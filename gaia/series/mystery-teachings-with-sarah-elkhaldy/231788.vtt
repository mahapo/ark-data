00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:19.000 align:middle line:10%
What if the people
who challenge us

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:21.400 align:middle line:10%
the most are actually
the ones pushing

00:00:21.400 --> 00:00:23.680 align:middle line:10%
us to awaken our true power?

00:00:23.680 --> 00:00:27.440 align:middle line:84%
These people are often seen
as petty tyrants, individuals

00:00:27.440 --> 00:00:32.240 align:middle line:84%
who seem to exist just
to test our limits.

00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:37.240 align:middle line:10%
The term "petty tyrants" was
coined by Carlos Castaneda

00:00:37.240 --> 00:00:41.320 align:middle line:10%
in his series of books on
The Teachings of Don Juan.

00:00:41.320 --> 00:00:44.360 align:middle line:84%
Petty tyrants are the
key right of passage

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:48.080 align:middle line:84%
within our own
spiritual awakening.

00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:50.800 align:middle line:84%
They are portals
and even vessels

00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:52.920 align:middle line:90%
that are used to attack us.

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:57.140 align:middle line:84%
They get activated
by our own growth.

00:00:57.140 --> 00:00:59.120 align:middle line:84%
They're triggered
by it, and that

00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:01.510 align:middle line:90%
makes them go into autopilot.

00:01:01.510 --> 00:01:04.709 align:middle line:84%
And when they're in autopilot,
what's really happening

00:01:04.709 --> 00:01:09.190 align:middle line:84%
is that their ego does not
like that we are stepping out

00:01:09.190 --> 00:01:10.090 align:middle line:90%
of the norm.

00:01:10.090 --> 00:01:13.510 align:middle line:84%
We are stepping out
of the status quo.

00:01:13.510 --> 00:01:16.350 align:middle line:84%
And so they're used
to intimidate us,

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:21.030 align:middle line:84%
and they're used to challenge us
as we're stepping into our power

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:23.470 align:middle line:84%
so that we go back
to sleep or we

00:01:23.470 --> 00:01:27.590 align:middle line:84%
stop moving through our
spiritual awakening.

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:30.510 align:middle line:84%
Petty tyrants show up
through our community,

00:01:30.510 --> 00:01:33.830 align:middle line:90%
through our friends and family--

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:38.670 align:middle line:84%
any way that we can learn and
that we interact with people

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:42.230 align:middle line:90%
on our spiritual path.

00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:45.550 align:middle line:84%
This is really a dynamic
that gets activated

00:01:45.550 --> 00:01:47.870 align:middle line:90%
by our own leveling up.

00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:49.830 align:middle line:84%
That is what's so important
to know about this

00:01:49.830 --> 00:01:52.710 align:middle line:84%
because it can really confuse
us when we're interacting

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:55.510 align:middle line:84%
with our coworkers, or we
have friends and family

00:01:55.510 --> 00:01:59.030 align:middle line:84%
that we normally have
a lot of harmony with.

00:01:59.030 --> 00:02:03.660 align:middle line:84%
Now, a certain pettiness
gets activated within them,

00:02:03.660 --> 00:02:08.860 align:middle line:84%
and they start becoming very
much like an oppositional force

00:02:08.860 --> 00:02:12.060 align:middle line:84%
to whatever our power is
that we're stepping into

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:14.620 align:middle line:84%
or whatever that truth
is that we have now owned

00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:17.740 align:middle line:90%
and we are now speaking.

00:02:17.740 --> 00:02:20.580 align:middle line:84%
And so this petty tyrant
dynamic can really

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:23.860 align:middle line:90%
be looked at as the ego.

00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:26.700 align:middle line:84%
When I'm referring to the
ego, I am specifically

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:30.460 align:middle line:84%
referring to the
individuated consciousness

00:02:30.460 --> 00:02:32.920 align:middle line:90%
that is overidentified.

00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:35.620 align:middle line:84%
So it's the part of us
that we have practiced

00:02:35.620 --> 00:02:39.300 align:middle line:84%
and we have repeated until
it's become habitual.

00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:42.260 align:middle line:84%
And when we're on
autopilot, this

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:45.980 align:middle line:84%
is the ego in its
most unconscious form.

00:02:45.980 --> 00:02:48.340 align:middle line:84%
It's the one that
is so overidentified

00:02:48.340 --> 00:02:51.260 align:middle line:84%
that it is in the sleep
state of consciousness.

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:55.520 align:middle line:84%
It fully believes it
is only its identity,

00:02:55.520 --> 00:02:59.380 align:middle line:90%
and it is only its patterns.

00:02:59.380 --> 00:03:03.140 align:middle line:84%
So it's any time that the
ego is operating in autopilot

00:03:03.140 --> 00:03:07.860 align:middle line:84%
or is unconscious, that now
it can be used as a vessel.

00:03:07.860 --> 00:03:10.080 align:middle line:84%
And that's what
petty tyrants are.

00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:13.100 align:middle line:90%


00:03:13.100 --> 00:03:15.140 align:middle line:84%
So it's not that these
people in our lives

00:03:15.140 --> 00:03:18.140 align:middle line:84%
always play this role for
us, but this is really

00:03:18.140 --> 00:03:23.100 align:middle line:84%
like the movie The Matrix,
where anyone inside our reality

00:03:23.100 --> 00:03:28.500 align:middle line:84%
can then be tapped into almost
like a portal for attacking

00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:31.500 align:middle line:90%
us or opposing us.

00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:34.420 align:middle line:84%
So just like an
agent in the movie

00:03:34.420 --> 00:03:39.700 align:middle line:84%
The Matrix, petty tyrants can be
plugged into through their ego

00:03:39.700 --> 00:03:44.260 align:middle line:84%
and used as a
program to attack us

00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:47.180 align:middle line:84%
if we're stepping
out of the norm

00:03:47.180 --> 00:03:49.530 align:middle line:84%
or we're awakening
outside of the matrix.

00:03:49.530 --> 00:03:53.900 align:middle line:90%


00:03:53.900 --> 00:03:59.010 align:middle line:84%
And they come into our reality
to make us go back in line,

00:03:59.010 --> 00:04:01.050 align:middle line:90%
go back asleep.

00:04:01.050 --> 00:04:04.490 align:middle line:84%
And so they act
as the moderators

00:04:04.490 --> 00:04:07.350 align:middle line:84%
of higher levels
of consciousness,

00:04:07.350 --> 00:04:10.130 align:middle line:84%
or even the gatekeepers
that we have

00:04:10.130 --> 00:04:14.210 align:middle line:84%
to face as that rite of
passage to that higher

00:04:14.210 --> 00:04:15.910 align:middle line:90%
level of consciousness.

00:04:15.910 --> 00:04:19.010 align:middle line:90%


00:04:19.010 --> 00:04:23.330 align:middle line:84%
But petty tyrants aren't always
just coworkers or friends

00:04:23.330 --> 00:04:25.450 align:middle line:90%
or even people in our community.

00:04:25.450 --> 00:04:29.650 align:middle line:84%
They could just be our
family on social media.

00:04:29.650 --> 00:04:34.650 align:middle line:84%
Because so many times when we
develop a really clear truth

00:04:34.650 --> 00:04:39.770 align:middle line:84%
or we need our truth clarified,
and the universe uses

00:04:39.770 --> 00:04:44.650 align:middle line:84%
a petty tyrant to help us create
that clarity within our truth

00:04:44.650 --> 00:04:48.970 align:middle line:84%
and create that clarity within
our new more empowering, larger

00:04:48.970 --> 00:04:53.130 align:middle line:84%
belief systems, we'll just
have family come online

00:04:53.130 --> 00:04:57.170 align:middle line:84%
and start activating and
being triggered by anything

00:04:57.170 --> 00:04:59.920 align:middle line:84%
that we find now
important and we

00:04:59.920 --> 00:05:03.540 align:middle line:84%
think is a part of
a larger worldview.

00:05:03.540 --> 00:05:06.600 align:middle line:90%


00:05:06.600 --> 00:05:10.520 align:middle line:10%
Any information that we're
now accumulating, whether it's

00:05:10.520 --> 00:05:15.440 align:middle line:10%
positive or negative about this
reality that is representing

00:05:15.440 --> 00:05:19.000 align:middle line:10%
something that is larger than
what the matrix currently

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:24.080 align:middle line:10%
presents us is something that
will definitely activate people,

00:05:24.080 --> 00:05:27.280 align:middle line:10%
and it will usually be,
if not in person, then

00:05:27.280 --> 00:05:30.360 align:middle line:10%
through just abstract comments
on our own social media

00:05:30.360 --> 00:05:31.160 align:middle line:10%
platforms.

00:05:31.160 --> 00:05:35.280 align:middle line:90%


00:05:35.280 --> 00:05:38.640 align:middle line:84%
So this dynamic isn't
always activated just

00:05:38.640 --> 00:05:44.760 align:middle line:84%
by anyone who disagrees with
us or anyone who has discourse.

00:05:44.760 --> 00:05:48.880 align:middle line:84%
Discourse is a powerful
tool for our own evolution.

00:05:48.880 --> 00:05:50.760 align:middle line:90%
This is more specific.

00:05:50.760 --> 00:05:54.640 align:middle line:84%
The petty tyrant has a
more personal investment

00:05:54.640 --> 00:05:58.830 align:middle line:84%
and is triggered deeper
than just discourse

00:05:58.830 --> 00:06:01.710 align:middle line:90%
from our own awakening.

00:06:01.710 --> 00:06:03.830 align:middle line:84%
And that's the
difference between just

00:06:03.830 --> 00:06:08.430 align:middle line:84%
organic disagreement
versus anyone in our life

00:06:08.430 --> 00:06:13.510 align:middle line:84%
that is now playing this
role of a petty tyrant that

00:06:13.510 --> 00:06:18.830 align:middle line:84%
is trying to stop us in some
way and at some capacity

00:06:18.830 --> 00:06:23.030 align:middle line:84%
from using our own voice
and using our own throat

00:06:23.030 --> 00:06:29.150 align:middle line:84%
center to speak our truth and
to really step into our power

00:06:29.150 --> 00:06:30.670 align:middle line:90%
stronger.

00:06:30.670 --> 00:06:33.590 align:middle line:84%
And that's the real
difference between these two.

00:06:33.590 --> 00:06:37.110 align:middle line:84%
It's something that's
way more personal.

00:06:37.110 --> 00:06:42.590 align:middle line:84%
It comes with a tinge of
even karmic flavor behind it.

00:06:42.590 --> 00:06:46.590 align:middle line:84%
As much as this can feel like
a personal vendetta against us,

00:06:46.590 --> 00:06:49.790 align:middle line:84%
the most interesting thing
about the petty tyrant dynamic

00:06:49.790 --> 00:06:53.070 align:middle line:84%
is that most of the
time, the petty tyrants

00:06:53.070 --> 00:06:54.590 align:middle line:84%
don't even know
that they're playing

00:06:54.590 --> 00:06:57.350 align:middle line:84%
this role inside our
spiritual initiation,

00:06:57.350 --> 00:07:01.980 align:middle line:84%
and they don't even know
why they're triggered.

00:07:01.980 --> 00:07:05.980 align:middle line:84%
In fact, this whole dynamic
takes place the strongest

00:07:05.980 --> 00:07:10.180 align:middle line:84%
within being completely unaware
and being completely unconscious

00:07:10.180 --> 00:07:13.540 align:middle line:84%
of their own
personal motivations.

00:07:13.540 --> 00:07:15.380 align:middle line:90%
They're just reacting.

00:07:15.380 --> 00:07:18.540 align:middle line:84%
They're just responding
to our own growth

00:07:18.540 --> 00:07:21.380 align:middle line:84%
because this growth is
representing something that

00:07:21.380 --> 00:07:26.220 align:middle line:84%
challenges the status quo, and
it challenges their own ego

00:07:26.220 --> 00:07:30.660 align:middle line:90%
and society's norms at large.

00:07:30.660 --> 00:07:35.220 align:middle line:84%
Petty tyrants operate mainly
through two hypnotic cues.

00:07:35.220 --> 00:07:41.060 align:middle line:84%
And the first one is,
who do you think you are?

00:07:41.060 --> 00:07:43.740 align:middle line:84%
Who do you think you
are is the strongest

00:07:43.740 --> 00:07:47.740 align:middle line:84%
way that the petty tyrant
affects us on our own journey

00:07:47.740 --> 00:07:50.220 align:middle line:90%
and even in our energy field.

00:07:50.220 --> 00:07:55.940 align:middle line:84%
This hypnotic cue even can
shrink us and diminish our power

00:07:55.940 --> 00:07:59.340 align:middle line:84%
back into the sleep state
of consciousness, which is

00:07:59.340 --> 00:08:02.540 align:middle line:90%
the whole goal of this dynamic.

00:08:02.540 --> 00:08:06.140 align:middle line:84%
It is to shrink us
through the energy

00:08:06.140 --> 00:08:10.030 align:middle line:84%
of who do you think you are
to even step into your power.

00:08:10.030 --> 00:08:13.780 align:middle line:90%


00:08:13.780 --> 00:08:16.580 align:middle line:84%
The second hypnotic cue
that the petty tyrant

00:08:16.580 --> 00:08:20.620 align:middle line:84%
uses to diminish our
power is something way

00:08:20.620 --> 00:08:24.220 align:middle line:84%
more unique and customized
to the person who's

00:08:24.220 --> 00:08:26.020 align:middle line:90%
receiving their attack.

00:08:26.020 --> 00:08:29.800 align:middle line:84%
So this is going to be something
that triggers us personally,

00:08:29.800 --> 00:08:34.500 align:middle line:84%
that they're aware of, and they
know is either wounding for us

00:08:34.500 --> 00:08:37.299 align:middle line:84%
or they know is a
deep trigger for us.

00:08:37.299 --> 00:08:41.620 align:middle line:84%
And it's purposely designed to
keep us into the societal norms

00:08:41.620 --> 00:08:44.780 align:middle line:84%
and away from whatever
we were doing.

00:08:44.780 --> 00:08:48.780 align:middle line:84%
So this one is going to be a lot
more customized, and anything

00:08:48.780 --> 00:08:53.460 align:middle line:84%
that has to do specifically
with the topic or the beliefs

00:08:53.460 --> 00:08:54.650 align:middle line:90%
that we're stepping into.

00:08:54.650 --> 00:08:58.970 align:middle line:90%


00:08:58.970 --> 00:09:03.170 align:middle line:84%
So what is the metaphysical
goal of the petty tyrant?

00:09:03.170 --> 00:09:06.410 align:middle line:90%
It is to keep us in line.

00:09:06.410 --> 00:09:10.330 align:middle line:84%
They keep us in line so
that we do not step out

00:09:10.330 --> 00:09:15.290 align:middle line:84%
of whatever is the status quo
and whatever the matrix wants

00:09:15.290 --> 00:09:19.970 align:middle line:84%
us to believe and how the matrix
wants us to behave and act.

00:09:19.970 --> 00:09:25.290 align:middle line:10%
They are triggered by our truth
because it represents something

00:09:25.290 --> 00:09:27.020 align:middle line:10%
that doesn't keep us in line.

00:09:27.020 --> 00:09:29.770 align:middle line:90%


00:09:29.770 --> 00:09:32.010 align:middle line:84%
In fact, the petty
tyrant is simply

00:09:32.010 --> 00:09:37.770 align:middle line:84%
activated by us questioning
things even at a mental level.

00:09:37.770 --> 00:09:40.890 align:middle line:84%
So anything that has
to do with us waking up

00:09:40.890 --> 00:09:43.450 align:middle line:84%
and anything that has to
do with us specifically

00:09:43.450 --> 00:09:45.890 align:middle line:84%
questioning our
reality will then

00:09:45.890 --> 00:09:49.210 align:middle line:84%
start awakening
the matrix to us.

00:09:49.210 --> 00:09:52.070 align:middle line:84%
And that's what activates
the petty tyrant.

00:09:52.070 --> 00:09:54.290 align:middle line:84%
It's the fact that
we're questioning things

00:09:54.290 --> 00:09:56.300 align:middle line:90%
and we're not going in line.

00:09:56.300 --> 00:10:01.920 align:middle line:90%


00:10:01.920 --> 00:10:05.120 align:middle line:84%
Now, as we progress on
our own spiritual journey,

00:10:05.120 --> 00:10:07.820 align:middle line:84%
even the petty tyrant
dynamic shifts,

00:10:07.820 --> 00:10:10.720 align:middle line:84%
so they're not always going to
be playing the same exact role

00:10:10.720 --> 00:10:12.480 align:middle line:84%
in our growth, and
they won't even

00:10:12.480 --> 00:10:15.600 align:middle line:84%
be reflecting always
the same lessons

00:10:15.600 --> 00:10:17.300 align:middle line:90%
that we need to now learn.

00:10:17.300 --> 00:10:19.760 align:middle line:84%
For instance, in the
beginning of our journey,

00:10:19.760 --> 00:10:22.560 align:middle line:84%
petty tyrants play
a stronger role

00:10:22.560 --> 00:10:25.160 align:middle line:84%
with our ability
to really develop

00:10:25.160 --> 00:10:29.160 align:middle line:90%
discernment and integrity.

00:10:29.160 --> 00:10:33.000 align:middle line:84%
So if we have the integrity
to stand tall and strong

00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:35.440 align:middle line:84%
through this petty
tyrant dynamic,

00:10:35.440 --> 00:10:37.840 align:middle line:84%
now we're able to
progress into the deeper

00:10:37.840 --> 00:10:42.440 align:middle line:90%
stages of our own development.

00:10:42.440 --> 00:10:46.880 align:middle line:84%
And so, in these middle stages
of the petty tyrant dynamic,

00:10:46.880 --> 00:10:49.585 align:middle line:90%
now they evolve as we evolve.

00:10:49.585 --> 00:10:50.960 align:middle line:84%
And now what
they're really doing

00:10:50.960 --> 00:10:57.390 align:middle line:84%
is playing more of
a soundboard for us.

00:10:57.390 --> 00:11:00.870 align:middle line:84%
So what they're doing
is clarifying our truth.

00:11:00.870 --> 00:11:03.430 align:middle line:84%
How will we know
if what we believe

00:11:03.430 --> 00:11:07.230 align:middle line:84%
is true is something that
we genuinely feel and know

00:11:07.230 --> 00:11:11.630 align:middle line:84%
is true, unless it's
played back to us?

00:11:11.630 --> 00:11:13.670 align:middle line:90%
So now we're being challenged.

00:11:13.670 --> 00:11:16.550 align:middle line:84%
But the challenge is to
really purify our truth

00:11:16.550 --> 00:11:18.940 align:middle line:84%
and help us clarify
our belief systems.

00:11:18.940 --> 00:11:24.310 align:middle line:90%


00:11:24.310 --> 00:11:27.930 align:middle line:84%
Once we've progressed more
into this larger awareness

00:11:27.930 --> 00:11:32.390 align:middle line:84%
and we have more clarity around
ourselves and our journey,

00:11:32.390 --> 00:11:35.710 align:middle line:84%
now the petty tyrants
develop with us

00:11:35.710 --> 00:11:40.230 align:middle line:90%
and progress into a new stage.

00:11:40.230 --> 00:11:43.110 align:middle line:84%
So the last stage
of the petty tyrants

00:11:43.110 --> 00:11:46.630 align:middle line:84%
is the one that reflects
the most honest things

00:11:46.630 --> 00:11:49.810 align:middle line:84%
inside our energy field that
really do need to be worked on,

00:11:49.810 --> 00:11:52.670 align:middle line:84%
and we're not just
being attacked for.

00:11:52.670 --> 00:11:56.070 align:middle line:84%
They're the ones where we
genuinely need to be balanced

00:11:56.070 --> 00:12:01.630 align:middle line:84%
and things that we genuinely
have blind spots around.

00:12:01.630 --> 00:12:03.830 align:middle line:84%
The chakra that
is being activated

00:12:03.830 --> 00:12:08.190 align:middle line:84%
through the petty tyrant the
most is the throat chakra.

00:12:08.190 --> 00:12:11.810 align:middle line:84%
The throat chakra is how we
communicate with the world,

00:12:11.810 --> 00:12:17.590 align:middle line:84%
and it's our portal for our own
interior and internal truth.

00:12:17.590 --> 00:12:20.110 align:middle line:84%
That is what needs
to really get opened.

00:12:20.110 --> 00:12:23.430 align:middle line:84%
And that's something that so
many people struggle with.

00:12:23.430 --> 00:12:25.670 align:middle line:84%
And because of
that, petty tyrants

00:12:25.670 --> 00:12:28.750 align:middle line:84%
are the perfect vessel
and the perfect tool

00:12:28.750 --> 00:12:31.550 align:middle line:84%
for helping us open
our throat center

00:12:31.550 --> 00:12:36.270 align:middle line:84%
and help us speak our truth
through that oppositional force

00:12:36.270 --> 00:12:38.470 align:middle line:90%
that they play.

00:12:38.470 --> 00:12:43.030 align:middle line:84%
This is the major energy
center that the petty tyrants

00:12:43.030 --> 00:12:46.450 align:middle line:84%
go after because they're
trying to shut it down.

00:12:46.450 --> 00:12:49.750 align:middle line:84%
But at the same time, the
whole point of this dynamic

00:12:49.750 --> 00:12:53.350 align:middle line:84%
is so that it gets activated
and that we do open it

00:12:53.350 --> 00:12:54.930 align:middle line:90%
and we start to use it.

00:12:54.930 --> 00:12:57.900 align:middle line:84%
And that's the real
spiritual lesson here.

00:12:57.900 --> 00:13:00.580 align:middle line:84%
It's that, yes,
the petty tyrants

00:13:00.580 --> 00:13:02.200 align:middle line:90%
are interplaying with us.

00:13:02.200 --> 00:13:04.420 align:middle line:84%
And yes, there's so
much conflict and stress

00:13:04.420 --> 00:13:06.980 align:middle line:84%
that incurs from this
dynamic, but it's

00:13:06.980 --> 00:13:11.940 align:middle line:84%
for us to open up our throat
chakra so that we can speak

00:13:11.940 --> 00:13:15.940 align:middle line:84%
our truth no matter what the
consequences and no matter

00:13:15.940 --> 00:13:19.830 align:middle line:84%
what difference of opinion we're
experiencing with our reality.

00:13:19.830 --> 00:13:25.660 align:middle line:90%


00:13:25.660 --> 00:13:30.060 align:middle line:84%
Now, in the earlier stages of
petty tyrant dynamics, what

00:13:30.060 --> 00:13:32.220 align:middle line:84%
we're really doing
with the throat chakra

00:13:32.220 --> 00:13:35.620 align:middle line:84%
is learning how to
assert our boundaries.

00:13:35.620 --> 00:13:38.620 align:middle line:84%
Boundaries are number
one here, and once we've

00:13:38.620 --> 00:13:41.420 align:middle line:84%
got that really going,
and once we've understand

00:13:41.420 --> 00:13:45.300 align:middle line:84%
and started to
integrate how to assert

00:13:45.300 --> 00:13:47.740 align:middle line:84%
our boundaries through
the throat chakra,

00:13:47.740 --> 00:13:51.700 align:middle line:84%
through our voice,
then now it unfolds,

00:13:51.700 --> 00:13:54.690 align:middle line:84%
and it becomes where we're
learning how to use our throat

00:13:54.690 --> 00:14:00.890 align:middle line:84%
chakra to clarify our beliefs
and to speak whatever we believe

00:14:00.890 --> 00:14:04.130 align:middle line:84%
and whatever we want to share
with the world around what

00:14:04.130 --> 00:14:06.850 align:middle line:84%
is personal and more
intimate to us--

00:14:06.850 --> 00:14:09.020 align:middle line:90%
what we find to be our truth.

00:14:09.020 --> 00:14:12.570 align:middle line:90%


00:14:12.570 --> 00:14:16.090 align:middle line:84%
In later stages of this
petty tyrant dynamic,

00:14:16.090 --> 00:14:20.130 align:middle line:84%
now we may no longer need
that level of confrontation

00:14:20.130 --> 00:14:21.170 align:middle line:90%
from them.

00:14:21.170 --> 00:14:25.490 align:middle line:84%
And instead, what's happening
is that our throat chakra is now

00:14:25.490 --> 00:14:29.090 align:middle line:84%
learning how to come
into its subtle power.

00:14:29.090 --> 00:14:32.370 align:middle line:84%
And this could be sheerly
by speaking our truth

00:14:32.370 --> 00:14:36.770 align:middle line:84%
and allowing them
to be acknowledged.

00:14:36.770 --> 00:14:39.050 align:middle line:84%
So the question
becomes, how do we

00:14:39.050 --> 00:14:41.330 align:middle line:90%
deal with these petty tyrants?

00:14:41.330 --> 00:14:43.690 align:middle line:84%
Well, most of the
time, they're teaching

00:14:43.690 --> 00:14:48.590 align:middle line:84%
us boundaries through our throat
chakra and through our world.

00:14:48.590 --> 00:14:51.050 align:middle line:84%
So boundaries is going
to be the best way

00:14:51.050 --> 00:14:53.110 align:middle line:84%
that we deal with
the petty tyrants

00:14:53.110 --> 00:14:54.900 align:middle line:84%
because they're
teaching us boundaries,

00:14:54.900 --> 00:14:57.600 align:middle line:84%
and they're teaching us to
be comfortable with setting

00:14:57.600 --> 00:15:00.640 align:middle line:90%
boundaries very clear ones.

00:15:00.640 --> 00:15:03.660 align:middle line:84%
But after that lesson
has really been mastered

00:15:03.660 --> 00:15:05.920 align:middle line:84%
and it's no longer
something that we

00:15:05.920 --> 00:15:10.200 align:middle line:84%
have to keep implementing,
now, the best way

00:15:10.200 --> 00:15:13.880 align:middle line:84%
to deal with the petty tyrants
is through ignoring them,

00:15:13.880 --> 00:15:17.160 align:middle line:84%
and even sometimes if we
have to-- blocking them.

00:15:17.160 --> 00:15:19.380 align:middle line:84%
These would be the
most effective ways

00:15:19.380 --> 00:15:22.100 align:middle line:84%
once we've already
learned the lessons.

00:15:22.100 --> 00:15:24.600 align:middle line:84%
Once we've already
set the boundaries,

00:15:24.600 --> 00:15:29.480 align:middle line:84%
now it becomes more
about our mental mastery.

00:15:29.480 --> 00:15:35.000 align:middle line:84%
And if we learn how to ignore
really petty dynamics at play,

00:15:35.000 --> 00:15:37.410 align:middle line:84%
then now we're the masters
of our own reality.

00:15:37.410 --> 00:15:42.080 align:middle line:90%


00:15:42.080 --> 00:15:45.720 align:middle line:84%
So the sacred purpose that
the petty tyrant is playing

00:15:45.720 --> 00:15:50.760 align:middle line:84%
is one to help us become
comfortable with our own power,

00:15:50.760 --> 00:15:55.190 align:middle line:84%
help us step into our
power, even under pressure.

00:15:55.190 --> 00:15:59.750 align:middle line:84%
Because what is power if we're
not always embodying it even

00:15:59.750 --> 00:16:01.770 align:middle line:90%
under conflict or pressure?

00:16:01.770 --> 00:16:04.830 align:middle line:84%
And what is integrity
and strength if it is not

00:16:04.830 --> 00:16:07.510 align:middle line:90%
tested even under pressure?

00:16:07.510 --> 00:16:09.630 align:middle line:84%
So this is the
real sacred purpose

00:16:09.630 --> 00:16:11.530 align:middle line:90%
behind the petty tyrants.

00:16:11.530 --> 00:16:15.470 align:middle line:84%
It's to help us become more
comfortable with our power

00:16:15.470 --> 00:16:16.300 align:middle line:90%
under pressure.

00:16:16.300 --> 00:16:20.310 align:middle line:90%


00:16:20.310 --> 00:16:23.550 align:middle line:84%
Once we understand that
we're stepping into our power

00:16:23.550 --> 00:16:26.550 align:middle line:84%
and that we're enduring
it under pressure,

00:16:26.550 --> 00:16:30.510 align:middle line:84%
now there will not even
be fear of retaliation

00:16:30.510 --> 00:16:34.790 align:middle line:84%
once we fully opened our throat
center through their lessons,

00:16:34.790 --> 00:16:36.510 align:middle line:90%
but also our heart.

00:16:36.510 --> 00:16:40.350 align:middle line:84%
Because once we're
out of the tension

00:16:40.350 --> 00:16:43.950 align:middle line:84%
and once we're out of the fear
of stepping into our power,

00:16:43.950 --> 00:16:46.590 align:middle line:84%
now, we don't fear
their retaliation,

00:16:46.590 --> 00:16:49.310 align:middle line:90%
or we don't fear consequences.

00:16:49.310 --> 00:16:51.650 align:middle line:84%
And that allows us
to open our heart.

00:16:51.650 --> 00:16:55.310 align:middle line:84%
And this is really what becoming
unconditionally loving is about.

00:16:55.310 --> 00:17:00.030 align:middle line:84%
It's about having no conditions
and not being under any fear

00:17:00.030 --> 00:17:01.910 align:middle line:90%
of repercussions.

00:17:01.910 --> 00:17:07.349 align:middle line:84%
So our heart center is also
activated through this dynamic.

00:17:07.349 --> 00:17:11.630 align:middle line:84%
So what is the takeaway from
this petty tyrant dynamic?

00:17:11.630 --> 00:17:14.150 align:middle line:84%
It is don't wait
for others to match

00:17:14.150 --> 00:17:16.510 align:middle line:90%
your personal level of growth.

00:17:16.510 --> 00:17:21.109 align:middle line:84%
Don't wait for others to match
whatever your stepping into now

00:17:21.109 --> 00:17:23.990 align:middle line:84%
and whatever you
find to be the truth.

00:17:23.990 --> 00:17:29.070 align:middle line:84%
True spiritual power comes
from being unapologetically

00:17:29.070 --> 00:17:31.330 align:middle line:90%
and unconditionally yourself.

00:17:31.330 --> 00:17:35.110 align:middle line:90%


00:17:35.110 --> 00:17:38.270 align:middle line:84%
Spirit uses the petty
tyrant as a catalyst

00:17:38.270 --> 00:17:44.550 align:middle line:84%
so that we can be the embodiment
of our higher self at all times.

00:17:44.550 --> 00:17:47.910 align:middle line:84%
The medicine of the petty
tyrant is multifold,

00:17:47.910 --> 00:17:51.070 align:middle line:84%
but heavily revolves
around inner authority

00:17:51.070 --> 00:17:53.940 align:middle line:90%
versus external authority.

00:17:53.940 --> 00:17:56.180 align:middle line:90%
It teaches us to stop hiding.

00:17:56.180 --> 00:18:00.300 align:middle line:84%
Do not wait for others to
go first or to awaken first

00:18:00.300 --> 00:18:03.420 align:middle line:84%
or to be more conscious first
or to give us permission

00:18:03.420 --> 00:18:05.220 align:middle line:90%
to be powerful first.

00:18:05.220 --> 00:18:07.700 align:middle line:84%
They teach us to
question, why on earth

00:18:07.700 --> 00:18:11.100 align:middle line:90%
did we ever need a first?

00:18:11.100 --> 00:18:14.260 align:middle line:84%
Petty tyrants, though they
appear as adversaries,

00:18:14.260 --> 00:18:18.980 align:middle line:84%
are the mirrors that reflect
our deepest fears and unspoken

00:18:18.980 --> 00:18:22.030 align:middle line:84%
truths, urging us
to claim our power.

00:18:22.030 --> 00:18:24.740 align:middle line:90%


00:18:24.740 --> 00:18:27.300 align:middle line:84%
By embracing them
as catalysts, we

00:18:27.300 --> 00:18:30.860 align:middle line:84%
rise above ego and
external control,

00:18:30.860 --> 00:18:35.300 align:middle line:84%
stepping fully into
our authentic selves.

00:18:35.300 --> 00:18:39.820 align:middle line:84%
The real question is, can
you stand firm in your truth

00:18:39.820 --> 00:18:45.020 align:middle line:84%
and transform their resistance
into your highest potential?
