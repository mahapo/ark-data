00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:21.960 align:middle line:10%
What if the power to transform
your life is already within you.

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:24.710 align:middle line:84%
The chakra system
is your blueprint

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:28.140 align:middle line:84%
for unlocking your
fullest potential,

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:34.100 align:middle line:84%
guiding you from survival
instincts to spiritual mastery.

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:36.380 align:middle line:84%
In this episode,
you will discover

00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:39.320 align:middle line:84%
how these energy centers
shape your reality

00:00:39.320 --> 00:00:45.380 align:middle line:84%
and how to harness their power
to create the life you deserve.

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:49.430 align:middle line:84%
The chakra system is the
core foundational part

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:51.480 align:middle line:90%
of all spiritual knowledge.

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:55.580 align:middle line:84%
It is incorporated into every
spiritual system, both Eastern

00:00:55.580 --> 00:00:56.960 align:middle line:90%
and Western.

00:00:56.960 --> 00:01:00.230 align:middle line:84%
So let's break down what
this term chakra means.

00:01:00.230 --> 00:01:06.890 align:middle line:84%
In Sanskrit, this term literally
translates to cycle or a wheel.

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:10.610 align:middle line:84%
When we think of what this
means as an energy center being

00:01:10.610 --> 00:01:14.300 align:middle line:84%
portrayed as a wheel, what
we're really looking at

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:19.550 align:middle line:84%
is that this energy centers
are actually vortexes and even

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:26.480 align:middle line:84%
portals that are transmitting
and both absorbing archetypal

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:27.800 align:middle line:90%
energy.

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:32.330 align:middle line:84%
Some spiritual systems
perceive 144 energy centers

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:34.230 align:middle line:90%
within our energy field.

00:01:34.230 --> 00:01:38.270 align:middle line:84%
Some other systems see a
hard 15 dimensional framework

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:42.210 align:middle line:84%
that corresponds to every
part of our energy field.

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:44.100 align:middle line:90%
Some perceive 14.

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:46.530 align:middle line:90%
Others see 12, 8.

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:49.610 align:middle line:84%
In truth, there
are energy centers

00:01:49.610 --> 00:01:53.190 align:middle line:84%
going every which
way within our field.

00:01:53.190 --> 00:01:57.500 align:middle line:84%
So we're going to focus on
the classical seven chakra

00:01:57.500 --> 00:02:02.690 align:middle line:84%
system that are
foundational to all systems.

00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:05.900 align:middle line:84%
So we're going to start
with the root chakra.

00:02:05.900 --> 00:02:09.900 align:middle line:84%
The root chakra is known
as the Muladhara chakra.

00:02:09.900 --> 00:02:12.350 align:middle line:84%
And this in Sanskrit
translates directly

00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:14.730 align:middle line:90%
over to source, support.

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:16.280 align:middle line:84%
And that would be
the perfect way

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:20.270 align:middle line:84%
to identify this energy
center, because it is all

00:02:20.270 --> 00:02:25.370 align:middle line:84%
about source and support, but
from the survival instincts

00:02:25.370 --> 00:02:28.820 align:middle line:84%
and from the
perception of security.

00:02:28.820 --> 00:02:32.030 align:middle line:84%
So we're actually not talking
about source consciousness

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:34.200 align:middle line:84%
when we're talking
about source here,

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:36.920 align:middle line:90%
we're talking about resources.

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:39.080 align:middle line:90%
And what are resources?

00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:42.630 align:middle line:84%
Resources lead to a sense
of not just security,

00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:46.100 align:middle line:84%
but even can unfold
into abundance.

00:02:46.100 --> 00:02:52.370 align:middle line:10%
The root center is responsible
for having us acquire and secure

00:02:52.370 --> 00:02:56.040 align:middle line:10%
resources, and that's how
it will feel supported.

00:02:56.040 --> 00:02:59.430 align:middle line:84%
This is the major truth
and the major perception

00:02:59.430 --> 00:03:01.840 align:middle line:90%
that comes from this chakra.

00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:07.320 align:middle line:84%
It is one that is core to our
ability to feel safe enough

00:03:07.320 --> 00:03:10.060 align:middle line:90%
to embody resources.

00:03:10.060 --> 00:03:16.090 align:middle line:84%
And that is why finances are
so linked with the root center.

00:03:16.090 --> 00:03:18.220 align:middle line:90%
It's because, what are finances?

00:03:18.220 --> 00:03:23.560 align:middle line:84%
They're our ability to acquire
resources and security.

00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:27.210 align:middle line:10%
And that's why this energy
center is strongly tied

00:03:27.210 --> 00:03:30.990 align:middle line:10%
into the themes of money,
finances, and our ability

00:03:30.990 --> 00:03:32.670 align:middle line:10%
to heal.

00:03:32.670 --> 00:03:35.790 align:middle line:84%
The reason why this
energy center is so

00:03:35.790 --> 00:03:38.850 align:middle line:84%
linked with our health and
our physical well-being

00:03:38.850 --> 00:03:43.110 align:middle line:84%
is because our physical
well-being depends on how much

00:03:43.110 --> 00:03:48.010 align:middle line:84%
we feel anchored and rooted
into the physical realm,

00:03:48.010 --> 00:03:51.190 align:middle line:84%
and that's how
health gets produced.

00:03:51.190 --> 00:03:54.960 align:middle line:84%
So healing and health
are both very connected

00:03:54.960 --> 00:04:00.240 align:middle line:84%
with our ability to feel
like we belong here.

00:04:00.240 --> 00:04:03.330 align:middle line:84%
And the root center
is the foundation

00:04:03.330 --> 00:04:06.220 align:middle line:84%
for all of the other
energy centers.

00:04:06.220 --> 00:04:10.680 align:middle line:84%
So we have a strong base
and we build on that

00:04:10.680 --> 00:04:15.210 align:middle line:84%
to our next energy center,
which is the sacral chakra.

00:04:15.210 --> 00:04:19.800 align:middle line:84%
The sacral chakra is equated
with the symbolism of water

00:04:19.800 --> 00:04:25.530 align:middle line:84%
because it is the fluidity
of our soul stream.

00:04:25.530 --> 00:04:29.010 align:middle line:84%
This energy center
is mainly responsible

00:04:29.010 --> 00:04:35.910 align:middle line:84%
and comes from the perception
of identity through creativity.

00:04:35.910 --> 00:04:38.170 align:middle line:90%
It is our creative identity.

00:04:38.170 --> 00:04:43.350 align:middle line:84%
It is the identity of our
emotional, sensual self.

00:04:43.350 --> 00:04:47.340 align:middle line:84%
That's why this energy
center is intimately linked

00:04:47.340 --> 00:04:53.430 align:middle line:84%
with our sexuality, because
sexual energy is really

00:04:53.430 --> 00:04:55.320 align:middle line:90%
creative energy.

00:04:55.320 --> 00:05:00.840 align:middle line:84%
Our unique soul stream being
conveyed through this energy

00:05:00.840 --> 00:05:07.200 align:middle line:84%
center mainly through our
artistic and sensual expression.

00:05:07.200 --> 00:05:09.450 align:middle line:84%
So this is the
energy center that

00:05:09.450 --> 00:05:13.620 align:middle line:84%
is most linked with our
emotional body and emotions.

00:05:13.620 --> 00:05:18.240 align:middle line:84%
But its truth also is
one that is based off

00:05:18.240 --> 00:05:21.940 align:middle line:84%
of our ability to feel
secure and safe in the world.

00:05:21.940 --> 00:05:25.380 align:middle line:84%
It's just that this sort
of safety and security

00:05:25.380 --> 00:05:28.090 align:middle line:84%
is much different
than the root centers.

00:05:28.090 --> 00:05:30.270 align:middle line:84%
It is what would
we do if we didn't

00:05:30.270 --> 00:05:34.140 align:middle line:84%
have to worry about our
core and most basic needs.

00:05:34.140 --> 00:05:38.820 align:middle line:84%
This energy center is
about our expression free

00:05:38.820 --> 00:05:42.930 align:middle line:84%
of being in fear or
in need of security.

00:05:42.930 --> 00:05:49.200 align:middle line:84%
It is about how we would show
up in our most fluid form,

00:05:49.200 --> 00:05:52.170 align:middle line:84%
because the sacral
chakra is our ability

00:05:52.170 --> 00:05:55.990 align:middle line:90%
to also receive and attract.

00:05:55.990 --> 00:05:59.310 align:middle line:84%
So when we're talking
about manifestation,

00:05:59.310 --> 00:06:01.710 align:middle line:84%
this center's very
important for that

00:06:01.710 --> 00:06:04.830 align:middle line:84%
because this is our center
where we're drawing forth

00:06:04.830 --> 00:06:08.970 align:middle line:84%
and we're attracting and
even magnetizing those things

00:06:08.970 --> 00:06:10.383 align:middle line:90%
that we're wanting to manifest.

00:06:10.383 --> 00:06:13.530 align:middle line:90%


00:06:13.530 --> 00:06:16.350 align:middle line:84%
When it really comes
to our identity

00:06:16.350 --> 00:06:21.630 align:middle line:84%
here in the physical realm,
the two lower centers add up

00:06:21.630 --> 00:06:26.410 align:middle line:84%
and they accumulate here
at the solar plexus region.

00:06:26.410 --> 00:06:31.380 align:middle line:84%
This is where the three lower
energy centers all combine.

00:06:31.380 --> 00:06:34.950 align:middle line:84%
Now, if the root center
has a core truth of one

00:06:34.950 --> 00:06:39.280 align:middle line:84%
of belonging and accumulating
resources to feel safe,

00:06:39.280 --> 00:06:43.290 align:middle line:84%
and the sacral chakra has a
truth and a perception that

00:06:43.290 --> 00:06:46.570 align:middle line:84%
comes from our creative,
unique expression,

00:06:46.570 --> 00:06:51.810 align:middle line:84%
then the solar plexus region is
our ability to feel worthy here

00:06:51.810 --> 00:06:55.960 align:middle line:84%
and to feel confident
enough to be visible.

00:06:55.960 --> 00:06:59.760 align:middle line:84%
If there were a key word to
equate the solar plexus region

00:06:59.760 --> 00:07:02.700 align:middle line:90%
with, it would be visibility.

00:07:02.700 --> 00:07:07.540 align:middle line:84%
Because this energy center is
known, for better or for worse,

00:07:07.540 --> 00:07:12.400 align:middle line:84%
with being intimately linked
with our ability to have drive,

00:07:12.400 --> 00:07:15.130 align:middle line:90%
to have ambition and motivation.

00:07:15.130 --> 00:07:18.690 align:middle line:84%
It is our ability
to feel safe enough

00:07:18.690 --> 00:07:22.830 align:middle line:84%
to go after what we wish
to accomplish and achieve

00:07:22.830 --> 00:07:27.510 align:middle line:84%
within this physical realm,
moving in the direction of that

00:07:27.510 --> 00:07:30.510 align:middle line:90%
which we wish to experience.

00:07:30.510 --> 00:07:33.690 align:middle line:84%
The solar plexus region
is the energy center

00:07:33.690 --> 00:07:38.530 align:middle line:84%
where we develop and heal
themes around self-worth,

00:07:38.530 --> 00:07:43.080 align:middle line:84%
worthiness, and the willpower
that comes with that ability

00:07:43.080 --> 00:07:44.580 align:middle line:90%
to feel worthy.

00:07:44.580 --> 00:07:49.260 align:middle line:84%
Confidence and willpower
and even ambition all

00:07:49.260 --> 00:07:52.470 align:middle line:90%
are facets of self-worth.

00:07:52.470 --> 00:07:55.440 align:middle line:84%
And this worthiness
is the number one core

00:07:55.440 --> 00:07:59.970 align:middle line:84%
theme that the solar
plexus region emits.

00:07:59.970 --> 00:08:03.930 align:middle line:84%
So these three lower
energy centers all

00:08:03.930 --> 00:08:08.890 align:middle line:84%
make up our lower
physical egoic identity.

00:08:08.890 --> 00:08:12.180 align:middle line:84%
And then we have
the higher centers

00:08:12.180 --> 00:08:15.700 align:middle line:84%
that represent our
spiritual identity,

00:08:15.700 --> 00:08:18.260 align:middle line:84%
and they all meet up
in the heart center.

00:08:18.260 --> 00:08:21.690 align:middle line:90%


00:08:21.690 --> 00:08:25.020 align:middle line:84%
The heart chakra is
responsible for being

00:08:25.020 --> 00:08:30.100 align:middle line:84%
the bridge between the lower
identity and the physical world,

00:08:30.100 --> 00:08:34.360 align:middle line:84%
as well as our higher self,
our higher energy centers,

00:08:34.360 --> 00:08:36.840 align:middle line:90%
and the spiritual world.

00:08:36.840 --> 00:08:42.820 align:middle line:84%
The heart center is what holds
all paradoxes and all duality.

00:08:42.820 --> 00:08:45.240 align:middle line:84%
So within this
energy center, you

00:08:45.240 --> 00:08:47.950 align:middle line:84%
can imagine how
much space it holds.

00:08:47.950 --> 00:08:52.310 align:middle line:84%
In fact, it is the unified
field of consciousness itself.

00:08:52.310 --> 00:08:56.050 align:middle line:84%
It's just being represented
in the fractal form.

00:08:56.050 --> 00:09:00.940 align:middle line:84%
The heart chakra is known in
Sanskrit as the Anahata chakra,

00:09:00.940 --> 00:09:04.720 align:middle line:84%
and what this translates
directly as is the unstruck

00:09:04.720 --> 00:09:06.220 align:middle line:90%
sound.

00:09:06.220 --> 00:09:09.160 align:middle line:84%
So this is what we are talking
about when we're really

00:09:09.160 --> 00:09:10.940 align:middle line:90%
talking about oneness.

00:09:10.940 --> 00:09:14.300 align:middle line:84%
The heart center is
our primordial oneness.

00:09:14.300 --> 00:09:19.070 align:middle line:84%
It is the causeless cause,
as they say in esotericism,

00:09:19.070 --> 00:09:24.790 align:middle line:84%
the creator and the created
before there was any separation.

00:09:24.790 --> 00:09:28.220 align:middle line:90%
So this is the original sound.

00:09:28.220 --> 00:09:31.600 align:middle line:84%
And that's why
this energy center

00:09:31.600 --> 00:09:37.030 align:middle line:84%
is known for having compassion,
forgiveness, and empathy.

00:09:37.030 --> 00:09:40.670 align:middle line:84%
And if we really think
about what compassion is,

00:09:40.670 --> 00:09:46.540 align:middle line:84%
compassion is our oneness, our
shared experience with others

00:09:46.540 --> 00:09:49.780 align:middle line:90%
beyond our physical vehicle.

00:09:49.780 --> 00:09:55.330 align:middle line:84%
We are all one at the very
core, and this whole experience

00:09:55.330 --> 00:09:58.550 align:middle line:84%
is based off of that
unconditional love.

00:09:58.550 --> 00:10:01.300 align:middle line:84%
So this is what's important
to understand when

00:10:01.300 --> 00:10:03.670 align:middle line:90%
we're talking about compassion.

00:10:03.670 --> 00:10:05.230 align:middle line:90%
It's coming from one.

00:10:05.230 --> 00:10:11.440 align:middle line:84%
That is, observing all of
this reality from a Canvas

00:10:11.440 --> 00:10:14.300 align:middle line:90%
or a stage of love.

00:10:14.300 --> 00:10:17.050 align:middle line:84%
And this love is
the backdrop that

00:10:17.050 --> 00:10:20.830 align:middle line:84%
allows us to have this
physical experience.

00:10:20.830 --> 00:10:24.130 align:middle line:84%
So the heart chakra being
the bridge between the lower

00:10:24.130 --> 00:10:28.930 align:middle line:84%
realms and the lower chakras and
the higher realm and the higher

00:10:28.930 --> 00:10:34.070 align:middle line:84%
chakras, now we ascend
into the higher chakras,

00:10:34.070 --> 00:10:38.320 align:middle line:90%
starting with the throat chakra.

00:10:38.320 --> 00:10:41.950 align:middle line:84%
The throat chakra is
our portal of truth

00:10:41.950 --> 00:10:46.160 align:middle line:84%
and it even is known
for purifying truth.

00:10:46.160 --> 00:10:50.170 align:middle line:84%
Now many of us think that
purification of truth

00:10:50.170 --> 00:10:52.630 align:middle line:84%
is probably one of
the least things that

00:10:52.630 --> 00:10:54.790 align:middle line:90%
come out of this energy center.

00:10:54.790 --> 00:10:58.760 align:middle line:84%
But how will we know
what is true for us

00:10:58.760 --> 00:11:04.120 align:middle line:84%
unless we use this vital portal
to be able to speak our truth.

00:11:04.120 --> 00:11:07.550 align:middle line:84%
That is why it's a
purification center.

00:11:07.550 --> 00:11:10.150 align:middle line:84%
It's because the
more that we are

00:11:10.150 --> 00:11:13.900 align:middle line:84%
able to communicate our inner
world, our inner thoughts

00:11:13.900 --> 00:11:19.690 align:middle line:84%
and inner reality to the outer
world, now all of the truths

00:11:19.690 --> 00:11:23.770 align:middle line:84%
meet up and all of
them start to purify

00:11:23.770 --> 00:11:25.670 align:middle line:90%
and mingle with one another.

00:11:25.670 --> 00:11:29.690 align:middle line:84%
And that's what this chakra
is most responsible for.

00:11:29.690 --> 00:11:33.380 align:middle line:84%
It is speaking and
conveying our truth.

00:11:33.380 --> 00:11:37.670 align:middle line:84%
And through that speaking
and voicing of our truth,

00:11:37.670 --> 00:11:39.560 align:middle line:90%
we are able to purify it.

00:11:39.560 --> 00:11:42.400 align:middle line:84%
We are able to have
more clarity around it

00:11:42.400 --> 00:11:45.610 align:middle line:84%
and therefore always
be able to refine

00:11:45.610 --> 00:11:48.050 align:middle line:90%
our reality and our truth.

00:11:48.050 --> 00:11:52.550 align:middle line:84%
So the throat chakra has a
very large responsibility.

00:11:52.550 --> 00:11:55.000 align:middle line:84%
It has the
responsibility of being

00:11:55.000 --> 00:11:59.720 align:middle line:84%
able to communicate and
to share who we are,

00:11:59.720 --> 00:12:04.780 align:middle line:84%
who all of our energy centers
leading up and culminating

00:12:04.780 --> 00:12:08.770 align:middle line:84%
to the throat chakra are,
and then speaking that

00:12:08.770 --> 00:12:10.100 align:middle line:90%
into the world.

00:12:10.100 --> 00:12:12.190 align:middle line:84%
And it's through this
portal that we're

00:12:12.190 --> 00:12:17.230 align:middle line:84%
able to really share our reality
and really share our identity

00:12:17.230 --> 00:12:19.690 align:middle line:90%
with the external world.

00:12:19.690 --> 00:12:23.840 align:middle line:84%
So as we purify our truth
through the throat chakra,

00:12:23.840 --> 00:12:27.130 align:middle line:84%
now our perception
becomes more and more

00:12:27.130 --> 00:12:31.693 align:middle line:84%
refined until it awakens
into the third eye chakra.

00:12:31.693 --> 00:12:34.360 align:middle line:90%


00:12:34.360 --> 00:12:39.200 align:middle line:84%
The third eye chakra is possibly
the most popular chakra.

00:12:39.200 --> 00:12:43.690 align:middle line:84%
This chakra is located directly
in the center of the eyebrows

00:12:43.690 --> 00:12:47.000 align:middle line:84%
and then pulled
deeper into the brain,

00:12:47.000 --> 00:12:50.590 align:middle line:84%
right at the intersection with
the middle of the skull where

00:12:50.590 --> 00:12:52.970 align:middle line:90%
the pineal gland is located.

00:12:52.970 --> 00:12:56.180 align:middle line:84%
This is the seat
of our intuition,

00:12:56.180 --> 00:12:59.680 align:middle line:84%
and even some say
the seat of our soul.

00:12:59.680 --> 00:13:03.460 align:middle line:84%
This is the energy center that
is most known for being equated

00:13:03.460 --> 00:13:07.240 align:middle line:84%
with our psychic abilities,
and it's done mainly

00:13:07.240 --> 00:13:10.510 align:middle line:84%
through our
clairvoyance, our ability

00:13:10.510 --> 00:13:13.270 align:middle line:84%
to perceive beyond
the physical realm

00:13:13.270 --> 00:13:19.090 align:middle line:84%
and into the metaphysical realm,
and even the non-physical realm.

00:13:19.090 --> 00:13:24.700 align:middle line:84%
So what we're able to do here is
really hone in on our intuition.

00:13:24.700 --> 00:13:28.210 align:middle line:84%
The third eye chakra
Sanskrit name, Ajna chakra,

00:13:28.210 --> 00:13:31.060 align:middle line:84%
means to command,
because this is

00:13:31.060 --> 00:13:33.220 align:middle line:84%
the region within
our energy field

00:13:33.220 --> 00:13:36.170 align:middle line:90%
where we awaken perspicacity.

00:13:36.170 --> 00:13:39.260 align:middle line:84%
When we say we wish to
have psychic abilities,

00:13:39.260 --> 00:13:43.130 align:middle line:84%
we normally are really
asking for perspicacity.

00:13:43.130 --> 00:13:47.440 align:middle line:84%
Perspicacity is the ability
to see clear distinctions

00:13:47.440 --> 00:13:52.580 align:middle line:84%
between similar things, even
down to their micro differences.

00:13:52.580 --> 00:13:56.920 align:middle line:84%
So this capacity is a
spiritual nuance in perception

00:13:56.920 --> 00:14:00.710 align:middle line:84%
that gives us command
over our perception,

00:14:00.710 --> 00:14:03.370 align:middle line:84%
and that is the dominant
function of the third eye

00:14:03.370 --> 00:14:04.340 align:middle line:90%
chakra.

00:14:04.340 --> 00:14:07.180 align:middle line:84%
It is our spiritual
sight beyond the vision

00:14:07.180 --> 00:14:09.380 align:middle line:90%
of our two physical eyes.

00:14:09.380 --> 00:14:12.880 align:middle line:84%
This chakra pierces
through all illusions

00:14:12.880 --> 00:14:16.390 align:middle line:84%
in order to perceive
what is real and true.

00:14:16.390 --> 00:14:20.410 align:middle line:10%
So the third eye either
sees or senses a phenomenon

00:14:20.410 --> 00:14:22.510 align:middle line:10%
in their true form.

00:14:22.510 --> 00:14:24.580 align:middle line:84%
Now, many times the
third eye chakra

00:14:24.580 --> 00:14:26.990 align:middle line:84%
is already open and
already activated

00:14:26.990 --> 00:14:29.950 align:middle line:84%
and we just don't realize
it because we may not

00:14:29.950 --> 00:14:34.220 align:middle line:84%
be perceiving the spiritual
realms or clairvoyant activity.

00:14:34.220 --> 00:14:39.640 align:middle line:84%
And that's fine, because third
eye activity also operates

00:14:39.640 --> 00:14:41.450 align:middle line:90%
through our mind's eye.

00:14:41.450 --> 00:14:43.670 align:middle line:84%
That's through our
imagination or what

00:14:43.670 --> 00:14:48.680 align:middle line:84%
we perceive in dream time and
even through our intuition.

00:14:48.680 --> 00:14:52.980 align:middle line:84%
So there are so many different
facets to this chakra,

00:14:52.980 --> 00:14:56.790 align:middle line:84%
and how we experience
them will not all line up,

00:14:56.790 --> 00:15:02.000 align:middle line:84%
but they will be always how we
best receive psychic information

00:15:02.000 --> 00:15:03.990 align:middle line:90%
through the third eye activity.

00:15:03.990 --> 00:15:06.190 align:middle line:84%
It's just going to be
different person to person.

00:15:06.190 --> 00:15:10.190 align:middle line:90%


00:15:10.190 --> 00:15:14.010 align:middle line:84%
And lastly, we have
the crown chakra.

00:15:14.010 --> 00:15:19.220 align:middle line:84%
This chakra is known as
the 1,000 petaled lotus,

00:15:19.220 --> 00:15:24.300 align:middle line:84%
which really just is pointing
to how it is omnidirectional.

00:15:24.300 --> 00:15:28.310 align:middle line:84%
It means it is in all
directions at all times

00:15:28.310 --> 00:15:33.290 align:middle line:84%
because it is our spiritual
link with God consciousness,

00:15:33.290 --> 00:15:36.570 align:middle line:84%
or what many of us know
as source consciousness.

00:15:36.570 --> 00:15:40.010 align:middle line:84%
Just like how the heart center
is the bridge between the higher

00:15:40.010 --> 00:15:43.910 align:middle line:84%
realms and the lower
realms, the crown chakra

00:15:43.910 --> 00:15:47.930 align:middle line:90%
is that bridge with source.

00:15:47.930 --> 00:15:51.020 align:middle line:84%
How we experience
this chakra directly

00:15:51.020 --> 00:15:54.480 align:middle line:84%
would be through
non-physical knowing,

00:15:54.480 --> 00:15:57.900 align:middle line:90%
also known as claircognizance.

00:15:57.900 --> 00:16:01.530 align:middle line:84%
That is what this energy
center represents.

00:16:01.530 --> 00:16:04.640 align:middle line:84%
It is the omnipresent
invisible knowing

00:16:04.640 --> 00:16:07.700 align:middle line:84%
from being directly connected
with our higher self

00:16:07.700 --> 00:16:09.920 align:middle line:90%
and even with source.

00:16:09.920 --> 00:16:14.370 align:middle line:84%
Because the crown chakra is our
link to source consciousness,

00:16:14.370 --> 00:16:18.540 align:middle line:84%
this is also where we
experience the most upgrades.

00:16:18.540 --> 00:16:22.370 align:middle line:84%
We usually have some
ambient energies

00:16:22.370 --> 00:16:25.200 align:middle line:84%
that we sense around
the crown center.

00:16:25.200 --> 00:16:29.000 align:middle line:84%
So this energy center
is the one that we

00:16:29.000 --> 00:16:32.610 align:middle line:84%
could look at as being
source consciousness,

00:16:32.610 --> 00:16:36.830 align:middle line:90%
but through the physical senses.

00:16:36.830 --> 00:16:40.850 align:middle line:84%
This is where we experience
our true divine nature

00:16:40.850 --> 00:16:44.280 align:middle line:84%
and our true
identity as divinity,

00:16:44.280 --> 00:16:47.540 align:middle line:84%
and how we receive information
through this center

00:16:47.540 --> 00:16:51.290 align:middle line:90%
is usually as we're in motion.

00:16:51.290 --> 00:16:55.520 align:middle line:84%
So many times we
equate crown chakra

00:16:55.520 --> 00:16:59.060 align:middle line:84%
activations or even
claircognizance

00:16:59.060 --> 00:17:04.099 align:middle line:84%
as an all-knowing ability,
when in reality, it's

00:17:04.099 --> 00:17:10.349 align:middle line:84%
an ability that gives us more
knowing when we're in motion,

00:17:10.349 --> 00:17:15.180 align:middle line:84%
when we need it, when we are
at that part of our own journey

00:17:15.180 --> 00:17:17.359 align:middle line:90%
when we're ready to receive it.

00:17:17.359 --> 00:17:19.880 align:middle line:84%
And that's what's so
important to understand

00:17:19.880 --> 00:17:21.660 align:middle line:90%
about claircognizance.

00:17:21.660 --> 00:17:24.660 align:middle line:84%
It's that instead of it
being an all-knowing,

00:17:24.660 --> 00:17:26.830 align:middle line:84%
it's more of when
we need to know.

00:17:26.830 --> 00:17:30.800 align:middle line:90%


00:17:30.800 --> 00:17:35.000 align:middle line:84%
So all of the chakras
have a distinct identity

00:17:35.000 --> 00:17:38.600 align:middle line:84%
and a distinct truth
that even represents

00:17:38.600 --> 00:17:41.840 align:middle line:84%
all of the dimensions
of our energy field

00:17:41.840 --> 00:17:45.500 align:middle line:84%
and all of the different
truths that our energy field

00:17:45.500 --> 00:17:50.210 align:middle line:84%
holds to make up
our ability to be

00:17:50.210 --> 00:17:54.350 align:middle line:84%
a physical and
spiritual identity here

00:17:54.350 --> 00:17:57.200 align:middle line:90%
in the physical realm.

00:17:57.200 --> 00:18:01.160 align:middle line:10%
How we can nurture the
development of these chakras

00:18:01.160 --> 00:18:06.110 align:middle line:10%
is first by understanding
that the lower chakras are all

00:18:06.110 --> 00:18:09.530 align:middle line:10%
going to be based off of
our emotional identity

00:18:09.530 --> 00:18:11.780 align:middle line:10%
and emotional body.

00:18:11.780 --> 00:18:17.130 align:middle line:84%
When it comes to security,
artistry, and our self-worth,

00:18:17.130 --> 00:18:19.100 align:middle line:84%
these are all themes
that are intimately

00:18:19.100 --> 00:18:21.330 align:middle line:90%
tied to our emotional body.

00:18:21.330 --> 00:18:26.700 align:middle line:84%
So how we can activate them best
is through emotional practices,

00:18:26.700 --> 00:18:29.750 align:middle line:84%
where we're able to feel
a sense of belonging

00:18:29.750 --> 00:18:33.410 align:middle line:84%
and feel a sense of
self-worth and really

00:18:33.410 --> 00:18:36.380 align:middle line:84%
understand what our
creative expression is

00:18:36.380 --> 00:18:39.950 align:middle line:84%
and who we are beyond
our sense of security.

00:18:39.950 --> 00:18:45.030 align:middle line:84%
This would best be where we
start utilizing shadow work,

00:18:45.030 --> 00:18:49.430 align:middle line:84%
even inner child work,
everything that helps us examine

00:18:49.430 --> 00:18:54.170 align:middle line:84%
where our fears are rooted from
and whatever needs to be healed

00:18:54.170 --> 00:18:57.480 align:middle line:84%
within us that we
typically don't understand,

00:18:57.480 --> 00:19:01.520 align:middle line:84%
is driving the
motivation behind our ego

00:19:01.520 --> 00:19:07.460 align:middle line:84%
and our lower frequency sense
of self and sense of identity.

00:19:07.460 --> 00:19:10.970 align:middle line:84%
All of these can really
be honed in on best

00:19:10.970 --> 00:19:14.670 align:middle line:84%
and activated through
somatic practices.

00:19:14.670 --> 00:19:19.220 align:middle line:84%
Somatic practices are always
responding and addressing

00:19:19.220 --> 00:19:22.590 align:middle line:84%
our visceral body and
our visceral tissue.

00:19:22.590 --> 00:19:26.160 align:middle line:84%
So when I'm talking specifically
about somatic practices,

00:19:26.160 --> 00:19:31.350 align:middle line:84%
I'm talking about the
nonverbal instinctual body,

00:19:31.350 --> 00:19:34.430 align:middle line:84%
the one that is
non-analytical and is more

00:19:34.430 --> 00:19:37.190 align:middle line:90%
feeling and sentient-based.

00:19:37.190 --> 00:19:41.540 align:middle line:84%
While, the higher
chakras are all more

00:19:41.540 --> 00:19:45.080 align:middle line:84%
linked with spiritual
practices, ones

00:19:45.080 --> 00:19:47.450 align:middle line:84%
that would best be
enhanced through

00:19:47.450 --> 00:19:50.630 align:middle line:84%
breathwork, through
meditation, things

00:19:50.630 --> 00:19:54.960 align:middle line:84%
that require our participation
and our discipline.

00:19:54.960 --> 00:19:58.100 align:middle line:84%
Because the higher
chakras are all

00:19:58.100 --> 00:20:01.130 align:middle line:84%
based off of our
ability to participate

00:20:01.130 --> 00:20:04.340 align:middle line:84%
in their purification
and be aware

00:20:04.340 --> 00:20:08.330 align:middle line:84%
of what we need in our
own mental landscape

00:20:08.330 --> 00:20:12.320 align:middle line:84%
and what mental projections,
concepts, and barriers

00:20:12.320 --> 00:20:15.050 align:middle line:84%
we need to dissolve
in order for these

00:20:15.050 --> 00:20:18.526 align:middle line:84%
to truly be able to activate
to their highest capacity.

00:20:18.526 --> 00:20:21.860 align:middle line:90%


00:20:21.860 --> 00:20:25.890 align:middle line:84%
Chakras function together
as an entire network.

00:20:25.890 --> 00:20:29.900 align:middle line:84%
They are our energy fields
holistic distributors of life

00:20:29.900 --> 00:20:31.520 align:middle line:90%
force and prana.

00:20:31.520 --> 00:20:34.680 align:middle line:84%
What this means is that they
are not isolated channels

00:20:34.680 --> 00:20:35.830 align:middle line:90%
of life force.

00:20:35.830 --> 00:20:38.920 align:middle line:84%
They respond and
react to one another.

00:20:38.920 --> 00:20:42.610 align:middle line:10%
If one chakra is experiencing
a certain impairment,

00:20:42.610 --> 00:20:45.780 align:middle line:10%
another chakra will start
to move out of balance

00:20:45.780 --> 00:20:47.530 align:middle line:10%
to lend its resources.

00:20:47.530 --> 00:20:49.950 align:middle line:10%
This creates a
domino effect, where

00:20:49.950 --> 00:20:54.240 align:middle line:10%
each chakra becomes directly
impacted by the other's blocks

00:20:54.240 --> 00:20:57.240 align:middle line:10%
and has to overcompensate
in some way.

00:20:57.240 --> 00:21:00.870 align:middle line:10%
How the chakras become
imbalanced by overcompensating

00:21:00.870 --> 00:21:04.920 align:middle line:10%
for one another will be
personal to each of us.

00:21:04.920 --> 00:21:07.890 align:middle line:84%
We can harmonize the
entire chakra network

00:21:07.890 --> 00:21:10.710 align:middle line:84%
through a powerful
mantra that brings them

00:21:10.710 --> 00:21:14.800 align:middle line:84%
all into alignment and with
resonance with each other,

00:21:14.800 --> 00:21:18.330 align:middle line:84%
just like a tuning fork
produces a fixed tone.

00:21:18.330 --> 00:21:36.120 align:middle line:84%
This mantra is LAM, VAM,
RAM, YAM HAM, AUM, OM.

00:21:36.120 --> 00:21:37.980 align:middle line:84%
When we say that
all together, it

00:21:37.980 --> 00:21:49.800 align:middle line:84%
goes LAM, VAM, RAM,
YAM, HAM, AUM, OM.

00:21:49.800 --> 00:21:52.350 align:middle line:84%
This mantra is a
very powerful tool

00:21:52.350 --> 00:21:56.490 align:middle line:84%
to align the entire
chakra network.

00:21:56.490 --> 00:21:59.740 align:middle line:84%
By understanding and
activating your chakras,

00:21:59.740 --> 00:22:02.250 align:middle line:84%
you tap into a
network of energy that

00:22:02.250 --> 00:22:05.880 align:middle line:84%
can propel you to new
heights of personal growth

00:22:05.880 --> 00:22:08.400 align:middle line:90%
and spiritual enlightenment.

00:22:08.400 --> 00:22:13.080 align:middle line:84%
Each chakra holds the key to
unlocking your hidden strengths

00:22:13.080 --> 00:22:18.030 align:middle line:84%
and transforming your
mind, body, and soul.

00:22:18.030 --> 00:22:20.850 align:middle line:84%
Unlock your limitless
potential and step

00:22:20.850 --> 00:22:25.530 align:middle line:84%
into the powerful, vibrant life
you were always meant to live.

00:22:25.530 --> 00:22:28.880 align:middle line:90%
