00:00:19.440 --> 00:00:22.040 align:middle line:84%
What if the key to
unlocking humanity's

00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:26.280 align:middle line:84%
next evolutionary leap
lies in the sacred union

00:00:26.280 --> 00:00:30.160 align:middle line:90%
of spirit and matter?

00:00:30.160 --> 00:00:34.080 align:middle line:84%
What if there was a way to
unite the shadow and the light

00:00:34.080 --> 00:00:41.360 align:middle line:84%
within us, the above and the
below, within and without,

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:47.680 align:middle line:84%
to embrace your divinity and
experience the true oneness that

00:00:47.680 --> 00:00:49.100 align:middle line:90%
unites us all?

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:54.120 align:middle line:90%


00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:56.280 align:middle line:10%
Whether we are aware
of this or not,

00:00:56.280 --> 00:01:00.210 align:middle line:10%
we are always seeking
whatever we think will make us

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:04.090 align:middle line:10%
whole, whatever will
make us one with source.

00:01:04.090 --> 00:01:07.890 align:middle line:10%
We yearn to be one, and
the seeking and attracting

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:12.370 align:middle line:10%
is like a magnet that
will always call us home.

00:01:12.370 --> 00:01:17.290 align:middle line:84%
But this journey to oneness
starts within our own body-mind.

00:01:17.290 --> 00:01:21.610 align:middle line:84%
Spiritual alchemy is the
transmutation of all base metals

00:01:21.610 --> 00:01:23.610 align:middle line:90%
into their highest form.

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:27.570 align:middle line:84%
What this means is that we
are transmuting anything

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:30.530 align:middle line:84%
that is unconscious
and disconnected

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:33.970 align:middle line:84%
within our own being,
into something that now we

00:01:33.970 --> 00:01:38.010 align:middle line:84%
are aware of and gets
integrated into the light

00:01:38.010 --> 00:01:40.210 align:middle line:90%
of our own consciousness.

00:01:40.210 --> 00:01:43.970 align:middle line:84%
This is where we get the
term "enlightenment" from.

00:01:43.970 --> 00:01:49.290 align:middle line:84%
So spiritual alchemy is the
process of enlightenment.

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:52.330 align:middle line:90%
It is the ascension process.

00:01:52.330 --> 00:01:55.530 align:middle line:84%
And this ascension
can only take place

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:58.580 align:middle line:90%
between us and our higher self.

00:01:58.580 --> 00:02:04.140 align:middle line:84%
It is the unification and the
embodiment of our higher self.

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:06.380 align:middle line:84%
The ancients used
the name hieros

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:11.180 align:middle line:84%
gamos to describe this
process of enlightenment.

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:14.790 align:middle line:84%
Hieros gamos is the apex
of spiritual alchemy.

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:19.620 align:middle line:90%


00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:23.380 align:middle line:10%
Throughout history and
across every culture,

00:02:23.380 --> 00:02:27.860 align:middle line:10%
This concept of hieros
gamos or divine oneness

00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:32.220 align:middle line:10%
is prevalent in every
spiritual tradition.

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:36.060 align:middle line:10%
It is depicted in Hinduism
as the Shakti, which

00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:38.980 align:middle line:10%
is the feminine
energy within us,

00:02:38.980 --> 00:02:44.300 align:middle line:10%
and the Shiva, which is the
masculine energy within us.

00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:47.620 align:middle line:84%
And then it progressed
into the Greek traditions,

00:02:47.620 --> 00:02:52.540 align:middle line:84%
which is where we originally
get the term hieros gamos from.

00:02:52.540 --> 00:02:57.350 align:middle line:84%
In esoteric psychology, hieros
gamos is called conjunction,

00:02:57.350 --> 00:02:59.990 align:middle line:84%
and is interpreted
as the individuation

00:02:59.990 --> 00:03:05.350 align:middle line:84%
process of a human psyche
to become whole and unified.

00:03:05.350 --> 00:03:08.190 align:middle line:10%
In Western esoterica,
hieros gamos

00:03:08.190 --> 00:03:10.630 align:middle line:10%
was depicted as the
chemical wedding

00:03:10.630 --> 00:03:12.870 align:middle line:10%
between the king
and the queen, which

00:03:12.870 --> 00:03:16.550 align:middle line:10%
was code word for the
soul and the spirit.

00:03:16.550 --> 00:03:19.110 align:middle line:84%
The chemical wedding
is also another name

00:03:19.110 --> 00:03:22.670 align:middle line:84%
for the inner alchemy happening
within the brain, which

00:03:22.670 --> 00:03:26.070 align:middle line:84%
is the process we explored
earlier this season,

00:03:26.070 --> 00:03:28.590 align:middle line:84%
known as the sacred
secretion, where

00:03:28.590 --> 00:03:33.470 align:middle line:84%
the pineal and pituitary glands
secrete the milk and honey

00:03:33.470 --> 00:03:36.630 align:middle line:84%
to activate our
ascension and awaken

00:03:36.630 --> 00:03:39.550 align:middle line:90%
our divine connection within.

00:03:39.550 --> 00:03:44.670 align:middle line:84%
So the sacred secretion is also
a part of spiritual alchemy.

00:03:44.670 --> 00:03:48.260 align:middle line:84%
It is the process of the
embodiment of our higher self.

00:03:48.260 --> 00:03:52.750 align:middle line:90%


00:03:52.750 --> 00:03:58.360 align:middle line:84%
The human form is the microcosm
of the whole universe.

00:03:58.360 --> 00:04:02.440 align:middle line:84%
So we are the microcosm
of the entire macrocosm.

00:04:02.440 --> 00:04:04.660 align:middle line:84%
And this is very
important to understand,

00:04:04.660 --> 00:04:08.080 align:middle line:84%
because we contain all
of the elements that

00:04:08.080 --> 00:04:10.800 align:middle line:90%
make up the macrocosm.

00:04:10.800 --> 00:04:14.880 align:middle line:84%
We have fundamentally
within each person all

00:04:14.880 --> 00:04:19.720 align:middle line:84%
of the macrocosm's elementals,
all of their archetypes,

00:04:19.720 --> 00:04:23.680 align:middle line:84%
all of their stardust, is
personified and animated

00:04:23.680 --> 00:04:25.800 align:middle line:90%
through the human form.

00:04:25.800 --> 00:04:28.400 align:middle line:10%
So because of that,
each human being

00:04:28.400 --> 00:04:33.560 align:middle line:10%
is comprised of both masculine
and yang energy, as well as

00:04:33.560 --> 00:04:36.520 align:middle line:10%
feminine and yin energy.

00:04:36.520 --> 00:04:41.280 align:middle line:84%
A very basic example of
this will be breathing.

00:04:41.280 --> 00:04:47.040 align:middle line:84%
When we breathe, we are
exhaling and inhaling, which

00:04:47.040 --> 00:04:51.120 align:middle line:90%
is both yang and yin energies.

00:04:51.120 --> 00:04:56.530 align:middle line:84%
It is both masculine to
breathe and it is feminine.

00:04:56.530 --> 00:05:00.370 align:middle line:84%
It is masculine for the
reason that yang energy is one

00:05:00.370 --> 00:05:02.970 align:middle line:90%
that protrudes outward.

00:05:02.970 --> 00:05:09.330 align:middle line:10%
So yang energy is one that
moves and extends externally,

00:05:09.330 --> 00:05:14.450 align:middle line:10%
while yin energy is
receptive and pulls inward.

00:05:14.450 --> 00:05:17.130 align:middle line:84%
So even just the
act of breathing

00:05:17.130 --> 00:05:25.290 align:middle line:84%
is an example how the human form
is a microcosm of the macrocosm.

00:05:25.290 --> 00:05:28.690 align:middle line:84%
So hieros gamos has
two stages to it.

00:05:28.690 --> 00:05:31.850 align:middle line:84%
The first takes place
on the horizontal plane

00:05:31.850 --> 00:05:34.450 align:middle line:84%
of our own
consciousness, and this

00:05:34.450 --> 00:05:37.890 align:middle line:84%
is between our
body and our mind,

00:05:37.890 --> 00:05:41.090 align:middle line:84%
also known as the
mind and the heart.

00:05:41.090 --> 00:05:45.610 align:middle line:84%
It is within our own masculine
and feminine hemispheres.

00:05:45.610 --> 00:05:49.330 align:middle line:84%
This is the harmony of
our unconscious, creative,

00:05:49.330 --> 00:05:54.060 align:middle line:84%
psychic, and receptive
aspects of self, represented

00:05:54.060 --> 00:05:58.940 align:middle line:84%
as the moon, brought into
equilibrium with our conscious,

00:05:58.940 --> 00:06:03.460 align:middle line:84%
active, discerning, and
objective aspects represented

00:06:03.460 --> 00:06:05.140 align:middle line:90%
by the sun.

00:06:05.140 --> 00:06:11.780 align:middle line:84%
Once we have integrated enough
of these dualistic bodies,

00:06:11.780 --> 00:06:14.780 align:middle line:84%
now we're able to
open up enough space

00:06:14.780 --> 00:06:19.660 align:middle line:84%
within the mind and the
heart for the second step

00:06:19.660 --> 00:06:22.220 align:middle line:84%
of hieros gamos,
which takes place

00:06:22.220 --> 00:06:26.900 align:middle line:84%
on the vertical plane of
our own consciousness.

00:06:26.900 --> 00:06:30.700 align:middle line:10%
This is now the
union between the ego

00:06:30.700 --> 00:06:36.260 align:middle line:10%
and the higher self, the
physical vessel and divinity.

00:06:36.260 --> 00:06:40.100 align:middle line:84%
So this is now, once again, a
union and a sacred marriage,

00:06:40.100 --> 00:06:42.190 align:middle line:84%
but it's taking place
with our higher self.

00:06:42.190 --> 00:06:46.940 align:middle line:90%


00:06:46.940 --> 00:06:49.220 align:middle line:10%
This whole process
of hieros gamos

00:06:49.220 --> 00:06:52.270 align:middle line:10%
is depicted in the
tarot card the magician

00:06:52.270 --> 00:06:58.310 align:middle line:10%
through the symbolism of him
raising one hand towards spirit

00:06:58.310 --> 00:07:03.670 align:middle line:10%
or upward, and the other hand
towards the table and the below.

00:07:03.670 --> 00:07:07.390 align:middle line:84%
On that table, there
are four elements there.

00:07:07.390 --> 00:07:12.070 align:middle line:84%
Those elements represent
earth, air, fire, and water.

00:07:12.070 --> 00:07:16.430 align:middle line:84%
What the magician is
doing is transmuting them.

00:07:16.430 --> 00:07:20.070 align:middle line:10%
He is pointing to the below
with his hand to the sky

00:07:20.070 --> 00:07:24.150 align:middle line:10%
because he's referring
to as above, so below.

00:07:24.150 --> 00:07:29.270 align:middle line:84%
And this internal alchemy
is one of a rectification.

00:07:29.270 --> 00:07:32.830 align:middle line:84%
The magician is the
archetype that hieros gamos

00:07:32.830 --> 00:07:36.310 align:middle line:84%
is completed through, because
the magician is the one that

00:07:36.310 --> 00:07:40.670 align:middle line:84%
is combining elements that
don't fit together like air

00:07:40.670 --> 00:07:44.230 align:middle line:90%
and earth and water and fire.

00:07:44.230 --> 00:07:47.710 align:middle line:84%
What he's doing is making
them become harmonious

00:07:47.710 --> 00:07:51.400 align:middle line:84%
and even optimal in
each other's presence.

00:07:51.400 --> 00:07:57.000 align:middle line:84%
All four of these elements, our
earthly physical body, our air

00:07:57.000 --> 00:08:02.220 align:middle line:84%
and mental body, our water and
emotional body, and our fire,

00:08:02.220 --> 00:08:04.720 align:middle line:84%
which is spiritual
intelligence body.

00:08:04.720 --> 00:08:09.440 align:middle line:84%
Once they are all combined,
they create the fifth element,

00:08:09.440 --> 00:08:12.680 align:middle line:90%
which is quintessence.

00:08:12.680 --> 00:08:15.120 align:middle line:84%
Quintessence is
what we also know

00:08:15.120 --> 00:08:18.040 align:middle line:84%
as the force of
unconditional love.

00:08:18.040 --> 00:08:23.120 align:middle line:84%
It is spirit, and so
spiritual alchemy's focus

00:08:23.120 --> 00:08:26.500 align:middle line:84%
is on taking all of
the different elements,

00:08:26.500 --> 00:08:30.160 align:middle line:84%
and then purifying them
and transforming them

00:08:30.160 --> 00:08:33.960 align:middle line:84%
into a single and
purified higher

00:08:33.960 --> 00:08:37.710 align:middle line:84%
self, or a single and
purified celestial being.

00:08:37.710 --> 00:08:41.799 align:middle line:90%


00:08:41.799 --> 00:08:44.600 align:middle line:84%
Within the spirit
of every age, there

00:08:44.600 --> 00:08:47.760 align:middle line:84%
is a specific
evolutionary process

00:08:47.760 --> 00:08:52.570 align:middle line:84%
that we are meant to embody
and to learn so that we

00:08:52.570 --> 00:08:55.170 align:middle line:90%
can progress to the next age.

00:08:55.170 --> 00:08:58.450 align:middle line:84%
This is how spiritual
evolution takes place.

00:08:58.450 --> 00:09:00.730 align:middle line:84%
So when it comes to
the spirit of our age

00:09:00.730 --> 00:09:03.370 align:middle line:84%
and what we are meant
to learn so that we

00:09:03.370 --> 00:09:07.050 align:middle line:84%
can have our spiritual
evolution progress,

00:09:07.050 --> 00:09:09.930 align:middle line:90%
it is through hieros gamos.

00:09:09.930 --> 00:09:14.970 align:middle line:84%
Hieros gamos can also be
known as unity consciousness.

00:09:14.970 --> 00:09:18.410 align:middle line:84%
And unity consciousness
isn't just something

00:09:18.410 --> 00:09:21.130 align:middle line:84%
that we experience
in peak states.

00:09:21.130 --> 00:09:24.770 align:middle line:84%
It's something that we can
stabilize and integrate

00:09:24.770 --> 00:09:28.250 align:middle line:84%
into our waking life
and even have it be

00:09:28.250 --> 00:09:30.810 align:middle line:90%
our whole level of experience.

00:09:30.810 --> 00:09:34.690 align:middle line:84%
So unity consciousness
is the next level

00:09:34.690 --> 00:09:38.210 align:middle line:90%
of our own humanity's shift.

00:09:38.210 --> 00:09:41.370 align:middle line:84%
So as we're transitioning
from the spirit of this age

00:09:41.370 --> 00:09:43.490 align:middle line:84%
and closing out
all of the lessons

00:09:43.490 --> 00:09:46.010 align:middle line:84%
and themes within
this age, we're

00:09:46.010 --> 00:09:49.900 align:middle line:84%
going to be transitioning into
the age of Aquarius, which

00:09:49.900 --> 00:09:53.620 align:middle line:84%
operates from unity
consciousness.

00:09:53.620 --> 00:09:58.460 align:middle line:84%
So if unity consciousness is
our next evolutionary step,

00:09:58.460 --> 00:10:01.220 align:middle line:84%
then the universe
will not allow those

00:10:01.220 --> 00:10:06.860 align:middle line:84%
who do not become enlightened
and unify to progress.

00:10:06.860 --> 00:10:10.620 align:middle line:84%
So any parts of
humanity that are still

00:10:10.620 --> 00:10:15.100 align:middle line:84%
left in the lower
frequencies or in toxicity

00:10:15.100 --> 00:10:18.140 align:middle line:84%
are not going to be able to
make it through the purification

00:10:18.140 --> 00:10:20.900 align:middle line:84%
process that we
are experiencing.

00:10:20.900 --> 00:10:24.100 align:middle line:84%
So the universe is
pushing us into wholeness,

00:10:24.100 --> 00:10:27.540 align:middle line:84%
and it's done through this
alchemical purification process

00:10:27.540 --> 00:10:28.840 align:middle line:90%
that we're currently in.

00:10:28.840 --> 00:10:32.620 align:middle line:90%


00:10:32.620 --> 00:10:36.900 align:middle line:84%
What is unconscious within
all of us will be different.

00:10:36.900 --> 00:10:39.500 align:middle line:84%
Some of us may be
very comfortable

00:10:39.500 --> 00:10:42.380 align:middle line:84%
with our emotional
body, and some of us

00:10:42.380 --> 00:10:45.700 align:middle line:84%
may be very comfortable
with our mental body.

00:10:45.700 --> 00:10:48.470 align:middle line:84%
And we might have
areas that we call

00:10:48.470 --> 00:10:53.750 align:middle line:84%
blind spots, where we don't
know how to integrate something.

00:10:53.750 --> 00:10:56.950 align:middle line:84%
We may not be great about
honoring our emotions

00:10:56.950 --> 00:10:59.630 align:middle line:84%
and knowing how important
the information that's

00:10:59.630 --> 00:11:01.590 align:middle line:90%
held within them is.

00:11:01.590 --> 00:11:03.470 align:middle line:84%
And so that would
be something that

00:11:03.470 --> 00:11:07.190 align:middle line:84%
is unconscious and disconnected
within our own being.

00:11:07.190 --> 00:11:10.390 align:middle line:84%
That would be the element
of water and earth

00:11:10.390 --> 00:11:13.470 align:middle line:84%
that then need to
become purified

00:11:13.470 --> 00:11:16.150 align:middle line:84%
through our own conscious
awareness of them

00:11:16.150 --> 00:11:19.590 align:middle line:84%
and through our own
embracing of them.

00:11:19.590 --> 00:11:23.710 align:middle line:84%
And it's through that embracing
and integration process

00:11:23.710 --> 00:11:28.430 align:middle line:84%
of whatever is in us that we
feel disconnected from that

00:11:28.430 --> 00:11:32.270 align:middle line:84%
becomes something
that now is embodied

00:11:32.270 --> 00:11:36.190 align:middle line:84%
and aware of and
now conscious of.

00:11:36.190 --> 00:11:38.590 align:middle line:84%
So this whole process
of hieros gamos

00:11:38.590 --> 00:11:43.710 align:middle line:84%
is meant to make us conscious of
all of the different dimensions

00:11:43.710 --> 00:11:46.840 align:middle line:84%
within us and make them
work together in a way

00:11:46.840 --> 00:11:49.400 align:middle line:90%
that they're coherent.

00:11:49.400 --> 00:11:53.320 align:middle line:84%
In truth, there can be
no health within a being

00:11:53.320 --> 00:11:57.520 align:middle line:84%
unless there is this
equilibrium between our left

00:11:57.520 --> 00:11:59.440 align:middle line:90%
and right hemispheres.

00:11:59.440 --> 00:12:02.520 align:middle line:84%
Because what you will find
is that anywhere where

00:12:02.520 --> 00:12:05.640 align:middle line:84%
we're imbalanced
or polarized, it's

00:12:05.640 --> 00:12:08.040 align:middle line:84%
going to produce
something that ends up

00:12:08.040 --> 00:12:10.360 align:middle line:90%
becoming a part of our shadow.

00:12:10.360 --> 00:12:13.600 align:middle line:84%
And the shadow isn't
a bad guy, but it's

00:12:13.600 --> 00:12:15.760 align:middle line:84%
something that
represents something

00:12:15.760 --> 00:12:19.520 align:middle line:84%
that we're disconnected from
within our own consciousness.

00:12:19.520 --> 00:12:23.520 align:middle line:84%
So anytime there's an
imbalance within our own psyche

00:12:23.520 --> 00:12:26.800 align:middle line:84%
and an imbalance between
the body and the mind,

00:12:26.800 --> 00:12:29.860 align:middle line:84%
there's going to have
some form of discord,

00:12:29.860 --> 00:12:34.920 align:middle line:84%
some form of internal conflict
that produces unhealth and even

00:12:34.920 --> 00:12:37.440 align:middle line:90%
toxicity within our being.

00:12:37.440 --> 00:12:43.120 align:middle line:84%
So equilibrium is not meant to
mean that we all act the same

00:12:43.120 --> 00:12:45.330 align:middle line:90%
and we are all the same.

00:12:45.330 --> 00:12:48.170 align:middle line:84%
In fact, equilibrium
simply means

00:12:48.170 --> 00:12:52.290 align:middle line:84%
that we are all
allowing each part

00:12:52.290 --> 00:12:54.770 align:middle line:84%
of our own psyche
and each element

00:12:54.770 --> 00:12:58.330 align:middle line:90%
within us to fully be embraced.

00:12:58.330 --> 00:13:01.970 align:middle line:84%
So this isn't going to
look the same for everyone.

00:13:01.970 --> 00:13:06.290 align:middle line:84%
In fact, this process will be
something that always brings us

00:13:06.290 --> 00:13:08.970 align:middle line:84%
into our own personal
health, but we're still

00:13:08.970 --> 00:13:13.690 align:middle line:84%
going to maintain our own
unique aspect of source.

00:13:13.690 --> 00:13:17.250 align:middle line:84%
So we're always going to
still maintain our uniqueness.

00:13:17.250 --> 00:13:19.120 align:middle line:84%
It's just going to
be in a healthy form.

00:13:19.120 --> 00:13:23.650 align:middle line:90%


00:13:23.650 --> 00:13:28.390 align:middle line:84%
The human condition has so
many different states to it,

00:13:28.390 --> 00:13:33.290 align:middle line:84%
and the more that we evolve
epoch by epoch, age by age,

00:13:33.290 --> 00:13:37.530 align:middle line:84%
not only does it look different,
it comes with new abilities.

00:13:37.530 --> 00:13:42.730 align:middle line:84%
So unity consciousness and the
higher timelines for humanity

00:13:42.730 --> 00:13:46.140 align:middle line:84%
don't look exactly the
same as our human form

00:13:46.140 --> 00:13:48.660 align:middle line:90%
and our current human condition.

00:13:48.660 --> 00:13:51.900 align:middle line:84%
What we can expect when
we progress and evolve

00:13:51.900 --> 00:13:54.340 align:middle line:84%
to the higher
timelines for humanity

00:13:54.340 --> 00:13:59.620 align:middle line:84%
is now hieros gamos allows
us the communication

00:13:59.620 --> 00:14:03.640 align:middle line:84%
that we wish to receive from
not just psychic abilities,

00:14:03.640 --> 00:14:08.340 align:middle line:84%
but also what Vedic
terminology knew as siddhis.

00:14:08.340 --> 00:14:10.780 align:middle line:84%
Siddhis are supernatural
powers that we

00:14:10.780 --> 00:14:13.980 align:middle line:84%
attain in advanced
states of consciousness.

00:14:13.980 --> 00:14:16.500 align:middle line:84%
Each siddhi is a
specific ability

00:14:16.500 --> 00:14:19.900 align:middle line:84%
that appears magical to
us, because in some way

00:14:19.900 --> 00:14:23.660 align:middle line:84%
it defies the current laws
and rules of this reality,

00:14:23.660 --> 00:14:28.380 align:middle line:84%
like effortless manifestation,
astral projection,

00:14:28.380 --> 00:14:30.500 align:middle line:90%
and bi-locating.

00:14:30.500 --> 00:14:33.300 align:middle line:84%
But out of all of the many
supernatural abilities,

00:14:33.300 --> 00:14:37.260 align:middle line:84%
the most common are an innate
knowing and understanding

00:14:37.260 --> 00:14:40.380 align:middle line:84%
of the universe, as
well as precognition

00:14:40.380 --> 00:14:44.370 align:middle line:84%
of the future,
telepathy, premonitions,

00:14:44.370 --> 00:14:45.660 align:middle line:90%
and remembering past lives.

00:14:45.660 --> 00:14:48.790 align:middle line:90%


00:14:48.790 --> 00:14:53.470 align:middle line:84%
So spiritual alchemy is the
unification and the coherency

00:14:53.470 --> 00:14:56.470 align:middle line:84%
created within our
own consciousness

00:14:56.470 --> 00:14:58.630 align:middle line:90%
and within our own being.

00:14:58.630 --> 00:15:04.030 align:middle line:84%
Then false alchemy would be the
separation and the disconnection

00:15:04.030 --> 00:15:08.550 align:middle line:84%
of our own aspects of our
psyche and our own aspects

00:15:08.550 --> 00:15:10.190 align:middle line:90%
of consciousness.

00:15:10.190 --> 00:15:15.670 align:middle line:84%
False alchemy is the misuse of
alchemical principles in pursuit

00:15:15.670 --> 00:15:20.910 align:middle line:84%
of material gain, while ignoring
the deeper spiritual purpose

00:15:20.910 --> 00:15:23.470 align:middle line:90%
of transformation.

00:15:23.470 --> 00:15:28.510 align:middle line:84%
It's when we are polarized into
one aspect or only one part

00:15:28.510 --> 00:15:31.390 align:middle line:90%
and dimension of our own being.

00:15:31.390 --> 00:15:35.270 align:middle line:84%
So polarization
is naturally going

00:15:35.270 --> 00:15:39.590 align:middle line:84%
to lead to some imbalance
that becomes toxic.

00:15:39.590 --> 00:15:42.320 align:middle line:84%
And the main issue
with false alchemy

00:15:42.320 --> 00:15:45.840 align:middle line:84%
is that it leads to
degenerative timelines.

00:15:45.840 --> 00:15:49.880 align:middle line:84%
So if the rite of passage
and the spiritual initiation

00:15:49.880 --> 00:15:53.920 align:middle line:84%
for this age is
unity consciousness,

00:15:53.920 --> 00:15:55.640 align:middle line:84%
that's naturally
going to lead us

00:15:55.640 --> 00:16:00.040 align:middle line:84%
on a trajectory towards what we
would consider optimal timelines

00:16:00.040 --> 00:16:04.520 align:middle line:84%
or timelines that move forward
and progress in their evolution.

00:16:04.520 --> 00:16:07.120 align:middle line:10%
And whenever we
see something that

00:16:07.120 --> 00:16:11.320 align:middle line:10%
has a forward motion
and a positive timeline,

00:16:11.320 --> 00:16:14.560 align:middle line:10%
we will also see
its inverted form,

00:16:14.560 --> 00:16:17.120 align:middle line:10%
and that is the lower timelines.

00:16:17.120 --> 00:16:21.680 align:middle line:84%
So these are ones that all
reflect our psyche when

00:16:21.680 --> 00:16:24.480 align:middle line:90%
it is completely unintegrated.

00:16:24.480 --> 00:16:28.080 align:middle line:84%
And that is what false
alchemy really leads to.

00:16:28.080 --> 00:16:31.400 align:middle line:84%
Essentially, the higher
timelines for humanity

00:16:31.400 --> 00:16:35.080 align:middle line:84%
are ones based off of
our internal harmony.

00:16:35.080 --> 00:16:37.760 align:middle line:84%
And the lower
timelines for humanity

00:16:37.760 --> 00:16:43.290 align:middle line:84%
are reflections and rooted in
our disharmony or disunity.

00:16:43.290 --> 00:16:46.090 align:middle line:84%
This can even progress
deeper and deeper

00:16:46.090 --> 00:16:48.610 align:middle line:90%
into levels of narcissism.

00:16:48.610 --> 00:16:53.210 align:middle line:84%
Narcissism is the inversion
of unity consciousness.

00:16:53.210 --> 00:16:56.170 align:middle line:84%
So whereas with
individuation, we

00:16:56.170 --> 00:17:01.970 align:middle line:84%
have the positive reflection of
having a single unified being,

00:17:01.970 --> 00:17:05.450 align:middle line:84%
narcissism would be
when we are in denial

00:17:05.450 --> 00:17:11.170 align:middle line:84%
of all of our internal parts,
and therefore, we deny others.

00:17:11.170 --> 00:17:14.650 align:middle line:84%
We deny them to the point
where now we are blocked off

00:17:14.650 --> 00:17:16.970 align:middle line:90%
from any higher awareness.

00:17:16.970 --> 00:17:21.450 align:middle line:84%
So narcissism in itself is
a deeply low frequency state

00:17:21.450 --> 00:17:22.450 align:middle line:90%
of being.

00:17:22.450 --> 00:17:26.130 align:middle line:84%
It's one where we carry
out our whole existence

00:17:26.130 --> 00:17:30.170 align:middle line:84%
through the egoic mind,
whereas a being who

00:17:30.170 --> 00:17:34.010 align:middle line:84%
has gone through the spiritual
alchemy of hieros gamos

00:17:34.010 --> 00:17:36.770 align:middle line:84%
has attained unity
consciousness.

00:17:36.770 --> 00:17:39.660 align:middle line:84%
And that is one where
we see ourselves

00:17:39.660 --> 00:17:42.780 align:middle line:90%
and our external reality as one.

00:17:42.780 --> 00:17:45.500 align:middle line:84%
So we see the world
and all other beings

00:17:45.500 --> 00:17:48.960 align:middle line:84%
as being a part of us and a
part of our consciousness.

00:17:48.960 --> 00:17:53.740 align:middle line:90%


00:17:53.740 --> 00:17:57.500 align:middle line:84%
The best way that we can start
applying this sacred union

00:17:57.500 --> 00:18:02.740 align:middle line:84%
within our own body-mind is
by honoring and discovering

00:18:02.740 --> 00:18:05.460 align:middle line:84%
all different
elements within us,

00:18:05.460 --> 00:18:10.340 align:middle line:84%
within our somatic body,
our emotional body,

00:18:10.340 --> 00:18:14.300 align:middle line:84%
and then our logical
and analytical body.

00:18:14.300 --> 00:18:19.380 align:middle line:84%
When we honor all of these
different facets of ourself,

00:18:19.380 --> 00:18:22.780 align:middle line:84%
and we're able to make
them aware of one another

00:18:22.780 --> 00:18:25.860 align:middle line:84%
so that they're working
together and in harmony

00:18:25.860 --> 00:18:29.980 align:middle line:84%
rather than in disharmony and
in conflict with one another,

00:18:29.980 --> 00:18:33.860 align:middle line:84%
now we're not in denial
of any part of our being,

00:18:33.860 --> 00:18:36.540 align:middle line:84%
and that's at the core
of spiritual alchemy.

00:18:36.540 --> 00:18:39.910 align:middle line:84%
It's really about
being able to embrace

00:18:39.910 --> 00:18:45.070 align:middle line:84%
all aspects and all dimensions
of our consciousness.

00:18:45.070 --> 00:18:47.750 align:middle line:84%
Hieros gamos is the
transformative force

00:18:47.750 --> 00:18:53.030 align:middle line:84%
that allows us to merge our
inner opposites, unlocking

00:18:53.030 --> 00:18:57.390 align:middle line:84%
the divine potential within,
and elevating us into higher

00:18:57.390 --> 00:18:59.750 align:middle line:90%
realms of consciousness.

00:18:59.750 --> 00:19:02.670 align:middle line:84%
By mastering this
alchemical process,

00:19:02.670 --> 00:19:07.870 align:middle line:84%
we become conscious creators of
a unified reality, transcending

00:19:07.870 --> 00:19:10.630 align:middle line:90%
separation and ego.

00:19:10.630 --> 00:19:12.190 align:middle line:90%
The choice is yours.

00:19:12.190 --> 00:19:16.110 align:middle line:84%
Will you remain stuck in the
old paradigm of separation?

00:19:16.110 --> 00:19:19.990 align:middle line:84%
Or embody this sacred
union of hieros gamos

00:19:19.990 --> 00:19:21.810 align:middle line:90%
and ascend with humanity?

00:19:21.810 --> 00:19:25.790 align:middle line:90%


00:19:25.790 --> 00:19:27.750 align:middle line:84%
Throughout this
journey, we've seen

00:19:27.750 --> 00:19:31.230 align:middle line:84%
that the power to shape
your reality ultimately

00:19:31.230 --> 00:19:33.710 align:middle line:90%
lies with you.

00:19:33.710 --> 00:19:36.080 align:middle line:84%
From understanding
the hidden forces that

00:19:36.080 --> 00:19:38.920 align:middle line:84%
influence your
choices to mastering

00:19:38.920 --> 00:19:42.400 align:middle line:84%
the art of spiritual
sovereignty by awakening

00:19:42.400 --> 00:19:45.880 align:middle line:84%
to the subtle energies
of your chakras,

00:19:45.880 --> 00:19:50.080 align:middle line:84%
embracing alchemical
practices like hieros gamos,

00:19:50.080 --> 00:19:52.560 align:middle line:84%
and reclaiming
your free will, you

00:19:52.560 --> 00:19:56.480 align:middle line:84%
step into the creator
seat of your life.

00:19:56.480 --> 00:19:59.800 align:middle line:84%
The timeline you choose
isn't predetermined.

00:19:59.800 --> 00:20:04.440 align:middle line:84%
It's crafted with every
conscious decision you make.

00:20:04.440 --> 00:20:09.440 align:middle line:84%
The power to create,
