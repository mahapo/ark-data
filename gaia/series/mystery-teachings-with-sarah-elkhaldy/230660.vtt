>> I'm Sarah Elkhaldy.

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:12.750 align:middle line:90%

[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:20.540 align:middle line:84%
What if the reality
you experience

00:00:20.540 --> 00:00:23.330 align:middle line:90%
isn't as free as you think?

00:00:23.330 --> 00:00:26.720 align:middle line:84%
Through subtle manipulation
and the unseen force

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:29.300 align:middle line:84%
of predictive
programming, we are often

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:33.350 align:middle line:90%
led into predetermined futures.

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:38.420 align:middle line:84%
But what happens when we reclaim
our power to create a new path?

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:41.690 align:middle line:84%
How can we break free from
these forces that shape

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:43.195 align:middle line:90%
our lives without our consent?

00:00:43.195 --> 00:00:45.800 align:middle line:90%


00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:50.060 align:middle line:10%
So much of the events that take
place within our larger reality

00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:53.210 align:middle line:10%
are actually
different mechanisms

00:00:53.210 --> 00:00:56.540 align:middle line:10%
that are used by the
powers that were in order

00:00:56.540 --> 00:01:01.920 align:middle line:10%
to incur our own free will and
our own consent so that they

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:08.010 align:middle line:10%
can actually use it for
their own manifestations.

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:10.290 align:middle line:10%
When these events
that are taking place

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:13.000 align:middle line:10%
at a collective
level are happening,

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:18.100 align:middle line:10%
it's actually a very occulted
method of mind control.

00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:24.750 align:middle line:84%
And it's specific occult name is
called revelation of the method.

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:28.500 align:middle line:84%
And what specifically
revelation of the method is,

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:33.990 align:middle line:84%
is when the powers that were
and the matrix control system

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:38.520 align:middle line:84%
is trying to get our
consent in order for them

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:42.120 align:middle line:84%
to be able to create dark and
negative timelines for all

00:01:42.120 --> 00:01:43.086 align:middle line:90%
to experience.

00:01:43.086 --> 00:01:46.500 align:middle line:90%


00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:48.990 align:middle line:84%
Revelation of the
method operates

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:51.840 align:middle line:84%
through trauma-based
mind control.

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:55.410 align:middle line:84%
So in trauma-based mind
control, what's taking

00:01:55.410 --> 00:01:58.620 align:middle line:84%
place is that there's a
collective programming

00:01:58.620 --> 00:02:03.880 align:middle line:84%
of our belief systems through
disempowering imagery,

00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:06.570 align:middle line:84%
through very shocking
and very scary

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:10.740 align:middle line:84%
narratives that are being
flooded through all of the news

00:02:10.740 --> 00:02:12.540 align:middle line:90%
outlets.

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:17.070 align:middle line:84%
When this happens, it's
done intentionally.

00:02:17.070 --> 00:02:21.870 align:middle line:84%
It is to traumatize us
out of our neocortex.

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:24.570 align:middle line:84%
The reason why is
because the neocortex

00:02:24.570 --> 00:02:29.370 align:middle line:90%
is where we are in our power.

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:33.400 align:middle line:84%
It is a higher-order thinking,
higher-order reasoning.

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:36.990 align:middle line:84%
It is where we can ration
and even be creative.

00:02:36.990 --> 00:02:41.340 align:middle line:84%
So it takes us out of
our creator being power.

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:43.230 align:middle line:84%
That's what's most
important to understand

00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:45.100 align:middle line:90%
about trauma-based mind control.

00:02:45.100 --> 00:02:49.260 align:middle line:84%
It is trying to knock us
out of our higher reasoning

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:52.840 align:middle line:84%
so that we get placed lower
into the reptilian brain.

00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:55.890 align:middle line:84%
When we are operating
from the reptilian brain,

00:02:55.890 --> 00:02:58.090 align:middle line:90%
now we can be controlled.

00:02:58.090 --> 00:03:02.110 align:middle line:84%
Now we give away our
consent because we

00:03:02.110 --> 00:03:06.800 align:middle line:84%
are knocked out of the adult.
The adult is the neocortex.

00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:10.880 align:middle line:84%
And once we no longer feel
like we can truly be sovereign,

00:03:10.880 --> 00:03:15.100 align:middle line:84%
we have paralyzed
our own vibration.

00:03:15.100 --> 00:03:17.860 align:middle line:84%
And the vibration
drops deeper and deeper

00:03:17.860 --> 00:03:22.960 align:middle line:84%
into now it is so fear
based that it relinquishes

00:03:22.960 --> 00:03:24.380 align:middle line:90%
its own power.

00:03:24.380 --> 00:03:27.010 align:middle line:84%
Not only do we
relinquish our own power

00:03:27.010 --> 00:03:29.750 align:middle line:84%
when we're operating
from the reptilian brain,

00:03:29.750 --> 00:03:31.580 align:middle line:90%
we do so happily.

00:03:31.580 --> 00:03:35.270 align:middle line:84%
We do so with the sense and
the vibration of relief.

00:03:35.270 --> 00:03:38.950 align:middle line:84%
Because we have been so
scared out of our power

00:03:38.950 --> 00:03:44.560 align:middle line:84%
that then we don't know what to
do with it, so we give it away.

00:03:44.560 --> 00:03:46.840 align:middle line:84%
And that's what
revelation of the method

00:03:46.840 --> 00:03:48.590 align:middle line:90%
is all designed to do.

00:03:48.590 --> 00:03:53.290 align:middle line:84%
It is designed to have us
feel relief at relinquishing

00:03:53.290 --> 00:03:56.800 align:middle line:90%
our own creator being power.

00:03:56.800 --> 00:03:59.890 align:middle line:84%
So revelation of the
method operates strongest

00:03:59.890 --> 00:04:02.830 align:middle line:90%
through repetition and shock.

00:04:02.830 --> 00:04:05.080 align:middle line:84%
And that's because when
we are repetitively

00:04:05.080 --> 00:04:10.880 align:middle line:84%
shown shocking imagery, this
prepares our subconscious.

00:04:10.880 --> 00:04:15.189 align:middle line:10%
And our subconscious is the
motherboard of our whole energy

00:04:15.189 --> 00:04:15.989 align:middle line:10%
field.

00:04:15.989 --> 00:04:18.670 align:middle line:90%


00:04:18.670 --> 00:04:23.110 align:middle line:84%
We're typically only aware
of a very small fraction

00:04:23.110 --> 00:04:25.000 align:middle line:90%
of the beliefs we hold.

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:29.890 align:middle line:84%
But the subconscious mind
holds so much content within it

00:04:29.890 --> 00:04:32.290 align:middle line:84%
that we could
actually not even be

00:04:32.290 --> 00:04:35.470 align:middle line:84%
aware of the limitations
and the beliefs that are

00:04:35.470 --> 00:04:37.096 align:middle line:90%
held within the subconscious.

00:04:37.096 --> 00:04:39.970 align:middle line:90%


00:04:39.970 --> 00:04:42.460 align:middle line:84%
So the subconscious
mind is really

00:04:42.460 --> 00:04:46.580 align:middle line:84%
where our creative essence and
our creative power comes from.

00:04:46.580 --> 00:04:49.930 align:middle line:84%
And the conscious mind
is the interpreter

00:04:49.930 --> 00:04:53.620 align:middle line:84%
and the translator of
that creative power

00:04:53.620 --> 00:04:57.100 align:middle line:90%
within the subconscious.

00:04:57.100 --> 00:05:00.490 align:middle line:84%
When predictive
programming is constantly

00:05:00.490 --> 00:05:04.130 align:middle line:84%
trying to repeat and shock
us into trauma-based mind

00:05:04.130 --> 00:05:07.430 align:middle line:84%
control, what this
does is not just

00:05:07.430 --> 00:05:12.590 align:middle line:84%
affect our ability to
create, it deeply shuts down

00:05:12.590 --> 00:05:14.100 align:middle line:90%
our creative vision.

00:05:14.100 --> 00:05:18.260 align:middle line:84%
This is what's called
paradigm blindness.

00:05:18.260 --> 00:05:22.670 align:middle line:84%
Paradigm blindness is when
we can't see more empowering

00:05:22.670 --> 00:05:23.550 align:middle line:90%
timelines.

00:05:23.550 --> 00:05:27.470 align:middle line:84%
And we can't see a
more prosperous world

00:05:27.470 --> 00:05:29.550 align:middle line:90%
because we are blind to it.

00:05:29.550 --> 00:05:34.250 align:middle line:84%
We simply cannot access that
paradigm because we've become

00:05:34.250 --> 00:05:39.320 align:middle line:84%
so desensitized to the
predictive programming that is

00:05:39.320 --> 00:05:44.900 align:middle line:84%
constantly being infused inside
our mind and infused inside

00:05:44.900 --> 00:05:46.740 align:middle line:90%
the collective consciousness.

00:05:46.740 --> 00:05:50.300 align:middle line:90%


00:05:50.300 --> 00:05:52.370 align:middle line:84%
So the subconscious
is really what's

00:05:52.370 --> 00:05:55.200 align:middle line:84%
being targeted through
revelation of the method.

00:05:55.200 --> 00:05:58.670 align:middle line:84%
And it's done through
large media outlets

00:05:58.670 --> 00:06:03.510 align:middle line:84%
and large platforms
that are all trying

00:06:03.510 --> 00:06:08.170 align:middle line:84%
to repeat a certain narrative
to prepare us for it.

00:06:08.170 --> 00:06:11.820 align:middle line:84%
And it's even more than
just repeating a narrative.

00:06:11.820 --> 00:06:15.600 align:middle line:84%
In fact, it could even
be some public figures

00:06:15.600 --> 00:06:20.230 align:middle line:84%
that we see telling us exactly
what they are going to do.

00:06:20.230 --> 00:06:23.650 align:middle line:84%
As long as it is revealed
in whatever manner,

00:06:23.650 --> 00:06:27.090 align:middle line:84%
then it doesn't
matter the method

00:06:27.090 --> 00:06:29.080 align:middle line:84%
And the reason why
this is so important,

00:06:29.080 --> 00:06:32.340 align:middle line:84%
that public figures
step on large platforms

00:06:32.340 --> 00:06:35.170 align:middle line:84%
and tell us what
they are going to do,

00:06:35.170 --> 00:06:38.850 align:middle line:84%
is because, karmically,
they view themselves

00:06:38.850 --> 00:06:40.990 align:middle line:84%
as have washing
their hands clean

00:06:40.990 --> 00:06:43.680 align:middle line:84%
because now it is
up to the public

00:06:43.680 --> 00:06:48.190 align:middle line:84%
knowing and having that reveal
to them what they will do,

00:06:48.190 --> 00:06:50.350 align:middle line:90%
what actions we will take.

00:06:50.350 --> 00:06:52.970 align:middle line:90%
And even nonaction is an action.

00:06:52.970 --> 00:06:55.890 align:middle line:90%


00:06:55.890 --> 00:06:58.530 align:middle line:84%
Now we can start
seeing how important it

00:06:58.530 --> 00:07:02.350 align:middle line:84%
is for us to be more mindful
of the media we take in,

00:07:02.350 --> 00:07:05.340 align:middle line:84%
and be far more mindful
of what exact narratives

00:07:05.340 --> 00:07:08.156 align:middle line:84%
we see always infused
within the collective.

00:07:08.156 --> 00:07:13.590 align:middle line:90%


00:07:13.590 --> 00:07:18.930 align:middle line:84%
Events can't manifest
without our consent,

00:07:18.930 --> 00:07:24.210 align:middle line:84%
even if our consent is taking
place subconsciously, and even

00:07:24.210 --> 00:07:27.450 align:middle line:90%
at an unconscious level.

00:07:27.450 --> 00:07:31.470 align:middle line:84%
What this really tells us
is that we have a lot more

00:07:31.470 --> 00:07:37.950 align:middle line:84%
say inside the creation of our
reality than we may even know.

00:07:37.950 --> 00:07:41.980 align:middle line:84%
And this is how consciousness
truly creates our reality.

00:07:41.980 --> 00:07:46.230 align:middle line:84%
It's through the aggregates
and the collective beliefs

00:07:46.230 --> 00:07:52.380 align:middle line:84%
of what we believe is true that
then get projected onto reality.

00:07:52.380 --> 00:07:55.830 align:middle line:84%
And through that
projection, our reality

00:07:55.830 --> 00:07:58.810 align:middle line:84%
then reflects those
beliefs back to us.

00:07:58.810 --> 00:08:03.570 align:middle line:84%
So can you see how, if we
have very limiting beliefs,

00:08:03.570 --> 00:08:08.920 align:middle line:84%
and if we are operating from
mostly a fear-based frequency,

00:08:08.920 --> 00:08:14.760 align:middle line:84%
then we may not even be
accessing, at all, so much

00:08:14.760 --> 00:08:18.780 align:middle line:84%
of the potential to create our
reality that our consciousness

00:08:18.780 --> 00:08:20.915 align:middle line:90%
truly has the capacity to do?

00:08:20.915 --> 00:08:27.720 align:middle line:90%


00:08:27.720 --> 00:08:32.400 align:middle line:84%
Revelation of the method is
also an indirect confession

00:08:32.400 --> 00:08:36.210 align:middle line:84%
that all beings are
sovereign, and all beings

00:08:36.210 --> 00:08:40.980 align:middle line:84%
have the responsibility
of their own free will.

00:08:40.980 --> 00:08:43.919 align:middle line:84%
From universal
consciousness, there

00:08:43.919 --> 00:08:47.520 align:middle line:84%
is no such thing as
following orders.

00:08:47.520 --> 00:08:51.250 align:middle line:84%
Even if we believe that we
were simply following orders,

00:08:51.250 --> 00:08:56.200 align:middle line:84%
or even if we believe we have
no power to take actions,

00:08:56.200 --> 00:09:00.580 align:middle line:84%
universal consciousness does
not respond to that belief.

00:09:00.580 --> 00:09:03.410 align:middle line:84%
Universal
consciousness is fixed.

00:09:03.410 --> 00:09:09.230 align:middle line:84%
It will always evenly and
equally distribute the karma

00:09:09.230 --> 00:09:11.920 align:middle line:84%
because there is no
such thing as following

00:09:11.920 --> 00:09:14.706 align:middle line:84%
orders from universal
consciousness's perception.

00:09:14.706 --> 00:09:18.460 align:middle line:90%


00:09:18.460 --> 00:09:23.890 align:middle line:84%
The second part, the stage 2
of revelation of the method,

00:09:23.890 --> 00:09:29.150 align:middle line:84%
is to get us caught in a karmic
cycle, a karmic feedback loop.

00:09:29.150 --> 00:09:33.113 align:middle line:84%
And what this feedback loop is
it's called Hegelian's dialect.

00:09:33.113 --> 00:09:36.040 align:middle line:90%


00:09:36.040 --> 00:09:39.470 align:middle line:84%
Now, a dialectic is not
negative on its own.

00:09:39.470 --> 00:09:42.350 align:middle line:84%
When we're looking at
a dialectic neutrally,

00:09:42.350 --> 00:09:47.120 align:middle line:84%
all it is, is a thesis,
and then an antithesis,

00:09:47.120 --> 00:09:53.260 align:middle line:84%
which then creates the third
force, which is a synthesis.

00:09:53.260 --> 00:09:57.500 align:middle line:84%
Dialectics can be used in a
positive or a neutral way.

00:09:57.500 --> 00:10:01.340 align:middle line:84%
They can also be used in a very
manipulative and negative way.

00:10:01.340 --> 00:10:04.390 align:middle line:84%
And this is where we
see Hegelian dialectic

00:10:04.390 --> 00:10:05.570 align:middle line:90%
used the most.

00:10:05.570 --> 00:10:09.520 align:middle line:84%
It's through the powers that
were creating a problem,

00:10:09.520 --> 00:10:13.000 align:middle line:84%
so that then they
can intentionally

00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:15.910 align:middle line:84%
create the reaction
or anticipate

00:10:15.910 --> 00:10:21.010 align:middle line:84%
what our reaction will be,
so that they can sell us

00:10:21.010 --> 00:10:22.660 align:middle line:90%
the solution.

00:10:22.660 --> 00:10:24.910 align:middle line:90%
But the problem was created.

00:10:24.910 --> 00:10:27.440 align:middle line:84%
And the reaction
was anticipated.

00:10:27.440 --> 00:10:31.220 align:middle line:84%
And the solution was
definitely preplanned.

00:10:31.220 --> 00:10:34.630 align:middle line:84%
So we get caught up in
a negative feedback loop

00:10:34.630 --> 00:10:38.180 align:middle line:90%
of problem, reaction, solution.

00:10:38.180 --> 00:10:40.930 align:middle line:84%
And this all happens
unconsciously

00:10:40.930 --> 00:10:46.270 align:middle line:84%
when we're unaware of what
revelation of the method is.

00:10:46.270 --> 00:10:52.400 align:middle line:84%
Once we start becoming
aware, we now have agency.

00:10:52.400 --> 00:10:55.010 align:middle line:90%
Agency is everything.

00:10:55.010 --> 00:10:58.730 align:middle line:84%
It is what we are being
told we don't have.

00:10:58.730 --> 00:11:02.750 align:middle line:84%
It's being told it's an
illusion, when in reality, free

00:11:02.750 --> 00:11:07.490 align:middle line:84%
will and the agency that it
brings us is how we get out

00:11:07.490 --> 00:11:11.630 align:middle line:84%
of a karmic feedback loop of
having a problem that now we

00:11:11.630 --> 00:11:14.660 align:middle line:84%
have to give out our
life force in a reaction

00:11:14.660 --> 00:11:19.580 align:middle line:84%
for, and then submit to,
powerlessly, a solution to.

00:11:19.580 --> 00:11:23.570 align:middle line:84%
This problem, reaction,
solution, karmic cycle

00:11:23.570 --> 00:11:28.100 align:middle line:84%
is all resolved through
our own free will

00:11:28.100 --> 00:11:31.225 align:middle line:84%
and through our own ability
to withdraw our consent.

00:11:31.225 --> 00:11:35.570 align:middle line:90%


00:11:35.570 --> 00:11:39.140 align:middle line:84%
So the strongest ways that
we can take back our power

00:11:39.140 --> 00:11:43.130 align:middle line:84%
and counteract all of the
revelation of the method

00:11:43.130 --> 00:11:46.260 align:middle line:84%
and predictive programming
that are taking place

00:11:46.260 --> 00:11:50.233 align:middle line:84%
is through recognizing first
that we have that agency.

00:11:50.233 --> 00:11:54.590 align:middle line:90%


00:11:54.590 --> 00:11:57.590 align:middle line:84%
Once we're able to
truly understand

00:11:57.590 --> 00:12:00.750 align:middle line:84%
that our inner
authority based off

00:12:00.750 --> 00:12:03.930 align:middle line:84%
of our own spiritual
sovereignty is

00:12:03.930 --> 00:12:07.290 align:middle line:84%
what's trying to be
extracted, and that we do not

00:12:07.290 --> 00:12:10.960 align:middle line:84%
have to give away, this is
when we're in our center,

00:12:10.960 --> 00:12:14.260 align:middle line:84%
and this is when we're operating
now from our inner authority.

00:12:14.260 --> 00:12:17.790 align:middle line:84%
So how we take back our power
from revelation of the method

00:12:17.790 --> 00:12:20.610 align:middle line:84%
and from predictive
programming is by, one,

00:12:20.610 --> 00:12:23.650 align:middle line:84%
recognizing when we
are being manipulated.

00:12:23.650 --> 00:12:27.250 align:middle line:84%
When we recognize in real time,
when we are being manipulated,

00:12:27.250 --> 00:12:29.820 align:middle line:84%
now we are given
the free will choice

00:12:29.820 --> 00:12:32.830 align:middle line:90%
to consent or to not consent.

00:12:32.830 --> 00:12:35.790 align:middle line:84%
So once we're able to
become aware of something,

00:12:35.790 --> 00:12:37.990 align:middle line:84%
now we can do
something about this.

00:12:37.990 --> 00:12:40.860 align:middle line:90%
So awareness is first and key.

00:12:40.860 --> 00:12:46.030 align:middle line:84%
Then that awareness will
naturally raise our frequency.

00:12:46.030 --> 00:12:51.240 align:middle line:84%
And this is so important because
not all of the protection

00:12:51.240 --> 00:12:53.910 align:middle line:84%
and not all of the
defense mechanisms

00:12:53.910 --> 00:12:58.240 align:middle line:84%
that we need to employ have to
be done on the physical realm.

00:12:58.240 --> 00:13:02.860 align:middle line:84%
In fact, our frequency is
based off of our awareness.

00:13:02.860 --> 00:13:05.700 align:middle line:84%
And our awareness is
what truly ends up

00:13:05.700 --> 00:13:09.220 align:middle line:84%
protecting us in the
metaphysical realms the most.

00:13:09.220 --> 00:13:13.500 align:middle line:84%
So even though there's many ways
that we can protect ourselves,

00:13:13.500 --> 00:13:16.260 align:middle line:84%
awareness will always
be the strongest way

00:13:16.260 --> 00:13:18.880 align:middle line:84%
because it's linked
with our frequency.

00:13:18.880 --> 00:13:22.170 align:middle line:84%
So when we raise
our frequency, it

00:13:22.170 --> 00:13:25.440 align:middle line:84%
creates a natural defense
and a natural shield

00:13:25.440 --> 00:13:29.010 align:middle line:90%
against these tactics.

00:13:29.010 --> 00:13:31.200 align:middle line:84%
The second way that
we can counteract

00:13:31.200 --> 00:13:35.700 align:middle line:84%
revelation of the method is
going to be through healing.

00:13:35.700 --> 00:13:38.080 align:middle line:84%
It's always going to
come back to healing,

00:13:38.080 --> 00:13:43.080 align:middle line:84%
because what healing really
is, is cohesion and coherence.

00:13:43.080 --> 00:13:45.510 align:middle line:84%
So what we call
healing is actually

00:13:45.510 --> 00:13:49.620 align:middle line:84%
uniting different
fragments of our own being

00:13:49.620 --> 00:13:51.630 align:middle line:90%
and of our own body mind.

00:13:51.630 --> 00:13:54.870 align:middle line:84%
Because of that, that
is the most powerful way

00:13:54.870 --> 00:13:57.160 align:middle line:84%
to not just reclaim
our own power,

00:13:57.160 --> 00:14:01.300 align:middle line:84%
but to be able to
truly understand

00:14:01.300 --> 00:14:03.860 align:middle line:84%
all of the different
facets of reality.

00:14:03.860 --> 00:14:07.480 align:middle line:84%
We cannot understand more
reality if we're not healed

00:14:07.480 --> 00:14:12.200 align:middle line:84%
enough to bring our own
consciousness into coherency.

00:14:12.200 --> 00:14:16.600 align:middle line:84%
Coherency is how we
become more aware.

00:14:16.600 --> 00:14:21.310 align:middle line:84%
So coherency is actually
dependent on our ability

00:14:21.310 --> 00:14:25.220 align:middle line:84%
to bring internal
unity within ourselves.

00:14:25.220 --> 00:14:28.430 align:middle line:84%
And that internal unity
is done through healing.

00:14:28.430 --> 00:14:33.130 align:middle line:84%
When we're bringing internal
unity and internal harmony

00:14:33.130 --> 00:14:39.040 align:middle line:84%
into ourselves, that's
done through shadow work.

00:14:39.040 --> 00:14:42.430 align:middle line:84%
That's done through
inner child work.

00:14:42.430 --> 00:14:46.780 align:middle line:84%
That's done through
somatic healing.

00:14:46.780 --> 00:14:50.290 align:middle line:84%
That's done through
any tools and all tools

00:14:50.290 --> 00:14:55.555 align:middle line:84%
that we use to help bring more
integration into our body, mind,

00:14:55.555 --> 00:14:56.355 align:middle line:90%
and spirit.

00:14:56.355 --> 00:15:00.115 align:middle line:90%


00:15:00.115 --> 00:15:03.370 align:middle line:84%
The third way of counteracting
revelation of the method

00:15:03.370 --> 00:15:06.160 align:middle line:84%
is going to be done
through standing strong

00:15:06.160 --> 00:15:09.890 align:middle line:84%
in our own sovereignty,
through declarations.

00:15:09.890 --> 00:15:12.470 align:middle line:90%
Declarations are so powerful.

00:15:12.470 --> 00:15:17.710 align:middle line:84%
And they're how we withdraw our
consent and take back our power.

00:15:17.710 --> 00:15:22.300 align:middle line:84%
Declarations are anything that
we can think of, that we state,

00:15:22.300 --> 00:15:23.840 align:middle line:90%
and we verbalize.

00:15:23.840 --> 00:15:27.530 align:middle line:84%
That is a no to what
is taking place.

00:15:27.530 --> 00:15:31.010 align:middle line:84%
So when we say,
I do not consent,

00:15:31.010 --> 00:15:34.870 align:middle line:84%
that is a declaration that
withdraws our consent.

00:15:34.870 --> 00:15:38.540 align:middle line:84%
And it's a very powerful and
very popular declaration.

00:15:38.540 --> 00:15:43.540 align:middle line:84%
But we can also use the most
deeply hidden and esoteric code

00:15:43.540 --> 00:15:47.360 align:middle line:84%
word that tells the universe
directly, I do not consent.

00:15:47.360 --> 00:15:51.080 align:middle line:84%
And that declaration is
very brief but powerful.

00:15:51.080 --> 00:15:55.090 align:middle line:84%
It's the Masonic
code word of no.

00:15:55.090 --> 00:15:58.900 align:middle line:84%
No tells the universe
just as powerfully

00:15:58.900 --> 00:16:01.250 align:middle line:90%
as any statement or sentence.

00:16:01.250 --> 00:16:03.900 align:middle line:90%
We need to take back our no.

00:16:03.900 --> 00:16:06.840 align:middle line:84%
So declarations can
be very personal.

00:16:06.840 --> 00:16:08.220 align:middle line:90%
You can customize them.

00:16:08.220 --> 00:16:09.660 align:middle line:90%
You can make them your own.

00:16:09.660 --> 00:16:13.430 align:middle line:84%
In fact, declarations work
the best when we imbue

00:16:13.430 --> 00:16:17.360 align:middle line:84%
and we customize them with
our own creative ability.

00:16:17.360 --> 00:16:19.830 align:middle line:84%
But they also don't
need to be long,

00:16:19.830 --> 00:16:23.480 align:middle line:84%
and they do not need to be
complex, because a simple "no"

00:16:23.480 --> 00:16:29.630 align:middle line:84%
already tells the universe that
we do not consent to whatever

00:16:29.630 --> 00:16:34.280 align:middle line:84%
our subconscious is
being programmed with.

00:16:34.280 --> 00:16:39.890 align:middle line:84%
If there is far too much
incongruency and inconsistency

00:16:39.890 --> 00:16:43.230 align:middle line:84%
between our actions
and our declarations,

00:16:43.230 --> 00:16:46.320 align:middle line:84%
then our declarations
will not be powerful

00:16:46.320 --> 00:16:49.370 align:middle line:84%
because our actions
are what create

00:16:49.370 --> 00:16:52.470 align:middle line:84%
and respond to what's
being manifested.

00:16:52.470 --> 00:16:55.680 align:middle line:84%
So our actions will
override our declarations.

00:16:55.680 --> 00:16:58.400 align:middle line:84%
And this is what's very
important to understand,

00:16:58.400 --> 00:17:01.250 align:middle line:84%
is the consistency
that is required

00:17:01.250 --> 00:17:04.849 align:middle line:84%
between our beliefs,
what we know,

00:17:04.849 --> 00:17:10.520 align:middle line:84%
which is awareness, our
feelings, and our actions.

00:17:10.520 --> 00:17:13.940 align:middle line:84%
When all of these are in
resonance with each other

00:17:13.940 --> 00:17:17.910 align:middle line:84%
and in harmony, they don't
need to perfectly line up.

00:17:17.910 --> 00:17:20.119 align:middle line:84%
But once they're in
harmony with each other

00:17:20.119 --> 00:17:23.450 align:middle line:84%
and they're not
contradicting each other,

00:17:23.450 --> 00:17:26.569 align:middle line:84%
that's when the declarations
are going to really

00:17:26.569 --> 00:17:28.820 align:middle line:90%
be activated and be powerful.

00:17:28.820 --> 00:17:33.740 align:middle line:84%
In fact, any form of hypocrisy
weakens declarations.

00:17:33.740 --> 00:17:37.230 align:middle line:84%
And it weakens our own
creator being essence.

00:17:37.230 --> 00:17:43.070 align:middle line:84%
So if we're saying one
thing but we don't truly

00:17:43.070 --> 00:17:48.260 align:middle line:84%
believe it internally,
then it becomes a schism

00:17:48.260 --> 00:17:52.555 align:middle line:84%
with what we're saying
and what we truly believe.

00:17:52.555 --> 00:17:54.980 align:middle line:10%
This is so important
because if we're

00:17:54.980 --> 00:17:58.350 align:middle line:10%
saying something, such as
a declaration in this case,

00:17:58.350 --> 00:18:03.060 align:middle line:10%
but yet we don't actually
truly feel and believe it,

00:18:03.060 --> 00:18:06.930 align:middle line:10%
then there's going to
be a recalibration that

00:18:06.930 --> 00:18:11.160 align:middle line:10%
needs to take place between our
own thoughts and our own belief

00:18:11.160 --> 00:18:12.250 align:middle line:10%
systems.

00:18:12.250 --> 00:18:15.450 align:middle line:84%
And then the actions and
the declarations that get

00:18:15.450 --> 00:18:16.830 align:middle line:90%
put out from them.

00:18:16.830 --> 00:18:19.860 align:middle line:84%
When there is a strong
mismatch between what

00:18:19.860 --> 00:18:24.580 align:middle line:84%
we think, what we feel, what
we say, and our actions,

00:18:24.580 --> 00:18:27.630 align:middle line:84%
this is called
cognitive dissonance.

00:18:27.630 --> 00:18:30.810 align:middle line:84%
It's cognitive
dissonance because we

00:18:30.810 --> 00:18:33.760 align:middle line:84%
are in a state of
disharmony and dissonance.

00:18:33.760 --> 00:18:35.910 align:middle line:84%
So cognitive dissonance
can be looked

00:18:35.910 --> 00:18:38.050 align:middle line:90%
at as a disorganized state.

00:18:38.050 --> 00:18:40.810 align:middle line:84%
It can be looked at as
even a confused state.

00:18:40.810 --> 00:18:43.110 align:middle line:84%
And this confusion
is what creates

00:18:43.110 --> 00:18:46.230 align:middle line:90%
this state of incongruency.

00:18:46.230 --> 00:18:50.040 align:middle line:84%
The truth is, timelines
are not set in stone.

00:18:50.040 --> 00:18:52.570 align:middle line:84%
This is what's also
being hidden from us.

00:18:52.570 --> 00:18:55.530 align:middle line:84%
It's that in order
for us to truly feel

00:18:55.530 --> 00:18:59.800 align:middle line:84%
like everything is so out of
our control and inevitable,

00:18:59.800 --> 00:19:04.450 align:middle line:84%
we would actually need to be
put in a state of powerlessness.

00:19:04.450 --> 00:19:06.600 align:middle line:84%
And when we're in a
state of powerlessness,

00:19:06.600 --> 00:19:10.770 align:middle line:84%
now we're so rooted in
a fear-based reality

00:19:10.770 --> 00:19:13.770 align:middle line:84%
and fear-based thought forms
that now we can't actually

00:19:13.770 --> 00:19:16.510 align:middle line:90%
access what the truth is.

00:19:16.510 --> 00:19:20.140 align:middle line:84%
And the truth is, is that
timelines are not set in stone.

00:19:20.140 --> 00:19:25.150 align:middle line:84%
We contribute just as much to
the creation of these timelines,

00:19:25.150 --> 00:19:27.550 align:middle line:84%
whether we do it
unconsciously or not.

00:19:27.550 --> 00:19:30.210 align:middle line:84%
But we contribute all
of our creative power

00:19:30.210 --> 00:19:32.080 align:middle line:90%
to these manifestations.

00:19:32.080 --> 00:19:34.650 align:middle line:84%
And we can just as much
withdraw that power

00:19:34.650 --> 00:19:38.430 align:middle line:84%
and redirect it into
creating positive solutions

00:19:38.430 --> 00:19:41.790 align:middle line:90%
and positive timelines.

00:19:41.790 --> 00:19:44.370 align:middle line:84%
How we can counteract
revelation of the method

00:19:44.370 --> 00:19:48.160 align:middle line:84%
strongest is by staying in
our spiritual sovereignty.

00:19:48.160 --> 00:19:52.180 align:middle line:84%
This also includes avoiding
any spiritual bypassing.

00:19:52.180 --> 00:19:54.810 align:middle line:84%
Spiritual bypassing
is the tendency

00:19:54.810 --> 00:19:57.810 align:middle line:84%
to use spiritual
ideas or practices

00:19:57.810 --> 00:20:02.300 align:middle line:84%
to avoid dealing with difficult
emotions, psychological issues,

00:20:02.300 --> 00:20:04.040 align:middle line:90%
and developmental tasks.

00:20:04.040 --> 00:20:06.880 align:middle line:84%
It's essentially using
spirituality as a way

00:20:06.880 --> 00:20:11.560 align:middle line:84%
to bypass or sidestep facing
one's own personal challenges

00:20:11.560 --> 00:20:13.340 align:middle line:90%
and unresolved issues.

00:20:13.340 --> 00:20:15.310 align:middle line:84%
Many of us who are
growing and evolving

00:20:15.310 --> 00:20:17.020 align:middle line:84%
are going to run
into the pitfall

00:20:17.020 --> 00:20:20.210 align:middle line:84%
where we accidentally go
through spiritual bypassing.

00:20:20.210 --> 00:20:25.690 align:middle line:84%
But spiritual bypassing is not
a powerful frequency to be in.

00:20:25.690 --> 00:20:30.350 align:middle line:84%
And when we're talking about
growing in our own awareness,

00:20:30.350 --> 00:20:33.610 align:middle line:90%
that raises our frequency.

00:20:33.610 --> 00:20:36.410 align:middle line:84%
So when we're becoming
spiritually sovereign,

00:20:36.410 --> 00:20:39.740 align:middle line:84%
it's not always about learning
about fear-based things.

00:20:39.740 --> 00:20:43.840 align:middle line:84%
We just have to be able to
include that, acknowledge it

00:20:43.840 --> 00:20:47.970 align:middle line:84%
into our awareness, just as
much as positive and uplifting

00:20:47.970 --> 00:20:48.770 align:middle line:90%
things.

00:20:48.770 --> 00:20:52.460 align:middle line:84%
So spiritual bypassing
puts us at a disadvantage

00:20:52.460 --> 00:20:55.030 align:middle line:84%
because it's when
we're cutting off

00:20:55.030 --> 00:20:59.060 align:middle line:84%
a whole hemisphere of awareness
at the expense of the whole.

00:20:59.060 --> 00:21:02.860 align:middle line:84%
So once we're able to
avoid spiritual bypassing

00:21:02.860 --> 00:21:05.720 align:middle line:84%
and face the truth
of reality head on,

00:21:05.720 --> 00:21:08.180 align:middle line:84%
we're able to
integrate more of it.

00:21:08.180 --> 00:21:10.780 align:middle line:84%
And this allows us
to come into a deeper

00:21:10.780 --> 00:21:13.420 align:middle line:90%
stage of our own sovereignty.

00:21:13.420 --> 00:21:18.200 align:middle line:84%
Now we're truly operating from
our creator being essence.

00:21:18.200 --> 00:21:20.750 align:middle line:84%
And we're truly operating
from our creative power.

00:21:20.750 --> 00:21:25.840 align:middle line:84%
Now we're able to shape
reality with our consciousness.

00:21:25.840 --> 00:21:28.180 align:middle line:84%
The key to creating
your own reality

00:21:28.180 --> 00:21:30.670 align:middle line:84%
lies in recognizing
and rejecting

00:21:30.670 --> 00:21:32.920 align:middle line:90%
the forces that limit us.

00:21:32.920 --> 00:21:37.720 align:middle line:84%
By raising our consciousness
and taking back our sovereignty,

00:21:37.720 --> 00:21:40.840 align:middle line:84%
we reclaim the power
to manifest a life

00:21:40.840 --> 00:21:43.810 align:middle line:90%
of freedom and possibility.

00:21:43.810 --> 00:21:46.450 align:middle line:84%
The truth is, we've
always had that ability

00:21:46.450 --> 00:21:47.960 align:middle line:90%
to shape our reality.

00:21:47.960 --> 00:21:51.070 align:middle line:84%
Now it's time to awaken
and make it happen.

00:21:51.070 --> 00:21:52.370 align:middle line:90%
