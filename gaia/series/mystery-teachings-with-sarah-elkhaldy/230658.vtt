reality you deserve?

Let's break through the veil
and step into your true power.

00:01:43.445 --> 00:01:49.710 align:middle line:90%


00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:53.140 align:middle line:10%
What if the challenges
you face are not random

00:01:53.140 --> 00:01:56.580 align:middle line:10%
but part of a cosmic
curriculum, pushing you

00:01:56.580 --> 00:01:58.860 align:middle line:10%
towards spiritual awakening?

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:02.680 align:middle line:84%
At each crossroads, we're
faced with a choice--

00:02:02.680 --> 00:02:07.420 align:middle line:84%
stay asleep or confront
uncomfortable truths

00:02:07.420 --> 00:02:11.710 align:middle line:84%
that elevate us to
higher consciousness.

00:02:11.710 --> 00:02:15.400 align:middle line:84%
Are you ready to break free
from separation and align

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:20.020 align:middle line:84%
with the universal laws that
govern all of existence?

00:02:20.020 --> 00:02:23.360 align:middle line:10%
We may not see it, and
we may not even know it,

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:27.880 align:middle line:10%
but humanity is always being
put through rites of passage

00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:30.190 align:middle line:10%
that we can look
at as checkpoints

00:02:30.190 --> 00:02:34.150 align:middle line:10%
for our own spiritual evolution.

00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:36.730 align:middle line:84%
These checkpoints
are usually ones

00:02:36.730 --> 00:02:39.340 align:middle line:84%
that we can consider
dark nights of the soul

00:02:39.340 --> 00:02:42.550 align:middle line:84%
at a collective
level, and they always

00:02:42.550 --> 00:02:46.000 align:middle line:84%
have something to do
with pointing to darker

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:49.090 align:middle line:90%
elements of our reality.

00:02:49.090 --> 00:02:54.130 align:middle line:10%
These checkpoints and these
rites of passage for humanity

00:02:54.130 --> 00:02:59.870 align:middle line:10%
are linked with the objective
aspects of our experience,

00:02:59.870 --> 00:03:02.700 align:middle line:10%
also known as natural law.

00:03:02.700 --> 00:03:05.460 align:middle line:84%
Natural law is the
set of universal laws

00:03:05.460 --> 00:03:08.910 align:middle line:84%
that govern reality,
regardless of our awareness

00:03:08.910 --> 00:03:10.420 align:middle line:90%
or our agreement.

00:03:10.420 --> 00:03:14.290 align:middle line:84%
They're the ground rules that
at the core of this reality,

00:03:14.290 --> 00:03:17.730 align:middle line:84%
all beings are
spiritually sovereign

00:03:17.730 --> 00:03:20.820 align:middle line:90%
and have their own will.

00:03:20.820 --> 00:03:23.400 align:middle line:84%
This is so foundational
to this reality

00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:29.040 align:middle line:84%
that we understand this because
when we are out of alignment

00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:32.190 align:middle line:84%
with natural law, what
we're really doing

00:03:32.190 --> 00:03:36.030 align:middle line:84%
is invading another
person's freedom

00:03:36.030 --> 00:03:38.580 align:middle line:84%
that exists beyond
all hierarchies

00:03:38.580 --> 00:03:40.540 align:middle line:90%
and levels of status.

00:03:40.540 --> 00:03:48.040 align:middle line:84%
And when we invade or try to
assert our own will onto others,

00:03:48.040 --> 00:03:51.180 align:middle line:84%
what we're actually
doing is violating

00:03:51.180 --> 00:03:54.580 align:middle line:84%
another's universal
spiritual sovereignty,

00:03:54.580 --> 00:03:57.785 align:middle line:84%
and we're violating another
person's natural law.

00:03:57.785 --> 00:04:02.010 align:middle line:90%


00:04:02.010 --> 00:04:07.040 align:middle line:84%
The guiding principle or the
guiding force of natural law

00:04:07.040 --> 00:04:11.530 align:middle line:84%
is a very deeply esoteric
term that we normally

00:04:11.530 --> 00:04:17.600 align:middle line:84%
imbue our own projections
onto, which is morality.

00:04:17.600 --> 00:04:22.330 align:middle line:10%
Morality means that we never
invade another person's

00:04:22.330 --> 00:04:27.790 align:middle line:10%
free will, and we never
impose or inflict our will

00:04:27.790 --> 00:04:30.230 align:middle line:10%
upon another being's will.

00:04:30.230 --> 00:04:34.190 align:middle line:84%
This is what morality
means beyond all judgments,

00:04:34.190 --> 00:04:39.040 align:middle line:84%
all belief systems, and all
perceptions because so many

00:04:39.040 --> 00:04:43.300 align:middle line:84%
different ways we can interpret
and project our own beliefs onto

00:04:43.300 --> 00:04:44.960 align:middle line:90%
this term "morality."

00:04:44.960 --> 00:04:48.350 align:middle line:84%
But when we really peel back
all of the layers of it,

00:04:48.350 --> 00:04:51.700 align:middle line:84%
what we're really
looking at is our ability

00:04:51.700 --> 00:04:55.510 align:middle line:84%
to honor other
people as the creator

00:04:55.510 --> 00:04:58.660 align:middle line:84%
and honor other
people's wills, even

00:04:58.660 --> 00:05:01.070 align:middle line:90%
if they differ from our own.

00:05:01.070 --> 00:05:04.490 align:middle line:84%
And that would actually
create love and the fruits

00:05:04.490 --> 00:05:07.950 align:middle line:84%
of love, which is
order, all on its own

00:05:07.950 --> 00:05:11.270 align:middle line:84%
if we operated and
abided by natural law

00:05:11.270 --> 00:05:13.786 align:middle line:90%
through the vessel of morality.

00:05:13.786 --> 00:05:16.610 align:middle line:90%


00:05:16.610 --> 00:05:19.070 align:middle line:84%
Morality and dharma
are intimately

00:05:19.070 --> 00:05:20.810 align:middle line:90%
connected with one another.

00:05:20.810 --> 00:05:23.120 align:middle line:84%
When it comes to
morality and when

00:05:23.120 --> 00:05:25.970 align:middle line:84%
it comes to dharma, what
we're really looking at

00:05:25.970 --> 00:05:29.100 align:middle line:90%
is a case-by-case scenario.

00:05:29.100 --> 00:05:31.910 align:middle line:84%
We're not looking
for what is the good

00:05:31.910 --> 00:05:34.770 align:middle line:84%
and what is the bad
in all scenarios.

00:05:34.770 --> 00:05:37.790 align:middle line:84%
That's the interesting thing
because what is the greatest

00:05:37.790 --> 00:05:42.230 align:middle line:84%
good and what is right
action in one context

00:05:42.230 --> 00:05:46.470 align:middle line:84%
could actually change
dramatically in another context.

00:05:46.470 --> 00:05:49.580 align:middle line:84%
And because of that,
morality and dharma

00:05:49.580 --> 00:05:53.640 align:middle line:84%
aren't these fixed or even
dogmatic and rigid forces.

00:05:53.640 --> 00:05:58.310 align:middle line:84%
Instead, they depend on us
to be able to always see

00:05:58.310 --> 00:06:01.860 align:middle line:84%
what is the most conscious
action we can take

00:06:01.860 --> 00:06:05.460 align:middle line:84%
and what is the one that is for
that greater good beyond what it

00:06:05.460 --> 00:06:08.100 align:middle line:84%
looks like on the surface
because many times

00:06:08.100 --> 00:06:10.050 align:middle line:84%
we think we're doing
the right thing

00:06:10.050 --> 00:06:13.320 align:middle line:84%
when it's actually
a very wrong action

00:06:13.320 --> 00:06:16.170 align:middle line:90%
in the eyes of natural law.

00:06:16.170 --> 00:06:20.680 align:middle line:84%
So this isn't based upon any
form of spiritual belief system

00:06:20.680 --> 00:06:24.280 align:middle line:84%
because this is really
personal and intimate to us,

00:06:24.280 --> 00:06:28.050 align:middle line:84%
being able to align with what
we know to be the greatest

00:06:28.050 --> 00:06:31.230 align:middle line:90%
good in a situation.

00:06:31.230 --> 00:06:35.700 align:middle line:84%
Now, at a higher level of
reality, what we consider right

00:06:35.700 --> 00:06:38.620 align:middle line:84%
and what we consider
wrong are debatable

00:06:38.620 --> 00:06:43.750 align:middle line:84%
because higher levels of reality
are operating from non-duality.

00:06:43.750 --> 00:06:46.650 align:middle line:84%
We don't see the conditions
and the judgments that

00:06:46.650 --> 00:06:49.350 align:middle line:84%
are placed onto things
to consider them wrong

00:06:49.350 --> 00:06:51.750 align:middle line:90%
or to consider them right.

00:06:51.750 --> 00:06:55.560 align:middle line:84%
And yet, even within
that nuance and even

00:06:55.560 --> 00:06:59.290 align:middle line:84%
within that space of
unconditional love,

00:06:59.290 --> 00:07:01.860 align:middle line:84%
there's still a
higher truth, which

00:07:01.860 --> 00:07:08.770 align:middle line:84%
is that in unconditional
love and in non-duality, we

00:07:08.770 --> 00:07:13.090 align:middle line:84%
would still want a
willpower and a being

00:07:13.090 --> 00:07:17.180 align:middle line:84%
to be honored by another
willpower and another being.

00:07:17.180 --> 00:07:20.500 align:middle line:84%
And when we see
violations and when

00:07:20.500 --> 00:07:25.270 align:middle line:84%
we see impositions of one
person's set of beliefs

00:07:25.270 --> 00:07:29.350 align:middle line:84%
or one person's violence
inflicted upon another's, that's

00:07:29.350 --> 00:07:32.530 align:middle line:84%
when we start really
disconnecting with the concept

00:07:32.530 --> 00:07:34.510 align:middle line:90%
of love in general.

00:07:34.510 --> 00:07:39.100 align:middle line:10%
So even though non-duality
holds all truths within it

00:07:39.100 --> 00:07:42.880 align:middle line:10%
and no judgment, which is what
the fruits of unconditional love

00:07:42.880 --> 00:07:48.350 align:middle line:10%
are, we are still, even within
these higher levels of reality,

00:07:48.350 --> 00:07:52.990 align:middle line:10%
honoring the fact that
love does have orders

00:07:52.990 --> 00:07:58.420 align:middle line:10%
and that love does have its
own structure in order for us

00:07:58.420 --> 00:08:02.080 align:middle line:10%
to all benefit and
to all experience

00:08:02.080 --> 00:08:04.135 align:middle line:10%
its unconditional support.

00:08:04.135 --> 00:08:08.840 align:middle line:90%


00:08:08.840 --> 00:08:13.040 align:middle line:84%
So many of us seek and
desire really cool spiritual

00:08:13.040 --> 00:08:18.290 align:middle line:84%
experiences and really higher
vibrational states of well-being

00:08:18.290 --> 00:08:20.510 align:middle line:90%
for the collective.

00:08:20.510 --> 00:08:24.420 align:middle line:84%
And it's through natural
law that we even get there.

00:08:24.420 --> 00:08:27.230 align:middle line:84%
Humanity isn't
spiritually mature enough

00:08:27.230 --> 00:08:30.980 align:middle line:84%
to be given full access
to higher realms or even

00:08:30.980 --> 00:08:34.010 align:middle line:90%
extraterrestrial encounters yet.

00:08:34.010 --> 00:08:38.210 align:middle line:84%
It's when we have embodied and
fully understood these ground

00:08:38.210 --> 00:08:41.870 align:middle line:84%
rules to our reality
that then we can progress

00:08:41.870 --> 00:08:45.860 align:middle line:90%
to the next rite of passage.

00:08:45.860 --> 00:08:48.560 align:middle line:84%
So the three conditions
that humanity

00:08:48.560 --> 00:08:53.360 align:middle line:84%
needs to meet in order to align
with and be in healthy standing

00:08:53.360 --> 00:08:58.400 align:middle line:84%
with natural law is to first
be absolutely responsible

00:08:58.400 --> 00:09:02.060 align:middle line:84%
for all of our actions
and even our non-actions.

00:09:02.060 --> 00:09:07.670 align:middle line:84%
The second is to be fully
aware of our free will,

00:09:07.670 --> 00:09:10.300 align:middle line:84%
that we have free will
whether we are aware of it

00:09:10.300 --> 00:09:13.720 align:middle line:84%
or not, whether we want
to acknowledge it or not.

00:09:13.720 --> 00:09:17.560 align:middle line:84%
Free will is a constant,
and it is omnipresent.

00:09:17.560 --> 00:09:19.790 align:middle line:90%
So all of us have free will.

00:09:19.790 --> 00:09:24.280 align:middle line:84%
It's just a matter of what
we choose to do with it.

00:09:24.280 --> 00:09:28.360 align:middle line:84%
The third is not
violating another being,

00:09:28.360 --> 00:09:30.340 align:middle line:90%
to the best of our ability.

00:09:30.340 --> 00:09:35.800 align:middle line:84%
This is so crucial because we
cause so much incidental harm

00:09:35.800 --> 00:09:38.600 align:middle line:84%
by subtle ways of
violating another.

00:09:38.600 --> 00:09:42.490 align:middle line:10%
But once we really start
to expand our consciousness

00:09:42.490 --> 00:09:45.070 align:middle line:10%
and become aware
of this, this is

00:09:45.070 --> 00:09:48.290 align:middle line:10%
what allows us to
rectify those actions.

00:09:48.290 --> 00:09:51.320 align:middle line:84%
And once we start, to
the best of our ability,

00:09:51.320 --> 00:09:54.490 align:middle line:84%
not violating another
being's free will,

00:09:54.490 --> 00:09:57.070 align:middle line:84%
what ends up happening
at a collective level

00:09:57.070 --> 00:10:02.920 align:middle line:84%
is that we're now able to unlock
more psychic abilities and even

00:10:02.920 --> 00:10:06.830 align:middle line:84%
unlock contact with
higher-dimensional beings.

00:10:06.830 --> 00:10:10.700 align:middle line:84%
We must understand and live
in alignment with natural law

00:10:10.700 --> 00:10:14.430 align:middle line:84%
before we're reaching
higher levels of reality

00:10:14.430 --> 00:10:17.240 align:middle line:84%
because the higher
levels of reality

00:10:17.240 --> 00:10:19.670 align:middle line:84%
are responsible
enough to already

00:10:19.670 --> 00:10:21.960 align:middle line:90%
be abiding by natural law.

00:10:21.960 --> 00:10:23.310 align:middle line:90%
So do you see?

00:10:23.310 --> 00:10:26.180 align:middle line:84%
What we're doing is
actually growing up

00:10:26.180 --> 00:10:30.740 align:middle line:84%
in our spiritual maturity to be
able to be a vibrational match

00:10:30.740 --> 00:10:34.730 align:middle line:84%
to all of those other spiritual
and higher vibrational

00:10:34.730 --> 00:10:40.040 align:middle line:84%
experiences that we
want for our world.

00:10:40.040 --> 00:10:44.210 align:middle line:84%
So to really be clear
about what natural law is,

00:10:44.210 --> 00:10:48.380 align:middle line:84%
every individual is spiritually
sovereign and, therefore,

00:10:48.380 --> 00:10:54.710 align:middle line:84%
accountable for their actions
and also for their non-actions,

00:10:54.710 --> 00:10:58.970 align:middle line:84%
for their apathy
as well as whatever

00:10:58.970 --> 00:11:04.100 align:middle line:84%
is motivating us from our
shadow or unconscious reasoning.

00:11:04.100 --> 00:11:09.280 align:middle line:84%
What this does is create what
we know as the force of karma.

00:11:09.280 --> 00:11:12.060 align:middle line:84%
Karma is the
mechanism that holds

00:11:12.060 --> 00:11:18.180 align:middle line:84%
us accountable through the
feedback loop of natural law.

00:11:18.180 --> 00:11:21.850 align:middle line:84%
Natural law and karma
are one and the same.

00:11:21.850 --> 00:11:24.790 align:middle line:84%
They are extensions
of one another.

00:11:24.790 --> 00:11:26.850 align:middle line:84%
So when we're talking
about natural law

00:11:26.850 --> 00:11:31.690 align:middle line:84%
through the extension and the
emphasis of it being as karma,

00:11:31.690 --> 00:11:33.930 align:middle line:84%
what we're really
seeing is that karma

00:11:33.930 --> 00:11:36.400 align:middle line:90%
is playing a guiding force.

00:11:36.400 --> 00:11:39.730 align:middle line:84%
It's not always punishing us,
and it's not always an enemy.

00:11:39.730 --> 00:11:42.450 align:middle line:10%
It is acting as
the guiding force

00:11:42.450 --> 00:11:46.800 align:middle line:10%
for us to understand
natural law and for us

00:11:46.800 --> 00:11:50.100 align:middle line:10%
to align with
correct action, which

00:11:50.100 --> 00:11:53.460 align:middle line:10%
would be to align with
our ability not to invade

00:11:53.460 --> 00:11:56.310 align:middle line:10%
another person's free will.

00:11:56.310 --> 00:12:00.480 align:middle line:84%
So what we're doing is getting
through our karma, a mirror

00:12:00.480 --> 00:12:05.290 align:middle line:84%
of us either taking incorrect
actions that are violating

00:12:05.290 --> 00:12:08.470 align:middle line:84%
another person's free
will, or what we're seeing

00:12:08.470 --> 00:12:13.690 align:middle line:84%
is the karma and, therefore, the
mirror of us not taking actions

00:12:13.690 --> 00:12:16.450 align:middle line:84%
on behalf of others
and not taking actions

00:12:16.450 --> 00:12:21.520 align:middle line:84%
on behalf of our world
and its free will.

00:12:21.520 --> 00:12:26.630 align:middle line:84%
So these mirrors of karma are
what every spiritual system,

00:12:26.630 --> 00:12:30.470 align:middle line:84%
whether it's mainstream
or in mysticism,

00:12:30.470 --> 00:12:36.100 align:middle line:84%
are all referring to by the
name The Golden Rule, which is,

00:12:36.100 --> 00:12:40.630 align:middle line:84%
do unto others as you would
have them do unto you.

00:12:40.630 --> 00:12:44.500 align:middle line:84%
This is the simplest way
to understand natural law,

00:12:44.500 --> 00:12:47.630 align:middle line:84%
and that's what karma
is in a nutshell.

00:12:47.630 --> 00:12:51.130 align:middle line:10%
Each of us are equal
and have our own will

00:12:51.130 --> 00:12:55.030 align:middle line:10%
that needs to be respected
because all of us

00:12:55.030 --> 00:12:58.620 align:middle line:10%
have the same level and
capacity of spiritual freedom.

00:12:58.620 --> 00:13:01.810 align:middle line:90%


00:13:01.810 --> 00:13:07.770 align:middle line:84%
So if love creates order and
order is experienced as karma,

00:13:07.770 --> 00:13:12.440 align:middle line:84%
then unconsciousness would
be linked to separation,

00:13:12.440 --> 00:13:18.210 align:middle line:84%
and it would be linked to chaos
and even lower vibratory states.

00:13:18.210 --> 00:13:20.480 align:middle line:84%
And so I want to really
make this distinction

00:13:20.480 --> 00:13:22.640 align:middle line:84%
when it comes to
natural law, how

00:13:22.640 --> 00:13:27.500 align:middle line:84%
aligning with it creates
and produces love and order,

00:13:27.500 --> 00:13:33.000 align:middle line:84%
and not aligning with it
creates separation, fear, chaos,

00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:35.390 align:middle line:90%
and even control.

00:13:35.390 --> 00:13:39.080 align:middle line:84%
So this state of
being when we're not

00:13:39.080 --> 00:13:43.280 align:middle line:84%
in alignment with natural law
and when we're in a separation

00:13:43.280 --> 00:13:46.400 align:middle line:84%
consciousness, we
will accidentally

00:13:46.400 --> 00:13:50.360 align:middle line:84%
or even unintentionally
cause harm and inflict

00:13:50.360 --> 00:13:51.960 align:middle line:90%
harm onto others.

00:13:51.960 --> 00:13:55.160 align:middle line:84%
And this is what's really
important to understand

00:13:55.160 --> 00:13:56.850 align:middle line:90%
about natural law.

00:13:56.850 --> 00:14:01.410 align:middle line:84%
It's not always based off
of the actions that we take.

00:14:01.410 --> 00:14:04.550 align:middle line:84%
It's also factoring
in the actions

00:14:04.550 --> 00:14:07.780 align:middle line:84%
we don't take
because the actions

00:14:07.780 --> 00:14:11.350 align:middle line:84%
we don't take cause
just as much damage

00:14:11.350 --> 00:14:16.990 align:middle line:84%
and just as much harm as
taking harmful actions.

00:14:16.990 --> 00:14:22.450 align:middle line:84%
The golden rule is also where we
get our true esoteric definition

00:14:22.450 --> 00:14:26.530 align:middle line:84%
of evil and ignorance
because when we are not

00:14:26.530 --> 00:14:30.100 align:middle line:84%
abiding by natural law,
and when we are not

00:14:30.100 --> 00:14:35.350 align:middle line:84%
being the caretakers of humanity
and taking correct actions

00:14:35.350 --> 00:14:39.340 align:middle line:84%
to help others, not
just awaken, but also

00:14:39.340 --> 00:14:42.700 align:middle line:84%
understand what
natural law is, this

00:14:42.700 --> 00:14:45.500 align:middle line:84%
is where we get
further away from love.

00:14:45.500 --> 00:14:49.810 align:middle line:84%
And that's why not being in
alignment with the golden rule

00:14:49.810 --> 00:14:54.700 align:middle line:84%
naturally produces ignorance
and naturally produces

00:14:54.700 --> 00:14:59.170 align:middle line:90%
apathy, which turn into evil.

00:14:59.170 --> 00:15:02.620 align:middle line:84%
So when we think about evil,
we're normally thinking about it

00:15:02.620 --> 00:15:04.940 align:middle line:90%
from a very dualistic sense.

00:15:04.940 --> 00:15:07.670 align:middle line:84%
It's usually that
evil is something

00:15:07.670 --> 00:15:09.870 align:middle line:90%
that is very malevolent.

00:15:09.870 --> 00:15:12.920 align:middle line:84%
But now once we understand
that the golden rule is

00:15:12.920 --> 00:15:14.810 align:middle line:84%
what this is all
based off of, we

00:15:14.810 --> 00:15:17.240 align:middle line:84%
can see that the
further away that we

00:15:17.240 --> 00:15:23.100 align:middle line:84%
are from doing unto others as we
would want them to do unto us,

00:15:23.100 --> 00:15:28.460 align:middle line:84%
that then we start going into
more and more separation, which

00:15:28.460 --> 00:15:30.930 align:middle line:90%
produces more and more fear.

00:15:30.930 --> 00:15:35.190 align:middle line:84%
And that's what the heart
of evil really means.

00:15:35.190 --> 00:15:38.240 align:middle line:84%
It means when we are so
separated from this truth

00:15:38.240 --> 00:15:43.040 align:middle line:84%
that now all of our actions are
either coming from explicit harm

00:15:43.040 --> 00:15:44.000 align:middle line:90%
or apathy.

00:15:44.000 --> 00:15:46.625 align:middle line:90%


00:15:46.625 --> 00:15:51.090 align:middle line:84%
To break free from this
non-action or wrong action,

00:15:51.090 --> 00:15:55.130 align:middle line:84%
we need to align with truth
and take conscious actions

00:15:55.130 --> 00:15:58.670 align:middle line:90%
or risk perpetuating harm.

00:15:58.670 --> 00:16:03.110 align:middle line:84%
Humanity is always being put
through rites of passage.

00:16:03.110 --> 00:16:05.510 align:middle line:84%
These rites of
passage are all a part

00:16:05.510 --> 00:16:08.670 align:middle line:84%
of what we can call
free-will checkpoints that

00:16:08.670 --> 00:16:12.450 align:middle line:84%
show us disturbing,
shocking, even

00:16:12.450 --> 00:16:15.790 align:middle line:90%
very dark elements of reality.

00:16:15.790 --> 00:16:20.010 align:middle line:84%
And they show this to us with
a very spiritual intention

00:16:20.010 --> 00:16:23.190 align:middle line:84%
behind it, even if it's
not coming from very

00:16:23.190 --> 00:16:25.440 align:middle line:90%
high vibrational sources.

00:16:25.440 --> 00:16:29.100 align:middle line:10%
And what they're showing
us is our own ability

00:16:29.100 --> 00:16:31.620 align:middle line:10%
to align with what
is right, what

00:16:31.620 --> 00:16:35.890 align:middle line:10%
is good, which is taking
conscious actions--

00:16:35.890 --> 00:16:38.380 align:middle line:10%
conscious actions
to awaken others

00:16:38.380 --> 00:16:42.120 align:middle line:10%
to help ourselves become
more aware and to help others

00:16:42.120 --> 00:16:46.180 align:middle line:10%
become more aware of these
darker elements of reality

00:16:46.180 --> 00:16:50.790 align:middle line:10%
but for the ultimate
purpose of correcting them.

00:16:50.790 --> 00:16:54.450 align:middle line:84%
This is always going to be
pointed back to our ability

00:16:54.450 --> 00:16:58.080 align:middle line:84%
to face these darker
elements of reality

00:16:58.080 --> 00:17:03.870 align:middle line:84%
for the ultimate higher purpose
of us being able to integrate

00:17:03.870 --> 00:17:08.030 align:middle line:84%
more awareness of what reality
is, both the light and the dark,

00:17:08.030 --> 00:17:10.900 align:middle line:84%
and then, with our
free will, choose

00:17:10.900 --> 00:17:14.000 align:middle line:84%
what we stand for
with our actions,

00:17:14.000 --> 00:17:16.060 align:middle line:90%
with our level of awareness.

00:17:16.060 --> 00:17:19.849 align:middle line:84%
Will we incorporate
more of this reality,

00:17:19.849 --> 00:17:23.690 align:middle line:84%
even if it's uncomfortable,
in the name of love?

00:17:23.690 --> 00:17:26.589 align:middle line:84%
Or will we turn a blind
eye and, therefore,

00:17:26.589 --> 00:17:29.985 align:middle line:84%
feed ignorance,
which produces evil?

00:17:29.985 --> 00:17:32.650 align:middle line:90%


00:17:32.650 --> 00:17:35.800 align:middle line:84%
There is a karmic
responsibility that comes

00:17:35.800 --> 00:17:38.150 align:middle line:90%
with us being sovereign beings.

00:17:38.150 --> 00:17:40.370 align:middle line:90%
That's what makes us sovereign.

00:17:40.370 --> 00:17:42.580 align:middle line:84%
And that karmic
responsibility is

00:17:42.580 --> 00:17:47.080 align:middle line:84%
that if we fail to act when
shown disturbing truths,

00:17:47.080 --> 00:17:52.660 align:middle line:84%
we accumulate those negative
mirrors, those negative actions

00:17:52.660 --> 00:17:54.220 align:middle line:90%
back to us.

00:17:54.220 --> 00:17:56.840 align:middle line:84%
From a higher level
of the universe,

00:17:56.840 --> 00:18:02.840 align:middle line:84%
there's no differentiation, no
matter the proximity, between us

00:18:02.840 --> 00:18:04.840 align:middle line:84%
if we are staying
quiet and apathetic

00:18:04.840 --> 00:18:10.580 align:middle line:84%
to evil versus the actual action
and the actual person or group

00:18:10.580 --> 00:18:12.510 align:middle line:90%
doing the evil bidding.

00:18:12.510 --> 00:18:15.020 align:middle line:84%
And I know that that
might come across

00:18:15.020 --> 00:18:18.600 align:middle line:84%
as that being too harsh
of the universe to judge.

00:18:18.600 --> 00:18:22.730 align:middle line:84%
But this is why knowing
natural law is so important

00:18:22.730 --> 00:18:25.640 align:middle line:84%
and has been so deeply
hidden in the first place.

00:18:25.640 --> 00:18:31.040 align:middle line:84%
Our actions and our non-actions
have massive ripple effects

00:18:31.040 --> 00:18:33.240 align:middle line:90%
beyond what we can even see.

00:18:33.240 --> 00:18:38.420 align:middle line:84%
And the power of our actions
and the power of our non-actions

00:18:38.420 --> 00:18:44.510 align:middle line:84%
have equal force in any event
that we see inside our world

00:18:44.510 --> 00:18:47.300 align:middle line:84%
and in the human
consciousness since we

00:18:47.300 --> 00:18:50.976 align:middle line:84%
are all a part of the unified
field of consciousness.

00:18:50.976 --> 00:18:54.140 align:middle line:90%


00:18:54.140 --> 00:18:57.860 align:middle line:84%
Now, I know what we just covered
could be perceived as pretty

00:18:57.860 --> 00:19:02.360 align:middle line:84%
bleak, but this is like
a dark night of the soul

00:19:02.360 --> 00:19:06.360 align:middle line:84%
that humanity is faced with
for its spiritual evolution,

00:19:06.360 --> 00:19:09.090 align:middle line:90%
and it's not for want.

00:19:09.090 --> 00:19:13.230 align:middle line:84%
What happens when we're able to
come to this level of maturity

00:19:13.230 --> 00:19:16.080 align:middle line:90%
is nothing short of miraculous.

00:19:16.080 --> 00:19:20.230 align:middle line:84%
It is how we amplify our
manifestation powers.

00:19:20.230 --> 00:19:23.550 align:middle line:84%
When we're able to
align with natural law,

00:19:23.550 --> 00:19:28.660 align:middle line:84%
natural law manifests
to us times 10.

00:19:28.660 --> 00:19:31.890 align:middle line:84%
We are literally placed
with more creator

00:19:31.890 --> 00:19:37.480 align:middle line:84%
power available to us because
we are in alignment with source.

00:19:37.480 --> 00:19:40.290 align:middle line:84%
We are in alignment
with the perception

00:19:40.290 --> 00:19:42.160 align:middle line:90%
of unconditional love.

00:19:42.160 --> 00:19:43.750 align:middle line:90%
So there's no blocks.

00:19:43.750 --> 00:19:45.550 align:middle line:90%
There's no distortions.

00:19:45.550 --> 00:19:50.190 align:middle line:84%
We're able to be physical
manifestations of that higher

00:19:50.190 --> 00:19:53.430 align:middle line:84%
level of reality
directly without having

00:19:53.430 --> 00:19:56.250 align:middle line:84%
the karmic projections
and the karmic lessons

00:19:56.250 --> 00:19:59.970 align:middle line:90%
shown to us repetitively.

00:19:59.970 --> 00:20:02.130 align:middle line:84%
Could you think of
the possibilities

00:20:02.130 --> 00:20:04.920 align:middle line:84%
that humanity can
manifest for the world

00:20:04.920 --> 00:20:08.250 align:middle line:84%
when we're operating
from natural law?

00:20:08.250 --> 00:20:12.120 align:middle line:84%
The oceans would most
likely purify themselves

00:20:12.120 --> 00:20:14.970 align:middle line:90%
at this level of vibration.

00:20:14.970 --> 00:20:18.690 align:middle line:84%
We would actually see such
a strong paradigm shift

00:20:18.690 --> 00:20:21.510 align:middle line:84%
that we can no
longer consider a lot

00:20:21.510 --> 00:20:26.130 align:middle line:84%
of the systems that are in place
right now genuinely healthy.

00:20:26.130 --> 00:20:30.880 align:middle line:84%
Instead of a competition
dog eats dog-based reality,

00:20:30.880 --> 00:20:36.120 align:middle line:84%
we would all be able to pursue
our most natural and artistic

00:20:36.120 --> 00:20:41.860 align:middle line:84%
expressions of ourselves because
our reality supports that.

00:20:41.860 --> 00:20:47.310 align:middle line:84%
And our reality is not fighting
the karmic and oppositional flow

00:20:47.310 --> 00:20:52.020 align:middle line:84%
of what it is to impose
ourselves onto others.

00:20:52.020 --> 00:20:55.470 align:middle line:84%
Do you see the level of
order and the level of love

00:20:55.470 --> 00:20:59.890 align:middle line:84%
that would be able to flow from
all directions of this paradigm,

00:20:59.890 --> 00:21:04.680 align:middle line:84%
simply by being able to align
with this higher perception?

00:21:04.680 --> 00:21:08.460 align:middle line:10%
Because natural law
is about our rights.

00:21:08.460 --> 00:21:13.810 align:middle line:84%
As spiritual beings in physical
forms in a physical reality,

00:21:13.810 --> 00:21:17.250 align:middle line:90%
every being is free.

00:21:17.250 --> 00:21:20.850 align:middle line:84%
As we start truly
embodying natural law

00:21:20.850 --> 00:21:23.100 align:middle line:84%
and living in
alignment with it, we

00:21:23.100 --> 00:21:26.520 align:middle line:84%
will start to have manifested
before us effortlessly

00:21:26.520 --> 00:21:29.730 align:middle line:84%
all of those higher
vibrational experiences that

00:21:29.730 --> 00:21:32.040 align:middle line:90%
lead us to a new Earth.

00:21:32.040 --> 00:21:36.120 align:middle line:84%
Understanding the golden rule
and aligning with natural law

00:21:36.120 --> 00:21:38.410 align:middle line:90%
isn't just a moral choice.

00:21:38.410 --> 00:21:42.660 align:middle line:84%
It's the key to unlocking
spiritual sovereignty and even

00:21:42.660 --> 00:21:44.520 align:middle line:90%
collective evolution.

00:21:44.520 --> 00:21:47.760 align:middle line:84%
When we recognize
that our actions have

00:21:47.760 --> 00:21:52.020 align:middle line:84%
universal consequences, we
begin to consciously create

00:21:52.020 --> 00:21:54.810 align:middle line:90%
the reality we desire.

00:21:54.810 --> 00:21:59.220 align:middle line:84%
The question is, will you
choose love and freedom

00:21:59.220 --> 00:22:01.680 align:middle line:90%
or remain blind to the truth?

00:22:01.680 --> 00:22:05.030 align:middle line:90%
