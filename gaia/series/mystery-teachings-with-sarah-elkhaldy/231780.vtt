00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:23.750 align:middle line:84%
What if there was an ancient
secret process within your body

00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:26.990 align:middle line:84%
that could awaken
your highest potential

00:00:26.990 --> 00:00:30.620 align:middle line:84%
and transform every
aspect of your life?

00:00:30.620 --> 00:00:34.340 align:middle line:84%
A mystical substance
known across civilizations

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:38.000 align:middle line:84%
as the sacred
secretion, holds the key

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:42.860 align:middle line:84%
to unlocking spiritual power
through an alchemical journey

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:46.010 align:middle line:90%
within your own being.

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:50.146 align:middle line:84%
Could this be the missing link
to your spiritual evolution?

00:00:50.146 --> 00:00:53.990 align:middle line:90%


00:00:53.990 --> 00:00:57.170 align:middle line:10%
We get the name sacred
secretion through

00:00:57.170 --> 00:01:01.430 align:middle line:10%
the esoteric Christian
work of George Carey.

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:05.800 align:middle line:10%
But this process has been
known by many different names

00:01:05.800 --> 00:01:10.690 align:middle line:10%
and through both Eastern and
Western branches of mysticism,

00:01:10.690 --> 00:01:15.790 align:middle line:10%
so this practice is across
all ancient civilizations.

00:01:15.790 --> 00:01:20.920 align:middle line:84%
This secretion has been known
in Vedic terminology as soma.

00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:23.650 align:middle line:10%
But in alchemical
terminology, it also

00:01:23.650 --> 00:01:28.250 align:middle line:10%
goes by the coded name Prima
Materia and Green Lion.

00:01:28.250 --> 00:01:30.820 align:middle line:10%
This is also the
same substance that's

00:01:30.820 --> 00:01:34.090 align:middle line:10%
being referred to in
the Alchemical Wedding.

00:01:34.090 --> 00:01:37.060 align:middle line:10%
In Western civilization,
this took on the term

00:01:37.060 --> 00:01:40.540 align:middle line:10%
as the Christed oil,
the anointed oil that

00:01:40.540 --> 00:01:46.210 align:middle line:10%
is created in small secretions
within the claustrum

00:01:46.210 --> 00:01:48.020 align:middle line:10%
of our midbrain.

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:52.540 align:middle line:10%
And that's what in hermeticism
the emerald tablet is actually

00:01:52.540 --> 00:01:53.920 align:middle line:10%
referring to.

00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:59.800 align:middle line:84%
It's the descent of this Prima
Materia down our spinal column

00:01:59.800 --> 00:02:03.770 align:middle line:90%
into the sacral chakra.

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:06.420 align:middle line:84%
When we're talking about
the sacred secretion,

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:09.259 align:middle line:84%
this is something that
is hidden, even embedded,

00:02:09.259 --> 00:02:13.310 align:middle line:84%
within plain sight
through exoteric knowledge

00:02:13.310 --> 00:02:17.285 align:middle line:90%
versus esoteric knowledge.

00:02:17.285 --> 00:02:20.540 align:middle line:84%
So it is the difference
between exoteric knowledge

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:23.540 align:middle line:90%
and esoteric knowledge.

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:28.110 align:middle line:84%
Exoteric knowledge is
exactly what it sounds like.

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:31.080 align:middle line:90%
It is an exoskeleton.

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:33.440 align:middle line:90%
It is an outer layer.

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:38.340 align:middle line:84%
While esoteric knowledge
is the inner layer.

00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:43.580 align:middle line:84%
It merely requires a little
bit more depth in our ability

00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:47.060 align:middle line:84%
to comprehend and
to truly understand

00:02:47.060 --> 00:02:50.040 align:middle line:90%
any knowledge or any concept.

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:53.090 align:middle line:84%
And when this is done,
now we're getting

00:02:53.090 --> 00:02:55.470 align:middle line:90%
into the esoteric layers.

00:02:55.470 --> 00:03:00.220 align:middle line:84%
So the sacred secretion
is the esoteric wisdom

00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:06.730 align:middle line:84%
of how to embody and
awaken our higher self.

00:03:06.730 --> 00:03:11.560 align:middle line:84%
So let's break down all of
the stages of this process

00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:15.610 align:middle line:84%
before we get into the practices
that will transmute it.

00:03:15.610 --> 00:03:18.470 align:middle line:90%
The claustrum secretes oil.

00:03:18.470 --> 00:03:23.230 align:middle line:84%
It gets transported and
divided by the thalamus

00:03:23.230 --> 00:03:27.010 align:middle line:84%
into our endocrine system
through the pineal gland

00:03:27.010 --> 00:03:30.520 align:middle line:84%
and the pituitary
gland's channels.

00:03:30.520 --> 00:03:34.120 align:middle line:84%
The pineal gland's
channels are secreting

00:03:34.120 --> 00:03:37.820 align:middle line:90%
the hormones DMT and melatonin.

00:03:37.820 --> 00:03:41.680 align:middle line:84%
And these are golden,
honey-colored secretions

00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:46.160 align:middle line:84%
which are both known for
their regenerative, antiaging,

00:03:46.160 --> 00:03:49.390 align:middle line:90%
and antioxidant properties.

00:03:49.390 --> 00:03:54.640 align:middle line:84%
The pituitary gland's channels
are secreting clear-coated,

00:03:54.640 --> 00:04:00.730 align:middle line:84%
milkish even, secretions of
vasopressin and oxytocin,

00:04:00.730 --> 00:04:07.510 align:middle line:84%
which then descend and meet up
with the DMT and the melatonin

00:04:07.510 --> 00:04:09.580 align:middle line:90%
at the base of the skull.

00:04:09.580 --> 00:04:13.360 align:middle line:84%
This is what the milk and
honey is actually referring to,

00:04:13.360 --> 00:04:16.500 align:middle line:84%
this land where it
becomes purified

00:04:16.500 --> 00:04:20.850 align:middle line:84%
and even more
amplified in its power.

00:04:20.850 --> 00:04:23.460 align:middle line:84%
These secretions
continue to descend

00:04:23.460 --> 00:04:27.970 align:middle line:84%
through the cerebrospinal
fluid, down the spinal column,

00:04:27.970 --> 00:04:33.000 align:middle line:84%
and make their way to the heart
center where they are amplified,

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:36.390 align:middle line:84%
and then continue to
travel all the way down

00:04:36.390 --> 00:04:39.090 align:middle line:90%
to the sacral chakra.

00:04:39.090 --> 00:04:44.400 align:middle line:84%
Here is where the alchemical
transmutation starts to begin.

00:04:44.400 --> 00:04:48.660 align:middle line:84%
It's here inside the
solar plexus region

00:04:48.660 --> 00:04:55.650 align:middle line:84%
that now we are looking at this
sacred secretion as the seeds.

00:04:55.650 --> 00:05:01.660 align:middle line:84%
And these seeds are meant to be
nourished, purified, alchemized,

00:05:01.660 --> 00:05:04.840 align:middle line:90%
and transmuted.

00:05:04.840 --> 00:05:08.170 align:middle line:10%
This alchemy that takes place
inside the sacral chakra

00:05:08.170 --> 00:05:12.070 align:middle line:10%
was also known in
ancient yogic traditions

00:05:12.070 --> 00:05:16.210 align:middle line:10%
through the water
element and the fire

00:05:16.210 --> 00:05:19.960 align:middle line:10%
element of soma and agni.

00:05:19.960 --> 00:05:24.200 align:middle line:84%
Soma corresponds to
the etheric substance.

00:05:24.200 --> 00:05:27.910 align:middle line:84%
This is the actual
anointed secretions.

00:05:27.910 --> 00:05:32.360 align:middle line:84%
While agni corresponds
to the fire element.

00:05:32.360 --> 00:05:38.860 align:middle line:10%
According to alchemical lore,
we all contain dormant fire

00:05:38.860 --> 00:05:42.250 align:middle line:10%
within our bodily tissue,
and that is really

00:05:42.250 --> 00:05:45.980 align:middle line:10%
what this agni or
fire element is.

00:05:45.980 --> 00:05:51.460 align:middle line:84%
It is our own hidden ability
to activate and transmute

00:05:51.460 --> 00:05:56.530 align:middle line:84%
this sacred fluid through
our own physiological

00:05:56.530 --> 00:05:59.760 align:middle line:90%
and spiritual process.

00:05:59.760 --> 00:06:02.880 align:middle line:84%
This is the transformative
element that

00:06:02.880 --> 00:06:05.940 align:middle line:90%
meets inside the sacral chakra.

00:06:05.940 --> 00:06:09.120 align:middle line:84%
This is the whole
part now that requires

00:06:09.120 --> 00:06:14.080 align:middle line:84%
our participation and our
practice in order to ignite it.

00:06:14.080 --> 00:06:18.480 align:middle line:84%
And how we do that is through
breathwork practices that

00:06:18.480 --> 00:06:21.300 align:middle line:84%
are all heart-based
and all ones that

00:06:21.300 --> 00:06:26.370 align:middle line:84%
are very located in activating
through the fire and air

00:06:26.370 --> 00:06:29.130 align:middle line:84%
elements within
the sacral chakra.

00:06:29.130 --> 00:06:32.860 align:middle line:84%
And it doesn't only have
to be breathwork practices.

00:06:32.860 --> 00:06:35.280 align:middle line:84%
I really want to
emphasize here now

00:06:35.280 --> 00:06:39.960 align:middle line:84%
our own conscious and
unique participation

00:06:39.960 --> 00:06:41.770 align:middle line:90%
within this process.

00:06:41.770 --> 00:06:45.390 align:middle line:84%
We can fast during it,
or we can make sure

00:06:45.390 --> 00:06:49.890 align:middle line:84%
that we stay away from really
low-grade-quality foods

00:06:49.890 --> 00:06:55.590 align:middle line:84%
and low-grade-quality
information and media.

00:06:55.590 --> 00:06:58.480 align:middle line:84%
There are so many
different ways that we

00:06:58.480 --> 00:07:02.440 align:middle line:84%
would be able to
activate and participate

00:07:02.440 --> 00:07:05.840 align:middle line:84%
with this alchemical
process that's taking place,

00:07:05.840 --> 00:07:10.280 align:middle line:84%
but it's going to need to be
intentional and personalized.

00:07:10.280 --> 00:07:13.450 align:middle line:84%
It's very important
during this whole process

00:07:13.450 --> 00:07:17.650 align:middle line:84%
that while we're having
the sacred fluid descend

00:07:17.650 --> 00:07:22.600 align:middle line:84%
into the sacral chakra,
we create a closed circuit

00:07:22.600 --> 00:07:25.420 align:middle line:84%
from the tip of
our tongue, and we

00:07:25.420 --> 00:07:27.910 align:middle line:84%
place it all the way
to the soft palate

00:07:27.910 --> 00:07:30.260 align:middle line:84%
in the back of the
roof of our mouth

00:07:30.260 --> 00:07:33.220 align:middle line:84%
because this is what closes
that energetic circuit

00:07:33.220 --> 00:07:36.740 align:middle line:90%
and becomes the etherization.

00:07:36.740 --> 00:07:40.030 align:middle line:84%
It becomes that fire
element's capacity

00:07:40.030 --> 00:07:43.960 align:middle line:84%
through that closed
circuit to then transmute

00:07:43.960 --> 00:07:48.470 align:middle line:84%
the sacred fluid into the
secretion and into the seeds.

00:07:48.470 --> 00:07:51.610 align:middle line:84%
Obviously, that's not for
if you're going to bed

00:07:51.610 --> 00:07:55.130 align:middle line:84%
or if you're doing something
that's very functional,

00:07:55.130 --> 00:08:00.820 align:middle line:84%
but it's something to keep
in mind the whole time.

00:08:00.820 --> 00:08:04.360 align:middle line:84%
Now that we have
these seeds, which

00:08:04.360 --> 00:08:07.720 align:middle line:84%
is at this point
known as the chrism,

00:08:07.720 --> 00:08:12.100 align:middle line:84%
this chrism goes on
its ascent pathway

00:08:12.100 --> 00:08:15.970 align:middle line:84%
through the spinal column and
through the cerebral spinal

00:08:15.970 --> 00:08:20.930 align:middle line:84%
fluid, back, and it once again
reaches the heart center.

00:08:20.930 --> 00:08:23.540 align:middle line:90%
It is once again purified.

00:08:23.540 --> 00:08:28.660 align:middle line:84%
It is purified now through a
more mystical and even more

00:08:28.660 --> 00:08:31.250 align:middle line:84%
esoteric version
of the heart center

00:08:31.250 --> 00:08:36.985 align:middle line:84%
because now, the heart center is
acting as an alchemical furnace.

00:08:36.985 --> 00:08:40.450 align:middle line:84%
So once we've participated
in the descent

00:08:40.450 --> 00:08:45.950 align:middle line:84%
and the transmutation of this
seed in our sacral chakra,

00:08:45.950 --> 00:08:49.600 align:middle line:84%
we have now activated an
even deeper and more potent

00:08:49.600 --> 00:08:52.940 align:middle line:84%
layer of this
alchemical furnace.

00:08:52.940 --> 00:08:59.030 align:middle line:84%
And this is done mainly through
opening and expanding our heart

00:08:59.030 --> 00:09:04.970 align:middle line:84%
center into a more ecstatic,
more compassionate, and a more

00:09:04.970 --> 00:09:06.480 align:middle line:90%
empathic state.

00:09:06.480 --> 00:09:08.510 align:middle line:84%
And this is why
people experience

00:09:08.510 --> 00:09:14.360 align:middle line:84%
a lot of positive and
even elevated mood states

00:09:14.360 --> 00:09:16.290 align:middle line:84%
while they're doing
this practice.

00:09:16.290 --> 00:09:19.550 align:middle line:84%
It's because the
heart center is now

00:09:19.550 --> 00:09:23.880 align:middle line:84%
being used as a
furnace to activate it,

00:09:23.880 --> 00:09:26.570 align:middle line:84%
even at a more deeper
and purified level

00:09:26.570 --> 00:09:31.565 align:middle line:84%
as it ascends back to
the base of the skull.

00:09:31.565 --> 00:09:34.460 align:middle line:84%
The esoteric meaning
of resurrection

00:09:34.460 --> 00:09:38.930 align:middle line:84%
is to raise this sacred oil
from the base consciousness

00:09:38.930 --> 00:09:42.270 align:middle line:84%
within the sacrum,
up the spinal cord,

00:09:42.270 --> 00:09:45.350 align:middle line:84%
and into heaven,
which is the head.

00:09:45.350 --> 00:09:48.630 align:middle line:84%
Once this chrism reaches
the base of the skull,

00:09:48.630 --> 00:09:51.750 align:middle line:84%
it is now at the location
of crucification,

00:09:51.750 --> 00:09:56.470 align:middle line:84%
known as calvary in Latin
or as golgotha in Aramaic.

00:09:56.470 --> 00:10:00.460 align:middle line:84%
But the esoteric meaning of
crucification is not to torture.

00:10:00.460 --> 00:10:04.140 align:middle line:84%
It is to amplify the
potency of this oil

00:10:04.140 --> 00:10:08.280 align:middle line:84%
by fixing it here for two
and a half days where it

00:10:08.280 --> 00:10:11.100 align:middle line:90%
gestates before it is reborn.

00:10:11.100 --> 00:10:15.750 align:middle line:84%
This is what it really
means to be born again.

00:10:15.750 --> 00:10:20.880 align:middle line:84%
So this process of
descent and ascent

00:10:20.880 --> 00:10:26.940 align:middle line:84%
of this anointed oil into a
more glorified and more purified

00:10:26.940 --> 00:10:31.020 align:middle line:84%
form, this is its
esoteric meaning.

00:10:31.020 --> 00:10:35.430 align:middle line:84%
In exoteric terminology,
this is also

00:10:35.430 --> 00:10:42.450 align:middle line:84%
known as the Christian tale of
the ascent and descent of Jesus.

00:10:42.450 --> 00:10:46.560 align:middle line:84%
I want to pull you in deeper
so that we can actually

00:10:46.560 --> 00:10:51.700 align:middle line:84%
see that this process we
all hold the capability of.

00:10:51.700 --> 00:10:54.060 align:middle line:84%
This is an alchemy
that each one of us

00:10:54.060 --> 00:10:57.740 align:middle line:84%
contain if we're
truly looking at this

00:10:57.740 --> 00:10:59.725 align:middle line:90%
through the esoteric sphere.

00:10:59.725 --> 00:11:03.980 align:middle line:90%


00:11:03.980 --> 00:11:07.100 align:middle line:84%
After this anointed
oil has been crucified

00:11:07.100 --> 00:11:09.590 align:middle line:84%
at the base of
the skull, it then

00:11:09.590 --> 00:11:12.050 align:middle line:84%
makes its way to
the crown center

00:11:12.050 --> 00:11:15.530 align:middle line:84%
or the optic thalamus,
which is known

00:11:15.530 --> 00:11:18.290 align:middle line:90%
as the lights of the world.

00:11:18.290 --> 00:11:22.190 align:middle line:84%
And it is here
where we see it now

00:11:22.190 --> 00:11:26.250 align:middle line:84%
go one step further
to the pineal gland.

00:11:26.250 --> 00:11:32.240 align:middle line:84%
And this is where the higher
self and the lower self merge.

00:11:32.240 --> 00:11:34.400 align:middle line:84%
Once it's at the
pineal gland, it

00:11:34.400 --> 00:11:37.370 align:middle line:84%
has full regenerative
properties,

00:11:37.370 --> 00:11:39.830 align:middle line:84%
and these regenerative
properties

00:11:39.830 --> 00:11:43.850 align:middle line:90%
are meant to materialize spirit.

00:11:43.850 --> 00:11:46.530 align:middle line:84%
This is the true work
of the sacred secretion.

00:11:46.530 --> 00:11:48.740 align:middle line:90%
It is a regenerative process.

00:11:48.740 --> 00:11:53.480 align:middle line:84%
And the regeneration is done
through spiritualizing matter,

00:11:53.480 --> 00:12:00.040 align:middle line:84%
etherizing our material
form, and having our material

00:12:00.040 --> 00:12:04.700 align:middle line:84%
form embodied and integrated
more with our higher self.

00:12:04.700 --> 00:12:08.410 align:middle line:84%
That's probably one of the
most important and yet less

00:12:08.410 --> 00:12:11.450 align:middle line:84%
emphasized parts of
this whole practice.

00:12:11.450 --> 00:12:16.060 align:middle line:84%
It's the fact that having the
union between our higher self

00:12:16.060 --> 00:12:19.786 align:middle line:84%
and us is essentially what
creates the regeneration.

00:12:19.786 --> 00:12:23.170 align:middle line:90%


00:12:23.170 --> 00:12:28.130 align:middle line:84%
This whole practice is
available to us 12 times a year.

00:12:28.130 --> 00:12:32.650 align:middle line:10%
Each month, when the
moon is in our sun sign

00:12:32.650 --> 00:12:35.350 align:middle line:10%
that we were born
under, we now practice

00:12:35.350 --> 00:12:38.110 align:middle line:10%
this for two and a half days.

00:12:38.110 --> 00:12:40.960 align:middle line:84%
But to be honest,
I know many mystics

00:12:40.960 --> 00:12:45.700 align:middle line:84%
that give a two-day grace period
before the moon is in their sun

00:12:45.700 --> 00:12:49.100 align:middle line:84%
sign and after the moon
is in their sun sign.

00:12:49.100 --> 00:12:52.810 align:middle line:84%
So that would be two days
before, two days after.

00:12:52.810 --> 00:12:56.630 align:middle line:84%
I've even heard of people
extending this whole practice

00:12:56.630 --> 00:12:58.320 align:middle line:90%
out into a week.

00:12:58.320 --> 00:13:01.250 align:middle line:84%
So I really want you
to make this your own

00:13:01.250 --> 00:13:05.670 align:middle line:84%
and imbue it with your
own unique participation

00:13:05.670 --> 00:13:09.410 align:middle line:84%
because now, when we get to
the part where we're looking at

00:13:09.410 --> 00:13:12.980 align:middle line:84%
and discerning what is a
high-vibrational activity

00:13:12.980 --> 00:13:15.570 align:middle line:84%
versus a low-vibrational
activity,

00:13:15.570 --> 00:13:19.130 align:middle line:84%
it's really going to be based
a lot about what you personally

00:13:19.130 --> 00:13:20.540 align:middle line:90%
feel.

00:13:20.540 --> 00:13:24.770 align:middle line:84%
But there's some things that
are really kind of obvious that

00:13:24.770 --> 00:13:26.702 align:middle line:84%
are low-vibrational
and some things that

00:13:26.702 --> 00:13:28.160 align:middle line:84%
are really kind of
obvious that are

00:13:28.160 --> 00:13:33.380 align:middle line:84%
high-vibrational, such as
low-vibrational beliefs,

00:13:33.380 --> 00:13:39.030 align:middle line:84%
or low-vibrational thoughts,
low-vibrational content,

00:13:39.030 --> 00:13:43.140 align:middle line:84%
low-vibrational food, or
low-vibrational practices,

00:13:43.140 --> 00:13:46.010 align:middle line:84%
anything that we feel
like is of a base

00:13:46.010 --> 00:13:51.230 align:middle line:84%
nature versus positive
and high-vibrational news,

00:13:51.230 --> 00:13:54.970 align:middle line:84%
and high-vibrational practices,
and high-vibrational food.

00:13:54.970 --> 00:13:59.290 align:middle line:84%
There are some things that this
practice of the sacred secretion

00:13:59.290 --> 00:14:02.170 align:middle line:84%
is very strongly
connected to, and that

00:14:02.170 --> 00:14:06.380 align:middle line:84%
is one that abstains from
sexual activity during it.

00:14:06.380 --> 00:14:09.673 align:middle line:84%
And that's a very important part
of the transmutative process.

00:14:09.673 --> 00:14:13.990 align:middle line:90%


00:14:13.990 --> 00:14:18.910 align:middle line:84%
So how did the sacred
secretion become so popular

00:14:18.910 --> 00:14:21.370 align:middle line:90%
within the spirit of this age?

00:14:21.370 --> 00:14:26.420 align:middle line:84%
It's because it is the
embodiment of healing.

00:14:26.420 --> 00:14:28.810 align:middle line:84%
When we think of the
central themes that

00:14:28.810 --> 00:14:30.980 align:middle line:84%
are core to a
spiritual awakening,

00:14:30.980 --> 00:14:34.290 align:middle line:84%
we think of regeneration
and embodiment.

00:14:34.290 --> 00:14:38.020 align:middle line:84%
This is the actual practice
that is available to all of us

00:14:38.020 --> 00:14:40.940 align:middle line:90%
for free to be able to do that.

00:14:40.940 --> 00:14:46.450 align:middle line:84%
It is spiritual awakening
in physiological form.

00:14:46.450 --> 00:14:50.320 align:middle line:84%
So by participating in this,
what we're really doing

00:14:50.320 --> 00:14:56.090 align:middle line:84%
is healing as we are awakening
and embodying our higher

00:14:56.090 --> 00:14:59.060 align:middle line:90%
self in physical form.

00:14:59.060 --> 00:15:01.190 align:middle line:84%
This is the alchemical
practice that

00:15:01.190 --> 00:15:07.700 align:middle line:84%
supports that personal
evolution to enlightenment.

00:15:07.700 --> 00:15:12.210 align:middle line:84%
By consciously activating and
ascending the sacred secretion,

00:15:12.210 --> 00:15:15.650 align:middle line:84%
you initiate an
alchemical transformation

00:15:15.650 --> 00:15:19.760 align:middle line:84%
that regenerates your
mind, body, and spirit,

00:15:19.760 --> 00:15:24.965 align:middle line:84%
awakening a divine
connection from within.

00:15:24.965 --> 00:15:28.550 align:middle line:84%
This sacred fluid, when
properly cultivated,

00:15:28.550 --> 00:15:31.940 align:middle line:84%
holds the power to
transcend your limitations

00:15:31.940 --> 00:15:34.850 align:middle line:90%
and unlock your higher self.

00:15:34.850 --> 00:15:37.290 align:middle line:90%
The transformation is real.

00:15:37.290 --> 00:15:41.090 align:middle line:84%
Step into your spiritual
power and become

00:15:41.090 --> 00:15:44.600 align:middle line:90%
the alchemist of your own life.
