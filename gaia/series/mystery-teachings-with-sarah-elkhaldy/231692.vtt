>>SARAH ELKHALDY:
I'm Sarah Elkhaldy,

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:13.020 align:middle line:90%
and this is Mystery Teachings.

00:00:13.020 --> 00:00:16.790 align:middle line:90%


00:00:16.790 --> 00:00:20.210 align:middle line:10%
What if humanity stands
at a crossroads with two

00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:22.260 align:middle line:10%
divergent futures ahead--

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:26.330 align:middle line:10%
one of ascension, the
other of dissension.

00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:30.090 align:middle line:84%
The timeline split is not
just a theoretical concept.

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:33.800 align:middle line:84%
It's a battle between
love and fear.

00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:38.030 align:middle line:84%
A choice we make every day that
will determine which reality

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:40.070 align:middle line:90%
we experience.

00:00:40.070 --> 00:00:42.870 align:middle line:84%
Which timeline are
you aligning with?

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:48.770 align:middle line:84%
Higher consciousness or the
descent into fragmentation?

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:51.720 align:middle line:84%
The concept of a timeline
split is not new,

00:00:51.720 --> 00:00:54.350 align:middle line:84%
and it did not originate
within this age.

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:59.360 align:middle line:84%
Esoteric knowledge has always
known that timelines bifurcate.

00:00:59.360 --> 00:01:02.960 align:middle line:84%
In the spirit of this age, the
bifurcation of the timelines

00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:05.810 align:middle line:84%
is known as the ascending
timelines, which

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:09.140 align:middle line:84%
represent a future where
humanity evolves and grows

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:11.390 align:middle line:84%
in our consciousness
and has a higher

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:16.190 align:middle line:84%
vibration, versus the
descension timelines, where

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:19.700 align:middle line:84%
the future of humanity
devolves, and it

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:24.710 align:middle line:84%
goes into a fragmentation state,
which produces a lower vibratory

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:26.330 align:middle line:90%
rate.

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:30.590 align:middle line:84%
So many times we can project a
lot of our own personal beliefs

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:35.630 align:middle line:84%
onto this grand splitting of
timelines and upon our ascension

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:41.270 align:middle line:84%
and upon our descension when in
actuality the ascension process

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:45.230 align:middle line:84%
into more positive timelines
that all reflect a higher

00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:48.950 align:middle line:84%
vibratory rate is
not based on anything

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:52.790 align:middle line:84%
that has to do with there being
some sort of dogma or belief

00:01:52.790 --> 00:01:54.410 align:middle line:90%
system.

00:01:54.410 --> 00:01:59.210 align:middle line:84%
Instead, this is strictly
a matter of curriculum.

00:01:59.210 --> 00:02:03.180 align:middle line:84%
If the highest truth is
one of unconditional love,

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:07.190 align:middle line:84%
then the universe is just
giving us our next step

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:08.699 align:middle line:90%
in our own evolution.

00:02:08.699 --> 00:02:11.670 align:middle line:84%
And that's what ascension
is really about.

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:14.930 align:middle line:84%
It is about, what
is the next level

00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:19.490 align:middle line:84%
of lessons and our curriculum
that will best serve us?

00:02:19.490 --> 00:02:22.730 align:middle line:84%
What is that environment
that will best

00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:27.050 align:middle line:84%
help us learn the next
lesson in love and the lower

00:02:27.050 --> 00:02:31.280 align:middle line:84%
timelines for humanity, the
ones that represent degeneration

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:33.540 align:middle line:90%
and separation consciousness?

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:35.280 align:middle line:90%
It's not a punishment.

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:40.220 align:middle line:84%
Instead, what it's showing
us is our own consciousness

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:43.216 align:middle line:84%
and what will best serve
its own curriculum.

00:02:43.216 --> 00:02:46.070 align:middle line:90%


00:02:46.070 --> 00:02:50.510 align:middle line:84%
The descending timelines are
all rooted in fragmentation

00:02:50.510 --> 00:02:52.760 align:middle line:90%
and in disintegration.

00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:57.250 align:middle line:84%
This is the metaphysical
force that we know as entropy.

00:02:57.250 --> 00:02:59.860 align:middle line:84%
Entropy is a very
strong catalyst,

00:02:59.860 --> 00:03:02.320 align:middle line:84%
because what its
true purpose is,

00:03:02.320 --> 00:03:06.700 align:middle line:84%
is to take apart our
own consciousness

00:03:06.700 --> 00:03:09.400 align:middle line:90%
and then to expand it.

00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:12.580 align:middle line:84%
But this expansion
process isn't always one

00:03:12.580 --> 00:03:14.620 align:middle line:90%
that we participate in.

00:03:14.620 --> 00:03:20.120 align:middle line:84%
So even though entropy can be
a force for our own evolution,

00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:23.210 align:middle line:84%
it can just as much
lead us deep into chaos

00:03:23.210 --> 00:03:26.080 align:middle line:84%
if how it acts on
our consciousness

00:03:26.080 --> 00:03:31.630 align:middle line:84%
is through more fragmentation
and more disintegration.

00:03:31.630 --> 00:03:34.750 align:middle line:84%
Entropy has been
dissected and studied

00:03:34.750 --> 00:03:37.040 align:middle line:90%
throughout all of history.

00:03:37.040 --> 00:03:40.510 align:middle line:10%
When we look at Rupert
Sheldrake's work on entropy

00:03:40.510 --> 00:03:45.170 align:middle line:10%
in the nonphysical realm
and the nonvisible form,

00:03:45.170 --> 00:03:48.490 align:middle line:10%
the energy of entropy
is highly chaotic,

00:03:48.490 --> 00:03:50.980 align:middle line:10%
and it's highly disorganized.

00:03:50.980 --> 00:03:55.180 align:middle line:84%
So it's even more in
a state of confusion.

00:03:55.180 --> 00:03:58.510 align:middle line:84%
The more that this
state of confusion

00:03:58.510 --> 00:04:01.000 align:middle line:84%
and this state of
disorganization

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:06.320 align:middle line:84%
happens in the energetic
field, in the physical realm,

00:04:06.320 --> 00:04:10.060 align:middle line:84%
that thing that entropy
is acting upon actually

00:04:10.060 --> 00:04:13.010 align:middle line:90%
bears an inverse relationship.

00:04:13.010 --> 00:04:15.670 align:middle line:84%
The thing that
entropy is acting upon

00:04:15.670 --> 00:04:20.570 align:middle line:84%
becomes more ordered
and more crystallized.

00:04:20.570 --> 00:04:22.790 align:middle line:90%
It becomes more physical.

00:04:22.790 --> 00:04:27.550 align:middle line:84%
So entropy actually acts
as the converter of energy

00:04:27.550 --> 00:04:30.850 align:middle line:90%
into physical form.

00:04:30.850 --> 00:04:34.870 align:middle line:84%
The second law of thermodynamics
says that entropy always

00:04:34.870 --> 00:04:36.700 align:middle line:90%
increases with time.

00:04:36.700 --> 00:04:40.720 align:middle line:84%
But entropy does not
always produce chaos.

00:04:40.720 --> 00:04:43.070 align:middle line:90%
Entropy is more like a marker.

00:04:43.070 --> 00:04:45.940 align:middle line:84%
It is a measure of the
number of different ways

00:04:45.940 --> 00:04:48.920 align:middle line:84%
that a set of objects
can rearrange.

00:04:48.920 --> 00:04:53.420 align:middle line:84%
So entropy is what fuels cell
division and timeline division,

00:04:53.420 --> 00:04:58.510 align:middle line:84%
because entropy is
what fuels expansion.

00:04:58.510 --> 00:05:03.790 align:middle line:84%
So if entropy is meant to
expand our consciousness

00:05:03.790 --> 00:05:07.070 align:middle line:84%
and this expansion
can lead to chaos,

00:05:07.070 --> 00:05:11.080 align:middle line:84%
then it is the metaphysical
force of centropy that

00:05:11.080 --> 00:05:15.250 align:middle line:90%
creates order from that chaos.

00:05:15.250 --> 00:05:19.160 align:middle line:10%
So entropy would be known as
the metaphysical force of chaos,

00:05:19.160 --> 00:05:21.580 align:middle line:10%
and its counterpart,
centropy, would

00:05:21.580 --> 00:05:25.930 align:middle line:10%
be known as the
metaphysical force of order.

00:05:25.930 --> 00:05:30.160 align:middle line:84%
Humanity itself is always
going through this contraction

00:05:30.160 --> 00:05:33.830 align:middle line:84%
and this expansion, but
it needs a catalyst.

00:05:33.830 --> 00:05:37.570 align:middle line:10%
And this catalyst that
turns chaos into true order

00:05:37.570 --> 00:05:42.670 align:middle line:10%
and into higher
timelines is free will.

00:05:42.670 --> 00:05:46.330 align:middle line:84%
Free will is the key factor
in determining whether we

00:05:46.330 --> 00:05:48.950 align:middle line:90%
will evolve or devolve.

00:05:48.950 --> 00:05:52.750 align:middle line:84%
And free will is our
conscious participation

00:05:52.750 --> 00:05:56.140 align:middle line:90%
in our own evolution.

00:05:56.140 --> 00:05:58.550 align:middle line:90%
Free will is not a given.

00:05:58.550 --> 00:06:01.030 align:middle line:84%
It is a tiny kernel
within us that we

00:06:01.030 --> 00:06:04.760 align:middle line:84%
are meant to acknowledge
and then develop.

00:06:04.760 --> 00:06:10.210 align:middle line:84%
When we develop free will, that
transforms into higher levels

00:06:10.210 --> 00:06:11.770 align:middle line:90%
of consciousness.

00:06:11.770 --> 00:06:14.690 align:middle line:84%
And in these higher
levels of consciousness,

00:06:14.690 --> 00:06:17.390 align:middle line:90%
we can actually perceive more.

00:06:17.390 --> 00:06:21.560 align:middle line:84%
We can start integrating
multiple dimensions.

00:06:21.560 --> 00:06:25.750 align:middle line:84%
So free will is very vital in
this, because without it, we

00:06:25.750 --> 00:06:28.970 align:middle line:84%
get stuck in lower
states of consciousness.

00:06:28.970 --> 00:06:33.010 align:middle line:84%
We get trapped in separation
consciousness, where things

00:06:33.010 --> 00:06:38.050 align:middle line:84%
become predetermined and even
manipulated and programmed

00:06:38.050 --> 00:06:40.390 align:middle line:90%
in front of us.

00:06:40.390 --> 00:06:45.170 align:middle line:84%
The concept of a timeline split
can be very controversial,

00:06:45.170 --> 00:06:48.530 align:middle line:84%
simply because being a part
of the spiritual community,

00:06:48.530 --> 00:06:51.550 align:middle line:84%
we really are prone
to wanting to unify

00:06:51.550 --> 00:06:57.140 align:middle line:84%
and have unity consciousness be
one trajectory moving forward,

00:06:57.140 --> 00:07:00.800 align:middle line:84%
one whole timeline for
all of us to experience,

00:07:00.800 --> 00:07:04.150 align:middle line:84%
where we all experience the
benefits of positive and higher

00:07:04.150 --> 00:07:06.400 align:middle line:90%
states of being.

00:07:06.400 --> 00:07:11.560 align:middle line:84%
But the timeline split is
actually pointing to the fact

00:07:11.560 --> 00:07:14.300 align:middle line:90%
that we all have free will.

00:07:14.300 --> 00:07:16.960 align:middle line:90%
So it's not meant to divide.

00:07:16.960 --> 00:07:20.740 align:middle line:84%
It's meant to bring clarity
and even discernment to what

00:07:20.740 --> 00:07:22.840 align:middle line:90%
is already happening.

00:07:22.840 --> 00:07:27.100 align:middle line:84%
It's meant to understand
how timelines work.

00:07:27.100 --> 00:07:31.970 align:middle line:84%
So by understanding that
we're not causing division,

00:07:31.970 --> 00:07:35.900 align:middle line:84%
we're simply clarifying that
there is a division happening,

00:07:35.900 --> 00:07:38.860 align:middle line:84%
that brings us to
the full recognition

00:07:38.860 --> 00:07:43.660 align:middle line:84%
that what drives us into
higher timelines for reality

00:07:43.660 --> 00:07:47.510 align:middle line:84%
and into lower timelines
for reality is personal,

00:07:47.510 --> 00:07:49.455 align:middle line:84%
and it is based
on our free will.

00:07:49.455 --> 00:07:53.520 align:middle line:90%


00:07:53.520 --> 00:07:56.850 align:middle line:84%
The true nature of
time is cyclical.

00:07:56.850 --> 00:08:01.560 align:middle line:84%
Time appears to us as
linear, but it is cyclical.

00:08:01.560 --> 00:08:04.360 align:middle line:84%
This is why we have
different seasons.

00:08:04.360 --> 00:08:10.390 align:middle line:84%
The seasons are a representation
of time's cyclical nature.

00:08:10.390 --> 00:08:12.460 align:middle line:90%
But it doesn't stop there.

00:08:12.460 --> 00:08:16.000 align:middle line:84%
There are larger cycles
that we don't see,

00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:19.830 align:middle line:84%
and those cycles immerse
our consciousness

00:08:19.830 --> 00:08:25.210 align:middle line:84%
into an invisible spring,
summer, fall and winter,

00:08:25.210 --> 00:08:30.060 align:middle line:84%
or what we know as dark
ages and golden ages.

00:08:30.060 --> 00:08:33.960 align:middle line:84%
Why this is important is because
time in the third dimension

00:08:33.960 --> 00:08:35.740 align:middle line:90%
repeats itself.

00:08:35.740 --> 00:08:37.480 align:middle line:90%
It recycles.

00:08:37.480 --> 00:08:40.110 align:middle line:84%
It goes into denser
expressions, and it

00:08:40.110 --> 00:08:43.409 align:middle line:84%
goes into lighter
expressions, like the peaks

00:08:43.409 --> 00:08:45.990 align:middle line:90%
and the lows of a wave.

00:08:45.990 --> 00:08:49.740 align:middle line:84%
If a being has raised
their consciousness higher

00:08:49.740 --> 00:08:52.630 align:middle line:84%
than the field of
third-dimensional time,

00:08:52.630 --> 00:08:56.220 align:middle line:84%
they begin to start
in-training their frequency

00:08:56.220 --> 00:09:00.370 align:middle line:84%
into a completely different
version of space and time,

00:09:00.370 --> 00:09:02.970 align:middle line:84%
with experiences and
lessons that best

00:09:02.970 --> 00:09:05.730 align:middle line:90%
accommodate their frequency.

00:09:05.730 --> 00:09:08.950 align:middle line:84%
When a being has remembered
they are the creator,

00:09:08.950 --> 00:09:12.120 align:middle line:84%
their frequency will
begin to raise higher

00:09:12.120 --> 00:09:15.600 align:middle line:84%
than the options and
experiences that are currently

00:09:15.600 --> 00:09:19.770 align:middle line:84%
available within a collective
space-time that is still asleep.

00:09:19.770 --> 00:09:22.740 align:middle line:84%
So a major timeline
split would be

00:09:22.740 --> 00:09:25.290 align:middle line:84%
between all of the
collective consciousness that

00:09:25.290 --> 00:09:28.980 align:middle line:84%
is ready for a new curriculum
and has already mastered

00:09:28.980 --> 00:09:31.710 align:middle line:84%
the third-dimensional
curriculum,

00:09:31.710 --> 00:09:34.560 align:middle line:84%
versus all of the
collective consciousness

00:09:34.560 --> 00:09:37.170 align:middle line:84%
that would best be
served by continuing

00:09:37.170 --> 00:09:39.630 align:middle line:90%
to grow in the third dimension.

00:09:39.630 --> 00:09:43.800 align:middle line:84%
When this split happens,
it's called phaselock,

00:09:43.800 --> 00:09:46.080 align:middle line:84%
and a phase lock
is the real name

00:09:46.080 --> 00:09:49.170 align:middle line:84%
to what we are calling the split
between the third-dimensional

00:09:49.170 --> 00:09:52.660 align:middle line:84%
consciousness and the
fifth-dimensional consciousness.

00:09:52.660 --> 00:09:55.710 align:middle line:90%


00:09:55.710 --> 00:09:59.500 align:middle line:84%
Personal timeline shifts
happen all of the time.

00:09:59.500 --> 00:10:01.690 align:middle line:90%
They happen every day.

00:10:01.690 --> 00:10:04.710 align:middle line:84%
And what the difference between
a personal timeline shift

00:10:04.710 --> 00:10:10.770 align:middle line:84%
is versus a collective timeline
shift has to do with momentum.

00:10:10.770 --> 00:10:13.020 align:middle line:84%
In our personal
lives, we will always

00:10:13.020 --> 00:10:15.810 align:middle line:84%
be able to create
the reality that we

00:10:15.810 --> 00:10:19.870 align:middle line:84%
wish to experience by
making positive changes,

00:10:19.870 --> 00:10:23.910 align:middle line:84%
raising our frequency,
being more aware,

00:10:23.910 --> 00:10:26.310 align:middle line:84%
acting and interacting
with others

00:10:26.310 --> 00:10:28.530 align:middle line:90%
in a more conscious manner.

00:10:28.530 --> 00:10:30.630 align:middle line:84%
And that will all
be benefits that we

00:10:30.630 --> 00:10:33.180 align:middle line:90%
can experience immediately.

00:10:33.180 --> 00:10:36.390 align:middle line:84%
But collective
timeline shifts that

00:10:36.390 --> 00:10:39.660 align:middle line:84%
operate at a higher
frequency require

00:10:39.660 --> 00:10:42.300 align:middle line:90%
more collective momentum.

00:10:42.300 --> 00:10:46.650 align:middle line:84%
They require more of us to
be able to manifest that

00:10:46.650 --> 00:10:49.410 align:middle line:84%
timeline since there's
more people included

00:10:49.410 --> 00:10:52.380 align:middle line:84%
in that dimension and
there's more people

00:10:52.380 --> 00:10:55.530 align:middle line:90%
included in that reality.

00:10:55.530 --> 00:10:58.140 align:middle line:84%
So our personal
timelines, we will always

00:10:58.140 --> 00:11:02.280 align:middle line:84%
be able to have a lot more
agency in manifesting what

00:11:02.280 --> 00:11:05.880 align:middle line:84%
we wish to experience
with, simply because it's

00:11:05.880 --> 00:11:10.590 align:middle line:84%
about our personal
choices and our momentum,

00:11:10.590 --> 00:11:13.390 align:middle line:84%
whereas with major
timeline shifts,

00:11:13.390 --> 00:11:17.550 align:middle line:84%
those require collective
momentum behind them

00:11:17.550 --> 00:11:19.485 align:middle line:90%
and collective free will.

00:11:19.485 --> 00:11:22.025 align:middle line:90%


00:11:22.025 --> 00:11:25.630 align:middle line:84%
When we're going into higher
timelines for humanity,

00:11:25.630 --> 00:11:28.980 align:middle line:84%
these are also known
as ascension cycles.

00:11:28.980 --> 00:11:32.400 align:middle line:84%
And during an ascension
cycle, the veils

00:11:32.400 --> 00:11:35.860 align:middle line:84%
are thinner between humanity
and our higher self.

00:11:35.860 --> 00:11:41.490 align:middle line:84%
So we get a lot of spiritual
support and spiritual growth

00:11:41.490 --> 00:11:47.040 align:middle line:84%
by having thinner veils
within our own reality.

00:11:47.040 --> 00:11:50.910 align:middle line:84%
And this is then what produces
even more growth and even

00:11:50.910 --> 00:11:52.150 align:middle line:90%
more evolution.

00:11:52.150 --> 00:11:55.860 align:middle line:84%
So this cycle ends
up becoming a spiral.

00:11:55.860 --> 00:11:58.140 align:middle line:84%
And the descension
cycles can also

00:11:58.140 --> 00:12:01.330 align:middle line:84%
be looked at as a
descending spiral.

00:12:01.330 --> 00:12:05.850 align:middle line:10%
They are cycles where the
veils get heavier and denser

00:12:05.850 --> 00:12:11.400 align:middle line:10%
because there's more separation
between us and our higher self.

00:12:11.400 --> 00:12:15.850 align:middle line:84%
This separation creates
even more fragmentation.

00:12:15.850 --> 00:12:18.840 align:middle line:84%
And when that happens,
now we start getting

00:12:18.840 --> 00:12:23.400 align:middle line:90%
into deeper states of fear.

00:12:23.400 --> 00:12:26.370 align:middle line:84%
The descending
timelines for humanity

00:12:26.370 --> 00:12:29.850 align:middle line:84%
all have a core feature,
and that core feature

00:12:29.850 --> 00:12:35.010 align:middle line:84%
is, they all are operating
in the esoteric force called

00:12:35.010 --> 00:12:36.600 align:middle line:90%
coercion.

00:12:36.600 --> 00:12:40.440 align:middle line:84%
Coercion is what drives
the descending timelines.

00:12:40.440 --> 00:12:45.130 align:middle line:84%
Because the more that we go
into separation consciousness,

00:12:45.130 --> 00:12:48.780 align:middle line:84%
the more fear will
naturally be produced.

00:12:48.780 --> 00:12:52.190 align:middle line:84%
And whenever there is
fear that is strongly

00:12:52.190 --> 00:12:56.300 align:middle line:84%
present within the dominant
vibration of a collective, that

00:12:56.300 --> 00:13:00.800 align:middle line:84%
will lead to us forcing
ourselves onto one another

00:13:00.800 --> 00:13:06.660 align:middle line:84%
and inflicting our will and our
control onto another's will.

00:13:06.660 --> 00:13:10.640 align:middle line:84%
And how we can see this
manifest is through censorship

00:13:10.640 --> 00:13:12.890 align:middle line:90%
and thought police.

00:13:12.890 --> 00:13:15.270 align:middle line:84%
When we are in
separation consciousness,

00:13:15.270 --> 00:13:18.390 align:middle line:84%
we will naturally start
operating from fear,

00:13:18.390 --> 00:13:21.510 align:middle line:84%
and that will naturally
produce coercion,

00:13:21.510 --> 00:13:23.990 align:middle line:90%
which leads to control.

00:13:23.990 --> 00:13:29.940 align:middle line:84%
Fear, coercion, and control are
all extensions of one another.

00:13:29.940 --> 00:13:32.900 align:middle line:84%
They are all different
aspects of one another

00:13:32.900 --> 00:13:38.630 align:middle line:84%
that have in common
separation consciousness.

00:13:38.630 --> 00:13:41.210 align:middle line:84%
So if the descending
timelines are all

00:13:41.210 --> 00:13:44.400 align:middle line:84%
rooted in coercion,
fear, and separation,

00:13:44.400 --> 00:13:47.780 align:middle line:84%
then the ascending
timelines are operating

00:13:47.780 --> 00:13:52.940 align:middle line:84%
and rooted in love,
order, and freedom.

00:13:52.940 --> 00:13:58.020 align:middle line:84%
Whenever we allow others to have
their own personal free will

00:13:58.020 --> 00:14:02.000 align:middle line:84%
and whenever we respect
other people's choices to be

00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:05.600 align:middle line:84%
and however they wish to
exist, what we will see

00:14:05.600 --> 00:14:09.830 align:middle line:84%
is that that naturally
organizes harmony.

00:14:09.830 --> 00:14:13.550 align:middle line:90%
That harmony is called order.

00:14:13.550 --> 00:14:18.890 align:middle line:84%
So love has fruits, and those
fruits are freedom and order.

00:14:18.890 --> 00:14:22.010 align:middle line:84%
These three forces
of love, which

00:14:22.010 --> 00:14:25.470 align:middle line:84%
creates freedom,
which creates order,

00:14:25.470 --> 00:14:30.530 align:middle line:84%
are all the core features
of an ascending timeline.

00:14:30.530 --> 00:14:36.110 align:middle line:84%
So higher vibratory beings can't
remain in lower vibratory states

00:14:36.110 --> 00:14:40.640 align:middle line:84%
for long, because when we
have enough higher vibratory

00:14:40.640 --> 00:14:43.850 align:middle line:84%
beings, what that's going
to naturally produce

00:14:43.850 --> 00:14:47.030 align:middle line:84%
is some sort shift
in the external.

00:14:47.030 --> 00:14:49.160 align:middle line:84%
The shift in the
external will be

00:14:49.160 --> 00:14:54.410 align:middle line:84%
one that has to respond to
our higher vibratory state.

00:14:54.410 --> 00:14:58.970 align:middle line:84%
If the external is always a
reflection of our internal state

00:14:58.970 --> 00:15:01.940 align:middle line:84%
of consciousness, then
a whole collective

00:15:01.940 --> 00:15:05.570 align:middle line:84%
that is entering
higher vibratory states

00:15:05.570 --> 00:15:10.010 align:middle line:84%
will produce larger
impact and more potent

00:15:10.010 --> 00:15:12.780 align:middle line:90%
reflections of that environment.

00:15:12.780 --> 00:15:16.820 align:middle line:84%
So we will manifest
changes and shifts simply

00:15:16.820 --> 00:15:20.220 align:middle line:84%
because reality won't
be able to hold.

00:15:20.220 --> 00:15:26.330 align:middle line:84%
It won't be able to lock us
in to a lower state of reality

00:15:26.330 --> 00:15:30.200 align:middle line:84%
when we're operating at
a higher level of being.

00:15:30.200 --> 00:15:33.720 align:middle line:84%
So we will naturally
create a timeline split,

00:15:33.720 --> 00:15:38.600 align:middle line:84%
and we will naturally create
a whole collective new Earth

00:15:38.600 --> 00:15:42.466 align:middle line:84%
reality simply by
raising our vibration.

00:15:42.466 --> 00:15:45.170 align:middle line:90%


00:15:45.170 --> 00:15:48.780 align:middle line:84%
So when we're talking about
the ascending timelines,

00:15:48.780 --> 00:15:51.860 align:middle line:84%
this naturally means we
have to start addressing

00:15:51.860 --> 00:15:54.800 align:middle line:90%
what the ascension process is.

00:15:54.800 --> 00:15:58.710 align:middle line:84%
The ascension process
is done through healing.

00:15:58.710 --> 00:16:01.580 align:middle line:84%
What we're really doing when
we're talking about a higher

00:16:01.580 --> 00:16:05.150 align:middle line:84%
level of consciousness,
higher timelines,

00:16:05.150 --> 00:16:08.090 align:middle line:84%
we're talking about
a more healed version

00:16:08.090 --> 00:16:11.990 align:middle line:84%
of our own consciousness
and of reality.

00:16:11.990 --> 00:16:14.660 align:middle line:84%
This healing is a
holistic process

00:16:14.660 --> 00:16:18.900 align:middle line:84%
that takes place on the
mental, emotional, physical,

00:16:18.900 --> 00:16:22.890 align:middle line:84%
and spiritual levels of
our own energy field.

00:16:22.890 --> 00:16:27.930 align:middle line:84%
This is the inclusion of
every dimension of ourselves,

00:16:27.930 --> 00:16:31.100 align:middle line:84%
which is why the
ascension process talks so

00:16:31.100 --> 00:16:33.660 align:middle line:90%
much about multidimensionality.

00:16:33.660 --> 00:16:37.440 align:middle line:84%
We are not only one-dimensional,
and because of that,

00:16:37.440 --> 00:16:42.320 align:middle line:84%
this is a multidimensional
process that takes place.

00:16:42.320 --> 00:16:45.740 align:middle line:84%
This can also be one of
those tricky sweet spots

00:16:45.740 --> 00:16:48.950 align:middle line:84%
where we are sold
something that's

00:16:48.950 --> 00:16:51.540 align:middle line:84%
made to look like
it's progressive

00:16:51.540 --> 00:16:55.410 align:middle line:84%
and it's made to look like
we're on an ascension timeline.

00:16:55.410 --> 00:17:00.590 align:middle line:10%
And what we'll see with this
false ascension is beliefs that

00:17:00.590 --> 00:17:05.089 align:middle line:10%
are masquerading as movements,
and really what they're doing

00:17:05.089 --> 00:17:10.910 align:middle line:10%
is causing more division,
more fear, and more polarity.

00:17:10.910 --> 00:17:13.069 align:middle line:84%
This is what we have
to remember when

00:17:13.069 --> 00:17:15.200 align:middle line:90%
it comes to the timeline shift.

00:17:15.200 --> 00:17:18.530 align:middle line:84%
The ascension process
is done through healing.

00:17:18.530 --> 00:17:23.010 align:middle line:84%
It's not done through polarizing
and divisive movements.

00:17:23.010 --> 00:17:27.410 align:middle line:84%
A lot of times, we see movements
that have good meanings

00:17:27.410 --> 00:17:29.990 align:middle line:84%
and they're well-intended,
and then they

00:17:29.990 --> 00:17:33.380 align:middle line:84%
devolve quickly into
being inflammatory

00:17:33.380 --> 00:17:35.220 align:middle line:90%
and really aggressive.

00:17:35.220 --> 00:17:37.550 align:middle line:84%
And this is what we're
going to have to be really

00:17:37.550 --> 00:17:39.590 align:middle line:90%
mindful of and discerning.

00:17:39.590 --> 00:17:41.600 align:middle line:84%
Because the ascension
process is going

00:17:41.600 --> 00:17:46.280 align:middle line:84%
to be done through healing, and
healing is a uniting process.

00:17:46.280 --> 00:17:48.713 align:middle line:84%
It is not a divisive
and polarizing process.

00:17:48.713 --> 00:17:52.780 align:middle line:90%


00:17:52.780 --> 00:17:55.570 align:middle line:84%
Now, when a collective
finds themselves

00:17:55.570 --> 00:18:00.680 align:middle line:84%
in a group or a movement that's
headed towards polarization

00:18:00.680 --> 00:18:03.880 align:middle line:84%
but it meant well
and the people who

00:18:03.880 --> 00:18:06.280 align:middle line:84%
were involved with
that group in movement

00:18:06.280 --> 00:18:11.620 align:middle line:84%
actually had a deep intention
for healing and for higher

00:18:11.620 --> 00:18:14.260 align:middle line:84%
timelines for
humanity, the universe

00:18:14.260 --> 00:18:19.510 align:middle line:84%
enters with divine intervention
and gives us a grace period.

00:18:19.510 --> 00:18:23.860 align:middle line:84%
This grace period is for
us to be sectioned off

00:18:23.860 --> 00:18:27.650 align:middle line:84%
before we go into a
degenerative timeline,

00:18:27.650 --> 00:18:30.490 align:middle line:84%
because the universe
reads our intention.

00:18:30.490 --> 00:18:35.020 align:middle line:84%
And it is in this grace
period that time for increased

00:18:35.020 --> 00:18:39.730 align:middle line:84%
awareness and increased
consciousness is given to us,

00:18:39.730 --> 00:18:42.580 align:middle line:84%
so that we can reorient
ourselves and become

00:18:42.580 --> 00:18:45.890 align:middle line:84%
aware of what was
taking place within us.

00:18:45.890 --> 00:18:48.850 align:middle line:84%
So if what we see was
taking place within us was,

00:18:48.850 --> 00:18:53.080 align:middle line:84%
we had good intentions, but we
became a lot more polarizing,

00:18:53.080 --> 00:18:55.910 align:middle line:84%
and we became a lot
more fear-based,

00:18:55.910 --> 00:18:59.710 align:middle line:84%
even in our intention
of being loved based,

00:18:59.710 --> 00:19:02.860 align:middle line:84%
this grace period is
what gives us time

00:19:02.860 --> 00:19:06.920 align:middle line:84%
to heal and to align
our thoughts, feelings,

00:19:06.920 --> 00:19:10.690 align:middle line:84%
and actions with that
original intention,

00:19:10.690 --> 00:19:13.840 align:middle line:84%
and that original intention
being one of healing

00:19:13.840 --> 00:19:19.360 align:middle line:84%
and to progress into positive,
more empowering timelines.

00:19:19.360 --> 00:19:21.700 align:middle line:84%
When we start
healing and when we

00:19:21.700 --> 00:19:25.360 align:middle line:84%
start becoming more conscious,
sometimes our intention

00:19:25.360 --> 00:19:27.260 align:middle line:90%
can get ahead of ourselves.

00:19:27.260 --> 00:19:30.520 align:middle line:84%
When this happens,
we can accidentally

00:19:30.520 --> 00:19:35.350 align:middle line:84%
start going through a
spiritual bypassing process.

00:19:35.350 --> 00:19:38.440 align:middle line:84%
This is when we
want to heal and we

00:19:38.440 --> 00:19:42.470 align:middle line:84%
want to be a more mature and
evolved version of ourselves,

00:19:42.470 --> 00:19:44.380 align:middle line:90%
but it's a little too soon.

00:19:44.380 --> 00:19:48.910 align:middle line:84%
And we accidentally end up
denying parts of ourselves

00:19:48.910 --> 00:19:50.920 align:middle line:90%
and our own shadow.

00:19:50.920 --> 00:19:52.570 align:middle line:84%
When we do this,
what we're doing

00:19:52.570 --> 00:19:56.090 align:middle line:84%
is avoiding anything that's
uncomfortable within us,

00:19:56.090 --> 00:19:59.990 align:middle line:84%
and we're even extending
that to beyond us.

00:19:59.990 --> 00:20:02.950 align:middle line:84%
And we start avoiding
uncomfortable truths

00:20:02.950 --> 00:20:09.280 align:middle line:84%
that even lead further
into more stunted growth.

00:20:09.280 --> 00:20:12.460 align:middle line:84%
Now, this whole
timeline split is not

00:20:12.460 --> 00:20:15.260 align:middle line:84%
going to be visible
to the naked eye.

00:20:15.260 --> 00:20:19.060 align:middle line:84%
How it manifests is
always going to be

00:20:19.060 --> 00:20:22.990 align:middle line:84%
in a continuous
progression in either one

00:20:22.990 --> 00:20:27.740 align:middle line:84%
direction of evolution or the
other direction of de-evolution.

00:20:27.740 --> 00:20:31.570 align:middle line:84%
But we're not going to be
able to actually isolate

00:20:31.570 --> 00:20:35.560 align:middle line:84%
that one specific part
of reality where we see

00:20:35.560 --> 00:20:40.510 align:middle line:84%
the glitch that produces the
timeline split and many of us

00:20:40.510 --> 00:20:43.010 align:middle line:84%
want to see it, and we're
so excited to see it.

00:20:43.010 --> 00:20:46.900 align:middle line:84%
And we even regard it as
there being a large event that

00:20:46.900 --> 00:20:49.810 align:middle line:84%
then creates the
large glitch that we

00:20:49.810 --> 00:20:53.060 align:middle line:90%
need to split the timelines.

00:20:53.060 --> 00:20:57.370 align:middle line:84%
But actuality, it's going to
be incremental shifts that

00:20:57.370 --> 00:21:01.960 align:middle line:84%
take place before our very
eyes, because timelines

00:21:01.960 --> 00:21:04.430 align:middle line:90%
split all of the time.

00:21:04.430 --> 00:21:09.400 align:middle line:84%
So it's always going to be
a natural chaos and order,

00:21:09.400 --> 00:21:13.810 align:middle line:84%
a natural contraction and
expansion, that either moves us

00:21:13.810 --> 00:21:19.300 align:middle line:84%
into a more positive direction
or a more negative direction.

00:21:19.300 --> 00:21:21.640 align:middle line:84%
So these incremental
shifts that we're

00:21:21.640 --> 00:21:26.260 align:middle line:84%
going to be seeing inside
our larger external reality

00:21:26.260 --> 00:21:30.580 align:middle line:84%
are going to be through
phasing out and making

00:21:30.580 --> 00:21:33.190 align:middle line:84%
older systems that
represent separation

00:21:33.190 --> 00:21:37.360 align:middle line:84%
consciousness obsolete
through this phasing out.

00:21:37.360 --> 00:21:40.690 align:middle line:84%
For instance, if there
is an institution that

00:21:40.690 --> 00:21:43.390 align:middle line:84%
represents separation
consciousness, control,

00:21:43.390 --> 00:21:48.350 align:middle line:84%
and fear, that institution
we're going to see phased out.

00:21:48.350 --> 00:21:51.590 align:middle line:84%
It may not just crumble
before our very eyes.

00:21:51.590 --> 00:21:55.960 align:middle line:84%
Instead, what we'll see
is another institution

00:21:55.960 --> 00:21:59.440 align:middle line:84%
gets created from
unity consciousness.

00:21:59.440 --> 00:22:02.500 align:middle line:84%
And this institution
is one that makes

00:22:02.500 --> 00:22:08.890 align:middle line:84%
the outdated system, the one
that's based in fear, obsolete.

00:22:08.890 --> 00:22:10.870 align:middle line:84%
So what we're really
talking about when

00:22:10.870 --> 00:22:13.130 align:middle line:84%
we're talking about
a timeline split

00:22:13.130 --> 00:22:18.760 align:middle line:84%
is the manifestation of very
positive paradigm shifts

00:22:18.760 --> 00:22:22.360 align:middle line:84%
that are all making
the fear-based and

00:22:22.360 --> 00:22:26.800 align:middle line:84%
separation-consciousness-based
systems obsolete.

00:22:26.800 --> 00:22:32.530 align:middle line:84%
This phase-out is how
a new Earth is created.

00:22:32.530 --> 00:22:35.020 align:middle line:84%
So even though
positive solutions

00:22:35.020 --> 00:22:37.120 align:middle line:84%
and positive
structures are going

00:22:37.120 --> 00:22:41.180 align:middle line:84%
to be phasing out the
fear-based institutions,

00:22:41.180 --> 00:22:46.210 align:middle line:84%
we're still going to see tower
moments within the old paradigm.

00:22:46.210 --> 00:22:47.860 align:middle line:90%
It's unavoidable.

00:22:47.860 --> 00:22:50.960 align:middle line:84%
We're going to see some
level of destruction.

00:22:50.960 --> 00:22:52.900 align:middle line:90%
It will just vary.

00:22:52.900 --> 00:22:55.120 align:middle line:84%
And the reason why
it varies is it's

00:22:55.120 --> 00:22:59.920 align:middle line:84%
dependent on how attached
we are to those old systems.

00:22:59.920 --> 00:23:02.800 align:middle line:84%
The more attached we
are, the more destructive

00:23:02.800 --> 00:23:05.920 align:middle line:84%
and the more chaos
we'll experience.

00:23:05.920 --> 00:23:11.050 align:middle line:84%
The less attached we are to
the old paradigm, the more

00:23:11.050 --> 00:23:14.380 align:middle line:84%
that we're going to be
experiencing a lot more grace

00:23:14.380 --> 00:23:15.850 align:middle line:90%
and ease.

00:23:15.850 --> 00:23:19.970 align:middle line:84%
So the shifts will come
both startling and smoothly,

00:23:19.970 --> 00:23:24.160 align:middle line:84%
but each are a sign that we
are moving towards a new Earth.

00:23:24.160 --> 00:23:27.320 align:middle line:84%
Some of the shifts will
appear as miraculous,

00:23:27.320 --> 00:23:31.000 align:middle line:84%
but many of the shifts will
occur as energetic blocks being

00:23:31.000 --> 00:23:32.060 align:middle line:90%
lifted.

00:23:32.060 --> 00:23:34.480 align:middle line:84%
These blocks have
to do with actions

00:23:34.480 --> 00:23:38.170 align:middle line:84%
the collective wanted to take
to help build this new Earth.

00:23:38.170 --> 00:23:41.700 align:middle line:84%
If people had been experiencing
blocks in their projects

00:23:41.700 --> 00:23:44.350 align:middle line:84%
or contributions
to the new Earth,

00:23:44.350 --> 00:23:47.580 align:middle line:84%
they will start finding
more ease and flow.

00:23:47.580 --> 00:23:51.060 align:middle line:84%
And if beneficial tools
and models for society

00:23:51.060 --> 00:23:53.970 align:middle line:84%
were being held
back, those blocks,

00:23:53.970 --> 00:23:57.060 align:middle line:84%
too, will be lifted on
the new Earth timeline.

00:23:57.060 --> 00:24:00.400 align:middle line:84%
Wherever there was once
energetic barriers,

00:24:00.400 --> 00:24:02.700 align:middle line:90%
there will only be grace.

00:24:02.700 --> 00:24:05.950 align:middle line:84%
The timeline split is
not a distant prophecy.

00:24:05.950 --> 00:24:07.870 align:middle line:90%
It's happening right now.

00:24:07.870 --> 00:24:13.560 align:middle line:84%
And the choice to ascend or
descend lies within each of us.

00:24:13.560 --> 00:24:18.150 align:middle line:10%
As we elevate our consciousness,
we step into a reality

00:24:18.150 --> 00:24:22.920 align:middle line:10%
where love, unity, and
spiritual growth prevail.

00:24:22.920 --> 00:24:24.850 align:middle line:90%
The future is not written.

00:24:24.850 --> 00:24:28.850 align:middle line:84%
It's created by the
choices we make today.

00:24:28.850 --> 00:24:36.000 align:middle line:90%
