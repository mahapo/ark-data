Have you ever felt
disconnected from source,

00:00:21.410 --> 00:00:24.420 align:middle line:84%
as if your higher
self is out of reach,

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:29.510 align:middle line:84%
leaving you searching for
answers in all the wrong places?

00:00:29.510 --> 00:00:33.110 align:middle line:84%
The truth is, this
disconnection often

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:38.450 align:middle line:84%
stems from the imbalance between
the logical and intuitive sides

00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:43.340 align:middle line:84%
of your brain, blocking the
subtle messages that are always

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:45.590 align:middle line:90%
available to you.

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:49.880 align:middle line:10%
Can you learn to tune into
the quiet whispers of source

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:53.350 align:middle line:10%
and trust the divine guidance
that flows through you?

00:00:53.350 --> 00:00:56.210 align:middle line:90%


00:00:56.210 --> 00:00:59.110 align:middle line:84%
During a spiritual
awakening, we can often

00:00:59.110 --> 00:01:01.930 align:middle line:84%
feel disconnected from
our own higher power

00:01:01.930 --> 00:01:04.300 align:middle line:90%
and from our own intuition.

00:01:04.300 --> 00:01:07.570 align:middle line:84%
But this disconnection
is oftentimes

00:01:07.570 --> 00:01:10.780 align:middle line:84%
a gap between our own
left and right hemispheres

00:01:10.780 --> 00:01:13.030 align:middle line:90%
within our brain.

00:01:13.030 --> 00:01:15.010 align:middle line:10%
So the first step
to understanding

00:01:15.010 --> 00:01:17.290 align:middle line:10%
how to communicate
with source would

00:01:17.290 --> 00:01:21.040 align:middle line:10%
be to learn how to communicate
within the hemispheres

00:01:21.040 --> 00:01:27.100 align:middle line:10%
of our own brain, starting with
understanding our left brain.

00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:31.940 align:middle line:84%
The left brain is located
within space and time.

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:35.020 align:middle line:84%
And so it is what
we overidentify

00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:38.770 align:middle line:84%
with because it is the
analytical mind that

00:01:38.770 --> 00:01:44.110 align:middle line:84%
is here in this reality that
operates in this dimension.

00:01:44.110 --> 00:01:46.610 align:middle line:84%
It is also what we
know as the ego.

00:01:46.610 --> 00:01:49.520 align:middle line:90%
So the left brain is the logic.

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:51.290 align:middle line:90%
It is the reasoning.

00:01:51.290 --> 00:01:55.450 align:middle line:84%
It is the third dimensional
reality that we experience.

00:01:55.450 --> 00:01:57.700 align:middle line:84%
We come to become
more identified

00:01:57.700 --> 00:02:00.880 align:middle line:84%
with the left brain the
more that we grow up

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:03.320 align:middle line:84%
and the more that we
reach our adulthood.

00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:06.710 align:middle line:84%
So the more that we
have calcified our ego,

00:02:06.710 --> 00:02:10.009 align:middle line:84%
we become more rational
and more logical.

00:02:10.009 --> 00:02:11.780 align:middle line:90%
And this is all fine and well.

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:15.520 align:middle line:84%
But this is where the
disconnection begins.

00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:19.450 align:middle line:84%
Because we've become so
used to our identity that

00:02:19.450 --> 00:02:22.790 align:middle line:84%
is located here
in this dimension,

00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:26.720 align:middle line:84%
we start settling more and
more into this reality.

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:29.890 align:middle line:84%
And we have our beliefs
structured and sometimes

00:02:29.890 --> 00:02:31.450 align:middle line:90%
even programmed.

00:02:31.450 --> 00:02:35.320 align:middle line:84%
And all of this is taking
place within our left brain.

00:02:35.320 --> 00:02:39.010 align:middle line:84%
So we become very overidentified
with this experience

00:02:39.010 --> 00:02:40.340 align:middle line:90%
and with our ego.

00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:43.780 align:middle line:84%
And that ends up
becoming the very barrier

00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:46.260 align:middle line:84%
between our own
communication with source.

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:49.210 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:02:49.210 --> 00:02:54.140 align:middle line:84%
Now, the right brain is located
outside of space and time.

00:02:54.140 --> 00:02:58.380 align:middle line:84%
It is located outside
of this dimension.

00:02:58.380 --> 00:03:01.660 align:middle line:84%
The right brain connects
us to the transcendent,

00:03:01.660 --> 00:03:05.100 align:middle line:84%
to the psychic, and
even to the mystery

00:03:05.100 --> 00:03:08.730 align:middle line:84%
which all resides
beyond space and time.

00:03:08.730 --> 00:03:13.020 align:middle line:84%
So the right brain represents
source consciousness

00:03:13.020 --> 00:03:16.890 align:middle line:84%
and everything that is
beyond the ego, everything

00:03:16.890 --> 00:03:19.500 align:middle line:84%
that is a part of
our higher mind

00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:22.630 align:middle line:90%
and even imagination itself.

00:03:22.630 --> 00:03:28.440 align:middle line:84%
And this gets translated
into our inner light.

00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:30.840 align:middle line:84%
And this is the
most important thing

00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:34.210 align:middle line:84%
about understanding how to
communicate with source.

00:03:34.210 --> 00:03:39.240 align:middle line:84%
It's that the right brain
is the symbolic aspect that

00:03:39.240 --> 00:03:42.990 align:middle line:84%
dwells within all of
us that is emanating

00:03:42.990 --> 00:03:47.190 align:middle line:84%
the light of this world,
illuminating our reality

00:03:47.190 --> 00:03:50.460 align:middle line:90%
like a lantern in the dark.

The right brain being the
source of our own inner light

00:03:54.890 --> 00:04:00.020 align:middle line:10%
that emanates and even projects
this whole reality was known

00:04:00.020 --> 00:04:04.020 align:middle line:10%

the esoteric wisdom,

00:04:04.020 --> 00:04:05.640 align:middle line:10%
"Don't you know yet?

00:04:05.640 --> 00:04:08.190 align:middle line:10%
It is your light that
lights the world."

00:04:08.190 --> 00:04:11.330 align:middle line:84%
This inner light is what
brings psychic impressions

00:04:11.330 --> 00:04:13.860 align:middle line:90%
into our conscious reality.

00:04:13.860 --> 00:04:17.630 align:middle line:84%
But we often fail to perceive
this subtle communication

00:04:17.630 --> 00:04:23.678 align:middle line:84%
from source because the
left brain is too dominant.

00:04:24.950 --> 00:04:27.440 align:middle line:84%
The left hemisphere
of the brain is

00:04:27.440 --> 00:04:30.680 align:middle line:84%
connected to the right
hemisphere of the body.

00:04:30.680 --> 00:04:33.080 align:middle line:84%
And the left
hemisphere of the body

00:04:33.080 --> 00:04:37.400 align:middle line:84%
is connected to the right
hemisphere of the brain.

00:04:37.400 --> 00:04:40.070 align:middle line:84%
So the left hemisphere
of the brain

00:04:40.070 --> 00:04:44.570 align:middle line:84%
is the interface between
us and the inner light

00:04:44.570 --> 00:04:46.940 align:middle line:90%
of consciousness.

00:04:46.940 --> 00:04:50.270 align:middle line:84%
The left hemisphere is
our spiritual antenna

00:04:50.270 --> 00:04:53.540 align:middle line:84%
that receives the
signal and then converts

00:04:53.540 --> 00:04:57.650 align:middle line:84%
that signal into our
third-dimensional reality.

00:04:57.650 --> 00:05:01.260 align:middle line:84%
We think that light is
received from the external

00:05:01.260 --> 00:05:03.410 align:middle line:84%
and then is put
together to create

00:05:03.410 --> 00:05:06.320 align:middle line:90%
a vision from inside our brain.

00:05:06.320 --> 00:05:10.220 align:middle line:84%
But in reality, our own
inner light of consciousness

00:05:10.220 --> 00:05:12.510 align:middle line:90%
is what animates our reality.

00:05:12.510 --> 00:05:16.970 align:middle line:84%
And the outward light
is a reflection of that.

00:05:16.970 --> 00:05:19.130 align:middle line:84%
And this is very
important when it

00:05:19.130 --> 00:05:22.970 align:middle line:84%
comes to understanding
the first barrier

00:05:22.970 --> 00:05:25.400 align:middle line:84%
between our
communication with source

00:05:25.400 --> 00:05:28.520 align:middle line:84%
and how to dissolve
that barrier.

00:05:28.520 --> 00:05:31.670 align:middle line:84%
It's by understanding
this schism that's

00:05:31.670 --> 00:05:35.570 align:middle line:84%
taking place between the left
brain and the right brain,

00:05:35.570 --> 00:05:38.490 align:middle line:84%
one that is located
within space and time

00:05:38.490 --> 00:05:42.410 align:middle line:84%
and the other one that dwells
far beyond this dimension

00:05:42.410 --> 00:05:45.200 align:middle line:90%
and beyond space and time.

00:05:45.200 --> 00:05:50.690 align:middle line:84%
Now, the right brain has energy
that flows into the left brain.

00:05:50.690 --> 00:05:54.950 align:middle line:84%
And the right brain is always
connected to the left brain.

00:05:54.950 --> 00:05:58.300 align:middle line:84%
So this flow of
energy gets analyzed.

00:05:58.300 --> 00:06:02.830 align:middle line:84%
And it gets translated
through the left brain.

00:06:02.830 --> 00:06:06.370 align:middle line:84%
And so the left brain is
doing its best to always--

00:06:06.370 --> 00:06:11.470 align:middle line:84%
to interpret the psychic
projections of this light,

00:06:11.470 --> 00:06:16.630 align:middle line:84%
of this inner phenomenon
of source consciousness.

00:06:16.630 --> 00:06:22.760 align:middle line:84%
And it's always translating
this communication from source.

00:06:22.760 --> 00:06:26.390 align:middle line:90%
It's just not fully aware of it.

00:06:26.390 --> 00:06:31.780 align:middle line:84%
It can't fully believe
that source consciousness

00:06:31.780 --> 00:06:34.810 align:middle line:84%
and the inner light dwell
simply right next to it

00:06:34.810 --> 00:06:36.250 align:middle line:90%
in the right brain.

00:06:36.250 --> 00:06:42.040 align:middle line:84%
And so the left brain continues
to put limiting beliefs

00:06:42.040 --> 00:06:46.030 align:middle line:84%
on this communication
and distort

00:06:46.030 --> 00:06:48.720 align:middle line:84%
the signals that are
being transmitted

00:06:48.720 --> 00:06:50.170 align:middle line:90%
from the right brain.

00:06:50.170 --> 00:06:52.360 align:middle line:90%
And it's done very innocently.

00:06:52.360 --> 00:06:54.850 align:middle line:90%
But it's done all the time.

00:06:54.850 --> 00:06:58.470 align:middle line:84%
And we tend to ignore
any communication that's

00:06:58.470 --> 00:07:00.790 align:middle line:90%
coming from this inner light.

00:07:00.790 --> 00:07:06.120 align:middle line:84%
Because if we cannot perceive
a phenomenon directly and if we

00:07:06.120 --> 00:07:11.790 align:middle line:84%
cannot engage with it directly,
then we're bound to relate to it

00:07:11.790 --> 00:07:14.580 align:middle line:84%
through our own projections
and through our own limiting

00:07:14.580 --> 00:07:16.230 align:middle line:90%
beliefs.

00:07:16.230 --> 00:07:21.060 align:middle line:84%
And so this distance between
the left brain's capability

00:07:21.060 --> 00:07:24.660 align:middle line:84%
of truly receiving
and translating

00:07:24.660 --> 00:07:29.253 align:middle line:84%
the right brain's inner light is
where the dominant disconnection

00:07:29.253 --> 00:07:30.053 align:middle line:90%
lies.

00:07:30.053 --> 00:07:31.620 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:07:31.620 --> 00:07:35.640 align:middle line:84%
And so the second step to how
we can communicate with source

00:07:35.640 --> 00:07:40.060 align:middle line:84%
is going to ask us to
rewire our whole identity.

00:07:40.060 --> 00:07:42.300 align:middle line:84%
We must reorient
our identification

00:07:42.300 --> 00:07:47.130 align:middle line:84%
so that it includes both our
left and right hemispheres

00:07:47.130 --> 00:07:48.690 align:middle line:90%
of the brain.

00:07:48.690 --> 00:07:54.750 align:middle line:84%
So what we would need to do
is to relax the left brain's

00:07:54.750 --> 00:07:59.250 align:middle line:84%
identity and relax the
left brain's dominance

00:07:59.250 --> 00:08:01.840 align:middle line:90%
over our whole experience.

00:08:01.840 --> 00:08:03.810 align:middle line:84%
This is really
what's going to allow

00:08:03.810 --> 00:08:10.290 align:middle line:84%
us to start accessing more of
our capacity and more access

00:08:10.290 --> 00:08:12.960 align:middle line:90%
to our imagination.

00:08:12.960 --> 00:08:17.080 align:middle line:84%
The right brain is our
conduit for imagination.

00:08:17.080 --> 00:08:20.280 align:middle line:84%
So once the left
brain is able to start

00:08:20.280 --> 00:08:23.760 align:middle line:84%
merging with the
right brain, that's

00:08:23.760 --> 00:08:28.110 align:middle line:84%
going to start creating a
natural integration process.

00:08:28.110 --> 00:08:30.670 align:middle line:90%
Imagination is divine.

00:08:30.670 --> 00:08:34.870 align:middle line:84%
And it's just as real as our
reality and the left brain.

00:08:34.870 --> 00:08:39.940 align:middle line:84%
So imagination is
closely tied to spirit.

00:08:39.940 --> 00:08:42.179 align:middle line:84%
We could even say
that imagination

00:08:42.179 --> 00:08:44.280 align:middle line:90%
is source consciousness.

00:08:44.280 --> 00:08:49.100 align:middle line:84%
It's our higher mind because
we're all creative beings.

00:08:49.100 --> 00:08:52.880 align:middle line:84%
So when we relax
the left brain, this

00:08:52.880 --> 00:08:57.800 align:middle line:84%
helps us interpret imagination
as divine communication

00:08:57.800 --> 00:09:00.450 align:middle line:90%
and not just as random thoughts.

00:09:00.450 --> 00:09:03.560 align:middle line:10%
And we start validating
our imagination

00:09:03.560 --> 00:09:08.510 align:middle line:10%
as being just as valid and
just as real as our left brain.

00:09:08.510 --> 00:09:11.570 align:middle line:84%
And this brings us to
the next step of how

00:09:11.570 --> 00:09:13.082 align:middle line:90%
to communicate with source--

00:09:13.082 --> 00:09:13.882 align:middle line:90%
subtlety.

[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:09:15.680 --> 00:09:18.260 align:middle line:84%
Communication from
source will feel more

00:09:18.260 --> 00:09:21.720 align:middle line:90%
like silent and strong clarity.

00:09:21.720 --> 00:09:24.770 align:middle line:84%
It will be a clarity
around whatever

00:09:24.770 --> 00:09:26.810 align:middle line:84%
we feel we have a
lot of questions

00:09:26.810 --> 00:09:30.210 align:middle line:90%
about in that real time moment.

00:09:30.210 --> 00:09:35.960 align:middle line:84%
So many times, we're ignoring
very valid and very divine

00:09:35.960 --> 00:09:40.490 align:middle line:84%
communication from source,
simply because it's not bold

00:09:40.490 --> 00:09:42.880 align:middle line:84%
enough for our
nervous system, it

00:09:42.880 --> 00:09:46.730 align:middle line:84%
is not analytical enough
for the left brain,

00:09:46.730 --> 00:09:48.740 align:middle line:90%
it's not loud enough.

00:09:48.740 --> 00:09:52.630 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes, we feel that
communication isn't even valid

00:09:52.630 --> 00:09:56.230 align:middle line:84%
unless we see an angel
pound through our roof

00:09:56.230 --> 00:09:59.260 align:middle line:84%
and stand straight
in front of us.

00:09:59.260 --> 00:10:04.460 align:middle line:84%
But the right brain's inner
light is the subtle realms.

00:10:04.460 --> 00:10:08.450 align:middle line:84%
And in order to understand
and hear the subtle realms,

00:10:08.450 --> 00:10:11.920 align:middle line:84%
we now have to
become more subtle.

00:10:11.920 --> 00:10:14.230 align:middle line:90%
I cannot stress this enough.

00:10:14.230 --> 00:10:20.000 align:middle line:84%
To connect with source, we
must become subtle ourselves.

00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:23.110 align:middle line:84%
And we must develop
the subtleness

00:10:23.110 --> 00:10:28.270 align:middle line:84%
within our whole being to
receive the subtle messages that

00:10:28.270 --> 00:10:30.850 align:middle line:90%
come from the right brain.

00:10:30.850 --> 00:10:33.970 align:middle line:84%
And we have to start
understanding just how

00:10:33.970 --> 00:10:38.590 align:middle line:84%
much our own attunement
into the subtle realm

00:10:38.590 --> 00:10:41.560 align:middle line:84%
plays the strongest
role in our ability

00:10:41.560 --> 00:10:45.900 align:middle line:84%
to develop confidence in
receiving connection to source.

00:10:45.900 --> 00:10:48.290 align:middle line:90%


00:10:48.290 --> 00:10:49.090 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:10:49.090 --> 00:10:51.250 align:middle line:84%
The reason why
it's so hard for us

00:10:51.250 --> 00:10:53.680 align:middle line:84%
to believe that we can
communicate with source

00:10:53.680 --> 00:10:58.550 align:middle line:84%
is because we're usually
operating from the lower mind

00:10:58.550 --> 00:11:01.450 align:middle line:84%
or what is known
as the monkey mind.

00:11:01.450 --> 00:11:03.850 align:middle line:84%
This is the part of
our mind that includes

00:11:03.850 --> 00:11:06.740 align:middle line:90%
all of the unnecessary chatter.

00:11:06.740 --> 00:11:11.120 align:middle line:84%
And it clouds true
communication from source

00:11:11.120 --> 00:11:16.420 align:middle line:84%
because we're simply using the
monkey mind to continuously

00:11:16.420 --> 00:11:21.880 align:middle line:84%
perpetuate lower thoughts,
the same limiting

00:11:21.880 --> 00:11:25.450 align:middle line:84%
beliefs or the same
thought patterns that

00:11:25.450 --> 00:11:30.940 align:middle line:84%
keep us locked into the lower
frequencies of this experience.

00:11:30.940 --> 00:11:34.700 align:middle line:84%
The lower mind is where
we have the most judgment

00:11:34.700 --> 00:11:38.200 align:middle line:84%
and we're the most critical
of ourselves and others.

00:11:38.200 --> 00:11:41.770 align:middle line:84%
This is where we pick
apart all of our actions.

00:11:41.770 --> 00:11:45.360 align:middle line:84%
And this is what we constantly
replay over and over again

00:11:45.360 --> 00:11:48.270 align:middle line:84%
because we feel that
it is unresolved.

00:11:48.270 --> 00:11:51.630 align:middle line:84%
So this is so important to
understand about the lower

00:11:51.630 --> 00:11:55.560 align:middle line:84%
mind and the higher mind because
communication from source

00:11:55.560 --> 00:11:57.820 align:middle line:84%
is not happening
in the lower mind.

00:11:57.820 --> 00:12:00.870 align:middle line:84%
In fact, we would
need to really observe

00:12:00.870 --> 00:12:04.710 align:middle line:84%
the content of the monkey
mind and start peeling back

00:12:04.710 --> 00:12:08.490 align:middle line:84%
the layers and dissolving
that chatter in order

00:12:08.490 --> 00:12:10.920 align:middle line:84%
to start hearing
the thoughts that

00:12:10.920 --> 00:12:15.120 align:middle line:84%
are coming from source
consciousness and the higher

00:12:15.120 --> 00:12:16.530 align:middle line:90%
mind.

00:12:16.530 --> 00:12:20.160 align:middle line:84%
So the lower mind is going
to be one of the things

00:12:20.160 --> 00:12:23.820 align:middle line:84%
that we have to become aware of
because it's very easy for us

00:12:23.820 --> 00:12:27.690 align:middle line:84%
to understand why we would
mock the concept of thoughts

00:12:27.690 --> 00:12:32.490 align:middle line:84%
being divine or thoughts being
how source communicates to us

00:12:32.490 --> 00:12:39.800 align:middle line:84%
if our dominant location within
the mind is the lower mind.

00:12:39.800 --> 00:12:44.150 align:middle line:84%
We especially feel disconnected
from our own higher power

00:12:44.150 --> 00:12:47.960 align:middle line:84%
when we feel like we
are not worthy of being

00:12:47.960 --> 00:12:52.350 align:middle line:84%
close enough in distance
to our higher power.

00:12:52.350 --> 00:12:54.570 align:middle line:84%
And this is really
important to understand.

00:12:54.570 --> 00:12:59.390 align:middle line:84%
Because whenever we place
a large distance between us

00:12:59.390 --> 00:13:02.930 align:middle line:84%
and divinity, we
will always manifest

00:13:02.930 --> 00:13:07.740 align:middle line:84%
some sort of issue, some sort
of error in communication.

00:13:07.740 --> 00:13:10.520 align:middle line:90%
So distance is so important.

00:13:10.520 --> 00:13:12.980 align:middle line:84%
Because when we're
really talking

00:13:12.980 --> 00:13:16.310 align:middle line:84%
about higher mind
and the lower mind

00:13:16.310 --> 00:13:20.930 align:middle line:84%
or the higher self and even the
ego, what we're thinking about

00:13:20.930 --> 00:13:23.610 align:middle line:90%
is the above and the below.

00:13:23.610 --> 00:13:26.240 align:middle line:84%
But so that we
understand how to bridge

00:13:26.240 --> 00:13:30.020 align:middle line:84%
the gap between this distance,
what I want you to understand

00:13:30.020 --> 00:13:35.550 align:middle line:84%
is that the as above
and so below are real.

00:13:35.550 --> 00:13:38.390 align:middle line:84%
But they're real in
this realm, which

00:13:38.390 --> 00:13:41.000 align:middle line:90%
is based off of relativity.

00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:45.230 align:middle line:84%
Beyond space-time and
beyond relativity,

00:13:45.230 --> 00:13:51.230 align:middle line:84%
there's truly only as
within and so without.

00:13:51.230 --> 00:13:54.560 align:middle line:90%
So as above and so below.

00:13:54.560 --> 00:13:58.100 align:middle line:90%
As within, so without.

00:13:58.100 --> 00:14:01.820 align:middle line:90%
As the universe, so the soul.

00:14:01.820 --> 00:14:06.350 align:middle line:84%
This hermetic axiom is
pointing to the deeper truth

00:14:06.350 --> 00:14:08.840 align:middle line:84%
that there is no
distance between us

00:14:08.840 --> 00:14:10.640 align:middle line:90%
and source consciousness.

00:14:10.640 --> 00:14:16.040 align:middle line:84%
We are the universe experiencing
ourselves as a soul.

00:14:16.040 --> 00:14:21.210 align:middle line:84%
And so once we understand that
everything comes from within

00:14:21.210 --> 00:14:26.360 align:middle line:84%
and is projected from
within to the without,

00:14:26.360 --> 00:14:30.800 align:middle line:84%
we have now bridged the
distance between us and source,

00:14:30.800 --> 00:14:35.830 align:middle line:84%
between our analytical mind
and between our inner light.

00:14:35.830 --> 00:14:40.660 align:middle line:84%
"As within, so without" is
also known as the Vedic wisdom.

00:14:40.660 --> 00:14:46.600 align:middle line:10%
"He who knows that highest
Brahman becomes even Brahman."

00:14:46.600 --> 00:14:49.760 align:middle line:10%
This is what it means
to know thyself.

00:14:49.760 --> 00:14:54.280 align:middle line:84%
But this knowing can only come
once our mind is open enough

00:14:54.280 --> 00:14:57.130 align:middle line:84%
to receive a higher
level of being.

00:14:57.130 --> 00:15:03.640 align:middle line:84%
We must allow our mind to relax
into our heart to do this.

00:15:03.640 --> 00:15:08.170 align:middle line:84%
The brain can be looked at
as a spiritual antenna that

00:15:08.170 --> 00:15:12.170 align:middle line:84%
is dialing us into this
third-dimensional reality.

00:15:12.170 --> 00:15:16.960 align:middle line:84%
So the brain is always
translating vibration

00:15:16.960 --> 00:15:19.060 align:middle line:90%
into physical matter.

00:15:19.060 --> 00:15:22.150 align:middle line:84%
And the brain is
converting our imagination

00:15:22.150 --> 00:15:24.790 align:middle line:90%
into this physical reality.

00:15:24.790 --> 00:15:29.530 align:middle line:84%
So the brain is always
like an interface

00:15:29.530 --> 00:15:33.810 align:middle line:84%
translating and interpreting
even our thoughts

00:15:33.810 --> 00:15:36.390 align:middle line:90%
into physical form.

00:15:36.390 --> 00:15:39.420 align:middle line:84%
So if the brain is
the spiritual antenna,

00:15:39.420 --> 00:15:42.730 align:middle line:84%
then what is turning
the knob is the heart.

00:15:42.730 --> 00:15:47.760 align:middle line:84%
And the heart is what
allows us to go and dial

00:15:47.760 --> 00:15:51.240 align:middle line:84%
in on the wavelength,
just like a radio station,

00:15:51.240 --> 00:15:54.270 align:middle line:84%
to the channel where we're
getting communication

00:15:54.270 --> 00:15:56.400 align:middle line:90%
from source consciousness.

00:15:56.400 --> 00:16:01.540 align:middle line:84%
So source consciousness really
dwells within our heart.

00:16:01.540 --> 00:16:04.110 align:middle line:84%
And that's how we
even get on the radio

00:16:04.110 --> 00:16:08.460 align:middle line:84%
station or the wavelength
to perceive communication

00:16:08.460 --> 00:16:10.210 align:middle line:90%
and to start hearing it.

00:16:10.210 --> 00:16:14.940 align:middle line:84%
So this is going to be a
balancing act between us

00:16:14.940 --> 00:16:19.770 align:middle line:84%
accepting and really being open
to validating the thoughts that

00:16:19.770 --> 00:16:25.140 align:middle line:84%
come through our mind with
the openness of allowing

00:16:25.140 --> 00:16:28.570 align:middle line:84%
the surrender to take
place to the heart center.

00:16:28.570 --> 00:16:32.100 align:middle line:84%
Then opening ourselves
to the heart center

00:16:32.100 --> 00:16:37.920 align:middle line:84%
is what will allow us to
connect directly with source.

00:16:37.920 --> 00:16:40.980 align:middle line:84%
So now that we've discerned the
difference between the lower

00:16:40.980 --> 00:16:43.380 align:middle line:84%
mind and the higher
mind, I'm going

00:16:43.380 --> 00:16:45.240 align:middle line:84%

a meditation you

00:16:45.240 --> 00:16:47.180 align:middle line:90%

It will not feel like
an emotional peak.

00:17:10.319 --> 00:17:16.190 align:middle line:84%

without expectation of emotion.

Sometimes, it even feels
cold because the heart space

00:17:25.589 --> 00:17:26.573 align:middle line:90%
is so vast.

to release anticipation.

must look a certain way and

Once you have
released anticipation,

communication you do receive.

that you are indeed

something as common and as
