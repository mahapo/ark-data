Have you ever wondered if
some people in your life

00:00:21.520 --> 00:00:24.080 align:middle line:84%
are playing a role
in your evolution,

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:27.760 align:middle line:90%
but aren't fully aware of it?

00:00:27.760 --> 00:00:31.960 align:middle line:84%
Like those who seem to fill
the background of your reality,

00:00:31.960 --> 00:00:38.080 align:middle line:84%
enhancing your experience like
programmed players in a game.

00:00:38.080 --> 00:00:40.640 align:middle line:84%
Are all these individuals
fully conscious

00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:45.000 align:middle line:84%
beings, or are some of
them created to guide us

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.240 align:middle line:90%
on our spiritual growth?

00:00:48.240 --> 00:00:52.480 align:middle line:84%
The concept of Non-player
Characters or NPCs,

00:00:52.480 --> 00:00:56.560 align:middle line:84%
sometimes referred to as
backdrop or background people,

00:00:56.560 --> 00:01:01.260 align:middle line:84%
challenges us to rethink
who is truly conscious.

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:10.890 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:14.610 align:middle line:84%
If we think of what actually
is the criteria that makes up

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:19.570 align:middle line:84%
a soul, what we would see is
that it is an individuated unit

00:01:19.570 --> 00:01:25.250 align:middle line:84%
of consciousness and that it
has the attributes of sentience

00:01:25.250 --> 00:01:26.570 align:middle line:90%
behind it.

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:32.050 align:middle line:10%
So sentience and consciousness
is what animates a soul.

00:01:32.050 --> 00:01:34.850 align:middle line:84%
Now, this is exactly
the attributes

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:38.290 align:middle line:84%
that are lacking within
a nonplayer character.

00:01:38.290 --> 00:01:42.330 align:middle line:84%
So although we may look
the same on the surface,

00:01:42.330 --> 00:01:46.530 align:middle line:84%
backdrop people are lacking
that consciousness and that soul

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:49.330 align:middle line:90%
unit that animates us.

00:01:49.330 --> 00:01:51.620 align:middle line:84%
And that's also known
as the God spark.

00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:54.410 align:middle line:90%


00:01:54.410 --> 00:01:57.690 align:middle line:84%
The larger concept behind
background characters

00:01:57.690 --> 00:02:01.070 align:middle line:84%
was given to us by the work
of the quantum hypnotherapist

00:02:01.070 --> 00:02:02.870 align:middle line:90%
Dolores Cannon.

00:02:02.870 --> 00:02:05.670 align:middle line:10%
What Dolores Cannon
was discovering

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:08.150 align:middle line:10%
within her regression
therapy sessions

00:02:08.150 --> 00:02:12.750 align:middle line:10%
was that her clients were all
having the same information

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:16.830 align:middle line:10%
come up about these
energetic, holographic figures

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:19.870 align:middle line:10%
within our reality that
are meant to be here

00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:24.470 align:middle line:10%
for a specific purpose, and
that's for our own evolution

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:25.950 align:middle line:10%
and growth.

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:28.270 align:middle line:84%
So what this term
means when it comes

00:02:28.270 --> 00:02:30.690 align:middle line:84%
to the modern
storyline around it,

00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:34.510 align:middle line:84%
is that there's more than
just a filling of space

00:02:34.510 --> 00:02:37.870 align:middle line:84%
that these extras or backdrop
people are taking up.

00:02:37.870 --> 00:02:42.510 align:middle line:84%
They're actually serving a
very vital role for our lessons

00:02:42.510 --> 00:02:47.310 align:middle line:84%
and our curriculum
within this reality.

00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:50.750 align:middle line:84%
Some of the information that
Dolores Cannon was receiving

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:54.390 align:middle line:84%
from her clients who were
in a hypnotized state

00:02:54.390 --> 00:02:58.320 align:middle line:84%
was that these backdrop
people actually

00:02:58.320 --> 00:03:01.640 align:middle line:84%
are transported
across star systems

00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:07.000 align:middle line:84%
to be backdrop people around
many different galaxies

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:09.280 align:middle line:90%
and in many different worlds.

00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:13.760 align:middle line:84%
So it's not just a theme
of the Earth school,

00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:17.860 align:middle line:84%
but instead they're more
like a tool of this universe.

00:03:17.860 --> 00:03:20.280 align:middle line:84%
And because they're a
tool, they get transported

00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:23.800 align:middle line:84%
to different places where
they play that vital role

00:03:23.800 --> 00:03:25.600 align:middle line:90%
for a world's curriculum.

00:03:25.600 --> 00:03:28.560 align:middle line:90%


00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:30.400 align:middle line:84%
So when we think
about what comprises

00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:35.000 align:middle line:84%
our reality, at the core of
it, everything is energy.

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:41.040 align:middle line:84%
So what these NPCs would be
is just energetic projections

00:03:41.040 --> 00:03:44.760 align:middle line:84%
of a larger, more hive
mind consciousness, one

00:03:44.760 --> 00:03:48.480 align:middle line:84%
that is not individuated
enough and therefore lacks

00:03:48.480 --> 00:03:50.840 align:middle line:90%
the property of a soul.

00:03:50.840 --> 00:03:54.560 align:middle line:84%
We could also perceive this
concept of nonplayer characters

00:03:54.560 --> 00:03:59.140 align:middle line:84%
as unconditional love,
giving us a backdrop,

00:03:59.140 --> 00:04:03.020 align:middle line:84%
and giving us a scene
and a whole stage

00:04:03.020 --> 00:04:07.100 align:middle line:84%
for us to learn and play
out a curriculum within.

00:04:07.100 --> 00:04:09.820 align:middle line:84%
And so these backdrop
characters aren't

00:04:09.820 --> 00:04:14.020 align:middle line:84%
about necessarily
dehumanizing others around us,

00:04:14.020 --> 00:04:16.980 align:middle line:84%
but instead helping
us understand

00:04:16.980 --> 00:04:21.980 align:middle line:84%
why not everyone has the
same level of consciousness

00:04:21.980 --> 00:04:23.140 align:middle line:90%
and awareness.

00:04:23.140 --> 00:04:27.420 align:middle line:84%
And even the same level of
wanting to be more conscious

00:04:27.420 --> 00:04:31.300 align:middle line:84%
and wanting to have a larger
capacity of awareness.

00:04:31.300 --> 00:04:33.620 align:middle line:84%
So that's how
unconditional love plays

00:04:33.620 --> 00:04:35.660 align:middle line:90%
a vital role in all of this.

00:04:35.660 --> 00:04:37.940 align:middle line:84%
It's not to diminish
others, and it's not

00:04:37.940 --> 00:04:39.780 align:middle line:90%
to diminish our environment.

00:04:39.780 --> 00:04:43.260 align:middle line:84%
It's actually perceiving
our whole reality

00:04:43.260 --> 00:04:47.020 align:middle line:84%
and perceiving our
whole existence

00:04:47.020 --> 00:04:51.700 align:middle line:84%
through a new dimension,
one where we can actually

00:04:51.700 --> 00:04:55.110 align:middle line:84%
allow others to have
other belief systems

00:04:55.110 --> 00:04:58.790 align:middle line:84%
and live completely opposite
than how we would live and exist

00:04:58.790 --> 00:05:01.070 align:middle line:90%
however they wish to exist.

00:05:01.070 --> 00:05:06.230 align:middle line:84%
It's not so that we insert our
own projections onto others

00:05:06.230 --> 00:05:11.150 align:middle line:84%
as being less superior
and even inferior to us.

00:05:11.150 --> 00:05:12.830 align:middle line:90%
Instead, it's the opposite.

00:05:12.830 --> 00:05:14.910 align:middle line:84%
It's for us to be
able to learn how

00:05:14.910 --> 00:05:18.750 align:middle line:84%
to allow others to
have and to be whatever

00:05:18.750 --> 00:05:20.240 align:middle line:90%
they wish to be and have.

00:05:20.240 --> 00:05:25.070 align:middle line:90%


00:05:25.070 --> 00:05:29.630 align:middle line:84%
The true origins of this
concept of nonplayer characters

00:05:29.630 --> 00:05:33.230 align:middle line:84%
actually comes from
ancient esotericism.

00:05:33.230 --> 00:05:35.710 align:middle line:90%
It comes from Gnosticism.

00:05:35.710 --> 00:05:40.030 align:middle line:84%
In Gnostic scripture, there
are three different types

00:05:40.030 --> 00:05:43.030 align:middle line:90%
of souls within this matrix.

00:05:43.030 --> 00:05:46.150 align:middle line:84%
The first soul class
is the most advanced,

00:05:46.150 --> 00:05:49.990 align:middle line:84%
and they are the ones that are
the most spiritually imbued

00:05:49.990 --> 00:05:51.630 align:middle line:90%
with the God spark.

00:05:51.630 --> 00:05:54.440 align:middle line:84%
This is the class known
as the pneumatics.

00:05:54.440 --> 00:05:57.920 align:middle line:84%
The pneumatics are known
for having the God spark,

00:05:57.920 --> 00:06:01.960 align:middle line:84%
which is also giving
them the eyes to see

00:06:01.960 --> 00:06:04.400 align:middle line:90%
and the ears to hear.

00:06:04.400 --> 00:06:08.480 align:middle line:84%
This is an esoteric trope
for being able to understand

00:06:08.480 --> 00:06:11.720 align:middle line:90%
and perceive spiritual sight.

00:06:11.720 --> 00:06:15.720 align:middle line:84%
The second group of souls
is known as the psychics.

00:06:15.720 --> 00:06:21.120 align:middle line:84%
Psychics are soul individuals
and they are evolved as well.

00:06:21.120 --> 00:06:25.440 align:middle line:84%
They're just not as evolved
as the pneumatic class.

00:06:25.440 --> 00:06:29.960 align:middle line:84%
And then we have the third
soul group inside this matrix,

00:06:29.960 --> 00:06:31.960 align:middle line:90%
and that is the hylics.

00:06:31.960 --> 00:06:34.480 align:middle line:84%
This is where we get
the term nonplayer

00:06:34.480 --> 00:06:37.400 align:middle line:84%
characters from the
hylics are beings

00:06:37.400 --> 00:06:40.240 align:middle line:90%
that have no individuated soul.

00:06:40.240 --> 00:06:44.360 align:middle line:84%
They are strictly made
up of the material realm.

00:06:44.360 --> 00:06:47.600 align:middle line:84%
They are known as being
base consciousness

00:06:47.600 --> 00:06:53.420 align:middle line:84%
and made of matter only, with
no ability for the God spark.

00:06:53.420 --> 00:06:58.700 align:middle line:84%
So they are strictly oriented
in the Earth curriculum that has

00:06:58.700 --> 00:07:01.100 align:middle line:90%
to do with material existence.

00:07:01.100 --> 00:07:05.820 align:middle line:84%
And that's why they're so
repelled by a larger awareness

00:07:05.820 --> 00:07:09.100 align:middle line:84%
and repelled by
consciousness itself.

00:07:09.100 --> 00:07:12.380 align:middle line:84%
It's because that's not a
part of their curriculum.

00:07:12.380 --> 00:07:15.220 align:middle line:84%
They're in base
consciousness, the lowest

00:07:15.220 --> 00:07:17.220 align:middle line:90%
level of consciousness.

00:07:17.220 --> 00:07:21.100 align:middle line:84%
That's like asking a child
to then be in college.

00:07:21.100 --> 00:07:25.020 align:middle line:84%
It's simply not a part
of their curriculum.

00:07:25.020 --> 00:07:29.420 align:middle line:84%
So in Gnosticism, hylics aren't
here just as backdrop people

00:07:29.420 --> 00:07:32.580 align:middle line:84%
to serve our own growth
and to help us become more

00:07:32.580 --> 00:07:34.660 align:middle line:90%
unconditionally loving.

00:07:34.660 --> 00:07:38.860 align:middle line:84%
Instead, they're a
class of soul group here

00:07:38.860 --> 00:07:45.780 align:middle line:84%
that has the least capacity and
the least attributes of soul.

00:07:45.780 --> 00:07:49.990 align:middle line:84%
Whereas in the backdrop
character phenomenon,

00:07:49.990 --> 00:07:53.790 align:middle line:84%
these are now taken into
a slightly new context

00:07:53.790 --> 00:07:57.510 align:middle line:84%
where they do serve a
purpose for our own growth.

00:07:57.510 --> 00:08:03.110 align:middle line:84%
And they do have a vital role
from the universe at large.

00:08:03.110 --> 00:08:05.790 align:middle line:84%
But because all levels
of consciousness

00:08:05.790 --> 00:08:10.910 align:middle line:84%
are here together, mixed in with
one another in the Earth school,

00:08:10.910 --> 00:08:14.990 align:middle line:84%
we are all served by
each other's curriculum

00:08:14.990 --> 00:08:17.870 align:middle line:84%
and by each other's
level of consciousness.

00:08:17.870 --> 00:08:19.990 align:middle line:90%
This isn't about superiority.

00:08:19.990 --> 00:08:22.610 align:middle line:84%
All of us have things
we need to work on.

00:08:22.610 --> 00:08:26.270 align:middle line:84%
We're just at different
levels of consciousness.

00:08:26.270 --> 00:08:32.470 align:middle line:84%
So when we look at NPCs, or even
from Gnostic knowledge hylics,

00:08:32.470 --> 00:08:36.429 align:middle line:84%
whichever way we want to
look at this concept through,

00:08:36.429 --> 00:08:40.309 align:middle line:84%
it's really a story arc,
much like Pinocchio,

00:08:40.309 --> 00:08:44.500 align:middle line:84%
where we're all just on a
journey of becoming a real boy.

00:08:44.500 --> 00:08:48.240 align:middle line:90%


00:08:48.240 --> 00:08:52.160 align:middle line:84%
The concept of nonplayer
characters or NPCs

00:08:52.160 --> 00:08:54.920 align:middle line:84%
did not originate within
the spirit of this age.

00:08:54.920 --> 00:08:58.560 align:middle line:84%
But the modern
storyline to them is

00:08:58.560 --> 00:09:03.680 align:middle line:84%
that they operate a lot like the
video game players that we see,

00:09:03.680 --> 00:09:08.160 align:middle line:90%
except the backdrop characters.

00:09:08.160 --> 00:09:10.720 align:middle line:84%
So just like how
in a video game,

00:09:10.720 --> 00:09:14.200 align:middle line:84%
the person who is playing
a game has a controller,

00:09:14.200 --> 00:09:18.560 align:middle line:84%
we can use that as an
analogy for a higher self.

00:09:18.560 --> 00:09:21.960 align:middle line:84%
And so NPCs wouldn't have
somebody playing them

00:09:21.960 --> 00:09:26.600 align:middle line:84%
behind the controller, they
wouldn't have a higher self.

00:09:26.600 --> 00:09:30.320 align:middle line:84%
They'd be strictly
projections of the video game

00:09:30.320 --> 00:09:33.960 align:middle line:84%
to help make that person
who does have a controller,

00:09:33.960 --> 00:09:38.520 align:middle line:84%
feel the ambience of that
game to be more real.

00:09:38.520 --> 00:09:42.080 align:middle line:84%
That's exactly
how this term NPCs

00:09:42.080 --> 00:09:47.580 align:middle line:84%
is applied to people in our
reality who we see around us

00:09:47.580 --> 00:09:50.580 align:middle line:84%
and who are a part
of our environment.

00:09:50.580 --> 00:09:55.260 align:middle line:84%
That may not actually have
as much soul and sentience

00:09:55.260 --> 00:09:58.500 align:middle line:84%
and consciousness
behind them as we do.

00:09:58.500 --> 00:10:01.280 align:middle line:84%
It's because they are
strictly energy here

00:10:01.280 --> 00:10:04.220 align:middle line:84%
to fill up our environment
so that it appears

00:10:04.220 --> 00:10:08.180 align:middle line:90%
substantial and legitimate.

00:10:08.180 --> 00:10:09.980 align:middle line:84%
Now, naturally,
many of us might be

00:10:09.980 --> 00:10:13.940 align:middle line:84%
thinking at this moment what
makes a person a nonplayer

00:10:13.940 --> 00:10:16.140 align:middle line:90%
character?

00:10:16.140 --> 00:10:18.960 align:middle line:90%
Are we nonplayer characters?

00:10:18.960 --> 00:10:21.980 align:middle line:84%
What is that sign or
symptom that you'll

00:10:21.980 --> 00:10:24.180 align:middle line:90%
be able to identify them by?

00:10:24.180 --> 00:10:28.060 align:middle line:84%
It's usually something that's
far more subtle, but still very

00:10:28.060 --> 00:10:33.220 align:middle line:84%
firm within a being, and
that is an absolute repulsion

00:10:33.220 --> 00:10:35.980 align:middle line:90%
to becoming aware at all.

00:10:35.980 --> 00:10:39.060 align:middle line:84%
An absolute
allegiance to anything

00:10:39.060 --> 00:10:42.300 align:middle line:84%
that is of the status
quo and anything

00:10:42.300 --> 00:10:46.910 align:middle line:84%
that belongs to the matrix
control and belief systems.

00:10:46.910 --> 00:10:49.710 align:middle line:84%
Another way of looking
at this whole phenomenon

00:10:49.710 --> 00:10:53.310 align:middle line:84%
is actually addressing it
through the perception of just

00:10:53.310 --> 00:10:55.590 align:middle line:90%
levels of consciousness.

00:10:55.590 --> 00:10:59.710 align:middle line:84%
That would make anyone at a
lower level of consciousness

00:10:59.710 --> 00:11:03.670 align:middle line:84%
and a specific bandwidth
be under that category

00:11:03.670 --> 00:11:06.670 align:middle line:90%
of a nonplayer character.

00:11:06.670 --> 00:11:12.870 align:middle line:84%
So instead of an ill fate, it's
more like a lower frequency

00:11:12.870 --> 00:11:16.950 align:middle line:84%
that we operate in, one that
is complete unawareness, one

00:11:16.950 --> 00:11:21.190 align:middle line:84%
that even has a little bit of
a disdain for consciousness

00:11:21.190 --> 00:11:22.470 align:middle line:90%
itself.

00:11:22.470 --> 00:11:25.270 align:middle line:84%
And when we think of
it as being the lowest

00:11:25.270 --> 00:11:27.670 align:middle line:84%
bandwidth of
consciousness, now we

00:11:27.670 --> 00:11:31.430 align:middle line:84%
can see that we can fall into
this category of nonplayer

00:11:31.430 --> 00:11:34.270 align:middle line:84%
characters, and we
can just as much

00:11:34.270 --> 00:11:38.590 align:middle line:84%
grow out of this level
of nonplayer character.

00:11:38.590 --> 00:11:41.230 align:middle line:84%
So if you're lowering your
level of consciousness

00:11:41.230 --> 00:11:44.770 align:middle line:84%
and it drops enough
into this bandwidth,

00:11:44.770 --> 00:11:48.598 align:middle line:84%
that means your higher self
dropped the video controller

00:11:48.598 --> 00:11:49.640 align:middle line:90%
and went to the bathroom.

00:11:49.640 --> 00:11:52.610 align:middle line:90%


00:11:52.610 --> 00:11:56.610 align:middle line:84%
So in the modern layout
of nonplayer characters,

00:11:56.610 --> 00:11:59.810 align:middle line:84%
they're more acting like
agents in the matrix.

00:11:59.810 --> 00:12:02.170 align:middle line:84%
Just as with petty
tyrants, they're

00:12:02.170 --> 00:12:05.810 align:middle line:84%
able to be plugged
into at any moment.

00:12:05.810 --> 00:12:08.210 align:middle line:84%
They're operating
from a hive mind.

00:12:08.210 --> 00:12:11.090 align:middle line:84%
And since they have
no individuated units

00:12:11.090 --> 00:12:14.410 align:middle line:84%
of consciousness, they're
more like portals.

00:12:14.410 --> 00:12:17.730 align:middle line:84%
In fact, some esoteric
knowledge knows them

00:12:17.730 --> 00:12:22.610 align:middle line:84%
by the name organic
portals for this reason.

00:12:22.610 --> 00:12:26.650 align:middle line:84%
It's because they're
human to a certain extent,

00:12:26.650 --> 00:12:28.330 align:middle line:90%
but not fully human.

00:12:28.330 --> 00:12:30.450 align:middle line:90%
So they can be used as a portal.

00:12:30.450 --> 00:12:34.370 align:middle line:84%
And when they're in this state
of being used as a portal,

00:12:34.370 --> 00:12:39.770 align:middle line:84%
they're able to come at us in
some vital way for our growth

00:12:39.770 --> 00:12:45.660 align:middle line:84%
so they're used by the
matrix at large in any way

00:12:45.660 --> 00:12:49.620 align:middle line:84%
that the control system
needs to use them.

00:12:49.620 --> 00:12:51.460 align:middle line:84%
So when it's using
them, it won't all

00:12:51.460 --> 00:12:53.340 align:middle line:90%
look the same exact way.

00:12:53.340 --> 00:12:57.100 align:middle line:84%
But since they can be
tapped into at any time,

00:12:57.100 --> 00:13:00.000 align:middle line:84%
usually it's for a
very obvious reason,

00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:05.140 align:middle line:84%
such as coming at us in a way to
hinder or block our own growth.

00:13:05.140 --> 00:13:09.260 align:middle line:84%
So it's in some way of
casting and transmitting

00:13:09.260 --> 00:13:13.300 align:middle line:84%
energy towards us, to
shut us down and stop us

00:13:13.300 --> 00:13:15.560 align:middle line:84%
in some way from
our own evolution.

00:13:15.560 --> 00:13:18.700 align:middle line:90%


00:13:18.700 --> 00:13:21.500 align:middle line:84%
Dolores Cannon's work
isn't the only one

00:13:21.500 --> 00:13:24.100 align:middle line:84%
that has an answer
and a perception

00:13:24.100 --> 00:13:26.660 align:middle line:90%
of this whole phenomenon.

00:13:26.660 --> 00:13:28.700 align:middle line:84%
There are still other
schools of thought

00:13:28.700 --> 00:13:31.660 align:middle line:90%
that explain what NPCs are.

00:13:31.660 --> 00:13:33.500 align:middle line:84%
Some of them come
from the perception

00:13:33.500 --> 00:13:36.060 align:middle line:84%
that nonplayer
characters are created

00:13:36.060 --> 00:13:40.260 align:middle line:84%
when a being has had so much
trauma inflicted upon them,

00:13:40.260 --> 00:13:44.910 align:middle line:84%
that the larger universe, as
a vital act of compassion,

00:13:44.910 --> 00:13:48.390 align:middle line:84%
withdraws that soul from
the trauma and pain,

00:13:48.390 --> 00:13:51.070 align:middle line:84%
leaving behind their
energetic vessel

00:13:51.070 --> 00:13:55.630 align:middle line:84%
so that their soul can still
heal and still grow and mature,

00:13:55.630 --> 00:13:58.710 align:middle line:84%
but without having to
endure all that pain.

00:13:58.710 --> 00:14:02.590 align:middle line:84%
Because from the
universal perception

00:14:02.590 --> 00:14:05.630 align:middle line:84%
and from universal
consciousness,

00:14:05.630 --> 00:14:09.430 align:middle line:84%
that being who's inflicting
pain upon a person

00:14:09.430 --> 00:14:14.390 align:middle line:84%
still has their own lessons and
their own karma to play out.

00:14:14.390 --> 00:14:16.990 align:middle line:84%
So instead of stopping
a person from learning

00:14:16.990 --> 00:14:20.150 align:middle line:84%
the lessons of inflicting
pain on another,

00:14:20.150 --> 00:14:23.230 align:middle line:84%
the matrix withdraws
the soul from the person

00:14:23.230 --> 00:14:26.350 align:middle line:84%
who's receiving that
pain and trauma,

00:14:26.350 --> 00:14:31.470 align:middle line:84%
turning them
temporarily into an NPC.

00:14:31.470 --> 00:14:34.950 align:middle line:84%
This allows the
energy of a being

00:14:34.950 --> 00:14:38.830 align:middle line:84%
to still be there, but
without the actual pain

00:14:38.830 --> 00:14:42.410 align:middle line:84%
that they have to
continue to endure.

00:14:42.410 --> 00:14:45.970 align:middle line:84%
Now, I am actually not saying
that any of that is true,

00:14:45.970 --> 00:14:47.970 align:middle line:84%
but that is another
perception that

00:14:47.970 --> 00:14:51.000 align:middle line:84%
has explained this
phenomenon within this age.

00:14:51.000 --> 00:14:54.410 align:middle line:90%


00:14:54.410 --> 00:14:57.730 align:middle line:84%
So the idea of there
being nonplayer characters

00:14:57.730 --> 00:15:01.930 align:middle line:84%
can sometimes give us
main character energy.

00:15:01.930 --> 00:15:04.450 align:middle line:84%
When we have main
character energy,

00:15:04.450 --> 00:15:09.450 align:middle line:84%
we can diminish everything
around us through this concept.

00:15:09.450 --> 00:15:13.170 align:middle line:84%
And that's one of the pitfalls
to this idea of there being

00:15:13.170 --> 00:15:16.330 align:middle line:84%
nonplayer characters, is
that it can accidentally

00:15:16.330 --> 00:15:19.530 align:middle line:84%
create a narcissistic
bubble around ourselves.

00:15:19.530 --> 00:15:23.490 align:middle line:84%
And when we do this, we start
disconnecting from reality

00:15:23.490 --> 00:15:27.050 align:middle line:84%
and living in
individual realities.

00:15:27.050 --> 00:15:30.890 align:middle line:84%
And that is what the
definition of solipsism is.

00:15:30.890 --> 00:15:34.210 align:middle line:90%
Solipsism is a rite of passage.

00:15:34.210 --> 00:15:35.930 align:middle line:90%
We can't really avoid it.

00:15:35.930 --> 00:15:39.620 align:middle line:84%
We're going to run into
it because solipsism

00:15:39.620 --> 00:15:43.540 align:middle line:84%
enters our reality when we're
going through a growth spurt.

00:15:43.540 --> 00:15:47.900 align:middle line:84%
So when we're expanding, we're
in such a state of confusion

00:15:47.900 --> 00:15:52.220 align:middle line:84%
that many times it's easy
for us to believe that we

00:15:52.220 --> 00:15:55.700 align:middle line:90%
are the only thing that's real.

00:15:55.700 --> 00:15:59.740 align:middle line:84%
But if we know in advance that
this is actually a growth spurt,

00:15:59.740 --> 00:16:02.580 align:middle line:84%
we can navigate this
growth and expansion

00:16:02.580 --> 00:16:05.420 align:middle line:84%
we're experiencing
through confusion

00:16:05.420 --> 00:16:09.340 align:middle line:84%
without falling into the
pitfalls of narcissism.

00:16:09.340 --> 00:16:14.820 align:middle line:84%
And in truth, all of us start
off at a very low capacity.

00:16:14.820 --> 00:16:18.460 align:middle line:84%
And this is what the whole
work of developing free will

00:16:18.460 --> 00:16:19.660 align:middle line:90%
is about.

00:16:19.660 --> 00:16:22.740 align:middle line:84%
Because we start off
with just a kernel of it,

00:16:22.740 --> 00:16:27.980 align:middle line:84%
and we have many different
layers of fate and even karma

00:16:27.980 --> 00:16:32.380 align:middle line:84%
overlaid over our free
will and our soul.

00:16:32.380 --> 00:16:37.200 align:middle line:84%
And from there, it is our
task to become more aware

00:16:37.200 --> 00:16:40.120 align:middle line:84%
and to grow and
develop our free will

00:16:40.120 --> 00:16:43.520 align:middle line:84%
and to individuate
our consciousness.

00:16:43.520 --> 00:16:47.040 align:middle line:84%
So the individuation
story arc isn't only

00:16:47.040 --> 00:16:49.560 align:middle line:84%
for the backdrop
people, it's also

00:16:49.560 --> 00:16:53.200 align:middle line:84%
for every single person who's
on a spiritual awakening

00:16:53.200 --> 00:16:56.840 align:middle line:90%
journey just like Pinocchio.

00:16:56.840 --> 00:16:59.200 align:middle line:90%
NPCs are not obstacles.

00:16:59.200 --> 00:17:02.960 align:middle line:84%
They are mirrors reflecting
our deepest lessons,

00:17:02.960 --> 00:17:05.839 align:middle line:84%
helping us confront
blind spots and evolve

00:17:05.839 --> 00:17:07.960 align:middle line:90%
our spiritual journey.

00:17:07.960 --> 00:17:12.400 align:middle line:84%
By recognizing them as
part of the cosmic design,

00:17:12.400 --> 00:17:16.440 align:middle line:84%
we transcend judgment and
see the interconnectedness

00:17:16.440 --> 00:17:18.280 align:middle line:90%
in all things.

00:17:18.280 --> 00:17:23.400 align:middle line:84%
The true revelation, even in
their seeming absence of soul,

00:17:23.400 --> 00:17:27.139 align:middle line:84%
they are guiding us toward our
highest, most awakened selves.
