00:00:09.110 --> 00:00:13.080 align:middle line:84%
>> I'm Sarah Elkhaldy, and
this is Mystery Teachings.

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:16.820 align:middle line:90%


00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:21.110 align:middle line:84%
Have you experienced a moment
where reality seemed to glitch?

00:00:21.110 --> 00:00:26.360 align:middle line:84%
Like something didn't quite
match up with your memory.

00:00:26.360 --> 00:00:30.410 align:middle line:84%
What if the shifts we feel
aren't just coincidences,

00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:35.570 align:middle line:84%
but the subtle unraveling
of reality itself?

00:00:35.570 --> 00:00:41.150 align:middle line:84%
This mysterious phenomenon has
been called the Mandela effect.

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:44.786 align:middle line:84%
Could this be proof that
we're living in a multiverse?

00:00:44.786 --> 00:00:48.620 align:middle line:90%


00:00:48.620 --> 00:00:50.780 align:middle line:10%
The name Mandela
effect was coined

00:00:50.780 --> 00:00:55.310 align:middle line:10%
by people who had noticed two
distinct, different timelines

00:00:55.310 --> 00:01:00.260 align:middle line:10%
that the population at large had
a collective memory around it.

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:03.100 align:middle line:10%
One group of the
population vividly

00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:07.510 align:middle line:10%
remembers that Nelson
Mandela had died in prison.

00:01:07.510 --> 00:01:11.930 align:middle line:84%
The other group remembers
that he not only left prison,

00:01:11.930 --> 00:01:15.670 align:middle line:84%
he went on to be the
president of South Africa.

00:01:15.670 --> 00:01:18.610 align:middle line:84%
This phenomenon
is any time there

00:01:18.610 --> 00:01:22.460 align:middle line:84%
is more than one collective
memory around an event,

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:27.430 align:middle line:84%
or an aspect of reality, where
large populations of people

00:01:27.430 --> 00:01:31.160 align:middle line:84%
remember a specific
version of reality.

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:34.030 align:middle line:84%
But we are not currently
on the timeline

00:01:34.030 --> 00:01:37.300 align:middle line:84%
where that version
of reality exists.

00:01:37.300 --> 00:01:39.610 align:middle line:84%
The Mandela effect
is a phenomenon

00:01:39.610 --> 00:01:43.670 align:middle line:84%
of parallel realities,
time, and choice.

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:48.010 align:middle line:84%
It is not caused by one,
single, standalone reason.

00:01:48.010 --> 00:01:51.880 align:middle line:84%
Rather, it is produced by
multiple different origins

00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:55.240 align:middle line:84%
that all can lead to the
glitches that we see.

00:01:55.240 --> 00:01:57.820 align:middle line:84%
Even if we experience
the Mandela effect

00:01:57.820 --> 00:02:02.580 align:middle line:84%
through the faculty of memory,
its implications are far deeper

00:02:02.580 --> 00:02:07.080 align:middle line:84%
and reveal there are esoteric
laws to this reality that we

00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:08.404 align:middle line:90%
must become aware of.

00:02:08.404 --> 00:02:10.919 align:middle line:90%


00:02:10.919 --> 00:02:15.360 align:middle line:84%
There are three dominant aspects
that this phenomenon operates

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:16.410 align:middle line:90%
as.

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:21.360 align:middle line:84%
But keep in mind, there are less
definable and far more subtle

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:23.970 align:middle line:90%
causes to this as well.

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:26.400 align:middle line:84%
The first is when our
collective timeline

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:30.660 align:middle line:84%
has shifted to a parallel
version of reality.

00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:34.810 align:middle line:84%
A timeline that is just as
real as the timeline we are on,

00:02:34.810 --> 00:02:37.620 align:middle line:84%
but that it had an
alternate experience

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:40.470 align:middle line:90%
with alternate outcomes.

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:43.890 align:middle line:84%
Just like how many people had
alternate memories of Nelson

00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:47.940 align:middle line:84%
Mandela, and that only some of
the people within the collective

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:52.380 align:middle line:84%
remember the past timeline
because they did not fully

00:02:52.380 --> 00:02:57.210 align:middle line:90%
integrate into the new timeline.

00:02:57.210 --> 00:03:00.030 align:middle line:84%
The second major reason
of this phenomenon

00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:03.210 align:middle line:90%
is due to retrocausality.

00:03:03.210 --> 00:03:06.480 align:middle line:84%
Retrocausality proposes
that future events

00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:09.100 align:middle line:84%
can have an impact
on past events,

00:03:09.100 --> 00:03:11.730 align:middle line:84%
challenging the traditional
understanding of cause

00:03:11.730 --> 00:03:14.880 align:middle line:84%
and effect as a
forward-moving process.

00:03:14.880 --> 00:03:18.240 align:middle line:84%
And an analogy of
retrocausality could

00:03:18.240 --> 00:03:20.370 align:middle line:90%
be like the butterfly effect.

00:03:20.370 --> 00:03:23.760 align:middle line:84%
The butterfly effect suggests
that small, seemingly

00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:26.280 align:middle line:84%
insignificant
actions or events can

00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:29.640 align:middle line:84%
lead to large and
unpredictable consequences.

00:03:29.640 --> 00:03:32.290 align:middle line:84%
Such as a butterfly
flapping its wings,

00:03:32.290 --> 00:03:34.650 align:middle line:84%
and then that tiny
movement causes

00:03:34.650 --> 00:03:36.870 align:middle line:84%
a chain of events
that eventually

00:03:36.870 --> 00:03:40.170 align:middle line:90%
leads to a massive tsunami.

00:03:40.170 --> 00:03:44.310 align:middle line:84%
The third dominant way that the
Mandela effect can be produced

00:03:44.310 --> 00:03:47.820 align:middle line:90%
is by a collective choice point.

00:03:47.820 --> 00:03:51.000 align:middle line:84%
A choice point is a
significant and crucial point

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:53.970 align:middle line:84%
when the direction of
the future is made.

00:03:53.970 --> 00:03:56.130 align:middle line:84%
The majority of people
are not consciously

00:03:56.130 --> 00:03:58.240 align:middle line:90%
aware of a choice point.

00:03:58.240 --> 00:04:02.370 align:middle line:84%
It is usually a choice made
at the subconscious level.

00:04:02.370 --> 00:04:04.980 align:middle line:84%
When a collective
reaches a choice point,

00:04:04.980 --> 00:04:09.140 align:middle line:84%
you may see many Mandela
effects because you're

00:04:09.140 --> 00:04:12.840 align:middle line:84%
really seeing a crucial
choice point unfolding.

00:04:12.840 --> 00:04:16.430 align:middle line:84%
And it may look like
subtle or huge glitches

00:04:16.430 --> 00:04:19.970 align:middle line:84%
because those glitches are
moving toward and responding

00:04:19.970 --> 00:04:22.710 align:middle line:90%
to a teleological vein.

00:04:22.710 --> 00:04:26.310 align:middle line:84%
So they have a larger
purpose and design,

00:04:26.310 --> 00:04:30.900 align:middle line:84%
much like a magnet is moving
powerfully to its attractor,

00:04:30.900 --> 00:04:36.560 align:middle line:84%
even if we can't perceive
where or what is attracting it.

00:04:36.560 --> 00:04:40.650 align:middle line:84%
Some common examples of how this
Mandela effect is taking place,

00:04:40.650 --> 00:04:43.620 align:middle line:84%
even at mundane levels
right in front of our eyes,

00:04:43.620 --> 00:04:48.110 align:middle line:84%
is through the cornucopia logo
that Fruit of the Loom had

00:04:48.110 --> 00:04:50.960 align:middle line:84%
in the '90s, but now totally
says they didn't have,

00:04:50.960 --> 00:04:54.530 align:middle line:84%
or the spelling change of the
word fruit in the Froot Loops

00:04:54.530 --> 00:05:00.110 align:middle line:90%
logo, Starbucks, Sketchers.

00:05:00.110 --> 00:05:03.230 align:middle line:10%
Not only will we remember
brand logos differently,

00:05:03.230 --> 00:05:07.280 align:middle line:10%
like those of KitKat, Oscar
Mayer, or Looney Tunes,

00:05:07.280 --> 00:05:10.390 align:middle line:10%
but we will also notice some
of our beloved childhood

00:05:10.390 --> 00:05:14.420 align:middle line:10%
characters, like Curious
George or even Pikachu,

00:05:14.420 --> 00:05:18.250 align:middle line:10%
changing before our very eyes.

00:05:18.250 --> 00:05:22.820 align:middle line:84%
Or how Darth Vader clearly
said, "Luke, I am your father,"

00:05:22.820 --> 00:05:27.850 align:middle line:84%
and now somehow that got turned
into, "No, I am your father."

00:05:27.850 --> 00:05:29.540 align:middle line:90%
I could go on.

00:05:29.540 --> 00:05:33.070 align:middle line:84%
All of these are so
many different ways

00:05:33.070 --> 00:05:36.950 align:middle line:84%
that the Mandela effect is
perceived through our reality,

00:05:36.950 --> 00:05:39.610 align:middle line:84%
but they may not
all be responding

00:05:39.610 --> 00:05:46.810 align:middle line:84%
to one particular effect
or one contributing factor.

00:05:46.810 --> 00:05:49.760 align:middle line:84%
This is how odd
this phenomenon is.

00:05:49.760 --> 00:05:52.810 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't even need to be
a very large and compelling,

00:05:52.810 --> 00:05:54.590 align:middle line:90%
or even important event.

00:05:54.590 --> 00:05:58.900 align:middle line:84%
It could be something that just
really confuses us, and even can

00:05:58.900 --> 00:05:59.840 align:middle line:90%
perturb us.

00:05:59.840 --> 00:06:02.590 align:middle line:84%
So when we're looking
at the Mandela effect

00:06:02.590 --> 00:06:05.320 align:middle line:84%
through all of these
different lenses of it being

00:06:05.320 --> 00:06:09.060 align:middle line:84%
both subtle and gross,
what we're really doing

00:06:09.060 --> 00:06:11.190 align:middle line:84%
is seeing that
reality itself can

00:06:11.190 --> 00:06:16.920 align:middle line:84%
morph into any which way that
just suits whatever that higher

00:06:16.920 --> 00:06:19.530 align:middle line:84%
purpose or that
higher design that

00:06:19.530 --> 00:06:24.040 align:middle line:84%
was represented by that choice
point is really depicting.

00:06:24.040 --> 00:06:25.810 align:middle line:90%
And that's what's happening.

00:06:25.810 --> 00:06:29.730 align:middle line:84%
It's not for the sake of showing
us very small alternate versions

00:06:29.730 --> 00:06:30.820 align:middle line:90%
of reality.

00:06:30.820 --> 00:06:35.730 align:middle line:84%
Instead, it's twisting reality
in whatever minor or major ways

00:06:35.730 --> 00:06:40.170 align:middle line:84%
that it needs to in order to
reach that invisible design

00:06:40.170 --> 00:06:43.950 align:middle line:90%
and that invisible goal.

00:06:43.950 --> 00:06:46.770 align:middle line:90%
So how does a timeline win?

00:06:46.770 --> 00:06:49.350 align:middle line:84%
How does a collective
memory override

00:06:49.350 --> 00:06:51.510 align:middle line:90%
another collective memory?

00:06:51.510 --> 00:06:55.540 align:middle line:84%
The Mandela effect is responding
to our collective frequency.

00:06:55.540 --> 00:06:58.380 align:middle line:84%
That is what determines
which collective memory

00:06:58.380 --> 00:07:01.260 align:middle line:90%
we are living in.

00:07:01.260 --> 00:07:05.460 align:middle line:84%
The physical is a representation
of the metaphysical.

00:07:05.460 --> 00:07:09.270 align:middle line:84%
What this means is you can
look at how a wave collapses

00:07:09.270 --> 00:07:12.060 align:middle line:84%
into the ocean to
better understand

00:07:12.060 --> 00:07:17.010 align:middle line:84%
an even larger process
taking place beyond the ocean

00:07:17.010 --> 00:07:20.820 align:middle line:84%
and inside the sea of
consciousness itself.

00:07:20.820 --> 00:07:23.370 align:middle line:84%
The wave also
represents the process

00:07:23.370 --> 00:07:27.760 align:middle line:84%
of how reality is transported
from a potential state,

00:07:27.760 --> 00:07:32.520 align:middle line:84%
or superposition state,
into a formative state

00:07:32.520 --> 00:07:38.550 align:middle line:84%
before it is fully realized
and traverses back into itself.

00:07:38.550 --> 00:07:42.870 align:middle line:84%
How this connects to the Mandela
effect is through frequency.

00:07:42.870 --> 00:07:46.750 align:middle line:84%
How aware we become
alters our actions,

00:07:46.750 --> 00:07:50.610 align:middle line:84%
and our actions
impact our awareness

00:07:50.610 --> 00:07:55.980 align:middle line:84%
in a feedback loop that
rhythmically resembles a wave.

00:07:55.980 --> 00:08:00.990 align:middle line:84%
All of this alters our
frequency and the frequency

00:08:00.990 --> 00:08:06.030 align:middle line:84%
of the timeline we are
visually perceiving.

00:08:06.030 --> 00:08:10.670 align:middle line:84%
So the Mandela effect also is
heavily impacted by timelines

00:08:10.670 --> 00:08:14.670 align:middle line:84%
that we are syncing up with
through our personal frequency,

00:08:14.670 --> 00:08:18.290 align:middle line:84%
and then at our
collective frequency.

00:08:18.290 --> 00:08:22.520 align:middle line:84%
So what this means is that a
person standing right next to us

00:08:22.520 --> 00:08:26.780 align:middle line:84%
doesn't even need to be
on the same exact timeline

00:08:26.780 --> 00:08:28.970 align:middle line:90%
that we are on.

00:08:28.970 --> 00:08:31.280 align:middle line:84%
So a person standing
right next to us

00:08:31.280 --> 00:08:33.750 align:middle line:84%
can be on a completely
different timeline,

00:08:33.750 --> 00:08:39.350 align:middle line:84%
but we share a core resonance
within that spectrum

00:08:39.350 --> 00:08:40.679 align:middle line:90%
of a bandwidth.

00:08:40.679 --> 00:08:44.540 align:middle line:84%
Because how frequency
works is that it operates

00:08:44.540 --> 00:08:47.810 align:middle line:90%
within a bandwidth of a domain.

00:08:47.810 --> 00:08:52.280 align:middle line:84%
And this domain is what
we call a dimension.

00:08:52.280 --> 00:08:56.990 align:middle line:84%
So then the question becomes,
what creates frequency?

00:08:56.990 --> 00:09:02.960 align:middle line:84%
Frequency is the
combination of our thoughts,

00:09:02.960 --> 00:09:07.130 align:middle line:90%
our emotions, our actions.

00:09:07.130 --> 00:09:10.480 align:middle line:84%
And then all of
those three, they're

00:09:10.480 --> 00:09:14.620 align:middle line:90%
combined into our awareness.

00:09:14.620 --> 00:09:17.830 align:middle line:84%
So awareness is the
larger driving force

00:09:17.830 --> 00:09:20.090 align:middle line:90%
behind a frequency.

00:09:20.090 --> 00:09:23.110 align:middle line:84%
Well, the other
driving points that

00:09:23.110 --> 00:09:26.770 align:middle line:84%
are still valid and are
still feeding into and still

00:09:26.770 --> 00:09:29.770 align:middle line:84%
contributing their
input into frequency

00:09:29.770 --> 00:09:34.120 align:middle line:84%
are those thoughts,
feelings, and actions.

00:09:34.120 --> 00:09:37.870 align:middle line:84%
The awareness is what
governs our frequency.

00:09:37.870 --> 00:09:42.070 align:middle line:84%
And when we have a larger
awareness, now what we're doing

00:09:42.070 --> 00:09:46.870 align:middle line:84%
is having more liberating
and more positive thoughts.

00:09:46.870 --> 00:09:51.580 align:middle line:84%
We're having an
ability to integrate

00:09:51.580 --> 00:09:54.490 align:middle line:84%
and an ability to
really be with all

00:09:54.490 --> 00:09:57.940 align:middle line:84%
of our emotional state, which
allows it to naturally always

00:09:57.940 --> 00:10:02.470 align:middle line:84%
gravitate into
higher vibrations.

00:10:02.470 --> 00:10:04.910 align:middle line:90%
And then, our actions.

00:10:04.910 --> 00:10:08.800 align:middle line:84%
Now this is so important,
because we are only

00:10:08.800 --> 00:10:11.370 align:middle line:90%
as real as our actions.

00:10:11.370 --> 00:10:16.060 align:middle line:84%
We are theoretical until we
are in practice, not theory.

00:10:16.060 --> 00:10:19.510 align:middle line:84%
So our actions play a strong
driving force as well,

00:10:19.510 --> 00:10:21.930 align:middle line:84%
because our actions
are what create

00:10:21.930 --> 00:10:25.380 align:middle line:84%
the different circumstances
and the different causes

00:10:25.380 --> 00:10:30.040 align:middle line:84%
and effects that then
reinforce our frequency.

00:10:30.040 --> 00:10:33.510 align:middle line:84%
So frequency has many
different channels

00:10:33.510 --> 00:10:35.260 align:middle line:90%
that it's being input into.

00:10:35.260 --> 00:10:40.240 align:middle line:84%
And the more that we raise our
frequency through our awareness,

00:10:40.240 --> 00:10:42.730 align:middle line:84%
through our thoughts,
emotions, and actions,

00:10:42.730 --> 00:10:47.916 align:middle line:84%
now we start experiencing
entirely different timelines.

00:10:47.916 --> 00:10:52.350 align:middle line:90%


00:10:52.350 --> 00:10:54.780 align:middle line:84%
So the Mandela
effect can also be

00:10:54.780 --> 00:10:59.040 align:middle line:84%
looked at as a trail of
artifacts that are all pointing

00:10:59.040 --> 00:11:00.850 align:middle line:90%
to different timelines.

00:11:00.850 --> 00:11:03.690 align:middle line:84%
They're almost like
a ghost footprint

00:11:03.690 --> 00:11:08.160 align:middle line:84%
of metaphysical evidence
that reality isn't always

00:11:08.160 --> 00:11:12.930 align:middle line:84%
operating in a linear
past, present, and future.

00:11:12.930 --> 00:11:17.400 align:middle line:84%
But we become most aware
of this phenomenon the more

00:11:17.400 --> 00:11:18.640 align:middle line:90%
that we awaken.

00:11:18.640 --> 00:11:21.510 align:middle line:84%
And this is just a
common trope that we

00:11:21.510 --> 00:11:24.700 align:middle line:84%
see while we're going through
a spiritual awakening journey.

00:11:24.700 --> 00:11:27.210 align:middle line:84%
It's usually
something that people

00:11:27.210 --> 00:11:31.620 align:middle line:84%
notice who are already invested
in growing their awareness.

00:11:31.620 --> 00:11:36.330 align:middle line:84%
So, we become far
more conscious of all

00:11:36.330 --> 00:11:38.280 align:middle line:84%
of the different
intricacies and the ways

00:11:38.280 --> 00:11:43.170 align:middle line:84%
that reality is distorted around
whatever our current frequency

00:11:43.170 --> 00:11:46.620 align:middle line:90%
is of the collective.

00:11:46.620 --> 00:11:52.270 align:middle line:84%
When these collective memories
have large momentum behind them,

00:11:52.270 --> 00:11:54.810 align:middle line:84%
then what we actually
see is almost

00:11:54.810 --> 00:12:00.400 align:middle line:84%
like a conflict or a merger
between different timelines.

00:12:00.400 --> 00:12:02.800 align:middle line:84%
So, the natural
question becomes,

00:12:02.800 --> 00:12:07.170 align:middle line:84%
how does one timeline
absorb or merge

00:12:07.170 --> 00:12:09.480 align:middle line:90%
the other timelines into it?

00:12:09.480 --> 00:12:12.050 align:middle line:84%
And we can look at this
from the standpoint

00:12:12.050 --> 00:12:17.030 align:middle line:84%
of our collective frequency,
because the collective frequency

00:12:17.030 --> 00:12:18.920 align:middle line:84%
is what will
ultimately determine

00:12:18.920 --> 00:12:21.620 align:middle line:84%
what collective
memories actually

00:12:21.620 --> 00:12:24.530 align:middle line:90%
exist inside our timeline.

00:12:24.530 --> 00:12:27.380 align:middle line:84%
So this phenomenon
does not suggest

00:12:27.380 --> 00:12:31.560 align:middle line:84%
that one reality is more
real than the other version

00:12:31.560 --> 00:12:34.680 align:middle line:84%
and the other collective
memory of reality.

00:12:34.680 --> 00:12:37.910 align:middle line:84%
Instead, what this
is really pointing to

00:12:37.910 --> 00:12:42.150 align:middle line:84%
is that there are so many
alternate versions of reality,

00:12:42.150 --> 00:12:46.463 align:middle line:84%
and so many different versions
of how a timeline can manifest.

00:12:46.463 --> 00:12:50.420 align:middle line:90%


00:12:50.420 --> 00:12:53.810 align:middle line:84%
So all these different
subtle and major ways

00:12:53.810 --> 00:12:56.810 align:middle line:84%
that were affected
by this phenomenon

00:12:56.810 --> 00:13:00.620 align:middle line:84%
can also really lead us to a
larger and really philosophical

00:13:00.620 --> 00:13:05.570 align:middle line:84%
question, which is, what is
a dominant timeline anyways?

00:13:05.570 --> 00:13:08.540 align:middle line:10%
What if a dominant
timeline is just

00:13:08.540 --> 00:13:12.350 align:middle line:10%
the mosaic of multiple
versions of reality

00:13:12.350 --> 00:13:17.300 align:middle line:10%
that are all being projected
into one version of reality?

00:13:17.300 --> 00:13:20.210 align:middle line:84%
And so, instead of them
competing with one another,

00:13:20.210 --> 00:13:25.010 align:middle line:84%
they're all just contributing
to this one reality.

00:13:25.010 --> 00:13:27.760 align:middle line:84%
And then that dominant
timeline wouldn't even

00:13:27.760 --> 00:13:30.050 align:middle line:90%
be objective and linear.

00:13:30.050 --> 00:13:33.160 align:middle line:84%
It would be more like
a huge collaboration

00:13:33.160 --> 00:13:35.950 align:middle line:90%
of the whole multiverse.

00:13:35.950 --> 00:13:39.550 align:middle line:84%
So, what if all of those
versions of reality

00:13:39.550 --> 00:13:43.180 align:middle line:84%
are being projected
onto this timeline?

00:13:43.180 --> 00:13:49.000 align:middle line:84%
But that, whichever one that
we have the frequency that

00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:53.140 align:middle line:84%
is most in resonance to
experience and to perceive

00:13:53.140 --> 00:13:57.040 align:middle line:84%
is the one that gets
manifested, is the one that gets

00:13:57.040 --> 00:13:58.995 align:middle line:90%
actualized for us?

00:13:58.995 --> 00:14:04.120 align:middle line:90%


00:14:04.120 --> 00:14:09.010 align:middle line:84%
As we raise our frequency,
we could potentially

00:14:09.010 --> 00:14:12.700 align:middle line:84%
be more aware of all of
the different glitches,

00:14:12.700 --> 00:14:16.410 align:middle line:84%
of all of the different
versions of reality

00:14:16.410 --> 00:14:19.690 align:middle line:84%
that are projected onto
a dominant timeline.

00:14:19.690 --> 00:14:24.930 align:middle line:84%
So, even if we're experiencing a
very clear and objective version

00:14:24.930 --> 00:14:27.120 align:middle line:84%
of reality, which is
what we're calling

00:14:27.120 --> 00:14:31.590 align:middle line:84%
a dominant timeline, when
we continue to evolve

00:14:31.590 --> 00:14:35.550 align:middle line:84%
our consciousness and therefore
our frequency continues

00:14:35.550 --> 00:14:40.650 align:middle line:84%
to increase, we're starting to
see so many different layers

00:14:40.650 --> 00:14:42.250 align:middle line:90%
of reality.

00:14:42.250 --> 00:14:46.840 align:middle line:84%
And this is really what's
fun about the Mandela effect.

00:14:46.840 --> 00:14:50.730 align:middle line:84%
It's that free will
gives us the agency

00:14:50.730 --> 00:14:56.370 align:middle line:84%
to attract and have a
specific timeline move forward

00:14:56.370 --> 00:14:57.623 align:middle line:90%
into our reality.

00:14:57.623 --> 00:15:01.590 align:middle line:90%


00:15:01.590 --> 00:15:06.300 align:middle line:10%
So the more aware we become of
just how much our reality is

00:15:06.300 --> 00:15:09.450 align:middle line:10%
experiencing these
glitches, that

00:15:09.450 --> 00:15:12.150 align:middle line:10%
can put us into fear
sometimes because we

00:15:12.150 --> 00:15:15.770 align:middle line:10%
might start thinking that
now the powers that were

00:15:15.770 --> 00:15:19.960 align:middle line:10%
are doing things to manipulate
our reality beyond our control,

00:15:19.960 --> 00:15:24.360 align:middle line:10%
pointing to some futility
or disempowerment

00:15:24.360 --> 00:15:26.610 align:middle line:10%
that humanity has.

00:15:26.610 --> 00:15:29.730 align:middle line:84%
When, in fact, it's the
complete opposite, and sometimes

00:15:29.730 --> 00:15:32.820 align:middle line:84%
we just like to create
ideas to oppress ourselves.

00:15:32.820 --> 00:15:36.510 align:middle line:84%
In reality, the
Mandela effect is just

00:15:36.510 --> 00:15:39.090 align:middle line:84%
showing us how
aware we've become

00:15:39.090 --> 00:15:43.470 align:middle line:84%
to see that reality
itself is malleable.

00:15:43.470 --> 00:15:47.910 align:middle line:84%
Whatever way we make that
mean, and whatever way

00:15:47.910 --> 00:15:52.920 align:middle line:84%
we want to interact with that
truth that reality is malleable,

00:15:52.920 --> 00:15:58.350 align:middle line:84%
will be left up to each
of us individually.

00:15:58.350 --> 00:16:01.530 align:middle line:84%
So even though our
frequency is what

00:16:01.530 --> 00:16:05.770 align:middle line:84%
determines the dominant timeline
that we will be experiencing,

00:16:05.770 --> 00:16:10.870 align:middle line:84%
we also get so much free will
on what we make this all mean.

00:16:10.870 --> 00:16:13.710 align:middle line:84%
And that's really
the best indication

00:16:13.710 --> 00:16:16.620 align:middle line:84%
of when a person is in
their spiritual sovereignty.

00:16:16.620 --> 00:16:21.860 align:middle line:84%
And they use that sovereignty to
define what the Mandela effect

00:16:21.860 --> 00:16:25.010 align:middle line:84%
and what this phenomenon
means to them.

00:16:25.010 --> 00:16:28.490 align:middle line:84%
And they use that to
make it mean something

00:16:28.490 --> 00:16:32.690 align:middle line:84%
that is more empowering, and
possibly even more positive

00:16:32.690 --> 00:16:37.280 align:middle line:84%
than we would have
actually even perceived it.

00:16:37.280 --> 00:16:39.950 align:middle line:84%
The Mandela effect
reveals the profound truth

00:16:39.950 --> 00:16:44.990 align:middle line:84%
that reality is fluid, shaped
by the collective consciousness

00:16:44.990 --> 00:16:48.230 align:middle line:90%
and our vibrational state.

00:16:48.230 --> 00:16:50.580 align:middle line:84%
We're not just
passive observers.

00:16:50.580 --> 00:16:54.650 align:middle line:84%
Our consciousness is actively
creating and shifting

00:16:54.650 --> 00:16:57.110 align:middle line:90%
the world around us.

00:16:57.110 --> 00:17:01.070 align:middle line:84%
As we rise in frequency,
we unlock the power

00:17:01.070 --> 00:17:03.170 align:middle line:90%
to shape our timeline.

00:17:03.170 --> 00:17:08.480 align:middle line:84%
Stepping into a reality where
infinite possibilities exist.
