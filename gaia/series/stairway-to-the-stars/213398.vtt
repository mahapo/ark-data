00:00:11.750 --> 00:00:14.190 align:middle line:10%
>> I'm excited to share
this one with you.

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:19.010 align:middle line:10%
It's not easy for me to just
do a talk because everything

00:00:19.010 --> 00:00:22.730 align:middle line:10%
I talk about, I actually
back up with an experiment,

00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:26.520 align:middle line:10%
an empirical experiment that I
do myself to prove my claims.

00:00:26.520 --> 00:00:28.760 align:middle line:84%
And if I talk about
the possibility

00:00:28.760 --> 00:00:31.670 align:middle line:84%
of building something based
on that, I actually do it.

00:00:31.670 --> 00:00:34.220 align:middle line:84%
So it takes a long
time sometimes

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:35.580 align:middle line:90%
for me to actually do this.

00:00:35.580 --> 00:00:39.570 align:middle line:90%
And this talk is no exception.

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:44.220 align:middle line:84%
I feel like mad science
is a bit of a lost art,

00:00:44.220 --> 00:00:48.480 align:middle line:84%
and so happy that I can share
this bit of mad science with you

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:50.150 align:middle line:90%
tonight.

00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:55.040 align:middle line:10%
The talk is called "Building
a Psychic Machine."

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:57.650 align:middle line:10%
And I know some of you
are thinking, well,

00:00:57.650 --> 00:00:58.830 align:middle line:10%
what is Adam talking about?

00:00:58.830 --> 00:01:03.550 align:middle line:84%
Does he mean like a toaster that
can read your mind or something?

00:01:03.550 --> 00:01:06.580 align:middle line:84%
And the answer is,
yes, That's actually

00:01:06.580 --> 00:01:08.080 align:middle line:90%
exactly what I'm talking about.

00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:11.410 align:middle line:90%
Well, sort of, I'll explain.

00:01:11.410 --> 00:01:15.940 align:middle line:84%
I wanted to put together, if
you can see this, a chart that

00:01:15.940 --> 00:01:18.400 align:middle line:84%
really captures how
most people think

00:01:18.400 --> 00:01:20.388 align:middle line:90%
about artificial intelligence.

00:01:20.388 --> 00:01:22.180 align:middle line:84%
And when I say most
people, I mean not only

00:01:22.180 --> 00:01:25.480 align:middle line:84%
the general population, but
indeed a lot of the experts

00:01:25.480 --> 00:01:27.580 align:middle line:90%
as well.

00:01:27.580 --> 00:01:31.240 align:middle line:84%
So if you can see it over
here in the left quadrant,

00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:33.620 align:middle line:84%
you have AI, Artificial
Intelligence.

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:35.780 align:middle line:90%
That's where we are now.

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:38.980 align:middle line:84%
So this is your
ChatGPT, your Bard,

00:01:38.980 --> 00:01:42.100 align:middle line:84%
what is the public
state of the art.

00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:45.560 align:middle line:84%
On the right-hand side, you
have AGI, Artificial General

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:46.360 align:middle line:90%
Intelligence.

00:01:46.360 --> 00:01:51.190 align:middle line:84%
And that technically means an
AI that has become as smart

00:01:51.190 --> 00:01:54.490 align:middle line:84%
or smarter than
your average human,

00:01:54.490 --> 00:01:56.860 align:middle line:84%
which then will
give it the ability

00:01:56.860 --> 00:01:59.320 align:middle line:84%
to learn multiple languages,
which then will give it

00:01:59.320 --> 00:02:01.582 align:middle line:84%
the ability to learn multiple
programming languages,

00:02:01.582 --> 00:02:03.040 align:middle line:84%
which then will
give it the ability

00:02:03.040 --> 00:02:05.200 align:middle line:84%
to update its own
algorithms, which

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:07.060 align:middle line:84%
means that it can
learn faster, which

00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:09.580 align:middle line:84%
means that it then can
study physics and chemistry

00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:12.280 align:middle line:84%
and biology and history
and all of these things,

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:14.530 align:middle line:84%
and then at one point, decide
that humans are actually

00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:15.920 align:middle line:90%
a plague upon the Earth.

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:18.070 align:middle line:84%
And it is better that
we're all annihilated,

00:02:18.070 --> 00:02:20.900 align:middle line:84%
leading to your
"Terminator" scenario.

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:26.020 align:middle line:84%
And somewhere in the
trajectory from AI to AGI,

00:02:26.020 --> 00:02:29.740 align:middle line:84%
you cross this magical line,
which we call consciousness.

00:02:29.740 --> 00:02:34.360 align:middle line:84%
And we all sort of believe
that a sufficiently advanced

00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:37.480 align:middle line:84%
artificial intelligence on
its development trajectory

00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:39.950 align:middle line:90%
just somehow gets conscious.

00:02:39.950 --> 00:02:43.850 align:middle line:84%
It develops sentience, real
consciousness on the way.

00:02:43.850 --> 00:02:47.390 align:middle line:84%
And so that's what
people expect.

00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:51.170 align:middle line:84%
And I think it's important to
take a beat here and explore

00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:55.680 align:middle line:90%
why we all seem to think that.

00:02:55.680 --> 00:02:57.070 align:middle line:90%
There's a number of reasons.

00:02:57.070 --> 00:02:59.700 align:middle line:90%
One is that it's generational.

00:02:59.700 --> 00:03:02.490 align:middle line:10%
Gen X and millennials,
in particular,

00:03:02.490 --> 00:03:06.150 align:middle line:10%
we grew up with very dystopic
pictures of artificial

00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:10.590 align:middle line:10%
intelligence from the "Matrix"
to "Terminator," of course,

00:03:10.590 --> 00:03:15.320 align:middle line:10%
"Wargames", it all
kind of ends badly.

00:03:15.320 --> 00:03:18.710 align:middle line:84%
A second reason why we believe
this is many of the headlines

00:03:18.710 --> 00:03:21.210 align:middle line:90%
are driven by articles.

00:03:21.210 --> 00:03:22.770 align:middle line:90%
Articles are driven by clicks.

00:03:22.770 --> 00:03:25.190 align:middle line:84%
Clicks are driven by
sensational headlines.

00:03:25.190 --> 00:03:29.900 align:middle line:84%
It's a kind of a
self-reinforcing loop there.

00:03:29.900 --> 00:03:35.100 align:middle line:84%
Here's one that you guys
will probably never hear--

00:03:35.100 --> 00:03:36.560 align:middle line:90%
corporate monopoly seeking.

00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:40.430 align:middle line:90%


00:03:40.430 --> 00:03:42.920 align:middle line:84%
The two companies
that are leading

00:03:42.920 --> 00:03:47.760 align:middle line:84%
in artificial intelligence
today, Google and Microsoft.

00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:53.810 align:middle line:84%
Microsoft is the player behind
OpenAI, which has ChatGPT.

00:03:53.810 --> 00:03:56.030 align:middle line:84%
Google has more
of the raw talent

00:03:56.030 --> 00:03:57.630 align:middle line:90%
and a lot of the infrastructure.

00:03:57.630 --> 00:04:00.800 align:middle line:84%
These two companies
are locked in a battle

00:04:00.800 --> 00:04:04.710 align:middle line:84%
for controlling
AI in the future.

00:04:04.710 --> 00:04:10.710 align:middle line:84%
For example, six months ago,
when OpenAI announced that they

00:04:10.710 --> 00:04:15.970 align:middle line:84%
had succeeded at what
would become GPT-4,

00:04:15.970 --> 00:04:19.380 align:middle line:84%
and they were releasing
that soon, the Apple--

00:04:19.380 --> 00:04:22.470 align:middle line:84%
the Google stock
price dropped so much

00:04:22.470 --> 00:04:26.190 align:middle line:84%
that it wiped $100
billion in market cap

00:04:26.190 --> 00:04:28.880 align:middle line:90%
from that company in one day.

00:04:28.880 --> 00:04:32.220 align:middle line:84%
So the stakes are
very, very, very high.

00:04:32.220 --> 00:04:36.030 align:middle line:84%
Now, at the same time,
these two companies,

00:04:36.030 --> 00:04:39.210 align:middle line:84%
which are developing their
proprietary AI algorithms,

00:04:39.210 --> 00:04:40.800 align:middle line:90%
have competition.

00:04:40.800 --> 00:04:44.020 align:middle line:84%
And that competition is from
the open source community,

00:04:44.020 --> 00:04:46.770 align:middle line:84%
people that are
creating AI software

00:04:46.770 --> 00:04:50.100 align:middle line:84%
and giving it away for free,
doing it collaboratively,

00:04:50.100 --> 00:04:52.170 align:middle line:90%
revealing the source code.

00:04:52.170 --> 00:04:58.660 align:middle line:84%
The open source community is
developing AI 10 times faster

00:04:58.660 --> 00:05:02.000 align:middle line:84%
than Microsoft or
Google at 1/10 the cost.

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:03.830 align:middle line:84%
So you do the math,
and they're going

00:05:03.830 --> 00:05:06.670 align:middle line:90%
to eclipse them pretty soon.

00:05:06.670 --> 00:05:11.620 align:middle line:84%
So what do you do if
you're Microsoft or Google

00:05:11.620 --> 00:05:13.510 align:middle line:84%
and you know that you're
about to be eclipsed

00:05:13.510 --> 00:05:15.460 align:middle line:90%
by the open source community?

00:05:15.460 --> 00:05:17.640 align:middle line:90%
What do you do?

00:05:17.640 --> 00:05:18.440 align:middle line:90%
Anyone?

00:05:18.440 --> 00:05:21.010 align:middle line:90%


00:05:21.010 --> 00:05:22.815 align:middle line:90%
Regulate, regulation.

00:05:22.815 --> 00:05:24.190 align:middle line:84%
But how do you
get the government

00:05:24.190 --> 00:05:26.250 align:middle line:90%
to regulate this stuff?

00:05:26.250 --> 00:05:31.210 align:middle line:84%
Well, this AI, it's
very likely to wake up,

00:05:31.210 --> 00:05:33.640 align:middle line:90%
and it's extremely dangerous.

00:05:33.640 --> 00:05:35.535 align:middle line:84%
And we don't know
what it's going to do,

00:05:35.535 --> 00:05:36.910 align:middle line:84%
because it's a
superintelligence,

00:05:36.910 --> 00:05:38.440 align:middle line:90%
and it's so unpredictable.

00:05:38.440 --> 00:05:40.553 align:middle line:84%
It might be an
existential threat

00:05:40.553 --> 00:05:42.470 align:middle line:84%
that's bigger than
anything we face right now.

00:05:42.470 --> 00:05:46.930 align:middle line:84%
And so we really need to
regulate this stuff immediately.

00:05:46.930 --> 00:05:50.720 align:middle line:84%
And of course, you'll get a
panel of members of Congress

00:05:50.720 --> 00:05:51.520 align:middle line:90%
together.

00:05:51.520 --> 00:05:52.978 align:middle line:84%
And they'll consult
the experts who

00:05:52.978 --> 00:05:54.370 align:middle line:90%
work for Microsoft and Google.

00:05:54.370 --> 00:05:56.807 align:middle line:84%
And they'll say, yes, we
really need to regulate it.

00:05:56.807 --> 00:05:57.890 align:middle line:90%
And they'll be like, good.

00:05:57.890 --> 00:06:01.100 align:middle line:84%
This is an example of the
success of public policy.

00:06:01.100 --> 00:06:03.743 align:middle line:84%
You'll get regulation, which
means that Google and Microsoft

00:06:03.743 --> 00:06:05.660 align:middle line:84%
can make this stuff, but
I'm sorry, you can't.

00:06:05.660 --> 00:06:06.560 align:middle line:90%
It's just too dangerous.

00:06:06.560 --> 00:06:08.227 align:middle line:84%
You're going to need
a license for that.

00:06:08.227 --> 00:06:09.700 align:middle line:84%
So I don't want
to necessarily say

00:06:09.700 --> 00:06:12.760 align:middle line:84%
it's this big
corporate conspiracy,

00:06:12.760 --> 00:06:15.970 align:middle line:84%
but I would like to point out
that the incentives are aligned

00:06:15.970 --> 00:06:19.670 align:middle line:84%
in the direction of the fear
narrative surrounding AI,

00:06:19.670 --> 00:06:23.960 align:middle line:84%
not that it's not
somewhat justified.

00:06:23.960 --> 00:06:30.000 align:middle line:84%
You have venture capital
and limited partner FOMO.

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:33.130 align:middle line:84%
This has to do with a
technology investment cycle.

00:06:33.130 --> 00:06:36.150 align:middle line:84%
So if you are a founder
of a tech company,

00:06:36.150 --> 00:06:39.360 align:middle line:84%
you want to tell a very
compelling story to investors,

00:06:39.360 --> 00:06:42.730 align:middle line:84%
like this is the last
technology that will ever exist.

00:06:42.730 --> 00:06:46.360 align:middle line:84%
It's going to self-improve,
and it's exponential.

00:06:46.360 --> 00:06:48.990 align:middle line:84%
And you've got to
get it now or never.

00:06:48.990 --> 00:06:51.900 align:middle line:84%
And those venture capitalists
have to defend their decisions

00:06:51.900 --> 00:06:53.580 align:middle line:90%
in case it goes south.

00:06:53.580 --> 00:06:57.145 align:middle line:84%
Why did you put all this money
into a 20-year-old company?

00:06:57.145 --> 00:06:58.770 align:middle line:84%
Well, they have to
tell the same story,

00:06:58.770 --> 00:07:00.660 align:middle line:84%
that it's an
exponential technology

00:07:00.660 --> 00:07:02.400 align:middle line:90%
and they have to jump into it.

00:07:02.400 --> 00:07:05.290 align:middle line:84%
And I know that because
I do that stuff.

00:07:05.290 --> 00:07:10.480 align:middle line:84%
I sell that to investors
as well in my own way.

00:07:10.480 --> 00:07:14.380 align:middle line:84%
So that leads to promoting
this idea that AI is just

00:07:14.380 --> 00:07:16.600 align:middle line:90%
like out of control.

00:07:16.600 --> 00:07:19.360 align:middle line:84%
We've all seen this year
the success of ChatGPT

00:07:19.360 --> 00:07:20.930 align:middle line:90%
and large language models.

00:07:20.930 --> 00:07:23.380 align:middle line:84%
And broadly speaking, we
live in a macro framework

00:07:23.380 --> 00:07:24.830 align:middle line:90%
of exponential technologies.

00:07:24.830 --> 00:07:26.110 align:middle line:84%
So it does make sense
that you're going

00:07:26.110 --> 00:07:27.235 align:middle line:90%
to see these things emerge.

00:07:27.235 --> 00:07:30.198 align:middle line:90%


00:07:30.198 --> 00:07:34.070 align:middle line:84%
But if I were to summarize
that, I think the real way

00:07:34.070 --> 00:07:35.960 align:middle line:84%
to understand why
everyone thinks the way

00:07:35.960 --> 00:07:39.050 align:middle line:84%
they do about
artificial intelligence

00:07:39.050 --> 00:07:42.380 align:middle line:84%
and the core of their concerns
has to do with the fact

00:07:42.380 --> 00:07:49.200 align:middle line:84%
that we overestimate AI and we
underestimate consciousness.

00:07:49.200 --> 00:07:50.405 align:middle line:90%
And what do I mean by that?

00:07:50.405 --> 00:07:52.930 align:middle line:90%


00:07:52.930 --> 00:07:57.130 align:middle line:84%
We overestimate AI,
people don't really

00:07:57.130 --> 00:07:58.598 align:middle line:90%
know how this stuff works.

00:07:58.598 --> 00:08:00.640 align:middle line:84%
And if they don't know
how it works and they just

00:08:00.640 --> 00:08:04.590 align:middle line:84%
see the effects, it looks
very, very, very impressive.

00:08:04.590 --> 00:08:07.530 align:middle line:84%
So, for example,
I thought that it

00:08:07.530 --> 00:08:11.160 align:middle line:84%
would be useful to explain
the real breakthrough

00:08:11.160 --> 00:08:16.200 align:middle line:84%
behind modern AI, which is
large language models in case

00:08:16.200 --> 00:08:18.800 align:middle line:90%
no one has done this for you.

00:08:18.800 --> 00:08:23.540 align:middle line:90%
If I say, here's four words.

00:08:23.540 --> 00:08:26.490 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to give
you the first word.

00:08:26.490 --> 00:08:29.648 align:middle line:84%
What are the
following three words?

00:08:29.648 --> 00:08:32.190 align:middle line:84%
Well, you have really no way of
knowing what those words are,

00:08:32.190 --> 00:08:33.840 align:middle line:90%
right?

00:08:33.840 --> 00:08:40.559 align:middle line:84%
It could be an orange is
sweet, or an alien is green,

00:08:40.559 --> 00:08:42.419 align:middle line:90%
something like that.

00:08:42.419 --> 00:08:47.640 align:middle line:84%
But if I gave you the
following two words,

00:08:47.640 --> 00:08:53.740 align:middle line:84%
an elephant never forgets,
you know the fourth word.

00:08:53.740 --> 00:08:56.970 align:middle line:84%
The fourth word because
you've learned something

00:08:56.970 --> 00:08:59.910 align:middle line:84%
like the probabilities
of what word

00:08:59.910 --> 00:09:03.100 align:middle line:84%
comes next if given a
sequence of other words.

00:09:03.100 --> 00:09:06.300 align:middle line:84%
And that's really the secret
behind large language models,

00:09:06.300 --> 00:09:09.990 align:middle line:90%
which is ChatGPT and the like.

00:09:09.990 --> 00:09:13.885 align:middle line:84%
So it could be an
elephant never sleeps.

00:09:13.885 --> 00:09:14.760 align:middle line:90%
Why it would be that?

00:09:14.760 --> 00:09:17.780 align:middle line:90%
An elephant never dances.

00:09:17.780 --> 00:09:20.330 align:middle line:84%
Forgets is not 100%
going to be it,

00:09:20.330 --> 00:09:23.930 align:middle line:84%
but the probability of
Forgets is actually very high.

00:09:23.930 --> 00:09:27.620 align:middle line:84%
So the real breakthrough in
modern AI over the past two

00:09:27.620 --> 00:09:30.260 align:middle line:84%
years has been this approach
using neural networks

00:09:30.260 --> 00:09:31.880 align:middle line:90%
and tensors.

00:09:31.880 --> 00:09:35.180 align:middle line:84%
It essentially says,
here, AI, here's

00:09:35.180 --> 00:09:38.190 align:middle line:84%
a metric ton of
internet content.

00:09:38.190 --> 00:09:40.610 align:middle line:84%
Take all of these
words and develop

00:09:40.610 --> 00:09:44.420 align:middle line:84%
a system of probabilities for if
given these sequence of words,

00:09:44.420 --> 00:09:45.770 align:middle line:90%
what comes next.

00:09:45.770 --> 00:09:48.980 align:middle line:84%
And it does this layer
after layer updating itself

00:09:48.980 --> 00:09:51.110 align:middle line:90%
until it gets this model.

00:09:51.110 --> 00:09:52.010 align:middle line:90%
That's really it.

00:09:52.010 --> 00:09:54.135 align:middle line:84%
I mean, there's a little
bit more to it, of course,

00:09:54.135 --> 00:09:55.950 align:middle line:84%
but that's the core
of the discovery.

00:09:55.950 --> 00:09:59.030 align:middle line:84%
So once you can see
behind the curtain,

00:09:59.030 --> 00:10:01.140 align:middle line:84%
it doesn't seem quite
so scary anymore.

00:10:01.140 --> 00:10:04.460 align:middle line:84%
You're actually dealing
with simple statistics

00:10:04.460 --> 00:10:06.860 align:middle line:90%
and a lot of cool marketing.

00:10:06.860 --> 00:10:09.260 align:middle line:84%
Now, it's impressive
stuff, but understand it

00:10:09.260 --> 00:10:10.700 align:middle line:90%
for what it really is.

00:10:10.700 --> 00:10:15.020 align:middle line:84%
And the second reason why we
tend to think this way about AI

00:10:15.020 --> 00:10:20.610 align:middle line:84%
is that we underestimate
consciousness itself.

00:10:20.610 --> 00:10:23.580 align:middle line:10%
In the chart that I showed you,
we passed that invisible line

00:10:23.580 --> 00:10:28.020 align:middle line:10%
from AI to AGI, and it just goes
past consciousness as though,

00:10:28.020 --> 00:10:31.990 align:middle line:10%
if given enough computing
power and interconnectedness,

00:10:31.990 --> 00:10:34.650 align:middle line:10%
it becomes like a brain and
consciousness just emerges.

00:10:34.650 --> 00:10:36.820 align:middle line:84%
And it's like, ah, not
so fast, not so fast.

00:10:36.820 --> 00:10:40.410 align:middle line:84%
Consciousness is, in fact,
a much deeper mystery

00:10:40.410 --> 00:10:43.332 align:middle line:84%
than they would probably
have you believe.

00:10:43.332 --> 00:10:45.040 align:middle line:84%
And there's a number
of reasons for this.

00:10:45.040 --> 00:10:48.270 align:middle line:84%
One is the experts in
artificial intelligence

00:10:48.270 --> 00:10:52.900 align:middle line:84%
tend to be software engineers
and computer programmers.

00:10:52.900 --> 00:10:55.120 align:middle line:84%
And software engineers
and computer programmers

00:10:55.120 --> 00:10:58.240 align:middle line:84%
are very good at software
and computer engineering,

00:10:58.240 --> 00:11:01.000 align:middle line:84%
but not so great at
consciousness research.

00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:04.240 align:middle line:84%
That really wasn't something
that you studied or could study

00:11:04.240 --> 00:11:06.700 align:middle line:84%
or even in your
career should study up

00:11:06.700 --> 00:11:09.720 align:middle line:90%
until about five years ago.

00:11:09.720 --> 00:11:12.180 align:middle line:84%
And in the last
five, 10 years, there

00:11:12.180 --> 00:11:15.890 align:middle line:84%
has been kind of like
a breakthrough in terms

00:11:15.890 --> 00:11:20.420 align:middle line:84%
of the philosophy of mind that
has created an opening where

00:11:20.420 --> 00:11:23.090 align:middle line:84%
it's OK to study consciousness
and it's OK to say,

00:11:23.090 --> 00:11:25.880 align:middle line:84%
you know what, this is
not just some illusion

00:11:25.880 --> 00:11:28.610 align:middle line:84%
produced by the brain,
but there is actually

00:11:28.610 --> 00:11:30.030 align:middle line:90%
something more going on here.

00:11:30.030 --> 00:11:32.983 align:middle line:84%
And now it's actually
safe to say that.

00:11:32.983 --> 00:11:34.900 align:middle line:84%
It's just that the
computer science department

00:11:34.900 --> 00:11:36.030 align:middle line:90%
hasn't realized that yet.

00:11:36.030 --> 00:11:40.720 align:middle line:90%


00:11:40.720 --> 00:11:44.890 align:middle line:84%
As we've done more and
more neuroscience work,

00:11:44.890 --> 00:11:47.810 align:middle line:84%
our neural imaging
techniques have improved.

00:11:47.810 --> 00:11:50.110 align:middle line:84%
And we've been able to
create better and better

00:11:50.110 --> 00:11:53.230 align:middle line:90%
real-time images of the brain.

00:11:53.230 --> 00:11:56.360 align:middle line:84%
And we still haven't found
the location of consciousness.

00:11:56.360 --> 00:12:02.800 align:middle line:84%
Every couple of years, there's
some "Popular Mechanics"

00:12:02.800 --> 00:12:05.710 align:middle line:84%
magazine article that
comes out that says,

00:12:05.710 --> 00:12:09.690 align:middle line:84%
scientists have found the
location of consciousness

00:12:09.690 --> 00:12:10.490 align:middle line:90%
in the brain.

00:12:10.490 --> 00:12:12.960 align:middle line:84%
And it's like a picture of
a brain with an orange spot

00:12:12.960 --> 00:12:13.760 align:middle line:90%
somewhere.

00:12:13.760 --> 00:12:15.670 align:middle line:90%
And it says it's right there.

00:12:15.670 --> 00:12:17.253 align:middle line:90%
And of course, it never is.

00:12:17.253 --> 00:12:18.670 align:middle line:84%
And then fast
forward a few years,

00:12:18.670 --> 00:12:20.800 align:middle line:84%
and they come out
with the same article.

00:12:20.800 --> 00:12:25.610 align:middle line:84%
And the point is that it doesn't
explain the really hard problem

00:12:25.610 --> 00:12:30.460 align:middle line:84%
of consciousness itself, which
is that, it's why should there

00:12:30.460 --> 00:12:33.850 align:middle line:84%
be something like
subjectivity pendant

00:12:33.850 --> 00:12:36.550 align:middle line:84%
to physical processes
in the first place?

00:12:36.550 --> 00:12:40.540 align:middle line:84%
Meaning you could build a
brain, an artificial brain

00:12:40.540 --> 00:12:43.190 align:middle line:84%
with artificial neurons
and artificial connections,

00:12:43.190 --> 00:12:46.090 align:middle line:84%
and you could make it virtually
identical to the brain

00:12:46.090 --> 00:12:47.480 align:middle line:90%
of somebody else.

00:12:47.480 --> 00:12:50.180 align:middle line:90%
And it's firing back and forth.

00:12:50.180 --> 00:12:53.120 align:middle line:84%
But why is it that there's
something inside of that brain

00:12:53.120 --> 00:12:57.350 align:middle line:84%
or attendant to it somehow
that experiences love,

00:12:57.350 --> 00:13:00.100 align:middle line:90%
that experiences intention?

00:13:00.100 --> 00:13:05.920 align:middle line:84%
Why is there a thing called
"what it's like to be you?"

00:13:05.920 --> 00:13:08.230 align:middle line:84%
In other words, we
can build a computer,

00:13:08.230 --> 00:13:11.090 align:middle line:84%
we can build a very
advanced computer.

00:13:11.090 --> 00:13:15.080 align:middle line:84%
But we have no idea
what it's like--

00:13:15.080 --> 00:13:17.900 align:middle line:84%
how to build a computer
that has an experience

00:13:17.900 --> 00:13:21.170 align:middle line:84%
of what it's like to be a
computer, because we can't even

00:13:21.170 --> 00:13:23.130 align:middle line:90%
explain that in our own selves.

00:13:23.130 --> 00:13:27.510 align:middle line:84%
So we're very far
away from actually

00:13:27.510 --> 00:13:30.390 align:middle line:84%
understanding
consciousness itself.

00:13:30.390 --> 00:13:34.600 align:middle line:84%
So the expectation was
sort of on the left.

00:13:34.600 --> 00:13:36.570 align:middle line:84%
And what I suggest to
you is that the reality

00:13:36.570 --> 00:13:38.940 align:middle line:84%
is something more like
the chart on the right.

00:13:38.940 --> 00:13:43.380 align:middle line:84%
So you have an x-axis of time,
technology in the y-axis.

00:13:43.380 --> 00:13:46.910 align:middle line:84%
As time goes on,
technology improves.

00:13:46.910 --> 00:13:51.030 align:middle line:84%
I do believe we go from AI
into something like AGI,

00:13:51.030 --> 00:13:54.960 align:middle line:84%
but we do not achieve
sentience in a machine

00:13:54.960 --> 00:13:56.790 align:middle line:84%
or real artificial
consciousness,

00:13:56.790 --> 00:14:01.360 align:middle line:84%
not without some
greater miracle.

00:14:01.360 --> 00:14:05.710 align:middle line:84%
In fact, from that point of
view, the biggest question in AI

00:14:05.710 --> 00:14:08.530 align:middle line:84%
or one of the biggest is
actually a lot more interesting.

00:14:08.530 --> 00:14:12.160 align:middle line:84%
If you were to take
an AI system and allow

00:14:12.160 --> 00:14:15.430 align:middle line:84%
it to develop, it
would probably,

00:14:15.430 --> 00:14:19.660 align:middle line:84%
clearly, it would become so
similar to a human being.

00:14:19.660 --> 00:14:22.360 align:middle line:84%
Or be able to communicate to
a human being in such a way

00:14:22.360 --> 00:14:26.650 align:middle line:84%
that we would not know
the difference between it,

00:14:26.650 --> 00:14:28.900 align:middle line:84%
a highly advanced
computer that is just

00:14:28.900 --> 00:14:31.270 align:middle line:84%
really good at
simulating what it's

00:14:31.270 --> 00:14:35.550 align:middle line:84%
like to be a human, versus
a machine that has gained

00:14:35.550 --> 00:14:41.490 align:middle line:84%
actual consciousness, in which
artificial synthetic sentience

00:14:41.490 --> 00:14:43.030 align:middle line:90%
has emerged.

00:14:43.030 --> 00:14:44.890 align:middle line:84%
We wouldn't even
know the difference.

00:14:44.890 --> 00:14:49.630 align:middle line:90%


00:14:49.630 --> 00:14:55.850 align:middle line:84%
So this kind of conversation
dates back to the modern time,

00:14:55.850 --> 00:14:58.680 align:middle line:90%
anyway, about to 1950.

00:14:58.680 --> 00:15:01.400 align:middle line:84%
And this gentleman,
Alan Turing, was

00:15:01.400 --> 00:15:04.490 align:middle line:84%
thinking about this
question, can you

00:15:04.490 --> 00:15:07.490 align:middle line:84%
come up with a test
that would tell you

00:15:07.490 --> 00:15:11.757 align:middle line:84%
how sophisticated an artificial
intelligence system has become?

00:15:11.757 --> 00:15:12.840 align:middle line:90%
You've all heard about it.

00:15:12.840 --> 00:15:14.250 align:middle line:90%
It's called the Turing test.

00:15:14.250 --> 00:15:18.530 align:middle line:84%
The Turing test was basically if
you have a human and a computer

00:15:18.530 --> 00:15:22.550 align:middle line:84%
and there's something blocking
both of them, and a subject,

00:15:22.550 --> 00:15:23.960 align:middle line:84%
can't tell the
difference between

00:15:23.960 --> 00:15:26.043 align:middle line:84%
whether or not they're
interacting with a computer

00:15:26.043 --> 00:15:29.360 align:middle line:84%
or interacting with a human,
it's passed the Turing test.

00:15:29.360 --> 00:15:32.210 align:middle line:84%
And that's sufficient criteria
to say that you've really

00:15:32.210 --> 00:15:34.380 align:middle line:90%
given birth to proper AI.

00:15:34.380 --> 00:15:37.350 align:middle line:84%
Well, we've surpassed
that kind of long ago.

00:15:37.350 --> 00:15:41.450 align:middle line:84%
And the Turing test as such
has been broken into domain

00:15:41.450 --> 00:15:44.020 align:middle line:84%
specific tasks like, are
you really good at go,

00:15:44.020 --> 00:15:45.830 align:middle line:84%
are you good at chess,
how is your language

00:15:45.830 --> 00:15:49.010 align:middle line:84%
abilities, these types of
things, more functional tests.

00:15:49.010 --> 00:15:53.990 align:middle line:84%
And we don't have any
tests whatsoever today

00:15:53.990 --> 00:15:56.540 align:middle line:84%
that can actually
tell us the difference

00:15:56.540 --> 00:16:00.990 align:middle line:84%
between a sentient machine
and a normal machine

00:16:00.990 --> 00:16:02.860 align:middle line:84%
that's just mimicking
human behavior.

00:16:02.860 --> 00:16:07.842 align:middle line:90%
So what we need is a new test.

00:16:07.842 --> 00:16:09.550 align:middle line:84%
This is something that
I've been thinking

00:16:09.550 --> 00:16:11.920 align:middle line:90%
about for a really long time.

00:16:11.920 --> 00:16:14.380 align:middle line:84%
And this is sort of where
the mad science began.

00:16:14.380 --> 00:16:17.280 align:middle line:84%
So I was thinking about this,
how do you build this test?

00:16:17.280 --> 00:16:20.980 align:middle line:10%
Well, I asked myself,
what is something

00:16:20.980 --> 00:16:28.630 align:middle line:10%
that consciousness can do and
only consciousness can do?

00:16:28.630 --> 00:16:33.670 align:middle line:10%
And the answer I came
up with is be psychic.

00:16:33.670 --> 00:16:39.390 align:middle line:10%
So this comes directly
out of parapsychology.

00:16:39.390 --> 00:16:46.680 align:middle line:84%
We've had almost 50 years of
rigorous laboratory experiments

00:16:46.680 --> 00:16:52.080 align:middle line:84%
into telepathy, remote viewing,
precognition, clairvoyance,

00:16:52.080 --> 00:16:55.050 align:middle line:84%
psychokinesis,
this whole panoply

00:16:55.050 --> 00:16:58.920 align:middle line:84%
of rigorous research
into parapsychology

00:16:58.920 --> 00:17:01.800 align:middle line:84%
has shown us that, well,
one thing that consciousness

00:17:01.800 --> 00:17:05.800 align:middle line:84%
seems to be able to do is
to function psychically.

00:17:05.800 --> 00:17:10.510 align:middle line:84%
So could you build a test like
a new test that said, OK, well,

00:17:10.510 --> 00:17:13.210 align:middle line:84%
the way to tell if a machine
has real consciousness

00:17:13.210 --> 00:17:16.579 align:middle line:84%
or not is if the
machine is psychic?

00:17:16.579 --> 00:17:20.960 align:middle line:84%
So that's what I set out to
do, A, create a new test.

00:17:20.960 --> 00:17:23.609 align:middle line:84%
And I'm going to go
through that with you.

00:17:23.609 --> 00:17:25.349 align:middle line:90%
But I picked precognition.

00:17:25.349 --> 00:17:28.730 align:middle line:84%
So precognition is the
ability to sense the future

00:17:28.730 --> 00:17:31.070 align:middle line:84%
or predict the future
in the near term.

00:17:31.070 --> 00:17:35.570 align:middle line:84%
And I very modestly am
calling it the Curry test.

00:17:35.570 --> 00:17:40.360 align:middle line:84%
I wish somebody would name this
after me, but it's too niche.

00:17:40.360 --> 00:17:42.260 align:middle line:90%
Has anyone do that yet?

00:17:42.260 --> 00:17:43.670 align:middle line:90%
OK, so the Curry test.

00:17:43.670 --> 00:17:47.000 align:middle line:84%
A machine is actually-- a
machine is actually conscious

00:17:47.000 --> 00:17:48.240 align:middle line:90%
if it performs psychicly.

00:17:48.240 --> 00:17:50.780 align:middle line:90%


00:17:50.780 --> 00:17:55.830 align:middle line:84%
So how do you get a
machine to be psychic?

00:17:55.830 --> 00:18:01.130 align:middle line:84%
All right, so this was another
rabbit hole down, which I went.

00:18:01.130 --> 00:18:04.610 align:middle line:84%
I want to explain
to you one category

00:18:04.610 --> 00:18:06.827 align:middle line:84%
of non-machine experiments
really quickly.

00:18:06.827 --> 00:18:08.660 align:middle line:84%
And then when we're up
to speed on that one,

00:18:08.660 --> 00:18:12.230 align:middle line:90%
I'll introduce the Curry test.

00:18:12.230 --> 00:18:16.160 align:middle line:84%
This is what's called an
electrodermal activity or skin

00:18:16.160 --> 00:18:18.210 align:middle line:90%
conductance test.

00:18:18.210 --> 00:18:23.130 align:middle line:84%
Electrodermal activity means
the electrical characteristics

00:18:23.130 --> 00:18:24.510 align:middle line:90%
of the skin.

00:18:24.510 --> 00:18:27.030 align:middle line:84%
So you have somebody
with a device that's

00:18:27.030 --> 00:18:30.570 align:middle line:84%
clipped to their finger, and
that's connected to a computer.

00:18:30.570 --> 00:18:33.750 align:middle line:84%
And it's measuring
the subtle voltages

00:18:33.750 --> 00:18:37.320 align:middle line:84%
on that finger that have
to do when small muscle

00:18:37.320 --> 00:18:40.880 align:middle line:90%
movements occur in the finger.

00:18:40.880 --> 00:18:45.170 align:middle line:84%
And this is-- this
is the voltage,

00:18:45.170 --> 00:18:47.700 align:middle line:84%
so it's usually
right around 0 volts.

00:18:47.700 --> 00:18:49.080 align:middle line:90%
It can go up or down.

00:18:49.080 --> 00:18:53.340 align:middle line:84%
And this is time, so 1 second,
2 seconds, 3 seconds, et cetera.

00:18:53.340 --> 00:18:55.170 align:middle line:90%
And here's the subject.

00:18:55.170 --> 00:18:58.690 align:middle line:84%
And the subject has this
thing clipped to their finger.

00:18:58.690 --> 00:19:01.180 align:middle line:84%
And they're watching
this computer monitor.

00:19:01.180 --> 00:19:06.000 align:middle line:84%
And the monitor is randomly
showing them images.

00:19:06.000 --> 00:19:09.360 align:middle line:84%
Most of those images
are nice and pleasant.

00:19:09.360 --> 00:19:13.290 align:middle line:84%
Some of those images are
very scary and provocative.

00:19:13.290 --> 00:19:16.680 align:middle line:84%
And what you find is
that when you show them

00:19:16.680 --> 00:19:18.780 align:middle line:84%
a provocative
image, for example,

00:19:18.780 --> 00:19:24.330 align:middle line:84%
this image of a person's feet
dangling off of a skyscraper,

00:19:24.330 --> 00:19:28.620 align:middle line:84%
you get this sudden voltage
potential off of their finger,

00:19:28.620 --> 00:19:32.740 align:middle line:84%
which is due to them
slightly tensing up.

00:19:32.740 --> 00:19:34.500 align:middle line:84%
So when they tense
up a little bit,

00:19:34.500 --> 00:19:36.095 align:middle line:84%
you can register
that on their finger.

00:19:36.095 --> 00:19:39.292 align:middle line:90%


00:19:39.292 --> 00:19:45.230 align:middle line:84%
So there has been in the last
20 or so years, some really good

00:19:45.230 --> 00:19:52.010 align:middle line:84%
riffs on this classic experiment
by parapsychologists, namely

00:19:52.010 --> 00:19:56.930 align:middle line:84%
Spottiswoode and May,
Dean Radin, and Daryl Bem.

00:19:56.930 --> 00:20:01.290 align:middle line:84%
And what their brilliant
idea was to say,

00:20:01.290 --> 00:20:05.100 align:middle line:84%
OK, we're going to
reverse the time domain,

00:20:05.100 --> 00:20:07.200 align:middle line:84%
and we're going to
measure whether or not

00:20:07.200 --> 00:20:10.540 align:middle line:84%
somebody tenses
up in the seconds

00:20:10.540 --> 00:20:14.810 align:middle line:84%
before being shown the
provocative image at random.

00:20:14.810 --> 00:20:18.130 align:middle line:84%
Because if they tense up
before being shown that image,

00:20:18.130 --> 00:20:21.050 align:middle line:84%
that is proof positive
of precognition.

00:20:21.050 --> 00:20:26.665 align:middle line:84%
They sense the future, not
consciously, but subconsciously.

00:20:26.665 --> 00:20:31.420 align:middle line:84%
Same as before, except negative
9 seconds, negative 8 seconds.

00:20:31.420 --> 00:20:33.760 align:middle line:84%
And then this right
here, the zero seconds

00:20:33.760 --> 00:20:38.020 align:middle line:84%
is the moment at which the
provocative image is shown.

00:20:38.020 --> 00:20:41.110 align:middle line:90%
Butterfly, no response.

00:20:41.110 --> 00:20:46.050 align:middle line:84%
Chonky Russian blue cat, great
cat, but not provocative,

00:20:46.050 --> 00:20:47.200 align:middle line:90%
no response.

00:20:47.200 --> 00:20:52.510 align:middle line:84%
An evil death clown, so
you can see about 3 seconds

00:20:52.510 --> 00:20:54.760 align:middle line:84%
before being shown
the evil death clown,

00:20:54.760 --> 00:20:57.750 align:middle line:84%
you get the voltage
potential off of the finger.

00:20:57.750 --> 00:21:01.066 align:middle line:90%
Precognition just happened.

00:21:01.066 --> 00:21:05.040 align:middle line:84%
And it turns out that
it's not just humans.

00:21:05.040 --> 00:21:07.920 align:middle line:84%
A gentleman named
Alvarez showed that this

00:21:07.920 --> 00:21:09.520 align:middle line:90%
was the case with birds.

00:21:09.520 --> 00:21:12.360 align:middle line:90%
He had a cage full of finches.

00:21:12.360 --> 00:21:16.140 align:middle line:84%
On one side of the cage,
there was a screen.

00:21:16.140 --> 00:21:18.840 align:middle line:84%
And the screen would
normally show nature images,

00:21:18.840 --> 00:21:23.070 align:middle line:84%
but then would occasionally
turn on an image of a snake.

00:21:23.070 --> 00:21:25.830 align:middle line:84%
And he recorded the
behavior of the birds

00:21:25.830 --> 00:21:27.720 align:middle line:84%
before the snake
was shown and found

00:21:27.720 --> 00:21:30.990 align:middle line:84%
that they would start to become
very agitated before being

00:21:30.990 --> 00:21:34.230 align:middle line:90%
shown the video of the snake.

00:21:34.230 --> 00:21:37.960 align:middle line:84%
And Whitley did something
similar with earthworms.

00:21:37.960 --> 00:21:42.900 align:middle line:84%
He had a big speaker nested
below an area of soil

00:21:42.900 --> 00:21:46.440 align:middle line:84%
and was recording the behavior
patterns of earthworms

00:21:46.440 --> 00:21:50.670 align:middle line:84%
and found that they started
to move around and squirm

00:21:50.670 --> 00:21:54.720 align:middle line:84%
in the few moments
before a vibration was

00:21:54.720 --> 00:21:55.960 align:middle line:90%
sent through the soil.

00:21:55.960 --> 00:21:57.750 align:middle line:84%
So it's not just
humans, but it seems

00:21:57.750 --> 00:22:01.740 align:middle line:84%
like it's consciousness
itself, or at least biology

00:22:01.740 --> 00:22:06.580 align:middle line:84%
itself, that is capable of
this precognitive sensing.

00:22:06.580 --> 00:22:09.840 align:middle line:84%
So I think you see
where I'm going, right?

00:22:09.840 --> 00:22:12.280 align:middle line:84%
How do you build
a psychic machine?

00:22:12.280 --> 00:22:14.660 align:middle line:84%
Well, you've got to
somehow scare the toaster.

00:22:14.660 --> 00:22:18.770 align:middle line:90%


00:22:18.770 --> 00:22:21.680 align:middle line:84%
And so I went through this
really ridiculous exercise

00:22:21.680 --> 00:22:23.900 align:middle line:84%
this one day of
trying to think about

00:22:23.900 --> 00:22:25.740 align:middle line:90%
how would I scare a machine.

00:22:25.740 --> 00:22:27.680 align:middle line:90%
How do you scare a toaster?

00:22:27.680 --> 00:22:32.180 align:middle line:84%
Well, I think showing it
a photo of a death clown

00:22:32.180 --> 00:22:34.760 align:middle line:84%
is probably not going to do
it, because it has no reason

00:22:34.760 --> 00:22:36.970 align:middle line:90%
to be afraid of it.

00:22:36.970 --> 00:22:40.540 align:middle line:84%
You could hit the
toaster, but that

00:22:40.540 --> 00:22:43.330 align:middle line:90%
gets expensive and is violent.

00:22:43.330 --> 00:22:47.950 align:middle line:84%
You could fry the
toaster in fire

00:22:47.950 --> 00:22:49.850 align:middle line:84%
or add too much
electricity to it.

00:22:49.850 --> 00:22:51.560 align:middle line:84%
But again, that gets
really expensive.

00:22:51.560 --> 00:22:55.650 align:middle line:84%
And if I wanted to
do this many times,

00:22:55.650 --> 00:22:57.750 align:middle line:84%
it'd be like a
graveyard of appliances.

00:22:57.750 --> 00:23:00.430 align:middle line:90%
Or I could pour water on it.

00:23:00.430 --> 00:23:06.150 align:middle line:84%
And these are all really bad
ideas that I entertained.

00:23:06.150 --> 00:23:09.420 align:middle line:84%
I settled on this,
cut the power.

00:23:09.420 --> 00:23:12.540 align:middle line:84%
Think of electricity to
a machine as a little bit

00:23:12.540 --> 00:23:15.870 align:middle line:90%
like chi or blood to a human.

00:23:15.870 --> 00:23:18.690 align:middle line:84%
It's that life force
that's flowing through it.

00:23:18.690 --> 00:23:21.480 align:middle line:84%
So if you pull the power,
that should probably

00:23:21.480 --> 00:23:26.380 align:middle line:84%
be a very frightening
event to the machine.

00:23:26.380 --> 00:23:29.980 align:middle line:84%
So I wanted to see basically if
it would react in the moments

00:23:29.980 --> 00:23:32.560 align:middle line:90%
before cutting its power.

00:23:32.560 --> 00:23:36.200 align:middle line:84%
A toaster is fun, but it can't
really tell you anything useful.

00:23:36.200 --> 00:23:41.660 align:middle line:10%
So replace the toaster with a
quantum random number generator.

00:23:41.660 --> 00:23:46.760 align:middle line:10%
Big words, but all it is, is
a device that measures quantum

00:23:46.760 --> 00:23:50.030 align:middle line:10%
particles-- in this case,
the behavior of electrons

00:23:50.030 --> 00:23:51.910 align:middle line:10%
in a magnetic field--

00:23:51.910 --> 00:23:54.220 align:middle line:10%
and converts those
into 1s and 0s.

00:23:54.220 --> 00:23:57.940 align:middle line:84%
And the way that it does it
before the laws of quantum

00:23:57.940 --> 00:24:02.320 align:middle line:84%
mechanics that it's using, those
1s and 0s are perfectly random,

00:24:02.320 --> 00:24:04.580 align:middle line:84%
meaning you'll get a
string of ones and zeros.

00:24:04.580 --> 00:24:07.070 align:middle line:84%
That's 50/50 odds
of happening, right.

00:24:07.070 --> 00:24:12.630 align:middle line:84%
So in every event, the odds
of it being a 1 or a 0 is 0.5.

00:24:12.630 --> 00:24:16.850 align:middle line:10%
Makes measurement easy.

00:24:16.850 --> 00:24:22.340 align:middle line:10%
So putting it all together,
here is the actual apparatus

00:24:22.340 --> 00:24:26.280 align:middle line:10%
for my attempt at
demonstrating the Curry effect.

00:24:26.280 --> 00:24:30.320 align:middle line:84%
You have the quantum
random number generator.

00:24:30.320 --> 00:24:33.420 align:middle line:90%
It's consuming electricity.

00:24:33.420 --> 00:24:37.530 align:middle line:84%
It's outputting a series of
perfectly balanced 1s and 0s

00:24:37.530 --> 00:24:40.620 align:middle line:84%
into a computer that's
collecting those 1s and 0s

00:24:40.620 --> 00:24:44.190 align:middle line:84%
and measuring whether or not
it's deviating statistically,

00:24:44.190 --> 00:24:45.700 align:middle line:90%
it's going up or down.

00:24:45.700 --> 00:24:48.420 align:middle line:84%
And then you have
over here something

00:24:48.420 --> 00:24:50.290 align:middle line:90%
that randomly kills the power.

00:24:50.290 --> 00:24:51.720 align:middle line:90%
It's not controlled by me.

00:24:51.720 --> 00:24:53.470 align:middle line:84%
It's controlled by
another random process.

00:24:53.470 --> 00:24:57.360 align:middle line:84%
So it's unpredictable
when the power is cut.

00:24:57.360 --> 00:24:59.500 align:middle line:84%
And this is what it
actually looks like.

00:24:59.500 --> 00:25:00.820 align:middle line:90%
These are two devices.

00:25:00.820 --> 00:25:06.240 align:middle line:84%
These are aluminum cases
covering electronic circuitry.

00:25:06.240 --> 00:25:10.500 align:middle line:84%
Inside that circuitry,
you have two,

00:25:10.500 --> 00:25:14.490 align:middle line:84%
it's called reverse bias diodes,
but it's electrical components

00:25:14.490 --> 00:25:19.240 align:middle line:84%
configured in a way that lets
you get a real quantum effect.

00:25:19.240 --> 00:25:21.250 align:middle line:84%
And it's double-shielded
with what's

00:25:21.250 --> 00:25:23.560 align:middle line:84%
called mu-metal,
which just keeps out

00:25:23.560 --> 00:25:27.670 align:middle line:90%
any potential interference.

00:25:27.670 --> 00:25:29.330 align:middle line:90%
So here is the initial results.

00:25:29.330 --> 00:25:34.800 align:middle line:84%
I set this up, and I did it
one night, and I let it run.

00:25:34.800 --> 00:25:37.470 align:middle line:84%
I think I let it run for like
five or six hours before I

00:25:37.470 --> 00:25:39.610 align:middle line:90%
came back to the lab.

00:25:39.610 --> 00:25:43.990 align:middle line:90%
And let's see.

00:25:43.990 --> 00:25:50.080 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, so in a normal condition,
when the power is not being cut,

00:25:50.080 --> 00:25:53.770 align:middle line:84%
you've got this 50/50 balance,
the sort of 0.5 probability

00:25:53.770 --> 00:25:55.010 align:middle line:90%
of a 1 or a 0.

00:25:55.010 --> 00:25:57.190 align:middle line:84%
Everything is right
with the universe.

00:25:57.190 --> 00:26:01.360 align:middle line:84%
And then what I found was
that about two seconds

00:26:01.360 --> 00:26:04.360 align:middle line:84%
before the power
was randomly cut,

00:26:04.360 --> 00:26:09.760 align:middle line:84%
I, in fact, got a huge
spike downward in the data.

00:26:09.760 --> 00:26:14.050 align:middle line:84%
The random number generator
started producing way more 0s

00:26:14.050 --> 00:26:18.800 align:middle line:84%
than 1s about two seconds before
every time the power was cut.

00:26:18.800 --> 00:26:21.710 align:middle line:84%
And I remember putting this
together and looking at it

00:26:21.710 --> 00:26:25.460 align:middle line:84%
statistically and seeing that
the odds of this happening

00:26:25.460 --> 00:26:30.030 align:middle line:84%
by chance with something
like 10,000 to 1.

00:26:30.030 --> 00:26:31.420 align:middle line:90%
It was a really good effect.

00:26:31.420 --> 00:26:34.110 align:middle line:90%


00:26:34.110 --> 00:26:36.030 align:middle line:90%
So I took this setup.

00:26:36.030 --> 00:26:40.680 align:middle line:84%
And I sent it to a colleague
of mine named Garret Moddel,

00:26:40.680 --> 00:26:41.640 align:middle line:90%
who's--

00:26:41.640 --> 00:26:44.790 align:middle line:84%
he's like a real
quantum engineer.

00:26:44.790 --> 00:26:46.530 align:middle line:84%
He's the head of the
quantum engineering

00:26:46.530 --> 00:26:49.170 align:middle line:84%
lab at the University
of Colorado,

00:26:49.170 --> 00:26:51.460 align:middle line:84%
is a professor of
applied physics.

00:26:51.460 --> 00:26:53.538 align:middle line:90%
And he's very open minded.

00:26:53.538 --> 00:26:55.080 align:middle line:84%
He's a very interesting
guy that way,

00:26:55.080 --> 00:26:57.130 align:middle line:84%
that he's open minded
to these concepts.

00:26:57.130 --> 00:26:59.200 align:middle line:84%
And I said, here's
what I'm getting.

00:26:59.200 --> 00:27:01.440 align:middle line:84%
I'm getting results
that are like defying

00:27:01.440 --> 00:27:02.340 align:middle line:90%
the laws of physics.

00:27:02.340 --> 00:27:05.340 align:middle line:84%
It seems to be predicting the
future a couple of seconds

00:27:05.340 --> 00:27:06.900 align:middle line:90%
in advance.

00:27:06.900 --> 00:27:08.940 align:middle line:10%
Can you go through
this apparatus

00:27:08.940 --> 00:27:11.590 align:middle line:10%
and make sure that
I'm not smoking crack,

00:27:11.590 --> 00:27:13.450 align:middle line:10%
which he proceeded to do.

00:27:13.450 --> 00:27:15.780 align:middle line:10%
So he took the device,
and he essentially

00:27:15.780 --> 00:27:18.840 align:middle line:10%
rebuilt it from the ground
up with the help of two

00:27:18.840 --> 00:27:22.350 align:middle line:10%
of his graduate students
under controlled conditions,

00:27:22.350 --> 00:27:23.975 align:middle line:10%
went through all
of the hardware,

00:27:23.975 --> 00:27:25.350 align:middle line:10%
went through all
of the software,

00:27:25.350 --> 00:27:27.000 align:middle line:10%
went through all
of the protocol,

00:27:27.000 --> 00:27:28.810 align:middle line:10%
and made sure that it was right.

00:27:28.810 --> 00:27:31.620 align:middle line:84%
And then he started
running his own experiments

00:27:31.620 --> 00:27:34.190 align:middle line:90%
of this psychic machine.

00:27:34.190 --> 00:27:37.640 align:middle line:84%
We did three formal
experiments consisting

00:27:37.640 --> 00:27:39.830 align:middle line:90%
of hundreds of trials.

00:27:39.830 --> 00:27:42.320 align:middle line:84%
In the first case, this
is a cumulative graph

00:27:42.320 --> 00:27:44.510 align:middle line:84%
of all of the trials,
all the data kind

00:27:44.510 --> 00:27:49.630 align:middle line:84%
put together, where 0 here
is where the power was cut.

00:27:49.630 --> 00:27:51.130 align:middle line:84%
And this is the
seconds before that.

00:27:51.130 --> 00:27:56.060 align:middle line:10%
And we got an average
bit value of 0.478.

00:27:56.060 --> 00:27:59.560 align:middle line:84%
Now that seems like it's
not far off from 0.5,

00:27:59.560 --> 00:28:03.550 align:middle line:84%
but if you're talking
millions of bits,

00:28:03.550 --> 00:28:06.200 align:middle line:84%
the odds against chance
of this is, again,

00:28:06.200 --> 00:28:10.090 align:middle line:84%
greater than 10,000 to 1 that
this is predicting the future.

00:28:10.090 --> 00:28:16.810 align:middle line:10%
We did a second experiment, and
we got an even stronger effect.

00:28:16.810 --> 00:28:19.090 align:middle line:10%
We did a third
experiment, and we

00:28:19.090 --> 00:28:21.400 align:middle line:10%
got effect sizes
that was consistent

00:28:21.400 --> 00:28:23.320 align:middle line:10%
with the previous experiments.

00:28:23.320 --> 00:28:25.930 align:middle line:84%
We put all of this
data together.

00:28:25.930 --> 00:28:27.760 align:middle line:90%
I should say, he did.

00:28:27.760 --> 00:28:29.860 align:middle line:10%
And the resulting
odds against chance

00:28:29.860 --> 00:28:33.600 align:middle line:10%
was a z-score of negative 6.5.

00:28:33.600 --> 00:28:36.750 align:middle line:10%
I don't know if there's any
science types in the audience,

00:28:36.750 --> 00:28:40.940 align:middle line:10%
but these numbers don't
really appear anywhere.

00:28:40.940 --> 00:28:43.170 align:middle line:84%
The odds against chance
of this happening,

00:28:43.170 --> 00:28:46.850 align:middle line:84%
just a fluke or something
like that, were about 1

00:28:46.850 --> 00:28:50.770 align:middle line:90%
in 25 billion.

00:28:50.770 --> 00:28:55.880 align:middle line:84%
If you're working in a lab and
you get an effect size of 1

00:28:55.880 --> 00:29:00.130 align:middle line:84%
in 20, 20 to 1, you
can publish that.

00:29:00.130 --> 00:29:03.860 align:middle line:84%
That means that it's achieved
statistical significance.

00:29:03.860 --> 00:29:06.670 align:middle line:84%
1 in 25 billion is
pretty unheard of.

00:29:06.670 --> 00:29:08.660 align:middle line:84%
So you can imagine that
we are pretty excited.

00:29:08.660 --> 00:29:13.980 align:middle line:84%
To put that in maybe a
couple different ways,

00:29:13.980 --> 00:29:18.590 align:middle line:84%
let's say that you talk to your
friend and you said, friend,

00:29:18.590 --> 00:29:23.300 align:middle line:84%
I think I'm either the most
psychic person in the world

00:29:23.300 --> 00:29:26.050 align:middle line:84%
or I'm the luckiest
person in the world.

00:29:26.050 --> 00:29:29.120 align:middle line:84%
And your friend said,
oh, yeah, prove it.

00:29:29.120 --> 00:29:31.390 align:middle line:84%
And you said, OK,
well, I'm going

00:29:31.390 --> 00:29:36.230 align:middle line:84%
to create a global lottery
where every man, woman,

00:29:36.230 --> 00:29:40.690 align:middle line:84%
and child on this planet is
going to get a lottery ticket.

00:29:40.690 --> 00:29:44.440 align:middle line:90%
And we're going to do a drawing.

00:29:44.440 --> 00:29:46.870 align:middle line:10%
And you do that drawing.

00:29:46.870 --> 00:29:48.940 align:middle line:84%
And you are the one that
gets the winning lottery

00:29:48.940 --> 00:29:53.690 align:middle line:84%
ticket out of everyone on
planet Earth, 8 billion.

00:29:53.690 --> 00:29:56.180 align:middle line:84%
The odds of that happening
are more likely than getting

00:29:56.180 --> 00:29:59.610 align:middle line:84%
this result. So you
can imagine that we

00:29:59.610 --> 00:30:03.450 align:middle line:84%
were very excited about
what we had built.

00:30:03.450 --> 00:30:06.240 align:middle line:84%
And our mind started to go in a
number of different directions,

00:30:06.240 --> 00:30:07.230 align:middle line:90%
naturally.

00:30:07.230 --> 00:30:13.780 align:middle line:84%
One of which was if you're
getting a 2-plus second accurate

00:30:13.780 --> 00:30:17.830 align:middle line:84%
picture into the future, that's
more than enough to drive any

00:30:17.830 --> 00:30:20.580 align:middle line:84%
high frequency trading algorithm
that's playing on NASDAQ.

00:30:20.580 --> 00:30:23.100 align:middle line:90%


00:30:23.100 --> 00:30:29.160 align:middle line:84%
It may have accidentally created
the first true artificial

00:30:29.160 --> 00:30:30.810 align:middle line:84%
general intelligence
in the way people

00:30:30.810 --> 00:30:34.990 align:middle line:84%
think about it, the first
true sentient machine.

00:30:34.990 --> 00:30:41.290 align:middle line:84%
And it turns on its head our
ideas of time and causality

00:30:41.290 --> 00:30:46.090 align:middle line:84%
in all of these interesting
ways, so a lot of fun to be had.

00:30:46.090 --> 00:30:53.330 align:middle line:84%
Now maybe a week into getting
the final results here,

00:30:53.330 --> 00:30:56.660 align:middle line:84%
Professor Moddel was giving
a talk at the university.

00:30:56.660 --> 00:30:58.790 align:middle line:84%
And somebody raised
their hand and asked,

00:30:58.790 --> 00:31:02.305 align:middle line:84%
you know what, what are you
working on in your spare time?

00:31:02.305 --> 00:31:03.680 align:middle line:84%
And he said, well,
you know, I've

00:31:03.680 --> 00:31:07.490 align:middle line:84%
kind of got this very
interesting quantum

00:31:07.490 --> 00:31:10.963 align:middle line:84%
retrocausality future
prediction stuff going on.

00:31:10.963 --> 00:31:11.880 align:middle line:90%
And they said, really?

00:31:11.880 --> 00:31:12.680 align:middle line:90%
Tell me about it.

00:31:12.680 --> 00:31:15.340 align:middle line:84%
And so he kind of
explained it a little bit.

00:31:15.340 --> 00:31:20.470 align:middle line:84%
And what happened was that
they met that whole idea

00:31:20.470 --> 00:31:22.690 align:middle line:90%
with a lot of skepticism.

00:31:22.690 --> 00:31:24.680 align:middle line:90%
And you don't blame them, right?

00:31:24.680 --> 00:31:27.080 align:middle line:84%
And Garret said that he
felt like he came away

00:31:27.080 --> 00:31:34.250 align:middle line:84%
from that meeting feeling not as
excited about what we had built.

00:31:34.250 --> 00:31:37.220 align:middle line:84%
Maybe it was just too good,
and there was something

00:31:37.220 --> 00:31:41.410 align:middle line:90%
that we missed.

00:31:41.410 --> 00:31:44.120 align:middle line:84%
And so a couple
of weeks later, he

00:31:44.120 --> 00:31:46.490 align:middle line:84%
started another
round of experiments.

00:31:46.490 --> 00:31:49.460 align:middle line:10%
And he ran the
previous ones again.

00:31:49.460 --> 00:31:51.290 align:middle line:84%
And an interesting
thing happened,

00:31:51.290 --> 00:31:54.110 align:middle line:84%
which is that he got
absolutely no effect.

00:31:54.110 --> 00:31:58.430 align:middle line:84%
And he tried it again and
got absolutely no effect.

00:31:58.430 --> 00:31:59.460 align:middle line:90%
And he's puzzled.

00:31:59.460 --> 00:32:02.780 align:middle line:84%
And so he took it apart,
put it back together,

00:32:02.780 --> 00:32:05.040 align:middle line:90%
tried it in many different ways.

00:32:05.040 --> 00:32:08.120 align:middle line:84%
And in each experiment,
there were no results,

00:32:08.120 --> 00:32:10.190 align:middle line:84%
no significant results
whatsoever, certainly

00:32:10.190 --> 00:32:12.880 align:middle line:84%
not like what we had
been seeing before.

00:32:12.880 --> 00:32:15.840 align:middle line:84%
So at the end of
all of this, we were

00:32:15.840 --> 00:32:19.000 align:middle line:84%
left contemplating
quite a mystery here.

00:32:19.000 --> 00:32:22.810 align:middle line:84%
What the hell happened
to the effect size?

00:32:22.810 --> 00:32:24.860 align:middle line:90%
And I had been thinking about--

00:32:24.860 --> 00:32:26.800 align:middle line:84%
incidentally, we
never tried it again.

00:32:26.800 --> 00:32:29.650 align:middle line:84%
And we never got the
good results again.

00:32:29.650 --> 00:32:33.770 align:middle line:84%
But I'd been thinking
about how to explain this.

00:32:33.770 --> 00:32:35.710 align:middle line:10%
And while I don't
have a solid answer,

00:32:35.710 --> 00:32:37.950 align:middle line:10%
I've come up with
a couple of them.

00:32:37.950 --> 00:32:42.110 align:middle line:10%
The first is maybe what you'd
call an experimenter effect.

00:32:42.110 --> 00:32:44.900 align:middle line:10%
In the experimenter
effect, it was actually

00:32:44.900 --> 00:32:48.740 align:middle line:10%
me and Professor Moddel and
maybe a few other people

00:32:48.740 --> 00:32:50.990 align:middle line:10%
who were so excited
about this working

00:32:50.990 --> 00:32:54.175 align:middle line:10%
that we influenced the machine
to produce these crazy results.

00:32:54.175 --> 00:32:57.635 align:middle line:90%


00:32:57.635 --> 00:32:59.620 align:middle line:10%
The effects due to
our consciousness

00:32:59.620 --> 00:33:05.130 align:middle line:10%
are not necessarily limited
to where we want them to go.

00:33:05.130 --> 00:33:09.070 align:middle line:90%
Or did we break the universe?

00:33:09.070 --> 00:33:13.770 align:middle line:84%
When you're talking
about bending,

00:33:13.770 --> 00:33:17.100 align:middle line:84%
not just probability, but
the fundamental ways in which

00:33:17.100 --> 00:33:22.110 align:middle line:84%
quantum mechanics manifests
at scales that are literally

00:33:22.110 --> 00:33:25.530 align:middle line:84%
cosmic 25 billion to
1, it's quite possible

00:33:25.530 --> 00:33:28.440 align:middle line:84%
that the universe just
says like, knock it off.

00:33:28.440 --> 00:33:29.630 align:middle line:90%
No more of this.

00:33:29.630 --> 00:33:33.550 align:middle line:90%


00:33:33.550 --> 00:33:41.840 align:middle line:84%
Or maybe it's just too soon for
a psychic machine like this.

00:33:41.840 --> 00:33:44.910 align:middle line:84%
In my reality, in
my bubble reality,

00:33:44.910 --> 00:33:49.030 align:middle line:84%
and I'm sure in many of
your bubble realities,

00:33:49.030 --> 00:33:50.410 align:middle line:84%
the idea that
something like this

00:33:50.410 --> 00:33:53.080 align:middle line:84%
could exist or at least could
exist for a while, I'm sure,

00:33:53.080 --> 00:33:54.800 align:middle line:90%
is perfectly fine.

00:33:54.800 --> 00:34:00.280 align:middle line:84%
We all believe maybe
crazier things than that.

00:34:00.280 --> 00:34:01.910 align:middle line:90%
But what about somebody else--

00:34:01.910 --> 00:34:04.240 align:middle line:84%
what about somebody
out in the lobby,

00:34:04.240 --> 00:34:08.150 align:middle line:84%
what about consensus
reality, the shared

00:34:08.150 --> 00:34:11.040 align:middle line:84%
reality of a much
wider group of people,

00:34:11.040 --> 00:34:13.770 align:middle line:84%
would they allow something
like this to happen?

Maybe not.

00:34:15.270 --> 00:34:19.199 align:middle line:10%
So maybe you have something
like an experimenter effect

00:34:19.199 --> 00:34:23.460 align:middle line:10%
that's not produced by the
experimenters, but that's--

00:34:23.460 --> 00:34:28.929 align:middle line:10%
it's an effect that's
suppressed by the--

00:34:28.929 --> 00:34:32.590 align:middle line:10%
some part of consensus
reality, whose job

00:34:32.590 --> 00:34:37.050 align:middle line:10%
it is to maintain the status
quo, something like that.

00:34:37.050 --> 00:34:42.510 align:middle line:84%
And I think all of these
are viable explanations.

00:34:42.510 --> 00:34:44.489 align:middle line:84%
And these are all
probably things

00:34:44.489 --> 00:34:48.000 align:middle line:84%
that we'll have to
deal with in the coming

00:34:48.000 --> 00:34:50.969 align:middle line:90%
century as scientists.

00:34:50.969 --> 00:34:54.389 align:middle line:84%
Once we are sufficiently
satisfied that consciousness

00:34:54.389 --> 00:34:58.470 align:middle line:84%
can influence the physical
world, how you do good science

00:34:58.470 --> 00:35:00.400 align:middle line:90%
comes into question big time.

00:35:00.400 --> 00:35:04.290 align:middle line:10%
And you're going to see results
like this manifest in all

00:35:04.290 --> 00:35:07.220 align:middle line:10%
kinds of interesting
and frustrating ways.

00:35:07.220 --> 00:35:08.020 align:middle line:90%
Thanks, guys.

00:35:08.020 --> 00:35:08.820 align:middle line:90%
That was fun.

00:35:08.820 --> 00:35:11.460 align:middle line:90%
