[THEME MUSIC]

00:00:07.696 --> 00:00:11.544 align:middle line:90%


00:00:11.544 --> 00:00:15.970 align:middle line:84%
>> All right, so now we'll get
into the Coneheads a little bit.

00:00:15.970 --> 00:00:17.250 align:middle line:90%
There we go.

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:24.206 align:middle line:10%
So you go particularly
around Paracas in Peru,

00:00:24.206 --> 00:00:25.770 align:middle line:10%
it's a very desert area.

00:00:25.770 --> 00:00:27.820 align:middle line:84%
And there's a lot of
pyramids around there.

00:00:27.820 --> 00:00:30.930 align:middle line:84%
And this is where they excavate
many of these Coneheads

00:00:30.930 --> 00:00:32.500 align:middle line:90%
with the elongated heads.

00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:34.510 align:middle line:84%
And some of them are
pretty astonishing.

00:00:34.510 --> 00:00:36.400 align:middle line:90%
They have the elongated heads.

00:00:36.400 --> 00:00:38.650 align:middle line:90%
They also have that in Tiwanaku.

00:00:38.650 --> 00:00:41.250 align:middle line:84%
They're all over the
world, these Conehead

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:42.490 align:middle line:90%
and elongated guys.

00:00:42.490 --> 00:00:44.890 align:middle line:90%
And it's pretty astonishing.

00:00:44.890 --> 00:00:46.150 align:middle line:90%
This is one of them.

00:00:46.150 --> 00:00:49.470 align:middle line:84%
This guy is extremely
elongated head.

00:00:49.470 --> 00:00:52.740 align:middle line:84%
He's from the pyramid
of Chongos, which

00:00:52.740 --> 00:00:55.890 align:middle line:90%
is in the interior of Paracas.

00:00:55.890 --> 00:01:00.740 align:middle line:84%
Here's an X-ray of one of
those elongated heads and stuff

00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:01.540 align:middle line:90%
like that.

00:01:01.540 --> 00:01:03.190 align:middle line:90%
So this is totally real.

00:01:03.190 --> 00:01:04.410 align:middle line:90%
I mean, there's no--

00:01:04.410 --> 00:01:06.390 align:middle line:84%
this is not something
that archaeologists

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:08.230 align:middle line:84%
or ancient alien
people are making up.

00:01:08.230 --> 00:01:10.290 align:middle line:84%
This is completely,
completely real.

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:13.690 align:middle line:84%
Now they say that there
are ways of making--

00:01:13.690 --> 00:01:17.290 align:middle line:84%
when you take infant babies
and the plates in your head

00:01:17.290 --> 00:01:20.500 align:middle line:84%
haven't fused yet,
you can compress them.

00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:25.330 align:middle line:84%
So it is possible to
deform infant's head

00:01:25.330 --> 00:01:29.200 align:middle line:84%
and that they'll
have this cone head.

00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:31.060 align:middle line:84%
And they know that
people did that.

00:01:31.060 --> 00:01:33.580 align:middle line:84%
This one is unusual,
too, this one,

00:01:33.580 --> 00:01:37.310 align:middle line:84%
because it doesn't
have the plates.

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:43.180 align:middle line:84%
There's no way you can see
the plates fusing on the head.

00:01:43.180 --> 00:01:44.540 align:middle line:90%
And it's quite strange.

00:01:44.540 --> 00:01:46.760 align:middle line:90%
Here we see the top of the head.

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:48.320 align:middle line:90%
So this is unusual.

00:01:48.320 --> 00:01:52.450 align:middle line:84%
I mean, this-- again,
doctors and stuff are saying,

00:01:52.450 --> 00:01:58.060 align:middle line:84%
well, yeah, we can't explain how
this guy was somehow deformed

00:01:58.060 --> 00:02:00.070 align:middle line:84%
and his head was
manipulated that.

00:02:00.070 --> 00:02:04.450 align:middle line:84%
So I mean, this may be
really an alien skull

00:02:04.450 --> 00:02:09.250 align:middle line:84%
and one who's naturally
has this elongated head

00:02:09.250 --> 00:02:12.800 align:middle line:84%
rather than it being
some kind of deformation.

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:15.650 align:middle line:90%


00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:16.640 align:middle line:90%
Here we go.

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:20.755 align:middle line:84%
Also, like a child mummy
that they found in Peru there

00:02:20.755 --> 00:02:23.690 align:middle line:84%
and him having the
elongated head.

00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:30.920 align:middle line:84%
So again, this is totally real
around Tiwanaku, these pyramids

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:32.400 align:middle line:90%
in Peru, other places, too.

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:33.300 align:middle line:90%
We'll see.

00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:35.200 align:middle line:84%
People had these
elongated heads.

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:36.560 align:middle line:90%
There's no question about it.

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:38.360 align:middle line:90%
This one's in Mexico.

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:39.210 align:middle line:10%
They found this.

00:02:39.210 --> 00:02:41.140 align:middle line:10%
This is found in
Northern Mexico.

00:02:41.140 --> 00:02:44.250 align:middle line:10%
He's got an elongated head.

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:49.650 align:middle line:84%
This is a Chinook Indian
from the Seattle area.

00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:52.920 align:middle line:84%
She has an elongated
head, but this may

00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:55.230 align:middle line:90%
have been artificially done.

00:02:55.230 --> 00:02:57.300 align:middle line:84%
I went to high school
in Missoula, Montana,

00:02:57.300 --> 00:03:01.210 align:middle line:84%
and just north of
Missoula is Flathead Lake.

00:03:01.210 --> 00:03:04.770 align:middle line:84%
It's the largest freshwater
lake west of the Mississippi.

00:03:04.770 --> 00:03:06.570 align:middle line:84%
And it's called
the Flathead Lake

00:03:06.570 --> 00:03:08.640 align:middle line:84%
because the Flathead
Indians live there.

00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:10.350 align:middle line:84%
And they're called
the Flathead Indians

00:03:10.350 --> 00:03:11.610 align:middle line:90%
because they had flatheads.

00:03:11.610 --> 00:03:14.672 align:middle line:84%
And they had also the
conical heads and stuff.

00:03:14.672 --> 00:03:17.130 align:middle line:84%
So it was happening right here
in the Western United States

00:03:17.130 --> 00:03:18.330 align:middle line:90%
even.

00:03:18.330 --> 00:03:22.720 align:middle line:84%
OK, here's a-- this is in
Lebanon and Israel, Philistine.

00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:24.510 align:middle line:90%
He's got an elongated head.

00:03:24.510 --> 00:03:28.950 align:middle line:84%
At Malta, they also knew these
guys had elongated heads.

00:03:28.950 --> 00:03:33.060 align:middle line:84%
This is a statue
of Meketaten, who

00:03:33.060 --> 00:03:36.510 align:middle line:84%
was one of the daughters
of Akhenaten and Nefertiti.

00:03:36.510 --> 00:03:39.700 align:middle line:90%
She's got an elongated head too.

00:03:39.700 --> 00:03:43.230 align:middle line:84%
So Akhenaten and Nefertiti,
a bunch of the Egyptians,

00:03:43.230 --> 00:03:46.730 align:middle line:84%
even Tutankhamun, they
had elongated heads.

00:03:46.730 --> 00:03:50.900 align:middle line:84%
This is one of the Ubaid
figurines from Northern Iraq.

00:03:50.900 --> 00:03:52.670 align:middle line:90%
This is also totally real.

00:03:52.670 --> 00:03:54.130 align:middle line:90%
He has the elongated head.

00:03:54.130 --> 00:03:58.040 align:middle line:84%
He's perhaps one of
the Anunnaki aliens.

00:03:58.040 --> 00:04:01.290 align:middle line:84%
He has what they call
the coffee bean eyes.

00:04:01.290 --> 00:04:03.050 align:middle line:90%
So he's a figure.

00:04:03.050 --> 00:04:04.540 align:middle line:90%
This is a clay figure.

00:04:04.540 --> 00:04:06.400 align:middle line:84%
But yeah, these
are one of-- these

00:04:06.400 --> 00:04:11.960 align:middle line:84%
are Sumerian gods coming down
from the sky, like the Anunnaki.

00:04:11.960 --> 00:04:13.350 align:middle line:90%
Here's more of them.

00:04:13.350 --> 00:04:17.959 align:middle line:84%
They have this strange coffee
bean, almost insect type eyes.

00:04:17.959 --> 00:04:22.120 align:middle line:84%
So yeah, we're perhaps looking
at statues of extraterrestrials

00:04:22.120 --> 00:04:24.160 align:middle line:90%
here.

00:04:24.160 --> 00:04:27.360 align:middle line:84%
Oh, this is a Sumerian
cylinder seal.

00:04:27.360 --> 00:04:33.270 align:middle line:84%
It's also got-- these guys are
up there in their winged disk.

00:04:33.270 --> 00:04:36.780 align:middle line:84%
So they've got their
flying saucer, literally.

00:04:36.780 --> 00:04:38.800 align:middle line:90%
And they're flying around.

00:04:38.800 --> 00:04:40.240 align:middle line:90%
That's what they did.

00:04:40.240 --> 00:04:42.660 align:middle line:84%
The Birdman, these
are Anunnaki here too.

00:04:42.660 --> 00:04:47.710 align:middle line:84%
The Anunnaki supposedly wore
these weird hats as well.

00:04:47.710 --> 00:04:49.860 align:middle line:10%
And here's the
winged figure here.

00:04:49.860 --> 00:04:56.100 align:middle line:10%
But this supposedly does
depict specifically Anunnaki.

00:04:56.100 --> 00:04:57.220 align:middle line:90%
But they have beards.

00:04:57.220 --> 00:05:01.230 align:middle line:84%
So they're very much like
humans, but different--

00:05:01.230 --> 00:05:05.040 align:middle line:84%
elongated heads, different
eyes, stuff like that.

00:05:05.040 --> 00:05:06.600 align:middle line:90%
It all gets pretty strange.

00:05:06.600 --> 00:05:10.330 align:middle line:84%
So we'll look at a
few UFO pictures here.

00:05:10.330 --> 00:05:11.480 align:middle line:90%
We always like UFOs.

00:05:11.480 --> 00:05:17.130 align:middle line:84%
This one's 1929, Ward, Colorado,
as flying saucers hovering

00:05:17.130 --> 00:05:18.120 align:middle line:90%
there.

00:05:18.120 --> 00:05:23.670 align:middle line:84%
New York city, March 20,
1950, huge, cigar-shaped craft

00:05:23.670 --> 00:05:27.540 align:middle line:84%
hovering over New
York City there.

00:05:27.540 --> 00:05:28.990 align:middle line:90%
This is what it looked like.

00:05:28.990 --> 00:05:31.200 align:middle line:90%
This photo was taken.

00:05:31.200 --> 00:05:33.420 align:middle line:84%
And these giant craft
would just hover

00:05:33.420 --> 00:05:36.090 align:middle line:84%
over New York City; sometimes
Washington, DC; sometimes

00:05:36.090 --> 00:05:37.620 align:middle line:90%
Los Angeles, major cities.

00:05:37.620 --> 00:05:38.910 align:middle line:90%
They wanted to be seen.

00:05:38.910 --> 00:05:40.830 align:middle line:90%
They wanted to be photographed.

00:05:40.830 --> 00:05:43.770 align:middle line:90%
Here, this one's in Utah, 1960.

00:05:43.770 --> 00:05:47.250 align:middle line:84%
Kind of looks like the
George Adamski craft, almost

00:05:47.250 --> 00:05:49.190 align:middle line:84%
sort of like a
primitive flying saucer.

00:05:49.190 --> 00:05:53.440 align:middle line:84%
This perhaps is one coming from
Area 51 or something like that.

00:05:53.440 --> 00:05:55.500 align:middle line:90%
I don't know.

00:05:55.500 --> 00:05:57.310 align:middle line:84%
And these are some
unusual photos.

00:05:57.310 --> 00:06:02.010 align:middle line:84%
Here, they are from
1971, the USS Trepang,

00:06:02.010 --> 00:06:04.860 align:middle line:84%
which was a submarine,
an American submarine.

00:06:04.860 --> 00:06:08.440 align:middle line:84%
And it was up near Iceland
in the North Atlantic.

00:06:08.440 --> 00:06:12.180 align:middle line:84%
These photographs were
published in a French magazine

00:06:12.180 --> 00:06:15.180 align:middle line:90%
in about 19--

00:06:15.180 --> 00:06:19.290 align:middle line:90%
or actually around 2005 or so.

00:06:19.290 --> 00:06:21.770 align:middle line:90%
But the photos were from 1971.

00:06:21.770 --> 00:06:22.570 align:middle line:90%
So we'll see it.

00:06:22.570 --> 00:06:25.350 align:middle line:84%
So what we're seeing
here is the beginning

00:06:25.350 --> 00:06:29.540 align:middle line:84%
of a giant, cigar-shaped craft
coming up out of the water.

00:06:29.540 --> 00:06:31.420 align:middle line:90%
So these things are submarines.

00:06:31.420 --> 00:06:33.470 align:middle line:90%
And they're airships.

00:06:33.470 --> 00:06:36.640 align:middle line:84%
So it's coming up
out of the water.

00:06:36.640 --> 00:06:38.920 align:middle line:90%
It's like waters coming off it.

00:06:38.920 --> 00:06:40.100 align:middle line:90%
It's steaming.

00:06:40.100 --> 00:06:44.120 align:middle line:84%
So it's kind of-- has this
steam and cloud around it.

00:06:44.120 --> 00:06:49.920 align:middle line:84%
It starts to then level off
and come straight up out

00:06:49.920 --> 00:06:50.720 align:middle line:90%
of the water.

00:06:50.720 --> 00:06:53.110 align:middle line:90%
Then it starts leveling off.

00:06:53.110 --> 00:06:57.700 align:middle line:84%
It's a gigantic,
cigar-shaped craft.

00:06:57.700 --> 00:07:01.630 align:middle line:84%
The lines there are
from the magazine.

00:07:01.630 --> 00:07:02.780 align:middle line:90%
This one, too.

00:07:02.780 --> 00:07:05.020 align:middle line:84%
This is in that line
in the middle that's

00:07:05.020 --> 00:07:07.970 align:middle line:84%
like the staple of
the French magazine.

00:07:07.970 --> 00:07:09.790 align:middle line:90%
So here it is coming--

00:07:09.790 --> 00:07:11.090 align:middle line:90%
it's leveling out.

00:07:11.090 --> 00:07:13.460 align:middle line:84%
It's got windows
and stuff on it.

00:07:13.460 --> 00:07:18.520 align:middle line:84%
And apparently, the sailors
on this USS American submarine

00:07:18.520 --> 00:07:23.300 align:middle line:84%
are taking these photos as they
watch this craft do all this.

00:07:23.300 --> 00:07:25.700 align:middle line:84%
And it may be doing
it for the submarine.

00:07:25.700 --> 00:07:26.500 align:middle line:90%
We don't know.

00:07:26.500 --> 00:07:28.450 align:middle line:90%
There, it levels out.

00:07:28.450 --> 00:07:32.920 align:middle line:90%
And it's a huge, giant airship.

00:07:32.920 --> 00:07:34.820 align:middle line:90%
And it's come out of the water.

00:07:34.820 --> 00:07:39.160 align:middle line:84%
And then it basically-- it
takes off and flies away.

00:07:39.160 --> 00:07:45.710 align:middle line:84%
Here's one last photo of the
giant, cigar-shaped object.

00:07:45.710 --> 00:07:50.110 align:middle line:84%
Then after that,
another object came out

00:07:50.110 --> 00:07:53.980 align:middle line:84%
of the water that was more like
a flying saucer type of craft,

00:07:53.980 --> 00:07:58.090 align:middle line:84%
a smaller one so that there
was more than just one craft

00:07:58.090 --> 00:07:59.030 align:middle line:90%
coming out.

00:07:59.030 --> 00:08:01.850 align:middle line:90%
And then it also flew away.

00:08:01.850 --> 00:08:06.100 align:middle line:84%
And so we have the big,
cigar-shaped mothership

00:08:06.100 --> 00:08:09.250 align:middle line:84%
and then this other
smaller flying

00:08:09.250 --> 00:08:11.500 align:middle line:90%
saucer type craft coming out.

00:08:11.500 --> 00:08:16.000 align:middle line:84%
Now this is also something that
most Americans never really

00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:17.710 align:middle line:90%
have seen before.

00:08:17.710 --> 00:08:21.580 align:middle line:84%
In 1978, Kaikoura,
New Zealand, there

00:08:21.580 --> 00:08:24.560 align:middle line:84%
was a cargo flight that
was almost every night,

00:08:24.560 --> 00:08:27.940 align:middle line:84%
it would fly from Auckland down
to Christchurch in the Southern

00:08:27.940 --> 00:08:31.210 align:middle line:84%
Island, and then it
would fly back at night.

00:08:31.210 --> 00:08:33.140 align:middle line:90%
And it had a crew on it.

00:08:33.140 --> 00:08:36.015 align:middle line:90%
It was a cargo plane.

00:08:36.015 --> 00:08:37.390 align:middle line:84%
And they were
doing this nightly.

00:08:37.390 --> 00:08:41.559 align:middle line:84%
And they found that
during December of 1978,

00:08:41.559 --> 00:08:45.140 align:middle line:84%
that they were being followed
constantly by a flying saucer.

00:08:45.140 --> 00:08:49.460 align:middle line:84%
And this flying saucer was
following them almost nightly.

00:08:49.460 --> 00:08:53.460 align:middle line:84%
And so they decided to put a
film crew on it to film it.

00:08:53.460 --> 00:08:55.150 align:middle line:90%
And this is what it filmed.

00:08:55.150 --> 00:08:56.830 align:middle line:90%
It filmed the craft.

00:08:56.830 --> 00:09:01.600 align:middle line:84%
This is all part of the
16-millimeter film or something.

00:09:01.600 --> 00:09:06.000 align:middle line:84%
But what happened in this last
frame or second last frame

00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:08.640 align:middle line:84%
over here is something
kind of amazing.

00:09:08.640 --> 00:09:10.590 align:middle line:90%
It's this one here.

00:09:10.590 --> 00:09:14.313 align:middle line:84%
The film is at 32
frames per second.

00:09:14.313 --> 00:09:16.851 align:middle line:90%


00:09:16.851 --> 00:09:20.310 align:middle line:84%
And in one of the
frames, the craft

00:09:20.310 --> 00:09:23.690 align:middle line:90%
made this figure eight move.

00:09:23.690 --> 00:09:26.990 align:middle line:84%
In a fraction of a
second, it did this,

00:09:26.990 --> 00:09:29.210 align:middle line:90%
and it came out on the film.

00:09:29.210 --> 00:09:30.690 align:middle line:90%
I mean, people were astonished.

00:09:30.690 --> 00:09:32.630 align:middle line:84%
And there was a book
that was published

00:09:32.630 --> 00:09:34.040 align:middle line:90%
in New Zealand about it.

00:09:34.040 --> 00:09:35.730 align:middle line:84%
And it had a color
photo section.

00:09:35.730 --> 00:09:37.190 align:middle line:90%
And this is what it's from.

00:09:37.190 --> 00:09:38.700 align:middle line:90%
So that was astonishing.

00:09:38.700 --> 00:09:41.150 align:middle line:84%
And it wanted to
be photographed.

00:09:41.150 --> 00:09:43.680 align:middle line:90%
It was doing this for them.

00:09:43.680 --> 00:09:46.650 align:middle line:84%
Hey, look at me, look
at what I can do.

00:09:46.650 --> 00:09:48.760 align:middle line:84%
Here we go, down
in South America.

00:09:48.760 --> 00:09:52.470 align:middle line:84%
South America is a hotbed of
UFO activity, let me tell you.

00:09:52.470 --> 00:09:55.180 align:middle line:84%
Everyone down in South
America believes in UFOs.

00:09:55.180 --> 00:09:59.910 align:middle line:84%
It's not a-- it's not even
something to question.

00:09:59.910 --> 00:10:04.040 align:middle line:84%
Because there's so many UFOs
that are on TV all the time.

00:10:04.040 --> 00:10:07.800 align:middle line:84%
So here's a classic flying
saucer during the day,

00:10:07.800 --> 00:10:09.190 align:middle line:90%
flying around.

00:10:09.190 --> 00:10:10.180 align:middle line:10%
Here we go.

00:10:10.180 --> 00:10:13.230 align:middle line:10%
Now this was one near
Wright-Patterson Air Force base

00:10:13.230 --> 00:10:16.030 align:middle line:10%
in Dayton, Ohio, 2016.

00:10:16.030 --> 00:10:18.390 align:middle line:10%
And here people
looked up in the sky.

00:10:18.390 --> 00:10:22.890 align:middle line:84%
And they saw this thing just
hovering, flying in the--

00:10:22.890 --> 00:10:26.770 align:middle line:84%
floating in the sky, just
there, this arrowhead object.

00:10:26.770 --> 00:10:28.980 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it's not even
a-- it's not a flying

00:10:28.980 --> 00:10:31.030 align:middle line:90%
saucer or circular object.

00:10:31.030 --> 00:10:34.300 align:middle line:84%
It's just something
weird hovering over that.

00:10:34.300 --> 00:10:37.410 align:middle line:84%
And this is an Air Force-- this
is an area around an Air Force

00:10:37.410 --> 00:10:38.250 align:middle line:90%
base.

00:10:38.250 --> 00:10:40.680 align:middle line:90%
So here it is again.

00:10:40.680 --> 00:10:41.880 align:middle line:90%
What was this thing?

00:10:41.880 --> 00:10:45.690 align:middle line:84%
And it's clearly got some
antigravity levitation.

00:10:45.690 --> 00:10:46.490 align:middle line:90%
It's doing it.

00:10:46.490 --> 00:10:48.290 align:middle line:84%
I mean, we don't know
what's going on here.

00:10:48.290 --> 00:10:50.470 align:middle line:84%
There's an alien
craft or something

00:10:50.470 --> 00:10:53.890 align:middle line:90%
coming from the Air Force base.

00:10:53.890 --> 00:10:58.280 align:middle line:84%
So we have the Baltic
Sea anomaly in 2011.

00:10:58.280 --> 00:11:01.780 align:middle line:84%
And that was a thing
that was on the bottom

00:11:01.780 --> 00:11:05.930 align:middle line:84%
of the Baltic Sea, which is up
Sweden and Finland, that area.

00:11:05.930 --> 00:11:08.860 align:middle line:84%
And they sent submarines
and stuff out there

00:11:08.860 --> 00:11:10.700 align:middle line:90%
to see what it was.

00:11:10.700 --> 00:11:14.090 align:middle line:84%
And it actually--
here's the object.

00:11:14.090 --> 00:11:17.420 align:middle line:84%
Actually, it looks like the
Millennium Falcon from "Star

00:11:17.420 --> 00:11:18.220 align:middle line:90%
Wars."

00:11:18.220 --> 00:11:19.270 align:middle line:90%
So yeah.

00:11:19.270 --> 00:11:21.062 align:middle line:84%
They were like, well,
they didn't know what

00:11:21.062 --> 00:11:22.280 align:middle line:90%
this thing was sitting there.

00:11:22.280 --> 00:11:26.410 align:middle line:84%
And it may have actually
eventually just left

00:11:26.410 --> 00:11:27.550 align:middle line:90%
and went somewhere else.

00:11:27.550 --> 00:11:29.380 align:middle line:90%
We don't know.

00:11:29.380 --> 00:11:32.920 align:middle line:84%
So Dr. Kirkpatrick,
this is the head of--

00:11:32.920 --> 00:11:34.520 align:middle line:90%
he's just retiring.

00:11:34.520 --> 00:11:40.030 align:middle line:84%
He was the head of the
official Pentagon, the UFO Task

00:11:40.030 --> 00:11:41.990 align:middle line:90%
Force, UAP Task Force.

00:11:41.990 --> 00:11:46.400 align:middle line:84%
And he's testifying to Congress
about UFOs and whatnot.

00:11:46.400 --> 00:11:50.080 align:middle line:84%
And so they're saying now,
finally, after all these years,

00:11:50.080 --> 00:11:52.640 align:middle line:84%
oh, yeah, there's UFOs
out there, we know.

00:11:52.640 --> 00:11:56.770 align:middle line:84%
And he released the--
only, they don't really

00:11:56.770 --> 00:11:58.480 align:middle line:90%
give you much information.

00:11:58.480 --> 00:12:01.780 align:middle line:84%
There's that Tic Tac
video and stuff like that.

00:12:01.780 --> 00:12:04.790 align:middle line:84%
And he released this photo,
which was also in Iraq.

00:12:04.790 --> 00:12:06.200 align:middle line:90%
It was taken by a drone.

00:12:06.200 --> 00:12:10.810 align:middle line:84%
But down here is this
object, round object

00:12:10.810 --> 00:12:14.210 align:middle line:84%
that was zipping by
the camera and stuff.

00:12:14.210 --> 00:12:16.870 align:middle line:84%
And yeah, he actually
showed this photo

00:12:16.870 --> 00:12:20.140 align:middle line:84%
to all these senators and stuff
like that and saying, yeah,

00:12:20.140 --> 00:12:21.590 align:middle line:90%
this is a UFO.

00:12:21.590 --> 00:12:23.055 align:middle line:90%
We don't know what it is.

00:12:23.055 --> 00:12:25.570 align:middle line:90%


00:12:25.570 --> 00:12:28.420 align:middle line:84%
Admiral Roscoe Hillenkoetter,
he was the first director

00:12:28.420 --> 00:12:29.270 align:middle line:90%
of the CIA.

00:12:29.270 --> 00:12:33.940 align:middle line:84%
He was also the top guy on
MJ12, if you've heard of that.

00:12:33.940 --> 00:12:38.860 align:middle line:84%
And he told "The New York Times"
on February 27, 1960-- he said,

00:12:38.860 --> 00:12:40.810 align:middle line:84%
"through official
secrecy and ridicule,

00:12:40.810 --> 00:12:44.830 align:middle line:84%
many citizens are led to believe
the unknown flying objects are

00:12:44.830 --> 00:12:45.950 align:middle line:90%
nonsense."

00:12:45.950 --> 00:12:49.420 align:middle line:84%
I mean, this guy was--
he was the top admiral.

00:12:49.420 --> 00:12:54.490 align:middle line:84%
And really before the CIA and
MJ12, it was Naval intelligence.

00:12:54.490 --> 00:13:00.860 align:middle line:84%
That was where all the spooks
and Navy guys and whatnot.

00:13:00.860 --> 00:13:03.850 align:middle line:84%
And he was the main
guy, Hillenkoetter.

00:13:03.850 --> 00:13:06.790 align:middle line:84%
So there he is telling
"The New York Times," yeah,

00:13:06.790 --> 00:13:08.140 align:middle line:90%
UFOs are real.

00:13:08.140 --> 00:13:10.780 align:middle line:84%
But officially, the Air
Force and all these guys

00:13:10.780 --> 00:13:13.930 align:middle line:84%
are saying, no, no
swamp gas, there's

00:13:13.930 --> 00:13:16.600 align:middle line:84%
nothing to see
here kind of thing.

00:13:16.600 --> 00:13:22.540 align:middle line:84%
All right, so now let's look
at Nikola Tesla, greatest

00:13:22.540 --> 00:13:23.750 align:middle line:90%
inventor who ever lived.

00:13:23.750 --> 00:13:26.175 align:middle line:90%
I got my Tesla T-shirt on.

00:13:26.175 --> 00:13:26.975 align:middle line:90%
And--

00:13:26.975 --> 00:13:28.550 align:middle line:90%
[APPLAUSE]

00:13:28.550 --> 00:13:30.810 align:middle line:84%
And I'm hoping you guys
all know who Tesla is.

00:13:30.810 --> 00:13:31.700 align:middle line:90%
It's so important.

00:13:31.700 --> 00:13:34.580 align:middle line:84%
He's a suppressed
person, I believe.

00:13:34.580 --> 00:13:36.690 align:middle line:84%
His inventions and
things like that--

00:13:36.690 --> 00:13:42.140 align:middle line:84%
he was an immigrant
from Serbia and Croatia.

00:13:42.140 --> 00:13:45.960 align:middle line:84%
He would envision just
inventions in the sky

00:13:45.960 --> 00:13:48.170 align:middle line:90%
and in his mind.

00:13:48.170 --> 00:13:50.310 align:middle line:84%
He was an amazing,
amazing person.

00:13:50.310 --> 00:13:52.560 align:middle line:90%
He first went to London.

00:13:52.560 --> 00:13:54.300 align:middle line:84%
And then he came to
the United States.

00:13:54.300 --> 00:13:56.880 align:middle line:84%
He worked briefly for
Edison and whatnot.

00:13:56.880 --> 00:14:01.070 align:middle line:84%
But then he invented what
we call AC power today,

00:14:01.070 --> 00:14:03.410 align:middle line:90%
three-phase current.

00:14:03.410 --> 00:14:06.320 align:middle line:84%
His inventions are what's
lighting this whole hotel

00:14:06.320 --> 00:14:08.330 align:middle line:90%
and the whole world today.

00:14:08.330 --> 00:14:11.490 align:middle line:84%
AC power, and he was
the inventor of it.

00:14:11.490 --> 00:14:17.090 align:middle line:84%
I mean, this guy is the
greatest genius who ever lived.

00:14:17.090 --> 00:14:20.550 align:middle line:90%
So here he is.

00:14:20.550 --> 00:14:25.820 align:middle line:84%
Here's Mark Twain in Tesla's
laboratory, late 1800s.

00:14:25.820 --> 00:14:29.120 align:middle line:10%
Here's Tesla himself doing
a wireless transmission

00:14:29.120 --> 00:14:30.990 align:middle line:10%
demo in 1899.

00:14:30.990 --> 00:14:37.910 align:middle line:10%
So after Tesla had invented
AC power and whatnot,

00:14:37.910 --> 00:14:41.300 align:middle line:10%
he then began this thing
about this wireless power.

00:14:41.300 --> 00:14:44.250 align:middle line:10%
And he was going to
make these towers.

00:14:44.250 --> 00:14:50.330 align:middle line:10%
His laboratory almost got
completely destroyed in a fire.

00:14:50.330 --> 00:14:52.590 align:middle line:10%
We don't know if that
was purposely set or not.

00:14:52.590 --> 00:14:55.220 align:middle line:10%
People trying to stop him.

00:14:55.220 --> 00:14:59.550 align:middle line:10%
One of his students
was Guglielmo Marconi.

00:14:59.550 --> 00:15:02.751 align:middle line:10%
Marconi was a genius, too.

00:15:02.751 --> 00:15:05.370 align:middle line:84%
He's credited as
inventor of the radio.

00:15:05.370 --> 00:15:09.450 align:middle line:84%
He, like Tesla, did all
kinds of amazing things.

00:15:09.450 --> 00:15:12.350 align:middle line:84%
He lived on a yacht
called The Electra.

00:15:12.350 --> 00:15:17.340 align:middle line:84%
And he actually lit lights
in Australia and stuff

00:15:17.340 --> 00:15:20.310 align:middle line:84%
from his boat in
the Mediterranean.

00:15:20.310 --> 00:15:22.980 align:middle line:84%
He died just before
World War II,

00:15:22.980 --> 00:15:26.580 align:middle line:84%
supposedly, although there are
stories that he and his group

00:15:26.580 --> 00:15:29.670 align:middle line:84%
went down to South
America to a secret city.

00:15:29.670 --> 00:15:34.200 align:middle line:10%
Albert Einstein--
so Einstein had what

00:15:34.200 --> 00:15:35.830 align:middle line:10%
we called the unified field.

00:15:35.830 --> 00:15:41.220 align:middle line:10%
A unified field is gravity,
magnetism, and electricity

00:15:41.220 --> 00:15:43.060 align:middle line:10%
and what they call
the nuclear force.

00:15:43.060 --> 00:15:45.630 align:middle line:84%
So what Einstein said was
that, all of these things

00:15:45.630 --> 00:15:48.670 align:middle line:90%
manifest from the unified field.

00:15:48.670 --> 00:15:51.690 align:middle line:84%
And so just with
the unified field,

00:15:51.690 --> 00:15:55.590 align:middle line:84%
you can have an equation
for electromagnetism,

00:15:55.590 --> 00:15:58.680 align:middle line:84%
but you can also have an
equation for electro gravity

00:15:58.680 --> 00:16:01.720 align:middle line:84%
and an equation for
magneto gravity.

00:16:01.720 --> 00:16:05.790 align:middle line:84%
So once you understand
and grasp and are

00:16:05.790 --> 00:16:07.860 align:middle line:84%
able to utilize
the unified field,

00:16:07.860 --> 00:16:10.030 align:middle line:90%
then you can manipulate gravity.

00:16:10.030 --> 00:16:13.020 align:middle line:84%
And there you have
antigravity, gravity, control,

00:16:13.020 --> 00:16:14.560 align:middle line:90%
all that kind of stuff.

00:16:14.560 --> 00:16:20.460 align:middle line:84%
So with gravity waves, storage
fields, mercury, mercury gyros--

00:16:20.460 --> 00:16:25.124 align:middle line:90%
gyros are antigravity.

00:16:25.124 --> 00:16:31.200 align:middle line:84%
You have swirling toroid
artificial tornadoes,

00:16:31.200 --> 00:16:32.190 align:middle line:90%
shall we say.

00:16:32.190 --> 00:16:33.550 align:middle line:90%
When you use mercury--

00:16:33.550 --> 00:16:35.650 align:middle line:90%
mercury is a metal.

00:16:35.650 --> 00:16:36.630 align:middle line:90%
It's an element.

00:16:36.630 --> 00:16:37.710 align:middle line:90%
It's a liquid.

00:16:37.710 --> 00:16:39.250 align:middle line:90%
It's a conductor.

00:16:39.250 --> 00:16:43.110 align:middle line:84%
And the ancient Vimana
texts talk about mercury

00:16:43.110 --> 00:16:49.240 align:middle line:84%
as being part of the craft and
the propulsion of the craft.

00:16:49.240 --> 00:16:57.320 align:middle line:84%
And in fact, the main town
at Area 51, just northwest

00:16:57.320 --> 00:17:00.120 align:middle line:90%
of Las Vegas is a town.

00:17:00.120 --> 00:17:02.800 align:middle line:90%
It's called Mercury--

00:17:02.800 --> 00:17:04.180 align:middle line:90%
Mercury, Nevada.

00:17:04.180 --> 00:17:06.430 align:middle line:84%
And there's a sign on the
interstate, whatever says

00:17:06.430 --> 00:17:10.000 align:middle line:90%
Mercury, you can't go there.

00:17:10.000 --> 00:17:13.300 align:middle line:84%
You need a military security
clearance and stuff.

00:17:13.300 --> 00:17:17.119 align:middle line:84%
But that's what they named their
town in Area 51 was Mercury.

00:17:17.119 --> 00:17:19.310 align:middle line:84%
So Tesla was known
also for death rays.

00:17:19.310 --> 00:17:21.760 align:middle line:84%
Back in the '30s, everyone
talked about death rays,

00:17:21.760 --> 00:17:22.940 align:middle line:90%
ray guns.

00:17:22.940 --> 00:17:27.069 align:middle line:84%
Flash Gordon and Buck Rogers
were zooming across the screen.

00:17:27.069 --> 00:17:31.180 align:middle line:84%
And they're buzzing electric
spaceships, antigravity,

00:17:31.180 --> 00:17:33.700 align:middle line:90%
all that kind of stuff.

00:17:33.700 --> 00:17:36.670 align:middle line:10%
The whole idea of these
scalar waves or beams

00:17:36.670 --> 00:17:40.960 align:middle line:10%
come together in a death ray
and where the beams converge,

00:17:40.960 --> 00:17:43.360 align:middle line:10%
this becomes a energy bottle.

00:17:43.360 --> 00:17:45.410 align:middle line:90%
And it destroys everything.

00:17:45.410 --> 00:17:47.330 align:middle line:84%
So these are the
death rays of Tesla.

00:17:47.330 --> 00:17:50.470 align:middle line:90%
And now this is all 1930 stuff.

00:17:50.470 --> 00:17:52.950 align:middle line:90%
It's all before World War II.

00:17:52.950 --> 00:17:56.300 align:middle line:10%
So yeah, his death ray
is a mercury plasma jet.

00:17:56.300 --> 00:17:57.710 align:middle line:10%
Mercury is coming out of this.

00:17:57.710 --> 00:18:00.970 align:middle line:10%
And in fact, it's exactly the
same thing that you see on "Star

00:18:00.970 --> 00:18:05.010 align:middle line:10%
Wars," where they're shooting--
the Star Troopers and stuff,

00:18:05.010 --> 00:18:08.640 align:middle line:10%
they're firing these
light beam things.

00:18:08.640 --> 00:18:11.300 align:middle line:84%
And what they are,
are these-- they're

00:18:11.300 --> 00:18:15.120 align:middle line:84%
like mercury bullets
that are super heated.

00:18:15.120 --> 00:18:18.000 align:middle line:84%
And you need to have a
reservoir of mercury.

00:18:18.000 --> 00:18:20.090 align:middle line:84%
But each time you
fire this thing,

00:18:20.090 --> 00:18:23.600 align:middle line:84%
it shoots this super,
duper, hot, thousands

00:18:23.600 --> 00:18:27.720 align:middle line:84%
of degrees mercury
pellet that's liquid.

00:18:27.720 --> 00:18:30.380 align:middle line:84%
And it'll just go straight
through you or straight

00:18:30.380 --> 00:18:31.970 align:middle line:84%
through metal and
stuff like that.

00:18:31.970 --> 00:18:34.680 align:middle line:90%
Because it's so super hot.

00:18:34.680 --> 00:18:39.480 align:middle line:84%
And it's really analogous to
what you see on "Star Wars."

00:18:39.480 --> 00:18:43.200 align:middle line:84%
So this was one of
Tesla's inventions.

00:18:43.200 --> 00:18:45.510 align:middle line:90%
Tesla died during World War II.

00:18:45.510 --> 00:18:49.145 align:middle line:90%
He died in 1943.

00:18:49.145 --> 00:18:53.570 align:middle line:10%
But prior to that, he started
developing these towers,

00:18:53.570 --> 00:18:56.330 align:middle line:10%
the wireless
transmission towers.

00:18:56.330 --> 00:18:57.720 align:middle line:10%
Here you see it here.

00:18:57.720 --> 00:19:01.310 align:middle line:84%
And he did experiments
at Colorado Springs

00:19:01.310 --> 00:19:05.280 align:middle line:84%
because of the dry air
there and the high altitude.

00:19:05.280 --> 00:19:08.630 align:middle line:84%
And then he went
back to New York.

00:19:08.630 --> 00:19:12.230 align:middle line:84%
And he began building
this tower on Long Island.

00:19:12.230 --> 00:19:14.220 align:middle line:90%
Here's his patent for the tower.

00:19:14.220 --> 00:19:16.220 align:middle line:10%
Now what the towers
were going to do then

00:19:16.220 --> 00:19:20.490 align:middle line:10%
was broadcast
electricity into the air.

00:19:20.490 --> 00:19:22.310 align:middle line:84%
And then you would
pick things up

00:19:22.310 --> 00:19:25.980 align:middle line:84%
like you wouldn't need
to plug a lamp in.

00:19:25.980 --> 00:19:29.390 align:middle line:84%
You could just put a lamp
on a table and turn it on.

00:19:29.390 --> 00:19:32.430 align:middle line:84%
And it didn't need a outlet
or anything like this.

00:19:32.430 --> 00:19:37.130 align:middle line:84%
This is back-- and this is
1930 that he's doing that.

00:19:37.130 --> 00:19:40.950 align:middle line:84%
And here's his
towers, the airships.

00:19:40.950 --> 00:19:43.820 align:middle line:10%
Tesla had these antigravity
airships and stuff

00:19:43.820 --> 00:19:45.930 align:middle line:10%
like that that he had created.

00:19:45.930 --> 00:19:48.920 align:middle line:10%
Here's his tower in action.

00:19:48.920 --> 00:19:50.930 align:middle line:10%
Back then, there
were these magazines,

00:19:50.930 --> 00:19:53.400 align:middle line:10%
electrical experimenter,
and stuff like that.

00:19:53.400 --> 00:19:59.610 align:middle line:10%
And they would just draw
these conceptual artists.

00:19:59.610 --> 00:20:01.650 align:middle line:90%
But yeah, it's a tower there.

00:20:01.650 --> 00:20:05.120 align:middle line:84%
It's just broadcasting
power like a radio station,

00:20:05.120 --> 00:20:06.870 align:middle line:90%
like a television station.

00:20:06.870 --> 00:20:08.840 align:middle line:90%
And these airships are there.

00:20:08.840 --> 00:20:10.880 align:middle line:84%
They're picking up--
they're antigravity.

00:20:10.880 --> 00:20:12.750 align:middle line:90%
They're picking up the power.

00:20:12.750 --> 00:20:16.740 align:middle line:84%
They have powerful searchlights
on them that are coming down,

00:20:16.740 --> 00:20:19.770 align:middle line:84%
very similar to
many UFO stories.

00:20:19.770 --> 00:20:23.390 align:middle line:90%
Here it is, the tower again.

00:20:23.390 --> 00:20:25.890 align:middle line:84%
They're having battles
and stuff with planes.

00:20:25.890 --> 00:20:27.300 align:middle line:90%
These airships are up there.

00:20:27.300 --> 00:20:29.570 align:middle line:84%
They're very similar to
the cigar-shaped airships

00:20:29.570 --> 00:20:30.630 align:middle line:90%
we're talking about.

00:20:30.630 --> 00:20:31.980 align:middle line:90%
They're antigravity.

00:20:31.980 --> 00:20:33.218 align:middle line:90%
They're electric.

00:20:33.218 --> 00:20:34.260 align:middle line:90%
I mean, that's the thing.

00:20:34.260 --> 00:20:36.950 align:middle line:90%
These things are electric.

00:20:36.950 --> 00:20:39.570 align:middle line:84%
Virtually, all UFOs,
they're electric craft.

00:20:39.570 --> 00:20:40.710 align:middle line:90%
They're not rockets.

00:20:40.710 --> 00:20:42.840 align:middle line:90%
They're not jets.

00:20:42.840 --> 00:20:44.570 align:middle line:90%
They're electric.

00:20:44.570 --> 00:20:48.680 align:middle line:84%
You turn them on, and
an electrical field

00:20:48.680 --> 00:20:49.820 align:middle line:90%
comes around them.

00:20:49.820 --> 00:20:52.520 align:middle line:84%
And then you start
flying around.

00:20:52.520 --> 00:20:54.330 align:middle line:90%
Now how about this?

00:20:54.330 --> 00:20:57.440 align:middle line:84%
There was a group that
started in Milwaukee.

00:20:57.440 --> 00:21:00.020 align:middle line:84%
And then they moved
to California.

00:21:00.020 --> 00:21:03.322 align:middle line:84%
They still kind of exist
today down near San Diego.

00:21:03.322 --> 00:21:05.030 align:middle line:84%
They were called the
Lemurian Fellowship.

00:21:05.030 --> 00:21:08.270 align:middle line:10%
And they maintained
that in ancient Atlantis

00:21:08.270 --> 00:21:13.800 align:middle line:10%
were these giant crystal towers
that they called the Maxt Tower.

00:21:13.800 --> 00:21:17.120 align:middle line:84%
And these towers were
broadcasting electricity

00:21:17.120 --> 00:21:19.100 align:middle line:90%
like Tesla's towers.

00:21:19.100 --> 00:21:23.430 align:middle line:84%
And they broadcast electricity
throughout the world.

00:21:23.430 --> 00:21:26.780 align:middle line:84%
These Atlantean airships,
they called them Valexes.

00:21:26.780 --> 00:21:28.310 align:middle line:90%
It'd be like a Vimana.

00:21:28.310 --> 00:21:31.140 align:middle line:84%
And they would pick
up power and all that.

00:21:31.140 --> 00:21:33.740 align:middle line:84%
There's a book called "A
Dweller on Two Planets"

00:21:33.740 --> 00:21:35.700 align:middle line:84%
that was about Mount
Shasta and stuff.

00:21:35.700 --> 00:21:37.470 align:middle line:84%
It also had all
this stuff in it.

00:21:37.470 --> 00:21:40.070 align:middle line:84%
So there are crystal
towers like that.

00:21:40.070 --> 00:21:43.250 align:middle line:90%
And they're called obelisks.

00:21:43.250 --> 00:21:46.056 align:middle line:90%
An obelisk is a monolith.

00:21:46.056 --> 00:21:47.450 align:middle line:90%
They're granite.

00:21:47.450 --> 00:21:51.030 align:middle line:84%
Granite is infused
with quartz crystals.

00:21:51.030 --> 00:21:55.370 align:middle line:84%
So these are basically-- a
granite obelisk is essentially

00:21:55.370 --> 00:21:58.740 align:middle line:90%
a giant quartz crystal tower.

00:21:58.740 --> 00:22:00.540 align:middle line:90%
And it has to be-- it's solid.

00:22:00.540 --> 00:22:03.650 align:middle line:84%
It's not in pieces
and stuff like that.

00:22:03.650 --> 00:22:10.190 align:middle line:84%
So there are-- the main place we
see obelisks today are in Egypt.

00:22:10.190 --> 00:22:15.110 align:middle line:10%
And here, again, this is an old
photo of the unfinished obelisk

00:22:15.110 --> 00:22:16.140 align:middle line:10%
that we saw earlier.

00:22:16.140 --> 00:22:18.340 align:middle line:10%
You can see how just
gigantically huge it was.

00:22:18.340 --> 00:22:19.140 align:middle line:10%
It was buried.

00:22:19.140 --> 00:22:21.090 align:middle line:10%
They decided they
couldn't use it.

00:22:21.090 --> 00:22:22.530 align:middle line:10%
Here it is again.

00:22:22.530 --> 00:22:25.460 align:middle line:10%
So because it had that
crack underneath it,

00:22:25.460 --> 00:22:28.560 align:middle line:10%
they abandoned it, because it
wasn't going to be perfect.

00:22:28.560 --> 00:22:32.220 align:middle line:10%
But just bashing this
out or cutting it--

00:22:32.220 --> 00:22:35.010 align:middle line:10%
here's Christopher Dunnigan
inside the grooves.

00:22:35.010 --> 00:22:37.820 align:middle line:10%
I mean, these are
power tools and hammers

00:22:37.820 --> 00:22:41.060 align:middle line:10%
that are making these
things and scraping it out.

00:22:41.060 --> 00:22:45.630 align:middle line:84%
You just can't do this
with a rock hammer

00:22:45.630 --> 00:22:47.490 align:middle line:90%
and stuff in your hand.

00:22:47.490 --> 00:22:49.620 align:middle line:84%
Here's the Washington
Monument being

00:22:49.620 --> 00:22:51.610 align:middle line:90%
hit by lightning and stuff.

00:22:51.610 --> 00:22:54.060 align:middle line:10%
The Washington Monument
is a faux obelisk.

00:22:54.060 --> 00:22:55.560 align:middle line:84%
It's not a real
obelisk because it's

00:22:55.560 --> 00:22:58.420 align:middle line:84%
built out of blocks of
stone and stuff like that.

00:22:58.420 --> 00:22:59.860 align:middle line:90%
You can walk up inside it.

00:22:59.860 --> 00:23:03.790 align:middle line:84%
Real obelisks are
solid granite stone.

00:23:03.790 --> 00:23:05.940 align:middle line:84%
But the obelisk-- the
Washington Monument

00:23:05.940 --> 00:23:09.760 align:middle line:90%
is the symbol of American power.

00:23:09.760 --> 00:23:12.460 align:middle line:90%
And it's an obelisk.

00:23:12.460 --> 00:23:15.720 align:middle line:90%
That's what they put out there.

00:23:15.720 --> 00:23:17.610 align:middle line:84%
Archaeologists and
Egyptologists do not

00:23:17.610 --> 00:23:18.970 align:middle line:90%
know what obelisks were for.

00:23:18.970 --> 00:23:24.870 align:middle line:84%
They maintain that obelisks
symbolized a ray of the sun.

00:23:24.870 --> 00:23:29.010 align:middle line:84%
That's what they're saying,
these 500-ton towers.

00:23:29.010 --> 00:23:32.100 align:middle line:84%
The largest obelisk
that was ever erected

00:23:32.100 --> 00:23:35.070 align:middle line:90%
was in Aksum in Ethiopia.

00:23:35.070 --> 00:23:36.570 align:middle line:90%
And these are some of them.

00:23:36.570 --> 00:23:38.910 align:middle line:90%
That obelisk fell down.

00:23:38.910 --> 00:23:41.710 align:middle line:84%
And it was the largest
obelisk ever erected.

00:23:41.710 --> 00:23:43.330 align:middle line:90%
It weighed about 1,000 tons.

00:23:43.330 --> 00:23:48.450 align:middle line:84%
The quarry there in Aksum,
it's about 10 miles away

00:23:48.450 --> 00:23:51.510 align:middle line:90%
to the west of the Aksum site.

00:23:51.510 --> 00:23:54.990 align:middle line:84%
This obelisk came
crashing down and broke

00:23:54.990 --> 00:23:57.010 align:middle line:90%
into a number of pieces.

00:23:57.010 --> 00:24:00.790 align:middle line:84%
Even pieces of this obelisk
are gigantically huge.

00:24:00.790 --> 00:24:02.170 align:middle line:90%
It's really something.

00:24:02.170 --> 00:24:06.930 align:middle line:84%
And it fell down onto this
other giant thing, structure

00:24:06.930 --> 00:24:08.520 align:middle line:90%
and broke it.

00:24:08.520 --> 00:24:10.900 align:middle line:84%
It also weighed
hundreds of tons.

00:24:10.900 --> 00:24:14.100 align:middle line:84%
And the people there,
the priests in Aksum,

00:24:14.100 --> 00:24:16.590 align:middle line:84%
they maintain there was some
antigravity machine in there

00:24:16.590 --> 00:24:21.360 align:middle line:84%
that lifted the obelisks
up and erected them,

00:24:21.360 --> 00:24:23.950 align:middle line:84%
because they would
need that antigravity.

00:24:23.950 --> 00:24:28.440 align:middle line:84%
So here in Aksum, too, we
see the Keystone cuts, again.

00:24:28.440 --> 00:24:30.370 align:middle line:84%
Here's the Keystone
cut in Aksum.

00:24:30.370 --> 00:24:35.460 align:middle line:84%
This is showing that the
same people in South America

00:24:35.460 --> 00:24:38.740 align:middle line:84%
and in Vietnam and whatnot,
they're building these things.

00:24:38.740 --> 00:24:39.810 align:middle line:90%
Here's one of those.

00:24:39.810 --> 00:24:44.270 align:middle line:84%
We were looking at those
megalithic, monolithic doors,

00:24:44.270 --> 00:24:48.200 align:middle line:84%
a door carved into a
solid piece of granite.

00:24:48.200 --> 00:24:51.170 align:middle line:84%
There's a church there
at Aksum that they

00:24:51.170 --> 00:24:53.930 align:middle line:84%
say the Ark of the Covenant
is in this church--

00:24:53.930 --> 00:24:55.710 align:middle line:90%
in this church right here.

00:24:55.710 --> 00:24:59.150 align:middle line:84%
And it's called the
Church of Saint Mary.

00:24:59.150 --> 00:25:00.360 align:middle line:90%
You can't go into it.

00:25:00.360 --> 00:25:04.050 align:middle line:84%
Only there's one priest who's
allowed in there at a time.

00:25:04.050 --> 00:25:05.370 align:middle line:90%
He's the guardian of it.

00:25:05.370 --> 00:25:07.680 align:middle line:84%
He's the only one
who can go in there.

00:25:07.680 --> 00:25:11.570 align:middle line:84%
And then before he dies,
he picks a successor priest

00:25:11.570 --> 00:25:13.590 align:middle line:90%
to take his place.

00:25:13.590 --> 00:25:18.200 align:middle line:84%
Even the president or king of
Ethiopia cannot go into this

00:25:18.200 --> 00:25:19.100 align:middle line:90%
building.

00:25:19.100 --> 00:25:23.000 align:middle line:84%
And Ethiopians, they believe
that the Ark of the Covenant

00:25:23.000 --> 00:25:24.360 align:middle line:90%
is in that church.

00:25:24.360 --> 00:25:26.090 align:middle line:90%
That's what they believe.

00:25:26.090 --> 00:25:29.400 align:middle line:84%
So there are other
obelisks, too, in England.

00:25:29.400 --> 00:25:31.380 align:middle line:84%
These are called
the Devil's Arrows.

00:25:31.380 --> 00:25:32.970 align:middle line:90%
They're in Yorkshire.

00:25:32.970 --> 00:25:34.710 align:middle line:90%
They're out there by a highway.

00:25:34.710 --> 00:25:36.750 align:middle line:84%
There's about three
or four of them.

00:25:36.750 --> 00:25:37.860 align:middle line:90%
They're kind of broken.

00:25:37.860 --> 00:25:42.440 align:middle line:84%
There's another obelisk in
England near Scarborough

00:25:42.440 --> 00:25:44.550 align:middle line:90%
on the-- also East Coast.

00:25:44.550 --> 00:25:46.180 align:middle line:84%
It's called the
Rudston Monolith.

00:25:46.180 --> 00:25:49.770 align:middle line:84%
In fact, they built a church
there because of this obelisk

00:25:49.770 --> 00:25:50.590 align:middle line:90%
was there.

00:25:50.590 --> 00:25:55.230 align:middle line:10%
So yeah, let's go to the
moon and all this weird stuff

00:25:55.230 --> 00:25:56.880 align:middle line:10%
on the moon.

00:25:56.880 --> 00:25:59.220 align:middle line:84%
And this is a photo
that was taken

00:25:59.220 --> 00:26:03.882 align:middle line:84%
early on by one
of the early NASA

00:26:03.882 --> 00:26:05.090 align:middle line:90%
things going around the moon.

00:26:05.090 --> 00:26:10.670 align:middle line:84%
And then an engineer who worked
for Boeing in Seattle, his name

00:26:10.670 --> 00:26:13.920 align:middle line:84%
was Blair, he then could
see these obelisks.

00:26:13.920 --> 00:26:15.300 align:middle line:90%
And it's hard to see on this.

00:26:15.300 --> 00:26:18.030 align:middle line:84%
It's the shadows
that they're showing.

00:26:18.030 --> 00:26:20.180 align:middle line:90%
All right, here's the Russians.

00:26:20.180 --> 00:26:22.130 align:middle line:84%
They call them
the Blair cuspids.

00:26:22.130 --> 00:26:25.410 align:middle line:84%
Here, the next slide will
show you what it looks like.

00:26:25.410 --> 00:26:28.170 align:middle line:84%
So these are these obelisks
that are on the moon.

00:26:28.170 --> 00:26:31.160 align:middle line:84%
They're called
the Blair cuspids.

00:26:31.160 --> 00:26:34.790 align:middle line:84%
And I wrote my
book about obelisks

00:26:34.790 --> 00:26:35.940 align:middle line:90%
and the powers of tower.

00:26:35.940 --> 00:26:39.980 align:middle line:90%
This photo is used for that.

00:26:39.980 --> 00:26:42.630 align:middle line:84%
So it's the shadows
that they're looking at.

00:26:42.630 --> 00:26:45.390 align:middle line:84%
There's other things on the
moon, pyramids, and things.

00:26:45.390 --> 00:26:47.690 align:middle line:84%
There's bottomless
craters on the moon.

00:26:47.690 --> 00:26:51.050 align:middle line:84%
Some of them think that
the moon is hollow.

00:26:51.050 --> 00:26:56.840 align:middle line:84%
The moon rang like a bell during
the Apollo mission, supposedly.

00:26:56.840 --> 00:26:59.510 align:middle line:84%
Here's one of the
bottomless craters.

00:26:59.510 --> 00:27:01.980 align:middle line:84%
So there are a number of craters
on the moon that they just

00:27:01.980 --> 00:27:03.640 align:middle line:90%
can't find the bottom of.

00:27:03.640 --> 00:27:05.880 align:middle line:84%
There's other things
moving around the moon.

00:27:05.880 --> 00:27:08.370 align:middle line:84%
Now the Russian--
at the same time

00:27:08.370 --> 00:27:11.290 align:middle line:84%
NASA was sending probes
and stuff to the moon,

00:27:11.290 --> 00:27:14.770 align:middle line:84%
the Russians were sending what
they called the Zond probes.

00:27:14.770 --> 00:27:17.010 align:middle line:10%
And most Americans aren't
familiar with these photos,

00:27:17.010 --> 00:27:24.510 align:middle line:10%
but the Zond 3 photo from 1965
shows what is a 20-mile-high

00:27:24.510 --> 00:27:29.000 align:middle line:10%
tower on the moon,
20 miles high.

00:27:29.000 --> 00:27:31.123 align:middle line:90%
Here it is.

00:27:31.123 --> 00:27:32.040 align:middle line:90%
This is another photo.

00:27:32.040 --> 00:27:35.540 align:middle line:84%
So yeah, there are, apparently,
giant towers on the moon.

00:27:35.540 --> 00:27:38.690 align:middle line:84%
NASA's not telling
us about that.

00:27:38.690 --> 00:27:41.630 align:middle line:84%
Here's another Zond 3
photo of what apparently

00:27:41.630 --> 00:27:43.830 align:middle line:90%
is a dome on the moon.

00:27:43.830 --> 00:27:46.520 align:middle line:84%
There are structures
on the moon, I believe.

00:27:46.520 --> 00:27:49.700 align:middle line:84%
There are things that look
like ziggurats and things

00:27:49.700 --> 00:27:52.630 align:middle line:90%
like that on the moon.

00:27:52.630 --> 00:27:54.680 align:middle line:84%
Other kind of other
things on the moon--

00:27:54.680 --> 00:28:00.250 align:middle line:84%
I mean, NASA's
essentially just keeping--

00:28:00.250 --> 00:28:02.470 align:middle line:84%
they don't want
to talk about it.

00:28:02.470 --> 00:28:07.752 align:middle line:84%
By the way, NASA isn't
the only space program.

00:28:07.752 --> 00:28:10.790 align:middle line:84%
Here's another what seems
to be a craft on the moon.

00:28:10.790 --> 00:28:14.170 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, until the Space
Force was solidified,

00:28:14.170 --> 00:28:17.680 align:middle line:84%
the Navy had their
own space program.

00:28:17.680 --> 00:28:20.210 align:middle line:84%
The Army had their
own space program.

00:28:20.210 --> 00:28:22.790 align:middle line:84%
The Air Force had their
own space program.

00:28:22.790 --> 00:28:24.730 align:middle line:90%
And then there was NASA.

00:28:24.730 --> 00:28:27.620 align:middle line:84%
So everything NASA
does is public domain.

00:28:27.620 --> 00:28:31.840 align:middle line:84%
Every photo that NASA takes
belongs to the American people.

00:28:31.840 --> 00:28:33.400 align:middle line:90%
It's all public domain.

00:28:33.400 --> 00:28:35.290 align:middle line:90%
And it's all to be above board.

00:28:35.290 --> 00:28:37.660 align:middle line:84%
And everything now, as it
does, we're supposed to--

00:28:37.660 --> 00:28:39.340 align:middle line:90%
they're supposed to tell us.

00:28:39.340 --> 00:28:43.680 align:middle line:84%
But that's not the case with the
Navy space program or the Army

00:28:43.680 --> 00:28:44.480 align:middle line:90%
space program.

00:28:44.480 --> 00:28:46.890 align:middle line:84%
Everything they
do is top secret.

00:28:46.890 --> 00:28:48.670 align:middle line:84%
And they launch
rockets and stuff too.

00:28:48.670 --> 00:28:50.160 align:middle line:90%
But you never hear about that.

00:28:50.160 --> 00:28:54.360 align:middle line:84%
I was up in Alaska last year
doing the Alaska Triangle show

00:28:54.360 --> 00:28:55.410 align:middle line:90%
for "Ancient Aliens."

00:28:55.410 --> 00:28:56.400 align:middle line:90%
And I was talking to the guys.

00:28:56.400 --> 00:28:57.942 align:middle line:84%
And they started
telling me about how

00:28:57.942 --> 00:29:02.280 align:middle line:84%
the Army launches rockets from
Kodiak Island up in Alaska.

00:29:02.280 --> 00:29:03.670 align:middle line:90%
And you never hear about that.

00:29:03.670 --> 00:29:04.540 align:middle line:90%
I didn't know about that.

00:29:04.540 --> 00:29:05.498 align:middle line:90%
And I was like, really?

00:29:05.498 --> 00:29:08.160 align:middle line:84%
He's like, oh, yeah, they
launch rockets constantly

00:29:08.160 --> 00:29:10.965 align:middle line:90%
from Kodiak Island into space.

00:29:10.965 --> 00:29:12.340 align:middle line:84%
We don't know what
they're doing.

00:29:12.340 --> 00:29:16.140 align:middle line:84%
I mean, the Navy and these guys,
they can have their own space

00:29:16.140 --> 00:29:20.128 align:middle line:84%
platforms and space stations
and stations on the moon,

00:29:20.128 --> 00:29:21.420 align:middle line:90%
but they don't have to tell us.

00:29:21.420 --> 00:29:22.570 align:middle line:90%
They're not NASA.

00:29:22.570 --> 00:29:27.150 align:middle line:84%
They're the military, and
things they do are top secret.

00:29:27.150 --> 00:29:29.860 align:middle line:84%
Here's this craft
also on the moon.

00:29:29.860 --> 00:29:31.440 align:middle line:90%
I mean, there might be--

00:29:31.440 --> 00:29:35.130 align:middle line:84%
as far as I'm
concerned, we may have--

00:29:35.130 --> 00:29:36.310 align:middle line:90%
NASA doesn't.

00:29:36.310 --> 00:29:38.520 align:middle line:84%
But the Army, the
American military

00:29:38.520 --> 00:29:40.570 align:middle line:84%
probably has all kinds
of bases on the moon.

00:29:40.570 --> 00:29:41.670 align:middle line:90%
We don't know.

00:29:41.670 --> 00:29:43.830 align:middle line:84%
There's no reason
why they don't.

00:29:43.830 --> 00:29:44.980 align:middle line:90%
So here we go.

00:29:44.980 --> 00:29:46.970 align:middle line:90%
Pyramids and stuff on the moon.

00:29:46.970 --> 00:29:50.980 align:middle line:84%
Here's what seems to be like
some kind of big Tesla device

00:29:50.980 --> 00:29:53.502 align:middle line:90%
or something on the moon.

00:29:53.502 --> 00:29:54.820 align:middle line:90%
Here's a close-up of it.

00:29:54.820 --> 00:29:57.690 align:middle line:10%
I mean, it's hard to see
what these things are.

00:29:57.690 --> 00:29:59.550 align:middle line:10%
We'll go briefly here to Mars.

00:29:59.550 --> 00:30:02.310 align:middle line:84%
And what we have
on Mars, Mars has

00:30:02.310 --> 00:30:06.450 align:middle line:90%
two moons, Phobos and Deimos.

00:30:06.450 --> 00:30:08.080 align:middle line:90%
Here's the Phobos.

00:30:08.080 --> 00:30:09.690 align:middle line:90%
It has all these striations.

00:30:09.690 --> 00:30:10.560 align:middle line:90%
They're small.

00:30:10.560 --> 00:30:12.490 align:middle line:90%
the moons are not like our moon.

00:30:12.490 --> 00:30:18.970 align:middle line:84%
And on the moon of Phobos
is also this giant tower.

00:30:18.970 --> 00:30:20.730 align:middle line:90%
And you see the shadow from it.

00:30:20.730 --> 00:30:22.090 align:middle line:90%
It's this huge tower.

00:30:22.090 --> 00:30:24.960 align:middle line:84%
They call it the
monolith of Phobos.

00:30:24.960 --> 00:30:26.680 align:middle line:90%
Here's another photo of it.

00:30:26.680 --> 00:30:31.020 align:middle line:84%
So yeah, it's casting
this big, big shadow here.

00:30:31.020 --> 00:30:32.590 align:middle line:90%
And it's totally real.

00:30:32.590 --> 00:30:33.940 align:middle line:90%
NASA admits this.

00:30:33.940 --> 00:30:35.630 align:middle line:90%
They don't know what it is.

00:30:35.630 --> 00:30:38.790 align:middle line:84%
These are some ideas of
what this thing looked

00:30:38.790 --> 00:30:42.570 align:middle line:84%
like, this huge tower
going up, kind of different

00:30:42.570 --> 00:30:44.910 align:middle line:84%
than the tower
that's on the moon.

00:30:44.910 --> 00:30:49.170 align:middle line:84%
And then the Deimos is
the other moon of Mars.

00:30:49.170 --> 00:30:52.620 align:middle line:84%
Even Carl Sagan sort of
admitted that he thought

00:30:52.620 --> 00:30:54.820 align:middle line:90%
they were probably artificial.

00:30:54.820 --> 00:30:59.030 align:middle line:10%
Then the Russians sent a probe.

00:30:59.030 --> 00:31:01.370 align:middle line:10%
They called it the
Phobos 2 probe.

00:31:01.370 --> 00:31:02.840 align:middle line:10%
It went to Mars.

00:31:02.840 --> 00:31:07.120 align:middle line:84%
And it took this photo
of this big craft

00:31:07.120 --> 00:31:15.430 align:middle line:84%
here, huge, gigantically huge
craft by the moon at Phobos.

00:31:15.430 --> 00:31:20.740 align:middle line:84%
And then after that, the Russian
probe was shot out of orbit.

00:31:20.740 --> 00:31:22.750 align:middle line:90%
It was actually just shot out.

00:31:22.750 --> 00:31:29.350 align:middle line:84%
So this is that photo, again,
comes from the Russians.

00:31:29.350 --> 00:31:31.240 align:middle line:90%
And here we go also.

00:31:31.240 --> 00:31:35.020 align:middle line:10%
