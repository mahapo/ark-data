00:00:04.401 --> 00:00:07.824 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:07.824 --> 00:00:11.460 align:middle line:90%


00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:12.260 align:middle line:90%
>> All right.

00:00:12.260 --> 00:00:16.870 align:middle line:10%
So the body, like I said, I love
the body, my nursing career,

00:00:16.870 --> 00:00:18.950 align:middle line:10%
and it means so much to me.

00:00:18.950 --> 00:00:22.220 align:middle line:84%
And I've always been
fascinated with how it works.

00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:26.020 align:middle line:84%
So when my mother started
getting information

00:00:26.020 --> 00:00:29.020 align:middle line:84%
in her sessions where
they were talking about,

00:00:29.020 --> 00:00:32.200 align:middle line:84%
well, they had this issue
going on with the knee.

00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:34.990 align:middle line:84%
And this is what we were
trying to tell them.

00:00:34.990 --> 00:00:37.150 align:middle line:84%
And she would tell me,
guess what happened?

00:00:37.150 --> 00:00:38.650 align:middle line:90%
I'm like, what?

00:00:38.650 --> 00:00:40.220 align:middle line:90%
And it made so much sense.

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:44.870 align:middle line:84%
I'm like, gosh, that's
logical in an illogical way.

00:00:44.870 --> 00:00:51.040 align:middle line:84%
It's not the scientific
medical stuff I was taught.

00:00:51.040 --> 00:00:52.810 align:middle line:84%
If you have a knee
bothering you,

00:00:52.810 --> 00:00:55.060 align:middle line:84%
it was some injury that
you got previously,

00:00:55.060 --> 00:00:57.400 align:middle line:84%
if something happened, or the
cartilage is wearing down,

00:00:57.400 --> 00:00:58.200 align:middle line:90%
and it's thin.

00:00:58.200 --> 00:00:59.530 align:middle line:90%
And you have no carti--

00:00:59.530 --> 00:01:00.890 align:middle line:90%
see, that scientific.

00:01:00.890 --> 00:01:03.370 align:middle line:90%
This is the reason for this.

00:01:03.370 --> 00:01:04.830 align:middle line:90%
But that's not it at all.

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:07.380 align:middle line:90%


00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:08.250 align:middle line:90%
It goes back.

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:09.690 align:middle line:90%
Why did that even happen?

00:01:09.690 --> 00:01:11.610 align:middle line:90%
Why did that accident happen?

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:13.450 align:middle line:90%
See, that was a message.

00:01:13.450 --> 00:01:17.130 align:middle line:84%
The cartilage being
down, that's a message.

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:18.610 align:middle line:90%
Where are those coming from?

00:01:18.610 --> 00:01:20.640 align:middle line:84%
So you have to keep
going back and back

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:25.290 align:middle line:84%
and back until you get to the
root cause, the root message,

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:26.800 align:middle line:84%
because they've
been talking to you.

00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:29.342 align:middle line:84%
If you've had something that's
been going on for a long time,

00:01:29.342 --> 00:01:31.680 align:middle line:84%
and, now, it's considered
a chronic condition,

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:34.120 align:middle line:90%
chronic means long time.

00:01:34.120 --> 00:01:35.010 align:middle line:90%
It's been happening.

00:01:35.010 --> 00:01:36.770 align:middle line:90%
Acute means it just started.

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:37.570 align:middle line:90%
It's very quick.

00:01:37.570 --> 00:01:38.830 align:middle line:90%
Something's happening now.

00:01:38.830 --> 00:01:41.557 align:middle line:84%
And chronic is
dragging the hell out.

00:01:41.557 --> 00:01:43.140 align:middle line:84%
You've had it all
your life, or you're

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:45.173 align:middle line:84%
going to have it the
rest of your life.

00:01:45.173 --> 00:01:46.590 align:middle line:84%
Don't you love how
they give those

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:48.410 align:middle line:84%
diagnoses to
something you're going

00:01:48.410 --> 00:01:49.660 align:middle line:90%
to have the rest of your life.

00:01:49.660 --> 00:01:51.150 align:middle line:84%
You're going to have to be
on this medication forever

00:01:51.150 --> 00:01:51.950 align:middle line:90%
and ever.

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:54.110 align:middle line:90%
There is no cure.

00:01:54.110 --> 00:01:55.966 align:middle line:84%
Thank you so much
for that diagnosis.

00:01:55.966 --> 00:01:57.800 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHING]

00:01:57.800 --> 00:01:59.725 align:middle line:90%
Wonderful message of hope.

00:01:59.725 --> 00:02:02.940 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHING]

00:02:02.940 --> 00:02:04.630 align:middle line:84%
Not to be down on
the medical system,

00:02:04.630 --> 00:02:07.020 align:middle line:84%
I was a part of it
for a long time.

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:08.610 align:middle line:90%
It has a very critical role.

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:10.330 align:middle line:90%
And I fully endorse it.

00:02:10.330 --> 00:02:12.160 align:middle line:84%
I fully am supportive
of that role.

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:15.090 align:middle line:84%
But when it comes to dashing
people's hopes and dreams

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:19.560 align:middle line:84%
and cutting their
lives short, that's--

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:21.780 align:middle line:90%
you don't understand.

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:24.070 align:middle line:90%
There's more to this story.

00:02:24.070 --> 00:02:25.660 align:middle line:84%
There's more to
what's going on here.

00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:28.410 align:middle line:84%
And that's what I want
people to understand.

00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:31.000 align:middle line:84%
So the body, what are
some things that--

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:33.260 align:middle line:84%
what are some ailments,
common ailments in the body?

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:35.552 align:middle line:84%
And we can go through what
they might be trying to say.

00:02:35.552 --> 00:02:36.676 align:middle line:90%
>> [INDISTINCT]

00:02:36.676 --> 00:02:38.470 align:middle line:90%
>> Carpal tunnel.

00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:39.340 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:02:39.340 --> 00:02:42.090 align:middle line:84%
I heard-- we'll start
with some easy ones.

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:42.890 align:middle line:90%
How about that?

00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:44.015 align:middle line:90%
I'm going to pick them now.

00:02:44.015 --> 00:02:45.790 align:middle line:84%
Let's start with--
the eyes are so easy.

00:02:45.790 --> 00:02:48.680 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHS]

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:50.370 align:middle line:84%
Something's going
on at the eyes.

00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:52.178 align:middle line:84%
What does-- what
did the eyes do?

00:02:52.178 --> 00:02:53.220 align:middle line:90%
This is what you guys do.

00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:55.100 align:middle line:90%
What is that body part do?

00:02:55.100 --> 00:02:56.310 align:middle line:90%
It sees.

00:02:56.310 --> 00:02:58.100 align:middle line:84%
So what do you think
it might be trying

00:02:58.100 --> 00:03:00.920 align:middle line:84%
to tell you if something's
going on with your eyes?

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:02.850 align:middle line:90%
What are you not seeing?

00:03:02.850 --> 00:03:05.130 align:middle line:84%
Or it goes further, what
are you not seeing clearly.

00:03:05.130 --> 00:03:08.620 align:middle line:90%
What are you not willing to see?

00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:09.420 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:11.730 align:middle line:84%
See, it goes more than just
what are you are seeing.

00:03:11.730 --> 00:03:15.020 align:middle line:84%
See, there's-- and, usually,
when I put those other ones out

00:03:15.020 --> 00:03:17.840 align:middle line:84%
there, use this like,
I know what it is.

00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:20.390 align:middle line:90%
It's those other parts.

00:03:20.390 --> 00:03:21.500 align:middle line:90%
That's one of the things.

00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:25.140 align:middle line:84%
We-- this metaphysical world,
we do this metaphysical ease.

00:03:25.140 --> 00:03:26.750 align:middle line:90%
We all the speak that we say.

00:03:26.750 --> 00:03:28.700 align:middle line:84%
And it goes right
over the heads.

00:03:28.700 --> 00:03:31.790 align:middle line:84%
Like people, we have
to make it relatable.

00:03:31.790 --> 00:03:35.630 align:middle line:84%
We have to bring it into
our day-to-day language.

00:03:35.630 --> 00:03:37.400 align:middle line:90%
This is how we speak.

00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:40.410 align:middle line:84%
We don't-- you're not
speaking your truth.

00:03:40.410 --> 00:03:42.640 align:middle line:90%
Who knows what that means.

00:03:42.640 --> 00:03:43.440 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:03:43.440 --> 00:03:44.380 align:middle line:90%
It sounds beautiful.

00:03:44.380 --> 00:03:46.090 align:middle line:84%
And we know what it
means hypothetically.

00:03:46.090 --> 00:03:48.150 align:middle line:84%
But if I said,
OK, anything going

00:03:48.150 --> 00:03:50.580 align:middle line:84%
on in this area, your mouth,
your jaw, your neck, all

00:03:50.580 --> 00:03:53.500 align:middle line:84%
of this, there's
something you need to say.

00:03:53.500 --> 00:03:55.690 align:middle line:90%
And you're not saying it.

00:03:55.690 --> 00:03:57.260 align:middle line:90%
Does that pin it down?

00:03:57.260 --> 00:03:59.970 align:middle line:90%
Do you know exactly what it is?

00:03:59.970 --> 00:04:00.770 align:middle line:90%
Every time.

00:04:00.770 --> 00:04:02.645 align:middle line:84%
If I put it in those
words, but if I'm saying

00:04:02.645 --> 00:04:04.620 align:middle line:84%
you're not speaking your
truth, what is that?

00:04:04.620 --> 00:04:05.780 align:middle line:90%
What's my truth?

00:04:05.780 --> 00:04:08.810 align:middle line:84%
See how it's-- we've
got to keep it here.

00:04:08.810 --> 00:04:12.010 align:middle line:84%
And I know this
is just some of--

00:04:12.010 --> 00:04:13.010 align:middle line:90%
I don't know what it is.

00:04:13.010 --> 00:04:15.410 align:middle line:84%
I don't need to justify
it or explain it away.

00:04:15.410 --> 00:04:17.640 align:middle line:90%
It's just stuff that happens.

00:04:17.640 --> 00:04:19.170 align:middle line:84%
I feel like that's
one of my roles

00:04:19.170 --> 00:04:24.420 align:middle line:84%
is to keep things down to
Earth, more easily understood,

00:04:24.420 --> 00:04:26.980 align:middle line:84%
or just to keep it here
where we can relate to it.

00:04:26.980 --> 00:04:28.500 align:middle line:90%
This is our life.

00:04:28.500 --> 00:04:30.730 align:middle line:90%
And we want to understand this.

00:04:30.730 --> 00:04:33.503 align:middle line:84%
So let's put it in terms
that we understand.

00:04:33.503 --> 00:04:34.920 align:middle line:84%
There's something
you need to say.

00:04:34.920 --> 00:04:36.330 align:middle line:90%
And you're not saying it.

00:04:36.330 --> 00:04:38.400 align:middle line:90%
That's usually very clear.

00:04:38.400 --> 00:04:41.410 align:middle line:84%
So the eyes-- yeah, you're
not seeing it clearly.

00:04:41.410 --> 00:04:44.100 align:middle line:84%
There might be a situation
going on that you're just not

00:04:44.100 --> 00:04:45.370 align:middle line:90%
willing to look at.

00:04:45.370 --> 00:04:47.710 align:middle line:84%
You're not willing
to look at it fully.

00:04:47.710 --> 00:04:49.985 align:middle line:90%
Clearly, something.

00:04:49.985 --> 00:04:51.730 align:middle line:84%
The ears are along
the same line.

00:04:51.730 --> 00:04:53.330 align:middle line:90%
What are you not hearing?

00:04:53.330 --> 00:04:54.580 align:middle line:90%
What are you not listening to?

00:04:54.580 --> 00:04:56.860 align:middle line:84%
Many times, when the
ears are doing things--

00:04:56.860 --> 00:04:59.430 align:middle line:90%
and I'm telling you mine a lot--

00:04:59.430 --> 00:05:02.740 align:middle line:84%
it's usually our guidance
team is trying to talk to us.

00:05:02.740 --> 00:05:04.570 align:middle line:84%
Remember, they're
talking to us constantly.

00:05:04.570 --> 00:05:07.800 align:middle line:84%
And so sometimes that's what
the ears are trying to indicate,

00:05:07.800 --> 00:05:09.340 align:middle line:90%
is we're trying to talk to you.

00:05:09.340 --> 00:05:10.163 align:middle line:90%
Will you listen?

00:05:10.163 --> 00:05:12.580 align:middle line:84%
And it's like, no, I'll wait
until you go to another area.

00:05:12.580 --> 00:05:15.330 align:middle line:90%
So I can fully get the message.

00:05:15.330 --> 00:05:16.480 align:middle line:90%
I don't hear you.

00:05:16.480 --> 00:05:17.990 align:middle line:90%
I can't hear you.

00:05:17.990 --> 00:05:20.530 align:middle line:84%
If we believe, we
can't hear them.

00:05:20.530 --> 00:05:21.860 align:middle line:90%
OK, I heard--

00:05:21.860 --> 00:05:24.730 align:middle line:84%
OK, low back-- and the
back is really good.

00:05:24.730 --> 00:05:30.160 align:middle line:84%
We get a lot of back issues,
don't we, QHHD practitioners?

00:05:30.160 --> 00:05:31.320 align:middle line:90%
Not talking about you guys.

00:05:31.320 --> 00:05:33.070 align:middle line:84%
This is what a lot of
people come in with.

00:05:33.070 --> 00:05:34.660 align:middle line:90%
And this is one of the things.

00:05:34.660 --> 00:05:36.400 align:middle line:90%
What does the back do?

00:05:36.400 --> 00:05:37.380 align:middle line:90%
What does that spine?

00:05:37.380 --> 00:05:38.180 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, it supports.

00:05:38.180 --> 00:05:41.344 align:middle line:90%
It holds the body up.

00:05:41.344 --> 00:05:44.130 align:middle line:90%
So it's supporting you.

00:05:44.130 --> 00:05:46.090 align:middle line:84%
So what is that telling
you right there?

00:05:46.090 --> 00:05:48.050 align:middle line:90%
>> [INDISTINCT]

00:05:48.050 --> 00:05:49.590 align:middle line:90%
>> Something to do with support.

00:05:49.590 --> 00:05:50.390 align:middle line:90%
All right.

00:05:50.390 --> 00:05:52.420 align:middle line:84%
It's something to
do with support.

00:05:52.420 --> 00:05:55.228 align:middle line:84%
When it's in the low back that
I have found, it's like, OK,

00:05:55.228 --> 00:05:56.270 align:middle line:90%
we'll start from the top.

00:05:56.270 --> 00:05:57.845 align:middle line:90%
We'll just go through the back.

00:05:57.845 --> 00:06:00.470 align:middle line:84%
The shoulders-- what do the the
shoulders do in the upper back?

00:06:00.470 --> 00:06:01.637 align:middle line:90%
What do we tend to do there?

00:06:01.637 --> 00:06:04.120 align:middle line:90%


00:06:04.120 --> 00:06:04.920 align:middle line:90%
We carry.

00:06:04.920 --> 00:06:06.390 align:middle line:90%
We carry the world.

00:06:06.390 --> 00:06:10.450 align:middle line:84%
If you visualize Atlas, he's
holding the world right there.

00:06:10.450 --> 00:06:13.120 align:middle line:84%
So that's where a lot of times
we have so much responsibility.

00:06:13.120 --> 00:06:14.970 align:middle line:84%
We're carrying the
world on our shoulders.

00:06:14.970 --> 00:06:16.700 align:middle line:84%
And it's bothering
that part-- that's

00:06:16.700 --> 00:06:17.950 align:middle line:90%
where it's trying to yell out.

00:06:17.950 --> 00:06:19.700 align:middle line:84%
It's like, hey, this
is what you're doing.

00:06:19.700 --> 00:06:21.790 align:middle line:84%
As it goes down the
back, it's support.

00:06:21.790 --> 00:06:26.503 align:middle line:84%
When it gets to the low back, it
tends to be about feeling like.

00:06:26.503 --> 00:06:28.170 align:middle line:84%
And I want you to
notice the words here.

00:06:28.170 --> 00:06:31.380 align:middle line:84%
Feeling like you
don't have support.

00:06:31.380 --> 00:06:34.570 align:middle line:84%
I didn't say you
don't have support.

00:06:34.570 --> 00:06:37.320 align:middle line:90%
So you feel like you don't.

00:06:37.320 --> 00:06:40.320 align:middle line:84%
Many times, what we have gotten
when they get to the message

00:06:40.320 --> 00:06:42.720 align:middle line:84%
is that you're not
seeing your support

00:06:42.720 --> 00:06:44.460 align:middle line:90%
system that's around you.

00:06:44.460 --> 00:06:48.020 align:middle line:84%
You have one you
need to delegate.

00:06:48.020 --> 00:06:51.410 align:middle line:84%
You are feeling like you're not
supported because you are not

00:06:51.410 --> 00:06:52.590 align:middle line:90%
recognizing this.

00:06:52.590 --> 00:06:54.180 align:middle line:90%
There is much more to this.

00:06:54.180 --> 00:06:56.520 align:middle line:90%
So that's very important.

00:06:56.520 --> 00:06:58.080 align:middle line:90%
It's how you feel about it.

00:06:58.080 --> 00:07:00.270 align:middle line:84%
And sometimes, it can
come to finances, too.

00:07:00.270 --> 00:07:01.070 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:07:01.070 --> 00:07:01.870 align:middle line:90%
>> Hands.

00:07:01.870 --> 00:07:02.860 align:middle line:90%
>> What do hands do?

00:07:02.860 --> 00:07:03.660 align:middle line:90%
>> They hurt.

00:07:03.660 --> 00:07:04.460 align:middle line:90%
>> They hurt.

00:07:04.460 --> 00:07:08.160 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHS] They hurt.

00:07:08.160 --> 00:07:10.810 align:middle line:84%
So before they hurt,
what did they do?

00:07:10.810 --> 00:07:12.240 align:middle line:90%
They hold things.

00:07:12.240 --> 00:07:13.120 align:middle line:90%
That's what hands do.

00:07:13.120 --> 00:07:15.950 align:middle line:84%
They hold, they
grip, and they touch.

00:07:15.950 --> 00:07:16.750 align:middle line:90%
All right.

00:07:16.750 --> 00:07:18.240 align:middle line:84%
So if there's something
going on with them,

00:07:18.240 --> 00:07:19.510 align:middle line:90%
then it's something to do.

00:07:19.510 --> 00:07:22.770 align:middle line:84%
Many times, it can be
holding on to something.

00:07:22.770 --> 00:07:24.215 align:middle line:84%
And they're wanting
you to let go.

00:07:24.215 --> 00:07:26.790 align:middle line:90%


00:07:26.790 --> 00:07:30.960 align:middle line:84%
So you look at what
does that body part do.

00:07:30.960 --> 00:07:34.060 align:middle line:84%
And what I'm telling
you are general things.

00:07:34.060 --> 00:07:35.680 align:middle line:90%
They're going to be very close.

00:07:35.680 --> 00:07:36.760 align:middle line:90%
It's very close.

00:07:36.760 --> 00:07:39.150 align:middle line:84%
But then we'll go on to
next how you actually

00:07:39.150 --> 00:07:40.790 align:middle line:90%
get your own personal message.

00:07:40.790 --> 00:07:41.590 align:middle line:90%
All right?

00:07:41.590 --> 00:07:42.390 align:middle line:90%
To understand it.

00:07:42.390 --> 00:07:45.000 align:middle line:84%
But these are clues
to what it's about.

00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:47.400 align:middle line:90%
I heard-- pardon--

00:07:47.400 --> 00:07:48.280 align:middle line:90%
the heart.

00:07:48.280 --> 00:07:49.080 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:07:49.080 --> 00:07:51.840 align:middle line:84%
She's saying AFib, atrial
fib, atrial fibrillation.

00:07:51.840 --> 00:07:55.695 align:middle line:84%
That has to do with the
heart, irregular heartbeat.

00:07:55.695 --> 00:07:57.070 align:middle line:84%
We're just going
to keep it down.

00:07:57.070 --> 00:07:59.362 align:middle line:84%
We're not going to go, oh,
this heart rhythm means this

00:07:59.362 --> 00:08:00.840 align:middle line:90%
and his heart rhythm means that.

00:08:00.840 --> 00:08:03.070 align:middle line:84%
It all comes down to
it comes to the heart.

00:08:03.070 --> 00:08:05.220 align:middle line:90%
What does the heart--

00:08:05.220 --> 00:08:08.100 align:middle line:90%
what does the heart represent?

00:08:08.100 --> 00:08:09.910 align:middle line:90%
Emotions, exactly.

00:08:09.910 --> 00:08:10.960 align:middle line:90%
It's the seat of emotion.

00:08:10.960 --> 00:08:13.050 align:middle line:84%
What do they do on
Valentine's Day?

00:08:13.050 --> 00:08:16.660 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, it's the symbol of love.

00:08:16.660 --> 00:08:17.460 align:middle line:90%
All right.

00:08:17.460 --> 00:08:19.070 align:middle line:90%
So it's the seat of emotion.

00:08:19.070 --> 00:08:21.930 align:middle line:84%
It's the caring,
it's all of that.

00:08:21.930 --> 00:08:24.740 align:middle line:84%
So if there's something
going on with the heart,

00:08:24.740 --> 00:08:27.870 align:middle line:84%
then I would be looking at
the relationship department.

00:08:27.870 --> 00:08:30.540 align:middle line:84%
There's something going
on in the love department,

00:08:30.540 --> 00:08:31.590 align:middle line:90%
There's just something.

00:08:31.590 --> 00:08:33.890 align:middle line:84%
And it's trying to get
your attention saying

00:08:33.890 --> 00:08:35.906 align:middle line:90%
there's something happening.

00:08:35.906 --> 00:08:37.619 align:middle line:90%
>> Skin.

00:08:37.619 --> 00:08:38.419 align:middle line:90%
>> Skin.

00:08:38.419 --> 00:08:39.219 align:middle line:90%
I heard skin.

00:08:39.219 --> 00:08:41.078 align:middle line:90%
What about the skin?

00:08:41.078 --> 00:08:42.049 align:middle line:90%
>> Eczema.

00:08:42.049 --> 00:08:43.370 align:middle line:90%
>> Eczema.

00:08:43.370 --> 00:08:45.230 align:middle line:90%
Eczema is a good one.

00:08:45.230 --> 00:08:46.890 align:middle line:90%
What does the skin do?

00:08:46.890 --> 00:08:47.910 align:middle line:90%
It protects the body.

00:08:47.910 --> 00:08:48.810 align:middle line:90%
It's covering you.

00:08:48.810 --> 00:08:49.680 align:middle line:90%
It's protecting.

00:08:49.680 --> 00:08:51.390 align:middle line:84%
It protects all the
internal organs.

00:08:51.390 --> 00:08:52.390 align:middle line:90%
It protects the muscles.

00:08:52.390 --> 00:08:54.422 align:middle line:90%
It protects everything.

00:08:54.422 --> 00:08:56.130 align:middle line:90%
It's the detox system.

00:08:56.130 --> 00:08:57.900 align:middle line:84%
It's the largest
organ of the body.

00:08:57.900 --> 00:08:59.455 align:middle line:90%
It's doing so much work.

00:08:59.455 --> 00:09:00.830 align:middle line:84%
But the biggest
thing it's doing,

00:09:00.830 --> 00:09:02.580 align:middle line:84%
it's protecting-- most
of the time, that's

00:09:02.580 --> 00:09:05.120 align:middle line:84%
where the message is
coming from protection.

00:09:05.120 --> 00:09:06.800 align:middle line:84%
Let's go on to
some other things.

00:09:06.800 --> 00:09:08.550 align:middle line:84%
I'm dropping seeds is
what I'm doing here.

00:09:08.550 --> 00:09:09.350 align:middle line:90%
>> Asthma.

00:09:09.350 --> 00:09:10.236 align:middle line:90%
>> Allergies.

00:09:10.236 --> 00:09:11.180 align:middle line:90%
>> Ulcers.

00:09:11.180 --> 00:09:12.190 align:middle line:90%
>> Ulcers?

00:09:12.190 --> 00:09:12.990 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:09:12.990 --> 00:09:14.760 align:middle line:90%
I heard ulcers, asthma--

00:09:14.760 --> 00:09:15.560 align:middle line:90%
>> Allergy.

00:09:15.560 --> 00:09:17.420 align:middle line:90%
>> --and allergies.

00:09:17.420 --> 00:09:18.920 align:middle line:90%
>> Blood conditions.

00:09:18.920 --> 00:09:19.830 align:middle line:90%
>> Blood conditions.

00:09:19.830 --> 00:09:20.690 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:09:20.690 --> 00:09:22.080 align:middle line:90%
Gosh, you guys.

00:09:22.080 --> 00:09:23.370 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHS]

00:09:23.370 --> 00:09:24.170 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:09:24.170 --> 00:09:25.893 align:middle line:90%
Let's start with ulcers.

00:09:25.893 --> 00:09:27.310 align:middle line:84%
Where is this--
where's the ulcer?

00:09:27.310 --> 00:09:29.880 align:middle line:90%
In the stomach.

00:09:29.880 --> 00:09:31.210 align:middle line:90%
What does the stomach do?

00:09:31.210 --> 00:09:32.560 align:middle line:84%
She's talking about
ulcers in the stomach.

00:09:32.560 --> 00:09:33.610 align:middle line:90%
What does the stomach do?

00:09:33.610 --> 00:09:34.600 align:middle line:90%
It digests.

00:09:34.600 --> 00:09:36.780 align:middle line:90%
What does it digest?

00:09:36.780 --> 00:09:37.590 align:middle line:90%
Food.

00:09:37.590 --> 00:09:38.660 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, that's its purpose.

00:09:38.660 --> 00:09:39.460 align:middle line:90%
It digests food.

00:09:39.460 --> 00:09:41.815 align:middle line:90%
And then what does it do?

00:09:41.815 --> 00:09:45.535 align:middle line:90%
[OVERLAPPING SPEECH]

00:09:45.535 --> 00:09:47.030 align:middle line:90%


00:09:47.030 --> 00:09:47.880 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, it goes on.

00:09:47.880 --> 00:09:49.172 align:middle line:90%
What would happen if it didn't?

00:09:49.172 --> 00:09:51.970 align:middle line:90%


00:09:51.970 --> 00:09:53.140 align:middle line:90%
It would be bad.

00:09:53.140 --> 00:09:54.110 align:middle line:90%
In what way?

00:09:54.110 --> 00:09:56.940 align:middle line:84%
Let's get-- because this is
important for that message.

00:09:56.940 --> 00:10:00.490 align:middle line:84%
What would happen if
that did not move on out?

00:10:00.490 --> 00:10:02.880 align:middle line:90%
It'd poison the body.

00:10:02.880 --> 00:10:04.660 align:middle line:90%
It's festering.

00:10:04.660 --> 00:10:05.460 align:middle line:90%
>> Clogging.

00:10:05.460 --> 00:10:06.930 align:middle line:90%
>> Clogging.

00:10:06.930 --> 00:10:07.730 align:middle line:90%
>> Die.

00:10:07.730 --> 00:10:09.290 align:middle line:90%
>> You would die.

00:10:09.290 --> 00:10:10.100 align:middle line:90%
You would die.

00:10:10.100 --> 00:10:13.790 align:middle line:84%
If that food that you
just ate could not

00:10:13.790 --> 00:10:17.360 align:middle line:84%
be processed and
pass on out, you

00:10:17.360 --> 00:10:20.480 align:middle line:84%
would die because it's lots
and lots of toxins and things

00:10:20.480 --> 00:10:22.470 align:middle line:90%
that do not belong in the body.

00:10:22.470 --> 00:10:25.300 align:middle line:84%
What else do we
digest besides food?

00:10:25.300 --> 00:10:26.480 align:middle line:90%
>> Emotions.

00:10:26.480 --> 00:10:27.650 align:middle line:90%
>> Emotions.

00:10:27.650 --> 00:10:28.640 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, exactly.

00:10:28.640 --> 00:10:29.557 align:middle line:90%
We stuff the emotions.

00:10:29.557 --> 00:10:30.690 align:middle line:90%
So we digest emotions.

00:10:30.690 --> 00:10:32.590 align:middle line:90%
What else?

00:10:32.590 --> 00:10:33.530 align:middle line:90%
Information.

00:10:33.530 --> 00:10:34.330 align:middle line:90%
I didn't hear.

00:10:34.330 --> 00:10:35.000 align:middle line:90%
I couldn't--

00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:35.560 align:middle line:90%
>> Bad news.

00:10:35.560 --> 00:10:36.470 align:middle line:90%
>> Bad news.

00:10:36.470 --> 00:10:37.270 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:10:37.270 --> 00:10:40.900 align:middle line:84%
So inform-- experiences,
intuition, all of these things

00:10:40.900 --> 00:10:42.130 align:middle line:90%
are coming in.

00:10:42.130 --> 00:10:43.580 align:middle line:90%
And we are digesting them.

00:10:43.580 --> 00:10:44.600 align:middle line:90%
We're processing them.

00:10:44.600 --> 00:10:46.375 align:middle line:84%
If I were to say, what
all do we process?

00:10:46.375 --> 00:10:47.750 align:middle line:84%
Because that's
what digestion is.

00:10:47.750 --> 00:10:49.220 align:middle line:90%
It's processing the food.

00:10:49.220 --> 00:10:51.370 align:middle line:90%
What do we process?

00:10:51.370 --> 00:10:53.300 align:middle line:90%
It's all these things.

00:10:53.300 --> 00:10:56.330 align:middle line:84%
So what happens if
they get processed

00:10:56.330 --> 00:10:57.640 align:middle line:90%
and they don't pass on out?

00:10:57.640 --> 00:11:01.578 align:middle line:90%


00:11:01.578 --> 00:11:03.370 align:middle line:84%
They're just sitting
there, and they churn,

00:11:03.370 --> 00:11:06.010 align:middle line:84%
and they churn, and they churn,
and they create something.

00:11:06.010 --> 00:11:08.200 align:middle line:84%
They're trying to
get out some way.

00:11:08.200 --> 00:11:11.770 align:middle line:84%
So an ulcer is an irritation
in the surface where

00:11:11.770 --> 00:11:13.400 align:middle line:90%
it's trying to poke through.

00:11:13.400 --> 00:11:15.160 align:middle line:84%
It's trying to move
its way on out.

00:11:15.160 --> 00:11:17.270 align:middle line:84%

long, too long, too long.

And it's going to
come out some way.

What does that tell
you about emotions?

00:11:21.950 --> 00:11:24.320 align:middle line:84%
They're going to
come out some way.

00:11:24.320 --> 00:11:25.187 align:middle line:90%
They have to.

00:11:25.187 --> 00:11:26.270 align:middle line:90%
They have to be expressed.

00:11:26.270 --> 00:11:29.180 align:middle line:84%
That's why I meant earlier
about, if you have something

00:11:29.180 --> 00:11:31.890 align:middle line:90%
going on, feel the emotions.

00:11:31.890 --> 00:11:33.470 align:middle line:84%
That was one of the
reasons that you

00:11:33.470 --> 00:11:37.080 align:middle line:84%
had the experience was because
I want to feel these emotions.

00:11:39.080 --> 00:11:42.560 align:middle line:84%
to planet Earth
because it is notorious

00:11:42.560 --> 00:11:48.770 align:middle line:84%
for having these beautiful,
wonderful, so many emotions,

And what the ETs
are amazed at us

00:11:52.790 --> 00:11:55.660 align:middle line:84%
is because they might
have a few emotions.

00:11:55.660 --> 00:11:59.210 align:middle line:84%
And they're closely related,
where ours are extremes.

00:11:59.210 --> 00:12:01.600 align:middle line:84%
And they say, what's
amazing about us

00:12:01.600 --> 00:12:05.320 align:middle line:84%
is we can go from this extreme
to this extreme, just like that.

Would you agree?

00:12:07.070 --> 00:12:07.870 align:middle line:90%
I hate you.

00:12:07.870 --> 00:12:08.910 align:middle line:90%

I'm so excited.

How do you do that?

This is why we came here.

We wanted to feel that.

We learned all about it in the

00:12:24.820 --> 00:12:28.420 align:middle line:84%
we were studying in the
beautiful libraries.

These emotions.

00:12:30.010 --> 00:12:32.390 align:middle line:90%
I can learn so much.

We can learn 10 times faster

whenever these things are

there's something that
you don't want a stomach.

00:14:13.178 --> 00:14:14.220 align:middle line:90%

things that are pushing it out

it back into balance.

And then it starts
going, help, help, help.

00:16:39.710 --> 00:16:42.240 align:middle line:84%
And that's what the message is
like, you're out of balance.

00:16:42.240 --> 00:16:43.410 align:middle line:90%
That's usually the message.

00:16:43.410 --> 00:16:44.940 align:middle line:90%
You are so out of balance.

00:16:44.940 --> 00:16:46.070 align:middle line:90%
I had that one myself.

you're out of balance,

you're out of balance,
you're out of balance.

meant, except on my life,

00:16:54.930 --> 00:16:55.860 align:middle line:90%
I had nothing else.

00:16:55.860 --> 00:16:56.880 align:middle line:84%
I'm like, how am
I out of balance?

00:16:56.880 --> 00:16:57.690 align:middle line:90%
I don't understand.

00:16:57.690 --> 00:17:02.590 align:middle line:84%
I don't see-- the body is
just trying to tell you.

00:17:02.590 --> 00:17:03.390 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:17:03.390 --> 00:17:04.490 align:middle line:90%
>> Bladder.

00:17:04.490 --> 00:17:06.619 align:middle line:90%
>> Bladder OK.

00:17:06.619 --> 00:17:08.039 align:middle line:90%
What does the bladder do?

00:17:08.039 --> 00:17:08.839 align:middle line:90%
>> Release.

00:17:08.839 --> 00:17:09.750 align:middle line:90%
>> It releases.

00:17:09.750 --> 00:17:11.040 align:middle line:90%
Yes, it releases what?

00:17:11.040 --> 00:17:13.543 align:middle line:90%
Releases urine.

00:17:13.543 --> 00:17:14.960 align:middle line:84%
It releases whatever
was in there.

00:17:14.960 --> 00:17:16.050 align:middle line:90%
It was urine.

00:17:16.050 --> 00:17:18.020 align:middle line:84%
And what does the
urine have in it?

00:17:18.020 --> 00:17:19.819 align:middle line:90%
Toxins.

00:17:19.819 --> 00:17:20.760 align:middle line:90%
There we go.

00:17:20.760 --> 00:17:22.619 align:middle line:90%
So that is the holder.

00:17:22.619 --> 00:17:24.710 align:middle line:84%
The ones that are actually
filtering those toxins

00:17:24.710 --> 00:17:25.770 align:middle line:90%
are the kidneys.

00:17:25.770 --> 00:17:30.020 align:middle line:84%
So anything in the kidneys,
now you're looking at there's

00:17:30.020 --> 00:17:30.980 align:middle line:90%
toxins going on.

00:17:30.980 --> 00:17:32.180 align:middle line:90%
Is there a toxic situation?

00:17:32.180 --> 00:17:33.450 align:middle line:84%
Or is there something
going on in the life?

00:17:33.450 --> 00:17:34.970 align:middle line:84%
But when it's the
bladder, that's

00:17:34.970 --> 00:17:38.130 align:middle line:84%
the mechanism that holds
this and then releases.

00:17:38.130 --> 00:17:39.680 align:middle line:84%
So that would tell
me, maybe, there's

00:17:39.680 --> 00:17:43.820 align:middle line:84%
an issue in
releasing the toxins,

00:17:43.820 --> 00:17:46.000 align:middle line:84%
releasing something
that's going on.

00:17:46.000 --> 00:17:46.800 align:middle line:90%
All right.

00:17:46.800 --> 00:17:48.470 align:middle line:84%
So this, again,
where we get more.

00:17:48.470 --> 00:17:49.887 align:middle line:84%
Now, what we want
to do, I'm going

00:17:49.887 --> 00:17:52.580 align:middle line:84%
to go ahead and jump the
process, how this works,

00:17:52.580 --> 00:17:54.210 align:middle line:84%
and why they told me
to write the book.

00:17:54.210 --> 00:17:55.945 align:middle line:84%
And I said, I had
resistance, resistance.

00:17:55.945 --> 00:17:58.070 align:middle line:84%
And they said, look, we
need you to write this book

00:17:58.070 --> 00:18:00.090 align:middle line:84%
because there's all
these other books.

00:18:00.090 --> 00:18:01.640 align:middle line:84%
And that was one
of my resistances.

00:18:01.640 --> 00:18:03.140 align:middle line:84%
Why am I writing a
book when there's

00:18:03.140 --> 00:18:05.080 align:middle line:90%
so many other books out there?

00:18:05.080 --> 00:18:05.880 align:middle line:90%
Why?

00:18:05.880 --> 00:18:07.790 align:middle line:84%
Why is there another
book needed on this?

00:18:07.790 --> 00:18:08.830 align:middle line:90%
And I don't know this.

00:18:08.830 --> 00:18:09.690 align:middle line:84%
I haven't read
these other books,

00:18:09.690 --> 00:18:11.340 align:middle line:84%
but they said there's
not a process.

00:18:11.340 --> 00:18:13.920 align:middle line:84%
And people need to
understand that they've

00:18:13.920 --> 00:18:15.840 align:middle line:84%
got to go-- you have
all the answers.

00:18:15.840 --> 00:18:16.960 align:middle line:90%
They got to connect to us.

00:18:16.960 --> 00:18:19.110 align:middle line:84%
They've got to connect to
themselves, their higher

00:18:19.110 --> 00:18:22.060 align:middle line:84%
self, and their guidance
team to get the answers.

00:18:22.060 --> 00:18:24.850 align:middle line:84%
Stop going to all these
other people, and fix me,

00:18:24.850 --> 00:18:25.870 align:middle line:90%
fix me, fix me.

00:18:25.870 --> 00:18:28.630 align:middle line:84%
You've got to take
care of yourself.

00:18:28.630 --> 00:18:30.200 align:middle line:90%
Get the answers for yourself.

00:18:30.200 --> 00:18:31.280 align:middle line:90%
This is your power.

00:18:31.280 --> 00:18:32.980 align:middle line:90%
It's taking your power back.

00:18:32.980 --> 00:18:36.770 align:middle line:84%
And so it's like you've got
to show them how to do that.

00:18:36.770 --> 00:18:37.940 align:middle line:90%
There's a process for it.

00:18:37.940 --> 00:18:40.148 align:middle line:84%
So I've been giving
some of it because just

00:18:40.148 --> 00:18:42.190 align:middle line:84%
like the body parts and
everything that gives you

00:18:42.190 --> 00:18:44.360 align:middle line:90%
clues as to what it's about.

00:18:44.360 --> 00:18:47.050 align:middle line:84%
But then you go to
your higher self.

00:18:47.050 --> 00:18:49.270 align:middle line:84%
And you get the rest
of the information.

00:18:49.270 --> 00:18:52.330 align:middle line:84%
How many of you believe that you
can tap into your higher self

00:18:52.330 --> 00:18:53.950 align:middle line:90%
and get answers?

00:18:53.950 --> 00:18:55.640 align:middle line:90%
Fantastic.

00:18:55.640 --> 00:18:57.920 align:middle line:84%
There's like half of you
are not raising your hand.

00:18:57.920 --> 00:18:59.150 align:middle line:90%
Why not?

00:18:59.150 --> 00:19:00.280 align:middle line:90%
>> Some days.

00:19:00.280 --> 00:19:02.064 align:middle line:90%
>> Some days.

00:19:02.064 --> 00:19:04.522 align:middle line:84%
>> You don't believe in the
information you're getting from

00:19:04.522 --> 00:19:07.050 align:middle line:84%
the source, instead
of [INDISTINCT].

00:19:07.050 --> 00:19:07.900 align:middle line:90%
>> Thank you.

00:19:07.900 --> 00:19:09.470 align:middle line:90%
That's a very common thing.

00:19:09.470 --> 00:19:11.220 align:middle line:84%
He says, maybe you
don't believe that it's

00:19:11.220 --> 00:19:15.075 align:middle line:84%
coming from your higher self,
your guidance team, your source.

00:19:15.075 --> 00:19:17.200 align:middle line:84%
You think it's coming from
your own conscious mind,

00:19:17.200 --> 00:19:18.390 align:middle line:90%
your wishful thinking.

00:19:18.390 --> 00:19:20.640 align:middle line:90%
How very human of you.

00:19:20.640 --> 00:19:22.840 align:middle line:90%
And I mean that in the best way.

00:19:22.840 --> 00:19:24.490 align:middle line:90%
That is the human part of us.

00:19:24.490 --> 00:19:26.430 align:middle line:90%
And that's wonderful.

00:19:26.430 --> 00:19:27.970 align:middle line:90%
That's that discernment.

00:19:27.970 --> 00:19:29.590 align:middle line:90%
I want to know this is real.

00:19:29.590 --> 00:19:31.990 align:middle line:84%
That's our conscious mind
and our human part going.

00:19:31.990 --> 00:19:33.310 align:middle line:90%
But I hear this.

00:19:33.310 --> 00:19:36.030 align:middle line:90%
But is it really them?

00:19:36.030 --> 00:19:38.140 align:middle line:90%
I went through the same thing.

00:19:38.140 --> 00:19:39.660 align:middle line:90%
And that's how I can tell you.

00:19:39.660 --> 00:19:41.320 align:middle line:90%
But don't take my word for it.

00:19:41.320 --> 00:19:42.880 align:middle line:84%
I want you to go
through your own.

00:19:42.880 --> 00:19:45.450 align:middle line:84%
And I did this little
game, because I

00:19:45.450 --> 00:19:47.110 align:middle line:90%
was like, how do I know?

00:19:47.110 --> 00:19:50.890 align:middle line:84%
How do I know it's you
not my wishful thinking?

00:19:50.890 --> 00:19:53.130 align:middle line:84%
Because what I was
hearing was nice.

00:19:53.130 --> 00:19:54.310 align:middle line:90%
It was nice.

00:19:54.310 --> 00:19:56.670 align:middle line:84%
And I'm like, this
could just be me.

00:19:56.670 --> 00:19:57.850 align:middle line:90%
And I'm just fooling myself.

00:19:57.850 --> 00:20:00.510 align:middle line:84%
Anybody-- hey, I'm just
going to be the biggest

00:20:00.510 --> 00:20:01.980 align:middle line:90%
fool because I listen to this.

00:20:01.980 --> 00:20:04.840 align:middle line:84%
And none of it's real and
stuff, and it's like--

00:20:04.840 --> 00:20:08.740 align:middle line:84%
so they're like, OK, well,
how about we do this?

00:20:08.740 --> 00:20:09.740 align:middle line:90%
Because I like games.

00:20:09.740 --> 00:20:11.080 align:middle line:90%
I like things that make--

00:20:11.080 --> 00:20:12.710 align:middle line:90%
they map things out for me.

00:20:12.710 --> 00:20:15.580 align:middle line:84%
And they said, OK, when you hear
it from us, when you hear us,

00:20:15.580 --> 00:20:16.840 align:middle line:90%
we'll come maybe over here.

00:20:16.840 --> 00:20:18.030 align:middle line:90%
And this is just my case.

00:20:18.030 --> 00:20:19.280 align:middle line:90%
It could be different for you.

00:20:19.280 --> 00:20:22.670 align:middle line:84%
But it's like, you'll
hear us over here.

00:20:22.670 --> 00:20:26.780 align:middle line:84%
When it's you and your thoughts,
how about we put it over here?

00:20:26.780 --> 00:20:29.540 align:middle line:84%
Someplace, it's really easy to
know it's not from over here,

00:20:29.540 --> 00:20:31.060 align:middle line:90%
so over here.

00:20:31.060 --> 00:20:34.530 align:middle line:84%
And there was a third one, but I
don't remember what it was now.

00:20:34.530 --> 00:20:35.550 align:middle line:90%
So I went on.

00:20:35.550 --> 00:20:37.050 align:middle line:90%
I was OK, I can work with that.

00:20:37.050 --> 00:20:37.850 align:middle line:90%
Good.

00:20:37.850 --> 00:20:38.670 align:middle line:90%
Now, I have a plan.

00:20:38.670 --> 00:20:39.140 align:middle line:90%
I can work with it.

00:20:39.140 --> 00:20:40.390 align:middle line:90%
And I will know when it's you.

00:20:40.390 --> 00:20:41.850 align:middle line:90%
And I will know when it's me.

00:20:41.850 --> 00:20:43.110 align:middle line:90%
And so we'll move forward.

00:20:43.110 --> 00:20:47.070 align:middle line:84%
And probably 98% of everything I
heard after that was coming over

00:20:47.070 --> 00:20:47.870 align:middle line:90%
here.

00:20:47.870 --> 00:20:49.680 align:middle line:84%
And I'm like, OK,
that's interesting.

00:20:49.680 --> 00:20:51.980 align:middle line:90%
I get a few over here.

00:20:51.980 --> 00:20:54.590 align:middle line:84%
Like, OK, I can
tell the difference.

00:20:54.590 --> 00:20:56.512 align:middle line:84%
I can hear there's
subtle differences.

00:20:56.512 --> 00:20:58.970 align:middle line:84%
I can hear when the conscious
mind is doing its thing, when

00:20:58.970 --> 00:21:00.775 align:middle line:90%
it's coming through like that.

00:21:00.775 --> 00:21:02.600 align:middle line:84%
What that was doing
was helping me

00:21:02.600 --> 00:21:05.000 align:middle line:84%
to understand, to
know the difference

00:21:05.000 --> 00:21:06.378 align:middle line:90%
and to start trusting.

00:21:06.378 --> 00:21:08.420 align:middle line:84%
The other thing that
allowed me to start trusting

00:21:08.420 --> 00:21:09.900 align:middle line:84%
is what information
I was getting.

00:21:09.900 --> 00:21:11.660 align:middle line:90%
I would get confirmations.

00:21:11.660 --> 00:21:15.230 align:middle line:84%
I tended to get three
confirmations in a 24-hour

00:21:15.230 --> 00:21:16.670 align:middle line:90%
period.

00:21:16.670 --> 00:21:18.587 align:middle line:84%
Somehow, it might be
somebody coming up to me.

00:21:18.587 --> 00:21:20.545 align:middle line:84%
Remember, those messages
we were talking about,

00:21:20.545 --> 00:21:21.390 align:middle line:90%
how they talk to us.

00:21:21.390 --> 00:21:22.835 align:middle line:90%
It would be some way.

00:21:22.835 --> 00:21:23.710 align:middle line:90%
It might be a person.

00:21:23.710 --> 00:21:26.050 align:middle line:84%
It might be something, a
billboard, somebody talk to me,

00:21:26.050 --> 00:21:27.180 align:middle line:90%
whatever, anything.

00:21:27.180 --> 00:21:28.030 align:middle line:90%
It comes up.

00:21:28.030 --> 00:21:31.500 align:middle line:84%
And it might say, verbatim,
the very same thing that I got.

00:21:31.500 --> 00:21:33.270 align:middle line:90%
I'm like, oh, my gosh.

00:21:33.270 --> 00:21:35.050 align:middle line:90%
That's what I heard.

00:21:35.050 --> 00:21:37.450 align:middle line:84%
See, that's me
acknowledging now.

00:21:37.450 --> 00:21:40.880 align:middle line:90%
And that was building the trust.

00:21:40.880 --> 00:21:42.407 align:middle line:90%
And that's what it's all about.

00:21:42.407 --> 00:21:43.990 align:middle line:84%
Then you're trusting
your information.

00:21:43.990 --> 00:21:45.032 align:middle line:90%
You're trusting yourself.

00:21:45.032 --> 00:21:47.080 align:middle line:90%
You're trusting your source.

00:21:47.080 --> 00:21:48.230 align:middle line:90%
That's what it's all about.

00:21:48.230 --> 00:21:49.730 align:middle line:84%
And that's why I
encourage you to go

00:21:49.730 --> 00:21:52.060 align:middle line:84%
through that
discernment process.

00:21:52.060 --> 00:21:53.780 align:middle line:90%
I encourage you to question it.

00:21:53.780 --> 00:21:56.560 align:middle line:84%
Don't question it to the
point that you stop it.

00:21:56.560 --> 00:21:59.840 align:middle line:84%
Just work with it so
that you can trust it.

00:21:59.840 --> 00:22:01.840 align:middle line:84%
Because once you
trust it, now, you

00:22:01.840 --> 00:22:03.620 align:middle line:90%
have the full on conversations.

00:22:03.620 --> 00:22:05.830 align:middle line:84%
The one thing I said
at the beginning that

00:22:05.830 --> 00:22:09.610 align:middle line:84%
it's for everyone, if you don't
believe you have an ability--

00:22:09.610 --> 00:22:11.980 align:middle line:84%
this one I can
guarantee you have--

00:22:11.980 --> 00:22:14.080 align:middle line:84%
anybody get those
things called chicken--

00:22:14.080 --> 00:22:16.830 align:middle line:90%


00:22:16.830 --> 00:22:17.630 align:middle line:90%
I just went blank.

00:22:17.630 --> 00:22:18.230 align:middle line:90%
What is it?

00:22:18.230 --> 00:22:18.760 align:middle line:90%
Goosebumps.

00:22:18.760 --> 00:22:19.660 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:22:19.660 --> 00:22:22.010 align:middle line:84%
In some countries, they
call it chicken flesh.

00:22:22.010 --> 00:22:23.600 align:middle line:90%
So I went to chicken.

00:22:23.600 --> 00:22:24.620 align:middle line:90%
It's not chicken pox.

00:22:24.620 --> 00:22:26.860 align:middle line:90%
It's chicken flesh, goosebumps.

00:22:26.860 --> 00:22:28.240 align:middle line:90%
You know what I'm talking about?

00:22:28.240 --> 00:22:29.280 align:middle line:90%
Those-- Yeah.

00:22:29.280 --> 00:22:30.080 align:middle line:90%
The chills.

00:22:30.080 --> 00:22:31.190 align:middle line:84%
And you go, all of a
sudden, it's like, whoa.

00:22:31.190 --> 00:22:34.040 align:middle line:84%
And the skin just stands up
and the hair and everything.

00:22:34.040 --> 00:22:36.550 align:middle line:84%
It means, whatever
you just heard

00:22:36.550 --> 00:22:41.398 align:middle line:84%
or whatever you
just said is truth.

00:22:41.398 --> 00:22:43.190 align:middle line:84%
And that's why I call
them the truth bumps.

00:22:43.190 --> 00:22:44.560 align:middle line:84%
And that's why I said
earlier, I was getting them

00:22:44.560 --> 00:22:46.270 align:middle line:84%
all the way up my legs when
I was saying something,

00:22:46.270 --> 00:22:47.530 align:middle line:84%
I was like, yeah,
it's like, well, yeah,

00:22:47.530 --> 00:22:48.988 align:middle line:84%
you're really on
to something here.

00:22:48.988 --> 00:22:50.480 align:middle line:90%
So pay attention to that.

00:22:50.480 --> 00:22:51.770 align:middle line:90%
That's really cool.

00:22:51.770 --> 00:22:54.230 align:middle line:84%
When you get it, it's
like, what was just said?

00:22:54.230 --> 00:22:55.480 align:middle line:90%
What did I just say, whatever?

00:22:55.480 --> 00:22:57.420 align:middle line:90%
It was truth.

00:22:57.420 --> 00:22:59.170 align:middle line:84%
So that way, you know,
because some people

00:22:59.170 --> 00:23:00.910 align:middle line:90%
say I don't have any abilities.

00:23:00.910 --> 00:23:02.090 align:middle line:90%
Somebody needs to know this.

00:23:02.090 --> 00:23:03.820 align:middle line:90%
I don't have any abilities.

00:23:03.820 --> 00:23:05.210 align:middle line:90%
Tracy has them all.

00:23:05.210 --> 00:23:08.440 align:middle line:90%
She took them all.

00:23:08.440 --> 00:23:09.630 align:middle line:90%
She can see.

00:23:09.630 --> 00:23:10.430 align:middle line:90%
She can hear.

00:23:10.430 --> 00:23:11.263 align:middle line:90%
She can do all this.

00:23:11.263 --> 00:23:13.990 align:middle line:90%
But I don't have any, nothing.

00:23:13.990 --> 00:23:15.280 align:middle line:90%
It didn't happen to me.

00:23:15.280 --> 00:23:16.250 align:middle line:90%
I guarantee you.

00:23:16.250 --> 00:23:19.360 align:middle line:84%
And I used to ask, in fact,
if I do, how many of you

00:23:19.360 --> 00:23:23.010 align:middle line:84%
have abilities
that have come in?

00:23:23.010 --> 00:23:27.630 align:middle line:90%
See, it's like 70% of the room.

00:23:27.630 --> 00:23:28.957 align:middle line:90%
And it used to be 50%.

00:23:28.957 --> 00:23:30.040 align:middle line:90%
And I used to accept that.

00:23:30.040 --> 00:23:33.120 align:middle line:84%
I don't accept
less than 100% now,

00:23:33.120 --> 00:23:34.770 align:middle line:90%
because we all have abilities.

00:23:34.770 --> 00:23:38.980 align:middle line:84%
You all have whatever that
was, I forgot it again.

00:23:38.980 --> 00:23:39.780 align:middle line:90%
Goosebumps.

00:23:39.780 --> 00:23:41.020 align:middle line:90%
We all get goosebumps.

00:23:41.020 --> 00:23:43.650 align:middle line:90%
So at least you have that one.

00:23:43.650 --> 00:23:47.070 align:middle line:84%
Where do we get caught up is
that we think it has to look

00:23:47.070 --> 00:23:48.900 align:middle line:90%
like somebody else's.

00:23:48.900 --> 00:23:51.120 align:middle line:84%
But I don't see
things like you see.

00:23:51.120 --> 00:23:52.300 align:middle line:90%
I don't see auras.

00:23:52.300 --> 00:23:53.100 align:middle line:90%
I don't see--

00:23:53.100 --> 00:23:54.960 align:middle line:90%
I don't have any abilities.

00:23:54.960 --> 00:23:56.040 align:middle line:90%
I don't hear.

00:23:56.040 --> 00:23:57.930 align:middle line:90%
I don't talk light language.

00:23:57.930 --> 00:23:59.560 align:middle line:90%
So I don't have any abilities.

00:23:59.560 --> 00:24:00.850 align:middle line:90%
I can't do that.

00:24:00.850 --> 00:24:02.700 align:middle line:90%
I can't-- that's not, no--

00:24:02.700 --> 00:24:05.320 align:middle line:90%
you have your own.

00:24:05.320 --> 00:24:08.440 align:middle line:84%
And that's where this-- as
you keep opening and allowing,

00:24:08.440 --> 00:24:11.020 align:middle line:90%
you will see what you do have.

00:24:11.020 --> 00:24:13.870 align:middle line:90%
I can see-- I have get visuals.

00:24:13.870 --> 00:24:17.290 align:middle line:84%
I can see-- I don't see
energy, but I can feel energy.

00:24:17.290 --> 00:24:19.552 align:middle line:90%
And I hear.

00:24:19.552 --> 00:24:21.010 align:middle line:84%
There's probably
others there, too.

00:24:21.010 --> 00:24:21.810 align:middle line:90%
I'm open.

00:24:21.810 --> 00:24:24.670 align:middle line:84%
I'm always open to receiving
more, but that's it.

00:24:24.670 --> 00:24:26.680 align:middle line:84%
As you start noticing
things happen,

00:24:26.680 --> 00:24:28.760 align:middle line:84%
and if it starts with
the goosebumps, great.

00:24:28.760 --> 00:24:29.560 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:24:29.560 --> 00:24:30.590 align:middle line:90%
That's wonderful.

00:24:30.590 --> 00:24:31.390 align:middle line:90%
What now?

00:24:31.390 --> 00:24:32.190 align:middle line:90%
What next?

00:24:32.190 --> 00:24:35.790 align:middle line:84%
Be open to however else
they can come to you.

00:24:35.790 --> 00:24:36.910 align:middle line:90%
Allow it.

00:24:36.910 --> 00:24:38.490 align:middle line:90%
And that's that trust.

00:24:38.490 --> 00:24:41.168 align:middle line:84%
See, just understand
the conscious mind

00:24:41.168 --> 00:24:42.210 align:middle line:90%
is trying to protect you.

00:24:42.210 --> 00:24:44.085 align:middle line:84%
And that's why it's
questioning all the time.

00:24:44.085 --> 00:24:46.930 align:middle line:84%
But if you'll play games, it's
like, well, let's just try this.

00:24:46.930 --> 00:24:48.670 align:middle line:90%
Then, it will work with you.

00:24:48.670 --> 00:24:51.720 align:middle line:84%
The conscious mind-- the goal
here is for the conscious mind

00:24:51.720 --> 00:24:54.840 align:middle line:84%
to cooperate with that
higher part of ourselves.

00:24:54.840 --> 00:24:57.000 align:middle line:90%
And it will do it beautifully.

00:24:57.000 --> 00:25:00.962 align:middle line:84%
When mom was doing her
earlier work, she--

00:25:00.962 --> 00:25:02.170 align:middle line:90%
people went off the deep end.

00:25:02.170 --> 00:25:06.560 align:middle line:84%
They were completely
unconscious essentially.

00:25:06.560 --> 00:25:08.100 align:middle line:90%
They call it the amnesiac state.

00:25:08.100 --> 00:25:09.540 align:middle line:90%
They didn't know what happened.

00:25:09.540 --> 00:25:13.310 align:middle line:84%
And what we have in information
now through sessions

00:25:13.310 --> 00:25:16.430 align:middle line:84%
is that the conscious
mind, at that time,

00:25:16.430 --> 00:25:18.210 align:middle line:84%
could not handle
this information.

00:25:18.210 --> 00:25:20.890 align:middle line:84%
That's why they had
to put it to sleep.

00:25:20.890 --> 00:25:22.420 align:middle line:84%
Conscious mind
now, would you say

00:25:22.420 --> 00:25:24.400 align:middle line:84%
that you can handle
concepts that we could not

00:25:24.400 --> 00:25:26.980 align:middle line:90%
handle 10, 15, 20 years ago?

00:25:26.980 --> 00:25:28.210 align:middle line:90%
Hell, yeah.

00:25:28.210 --> 00:25:29.688 align:middle line:84%
There's stuff--
simultaneous time,

00:25:29.688 --> 00:25:30.980 align:middle line:90%
I can even understand that now.

00:25:30.980 --> 00:25:32.500 align:middle line:84%
And I can draw a
picture about it.

00:25:32.500 --> 00:25:34.570 align:middle line:84%
That was like, oh,
my god, my head

00:25:34.570 --> 00:25:37.510 align:middle line:84%
hurt every time somebody
talked about that before.

00:25:37.510 --> 00:25:42.050 align:middle line:84%
Let's say 15 years ago,
my head hurt so bad.

00:25:42.050 --> 00:25:44.560 align:middle line:90%
And now, I can understand it.

00:25:44.560 --> 00:25:47.330 align:middle line:90%
See, that's how we have grown.

00:25:47.330 --> 00:25:50.390 align:middle line:84%
We have all this DNA, all these
things that we've been doing.

00:25:50.390 --> 00:25:53.420 align:middle line:84%
We are growing and excelling
and accelerating and evolving.

00:25:53.420 --> 00:25:56.840 align:middle line:84%
That's allowing us to understand
things that we couldn't before.

00:25:56.840 --> 00:25:59.840 align:middle line:84%
So now, that's why they
want us to be aware.

00:25:59.840 --> 00:26:02.360 align:middle line:84%
They want us to
communicate and cooperate.

00:26:02.360 --> 00:26:04.690 align:middle line:84%
They want that conscious
mind cooperation.

00:26:04.690 --> 00:26:09.340 align:middle line:84%
So it's allowed to be party
to this information now.

00:26:09.340 --> 00:26:11.500 align:middle line:90%
They want it that way.

00:26:11.500 --> 00:26:15.160 align:middle line:84%
So if practitioners
and clients--

00:26:15.160 --> 00:26:18.400 align:middle line:84%
anybody out there--
QHHD, if you remember,

00:26:18.400 --> 00:26:20.760 align:middle line:84%
if you were aware of what
was going on, it's OK.

00:26:20.760 --> 00:26:22.520 align:middle line:84%
I don't mean to go
into QHHD right now,

00:26:22.520 --> 00:26:23.750 align:middle line:84%
but I just want you to
know because somebody

00:26:23.750 --> 00:26:24.750 align:middle line:90%
needs to know this.

00:26:24.750 --> 00:26:25.957 align:middle line:90%
It's OK.

00:26:25.957 --> 00:26:26.790 align:middle line:90%
That's where we are.

00:26:26.790 --> 00:26:29.600 align:middle line:84%
We want the conscious mind
to be aware, as long as it

00:26:29.600 --> 00:26:32.220 align:middle line:90%
doesn't shut the thing down.

00:26:32.220 --> 00:26:34.220 align:middle line:84%
Because you notice, if
you ask enough questions,

00:26:34.220 --> 00:26:35.580 align:middle line:84%
your conscious mind is
trying to come in there.

00:26:35.580 --> 00:26:36.840 align:middle line:90%
It's like, no, no, no, no, no.

00:26:36.840 --> 00:26:38.090 align:middle line:84%
We're doing that in
the waking state.

00:26:38.090 --> 00:26:39.548 align:middle line:84%
By you asking those
questions, see,

00:26:39.548 --> 00:26:42.685 align:middle line:84%
by me saying, OK, you can
do it this way, yes, I can.

00:26:42.685 --> 00:26:44.060 align:middle line:84%
Otherwise, the
conscious mind was

00:26:44.060 --> 00:26:45.950 align:middle line:84%
going to shut anything
down because it

00:26:45.950 --> 00:26:47.112 align:middle line:90%
doesn't understand it.

00:26:47.112 --> 00:26:48.570 align:middle line:84%
And I don't know
what you're doing.

00:26:48.570 --> 00:26:49.670 align:middle line:90%
I don't know what this is.

00:26:49.670 --> 00:26:52.070 align:middle line:90%
And I got to protect you.

00:26:52.070 --> 00:26:54.140 align:middle line:90%
So that's how it's been working.

00:26:54.140 --> 00:26:56.490 align:middle line:84%
Each one of us, we
are here for a reason.

00:26:56.490 --> 00:26:57.660 align:middle line:90%
You are here for a reason.

00:26:57.660 --> 00:26:59.540 align:middle line:90%
You have a role to play.

00:26:59.540 --> 00:27:02.490 align:middle line:84%
You are a vital
piece to this puzzle.

00:27:02.490 --> 00:27:05.850 align:middle line:84%
Without your piece, it
is not the same puzzle.

00:27:05.850 --> 00:27:08.360 align:middle line:84%
It will not be the
same beautiful picture

00:27:08.360 --> 00:27:11.580 align:middle line:84%
that it is, the same
scene that we have.

00:27:11.580 --> 00:27:13.350 align:middle line:90%
You are necessary.

00:27:13.350 --> 00:27:14.990 align:middle line:90%
You are vital.

00:27:14.990 --> 00:27:17.300 align:middle line:90%
You need to be here.

00:27:17.300 --> 00:27:20.430 align:middle line:90%
So be here.

00:27:20.430 --> 00:27:21.840 align:middle line:90%
Your body might be here.

00:27:21.840 --> 00:27:24.750 align:middle line:84%
But if your mind and everything
else is trying to escape,

00:27:24.750 --> 00:27:27.270 align:middle line:84%
and you're off in other
worlds, and you don't--

00:27:27.270 --> 00:27:30.560 align:middle line:84%
you're not fully
interacting, you're not here.

00:27:30.560 --> 00:27:32.970 align:middle line:90%
They want you to be present.

00:27:32.970 --> 00:27:35.780 align:middle line:90%
You came here for a reason.

00:27:35.780 --> 00:27:37.620 align:middle line:90%
Be here.

00:27:37.620 --> 00:27:39.120 align:middle line:90%
Serve your purpose.

00:27:39.120 --> 00:27:41.880 align:middle line:84%
Be what you came
here to be and do,

00:27:41.880 --> 00:27:43.940 align:middle line:90%
emanate your beautiful energy.

00:27:43.940 --> 00:27:46.050 align:middle line:84%
When we go off and
we're escaping,

00:27:46.050 --> 00:27:48.440 align:middle line:84%
that's because we're
thinking about the past,

00:27:48.440 --> 00:27:50.240 align:middle line:90%
or we're into the future.

00:27:50.240 --> 00:27:53.390 align:middle line:84%
We're in timelines that
we have no control over.

00:27:53.390 --> 00:27:55.890 align:middle line:84%
All we have control over
is this present moment.

00:27:55.890 --> 00:27:58.230 align:middle line:84%
So you keep pulling yourself
to this present moment.

00:27:58.230 --> 00:28:01.850 align:middle line:84%
And it might be a matter
of conditioning and working

00:28:01.850 --> 00:28:02.870 align:middle line:90%
with yourself.
