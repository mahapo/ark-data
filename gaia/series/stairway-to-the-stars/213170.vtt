>> I want to talk about this
aspect of the situation,

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:20.400 align:middle line:10%
the UAP, or UFOs, as I still
often like to call them.

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:22.860 align:middle line:10%
Ask yourself a question.

00:00:22.860 --> 00:00:27.240 align:middle line:84%
Why did it take till 1947
for us to start having

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:28.445 align:middle line:90%
a conversation about this?

00:00:28.445 --> 00:00:31.250 align:middle line:90%


00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:33.390 align:middle line:84%
You frequently hear--
I frequently hear,

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:37.310 align:middle line:84%
and I'm sure you do, people,
commentators, very smart people

00:00:37.310 --> 00:00:40.820 align:middle line:84%
often say something like,
they've been here forever.

00:00:40.820 --> 00:00:42.370 align:middle line:90%
It's like an axiom.

00:00:42.370 --> 00:00:44.270 align:middle line:10%
They've been here forever.

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:46.400 align:middle line:10%
And I'm kind of like, yeah.

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:50.630 align:middle line:10%
But I'm kind of like, who's the
they that you're talking about?

00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:51.500 align:middle line:10%
The Grey aliens?

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:52.790 align:middle line:10%
The reptilians?

00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:56.020 align:middle line:10%
The nice-looking
humans with the robes?

00:00:56.020 --> 00:00:59.480 align:middle line:10%
Which group has
been here forever?

00:00:59.480 --> 00:01:04.129 align:middle line:10%
Because it's kind of a sloppy,
lazy formulation when you really

00:01:04.129 --> 00:01:05.620 align:middle line:10%
think about it.

00:01:05.620 --> 00:01:06.500 align:middle line:10%
Who's the they?

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:08.210 align:middle line:10%
And have they really
been here forever?

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:10.510 align:middle line:10%
Have they really
been here forever

00:01:10.510 --> 00:01:12.562 align:middle line:10%
in the way that they are now?

00:01:12.562 --> 00:01:14.770 align:middle line:10%
I'm going to give you the
short answer, which is, no.

00:01:14.770 --> 00:01:15.740 align:middle line:10%
They haven't.

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:17.270 align:middle line:10%
Not the way they are today.

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:19.660 align:middle line:10%
It's not the same.

00:01:19.660 --> 00:01:23.550 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to say this because
I think I'm in a position where

00:01:23.550 --> 00:01:24.350 align:middle line:90%
I can say this.

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:26.650 align:middle line:84%
I have studied
thousands upon thousands

00:01:26.650 --> 00:01:29.190 align:middle line:90%
of UFO reports and stories.

00:01:29.190 --> 00:01:32.770 align:middle line:10%
I'm a huge fan of the book by
Chris Aubeck and Jacques VallÃ©e,

00:01:32.770 --> 00:01:33.865 align:middle line:10%
"Wonders in the Sky."

00:01:33.865 --> 00:01:34.990 align:middle line:10%
Highly recommend this book.

00:01:34.990 --> 00:01:36.130 align:middle line:10%
It's an outstanding book.

00:01:36.130 --> 00:01:39.490 align:middle line:10%
What they did, of
course, is they gathered,

00:01:39.490 --> 00:01:42.940 align:middle line:10%
I would guess I would say
all of the ancient UFO-type,

00:01:42.940 --> 00:01:46.090 align:middle line:10%
alien-type stories
that they could find.

00:01:46.090 --> 00:01:49.990 align:middle line:10%
They both had, I think, a
very good scholarly approach

00:01:49.990 --> 00:01:51.740 align:middle line:10%
to the subject.

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:55.060 align:middle line:10%
And they put together a
really good-- a great book.

00:01:55.060 --> 00:01:59.350 align:middle line:10%
It's some of my favorite
nighttime reading, to be honest.

00:01:59.350 --> 00:02:02.300 align:middle line:84%
I often go into that
book just for fun.

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:03.300 align:middle line:90%
I've read it many times.

00:02:03.300 --> 00:02:05.940 align:middle line:90%


00:02:05.940 --> 00:02:08.009 align:middle line:84%
But I will also say
a lot of those cases

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:10.630 align:middle line:84%
are not persuasive
when I look at them.

00:02:10.630 --> 00:02:12.990 align:middle line:84%
And I will say
that we tend to be

00:02:12.990 --> 00:02:16.560 align:middle line:84%
very ignorant of the
historical context of most

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:17.743 align:middle line:90%
of those sightings.

00:02:17.743 --> 00:02:19.410 align:middle line:84%
And it's not anyone's
fault. Most people

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:21.330 align:middle line:90%
aren't historical experts.

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:24.310 align:middle line:10%
I'm not a historical expert,
and I'm a historical fanatic.

00:02:24.310 --> 00:02:26.880 align:middle line:10%
And I'm still-- there's
a lot that I don't know.

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:29.220 align:middle line:10%
But I will say that
when I look at a lot

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:31.200 align:middle line:10%
of those ancient
stories, they are--

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:35.040 align:middle line:10%
there's no way you're going to
convince me that most of those

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:36.460 align:middle line:10%
are actual UFOs.

00:02:36.460 --> 00:02:37.872 align:middle line:10%
Nope, not buying it.

00:02:37.872 --> 00:02:39.330 align:middle line:10%
I won't get into
the argument here,

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:41.080 align:middle line:10%
but I will just say
I've talked about this

00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:46.080 align:middle line:10%
occasionally on my website
and sometimes on YouTube.

00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:48.900 align:middle line:10%
I will suggest to you that the
reason we weren't really talking

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:52.740 align:middle line:10%
about UFOs or flying saucers
in large numbers until 1947

00:02:52.740 --> 00:02:55.890 align:middle line:10%
is because maybe they didn't
begin arriving in large numbers

00:02:55.890 --> 00:02:58.080 align:middle line:10%
until around that time.

00:02:58.080 --> 00:03:00.690 align:middle line:84%
I mean, you think
about, you know,

00:03:00.690 --> 00:03:06.720 align:middle line:84%
the United States of
post-Civil War, 1870s, 1880s.

00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:09.263 align:middle line:10%
Well, those Americans
were smart people.

00:03:09.263 --> 00:03:10.930 align:middle line:10%
They were outside way
more than we were.

00:03:10.930 --> 00:03:15.070 align:middle line:10%
There was no consciousness
of flying saucers.

00:03:15.070 --> 00:03:16.060 align:middle line:10%
There was no sightings.

00:03:16.060 --> 00:03:17.643 align:middle line:84%
Now, I know you're
going to say, well,

00:03:17.643 --> 00:03:19.230 align:middle line:84%
there was those
airships of the 1890s.

00:03:19.230 --> 00:03:21.397 align:middle line:84%
I'm not a-- I'm not a fan
of those sightings either.

00:03:21.397 --> 00:03:23.700 align:middle line:90%
I did a whole thing on that.

00:03:23.700 --> 00:03:26.460 align:middle line:10%
I do believe that there was some
very good sightings in the 19th

00:03:26.460 --> 00:03:29.970 align:middle line:10%
century, and I've included a
number of them in my USO book

00:03:29.970 --> 00:03:32.490 align:middle line:10%
that will be published in a
few months, some very good,

00:03:32.490 --> 00:03:33.980 align:middle line:10%
very good ones.

00:03:33.980 --> 00:03:36.070 align:middle line:10%
So there was a
definite phenomenon.

00:03:36.070 --> 00:03:38.460 align:middle line:10%
But the airships now,
don't get into it.

00:03:38.460 --> 00:03:40.860 align:middle line:10%
It's not a good ending.

00:03:40.860 --> 00:03:42.820 align:middle line:10%
That was a media frenzy.

00:03:42.820 --> 00:03:45.850 align:middle line:10%
And when you read the
stories in detail,

00:03:45.850 --> 00:03:49.030 align:middle line:10%
you will actually see
what I'm talking about.

00:03:49.030 --> 00:03:52.780 align:middle line:10%
In fact, no one at the
time remembered it after--

00:03:52.780 --> 00:03:55.240 align:middle line:10%
you know, two months after
the whole media frenzy ended,

00:03:55.240 --> 00:03:57.070 align:middle line:10%
because it really--

00:03:57.070 --> 00:03:59.520 align:middle line:10%
it didn't-- it wasn't--
it didn't happen.

00:03:59.520 --> 00:04:01.690 align:middle line:10%
That's why.

00:04:01.690 --> 00:04:03.450 align:middle line:10%
Now, other sightings did.

00:04:03.450 --> 00:04:05.240 align:middle line:10%
So it wasn't that
there was nothing.

00:04:05.240 --> 00:04:09.940 align:middle line:10%
But my point is that the
numbers that we have--

00:04:09.940 --> 00:04:13.470 align:middle line:10%
for example, I'm a big fan
of the National UFO Reporting

00:04:13.470 --> 00:04:14.270 align:middle line:10%
Center.

00:04:14.270 --> 00:04:16.870 align:middle line:10%
I go there almost all the time.

00:04:16.870 --> 00:04:19.930 align:middle line:10%
I'm very fond of Peter
Davenport, who runs that site,

00:04:19.930 --> 00:04:21.470 align:middle line:10%
and I've talked
with him for years.

00:04:21.470 --> 00:04:26.480 align:middle line:10%
And these are the statistics
of the last five, six years.

00:04:26.480 --> 00:04:29.290 align:middle line:10%
And you're talking basically
5,000 sightings on that website

00:04:29.290 --> 00:04:30.310 align:middle line:10%
every single year.

00:04:30.310 --> 00:04:32.140 align:middle line:10%
Every year, 5,000.

00:04:32.140 --> 00:04:34.970 align:middle line:10%
Now, I'm not saying every one
of them is a legit alien craft.

00:04:34.970 --> 00:04:36.190 align:middle line:10%
Of course not.

00:04:36.190 --> 00:04:38.540 align:middle line:90%
But I'll tell you this.

00:04:38.540 --> 00:04:41.380 align:middle line:84%
Go through that
website sometime.

00:04:41.380 --> 00:04:43.130 align:middle line:90%
I have a little test.

00:04:43.130 --> 00:04:44.750 align:middle line:90%
I call it the wow test.

00:04:44.750 --> 00:04:47.200 align:middle line:10%
And that is when I read a
report, if it makes me say,

00:04:47.200 --> 00:04:49.390 align:middle line:10%
wow, I think,
that's pretty good.

00:04:49.390 --> 00:04:52.930 align:middle line:10%
At least 1 out of 10 sightings
there make me say, wow.

00:04:52.930 --> 00:04:54.920 align:middle line:10%
They're actually that good.

00:04:54.920 --> 00:04:57.560 align:middle line:10%
And actually, much
more than that.

00:04:57.560 --> 00:04:59.350 align:middle line:10%
But I'm being conservative here.

00:04:59.350 --> 00:05:02.050 align:middle line:10%
And then you got
the MUFON database,

00:05:02.050 --> 00:05:05.710 align:middle line:10%
which gets about just as
many sightings as NUFORC,

00:05:05.710 --> 00:05:06.980 align:middle line:10%
about 5,000 a year.

00:05:06.980 --> 00:05:09.880 align:middle line:10%
Then you get some other
sources in North America.

00:05:09.880 --> 00:05:13.220 align:middle line:10%
Chris Rutkowski, up in Manitoba,
collects Canadian cases.

00:05:13.220 --> 00:05:15.190 align:middle line:10%
He gets about 2,000 a year.

00:05:15.190 --> 00:05:18.860 align:middle line:10%
So those three alone, you've got
about 12,000 or more every year.

00:05:18.860 --> 00:05:22.390 align:middle line:10%
I don't know how much overlap,
but I don't think too much.

00:05:22.390 --> 00:05:27.940 align:middle line:10%
So-- and I will point out that
the majority, the vast majority

00:05:27.940 --> 00:05:30.700 align:middle line:10%
of cases in those three
databases are basically US

00:05:30.700 --> 00:05:32.280 align:middle line:10%
and Canada, North America.

00:05:32.280 --> 00:05:35.080 align:middle line:84%
Yes, there's an
international component.

00:05:35.080 --> 00:05:37.450 align:middle line:84%
But most people in
Indonesia, they're

00:05:37.450 --> 00:05:40.260 align:middle line:84%
not going to think to write
to the National UFO Reporting.

00:05:40.260 --> 00:05:41.510 align:middle line:90%
It's just not going to happen.

00:05:41.510 --> 00:05:47.100 align:middle line:84%
So that pie chart on
your right, that arrow

00:05:47.100 --> 00:05:50.070 align:middle line:84%
is pointing at the United States
in terms of global population

00:05:50.070 --> 00:05:50.870 align:middle line:90%
there.

00:05:50.870 --> 00:05:53.970 align:middle line:84%
So the US has just a little over
4% of the world's population.

00:05:53.970 --> 00:05:56.140 align:middle line:84%
Canada is not even on there,
because it's so small.

00:05:56.140 --> 00:05:58.560 align:middle line:10%
So the US and Canada
are less than 5%

00:05:58.560 --> 00:06:01.710 align:middle line:10%
of the world's population, and
yet they're getting, let's say,

00:06:01.710 --> 00:06:04.270 align:middle line:10%
10,000 sightings a year.

00:06:04.270 --> 00:06:08.760 align:middle line:10%
10,000 in the US
and Canada alone.

00:06:08.760 --> 00:06:13.680 align:middle line:84%
Now, those are raw reports, but
there's a whole world out there

00:06:13.680 --> 00:06:16.830 align:middle line:84%
that doesn't have anywhere
near as good at reporting

00:06:16.830 --> 00:06:19.493 align:middle line:90%
infrastructure as what we have.

00:06:19.493 --> 00:06:21.910 align:middle line:84%
Though do you think those
signings aren't happening there?

00:06:21.910 --> 00:06:25.493 align:middle line:84%
So I put my little math
equation here together.

00:06:25.493 --> 00:06:26.910 align:middle line:84%
And I'm just going
to run this by.

00:06:26.910 --> 00:06:28.452 align:middle line:10%
You have a rough
estimate, let's say,

00:06:28.452 --> 00:06:33.700 align:middle line:10%
of 10,000 UFO reports in
North America every year,

00:06:33.700 --> 00:06:35.650 align:middle line:10%
which is quite a lot.

00:06:35.650 --> 00:06:37.180 align:middle line:10%
I think that's about right.

00:06:37.180 --> 00:06:41.560 align:middle line:10%
So let's take 5%, 1
out of 20, that we will

00:06:41.560 --> 00:06:43.370 align:middle line:10%
judge to be of high interest.

00:06:43.370 --> 00:06:44.945 align:middle line:10%
I think that's a low number.

00:06:44.945 --> 00:06:46.570 align:middle line:10%
I know there are some
investigators who

00:06:46.570 --> 00:06:47.987 align:middle line:10%
think that's too
high, but I think

00:06:47.987 --> 00:06:53.410 align:middle line:10%
most would probably agree
that it's quite conservative.

00:06:53.410 --> 00:06:57.512 align:middle line:10%
So that would give you 500
good UFO reports every year

00:06:57.512 --> 00:06:59.470 align:middle line:10%
in North America, which
is more than one a day,

00:06:59.470 --> 00:07:01.920 align:middle line:10%
which is, you know, pretty
good when you think about it.

00:07:01.920 --> 00:07:02.720 align:middle line:10%
It's a lot.

00:07:02.720 --> 00:07:05.650 align:middle line:10%
But then you have to ask,
what percentage of sightings

00:07:05.650 --> 00:07:08.650 align:middle line:10%
are reported by witnesses?

00:07:08.650 --> 00:07:11.920 align:middle line:10%
You know, how many are we
actually getting recorded?

00:07:11.920 --> 00:07:14.520 align:middle line:10%
I'm not going to ask, because
I can't see any of you because

00:07:14.520 --> 00:07:15.320 align:middle line:10%
of the lighting.

00:07:15.320 --> 00:07:18.040 align:middle line:10%
But I'm just going
to take a wild guess

00:07:18.040 --> 00:07:19.710 align:middle line:10%
that probably many of you--

00:07:19.710 --> 00:07:19.940 align:middle line:10%
All right.

00:07:19.940 --> 00:07:20.350 align:middle line:10%
Let's do it.

00:07:20.350 --> 00:07:21.650 align:middle line:10%
So how many of you
have seen a UFO?

00:07:21.650 --> 00:07:22.250 align:middle line:90%
Could you raise your hand?

00:07:22.250 --> 00:07:23.000 align:middle line:90%
I'm going to look.

00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:23.750 align:middle line:90%
Keep the hands up.

00:07:23.750 --> 00:07:24.550 align:middle line:90%
I'm looking.

00:07:24.550 --> 00:07:27.790 align:middle line:84%
It looks like-- all right,
now keep your hand up

00:07:27.790 --> 00:07:30.213 align:middle line:84%
if you've reported
it to any place.

00:07:30.213 --> 00:07:32.740 align:middle line:90%


00:07:32.740 --> 00:07:34.060 align:middle line:90%
One.

00:07:34.060 --> 00:07:35.370 align:middle line:90%
Practically none.

00:07:35.370 --> 00:07:36.170 align:middle line:90%
A couple.

00:07:36.170 --> 00:07:37.210 align:middle line:90%
One over there.

00:07:37.210 --> 00:07:39.195 align:middle line:90%
And think about this.

00:07:39.195 --> 00:07:41.980 align:middle line:90%


00:07:41.980 --> 00:07:43.550 align:middle line:90%
We're all motivated.

00:07:43.550 --> 00:07:46.180 align:middle line:90%
I mean, we're into this.

00:07:46.180 --> 00:07:50.500 align:middle line:10%
You flew or drove here to
be here, to listen to me

00:07:50.500 --> 00:07:51.680 align:middle line:10%
talk about this.

00:07:51.680 --> 00:07:54.820 align:middle line:10%
And by the way, I'm one of the
people who saw one and didn't

00:07:54.820 --> 00:07:56.860 align:middle line:10%
report, so I'm part of that.

00:07:56.860 --> 00:07:57.900 align:middle line:10%
I didn't report.

00:07:57.900 --> 00:07:58.700 align:middle line:10%
I should.

00:07:58.700 --> 00:07:59.500 align:middle line:10%
I really ought to.

00:07:59.500 --> 00:08:01.010 align:middle line:10%
I'll get around to it.

00:08:01.010 --> 00:08:02.890 align:middle line:10%
And I haven't
gotten around to it.

00:08:02.890 --> 00:08:08.680 align:middle line:10%
So my point is that
there's much more than even

00:08:08.680 --> 00:08:09.530 align:middle line:10%
what we're seeing.

00:08:09.530 --> 00:08:12.792 align:middle line:90%


00:08:12.792 --> 00:08:15.120 align:middle line:10%
But we're going to say--

00:08:15.120 --> 00:08:19.020 align:middle line:10%
so what's-- I say, well, let's
say as many as one out of four

00:08:19.020 --> 00:08:21.153 align:middle line:10%
report, which is
ridiculously high.

00:08:21.153 --> 00:08:22.570 align:middle line:10%
But I'm trying to
be conservative.

00:08:22.570 --> 00:08:24.340 align:middle line:90%
I'm trying to be cautious here.

00:08:24.340 --> 00:08:26.650 align:middle line:90%
So let's say 25% report.

00:08:26.650 --> 00:08:29.950 align:middle line:10%
So that takes your 500,
now you multiply by 4,

00:08:29.950 --> 00:08:34.890 align:middle line:10%
that gives you 2,000 good
sightings, let's say,

00:08:34.890 --> 00:08:36.909 align:middle line:10%
in North America each year.

00:08:36.909 --> 00:08:38.530 align:middle line:84%
And I think it's
much more than that.

00:08:38.530 --> 00:08:40.000 align:middle line:84%
But let's say 2,000
good sightings.

00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:42.120 align:middle line:84%
Now, of course, US
and Canada, there's

00:08:42.120 --> 00:08:43.630 align:middle line:90%
5% of the world's population.

00:08:43.630 --> 00:08:47.520 align:middle line:84%
So do we think that only
the US and Canada are

00:08:47.520 --> 00:08:49.440 align:middle line:90%
getting all the UFO reports?

00:08:49.440 --> 00:08:53.550 align:middle line:10%
Or should we make an assumption
that this might be distributed

00:08:53.550 --> 00:08:54.760 align:middle line:10%
more evenly around the world?

00:08:54.760 --> 00:08:57.720 align:middle line:10%
And I'm going to definitely say
the latter, because in my USO

00:08:57.720 --> 00:09:02.100 align:middle line:10%
studies, it is
absolutely worldwide.

00:09:02.100 --> 00:09:05.960 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely worldwide.

00:09:05.960 --> 00:09:10.277 align:middle line:10%
So then let's multiply by 20,
I mean, to get a rough estimate

00:09:10.277 --> 00:09:11.360 align:middle line:10%
for the rest of the world.

00:09:11.360 --> 00:09:16.300 align:middle line:84%
Now you're looking at 40,000
good UFO sightings worldwide

00:09:16.300 --> 00:09:17.100 align:middle line:90%
each year.

00:09:17.100 --> 00:09:21.770 align:middle line:84%
But it doesn't even end there,
because that's more than 100

00:09:21.770 --> 00:09:22.750 align:middle line:90%
a day.

00:09:22.750 --> 00:09:26.340 align:middle line:84%
But how many of these
are never seen at all?

00:09:26.340 --> 00:09:28.970 align:middle line:84%
And I realize this is not
an easy thing to get into.

00:09:28.970 --> 00:09:30.570 align:middle line:84%
How do you make
such an argument?

00:09:30.570 --> 00:09:31.590 align:middle line:90%
But let's just face it.

00:09:31.590 --> 00:09:34.400 align:middle line:84%
You think about a UFO
report or sighting, rather.

00:09:34.400 --> 00:09:35.490 align:middle line:90%
They're furtive.

00:09:35.490 --> 00:09:36.900 align:middle line:90%
They're quick.

00:09:36.900 --> 00:09:38.950 align:middle line:10%
They're-- you almost
missed it, right?

00:09:38.950 --> 00:09:41.010 align:middle line:10%
Most of them are like that.

00:09:41.010 --> 00:09:44.310 align:middle line:10%
It's very easy to miss
the sight like that.

00:09:44.310 --> 00:09:46.430 align:middle line:10%
2:00 in the morning, 3:00
in the morning, like--

00:09:46.430 --> 00:09:49.250 align:middle line:10%
normally you're sleeping,
but this time you caught one.

00:09:49.250 --> 00:09:52.460 align:middle line:10%
There-- And so you
have to assume,

00:09:52.460 --> 00:09:56.470 align:middle line:10%
one has to assume there's a
lot more than what we're even

00:09:56.470 --> 00:09:57.270 align:middle line:10%
seeing.

00:09:57.270 --> 00:09:59.780 align:middle line:10%
So I'm estimating 40,000
good sightings a year,

00:09:59.780 --> 00:10:01.170 align:middle line:10%
which I think is low.

00:10:01.170 --> 00:10:03.350 align:middle line:10%
If I were to honestly
say what I think,

00:10:03.350 --> 00:10:07.640 align:middle line:10%
probably 100,000 good sightings
every year wouldn't shock me

00:10:07.640 --> 00:10:08.810 align:middle line:10%
in the least.

00:10:08.810 --> 00:10:10.290 align:middle line:90%
That's a lot of activity.

00:10:10.290 --> 00:10:15.060 align:middle line:84%
And then much more that's not
even being seen, I'm assuming.

00:10:15.060 --> 00:10:19.920 align:middle line:84%
So we're talking about the
fact that they are everywhere.

00:10:19.920 --> 00:10:24.060 align:middle line:10%
And they, in my view, they
are blanketing this world

00:10:24.060 --> 00:10:29.070 align:middle line:10%
with activity on a daily,
probably hourly basis, probably

00:10:29.070 --> 00:10:30.240 align:middle line:10%
anywhere, anywhere.

00:10:30.240 --> 00:10:31.180 align:middle line:10%
We're not seeing it.

00:10:31.180 --> 00:10:33.400 align:middle line:10%
They're really good
at being stealthy.

00:10:33.400 --> 00:10:35.050 align:middle line:10%
Very good, very good at that.

00:10:35.050 --> 00:10:36.580 align:middle line:90%
But they are everywhere.

00:10:36.580 --> 00:10:38.500 align:middle line:90%
And we may want to ask why.

00:10:38.500 --> 00:10:39.300 align:middle line:90%
Why?

00:10:39.300 --> 00:10:41.630 align:middle line:10%
Why are they everywhere?

00:10:41.630 --> 00:10:43.473 align:middle line:10%
Well, I got some theories.

00:10:43.473 --> 00:10:44.890 align:middle line:10%
I'm going to share
those with you.

00:10:44.890 --> 00:10:46.280 align:middle line:10%
First, I'm going to show
you a couple of pictures,

00:10:46.280 --> 00:10:47.697 align:middle line:10%
just because they're
kind of cool.

00:10:47.697 --> 00:10:50.700 align:middle line:84%
This is-- I have a couple
from 2007, not sure why.

00:10:50.700 --> 00:10:53.900 align:middle line:84%
And then I got a few
from more recent.

00:10:53.900 --> 00:10:55.500 align:middle line:90%
This is a really good one.

00:10:55.500 --> 00:10:58.250 align:middle line:84%
This might be the best
UFO photo of 2007.

00:10:58.250 --> 00:10:59.450 align:middle line:90%
Redondo Beach.

00:10:59.450 --> 00:11:01.930 align:middle line:84%
The witness had a very,
very interesting thing

00:11:01.930 --> 00:11:02.730 align:middle line:90%
to say about it.

00:11:02.730 --> 00:11:03.530 align:middle line:90%
He watched it.

00:11:03.530 --> 00:11:05.190 align:middle line:90%
It came in, zipped in.

00:11:05.190 --> 00:11:07.920 align:middle line:84%
He just had a camera
phone with him.

00:11:07.920 --> 00:11:08.720 align:middle line:90%
He took a picture.

00:11:08.720 --> 00:11:10.200 align:middle line:90%
And it just zipped away.

00:11:10.200 --> 00:11:15.120 align:middle line:84%
He was interviewed by a couple
of very reputable researchers.

00:11:15.120 --> 00:11:17.060 align:middle line:10%
It's a good case.

00:11:17.060 --> 00:11:19.948 align:middle line:10%
I think that's a
real picture there.

00:11:19.948 --> 00:11:21.740 align:middle line:84%
We've all heard about
the Tic Tac encounter

00:11:21.740 --> 00:11:26.580 align:middle line:84%
with the Nimitz group, but this
is the exact same area, 2007.

00:11:26.580 --> 00:11:27.710 align:middle line:90%
I got this off NUFORC.

00:11:27.710 --> 00:11:30.810 align:middle line:84%
I data mine the heck out of
NUFORC, National UFO Reporting

00:11:30.810 --> 00:11:31.610 align:middle line:90%
Center.

00:11:31.610 --> 00:11:33.770 align:middle line:90%
This is a Navy guy wrote in.

00:11:33.770 --> 00:11:35.430 align:middle line:90%
You can see the drawings he has.

00:11:35.430 --> 00:11:38.220 align:middle line:10%
This thing's moving kind of
like a zigzag and check motion.

00:11:38.220 --> 00:11:40.012 align:middle line:10%
I'm not going to read
the whole thing here,

00:11:40.012 --> 00:11:42.340 align:middle line:10%
but they're off the
coast of San Diego.

00:11:42.340 --> 00:11:44.770 align:middle line:90%
11:30 PM.

00:11:44.770 --> 00:11:45.890 align:middle line:90%
Objects come in.

00:11:45.890 --> 00:11:47.390 align:middle line:84%
This is what I want
to say about it.

00:11:47.390 --> 00:11:49.570 align:middle line:90%
I have it marked in red.

00:11:49.570 --> 00:11:52.610 align:middle line:10%
The bridge commander said to
the witness who wrote this in.

00:11:52.610 --> 00:11:57.650 align:middle line:10%
He said, my radar and computers
went down or froze at about 3:30

00:11:57.650 --> 00:11:58.450 align:middle line:10%
AM.

00:11:58.450 --> 00:12:00.730 align:middle line:10%
It had to be fixed
by electricians.

00:12:00.730 --> 00:12:05.500 align:middle line:10%
The reason I'm saying this is
because in my USO research, one

00:12:05.500 --> 00:12:11.090 align:middle line:10%
of the patterns I have
found is that these objects,

00:12:11.090 --> 00:12:15.440 align:middle line:10%
brace yourself here, on a
limited but definite number

00:12:15.440 --> 00:12:19.010 align:middle line:10%
of instances have had the
ability completely to shut down

00:12:19.010 --> 00:12:22.820 align:middle line:10%
United States aircraft
carriers and battle cruisers

00:12:22.820 --> 00:12:24.930 align:middle line:10%
and destroyers and also Soviet.

00:12:24.930 --> 00:12:27.860 align:middle line:10%
I got a bunch of those, too,
Soviet ones from the Russians.

00:12:27.860 --> 00:12:29.580 align:middle line:10%
But quite a few US Navy.

00:12:29.580 --> 00:12:32.270 align:middle line:10%
Now, the first one that I read,
I thought, well, OK, maybe.

00:12:32.270 --> 00:12:36.110 align:middle line:10%
Maybe he's misremembering, even
though it was a very precise

00:12:36.110 --> 00:12:37.220 align:middle line:10%
statement, I will say.

00:12:37.220 --> 00:12:40.430 align:middle line:10%
It was a Navy officer from the
USS Franklin Delano Roosevelt

00:12:40.430 --> 00:12:44.210 align:middle line:10%
from the 1950s who wrote in a
very detailed manner about how

00:12:44.210 --> 00:12:48.120 align:middle line:10%
this object shut all weapons and
electronic systems down for 30

00:12:48.120 --> 00:12:48.920 align:middle line:10%
minutes.

00:12:48.920 --> 00:12:51.503 align:middle line:84%
And then I read another account
from someone on the USS John F

00:12:51.503 --> 00:12:54.290 align:middle line:84%
Kennedy in 1971
in the Caribbean.

00:12:54.290 --> 00:12:58.340 align:middle line:10%
Shut down all communications
for 20 to 30 minutes.

00:12:58.340 --> 00:13:01.130 align:middle line:10%
Nothing but gobbledygook
over the comms.

00:13:01.130 --> 00:13:02.690 align:middle line:10%
And a bunch more.

00:13:02.690 --> 00:13:03.750 align:middle line:10%
A bunch more.

00:13:03.750 --> 00:13:05.570 align:middle line:10%
That's a pattern.

00:13:05.570 --> 00:13:07.970 align:middle line:10%
And then here's-- this is one.

00:13:07.970 --> 00:13:11.070 align:middle line:10%
This is just one.

00:13:11.070 --> 00:13:12.810 align:middle line:10%
I'm going to say one thing here.

00:13:12.810 --> 00:13:15.058 align:middle line:10%
I've not served in
the armed services,

00:13:15.058 --> 00:13:17.100 align:middle line:10%
and I've never been in
the intelligence community

00:13:17.100 --> 00:13:18.130 align:middle line:10%
or anything like that.

00:13:18.130 --> 00:13:20.940 align:middle line:10%
But I'm pretty darn sure that if
you're running the United States

00:13:20.940 --> 00:13:24.600 align:middle line:10%
Navy, there's not going to be
anything more important to you

00:13:24.600 --> 00:13:26.170 align:middle line:10%
than your aircraft carriers.

00:13:26.170 --> 00:13:30.750 align:middle line:10%
And if one of those is shut
down for 30 minutes at a time,

00:13:30.750 --> 00:13:32.160 align:middle line:10%
you're going to know about it.

00:13:32.160 --> 00:13:35.250 align:middle line:10%
And you're going to consider it
of extreme importance and which

00:13:35.250 --> 00:13:38.700 align:middle line:10%
tells me every single thing
we're hearing publicly coming

00:13:38.700 --> 00:13:42.810 align:middle line:10%
from Congress, coming from the
Pentagon about UAP today is

00:13:42.810 --> 00:13:48.060 align:middle line:10%
absolutely 100%, 1,000%
inadequate to meeting the truth

00:13:48.060 --> 00:13:50.680 align:middle line:10%
of what we're
actually dealing with.

00:13:50.680 --> 00:13:56.850 align:middle line:84%
There is no way, no way
that they do not know this.

00:13:56.850 --> 00:13:58.300 align:middle line:10%
Not a chance.

00:13:58.300 --> 00:14:01.020 align:middle line:10%
Not a chance.

00:14:01.020 --> 00:14:04.490 align:middle line:90%
So that's where it's located.

00:14:04.490 --> 00:14:06.420 align:middle line:90%
I just put it on the map there.

00:14:06.420 --> 00:14:11.550 align:middle line:10%
2008 photograph of a black
triangle over someplace

00:14:11.550 --> 00:14:12.647 align:middle line:10%
in Indiana.

00:14:12.647 --> 00:14:13.480 align:middle line:10%
It's a good picture.

00:14:13.480 --> 00:14:14.110 align:middle line:10%
I think it's real.

00:14:14.110 --> 00:14:14.500 align:middle line:10%
I don't know.

00:14:14.500 --> 00:14:15.542 align:middle line:10%
It could be photoshopped.

00:14:15.542 --> 00:14:16.920 align:middle line:10%
I don't think so.

00:14:16.920 --> 00:14:20.800 align:middle line:84%
This type of thing has been
seen and noted many times,

00:14:20.800 --> 00:14:21.600 align:middle line:90%
many times.

00:14:21.600 --> 00:14:22.860 align:middle line:90%
A drop in the bucket.

00:14:22.860 --> 00:14:27.000 align:middle line:10%
Some more recent ones, one
from Maine, one from Australia,

00:14:27.000 --> 00:14:28.680 align:middle line:10%
one from Greece.

00:14:28.680 --> 00:14:30.690 align:middle line:10%
You know, it's the pattern.

00:14:30.690 --> 00:14:32.160 align:middle line:10%
This goes on everywhere.

00:14:32.160 --> 00:14:34.660 align:middle line:10%
People will say, well, how come
there's no good photographs?

00:14:34.660 --> 00:14:37.110 align:middle line:10%
Well, there's a lot of
good photographs, actually.

00:14:37.110 --> 00:14:38.910 align:middle line:10%
The problem is that
a photograph is

00:14:38.910 --> 00:14:43.860 align:middle line:10%
no longer sufficient as proof.

00:14:43.860 --> 00:14:46.890 align:middle line:10%
I mean, that's the sad reality.

00:14:46.890 --> 00:14:51.690 align:middle line:10%
Even when they are subjected
to detailed analysis,

00:14:51.690 --> 00:14:54.170 align:middle line:10%
people are like, yeah,
but you never really know.

00:14:54.170 --> 00:14:54.970 align:middle line:10%
And this is true.

00:14:54.970 --> 00:14:57.250 align:middle line:10%
Like, you really--
it's hard to know.

00:14:57.250 --> 00:14:58.420 align:middle line:10%
It's hard to know.

00:14:58.420 --> 00:15:01.870 align:middle line:10%
How do we absolutely
determine that this is?

00:15:01.870 --> 00:15:03.590 align:middle line:10%
Well, there are
ways of doing it.

00:15:03.590 --> 00:15:05.440 align:middle line:10%
And there is
instrumentation, and there

00:15:05.440 --> 00:15:07.800 align:middle line:10%
is photographic visual, radar
evidence, and all of that

00:15:07.800 --> 00:15:08.600 align:middle line:10%
combined.

00:15:08.600 --> 00:15:10.840 align:middle line:10%
And I mean, you've got
to get to a certain level

00:15:10.840 --> 00:15:15.100 align:middle line:10%
where this evidence
reaches the level of proof.

00:15:15.100 --> 00:15:19.410 align:middle line:10%
But obviously, there
are people who are--

00:15:19.410 --> 00:15:22.480 align:middle line:10%
you know, there are just-- some
of them are public skeptics.

00:15:22.480 --> 00:15:25.180 align:middle line:10%
And it's very difficult to
change your opinion publicly.

00:15:25.180 --> 00:15:27.970 align:middle line:10%
I'll just say it's a lot
of pressure on these folks

00:15:27.970 --> 00:15:29.858 align:middle line:10%
when you take a
public opinion on this

00:15:29.858 --> 00:15:31.650 align:middle line:10%
then to have to change
it, because then you

00:15:31.650 --> 00:15:32.730 align:middle line:10%
end up looking foolish.

00:15:32.730 --> 00:15:33.910 align:middle line:10%
And no one wants to do that.

00:15:33.910 --> 00:15:35.740 align:middle line:10%
So they double down
and triple down.

00:15:35.740 --> 00:15:39.180 align:middle line:10%
But ultimately, a
photograph is just not

00:15:39.180 --> 00:15:40.780 align:middle line:10%
going to do the job anymore.

00:15:40.780 --> 00:15:42.850 align:middle line:10%
So that's it for UFO sightings.

00:15:42.850 --> 00:15:46.490 align:middle line:10%
Let me move on to encounters.

00:15:46.490 --> 00:15:51.080 align:middle line:84%
And I'm not going to talk too
much about encounters today,

00:15:51.080 --> 00:15:53.750 align:middle line:84%
although it's
extremely important.

00:15:53.750 --> 00:15:56.930 align:middle line:10%
And what I'm simply
referring to is--

00:15:56.930 --> 00:16:00.350 align:middle line:10%
are the claims and
experiences of many people,

00:16:00.350 --> 00:16:02.930 align:middle line:10%
I'm sure many of
you who are here,

00:16:02.930 --> 00:16:09.260 align:middle line:10%
who have had experiences
that you know or at least you

00:16:09.260 --> 00:16:13.610 align:middle line:10%
strongly feel are intelligences
that are not from, you know,

00:16:13.610 --> 00:16:15.950 align:middle line:10%
our neck of the
woods, whether they're

00:16:15.950 --> 00:16:18.530 align:middle line:10%
from another planet, another
dimension of reality.

00:16:18.530 --> 00:16:20.780 align:middle line:10%
You know, it's hard for us
to understand these things,

00:16:20.780 --> 00:16:22.590 align:middle line:10%
so we should cut
ourselves some slack.

00:16:22.590 --> 00:16:28.270 align:middle line:10%
But the fact is this is
going on on a wide scale.

00:16:28.270 --> 00:16:32.400 align:middle line:10%
It is not restricted to the
United States by any means.

00:16:32.400 --> 00:16:33.830 align:middle line:10%
We tend to talk more about this.

00:16:33.830 --> 00:16:34.830 align:middle line:10%
This is just how we are.

00:16:34.830 --> 00:16:37.430 align:middle line:10%
But this happens everywhere.

00:16:37.430 --> 00:16:42.020 align:middle line:10%
And I am convinced, and I can't
give you statistics to prove it,

00:16:42.020 --> 00:16:45.020 align:middle line:10%
but I am convinced that this
is vastly underreported,

00:16:45.020 --> 00:16:46.650 align:middle line:10%
and for obvious reasons.

00:16:46.650 --> 00:16:48.500 align:middle line:10%
How do you talk about--

00:16:48.500 --> 00:16:50.850 align:middle line:10%
with the public, let
alone family members even?

00:16:50.850 --> 00:16:54.290 align:middle line:84%
It's very difficult.
You know, people--

00:16:54.290 --> 00:16:55.820 align:middle line:84%
you know, they say
public speaking

00:16:55.820 --> 00:16:57.570 align:middle line:84%
is one of the greatest
fears in the world.

00:16:57.570 --> 00:16:59.010 align:middle line:90%
Not-- hey, not for me, luckily.

00:16:59.010 --> 00:17:01.640 align:middle line:10%
But it's a terror,
because you're

00:17:01.640 --> 00:17:04.099 align:middle line:10%
putting yourself out there.

00:17:04.099 --> 00:17:06.210 align:middle line:10%
And it is frightening.

00:17:06.210 --> 00:17:10.550 align:middle line:10%
And so to put yourself out there
for an abduction experience,

00:17:10.550 --> 00:17:13.020 align:middle line:10%
that's-- come on, that's a
bridge too far for most people.

00:17:13.020 --> 00:17:14.579 align:middle line:10%
It's not going to happen.

00:17:14.579 --> 00:17:16.319 align:middle line:10%
And it does bad things
to us, you know?

00:17:16.319 --> 00:17:19.710 align:middle line:10%
Because it's like you've
got this intensely powerful,

00:17:19.710 --> 00:17:24.089 align:middle line:10%
profound, sometimes traumatic,
sometimes profound and amazing,

00:17:24.089 --> 00:17:29.490 align:middle line:10%
incredible experience that
changes your life completely.

00:17:29.490 --> 00:17:32.070 align:middle line:84%
And who do you
talk to about that?

00:17:32.070 --> 00:17:34.050 align:middle line:90%
A couple of friends, you know?

00:17:34.050 --> 00:17:35.190 align:middle line:90%
Maybe.

00:17:35.190 --> 00:17:36.742 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes people
just put it away,

00:17:36.742 --> 00:17:38.200 align:middle line:84%
and they don't even
think about it.

00:17:38.200 --> 00:17:39.900 align:middle line:90%
It just-- up come the walls.

00:17:39.900 --> 00:17:41.560 align:middle line:90%
Compartmentalize, because we do.

00:17:41.560 --> 00:17:42.370 align:middle line:90%
We're good at that.

00:17:42.370 --> 00:17:44.190 align:middle line:84%
We compartmentalize
it, and it goes away

00:17:44.190 --> 00:17:46.100 align:middle line:90%
as if it never happened.

00:17:46.100 --> 00:17:52.620 align:middle line:10%
But I think it's very much going
on on a wide-spread, wide scale.

00:17:52.620 --> 00:17:55.790 align:middle line:10%
So agendas.

00:17:55.790 --> 00:17:58.700 align:middle line:10%
I'm going to be talking
about this for a while.

00:17:58.700 --> 00:18:00.810 align:middle line:90%
What is going on?

00:18:00.810 --> 00:18:02.480 align:middle line:90%
Why?

00:18:02.480 --> 00:18:05.780 align:middle line:84%
Well, I'm going to suggest
there is a definite interest

00:18:05.780 --> 00:18:06.940 align:middle line:90%
in humanity.

00:18:06.940 --> 00:18:08.180 align:middle line:10%
You'll see why.

00:18:08.180 --> 00:18:09.690 align:middle line:10%
I'm going to make
this very clear.

00:18:09.690 --> 00:18:12.620 align:middle line:10%
Definite interest in us.

00:18:12.620 --> 00:18:16.550 align:middle line:10%
I would also say an interest
in other life forms here.

00:18:16.550 --> 00:18:18.450 align:middle line:10%
We have an amazing planet.

00:18:18.450 --> 00:18:20.360 align:middle line:84%
I mean, yes, we
believe, OK, there's

00:18:20.360 --> 00:18:21.690 align:middle line:90%
a lot of life in this universe.

00:18:21.690 --> 00:18:24.230 align:middle line:84%
We haven't found it
yet, but we believe it.

00:18:24.230 --> 00:18:27.800 align:middle line:10%
And I have no doubt it's true,
because, well, that's probably

00:18:27.800 --> 00:18:31.670 align:middle line:10%
a good way to explain what's
going on with this phenomenon.

00:18:31.670 --> 00:18:35.900 align:middle line:10%
But I'm going to submit to you
that planets like ours are not

00:18:35.900 --> 00:18:37.700 align:middle line:10%
just a dime a dozen.

00:18:37.700 --> 00:18:41.040 align:middle line:10%
No, this is a real jewel.

00:18:41.040 --> 00:18:44.330 align:middle line:10%
So life here is going
to be highly valued

00:18:44.330 --> 00:18:47.490 align:middle line:10%
by any visitor that's
able to get here.

00:18:47.490 --> 00:18:48.960 align:middle line:10%
So they're interested in us.

00:18:48.960 --> 00:18:50.960 align:middle line:10%
They're interested
in other life forms,

00:18:50.960 --> 00:18:53.490 align:middle line:10%
probably interested
in resources on Earth.

00:18:53.490 --> 00:18:54.860 align:middle line:10%
I mean, we have water.

00:18:54.860 --> 00:18:57.210 align:middle line:10%
We have heavy minerals
around the crust.

00:18:57.210 --> 00:18:59.000 align:middle line:10%
That's not normal.

00:18:59.000 --> 00:19:02.850 align:middle line:10%
I was studying up on
this, planetary formation.

00:19:02.850 --> 00:19:05.510 align:middle line:84%
Rocky planets like ours,
most of the heavy minerals

00:19:05.510 --> 00:19:07.910 align:middle line:84%
on most rocky planets
are deep down below,

00:19:07.910 --> 00:19:10.190 align:middle line:84%
because they're heavy and
the gravity pulls them down.

00:19:10.190 --> 00:19:11.690 align:middle line:10%
We're a little
different, because we

00:19:11.690 --> 00:19:13.690 align:middle line:10%
had a little collision
early in our history that

00:19:13.690 --> 00:19:15.390 align:middle line:10%
gave us our moon.

00:19:15.390 --> 00:19:17.000 align:middle line:10%
And it stirred things up.

00:19:17.000 --> 00:19:19.320 align:middle line:10%
This is planetary experts,
not me telling you this.

00:19:19.320 --> 00:19:23.990 align:middle line:10%
And it left a massive residue
of heavy metals at our crust

00:19:23.990 --> 00:19:25.080 align:middle line:10%
that we can access.

00:19:25.080 --> 00:19:26.490 align:middle line:10%
That's why we had
the Bronze Age.

00:19:26.490 --> 00:19:29.420 align:middle line:10%
That's why we had human
civilization the way we did,

00:19:29.420 --> 00:19:31.320 align:middle line:10%
because we were able
to get those metals.

00:19:31.320 --> 00:19:34.370 align:middle line:10%
Normally, that would be
difficult to get them.

00:19:34.370 --> 00:19:35.760 align:middle line:10%
We got kind of lucky.

00:19:35.760 --> 00:19:38.090 align:middle line:10%
So we have this.

00:19:38.090 --> 00:19:41.480 align:middle line:10%
And so I would think that any
visitors that are here, they're

00:19:41.480 --> 00:19:42.380 align:middle line:10%
like, oh wow, wow.

00:19:42.380 --> 00:19:43.790 align:middle line:10%
You can get all this
iron, all this stuff.

00:19:43.790 --> 00:19:45.420 align:middle line:10%
That's all right
there at the surface.

00:19:45.420 --> 00:19:46.220 align:middle line:10%
Great.

00:19:46.220 --> 00:19:49.580 align:middle line:10%
So that's a neat
thing about Earth.

00:19:49.580 --> 00:19:54.150 align:middle line:10%
We're this-- this is an
amazing oasis in space.

00:19:54.150 --> 00:19:56.610 align:middle line:10%
So there's a lot of reasons
others would be here.

00:19:56.610 --> 00:20:00.030 align:middle line:10%
But I still think we, we
human beings, we're the key.

00:20:00.030 --> 00:20:00.890 align:middle line:10%
I'll explain why.

00:20:00.890 --> 00:20:04.710 align:middle line:10%
But first, I'm going to say,
how common is Earth actually?

00:20:04.710 --> 00:20:06.790 align:middle line:84%
How common are
Earth-like planets?

00:20:06.790 --> 00:20:08.970 align:middle line:10%
Well, you know, when
I started getting

00:20:08.970 --> 00:20:12.060 align:middle line:10%
into this subject of
UFOs many years ago,

00:20:12.060 --> 00:20:16.510 align:middle line:10%
we didn't really have that many
confirmed exoplanets to study,

00:20:16.510 --> 00:20:17.310 align:middle line:10%
you know?

00:20:17.310 --> 00:20:18.640 align:middle line:10%
But we got a bunch now.

00:20:18.640 --> 00:20:21.550 align:middle line:10%
Now, we're still
at baby steps here.

00:20:21.550 --> 00:20:25.980 align:middle line:10%
So samples--
everything I say here

00:20:25.980 --> 00:20:32.400 align:middle line:10%
we must take with a huge
grain of reservation,

00:20:32.400 --> 00:20:34.120 align:middle line:10%
if not skepticism.

00:20:34.120 --> 00:20:36.277 align:middle line:10%
But let me just say
where we are at now,

00:20:36.277 --> 00:20:37.860 align:middle line:10%
where scientists who
study exoplanets.

00:20:37.860 --> 00:20:42.480 align:middle line:84%
We have a little over 5,436
confirmed exoplanets as of this

00:20:42.480 --> 00:20:46.290 align:middle line:84%
week, because I looked it up,
that scientists have found.

00:20:46.290 --> 00:20:51.330 align:middle line:84%
And they're studying another
almost 10,000 more right now.

00:20:51.330 --> 00:20:52.600 align:middle line:90%
They're under review.

00:20:52.600 --> 00:20:55.360 align:middle line:90%
So 5,000 plus confirmed.

00:20:55.360 --> 00:20:56.160 align:middle line:90%
Pretty cool.

00:20:56.160 --> 00:21:02.010 align:middle line:84%
Of that 5,000, about 50 of
them have been identified

00:21:02.010 --> 00:21:04.090 align:middle line:90%
as potentially habitable.

00:21:04.090 --> 00:21:07.290 align:middle line:10%
So basically, that just means
they're rocky like Earth

00:21:07.290 --> 00:21:09.600 align:middle line:10%
and they're within
the right zone

00:21:09.600 --> 00:21:11.610 align:middle line:10%
where there could
be liquid water--

00:21:11.610 --> 00:21:16.598 align:middle line:10%
is of great potential,
if not confirmed.

00:21:16.598 --> 00:21:18.890 align:middle line:10%
I don't think that they've
confirmed liquid water, just

00:21:18.890 --> 00:21:19.680 align:middle line:10%
its potential.

00:21:19.680 --> 00:21:20.480 align:middle line:10%
So 50.

00:21:20.480 --> 00:21:24.410 align:middle line:10%
So it's a little under 1%
so far what we've found.

00:21:24.410 --> 00:21:28.460 align:middle line:84%
Now again, maybe our
instrumentations are not good.

00:21:28.460 --> 00:21:30.530 align:middle line:84%
This is something I don't
know, so I don't want

00:21:30.530 --> 00:21:32.420 align:middle line:90%
to speak out of my area here.

00:21:32.420 --> 00:21:34.520 align:middle line:10%
But it's possible
that maybe we're

00:21:34.520 --> 00:21:38.210 align:middle line:10%
better at detecting the gas
giants than the smaller planets.

00:21:38.210 --> 00:21:40.983 align:middle line:10%
The impression you get
from reading and listening

00:21:40.983 --> 00:21:42.650 align:middle line:10%
to these astronomers
who are doing this,

00:21:42.650 --> 00:21:46.130 align:middle line:10%
though, is they're
talking pretty confidently

00:21:46.130 --> 00:21:47.760 align:middle line:10%
about what they're seeing.

00:21:47.760 --> 00:21:53.720 align:middle line:10%
And I don't know, but we'll just
say, so about a little under 1%

00:21:53.720 --> 00:21:56.130 align:middle line:10%
have been identified as
potentially habitable.

00:21:56.130 --> 00:21:58.610 align:middle line:84%
So the Milky Way
galaxy, we've got 100--

00:21:58.610 --> 00:22:01.590 align:middle line:84%
anywhere from 100 to
400 billion planets.

00:22:01.590 --> 00:22:02.880 align:middle line:90%
That's a pretty big range.

00:22:02.880 --> 00:22:04.790 align:middle line:84%
But it is based on,
you know, how many

00:22:04.790 --> 00:22:06.210 align:middle line:90%
planets did the stars have.

00:22:06.210 --> 00:22:08.840 align:middle line:10%
And our solar
system, by the way,

00:22:08.840 --> 00:22:11.030 align:middle line:10%
is considered to be
one of the largest

00:22:11.030 --> 00:22:13.680 align:middle line:10%
that we've discovered so far,
the most number of planets.

00:22:13.680 --> 00:22:16.097 align:middle line:10%
And again, I wonder, is that
because we're not good enough

00:22:16.097 --> 00:22:17.790 align:middle line:10%
at finding all the
small, little ones

00:22:17.790 --> 00:22:19.180 align:middle line:10%
that are as tiny as Mercury?

00:22:19.180 --> 00:22:20.190 align:middle line:10%
I don't know.

00:22:20.190 --> 00:22:21.650 align:middle line:10%
I don't know.

00:22:21.650 --> 00:22:23.400 align:middle line:10%
But anyway, so it's a
pretty wide estimate

00:22:23.400 --> 00:22:24.700 align:middle line:10%
of number of planets.

00:22:24.700 --> 00:22:26.590 align:middle line:10%
So could that mean
that there's 1 to 4

00:22:26.590 --> 00:22:27.910 align:middle line:10%
billion habitable planets?

00:22:27.910 --> 00:22:34.590 align:middle line:10%
No, it doesn't mean that,
because at least everything

00:22:34.590 --> 00:22:36.900 align:middle line:10%
that I'm able to
understand about this--

00:22:36.900 --> 00:22:38.568 align:middle line:10%
I actually read a good portion.

00:22:38.568 --> 00:22:40.860 align:middle line:10%
There was a study from the
National Academy of Sciences

00:22:40.860 --> 00:22:43.230 align:middle line:10%
from about 10 years
ago, suggested

00:22:43.230 --> 00:22:48.990 align:middle line:10%
that anywhere from 0.1% to 2%
of potentially habitable planets

00:22:48.990 --> 00:22:52.070 align:middle line:10%
might actually be
suitable for life.

00:22:52.070 --> 00:22:56.890 align:middle line:10%
So you're taking 1% of the 1%.

00:22:56.890 --> 00:23:00.850 align:middle line:84%
So that's anywhere from between
1 out of 1,000 to 1 out of 50,

00:23:00.850 --> 00:23:03.050 align:middle line:84%
depending on all the
different variables.

00:23:03.050 --> 00:23:06.120 align:middle line:84%
So that could translate
between 1 million and 80

00:23:06.120 --> 00:23:09.200 align:middle line:90%
million habitable exoplanets.

00:23:09.200 --> 00:23:10.060 align:middle line:90%
That's a lot.

00:23:10.060 --> 00:23:12.520 align:middle line:10%
I mean, it's actually
tiny, minuscule

00:23:12.520 --> 00:23:15.660 align:middle line:10%
compared with the number
of stars and planets

00:23:15.660 --> 00:23:16.460 align:middle line:10%
that are out there.

00:23:16.460 --> 00:23:18.110 align:middle line:10%
But it's still, hey, a million.

00:23:18.110 --> 00:23:18.910 align:middle line:10%
That's a lot.

00:23:18.910 --> 00:23:20.030 align:middle line:10%
I'd like to have
a million dollars.

00:23:20.030 --> 00:23:20.830 align:middle line:10%
That's a lot.

00:23:20.830 --> 00:23:27.070 align:middle line:10%
But as a fraction, it would
mean that anywhere between 1 out

00:23:27.070 --> 00:23:33.790 align:middle line:10%
of 5,000 or 1 out of 100,000
planets are suitable for life,

00:23:33.790 --> 00:23:35.620 align:middle line:10%
actually suitable for life.

00:23:35.620 --> 00:23:41.680 align:middle line:10%
So Earth, at a minimum, is
a 1 out of 5,000 planet.

00:23:41.680 --> 00:23:44.960 align:middle line:10%
And it's probably a much
smaller fraction than that.

00:23:44.960 --> 00:23:48.670 align:middle line:10%
So what I'm saying is that
planets like ours don't just

00:23:48.670 --> 00:23:49.810 align:middle line:10%
happen all the time.

00:23:49.810 --> 00:23:51.530 align:middle line:10%
And they are valuable.

00:23:51.530 --> 00:23:53.560 align:middle line:10%
They must be valuable.

00:23:53.560 --> 00:23:56.470 align:middle line:10%
So when someone finds this
world, they're like, ah,

00:23:56.470 --> 00:24:00.610 align:middle line:10%
this is a place
worth checking out.

00:24:00.610 --> 00:24:03.380 align:middle line:10%
But we're not done yet.

00:24:03.380 --> 00:24:06.140 align:middle line:10%
How many of those habitable,
potentially habitable planets

00:24:06.140 --> 00:24:07.310 align:middle line:10%
actually have life?

00:24:07.310 --> 00:24:10.170 align:middle line:84%
And how many of those
have technological life?

00:24:10.170 --> 00:24:11.120 align:middle line:90%
Well, I'm going to--

00:24:11.120 --> 00:24:12.480 align:middle line:90%
this is a little thing I--

00:24:12.480 --> 00:24:14.170 align:middle line:90%
I'm going to go quickly here.

00:24:14.170 --> 00:24:15.120 align:middle line:90%
I put this together.

00:24:15.120 --> 00:24:16.495 align:middle line:84%
I was proud of
this little thing.

00:24:16.495 --> 00:24:18.350 align:middle line:84%
So this is the Earth's
life right here,

00:24:18.350 --> 00:24:19.820 align:middle line:90%
10 billion years, roughly.

00:24:19.820 --> 00:24:23.740 align:middle line:10%
Earth's life expectancy
is about 10 billion years.

00:24:23.740 --> 00:24:26.110 align:middle line:10%
And the reason is because
after 10 billion years,

00:24:26.110 --> 00:24:28.100 align:middle line:10%
the sun is just going
to go all bonkers on us.

00:24:28.100 --> 00:24:29.392 align:middle line:10%
And that's going to be the end.

00:24:29.392 --> 00:24:32.627 align:middle line:10%
But even before that happens,
thing-- real bad things

00:24:32.627 --> 00:24:33.710 align:middle line:10%
are going to be happening.

00:24:33.710 --> 00:24:37.450 align:middle line:10%
So the sun's solar radiation
increases by about 10%

00:24:37.450 --> 00:24:39.040 align:middle line:10%
every one billion years.

00:24:39.040 --> 00:24:40.565 align:middle line:10%
Just happens.

00:24:40.565 --> 00:24:41.690 align:middle line:10%
I got no control over this.

00:24:41.690 --> 00:24:42.470 align:middle line:10%
I'm just a messenger.

00:24:42.470 --> 00:24:43.345 align:middle line:10%
I'm just telling you.

00:24:43.345 --> 00:24:49.180 align:middle line:10%
So the history of the Earth, in
the first half a billion years,

00:24:49.180 --> 00:24:52.580 align:middle line:10%
basically, it was an
uninhabitable hellscape.

00:24:52.580 --> 00:24:54.850 align:middle line:10%
You couldn't-- you
couldn't live there.

00:24:54.850 --> 00:24:56.180 align:middle line:10%
Things got a little better.

00:24:56.180 --> 00:24:58.425 align:middle line:10%
And in the oceans, we
started getting bombarded

00:24:58.425 --> 00:25:00.550 align:middle line:10%
with all these asteroids
that gave us all the water

00:25:00.550 --> 00:25:04.070 align:middle line:10%
and filled us up, got a lot of
oceans, and it was really great.

00:25:04.070 --> 00:25:06.010 align:middle line:10%
And eventually,
we started getting

00:25:06.010 --> 00:25:09.040 align:middle line:10%
these little microbial
life forms in the oceans.

00:25:09.040 --> 00:25:12.410 align:middle line:84%
And for several billion
years, that's all we had.

00:25:12.410 --> 00:25:13.210 align:middle line:90%
That's all.

00:25:13.210 --> 00:25:14.620 align:middle line:84%
The atmosphere
was uninhabitable.

00:25:14.620 --> 00:25:15.620 align:middle line:90%
You couldn't breathe it.

00:25:15.620 --> 00:25:19.750 align:middle line:84%
It was not a good place to be
unless you were a microorganism

00:25:19.750 --> 00:25:22.330 align:middle line:90%
by a heat vent by the ocean.

00:25:22.330 --> 00:25:23.810 align:middle line:90%
That was about it.

00:25:23.810 --> 00:25:28.130 align:middle line:10%
But eventually, because life is
really cool and it's persistent

00:25:28.130 --> 00:25:32.120 align:middle line:10%
and it grows, we got into what
is called the Cambrian explosion

00:25:32.120 --> 00:25:34.880 align:middle line:10%
about half of 1 billion
years ago, which

00:25:34.880 --> 00:25:36.720 align:middle line:10%
is identified right there.

00:25:36.720 --> 00:25:38.450 align:middle line:10%
You can see it's kind of recent.

00:25:38.450 --> 00:25:41.310 align:middle line:10%
540 million years ago
is not that long ago

00:25:41.310 --> 00:25:42.800 align:middle line:10%
when you really get into it.

00:25:42.800 --> 00:25:45.440 align:middle line:10%
That is when life
becomes complex.

00:25:45.440 --> 00:25:47.210 align:middle line:10%
Life in the oceans.

00:25:47.210 --> 00:25:49.840 align:middle line:10%
You eventually get bony fish
and all the other cool things

00:25:49.840 --> 00:25:50.640 align:middle line:10%
and the creatures.

00:25:50.640 --> 00:25:53.300 align:middle line:10%
You start getting life on
land in the form of plants

00:25:53.300 --> 00:25:55.620 align:middle line:10%
and oxygenating the atmosphere.

00:25:55.620 --> 00:25:57.980 align:middle line:10%
And then suddenly,
wonderful things happen.

00:25:57.980 --> 00:26:01.220 align:middle line:84%
And you move into what I have
there, is that nice green zone.

00:26:01.220 --> 00:26:04.760 align:middle line:10%
And we're smack dab in the
middle of that green zone

00:26:04.760 --> 00:26:08.407 align:middle line:10%
of explosive life on Earth.

00:26:08.407 --> 00:26:10.740 align:middle line:84%
And basically, it's going to
last about a billion years.

00:26:10.740 --> 00:26:12.110 align:middle line:90%
We're halfway through it.

00:26:12.110 --> 00:26:16.800 align:middle line:84%
It'll go for a little
more than that.

00:26:16.800 --> 00:26:19.820 align:middle line:10%
But it won't be fun, because
the solar radiation from the sun

00:26:19.820 --> 00:26:22.680 align:middle line:10%
is going to increasingly
make life here impossible.

00:26:22.680 --> 00:26:25.550 align:middle line:10%
And about 1 billion
years from now,

00:26:25.550 --> 00:26:28.093 align:middle line:10%
estimates are it's
all going to go away.

00:26:28.093 --> 00:26:30.260 align:middle line:10%
It will not be possible to
have life on this planet,

00:26:30.260 --> 00:26:32.780 align:middle line:10%
because the solar radiation
will be too hard, too high,

00:26:32.780 --> 00:26:34.940 align:middle line:10%
and it'll go right back
to being the hellscape

00:26:34.940 --> 00:26:36.510 align:middle line:10%
that it was at the beginning.

00:26:36.510 --> 00:26:38.135 align:middle line:10%
And that will be for
the rest of Earth.

00:26:38.135 --> 00:26:43.700 align:middle line:10%
So Earth's existence, for
life anyway, is limited.

00:26:43.700 --> 00:26:46.040 align:middle line:10%
Maybe 10% to 15% of
its entire history

00:26:46.040 --> 00:26:48.470 align:middle line:10%
will have complex
life, a little more

00:26:48.470 --> 00:26:50.210 align:middle line:10%
if you want to
include the microbes.

00:26:50.210 --> 00:26:54.680 align:middle line:10%
So maybe half of its existence
will have life very likely.

00:26:54.680 --> 00:26:56.113 align:middle line:90%
But that bright--

00:26:56.113 --> 00:26:58.280 align:middle line:84%
I don't know if you can see
a bright green line down

00:26:58.280 --> 00:26:59.080 align:middle line:90%
the center.

00:26:59.080 --> 00:27:00.870 align:middle line:10%
I made it intentionally bright.

00:27:00.870 --> 00:27:02.300 align:middle line:10%
I can see it on my screen.

00:27:02.300 --> 00:27:04.220 align:middle line:10%
That's a representation
of humans.

00:27:04.220 --> 00:27:05.652 align:middle line:10%
And that's way too thick.

00:27:05.652 --> 00:27:07.735 align:middle line:10%
But, you know, I've got
to put something in there.

00:27:07.735 --> 00:27:11.600 align:middle line:90%


00:27:11.600 --> 00:27:15.030 align:middle line:10%
There is no evidence
that I have seen,

00:27:15.030 --> 00:27:17.760 align:middle line:10%
and I don't think that
any expert would agree to,

00:27:17.760 --> 00:27:20.040 align:middle line:10%
that indicates that we
had technological life

00:27:20.040 --> 00:27:23.370 align:middle line:10%
before human beings
invented it on this planet.

00:27:23.370 --> 00:27:25.687 align:middle line:10%
We have theories about
ancient civilizations.

00:27:25.687 --> 00:27:27.270 align:middle line:10%
Graham Hancock talks
about this a lot,

00:27:27.270 --> 00:27:30.330 align:middle line:10%
but even his theories only
go back a few thousand years.

00:27:30.330 --> 00:27:32.670 align:middle line:10%
They don't go back
millions of years.

00:27:32.670 --> 00:27:34.360 align:middle line:10%
There was "Forbidden
Archaeology."

00:27:34.360 --> 00:27:35.350 align:middle line:10%
I read it a while ago.

00:27:35.350 --> 00:27:39.570 align:middle line:10%
I will say that I
don't think that there

00:27:39.570 --> 00:27:42.270 align:middle line:10%
is any evidence that we had
advanced technology until we

00:27:42.270 --> 00:27:45.370 align:middle line:10%
human beings invented it
during the Age of Science.

00:27:45.370 --> 00:27:55.930 align:middle line:10%
And so what that means is that
this is the window right here.

00:27:55.930 --> 00:27:59.580 align:middle line:10%
Any life form that
has the ability

00:27:59.580 --> 00:28:05.060 align:middle line:10%
to monitor this
existence, this universe,

00:28:05.060 --> 00:28:08.010 align:middle line:10%
they're going to want to be
here right now, right now,

00:28:08.010 --> 00:28:12.180 align:middle line:10%
right now, because this is where
we're making things happen.

00:28:12.180 --> 00:28:15.050 align:middle line:84%
So they're interested
in humanity,

00:28:15.050 --> 00:28:18.540 align:middle line:84%
our technological development,
our domination of the planet.

00:28:18.540 --> 00:28:23.480 align:middle line:10%
They've got to be wondering
our biological capabilities,

00:28:23.480 --> 00:28:27.850 align:middle line:10%
our mental, our
psychic capabilities.

00:28:27.850 --> 00:28:31.440 align:middle line:84%
And there's no open
engagement with us.

00:28:31.440 --> 00:28:32.240 align:middle line:90%
Why not?

00:28:32.240 --> 00:28:33.282 align:middle line:10%
Why aren't they opening--

00:28:33.282 --> 00:28:36.280 align:middle line:10%
openly engaging with us?

00:28:36.280 --> 00:28:41.080 align:middle line:10%
Well, if we were to time
travel back a mere 1,000 years

00:28:41.080 --> 00:28:46.090 align:middle line:10%
to medieval Europe, how much
could you tell them about

00:28:46.090 --> 00:28:48.460 align:middle line:10%
our world without
their heads exploding?

00:28:48.460 --> 00:28:49.470 align:middle line:10%
Not much.

00:28:49.470 --> 00:28:50.270 align:middle line:10%
Not much at all.

00:28:50.270 --> 00:28:52.750 align:middle line:10%
Let alone, you know,
that hunter-gatherer

00:28:52.750 --> 00:28:55.030 align:middle line:10%
that we want to bring
into the Luxor Hotel.

00:28:55.030 --> 00:28:57.100 align:middle line:10%
Not-- you couldn't.

00:28:57.100 --> 00:28:59.410 align:middle line:10%
You-- it would not be possible.

00:28:59.410 --> 00:29:02.650 align:middle line:10%
So even with their
best interests

00:29:02.650 --> 00:29:08.020 align:middle line:10%
in heart with us, which is
possible in some cases, how

00:29:08.020 --> 00:29:11.165 align:middle line:10%
could they really
tell us without--

00:29:11.165 --> 00:29:13.540 align:middle line:10%
you know, we like to think we
can handle a lot of things,

00:29:13.540 --> 00:29:15.220 align:middle line:10%
but can we really--
can we actually

00:29:15.220 --> 00:29:17.240 align:middle line:10%
handle what they are
prepared to tell us?

00:29:17.240 --> 00:29:18.700 align:middle line:90%
I don't know.

00:29:18.700 --> 00:29:20.490 align:middle line:90%
I'm not sure.

00:29:20.490 --> 00:29:24.400 align:middle line:10%
What if we're like their garden?

00:29:24.400 --> 00:29:25.540 align:middle line:10%
They've grown us.

00:29:25.540 --> 00:29:26.840 align:middle line:10%
Or they're interested in us.

00:29:26.840 --> 00:29:28.870 align:middle line:10%
We're their project, right?

00:29:28.870 --> 00:29:33.850 align:middle line:10%
And so they're looking
at us, and they're like,

00:29:33.850 --> 00:29:35.050 align:middle line:10%
I helped to make that.

00:29:35.050 --> 00:29:36.110 align:middle line:10%
Maybe they did.

00:29:36.110 --> 00:29:38.380 align:middle line:10%
They-- or they helped
to guide us in some way.

00:29:38.380 --> 00:29:40.840 align:middle line:10%
Or even if they
didn't do that, what

00:29:40.840 --> 00:29:43.540 align:middle line:10%
if they're just
interested because they

00:29:43.540 --> 00:29:46.420 align:middle line:10%
know what we're about to do?

00:29:46.420 --> 00:29:48.480 align:middle line:10%
They're like, oh, they've
developed language.

00:29:48.480 --> 00:29:49.280 align:middle line:10%
Yeah, OK.

00:29:49.280 --> 00:29:50.120 align:middle line:90%
They're on the fast track.

00:29:50.120 --> 00:29:52.220 align:middle line:84%
They're going to develop
science before long.

00:29:52.220 --> 00:29:53.020 align:middle line:90%
We all know it.

00:29:53.020 --> 00:29:53.830 align:middle line:90%
So let's watch.

00:29:53.830 --> 00:29:55.000 align:middle line:90%
And now they're watching us.

00:29:55.000 --> 00:29:59.560 align:middle line:84%
And they're seeing what we're
doing to ourselves in terms

00:29:59.560 --> 00:30:01.870 align:middle line:84%
of what we eat, the
artificial stuff,

00:30:01.870 --> 00:30:08.530 align:middle line:84%
the plastics in our system, the
pharmaceuticals we're taking,

00:30:08.530 --> 00:30:09.460 align:middle line:90%
all--

00:30:09.460 --> 00:30:11.960 align:middle line:84%
all this stuff that we're doing
to ourselves and, of course,

00:30:11.960 --> 00:30:14.080 align:middle line:90%
to the world.

00:30:14.080 --> 00:30:16.750 align:middle line:90%
They've got to be thinking.

00:30:16.750 --> 00:30:18.365 align:middle line:90%
Is that why they're--

00:30:18.365 --> 00:30:20.240 align:middle line:84%
is that part of why
they're abducting people?

00:30:20.240 --> 00:30:21.530 align:middle line:90%
Are they are they testing us?

00:30:21.530 --> 00:30:26.133 align:middle line:10%
They're like, let's check their
radiation levels or their, you

00:30:26.133 --> 00:30:27.800 align:middle line:10%
know, their plastic
levels or, you know,

00:30:27.800 --> 00:30:29.940 align:middle line:10%
what they're doing to
their hormones or whatever.

00:30:29.940 --> 00:30:31.820 align:middle line:10%
Yeah, I wouldn't
be shocked at all.

00:30:31.820 --> 00:30:34.170 align:middle line:90%
It's like a longitudinal study.

00:30:34.170 --> 00:30:36.150 align:middle line:90%
I bet that's part of it.

00:30:36.150 --> 00:30:39.690 align:middle line:10%
But they're not openly
engaging with us.

00:30:39.690 --> 00:30:42.330 align:middle line:10%
And then you have to wonder,
do they want to help us?

00:30:42.330 --> 00:30:44.110 align:middle line:10%
Or are we in their way?

00:30:44.110 --> 00:30:48.030 align:middle line:10%
And it could be both, because
you could see them thinking,

00:30:48.030 --> 00:30:54.510 align:middle line:10%
OK, these walking primates are
actually very, very interesting.

00:30:54.510 --> 00:30:56.140 align:middle line:10%
And they're incredibly valuable.

00:30:56.140 --> 00:30:59.470 align:middle line:10%
And they have great
possibilities here.

00:30:59.470 --> 00:31:02.130 align:middle line:10%
And they have already
done great things.

00:31:02.130 --> 00:31:03.567 align:middle line:10%
Hey, they gave us Beethoven.

00:31:03.567 --> 00:31:05.400 align:middle line:10%
They gave us all these
other amazing things.

00:31:05.400 --> 00:31:08.520 align:middle line:10%
They're capable of greatness.

00:31:08.520 --> 00:31:09.970 align:middle line:10%
I'm sure they see that.

00:31:09.970 --> 00:31:14.700 align:middle line:10%
But then, of course, there's
the other side, our nasty side,

00:31:14.700 --> 00:31:16.830 align:middle line:10%
our violent side, which is
intrinsic to who we are,

00:31:16.830 --> 00:31:18.247 align:middle line:10%
by the way.

00:31:18.247 --> 00:31:19.455 align:middle line:90%
I'm a big fan of Dostoyevsky.

00:31:19.455 --> 00:31:20.710 align:middle line:90%
He's one of my favorites.

00:31:20.710 --> 00:31:23.940 align:middle line:84%
And, you know, he always
pointed out, you give a man--

00:31:23.940 --> 00:31:25.170 align:middle line:90%
or you wouldn't say man.

00:31:25.170 --> 00:31:29.960 align:middle line:10%
You give a person enough
food, give them shelter--

00:31:29.960 --> 00:31:32.900 align:middle line:10%
the progressives, and Dostoevsky
is talking about this almost,

00:31:32.900 --> 00:31:35.060 align:middle line:10%
almost 200 years ago,
he said, they believe

00:31:35.060 --> 00:31:37.640 align:middle line:10%
that will make us all happy.

00:31:37.640 --> 00:31:43.100 align:middle line:10%
And I'm kind of with Dostoevsky
on this, because he's like, no.

00:31:43.100 --> 00:31:44.990 align:middle line:10%
Nothing makes us happy.

00:31:44.990 --> 00:31:48.020 align:middle line:10%
We are effed up
beyond imagining.

00:31:48.020 --> 00:31:49.920 align:middle line:10%
We can't help it.

00:31:49.920 --> 00:31:51.560 align:middle line:10%
We'll find a way.

00:31:51.560 --> 00:31:54.470 align:middle line:10%
We will find a
way to be unhappy.

00:31:54.470 --> 00:31:56.510 align:middle line:10%
We will find a way.

00:31:56.510 --> 00:31:59.800 align:middle line:10%
Anyway, my point is
I think that there's

00:31:59.800 --> 00:32:03.310 align:middle line:10%
something intrinsic in us.

00:32:03.310 --> 00:32:05.770 align:middle line:10%
I think the violence
is actually--

00:32:05.770 --> 00:32:08.650 align:middle line:10%
it's an evolutionary
intrinsic quality

00:32:08.650 --> 00:32:12.810 align:middle line:10%
that we had to have to survive.

00:32:12.810 --> 00:32:15.430 align:middle line:10%
And it's just too soon.

00:32:15.430 --> 00:32:16.950 align:middle line:10%
We can't get rid of it.

00:32:16.950 --> 00:32:18.040 align:middle line:10%
It's too soon.

00:32:18.040 --> 00:32:20.820 align:middle line:10%
We've-- we're just out of
the-- we're just out of that

00:32:20.820 --> 00:32:22.340 align:middle line:10%
environment.

00:32:22.340 --> 00:32:25.640 align:middle line:10%
And so here we are now
in this transformation

00:32:25.640 --> 00:32:28.260 align:middle line:10%
where we're all supposed to
go into our little cubby hole.

00:32:28.260 --> 00:32:29.060 align:middle line:10%
You do this.

00:32:29.060 --> 00:32:29.970 align:middle line:10%
You go do this.

00:32:29.970 --> 00:32:31.760 align:middle line:10%
You have to follow
this rule and that rule

00:32:31.760 --> 00:32:33.770 align:middle line:10%
and this bureaucracy
and this legal system.

00:32:33.770 --> 00:32:35.265 align:middle line:10%
And this is going
to be your job.

00:32:35.265 --> 00:32:36.890 align:middle line:10%
And you've got to
punch into the clock.

00:32:36.890 --> 00:32:39.350 align:middle line:10%
And you got to work for this
totalitarian corporation that's

00:32:39.350 --> 00:32:40.230 align:middle line:10%
going to monitor you.

00:32:40.230 --> 00:32:41.790 align:middle line:10%
And there you are.

00:32:41.790 --> 00:32:43.920 align:middle line:10%
And we're not going to do that.

00:32:43.920 --> 00:32:46.430 align:middle line:10%
You're going to-- Dostoevsky
is like, you think you're just

00:32:46.430 --> 00:32:48.140 align:middle line:10%
going to be like a
big, fat cow in a pen

00:32:48.140 --> 00:32:49.440 align:middle line:10%
and that's going
to make you happy?

00:32:49.440 --> 00:32:50.850 align:middle line:10%
That's not what
a human being is.

00:32:50.850 --> 00:32:52.470 align:middle line:10%
A human being is going to fight.

00:32:52.470 --> 00:32:54.350 align:middle line:10%
A human being is
going to say 2 plus 2

00:32:54.350 --> 00:32:55.940 align:middle line:10%
doesn't equal 4
because, damn it, I

00:32:55.940 --> 00:32:57.710 align:middle line:10%
don't want to believe that.

00:32:57.710 --> 00:33:00.240 align:middle line:10%
I'm going to make my own
answer to that question.

00:33:00.240 --> 00:33:02.880 align:middle line:10%
That's what we do, because
we just can't help it.

00:33:02.880 --> 00:33:07.580 align:middle line:10%
So we're moving into this
weird place as a society

00:33:07.580 --> 00:33:09.980 align:middle line:10%
and as a species and
every one of us as people.

00:33:09.980 --> 00:33:11.990 align:middle line:10%
And your children and
your grandchildren

00:33:11.990 --> 00:33:14.827 align:middle line:10%
and your great-grandchildren are
going to really be living this.

00:33:14.827 --> 00:33:16.160 align:middle line:10%
And how are they going to adapt?

00:33:16.160 --> 00:33:17.210 align:middle line:10%
You got me.

00:33:17.210 --> 00:33:18.800 align:middle line:90%
So where are we headed?

00:33:18.800 --> 00:33:21.590 align:middle line:84%
Well, we're headed toward
total rationalization

00:33:21.590 --> 00:33:22.660 align:middle line:90%
of human society.

00:33:22.660 --> 00:33:26.640 align:middle line:84%
That's what we're headed toward,
a complete, digitized control

00:33:26.640 --> 00:33:31.165 align:middle line:84%
system of absolute, total
organization, unless we

00:33:31.165 --> 00:33:33.790 align:middle line:84%
managed to screw it up, which,
you know, a good chance of that.

00:33:33.790 --> 00:33:38.320 align:middle line:10%
But that's what is--
that's our direction.

00:33:38.320 --> 00:33:40.770 align:middle line:10%
And we're being dragged into it.

00:33:40.770 --> 00:33:42.600 align:middle line:10%
That's what's happening.

00:33:42.600 --> 00:33:44.230 align:middle line:10%
But what about the aliens?

00:33:44.230 --> 00:33:47.470 align:middle line:84%
What about the UAP,
whoever they are?

00:33:47.470 --> 00:33:48.860 align:middle line:90%
Well, I wonder about this.

00:33:48.860 --> 00:33:51.190 align:middle line:84%
And you know again, I'm
only speculating what--

00:33:51.190 --> 00:33:52.100 align:middle line:90%
I can't know.

00:33:52.100 --> 00:33:53.590 align:middle line:90%
I haven't talked with them.

00:33:53.590 --> 00:33:56.560 align:middle line:84%
But I would say if they're
interested in working

00:33:56.560 --> 00:34:01.610 align:middle line:84%
with humanity in some way in the
future, what might they want?

00:34:01.610 --> 00:34:05.590 align:middle line:84%
Well, if they're the United
States, I write at the top here,

00:34:05.590 --> 00:34:07.610 align:middle line:84%
they would want centralized
global authority.

00:34:07.610 --> 00:34:09.070 align:middle line:84%
But if they're the United
States, they wouldn't.

00:34:09.070 --> 00:34:11.860 align:middle line:84%
They would want to break it
into 1,000 pieces and extract it

00:34:11.860 --> 00:34:14.802 align:middle line:84%
and eat it all up, because
that's the best way to gobble up

00:34:14.802 --> 00:34:16.010 align:middle line:90%
nations that they don't like.

00:34:16.010 --> 00:34:19.780 align:middle line:10%
But let's say that the
ETs aren't quite as

00:34:19.780 --> 00:34:22.420 align:middle line:10%
vicious as Washington is.

00:34:22.420 --> 00:34:29.010 align:middle line:10%
So they would want, perhaps, a
centralized global authority,

00:34:29.010 --> 00:34:29.940 align:middle line:10%
because it's easier.

00:34:29.940 --> 00:34:32.780 align:middle line:10%
If you're a purchasing agent,
you don't want 2,000 vendors

00:34:32.780 --> 00:34:33.580 align:middle line:10%
to deal with you.

00:34:33.580 --> 00:34:37.056 align:middle line:10%
You want a couple, maybe one
that you can control, too.

00:34:37.056 --> 00:34:38.139 align:middle line:10%
That would be a good idea.

00:34:38.139 --> 00:34:42.270 align:middle line:10%
So they would want a centralized
system, probably what they have.

00:34:42.270 --> 00:34:43.389 align:middle line:10%
Probably.

00:34:43.389 --> 00:34:44.949 align:middle line:10%
And that's better.

00:34:44.949 --> 00:34:47.639 align:middle line:10%
So they might
actually be pretty OK

00:34:47.639 --> 00:34:53.409 align:middle line:10%
with this transformation of
our world, quite possibly.

00:34:53.409 --> 00:34:55.060 align:middle line:10%
Quite possibly they would.

00:34:55.060 --> 00:34:56.770 align:middle line:10%
Again, I'm just speculating.

00:34:56.770 --> 00:34:59.820 align:middle line:84%
And by the way, I'm
treating these beings

00:34:59.820 --> 00:35:03.960 align:middle line:84%
as physical entities
with bodies,

00:35:03.960 --> 00:35:05.670 align:middle line:84%
because that's what
I believe they are.

00:35:05.670 --> 00:35:07.770 align:middle line:84%
I'm not saying
that they're not--

00:35:07.770 --> 00:35:12.100 align:middle line:84%
that there's not a psychic and
spiritual dimension to this.

00:35:12.100 --> 00:35:14.110 align:middle line:90%
I have my own spirituality.

00:35:14.110 --> 00:35:16.020 align:middle line:90%
It's very important to me.

00:35:16.020 --> 00:35:20.450 align:middle line:10%
But when I look at the
entities, I look at the craft,

00:35:20.450 --> 00:35:23.600 align:middle line:10%
I see technology, I
see material objects,

00:35:23.600 --> 00:35:30.050 align:middle line:10%
and I see beings
that are mortal.

00:35:30.050 --> 00:35:33.230 align:middle line:10%
I mean, maybe they live a
longer time than we do, but--

00:35:33.230 --> 00:35:35.330 align:middle line:10%
so I see them as--

00:35:35.330 --> 00:35:41.840 align:middle line:10%
I see them as beings that have
their needs, their desires,

00:35:41.840 --> 00:35:46.650 align:middle line:10%
their volition, things that
they want, just like we do.

00:35:46.650 --> 00:35:49.198 align:middle line:10%
And, you know, the
art of diplomacy,

00:35:49.198 --> 00:35:51.240 align:middle line:10%
which the United States
has long since forgotten.

00:35:51.240 --> 00:35:52.700 align:middle line:10%
But the art of
diplomacy is the art

00:35:52.700 --> 00:35:55.280 align:middle line:10%
of understanding the other
guy and understanding

00:35:55.280 --> 00:35:56.700 align:middle line:10%
what they want.

00:35:56.700 --> 00:35:58.410 align:middle line:10%
And you work it out.

00:35:58.410 --> 00:36:00.530 align:middle line:10%
You just work things out.

00:36:00.530 --> 00:36:02.180 align:middle line:10%
I think that's-- if--

00:36:02.180 --> 00:36:03.710 align:middle line:10%
under the best
circumstances, that's

00:36:03.710 --> 00:36:06.500 align:middle line:10%
probably what they would want.

00:36:06.500 --> 00:36:09.380 align:middle line:10%
So a centralized system,
I could see that easily.

00:36:09.380 --> 00:36:12.600 align:middle line:10%
One that they would influence
probably, I would imagine.

00:36:12.600 --> 00:36:15.135 align:middle line:10%
Why wouldn't they want to
influence us or control?

00:36:15.135 --> 00:36:17.510 align:middle line:10%
I mean, look, I'm not going
to go down this road tonight,

00:36:17.510 --> 00:36:22.100 align:middle line:10%
but there's always been claims
from various insiders, this one,

00:36:22.100 --> 00:36:25.930 align:middle line:10%
that one, that there's
collaboration between us

00:36:25.930 --> 00:36:27.350 align:middle line:10%
and them at various levels.

00:36:27.350 --> 00:36:30.580 align:middle line:10%
And why would that be
so difficult to believe?

00:36:30.580 --> 00:36:32.807 align:middle line:10%
It's not difficult
to believe at all.

00:36:32.807 --> 00:36:34.390 align:middle line:10%
Proving it will be
a different matter,

00:36:34.390 --> 00:36:36.550 align:middle line:10%
but it's not difficult
for me to believe.

00:36:36.550 --> 00:36:39.640 align:middle line:10%
They would also want
control over the population.

00:36:39.640 --> 00:36:40.640 align:middle line:90%
Let's get real here.

00:36:40.640 --> 00:36:41.440 align:middle line:90%
They would.

00:36:41.440 --> 00:36:44.530 align:middle line:84%
They don't want--
if you're engaged

00:36:44.530 --> 00:36:47.782 align:middle line:84%
in a relationship with
another world or society,

00:36:47.782 --> 00:36:49.990 align:middle line:84%
you don't want it to be in
a constant state of unrest

00:36:49.990 --> 00:36:53.780 align:middle line:84%
and, you know, maybe on the
verge of some revolution.

00:36:53.780 --> 00:36:55.880 align:middle line:84%
You're like, we want
you to chill out.

00:36:55.880 --> 00:36:58.220 align:middle line:84%
So you need to get
control over your people.

00:36:58.220 --> 00:36:59.530 align:middle line:90%
I could easily see that.

00:36:59.530 --> 00:37:01.990 align:middle line:10%
They would probably want a
certain technological level

00:37:01.990 --> 00:37:04.630 align:middle line:10%
for humanity, because if
you want to play the game,

00:37:04.630 --> 00:37:07.160 align:middle line:10%
you've got to have certain
amount of technology and toys

00:37:07.160 --> 00:37:07.960 align:middle line:10%
to do it.

00:37:07.960 --> 00:37:09.610 align:middle line:10%
And they probably
would want that.

00:37:09.610 --> 00:37:14.380 align:middle line:84%
And they would want, ultimately,
a highly rationalized society,

00:37:14.380 --> 00:37:15.530 align:middle line:90%
which is what they have.

00:37:15.530 --> 00:37:17.080 align:middle line:90%
I say rationalized.

00:37:17.080 --> 00:37:18.730 align:middle line:10%
Many thousands of
years ago, I used

00:37:18.730 --> 00:37:21.100 align:middle line:10%
to read Max Weber,
the great sociologist.

00:37:21.100 --> 00:37:23.530 align:middle line:10%
And that was his thing,
the rationalization

00:37:23.530 --> 00:37:24.650 align:middle line:10%
of human society.

00:37:24.650 --> 00:37:26.760 align:middle line:10%
He's writing about
this 100 years ago.

00:37:26.760 --> 00:37:28.990 align:middle line:10%
He was right on the money,
knew exactly what he

00:37:28.990 --> 00:37:29.790 align:middle line:10%
was talking about.

00:37:29.790 --> 00:37:33.730 align:middle line:10%
He said, human society is
rationalizing, which it was,

00:37:33.730 --> 00:37:34.545 align:middle line:10%
even 100 years ago.

00:37:34.545 --> 00:37:36.170 align:middle line:10%
So I think that's
what they would want.

00:37:36.170 --> 00:37:37.100 align:middle line:10%
That's my belief.

00:37:37.100 --> 00:37:39.490 align:middle line:10%
The preferred outcome for the
establishment, pretty much

00:37:39.490 --> 00:37:40.310 align:middle line:10%
the same.

00:37:40.310 --> 00:37:43.362 align:middle line:10%
They want the complete,
the global revolution.

00:37:43.362 --> 00:37:44.570 align:middle line:10%
Again, I'm going to say this.

00:37:44.570 --> 00:37:47.110 align:middle line:10%
There is a global revolution
happening right now.

00:37:47.110 --> 00:37:49.450 align:middle line:84%
It's not under that
name, because that

00:37:49.450 --> 00:37:50.800 align:middle line:90%
would be bad for marketing.

00:37:50.800 --> 00:37:52.310 align:middle line:90%
But that's what it is.

00:37:52.310 --> 00:37:55.870 align:middle line:84%
It is a global,
centrally-directed, top-down

00:37:55.870 --> 00:37:58.310 align:middle line:90%
revolution by visionaries.

00:37:58.310 --> 00:38:01.700 align:middle line:10%
I don't like their vision at
all, but they are visionaries.

00:38:01.700 --> 00:38:03.580 align:middle line:10%
They have direction,
so they want

00:38:03.580 --> 00:38:05.110 align:middle line:10%
to complete the
global revolution.

00:38:05.110 --> 00:38:07.630 align:middle line:10%
So they want to complete
this digital control

00:38:07.630 --> 00:38:10.927 align:middle line:10%
system, which is not--
it's not done yet,

00:38:10.927 --> 00:38:12.010 align:middle line:10%
but they're working on it.

00:38:12.010 --> 00:38:14.343 align:middle line:10%
And they're doing a pretty
good job at making it happen.

00:38:14.343 --> 00:38:16.280 align:middle line:10%
They want to lock down
ideas they don't like.

00:38:16.280 --> 00:38:18.405 align:middle line:10%
They want to lock down
discussions they don't like.

00:38:18.405 --> 00:38:22.600 align:middle line:10%
Yep, they're working on that,
and in which the UFO or UAP

00:38:22.600 --> 00:38:26.860 align:middle line:10%
situation is thoroughly
curated and managed.

00:38:26.860 --> 00:38:30.700 align:middle line:90%
So no conspiracy is allowed.

00:38:30.700 --> 00:38:36.450 align:middle line:84%
And we're going to get into
now the problem with that,

00:38:36.450 --> 00:38:41.400 align:middle line:84%
because there is a war within
the national security state.

00:38:41.400 --> 00:38:44.160 align:middle line:10%
There's a war going on
right now, a battle.

00:38:44.160 --> 00:38:44.980 align:middle line:10%
That's a war.

00:38:44.980 --> 00:38:49.020 align:middle line:10%
The point is that there are
crises happening everywhere

00:38:49.020 --> 00:38:50.400 align:middle line:10%
you look.

00:38:50.400 --> 00:38:54.720 align:middle line:84%
And it is not only the UFO,
UAP problem that is a crisis.

00:38:54.720 --> 00:38:59.340 align:middle line:10%
There's a lot of unhappiness
within the national security

00:38:59.340 --> 00:39:00.498 align:middle line:10%
planners right now.

00:39:00.498 --> 00:39:02.040 align:middle line:10%
No one's talking
about it, because we

00:39:02.040 --> 00:39:05.520 align:middle line:10%
have a dishonest system
that doesn't report it.

00:39:05.520 --> 00:39:07.130 align:middle line:10%
But it's the fact.

00:39:07.130 --> 00:39:09.620 align:middle line:10%
But UAP disclosure is one.

00:39:09.620 --> 00:39:15.670 align:middle line:10%
We're looking at an
insurgency within the system.

00:39:15.670 --> 00:39:17.500 align:middle line:10%
One insider a
couple of years ago

00:39:17.500 --> 00:39:21.100 align:middle line:10%
said, well, it's just a bunch
of toothpaste out of the tube.

00:39:21.100 --> 00:39:23.300 align:middle line:90%
Very laconically said that.

00:39:23.300 --> 00:39:25.340 align:middle line:84%
Can the toothpaste
be put back in?

00:39:25.340 --> 00:39:26.140 align:middle line:90%
Maybe.

00:39:26.140 --> 00:39:27.610 align:middle line:90%
I don't know.

00:39:27.610 --> 00:39:31.900 align:middle line:84%
So, Grusch, you know, last
July, he's talking to Congress.

00:39:31.900 --> 00:39:34.420 align:middle line:84%
And he's talking about the
existence of crashed UFOs.

00:39:34.420 --> 00:39:36.680 align:middle line:84%
He's talking about the
non-human biologics.

00:39:36.680 --> 00:39:39.310 align:middle line:84%
He's talking about reverse
engineering programs

00:39:39.310 --> 00:39:41.270 align:middle line:90%
to Congress in session.

00:39:41.270 --> 00:39:44.260 align:middle line:84%
He's talking about the extreme
secrecy and compartmentalization

00:39:44.260 --> 00:39:47.020 align:middle line:84%
in which people have
died and been killed

00:39:47.020 --> 00:39:49.730 align:middle line:84%
and the need for
transparency and disclosure.

00:39:49.730 --> 00:39:53.320 align:middle line:10%
He said all of those things
to members of Congress

00:39:53.320 --> 00:39:56.550 align:middle line:10%
and a little bit of media
attention, a little bit.

00:39:56.550 --> 00:39:59.080 align:middle line:10%
You got the Schumer Amendment
to the NDAA coming up.

00:39:59.080 --> 00:40:00.460 align:middle line:10%
And I'm sure that'll be signed.

00:40:00.460 --> 00:40:02.590 align:middle line:10%
And I'm not going to
get into all of us.

00:40:02.590 --> 00:40:03.720 align:middle line:10%
Take a screenshot.

00:40:03.720 --> 00:40:05.980 align:middle line:10%
That's actually a
pretty good assessment

00:40:05.980 --> 00:40:07.710 align:middle line:10%
of everything in there.

00:40:07.710 --> 00:40:09.900 align:middle line:10%
I actually gone through it.

00:40:09.900 --> 00:40:10.700 align:middle line:10%
It's not fun.

00:40:10.700 --> 00:40:12.492 align:middle line:10%
It's difficult. I'm
sure Danny, who's here,

00:40:12.492 --> 00:40:13.990 align:middle line:10%
has read it even better than me.

00:40:13.990 --> 00:40:15.880 align:middle line:10%
And I see I misspelled
the word amendment.

00:40:15.880 --> 00:40:16.680 align:middle line:10%
OK, whatever.

00:40:16.680 --> 00:40:21.410 align:middle line:10%
So it's to create the
UAP records collection,

00:40:21.410 --> 00:40:23.960 align:middle line:10%
presume immediate
disclosure of UAP records

00:40:23.960 --> 00:40:27.410 align:middle line:10%
from various places, mandatory
review of the records

00:40:27.410 --> 00:40:30.440 align:middle line:10%
by government offices,
establishment of the records

00:40:30.440 --> 00:40:33.860 align:middle line:10%
review board, public
disclosure or postponement

00:40:33.860 --> 00:40:35.010 align:middle line:10%
based on clear evidence.

00:40:35.010 --> 00:40:37.890 align:middle line:10%
In other words, the
evidence has to be released.

00:40:37.890 --> 00:40:40.640 align:middle line:10%
And if it's not released, you
have to tell the public why.

00:40:40.640 --> 00:40:45.260 align:middle line:10%
And then you are obligated
to review that periodically

00:40:45.260 --> 00:40:47.600 align:middle line:10%
for review.

00:40:47.600 --> 00:40:50.130 align:middle line:84%
Protection of
whistleblowers is in there.

00:40:50.130 --> 00:40:54.650 align:middle line:10%
And one of the more
interesting things

00:40:54.650 --> 00:40:58.310 align:middle line:10%
is its attitude toward
private corporations, defense

00:40:58.310 --> 00:41:00.470 align:middle line:10%
contractors, where it says--

00:41:00.470 --> 00:41:01.610 align:middle line:10%
now, this is--

00:41:01.610 --> 00:41:03.740 align:middle line:10%
I don't-- Danny can talk
about this better than I,

00:41:03.740 --> 00:41:04.740 align:middle line:10%
and I'm sure he will.

00:41:04.740 --> 00:41:07.110 align:middle line:10%
How strong is this provision?

00:41:07.110 --> 00:41:09.830 align:middle line:10%
I'm not-- it doesn't
seem watertight to me

00:41:09.830 --> 00:41:12.170 align:middle line:10%
that UAP records from
private entities,

00:41:12.170 --> 00:41:15.890 align:middle line:10%
basically Lockheed and
the rest, should not

00:41:15.890 --> 00:41:18.373 align:middle line:10%
be withheld or redacted.

00:41:18.373 --> 00:41:19.790 align:middle line:84%
I don't see anywhere
where they're

00:41:19.790 --> 00:41:21.082 align:middle line:90%
mandated to give that stuff up.

00:41:21.082 --> 00:41:23.665 align:middle line:84%
Some people were saying in the
beginning that that's the case,

00:41:23.665 --> 00:41:24.590 align:middle line:90%
and I don't see that.

00:41:24.590 --> 00:41:26.480 align:middle line:84%
Private corporations
with federal contracts

00:41:26.480 --> 00:41:30.800 align:middle line:84%
are encouraged to disclose
their UAP records.

00:41:30.800 --> 00:41:34.550 align:middle line:84%
There is a subpoena power
that the review board has,

00:41:34.550 --> 00:41:36.210 align:middle line:90%
so that's good.

00:41:36.210 --> 00:41:37.010 align:middle line:84%
Now, you're gonna see
how are they going

00:41:37.010 --> 00:41:38.135 align:middle line:90%
to use that subpoena power?

00:41:38.135 --> 00:41:39.440 align:middle line:90%
Maybe.

00:41:39.440 --> 00:41:40.980 align:middle line:90%
Likelihood of success.

00:41:40.980 --> 00:41:42.630 align:middle line:90%
Here's how it can succeed.

00:41:42.630 --> 00:41:45.950 align:middle line:90%
And I believe this is possible.

00:41:45.950 --> 00:41:47.940 align:middle line:10%
A lot more witnesses
come forward.

00:41:47.940 --> 00:41:49.217 align:middle line:10%
The grapevine is out there.

00:41:49.217 --> 00:41:51.050 align:middle line:10%
I don't know if what
I'm hearing is correct,

00:41:51.050 --> 00:41:52.580 align:middle line:10%
but I think it's
probably correct

00:41:52.580 --> 00:41:55.860 align:middle line:10%
that there's more, more than
Grusch, is out there, more

00:41:55.860 --> 00:41:56.660 align:middle line:10%
to come.

00:41:56.660 --> 00:41:59.680 align:middle line:84%
And maybe more
powerful than Grusch.

00:41:59.680 --> 00:42:00.930 align:middle line:10%
Maybe better.

00:42:00.930 --> 00:42:03.650 align:middle line:10%
What Grusch had to say
was definitely powerful

00:42:03.650 --> 00:42:05.360 align:middle line:10%
and definitely noteworthy.

00:42:05.360 --> 00:42:06.470 align:middle line:10%
Absolutely.

00:42:06.470 --> 00:42:08.180 align:middle line:10%
Absolutely.

00:42:08.180 --> 00:42:09.860 align:middle line:10%
And there are more.

00:42:09.860 --> 00:42:10.880 align:middle line:10%
And I'm certain.

00:42:10.880 --> 00:42:12.230 align:middle line:10%
I know that there are more.

00:42:12.230 --> 00:42:13.650 align:middle line:90%
Will they come forward?

00:42:13.650 --> 00:42:16.050 align:middle line:84%
Will they be as
explosive as he will?

00:42:16.050 --> 00:42:17.000 align:middle line:90%
They probably will be.

00:42:17.000 --> 00:42:17.940 align:middle line:90%
Good chance.

00:42:17.940 --> 00:42:19.907 align:middle line:90%
Will that make a difference?

00:42:19.907 --> 00:42:20.990 align:middle line:90%
There's the real question.

00:42:20.990 --> 00:42:23.720 align:middle line:10%
Will they get a support from
the establishment media,

00:42:23.720 --> 00:42:26.630 align:middle line:10%
which is part of the war?

00:42:26.630 --> 00:42:28.410 align:middle line:10%
The media is not independent.

00:42:28.410 --> 00:42:31.260 align:middle line:10%
The media is an arm of the
national security state.

00:42:31.260 --> 00:42:35.000 align:middle line:10%
And the question is, what
parts of the major media

00:42:35.000 --> 00:42:37.110 align:middle line:10%
are going to side
with the insurgency?

00:42:37.110 --> 00:42:39.740 align:middle line:10%
And I don't see.

00:42:39.740 --> 00:42:41.910 align:middle line:10%
Maybe I'm not in every
loop, I'm certainly not.

00:42:41.910 --> 00:42:44.190 align:middle line:10%
But will they
actually do their job?

00:42:44.190 --> 00:42:46.350 align:middle line:10%
That's a really
important question.

00:42:46.350 --> 00:42:49.040 align:middle line:10%
And is there enough will
among the members of congress,

00:42:49.040 --> 00:42:52.550 align:middle line:10%
particularly moving forward
into a year that I believe

00:42:52.550 --> 00:42:56.670 align:middle line:10%
will be a very tumultuous
2024 on every level?

00:42:56.670 --> 00:42:59.570 align:middle line:84%
There's going to be a lot of
things going on in this world

00:42:59.570 --> 00:43:03.410 align:middle line:84%
to take people's eye
off the ball of UAP.

00:43:03.410 --> 00:43:04.490 align:middle line:90%
A lot.

00:43:04.490 --> 00:43:06.750 align:middle line:10%
A lot can really go really bad.

00:43:06.750 --> 00:43:10.238 align:middle line:10%
So that's success, if we
get the whistleblower.

00:43:10.238 --> 00:43:11.780 align:middle line:10%
Obstacles, well,
there's always going

00:43:11.780 --> 00:43:13.670 align:middle line:10%
to be obstruction
from the insiders

00:43:13.670 --> 00:43:14.970 align:middle line:10%
and from the media allies.

00:43:14.970 --> 00:43:15.770 align:middle line:10%
Absolutely.

00:43:15.770 --> 00:43:18.570 align:middle line:84%
Declassification of information,
Grusch talked about this.

00:43:18.570 --> 00:43:20.040 align:middle line:84%
We've known about
this for years.

00:43:20.040 --> 00:43:21.450 align:middle line:90%
Can you get to this stuff?

00:43:21.450 --> 00:43:24.050 align:middle line:10%
Can you-- you know, I talked
about the Wilson-Davis notes

00:43:24.050 --> 00:43:25.200 align:middle line:10%
for the longest time.

00:43:25.200 --> 00:43:27.770 align:middle line:10%
For a while, I was the
only one defending those--

00:43:27.770 --> 00:43:29.130 align:middle line:10%
that document publicly.

00:43:29.130 --> 00:43:30.920 align:middle line:10%
And of course, it's legitimate.

00:43:30.920 --> 00:43:32.600 align:middle line:10%
And in that, if
you read, you will

00:43:32.600 --> 00:43:36.090 align:middle line:10%
see that this is
difficult stuff to get to.

00:43:36.090 --> 00:43:39.620 align:middle line:10%
This is hidden away within
special access programs,

00:43:39.620 --> 00:43:44.490 align:middle line:10%
buried, buried, buried
within Pentagon, CIA, and DOE

00:43:44.490 --> 00:43:45.843 align:middle line:10%
at a minimum.

00:43:45.843 --> 00:43:47.510 align:middle line:10%
No one talks about
Department of Energy.

00:43:47.510 --> 00:43:49.730 align:middle line:10%
And guarantee they
got a lot there.

00:43:49.730 --> 00:43:50.610 align:middle line:90%
So there's that.

00:43:50.610 --> 00:43:52.027 align:middle line:84%
And then, you know,
any new crisis

00:43:52.027 --> 00:43:56.000 align:middle line:84%
that comes along the way
to just slam down the lid.

00:43:56.000 --> 00:44:00.370 align:middle line:84%
What needs to be addressed
and won't be probably.

00:44:00.370 --> 00:44:03.370 align:middle line:84%
The true scale of UAP activity
that I've talked about,

00:44:03.370 --> 00:44:04.710 align:middle line:90%
the thousands and thousands.

00:44:04.710 --> 00:44:05.690 align:middle line:90%
What's going on here?

00:44:05.690 --> 00:44:07.720 align:middle line:90%
What are they doing?

00:44:07.720 --> 00:44:09.760 align:middle line:90%
What are they doing?

00:44:09.760 --> 00:44:12.320 align:middle line:84%
How long have they
been tracking us?

00:44:12.320 --> 00:44:14.820 align:middle line:84%
How has the secrecy been
organized all this time?

00:44:14.820 --> 00:44:16.070 align:middle line:90%
Who's been running this thing?

00:44:16.070 --> 00:44:17.537 align:middle line:10%
How have they been
able to subvert

00:44:17.537 --> 00:44:19.120 align:middle line:10%
our political
institutions, our media,

00:44:19.120 --> 00:44:21.100 align:middle line:10%
our academic institutions?

00:44:21.100 --> 00:44:23.290 align:middle line:10%
Because they've
been subverted, too.

00:44:23.290 --> 00:44:24.873 align:middle line:10%
What's the military
dimension of this?

00:44:24.873 --> 00:44:26.665 align:middle line:10%
I told you about how
these things shut down

00:44:26.665 --> 00:44:27.620 align:middle line:10%
aircraft carriers.

00:44:27.620 --> 00:44:28.530 align:middle line:10%
That's no joke.

00:44:28.530 --> 00:44:29.330 align:middle line:10%
They do that.

00:44:29.330 --> 00:44:31.160 align:middle line:10%
They-- I'm sure they do more.

00:44:31.160 --> 00:44:33.550 align:middle line:10%
We want to know about this.

00:44:33.550 --> 00:44:36.980 align:middle line:10%
What materials and biologics
have been acquired?

00:44:36.980 --> 00:44:39.027 align:middle line:10%
What have we learned in secret?

00:44:39.027 --> 00:44:41.110 align:middle line:10%
Are we ever going to really
get the truth on this?

00:44:41.110 --> 00:44:42.527 align:middle line:10%
Or are we just
going to run around

00:44:42.527 --> 00:44:45.990 align:middle line:10%
in this little game of pretend,
which we're doing currently?

00:44:45.990 --> 00:44:47.740 align:middle line:10%
The Pentagon's like,
well, we'll get back.

00:44:47.740 --> 00:44:48.770 align:middle line:10%
We're going to learn it.

00:44:48.770 --> 00:44:51.353 align:middle line:10%
We're going to study this, and
we're going to get back to you.

00:44:51.353 --> 00:44:52.840 align:middle line:10%
And OK, great.

00:44:52.840 --> 00:44:55.280 align:middle line:10%
And how can people
know what's true?

00:44:55.280 --> 00:44:57.320 align:middle line:10%
How can we know what's true?

00:44:57.320 --> 00:44:59.900 align:middle line:90%
How can we open our eyes?

00:44:59.900 --> 00:45:01.840 align:middle line:90%
Do people really even care?

00:45:01.840 --> 00:45:04.317 align:middle line:84%
You've got family, you got
relatives, you got friends.

00:45:04.317 --> 00:45:05.900 align:middle line:10%
You know, you talk
to them about this.

00:45:05.900 --> 00:45:07.720 align:middle line:10%
They're like, oh,
very interesting.

00:45:07.720 --> 00:45:09.855 align:middle line:10%
Hey, I watched the
Buffalo Bills last night.

00:45:09.855 --> 00:45:10.730 align:middle line:10%
They had a good game.

00:45:10.730 --> 00:45:12.320 align:middle line:10%
And that's how people are.

00:45:12.320 --> 00:45:14.340 align:middle line:10%
And maybe that's how
we're supposed to be.

00:45:14.340 --> 00:45:15.140 align:middle line:10%
I don't know.

00:45:15.140 --> 00:45:17.780 align:middle line:10%
Is our political system
up to this challenge?

00:45:17.780 --> 00:45:19.180 align:middle line:10%
Ask yourself.

00:45:19.180 --> 00:45:20.720 align:middle line:10%
Are we really up to it?

00:45:20.720 --> 00:45:22.290 align:middle line:10%
Is our society?

00:45:22.290 --> 00:45:25.690 align:middle line:10%
My last slide is here.

00:45:25.690 --> 00:45:30.090 align:middle line:84%
And I'm not going to
cut this last slide.

00:45:30.090 --> 00:45:32.040 align:middle line:90%
This is my personal view.

00:45:32.040 --> 00:45:34.770 align:middle line:84%
I have been accused,
often rightly,

00:45:34.770 --> 00:45:37.570 align:middle line:90%
of being ultra black pilled.

00:45:37.570 --> 00:45:39.250 align:middle line:84%
You know, you've
heard of the red pill.

00:45:39.250 --> 00:45:40.542 align:middle line:90%
You've probably heard of black.

00:45:40.542 --> 00:45:43.030 align:middle line:84%
Red pills, here's the
truth if you can handle it.

00:45:43.030 --> 00:45:44.760 align:middle line:10%
The black pill is
like, here's the truth

00:45:44.760 --> 00:45:46.170 align:middle line:10%
and put your head between
your knees and kiss

00:45:46.170 --> 00:45:47.242 align:middle line:10%
your butt goodbye.

00:45:47.242 --> 00:45:49.200 align:middle line:10%
And I'm black pilled
about half the time, so it

00:45:49.200 --> 00:45:50.492 align:middle line:10%
depends on the day of the week.

00:45:50.492 --> 00:45:53.120 align:middle line:10%
Fortunately, I was black pilled
yesterday, so today, I'm good.

00:45:53.120 --> 00:45:55.890 align:middle line:10%
I'm a dark red pill.

00:45:55.890 --> 00:46:01.830 align:middle line:84%
I will say that I look
at my life in this field.

00:46:01.830 --> 00:46:03.420 align:middle line:84%
I've been doing this
for now 30 years.

00:46:03.420 --> 00:46:06.350 align:middle line:10%
I've studied this
and been public

00:46:06.350 --> 00:46:10.760 align:middle line:10%
in this field for almost that
long, about 25 years, I guess.

00:46:10.760 --> 00:46:12.200 align:middle line:10%
Almost.

00:46:12.200 --> 00:46:15.210 align:middle line:10%
I've gone on my own life
journey in this subject.

00:46:15.210 --> 00:46:18.830 align:middle line:10%
And I started out, you know,
in the '90s studying this,

00:46:18.830 --> 00:46:23.520 align:middle line:10%
thinking, I want to see about
ending this UFO cover up.

00:46:23.520 --> 00:46:26.520 align:middle line:10%
I believe that this is right.

00:46:26.520 --> 00:46:27.870 align:middle line:10%
We need to get to the truth.

00:46:27.870 --> 00:46:33.760 align:middle line:10%
The truth needs to be
exposed because it's right,

00:46:33.760 --> 00:46:37.950 align:middle line:10%
because the truth is this
precious commodity that

00:46:37.950 --> 00:46:39.130 align:middle line:10%
is all too lacking.

00:46:39.130 --> 00:46:41.950 align:middle line:10%
And there's something
very big here.

00:46:41.950 --> 00:46:44.817 align:middle line:10%
And we need-- and we don't
want to live in a society

00:46:44.817 --> 00:46:47.400 align:middle line:10%
where we're being lied to and
treated like we're kindergartens

00:46:47.400 --> 00:46:49.770 align:middle line:10%
and being spoon fed BS
for the rest of our lives.

00:46:49.770 --> 00:46:51.660 align:middle line:10%
We deserve better,
because we're free people

00:46:51.660 --> 00:46:53.860 align:middle line:10%
and we're free citizens
and in a republic.

00:46:53.860 --> 00:46:55.322 align:middle line:10%
And that was my attitude.

00:46:55.322 --> 00:46:56.280 align:middle line:10%
It's still my attitude.

00:46:56.280 --> 00:47:00.840 align:middle line:10%
However, that youthful idealism
gets tempered by pragmatism.

00:47:00.840 --> 00:47:03.660 align:middle line:10%
And you learn as you go
through life the world does not

00:47:03.660 --> 00:47:04.708 align:middle line:10%
follow your ideals.

00:47:04.708 --> 00:47:07.000 align:middle line:10%
And the world doesn't work
the way you want it to work.

00:47:07.000 --> 00:47:09.040 align:middle line:10%
There's what we want
and there's what is.

00:47:09.040 --> 00:47:10.620 align:middle line:10%
They are not the same.

00:47:10.620 --> 00:47:12.930 align:middle line:10%
And that doesn't mean
we give up those ideals,

00:47:12.930 --> 00:47:17.040 align:middle line:10%
but we must recognize reality.

00:47:17.040 --> 00:47:18.020 align:middle line:10%
I'm not a utopian.

00:47:18.020 --> 00:47:19.020 align:middle line:10%
I say this all the time.

00:47:19.020 --> 00:47:21.460 align:middle line:10%
I don't even like to hang
out with utopians anymore.

00:47:21.460 --> 00:47:22.390 align:middle line:10%
They scare me.

00:47:22.390 --> 00:47:23.440 align:middle line:10%
I don't believe in them.

00:47:23.440 --> 00:47:25.880 align:middle line:10%
I think they're--
actually, it's dangerous.

00:47:25.880 --> 00:47:27.720 align:middle line:10%
Doesn't mean you
don't have ideals.

00:47:27.720 --> 00:47:29.260 align:middle line:10%
So why am I talking about this?

00:47:29.260 --> 00:47:31.920 align:middle line:10%
Because when I
started to realize

00:47:31.920 --> 00:47:34.980 align:middle line:10%
that the world and the UFO
world wasn't according itself

00:47:34.980 --> 00:47:39.120 align:middle line:10%
to my wishes, I
thought, well, do

00:47:39.120 --> 00:47:40.970 align:middle line:10%
I want to get
depressed about that?

00:47:40.970 --> 00:47:41.770 align:middle line:90%
I don't know.

00:47:41.770 --> 00:47:42.728 align:middle line:90%
I didn't get depressed.

00:47:42.728 --> 00:47:45.030 align:middle line:84%
What I ended up doing, I
realized now, is I went--

00:47:45.030 --> 00:47:47.610 align:middle line:90%
I kind of went inside.

00:47:47.610 --> 00:47:49.230 align:middle line:10%
You know, there's an old saying.

00:47:49.230 --> 00:47:50.430 align:middle line:10%
You want an empire?

00:47:50.430 --> 00:47:52.910 align:middle line:10%
Conquer yourself.

00:47:52.910 --> 00:47:54.980 align:middle line:10%
It's from a Roman.

00:47:54.980 --> 00:47:56.170 align:middle line:10%
It's true.

00:47:56.170 --> 00:47:57.870 align:middle line:10%
It's the ultimate journey.

00:47:57.870 --> 00:48:01.970 align:middle line:10%
And so for me, what I realize is
that my journey in this subject,

00:48:01.970 --> 00:48:05.030 align:middle line:10%
and this is your journey,
too, toward that truth

00:48:05.030 --> 00:48:06.690 align:middle line:10%
is a transformation
of who you are.

00:48:06.690 --> 00:48:08.250 align:middle line:10%
It's a transformation
of who I am.

00:48:08.250 --> 00:48:09.390 align:middle line:10%
I'm not the same person.

00:48:09.390 --> 00:48:12.710 align:middle line:10%
This battle, this
battle for truth

00:48:12.710 --> 00:48:17.230 align:middle line:10%
has changed me as I
know it has changed you.

00:48:17.230 --> 00:48:19.900 align:middle line:84%
And I'm not saying that's
the great booby prize

00:48:19.900 --> 00:48:22.580 align:middle line:84%
and the world still sucks
and I'm a better person.

00:48:22.580 --> 00:48:27.640 align:middle line:84%
But the bottom line is
you go through your life

00:48:27.640 --> 00:48:30.050 align:middle line:84%
and you have to
live with yourself.

00:48:30.050 --> 00:48:33.860 align:middle line:10%
And the question is, what kind
of self are you going to be?

00:48:33.860 --> 00:48:38.870 align:middle line:10%
So we're citizens of a country.

00:48:38.870 --> 00:48:44.030 align:middle line:10%
We're citizens of the world.

00:48:44.030 --> 00:48:47.680 align:middle line:10%
We're citizens, you can
say, of the universe.

00:48:47.680 --> 00:48:52.940 align:middle line:10%
And you could say we're citizens
of the divine, which I believe.

00:48:52.940 --> 00:48:54.530 align:middle line:10%
We're all of those.

00:48:54.530 --> 00:48:59.870 align:middle line:10%
But you are-- you are also
a sovereign of yourself.

00:48:59.870 --> 00:49:04.640 align:middle line:10%
And it is up to
you and me for us

00:49:04.640 --> 00:49:07.070 align:middle line:10%
to make this decision
in this field

00:49:07.070 --> 00:49:10.620 align:middle line:10%
and in all aspects of our
life to seek the truth.

00:49:10.620 --> 00:49:11.910 align:middle line:10%
It sounds so simple.

00:49:11.910 --> 00:49:16.640 align:middle line:10%
It's so difficult. I've
had so many advantages.

00:49:16.640 --> 00:49:20.780 align:middle line:10%
You know, I did well in
my studies and university.

00:49:20.780 --> 00:49:23.600 align:middle line:10%
And I studied a lot of history.

00:49:23.600 --> 00:49:25.770 align:middle line:10%
And I've been
fanatical about it.

00:49:25.770 --> 00:49:28.340 align:middle line:10%
And I've been able to work
for myself, an advantage

00:49:28.340 --> 00:49:29.580 align:middle line:10%
that many people don't have.

00:49:29.580 --> 00:49:31.790 align:middle line:10%
And it's still hard for me.

00:49:31.790 --> 00:49:33.330 align:middle line:10%
It's still hard for me.

00:49:33.330 --> 00:49:38.180 align:middle line:10%
It's taken me years to
penetrate the layers of lies

00:49:38.180 --> 00:49:41.060 align:middle line:10%
that envelop us.

00:49:41.060 --> 00:49:43.110 align:middle line:10%
But we all can do it.

00:49:43.110 --> 00:49:46.290 align:middle line:10%
And it's the most worthy thing
that I feel we can still do.

00:49:46.290 --> 00:49:48.840 align:middle line:10%
And that's striving
for greatness.

00:49:48.840 --> 00:49:50.400 align:middle line:10%
That's actually an
act of greatness

00:49:50.400 --> 00:49:57.410 align:middle line:10%
that we are all able to achieve,
to be a beacon for others,

00:49:57.410 --> 00:50:01.790 align:middle line:10%
and so that we can live with
ourselves, that when it all

00:50:01.790 --> 00:50:05.270 align:middle line:10%
goes away, as it will one day,
because we all have to-- we all

00:50:05.270 --> 00:50:08.570 align:middle line:10%
have to move on, we can
look back and we can say,

00:50:08.570 --> 00:50:12.030 align:middle line:10%
I really honestly lived
according to my ideals.

00:50:12.030 --> 00:50:13.110 align:middle line:10%
I went after truth.

00:50:13.110 --> 00:50:15.230 align:middle line:10%
I tried to make myself
into the best person

00:50:15.230 --> 00:50:18.050 align:middle line:10%
I can be to deal with
all of the challenges

00:50:18.050 --> 00:50:20.480 align:middle line:10%
that life gave me,
including this subject,

00:50:20.480 --> 00:50:23.340 align:middle line:10%
and to be a beacon, an
inspiration for others.

00:50:23.340 --> 00:50:24.780 align:middle line:10%
That's the best thing we can do.

00:50:24.780 --> 00:50:26.070 align:middle line:10%
And I hope you do it.

00:50:26.070 --> 00:50:27.180 align:middle line:10%
And I do it.

00:50:27.180 --> 00:50:28.280 align:middle line:90%
And thank you.

00:50:28.280 --> 00:50:33.680 align:middle line:90%
