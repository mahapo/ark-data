00:00:04.455 --> 00:00:08.415 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:08.415 --> 00:00:11.400 align:middle line:90%


00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:14.220 align:middle line:10%
>> When the Templars
ascended into Egypt,

00:00:14.220 --> 00:00:18.090 align:middle line:10%
they were looking at a
number of different things,

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:22.433 align:middle line:10%
but they primarily were involved
in the area between Giza

00:00:22.433 --> 00:00:23.233 align:middle line:10%
and Saqqara.

00:00:23.233 --> 00:00:25.830 align:middle line:90%


00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:28.900 align:middle line:84%
And Saqqara is the
step pyramid of Djoser.

00:00:28.900 --> 00:00:32.520 align:middle line:84%
And obviously Giza is the
great Pyramid as well as

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:34.830 align:middle line:90%
the other pyramids.

00:00:34.830 --> 00:00:40.170 align:middle line:84%
That space, which is about a
20 mile area between the two,

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:44.960 align:middle line:84%
in ancient Egypt, was
referred to as Rostau.

00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:47.160 align:middle line:84%
That was the ancient
Egyptian name for it.

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:51.080 align:middle line:84%
So when the Templars encountered
this, and by the way,

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:55.520 align:middle line:84%
that area between
those two areas,

00:00:55.520 --> 00:01:01.890 align:middle line:84%
tourists flock to today to see
all the monuments above ground.

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:04.400 align:middle line:84%
But actually
underneath, there are

00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:08.553 align:middle line:84%
tunnels, miles of tunnels
between those two areas.

00:01:08.553 --> 00:01:10.220 align:middle line:84%
And I'm going to show
you some of what's

00:01:10.220 --> 00:01:12.920 align:middle line:84%
down in some of those
tunnels in a minute.

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:16.810 align:middle line:84%
But when the Templars
discovered this and realized

00:01:16.810 --> 00:01:21.970 align:middle line:84%
there was evidence of this
ancient civilization, this time

00:01:21.970 --> 00:01:27.820 align:middle line:84%
from what we now call Atlantis
or what the Templars were used

00:01:27.820 --> 00:01:38.310 align:middle line:84%
to associating with as the
time of Noah before the flood,

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:41.020 align:middle line:84%
they found this and
they marveled at it.

00:01:41.020 --> 00:01:43.320 align:middle line:84%
And then they understood
there was still

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:46.110 align:middle line:84%
a tradition being
passed down by the Copts

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:50.490 align:middle line:84%
that, hey, this area was
referred to as Rostau.

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:55.740 align:middle line:84%
Well, in the Greek and the
Latin language, Rostau--

00:01:55.740 --> 00:02:00.360 align:middle line:84%
ros actually means rose
and tau means cross.

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:03.090 align:middle line:84%
So the Templars, when
they encountered this,

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:04.910 align:middle line:90%
they're like rose cross.

00:02:04.910 --> 00:02:05.710 align:middle line:90%
Oh, cool.

00:02:05.710 --> 00:02:09.490 align:middle line:84%
So then they started using
the rose cross as a symbol.

00:02:09.490 --> 00:02:12.780 align:middle line:84%
And they certainly had a
rosy cross or a red cross

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:14.650 align:middle line:90%
that they wore on their mantles.

00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:17.160 align:middle line:84%
But even beyond that, they
started adopting the cross

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:18.520 align:middle line:90%
with the rose on it.

00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:22.000 align:middle line:84%
And this serves
several purposes.

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:24.420 align:middle line:84%
On the one hand, it was
pointing to this tradition

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:27.090 align:middle line:84%
in ancient Egypt,
but it was also

00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:30.960 align:middle line:84%
a way of establishing
good relations

00:02:30.960 --> 00:02:35.490 align:middle line:84%
with the Islamic traditions that
were already guarding the Middle

00:02:35.490 --> 00:02:37.290 align:middle line:90%
East at the time.

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:42.610 align:middle line:84%
The symbol for
meditation in Islam,

00:02:42.610 --> 00:02:47.710 align:middle line:84%
actually the word for meditation
in Arabic that you find in Islam

00:02:47.710 --> 00:02:53.710 align:middle line:84%
is the word "word",
like "word" in Arabic.

00:02:53.710 --> 00:02:55.510 align:middle line:90%
It might be a little confusing.

00:02:55.510 --> 00:02:59.595 align:middle line:90%
Word actually means meditation.

00:02:59.595 --> 00:03:03.490 align:middle line:90%
and it also means rose.

00:03:03.490 --> 00:03:06.517 align:middle line:84%
So you'll often
attend, if you ever

00:03:06.517 --> 00:03:08.350 align:middle line:84%
go to any of the mosques
in the middle east,

00:03:08.350 --> 00:03:11.620 align:middle line:84%
they'll regularly
have a rose window,

00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:14.530 align:middle line:84%
much like we find on
the cathedrals of France

00:03:14.530 --> 00:03:16.940 align:middle line:84%
that the Templars
helped to also build.

00:03:16.940 --> 00:03:21.790 align:middle line:84%
They were just taking ideas
that they found in the Holy Land

00:03:21.790 --> 00:03:24.520 align:middle line:84%
and then implementing
them in Europe.

00:03:24.520 --> 00:03:26.710 align:middle line:84%
And this is why, even
to this day, if you

00:03:26.710 --> 00:03:32.950 align:middle line:84%
look at a cathedral from the
air, it's set up like a cross,

00:03:32.950 --> 00:03:36.250 align:middle line:84%
but then it also has these
rose windows, which makes

00:03:36.250 --> 00:03:38.740 align:middle line:90%
them rose crosses, Rostau.

00:03:38.740 --> 00:03:42.590 align:middle line:84%
And it was alluding to
this tradition in Egypt

00:03:42.590 --> 00:03:44.730 align:middle line:90%
that they were bringing out.

00:03:44.730 --> 00:03:50.050 align:middle line:84%
But to the Muslims, they
adopted the symbol of the rose,

00:03:50.050 --> 00:03:53.110 align:middle line:84%
whereas the Christians adopted
the symbol of the cross.

00:03:53.110 --> 00:03:55.620 align:middle line:84%
So combining the
two, making a rose

00:03:55.620 --> 00:03:59.550 align:middle line:84%
cross was a united symbol
that both could agree on

00:03:59.550 --> 00:04:03.360 align:middle line:90%
or both could accept.

00:04:03.360 --> 00:04:06.750 align:middle line:84%
And in this was hidden
this philosophy.

00:04:06.750 --> 00:04:11.460 align:middle line:84%
And this-- later groups were
formed like the Rosicrucians

00:04:11.460 --> 00:04:14.070 align:middle line:84%
that specifically came
out of the Templars

00:04:14.070 --> 00:04:16.700 align:middle line:90%
after they were suppressed.

00:04:16.700 --> 00:04:21.019 align:middle line:84%
Anyhow, one of the other
places that the Templars had

00:04:21.019 --> 00:04:22.850 align:middle line:84%
a preceptory that
they had set up

00:04:22.850 --> 00:04:27.830 align:middle line:84%
was an island that's
in Egypt still

00:04:27.830 --> 00:04:31.100 align:middle line:84%
to this day that's referred
to as Elephantine Island.

00:04:31.100 --> 00:04:33.970 align:middle line:84%
And Elephantine Island
is closed to the public.

00:04:33.970 --> 00:04:37.080 align:middle line:90%


00:04:37.080 --> 00:04:40.440 align:middle line:84%
Part of the reason
is archeologists

00:04:40.440 --> 00:04:43.290 align:middle line:84%
have been digging there
for the last 40 years

00:04:43.290 --> 00:04:49.790 align:middle line:84%
because there is a number of
indications that one of the arks

00:04:49.790 --> 00:04:53.620 align:middle line:84%
is buried there, still to
this day, one of these arks.

00:04:53.620 --> 00:04:56.750 align:middle line:84%
And as Templars, what we
understand these arks were

00:04:56.750 --> 00:04:59.510 align:middle line:84%
is they're actually
capacitors, they're

00:04:59.510 --> 00:05:01.680 align:middle line:90%
electrostatic capacitors.

00:05:01.680 --> 00:05:03.620 align:middle line:84%
They're built in
such a way that they

00:05:03.620 --> 00:05:07.820 align:middle line:84%
would build up
static electricity

00:05:07.820 --> 00:05:10.130 align:middle line:90%
over a period of days.

00:05:10.130 --> 00:05:14.900 align:middle line:84%
The static electricity would be
discharged through the garlands,

00:05:14.900 --> 00:05:17.220 align:middle line:90%
the winged figures on the top.

00:05:17.220 --> 00:05:20.810 align:middle line:84%
And this is the reason
why even in the bible,

00:05:20.810 --> 00:05:21.990 align:middle line:90%
you couldn't touch the arc.

00:05:21.990 --> 00:05:24.110 align:middle line:84%
Otherwise, it would
kill you because it

00:05:24.110 --> 00:05:26.990 align:middle line:90%
would shock you to death.

00:05:26.990 --> 00:05:30.440 align:middle line:84%
Now, the white powder substance
that they were putting

00:05:30.440 --> 00:05:33.480 align:middle line:90%
in this ark was actually--

00:05:33.480 --> 00:05:36.650 align:middle line:84%
it was a superconductive
substance

00:05:36.650 --> 00:05:39.710 align:middle line:84%
that can be extracted out
of just about everything.

00:05:39.710 --> 00:05:43.550 align:middle line:90%


00:05:43.550 --> 00:05:46.280 align:middle line:84%
So when you put this
superconductive substance

00:05:46.280 --> 00:05:50.630 align:middle line:84%
in a capacitor like the ark, it
can produce a tremendous amount

00:05:50.630 --> 00:05:52.010 align:middle line:90%
of electricity.

00:05:52.010 --> 00:05:54.830 align:middle line:84%
In fact, some people
have even theorized

00:05:54.830 --> 00:05:57.260 align:middle line:84%
that it may be that
one of these arks

00:05:57.260 --> 00:06:00.290 align:middle line:84%
had even been put in
the King's Chamber,

00:06:00.290 --> 00:06:05.010 align:middle line:84%
in the sarcophagus of the
King's Chamber to again,

00:06:05.010 --> 00:06:07.860 align:middle line:84%
produce this
incredible electricity.

00:06:07.860 --> 00:06:11.090 align:middle line:84%
And this would turn the pyramid
into basically a broadcast

00:06:11.090 --> 00:06:17.420 align:middle line:84%
center for electricity, much
like what Nikola Tesla was

00:06:17.420 --> 00:06:19.460 align:middle line:84%
trying to do with his
Wardenclyffe Tower

00:06:19.460 --> 00:06:22.040 align:middle line:84%
where he was
broadcasting electricity.

00:06:22.040 --> 00:06:24.110 align:middle line:84%
So this would suggest
that this is probably

00:06:24.110 --> 00:06:26.150 align:middle line:84%
what the pyramid was used
for, even to this day,

00:06:26.150 --> 00:06:28.610 align:middle line:84%
even without an ark
in the great pyramid,

00:06:28.610 --> 00:06:33.410 align:middle line:84%
if you stand on top of the
Great Pyramid with a bottle,

00:06:33.410 --> 00:06:37.280 align:middle line:84%
with a wet rag on it, sparks
will shoot off of the wet rag

00:06:37.280 --> 00:06:41.960 align:middle line:84%
because just the natural
conduction from the desert

00:06:41.960 --> 00:06:45.780 align:middle line:84%
and how the pyramid is built,
it just builds it up in there.

00:06:45.780 --> 00:06:49.950 align:middle line:84%
And this may be true in the
Bible, why the ark was--

00:06:49.950 --> 00:06:54.670 align:middle line:84%
originally Moses erected this
tabernacle to put the ark in.

00:06:54.670 --> 00:06:57.640 align:middle line:84%
And the tabernacle was made
with these wool curtains.

00:06:57.640 --> 00:07:00.540 align:middle line:84%
If you know anything
about wool, it's

00:07:00.540 --> 00:07:03.130 align:middle line:84%
highly conductive to
static electricity.

00:07:03.130 --> 00:07:07.650 align:middle line:84%
So if you put this ark in
a room with wool curtains

00:07:07.650 --> 00:07:11.160 align:middle line:84%
in the middle of the desert,
it would just build up

00:07:11.160 --> 00:07:12.730 align:middle line:90%
that static electricity.

00:07:12.730 --> 00:07:16.570 align:middle line:84%
So we believe, as
the Templar order,

00:07:16.570 --> 00:07:18.340 align:middle line:84%
speaking as the Templar
order, that there

00:07:18.340 --> 00:07:21.220 align:middle line:84%
were several of
these arks were being

00:07:21.220 --> 00:07:22.760 align:middle line:90%
used all over ancient Egypt.

00:07:22.760 --> 00:07:25.930 align:middle line:84%
They had inherited this
technology from Atlantis

00:07:25.930 --> 00:07:32.830 align:middle line:84%
in antiquity, and that they
were literally just producing

00:07:32.830 --> 00:07:36.820 align:middle line:84%
electricity in the region
that was being utilized.

00:07:36.820 --> 00:07:40.900 align:middle line:84%
Anyhow, one of these
arks to this day,

00:07:40.900 --> 00:07:45.040 align:middle line:84%
the Egyptian
antiquities beliefs can

00:07:45.040 --> 00:07:48.550 align:middle line:84%
be found on Elephantine
Island, where the Templars also

00:07:48.550 --> 00:07:50.800 align:middle line:90%
had a preceptory.

00:07:50.800 --> 00:07:53.020 align:middle line:84%
One of the other
things that is found--

00:07:53.020 --> 00:07:55.330 align:middle line:84%
there's a few other
things that the Templars

00:07:55.330 --> 00:07:59.760 align:middle line:84%
found on Elephantine Island
that is worth pointing out.

00:07:59.760 --> 00:08:02.610 align:middle line:90%
This might be--

00:08:02.610 --> 00:08:05.220 align:middle line:84%
I know this is probably
hard for you guys to see.

00:08:05.220 --> 00:08:10.860 align:middle line:84%
And I tried to do a really
horrible drawing of it,

00:08:10.860 --> 00:08:12.510 align:middle line:90%
like tried to outline it.

00:08:12.510 --> 00:08:17.160 align:middle line:84%
But really what we have going
on here, if you bear with me,

00:08:17.160 --> 00:08:20.070 align:middle line:84%
on the left hand side,
is actually an Egyptian

00:08:20.070 --> 00:08:24.360 align:middle line:84%
and he has the horns
of Ammon on his head

00:08:24.360 --> 00:08:27.480 align:middle line:90%
and he's grabbing a necklace.

00:08:27.480 --> 00:08:32.309 align:middle line:84%
And the figure on the
right is actually a Mayan.

00:08:32.309 --> 00:08:34.860 align:middle line:84%
Well, this is a problem
for standard history,

00:08:34.860 --> 00:08:36.360 align:middle line:84%
and it's part of
the reason why they

00:08:36.360 --> 00:08:42.150 align:middle line:84%
keep Elephantine Island
closed, because the hieroglyphs

00:08:42.150 --> 00:08:47.190 align:middle line:84%
and the imagery all talk
about these two lions

00:08:47.190 --> 00:08:50.370 align:middle line:84%
on either side of the
great body of water, which

00:08:50.370 --> 00:08:52.920 align:middle line:90%
would be the Atlantic Ocean.

00:08:52.920 --> 00:08:58.410 align:middle line:84%
And that these other people are
someone that the Egyptians were

00:08:58.410 --> 00:09:00.050 align:middle line:90%
aware of and were trading with.

00:09:00.050 --> 00:09:04.110 align:middle line:84%
In fact, that's why he was
giving his beaded necklace

00:09:04.110 --> 00:09:05.760 align:middle line:90%
to the guy.

00:09:05.760 --> 00:09:08.400 align:middle line:84%
So this is one of
the things that's

00:09:08.400 --> 00:09:11.130 align:middle line:84%
found on Elephantine Island,
which again, suggests

00:09:11.130 --> 00:09:15.940 align:middle line:84%
that the Egyptians had
become aware of land

00:09:15.940 --> 00:09:18.020 align:middle line:84%
on the other side
of the Atlantic.

00:09:18.020 --> 00:09:20.230 align:middle line:84%
They certainly had
seaworthy boats

00:09:20.230 --> 00:09:23.830 align:middle line:84%
and they were probably
visiting them regularly.

00:09:23.830 --> 00:09:26.860 align:middle line:84%
So not only were
they going there,

00:09:26.860 --> 00:09:29.140 align:middle line:84%
but also found on
Elephantine Island

00:09:29.140 --> 00:09:33.110 align:middle line:84%
or were also found
all these boomerangs.

00:09:33.110 --> 00:09:36.260 align:middle line:90%
Well, that's a problem, too.

00:09:36.260 --> 00:09:37.800 align:middle line:90%
Where do we find boomerangs?

00:09:37.800 --> 00:09:39.620 align:middle line:90%
Australia, right?

00:09:39.620 --> 00:09:42.170 align:middle line:84%
It seems to suggest that
the Egyptians were also

00:09:42.170 --> 00:09:44.440 align:middle line:90%
traveling to Australia.

00:09:44.440 --> 00:09:46.820 align:middle line:84%
So the Templars
learned about this,

00:09:46.820 --> 00:09:50.150 align:middle line:84%
and this was part
of the information

00:09:50.150 --> 00:09:52.350 align:middle line:90%
that they were gaining.

00:09:52.350 --> 00:09:54.050 align:middle line:84%
And it's part of
what allowed them

00:09:54.050 --> 00:09:58.280 align:middle line:84%
to know that they could travel
to the New World of the Americas

00:09:58.280 --> 00:09:59.610 align:middle line:90%
very early on.

00:09:59.610 --> 00:10:03.980 align:middle line:84%
And in fact, the Templars were
trading silver with the Mayans

00:10:03.980 --> 00:10:06.760 align:middle line:84%
long before Columbus
ever came over.

00:10:06.760 --> 00:10:09.350 align:middle line:90%
That's a whole other story.

00:10:09.350 --> 00:10:11.730 align:middle line:90%
But they were gaining--

00:10:11.730 --> 00:10:14.360 align:middle line:84%
they gained the knowledge
of it from places like Egypt

00:10:14.360 --> 00:10:16.010 align:middle line:90%
and Elephantine Island.

00:10:16.010 --> 00:10:19.290 align:middle line:84%
In fact, here's this
is an Egyptian tomb.

00:10:19.290 --> 00:10:24.090 align:middle line:84%
And you see a figure here
with one of these boomerangs.

00:10:24.090 --> 00:10:27.470 align:middle line:84%
The Egyptian antiquities, if
they acknowledge them at all,

00:10:27.470 --> 00:10:31.070 align:middle line:84%
they just refer to them
as magic throwing sticks.

00:10:31.070 --> 00:10:34.650 align:middle line:84%
It's like, well, what makes
a throwing stick magic?

00:10:34.650 --> 00:10:36.280 align:middle line:84%
Because it comes
back to you, right?

00:10:36.280 --> 00:10:40.680 align:middle line:84%
So also, by the
way, in this tomb

00:10:40.680 --> 00:10:48.790 align:middle line:84%
is depicted a figure holding a
baby, woolly mammoth and also

00:10:48.790 --> 00:10:50.680 align:middle line:90%
a giant sloth.

00:10:50.680 --> 00:10:52.630 align:middle line:90%
He's walking them.

00:10:52.630 --> 00:10:55.870 align:middle line:84%
Now, this is not-- there were no
woolly mammoths during the time

00:10:55.870 --> 00:10:57.670 align:middle line:90%
of the ancient Egyptians.

00:10:57.670 --> 00:11:00.190 align:middle line:84%
But what it does suggest
is that the Egyptians

00:11:00.190 --> 00:11:05.440 align:middle line:84%
were trying to preserve a record
of what had happened in the past

00:11:05.440 --> 00:11:09.510 align:middle line:84%
that they still had
knowledge of, OK?

00:11:09.510 --> 00:11:14.290 align:middle line:84%
So here we have this baby woolly
mammoth, pretty fascinating.

00:11:14.290 --> 00:11:17.210 align:middle line:90%


00:11:17.210 --> 00:11:18.880 align:middle line:90%
All right.

00:11:18.880 --> 00:11:21.370 align:middle line:84%
So this area of
Rostau I mentioned

00:11:21.370 --> 00:11:26.000 align:middle line:84%
between Giza and
Saqqara, most people

00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:28.200 align:middle line:84%
are aware of what's
above the ground.

00:11:28.200 --> 00:11:30.050 align:middle line:84%
If you go to Egypt,
you go on any tour,

00:11:30.050 --> 00:11:33.440 align:middle line:84%
they'll take you to the
step pyramid of Djoser.

00:11:33.440 --> 00:11:40.800 align:middle line:84%
They'll take you to the Great
Pyramid of the Giza Plateau.

00:11:40.800 --> 00:11:44.890 align:middle line:84%
But what they don't
normally take you to

00:11:44.890 --> 00:11:52.310 align:middle line:84%
is underground, 200 feet
below the surface of Giza.

00:11:52.310 --> 00:11:56.200 align:middle line:84%
You look at the left here, this
is about a quarter of the way

00:11:56.200 --> 00:11:57.670 align:middle line:90%
down.

00:11:57.670 --> 00:12:03.290 align:middle line:84%
And by the way, all
of these mud bricks

00:12:03.290 --> 00:12:06.290 align:middle line:84%
were built by the
ancient Egyptians

00:12:06.290 --> 00:12:09.460 align:middle line:90%
to preserve these sites.

00:12:09.460 --> 00:12:14.870 align:middle line:84%
But what's under
down in the tunnels

00:12:14.870 --> 00:12:19.460 align:middle line:84%
existed prior to the
ancient Egyptians.

00:12:19.460 --> 00:12:23.480 align:middle line:84%
And what we find
down in these areas

00:12:23.480 --> 00:12:29.360 align:middle line:84%
are huge megalithic
boxes that we

00:12:29.360 --> 00:12:32.660 align:middle line:84%
know they came from Aswan,
which was about 600 miles away,

00:12:32.660 --> 00:12:33.920 align:middle line:90%
the granite.

00:12:33.920 --> 00:12:38.730 align:middle line:84%
And the Egyptologists don't
know what they were used for.

00:12:38.730 --> 00:12:40.970 align:middle line:84%
They don't even know how
they got them down there.

00:12:40.970 --> 00:12:45.000 align:middle line:84%
I mean, this is
one of the boxes.

00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:49.200 align:middle line:84%
It's about the
size of this stage.

00:12:49.200 --> 00:12:51.470 align:middle line:90%
It's about as long as the stage.

00:12:51.470 --> 00:12:53.550 align:middle line:90%
It was about double in size.

00:12:53.550 --> 00:12:58.080 align:middle line:84%
And then up to about
here from the ground.

00:12:58.080 --> 00:13:05.010 align:middle line:84%
And when the Egyptologists
opened these boxes,

00:13:05.010 --> 00:13:08.610 align:middle line:84%
they didn't find any
mummies inside them.

00:13:08.610 --> 00:13:13.700 align:middle line:84%
The only thing they
found was a white powder,

00:13:13.700 --> 00:13:22.390 align:middle line:84%
which is this Manna is being
preserved by this ancient group

00:13:22.390 --> 00:13:24.840 align:middle line:90%
that survived the cataclysm.

00:13:24.840 --> 00:13:29.100 align:middle line:84%
We now think that these tunnels
were probably survival shelters.

00:13:29.100 --> 00:13:33.360 align:middle line:84%
Privately, the
Egyptian antiquities

00:13:33.360 --> 00:13:41.520 align:middle line:84%
will say areas like these where
these tunnels are and also areas

00:13:41.520 --> 00:13:43.720 align:middle line:90%
like the Valley of the Kings.

00:13:43.720 --> 00:13:46.080 align:middle line:84%
Most people, when they think
of the Valley of the Kings,

00:13:46.080 --> 00:13:50.880 align:middle line:84%
they think of just these
individual little tombs that

00:13:50.880 --> 00:13:52.860 align:middle line:90%
were built on the hillsides.

00:13:52.860 --> 00:13:55.050 align:middle line:84%
But what they don't
realize is actually

00:13:55.050 --> 00:13:58.500 align:middle line:84%
all of these tombs
are all connected

00:13:58.500 --> 00:14:01.570 align:middle line:90%
by tunnels that go underground.

00:14:01.570 --> 00:14:09.090 align:middle line:84%
And there are hundreds of miles
of tunnels under this area.

00:14:09.090 --> 00:14:11.790 align:middle line:90%
Now, if you were trying to--

00:14:11.790 --> 00:14:13.680 align:middle line:84%
if you were building
something like this,

00:14:13.680 --> 00:14:16.890 align:middle line:84%
it would take-- if you
didn't have modern equipment,

00:14:16.890 --> 00:14:19.050 align:middle line:84%
it would take
thousands of workers

00:14:19.050 --> 00:14:20.828 align:middle line:90%
to dig out these tunnels.

00:14:20.828 --> 00:14:22.620 align:middle line:84%
And if you're trying
to create a space that

00:14:22.620 --> 00:14:28.875 align:middle line:84%
was hidden to be buried at, does
it make a whole lot of sense

00:14:28.875 --> 00:14:31.090 align:middle line:84%
to bring in
thousands of workers?

00:14:31.090 --> 00:14:37.070 align:middle line:84%
Because the secret would get out
real quick where this area was.

00:14:37.070 --> 00:14:42.410 align:middle line:84%
So it's more likely that the
pharaohs knew of this place

00:14:42.410 --> 00:14:46.760 align:middle line:84%
where this tunnel network was
because it had been a survival

00:14:46.760 --> 00:14:50.920 align:middle line:90%
area during the last cataclysm.

00:14:50.920 --> 00:14:53.950 align:middle line:84%
And that they
wanted to be buried

00:14:53.950 --> 00:14:58.680 align:middle line:84%
close to where the
ancients had come out

00:14:58.680 --> 00:15:01.530 align:middle line:84%
of during the time of the
Zep Tepi, the first time

00:15:01.530 --> 00:15:03.780 align:middle line:90%
after this cataclysm.

00:15:03.780 --> 00:15:09.690 align:middle line:84%
And they wanted to be remembered
as preserving the legacy of what

00:15:09.690 --> 00:15:11.380 align:middle line:90%
had come out of that tradition.

00:15:11.380 --> 00:15:13.560 align:middle line:84%
And that's more
than likely really

00:15:13.560 --> 00:15:15.660 align:middle line:84%
why these Pharaohs
wanted to be buried

00:15:15.660 --> 00:15:17.170 align:middle line:90%
in the Valley of the Kings.

00:15:17.170 --> 00:15:21.830 align:middle line:84%
And I think that'll be
established and proven

00:15:21.830 --> 00:15:23.510 align:middle line:90%
in the years ahead.

00:15:23.510 --> 00:15:27.510 align:middle line:84%
That's certainly what the
theory is at this time.

00:15:27.510 --> 00:15:31.790 align:middle line:84%
But nearby, there's an area
known as the Serapeum, which

00:15:31.790 --> 00:15:34.550 align:middle line:90%
is part of this tunnel network.

00:15:34.550 --> 00:15:38.810 align:middle line:84%
They have these
giant granite boxes.

00:15:38.810 --> 00:15:41.840 align:middle line:84%
And this granite is, I
think it's called dendrite

00:15:41.840 --> 00:15:51.464 align:middle line:84%
or it is the hardest granite
that you can find anywhere.

00:15:51.464 --> 00:15:58.500 align:middle line:84%
We need serious diamond
drills and stuff

00:15:58.500 --> 00:16:01.000 align:middle line:84%
to even cut this
type of granite.

00:16:01.000 --> 00:16:04.950 align:middle line:84%
And yet we find these
giant boxes made of that

00:16:04.950 --> 00:16:07.170 align:middle line:84%
down in these
tunnels, and they're

00:16:07.170 --> 00:16:09.600 align:middle line:90%
cut with super precision.

00:16:09.600 --> 00:16:14.310 align:middle line:84%
And these things weigh
a few hundred tons.

00:16:14.310 --> 00:16:16.890 align:middle line:84%
So we don't even know how they
got them down in these tunnels

00:16:16.890 --> 00:16:21.215 align:middle line:84%
to begin with, nor do we know
what they were using them for.

00:16:21.215 --> 00:16:24.390 align:middle line:84%
And most of the lids have
been found slightly open

00:16:24.390 --> 00:16:27.610 align:middle line:84%
like this, like somebody had
opened them in antiquity.

00:16:27.610 --> 00:16:30.510 align:middle line:84%
The only thing that would have
ever been found in any of these

00:16:30.510 --> 00:16:33.610 align:middle line:90%
is this white powder.

00:16:33.610 --> 00:16:37.130 align:middle line:90%
OK, this Manna.

00:16:37.130 --> 00:16:40.370 align:middle line:90%
Here's some more examples of it.

00:16:40.370 --> 00:16:42.145 align:middle line:90%
I mean, huge, huge.

00:16:42.145 --> 00:16:45.680 align:middle line:90%


00:16:45.680 --> 00:16:50.720 align:middle line:84%
And we find, again, evidence
of the drilling of like saws

00:16:50.720 --> 00:16:55.090 align:middle line:90%
almost cutting this granite.

00:16:55.090 --> 00:16:58.030 align:middle line:84%
And again, this is something
that the Egyptians didn't

00:16:58.030 --> 00:17:00.430 align:middle line:90%
have the technology to do this.

00:17:00.430 --> 00:17:07.000 align:middle line:84%
So we're literally looking at
evidence of a high civilization

00:17:07.000 --> 00:17:10.780 align:middle line:84%
technology that could
even create these things,

00:17:10.780 --> 00:17:13.390 align:middle line:84%
let alone create the
tunnels and get them down

00:17:13.390 --> 00:17:19.859 align:middle line:84%
in the tunnels in a way that
we couldn't do it today.

00:17:19.859 --> 00:17:25.660 align:middle line:84%
But you could see the cutting
technique on some of these.

00:17:25.660 --> 00:17:29.620 align:middle line:84%
As I mentioned, the templars,
they set up bases of operations

00:17:29.620 --> 00:17:31.580 align:middle line:84%
at all of these
areas around Egypt.

00:17:31.580 --> 00:17:34.510 align:middle line:84%
So they were collecting this
knowledge and bringing it back.

00:17:34.510 --> 00:17:38.350 align:middle line:84%
And so even to this day,
you'll see the Templar cross

00:17:38.350 --> 00:17:39.560 align:middle line:90%
all over the place.

00:17:39.560 --> 00:17:41.980 align:middle line:84%
This is at the Temple
of Isis at Philae,

00:17:41.980 --> 00:17:45.460 align:middle line:84%
you'll find probably 30
of these crosses carved

00:17:45.460 --> 00:17:47.530 align:middle line:84%
all over the place
at the temple.

00:17:47.530 --> 00:17:49.750 align:middle line:90%
This is at Dendera.

00:17:49.750 --> 00:17:52.690 align:middle line:84%
This was one of the
Templar preceptory

00:17:52.690 --> 00:17:55.950 align:middle line:84%
that was there at Dendera
at the Temple of Hathor.

00:17:55.950 --> 00:17:58.278 align:middle line:90%
This is also the Temple of Isis.

00:17:58.278 --> 00:17:59.820 align:middle line:84%
And by the way, this
is another thing

00:17:59.820 --> 00:18:01.170 align:middle line:90%
that the Templars brought back.

00:18:01.170 --> 00:18:03.000 align:middle line:84%
When they went to
the Temple of Isis

00:18:03.000 --> 00:18:05.730 align:middle line:84%
and they set up their
commandery there,

00:18:05.730 --> 00:18:11.880 align:middle line:84%
they encountered this statue of
Isis holding little baby Horus.

00:18:11.880 --> 00:18:14.028 align:middle line:90%
And so they sought--

00:18:14.028 --> 00:18:15.570 align:middle line:84%
when the Templars
went back to Europe

00:18:15.570 --> 00:18:18.600 align:middle line:84%
and started building the
cathedrals in the same manner

00:18:18.600 --> 00:18:21.360 align:middle line:84%
that the Egyptian
temples were built,

00:18:21.360 --> 00:18:26.850 align:middle line:84%
they put in the crypts,
these black Madonnas

00:18:26.850 --> 00:18:31.810 align:middle line:84%
specifically because they were
trying to mimic the Isis holding

00:18:31.810 --> 00:18:33.970 align:middle line:84%
Horus that they found
at the Temple of Isis

00:18:33.970 --> 00:18:37.290 align:middle line:84%
where they set up their
commandery in Egypt.

00:18:37.290 --> 00:18:39.490 align:middle line:84%
And that's the reason why
they are painted black.

00:18:39.490 --> 00:18:42.410 align:middle line:84%
People always wonder, well,
why were they painted black?

00:18:42.410 --> 00:18:44.200 align:middle line:84%
And it was because
they were literally

00:18:44.200 --> 00:18:48.820 align:middle line:84%
trying to recreate a
version of Isis and Horus

00:18:48.820 --> 00:18:51.370 align:middle line:84%
that they found at
the Temple of Isis.

00:18:51.370 --> 00:18:53.460 align:middle line:90%
Here's another depiction of it.

00:18:53.460 --> 00:18:58.870 align:middle line:84%
This is Isis here on the right,
Isis holding Horus, that's

00:18:58.870 --> 00:19:03.490 align:middle line:84%
a hieroglyphic carving on the
wall there at the Temple of Isis

00:19:03.490 --> 00:19:05.420 align:middle line:90%
at Philae.

00:19:05.420 --> 00:19:08.630 align:middle line:90%
But this was the main altar.

00:19:08.630 --> 00:19:12.170 align:middle line:84%
Here on the left at the
Temple of Isis at Philae.

00:19:12.170 --> 00:19:15.170 align:middle line:84%
And this statue of
Isis holding Horus

00:19:15.170 --> 00:19:17.480 align:middle line:90%
used to be on top of that altar.

00:19:17.480 --> 00:19:20.540 align:middle line:84%
And of course, the Templars,
they encountered that.

00:19:20.540 --> 00:19:26.510 align:middle line:84%
And yeah, that's why I'm
there paying my respects.

00:19:26.510 --> 00:19:28.730 align:middle line:90%
Here's some more.

00:19:28.730 --> 00:19:32.390 align:middle line:90%
Again, Templar carvings.

00:19:32.390 --> 00:19:38.690 align:middle line:84%
This is at Edfu, where the
Atlantis myth is carved.

00:19:38.690 --> 00:19:44.990 align:middle line:84%
And this particular Templar
cross, it has these five dots,

00:19:44.990 --> 00:19:48.745 align:middle line:84%
dot in the center and then
the four dots around the side.

00:19:48.745 --> 00:19:51.620 align:middle line:90%


00:19:51.620 --> 00:19:56.690 align:middle line:84%
That's a Templar
symbol, those five dots.

00:19:56.690 --> 00:20:00.080 align:middle line:84%
Anytime you see five dots
like that anywhere, it's

00:20:00.080 --> 00:20:02.090 align:middle line:90%
usually a symbol--

00:20:02.090 --> 00:20:05.930 align:middle line:84%
a Templar symbol that
Templars were there.

00:20:05.930 --> 00:20:11.280 align:middle line:84%
Here's also-- this is at the
Temple of Hathor at Dendera.

00:20:11.280 --> 00:20:13.310 align:middle line:90%
These are Templar graffiti.

00:20:13.310 --> 00:20:18.020 align:middle line:84%
Templars loved to carve the
graffiti in all these places

00:20:18.020 --> 00:20:19.130 align:middle line:90%
where they were.

00:20:19.130 --> 00:20:21.440 align:middle line:90%
Here's some of these tunnels.

00:20:21.440 --> 00:20:23.690 align:middle line:84%
Just an example of some
of the tunnels that are

00:20:23.690 --> 00:20:27.950 align:middle line:90%
found between Saqqara and Giza.

00:20:27.950 --> 00:20:33.290 align:middle line:84%
They are not open to the public,
though, I've gotten permission

00:20:33.290 --> 00:20:34.730 align:middle line:90%
to go in some of them.

00:20:34.730 --> 00:20:38.300 align:middle line:84%
And just gives you a
sense that a lot of them,

00:20:38.300 --> 00:20:43.460 align:middle line:84%
they just go again for miles and
they have a few of them lit up,

00:20:43.460 --> 00:20:45.170 align:middle line:90%
but most of them aren't lit up.

00:20:45.170 --> 00:20:48.800 align:middle line:84%
They're just lit up
in certain areas.

00:20:48.800 --> 00:20:53.760 align:middle line:84%
And all they found down in them
is these giant boxes filled

00:20:53.760 --> 00:20:55.740 align:middle line:90%
with this white powder.

00:20:55.740 --> 00:20:57.750 align:middle line:84%
So clearly this
is very important

00:20:57.750 --> 00:21:01.420 align:middle line:84%
that they're trying to
preserve this in ancient Egypt.

00:21:01.420 --> 00:21:04.250 align:middle line:90%
This is behind Abydos.

00:21:04.250 --> 00:21:06.610 align:middle line:90%
This is the Osireion.

00:21:06.610 --> 00:21:08.553 align:middle line:84%
It's actually named
after the god Osiris.

00:21:08.553 --> 00:21:11.110 align:middle line:90%


00:21:11.110 --> 00:21:17.980 align:middle line:84%
As Templars, we believe this
was the alchemical manufacturing

00:21:17.980 --> 00:21:22.580 align:middle line:90%
plant here at the Osireion.

00:21:22.580 --> 00:21:25.430 align:middle line:84%
It's some of the
oldest megalithic ruins

00:21:25.430 --> 00:21:28.770 align:middle line:84%
in Egypt accepted by
modern archeologists.

00:21:28.770 --> 00:21:30.890 align:middle line:90%
You can see it's underground.

00:21:30.890 --> 00:21:36.720 align:middle line:84%
It has these giant
monoliths in it,

00:21:36.720 --> 00:21:40.740 align:middle line:84%
almost like Stonehenge in
terms of how they're set up.

00:21:40.740 --> 00:21:44.860 align:middle line:84%
But these stones are all,
again, interlocking as well.

00:21:44.860 --> 00:21:50.250 align:middle line:84%
And they weigh hundreds of
tons each of these stones.

00:21:50.250 --> 00:21:53.080 align:middle line:84%
And we don't know how
they got them down there.

00:21:53.080 --> 00:21:56.540 align:middle line:84%
We don't know how
they set it up.

00:21:56.540 --> 00:21:58.500 align:middle line:84%
We know where the
granite comes from,

00:21:58.500 --> 00:22:01.020 align:middle line:84%
it comes from Aswan,
again 500 miles away.

00:22:01.020 --> 00:22:03.020 align:middle line:84%
But in order to
get it to the Nile,

00:22:03.020 --> 00:22:06.170 align:middle line:84%
you actually have to go over
a mountain range and then

00:22:06.170 --> 00:22:07.310 align:middle line:90%
down to the Nile.

00:22:07.310 --> 00:22:13.400 align:middle line:84%
So no Egyptologist has
been able to explain yet

00:22:13.400 --> 00:22:14.900 align:middle line:90%
how they managed to do that.

00:22:14.900 --> 00:22:19.812 align:middle line:84%
But what we believe
is that the--

00:22:19.812 --> 00:22:21.660 align:middle line:84%
what you see here
is there's water

00:22:21.660 --> 00:22:24.180 align:middle line:90%
that seeps in from this pipe.

00:22:24.180 --> 00:22:25.630 align:middle line:90%
And it fills up.

00:22:25.630 --> 00:22:29.560 align:middle line:84%
And this is water from
the Nile where there's all

00:22:29.560 --> 00:22:34.470 align:middle line:84%
the rich sediment and
minerals and other things

00:22:34.470 --> 00:22:39.160 align:middle line:84%
that the Egyptians were
trying to extract out of.

00:22:39.160 --> 00:22:41.362 align:middle line:84%
And in fact, they were
trying to extract--

00:22:41.362 --> 00:22:42.820 align:middle line:84%
this is where they
were also trying

00:22:42.820 --> 00:22:45.010 align:middle line:90%
to extract that white powder.

00:22:45.010 --> 00:22:47.500 align:middle line:84%
And I'm going to show you how
they did that process here

00:22:47.500 --> 00:22:51.740 align:middle line:84%
in a second and how that
relates to the Egyptian myth.

00:22:51.740 --> 00:22:54.090 align:middle line:84%
This is actually
the area of Aswan.

00:22:54.090 --> 00:22:58.110 align:middle line:84%
This is the unfinished
Obelisk at Aswan.

00:22:58.110 --> 00:23:00.290 align:middle line:84%
Here you see a little
person standing on it

00:23:00.290 --> 00:23:03.930 align:middle line:84%
kind of gives you a sense
of how big this Obelisk is.

00:23:03.930 --> 00:23:08.240 align:middle line:84%
It probably weighs
well over 1,000 tons,

00:23:08.240 --> 00:23:13.070 align:middle line:84%
which the only stones that I've
found comparable to that size

00:23:13.070 --> 00:23:18.500 align:middle line:84%
are at Baalbek in Lebanon,
which isn't too far away,

00:23:18.500 --> 00:23:20.060 align:middle line:90%
and pretty incredible.

00:23:20.060 --> 00:23:23.570 align:middle line:84%
But no one knows really even
how they carved them, let alone

00:23:23.570 --> 00:23:25.970 align:middle line:90%
how they would have moved them.

00:23:25.970 --> 00:23:28.028 align:middle line:84%
This one they left
in the quarry.

00:23:28.028 --> 00:23:30.320 align:middle line:84%
So that's the only reason
why we know it's still there.

00:23:30.320 --> 00:23:32.060 align:middle line:84%
But there are other
giant Obelisks

00:23:32.060 --> 00:23:36.290 align:middle line:84%
that can be found at
Luxor that really we

00:23:36.290 --> 00:23:38.010 align:middle line:90%
don't know how they moved them.

00:23:38.010 --> 00:23:43.610 align:middle line:84%
I mean, we moved a few
smaller Obelisks from Luxor

00:23:43.610 --> 00:23:50.090 align:middle line:84%
to the United States and to
London and to Constantinople

00:23:50.090 --> 00:23:54.440 align:middle line:90%
and to the Vatican and to Paris.

00:23:54.440 --> 00:23:59.210 align:middle line:84%
But these were relatively
tiny Obelisks compared

00:23:59.210 --> 00:24:01.430 align:middle line:84%
to what's actually
there in Egypt,

00:24:01.430 --> 00:24:06.500 align:middle line:84%
because that was the best that
we could do with our technology

00:24:06.500 --> 00:24:12.470 align:middle line:90%
in the late 1800s, early 1900s.

00:24:12.470 --> 00:24:15.380 align:middle line:84%
We couldn't move
anything any bigger.

00:24:15.380 --> 00:24:17.390 align:middle line:84%
But somehow the
Egyptians clearly did,

00:24:17.390 --> 00:24:19.400 align:middle line:90%
because we know where the--

00:24:19.400 --> 00:24:21.860 align:middle line:84%
the precursors to
the Egyptians did,

00:24:21.860 --> 00:24:25.070 align:middle line:84%
because we know they came
from this quarry at Aswan

00:24:25.070 --> 00:24:26.940 align:middle line:90%
and they were clearly moved.

00:24:26.940 --> 00:24:31.430 align:middle line:84%
So how they did it,
we don't know, really.

00:24:31.430 --> 00:24:34.160 align:middle line:84%
The other thing that
the Templars encountered

00:24:34.160 --> 00:24:40.000 align:middle line:84%
at all of these sites in Egypt
in the sanctum sanctorums

00:24:40.000 --> 00:24:43.150 align:middle line:90%
were mentions of Stargates.

00:24:43.150 --> 00:24:44.770 align:middle line:84%
Literally, this
is the hieroglyphs

00:24:44.770 --> 00:24:50.640 align:middle line:90%
for Stargate or Saba, Stargate.

00:24:50.640 --> 00:24:54.570 align:middle line:84%
There's all these depictions
in the sanctum sanctorums

00:24:54.570 --> 00:24:58.780 align:middle line:84%
of all of the Egyptian temples
just outside the doors.

00:24:58.780 --> 00:25:01.380 align:middle line:84%
It mentions that
it's a Stargate.

00:25:01.380 --> 00:25:05.955 align:middle line:84%
In some of these areas, like
down here at the bottom,

00:25:05.955 --> 00:25:09.540 align:middle line:84%
this is at the funerary
temple of Hatshepsut.

00:25:09.540 --> 00:25:13.960 align:middle line:84%
In the sanctum sanctorum
of that particular temple,

00:25:13.960 --> 00:25:17.420 align:middle line:84%
there is an area that
mentions Stargate.

00:25:17.420 --> 00:25:21.910 align:middle line:84%
The Egyptian government has
guards posted there 24/7.

00:25:21.910 --> 00:25:25.470 align:middle line:84%
You're not allowed
to go inside there.

00:25:25.470 --> 00:25:30.360 align:middle line:84%
And if you go in there
and the Egyptian--

00:25:30.360 --> 00:25:32.503 align:middle line:84%
the guards get caught,
they go to prison

00:25:32.503 --> 00:25:33.670 align:middle line:90%
for the rest of their lives.

00:25:33.670 --> 00:25:37.460 align:middle line:84%
That's how serious the Egyptian
government is about it.

00:25:37.460 --> 00:25:41.300 align:middle line:84%
But in that temple, which
I've been able to go in there,

00:25:41.300 --> 00:25:44.030 align:middle line:84%
this is actually a picture
from it on the bottom,

00:25:44.030 --> 00:25:50.990 align:middle line:84%
Here you see again this Stargate
and they're opening it up.

00:25:50.990 --> 00:25:54.500 align:middle line:84%
Regularly, they
depict netjer or gods

00:25:54.500 --> 00:26:00.110 align:middle line:84%
coming out of these Stargates
and then teaching the Pharaoh.

00:26:00.110 --> 00:26:02.060 align:middle line:84%
Now we can speculate
on what that

00:26:02.060 --> 00:26:05.510 align:middle line:84%
is, if it's extraterrestrials
or if it's just

00:26:05.510 --> 00:26:09.620 align:middle line:84%
the forces of nature or if it's
some sort of astrological thing,

00:26:09.620 --> 00:26:13.490 align:middle line:84%
like the influences
of the stars affecting

00:26:13.490 --> 00:26:17.390 align:middle line:84%
the Pharaoh's decisions
being depicted symbolically

00:26:17.390 --> 00:26:19.670 align:middle line:90%
by these gods.

00:26:19.670 --> 00:26:24.500 align:middle line:84%
But it seems to
suggest that they're

00:26:24.500 --> 00:26:30.040 align:middle line:84%
alluding to beings coming
from certain star systems.

00:26:30.040 --> 00:26:33.610 align:middle line:84%
And that there were these
gates set up in these temples

00:26:33.610 --> 00:26:42.260 align:middle line:84%
that they could somehow
connect with these beings.

00:26:42.260 --> 00:26:44.690 align:middle line:84%
And you find that in all
those Egyptian temples.

00:26:44.690 --> 00:26:47.900 align:middle line:84%
They also find-- up
here, that's actually

00:26:47.900 --> 00:26:51.350 align:middle line:84%
a hieroglyph that's found
on all of the pillars

00:26:51.350 --> 00:26:52.710 align:middle line:90%
around ancient Egypt.

00:26:52.710 --> 00:26:55.710 align:middle line:84%
It's at the base of all the
pillars of ancient Egypt.

00:26:55.710 --> 00:27:01.330 align:middle line:84%
And what it means is it means
to be received from the stars.

00:27:01.330 --> 00:27:06.020 align:middle line:84%
So the Egyptians are
literally saying, hey,

00:27:06.020 --> 00:27:08.480 align:middle line:84%
everything that we
have here, we received

00:27:08.480 --> 00:27:12.010 align:middle line:90%
from elsewhere in the stars.

00:27:12.010 --> 00:27:15.280 align:middle line:84%
And the Stargate seem to
be pointing to the fact

00:27:15.280 --> 00:27:19.620 align:middle line:84%
that that's the way of
communication with whoever

00:27:19.620 --> 00:27:21.780 align:middle line:90%
was giving them this knowledge.

00:27:21.780 --> 00:27:23.160 align:middle line:90%
That's kind of interesting.

00:27:23.160 --> 00:27:26.040 align:middle line:84%
Again, these are some of the
things the Templars came across.

00:27:26.040 --> 00:27:28.600 align:middle line:90%
We're trying to make sense of.

00:27:28.600 --> 00:27:33.260 align:middle line:84%
The Templars tried to preserve
the knowledge of some of this.

00:27:33.260 --> 00:27:36.010 align:middle line:10%
Their commandery building
in Constantinople,

00:27:36.010 --> 00:27:41.410 align:middle line:10%
for example, used to be called
the Church of Saint Sergius

00:27:41.410 --> 00:27:44.890 align:middle line:10%
and Bacchus, is now referred
to as the little Hagia Sophia

00:27:44.890 --> 00:27:45.870 align:middle line:10%
Mosque.

00:27:45.870 --> 00:27:49.540 align:middle line:84%
It actually has depicted on
it the earliest depiction

00:27:49.540 --> 00:27:51.760 align:middle line:84%
of a square and
compasses I've ever

00:27:51.760 --> 00:27:56.830 align:middle line:84%
found in Europe, which became
the symbol for Freemasonry.

00:27:56.830 --> 00:28:00.250 align:middle line:84%
It's not too much of a secret
that Freemasonry literally

00:28:00.250 --> 00:28:05.260 align:middle line:84%
came out of the Templars after
the Templars were suppressed.

00:28:05.260 --> 00:28:08.710 align:middle line:10%
But here on the pillar,
you find a square

00:28:08.710 --> 00:28:11.885 align:middle line:10%
and compasses next
to an Egyptian ankh.

00:28:11.885 --> 00:28:14.260 align:middle line:10%
And again, it's because the
Templars-- and this goes back

00:28:14.260 --> 00:28:17.050 align:middle line:10%
to the time of when this
was the main commandery

00:28:17.050 --> 00:28:19.250 align:middle line:10%
for the Templars.

00:28:19.250 --> 00:28:21.640 align:middle line:84%
In fact, Hugues de Payens
and Godfrey de Saint-Omer

00:28:21.640 --> 00:28:24.190 align:middle line:84%
who founded the
Templar order, they

00:28:24.190 --> 00:28:27.580 align:middle line:84%
were initiated in this
building in Constantinople.

00:28:27.580 --> 00:28:31.090 align:middle line:84%
That's now referred to as the
little Hagia Sophia Mosque.

00:28:31.090 --> 00:28:36.160 align:middle line:84%
It's a building that's
built like a giant beehive.

00:28:36.160 --> 00:28:41.080 align:middle line:84%
And it has honeycomb
floor tiles and also

00:28:41.080 --> 00:28:42.493 align:middle line:90%
honeycomb prayer turrets.

00:28:42.493 --> 00:28:45.250 align:middle line:90%


00:28:45.250 --> 00:28:49.990 align:middle line:84%
But it was originally designed
by an alchemist back in the--

00:28:49.990 --> 00:28:52.160 align:middle line:90%
clear back in the 300s.

00:28:52.160 --> 00:28:54.940 align:middle line:84%
And it became a
model for what was

00:28:54.940 --> 00:29:00.730 align:middle line:84%
to become known as the Hagia
Sophia, the giant cathedral

00:29:00.730 --> 00:29:04.050 align:middle line:84%
building that's there
in Istanbul now.

00:29:04.050 --> 00:29:07.000 align:middle line:90%


00:29:07.000 --> 00:29:10.000 align:middle line:84%
But what was built first
was this little Hagia Sophia

00:29:10.000 --> 00:29:13.120 align:middle line:84%
Mosque or building,
which was at the time

00:29:13.120 --> 00:29:15.610 align:middle line:84%
referred to as the Church of
Saint Sergius and Bacchus,

00:29:15.610 --> 00:29:18.730 align:middle line:84%
and then nearby, they built
the giant version of it--

00:29:18.730 --> 00:29:22.490 align:middle line:90%
of the Hagia Sophia.

00:29:22.490 --> 00:29:27.300 align:middle line:84%
But on the pillars
in this building

00:29:27.300 --> 00:29:32.446 align:middle line:84%
are this Egyptian ankh next
to a square and compasses.

00:29:32.446 --> 00:29:34.440 align:middle line:84%
It is the earliest
depiction of the square

00:29:34.440 --> 00:29:35.890 align:middle line:90%
and compasses in Europe.

00:29:35.890 --> 00:29:37.870 align:middle line:84%
And it was at this
Templar commandery.

00:29:37.870 --> 00:29:41.190 align:middle line:90%


00:29:41.190 --> 00:29:47.360 align:middle line:84%
This knowledge that the Templars
started gaining in Egypt,

00:29:47.360 --> 00:29:50.480 align:middle line:90%
they brought--

00:29:50.480 --> 00:29:52.880 align:middle line:84%
they tried to set
up, they wanted

00:29:52.880 --> 00:29:56.400 align:middle line:84%
to set up a new Atlantis
or a new Jerusalem.

00:29:56.400 --> 00:29:59.120 align:middle line:84%
And originally, they
tried to do this in Europe

00:29:59.120 --> 00:30:03.093 align:middle line:84%
in places like Portugal,
France, Scotland.

00:30:03.093 --> 00:30:05.936 align:middle line:90%


00:30:05.936 --> 00:30:09.230 align:middle line:84%
The climate in Europe proved to
be too volatile because there

00:30:09.230 --> 00:30:13.070 align:middle line:84%
was too much fighting
and too much control

00:30:13.070 --> 00:30:15.410 align:middle line:84%
of the church and
the monarchy for them

00:30:15.410 --> 00:30:17.110 align:middle line:90%
to really do that there.

00:30:17.110 --> 00:30:18.390 align:middle line:90%
They tried.

00:30:18.390 --> 00:30:21.830 align:middle line:84%
In fact, they even set up an
international banking system

00:30:21.830 --> 00:30:26.180 align:middle line:84%
specifically to try
to get money out

00:30:26.180 --> 00:30:28.550 align:middle line:84%
of the hands of these
power structures

00:30:28.550 --> 00:30:31.400 align:middle line:84%
and back into the
hands of the people.

00:30:31.400 --> 00:30:33.570 align:middle line:84%
But it proved to
be too difficult.

00:30:33.570 --> 00:30:37.390 align:middle line:84%
So they set their
sights on the Americas.

00:30:37.390 --> 00:30:41.920 align:middle line:84%
They knew there was this
land across the Atlantic.

00:30:41.920 --> 00:30:45.940 align:middle line:84%
There was mention of it in the--
again at Elephantine Island

00:30:45.940 --> 00:30:48.040 align:middle line:84%
where they had one
of the preceptories,

00:30:48.040 --> 00:30:50.750 align:middle line:84%
but also in other
places as well.

00:30:50.750 --> 00:30:53.470 align:middle line:84%
And so they set to
work setting that up

00:30:53.470 --> 00:30:58.100 align:middle line:84%
in North America, which
was to become the United

00:30:58.100 --> 00:30:59.400 align:middle line:90%
States of America.

00:30:59.400 --> 00:31:04.820 align:middle line:84%
And hence this is why we have
all of these Egyptian style

00:31:04.820 --> 00:31:07.350 align:middle line:84%
things here in the
United States now.

00:31:07.350 --> 00:31:09.635 align:middle line:90%
In fact, when Washington--

00:31:09.635 --> 00:31:12.380 align:middle line:84%
a picture on the left, this
is the original designs

00:31:12.380 --> 00:31:15.590 align:middle line:84%
for Washington, D.C.
And it was designed

00:31:15.590 --> 00:31:18.690 align:middle line:84%
to be a giant
Egyptian necropolis.

00:31:18.690 --> 00:31:21.153 align:middle line:84%
That was originally how
Washington, D.C. was designed,

00:31:21.153 --> 00:31:23.070 align:middle line:84%
specifically because
they were trying to bring

00:31:23.070 --> 00:31:26.820 align:middle line:90%
that knowledge back from Egypt.

00:31:26.820 --> 00:31:28.540 align:middle line:90%
Here this is at New York.

00:31:28.540 --> 00:31:30.510 align:middle line:84%
That's one of
those Obelisks that

00:31:30.510 --> 00:31:31.950 align:middle line:84%
had been brought
back from Egypt,

00:31:31.950 --> 00:31:34.530 align:middle line:90%
but it was one of the tiny ones.

00:31:34.530 --> 00:31:40.480 align:middle line:84%
But it took tremendous effort
to even get that thing moved.

00:31:40.480 --> 00:31:42.850 align:middle line:84%
They had to build
a boat around it.

00:31:42.850 --> 00:31:46.020 align:middle line:84%
And actually, they
originally tried it

00:31:46.020 --> 00:31:48.540 align:middle line:84%
with a different
Obelisk and it broke.

00:31:48.540 --> 00:31:50.560 align:middle line:84%
And so they couldn't
use that one.

00:31:50.560 --> 00:31:52.890 align:middle line:84%
And so then they got this
one, which was smaller,

00:31:52.890 --> 00:31:55.070 align:middle line:84%
and they were able to
set it up in New York.

00:31:55.070 --> 00:31:58.610 align:middle line:90%


00:31:58.610 --> 00:32:03.920 align:middle line:84%
Some of the other stuff that
the Templars were pulling from,

00:32:03.920 --> 00:32:06.620 align:middle line:90%
the Egyptian goddess Isis.

00:32:06.620 --> 00:32:10.670 align:middle line:84%
Her story, as it
got moved forward

00:32:10.670 --> 00:32:14.220 align:middle line:84%
into what was to
become Christianity,

00:32:14.220 --> 00:32:16.200 align:middle line:84%
there was this
transition period.

00:32:16.200 --> 00:32:18.440 align:middle line:84%
There was a group
known as the Gnostics,

00:32:18.440 --> 00:32:21.480 align:middle line:84%
and the Templars came out
of this Gnostic tradition.

00:32:21.480 --> 00:32:23.460 align:middle line:84%
They came out of these
Gnostic families.

00:32:23.460 --> 00:32:25.910 align:middle line:84%
Gnostic just comes from
the Greek word "gnosis"

00:32:25.910 --> 00:32:30.750 align:middle line:84%
which means divine
experiential knowledge.

00:32:30.750 --> 00:32:32.400 align:middle line:84%
The Gnostics believed
that you didn't

00:32:32.400 --> 00:32:34.650 align:middle line:90%
need a priest to get to heaven.

00:32:34.650 --> 00:32:36.510 align:middle line:84%
That anybody, through
their own efforts,

00:32:36.510 --> 00:32:40.260 align:middle line:84%
could tap into this
higher consciousness

00:32:40.260 --> 00:32:43.810 align:middle line:84%
and could experience this
gnosis, this divine knowledge.

00:32:43.810 --> 00:32:48.490 align:middle line:90%


00:32:48.490 --> 00:32:52.600 align:middle line:84%
And their myths, they
started borrowing--

00:32:52.600 --> 00:32:54.310 align:middle line:84%
you'll see in the
Gnostic literature,

00:32:54.310 --> 00:32:57.460 align:middle line:84%
they borrowed a lot from
Egyptian ancient Egyptian

00:32:57.460 --> 00:32:58.930 align:middle line:90%
sources.

00:32:58.930 --> 00:33:02.620 align:middle line:84%
In fact, many of
the Gnostic texts

00:33:02.620 --> 00:33:08.740 align:middle line:84%
that came out of the Nag
Hammadi library were from Egypt.

00:33:08.740 --> 00:33:15.620 align:middle line:84%
And they mention not
only Apocryphal texts

00:33:15.620 --> 00:33:18.090 align:middle line:84%
of the Old Testament
and the New Testament,

00:33:18.090 --> 00:33:22.820 align:middle line:84%
but there is also texts related
to Hermes, Trismegistus, who

00:33:22.820 --> 00:33:26.270 align:middle line:84%
was the creator of alchemy that
were found within these Nag

00:33:26.270 --> 00:33:30.260 align:middle line:84%
Hammadi texts, thus strongly
suggesting that the people that

00:33:30.260 --> 00:33:34.440 align:middle line:84%
were composing these texts were
looking at all these traditions.

00:33:34.440 --> 00:33:36.050 align:middle line:84%
Well, within the
Gnostic tradition,

00:33:36.050 --> 00:33:39.440 align:middle line:84%
the goddess Isis
became transformed

00:33:39.440 --> 00:33:41.840 align:middle line:90%
into a figure known as Sophia.

00:33:41.840 --> 00:33:44.610 align:middle line:84%
And Sophia literally
means wisdom.

00:33:44.610 --> 00:33:46.620 align:middle line:90%
She was the goddess of wisdom.

00:33:46.620 --> 00:33:49.850 align:middle line:84%
And this was something that the
Templars were very concerned

00:33:49.850 --> 00:33:50.700 align:middle line:90%
about.

00:33:50.700 --> 00:33:54.860 align:middle line:84%
They believed that the
Gnostic myths talk about how

00:33:54.860 --> 00:33:57.240 align:middle line:90%
there was this goddess Sophia.

00:33:57.240 --> 00:33:59.690 align:middle line:90%
She incarnated into the world.

00:33:59.690 --> 00:34:03.390 align:middle line:84%
She got totally absorbed
into it at first.

00:34:03.390 --> 00:34:05.450 align:middle line:84%
In fact, the texts
say she started

00:34:05.450 --> 00:34:07.490 align:middle line:90%
copulating with everything.

00:34:07.490 --> 00:34:10.329 align:middle line:90%
She just kind of went nuts.

00:34:10.329 --> 00:34:12.139 align:middle line:84%
And as a result of
this, she started

00:34:12.139 --> 00:34:16.250 align:middle line:84%
producing all kinds
of other beings

00:34:16.250 --> 00:34:18.600 align:middle line:90%
like that she gave birth to.

00:34:18.600 --> 00:34:22.469 align:middle line:84%
And this was a real
problem at first.

00:34:22.469 --> 00:34:27.710 align:middle line:84%
And then eventually, she came to
work her way through this mess

00:34:27.710 --> 00:34:31.639 align:middle line:84%
and she reaped wed with
the Christos, which was

00:34:31.639 --> 00:34:33.590 align:middle line:90%
the universal consciousness.

00:34:33.590 --> 00:34:39.972 align:middle line:84%
And so the Gnostics
believed that the story

00:34:39.972 --> 00:34:43.440 align:middle line:84%
of the goddess of wisdom
Sophia represented

00:34:43.440 --> 00:34:46.500 align:middle line:84%
the human soul
and the experience

00:34:46.500 --> 00:34:47.770 align:middle line:90%
that we all go through.

00:34:47.770 --> 00:34:50.310 align:middle line:84%
When we incarnate
into this world,

00:34:50.310 --> 00:34:54.583 align:middle line:90%
we get totally absorbed in it.

00:34:54.583 --> 00:34:58.180 align:middle line:84%
We copulate our way out
of it to a certain degree.

00:34:58.180 --> 00:35:02.010 align:middle line:84%
And then eventually, after we
work through all this stuff,

00:35:02.010 --> 00:35:06.130 align:middle line:84%
we're able to see the bigger
order that unites it all.

00:35:06.130 --> 00:35:09.430 align:middle line:84%
And this is where the
gnosis comes from.

00:35:09.430 --> 00:35:11.580 align:middle line:84%
And they said this was
the divine marriage

00:35:11.580 --> 00:35:15.140 align:middle line:84%
between the Sophia
and the Christos.

00:35:15.140 --> 00:35:18.500 align:middle line:84%
The Gnostics also believed
that this was symbolically

00:35:18.500 --> 00:35:24.020 align:middle line:84%
represented within the story
of Mary Magdalene and Jesus.

00:35:24.020 --> 00:35:27.320 align:middle line:84%
And that the wedding of
Cana, really what it really

00:35:27.320 --> 00:35:31.370 align:middle line:84%
represented was this mystical
marriage of the individual soul

00:35:31.370 --> 00:35:33.710 align:middle line:90%
to the universal consciousness.

00:35:33.710 --> 00:35:37.640 align:middle line:84%
And this is why even
Paul, in his letters says,

00:35:37.640 --> 00:35:40.520 align:middle line:84%
we need to make
Christ our husband.

00:35:40.520 --> 00:35:43.040 align:middle line:84%
Well, that's kind of a
weird thing to say, right?

00:35:43.040 --> 00:35:46.870 align:middle line:84%
But the indications
are Paul had come out

00:35:46.870 --> 00:35:49.370 align:middle line:84%
of this Gnostic
tradition as well.

00:35:49.370 --> 00:35:52.610 align:middle line:84%
And I'm not going to give a
whole lecture on the Gnostics.

00:35:52.610 --> 00:35:54.770 align:middle line:84%
I could, but what
I want to point out

00:35:54.770 --> 00:35:58.430 align:middle line:84%
is this was traditionally
the depiction of Sophia.

00:35:58.430 --> 00:36:03.440 align:middle line:84%
She was depicted usually
holding a torch, sometimes

00:36:03.440 --> 00:36:06.630 align:middle line:90%
sacred tablets.

00:36:06.630 --> 00:36:10.910 align:middle line:84%
And she had a
seven-pointed crown.

00:36:10.910 --> 00:36:13.336 align:middle line:90%
Where have we seen that before?

00:36:13.336 --> 00:36:15.115 align:middle line:90%
Oh, yeah, the Statue of Liberty.

00:36:15.115 --> 00:36:17.240 align:middle line:84%
That's really what the
Statue of Liberty is, right?

00:36:17.240 --> 00:36:19.300 align:middle line:90%
It's a statue of Sophia.

00:36:19.300 --> 00:36:21.070 align:middle line:84%
And it represented
freedom because you

00:36:21.070 --> 00:36:25.690 align:middle line:84%
have to have the freedom
to experience in order

00:36:25.690 --> 00:36:27.670 align:middle line:84%
to work your way
through it in order

00:36:27.670 --> 00:36:30.290 align:middle line:84%
to come to this
universal consciousness.

00:36:30.290 --> 00:36:36.760 align:middle line:84%
Incidentally, her tablet
is also in the shape

00:36:36.760 --> 00:36:40.880 align:middle line:90%
of a Masonic keystone.

00:36:40.880 --> 00:36:42.295 align:middle line:90%
And that was on purpose.

00:36:42.295 --> 00:36:45.340 align:middle line:90%


00:36:45.340 --> 00:36:46.632 align:middle line:90%
She was also-- at her feet--

00:36:46.632 --> 00:36:47.840 align:middle line:90%
I don't have a picture of it.

00:36:47.840 --> 00:36:53.090 align:middle line:84%
She has broken chains
because she's been--

00:36:53.090 --> 00:36:58.366 align:middle line:84%
she's been freed from the
slavery of this world.

00:36:58.366 --> 00:37:00.390 align:middle line:90%
She's no longer enslaved.

00:37:00.390 --> 00:37:04.550 align:middle line:84%
Originally, this statue was
built to be a statue of Isis,

00:37:04.550 --> 00:37:09.560 align:middle line:84%
and it was designed to be put
over the Aswan Dam in Egypt.

00:37:09.560 --> 00:37:11.570 align:middle line:84%
But then they changed
their mind and gave it

00:37:11.570 --> 00:37:16.980 align:middle line:84%
to the United States instead,
which is appropriate.

00:37:16.980 --> 00:37:19.152 align:middle line:84%
Now, all throughout
the United States,

00:37:19.152 --> 00:37:20.610 align:middle line:84%
there are other
monuments like this

00:37:20.610 --> 00:37:22.470 align:middle line:84%
that have been
set up by Templars

00:37:22.470 --> 00:37:24.250 align:middle line:90%
or inspired by Templars.

00:37:24.250 --> 00:37:27.340 align:middle line:84%
This is one
particularly of Athena.

00:37:27.340 --> 00:37:31.180 align:middle line:84%
This is found in
Tennessee, in Nashville.

00:37:31.180 --> 00:37:34.330 align:middle line:84%
They created a reproduction
of the Parthenon.

00:37:34.330 --> 00:37:36.040 align:middle line:90%
You can go see it to this day.

00:37:36.040 --> 00:37:40.800 align:middle line:84%
And about 10 or 20
years ago, they actually

00:37:40.800 --> 00:37:42.540 align:middle line:90%
put this life size--

00:37:42.540 --> 00:37:47.840 align:middle line:84%
Well, this is, I mean, if I
was to stand in front of this,

00:37:47.840 --> 00:37:51.150 align:middle line:84%
I'm about as tall as these
little figures at the base.

00:37:51.150 --> 00:37:57.460 align:middle line:84%
So it gives you a sense it's
the largest indoor statue

00:37:57.460 --> 00:38:00.130 align:middle line:90%
in the United States.

00:38:00.130 --> 00:38:02.620 align:middle line:90%
And it's of Athena.

00:38:02.620 --> 00:38:05.140 align:middle line:90%
Why this was significant is--

00:38:05.140 --> 00:38:11.455 align:middle line:84%
to Templars, according
to the myths of Plato,

00:38:11.455 --> 00:38:15.430 align:middle line:84%
the goddess of
Atlantis was Athena.

00:38:15.430 --> 00:38:22.110 align:middle line:84%
And that this is actually
where the Greeks also

00:38:22.110 --> 00:38:24.430 align:middle line:90%
took this tradition from.

00:38:24.430 --> 00:38:28.740 align:middle line:84%
And that's why they named
their capital city, Athens,

00:38:28.740 --> 00:38:31.988 align:middle line:90%
after Athena.

00:38:31.988 --> 00:38:33.940 align:middle line:84%
But we have these
representations here

00:38:33.940 --> 00:38:35.740 align:middle line:84%
in the United
States for a reason.

00:38:35.740 --> 00:38:39.090 align:middle line:90%
