00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:10.868 align:middle line:90%


00:00:10.868 --> 00:00:14.310 align:middle line:90%
>> Hi, guys.

00:00:14.310 --> 00:00:17.910 align:middle line:84%
You guys, this is just
so incredible, isn't it?

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:21.130 align:middle line:84%
Like, this conference
has been amazing.

00:00:21.130 --> 00:00:23.640 align:middle line:10%
We're like inside a pyramid.

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:25.770 align:middle line:10%
How cool is that in Las Vegas?

00:00:25.770 --> 00:00:28.080 align:middle line:90%
I feel so cool.

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:31.125 align:middle line:90%
Is anyone here from Las Vegas?

00:00:31.125 --> 00:00:32.158 align:middle line:90%
Oh, no way.

00:00:32.158 --> 00:00:33.825 align:middle line:84%
So it's probably not
cool to you though.

00:00:33.825 --> 00:00:38.470 align:middle line:84%
[LAUGHS] Anyone from
a different planet?

00:00:38.470 --> 00:00:40.150 align:middle line:90%
Yay, straight As.

00:00:40.150 --> 00:00:42.640 align:middle line:90%
My tribe.

00:00:42.640 --> 00:00:47.620 align:middle line:84%
So anyway, I got into all this
stuff just totally by accident.

00:00:47.620 --> 00:00:52.540 align:middle line:84%
When I was younger,
I had so many issues.

00:00:52.540 --> 00:00:55.510 align:middle line:84%
I was overweight,
really overweight.

00:00:55.510 --> 00:00:57.550 align:middle line:90%
I had phobias and fears.

00:00:57.550 --> 00:01:00.790 align:middle line:84%
And I had OCD that
was so debilitating

00:01:00.790 --> 00:01:03.790 align:middle line:84%
that I had to open and
close drawers and flick

00:01:03.790 --> 00:01:06.940 align:middle line:84%
on and off light switches
just to leave the house.

00:01:06.940 --> 00:01:11.410 align:middle line:84%
And then on top of that, I was
like this hypochondriac super

00:01:11.410 --> 00:01:12.520 align:middle line:90%
manifestor.

00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:15.580 align:middle line:84%
So if you had a problem
and I thought about it,

00:01:15.580 --> 00:01:17.890 align:middle line:84%
I could get your problem
from thinking about it.

00:01:17.890 --> 00:01:19.780 align:middle line:90%
It was like so annoying.

00:01:19.780 --> 00:01:24.430 align:middle line:84%
And so I had to go to therapy
because nothing really--

00:01:24.430 --> 00:01:25.750 align:middle line:90%
I never got better.

00:01:25.750 --> 00:01:27.070 align:middle line:90%
I kept getting worse.

00:01:27.070 --> 00:01:30.660 align:middle line:84%
And my parents didn't
know what to do with me.

00:01:30.660 --> 00:01:33.540 align:middle line:84%
So it was in therapy I
learned a lot about therapy.

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:35.310 align:middle line:84%
And I thought, oh
my gosh, I'm going

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:37.410 align:middle line:84%
to help everyone because
I don't want anyone

00:01:37.410 --> 00:01:39.270 align:middle line:90%
to suffer like I suffered.

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:41.490 align:middle line:84%
I mean, my whole
childhood was pretty much

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:44.020 align:middle line:84%
suffering, and then
more suffering.

00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:45.660 align:middle line:90%
And it sucked.

00:01:45.660 --> 00:01:48.390 align:middle line:84%
And so I thought, I'm going
to be the best therapist

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:49.750 align:middle line:90%
and help everyone.

00:01:49.750 --> 00:01:52.365 align:middle line:84%
And so I decided I was
going to be a psychologist.

00:01:52.365 --> 00:01:53.490 align:middle line:90%
That's what I wanted to do.

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:55.538 align:middle line:90%
Those were my childhood dreams.

00:01:55.538 --> 00:01:56.580 align:middle line:90%
What are you going to be?

00:01:56.580 --> 00:01:59.550 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to be the
best psychologist.

00:01:59.550 --> 00:02:04.200 align:middle line:84%
So I went to college to become
a psychologist, which is really

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:05.820 align:middle line:90%
weird that I do this now.

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:09.330 align:middle line:90%
But that's how life works.

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:12.360 align:middle line:84%
Something really
life-changing happened to me

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:13.860 align:middle line:90%
when I went to college.

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:17.970 align:middle line:84%
So about two and a half
months after I got to college,

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:21.480 align:middle line:84%
I went back home to my family's
house for the first time.

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:23.580 align:middle line:84%
And there's this little
mirror that you see

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:25.170 align:middle line:90%
when you walk through the door.

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:28.140 align:middle line:84%
And when I walk through
my parents' door,

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:31.600 align:middle line:84%
I looked at my reflection,
and my jaw just dropped.

00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:37.270 align:middle line:84%
I was like, while I was away
for just a couple months,

00:02:37.270 --> 00:02:41.380 align:middle line:84%
I had forgotten to
have all my problems

00:02:41.380 --> 00:02:45.190 align:middle line:84%
because I lost a considerable
amount of weight.

00:02:45.190 --> 00:02:46.960 align:middle line:90%
And I was eating pizza.

00:02:46.960 --> 00:02:48.760 align:middle line:90%
I mean, I was drinking beer.

00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:50.260 align:middle line:90%
I was a freshman.

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:52.810 align:middle line:84%
I hadn't done
anything different.

00:02:52.810 --> 00:02:57.200 align:middle line:10%
And then I just stared
at myself like, oh, yeah,

00:02:57.200 --> 00:02:59.420 align:middle line:10%
what about the opening
and closing drawers?

00:02:59.420 --> 00:03:01.640 align:middle line:10%
What about all my problems?

00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:07.100 align:middle line:10%
And it dawned on me that because
I had changed my environment,

00:03:07.100 --> 00:03:09.890 align:middle line:10%
I had changed my
thought patterns.

00:03:09.890 --> 00:03:14.690 align:middle line:84%
And then I thought, wow,
every problem I've ever had

00:03:14.690 --> 00:03:19.800 align:middle line:84%
has been a thought pattern
that I was repeating to myself.

00:03:19.800 --> 00:03:23.780 align:middle line:84%
So with this aha moment,
from that moment forward,

00:03:23.780 --> 00:03:26.610 align:middle line:84%
I've realized that if I
ever have any problems,

00:03:26.610 --> 00:03:30.020 align:middle line:90%
I go about changing my patterns.

00:03:30.020 --> 00:03:32.960 align:middle line:84%
And I can literally
control anything

00:03:32.960 --> 00:03:35.930 align:middle line:90%
I want to in my lifetime now.

00:03:35.930 --> 00:03:40.760 align:middle line:84%
So it's incredibly valuable
to understand how much power

00:03:40.760 --> 00:03:44.000 align:middle line:90%
our thought patterns have.

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:45.770 align:middle line:84%
But I didn't really
have anybody to talk

00:03:45.770 --> 00:03:48.440 align:middle line:90%
to about this, so I graduated.

00:03:48.440 --> 00:03:50.750 align:middle line:84%
And then before going
to graduate school,

00:03:50.750 --> 00:03:52.880 align:middle line:90%
I had to do an internship.

00:03:52.880 --> 00:03:55.970 align:middle line:84%
And my job was to
basically counsel people

00:03:55.970 --> 00:03:58.250 align:middle line:84%
and give them medication
because that's

00:03:58.250 --> 00:04:01.490 align:middle line:84%
what I had to do as a
counselor at this halfway house

00:04:01.490 --> 00:04:04.130 align:middle line:90%
where I was doing my internship.

00:04:04.130 --> 00:04:08.330 align:middle line:84%
And I felt-- and this
is my own experience--

00:04:08.330 --> 00:04:11.000 align:middle line:84%
that within about a
week of working there

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:12.680 align:middle line:84%
that everything I
learned in college

00:04:12.680 --> 00:04:16.579 align:middle line:84%
was a lie because no
one got any better.

00:04:16.579 --> 00:04:18.800 align:middle line:84%
I mean, there were
no success stories.

00:04:18.800 --> 00:04:22.880 align:middle line:84%
In '97, the protocol, if a
person was talking to aliens,

00:04:22.880 --> 00:04:25.160 align:middle line:84%
was to consider
them schizophrenic

00:04:25.160 --> 00:04:27.080 align:middle line:90%
and heavily medicate them.

00:04:27.080 --> 00:04:28.470 align:middle line:90%
And these were people.

00:04:28.470 --> 00:04:31.920 align:middle line:84%
And I thought, wait a minute,
I wanted to help people.

00:04:31.920 --> 00:04:35.280 align:middle line:84%
This just seemed like it
didn't help anybody at all.

00:04:35.280 --> 00:04:36.890 align:middle line:90%
Everybody was stuck there.

00:04:36.890 --> 00:04:40.400 align:middle line:84%
People were drooling on the
couch if I gave them medication.

00:04:40.400 --> 00:04:42.830 align:middle line:84%
No one was affected
at all by any

00:04:42.830 --> 00:04:44.160 align:middle line:90%
of the counseling techniques.

00:04:44.160 --> 00:04:46.950 align:middle line:84%
They just said the same
problem over and over again.

00:04:46.950 --> 00:04:50.380 align:middle line:84%
Where is the solution
here for these people?

00:04:50.380 --> 00:04:52.080 align:middle line:90%
And I got so disheartened.

00:04:52.080 --> 00:04:54.510 align:middle line:84%
I thought, I can't
believe that this

00:04:54.510 --> 00:04:58.410 align:middle line:84%
is the culmination of everything
I've studied in school.

00:04:58.410 --> 00:05:00.750 align:middle line:90%
And this doesn't even work.

00:05:00.750 --> 00:05:03.310 align:middle line:90%
I was like, this is it?

00:05:03.310 --> 00:05:05.940 align:middle line:84%
That's all we have
for these people?

00:05:05.940 --> 00:05:08.280 align:middle line:90%
It wasn't OK with me.

00:05:08.280 --> 00:05:10.740 align:middle line:90%
So I eventually found hypnosis.

00:05:10.740 --> 00:05:15.510 align:middle line:84%
And in order to become a
master hypnotist in 2009,

00:05:15.510 --> 00:05:18.450 align:middle line:84%
you had to do lose weight,
quit smoking, and past life

00:05:18.450 --> 00:05:19.320 align:middle line:90%
regression.

00:05:19.320 --> 00:05:22.140 align:middle line:84%
But the reason I really
wanted to do hypnosis

00:05:22.140 --> 00:05:25.290 align:middle line:84%
is I remembered
in college that we

00:05:25.290 --> 00:05:29.160 align:middle line:84%
had one class where we learned
about regression hypnosis.

00:05:29.160 --> 00:05:31.890 align:middle line:84%
And I wanted to do
childhood regression.

00:05:31.890 --> 00:05:35.160 align:middle line:84%
I wanted to regress
somebody in their childhood

00:05:35.160 --> 00:05:37.230 align:middle line:84%
to the root cause
of their issue.

00:05:37.230 --> 00:05:39.990 align:middle line:84%
I didn't know anything
about past life regression.

00:05:39.990 --> 00:05:41.910 align:middle line:84%
I really didn't
even believe in it.

00:05:41.910 --> 00:05:44.610 align:middle line:84%
I wasn't very
spiritual whatsoever.

00:05:44.610 --> 00:05:47.880 align:middle line:84%
I didn't grow up with
spirituality or religion

00:05:47.880 --> 00:05:49.090 align:middle line:90%
or anything like that.

00:05:49.090 --> 00:05:53.780 align:middle line:84%
So it wasn't a part of my
belief system at the time.

00:05:53.780 --> 00:05:56.300 align:middle line:84%
But I had to do past
life regression.

00:05:56.300 --> 00:05:59.480 align:middle line:84%
It was forced in
fact because in order

00:05:59.480 --> 00:06:02.490 align:middle line:84%
to become a master
hypnotist, I had to do it.

00:06:02.490 --> 00:06:04.310 align:middle line:84%
I had to do past
life regression,

00:06:04.310 --> 00:06:09.560 align:middle line:84%
lose weight, quit smoking, and
regression techniques, basically

00:06:09.560 --> 00:06:12.250 align:middle line:90%
childhood regression.

00:06:12.250 --> 00:06:15.490 align:middle line:10%
But right away, I
learned and it seemed

00:06:15.490 --> 00:06:17.500 align:middle line:10%
like within the first
week that people

00:06:17.500 --> 00:06:19.480 align:middle line:10%
could come in for
just one session

00:06:19.480 --> 00:06:23.260 align:middle line:10%
and heal themselves in these
past life regressions, where

00:06:23.260 --> 00:06:26.680 align:middle line:10%
lose weight and quit
smoking wasn't even

00:06:26.680 --> 00:06:28.210 align:middle line:10%
really that effective.

00:06:28.210 --> 00:06:30.630 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it was like putting
a Band-Aid on cancer.

00:06:30.630 --> 00:06:33.110 align:middle line:84%
It wasn't getting to the
root cause of anything.

00:06:33.110 --> 00:06:36.850 align:middle line:84%
So I decided, well, I want
to do something that works.

00:06:36.850 --> 00:06:38.890 align:middle line:84%
So I studied with
Dr. Brian Weiss.

00:06:38.890 --> 00:06:40.540 align:middle line:90%
He was my first teacher.

00:06:40.540 --> 00:06:42.590 align:middle line:84%
And I got really
good at his method.

00:06:42.590 --> 00:06:43.390 align:middle line:90%
I loved it.

00:06:43.390 --> 00:06:45.380 align:middle line:84%
And I did it for
many, many years.

00:06:45.380 --> 00:06:46.240 align:middle line:90%
And I love him.

00:06:46.240 --> 00:06:47.870 align:middle line:90%
He's super sweet.

00:06:47.870 --> 00:06:51.520 align:middle line:84%
And then I felt like something
in my life is missing.

00:06:51.520 --> 00:06:53.590 align:middle line:90%
I just don't know what it is.

00:06:53.590 --> 00:06:55.250 align:middle line:90%
But I feel this feeling.

00:06:55.250 --> 00:06:56.680 align:middle line:90%
And I just can't figure it out.

00:06:56.680 --> 00:06:59.270 align:middle line:84%
I feel like there's
something missing in my life.

00:06:59.270 --> 00:07:01.600 align:middle line:90%
So I contacted this psychic.

00:07:01.600 --> 00:07:06.130 align:middle line:10%
And her name's
Emmanuelle McIntosh.

00:07:06.130 --> 00:07:07.960 align:middle line:90%
I contacted this psychic.

00:07:07.960 --> 00:07:11.200 align:middle line:84%
And she said, oh my gosh,
this is the easiest reading

00:07:11.200 --> 00:07:12.005 align:middle line:90%
I've ever done.

00:07:12.005 --> 00:07:12.880 align:middle line:90%
We've become friends.

00:07:12.880 --> 00:07:14.680 align:middle line:84%
And we always joke
about this now.

00:07:14.680 --> 00:07:17.500 align:middle line:84%
She's like everybody
has future potentials.

00:07:17.500 --> 00:07:21.040 align:middle line:84%
But you have one
really clear one.

00:07:21.040 --> 00:07:24.130 align:middle line:84%
You're supposed to do
Dolores Cannon's technique.

00:07:24.130 --> 00:07:26.680 align:middle line:84%
That's why you feel like
something's missing.

00:07:26.680 --> 00:07:29.530 align:middle line:84%
And you're going to
get really good at it.

00:07:29.530 --> 00:07:31.810 align:middle line:84%
And you're going to
be writing books.

00:07:31.810 --> 00:07:34.330 align:middle line:84%
And then you're going to
be teaching about them.

00:07:34.330 --> 00:07:37.030 align:middle line:84%
And you're going to be
speaking about this information

00:07:37.030 --> 00:07:38.590 align:middle line:90%
all over the world.

00:07:38.590 --> 00:07:42.980 align:middle line:10%
And I was so mad I wasted
money on another psychic.

00:07:42.980 --> 00:07:45.100 align:middle line:90%
I was like, what the heck?

00:07:45.100 --> 00:07:48.560 align:middle line:84%
There goes another
$100 down the drain

00:07:48.560 --> 00:07:51.760 align:middle line:84%
because I thought she
totally had me confused.

00:07:51.760 --> 00:07:53.650 align:middle line:84%
And I really thought
she must have

00:07:53.650 --> 00:07:56.170 align:middle line:84%
gotten me confused with
the person before me

00:07:56.170 --> 00:08:00.740 align:middle line:84%
or after because I would
never write a book, I mean,

00:08:00.740 --> 00:08:04.390 align:middle line:84%
jeez, or speak in
front of people.

00:08:04.390 --> 00:08:06.180 align:middle line:90%
Why would I do that?

00:08:06.180 --> 00:08:08.850 align:middle line:84%
And who is this
Dolores Cannon person?

00:08:08.850 --> 00:08:10.860 align:middle line:90%
So I was just so frustrated.

00:08:10.860 --> 00:08:14.350 align:middle line:84%
I didn't even look up
this Dolores Cannon person

00:08:14.350 --> 00:08:19.720 align:middle line:84%
for like six months later
until Dolores actually

00:08:19.720 --> 00:08:22.150 align:middle line:90%
popped up on my computer.

00:08:22.150 --> 00:08:26.000 align:middle line:84%
And when I saw what
she was talking about,

00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:29.660 align:middle line:84%
I instantly felt this
connection to it.

00:08:29.660 --> 00:08:32.440 align:middle line:84%
And I thought, hmm, I'm
going to check this out.

00:08:32.440 --> 00:08:35.409 align:middle line:84%
So I looked deeper
into what she taught.

00:08:35.409 --> 00:08:37.929 align:middle line:84%
And as soon as I
did, it was like I

00:08:37.929 --> 00:08:41.919 align:middle line:84%
had the goosebumps, full
recognition where I was like,

00:08:41.919 --> 00:08:45.190 align:middle line:84%
oh my gosh, this is
what I'm missing.

00:08:45.190 --> 00:08:47.920 align:middle line:84%
And sure enough, just
like the psychic said,

00:08:47.920 --> 00:08:53.530 align:middle line:84%
I worked my way up from being
a level one to a level three,

00:08:53.530 --> 00:08:57.680 align:middle line:84%
writing books and speaking
about it all over the world.

00:08:57.680 --> 00:09:02.860 align:middle line:10%
So what is this amazing method,
QHHT, stands for quantum healing

00:09:02.860 --> 00:09:04.090 align:middle line:10%
hypnosis technique.

00:09:04.090 --> 00:09:07.810 align:middle line:10%
And the method that I do and
the way that I write my books

00:09:07.810 --> 00:09:10.150 align:middle line:10%
is I use Dolores
Cannon's method.

00:09:10.150 --> 00:09:12.070 align:middle line:84%
Dolores Cannon
founded this method

00:09:12.070 --> 00:09:14.390 align:middle line:90%
after 45 years of research.

00:09:14.390 --> 00:09:17.870 align:middle line:84%
And basically what sets
this method apart, which,

00:09:17.870 --> 00:09:20.520 align:middle line:84%
in my opinion, is the best
method that I've ever done--

00:09:20.520 --> 00:09:22.460 align:middle line:84%
and I've done many
different things--

00:09:22.460 --> 00:09:25.220 align:middle line:90%
is the real goal of a session.

00:09:25.220 --> 00:09:27.380 align:middle line:84%
It's not only to
regress a person.

00:09:27.380 --> 00:09:30.590 align:middle line:84%
But you bring them to the
very deepest level of trance.

00:09:30.590 --> 00:09:34.940 align:middle line:84%
And you access their all-knowing
higher consciousness.

00:09:34.940 --> 00:09:38.120 align:middle line:84%
And in that way, you
can find out anything.

00:09:38.120 --> 00:09:41.360 align:middle line:84%
I mean, you can find
out who a person really

00:09:41.360 --> 00:09:43.340 align:middle line:90%
is, their true purpose.

00:09:43.340 --> 00:09:46.010 align:middle line:84%
And they can even
heal themselves.

00:09:46.010 --> 00:09:48.590 align:middle line:90%
And the healing is so fantastic.

00:09:48.590 --> 00:09:50.120 align:middle line:84%
Her daughter,
Julia Cannon, wrote

00:09:50.120 --> 00:09:51.870 align:middle line:90%
a book called "Soul Speak."

00:09:51.870 --> 00:09:56.540 align:middle line:84%
But it's really all about how
the body is just a messenger.

00:09:56.540 --> 00:09:59.480 align:middle line:84%
So the body is just always
sending us messages.

00:09:59.480 --> 00:10:00.920 align:middle line:90%
It's on our side.

00:10:00.920 --> 00:10:03.770 align:middle line:84%
And the body is a
literal messenger too.

00:10:03.770 --> 00:10:06.980 align:middle line:84%
Usually what's
happening, if you have

00:10:06.980 --> 00:10:09.920 align:middle line:84%
an issue on your right side,
is it something happening

00:10:09.920 --> 00:10:10.820 align:middle line:90%
right now?

00:10:10.820 --> 00:10:14.670 align:middle line:84%
Anything on the left side is
something from the past usually.

00:10:14.670 --> 00:10:17.930 align:middle line:84%
And so if you just look at what
message the body is sending you,

00:10:17.930 --> 00:10:19.250 align:middle line:90%
it's pretty literal.

00:10:19.250 --> 00:10:22.250 align:middle line:84%
Like if your left
hand is hurting,

00:10:22.250 --> 00:10:25.190 align:middle line:84%
a lot of times it's from holding
on too tightly to something

00:10:25.190 --> 00:10:26.360 align:middle line:90%
from the past.

00:10:26.360 --> 00:10:28.760 align:middle line:84%
Or if your right
hand has issues,

00:10:28.760 --> 00:10:32.090 align:middle line:84%
you could be holding on
too tightly to something,

00:10:32.090 --> 00:10:35.120 align:middle line:84%
feet could be
stability or movement,

00:10:35.120 --> 00:10:37.710 align:middle line:90%
same with the mobility joints.

00:10:37.710 --> 00:10:40.340 align:middle line:84%
So the body is a
literal messenger.

00:10:40.340 --> 00:10:41.960 align:middle line:84%
And that's why in
these sessions,

00:10:41.960 --> 00:10:45.500 align:middle line:84%
it's so easy for people to
really tune into themselves

00:10:45.500 --> 00:10:47.750 align:middle line:90%
and get the message.

00:10:47.750 --> 00:10:50.560 align:middle line:10%
So my introduction
to extraterrestrials

00:10:50.560 --> 00:10:55.320 align:middle line:10%
is just like everything in my
life, just happened by accident.

00:10:55.320 --> 00:10:59.610 align:middle line:84%
I wanted to take the
level three QHHT class.

00:10:59.610 --> 00:11:01.770 align:middle line:90%
So I needed a volunteer.

00:11:01.770 --> 00:11:06.750 align:middle line:84%
And it was on the spot because
I had been really wanting

00:11:06.750 --> 00:11:08.310 align:middle line:90%
this class to be in Florida.

00:11:08.310 --> 00:11:10.920 align:middle line:84%
And all of a sudden,
it was in Florida.

00:11:10.920 --> 00:11:13.140 align:middle line:84%
And I thought, oh my God,
I got to find somebody

00:11:13.140 --> 00:11:16.890 align:middle line:84%
to regress that won't mind
me actually videotaping them.

00:11:16.890 --> 00:11:21.090 align:middle line:84%
I wanted somebody that was not
a paying client because I just

00:11:21.090 --> 00:11:22.770 align:middle line:84%
wanted someone
that wouldn't care,

00:11:22.770 --> 00:11:24.450 align:middle line:84%
that wasn't into
any of this stuff

00:11:24.450 --> 00:11:27.570 align:middle line:84%
really so I could
videotape them and take it.

00:11:27.570 --> 00:11:31.460 align:middle line:90%
So I asked my friend Jen.

00:11:31.460 --> 00:11:35.270 align:middle line:84%
And I said, Jen, would you
mind doing this with me?

00:11:35.270 --> 00:11:38.000 align:middle line:84%
And I knew that Jen wasn't
into any of this stuff

00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:41.130 align:middle line:84%
because I had been friends
with her for 10 years.

00:11:41.130 --> 00:11:43.430 align:middle line:10%
And we used to sit
on the playground

00:11:43.430 --> 00:11:46.730 align:middle line:10%
together and watch our kids play
after school because she was

00:11:46.730 --> 00:11:48.350 align:middle line:10%
a teacher at the kids' school.

00:11:48.350 --> 00:11:51.170 align:middle line:10%
And we would always
just be together

00:11:51.170 --> 00:11:54.320 align:middle line:10%
and talk about surface
level conversations

00:11:54.320 --> 00:11:56.750 align:middle line:10%
because she wasn't into
any of the spiritual stuff.

00:11:56.750 --> 00:11:59.360 align:middle line:84%
A couple times I tried to
bring things up to her.

00:11:59.360 --> 00:12:02.510 align:middle line:84%
But she really
wasn't interested.

00:12:02.510 --> 00:12:06.577 align:middle line:84%
Those friends where you're like,
oh my gosh, this is so cool.

00:12:06.577 --> 00:12:07.910 align:middle line:90%
And they're just not interested.

00:12:07.910 --> 00:12:09.840 align:middle line:90%
So you drop it.

00:12:09.840 --> 00:12:13.550 align:middle line:84%
So I asked her if she
would be my volunteer.

00:12:13.550 --> 00:12:15.420 align:middle line:90%
And I told her what I was doing.

00:12:15.420 --> 00:12:20.420 align:middle line:84%
I said, I want to regress
you, bring you into trance,

00:12:20.420 --> 00:12:24.830 align:middle line:84%
and then you might see
a past life or lives.

00:12:24.830 --> 00:12:25.910 align:middle line:90%
We'll see.

00:12:25.910 --> 00:12:30.120 align:middle line:84%
But the main goal of this really
is to access your higher self,

00:12:30.120 --> 00:12:33.060 align:middle line:84%
and then you can find
out anything you want to.

00:12:33.060 --> 00:12:36.690 align:middle line:10%
You can find out who you
really are, your true purpose.

00:12:36.690 --> 00:12:39.130 align:middle line:84%
And I told her, you
can heal yourself.

00:12:39.130 --> 00:12:44.070 align:middle line:84%
So my friend Jen said, I didn't
really realize you did that.

00:12:44.070 --> 00:12:49.170 align:middle line:10%
And I thought, oh my God, we've
been friends like 10 years,

00:12:49.170 --> 00:12:51.360 align:middle line:10%
like yeah, OK.

00:12:51.360 --> 00:12:55.200 align:middle line:84%
But she said, I have been
looking for something like this.

00:12:55.200 --> 00:12:58.350 align:middle line:84%
It pissed me off
a little more when

00:12:58.350 --> 00:13:02.160 align:middle line:84%
she said she is suffering
from this brain condition,

00:13:02.160 --> 00:13:06.600 align:middle line:84%
which she hadn't told anyone
about, only her husband.

00:13:06.600 --> 00:13:10.530 align:middle line:84%
But her brain condition was
called pseudotumor cerebri.

00:13:10.530 --> 00:13:13.380 align:middle line:84%
And basically what it
was was this flooding

00:13:13.380 --> 00:13:15.870 align:middle line:84%
of the spinal
fluid in her brain.

00:13:15.870 --> 00:13:17.970 align:middle line:84%
And she was working
really closely

00:13:17.970 --> 00:13:20.040 align:middle line:84%
with this team of
medical specialists

00:13:20.040 --> 00:13:22.230 align:middle line:90%
at the University of Miami.

00:13:22.230 --> 00:13:24.870 align:middle line:84%
And they told her there
is no cure for this,

00:13:24.870 --> 00:13:26.790 align:middle line:84%
that the best they
could do was to give her

00:13:26.790 --> 00:13:28.710 align:middle line:90%
this heavy-duty medication.

00:13:28.710 --> 00:13:32.070 align:middle line:84%
But even with the medication,
she might have 20 years.

00:13:32.070 --> 00:13:34.590 align:middle line:90%
Now, Jen here is 32.

00:13:34.590 --> 00:13:38.370 align:middle line:84%
And she had three young
children, so she was desperate.

00:13:38.370 --> 00:13:44.000 align:middle line:84%
So she was so desperate, she
would do this session with me.

00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:47.120 align:middle line:84%
So I regressed her
in our first session.

00:13:47.120 --> 00:13:49.580 align:middle line:10%
And all of a sudden, as she's--

00:13:49.580 --> 00:13:52.580 align:middle line:10%
under hypnosis,
she all of a sudden

00:13:52.580 --> 00:13:57.200 align:middle line:10%
starts to remember this
amazing ancient society

00:13:57.200 --> 00:13:59.840 align:middle line:10%
in so many details.

00:13:59.840 --> 00:14:02.810 align:middle line:84%
And I knew she knew
nothing about this

00:14:02.810 --> 00:14:06.770 align:middle line:84%
before because she not
only didn't know about it,

00:14:06.770 --> 00:14:08.360 align:middle line:90%
she didn't really believe in it.

00:14:08.360 --> 00:14:10.970 align:middle line:10%
But here she is recounting
in so many details

00:14:10.970 --> 00:14:14.240 align:middle line:10%
this beautiful society
in the South Pacific

00:14:14.240 --> 00:14:17.090 align:middle line:10%
where women were
the natural leaders

00:14:17.090 --> 00:14:20.600 align:middle line:10%
and this beautiful
compassionate society.

00:14:20.600 --> 00:14:23.090 align:middle line:84%
And we came to understand
that the women were

00:14:23.090 --> 00:14:25.850 align:middle line:84%
the natural leaders
because they carried

00:14:25.850 --> 00:14:29.150 align:middle line:84%
through their subconscious,
vital information

00:14:29.150 --> 00:14:30.800 align:middle line:84%
between the mother
and the daughter.

00:14:30.800 --> 00:14:34.100 align:middle line:10%
They never had to teach their
daughters this information.

00:14:34.100 --> 00:14:36.470 align:middle line:84%
But it was really
important information

00:14:36.470 --> 00:14:39.510 align:middle line:84%
about different plants,
what different properties

00:14:39.510 --> 00:14:42.490 align:middle line:90%
the plants held within them.

00:14:42.490 --> 00:14:47.880 align:middle line:84%
So as she's recounting
this amazing lifetime, all

00:14:47.880 --> 00:14:49.530 align:middle line:84%
of a sudden, she
starts to remember

00:14:49.530 --> 00:14:52.020 align:middle line:84%
that there were visitors
that started showing up.

00:14:52.020 --> 00:14:55.050 align:middle line:84%
And she sees these
visitors in these travel

00:14:55.050 --> 00:14:57.240 align:middle line:90%
spheres really, really advanced.

00:14:57.240 --> 00:15:00.600 align:middle line:84%
And these travel spheres
could protect them

00:15:00.600 --> 00:15:03.390 align:middle line:84%
so that you couldn't see
them until they landed.

00:15:03.390 --> 00:15:04.410 align:middle line:90%
And then they came out.

00:15:04.410 --> 00:15:06.900 align:middle line:84%
And they had these
really advanced suits on.

00:15:06.900 --> 00:15:08.640 align:middle line:84%
And the suits looked
like they were

00:15:08.640 --> 00:15:10.440 align:middle line:90%
like regulating their bodies.

00:15:10.440 --> 00:15:12.300 align:middle line:84%
But these were humans
that were coming out

00:15:12.300 --> 00:15:13.770 align:middle line:90%
of these travel spheres.

00:15:13.770 --> 00:15:16.530 align:middle line:84%
And then there was a
whole bunch of commotion

00:15:16.530 --> 00:15:19.410 align:middle line:84%
where these visitors
were wanting something

00:15:19.410 --> 00:15:20.880 align:middle line:90%
from her society.

00:15:20.880 --> 00:15:23.250 align:middle line:84%
And when they
couldn't get it, she

00:15:23.250 --> 00:15:26.040 align:middle line:84%
remembered that they
took her as a prisoner.

00:15:26.040 --> 00:15:31.280 align:middle line:84%
And then they had destroyed
the entire civilization.

00:15:31.280 --> 00:15:34.880 align:middle line:84%
And then as they took
her as a prisoner,

00:15:34.880 --> 00:15:39.990 align:middle line:84%
she realized she spent like
over 60 years in a prison.

00:15:39.990 --> 00:15:43.310 align:middle line:10%
So we came to understand
that these two places were

00:15:43.310 --> 00:15:45.500 align:middle line:10%
Atlantis and Lemuria.

00:15:45.500 --> 00:15:47.960 align:middle line:84%
But they called them
different names.

00:15:47.960 --> 00:15:50.240 align:middle line:84%
In her society,
they called it Aman.

00:15:50.240 --> 00:15:53.840 align:middle line:84%
That was the name of
Lemuria that they went by.

00:15:53.840 --> 00:15:55.560 align:middle line:90%
It's really interesting.

00:15:55.560 --> 00:15:59.670 align:middle line:84%
So after her first session,
I asked her higher self,

00:15:59.670 --> 00:16:02.750 align:middle line:84%
why did you show
her this lifetime?

00:16:02.750 --> 00:16:04.430 align:middle line:84%
Why did you want
her to see this?

00:16:04.430 --> 00:16:06.320 align:middle line:84%
And they said,
because the two of you

00:16:06.320 --> 00:16:09.410 align:middle line:84%
have decided before
you came into this life

00:16:09.410 --> 00:16:12.830 align:middle line:84%
to uncover and share this
information with the world,

00:16:12.830 --> 00:16:15.680 align:middle line:84%
that the world had been waiting
for thousands and thousands

00:16:15.680 --> 00:16:19.100 align:middle line:84%
of years till the
consciousness on the planet

00:16:19.100 --> 00:16:23.170 align:middle line:84%
had evolved enough that you guys
could come back and share this

00:16:23.170 --> 00:16:23.970 align:middle line:90%
again.

00:16:23.970 --> 00:16:26.600 align:middle line:84%
And you wouldn't be
murdered this time for it.

00:16:26.600 --> 00:16:28.970 align:middle line:10%
And people would finally
get this information

00:16:28.970 --> 00:16:32.520 align:middle line:10%
that people had been waiting for
so long for this information.

00:16:32.520 --> 00:16:35.610 align:middle line:84%
And they said, the information
has a consciousness,

00:16:35.610 --> 00:16:37.770 align:middle line:84%
that it's so powerful,
it would even

00:16:37.770 --> 00:16:41.040 align:middle line:84%
create change amongst
the people that heard it.

00:16:41.040 --> 00:16:44.430 align:middle line:84%
So I thought, oh, that's
an interesting story.

00:16:44.430 --> 00:16:45.788 align:middle line:90%
I'm kind of skeptical--

00:16:45.788 --> 00:16:48.330 align:middle line:84%
I don't know if you can tell--
until things are proven to me.

00:16:48.330 --> 00:16:50.850 align:middle line:84%
But then I asked
her higher self,

00:16:50.850 --> 00:16:54.180 align:middle line:84%
what is the very root cause
of her brain condition?

00:16:54.180 --> 00:16:57.420 align:middle line:84%
And they said the root
cause was just the catalyst

00:16:57.420 --> 00:17:00.720 align:middle line:84%
to get her to come see me,
that without a catalyst,

00:17:00.720 --> 00:17:03.030 align:middle line:84%
she would have never
had this session.

00:17:03.030 --> 00:17:04.930 align:middle line:10%
And it's so true.

00:17:04.930 --> 00:17:07.650 align:middle line:84%
So then I said, OK,
well, she came here.

00:17:07.650 --> 00:17:09.833 align:middle line:84%
She did what she
was supposed to do.

00:17:09.833 --> 00:17:11.250 align:middle line:84%
She's having this
session with me.

00:17:11.250 --> 00:17:12.780 align:middle line:90%
Can you release it now?

00:17:12.780 --> 00:17:15.060 align:middle line:90%
And her higher self said, yes.

00:17:15.060 --> 00:17:17.730 align:middle line:10%
And all of a sudden, my
friend felt it draining.

00:17:17.730 --> 00:17:21.150 align:middle line:84%
She could feel it draining
behind her left eye.

00:17:21.150 --> 00:17:23.200 align:middle line:90%
And she came out of the session.

00:17:23.200 --> 00:17:24.630 align:middle line:90%
She was so excited.

00:17:24.630 --> 00:17:28.230 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I wish I could
describe her expression.

00:17:28.230 --> 00:17:30.630 align:middle line:84%
But she could feel
this feeling where

00:17:30.630 --> 00:17:34.650 align:middle line:84%
you know things might
actually turn out OK.

00:17:34.650 --> 00:17:37.980 align:middle line:84%
Because before then, she
had been in so much fear

00:17:37.980 --> 00:17:40.690 align:middle line:84%
about leaving her
little children.

00:17:40.690 --> 00:17:43.290 align:middle line:84%
So she goes back to her
team of specialists.

00:17:43.290 --> 00:17:45.180 align:middle line:90%
And she's healed.

00:17:45.180 --> 00:17:48.090 align:middle line:90%
She was so happy.

00:17:48.090 --> 00:17:49.900 align:middle line:90%
So anyway, we decided--

00:17:49.900 --> 00:17:52.078 align:middle line:90%
[APPLAUSE]

00:17:52.078 --> 00:17:53.100 align:middle line:90%


00:17:53.100 --> 00:17:53.900 align:middle line:90%
I know.

00:17:53.900 --> 00:17:57.680 align:middle line:84%
These miracles happen
in these sessions.

00:17:57.680 --> 00:18:01.940 align:middle line:84%
It's just such a blessing
that Dolores left this for us.

00:18:01.940 --> 00:18:04.040 align:middle line:90%
So she came back.

00:18:04.040 --> 00:18:06.290 align:middle line:84%
And we decided, let's
get together again.

00:18:06.290 --> 00:18:10.220 align:middle line:84%
Let's find out what the story
is that we need to uncover

00:18:10.220 --> 00:18:11.460 align:middle line:90%
and share with the world.

00:18:11.460 --> 00:18:14.870 align:middle line:84%
What has everybody been
waiting for for so long?

00:18:14.870 --> 00:18:18.590 align:middle line:84%
So I asked her higher
consciousness, OK, take us back

00:18:18.590 --> 00:18:21.550 align:middle line:90%
to the beginning of this story.

00:18:21.550 --> 00:18:22.870 align:middle line:10%
And I thought--

00:18:22.870 --> 00:18:24.880 align:middle line:10%
I honestly thought
that we would go back

00:18:24.880 --> 00:18:27.790 align:middle line:10%
to the beginning of that
lifetime in Lemuria,

00:18:27.790 --> 00:18:29.740 align:middle line:10%
that we would start
from the beginning.

00:18:29.740 --> 00:18:31.720 align:middle line:10%
She would uncover her childhood.

00:18:31.720 --> 00:18:33.820 align:middle line:10%
And we would go
through her childhood

00:18:33.820 --> 00:18:36.820 align:middle line:10%
and find out everything
there was to know.

00:18:36.820 --> 00:18:37.720 align:middle line:90%
Lemuria?

00:18:37.720 --> 00:18:39.010 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:18:39.010 --> 00:18:43.360 align:middle line:84%
Her higher consciousness decided
the beginning of the story

00:18:43.360 --> 00:18:48.700 align:middle line:84%
was when she was a commander of
an extraterrestrial ship coming

00:18:48.700 --> 00:18:50.530 align:middle line:90%
to Earth for the first time.

00:18:50.530 --> 00:18:53.830 align:middle line:84%
Now, she did not believe in
extraterrestrials, so I thought,

00:18:53.830 --> 00:18:55.240 align:middle line:90%
oh my God.

00:18:55.240 --> 00:18:57.910 align:middle line:90%
She already thinks I'm so weird.

00:18:57.910 --> 00:19:01.090 align:middle line:84%
This is just not good
for our friendship.

00:19:01.090 --> 00:19:05.260 align:middle line:84%
But here she was
recounting in full detail.

00:19:05.260 --> 00:19:09.130 align:middle line:84%
And it was interesting
because as a practitioner,

00:19:09.130 --> 00:19:13.180 align:middle line:84%
I had already heard a
little of this stuff but not

00:19:13.180 --> 00:19:14.470 align:middle line:90%
these details.

00:19:14.470 --> 00:19:17.890 align:middle line:84%
It was incredibly
detailed to talk--

00:19:17.890 --> 00:19:20.410 align:middle line:84%
to almost like talking
to an extraterrestrial.

00:19:20.410 --> 00:19:23.030 align:middle line:84%
That's what it felt
like because I'm

00:19:23.030 --> 00:19:24.740 align:middle line:84%
going to let you
listen to a little clip

00:19:24.740 --> 00:19:28.520 align:middle line:84%
of this actual second
session we had.

00:19:28.520 --> 00:19:30.440 align:middle line:90%
But this is how it was.

00:19:30.440 --> 00:19:33.420 align:middle line:84%
And you can kind of feel
the energy coming through.

00:19:33.420 --> 00:19:37.460 align:middle line:84%
So she's recounting
this lifetime

00:19:37.460 --> 00:19:41.670 align:middle line:84%
where they were running out of
resources on their home planet.

00:19:41.670 --> 00:19:45.260 align:middle line:84%
And so it appeared that
she came from a star system

00:19:45.260 --> 00:19:48.240 align:middle line:84%
within the Pleiadian
star system.

00:19:48.240 --> 00:19:52.020 align:middle line:10%
And what they did was they
used these type of red crystals

00:19:52.020 --> 00:19:54.870 align:middle line:10%
to create almost
like a new realm,

00:19:54.870 --> 00:19:58.000 align:middle line:10%
a vortex almost, if you
want to call it that.

00:19:58.000 --> 00:20:02.440 align:middle line:84%
And everyone had to go into
this vortex at least once.

00:20:02.440 --> 00:20:06.180 align:middle line:84%
And the reason you had to go in
was because it would shock you

00:20:06.180 --> 00:20:07.530 align:middle line:90%
into enlightenment.

00:20:07.530 --> 00:20:09.990 align:middle line:84%
Once you were shocked
into enlightenment,

00:20:09.990 --> 00:20:14.020 align:middle line:84%
you would understand the
whole nature of reality.

00:20:14.020 --> 00:20:15.990 align:middle line:84%
And then you would
no longer need

00:20:15.990 --> 00:20:19.650 align:middle line:84%
to compete with others because
you would fully understand

00:20:19.650 --> 00:20:21.630 align:middle line:90%
that you were everyone you saw.

00:20:21.630 --> 00:20:24.780 align:middle line:84%
So that's why in
their star system,

00:20:24.780 --> 00:20:27.060 align:middle line:84%
they had to do
this at least once.

00:20:27.060 --> 00:20:31.920 align:middle line:84%
Now, she as a he remembered
he had done it seven times.

00:20:31.920 --> 00:20:33.660 align:middle line:84%
And that was one
of the reasons why

00:20:33.660 --> 00:20:38.970 align:middle line:84%
he was chosen to be a part of
this mission Earth basically.

00:20:38.970 --> 00:20:42.740 align:middle line:84%
When they would go through
this vortex of enlightenment,

00:20:42.740 --> 00:20:45.940 align:middle line:84%
of course, I had her remember
like, go step by step,

00:20:45.940 --> 00:20:48.510 align:middle line:84%
find out the secrets
of the universe.

00:20:48.510 --> 00:20:50.190 align:middle line:90%
I was like, OK, go back.

00:20:50.190 --> 00:20:54.340 align:middle line:84%
And let's find out what's
the secret of the universe.

00:20:54.340 --> 00:20:55.990 align:middle line:90%
So I had to remember.

00:20:55.990 --> 00:20:58.710 align:middle line:84%
And she remembered
going into the vortex

00:20:58.710 --> 00:21:01.440 align:middle line:84%
and then being
like shocked almost

00:21:01.440 --> 00:21:05.160 align:middle line:84%
into this feeling of
like awe and wonder.

00:21:05.160 --> 00:21:08.100 align:middle line:84%
And you would see
that everything

00:21:08.100 --> 00:21:10.380 align:middle line:90%
is in a figure eight form.

00:21:10.380 --> 00:21:13.740 align:middle line:84%
So the nature of reality
is this figure eight.

00:21:13.740 --> 00:21:15.960 align:middle line:90%
So it folds up on top of itself.

00:21:15.960 --> 00:21:18.510 align:middle line:84%
This is what they would
see in the beginning

00:21:18.510 --> 00:21:20.160 align:middle line:90%
as they went into the vortex.

00:21:20.160 --> 00:21:23.790 align:middle line:84%
Then they would see that
the whole reality was

00:21:23.790 --> 00:21:28.290 align:middle line:84%
a game, so to speak,
and that this game never

00:21:28.290 --> 00:21:30.390 align:middle line:90%
ends and never has a beginning.

00:21:30.390 --> 00:21:33.360 align:middle line:84%
But it's been going
on for so long,

00:21:33.360 --> 00:21:38.280 align:middle line:84%
longer than you can comprehend
even in the aspect of time.

00:21:38.280 --> 00:21:41.620 align:middle line:84%
Even this universe
that we're in right

00:21:41.620 --> 00:21:46.570 align:middle line:84%
now used to be a different
universe that was eventually

00:21:46.570 --> 00:21:49.990 align:middle line:84%
played out throughout its
whole life cycle, ended,

00:21:49.990 --> 00:21:51.880 align:middle line:90%
and we're in a new universe.

00:21:51.880 --> 00:21:56.200 align:middle line:84%
I mean, we are all part
of this group, all of us,

00:21:56.200 --> 00:22:00.700 align:middle line:84%
this ancient, ancient group
that has been doing this

00:22:00.700 --> 00:22:06.190 align:middle line:84%
over and over and over again so
that our energy always continues

00:22:06.190 --> 00:22:09.100 align:middle line:84%
to learn, and it
never stays stagnant,

00:22:09.100 --> 00:22:12.730 align:middle line:84%
and that we can always keep
evolving our consciousness,

00:22:12.730 --> 00:22:13.840 align:middle line:90%
our soul.

00:22:13.840 --> 00:22:17.770 align:middle line:84%
So I'm going to let you
listen to a little clip

00:22:17.770 --> 00:22:21.060 align:middle line:84%
of our second session
and what she remembered.

00:22:21.060 --> 00:22:21.860 align:middle line:90%
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:22:21.860 --> 00:22:28.520 align:middle line:84%
- I had an advanced society
for a very long time.

00:22:28.520 --> 00:22:39.545 align:middle line:84%
And the thing that we have
become most reliant on

00:22:39.545 --> 00:22:40.345 align:middle line:90%
is a type--

00:22:40.345 --> 00:22:43.920 align:middle line:90%


00:22:43.920 --> 00:22:47.070 align:middle line:84%
it is like a
mineral or a crystal

00:22:47.070 --> 00:22:50.050 align:middle line:90%
or a combination of both.

00:22:50.050 --> 00:22:55.210 align:middle line:84%
We've just exhausted
our resources of.

00:22:55.210 --> 00:22:59.950 align:middle line:84%
And there's truly no way to
create this in a laboratory.

00:22:59.950 --> 00:23:04.105 align:middle line:90%
It has to be found.

00:23:04.105 --> 00:23:08.150 align:middle line:90%
It has to be found.

00:23:08.150 --> 00:23:13.700 align:middle line:84%
And it could be delivered
to a planet on an asteroid.

00:23:13.700 --> 00:23:16.350 align:middle line:84%
- It can be delivered to
a planet on an asteroid?

00:23:16.350 --> 00:23:20.880 align:middle line:84%
- It can within the
crashing of it into a planet

00:23:20.880 --> 00:23:24.390 align:middle line:84%
or in the formation of
the planets early days

00:23:24.390 --> 00:23:27.870 align:middle line:84%
with many particles
crashing into it.

00:23:27.870 --> 00:23:30.130 align:middle line:90%
It creates them.

00:23:30.130 --> 00:23:37.340 align:middle line:84%
So we have gone to other
places where we have found it

00:23:37.340 --> 00:23:46.360 align:middle line:84%
and have mined those
efficiently over the millennias.

00:23:46.360 --> 00:23:50.240 align:middle line:90%
But this is a new place.

00:23:50.240 --> 00:23:53.645 align:middle line:90%
And it is rich in this resource.

00:23:53.645 --> 00:23:54.595 align:middle line:90%
[END PLAYBACK]

00:23:54.595 --> 00:23:58.280 align:middle line:84%
>> So it's really interesting to
hear my friend that I had known

00:23:58.280 --> 00:24:00.860 align:middle line:84%
for so long, who didn't
believe in extraterrestrials,

00:24:00.860 --> 00:24:03.690 align:middle line:84%
remembering being
an extraterrestrial.

00:24:03.690 --> 00:24:06.020 align:middle line:10%
And it was like, I
could speak directly

00:24:06.020 --> 00:24:11.440 align:middle line:10%
with an extraterrestrial,
so then weird stuff started

00:24:11.440 --> 00:24:15.100 align:middle line:10%
happening in my office since--

00:24:15.100 --> 00:24:21.160 align:middle line:10%
2018 basically is when it
started where people started

00:24:21.160 --> 00:24:23.920 align:middle line:10%
coming in for their
sessions who had never

00:24:23.920 --> 00:24:26.530 align:middle line:10%
met one another
and all of a sudden

00:24:26.530 --> 00:24:29.650 align:middle line:10%
would recount
similar experiences,

00:24:29.650 --> 00:24:33.130 align:middle line:10%
or extraterrestrials would
start using my clients

00:24:33.130 --> 00:24:35.170 align:middle line:10%
as like a radio almost.

00:24:35.170 --> 00:24:37.310 align:middle line:84%
And I thought it was
just a coincidence.

00:24:37.310 --> 00:24:39.310 align:middle line:84%
I thought maybe
this is happening

00:24:39.310 --> 00:24:43.420 align:middle line:84%
to all the other practitioners
because some of my clients

00:24:43.420 --> 00:24:47.770 align:middle line:84%
were also remembering different
lifetimes in Atlantis or Lemuria

00:24:47.770 --> 00:24:50.140 align:middle line:84%
or extraterrestrials
crash-landing.

00:24:50.140 --> 00:24:53.380 align:middle line:84%
And I thought maybe everyone's
experiencing this too,

00:24:53.380 --> 00:24:55.525 align:middle line:90%
so I would ask everybody.

00:24:55.525 --> 00:24:57.850 align:middle line:90%
And it was just me.

00:24:57.850 --> 00:24:59.920 align:middle line:90%
And I thought that's so weird.

00:24:59.920 --> 00:25:03.710 align:middle line:84%
I don't know why, but
it kept happening.

00:25:03.710 --> 00:25:05.350 align:middle line:90%
So here's another clip.

00:25:05.350 --> 00:25:09.680 align:middle line:84%
But this is another clip of
what started happening to me.

00:25:09.680 --> 00:25:14.750 align:middle line:84%
So these extraterrestrials
were using my clients.

00:25:14.750 --> 00:25:21.020 align:middle line:84%
Here's another person just
describing how they look.

00:25:21.020 --> 00:25:22.640 align:middle line:90%
And this is a Pleiadian.

00:25:22.640 --> 00:25:24.020 align:middle line:10%
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:25:24.020 --> 00:25:30.020 align:middle line:10%
- This pants, they
are tight pants.

00:25:30.020 --> 00:25:33.770 align:middle line:10%
I have a belt. And
I have a jacket

00:25:33.770 --> 00:25:41.720 align:middle line:10%
that is tight with a star
on the left chest pocket.

00:25:41.720 --> 00:25:45.590 align:middle line:10%
- Do you get a sense as
to what the star means?

00:25:45.590 --> 00:25:49.340 align:middle line:10%
- It is a symbol for our
intergalactic alliance.

00:25:49.340 --> 00:25:51.220 align:middle line:10%
- Oh, could you
tell me about that?

00:25:51.220 --> 00:25:53.690 align:middle line:10%
- There are many
star systems involved

00:25:53.690 --> 00:25:56.210 align:middle line:10%
in the intergalactic alliance.

00:25:56.210 --> 00:26:00.281 align:middle line:10%
And I cannot speak
to any of them.

00:26:00.281 --> 00:26:03.500 align:middle line:10%
Our piece of the alliance,
the Pleiadian star system,

00:26:03.500 --> 00:26:08.030 align:middle line:10%
represents one of the
points of the star.

00:26:08.030 --> 00:26:11.270 align:middle line:10%
I have a face in a body
and hair and everything

00:26:11.270 --> 00:26:17.270 align:middle line:10%
that appears to be very humanoid
while I'm here on Earth.

00:26:17.270 --> 00:26:18.320 align:middle line:10%
I do not have that.

00:26:18.320 --> 00:26:24.110 align:middle line:10%
I'm a light being when
I am not on Earth.

00:26:24.110 --> 00:26:25.070 align:middle line:10%
- I see.

00:26:25.070 --> 00:26:28.430 align:middle line:10%
So you don't have that body
when you're not on Earth?

00:26:28.430 --> 00:26:31.985 align:middle line:10%
- I only have this body when I
need to come somewhere where--

00:26:31.985 --> 00:26:35.120 align:middle line:10%
in the third density
that requires a body.

00:26:35.120 --> 00:26:38.390 align:middle line:10%
- And how do you
talk through Jasmine?

00:26:38.390 --> 00:26:39.830 align:middle line:10%
- Jasmine is a channel.

00:26:39.830 --> 00:26:40.910 align:middle line:10%
She's a vessel.

00:26:40.910 --> 00:26:45.770 align:middle line:10%
She has allowed me to
come and speak to you

00:26:45.770 --> 00:26:47.340 align:middle line:10%
and answer all of
your questions.

00:26:47.340 --> 00:26:48.140 align:middle line:10%
[END PLAYBACK]

00:26:48.140 --> 00:26:50.780 align:middle line:84%
>> So I noticed they
started coming through.

00:26:50.780 --> 00:26:54.950 align:middle line:84%
And they kept giving me
advice because they wanted

00:26:54.950 --> 00:26:57.600 align:middle line:90%
me to share this information.

00:26:57.600 --> 00:27:01.820 align:middle line:84%
So they kept saying, put
my information in a book.

00:27:01.820 --> 00:27:03.630 align:middle line:90%
And they will share it for me.

00:27:03.630 --> 00:27:07.910 align:middle line:84%
So I put all my information
about Atlantis and Lemuria

00:27:07.910 --> 00:27:09.080 align:middle line:90%
in my first book.

00:27:09.080 --> 00:27:11.060 align:middle line:84%
And they literally
have done all of it.

00:27:11.060 --> 00:27:12.980 align:middle line:90%
I self publish my books.

00:27:12.980 --> 00:27:15.350 align:middle line:84%
And they've just been
sharing it through me.

00:27:15.350 --> 00:27:17.120 align:middle line:84%
There's nothing
special about me.

00:27:17.120 --> 00:27:19.550 align:middle line:84%
I'm literally just
the messenger,

00:27:19.550 --> 00:27:22.460 align:middle line:84%
like just bringing this
information to everyone

00:27:22.460 --> 00:27:24.260 align:middle line:90%
that needs it basically.

00:27:24.260 --> 00:27:26.750 align:middle line:84%
But who are the
extraterrestrials?

00:27:26.750 --> 00:27:29.650 align:middle line:84%
And why do they want
to give us information.

00:27:29.650 --> 00:27:32.390 align:middle line:84%
Well, if you can
see, these people

00:27:32.390 --> 00:27:36.270 align:middle line:84%
are remembering being
an extraterrestrial.

00:27:36.270 --> 00:27:40.400 align:middle line:84%
So how can a person,
so many people

00:27:40.400 --> 00:27:44.840 align:middle line:84%
have these memories if
that doesn't mean that we

00:27:44.840 --> 00:27:46.550 align:middle line:90%
are the extraterrestrials?

00:27:46.550 --> 00:27:50.850 align:middle line:84%
Because so many people
have these memories.

00:27:50.850 --> 00:27:54.120 align:middle line:84%
There's nothing
different between us

00:27:54.120 --> 00:27:55.960 align:middle line:90%
and the extraterrestrials.

00:27:55.960 --> 00:27:59.100 align:middle line:84%
So if you think about
the universe and time,

00:27:59.100 --> 00:28:00.850 align:middle line:90%
time doesn't exist.

00:28:00.850 --> 00:28:03.510 align:middle line:84%
So there is no time in
the rest of the universe.

00:28:03.510 --> 00:28:07.260 align:middle line:84%
And you think about your
past versions of yourself.

00:28:07.260 --> 00:28:09.420 align:middle line:90%
People talk about past lives.

00:28:09.420 --> 00:28:11.790 align:middle line:84%
There's all these things
that happened in the past,

00:28:11.790 --> 00:28:12.660 align:middle line:90%
apparently.

00:28:12.660 --> 00:28:15.250 align:middle line:84%
Well, what about all
the things in our future

00:28:15.250 --> 00:28:17.920 align:middle line:84%
if everything's existing
in this now moment?

00:28:17.920 --> 00:28:22.350 align:middle line:84%
So there are other more
advanced versions of yourself.

00:28:22.350 --> 00:28:27.690 align:middle line:84%
There's other versions of you
that are maybe extraterrestrial

00:28:27.690 --> 00:28:30.090 align:middle line:84%
or even parallel
lives that you might

00:28:30.090 --> 00:28:33.390 align:middle line:84%
be experiencing on other
realms or other planets.

00:28:33.390 --> 00:28:36.840 align:middle line:90%
We're so multidimensional.

00:28:36.840 --> 00:28:39.180 align:middle line:10%
Now, I really want to
talk about the Greys

00:28:39.180 --> 00:28:42.720 align:middle line:10%
a little bit because
it's interesting to me

00:28:42.720 --> 00:28:45.180 align:middle line:10%
because so many people
are afraid of them.

00:28:45.180 --> 00:28:49.020 align:middle line:84%
But they started coming through
my clients like around--

00:28:49.020 --> 00:28:52.230 align:middle line:84%
they started happening
more around 2019,

00:28:52.230 --> 00:28:55.230 align:middle line:84%
where they would use my
clients as this radio.

00:28:55.230 --> 00:28:58.080 align:middle line:84%
And they started sharing
things like they're here.

00:28:58.080 --> 00:29:01.030 align:middle line:90%


00:29:01.030 --> 00:29:01.830 align:middle line:90%
Help us.

00:29:01.830 --> 00:29:05.230 align:middle line:84%
And we're there
also to help them.

00:29:05.230 --> 00:29:06.780 align:middle line:90%
We're doing this together.

00:29:06.780 --> 00:29:11.460 align:middle line:84%
I never found any
fearful, that they

00:29:11.460 --> 00:29:13.930 align:middle line:84%
were trying to take our
souls or anything like that.

00:29:13.930 --> 00:29:16.510 align:middle line:84%
I never found any of that
to be true whatsoever.

00:29:16.510 --> 00:29:22.440 align:middle line:84%
So I want to share a
little clip of a client

00:29:22.440 --> 00:29:25.920 align:middle line:84%
that actually remembers being
a Grey extraterrestrial,

00:29:25.920 --> 00:29:28.470 align:middle line:84%
and then just more
about their lives,

00:29:28.470 --> 00:29:30.900 align:middle line:84%
what is it like to be a
Grey extraterrestrial.

00:29:30.900 --> 00:29:32.940 align:middle line:84%
Well, you can actually
hear it for yourself

00:29:32.940 --> 00:29:36.960 align:middle line:84%
I really don't think that you
could possibly find something

00:29:36.960 --> 00:29:38.490 align:middle line:90%
like this anywhere.

00:29:38.490 --> 00:29:40.770 align:middle line:84%
So I'm going to let you
hear what it actually

00:29:40.770 --> 00:29:43.600 align:middle line:84%
sounds like when you're
talking to somebody that's

00:29:43.600 --> 00:29:45.847 align:middle line:90%
remembering this kind of stuff.

00:29:45.847 --> 00:29:46.681 align:middle line:90%
[AUDIO PLAYBACK]

00:29:46.681 --> 00:29:48.570 align:middle line:90%
- What do you look like there?

00:29:48.570 --> 00:29:51.700 align:middle line:84%
If you look down, can
you see feet there?

00:29:51.700 --> 00:29:53.210 align:middle line:10%
- Kind of, yeah.

00:29:53.210 --> 00:29:54.350 align:middle line:10%
Kind of make them out.

00:29:54.350 --> 00:29:58.200 align:middle line:10%
They're like nubby feet.

00:29:58.200 --> 00:30:01.210 align:middle line:10%
I feel like I have three
toes there that I can see.

00:30:01.210 --> 00:30:03.030 align:middle line:10%
I don't know if we
would call them toes.

00:30:03.030 --> 00:30:04.420 align:middle line:10%
I'm not sure.

00:30:04.420 --> 00:30:05.220 align:middle line:10%
They're short.

00:30:05.220 --> 00:30:08.040 align:middle line:10%
They don't look like they
have a lot of joints in them.

00:30:08.040 --> 00:30:09.540 align:middle line:10%
There's not a lot of movement.

00:30:09.540 --> 00:30:10.860 align:middle line:10%
- Do they have a color?

00:30:10.860 --> 00:30:13.640 align:middle line:10%


00:30:13.640 --> 00:30:20.300 align:middle line:10%
- Pale, brownish,
grayish, a color

00:30:20.300 --> 00:30:22.280 align:middle line:10%
that's not a very
appealing color.

00:30:22.280 --> 00:30:26.180 align:middle line:10%
- What about if you
look up your body?

00:30:26.180 --> 00:30:28.450 align:middle line:10%
What do you look like?

00:30:28.450 --> 00:30:34.130 align:middle line:84%
- It's pretty standard gray
like little skinny body.

00:30:34.130 --> 00:30:35.840 align:middle line:90%
I can tell that my head is big.

00:30:35.840 --> 00:30:38.400 align:middle line:90%


00:30:38.400 --> 00:30:41.576 align:middle line:90%
Feel its presence, you know?

00:30:41.576 --> 00:30:44.520 align:middle line:84%
- And what do you
notice inside this body?

00:30:44.520 --> 00:30:45.320 align:middle line:90%
How do you feel?

00:30:45.320 --> 00:30:47.750 align:middle line:90%
Do you feel healthy or not?

00:30:47.750 --> 00:30:51.200 align:middle line:90%
- I feel healthy.

00:30:51.200 --> 00:30:54.920 align:middle line:84%
But the body is
like registering--

00:30:54.920 --> 00:30:59.570 align:middle line:84%
reading information
from the environment.

00:30:59.570 --> 00:31:02.090 align:middle line:90%
That's what a human body does.

00:31:02.090 --> 00:31:04.040 align:middle line:90%
But it's not like that.

00:31:04.040 --> 00:31:11.380 align:middle line:10%
I can tell that it's separate
from me, even though I'm in it.

00:31:11.380 --> 00:31:13.120 align:middle line:10%
So I can tell it's functioning.

00:31:13.120 --> 00:31:15.690 align:middle line:10%
So it's functioning fine.

00:31:15.690 --> 00:31:18.020 align:middle line:10%
Yeah, the Avatar suit, yeah.

00:31:18.020 --> 00:31:19.470 align:middle line:10%
There's no real sleeping.

00:31:19.470 --> 00:31:20.835 align:middle line:90%
- There's no sleeping?

00:31:20.835 --> 00:31:23.430 align:middle line:90%
- No.

00:31:23.430 --> 00:31:27.955 align:middle line:84%
Why would the body need to rest
if it's not actually a body?

00:31:27.955 --> 00:31:29.770 align:middle line:90%
- I see.

00:31:29.770 --> 00:31:31.880 align:middle line:90%
How do you feel in this place?

00:31:31.880 --> 00:31:34.280 align:middle line:84%
Do you have any
emotions or feelings?

00:31:34.280 --> 00:31:36.100 align:middle line:90%
- Subtle.

00:31:36.100 --> 00:31:40.420 align:middle line:84%
That's why it's hard to
describe how you feel.

00:31:40.420 --> 00:31:43.510 align:middle line:90%
Just going with the flow.

00:31:43.510 --> 00:31:46.750 align:middle line:84%
It's interesting to see
the things that I do.

00:31:46.750 --> 00:31:53.020 align:middle line:84%
But it's very
redundant, repetitive.

00:31:53.020 --> 00:31:57.290 align:middle line:10%
- What kind of things do
you find interesting there?

00:31:57.290 --> 00:32:00.890 align:middle line:10%
- Just the technology.

00:32:00.890 --> 00:32:05.420 align:middle line:84%
The technology is high
tech, low tech sometimes.

00:32:05.420 --> 00:32:09.320 align:middle line:84%
So when I look at it, it
looks like a kid made it.

00:32:09.320 --> 00:32:14.030 align:middle line:90%


00:32:14.030 --> 00:32:16.480 align:middle line:90%
It's so simple.

00:32:16.480 --> 00:32:21.830 align:middle line:84%
But because it uses advanced
knowledge of things,

00:32:21.830 --> 00:32:25.390 align:middle line:84%
so you won't have an excessive
amount of wires or chips

00:32:25.390 --> 00:32:28.590 align:middle line:90%
in this stuff.

00:32:28.590 --> 00:32:34.790 align:middle line:84%
You can just see like a stone
and some wires coming off of it.

00:32:34.790 --> 00:32:36.097 align:middle line:90%
It's just minimal.

00:32:36.097 --> 00:32:38.180 align:middle line:84%
It's not like when you
open the dash of like a car

00:32:38.180 --> 00:32:41.570 align:middle line:84%
that we drive and there's
thousands of wires everywhere.

00:32:41.570 --> 00:32:42.925 align:middle line:90%
It's not like that.

00:32:42.925 --> 00:32:45.680 align:middle line:84%
- And do you get--
how is it powered?

00:32:45.680 --> 00:32:48.395 align:middle line:90%
- It's powered from the air.

00:32:48.395 --> 00:32:49.625 align:middle line:10%
The energy in the air.

00:32:49.625 --> 00:32:52.630 align:middle line:10%
- Where does this
energy come from?

00:32:52.630 --> 00:32:54.170 align:middle line:10%
- It just exists everywhere.

00:32:54.170 --> 00:32:56.120 align:middle line:10%
It's the stuff that
reality is made of.

00:32:56.120 --> 00:33:02.260 align:middle line:84%
So it's like a phantom power
where just touching something,

00:33:02.260 --> 00:33:04.510 align:middle line:84%
well, you'll be the final
conduit between the air

00:33:04.510 --> 00:33:08.480 align:middle line:84%
and the technology
to turn it on.

00:33:08.480 --> 00:33:13.220 align:middle line:84%
So any technology doesn't
necessarily have to be--

00:33:13.220 --> 00:33:16.190 align:middle line:84%
like have a battery
or anything like that.

00:33:16.190 --> 00:33:19.830 align:middle line:90%


00:33:19.830 --> 00:33:21.557 align:middle line:84%
I have to give you a
real-world example.

00:33:21.557 --> 00:33:23.140 align:middle line:84%
It's the only way I
can describe this.

00:33:23.140 --> 00:33:27.690 align:middle line:90%
So if your phone and this--

00:33:27.690 --> 00:33:29.490 align:middle line:90%
you just pick your phone up.

00:33:29.490 --> 00:33:32.250 align:middle line:84%
Like now, you just connected
the air to your phone.

00:33:32.250 --> 00:33:33.570 align:middle line:90%
You're the conduit.

00:33:33.570 --> 00:33:35.110 align:middle line:90%
The phone doesn't do anything.

00:33:35.110 --> 00:33:38.820 align:middle line:84%
But when you look at the screen,
you can see your phone lit up.

00:33:38.820 --> 00:33:41.540 align:middle line:84%
And you can see
everything somebody else

00:33:41.540 --> 00:33:45.170 align:middle line:90%
wouldn't be able to see it.

00:33:45.170 --> 00:33:47.270 align:middle line:90%
That kind of stuff.

00:33:47.270 --> 00:33:49.730 align:middle line:84%
When you let go of it,
it's not on anymore.

00:33:49.730 --> 00:33:52.940 align:middle line:90%
It doesn't look on.

00:33:52.940 --> 00:33:54.870 align:middle line:84%
And you just use your
mind to communicate

00:33:54.870 --> 00:34:01.110 align:middle line:84%
with it because it's just
reflecting your information.

00:34:01.110 --> 00:34:02.925 align:middle line:84%
It goes like that
for the ships too.

00:34:02.925 --> 00:34:05.730 align:middle line:84%
They guide the ships
with their mind.

00:34:05.730 --> 00:34:08.429 align:middle line:10%
But they'll put their hands
in these little things

00:34:08.429 --> 00:34:09.870 align:middle line:10%
to complete the circuit.

00:34:09.870 --> 00:34:13.889 align:middle line:10%
- What do the little things look
like that complete the circuit?

00:34:13.889 --> 00:34:17.130 align:middle line:10%
- Simple hand prints.

00:34:17.130 --> 00:34:19.530 align:middle line:10%
And the material,
they're not that fancy.

00:34:19.530 --> 00:34:22.980 align:middle line:10%
That's why I was saying it
doesn't look that fancy.

00:34:22.980 --> 00:34:24.549 align:middle line:10%
It just is fancy, you know?

00:34:24.549 --> 00:34:25.349 align:middle line:10%
- Uh-huh.

00:34:25.349 --> 00:34:29.400 align:middle line:10%
And when they put their hands
in the circuit, what happens?

00:34:29.400 --> 00:34:30.690 align:middle line:10%
It complete a circuit.

00:34:30.690 --> 00:34:33.439 align:middle line:10%
What do you mean by that?

00:34:33.439 --> 00:34:38.130 align:middle line:84%
- So with the consciousness
inside of the little body,

00:34:38.130 --> 00:34:39.570 align:middle line:90%
you have your feet grounding.

00:34:39.570 --> 00:34:42.150 align:middle line:90%
Your hands are the opposite end.

00:34:42.150 --> 00:34:44.010 align:middle line:90%
It's just like a circle.

00:34:44.010 --> 00:34:49.047 align:middle line:84%
- Can you tell me more about
what it looks like on the ship?

00:34:49.047 --> 00:34:50.620 align:middle line:90%
- It's very smooth inside.

00:34:50.620 --> 00:34:52.600 align:middle line:84%
There's no corners
in these ships.

00:34:52.600 --> 00:34:56.530 align:middle line:90%
There are no edges.

00:34:56.530 --> 00:34:57.760 align:middle line:90%
It's like molded.

00:34:57.760 --> 00:35:01.030 align:middle line:90%
The seats are molded.

00:35:01.030 --> 00:35:04.690 align:middle line:84%
They're not like a chair
that spins on top or anything

00:35:04.690 --> 00:35:05.810 align:middle line:90%
like that.

00:35:05.810 --> 00:35:09.010 align:middle line:84%
It's just a lump in
the vehicle itself

00:35:09.010 --> 00:35:13.240 align:middle line:84%
that comes up like someone just
took some clay and pulled it.

00:35:13.240 --> 00:35:16.000 align:middle line:84%
And it stretched into a
little thing you could sit on.

00:35:16.000 --> 00:35:18.530 align:middle line:90%


00:35:18.530 --> 00:35:23.185 align:middle line:84%
- What does a
material look like?

00:35:23.185 --> 00:35:28.480 align:middle line:10%
- Almost like, I don't
know, inside of a clay place

00:35:28.480 --> 00:35:30.430 align:middle line:10%
that you would make
but incredibly smooth.

00:35:30.430 --> 00:35:35.790 align:middle line:10%
It's just got this durable
yet soft look to it.

00:35:35.790 --> 00:35:38.190 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't look like smooth
and hard like granite.

00:35:38.190 --> 00:35:45.230 align:middle line:84%
It looks smooth and hard
like a soapstone or like a--

00:35:45.230 --> 00:35:46.880 align:middle line:84%
I'm not sure how
to describe this.

00:35:46.880 --> 00:35:50.870 align:middle line:84%
But it also looks like
it's covered in crystals.

00:35:50.870 --> 00:35:52.505 align:middle line:90%
- What kind of crystals?

00:35:52.505 --> 00:35:55.790 align:middle line:90%


00:35:55.790 --> 00:35:58.120 align:middle line:90%
- I'm not sure what kind.

00:35:58.120 --> 00:36:01.030 align:middle line:84%
But they just look like
clear white crystals,

00:36:01.030 --> 00:36:02.740 align:middle line:90%
like tiny little pieces.

00:36:02.740 --> 00:36:04.405 align:middle line:84%
So it looks like
the walls sparkle.

00:36:04.405 --> 00:36:08.855 align:middle line:84%
- What do you do during
your day-to-day life?

00:36:08.855 --> 00:36:11.010 align:middle line:90%
- I'm almost like an apprentice.

00:36:11.010 --> 00:36:14.280 align:middle line:90%


00:36:14.280 --> 00:36:15.180 align:middle line:90%
I go with the crew.

00:36:15.180 --> 00:36:18.340 align:middle line:84%
And I just assist
the tall Greys.

00:36:18.340 --> 00:36:23.530 align:middle line:84%
We can shift into
the astral realm.

00:36:23.530 --> 00:36:26.140 align:middle line:84%
And it's like a conscious
thing that can be done.

00:36:26.140 --> 00:36:28.390 align:middle line:84%
And there's also a
technological version of it too.

00:36:28.390 --> 00:36:33.290 align:middle line:84%
So if you're doing
some intense stuff

00:36:33.290 --> 00:36:36.437 align:middle line:84%
and your focus is constantly
going in different places,

00:36:36.437 --> 00:36:38.270 align:middle line:84%
you can have a technology
that will keep you

00:36:38.270 --> 00:36:40.260 align:middle line:90%
in one dimension or the other.

00:36:40.260 --> 00:36:42.710 align:middle line:90%
I as a Grey enjoy the humans.

00:36:42.710 --> 00:36:46.010 align:middle line:84%
I'm pretty sure it's just about
the humans are the fun thing.

00:36:46.010 --> 00:36:47.090 align:middle line:90%
We watch them.

00:36:47.090 --> 00:36:49.850 align:middle line:90%
We live through them.

00:36:49.850 --> 00:36:53.600 align:middle line:84%
There's not a whole lot of
emotion in the Grey society.

00:36:53.600 --> 00:36:57.230 align:middle line:84%
Every Grey here has like a
personality type a little bit.

00:36:57.230 --> 00:37:00.290 align:middle line:84%
you can still tell when you
interact with them that they're

00:37:00.290 --> 00:37:02.540 align:middle line:90%
different than another one.

00:37:02.540 --> 00:37:06.230 align:middle line:84%
But some might have
more emotion than others

00:37:06.230 --> 00:37:08.310 align:middle line:84%
when you meet the
Greys and stuff.

00:37:08.310 --> 00:37:10.020 align:middle line:84%
But other than dealing
with the humans,

00:37:10.020 --> 00:37:12.270 align:middle line:84%
there's not a whole lot of
what people would call fun.

00:37:12.270 --> 00:37:13.400 align:middle line:90%
It's all work.

00:37:13.400 --> 00:37:15.896 align:middle line:84%
- Does your group
have an agenda?

00:37:15.896 --> 00:37:18.950 align:middle line:84%
- Just a mutually beneficial
thing that's trying to happen,

00:37:18.950 --> 00:37:23.270 align:middle line:84%
that we the Greys are
trying to do with humanity.

00:37:23.270 --> 00:37:24.300 align:middle line:90%
- Do you have any--

00:37:24.300 --> 00:37:25.100 align:middle line:90%
go ahead.

00:37:25.100 --> 00:37:26.720 align:middle line:90%
- It seems selfish and scary.

00:37:26.720 --> 00:37:30.230 align:middle line:10%
But it's actually beneficial
for everyone involved,

00:37:30.230 --> 00:37:31.820 align:middle line:10%
or we wouldn't be doing it.

00:37:31.820 --> 00:37:36.470 align:middle line:10%
- Do you have any advice for us
as we go through this ascension

00:37:36.470 --> 00:37:37.280 align:middle line:10%
process?

00:37:37.280 --> 00:37:38.210 align:middle line:10%
Is there any advice?

00:37:38.210 --> 00:37:39.920 align:middle line:10%
Because it's so chaotic.

00:37:39.920 --> 00:37:45.440 align:middle line:10%
- Enjoy all the emotions
involved because not many--

00:37:45.440 --> 00:37:50.160 align:middle line:10%
not everybody has the ability
to even feel the emotions,

00:37:50.160 --> 00:37:51.910 align:middle line:10%
whether they're good or bad.

00:37:51.910 --> 00:37:55.690 align:middle line:84%
Just being grateful
for being alive,

00:37:55.690 --> 00:37:57.640 align:middle line:84%
not only does it help
your ascension process,

00:37:57.640 --> 00:38:01.720 align:middle line:84%
but the best advice is
just to enjoy everything,

00:38:01.720 --> 00:38:05.770 align:middle line:84%
actually enjoy what you see when
you walk-- when you look around.

00:38:05.770 --> 00:38:08.890 align:middle line:84%
You have an ability to take
something that means nothing

00:38:08.890 --> 00:38:14.340 align:middle line:84%
and make it something beautiful
just by the way you perceive it.

00:38:14.340 --> 00:38:18.020 align:middle line:84%
And those emotions are really
what help you ascend upwards.

00:38:18.020 --> 00:38:18.820 align:middle line:90%
[END PLAYBACK]

00:38:18.820 --> 00:38:23.250 align:middle line:84%
>> So it was interesting because
as these extraterrestrials kept

00:38:23.250 --> 00:38:25.590 align:middle line:84%
coming through or people
would remember being

00:38:25.590 --> 00:38:28.290 align:middle line:84%
an extraterrestrial
in so many details,

00:38:28.290 --> 00:38:32.370 align:middle line:84%
they kept bringing up how
powerful we are all the time.

00:38:32.370 --> 00:38:36.510 align:middle line:84%
They just said that we are all
masters of this limitation,

00:38:36.510 --> 00:38:39.900 align:middle line:84%
that we totally have
forgotten how powerful we are.

00:38:39.900 --> 00:38:44.880 align:middle line:84%
But they kept saying that
the most powerful being

00:38:44.880 --> 00:38:48.060 align:middle line:90%
in the universe is the human.

00:38:48.060 --> 00:38:50.220 align:middle line:90%
Who knew?

00:38:50.220 --> 00:38:53.130 align:middle line:84%
And I was like, wait a
minute, I don't believe you.

00:38:53.130 --> 00:38:55.590 align:middle line:84%
And they said,
yes, because humans

00:38:55.590 --> 00:38:59.640 align:middle line:84%
are known throughout the
universe to be the most powerful

00:38:59.640 --> 00:39:03.450 align:middle line:84%
in a sense because other
beings throughout the universe

00:39:03.450 --> 00:39:07.950 align:middle line:84%
have more limitations
than a human does.

00:39:07.950 --> 00:39:12.760 align:middle line:84%
Actually, a human has
unlimited potential.

00:39:12.760 --> 00:39:19.590 align:middle line:84%
And this is known throughout the
whole universe, except for us.

00:39:19.590 --> 00:39:22.470 align:middle line:84%
We're like the
last ones to know.

00:39:22.470 --> 00:39:27.280 align:middle line:84%
But the higher consciousness
and all these extraterrestrials

00:39:27.280 --> 00:39:32.070 align:middle line:84%
keep saying that you come
here to totally forget

00:39:32.070 --> 00:39:33.630 align:middle line:90%
how powerful you are.

00:39:33.630 --> 00:39:36.000 align:middle line:90%
And you want to remember.

00:39:36.000 --> 00:39:38.910 align:middle line:84%
You want to release
these patterns,

00:39:38.910 --> 00:39:42.120 align:middle line:84%
release these old
programs and thoughts,

00:39:42.120 --> 00:39:45.570 align:middle line:84%
and then learn about
yourself again.

00:39:45.570 --> 00:39:51.060 align:middle line:84%
And the superhumans are
the fully awakened human,

00:39:51.060 --> 00:39:53.700 align:middle line:90%
like Shiva or Buddha.

00:39:53.700 --> 00:39:57.250 align:middle line:90%
And that is who we really are.

00:39:57.250 --> 00:40:00.870 align:middle line:84%
That is the trajectory
of humanity actually.

00:40:00.870 --> 00:40:04.620 align:middle line:84%
We are going back
up into this time

00:40:04.620 --> 00:40:09.870 align:middle line:84%
where we will start to awaken
our true divinity actually.
