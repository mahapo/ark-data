00:00:04.850 --> 00:00:08.245 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:08.245 --> 00:00:11.640 align:middle line:90%


00:00:11.640 --> 00:00:14.950 align:middle line:10%
>> So this is the remote
view that changed my life.

00:00:14.950 --> 00:00:16.840 align:middle line:10%
This is called an outbounder.

00:00:16.840 --> 00:00:18.900 align:middle line:10%
Here's the setup,
how this works.

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:22.240 align:middle line:10%
So you're in a class.

00:00:22.240 --> 00:00:24.980 align:middle line:10%
You just have nothing but a
desk and a piece of paper.

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:29.560 align:middle line:10%
There's an instructor, and
he has arranged with someone

00:00:29.560 --> 00:00:33.650 align:middle line:10%
to be placed somewhere in
the world at a certain time.

00:00:33.650 --> 00:00:34.760 align:middle line:90%
Let's just say noon.

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:40.030 align:middle line:10%
And your mission is to try
to perceive their environment

00:00:40.030 --> 00:00:43.280 align:middle line:10%
and to try to perceive if
they are male or female.

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:44.080 align:middle line:10%
OK?

00:00:44.080 --> 00:00:47.060 align:middle line:10%
So all you're going to
do is quiet your mind.

00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:51.130 align:middle line:84%
You go through the protocols,
which I'm not going through.

00:00:51.130 --> 00:00:54.310 align:middle line:84%
Write down your target
number, quiet down,

00:00:54.310 --> 00:00:56.750 align:middle line:84%
and you just go
through the process.

00:00:56.750 --> 00:00:58.370 align:middle line:90%
You let things emerge.

00:00:58.370 --> 00:00:59.800 align:middle line:84%
And if they don't
begin to emerge,

00:00:59.800 --> 00:01:01.780 align:middle line:84%
you begin to probe
with the questions

00:01:01.780 --> 00:01:03.469 align:middle line:90%
that you are trained to do.

00:01:03.469 --> 00:01:04.269 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:01:04.269 --> 00:01:07.820 align:middle line:90%
So when I did this.

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:09.600 align:middle line:90%
I went into darkness.

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:10.550 align:middle line:10%
Nothing.

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:14.090 align:middle line:10%
And all of a sudden, I start
to feel this wispy water

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:15.830 align:middle line:10%
on my face.

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:18.390 align:middle line:10%
It was like water
molecules in the air.

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:21.650 align:middle line:84%
And I start to see
this shadowy shape.

00:01:21.650 --> 00:01:23.990 align:middle line:84%
That's one thing I didn't
say about remote viewing.

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:26.250 align:middle line:84%
It's rarely like
a clear picture.

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:29.528 align:middle line:84%
It's very fragmented
and shadowy,

00:01:29.528 --> 00:01:31.320 align:middle line:84%
and you're trying to
bring it into clarity.

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:35.280 align:middle line:10%
But I'm seeing this sort of
shadowy shape and this turtle

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:36.080 align:middle line:10%
shape.

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:40.430 align:middle line:10%
And then I'm smelling
duck excrement,

00:01:40.430 --> 00:01:42.680 align:middle line:10%
and I'm smelling water.

00:01:42.680 --> 00:01:44.970 align:middle line:10%
I can smell the fishy smell.

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:48.720 align:middle line:10%
I can smell the concrete
that's got moss on it.

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:51.750 align:middle line:10%
And I can tell that this
is a big body of water.

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:55.040 align:middle line:90%
It's not a beach.

00:01:55.040 --> 00:01:57.230 align:middle line:84%
I can smell it's
enclosed, and it's

00:01:57.230 --> 00:01:59.510 align:middle line:90%
been like that for a long time.

00:01:59.510 --> 00:02:00.450 align:middle line:90%
It was dank.

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:01.670 align:middle line:90%
That's my word for it.

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:05.570 align:middle line:10%
It was really kind
of yucky, but there

00:02:05.570 --> 00:02:09.330 align:middle line:10%
was a beautiful feeling of
all of the animals, just

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:11.400 align:middle line:10%
little animals.

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:15.180 align:middle line:10%
And I could feel that there
were these structures, big body

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:17.200 align:middle line:10%
of water with these structures.

00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:19.780 align:middle line:10%
So I had this really
high level of engagement.

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:21.300 align:middle line:10%
And then when I
thought it was over,

00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:25.290 align:middle line:10%
then I see this reflective
surface, probably

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:29.170 align:middle line:10%
one of the clearest things I've
ever seen in my remote views.

00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:32.370 align:middle line:10%
And I see an eye
looking back at me.

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:34.050 align:middle line:90%
And it was a woman's eye.

00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:36.900 align:middle line:90%
And I knew this is a woman.

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:39.010 align:middle line:90%
And they called it.

00:02:39.010 --> 00:02:40.320 align:middle line:90%
It was over.

00:02:40.320 --> 00:02:41.555 align:middle line:90%
Then here's the reveal.

00:02:41.555 --> 00:02:42.000 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:43.833 align:middle line:84%
I'm not going to explain
every little thing.

00:02:43.833 --> 00:02:47.230 align:middle line:84%
So AV, though, is
advanced visuals.

00:02:47.230 --> 00:02:51.060 align:middle line:84%
So if your brain
is guessing early,

00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:54.270 align:middle line:84%
before you write down the
target, you want to capture it.

00:02:54.270 --> 00:02:57.100 align:middle line:84%
This system is designed
to capture everything,

00:02:57.100 --> 00:02:58.540 align:middle line:90%
and that's one of the things.

00:02:58.540 --> 00:03:01.230 align:middle line:84%
And for me, my brain
just starts going,

00:03:01.230 --> 00:03:02.800 align:middle line:84%
and I need to capture
those visuals.

00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:04.500 align:middle line:90%
So just remember that grill.

00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:08.430 align:middle line:10%
AOL just means your left
brain is guessing and naming,

00:03:08.430 --> 00:03:09.850 align:middle line:10%
and it's not
supposed to do that.

00:03:09.850 --> 00:03:13.310 align:middle line:10%
So you label it, almost like
you're saying, OK, left brain,

00:03:13.310 --> 00:03:14.110 align:middle line:10%
I hear you.

00:03:14.110 --> 00:03:15.580 align:middle line:84%
I'm just to put
that to the side.

00:03:15.580 --> 00:03:17.070 align:middle line:84%
That's what AOL
means, and you're

00:03:17.070 --> 00:03:18.990 align:middle line:90%
going to see it all over this.

00:03:18.990 --> 00:03:19.830 align:middle line:90%
There's this.

00:03:19.830 --> 00:03:21.780 align:middle line:84%
This is what it looks
like, the drawing.

00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:23.230 align:middle line:90%
Body of water.

00:03:23.230 --> 00:03:25.140 align:middle line:84%
I could definitely
tell it was water

00:03:25.140 --> 00:03:27.810 align:middle line:84%
and that it was like a fountain,
but I would not name that.

00:03:27.810 --> 00:03:29.100 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:03:29.100 --> 00:03:31.420 align:middle line:90%
The turtle shape, marine life.

00:03:31.420 --> 00:03:34.020 align:middle line:84%
This is me trying to draw
the reflective surface where

00:03:34.020 --> 00:03:36.850 align:middle line:90%
I'm seeing the eye.

00:03:36.850 --> 00:03:37.650 align:middle line:90%
Let's see.

00:03:37.650 --> 00:03:38.320 align:middle line:10%
Where are we?

00:03:38.320 --> 00:03:40.930 align:middle line:10%
This is kind of what it looks
like where I'm probing myself.

00:03:40.930 --> 00:03:42.670 align:middle line:10%
It's land and water.

00:03:42.670 --> 00:03:43.750 align:middle line:10%
What are the colors?

00:03:43.750 --> 00:03:45.160 align:middle line:10%
It's bluish and clear.

00:03:45.160 --> 00:03:46.150 align:middle line:10%
What are the textures?

00:03:46.150 --> 00:03:47.410 align:middle line:10%
What does it feel like?

00:03:47.410 --> 00:03:50.880 align:middle line:84%
And I was saying it felt
like stillness on the inside,

00:03:50.880 --> 00:03:53.410 align:middle line:84%
but all this little
movement on the outside.

00:03:53.410 --> 00:03:55.380 align:middle line:90%
So here's the reveal.

00:03:55.380 --> 00:03:58.720 align:middle line:10%
It was Lake Eola in
Orlando, Florida.

00:03:58.720 --> 00:04:00.870 align:middle line:10%
The person who was
there, her name

00:04:00.870 --> 00:04:03.180 align:middle line:10%
was Patricia Cyrus,
who happens to be

00:04:03.180 --> 00:04:05.380 align:middle line:10%
an incredible remote viewer.

00:04:05.380 --> 00:04:08.130 align:middle line:84%
And I'm just going
to show you really

00:04:08.130 --> 00:04:09.460 align:middle line:90%
quickly what it looks like.

00:04:09.460 --> 00:04:12.600 align:middle line:10%
So there's the grill.

00:04:12.600 --> 00:04:13.857 align:middle line:10%
So it was a fountain.

00:04:13.857 --> 00:04:15.690 align:middle line:10%
This is just to show
you what it looks like,

00:04:15.690 --> 00:04:17.829 align:middle line:10%
what it looks like,
what it looks like.

00:04:17.829 --> 00:04:19.060 align:middle line:90%
So here it is.

00:04:19.060 --> 00:04:20.350 align:middle line:90%
Here's the comparison.

00:04:20.350 --> 00:04:24.300 align:middle line:84%
So this is what it looks
like, if you've never seen it.

00:04:24.300 --> 00:04:26.140 align:middle line:90%
We have our own drawings.

00:04:26.140 --> 00:04:28.530 align:middle line:84%
And then we see what our
brain was able to perceive

00:04:28.530 --> 00:04:30.330 align:middle line:84%
and what it wasn't
able to perceive.

00:04:30.330 --> 00:04:33.540 align:middle line:10%
But what was so--
oh, I'll get into it.

00:04:33.540 --> 00:04:36.100 align:middle line:10%
See, there's the turtle
shape, marine life.

00:04:36.100 --> 00:04:39.040 align:middle line:84%
Now, this is the
most important part.

00:04:39.040 --> 00:04:43.430 align:middle line:84%
Years later, I happened
to move to Orlando.

00:04:43.430 --> 00:04:44.230 align:middle line:90%
I was a Canadian.

00:04:44.230 --> 00:04:45.648 align:middle line:90%
I was doing this in Vancouver.

00:04:45.648 --> 00:04:48.190 align:middle line:84%
I never knew that I was going
to end up living in the States.

00:04:48.190 --> 00:04:51.280 align:middle line:84%
I get transferred there through
a weird chain of events.

00:04:51.280 --> 00:04:54.270 align:middle line:84%
I meet this woman,
and I was so excited.

00:04:54.270 --> 00:04:59.020 align:middle line:10%
Because I didn't really care
about the remote viewing per se.

00:04:59.020 --> 00:05:00.643 align:middle line:10%
I wanted to know about the mind.

00:05:00.643 --> 00:05:01.560 align:middle line:10%
I always want to know.

00:05:01.560 --> 00:05:03.930 align:middle line:10%
What else happened
that she didn't say?

00:05:03.930 --> 00:05:08.190 align:middle line:10%
Because I felt so engaged
in the environment.

00:05:08.190 --> 00:05:11.350 align:middle line:10%
So she looked at it, and
she said, oh, my god.

00:05:11.350 --> 00:05:15.300 align:middle line:10%
When I was sitting there,
I opened up my purse,

00:05:15.300 --> 00:05:18.190 align:middle line:10%
and I pulled out
a compact mirror.

00:05:18.190 --> 00:05:21.580 align:middle line:10%
And I looked at myself to
see if it helped anybody.

00:05:21.580 --> 00:05:25.030 align:middle line:84%
And I thought, are
you kidding me?

00:05:25.030 --> 00:05:26.800 align:middle line:90%
Because nobody mentioned this.

00:05:26.800 --> 00:05:29.520 align:middle line:84%
And so you can just
go, wow, but it's

00:05:29.520 --> 00:05:33.360 align:middle line:84%
like, OK, what are the
implications of this

00:05:33.360 --> 00:05:36.700 align:middle line:90%
if we can do this?

00:05:36.700 --> 00:05:41.130 align:middle line:84%
And on top of that, what
are the implications of this

00:05:41.130 --> 00:05:47.740 align:middle line:84%
if the powers that be
know that we can do this?

00:05:47.740 --> 00:05:49.540 align:middle line:10%
So it makes sense
that we're kind

00:05:49.540 --> 00:05:54.880 align:middle line:10%
of being diverted away from
knowing that we can do this.

00:05:54.880 --> 00:06:03.800 align:middle line:10%
So I share this because we need
to know that we can do this.

00:06:03.800 --> 00:06:04.730 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:06:04.730 --> 00:06:05.820 align:middle line:90%
[CHEERS, APPLAUSE]

00:06:05.820 --> 00:06:06.640 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:06:06.640 --> 00:06:07.440 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:06:07.440 --> 00:06:09.950 align:middle line:90%


00:06:09.950 --> 00:06:10.820 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

00:06:10.820 --> 00:06:12.920 align:middle line:10%
So, yeah, that's
part of why I'm so

00:06:12.920 --> 00:06:19.500 align:middle line:10%
passionate about having people
know that we are amazing.

00:06:19.500 --> 00:06:22.510 align:middle line:10%
So I'm sure I'm
blowing my time here.

00:06:22.510 --> 00:06:23.310 align:middle line:10%
Let's go.

00:06:23.310 --> 00:06:29.000 align:middle line:84%
So Ingo Swann, he thought about
things, he called us Earth side,

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:31.440 align:middle line:84%
and he called everything
else space side.

00:06:31.440 --> 00:06:37.130 align:middle line:84%
And what he wondered was,
was telepathy and ESP,

00:06:37.130 --> 00:06:40.200 align:middle line:90%
possibly, a universal language?

00:06:40.200 --> 00:06:42.420 align:middle line:84%
And I think he has
something there,

00:06:42.420 --> 00:06:45.110 align:middle line:84%
and I'm willing to guess that a
lot of people at this conference

00:06:45.110 --> 00:06:49.220 align:middle line:84%
think he might have
something there as well.

00:06:49.220 --> 00:06:52.280 align:middle line:84%
I think it's a
pretty good guess.

00:06:52.280 --> 00:06:53.970 align:middle line:10%
Educated guess, let's call it.

00:06:53.970 --> 00:06:59.420 align:middle line:10%
So another thing,
could the right brain

00:06:59.420 --> 00:07:01.350 align:middle line:10%
functioning be a part of this?

00:07:01.350 --> 00:07:03.330 align:middle line:10%
Could it be our access?

00:07:03.330 --> 00:07:08.930 align:middle line:10%
So we can't say for certain,
but it kind of looks like it.

00:07:08.930 --> 00:07:11.810 align:middle line:84%
So I'm going to
move on to dreams,

00:07:11.810 --> 00:07:13.560 align:middle line:84%
because it's another
favorite place.

00:07:13.560 --> 00:07:16.520 align:middle line:84%
And the other reason is
because remote viewing,

00:07:16.520 --> 00:07:18.840 align:middle line:90%
you still need to do it well.

00:07:18.840 --> 00:07:21.260 align:middle line:84%
You need another party
to do it with you.

00:07:21.260 --> 00:07:25.110 align:middle line:84%
There are target pools
you can do online.

00:07:25.110 --> 00:07:28.410 align:middle line:90%
But dreams, this is our IP.

00:07:28.410 --> 00:07:29.760 align:middle line:90%
We own the dreams.

00:07:29.760 --> 00:07:30.600 align:middle line:90%
This is us.

00:07:30.600 --> 00:07:34.320 align:middle line:90%
It's accessible to all of us.

00:07:34.320 --> 00:07:36.000 align:middle line:90%
We don't have to feel psychic.

00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:38.900 align:middle line:84%
We don't have to feel special,
and it's running all the time

00:07:38.900 --> 00:07:39.750 align:middle line:90%
in the background.

00:07:39.750 --> 00:07:41.250 align:middle line:90%
So why not?

00:07:41.250 --> 00:07:42.090 align:middle line:90%
Why not?

00:07:42.090 --> 00:07:43.620 align:middle line:90%
Is there a doorway there?

00:07:43.620 --> 00:07:45.540 align:middle line:90%
Can we push it farther?

00:07:45.540 --> 00:07:47.960 align:middle line:84%
Can we put attention
on there, use

00:07:47.960 --> 00:07:49.820 align:middle line:84%
some ideas, experiments
on ourselves,

00:07:49.820 --> 00:07:52.140 align:middle line:84%
and see what else
we can open up?

00:07:52.140 --> 00:07:54.510 align:middle line:10%
Yes, I believe we can.

00:07:54.510 --> 00:07:56.330 align:middle line:10%
I love to experiment
on myself, so I'm

00:07:56.330 --> 00:07:58.820 align:middle line:10%
going to share some of
these things with you.

00:07:58.820 --> 00:08:01.320 align:middle line:84%
Another thing, this is
a way I think of it,

00:08:01.320 --> 00:08:03.530 align:middle line:90%
it's like a celestial stargate.

00:08:03.530 --> 00:08:05.280 align:middle line:84%
I was just talking
about Project Stargate.

00:08:05.280 --> 00:08:09.510 align:middle line:84%
Our dreams, to me, are
like a celestial stargate.

00:08:09.510 --> 00:08:11.110 align:middle line:90%
We haven't explored it.

00:08:11.110 --> 00:08:13.530 align:middle line:10%
So anyhow, why dreams?

00:08:13.530 --> 00:08:16.950 align:middle line:10%
Revered by ancient societies.

00:08:16.950 --> 00:08:20.790 align:middle line:10%
Isn't that odd, that
we don't go into it,

00:08:20.790 --> 00:08:26.080 align:middle line:10%
but it's been revered
forever by everyone?

00:08:26.080 --> 00:08:29.300 align:middle line:10%
And we just let it go,
go on with the day,

00:08:29.300 --> 00:08:31.300 align:middle line:10%
and we still have that
restless feeling all day.

00:08:31.300 --> 00:08:34.559 align:middle line:10%
And it's like, oh, we have this
whole mystical world inside

00:08:34.559 --> 00:08:36.340 align:middle line:10%
of us that we just
kind of forget about.

00:08:36.340 --> 00:08:40.110 align:middle line:10%
So I'm just inviting us back
to have a little look at this.

00:08:40.110 --> 00:08:42.210 align:middle line:10%
People journeyed
thousands of miles

00:08:42.210 --> 00:08:45.900 align:middle line:10%
to Delphi, to the Temple of
Apollo, to get their prophecies,

00:08:45.900 --> 00:08:49.640 align:middle line:10%
to have their
dreams interpreted.

00:08:49.640 --> 00:08:51.510 align:middle line:84%
I think there's
something to that.

00:08:51.510 --> 00:08:53.910 align:middle line:84%
A third of our lives
remains a mystery.

00:08:53.910 --> 00:08:55.310 align:middle line:90%
A third.

00:08:55.310 --> 00:08:56.340 align:middle line:90%
A third.

00:08:56.340 --> 00:08:59.060 align:middle line:84%
And inside that is
this mystical world.

00:08:59.060 --> 00:09:01.290 align:middle line:84%
There might be some
memory optimization.

00:09:01.290 --> 00:09:02.980 align:middle line:90%
We'll give them that as well.

00:09:02.980 --> 00:09:04.880 align:middle line:90%
I'm sure that is a thing.

00:09:04.880 --> 00:09:06.740 align:middle line:10%
I actually do
believe that's part,

00:09:06.740 --> 00:09:09.110 align:middle line:10%
but it doesn't
explain all of it.

00:09:09.110 --> 00:09:11.000 align:middle line:10%
So, yeah, no one
knows what they really

00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:12.720 align:middle line:10%
are, where they originate.

00:09:12.720 --> 00:09:14.440 align:middle line:90%
Fantastic mystery.

00:09:14.440 --> 00:09:19.740 align:middle line:84%
So dreams as a gateway to our
quantum computer, our Holodeck.

00:09:19.740 --> 00:09:20.630 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:09:20.630 --> 00:09:22.920 align:middle line:90%
So it's accessible.

00:09:22.920 --> 00:09:23.720 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:09:23.720 --> 00:09:26.000 align:middle line:10%
I'm going to skip.

00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:30.020 align:middle line:10%
Yes, really, I believe, it's
like learning to prompt it.

00:09:30.020 --> 00:09:35.060 align:middle line:10%
Input clear intent, learn
the language and conditions

00:09:35.060 --> 00:09:38.700 align:middle line:10%
that it responds to best when
it's communicating with us.

00:09:38.700 --> 00:09:42.770 align:middle line:10%
Because really, if you guys are
interested in any modalities,

00:09:42.770 --> 00:09:48.470 align:middle line:10%
whether it's tarot, whether
it's mediumship, intuition,

00:09:48.470 --> 00:09:51.230 align:middle line:10%
remote viewing, any
of these things,

00:09:51.230 --> 00:09:54.270 align:middle line:10%
it's all about the
art of the prompt.

00:09:54.270 --> 00:09:56.570 align:middle line:10%
Same with ChatGPT, right?

00:09:56.570 --> 00:10:00.450 align:middle line:10%
The prompt, honing the
question, honing the intent.

00:10:00.450 --> 00:10:03.710 align:middle line:10%
When you really get
that narrowed down,

00:10:03.710 --> 00:10:06.890 align:middle line:10%
you have a better chance
of opening up the answers

00:10:06.890 --> 00:10:07.860 align:middle line:10%
that you want.

00:10:07.860 --> 00:10:12.330 align:middle line:10%
So this is something you
want to apply to your dreams.

00:10:12.330 --> 00:10:14.730 align:middle line:10%
And, of course, we want
to understand how it's

00:10:14.730 --> 00:10:16.390 align:middle line:10%
communicating back with us.

00:10:16.390 --> 00:10:18.900 align:middle line:10%
That's why remote viewing
is so interesting to me,

00:10:18.900 --> 00:10:22.860 align:middle line:10%
because there was so much
to inform my dream world,

00:10:22.860 --> 00:10:25.560 align:middle line:10%
how I look at my
dreams, my dream study,

00:10:25.560 --> 00:10:27.010 align:middle line:10%
from remote viewing.

00:10:27.010 --> 00:10:29.610 align:middle line:10%
So, yeah, use dreams
as a bridge to access

00:10:29.610 --> 00:10:32.110 align:middle line:10%
this limitless potential
of us, our own Holodeck.

00:10:32.110 --> 00:10:33.240 align:middle line:10%
Absolutely.

00:10:33.240 --> 00:10:36.065 align:middle line:84%
This part is really
important to me,

00:10:36.065 --> 00:10:37.440 align:middle line:84%
and I want to
share this with you

00:10:37.440 --> 00:10:40.510 align:middle line:84%
because I know many people
have not heard about this yet.

00:10:40.510 --> 00:10:43.000 align:middle line:90%
This is Patricia Cyrus.

00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:46.560 align:middle line:84%
Funny enough, the woman that
I remote-viewed that day.

00:10:46.560 --> 00:10:50.640 align:middle line:84%
And we seem to be
a little entangled.

00:10:50.640 --> 00:10:52.030 align:middle line:10%
She showed up at my lecture--

00:10:52.030 --> 00:10:53.710 align:middle line:10%
I hadn't seen her in a decade--

00:10:53.710 --> 00:10:56.070 align:middle line:10%
this past summer and told me--

00:10:56.070 --> 00:10:57.340 align:middle line:10%
my lecture had the same title.

00:10:57.340 --> 00:11:00.880 align:middle line:10%
"Are we the quantum computers
that we're searching for?"

00:11:00.880 --> 00:11:04.350 align:middle line:10%
And she is doing a lecture
about quantum computers,

00:11:04.350 --> 00:11:06.520 align:middle line:10%
also about the brain.

00:11:06.520 --> 00:11:10.530 align:middle line:84%
She is actually trying to prove
with her colleague Daniel P.

00:11:10.530 --> 00:11:11.460 align:middle line:90%
Sheehan--

00:11:11.460 --> 00:11:15.100 align:middle line:84%
not this Daniel P. Sheehan
who's part of this conference.

00:11:15.100 --> 00:11:17.660 align:middle line:90%
A different Daniel P. Sheehan--

00:11:17.660 --> 00:11:22.240 align:middle line:84%
I know-- that works for the
University of San Diego,

00:11:22.240 --> 00:11:24.760 align:middle line:90%
in the Department of Physics.

00:11:24.760 --> 00:11:28.150 align:middle line:10%
They are trying to
prove scientifically

00:11:28.150 --> 00:11:29.990 align:middle line:10%
that the mind
actually is quantum.

00:11:29.990 --> 00:11:32.980 align:middle line:10%
So just a weird coincidence.

00:11:32.980 --> 00:11:36.650 align:middle line:10%
So she is responsible for
doing a study with Dale Graff.

00:11:36.650 --> 00:11:39.250 align:middle line:84%
And if any of you are
following remote viewing,

00:11:39.250 --> 00:11:43.900 align:middle line:84%
Dale Graff was in charge of
the Project Stargate program

00:11:43.900 --> 00:11:46.040 align:middle line:90%
for the longest amount of time.

00:11:46.040 --> 00:11:51.010 align:middle line:84%
But little known fact about
Dale is that he's super psychic,

00:11:51.010 --> 00:11:54.410 align:middle line:84%
and he is super
psychic in his dreams.

00:11:54.410 --> 00:11:56.830 align:middle line:84%
So this is one of
the first studies

00:11:56.830 --> 00:11:59.590 align:middle line:90%
I've ever seen like this.

00:11:59.590 --> 00:12:08.860 align:middle line:10%
Triple blind, precognitive
remote viewing in your dreams.

00:12:08.860 --> 00:12:10.240 align:middle line:10%
Yes.

00:12:10.240 --> 00:12:12.170 align:middle line:10%
So I gotta share this.

00:12:12.170 --> 00:12:14.840 align:middle line:10%
I got to tell all the people
that show up about this.

00:12:14.840 --> 00:12:16.040 align:middle line:10%
It's so exciting.

00:12:16.040 --> 00:12:19.150 align:middle line:10%
So 75% of this
study, I would say,

00:12:19.150 --> 00:12:21.970 align:middle line:10%
generally when I ask them-- they
don't have an exact figure--

00:12:21.970 --> 00:12:23.270 align:middle line:10%
was done in dreamwork.

00:12:23.270 --> 00:12:24.730 align:middle line:84%
If they don't have
the dream, they

00:12:24.730 --> 00:12:27.640 align:middle line:84%
will then default to
conscious remote viewing.

00:12:27.640 --> 00:12:29.450 align:middle line:84%
Triple blind, I just
want to explain this.

00:12:29.450 --> 00:12:31.930 align:middle line:84%
So I'm going to use
my husband here.

00:12:31.930 --> 00:12:34.018 align:middle line:90%
So if I'm the remote viewer--

00:12:34.018 --> 00:12:35.560 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to talk
about single blind.

00:12:35.560 --> 00:12:38.320 align:middle line:84%
If I'm the remote viewer,
he is hiding a target

00:12:38.320 --> 00:12:39.800 align:middle line:90%
in an envelope from me.

00:12:39.800 --> 00:12:41.150 align:middle line:90%
That's a single blind.

00:12:41.150 --> 00:12:42.620 align:middle line:90%
I don't know what the target is.

00:12:42.620 --> 00:12:43.420 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:12:43.420 --> 00:12:48.460 align:middle line:10%
Double blind would mean someone
else conceals the target,

00:12:48.460 --> 00:12:51.550 align:middle line:10%
gives him the already
closed envelope.

00:12:51.550 --> 00:12:53.330 align:middle line:10%
So even he doesn't
know what it is.

00:12:53.330 --> 00:12:54.560 align:middle line:10%
That's double blind.

00:12:54.560 --> 00:12:56.330 align:middle line:10%
We both don't know
what the target is.

00:12:56.330 --> 00:12:59.810 align:middle line:10%
Triple blind is like
future remote view.

00:12:59.810 --> 00:13:01.930 align:middle line:10%
Nobody knows what it is.

00:13:01.930 --> 00:13:03.560 align:middle line:90%
So it's amazing.

00:13:03.560 --> 00:13:06.130 align:middle line:84%
And you're like, how
would you do that?

00:13:06.130 --> 00:13:08.600 align:middle line:84%
But they do it
with the newspaper.

00:13:08.600 --> 00:13:11.670 align:middle line:84%
So they'll pick a day
far out in the newspaper.

00:13:11.670 --> 00:13:15.600 align:middle line:84%
They pick a certain spot, like
A6 of this exact newspaper.

00:13:15.600 --> 00:13:18.170 align:middle line:84%
You have to do all this
research to see, when

00:13:18.170 --> 00:13:19.520 align:middle line:90%
does the photo get published?

00:13:19.520 --> 00:13:22.680 align:middle line:84%
When does the event usually
take place on that page?

00:13:22.680 --> 00:13:27.740 align:middle line:84%
And so they will remote-view
it far enough back that they

00:13:27.740 --> 00:13:32.150 align:middle line:84%
know the event hasn't
happened, the pictures

00:13:32.150 --> 00:13:33.750 align:middle line:90%
get chosen on the Tuesday.

00:13:33.750 --> 00:13:35.810 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to show
you a calendar.

00:13:35.810 --> 00:13:37.280 align:middle line:90%
There's just no way.

00:13:37.280 --> 00:13:38.820 align:middle line:90%
It has not occurred.

00:13:38.820 --> 00:13:42.920 align:middle line:10%
And they had, out of 33--

00:13:42.920 --> 00:13:46.850 align:middle line:10%
this whole experiment was
33 different remote-viewing

00:13:46.850 --> 00:13:50.850 align:middle line:10%
sessions, and they
got 21 correct.

00:13:50.850 --> 00:13:52.692 align:middle line:10%
And they're amazing, too.

00:13:52.692 --> 00:13:53.900 align:middle line:10%
I brought to you to show you.

00:13:53.900 --> 00:13:54.990 align:middle line:10%
I was so excited.

00:13:54.990 --> 00:13:59.210 align:middle line:84%
So this is kind of what
it looks like, quickly.

00:13:59.210 --> 00:14:01.360 align:middle line:84%
So here it is, what I
was trying to explain.

00:14:01.360 --> 00:14:02.610 align:middle line:10%
This might be a little easier.

00:14:02.610 --> 00:14:05.180 align:middle line:10%
So on the Friday,
the viewer agrees

00:14:05.180 --> 00:14:08.010 align:middle line:10%
to the precognition session.

00:14:08.010 --> 00:14:12.850 align:middle line:10%
On the Saturday, they're going
to go to sleep with the target.

00:14:12.850 --> 00:14:15.672 align:middle line:10%
And then if they don't get it,
they'll do it Sunday as well.

00:14:15.672 --> 00:14:17.130 align:middle line:10%
Then they can
conscious-remote-view

00:14:17.130 --> 00:14:18.010 align:middle line:10%
if they don't get it.

00:14:18.010 --> 00:14:20.640 align:middle line:10%
But they basically did
75% of this with dreams.

00:14:20.640 --> 00:14:23.410 align:middle line:10%
And Dale exclusively dreams.

00:14:23.410 --> 00:14:24.730 align:middle line:10%
This is what's so amazing.

00:14:24.730 --> 00:14:30.030 align:middle line:84%
So the photograph gets
selected on the Tuesday,

00:14:30.030 --> 00:14:33.130 align:middle line:84%
and the actual paper I
think is on the Wednesday.

00:14:33.130 --> 00:14:35.293 align:middle line:84%
So total future
remote view, nobody

00:14:35.293 --> 00:14:36.460 align:middle line:90%
knows what it's going to be.

00:14:36.460 --> 00:14:37.990 align:middle line:10%
Here's an example.

00:14:37.990 --> 00:14:38.790 align:middle line:10%
OK?

00:14:38.790 --> 00:14:40.950 align:middle line:10%
This is-- the
writing's too small

00:14:40.950 --> 00:14:43.380 align:middle line:10%
for me to see here--
the target photograph,

00:14:43.380 --> 00:14:45.510 align:middle line:10%
Indonesian ship bombing.

00:14:45.510 --> 00:14:48.970 align:middle line:84%
And then this was
the remote view,

00:14:48.970 --> 00:14:52.000 align:middle line:84%
which is described like this--
curving metal, large boat,

00:14:52.000 --> 00:14:52.800 align:middle line:90%
shipwreck.

00:14:52.800 --> 00:14:53.800 align:middle line:90%
Now, this is different.

00:14:53.800 --> 00:14:55.590 align:middle line:90%
They went off the no-naming.

00:14:55.590 --> 00:14:58.290 align:middle line:84%
They probably went
through their own process.

00:14:58.290 --> 00:14:59.790 align:middle line:84%
Once you've done
it for a long time,

00:14:59.790 --> 00:15:01.270 align:middle line:84%
you make your own
hybrid version.

00:15:01.270 --> 00:15:03.250 align:middle line:84%
But anyhow, this
is what they got.

00:15:03.250 --> 00:15:04.930 align:middle line:84%
Curving metal, large
boat, shipwreck.

00:15:04.930 --> 00:15:05.950 align:middle line:90%
There's the drawing.

00:15:05.950 --> 00:15:09.390 align:middle line:84%
And they noted that this
was done more than 20 hours

00:15:09.390 --> 00:15:16.350 align:middle line:84%
before the event occurred, this
ship bombing, more than 48 hours

00:15:16.350 --> 00:15:19.230 align:middle line:84%
between the remote-view session
and the picture even being

00:15:19.230 --> 00:15:21.610 align:middle line:90%
chosen for publication.

00:15:21.610 --> 00:15:23.590 align:middle line:90%
So that's amazing.

00:15:23.590 --> 00:15:25.530 align:middle line:90%
Look at this one.

00:15:25.530 --> 00:15:27.760 align:middle line:90%
This is my other example.

00:15:27.760 --> 00:15:31.450 align:middle line:84%
I believe this is Dale's
dream remote view.

00:15:31.450 --> 00:15:34.810 align:middle line:84%
But no matter what, the
remote view of the future.

00:15:34.810 --> 00:15:35.900 align:middle line:90%
This is amazing.

00:15:35.900 --> 00:15:36.700 align:middle line:90%
Amazing.

00:15:36.700 --> 00:15:37.950 align:middle line:90%
There's the target photograph.

00:15:37.950 --> 00:15:39.050 align:middle line:90%
This is Buddhist monks.

00:15:39.050 --> 00:15:41.120 align:middle line:84%
Over here are the
drawings, you can see.

00:15:41.120 --> 00:15:43.930 align:middle line:84%
And it says, "hundreds
of people in choir robes,

00:15:43.930 --> 00:15:47.710 align:middle line:84%
brightly lit concert,
inside a building."

00:15:47.710 --> 00:15:50.440 align:middle line:84%
Even the colors are
right, the dimensions.

00:15:50.440 --> 00:15:52.280 align:middle line:90%
It's like stadium seating.

00:15:52.280 --> 00:15:54.050 align:middle line:90%
It's just absolutely amazing.

00:15:54.050 --> 00:15:57.340 align:middle line:84%
So these were done in
controlled conditions.

00:15:57.340 --> 00:15:59.123 align:middle line:90%
And what does this really mean?

00:15:59.123 --> 00:16:02.310 align:middle line:90%


00:16:02.310 --> 00:16:05.710 align:middle line:10%
They're looking at the
study because they believe

00:16:05.710 --> 00:16:10.330 align:middle line:10%
that if your mind can
go outside of time,

00:16:10.330 --> 00:16:15.630 align:middle line:10%
to the future, that would
mean that it's nonlinear.

00:16:15.630 --> 00:16:19.090 align:middle line:10%
That would mean
that it's quantum.

00:16:19.090 --> 00:16:24.940 align:middle line:84%
So this is what Patricia
Cyrus and the other Daniel P.

00:16:24.940 --> 00:16:27.820 align:middle line:84%
Sheehan at the
University of San Diego

00:16:27.820 --> 00:16:30.730 align:middle line:84%
are attempting to
prove scientifically,

00:16:30.730 --> 00:16:32.830 align:middle line:90%
that the mind is quantum.

00:16:32.830 --> 00:16:33.880 align:middle line:90%
Amazing.

00:16:33.880 --> 00:16:35.540 align:middle line:90%
What's AI got to do with this?

00:16:35.540 --> 00:16:41.360 align:middle line:84%
Well, they figure this would
be a great new Turing test.

00:16:41.360 --> 00:16:44.330 align:middle line:84%
Because if you're following AI
and you know what the Turing

00:16:44.330 --> 00:16:47.930 align:middle line:84%
test is-- and if you don't,
Alan Turing created this in--

00:16:47.930 --> 00:16:49.350 align:middle line:90%
I think it was the '50s.

00:16:49.350 --> 00:16:51.620 align:middle line:84%
And basically, it's when you
can't tell the difference

00:16:51.620 --> 00:16:54.130 align:middle line:90%
of a human and AI.

00:16:54.130 --> 00:16:54.930 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:16:54.930 --> 00:16:57.690 align:middle line:84%
So they're saying this
would be a perfect test.

00:16:57.690 --> 00:17:01.130 align:middle line:84%
Future remote viewing,
triple blind, precognitive,

00:17:01.130 --> 00:17:02.800 align:middle line:90%
in your dreams.

00:17:02.800 --> 00:17:07.182 align:middle line:84%
They're speculating that a
computer couldn't do this,

00:17:07.182 --> 00:17:08.890 align:middle line:84%
that this would be
one of the only things

00:17:08.890 --> 00:17:10.210 align:middle line:90%
that it could not do.

00:17:10.210 --> 00:17:11.198 align:middle line:90%
I don't know.

00:17:11.198 --> 00:17:12.740 align:middle line:84%
I don't know about
quantum computers.

00:17:12.740 --> 00:17:13.630 align:middle line:90%
I don't know.

00:17:13.630 --> 00:17:15.710 align:middle line:84%
But I think that's
pretty brilliant.

00:17:15.710 --> 00:17:19.569 align:middle line:84%
And so they are out proposing
this to Roger Penrose

00:17:19.569 --> 00:17:22.329 align:middle line:84%
and all of the greatest
scientists out there.

00:17:22.329 --> 00:17:23.129 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:17:23.129 --> 00:17:25.329 align:middle line:84%
So it's always important
to talk about these things,

00:17:25.329 --> 00:17:26.839 align:middle line:90%
but then bring it back to us.

00:17:26.839 --> 00:17:29.200 align:middle line:90%
What can we do about this?

00:17:29.200 --> 00:17:30.320 align:middle line:90%
This is about us.

00:17:30.320 --> 00:17:35.260 align:middle line:84%
So for me, my dreams were never
like a mish-mash of the day.

00:17:35.260 --> 00:17:37.010 align:middle line:84%
They were never what
I was supposed to be.

00:17:37.010 --> 00:17:39.110 align:middle line:84%
I'm just going to
share one really fast.

00:17:39.110 --> 00:17:41.330 align:middle line:90%
I'm sure you guys have many.

00:17:41.330 --> 00:17:43.640 align:middle line:84%
I love having conversations
about dreams with people,

00:17:43.640 --> 00:17:44.800 align:middle line:90%
all their freaky dreams.

00:17:44.800 --> 00:17:46.600 align:middle line:90%
Bring them.

00:17:46.600 --> 00:17:47.740 align:middle line:90%
I love it.

00:17:47.740 --> 00:17:51.580 align:middle line:84%
But here's just an example
of one when I was younger.

00:17:51.580 --> 00:17:53.090 align:middle line:90%
It's not a mish-mash of the day.

00:17:53.090 --> 00:17:56.920 align:middle line:84%
So I meet my doctor,
but I meet him

00:17:56.920 --> 00:18:01.240 align:middle line:84%
a couple of floors up outside
of a building, hovering there.

00:18:01.240 --> 00:18:04.920 align:middle line:84%
And he's showing me this giant
clock with these numbers,

00:18:04.920 --> 00:18:09.170 align:middle line:84%
and he tells me he's
going to explain to me how

00:18:09.170 --> 00:18:11.370 align:middle line:90%
to go sideways through time.

00:18:11.370 --> 00:18:14.010 align:middle line:10%
And so he teaches me to stare.

00:18:14.010 --> 00:18:17.340 align:middle line:10%
So we're hovering above the
ground, this brick building,

00:18:17.340 --> 00:18:21.030 align:middle line:10%
that I have to focus,
focus, and absolutely

00:18:21.030 --> 00:18:23.650 align:middle line:10%
can't lose my focus
on this brick wall.

00:18:23.650 --> 00:18:25.200 align:middle line:10%
And so I think, what?

00:18:25.200 --> 00:18:27.960 align:middle line:10%
And I'm doing it, and
it eventually opens.

00:18:27.960 --> 00:18:30.840 align:middle line:10%
And I walk through, and there's
this big table of people.

00:18:30.840 --> 00:18:33.360 align:middle line:10%
And they all stop talking,
and they're all looking at me.

00:18:33.360 --> 00:18:36.570 align:middle line:10%
And I walk on through, and then
there's this little market.

00:18:36.570 --> 00:18:41.070 align:middle line:10%
And all the little market
booths are showing me--

00:18:41.070 --> 00:18:43.440 align:middle line:10%
the people there are
showing me things

00:18:43.440 --> 00:18:45.070 align:middle line:10%
that I could use in real life.

00:18:45.070 --> 00:18:47.157 align:middle line:10%
So I was doing a lot of
painting at the time.

00:18:47.157 --> 00:18:48.990 align:middle line:10%
So one of the things I
remember really well,

00:18:48.990 --> 00:18:53.980 align:middle line:10%
they were showing me these new
canvases that were textured.

00:18:53.980 --> 00:18:56.190 align:middle line:10%
They had the texture
built into them.

00:18:56.190 --> 00:18:57.930 align:middle line:10%
So it was like part
of the painting phase

00:18:57.930 --> 00:18:59.590 align:middle line:10%
was already taken care of.

00:18:59.590 --> 00:19:01.200 align:middle line:10%
And I don't know.

00:19:01.200 --> 00:19:03.690 align:middle line:10%
This is not a
mish-mash of the day.

00:19:03.690 --> 00:19:05.500 align:middle line:90%
That's just one example.

00:19:05.500 --> 00:19:07.360 align:middle line:90%
I make my way back out.

00:19:07.360 --> 00:19:10.230 align:middle line:84%
And right there, my
doctor, who was actually

00:19:10.230 --> 00:19:13.480 align:middle line:84%
my doctor at the
time, was showing me

00:19:13.480 --> 00:19:16.180 align:middle line:90%
that time had not changed.

00:19:16.180 --> 00:19:18.890 align:middle line:90%
Actually, no time had passed.

00:19:18.890 --> 00:19:20.180 align:middle line:90%
And I don't know.

00:19:20.180 --> 00:19:22.150 align:middle line:90%
So that's just one.

00:19:22.150 --> 00:19:25.690 align:middle line:84%
I've had other ones where
I'm being drugged repeatedly,

00:19:25.690 --> 00:19:30.550 align:middle line:84%
waking up in a gurney in the
top of someone's mansion.

00:19:30.550 --> 00:19:34.070 align:middle line:84%
And I come to, and
I see these people.

00:19:34.070 --> 00:19:38.830 align:middle line:84%
The thing is the dream
keeps continuing on.

00:19:38.830 --> 00:19:41.480 align:middle line:84%
When they noticed I was
awake, they redrugged me.

00:19:41.480 --> 00:19:44.530 align:middle line:84%
And then waking up again,
feeling super groggy,

00:19:44.530 --> 00:19:46.540 align:middle line:84%
and then seeing the
wife coming over

00:19:46.540 --> 00:19:50.000 align:middle line:84%
and getting upset that
these people had me there.

00:19:50.000 --> 00:19:51.980 align:middle line:84%
And she was saying, you
have to get rid of her.

00:19:51.980 --> 00:19:52.780 align:middle line:90%
Anyhow.

00:19:52.780 --> 00:19:54.230 align:middle line:90%
More happens in this dream.

00:19:54.230 --> 00:19:56.030 align:middle line:90%
They take me to the airport.

00:19:56.030 --> 00:20:01.990 align:middle line:84%
I am begging them, sobbing,
not to leave me at this airport

00:20:01.990 --> 00:20:05.650 align:middle line:84%
because I can't
remember who I am.

00:20:05.650 --> 00:20:10.780 align:middle line:10%
I woke up sobbing, feeling
it in my whole body,

00:20:10.780 --> 00:20:14.410 align:middle line:10%
because I was so
afraid of being left.

00:20:14.410 --> 00:20:18.070 align:middle line:10%
Because whoever they were,
I don't know my captors,

00:20:18.070 --> 00:20:20.860 align:middle line:10%
I don't know what
they were, they were

00:20:20.860 --> 00:20:22.300 align:middle line:10%
the only people I recognized.

00:20:22.300 --> 00:20:24.050 align:middle line:90%
And I didn't know where to go.

00:20:24.050 --> 00:20:26.090 align:middle line:84%
I didn't know how
I would get there.

00:20:26.090 --> 00:20:30.730 align:middle line:84%
And I carried this into
my waking for a while.

00:20:30.730 --> 00:20:32.030 align:middle line:90%
I couldn't shake it.

00:20:32.030 --> 00:20:37.740 align:middle line:10%
And you have dreams like
that, and you just think,

00:20:37.740 --> 00:20:39.880 align:middle line:10%
I don't know, it's
something else at play.

00:20:39.880 --> 00:20:41.590 align:middle line:10%
There's a lot for
us to dig into.

00:20:41.590 --> 00:20:42.710 align:middle line:10%
Anyhow.

00:20:42.710 --> 00:20:46.400 align:middle line:10%
So you are the Holodeck.

00:20:46.400 --> 00:20:47.970 align:middle line:90%
Let's use the Holodeck.

00:20:47.970 --> 00:20:48.870 align:middle line:90%
Let's experiment.

00:20:48.870 --> 00:20:50.030 align:middle line:90%
Let's get in there.

00:20:50.030 --> 00:20:55.160 align:middle line:84%
So some of the things
that I did to up my game.

00:20:55.160 --> 00:20:58.280 align:middle line:84%
So I knew right away I had
to create a dream scale.

00:20:58.280 --> 00:21:01.160 align:middle line:84%
Because if they're telling me
it's a mish-mash of the day, OK.

00:21:01.160 --> 00:21:03.390 align:middle line:90%
How often is it that?

00:21:03.390 --> 00:21:06.120 align:middle line:84%
So I'll go into
that in a second.

00:21:06.120 --> 00:21:09.020 align:middle line:10%
Self-audits, something that I've
done on myself for a long time,

00:21:09.020 --> 00:21:12.140 align:middle line:10%
but in normal life, and I've
just applied it to dreams.

00:21:12.140 --> 00:21:16.070 align:middle line:10%
And that's just like, say
you're at a Christmas party

00:21:16.070 --> 00:21:18.140 align:middle line:10%
with your family,
and your sister

00:21:18.140 --> 00:21:21.920 align:middle line:10%
says to you that you have
some undesirable behavior.

00:21:21.920 --> 00:21:23.990 align:middle line:90%
And you're like, I do not.

00:21:23.990 --> 00:21:26.780 align:middle line:84%
So a little psychological
trick you can do on yourself

00:21:26.780 --> 00:21:29.030 align:middle line:90%
is put a little self-audit on.

00:21:29.030 --> 00:21:33.320 align:middle line:84%
Because we can
program our minds.

00:21:33.320 --> 00:21:36.360 align:middle line:84%
Part of my psych degree, I
had this psychology professor

00:21:36.360 --> 00:21:37.255 align:middle line:90%
that was amazing.

00:21:37.255 --> 00:21:39.380 align:middle line:84%
He sent us home with psych
experiments on ourselves

00:21:39.380 --> 00:21:40.180 align:middle line:90%
all the time.

00:21:40.180 --> 00:21:42.830 align:middle line:84%
So this is where this
comes from in me.

00:21:42.830 --> 00:21:46.420 align:middle line:84%
But you can put this
program on yourself.

00:21:46.420 --> 00:21:47.790 align:middle line:90%
You program.

00:21:47.790 --> 00:21:48.990 align:middle line:90%
You make a decision.

00:21:48.990 --> 00:21:50.560 align:middle line:90%
You don't have counter-thoughts.

00:21:50.560 --> 00:21:52.230 align:middle line:90%
You can apply this to anything.

00:21:52.230 --> 00:21:54.640 align:middle line:84%
And you're just like, I
want a tap on the shoulder

00:21:54.640 --> 00:21:55.440 align:middle line:90%
if I ever do this.

00:21:55.440 --> 00:21:57.690 align:middle line:10%
You're putting something
on your subconscious mind,

00:21:57.690 --> 00:22:00.070 align:middle line:10%
and you're saying,
bring it forward.

00:22:00.070 --> 00:22:01.175 align:middle line:90%
I want to know.

00:22:01.175 --> 00:22:02.800 align:middle line:84%
I give it a time
frame, like two weeks.

00:22:02.800 --> 00:22:04.020 align:middle line:90%
Please bring it forward.

00:22:04.020 --> 00:22:06.300 align:middle line:10%
And the tap will come,
and you won't notice.

00:22:06.300 --> 00:22:08.530 align:middle line:10%
Because it's been a
subconscious behavior.

00:22:08.530 --> 00:22:12.280 align:middle line:10%
And you remind yourself,
I want to know.

00:22:12.280 --> 00:22:15.310 align:middle line:84%
And eventually it
is going to happen.

00:22:15.310 --> 00:22:18.510 align:middle line:84%
Probably when you relax
one night, about a week in,

00:22:18.510 --> 00:22:20.040 align:middle line:90%
you'll remember.

00:22:20.040 --> 00:22:21.350 align:middle line:90%
Oh, yeah, I had that tap.

00:22:21.350 --> 00:22:22.150 align:middle line:90%
I'm a freak.

00:22:22.150 --> 00:22:24.070 align:middle line:10%
I do have that behavior.

00:22:24.070 --> 00:22:26.610 align:middle line:10%
So you can apply this
to your dreamworld.

00:22:26.610 --> 00:22:30.420 align:middle line:10%
Again, it's that focus, that
intent, that conviction.

00:22:30.420 --> 00:22:35.730 align:middle line:10%
Joe McMoneagle, Uri Geller,
these most famous psychics,

00:22:35.730 --> 00:22:36.850 align:middle line:10%
they talk about this.

00:22:36.850 --> 00:22:38.550 align:middle line:84%
They wanted everyone
in the room,

00:22:38.550 --> 00:22:42.030 align:middle line:84%
everyone involved, to
have their intent focused.

00:22:42.030 --> 00:22:44.550 align:middle line:84%
Because this is how they
felt their success came.

00:22:44.550 --> 00:22:48.910 align:middle line:84%
So we need to use this for
ourselves, to open this up.

00:22:48.910 --> 00:22:51.115 align:middle line:84%
The dream scale for
me looks like this.

00:22:51.115 --> 00:22:52.573 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to give
it as an example.

00:22:52.573 --> 00:22:55.440 align:middle line:90%


00:22:55.440 --> 00:22:57.130 align:middle line:84%
Yours is probably
going to be different.

00:22:57.130 --> 00:23:01.080 align:middle line:84%
But this is, again, just
to help you with a tool.

00:23:01.080 --> 00:23:03.840 align:middle line:84%
Because tracking is going to be
really important of your dreams.

00:23:03.840 --> 00:23:04.640 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:23:04.640 --> 00:23:06.690 align:middle line:84%
Mish-mash of the day
was my category one.

00:23:06.690 --> 00:23:09.180 align:middle line:90%
My category two, mini vignettes.

00:23:09.180 --> 00:23:10.720 align:middle line:90%
Little mini-metaphor dreams.

00:23:10.720 --> 00:23:12.360 align:middle line:90%
They come in little bits.

00:23:12.360 --> 00:23:15.150 align:middle line:84%
Number three was they
were more meaningful.

00:23:15.150 --> 00:23:19.950 align:middle line:84%
I cared about them more, so
they got a higher category.

00:23:19.950 --> 00:23:23.610 align:middle line:84%
Four for me was like a
twisting, long-story narrative,

00:23:23.610 --> 00:23:28.410 align:middle line:84%
kind of like the drugging one
I was telling you a portion of.

00:23:28.410 --> 00:23:30.330 align:middle line:90%
Category five for me.

00:23:30.330 --> 00:23:31.990 align:middle line:90%
This was kind of the highest.

00:23:31.990 --> 00:23:35.190 align:middle line:90%
So extraordinarily vivid detail.

00:23:35.190 --> 00:23:39.210 align:middle line:84%
Very, very heightened awareness,
awareness that you're asleep

00:23:39.210 --> 00:23:42.420 align:middle line:84%
and that you're dreaming,
which is lucid dreams.

00:23:42.420 --> 00:23:46.530 align:middle line:84%
Or you received details that
predicted something or came true

00:23:46.530 --> 00:23:48.940 align:middle line:84%
in reality, precognitive
information.

00:23:48.940 --> 00:23:50.400 align:middle line:84%
Obviously, with
precognitive, you

00:23:50.400 --> 00:23:52.620 align:middle line:84%
don't know when you wake
up, generally speaking,

00:23:52.620 --> 00:23:54.610 align:middle line:84%
that you're going to have
a precognitive dream.

00:23:54.610 --> 00:23:58.110 align:middle line:84%
And a lot of mind that I
thought I didn't care about,

00:23:58.110 --> 00:24:00.690 align:middle line:84%
I just thought they
weren't that important,

00:24:00.690 --> 00:24:02.200 align:middle line:90%
they end up being the ones.

00:24:02.200 --> 00:24:04.960 align:middle line:84%
So this is reason to
write your dreams down.

00:24:04.960 --> 00:24:07.380 align:middle line:90%
And then I have a category six.

00:24:07.380 --> 00:24:13.550 align:middle line:10%
Anyone who has had a suspected
contact dream in their life.

00:24:13.550 --> 00:24:18.590 align:middle line:10%
There is a category where
you know it wasn't a dream.

00:24:18.590 --> 00:24:22.290 align:middle line:10%
But it occurred at night, and
so we put it in that category.

00:24:22.290 --> 00:24:24.560 align:middle line:10%
So I want to break
those out, and I think

00:24:24.560 --> 00:24:26.420 align:middle line:10%
we should all break those out.

00:24:26.420 --> 00:24:29.180 align:middle line:10%
It doesn't mean that
you know for sure,

00:24:29.180 --> 00:24:32.330 align:middle line:10%
but what it means is
you're going to hold that

00:24:32.330 --> 00:24:34.700 align:middle line:10%
because something in
you knows it wasn't.

00:24:34.700 --> 00:24:37.740 align:middle line:10%
And you account for those.

00:24:37.740 --> 00:24:38.540 align:middle line:10%
OK?

00:24:38.540 --> 00:24:39.510 align:middle line:10%
Yes.

00:24:39.510 --> 00:24:40.370 align:middle line:10%
Yes.

00:24:40.370 --> 00:24:41.880 align:middle line:10%
Don't let those go.

00:24:41.880 --> 00:24:44.700 align:middle line:10%
Nobody can take that
away from you, right?

00:24:44.700 --> 00:24:45.840 align:middle line:10%
And write it down.

00:24:45.840 --> 00:24:47.600 align:middle line:10%
And I'd probably talk
about this later,

00:24:47.600 --> 00:24:49.560 align:middle line:10%
but I'm going to talk
about it right now.

00:24:49.560 --> 00:24:51.990 align:middle line:10%
The things that we
know about memory.

00:24:51.990 --> 00:24:54.740 align:middle line:10%
When you have a
memory about something

00:24:54.740 --> 00:24:57.590 align:middle line:10%
and you continually bring
it out and talk about it,

00:24:57.590 --> 00:25:00.300 align:middle line:10%
we now know that it changes.

00:25:00.300 --> 00:25:01.410 align:middle line:10%
It's true.

00:25:01.410 --> 00:25:02.460 align:middle line:10%
It changes.

00:25:02.460 --> 00:25:04.580 align:middle line:10%
What happens is you
take it out and tell it.

00:25:04.580 --> 00:25:06.890 align:middle line:10%
And everything going
on in the environment

00:25:06.890 --> 00:25:09.360 align:middle line:10%
adds to it every
time you take it out.

00:25:09.360 --> 00:25:11.300 align:middle line:10%
I'm telling you this
because if you ever

00:25:11.300 --> 00:25:16.240 align:middle line:10%
have encounters or
things that happen,

00:25:16.240 --> 00:25:18.850 align:middle line:10%
I can't stress enough the
importance of writing it

00:25:18.850 --> 00:25:22.990 align:middle line:10%
down and drawing it
immediately, just in case.

00:25:22.990 --> 00:25:25.610 align:middle line:90%
Immediately upon waking.

00:25:25.610 --> 00:25:27.900 align:middle line:90%
Make that archive for yourself.

00:25:27.900 --> 00:25:29.800 align:middle line:90%
You deserve to have that.

00:25:29.800 --> 00:25:31.273 align:middle line:90%
It's going to be very important.

00:25:31.273 --> 00:25:33.190 align:middle line:84%
So when you wake up and
you have that feeling,

00:25:33.190 --> 00:25:35.120 align:middle line:90%
get it down as fast as you can.

00:25:35.120 --> 00:25:37.960 align:middle line:84%
So, obviously,
capturing precognition

00:25:37.960 --> 00:25:40.270 align:middle line:84%
is very important
to us understanding

00:25:40.270 --> 00:25:41.850 align:middle line:90%
the nature of ourselves.

00:25:41.850 --> 00:25:43.310 align:middle line:90%
Very important.

00:25:43.310 --> 00:25:45.750 align:middle line:84%
So I just want to tell you
this one dream, maybe two.

00:25:45.750 --> 00:25:46.550 align:middle line:90%
I don't know.

00:25:46.550 --> 00:25:47.650 align:middle line:90%
We'll see.

00:25:47.650 --> 00:25:50.210 align:middle line:84%
Because I've been studying
my dreams for decades.

00:25:50.210 --> 00:25:51.470 align:middle line:90%
And I know they're important.

00:25:51.470 --> 00:25:53.980 align:middle line:84%
I don't believe that
they're just nothing.

00:25:53.980 --> 00:25:56.500 align:middle line:90%
I had this cruise ship dream.

00:25:56.500 --> 00:25:58.720 align:middle line:90%
And this is unusual.

00:25:58.720 --> 00:25:59.540 align:middle line:90%
This is not normal.

00:25:59.540 --> 00:26:00.970 align:middle line:90%
I'm sitting in the cruise ship.

00:26:00.970 --> 00:26:03.110 align:middle line:90%
So I'm with all of the people.

00:26:03.110 --> 00:26:07.120 align:middle line:84%
And the weird thing
was a storm comes,

00:26:07.120 --> 00:26:10.690 align:middle line:84%
and all of a sudden the
ship starts going up slowly,

00:26:10.690 --> 00:26:15.140 align:middle line:84%
like a big wave is coming,
but it completely capsized.

00:26:15.140 --> 00:26:16.370 align:middle line:90%
Super slow.

00:26:16.370 --> 00:26:17.940 align:middle line:90%
Capsizes.

00:26:17.940 --> 00:26:19.970 align:middle line:84%
When I woke up from
that dream, just

00:26:19.970 --> 00:26:23.600 align:middle line:84%
from studying myself my whole
life, knowing, studying water

00:26:23.600 --> 00:26:28.940 align:middle line:84%
and that I was with a small
civilization, and I was with it,

00:26:28.940 --> 00:26:32.810 align:middle line:90%
I knew something was coming.

00:26:32.810 --> 00:26:35.060 align:middle line:10%
Because I never dream like this.

00:26:35.060 --> 00:26:36.870 align:middle line:10%
Never dream like this.

00:26:36.870 --> 00:26:41.090 align:middle line:10%
But my dream language that
I've been studying, I knew.

00:26:41.090 --> 00:26:42.260 align:middle line:10%
I probably told Richard.

00:26:42.260 --> 00:26:43.110 align:middle line:10%
Poor Richard.

00:26:43.110 --> 00:26:47.660 align:middle line:10%
He hears my dreams
every day, all the time.

00:26:47.660 --> 00:26:48.470 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:26:48.470 --> 00:26:49.555 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:26:49.555 --> 00:26:52.490 align:middle line:90%


00:26:52.490 --> 00:26:53.795 align:middle line:10%
My mom, too.

00:26:53.795 --> 00:26:55.700 align:middle line:10%
Oh, god.

00:26:55.700 --> 00:26:57.560 align:middle line:10%
My whole life.

00:26:57.560 --> 00:26:59.540 align:middle line:10%
I had another dream.

00:26:59.540 --> 00:27:00.770 align:middle line:10%
But yeah.

00:27:00.770 --> 00:27:04.380 align:middle line:10%
And this was early 2020.

00:27:04.380 --> 00:27:06.270 align:middle line:10%
This was pre-COVID.

00:27:06.270 --> 00:27:08.870 align:middle line:10%
So I'll tell this
one really quick.

00:27:08.870 --> 00:27:12.170 align:middle line:84%
Another time, my
father had passed.

00:27:12.170 --> 00:27:15.260 align:middle line:10%
And my mom, my sister,
and my niece and I

00:27:15.260 --> 00:27:18.630 align:middle line:10%
were trying to have a
little family time, getaway.

00:27:18.630 --> 00:27:22.170 align:middle line:10%
We all live in different
corners of North America.

00:27:22.170 --> 00:27:25.250 align:middle line:10%
And we were looking for
this place in Florida

00:27:25.250 --> 00:27:26.580 align:middle line:10%
that we really wanted to go.

00:27:26.580 --> 00:27:27.980 align:middle line:10%
We were all exhausted.

00:27:27.980 --> 00:27:31.300 align:middle line:10%
We're still not
over it at the time.

00:27:31.300 --> 00:27:33.860 align:middle line:10%


00:27:33.860 --> 00:27:35.670 align:middle line:10%
Unfortunately, it
was March break.

00:27:35.670 --> 00:27:37.800 align:middle line:10%
We couldn't find anywhere.

00:27:37.800 --> 00:27:39.050 align:middle line:10%
Everything was taken.

00:27:39.050 --> 00:27:41.450 align:middle line:10%
Of course, we just wanted
to be in some comfort,

00:27:41.450 --> 00:27:43.110 align:middle line:10%
and we wanted to
be on the beach.

00:27:43.110 --> 00:27:44.400 align:middle line:10%
We couldn't find anything.

00:27:44.400 --> 00:27:46.700 align:middle line:10%
I was exhaustively
searching for days.

00:27:46.700 --> 00:27:48.210 align:middle line:10%
I go and have a nap.

00:27:48.210 --> 00:27:49.050 align:middle line:10%
I have this dream.

00:27:49.050 --> 00:27:52.970 align:middle line:10%
I'm looking at my computer,
and it says "Treasure Island"

00:27:52.970 --> 00:27:54.980 align:middle line:10%
on my computer screen.

00:27:54.980 --> 00:27:56.760 align:middle line:90%
Nothing else happened in it.

00:27:56.760 --> 00:27:57.800 align:middle line:90%
I wake up.

00:27:57.800 --> 00:27:59.910 align:middle line:90%
I go do a search.

00:27:59.910 --> 00:28:01.220 align:middle line:90%
I've never heard of this.

00:28:01.220 --> 00:28:02.840 align:middle line:90%
Treasure Island?

00:28:02.840 --> 00:28:04.820 align:middle line:90%
I found one place.

00:28:04.820 --> 00:28:05.630 align:middle line:90%
Perfect.

00:28:05.630 --> 00:28:07.380 align:middle line:90%
Three-bedroom, on the beach.

00:28:07.380 --> 00:28:09.060 align:middle line:84%
We actually went
and stayed there.

00:28:09.060 --> 00:28:11.060 align:middle line:90%
So what's that all about?

00:28:11.060 --> 00:28:13.110 align:middle line:10%
Who's looking out for us?

00:28:13.110 --> 00:28:14.450 align:middle line:10%
What is going on?

00:28:14.450 --> 00:28:17.330 align:middle line:10%
A lot of us believe
in guides and guidance

00:28:17.330 --> 00:28:19.040 align:middle line:10%
and God and different things.

00:28:19.040 --> 00:28:21.180 align:middle line:90%
But I'm not going there.

00:28:21.180 --> 00:28:22.730 align:middle line:90%
I'm bringing it back to us.

00:28:22.730 --> 00:28:28.310 align:middle line:84%
What part of us is
involved in this?

00:28:28.310 --> 00:28:31.610 align:middle line:10%
Greater part of ourselves that's
guiding us, protecting us,

00:28:31.610 --> 00:28:33.440 align:middle line:10%
giving me Treasure Island?

00:28:33.440 --> 00:28:34.710 align:middle line:10%
I don't know.

00:28:34.710 --> 00:28:36.220 align:middle line:90%
Or is it me?

00:28:36.220 --> 00:28:37.020 align:middle line:90%
Is it a part of me?

00:28:37.020 --> 00:28:40.440 align:middle line:84%
Is it a part of us that's
even more simple than that?

00:28:40.440 --> 00:28:42.890 align:middle line:10%
But it's important
to capture these

00:28:42.890 --> 00:28:47.680 align:middle line:10%
for your proof of
how amazing you are.

00:28:47.680 --> 00:28:54.000 align:middle line:90%
