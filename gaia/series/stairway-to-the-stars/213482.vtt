00:00:04.491 --> 00:00:07.485 align:middle line:90%
[AUDIO LOGO]

00:00:07.485 --> 00:00:11.990 align:middle line:90%


00:00:11.990 --> 00:00:15.290 align:middle line:10%
>> So now we'll go
into the Solar Trinity,

00:00:15.290 --> 00:00:17.260 align:middle line:10%
death of Osiris
and birth of Horus.

00:00:17.260 --> 00:00:19.920 align:middle line:90%


00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:23.260 align:middle line:84%
And how many of you
know this story?

00:00:23.260 --> 00:00:27.180 align:middle line:84%
OK, the shorthand
version of it-- because I

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:28.930 align:middle line:84%
don't have a lot of
time to get into this.

00:00:28.930 --> 00:00:33.220 align:middle line:10%
But basically, Set kills
Osiris, his brother.

00:00:33.220 --> 00:00:36.070 align:middle line:10%
And one of the story-- there's
many, many stories of this.

00:00:36.070 --> 00:00:37.660 align:middle line:10%
But one of the
stories that I like

00:00:37.660 --> 00:00:48.800 align:middle line:10%
is he learned that Osiris and
Nephthys had sex, creating

00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:51.730 align:middle line:10%
Anubis, the god of the dead.

00:00:51.730 --> 00:00:55.390 align:middle line:84%
So Osiris and Nephthys
conceive Anubis

00:00:55.390 --> 00:00:58.720 align:middle line:84%
on the summer solstice
nine months to birth

00:00:58.720 --> 00:01:00.700 align:middle line:90%
at spring solstice.

00:01:00.700 --> 00:01:03.610 align:middle line:84%
And I'm just saying
this out loud

00:01:03.610 --> 00:01:05.770 align:middle line:84%
because I'll get into it
later, but Scorpius rises

00:01:05.770 --> 00:01:09.060 align:middle line:84%
in the east around
summer solstice

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:12.700 align:middle line:84%
then rises to its highest
declination around mid-July.

00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:16.360 align:middle line:84%
Set rules heaven after
the death of Osiris.

00:01:16.360 --> 00:01:19.860 align:middle line:84%
OK, so Set disposes his
body into the waters,

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:23.530 align:middle line:84%
scattering his cut-up
remains around Egypt.

00:01:23.530 --> 00:01:27.606 align:middle line:84%
Isis and Nephthys mourn
and search for the remains.

00:01:27.606 --> 00:01:30.840 align:middle line:84%
Isis's tears fill
the Nile with water.

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:34.380 align:middle line:84%
The Nile is inundated during
that time of the winter

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:35.730 align:middle line:90%
solstice.

00:01:35.730 --> 00:01:39.180 align:middle line:84%
So all these stories
are related to what is

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:42.000 align:middle line:90%
happening on earth at the time.

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:46.380 align:middle line:84%
And cutting the body
of Osiris in 14 pieces,

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:49.150 align:middle line:84%
well, it's an allegory of
the phases of the moon.

00:01:49.150 --> 00:01:51.570 align:middle line:84%
After a full moon is
illuminated by the sun,

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:56.370 align:middle line:84%
it takes 14 days until
darkness Set kills the moon.

00:01:56.370 --> 00:01:59.910 align:middle line:10%
Isis then gathers the
14 pieces and restores

00:01:59.910 --> 00:02:03.090 align:middle line:10%
the body back into
full moon glory, which

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:06.960 align:middle line:10%
takes an additional 14 days.

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:09.220 align:middle line:90%
The rise and fall of Orion--

00:02:09.220 --> 00:02:10.449 align:middle line:90%
and this is a great picture.

00:02:10.449 --> 00:02:14.370 align:middle line:84%
This is actually
Ophiuchus standing on--

00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:16.620 align:middle line:84%
Ophiuchus is the
serpent bearer standing

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:19.840 align:middle line:84%
on top of the scorpion, which
I'll get into a little later.

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:25.530 align:middle line:84%
But Osiris, Sah, is also known
as the constellation Orion, who

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:29.560 align:middle line:84%
rules the underworld during the
winter months of the night sky.

00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:33.540 align:middle line:84%
And the brightest star is
Rigel, which is a blue star.

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:36.160 align:middle line:84%
All right, so now we're
getting into colors.

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:39.480 align:middle line:84%
Horus is the
constellation Ophiuchus

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:42.630 align:middle line:84%
who rules the upper world
after defeating Set,

00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:46.030 align:middle line:84%
rising during the summer
months in the night sky.

00:02:46.030 --> 00:02:49.430 align:middle line:84%
And Antares, which is in
Scorpio, is the red star.

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:52.350 align:middle line:84%
OK, so you have a red
star and a blue star.

00:02:52.350 --> 00:02:58.440 align:middle line:10%
Think about politics, red, blue,
life, death, Bloods, Crips.

00:02:58.440 --> 00:03:04.340 align:middle line:10%
Like these are very
ancient symbolisms in use

00:03:04.340 --> 00:03:07.610 align:middle line:10%
because it comes from the stars.

00:03:07.610 --> 00:03:10.640 align:middle line:90%
Now, this is a great story.

00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:15.650 align:middle line:84%
Orion, the great hunter,
seeks to hunt and kill

00:03:15.650 --> 00:03:16.860 align:middle line:90%
all the animals on earth.

00:03:16.860 --> 00:03:18.690 align:middle line:90%
This is a very ancient story.

00:03:18.690 --> 00:03:22.490 align:middle line:84%
OK, this goes back thousands
and thousands of years.

00:03:22.490 --> 00:03:24.650 align:middle line:84%
In a desperate
attempt to stop Orion

00:03:24.650 --> 00:03:29.240 align:middle line:84%
from harming life on earth, the
goddess Gaia seeks out to help--

00:03:29.240 --> 00:03:32.030 align:middle line:84%
seeks out the help
of a deadly scorpion.

00:03:32.030 --> 00:03:34.100 align:middle line:84%
The scorpion takes
on the challenge

00:03:34.100 --> 00:03:38.330 align:middle line:84%
and sets out on his journey to
hunt the great hunter Orion.

00:03:38.330 --> 00:03:42.860 align:middle line:84%
When Orion is finally found,
the scorpion stings Orion.

00:03:42.860 --> 00:03:48.740 align:middle line:84%
And his poisonous tail kills
him, thus saving life on earth.

00:03:48.740 --> 00:03:51.700 align:middle line:10%
This is really important stuff.

00:03:51.700 --> 00:03:55.000 align:middle line:10%
In gratitude, Gaia
immortalizes the scorpion

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:57.740 align:middle line:10%
as the constellation Scorpius.

00:03:57.740 --> 00:04:02.500 align:middle line:84%
Scorpius is placed directly
opposite Orion in the night sky,

00:04:02.500 --> 00:04:06.200 align:middle line:84%
eternally chasing Orion
through the heavens.

00:04:06.200 --> 00:04:10.190 align:middle line:84%
Aesculapius don't-- I know
I have a bad pronunciation

00:04:10.190 --> 00:04:11.200 align:middle line:90%
of these words--

00:04:11.200 --> 00:04:15.620 align:middle line:84%
the god of medicine and also the
asterism of the constellation

00:04:15.620 --> 00:04:21.290 align:middle line:84%
Ophiuchus, goes against god's
wishes and takes it upon himself

00:04:21.290 --> 00:04:25.340 align:middle line:84%
to heal Orion with the
magical medicine he learned

00:04:25.340 --> 00:04:28.820 align:middle line:84%
from the serpent, the
constellation Serpens,

00:04:28.820 --> 00:04:31.880 align:middle line:90%
resurrecting Orion back to life.

00:04:31.880 --> 00:04:34.970 align:middle line:10%
This scene is also
immortalized in the stars

00:04:34.970 --> 00:04:38.480 align:middle line:10%
as the constellation
Ophiuchus stands directly

00:04:38.480 --> 00:04:40.730 align:middle line:10%
on top of the scorpion
in the night sky,

00:04:40.730 --> 00:04:44.000 align:middle line:10%
protecting and saving
Orion from the deadly sting

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:46.450 align:middle line:10%
of the scorpion.

00:04:46.450 --> 00:04:51.890 align:middle line:84%
Aesculapius also carries
the symbol of the caduceus.

00:04:51.890 --> 00:04:55.360 align:middle line:84%
So the caduceus of healing
comes from this constellation

00:04:55.360 --> 00:04:58.990 align:middle line:84%
Ophiuchus, which is the
magical staff of medicine,

00:04:58.990 --> 00:05:01.340 align:middle line:84%
the serpent coiled,
rising up the staff.

00:05:01.340 --> 00:05:03.070 align:middle line:84%
And we also have
the same imagery

00:05:03.070 --> 00:05:06.137 align:middle line:84%
in polar themes relating
to being saved by poison.

00:05:06.137 --> 00:05:08.470 align:middle line:10%
Now, I just want you to think
about this because I know,

00:05:08.470 --> 00:05:10.178 align:middle line:10%
like, Graham Hancock
and all these people

00:05:10.178 --> 00:05:15.850 align:middle line:10%
talk about something coming
to earth, hitting the earth,

00:05:15.850 --> 00:05:19.690 align:middle line:10%
and killing everything, and then
rebuilding from this, right?

00:05:19.690 --> 00:05:21.140 align:middle line:10%
Ancient civilization ended.

00:05:21.140 --> 00:05:23.770 align:middle line:10%
And now we're starting--
and we don't remember.

00:05:23.770 --> 00:05:25.640 align:middle line:10%
But we do remember.

00:05:25.640 --> 00:05:30.730 align:middle line:10%
This is the story of the
death of our planet, OK?

00:05:30.730 --> 00:05:32.055 align:middle line:10%
Because think about this.

00:05:32.055 --> 00:05:34.760 align:middle line:10%


00:05:34.760 --> 00:05:38.390 align:middle line:10%
Orion is the great
hunter, is shooting

00:05:38.390 --> 00:05:42.225 align:middle line:10%
the bows and arrows, right?

00:05:42.225 --> 00:05:48.260 align:middle line:10%
The Orionids meteor shower
happens between October 7,

00:05:48.260 --> 00:05:51.300 align:middle line:10%
peaking around October 21.

00:05:51.300 --> 00:05:55.880 align:middle line:10%
The sun enters Scorpio
October 23 to November 21,

00:05:55.880 --> 00:05:58.080 align:middle line:10%
signaling the end of
the meteor shower.

00:05:58.080 --> 00:05:59.080 align:middle line:10%
So think about it.

00:05:59.080 --> 00:06:00.710 align:middle line:10%
You're an ancient person.

00:06:00.710 --> 00:06:06.630 align:middle line:10%
You look up into the sky at this
time and see Orion in the sky.

00:06:06.630 --> 00:06:09.840 align:middle line:10%
And the night sky is
filled with meteor showers.

00:06:09.840 --> 00:06:14.160 align:middle line:10%
They look like arrows
being shot from space.

00:06:14.160 --> 00:06:16.560 align:middle line:10%
And then when the
scorpion comes in the sky,

00:06:16.560 --> 00:06:19.800 align:middle line:10%
the constellation Scorpio--

00:06:19.800 --> 00:06:21.450 align:middle line:10%
it ends.

00:06:21.450 --> 00:06:25.130 align:middle line:10%
The earth is saved again.

00:06:25.130 --> 00:06:27.140 align:middle line:10%
Is this making sense?

00:06:27.140 --> 00:06:30.740 align:middle line:10%
So in one time in history,
our ancient people

00:06:30.740 --> 00:06:35.750 align:middle line:10%
looked up in the sky at Orion
and saw all these meteors

00:06:35.750 --> 00:06:37.350 align:middle line:10%
falling down to earth.

00:06:37.350 --> 00:06:42.230 align:middle line:10%
And one of those meteors,
like, hit the planet.

00:06:42.230 --> 00:06:46.510 align:middle line:10%
And that is recorded in these
myths of this astrotheology.

00:06:46.510 --> 00:06:49.730 align:middle line:10%
But no one is-- no one's
put this together yet.

00:06:49.730 --> 00:06:52.730 align:middle line:10%
It's right there for us to see.

00:06:52.730 --> 00:06:56.250 align:middle line:10%
So Horus, the savior motif--

00:06:56.250 --> 00:06:58.150 align:middle line:10%
so here's Horus.

00:06:58.150 --> 00:07:02.380 align:middle line:10%
And it's a very
interesting image.

00:07:02.380 --> 00:07:04.160 align:middle line:10%
Now, this is called
Horus the Savior.

00:07:04.160 --> 00:07:05.980 align:middle line:10%
The reason this is
called Horus the Savior

00:07:05.980 --> 00:07:09.820 align:middle line:10%
is that this was a very popular
theme in New Kingdom in Egypt.

00:07:09.820 --> 00:07:11.920 align:middle line:10%
And they would make this image.

00:07:11.920 --> 00:07:13.900 align:middle line:10%
There's thousands
of these images.

00:07:13.900 --> 00:07:17.080 align:middle line:10%
And they would put them in
the houses of the Egyptians

00:07:17.080 --> 00:07:20.530 align:middle line:10%
because they said, if you
were stung by a scorpion,

00:07:20.530 --> 00:07:22.780 align:middle line:10%
or if you were bitten
by a poisonous snake,

00:07:22.780 --> 00:07:27.440 align:middle line:10%
all you had to do was
look up at this image,

00:07:27.440 --> 00:07:31.920 align:middle line:10%
and it would cure you of
the poison, all right?

00:07:31.920 --> 00:07:33.720 align:middle line:10%
That was the whole idea of this.

00:07:33.720 --> 00:07:35.450 align:middle line:10%
That was the magic of this.

00:07:35.450 --> 00:07:39.530 align:middle line:10%
But if you know astrology,
this is also the same image

00:07:39.530 --> 00:07:41.130 align:middle line:10%
of the serpent bearer.

00:07:41.130 --> 00:07:43.010 align:middle line:10%
You could see Horus
is standing there

00:07:43.010 --> 00:07:45.920 align:middle line:10%
with two snakes in his hands.

00:07:45.920 --> 00:07:51.130 align:middle line:10%
And so you can see this
is Ophiuchus and Serpens.

00:07:51.130 --> 00:07:54.280 align:middle line:10%
Serpens is the serpent that
wraps around Ophiuchus.

00:07:54.280 --> 00:07:55.400 align:middle line:10%
And that is Horus.

00:07:55.400 --> 00:07:57.430 align:middle line:10%
It's an asterism of Horus.

00:07:57.430 --> 00:08:00.370 align:middle line:10%
But there's so much
more to this image.

00:08:00.370 --> 00:08:06.440 align:middle line:10%
In his hands, he's holding an
oryx, scorpion, and a lion.

00:08:06.440 --> 00:08:09.800 align:middle line:10%
And he's standing
on crocodiles, OK?

00:08:09.800 --> 00:08:14.180 align:middle line:10%
This is exactly the same as
the four beasts, the four

00:08:14.180 --> 00:08:16.340 align:middle line:10%
angels of the
cardinal directions

00:08:16.340 --> 00:08:19.450 align:middle line:10%
that we see in the Bible.

00:08:19.450 --> 00:08:22.390 align:middle line:10%
It's the same animals.

00:08:22.390 --> 00:08:27.040 align:middle line:10%
So if you put the geometry
over the image, 23.5 geometry,

00:08:27.040 --> 00:08:29.570 align:middle line:10%
it goes right through the hands.

00:08:29.570 --> 00:08:34.010 align:middle line:10%
And it's actually showing you
Scorpius, Taurus, Aquarius, Leo,

00:08:34.010 --> 00:08:40.030 align:middle line:10%
Ophiuchus, and the pole star.

00:08:40.030 --> 00:08:42.460 align:middle line:10%
So this is a map of the heavens.

00:08:42.460 --> 00:08:45.830 align:middle line:10%
Just as Jesus was the
map of the heavens,

00:08:45.830 --> 00:08:48.120 align:middle line:10%
Horus was the map of
the heavens before him.

00:08:48.120 --> 00:08:51.090 align:middle line:90%


00:08:51.090 --> 00:08:52.360 align:middle line:90%
This is what we're looking at.

00:08:52.360 --> 00:08:54.490 align:middle line:10%
You can see the
cardinal directions.

00:08:54.490 --> 00:08:56.610 align:middle line:10%
You have Taurus, the bull.

00:08:56.610 --> 00:08:59.140 align:middle line:90%
Directly under him is Scorpio.

00:08:59.140 --> 00:09:01.300 align:middle line:90%
You have Leo on the other side.

00:09:01.300 --> 00:09:08.600 align:middle line:10%
And directly across is Aquarius,
the boy, the naked boy,

00:09:08.600 --> 00:09:12.150 align:middle line:10%
Aquarius, Horus.

00:09:12.150 --> 00:09:16.530 align:middle line:84%
It creates the
cross of the Zodiac.

00:09:16.530 --> 00:09:20.070 align:middle line:10%
Everything is symbolism.

00:09:20.070 --> 00:09:24.810 align:middle line:10%
So let's take a
closer look at Horus.

00:09:24.810 --> 00:09:28.750 align:middle line:10%
He has this-- he has this
braided thing around his head

00:09:28.750 --> 00:09:30.570 align:middle line:10%
you see on all the children.

00:09:30.570 --> 00:09:31.750 align:middle line:10%
What is this?

00:09:31.750 --> 00:09:33.660 align:middle line:10%
Well, it tells you what it is.

00:09:33.660 --> 00:09:36.520 align:middle line:10%
The back of your
head is that of--

00:09:36.520 --> 00:09:38.250 align:middle line:10%
I don't know how
to pronounce that.

00:09:38.250 --> 00:09:42.630 align:middle line:10%
Your braid is that
of the scorpion.

00:09:42.630 --> 00:09:44.520 align:middle line:10%
And if you look
closely at the brain,

00:09:44.520 --> 00:09:47.260 align:middle line:10%
it has these three
stingers on it.

00:09:47.260 --> 00:09:50.550 align:middle line:10%
And if you look at Scorpio,
it has the three stingers,

00:09:50.550 --> 00:09:53.560 align:middle line:10%
these three lines.

00:09:53.560 --> 00:09:59.680 align:middle line:10%
They're telling you that this is
the sun moving through Scorpius

00:09:59.680 --> 00:10:03.240 align:middle line:10%
is the boy, Horus.

00:10:03.240 --> 00:10:07.010 align:middle line:10%
And so if you look
at this design,

00:10:07.010 --> 00:10:09.830 align:middle line:10%
and if you put the 23.5
degree angle-- like I said,

00:10:09.830 --> 00:10:13.580 align:middle line:10%
that's the secret code is
the 23.5 degree angle--

00:10:13.580 --> 00:10:17.390 align:middle line:10%
it creates the motif
of Horus, but it's also

00:10:17.390 --> 00:10:24.300 align:middle line:10%
the same exact motif used
on Ishtar, exactly the same.

00:10:24.300 --> 00:10:27.540 align:middle line:84%
If you look at Ishtar,
and you just look at her,

00:10:27.540 --> 00:10:31.350 align:middle line:84%
and then if you trace
Ishtar, every single line

00:10:31.350 --> 00:10:34.630 align:middle line:90%
is 23.5 degrees.

00:10:34.630 --> 00:10:38.620 align:middle line:84%
So it wasn't just somebody
doodling a picture.

00:10:38.620 --> 00:10:42.130 align:middle line:84%
They were encoding
a message that

00:10:42.130 --> 00:10:45.590 align:middle line:84%
was only taught to those
that were initiated into it.

00:10:45.590 --> 00:10:49.800 align:middle line:84%
So only priests, those who
understood what they were doing,

00:10:49.800 --> 00:10:50.600 align:middle line:90%
put this in here.

00:10:50.600 --> 00:10:54.400 align:middle line:10%
So I'm showing you something
that's like 4,000 or 5,000 years

00:10:54.400 --> 00:10:56.630 align:middle line:10%
old.

00:10:56.630 --> 00:11:00.510 align:middle line:10%
They knew the tilt of the
earth already back then.

00:11:00.510 --> 00:11:02.060 align:middle line:10%
But if you go to
the history books,

00:11:02.060 --> 00:11:03.860 align:middle line:10%
they tell you that
this was discovered

00:11:03.860 --> 00:11:07.020 align:middle line:10%
maybe a thousand years ago.

00:11:07.020 --> 00:11:11.200 align:middle line:10%
So I'm already disproving
history right here very easily.

00:11:11.200 --> 00:11:14.670 align:middle line:84%
They made it so easy
to disprove history.

00:11:14.670 --> 00:11:19.320 align:middle line:10%
Now, here is the double-headed
snake from Kom Ombo in Egypt.

00:11:19.320 --> 00:11:22.260 align:middle line:10%
And you can see the
double-headed snake.

00:11:22.260 --> 00:11:23.530 align:middle line:10%
It's a very popular motif.

00:11:23.530 --> 00:11:25.350 align:middle line:10%
And if you draw a
line from the center,

00:11:25.350 --> 00:11:28.030 align:middle line:10%
it goes through the
hands at 23.5 degrees.

00:11:28.030 --> 00:11:31.740 align:middle line:10%
The two serpents, the two
snakes looking in the center

00:11:31.740 --> 00:11:33.630 align:middle line:10%
is the division of the equinox.

00:11:33.630 --> 00:11:38.083 align:middle line:84%
And on each side, each snake
represents the solstice.

00:11:38.083 --> 00:11:40.990 align:middle line:90%


00:11:40.990 --> 00:11:45.180 align:middle line:84%
It's exactly the same
in Babylon, all right?

00:11:45.180 --> 00:11:49.296 align:middle line:84%
So these cultures are
hiding the same thing.

00:11:49.296 --> 00:11:51.910 align:middle line:10%
Oh, look, this is a
solar deity from the gate

00:11:51.910 --> 00:11:55.750 align:middle line:10%
of the sun in Bolivia,
goes exactly the same,

00:11:55.750 --> 00:12:00.690 align:middle line:10%
goes through the
hands at 23.5 degrees.

00:12:00.690 --> 00:12:03.010 align:middle line:84%
Now, I'm just doing
a side by side here.

00:12:03.010 --> 00:12:05.020 align:middle line:84%
I'm showing you how
accurate this is.

00:12:05.020 --> 00:12:06.010 align:middle line:90%
Here's Bolivia.

00:12:06.010 --> 00:12:07.860 align:middle line:90%
Here's Egypt.

00:12:07.860 --> 00:12:12.940 align:middle line:84%
It's the exact same geometry
to create this image.

00:12:12.940 --> 00:12:17.410 align:middle line:10%
It's unanimous like exactly
23.5 degrees exactly.

00:12:17.410 --> 00:12:21.850 align:middle line:10%
If it was 24 degrees, 22
degrees, it wouldn't work.

00:12:21.850 --> 00:12:24.940 align:middle line:10%
It was exactly 23.5 degrees.

00:12:24.940 --> 00:12:29.260 align:middle line:84%
So how are cultures from
two sides of the planet

00:12:29.260 --> 00:12:32.010 align:middle line:90%
thousands of years ago--

00:12:32.010 --> 00:12:33.360 align:middle line:90%
drew the same art?

00:12:33.360 --> 00:12:36.120 align:middle line:10%
I know it looks different,
but it's not different.

00:12:36.120 --> 00:12:40.430 align:middle line:10%
It's identical in the
way that it's built.

00:12:40.430 --> 00:12:44.580 align:middle line:10%
We have solar
deity, Sego Canyon,

00:12:44.580 --> 00:12:47.290 align:middle line:10%
got the two serpents there.

00:12:47.290 --> 00:12:51.640 align:middle line:84%
This is from Siberia, 2,000
years old, same thing.

00:12:51.640 --> 00:12:55.150 align:middle line:84%
You have the guy that's
faceless like the sun.

00:12:55.150 --> 00:12:58.400 align:middle line:90%
He's got the two serpents.

00:12:58.400 --> 00:13:01.260 align:middle line:10%
And in fact, that's
not even a face.

00:13:01.260 --> 00:13:03.330 align:middle line:10%
That's the horizon, a mound.

00:13:03.330 --> 00:13:06.380 align:middle line:10%
And the positions of
the sun you're seeing--

00:13:06.380 --> 00:13:07.590 align:middle line:10%
that's not a face.

00:13:07.590 --> 00:13:11.070 align:middle line:10%
And that's at 23.5 degrees.

00:13:11.070 --> 00:13:13.880 align:middle line:10%
And you can see
those, like, circles.

00:13:13.880 --> 00:13:16.190 align:middle line:10%
Under him, the
circle and the dot--

00:13:16.190 --> 00:13:17.910 align:middle line:10%
that's solar symbolism.

00:13:17.910 --> 00:13:21.080 align:middle line:10%
That's very well-known
solar symbolism.

00:13:21.080 --> 00:13:28.010 align:middle line:84%
And the Kukulkan
pyramid in Mexico where

00:13:28.010 --> 00:13:29.600 align:middle line:90%
the shadow of the serpent--

00:13:29.600 --> 00:13:33.740 align:middle line:84%
again, the serpent goes down
the pyramid at the equinox.

00:13:33.740 --> 00:13:39.710 align:middle line:10%
All these cultures are telling
you the exact same thing,

00:13:39.710 --> 00:13:42.830 align:middle line:10%
different cultures
spanned out thousands

00:13:42.830 --> 00:13:45.650 align:middle line:10%
of years, thousands of
miles, but telling you

00:13:45.650 --> 00:13:48.930 align:middle line:10%
exactly the same thing.

00:13:48.930 --> 00:13:52.310 align:middle line:10%
In fact, here's the
Mayan Kan the fourth day,

00:13:52.310 --> 00:13:55.290 align:middle line:10%
comes from the word Kukulkan,
the feathered serpent

00:13:55.290 --> 00:13:57.390 align:middle line:10%
associated with
fertility, abundance,

00:13:57.390 --> 00:14:00.700 align:middle line:10%
the serpent, growing
grains, and the harvest.

00:14:00.700 --> 00:14:02.950 align:middle line:10%
What is that symbol?

00:14:02.950 --> 00:14:05.560 align:middle line:10%
It's the two mounds of
creation with the sun

00:14:05.560 --> 00:14:08.380 align:middle line:10%
in the middle of it.

00:14:08.380 --> 00:14:10.600 align:middle line:84%
OK, it's the exact
same symbolism

00:14:10.600 --> 00:14:14.140 align:middle line:84%
we find on the opposite
side of the world.

00:14:14.140 --> 00:14:16.670 align:middle line:84%
So this is the rediscovering
of the solar code.

00:14:16.670 --> 00:14:18.140 align:middle line:90%
I'm just warming up, by the way.

00:14:18.140 --> 00:14:20.180 align:middle line:84%
I just have to get
you into it, OK?

00:14:20.180 --> 00:14:22.280 align:middle line:90%
I'm just warming up.

00:14:22.280 --> 00:14:24.140 align:middle line:90%
Are you following along so far?

00:14:24.140 --> 00:14:24.260 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:14:24.260 --> 00:14:25.060 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:14:25.060 --> 00:14:26.390 align:middle line:10%
>> OK, thank you.

00:14:26.390 --> 00:14:30.040 align:middle line:10%
Rediscovering the solar code--

00:14:30.040 --> 00:14:32.690 align:middle line:10%
OK, so this is where things
like popped off for me.

00:14:32.690 --> 00:14:36.790 align:middle line:10%
This is where I was like, I
need to write a book on this.

00:14:36.790 --> 00:14:40.600 align:middle line:84%
So this is from the tomb of
in the Valley of the Kings,

00:14:40.600 --> 00:14:44.780 align:middle line:84%
on the wall of the tomb
of Pharaoh Twosret.

00:14:44.780 --> 00:14:49.640 align:middle line:84%
And it shows in the
same body Horus and Set,

00:14:49.640 --> 00:14:52.732 align:middle line:84%
which is very strange to
have them in the same body.

00:14:52.732 --> 00:14:54.440 align:middle line:84%
And they're holding
the arms, and they're

00:14:54.440 --> 00:14:55.735 align:middle line:90%
standing on a double sphinx.

00:14:55.735 --> 00:14:58.260 align:middle line:90%


00:14:58.260 --> 00:15:00.480 align:middle line:84%
Well, if you put the
lines through their hands,

00:15:00.480 --> 00:15:04.230 align:middle line:84%
again, it gives you
this 23.5 degree angle,

00:15:04.230 --> 00:15:06.010 align:middle line:90%
and it separates them.

00:15:06.010 --> 00:15:12.160 align:middle line:84%
So this is the secret of
the pyramids, by the way.

00:15:12.160 --> 00:15:17.020 align:middle line:84%
If you stand at the Sphinx,
and you're looking at the sun,

00:15:17.020 --> 00:15:21.050 align:middle line:84%
the pyramids become a
calendar of the year.

00:15:21.050 --> 00:15:27.980 align:middle line:84%
So behind Khafre, the sun
will set behind Khafre,

00:15:27.980 --> 00:15:30.860 align:middle line:84%
and it will have an
illusion of the sun standing

00:15:30.860 --> 00:15:32.970 align:middle line:84%
on the back of the
Sphinx on the equinox.

00:15:32.970 --> 00:15:35.400 align:middle line:90%
So the sun stands--

00:15:35.400 --> 00:15:40.070 align:middle line:84%
the sun stands on the back
of the Sphinx on the equinox.

00:15:40.070 --> 00:15:41.570 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:15:41.570 --> 00:15:44.900 align:middle line:84%
And then in the winter solstice,
it sets behind Menkaure.

00:15:44.900 --> 00:15:50.650 align:middle line:84%
Summer solstice-- it sets
between the two mounds, OK?

00:15:50.650 --> 00:15:52.810 align:middle line:84%
Right in between the two
pyramids in the summer

00:15:52.810 --> 00:15:58.140 align:middle line:84%
solstices, the sun sets
between the two mounds.

00:15:58.140 --> 00:16:01.290 align:middle line:84%
And this is-- the
equinox reveals one

00:16:01.290 --> 00:16:04.180 align:middle line:90%
of the secrets of the Sphinx.

00:16:04.180 --> 00:16:07.920 align:middle line:84%
So you can see at the
equinox, sun sits or stands

00:16:07.920 --> 00:16:11.680 align:middle line:90%
on the back of the Sphinx.

00:16:11.680 --> 00:16:16.030 align:middle line:84%
And most people don't know
this, but the Great Pyramid

00:16:16.030 --> 00:16:17.510 align:middle line:90%
is not four sided.

00:16:17.510 --> 00:16:19.160 align:middle line:90%
It's eight sided.

00:16:19.160 --> 00:16:21.480 align:middle line:90%
But it's only off by 1 degree.

00:16:21.480 --> 00:16:23.600 align:middle line:90%
So it's very difficult to see.

00:16:23.600 --> 00:16:26.010 align:middle line:10%
You know when you can see it?

00:16:26.010 --> 00:16:28.880 align:middle line:10%
During the equinox.

00:16:28.880 --> 00:16:33.300 align:middle line:84%
During the equinox, one
face would be a shadow.

00:16:33.300 --> 00:16:36.590 align:middle line:90%
One face will be light.

00:16:36.590 --> 00:16:38.180 align:middle line:90%
One face is Horus.

00:16:38.180 --> 00:16:41.450 align:middle line:84%
One face is Set, the
light and the dark.

00:16:41.450 --> 00:16:44.050 align:middle line:90%
This is all symbolism.

00:16:44.050 --> 00:16:48.010 align:middle line:84%
Standing on the back of the
sphinx, which is actually

00:16:48.010 --> 00:16:51.140 align:middle line:84%
the children of Horus, the
four children of Horus,

00:16:51.140 --> 00:16:53.210 align:middle line:90%
are the four sphinxes.

00:16:53.210 --> 00:16:57.130 align:middle line:10%
And this is the four children
of Horus from the "Book

00:16:57.130 --> 00:16:57.950 align:middle line:10%
of the Dead."

00:16:57.950 --> 00:17:01.910 align:middle line:10%
It talks about how two
of the sons are the legs.

00:17:01.910 --> 00:17:04.569 align:middle line:10%
And so winter and autumn.

00:17:04.569 --> 00:17:08.410 align:middle line:10%
And two of the sons of
Horus are the arms, which

00:17:08.410 --> 00:17:11.510 align:middle line:10%
is spring and summer solstice.

00:17:11.510 --> 00:17:16.410 align:middle line:10%
So we can see that this image
is showing us a timestamp.

00:17:16.410 --> 00:17:18.470 align:middle line:10%
It's showing us that
these are the legs

00:17:18.470 --> 00:17:20.480 align:middle line:10%
of the children of Horus.

00:17:20.480 --> 00:17:24.119 align:middle line:10%
And that is the
time of the year.

00:17:24.119 --> 00:17:30.330 align:middle line:10%
It is the fall, equinox
going into winter equinox.

00:17:30.330 --> 00:17:31.980 align:middle line:10%
This is what this
image is showing us.

00:17:31.980 --> 00:17:34.710 align:middle line:10%
This is the equinox
moving to winter.

00:17:34.710 --> 00:17:37.410 align:middle line:90%
That is what that symbol is.

00:17:37.410 --> 00:17:40.558 align:middle line:84%
And this is the
original symbol of that.

00:17:40.558 --> 00:17:42.350 align:middle line:84%
If you can see, it's
not very good quality,

00:17:42.350 --> 00:17:44.240 align:middle line:84%
but you can see Horus
and Set standing

00:17:44.240 --> 00:17:46.430 align:middle line:84%
on the back of
the double sphinx.

00:17:46.430 --> 00:17:49.730 align:middle line:84%
And on the left,
you have a deity--

00:17:49.730 --> 00:17:52.640 align:middle line:84%
four deities pulling
a rope, right?

00:17:52.640 --> 00:17:53.730 align:middle line:90%
I couldn't fit this in.

00:17:53.730 --> 00:17:58.740 align:middle line:84%
But on the opposite side is also
four deities pulling a rope.

00:17:58.740 --> 00:18:02.310 align:middle line:84%
They're pulling the
sun across the heavens.

00:18:02.310 --> 00:18:03.250 align:middle line:90%
That's what it is.

00:18:03.250 --> 00:18:06.005 align:middle line:84%
They're pulling the suns
through the heavens.

00:18:06.005 --> 00:18:08.660 align:middle line:90%


00:18:08.660 --> 00:18:11.270 align:middle line:10%
It's the same thing from an
ancient Babylonian tablet.

00:18:11.270 --> 00:18:15.120 align:middle line:84%
You have the solar disk, and
it's being held up by this rope.

00:18:15.120 --> 00:18:19.600 align:middle line:84%
See the rope in the
center and the solar disk?

00:18:19.600 --> 00:18:23.920 align:middle line:90%
Here's Shamash from Babylon.

00:18:23.920 --> 00:18:27.180 align:middle line:84%
There is the solar
disk of Shamash.

00:18:27.180 --> 00:18:27.980 align:middle line:90%
Look above.

00:18:27.980 --> 00:18:30.790 align:middle line:84%
There's these two
guys holding ropes,

00:18:30.790 --> 00:18:33.705 align:middle line:84%
and they're pulling
the solar disk,

00:18:33.705 --> 00:18:37.690 align:middle line:90%
OK, so ropes pulling the sun.

00:18:37.690 --> 00:18:41.400 align:middle line:84%
Just for fun, I just
want to show you, OK?

00:18:41.400 --> 00:18:42.200 align:middle line:90%
See his rod?

00:18:42.200 --> 00:18:43.580 align:middle line:90%
See the ropes?

00:18:43.580 --> 00:18:46.240 align:middle line:90%
See the pillar?

00:18:46.240 --> 00:18:49.250 align:middle line:90%
23.5 degrees, OK?

00:18:49.250 --> 00:18:50.670 align:middle line:90%
He's the God Shamash.

00:18:50.670 --> 00:18:52.650 align:middle line:90%
He's the sun, the sun.

00:18:52.650 --> 00:18:54.250 align:middle line:90%
It's the sun.

00:18:54.250 --> 00:18:57.110 align:middle line:84%
And they're showing you-- and
you even see that it goes up.

00:18:57.110 --> 00:19:00.190 align:middle line:84%
See the three symbols
next above Shamash?

00:19:00.190 --> 00:19:02.030 align:middle line:84%
He's showing you what
time of year it is.

00:19:02.030 --> 00:19:03.980 align:middle line:90%
This is like a calendar.

00:19:03.980 --> 00:19:05.600 align:middle line:90%
So here's the sun.

00:19:05.600 --> 00:19:06.960 align:middle line:90%
And you have the three serpents.

00:19:06.960 --> 00:19:07.760 align:middle line:90%
It's the rope.

00:19:07.760 --> 00:19:10.080 align:middle line:84%
He's being pulled
through the heavens.

00:19:10.080 --> 00:19:13.260 align:middle line:84%
The sun is being pulled
through the heavens.

00:19:13.260 --> 00:19:18.690 align:middle line:10%
Again, everything is
aligned to 23.5 degrees.

00:19:18.690 --> 00:19:23.640 align:middle line:10%
In India, there's Samudra
Manthana, the churning

00:19:23.640 --> 00:19:25.080 align:middle line:10%
of the great ocean.

00:19:25.080 --> 00:19:27.370 align:middle line:10%
It's the same imagery.

00:19:27.370 --> 00:19:30.280 align:middle line:10%
It's this-- they're
pulling the snake.

00:19:30.280 --> 00:19:35.480 align:middle line:10%
They're pulling the solar
deity across the heavens.

00:19:35.480 --> 00:19:37.950 align:middle line:10%
Churning the great milk ocean--

00:19:37.950 --> 00:19:43.060 align:middle line:10%
I wonder what that really
means, so Milky Way.

00:19:43.060 --> 00:19:44.830 align:middle line:10%
So these cultures
knew about this,

00:19:44.830 --> 00:19:46.780 align:middle line:10%
but they wrote about
it in their myths

00:19:46.780 --> 00:19:51.370 align:middle line:10%
and made pictures, symbolism
to describe what is happening

00:19:51.370 --> 00:19:54.420 align:middle line:10%
on earth and in heavens.

00:19:54.420 --> 00:19:56.610 align:middle line:10%
So again, this is another
image from the tomb,

00:19:56.610 --> 00:19:59.850 align:middle line:10%
and it shows Horus, and Set,
and the three serpents just

00:19:59.850 --> 00:20:01.840 align:middle line:10%
like in India.

00:20:01.840 --> 00:20:06.040 align:middle line:84%
It's the pulling of the
serpents through time.

00:20:06.040 --> 00:20:08.170 align:middle line:10%
And again, so it's
like the path of Set

00:20:08.170 --> 00:20:11.370 align:middle line:10%
going into winter
solstice, path of Horus

00:20:11.370 --> 00:20:14.010 align:middle line:10%
going into summer solstice.

00:20:14.010 --> 00:20:15.700 align:middle line:90%
And this is what it looks like.

00:20:15.700 --> 00:20:17.160 align:middle line:90%
It's the stepping up.

00:20:17.160 --> 00:20:20.400 align:middle line:84%
The sun in the horizon goes
from winter solstice, equinox

00:20:20.400 --> 00:20:21.230 align:middle line:90%
to summer solstice.

00:20:21.230 --> 00:20:23.250 align:middle line:90%
It's these three steps.

00:20:23.250 --> 00:20:26.370 align:middle line:84%
Again, this is symbolism,
the three steps of the sun,

00:20:26.370 --> 00:20:28.260 align:middle line:90%
three steps of the sun.

00:20:28.260 --> 00:20:30.810 align:middle line:10%
And this is a
famous brick pattern

00:20:30.810 --> 00:20:35.040 align:middle line:10%
all through Peru and
South America, Mexico.

00:20:35.040 --> 00:20:38.100 align:middle line:10%
And I took this off
a pyramid in Nazca.

00:20:38.100 --> 00:20:40.530 align:middle line:10%
And I just wanted to measure
it, and all the steps

00:20:40.530 --> 00:20:42.960 align:middle line:10%
were 23.5 degrees.

00:20:42.960 --> 00:20:45.750 align:middle line:10%
That's how they
made those steps.

00:20:45.750 --> 00:20:48.430 align:middle line:10%
OK, so now I'm rediscovering
the solar ratio.

00:20:48.430 --> 00:20:51.960 align:middle line:10%
So this is-- we've learned about
the solar angles or the earth

00:20:51.960 --> 00:20:53.890 align:middle line:10%
angles at 22.5 degrees.

00:20:53.890 --> 00:20:55.740 align:middle line:10%
Now, I'm going to get
into the solar ratios.

00:20:55.740 --> 00:20:59.130 align:middle line:84%
Now, it's going
to get really fun.

00:20:59.130 --> 00:21:03.660 align:middle line:84%
So like I showed you, this is
the 23.5 degrees, the earth.

00:21:03.660 --> 00:21:05.380 align:middle line:90%
And this is what it looks like.

00:21:05.380 --> 00:21:08.380 align:middle line:90%
So this is the path of the sun.

00:21:08.380 --> 00:21:10.810 align:middle line:84%
This is actually
over Palm Springs.

00:21:10.810 --> 00:21:14.742 align:middle line:84%
And so this is the sun at noon
at the winter solstice, OK?

00:21:14.742 --> 00:21:19.270 align:middle line:84%
The sun moves to the
center at the equinox.

00:21:19.270 --> 00:21:22.950 align:middle line:84%
And at summer solstice, it's at
the highest point in the sky.

00:21:22.950 --> 00:21:26.620 align:middle line:90%
So it's these three steps.

00:21:26.620 --> 00:21:28.960 align:middle line:90%
See the three steps?

00:21:28.960 --> 00:21:31.790 align:middle line:90%
And that's Shamash or Marduk.

00:21:31.790 --> 00:21:37.830 align:middle line:84%
It's the three steps of
the sun, all symbolism.

00:21:37.830 --> 00:21:40.240 align:middle line:10%
Even in petroglyphs in Utah--

00:21:40.240 --> 00:21:42.630 align:middle line:10%
now, you have these three suns.

00:21:42.630 --> 00:21:47.760 align:middle line:10%
And I typed in the latitude,
and I got the path of the sun

00:21:47.760 --> 00:21:49.690 align:middle line:10%
at this location.

00:21:49.690 --> 00:21:52.800 align:middle line:10%
And then I overlaid it
right on the petroglyph,

00:21:52.800 --> 00:21:56.100 align:middle line:10%
and it actually lined
up 100% accurately.

00:21:56.100 --> 00:22:00.270 align:middle line:10%
So they were actually
marking the sun's position

00:22:00.270 --> 00:22:01.800 align:middle line:10%
in the petroglyphs.

00:22:01.800 --> 00:22:03.900 align:middle line:10%
And you can see the
different petroglyphs

00:22:03.900 --> 00:22:05.920 align:middle line:10%
for the different
times of the year.

00:22:05.920 --> 00:22:08.350 align:middle line:10%
So that's what the sun looks
like in winter solstice.

00:22:08.350 --> 00:22:10.390 align:middle line:10%
That's what the sun
looks like in equinox.

00:22:10.390 --> 00:22:13.010 align:middle line:10%
And that's the petroglyph
to mean summer solstice.

00:22:13.010 --> 00:22:16.320 align:middle line:90%


00:22:16.320 --> 00:22:19.230 align:middle line:84%
And a gentleman
brought me an artifact

00:22:19.230 --> 00:22:20.870 align:middle line:84%
to show me at contact
in the desert.

00:22:20.870 --> 00:22:23.250 align:middle line:84%
This is without-- he
doesn't even know how old.

00:22:23.250 --> 00:22:26.670 align:middle line:84%
He was guessing 2,000, 3,000
years old artifact found

00:22:26.670 --> 00:22:28.830 align:middle line:90%
in Florida, OK?

00:22:28.830 --> 00:22:32.100 align:middle line:84%
So there's native American
artifact found in Florida.

00:22:32.100 --> 00:22:34.750 align:middle line:84%
Look at the symbol
on it, all right?

00:22:34.750 --> 00:22:37.840 align:middle line:84%
You have the sun
symbol just like this.

00:22:37.840 --> 00:22:40.330 align:middle line:84%
This is the sun symbol
would be the equinox.

00:22:40.330 --> 00:22:41.830 align:middle line:84%
And then look what
you have here.

00:22:41.830 --> 00:22:49.600 align:middle line:84%
You have a 23.5 degree line and
a 45 degree line, all right?

00:22:49.600 --> 00:22:52.190 align:middle line:10%
On the back of it is
even more interesting.

00:22:52.190 --> 00:22:54.760 align:middle line:10%
It's the constellation Vela.

00:22:54.760 --> 00:22:58.460 align:middle line:10%
Why is the constellation
Vela so interesting?

00:22:58.460 --> 00:23:03.260 align:middle line:10%
Is because Vela is actually part
of the constellation Argo, which

00:23:03.260 --> 00:23:05.060 align:middle line:10%
is the mythical ship of Jason--

00:23:05.060 --> 00:23:07.100 align:middle line:10%
not me, the other Jason--

00:23:07.100 --> 00:23:10.520 align:middle line:10%
and the Argonauts, who sailed
to retrieve the Golden Fleece.

00:23:10.520 --> 00:23:14.990 align:middle line:10%
And Vela is most visible
during March, spring equinox.

00:23:14.990 --> 00:23:18.770 align:middle line:10%
So they're literally putting
petroglyphs on a stone

00:23:18.770 --> 00:23:20.930 align:middle line:10%
with the constellation
to show you

00:23:20.930 --> 00:23:26.610 align:middle line:10%
that the sun will be in equinox
when Vela is in the sky.

00:23:26.610 --> 00:23:28.095 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:23:28.095 --> 00:23:30.720 align:middle line:84%
All right, now, we're going
to jump back to Egypt.

00:23:30.720 --> 00:23:31.630 align:middle line:90%
I love this image.

00:23:31.630 --> 00:23:33.463 align:middle line:84%
This is from the "Book
of the Dead" as well.

00:23:33.463 --> 00:23:36.660 align:middle line:84%
And this is Mau, which is
a version of Ra the sun

00:23:36.660 --> 00:23:39.300 align:middle line:90%
cutting the serpent Apophis.

00:23:39.300 --> 00:23:43.540 align:middle line:84%
Because Mau is protecting
the tree of life,

00:23:43.540 --> 00:23:45.600 align:middle line:84%
he doesn't want
the serpent to eat

00:23:45.600 --> 00:23:47.890 align:middle line:90%
the apples on the tree of life.

00:23:47.890 --> 00:23:52.435 align:middle line:84%
Where have we heard that
story before, right?

00:23:52.435 --> 00:23:55.780 align:middle line:84%
I'll just describe
this, all right?

00:23:55.780 --> 00:24:00.550 align:middle line:84%
So Mau is cutting
the serpent, right?

00:24:00.550 --> 00:24:02.470 align:middle line:90%
Mau is cutting the serpent.

00:24:02.470 --> 00:24:06.310 align:middle line:84%
If you look into
the sky, the sun

00:24:06.310 --> 00:24:10.540 align:middle line:84%
cuts the Milky Way in
a couple places as it

00:24:10.540 --> 00:24:13.040 align:middle line:90%
travels the year, all right?

00:24:13.040 --> 00:24:14.900 align:middle line:90%
It's cutting the serpent.

00:24:14.900 --> 00:24:17.470 align:middle line:84%
It's cutting the Milky
Way as it passes through.

00:24:17.470 --> 00:24:23.000 align:middle line:84%
You see how Mau is standing
on the head of the serpent?

00:24:23.000 --> 00:24:26.660 align:middle line:84%
The lion is standing on
the head of the serpent.

00:24:26.660 --> 00:24:30.210 align:middle line:84%
If you go to the constellations
and you zoom in on Leo,

00:24:30.210 --> 00:24:34.440 align:middle line:84%
Leo also stands on top
of Hydra, the snake.

00:24:34.440 --> 00:24:38.710 align:middle line:84%
They're showing you what's in
heaven and what's on earth.

00:24:38.710 --> 00:24:41.630 align:middle line:90%


00:24:41.630 --> 00:24:43.910 align:middle line:10%
My question is, if they
knew this in Egypt,

00:24:43.910 --> 00:24:48.040 align:middle line:10%
how did they know this
in Ohio Serpent Mound?

00:24:48.040 --> 00:24:50.100 align:middle line:10%
It's exactly the same thing.

00:24:50.100 --> 00:24:54.040 align:middle line:10%
The sun is cutting through.

00:24:54.040 --> 00:24:58.130 align:middle line:10%
The serpent is the same
symbolism, the same story.

00:24:58.130 --> 00:25:00.910 align:middle line:10%
So the sun will
set at these ridges

00:25:00.910 --> 00:25:02.830 align:middle line:10%
of the curves of the serpent--

00:25:02.830 --> 00:25:04.240 align:middle line:10%
of serpent mound.

00:25:04.240 --> 00:25:07.630 align:middle line:10%
Also in Ontario,
there's a serpent mound,

00:25:07.630 --> 00:25:10.640 align:middle line:10%
and the sun cuts
through that as well.

00:25:10.640 --> 00:25:12.170 align:middle line:84%
And just for fun,
I took a picture

00:25:12.170 --> 00:25:17.340 align:middle line:84%
of the lake near this in Ontario
because I'm from Ontario.

00:25:17.340 --> 00:25:21.600 align:middle line:84%
And I was taking pictures of
the sun bouncing off the lake.

00:25:21.600 --> 00:25:22.690 align:middle line:90%
And check it out.

00:25:22.690 --> 00:25:26.970 align:middle line:10%
It looks like a serpent, right?

00:25:26.970 --> 00:25:30.840 align:middle line:10%
The sun is literally
walking on water.

00:25:30.840 --> 00:25:33.890 align:middle line:90%
[AUDIO LOGO]

00:25:33.890 --> 00:25:37.000 align:middle line:90%
