[THEME MUSIC]

00:00:07.728 --> 00:00:10.626 align:middle line:90%


00:00:10.626 --> 00:00:13.090 align:middle line:10%
>> So I'm telling
you all of this.

00:00:13.090 --> 00:00:17.860 align:middle line:84%
Don't worry, there's
a solution at the end.

00:00:17.860 --> 00:00:21.750 align:middle line:90%
I like to bring up the actual--

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:23.200 align:middle line:90%
what's really happening.

00:00:23.200 --> 00:00:25.020 align:middle line:90%
This is the truth, you see.

00:00:25.020 --> 00:00:30.070 align:middle line:84%
And so that you know
what to do with it.

00:00:30.070 --> 00:00:34.590 align:middle line:84%
And so some people
tell me also, like,

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:38.340 align:middle line:84%
I wish I can see the
subtle energy like you do,

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:39.910 align:middle line:90%
that I could discern.

00:00:39.910 --> 00:00:45.220 align:middle line:10%
And I'll tell you something,
once you see, you cannot unsee.

00:00:45.220 --> 00:00:52.590 align:middle line:84%
And so you start to see
things that are not as nice.

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:55.230 align:middle line:84%
And in the beginning,
when I was just

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:57.180 align:middle line:84%
growing up and
working with people,

00:00:57.180 --> 00:00:58.980 align:middle line:90%
I would see these entities.

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:01.120 align:middle line:84%
And I'm like, did
I make this up?

00:01:01.120 --> 00:01:03.090 align:middle line:90%
Like, is this for real?

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:05.050 align:middle line:90%
I didn't want to look at that.

00:01:05.050 --> 00:01:07.590 align:middle line:84%
I didn't want to
believe that it's

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:11.690 align:middle line:84%
possible for some dark
energy to float in my space.

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:13.370 align:middle line:90%
I just didn't want to go there.

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:16.840 align:middle line:10%
I'm like, no, I know how
to maintain my energy,

00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:18.640 align:middle line:10%
and I know how to keep--

00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:20.930 align:middle line:10%
and everybody
should be the same.

00:01:20.930 --> 00:01:23.030 align:middle line:10%
We should be protected.

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:25.600 align:middle line:84%
You heard about the
whole protection thing.

00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:30.160 align:middle line:84%
And yet, what would
happen is that I

00:01:30.160 --> 00:01:33.550 align:middle line:84%
would see that this
particular energy was

00:01:33.550 --> 00:01:38.020 align:middle line:84%
the root cause of their
cancer or their diabetes

00:01:38.020 --> 00:01:41.300 align:middle line:90%
or their mental illness.

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:44.240 align:middle line:84%
What do you think
schizophrenia is?

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:49.580 align:middle line:84%
When somebody schizophrenic
hears and sees things,

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:50.620 align:middle line:90%
well, guess what?

00:01:50.620 --> 00:01:54.330 align:middle line:84%
They are hearing things, because
there is an entity there.

00:01:54.330 --> 00:01:57.050 align:middle line:84%
So I would work with
a mental patient.

00:01:57.050 --> 00:02:00.210 align:middle line:84%
And then I would see the
entity telling them stuff.

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:03.360 align:middle line:84%
And then when the entity
would go, would take it out,

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:05.630 align:middle line:90%
then the person is clear.

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:07.680 align:middle line:90%
No drugs, you see.

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:12.560 align:middle line:84%
And so that's the reason why
I want to bring up everything

00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:15.620 align:middle line:84%
that's really happening,
this is the truth,

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:23.180 align:middle line:84%
so that we can take charge so
we can master our instrument,

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:28.200 align:middle line:84%
cleanse, discern,
recognize, wait, wait,

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:31.230 align:middle line:84%
there's something here, I don't
know what it is, just go away.

00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:32.310 align:middle line:90%
Makes sense?

00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:34.550 align:middle line:90%
That's the purpose of this--

00:02:34.550 --> 00:02:38.660 align:middle line:84%
for you to become
clear, sensitive enough

00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:43.340 align:middle line:84%
to discern and keep your
instrument strong this way.

00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:48.670 align:middle line:84%
Because on top of this, we don't
realize how our mind works.

00:02:48.670 --> 00:02:56.020 align:middle line:84%
For example, I say, I want
to create a relationship,

00:02:56.020 --> 00:02:57.480 align:middle line:90%
a beautiful relationship.

00:02:57.480 --> 00:03:00.380 align:middle line:84%
That's my conscious
mind is saying that.

00:03:00.380 --> 00:03:04.180 align:middle line:84%
But my subconscious mind
is saying, I don't know.

00:03:04.180 --> 00:03:05.270 align:middle line:90%
Am I ready?

00:03:05.270 --> 00:03:07.400 align:middle line:84%
Then I'm like, I'm
not going to be free.

00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:10.070 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to have to do
stuff with that person.

00:03:10.070 --> 00:03:13.270 align:middle line:90%
Am I going to change my--

00:03:13.270 --> 00:03:14.860 align:middle line:90%
same thing with money.

00:03:14.860 --> 00:03:18.430 align:middle line:84%
My brain is saying, I want
to create money, abundance.

00:03:18.430 --> 00:03:24.250 align:middle line:84%
And my subconscious mind is
saying, money is corrupt.

00:03:24.250 --> 00:03:26.210 align:middle line:84%
I just don't want
to deal with money.

00:03:26.210 --> 00:03:27.220 align:middle line:90%
It's corrupt.

00:03:27.220 --> 00:03:28.850 align:middle line:90%
Or it's very hard to make money.

00:03:28.850 --> 00:03:30.700 align:middle line:84%
Only the elite and
blah, blah, blah.

00:03:30.700 --> 00:03:33.970 align:middle line:84%
So my higher self, my
higher consciousness

00:03:33.970 --> 00:03:37.940 align:middle line:84%
is the one that's guiding
me to create what I want.

00:03:37.940 --> 00:03:42.160 align:middle line:84%
So I'm getting a beautiful
signal telling me, OK, you're

00:03:42.160 --> 00:03:46.400 align:middle line:84%
ready for a relationship or
you're ready for abundance.

00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:49.590 align:middle line:90%
So ask for it, put it out there.

00:03:49.590 --> 00:03:55.150 align:middle line:84%
So what I'm saying is, I
am transferring energy.

00:03:55.150 --> 00:03:58.640 align:middle line:84%
My conscious mind is
transferring energy, saying,

00:03:58.640 --> 00:04:00.580 align:middle line:90%
I want this thing.

00:04:00.580 --> 00:04:04.430 align:middle line:84%
My subconscious mind is
also transferring energy,

00:04:04.430 --> 00:04:08.510 align:middle line:84%
is emitting information saying,
I'm not ready, I can't do it,

00:04:08.510 --> 00:04:10.340 align:middle line:90%
I'm a failure, blah, blah, blah.

00:04:10.340 --> 00:04:12.680 align:middle line:84%
And my higher self is
saying, no, no, no.

00:04:12.680 --> 00:04:15.650 align:middle line:84%
So you see why we
get stuck, and you

00:04:15.650 --> 00:04:17.329 align:middle line:90%
see why we don't go anywhere?

00:04:17.329 --> 00:04:21.360 align:middle line:84%
You see why we are stuck
in the wrong relationships,

00:04:21.360 --> 00:04:24.590 align:middle line:84%
we're still poor or
whatever, we're not abundant,

00:04:24.590 --> 00:04:26.780 align:middle line:84%
we're still sick, and
so on and so forth--

00:04:26.780 --> 00:04:33.310 align:middle line:84%
because we are emitting
energy we're not aware of.

00:04:33.310 --> 00:04:37.990 align:middle line:84%
So all this to say that
we are not just linear.

00:04:37.990 --> 00:04:40.120 align:middle line:90%
We're not one dimensional.

00:04:40.120 --> 00:04:41.800 align:middle line:90%
We are multidimensional.

00:04:41.800 --> 00:04:45.460 align:middle line:84%
You're starting to see that
you are much more complex.

00:04:45.460 --> 00:04:46.970 align:middle line:90%
You are multi-dimensional.

00:04:46.970 --> 00:04:50.800 align:middle line:84%
You are sending and receiving
all kinds of information

00:04:50.800 --> 00:04:52.980 align:middle line:90%
that you're not aware of.

00:04:52.980 --> 00:04:56.820 align:middle line:84%
So sometimes I'm, oh,
I think I'm psychic

00:04:56.820 --> 00:05:00.940 align:middle line:84%
and oh, I feel like
intuition, this, and that.

00:05:00.940 --> 00:05:05.010 align:middle line:90%
And everybody's psychic.

00:05:05.010 --> 00:05:07.060 align:middle line:90%
Everybody is clairvoyant.

00:05:07.060 --> 00:05:10.860 align:middle line:90%
Everybody has this ability.

00:05:10.860 --> 00:05:13.800 align:middle line:84%
I'm just telling you
that because we are not

00:05:13.800 --> 00:05:19.080 align:middle line:84%
taught any of this, we walk
around thinking just one thing.

00:05:19.080 --> 00:05:21.450 align:middle line:84%
And that's how we
get in trouble.

00:05:21.450 --> 00:05:26.220 align:middle line:84%
So now let's talk
about the solutions.

00:05:26.220 --> 00:05:29.380 align:middle line:84%
All right, like, how
to manage all of this.

00:05:29.380 --> 00:05:36.660 align:middle line:84%
And the idea is, again, for
you to bring the information,

00:05:36.660 --> 00:05:40.170 align:middle line:84%
the download that's
relevant to you

00:05:40.170 --> 00:05:43.820 align:middle line:84%
now, that's relevant
to your higher purpose.

00:05:43.820 --> 00:05:46.590 align:middle line:84%
Again, why would
you want to talk

00:05:46.590 --> 00:05:48.850 align:middle line:90%
to the Pleiadian or whoever?

00:05:48.850 --> 00:05:50.830 align:middle line:84%
I have nothing against
the Pleiadians.

00:05:50.830 --> 00:05:56.230 align:middle line:84%
But why would you want
to hang out and listen

00:05:56.230 --> 00:05:59.050 align:middle line:84%
to other messages
that have nothing

00:05:59.050 --> 00:06:03.250 align:middle line:84%
to do with why you're
here, where you're going,

00:06:03.250 --> 00:06:05.840 align:middle line:84%
who you are as a being,
and so on and so forth?

00:06:05.840 --> 00:06:10.270 align:middle line:84%
So we learn to just put
everything to the side,

00:06:10.270 --> 00:06:13.360 align:middle line:84%
recognize, and discern
what is in my field, what

00:06:13.360 --> 00:06:16.870 align:middle line:84%
is in my consciousness,
and bring the one thing--

00:06:16.870 --> 00:06:17.900 align:middle line:90%
think about this.

00:06:17.900 --> 00:06:19.240 align:middle line:90%
You wake up in the morning.

00:06:19.240 --> 00:06:21.790 align:middle line:84%
You do your cleanse
five minutes--

00:06:21.790 --> 00:06:27.670 align:middle line:84%
which we're going to do, by the
way, yay, at the end of my talk.

00:06:27.670 --> 00:06:29.720 align:middle line:90%
So you flush out your system.

00:06:29.720 --> 00:06:30.790 align:middle line:90%
You're clear.

00:06:30.790 --> 00:06:32.570 align:middle line:84%
What is it that I'm
supposed to do today?

00:06:32.570 --> 00:06:34.850 align:middle line:84%
I have a meeting or I
need this or whatever.

00:06:34.850 --> 00:06:37.450 align:middle line:84%
You bring down the
information that's

00:06:37.450 --> 00:06:41.380 align:middle line:84%
100% relevant to where you
are, what you should say,

00:06:41.380 --> 00:06:45.280 align:middle line:84%
what do you need to expect
with this, whatever.

00:06:45.280 --> 00:06:47.980 align:middle line:90%
You prepare your instrument.

00:06:47.980 --> 00:06:49.570 align:middle line:90%
And you set your intention.

00:06:49.570 --> 00:06:50.680 align:middle line:90%
And off you go.

00:06:50.680 --> 00:06:55.070 align:middle line:84%
And you manifest
instantly, you see.

00:06:55.070 --> 00:06:58.940 align:middle line:90%
Because look at this thing.

00:06:58.940 --> 00:07:03.250 align:middle line:84%
When your energy is
disturbed with all

00:07:03.250 --> 00:07:07.750 align:middle line:84%
of this information, emotions
and thoughts and other people's

00:07:07.750 --> 00:07:11.020 align:middle line:84%
stuff and patterns
and all this thing,

00:07:11.020 --> 00:07:14.230 align:middle line:84%
how do you expect
this information

00:07:14.230 --> 00:07:17.560 align:middle line:84%
to come through
you in a pure way?

00:07:17.560 --> 00:07:19.400 align:middle line:90%
How do you discern anything?

00:07:19.400 --> 00:07:21.430 align:middle line:90%
There's too much stuff.

00:07:21.430 --> 00:07:26.580 align:middle line:84%
So it gets filtered through
all this information.

00:07:26.580 --> 00:07:28.100 align:middle line:90%
Does that make sense?

00:07:28.100 --> 00:07:31.280 align:middle line:84%
I was going to say crap,
but you know what I mean.

00:07:31.280 --> 00:07:32.350 align:middle line:90%
Can I say crap?

00:07:32.350 --> 00:07:34.480 align:middle line:90%
OK, OK, I said it.

00:07:34.480 --> 00:07:36.340 align:middle line:90%
You see what I mean?

00:07:36.340 --> 00:07:38.740 align:middle line:84%
And so that's why I
like these visuals,

00:07:38.740 --> 00:07:43.270 align:middle line:84%
because I want you to
start visualizing that this

00:07:43.270 --> 00:07:46.410 align:middle line:90%
is how you want to be.

00:07:46.410 --> 00:07:48.840 align:middle line:84%
All these emotions,
these patterns

00:07:48.840 --> 00:07:53.800 align:middle line:84%
that are not serving you are
clogging your system, you see.

00:07:53.800 --> 00:07:58.950 align:middle line:84%
And I'm talking about this like,
but it's very easy to change it.

00:07:58.950 --> 00:08:00.430 align:middle line:90%
We just don't do it.

00:08:00.430 --> 00:08:02.400 align:middle line:84%
So that's what we're
going to do today.

00:08:02.400 --> 00:08:05.340 align:middle line:84%
All right, so then the
conclusion is what?

00:08:05.340 --> 00:08:10.500 align:middle line:10%
Is that all aspects of our
being are emitting information,

00:08:10.500 --> 00:08:13.920 align:middle line:10%
plus other's energies
are sending information

00:08:13.920 --> 00:08:15.680 align:middle line:10%
at the same time.

00:08:15.680 --> 00:08:17.900 align:middle line:10%
So that's why we need
to learn to discern,

00:08:17.900 --> 00:08:19.060 align:middle line:10%
which we're going to do.

00:08:19.060 --> 00:08:22.370 align:middle line:10%
OK, one more thing, because
this is also kind of important,

00:08:22.370 --> 00:08:25.790 align:middle line:10%
for discernment,
the thoughts, how

00:08:25.790 --> 00:08:30.290 align:middle line:10%
are our thoughts, you know how
you're talking all the time

00:08:30.290 --> 00:08:32.659 align:middle line:10%
in your head, mind
chatter, right?

00:08:32.659 --> 00:08:35.090 align:middle line:84%
Talk, talk, talk,
talk, talk, talk.

00:08:35.090 --> 00:08:36.059 align:middle line:90%
What shall I do?

00:08:36.059 --> 00:08:37.679 align:middle line:90%
Do I need to call my mother?

00:08:37.679 --> 00:08:39.120 align:middle line:90%
Oh, wait, I have to eat first.

00:08:39.120 --> 00:08:40.120 align:middle line:90%
And, oh, my god, I have.

00:08:40.120 --> 00:08:41.850 align:middle line:90%
I forgot to call this person.

00:08:41.850 --> 00:08:44.820 align:middle line:10%
Talk, talk, talk, talk.

00:08:44.820 --> 00:08:47.700 align:middle line:10%
How are you-- you creating
with your thoughts.

00:08:47.700 --> 00:08:51.500 align:middle line:10%
Because your thought is emitting
a signal to the universe

00:08:51.500 --> 00:08:55.160 align:middle line:10%
that then resonates
with other information,

00:08:55.160 --> 00:08:56.490 align:middle line:10%
pool of information.

00:08:56.490 --> 00:08:57.980 align:middle line:10%
And that's how
you create, that's

00:08:57.980 --> 00:09:02.125 align:middle line:10%
how you attract the information
that you're looking for.

00:09:02.125 --> 00:09:05.210 align:middle line:10%
But if you are talking
like mind chatter,

00:09:05.210 --> 00:09:08.090 align:middle line:10%
then the signal is
not going anywhere.

00:09:08.090 --> 00:09:10.280 align:middle line:10%
It's just disrupting the flow.

00:09:10.280 --> 00:09:13.370 align:middle line:10%
It's occupying
your mental space.

00:09:13.370 --> 00:09:15.450 align:middle line:10%
And you're not going anywhere.

00:09:15.450 --> 00:09:17.900 align:middle line:90%
It's absolutely useless.

00:09:17.900 --> 00:09:22.820 align:middle line:84%
So that's the reason why we have
to learn to discern our thoughts

00:09:22.820 --> 00:09:25.130 align:middle line:84%
and, again, do
something about them.

00:09:25.130 --> 00:09:29.363 align:middle line:84%
Discern and organize,
manage, control.

00:09:29.363 --> 00:09:32.600 align:middle line:90%


00:09:32.600 --> 00:09:36.090 align:middle line:10%
So let's talk about the
different types of thoughts.

00:09:36.090 --> 00:09:38.970 align:middle line:10%
Of course, the conscious
thought is the one--

00:09:38.970 --> 00:09:41.190 align:middle line:10%
it feels very loud and clear.

00:09:41.190 --> 00:09:45.470 align:middle line:10%
So I want to have
lunch right now.

00:09:45.470 --> 00:09:48.300 align:middle line:10%
I'm going to have a
salad or whatever.

00:09:48.300 --> 00:09:50.190 align:middle line:10%
And so I'm very clear.

00:09:50.190 --> 00:09:54.750 align:middle line:10%
And it's a loud
voice, basically.

00:09:54.750 --> 00:10:00.050 align:middle line:10%
That's my personal
voice that I hear when

00:10:00.050 --> 00:10:03.290 align:middle line:10%
I emit a conscious thought.

00:10:03.290 --> 00:10:07.320 align:middle line:84%
So these are the ones that we
walk around with all the time.

00:10:07.320 --> 00:10:11.030 align:middle line:10%
But then sometimes, as we are
doing that, every now and then,

00:10:11.030 --> 00:10:16.510 align:middle line:10%
there's this little,
very subtle thought.

00:10:16.510 --> 00:10:21.130 align:middle line:10%
It's still your voice,
but it's very subtle.

00:10:21.130 --> 00:10:24.730 align:middle line:10%
It feels like a whisper almost.

00:10:24.730 --> 00:10:32.530 align:middle line:10%
So as I'm saying, for
example, I want to have lunch.

00:10:32.530 --> 00:10:35.730 align:middle line:10%
And I'm going to go have a
salad, I'm thinking this way.

00:10:35.730 --> 00:10:37.110 align:middle line:10%
And I'm saying that.

00:10:37.110 --> 00:10:41.790 align:middle line:10%
But I get this very subtle
thought, oh, maybe you

00:10:41.790 --> 00:10:45.120 align:middle line:10%
should call your friend
and invite them to lunch

00:10:45.120 --> 00:10:50.040 align:middle line:10%
because they want to talk to you
about a project or something.

00:10:50.040 --> 00:10:52.650 align:middle line:10%
That's the inspiration.

00:10:52.650 --> 00:10:56.550 align:middle line:10%
It's almost like your
own voice in a whisper,

00:10:56.550 --> 00:10:59.440 align:middle line:10%
and that comes from
your higher self.

00:10:59.440 --> 00:11:03.290 align:middle line:84%
And a lot of the times we don't
pay attention, unfortunately.

00:11:03.290 --> 00:11:05.920 align:middle line:84%
So that's why I
want you to start

00:11:05.920 --> 00:11:10.900 align:middle line:84%
noticing these little
thoughts that are yours.

00:11:10.900 --> 00:11:12.730 align:middle line:84%
And also the way
you know that it's

00:11:12.730 --> 00:11:14.650 align:middle line:84%
coming from your
higher self, it's

00:11:14.650 --> 00:11:17.770 align:middle line:84%
because you can't
change them in a way.

00:11:17.770 --> 00:11:21.820 align:middle line:84%
If you have a thought like,
I think I should call--

00:11:21.820 --> 00:11:24.970 align:middle line:84%
you should call this friend
and go to lunch with them

00:11:24.970 --> 00:11:28.220 align:middle line:84%
because they're going to talk to
you about an important project,

00:11:28.220 --> 00:11:31.310 align:middle line:84%
it's like, it wasn't
your decision.

00:11:31.310 --> 00:11:33.370 align:middle line:90%
It's a thought that came--

00:11:33.370 --> 00:11:39.350 align:middle line:84%
even though it's your voice, so
to speak, but it came to you.

00:11:39.350 --> 00:11:40.460 align:middle line:90%
Does that make sense?

00:11:40.460 --> 00:11:42.740 align:middle line:90%
So that is your inspiration.

00:11:42.740 --> 00:11:44.650 align:middle line:84%
Technically, that's
the voice that you

00:11:44.650 --> 00:11:47.060 align:middle line:90%
should be paying attention to.

00:11:47.060 --> 00:11:49.630 align:middle line:10%
It's also like the gut feeling.

00:11:49.630 --> 00:11:52.270 align:middle line:10%
You kind of know what
you're going to do.

00:11:52.270 --> 00:11:54.400 align:middle line:10%
Unfortunately, like
I said earlier,

00:11:54.400 --> 00:11:56.860 align:middle line:10%
with the schizophrenia
and the mental illness,

00:11:56.860 --> 00:12:03.470 align:middle line:10%
sometimes we hear other
entities and other beings.

00:12:03.470 --> 00:12:07.850 align:middle line:84%
Mental illness usually
are individuals

00:12:07.850 --> 00:12:10.100 align:middle line:90%
who are extremely sensitive.

00:12:10.100 --> 00:12:11.890 align:middle line:90%
They're extremely sensitive.

00:12:11.890 --> 00:12:17.330 align:middle line:84%
It's an overload of emotions,
overload of information

00:12:17.330 --> 00:12:19.680 align:middle line:84%
is because they
are so sensitive.

00:12:19.680 --> 00:12:23.300 align:middle line:84%
They really are aware of
all this information being

00:12:23.300 --> 00:12:24.850 align:middle line:90%
transferred back and forth.

00:12:24.850 --> 00:12:27.710 align:middle line:84%
That's how, unfortunately,
they break down--

00:12:27.710 --> 00:12:29.270 align:middle line:90%
because they can't handle it.

00:12:29.270 --> 00:12:30.530 align:middle line:90%
Makes sense?

00:12:30.530 --> 00:12:34.400 align:middle line:84%
And then sometimes-- when
I was a kid, sometimes

00:12:34.400 --> 00:12:38.090 align:middle line:84%
I would do that,
and recently also.

00:12:38.090 --> 00:12:39.990 align:middle line:84%
You hear other
people's thoughts.

00:12:39.990 --> 00:12:42.060 align:middle line:90%
I'm talking like humans.

00:12:42.060 --> 00:12:47.090 align:middle line:84%
So one time, for example,
I was working a long time

00:12:47.090 --> 00:12:51.320 align:middle line:84%
ago at this very big
entertainment company.

00:12:51.320 --> 00:12:55.170 align:middle line:84%
And I had a very
glamorous position.

00:12:55.170 --> 00:12:57.480 align:middle line:90%
I was director of whatever.

00:12:57.480 --> 00:13:02.060 align:middle line:84%
And everybody wanted
my job, because I

00:13:02.060 --> 00:13:07.680 align:middle line:84%
had access to sporting events
and celebrity stuff, whatever.

00:13:07.680 --> 00:13:15.180 align:middle line:84%
And so I would report directly
to the CEO of that company.

00:13:15.180 --> 00:13:18.360 align:middle line:84%
And he got transferred
to somewhere else.

00:13:18.360 --> 00:13:22.230 align:middle line:90%
And another CEO took his place.

00:13:22.230 --> 00:13:29.030 align:middle line:84%
And this new CEO, his division
was being laid off or something.

00:13:29.030 --> 00:13:34.790 align:middle line:84%
And he wanted his buddies
to take my position.

00:13:34.790 --> 00:13:40.130 align:middle line:84%
So he would give me all
these reports to do.

00:13:40.130 --> 00:13:44.660 align:middle line:84%
He would tell me, OK, I need
you to-- like, silly stuff.

00:13:44.660 --> 00:13:48.570 align:middle line:84%
He was basically setting me
up, making it so hard on me.

00:13:48.570 --> 00:13:51.680 align:middle line:84%
And so he would give
me all these deadlines.

00:13:51.680 --> 00:13:54.630 align:middle line:84%
Can you finish this whole
report by Tuesday or something?

00:13:54.630 --> 00:13:58.020 align:middle line:84%
And so in the beginning, I
was like, what's going on?

00:13:58.020 --> 00:14:02.917 align:middle line:84%
I could sense that
he wanted me to go.

00:14:02.917 --> 00:14:04.500 align:middle line:84%
I was like, why does
he want me to go?

00:14:04.500 --> 00:14:08.930 align:middle line:84%
And I realized that his buddy
was looking for a job and all

00:14:08.930 --> 00:14:10.290 align:middle line:90%
that whole stuff.

00:14:10.290 --> 00:14:12.900 align:middle line:90%
So one day I was in his office.

00:14:12.900 --> 00:14:17.520 align:middle line:84%
And he was, again,
telling me, OK, well, I

00:14:17.520 --> 00:14:19.260 align:middle line:84%
have this new project
for you and you

00:14:19.260 --> 00:14:21.850 align:middle line:84%
need to do this or whatever,
totally useless stuff.

00:14:21.850 --> 00:14:23.160 align:middle line:90%
And I looked at--

00:14:23.160 --> 00:14:25.420 align:middle line:84%
I was like, I need to
change this whole thing.

00:14:25.420 --> 00:14:29.550 align:middle line:84%
But anyway, the
story goes, what's

00:14:29.550 --> 00:14:33.960 align:middle line:84%
relevant to this
conversation, he's telling me,

00:14:33.960 --> 00:14:36.450 align:middle line:84%
just finish it by
Friday and then

00:14:36.450 --> 00:14:38.620 align:middle line:84%
you'll be all set and
then this and that.

00:14:38.620 --> 00:14:40.030 align:middle line:90%
So I said, OK, fine.

00:14:40.030 --> 00:14:40.830 align:middle line:90%
So I get up.

00:14:40.830 --> 00:14:42.900 align:middle line:90%
And I walk towards the door.

00:14:42.900 --> 00:14:47.400 align:middle line:84%
And I literally-- literally
heard his voice say,

00:14:47.400 --> 00:14:50.370 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to keep doing
this to you until you quit.

00:14:50.370 --> 00:14:52.540 align:middle line:90%
I mean, it was so loud.

00:14:52.540 --> 00:14:53.760 align:middle line:90%
It was his voice.

00:14:53.760 --> 00:14:55.590 align:middle line:84%
It was so loud that
I turned around.

00:14:55.590 --> 00:14:59.220 align:middle line:84%
And I said, did
you say something?

00:14:59.220 --> 00:15:01.300 align:middle line:90%
it was so clear.

00:15:01.300 --> 00:15:09.300 align:middle line:84%
So anyway, I just thought it was
an interesting kind of example

00:15:09.300 --> 00:15:15.370 align:middle line:84%
of how you can literally hear
the other person's voice.

00:15:15.370 --> 00:15:16.840 align:middle line:90%
It's not your voice.

00:15:16.840 --> 00:15:21.090 align:middle line:84%
This is the other person's
voice loud and clear

00:15:21.090 --> 00:15:23.910 align:middle line:90%
if you can discern and ask.

00:15:23.910 --> 00:15:25.980 align:middle line:90%
Because I wanted an explanation.

00:15:25.980 --> 00:15:27.400 align:middle line:90%
Why is he doing this to me?

00:15:27.400 --> 00:15:29.280 align:middle line:84%
I sensed why he's
doing this to me,

00:15:29.280 --> 00:15:32.350 align:middle line:84%
but I got the message
loud and clear--

00:15:32.350 --> 00:15:36.000 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to keep doing
this to you until you quit.

00:15:36.000 --> 00:15:39.292 align:middle line:84%
I ended up quitting not
because of him, but because I

00:15:39.292 --> 00:15:40.500 align:middle line:90%
moved on to something better.

00:15:40.500 --> 00:15:41.300 align:middle line:90%
Anyway.

00:15:41.300 --> 00:15:43.060 align:middle line:84%
But just-- I thought
it was funny.

00:15:43.060 --> 00:15:46.960 align:middle line:84%
OK, so then-- all
right, so moving on.

00:15:46.960 --> 00:15:49.080 align:middle line:84%
I want to show you a
little bit more of this

00:15:49.080 --> 00:15:50.760 align:middle line:90%
without getting too technical.

00:15:50.760 --> 00:15:55.440 align:middle line:84%
Because again, to
me, what helps me

00:15:55.440 --> 00:16:01.350 align:middle line:84%
is that when I understand more
the mechanism of how things

00:16:01.350 --> 00:16:03.550 align:middle line:90%
work, I'm more efficient.

00:16:03.550 --> 00:16:05.850 align:middle line:84%
I'm not just
shooting in the dark.

00:16:05.850 --> 00:16:10.350 align:middle line:84%
Even in energy healing, for
example, I put my hands.

00:16:10.350 --> 00:16:12.150 align:middle line:90%
It's like, what is happening?

00:16:12.150 --> 00:16:13.750 align:middle line:90%
What is it that I'm doing?

00:16:13.750 --> 00:16:15.970 align:middle line:84%
Am I channeling
Archangel Michael?

00:16:15.970 --> 00:16:17.980 align:middle line:90%
Like, what, who, you know?

00:16:17.980 --> 00:16:24.040 align:middle line:84%
And so if you give me this
specificity of things--

00:16:24.040 --> 00:16:27.540 align:middle line:84%
and so I want to share
this with you, because I

00:16:27.540 --> 00:16:29.230 align:middle line:90%
hope it will help you as well.

00:16:29.230 --> 00:16:30.960 align:middle line:90%
So without getting technical.

00:16:30.960 --> 00:16:36.060 align:middle line:84%
But earlier, we talked
about Konstantin Meyl,

00:16:36.060 --> 00:16:37.980 align:middle line:90%
who was working on the DNA.

00:16:37.980 --> 00:16:41.520 align:middle line:84%
And he found out
that the DNA uses

00:16:41.520 --> 00:16:47.820 align:middle line:84%
what we call magnetic scalar
waves to transfer information

00:16:47.820 --> 00:16:51.060 align:middle line:84%
across the universe
back and forth.

00:16:51.060 --> 00:16:54.150 align:middle line:84%
So let's talk a
little bit about that.

00:16:54.150 --> 00:16:59.830 align:middle line:84%
Everybody is familiar with the
sine waves, your EEG, your EKG.

00:16:59.830 --> 00:17:01.830 align:middle line:90%
It's just like a sine wave.

00:17:01.830 --> 00:17:02.980 align:middle line:90%
That's what we see.

00:17:02.980 --> 00:17:07.030 align:middle line:84%
That's the electromagnetic
field is a typical sine wave.

00:17:07.030 --> 00:17:09.000 align:middle line:84%
But there are also
other waves nobody talks

00:17:09.000 --> 00:17:12.750 align:middle line:84%
about-- longitudinal
waves, transverse waves.

00:17:12.750 --> 00:17:15.050 align:middle line:84%
The transverse
waves basically is

00:17:15.050 --> 00:17:22.000 align:middle line:84%
when the wave is perpendicular
to the direction of the wave.

00:17:22.000 --> 00:17:23.690 align:middle line:84%
Anyway, so what
I'm trying to say

00:17:23.690 --> 00:17:27.150 align:middle line:84%
is that there's different types
of waves we don't talk about.

00:17:27.150 --> 00:17:30.320 align:middle line:84%
But the most important one
that I want to talk about

00:17:30.320 --> 00:17:37.700 align:middle line:84%
is that one, the
magnetic scalar wave.

00:17:37.700 --> 00:17:42.050 align:middle line:84%
Magnetic scalar
waves are waves that

00:17:42.050 --> 00:17:46.080 align:middle line:84%
go in all directions-- all
directions all at once.

00:17:46.080 --> 00:17:49.440 align:middle line:90%
And nothing can stop them.

00:17:49.440 --> 00:17:51.740 align:middle line:90%
So you can put a shield.

00:17:51.740 --> 00:17:54.920 align:middle line:90%
You can put a Faraday cage.

00:17:54.920 --> 00:17:57.240 align:middle line:90%
It will go through it.

00:17:57.240 --> 00:18:01.700 align:middle line:84%
That's the reason
why magnetic scalar

00:18:01.700 --> 00:18:07.230 align:middle line:84%
waves can go across the universe
and they are unstoppable.

00:18:07.230 --> 00:18:11.310 align:middle line:84%
Therefore, faster than
the speed of light.

00:18:11.310 --> 00:18:14.490 align:middle line:84%
So your thoughts,
can you guess what

00:18:14.490 --> 00:18:20.760 align:middle line:84%
waves they're using to
communicate with the universe?

00:18:20.760 --> 00:18:22.350 align:middle line:90%
And just by looking--

00:18:22.350 --> 00:18:25.860 align:middle line:84%
just by looking at
this diagram, do

00:18:25.860 --> 00:18:29.070 align:middle line:84%
you think we are
linear like this?

00:18:29.070 --> 00:18:32.140 align:middle line:84%
Or do you think we are
multi-dimensional like this?

00:18:32.140 --> 00:18:32.940 align:middle line:90%
Makes sense?

00:18:32.940 --> 00:18:36.820 align:middle line:84%
Just by looking at it,
doesn't it make more sense?

00:18:36.820 --> 00:18:42.510 align:middle line:84%
And when you think that your
thoughts are sending energy

00:18:42.510 --> 00:18:49.350 align:middle line:84%
in all directions of time space,
I mean, doesn't just that idea

00:18:49.350 --> 00:18:52.883 align:middle line:90%
expend you as a being?

00:18:52.883 --> 00:18:54.300 align:middle line:84%
You start to think
like, wait, I'm

00:18:54.300 --> 00:18:58.290 align:middle line:84%
not this finite little
linear thing in a box

00:18:58.290 --> 00:19:01.270 align:middle line:84%
that I have to-- everything
is linear and small.

00:19:01.270 --> 00:19:04.510 align:middle line:84%
All of a sudden, like, wait,
my consciousness is everywhere.

00:19:04.510 --> 00:19:06.910 align:middle line:90%
It can do this, you see.

00:19:06.910 --> 00:19:10.500 align:middle line:84%
And then again, because
the guy literally

00:19:10.500 --> 00:19:13.440 align:middle line:84%
was able to demonstrate
that mathematically--

00:19:13.440 --> 00:19:18.060 align:middle line:84%
mathematically, you
can read the report.

00:19:18.060 --> 00:19:19.110 align:middle line:90%
Look him up.

00:19:19.110 --> 00:19:23.680 align:middle line:84%
And other scientists are
starting to catch up with this.

00:19:23.680 --> 00:19:28.230 align:middle line:84%
So now when I say, wait, I
received a message from Mars

00:19:28.230 --> 00:19:33.410 align:middle line:84%
from someone on the plane,
it's not so crazy anymore.

00:19:33.410 --> 00:19:40.080 align:middle line:84%
Or I felt-- a message came
to me that my mother is sick.

00:19:40.080 --> 00:19:41.660 align:middle line:90%
She needs me to call her.

00:19:41.660 --> 00:19:42.497 align:middle line:90%
And I call her.

00:19:42.497 --> 00:19:44.330 align:middle line:84%
And sure enough, she
says, how did you know?

00:19:44.330 --> 00:19:47.840 align:middle line:84%
I was just going to ask you to
call me or whatever, you see.

00:19:47.840 --> 00:19:50.190 align:middle line:90%
How are we-- because it's real.

00:19:50.190 --> 00:19:58.180 align:middle line:84%
Because there is science that
we're not taught in school

00:19:58.180 --> 00:19:59.620 align:middle line:90%
that exists.

00:19:59.620 --> 00:20:02.090 align:middle line:84%
All we have to do
is connect the dots.

00:20:02.090 --> 00:20:05.220 align:middle line:84%
And so what I've been
doing my whole life is

00:20:05.220 --> 00:20:09.060 align:middle line:84%
try to connect the dots, find
the evidence for this one thing,

00:20:09.060 --> 00:20:11.420 align:middle line:84%
evidence for this one
thing, evidence for that.

00:20:11.420 --> 00:20:14.130 align:middle line:84%
And then when you
connect the dots,

00:20:14.130 --> 00:20:23.300 align:middle line:84%
you realize that it's actually
very much real and scientific.

00:20:23.300 --> 00:20:25.772 align:middle line:90%
Nobody teaches us.

00:20:25.772 --> 00:20:30.020 align:middle line:84%
So anyway, we're
here to catch up.

00:20:30.020 --> 00:20:30.910 align:middle line:90%
Is this helpful?

00:20:30.910 --> 00:20:31.850 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:20:31.850 --> 00:20:34.041 align:middle line:90%
>> Good, good, good.

00:20:34.041 --> 00:20:40.550 align:middle line:10%
Also entanglement, that was also
demonstrated scientifically.

00:20:40.550 --> 00:20:43.790 align:middle line:10%
Entanglement, two
particles at a distance

00:20:43.790 --> 00:20:47.690 align:middle line:10%
can exchange information.

00:20:47.690 --> 00:20:51.110 align:middle line:84%
At a distance means two
stars that are distanced.

00:20:51.110 --> 00:20:54.410 align:middle line:84%
Exchange information, you
change something with one,

00:20:54.410 --> 00:20:56.540 align:middle line:84%
the other one
changes spontaneously

00:20:56.540 --> 00:20:58.080 align:middle line:90%
because of entanglement.

00:20:58.080 --> 00:21:01.370 align:middle line:84%
So if that's possible,
why is it not possible

00:21:01.370 --> 00:21:05.130 align:middle line:84%
that your brain can entrain
to information at a distance?

00:21:05.130 --> 00:21:06.650 align:middle line:90%
Again, just making the point.

00:21:06.650 --> 00:21:07.940 align:middle line:90%
Making the point.

00:21:07.940 --> 00:21:14.110 align:middle line:84%
OK, let's get to the fun stuff
and start practicing and finding

00:21:14.110 --> 00:21:14.910 align:middle line:90%
tools.

00:21:14.910 --> 00:21:17.180 align:middle line:10%
So what we're going
to do, first of all,

00:21:17.180 --> 00:21:19.610 align:middle line:10%
I'm going to do a little
exercise, like I said,

00:21:19.610 --> 00:21:24.210 align:middle line:10%
to purify, to flush
your system, get

00:21:24.210 --> 00:21:28.410 align:middle line:10%
rid of the mother
and the grandfather

00:21:28.410 --> 00:21:31.440 align:middle line:10%
and everybody else
that's in our field.

00:21:31.440 --> 00:21:34.170 align:middle line:84%
First of all, let me see if
you have any quick questions,

00:21:34.170 --> 00:21:36.760 align:middle line:84%
because we're going to
get into the exercise.

00:21:36.760 --> 00:21:39.720 align:middle line:84%
If you have a paper and
pencil, I can teach you.

00:21:39.720 --> 00:21:42.810 align:middle line:84%
We can download information
through automatic writing, which

00:21:42.810 --> 00:21:44.470 align:middle line:90%
is so fun.

00:21:44.470 --> 00:21:47.760 align:middle line:84%
Otherwise, we're going to
just download information.

00:21:47.760 --> 00:21:51.680 align:middle line:10%
And so questions?

00:21:51.680 --> 00:21:52.970 align:middle line:10%
Can they ask questions.

00:21:52.970 --> 00:21:54.720 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, they can, if I say so.

00:21:54.720 --> 00:21:56.200 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:21:56.200 --> 00:21:58.876 align:middle line:90%
So who has questions?

00:21:58.876 --> 00:22:01.420 align:middle line:90%


00:22:01.420 --> 00:22:03.450 align:middle line:90%
>> Hi, everyone.

00:22:03.450 --> 00:22:06.810 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes I feel like
something horrible is going

00:22:06.810 --> 00:22:08.820 align:middle line:90%
to happen to one of my kids.

00:22:08.820 --> 00:22:13.720 align:middle line:10%
And I keep thinking, this is
just normal because I'm a mom.

00:22:13.720 --> 00:22:17.940 align:middle line:84%
But then I'm really
terrified about that thought.

00:22:17.940 --> 00:22:21.960 align:middle line:84%
>> OK, so that's why I am
showing you that when you get

00:22:21.960 --> 00:22:25.180 align:middle line:84%
this message, the idea
is to have discernment.

00:22:25.180 --> 00:22:29.220 align:middle line:84%
Is it your fear,
your pattern of fear

00:22:29.220 --> 00:22:33.480 align:middle line:84%
that you've been carrying your
whole life that is interfering

00:22:33.480 --> 00:22:35.610 align:middle line:90%
with your intuition?

00:22:35.610 --> 00:22:37.320 align:middle line:90%
Or is it real?

00:22:37.320 --> 00:22:39.450 align:middle line:84%
That's why I'm telling
you about all this--

00:22:39.450 --> 00:22:41.350 align:middle line:90%
so that you learn to discern.

00:22:41.350 --> 00:22:44.130 align:middle line:10%
So before you act
on it, if you have

00:22:44.130 --> 00:22:46.570 align:middle line:10%
that sensation that
something's going to happen--

00:22:46.570 --> 00:22:48.360 align:middle line:10%
by the way, it's typical.

00:22:48.360 --> 00:22:51.780 align:middle line:10%
Every single mother tells
me the exact same thing,

00:22:51.780 --> 00:22:55.380 align:middle line:10%
and you live with
that constant fear

00:22:55.380 --> 00:22:58.440 align:middle line:10%
that something's
going to happen.

00:22:58.440 --> 00:23:03.180 align:middle line:10%
So the idea is before you act on
anything and get all worked up,

00:23:03.180 --> 00:23:06.360 align:middle line:10%
you have to do the
clearing so that you

00:23:06.360 --> 00:23:09.720 align:middle line:10%
can get the message
correctly and identify,

00:23:09.720 --> 00:23:12.330 align:middle line:10%
is it coming from your
subconscious fear?

00:23:12.330 --> 00:23:14.710 align:middle line:10%
Or is it something real?

00:23:14.710 --> 00:23:15.990 align:middle line:90%
And you want to do that.

00:23:15.990 --> 00:23:17.990 align:middle line:90%
Because then, that's the idea.

00:23:17.990 --> 00:23:19.480 align:middle line:90%
The idea is to--

00:23:19.480 --> 00:23:22.660 align:middle line:84%
otherwise, you're
frazzled all the time.

00:23:22.660 --> 00:23:27.100 align:middle line:84%
You're constantly calling your
kids, and nothing's wrong.

00:23:27.100 --> 00:23:30.550 align:middle line:84%
>> It's not like I
call him like that.

00:23:30.550 --> 00:23:32.690 align:middle line:90%
He loves racing cars.

00:23:32.690 --> 00:23:37.320 align:middle line:10%
Anytime that goes, it's
just like, I practically--

00:23:37.320 --> 00:23:39.030 align:middle line:10%
I die until he comes back.

00:23:39.030 --> 00:23:40.300 align:middle line:10%
That's the feeling I have.

00:23:40.300 --> 00:23:44.300 align:middle line:10%
>> Yeah, and other children also
are going to war or doing other

00:23:44.300 --> 00:23:45.100 align:middle line:10%
things.

00:23:45.100 --> 00:23:45.620 align:middle line:10%
>> Yeah, so--

00:23:45.620 --> 00:23:46.828 align:middle line:10%
>> So that's what I'm saying.

00:23:46.828 --> 00:23:49.800 align:middle line:10%
So you have to-- the
subconscious pattern

00:23:49.800 --> 00:23:55.200 align:middle line:10%
that's in you is the fear
of losing your child.

00:23:55.200 --> 00:23:56.160 align:middle line:10%
This is typical.

00:23:56.160 --> 00:23:57.870 align:middle line:10%
But if you don't
work on it, you're

00:23:57.870 --> 00:24:00.990 align:middle line:10%
going to live the rest of
your life being afraid.

00:24:00.990 --> 00:24:02.950 align:middle line:90%
So that's the idea of this work.

00:24:02.950 --> 00:24:05.250 align:middle line:84%
That's the idea is
for you to recognize

00:24:05.250 --> 00:24:09.580 align:middle line:84%
what's in your subconscious mind
and clear it once and for all.

00:24:09.580 --> 00:24:10.595 align:middle line:90%
>> OK, Thank you.

00:24:10.595 --> 00:24:13.205 align:middle line:90%
>> Next

00:24:13.205 --> 00:24:14.005 align:middle line:90%
>> Hi.

00:24:14.005 --> 00:24:14.810 align:middle line:90%
>> Hey.

00:24:14.810 --> 00:24:17.720 align:middle line:90%
>> Thank you.

00:24:17.720 --> 00:24:21.840 align:middle line:84%
I know you've earned your school
of practice, mystical teachings,

00:24:21.840 --> 00:24:22.640 align:middle line:90%
and everything.

00:24:22.640 --> 00:24:26.290 align:middle line:10%
And I'm trying to
also teach my son,

00:24:26.290 --> 00:24:32.360 align:middle line:10%
he is five years old,
how to use his energy.

00:24:32.360 --> 00:24:37.160 align:middle line:10%
Sometimes I can see that he
might process certain things

00:24:37.160 --> 00:24:38.700 align:middle line:10%
that I say to him.

00:24:38.700 --> 00:24:45.100 align:middle line:84%
And sometimes days later, he
may come to me and tell me, mom,

00:24:45.100 --> 00:24:51.410 align:middle line:84%
I know I have light,
but I cannot see it.

00:24:51.410 --> 00:24:55.160 align:middle line:84%
Or he refers-- or sometimes
refers to the light.

00:24:55.160 --> 00:24:56.790 align:middle line:90%
And he's thinking about it.

00:24:56.790 --> 00:25:00.950 align:middle line:84%
And so I know that little,
small seeds of information

00:25:00.950 --> 00:25:04.690 align:middle line:84%
that I'm giving him and
eventually will grow.

00:25:04.690 --> 00:25:07.910 align:middle line:10%
But I just would like to
hear from you and the school

00:25:07.910 --> 00:25:12.870 align:middle line:10%
that you also lead, what
could be simple exercises

00:25:12.870 --> 00:25:15.905 align:middle line:10%
that we can do with our kids?

00:25:15.905 --> 00:25:19.710 align:middle line:10%
>> The exercise I'm about to
do is great for kids as well,

00:25:19.710 --> 00:25:23.860 align:middle line:10%
because actually, kids can
visualize really, really well.

00:25:23.860 --> 00:25:26.730 align:middle line:10%
And do you notice
that babies, when

00:25:26.730 --> 00:25:29.340 align:middle line:10%
they are-- when they come
in, they're looking at you,

00:25:29.340 --> 00:25:30.785 align:middle line:10%
they're not quite
looking at you?

00:25:30.785 --> 00:25:32.910 align:middle line:84%
They're kind of looking
everywhere, because they're

00:25:32.910 --> 00:25:34.390 align:middle line:90%
seeing everything.

00:25:34.390 --> 00:25:38.580 align:middle line:10%
And gradually, that vision gets
smaller and smaller and smaller

00:25:38.580 --> 00:25:40.830 align:middle line:10%
until about the age of three.

00:25:40.830 --> 00:25:44.730 align:middle line:10%
And usually, around the age
four or five, you start--

00:25:44.730 --> 00:25:49.620 align:middle line:10%
usually, all children have some
sort of significant experience

00:25:49.620 --> 00:25:54.020 align:middle line:10%
with these other energies.

00:25:54.020 --> 00:25:54.820 align:middle line:90%
It's positive.

00:25:54.820 --> 00:25:56.370 align:middle line:90%
I'm not saying anything bad.

00:25:56.370 --> 00:25:59.580 align:middle line:84%
But what I'm saying
is, from that point on,

00:25:59.580 --> 00:26:02.700 align:middle line:84%
they start to block
those abilities.

00:26:02.700 --> 00:26:03.970 align:middle line:90%
Because it's too much.

00:26:03.970 --> 00:26:04.930 align:middle line:90%
There's no information.

00:26:04.930 --> 00:26:06.620 align:middle line:84%
They don't know
what to do with it.

00:26:06.620 --> 00:26:09.910 align:middle line:10%
But actually, they're great
at visualizing and imagining.

00:26:09.910 --> 00:26:12.330 align:middle line:10%
So the first exercise
we're going to do

00:26:12.330 --> 00:26:14.320 align:middle line:10%
is this flushing of energy.

00:26:14.320 --> 00:26:17.910 align:middle line:10%
So we're going to bring
a pure source energy.

00:26:17.910 --> 00:26:20.650 align:middle line:10%
And we're going to just
bring it through the body.

00:26:20.650 --> 00:26:23.370 align:middle line:90%
So try that with your son--

00:26:23.370 --> 00:26:24.700 align:middle line:90%
son, you said, yeah?

00:26:24.700 --> 00:26:30.760 align:middle line:84%
And then allow him
to change the colors.

00:26:30.760 --> 00:26:33.780 align:middle line:84%
Imagine different
colors, but every color

00:26:33.780 --> 00:26:37.630 align:middle line:84%
has to have a
positive intention.

00:26:37.630 --> 00:26:39.150 align:middle line:10%
So one is love.

00:26:39.150 --> 00:26:40.410 align:middle line:10%
One is joy.

00:26:40.410 --> 00:26:41.850 align:middle line:10%
One is fun.

00:26:41.850 --> 00:26:42.970 align:middle line:10%
You see what I mean?

00:26:42.970 --> 00:26:45.610 align:middle line:84%
And that's a great exercise
for everybody, by the way.

00:26:45.610 --> 00:26:47.370 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, makes sense?

00:26:47.370 --> 00:26:49.780 align:middle line:90%
All right, next, yeah.

00:26:49.780 --> 00:26:50.580 align:middle line:90%
>> Hi, Carolyn.

00:26:50.580 --> 00:26:52.220 align:middle line:84%
I recently had a
guest on my podcast.

00:26:52.220 --> 00:26:54.387 align:middle line:84%
And we talked a lot
about scalar energy.

00:26:54.387 --> 00:26:55.970 align:middle line:84%
And one of the things
that he had said

00:26:55.970 --> 00:26:59.810 align:middle line:84%
was with his research, that
he had found that energy could

00:26:59.810 --> 00:27:03.590 align:middle line:84%
be sent using a photograph and
the frequency of scalar energy

00:27:03.590 --> 00:27:07.022 align:middle line:84%
to send vitamins and minerals
and healing to people.

00:27:07.022 --> 00:27:09.230 align:middle line:10%
And I'm just wondering if
you've come across anything

00:27:09.230 --> 00:27:10.505 align:middle line:10%
like this in your research.

00:27:10.505 --> 00:27:15.290 align:middle line:10%
>> Yes, I have a device at my
house also that creates a scalar

00:27:15.290 --> 00:27:16.110 align:middle line:10%
field.

00:27:16.110 --> 00:27:18.710 align:middle line:84%
So again, I didn't want
to go too technical.

00:27:18.710 --> 00:27:20.790 align:middle line:90%
But since you're asking--

00:27:20.790 --> 00:27:22.940 align:middle line:84%
so by the way, I
forgot to mention

00:27:22.940 --> 00:27:24.360 align:middle line:90%
something very important.

00:27:24.360 --> 00:27:27.050 align:middle line:90%
The heart has its own field.

00:27:27.050 --> 00:27:29.130 align:middle line:10%
And that's a scalar field.

00:27:29.130 --> 00:27:32.430 align:middle line:10%
So the idea, scalar field,
meaning it's perfect.

00:27:32.430 --> 00:27:36.510 align:middle line:10%
It's a torus-like field
that emanates information,

00:27:36.510 --> 00:27:39.250 align:middle line:10%
like I said, like the scalar
waves in all directions of time

00:27:39.250 --> 00:27:40.050 align:middle line:10%
space.

00:27:40.050 --> 00:27:44.510 align:middle line:10%
So when your brain, your
mind, and your heart

00:27:44.510 --> 00:27:51.210 align:middle line:10%
are perfectly coherent with
each other, then you can expand.

00:27:51.210 --> 00:27:53.280 align:middle line:10%
And you can send this
information, which

00:27:53.280 --> 00:27:54.740 align:middle line:10%
is what we're going to do.

00:27:54.740 --> 00:27:55.970 align:middle line:90%
So what was the question?

00:27:55.970 --> 00:27:58.330 align:middle line:90%
Oh, about the scalar energy.

00:27:58.330 --> 00:28:04.020 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, so these devices
that emit the scalar field,

00:28:04.020 --> 00:28:08.560 align:middle line:84%
if they are in proximity like
in this room-- it depends.

00:28:08.560 --> 00:28:10.390 align:middle line:90%
Each one has a different range.

00:28:10.390 --> 00:28:15.150 align:middle line:84%
But mine can cover half
of this room, for example.

00:28:15.150 --> 00:28:19.740 align:middle line:10%
If I'm sitting in that
field and I'm off,

00:28:19.740 --> 00:28:22.290 align:middle line:10%
my body is off, I'm
frustrated or whatever,

00:28:22.290 --> 00:28:27.040 align:middle line:10%
I'm going to start to
entrain to that field.

00:28:27.040 --> 00:28:31.560 align:middle line:84%
And so my heart is
already functioning,

00:28:31.560 --> 00:28:33.760 align:middle line:90%
emitting a scalar field.

00:28:33.760 --> 00:28:35.470 align:middle line:90%
My brain is going to entrain.

00:28:35.470 --> 00:28:37.510 align:middle line:90%
You guys know about entrainment?

00:28:37.510 --> 00:28:41.730 align:middle line:84%
So basically, I'm going to
match, let's say, the field.

00:28:41.730 --> 00:28:43.930 align:middle line:84%
And then I'm going to
be in perfect alignment.

00:28:43.930 --> 00:28:46.560 align:middle line:84%
And that alignment-- we
didn't talk a lot about this.

00:28:46.560 --> 00:28:50.460 align:middle line:10%
But the DNA-- we did a bunch
of experiments on this.

00:28:50.460 --> 00:28:53.280 align:middle line:10%
The DNA, which is a
double helix, when

00:28:53.280 --> 00:28:56.850 align:middle line:10%
you create a certain field and
you create and you increase

00:28:56.850 --> 00:28:59.760 align:middle line:10%
the electrical
conductivity of the DNA,

00:28:59.760 --> 00:29:06.180 align:middle line:10%
it turns into a torus-like shape
and it starts to self-repair.

00:29:06.180 --> 00:29:12.370 align:middle line:84%
So the scalar field allows you
to basically do the same thing.

00:29:12.370 --> 00:29:16.170 align:middle line:84%
The DNA starts to rotate
in a torus-like formation,

00:29:16.170 --> 00:29:17.710 align:middle line:90%
and you self-repair.

00:29:17.710 --> 00:29:19.900 align:middle line:84%
That's how you're
getting the healing.

00:29:19.900 --> 00:29:21.973 align:middle line:90%
Makes sense?

00:29:21.973 --> 00:29:23.890 align:middle line:84%
Now, there's different
technologies out there,

00:29:23.890 --> 00:29:24.980 align:middle line:90%
by the way.

00:29:24.980 --> 00:29:27.970 align:middle line:10%
So I'm not talking
about all of them

00:29:27.970 --> 00:29:29.840 align:middle line:10%
because I have to
research all of them.

00:29:29.840 --> 00:29:31.300 align:middle line:90%
But there's a couple out there.

00:29:31.300 --> 00:29:34.780 align:middle line:90%
And you have to discern.

00:29:34.780 --> 00:29:36.340 align:middle line:90%
All right, here we go.

00:29:36.340 --> 00:29:42.850 align:middle line:84%
The first thing is for you to
be clear on your intention.

00:29:42.850 --> 00:29:49.240 align:middle line:84%
Do you want to download
information about what?

00:29:49.240 --> 00:29:52.810 align:middle line:84%
As you know, you
are able to receive

00:29:52.810 --> 00:29:59.380 align:middle line:84%
messages, information, knowledge
from your own higher self.

00:29:59.380 --> 00:30:01.630 align:middle line:84%
We didn't talk about the
past and future self,

00:30:01.630 --> 00:30:05.980 align:middle line:84%
but for now, other
aspects of your being.

00:30:05.980 --> 00:30:09.920 align:middle line:10%
Do you want to download
information from source?

00:30:09.920 --> 00:30:13.275 align:middle line:84%
Do you want to
speak to an alien?

00:30:13.275 --> 00:30:17.660 align:middle line:84%
You take a moment
to be very specific,

00:30:17.660 --> 00:30:21.780 align:middle line:84%
my intention right now in
terms of receiving information.

00:30:21.780 --> 00:30:24.920 align:middle line:90%
That's what this class is about.

00:30:24.920 --> 00:30:27.065 align:middle line:90%
Take a moment to do that.

00:30:27.065 --> 00:30:39.550 align:middle line:90%


00:30:39.550 --> 00:30:41.710 align:middle line:90%
Are you clear?

00:30:41.710 --> 00:30:43.750 align:middle line:84%
If you're not clear,
can you please tell me

00:30:43.750 --> 00:30:45.715 align:middle line:90%
what your intention is?

00:30:45.715 --> 00:30:46.515 align:middle line:90%
Go ahead.

00:30:46.515 --> 00:30:51.690 align:middle line:90%


00:30:51.690 --> 00:30:55.020 align:middle line:84%
so she's working on a
book that was downloaded.

00:30:55.020 --> 00:30:57.600 align:middle line:84%
>> A book that I'm working on
in tandem with someone else

00:30:57.600 --> 00:30:59.220 align:middle line:90%
that's about halfway through.

00:30:59.220 --> 00:31:02.320 align:middle line:84%
And there's two stories that
were downloaded in meditation.

00:31:02.320 --> 00:31:07.900 align:middle line:84%
So I asked for all three to be
dropped in full and complete.

00:31:07.900 --> 00:31:11.770 align:middle line:84%
So it's three elements,
but it's one topic area.

00:31:11.770 --> 00:31:13.787 align:middle line:84%
>> So what's the--
what are you--

00:31:13.787 --> 00:31:15.620 align:middle line:84%
I mean, if it's already
downloaded, what's--

00:31:15.620 --> 00:31:18.203 align:middle line:84%
>> So I'm asking for them to be
downloaded because I have bits

00:31:18.203 --> 00:31:19.200 align:middle line:90%
and pieces.

00:31:19.200 --> 00:31:22.660 align:middle line:84%
So I guess my question is, it's
the same topic area, but three

00:31:22.660 --> 00:31:23.460 align:middle line:90%
different items.

00:31:23.460 --> 00:31:25.752 align:middle line:84%
Should I address each one
separately on different days?

00:31:25.752 --> 00:31:27.620 align:middle line:90%
Or is one topic area--

00:31:27.620 --> 00:31:28.710 align:middle line:90%
>> OK, that's clear.

00:31:28.710 --> 00:31:29.510 align:middle line:90%
That's right.

00:31:29.510 --> 00:31:32.550 align:middle line:84%
Is it three separate
topics or one together?

00:31:32.550 --> 00:31:33.350 align:middle line:90%
See what I mean?

00:31:33.350 --> 00:31:34.430 align:middle line:90%
Super clear.

00:31:34.430 --> 00:31:35.340 align:middle line:90%
Makes sense?

00:31:35.340 --> 00:31:38.110 align:middle line:90%
Who are you asking?

00:31:38.110 --> 00:31:38.970 align:middle line:90%
Higher self.

00:31:38.970 --> 00:31:39.770 align:middle line:90%
Clear.

00:31:39.770 --> 00:31:40.930 align:middle line:90%
Make sense?

00:31:40.930 --> 00:31:43.920 align:middle line:84%
Higher self, is it
three or one thing?

00:31:43.920 --> 00:31:44.720 align:middle line:90%
Very clear.

00:31:44.720 --> 00:31:46.785 align:middle line:90%
Last one so we can do it.

00:31:46.785 --> 00:31:50.350 align:middle line:90%
>> My intention is why--

00:31:50.350 --> 00:31:55.782 align:middle line:84%
my question is, will
I become a healer?

00:31:55.782 --> 00:31:57.520 align:middle line:90%
>> Will I become a healer?

00:31:57.520 --> 00:31:58.350 align:middle line:90%
>> Is that a--

00:31:58.350 --> 00:31:59.300 align:middle line:90%
>> Who are you asking?

00:31:59.300 --> 00:32:00.940 align:middle line:90%
>> I'm asking my higher self.

00:32:00.940 --> 00:32:04.460 align:middle line:84%
>> OK, what do you
think of this question?

00:32:04.460 --> 00:32:07.088 align:middle line:90%
What kind of healer?

00:32:07.088 --> 00:32:07.952 align:middle line:90%
>> No?

00:32:07.952 --> 00:32:09.450 align:middle line:90%
>> Is that a good one?

00:32:09.450 --> 00:32:10.510 align:middle line:90%
>> Medical healer.

00:32:10.510 --> 00:32:13.070 align:middle line:90%
>> OK, that's clear enough.

00:32:13.070 --> 00:32:13.980 align:middle line:90%
That's OK.

00:32:13.980 --> 00:32:16.830 align:middle line:84%
I'm asking my higher--
it's very specific.

00:32:16.830 --> 00:32:20.820 align:middle line:84%
I'm asking my higher self, am I
going to be-- or is it aligned--

00:32:20.820 --> 00:32:22.640 align:middle line:84%
I mean, you can do
whatever you want.

00:32:22.640 --> 00:32:25.190 align:middle line:84%
But you're asking, is
that aligned with who I am

00:32:25.190 --> 00:32:26.710 align:middle line:90%
and my higher purpose?

00:32:26.710 --> 00:32:27.710 align:middle line:90%
Makes sense?

00:32:27.710 --> 00:32:28.680 align:middle line:90%
OK, let's start.

00:32:28.680 --> 00:32:29.480 align:middle line:90%
Let's do this.
