00:00:11.590 --> 00:00:19.270 align:middle line:10%
>> In addition to this, in
November, November 10 of 2009,

00:00:19.270 --> 00:00:22.390 align:middle line:10%
just as Lou Elizondo was
stepping up to become

00:00:22.390 --> 00:00:27.610 align:middle line:10%
the Executive Director of
the Advanced Aerospace Threat

00:00:27.610 --> 00:00:34.600 align:middle line:10%
Identification Project,
the Vatican in Rome,

00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:39.700 align:middle line:10%
and that was Pope
Benedict XI, not Francis,

00:00:39.700 --> 00:00:42.790 align:middle line:10%
not the progressive, not the
Jesuit guy that they all think

00:00:42.790 --> 00:00:46.370 align:middle line:10%
is trying to change the world
in some kind of utopian way.

00:00:46.370 --> 00:00:50.830 align:middle line:90%
But Benedict, who was the--

00:00:50.830 --> 00:00:53.410 align:middle line:84%
Ratzinger-- Karl
Ratzinger, who was

00:00:53.410 --> 00:00:58.040 align:middle line:84%
the head of the Committee for
the doctrine of the Faith,

00:00:58.040 --> 00:01:03.580 align:middle line:84%
hardball, tough guy, kind of
the hammer inside the Church.

00:01:03.580 --> 00:01:10.760 align:middle line:84%
He is Pope convened a gathering
of the world scientists in Rome

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:15.020 align:middle line:84%
actually at the Castel
Gandolfo, just outside of Rome,

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:17.690 align:middle line:90%
where the papal observatory is.

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:20.240 align:middle line:84%
And they had a week
long discussion

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:23.930 align:middle line:84%
among the world's scientists
with Vatican hierarchy,

00:01:23.930 --> 00:01:25.980 align:middle line:90%
including Benedict.

00:01:25.980 --> 00:01:30.740 align:middle line:84%
And he gave the directions
to Father José Gabriel Funes,

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:35.420 align:middle line:84%
who was the Jesuit director
of the Pontifical Observatory

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:38.490 align:middle line:84%
at Castel Gandolfo,
to go back into Rome.

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:44.150 align:middle line:84%
And from the official press
room of the Vatican on the 10th

00:01:44.150 --> 00:01:49.310 align:middle line:84%
of November of 2009, issued the
following official statement

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:50.720 align:middle line:90%
of the Vatican.

00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:55.680 align:middle line:84%
It said, "In light of the
discovery of more and more

00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:59.610 align:middle line:84%
of these new exoplanets
that are being discovered

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:02.040 align:middle line:84%
by the launching
by our human family

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:04.680 align:middle line:84%
of these new
spaceborne telescopes,

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:07.470 align:middle line:84%
it has now become
clear that much

00:02:07.470 --> 00:02:11.430 align:middle line:84%
sooner than had been
previously anticipated,

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:14.640 align:middle line:84%
our human family is going
to discover life elsewhere

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:16.380 align:middle line:90%
in the universe.

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:21.810 align:middle line:84%
Therefore, the time has arrived
for us to begin the extremely

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:26.160 align:middle line:84%
important discussion of
the profound philosophical

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:30.090 align:middle line:84%
and theological questions that
are posed to our human family

00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:33.730 align:middle line:84%
by the discovery of life
elsewhere in the universe."

00:02:33.730 --> 00:02:38.850 align:middle line:84%
Now, upon my hearing that
as the former General

00:02:38.850 --> 00:02:40.800 align:middle line:84%
Counsel for the
United States Jesuit

00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:45.210 align:middle line:84%
headquarters in Washington, in
their social ministry office,

00:02:45.210 --> 00:02:47.670 align:middle line:84%
their big national social
ministry office in Washington,

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:51.030 align:middle line:84%
D.C. that deals with major
public policy issues,

00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:53.400 align:middle line:84%
ranging everywhere from
thermonuclear weapons

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:58.750 align:middle line:84%
to abortion and poverty
issues and all that.

00:02:58.750 --> 00:03:02.760 align:middle line:84%
That in my official capacity
as that former member,

00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:08.370 align:middle line:84%
I contacted José Gabriel
Funes and flew to see him.

00:03:08.370 --> 00:03:11.610 align:middle line:84%
And within minutes of
beginning of our conversation,

00:03:11.610 --> 00:03:15.000 align:middle line:84%
he said, well, in that
statement that we issued,

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:20.470 align:middle line:84%
we are not talking here about
some single cell life form

00:03:20.470 --> 00:03:23.950 align:middle line:84%
under some frozen sea
on some distant moon

00:03:23.950 --> 00:03:27.230 align:middle line:84%
of some distant planet
and some far off galaxy.

00:03:27.230 --> 00:03:30.610 align:middle line:84%
We are talking about
another highly intelligent,

00:03:30.610 --> 00:03:34.780 align:middle line:84%
highly technologically
developed, but distinctly

00:03:34.780 --> 00:03:39.995 align:middle line:84%
non-human species right here
in our Milky Way Galaxy.

00:03:39.995 --> 00:03:43.860 align:middle line:90%


00:03:43.860 --> 00:03:49.350 align:middle line:84%
And so the immediate-- the
day immediately following

00:03:49.350 --> 00:03:57.160 align:middle line:84%
the testimony of Colonel Grosch
in front of the Congress on July

00:03:57.160 --> 00:04:04.260 align:middle line:84%
27 of this year, the United
States Senate Intelligence

00:04:04.260 --> 00:04:10.520 align:middle line:84%
Committee passed
unanimously all republicans,

00:04:10.520 --> 00:04:13.980 align:middle line:84%
all Democrats voting
in favor of it,

00:04:13.980 --> 00:04:17.450 align:middle line:84%
all 17 members of the United
States Senate Intelligence

00:04:17.450 --> 00:04:21.050 align:middle line:84%
Committee voted to send to
the floor of the United States

00:04:21.050 --> 00:04:29.870 align:middle line:84%
Senate a 64-page amendment to
be added to the 2024 National

00:04:29.870 --> 00:04:31.740 align:middle line:90%
Defense Authorization Act.

00:04:31.740 --> 00:04:37.850 align:middle line:84%
This is that 1,000 page document
that gets passed every December

00:04:37.850 --> 00:04:43.550 align:middle line:84%
covering everything from toilet
seats to tanks and new aircraft

00:04:43.550 --> 00:04:46.730 align:middle line:84%
carriers for the
United States military.

00:04:46.730 --> 00:04:54.800 align:middle line:84%
And this bill was sponsored
by Chuck Schumer, the Majority

00:04:54.800 --> 00:04:56.570 align:middle line:84%
Leader of the United
States Senate,

00:04:56.570 --> 00:05:03.860 align:middle line:84%
and Marco Rubio, the extremely
conservative United States

00:05:03.860 --> 00:05:08.540 align:middle line:84%
Senator from Florida who was
the Vice Chair of the Senate

00:05:08.540 --> 00:05:10.770 align:middle line:90%
Intelligence Committee.

00:05:10.770 --> 00:05:14.160 align:middle line:84%
And this bill was put to the
floor of the United States

00:05:14.160 --> 00:05:18.660 align:middle line:90%
Senate and it passed 89 to 11.

00:05:18.660 --> 00:05:22.590 align:middle line:84%
And the 11 votes against it
were against other portions

00:05:22.590 --> 00:05:25.820 align:middle line:84%
of the National Defense
Authorization Act, not this.

00:05:25.820 --> 00:05:28.970 align:middle line:84%
So there was unanimous
support for this bill.

00:05:28.970 --> 00:05:34.850 align:middle line:84%
And it has been sent back down
to the House of Representatives

00:05:34.850 --> 00:05:37.870 align:middle line:90%
for them to vote on this.

00:05:37.870 --> 00:05:41.160 align:middle line:84%
Now when it came down to the
house, what the house did,

00:05:41.160 --> 00:05:43.772 align:middle line:84%
this group of
eight people that's

00:05:43.772 --> 00:05:46.230 align:middle line:84%
in the House of Representatives
that you've heard something

00:05:46.230 --> 00:05:53.250 align:middle line:84%
about recently, Matt Gaetz and
Margie Greene and these people.

00:05:53.250 --> 00:05:57.270 align:middle line:84%
That what they did
is they succeeded

00:05:57.270 --> 00:06:01.390 align:middle line:84%
with the Speaker of the
House, then Kevin McCarthy,

00:06:01.390 --> 00:06:04.320 align:middle line:84%
they succeeded in putting
in a dozen amendments,

00:06:04.320 --> 00:06:07.890 align:middle line:84%
not to this part of the National
Defense Authorization Act,

00:06:07.890 --> 00:06:10.060 align:middle line:90%
left it completely untouched.

00:06:10.060 --> 00:06:12.630 align:middle line:84%
But they put into
the General Bill

00:06:12.630 --> 00:06:15.690 align:middle line:84%
other things saying that no
money in the military budget

00:06:15.690 --> 00:06:17.520 align:middle line:84%
could be spent for
educating anybody

00:06:17.520 --> 00:06:20.160 align:middle line:84%
in the military
about racial justice.

00:06:20.160 --> 00:06:24.420 align:middle line:84%
Nobody could put any information
in there about birth control.

00:06:24.420 --> 00:06:29.880 align:middle line:84%
Nobody could put any information
in there about climate change.

00:06:29.880 --> 00:06:32.410 align:middle line:84%
They put in a list
of these amendments.

00:06:32.410 --> 00:06:36.330 align:middle line:84%
And that was the reason that
the 11 most liberal senators

00:06:36.330 --> 00:06:39.390 align:middle line:84%
in the Senate voted
against the bill.

00:06:39.390 --> 00:06:44.280 align:middle line:84%
Otherwise, it would have been
a vote of 100 to nothing.

00:06:44.280 --> 00:06:48.690 align:middle line:84%
So now that those
additional crazy amendments

00:06:48.690 --> 00:06:51.270 align:middle line:90%
that I don't agree with.

00:06:51.270 --> 00:06:54.870 align:middle line:84%
And the people in the
Senate don't agree with.

00:06:54.870 --> 00:06:56.430 align:middle line:84%
Now that they're
put in there, there

00:06:56.430 --> 00:07:00.450 align:middle line:84%
has to be a conference committee
between the form of it that

00:07:00.450 --> 00:07:02.730 align:middle line:84%
was passed by the House and
the form of the thing that

00:07:02.730 --> 00:07:04.060 align:middle line:90%
was passed by the Senate.

00:07:04.060 --> 00:07:10.770 align:middle line:84%
And so now that, that is
underway, that discussion,

00:07:10.770 --> 00:07:15.600 align:middle line:84%
it opens up people to take a
look at these other 64 pages

00:07:15.600 --> 00:07:18.870 align:middle line:84%
in there and to see what they
think about these things.

00:07:18.870 --> 00:07:21.720 align:middle line:84%
Now what I've done
today is I've come

00:07:21.720 --> 00:07:27.630 align:middle line:84%
to you today to talk with you
about this particular bill.

00:07:27.630 --> 00:07:28.850 align:middle line:90%
Here it is.

00:07:28.850 --> 00:07:35.520 align:middle line:84%
Now this is one of the best
kept secrets in the country

00:07:35.520 --> 00:07:36.410 align:middle line:90%
right now.

00:07:36.410 --> 00:07:39.990 align:middle line:84%
Better than the secret
about the UFOS, I might add.

00:07:39.990 --> 00:07:46.200 align:middle line:84%
And this is the bill itself that
has been passed by the United

00:07:46.200 --> 00:07:50.730 align:middle line:84%
States Senate, has been passed
now as part of the National

00:07:50.730 --> 00:07:53.460 align:middle line:84%
Defense Authorization
Act in the House side,

00:07:53.460 --> 00:07:55.540 align:middle line:84%
but is now in
Conference Committee.

00:07:55.540 --> 00:07:58.860 align:middle line:84%
And what I want to do is I want
to talk with you about this,

00:07:58.860 --> 00:08:04.320 align:middle line:84%
because the provisions of this
are absolutely revolutionary.

00:08:04.320 --> 00:08:08.400 align:middle line:84%
Now that many of you may have
been to Richard Dolan's--

00:08:08.400 --> 00:08:10.270 align:middle line:84%
how many people went
to Richard Dolan's?

00:08:10.270 --> 00:08:11.070 align:middle line:90%
Good.

00:08:11.070 --> 00:08:11.870 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:08:11.870 --> 00:08:18.090 align:middle line:84%
So you heard Richard's who
was a very dear friend of mine

00:08:18.090 --> 00:08:26.100 align:middle line:84%
for decades now who doesn't
trust the United States

00:08:26.100 --> 00:08:31.230 align:middle line:84%
government and doesn't trust
the national security state

00:08:31.230 --> 00:08:34.740 align:middle line:84%
infrastructure, doesn't
trust the major news

00:08:34.740 --> 00:08:39.600 align:middle line:84%
media, all of which
are reasons why

00:08:39.600 --> 00:08:43.260 align:middle line:84%
I'm very good friends with
Richard Dolan, I might add.

00:08:43.260 --> 00:08:44.670 align:middle line:84%
And the reason
that we're friends

00:08:44.670 --> 00:08:46.960 align:middle line:84%
is because I did the
Pentagon Papers case.

00:08:46.960 --> 00:08:48.480 align:middle line:84%
And I did the
Karen Silkwood case

00:08:48.480 --> 00:08:51.780 align:middle line:84%
that revealed the fact that the
Central Intelligence Agency was

00:08:51.780 --> 00:08:55.050 align:middle line:84%
smuggling 98% pure bomb
grade plutonium out

00:08:55.050 --> 00:08:58.980 align:middle line:84%
of her nuclear facility
to both Israel and Iran.

00:08:58.980 --> 00:09:02.010 align:middle line:84%
The fact that I
did the Iran Contra

00:09:02.010 --> 00:09:05.830 align:middle line:84%
case that exposed the
fact that the Reagan Bush

00:09:05.830 --> 00:09:08.360 align:middle line:84%
administration was smuggling
weapons to the Contras

00:09:08.360 --> 00:09:11.500 align:middle line:84%
and smuggling cocaine back
into the United States.

00:09:11.500 --> 00:09:15.868 align:middle line:84%
That's the reason why
I don't trust them.

00:09:15.868 --> 00:09:22.330 align:middle line:84%
But what's happened here is
because Lou Elizondo reached out

00:09:22.330 --> 00:09:27.040 align:middle line:84%
to me when he went forward
and brought these video tapes

00:09:27.040 --> 00:09:28.550 align:middle line:90%
to the New York Times.

00:09:28.550 --> 00:09:31.930 align:middle line:84%
The reason that he contacted
me to represent him

00:09:31.930 --> 00:09:36.160 align:middle line:84%
was because I for 20 years
had been the legal counsel

00:09:36.160 --> 00:09:41.160 align:middle line:84%
for the Disclosure Project of
Dr. Steven Greer's Disclosure

00:09:41.160 --> 00:09:41.960 align:middle line:90%
Project.

00:09:41.960 --> 00:09:47.920 align:middle line:84%
And I was the legal counsel for
Steve Bassett's 2013 citizens

00:09:47.920 --> 00:09:50.230 align:middle line:90%
hearing on disclosure.

00:09:50.230 --> 00:09:52.840 align:middle line:84%
And of course, he knew that
I was John Mack's lawyer.

00:09:52.840 --> 00:09:59.290 align:middle line:84%
So it wasn't a random decision
on his part to contact me,

00:09:59.290 --> 00:10:01.040 align:middle line:90%
to have me represent him.

00:10:01.040 --> 00:10:03.760 align:middle line:84%
This was to make
it clear that he

00:10:03.760 --> 00:10:09.830 align:middle line:84%
was sincere about wanting to
get this information disclosed.

00:10:09.830 --> 00:10:14.350 align:middle line:84%
And so what's happened here
is that because of that,

00:10:14.350 --> 00:10:18.730 align:middle line:84%
I have gotten to be
introduced by Lou Elizondo

00:10:18.730 --> 00:10:21.670 align:middle line:84%
to a lot of the people,
the players who've

00:10:21.670 --> 00:10:26.500 align:middle line:84%
been involved in drafting
this particular statute.

00:10:26.500 --> 00:10:28.580 align:middle line:90%
So I know who drafted it.

00:10:28.580 --> 00:10:30.550 align:middle line:84%
I know the discussions
that have gone on

00:10:30.550 --> 00:10:33.050 align:middle line:84%
with regard to particular
provisions of this.

00:10:33.050 --> 00:10:34.840 align:middle line:90%
And this is why--

00:10:34.840 --> 00:10:39.760 align:middle line:84%
this is why our new
Paradigm Institute

00:10:39.760 --> 00:10:44.260 align:middle line:84%
that I run in
Washington, D.C. has

00:10:44.260 --> 00:10:47.260 align:middle line:84%
been named as one
of the nine entities

00:10:47.260 --> 00:10:52.080 align:middle line:84%
that has been authorized by
Congress to nominate persons

00:10:52.080 --> 00:10:57.990 align:middle line:84%
to participate in a
nine-person board that is going

00:10:57.990 --> 00:11:03.390 align:middle line:84%
to be extracting all of
the information about UFOs

00:11:03.390 --> 00:11:08.010 align:middle line:84%
and all of the information about
extraterrestrial intelligence

00:11:08.010 --> 00:11:14.760 align:middle line:84%
and other non-human intelligence
and turn it over to this board.

00:11:14.760 --> 00:11:18.000 align:middle line:84%
And then turn it over to the
Senate and House Intelligence

00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:18.880 align:middle line:90%
Committees.

00:11:18.880 --> 00:11:24.300 align:middle line:84%
And the other ones are the
Majority Leader of the Senate,

00:11:24.300 --> 00:11:26.430 align:middle line:84%
the Minority Leader
of the Senate,

00:11:26.430 --> 00:11:29.010 align:middle line:84%
the Majority Leader or
Speaker of the House,

00:11:29.010 --> 00:11:30.930 align:middle line:84%
the Minority Leader
of the House,

00:11:30.930 --> 00:11:36.630 align:middle line:84%
the Secretary of Defense and
others, and our Institute.

00:11:36.630 --> 00:11:39.660 align:middle line:84%
So we find ourselves
in a position

00:11:39.660 --> 00:11:43.950 align:middle line:84%
as representing the people,
the people's advocate,

00:11:43.950 --> 00:11:48.120 align:middle line:84%
to nominate people to
the president to be

00:11:48.120 --> 00:11:50.970 align:middle line:90%
on this nine-person board.

00:11:50.970 --> 00:11:56.270 align:middle line:84%
And that this board is
authorized by the statute

00:11:56.270 --> 00:12:01.460 align:middle line:84%
not only to extract the
information from all six

00:12:01.460 --> 00:12:05.720 align:middle line:84%
of the United States
military services and all 18

00:12:05.720 --> 00:12:07.640 align:middle line:84%
of the United
States intelligence

00:12:07.640 --> 00:12:12.200 align:middle line:84%
agencies and all 32 of the
United States Defense Department

00:12:12.200 --> 00:12:13.070 align:middle line:90%
agencies.

00:12:13.070 --> 00:12:18.910 align:middle line:84%
And importantly, all of
the government contractors,

00:12:18.910 --> 00:12:23.740 align:middle line:84%
private corporate contractors to
extract all of the information

00:12:23.740 --> 00:12:27.980 align:middle line:84%
from them that they have come
into possession of since January

00:12:27.980 --> 00:12:34.900 align:middle line:84%
1st of 1945 relating to the UFO
phenomenon and any non-human

00:12:34.900 --> 00:12:38.701 align:middle line:90%
intelligence connected with it.

00:12:38.701 --> 00:12:43.660 align:middle line:84%
And that, as Richard has said,
Richard isn't entirely convinced

00:12:43.660 --> 00:12:46.480 align:middle line:84%
that this is going
to be effective

00:12:46.480 --> 00:12:51.200 align:middle line:84%
because of how deeply buried
some of this information is.

00:12:51.200 --> 00:12:55.090 align:middle line:84%
But the bottom line is, is that
what I've come here tonight

00:12:55.090 --> 00:12:58.240 align:middle line:84%
to tell you, that the
people's advocate,

00:12:58.240 --> 00:13:05.530 align:middle line:84%
our office is on the job to
make sure that does take place.

00:13:05.530 --> 00:13:10.750 align:middle line:84%
And that we have been
effective in the past,

00:13:10.750 --> 00:13:14.140 align:middle line:84%
not only in getting
at the information

00:13:14.140 --> 00:13:16.270 align:middle line:84%
in the top secret
Pentagon papers,

00:13:16.270 --> 00:13:19.220 align:middle line:84%
not only getting access
to the secret information

00:13:19.220 --> 00:13:22.010 align:middle line:84%
about the smuggling of
plutonium by the CIA

00:13:22.010 --> 00:13:25.670 align:middle line:84%
to Israel and Iran
and the other things.

00:13:25.670 --> 00:13:29.660 align:middle line:84%
But we know how to get at
this kind of information.

00:13:29.660 --> 00:13:33.560 align:middle line:84%
If, in fact, these agencies
and these private corporations

00:13:33.560 --> 00:13:38.300 align:middle line:84%
are withholding information,
we will find out about it.

00:13:38.300 --> 00:13:40.160 align:middle line:84%
And what we are
going to do is we

00:13:40.160 --> 00:13:45.050 align:middle line:84%
are going to mobilize the
American people to take

00:13:45.050 --> 00:13:48.080 align:middle line:84%
the position that all
of this information

00:13:48.080 --> 00:13:52.070 align:middle line:84%
is to be turned over to
the United States Congress.

00:13:52.070 --> 00:13:54.620 align:middle line:84%
Because the excluding
of the United States

00:13:54.620 --> 00:13:57.020 align:middle line:84%
Congress from this
extraordinarily valuable

00:13:57.020 --> 00:14:00.700 align:middle line:84%
information is a violation of
the Constitution of our United

00:14:00.700 --> 00:14:01.500 align:middle line:90%
States.

00:14:01.500 --> 00:14:03.290 align:middle line:84%
The Congress of
the United States

00:14:03.290 --> 00:14:05.550 align:middle line:84%
is the government of
our United States.

00:14:05.550 --> 00:14:06.750 align:middle line:90%
They pass the laws.

00:14:06.750 --> 00:14:08.070 align:middle line:90%
They make the policy.

00:14:08.070 --> 00:14:11.740 align:middle line:84%
The executive branch
is there to enforce it.

00:14:11.740 --> 00:14:15.430 align:middle line:84%
But not to make it up themselves
and not to keep secrets

00:14:15.430 --> 00:14:18.880 align:middle line:90%
from the Congress.

00:14:18.880 --> 00:14:20.740 align:middle line:84%
Now, that raises
the question as to

00:14:20.740 --> 00:14:24.520 align:middle line:84%
whether or not it is
appropriate for the Congress

00:14:24.520 --> 00:14:28.090 align:middle line:84%
to know certain secrets
that they do not

00:14:28.090 --> 00:14:30.680 align:middle line:90%
reveal to the public.

00:14:30.680 --> 00:14:33.080 align:middle line:84%
And we'll put a little
tack in that one

00:14:33.080 --> 00:14:35.120 align:middle line:90%
and we'll talk about that.

00:14:35.120 --> 00:14:40.220 align:middle line:84%
But the move that we're engaged
in with this particular statute

00:14:40.220 --> 00:14:42.860 align:middle line:84%
is to get this
information transferred

00:14:42.860 --> 00:14:45.830 align:middle line:90%
into the hands of Congress.

00:14:45.830 --> 00:14:47.930 align:middle line:84%
And then we'll deal
with the question

00:14:47.930 --> 00:14:50.750 align:middle line:84%
as to whether Congress
is revealing enough

00:14:50.750 --> 00:14:54.260 align:middle line:90%
of the information to us.

00:14:54.260 --> 00:14:59.810 align:middle line:84%
Now what I've done is
I've brought this with us

00:14:59.810 --> 00:15:03.170 align:middle line:84%
here today because I
want to be able to--

00:15:03.170 --> 00:15:06.590 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I couldn't
have asked for anything

00:15:06.590 --> 00:15:10.450 align:middle line:84%
better than for Richard to
introduce this subject to you

00:15:10.450 --> 00:15:13.880 align:middle line:84%
with all of his extraordinarily
important and sincerely

00:15:13.880 --> 00:15:17.600 align:middle line:90%
heartfelt reservations about it.

00:15:17.600 --> 00:15:19.820 align:middle line:84%
Because, I mean, if I
thought that this was just

00:15:19.820 --> 00:15:22.430 align:middle line:84%
going to work like
that, I'd be down

00:15:22.430 --> 00:15:24.770 align:middle line:90%
in the Bahamas taking it easy.

00:15:24.770 --> 00:15:27.560 align:middle line:84%
I'd actually get to spend
time with my wife and children

00:15:27.560 --> 00:15:29.090 align:middle line:90%
finally.

00:15:29.090 --> 00:15:33.560 align:middle line:84%
But the bottom line is,
I don't have confidence

00:15:33.560 --> 00:15:35.580 align:middle line:90%
that it's going to be easy.

00:15:35.580 --> 00:15:40.055 align:middle line:84%
I think it's going to have to be
extracted one piece at a time.

00:15:40.055 --> 00:15:42.770 align:middle line:84%
And for that reason, I'm
in direct communication

00:15:42.770 --> 00:15:46.020 align:middle line:84%
with the people who
wrote this statute.

00:15:46.020 --> 00:15:48.320 align:middle line:84%
I'm involved in
helping to nominate

00:15:48.320 --> 00:15:52.730 align:middle line:84%
the people who are going to
be on this nine-person board.

00:15:52.730 --> 00:15:56.030 align:middle line:84%
I have recommended that my
constitutional law professor

00:15:56.030 --> 00:15:59.360 align:middle line:84%
from Harvard, Larry
Tribe, Laurence Tribe,

00:15:59.360 --> 00:16:04.460 align:middle line:84%
be on this committee to protect
the constitutional integrity

00:16:04.460 --> 00:16:08.930 align:middle line:84%
of the Congress, to protect the
right of the people to know,

00:16:08.930 --> 00:16:12.260 align:middle line:84%
and to be able to advocate that
aggressively and effectively

00:16:12.260 --> 00:16:13.830 align:middle line:90%
inside the group.

00:16:13.830 --> 00:16:16.520 align:middle line:10%
And so what I wanted
to do is I wanted

00:16:16.520 --> 00:16:19.310 align:middle line:10%
to be able to
share with you some

00:16:19.310 --> 00:16:26.360 align:middle line:10%
of the particular provisions
of this, which might and will

00:16:26.360 --> 00:16:29.370 align:middle line:10%
undoubtedly surprise you.

00:16:29.370 --> 00:16:33.410 align:middle line:84%
The most important thing
about the whole bill

00:16:33.410 --> 00:16:37.610 align:middle line:84%
is that what it does is
it sets up this board.

00:16:37.610 --> 00:16:44.960 align:middle line:84%
It is called the UAP
or UFO Disclosure Act.

00:16:44.960 --> 00:16:47.700 align:middle line:90%
That's what this bill is.

00:16:47.700 --> 00:16:55.620 align:middle line:84%
And it sets up this board,
which is called the UFO or UAP

00:16:55.620 --> 00:16:57.810 align:middle line:90%
record review board.

00:16:57.810 --> 00:17:02.460 align:middle line:84%
And it's to review every single
record and every single piece

00:17:02.460 --> 00:17:06.010 align:middle line:84%
of material, whether
it's technology

00:17:06.010 --> 00:17:08.859 align:middle line:84%
or biological
evidence that has come

00:17:08.859 --> 00:17:11.290 align:middle line:84%
into the possession of the
United States government

00:17:11.290 --> 00:17:14.780 align:middle line:84%
or any agency of it or
any government contractor.

00:17:14.780 --> 00:17:20.800 align:middle line:84%
And they are asserting in
this statute eminent domain

00:17:20.800 --> 00:17:23.109 align:middle line:90%
over all of that property.

00:17:23.109 --> 00:17:25.810 align:middle line:84%
They are taking
custody of it away

00:17:25.810 --> 00:17:29.140 align:middle line:84%
from these private
contractors and putting it

00:17:29.140 --> 00:17:34.078 align:middle line:84%
into the hands of the
United States people.

00:17:34.078 --> 00:17:38.570 align:middle line:90%
And this board is charged with--

00:17:38.570 --> 00:17:43.490 align:middle line:90%
very importantly also getting--

00:17:43.490 --> 00:17:45.950 align:middle line:84%
they're going to
under this law, they

00:17:45.950 --> 00:17:48.230 align:middle line:84%
give every one of
these agencies.

00:17:48.230 --> 00:17:54.290 align:middle line:84%
The six military departments,
the 18 intelligence agencies,

00:17:54.290 --> 00:17:57.170 align:middle line:84%
the 32 defense
department agencies,

00:17:57.170 --> 00:17:59.090 align:middle line:84%
and all of these
private contractors,

00:17:59.090 --> 00:18:05.870 align:middle line:84%
they give each of them 300 days
from the seating of this panel

00:18:05.870 --> 00:18:09.440 align:middle line:84%
to gather all of that
information together that they

00:18:09.440 --> 00:18:13.850 align:middle line:84%
have acquired since
January 1st of 1945.

00:18:13.850 --> 00:18:17.870 align:middle line:84%
And put it into
digital form and have

00:18:17.870 --> 00:18:21.290 align:middle line:84%
it searchable to put
it into that form

00:18:21.290 --> 00:18:24.395 align:middle line:90%
and turn it over to the board.

00:18:24.395 --> 00:18:32.070 align:middle line:10%
And then that board
has to within 180 days

00:18:32.070 --> 00:18:35.510 align:middle line:10%
make public every
piece of information

00:18:35.510 --> 00:18:39.410 align:middle line:10%
that is more than 25 years old.

00:18:39.410 --> 00:18:41.630 align:middle line:84%
Which dates all the
way back to Roswell,

00:18:41.630 --> 00:18:45.500 align:middle line:84%
which dates all the way
back to White Sands.

00:18:45.500 --> 00:18:49.040 align:middle line:84%
It goes all the way
back to before 1998.

00:18:49.040 --> 00:18:52.340 align:middle line:84%
Every piece of information
that was acquired

00:18:52.340 --> 00:18:55.910 align:middle line:84%
by our government or any
of these people before 1998

00:18:55.910 --> 00:19:00.260 align:middle line:84%
has to be turned over and
made public within 180 days,

00:19:00.260 --> 00:19:03.680 align:middle line:84%
unless the President
of the United States

00:19:03.680 --> 00:19:09.100 align:middle line:84%
himself specifically
moves to postpone

00:19:09.100 --> 00:19:14.590 align:middle line:84%
the public revelation of that
particular piece of information.

00:19:14.590 --> 00:19:16.150 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:19:16.150 --> 00:19:18.700 align:middle line:10%
Now, each of the
agencies that I've

00:19:18.700 --> 00:19:21.910 align:middle line:10%
mentioned, the six United
States military services

00:19:21.910 --> 00:19:26.440 align:middle line:10%
and intelligence agencies
and et cetera, each of them,

00:19:26.440 --> 00:19:29.770 align:middle line:10%
when they proffer the
information to this board,

00:19:29.770 --> 00:19:36.700 align:middle line:10%
they can put in an application
to have information postponed

00:19:36.700 --> 00:19:38.560 align:middle line:10%
from public revelation.

00:19:38.560 --> 00:19:40.720 align:middle line:84%
Now all of us who have
been in Washington, D.C.

00:19:40.720 --> 00:19:42.868 align:middle line:10%
For 20 years or more
will know that they're

00:19:42.868 --> 00:19:44.410 align:middle line:10%
going to apply for
every single thing

00:19:44.410 --> 00:19:47.050 align:middle line:10%
they come up with
to be postponed.

00:19:47.050 --> 00:19:50.170 align:middle line:10%
And so this board
has to realize that,

00:19:50.170 --> 00:19:54.160 align:middle line:10%
so that in a sense, each
assertion of privacy that they

00:19:54.160 --> 00:19:56.470 align:middle line:10%
want to maintain over a
particular piece of information

00:19:56.470 --> 00:20:00.040 align:middle line:10%
is going to be
devalued for the fact

00:20:00.040 --> 00:20:02.860 align:middle line:10%
that they're doing it
for everything, which

00:20:02.860 --> 00:20:04.840 align:middle line:10%
is the same problem, the
same mistake they made

00:20:04.840 --> 00:20:06.700 align:middle line:10%
in the Pentagon Papers case.

00:20:06.700 --> 00:20:09.400 align:middle line:84%
Because they wouldn't designate
any particular thing that they

00:20:09.400 --> 00:20:10.400 align:middle line:90%
wanted to keep secret.

00:20:10.400 --> 00:20:13.905 align:middle line:84%
And so therefore, they lost
the whole kit and caboodle.

00:20:13.905 --> 00:20:16.040 align:middle line:84%
And so if they do
that in this case,

00:20:16.040 --> 00:20:18.290 align:middle line:84%
I can just tell you, the
lawyer for the New York Times

00:20:18.290 --> 00:20:22.220 align:middle line:84%
and the Pentagon Papers case is
going to be on the job to say,

00:20:22.220 --> 00:20:24.700 align:middle line:90%
OK, I've seen this before.

00:20:24.700 --> 00:20:27.650 align:middle line:84%
If you aren't going to
particularize a particular thing

00:20:27.650 --> 00:20:30.050 align:middle line:84%
and let the rest of
it become public,

00:20:30.050 --> 00:20:32.210 align:middle line:84%
we're going to beat you
flat out and it's all

00:20:32.210 --> 00:20:33.410 align:middle line:90%
going to be made public.

00:20:33.410 --> 00:20:36.890 align:middle line:10%
But they're going to have
to file that application

00:20:36.890 --> 00:20:39.580 align:middle line:10%
with the President
of the United States

00:20:39.580 --> 00:20:43.270 align:middle line:10%
to cover everything before 1998.

00:20:43.270 --> 00:20:45.680 align:middle line:10%
Otherwise, that information
has to be made public.

00:20:45.680 --> 00:20:48.010 align:middle line:10%
So that means that
the board itself

00:20:48.010 --> 00:20:50.350 align:middle line:10%
isn't even the one
that's going to decide

00:20:50.350 --> 00:20:54.220 align:middle line:10%
to OK that postponement.

00:20:54.220 --> 00:20:59.290 align:middle line:10%
Now with regard to everything
from 1998 up until the present,

00:20:59.290 --> 00:21:02.350 align:middle line:10%
that the board has to make
a decision whether they

00:21:02.350 --> 00:21:04.580 align:middle line:10%
agree with the postponement.

00:21:04.580 --> 00:21:07.100 align:middle line:10%
If they don't agree
with the postponement,

00:21:07.100 --> 00:21:09.590 align:middle line:10%
that information
has to be released

00:21:09.590 --> 00:21:11.920 align:middle line:10%
to the public within 180 days.

00:21:11.920 --> 00:21:17.810 align:middle line:10%
So that this period of 180 days
following the 300 days that all

00:21:17.810 --> 00:21:20.150 align:middle line:10%
the agencies get to
codify the information

00:21:20.150 --> 00:21:22.400 align:middle line:10%
and put it together in
digital form and make it

00:21:22.400 --> 00:21:25.920 align:middle line:10%
retrievable and all
that, that 180 days.

00:21:25.920 --> 00:21:30.590 align:middle line:10%
So you start from the time of
the sitting of this panel, 480

00:21:30.590 --> 00:21:34.890 align:middle line:10%
days, you can just
start counting 480 days,

00:21:34.890 --> 00:21:38.540 align:middle line:10%
just a ton of
information is going

00:21:38.540 --> 00:21:42.410 align:middle line:10%
to have to be revealed
to the American public,

00:21:42.410 --> 00:21:45.410 align:middle line:10%
unless the President
of the United States

00:21:45.410 --> 00:21:50.390 align:middle line:10%
has specifically postponed a
particular piece of information.

00:21:50.390 --> 00:21:53.480 align:middle line:10%
Now, very importantly,
everybody-- and this

00:21:53.480 --> 00:21:55.790 align:middle line:10%
is where Richard says,
yeah, well, they're

00:21:55.790 --> 00:21:58.280 align:middle line:10%
all going to try
to postpone it all.

00:21:58.280 --> 00:22:03.060 align:middle line:10%
What it says is that any piece
of information that is postponed

00:22:03.060 --> 00:22:06.080 align:middle line:10%
has to go into a special file.

00:22:06.080 --> 00:22:10.460 align:middle line:10%
And this board has to design
and give it to the president

00:22:10.460 --> 00:22:18.500 align:middle line:10%
governing that information a UFO
controlled disclosure campaign

00:22:18.500 --> 00:22:20.610 align:middle line:10%
plan.

00:22:20.610 --> 00:22:26.240 align:middle line:10%
So that means that they have to
make that information public.

00:22:26.240 --> 00:22:28.670 align:middle line:10%
In addition to the other
information that has already

00:22:28.670 --> 00:22:31.550 align:middle line:10%
been made public in
the first 180 days,

00:22:31.550 --> 00:22:34.280 align:middle line:10%
they have to reveal
all of that information

00:22:34.280 --> 00:22:38.150 align:middle line:10%
pursuant to a specific
disclosure program.

00:22:38.150 --> 00:22:41.090 align:middle line:10%
So what we have, what
this statute is doing

00:22:41.090 --> 00:22:47.060 align:middle line:10%
is creating a presidentially
administered disclosure

00:22:47.060 --> 00:22:50.600 align:middle line:10%
program on the
UFO phenomenon and

00:22:50.600 --> 00:22:53.710 align:middle line:10%
extraterrestrial intelligence.

00:22:53.710 --> 00:22:56.960 align:middle line:10%
And people would say,
well, how long a period

00:22:56.960 --> 00:22:59.810 align:middle line:10%
can they postpone this?

00:22:59.810 --> 00:23:06.840 align:middle line:10%
There's a sunset clause in this
statute of seven years, which

00:23:06.840 --> 00:23:11.850 align:middle line:10%
means that the administration
that is elected in November

00:23:11.850 --> 00:23:18.440 align:middle line:10%
of 2024, a year from now,
basically, that administration,

00:23:18.440 --> 00:23:24.350 align:middle line:10%
that four-year period, and then
the three years of the following

00:23:24.350 --> 00:23:27.050 align:middle line:10%
administration, that's
when the disclosures

00:23:27.050 --> 00:23:31.210 align:middle line:10%
all during that period
of time has to be made.

00:23:31.210 --> 00:23:35.970 align:middle line:10%
Now people will say, why
should we wait seven years?

00:23:35.970 --> 00:23:39.040 align:middle line:10%
We're going to try to keep it
a lot less than seven years.

00:23:39.040 --> 00:23:40.150 align:middle line:10%
That's our job.

00:23:40.150 --> 00:23:43.210 align:middle line:10%
The new Paradigm
Institute has the offices.

00:23:43.210 --> 00:23:47.280 align:middle line:10%
We have the only civilian office
inside the federal enclave

00:23:47.280 --> 00:23:50.680 align:middle line:10%
on Capitol Hill, the
new Paradigm Institute.

00:23:50.680 --> 00:23:53.250 align:middle line:84%
We have the offices that
are immediately adjacent

00:23:53.250 --> 00:23:55.530 align:middle line:84%
to the Senate
Intelligence building

00:23:55.530 --> 00:23:58.740 align:middle line:84%
and between them and the
United States Supreme Court.

00:23:58.740 --> 00:24:00.988 align:middle line:84%
And we are there meeting
every day with people

00:24:00.988 --> 00:24:03.030 align:middle line:84%
from the Senate Intelligence
committee, the House

00:24:03.030 --> 00:24:05.488 align:middle line:84%
Intelligence committee, the
House Armed Services committee,

00:24:05.488 --> 00:24:06.420 align:middle line:90%
et cetera.

00:24:06.420 --> 00:24:09.930 align:middle line:84%
And we are the ones
who are also nominating

00:24:09.930 --> 00:24:12.060 align:middle line:90%
the people to be on this board.

00:24:12.060 --> 00:24:14.340 align:middle line:84%
So what we're going
to be trying to do

00:24:14.340 --> 00:24:18.030 align:middle line:84%
is to try to accelerate
the revelation,

00:24:18.030 --> 00:24:20.790 align:middle line:84%
the public revelation
of this information

00:24:20.790 --> 00:24:24.950 align:middle line:90%
to the greatest extent possible.

00:24:24.950 --> 00:24:27.293 align:middle line:10%
And very importantly,
another task

00:24:27.293 --> 00:24:28.710 align:middle line:10%
that we're going
to be performing,

00:24:28.710 --> 00:24:32.710 align:middle line:10%
the New Paradigm Institute is
when the information is released

00:24:32.710 --> 00:24:37.030 align:middle line:10%
by them, we are going to be
combing through it in detail

00:24:37.030 --> 00:24:41.620 align:middle line:10%
and putting it into a format
to make public to everybody

00:24:41.620 --> 00:24:44.770 align:middle line:10%
so that it can be
easily understood

00:24:44.770 --> 00:24:47.020 align:middle line:10%
and can be researched.

00:24:47.020 --> 00:24:49.150 align:middle line:10%
And we can attach
appendices to it

00:24:49.150 --> 00:24:51.700 align:middle line:10%
that you'll have the
original actual documents,

00:24:51.700 --> 00:24:56.570 align:middle line:10%
and you'll have a summation of
it with footnotes and details.

00:24:56.570 --> 00:24:59.590 align:middle line:10%
That's what our staff
is going to be doing.

00:24:59.590 --> 00:25:03.220 align:middle line:10%
So we are going to be the
people's advocate with regard

00:25:03.220 --> 00:25:08.020 align:middle line:10%
to this information and get this
information out to the public.

00:25:08.020 --> 00:25:10.690 align:middle line:10%
And we're also going
to be going back in

00:25:10.690 --> 00:25:14.380 align:middle line:10%
to try to extract whatever
information has already

00:25:14.380 --> 00:25:15.880 align:middle line:10%
been postponed.

00:25:15.880 --> 00:25:17.560 align:middle line:10%
Now, what that's
going to do is it's

00:25:17.560 --> 00:25:21.250 align:middle line:10%
going to confront us with this
fundamental question, which

00:25:21.250 --> 00:25:24.220 align:middle line:10%
we want to have some
discussion about tonight.

00:25:24.220 --> 00:25:29.080 align:middle line:10%
And that is, is there
any credence at all

00:25:29.080 --> 00:25:33.010 align:middle line:10%
to their argument that
there is information here

00:25:33.010 --> 00:25:37.570 align:middle line:10%
that needs to be concealed from
the American public and the rest

00:25:37.570 --> 00:25:39.850 align:middle line:10%
of the world?

00:25:39.850 --> 00:25:43.960 align:middle line:10%
Now, obviously, people in what
they call the legacy group that

00:25:43.960 --> 00:25:45.610 align:middle line:10%
has been holding on
to this information

00:25:45.610 --> 00:25:48.310 align:middle line:10%
and lying about it
for all these decades

00:25:48.310 --> 00:25:53.560 align:middle line:10%
has all kinds of ideas as to why
it is so catastrophic to reveal

00:25:53.560 --> 00:25:54.693 align:middle line:10%
this information.

00:25:54.693 --> 00:25:56.860 align:middle line:10%
But they're the same people
that said the same thing

00:25:56.860 --> 00:25:59.020 align:middle line:10%
about the Pentagon papers.

00:25:59.020 --> 00:26:00.470 align:middle line:90%
And it just isn't true.

00:26:00.470 --> 00:26:02.140 align:middle line:84%
So what we're going
to be doing is

00:26:02.140 --> 00:26:04.870 align:middle line:84%
we're going to be, in
a sense, litigating

00:26:04.870 --> 00:26:08.560 align:middle line:84%
against them to try to
drive that information

00:26:08.560 --> 00:26:10.430 align:middle line:90%
to the absolute minimum.

00:26:10.430 --> 00:26:13.360 align:middle line:10%
And we're going to
try to determine

00:26:13.360 --> 00:26:18.100 align:middle line:10%
what it is that they're
using for their rationale

00:26:18.100 --> 00:26:20.720 align:middle line:10%
to try to keep it secret.

00:26:20.720 --> 00:26:23.370 align:middle line:10%
And then we have
to evaluate that.

00:26:23.370 --> 00:26:25.040 align:middle line:84%
Now all of that,
we're going to be

00:26:25.040 --> 00:26:31.980 align:middle line:84%
doing by refusing to accept
any security clearances.

00:26:31.980 --> 00:26:35.940 align:middle line:10%
We're not going to do that
because if you accept a security

00:26:35.940 --> 00:26:38.100 align:middle line:10%
clearance, they're
going to try to put you

00:26:38.100 --> 00:26:41.310 align:middle line:10%
in prison for every single
piece of information

00:26:41.310 --> 00:26:44.370 align:middle line:10%
you put out that they don't
want people to know about.

00:26:44.370 --> 00:26:45.870 align:middle line:10%
And they're going
to insist that you

00:26:45.870 --> 00:26:49.230 align:middle line:10%
got that information because
you had the security clearance.

00:26:49.230 --> 00:26:51.100 align:middle line:10%
And that isn't true.

00:26:51.100 --> 00:26:53.010 align:middle line:84%
I can tell you it's
kind of a strange story.

00:26:53.010 --> 00:27:00.030 align:middle line:84%
But when we were doing the
Iran-Contra case, Bob Fink,

00:27:00.030 --> 00:27:02.790 align:middle line:84%
who was the investigator
for Bella Abzug.

00:27:02.790 --> 00:27:07.080 align:middle line:84%
Bella was the United States
Congressperson from Manhattan.

00:27:07.080 --> 00:27:10.500 align:middle line:84%
And she chaired the
House Judiciary Committee

00:27:10.500 --> 00:27:11.770 align:middle line:90%
on Individual Rights.

00:27:11.770 --> 00:27:16.010 align:middle line:84%
And he was her investigator
during the Church Committee

00:27:16.010 --> 00:27:16.810 align:middle line:90%
hearings.

00:27:16.810 --> 00:27:19.710 align:middle line:84%
And he said, look,
do not ever, ever,

00:27:19.710 --> 00:27:22.230 align:middle line:84%
ever agree to take
a security clearance

00:27:22.230 --> 00:27:24.210 align:middle line:84%
because you, Danny,
he said, I've

00:27:24.210 --> 00:27:25.710 align:middle line:84%
worked with you now
for a long time.

00:27:25.710 --> 00:27:28.560 align:middle line:84%
I know that you can find
out virtually anything

00:27:28.560 --> 00:27:30.300 align:middle line:90%
you want to find out about.

00:27:30.300 --> 00:27:33.520 align:middle line:84%
And you don't want to have a
security clearance, so that you

00:27:33.520 --> 00:27:37.090 align:middle line:84%
can then remain free to
tell the people about what

00:27:37.090 --> 00:27:39.280 align:middle line:90%
it is that you have found out.

00:27:39.280 --> 00:27:42.160 align:middle line:84%
And that is the principle
that we're following.

00:27:42.160 --> 00:27:44.360 align:middle line:84%
We're not going to take
a security clearance.

00:27:44.360 --> 00:27:47.290 align:middle line:84%
We're going to dig in
and get this information.

00:27:47.290 --> 00:27:51.580 align:middle line:84%
We're going to get contributions
from people around the country

00:27:51.580 --> 00:27:53.870 align:middle line:84%
to be able to hire
the proper staff.

00:27:53.870 --> 00:27:58.090 align:middle line:84%
We've hired people that are
very, very knowledgeable.

00:27:58.090 --> 00:28:00.220 align:middle line:84%
People who do have
security clearances,

00:28:00.220 --> 00:28:03.190 align:middle line:84%
in point of fact,
who are able to get

00:28:03.190 --> 00:28:05.090 align:middle line:90%
at all kinds of information.

00:28:05.090 --> 00:28:08.020 align:middle line:10%
And they will be
exercising their judgment

00:28:08.020 --> 00:28:11.050 align:middle line:10%
about what it is
that they can tell us

00:28:11.050 --> 00:28:14.620 align:middle line:10%
while still preserving their
national security clearances.

00:28:14.620 --> 00:28:16.990 align:middle line:84%
And so we are going
to have access

00:28:16.990 --> 00:28:18.940 align:middle line:90%
to that kind of information.

00:28:18.940 --> 00:28:20.260 align:middle line:90%
All right.

00:28:20.260 --> 00:28:27.550 align:middle line:10%
And so that in addition to
those particular activities

00:28:27.550 --> 00:28:29.770 align:middle line:10%
that they're going to
have, it's very important

00:28:29.770 --> 00:28:38.470 align:middle line:10%
to understand that this statute
gives to this board subpoena

00:28:38.470 --> 00:28:41.030 align:middle line:10%
power.

00:28:41.030 --> 00:28:43.640 align:middle line:84%
Now, it's a little
strange, but it's

00:28:43.640 --> 00:28:46.700 align:middle line:84%
what they have the right to
do under this statute is apply

00:28:46.700 --> 00:28:49.520 align:middle line:84%
to the attorney general
of the United States

00:28:49.520 --> 00:28:51.890 align:middle line:84%
to have the attorney
general of the United States

00:28:51.890 --> 00:28:57.300 align:middle line:84%
go to a federal district court
and get the court to affirm

00:28:57.300 --> 00:29:00.430 align:middle line:90%
the subpoena from this board.

00:29:00.430 --> 00:29:03.400 align:middle line:10%
Now, one of our jobs at
the New Paradigm Institute

00:29:03.400 --> 00:29:07.870 align:middle line:10%
is to try to streamline that
process as much as possible so

00:29:07.870 --> 00:29:09.470 align:middle line:10%
that it doesn't just drag out.

00:29:09.470 --> 00:29:12.130 align:middle line:10%
This just isn't a way of
obfuscating and pushing back

00:29:12.130 --> 00:29:12.930 align:middle line:10%
against us.

00:29:12.930 --> 00:29:15.010 align:middle line:10%
We want to set up a
streamlined process

00:29:15.010 --> 00:29:18.020 align:middle line:10%
by means of which the
subpoena can be issued.

00:29:18.020 --> 00:29:19.570 align:middle line:10%
It can go to the
attorney general.

00:29:19.570 --> 00:29:21.370 align:middle line:10%
It can go to the
court right away

00:29:21.370 --> 00:29:26.550 align:middle line:10%
and get this on a fast track
to get rulings from the court

00:29:26.550 --> 00:29:31.210 align:middle line:10%
to speed this process up so that
they can exercise their power

00:29:31.210 --> 00:29:34.570 align:middle line:10%
to extract this information
not only from the government

00:29:34.570 --> 00:29:38.500 align:middle line:10%
agencies, but very importantly
from the private contractors.

00:29:38.500 --> 00:29:42.490 align:middle line:84%
So that, that issue
of the exercise

00:29:42.490 --> 00:29:47.020 align:middle line:84%
of eminent domain by taking
official custody and ownership

00:29:47.020 --> 00:29:50.200 align:middle line:84%
of all that information
and the subpoena power

00:29:50.200 --> 00:29:53.500 align:middle line:84%
to go and get the information
and hold them in contempt

00:29:53.500 --> 00:29:55.930 align:middle line:84%
of court if they
don't give it to you

00:29:55.930 --> 00:29:59.960 align:middle line:84%
are powerful tools of
this particular statute.

00:29:59.960 --> 00:30:04.080 align:middle line:84%
Therefore, it shouldn't
be too surprising--

00:30:04.080 --> 00:30:08.480 align:middle line:84%
it shouldn't be too surprising
that those particular portions

00:30:08.480 --> 00:30:11.750 align:middle line:84%
of this particular
statute now are starting

00:30:11.750 --> 00:30:14.920 align:middle line:90%
to generate some opposition.

00:30:14.920 --> 00:30:22.330 align:middle line:84%
For example, the chairman of the
House Intelligence Committee,

00:30:22.330 --> 00:30:23.950 align:middle line:90%
his name is Michael Turner.

00:30:23.950 --> 00:30:27.410 align:middle line:10%
He is from the 10th
district in Ohio,

00:30:27.410 --> 00:30:28.850 align:middle line:10%
the 10th congressional district.

00:30:28.850 --> 00:30:32.140 align:middle line:84%
It is the home of
Wright-Patterson Air Force

00:30:32.140 --> 00:30:39.421 align:middle line:84%
Base, the place to which the
UFO from Roswell was taken.

00:30:39.421 --> 00:30:41.440 align:middle line:84%
And we also are
getting some opposition

00:30:41.440 --> 00:30:45.550 align:middle line:84%
from Michael Rogers, who is
the chair of the House Armed

00:30:45.550 --> 00:30:47.500 align:middle line:90%
Services Committee.

00:30:47.500 --> 00:30:50.290 align:middle line:84%
He comes from the third
congressional district

00:30:50.290 --> 00:30:54.520 align:middle line:84%
in Alabama, which is right next
door to the Redstone rocket

00:30:54.520 --> 00:30:55.750 align:middle line:90%
missile range.

00:30:55.750 --> 00:30:58.990 align:middle line:10%
And it is the major
facility where

00:30:58.990 --> 00:31:02.470 align:middle line:10%
they are trying to
apply technology

00:31:02.470 --> 00:31:08.350 align:middle line:10%
from the back engineered UFOs
to develop a super missile that

00:31:08.350 --> 00:31:12.820 align:middle line:10%
can travel at supersonic
speeds like the UFOs,

00:31:12.820 --> 00:31:17.420 align:middle line:10%
so they can make a missile that
can be launched against China

00:31:17.420 --> 00:31:21.410 align:middle line:10%
or Russia or whoever
the enemy of this period

00:31:21.410 --> 00:31:24.740 align:middle line:10%
is that can't be stopped.

00:31:24.740 --> 00:31:27.740 align:middle line:10%
And so that we have these
two particular individuals--

00:31:27.740 --> 00:31:31.580 align:middle line:10%
Michael Turner from the
10th district of Ohio,

00:31:31.580 --> 00:31:34.820 align:middle line:10%
and we have Michael Rogers,
the chairman of the House Armed

00:31:34.820 --> 00:31:38.670 align:middle line:10%
Services Committee from the
third district in Alabama.

00:31:38.670 --> 00:31:44.620 align:middle line:10%
These are two people that all
of you should call every single

00:31:44.620 --> 00:31:49.600 align:middle line:10%
friend you have, every single
family member that you have who

00:31:49.600 --> 00:31:55.660 align:middle line:10%
come from the 10th congressional
district in Ohio and/or

00:31:55.660 --> 00:32:00.730 align:middle line:10%
the third congressional district
in Alabama and have them write

00:32:00.730 --> 00:32:07.210 align:middle line:10%
to their Congressman and insist
that this Schumer bill be left

00:32:07.210 --> 00:32:11.140 align:middle line:10%
intact in the Conference
Committee between the House

00:32:11.140 --> 00:32:13.370 align:middle line:10%
and the Senate.

00:32:13.370 --> 00:32:17.350 align:middle line:10%
It's a very specific ask
that I'm asking here.

00:32:17.350 --> 00:32:22.600 align:middle line:10%
This is homework that you have,
and that I want to be interested

00:32:22.600 --> 00:32:25.450 align:middle line:10%
that while it's
entertaining to come

00:32:25.450 --> 00:32:29.630 align:middle line:10%
to an event like this on the
weekend, it's informative.

00:32:29.630 --> 00:32:30.710 align:middle line:10%
It's interesting.

00:32:30.710 --> 00:32:34.660 align:middle line:10%
But the fact of the matter is
that we as the American people

00:32:34.660 --> 00:32:37.810 align:middle line:10%
are in a unique position
in the whole world

00:32:37.810 --> 00:32:41.350 align:middle line:10%
as only the 4.3% of the
people in the population

00:32:41.350 --> 00:32:45.070 align:middle line:10%
of the whole planet who
have the kind of power that

00:32:45.070 --> 00:32:49.930 align:middle line:10%
can force these people to
turn over this information

00:32:49.930 --> 00:32:52.370 align:middle line:10%
and be able to make it public.

00:32:52.370 --> 00:32:55.870 align:middle line:84%
And so that you
have to do some work

00:32:55.870 --> 00:32:58.540 align:middle line:84%
and you have to get your
family and your friends

00:32:58.540 --> 00:32:59.570 align:middle line:90%
to do some work.

00:32:59.570 --> 00:33:05.530 align:middle line:10%
The reality is, is that almost
everybody with a political IQ

00:33:05.530 --> 00:33:10.330 align:middle line:10%
above room temperature is
excited about this issue now.

00:33:10.330 --> 00:33:12.300 align:middle line:10%
They're saying, Holy shit.

00:33:12.300 --> 00:33:14.150 align:middle line:10%
You mean it's real?

00:33:14.150 --> 00:33:16.820 align:middle line:10%
After all this time of
people rolling their eyes

00:33:16.820 --> 00:33:20.640 align:middle line:10%
and doing the tinfoil hat thing
with the antennas that you mean

00:33:20.640 --> 00:33:21.930 align:middle line:10%
this is real?

00:33:21.930 --> 00:33:23.640 align:middle line:10%
The answer is yes.

00:33:23.640 --> 00:33:25.820 align:middle line:10%
This is real.

00:33:25.820 --> 00:33:28.820 align:middle line:10%
And so what I want
to do that we have

00:33:28.820 --> 00:33:30.950 align:middle line:10%
here tonight, in
addition to asking

00:33:30.950 --> 00:33:33.895 align:middle line:10%
you to do that, there are--

00:33:33.895 --> 00:33:35.520 align:middle line:10%
just so that we'll
have a record of it.

00:33:35.520 --> 00:33:37.550 align:middle line:10%
That's why I've asked
the guys to make sure

00:33:37.550 --> 00:33:39.860 align:middle line:10%
that the video on
this is done well

00:33:39.860 --> 00:33:42.980 align:middle line:10%
is that there are a few other
people that I want to put on

00:33:42.980 --> 00:33:44.820 align:middle line:10%
the record here for you.

00:33:44.820 --> 00:33:48.260 align:middle line:10%
So get a copy of this because
it's going to be hard for you

00:33:48.260 --> 00:33:51.200 align:middle line:10%
to remember because you didn't
bring your pen and notepads,

00:33:51.200 --> 00:33:54.470 align:middle line:10%
what have you, is that you want
to get not only Mike Turner from

00:33:54.470 --> 00:34:01.060 align:middle line:10%
the 10th CD in Ohio, you want to
get Scott Austin from the eighth

00:34:01.060 --> 00:34:03.330 align:middle line:10%
congressional
district in Georgia.

00:34:03.330 --> 00:34:06.500 align:middle line:10%
He's in South Central
Georgia where--

00:34:06.500 --> 00:34:07.879 align:middle line:10%
Macon, Georgia.

00:34:07.879 --> 00:34:08.679 align:middle line:10%
OK.

00:34:08.679 --> 00:34:12.639 align:middle line:10%
He's on the House Armed
Services Committee.

00:34:12.639 --> 00:34:15.380 align:middle line:84%
And he's also on the House
Intelligence Committee.

00:34:15.380 --> 00:34:18.730 align:middle line:84%
So he's on the committee that
both of these other guys chair

00:34:18.730 --> 00:34:21.590 align:middle line:84%
that are trying to
resist this bill.

00:34:21.590 --> 00:34:24.980 align:middle line:84%
You also want to get a
hold of Elise Stefanik.

00:34:24.980 --> 00:34:27.930 align:middle line:84%
She's out of the 21st
congressional district in New

00:34:27.930 --> 00:34:28.730 align:middle line:90%
York.

00:34:28.730 --> 00:34:31.540 align:middle line:10%
That's up in Lake George,
up in the Adirondacks,

00:34:31.540 --> 00:34:33.969 align:middle line:10%
up in Glens Falls and
Albany and Saratoga

00:34:33.969 --> 00:34:36.383 align:middle line:10%
up there, that call
all your friends.

00:34:36.383 --> 00:34:37.550 align:middle line:10%
I happen to come from there.

00:34:37.550 --> 00:34:39.310 align:middle line:10%
I haven't been born
in Glens Falls.

00:34:39.310 --> 00:34:41.620 align:middle line:10%
So I'm calling all
of my relatives

00:34:41.620 --> 00:34:43.060 align:middle line:10%
who are going to
say oh, no, here

00:34:43.060 --> 00:34:45.040 align:middle line:10%
comes Danny with another one.

00:34:45.040 --> 00:34:48.650 align:middle line:10%
But anyway, then there's
also Trent Kelly.

00:34:48.650 --> 00:34:51.560 align:middle line:10%
He's in the 1st congressional
district of Mississippi.

00:34:51.560 --> 00:34:54.130 align:middle line:10%
That's down in
Oxford, Mississippi,

00:34:54.130 --> 00:34:57.730 align:middle line:10%
where Ole Miss is in Tupelo.

00:34:57.730 --> 00:35:01.790 align:middle line:10%
And then there is
Mike Gallagher in

00:35:01.790 --> 00:35:04.010 align:middle line:10%
the eighth
congressional district

00:35:04.010 --> 00:35:06.320 align:middle line:10%
in Green Bay, Wisconsin.

00:35:06.320 --> 00:35:08.840 align:middle line:10%
These are specific
people that I want

00:35:08.840 --> 00:35:14.450 align:middle line:10%
you to find out who lives
in those particular areas

00:35:14.450 --> 00:35:17.885 align:middle line:10%
and get them to
call these people.

00:35:17.885 --> 00:35:20.540 align:middle line:10%
And what they're going to say,
I can tell you when they say,

00:35:20.540 --> 00:35:23.960 align:middle line:10%
wait a second, somebody from
Glens Falls is calling me,

00:35:23.960 --> 00:35:27.620 align:middle line:10%
telling us that they want us to
keep the Schumer bill intact.

00:35:27.620 --> 00:35:30.780 align:middle line:10%
Holy mackerel, I'd better
pay more attention to this.

00:35:30.780 --> 00:35:34.410 align:middle line:84%
I can tell you that's how
this democracy works here.

00:35:34.410 --> 00:35:38.720 align:middle line:84%
So what I'm saying is that we've
got to get busy on this thing.

00:35:38.720 --> 00:35:40.920 align:middle line:84%
This is an extraordinarily
important moment.

00:35:40.920 --> 00:35:43.700 align:middle line:84%
Most everybody here
has spent years

00:35:43.700 --> 00:35:45.680 align:middle line:84%
interested in this
particular subject,

00:35:45.680 --> 00:35:48.110 align:middle line:84%
or you wouldn't have come all
the way here to this thing.

00:35:48.110 --> 00:35:51.320 align:middle line:84%
And so that what this is,
is some specific details

00:35:51.320 --> 00:35:52.350 align:middle line:90%
that you can do.

00:35:52.350 --> 00:35:53.430 align:middle line:90%
It's not hard.

00:35:53.430 --> 00:35:54.870 align:middle line:90%
It's not really hard.

00:35:54.870 --> 00:35:58.070 align:middle line:90%
It's like a little salon.

00:35:58.070 --> 00:36:00.260 align:middle line:84%
You could actually
convene a little salon

00:36:00.260 --> 00:36:04.100 align:middle line:84%
or like a book club
with your friends.

00:36:04.100 --> 00:36:07.220 align:middle line:84%
Get them Richard's
two volume work

00:36:07.220 --> 00:36:09.942 align:middle line:84%
of the UFOs and the
national security state

00:36:09.942 --> 00:36:11.900 align:middle line:84%
and go through it with
them and say, Holy shit,

00:36:11.900 --> 00:36:13.380 align:middle line:90%
I didn't know this was true.

00:36:13.380 --> 00:36:15.470 align:middle line:84%
And look at their private
documents in here,

00:36:15.470 --> 00:36:16.710 align:middle line:90%
there's the twining letter.

00:36:16.710 --> 00:36:19.753 align:middle line:84%
He was the commander of the
United States Air Force.

00:36:19.753 --> 00:36:21.170 align:middle line:84%
He wrote a letter
to the president

00:36:21.170 --> 00:36:23.010 align:middle line:90%
saying these UFOs are real.

00:36:23.010 --> 00:36:24.210 align:middle line:90%
They're metallic vehicles.

00:36:24.210 --> 00:36:25.293 align:middle line:90%
They're flying all around.

00:36:25.293 --> 00:36:27.650 align:middle line:84%
And we think they're
extraterrestrial.

00:36:27.650 --> 00:36:31.940 align:middle line:90%
And that's in 1948 or something.

00:36:31.940 --> 00:36:35.030 align:middle line:84%
So what I'm saying is
that you can do this.

00:36:35.030 --> 00:36:36.930 align:middle line:90%
It's not hard work.

00:36:36.930 --> 00:36:38.360 align:middle line:90%
It can be entertaining.

00:36:38.360 --> 00:36:39.590 align:middle line:90%
It can be fun.

00:36:39.590 --> 00:36:42.890 align:middle line:90%
And it can help save the world.

00:36:42.890 --> 00:36:46.540 align:middle line:90%

00:36:46.540 --> 00:36:50.000 align:middle line:90%
