00:00:10.868 --> 00:00:14.590 align:middle line:90%
>> So how powerful are humans?

00:00:14.590 --> 00:00:19.450 align:middle line:10%
They are what's creating
this reality that we're in.

00:00:19.450 --> 00:00:25.030 align:middle line:10%
That's why some media outlets
understand this concept.

00:00:25.030 --> 00:00:29.920 align:middle line:10%
And by altering the human
belief, they alter reality.

00:00:29.920 --> 00:00:34.975 align:middle line:84%
You actually do-- basically
create your reality by--

00:00:34.975 --> 00:00:40.580 align:middle line:84%
based on what you're creating
through your own mind.

00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:43.660 align:middle line:84%
So what happens is
you see something,

00:00:43.660 --> 00:00:47.840 align:middle line:84%
goes through your eyes and works
with your own pineal gland.

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:53.120 align:middle line:84%
And you render the reality that
reflects your internal world.

00:00:53.120 --> 00:00:56.740 align:middle line:84%
So you can actually manipulate
your internal world.

00:00:56.740 --> 00:00:59.560 align:middle line:84%
And that manipulates
your external world.

00:00:59.560 --> 00:01:02.530 align:middle line:90%
It really is that simple.

00:01:02.530 --> 00:01:05.890 align:middle line:84%
Everything really
is that simple.

00:01:05.890 --> 00:01:08.710 align:middle line:84%
But according to all
these extraterrestrials

00:01:08.710 --> 00:01:12.080 align:middle line:84%
that speak through
my clients, they

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:16.700 align:middle line:84%
have said that the future
of humanity is like this.

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:20.720 align:middle line:84%
This is the most recent stuff
that comes through my sessions.

00:01:20.720 --> 00:01:23.750 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I know I am
a little bit weird.

00:01:23.750 --> 00:01:27.980 align:middle line:84%
But this is what has been coming
through, that right now humanity

00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:29.900 align:middle line:90%
has multiple timelines.

00:01:29.900 --> 00:01:31.250 align:middle line:90%
You might notice this.

00:01:31.250 --> 00:01:34.610 align:middle line:84%
You might feel like you're on
a totally different timeline

00:01:34.610 --> 00:01:35.550 align:middle line:90%
than someone else.

00:01:35.550 --> 00:01:37.190 align:middle line:90%
And that's because you are.

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:40.070 align:middle line:84%
Your reality is
literally that different

00:01:40.070 --> 00:01:43.160 align:middle line:84%
because your external
reality is a reflection

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:44.690 align:middle line:90%
of your internal reality.

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:47.100 align:middle line:84%
And it might be different
than someone else's.

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:50.540 align:middle line:84%
So right now, humanity has
many different timelines.

00:01:50.540 --> 00:01:54.470 align:middle line:84%
But we're predicted
to hit a nexus point.

00:01:54.470 --> 00:01:56.870 align:middle line:10%
And this is not a scary thing.

00:01:56.870 --> 00:01:59.890 align:middle line:10%
This nexus point could
be many different things.

00:01:59.890 --> 00:02:04.490 align:middle line:84%
But one of the predicted nexus
points that comes through a lot

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:11.090 align:middle line:84%
is if the comet or a
comet has a tail that

00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:15.890 align:middle line:84%
goes in front of the sun, it
might trigger a coronal mass

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:18.470 align:middle line:90%
ejection or solar activity.

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:23.520 align:middle line:10%
And what might happen is that
might weaken our toroidal field,

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:26.330 align:middle line:10%
dropping the veil
for a little while.

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:31.250 align:middle line:10%
Now, if our veil is
dropped, everyone

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:34.580 align:middle line:10%
will see into different
dimensions all of a sudden.

00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:37.640 align:middle line:84%
And they will see more of
the nature of our reality.

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:39.830 align:middle line:84%
Now, think of your
friends that are

00:02:39.830 --> 00:02:43.250 align:middle line:84%
totally not into
aliens, all of a sudden,

00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:46.130 align:middle line:90%
seeing every type of alien.

00:02:46.130 --> 00:02:53.510 align:middle line:84%
They might not have a good
time but some people might.

00:02:53.510 --> 00:02:58.460 align:middle line:84%
So after this nexus point
and if that one happens--

00:02:58.460 --> 00:03:03.950 align:middle line:84%
it might not because I never
get told what will happen.

00:03:03.950 --> 00:03:07.610 align:middle line:10%
I get told what might
happen because reality

00:03:07.610 --> 00:03:09.950 align:middle line:10%
keeps changing all the time.

00:03:09.950 --> 00:03:13.260 align:middle line:84%
And it does change according
to your own belief system.

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:15.380 align:middle line:84%
But after we hit
the nexus point,

00:03:15.380 --> 00:03:17.570 align:middle line:84%
all these extraterrestrials
have told me

00:03:17.570 --> 00:03:20.360 align:middle line:84%
we have three
timelines after that.

00:03:20.360 --> 00:03:23.540 align:middle line:84%
This is the most probable
future they have said.

00:03:23.540 --> 00:03:28.370 align:middle line:84%
Now, the highest timeline
looks freaking amazing.

00:03:28.370 --> 00:03:31.970 align:middle line:84%
Extraterrestrials come and
help us clean up our waters.

00:03:31.970 --> 00:03:35.300 align:middle line:84%
They actually come live amongst
us and start teaching us.

00:03:35.300 --> 00:03:39.110 align:middle line:84%
People stop wearing
fake human suits.

00:03:39.110 --> 00:03:41.210 align:middle line:84%
And they're just their
extraterrestrial selves.

00:03:41.210 --> 00:03:44.510 align:middle line:84%
Like your friends who are
super extraterrestrial,

00:03:44.510 --> 00:03:46.490 align:middle line:84%
they won't be in a
human body anymore.

00:03:46.490 --> 00:03:49.670 align:middle line:84%
They're going to be their
true extraterrestrial self.

00:03:49.670 --> 00:03:54.680 align:middle line:84%
And, oh my gosh, we teach our
children in these new schools

00:03:54.680 --> 00:03:57.650 align:middle line:84%
all about the real
nature of reality.

00:03:57.650 --> 00:04:00.140 align:middle line:84%
And we get rid of all
these old programs.

00:04:00.140 --> 00:04:03.260 align:middle line:84%
We all of a sudden
speak telepathically.

00:04:03.260 --> 00:04:06.410 align:middle line:84%
And there's so much love
we have for one another.

00:04:06.410 --> 00:04:08.790 align:middle line:84%
We build these
amazing communities.

00:04:08.790 --> 00:04:12.260 align:middle line:84%
And it's just an amazing
ascension for humanity.

00:04:12.260 --> 00:04:16.670 align:middle line:84%
Now, the middle timeline
right now is not so awesome.

00:04:16.670 --> 00:04:20.630 align:middle line:84%
It is the same trajectory
that the greys went down.

00:04:20.630 --> 00:04:24.050 align:middle line:84%
So the middle version
of this timeline

00:04:24.050 --> 00:04:27.560 align:middle line:84%
goes really far advanced
with technology.

00:04:27.560 --> 00:04:32.370 align:middle line:84%
Eventually, they have
to mutate themselves.

00:04:32.370 --> 00:04:35.450 align:middle line:84%
They try to breed out
emotions for efficiency

00:04:35.450 --> 00:04:39.500 align:middle line:84%
and go super high with their
technology, lose the planet,

00:04:39.500 --> 00:04:41.870 align:middle line:84%
have to live aboard
ships for the millennia,

00:04:41.870 --> 00:04:45.710 align:middle line:84%
and then try to come into an
alternate version of reality

00:04:45.710 --> 00:04:49.130 align:middle line:84%
and high jump another
universe like the Greys did

00:04:49.130 --> 00:04:51.410 align:middle line:90%
in this reality.

00:04:51.410 --> 00:04:54.980 align:middle line:90%
But the negative timeline ends.

00:04:54.980 --> 00:04:59.270 align:middle line:84%
So there is a contract right now
that the negative timeline will

00:04:59.270 --> 00:05:04.740 align:middle line:84%
not be able to be in this planet
because this planet is ascending

00:05:04.740 --> 00:05:05.540 align:middle line:90%
too.

00:05:05.540 --> 00:05:09.030 align:middle line:84%
So the negative timeline-- and
you can't get any of this wrong,

00:05:09.030 --> 00:05:09.830 align:middle line:90%
so don't worry.

00:05:09.830 --> 00:05:11.720 align:middle line:84%
And don't worry
which timeline you're

00:05:11.720 --> 00:05:15.800 align:middle line:84%
on because essentially, you
will experience all of them.

00:05:15.800 --> 00:05:18.830 align:middle line:84%
That's basically how the
nature of reality works.

00:05:18.830 --> 00:05:21.770 align:middle line:84%
In a sense, we are
all one really,

00:05:21.770 --> 00:05:23.480 align:middle line:90%
so you can't do anything wrong.

00:05:23.480 --> 00:05:25.790 align:middle line:90%
But the negative timeline ends.

00:05:25.790 --> 00:05:29.300 align:middle line:84%
And the people or the souls
that still have more negativity

00:05:29.300 --> 00:05:32.870 align:middle line:84%
to work on will be
transferred somewhere else

00:05:32.870 --> 00:05:35.090 align:middle line:90%
where there's more dualistic.

00:05:35.090 --> 00:05:37.430 align:middle line:90%
It's a more dualistic realm.

00:05:37.430 --> 00:05:41.120 align:middle line:84%
But many lightworkers will
be strategically placed

00:05:41.120 --> 00:05:42.830 align:middle line:90%
in the middle timeline.

00:05:42.830 --> 00:05:45.470 align:middle line:84%
And their job will
be to try to shift

00:05:45.470 --> 00:05:48.380 align:middle line:84%
the perspective of
everyone to bump them up

00:05:48.380 --> 00:05:51.560 align:middle line:84%
to the highest timeline,
which all this really

00:05:51.560 --> 00:05:53.690 align:middle line:90%
is, is an internal shift.

00:05:53.690 --> 00:05:58.340 align:middle line:84%
So by understanding certain
principles, releasing fears,

00:05:58.340 --> 00:06:01.880 align:middle line:84%
you all of a sudden go up to
the highest timeline anyway.

00:06:01.880 --> 00:06:05.910 align:middle line:84%
So the lightworker's job will
be to help shift perspectives,

00:06:05.910 --> 00:06:06.710 align:middle line:90%
basically.

00:06:06.710 --> 00:06:10.810 align:middle line:84%
That is what I've been
told is what's to come.

00:06:10.810 --> 00:06:13.500 align:middle line:10%
But I want to tell
you this, which

00:06:13.500 --> 00:06:15.840 align:middle line:10%
is so super interesting to me.

00:06:15.840 --> 00:06:18.630 align:middle line:10%
The extraterrestrials or
the higher consciousness

00:06:18.630 --> 00:06:21.100 align:middle line:10%
has said that you know when
you look up in the sky,

00:06:21.100 --> 00:06:21.960 align:middle line:10%
you see stars?

00:06:21.960 --> 00:06:23.340 align:middle line:90%
Those are not stars.

00:06:23.340 --> 00:06:25.050 align:middle line:90%
They're actually portals.

00:06:25.050 --> 00:06:28.560 align:middle line:84%
And that humanity comes
from different portals,

00:06:28.560 --> 00:06:31.830 align:middle line:84%
different originating
star clusters.

00:06:31.830 --> 00:06:33.630 align:middle line:84%
You can find out
which one you come

00:06:33.630 --> 00:06:35.640 align:middle line:84%
from by just
looking into the sky

00:06:35.640 --> 00:06:38.010 align:middle line:84%
and seeing which one
you resonate with.

00:06:38.010 --> 00:06:42.450 align:middle line:84%
Like you might always be drawn
to a certain star cluster.

00:06:42.450 --> 00:06:47.850 align:middle line:84%
That'll be a good indicator that
that's your originating portal.

00:06:47.850 --> 00:06:51.240 align:middle line:84%
The nature of reality and the
way this is working right now

00:06:51.240 --> 00:06:55.620 align:middle line:84%
is that all of humanity comes
from about 13 different star

00:06:55.620 --> 00:06:56.640 align:middle line:90%
systems.

00:06:56.640 --> 00:06:59.400 align:middle line:84%
And these portals,
these originating stars

00:06:59.400 --> 00:07:01.260 align:middle line:90%
are actually moving.

00:07:01.260 --> 00:07:06.130 align:middle line:84%
It's like it moves in
a snakelike pattern.

00:07:06.130 --> 00:07:09.480 align:middle line:84%
And when they're angled
up, it means that humanity

00:07:09.480 --> 00:07:12.040 align:middle line:90%
is going into a golden age.

00:07:12.040 --> 00:07:13.920 align:middle line:84%
And if it's angled
down, it means they're

00:07:13.920 --> 00:07:15.780 align:middle line:90%
going into a more negative age.

00:07:15.780 --> 00:07:20.610 align:middle line:84%
Well, all of the originating
star clusters are moving up.

00:07:20.610 --> 00:07:23.850 align:middle line:84%
So it is an alignment
with our stars

00:07:23.850 --> 00:07:26.280 align:middle line:84%
that we're actually
moving into a golden age.

00:07:26.280 --> 00:07:30.630 align:middle line:84%
So there's nothing anybody can
do about this to take this away.

00:07:30.630 --> 00:07:32.490 align:middle line:90%
There's nothing.

00:07:32.490 --> 00:07:35.290 align:middle line:90%
Evolution is happening.

00:07:35.290 --> 00:07:38.190 align:middle line:84%
The big Great
Awakening is happening.

00:07:38.190 --> 00:07:41.670 align:middle line:90%
But what made us less powerful?

00:07:41.670 --> 00:07:44.460 align:middle line:84%
How did all of
this stuff happen?

00:07:44.460 --> 00:07:47.280 align:middle line:90%


00:07:47.280 --> 00:07:50.490 align:middle line:84%
These beings know
how powerful we are.

00:07:50.490 --> 00:07:53.550 align:middle line:84%
And they knew that if
they could suppress power,

00:07:53.550 --> 00:07:55.980 align:middle line:84%
that they could
suppress our knowledge,

00:07:55.980 --> 00:07:59.520 align:middle line:84%
that they could
hinder this growth

00:07:59.520 --> 00:08:03.780 align:middle line:84%
and prolong it
for their benefit.

00:08:03.780 --> 00:08:07.020 align:middle line:84%
There has been a lot of
suppression of the most powerful

00:08:07.020 --> 00:08:09.520 align:middle line:90%
things like women.

00:08:09.520 --> 00:08:12.540 align:middle line:84%
Especially if you look back
to the witches or even back

00:08:12.540 --> 00:08:16.200 align:middle line:84%
to the ancient cultures,
women were the natural leaders

00:08:16.200 --> 00:08:17.760 align:middle line:84%
because, like I
said, they carried

00:08:17.760 --> 00:08:21.030 align:middle line:84%
through their subconscious
really important information,

00:08:21.030 --> 00:08:22.800 align:middle line:90%
Indigenous cultures.

00:08:22.800 --> 00:08:25.110 align:middle line:84%
If you look around
the world, everything

00:08:25.110 --> 00:08:27.990 align:middle line:84%
that has been
suppressed, that's where

00:08:27.990 --> 00:08:32.929 align:middle line:84%
you're going to find the
information, the power.

00:08:32.929 --> 00:08:36.220 align:middle line:84%
So I wanted to know
why all this happened.

00:08:36.220 --> 00:08:40.659 align:middle line:84%
Why has this been
taken away from us?

00:08:40.659 --> 00:08:42.742 align:middle line:90%
Why are we targeted?

00:08:42.742 --> 00:08:43.726 align:middle line:90%
[AUDIO PLAYBACK]

00:08:43.726 --> 00:08:48.990 align:middle line:10%
- Why were humans
so targeted to not

00:08:48.990 --> 00:08:52.880 align:middle line:10%
have access to their potential?

00:08:52.880 --> 00:08:56.440 align:middle line:10%
- This is a matter
of perspective.

00:08:56.440 --> 00:09:00.370 align:middle line:10%
The seed does not
flourish that is not

00:09:00.370 --> 00:09:06.790 align:middle line:10%
challenged, for it has no
reason to find its strength.

00:09:06.790 --> 00:09:14.410 align:middle line:10%
It has no reason to adapt and
find new resources within.

00:09:14.410 --> 00:09:19.960 align:middle line:10%
If one is left unchallenged
in a perfect condition,

00:09:19.960 --> 00:09:23.690 align:middle line:10%
one will stay static.

00:09:23.690 --> 00:09:31.970 align:middle line:10%
And so to say that humans are
burdened with influences that

00:09:31.970 --> 00:09:36.170 align:middle line:10%
attack them, that
push them down,

00:09:36.170 --> 00:09:41.450 align:middle line:10%
this is but one
perspective and one

00:09:41.450 --> 00:09:45.990 align:middle line:10%
that is a rather
limited perspective.

00:09:45.990 --> 00:09:51.540 align:middle line:10%
Another perspective that is
more broad and encompassing

00:09:51.540 --> 00:09:58.140 align:middle line:10%
sees that this is merely
allowing the youngling

00:09:58.140 --> 00:10:02.790 align:middle line:10%
to find its depths
within itself.

00:10:02.790 --> 00:10:11.890 align:middle line:10%
And in finding those depths,
it will find the potential

00:10:11.890 --> 00:10:14.590 align:middle line:10%
that is ultimately unlimited.

00:10:14.590 --> 00:10:15.390 align:middle line:90%
[END PLAYBACK]

00:10:15.390 --> 00:10:17.660 align:middle line:90%
>> So they said we decided.

00:10:17.660 --> 00:10:19.130 align:middle line:90%
We chose this.

00:10:19.130 --> 00:10:25.470 align:middle line:84%
We wanted this to really see
how powerful we really were.

00:10:25.470 --> 00:10:29.210 align:middle line:84%
We wanted to stoop to
the depths of being--

00:10:29.210 --> 00:10:35.190 align:middle line:84%
of feeling powerless to come
to understand ourselves better.

00:10:35.190 --> 00:10:38.730 align:middle line:84%
So the real nature
of our reality,

00:10:38.730 --> 00:10:41.120 align:middle line:84%
I've been told through
so many higher selves,

00:10:41.120 --> 00:10:45.140 align:middle line:84%
is if you didn't see
with your physical eyes,

00:10:45.140 --> 00:10:48.080 align:middle line:90%
it really looks like blackness.

00:10:48.080 --> 00:10:49.460 align:middle line:90%
There's nothing.

00:10:49.460 --> 00:10:51.350 align:middle line:90%
There's nothing there.

00:10:51.350 --> 00:10:55.670 align:middle line:84%
It's like so--
not even physical.

00:10:55.670 --> 00:10:59.120 align:middle line:84%
This is all being rendered,
all being created.

00:10:59.120 --> 00:11:02.480 align:middle line:84%
These universes,
this planet has all

00:11:02.480 --> 00:11:05.960 align:middle line:84%
been created for this
experience, for this game.

00:11:05.960 --> 00:11:09.980 align:middle line:84%
And other beings
watch us constantly.

00:11:09.980 --> 00:11:12.860 align:middle line:84%
They have councils
about what we did,

00:11:12.860 --> 00:11:14.810 align:middle line:90%
probably even like one person.

00:11:14.810 --> 00:11:16.845 align:middle line:84%
They're like, oh my
God, there she goes.

00:11:16.845 --> 00:11:20.010 align:middle line:90%


00:11:20.010 --> 00:11:24.360 align:middle line:10%
And there's a spiritual
purpose of trauma.

00:11:24.360 --> 00:11:28.813 align:middle line:84%
So trauma is actually the
doorway to enlightenment.

00:11:28.813 --> 00:11:30.230 align:middle line:84%
I don't know if
you guys have ever

00:11:30.230 --> 00:11:34.070 align:middle line:84%
heard that saying, suffering's
the doorway to enlightenment.

00:11:34.070 --> 00:11:36.980 align:middle line:84%
Pretty much that seems
to be how we grow.

00:11:36.980 --> 00:11:40.610 align:middle line:84%
We choose different lessons
for our soul's growth.

00:11:40.610 --> 00:11:43.850 align:middle line:84%
And it usually starts with
some sort of a trauma.

00:11:43.850 --> 00:11:48.020 align:middle line:84%
Just like I was asking
the higher self recently

00:11:48.020 --> 00:11:50.090 align:middle line:84%
because so many of my
clients wanted to know

00:11:50.090 --> 00:11:54.350 align:middle line:84%
and I wanted to know too for the
future, hopefully a long time

00:11:54.350 --> 00:11:57.140 align:middle line:90%
from now, about menopause.

00:11:57.140 --> 00:12:00.245 align:middle line:84%
And I was like, why the hell do
women have to go through this?

00:12:00.245 --> 00:12:01.760 align:middle line:90%
This is horrible.

00:12:01.760 --> 00:12:04.170 align:middle line:84%
And they were like,
oh, no, it's a gift.

00:12:04.170 --> 00:12:05.870 align:middle line:90%
I was like, shut up.

00:12:05.870 --> 00:12:07.160 align:middle line:90%
I don't think so.

00:12:07.160 --> 00:12:09.500 align:middle line:84%
Everybody's pretty
pissed about it.

00:12:09.500 --> 00:12:11.870 align:middle line:84%
And they were like,
yeah, it's a gift

00:12:11.870 --> 00:12:17.000 align:middle line:84%
because it allows a woman to
actually be triggered and have

00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:18.750 align:middle line:90%
all these symptoms.

00:12:18.750 --> 00:12:22.700 align:middle line:84%
So they have to find
out who they truly are.

00:12:22.700 --> 00:12:23.801 align:middle line:90%
What the--

00:12:23.801 --> 00:12:26.160 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:12:26.160 --> 00:12:28.260 align:middle line:84%
But they were like,
you're so lucky you're

00:12:28.260 --> 00:12:30.240 align:middle line:84%
going to get to go
through it someday.

00:12:30.240 --> 00:12:33.180 align:middle line:90%
And I'm like, OK.

00:12:33.180 --> 00:12:36.300 align:middle line:90%
But that's what we do.

00:12:36.300 --> 00:12:38.040 align:middle line:90%
We choose these things.

00:12:38.040 --> 00:12:41.070 align:middle line:84%
And it's so interesting when
I'm taking all my clients

00:12:41.070 --> 00:12:43.860 align:middle line:90%
in-between after a lifetime.

00:12:43.860 --> 00:12:46.440 align:middle line:84%
They'll see that
they're really God.

00:12:46.440 --> 00:12:48.120 align:middle line:84%
They'll see that
they're God again.

00:12:48.120 --> 00:12:50.130 align:middle line:84%
And then they'll
also see that they

00:12:50.130 --> 00:12:53.250 align:middle line:84%
want that separation
and that forgetfulness.

00:12:53.250 --> 00:12:57.330 align:middle line:84%
And they want to come into a
life with all these challenges

00:12:57.330 --> 00:13:02.430 align:middle line:84%
because they want the experience
of being so different from who

00:13:02.430 --> 00:13:03.690 align:middle line:90%
they really are.

00:13:03.690 --> 00:13:06.390 align:middle line:84%
They want to have all
that forgetfulness

00:13:06.390 --> 00:13:10.650 align:middle line:84%
because the amount of growth
your soul experiences when it

00:13:10.650 --> 00:13:14.580 align:middle line:84%
forgets everything, and
then regains it and learns

00:13:14.580 --> 00:13:16.170 align:middle line:90%
is tremendous.

00:13:16.170 --> 00:13:18.940 align:middle line:84%
And they're actually
jealous of one another.

00:13:18.940 --> 00:13:22.680 align:middle line:84%
They're like, Joe just came
back from that lifetime

00:13:22.680 --> 00:13:24.330 align:middle line:90%
where he didn't have a foot.

00:13:24.330 --> 00:13:26.930 align:middle line:90%
And he got a lot from that.

00:13:26.930 --> 00:13:28.720 align:middle line:90%
I want that experience.

00:13:28.720 --> 00:13:31.480 align:middle line:84%
And the guy's like,
no, you don't?

00:13:31.480 --> 00:13:33.160 align:middle line:90%
That's really hard.

00:13:33.160 --> 00:13:35.770 align:middle line:84%
You're like, yes, I do
because look at Joe.

00:13:35.770 --> 00:13:37.510 align:middle line:90%
He's so happy right now.

00:13:37.510 --> 00:13:39.160 align:middle line:90%
He looks great.

00:13:39.160 --> 00:13:41.290 align:middle line:84%
They describe them
as looking great,

00:13:41.290 --> 00:13:43.420 align:middle line:90%
like their soul is so shiny.

00:13:43.420 --> 00:13:47.650 align:middle line:90%
And your team is like, no, no.

00:13:47.650 --> 00:13:51.500 align:middle line:84%
We're not going to let
you do that one this time.

00:13:51.500 --> 00:13:53.150 align:middle line:10%
So why are we here?

00:13:53.150 --> 00:13:55.960 align:middle line:10%
We're here to
forget and remember.

00:13:55.960 --> 00:13:57.730 align:middle line:90%
We're here to remember.

00:13:57.730 --> 00:14:00.730 align:middle line:84%
And guess who hid
all of the clues?

00:14:00.730 --> 00:14:03.220 align:middle line:90%
You did.

00:14:03.220 --> 00:14:07.930 align:middle line:84%
Because you're like, oh, why
am I all of a sudden meeting

00:14:07.930 --> 00:14:10.150 align:middle line:90%
so-and-so?

00:14:10.150 --> 00:14:12.340 align:middle line:84%
I feel like it was
set up that I was

00:14:12.340 --> 00:14:14.320 align:middle line:90%
supposed to meet that person.

00:14:14.320 --> 00:14:18.660 align:middle line:84%
And it was you that
hid it for yourself.

00:14:18.660 --> 00:14:20.960 align:middle line:10%
The power of belief is huge.

00:14:20.960 --> 00:14:23.160 align:middle line:10%
The power of belief
is everything.

00:14:23.160 --> 00:14:26.420 align:middle line:84%
So if you just think about your
life and what kind of things

00:14:26.420 --> 00:14:28.160 align:middle line:90%
are you believing.

00:14:28.160 --> 00:14:31.790 align:middle line:84%
And you can even go
back through your life

00:14:31.790 --> 00:14:35.570 align:middle line:90%
and just dissect and examine.

00:14:35.570 --> 00:14:39.800 align:middle line:84%
I believe this about myself,
or I believe this about reality

00:14:39.800 --> 00:14:43.680 align:middle line:84%
because none of this
stuff is actually true.

00:14:43.680 --> 00:14:46.310 align:middle line:84%
The higher self and all
these extraterrestrials

00:14:46.310 --> 00:14:48.950 align:middle line:84%
say that we learn
through storytelling.

00:14:48.950 --> 00:14:51.890 align:middle line:84%
And we create all these
stories about ourselves

00:14:51.890 --> 00:14:55.490 align:middle line:84%
that are not even true, that
we have unlimited power.

00:14:55.490 --> 00:14:58.660 align:middle line:90%
We have unlimited potential.

00:14:58.660 --> 00:15:01.890 align:middle line:84%
So I wanted to talk
directly to the higher self,

00:15:01.890 --> 00:15:05.422 align:middle line:84%
find out how they
feel about everything.

00:15:05.422 --> 00:15:06.222 align:middle line:90%
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:15:06.222 --> 00:15:10.940 align:middle line:10%
- Jasmine loves
being an earthling.

00:15:10.940 --> 00:15:13.430 align:middle line:10%
That's her favorite.

00:15:13.430 --> 00:15:18.350 align:middle line:10%
But I much enjoy being
in a higher plane

00:15:18.350 --> 00:15:21.560 align:middle line:10%
and not dealing with the
mundaneness of day-to-day life.

00:15:21.560 --> 00:15:24.570 align:middle line:10%
- What do you enjoy the most?

00:15:24.570 --> 00:15:30.666 align:middle line:10%
- I enjoy being with
other high beings.

00:15:30.666 --> 00:15:32.692 align:middle line:10%
- What do you do?

00:15:32.692 --> 00:15:34.980 align:middle line:10%
- We communicate mostly.

00:15:34.980 --> 00:15:36.480 align:middle line:10%
And we watch you.

00:15:36.480 --> 00:15:37.650 align:middle line:10%
- Oh, you watch us?

00:15:37.650 --> 00:15:39.120 align:middle line:10%
- Mm-hmm.

00:15:39.120 --> 00:15:44.820 align:middle line:10%
Not you specifically
but generally humans.

00:15:44.820 --> 00:15:47.940 align:middle line:84%
- Are there particular
humans you watch?

00:15:47.940 --> 00:15:51.330 align:middle line:84%
- Well, I keep pretty
good tabs on Jasmine.

00:15:51.330 --> 00:15:52.545 align:middle line:90%
- How's she doing?

00:15:52.545 --> 00:15:55.260 align:middle line:90%
- She's doing well.

00:15:55.260 --> 00:15:56.880 align:middle line:90%
She seems happy.

00:15:56.880 --> 00:15:58.760 align:middle line:10%
- Good.

00:15:58.760 --> 00:16:04.940 align:middle line:10%
So what did you and these other
higher beings talk about today?

00:16:04.940 --> 00:16:07.820 align:middle line:10%
You said you like to talk
with other higher beings.

00:16:07.820 --> 00:16:11.060 align:middle line:10%
- We talk about the
trajectory of this planet.

00:16:11.060 --> 00:16:13.496 align:middle line:10%
- Tell me more about that.

00:16:13.496 --> 00:16:21.506 align:middle line:10%
- Well, sometimes we're
concerned for human beings.

00:16:21.506 --> 00:16:22.340 align:middle line:10%
- Why.

00:16:22.340 --> 00:16:28.760 align:middle line:10%
- Mostly because you haven't
quite all figured out yet

00:16:28.760 --> 00:16:29.975 align:middle line:10%
what you're here to do.

00:16:29.975 --> 00:16:32.075 align:middle line:10%
- What are we here to do?

00:16:32.075 --> 00:16:36.170 align:middle line:10%
- Well, you're here to know
yourself authentically,

00:16:36.170 --> 00:16:39.250 align:middle line:10%
each person individually.

00:16:39.250 --> 00:16:43.110 align:middle line:10%
- So everyone's supposed to
know themselves authentically?

00:16:43.110 --> 00:16:44.430 align:middle line:90%
- That is your work.

00:16:44.430 --> 00:16:46.120 align:middle line:90%
- That is?

00:16:46.120 --> 00:16:48.055 align:middle line:90%
Can you tell me more about that?

00:16:48.055 --> 00:16:50.390 align:middle line:90%
- Of course.

00:16:50.390 --> 00:16:52.550 align:middle line:10%
Knowing yourself
authentically is

00:16:52.550 --> 00:16:57.300 align:middle line:10%
what empowers others to know
themselves authentically.

00:16:57.300 --> 00:16:58.620 align:middle line:10%
- How?

00:16:58.620 --> 00:17:00.915 align:middle line:10%
- By seeing what you're doing.

00:17:00.915 --> 00:17:01.980 align:middle line:10%
- Oh, OK.

00:17:01.980 --> 00:17:06.450 align:middle line:10%
- By seeing your
freedom within yourself.

00:17:06.450 --> 00:17:12.200 align:middle line:10%
Meanwhile, most humans
are so caught up

00:17:12.200 --> 00:17:16.940 align:middle line:10%
in being exactly the
same as one another

00:17:16.940 --> 00:17:20.390 align:middle line:10%
and doing the same
thing, that no barriers

00:17:20.390 --> 00:17:22.970 align:middle line:10%
are being broken down.

00:17:22.970 --> 00:17:26.480 align:middle line:10%
And no progress is being made.

00:17:26.480 --> 00:17:28.580 align:middle line:10%
Well, some progress
is being made.

00:17:28.580 --> 00:17:33.200 align:middle line:10%
But it seems that
lately that people

00:17:33.200 --> 00:17:35.240 align:middle line:10%
are even more homogenized.

00:17:35.240 --> 00:17:38.405 align:middle line:10%
- Oh, tell me more about that.

00:17:38.405 --> 00:17:43.320 align:middle line:10%
- They're wanting
even more to be small

00:17:43.320 --> 00:17:46.160 align:middle line:10%
and to be in a herd
or a pack of others.

fact that we want to be like

00:17:49.590 --> 00:17:50.610 align:middle line:90%
everyone else.

00:17:50.610 --> 00:17:53.490 align:middle line:84%
And they have conferences
about that, not conferences,

00:17:53.490 --> 00:17:54.570 align:middle line:90%
but they get together.

00:17:54.570 --> 00:17:56.280 align:middle line:90%
And they talk about this.

00:17:56.280 --> 00:17:58.350 align:middle line:90%
That's what they worry about.

00:17:58.350 --> 00:18:00.100 align:middle line:84%
That's what they're
worried about.

00:18:00.100 --> 00:18:02.790 align:middle line:84%
They're like, we don't
understand why you guys haven't

00:18:02.790 --> 00:18:04.110 align:middle line:90%
figured it out yet.

00:18:04.110 --> 00:18:06.720 align:middle line:84%
You're supposed to be
your individual self,

00:18:06.720 --> 00:18:08.400 align:middle line:90%
not like everyone else.

00:18:08.400 --> 00:18:10.600 align:middle line:84%
And that's what
we're here to do.

00:18:10.600 --> 00:18:14.020 align:middle line:84%
We're here to learn
who we really are.

00:18:14.020 --> 00:18:19.980 align:middle line:84%
So right now on the planet now,
there are so many light codes

00:18:19.980 --> 00:18:21.073 align:middle line:90%
hitting the planet.

00:18:21.073 --> 00:18:23.115 align:middle line:10%
I'm going to let you listen
to this really quick.

00:18:27.660 --> 00:18:30.285 align:middle line:10%
they're being activated.

00:18:30.285 --> 00:18:35.790 align:middle line:10%
They're within your body
like codes within your DNA.

00:18:35.790 --> 00:18:38.190 align:middle line:10%
These are being activated.

00:18:38.190 --> 00:18:42.410 align:middle line:10%
And the same thing is
happening with the Earth

00:18:42.410 --> 00:18:49.030 align:middle line:10%
per DNA, some light
codes within her DNA.

00:18:49.030 --> 00:18:51.080 align:middle line:10%
These are being activated.

00:18:51.080 --> 00:18:55.190 align:middle line:90%


00:18:55.190 --> 00:18:57.740 align:middle line:10%
That's what's important.

00:18:57.740 --> 00:19:05.288 align:middle line:10%
These light codes are now
being triggered and activated.

00:19:05.288 --> 00:19:07.310 align:middle line:10%
- What can a human
do while they're

00:19:07.310 --> 00:19:10.012 align:middle line:10%
being triggered and activated?

00:19:10.012 --> 00:19:14.670 align:middle line:84%
- To remain grounded,
very grounded.

Allow the Earth to support you.

as they wish to go
through it with her.

00:19:31.160 --> 00:19:32.590 align:middle line:90%
They are supported.

00:19:32.590 --> 00:19:33.535 align:middle line:10%
They are safe.

[END PLAYBACK]

00:19:43.900 --> 00:19:47.080 align:middle line:84%
>> Everyone keeps saying
we're in for a beautiful ride.

00:19:47.080 --> 00:19:49.750 align:middle line:84%
But one of the things
we can do, they've said,

00:19:49.750 --> 00:19:53.290 align:middle line:84%
is to go outside a
little bit every day

00:19:53.290 --> 00:19:57.460 align:middle line:84%
without sunglasses or without
anything over our eyes

00:19:57.460 --> 00:20:00.250 align:middle line:84%
because we need to get-- right
now with all these light codes

00:20:00.250 --> 00:20:03.040 align:middle line:84%
being broadcast through
the portal of the sun,

00:20:03.040 --> 00:20:06.850 align:middle line:84%
we need to get some of this
information, some of this light.

00:20:06.850 --> 00:20:09.760 align:middle line:84%
So they said that what's
happening right now

00:20:09.760 --> 00:20:12.100 align:middle line:84%
is through the
portal of the sun,

00:20:12.100 --> 00:20:14.410 align:middle line:84%
there's all kinds
of information,

00:20:14.410 --> 00:20:18.760 align:middle line:84%
all kinds of stuff coming
through that's activating us.

00:20:18.760 --> 00:20:21.850 align:middle line:84%
And all you have to do is
go outside with a little--

00:20:21.850 --> 00:20:23.920 align:middle line:84%
get a little
unfiltered sunlight.

00:20:23.920 --> 00:20:26.410 align:middle line:84%
And it goes straight
through your unfiltered eyes

00:20:26.410 --> 00:20:28.000 align:middle line:90%
into your pineal gland.

00:20:28.000 --> 00:20:30.310 align:middle line:84%
And it's actually
activating your body

00:20:30.310 --> 00:20:33.510 align:middle line:90%
and giving you information.

00:20:33.510 --> 00:20:36.270 align:middle line:84%
But the power of
emotions I found out

00:20:36.270 --> 00:20:38.880 align:middle line:84%
through so many different
extraterrestrials

00:20:38.880 --> 00:20:41.190 align:middle line:90%
allows us to actually manifest.

00:20:41.190 --> 00:20:43.770 align:middle line:84%
So extraterrestrials
said that we're

00:20:43.770 --> 00:20:46.530 align:middle line:84%
unique in our emotional
body because you

00:20:46.530 --> 00:20:51.060 align:middle line:84%
can use your emotions to
manifest or manipulate reality.

00:20:51.060 --> 00:20:53.790 align:middle line:84%
They said basically
what we can do

00:20:53.790 --> 00:20:57.300 align:middle line:84%
is that we can actually
experience a really

00:20:57.300 --> 00:21:00.090 align:middle line:90%
strong emotion because humans--

00:21:00.090 --> 00:21:02.640 align:middle line:84%
and humans aren't really
aware of this, they've said,

00:21:02.640 --> 00:21:06.990 align:middle line:84%
is any time a human
experiences a strong emotion,

00:21:06.990 --> 00:21:10.660 align:middle line:84%
it's already opening
up a portal, any time.

00:21:10.660 --> 00:21:14.130 align:middle line:84%
So if you're really happy,
it's opening up a portal.

00:21:14.130 --> 00:21:17.550 align:middle line:84%
If you're really pissed off,
it's opening up a portal.

00:21:17.550 --> 00:21:19.620 align:middle line:90%
So if you're really--

00:21:19.620 --> 00:21:23.190 align:middle line:84%
if you really want to use
this and manipulate the matter

00:21:23.190 --> 00:21:25.620 align:middle line:84%
around you, what
they've said you can do

00:21:25.620 --> 00:21:29.610 align:middle line:84%
is to bring yourself into a
very high state, a very positive

00:21:29.610 --> 00:21:30.750 align:middle line:90%
emotion.

00:21:30.750 --> 00:21:33.070 align:middle line:90%
And that will open up a portal.

00:21:33.070 --> 00:21:36.580 align:middle line:84%
And emotions can act as the
gateway through the universe.

00:21:36.580 --> 00:21:41.260 align:middle line:84%
We actually have within
us this amazing technology

00:21:41.260 --> 00:21:43.380 align:middle line:90%
that actually we can use.

00:21:43.380 --> 00:21:45.250 align:middle line:90%
We just have never learned how.

00:21:45.250 --> 00:21:48.520 align:middle line:84%
So what you do is you focus
on a positive emotion,

00:21:48.520 --> 00:21:51.850 align:middle line:84%
and then visualize
this portal opening,

00:21:51.850 --> 00:21:57.100 align:middle line:84%
and then imagine or use your
visualizations to pull forward

00:21:57.100 --> 00:22:00.820 align:middle line:84%
to you something that
you wish to bring forward

00:22:00.820 --> 00:22:03.640 align:middle line:84%
through these portals
of possibilities.

00:22:03.640 --> 00:22:07.250 align:middle line:84%
And you want to use your
visualizations to do that.

00:22:07.250 --> 00:22:11.760 align:middle line:10%
And they said you can
do anything with this.

00:22:11.760 --> 00:22:14.550 align:middle line:10%
You can use sound
to heal your body.

00:22:14.550 --> 00:22:17.160 align:middle line:10%
That sound is so powerful
that you can actually

00:22:17.160 --> 00:22:20.910 align:middle line:10%
change your reality just
by creating mantras.

00:22:20.910 --> 00:22:25.050 align:middle line:84%
They said in the ancient
societies, they understood this.

00:22:25.050 --> 00:22:28.360 align:middle line:84%
You could use sound
and frequencies.

00:22:28.360 --> 00:22:30.070 align:middle line:10%
You can use nature.

00:22:30.070 --> 00:22:31.840 align:middle line:10%
They said that one
thing you can do

00:22:31.840 --> 00:22:34.360 align:middle line:10%
is to start developing
a relationship

00:22:34.360 --> 00:22:36.700 align:middle line:10%
with your natural surroundings.

00:22:36.700 --> 00:22:41.900 align:middle line:84%
And when you do that, it
actually responds to you.

00:22:41.900 --> 00:22:44.950 align:middle line:84%
And if you start to
develop a relationship

00:22:44.950 --> 00:22:48.310 align:middle line:84%
with your natural surroundings,
you'll all of a sudden

00:22:48.310 --> 00:22:52.270 align:middle line:84%
start getting messages
from the nature around you.

00:22:52.270 --> 00:22:55.060 align:middle line:84%
And certain things will
start growing around you

00:22:55.060 --> 00:22:58.510 align:middle line:90%
that could be cures for you.

00:22:58.510 --> 00:23:02.520 align:middle line:84%
So right now, the fourth
and even the fifth dimension

00:23:02.520 --> 00:23:04.030 align:middle line:90%
is already here.

00:23:04.030 --> 00:23:06.370 align:middle line:84%
But we don't know
how to access it.

00:23:06.370 --> 00:23:08.460 align:middle line:84%
And the extraterrestrials
have told us

00:23:08.460 --> 00:23:11.550 align:middle line:84%
this is so brand new
to humanity that we

00:23:11.550 --> 00:23:13.980 align:middle line:90%
have to start slowly learning.

00:23:13.980 --> 00:23:16.800 align:middle line:84%
And when one person
starts to open their mind

00:23:16.800 --> 00:23:20.100 align:middle line:84%
to these new subtle energies,
then the rest of humanity

00:23:20.100 --> 00:23:21.690 align:middle line:90%
will start learning as well.

00:23:21.690 --> 00:23:24.720 align:middle line:84%
It's almost like the
hundredth monkey effect.

00:23:24.720 --> 00:23:27.240 align:middle line:84%
But right now what
we're supposed to do

00:23:27.240 --> 00:23:32.490 align:middle line:84%
is to develop our subtle
energies or our subtle--

00:23:32.490 --> 00:23:36.840 align:middle line:84%
we're actually supposed
to read the environment.

00:23:36.840 --> 00:23:39.660 align:middle line:90%
Empaths are already doing this.

00:23:39.660 --> 00:23:42.450 align:middle line:84%
And this is actually
a huge ability.

00:23:42.450 --> 00:23:45.010 align:middle line:84%
But we're being bombarded
with different things.

00:23:45.010 --> 00:23:47.460 align:middle line:84%
And we have to
slowly start to learn

00:23:47.460 --> 00:23:50.430 align:middle line:90%
how to read this information.

00:23:50.430 --> 00:23:54.990 align:middle line:84%
And it's going to be a process
because it's so brand new.

00:23:54.990 --> 00:23:55.860 align:middle line:90%
[AUDIO PLAYBACK]

00:23:55.860 --> 00:24:00.900 align:middle line:84%
- So if we want to access
more of this intelligence,

00:24:00.900 --> 00:24:06.400 align:middle line:84%
of this new energy,
then we can't hold on

00:24:06.400 --> 00:24:11.500 align:middle line:84%
to our past and our
beliefs and our ideas

00:24:11.500 --> 00:24:15.685 align:middle line:84%
because it cuts us off
from what is actually here.

00:24:15.685 --> 00:24:18.340 align:middle line:90%


00:24:18.340 --> 00:24:23.090 align:middle line:84%
Because what is here is
essentially brand new.

00:24:23.090 --> 00:24:29.450 align:middle line:84%
And we are not making ourselves
available or attuned to it

00:24:29.450 --> 00:24:31.325 align:middle line:84%
because we're still
stuck in the past.

00:24:31.325 --> 00:24:34.690 align:middle line:90%


00:24:34.690 --> 00:24:40.742 align:middle line:84%
through our mental attachment
to our mind, to our thoughts.

[END PLAYBACK]

00:24:41.542 --> 00:24:45.860 align:middle line:84%
>> So they were saying if you go
outside and you live in a place

00:24:45.860 --> 00:24:49.730 align:middle line:84%
that has trees or you have
a garden and you develop

00:24:49.730 --> 00:24:52.460 align:middle line:84%
your relationship with
that natural surrounding,

00:24:52.460 --> 00:24:55.970 align:middle line:84%
you might notice that all of a
sudden these strange weeds start

00:24:55.970 --> 00:24:56.990 align:middle line:90%
popping up.

00:24:56.990 --> 00:24:59.900 align:middle line:84%
We'll see if you can find
out what these weeds really

00:24:59.900 --> 00:25:02.750 align:middle line:84%
are because the
extraterrestrials have said

00:25:02.750 --> 00:25:07.460 align:middle line:84%
that they will actually be cures
for some kind of issue you have.

00:25:07.460 --> 00:25:10.130 align:middle line:84%
So I asked them
for myself, well,

00:25:10.130 --> 00:25:11.540 align:middle line:90%
I live in the Florida Keys.

00:25:11.540 --> 00:25:14.990 align:middle line:84%
And there's a mango tree
that's growing outside.

00:25:14.990 --> 00:25:17.690 align:middle line:84%
And they said, yeah,
look up mango leaves.

00:25:17.690 --> 00:25:21.300 align:middle line:84%
This makes an amazing
tea for different things.

00:25:21.300 --> 00:25:25.730 align:middle line:84%
So they said that this will be
relevant to me and my family

00:25:25.730 --> 00:25:30.060 align:middle line:84%
because we've developed this
relationship with our area.

00:25:30.060 --> 00:25:32.150 align:middle line:84%
So if you have a weed
that all of a sudden

00:25:32.150 --> 00:25:37.050 align:middle line:84%
pops up into your garden, before
you're quick to get rid of it,

00:25:37.050 --> 00:25:39.860 align:middle line:90%
look up what properties it has.

00:25:39.860 --> 00:25:43.430 align:middle line:84%
So crystals,
extraterrestrials have said,

00:25:43.430 --> 00:25:45.830 align:middle line:84%
are really interesting
because I never really knew

00:25:45.830 --> 00:25:47.450 align:middle line:90%
how to work with them.

00:25:47.450 --> 00:25:53.780 align:middle line:84%
And they said that the harmonics
of a crystal are perfect.

00:25:53.780 --> 00:25:58.490 align:middle line:84%
So they create a specific
harmony, like a frequency.

00:25:58.490 --> 00:26:02.090 align:middle line:84%
Even when you pick up a
rock and you're on a walk,

00:26:02.090 --> 00:26:05.570 align:middle line:84%
it will actually start
to work with your body.

00:26:05.570 --> 00:26:09.930 align:middle line:84%
It will start to change
the frequency of your body.

00:26:09.930 --> 00:26:13.250 align:middle line:84%
So knowing this and
understanding that it's actually

00:26:13.250 --> 00:26:17.150 align:middle line:84%
interacting with your field,
you can use the crystal

00:26:17.150 --> 00:26:21.110 align:middle line:84%
to reprogram your
energetic field because it

00:26:21.110 --> 00:26:24.740 align:middle line:84%
will bring your field into
a natural state of harmony

00:26:24.740 --> 00:26:26.090 align:middle line:90%
if you ask it.

00:26:26.090 --> 00:26:29.240 align:middle line:84%
And these crystals
are known to do this.

00:26:29.240 --> 00:26:33.110 align:middle line:84%
You can actually use your
crystal, program it, and ask it,

00:26:33.110 --> 00:26:36.920 align:middle line:84%
please bring my body
into a state of harmony.

00:26:36.920 --> 00:26:38.180 align:middle line:90%
And it will.

00:26:38.180 --> 00:26:40.710 align:middle line:90%
You can use this for healing.

00:26:40.710 --> 00:26:42.480 align:middle line:84%
All you crystal people
are probably, yeah,

00:26:42.480 --> 00:26:45.690 align:middle line:90%
I knew that already.

00:26:45.690 --> 00:26:48.960 align:middle line:84%
And extraterrestrials
communicate with us all the time

00:26:48.960 --> 00:26:50.490 align:middle line:90%
through symbols.

00:26:50.490 --> 00:26:54.780 align:middle line:84%
Down at the bottom, you'll
see this interesting H symbol.

00:26:54.780 --> 00:26:57.780 align:middle line:84%
Now, that comes
from Andromedans.

00:26:57.780 --> 00:27:00.240 align:middle line:84%
They've given my
clients a symbol so

00:27:00.240 --> 00:27:03.370 align:middle line:84%
many times that I
started trying to use it.

00:27:03.370 --> 00:27:06.300 align:middle line:84%
So they said what you
can do with the symbol is

00:27:06.300 --> 00:27:09.900 align:middle line:84%
you can imagine it or visualize
it going through your body.

00:27:09.900 --> 00:27:12.780 align:middle line:90%
And it clears out your toxins.

00:27:12.780 --> 00:27:15.120 align:middle line:84%
They do this to my
clients all the time.

00:27:15.120 --> 00:27:19.170 align:middle line:84%
My clients feel so good after
they go through their body

00:27:19.170 --> 00:27:22.200 align:middle line:84%
and they're removing all
these toxins or removing--

00:27:22.200 --> 00:27:24.390 align:middle line:84%
not only toxins but
different things

00:27:24.390 --> 00:27:26.250 align:middle line:90%
that they don't need anymore.

00:27:26.250 --> 00:27:29.860 align:middle line:84%
And they've said, just imagine
the symbol go through your body

00:27:29.860 --> 00:27:30.660 align:middle line:90%
with it.

00:27:30.660 --> 00:27:35.490 align:middle line:84%
And it's actually working with
your body and cleansing it.

00:27:35.490 --> 00:27:38.130 align:middle line:84%
And all you had to
do was visualize it.

00:27:38.130 --> 00:27:40.230 align:middle line:90%
And it was that powerful.

00:27:40.230 --> 00:27:42.720 align:middle line:90%
And it's from Andromeda.

00:27:42.720 --> 00:27:46.050 align:middle line:84%
So the circle or
the bottom one where

00:27:46.050 --> 00:27:49.410 align:middle line:84%
it's a circle and a dot in
the middle, if any of you

00:27:49.410 --> 00:27:51.720 align:middle line:84%
have a lot of
extraterrestrial contact,

00:27:51.720 --> 00:27:54.210 align:middle line:90%
you might recognize this symbol.

00:27:54.210 --> 00:28:00.570 align:middle line:84%
This symbol is oftentimes used
by the Arcturians and the Greys

00:28:00.570 --> 00:28:02.130 align:middle line:90%
as like a reminder.

00:28:02.130 --> 00:28:03.930 align:middle line:90%
It's a holographic symbol.

00:28:03.930 --> 00:28:06.280 align:middle line:84%
All you have to do is
look at these symbols.

00:28:06.280 --> 00:28:07.080 align:middle line:90%
That's it.

00:28:07.080 --> 00:28:10.500 align:middle line:84%
And it's actually unlocking
something within your mind

00:28:10.500 --> 00:28:12.940 align:middle line:90%
and transmitting information.

00:28:12.940 --> 00:28:17.310 align:middle line:84%
One of the reasons that all
these extraterrestrials use

00:28:17.310 --> 00:28:20.710 align:middle line:84%
this symbol is that there's
nothing you need to do.

00:28:20.710 --> 00:28:22.830 align:middle line:84%
All you have to
do is look at it.

00:28:22.830 --> 00:28:24.870 align:middle line:84%
The circle with a
dot in the middle

00:28:24.870 --> 00:28:28.080 align:middle line:84%
oftentimes is a reminder
that you're here

00:28:28.080 --> 00:28:32.850 align:middle line:84%
as your own point of perspective
within this grand scheme,

00:28:32.850 --> 00:28:34.260 align:middle line:90%
this grand game.

00:28:34.260 --> 00:28:36.360 align:middle line:90%
But you're part of the all.

00:28:36.360 --> 00:28:40.260 align:middle line:84%
But you're just having this
pretend individual experience.

00:28:40.260 --> 00:28:43.050 align:middle line:84%
But as you can see,
you're part of everything,

00:28:43.050 --> 00:28:45.450 align:middle line:90%
just pretending to be this dot.

00:28:45.450 --> 00:28:50.040 align:middle line:84%
Now many ancient societies, they
use the flower of life symbol.

00:28:50.040 --> 00:28:52.620 align:middle line:84%
And it's still used by
extraterrestrials when they're

00:28:52.620 --> 00:28:54.760 align:middle line:90%
communicating all the time.

00:28:54.760 --> 00:28:58.920 align:middle line:84%
So even in Lemuria, they used
the flower of life symbol.

00:28:58.920 --> 00:29:02.670 align:middle line:84%
And basically what they did was
they would meditate with it.

00:29:02.670 --> 00:29:04.620 align:middle line:84%
And it would
download information

00:29:04.620 --> 00:29:07.290 align:middle line:84%
into their minds whatever
they were looking for.

00:29:07.290 --> 00:29:10.320 align:middle line:84%
If you want, just go
ahead and use the symbol.

00:29:10.320 --> 00:29:13.560 align:middle line:84%
And all you have to
do is really meditate

00:29:13.560 --> 00:29:15.570 align:middle line:90%
or relax and look into it.

00:29:15.570 --> 00:29:17.010 align:middle line:90%
Ask a question.

00:29:17.010 --> 00:29:18.570 align:middle line:90%
And see what you get.

00:29:18.570 --> 00:29:21.660 align:middle line:84%
It actually grows your
mind, grows your brain

00:29:21.660 --> 00:29:25.260 align:middle line:84%
to look at these symbols,
the infinity symbols used

00:29:25.260 --> 00:29:27.780 align:middle line:84%
by all the extraterrestrials
when they're

00:29:27.780 --> 00:29:31.110 align:middle line:84%
trying to show my clients
just the nature of reality

00:29:31.110 --> 00:29:34.560 align:middle line:84%
and how there is no
end, no beginning.

00:29:34.560 --> 00:29:36.660 align:middle line:84%
And I'm going to show
you what they showed

00:29:36.660 --> 00:29:42.150 align:middle line:84%
my client after that session he
had remembering being the Greys.

00:29:42.150 --> 00:29:44.400 align:middle line:84%
This is what they told
him or showed him,

00:29:44.400 --> 00:29:47.070 align:middle line:90%
so he wanted to draw it.

00:29:47.070 --> 00:29:49.950 align:middle line:90%
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:29:49.950 --> 00:29:51.390 align:middle line:90%


00:29:51.390 --> 00:29:52.350 align:middle line:90%
- See.

00:29:52.350 --> 00:29:55.070 align:middle line:90%


00:29:55.070 --> 00:29:57.140 align:middle line:90%
You have Earth.

00:29:57.140 --> 00:29:59.450 align:middle line:84%
And then you have-- that's
the shape of Atlantis.

00:29:59.450 --> 00:30:01.840 align:middle line:84%
If you go outside one more,
it's the next evolution.

00:30:01.840 --> 00:30:04.250 align:middle line:84%
And if you connect them
all, it makes the pyramids.

00:30:04.250 --> 00:30:06.148 align:middle line:84%
And also these
different-- there's

00:30:06.148 --> 00:30:07.190 align:middle line:90%
another ring in here too.

00:30:07.190 --> 00:30:08.607 align:middle line:84%
But those are like
time and space.

00:30:08.607 --> 00:30:10.898 align:middle line:84%
It basically means if you
look at it from the top down,

00:30:10.898 --> 00:30:11.750 align:middle line:90%
it's the pyramid.

00:30:11.750 --> 00:30:18.170 align:middle line:84%
And then it's also the
circle dot as well.

00:30:18.170 --> 00:30:21.710 align:middle line:84%
If you were to just
have a dot right there,

00:30:21.710 --> 00:30:26.300 align:middle line:90%
so it'd be right here.

00:30:26.300 --> 00:30:29.330 align:middle line:90%


00:30:29.330 --> 00:30:30.950 align:middle line:84%
Sorry, it's a bad
video and drawing.

00:30:30.950 --> 00:30:31.750 align:middle line:90%
[END PLAYBACK]

00:30:31.750 --> 00:30:35.990 align:middle line:84%
>> So there's been many times
that we have advanced ourselves.

00:30:35.990 --> 00:30:37.940 align:middle line:90%
And then we needed a reset.

00:30:37.940 --> 00:30:41.900 align:middle line:84%
And the reason was because we
didn't do it in full balance.

00:30:41.900 --> 00:30:45.950 align:middle line:84%
We've done this so
many different cycles.

00:30:45.950 --> 00:30:49.100 align:middle line:84%
In fact, most of the people
walking the planet today

00:30:49.100 --> 00:30:51.920 align:middle line:90%
have memories of these places.

00:30:51.920 --> 00:30:55.070 align:middle line:84%
And there's a reason for
that because you're here

00:30:55.070 --> 00:30:58.940 align:middle line:84%
to finally move forward,
release the trauma.

00:30:58.940 --> 00:31:02.750 align:middle line:84%
And we do that through all these
triggers that are around us.

00:31:02.750 --> 00:31:05.480 align:middle line:84%
The triggers help us
release this trauma

00:31:05.480 --> 00:31:09.260 align:middle line:84%
by allowing us or
forcing us to go inwards.

00:31:09.260 --> 00:31:12.800 align:middle line:84%
If you haven't noticed what's
happening on the planet today

00:31:12.800 --> 00:31:16.010 align:middle line:84%
right now is that
everyone is being

00:31:16.010 --> 00:31:21.830 align:middle line:84%
triggered with the one thing
they didn't want to happen.

00:31:21.830 --> 00:31:24.530 align:middle line:90%
So you can't hide from it.

00:31:24.530 --> 00:31:29.180 align:middle line:84%
It's like the one thing
you've really been resisting

00:31:29.180 --> 00:31:32.640 align:middle line:84%
is all of a sudden showing
up in your life right now.

00:31:32.640 --> 00:31:36.510 align:middle line:84%
It's like humanity has
this pressure cooker on it.

00:31:36.510 --> 00:31:37.500 align:middle line:90%
It's like, come on.

00:31:37.500 --> 00:31:39.190 align:middle line:90%
You guys are going to wake up.

00:31:39.190 --> 00:31:41.610 align:middle line:90%
We're going to turn the dial up.

00:31:41.610 --> 00:31:43.380 align:middle line:84%
That's basically
what's happening.

00:31:43.380 --> 00:31:46.680 align:middle line:84%
But there's evidence
throughout all these cultures

00:31:46.680 --> 00:31:50.300 align:middle line:90%
of a more advanced society.

00:31:50.300 --> 00:31:53.690 align:middle line:90%
So now that's all about you.

00:31:53.690 --> 00:31:57.020 align:middle line:90%
Who are you really?

00:31:57.020 --> 00:31:59.720 align:middle line:84%
Well, what's so
fascinating to me

00:31:59.720 --> 00:32:03.200 align:middle line:84%
is that we leave little
clues for ourselves

00:32:03.200 --> 00:32:06.830 align:middle line:90%
as to just who we really are.

00:32:06.830 --> 00:32:09.440 align:middle line:84%
And I had no idea
that we did that.

00:32:09.440 --> 00:32:12.620 align:middle line:84%
And I keep finding out all this
really interesting information

00:32:12.620 --> 00:32:19.220 align:middle line:84%
about different blood types, eye
colors just being little clues.

00:32:19.220 --> 00:32:22.940 align:middle line:84%
Now, one of the
things I wanted to say

00:32:22.940 --> 00:32:26.570 align:middle line:84%
is that when I
started going to Egypt

00:32:26.570 --> 00:32:30.140 align:middle line:84%
and learning a lot about
Egypt and I was learning

00:32:30.140 --> 00:32:33.670 align:middle line:84%
a lot about the
sphinx, I noticed

00:32:33.670 --> 00:32:36.160 align:middle line:84%
that when I was
looking around Egypt,

00:32:36.160 --> 00:32:39.550 align:middle line:84%
there were so many signs,
so many symbols everywhere,

00:32:39.550 --> 00:32:43.030 align:middle line:84%
like hieroglyphs, all
pointing to something.

00:32:43.030 --> 00:32:46.780 align:middle line:84%
And I realized because
the higher consciousness

00:32:46.780 --> 00:32:50.020 align:middle line:90%
said that you are the key.

00:32:50.020 --> 00:32:53.350 align:middle line:90%
You are the clue.

00:32:53.350 --> 00:32:55.160 align:middle line:84%
Everything is
pointing to something.

00:32:55.160 --> 00:32:57.400 align:middle line:84%
You're like, who
am I looking for?

00:32:57.400 --> 00:32:58.570 align:middle line:90%
It's you.

00:32:58.570 --> 00:33:01.930 align:middle line:84%
You're the key that
unlocks everything.

00:33:01.930 --> 00:33:05.320 align:middle line:84%
So see if any of these
things fit for you.

00:33:05.320 --> 00:33:07.570 align:middle line:84%
And see if it takes
you somewhere.

00:33:07.570 --> 00:33:10.210 align:middle line:84%
Now, these are very
general things.

00:33:10.210 --> 00:33:13.600 align:middle line:84%
For many people with
the O blood type,

00:33:13.600 --> 00:33:17.350 align:middle line:84%
they have very deep
memories of Atlantis.

00:33:17.350 --> 00:33:20.770 align:middle line:84%
And they can even tap
into megalithic structures

00:33:20.770 --> 00:33:23.620 align:middle line:84%
if they're from
Atlantis or Egypt.

00:33:23.620 --> 00:33:25.750 align:middle line:84%
Now, what's
interesting is you can

00:33:25.750 --> 00:33:30.110 align:middle line:84%
go to some of these places
like Egypt if you have,

00:33:30.110 --> 00:33:31.750 align:middle line:90%
especially the O blood type.

00:33:31.750 --> 00:33:35.690 align:middle line:84%
Put your hand on some of
these megalithic stones.

00:33:35.690 --> 00:33:39.200 align:middle line:84%
And it will activate
your dormant DNA.

00:33:39.200 --> 00:33:42.560 align:middle line:84%
It's really quite interesting
how this is working.

00:33:42.560 --> 00:33:44.000 align:middle line:90%
Now, this is very general.

00:33:44.000 --> 00:33:47.870 align:middle line:84%
And everybody might be
activated in these places.

00:33:47.870 --> 00:33:51.680 align:middle line:84%
But I'm just telling you what
has been coming through recently

00:33:51.680 --> 00:33:53.900 align:middle line:84%
in sessions, what the
higher consciousness

00:33:53.900 --> 00:33:55.670 align:middle line:84%
and these
extraterrestrials have told

00:33:55.670 --> 00:33:58.430 align:middle line:90%
me are little clues for people.

00:33:58.430 --> 00:34:01.340 align:middle line:84%
If you have the
A blood type, you

00:34:01.340 --> 00:34:08.360 align:middle line:84%
can tap in and read information
about Norse mythology or Norse

00:34:08.360 --> 00:34:11.210 align:middle line:84%
information if you go to
some of these structures,

00:34:11.210 --> 00:34:14.570 align:middle line:84%
say, in Europe by putting
your hands or even

00:34:14.570 --> 00:34:16.489 align:middle line:90%
being in some of these places.

00:34:16.489 --> 00:34:19.639 align:middle line:84%
Another telltale
clue that you have

00:34:19.639 --> 00:34:22.159 align:middle line:84%
this type of DNA
or this information

00:34:22.159 --> 00:34:26.690 align:middle line:84%
or you're a reincarnation of
the fairies or even the druids

00:34:26.690 --> 00:34:28.520 align:middle line:90%
is that you're anemic.

00:34:28.520 --> 00:34:34.340 align:middle line:84%
Now, this is within their
soul DNA to have anemia.

00:34:34.340 --> 00:34:39.469 align:middle line:84%
And the reason is because during
the time of the druids and even

00:34:39.469 --> 00:34:44.900 align:middle line:84%
the fairy kingdom, they
were so upset with iron.

00:34:44.900 --> 00:34:47.179 align:middle line:90%
They couldn't handle iron.

00:34:47.179 --> 00:34:51.500 align:middle line:84%
So it's not your fault
that you can't handle iron.

00:34:51.500 --> 00:34:53.570 align:middle line:90%
It's in your soul DNA.

00:34:53.570 --> 00:34:57.710 align:middle line:84%
But it's a clue because you're
supposed to remember what

00:34:57.710 --> 00:35:00.590 align:middle line:90%
you have access to in your DNA.

00:35:00.590 --> 00:35:06.050 align:middle line:84%
And you could be a reincarnation
of a druid or even a fairy.

00:35:06.050 --> 00:35:08.510 align:middle line:84%
So it's time you
can tell yourself,

00:35:08.510 --> 00:35:10.980 align:middle line:90%
I don't need that clue anymore.

00:35:10.980 --> 00:35:12.680 align:middle line:90%
I can release this anemia.

00:35:12.680 --> 00:35:13.700 align:middle line:90%
I got it.

00:35:13.700 --> 00:35:15.440 align:middle line:90%
I'm safe.

00:35:15.440 --> 00:35:16.730 align:middle line:90%
It's OK.

00:35:16.730 --> 00:35:19.550 align:middle line:84%
Now, the A and B
blood type is usually

00:35:19.550 --> 00:35:26.240 align:middle line:84%
a combination of the Norse
information and Lemuria

00:35:26.240 --> 00:35:27.050 align:middle line:90%
information.

00:35:27.050 --> 00:35:29.060 align:middle line:84%
A lot of people
with B blood type

00:35:29.060 --> 00:35:31.880 align:middle line:84%
can pick up and actually
read information

00:35:31.880 --> 00:35:35.000 align:middle line:90%
from Lemuria or the Pacific.

00:35:35.000 --> 00:35:39.210 align:middle line:84%
So they would want to go to the
pacific to activate their DNA.

00:35:39.210 --> 00:35:43.460 align:middle line:84%
The Rh negative blood type
is so fascinating to me

00:35:43.460 --> 00:35:47.540 align:middle line:84%
because in their
DNA, they actually

00:35:47.540 --> 00:35:50.810 align:middle line:84%
have character traits
for leadership.

00:35:50.810 --> 00:35:54.530 align:middle line:84%
And most of the pharaohs
had Rh negative blood,

00:35:54.530 --> 00:35:56.480 align:middle line:90%
believe it or not.

00:35:56.480 --> 00:36:00.500 align:middle line:84%
In the cosmos, in the
universe, the Rh negative blood

00:36:00.500 --> 00:36:03.800 align:middle line:84%
was considered the
gift of the stars.

00:36:03.800 --> 00:36:05.780 align:middle line:84%
It was considered
the fact that it

00:36:05.780 --> 00:36:09.440 align:middle line:84%
was proven that the
hybridization program would

00:36:09.440 --> 00:36:11.450 align:middle line:90%
work.

00:36:11.450 --> 00:36:13.970 align:middle line:84%
Also what the
extraterrestrials have told

00:36:13.970 --> 00:36:17.510 align:middle line:84%
me is that people
with Rh negative blood

00:36:17.510 --> 00:36:24.140 align:middle line:84%
combined with green eyes and
astigmatism is a huge ability.

00:36:24.140 --> 00:36:28.370 align:middle line:84%
If anybody has any of
these, come see me later

00:36:28.370 --> 00:36:32.720 align:middle line:84%
because astigmatism
is actually an ability

00:36:32.720 --> 00:36:35.170 align:middle line:84%
to see into
different dimensions.

00:36:35.170 --> 00:36:39.880 align:middle line:84%
And I find that so fascinating
that the people with green eyes,

00:36:39.880 --> 00:36:42.610 align:middle line:84%
Rh negative blood,
and astigmatism

00:36:42.610 --> 00:36:46.090 align:middle line:84%
have so many abilities
that we just had--

00:36:46.090 --> 00:36:48.610 align:middle line:90%
who knew?

00:36:48.610 --> 00:36:50.980 align:middle line:90%
Everybody has abilities.

00:36:50.980 --> 00:36:53.770 align:middle line:84%
But I find it so
fascinating that there

00:36:53.770 --> 00:36:56.050 align:middle line:90%
are these genetic markers.

00:36:56.050 --> 00:36:59.590 align:middle line:84%
So your eyes contain the
blueprint of your soul

00:36:59.590 --> 00:37:00.460 align:middle line:90%
apparently.

00:37:00.460 --> 00:37:03.280 align:middle line:84%
If you go and look
in a mirror, you

00:37:03.280 --> 00:37:05.800 align:middle line:84%
can see little lines
around your pupil.

00:37:05.800 --> 00:37:08.990 align:middle line:84%
That's actually the
blueprint of your soul.

00:37:08.990 --> 00:37:11.770 align:middle line:84%
So if you go
investigate your iris

00:37:11.770 --> 00:37:18.280 align:middle line:84%
and you intuitively use your
own intuition or just look,

00:37:18.280 --> 00:37:22.240 align:middle line:84%
it maps out everywhere
your soul has been.

00:37:22.240 --> 00:37:25.150 align:middle line:84%
And you can tell
things about your soul

00:37:25.150 --> 00:37:27.250 align:middle line:90%
by looking at your iris.

00:37:27.250 --> 00:37:32.450 align:middle line:84%
So if you have green
eyes, a lot of the times--

00:37:32.450 --> 00:37:36.050 align:middle line:84%
this very general-- people
are carrying information

00:37:36.050 --> 00:37:38.100 align:middle line:90%
from Lyra with green eyes.

00:37:38.100 --> 00:37:41.450 align:middle line:84%
Green eyes are considered
very, very psychic people

00:37:41.450 --> 00:37:44.750 align:middle line:84%
and bringing almost like
a wind tunnel information

00:37:44.750 --> 00:37:48.970 align:middle line:84%
from these higher realms
down to the Earth plane.

00:37:48.970 --> 00:37:51.970 align:middle line:84%
If you have brown
eyes, brown eyes

00:37:51.970 --> 00:37:56.320 align:middle line:84%
are considered to be very
old souls on the Earth plane

00:37:56.320 --> 00:37:59.150 align:middle line:90%
reincarnated many, many times.

00:37:59.150 --> 00:38:02.140 align:middle line:90%
So there are many visitors here.

00:38:02.140 --> 00:38:03.940 align:middle line:84%
And of course, someone
with brown eyes

00:38:03.940 --> 00:38:07.210 align:middle line:84%
could also be a
volunteer or a visitor.

00:38:07.210 --> 00:38:09.670 align:middle line:84%
And like I said, this
is extremely general.

00:38:09.670 --> 00:38:11.500 align:middle line:84%
But this is what the
higher consciousness

00:38:11.500 --> 00:38:14.900 align:middle line:84%
and the extraterrestrials
have told me, in general,

00:38:14.900 --> 00:38:18.700 align:middle line:84%
people with brown eyes have
reincarnated many times

00:38:18.700 --> 00:38:19.930 align:middle line:90%
on the Earth plane.

00:38:19.930 --> 00:38:24.370 align:middle line:84%
And they would be considered
very old souls, like ancient.

00:38:24.370 --> 00:38:27.700 align:middle line:84%
Also they could be
bringing information

00:38:27.700 --> 00:38:29.380 align:middle line:90%
down into the Middle Earth.

00:38:29.380 --> 00:38:31.420 align:middle line:84%
That would be
another little clue

00:38:31.420 --> 00:38:32.810 align:middle line:90%
you might have given yourself.

00:38:32.810 --> 00:38:35.900 align:middle line:84%
You're the one that's
giving you the clues.

00:38:35.900 --> 00:38:39.280 align:middle line:84%
So if it doesn't fit, then
the clue is not for you,

00:38:39.280 --> 00:38:41.650 align:middle line:84%
so don't shoot the
messenger this life.

00:38:41.650 --> 00:38:46.900 align:middle line:84%
So anyway, blue eyes, generally,
if the bluer they are,

00:38:46.900 --> 00:38:49.790 align:middle line:84%
they're generally
volunteers, not from here.

00:38:49.790 --> 00:38:53.150 align:middle line:84%
They're also considered in
ancient times to be seers.

00:38:53.150 --> 00:38:59.060 align:middle line:84%
Blue eyes do contain within
them an ability to see.

00:38:59.060 --> 00:39:03.890 align:middle line:84%
If you have a little yellow
streak in your blue eye,

00:39:03.890 --> 00:39:06.500 align:middle line:84%
that can often be that
you've been contacted

00:39:06.500 --> 00:39:09.560 align:middle line:84%
or are very connected
with Andromeda.

00:39:09.560 --> 00:39:12.410 align:middle line:84%
Another way you can
tell this is if you

00:39:12.410 --> 00:39:14.990 align:middle line:84%
have dreams of being
on a spaceship,

00:39:14.990 --> 00:39:19.250 align:middle line:84%
being downloaded
mathematics, then

00:39:19.250 --> 00:39:22.880 align:middle line:84%
there is a reason why you also
have that yellow in your eye

00:39:22.880 --> 00:39:26.480 align:middle line:84%
and being communicated
with Andromedans.

00:39:26.480 --> 00:39:30.500 align:middle line:84%
If you have a little crown
right around your pupil,

00:39:30.500 --> 00:39:33.350 align:middle line:84%
that is in general
a telltale sign

00:39:33.350 --> 00:39:36.210 align:middle line:84%
that you are from the
Pleiadian star system,

00:39:36.210 --> 00:39:40.010 align:middle line:84%
and that you are bringing this
information to this realm.

00:39:40.010 --> 00:39:43.430 align:middle line:84%
Now, a lot of
volunteers are here

00:39:43.430 --> 00:39:45.950 align:middle line:84%
to bring the consciousness
of the place where they're

00:39:45.950 --> 00:39:50.120 align:middle line:84%
from onto this Earth plane
because by just simply bringing

00:39:50.120 --> 00:39:54.980 align:middle line:84%
that consciousness or that
personality, so to speak,

00:39:54.980 --> 00:39:56.990 align:middle line:84%
of where you
originate from, it's

00:39:56.990 --> 00:39:59.420 align:middle line:90%
helping the shift of humanity.

00:39:59.420 --> 00:40:01.910 align:middle line:90%
It's helping just by being here.

00:40:01.910 --> 00:40:08.760 align:middle line:84%
Everyone is extremely
important in this Earth shift.

00:40:08.760 --> 00:40:10.720 align:middle line:84%
I think I got all
the eye colors.

00:40:10.720 --> 00:40:15.430 align:middle line:84%
But there are other
signs we leave ourselves.

00:40:15.430 --> 00:40:19.470 align:middle line:10%
So I found it so
fascinating that when

00:40:19.470 --> 00:40:23.190 align:middle line:10%
these extraterrestrials were
talking about all these people

00:40:23.190 --> 00:40:26.580 align:middle line:10%
that were from their
water planet in Sirius.

00:40:26.580 --> 00:40:30.630 align:middle line:84%
They all have a little
beauty mark right there.

00:40:30.630 --> 00:40:33.810 align:middle line:10%
My son also has the same mark.

00:40:33.810 --> 00:40:38.430 align:middle line:10%
And it's so interesting that
it's like a mark that's placed--

00:40:38.430 --> 00:40:41.430 align:middle line:10%
that you place on yourself
to remind yourself

00:40:41.430 --> 00:40:43.830 align:middle line:10%
that you're part of this group.

00:40:43.830 --> 00:40:47.940 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes people have
little freckles that

00:40:47.940 --> 00:40:49.750 align:middle line:90%
form the shape of a triangle.

00:40:49.750 --> 00:40:51.180 align:middle line:90%
And that's a clue too.

00:40:51.180 --> 00:40:53.700 align:middle line:84%
There's a reason why
you have these things.

00:40:53.700 --> 00:40:57.060 align:middle line:84%
And you're supposed to go
investigate for yourself, see

00:40:57.060 --> 00:41:00.450 align:middle line:90%
what rings true to yourself.

00:41:00.450 --> 00:41:04.020 align:middle line:84%
If you can go like this and
that your hand makes an M,

00:41:04.020 --> 00:41:06.690 align:middle line:84%
a lot of times that's
just a literal sign

00:41:06.690 --> 00:41:10.390 align:middle line:84%
that you are carrying
information from Mu or Lemuria.

00:41:10.390 --> 00:41:11.500 align:middle line:90%
I don't have it.

00:41:11.500 --> 00:41:15.410 align:middle line:84%
I am very Atlantean or
have a lot of information

00:41:15.410 --> 00:41:16.210 align:middle line:90%
from Atlantis.

00:41:16.210 --> 00:41:18.070 align:middle line:84%
But if you do, that
could be a sign

00:41:18.070 --> 00:41:20.660 align:middle line:90%
that you brought to yourself.

00:41:20.660 --> 00:41:22.060 align:middle line:90%
So it's interesting.

00:41:22.060 --> 00:41:25.150 align:middle line:84%
You can go investigate
these things for yourself.

00:41:25.150 --> 00:41:31.120 align:middle line:84%
But in conclusion, how do
you become a superhuman?

00:41:31.120 --> 00:41:35.440 align:middle line:84%
You become a superhuman by
being curious about yourself,

00:41:35.440 --> 00:41:39.670 align:middle line:84%
by going into yourself,
finding out who you really are,

00:41:39.670 --> 00:41:42.130 align:middle line:84%
and getting rid of
all this programming

00:41:42.130 --> 00:41:46.045 align:middle line:84%
that people told you that you
were because none of it is true.

00:41:46.045 --> 00:41:50.380 align:middle line:84%
The true nature of reality
is that nothing's here.

00:41:50.380 --> 00:41:53.890 align:middle line:84%
Everything is created
for this experience.

00:41:53.890 --> 00:41:57.670 align:middle line:84%
And then not only that,
when you leave this life

00:41:57.670 --> 00:41:59.800 align:middle line:84%
and you go back
to the in-between,

00:41:59.800 --> 00:42:02.860 align:middle line:84%
you find out you
never left, that this

00:42:02.860 --> 00:42:06.610 align:middle line:84%
is all just an
experience, almost

00:42:06.610 --> 00:42:09.220 align:middle line:90%
like a holographic experience.

00:42:09.220 --> 00:42:11.620 align:middle line:84%
And you were the
creator all along.

00:42:11.620 --> 00:42:14.810 align:middle line:84%
So create something
different for your life

00:42:14.810 --> 00:42:16.180 align:middle line:90%
if you want your life to change.

00:42:16.180 --> 00:42:18.730 align:middle line:90%
Be the victor, not the victim.

00:42:18.730 --> 00:42:20.380 align:middle line:90%
Just go through your life.

00:42:20.380 --> 00:42:24.520 align:middle line:84%
And just analyze all the things
that you've told yourself.

00:42:24.520 --> 00:42:27.640 align:middle line:84%
And go analyze and
see if it's true.

00:42:27.640 --> 00:42:29.740 align:middle line:90%
Anyway, I love all of you guys.

00:42:29.740 --> 00:42:30.940 align:middle line:90%
