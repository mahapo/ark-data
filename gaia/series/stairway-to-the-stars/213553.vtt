00:00:11.480 --> 00:00:14.750 align:middle line:10%
>> So in the time we have left,
I'm going to show you a few

00:00:14.750 --> 00:00:19.940 align:middle line:10%
images here of the kind of
documentation that we look

00:00:19.940 --> 00:00:24.180 align:middle line:10%
at to demonstrate the reality
of these gigantic events.

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:27.230 align:middle line:84%
First, I'm going to show you a
quote from Sir James Hall, one

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:29.040 align:middle line:84%
of the founding
fathers of geology.

00:00:29.040 --> 00:00:31.080 align:middle line:90%
He wrote this back in 1815.

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:33.350 align:middle line:84%
"The facts brought forward
in the following paper,

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:35.270 align:middle line:84%
according to my
view of the subject,

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:39.360 align:middle line:84%
clearly indicate the operation
of immense torrents."

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:42.800 align:middle line:10%
Now, he's been looking
at evidence in Europe.

00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:48.590 align:middle line:10%
And then we jump forward to the
'90s, and we look at the words

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:51.920 align:middle line:10%
of two of the preeminent
paleoclimatologists who have

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:54.710 align:middle line:10%
been studying-- or
paleohydrologists who have been

00:00:54.710 --> 00:00:57.200 align:middle line:10%
studying ancient water flows.

00:00:57.200 --> 00:01:00.650 align:middle line:84%
And by the '90s, they were
able to conclude this, which,

00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:03.440 align:middle line:84%
of course, has not been
refuted, only confirmed.

00:01:03.440 --> 00:01:07.730 align:middle line:84%
Recently identified Pleistocene
flood features in the Eurasian

00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:10.490 align:middle line:90%
continent indicate that--

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:15.200 align:middle line:84%
think about this now-- planetary
scale movement of water

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:17.030 align:middle line:84%
has been a major
agent in shaping

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:19.970 align:middle line:90%
the landscape of our planet.

00:01:19.970 --> 00:01:22.790 align:middle line:10%
Really, almost sounds
biblical to me, doesn't it?

00:01:22.790 --> 00:01:23.980 align:middle line:90%
How about to you?

00:01:23.980 --> 00:01:27.020 align:middle line:84%
Planetary scale
movement of water.

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:28.860 align:middle line:10%
I like to quote
from George Catlin.

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:32.780 align:middle line:10%
This is from his book, "The
Last Rambles Amongst the Indians

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:35.090 align:middle line:10%
of the Rocky Mountains
and the Andes."

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:38.640 align:middle line:84%
And here's the quote that
how he concludes his book.

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:41.900 align:middle line:10%
He spent a lifetime
traveling and living

00:01:41.900 --> 00:01:45.380 align:middle line:10%
with Indigenous peoples all over
the North and South American

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:46.670 align:middle line:10%
continents.

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:49.100 align:middle line:84%
He says, "of 120
different tribes which

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:53.000 align:middle line:84%
I have visited in North and
South and Central America,

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:57.560 align:middle line:84%
every tribe has related to
me, more or less distinctly,

00:01:57.560 --> 00:02:01.940 align:middle line:84%
their traditions of the Deluge,
in which one, or three, or eight

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:04.940 align:middle line:84%
persons were saved above
the waters on the top

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:07.640 align:middle line:84%
of a high mountain; and also,
their peculiar and respective

00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:09.169 align:middle line:90%
theories of Creation.

00:02:09.169 --> 00:02:12.170 align:middle line:84%
Some of these tribes, living at
the base of the Rocky Mountains,

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:15.650 align:middle line:84%
and in the plains of Venezuela,
and the Pampa Del Sacramento

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:18.800 align:middle line:84%
in South America, make annual
pilgrimages to the fancied

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:22.650 align:middle line:84%
summits where the antediluvian
species were saved in canoes

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:25.500 align:middle line:84%
or otherwise, and, under
the mysterious regulations

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:27.270 align:middle line:84%
of their medicine
or mystery men,

00:02:27.270 --> 00:02:30.780 align:middle line:84%
tender their prayers and
sacrifices to the Great Spirit,

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:34.750 align:middle line:84%
to ensure their exemption
from a similar catastrophe."

00:02:34.750 --> 00:02:40.840 align:middle line:10%
Now, how is this evidence
been treated by academia?

00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:41.880 align:middle line:10%
It's been ignored.

00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:44.670 align:middle line:10%
Or, well, there was
missionaries there

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:47.410 align:middle line:10%
who told them the story of
the biblical flood of Noah,

00:02:47.410 --> 00:02:51.550 align:middle line:10%
and they just grafted it onto
their own spiritual heritage.

00:02:51.550 --> 00:02:54.180 align:middle line:10%
But the problem with that
is that most of these tribes

00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:56.400 align:middle line:10%
that he visited, he was
the first white person

00:02:56.400 --> 00:02:59.710 align:middle line:10%
to visit these tribes.

00:02:59.710 --> 00:03:01.960 align:middle line:84%
"How far these general
traditions of a flood

00:03:01.960 --> 00:03:06.100 align:middle line:84%
relate to a universal Deluge,
or to local cataclysms--

00:03:06.100 --> 00:03:09.130 align:middle line:84%
of which there have
evidently been one or more,

00:03:09.130 --> 00:03:11.770 align:middle line:84%
over portions of the
American continent--

00:03:11.770 --> 00:03:14.800 align:middle line:84%
or whether there HAS
BEEN a universal Deluge,

00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:17.630 align:middle line:84%
and at what period, it is
difficult to determine.

00:03:17.630 --> 00:03:20.350 align:middle line:84%
One thing, however, is certain
that the Indian traditions

00:03:20.350 --> 00:03:24.230 align:middle line:84%
everywhere point distinctly
at least to one such event,

00:03:24.230 --> 00:03:26.680 align:middle line:84%
and amongst the Central
and Southern tribes,

00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:29.530 align:middle line:84%
they as distinctly point
to two such catastrophes,

00:03:29.530 --> 00:03:32.470 align:middle line:84%
in which their race
was chiefly destroyed;

00:03:32.470 --> 00:03:35.620 align:middle line:84%
and the rocks of their
countries bear evidence yet more

00:03:35.620 --> 00:03:38.200 align:middle line:84%
conclusive of the
same calamities,

00:03:38.200 --> 00:03:41.950 align:middle line:84%
which probably swept off the
populations of the plains,

00:03:41.950 --> 00:03:45.190 align:middle line:84%
and, as their traditions
say, left scattered remnants

00:03:45.190 --> 00:03:48.580 align:middle line:84%
on the summits of the
Andes and Rocky Mountains."

00:03:48.580 --> 00:03:49.580 align:middle line:90%
Let's keep going on.

00:03:49.580 --> 00:03:52.600 align:middle line:84%
I'm just going to show you a few
examples of what has now been

00:03:52.600 --> 00:03:53.870 align:middle line:90%
preserved in the landscape.

00:03:53.870 --> 00:03:59.150 align:middle line:84%
This is a NASA photograph that
was taken from 500 miles up

00:03:59.150 --> 00:04:00.240 align:middle line:90%
of Eastern Washington.

00:04:00.240 --> 00:04:04.500 align:middle line:84%
And you see these great dark
scars here on the landscape.

00:04:04.500 --> 00:04:07.880 align:middle line:84%
These were water
flows discharging off

00:04:07.880 --> 00:04:10.100 align:middle line:84%
the catastrophically
melting ice sheets

00:04:10.100 --> 00:04:13.040 align:middle line:84%
to the North that can only be
measured in hundreds of millions

00:04:13.040 --> 00:04:15.020 align:middle line:90%
of cubic feet per second.

00:04:15.020 --> 00:04:17.810 align:middle line:84%
The Grand Coulee, this
feature right here,

00:04:17.810 --> 00:04:21.820 align:middle line:84%
had between 300 and 400
million cubic feet per second.

00:04:21.820 --> 00:04:24.350 align:middle line:84%
Now, how do you run your--
how do you wrap your mind

00:04:24.350 --> 00:04:25.995 align:middle line:90%
around something like that?

00:04:25.995 --> 00:04:27.120 align:middle line:10%
Well, think of it this way.

00:04:27.120 --> 00:04:31.310 align:middle line:10%
If you took every continent
and all the flowing water--

00:04:31.310 --> 00:04:34.190 align:middle line:10%
every creek, stream, and river--

00:04:34.190 --> 00:04:37.700 align:middle line:10%
on every continent
on the planet.

00:04:37.700 --> 00:04:40.520 align:middle line:10%
Think of all the great
and mighty rivers,

00:04:40.520 --> 00:04:45.140 align:middle line:10%
from the Nile to the Orinoco,
to the Andes, to the Columbia,

00:04:45.140 --> 00:04:47.310 align:middle line:10%
to the Mississippi.

00:04:47.310 --> 00:04:48.420 align:middle line:10%
All of them--

00:04:48.420 --> 00:04:52.590 align:middle line:10%
Eurasia, North America,
South America-- every river,

00:04:52.590 --> 00:04:57.310 align:middle line:10%
every flowing water on Earth,
you wouldn't even have 1/10

00:04:57.310 --> 00:04:58.965 align:middle line:10%
the volume that
created Grand Coulee.

00:04:58.965 --> 00:05:01.692 align:middle line:10%


00:05:01.692 --> 00:05:03.400 align:middle line:10%
You can confirm-- if
you do the research,

00:05:03.400 --> 00:05:04.820 align:middle line:10%
you can confirm this yourself.

00:05:04.820 --> 00:05:07.040 align:middle line:10%
I don't need to
exaggerate anything here.

00:05:07.040 --> 00:05:11.710 align:middle line:10%
So what I'm doing, though,
is I am organizing,

00:05:11.710 --> 00:05:14.210 align:middle line:10%
with the help of my
colleagues and associates,

00:05:14.210 --> 00:05:18.250 align:middle line:10%
we've been organizing tours
and groups to take people out

00:05:18.250 --> 00:05:21.100 align:middle line:10%
so that I can teach
them how to read

00:05:21.100 --> 00:05:24.555 align:middle line:10%
the landscapes of catastrophe.

00:05:24.555 --> 00:05:26.430 align:middle line:84%
And here you can see on
this color variation,

00:05:26.430 --> 00:05:28.060 align:middle line:90%
they show up very clearly.

00:05:28.060 --> 00:05:33.390 align:middle line:10%
Here is two great scars in
the surface of the Earth.

00:05:33.390 --> 00:05:40.850 align:middle line:10%
And here, this quote I think
seems to be relevant to this.

00:05:40.850 --> 00:05:43.112 align:middle line:10%
"The waters prevailed
exceedingly upon the earth;

00:05:43.112 --> 00:05:44.820 align:middle line:10%
and all the high
mountains were covered."

00:05:44.820 --> 00:05:46.040 align:middle line:10%
Now, if you look
carefully on this--

00:05:46.040 --> 00:05:47.790 align:middle line:10%
I can't see it too
well up here, hopefully

00:05:47.790 --> 00:05:49.760 align:middle line:10%
you can see it better
up on the screen--

00:05:49.760 --> 00:05:53.980 align:middle line:10%
there are shorelines right up
to the top of this mountain.

00:05:53.980 --> 00:05:58.270 align:middle line:10%
And that shows where the waters
rose up almost to the very top

00:05:58.270 --> 00:06:02.460 align:middle line:10%
of the mountain over 1,000 feet
deep, and then drained away.

00:06:02.460 --> 00:06:05.730 align:middle line:90%


00:06:05.730 --> 00:06:07.660 align:middle line:90%
Here's another example.

00:06:07.660 --> 00:06:10.300 align:middle line:84%
If you look carefully,
you'll see horizontal lines.

00:06:10.300 --> 00:06:12.050 align:middle line:10%
Those are shorelines.

00:06:12.050 --> 00:06:14.720 align:middle line:10%
That's one of the evidence,
one of the signatures

00:06:14.720 --> 00:06:18.440 align:middle line:10%
of these gigantic fluvial
events that have been

00:06:18.440 --> 00:06:21.670 align:middle line:10%
preserved in the landscape.

00:06:21.670 --> 00:06:24.640 align:middle line:10%
They show up very clearly
here because in the spring,

00:06:24.640 --> 00:06:27.640 align:middle line:10%
snow melt has defined
the shorelines, which,

00:06:27.640 --> 00:06:32.940 align:middle line:10%
in geological lingo,
is called strand lines.

00:06:32.940 --> 00:06:35.290 align:middle line:10%
And here you have
current rippled sand.

00:06:35.290 --> 00:06:39.930 align:middle line:10%
I took this picture back in
the aftermath of Hurricane Ivan

00:06:39.930 --> 00:06:44.300 align:middle line:10%
flooding, which was considered
to be a 100-year flood in North

00:06:44.300 --> 00:06:45.100 align:middle line:10%
Georgia.

00:06:45.100 --> 00:06:48.100 align:middle line:84%
And you look here, you
can see current ripples.

00:06:48.100 --> 00:06:49.720 align:middle line:84%
Now, I've got a
measuring tape here.

00:06:49.720 --> 00:06:53.020 align:middle line:10%
You can see the amplitude
is about 3/4 of an inch.

00:06:53.020 --> 00:06:56.650 align:middle line:10%
The wavelength is a
couple of 2 to 3 inches.

00:06:56.650 --> 00:06:58.710 align:middle line:10%
The water that created
this on the flood

00:06:58.710 --> 00:07:01.440 align:middle line:10%
plain, which had not been
submerged for decades,

00:07:01.440 --> 00:07:04.780 align:middle line:10%
was 2 feet deep.

00:07:04.780 --> 00:07:07.850 align:middle line:84%
Now if you look at this,
this is an aerial photograph

00:07:07.850 --> 00:07:12.910 align:middle line:84%
I took over a place called Camas
prairie in western Montana.

00:07:12.910 --> 00:07:19.180 align:middle line:84%
And you have a ripple train
there that's 5 to 6 miles long.

00:07:19.180 --> 00:07:23.680 align:middle line:84%
And the largest ripples
are 30 to 50 feet high,

00:07:23.680 --> 00:07:26.590 align:middle line:90%
and 200 to 300 feet wavelength.

00:07:26.590 --> 00:07:30.610 align:middle line:84%
And we can find the strand
lines on the nearest mountains.

00:07:30.610 --> 00:07:34.480 align:middle line:84%
And we can see that the water
that passed over this land was

00:07:34.480 --> 00:07:36.720 align:middle line:90%
1,400 feet deep.

00:07:36.720 --> 00:07:39.430 align:middle line:10%
So try to imagine, if
you will, a rushing,

00:07:39.430 --> 00:07:42.850 align:middle line:10%
raging river moving at
40 or 50 miles an hour,

00:07:42.850 --> 00:07:48.180 align:middle line:10%
choked with icebergs, and it's 5
to 10 miles wide and 1,400 feet

00:07:48.180 --> 00:07:48.980 align:middle line:10%
deep.

00:07:48.980 --> 00:07:54.880 align:middle line:90%


00:07:54.880 --> 00:07:57.070 align:middle line:84%
Here are a couple of hundred
miles away to the west,

00:07:57.070 --> 00:08:00.250 align:middle line:84%
you have a gigantic
gravel boulder bar.

00:08:00.250 --> 00:08:01.400 align:middle line:90%
It's 3 miles long.

00:08:01.400 --> 00:08:02.750 align:middle line:90%
It's 200 feet thick.

00:08:02.750 --> 00:08:06.600 align:middle line:84%
And, again, the same
scale of current ripples.

00:08:06.600 --> 00:08:09.390 align:middle line:10%
This was the same
flood which submerged

00:08:09.390 --> 00:08:15.840 align:middle line:10%
large portions of four states
and two provinces of Canada.

00:08:15.840 --> 00:08:19.900 align:middle line:10%
Now, if there were survivors--
and there were probably a few

00:08:19.900 --> 00:08:21.250 align:middle line:10%
by the luck of the draw--

00:08:21.250 --> 00:08:25.020 align:middle line:10%
what kind of stories would they
tell about an event like this?

00:08:25.020 --> 00:08:27.650 align:middle line:90%


00:08:27.650 --> 00:08:29.960 align:middle line:84%
And then in those flood
waters, like I said,

00:08:29.960 --> 00:08:32.880 align:middle line:90%
you had thousands of icebergs.

00:08:32.880 --> 00:08:35.640 align:middle line:10%
Because simultaneous with
the melting of the ice,

00:08:35.640 --> 00:08:37.659 align:middle line:10%
it's breaking up,
it's shattering.

00:08:37.659 --> 00:08:39.840 align:middle line:10%
And these icebergs,
chunks of ice

00:08:39.840 --> 00:08:43.530 align:middle line:10%
are being swept out by the
raging flood waters discharging

00:08:43.530 --> 00:08:44.790 align:middle line:10%
from the ice.

00:08:44.790 --> 00:08:46.440 align:middle line:10%
Well, a lot of that--

00:08:46.440 --> 00:08:49.440 align:middle line:10%
a lot of those
icebergs have picked up

00:08:49.440 --> 00:08:51.880 align:middle line:10%
these gigantic boulders
like this one here.

00:08:51.880 --> 00:08:54.240 align:middle line:10%
And if you look at this,
you see that this boulder--

00:08:54.240 --> 00:08:56.970 align:middle line:10%
and in the second, I'm going to
put a couple of people in there

00:08:56.970 --> 00:08:57.850 align:middle line:10%
for scale.

00:08:57.850 --> 00:08:59.308 align:middle line:10%
But you can see
they're all the way

00:08:59.308 --> 00:09:02.910 align:middle line:10%
up here to the top of these huge
hills, over thousand feet up.

00:09:02.910 --> 00:09:05.880 align:middle line:10%
Now, let's add
some people so you

00:09:05.880 --> 00:09:09.460 align:middle line:10%
can get a sense of how
large that boulder is.

00:09:09.460 --> 00:09:12.030 align:middle line:10%
Now, how did that
boulder get there?

00:09:12.030 --> 00:09:16.710 align:middle line:10%
Well, here was an interesting--
this was from an artist in 1872

00:09:16.710 --> 00:09:19.540 align:middle line:10%
who I ran across this, and
I says, well, there it is.

00:09:19.540 --> 00:09:22.320 align:middle line:10%
You have the raging floodwaters,
you have the icebergs,

00:09:22.320 --> 00:09:25.560 align:middle line:10%
and then you have the cargo of
giant erratic boulders being

00:09:25.560 --> 00:09:27.620 align:middle line:10%
carried on the icebergs.

00:09:27.620 --> 00:09:34.310 align:middle line:10%
And that is how you
got this, and this.

00:09:34.310 --> 00:09:36.180 align:middle line:10%
That is a really big rock.

00:09:36.180 --> 00:09:40.670 align:middle line:10%
Now, this is stranded 400 feet
above the modern Columbia River.

00:09:40.670 --> 00:09:43.320 align:middle line:10%
And scattered over
thousands of square miles,

00:09:43.320 --> 00:09:44.500 align:middle line:10%
you find stuff like this.

00:09:44.500 --> 00:09:47.940 align:middle line:90%


00:09:47.940 --> 00:09:51.160 align:middle line:10%
Huge boulders littering
the landscape.

00:09:51.160 --> 00:09:53.760 align:middle line:10%
And this is the evidence
that these floodwaters

00:09:53.760 --> 00:09:56.670 align:middle line:10%
swept over these landscapes.

00:09:56.670 --> 00:10:02.130 align:middle line:10%
This is a topographic map of a
gigantic flood eroded feature

00:10:02.130 --> 00:10:04.000 align:middle line:10%
called Dry Falls Cataract.

00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:05.560 align:middle line:10%
It's 5 miles wide.

00:10:05.560 --> 00:10:09.480 align:middle line:84%
The cliffs here in these
alcoves are 400 feet high.

00:10:09.480 --> 00:10:13.390 align:middle line:10%
You understand Niagara
Falls is a cataract.

00:10:13.390 --> 00:10:14.230 align:middle line:10%
It's very similar.

00:10:14.230 --> 00:10:17.310 align:middle line:10%
It has the classical
horseshoe-shaped profile.

00:10:17.310 --> 00:10:21.690 align:middle line:10%
Well, if you look at this
aerial, this is one alcove.

00:10:21.690 --> 00:10:25.320 align:middle line:10%
That right there
is this second--

00:10:25.320 --> 00:10:28.080 align:middle line:10%
you're looking at this
second alcove right here.

00:10:28.080 --> 00:10:31.470 align:middle line:10%
Now what I'm going to do
is I'm going to superimpose

00:10:31.470 --> 00:10:34.010 align:middle line:10%
Niagara Falls at scale.

00:10:34.010 --> 00:10:39.390 align:middle line:10%
So this is 2 and 1/2 times the
height and many times the width.

00:10:39.390 --> 00:10:42.690 align:middle line:10%
So we're going to go through
these quickly so that you

00:10:42.690 --> 00:10:45.720 align:middle line:10%
can see for yourself some of the
magnitude of the features left

00:10:45.720 --> 00:10:48.430 align:middle line:10%
in the landscape.

00:10:48.430 --> 00:10:53.470 align:middle line:10%
The erosion rips up bedrock, in
the formation of Grand Coulee.

00:10:53.470 --> 00:10:55.990 align:middle line:10%
The bedrock that was
ripped up was scattered

00:10:55.990 --> 00:10:57.538 align:middle line:10%
over a thousand square mile.

00:10:57.538 --> 00:10:58.580 align:middle line:10%
And this is what you see.

00:10:58.580 --> 00:11:01.270 align:middle line:10%
This is the rubble,
literally, of the former world

00:11:01.270 --> 00:11:02.730 align:middle line:10%
you're looking at right here.

00:11:02.730 --> 00:11:05.110 align:middle line:10%
Now, I'm just showing
you one particular place.

00:11:05.110 --> 00:11:08.610 align:middle line:10%
This is now in Northern Idaho.

00:11:08.610 --> 00:11:10.290 align:middle line:10%
Sorry, this is Southern Idaho.

00:11:10.290 --> 00:11:13.870 align:middle line:10%
And this was a flood
coming up out of Utah.

00:11:13.870 --> 00:11:16.300 align:middle line:10%
The carved, the
modern Snake River.

00:11:16.300 --> 00:11:17.490 align:middle line:10%
And you can see--

00:11:17.490 --> 00:11:20.160 align:middle line:10%
just try to imagine
the power of the water

00:11:20.160 --> 00:11:22.295 align:middle line:10%
flows that are transporting
rocks like this.

00:11:22.295 --> 00:11:25.510 align:middle line:90%


00:11:25.510 --> 00:11:27.190 align:middle line:10%
So we're just going
to go through now.

00:11:27.190 --> 00:11:34.290 align:middle line:10%
In these turbulent waters, you
have this happening-- vortexes.

00:11:34.290 --> 00:11:38.010 align:middle line:10%
Powerful vortexes, like
tornadoes in water.

00:11:38.010 --> 00:11:40.500 align:middle line:90%
They pick up debris.

00:11:40.500 --> 00:11:44.550 align:middle line:10%
And they can literally drill,
in a few hours or a few days,

00:11:44.550 --> 00:11:49.720 align:middle line:10%
deep holes into bedrock.

00:11:49.720 --> 00:11:53.590 align:middle line:10%
This is, I'm in the
bottom of a pothole.

00:11:53.590 --> 00:11:55.450 align:middle line:10%
Here, it's actually
80 feet deep,

00:11:55.450 --> 00:11:59.930 align:middle line:10%
but it's got 25 feet of sediment
accumulated in the bottom.

00:11:59.930 --> 00:12:01.565 align:middle line:90%
It's like 15 feet wide.

00:12:01.565 --> 00:12:02.690 align:middle line:90%
I'm standing in the bottom.

00:12:02.690 --> 00:12:06.550 align:middle line:84%
This is Graham Hancock
looking over the rim.

00:12:06.550 --> 00:12:09.850 align:middle line:84%
So this was one of the last
places I brought Graham to show

00:12:09.850 --> 00:12:13.550 align:middle line:84%
him when he was researching
"Magicians of the Gods."

00:12:13.550 --> 00:12:15.920 align:middle line:10%
But this, again,
is just testimony

00:12:15.920 --> 00:12:20.750 align:middle line:10%
to the-- mute testimony to
the extremely inconceivable

00:12:20.750 --> 00:12:22.440 align:middle line:10%
powerful flows.

00:12:22.440 --> 00:12:25.880 align:middle line:10%
Now, this is on the border
of Minnesota and Wisconsin.

00:12:25.880 --> 00:12:28.070 align:middle line:10%
We could go over the
whole United States,

00:12:28.070 --> 00:12:30.180 align:middle line:10%
Canada, Northwestern Europe.

00:12:30.180 --> 00:12:31.970 align:middle line:10%
In fact, there's not
a continent on Earth

00:12:31.970 --> 00:12:35.630 align:middle line:10%
that doesn't have similar
kinds of evidence.

00:12:35.630 --> 00:12:38.580 align:middle line:10%
Now, I'm not necessarily saying
it's from the same water flow.

00:12:38.580 --> 00:12:40.410 align:middle line:10%
This is from upper
New York State.

00:12:40.410 --> 00:12:42.540 align:middle line:10%
This is at the south
end of the Finger Lakes.

00:12:42.540 --> 00:12:45.530 align:middle line:10%
And you can see there
was a gorge here

00:12:45.530 --> 00:12:47.170 align:middle line:10%
that was cut by water flows.

00:12:47.170 --> 00:12:48.920 align:middle line:10%
And right there at the
bottom of the gorge

00:12:48.920 --> 00:12:51.690 align:middle line:10%
is a huge circular deep pothole.

00:12:51.690 --> 00:12:55.130 align:middle line:84%
And the 6 inches to 1 foot
of water flowing there now

00:12:55.130 --> 00:12:57.260 align:middle line:90%
did not create that pothole.

00:12:57.260 --> 00:12:58.270 align:middle line:90%
That's the takeaway.

00:12:58.270 --> 00:13:01.200 align:middle line:90%


00:13:01.200 --> 00:13:04.050 align:middle line:10%
This is up in the
Southern Appalachians.

00:13:04.050 --> 00:13:08.010 align:middle line:10%
And you can see that there are
huge rounded boulders all strewn

00:13:08.010 --> 00:13:11.670 align:middle line:10%
throughout the hollows of
the southern Appalachians.

00:13:11.670 --> 00:13:14.460 align:middle line:10%
And, again, as it says
here, massive displaced

00:13:14.460 --> 00:13:18.360 align:middle line:10%
boulders at Bonas Defeat, in
the headwaters of the Tuckasegee

00:13:18.360 --> 00:13:20.390 align:middle line:10%
River, North Carolina.

00:13:20.390 --> 00:13:26.740 align:middle line:10%
And all of these hollows
show this kind of evidence.

00:13:26.740 --> 00:13:27.980 align:middle line:10%
Here's a waterfall.

00:13:27.980 --> 00:13:29.920 align:middle line:10%
And let me assure
you that feature

00:13:29.920 --> 00:13:32.620 align:middle line:10%
with the massive
undercutting there was not

00:13:32.620 --> 00:13:36.520 align:middle line:10%
formed by the modern waterfall.

00:13:36.520 --> 00:13:39.167 align:middle line:10%
And here is just a cross-section
to give you an idea.

00:13:39.167 --> 00:13:40.750 align:middle line:10%
This could be, I
think I used Atlanta,

00:13:40.750 --> 00:13:43.812 align:middle line:10%
but it could be-- it could be
Las Vegas, it could be any city.

00:13:43.812 --> 00:13:46.270 align:middle line:10%
This is a typical flow through
some of the western mountain

00:13:46.270 --> 00:13:47.260 align:middle line:10%
valleys.

00:13:47.260 --> 00:13:50.410 align:middle line:84%
And what I did there
was I put the skyline

00:13:50.410 --> 00:13:53.150 align:middle line:90%
of a major urban city.

00:13:53.150 --> 00:13:56.020 align:middle line:84%
Like I said, this
could be Las Vegas.

00:13:56.020 --> 00:13:58.110 align:middle line:90%
It could be any major city.

00:13:58.110 --> 00:14:00.110 align:middle line:84%
It could be Washington,
DC, it could be Atlanta.

00:14:00.110 --> 00:14:02.830 align:middle line:84%
I think used Atlanta,
and it's to scale.

00:14:02.830 --> 00:14:06.590 align:middle line:84%
And I think this
might be Denver.

00:14:06.590 --> 00:14:09.490 align:middle line:84%
I think I did a
presentation in Denver.

00:14:09.490 --> 00:14:13.570 align:middle line:10%
And there you can see the depth
of some of these water flows.

00:14:13.570 --> 00:14:16.450 align:middle line:10%
So ask yourself-- if
a water flow like this

00:14:16.450 --> 00:14:20.140 align:middle line:10%
came across any urban
landscape, what would be left?

00:14:20.140 --> 00:14:21.790 align:middle line:90%
Not a damn thing.

00:14:21.790 --> 00:14:23.740 align:middle line:84%
This is why archaeologists
are finding--

00:14:23.740 --> 00:14:24.670 align:middle line:90%
this is the thing.

00:14:24.670 --> 00:14:26.800 align:middle line:10%
Well, where's the pottery?

00:14:26.800 --> 00:14:28.190 align:middle line:90%
Where's the evidence.

00:14:28.190 --> 00:14:30.743 align:middle line:90%


00:14:30.743 --> 00:14:32.660 align:middle line:10%
Well, I'm going to speed
through some of this.

00:14:32.660 --> 00:14:34.450 align:middle line:10%
This is my colleague
and friend, Brad.

00:14:34.450 --> 00:14:35.380 align:middle line:10%
He's standing up here.

00:14:35.380 --> 00:14:40.120 align:middle line:10%
This is in-- this is in New
Mexico, in the Jemez River.

00:14:40.120 --> 00:14:42.340 align:middle line:10%
And this is a rounded
8-foot boulder.

00:14:42.340 --> 00:14:45.750 align:middle line:10%
And you walk up miles up
this little river choked

00:14:45.750 --> 00:14:47.513 align:middle line:10%
with these gigantic boulders.

00:14:47.513 --> 00:14:48.430 align:middle line:90%
He's standing up here.

00:14:48.430 --> 00:14:51.490 align:middle line:90%
I don't know if you can see him.

00:14:51.490 --> 00:14:53.540 align:middle line:10%
Cumberland River in Kentucky.

00:14:53.540 --> 00:14:55.100 align:middle line:10%
Again, gigantic boulders.

00:14:55.100 --> 00:14:57.520 align:middle line:10%
And here, this is spectacular.

00:14:57.520 --> 00:14:59.350 align:middle line:10%
If you look at this,
this is Lake Superior,

00:14:59.350 --> 00:15:00.890 align:middle line:10%
the biggest of the Great Lakes.

00:15:00.890 --> 00:15:04.210 align:middle line:10%
And you can see here
very clearly defined

00:15:04.210 --> 00:15:08.440 align:middle line:10%
in this digital elevation
model, the gigantic flows

00:15:08.440 --> 00:15:12.720 align:middle line:10%
of these catastrophically
melting ice sheets.

00:15:12.720 --> 00:15:16.590 align:middle line:10%
You can see the flow parted
right here and pretty much

00:15:16.590 --> 00:15:21.520 align:middle line:10%
created the whole delta now
that New Orleans is built upon.

00:15:21.520 --> 00:15:25.790 align:middle line:10%
And this is in Siberia.

00:15:25.790 --> 00:15:29.630 align:middle line:10%
And we could spend hours going
through the evidence showing

00:15:29.630 --> 00:15:31.610 align:middle line:10%
that these events were global.

00:15:31.610 --> 00:15:34.500 align:middle line:10%
I'm going to just really
speed through some of this

00:15:34.500 --> 00:15:35.300 align:middle line:10%
so you can just--

00:15:35.300 --> 00:15:37.880 align:middle line:10%
I just want you to
take away from this--

00:15:37.880 --> 00:15:42.290 align:middle line:10%
because the evidence
is accumulating

00:15:42.290 --> 00:15:48.840 align:middle line:10%
that the cosmic factor has been
crucial to this whole phenomena.

00:15:48.840 --> 00:15:51.570 align:middle line:10%
I mean, if we look at--

00:15:51.570 --> 00:15:55.320 align:middle line:10%
if we look at the moon, if
we look at the inner planets,

00:15:55.320 --> 00:15:56.330 align:middle line:10%
what do we see?

00:15:56.330 --> 00:15:57.990 align:middle line:84%
The most ubiquitous
surface feature

00:15:57.990 --> 00:16:02.170 align:middle line:84%
is impact cratering,
impact scars, astro beams.

00:16:02.170 --> 00:16:07.640 align:middle line:10%
So I do a whole lecture on
this and it's available online.

00:16:07.640 --> 00:16:10.790 align:middle line:84%
I would highly recommend that
you looked at it, study it.

00:16:10.790 --> 00:16:12.610 align:middle line:84%
I'm just going to go
through some of these

00:16:12.610 --> 00:16:14.030 align:middle line:90%
so you can get an idea.

00:16:14.030 --> 00:16:15.280 align:middle line:90%
Upheaval Dome, Utah.

00:16:15.280 --> 00:16:17.680 align:middle line:84%
We've led expeditions
to this feature.

00:16:17.680 --> 00:16:19.430 align:middle line:90%
6 miles in diameter.

00:16:19.430 --> 00:16:23.260 align:middle line:10%
The explosive energy of that,
6,000 mega tons are the same

00:16:23.260 --> 00:16:25.960 align:middle line:10%
as 400,000 Hiroshima bombs.

00:16:25.960 --> 00:16:27.460 align:middle line:10%
We can go through here.

00:16:27.460 --> 00:16:28.300 align:middle line:10%
This is in Chad.

00:16:28.300 --> 00:16:32.710 align:middle line:10%
10.2 miles, explosive
energy, 36,000 megatons,

00:16:32.710 --> 00:16:35.840 align:middle line:10%
2.4 million Hiroshimas.

00:16:35.840 --> 00:16:38.785 align:middle line:10%
Now you want to talk about
where could the energy come from

00:16:38.785 --> 00:16:40.160 align:middle line:10%
to trigger these
kinds of things.

00:16:40.160 --> 00:16:41.243 align:middle line:10%
I'll tell you where it is.

00:16:41.243 --> 00:16:43.282 align:middle line:10%
We are part of a
cosmic ecosystem.

00:16:43.282 --> 00:16:45.740 align:middle line:10%
That is one of the lessons you
need to take away from this.

00:16:45.740 --> 00:16:47.750 align:middle line:10%
And we need to start
thinking cosmically.

00:16:47.750 --> 00:16:51.010 align:middle line:10%
We need to start thinking that
we are part of a much grander,

00:16:51.010 --> 00:16:52.370 align:middle line:10%
larger system.

00:16:52.370 --> 00:16:56.900 align:middle line:10%
And like our ancestors
understood, I think clearly.

00:16:56.900 --> 00:16:59.530 align:middle line:10%
Tunguska, I'm sure all of
you have heard of Tunguska

00:16:59.530 --> 00:17:00.710 align:middle line:10%
and the event there.

00:17:00.710 --> 00:17:05.180 align:middle line:10%
That was the equivalent of a 15
megaton hydrogen bomb explosion,

00:17:05.180 --> 00:17:07.910 align:middle line:10%
which was the largest
nuclear bomb ever tested

00:17:07.910 --> 00:17:09.599 align:middle line:10%
by the United States.

00:17:09.599 --> 00:17:11.510 align:middle line:10%
And then there was, some
of you will remember

00:17:11.510 --> 00:17:15.859 align:middle line:10%
the String of Pearls, when
Shoemaker/Levy 9 plummeted

00:17:15.859 --> 00:17:18.740 align:middle line:10%
into Jupiter back in 1994.

00:17:18.740 --> 00:17:23.810 align:middle line:84%
And there's evidence now that
these are important types

00:17:23.810 --> 00:17:26.079 align:middle line:90%
of impact events.

00:17:26.079 --> 00:17:27.849 align:middle line:84%
We shall be led to
propose that over

00:17:27.849 --> 00:17:30.120 align:middle line:84%
and above the sporadic
impacts already discussed,

00:17:30.120 --> 00:17:32.740 align:middle line:84%
there may have been brief
periods within historic times

00:17:32.740 --> 00:17:36.860 align:middle line:84%
of greatly increased
Tunguska-like bombardment.

00:17:36.860 --> 00:17:39.970 align:middle line:10%
Now, this is not to
cause us to despair,

00:17:39.970 --> 00:17:42.400 align:middle line:10%
but it's like we
need to understand

00:17:42.400 --> 00:17:44.710 align:middle line:10%
that these are forces
of nature to which we

00:17:44.710 --> 00:17:46.220 align:middle line:10%
are vulnerable at present.

00:17:46.220 --> 00:17:51.790 align:middle line:10%
But very shortly, with awareness
of this and the motivation,

00:17:51.790 --> 00:17:54.160 align:middle line:10%
we don't have to be
vulnerable anymore.

00:17:54.160 --> 00:17:55.990 align:middle line:10%
And I wish we had
more time because I

00:17:55.990 --> 00:17:57.790 align:middle line:10%
would love to go through
this, but I'm just

00:17:57.790 --> 00:17:59.320 align:middle line:10%
going to very briefly.

00:17:59.320 --> 00:18:01.900 align:middle line:84%
This is what's been going
on while the majority

00:18:01.900 --> 00:18:05.570 align:middle line:84%
of the population has not
been paying attention.

00:18:05.570 --> 00:18:10.310 align:middle line:84%
So just look at the headlines
as we go through here.

00:18:10.310 --> 00:18:29.205 align:middle line:90%


00:18:29.205 --> 00:18:30.005 align:middle line:90%
See?

00:18:30.005 --> 00:18:33.460 align:middle line:90%


00:18:33.460 --> 00:18:37.220 align:middle line:10%
And it goes on and on and on.

00:18:37.220 --> 00:18:40.400 align:middle line:84%
These are all separate events
that I've been keeping track of

00:18:40.400 --> 00:18:43.810 align:middle line:84%
and cataloging for a
quarter of a century now.

00:18:43.810 --> 00:18:57.980 align:middle line:90%


00:18:57.980 --> 00:19:01.000 align:middle line:90%
But I want to end with this.

00:19:01.000 --> 00:19:02.680 align:middle line:84%
Because right now,
we're on the brink

00:19:02.680 --> 00:19:04.510 align:middle line:90%
of a new industrial landscape.

00:19:04.510 --> 00:19:07.480 align:middle line:84%
And it's a recovery
of an ancient science.

00:19:07.480 --> 00:19:10.840 align:middle line:84%
And it's being tested
right now as we speak.

00:19:10.840 --> 00:19:13.480 align:middle line:10%
And I have been privy
to this knowledge,

00:19:13.480 --> 00:19:16.940 align:middle line:10%
this information for eight years
now and been sitting on it.

00:19:16.940 --> 00:19:18.940 align:middle line:10%
And finally, now I'm
able, in a position.

00:19:18.940 --> 00:19:21.790 align:middle line:10%
Since the reveal on
Joe Rogan one year

00:19:21.790 --> 00:19:25.570 align:middle line:10%
ago this month, things
have gone completely crazy.

00:19:25.570 --> 00:19:31.570 align:middle line:10%
And this new technology, which
is a recovery, like I said,

00:19:31.570 --> 00:19:34.990 align:middle line:10%
it's based on plasma and
the control of plasma.

00:19:34.990 --> 00:19:36.840 align:middle line:84%
And these are
examples of plasma.

00:19:36.840 --> 00:19:41.140 align:middle line:90%


00:19:41.140 --> 00:19:45.400 align:middle line:10%
And when we have solar
storms that wipe out things,

00:19:45.400 --> 00:19:47.980 align:middle line:10%
those are gigantic
plasma blobs that

00:19:47.980 --> 00:19:51.050 align:middle line:10%
are being thrown off the sun.

00:19:51.050 --> 00:19:54.080 align:middle line:84%
But plasmas have an affinity
for certain geometrical

00:19:54.080 --> 00:19:54.900 align:middle line:90%
relationships.

00:19:54.900 --> 00:19:58.380 align:middle line:84%
So this is called a
Ranque-Hilsch vortex tube.

00:19:58.380 --> 00:19:59.540 align:middle line:90%
And it's a way--

00:19:59.540 --> 00:20:02.030 align:middle line:84%
it's an amazing thing that
nobody really understands

00:20:02.030 --> 00:20:03.210 align:middle line:90%
how it works, but it works.

00:20:03.210 --> 00:20:05.060 align:middle line:10%
And it's being
used in industry--

00:20:05.060 --> 00:20:08.870 align:middle line:10%
refrigeration, air
conditioning, nuclear reactors.

00:20:08.870 --> 00:20:12.440 align:middle line:10%
And what it does is you feed
a compressed air at room

00:20:12.440 --> 00:20:16.310 align:middle line:10%
temperature into this swirl
chamber at high rates of speed

00:20:16.310 --> 00:20:18.120 align:middle line:10%
and it sets up a vortex.

00:20:18.120 --> 00:20:21.600 align:middle line:84%
And one vortex will travel
down towards the end.

00:20:21.600 --> 00:20:23.850 align:middle line:84%
And as it does, it
gets hotter and hotter.

00:20:23.850 --> 00:20:27.050 align:middle line:84%
And then this cone
at the end here,

00:20:27.050 --> 00:20:31.640 align:middle line:84%
the control valve separates
the hot and the cold.

00:20:31.640 --> 00:20:34.130 align:middle line:84%
The hot air comes out
one end, the cold air

00:20:34.130 --> 00:20:39.110 align:middle line:84%
is reversed and goes in another
vortex in the opposite--

00:20:39.110 --> 00:20:40.530 align:middle line:90%
in the opposite direction.

00:20:40.530 --> 00:20:42.900 align:middle line:84%
So you have clockwise
and counterclockwise.

00:20:42.900 --> 00:20:45.500 align:middle line:84%
It gets colder as
it goes down, and is

00:20:45.500 --> 00:20:47.280 align:middle line:90%
discharged at the other end.

00:20:47.280 --> 00:20:51.880 align:middle line:84%
And as it says here, the
differences has been--

00:20:51.880 --> 00:20:55.910 align:middle line:84%
the hot temperature can reach
392 degrees Fahrenheit coming

00:20:55.910 --> 00:20:56.710 align:middle line:90%
out.

00:20:56.710 --> 00:20:59.800 align:middle line:90%
This can reach minus 50 degrees.

00:20:59.800 --> 00:21:02.770 align:middle line:90%
So that's over 400 degrees.

00:21:02.770 --> 00:21:05.410 align:middle line:84%
Now, this is just room
temperature being fed in.

00:21:05.410 --> 00:21:10.030 align:middle line:10%
And it's separated by
almost 400 degrees.

00:21:10.030 --> 00:21:13.520 align:middle line:10%
Here's another depiction of it.

00:21:13.520 --> 00:21:17.630 align:middle line:10%
You can look this
up online, study it.

00:21:17.630 --> 00:21:19.918 align:middle line:84%
The principle of a
thunderstorm is in action here.

00:21:19.918 --> 00:21:21.710 align:middle line:84%
Because what happens
during a thunderstorm?

00:21:21.710 --> 00:21:24.950 align:middle line:84%
You have a cold air mass,
a hot air mass, they meet,

00:21:24.950 --> 00:21:28.350 align:middle line:84%
that generates lightning,
which is plasma.

00:21:28.350 --> 00:21:31.700 align:middle line:84%
So this is a system
now that's been adapted

00:21:31.700 --> 00:21:34.800 align:middle line:90%
in order to generate plasmas.

00:21:34.800 --> 00:21:38.670 align:middle line:10%
And it turns out that there is a
certain geometrical arrangement

00:21:38.670 --> 00:21:41.580 align:middle line:10%
of materials that
can duplicate what's

00:21:41.580 --> 00:21:45.600 align:middle line:10%
going on in that vortex tube,
but with plasmas instead

00:21:45.600 --> 00:21:46.980 align:middle line:10%
of normal air.

00:21:46.980 --> 00:21:49.940 align:middle line:84%
This thing has been called
a thunderstorm generator.

00:21:49.940 --> 00:21:53.720 align:middle line:84%
It's been tested now in
about six laboratories.

00:21:53.720 --> 00:21:58.290 align:middle line:84%
It is actually being implemented
on a substation now outside

00:21:58.290 --> 00:22:00.540 align:middle line:90%
of London.

00:22:00.540 --> 00:22:02.250 align:middle line:84%
This shows what's
happening there

00:22:02.250 --> 00:22:04.830 align:middle line:84%
with the introduction
of the plasmas that

00:22:04.830 --> 00:22:08.310 align:middle line:84%
set up an extremely
rapid whirling

00:22:08.310 --> 00:22:11.200 align:middle line:90%
vortex of plasma energy.

00:22:11.200 --> 00:22:14.860 align:middle line:10%
And here is a thing called
a thunderstorm generator.

00:22:14.860 --> 00:22:18.900 align:middle line:10%
It's being constructed
in a laboratory here.

00:22:18.900 --> 00:22:20.320 align:middle line:10%
It's now being implemented.

00:22:20.320 --> 00:22:26.040 align:middle line:10%
It's being installed on a 300
kilowatt Perkins generator

00:22:26.040 --> 00:22:28.480 align:middle line:10%
on a substation
outside of London.

00:22:28.480 --> 00:22:30.400 align:middle line:10%
It feeds into the
London power grid.

00:22:30.400 --> 00:22:34.490 align:middle line:10%
And this is now contributing
to the distribution of power

00:22:34.490 --> 00:22:35.290 align:middle line:10%
in London.

00:22:35.290 --> 00:22:36.130 align:middle line:10%
This is real.

00:22:36.130 --> 00:22:38.970 align:middle line:10%
It is not some
eccentric tinkerer

00:22:38.970 --> 00:22:41.060 align:middle line:10%
in the garage making
grandiose claims.

00:22:41.060 --> 00:22:41.860 align:middle line:10%
This is real.

00:22:41.860 --> 00:22:43.750 align:middle line:10%
It has now been
tested in Zurich.

00:22:43.750 --> 00:22:46.080 align:middle line:10%
It's been tested in a
major industrial laboratory

00:22:46.080 --> 00:22:47.380 align:middle line:10%
in North Carolina.

00:22:47.380 --> 00:22:50.790 align:middle line:10%
It's been tested at the Tesla
tech conference in New Mexico.

00:22:50.790 --> 00:22:56.480 align:middle line:10%
And it's been tested in London,
and is now being implemented.

00:22:56.480 --> 00:22:58.490 align:middle line:84%
The interesting
thing about this,

00:22:58.490 --> 00:23:02.330 align:middle line:84%
if we had time to get into
it, I would love to show you.

00:23:02.330 --> 00:23:04.280 align:middle line:84%
And I'm going to be
presenting more and more

00:23:04.280 --> 00:23:06.230 align:middle line:90%
about this technology.

00:23:06.230 --> 00:23:08.520 align:middle line:84%
Here's the most
interesting thing about it.

00:23:08.520 --> 00:23:10.200 align:middle line:90%
This is not a new discovery.

00:23:10.200 --> 00:23:11.640 align:middle line:90%
It's a rediscovery.

00:23:11.640 --> 00:23:13.610 align:middle line:10%
And I can make a
very strong case

00:23:13.610 --> 00:23:18.410 align:middle line:10%
that the ancient peoples knew
about how to use geometry

00:23:18.410 --> 00:23:20.983 align:middle line:10%
to control the flow of plasmas.

00:23:20.983 --> 00:23:22.650 align:middle line:10%
And here's the last
thing we'll look at.

00:23:22.650 --> 00:23:25.910 align:middle line:10%
This particular,
this was at a testing

00:23:25.910 --> 00:23:28.310 align:middle line:10%
I was present at and was
able to witness myself

00:23:28.310 --> 00:23:31.220 align:middle line:10%
with high-tier
scientists, engineers,

00:23:31.220 --> 00:23:33.380 align:middle line:10%
and industrial professionals
using equipment

00:23:33.380 --> 00:23:37.380 align:middle line:10%
like gas analyzers and
mass spectrometers.

00:23:37.380 --> 00:23:39.560 align:middle line:10%
We had two generators set up.

00:23:39.560 --> 00:23:42.920 align:middle line:10%
One was the control
generator, the other

00:23:42.920 --> 00:23:45.440 align:middle line:10%
was the one that had
the technology attached

00:23:45.440 --> 00:23:46.890 align:middle line:10%
to it implemented.

00:23:46.890 --> 00:23:49.550 align:middle line:10%
Both of them were turned
on, calibrated to have

00:23:49.550 --> 00:23:51.570 align:middle line:10%
precisely the same emissions.

00:23:51.570 --> 00:23:54.050 align:middle line:10%
So what you see when
you look at the red here

00:23:54.050 --> 00:23:57.490 align:middle line:10%
is that you see right here
is your carbon dioxide.

00:23:57.490 --> 00:24:03.480 align:middle line:10%
It was emitting 9.3% carbon
dioxide, 5.48% carbon monoxide,

00:24:03.480 --> 00:24:09.900 align:middle line:10%
4.66% oxygen, 199 parts per
million of other hydrocarbons,

00:24:09.900 --> 00:24:13.006 align:middle line:10%
and 27 parts per million
of nitrogen oxides.

00:24:13.006 --> 00:24:15.970 align:middle line:84%
OK, so now this generator
is sitting there.

00:24:15.970 --> 00:24:17.320 align:middle line:90%
It's run, it's warmed up.

00:24:17.320 --> 00:24:18.490 align:middle line:90%
This is what it's emitting.

00:24:18.490 --> 00:24:21.660 align:middle line:10%
Now the technology is turned
on, and within two minutes,

00:24:21.660 --> 00:24:25.050 align:middle line:10%
carbon dioxide has gone
to zero, carbon monoxide

00:24:25.050 --> 00:24:27.600 align:middle line:10%
has gone to zero,
hydrocarbons have

00:24:27.600 --> 00:24:31.230 align:middle line:10%
gone from 199 to 58
parts per million,

00:24:31.230 --> 00:24:34.260 align:middle line:10%
nitrogen oxide
from 27 to 4 parts.

00:24:34.260 --> 00:24:38.460 align:middle line:10%
Most interestingly, oxygen
has gone up from 20 point up

00:24:38.460 --> 00:24:42.940 align:middle line:10%
to 20.97%, which happens to be--

00:24:42.940 --> 00:24:45.630 align:middle line:10%
And so what's
happening here is what

00:24:45.630 --> 00:24:47.940 align:middle line:10%
was coming out of
the exhaust has now

00:24:47.940 --> 00:24:54.000 align:middle line:10%
been replaced by pure air
with the most optimum 20.9%

00:24:54.000 --> 00:24:56.340 align:middle line:10%
concentration of
oxygen that you would

00:24:56.340 --> 00:24:58.770 align:middle line:10%
find if you were
breathing in mountain

00:24:58.770 --> 00:25:02.500 align:middle line:10%
air in a pristine environment
with no pollution.

00:25:02.500 --> 00:25:05.520 align:middle line:84%
What's coming out of
there is pure air.

00:25:05.520 --> 00:25:10.370 align:middle line:90%


00:25:10.370 --> 00:25:14.200 align:middle line:84%
So I want you guys to take what
I've been able to present here.

00:25:14.200 --> 00:25:17.390 align:middle line:10%
I'll be having many links that
you can start doing the research

00:25:17.390 --> 00:25:20.030 align:middle line:10%
and learn about
this because we're

00:25:20.030 --> 00:25:22.970 align:middle line:10%
taking the past, the
present, and the future,

00:25:22.970 --> 00:25:24.600 align:middle line:10%
and we're bringing
them together.

00:25:24.600 --> 00:25:28.490 align:middle line:10%
And I think we've created the
potential for a completely--

00:25:28.490 --> 00:25:31.910 align:middle line:10%
for a future that we
can barely even begin

00:25:31.910 --> 00:25:34.040 align:middle line:10%
to visualize the potential of.

00:25:34.040 --> 00:25:37.610 align:middle line:10%
But we are at a crossroads.

00:25:37.610 --> 00:25:39.410 align:middle line:90%
[APPLAUSE]

00:25:39.410 --> 00:25:41.510 align:middle line:90%
Thanks.
