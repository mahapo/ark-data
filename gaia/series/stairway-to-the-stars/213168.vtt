00:00:04.401 --> 00:00:07.824 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:07.824 --> 00:00:11.247 align:middle line:90%


00:00:11.247 --> 00:00:15.340 align:middle line:10%
>> So my topic for
this evening is,

00:00:15.340 --> 00:00:18.850 align:middle line:10%
I call this UAP among
a world in revolution.

00:00:18.850 --> 00:00:22.570 align:middle line:90%


00:00:22.570 --> 00:00:25.870 align:middle line:90%
And so it's a dual theme.

00:00:25.870 --> 00:00:28.870 align:middle line:84%
This is a dual theme that
has been important to me

00:00:28.870 --> 00:00:31.150 align:middle line:90%
for a number of years.

00:00:31.150 --> 00:00:35.680 align:middle line:10%
It's been obvious to
me, even before we

00:00:35.680 --> 00:00:39.190 align:middle line:10%
were invaded by ChatGPT
over the last year,

00:00:39.190 --> 00:00:45.530 align:middle line:10%
and how AI has obviously just
invested itself in our world.

00:00:45.530 --> 00:00:49.240 align:middle line:10%
I just saw a headline, I think,
two or three days ago, something

00:00:49.240 --> 00:00:52.600 align:middle line:10%
like, more than 50%
of Americans are now

00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:55.138 align:middle line:10%
afraid that AI is going
to take their jobs.

00:00:55.138 --> 00:00:56.930 align:middle line:10%
So I don't know if
that's a true statistic,

00:00:56.930 --> 00:00:58.430 align:middle line:10%
but I could believe it.

00:00:58.430 --> 00:00:59.780 align:middle line:10%
I could believe it.

00:00:59.780 --> 00:01:01.200 align:middle line:10%
So there's that whole thing.

00:01:01.200 --> 00:01:04.280 align:middle line:10%
We're in a world in
absolute revolution,

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:08.210 align:middle line:10%
and I'm going to be talking
a lot about that revolution.

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:11.990 align:middle line:10%
But at the same time, there's
this other incredible thing

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:14.360 align:middle line:10%
that's going on,
that we're getting

00:01:14.360 --> 00:01:19.040 align:middle line:10%
a little bit of attention now in
our society about UFOs or UAP,

00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:22.520 align:middle line:10%
but not nearly enough, and
not the right, in my view,

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:25.280 align:middle line:10%
the right kind of
discussion is happening.

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:30.330 align:middle line:84%
And I will give my take on why
I think it should be changing.

00:01:30.330 --> 00:01:31.430 align:middle line:90%
There's two themes.

00:01:31.430 --> 00:01:35.990 align:middle line:10%
And it's not by accident
that we're dealing with them

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:37.360 align:middle line:10%
both at the same time today.

00:01:37.360 --> 00:01:38.160 align:middle line:10%
That's my view.

00:01:38.160 --> 00:01:41.180 align:middle line:10%
I think there's a
reason that there

00:01:41.180 --> 00:01:45.230 align:middle line:10%
is a confluence of these two
massively important things

00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:46.440 align:middle line:10%
happening in our world.

00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:48.440 align:middle line:10%
So let me get started here.

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:52.910 align:middle line:10%
So we are living in a
world in revolution.

00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:58.170 align:middle line:84%
I've said this to a few people,
and I think people get it.

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:01.770 align:middle line:84%
But I think sometimes
we don't get it.

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:04.355 align:middle line:90%
It's not just all of this stuff.

00:02:04.355 --> 00:02:05.730 align:middle line:84%
The digital
revolution-- and I've

00:02:05.730 --> 00:02:07.022 align:middle line:90%
got some bullet points up here.

00:02:07.022 --> 00:02:09.840 align:middle line:84%
And it begins-- only
begins to cover.

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:12.450 align:middle line:84%
The digital revolution, we've
been dealing with for 30 years,

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:14.970 align:middle line:84%
basically, maybe
a little longer.

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:16.210 align:middle line:90%
The world of the internet.

00:02:16.210 --> 00:02:18.330 align:middle line:10%
I mean, it's still
easy for us to forget,

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:20.260 align:middle line:10%
because it's been here
for a few decades,

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:25.170 align:middle line:10%
just how unbelievably it has
turned our world upside down

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:26.730 align:middle line:10%
from the before times.

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:30.100 align:middle line:84%
Some of us remember, and
it's been kind of incredible.

00:02:30.100 --> 00:02:33.510 align:middle line:84%
Now, then we have artificial
intelligence, which finally

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:35.200 align:middle line:90%
we're all starting to see.

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:38.700 align:middle line:84%
I say finally, because I've
been talking about the AI

00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:41.290 align:middle line:90%
revolution for almost 20 years.

00:02:41.290 --> 00:02:42.580 align:middle line:90%
It's been important for me.

00:02:42.580 --> 00:02:43.670 align:middle line:90%
I saw it coming.

00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:44.470 align:middle line:10%
I did.

00:02:44.470 --> 00:02:49.050 align:middle line:84%
And we're now seeing it
begin to transform our world.

00:02:49.050 --> 00:02:50.910 align:middle line:84%
Quantum computing,
that's not something

00:02:50.910 --> 00:02:52.980 align:middle line:84%
that we see in our
world every day.

00:02:52.980 --> 00:02:56.370 align:middle line:84%
But behind the scenes, it's
going to become massively

00:02:56.370 --> 00:02:58.580 align:middle line:90%
important, indeed.

00:02:58.580 --> 00:03:01.250 align:middle line:10%
Essentially, turn current
computing upside down

00:03:01.250 --> 00:03:02.490 align:middle line:10%
in a lot of ways.

00:03:02.490 --> 00:03:05.090 align:middle line:84%
Then there's genetic
manipulation, CRISPR,

00:03:05.090 --> 00:03:08.090 align:middle line:84%
gene-editing technology,
basically moving us

00:03:08.090 --> 00:03:10.680 align:middle line:90%
toward a transhumanist future.

00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:12.200 align:middle line:90%
What is that going to look like?

00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:15.230 align:middle line:84%
Along with all of
these other revolutions

00:03:15.230 --> 00:03:17.540 align:middle line:84%
that are happening
at the same time?

00:03:17.540 --> 00:03:20.030 align:middle line:10%
Nanotech, same thing.

00:03:20.030 --> 00:03:24.980 align:middle line:10%
It's microscopic manipulation
of down to the level

00:03:24.980 --> 00:03:31.490 align:middle line:10%
of the molecule or even atom to
create things like metamaterials

00:03:31.490 --> 00:03:34.580 align:middle line:10%
that essentially would
be considered magical

00:03:34.580 --> 00:03:35.930 align:middle line:10%
in any other time.

00:03:35.930 --> 00:03:38.790 align:middle line:10%
Global communication is
just a general revolution.

00:03:38.790 --> 00:03:41.990 align:middle line:10%
The fact that you can Skype
someone in another country

00:03:41.990 --> 00:03:46.400 align:middle line:10%
instantly, video calls, and
other kinds of communications

00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:47.420 align:middle line:10%
instantaneously.

00:03:47.420 --> 00:03:50.703 align:middle line:84%
We take it for granted, but
it has changed our society

00:03:50.703 --> 00:03:53.120 align:middle line:84%
and it has also changing human
psychology in a lot of ways

00:03:53.120 --> 00:03:54.320 align:middle line:90%
as well.

00:03:54.320 --> 00:03:56.740 align:middle line:84%
Consciousness revolution,
and that's a surprise.

00:03:56.740 --> 00:03:57.630 align:middle line:84%
People who know
me, they're like,

00:03:57.630 --> 00:03:59.255 align:middle line:84%
Dolan doesn't talk
about consciousness.

00:03:59.255 --> 00:04:01.890 align:middle line:10%
But actually, Dolan is
interested in consciousness,

00:04:01.890 --> 00:04:03.610 align:middle line:10%
and I do want to
talk about that.

00:04:03.610 --> 00:04:06.390 align:middle line:10%
We're having a revolution
in a lot of ways

00:04:06.390 --> 00:04:08.700 align:middle line:10%
relating to consciousness.

00:04:08.700 --> 00:04:11.310 align:middle line:10%
Certainly, let's just
say scientifically,

00:04:11.310 --> 00:04:14.790 align:middle line:10%
you've got brain
experts, neurologists,

00:04:14.790 --> 00:04:18.240 align:middle line:10%
experts who are really having
some interesting conversations

00:04:18.240 --> 00:04:20.589 align:middle line:10%
about how the human
mind actually operates.

00:04:20.589 --> 00:04:21.760 align:middle line:10%
What is the human mind?

00:04:21.760 --> 00:04:24.750 align:middle line:10%
Is it all located inside
that brain of yours,

00:04:24.750 --> 00:04:26.710 align:middle line:10%
or are there other
things going on?

00:04:26.710 --> 00:04:27.730 align:middle line:10%
That's interesting.

00:04:27.730 --> 00:04:32.010 align:middle line:10%
And then, of course, the
crowd here, the audience here,

00:04:32.010 --> 00:04:34.170 align:middle line:10%
and the people who
are speaking here

00:04:34.170 --> 00:04:38.010 align:middle line:10%
are also interested in
consciousness as a revolution

00:04:38.010 --> 00:04:41.230 align:middle line:10%
as well, and what are
the potentials there?

00:04:41.230 --> 00:04:44.070 align:middle line:10%
All of this is new for us.

00:04:44.070 --> 00:04:47.100 align:middle line:10%
And then political revolution.

00:04:47.100 --> 00:04:49.530 align:middle line:10%
I have that dumped right in
the middle, which is weird

00:04:49.530 --> 00:04:52.560 align:middle line:10%
because I've been a political
maniac my whole life,

00:04:52.560 --> 00:04:58.080 align:middle line:10%
and I've studied geopolitics
longer than I've studied UFOs.

00:04:58.080 --> 00:05:03.200 align:middle line:10%
And I see a revolution
happening around the world.

00:05:03.200 --> 00:05:05.390 align:middle line:10%
I don't know if it's
a good revolution.

00:05:05.390 --> 00:05:08.090 align:middle line:10%
We tend to think of revolutions
as the French Revolution,

00:05:08.090 --> 00:05:11.280 align:middle line:10%
the American Revolution, the
people making a revolution.

00:05:11.280 --> 00:05:13.980 align:middle line:10%
But not all revolutions
are by the people.

00:05:13.980 --> 00:05:16.550 align:middle line:10%
Some revolutions are
directed from above.

00:05:16.550 --> 00:05:18.090 align:middle line:10%
Revolution from above.

00:05:18.090 --> 00:05:20.240 align:middle line:10%
Hitler did that,
Stalin did that.

00:05:20.240 --> 00:05:25.018 align:middle line:10%
Other powerful national leaders
created a revolution from above.

00:05:25.018 --> 00:05:27.560 align:middle line:84%
They decide, because they think
they're smarter than everyone

00:05:27.560 --> 00:05:30.410 align:middle line:84%
else, that they're going
to remake society according

00:05:30.410 --> 00:05:32.450 align:middle line:90%
to their utopian vision.

00:05:32.450 --> 00:05:34.640 align:middle line:10%
And make no mistake,
those totalitarian visions

00:05:34.640 --> 00:05:37.100 align:middle line:10%
were all utopian,
every one of them.

00:05:37.100 --> 00:05:40.040 align:middle line:10%
It was the idea of
someone who said,

00:05:40.040 --> 00:05:43.110 align:middle line:10%
Humanity needs to be improved.

00:05:43.110 --> 00:05:45.720 align:middle line:10%
I'm going to do it, and we're
going to make it happen.

00:05:45.720 --> 00:05:47.280 align:middle line:10%
Revolution from above.

00:05:47.280 --> 00:05:49.490 align:middle line:10%
Sometimes, it's
just as simple as, I

00:05:49.490 --> 00:05:51.107 align:middle line:10%
want to have all
the power to myself,

00:05:51.107 --> 00:05:52.940 align:middle line:10%
and I'm going to remake
everything so that I

00:05:52.940 --> 00:05:54.210 align:middle line:10%
can live like an emperor.

00:05:54.210 --> 00:05:58.550 align:middle line:10%
But there's often an ideology
there, and there is one today.

00:05:58.550 --> 00:06:02.990 align:middle line:10%
We are experiencing a global
revolution from above right now.

00:06:02.990 --> 00:06:06.170 align:middle line:84%
And we need to understand
why it's happening

00:06:06.170 --> 00:06:07.380 align:middle line:90%
and how it's happening.

00:06:07.380 --> 00:06:10.050 align:middle line:10%
And I will be
talking about that.

00:06:10.050 --> 00:06:11.770 align:middle line:90%
An energy revolution.

00:06:11.770 --> 00:06:14.010 align:middle line:84%
I almost didn't include
this, but the fact

00:06:14.010 --> 00:06:16.770 align:middle line:84%
is we are in the
midst of, at least,

00:06:16.770 --> 00:06:22.830 align:middle line:84%
you are seeing a global attempt
to reorient how human beings

00:06:22.830 --> 00:06:24.830 align:middle line:90%
acquire and use energy.

00:06:24.830 --> 00:06:26.440 align:middle line:90%
We will see how far it goes.

00:06:26.440 --> 00:06:30.120 align:middle line:10%
We're still in fossil
fuels pretty much big time.

00:06:30.120 --> 00:06:32.100 align:middle line:10%
But there are
other possibilities

00:06:32.100 --> 00:06:35.070 align:middle line:10%
that await, including things
that are relevant for the UFO

00:06:35.070 --> 00:06:36.640 align:middle line:10%
or UAP subject.

00:06:36.640 --> 00:06:39.840 align:middle line:10%
Because after all,
as I have often said,

00:06:39.840 --> 00:06:42.690 align:middle line:10%
whatever those objects use
to go from here to there,

00:06:42.690 --> 00:06:44.980 align:middle line:10%
it's not high octane gasoline.

00:06:44.980 --> 00:06:46.560 align:middle line:10%
It's something a
little bit better.

00:06:46.560 --> 00:06:50.160 align:middle line:10%
There's obviously a
solution in terms of energy

00:06:50.160 --> 00:06:52.630 align:middle line:10%
to explain whatever
it is they do.

00:06:52.630 --> 00:06:55.230 align:middle line:84%
And it's, I would
say, in our interest

00:06:55.230 --> 00:06:56.790 align:middle line:90%
to find out what that is.

00:06:56.790 --> 00:06:58.270 align:middle line:90%
So that's a revolution.

00:06:58.270 --> 00:07:01.570 align:middle line:10%
And then disclosure, I
didn't call a revolution.

00:07:01.570 --> 00:07:03.160 align:middle line:90%
I called it an insurgency.

00:07:03.160 --> 00:07:05.820 align:middle line:84%
We're having a
disclosure insurgency.

00:07:05.820 --> 00:07:09.590 align:middle line:84%
And not all, by the way,
only about UFOs or UAP.

00:07:09.590 --> 00:07:12.770 align:middle line:84%
That's one, and we're going
to be talking about that.

00:07:12.770 --> 00:07:14.770 align:middle line:84%
But actually, I
would say that there

00:07:14.770 --> 00:07:16.870 align:middle line:84%
is a growing
movement among people

00:07:16.870 --> 00:07:19.570 align:middle line:84%
around the world for all
kinds of transparency,

00:07:19.570 --> 00:07:22.550 align:middle line:84%
all kinds of disclosures
on different subjects.

00:07:22.550 --> 00:07:26.290 align:middle line:84%
But certainly, in the area
that I'll be talking about,

00:07:26.290 --> 00:07:28.220 align:middle line:90%
there is an insurgency going on.

00:07:28.220 --> 00:07:30.830 align:middle line:10%
And we're going to talk
about that as well.

00:07:30.830 --> 00:07:32.290 align:middle line:90%
So those are some.

00:07:32.290 --> 00:07:34.245 align:middle line:84%
That gets scratching
the surface.

00:07:34.245 --> 00:07:36.900 align:middle line:90%


00:07:36.900 --> 00:07:38.970 align:middle line:10%
That revolutionary stuff
that I'm talking about

00:07:38.970 --> 00:07:45.690 align:middle line:10%
is going on with the
backdrop of these objects.

00:07:45.690 --> 00:07:49.380 align:middle line:10%
And they are objects,
many of them.

00:07:49.380 --> 00:07:53.220 align:middle line:10%
The thing-- we hear UAP now
all the time, which is--

00:07:53.220 --> 00:07:55.680 align:middle line:10%
that acronym has gone through
some changes, by the way.

00:07:55.680 --> 00:08:00.510 align:middle line:10%
But now, it stands for, I think,
unknown aerial phenomena--

00:08:00.510 --> 00:08:04.255 align:middle line:10%
or no, unknown anomalous
phenomena, excuse me.

00:08:04.255 --> 00:08:05.380 align:middle line:10%
It's, kind of, a good word.

00:08:05.380 --> 00:08:08.310 align:middle line:10%
I mean, I resisted it for
a while, I will admit that.

00:08:08.310 --> 00:08:10.650 align:middle line:10%
I didn't like the fact that
it seemed a little more

00:08:10.650 --> 00:08:12.520 align:middle line:10%
vague, a little more nebulous.

00:08:12.520 --> 00:08:18.720 align:middle line:10%
I didn't like the fact that
it made the notion of UFO

00:08:18.720 --> 00:08:20.530 align:middle line:10%
less distinct.

00:08:20.530 --> 00:08:23.670 align:middle line:10%
And also, I was concerned, when
we started hearing the phrase

00:08:23.670 --> 00:08:29.190 align:middle line:10%
"UAP," that the whole subject
was being rebranded in a way

00:08:29.190 --> 00:08:30.630 align:middle line:10%
that I didn't--

00:08:30.630 --> 00:08:32.429 align:middle line:10%
like I understood in a way.

00:08:32.429 --> 00:08:33.940 align:middle line:10%
I do understand.

00:08:33.940 --> 00:08:36.330 align:middle line:84%
But part of me was
thinking, I don't really

00:08:36.330 --> 00:08:39.360 align:middle line:84%
know if I like this because
I see the history getting

00:08:39.360 --> 00:08:40.679 align:middle line:90%
siphoned out of this subject.

00:08:40.679 --> 00:08:42.929 align:middle line:84%
It's like this whole thing
started, what, with the tic

00:08:42.929 --> 00:08:44.470 align:middle line:90%
tac in 2004.

00:08:44.470 --> 00:08:49.800 align:middle line:10%
And I'm thinking, there was a
whole 20th century of this that

00:08:49.800 --> 00:08:53.400 align:middle line:10%
included a cover-up, by the way,
that I thought we need to be

00:08:53.400 --> 00:08:54.400 align:middle line:10%
talking about.

00:08:54.400 --> 00:08:57.480 align:middle line:84%
And my fear is-- and
it remains, actually--

00:08:57.480 --> 00:08:59.320 align:middle line:90%
is that that's being taken away.

00:08:59.320 --> 00:09:01.180 align:middle line:10%
We should not forget UFO.

00:09:01.180 --> 00:09:03.270 align:middle line:10%
I frankly really feel
that way because there

00:09:03.270 --> 00:09:06.780 align:middle line:10%
are times when we're really
talking about objects, craft.

00:09:06.780 --> 00:09:09.990 align:middle line:10%
And I don't
personally like to see

00:09:09.990 --> 00:09:12.660 align:middle line:10%
that get lost in the shuffle.

00:09:12.660 --> 00:09:16.980 align:middle line:10%
But anyway, the greater point
here is simply that these

00:09:16.980 --> 00:09:20.790 align:middle line:10%
revolutionary things happening
in our world are occurring

00:09:20.790 --> 00:09:25.890 align:middle line:10%
against a backdrop of
incredibly intense and active,

00:09:25.890 --> 00:09:31.150 align:middle line:10%
and daily sightings of
UFOs, and sometimes UAP,

00:09:31.150 --> 00:09:33.820 align:middle line:10%
around the world every
single day, every single day,

00:09:33.820 --> 00:09:36.340 align:middle line:10%
including scenes like
I have depicted here,

00:09:36.340 --> 00:09:43.000 align:middle line:10%
that is 2:00 AM sighting of
a flying saucer or a triangle

00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:46.240 align:middle line:10%
sometimes hovering over your
home or your neighbor's home

00:09:46.240 --> 00:09:47.890 align:middle line:10%
in the dead of night.

00:09:47.890 --> 00:09:51.730 align:middle line:10%
And I know this because I've
been fanatically reading

00:09:51.730 --> 00:09:55.030 align:middle line:10%
thousands and thousands
more UFO reports

00:09:55.030 --> 00:09:57.340 align:middle line:10%
over the last couple of years.

00:09:57.340 --> 00:09:59.200 align:middle line:84%
There are a number
of patterns that you

00:09:59.200 --> 00:10:01.780 align:middle line:90%
see emerge in these sightings.

00:10:01.780 --> 00:10:04.372 align:middle line:84%
One of the patterns
is this 2:00 AM thing.

00:10:04.372 --> 00:10:06.830 align:middle line:84%
Someone will write in, they'll
say, well, I couldn't sleep.

00:10:06.830 --> 00:10:11.620 align:middle line:84%
I went outside, and
I almost didn't see.

00:10:11.620 --> 00:10:12.970 align:middle line:90%
I almost missed it.

00:10:12.970 --> 00:10:14.090 align:middle line:90%
They'll often say this.

00:10:14.090 --> 00:10:17.080 align:middle line:84%
These things are stealthy
in the extreme frequently.

00:10:17.080 --> 00:10:19.400 align:middle line:84%
They're very quiet,
often easy to miss.

00:10:19.400 --> 00:10:21.040 align:middle line:90%
But there they are.

00:10:21.040 --> 00:10:23.890 align:middle line:84%
And what are they doing
over your neighbor's house

00:10:23.890 --> 00:10:27.200 align:middle line:84%
or your house, by the way, at
2:00 in the morning or 3:00

00:10:27.200 --> 00:10:28.420 align:middle line:90%
in the morning?

00:10:28.420 --> 00:10:32.840 align:middle line:84%
There's a significant subset of
sightings that are exactly that.

00:10:32.840 --> 00:10:35.590 align:middle line:84%
There's another-- there's
a bunch of subsets.

00:10:35.590 --> 00:10:38.480 align:middle line:84%
What we want to look for in
these things are patterns,

00:10:38.480 --> 00:10:40.520 align:middle line:84%
and that's one
thing I try to do.

00:10:40.520 --> 00:10:44.050 align:middle line:84%
But anyway, my point
is all of us going on,

00:10:44.050 --> 00:10:48.280 align:middle line:84%
and we have thousands of
these sightings every year.

00:10:48.280 --> 00:10:53.130 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to get into that
more specifically shortly.

00:10:53.130 --> 00:11:00.470 align:middle line:84%
And all of this is happening
with basically no understanding,

00:11:00.470 --> 00:11:03.680 align:middle line:84%
no recognition that
it's happening.

00:11:03.680 --> 00:11:05.360 align:middle line:10%
I mean, you really
think about it.

00:11:05.360 --> 00:11:08.720 align:middle line:10%
Those of us who are interested
in this subject of UFOs,

00:11:08.720 --> 00:11:11.420 align:middle line:10%
after a while, you learn
to take it for granted.

00:11:11.420 --> 00:11:13.157 align:middle line:84%
At first, it always
is kind of crazy.

00:11:13.157 --> 00:11:14.490 align:middle line:90%
It's like, my god, this is real.

00:11:14.490 --> 00:11:20.090 align:middle line:10%
But then after, six months, or
six years, or 30 years for me

00:11:20.090 --> 00:11:23.450 align:middle line:10%
and some of you for longer,
then you're used to it.

00:11:23.450 --> 00:11:28.460 align:middle line:10%
But the fact is,
it's a crazy thing.

00:11:28.460 --> 00:11:30.770 align:middle line:10%
It blankets the world.

00:11:30.770 --> 00:11:33.590 align:middle line:84%
And we don't really
talk about it.

00:11:33.590 --> 00:11:34.950 align:middle line:90%
We don't get into that.

00:11:34.950 --> 00:11:37.130 align:middle line:90%
So there's that.

00:11:37.130 --> 00:11:41.260 align:middle line:10%
And then the fact that
all of the transformation

00:11:41.260 --> 00:11:43.460 align:middle line:10%
of the human species that
is going on right now,

00:11:43.460 --> 00:11:45.650 align:middle line:10%
that is not even now.

00:11:45.650 --> 00:11:48.490 align:middle line:10%
It's really not fully
appreciated, in my opinion.

00:11:48.490 --> 00:11:50.860 align:middle line:10%
Now, it's true, people
throughout history

00:11:50.860 --> 00:11:51.950 align:middle line:10%
has been the rule.

00:11:51.950 --> 00:11:53.867 align:middle line:10%
There's always been a
lot of change happening.

00:11:53.867 --> 00:11:59.470 align:middle line:10%
And usually, people don't truly
appreciate the depth and power

00:11:59.470 --> 00:12:03.130 align:middle line:10%
of those changes until
maybe generations later.

00:12:03.130 --> 00:12:05.240 align:middle line:10%
But this is what
we've got going on.

00:12:05.240 --> 00:12:08.560 align:middle line:10%
It really is big,
and we really need

00:12:08.560 --> 00:12:11.920 align:middle line:10%
to get a handle on
what is happening.

00:12:11.920 --> 00:12:16.030 align:middle line:10%
So we've got to do
a little bit better.

00:12:16.030 --> 00:12:18.700 align:middle line:10%
This is a slide I actually
created a couple of years ago,

00:12:18.700 --> 00:12:21.040 align:middle line:10%
but I wanted to bring
this in because it

00:12:21.040 --> 00:12:22.610 align:middle line:10%
covers what I say pretty well.

00:12:22.610 --> 00:12:25.060 align:middle line:10%
It gives a visual
of our transhuman

00:12:25.060 --> 00:12:27.040 align:middle line:10%
era that we're kind
of moving into.

00:12:27.040 --> 00:12:29.830 align:middle line:10%
It's a nice guy, a happy
guy with a bionic arm.

00:12:29.830 --> 00:12:35.960 align:middle line:10%
The top center is a robot or an
AI robot built a couple of years

00:12:35.960 --> 00:12:36.760 align:middle line:10%
ago.

00:12:36.760 --> 00:12:39.700 align:middle line:84%
I think she's in Qatar, if
I'm not mistaken, named Sofia.

00:12:39.700 --> 00:12:41.740 align:middle line:90%
And you can talk to her.

00:12:41.740 --> 00:12:43.570 align:middle line:90%
I'm sure there's better now.

00:12:43.570 --> 00:12:46.750 align:middle line:84%
On the top right is an
artist's representation

00:12:46.750 --> 00:12:50.230 align:middle line:90%
of how humans may look in--

00:12:50.230 --> 00:12:51.910 align:middle line:84%
who knows? a few
centuries, whatever,

00:12:51.910 --> 00:12:54.010 align:middle line:90%
maybe a few thousand years.

00:12:54.010 --> 00:12:56.500 align:middle line:10%
Human evolution does continue.

00:12:56.500 --> 00:12:59.170 align:middle line:10%
All evolution continues
because life simply

00:12:59.170 --> 00:13:01.570 align:middle line:10%
adapts to new surroundings
that it finds itself in,

00:13:01.570 --> 00:13:05.720 align:middle line:10%
and either adapts,
transforms, or disappears.

00:13:05.720 --> 00:13:09.190 align:middle line:10%
And so the idea is that human
eyes are going to get larger.

00:13:09.190 --> 00:13:13.340 align:middle line:10%
The human cranium brain, they
say, is going to get larger.

00:13:13.340 --> 00:13:15.040 align:middle line:10%
Although, I really
feel bad for you

00:13:15.040 --> 00:13:21.000 align:middle line:10%
ladies who are going to have
to deliver babies with heads.

00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:21.800 align:middle line:10%
I'll be serious.

00:13:21.800 --> 00:13:24.143 align:middle line:10%
Like any larger--
there are limits.

00:13:24.143 --> 00:13:27.640 align:middle line:90%


00:13:27.640 --> 00:13:30.860 align:middle line:10%
But what are we hearing
about these days?

00:13:30.860 --> 00:13:34.350 align:middle line:10%
We're hearing about artificial
incubators, artificial children.

00:13:34.350 --> 00:13:36.400 align:middle line:10%
I don't think that's
going to go away.

00:13:36.400 --> 00:13:40.853 align:middle line:10%
I think there will continue to
be a growing movement for this.

00:13:40.853 --> 00:13:42.770 align:middle line:10%
I don't think that's a
good thing, by the way.

00:13:42.770 --> 00:13:44.890 align:middle line:10%
I mean, yes, I haven't
gone through labor,

00:13:44.890 --> 00:13:46.040 align:middle line:10%
I will admit that.

00:13:46.040 --> 00:13:48.340 align:middle line:84%
But I get a little
nervous when I

00:13:48.340 --> 00:13:52.690 align:middle line:84%
see our species moving so
dramatically away from what

00:13:52.690 --> 00:13:54.282 align:middle line:90%
we are biologically.

00:13:54.282 --> 00:13:55.490 align:middle line:90%
It makes me a little nervous.

00:13:55.490 --> 00:13:56.365 align:middle line:90%
I'm not going to lie.

00:13:56.365 --> 00:13:58.550 align:middle line:84%
But anyway, we are
looking at that.

00:13:58.550 --> 00:14:00.940 align:middle line:84%
And in such a
situation, you could

00:14:00.940 --> 00:14:04.690 align:middle line:84%
see human heads
genetically maybe

00:14:04.690 --> 00:14:07.270 align:middle line:84%
being designed a
bit larger, probably

00:14:07.270 --> 00:14:08.710 align:middle line:84%
at the expense of
other body parts

00:14:08.710 --> 00:14:11.800 align:middle line:84%
because the brain is
very expensive in terms

00:14:11.800 --> 00:14:13.510 align:middle line:90%
of your nutrition.

00:14:13.510 --> 00:14:17.120 align:middle line:84%
It's an energy hog, and it's
going to need a lot more.

00:14:17.120 --> 00:14:19.840 align:middle line:84%
So it'll come at the expense
of other things maybe.

00:14:19.840 --> 00:14:22.270 align:middle line:84%
On the bottom,
artist's rendition

00:14:22.270 --> 00:14:24.050 align:middle line:90%
of an alien human hybrid.

00:14:24.050 --> 00:14:26.850 align:middle line:90%
And of course, one of the Greys.

00:14:26.850 --> 00:14:30.450 align:middle line:10%
And you can see, we are--

00:14:30.450 --> 00:14:33.970 align:middle line:10%
are we going through
a transformation here?

00:14:33.970 --> 00:14:35.500 align:middle line:10%
Maybe.

00:14:35.500 --> 00:14:41.650 align:middle line:10%
I consider it not an irony and
not a coincidence necessarily.

00:14:41.650 --> 00:14:43.170 align:middle line:10%
Maybe an irony,
but probably not.

00:14:43.170 --> 00:14:46.350 align:middle line:10%
That we are in now the
process of achieving

00:14:46.350 --> 00:14:48.600 align:middle line:10%
a transhumanist society,
or at least maybe

00:14:48.600 --> 00:14:52.050 align:middle line:10%
the early stages of
that, at the same time.

00:14:52.050 --> 00:14:56.490 align:middle line:10%
That we are seeing large
numbers of non-human

00:14:56.490 --> 00:15:00.390 align:middle line:10%
intelligences making their
appearance in large numbers.

00:15:00.390 --> 00:15:02.160 align:middle line:10%
I'm going to get into
the whole thing of,

00:15:02.160 --> 00:15:04.080 align:middle line:10%
have they been here
forever or not?

00:15:04.080 --> 00:15:05.790 align:middle line:10%
Well, let's put a pin in that.

00:15:05.790 --> 00:15:08.578 align:middle line:10%
Let me move on.

00:15:08.578 --> 00:15:10.620 align:middle line:84%
There's a bunch of questions
we should be asking.

00:15:10.620 --> 00:15:12.620 align:middle line:84%
I have a bunch more
lined up for you later.

00:15:12.620 --> 00:15:14.610 align:middle line:90%
But let's just start with a few.

00:15:14.610 --> 00:15:17.240 align:middle line:84%
What changes should
we be expecting

00:15:17.240 --> 00:15:20.640 align:middle line:84%
in the next decade,
or two decades,

00:15:20.640 --> 00:15:22.797 align:middle line:90%
or maybe 50 years, or more?

00:15:22.797 --> 00:15:24.630 align:middle line:84%
It's an interesting
question to think about.

00:15:24.630 --> 00:15:25.950 align:middle line:90%
I'm sure I'm not the only one.

00:15:25.950 --> 00:15:28.760 align:middle line:84%
I'm sure many of you have
wondered the same thing.

00:15:28.760 --> 00:15:32.210 align:middle line:10%
And here's another question,
what's the attitude of them,

00:15:32.210 --> 00:15:37.110 align:middle line:10%
the non-human intelligences
amidst this transformation?

00:15:37.110 --> 00:15:38.790 align:middle line:10%
Do they have an
attitude about it?

00:15:38.790 --> 00:15:41.580 align:middle line:10%
Well, I can only speculate
and we can only speculate,

00:15:41.580 --> 00:15:42.650 align:middle line:10%
but we're going to.

00:15:42.650 --> 00:15:43.530 align:middle line:10%
I will.

00:15:43.530 --> 00:15:44.720 align:middle line:10%
I'll be sharing it.

00:15:44.720 --> 00:15:47.430 align:middle line:10%
There's a hint of what
we should be expecting.

00:15:47.430 --> 00:15:49.680 align:middle line:10%
Think hive mind.

00:15:49.680 --> 00:15:52.860 align:middle line:10%
And that's something
actually that's

00:15:52.860 --> 00:15:55.890 align:middle line:10%
been sought after,
believe it or not,

00:15:55.890 --> 00:16:00.150 align:middle line:10%
by visionaries, if we can call
them that, for at least 50,

00:16:00.150 --> 00:16:01.950 align:middle line:10%
60 years at a minimum.

00:16:01.950 --> 00:16:07.560 align:middle line:10%
There have been a number think
tank thinkers who are futurists,

00:16:07.560 --> 00:16:09.600 align:middle line:10%
at least as far
back as the 1960s,

00:16:09.600 --> 00:16:15.720 align:middle line:10%
that era of ultimate scientific
utopianism, where take a pill.

00:16:15.720 --> 00:16:18.870 align:middle line:10%
Instead of eat a steak meal,
just have this, have this pill,

00:16:18.870 --> 00:16:22.770 align:middle line:10%
have this, and all of that.

00:16:22.770 --> 00:16:24.150 align:middle line:84%
There were people
who said, we're

00:16:24.150 --> 00:16:26.530 align:middle line:84%
going to need to have a
hive mind in the future.

00:16:26.530 --> 00:16:31.540 align:middle line:84%
All consciousness is going
to be connected in some way.

00:16:31.540 --> 00:16:36.540 align:middle line:84%
Yes, people were arguing
this back in the 1960s.

00:16:36.540 --> 00:16:41.990 align:middle line:84%
And I think that's
a real possibility.

00:16:41.990 --> 00:16:46.280 align:middle line:10%
We're already seeing it
through like social media

00:16:46.280 --> 00:16:50.150 align:middle line:10%
and the immersion
that we have digitally

00:16:50.150 --> 00:16:54.240 align:middle line:10%
with-- kind of consciousness
that's invading you.

00:16:54.240 --> 00:16:56.160 align:middle line:10%
You can't escape it.

00:16:56.160 --> 00:16:57.800 align:middle line:10%
If you have social
media presence,

00:16:57.800 --> 00:17:01.200 align:middle line:10%
you're already experiencing
the beginnings of a hive mind.

00:17:01.200 --> 00:17:04.069 align:middle line:10%
And our society is
already experiencing

00:17:04.069 --> 00:17:08.030 align:middle line:10%
the results of a hive mind
that is just beginning.

00:17:08.030 --> 00:17:12.750 align:middle line:10%
This is one reason why everyone
gets so worked up over politics,

00:17:12.750 --> 00:17:13.550 align:middle line:10%
I'm convinced.

00:17:13.550 --> 00:17:14.915 align:middle line:10%
It's like in your face.

00:17:14.915 --> 00:17:16.040 align:middle line:10%
It's like choo, choo, choo.

00:17:16.040 --> 00:17:18.900 align:middle line:10%
And there's no escape.

00:17:18.900 --> 00:17:19.859 align:middle line:10%
There's no escape.

00:17:19.859 --> 00:17:25.760 align:middle line:10%
And it's transforming us not
always, I think, for the better.

00:17:25.760 --> 00:17:30.660 align:middle line:84%
The transformation is taking
us, what I firmly believe--

00:17:30.660 --> 00:17:32.690 align:middle line:84%
this is my own
little pet theory--

00:17:32.690 --> 00:17:34.430 align:middle line:84%
of bringing humanity
into what I have

00:17:34.430 --> 00:17:37.580 align:middle line:84%
been calling the fourth
stage of its existence.

00:17:37.580 --> 00:17:39.265 align:middle line:90%
The fourth stage.

00:17:39.265 --> 00:17:40.640 align:middle line:84%
Now, you're
thinking, well, we've

00:17:40.640 --> 00:17:42.960 align:middle line:84%
been around for a long
time and only four stages?

00:17:42.960 --> 00:17:44.780 align:middle line:90%
Yes, only four stages.

00:17:44.780 --> 00:17:45.860 align:middle line:90%
That's right.

00:17:45.860 --> 00:17:48.130 align:middle line:10%
I'm going to show you the
first three real quickly.

00:17:48.130 --> 00:17:51.990 align:middle line:10%
This is a good
characterization of stage 1.

00:17:51.990 --> 00:17:55.420 align:middle line:84%
It's a stage we lived
in for a long time.

00:17:55.420 --> 00:17:58.870 align:middle line:10%
Over the last five years,
I've really gone deep

00:17:58.870 --> 00:18:00.170 align:middle line:10%
into human prehistory.

00:18:00.170 --> 00:18:03.040 align:middle line:10%
It's become a very
strong interest of mine

00:18:03.040 --> 00:18:07.880 align:middle line:10%
because I started
because I actually--

00:18:07.880 --> 00:18:10.460 align:middle line:10%
I think the ancient
aliens theory is actually

00:18:10.460 --> 00:18:11.550 align:middle line:10%
what started me.

00:18:11.550 --> 00:18:14.640 align:middle line:84%
I thought, I don't like
having holes in my knowledge.

00:18:14.640 --> 00:18:23.150 align:middle line:84%
So is there a place in our
ancient past for alien tinkering

00:18:23.150 --> 00:18:24.050 align:middle line:90%
or who knows what?

00:18:24.050 --> 00:18:25.650 align:middle line:90%
Anything interesting.

00:18:25.650 --> 00:18:28.190 align:middle line:84%
And so I just started reading,
and then I read, and then

00:18:28.190 --> 00:18:29.700 align:middle line:84%
I read, and read some
more, and read some more,

00:18:29.700 --> 00:18:30.720 align:middle line:90%
and I haven't stopped.

00:18:30.720 --> 00:18:32.520 align:middle line:10%
And I'm fascinated.

00:18:32.520 --> 00:18:34.520 align:middle line:10%
I'm utterly,
absolutely captivated

00:18:34.520 --> 00:18:37.040 align:middle line:10%
by the long history
of our species

00:18:37.040 --> 00:18:39.030 align:middle line:10%
and the stages of
our civilization.

00:18:39.030 --> 00:18:43.562 align:middle line:10%
And stage 1, let's just call it
simple hunting and gathering.

00:18:43.562 --> 00:18:44.520 align:middle line:10%
There's a lot going on.

00:18:44.520 --> 00:18:46.350 align:middle line:10%
There's a lot of
different levels to that.

00:18:46.350 --> 00:18:47.780 align:middle line:10%
It's not all the same.

00:18:47.780 --> 00:18:50.710 align:middle line:10%
Homo erectus, 2 million years
ago, they were doing it.

00:18:50.710 --> 00:18:51.775 align:middle line:10%
Did a pretty good job.

00:18:51.775 --> 00:18:54.290 align:middle line:10%
Now, this is an image
of a human society,

00:18:54.290 --> 00:18:58.730 align:middle line:10%
maybe 50,000 years ago or so.

00:18:58.730 --> 00:19:03.320 align:middle line:10%
A little more advanced, but
really the same fundamental form

00:19:03.320 --> 00:19:06.450 align:middle line:10%
of existence, and one that we
really had until we reached

00:19:06.450 --> 00:19:11.550 align:middle line:10%
stage 2, which is development
of agriculture and animal

00:19:11.550 --> 00:19:15.750 align:middle line:10%
husbandry, about
10,000 years ago.

00:19:15.750 --> 00:19:18.472 align:middle line:10%
Happened over stage,
not overnight.

00:19:18.472 --> 00:19:19.430 align:middle line:10%
It took a little while.

00:19:19.430 --> 00:19:23.277 align:middle line:10%
But, well, you never knew
how good the Medieval people

00:19:23.277 --> 00:19:24.860 align:middle line:10%
can clean up until
you see the hunters

00:19:24.860 --> 00:19:26.220 align:middle line:10%
and gatherers before them.

00:19:26.220 --> 00:19:28.100 align:middle line:10%
But he's doing all right there.

00:19:28.100 --> 00:19:30.650 align:middle line:90%
And it's a pretty good life.

00:19:30.650 --> 00:19:35.600 align:middle line:84%
It's nicer houses and control
over all kinds of species,

00:19:35.600 --> 00:19:37.170 align:middle line:90%
both plant and animal.

00:19:37.170 --> 00:19:39.000 align:middle line:90%
And it's a stage too.

00:19:39.000 --> 00:19:42.080 align:middle line:84%
This is like-- this is
everything from ancient Sumer,

00:19:42.080 --> 00:19:45.300 align:middle line:84%
to the Roman Empire, to
the Italian Renaissance.

00:19:45.300 --> 00:19:48.470 align:middle line:90%
And it was a good run.

00:19:48.470 --> 00:19:51.090 align:middle line:10%
It was a great run for humanity.

00:19:51.090 --> 00:19:57.080 align:middle line:10%
Violent, vicious, nasty,
but you could really

00:19:57.080 --> 00:19:58.710 align:middle line:10%
see us getting our groove on.

00:19:58.710 --> 00:20:00.770 align:middle line:10%
But here's the point,
I think that there

00:20:00.770 --> 00:20:04.760 align:middle line:10%
is a fundamental unity, even
from an Egyptian peasant working

00:20:04.760 --> 00:20:08.550 align:middle line:10%
off the Nile to someone
in this much more modern--

00:20:08.550 --> 00:20:10.880 align:middle line:10%
I mean, if you transported
one to the other,

00:20:10.880 --> 00:20:12.240 align:middle line:10%
they'd basically get it.

00:20:12.240 --> 00:20:14.810 align:middle line:10%
Even though there's thousands
of years of distance,

00:20:14.810 --> 00:20:19.980 align:middle line:10%
they would understand the nature
of that society pretty well.

00:20:19.980 --> 00:20:22.540 align:middle line:10%
A couple of adaptations here
and there, but really not all

00:20:22.540 --> 00:20:23.340 align:middle line:10%
that different.

00:20:23.340 --> 00:20:24.798 align:middle line:10%
You're working with
animals, you're

00:20:24.798 --> 00:20:27.790 align:middle line:10%
working hard as manual labor,
you've got to communal settings.

00:20:27.790 --> 00:20:30.070 align:middle line:10%
All of that is very important.

00:20:30.070 --> 00:20:32.770 align:middle line:10%
And then you get to stage 3,
here's a nice representation.

00:20:32.770 --> 00:20:34.140 align:middle line:10%
Talk about cleaning up nice.

00:20:34.140 --> 00:20:37.080 align:middle line:10%
Hey, the 1960s, we
had it going on.

00:20:37.080 --> 00:20:42.550 align:middle line:10%
Stage 3 is the stage of
science and advanced industry.

00:20:42.550 --> 00:20:45.690 align:middle line:10%
So really starting, let's
say, the late 1700s,

00:20:45.690 --> 00:20:47.310 align:middle line:10%
where it really gets going.

00:20:47.310 --> 00:20:50.580 align:middle line:10%
The 19th century, the century
of the American Civil War

00:20:50.580 --> 00:20:54.480 align:middle line:10%
and Napoleon, that's
where humanity really,

00:20:54.480 --> 00:20:58.780 align:middle line:10%
truly began transforming this
world: Railroads, the telegraph.

00:20:58.780 --> 00:21:02.190 align:middle line:10%
There's some instant
communication for you.

00:21:02.190 --> 00:21:06.490 align:middle line:10%
Global shipping and all of the
beginnings of the stock market,

00:21:06.490 --> 00:21:08.770 align:middle line:10%
and that's stage 3.

00:21:08.770 --> 00:21:11.200 align:middle line:10%
It's the world we
were all born into.

00:21:11.200 --> 00:21:13.570 align:middle line:90%
And it's a great world.

00:21:13.570 --> 00:21:15.280 align:middle line:90%
It was a great world.

00:21:15.280 --> 00:21:16.840 align:middle line:10%
It was a great run.

00:21:16.840 --> 00:21:20.960 align:middle line:10%
Much shorter run
than stages 1 or 2.

00:21:20.960 --> 00:21:22.520 align:middle line:10%
They're speeding up.

00:21:22.520 --> 00:21:25.890 align:middle line:10%
And now, we're moving
into, well, I don't know.

00:21:25.890 --> 00:21:27.710 align:middle line:10%
I don't know what
stage 4 is going to be.

00:21:27.710 --> 00:21:30.030 align:middle line:84%
But it's not going to
be the same as stage 3.

00:21:30.030 --> 00:21:31.610 align:middle line:90%
That's a guarantee.

00:21:31.610 --> 00:21:34.070 align:middle line:10%
Something radically different.

00:21:34.070 --> 00:21:37.320 align:middle line:10%
It's not just one little
thing that's changing.

00:21:37.320 --> 00:21:41.040 align:middle line:84%
It's, as I was saying, AI
embedded into our world.

00:21:41.040 --> 00:21:43.670 align:middle line:84%
And we're only at
the beginning of AI.

00:21:43.670 --> 00:21:44.720 align:middle line:90%
We all know.

00:21:44.720 --> 00:21:46.430 align:middle line:10%
How far can it go?

00:21:46.430 --> 00:21:48.125 align:middle line:10%
Whose job is at risk?

00:21:48.125 --> 00:21:50.500 align:middle line:10%
You know, every one of us
speakers here, we wonder this--

00:21:50.500 --> 00:21:52.720 align:middle line:10%
I wonder-- I mean, really, I do.

00:21:52.720 --> 00:21:54.720 align:middle line:10%
One day, you're not going
to need a guy like me.

00:21:54.720 --> 00:21:57.060 align:middle line:10%
You can just ask your AI
for something about UFOs.

00:21:57.060 --> 00:21:59.010 align:middle line:10%
And it may do a
better job than I do.

00:21:59.010 --> 00:22:02.020 align:middle line:10%
I hope-- not yet, not yet.

00:22:02.020 --> 00:22:04.480 align:middle line:90%
But I feel like John Henry.

00:22:04.480 --> 00:22:06.860 align:middle line:84%
Remember John Henry,
the steel-driving man?

00:22:06.860 --> 00:22:10.510 align:middle line:84%
They come up with a way to drive
steel for the railroads that's

00:22:10.510 --> 00:22:11.660 align:middle line:90%
better than a human being.

00:22:11.660 --> 00:22:13.660 align:middle line:90%
John Henry was real strong.

00:22:13.660 --> 00:22:15.830 align:middle line:10%
And he's like, ain't no
machine's going to beat me.

00:22:15.830 --> 00:22:18.440 align:middle line:10%
And so they have a race.

00:22:18.440 --> 00:22:20.260 align:middle line:10%
And he wins.

00:22:20.260 --> 00:22:22.600 align:middle line:10%
But then he dies of a
heart attack, I believe.

00:22:22.600 --> 00:22:25.000 align:middle line:10%
So yeah.

00:22:25.000 --> 00:22:30.010 align:middle line:10%
Anyway, Stage 4 is weird
because we don't know,

00:22:30.010 --> 00:22:34.300 align:middle line:10%
but there will be things like
very likely brain computer

00:22:34.300 --> 00:22:35.300 align:middle line:10%
interfaces.

00:22:35.300 --> 00:22:36.670 align:middle line:10%
So that's one thing.

00:22:36.670 --> 00:22:38.540 align:middle line:10%
What's that going to be like?

00:22:38.540 --> 00:22:39.970 align:middle line:10%
Like a little
thing in your brain

00:22:39.970 --> 00:22:43.460 align:middle line:10%
literally feeding
you information,

00:22:43.460 --> 00:22:47.270 align:middle line:10%
taking your thoughts
because it probably

00:22:47.270 --> 00:22:49.760 align:middle line:10%
has got to go both ways.

00:22:49.760 --> 00:22:51.910 align:middle line:10%
That's a little weird.

00:22:51.910 --> 00:22:56.240 align:middle line:10%
It's the whole thing of privacy
just going away forever,

00:22:56.240 --> 00:22:58.340 align:middle line:10%
like forever.

00:22:58.340 --> 00:22:59.910 align:middle line:10%
How are we going to manage that?

00:22:59.910 --> 00:23:01.650 align:middle line:10%
Like, how is that
going to change people?

00:23:01.650 --> 00:23:03.530 align:middle line:10%
You're already
seeing the changes.

00:23:03.530 --> 00:23:05.060 align:middle line:10%
We don't have BCIs in our heads.

00:23:05.060 --> 00:23:09.320 align:middle line:10%
But you're seeing the
effects on the human psyche

00:23:09.320 --> 00:23:12.710 align:middle line:10%
from having less and less
privacy because everyone's

00:23:12.710 --> 00:23:14.920 align:middle line:10%
in a little fish tank now.

00:23:14.920 --> 00:23:16.600 align:middle line:10%
And you got to duck--

00:23:16.600 --> 00:23:19.360 align:middle line:10%
duck so that you don't--

00:23:19.360 --> 00:23:22.120 align:middle line:10%
just stay in your little lane.

00:23:22.120 --> 00:23:23.770 align:middle line:10%
Stay in your lane.

00:23:23.770 --> 00:23:25.840 align:middle line:10%
So that's one thing.

00:23:25.840 --> 00:23:33.430 align:middle line:84%
It's a transformation that is
happening underway right now.

00:23:33.430 --> 00:23:37.690 align:middle line:10%
We're going into this,
as I call, Stage 4.

00:23:37.690 --> 00:23:43.870 align:middle line:10%
And I'll say further that
our species is being shaped

00:23:43.870 --> 00:23:49.600 align:middle line:10%
to conform with the
infrastructure we are creating

00:23:49.600 --> 00:23:53.040 align:middle line:10%
or that is actually now
creating itself almost.

00:23:53.040 --> 00:23:55.050 align:middle line:10%
This is something--
I actually said this

00:23:55.050 --> 00:23:58.140 align:middle line:10%
on my website a few months ago.

00:23:58.140 --> 00:24:00.630 align:middle line:10%
And I haven't really
fully worked it out.

00:24:00.630 --> 00:24:05.260 align:middle line:10%
But I'm quite convinced of the
phrase, we serve the system.

00:24:05.260 --> 00:24:06.390 align:middle line:10%
We serve the system.

00:24:06.390 --> 00:24:07.390 align:middle line:10%
And what does that mean?

00:24:07.390 --> 00:24:10.020 align:middle line:10%
Well, I realize, we've--

00:24:10.020 --> 00:24:13.830 align:middle line:10%
throughout our history, we've
created systems of existence

00:24:13.830 --> 00:24:16.620 align:middle line:10%
to serve our needs, so we think.

00:24:16.620 --> 00:24:21.780 align:middle line:10%
But the reality is that a
human being must conform

00:24:21.780 --> 00:24:24.720 align:middle line:10%
to the rules of the system
that he or she is in

00:24:24.720 --> 00:24:26.220 align:middle line:10%
or you pay a penalty.

00:24:26.220 --> 00:24:28.410 align:middle line:84%
In ancient times, when
you're a hunter and gatherer,

00:24:28.410 --> 00:24:30.270 align:middle line:84%
the system was your
natural environment.

00:24:30.270 --> 00:24:32.730 align:middle line:10%
And you better
adhere to the rules,

00:24:32.730 --> 00:24:35.280 align:middle line:10%
like defend yourself
against wild animals,

00:24:35.280 --> 00:24:36.900 align:middle line:10%
or you're going to die.

00:24:36.900 --> 00:24:39.240 align:middle line:10%
Build a shelter, or
you're going to die.

00:24:39.240 --> 00:24:42.820 align:middle line:10%
There are certain rules that you
have to follow in that system.

00:24:42.820 --> 00:24:43.930 align:middle line:10%
And we did a great job.

00:24:43.930 --> 00:24:44.730 align:middle line:10%
And we did it.

00:24:44.730 --> 00:24:46.800 align:middle line:10%
And then we started
developing a kind

00:24:46.800 --> 00:24:49.950 align:middle line:10%
of an artificial
environment with Stage 2,

00:24:49.950 --> 00:24:53.560 align:middle line:10%
where we're controlling
animals now.

00:24:53.560 --> 00:24:55.220 align:middle line:10%
We never did that before.

00:24:55.220 --> 00:24:57.170 align:middle line:10%
We're like, cows, you're
working for us now.

00:24:57.170 --> 00:24:57.680 align:middle line:10%
We're going to grow you.

00:24:57.680 --> 00:24:58.490 align:middle line:10%
We're going to keep you here.

00:24:58.490 --> 00:24:59.240 align:middle line:10%
We're going to feed you.

00:24:59.240 --> 00:25:00.448 align:middle line:10%
We're going to eat you later.

00:25:00.448 --> 00:25:02.200 align:middle line:10%
But you're going
to live with us.

00:25:02.200 --> 00:25:04.130 align:middle line:10%
Wolves, you're going
to become dogs.

00:25:04.130 --> 00:25:05.668 align:middle line:10%
Chickens, get over here.

00:25:05.668 --> 00:25:07.460 align:middle line:10%
Plants, we're going to
remake you and grow.

00:25:07.460 --> 00:25:09.335 align:middle line:10%
You're going to become
wheat and all of that.

00:25:09.335 --> 00:25:10.900 align:middle line:10%
So we just take it for granted.

00:25:10.900 --> 00:25:13.310 align:middle line:10%
We control this natural world.

00:25:13.310 --> 00:25:16.540 align:middle line:10%
And we've created over
these various stages--

00:25:16.540 --> 00:25:17.968 align:middle line:10%
look what we're in.

00:25:17.968 --> 00:25:19.010 align:middle line:10%
We're in the Luxor Hotel.

00:25:19.010 --> 00:25:20.320 align:middle line:10%
Could you imagine
what would be like

00:25:20.320 --> 00:25:21.880 align:middle line:10%
if we took one of those
hunters and gatherers

00:25:21.880 --> 00:25:22.970 align:middle line:10%
and brought them here?

00:25:22.970 --> 00:25:24.710 align:middle line:10%
They would lose their mind.

00:25:24.710 --> 00:25:27.460 align:middle line:10%
They would actually
probably lose their mind.

00:25:27.460 --> 00:25:30.875 align:middle line:10%
But we've created a completely
artificial environment.

00:25:30.875 --> 00:25:32.000 align:middle line:10%
Again, we take for granted.

00:25:32.000 --> 00:25:32.570 align:middle line:10%
We're used to it.

00:25:32.570 --> 00:25:33.410 align:middle line:10%
We're adaptable.

00:25:33.410 --> 00:25:35.680 align:middle line:10%
It's good for us.

00:25:35.680 --> 00:25:38.030 align:middle line:10%
But we must serve the
needs of this system.

00:25:38.030 --> 00:25:39.140 align:middle line:10%
What is this system?

00:25:39.140 --> 00:25:41.860 align:middle line:10%
It's an artificial
system that relies now

00:25:41.860 --> 00:25:44.230 align:middle line:10%
on a digital infrastructure.

00:25:44.230 --> 00:25:47.500 align:middle line:10%
International shipping has got
to be exactly a certain way.

00:25:47.500 --> 00:25:50.950 align:middle line:10%
Or those goods won't go from
China to here or wherever.

00:25:50.950 --> 00:25:54.140 align:middle line:10%
There's rules and bureaucracy
that must be in place.

00:25:54.140 --> 00:25:55.190 align:middle line:10%
That's the system.

00:25:55.190 --> 00:25:56.660 align:middle line:10%
You've got to serve that system.

00:25:56.660 --> 00:25:58.300 align:middle line:10%
We created it for our needs.

00:25:58.300 --> 00:25:59.720 align:middle line:10%
But now we must serve it.

00:25:59.720 --> 00:26:01.550 align:middle line:10%
And here's the real irony.

00:26:01.550 --> 00:26:06.970 align:middle line:10%
We have now created a system
with AI in which we are not

00:26:06.970 --> 00:26:09.450 align:middle line:10%
going to be necessary.

00:26:09.450 --> 00:26:11.840 align:middle line:10%
This is important to understand.

00:26:11.840 --> 00:26:14.580 align:middle line:10%
We like to think,
oh, well, we create

00:26:14.580 --> 00:26:16.270 align:middle line:10%
these systems for our benefit.

00:26:16.270 --> 00:26:18.400 align:middle line:10%
But that's not really true.

00:26:18.400 --> 00:26:20.220 align:middle line:10%
We think they're
for our benefit.

00:26:20.220 --> 00:26:21.760 align:middle line:10%
But we must serve their needs.

00:26:21.760 --> 00:26:25.140 align:middle line:10%
There is a logic to
the infrastructure

00:26:25.140 --> 00:26:27.840 align:middle line:10%
and the technology
that we have created.

00:26:27.840 --> 00:26:29.880 align:middle line:10%
And that logic is inexorable.

00:26:29.880 --> 00:26:32.610 align:middle line:10%
And it will be obeyed.

00:26:32.610 --> 00:26:34.110 align:middle line:10%
It will be obeyed.

00:26:34.110 --> 00:26:38.870 align:middle line:10%
The logic is for maximum
efficiency of itself.

00:26:38.870 --> 00:26:39.920 align:middle line:90%
And if--

00:26:39.920 --> 00:26:42.260 align:middle line:90%
So you have corporations.

00:26:42.260 --> 00:26:46.160 align:middle line:10%
It's like if you reincarnated
Buddha or Jesus Christ

00:26:46.160 --> 00:26:48.920 align:middle line:10%
and made them the
head of ExxonMobil.

00:26:48.920 --> 00:26:52.790 align:middle line:10%
Do you think they'd be able
to change a thing about how

00:26:52.790 --> 00:26:54.440 align:middle line:10%
that corporation is run?

00:26:54.440 --> 00:26:56.020 align:middle line:10%
No.

00:26:56.020 --> 00:26:57.250 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:26:57.250 --> 00:27:01.270 align:middle line:84%
The corporation has its
own inexorable logic

00:27:01.270 --> 00:27:03.650 align:middle line:90%
that must be followed.

00:27:03.650 --> 00:27:07.670 align:middle line:10%
And if the profits aren't there,
well, they get booted out.

00:27:07.670 --> 00:27:08.810 align:middle line:10%
They're no longer CEO.

00:27:08.810 --> 00:27:10.540 align:middle line:10%
And that's the reality.

00:27:10.540 --> 00:27:12.650 align:middle line:10%
So we must serve the system.

00:27:12.650 --> 00:27:14.090 align:middle line:10%
It has its own logic.

00:27:14.090 --> 00:27:17.590 align:middle line:10%
30 plus years ago, Bill
Joy, one of the co-founders

00:27:17.590 --> 00:27:21.163 align:middle line:10%
of Sun Microsystems, famously
said, hey, this AI, we

00:27:21.163 --> 00:27:23.080 align:middle line:10%
got to stop this right
now because this is not

00:27:23.080 --> 00:27:24.200 align:middle line:10%
going to go well for us.

00:27:24.200 --> 00:27:26.350 align:middle line:10%
It's going to-- and
everyone was looking at him

00:27:26.350 --> 00:27:29.270 align:middle line:10%
like, What drugs are you taking?

00:27:29.270 --> 00:27:33.850 align:middle line:10%
Like, how do you see this
as even remotely possible?

00:27:33.850 --> 00:27:36.100 align:middle line:10%
And indeed, there wasn't.

00:27:36.100 --> 00:27:38.200 align:middle line:10%
There wasn't any way
that anyone could see

00:27:38.200 --> 00:27:40.270 align:middle line:10%
because corporations compete.

00:27:40.270 --> 00:27:41.230 align:middle line:10%
Nations compete.

00:27:41.230 --> 00:27:42.440 align:middle line:10%
Militaries compete.

00:27:42.440 --> 00:27:44.420 align:middle line:10%
That has to be developed.

00:27:44.420 --> 00:27:47.390 align:middle line:10%
AI, from their point
of view, has to happen.

00:27:47.390 --> 00:27:50.130 align:middle line:10%
There is no way around it.

00:27:50.130 --> 00:27:53.620 align:middle line:84%
There are too many forces in
the world that were pushing it.

00:27:53.620 --> 00:27:58.050 align:middle line:84%
And so we as a
species are forced

00:27:58.050 --> 00:28:02.960 align:middle line:84%
to conform to the
needs of the system.

00:28:02.960 --> 00:28:04.300 align:middle line:90%
We serve the system.

00:28:04.300 --> 00:28:07.900 align:middle line:84%
That's, in a nutshell,
my thought on that.

00:28:07.900 --> 00:28:12.750 align:middle line:84%
So transhumanism, post-humanism,
it is becoming a fact.

00:28:12.750 --> 00:28:17.060 align:middle line:10%
When will it become a
reality, a true reality?

00:28:17.060 --> 00:28:17.860 align:middle line:10%
I don't know.

00:28:17.860 --> 00:28:20.620 align:middle line:10%
I don't know if it's 20
years, maybe less, maybe more.

00:28:20.620 --> 00:28:22.060 align:middle line:10%
I don't know.

00:28:22.060 --> 00:28:28.300 align:middle line:10%
But for the same reasons that
AI is a fact, which will be--

00:28:28.300 --> 00:28:31.150 align:middle line:10%
you can imagine parents
wanting their kids

00:28:31.150 --> 00:28:33.267 align:middle line:10%
to get maybe a little
bit of extra advantage.

00:28:33.267 --> 00:28:35.350 align:middle line:10%
We'll do a little genetic
tweaking here, make them

00:28:35.350 --> 00:28:40.620 align:middle line:10%
a little bit better immune
system or a little smarter

00:28:40.620 --> 00:28:41.910 align:middle line:10%
or whatever.

00:28:41.910 --> 00:28:44.790 align:middle line:10%
I guarantee you there's going
to be negative repercussions

00:28:44.790 --> 00:28:46.373 align:middle line:10%
that no one is predicting.

00:28:46.373 --> 00:28:47.790 align:middle line:10%
We're going to see
"Jurassic Park"

00:28:47.790 --> 00:28:51.060 align:middle line:10%
on a wide scale in the sense
of unintended consequences.

00:28:51.060 --> 00:28:51.990 align:middle line:10%
That will happen.

00:28:51.990 --> 00:28:55.670 align:middle line:10%
But it will not stop
this from happening.

00:28:55.670 --> 00:28:58.260 align:middle line:10%
Transhumanism,
you mark my words,

00:28:58.260 --> 00:29:00.900 align:middle line:10%
that's going to happen in
the next generation and two

00:29:00.900 --> 00:29:02.680 align:middle line:10%
generations and then beyond.

00:29:02.680 --> 00:29:04.030 align:middle line:10%
It's off to the races.

00:29:04.030 --> 00:29:07.480 align:middle line:10%
So what is changing
in our world?

00:29:07.480 --> 00:29:10.020 align:middle line:10%
Well, pretty much everything
is changing, right down

00:29:10.020 --> 00:29:14.170 align:middle line:10%
to the fundamentals of what
it means to be a human being,

00:29:14.170 --> 00:29:16.560 align:middle line:10%
that is, your family relations.

00:29:16.560 --> 00:29:19.380 align:middle line:84%
You think about
how families were.

00:29:19.380 --> 00:29:21.450 align:middle line:84%
Back in the old
country, my mom, they're

00:29:21.450 --> 00:29:24.780 align:middle line:84%
all Italian Americans-- cheek
pinching, back slapping,

00:29:24.780 --> 00:29:25.660 align:middle line:90%
in your face.

00:29:25.660 --> 00:29:27.930 align:middle line:90%
Hey, Richie, get over here.

00:29:27.930 --> 00:29:28.860 align:middle line:10%
I grew up with that.

00:29:28.860 --> 00:29:30.700 align:middle line:10%
And I love and
miss those people.

00:29:30.700 --> 00:29:31.550 align:middle line:10%
They were the best.

00:29:31.550 --> 00:29:32.350 align:middle line:10%
They were the best.

00:29:32.350 --> 00:29:34.950 align:middle line:10%
And I'm sure all of you
have your own version

00:29:34.950 --> 00:29:37.000 align:middle line:10%
of that kind of family memory.

00:29:37.000 --> 00:29:41.870 align:middle line:10%
And I would like to think
that that will continue.

00:29:41.870 --> 00:29:45.430 align:middle line:10%
But there's a little nagging
concern that it won't.

00:29:45.430 --> 00:29:46.790 align:middle line:10%
Something's changing.

00:29:46.790 --> 00:29:51.070 align:middle line:10%
Family relationships
are changing.

00:29:51.070 --> 00:29:55.910 align:middle line:10%
How we form our communities
is fundamentally changing.

00:29:55.910 --> 00:29:59.170 align:middle line:84%
These are basic facts of what
it means to be a human being--

00:29:59.170 --> 00:30:04.690 align:middle line:84%
how we find our husband or wife
or boyfriend or girlfriend,

00:30:04.690 --> 00:30:06.870 align:middle line:90%
how we court and mate.

00:30:06.870 --> 00:30:09.950 align:middle line:10%
But actually-- I said
husband and wife at first.

00:30:09.950 --> 00:30:12.950 align:middle line:10%
But that's going away.

00:30:12.950 --> 00:30:16.040 align:middle line:10%
You see, the world that we've
created destroys marriages.

00:30:16.040 --> 00:30:18.060 align:middle line:10%
I mean, it just destroys them.

00:30:18.060 --> 00:30:19.060 align:middle line:10%
We see it.

00:30:19.060 --> 00:30:22.230 align:middle line:10%
So that's changing.

00:30:22.230 --> 00:30:24.660 align:middle line:10%
Food, how you do your food--

00:30:24.660 --> 00:30:26.080 align:middle line:10%
I'm sure some of you are great.

00:30:26.080 --> 00:30:29.010 align:middle line:10%
I know some of you
are amazing cooks.

00:30:29.010 --> 00:30:32.140 align:middle line:10%
But a lot of people
don't cook anymore.

00:30:32.140 --> 00:30:36.360 align:middle line:10%
We've become sort of
divorced from our food--

00:30:36.360 --> 00:30:38.320 align:middle line:10%
how we eat it,
how we prepare it.

00:30:38.320 --> 00:30:39.780 align:middle line:10%
All of that's different.

00:30:39.780 --> 00:30:43.200 align:middle line:10%
We have a different
relationship to something

00:30:43.200 --> 00:30:46.590 align:middle line:10%
as basic and fundamental
as the food that we eat.

00:30:46.590 --> 00:30:51.350 align:middle line:10%
How kids grow up, how
we look at each other--

00:30:51.350 --> 00:30:53.530 align:middle line:10%
that's changing.

00:30:53.530 --> 00:30:56.300 align:middle line:84%
That's why I picked this
photograph, this picture here,

00:30:56.300 --> 00:30:57.100 align:middle line:90%
right?

00:30:57.100 --> 00:30:59.110 align:middle line:84%
How many times
have you seen that?

00:30:59.110 --> 00:31:03.830 align:middle line:10%
And our level of privacy
is dramatically changing.

00:31:03.830 --> 00:31:05.990 align:middle line:10%
You may not feel it in
your day to day life.

00:31:05.990 --> 00:31:06.820 align:middle line:10%
I understand that.

00:31:06.820 --> 00:31:09.260 align:middle line:10%
If you're a public person,
you probably do feel it.

00:31:09.260 --> 00:31:12.580 align:middle line:10%
But even if you're someone
who's got a Facebook page

00:31:12.580 --> 00:31:15.760 align:middle line:10%
and your family and friends
are on it, you feel it anyway.

00:31:15.760 --> 00:31:17.410 align:middle line:10%
You feel it anyway.

00:31:17.410 --> 00:31:18.430 align:middle line:10%
You know.

00:31:18.430 --> 00:31:20.630 align:middle line:10%
OK, there's all these eyes here.

00:31:20.630 --> 00:31:24.110 align:middle line:10%
And that just gets
bigger and bigger.

00:31:24.110 --> 00:31:26.480 align:middle line:10%
So these aren't trivial things.

00:31:26.480 --> 00:31:29.112 align:middle line:10%
These are fundamental
things about what

00:31:29.112 --> 00:31:30.320 align:middle line:10%
it means to be a human being.

00:31:30.320 --> 00:31:32.680 align:middle line:10%
And all of it's
changing, basically

00:31:32.680 --> 00:31:34.480 align:middle line:10%
in the snap of a finger.

00:31:34.480 --> 00:31:37.520 align:middle line:10%
And you could say
these are good changes.

00:31:37.520 --> 00:31:42.410 align:middle line:10%
Yeah, some of them are-- we love
them all when they seem new.

00:31:42.410 --> 00:31:45.015 align:middle line:10%
But then we see a
lot of the effects.

00:31:45.015 --> 00:31:49.260 align:middle line:90%


00:31:49.260 --> 00:31:53.190 align:middle line:10%
On a more basic political,
social level, other things

00:31:53.190 --> 00:31:55.740 align:middle line:10%
are also changing--
the internet.

00:31:55.740 --> 00:31:59.310 align:middle line:10%
Maybe what I'm saying on the top
here is a little extreme but not

00:31:59.310 --> 00:32:00.170 align:middle line:10%
too much.

00:32:00.170 --> 00:32:02.310 align:middle line:10%
I say it's turning back into TV.

00:32:02.310 --> 00:32:03.670 align:middle line:90%
OK, not totally.

00:32:03.670 --> 00:32:05.860 align:middle line:90%
It's not quite like 1980s.

00:32:05.860 --> 00:32:07.680 align:middle line:90%
Ugh, remember that.

00:32:07.680 --> 00:32:11.470 align:middle line:84%
There's a little bit more on
the web than 1980s television.

00:32:11.470 --> 00:32:14.220 align:middle line:10%
But you can see
the guard rails--

00:32:14.220 --> 00:32:18.150 align:middle line:10%
and that's the word we hear
all the time-- are there.

00:32:18.150 --> 00:32:22.980 align:middle line:10%
You know, the monitoring
against harm to you.

00:32:22.980 --> 00:32:25.360 align:middle line:10%
If you read the wrong
thing, that could harm you.

00:32:25.360 --> 00:32:28.450 align:middle line:10%
So we need to curate your news.

00:32:28.450 --> 00:32:30.920 align:middle line:10%
You hear that word
a lot-- curating.

00:32:30.920 --> 00:32:33.780 align:middle line:10%
That's just a nice word
for censoring, of course.

00:32:33.780 --> 00:32:35.643 align:middle line:10%
It's turning back
into TV, only worse.

00:32:35.643 --> 00:32:37.810 align:middle line:10%
And the worst part is that
it's looking back at you.

00:32:37.810 --> 00:32:40.140 align:middle line:10%
That's like the Big
Brother out of Orwell.

00:32:40.140 --> 00:32:44.500 align:middle line:10%
Your internet's looking at you
every time you're on there.

00:32:44.500 --> 00:32:46.550 align:middle line:10%
So that's not too cool.

00:32:46.550 --> 00:32:47.550 align:middle line:10%
But that's happening.

00:32:47.550 --> 00:32:49.760 align:middle line:10%
The surveillance
state is all around.

00:32:49.760 --> 00:32:51.950 align:middle line:10%
Again, it tries to
make itself invisible.

00:32:51.950 --> 00:32:53.560 align:middle line:10%
It does a good job
a lot of the time.

00:32:53.560 --> 00:32:55.120 align:middle line:10%
But it's all there.

00:32:55.120 --> 00:32:56.210 align:middle line:10%
It's always there.

00:32:56.210 --> 00:32:58.800 align:middle line:10%
And you know it's there.

00:32:58.800 --> 00:33:00.550 align:middle line:84%
And along with that,
of course, everything

00:33:00.550 --> 00:33:04.690 align:middle line:84%
else that follows-- a radical
reduction in permissible speech.

00:33:04.690 --> 00:33:06.830 align:middle line:84%
I just read an
article a week ago.

00:33:06.830 --> 00:33:09.250 align:middle line:84%
A couple of women in the UK
got arrested because they put

00:33:09.250 --> 00:33:10.510 align:middle line:90%
the wrong thing on Facebook.

00:33:10.510 --> 00:33:12.070 align:middle line:90%
And they're in jail.

00:33:12.070 --> 00:33:14.170 align:middle line:10%
They expressed the
wrong opinion, whatever.

00:33:14.170 --> 00:33:16.128 align:middle line:10%
And I'm not going to get
into that whole thing.

00:33:16.128 --> 00:33:23.450 align:middle line:10%
But UK arresting and imprisoning
two women for a Facebook post--

00:33:23.450 --> 00:33:26.050 align:middle line:10%
I mean, this is insane.

00:33:26.050 --> 00:33:28.000 align:middle line:10%
By the way, the English
Commonwealth nations

00:33:28.000 --> 00:33:31.270 align:middle line:10%
are some of the
worst now by far in--

00:33:31.270 --> 00:33:33.280 align:middle line:10%
I mean, I feel like,
how different are you

00:33:33.280 --> 00:33:34.670 align:middle line:10%
from China at this point?

00:33:34.670 --> 00:33:35.810 align:middle line:10%
Not very.

00:33:35.810 --> 00:33:37.450 align:middle line:10%
Not very.

00:33:37.450 --> 00:33:38.803 align:middle line:10%
The US is still better off.

00:33:38.803 --> 00:33:40.220 align:middle line:10%
We still have the
First Amendment.

00:33:40.220 --> 00:33:41.650 align:middle line:10%
I mean, thank God.

00:33:41.650 --> 00:33:43.870 align:middle line:10%
That's our saving grace.

00:33:43.870 --> 00:33:49.390 align:middle line:10%
But the UK, Canada,
Australia, and New Zealand--

00:33:49.390 --> 00:33:51.130 align:middle line:10%
not so great.

00:33:51.130 --> 00:33:52.570 align:middle line:10%
Not so great.

00:33:52.570 --> 00:33:54.790 align:middle line:10%
Digital control over
your money will increase.

00:33:54.790 --> 00:33:57.560 align:middle line:84%
And that can happen
at any time now.

00:33:57.560 --> 00:34:00.490 align:middle line:84%
And it will be more likely
once you start seeing

00:34:00.490 --> 00:34:01.793 align:middle line:90%
digital currencies rolled out.

00:34:01.793 --> 00:34:02.710 align:middle line:90%
They're not there yet.

00:34:02.710 --> 00:34:04.120 align:middle line:90%
But that will happen.

00:34:04.120 --> 00:34:06.010 align:middle line:10%
The whole issue of
AI and employment--

00:34:06.010 --> 00:34:08.110 align:middle line:10%
I mentioned before
the fear of job loss.

00:34:08.110 --> 00:34:10.070 align:middle line:10%
And obviously, that will happen.

00:34:10.070 --> 00:34:11.980 align:middle line:10%
Yeah, jobs will be created.

00:34:11.980 --> 00:34:16.449 align:middle line:10%
But it will really be the
same amount that are lost,

00:34:16.449 --> 00:34:20.199 align:middle line:10%
maybe in the long term with a
radical reduction in population

00:34:20.199 --> 00:34:21.500 align:middle line:10%
and a reorganization.

00:34:21.500 --> 00:34:24.100 align:middle line:10%
But for right now,
for our lifetimes,

00:34:24.100 --> 00:34:27.610 align:middle line:10%
I think it's going to be very,
very difficult, very tough.

00:34:27.610 --> 00:34:30.969 align:middle line:10%
And that's a whole other
problem that we are not

00:34:30.969 --> 00:34:34.909 align:middle line:10%
dealing with very well
as a society at all.

00:34:34.909 --> 00:34:39.760 align:middle line:10%
And then the BCI,
Brain-Computer Interface--

00:34:39.760 --> 00:34:40.758 align:middle line:10%
can you imagine?

00:34:40.758 --> 00:34:42.800 align:middle line:10%
I mean, let's just put
some things together here.

00:34:42.800 --> 00:34:46.295 align:middle line:10%
So I'm having a conversation
with my BCI with some friend.

00:34:46.295 --> 00:34:49.010 align:middle line:10%


00:34:49.010 --> 00:34:51.409 align:middle line:10%
And then you've got
AI algorithms probably

00:34:51.409 --> 00:34:53.929 align:middle line:10%
monitoring every conversation.

00:34:53.929 --> 00:34:56.840 align:middle line:10%
I mean, how far away
are we from a situation

00:34:56.840 --> 00:35:00.230 align:middle line:10%
where an algorithm is going
to monitor what you say

00:35:00.230 --> 00:35:04.280 align:middle line:10%
and give a safer output
because what you're saying

00:35:04.280 --> 00:35:06.270 align:middle line:10%
is deemed harmful?

00:35:06.270 --> 00:35:09.060 align:middle line:10%
I'm starting to use
the DALL-E art program.

00:35:09.060 --> 00:35:10.890 align:middle line:10%
Canva has got a really
nice feature on it.

00:35:10.890 --> 00:35:12.510 align:middle line:10%
And I can create
some really cool art.

00:35:12.510 --> 00:35:16.200 align:middle line:10%
And I'm putting in totally
like tame subjects.

00:35:16.200 --> 00:35:18.560 align:middle line:10%
And it's telling me,
you can't do this.

00:35:18.560 --> 00:35:19.360 align:middle line:10%
You can't do that.

00:35:19.360 --> 00:35:21.360 align:middle line:10%
This violates art.

00:35:21.360 --> 00:35:24.210 align:middle line:10%
I'm just trying to create
a guy with a cowboy hat.

00:35:24.210 --> 00:35:25.210 align:middle line:10%
What's the problem here?

00:35:25.210 --> 00:35:28.000 align:middle line:10%
But it won't do it frequently.

00:35:28.000 --> 00:35:30.550 align:middle line:10%
So you already see
this happening.

00:35:30.550 --> 00:35:35.010 align:middle line:84%
And I can at least envision
this going really, really south

00:35:35.010 --> 00:35:36.437 align:middle line:90%
for us.

00:35:36.437 --> 00:35:37.770 align:middle line:90%
We're here in the United States.

00:35:37.770 --> 00:35:41.077 align:middle line:84%
And we're used to a certain
amount of freedom and privacy.

00:35:41.077 --> 00:35:42.660 align:middle line:10%
But first of all,
there's a whole rest

00:35:42.660 --> 00:35:43.618 align:middle line:10%
of the world out there.

00:35:43.618 --> 00:35:45.330 align:middle line:10%
And they're not going to get it.

00:35:45.330 --> 00:35:47.440 align:middle line:10%
They will not get the
protections that we have.

00:35:47.440 --> 00:35:49.340 align:middle line:10%
They will not get
those protections.

00:35:49.340 --> 00:35:50.910 align:middle line:10%
Not gonna happen for them.

00:35:50.910 --> 00:35:54.990 align:middle line:10%
But secondly, how long do you
think we're going to keep ours?

00:35:54.990 --> 00:35:57.480 align:middle line:84%
I hear people saying all the
time, well, we need Elon Musk.

00:35:57.480 --> 00:35:59.100 align:middle line:90%
We need to put in safeguards.

00:35:59.100 --> 00:36:00.810 align:middle line:84%
And yeah, all
right, yeah, we all

00:36:00.810 --> 00:36:03.115 align:middle line:84%
heard you got to
put in safeguards.

00:36:03.115 --> 00:36:05.490 align:middle line:84%
How long do you think those
safeguards are going to last?

00:36:05.490 --> 00:36:08.220 align:middle line:10%
One generation,
maybe two generations

00:36:08.220 --> 00:36:10.890 align:middle line:10%
if we're really lucky, 40 years?

00:36:10.890 --> 00:36:12.738 align:middle line:10%
Well, eventually,
they're going to go away

00:36:12.738 --> 00:36:14.280 align:middle line:10%
because, you know
why, there's always

00:36:14.280 --> 00:36:16.790 align:middle line:10%
going to be a new crisis
that takes them away.

00:36:16.790 --> 00:36:19.290 align:middle line:10%
It's always going to be another
one right around the corner.

00:36:19.290 --> 00:36:23.060 align:middle line:84%
Political crisis-- well, we
got an election coming up.

00:36:23.060 --> 00:36:25.087 align:middle line:90%
Oh, my dear God.

00:36:25.087 --> 00:36:26.420 align:middle line:90%
Don't even get me started there.

00:36:26.420 --> 00:36:30.490 align:middle line:84%
But I'm bringing it up
here because we've all

00:36:30.490 --> 00:36:33.830 align:middle line:84%
gone into crazy mode in
the last decade or so.

00:36:33.830 --> 00:36:38.050 align:middle line:10%
And you can see, can't you?

00:36:38.050 --> 00:36:41.940 align:middle line:10%
The justification
that a government

00:36:41.940 --> 00:36:47.700 align:middle line:10%
could have to regulate your
speech and your person even more

00:36:47.700 --> 00:36:54.050 align:middle line:10%
to prevent harm from coming
to the rest of society.

00:36:54.050 --> 00:36:57.170 align:middle line:10%
They're using that word harm
all the time for all sorts

00:36:57.170 --> 00:36:59.480 align:middle line:10%
of inappropriate ways.

00:36:59.480 --> 00:37:00.510 align:middle line:10%
But they'll do it.

00:37:00.510 --> 00:37:03.620 align:middle line:10%
So there's, in other
words, many crises

00:37:03.620 --> 00:37:09.650 align:middle line:10%
that can happen that will prompt
central powers to exacerbate

00:37:09.650 --> 00:37:13.010 align:middle line:10%
the draconian controls
that they're already

00:37:13.010 --> 00:37:18.260 align:middle line:10%
exerting over the population,
I guess, or biological.

00:37:18.260 --> 00:37:21.710 align:middle line:10%
We had COVID just a
couple of years ago.

00:37:21.710 --> 00:37:24.740 align:middle line:84%
Do we think that's never
going to happen again?

00:37:24.740 --> 00:37:27.410 align:middle line:90%
You can see.

00:37:27.410 --> 00:37:29.390 align:middle line:84%
In some labs, someone's
cooking up something.

00:37:29.390 --> 00:37:31.730 align:middle line:84%
And who knows where
that will end?

00:37:31.730 --> 00:37:33.300 align:middle line:90%
So we're just primed.

00:37:33.300 --> 00:37:35.040 align:middle line:84%
We're primed for
another great crisis.

00:37:35.040 --> 00:37:37.665 align:middle line:84%
It could be a combination of any
of the above or something else

00:37:37.665 --> 00:37:39.380 align:middle line:90%
I'm not even thinking about.

00:37:39.380 --> 00:37:44.630 align:middle line:10%
One more great crisis, maybe
two or three more great crises--

00:37:44.630 --> 00:37:47.810 align:middle line:10%
maybe that's happening
because we're

00:37:47.810 --> 00:37:51.920 align:middle line:10%
seeing this transformation
of the human species.

00:37:51.920 --> 00:37:58.500 align:middle line:10%
And to create this end result,
that's what's happening.

00:37:58.500 --> 00:38:02.150 align:middle line:90%
