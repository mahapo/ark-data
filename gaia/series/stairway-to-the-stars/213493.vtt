00:00:04.930 --> 00:00:07.395 align:middle line:90%
[THEME MUSIC]

00:00:07.395 --> 00:00:12.340 align:middle line:90%


00:00:12.340 --> 00:00:15.020 align:middle line:84%
>>JASON QUITT: All right,
so the solar ratio.

00:00:15.020 --> 00:00:19.640 align:middle line:10%
So at equinox, if you're
standing at the equator

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:22.640 align:middle line:10%
on Earth, if you're right on
the equator and on the equinox,

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:25.730 align:middle line:10%
the sun is directly
above you at 0 degrees.

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:29.980 align:middle line:10%
And then during the solstices,
it goes 23.5 degrees this way,

00:00:29.980 --> 00:00:32.180 align:middle line:10%
23.5 degrees this way.

00:00:32.180 --> 00:00:36.230 align:middle line:10%
As we move up the latitude,
let's say we go to Egypt,

00:00:36.230 --> 00:00:40.475 align:middle line:10%
the North Star rises
on the horizon, OK?

00:00:40.475 --> 00:00:44.030 align:middle line:84%
So as you move north,
the star, the North Star

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:46.410 align:middle line:90%
moves higher into the sky.

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:48.060 align:middle line:90%
This is how we get latitudes.

00:00:48.060 --> 00:00:52.370 align:middle line:10%
At Giza, Egypt is about
30 degrees latitude,

00:00:52.370 --> 00:00:56.700 align:middle line:10%
which means the North Star
is 30 degrees in the sky.

00:00:56.700 --> 00:00:58.130 align:middle line:10%
That's what it means.

00:00:58.130 --> 00:01:02.060 align:middle line:10%
And when you're moving it
up, it pushes the sun down.

00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:06.410 align:middle line:10%
So every latitude
on Earth, the sun

00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:09.630 align:middle line:10%
will be different, all right?

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:12.860 align:middle line:10%
So the sun at the equator
is right above you,

00:01:12.860 --> 00:01:16.340 align:middle line:10%
but the sun at 30
degrees, it's pushing

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:19.010 align:middle line:10%
the sun 30 degrees South.

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:20.490 align:middle line:90%
Does that make sense?

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:22.580 align:middle line:90%
So just pushing the sun down.

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:26.530 align:middle line:10%
So here's the yearly
path of the sun at Giza.

00:01:26.530 --> 00:01:28.670 align:middle line:10%
So you get these
lines, which is--

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:32.130 align:middle line:10%
the highest point is the summer
solstice, middle of the equinox.

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:34.890 align:middle line:10%
The lowest point of the
sun is the summer solstice.

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:37.880 align:middle line:10%
And it looks like this,
these three curved lines.

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:39.770 align:middle line:10%
So it's the sun is
taking these three

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:43.520 align:middle line:10%
steps up during the year and
then three steps down back

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:44.510 align:middle line:10%
to winter.

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:45.900 align:middle line:10%
And you get this ratio.

00:01:45.900 --> 00:01:47.400 align:middle line:10%
So look at this,
the eye of the sun.

00:01:47.400 --> 00:01:50.158 align:middle line:10%
So if you take these three
circles at the location,

00:01:50.158 --> 00:01:51.950 align:middle line:10%
you put them together,
you get this picture

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:54.890 align:middle line:10%
that looks like an eye, right?

00:01:54.890 --> 00:02:00.850 align:middle line:10%
This eye is a ratio of
the sun in that latitude.

00:02:00.850 --> 00:02:04.540 align:middle line:10%
So let's go to Peru,
the Gate of the Gods.

00:02:04.540 --> 00:02:06.020 align:middle line:10%
And it has this doorway.

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:08.090 align:middle line:10%
And everybody talks about
this doorway, right?

00:02:08.090 --> 00:02:10.650 align:middle line:90%
We all know this doorway, right?

00:02:10.650 --> 00:02:12.730 align:middle line:84%
Look very carefully
at this doorway.

00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:16.710 align:middle line:84%
Do you see these lines on
these-- on this doorway?

00:02:16.710 --> 00:02:18.910 align:middle line:90%
And I've been there.

00:02:18.910 --> 00:02:20.940 align:middle line:90%
This is my picture.

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:22.650 align:middle line:84%
They say these
are natural lines,

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:25.036 align:middle line:90%
natural formations, right?

00:02:25.036 --> 00:02:28.545 align:middle line:90%
But what if I measure it?

00:02:28.545 --> 00:02:35.390 align:middle line:84%
These lines are at 23.5 degrees
again, and at 15 degrees.

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:36.920 align:middle line:84%
I didn't really get
into 15 degrees.

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:40.830 align:middle line:10%
15 degrees is the movement
of the sun per hour.

00:02:40.830 --> 00:02:44.300 align:middle line:10%
So the sun moves in the
sky 15 degrees per hour.

00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:51.760 align:middle line:10%
So you do 24 times 15, you
get 360 circle, all right?

00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:56.920 align:middle line:10%
So this is the eye of the sun of
Peru, which is very different.

00:02:56.920 --> 00:02:59.520 align:middle line:10%
Look, it's a much
different ratio.

00:02:59.520 --> 00:03:07.230 align:middle line:10%
So I'm like, OK, let's see if
this ratio fits on this image.

00:03:07.230 --> 00:03:09.070 align:middle line:10%
Also, the door is tilted.

00:03:09.070 --> 00:03:10.950 align:middle line:10%
It has, like, a tilted
door at 16 degrees,

00:03:10.950 --> 00:03:13.760 align:middle line:10%
which is the latitude.

00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:16.310 align:middle line:84%
And then we place
the eye of the sun,

00:03:16.310 --> 00:03:22.900 align:middle line:84%
and the winter solstice cuts
the door exactly where it is.

00:03:22.900 --> 00:03:25.600 align:middle line:84%
And if you take those ratios
and you put it in the door,

00:03:25.600 --> 00:03:28.970 align:middle line:90%
it's a perfect match.

00:03:28.970 --> 00:03:30.570 align:middle line:90%
This is a calendar.

00:03:30.570 --> 00:03:31.950 align:middle line:90%
The door is a calendar.

00:03:31.950 --> 00:03:34.820 align:middle line:10%
It's called the
hidden door, where

00:03:34.820 --> 00:03:38.780 align:middle line:10%
at a certain time
of the year, the sun

00:03:38.780 --> 00:03:42.350 align:middle line:10%
passes through the doorway,
which is the equinox.

00:03:42.350 --> 00:03:44.330 align:middle line:10%
And if you look
closely at this image,

00:03:44.330 --> 00:03:47.390 align:middle line:10%
you can even see
these lines carved

00:03:47.390 --> 00:03:52.310 align:middle line:10%
into the side of this door, it
measures the shadow of the sun.

00:03:52.310 --> 00:03:55.150 align:middle line:84%
So if you were trained, you can
look at the shadow of the sun

00:03:55.150 --> 00:03:58.620 align:middle line:84%
and know what time
of year it is.

00:03:58.620 --> 00:03:59.803 align:middle line:90%
It's a calendar.

00:03:59.803 --> 00:04:01.470 align:middle line:84%
And then when there's
no shadow, the sun

00:04:01.470 --> 00:04:03.070 align:middle line:90%
is going right through the door.

00:04:03.070 --> 00:04:05.480 align:middle line:10%
It's the equinox.

00:04:05.480 --> 00:04:07.970 align:middle line:90%
Didn't Jesus say I am the door?

00:04:07.970 --> 00:04:09.658 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:04:09.658 --> 00:04:14.040 align:middle line:84%
OK, so the local legends
say that an Incan priest who

00:04:14.040 --> 00:04:16.170 align:middle line:84%
had the golden disk
of the sun placed

00:04:16.170 --> 00:04:20.050 align:middle line:84%
the disk in the doorway, which
was the key to open the door.

00:04:20.050 --> 00:04:23.820 align:middle line:84%
This is the same false door
solar theme retold in Sumeria

00:04:23.820 --> 00:04:26.970 align:middle line:84%
in Egypt, where the sun
is able to open the door

00:04:26.970 --> 00:04:29.670 align:middle line:84%
and pass through
it on special days.

00:04:29.670 --> 00:04:31.930 align:middle line:84%
During a specific
day of the year,

00:04:31.930 --> 00:04:34.070 align:middle line:84%
the sun will pass
through this doorway.

00:04:34.070 --> 00:04:37.560 align:middle line:10%
This is the purpose
and key to the site.

00:04:37.560 --> 00:04:40.350 align:middle line:10%
So they're literally
telling you what it is,

00:04:40.350 --> 00:04:45.440 align:middle line:10%
but I'm showing you
exactly how it works.

00:04:45.440 --> 00:04:49.190 align:middle line:10%
And here it is, the eye of
the sun and the false doors

00:04:49.190 --> 00:04:50.560 align:middle line:10%
going back to Sumeria.

00:04:50.560 --> 00:04:53.390 align:middle line:10%
You see these two false doors.

00:04:53.390 --> 00:04:55.220 align:middle line:10%
And this is in the tombs.

00:04:55.220 --> 00:04:57.540 align:middle line:10%
The Egyptian tombs
used false doors.

00:04:57.540 --> 00:04:59.180 align:middle line:10%
And it's the same story.

00:04:59.180 --> 00:05:02.420 align:middle line:10%
The spirit, the soul,
the sun can only

00:05:02.420 --> 00:05:06.860 align:middle line:10%
pass through at a very
specific day of the year

00:05:06.860 --> 00:05:10.200 align:middle line:10%
so that it could regain
its ka, its energy.

00:05:10.200 --> 00:05:14.065 align:middle line:10%
So on very special days, the sun
would pass through these doors.

00:05:14.065 --> 00:05:17.460 align:middle line:90%


00:05:17.460 --> 00:05:20.340 align:middle line:84%
And now we're going to get
into the solar ratios, which

00:05:20.340 --> 00:05:24.297 align:middle line:84%
I discovered from this
image, which is Shamas.

00:05:24.297 --> 00:05:26.630 align:middle line:10%
And everybody looks at this
and they're saying you know,

00:05:26.630 --> 00:05:29.090 align:middle line:10%
Shamas is a giant,
Annunaki, this and that.

00:05:29.090 --> 00:05:32.630 align:middle line:10%
Like, look at the size of
these dinky people, right?

00:05:32.630 --> 00:05:35.070 align:middle line:10%
But it's symbolism, all right?

00:05:35.070 --> 00:05:37.850 align:middle line:10%
If you take these three people--

00:05:37.850 --> 00:05:40.490 align:middle line:10%
they're actually the three
suns-- if you put them together,

00:05:40.490 --> 00:05:42.410 align:middle line:10%
they equal the height
of Sunesh, which

00:05:42.410 --> 00:05:46.320 align:middle line:10%
is all the suns, all right?

00:05:46.320 --> 00:05:49.470 align:middle line:10%
But that's not what
I want to talk about.

00:05:49.470 --> 00:05:51.880 align:middle line:10%
Nobody really knows about
what these tools are.

00:05:51.880 --> 00:05:54.900 align:middle line:84%
It's like, you know,
ancient aliens mystery.

00:05:54.900 --> 00:05:58.060 align:middle line:10%
What are these
tools he's holding?

00:05:58.060 --> 00:06:02.410 align:middle line:10%
If you measure the
tool, that rod,

00:06:02.410 --> 00:06:05.730 align:middle line:10%
and you put it from the top
of his finger to his elbow,

00:06:05.730 --> 00:06:08.110 align:middle line:10%
it's exactly the same length.

00:06:08.110 --> 00:06:09.800 align:middle line:90%
That's the cubit measuring.

00:06:09.800 --> 00:06:10.900 align:middle line:90%
That's a ruler stick.

00:06:10.900 --> 00:06:13.630 align:middle line:84%
It's the cubit
measuring ruler stick.

00:06:13.630 --> 00:06:16.990 align:middle line:84%
And when you measure it
going across his fingers,

00:06:16.990 --> 00:06:18.760 align:middle line:84%
you're also-- it's
cutting the fingers

00:06:18.760 --> 00:06:22.050 align:middle line:84%
at exactly 23.5
degrees and 15 degrees.

00:06:22.050 --> 00:06:24.702 align:middle line:90%


00:06:24.702 --> 00:06:26.160 align:middle line:84%
And this is what
you're looking at.

00:06:26.160 --> 00:06:27.660 align:middle line:90%
You're looking at the cubit.

00:06:27.660 --> 00:06:29.210 align:middle line:90%
The cubit is your arm.

00:06:29.210 --> 00:06:32.120 align:middle line:84%
This is the measurement
from the base of your elbow

00:06:32.120 --> 00:06:35.120 align:middle line:84%
to the tip of your
middle finger.

00:06:35.120 --> 00:06:37.080 align:middle line:90%
This is the measuring stick.

00:06:37.080 --> 00:06:42.090 align:middle line:10%
You are the measuring
stick of the universe.

00:06:42.090 --> 00:06:46.920 align:middle line:10%
And a royal cubit is
just four more fingers

00:06:46.920 --> 00:06:49.210 align:middle line:10%
on top of the fingers there.

00:06:49.210 --> 00:06:50.700 align:middle line:10%
So you get the royal cubit.

00:06:50.700 --> 00:06:52.480 align:middle line:10%
And you could divide--

00:06:52.480 --> 00:06:55.450 align:middle line:10%
you can divide the cubit
in many different ways.

00:06:55.450 --> 00:06:58.477 align:middle line:84%
So you could divide it by
the hand and then the arm.

00:06:58.477 --> 00:06:59.560 align:middle line:90%
That's like two divisions.

00:06:59.560 --> 00:07:04.872 align:middle line:10%
It's almost like-- so one
cubit, one hand, one arm.

00:07:04.872 --> 00:07:06.330 align:middle line:10%
And then you could
also divide that

00:07:06.330 --> 00:07:08.260 align:middle line:10%
into 10, which is
really easy to do.

00:07:08.260 --> 00:07:13.430 align:middle line:84%
So I just put the ratios here
from 1 to 10 of the cubit.

00:07:13.430 --> 00:07:15.880 align:middle line:90%
Now, here's the solar ratio.

00:07:15.880 --> 00:07:17.230 align:middle line:90%
This is where I figured it out.

00:07:17.230 --> 00:07:19.610 align:middle line:84%
So I got the solar
ratio of Sumeria,

00:07:19.610 --> 00:07:24.380 align:middle line:84%
where this artifact was
found at 31.3 degrees.

00:07:24.380 --> 00:07:27.372 align:middle line:84%
And it created these
three circles, right?

00:07:27.372 --> 00:07:31.640 align:middle line:84%
Well, I overlaid those
circles around Shamas's hand,

00:07:31.640 --> 00:07:34.940 align:middle line:90%
and it was 100% perfect match.

00:07:34.940 --> 00:07:39.690 align:middle line:10%
So that circle that he's
holding in his hands

00:07:39.690 --> 00:07:43.710 align:middle line:10%
is the ratios of the
sun at the equinox

00:07:43.710 --> 00:07:47.250 align:middle line:10%
and the solstice at the
latitude of Sumeria,

00:07:47.250 --> 00:07:48.880 align:middle line:10%
where this artifact was found.

00:07:48.880 --> 00:07:54.210 align:middle line:84%
So they encoded the information
of the sun into these images.

00:07:54.210 --> 00:07:56.730 align:middle line:90%


00:07:56.730 --> 00:07:59.830 align:middle line:84%
Even their symbols,
if I took these ratios

00:07:59.830 --> 00:08:03.890 align:middle line:84%
and I put it into the symbols,
they were exact matches too.

00:08:03.890 --> 00:08:06.893 align:middle line:84%
So these symbols were
made from these ratios.

00:08:06.893 --> 00:08:09.810 align:middle line:90%


00:08:09.810 --> 00:08:11.490 align:middle line:90%
And just simply, like--

00:08:11.490 --> 00:08:13.090 align:middle line:84%
I could really get
into the pyramid.

00:08:13.090 --> 00:08:17.760 align:middle line:84%
but just simply put, if you
take the cubit at a 1-to-1 ratio

00:08:17.760 --> 00:08:22.080 align:middle line:84%
and you put it on the pyramid,
you can see, very easily,

00:08:22.080 --> 00:08:24.540 align:middle line:90%
how the pyramid was designed.

00:08:24.540 --> 00:08:28.590 align:middle line:84%
How they figured out where to
put things and the distances

00:08:28.590 --> 00:08:29.870 align:middle line:90%
between things.

00:08:29.870 --> 00:08:33.750 align:middle line:10%
They're just using the ratios
of the cubit and the sun.

00:08:33.750 --> 00:08:35.640 align:middle line:84%
Because remember
from the beginning,

00:08:35.640 --> 00:08:40.210 align:middle line:84%
the pyramids are to
bless and honor the sun.

00:08:40.210 --> 00:08:42.240 align:middle line:90%
They're solar symbolism.

00:08:42.240 --> 00:08:47.070 align:middle line:84%
So how is the hand of the
arm part of solar symbolism?

00:08:47.070 --> 00:08:50.760 align:middle line:10%
Like I said, you are
the measuring stick.

00:08:50.760 --> 00:08:53.790 align:middle line:10%
You know, if you hold
your arm out like this,

00:08:53.790 --> 00:08:58.720 align:middle line:10%
you stick your arm out to your
hand and you look with your eye

00:08:58.720 --> 00:09:02.820 align:middle line:10%
to your hand, the eye to the
hand with an outstretched arm,

00:09:02.820 --> 00:09:06.890 align:middle line:10%
you put it to the horizon
and the sun is in the sky,

00:09:06.890 --> 00:09:10.110 align:middle line:10%
each hand is one hour of time.

00:09:10.110 --> 00:09:16.160 align:middle line:84%
So you can count how many
hours are left in the daytime.

00:09:16.160 --> 00:09:17.880 align:middle line:90%
So you are the timekeeper.

00:09:17.880 --> 00:09:22.440 align:middle line:10%
Your body is the sun and
your hands are the degrees.

00:09:22.440 --> 00:09:26.810 align:middle line:10%
So you can see you could measure
45 degrees, 15 degrees, 23.5

00:09:26.810 --> 00:09:29.000 align:middle line:10%
degrees, 15 degrees.

00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:31.310 align:middle line:90%
The sun-- sorry.

00:09:31.310 --> 00:09:35.860 align:middle line:84%
The whole world is in your
hands, all the ratios.

00:09:35.860 --> 00:09:37.330 align:middle line:90%
So you were the measuring tool.

00:09:37.330 --> 00:09:38.810 align:middle line:84%
This is the secret
of the ancients,

00:09:38.810 --> 00:09:40.560 align:middle line:84%
is that they could
just put their hands up

00:09:40.560 --> 00:09:42.960 align:middle line:84%
and they could measure, tell
time, do all these things

00:09:42.960 --> 00:09:44.340 align:middle line:90%
just by looking at their hand.

00:09:44.340 --> 00:09:46.830 align:middle line:10%
Eye to the hand.

00:09:46.830 --> 00:09:51.037 align:middle line:84%
And this is the secret of
Leonardo da Vinci's Vitruvian

00:09:51.037 --> 00:09:51.970 align:middle line:90%
Man.

00:09:51.970 --> 00:09:58.230 align:middle line:10%
And this is Zohar
Man, Zohar Man,

00:09:58.230 --> 00:10:00.830 align:middle line:10%
because you are
connected to everything.

00:10:00.830 --> 00:10:06.060 align:middle line:84%
So if I put the 23.5 degrees,
the 15 degrees, Leonardo

00:10:06.060 --> 00:10:08.650 align:middle line:84%
and this artist both
encoded those images.

00:10:08.650 --> 00:10:12.930 align:middle line:84%
You are the solar
person, all right?

00:10:12.930 --> 00:10:18.070 align:middle line:84%
You are made from the
proportions of heaven and Earth.

00:10:18.070 --> 00:10:19.970 align:middle line:10%
And this is what
Thoth is showing us.

00:10:19.970 --> 00:10:23.680 align:middle line:10%
So this is Thoth from
the Temple of Abydos,

00:10:23.680 --> 00:10:26.810 align:middle line:10%
and it's showing you
these different angles.

00:10:26.810 --> 00:10:30.670 align:middle line:10%
The cubit, his hand
is at 10 degrees,

00:10:30.670 --> 00:10:33.460 align:middle line:10%
23.5 degrees from his eye down.

00:10:33.460 --> 00:10:37.660 align:middle line:10%
And from his arm up, the side
is 23.5 degrees to his beak.

00:10:37.660 --> 00:10:42.310 align:middle line:10%
So it's his whole body
is in these proportions.

00:10:42.310 --> 00:10:44.560 align:middle line:10%
These aren't just-- again,
these aren't just artists

00:10:44.560 --> 00:10:46.010 align:middle line:10%
making pictures.

00:10:46.010 --> 00:10:50.020 align:middle line:10%
These are scientists
literally drawing things

00:10:50.020 --> 00:10:54.130 align:middle line:10%
to show you something else.

00:10:54.130 --> 00:10:58.510 align:middle line:10%
And just to show you that, like,
you can find this anywhere,

00:10:58.510 --> 00:11:00.600 align:middle line:10%
like, I'm not just
handpicking things, so I said,

00:11:00.600 --> 00:11:02.892 align:middle line:10%
OK, I'm just going to take
an image from Graham Hancock

00:11:02.892 --> 00:11:05.080 align:middle line:10%
because he posted
this and, you know--

00:11:05.080 --> 00:11:08.040 align:middle line:10%
so someone posted this picture.

00:11:08.040 --> 00:11:09.970 align:middle line:84%
And I'm going to zoom
right in on this.

00:11:09.970 --> 00:11:11.640 align:middle line:84%
You see in that hand,
it's like holding

00:11:11.640 --> 00:11:15.510 align:middle line:84%
this ankh and the
was-scepter and it's

00:11:15.510 --> 00:11:18.270 align:middle line:90%
putting it in their face.

00:11:18.270 --> 00:11:20.097 align:middle line:90%
Let me zoom in on this.

00:11:20.097 --> 00:11:20.930 align:middle line:90%
Look at this symbol.

00:11:20.930 --> 00:11:24.140 align:middle line:90%


00:11:24.140 --> 00:11:28.820 align:middle line:84%
15 degrees, like I said, is the
movement of the sun in the sky.

00:11:28.820 --> 00:11:34.630 align:middle line:84%
With the was, if you follow the
heads of the was, 23.5 degrees.

00:11:34.630 --> 00:11:37.530 align:middle line:84%
And from the head of the
walls to the person's eye

00:11:37.530 --> 00:11:42.180 align:middle line:84%
is 45 degrees, just like what
we saw in the Leonardo da Vinci,

00:11:42.180 --> 00:11:43.830 align:middle line:84%
like, couple
thousand years later.

00:11:43.830 --> 00:11:45.870 align:middle line:10%
He's using the same
geometry over and over

00:11:45.870 --> 00:11:51.120 align:middle line:10%
again because everything you see
in Egypt, if it's a solar motif,

00:11:51.120 --> 00:11:54.540 align:middle line:10%
will follow this
principle exactly.

00:11:54.540 --> 00:11:59.220 align:middle line:10%
So these images are just encoded
with all these solar symbols,

00:11:59.220 --> 00:12:02.610 align:middle line:10%
solar ratios, solar angles.

00:12:02.610 --> 00:12:06.660 align:middle line:10%
Like, I could decode this, and
I only partially decoded this

00:12:06.660 --> 00:12:11.310 align:middle line:10%
because every part of
this image has a purpose.

00:12:11.310 --> 00:12:12.580 align:middle line:10%
So think about that.

00:12:12.580 --> 00:12:16.380 align:middle line:84%
Every single part,
even the armbands--

00:12:16.380 --> 00:12:20.640 align:middle line:84%
every part of this body
was done meticulously

00:12:20.640 --> 00:12:23.530 align:middle line:84%
to teach you something
or to show you something.

00:12:23.530 --> 00:12:26.080 align:middle line:90%
It's not just an image.

00:12:26.080 --> 00:12:27.040 align:middle line:90%
So here's the ankh.

00:12:27.040 --> 00:12:29.110 align:middle line:10%
And everybody's like,
what's the ankh?

00:12:29.110 --> 00:12:33.560 align:middle line:10%
Well, if you put 23.5 degrees
on it, it actually is perfect.

00:12:33.560 --> 00:12:36.070 align:middle line:10%
So it just shows you that
it's designed for the sun.

00:12:36.070 --> 00:12:37.010 align:middle line:10%
It's the key of life.

00:12:37.010 --> 00:12:38.560 align:middle line:10%
It's the sun and the Earth.

00:12:38.560 --> 00:12:40.540 align:middle line:10%
When you put the
cubit through it,

00:12:40.540 --> 00:12:43.300 align:middle line:10%
every part of the cubit,
the division of the cubit

00:12:43.300 --> 00:12:44.990 align:middle line:10%
is in the ankh.

00:12:44.990 --> 00:12:48.400 align:middle line:10%
The entire division of
the cubit is in the ankh.

00:12:48.400 --> 00:12:51.430 align:middle line:84%
Now, this ankh was
found in Saqqara,

00:12:51.430 --> 00:12:54.990 align:middle line:84%
so about 30 degrees
North latitude.

00:12:54.990 --> 00:12:58.300 align:middle line:84%
So I took the ratios and I
put it over the ankh, and even

00:12:58.300 --> 00:13:01.840 align:middle line:84%
the ankh, the
circles matched 100%

00:13:01.840 --> 00:13:04.490 align:middle line:90%
identical to the solar ratios.

00:13:04.490 --> 00:13:07.450 align:middle line:84%
And then on the ankh
are these lines.

00:13:07.450 --> 00:13:10.240 align:middle line:10%
And these lines are the deacons.

00:13:10.240 --> 00:13:13.780 align:middle line:84%
The 10 days of the year,
every 10 day is a deacon.

00:13:13.780 --> 00:13:19.560 align:middle line:84%
And so this follows the
yearly path of the sun.

00:13:19.560 --> 00:13:22.930 align:middle line:84%
And even on the ankh-- this
is from Tutankhamun's tomb.

00:13:22.930 --> 00:13:24.960 align:middle line:90%
It's a mere box.

00:13:24.960 --> 00:13:27.730 align:middle line:90%
Look at the imagery on the ankh.

00:13:27.730 --> 00:13:29.410 align:middle line:90%
It has the three suns.

00:13:29.410 --> 00:13:31.740 align:middle line:84%
And we're always talking
about the three suns.

00:13:31.740 --> 00:13:36.430 align:middle line:84%
And you have the center sun,
which is above the beetle.

00:13:36.430 --> 00:13:38.290 align:middle line:84%
and then the two suns
are the two serpents.

00:13:38.290 --> 00:13:40.600 align:middle line:84%
We keep seeing
these two serpents.

00:13:40.600 --> 00:13:42.600 align:middle line:90%
But here's the secret.

00:13:42.600 --> 00:13:44.165 align:middle line:10%
Do you see the eye
of the serpent?

00:13:44.165 --> 00:13:47.520 align:middle line:90%


00:13:47.520 --> 00:13:50.580 align:middle line:84%
If you put it from the base
of the lotus of the ankh

00:13:50.580 --> 00:13:54.450 align:middle line:84%
and you go up into there,
eye, what do you get?

00:13:54.450 --> 00:13:59.420 align:middle line:90%
23.5 degrees, the eyes.

00:13:59.420 --> 00:14:00.940 align:middle line:90%
Same thing with this.

00:14:00.940 --> 00:14:03.090 align:middle line:84%
This is the back of
Tutankhamen's chair.

00:14:03.090 --> 00:14:06.290 align:middle line:10%
The whole image is 23.5
degrees because this

00:14:06.290 --> 00:14:09.470 align:middle line:10%
is the secret of the pyramids.

00:14:09.470 --> 00:14:15.630 align:middle line:10%
Here is the cubit ratioed up.

00:14:15.630 --> 00:14:20.280 align:middle line:10%
And it shows you how it's
laid out as in the cubits.

00:14:20.280 --> 00:14:24.780 align:middle line:10%
But here is where
it gets incredible.

00:14:24.780 --> 00:14:29.580 align:middle line:10%
If I take the soul ratios at
30 degrees and create this eye,

00:14:29.580 --> 00:14:35.780 align:middle line:10%
and I put this eye over
Khufu, Khafre, and Menkaure,

00:14:35.780 --> 00:14:39.970 align:middle line:10%
Khufu's ratios are in
the summer solstice.

00:14:39.970 --> 00:14:43.220 align:middle line:10%
Khafre's ratios
are in the equinox.

00:14:43.220 --> 00:14:45.800 align:middle line:10%
Menkaure's is in the winter.

00:14:45.800 --> 00:14:50.935 align:middle line:84%
The ratios itself are
encoded into each pyramid.

00:14:50.935 --> 00:14:54.950 align:middle line:90%


00:14:54.950 --> 00:14:56.660 align:middle line:10%
It's like, you know,
when you get the key

00:14:56.660 --> 00:14:58.452 align:middle line:10%
and it just opens the
door and you're like,

00:14:58.452 --> 00:15:00.590 align:middle line:10%
I can't believe
this actually works?

00:15:00.590 --> 00:15:01.867 align:middle line:90%
I didn't even have to do this.

00:15:01.867 --> 00:15:03.450 align:middle line:84%
I didn't even have
to second try this.

00:15:03.450 --> 00:15:07.190 align:middle line:84%
It's just the first time I
tried it, it worked, you know?

00:15:07.190 --> 00:15:09.890 align:middle line:90%
Because this is the secret.

00:15:09.890 --> 00:15:13.400 align:middle line:84%
It's the sun and the Earth and
the movement through the stars

00:15:13.400 --> 00:15:15.950 align:middle line:84%
is how they created
the intelligence

00:15:15.950 --> 00:15:17.950 align:middle line:90%
behind these monuments.

00:15:17.950 --> 00:15:20.670 align:middle line:90%
So the hidden solar motif.

00:15:20.670 --> 00:15:23.280 align:middle line:84%
So everybody is looking at
Akhenaten and they're saying,

00:15:23.280 --> 00:15:25.442 align:middle line:90%
you know, he's so alien, right?

00:15:25.442 --> 00:15:30.870 align:middle line:10%
The reason he's alien is
Akhenaten wanted to be the sun.

00:15:30.870 --> 00:15:33.400 align:middle line:10%
He wanted to be seen as the sun.

00:15:33.400 --> 00:15:36.930 align:middle line:10%
So he put the ratios
of the sun in his body.

00:15:36.930 --> 00:15:40.450 align:middle line:10%
He changed his appearance to
fit the ratios of the sun.

00:15:40.450 --> 00:15:41.830 align:middle line:90%
And I'll show you this.

00:15:41.830 --> 00:15:44.320 align:middle line:90%
So this is an image.

00:15:44.320 --> 00:15:45.880 align:middle line:84%
If you go right
through the center,

00:15:45.880 --> 00:15:50.380 align:middle line:84%
you can see that through
his eyes are 23.5 degrees.

00:15:50.380 --> 00:15:52.960 align:middle line:84%
From his belly button,
it goes through the eyes

00:15:52.960 --> 00:15:55.600 align:middle line:90%
of the two children.

00:15:55.600 --> 00:15:58.790 align:middle line:84%
From her arm, it goes
through 23.5 degrees,

00:15:58.790 --> 00:16:01.160 align:middle line:90%
the eyes of the other children.

00:16:01.160 --> 00:16:05.790 align:middle line:84%
Everything in this image
is based on 23.5 degrees.

00:16:05.790 --> 00:16:10.010 align:middle line:84%
And so now I'm going to
do the cubit on this.

00:16:10.010 --> 00:16:16.150 align:middle line:84%
Every part of this image is
also done in the cubit ratio.

00:16:16.150 --> 00:16:21.170 align:middle line:84%
Now, I just put the solar
ratio here of where this is,

00:16:21.170 --> 00:16:25.820 align:middle line:84%
and depending on
the sun, their heads

00:16:25.820 --> 00:16:29.720 align:middle line:84%
are in different ratios
that are exact to the sun

00:16:29.720 --> 00:16:32.317 align:middle line:90%
in that location.

00:16:32.317 --> 00:16:34.400 align:middle line:10%
So now we're going to get
into the Dendera lights.

00:16:34.400 --> 00:16:36.930 align:middle line:90%


00:16:36.930 --> 00:16:39.130 align:middle line:90%
Again, look at this.

00:16:39.130 --> 00:16:42.090 align:middle line:84%
The blue lines are 15
degrees and the red lines

00:16:42.090 --> 00:16:44.190 align:middle line:90%
are 23.5 degrees.

00:16:44.190 --> 00:16:46.300 align:middle line:84%
Going from the
eyes to the navel,

00:16:46.300 --> 00:16:49.830 align:middle line:84%
all the eyes and
the navels line up

00:16:49.830 --> 00:16:53.640 align:middle line:90%
to 23.5 degrees and 15 degrees.

00:16:53.640 --> 00:16:55.180 align:middle line:90%
And again, the two serpents.

00:16:55.180 --> 00:16:57.630 align:middle line:90%
What are the two serpents?

00:16:57.630 --> 00:17:02.120 align:middle line:10%
It's the movement of the
sun between the solstices.

00:17:02.120 --> 00:17:08.470 align:middle line:10%
Even the Djed Pillar is
tilted at 23.5 degrees.

00:17:08.470 --> 00:17:15.460 align:middle line:10%
Now, if I overlay the cubit
ratios over this image,

00:17:15.460 --> 00:17:18.540 align:middle line:10%
you get something really,
really interesting.

00:17:18.540 --> 00:17:22.720 align:middle line:10%
If you add up the
distance of this,

00:17:22.720 --> 00:17:30.650 align:middle line:10%
you get 36.5 cubit or 365
days of the solar year.

00:17:30.650 --> 00:17:35.930 align:middle line:10%
OK, so this image is actually
a calendar of the solar year.

00:17:35.930 --> 00:17:38.900 align:middle line:84%
Now, I'm going to jump from
Egypt all the way to Birthing

00:17:38.900 --> 00:17:42.010 align:middle line:90%
Rock, in Utah.

00:17:42.010 --> 00:17:44.000 align:middle line:84%
Look at the shape
of these beings.

00:17:44.000 --> 00:17:47.000 align:middle line:90%
Look at the serpent.

00:17:47.000 --> 00:17:52.245 align:middle line:84%
Their bodies are 23.5
degrees, cutting the serpent.

00:17:52.245 --> 00:17:55.670 align:middle line:90%


00:17:55.670 --> 00:17:57.410 align:middle line:90%
But it gets even crazier.

00:17:57.410 --> 00:18:01.410 align:middle line:10%
If I overlay the cubit over
it, just like I did in Egypt,

00:18:01.410 --> 00:18:03.360 align:middle line:10%
you get the exact same results.

00:18:03.360 --> 00:18:07.220 align:middle line:10%
You get 365 days.

00:18:07.220 --> 00:18:10.250 align:middle line:10%
So how is there
a calendar that's

00:18:10.250 --> 00:18:15.410 align:middle line:10%
exactly the same geometry
wise and cubic wise

00:18:15.410 --> 00:18:16.710 align:middle line:10%
from Egypt and Utah?

00:18:16.710 --> 00:18:20.180 align:middle line:10%
How is that possible,
unless somebody taught them

00:18:20.180 --> 00:18:22.508 align:middle line:10%
how to do this?

00:18:22.508 --> 00:18:24.050 align:middle line:10%
And if you look at
the bodies, here's

00:18:24.050 --> 00:18:29.870 align:middle line:10%
the solar ratio from
Utah at 39 degrees.

00:18:29.870 --> 00:18:34.640 align:middle line:10%
And you can see on the far
right, the smallest one,

00:18:34.640 --> 00:18:37.910 align:middle line:10%
see how he has the legs, they're
kind of like a flat line?

00:18:37.910 --> 00:18:42.980 align:middle line:10%
It goes right to the
winter solstice ratio.

00:18:42.980 --> 00:18:47.540 align:middle line:10%
As he's standing up, it's
going to the equinox.

00:18:47.540 --> 00:18:49.610 align:middle line:84%
He doesn't have a
head, by the way.

00:18:49.610 --> 00:18:52.220 align:middle line:84%
And as he's standing
up, goes to the summer.

00:18:52.220 --> 00:18:57.110 align:middle line:10%
So even the three
deities are representing

00:18:57.110 --> 00:19:04.980 align:middle line:10%
the stepping up or the standing
up of the sun during the year.

00:19:04.980 --> 00:19:08.380 align:middle line:10%
Again, it's like the Djed
Pillar is at 23.5 degrees.

00:19:08.380 --> 00:19:09.970 align:middle line:10%
It's the rising of the Djed.

00:19:09.970 --> 00:19:10.770 align:middle line:10%
You understand?

00:19:10.770 --> 00:19:15.760 align:middle line:10%
It's the rising of the
sun, movement of the Earth.

00:19:15.760 --> 00:19:19.960 align:middle line:10%
Here is an artifact
from Karahan Tepe.

00:19:19.960 --> 00:19:21.710 align:middle line:10%
Very weird artifact.

00:19:21.710 --> 00:19:25.120 align:middle line:10%
But I want you to look at
what's on this artifact.

00:19:25.120 --> 00:19:28.040 align:middle line:10%
We've seen that petroglyph
all over the place.

00:19:28.040 --> 00:19:29.710 align:middle line:10%
I've already shown
you this petroglyph.

00:19:29.710 --> 00:19:31.450 align:middle line:10%
What does that
petroglyph represent?

00:19:31.450 --> 00:19:34.700 align:middle line:10%
It's the summer
solstice sun, right?

00:19:34.700 --> 00:19:37.090 align:middle line:10%
And underneath it,
you've got these four

00:19:37.090 --> 00:19:40.630 align:middle line:10%
lines and two vertical lines
and four lines under that.

00:19:40.630 --> 00:19:43.960 align:middle line:10%
This is probably the oldest
representation of a Djed Pillar

00:19:43.960 --> 00:19:46.300 align:middle line:10%
on the planet from Turkey.

00:19:46.300 --> 00:19:48.700 align:middle line:10%
This is about 12,000 years old.

00:19:48.700 --> 00:19:53.080 align:middle line:10%
Now, I took this,
like, I copied this

00:19:53.080 --> 00:19:56.200 align:middle line:10%
and I put it over a Djed
Pillar from the Valley

00:19:56.200 --> 00:19:59.080 align:middle line:10%
of the Queens in Egypt,
and it was literally

00:19:59.080 --> 00:20:02.420 align:middle line:10%
a perfect match in ratio.

00:20:02.420 --> 00:20:03.930 align:middle line:90%
And this is-- what is it?

00:20:03.930 --> 00:20:07.290 align:middle line:84%
8,000 years difference or
7,000 years difference.

00:20:07.290 --> 00:20:12.850 align:middle line:10%
You have but the same thing
in two different places?

00:20:12.850 --> 00:20:16.570 align:middle line:10%
And again, it follows exactly
the ratios of the cubit.

00:20:16.570 --> 00:20:20.490 align:middle line:84%
So this knowledge of
the cubit and the sun.

00:20:20.490 --> 00:20:23.010 align:middle line:90%
Goes back 12,000 years.

00:20:23.010 --> 00:20:25.830 align:middle line:90%
It has not been broken.

00:20:25.830 --> 00:20:30.690 align:middle line:10%
So here's the very famous
pillar 43 at Gobekli Tepe.

00:20:30.690 --> 00:20:31.930 align:middle line:90%
And I'll just go back.

00:20:31.930 --> 00:20:34.097 align:middle line:84%
Everybody's looking at this
and going, oh, you know,

00:20:34.097 --> 00:20:36.450 align:middle line:84%
the handbags, everybody's
talking about the handbags.

00:20:36.450 --> 00:20:38.250 align:middle line:90%
It's not a handbag.

00:20:38.250 --> 00:20:42.450 align:middle line:10%
It's the horizon of
the Earth and the arc

00:20:42.450 --> 00:20:46.580 align:middle line:10%
of the sky, the path of the sun.

00:20:46.580 --> 00:20:48.770 align:middle line:84%
Remember, I told you,
the secret is the eyes?

00:20:48.770 --> 00:20:51.650 align:middle line:84%
If you take the eyes,
the point of the eyes

00:20:51.650 --> 00:20:54.050 align:middle line:84%
and you draw them
to match each other,

00:20:54.050 --> 00:20:59.020 align:middle line:84%
every eye connects in this
picture at 24 degrees.

00:20:59.020 --> 00:21:00.220 align:middle line:90%
Guess what.

00:21:00.220 --> 00:21:04.090 align:middle line:10%
The Earth's tilt was 24
degrees 12,000 years ago.

00:21:04.090 --> 00:21:05.450 align:middle line:10%
It wasn't 23.5.

00:21:05.450 --> 00:21:08.560 align:middle line:10%
It was 24 degrees.

00:21:08.560 --> 00:21:10.470 align:middle line:10%
OK?

00:21:10.470 --> 00:21:12.470 align:middle line:84%
And when I put the
solar ratio over it,

00:21:12.470 --> 00:21:13.790 align:middle line:90%
the ratios fit perfectly.

00:21:13.790 --> 00:21:21.150 align:middle line:84%
Look at the solar ratio
for Turkey on the handbags.

00:21:21.150 --> 00:21:23.740 align:middle line:84%
The winter solstice
fits perfectly.

00:21:23.740 --> 00:21:25.470 align:middle line:90%
The equinox fits perfectly.

00:21:25.470 --> 00:21:27.520 align:middle line:84%
And the summer solstice
fits perfectly.

00:21:27.520 --> 00:21:32.700 align:middle line:10%
The ratios are right in the
handbags, exactly the same.

00:21:32.700 --> 00:21:38.290 align:middle line:10%
And what's really interesting
is by the handbags,

00:21:38.290 --> 00:21:41.970 align:middle line:10%
they show you a baby
bird on the far left,

00:21:41.970 --> 00:21:48.360 align:middle line:10%
squirrel in the middle, and
a frog at the far right.

00:21:48.360 --> 00:21:51.330 align:middle line:10%
During the winter
solstice, that is

00:21:51.330 --> 00:21:57.320 align:middle line:10%
when all the birds lay and
hatch their eggs in Turkey.

00:21:57.320 --> 00:21:59.240 align:middle line:84%
During the equinoxes,
that is the time

00:21:59.240 --> 00:22:03.970 align:middle line:84%
when squirrels are the most
active, both equinoxes.

00:22:03.970 --> 00:22:08.320 align:middle line:84%
And in summer solstice, that's
when the frogs awaken and start

00:22:08.320 --> 00:22:09.748 align:middle line:90%
singing.

00:22:09.748 --> 00:22:11.290 align:middle line:10%
So even without
knowing this, they're

00:22:11.290 --> 00:22:13.900 align:middle line:10%
showing you the animal
for each season of the sun

00:22:13.900 --> 00:22:16.210 align:middle line:10%
right there on the pillar.

00:22:16.210 --> 00:22:19.270 align:middle line:10%
And also, the pillar showing
you all these other lines that

00:22:19.270 --> 00:22:23.200 align:middle line:10%
was cut in half, it's actually
showing you the path of the sun

00:22:23.200 --> 00:22:25.040 align:middle line:10%
through the Zodiac of heaven.

00:22:25.040 --> 00:22:30.670 align:middle line:10%
It's showing you Cygnus, Aquila,
Lyra, Draco, the North pole,

00:22:30.670 --> 00:22:35.020 align:middle line:10%
the North ecliptic pole, the
celestial pole, showing you

00:22:35.020 --> 00:22:38.440 align:middle line:10%
underneath Scorpius,
Hydra, Lupus,

00:22:38.440 --> 00:22:40.220 align:middle line:10%
and Taurus and then the duck.

00:22:40.220 --> 00:22:42.820 align:middle line:10%
Nobody understands the duck.

00:22:42.820 --> 00:22:46.630 align:middle line:10%
But the duck is the Earth, and
the oldest gods of the Earth

00:22:46.630 --> 00:22:51.347 align:middle line:10%
were duck gods, if
you believe it or not.

00:22:51.347 --> 00:22:52.430 align:middle line:10%
It's an interesting story.

00:22:52.430 --> 00:22:55.150 align:middle line:10%
The reason ducks
are so important is

00:22:55.150 --> 00:23:01.280 align:middle line:10%
because a duck dives
under the water,

00:23:01.280 --> 00:23:04.940 align:middle line:10%
so the duck is able to
live in the underworld.

00:23:04.940 --> 00:23:06.440 align:middle line:10%
It goes on land.

00:23:06.440 --> 00:23:07.830 align:middle line:10%
Walks on land.

00:23:07.830 --> 00:23:09.550 align:middle line:90%
And it could fly in the air.

00:23:09.550 --> 00:23:13.060 align:middle line:84%
So the duck was the master
of the three worlds.

00:23:13.060 --> 00:23:15.410 align:middle line:84%
That's why they were
considered the greatest

00:23:15.410 --> 00:23:17.160 align:middle line:90%
god, because they were the--

00:23:17.160 --> 00:23:20.710 align:middle line:84%
they had dominion
on three worlds.

00:23:20.710 --> 00:23:22.510 align:middle line:84%
That's why the
duck was important.

00:23:22.510 --> 00:23:26.600 align:middle line:10%
But what you're looking at on
Pillar 43 is actually this.

00:23:26.600 --> 00:23:29.410 align:middle line:10%
This is what you're
looking at, the Milky

00:23:29.410 --> 00:23:33.460 align:middle line:10%
Way and the constellations
and the movement

00:23:33.460 --> 00:23:34.550 align:middle line:10%
of the sun through it.

00:23:34.550 --> 00:23:36.010 align:middle line:10%
That is what you're looking at.

00:23:36.010 --> 00:23:39.880 align:middle line:84%
So 12,000 years ago, they
recorded what I showed you

00:23:39.880 --> 00:23:43.830 align:middle line:84%
at the beginning that Leonardo
da Vinci recorded in his

00:23:43.830 --> 00:23:44.630 align:middle line:90%
painting.

00:23:44.630 --> 00:23:46.160 align:middle line:90%
It's exactly the same thing.

00:23:46.160 --> 00:23:47.920 align:middle line:90%
Exactly the same angles.

00:23:47.920 --> 00:23:52.150 align:middle line:10%
Here's another handbag
from Iran 3,000 BC.

00:23:52.150 --> 00:23:54.118 align:middle line:10%
So this is 5,000 years old.

00:23:54.118 --> 00:23:55.910 align:middle line:10%
I want you to look
carefully at this image.

00:23:55.910 --> 00:23:58.160 align:middle line:10%
You have the two
scorpions on the side.

00:23:58.160 --> 00:24:00.160 align:middle line:10%
He's holding these two leopards.

00:24:00.160 --> 00:24:03.220 align:middle line:10%
If you put the solar
degrees of Iran on it,

00:24:03.220 --> 00:24:04.670 align:middle line:10%
it shows you the degrees.

00:24:04.670 --> 00:24:09.590 align:middle line:10%
But if you look at this from the
eye to the skirts, 15 degrees.

00:24:09.590 --> 00:24:12.296 align:middle line:10%
From the skirt to the--

00:24:12.296 --> 00:24:17.960 align:middle line:10%
from the plane of the skirt
to the eye of the leopard

00:24:17.960 --> 00:24:21.180 align:middle line:10%
or the jaguar, 23.5 degrees.

00:24:21.180 --> 00:24:23.970 align:middle line:10%
So this is all over the world.

00:24:23.970 --> 00:24:28.370 align:middle line:84%
It's showing us the exact same
thing, the exact same knowledge.

00:24:28.370 --> 00:24:29.790 align:middle line:90%
This is the oldest Hamza.

00:24:29.790 --> 00:24:33.330 align:middle line:10%
Remember I told you, the
eye to the hand to the sky,

00:24:33.330 --> 00:24:35.990 align:middle line:10%
this is the secret,
the eye to the hand.

00:24:35.990 --> 00:24:41.320 align:middle line:10%
Here's an eye in the
hand, 12,000 years old.

00:24:41.320 --> 00:24:44.050 align:middle line:84%
So I took the degrees
of where this was found

00:24:44.050 --> 00:24:46.180 align:middle line:90%
and I got the solar ratio.

00:24:46.180 --> 00:24:50.360 align:middle line:84%
Check this out if I just put
the solar ratio above that.

00:24:50.360 --> 00:24:55.740 align:middle line:84%
They're literally put the
ratio of the sun in the hand.

00:24:55.740 --> 00:25:00.890 align:middle line:84%
And also, it's designed at
24 degrees and 15 degrees.

00:25:00.890 --> 00:25:04.250 align:middle line:10%
And if we go all the way
to Moundville, Alabama,

00:25:04.250 --> 00:25:07.020 align:middle line:10%
you get these things
called the copper gorgets.

00:25:07.020 --> 00:25:11.370 align:middle line:10%
And it's also showing you a
hand with the eye in it, right?

00:25:11.370 --> 00:25:13.890 align:middle line:10%
It's also showing you
these weird circles.

00:25:13.890 --> 00:25:16.470 align:middle line:10%
And check out this
gorget on the right.

00:25:16.470 --> 00:25:18.160 align:middle line:10%
It actually shows
you the three steps.

00:25:18.160 --> 00:25:22.320 align:middle line:10%
Remember the symbology
of the three steps?

00:25:22.320 --> 00:25:24.630 align:middle line:10%
Again, if I took the
yearly path of the sun

00:25:24.630 --> 00:25:28.290 align:middle line:10%
for Moundville, Alabama, and I
overlaid it on these circles,

00:25:28.290 --> 00:25:29.555 align:middle line:10%
it's 100% match.

00:25:29.555 --> 00:25:32.080 align:middle line:10%


00:25:32.080 --> 00:25:37.240 align:middle line:10%
Same thing in Chaco canyon,
the sun dagger, it comes over

00:25:37.240 --> 00:25:41.050 align:middle line:10%
and it shows you the
sunlight on this petroglyph

00:25:41.050 --> 00:25:44.170 align:middle line:10%
at the different
times of the year.

00:25:44.170 --> 00:25:46.870 align:middle line:10%
This is, like,
literally everywhere,

00:25:46.870 --> 00:25:50.620 align:middle line:10%
the same thing over
and over again.

00:25:50.620 --> 00:25:54.765 align:middle line:10%
Mississippi culture,
check out its eye.

00:25:54.765 --> 00:25:57.290 align:middle line:90%


00:25:57.290 --> 00:26:00.390 align:middle line:90%
23.5 degrees, 45 degrees.

00:26:00.390 --> 00:26:04.070 align:middle line:84%
So this is the Birdman
Forked Eye motif.

00:26:04.070 --> 00:26:05.170 align:middle line:90%
See the three circles?

00:26:05.170 --> 00:26:07.730 align:middle line:90%


00:26:07.730 --> 00:26:13.080 align:middle line:84%
It has to do with the eye
of the falcon or Horus.

00:26:13.080 --> 00:26:14.770 align:middle line:90%
It's the same, same thing.

00:26:14.770 --> 00:26:15.990 align:middle line:10%
It's the sun.

00:26:15.990 --> 00:26:17.380 align:middle line:10%
Horus is the falcon.

00:26:17.380 --> 00:26:18.610 align:middle line:10%
His body is the upper world.

00:26:18.610 --> 00:26:21.930 align:middle line:10%
His eyes are the sun and the
moon looking towards the Eastern

00:26:21.930 --> 00:26:23.080 align:middle line:10%
or Western horizon.

00:26:23.080 --> 00:26:28.890 align:middle line:10%
So remember, when it's
looking to the east,

00:26:28.890 --> 00:26:30.100 align:middle line:10%
it's the birth of the sun.

00:26:30.100 --> 00:26:33.300 align:middle line:84%
Looking to the West, it's
the death of the sun.

00:26:33.300 --> 00:26:37.870 align:middle line:10%
When it's looking both
ways, it's the equinox.

00:26:37.870 --> 00:26:41.740 align:middle line:10%
That's where we get these
double-headed birds symbology.

00:26:41.740 --> 00:26:43.470 align:middle line:10%
And this is from Turkey.

00:26:43.470 --> 00:26:45.100 align:middle line:10%
And look at the talons.

00:26:45.100 --> 00:26:47.830 align:middle line:10%
It's holding these two spheres.

00:26:47.830 --> 00:26:49.790 align:middle line:10%
Obviously, I had
to check this out.

00:26:49.790 --> 00:26:52.910 align:middle line:10%
So I took the yearly
solar path at 40 degrees.

00:26:52.910 --> 00:26:55.060 align:middle line:10%
I got this ratio of the sun.

00:26:55.060 --> 00:26:56.270 align:middle line:10%
I put it over it again.

00:26:56.270 --> 00:27:00.320 align:middle line:10%
It's a perfect match, 15
degrees, 23.5 degrees,

00:27:00.320 --> 00:27:06.020 align:middle line:10%
and the solar ratios are
inside, making this image.

00:27:06.020 --> 00:27:07.980 align:middle line:10%
Same thing is found in Peru.

00:27:07.980 --> 00:27:13.490 align:middle line:10%
Look at the eyes, the
forked eyes, the serpents.

00:27:13.490 --> 00:27:16.340 align:middle line:10%
Now, this is interesting
because on the right

00:27:16.340 --> 00:27:19.040 align:middle line:10%
is an artifact
from Karahan Tepe.

00:27:19.040 --> 00:27:20.730 align:middle line:10%
And look at the image.

00:27:20.730 --> 00:27:24.410 align:middle line:10%
It has this circle on it, the
same three circles and this kind

00:27:24.410 --> 00:27:28.170 align:middle line:10%
of 23.5 degree cone.

00:27:28.170 --> 00:27:32.600 align:middle line:10%
And it's the same thing that's
found thousands of years later

00:27:32.600 --> 00:27:37.045 align:middle line:10%
in America, exactly the same
thing, exactly the same thing.

00:27:37.045 --> 00:27:39.700 align:middle line:10%


00:27:39.700 --> 00:27:43.210 align:middle line:10%
So we got the fork-eyed motif
at Serpent Mound, Oklahoma,

00:27:43.210 --> 00:27:46.990 align:middle line:10%
and the Sumerian
eye tablet 3500 BC.

00:27:46.990 --> 00:27:48.290 align:middle line:90%
Same thing.

00:27:48.290 --> 00:27:49.090 align:middle line:90%
Look at the eyes.

00:27:49.090 --> 00:27:51.280 align:middle line:84%
These are called
eye idols in Sumeria

00:27:51.280 --> 00:27:54.530 align:middle line:84%
with the sun, the solar disk
in the center with the rope.

00:27:54.530 --> 00:27:58.740 align:middle line:10%
And it's the same thing on
this artifact in America.

00:27:58.740 --> 00:28:04.220 align:middle line:84%
Sumerian artifact in America,
but its Native American.

00:28:04.220 --> 00:28:07.670 align:middle line:10%
And here's the Uruk
eye idols, which are

00:28:07.670 --> 00:28:11.040 align:middle line:10%
the oldest idols in Sumeria.

00:28:11.040 --> 00:28:14.130 align:middle line:10%
Some of these go back
over 6,000 years.

00:28:14.130 --> 00:28:17.736 align:middle line:84%
And nobody understands
what these are.

00:28:17.736 --> 00:28:21.760 align:middle line:10%
They're E.T. They're E.T, right?

00:28:21.760 --> 00:28:23.180 align:middle line:10%
So what do I do?

00:28:23.180 --> 00:28:28.440 align:middle line:10%
I take the solar path
and I put it over it.

00:28:28.440 --> 00:28:32.150 align:middle line:10%
And again, it follows
the exact same principles

00:28:32.150 --> 00:28:33.870 align:middle line:10%
as what we've discussed.

00:28:33.870 --> 00:28:38.370 align:middle line:90%
Here is a carved guy from Egypt.

00:28:38.370 --> 00:28:43.430 align:middle line:84%
Again, this is over 6,000 years
old, over 6,000 years old.

00:28:43.430 --> 00:28:46.490 align:middle line:90%
Look at how weird this guy is.

00:28:46.490 --> 00:28:48.900 align:middle line:90%
Look at his face.

00:28:48.900 --> 00:28:52.090 align:middle line:84%
He's got these two eyes here
and two eyes on the chest.

00:28:52.090 --> 00:28:56.090 align:middle line:90%


00:28:56.090 --> 00:28:59.300 align:middle line:10%
His face is at 23.5 degrees.

00:28:59.300 --> 00:29:02.070 align:middle line:10%
If you take it from the center,
it goes through these two suns,

00:29:02.070 --> 00:29:03.560 align:middle line:10%
it's 15 degrees.

00:29:03.560 --> 00:29:06.320 align:middle line:10%
But what's even more
amazing about this

00:29:06.320 --> 00:29:11.100 align:middle line:10%
is you see on the bottom here,
I put solar path 25.9 degrees

00:29:11.100 --> 00:29:15.770 align:middle line:10%
North Dakota, Egypt,
the line degree

00:29:15.770 --> 00:29:19.710 align:middle line:10%
at 25.9 degrees of
the summer solstice,

00:29:19.710 --> 00:29:24.770 align:middle line:10%
that line is an identical
match to the line of how

00:29:24.770 --> 00:29:28.840 align:middle line:10%
they cut the sides of the
body of this artifact.

00:29:28.840 --> 00:29:30.090 align:middle line:90%
So think about it.

00:29:30.090 --> 00:29:35.090 align:middle line:84%
They put the latitude of the
sun and the tilt of the Earth,

00:29:35.090 --> 00:29:38.400 align:middle line:84%
and they encoded it
into the idol artifact.

00:29:38.400 --> 00:29:42.290 align:middle line:10%
Now, if you understood that this
teaching-- and you knew this,

00:29:42.290 --> 00:29:46.070 align:middle line:10%
if someone gave you this
artifact and you measured it,

00:29:46.070 --> 00:29:49.560 align:middle line:10%
you would know where the
temple was on the planet Earth.

00:29:49.560 --> 00:29:52.590 align:middle line:10%
It's an ancient GPS system.

00:29:52.590 --> 00:29:55.500 align:middle line:10%
And again, it's like,
so here's yearly path

00:29:55.500 --> 00:29:56.790 align:middle line:10%
of the sun, 30 degrees.

00:29:56.790 --> 00:30:01.110 align:middle line:10%
Egypt, you see how the sun
is pushing the solstice

00:30:01.110 --> 00:30:03.600 align:middle line:10%
and the equinox is
down 30 degrees.

00:30:03.600 --> 00:30:07.680 align:middle line:10%
If you overlay that on
the Aker Lions, it's--

00:30:07.680 --> 00:30:12.210 align:middle line:10%
the whole image is designed to
hide this information of the sun

00:30:12.210 --> 00:30:13.840 align:middle line:10%
at that location.

00:30:13.840 --> 00:30:16.470 align:middle line:10%
So I'm going to come back,
I'm going to come back

00:30:16.470 --> 00:30:20.490 align:middle line:10%
to recent times, the
crucifixion of the Christ

00:30:20.490 --> 00:30:24.360 align:middle line:10%
in the monastery
of Kosovo, 1347.

00:30:24.360 --> 00:30:26.470 align:middle line:10%
This is on "Ancient
Aliens" all the time,

00:30:26.470 --> 00:30:29.280 align:middle line:10%
so I want to show this.

00:30:29.280 --> 00:30:32.270 align:middle line:84%
You have these two things
on the side of the image.

00:30:32.270 --> 00:30:33.850 align:middle line:90%
They're like spaceships, right?

00:30:33.850 --> 00:30:36.690 align:middle line:90%


00:30:36.690 --> 00:30:37.855 align:middle line:90%
Let's zoom in on this one.

00:30:37.855 --> 00:30:38.980 align:middle line:90%
You have to look carefully.

00:30:38.980 --> 00:30:40.960 align:middle line:90%
There's dots on this image.

00:30:40.960 --> 00:30:44.970 align:middle line:84%
You see these dots, the ones
at the front of the ship?

00:30:44.970 --> 00:30:46.840 align:middle line:90%
This guy's arm is down.

00:30:46.840 --> 00:30:49.270 align:middle line:84%
You got four dots up
there, four dots up there,

00:30:49.270 --> 00:30:51.060 align:middle line:90%
and these two star things.

00:30:51.060 --> 00:30:53.380 align:middle line:84%
23.5 degrees goes
through the eye.

00:30:53.380 --> 00:30:56.790 align:middle line:10%
Now, if I put the tilt
at 42 degrees of Kosovo,

00:30:56.790 --> 00:30:59.500 align:middle line:10%
it goes through these other
stars and these other marks.

00:30:59.500 --> 00:31:02.368 align:middle line:10%
It's like they hid this
information right in the scene.

00:31:02.368 --> 00:31:03.910 align:middle line:84%
This one's a little
more complicated.

00:31:03.910 --> 00:31:04.960 align:middle line:90%
It's the summer solstice.

00:31:04.960 --> 00:31:09.480 align:middle line:10%
It's the blazing sun,
and it has all the angles

00:31:09.480 --> 00:31:13.290 align:middle line:10%
hidden within it of 23.5
degrees, and even the hours

00:31:13.290 --> 00:31:15.870 align:middle line:10%
and the movement of
the 45 degree angle.

00:31:15.870 --> 00:31:20.650 align:middle line:10%
So remember at the beginning, I
talked about the three windows

00:31:20.650 --> 00:31:21.450 align:middle line:10%
or the three doors?

00:31:21.450 --> 00:31:24.080 align:middle line:10%
Did you see the
doors on the sides?

00:31:24.080 --> 00:31:27.110 align:middle line:10%
These two entrances?

00:31:27.110 --> 00:31:33.620 align:middle line:10%
If you draw the entrance to
these things, it's 23.5 degrees.

00:31:33.620 --> 00:31:36.200 align:middle line:84%
And OK, so you see, one
is the winter solstice.

00:31:36.200 --> 00:31:37.710 align:middle line:90%
One is the summer solstice.

00:31:37.710 --> 00:31:39.140 align:middle line:90%
One arm is down.

00:31:39.140 --> 00:31:40.530 align:middle line:90%
One arm is up.

00:31:40.530 --> 00:31:41.560 align:middle line:90%
These are symbolism.

00:31:41.560 --> 00:31:42.360 align:middle line:90%
One arm is up.

00:31:42.360 --> 00:31:43.700 align:middle line:90%
One arm is down.

00:31:43.700 --> 00:31:45.270 align:middle line:90%
One arm is up.

00:31:45.270 --> 00:31:47.000 align:middle line:90%
One arm is down.

00:31:47.000 --> 00:31:48.540 align:middle line:10%
One arm is up.

00:31:48.540 --> 00:31:50.870 align:middle line:10%
One arm is down.

00:31:50.870 --> 00:31:53.720 align:middle line:10%
This is Mithra, the sun.

00:31:53.720 --> 00:31:55.820 align:middle line:10%
These are the light bearers.

00:31:55.820 --> 00:31:58.590 align:middle line:10%
Light bearer one is
up-- summer solstice.

00:31:58.590 --> 00:32:02.240 align:middle line:10%
Light bearer on the
other side, it's down--

00:32:02.240 --> 00:32:03.510 align:middle line:10%
winter solstice.

00:32:03.510 --> 00:32:06.710 align:middle line:10%
Mithra is killing the
bull, which is Taurus.

00:32:06.710 --> 00:32:08.630 align:middle line:10%
Look what's underneath Taurus--

00:32:08.630 --> 00:32:12.840 align:middle line:10%
the scorpion, Scorpio.

00:32:12.840 --> 00:32:16.330 align:middle line:10%
Everything we're talking
about, I've just gone--

00:32:16.330 --> 00:32:18.870 align:middle line:10%
I don't know how many minutes
I've gone through this,

00:32:18.870 --> 00:32:22.060 align:middle line:10%
but everything that I showed
you is exactly the same thing.

00:32:22.060 --> 00:32:26.250 align:middle line:10%
I'm just saying this exact
same thing over and over again,

00:32:26.250 --> 00:32:30.340 align:middle line:10%
but with different things
over different time.

00:32:30.340 --> 00:32:31.515 align:middle line:10%
So are you getting this yet?

00:32:31.515 --> 00:32:32.340 align:middle line:10%
[CROWD CHATTER]

00:32:32.340 --> 00:32:33.670 align:middle line:10%
OK.

00:32:33.670 --> 00:32:35.260 align:middle line:10%
OK, thank you.

00:32:35.260 --> 00:32:38.760 align:middle line:10%
[CHUCKLES] So you're
looking-- every image

00:32:38.760 --> 00:32:41.550 align:middle line:10%
I'm showing you is exactly
the same, just different ways

00:32:41.550 --> 00:32:44.000 align:middle line:10%
of showing this.

00:32:44.000 --> 00:32:47.305 align:middle line:84%
Every image is the same, it's
just trying to show you this.

00:32:47.305 --> 00:32:50.050 align:middle line:90%


00:32:50.050 --> 00:32:54.070 align:middle line:10%
Same thing, it's just
showing you this.

00:32:54.070 --> 00:32:56.890 align:middle line:10%
And you-- this is the
most important part of all

00:32:56.890 --> 00:32:58.180 align:middle line:10%
mysticism--

00:32:58.180 --> 00:33:02.740 align:middle line:10%
you are the reflection
of the universe.

00:33:02.740 --> 00:33:05.345 align:middle line:10%
Everything that you see around
you, all the sacred geometry,

00:33:05.345 --> 00:33:06.970 align:middle line:10%
the movement of the
stars, the movement

00:33:06.970 --> 00:33:10.150 align:middle line:10%
of the sun, the elements,
the natural forces around you

00:33:10.150 --> 00:33:12.380 align:middle line:10%
are encoded within
the physical body.

00:33:12.380 --> 00:33:13.180 align:middle line:10%
You are the key.

00:33:13.180 --> 00:33:15.020 align:middle line:10%
You are the measuring tool.

00:33:15.020 --> 00:33:19.350 align:middle line:10%
And that is the
basic understanding

of-- all mysticism comes
back to this understanding.

00:33:23.100 --> 00:33:27.270 align:middle line:10%
You are the cosmic person.

00:33:27.270 --> 00:33:29.320 align:middle line:90%
And this is the code.

00:33:29.320 --> 00:33:31.880 align:middle line:90%
This is all just the code.

00:33:31.880 --> 00:33:38.180 align:middle line:10%
So after all this, the
only question that remains

00:33:38.180 --> 00:33:40.830 align:middle line:10%
is who taught them this?

00:33:40.830 --> 00:33:44.950 align:middle line:10%
Who went around the entire
planet for 12,000 years

00:33:44.950 --> 00:33:48.130 align:middle line:10%
and taught civilizations
this language?

00:33:48.130 --> 00:33:49.390 align:middle line:90%
It's a language.

00:33:49.390 --> 00:33:51.970 align:middle line:90%
It's a hidden language.

00:33:51.970 --> 00:33:53.625 align:middle line:90%
Who taught them this?

00:33:53.625 --> 00:33:57.440 align:middle line:90%


00:33:57.440 --> 00:33:59.760 align:middle line:10%
That is the mystery here.

00:33:59.760 --> 00:34:02.150 align:middle line:10%
That is the absolute mystery.

00:34:02.150 --> 00:34:04.920 align:middle line:84%
We went through 265
slides, by the way.

00:34:04.920 --> 00:34:07.320 align:middle line:90%
265.
