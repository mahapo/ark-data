00:00:08.313 --> 00:00:11.740 align:middle line:90%


00:00:11.740 --> 00:00:13.030 align:middle line:90%
>> Very nice to see you all.

00:00:13.030 --> 00:00:16.129 align:middle line:84%
Thank you so much for
being here this morning.

00:00:16.129 --> 00:00:17.510 align:middle line:90%
I'm thrilled to be here.

00:00:17.510 --> 00:00:20.230 align:middle line:10%
I want to thank Jimmy
and Adrian for having me

00:00:20.230 --> 00:00:23.060 align:middle line:10%
at the event and all of you
for being here this morning.

00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:26.530 align:middle line:10%
My topic this morning
is soul transfiguration.

00:00:26.530 --> 00:00:29.530 align:middle line:84%
And the idea is that behind
all the world's myths

00:00:29.530 --> 00:00:33.820 align:middle line:84%
and spiritual traditions, all
this ancient technology that we

00:00:33.820 --> 00:00:36.670 align:middle line:84%
talk about and
extraterrestrial influence,

00:00:36.670 --> 00:00:39.500 align:middle line:84%
there's a soul
technology as well.

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:44.510 align:middle line:10%
And it's about our transmutation
into a higher form of being.

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:46.270 align:middle line:84%
The ancients, I believe,
referred to them

00:00:46.270 --> 00:00:47.770 align:middle line:90%
as star walkers.

00:00:47.770 --> 00:00:49.360 align:middle line:84%
And that's a theme
that we're going

00:00:49.360 --> 00:00:52.130 align:middle line:84%
to be developing in my
presentation this morning.

00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:54.310 align:middle line:10%
And I want to just spend
a couple of minutes

00:00:54.310 --> 00:00:59.380 align:middle line:10%
right off the bat talking
about my new logo or brand,

00:00:59.380 --> 00:01:01.600 align:middle line:10%
because it
encapsulates everything

00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:04.810 align:middle line:10%
that I've been doing for
the past 30 years or so

00:01:04.810 --> 00:01:08.645 align:middle line:10%
and hope to be doing for
the next 30 years or more.

00:01:08.645 --> 00:01:10.280 align:middle line:90%
It's a star walker.

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:12.000 align:middle line:90%
It's from ancient Egypt.

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:15.290 align:middle line:84%
And what we see is a figure
holding a magic stick,

00:01:15.290 --> 00:01:17.390 align:middle line:84%
a resurrection
stick in his hand.

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:19.500 align:middle line:10%
And in one hand, and
then the other hand,

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:21.120 align:middle line:10%
he's got holding a star.

00:01:21.120 --> 00:01:23.790 align:middle line:10%
He is brought in the
power of the stars.

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:26.210 align:middle line:10%
And he's traveling on what
the ancient Egyptians referred

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:30.890 align:middle line:10%
to as the Ark of the Millions of
Years or the Ship of Eternity.

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:33.380 align:middle line:84%
And the reason why
I've started to adopt

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:37.490 align:middle line:84%
this as my new logo or
brand actually started

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:38.570 align:middle line:90%
earlier this year.

00:01:38.570 --> 00:01:44.000 align:middle line:10%
I was in a really, really
deep, visionary meditation,

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:45.110 align:middle line:10%
the kind where--

00:01:45.110 --> 00:01:47.570 align:middle line:10%
I'm sure you've had this
experience where your heart is

00:01:47.570 --> 00:01:49.910 align:middle line:10%
just bursting open
with the serotonin,

00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:52.700 align:middle line:10%
your neurosecretory
system is firing,

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:55.190 align:middle line:10%
clicking out all these
molecules and hormones

00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:57.380 align:middle line:10%
that are switching reality.

00:01:57.380 --> 00:02:00.230 align:middle line:84%
And the next thing
I know, I'm in what

00:02:00.230 --> 00:02:03.420 align:middle line:84%
I perceive to be an
ancient Egyptian temple.

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:06.320 align:middle line:84%
But it was unlike
the typical temples

00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:08.720 align:middle line:84%
I've been in Egypt
for the past 20 years

00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:13.430 align:middle line:84%
or so because it was so much
more beautiful and more immense.

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:16.820 align:middle line:84%
And the colors
were almost living.

00:02:16.820 --> 00:02:19.953 align:middle line:84%
And I was just in this
awe-inspired state

00:02:19.953 --> 00:02:20.870 align:middle line:90%
as I'm looking around.

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:23.900 align:middle line:84%
And all of a sudden over
here, I see this purple throne

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:25.520 align:middle line:90%
filled with stars.

00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:28.980 align:middle line:84%
And I'm like, wow, I
know about those thrones.

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:31.980 align:middle line:84%
I study those thrones
in the temples of Egypt.

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:33.827 align:middle line:84%
They often have
feathers on them,

00:02:33.827 --> 00:02:35.660 align:middle line:84%
or they're filled with
stars because they're

00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:37.470 align:middle line:90%
vehicles for ascension.

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:39.900 align:middle line:84%
The gods ride around
on these things.

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:42.740 align:middle line:84%
They're like the
chariot of the gods.

00:02:42.740 --> 00:02:44.267 align:middle line:90%
Solomon had his magic carpet.

00:02:44.267 --> 00:02:46.100 align:middle line:84%
But what they don't
talk about is the throne

00:02:46.100 --> 00:02:49.315 align:middle line:84%
that was on the magic carpet
that made the magic carpet fly.

00:02:49.315 --> 00:02:53.060 align:middle line:84%
And here I am just
face to face with what

00:02:53.060 --> 00:02:55.620 align:middle line:84%
appears to be like one
of the original ones.

00:02:55.620 --> 00:02:59.180 align:middle line:10%
And I'm realizing instantly that
what we experience here on Earth

00:02:59.180 --> 00:03:03.530 align:middle line:10%
is a tiny fragment of
the greater reality,

00:03:03.530 --> 00:03:05.750 align:middle line:10%
and that the temples
that we have on Earth

00:03:05.750 --> 00:03:09.590 align:middle line:10%
are mirror images of these
more vast and spectacular

00:03:09.590 --> 00:03:10.710 align:middle line:10%
cosmic temples.

00:03:10.710 --> 00:03:12.870 align:middle line:90%
And I think that's where I was.

00:03:12.870 --> 00:03:19.420 align:middle line:84%
And all of a sudden, there
is an iridescent rainbow

00:03:19.420 --> 00:03:25.720 align:middle line:84%
colored, almost like a peacock
mermaid's tail on the throne.

00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:27.700 align:middle line:84%
And I instantly
recognized that there's

00:03:27.700 --> 00:03:29.710 align:middle line:90%
a feminine form on the throne.

00:03:29.710 --> 00:03:33.430 align:middle line:84%
Although, I can't see her,
but she's talking to me.

00:03:33.430 --> 00:03:37.240 align:middle line:84%
And she says, William,
your work in ancient Egypt

00:03:37.240 --> 00:03:39.550 align:middle line:84%
with the star boats, the
Ark of the Millions of Years

00:03:39.550 --> 00:03:41.060 align:middle line:90%
is beautiful.

00:03:41.060 --> 00:03:43.480 align:middle line:90%
And I said, well, thank you.

00:03:43.480 --> 00:03:45.740 align:middle line:84%
And she's like-- I'm like,
I'm talking to a mermaid.

00:03:45.740 --> 00:03:47.750 align:middle line:84%
And here she's saying, my
work in Egypt is beautiful.

00:03:47.750 --> 00:03:48.583 align:middle line:90%
I'm like, thank you.

00:03:48.583 --> 00:03:52.010 align:middle line:84%
She's like, no, it's
really beautiful.

00:03:52.010 --> 00:03:54.320 align:middle line:90%
And I'm feeling it inside.

00:03:54.320 --> 00:03:57.670 align:middle line:84%
And then she says,
you know that picture

00:03:57.670 --> 00:04:01.030 align:middle line:84%
you've been trying to get in
the Egyptian Museum in Cairo

00:04:01.030 --> 00:04:02.840 align:middle line:90%
for these past 10 years?

00:04:02.840 --> 00:04:06.220 align:middle line:84%
And I'm like, yeah, I
do know that picture,

00:04:06.220 --> 00:04:07.910 align:middle line:90%
but how do you know about that?

00:04:07.910 --> 00:04:10.960 align:middle line:90%
And she goes, that's you.

00:04:10.960 --> 00:04:13.390 align:middle line:84%
I said, yeah, I
identify with this.

00:04:13.390 --> 00:04:15.200 align:middle line:90%
And here's the sarcophagus.

00:04:15.200 --> 00:04:17.680 align:middle line:90%
It was in the museum in Cairo.

00:04:17.680 --> 00:04:20.500 align:middle line:84%
It's now in the Grand Egyptian
Museum, which hopefully they're

00:04:20.500 --> 00:04:23.210 align:middle line:84%
going to open sometime
in my lifetime.

00:04:23.210 --> 00:04:25.790 align:middle line:84%
And what the
sarcophagus portrays

00:04:25.790 --> 00:04:29.820 align:middle line:84%
is a depiction of the
Egyptian goddess Nut.

00:04:29.820 --> 00:04:31.770 align:middle line:90%
Her body is filled with stars.

00:04:31.770 --> 00:04:35.090 align:middle line:84%
She symbolizes the Milky Way
because the ancient Egyptians

00:04:35.090 --> 00:04:38.990 align:middle line:84%
believed our whole life was
about our transfiguration

00:04:38.990 --> 00:04:41.690 align:middle line:84%
into star beings
or star walkers,

00:04:41.690 --> 00:04:45.240 align:middle line:84%
so that then we can travel the
waterways of the Milky Way.

00:04:45.240 --> 00:04:47.780 align:middle line:84%
And all of ancient
Egypt was a mirror image

00:04:47.780 --> 00:04:49.890 align:middle line:90%
of the celestial realms.

00:04:49.890 --> 00:04:52.790 align:middle line:84%
The temples are arranged
so that they're essentially

00:04:52.790 --> 00:04:55.440 align:middle line:84%
conduits or stargates
to these higher realms.

00:04:55.440 --> 00:05:00.530 align:middle line:84%
So for years, I had been trying
to get a photo of this guy

00:05:00.530 --> 00:05:03.300 align:middle line:90%
up here on this boat.

00:05:03.300 --> 00:05:04.590 align:middle line:90%
So there he is up there.

00:05:04.590 --> 00:05:06.060 align:middle line:90%
That's our star walker.

00:05:06.060 --> 00:05:08.960 align:middle line:90%
And she says, that's you.

00:05:08.960 --> 00:05:11.850 align:middle line:84%
And I said, yeah, I
identify with that.

00:05:11.850 --> 00:05:14.280 align:middle line:84%
I've spent my whole life
studying these star walkers.

00:05:14.280 --> 00:05:16.640 align:middle line:10%
She said, no, that's you.

00:05:16.640 --> 00:05:19.490 align:middle line:84%
And it just seared
right into my soul

00:05:19.490 --> 00:05:25.310 align:middle line:84%
that, yeah, I am a star
walker and so are you.

00:05:25.310 --> 00:05:26.900 align:middle line:90%
None of us came from here.

00:05:26.900 --> 00:05:28.970 align:middle line:90%
Where did you come from?

00:05:28.970 --> 00:05:31.250 align:middle line:90%
And what are you doing here?

00:05:31.250 --> 00:05:36.120 align:middle line:84%
And when it's time for you
to go, where are you going?

00:05:36.120 --> 00:05:39.360 align:middle line:84%
And how are you
going to get there?

00:05:39.360 --> 00:05:42.040 align:middle line:84%
I'd like to say that we
all have vacation plans.

00:05:42.040 --> 00:05:43.000 align:middle line:90%
We have holiday plans.

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:44.740 align:middle line:84%
We have plans to come
to this conference.

00:05:44.740 --> 00:05:46.210 align:middle line:90%
We have retirement plans.

00:05:46.210 --> 00:05:48.730 align:middle line:90%
But what is your ascension plan?

00:05:48.730 --> 00:05:53.610 align:middle line:84%
What is your soul's plan for
fulfilling your destiny, while

00:05:53.610 --> 00:05:54.907 align:middle line:90%
in the body here?

00:05:54.907 --> 00:05:56.740 align:middle line:84%
And what are you going
to do with this body?

00:05:56.740 --> 00:05:58.157 align:middle line:84%
Are you going to
take it with you?

00:05:58.157 --> 00:06:00.850 align:middle line:84%
That's a possibility
that while living,

00:06:00.850 --> 00:06:03.960 align:middle line:84%
we can transfigure our
bodies into a higher form

00:06:03.960 --> 00:06:05.740 align:middle line:90%
and go somewhere else.

00:06:05.740 --> 00:06:08.890 align:middle line:84%
Or maybe there's a different
way that we're going to travel.

00:06:08.890 --> 00:06:12.630 align:middle line:84%
And these are the questions that
have preoccupied my research,

00:06:12.630 --> 00:06:15.040 align:middle line:90%
as I say, for decades now.

00:06:15.040 --> 00:06:16.830 align:middle line:84%
And this visionary
experience just

00:06:16.830 --> 00:06:19.540 align:middle line:90%
suddenly clicked it into place.

00:06:19.540 --> 00:06:22.153 align:middle line:84%
And she gave me
this instruction.

00:06:22.153 --> 00:06:24.070 align:middle line:84%
I feel like it might
have been Isis or Hathor.

00:06:24.070 --> 00:06:25.560 align:middle line:90%
I can't say for sure.

00:06:25.560 --> 00:06:28.390 align:middle line:84%
But I'm in the Temple
of Hathor, clearly.

00:06:28.390 --> 00:06:31.020 align:middle line:84%
And she's the goddess of love
and joy/ and I'm presuming

00:06:31.020 --> 00:06:34.900 align:middle line:84%
I'm getting some kind of a
download from her, if you will.

00:06:34.900 --> 00:06:37.750 align:middle line:84%
And she's like, no,
this is your logo.

00:06:37.750 --> 00:06:40.070 align:middle line:84%
And you need to put
it on everything.

00:06:40.070 --> 00:06:43.930 align:middle line:84%
And just as the original
Starbucks logo was a mermaid,

00:06:43.930 --> 00:06:46.720 align:middle line:84%
she's like, put that across
the street from Starbucks

00:06:46.720 --> 00:06:48.140 align:middle line:90%
everywhere around the world.

00:06:48.140 --> 00:06:49.490 align:middle line:90%
And I'm like, really?

00:06:49.490 --> 00:06:52.390 align:middle line:84%
I'm just a little investigative
mythologist author.

00:06:52.390 --> 00:06:53.960 align:middle line:90%
How am I going to do that?

00:06:53.960 --> 00:06:54.920 align:middle line:90%
I'll help you.

00:06:54.920 --> 00:06:55.720 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:06:55.720 --> 00:06:56.900 align:middle line:90%
So I'm on.

00:06:56.900 --> 00:06:59.420 align:middle line:90%
And so I had my logo made.

00:06:59.420 --> 00:07:01.160 align:middle line:90%
And now, we're off and running.

00:07:01.160 --> 00:07:04.810 align:middle line:84%
So with that in mind, I want to
take you on a bit of a journey

00:07:04.810 --> 00:07:07.300 align:middle line:84%
through some of this
ancient Egyptian imagery,

00:07:07.300 --> 00:07:11.050 align:middle line:84%
and then into other
traditional concepts about soul

00:07:11.050 --> 00:07:12.560 align:middle line:90%
transfiguration.

00:07:12.560 --> 00:07:14.890 align:middle line:10%
As I mentioned a moment ago,
to the ancient Egyptians,

00:07:14.890 --> 00:07:18.950 align:middle line:10%
the earthly Nile was a mirror
image of the heavenly Nile.

00:07:18.950 --> 00:07:21.910 align:middle line:10%
They used expressions
like, as above, so below,

00:07:21.910 --> 00:07:25.240 align:middle line:10%
as within, so without,
because they believed

00:07:25.240 --> 00:07:28.900 align:middle line:10%
they were intimately connected
with the stars, and, of course,

00:07:28.900 --> 00:07:30.205 align:middle line:10%
the star beings.

00:07:30.205 --> 00:07:33.620 align:middle line:84%
They are out there, but
they're also in here.

00:07:33.620 --> 00:07:37.190 align:middle line:84%
You and I are a
manifestation of stars.

00:07:37.190 --> 00:07:39.940 align:middle line:10%
Every atom, every
cell of our body

00:07:39.940 --> 00:07:43.040 align:middle line:10%
is regenerated or
reconstituted star matter.

00:07:43.040 --> 00:07:46.885 align:middle line:10%
A star exploded to
create all the matter

00:07:46.885 --> 00:07:49.240 align:middle line:10%
that you and I
enjoy in this matrix

00:07:49.240 --> 00:07:51.080 align:middle line:10%
that we live in presently.

00:07:51.080 --> 00:07:53.200 align:middle line:10%
And one day, the
ancient Egyptians said,

00:07:53.200 --> 00:07:57.970 align:middle line:10%
we too will become stars once
again and live in the night sky

00:07:57.970 --> 00:07:59.385 align:middle line:10%
forever as star beings.

00:07:59.385 --> 00:08:00.760 align:middle line:10%
In fact, they
would say that when

00:08:00.760 --> 00:08:03.700 align:middle line:10%
you looked out into the
night sky and saw the stars,

00:08:03.700 --> 00:08:05.360 align:middle line:10%
those are souls.

00:08:05.360 --> 00:08:08.470 align:middle line:84%
Those are souls
that have completed

00:08:08.470 --> 00:08:10.720 align:middle line:84%
their earthly
adventure, and, now,

00:08:10.720 --> 00:08:13.250 align:middle line:84%
have returned to their
original heavenly domain.

00:08:13.250 --> 00:08:16.330 align:middle line:10%
And I know that sounds
absolutely way out there,

00:08:16.330 --> 00:08:20.000 align:middle line:10%
really nuts, that you and I
are, actually, star stuff.

00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:22.400 align:middle line:84%
We are, as Joni Mitchell
said, we are stardust.

00:08:22.400 --> 00:08:23.240 align:middle line:90%
We are golden.

00:08:23.240 --> 00:08:25.300 align:middle line:90%
All of that's true.

00:08:25.300 --> 00:08:29.360 align:middle line:84%
What has to happen is we have to
expand our view of who we are.

00:08:29.360 --> 00:08:32.780 align:middle line:84%
And that is part of the whole
transfiguration process.

00:08:32.780 --> 00:08:35.289 align:middle line:84%
Transfiguration means
to metamorphose,

00:08:35.289 --> 00:08:36.799 align:middle line:90%
to change our form.

00:08:36.799 --> 00:08:42.549 align:middle line:84%
You and I identify with this 3D
physical flesh and blood body.

00:08:42.549 --> 00:08:45.440 align:middle line:84%
But deep within it
is another being,

00:08:45.440 --> 00:08:48.990 align:middle line:84%
very much like the caterpillar
morphing into the butterfly.

00:08:48.990 --> 00:08:52.820 align:middle line:10%
And we identify with our
three-dimensional selves.

00:08:52.820 --> 00:08:56.210 align:middle line:84%
And less, we identify
with our true selves,

00:08:56.210 --> 00:08:59.990 align:middle line:84%
our magnificent selves, just
like that enormous temple

00:08:59.990 --> 00:09:02.210 align:middle line:84%
I had in that
visionary experience

00:09:02.210 --> 00:09:05.280 align:middle line:84%
is so much more magnificent
than the earthly version.

00:09:05.280 --> 00:09:07.710 align:middle line:84%
It's the same thing with the
earthly version of ourselves.

00:09:07.710 --> 00:09:09.530 align:middle line:84%
You and I have a
part of ourselves

00:09:09.530 --> 00:09:12.830 align:middle line:84%
that is already completed this
process that is guiding you

00:09:12.830 --> 00:09:14.840 align:middle line:84%
at this very moment
that is saying,

00:09:14.840 --> 00:09:18.300 align:middle line:84%
hey, guys, William,
everyone here,

00:09:18.300 --> 00:09:22.200 align:middle line:84%
you are so much more than you
are allowing yourself to be.

00:09:22.200 --> 00:09:26.270 align:middle line:84%
And part of what we have to
do is take the blinkers off,

00:09:26.270 --> 00:09:31.050 align:middle line:84%
take the brakes off, allow more
of our true selves to emerge.

00:09:31.050 --> 00:09:34.400 align:middle line:10%
So within the ancient
Egyptian tradition,

00:09:34.400 --> 00:09:38.210 align:middle line:10%
they are attempting
throughout their lifetime

00:09:38.210 --> 00:09:40.520 align:middle line:10%
to connect with the
stars and actually

00:09:40.520 --> 00:09:42.870 align:middle line:10%
to learn to travel the stars.

00:09:42.870 --> 00:09:45.810 align:middle line:84%
Now, when we speak of
traveling the stars today,

00:09:45.810 --> 00:09:50.130 align:middle line:84%
we think of spaceships, we
think of UFOs, something

00:09:50.130 --> 00:09:53.820 align:middle line:84%
like you might see out
at Area 51 or something

00:09:53.820 --> 00:09:57.790 align:middle line:84%
like maybe is on the drawing
boards of various corporations.

00:09:57.790 --> 00:09:59.640 align:middle line:10%
Metallic circular
disks typically

00:09:59.640 --> 00:10:01.960 align:middle line:10%
are giant generation starships.

00:10:01.960 --> 00:10:05.370 align:middle line:10%
But something that I've learned
is that there's another way

00:10:05.370 --> 00:10:06.610 align:middle line:10%
to travel the stars.

00:10:06.610 --> 00:10:08.220 align:middle line:84%
In fact, there's
really only two ways

00:10:08.220 --> 00:10:09.660 align:middle line:90%
that we can travel the stars.

00:10:09.660 --> 00:10:12.810 align:middle line:84%
As Paul said in Corinthians,
flesh and blood cannot inherit

00:10:12.810 --> 00:10:13.960 align:middle line:90%
the kingdom of heaven.

00:10:13.960 --> 00:10:15.160 align:middle line:90%
NASA knows this.

00:10:15.160 --> 00:10:17.850 align:middle line:10%
They've known it since 1962
that our flesh and blood

00:10:17.850 --> 00:10:20.670 align:middle line:10%
bodies are too fragile
to go live on the moon

00:10:20.670 --> 00:10:25.120 align:middle line:10%
or go travel in the stars
for decades or longer.

00:10:25.120 --> 00:10:27.250 align:middle line:10%
It's lonely up there for humans.

00:10:27.250 --> 00:10:28.750 align:middle line:90%
There's radiation.

00:10:28.750 --> 00:10:30.630 align:middle line:84%
There's all kinds
of-- pooping in a tube

00:10:30.630 --> 00:10:33.450 align:middle line:84%
for the rest of your life
is not very appealing,

00:10:33.450 --> 00:10:34.450 align:middle line:90%
things like that.

00:10:34.450 --> 00:10:37.120 align:middle line:84%
So they said, OK, we got
to do something here.

00:10:37.120 --> 00:10:40.660 align:middle line:84%
So in 1962, NASA
coined the word cyborg.

00:10:40.660 --> 00:10:42.720 align:middle line:84%
It says, we're going
to migrate into space,

00:10:42.720 --> 00:10:46.230 align:middle line:84%
we're going to move to Mars or
some of these other Kepler type

00:10:46.230 --> 00:10:49.780 align:middle line:84%
planets, but we're not going to
go as flesh and blood beings.

00:10:49.780 --> 00:10:51.490 align:middle line:90%
We're going to go as robots.

00:10:51.490 --> 00:10:53.970 align:middle line:10%
Hence, for the past
60 years, 50 years,

00:10:53.970 --> 00:10:56.700 align:middle line:10%
we've had this movement
towards transhumanism

00:10:56.700 --> 00:11:00.480 align:middle line:10%
and our merger with AI
and digital technology

00:11:00.480 --> 00:11:02.860 align:middle line:10%
so that we can go
migrate into space.

00:11:02.860 --> 00:11:05.250 align:middle line:10%
That is not very
appealing to me.

00:11:05.250 --> 00:11:08.920 align:middle line:10%
In fact, I'm quite resistant
to that whole concept.

00:11:08.920 --> 00:11:12.030 align:middle line:10%
I'm more open to the
idea that we can travel

00:11:12.030 --> 00:11:14.710 align:middle line:10%
the stars as light beings.

00:11:14.710 --> 00:11:17.310 align:middle line:10%
And what I see in
ancient civilization

00:11:17.310 --> 00:11:20.460 align:middle line:10%
after ancient civilization is
documentation on temple walls

00:11:20.460 --> 00:11:24.180 align:middle line:10%
and in texts that
our body is literally

00:11:24.180 --> 00:11:27.540 align:middle line:10%
a vehicle for our soul.

00:11:27.540 --> 00:11:29.700 align:middle line:10%
You can think of it as
a stairway to heaven.

00:11:29.700 --> 00:11:33.460 align:middle line:10%
If we learn how to operate
this body correctly,

00:11:33.460 --> 00:11:36.490 align:middle line:10%
we can transmute it
into a higher form,

00:11:36.490 --> 00:11:40.000 align:middle line:10%
dissolving ourselves
into information light

00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:44.020 align:middle line:10%
and then reconstituting
ourselves at another planet,

00:11:44.020 --> 00:11:44.980 align:middle line:10%
like that.

00:11:44.980 --> 00:11:47.200 align:middle line:10%
No spaceship required.

00:11:47.200 --> 00:11:49.760 align:middle line:10%
That journey is much
more appealing to me.

00:11:49.760 --> 00:11:52.400 align:middle line:10%
And I'm going to talk with
you about that as we continue.

00:11:52.400 --> 00:11:55.990 align:middle line:10%
So this is the foundation of
the ancient Egyptian idea.

00:11:55.990 --> 00:11:59.720 align:middle line:10%
They weren't talking about
starships and spaceships.

00:11:59.720 --> 00:12:02.590 align:middle line:10%
They were talking about
the human body traveling

00:12:02.590 --> 00:12:05.120 align:middle line:10%
through portals and stargates.

00:12:05.120 --> 00:12:08.180 align:middle line:10%
The oldest religious texts in
the world are the pyramid texts.

00:12:08.180 --> 00:12:10.240 align:middle line:10%
They're located at Saqqara.

00:12:10.240 --> 00:12:13.750 align:middle line:10%
They are replete
with descriptions

00:12:13.750 --> 00:12:17.380 align:middle line:10%
we called utterances,
things like the pharaoh

00:12:17.380 --> 00:12:18.800 align:middle line:10%
scaled the ladder to heaven.

00:12:18.800 --> 00:12:20.600 align:middle line:10%
The pharaoh became
like lightning.

00:12:20.600 --> 00:12:23.270 align:middle line:10%
The pharaoh opened the
portal to the gods.

00:12:23.270 --> 00:12:25.510 align:middle line:10%
The pharaoh now lives with
the gods in the dimension

00:12:25.510 --> 00:12:26.400 align:middle line:10%
of the blessed.

00:12:26.400 --> 00:12:30.170 align:middle line:10%
So they are mapping out this
journey that we're all on.

00:12:30.170 --> 00:12:32.240 align:middle line:10%
And that journey is twofold.

00:12:32.240 --> 00:12:34.570 align:middle line:10%
It's both into the
Milky Way itself,

00:12:34.570 --> 00:12:38.080 align:middle line:10%
into outer space,
traveling to other planets,

00:12:38.080 --> 00:12:41.510 align:middle line:10%
especially the Egyptians
were highly focused on Sirius

00:12:41.510 --> 00:12:46.520 align:middle line:10%
and Orion as places of
domicile for other souls

00:12:46.520 --> 00:12:49.190 align:middle line:10%
and even reconstituted
human beings.

00:12:49.190 --> 00:12:52.500 align:middle line:90%
Or it's a journey into the mind.

00:12:52.500 --> 00:12:55.090 align:middle line:84%
It's a journey into
other dimensions.

00:12:55.090 --> 00:12:58.130 align:middle line:84%
In both instances, they
described the Milky Way

00:12:58.130 --> 00:13:01.200 align:middle line:84%
as the goddess Nut,
her body full of stars.

00:13:01.200 --> 00:13:03.980 align:middle line:84%
So in this example, you
see the Milky Way arcing

00:13:03.980 --> 00:13:04.880 align:middle line:90%
over a desert scene.

00:13:04.880 --> 00:13:06.380 align:middle line:84%
And this is something
you might even

00:13:06.380 --> 00:13:08.760 align:middle line:84%
be able to see from
here in Nevada.

00:13:08.760 --> 00:13:10.700 align:middle line:10%
And here's how the
Egyptians portrayed

00:13:10.700 --> 00:13:14.910 align:middle line:10%
Nut, the Milky Way being
upheld by a God named Geb.

00:13:14.910 --> 00:13:19.340 align:middle line:84%
They believed that
through their meditations,

00:13:19.340 --> 00:13:21.890 align:middle line:84%
through their use of
oils, through their use

00:13:21.890 --> 00:13:24.410 align:middle line:84%
of other spiritual
technologies, that they

00:13:24.410 --> 00:13:27.170 align:middle line:84%
could transmute their
body into a higher form

00:13:27.170 --> 00:13:31.110 align:middle line:84%
and sail upon the
Milky way for eternity.

00:13:31.110 --> 00:13:33.122 align:middle line:84%
And that has a lot
of appeal to me.

00:13:33.122 --> 00:13:34.580 align:middle line:84%
Nothing wrong with
living on Earth,

00:13:34.580 --> 00:13:37.032 align:middle line:90%
but there's so much out there.

00:13:37.032 --> 00:13:38.990 align:middle line:84%
You and I, when we look
out into the night sky,

00:13:38.990 --> 00:13:43.580 align:middle line:84%
we see just a tiny, tiny, tiny
sliver of our entire Milky Way

00:13:43.580 --> 00:13:44.610 align:middle line:90%
galaxy.

00:13:44.610 --> 00:13:48.530 align:middle line:84%
And there are billions of
galaxies similar to our own

00:13:48.530 --> 00:13:50.220 align:middle line:90%
in the known universe.

00:13:50.220 --> 00:13:52.370 align:middle line:84%
And this is what the
Egyptians had tapped into.

00:13:52.370 --> 00:13:53.550 align:middle line:90%
It's this knowledge.

00:13:53.550 --> 00:13:58.680 align:middle line:84%
This is a capstone for a
pyramid over near Dahshur.

00:13:58.680 --> 00:14:00.360 align:middle line:84%
And here, we see
the star walker.

00:14:00.360 --> 00:14:01.980 align:middle line:90%
He's got his Resurrection stick.

00:14:01.980 --> 00:14:05.240 align:middle line:84%
He's on his Ark of the Millions
of Years or Ship of Eternity.

00:14:05.240 --> 00:14:06.840 align:middle line:90%
He's good to go.

00:14:06.840 --> 00:14:11.250 align:middle line:84%
He's ready to star walk to Orion
or Sirius or anywhere else.

00:14:11.250 --> 00:14:13.220 align:middle line:84%
And in their descriptions,
they say, yeah,

00:14:13.220 --> 00:14:14.860 align:middle line:84%
once you get to Orion,
you hang a left,

00:14:14.860 --> 00:14:17.360 align:middle line:84%
you cross over the bridge, you
go to the center of the Milky

00:14:17.360 --> 00:14:18.270 align:middle line:90%
Way galaxy.

00:14:18.270 --> 00:14:19.280 align:middle line:90%
It's so easy.

00:14:19.280 --> 00:14:21.390 align:middle line:84%
They've mapped this
all out for us.

00:14:21.390 --> 00:14:24.470 align:middle line:10%
And all we have to do is just
open up our hearts and minds

00:14:24.470 --> 00:14:28.710 align:middle line:10%
to say, yeah, I'm going
to move in that direction.

00:14:28.710 --> 00:14:30.173 align:middle line:10%
And now, don't worry.

00:14:30.173 --> 00:14:32.840 align:middle line:84%
Some people think they're going
to come to a William Henry talk,

00:14:32.840 --> 00:14:34.215 align:middle line:84%
and I'm going to
try and turn you

00:14:34.215 --> 00:14:36.380 align:middle line:84%
into light in an hour
and a half or so.

00:14:36.380 --> 00:14:37.800 align:middle line:90%
We're not going to do that.

00:14:37.800 --> 00:14:40.640 align:middle line:10%
All I'm trying to do is move
the needle a little bit,

00:14:40.640 --> 00:14:43.400 align:middle line:10%
open the mind, open the
heart to these possibilities,

00:14:43.400 --> 00:14:47.060 align:middle line:10%
and help you to recognize that
the incredible divinity that's

00:14:47.060 --> 00:14:52.100 align:middle line:10%
within you and also the
tremendous abilities that

00:14:52.100 --> 00:14:54.230 align:middle line:10%
are encoded within our bodies.

00:14:54.230 --> 00:14:56.990 align:middle line:10%
This scene here is
from the temple of--

00:14:56.990 --> 00:15:00.110 align:middle line:10%
excuse me, the Tomb of King
Seti in the Valley of the Kings,

00:15:00.110 --> 00:15:03.840 align:middle line:10%
where we see Isis
standing to the left.

00:15:03.840 --> 00:15:07.820 align:middle line:10%
And to her right is
our star walker again.

00:15:07.820 --> 00:15:09.110 align:middle line:10%
He's called Orion.

00:15:09.110 --> 00:15:13.200 align:middle line:10%
And he is, once again, walking
on the ship of eternity.

00:15:13.200 --> 00:15:15.170 align:middle line:10%
And he's got the
star in his hand,

00:15:15.170 --> 00:15:18.080 align:middle line:10%
along with his
resurrection stick.

00:15:18.080 --> 00:15:18.980 align:middle line:90%
It was really funny.

00:15:18.980 --> 00:15:23.630 align:middle line:84%
On my last tour of Egypt,
which was just a few weeks ago,

00:15:23.630 --> 00:15:27.170 align:middle line:84%
my guests started
calling me Captain Orion.

00:15:27.170 --> 00:15:29.040 align:middle line:10%
And I'm like, oh no.

00:15:29.040 --> 00:15:30.540 align:middle line:10%
I'm not going to
live this one down.

00:15:30.540 --> 00:15:31.665 align:middle line:10%
And it's all over Facebook.

00:15:31.665 --> 00:15:34.220 align:middle line:10%
Captain Orion, Captain
Orion, because I'm

00:15:34.220 --> 00:15:37.370 align:middle line:10%
all about these star boats
and wanting to get that

00:15:37.370 --> 00:15:39.000 align:middle line:10%
into our consciousness here.

00:15:39.000 --> 00:15:41.420 align:middle line:10%
It's absolutely
vital at this time.

00:15:41.420 --> 00:15:45.470 align:middle line:84%
Going forward, this is
a beautiful painting.

00:15:45.470 --> 00:15:50.190 align:middle line:84%
My Soul is an Enchanted Boat
is the name of the painting.

00:15:50.190 --> 00:15:52.170 align:middle line:90%
And we see a female.

00:15:52.170 --> 00:15:54.060 align:middle line:90%
She's got her wings on.

00:15:54.060 --> 00:15:57.050 align:middle line:84%
This is a soul who has
completed her earthly cycle

00:15:57.050 --> 00:15:58.400 align:middle line:90%
of incarnation.

00:15:58.400 --> 00:16:01.910 align:middle line:84%
And now, she's sailing
along the waterways, which

00:16:01.910 --> 00:16:04.320 align:middle line:90%
are the celestial waterways.

00:16:04.320 --> 00:16:07.760 align:middle line:84%
And she's, obviously,
been inspired

00:16:07.760 --> 00:16:10.710 align:middle line:84%
by the ancient Egyptian
imagery of the star boats.

00:16:10.710 --> 00:16:16.160 align:middle line:84%
Same thing here in this
painting by John Cole, where

00:16:16.160 --> 00:16:21.620 align:middle line:84%
we see a soul incarnating from
a higher realm with its guardian

00:16:21.620 --> 00:16:24.720 align:middle line:84%
angel riding upon
this boat with it.

00:16:24.720 --> 00:16:27.800 align:middle line:84%
So you see the baby soul
on the boat, the angel.

00:16:27.800 --> 00:16:29.300 align:middle line:84%
And at the front
of the boat, you've

00:16:29.300 --> 00:16:32.240 align:middle line:84%
got another angel
holding an hourglass that

00:16:32.240 --> 00:16:36.930 align:middle line:84%
symbolizes the soul's
incarnation into materiality.

00:16:36.930 --> 00:16:42.500 align:middle line:84%
So this is a beautiful rendition
of the ancient Egyptian concept

00:16:42.500 --> 00:16:43.680 align:middle line:90%
of two things.

00:16:43.680 --> 00:16:46.970 align:middle line:84%
One, that our soul really
is this enchanted boat,

00:16:46.970 --> 00:16:48.770 align:middle line:84%
this Ark of the
Millions of Years,

00:16:48.770 --> 00:16:50.790 align:middle line:84%
and that we have
higher guidance.

00:16:50.790 --> 00:16:54.740 align:middle line:84%
But as Cole presents
here and shows to us,

00:16:54.740 --> 00:16:57.440 align:middle line:84%
something happens to
us all metaphysically.

00:16:57.440 --> 00:17:00.110 align:middle line:84%
And this is described in
numerous spiritual traditions.

00:17:00.110 --> 00:17:03.410 align:middle line:10%
And that is we forget
about our true selves,

00:17:03.410 --> 00:17:05.599 align:middle line:10%
we forget about
our angelic self,

00:17:05.599 --> 00:17:08.869 align:middle line:10%
we forget about our
true capabilities within

00:17:08.869 --> 00:17:12.020 align:middle line:10%
because we've entered into
this world of materiality

00:17:12.020 --> 00:17:15.960 align:middle line:10%
in of time in order to have
this earthly experience.

00:17:15.960 --> 00:17:19.204 align:middle line:10%
Whatever the reason is that
you chose to incarnate,

00:17:19.204 --> 00:17:21.079 align:middle line:10%
whether it's because
you wanted to experience

00:17:21.079 --> 00:17:24.859 align:middle line:10%
chocolate or, experience
Vegas, have sex,

00:17:24.859 --> 00:17:26.420 align:middle line:10%
these are the typical
kinds of things

00:17:26.420 --> 00:17:28.850 align:middle line:10%
that are mentioned
throughout the ancient texts

00:17:28.850 --> 00:17:31.550 align:middle line:10%
for the reasons why these
angelic beings, you and I,

00:17:31.550 --> 00:17:33.140 align:middle line:10%
would incarnate on Earth.

00:17:33.140 --> 00:17:34.740 align:middle line:90%
Work out karma.

00:17:34.740 --> 00:17:37.910 align:middle line:84%
We're agents of
love, of our creator.

00:17:37.910 --> 00:17:40.770 align:middle line:84%
As many of you stars are
in this room right now,

00:17:40.770 --> 00:17:42.980 align:middle line:84%
there are reasons
for incarnating.

00:17:42.980 --> 00:17:47.250 align:middle line:84%
But all of us, I think, would
agree that we have, in a way,

00:17:47.250 --> 00:17:49.600 align:middle line:90%
forgotten about our true selves.

00:17:49.600 --> 00:17:51.130 align:middle line:84%
And that's the
quest that we're on.

00:17:51.130 --> 00:17:52.570 align:middle line:90%
That's why we're here.

00:17:52.570 --> 00:17:57.760 align:middle line:84%
We're looking for those missing
pieces truly of our soul.

00:17:57.760 --> 00:18:00.330 align:middle line:84%
So in Cole's
paintings here, what

00:18:00.330 --> 00:18:03.670 align:middle line:84%
happens is he has a
series of these paintings,

00:18:03.670 --> 00:18:05.980 align:middle line:90%
the boat lands on the shore.

00:18:05.980 --> 00:18:08.910 align:middle line:84%
The soul is now
growing into maturity.

00:18:08.910 --> 00:18:12.690 align:middle line:84%
And the angel is sitting
on the shoreline.

00:18:12.690 --> 00:18:16.500 align:middle line:84%
This is suggestive
or symbolic of us

00:18:16.500 --> 00:18:20.460 align:middle line:84%
departing our original
and true heavenly domain,

00:18:20.460 --> 00:18:25.150 align:middle line:84%
but also forgetting about this
angelic self that is within us.

00:18:25.150 --> 00:18:29.070 align:middle line:84%
And here is Cole's depiction
of the pure land, the kingdom

00:18:29.070 --> 00:18:32.790 align:middle line:84%
of heaven, the higher
dimensional realm,

00:18:32.790 --> 00:18:35.220 align:middle line:84%
the dimension of the blessed,
whatever term you feel

00:18:35.220 --> 00:18:37.150 align:middle line:90%
most comfortable about using.

00:18:37.150 --> 00:18:40.090 align:middle line:84%
It's a beautiful
version of that.

00:18:40.090 --> 00:18:43.830 align:middle line:84%
And all of us have gone
through this process

00:18:43.830 --> 00:18:47.760 align:middle line:84%
here, where we have to, again,
answer these questions that I

00:18:47.760 --> 00:18:49.360 align:middle line:90%
raised just a moment ago.

00:18:49.360 --> 00:18:50.440 align:middle line:90%
Who am I?

00:18:50.440 --> 00:18:51.610 align:middle line:90%
Where did I come from?

00:18:51.610 --> 00:18:52.960 align:middle line:90%
What am I doing here?

00:18:52.960 --> 00:18:57.300 align:middle line:84%
How do I live the best
life while I'm here?

00:18:57.300 --> 00:18:59.860 align:middle line:84%
And where am I
going when I leave?

00:18:59.860 --> 00:19:01.810 align:middle line:90%
And how am I going to get there?

00:19:01.810 --> 00:19:05.100 align:middle line:84%
The good news here is
that spiritual traditions

00:19:05.100 --> 00:19:08.400 align:middle line:84%
for millennia have
pondered these questions

00:19:08.400 --> 00:19:12.040 align:middle line:84%
and have left us
a path to follow.

00:19:12.040 --> 00:19:13.660 align:middle line:10%
And this is the
path of ascension.

00:19:13.660 --> 00:19:16.320 align:middle line:10%
It's the path of the star
walkers, if you will,

00:19:16.320 --> 00:19:17.590 align:middle line:10%
in all traditions.

00:19:17.590 --> 00:19:20.790 align:middle line:10%
It's not a religious
concept, although the concept

00:19:20.790 --> 00:19:23.910 align:middle line:10%
of star walking in ascension
is in all the world's

00:19:23.910 --> 00:19:26.620 align:middle line:10%
religious traditions,
it's often hidden.

00:19:26.620 --> 00:19:29.890 align:middle line:10%
It's not taught to the masses.

00:19:29.890 --> 00:19:31.300 align:middle line:90%
It's esoteric.

00:19:31.300 --> 00:19:33.510 align:middle line:10%
And finding those
pieces, ultimately,

00:19:33.510 --> 00:19:36.930 align:middle line:10%
reveals not a new religion
or a better religion,

00:19:36.930 --> 00:19:39.870 align:middle line:10%
but a true cosmic
teaching that is

00:19:39.870 --> 00:19:42.600 align:middle line:10%
that winds its way
through all the world's

00:19:42.600 --> 00:19:43.780 align:middle line:10%
spiritual traditions.

00:19:43.780 --> 00:19:47.390 align:middle line:10%
And more than ever, with
religious and holy wars

00:19:47.390 --> 00:19:52.590 align:middle line:10%
sparking on our planet right
now, we need a higher vision.

00:19:52.590 --> 00:19:56.660 align:middle line:10%
We need to show those that
are stuck in the material

00:19:56.660 --> 00:19:59.750 align:middle line:10%
realm and the material
concepts that there's a better

00:19:59.750 --> 00:20:03.830 align:middle line:10%
answer by expanding our view
of who we are as human beings

00:20:03.830 --> 00:20:07.160 align:middle line:10%
and removing ourselves,
extricating ourselves

00:20:07.160 --> 00:20:10.490 align:middle line:10%
from this darkness,
and the lack of light

00:20:10.490 --> 00:20:14.260 align:middle line:10%
that we see in some
of these situations.

00:20:14.260 --> 00:20:17.050 align:middle line:84%
As I mentioned a moment
ago, in my research,

00:20:17.050 --> 00:20:21.250 align:middle line:84%
the ancient Egyptians had a
technology, not a technology

00:20:21.250 --> 00:20:24.850 align:middle line:84%
like you'd get at Best Buy,
but a spiritual technology,

00:20:24.850 --> 00:20:28.060 align:middle line:84%
an organic technology
that they would use

00:20:28.060 --> 00:20:32.290 align:middle line:90%
to transmute the physical body.

00:20:32.290 --> 00:20:35.170 align:middle line:10%
They speak of
opening a rusty valve

00:20:35.170 --> 00:20:38.800 align:middle line:10%
in our neurosecretory system,
our pineal and pituitary gland,

00:20:38.800 --> 00:20:41.830 align:middle line:10%
which is profusely illustrated
on the temple walls,

00:20:41.830 --> 00:20:48.130 align:middle line:10%
and how they would use tones,
lights, and plants to awaken

00:20:48.130 --> 00:20:50.980 align:middle line:10%
our neurosecretory
system, to awaken

00:20:50.980 --> 00:20:53.830 align:middle line:10%
what is referred to as
the light body within us

00:20:53.830 --> 00:20:56.890 align:middle line:10%
and literally create
what you can imagine

00:20:56.890 --> 00:21:00.820 align:middle line:10%
is a duplicate of
yourself into which

00:21:00.820 --> 00:21:03.580 align:middle line:10%
your consciousness at the
time of your transition

00:21:03.580 --> 00:21:06.610 align:middle line:10%
can be copied and pasted
into this duplicate version

00:21:06.610 --> 00:21:07.510 align:middle line:10%
of yourself.

00:21:07.510 --> 00:21:09.280 align:middle line:10%
And it is that
version of yourself,

00:21:09.280 --> 00:21:11.170 align:middle line:10%
a non-molecular
version of yourself,

00:21:11.170 --> 00:21:13.180 align:middle line:10%
a non-material
version of yourself

00:21:13.180 --> 00:21:16.660 align:middle line:10%
that will ride upon
these Ships of Eternity

00:21:16.660 --> 00:21:21.430 align:middle line:10%
and then be able to reconstitute
yourself into a physical flesh

00:21:21.430 --> 00:21:25.660 align:middle line:10%
and blood body, if you so
desire, in another world,

00:21:25.660 --> 00:21:29.210 align:middle line:10%
on another planet, perhaps,
even in another dimension.

00:21:29.210 --> 00:21:32.050 align:middle line:10%
That is the great hope
that ancient Egypt

00:21:32.050 --> 00:21:37.490 align:middle line:10%
holds for us in the temple walls
and in all of their traditions.

00:21:37.490 --> 00:21:41.600 align:middle line:10%
And it's something that I
believe we must recover today.

00:21:41.600 --> 00:21:47.130 align:middle line:84%
The reason why is since
while the early 2000s,

00:21:47.130 --> 00:21:51.210 align:middle line:84%
technology people and Silicon
Valley and Beijing and places

00:21:51.210 --> 00:21:54.600 align:middle line:84%
like that have said,
yeah, we also believe

00:21:54.600 --> 00:21:57.300 align:middle line:84%
in the transmutation of the
physical flesh and blood body,

00:21:57.300 --> 00:22:00.030 align:middle line:84%
but we're going to
turn you into a robot.

00:22:00.030 --> 00:22:03.150 align:middle line:84%
And then we're going to copy and
paste the contents of your brain

00:22:03.150 --> 00:22:07.400 align:middle line:84%
into that robot, and that
will be your ascension.

00:22:07.400 --> 00:22:09.780 align:middle line:10%
I'm like, hey, wait a minute.

00:22:09.780 --> 00:22:12.300 align:middle line:10%
You guys got that
a little wrong.

00:22:12.300 --> 00:22:14.080 align:middle line:10%
Wrong might not
be the right word.

00:22:14.080 --> 00:22:15.870 align:middle line:10%
You're a little off.

00:22:15.870 --> 00:22:18.600 align:middle line:84%
That is almost a
mocking or a mimicking

00:22:18.600 --> 00:22:20.950 align:middle line:84%
of all of these ancient
spiritual traditions.

00:22:20.950 --> 00:22:22.630 align:middle line:90%
Yet, this is what we're doing.

00:22:22.630 --> 00:22:24.690 align:middle line:10%
And I've been
studying this, talking

00:22:24.690 --> 00:22:27.340 align:middle line:10%
about it since, again, 2002.

00:22:27.340 --> 00:22:30.060 align:middle line:10%
And back then, they were
warning that by 2035, we

00:22:30.060 --> 00:22:32.190 align:middle line:10%
would turn our
children into machines

00:22:32.190 --> 00:22:34.000 align:middle line:10%
to make trillions of dollars.

00:22:34.000 --> 00:22:35.470 align:middle line:10%
This is the motivation.

00:22:35.470 --> 00:22:41.010 align:middle line:10%
It's a military mission
because most of this tech, AI,

00:22:41.010 --> 00:22:42.870 align:middle line:10%
and the things that
are running our world

00:22:42.870 --> 00:22:45.700 align:middle line:10%
now come out of
military applications

00:22:45.700 --> 00:22:49.000 align:middle line:10%
for military purposes,
strategic purposes.

00:22:49.000 --> 00:22:50.500 align:middle line:10%
It's highly
entertaining to have one

00:22:50.500 --> 00:22:52.042 align:middle line:10%
of these things in
your hand, but you

00:22:52.042 --> 00:22:53.600 align:middle line:10%
don't think of it as a weapon.

00:22:53.600 --> 00:22:55.130 align:middle line:10%
But that's what it is.

00:22:55.130 --> 00:22:56.540 align:middle line:10%
It's a weapon.

00:22:56.540 --> 00:23:01.150 align:middle line:10%
And they've convinced us that
we need this technology to usher

00:23:01.150 --> 00:23:06.170 align:middle line:10%
in a new golden age for all
humankind by the year 2035.

00:23:06.170 --> 00:23:08.680 align:middle line:84%
And I'm like saying,
well, wait a minute.

00:23:08.680 --> 00:23:11.290 align:middle line:84%
You all are talking about
merging the human body

00:23:11.290 --> 00:23:14.750 align:middle line:84%
with bits, with atoms,
with neurons, and genes.

00:23:14.750 --> 00:23:16.840 align:middle line:84%
These are simply
retooled versions

00:23:16.840 --> 00:23:19.810 align:middle line:84%
of what the ancients called
earth, air, fire, and water.

00:23:19.810 --> 00:23:22.270 align:middle line:90%
Hey, where's the spirit?

00:23:22.270 --> 00:23:24.890 align:middle line:90%
Where's the soul in all of this?

00:23:24.890 --> 00:23:28.450 align:middle line:10%
And we're challenged today
because many of your technology

00:23:28.450 --> 00:23:33.820 align:middle line:10%
people don't believe in the old
superstitious folklore concept

00:23:33.820 --> 00:23:37.480 align:middle line:10%
that you're a soul
created by God.

00:23:37.480 --> 00:23:40.270 align:middle line:84%
That's all comic
book stuff to them.

00:23:40.270 --> 00:23:42.020 align:middle line:90%
God is a programmer.

00:23:42.020 --> 00:23:44.000 align:middle line:90%
You live in a simulated reality.

00:23:44.000 --> 00:23:45.950 align:middle line:90%
You live in a movie.

00:23:45.950 --> 00:23:47.810 align:middle line:90%
You're just simply matter.

00:23:47.810 --> 00:23:49.940 align:middle line:90%
And darling, you really don't.

00:23:49.940 --> 00:23:52.240 align:middle line:10%
And what they want
to do is convince you

00:23:52.240 --> 00:23:55.090 align:middle line:10%
that your ascension, which
you really want to do,

00:23:55.090 --> 00:23:57.940 align:middle line:10%
is convert yourself
into a cartoon that

00:23:57.940 --> 00:24:01.960 align:middle line:10%
lives in a black box in
Mark Zuckerberg's backyard.

00:24:01.960 --> 00:24:04.070 align:middle line:10%
And that's your new reality.

00:24:04.070 --> 00:24:05.420 align:middle line:10%
That's your ascension.

00:24:05.420 --> 00:24:09.670 align:middle line:10%
And Elon Musk's promises you
that this new simulated reality,

00:24:09.670 --> 00:24:12.980 align:middle line:10%
they're creating is going to be
so much better than this one.

00:24:12.980 --> 00:24:15.070 align:middle line:10%
You'll never want
to come back here.

00:24:15.070 --> 00:24:19.090 align:middle line:10%
And this is their solution
to climate change.

00:24:19.090 --> 00:24:20.450 align:middle line:90%
So this is what's happening.

00:24:20.450 --> 00:24:22.000 align:middle line:84%
And I look at this, and
I read their papers,

00:24:22.000 --> 00:24:23.417 align:middle line:84%
and listen to what
they're saying.

00:24:23.417 --> 00:24:26.500 align:middle line:84%
I'm like, y'all are like
completely mocking and mimicking

00:24:26.500 --> 00:24:29.440 align:middle line:84%
these ancient spiritual
traditions that tell us that we

00:24:29.440 --> 00:24:31.400 align:middle line:90%
can do this organically.

00:24:31.400 --> 00:24:32.860 align:middle line:90%
We can transfigure.

00:24:32.860 --> 00:24:35.090 align:middle line:90%
And yeah, that is our purpose.

00:24:35.090 --> 00:24:39.580 align:middle line:84%
But you don't need to
pack me full of a new skin

00:24:39.580 --> 00:24:43.450 align:middle line:84%
and nanotechnology in my
brain and replacement organs

00:24:43.450 --> 00:24:46.340 align:middle line:84%
and all this crap that
they're trying to put on us.

00:24:46.340 --> 00:24:47.900 align:middle line:90%
And I'm 61 years old.

00:24:47.900 --> 00:24:49.610 align:middle line:84%
They're not that
interested in me.

00:24:49.610 --> 00:24:51.375 align:middle line:84%
They want our children
and grandchildren.

00:24:51.375 --> 00:24:53.500 align:middle line:10%
That's who they're going
after with this technology

00:24:53.500 --> 00:24:57.920 align:middle line:10%
and promising you'll be able
to live for hundreds of years,

00:24:57.920 --> 00:24:59.710 align:middle line:10%
just give us your soul.

00:24:59.710 --> 00:25:01.660 align:middle line:10%
And your soul is just
all the information

00:25:01.660 --> 00:25:04.330 align:middle line:10%
that you put up on
Facebook, and on Instagram,

00:25:04.330 --> 00:25:06.410 align:middle line:10%
and all these social
media networks.

00:25:06.410 --> 00:25:08.410 align:middle line:10%
And most of us are
clueless that there's

00:25:08.410 --> 00:25:10.460 align:middle line:10%
a grand plan behind this.

00:25:10.460 --> 00:25:14.060 align:middle line:84%
And it's militaristic
at its heart.

00:25:14.060 --> 00:25:18.260 align:middle line:84%
And I'm thinking, we
really got to wake up here.

00:25:18.260 --> 00:25:21.760 align:middle line:84%
We really got to wake up to
our true potential, spiritual

00:25:21.760 --> 00:25:24.490 align:middle line:84%
potential within
us while we still

00:25:24.490 --> 00:25:26.180 align:middle line:90%
have an opportunity to do this.

00:25:26.180 --> 00:25:28.270 align:middle line:10%
And I'm not trying to
come off as all fear-based

00:25:28.270 --> 00:25:29.645 align:middle line:10%
or anything like
that, but I know

00:25:29.645 --> 00:25:31.790 align:middle line:10%
you're hearing those footsteps.

00:25:31.790 --> 00:25:33.880 align:middle line:10%
You're seeing your
children and grandchildren

00:25:33.880 --> 00:25:35.470 align:middle line:10%
coming home from
school saying, yeah,

00:25:35.470 --> 00:25:39.050 align:middle line:10%
my teacher wants me to turn
myself into a cartoon avatar.

00:25:39.050 --> 00:25:41.780 align:middle line:10%
And I can be anything
in this new world.

00:25:41.780 --> 00:25:43.910 align:middle line:10%
And you're going, well,
what are you talking about?

00:25:43.910 --> 00:25:45.820 align:middle line:10%
Well, this is what
they're talking about.

00:25:45.820 --> 00:25:49.090 align:middle line:10%
It's a complete transfiguration
of the human race

00:25:49.090 --> 00:25:51.140 align:middle line:10%
into technological beings.

00:25:51.140 --> 00:25:54.010 align:middle line:84%
And they present us
with ideas like this

00:25:54.010 --> 00:25:55.990 align:middle line:84%
that by 2020, we'd
be able to create

00:25:55.990 --> 00:25:58.000 align:middle line:90%
a robotic copy of ourselves.

00:25:58.000 --> 00:26:02.200 align:middle line:84%
By 2025, an avatar into which
a human brain is transplanted

00:26:02.200 --> 00:26:03.590 align:middle line:90%
at the end of one's life.

00:26:03.590 --> 00:26:06.910 align:middle line:84%
2035, an avatar with
an artificial brain

00:26:06.910 --> 00:26:09.260 align:middle line:84%
in which your personality
is transferred.

00:26:09.260 --> 00:26:12.070 align:middle line:84%
And then, finally, the
ultimate goal is by 2040,

00:26:12.070 --> 00:26:14.620 align:middle line:84%
you'll just drop your
physical body completely.

00:26:14.620 --> 00:26:17.960 align:middle line:84%
And you'll go live as a
cartoon avatar online.

00:26:17.960 --> 00:26:19.690 align:middle line:10%
That's ascension.

00:26:19.690 --> 00:26:23.210 align:middle line:10%
And this is what is being
promoted globally right now.

00:26:23.210 --> 00:26:26.410 align:middle line:10%
World economic forum,
technology people, this

00:26:26.410 --> 00:26:28.190 align:middle line:10%
is their aim right here.

00:26:28.190 --> 00:26:32.140 align:middle line:10%
And I'm saying, nice, clever
use of the word avatar.

00:26:32.140 --> 00:26:35.330 align:middle line:90%
But an avatar is a divine being.

00:26:35.330 --> 00:26:36.800 align:middle line:84%
It's a descent of
a divine being.

00:26:36.800 --> 00:26:39.190 align:middle line:84%
And by utilizing these
terms and these concepts,

00:26:39.190 --> 00:26:43.330 align:middle line:84%
this is a real mocking of
the true spiritual potential

00:26:43.330 --> 00:26:44.450 align:middle line:90%
within us.

00:26:44.450 --> 00:26:46.520 align:middle line:90%
Perhaps, I'm wrong, though.

00:26:46.520 --> 00:26:48.350 align:middle line:10%
Perhaps, there is
a middle ground

00:26:48.350 --> 00:26:51.980 align:middle line:10%
where we can blur ourselves
with this technology

00:26:51.980 --> 00:26:56.410 align:middle line:10%
as they describe, but still
remain a sense of our humanity.

00:26:56.410 --> 00:26:59.630 align:middle line:10%
I'm somewhat open
minded to that concept,

00:26:59.630 --> 00:27:02.780 align:middle line:10%
but I'm pretty dug
in to think we really

00:27:02.780 --> 00:27:05.510 align:middle line:10%
got to be hustling right
now and making sure

00:27:05.510 --> 00:27:07.520 align:middle line:10%
that everybody's on
board with the choice

00:27:07.520 --> 00:27:09.750 align:middle line:10%
that we have before
us at this moment.

00:27:09.750 --> 00:27:13.040 align:middle line:84%
Turn yourself into a
machine, good little machine,

00:27:13.040 --> 00:27:16.250 align:middle line:84%
or turn yourself into
a Christ-like being.

00:27:16.250 --> 00:27:18.740 align:middle line:84%
The resurrection
body, the light body,

00:27:18.740 --> 00:27:21.890 align:middle line:84%
the glory body that Christ
attained in his resurrection

00:27:21.890 --> 00:27:23.990 align:middle line:84%
is the same as the
body of the star

00:27:23.990 --> 00:27:26.060 align:middle line:90%
walker of the ancient Egyptians.

00:27:26.060 --> 00:27:27.440 align:middle line:90%
It's not a Christian teaching.

00:27:27.440 --> 00:27:28.770 align:middle line:10%
It's not Egyptian.

00:27:28.770 --> 00:27:33.110 align:middle line:10%
It is a cosmic teaching that
is now coming down to Earth

00:27:33.110 --> 00:27:35.550 align:middle line:10%
at this very precarious moment.

00:27:35.550 --> 00:27:38.510 align:middle line:84%
And the reason why is because
the human race truly does

00:27:38.510 --> 00:27:39.750 align:middle line:90%
hang in the balance.

00:27:39.750 --> 00:27:42.470 align:middle line:84%
And this decision will be
made in the next five years.

00:27:42.470 --> 00:27:46.260 align:middle line:10%
You and I are the ones that
we'll make it for everyone.

00:27:46.260 --> 00:27:49.600 align:middle line:10%
If you can refer to my book,
"The Skingularity Is Near,"

00:27:49.600 --> 00:27:53.650 align:middle line:10%
I published this online
as a free e-book in 2014.

00:27:53.650 --> 00:27:56.490 align:middle line:10%
I will be updating it as I'm
about to have the 10th year

00:27:56.490 --> 00:28:00.390 align:middle line:10%
anniversary of talking about
some of these concepts about

00:28:00.390 --> 00:28:03.310 align:middle line:10%
the next human and
this technology.

00:28:03.310 --> 00:28:07.270 align:middle line:84%
It's rapidly evolving, but so
is our spiritual capability.

00:28:07.270 --> 00:28:10.460 align:middle line:84%
And let's get back
to that for now.

00:28:10.460 --> 00:28:15.680 align:middle line:84%
In ancient Egypt, they described
this organic transfiguration

00:28:15.680 --> 00:28:19.010 align:middle line:84%
and how they had plants, they
had tones, they had lights,

00:28:19.010 --> 00:28:21.290 align:middle line:84%
and they, ultimately,
were aiming

00:28:21.290 --> 00:28:27.560 align:middle line:84%
at a super biological
process that would take place

00:28:27.560 --> 00:28:30.830 align:middle line:84%
to mature a higher body,
that can transcend a death

00:28:30.830 --> 00:28:33.380 align:middle line:84%
and is capable of furnishing
a sensorium to perceive

00:28:33.380 --> 00:28:35.810 align:middle line:84%
and function in a world
freer than the transient

00:28:35.810 --> 00:28:38.790 align:middle line:84%
three-dimensional one in which
we are currently confined.

00:28:38.790 --> 00:28:41.870 align:middle line:84%
This is the hope,
dream, desire of all

00:28:41.870 --> 00:28:45.620 align:middle line:84%
the world's spiritual traditions
is that we will be able to--

00:28:45.620 --> 00:28:48.770 align:middle line:84%
after our soul has completed
its mission in this realm,

00:28:48.770 --> 00:28:50.460 align:middle line:90%
to transcend it.

00:28:50.460 --> 00:28:54.590 align:middle line:10%
And the idea is, is that
by locking on to this idea

00:28:54.590 --> 00:28:58.040 align:middle line:10%
of transfiguring, metamorphosis,
changing our form,

00:28:58.040 --> 00:29:02.210 align:middle line:10%
or transcendence, it will
bring ideas, inspirations,

00:29:02.210 --> 00:29:06.780 align:middle line:10%
and, indeed, capabilities
into our 3D existence.

00:29:06.780 --> 00:29:09.630 align:middle line:84%
This is the reason why we want
to study these traditions.

00:29:09.630 --> 00:29:12.570 align:middle line:84%
And while you might be sitting
there thinking, well, again,

00:29:12.570 --> 00:29:15.300 align:middle line:84%
I'm like the caterpillar looking
up at the butterfly saying,

00:29:15.300 --> 00:29:17.945 align:middle line:84%
you'll never get me up
in one of those things.

00:29:17.945 --> 00:29:20.410 align:middle line:84%
That's our fundamental,
cultural dilemma.

00:29:20.410 --> 00:29:23.190 align:middle line:10%
And here we are on this
Saturday morning facing that.

00:29:23.190 --> 00:29:24.570 align:middle line:10%
Saying, I just had my coffee.

00:29:24.570 --> 00:29:26.670 align:middle line:10%
And now, he's telling me I got
to turn into a being of light

00:29:26.670 --> 00:29:27.470 align:middle line:10%
or something.

00:29:27.470 --> 00:29:29.590 align:middle line:10%
That's a bit of a stretch
for me this morning.

00:29:29.590 --> 00:29:30.820 align:middle line:10%
I understand that.

00:29:30.820 --> 00:29:33.900 align:middle line:10%
But, again, by moving
into this direction

00:29:33.900 --> 00:29:36.600 align:middle line:10%
and identifying with
this aspect of yourself,

00:29:36.600 --> 00:29:39.600 align:middle line:10%
new ways, new ideas,
new inspirations,

00:29:39.600 --> 00:29:44.020 align:middle line:10%
you can't even conceive, when
you have the blinkers on it--

00:29:44.020 --> 00:29:45.850 align:middle line:10%
I'm not accusing you
of having blinkers on.

00:29:45.850 --> 00:29:49.050 align:middle line:10%
You all are very
much awake people.

00:29:49.050 --> 00:29:51.930 align:middle line:10%
But by even expanding
your vision even more,

00:29:51.930 --> 00:29:53.850 align:middle line:10%
this is where we're
going to get the,

00:29:53.850 --> 00:29:57.060 align:middle line:10%
what I refer to as the
angelic intelligence that

00:29:57.060 --> 00:30:00.100 align:middle line:10%
is going to be the counter
to artificial intelligence.

00:30:00.100 --> 00:30:02.320 align:middle line:10%
It's the counter,
if not the antidote.

00:30:02.320 --> 00:30:06.600 align:middle line:10%
We all have to be thinking
as these transfigured beings.

00:30:06.600 --> 00:30:10.560 align:middle line:10%
We have to put on our angelic
thinking caps at this moment

00:30:10.560 --> 00:30:13.680 align:middle line:10%
and allow new ideas
and inspirations

00:30:13.680 --> 00:30:16.440 align:middle line:10%
to enter into our consciousness
that will, ultimately,
