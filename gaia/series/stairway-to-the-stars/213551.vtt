00:00:11.960 --> 00:00:13.450 align:middle line:90%
>> All right.

00:00:13.450 --> 00:00:18.040 align:middle line:10%
So this is from a very
interesting piece that was

00:00:18.040 --> 00:00:22.280 align:middle line:10%
written way back in 1963, "The
World-Year of the Persians."

00:00:22.280 --> 00:00:25.460 align:middle line:84%
It's published in the Journal of
the American Oriental Society.

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:28.300 align:middle line:84%
"The notion of cyclically
recurrent cosmic disasters,

00:00:28.300 --> 00:00:32.080 align:middle line:84%
a catastrophe by flood
alternating with one by fire--

00:00:32.080 --> 00:00:35.500 align:middle line:84%
has been traced from
ancient Babylonia and Iran

00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:38.020 align:middle line:84%
through Pythagorean
and Stoic philosophy,

00:00:38.020 --> 00:00:43.170 align:middle line:84%
and thence into
the medieval world.

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:45.700 align:middle line:84%
In classical Greek and
Hellenistic literature,

00:00:45.700 --> 00:00:49.020 align:middle line:84%
the doctrine of the 'Great
Year' was already connected with

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:51.980 align:middle line:84%
the myths of the
Deluge and Ekpyrosis."

00:00:51.980 --> 00:00:55.880 align:middle line:84%
Now, Deluge is the destruction
of the world by water.

00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:58.600 align:middle line:10%
Ekpyrosis is the destruction
of the world by fire.

00:00:58.600 --> 00:01:01.200 align:middle line:10%
And you know if
you read the Bible,

00:01:01.200 --> 00:01:02.590 align:middle line:10%
it's almost like bookends.

00:01:02.590 --> 00:01:06.870 align:middle line:10%
You've got the Deluge of Noah
in the recounted beginning.

00:01:06.870 --> 00:01:10.890 align:middle line:10%
It's third through seventh
chapters of Genesis.

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:13.590 align:middle line:10%
And then you've got
the apocalyptic visions

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:16.050 align:middle line:10%
in the book of Revelations,
which is primarily

00:01:16.050 --> 00:01:18.190 align:middle line:10%
describing destruction by fire.

00:01:18.190 --> 00:01:22.920 align:middle line:84%
And those are the two
bookends of the sacred Judeo--

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:24.990 align:middle line:90%
the Christian scriptures.

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:29.460 align:middle line:10%
But those same ideas we find
all over the ancient world.

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:32.820 align:middle line:10%
This was not something
that was limited to one

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:34.630 align:middle line:10%
particular cultural group.

00:01:34.630 --> 00:01:37.500 align:middle line:10%
I think the reason for that
is in a very strong case can

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:40.080 align:middle line:10%
be made is that
yes, there really

00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:43.720 align:middle line:10%
have been tremendous
catastrophes that afflict

00:01:43.720 --> 00:01:45.690 align:middle line:10%
this planet from time to time.

00:01:45.690 --> 00:01:48.490 align:middle line:10%
Our ancestors survived
some of these catastrophes.

00:01:48.490 --> 00:01:53.140 align:middle line:10%
And the catastrophes did
involve gigantic fires

00:01:53.140 --> 00:01:55.020 align:middle line:10%
and gigantic floods.

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:58.240 align:middle line:10%
So we're going to look a little
bit at the floods, first of all,

00:01:58.240 --> 00:02:02.090 align:middle line:10%
but we're going to see this
what I call the wheel of time.

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:05.320 align:middle line:10%
And what I've done
is here is I've

00:02:05.320 --> 00:02:08.780 align:middle line:10%
broken up the wheel into 12.

00:02:08.780 --> 00:02:11.590 align:middle line:84%
And you can see
down here is Leo,

00:02:11.590 --> 00:02:16.520 align:middle line:84%
and right up here would be
the cusp of Pisces, Aquarius.

00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:18.620 align:middle line:90%
So this would be 0 years--

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:20.960 align:middle line:90%
BP stands for Before Present.

00:02:20.960 --> 00:02:26.120 align:middle line:84%
And 25,920 years BP that
would have been one cycle ago.

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:29.050 align:middle line:84%
The vernal equinox would have
been stationed right in here.

00:02:29.050 --> 00:02:32.290 align:middle line:84%
If we go across this
half of a cycle ago,

00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:38.920 align:middle line:84%
12,960 years before present,
we're within a few decades

00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:42.140 align:middle line:84%
of an event that is known
as the Younger Dryas.

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:44.030 align:middle line:84%
How many have you
ever heard that term?

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:46.990 align:middle line:90%
All of you I hope by now.

00:02:46.990 --> 00:02:49.450 align:middle line:10%
There was a time not too
long ago when I said,

00:02:49.450 --> 00:02:51.620 align:middle line:10%
how many have heard
of the Younger Dryas?

00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:52.820 align:middle line:10%
No hands would have gone up.

00:02:52.820 --> 00:02:55.262 align:middle line:10%
So we're making progress here.

00:02:55.262 --> 00:02:58.186 align:middle line:90%
[APPLAUSE]

00:02:58.186 --> 00:02:59.920 align:middle line:90%


00:02:59.920 --> 00:03:02.610 align:middle line:84%
Well, I also have to give
credit to my good friend Graham

00:03:02.610 --> 00:03:03.410 align:middle line:90%
Hancock.

00:03:03.410 --> 00:03:10.460 align:middle line:84%
He has done as much, if not
more, and other researchers

00:03:10.460 --> 00:03:12.990 align:middle line:84%
but maybe not quite as
well known at this time.

00:03:12.990 --> 00:03:15.470 align:middle line:10%
But yes, I have been
very much trying

00:03:15.470 --> 00:03:18.740 align:middle line:10%
to get this insight
about our past history

00:03:18.740 --> 00:03:22.430 align:middle line:10%
out for going on decades now.

00:03:22.430 --> 00:03:25.310 align:middle line:10%
So anyways, if we
go back through,

00:03:25.310 --> 00:03:29.120 align:middle line:10%
like notice here if we
go back 2,160 years ago,

00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:31.700 align:middle line:10%
now we're at the cusp
of Aries, Pisces.

00:03:31.700 --> 00:03:35.570 align:middle line:84%
Go back to that little
further in about 4,320,

00:03:35.570 --> 00:03:38.520 align:middle line:84%
and we're at the cusp
of Taurus, Aries.

00:03:38.520 --> 00:03:43.230 align:middle line:84%
Go back one more, and we're
at 6,480 Before Present.

00:03:43.230 --> 00:03:46.157 align:middle line:84%
Now, here's something
very interesting.

00:03:46.157 --> 00:03:47.240 align:middle line:90%
And I'm going to show you.

00:03:47.240 --> 00:03:49.255 align:middle line:84%
Actually, we'll just
jump to the next slide.

00:03:49.255 --> 00:03:50.630 align:middle line:84%
But, first of all,
I'm just going

00:03:50.630 --> 00:03:52.310 align:middle line:84%
to call your attention
to these numbers

00:03:52.310 --> 00:03:53.840 align:middle line:84%
because these are
numbers that are

00:03:53.840 --> 00:03:56.720 align:middle line:84%
part of the sacred
canon of numerology,

00:03:56.720 --> 00:03:58.020 align:middle line:90%
if you want to call it that.

00:03:58.020 --> 00:04:00.500 align:middle line:84%
These are numbers that we
find over and over again

00:04:00.500 --> 00:04:02.480 align:middle line:84%
in the measurement
of time cycles

00:04:02.480 --> 00:04:05.760 align:middle line:84%
but also in the measurement
of geometric relationships.

00:04:05.760 --> 00:04:07.950 align:middle line:90%
Key numbers.

00:04:07.950 --> 00:04:12.080 align:middle line:84%
So if we go back right
here, 6,480 years ago,

00:04:12.080 --> 00:04:13.350 align:middle line:90%
I'll go to the next slide.

00:04:13.350 --> 00:04:17.510 align:middle line:84%
And what I've done here is
this is a very in-depth going

00:04:17.510 --> 00:04:19.100 align:middle line:84%
through the
scientific literature

00:04:19.100 --> 00:04:22.440 align:middle line:84%
cataloging what would
be catastrophic events.

00:04:22.440 --> 00:04:24.920 align:middle line:84%
My criteria that
I've used is trying

00:04:24.920 --> 00:04:29.450 align:middle line:84%
to discern events which
if they happened today

00:04:29.450 --> 00:04:34.830 align:middle line:84%
would seriously stress if not
eliminate modern civilization.

00:04:34.830 --> 00:04:37.820 align:middle line:10%
So that's the
magnitude of severity

00:04:37.820 --> 00:04:41.430 align:middle line:10%
that I used as my criteria.

00:04:41.430 --> 00:04:42.950 align:middle line:10%
And we can look
at this, and we're

00:04:42.950 --> 00:04:46.850 align:middle line:10%
going to see that there's a lot
of things arrayed around here.

00:04:46.850 --> 00:04:50.210 align:middle line:10%
Interestingly, the axis
that we're on right now

00:04:50.210 --> 00:04:53.600 align:middle line:10%
seems to be the one that's the
most prolifically represented

00:04:53.600 --> 00:04:55.790 align:middle line:10%
by catastrophic events.

00:04:55.790 --> 00:05:00.340 align:middle line:84%
You can see here, like Heinrich
event 5 happened 21,600 years

00:05:00.340 --> 00:05:01.140 align:middle line:90%
ago.

00:05:01.140 --> 00:05:02.050 align:middle line:90%
What was that?

00:05:02.050 --> 00:05:03.890 align:middle line:10%
Well, Heinrich events
are events where--

00:05:03.890 --> 00:05:06.800 align:middle line:90%


00:05:06.800 --> 00:05:08.270 align:middle line:10%
One of the things
that's been going

00:05:08.270 --> 00:05:12.470 align:middle line:10%
on since the beginning
of the Pleistocene epoch,

00:05:12.470 --> 00:05:16.470 align:middle line:10%
which goes back 2.6
million years ago,

00:05:16.470 --> 00:05:20.090 align:middle line:10%
interestingly, when you figure
that, I think maybe 2.6 million.

00:05:20.090 --> 00:05:22.310 align:middle line:10%
Well, that's 2,600,000.

00:05:22.310 --> 00:05:28.280 align:middle line:10%
Maybe it's closer to
2,580,200, something like that

00:05:28.280 --> 00:05:31.790 align:middle line:10%
because it's very, very close
to being like 100 precessional

00:05:31.790 --> 00:05:34.050 align:middle line:10%
cycles, or is it 1,000?

00:05:34.050 --> 00:05:34.890 align:middle line:90%
Doesn't matter.

00:05:34.890 --> 00:05:35.910 align:middle line:90%
You get the point.

00:05:35.910 --> 00:05:39.930 align:middle line:84%
But anyways, what happens
during a Heinrich event?

00:05:39.930 --> 00:05:40.875 align:middle line:90%
Well, if we go back--

00:05:40.875 --> 00:05:43.250 align:middle line:84%
and we're going to be talking
about this in a little more

00:05:43.250 --> 00:05:47.570 align:middle line:84%
depth-- if we go back 15,000
years, 20,000 years ago,

00:05:47.570 --> 00:05:51.380 align:middle line:84%
the world was in the
grip of a great Ice Age.

00:05:51.380 --> 00:05:52.680 align:middle line:90%
Now, what does that mean?

00:05:52.680 --> 00:05:55.097 align:middle line:84%
Well, for one thing, it means
that the average temperature

00:05:55.097 --> 00:05:57.630 align:middle line:84%
of the globe was at least
10 degrees colder than now.

00:05:57.630 --> 00:06:00.290 align:middle line:10%
It also means that there was
more than double the amount

00:06:00.290 --> 00:06:02.760 align:middle line:10%
of glacial ice that we now find.

00:06:02.760 --> 00:06:06.170 align:middle line:10%
Think about this, North
America-- more than half

00:06:06.170 --> 00:06:09.660 align:middle line:10%
of North America had a giant
ice sheet on it as big or bigger

00:06:09.660 --> 00:06:11.890 align:middle line:10%
than the one that now
covers the South Pole.

00:06:11.890 --> 00:06:15.240 align:middle line:10%
It might have been a 1 and a 1/2
to 2 miles thick over its over

00:06:15.240 --> 00:06:17.500 align:middle line:10%
its core over Central Canada.

00:06:17.500 --> 00:06:19.620 align:middle line:10%
It reached from the
Atlantic to the Pacific

00:06:19.620 --> 00:06:24.390 align:middle line:10%
and from the Northern United
States up to the Arctic Circle.

00:06:24.390 --> 00:06:28.540 align:middle line:10%
Northern cities like New York,
Boston, Philadelphia, Detroit,

00:06:28.540 --> 00:06:34.030 align:middle line:10%
Chicago, Milwaukee, The Twin
Cities, Seattle, Portland,

00:06:34.030 --> 00:06:37.360 align:middle line:10%
they were all buried under
thousands of feet of ice.

00:06:37.360 --> 00:06:41.540 align:middle line:10%
Now, in a geological frame,
this is no time at all.

00:06:41.540 --> 00:06:45.620 align:middle line:10%
Now, obviously, there were
people living on the planet

00:06:45.620 --> 00:06:47.070 align:middle line:10%
during that Ice Age.

00:06:47.070 --> 00:06:50.030 align:middle line:84%
And, to this day,
I have challenged

00:06:50.030 --> 00:06:52.940 align:middle line:84%
many proponents of
the climate crisis

00:06:52.940 --> 00:06:55.790 align:middle line:90%
that we're supposedly now in.

00:06:55.790 --> 00:06:58.370 align:middle line:10%
I've challenged them
to explain to me, OK,

00:06:58.370 --> 00:07:00.980 align:middle line:10%
given that the
science is settled

00:07:00.980 --> 00:07:05.780 align:middle line:10%
and there is a consensus about
what drives climate change,

00:07:05.780 --> 00:07:09.020 align:middle line:10%
let's look at some of the
most extreme climate changes

00:07:09.020 --> 00:07:10.230 align:middle line:10%
that we can document.

00:07:10.230 --> 00:07:13.310 align:middle line:10%
And this is the transition
into and out of a glacial age.

00:07:13.310 --> 00:07:15.170 align:middle line:10%
What's going on there?

00:07:15.170 --> 00:07:18.090 align:middle line:10%
Nobody can explain it
because it's still a mystery.

00:07:18.090 --> 00:07:20.720 align:middle line:10%
And the problem is
there were models,

00:07:20.720 --> 00:07:22.380 align:middle line:10%
but how do you get
out of an Ice Age?

00:07:22.380 --> 00:07:26.210 align:middle line:10%
Well, Milenkovic forces,
which are very slow,

00:07:26.210 --> 00:07:29.540 align:middle line:10%
which would require tens
of thousands of years.

00:07:29.540 --> 00:07:33.180 align:middle line:10%
50,000, 60,000, 70,000 years,
those were the old models.

00:07:33.180 --> 00:07:36.800 align:middle line:10%
But now with much improved
dating and precision,

00:07:36.800 --> 00:07:40.550 align:middle line:10%
we can say that, yeah, most of
that ice was gone in three major

00:07:40.550 --> 00:07:44.900 align:middle line:10%
pulses in about 3,000 years.

00:07:44.900 --> 00:07:46.250 align:middle line:10%
How do you explain that?

00:07:46.250 --> 00:07:49.730 align:middle line:10%
In fact, this was realized in
the early '70s by scientists who

00:07:49.730 --> 00:07:53.330 align:middle line:10%
were looking at the rapidity
with which the ice came

00:07:53.330 --> 00:07:56.630 align:middle line:10%
and left, and they ended
up scratching their heads.

00:07:56.630 --> 00:08:01.280 align:middle line:10%
They coined the
term energy paradox.

00:08:01.280 --> 00:08:04.860 align:middle line:10%
Because, obviously, if you've
got 6,000,000 or 7,000,000

00:08:04.860 --> 00:08:07.760 align:middle line:10%
million cubic miles of ice
piled up on the continents,

00:08:07.760 --> 00:08:09.480 align:middle line:10%
there's another
consequence of that.

00:08:09.480 --> 00:08:12.590 align:middle line:10%
One is that that's,
ultimately, seawater

00:08:12.590 --> 00:08:14.630 align:middle line:10%
that's been evaporated
out of the oceans,

00:08:14.630 --> 00:08:17.100 align:middle line:10%
precipitated out, and
then never melted.

00:08:17.100 --> 00:08:19.280 align:middle line:90%
It just piled up as glacial ice.

00:08:19.280 --> 00:08:21.030 align:middle line:90%
Sea levels dropped.

00:08:21.030 --> 00:08:23.480 align:middle line:10%
So during the late
glacial maximum,

00:08:23.480 --> 00:08:26.300 align:middle line:10%
if we go back 14,000
to 20,000 years ago,

00:08:26.300 --> 00:08:30.710 align:middle line:10%
sea levels are 400 feet
lower than now, 400.

00:08:30.710 --> 00:08:32.039 align:middle line:90%
Now, what did that mean?

00:08:32.039 --> 00:08:35.840 align:middle line:84%
Well, what it did was it
exposed the continental shelves

00:08:35.840 --> 00:08:37.909 align:middle line:90%
of every continent on Earth.

00:08:37.909 --> 00:08:42.140 align:middle line:10%
And about as much land was
reclaimed by the dropping

00:08:42.140 --> 00:08:45.900 align:middle line:10%
of sea level as was lost
because it was swallowed up

00:08:45.900 --> 00:08:47.930 align:middle line:10%
under glacial ice.

00:08:47.930 --> 00:08:52.820 align:middle line:10%
Now, during ice ages,
the most benign place

00:08:52.820 --> 00:08:55.130 align:middle line:10%
that you're going to try
to establish a settlement

00:08:55.130 --> 00:09:00.120 align:middle line:10%
or a colony or even a city
would be along coastlines.

00:09:00.120 --> 00:09:02.600 align:middle line:10%
Well, those coastlines are
under 400 feet of water now.

00:09:02.600 --> 00:09:04.713 align:middle line:10%
This is why I say that
the future of archaeology

00:09:04.713 --> 00:09:06.380 align:middle line:10%
is probably going to
be under the oceans

00:09:06.380 --> 00:09:08.630 align:middle line:10%
because we're just beginning
to realize that there was

00:09:08.630 --> 00:09:11.600 align:middle line:10%
a whole lot of stuff going
on those exposed continental

00:09:11.600 --> 00:09:12.530 align:middle line:10%
shelves.

00:09:12.530 --> 00:09:16.010 align:middle line:10%
But now we have this pulse
where the glaciers have grown.

00:09:16.010 --> 00:09:17.090 align:middle line:10%
They've shrunk away.

00:09:17.090 --> 00:09:18.060 align:middle line:10%
Sea level goes down.

00:09:18.060 --> 00:09:18.860 align:middle line:10%
It comes up.

00:09:18.860 --> 00:09:20.110 align:middle line:10%
It goes down, and it comes up.

00:09:20.110 --> 00:09:22.730 align:middle line:10%
And it's probably done this
a couple of dozen times,

00:09:22.730 --> 00:09:26.210 align:middle line:10%
perhaps throughout the course
of the Pleistocene, which,

00:09:26.210 --> 00:09:28.590 align:middle line:10%
like I said, goes back
2.6 million years.

00:09:28.590 --> 00:09:33.180 align:middle line:10%
Now, we have epochs in
geological timekeeping.

00:09:33.180 --> 00:09:36.500 align:middle line:10%
And then the Pleistocene
was an epoch.

00:09:36.500 --> 00:09:39.350 align:middle line:10%
And the Holocene, which is
the period we're in now,

00:09:39.350 --> 00:09:40.880 align:middle line:10%
is also an epoch.

00:09:40.880 --> 00:09:45.890 align:middle line:10%
Well, the current length of the
Holocene is given as 11,600.

00:09:45.890 --> 00:09:48.060 align:middle line:10%
So this raises an
interesting question,

00:09:48.060 --> 00:09:50.880 align:middle line:10%
is the Holocene really
a completely separate

00:09:50.880 --> 00:09:54.000 align:middle line:10%
geological epoch different
from the Pleistocene,

00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:56.880 align:middle line:10%
or is it simply
another variation

00:09:56.880 --> 00:09:58.540 align:middle line:10%
within the Pleistocene itself?

00:09:58.540 --> 00:10:01.800 align:middle line:10%
Now, what characterizes the
Pleistocene from the preceding

00:10:01.800 --> 00:10:06.450 align:middle line:10%
epoch, the Pliocene, is that
there was a major climatic shift

00:10:06.450 --> 00:10:08.940 align:middle line:10%
right at 2.6 million years ago.

00:10:08.940 --> 00:10:12.630 align:middle line:10%
And this is when we begin to see
this oscillation of the planet

00:10:12.630 --> 00:10:14.700 align:middle line:10%
between glacial and
interglacial ages,

00:10:14.700 --> 00:10:16.420 align:middle line:10%
back and forth, back and forth.

00:10:16.420 --> 00:10:18.840 align:middle line:10%
And that's what defines
and distinguishes

00:10:18.840 --> 00:10:22.080 align:middle line:10%
the Pleistocene from the
previous rather steady state

00:10:22.080 --> 00:10:25.100 align:middle line:10%
warm condition of the Pliocene.

00:10:25.100 --> 00:10:28.740 align:middle line:10%
So the question in my mind
is, is the Holocene really

00:10:28.740 --> 00:10:32.130 align:middle line:10%
a distinct geological
epoch, or is it just

00:10:32.130 --> 00:10:36.192 align:middle line:10%
a sub epoch within
the Pleistocene?

00:10:36.192 --> 00:10:37.650 align:middle line:10%
Well, here's the
interesting thing,

00:10:37.650 --> 00:10:43.080 align:middle line:10%
with our high-resolution
reconstructions of climate

00:10:43.080 --> 00:10:45.390 align:middle line:10%
now going back a quarter
of a million years

00:10:45.390 --> 00:10:51.780 align:middle line:10%
based upon ever-improving
dating technologies,

00:10:51.780 --> 00:10:55.410 align:middle line:10%
we can see that within the
last quarter million years,

00:10:55.410 --> 00:10:59.790 align:middle line:10%
there have been maybe four
cycles, glacial, interglacial.

00:10:59.790 --> 00:11:02.460 align:middle line:10%
And the interglacial
like that we're in now,

00:11:02.460 --> 00:11:05.310 align:middle line:10%
the Holocene, when we
look at the duration

00:11:05.310 --> 00:11:07.410 align:middle line:10%
of the previous
ones, we've already

00:11:07.410 --> 00:11:11.400 align:middle line:10%
outlasted the previous ones
by a couple of thousand years.

00:11:11.400 --> 00:11:12.490 align:middle line:10%
What does that mean?

00:11:12.490 --> 00:11:16.020 align:middle line:10%
Well, I don't know, other than
the fact that if the duration

00:11:16.020 --> 00:11:19.710 align:middle line:10%
of an interglacial is
8,000 or 10,000 years,

00:11:19.710 --> 00:11:22.370 align:middle line:10%
we're going on 11,600 years now.

00:11:22.370 --> 00:11:28.080 align:middle line:84%
11,600 years is the date now
given to the transition between

00:11:28.080 --> 00:11:29.790 align:middle line:90%
Pleistocene and Holocene.

00:11:29.790 --> 00:11:33.100 align:middle line:10%
That date to me, it was
always really interesting.

00:11:33.100 --> 00:11:33.900 align:middle line:10%
Why?

00:11:33.900 --> 00:11:38.520 align:middle line:10%
Because even before that
date was honed in on back

00:11:38.520 --> 00:11:41.730 align:middle line:10%
in the '70s when I first started
reading Plato and reading about

00:11:41.730 --> 00:11:46.170 align:middle line:10%
Atlantis, I learned that the
Egyptian priests told Solon that

00:11:46.170 --> 00:11:51.360 align:middle line:10%
Atlantis subsided 9,000 years
before Solon's journey to Egypt,

00:11:51.360 --> 00:11:54.650 align:middle line:10%
which occurred 2,600 years ago.

00:11:54.650 --> 00:11:57.740 align:middle line:10%
So, in other words, Plato
is telling us that something

00:11:57.740 --> 00:12:02.910 align:middle line:10%
happened, a major catastrophe
happened 11,600 years ago.

00:12:02.910 --> 00:12:07.940 align:middle line:10%
And we now know that is the
upper, Younger Dryas boundary.

00:12:07.940 --> 00:12:13.100 align:middle line:10%
The Younger Dryas period lasted
from right at 12,900 to 11,600

00:12:13.100 --> 00:12:15.450 align:middle line:10%
years ago, about 1,300 years.

00:12:15.450 --> 00:12:21.080 align:middle line:10%
And it was associated with what
is called meltwater pulse 1B.

00:12:21.080 --> 00:12:25.040 align:middle line:10%
In other words, marine
geologists and oceanographers

00:12:25.040 --> 00:12:28.700 align:middle line:10%
have identified a point in
time where over very short

00:12:28.700 --> 00:12:32.040 align:middle line:10%
duration sea levels
massively rose.

00:12:32.040 --> 00:12:34.250 align:middle line:10%
In other words, the
rising of the sea levels

00:12:34.250 --> 00:12:37.460 align:middle line:10%
from 400 feet lower
to the present level

00:12:37.460 --> 00:12:39.030 align:middle line:10%
didn't happen smooth.

00:12:39.030 --> 00:12:42.680 align:middle line:10%
It happened in a series of
tremendous, powerful pulses

00:12:42.680 --> 00:12:44.400 align:middle line:10%
of meltwater.

00:12:44.400 --> 00:12:49.020 align:middle line:84%
So this is where I think the
origins of the Great Flood

00:12:49.020 --> 00:12:50.890 align:middle line:90%
myths, ultimately, came from.

00:12:50.890 --> 00:12:53.280 align:middle line:84%
And one of the things
that I would mention

00:12:53.280 --> 00:12:58.020 align:middle line:84%
is that I see that there are
three possible mechanisms

00:12:58.020 --> 00:13:02.380 align:middle line:84%
by which you could produce
catastrophic floods.

00:13:02.380 --> 00:13:09.580 align:middle line:10%
One is the rapidly melting
ice sheets of the glaciers.

00:13:09.580 --> 00:13:13.900 align:middle line:10%
Then you would also have
the corresponding rapid rise

00:13:13.900 --> 00:13:15.160 align:middle line:10%
of sea level.

00:13:15.160 --> 00:13:20.260 align:middle line:84%
The other is that there
would be tremendous prolonged

00:13:20.260 --> 00:13:22.450 align:middle line:90%
torrential rain falls.

00:13:22.450 --> 00:13:25.820 align:middle line:10%
And I'll get into it in a second
what could provoke such a thing.

00:13:25.820 --> 00:13:29.500 align:middle line:10%
And the third is now
the newly emerging

00:13:29.500 --> 00:13:33.310 align:middle line:10%
or consistently emerging new
evidence for gigantic tsunamis

00:13:33.310 --> 00:13:36.040 align:middle line:10%
that have swept over the
coastlines of the planet

00:13:36.040 --> 00:13:37.190 align:middle line:10%
from time to time.

00:13:37.190 --> 00:13:40.492 align:middle line:10%
And I'm talking about tsunamis
that many of you are aware of.

00:13:40.492 --> 00:13:41.950 align:middle line:10%
There are a couple
of tsunamis that

00:13:41.950 --> 00:13:44.320 align:middle line:10%
had happened to
Japan and Indonesia

00:13:44.320 --> 00:13:45.770 align:middle line:10%
in the last few decades.

00:13:45.770 --> 00:13:48.410 align:middle line:10%
I'm talking about tsunamis
that would dwarf those.

00:13:48.410 --> 00:13:50.390 align:middle line:10%
We now know that
those have happened.

00:13:50.390 --> 00:13:54.620 align:middle line:10%
We can find the evidence of
those events having occurred.

00:13:54.620 --> 00:14:01.200 align:middle line:10%
Now, referring back to this
idea of the energy paradox,

00:14:01.200 --> 00:14:04.020 align:middle line:10%
what that means is that if
you're going to try to get rid

00:14:04.020 --> 00:14:07.110 align:middle line:10%
of 6,000,000 million cubic miles
of glacial ice in a few thousand

00:14:07.110 --> 00:14:09.550 align:middle line:10%
years, you've got to
have a lot of energy.

00:14:09.550 --> 00:14:11.840 align:middle line:10%
And where's that
energy coming from?

00:14:11.840 --> 00:14:13.940 align:middle line:10%
This was the paradox.

00:14:13.940 --> 00:14:19.480 align:middle line:10%
And there was some calculations
done saying, well, if you used--

00:14:19.480 --> 00:14:22.870 align:middle line:10%
it was assumed that the
primary source of such energy

00:14:22.870 --> 00:14:26.300 align:middle line:10%
would have to be the
sun, solar irradiation.

00:14:26.300 --> 00:14:28.730 align:middle line:10%
So what they did was
they started looking.

00:14:28.730 --> 00:14:31.090 align:middle line:10%
The geographers came
in and started looking.

00:14:31.090 --> 00:14:34.480 align:middle line:10%
The solar sciences started
looking, well, where on Earth

00:14:34.480 --> 00:14:39.460 align:middle line:10%
would you have the greatest
availability of solar irradiance

00:14:39.460 --> 00:14:40.460 align:middle line:10%
to melt ice?

00:14:40.460 --> 00:14:42.560 align:middle line:10%
And it turned out to
be tropical oceans.

00:14:42.560 --> 00:14:44.950 align:middle line:10%
Well, then this is where the
paradox came in because they

00:14:44.950 --> 00:14:46.670 align:middle line:10%
didn't do their calculations.

00:14:46.670 --> 00:14:50.870 align:middle line:10%
They said, well, if you took the
entire mass of ice over North

00:14:50.870 --> 00:14:54.320 align:middle line:10%
America and moved it
to the tropical oceans,

00:14:54.320 --> 00:14:57.050 align:middle line:10%
it would still take 20,000 to
30,000 years to melt the whole

00:14:57.050 --> 00:14:58.240 align:middle line:10%
thing.

00:14:58.240 --> 00:14:59.490 align:middle line:10%
So where does that leave us?

00:14:59.490 --> 00:15:01.490 align:middle line:10%
Well, this is the
energy paradox.

00:15:01.490 --> 00:15:04.930 align:middle line:10%
And so in order to
explain this, we

00:15:04.930 --> 00:15:09.070 align:middle line:10%
have to come up with a
source of inconceivable

00:15:09.070 --> 00:15:10.780 align:middle line:10%
magnitude of energy.

00:15:10.780 --> 00:15:13.930 align:middle line:10%
And I think there are
two potential sources.

00:15:13.930 --> 00:15:18.010 align:middle line:10%
One is direct impacts
into the oceans and ice

00:15:18.010 --> 00:15:21.700 align:middle line:10%
sheets of fragmented
cosmic bodies

00:15:21.700 --> 00:15:23.680 align:middle line:10%
like asteroids and comets.

00:15:23.680 --> 00:15:26.200 align:middle line:10%
And the other would be
tremendously powerful

00:15:26.200 --> 00:15:27.640 align:middle line:10%
solar storms.

00:15:27.640 --> 00:15:30.640 align:middle line:10%
There has been a recent paper
just published that puts

00:15:30.640 --> 00:15:35.230 align:middle line:10%
meltwater pulse 1A at the very
same time there appears to have

00:15:35.230 --> 00:15:37.500 align:middle line:10%
been a gigantic solar storm.

00:15:37.500 --> 00:15:40.950 align:middle line:10%
This is now dated
to around 14,300--

00:15:40.950 --> 00:15:43.080 align:middle line:10%
to 14,400 years ago.

00:15:43.080 --> 00:15:45.190 align:middle line:84%
How many of you heard
of the Carrington Event?

00:15:45.190 --> 00:15:48.600 align:middle line:84%
Happened in the 1800s, and it
was just after telegraphs had

00:15:48.600 --> 00:15:49.400 align:middle line:90%
been in place.

00:15:49.400 --> 00:15:52.480 align:middle line:84%
And I mean, it basically
blew out the telegraphs.

00:15:52.480 --> 00:15:54.700 align:middle line:84%
And now the Carrington
Event, what we now know

00:15:54.700 --> 00:15:58.510 align:middle line:84%
is that is a relatively
mild solar event.

00:15:58.510 --> 00:16:04.090 align:middle line:10%
This is another variable in this
equation of life on Earth that

00:16:04.090 --> 00:16:07.480 align:middle line:10%
we at some point in the long
range planning need to account

00:16:07.480 --> 00:16:12.670 align:middle line:10%
for the fact that unlike the
models of solar change that were

00:16:12.670 --> 00:16:17.410 align:middle line:10%
in place when, say, the first
climate models began to be

00:16:17.410 --> 00:16:21.100 align:middle line:10%
developed in late '80s and '90s
that led to the global warming

00:16:21.100 --> 00:16:25.420 align:middle line:10%
scenario, the interpretation
of the sun was expressed

00:16:25.420 --> 00:16:27.780 align:middle line:10%
in the term solar constant.

00:16:27.780 --> 00:16:31.090 align:middle line:10%
So in that model
of the sun, the sun

00:16:31.090 --> 00:16:34.240 align:middle line:10%
never changed enough to
really warrant being included

00:16:34.240 --> 00:16:35.840 align:middle line:10%
in the computer models.

00:16:35.840 --> 00:16:40.300 align:middle line:10%
Well, since then now we've
deployed a whole generation

00:16:40.300 --> 00:16:42.240 align:middle line:10%
of solar observing satellites.

00:16:42.240 --> 00:16:47.020 align:middle line:10%
We're also finding and observing
the activity of sun-like stars

00:16:47.020 --> 00:16:48.130 align:middle line:10%
nearby.

00:16:48.130 --> 00:16:51.490 align:middle line:10%
And what is leading us
to is the realization

00:16:51.490 --> 00:16:54.670 align:middle line:10%
that, yes, the
sun does sometimes

00:16:54.670 --> 00:16:56.890 align:middle line:10%
go through cyclical changes.

00:16:56.890 --> 00:17:01.010 align:middle line:10%
That it's not a solar
constant, that there

00:17:01.010 --> 00:17:03.092 align:middle line:10%
are tremendous
variations in the sun.

00:17:03.092 --> 00:17:04.550 align:middle line:10%
There's some new
research that I've

00:17:04.550 --> 00:17:07.040 align:middle line:10%
been exploring that
suggests there's

00:17:07.040 --> 00:17:11.089 align:middle line:10%
a relationship to the
infall of cometary masses

00:17:11.089 --> 00:17:14.033 align:middle line:10%
into the chromosphere that can
actually trigger solar storms.

00:17:14.033 --> 00:17:15.950 align:middle line:10%
I'm not going to get
into that too much today,

00:17:15.950 --> 00:17:18.500 align:middle line:10%
but I do talk about
that a lot in my podcast

00:17:18.500 --> 00:17:20.420 align:middle line:10%
and show the data, and so on.

00:17:20.420 --> 00:17:22.849 align:middle line:10%
So anyways, the Heinrich event--

00:17:22.849 --> 00:17:27.859 align:middle line:10%
what happens is they are these
periodic occurrences where

00:17:27.859 --> 00:17:32.300 align:middle line:10%
large masses of ice are
disgorged into the oceans,

00:17:32.300 --> 00:17:36.560 align:middle line:10%
primarily, coming from
the ice over Canada

00:17:36.560 --> 00:17:38.350 align:middle line:10%
and over Northwestern Europe.

00:17:38.350 --> 00:17:41.630 align:middle line:10%
It's almost as if there's
a gigantic breakup of ice,

00:17:41.630 --> 00:17:45.470 align:middle line:10%
and you have armadas of
thousands of icebergs disgorging

00:17:45.470 --> 00:17:46.770 align:middle line:10%
into the ocean.

00:17:46.770 --> 00:17:49.160 align:middle line:10%
Those icebergs then drift south.

00:17:49.160 --> 00:17:51.570 align:middle line:10%
And those icebergs
were glacial ice.

00:17:51.570 --> 00:17:53.690 align:middle line:10%
So when the glaciers are
moving over the land,

00:17:53.690 --> 00:17:57.560 align:middle line:10%
they're scooping up material,
the bedrock and the soil

00:17:57.560 --> 00:18:00.140 align:middle line:10%
and all of this stuff,
gravel, pulverizing it.

00:18:00.140 --> 00:18:02.730 align:middle line:10%
And that gets incorporated
into the glacial ice.

00:18:02.730 --> 00:18:05.450 align:middle line:10%
Then when the glacial ice
migrates to the coast.

00:18:05.450 --> 00:18:09.020 align:middle line:10%
And in that whatever it is that
triggers these Heinrich events,

00:18:09.020 --> 00:18:12.020 align:middle line:10%
you have this massive
convulsion of icebergs

00:18:12.020 --> 00:18:13.650 align:middle line:10%
discharging into the ocean.

00:18:13.650 --> 00:18:14.690 align:middle line:10%
They drift south.

00:18:14.690 --> 00:18:17.600 align:middle line:10%
And when they do this, they
begin to melt. And as they melt,

00:18:17.600 --> 00:18:21.410 align:middle line:10%
their cargo of gravel
and coarse material

00:18:21.410 --> 00:18:25.620 align:middle line:10%
falls to the ocean floor and
leaves very distinct layers.

00:18:25.620 --> 00:18:27.300 align:middle line:10%
And those can be dated.

00:18:27.300 --> 00:18:30.530 align:middle line:10%
And so from this
kind of evidence,

00:18:30.530 --> 00:18:34.570 align:middle line:10%
we can now begin to reconstruct
the ancient climate.

00:18:34.570 --> 00:18:36.820 align:middle line:10%
Before moving on, I'm just
going to show you one more.

00:18:36.820 --> 00:18:38.970 align:middle line:10%
Here's a great little depiction.

00:18:38.970 --> 00:18:41.840 align:middle line:10%
This is the Chalice Well
lid at Glastonbury Abbey.

00:18:41.840 --> 00:18:45.410 align:middle line:10%
And it shows a perfect
depiction of the Vesica Piscis.

00:18:45.410 --> 00:18:47.960 align:middle line:84%
And it connects it
directly with the idea

00:18:47.960 --> 00:18:52.640 align:middle line:84%
of the Holy Grail, which is
something that I also lecture on

00:18:52.640 --> 00:18:54.830 align:middle line:84%
because I think that
the Grail literature was

00:18:54.830 --> 00:18:59.945 align:middle line:84%
a vehicle for transmitting a lot
of really crucial information.

00:18:59.945 --> 00:19:01.820 align:middle line:10%
And if you know about
the quest of the Grail,

00:19:01.820 --> 00:19:04.130 align:middle line:10%
you understand that--

00:19:04.130 --> 00:19:06.480 align:middle line:10%
well, what was the
secret of the Grail?

00:19:06.480 --> 00:19:09.890 align:middle line:10%
Anybody can tell me, what
is the secret of the Grail?

00:19:09.890 --> 00:19:14.190 align:middle line:84%
It was that the king
and the land are one.

00:19:14.190 --> 00:19:14.990 align:middle line:90%
That was it.

00:19:14.990 --> 00:19:16.810 align:middle line:10%
And remember, if you
read the stories--

00:19:16.810 --> 00:19:20.110 align:middle line:10%
and I cannot recommend
highly enough reading some

00:19:20.110 --> 00:19:22.460 align:middle line:10%
of the stories by--
there are translations--

00:19:22.460 --> 00:19:26.290 align:middle line:10%
Wolfram von Eschenbach, Chrétien
de Troyes, Robert de Boron,

00:19:26.290 --> 00:19:28.940 align:middle line:10%
and the anonymous
author of "Parlez Vous."

00:19:28.940 --> 00:19:31.180 align:middle line:10%
This makes some
extraordinary reading.

00:19:31.180 --> 00:19:33.910 align:middle line:10%
But what you find there,
the quest of the Grail

00:19:33.910 --> 00:19:36.100 align:middle line:10%
was about the Grail
was the antidote

00:19:36.100 --> 00:19:39.880 align:middle line:10%
to the debilitating ailment
that the king was suffering

00:19:39.880 --> 00:19:46.030 align:middle line:10%
simultaneously with the land
around which had degenerated

00:19:46.030 --> 00:19:47.450 align:middle line:10%
into a wasteland.

00:19:47.450 --> 00:19:50.650 align:middle line:10%
And so the Grail
was the antidote

00:19:50.650 --> 00:19:54.320 align:middle line:10%
not only to the ailing
king but the ailing land.

00:19:54.320 --> 00:19:57.550 align:middle line:10%
And the recovery of the Grail
would not only restore the king,

00:19:57.550 --> 00:19:59.710 align:middle line:10%
but it would restore
the land as well,

00:19:59.710 --> 00:20:01.550 align:middle line:10%
that it would restore
the wasteland.

00:20:01.550 --> 00:20:03.970 align:middle line:10%
Well, interestingly, we
can look at things now,

00:20:03.970 --> 00:20:08.680 align:middle line:10%
and we know that the Arthurian
tales were centered right

00:20:08.680 --> 00:20:12.330 align:middle line:10%
around the year 540 AD.

00:20:12.330 --> 00:20:15.170 align:middle line:10%
In fact, the famous
battle of Camlann,

00:20:15.170 --> 00:20:22.640 align:middle line:10%
where Arthur fought to
death his son, Mordred,

00:20:22.640 --> 00:20:25.940 align:middle line:10%
is usually dated at 540 AD.

00:20:25.940 --> 00:20:32.630 align:middle line:10%
Well, six years from 536 to 542
AD were the four coldest years

00:20:32.630 --> 00:20:36.020 align:middle line:10%
of the last 2,000 years,
were the six coldest years

00:20:36.020 --> 00:20:38.386 align:middle line:10%
of the last 2,000.

00:20:38.386 --> 00:20:43.160 align:middle line:10%
536 AD was the single coldest
year of the last 2,000 years.

00:20:43.160 --> 00:20:47.600 align:middle line:10%
Subsequent to 536 AD,
for the next 10 years,

00:20:47.600 --> 00:20:50.390 align:middle line:10%
forest growth almost
came to a screeching halt

00:20:50.390 --> 00:20:51.720 align:middle line:10%
over the northern hemisphere.

00:20:51.720 --> 00:20:54.960 align:middle line:10%
Something major occurred
in the global climate.

00:20:54.960 --> 00:20:58.820 align:middle line:10%
It caused global cooling,
and literally, it

00:20:58.820 --> 00:21:01.400 align:middle line:10%
rendered the landscape of
the northern hemisphere

00:21:01.400 --> 00:21:04.530 align:middle line:10%
over large region into
a literal wasteland.

00:21:04.530 --> 00:21:07.790 align:middle line:10%
So we now know that there's this
correlation between something

00:21:07.790 --> 00:21:10.400 align:middle line:10%
that's been well documented
now through tree ring

00:21:10.400 --> 00:21:12.590 align:middle line:10%
records and all kinds
of other evidence

00:21:12.590 --> 00:21:15.740 align:middle line:10%
that fits precisely in
with the Grail stories.

00:21:15.740 --> 00:21:19.280 align:middle line:10%
So right there, I find
that that correlation

00:21:19.280 --> 00:21:21.120 align:middle line:10%
is profoundly important.

00:21:21.120 --> 00:21:23.900 align:middle line:10%
And it means that in
the Grail literature,

00:21:23.900 --> 00:21:28.640 align:middle line:10%
which all came out between
roughly 1,180 and 1,230,

00:21:28.640 --> 00:21:32.420 align:middle line:10%
in there in about a half a
century is dealing with that

00:21:32.420 --> 00:21:36.380 align:middle line:10%
epoch and has used that
epoch as a symbolical vehicle

00:21:36.380 --> 00:21:39.350 align:middle line:10%
for the transmission
of certain information.

00:21:39.350 --> 00:21:42.080 align:middle line:84%
Somebody over here said energy,
and I would agree with that.

00:21:42.080 --> 00:21:43.850 align:middle line:10%
Because I think
what we're actually

00:21:43.850 --> 00:21:46.430 align:middle line:10%
dealing with here in
the Grail literature

00:21:46.430 --> 00:21:50.420 align:middle line:10%
is a way of symbolically
encoding information

00:21:50.420 --> 00:21:52.888 align:middle line:10%
about a lost technology.

00:21:52.888 --> 00:21:54.930 align:middle line:10%
Hopefully, we'll have some
time to get into that,

00:21:54.930 --> 00:21:56.300 align:middle line:10%
but let's keep going.

00:21:56.300 --> 00:22:00.260 align:middle line:10%
Here's the overlay showing just
two examples of the link between

00:22:00.260 --> 00:22:02.570 align:middle line:10%
geometry and the
measure of time,

00:22:02.570 --> 00:22:04.640 align:middle line:10%
the length of the
platonic month,

00:22:04.640 --> 00:22:08.250 align:middle line:10%
or the average age 2,160 years.

00:22:08.250 --> 00:22:13.430 align:middle line:84%
The total degree measurement
of a cube is 2,160 degrees.

00:22:13.430 --> 00:22:16.820 align:middle line:10%
Now, if you go back and you
read your book of Revelation,

00:22:16.820 --> 00:22:21.260 align:middle line:10%
the Apokálypsis, you read
about the descent of the Holy

00:22:21.260 --> 00:22:22.670 align:middle line:10%
City out of the heavens.

00:22:22.670 --> 00:22:25.010 align:middle line:10%
And it's described as a cube.

00:22:25.010 --> 00:22:27.020 align:middle line:10%
And certain numbers
are given, which

00:22:27.020 --> 00:22:29.700 align:middle line:10%
I'm not going to get into today
because we'd run out of time.

00:22:29.700 --> 00:22:32.000 align:middle line:10%
But certain numbers
are given, key numbers,

00:22:32.000 --> 00:22:33.860 align:middle line:10%
sacred numbers that
are given to describe

00:22:33.860 --> 00:22:35.820 align:middle line:10%
the dimensions of this cube.

00:22:35.820 --> 00:22:38.840 align:middle line:10%
The important thing
is that the numbers

00:22:38.840 --> 00:22:41.600 align:middle line:10%
are part of the canon
of sacred numbers

00:22:41.600 --> 00:22:45.390 align:middle line:10%
that have come to us from many
venues all around the world.

00:22:45.390 --> 00:22:49.670 align:middle line:10%
And the fact that these
numbers can not only

00:22:49.670 --> 00:22:52.740 align:middle line:10%
be used to measure space
but also measure time.

00:22:52.740 --> 00:22:57.340 align:middle line:10%
You saw that the four seasons
of the great year were measured

00:22:57.340 --> 00:22:59.380 align:middle line:10%
as 6,480 years.

00:22:59.380 --> 00:23:04.090 align:middle line:10%
I will mention that at 6,480
years ago, given a few decades,

00:23:04.090 --> 00:23:07.360 align:middle line:10%
there was a major climate
shift from what was called

00:23:07.360 --> 00:23:12.490 align:middle line:10%
the Holocene Climatic
Optimum that followed the end

00:23:12.490 --> 00:23:14.170 align:middle line:10%
of the Great Ice Age where--

00:23:14.170 --> 00:23:15.280 align:middle line:10%
and this is true--

00:23:15.280 --> 00:23:19.060 align:middle line:10%
global climate temperatures
were up to 1 to 2 degrees

00:23:19.060 --> 00:23:21.100 align:middle line:10%
warmer than now.

00:23:21.100 --> 00:23:23.320 align:middle line:10%
You're not being told this
through mainstream media,

00:23:23.320 --> 00:23:26.280 align:middle line:10%
but this is true, and
it's well-documented.

00:23:26.280 --> 00:23:31.170 align:middle line:10%
At 6,480 years ago when the
vernal equinox was on the cusp

00:23:31.170 --> 00:23:37.260 align:middle line:10%
of Taurus, there was a major
and rapid climate shift that

00:23:37.260 --> 00:23:42.720 align:middle line:10%
the climatologists have called
the onset of the neoglaciation.

00:23:42.720 --> 00:23:46.990 align:middle line:10%
And there was a precipitous
drop in temperatures worldwide.

00:23:46.990 --> 00:23:49.560 align:middle line:10%
And there was also a
major cultural upheaval

00:23:49.560 --> 00:23:52.750 align:middle line:10%
that occurred consistent
with that date.

00:23:52.750 --> 00:23:57.960 align:middle line:10%
Now, 2,160 years later, we're
at the cusp of Taurus, Aries.

00:23:57.960 --> 00:24:01.810 align:middle line:10%
And this is usually
dated at 4,320.

00:24:01.810 --> 00:24:06.360 align:middle line:10%
If you study the cycles of
civilization and cultural

00:24:06.360 --> 00:24:09.450 align:middle line:10%
collapse, you'll find that there
was a major cultural collapse

00:24:09.450 --> 00:24:14.640 align:middle line:10%
that was typically dated at
4,300 years ago within 20 years

00:24:14.640 --> 00:24:15.850 align:middle line:10%
of that cusp.

00:24:15.850 --> 00:24:18.390 align:middle line:10%
Now, what I'm getting
at here, these examples

00:24:18.390 --> 00:24:20.430 align:middle line:10%
could be multiplied.

00:24:20.430 --> 00:24:23.170 align:middle line:84%
Were the ancient
peoples on to something?

00:24:23.170 --> 00:24:26.820 align:middle line:84%
Did they understand the cyclical
nature of global change?

00:24:26.820 --> 00:24:30.300 align:middle line:84%
I think the evidence is
getting very powerfully

00:24:30.300 --> 00:24:32.590 align:middle line:90%
supportive of that conclusion.

00:24:32.590 --> 00:24:35.850 align:middle line:84%
And then, if we go to Plato's
geometry of the universe,

00:24:35.850 --> 00:24:40.440 align:middle line:84%
the dodecahedron, the total
number of 12 pentagonal faces

00:24:40.440 --> 00:24:44.680 align:middle line:84%
each of which is measured by
540 degrees internal angle is

00:24:44.680 --> 00:24:47.380 align:middle line:90%
the total is 6,480 degrees.

00:24:47.380 --> 00:24:53.130 align:middle line:10%
So now this in turn becomes
a symbol for cosmic time.

00:24:53.130 --> 00:24:56.020 align:middle line:10%
And so we find the same
number measuring not only

00:24:56.020 --> 00:24:59.170 align:middle line:10%
the dodecahedron, which is
a model of cosmic space,

00:24:59.170 --> 00:25:02.080 align:middle line:10%
it's also measuring a
duration, a span of time

00:25:02.080 --> 00:25:04.420 align:middle line:10%
that we could call
cosmic time, and also

00:25:04.420 --> 00:25:06.890 align:middle line:10%
the pulse of
catastrophic episodes.

00:25:06.890 --> 00:25:11.950 align:middle line:10%
So double this, and you are
12,960 or within one century

00:25:11.950 --> 00:25:14.330 align:middle line:10%
of the Younger Dryas boundary.

00:25:14.330 --> 00:25:16.190 align:middle line:84%
And the evidence
now is suggesting

00:25:16.190 --> 00:25:18.830 align:middle line:84%
that the Younger Dryas
boundary occurred

00:25:18.830 --> 00:25:23.420 align:middle line:84%
because of a massive series
of cosmic impacts on Earth.

00:25:23.420 --> 00:25:25.730 align:middle line:10%
Now, I don't have time
to get into it today,

00:25:25.730 --> 00:25:28.490 align:middle line:10%
but there's evidence
accumulating

00:25:28.490 --> 00:25:33.380 align:middle line:10%
that the delivery of potentially
Earth-crossing cosmic material

00:25:33.380 --> 00:25:36.080 align:middle line:10%
is occurring on
a cyclical basis.

00:25:36.080 --> 00:25:39.380 align:middle line:10%
Now, I think this is something
that perhaps our ancestors were

00:25:39.380 --> 00:25:43.040 align:middle line:10%
aware of and why they were so
obsessively observing the night

00:25:43.040 --> 00:25:44.630 align:middle line:10%
sky.

00:25:44.630 --> 00:25:47.040 align:middle line:84%
Now, let's look at some
of these numbers here.

00:25:47.040 --> 00:25:49.370 align:middle line:84%
"In the second book was the
history of the ten kings

00:25:49.370 --> 00:25:50.220 align:middle line:90%
of the Chaldeans."

00:25:50.220 --> 00:25:53.030 align:middle line:10%
This is from Alexander
Polyhistor in his Commentaries

00:25:53.030 --> 00:25:54.140 align:middle line:10%
on Berossus.

00:25:54.140 --> 00:25:57.500 align:middle line:84%
And the periods of each reign,
which consisted collectively

00:25:57.500 --> 00:26:00.680 align:middle line:84%
of a hundred and twenty shar's,
or four hundred and thirty-two

00:26:00.680 --> 00:26:03.320 align:middle line:84%
thousand years; reaching
to the time of the deluge."

00:26:03.320 --> 00:26:05.340 align:middle line:90%
432,000 years.

00:26:05.340 --> 00:26:09.470 align:middle line:84%
This is the number that we
find recurring repeatedly.

00:26:09.470 --> 00:26:13.160 align:middle line:84%
So here's the pre-diluvian
god kings of Sumeria.

00:26:13.160 --> 00:26:16.890 align:middle line:84%
And you can look down the years
of the reign on the right.

00:26:16.890 --> 00:26:21.570 align:middle line:84%
And all of these are part of
our canon of cosmic numbers.

00:26:21.570 --> 00:26:24.870 align:middle line:84%
And then they all
total to 432,000.

00:26:24.870 --> 00:26:28.090 align:middle line:84%
You will notice that
Amemnon, the King Amemnon--

00:26:28.090 --> 00:26:30.090 align:middle line:84%
and I don't necessarily
think these are literal.

00:26:30.090 --> 00:26:34.370 align:middle line:84%
I think they're symbolical, but
the reign was given as 43,280

00:26:34.370 --> 00:26:35.170 align:middle line:90%
years.

00:26:35.170 --> 00:26:37.220 align:middle line:84%
Add an extra 0 on to
that, and then you've

00:26:37.220 --> 00:26:42.140 align:middle line:84%
got the total reigns of the
10 pre-diluvian, antediluvian

00:26:42.140 --> 00:26:46.100 align:middle line:84%
kings that reigned
before the Great Flood.

00:26:46.100 --> 00:26:49.970 align:middle line:84%
Then if we go to the
tabulations of the Vedic ages,

00:26:49.970 --> 00:26:55.310 align:middle line:84%
we see that they pick up where
the Sumerian ages leave off.

00:26:55.310 --> 00:26:59.580 align:middle line:84%
So they start with their
Kali Yuga at 432,000 years.

00:26:59.580 --> 00:27:00.550 align:middle line:90%
And then you've got--

00:27:00.550 --> 00:27:04.410 align:middle line:84%
it goes through a
series of 1, 2, 3, 4.

00:27:04.410 --> 00:27:07.250 align:middle line:84%
So you double the
432,000, you get 864,000.

00:27:07.250 --> 00:27:10.580 align:middle line:84%
You triple it,
you get 1,296,000.

00:27:10.580 --> 00:27:13.563 align:middle line:90%
And then times 4 is 1,000,728.

00:27:13.563 --> 00:27:15.230 align:middle line:84%
And then you add those
together, and you

00:27:15.230 --> 00:27:18.110 align:middle line:84%
get the age of the
Maha Yuga or Great Yuga

00:27:18.110 --> 00:27:20.640 align:middle line:84%
and it's exactly 10
times the Kali Yuga.

00:27:20.640 --> 00:27:22.700 align:middle line:84%
So again, we have this
repetition and emphasis

00:27:22.700 --> 00:27:25.490 align:middle line:90%
upon the number 432.

00:27:25.490 --> 00:27:29.330 align:middle line:84%
And we're going to learn that
there is a reason for this.

00:27:29.330 --> 00:27:32.280 align:middle line:84%
Now in the Vedas we
find verses like this.

00:27:32.280 --> 00:27:33.840 align:middle line:90%
And this is how it was encoded.

00:27:33.840 --> 00:27:36.540 align:middle line:84%
"So let the Brahman hear
the praise we utter.

00:27:36.540 --> 00:27:40.280 align:middle line:84%
This hast the four
horned buffalo emitted.

00:27:40.280 --> 00:27:43.950 align:middle line:84%
Four are his horns, three
are the feet that bear him;

00:27:43.950 --> 00:27:47.460 align:middle line:84%
his heads are two, his
hands are seven in number."

00:27:47.460 --> 00:27:50.670 align:middle line:84%
So there we have
the 4, 3, and 2.

00:27:50.670 --> 00:27:55.820 align:middle line:10%
And this is a way that
these numbers were encoded.

00:27:55.820 --> 00:28:01.980 align:middle line:10%
Now, here is from the late '70s,
which has been confirmed over

00:28:01.980 --> 00:28:03.390 align:middle line:10%
and over again.

00:28:03.390 --> 00:28:05.910 align:middle line:84%
Here you can see that
red line represents

00:28:05.910 --> 00:28:09.420 align:middle line:84%
the current temperature, the
regime that we're in now.

00:28:09.420 --> 00:28:12.940 align:middle line:84%
And this is going
back 400,000 years.

00:28:12.940 --> 00:28:14.820 align:middle line:84%
And what you see
here it's not exact,

00:28:14.820 --> 00:28:19.690 align:middle line:84%
but it's a regular repetition
of glacial interglacial cycles.

00:28:19.690 --> 00:28:22.320 align:middle line:84%
Now, this is coming
very close to conforming

00:28:22.320 --> 00:28:24.180 align:middle line:90%
to the ancient model.

00:28:24.180 --> 00:28:26.760 align:middle line:84%
And everything you see
above that red line

00:28:26.760 --> 00:28:30.840 align:middle line:84%
would be an interglacial, and
every trough would be a glacial.

00:28:30.840 --> 00:28:33.730 align:middle line:84%
And then you have
these areas in between.

00:28:33.730 --> 00:28:36.830 align:middle line:84%
So what this is
telling us is if we

00:28:36.830 --> 00:28:40.580 align:middle line:84%
were going to use this kind of
a graph to predict what's ahead,

00:28:40.580 --> 00:28:42.500 align:middle line:84%
I would suggest that
there's probably

00:28:42.500 --> 00:28:44.000 align:middle line:84%
a greater danger
of global cooling

00:28:44.000 --> 00:28:45.740 align:middle line:90%
than there is of global warming.

00:28:45.740 --> 00:28:47.810 align:middle line:10%
If we go to the
next slide, this is

00:28:47.810 --> 00:28:49.950 align:middle line:10%
your long-term global
temperature changes.

00:28:49.950 --> 00:28:53.930 align:middle line:10%
These have been reconstructed
from multiple proxies.

00:28:53.930 --> 00:28:57.590 align:middle line:10%
If we go back, we
can see departure

00:28:57.590 --> 00:29:01.760 align:middle line:10%
from present day temperature
on the left, the Y axis.

00:29:01.760 --> 00:29:04.790 align:middle line:10%
The X axis, we're going
back to the Late Cretaceous,

00:29:04.790 --> 00:29:07.070 align:middle line:10%
over 65 million years ago.

00:29:07.070 --> 00:29:11.510 align:middle line:10%
And what you see is that
the modern, the Pleistocene,

00:29:11.510 --> 00:29:13.250 align:middle line:10%
look where the Pleistocene is.

00:29:13.250 --> 00:29:19.310 align:middle line:10%
The Pleistocene is
this right here.

00:29:19.310 --> 00:29:22.160 align:middle line:10%
Now, if you were going to
look at this graph, which

00:29:22.160 --> 00:29:25.520 align:middle line:10%
has been replicated over
and over again, confirmed

00:29:25.520 --> 00:29:28.245 align:middle line:10%
by all kinds of
independent evidence,

00:29:28.245 --> 00:29:29.870 align:middle line:10%
if you were to look
at this, what would

00:29:29.870 --> 00:29:33.230 align:middle line:10%
you say is the
anomalous temperature

00:29:33.230 --> 00:29:34.590 align:middle line:10%
regime of the planet?

00:29:34.590 --> 00:29:36.390 align:middle line:90%
Well, clearly, it's this.

00:29:36.390 --> 00:29:40.850 align:middle line:84%
This is the period where I said
characterized by the oscillation

00:29:40.850 --> 00:29:42.950 align:middle line:90%
of glacial interglacial ages.

00:29:42.950 --> 00:29:48.290 align:middle line:84%
And it's the coldest period
of the last 65 million years.

00:29:48.290 --> 00:29:50.450 align:middle line:10%
So when we talk
about, well, what

00:29:50.450 --> 00:29:53.220 align:middle line:10%
is the normal
temperature of the Earth?

00:29:53.220 --> 00:29:55.850 align:middle line:10%
It all depends on our
frame of reference.

00:29:55.850 --> 00:30:00.950 align:middle line:10%
So the thing is, is when-- to
create the campaign of fear

00:30:00.950 --> 00:30:03.860 align:middle line:10%
over global warming,
the frames of references

00:30:03.860 --> 00:30:08.390 align:middle line:10%
are very carefully chosen to
convey one particular impression

00:30:08.390 --> 00:30:10.350 align:middle line:10%
and exclude others.

00:30:10.350 --> 00:30:14.510 align:middle line:84%
This shows-- this is
another thing that is never

00:30:14.510 --> 00:30:16.190 align:middle line:84%
talked about, but
it happens to be

00:30:16.190 --> 00:30:20.730 align:middle line:84%
true, well verified for
probably at least 100 years now.

00:30:20.730 --> 00:30:23.420 align:middle line:84%
This shows-- on the
bottom here what

00:30:23.420 --> 00:30:28.100 align:middle line:84%
it's showing you here is parts
per million of carbon dioxide.

00:30:28.100 --> 00:30:32.810 align:middle line:84%
And up on the left-hand side,
it says the net downtrending

00:30:32.810 --> 00:30:34.807 align:middle line:84%
forcing in watts
per square meter.

00:30:34.807 --> 00:30:35.640 align:middle line:90%
What does that mean?

00:30:35.640 --> 00:30:37.250 align:middle line:10%
In simple terms,
what that is it's

00:30:37.250 --> 00:30:41.660 align:middle line:10%
talking abut you understand
the whole scenario is this,

00:30:41.660 --> 00:30:44.060 align:middle line:10%
you have shortwave
radiation coming through,

00:30:44.060 --> 00:30:46.260 align:middle line:10%
penetrating through
the atmosphere.

00:30:46.260 --> 00:30:49.560 align:middle line:10%
Penetrates through the
greenhouse gases of water vapor,

00:30:49.560 --> 00:30:55.650 align:middle line:10%
greenhouse gases like methane,
carbon dioxide, ozone.

00:30:55.650 --> 00:30:56.850 align:middle line:10%
Penetrates down.

00:30:56.850 --> 00:30:58.270 align:middle line:10%
It's absorbed into the Earth.

00:30:58.270 --> 00:31:00.330 align:middle line:10%
And then that
energy is reradiated

00:31:00.330 --> 00:31:05.190 align:middle line:10%
at longwave wavelengths
roughly in the window

00:31:05.190 --> 00:31:09.590 align:middle line:10%
of about 14 to 17 microns.

00:31:09.590 --> 00:31:10.390 align:middle line:10%
OK.

00:31:10.390 --> 00:31:13.860 align:middle line:10%
Now what happens is that if you
look at this graph, what it's

00:31:13.860 --> 00:31:17.460 align:middle line:10%
telling you, this blue
line is showing you

00:31:17.460 --> 00:31:21.780 align:middle line:10%
the greenhouse capacity
of carbon dioxide

00:31:21.780 --> 00:31:23.560 align:middle line:10%
in the atmosphere.

00:31:23.560 --> 00:31:26.062 align:middle line:84%
What you see when you look
at this graph is that--

00:31:26.062 --> 00:31:28.020 align:middle line:84%
and when you're talking
about downward forcing,

00:31:28.020 --> 00:31:31.950 align:middle line:84%
it's talking about the
canopy of greenhouse gases

00:31:31.950 --> 00:31:34.920 align:middle line:84%
captures that heat, and
then reradiates some of it

00:31:34.920 --> 00:31:35.890 align:middle line:90%
back down to the Earth.

00:31:35.890 --> 00:31:36.730 align:middle line:90%
That's the idea.

00:31:36.730 --> 00:31:39.070 align:middle line:10%
Then that warms the
lower troposphere.

00:31:39.070 --> 00:31:43.770 align:middle line:84%
But what you see here is
that most of that heating

00:31:43.770 --> 00:31:46.950 align:middle line:84%
effect of carbon dioxide is in
the first 100 parts per million.

00:31:46.950 --> 00:31:50.340 align:middle line:90%
And then it rapidly diminishes.

00:31:50.340 --> 00:31:53.880 align:middle line:84%
Logarithmically, we can actually
look at another graph here,

00:31:53.880 --> 00:31:56.050 align:middle line:84%
and you can actually,
barely see it.

00:31:56.050 --> 00:32:01.450 align:middle line:84%
Look at this here from 0 up
to 250 watts per square meter,

00:32:01.450 --> 00:32:05.490 align:middle line:84%
you can see from this that
almost all of the heat

00:32:05.490 --> 00:32:08.970 align:middle line:84%
captures within the first
100 parts per million.

00:32:08.970 --> 00:32:11.470 align:middle line:84%
And then it tapers
off to almost nothing.

00:32:11.470 --> 00:32:12.880 align:middle line:90%
This is well-known.

00:32:12.880 --> 00:32:15.510 align:middle line:84%
And they've had to
manipulate computer models

00:32:15.510 --> 00:32:19.410 align:middle line:84%
to obscure this fact that
the ability of carbon dioxide

00:32:19.410 --> 00:32:21.540 align:middle line:84%
to capture additional heat
beyond what it already

00:32:21.540 --> 00:32:24.170 align:middle line:90%
has is almost nil.

00:32:24.170 --> 00:32:26.770 align:middle line:84%
And I could spend a whole hour
or two talking about this.

00:32:26.770 --> 00:32:27.570 align:middle line:90%
I'm not.

00:32:27.570 --> 00:32:29.690 align:middle line:10%
I just wanted to bring
that to your attention

00:32:29.690 --> 00:32:33.650 align:middle line:10%
because there are narratives
that have been concocted

00:32:33.650 --> 00:32:35.720 align:middle line:10%
that are now being
used to instill fear

00:32:35.720 --> 00:32:40.020 align:middle line:10%
in people, which is,
ultimately, a tool of control.

00:32:40.020 --> 00:32:44.160 align:middle line:84%
So this is just a graphic that
will show you the dramatic

00:32:44.160 --> 00:32:50.953 align:middle line:84%
changes between, say,
15,000 years ago and now.

00:32:50.953 --> 00:32:53.370 align:middle line:84%
So that's your 6,000,000 and
7,000,000 million cubic miles

00:32:53.370 --> 00:32:55.320 align:middle line:84%
of ice that you
have to get rid of.

00:32:55.320 --> 00:33:00.810 align:middle line:84%
Here's one of the founding
fathers of modern climatology,

00:33:00.810 --> 00:33:02.130 align:middle line:90%
Hermann Flohn.

00:33:02.130 --> 00:33:03.570 align:middle line:90%
He's worth reading.

00:33:03.570 --> 00:33:06.190 align:middle line:84%
But let me tell you
what he discovered.

00:33:06.190 --> 00:33:08.170 align:middle line:84%
And this goes back and
has not been disproven.

00:33:08.170 --> 00:33:10.100 align:middle line:84%
It's only been
confirmed since then.

00:33:10.100 --> 00:33:14.320 align:middle line:84%
This was 1979 "From the
viewpoint of the climatologist,

00:33:14.320 --> 00:33:16.530 align:middle line:84%
the most important result
of these investigations

00:33:16.530 --> 00:33:18.930 align:middle line:84%
is the fact that within the
human timescale of about

00:33:18.930 --> 00:33:22.920 align:middle line:84%
100 years or less, our
climate is much more

00:33:22.920 --> 00:33:25.080 align:middle line:90%
variable than hitherto assumed.

00:33:25.080 --> 00:33:27.540 align:middle line:84%
Especially important,
and indeed disquieting,

00:33:27.540 --> 00:33:30.330 align:middle line:84%
is the evidence of abrupt
coolings within warm

00:33:30.330 --> 00:33:33.870 align:middle line:84%
interglacial periods, apparently
as rare events with a recurrence

00:33:33.870 --> 00:33:35.730 align:middle line:90%
interval of 10,000 years."

00:33:35.730 --> 00:33:40.210 align:middle line:10%
Remember, I said, we're in the
current Holocene is 11,600.

00:33:40.210 --> 00:33:43.170 align:middle line:10%
So we've already gone
beyond any previous

00:33:43.170 --> 00:33:45.600 align:middle line:10%
by a millennia or two
any previous period

00:33:45.600 --> 00:33:47.967 align:middle line:10%
of comparable warmth.

00:33:47.967 --> 00:33:49.800 align:middle line:84%
And then he goes on to
say that "The problem

00:33:49.800 --> 00:33:53.230 align:middle line:84%
of abrupt intense cooling
during the interglacial climate

00:33:53.230 --> 00:33:56.350 align:middle line:84%
similar to the present climate
resembles, to some extent,

00:33:56.350 --> 00:33:59.170 align:middle line:84%
the Damocles' sword hanging
high above the globe

00:33:59.170 --> 00:34:00.460 align:middle line:90%
and its inhabitants.

00:34:00.460 --> 00:34:03.410 align:middle line:84%
Because of its possible
consequence for the human race,

00:34:03.410 --> 00:34:06.400 align:middle line:84%
its study deserves a
much higher priority."

00:34:06.400 --> 00:34:10.003 align:middle line:10%
I read this paper when it came
out in 1979 and then in 1980

00:34:10.003 --> 00:34:11.920 align:middle line:10%
when I heard that the
United Nations Framework

00:34:11.920 --> 00:34:15.310 align:middle line:10%
Convention on Climate Change
was going to establish the IPCC

00:34:15.310 --> 00:34:19.120 align:middle line:10%
to study climate change
at much deeper, in greater

00:34:19.120 --> 00:34:22.120 align:middle line:10%
depth and detail, I
thought, yes, we need that.

00:34:22.120 --> 00:34:24.290 align:middle line:10%
We need to know what's
going on with this.

00:34:24.290 --> 00:34:26.500 align:middle line:10%
Well, you can
understand, I hope,

00:34:26.500 --> 00:34:29.530 align:middle line:10%
why I was dismayed when I
realized that this was not

00:34:29.530 --> 00:34:30.710 align:middle line:10%
going to be about science.

00:34:30.710 --> 00:34:32.960 align:middle line:10%
This was actually a
political institution.

00:34:32.960 --> 00:34:36.230 align:middle line:10%
And they had a preset agenda,
which is easily demonstrable.

00:34:36.230 --> 00:34:38.889 align:middle line:10%
They had a preset
agenda to demonstrate

00:34:38.889 --> 00:34:42.800 align:middle line:10%
the anthropogenic component
exclusively on climate change.

00:34:42.800 --> 00:34:45.520 align:middle line:10%
And basically, the
stuff that Hermann Flohn

00:34:45.520 --> 00:34:47.770 align:middle line:10%
is saying that we really
need to be studying

00:34:47.770 --> 00:34:50.690 align:middle line:10%
got shunted off to the side.

00:34:50.690 --> 00:34:53.670 align:middle line:84%
Most people don't know
this, and it's important

00:34:53.670 --> 00:34:54.610 align:middle line:90%
that we do know this.

00:34:54.610 --> 00:34:58.210 align:middle line:84%
And here's something that
I think may even shock you.

00:34:58.210 --> 00:34:59.860 align:middle line:90%
This is the last 10,000 years.

00:34:59.860 --> 00:35:01.843 align:middle line:90%
This is based upon ice cores.

00:35:01.843 --> 00:35:04.260 align:middle line:84%
What this showing here, the
graph of the last 10,000 years

00:35:04.260 --> 00:35:06.990 align:middle line:84%
of temperature change is
preserved in Greenland ice cores

00:35:06.990 --> 00:35:10.740 align:middle line:84%
shows temperature and constantly
and repeatedly warming

00:35:10.740 --> 00:35:13.420 align:middle line:84%
and cooling 2 to 3
Fahrenheit or more.

00:35:13.420 --> 00:35:16.630 align:middle line:84%
So what you're seeing
here is not a smooth line.

00:35:16.630 --> 00:35:17.980 align:middle line:90%
It's a jagged line.

00:35:17.980 --> 00:35:20.590 align:middle line:84%
It's constantly upping
and downing as much as 2

00:35:20.590 --> 00:35:22.200 align:middle line:90%
to 3 degrees.

00:35:22.200 --> 00:35:24.250 align:middle line:10%
Colder, warmer, colder, warmer.

00:35:24.250 --> 00:35:29.530 align:middle line:10%
And this we can see reflected in
many proxies from the Holocene.

00:35:29.530 --> 00:35:31.360 align:middle line:10%
And here's where it
gets interesting.

00:35:31.360 --> 00:35:36.227 align:middle line:10%
If we go back beyond the
Holocene into the Pleistocene,

00:35:36.227 --> 00:35:38.060 align:middle line:10%
now bear in mind what
we're looking at here.

00:35:38.060 --> 00:35:40.268 align:middle line:84%
If you look at this closely,
you'll see, for example,

00:35:40.268 --> 00:35:42.200 align:middle line:84%
there's a spike of
cold right here.

00:35:42.200 --> 00:35:45.910 align:middle line:84%
That spike of cold would be
enough to pretty much terminate

00:35:45.910 --> 00:35:48.260 align:middle line:84%
modern civilization
as we know it.

00:35:48.260 --> 00:35:49.060 align:middle line:90%
Why?

00:35:49.060 --> 00:35:53.190 align:middle line:84%
Because that spike of cold was
3 or 4 degrees colder than now.

00:35:53.190 --> 00:35:54.990 align:middle line:90%
It lasted for several years.

00:35:54.990 --> 00:35:56.740 align:middle line:10%
If something like that
were to happen now,

00:35:56.740 --> 00:35:58.323 align:middle line:10%
it means that for
those several years,

00:35:58.323 --> 00:36:01.570 align:middle line:10%
you'd have major global
agricultural collapses.

00:36:01.570 --> 00:36:04.660 align:middle line:10%
And within two to
three years, people

00:36:04.660 --> 00:36:06.400 align:middle line:10%
would be starving to death.

00:36:06.400 --> 00:36:10.150 align:middle line:10%
And by getting weak
because of hunger,

00:36:10.150 --> 00:36:12.020 align:middle line:10%
their immune systems get weak.

00:36:12.020 --> 00:36:14.830 align:middle line:10%
And that's why you always say
that the ancients have told

00:36:14.830 --> 00:36:16.690 align:middle line:10%
us pestilence follows famine.

00:36:16.690 --> 00:36:20.630 align:middle line:10%
Because pestilence is when you
have weakened immune systems,

00:36:20.630 --> 00:36:23.920 align:middle line:10%
that creates the opportunity
for infectious diseases

00:36:23.920 --> 00:36:25.390 align:middle line:10%
to spread rapidly.

00:36:25.390 --> 00:36:31.130 align:middle line:84%
And so that right there is
about a 2 to 3-degree cooling.

00:36:31.130 --> 00:36:32.910 align:middle line:84%
Actually, maybe even
4 degrees cooling.

00:36:32.910 --> 00:36:34.358 align:middle line:90%
It lasted maybe up to a decade.

00:36:34.358 --> 00:36:35.900 align:middle line:10%
Something like that
would happen now,

00:36:35.900 --> 00:36:38.910 align:middle line:10%
we'd be profoundly stressed.

00:36:38.910 --> 00:36:41.040 align:middle line:10%
But I want you to look at
something when we go back

00:36:41.040 --> 00:36:43.600 align:middle line:10%
into the Pleistocene.

00:36:43.600 --> 00:36:46.215 align:middle line:84%
Here's the same graph, and
I'm going to extend it back.

00:36:46.215 --> 00:36:50.280 align:middle line:90%


00:36:50.280 --> 00:36:55.520 align:middle line:10%
If you tell me that the
climate science has settled,

00:36:55.520 --> 00:36:58.290 align:middle line:10%
I'm going to demand that
you explain this to me.

00:36:58.290 --> 00:37:00.540 align:middle line:10%
This graph right here.

00:37:00.540 --> 00:37:02.730 align:middle line:10%
We're looking at
temperature changes

00:37:02.730 --> 00:37:06.660 align:middle line:10%
of up to 10 and 12
degrees centigrade, which

00:37:06.660 --> 00:37:09.520 align:middle line:10%
is up to 18 degrees
Fahrenheit-- guess what--

00:37:09.520 --> 00:37:12.653 align:middle line:10%
in less than five years, maybe
even less than three years.

00:37:12.653 --> 00:37:14.070 align:middle line:84%
And, in fact, some
of the evidence

00:37:14.070 --> 00:37:16.028 align:middle line:84%
suggests that some of
these temperature changes

00:37:16.028 --> 00:37:19.990 align:middle line:90%
occurred within one year.

00:37:19.990 --> 00:37:23.170 align:middle line:10%
I think it's imperative that we
come to a deeper understanding

00:37:23.170 --> 00:37:25.880 align:middle line:10%
of what's going on here.

00:37:25.880 --> 00:37:29.330 align:middle line:84%
Because this is the record of
the last couple of 100,000 years

00:37:29.330 --> 00:37:30.380 align:middle line:90%
on Earth.

00:37:30.380 --> 00:37:34.900 align:middle line:84%
And this is the world that our
ancestors were surviving in.

00:37:34.900 --> 00:37:37.390 align:middle line:84%
"From measurements of annual
ice-layer thickness over

00:37:37.390 --> 00:37:39.820 align:middle line:84%
the past 15,000 years,
the authors find that

00:37:39.820 --> 00:37:42.490 align:middle line:84%
Greenland's climate, emerging
from the last ice age,

00:37:42.490 --> 00:37:46.660 align:middle line:84%
twice shifted from glacial to
interglacial conditions over

00:37:46.660 --> 00:37:52.120 align:middle line:84%
an astonishingly quick
three to five years."

00:37:52.120 --> 00:37:55.060 align:middle line:10%
And here this is
just a large part

00:37:55.060 --> 00:37:56.770 align:middle line:10%
of the graph we just looked at.

00:37:56.770 --> 00:38:00.010 align:middle line:10%
And you'll see that there are
two shifts to the left are cold,

00:38:00.010 --> 00:38:02.870 align:middle line:10%
shifts to the right are warm.

00:38:02.870 --> 00:38:07.210 align:middle line:10%
You're going to see that we
have two extreme warming events.

00:38:07.210 --> 00:38:11.230 align:middle line:10%
The lower one is meltwater pulse
associated with meltwater pulse

00:38:11.230 --> 00:38:15.580 align:middle line:10%
1B, which is probably related
to something that occurred with

00:38:15.580 --> 00:38:16.520 align:middle line:10%
the sun.

00:38:16.520 --> 00:38:19.720 align:middle line:10%
The second one is
the Younger Dryas.

00:38:19.720 --> 00:38:22.300 align:middle line:10%
Actually, the end
of the Younger Dryas

00:38:22.300 --> 00:38:24.700 align:middle line:10%
and the subsidence
of Plato's Atlantis,

00:38:24.700 --> 00:38:27.050 align:middle line:10%
that second red arrow there.

00:38:27.050 --> 00:38:29.770 align:middle line:10%
And those two
warming events were

00:38:29.770 --> 00:38:35.180 align:middle line:10%
associated with two very rapid
melting of the ice sheets,

00:38:35.180 --> 00:38:38.690 align:middle line:10%
extraordinarily and extreme
catastrophic climatic

00:38:38.690 --> 00:38:41.360 align:middle line:10%
and weather events
that were compressed

00:38:41.360 --> 00:38:44.360 align:middle line:10%
within that narrow
window, which I submit

00:38:44.360 --> 00:38:47.060 align:middle line:10%
led to things like
torrential rain

00:38:47.060 --> 00:38:49.980 align:middle line:10%
falls that might have
lasted for weeks at a time.

00:38:49.980 --> 00:38:54.770 align:middle line:10%
And I've taken many people
out on tours and excursions

00:38:54.770 --> 00:38:57.650 align:middle line:10%
to teach them and show
them, reveal to them

00:38:57.650 --> 00:39:00.800 align:middle line:10%
the evidence of this kind
of events in the landscape

00:39:00.800 --> 00:39:04.350 align:middle line:10%
because the landscapes have
preserved this evidence for us.

00:39:04.350 --> 00:39:05.150 align:middle line:10%
I've gone.

00:39:05.150 --> 00:39:08.630 align:middle line:10%
I've-- in fact, my previous
trips to Las Vegas was because I

00:39:08.630 --> 00:39:11.600 align:middle line:10%
was using Vegas as a jumping off
point to go out, for example,

00:39:11.600 --> 00:39:13.110 align:middle line:10%
into the Mojave Desert.

00:39:13.110 --> 00:39:15.200 align:middle line:10%
And I've taken groups
out there to show

00:39:15.200 --> 00:39:19.070 align:middle line:10%
that the imprint of
gigantic, catastrophic events

00:39:19.070 --> 00:39:22.250 align:middle line:10%
like torrential rain falls,
biblical scale rainfalls,

00:39:22.250 --> 00:39:25.730 align:middle line:10%
have left their imprints in the
deserts of the United States.

00:39:25.730 --> 00:39:29.080 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:39:29.080 --> 00:39:33.000 align:middle line:90%
