00:00:04.473 --> 00:00:07.952 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:07.952 --> 00:00:12.440 align:middle line:90%


00:00:12.440 --> 00:00:15.290 align:middle line:10%
>> Yep, I'm going there.

00:00:15.290 --> 00:00:19.550 align:middle line:10%
I'm talking about
bathroom dreams right now.

00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:22.470 align:middle line:84%
I thought that nobody
had bathroom dreams,

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:26.270 align:middle line:84%
and then it turns out lots of
people have bathroom dreams.

00:00:26.270 --> 00:00:28.430 align:middle line:84%
So I was hiding this
my whole life, the fact

00:00:28.430 --> 00:00:29.520 align:middle line:90%
that I was having them.

00:00:29.520 --> 00:00:33.390 align:middle line:90%
But I was having so many.

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:37.040 align:middle line:84%
And even now, to this day,
almost all of my dreams

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:39.030 align:middle line:84%
are attached to
a bathroom dream.

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:40.800 align:middle line:90%
It's really crazy.

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:46.830 align:middle line:10%
But my point will be, lean
into the recurring dreams.

00:00:46.830 --> 00:00:48.260 align:middle line:10%
Watch them.

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:53.040 align:middle line:10%
Put that audit on the recurring
dreams and see, when you do,

00:00:53.040 --> 00:00:54.740 align:middle line:10%
if they start moving.

00:00:54.740 --> 00:00:59.030 align:middle line:10%
If they've always been
solid, see if that pressure

00:00:59.030 --> 00:01:01.110 align:middle line:10%
starts changing them.

00:01:01.110 --> 00:01:03.330 align:middle line:10%
And then what are the changes?

00:01:03.330 --> 00:01:07.860 align:middle line:10%
So for me, they started very
decrepit and weird and isolated.

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:11.080 align:middle line:10%
But there's some really
interesting observations

00:01:11.080 --> 00:01:11.880 align:middle line:10%
about them.

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:15.120 align:middle line:10%
They have really evolved,
and we definitely

00:01:15.120 --> 00:01:16.710 align:middle line:10%
take these for granted.

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:20.590 align:middle line:10%
But, yes, hundreds.

00:01:20.590 --> 00:01:21.390 align:middle line:10%
OK?

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:22.682 align:middle line:10%
I've had hundreds and hundreds.

00:01:22.682 --> 00:01:25.490 align:middle line:10%
Probably more than that, because
it's happened my entire life.

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:30.470 align:middle line:84%
There has never been one
that has ever been the same.

00:01:30.470 --> 00:01:33.530 align:middle line:10%
And there has never
been one that I've ever

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:36.260 align:middle line:10%
seen in real life, ever.

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:38.450 align:middle line:10%
So what about that?

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:39.920 align:middle line:10%
What is that?

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:42.410 align:middle line:10%
They fascinate me.

00:01:42.410 --> 00:01:45.180 align:middle line:10%
I've probably seen one that
looks like a real bathroom.

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:47.480 align:middle line:10%
I'm going to say five,
just to give it a couple

00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:49.280 align:middle line:10%
extras that maybe I forgot.

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:53.720 align:middle line:10%
But they don't look
anything like--

00:01:53.720 --> 00:01:56.270 align:middle line:10%
I go into there knowing
it's a bathroom,

00:01:56.270 --> 00:01:58.380 align:middle line:10%
but it never looks like one.

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:00.530 align:middle line:10%
Everything is so unusual.

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:02.480 align:middle line:10%
Now I'm at the
point where I go in,

00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:05.700 align:middle line:10%
and I'm kind of excited
to see what it looks like.

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:09.680 align:middle line:10%
And the goal is to
bring more awareness

00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:13.440 align:middle line:10%
to see if it's
really a bathroom.

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:16.760 align:middle line:84%
It wasn't until I had one,
probably in the last year,

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:21.020 align:middle line:84%
that I started to have a feeling
as I was looking around it.

00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:25.430 align:middle line:84%
My lucid level was
rising, in hindsight.

00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:28.370 align:middle line:84%
I started to really
observe it, and I started

00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:31.520 align:middle line:90%
to wonder inside my dream.

00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:34.830 align:middle line:10%
I wasn't having a lucid dream,
but I was having more lucidity.

00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:39.540 align:middle line:10%
And I was wondering, is
this really a bathroom?

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:44.690 align:middle line:10%
And ever since I started
wondering that, in the dream,

00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:46.840 align:middle line:10%
more things have
started happening.

00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:50.480 align:middle line:10%
My last one, I was in
an elevator that took me

00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:52.380 align:middle line:10%
into a plane that was flying.

00:02:52.380 --> 00:02:58.550 align:middle line:10%
So I started to think, is this a
doorway that we could be using?

00:02:58.550 --> 00:02:59.542 align:middle line:10%
What is this?

00:02:59.542 --> 00:03:01.250 align:middle line:10%
So this is why I like
to encourage people

00:03:01.250 --> 00:03:05.630 align:middle line:10%
to look at the mundane, what you
think is mundane in your dreams,

00:03:05.630 --> 00:03:09.350 align:middle line:10%
and start looking at it
from different directions.

00:03:09.350 --> 00:03:14.340 align:middle line:10%
Is it like quantum physics where
this is all about the observer?

00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:18.210 align:middle line:10%
Observe it and see how
that wave breaks down.

00:03:18.210 --> 00:03:21.110 align:middle line:10%
What does it break into?

00:03:21.110 --> 00:03:23.610 align:middle line:10%
I think it's
something we overlook.

00:03:23.610 --> 00:03:26.240 align:middle line:10%
And I invite you to have
a good look at what's

00:03:26.240 --> 00:03:27.510 align:middle line:10%
happening in your own.

00:03:27.510 --> 00:03:29.040 align:middle line:10%
This picture is hilarious.

00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:30.840 align:middle line:10%
I have always been
compelled to experiment,

00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:32.540 align:middle line:10%
like I was saying,
using the protocols

00:03:32.540 --> 00:03:35.810 align:middle line:10%
that I learned from controlled
remote viewing, left-right brain

00:03:35.810 --> 00:03:37.770 align:middle line:10%
research, all sorts of things.

00:03:37.770 --> 00:03:39.740 align:middle line:84%
Split-brain studies,
I'm fascinated with.

00:03:39.740 --> 00:03:42.480 align:middle line:84%
And I just was
clarifying my intent

00:03:42.480 --> 00:03:44.770 align:middle line:90%
and increasing meditation time.

00:03:44.770 --> 00:03:46.240 align:middle line:90%
It's really helpful.

00:03:46.240 --> 00:03:48.630 align:middle line:84%
I can't explain why, but
I think you're spending

00:03:48.630 --> 00:03:50.830 align:middle line:90%
more time in that brain state.

00:03:50.830 --> 00:03:54.970 align:middle line:10%
And so it just seems to be a
bit of an amplifier for dreams.

00:03:54.970 --> 00:03:56.790 align:middle line:90%
Better tracking in your dreams.

00:03:56.790 --> 00:03:59.880 align:middle line:84%
If you're going to do this,
you want to watch your tracking

00:03:59.880 --> 00:04:02.020 align:middle line:84%
and just get a little
bit better at a time.

00:04:02.020 --> 00:04:03.660 align:middle line:84%
I know it's a lot
of work sometimes.

00:04:03.660 --> 00:04:06.180 align:middle line:10%
But here's a great thing,
a tool, that I learned,

00:04:06.180 --> 00:04:08.340 align:middle line:10%
and this was from the book
"Dreaming on Both Sides

00:04:08.340 --> 00:04:11.480 align:middle line:10%
of the Brain" by
Doris Eliana Cohen.

00:04:11.480 --> 00:04:13.760 align:middle line:84%
Dream headlines-- so
just like a newspaper has

00:04:13.760 --> 00:04:16.680 align:middle line:84%
a headline-- it's really hard
to go back in all your dreams

00:04:16.680 --> 00:04:17.480 align:middle line:90%
and find them.

00:04:17.480 --> 00:04:20.040 align:middle line:84%
So make it easier to
categorize them for yourself.

00:04:20.040 --> 00:04:22.280 align:middle line:84%
Write a dream headline
with the main theme

00:04:22.280 --> 00:04:23.870 align:middle line:90%
and write a couple points.

00:04:23.870 --> 00:04:27.680 align:middle line:10%
I'm at the point now where I
have to voice-record them when I

00:04:27.680 --> 00:04:29.930 align:middle line:10%
wake up, and then I write them.

00:04:29.930 --> 00:04:32.850 align:middle line:10%
Because memories change.

00:04:32.850 --> 00:04:33.740 align:middle line:10%
You want it fresh.

00:04:33.740 --> 00:04:34.540 align:middle line:10%
Right?

00:04:34.540 --> 00:04:36.410 align:middle line:10%
So when you get up, if you can--

00:04:36.410 --> 00:04:37.797 align:middle line:10%
I don't even move
out of the bed.

00:04:37.797 --> 00:04:39.630 align:middle line:10%
I voice-record it, and
then I write it down.

00:04:39.630 --> 00:04:41.880 align:middle line:10%
And sometimes I can't even
remember half of the things

00:04:41.880 --> 00:04:43.320 align:middle line:10%
by the time I write it down.

00:04:43.320 --> 00:04:45.560 align:middle line:10%
So that's important.

00:04:45.560 --> 00:04:47.720 align:middle line:10%
And I started getting
immediate results

00:04:47.720 --> 00:04:49.500 align:middle line:10%
from this little
bit of pressure.

00:04:49.500 --> 00:04:52.400 align:middle line:10%
I got new and different types
of dreams, emotional matches.

00:04:52.400 --> 00:04:55.370 align:middle line:10%
Emotional matches, to me
now, looking back, are like,

00:04:55.370 --> 00:04:58.147 align:middle line:10%
you're starting to see a little
bit of precognition happening.

00:04:58.147 --> 00:05:00.230 align:middle line:10%
I'm just going to tell you
a little bit about this

00:05:00.230 --> 00:05:01.030 align:middle line:10%
because it's funny.

00:05:01.030 --> 00:05:03.020 align:middle line:10%
One of my best friends
is here, and she

00:05:03.020 --> 00:05:05.330 align:middle line:10%
was in one of the
dreams that really made

00:05:05.330 --> 00:05:08.100 align:middle line:10%
me recognize what this was.

00:05:08.100 --> 00:05:13.710 align:middle line:10%
All it is is I started
noticing that a dream might

00:05:13.710 --> 00:05:15.755 align:middle line:10%
have an emotional peak in it.

00:05:15.755 --> 00:05:17.040 align:middle line:10%
OK?

00:05:17.040 --> 00:05:19.690 align:middle line:10%
So in this dream, she
and I were driving,

00:05:19.690 --> 00:05:22.110 align:middle line:10%
and she was driving
crazy, recklessly.

00:05:22.110 --> 00:05:24.940 align:middle line:10%
And I was saying, hey, slow
down, and she wouldn't.

00:05:24.940 --> 00:05:29.220 align:middle line:10%
And I had to keep raising
myself to a level I'm not

00:05:29.220 --> 00:05:30.400 align:middle line:10%
used to using.

00:05:30.400 --> 00:05:35.200 align:middle line:84%
I had to get really loud and
upset to get her to stop.

00:05:35.200 --> 00:05:36.310 align:middle line:10%
And then she listened.

00:05:36.310 --> 00:05:38.710 align:middle line:10%
What played out during the day?

00:05:38.710 --> 00:05:41.340 align:middle line:84%
That day I had a
situation with my dog.

00:05:41.340 --> 00:05:42.180 align:middle line:90%
I'm painting.

00:05:42.180 --> 00:05:43.900 align:middle line:84%
My hands are in all
sorts of things.

00:05:43.900 --> 00:05:46.200 align:middle line:84%
And my dog is happily
wagging her tail

00:05:46.200 --> 00:05:49.120 align:middle line:84%
and chewing my computer cord
like it's the greatest thing.

00:05:49.120 --> 00:05:52.150 align:middle line:84%
And so I go through this
process, because I love her.

00:05:52.150 --> 00:05:54.805 align:middle line:90%
And I couldn't.

00:05:54.805 --> 00:05:55.930 align:middle line:90%
I was like, hey, stop that.

00:05:55.930 --> 00:05:57.340 align:middle line:90%
She wags, wags, wags.

00:05:57.340 --> 00:06:01.280 align:middle line:84%
And so I had to escalate to this
level that hurt me to do it,

00:06:01.280 --> 00:06:02.080 align:middle line:90%
to get like that.

00:06:02.080 --> 00:06:06.300 align:middle line:10%
So the context was different,
but these emotional peaks

00:06:06.300 --> 00:06:07.570 align:middle line:10%
matched.

00:06:07.570 --> 00:06:10.320 align:middle line:10%
And I think if you
start looking for this,

00:06:10.320 --> 00:06:12.150 align:middle line:10%
you'll see that it's there.

00:06:12.150 --> 00:06:14.110 align:middle line:10%
You'll see that it's there.

00:06:14.110 --> 00:06:17.430 align:middle line:10%
So, again, this is
part of the self-audit.

00:06:17.430 --> 00:06:18.450 align:middle line:10%
Sequence dreams.

00:06:18.450 --> 00:06:21.780 align:middle line:10%
If you start noticing--

00:06:21.780 --> 00:06:24.300 align:middle line:10%
sometimes you'll have three
dreams in a row, four dreams,

00:06:24.300 --> 00:06:25.850 align:middle line:10%
five dreams in a row--

00:06:25.850 --> 00:06:26.990 align:middle line:10%
write it down.

00:06:26.990 --> 00:06:28.860 align:middle line:90%
Say, I think sequence dream.

00:06:28.860 --> 00:06:30.840 align:middle line:90%
Then start getting other ones.

00:06:30.840 --> 00:06:34.250 align:middle line:10%
You can start to
compare the first dreams

00:06:34.250 --> 00:06:36.990 align:middle line:10%
and the fifth dreams
and the third dreams,

00:06:36.990 --> 00:06:40.640 align:middle line:10%
and you will start to
see some similarities,

00:06:40.640 --> 00:06:44.670 align:middle line:10%
like the lucidity level,
how surreal they are.

00:06:44.670 --> 00:06:47.130 align:middle line:10%
Again, there's
these amazing clues.

00:06:47.130 --> 00:06:49.680 align:middle line:10%
The more you look, the
more it starts opening up.

00:06:49.680 --> 00:06:52.080 align:middle line:10%
I started having déjà
vu inside my dreams.

00:06:52.080 --> 00:06:53.330 align:middle line:10%
That was crazy.

00:06:53.330 --> 00:06:55.760 align:middle line:10%
I was discussing the
fact that I was dreaming

00:06:55.760 --> 00:06:57.480 align:middle line:10%
with people I was walking with.

00:06:57.480 --> 00:07:00.300 align:middle line:10%
I was telling people what was
about to unfold in the dream.

00:07:00.300 --> 00:07:01.950 align:middle line:10%
It wasn't like. oh, there's a
balloon that's going to fly.

00:07:01.950 --> 00:07:02.750 align:middle line:10%
No.

00:07:02.750 --> 00:07:05.240 align:middle line:84%
I was describing
a whole scenario

00:07:05.240 --> 00:07:07.050 align:middle line:90%
and then watched it play out.

00:07:07.050 --> 00:07:11.100 align:middle line:10%
So there was this
ever-increasing awareness.

00:07:11.100 --> 00:07:13.120 align:middle line:10%
And I just want to say this.

00:07:13.120 --> 00:07:17.020 align:middle line:84%
A lot of times we get hung-up
on, I have to lucid-dream for it

00:07:17.020 --> 00:07:18.220 align:middle line:90%
to be good.

00:07:18.220 --> 00:07:20.170 align:middle line:84%
I need to learn
how to lucid-dream.

00:07:20.170 --> 00:07:22.370 align:middle line:90%
And you don't.

00:07:22.370 --> 00:07:26.343 align:middle line:10%
A very small percentage of
people actually really fully

00:07:26.343 --> 00:07:28.010 align:middle line:10%
lucid-dream and can
change their dreams.

00:07:28.010 --> 00:07:30.260 align:middle line:10%
It's 20% or something like that.

00:07:30.260 --> 00:07:36.730 align:middle line:84%
But what you can aim for is
just more global awareness.

00:07:36.730 --> 00:07:39.910 align:middle line:10%
That's more like it.

00:07:39.910 --> 00:07:43.480 align:middle line:10%
There's kind of a bonus
to not going lucid,

00:07:43.480 --> 00:07:48.670 align:middle line:10%
because you start to see that
you're not exactly running it.

00:07:48.670 --> 00:07:50.380 align:middle line:10%
In a lucid dream,
you're in control,

00:07:50.380 --> 00:07:52.310 align:middle line:10%
and you're changing everything.

00:07:52.310 --> 00:07:55.810 align:middle line:10%
But when you have a
profound dream that

00:07:55.810 --> 00:07:58.120 align:middle line:10%
ends up being precognitive,
it's kind of good

00:07:58.120 --> 00:07:59.780 align:middle line:10%
that it wasn't lucid.

00:07:59.780 --> 00:08:01.310 align:middle line:10%
It's different.

00:08:01.310 --> 00:08:06.280 align:middle line:10%
You learn, wow, OK,
I didn't create that.

00:08:06.280 --> 00:08:08.000 align:middle line:10%
Consciously, I
didn't create that.

00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:10.690 align:middle line:10%
That's a powerful
tool to observe.

00:08:10.690 --> 00:08:14.730 align:middle line:10%
In 2023, in the summer, I
was going to do a lecture,

00:08:14.730 --> 00:08:17.350 align:middle line:10%
and so I wanted to do
another experiment on myself.

00:08:17.350 --> 00:08:19.890 align:middle line:90%
I did it for about a month.

00:08:19.890 --> 00:08:22.260 align:middle line:84%
Always make it for a
short amount of time.

00:08:22.260 --> 00:08:23.670 align:middle line:90%
It'll be more sustainable.

00:08:23.670 --> 00:08:24.920 align:middle line:90%
You'll be able to do it again.

00:08:24.920 --> 00:08:28.230 align:middle line:84%
The number one thing that
made the most difference--

00:08:28.230 --> 00:08:31.370 align:middle line:84%
it's crazy-- I changed
my sleep radically.

00:08:31.370 --> 00:08:33.629 align:middle line:84%
So I made sure that
I got up pre-dawn.

00:08:33.629 --> 00:08:34.429 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:08:34.429 --> 00:08:36.390 align:middle line:10%
This was one of the
most important things.

00:08:36.390 --> 00:08:39.919 align:middle line:10%
And it didn't matter if I
couldn't sleep till 2:00 or I

00:08:39.919 --> 00:08:42.890 align:middle line:10%
went to bed at 10:00 or I
went to bed at 8:00, whatever.

00:08:42.890 --> 00:08:46.890 align:middle line:10%
I was going to get up at 4:00
or some time super early.

00:08:46.890 --> 00:08:52.790 align:middle line:10%
And if my sleep broke, if I went
to sleep at 10:00 and I got up

00:08:52.790 --> 00:08:56.680 align:middle line:10%
at 2:00, I was ready for this.

00:08:56.680 --> 00:08:57.680 align:middle line:10%
I wanted to accept that.

00:08:57.680 --> 00:09:01.160 align:middle line:84%
Because if I had a dream
during the dream experiment,

00:09:01.160 --> 00:09:03.530 align:middle line:84%
you are committing that
every time you have a dream,

00:09:03.530 --> 00:09:04.950 align:middle line:90%
you are recording that dream.

00:09:04.950 --> 00:09:08.510 align:middle line:10%
So if it happens at 2:00, I am
recording that and getting up

00:09:08.510 --> 00:09:11.130 align:middle line:10%
and writing it down, and
then I'll go back to sleep.

00:09:11.130 --> 00:09:14.360 align:middle line:10%
So I had broken sleep
cycles, but I would always

00:09:14.360 --> 00:09:16.310 align:middle line:10%
make sure I would
allow naps for myself

00:09:16.310 --> 00:09:17.790 align:middle line:10%
to catch up during the day.

00:09:17.790 --> 00:09:22.790 align:middle line:10%
But what started happening
was every single break

00:09:22.790 --> 00:09:26.030 align:middle line:10%
of sleep produced dreams.

00:09:26.030 --> 00:09:29.150 align:middle line:10%
It was amazing for
a dream experiment,

00:09:29.150 --> 00:09:30.758 align:middle line:10%
I had to voice-record.

00:09:30.758 --> 00:09:32.300 align:middle line:10%
If you do something
like this, you've

00:09:32.300 --> 00:09:34.880 align:middle line:10%
got to voice-record as well.

00:09:34.880 --> 00:09:37.130 align:middle line:10%
Priming the mental
space at night.

00:09:37.130 --> 00:09:40.550 align:middle line:10%
Part of this is what I'd
say in the next point,

00:09:40.550 --> 00:09:42.582 align:middle line:10%
moving all evening
activities earlier.

00:09:42.582 --> 00:09:44.540 align:middle line:10%
So if Richard and I were
having dinner at 8:00,

00:09:44.540 --> 00:09:47.660 align:middle line:10%
during this experiment, I highly
recommend you want to move

00:09:47.660 --> 00:09:48.590 align:middle line:10%
everything to 5:00.

00:09:48.590 --> 00:09:53.510 align:middle line:10%
Because we all like our
YouTube research and our shows

00:09:53.510 --> 00:09:55.890 align:middle line:10%
and whatever to
decompress from the day.

00:09:55.890 --> 00:09:58.190 align:middle line:10%
You want to move
all of this earlier

00:09:58.190 --> 00:10:01.240 align:middle line:10%
because right now your
priorities are your dreams.

00:10:01.240 --> 00:10:02.040 align:middle line:10%
Right?

00:10:02.040 --> 00:10:04.275 align:middle line:84%
So just for this
time, move everything.

00:10:04.275 --> 00:10:05.400 align:middle line:90%
You don't want to taint it.

00:10:05.400 --> 00:10:08.280 align:middle line:90%
You are here to learn about you.

00:10:08.280 --> 00:10:10.190 align:middle line:84%
So all of those
things, you take it,

00:10:10.190 --> 00:10:14.000 align:middle line:84%
you do it around your new dinner
time during the experiment.

00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:16.460 align:middle line:10%
Morning process,
early rise attitude.

00:10:16.460 --> 00:10:18.540 align:middle line:10%
This is part of doing
psychological experiments

00:10:18.540 --> 00:10:19.340 align:middle line:10%
on yourself.

00:10:19.340 --> 00:10:20.830 align:middle line:10%
I've done a lot of
blindfolded work

00:10:20.830 --> 00:10:23.020 align:middle line:10%
and all sorts of crazy
stuff, and it all

00:10:23.020 --> 00:10:26.680 align:middle line:10%
comes down to
conviction, a decision

00:10:26.680 --> 00:10:32.920 align:middle line:10%
that you make inside yourself
that this is important to you.

00:10:32.920 --> 00:10:35.560 align:middle line:10%
One of the things in my
degree is health psychology

00:10:35.560 --> 00:10:37.190 align:middle line:10%
and the psychology of change.

00:10:37.190 --> 00:10:40.270 align:middle line:10%
And I will tell you, if you have
a list of what you want to do,

00:10:40.270 --> 00:10:44.820 align:middle line:10%
it's highly unlikely you
probably, sadly, will fulfill it

00:10:44.820 --> 00:10:45.620 align:middle line:10%
and do it.

00:10:45.620 --> 00:10:52.450 align:middle line:10%
But if you tell yourself,
why do I want to do this?

00:10:52.450 --> 00:10:55.067 align:middle line:84%
Seriously, people want
to meditate all the time,

00:10:55.067 --> 00:10:56.150 align:middle line:90%
and they're like, I can't.

00:10:56.150 --> 00:10:56.950 align:middle line:90%
I can't.

00:10:56.950 --> 00:10:58.330 align:middle line:10%
You haven't had
that conversation

00:10:58.330 --> 00:11:01.370 align:middle line:10%
with yourself of why
it means so much.

00:11:01.370 --> 00:11:03.650 align:middle line:10%
Because if it really does,
you're going to do this.

00:11:03.650 --> 00:11:06.620 align:middle line:10%
So for me, I know why
I want to do this.

00:11:06.620 --> 00:11:08.230 align:middle line:10%
And you write down
on your mirror,

00:11:08.230 --> 00:11:10.390 align:middle line:10%
instead of your list,
what you want to do

00:11:10.390 --> 00:11:12.862 align:middle line:10%
or your affirmations--
you write down why.

00:11:12.862 --> 00:11:15.060 align:middle line:10%
Why is that so important to you?

00:11:15.060 --> 00:11:18.380 align:middle line:10%
And when I get up at 4:00 and
I'm like, nope, I remind myself,

00:11:18.380 --> 00:11:19.800 align:middle line:10%
no, I want this.

00:11:19.800 --> 00:11:22.610 align:middle line:10%
And I go and I see why,
and I'm like, yeah.

00:11:22.610 --> 00:11:24.740 align:middle line:10%
I want to explore this mind.

00:11:24.740 --> 00:11:27.470 align:middle line:10%
I am not going to
die not knowing

00:11:27.470 --> 00:11:30.950 align:middle line:10%
how far my brain could go.

00:11:30.950 --> 00:11:31.940 align:middle line:10%
No.

00:11:31.940 --> 00:11:36.620 align:middle line:84%
what can we do with
these Ferraris in here?

00:11:36.620 --> 00:11:40.040 align:middle line:90%
So here's another thing.

00:11:40.040 --> 00:11:41.310 align:middle line:90%
I made a new workspace.

00:11:41.310 --> 00:11:43.230 align:middle line:84%
I'm just making these
suggestions for you.

00:11:43.230 --> 00:11:47.000 align:middle line:10%
If you're going to be getting
up in the middle of the night,

00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:49.490 align:middle line:10%
make a desk.

00:11:49.490 --> 00:11:50.840 align:middle line:10%
Clear it off at night.

00:11:50.840 --> 00:11:55.130 align:middle line:10%
Change the lighting to
something very light, subtle,

00:11:55.130 --> 00:11:58.650 align:middle line:10%
like candlelight, something
that you're going to feel good.

00:11:58.650 --> 00:11:59.730 align:middle line:10%
It won't be jarring.

00:11:59.730 --> 00:12:02.870 align:middle line:10%
Make this easy on
yourself for this part.

00:12:02.870 --> 00:12:05.370 align:middle line:84%
The evening was really
preparing this ritual.

00:12:05.370 --> 00:12:07.100 align:middle line:90%
I call it the morning mystic.

00:12:07.100 --> 00:12:08.360 align:middle line:90%
Because what you want to do--

00:12:08.360 --> 00:12:10.892 align:middle line:84%
the left brain doesn't
care about your dreams.

00:12:10.892 --> 00:12:12.850 align:middle line:84%
The left brain cares
about getting you to work,

00:12:12.850 --> 00:12:15.380 align:middle line:84%
getting you dressed, getting
you feeling good for the day.

00:12:15.380 --> 00:12:16.338 align:middle line:90%
What am I going to eat?

00:12:16.338 --> 00:12:17.410 align:middle line:90%
This, that, whatever.

00:12:17.410 --> 00:12:20.230 align:middle line:84%
Dreams don't matter
to the left brain.

00:12:20.230 --> 00:12:24.910 align:middle line:84%
So the morning mystic to me
is you're kind of creating--

00:12:24.910 --> 00:12:27.310 align:middle line:84%
instead of these two parts
not caring about each other,

00:12:27.310 --> 00:12:30.070 align:middle line:84%
you're kind of doing
this handshake where

00:12:30.070 --> 00:12:33.370 align:middle line:84%
you are in your
ego space saying,

00:12:33.370 --> 00:12:37.910 align:middle line:84%
I want these two areas
to meet each other.

00:12:37.910 --> 00:12:39.650 align:middle line:90%
I want to bring this together.

00:12:39.650 --> 00:12:41.120 align:middle line:90%
I want to learn.

00:12:41.120 --> 00:12:45.190 align:middle line:84%
And once you start showing it
what you want, it responds.

00:12:45.190 --> 00:12:49.900 align:middle line:84%
So I'm telling you, aligning
that with the 4:00 AM thing,

00:12:49.900 --> 00:12:53.520 align:middle line:84%
getting up super early, was the
biggest thing in the psychology

00:12:53.520 --> 00:12:54.320 align:middle line:90%
of change.

00:12:54.320 --> 00:12:55.580 align:middle line:90%
I just talked about that.

00:12:55.580 --> 00:12:58.000 align:middle line:10%
So I was thinking about
the left-right brain thing,

00:12:58.000 --> 00:13:02.410 align:middle line:10%
and I thought, maybe it would be
useful to think about concepts,

00:13:02.410 --> 00:13:05.110 align:middle line:10%
things that the right
brain kind of really likes,

00:13:05.110 --> 00:13:08.050 align:middle line:10%
like meeting other
aspects of myself,

00:13:08.050 --> 00:13:11.360 align:middle line:10%
future versions of myself,
dimensional versions of myself--

00:13:11.360 --> 00:13:12.830 align:middle line:10%
I love this one--
personification

00:13:12.830 --> 00:13:14.340 align:middle line:10%
of my subconscious mind.

00:13:14.340 --> 00:13:18.020 align:middle line:10%
So I would just sort
of ponder these things

00:13:18.020 --> 00:13:19.310 align:middle line:10%
that were larger than me.

00:13:19.310 --> 00:13:21.890 align:middle line:84%
Or even the sky and
how we're on a speeding

00:13:21.890 --> 00:13:26.120 align:middle line:84%
rock in the middle of space
that's expanding forever.

00:13:26.120 --> 00:13:30.740 align:middle line:84%
Just think about these expansive
things just to give it space.

00:13:30.740 --> 00:13:33.980 align:middle line:10%
So I did all of these things
for this new experiment,

00:13:33.980 --> 00:13:38.700 align:middle line:10%
and the dream world responded
with some new things.

00:13:38.700 --> 00:13:45.540 align:middle line:84%
So I had these things before,
but they were just amplified.

00:13:45.540 --> 00:13:46.640 align:middle line:90%
There was guidance.

00:13:46.640 --> 00:13:47.660 align:middle line:90%
There was teaching.

00:13:47.660 --> 00:13:49.917 align:middle line:90%
There was flying.

00:13:49.917 --> 00:13:51.500 align:middle line:10%
One of the weird
things that happened,

00:13:51.500 --> 00:13:54.440 align:middle line:10%
I was meeting inventors
showing me things.

00:13:54.440 --> 00:13:58.743 align:middle line:10%
And I was going places that
I recognized in dream world.

00:13:58.743 --> 00:14:00.410 align:middle line:10%
And I would be walking
home-- of course,

00:14:00.410 --> 00:14:02.452 align:middle line:10%
there was a bathroom dream
in the middle of this.

00:14:02.452 --> 00:14:04.490 align:middle line:10%
But I was walking
away, and I thought

00:14:04.490 --> 00:14:08.690 align:middle line:10%
I forgot something and then
going back to the university

00:14:08.690 --> 00:14:11.540 align:middle line:10%
that I had just come from, and
it was completely demolished.

00:14:11.540 --> 00:14:15.480 align:middle line:10%
And it was all
drones and robots.

00:14:15.480 --> 00:14:17.870 align:middle line:10%
And then meeting one
of my professors, who

00:14:17.870 --> 00:14:19.670 align:middle line:10%
was showing me this invention.

00:14:19.670 --> 00:14:22.250 align:middle line:10%
He had a backpack on
and these goggles on,

00:14:22.250 --> 00:14:24.650 align:middle line:10%
and the backpack was
going in and out of--

00:14:24.650 --> 00:14:26.820 align:middle line:10%
you couldn't see it.

00:14:26.820 --> 00:14:29.070 align:middle line:10%
It was disappearing,
but it was still there.

00:14:29.070 --> 00:14:32.510 align:middle line:10%
So I was meeting people
who were inventing things.

00:14:32.510 --> 00:14:36.740 align:middle line:10%
Kind of strange, but cool.

00:14:36.740 --> 00:14:40.680 align:middle line:10%
And I have to just tell this
cool story that's not about me.

00:14:40.680 --> 00:14:42.480 align:middle line:10%
Terence McKenna--
I love this story--

00:14:42.480 --> 00:14:47.690 align:middle line:10%
he dreamed of taking DMT and had
a full-blown mystical experience

00:14:47.690 --> 00:14:50.180 align:middle line:10%
in the dream without
ever taking DMT.

00:14:50.180 --> 00:14:51.450 align:middle line:10%
So cool.

00:14:51.450 --> 00:14:54.110 align:middle line:10%
Again, just saying, because
of the limitlessness,

00:14:54.110 --> 00:14:59.150 align:middle line:10%
we have to use our imaginations
to ask for new things.

00:14:59.150 --> 00:15:00.840 align:middle line:10%
So here's some of the results.

00:15:00.840 --> 00:15:04.590 align:middle line:84%
I had increased
questioning going on.

00:15:04.590 --> 00:15:07.910 align:middle line:84%
The dreams were still
running, like autopilot,

00:15:07.910 --> 00:15:13.750 align:middle line:84%
but I was really stopping and
pausing and looking and noticing

00:15:13.750 --> 00:15:14.550 align:middle line:90%
things.

00:15:14.550 --> 00:15:16.730 align:middle line:84%
And I had this higher
level of awareness

00:15:16.730 --> 00:15:18.660 align:middle line:90%
of people and environments.

00:15:18.660 --> 00:15:21.440 align:middle line:84%
Yes, I was seeing the
relationship of my target

00:15:21.440 --> 00:15:22.800 align:middle line:90%
in a dream language.

00:15:22.800 --> 00:15:24.480 align:middle line:90%
Here's an example of this.

00:15:24.480 --> 00:15:28.190 align:middle line:84%
I went to bed saying,
I'm going to put

00:15:28.190 --> 00:15:31.162 align:middle line:84%
a sign on the wall in the
bathroom, when I see a bathroom.

00:15:31.162 --> 00:15:33.620 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to put a sign on the
wall, and it's going to say,

00:15:33.620 --> 00:15:35.790 align:middle line:90%
Tracey, wake up.

00:15:35.790 --> 00:15:38.550 align:middle line:84%
So this is what I imagined
before I went to bed.

00:15:38.550 --> 00:15:40.950 align:middle line:84%
I get in the dream,
and it's running.

00:15:40.950 --> 00:15:45.560 align:middle line:84%
And I remember it was kind
of like a Viking time.

00:15:45.560 --> 00:15:50.420 align:middle line:84%
And I'm looking over at a wall,
and I'm like, oh, there's a map.

00:15:50.420 --> 00:15:52.190 align:middle line:90%
I'm going to this map.

00:15:52.190 --> 00:15:54.020 align:middle line:84%
I don't know why my
attitude was like this.

00:15:54.020 --> 00:15:55.520 align:middle line:90%
But I was looking at the map.

00:15:55.520 --> 00:15:58.110 align:middle line:84%
And this is almost exactly what
it looked like, by the way.

00:15:58.110 --> 00:16:00.500 align:middle line:84%
And I could see all of this
territory, and I was saying,

00:16:00.500 --> 00:16:02.880 align:middle line:90%
I know this place.

00:16:02.880 --> 00:16:05.300 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to conquer
this frontier.

00:16:05.300 --> 00:16:07.980 align:middle line:84%
I will lead us
through this frontier.

00:16:07.980 --> 00:16:10.310 align:middle line:84%
And it had this polar
bear head in the middle,

00:16:10.310 --> 00:16:11.940 align:middle line:90%
which to you means nothing.

00:16:11.940 --> 00:16:16.730 align:middle line:10%
But to me, I have done a lot of
shamanic journeying in my past,

00:16:16.730 --> 00:16:19.700 align:middle line:10%
and for decades,
the polar bear has

00:16:19.700 --> 00:16:22.340 align:middle line:10%
been at the center of
my heart and my being

00:16:22.340 --> 00:16:24.630 align:middle line:10%
and my soul my entire life.

00:16:24.630 --> 00:16:29.870 align:middle line:10%
So it was beautiful for me to
see my left brain intention

00:16:29.870 --> 00:16:33.060 align:middle line:10%
show up in another language,
in a dream language.

00:16:33.060 --> 00:16:36.650 align:middle line:10%
So, again, I'm showing these
things for ideas for you

00:16:36.650 --> 00:16:38.450 align:middle line:10%
to experiment.

00:16:38.450 --> 00:16:43.220 align:middle line:10%
OK, here is the most unexpected
result of the entire experiment.

00:16:43.220 --> 00:16:46.280 align:middle line:84%
I always wanted more
precognitive dreams,

00:16:46.280 --> 00:16:47.580 align:middle line:90%
but I didn't have them.

00:16:47.580 --> 00:16:49.730 align:middle line:84%
They would just happen
once in a while,

00:16:49.730 --> 00:16:55.160 align:middle line:84%
and it was pretty special
when I actually found out.

00:16:55.160 --> 00:16:57.420 align:middle line:84%
When you're a little
sleep-deprived,

00:16:57.420 --> 00:16:59.080 align:middle line:90%
this is what I uncovered.

00:16:59.080 --> 00:17:05.240 align:middle line:84%
I was having precognitive dreams
almost every single time I woke.

00:17:05.240 --> 00:17:09.349 align:middle line:84%
Obviously, I didn't know this
until the thing happened.

00:17:09.349 --> 00:17:14.210 align:middle line:84%
So if I'd have a break of
dreams, like a three-hour sleep,

00:17:14.210 --> 00:17:16.920 align:middle line:84%
wake up, and I had a
little sequence of dreams,

00:17:16.920 --> 00:17:19.190 align:middle line:90%
what ended up happening--

00:17:19.190 --> 00:17:21.060 align:middle line:84%
I still can hardly
believe this--

00:17:21.060 --> 00:17:24.680 align:middle line:84%
each one ended up
being precognitive.

00:17:24.680 --> 00:17:28.940 align:middle line:84%
And I would talk to
Richard again, I'm sorry.

00:17:28.940 --> 00:17:31.700 align:middle line:10%
Because you want
to claim what you

00:17:31.700 --> 00:17:35.070 align:middle line:10%
see so that you
prove to yourself.

00:17:35.070 --> 00:17:37.698 align:middle line:10%
And usually it's
great if you can get

00:17:37.698 --> 00:17:38.990 align:middle line:10%
the validation of someone else.

00:17:38.990 --> 00:17:41.660 align:middle line:84%
Voice-record as well, because
there's your timestamping.

00:17:41.660 --> 00:17:42.540 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:17:42.540 --> 00:17:43.370 align:middle line:90%
You need that.

00:17:43.370 --> 00:17:44.995 align:middle line:10%
Because if you have
it in your journal,

00:17:44.995 --> 00:17:47.900 align:middle line:10%
you know, but it's really
great if you can validate it

00:17:47.900 --> 00:17:49.680 align:middle line:10%
on another level to yourself.

00:17:49.680 --> 00:17:54.410 align:middle line:84%
So I can't even explain
how this happened,

00:17:54.410 --> 00:18:01.100 align:middle line:84%
but it happened so much
that I began to wonder,

00:18:01.100 --> 00:18:04.470 align:middle line:84%
is this the true
nature of our minds?

00:18:04.470 --> 00:18:07.490 align:middle line:90%
Why would this happen?

00:18:07.490 --> 00:18:12.590 align:middle line:10%
So if you ever try this, I want
to know if other people get

00:18:12.590 --> 00:18:13.940 align:middle line:10%
these same results.

00:18:13.940 --> 00:18:17.060 align:middle line:10%
If you end up seeing
precognition starts coming up

00:18:17.060 --> 00:18:20.870 align:middle line:10%
like this, I would love to know.

00:18:20.870 --> 00:18:22.340 align:middle line:10%
Record yourself.

00:18:22.340 --> 00:18:25.430 align:middle line:10%
Imprint it with
a voice recording

00:18:25.430 --> 00:18:26.910 align:middle line:10%
so you know the date and time.

00:18:26.910 --> 00:18:28.220 align:middle line:10%
Tell someone else.

00:18:28.220 --> 00:18:32.060 align:middle line:10%
And let's look at this.

00:18:32.060 --> 00:18:34.190 align:middle line:10%
So anyone who feels like
depriving themselves

00:18:34.190 --> 00:18:36.800 align:middle line:10%
of sleep for a little while
and trying something like this,

00:18:36.800 --> 00:18:38.090 align:middle line:10%
please let me know.

00:18:38.090 --> 00:18:41.390 align:middle line:84%
Here's another amazing mystery
of the mind that I cannot leave

00:18:41.390 --> 00:18:42.270 align:middle line:90%
alone.

00:18:42.270 --> 00:18:45.260 align:middle line:90%
So gamma brainwaves.

00:18:45.260 --> 00:18:48.140 align:middle line:90%
I am so fascinated with them.

00:18:48.140 --> 00:18:52.100 align:middle line:84%
Even though I don't really
strive for lucid dreams,

00:18:52.100 --> 00:18:56.180 align:middle line:84%
I am very interested in them
because of gamma brainwaves

00:18:56.180 --> 00:18:57.510 align:middle line:90%
coming into this.

00:18:57.510 --> 00:19:01.090 align:middle line:90%
So let me show you this.

00:19:01.090 --> 00:19:03.730 align:middle line:84%
So a lot of people know this,
but a lot of people don't.

00:19:03.730 --> 00:19:06.130 align:middle line:84%
So we'll just go
talk about this.

00:19:06.130 --> 00:19:09.360 align:middle line:84%
We're talking about the
electrical system of the brain

00:19:09.360 --> 00:19:11.890 align:middle line:90%
here, the brain oscillations.

00:19:11.890 --> 00:19:14.160 align:middle line:84%
I just made this
little scale because I

00:19:14.160 --> 00:19:17.580 align:middle line:84%
like things in pictures,
because I remember them better.

00:19:17.580 --> 00:19:20.020 align:middle line:90%
But delta, there's your sleep.

00:19:20.020 --> 00:19:21.810 align:middle line:84%
If you look at the
waves underneath,

00:19:21.810 --> 00:19:23.310 align:middle line:90%
delta is kind of like the ocean.

00:19:23.310 --> 00:19:24.210 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:19:24.210 --> 00:19:26.080 align:middle line:90%
Everything's calming.

00:19:26.080 --> 00:19:27.720 align:middle line:84%
And what's happening
during delta

00:19:27.720 --> 00:19:31.545 align:middle line:84%
is your brain is shutting
down and going offline.

00:19:31.545 --> 00:19:32.370 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:19:32.370 --> 00:19:34.110 align:middle line:84%
Then we'll look up
at the top again.

00:19:34.110 --> 00:19:36.510 align:middle line:90%
So I'm in beta right now.

00:19:36.510 --> 00:19:41.000 align:middle line:84%
I am talking and
thinking and reading.

00:19:41.000 --> 00:19:45.240 align:middle line:84%
So I've got this highly active
brainwave state right now.

00:19:45.240 --> 00:19:48.290 align:middle line:90%
You guys are here.

00:19:48.290 --> 00:19:49.880 align:middle line:90%
You're in a passive state.

00:19:49.880 --> 00:19:51.170 align:middle line:90%
You're listening.

00:19:51.170 --> 00:19:52.380 align:middle line:90%
You're in alpha.

00:19:52.380 --> 00:19:54.600 align:middle line:84%
All of these have
a bit of a range.

00:19:54.600 --> 00:19:56.930 align:middle line:90%
So you're more relaxed.

00:19:56.930 --> 00:19:59.420 align:middle line:10%
In theta, you're
getting down to a place

00:19:59.420 --> 00:20:01.770 align:middle line:10%
where the brain is
more impressionable.

00:20:01.770 --> 00:20:05.060 align:middle line:10%
If you go to hypnosis, they're
going to walk you down here,

00:20:05.060 --> 00:20:07.740 align:middle line:10%
to a way more relaxed state.

00:20:07.740 --> 00:20:10.310 align:middle line:84%
It's also associated with
mystical experience, which

00:20:10.310 --> 00:20:12.030 align:middle line:90%
can happen in delta as well.

00:20:12.030 --> 00:20:15.420 align:middle line:84%
The brainwaves are always
going on at the same time.

00:20:15.420 --> 00:20:16.640 align:middle line:90%
It's like a symphony.

00:20:16.640 --> 00:20:19.970 align:middle line:84%
But we can say
what's dominating.

00:20:19.970 --> 00:20:23.740 align:middle line:84%
So this is the general
scale right here.

00:20:23.740 --> 00:20:26.140 align:middle line:10%
So where does gamma come in?

00:20:26.140 --> 00:20:29.420 align:middle line:10%
Well, science didn't really care
about gamma for a long time.

00:20:29.420 --> 00:20:32.060 align:middle line:10%
And all of a sudden now
it is the hot topic.

00:20:32.060 --> 00:20:33.980 align:middle line:10%
It's very interesting.

00:20:33.980 --> 00:20:35.170 align:middle line:10%
Why?

00:20:35.170 --> 00:20:40.630 align:middle line:10%
Because when you're asleep
and your brain is offline,

00:20:40.630 --> 00:20:45.280 align:middle line:10%
if you happen to have a
dream that becomes lucid, all

00:20:45.280 --> 00:20:52.450 align:middle line:10%
of a sudden your brain starts
going super fast, faster

00:20:52.450 --> 00:20:54.680 align:middle line:10%
than your awake state.

00:20:54.680 --> 00:20:58.730 align:middle line:84%
Faster than your awake
state, but you're asleep.

00:20:58.730 --> 00:21:01.590 align:middle line:90%
So this is kind of interesting.

00:21:01.590 --> 00:21:03.780 align:middle line:90%
What's going on here?

00:21:03.780 --> 00:21:08.220 align:middle line:84%
So in brain scans, we
know that in delta,

00:21:08.220 --> 00:21:12.090 align:middle line:84%
your executive functioning is
going offline, the part that's

00:21:12.090 --> 00:21:13.230 align:middle line:90%
identifying as you.

00:21:13.230 --> 00:21:16.770 align:middle line:84%
Your occipital cortex, back
of the brain, your vision,

00:21:16.770 --> 00:21:19.200 align:middle line:90%
is going offline in delta.

00:21:19.200 --> 00:21:24.330 align:middle line:10%
But when you're asleep and
gamma kicks in, they know now

00:21:24.330 --> 00:21:26.760 align:middle line:10%
from brain imaging,
your prefrontal cortex,

00:21:26.760 --> 00:21:29.870 align:middle line:10%
although you're
sleeping, is back online,

00:21:29.870 --> 00:21:32.060 align:middle line:10%
the part that knows you're you.

00:21:32.060 --> 00:21:36.830 align:middle line:10%
And your visual occipital
cortex, the back of the brain,

00:21:36.830 --> 00:21:38.100 align:middle line:10%
comes online.

00:21:38.100 --> 00:21:43.740 align:middle line:10%
Your sight comes back
online during your sleep.

00:21:43.740 --> 00:21:47.340 align:middle line:10%
So something interesting
is happening here,

00:21:47.340 --> 00:21:51.180 align:middle line:10%
and they still don't know
exactly what's going on.

00:21:51.180 --> 00:21:54.690 align:middle line:10%
So we gotta look at,
when is gamma happening?

00:21:54.690 --> 00:21:56.390 align:middle line:10%
Is it just in lucid dreaming?

00:21:56.390 --> 00:21:57.740 align:middle line:10%
Or when else?

00:21:57.740 --> 00:22:01.790 align:middle line:10%
All I was going to add here
is just some scientists

00:22:01.790 --> 00:22:04.910 align:middle line:10%
are starting to
lean to questioning

00:22:04.910 --> 00:22:09.530 align:middle line:10%
whether this might be a
doorway to a hybrid state

00:22:09.530 --> 00:22:12.010 align:middle line:10%
of consciousness.

00:22:12.010 --> 00:22:13.670 align:middle line:90%
It's kind of interesting.

00:22:13.670 --> 00:22:15.500 align:middle line:84%
It's only happening
in the small time.

00:22:15.500 --> 00:22:18.050 align:middle line:84%
And why are these parts of
the brain coming online?

00:22:18.050 --> 00:22:19.450 align:middle line:90%
We don't know.

00:22:19.450 --> 00:22:22.050 align:middle line:90%
So where else does it happen?

00:22:22.050 --> 00:22:25.540 align:middle line:84%
It happens during
lucid dreaming.

00:22:25.540 --> 00:22:28.730 align:middle line:84%
They did a big study on
the Dalai Lama's monks.

00:22:28.730 --> 00:22:31.290 align:middle line:84%
They have huge
gamma when they do

00:22:31.290 --> 00:22:33.130 align:middle line:90%
their compassionate meditation.

00:22:33.130 --> 00:22:34.770 align:middle line:90%
So high-level meditators.

00:22:34.770 --> 00:22:36.480 align:middle line:90%
Ayahuasca.

00:22:36.480 --> 00:22:40.810 align:middle line:84%
Higher voltage than
the Dalai Lama's monks.

00:22:40.810 --> 00:22:43.560 align:middle line:84%
It was not recognized
for a long time,

00:22:43.560 --> 00:22:46.050 align:middle line:90%
but they are recognizing it now.

00:22:46.050 --> 00:22:50.660 align:middle line:90%
Remote viewing, OBE, death.

00:22:50.660 --> 00:22:55.940 align:middle line:84%
A brand-new study came
out this year, 2023,

00:22:55.940 --> 00:22:58.730 align:middle line:84%
where they had four people
hooked up who were dying.

00:22:58.730 --> 00:22:59.910 align:middle line:90%
Because they were in comas.

00:22:59.910 --> 00:23:03.110 align:middle line:90%
It was just a situation.

00:23:03.110 --> 00:23:09.230 align:middle line:84%
Two of the four had massive
gamma bursts when they died,

00:23:09.230 --> 00:23:11.810 align:middle line:90%
at the moment of death.

00:23:11.810 --> 00:23:15.440 align:middle line:84%
This is interesting when we
look at all of these together.

00:23:15.440 --> 00:23:21.020 align:middle line:84%
Seizures, schizophrenia,
Alzheimer's.

00:23:21.020 --> 00:23:22.890 align:middle line:90%
These aren't the only things.

00:23:22.890 --> 00:23:26.240 align:middle line:10%
But here we have what
we would, in this world,

00:23:26.240 --> 00:23:30.740 align:middle line:10%
call pathology along with
these amazing things, right?

00:23:30.740 --> 00:23:35.970 align:middle line:10%
But we call it pathology because
it doesn't fit in this world,

00:23:35.970 --> 00:23:38.100 align:middle line:10%
but we don't know what it is.

00:23:38.100 --> 00:23:39.600 align:middle line:10%
We really don't know what it is.

00:23:39.600 --> 00:23:42.680 align:middle line:10%
But all of these things
have something in common.

00:23:42.680 --> 00:23:45.590 align:middle line:10%
All of these things
are kind of touching

00:23:45.590 --> 00:23:51.375 align:middle line:10%
into something we perceive as
a different reality, perhaps.

00:23:51.375 --> 00:23:52.250 align:middle line:10%
I'll be conservative.

00:23:52.250 --> 00:23:55.080 align:middle line:10%
The possibility of
a different reality.

00:23:55.080 --> 00:23:58.820 align:middle line:84%
So are we accessing
something unusual?

00:23:58.820 --> 00:24:04.370 align:middle line:84%
Well, I listen to a lot of
scientists speak about this.

00:24:04.370 --> 00:24:09.290 align:middle line:84%
And when they were talking
about the difference, one

00:24:09.290 --> 00:24:10.340 align:middle line:90%
thing they noticed--

00:24:10.340 --> 00:24:14.040 align:middle line:84%
in particular, this person I've
been following, Jay Gunkelman,

00:24:14.040 --> 00:24:18.570 align:middle line:84%
who is considered an
expert in EEG and QEEG,

00:24:18.570 --> 00:24:21.650 align:middle line:84%
and he's studied over 500,000
brain scans or something like

00:24:21.650 --> 00:24:22.450 align:middle line:90%
that.

00:24:22.450 --> 00:24:25.320 align:middle line:10%
But one thing they
notice is a healthy brain

00:24:25.320 --> 00:24:28.450 align:middle line:10%
will have bursts of gamma
when these things happen.

00:24:28.450 --> 00:24:31.360 align:middle line:10%
An unhealthy brain-- only that
we deem "unhealthy," right?

00:24:31.360 --> 00:24:33.930 align:middle line:10%
Let's put that in quotes.

00:24:33.930 --> 00:24:36.760 align:middle line:10%
Isn't able to
navigate it as well.

00:24:36.760 --> 00:24:40.240 align:middle line:84%
And gamma locks in
and stays there.

00:24:40.240 --> 00:24:42.850 align:middle line:10%
And so I bring this
up for many reasons.

00:24:42.850 --> 00:24:44.710 align:middle line:10%
A, it's this incredible mystery.

00:24:44.710 --> 00:24:49.670 align:middle line:10%
B, sometimes when we're
doing these experiments,

00:24:49.670 --> 00:24:52.950 align:middle line:10%
there's a continuum here
of these amazing things.

00:24:52.950 --> 00:24:56.780 align:middle line:10%
But we also have to be
careful because of psychosis.

00:24:56.780 --> 00:24:58.580 align:middle line:90%
There's a scale here.

00:24:58.580 --> 00:25:01.160 align:middle line:84%
If we are experimenting,
we have to be sure

00:25:01.160 --> 00:25:02.960 align:middle line:84%
that we're giving
ourselves sleep,

00:25:02.960 --> 00:25:05.840 align:middle line:84%
and we're listening to the inner
version of ourselves that's

00:25:05.840 --> 00:25:07.980 align:middle line:84%
saying, I want to
stop for a while.

00:25:07.980 --> 00:25:08.870 align:middle line:90%
I want to go.

00:25:08.870 --> 00:25:10.440 align:middle line:90%
You've got to listen to this.

00:25:10.440 --> 00:25:12.770 align:middle line:10%
I really, truly believe--
this is my psych background

00:25:12.770 --> 00:25:14.690 align:middle line:10%
speaking--

00:25:14.690 --> 00:25:17.240 align:middle line:10%
the psyche is the
gatekeeper, and we can't just

00:25:17.240 --> 00:25:20.250 align:middle line:10%
bulldoze over that.

00:25:20.250 --> 00:25:25.490 align:middle line:10%
I truly believe if you get that
message to slow down, slow it

00:25:25.490 --> 00:25:30.620 align:middle line:10%
down, because you
will be rewarded

00:25:30.620 --> 00:25:33.770 align:middle line:10%
in the long run
for the slowdown.

00:25:33.770 --> 00:25:37.940 align:middle line:10%
If you rush over that
because you're too excited,

00:25:37.940 --> 00:25:42.290 align:middle line:10%
this is when things can happen
where you're heading down

00:25:42.290 --> 00:25:46.220 align:middle line:10%
the road of unhealthy psychosis
from not enough sleep, this kind

00:25:46.220 --> 00:25:47.020 align:middle line:10%
of thing.

00:25:47.020 --> 00:25:52.510 align:middle line:84%
So I want everyone to do healthy
experimenting and think of that.

00:25:52.510 --> 00:25:54.490 align:middle line:90%
The ego is the gatekeeper.

00:25:54.490 --> 00:25:56.770 align:middle line:84%
The psyche is the
gatekeeper to keep you safe.

00:25:56.770 --> 00:25:57.970 align:middle line:90%
And we do need that.

00:25:57.970 --> 00:25:58.935 align:middle line:90%
It's important as well.

00:25:58.935 --> 00:25:59.760 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:25:59.760 --> 00:26:01.690 align:middle line:90%
Is it a genuine reality?

00:26:01.690 --> 00:26:02.790 align:middle line:90%
We can't say for sure.

00:26:02.790 --> 00:26:05.140 align:middle line:90%
Is gamma a doorway?

00:26:05.140 --> 00:26:06.370 align:middle line:90%
Is that what they're seeing?

00:26:06.370 --> 00:26:07.272 align:middle line:90%
It's possible.

00:26:07.272 --> 00:26:08.230 align:middle line:90%
We don't know for sure.

00:26:08.230 --> 00:26:09.240 align:middle line:90%
Possibly.

00:26:09.240 --> 00:26:11.340 align:middle line:84%
Remote viewing
may actually offer

00:26:11.340 --> 00:26:15.870 align:middle line:84%
some of the best evidence of
this in controlled studies.

00:26:15.870 --> 00:26:18.330 align:middle line:10%
Abduction research.

00:26:18.330 --> 00:26:22.590 align:middle line:10%
Could gamma be a way that
they're accessing us?

00:26:22.590 --> 00:26:25.918 align:middle line:10%
If this is a doorway, is
this how they're getting in?

00:26:25.918 --> 00:26:28.210 align:middle line:10%
And I'm not saying this as
a bad thing or a good thing.

00:26:28.210 --> 00:26:29.890 align:middle line:10%
I'm not making a judgment on it.

00:26:29.890 --> 00:26:32.610 align:middle line:10%
It's just, as I said
in the beginning,

00:26:32.610 --> 00:26:36.000 align:middle line:10%
they are using our minds in a
more advanced way than we are,

00:26:36.000 --> 00:26:37.500 align:middle line:10%
and we have got to
keep that in mind

00:26:37.500 --> 00:26:40.060 align:middle line:10%
and keep striving to learn
more about ourselves.

00:26:40.060 --> 00:26:40.942 align:middle line:90%
And what about this?

00:26:40.942 --> 00:26:42.150 align:middle line:90%
I often think of it this way.

00:26:42.150 --> 00:26:43.390 align:middle line:90%
Beta isolation.

00:26:43.390 --> 00:26:45.720 align:middle line:84%
It seems like beta--
what I'm talking in,

00:26:45.720 --> 00:26:50.110 align:middle line:84%
there are everyday-- are we in
some kind of beta isolation?

00:26:50.110 --> 00:26:54.810 align:middle line:84%
Because to access anything
hypnosis, remote viewing, tarot,

00:26:54.810 --> 00:26:59.430 align:middle line:84%
mediumship, psychometry, any
of the psy stuff, meditation,

00:26:59.430 --> 00:27:01.380 align:middle line:84%
you've got to relax
down out of beta,

00:27:01.380 --> 00:27:04.180 align:middle line:84%
and that's where it
all becomes available.

00:27:04.180 --> 00:27:06.330 align:middle line:90%
So what's that?

00:27:06.330 --> 00:27:08.440 align:middle line:84%
What's the evolutionary
purpose of that.

00:27:08.440 --> 00:27:11.230 align:middle line:90%
I just wonder about this.

00:27:11.230 --> 00:27:14.080 align:middle line:84%
Why are we kind of
locked into this beta?

00:27:14.080 --> 00:27:17.620 align:middle line:10%
And it feels like a game that
you can't get out of sometimes.

00:27:17.620 --> 00:27:20.373 align:middle line:10%
You can, but we have
it set up and rigged

00:27:20.373 --> 00:27:22.540 align:middle line:10%
with all our social media
and all these crazy things

00:27:22.540 --> 00:27:24.100 align:middle line:10%
that we keep in beta.

00:27:24.100 --> 00:27:26.030 align:middle line:10%
But we want to go out.

00:27:26.030 --> 00:27:28.960 align:middle line:10%
It's just kind of a
fascinating look at ourselves.

00:27:28.960 --> 00:27:33.110 align:middle line:10%
OK, these are just a couple of
things I want you to know about.

00:27:33.110 --> 00:27:37.290 align:middle line:84%
Savvy human beings
were into these topics.

00:27:37.290 --> 00:27:39.040 align:middle line:84%
Obviously, that's
why we're all here.

00:27:39.040 --> 00:27:42.200 align:middle line:90%
So this is from MIT.

00:27:42.200 --> 00:27:43.830 align:middle line:90%
Dream incubation.

00:27:43.830 --> 00:27:46.520 align:middle line:84%
It's kind of what I was talking
about, where you have an idea,

00:27:46.520 --> 00:27:50.710 align:middle line:84%
and you're using that as the
target to open up your dreams.

00:27:50.710 --> 00:27:53.660 align:middle line:10%
Well, corporations have got
a hold of this research.

00:27:53.660 --> 00:27:56.420 align:middle line:10%
And I just want
everybody to know this.

00:27:56.420 --> 00:27:58.770 align:middle line:90%
They're into dream incubation.

00:27:58.770 --> 00:28:01.620 align:middle line:84%
So, for example, Coors was
just doing this huge thing.

00:28:01.620 --> 00:28:03.650 align:middle line:10%
And what they do
is they want you

00:28:03.650 --> 00:28:07.550 align:middle line:10%
to watch a stimulus movie
where they are pairing

00:28:07.550 --> 00:28:13.670 align:middle line:10%
beautiful mountains and
waterfalls and whatever

00:28:13.670 --> 00:28:16.830 align:middle line:10%
with Coors Light,
or Coors whatever.

00:28:16.830 --> 00:28:20.030 align:middle line:10%
And they want you to dream
about it because they know

00:28:20.030 --> 00:28:22.230 align:middle line:10%
that it influences behavior.

00:28:22.230 --> 00:28:25.400 align:middle line:84%
That is when you are very
vulnerable, I want to say.

00:28:25.400 --> 00:28:28.250 align:middle line:10%
Because your brain is going
offline when you sleep.

00:28:28.250 --> 00:28:32.550 align:middle line:10%
And we have Siri and Alexa and
this and that on our phones,

00:28:32.550 --> 00:28:33.920 align:middle line:10%
on our speakers, everywhere.

00:28:33.920 --> 00:28:36.060 align:middle line:90%
It's hard to even dismantle it.

00:28:36.060 --> 00:28:38.690 align:middle line:90%
Even in your Kindle reader.

00:28:38.690 --> 00:28:40.460 align:middle line:90%
They're all there, listening.

00:28:40.460 --> 00:28:42.750 align:middle line:90%
And it would take nothing.

00:28:42.750 --> 00:28:44.690 align:middle line:10%
When you're sleeping and
your brain's offline,

00:28:44.690 --> 00:28:47.730 align:middle line:10%
you are in the most
impressionable state.

00:28:47.730 --> 00:28:50.570 align:middle line:10%
We know this because
of studies they've

00:28:50.570 --> 00:28:53.220 align:middle line:10%
done where they've stopped
people smoking for a week.

00:28:53.220 --> 00:28:54.620 align:middle line:10%
They pair a smell--

00:28:54.620 --> 00:28:58.430 align:middle line:10%
cigarettes with rotten eggs--
and you won't smoke for a week.

00:28:58.430 --> 00:29:01.170 align:middle line:84%
They know they can influence
you in your dreams.

00:29:01.170 --> 00:29:02.020 align:middle line:90%
They know.

00:29:02.020 --> 00:29:05.910 align:middle line:10%
So corporations are into this,
and it's only just starting.

00:29:05.910 --> 00:29:08.850 align:middle line:10%
So we need to know about this.

00:29:08.850 --> 00:29:10.540 align:middle line:10%
OK?

00:29:10.540 --> 00:29:12.290 align:middle line:10%
This, it is huge.

00:29:12.290 --> 00:29:14.740 align:middle line:10%
And so this is important, too.

00:29:14.740 --> 00:29:17.480 align:middle line:10%
I don't know if everyone
keeps up with all this news.

00:29:17.480 --> 00:29:21.190 align:middle line:90%
I can hardly keep up with it.

00:29:21.190 --> 00:29:23.710 align:middle line:84%
Meta has an AI that
can read your mind

00:29:23.710 --> 00:29:24.710 align:middle line:90%
and draw your thoughts.

00:29:24.710 --> 00:29:29.200 align:middle line:84%
So we have text to
image right now.

00:29:29.200 --> 00:29:33.430 align:middle line:10%
You can put in some
words and make some art.

00:29:33.430 --> 00:29:38.958 align:middle line:10%
Most of the art here that
I made was done this way.

00:29:38.958 --> 00:29:43.120 align:middle line:10%
But Meta announced-- and this
was just the end of October they

00:29:43.120 --> 00:29:44.260 align:middle line:10%
announced this--

00:29:44.260 --> 00:29:48.240 align:middle line:10%
that they can do
thought to image.

00:29:48.240 --> 00:29:50.283 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to show
you with this--

00:29:50.283 --> 00:29:52.450 align:middle line:84%
we don't need audio on this
because it's probably me

00:29:52.450 --> 00:29:53.450 align:middle line:90%
breathing.

00:29:53.450 --> 00:29:55.970 align:middle line:90%
But watch this.

00:29:55.970 --> 00:29:58.630 align:middle line:84%
This is watching
someone's brainwaves.

00:29:58.630 --> 00:30:01.690 align:middle line:90%
Wait till we get down there.

00:30:01.690 --> 00:30:03.220 align:middle line:84%
I'm not going to
talk about that.

00:30:03.220 --> 00:30:04.450 align:middle line:90%
Look at this.

00:30:04.450 --> 00:30:09.730 align:middle line:84%
Someone's brainwaves, and that's
it, decoding our brainwaves.

00:30:09.730 --> 00:30:13.210 align:middle line:84%
It's not quite real time, but
you can see it's pretty good.

00:30:13.210 --> 00:30:15.560 align:middle line:90%
And that was a few weeks ago.

00:30:15.560 --> 00:30:18.760 align:middle line:84%
I can only imagine what
a few weeks will do.

00:30:18.760 --> 00:30:20.115 align:middle line:90%
I need you to know this.

00:30:20.115 --> 00:30:25.460 align:middle line:90%


00:30:25.460 --> 00:30:28.940 align:middle line:84%
And it's decoding what's
happening inside our brain, what

00:30:28.940 --> 00:30:30.350 align:middle line:90%
we're looking at.

00:30:30.350 --> 00:30:32.970 align:middle line:90%
It's decoding our brainwaves.

00:30:32.970 --> 00:30:33.770 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:30:33.770 --> 00:30:36.210 align:middle line:90%
Now, this is real time.

00:30:36.210 --> 00:30:38.010 align:middle line:90%
So it's not quite at real time.

00:30:38.010 --> 00:30:39.740 align:middle line:84%
You see it's a
little bit slower.

00:30:39.740 --> 00:30:44.390 align:middle line:84%
But this is what it's
getting, almost real time.

00:30:44.390 --> 00:30:45.840 align:middle line:90%
Look how close it is.

00:30:45.840 --> 00:30:46.880 align:middle line:90%
And that's now.

00:30:46.880 --> 00:30:48.450 align:middle line:90%
This will be different already.

00:30:48.450 --> 00:30:49.500 align:middle line:90%
It's two weeks later.

00:30:49.500 --> 00:30:52.730 align:middle line:84%
So this is from
the Meta website.

00:30:52.730 --> 00:30:54.380 align:middle line:84%
We need to know
about these things.

00:30:54.380 --> 00:30:58.760 align:middle line:10%
And dreams.

00:30:58.760 --> 00:31:01.280 align:middle line:10%
In the dream world, same thing.

00:31:01.280 --> 00:31:04.160 align:middle line:10%
All of this technology
is getting so scary

00:31:04.160 --> 00:31:06.350 align:middle line:10%
close and that we
really have to worry

00:31:06.350 --> 00:31:08.872 align:middle line:10%
about our brains
and our privacy.

00:31:08.872 --> 00:31:11.330 align:middle line:10%
We're all thinking we don't
have to worry about it until we

00:31:11.330 --> 00:31:12.372 align:middle line:10%
decide to have Neuralink.

00:31:12.372 --> 00:31:13.213 align:middle line:10%
Right?

00:31:13.213 --> 00:31:14.880 align:middle line:10%
We put something
physical in our brains.

00:31:14.880 --> 00:31:15.170 align:middle line:10%
No.

00:31:15.170 --> 00:31:17.780 align:middle line:10%
We actually have something
to worry about before that.

00:31:17.780 --> 00:31:19.610 align:middle line:84%
Because this is
how close we are.

00:31:19.610 --> 00:31:25.040 align:middle line:84%
And we are not close to quantum
computers being widespread,

00:31:25.040 --> 00:31:28.080 align:middle line:84%
to the full power of
this, what's coming.

00:31:28.080 --> 00:31:32.690 align:middle line:10%
So all we can do is
know that it's going on

00:31:32.690 --> 00:31:37.490 align:middle line:10%
and integrate this into our
thinking moving forward.

00:31:37.490 --> 00:31:39.320 align:middle line:90%
And keep an eye on it.

00:31:39.320 --> 00:31:41.390 align:middle line:90%
They've already markered out--

00:31:41.390 --> 00:31:43.050 align:middle line:90%
they did this in 2013.

00:31:43.050 --> 00:31:44.830 align:middle line:84%
And so just imagine
where they are now.

00:31:44.830 --> 00:31:46.750 align:middle line:84%
They can already tell
what we're dreaming.

00:31:46.750 --> 00:31:48.250 align:middle line:84%
They already have
that technology.

00:31:48.250 --> 00:31:49.420 align:middle line:90%
They've already mapped it.

00:31:49.420 --> 00:31:51.460 align:middle line:10%
It's just I haven't
seen anything.

00:31:51.460 --> 00:31:52.600 align:middle line:90%
It's gone dark.

00:31:52.600 --> 00:31:54.370 align:middle line:90%
So who knows?

00:31:54.370 --> 00:31:56.370 align:middle line:84%
As soon as I know,
though, and I find out,

00:31:56.370 --> 00:31:58.470 align:middle line:84%
it will be in my
next presentation.

00:31:58.470 --> 00:32:02.580 align:middle line:10%
So the keys that we need to
remember to open ourselves up

00:32:02.580 --> 00:32:09.210 align:middle line:10%
to this amazing supercomputer
that is lying in wait for us

00:32:09.210 --> 00:32:13.350 align:middle line:10%
to access it and program
it, kick it around,

00:32:13.350 --> 00:32:15.040 align:middle line:10%
see how far it can go.

00:32:15.040 --> 00:32:19.170 align:middle line:10%
We have the keys, but
it is that targeting

00:32:19.170 --> 00:32:22.350 align:middle line:10%
those ideas, why
you want to do it,

00:32:22.350 --> 00:32:26.070 align:middle line:10%
that conviction,
that's what you need.

00:32:26.070 --> 00:32:28.100 align:middle line:84%
And, yes, recording
your dreams every day.

00:32:28.100 --> 00:32:33.920 align:middle line:84%
But the art of the question,
that's all you need.

00:32:33.920 --> 00:32:37.400 align:middle line:84%
And then journaling it and
receiving it, making time

00:32:37.400 --> 00:32:40.150 align:middle line:90%
to receive it in the morning.

00:32:40.150 --> 00:32:43.000 align:middle line:84%
So I had to do this, a
note from your psyche.

00:32:43.000 --> 00:32:44.390 align:middle line:90%
The ego is your gatekeeper.

00:32:44.390 --> 00:32:45.290 align:middle line:90%
We talked about that.

00:32:45.290 --> 00:32:47.660 align:middle line:84%
The keymaster to
your deeper realms.

00:32:47.660 --> 00:32:49.960 align:middle line:90%
We have to respect it.

00:32:49.960 --> 00:32:52.133 align:middle line:90%
Honest self-assessments.

00:32:52.133 --> 00:32:53.800 align:middle line:84%
I always have people
who come up to me--

00:32:53.800 --> 00:32:55.870 align:middle line:84%
not always, but
sometimes-- who are

00:32:55.870 --> 00:32:57.410 align:middle line:90%
having some dark things happen.

00:32:57.410 --> 00:33:00.010 align:middle line:84%
If you are having
anything like that,

00:33:00.010 --> 00:33:06.820 align:middle line:84%
you have to be very honest with
yourself and do that check-in.

00:33:06.820 --> 00:33:08.410 align:middle line:90%
Are you getting proper sleep?

00:33:08.410 --> 00:33:11.300 align:middle line:84%
And what is the input
that you're putting in?

00:33:11.300 --> 00:33:12.660 align:middle line:90%
Do you watch horror movies?

00:33:12.660 --> 00:33:13.460 align:middle line:90%
Do you watch this?

00:33:13.460 --> 00:33:15.040 align:middle line:90%
Are you watching the news?

00:33:15.040 --> 00:33:17.540 align:middle line:84%
This is what a psychologist
will do with you.

00:33:17.540 --> 00:33:21.250 align:middle line:10%
You are going to take
it all out, all of it.

00:33:21.250 --> 00:33:23.110 align:middle line:10%
All of that input,
anything negative,

00:33:23.110 --> 00:33:25.510 align:middle line:10%
take it all out for a while
if you are experiencing

00:33:25.510 --> 00:33:28.240 align:middle line:10%
something that is scaring you.

00:33:28.240 --> 00:33:30.340 align:middle line:10%
And if you do all of that--

00:33:30.340 --> 00:33:32.380 align:middle line:10%
we have to be responsible
for ourselves.

00:33:32.380 --> 00:33:34.630 align:middle line:10%
If you do all of that and
you're still having trouble,

00:33:34.630 --> 00:33:38.330 align:middle line:10%
it is probably time to start
talking to some people.

00:33:38.330 --> 00:33:42.500 align:middle line:84%
So we have to be honest with
ourselves about these things.

00:33:42.500 --> 00:33:43.300 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:33:43.300 --> 00:33:45.440 align:middle line:84%
Record our experiences
immediately.

00:33:45.440 --> 00:33:46.670 align:middle line:90%
We talked about that.

00:33:46.670 --> 00:33:49.780 align:middle line:84%
Be judicious with what
you feed your brain.

00:33:49.780 --> 00:33:51.640 align:middle line:90%
Psychological sovereignty.

00:33:51.640 --> 00:33:54.250 align:middle line:84%
We kind of talked about
that as well already.

00:33:54.250 --> 00:33:56.590 align:middle line:90%
Why?

00:33:56.590 --> 00:33:59.400 align:middle line:90%
Why do this?

00:33:59.400 --> 00:34:03.035 align:middle line:10%
A lot of us who are here,
we feel this need to serve.

00:34:03.035 --> 00:34:05.710 align:middle line:10%


00:34:05.710 --> 00:34:10.340 align:middle line:10%
And-- it makes me emotional.

00:34:10.340 --> 00:34:17.230 align:middle line:10%
I think it's important for us to
feel fulfilled while we serve.

00:34:17.230 --> 00:34:18.302 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:34:18.302 --> 00:34:20.070 align:middle line:90%
[APPLAUSE]

00:34:20.070 --> 00:34:21.400 align:middle line:90%


00:34:21.400 --> 00:34:23.199 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:34:23.199 --> 00:34:25.070 align:middle line:84%
We have to light
our own light bulbs,

00:34:25.070 --> 00:34:28.380 align:middle line:84%
and then we can be
there for others.

00:34:28.380 --> 00:34:32.469 align:middle line:10%
This life is an amazing mystery,
all these incredible things

00:34:32.469 --> 00:34:34.980 align:middle line:10%
that we experience that
we know so little about.

00:34:34.980 --> 00:34:37.239 align:middle line:10%
Beautiful, beautiful things.

00:34:37.239 --> 00:34:41.100 align:middle line:10%
And I just want to
encourage all of us.

00:34:41.100 --> 00:34:43.280 align:middle line:90%
Know thyself, right?

00:34:43.280 --> 00:34:45.000 align:middle line:90%
We hear this all the time.

00:34:45.000 --> 00:34:48.150 align:middle line:84%
But I am just always
stuck on the beauty

00:34:48.150 --> 00:34:53.060 align:middle line:84%
of this, this place, where this
is the one remaining thing.

00:34:53.060 --> 00:34:54.400 align:middle line:90%
Know thyself.

00:34:54.400 --> 00:34:57.960 align:middle line:84%
And to me, I can't
say this is for sure,

00:34:57.960 --> 00:35:01.770 align:middle line:90%
it says, the key is inside you.

00:35:01.770 --> 00:35:08.580 align:middle line:10%
I truly believe we are
not accessing everything

00:35:08.580 --> 00:35:10.420 align:middle line:10%
that we are capable of.

00:35:10.420 --> 00:35:16.110 align:middle line:10%
The key to all of it, I
truly believe, is inside us,

00:35:16.110 --> 00:35:18.850 align:middle line:10%
and it's calling us towards it.

00:35:18.850 --> 00:35:20.490 align:middle line:84%
I believe we are
the greatest quantum

00:35:20.490 --> 00:35:24.250 align:middle line:90%
computers there will ever be.

00:35:24.250 --> 00:35:26.868 align:middle line:10%
We just haven't
discovered ourselves yet.

00:35:26.868 --> 00:35:28.040 align:middle line:90%
[CHEERS, APPLAUSE]

00:35:28.040 --> 00:35:28.840 align:middle line:90%
Yep.

00:35:28.840 --> 00:35:31.400 align:middle line:90%


00:35:31.400 --> 00:35:32.660 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:35:32.660 --> 00:35:34.480 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:35:34.480 --> 00:35:41.000 align:middle line:90%
