00:00:03.992 --> 00:00:07.485 align:middle line:90%
[AUDIO LOGO]

00:00:07.485 --> 00:00:11.477 align:middle line:90%


00:00:11.477 --> 00:00:14.980 align:middle line:90%
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:14.980 --> 00:00:16.560 align:middle line:84%
>> Thank you for
being here so much.

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:20.530 align:middle line:10%
This is really, really cool.

00:00:20.530 --> 00:00:25.930 align:middle line:10%
I'm truly honored to be here
with you and always so excited.

00:00:25.930 --> 00:00:27.710 align:middle line:90%
I have to acclimate the energy.

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:29.900 align:middle line:84%
You have to understand
how much energy is here.

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:33.520 align:middle line:84%
So this is why I got to do
this for a little bit just so--

00:00:33.520 --> 00:00:34.840 align:middle line:90%
yeah, I will talk.

00:00:34.840 --> 00:00:37.507 align:middle line:84%
I actually will talk, and I will
say something here in a minute,

00:00:37.507 --> 00:00:40.090 align:middle line:90%
but I am working with you.

00:00:40.090 --> 00:00:40.940 align:middle line:90%
Ooh, that's cool.

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:43.220 align:middle line:84%
They're saying I'm working
with you on many levels.

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:44.192 align:middle line:90%
[CHEERING]

00:00:44.192 --> 00:00:45.550 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHS]

00:00:45.550 --> 00:00:46.350 align:middle line:90%
I love it.

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:47.202 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:00:47.202 --> 00:00:50.750 align:middle line:84%
So don't be surprised
by what might happen.

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:53.630 align:middle line:90%
Be prepared.

00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:56.300 align:middle line:90%
If you are wanting--

00:00:56.300 --> 00:01:00.590 align:middle line:84%
Ooh, OK, I'm getting all
kinds of stuff coming in.

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:03.115 align:middle line:84%
Who's here actually
looking for healing?

00:01:03.115 --> 00:01:05.780 align:middle line:90%


00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:07.500 align:middle line:90%
Be open and allow it.

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:08.460 align:middle line:90%
OK, be ready.

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:09.410 align:middle line:90%
Allow it.

00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:11.030 align:middle line:90%
It's OK.

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:12.530 align:middle line:90%
Don't give off--

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:16.070 align:middle line:84%
Don't live off the habits
and old programming.

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:16.880 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:21.790 align:middle line:84%
Be ready to accept it and
receive it, and it is yours.

00:01:21.790 --> 00:01:22.590 align:middle line:90%
All right.

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:23.537 align:middle line:90%
So just be open.

00:01:23.537 --> 00:01:26.120 align:middle line:84%
Some things I might say today,
if you're not familiar with me,

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:28.700 align:middle line:84%
some things I might
say, might seem really,

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:30.980 align:middle line:90%
really out there and weird.

00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:39.230 align:middle line:84%
But if you know my mother,
[APPLAUSE], weird is OK, right?

00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:41.200 align:middle line:90%
We're in the weird group.

00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:42.870 align:middle line:90%
We're weirdies, and we love it.

00:01:42.870 --> 00:01:44.260 align:middle line:90%
It's all right.

00:01:44.260 --> 00:01:45.725 align:middle line:90%
This is who we are.

00:01:45.725 --> 00:01:48.450 align:middle line:90%


00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:52.260 align:middle line:84%
Not to age myself or any of you
that agree with me, but, I mean,

00:01:52.260 --> 00:01:55.410 align:middle line:84%
we went through this before in
the '60s and '70s people going,

00:01:55.410 --> 00:01:58.060 align:middle line:84%
this is who I am, and
I am speaking out.

00:01:58.060 --> 00:01:59.970 align:middle line:84%
And then we got in
this other part,

00:01:59.970 --> 00:02:03.192 align:middle line:84%
and now we're back here
going, this is who I am,

00:02:03.192 --> 00:02:04.650 align:middle line:84%
and this is who I
got to be, and we

00:02:04.650 --> 00:02:09.020 align:middle line:84%
got to be open and
allowing and ready.

00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:09.820 align:middle line:90%
Listen.

00:02:09.820 --> 00:02:11.160 align:middle line:90%
Be your authentic self.

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:12.700 align:middle line:90%
That's what that's all about.

00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:14.260 align:middle line:90%
Be you.

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:16.450 align:middle line:90%
And that keeps coming in.

00:02:16.450 --> 00:02:19.470 align:middle line:84%
So that must be a really,
really big message right now.

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:21.990 align:middle line:84%
This is your time
to understand what

00:02:21.990 --> 00:02:25.870 align:middle line:84%
is going on in the Earth
is to really look at it,

00:02:25.870 --> 00:02:27.100 align:middle line:90%
discern for yourself.

00:02:27.100 --> 00:02:30.150 align:middle line:84%
This is you taking your power
back, not believing everything

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:32.470 align:middle line:90%
you hear, what everybody else.

00:02:32.470 --> 00:02:33.970 align:middle line:90%
It may be right for them.

00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:35.110 align:middle line:90%
It may be their truth.

00:02:35.110 --> 00:02:36.180 align:middle line:90%
That's fine.

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:39.430 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't necessarily
have to be your truth.

00:02:39.430 --> 00:02:42.890 align:middle line:84%
I don't know who needs that,
but they want you to hear that.

00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:46.930 align:middle line:84%
So always have your
discernment hat on.

00:02:46.930 --> 00:02:50.270 align:middle line:10%
Always be going, how
does that feel to me?

00:02:50.270 --> 00:02:54.040 align:middle line:84%
And I will tell you in a
minute how you discern truth.

00:02:54.040 --> 00:02:56.770 align:middle line:84%
Because every single one
of you has that indicator,

00:02:56.770 --> 00:03:01.260 align:middle line:84%
how to detect truth when
it's said or when you say it.

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:02.060 align:middle line:90%
Isn't that cool?

00:03:02.060 --> 00:03:05.740 align:middle line:84%
Isn't that a wonderful ability
to know truth When you hear it?

00:03:05.740 --> 00:03:06.540 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:07.100 align:middle line:90%
So, OK.

00:03:07.100 --> 00:03:08.100 align:middle line:90%
So we'll go into that.

00:03:08.100 --> 00:03:08.900 align:middle line:90%
All right.

00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:12.290 align:middle line:90%
So just a very little bit.

00:03:12.290 --> 00:03:14.890 align:middle line:84%
I know the bio has that
I was a registered nurse,

00:03:14.890 --> 00:03:17.200 align:middle line:84%
and I was for many, many
years, over 20 years.

00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:19.420 align:middle line:84%
I worked in intensive
care, and then I

00:03:19.420 --> 00:03:20.780 align:middle line:90%
went into home health care.

00:03:20.780 --> 00:03:23.570 align:middle line:84%
And that was what I
always wanted to do.

00:03:23.570 --> 00:03:25.400 align:middle line:84%
All my life I wanted
to be a nurse.

00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:28.760 align:middle line:84%
I knew when I was 2 I'm
supposed to be a nurse.

00:03:28.760 --> 00:03:31.250 align:middle line:90%
That's where I'm going.

00:03:31.250 --> 00:03:33.380 align:middle line:90%
And I went right along track.

00:03:33.380 --> 00:03:34.240 align:middle line:90%
I did it.

00:03:34.240 --> 00:03:38.380 align:middle line:84%
Until after the 20-something
years and the universe is

00:03:38.380 --> 00:03:40.692 align:middle line:90%
saying, you need to stop that.

00:03:40.692 --> 00:03:41.900 align:middle line:90%
Now you need to go over here.

00:03:41.900 --> 00:03:42.700 align:middle line:90%
And I'm like, what?

00:03:42.700 --> 00:03:46.030 align:middle line:90%


00:03:46.030 --> 00:03:48.050 align:middle line:90%
I signed up to be a nurse.

00:03:48.050 --> 00:03:50.300 align:middle line:90%
I went to school to be a nurse.

00:03:50.300 --> 00:03:53.650 align:middle line:84%
I put lots and lots of
money in education and time

00:03:53.650 --> 00:03:54.860 align:middle line:90%
to be a nurse.

00:03:54.860 --> 00:03:58.240 align:middle line:84%
Anybody relate to me that
all of a sudden, yeah, yeah.

00:03:58.240 --> 00:04:00.110 align:middle line:90%
I did this.

00:04:00.110 --> 00:04:01.850 align:middle line:90%
This is my definition.

00:04:01.850 --> 00:04:03.950 align:middle line:90%
And now you want me to do this?

00:04:03.950 --> 00:04:07.360 align:middle line:84%
And I don't even
understand what this is.

00:04:07.360 --> 00:04:10.900 align:middle line:84%
And how the heck do I support
myself and make a living off

00:04:10.900 --> 00:04:11.750 align:middle line:90%
of this?

00:04:11.750 --> 00:04:12.980 align:middle line:90%
OK, I'll just get real.

00:04:12.980 --> 00:04:15.050 align:middle line:90%
How do I live in this world?

00:04:15.050 --> 00:04:18.550 align:middle line:84%
This one I'm very comfortable
in, and I can do quite well.

00:04:18.550 --> 00:04:21.290 align:middle line:90%
I may be sick and tired of it.

00:04:21.290 --> 00:04:25.100 align:middle line:84%
I may be burnt out, but this
is where I'm comfortable.

00:04:25.100 --> 00:04:27.190 align:middle line:90%
This is where I'm used to being.

00:04:27.190 --> 00:04:30.580 align:middle line:84%
You want me over here, and I
don't know what this looks like.

00:04:30.580 --> 00:04:32.600 align:middle line:90%
What is this?

00:04:32.600 --> 00:04:36.480 align:middle line:90%
Anybody relate to that?

00:04:36.480 --> 00:04:37.500 align:middle line:90%
Good.

00:04:37.500 --> 00:04:38.890 align:middle line:90%
You're in the right place.

00:04:38.890 --> 00:04:40.410 align:middle line:90%
I want you to know you're fine.

00:04:40.410 --> 00:04:44.800 align:middle line:84%
Listen, I will give
you my piece of advice

00:04:44.800 --> 00:04:47.100 align:middle line:84%
is if they're
telling you to move

00:04:47.100 --> 00:04:50.520 align:middle line:90%
and telling you to go, just go.

00:04:50.520 --> 00:04:52.720 align:middle line:84%
Don't wait for them
to make it happen.

00:04:52.720 --> 00:04:55.050 align:middle line:84%
Because if this is where
your journey is and you're

00:04:55.050 --> 00:04:58.210 align:middle line:84%
supposed to be over
here, it will happen.

00:04:58.210 --> 00:05:01.333 align:middle line:90%
It will be done.

00:05:01.333 --> 00:05:03.000 align:middle line:84%
Because this is
something you agreed to.

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:04.375 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to draw
it in a picture

00:05:04.375 --> 00:05:06.340 align:middle line:84%
how you agreed to this
before you ever came in.

00:05:06.340 --> 00:05:08.640 align:middle line:84%
So it's not like,
the gods have me.

00:05:08.640 --> 00:05:10.540 align:middle line:84%
I'm a victim, and
they're crucifying me.

00:05:10.540 --> 00:05:11.340 align:middle line:90%
Oh, my gosh!

00:05:11.340 --> 00:05:13.050 align:middle line:84%
That's how I felt
when it was happening

00:05:13.050 --> 00:05:15.330 align:middle line:90%
to me because I didn't listen.

00:05:15.330 --> 00:05:20.940 align:middle line:84%
And I'm just like,
how in the world

00:05:20.940 --> 00:05:24.390 align:middle line:84%
am I going to go do
that when I'm over here?

00:05:24.390 --> 00:05:28.470 align:middle line:84%
And it's like they said,
well, we'll show you how.

00:05:28.470 --> 00:05:35.040 align:middle line:84%
This one ceases to exist, then
you have to do something, right?

00:05:35.040 --> 00:05:36.750 align:middle line:90%
What?

00:05:36.750 --> 00:05:39.870 align:middle line:84%
On this side of it, I can laugh
at it now, and I can make jokes.

00:05:39.870 --> 00:05:44.970 align:middle line:84%
But, at that time, my gosh,
my world had just completely,

00:05:44.970 --> 00:05:48.310 align:middle line:90%
completely disintegrated.

00:05:48.310 --> 00:05:51.040 align:middle line:84%
And it's like, what
am I doing now?

00:05:51.040 --> 00:05:52.873 align:middle line:10%
So that's you're
scared, you're confused.

00:05:52.873 --> 00:05:54.040 align:middle line:90%
It's like, what is going on?

00:05:54.040 --> 00:05:56.800 align:middle line:84%
Looking back at it,
I had all the signs.

00:05:56.800 --> 00:05:57.940 align:middle line:90%
They were all there.

00:05:57.940 --> 00:05:59.560 align:middle line:90%
I had all the messages.

00:05:59.560 --> 00:06:01.870 align:middle line:90%
I just didn't heed them.

00:06:01.870 --> 00:06:03.780 align:middle line:84%
And that's why I
want to teach you

00:06:03.780 --> 00:06:08.700 align:middle line:84%
how they communicate so that
you will listen and maybe not go

00:06:08.700 --> 00:06:10.230 align:middle line:90%
through some of that.

00:06:10.230 --> 00:06:12.330 align:middle line:84%
Like I said last
night, if you can maybe

00:06:12.330 --> 00:06:16.320 align:middle line:90%
say how in a delicate way.

00:06:16.320 --> 00:06:18.810 align:middle line:90%
Can you show me how that looks--

00:06:18.810 --> 00:06:21.450 align:middle line:84%
maybe show me how it looks
rather than just how.

00:06:21.450 --> 00:06:23.910 align:middle line:84%
Because I was cocky,
you know, how?

00:06:23.910 --> 00:06:26.280 align:middle line:90%
And they're like, well--

00:06:26.280 --> 00:06:31.090 align:middle line:84%
so just saying, OK, so anybody
take from that what you want.

00:06:31.090 --> 00:06:35.980 align:middle line:84%
OK, so now I'm over in the
world of Dolores Cannon.

00:06:35.980 --> 00:06:36.980 align:middle line:90%
I mean, she's my mother.

00:06:36.980 --> 00:06:38.540 align:middle line:84%
I've been with
her all that time.

00:06:38.540 --> 00:06:43.270 align:middle line:84%
I was knowing about what was
going on, but now, I mean,

00:06:43.270 --> 00:06:44.915 align:middle line:90%
I'm in the deep end now.

00:06:44.915 --> 00:06:45.790 align:middle line:90%
I'm working with her.

00:06:45.790 --> 00:06:46.763 align:middle line:90%
I'm in all this.

00:06:46.763 --> 00:06:48.430 align:middle line:84%
And it still took
quite a while before I

00:06:48.430 --> 00:06:53.110 align:middle line:84%
understood what this was,
what actually was happening.

00:06:53.110 --> 00:06:55.120 align:middle line:10%
When I'm in classes
with her, I'm

00:06:55.120 --> 00:06:58.670 align:middle line:10%
in the back of the room working,
and she was teaching her class.

00:06:58.670 --> 00:07:00.730 align:middle line:84%
And there's a point
in the class where

00:07:00.730 --> 00:07:02.740 align:middle line:84%
we talk about this
part of ourselves that

00:07:02.740 --> 00:07:04.370 align:middle line:90%
has all the answers.

00:07:04.370 --> 00:07:06.370 align:middle line:84%
And every class I
was getting this--

00:07:06.370 --> 00:07:08.890 align:middle line:90%


00:07:08.890 --> 00:07:10.520 align:middle line:90%
and I'm like, what the heck?

00:07:10.520 --> 00:07:13.070 align:middle line:84%
And they're like, you, this
is what you need to be doing.

00:07:13.070 --> 00:07:16.630 align:middle line:84%
You need to write a book about
us, and how we talk to you,

00:07:16.630 --> 00:07:18.260 align:middle line:90%
and all these things.

00:07:18.260 --> 00:07:19.730 align:middle line:90%
I'm like, what?

00:07:19.730 --> 00:07:21.220 align:middle line:84%
And so I went to
mom, and I'm like,

00:07:21.220 --> 00:07:23.110 align:middle line:84%
they're telling me I
need to write this book,

00:07:23.110 --> 00:07:24.950 align:middle line:84%
but how about we
write it together?

00:07:24.950 --> 00:07:26.230 align:middle line:90%
She's like, no.

00:07:26.230 --> 00:07:27.770 align:middle line:90%
No, this one's your book.

00:07:27.770 --> 00:07:29.570 align:middle line:84%
I got enough books
I'm working on.

00:07:29.570 --> 00:07:30.770 align:middle line:90%
This one's yours.

00:07:30.770 --> 00:07:32.410 align:middle line:90%
I'm like, ah!

00:07:32.410 --> 00:07:37.180 align:middle line:84%
If you've read my book, you
see I resisted for seven years.

00:07:37.180 --> 00:07:38.295 align:middle line:90%
I'm good at that.

00:07:38.295 --> 00:07:39.820 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHS]

00:07:39.820 --> 00:07:40.810 align:middle line:90%
Really?

00:07:40.810 --> 00:07:41.610 align:middle line:90%
Really?

00:07:41.610 --> 00:07:44.170 align:middle line:90%
Do I really have to do it?

00:07:44.170 --> 00:07:47.030 align:middle line:84%
Oh, man, why are you
going to make me do this?

00:07:47.030 --> 00:07:48.500 align:middle line:90%
Because it was your plan.

00:07:48.500 --> 00:07:50.530 align:middle line:90%
It was just what you had set up.

00:07:50.530 --> 00:07:53.318 align:middle line:84%
And I don't know,
I feel like I'm

00:07:53.318 --> 00:07:55.360 align:middle line:84%
speaking to people that
know me, and you probably

00:07:55.360 --> 00:07:58.540 align:middle line:84%
heard all this before, and
I apologize if you have.

00:07:58.540 --> 00:08:01.630 align:middle line:90%
But 2012.

00:08:01.630 --> 00:08:04.450 align:middle line:90%
Interesting that year, isn't it?

00:08:04.450 --> 00:08:05.960 align:middle line:90%
It was 2012.

00:08:05.960 --> 00:08:10.920 align:middle line:84%
I get the message,
you have one year.

00:08:10.920 --> 00:08:13.850 align:middle line:84%
If you don't put this out,
we'll give it to someone else.

00:08:13.850 --> 00:08:17.070 align:middle line:90%


00:08:17.070 --> 00:08:18.160 align:middle line:90%
That got my attention.

00:08:18.160 --> 00:08:20.100 align:middle line:90%
I'm like, it's mine.

00:08:20.100 --> 00:08:21.460 align:middle line:90%
You said it was mine.

00:08:21.460 --> 00:08:22.540 align:middle line:90%
You told me to do it.

00:08:22.540 --> 00:08:25.200 align:middle line:84%
And they're like, but
you're not doing it.

00:08:25.200 --> 00:08:26.865 align:middle line:90%
This is what you wanted to do.

00:08:26.865 --> 00:08:28.240 align:middle line:84%
This is what you
came here to do.

00:08:28.240 --> 00:08:29.380 align:middle line:90%
You're not doing it.

00:08:29.380 --> 00:08:31.210 align:middle line:84%
We can give it to
someone else who will.

00:08:31.210 --> 00:08:34.150 align:middle line:90%
I'm like, no, no, no, no, no.

00:08:34.150 --> 00:08:37.270 align:middle line:84%
Well, see that apparently that's
how I need to be spoken to.

00:08:37.270 --> 00:08:38.690 align:middle line:90%
They know what motivates me.

00:08:38.690 --> 00:08:39.490 align:middle line:90%
Take it away.

00:08:39.490 --> 00:08:40.720 align:middle line:90%
Oh, no, it's mine.

00:08:40.720 --> 00:08:43.420 align:middle line:84%
And I want you to know
within a year it was done.

00:08:43.420 --> 00:08:44.220 align:middle line:90%
It was written.

00:08:44.220 --> 00:08:45.428 align:middle line:90%
It was published, everything.

00:08:45.428 --> 00:08:47.190 align:middle line:90%
So it was like it was done.

00:08:47.190 --> 00:08:49.980 align:middle line:90%
So yeah.

00:08:49.980 --> 00:08:52.900 align:middle line:90%
And then so that was that.

00:08:52.900 --> 00:08:58.650 align:middle line:84%
Now, where this is coming
from, so much of it is from--

00:08:58.650 --> 00:09:00.400 align:middle line:84%
my mother kept coming
back from sessions.

00:09:00.400 --> 00:09:03.190 align:middle line:84%
It's like, oh, my gosh,
guess what I learned today?

00:09:03.190 --> 00:09:04.840 align:middle line:90%
Guess what this means?

00:09:04.840 --> 00:09:07.000 align:middle line:84%
And they're telling
me these mean things.

00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:08.230 align:middle line:90%
I'm like, oh, my gosh.

00:09:08.230 --> 00:09:12.500 align:middle line:84%
Well, my background in
nursing, I love the body.

00:09:12.500 --> 00:09:15.530 align:middle line:84%
I think it's a
fascinating machine.

00:09:15.530 --> 00:09:19.240 align:middle line:84%
It's a biological-- and I love
how Jason said last night,

00:09:19.240 --> 00:09:20.760 align:middle line:90%
it's a conscious machine.

00:09:20.760 --> 00:09:21.560 align:middle line:90%
It is.

00:09:21.560 --> 00:09:22.760 align:middle line:90%
The cells have consciousness.

00:09:22.760 --> 00:09:23.968 align:middle line:90%
Everything has consciousness.

00:09:23.968 --> 00:09:26.290 align:middle line:84%
It's a biological
conscious machine

00:09:26.290 --> 00:09:29.110 align:middle line:90%
that we, our, spirits house in.

00:09:29.110 --> 00:09:32.530 align:middle line:84%
So that was the
understanding of, OK,

00:09:32.530 --> 00:09:34.160 align:middle line:84%
then how is all
this work together?

00:09:34.160 --> 00:09:39.280 align:middle line:84%
And it's showing how the body
is always delivering messages

00:09:39.280 --> 00:09:40.870 align:middle line:84%
because it wants
you to understand

00:09:40.870 --> 00:09:44.110 align:middle line:84%
you're a spiritual being
residing in this body.

00:09:44.110 --> 00:09:47.030 align:middle line:90%
How can we communicate with you?

00:09:47.030 --> 00:09:48.050 align:middle line:90%
How can we do things?

00:09:48.050 --> 00:09:49.930 align:middle line:84%
So what I'm going
to draw here now

00:09:49.930 --> 00:09:52.550 align:middle line:84%
is a better picture
of what they gave me.

00:09:52.550 --> 00:09:54.260 align:middle line:90%
They meaning my higher self.

00:09:54.260 --> 00:09:58.535 align:middle line:84%
And I'll explain why I and my
mother and probably many of us

00:09:58.535 --> 00:10:00.160 align:middle line:84%
that have communication
with this part,

00:10:00.160 --> 00:10:04.220 align:middle line:84%
we refer to them as
we, as they and we.

00:10:04.220 --> 00:10:05.020 align:middle line:90%
It's a plural.

00:10:05.020 --> 00:10:08.470 align:middle line:84%
Because they present
themselves as a collective,

00:10:08.470 --> 00:10:10.040 align:middle line:84%
and you will
understand exactly why.

00:10:10.040 --> 00:10:11.530 align:middle line:84%
So this is a picture
that they gave

00:10:11.530 --> 00:10:18.100 align:middle line:84%
me to draw to help understand
who they are and who you are,

00:10:18.100 --> 00:10:20.710 align:middle line:84%
who each and one
of us really are.

00:10:20.710 --> 00:10:22.770 align:middle line:90%
Each one of us really is--

00:10:22.770 --> 00:10:23.570 align:middle line:90%
grammar.

00:10:23.570 --> 00:10:24.720 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:10:24.720 --> 00:10:25.520 align:middle line:90%
Say it right.

00:10:25.520 --> 00:10:27.740 align:middle line:90%
OK, so what they showed me.

00:10:27.740 --> 00:10:33.333 align:middle line:84%
And always remember, we're
using limited abilities.

00:10:33.333 --> 00:10:35.500 align:middle line:84%
When we do anything on
screens and things like that,

00:10:35.500 --> 00:10:36.910 align:middle line:84%
it's limited in
what we're doing.

00:10:36.910 --> 00:10:39.800 align:middle line:84%
And what I'm talking about
is something that's infinite.

00:10:39.800 --> 00:10:42.040 align:middle line:10%
So I'm going to need you
to use your imagination,

00:10:42.040 --> 00:10:45.610 align:middle line:10%
but you'll get the idea that
everything in this drawing

00:10:45.610 --> 00:10:47.020 align:middle line:10%
is showing limitations.

00:10:47.020 --> 00:10:49.440 align:middle line:90%
And there are no limitations.

00:10:49.440 --> 00:10:50.240 align:middle line:90%
All right.

00:10:50.240 --> 00:10:51.740 align:middle line:84%
So the first thing
is that I'm going

00:10:51.740 --> 00:10:53.230 align:middle line:84%
to make this little
mark down here,

00:10:53.230 --> 00:10:56.000 align:middle line:84%
and I have to draw it fairly
big just so you can see it.

00:10:56.000 --> 00:10:59.030 align:middle line:84%
But just know that it's
completely out of perspective.

00:10:59.030 --> 00:11:01.180 align:middle line:84%
It's out of ratio from
everything that's on here.

00:11:01.180 --> 00:11:03.220 align:middle line:84%
But that is representing
you, each one

00:11:03.220 --> 00:11:05.200 align:middle line:90%
of you sitting in your chair.

00:11:05.200 --> 00:11:06.540 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:11:06.540 --> 00:11:07.820 align:middle line:90%
That's who you think you are.

00:11:07.820 --> 00:11:09.340 align:middle line:90%
You think you're this person.

00:11:09.340 --> 00:11:10.140 align:middle line:90%
All right.

00:11:10.140 --> 00:11:13.822 align:middle line:90%


00:11:13.822 --> 00:11:14.780 align:middle line:10%
OK, everybody see that?

00:11:14.780 --> 00:11:15.863 align:middle line:10%
That's who you really are.

00:11:15.863 --> 00:11:21.180 align:middle line:10%
You're this great,
big, powerful being.

00:11:21.180 --> 00:11:21.980 align:middle line:90%
You're big.

00:11:21.980 --> 00:11:23.320 align:middle line:90%
You're huge.

00:11:23.320 --> 00:11:26.680 align:middle line:84%
A piece of you just decided
to come down and have

00:11:26.680 --> 00:11:28.580 align:middle line:90%
this experience called you.

00:11:28.580 --> 00:11:29.380 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:11:29.380 --> 00:11:33.730 align:middle line:84%
I like to call this
big me and little me.

00:11:33.730 --> 00:11:35.560 align:middle line:84%
So we're just being
our little me's.

00:11:35.560 --> 00:11:38.850 align:middle line:84%
And sometimes we do that very
well, just being itty bitty me.

00:11:38.850 --> 00:11:40.120 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHS] OK.

00:11:40.120 --> 00:11:50.972 align:middle line:84%
Now, so the person next to
you, they're sitting there.

00:11:50.972 --> 00:11:53.850 align:middle line:10%
Then there's another
person, another person

00:11:53.850 --> 00:11:55.590 align:middle line:10%
on the other side.

00:11:55.590 --> 00:11:58.770 align:middle line:90%
What are you seeing?

00:11:58.770 --> 00:11:59.980 align:middle line:90%
They're overlapping.

00:11:59.980 --> 00:12:02.220 align:middle line:90%
What does that mean?

00:12:02.220 --> 00:12:03.300 align:middle line:90%
Connected.

00:12:03.300 --> 00:12:06.280 align:middle line:84%
Where have you heard that
before, we are all connected?

00:12:06.280 --> 00:12:08.230 align:middle line:84%
That's what makes
that a true statement.

00:12:08.230 --> 00:12:12.900 align:middle line:84%
Once you get out of the little
me state, we are all connected.

00:12:12.900 --> 00:12:14.100 align:middle line:90%
We know that.

00:12:14.100 --> 00:12:19.450 align:middle line:84%
It's this little me part
that perceives separateness.

00:12:19.450 --> 00:12:21.850 align:middle line:90%
OK, so just keep that in mind.

00:12:21.850 --> 00:12:24.000 align:middle line:10%
All right.

00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:29.070 align:middle line:10%
Up here, let me do
this as a yellow,

00:12:29.070 --> 00:12:32.550 align:middle line:10%
I see it as wavy because
I see it as breathing.

00:12:32.550 --> 00:12:33.660 align:middle line:10%
All right.

00:12:33.660 --> 00:12:36.930 align:middle line:10%
That is source.

00:12:36.930 --> 00:12:39.340 align:middle line:10%
God, Source, whatever
you want to call it.

00:12:39.340 --> 00:12:45.480 align:middle line:10%
And this big part
melds with source.

00:12:45.480 --> 00:12:48.750 align:middle line:84%
Any of you heard the
statement, we are God?

00:12:48.750 --> 00:12:54.320 align:middle line:84%
OK, big me is melding
up there with source.

00:12:54.320 --> 00:12:56.750 align:middle line:90%
And so that's God, right?

00:12:56.750 --> 00:12:58.700 align:middle line:84%
Can you believe that
part of you has all

00:12:58.700 --> 00:13:01.590 align:middle line:84%
this God ability and all
this unlimited things that

00:13:01.590 --> 00:13:02.390 align:middle line:90%
can do anything?

00:13:02.390 --> 00:13:04.500 align:middle line:84%
Because we think God
can do anything right?

00:13:04.500 --> 00:13:06.170 align:middle line:90%
No limits.

00:13:06.170 --> 00:13:07.940 align:middle line:84%
Are we on the same
page there, God

00:13:07.940 --> 00:13:10.270 align:middle line:84%
is the supreme being of
whatever we want to see it as.

00:13:10.270 --> 00:13:11.070 align:middle line:90%
Its energy.

00:13:11.070 --> 00:13:14.460 align:middle line:84%
It's whatever our belief
system is, it can do anything.

00:13:14.460 --> 00:13:16.410 align:middle line:84%
We pray to it to
do anything, right?

00:13:16.410 --> 00:13:19.160 align:middle line:90%
Please, please, please.

00:13:19.160 --> 00:13:22.610 align:middle line:90%
So we must assume it can.

00:13:22.610 --> 00:13:29.030 align:middle line:84%
Well, if that part of us melds
with God, then that part of us

00:13:29.030 --> 00:13:35.820 align:middle line:90%
can also do anything, correct?

00:13:35.820 --> 00:13:37.530 align:middle line:90%
Would that be a safe assumption?

00:13:37.530 --> 00:13:38.330 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:13:38.330 --> 00:13:39.440 align:middle line:90%
>> OK, thank you.

00:13:39.440 --> 00:13:40.260 align:middle line:90%
All right.

00:13:40.260 --> 00:13:43.730 align:middle line:84%
And remember, big me just
sent down part of itself

00:13:43.730 --> 00:13:45.770 align:middle line:90%
into what is known as you.

00:13:45.770 --> 00:13:49.170 align:middle line:90%
So what does that make you?

00:13:49.170 --> 00:13:50.420 align:middle line:90%
God.

00:13:50.420 --> 00:13:51.220 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:13:51.220 --> 00:13:54.780 align:middle line:84%
If big me melds with God, and
big me is you, it's part of you,

00:13:54.780 --> 00:13:56.080 align:middle line:90%
then you're God.

00:13:56.080 --> 00:13:58.890 align:middle line:84%
That's how that is
a true statement.

00:13:58.890 --> 00:14:00.670 align:middle line:90%
We are God.

00:14:00.670 --> 00:14:02.380 align:middle line:90%
No, I can't say that.

00:14:02.380 --> 00:14:03.190 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, you can.

00:14:03.190 --> 00:14:04.590 align:middle line:90%
I'm drawing you a picture.

00:14:04.590 --> 00:14:08.380 align:middle line:84%
OK, this is why you can
say that, it's real.

00:14:08.380 --> 00:14:11.430 align:middle line:84%
And that's what's so cool is
like this is, oh, my gosh, that

00:14:11.430 --> 00:14:13.530 align:middle line:84%
makes so much sense when
I was first shown this.

00:14:13.530 --> 00:14:15.790 align:middle line:90%
That explains everything.

00:14:15.790 --> 00:14:20.430 align:middle line:84%
Now, this goes into way more
details, but for this talk

00:14:20.430 --> 00:14:21.580 align:middle line:90%
here, I won't do that.

00:14:21.580 --> 00:14:23.560 align:middle line:90%
It goes into simultaneous time.

00:14:23.560 --> 00:14:25.810 align:middle line:84%
I mean, this picture
can draw so many things.

00:14:25.810 --> 00:14:26.732 align:middle line:90%
It's really cool.

00:14:26.732 --> 00:14:28.440 align:middle line:10%
The biggest thing that
I want you to know

00:14:28.440 --> 00:14:33.930 align:middle line:10%
is right here at this
point of supposed

00:14:33.930 --> 00:14:38.460 align:middle line:10%
where it makes that
delineation, that's the veil.

00:14:38.460 --> 00:14:40.500 align:middle line:10%
The veil is sitting in there.

00:14:40.500 --> 00:14:43.200 align:middle line:10%
OK, and that's where our guides
and guardian angels are sitting.

00:14:43.200 --> 00:14:44.760 align:middle line:10%
They're in the veil.

00:14:44.760 --> 00:14:49.812 align:middle line:84%
Now, what does the veil do
for us here on this plane?

00:14:49.812 --> 00:14:53.520 align:middle line:90%
>> [INDISTINCT] a blank slate.

00:14:53.520 --> 00:14:55.920 align:middle line:90%
>> A blank slate.

00:14:55.920 --> 00:14:57.380 align:middle line:90%
Makes us forget.

00:14:57.380 --> 00:15:01.280 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, we come through that veil,
that's part of experience planet

00:15:01.280 --> 00:15:02.080 align:middle line:90%
Earth.

00:15:02.080 --> 00:15:04.890 align:middle line:84%
You come through the
veil and you forget.

00:15:04.890 --> 00:15:07.440 align:middle line:90%
You forget who you are.

00:15:07.440 --> 00:15:09.580 align:middle line:84%
You forget what
you're doing here.

00:15:09.580 --> 00:15:11.370 align:middle line:10%
You forget everything
because then you

00:15:11.370 --> 00:15:15.090 align:middle line:10%
can have these wonderful
experiences to learn from

00:15:15.090 --> 00:15:18.210 align:middle line:10%
and build and grow from.

00:15:18.210 --> 00:15:19.900 align:middle line:84%
That's what the
whole thing is about.

00:15:19.900 --> 00:15:22.210 align:middle line:90%
We want to remember it's a game.

00:15:22.210 --> 00:15:25.350 align:middle line:84%
We were-- oh, my gosh, we're
great, powerful beings.

00:15:25.350 --> 00:15:28.350 align:middle line:84%
You think we can
do anything, why

00:15:28.350 --> 00:15:30.750 align:middle line:90%
do you think we would do this?

00:15:30.750 --> 00:15:32.730 align:middle line:90%
We get bored.

00:15:32.730 --> 00:15:33.910 align:middle line:90%
We get bored.

00:15:33.910 --> 00:15:34.840 align:middle line:90%
I want to challenge.

00:15:34.840 --> 00:15:35.770 align:middle line:90%
I want something else.

00:15:35.770 --> 00:15:37.620 align:middle line:90%
I want something to hone me.

00:15:37.620 --> 00:15:40.630 align:middle line:90%
What else can I do?

00:15:40.630 --> 00:15:44.310 align:middle line:84%
Only very brave
manifestors, I mean,

00:15:44.310 --> 00:15:47.600 align:middle line:84%
the top ones can get the
golden ticket to come to Earth.

00:15:47.600 --> 00:15:50.570 align:middle line:84%
You have to be a
master manifester.

00:15:50.570 --> 00:15:53.560 align:middle line:84%
Pat yourself on
the back, please.

00:15:53.560 --> 00:15:57.550 align:middle line:84%
I mean, really it's
not just anybody

00:15:57.550 --> 00:16:00.050 align:middle line:90%
is strong enough to come here.

00:16:00.050 --> 00:16:03.460 align:middle line:10%
They tell us over and over
again you were very brave.

00:16:03.460 --> 00:16:06.610 align:middle line:10%
It takes a very brave
soul to come to Earth.

00:16:06.610 --> 00:16:08.150 align:middle line:90%
Do you think they were right?

00:16:08.150 --> 00:16:09.560 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:16:09.560 --> 00:16:10.480 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:16:10.480 --> 00:16:11.370 align:middle line:90%
>> Heck, yeah.

00:16:11.370 --> 00:16:13.870 align:middle line:84%
My gosh, what we do here, and
what we put ourselves through,

00:16:13.870 --> 00:16:17.180 align:middle line:84%
and what we put each other
through, oh, my gosh.

00:16:17.180 --> 00:16:18.470 align:middle line:90%
But we're learning.

00:16:18.470 --> 00:16:21.130 align:middle line:84%
And what the biggest thing
we want to remember and learn

00:16:21.130 --> 00:16:23.890 align:middle line:90%
is that this, who we are.

00:16:23.890 --> 00:16:25.160 align:middle line:90%
And we created it.

00:16:25.160 --> 00:16:26.590 align:middle line:90%
We did this.

00:16:26.590 --> 00:16:29.440 align:middle line:84%
I mean, that's
like this, [SIGHS],

00:16:29.440 --> 00:16:34.630 align:middle line:84%
when I got that, I'm
like, are you kidding me?

00:16:34.630 --> 00:16:37.490 align:middle line:90%
It's all a game, guys.

00:16:37.490 --> 00:16:38.750 align:middle line:90%
And we're just learning.

00:16:38.750 --> 00:16:40.250 align:middle line:84%
We're going through
the experiences,

00:16:40.250 --> 00:16:42.130 align:middle line:84%
and we're learning and
learning and learning.

00:16:42.130 --> 00:16:43.750 align:middle line:84%
I mean, look at the
games that are out there

00:16:43.750 --> 00:16:44.870 align:middle line:90%
that these kids are playing on.

00:16:44.870 --> 00:16:46.953 align:middle line:84%
Maybe some of you are still
playing, I don't know.

00:16:46.953 --> 00:16:48.710 align:middle line:90%
That's not my generation.

00:16:48.710 --> 00:16:50.390 align:middle line:84%
My daughter is
still playing on it.

00:16:50.390 --> 00:16:51.320 align:middle line:90%
So they are.

00:16:51.320 --> 00:16:54.280 align:middle line:84%
So if you look at
them, what is it?

00:16:54.280 --> 00:16:55.250 align:middle line:90%
The one mirrors life?

00:16:55.250 --> 00:16:56.580 align:middle line:90%
How does that work, the nature?

00:16:56.580 --> 00:16:57.380 align:middle line:90%
How does that work?

00:16:57.380 --> 00:16:59.170 align:middle line:90%
What's that saying?

00:16:59.170 --> 00:17:01.090 align:middle line:84%
Art imitates life or
something like that.

00:17:01.090 --> 00:17:01.890 align:middle line:90%
So it's like that.

00:17:01.890 --> 00:17:03.650 align:middle line:90%
>> Art imitates nature.

00:17:03.650 --> 00:17:04.700 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:17:04.700 --> 00:17:07.069 align:middle line:84%
So it's where the thing
that's being assimilated,

00:17:07.069 --> 00:17:08.000 align:middle line:90%
it's like that.

00:17:08.000 --> 00:17:09.540 align:middle line:90%
They're imitating what's real.

00:17:09.540 --> 00:17:10.950 align:middle line:90%
See, where is that coming from?

00:17:10.950 --> 00:17:13.619 align:middle line:84%
Where are those games coming
from to work that way?

00:17:13.619 --> 00:17:14.640 align:middle line:90%
Hello.

00:17:14.640 --> 00:17:16.410 align:middle line:90%
It's what we're doing.

00:17:16.410 --> 00:17:19.623 align:middle line:84%
It's exactly what we're doing
in this game board Earth

00:17:19.623 --> 00:17:22.040 align:middle line:84%
where we move through the
layers, and we're going through,

00:17:22.040 --> 00:17:24.680 align:middle line:84%
and we're getting our abilities,
and we're understanding more.

00:17:24.680 --> 00:17:27.300 align:middle line:84%
And we're honing ourselves,
and we keep moving higher.

00:17:27.300 --> 00:17:29.330 align:middle line:84%
And we go to another
level, and we get more,

00:17:29.330 --> 00:17:30.470 align:middle line:90%
and we go to another level.

00:17:30.470 --> 00:17:34.140 align:middle line:84%
Until we finally at the end,
we realize it was a game.

00:17:34.140 --> 00:17:34.940 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:17:34.940 --> 00:17:37.110 align:middle line:90%
We created the game.

00:17:37.110 --> 00:17:40.080 align:middle line:90%
Oh, my gosh, that's who we are.

00:17:40.080 --> 00:17:41.100 align:middle line:90%
That's where we're at.

00:17:41.100 --> 00:17:45.020 align:middle line:84%
We're at that point of
realizing this is who we are.

00:17:45.020 --> 00:17:46.610 align:middle line:90%
Isn't that cool?

00:17:46.610 --> 00:17:48.170 align:middle line:84%
I had somebody say
one time, well,

00:17:48.170 --> 00:17:49.900 align:middle line:90%
what happens when you finish it?

00:17:49.900 --> 00:17:51.300 align:middle line:90%
I said, I guess, it's game over.

00:17:51.300 --> 00:17:52.100 align:middle line:90%
I don't know.

00:17:52.100 --> 00:17:53.180 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:17:53.180 --> 00:17:55.970 align:middle line:84%
And, I think, actually,
we're at that point.

00:17:55.970 --> 00:17:57.660 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't mean
it all goes away.

00:17:57.660 --> 00:17:59.310 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't mean,
oh, end of Earth.

00:17:59.310 --> 00:18:04.450 align:middle line:84%
It means, [SIGHS] now we
get to change the rules.

00:18:04.450 --> 00:18:06.442 align:middle line:84%
See, because there were
rules to that game.

00:18:06.442 --> 00:18:07.900 align:middle line:84%
It was that you're
going to forget.

00:18:07.900 --> 00:18:09.400 align:middle line:84%
You're going to do
all these things.

00:18:09.400 --> 00:18:11.220 align:middle line:84%
Now we get to go
through, and we now

00:18:11.220 --> 00:18:15.520 align:middle line:84%
get to consciously,
consciously do these things.

00:18:15.520 --> 00:18:20.460 align:middle line:84%
We have done it for so long in
amnesia state, unconsciously.

00:18:20.460 --> 00:18:21.880 align:middle line:84%
We didn't know
what we were doing.

00:18:21.880 --> 00:18:23.380 align:middle line:84%
We were just aimlessly
going around.

00:18:23.380 --> 00:18:26.010 align:middle line:84%
And we finally hit a point
where we go, oh, my gosh,

00:18:26.010 --> 00:18:27.120 align:middle line:90%
could there be more?

00:18:27.120 --> 00:18:28.780 align:middle line:90%
Oh, my gosh, what is this?

00:18:28.780 --> 00:18:30.190 align:middle line:90%
Is this really something?

00:18:30.190 --> 00:18:32.290 align:middle line:10%
OK, so that's when
you start waking up.

00:18:32.290 --> 00:18:33.870 align:middle line:10%
That's when things
start connecting.

00:18:33.870 --> 00:18:37.260 align:middle line:84%
You're like, [SIGHS]
could this really be?

00:18:37.260 --> 00:18:39.880 align:middle line:84%
Oh, my goodness, see
those are those points.

00:18:39.880 --> 00:18:41.500 align:middle line:90%
And we have them all the time.

00:18:41.500 --> 00:18:44.610 align:middle line:10%
It doesn't matter where you are
on this whole waking up thing,

00:18:44.610 --> 00:18:46.270 align:middle line:10%
you're always getting more.

00:18:46.270 --> 00:18:48.000 align:middle line:10%
There is no one that's--

00:18:48.000 --> 00:18:49.890 align:middle line:10%
I think when you're
fully awakened you're not

00:18:49.890 --> 00:18:50.890 align:middle line:10%
going to be here anymore.

00:18:50.890 --> 00:18:52.270 align:middle line:84%
I think it's we're
always learning.

00:18:52.270 --> 00:18:53.145 align:middle line:90%
We're always growing.

00:18:53.145 --> 00:18:56.190 align:middle line:84%
We're always wondering
more in this life.

00:18:56.190 --> 00:18:57.370 align:middle line:90%
What is it here?

00:18:57.370 --> 00:18:59.850 align:middle line:84%
But we're doing it now
in a conscious state.

00:18:59.850 --> 00:19:02.550 align:middle line:90%
That's hugely different.

00:19:02.550 --> 00:19:05.610 align:middle line:84%
Would you agree that's different
than wandering around aimlessly

00:19:05.610 --> 00:19:07.180 align:middle line:90%
and getting hit all the time?

00:19:07.180 --> 00:19:09.550 align:middle line:84%
Why is this always
happening to me?

00:19:09.550 --> 00:19:10.860 align:middle line:90%
Oh, I am such a victim.

00:19:10.860 --> 00:19:13.110 align:middle line:84%
All these people are hurting
me, and all these people,

00:19:13.110 --> 00:19:15.070 align:middle line:84%
these things they
keep happening.

00:19:15.070 --> 00:19:16.290 align:middle line:90%
Why?

00:19:16.290 --> 00:19:20.010 align:middle line:84%
When we realize we
are the ones doing it.

00:19:20.010 --> 00:19:24.200 align:middle line:90%
We created it to what?

00:19:24.200 --> 00:19:25.130 align:middle line:90%
Learn.

00:19:25.130 --> 00:19:26.040 align:middle line:90%
What are we learning?

00:19:26.040 --> 00:19:27.630 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to have
you guys teach this.

00:19:27.630 --> 00:19:28.750 align:middle line:90%
What are we learning?

00:19:28.750 --> 00:19:29.810 align:middle line:90%
>> Patience.

00:19:29.810 --> 00:19:30.680 align:middle line:90%
>> Patience.

00:19:30.680 --> 00:19:31.480 align:middle line:90%
>> Patience, love.

00:19:31.480 --> 00:19:33.300 align:middle line:90%
>> Love, unconditional love.

00:19:33.300 --> 00:19:35.540 align:middle line:90%
>> [INDISTINCT]

00:19:35.540 --> 00:19:36.340 align:middle line:90%
>> I'm sorry.

00:19:36.340 --> 00:19:37.710 align:middle line:90%
>> You create your own reality

00:19:37.710 --> 00:19:39.390 align:middle line:90%
>> You create your own reality.

00:19:39.390 --> 00:19:41.430 align:middle line:84%
Yes, I heard something
else over here.

00:19:41.430 --> 00:19:42.323 align:middle line:90%
>> Forgiveness.

00:19:42.323 --> 00:19:43.490 align:middle line:90%
>> Forgiveness is a big one.

00:19:43.490 --> 00:19:43.750 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHS]

00:19:43.750 --> 00:19:45.210 align:middle line:84%
>> We are learning
that we are God.

00:19:45.210 --> 00:19:46.930 align:middle line:84%
>> We are learning
that we are God.

00:19:46.930 --> 00:19:49.620 align:middle line:90%
Exactly isn't that huge?

00:19:49.620 --> 00:19:52.320 align:middle line:84%
And it takes-- sometimes
that's what it takes to wake

00:19:52.320 --> 00:19:54.400 align:middle line:90%
us up is this crazy stuff.

00:19:54.400 --> 00:19:57.430 align:middle line:84%
When we finally go, what
the [BLEEP] is going on?

00:19:57.430 --> 00:19:58.230 align:middle line:90%
Why?

00:19:58.230 --> 00:19:59.820 align:middle line:84%
And that's when
you're going, ah,

00:19:59.820 --> 00:20:03.810 align:middle line:84%
so you have a level of surrender
when you get to that point.

00:20:03.810 --> 00:20:08.107 align:middle line:84%
When that happens, now you
can receive information.

00:20:08.107 --> 00:20:09.690 align:middle line:84%
Remember what I said
at the beginning,

00:20:09.690 --> 00:20:10.860 align:middle line:90%
it's allowing the stuff in.

00:20:10.860 --> 00:20:12.390 align:middle line:84%
That's when you
start allowing it.

00:20:12.390 --> 00:20:14.863 align:middle line:84%
You stop all this,
I'm going to make it.

00:20:14.863 --> 00:20:16.030 align:middle line:90%
I'm going to make it happen.

00:20:16.030 --> 00:20:17.110 align:middle line:84%
I got to do this,
and I got to do that.

00:20:17.110 --> 00:20:18.900 align:middle line:84%
And it's like, it's
not about that at all.

00:20:18.900 --> 00:20:22.720 align:middle line:84%
You're already doing that, and
now it's about, what am I doing?

00:20:22.720 --> 00:20:23.890 align:middle line:90%
What am I learning from it?

00:20:23.890 --> 00:20:25.150 align:middle line:90%
What am I creating.

00:20:25.150 --> 00:20:27.580 align:middle line:84%
And now can I do
in this other way

00:20:27.580 --> 00:20:29.370 align:middle line:90%
that's a nice, beautiful flow.

00:20:29.370 --> 00:20:33.040 align:middle line:90%
We don't force anything.

00:20:33.040 --> 00:20:36.050 align:middle line:84%
Your life was already set
up before you came in.

00:20:36.050 --> 00:20:36.860 align:middle line:90%
You guys know that?

00:20:36.860 --> 00:20:37.660 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:20:37.660 --> 00:20:38.660 align:middle line:90%
>> OK, good.

00:20:38.660 --> 00:20:39.210 align:middle line:90%
Good.

00:20:39.210 --> 00:20:40.835 align:middle line:84%
I'm not saying anything
you don't know.

00:20:40.835 --> 00:20:42.190 align:middle line:90%
OK, so and this--

00:20:42.190 --> 00:20:44.150 align:middle line:84%
so let's go to
this next picture.

00:20:44.150 --> 00:20:46.190 align:middle line:90%
And this was another--

00:20:46.190 --> 00:20:48.400 align:middle line:84%
I put an apology
out for my drawings.

00:20:48.400 --> 00:20:50.420 align:middle line:84%
I'm not an artist,
and you know that now.

00:20:50.420 --> 00:20:52.840 align:middle line:84%
I was not ever trained
in drawing anything.

00:20:52.840 --> 00:20:54.380 align:middle line:90%
They gave me these pictures.

00:20:54.380 --> 00:20:55.810 align:middle line:90%
OK, I'm sorry.

00:20:55.810 --> 00:20:57.870 align:middle line:84%
They don't pick
artists all the time.

00:20:57.870 --> 00:20:58.670 align:middle line:90%
All right.

00:20:58.670 --> 00:21:01.430 align:middle line:90%


00:21:01.430 --> 00:21:04.360 align:middle line:90%
So anyway, I understand visuals.

00:21:04.360 --> 00:21:07.100 align:middle line:84%
So it could be that's why
I keep getting pictures,

00:21:07.100 --> 00:21:08.240 align:middle line:90%
and then they go draw it.

00:21:08.240 --> 00:21:11.740 align:middle line:84%
And I'm like, do you know
who you're talking to?

00:21:11.740 --> 00:21:13.570 align:middle line:84%
They're like, no,
you need to draw it.

00:21:13.570 --> 00:21:16.425 align:middle line:90%
And so anyway, but let's--

00:21:16.425 --> 00:21:22.470 align:middle line:90%


00:21:22.470 --> 00:21:25.215 align:middle line:90%
anybody know what that is?

00:21:25.215 --> 00:21:26.200 align:middle line:90%
>> A maze.

00:21:26.200 --> 00:21:27.000 align:middle line:90%
>> A maze.

00:21:27.000 --> 00:21:27.900 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, see, she cheated.

00:21:27.900 --> 00:21:28.700 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:21:28.700 --> 00:21:32.640 align:middle line:84%
OK, everybody know
what a maze is?

00:21:32.640 --> 00:21:34.390 align:middle line:84%
And they've got these
really tall walls.

00:21:34.390 --> 00:21:39.330 align:middle line:84%
It might be made of the
shrubs or sometimes they

00:21:39.330 --> 00:21:41.400 align:middle line:90%
put the corn mazes.

00:21:41.400 --> 00:21:42.660 align:middle line:90%
They have the corn stalks.

00:21:42.660 --> 00:21:43.900 align:middle line:90%
You can't see over them.

00:21:43.900 --> 00:21:47.010 align:middle line:84%
And when you're in
it on ground level,

00:21:47.010 --> 00:21:48.760 align:middle line:84%
you can just see
where you're going,

00:21:48.760 --> 00:21:51.210 align:middle line:84%
and you could get
lost very easily.

00:21:51.210 --> 00:21:52.660 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:21:52.660 --> 00:21:54.160 align:middle line:84%
So this is the
drawing that gave me,

00:21:54.160 --> 00:21:57.450 align:middle line:84%
and they said, well, look
at this as a blueprint

00:21:57.450 --> 00:21:58.645 align:middle line:90%
that you came in with.

00:21:58.645 --> 00:22:01.270 align:middle line:84%
When you came in, you had things
that you wanted to accomplish.

00:22:01.270 --> 00:22:03.870 align:middle line:84%
Your higher self,
remember, having experience

00:22:03.870 --> 00:22:07.020 align:middle line:84%
called you has certain
things it wants to accomplish

00:22:07.020 --> 00:22:08.460 align:middle line:90%
for your own growth.

00:22:08.460 --> 00:22:10.240 align:middle line:90%
This is choice you made.

00:22:10.240 --> 00:22:11.943 align:middle line:84%
So we create this
blueprint of things

00:22:11.943 --> 00:22:13.360 align:middle line:84%
that you would
like to accomplish.

00:22:13.360 --> 00:22:14.940 align:middle line:84%
There are certain
specific things

00:22:14.940 --> 00:22:18.190 align:middle line:84%
that must happen that
are part of that plan.

00:22:18.190 --> 00:22:21.000 align:middle line:84%
Other things you can
experience along the way.

00:22:21.000 --> 00:22:23.250 align:middle line:84%
Those are might be things
that you're creating or just

00:22:23.250 --> 00:22:26.260 align:middle line:84%
having these wonderful
experiences to learn from.

00:22:26.260 --> 00:22:28.060 align:middle line:84%
All experiences
are to learn from.

00:22:28.060 --> 00:22:33.950 align:middle line:84%
So what's the
objective of a maze?

00:22:33.950 --> 00:22:38.880 align:middle line:84%
So here's saying, get
out, there's the in.

00:22:38.880 --> 00:22:41.330 align:middle line:90%
And then here's the out.

00:22:41.330 --> 00:22:44.150 align:middle line:90%
We want to get through it.

00:22:44.150 --> 00:22:48.030 align:middle line:90%
Does that sound similar to life?

00:22:48.030 --> 00:22:49.980 align:middle line:84%
We come in, and we're
going to go out.

00:22:49.980 --> 00:22:51.640 align:middle line:84%
We're going to go
out at some point.

00:22:51.640 --> 00:22:53.670 align:middle line:84%
It's different for
every single person.

00:22:53.670 --> 00:22:55.400 align:middle line:90%
You also choose that.

00:22:55.400 --> 00:22:56.900 align:middle line:90%
You choose the exit point.

00:22:56.900 --> 00:22:59.550 align:middle line:84%
That's chosen before
you ever come in.

00:22:59.550 --> 00:23:01.850 align:middle line:84%
So to even think that
you can control that,

00:23:01.850 --> 00:23:02.990 align:middle line:90%
we can to some degree.

00:23:02.990 --> 00:23:04.615 align:middle line:84%
Apparently that's
getting more and more

00:23:04.615 --> 00:23:06.617 align:middle line:84%
that we can choose to add
I want to stay longer.

00:23:06.617 --> 00:23:07.950 align:middle line:90%
I have more things I want to do.

00:23:07.950 --> 00:23:10.140 align:middle line:84%
That is something
that you can do.

00:23:10.140 --> 00:23:12.480 align:middle line:90%
But you had a plan.

00:23:12.480 --> 00:23:15.930 align:middle line:84%
And everybody that goes,
they had a plan as well.

00:23:15.930 --> 00:23:17.460 align:middle line:84%
I don't know who
needs to hear this.

00:23:17.460 --> 00:23:19.050 align:middle line:90%
This is very important.

00:23:19.050 --> 00:23:24.410 align:middle line:84%
Everyone, no one leaves one
second before it was time.

00:23:24.410 --> 00:23:26.670 align:middle line:90%
Never.

00:23:26.670 --> 00:23:28.980 align:middle line:90%
When it's time, they will go.

00:23:28.980 --> 00:23:31.500 align:middle line:84%
And the same with
each one of us.

00:23:31.500 --> 00:23:34.170 align:middle line:84%
When it's time on that
other level, we know.

00:23:34.170 --> 00:23:37.440 align:middle line:84%
The conscious level, I
think gets clues maybe.

00:23:37.440 --> 00:23:38.560 align:middle line:90%
It maybe helps prepare.

00:23:38.560 --> 00:23:40.330 align:middle line:84%
It depends on what
you're wanting to do.

00:23:40.330 --> 00:23:42.460 align:middle line:84%
And I'm getting all my
truth bumps right now.

00:23:42.460 --> 00:23:46.680 align:middle line:84%
So whoever is needing
this, I feel you.

00:23:46.680 --> 00:23:51.780 align:middle line:84%
And I want you to
know it was right.

00:23:51.780 --> 00:23:53.460 align:middle line:90%
They were ready.

00:23:53.460 --> 00:23:55.090 align:middle line:90%
And you're OK.

00:23:55.090 --> 00:23:56.620 align:middle line:90%
And they're OK.

00:23:56.620 --> 00:23:57.420 align:middle line:90%
All right.

00:23:57.420 --> 00:24:02.670 align:middle line:90%
They're OK But this is our life.

00:24:02.670 --> 00:24:05.590 align:middle line:84%
Now, we have certain things
that we want to accomplish.

00:24:05.590 --> 00:24:07.260 align:middle line:84%
So I'm going to
mark those in here.

00:24:07.260 --> 00:24:11.370 align:middle line:84%
We might come in and say,
give me some life events

00:24:11.370 --> 00:24:12.640 align:middle line:90%
that might happen in the life.

00:24:12.640 --> 00:24:13.586 align:middle line:90%
Just some examples.

00:24:13.586 --> 00:24:14.400 align:middle line:90%
>> Motherhood.

00:24:14.400 --> 00:24:16.620 align:middle line:84%
>> Motherhood,
that what I heard?

00:24:16.620 --> 00:24:18.420 align:middle line:84%
OK, so we might
have that, are we

00:24:18.420 --> 00:24:20.460 align:middle line:84%
going to get married
before then or?

00:24:20.460 --> 00:24:21.480 align:middle line:90%
Maybe.

00:24:21.480 --> 00:24:22.830 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:24:22.830 --> 00:24:23.770 align:middle line:90%
It doesn't have to.

00:24:23.770 --> 00:24:24.790 align:middle line:90%
I'm just wondering.

00:24:24.790 --> 00:24:30.010 align:middle line:84%
>> [INDISTINCT] I had a
plan, but it didn't work out.

00:24:30.010 --> 00:24:30.810 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:24:30.810 --> 00:24:31.630 align:middle line:90%
Or maybe not.

00:24:31.630 --> 00:24:32.610 align:middle line:90%
Maybe that was your plan.

00:24:32.610 --> 00:24:33.410 align:middle line:90%
I mean, you know.

00:24:33.410 --> 00:24:34.920 align:middle line:84%
[LAUGHTER] OK, so
we're just going

00:24:34.920 --> 00:24:36.820 align:middle line:84%
to go with
motherhood, all right.

00:24:36.820 --> 00:24:38.640 align:middle line:90%
So I'll just mark that in here.

00:24:38.640 --> 00:24:39.550 align:middle line:90%
OK, what else?

00:24:39.550 --> 00:24:40.350 align:middle line:90%
>> Career.

00:24:40.350 --> 00:24:41.150 align:middle line:90%
>> Career.

00:24:41.150 --> 00:24:43.320 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:24:43.320 --> 00:24:46.470 align:middle line:84%
We'll put it-- we want it
before or after motherhood?

00:24:46.470 --> 00:24:47.370 align:middle line:90%
>> Before.

00:24:47.370 --> 00:24:48.170 align:middle line:90%
>> Before.

00:24:48.170 --> 00:24:50.220 align:middle line:90%
So we'll mark it down here.

00:24:50.220 --> 00:24:52.788 align:middle line:90%
All right.

00:24:52.788 --> 00:24:54.330 align:middle line:84%
And that's funny
that you say divorce

00:24:54.330 --> 00:24:58.693 align:middle line:84%
because I was thinking about
it this morning because I think

00:24:58.693 --> 00:25:01.360 align:middle line:84%
I've said one time I was like, I
don't know if divorce is always

00:25:01.360 --> 00:25:02.980 align:middle line:84%
in the plan, but this
morning, I was like,

00:25:02.980 --> 00:25:05.063 align:middle line:84%
yeah, it can be in the
plan because how much do we

00:25:05.063 --> 00:25:07.510 align:middle line:90%
grow in a breakup?

00:25:07.510 --> 00:25:09.850 align:middle line:84%
It's like, OK, we might
have agreements with people

00:25:09.850 --> 00:25:11.770 align:middle line:84%
that, OK, I'm going
to be with you

00:25:11.770 --> 00:25:13.690 align:middle line:90%
for a certain amount of time.

00:25:13.690 --> 00:25:15.950 align:middle line:84%
We're going to learn whatever
we can to learn from.

00:25:15.950 --> 00:25:18.410 align:middle line:84%
We're going to learn from each
other, and then we will go.

00:25:18.410 --> 00:25:20.510 align:middle line:84%
This will not be a
lifetime contract.

00:25:20.510 --> 00:25:22.810 align:middle line:84%
We will only be together for
a certain period of time,

00:25:22.810 --> 00:25:24.580 align:middle line:90%
and then we will part.

00:25:24.580 --> 00:25:28.373 align:middle line:84%
And in that parting, we will
learn X, Y, and Z. Also,

00:25:28.373 --> 00:25:29.540 align:middle line:90%
we're going to get together.

00:25:29.540 --> 00:25:30.740 align:middle line:84%
We're going to have this
wonderful time together.

00:25:30.740 --> 00:25:31.250 align:middle line:90%
We're going to learn.

00:25:31.250 --> 00:25:32.542 align:middle line:90%
We're going to help each other.

00:25:32.542 --> 00:25:33.890 align:middle line:90%
And then it's time.

00:25:33.890 --> 00:25:37.400 align:middle line:84%
We will know when it's time,
and hopefully, we'll be OK.

00:25:37.400 --> 00:25:40.010 align:middle line:84%
I mean, on that level, we're
like, oh, yeah, no problem.

00:25:40.010 --> 00:25:41.440 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, we'll just go.

00:25:41.440 --> 00:25:42.280 align:middle line:90%
Good deal.

00:25:42.280 --> 00:25:43.940 align:middle line:90%
Here how does it look?

00:25:43.940 --> 00:25:48.730 align:middle line:84%
[GROANING] What are
you doing to me?

00:25:48.730 --> 00:25:51.130 align:middle line:90%
How dare you crush me?

00:25:51.130 --> 00:25:53.870 align:middle line:90%
It was in the plan.

00:25:53.870 --> 00:25:55.970 align:middle line:90%
Just these plans we make.

00:25:55.970 --> 00:25:56.770 align:middle line:90%
All right.

00:25:56.770 --> 00:25:59.150 align:middle line:84%
Remember, we're great
and powerful beings.

00:25:59.150 --> 00:26:00.830 align:middle line:90%
We are master manifestors.

00:26:00.830 --> 00:26:03.680 align:middle line:84%
We knew what we
were getting into.

00:26:03.680 --> 00:26:05.740 align:middle line:84%
And I remember long
ago when I had some

00:26:05.740 --> 00:26:07.930 align:middle line:90%
of that craziness happening.

00:26:07.930 --> 00:26:12.430 align:middle line:84%
It was like, gosh, I must have
really thought a lot of myself

00:26:12.430 --> 00:26:14.300 align:middle line:84%
to put myself in
these positions.

00:26:14.300 --> 00:26:16.400 align:middle line:84%
But this is how
we learn and grow.

00:26:16.400 --> 00:26:18.055 align:middle line:90%
OK, so just trust.

00:26:18.055 --> 00:26:20.120 align:middle line:84%
Oh, they're saying
trust, trust, trust.

00:26:20.120 --> 00:26:21.850 align:middle line:84%
Trust yourself for
what you're doing.

00:26:21.850 --> 00:26:24.100 align:middle line:84%
Trust yourself for what you
did, and what you planned,

00:26:24.100 --> 00:26:25.400 align:middle line:90%
and what you're still doing.

00:26:25.400 --> 00:26:25.690 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:26:25.690 --> 00:26:26.510 align:middle line:90%
Trust.

00:26:26.510 --> 00:26:28.310 align:middle line:90%
Trust you, trust the universe.

00:26:28.310 --> 00:26:29.150 align:middle line:90%
There is a plan.

00:26:29.150 --> 00:26:30.070 align:middle line:90%
It's all good.

00:26:30.070 --> 00:26:30.940 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:26:30.940 --> 00:26:31.520 align:middle line:90%
All right.

00:26:31.520 --> 00:26:32.390 align:middle line:90%
So what other things?

00:26:32.390 --> 00:26:34.015 align:middle line:84%
We have career, and
we have motherhood.

00:26:34.015 --> 00:26:37.440 align:middle line:84%
>> Premature loss
of a loved one.

00:26:37.440 --> 00:26:38.240 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:26:38.240 --> 00:26:39.720 align:middle line:90%
Oh, that motherhood, the child.

00:26:39.720 --> 00:26:40.520 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:26:40.520 --> 00:26:41.520 align:middle line:90%
[INDISTINCT]

00:26:41.520 --> 00:26:43.390 align:middle line:84%
>> OK, that's because
that's tough one.

00:26:43.390 --> 00:26:44.633 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, that's tough.

00:26:44.633 --> 00:26:46.050 align:middle line:84%
>> [INDISTINCT]
would be a lesson.

00:26:46.050 --> 00:26:48.010 align:middle line:90%
>> Absolutely it'll be a lesson.

00:26:48.010 --> 00:26:51.120 align:middle line:84%
And we always think, oh,
my gosh, how can that be?

00:26:51.120 --> 00:26:53.020 align:middle line:90%
How can God take babies?

00:26:53.020 --> 00:26:54.542 align:middle line:90%
How can it happen?

00:26:54.542 --> 00:26:57.000 align:middle line:84%
I brought this child into this
world, why are they leaving?

00:26:57.000 --> 00:26:58.667 align:middle line:84%
And see that's what
I was talking about.

00:26:58.667 --> 00:27:04.230 align:middle line:84%
No one, no one ever
leaves one second

00:27:04.230 --> 00:27:06.790 align:middle line:84%
before they're ready,
before it's time.

00:27:06.790 --> 00:27:07.870 align:middle line:90%
Even a child.

00:27:07.870 --> 00:27:10.260 align:middle line:84%
We have to remember
that children are great,

00:27:10.260 --> 00:27:14.530 align:middle line:84%
big grown-up souls, they're
just housed in a little body.

00:27:14.530 --> 00:27:15.330 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:27:15.330 --> 00:27:19.260 align:middle line:84%
Always remember, they're big
grown-up soul with a plan.

00:27:19.260 --> 00:27:21.435 align:middle line:84%
And they have an agreement
when they come in, oh,

00:27:21.435 --> 00:27:23.220 align:middle line:90%
my god, my whole body is just--

00:27:23.220 --> 00:27:25.737 align:middle line:84%
when they come in,
it's like, OK, mom,

00:27:25.737 --> 00:27:28.320 align:middle line:84%
dad-- this is all these meetings
on the other side-- mom, dad,

00:27:28.320 --> 00:27:30.792 align:middle line:84%
whoever else is in the
family, I'm going to come in.

00:27:30.792 --> 00:27:31.750 align:middle line:90%
We're going to do this.

00:27:31.750 --> 00:27:33.390 align:middle line:90%
I'm going to help you.

00:27:33.390 --> 00:27:34.710 align:middle line:90%
You're needing this.

00:27:34.710 --> 00:27:35.885 align:middle line:90%
Whatever the plan is, OK.

00:27:35.885 --> 00:27:37.510 align:middle line:84%
We're going to do
this for your growth.

00:27:37.510 --> 00:27:40.680 align:middle line:84%
And then I'm going
to leave early

00:27:40.680 --> 00:27:44.220 align:middle line:84%
because you wanted to
learn X, Y, or Z. Maybe

00:27:44.220 --> 00:27:48.820 align:middle line:84%
they want to understand
separation something about loss.

00:27:48.820 --> 00:27:51.730 align:middle line:90%
And that's a really--

00:27:51.730 --> 00:27:56.500 align:middle line:84%
OK, let's pull this all the
way back, all emotions removed.

00:27:56.500 --> 00:28:02.990 align:middle line:84%
But wouldn't that be a fantastic
way to learn about loss?

00:28:02.990 --> 00:28:04.770 align:middle line:84%
OK When you're in
the middle of it,

00:28:04.770 --> 00:28:06.570 align:middle line:84%
no, I can't say
that to somebody.

00:28:06.570 --> 00:28:07.950 align:middle line:90%
You're in the emotions of it.

00:28:07.950 --> 00:28:09.500 align:middle line:84%
And I want you to be
in the emotions of it

00:28:09.500 --> 00:28:11.500 align:middle line:84%
because that's why you
came here to planet Earth

00:28:11.500 --> 00:28:13.310 align:middle line:90%
was to experience emotions.

00:28:13.310 --> 00:28:16.790 align:middle line:84%
And I want you to feel those
emotions because that's

00:28:16.790 --> 00:28:19.310 align:middle line:84%
what's helping you to
learn and understand

00:28:19.310 --> 00:28:21.710 align:middle line:90%
about that lesson loss.

00:28:21.710 --> 00:28:24.710 align:middle line:84%
So just it's OK to
have the emotions.

00:28:24.710 --> 00:28:29.360 align:middle line:84%
And then afterwards now
when you feel ready,

00:28:29.360 --> 00:28:33.110 align:middle line:84%
then you can get to that point
and go, OK, what was that about?

00:28:33.110 --> 00:28:34.570 align:middle line:90%
Why did that happen?

00:28:34.570 --> 00:28:35.370 align:middle line:90%
All right.

00:28:35.370 --> 00:28:36.870 align:middle line:84%
So then you can ask
those questions.

00:28:36.870 --> 00:28:39.660 align:middle line:84%
And that there's a certain
point there you feel emotions.

00:28:39.660 --> 00:28:41.310 align:middle line:84%
Let yourself feel
those emotions.

00:28:41.310 --> 00:28:42.110 align:middle line:90%
All right.

00:28:42.110 --> 00:28:44.510 align:middle line:84%
That's very important
because many of our illnesses

00:28:44.510 --> 00:28:47.010 align:middle line:84%
are from where we will
not express our emotions.

00:28:47.010 --> 00:28:49.290 align:middle line:84%
We hold them in, and
we lock them down.

00:28:49.290 --> 00:28:50.160 align:middle line:90%
No, I can't cry.

00:28:50.160 --> 00:28:50.970 align:middle line:90%
I can't feel sorry.

00:28:50.970 --> 00:28:51.420 align:middle line:90%
I can't.

00:28:51.420 --> 00:28:52.350 align:middle line:90%
I have to be strong.

00:28:52.350 --> 00:28:53.150 align:middle line:90%
I have to all that.

00:28:53.150 --> 00:28:57.530 align:middle line:84%
And it gets stuck, and
it creates illness.

00:28:57.530 --> 00:28:59.190 align:middle line:90%
OK all right.

00:28:59.190 --> 00:29:03.190 align:middle line:90%
So we'll put that one over here.

00:29:03.190 --> 00:29:04.650 align:middle line:90%
All right, let's go.

00:29:04.650 --> 00:29:05.560 align:middle line:90%
Those are heavy ones.

00:29:05.560 --> 00:29:06.670 align:middle line:90%
So let's just stay with those.

00:29:06.670 --> 00:29:07.470 align:middle line:90%
All right.

00:29:07.470 --> 00:29:11.760 align:middle line:84%
So we're coming into this
life, and we're ready to go.

00:29:11.760 --> 00:29:12.843 align:middle line:90%
And like, OK, we got this.

00:29:12.843 --> 00:29:14.427 align:middle line:84%
The guidance team,
they're saying, OK,

00:29:14.427 --> 00:29:15.870 align:middle line:84%
we're going to be
there with you.

00:29:15.870 --> 00:29:17.520 align:middle line:90%
You're going to forget.

00:29:17.520 --> 00:29:19.270 align:middle line:84%
You got to remember--
you got to remember,

00:29:19.270 --> 00:29:20.228 align:middle line:90%
you're going to forget.

00:29:20.228 --> 00:29:21.385 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:29:21.385 --> 00:29:23.980 align:middle line:84%
They're like, you need
to-- oh, no problem.

00:29:23.980 --> 00:29:24.880 align:middle line:90%
I got this.

00:29:24.880 --> 00:29:27.060 align:middle line:90%
It's a piece of cake.

00:29:27.060 --> 00:29:28.390 align:middle line:90%
I do this all the time.

00:29:28.390 --> 00:29:30.210 align:middle line:90%
No problem.

00:29:30.210 --> 00:29:33.790 align:middle line:84%
Emotions, love, hate,
all those good things.

00:29:33.790 --> 00:29:36.430 align:middle line:84%
Jealousy, any of
those, ah, no problem.

00:29:36.430 --> 00:29:37.580 align:middle line:90%
I've studied them.

00:29:37.580 --> 00:29:38.380 align:middle line:90%
I've studied them.

00:29:38.380 --> 00:29:39.897 align:middle line:84%
I know what I'm
getting myself into.

00:29:39.897 --> 00:29:41.980 align:middle line:84%
I love all these people
I'm getting involved with.

00:29:41.980 --> 00:29:43.840 align:middle line:84%
They're the ones I
work with all the time.

00:29:43.840 --> 00:29:45.895 align:middle line:90%
I got this.

00:29:45.895 --> 00:29:47.020 align:middle line:90%
But you're going to forget.

00:29:47.020 --> 00:29:47.770 align:middle line:90%
OK, I know, I know.

00:29:47.770 --> 00:29:48.010 align:middle line:90%
I know.

00:29:48.010 --> 00:29:48.940 align:middle line:84%
But you're going
to be there, right?

00:29:48.940 --> 00:29:49.810 align:middle line:90%
You're going to be helping me?

00:29:49.810 --> 00:29:51.130 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, yeah, we're going
to be guiding you.

00:29:51.130 --> 00:29:52.380 align:middle line:90%
We're going to be helping you.

00:29:52.380 --> 00:29:53.670 align:middle line:90%
OK, I got this.

00:29:53.670 --> 00:29:55.560 align:middle line:84%
All right, well,
you figure out, this

00:29:55.560 --> 00:29:58.140 align:middle line:84%
is an agreement we
make before coming in.

00:29:58.140 --> 00:30:00.510 align:middle line:84%
They're going to be
finding ways to communicate

00:30:00.510 --> 00:30:05.190 align:middle line:84%
to us because we're
not going to remember.

00:30:05.190 --> 00:30:07.978 align:middle line:84%
If we don't remember that,
we don't remember who we are,

00:30:07.978 --> 00:30:10.020 align:middle line:84%
we probably aren't going
to remember that we even

00:30:10.020 --> 00:30:12.750 align:middle line:84%
have a guidance team up until
the point that we realize it.

00:30:12.750 --> 00:30:14.970 align:middle line:84%
We don't remember
that we can hear them,

00:30:14.970 --> 00:30:18.150 align:middle line:90%
and they are there helping us.

00:30:18.150 --> 00:30:22.230 align:middle line:84%
I want you to look around
at the general population.

00:30:22.230 --> 00:30:23.290 align:middle line:90%
You guys are special.

00:30:23.290 --> 00:30:24.090 align:middle line:90%
See, you guys know.

00:30:24.090 --> 00:30:25.420 align:middle line:90%
You've got a leg up.

00:30:25.420 --> 00:30:27.780 align:middle line:84%
All right, you already
are knowing this.

00:30:27.780 --> 00:30:30.330 align:middle line:84%
But the general population
doesn't necessarily

00:30:30.330 --> 00:30:31.870 align:middle line:90%
know these things, right?

00:30:31.870 --> 00:30:34.250 align:middle line:10%
So that's where it
can be difficult.

00:30:34.250 --> 00:30:37.200 align:middle line:84%
And they just don't understand
why these things are happening.

00:30:37.200 --> 00:30:39.100 align:middle line:90%
You planned it.

00:30:39.100 --> 00:30:41.040 align:middle line:84%
You came in, but you
have this guidance team

00:30:41.040 --> 00:30:42.730 align:middle line:90%
who's always ready to help you.

00:30:42.730 --> 00:30:43.990 align:middle line:90%
All right, so we're coming in.

00:30:43.990 --> 00:30:45.610 align:middle line:84%
We're going to come
down the chute.

00:30:45.610 --> 00:30:47.270 align:middle line:90%
We know how it works, right?

00:30:47.270 --> 00:30:48.270 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:30:48.270 --> 00:30:50.910 align:middle line:84%
We come in, and we're
going on our path.

00:30:50.910 --> 00:30:52.380 align:middle line:90%
All right, and then we go in.

00:30:52.380 --> 00:30:54.490 align:middle line:90%
And OK, we got the first one.

00:30:54.490 --> 00:30:55.760 align:middle line:90%
Ding, ding, ding, ding.

00:30:55.760 --> 00:30:56.560 align:middle line:90%
You got it.

00:30:56.560 --> 00:30:57.190 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, OK.

00:30:57.190 --> 00:30:57.970 align:middle line:90%
What was that one?

00:30:57.970 --> 00:30:58.770 align:middle line:90%
That was--

00:30:58.770 --> 00:30:59.610 align:middle line:90%
>> Motherhood.

00:30:59.610 --> 00:31:00.070 align:middle line:90%
>> Motherhood.

00:31:00.070 --> 00:31:00.510 align:middle line:90%
Was that?

00:31:00.510 --> 00:31:01.230 align:middle line:90%
>> Career.

00:31:01.230 --> 00:31:01.840 align:middle line:90%
>> Career.

00:31:01.840 --> 00:31:02.710 align:middle line:90%
We got the career.

00:31:02.710 --> 00:31:03.600 align:middle line:90%
Woohoo!

00:31:03.600 --> 00:31:04.540 align:middle line:90%
Yay!

00:31:04.540 --> 00:31:06.120 align:middle line:90%
Piece of cake.

00:31:06.120 --> 00:31:07.630 align:middle line:90%
Having fun.

00:31:07.630 --> 00:31:11.880 align:middle line:84%
All right, go on down the road
a little bit more, motherhood.

00:31:11.880 --> 00:31:13.425 align:middle line:84%
OK, that was just
how I planned it.

00:31:13.425 --> 00:31:13.680 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHS]

00:31:13.680 --> 00:31:14.550 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:31:14.550 --> 00:31:16.620 align:middle line:90%
Woohoo!

00:31:16.620 --> 00:31:17.490 align:middle line:90%
All right.

00:31:17.490 --> 00:31:20.220 align:middle line:84%
Yes, on this level, we don't
know we planned it that way.

00:31:20.220 --> 00:31:22.170 align:middle line:84%
On that level, yeah, I'm going
to do it without somebody.

00:31:22.170 --> 00:31:23.760 align:middle line:84%
OK, we're going to just
keep going this way.

00:31:23.760 --> 00:31:24.560 align:middle line:90%
All right.

00:31:24.560 --> 00:31:25.980 align:middle line:90%
Super.

00:31:25.980 --> 00:31:29.400 align:middle line:90%
All right, so we're going.

00:31:29.400 --> 00:31:30.250 align:middle line:90%
I got this.

00:31:30.250 --> 00:31:31.720 align:middle line:90%
This is fun.

00:31:31.720 --> 00:31:35.810 align:middle line:84%
No problem then oh, my
gosh, what was that one?

00:31:35.810 --> 00:31:36.610 align:middle line:90%
The child.

00:31:36.610 --> 00:31:38.035 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, loss of the child.

00:31:38.035 --> 00:31:38.835 align:middle line:90%
Whoa!

00:31:38.835 --> 00:31:41.370 align:middle line:90%


00:31:41.370 --> 00:31:43.570 align:middle line:90%
This isn't fun anymore.

00:31:43.570 --> 00:31:44.450 align:middle line:90%
It's not so easy.

00:31:44.450 --> 00:31:45.700 align:middle line:90%
I don't know what's happening.

00:31:45.700 --> 00:31:46.617 align:middle line:90%
Why is this happening?

00:31:46.617 --> 00:31:48.020 align:middle line:90%
What's going on?

00:31:48.020 --> 00:31:49.590 align:middle line:90%
Oh, my gosh.

00:31:49.590 --> 00:31:52.530 align:middle line:90%
So now I don't know what to do.

00:31:52.530 --> 00:31:54.010 align:middle line:90%
I don't know what to do.

00:31:54.010 --> 00:31:57.560 align:middle line:84%
One thing I forgot to write is
we wanted another event over

00:31:57.560 --> 00:31:58.360 align:middle line:90%
here.

00:31:58.360 --> 00:31:59.650 align:middle line:10%
This is what I always see.

00:31:59.650 --> 00:32:02.611 align:middle line:84%
I don't know what it
is, but it's something.

00:32:02.611 --> 00:32:06.357 align:middle line:84%
But anyway, and then we
start wandering around,

00:32:06.357 --> 00:32:07.690 align:middle line:90%
and I don't know what I'm doing.

00:32:07.690 --> 00:32:10.790 align:middle line:90%
Anybody ever been in that place?

00:32:10.790 --> 00:32:13.280 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, it's like
what's happening?

00:32:13.280 --> 00:32:15.740 align:middle line:84%
And what tends to
happen when you're kind

00:32:15.740 --> 00:32:17.700 align:middle line:90%
of in doing that kind of stuff?

00:32:17.700 --> 00:32:20.100 align:middle line:90%
>> Asking questions.

00:32:20.100 --> 00:32:21.350 align:middle line:90%
>> You start asking questions.

00:32:21.350 --> 00:32:22.380 align:middle line:90%
You make bad decisions.

00:32:22.380 --> 00:32:24.053 align:middle line:84%
The thing is, we
tend to get stuck.

00:32:24.053 --> 00:32:26.470 align:middle line:84%
And that could be where the
bad decisions are coming from.

00:32:26.470 --> 00:32:27.928 align:middle line:84%
Things like where
we're just stuck.

00:32:27.928 --> 00:32:28.980 align:middle line:90%
We don't know what to do.

00:32:28.980 --> 00:32:32.000 align:middle line:84%
And that's when
our guidance team

00:32:32.000 --> 00:32:34.882 align:middle line:84%
has got to come in
strong because we

00:32:34.882 --> 00:32:36.090 align:middle line:90%
don't know where we're going.

00:32:36.090 --> 00:32:37.632 align:middle line:84%
We don't know what
we're doing right.

00:32:37.632 --> 00:32:38.570 align:middle line:90%
We're off track.

00:32:38.570 --> 00:32:39.873 align:middle line:90%
Many times, we're not going.

00:32:39.873 --> 00:32:41.040 align:middle line:90%
We're not on a path anymore.

00:32:41.040 --> 00:32:43.250 align:middle line:84%
We're just wandering
around and, like you said,

00:32:43.250 --> 00:32:44.445 align:middle line:90%
making bad decisions.

00:32:44.445 --> 00:32:45.570 align:middle line:90%
Who knows what we're doing?

00:32:45.570 --> 00:32:49.700 align:middle line:84%
We're doing things that are
not on our planned path.

00:32:49.700 --> 00:32:51.410 align:middle line:84%
So this is where
the guidance team

00:32:51.410 --> 00:32:55.460 align:middle line:84%
has to come in and help
get us back on track.

00:32:55.460 --> 00:32:57.890 align:middle line:90%
OK, what are some ways--

00:32:57.890 --> 00:33:00.740 align:middle line:84%
leaving the body out
of it, not illness,

00:33:00.740 --> 00:33:03.380 align:middle line:84%
anything like that-- what are
some ways that you might think

00:33:03.380 --> 00:33:06.110 align:middle line:84%
or that you have seen yourself
that you have been communicated

00:33:06.110 --> 00:33:09.900 align:middle line:84%
with by just any way that
you've received messages?

00:33:09.900 --> 00:33:10.760 align:middle line:90%
>> Dreams.

00:33:10.760 --> 00:33:11.560 align:middle line:90%
>> Dreams.

00:33:11.560 --> 00:33:13.810 align:middle line:84%
And I'm going to go back
here, and I'm going to write.

00:33:13.810 --> 00:33:14.730 align:middle line:90%
And you're going to--

00:33:14.730 --> 00:33:15.550 align:middle line:90%
>> Intuition.

00:33:15.550 --> 00:33:16.430 align:middle line:90%
>> Intuition.

00:33:16.430 --> 00:33:17.360 align:middle line:90%
>> Children.

00:33:17.360 --> 00:33:18.240 align:middle line:90%
>> Children.

00:33:18.240 --> 00:33:19.040 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:33:19.040 --> 00:33:20.230 align:middle line:90%
How do children?

00:33:20.230 --> 00:33:21.780 align:middle line:90%
>> They teach us so much.

00:33:21.780 --> 00:33:22.980 align:middle line:90%
>> They do teach us so much.

00:33:22.980 --> 00:33:23.910 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:33:23.910 --> 00:33:25.030 align:middle line:90%
Animals.

00:33:25.030 --> 00:33:27.818 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, people, how many
times have you just.

00:33:27.818 --> 00:33:29.860 align:middle line:84%
Somebody just walked up
to you and said something

00:33:29.860 --> 00:33:31.020 align:middle line:90%
I was like, oh, my gosh.

00:33:31.020 --> 00:33:31.895 align:middle line:90%
>> Strange encounters

00:33:31.895 --> 00:33:32.905 align:middle line:90%
>> Strange encounters.

00:33:32.905 --> 00:33:34.030 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, that's what I needed.

00:33:34.030 --> 00:33:35.980 align:middle line:84%
I needed to hear
that exact thing.

00:33:35.980 --> 00:33:38.710 align:middle line:84%
This is how this
and so many more.

00:33:38.710 --> 00:33:40.450 align:middle line:90%
I mean, we have radio.

00:33:40.450 --> 00:33:41.940 align:middle line:90%
Do we still have radio?

00:33:41.940 --> 00:33:44.380 align:middle line:90%
OK, I don't know anymore.

00:33:44.380 --> 00:33:48.150 align:middle line:90%
OK, TV, books.

00:33:48.150 --> 00:33:49.670 align:middle line:90%
>> Psychedelics.

00:33:49.670 --> 00:33:50.470 align:middle line:90%
>> Psychedelics.

00:33:50.470 --> 00:33:51.930 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:33:51.930 --> 00:33:52.810 align:middle line:90%
I heard over here--

00:33:52.810 --> 00:33:53.610 align:middle line:90%
>> Social media.

00:33:53.610 --> 00:33:55.450 align:middle line:90%
>> --social media.

00:33:55.450 --> 00:33:57.520 align:middle line:84%
And that right there
is a whole animal.

00:33:57.520 --> 00:34:01.140 align:middle line:84%
It includes so many
different things.

00:34:01.140 --> 00:34:03.360 align:middle line:90%
OK yes, I could.

00:34:03.360 --> 00:34:05.380 align:middle line:84%
OK I'm going to see if
I can spell it right.

00:34:05.380 --> 00:34:06.180 align:middle line:90%
Psycho--

00:34:06.180 --> 00:34:08.605 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:34:08.605 --> 00:34:09.480 align:middle line:90%


00:34:09.480 --> 00:34:10.920 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:34:10.920 --> 00:34:14.225 align:middle line:84%
But OK, so we get messages
in a lot of different ways.

00:34:14.225 --> 00:34:15.600 align:middle line:84%
And that's what
they have told me

00:34:15.600 --> 00:34:19.760 align:middle line:84%
is they are constantly,
constantly communicating

00:34:19.760 --> 00:34:20.560 align:middle line:90%
with us.

00:34:20.560 --> 00:34:22.570 align:middle line:90%
Constantly sending messages.

00:34:22.570 --> 00:34:25.120 align:middle line:84%
So, see, they're
constantly talking to us.

00:34:25.120 --> 00:34:29.370 align:middle line:84%
It's whether or not we will
listen because we get here

00:34:29.370 --> 00:34:30.270 align:middle line:90%
and what?

00:34:30.270 --> 00:34:31.389 align:middle line:90%
We forget.

00:34:31.389 --> 00:34:33.210 align:middle line:90%
We forget that we can hear them.

00:34:33.210 --> 00:34:36.850 align:middle line:84%
And if you don't believe you can
hear them, will you hear them?

00:34:36.850 --> 00:34:37.650 align:middle line:90%
>> No.

00:34:37.650 --> 00:34:39.150 align:middle line:90%
>> No.

00:34:39.150 --> 00:34:41.670 align:middle line:84%
Because your belief is
always out ahead of you.

00:34:41.670 --> 00:34:45.570 align:middle line:84%
Whatever you believe is
what's creating your reality.

00:34:45.570 --> 00:34:48.670 align:middle line:84%
Somebody needs to hear that your
beliefs dictate your reality.

00:34:48.670 --> 00:34:52.650 align:middle line:84%
OK, so if you do not believe
that you can hear them,

00:34:52.650 --> 00:34:54.787 align:middle line:90%
then you will not.

00:34:54.787 --> 00:34:56.620 align:middle line:84%
So they're going to
have to find another way

00:34:56.620 --> 00:34:58.090 align:middle line:90%
to communicate with you.

00:34:58.090 --> 00:35:02.750 align:middle line:84%
And that maze I drew, maybe
you're in the thick of it.

00:35:02.750 --> 00:35:05.590 align:middle line:84%
You're walking through
these walls or yeah.

00:35:05.590 --> 00:35:07.630 align:middle line:84%
But your higher self,
your guidance team

00:35:07.630 --> 00:35:09.305 align:middle line:90%
has that overview, what you had.

00:35:09.305 --> 00:35:10.430 align:middle line:90%
That's how they can see it.

00:35:10.430 --> 00:35:11.860 align:middle line:84%
They can see exactly
where you are

00:35:11.860 --> 00:35:15.050 align:middle line:84%
on the path where you're
supposed to be, what's going on.

00:35:15.050 --> 00:35:17.720 align:middle line:84%
And they're like, oh, my
God, beep, beep, beep.

00:35:17.720 --> 00:35:19.040 align:middle line:90%
They're off track.

00:35:19.040 --> 00:35:21.880 align:middle line:90%
We got to do something.

00:35:21.880 --> 00:35:26.870 align:middle line:90%
So you're not listening.

00:35:26.870 --> 00:35:28.050 align:middle line:90%
They've tried everything.

00:35:28.050 --> 00:35:28.860 align:middle line:90%
They've been talking to you.

00:35:28.860 --> 00:35:29.960 align:middle line:84%
They've been talking
to other people, all

00:35:29.960 --> 00:35:31.380 align:middle line:90%
these other different things.

00:35:31.380 --> 00:35:33.800 align:middle line:84%
And then now it's like, look,
you're still not listening.

00:35:33.800 --> 00:35:38.480 align:middle line:84%
So they're going to go to
something that you are with 24/7

00:35:38.480 --> 00:35:42.000 align:middle line:84%
seven, 24 hours a day, seven
days a week, 365 days a year.

00:35:42.000 --> 00:35:43.380 align:middle line:90%
And what is that?

00:35:43.380 --> 00:35:44.180 align:middle line:90%
>> The body.

00:35:44.180 --> 00:35:44.980 align:middle line:90%
>> The body.

00:35:44.980 --> 00:35:45.910 align:middle line:90%
Oh, I can move now.

00:35:45.910 --> 00:35:47.060 align:middle line:90%
[EXHALES]

00:35:47.060 --> 00:35:49.280 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:35:49.280 --> 00:35:50.960 align:middle line:90%
I love to move.

00:35:50.960 --> 00:35:52.820 align:middle line:84%
This is hard to just
stand in one spot.

00:35:52.820 --> 00:35:56.033 align:middle line:84%
They're going to
talk to the body.

00:35:56.033 --> 00:35:58.200 align:middle line:84%
They're going to use the
body to get your attention.

00:35:58.200 --> 00:36:00.010 align:middle line:84%
It's always about
getting your attention.

00:36:00.010 --> 00:36:04.197 align:middle line:84%
Once they got your
attention, now it's

00:36:04.197 --> 00:36:06.780 align:middle line:84%
like you're something shifts,
and now information can come in.

00:36:06.780 --> 00:36:08.180 align:middle line:84%
It may not be that
you hear them yet,

00:36:08.180 --> 00:36:09.840 align:middle line:84%
but, at least, they
got your attention.

00:36:09.840 --> 00:36:11.760 align:middle line:90%
That's the beginning place.

00:36:11.760 --> 00:36:13.430 align:middle line:84%
And then what I
want to show you is

00:36:13.430 --> 00:36:15.240 align:middle line:84%
because I don't know
if they understand,

00:36:15.240 --> 00:36:16.320 align:middle line:90%
maybe they don't realize.

00:36:16.320 --> 00:36:17.320 align:middle line:90%
I don't know what it is.

00:36:17.320 --> 00:36:18.950 align:middle line:84%
It's like there's a
translation manual

00:36:18.950 --> 00:36:23.010 align:middle line:84%
that I've created because that
didn't come when we came in.

00:36:23.010 --> 00:36:25.535 align:middle line:84%
It's like we didn't get
that as far as we're

00:36:25.535 --> 00:36:28.160 align:middle line:84%
going to be talking to you, and
we're going to choose this now.

00:36:28.160 --> 00:36:31.363 align:middle line:90%
And then we didn't know that.

00:36:31.363 --> 00:36:33.030 align:middle line:84%
We didn't know they're
using our bodies.

00:36:33.030 --> 00:36:36.440 align:middle line:84%
It took different things to
finally connect the points

00:36:36.440 --> 00:36:37.920 align:middle line:90%
that this is what's happening.

00:36:37.920 --> 00:36:38.720 align:middle line:90%
So this is where--

00:36:38.720 --> 00:36:40.178 align:middle line:84%
I'm just going to
help you shortcut

00:36:40.178 --> 00:36:41.870 align:middle line:90%
the system a little bit.

00:36:41.870 --> 00:36:43.730 align:middle line:84%
Louise Hay was
the first one that

00:36:43.730 --> 00:36:46.590 align:middle line:84%
started recognizing-- that I'm
aware of was the first one.

00:36:46.590 --> 00:36:49.470 align:middle line:84%
It's like my gosh,
these mean things,

00:36:49.470 --> 00:36:52.760 align:middle line:84%
and then, I'm just
standing on her shoulders.

00:36:52.760 --> 00:36:53.730 align:middle line:90%
It's gone farther.

00:36:53.730 --> 00:36:55.210 align:middle line:90%
I've expanded on it.

00:36:55.210 --> 00:36:57.210 align:middle line:84%
What I have gotten
from my mother's work,

00:36:57.210 --> 00:36:59.670 align:middle line:90%
it just opens it up wider.

00:36:59.670 --> 00:37:03.700 align:middle line:84%
So it's more that we can
understand and more to do there.

00:37:03.700 --> 00:37:05.490 align:middle line:84%
It's not so much
just affirmations.

00:37:05.490 --> 00:37:07.590 align:middle line:84%
And not to put down
anything about affirmations.

00:37:07.590 --> 00:37:08.410 align:middle line:90%
They're wonderful.

00:37:08.410 --> 00:37:10.350 align:middle line:84%
It's just you can
get directly what

00:37:10.350 --> 00:37:12.810 align:middle line:84%
the information is that
they're trying to get to you.

00:37:12.810 --> 00:37:17.410 align:middle line:84%
It's not you guessing and
trying to do all the work.

00:37:17.410 --> 00:37:20.580 align:middle line:84%
You can get exactly what
it is, and then it's done.

00:37:20.580 --> 00:37:23.930 align:middle line:90%
