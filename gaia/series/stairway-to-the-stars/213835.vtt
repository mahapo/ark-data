00:00:04.329 --> 00:00:11.560 align:middle line:90%


00:00:11.560 --> 00:00:15.220 align:middle line:84%
>> This is the hope and
promise of Tibetan Buddhism,

00:00:15.220 --> 00:00:18.860 align:middle line:84%
of the Christian prophecies,
of the Transfiguration.

00:00:18.860 --> 00:00:22.840 align:middle line:84%
This is what they said would
be happening in an end time.

00:00:22.840 --> 00:00:28.060 align:middle line:84%
We would recover tones,
lights, plants, even an oil.

00:00:28.060 --> 00:00:30.310 align:middle line:10%
Gnostic Christianity
speaks of an oil

00:00:30.310 --> 00:00:33.520 align:middle line:10%
that will manifest at the
end times that will probably

00:00:33.520 --> 00:00:36.730 align:middle line:10%
pour out of the cosmos
like manna or dew

00:00:36.730 --> 00:00:40.030 align:middle line:10%
that will transfigure
the entire human race.

00:00:40.030 --> 00:00:42.380 align:middle line:84%
I think we're on the
cusp of that right now.

00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:45.940 align:middle line:84%
If not the cusp, maybe
we're actually in it.

00:00:45.940 --> 00:00:49.060 align:middle line:10%
If you think of the two circles
interpenetrating one another

00:00:49.060 --> 00:00:51.250 align:middle line:10%
and they create that
almond-shaped zone,

00:00:51.250 --> 00:00:54.850 align:middle line:10%
the mandorla, the doorway,
the portal in between,

00:00:54.850 --> 00:00:56.920 align:middle line:10%
I think we're in the doorway.

00:00:56.920 --> 00:00:58.300 align:middle line:10%
Amen?

00:00:58.300 --> 00:00:59.260 align:middle line:90%
You feel that way, too?

00:00:59.260 --> 00:01:00.060 align:middle line:90%
OK, good.

00:01:00.060 --> 00:01:00.860 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:03.520 align:middle line:84%
So that means now we've got
to up level our understanding

00:01:03.520 --> 00:01:05.370 align:middle line:90%
of what this portal is about.

00:01:05.370 --> 00:01:08.390 align:middle line:84%
What we're to be doing
while we're in this portal.

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:10.060 align:middle line:84%
And what I'm asking
you to consider

00:01:10.060 --> 00:01:13.670 align:middle line:90%
is that, that's our North Star.

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:17.060 align:middle line:84%
I'm not going to say this is
perhaps the ultimate answer,

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:20.060 align:middle line:84%
but if you're wandering
around out here,

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:22.010 align:middle line:84%
you're on the
stairway to the stars

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:25.590 align:middle line:84%
and you're looking
down, look up.

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:26.390 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:28.890 align:middle line:90%
That's north right there.

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:32.960 align:middle line:10%
Anything that you can
do relative to unfolding

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:35.690 align:middle line:10%
this divine aspect of
yourself, your rainbow light

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:39.050 align:middle line:10%
body, your glory body, your
transfiguration body, that

00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:41.270 align:middle line:10%
is going to get you home.

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:44.300 align:middle line:10%
Following this will
get you to the place

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:46.230 align:middle line:10%
you ultimately want to be.

00:01:46.230 --> 00:01:51.410 align:middle line:10%
And I often like to reference
Michaelangelo when people

00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:53.340 align:middle line:10%
ask, well, how do I do that?

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:54.990 align:middle line:90%
Tell me what I need to do?

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:58.110 align:middle line:84%
It's individually specific
is partly my answer.

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:01.820 align:middle line:10%
However, generally, I
refer to Michelangelo,

00:02:01.820 --> 00:02:05.720 align:middle line:10%
who was looking at a block
of marble, and he said,

00:02:05.720 --> 00:02:10.759 align:middle line:10%
"I saw the angel in the marble
and carved until I set him

00:02:10.759 --> 00:02:12.875 align:middle line:10%
free."

00:02:12.875 --> 00:02:16.490 align:middle line:10%
That angel, that light
being is within you.

00:02:16.490 --> 00:02:18.650 align:middle line:10%
It's covered over by
false perceptions,

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:22.890 align:middle line:10%
by negative perceptions, by
lack of knowledge, perhaps.

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:25.560 align:middle line:10%
But now you know
what is within you.

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:29.760 align:middle line:10%
And now the task becomes
not mummifying yourself

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:34.460 align:middle line:10%
with Silicon Valley technology,
covering it up even more,

00:02:34.460 --> 00:02:36.290 align:middle line:10%
it's setting it free.

00:02:36.290 --> 00:02:37.370 align:middle line:90%
Setting it free.

00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:38.870 align:middle line:90%
Allowing it to be.

00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:41.120 align:middle line:84%
Connecting with it,
maybe through an image,

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:43.920 align:middle line:84%
maybe through a text,
maybe through an idea.

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:46.990 align:middle line:84%
Just an inspiration
that, yeah, OK.

00:02:46.990 --> 00:02:50.660 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to follow this North
Star, see where it leads me.

00:02:50.660 --> 00:02:53.300 align:middle line:10%
And just start
looking at your life

00:02:53.300 --> 00:02:56.420 align:middle line:10%
and think about
everything in your life

00:02:56.420 --> 00:03:00.050 align:middle line:10%
and ask the question,
well, what does it have

00:03:00.050 --> 00:03:03.080 align:middle line:10%
to do with my transfiguration?

00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:04.250 align:middle line:90%
I've got this.

00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:06.860 align:middle line:84%
i Love Gibson electric
guitars and I've

00:03:06.860 --> 00:03:08.460 align:middle line:90%
got a wonderful collection.

00:03:08.460 --> 00:03:12.460 align:middle line:10%
And I look at that and I
realize I can't take it with me.

00:03:12.460 --> 00:03:13.870 align:middle line:10%
Yeah.

00:03:13.870 --> 00:03:16.090 align:middle line:10%
I'm not going to let
that go until the very

00:03:16.090 --> 00:03:19.170 align:middle line:10%
last moment in my life.

00:03:19.170 --> 00:03:22.560 align:middle line:84%
Well, until holding
hope that maybe they

00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:26.640 align:middle line:84%
will find a way that I can
take away because the angels do

00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:27.960 align:middle line:90%
play guitars.

00:03:27.960 --> 00:03:30.370 align:middle line:10%
You notice this in
all kinds of artwork.

00:03:30.370 --> 00:03:34.920 align:middle line:10%
They are totally
playing guitars.

00:03:34.920 --> 00:03:38.830 align:middle line:10%
But I look at that
and think, OK, it's

00:03:38.830 --> 00:03:41.650 align:middle line:10%
not a waste of my time to play
that guitar because when I am

00:03:41.650 --> 00:03:44.280 align:middle line:10%
playing, I'm trying to channel.

00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:47.000 align:middle line:84%
I'm trying to bring in
new tunes and tones.

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:49.660 align:middle line:84%
What if I could create
a song that would

00:03:49.660 --> 00:03:51.610 align:middle line:90%
help to make people happy?

00:03:51.610 --> 00:03:54.010 align:middle line:10%
That would go to
the transfiguration?

00:03:54.010 --> 00:03:57.190 align:middle line:10%
So that's an example of looking
at something in my life that

00:03:57.190 --> 00:04:01.220 align:middle line:10%
says, OK, does this serve
me on this pathway here?

00:04:01.220 --> 00:04:04.370 align:middle line:84%
Or perhaps do I just
need to let that go?

00:04:04.370 --> 00:04:06.650 align:middle line:10%
And we have to do
that, be willing to do

00:04:06.650 --> 00:04:10.400 align:middle line:10%
that in all areas of our life
because so many of the objects

00:04:10.400 --> 00:04:14.240 align:middle line:10%
and ideas and things that
preoccupy our time ultimately

00:04:14.240 --> 00:04:16.880 align:middle line:10%
are really not serving us.

00:04:16.880 --> 00:04:20.180 align:middle line:10%
So it takes some
bravery and some courage

00:04:20.180 --> 00:04:21.575 align:middle line:10%
to look at ourselves.

00:04:21.575 --> 00:04:23.450 align:middle line:84%
And I'm not saying go
home and sell your home

00:04:23.450 --> 00:04:26.190 align:middle line:84%
and get rid of your car
and all that kind of stuff.

00:04:26.190 --> 00:04:27.390 align:middle line:90%
We have to do it.

00:04:27.390 --> 00:04:30.770 align:middle line:84%
We have to transfigure within
the construct of our matrix

00:04:30.770 --> 00:04:32.500 align:middle line:90%
that we're in.

00:04:32.500 --> 00:04:35.510 align:middle line:84%
We're in this
matrix for a reason.

00:04:35.510 --> 00:04:38.283 align:middle line:84%
But the point is, is
that I'm sure you would

00:04:38.283 --> 00:04:39.950 align:middle line:84%
agree that there are
things in your life

00:04:39.950 --> 00:04:41.800 align:middle line:90%
that are not serving this.

00:04:41.800 --> 00:04:43.490 align:middle line:90%
It could be dietary.

00:04:43.490 --> 00:04:44.520 align:middle line:90%
It could be mental.

00:04:44.520 --> 00:04:47.060 align:middle line:84%
It could be physical,
spiritual, emotional.

00:04:47.060 --> 00:04:49.130 align:middle line:84%
Evaluate those
things in your life.

00:04:49.130 --> 00:04:51.900 align:middle line:84%
Look at them and say, well,
maybe I'm going to let that go.

00:04:51.900 --> 00:04:54.950 align:middle line:10%
And now think about
some new things

00:04:54.950 --> 00:04:57.650 align:middle line:10%
that you can bring into
your life that will

00:04:57.650 --> 00:05:00.050 align:middle line:10%
serve your transfiguration.

00:05:00.050 --> 00:05:04.990 align:middle line:84%
We all are on this path of
remembering our true self.

00:05:04.990 --> 00:05:07.950 align:middle line:84%
And this is a message that
I take great comfort in,

00:05:07.950 --> 00:05:11.620 align:middle line:84%
is that I don't have to
reinvent all of this.

00:05:11.620 --> 00:05:14.480 align:middle line:84%
In fact, we've
already done this.

00:05:14.480 --> 00:05:18.350 align:middle line:84%
It's a process of
remembering who we truly are,

00:05:18.350 --> 00:05:20.880 align:middle line:84%
and that part of
our self is there.

00:05:20.880 --> 00:05:25.600 align:middle line:84%
And now that you're aware of it,
you can begin to call upon it.

00:05:25.600 --> 00:05:28.860 align:middle line:84%
It can be as simple as saying
higher self, ascended self,

00:05:28.860 --> 00:05:31.630 align:middle line:90%
tell me what to do next.

00:05:31.630 --> 00:05:33.850 align:middle line:90%
Setting up a dream intention.

00:05:33.850 --> 00:05:36.970 align:middle line:84%
Incorporating an idea like
that into your meditation.

00:05:36.970 --> 00:05:39.170 align:middle line:90%
Listening to that voice.

00:05:39.170 --> 00:05:42.380 align:middle line:90%
And acting on what it says.

00:05:42.380 --> 00:05:45.400 align:middle line:84%
And I'm pretty well convinced
that you all are already

00:05:45.400 --> 00:05:47.650 align:middle line:84%
hearing that voice,
but you're just

00:05:47.650 --> 00:05:51.255 align:middle line:84%
procrastinating on doing
what it's telling you to do.

00:05:51.255 --> 00:05:53.745 align:middle line:84%
You already know what you need
to do, but you're thinking,

00:05:53.745 --> 00:05:55.770 align:middle line:90%
oh, I'll do that when.

00:05:55.770 --> 00:05:58.230 align:middle line:84%
Maybe you want to flip
that a little bit.

00:05:58.230 --> 00:06:02.520 align:middle line:10%
Procrastination is not
serving in many instances,

00:06:02.520 --> 00:06:06.290 align:middle line:10%
but doing the things that
we're procrastinating on doing

00:06:06.290 --> 00:06:09.470 align:middle line:10%
will completely
change the situation.

00:06:09.470 --> 00:06:12.430 align:middle line:10%
Because you might be thinking
sometimes I do this too.

00:06:12.430 --> 00:06:15.950 align:middle line:84%
What is the next best
thing that I can do?

00:06:15.950 --> 00:06:20.210 align:middle line:84%
Well, maybe the next best thing
is simply to do something.

00:06:20.210 --> 00:06:23.570 align:middle line:10%
Instead of standing still
and not doing anything,

00:06:23.570 --> 00:06:26.150 align:middle line:10%
it could be a simple
little action,

00:06:26.150 --> 00:06:29.000 align:middle line:10%
like drinking more
water, less coffee

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:32.970 align:middle line:10%
will do it because that's
going to alter my chemistry.

00:06:32.970 --> 00:06:34.350 align:middle line:10%
It's going to alter my thinking.

00:06:34.350 --> 00:06:36.420 align:middle line:10%
It's going to alter everything.

00:06:36.420 --> 00:06:39.300 align:middle line:84%
And this is what we're
ultimately aiming at here.

00:06:39.300 --> 00:06:43.340 align:middle line:84%
And by doing that, I've served
my physical self, but also

00:06:43.340 --> 00:06:47.150 align:middle line:84%
my higher self, because
I've actually listened.

00:06:47.150 --> 00:06:48.390 align:middle line:90%
So it's within us.

00:06:48.390 --> 00:06:50.300 align:middle line:84%
And this is the drama
that was unfolded,

00:06:50.300 --> 00:06:53.720 align:middle line:84%
of course, in the
story of Jacob,

00:06:53.720 --> 00:06:58.520 align:middle line:84%
who's a famous questor,
who in the Old Testament

00:06:58.520 --> 00:07:02.310 align:middle line:84%
wrestled with an angel
at a place called Penuel.

00:07:02.310 --> 00:07:04.980 align:middle line:84%
And many have noted
that, that word Penuel

00:07:04.980 --> 00:07:08.940 align:middle line:84%
is a homophone for pineal, like
the pineal gland in the center

00:07:08.940 --> 00:07:11.250 align:middle line:84%
of our brain, the
manufacturing plant that

00:07:11.250 --> 00:07:15.000 align:middle line:84%
produces all of these
secretions that transfigure

00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:16.450 align:middle line:90%
our body into light.

00:07:16.450 --> 00:07:20.020 align:middle line:84%
So really, the game is about
getting into the temple here.

00:07:20.020 --> 00:07:22.770 align:middle line:84%
We're not concerned
about temples out here.

00:07:22.770 --> 00:07:24.690 align:middle line:84%
It's all in the temple
between our ears

00:07:24.690 --> 00:07:28.410 align:middle line:84%
and learning how to
navigate that and utilize

00:07:28.410 --> 00:07:30.030 align:middle line:90%
what's within us.

00:07:30.030 --> 00:07:34.230 align:middle line:84%
So Jacob wrestles with
this angel at Penuel.

00:07:34.230 --> 00:07:36.030 align:middle line:84%
And one interpretation
of that would

00:07:36.030 --> 00:07:38.860 align:middle line:84%
be that he's actually just
wrestling with his higher self.

00:07:38.860 --> 00:07:41.400 align:middle line:84%
This is his earthly
self wrestling

00:07:41.400 --> 00:07:43.720 align:middle line:90%
with his angelic higher self.

00:07:43.720 --> 00:07:45.700 align:middle line:84%
And it's not so much
a wrestling match,

00:07:45.700 --> 00:07:48.010 align:middle line:90%
rather it's like the caduceus.

00:07:48.010 --> 00:07:52.320 align:middle line:84%
It's bringing them into
alignment with one another.

00:07:52.320 --> 00:07:54.270 align:middle line:84%
And the way we bring
them into alignment

00:07:54.270 --> 00:07:58.080 align:middle line:84%
is by getting them both to
say yes to the same thing.

00:07:58.080 --> 00:08:01.390 align:middle line:84%
I mean, we all have those
dual aspects within ourselves.

00:08:01.390 --> 00:08:03.710 align:middle line:84%
One part says yes,
one part says no.

00:08:03.710 --> 00:08:06.920 align:middle line:84%
And when we're in that
state, where are we going?

00:08:06.920 --> 00:08:08.890 align:middle line:90%
We're going nowhere.

00:08:08.890 --> 00:08:11.800 align:middle line:84%
The object is to get them
flipped up, both saying yes

00:08:11.800 --> 00:08:13.480 align:middle line:90%
to the same thing.

00:08:13.480 --> 00:08:15.100 align:middle line:10%
What I'm asking
you to consider is

00:08:15.100 --> 00:08:19.090 align:middle line:10%
that what we want to say yes
to is our transfiguration

00:08:19.090 --> 00:08:22.790 align:middle line:10%
into our true self,
the rainbow light body.

00:08:22.790 --> 00:08:26.440 align:middle line:84%
And once again, it
may seem extreme to be

00:08:26.440 --> 00:08:28.640 align:middle line:84%
able to attain that
in one lifetime

00:08:28.640 --> 00:08:31.150 align:middle line:84%
as the Dalai Lama would tell
you, if he were standing here,

00:08:31.150 --> 00:08:32.662 align:middle line:84%
you could do this
in one lifetime.

00:08:32.662 --> 00:08:34.120 align:middle line:84%
He would also say
you probably have

00:08:34.120 --> 00:08:36.010 align:middle line:84%
been incarnating
thousands of lifetimes

00:08:36.010 --> 00:08:37.760 align:middle line:90%
in order to be able to do this.

00:08:37.760 --> 00:08:41.059 align:middle line:90%
And now is the best time.

00:08:41.059 --> 00:08:44.570 align:middle line:10%
For some reason, these teachings
are now present on our planet

00:08:44.570 --> 00:08:46.730 align:middle line:10%
in a global way, such
that they have never

00:08:46.730 --> 00:08:48.660 align:middle line:10%
been before in human history.

00:08:48.660 --> 00:08:50.340 align:middle line:84%
I know this because
I'm a historian.

00:08:50.340 --> 00:08:51.620 align:middle line:90%
I document this.

00:08:51.620 --> 00:08:54.030 align:middle line:84%
For the first time
in human history,

00:08:54.030 --> 00:08:58.760 align:middle line:84%
hundreds of millions of people
are practicing yoga, meditation,

00:08:58.760 --> 00:09:03.440 align:middle line:84%
dietary regimes, rainbow
light body teachings,

00:09:03.440 --> 00:09:05.570 align:middle line:84%
all aimed at their
transfiguration

00:09:05.570 --> 00:09:06.500 align:middle line:90%
into a higher state.

00:09:06.500 --> 00:09:09.320 align:middle line:84%
This has never happened
in human history.

00:09:09.320 --> 00:09:10.940 align:middle line:90%
We're special.

00:09:10.940 --> 00:09:13.670 align:middle line:84%
This is a very,
very special time.

00:09:13.670 --> 00:09:17.420 align:middle line:10%
And my advice is to
find a way to utilize it

00:09:17.420 --> 00:09:21.120 align:middle line:10%
in any way you possibly can.

00:09:21.120 --> 00:09:24.730 align:middle line:10%
To achieve illumination or
experience, Buddha nature,

00:09:24.730 --> 00:09:26.640 align:middle line:10%
the transfiguration,
the Buddhist

00:09:26.640 --> 00:09:29.490 align:middle line:10%
teach we have to meditate
on the blue pearl.

00:09:29.490 --> 00:09:32.230 align:middle line:10%
That again is the
pineal gland within us.

00:09:32.230 --> 00:09:36.990 align:middle line:10%
And they suggest a
chant Om Mani Padme Hum.

00:09:36.990 --> 00:09:38.790 align:middle line:10%
Om Mani Padme Hum.

00:09:38.790 --> 00:09:41.610 align:middle line:10%
The jewel in the heart
of the golden lotus.

00:09:41.610 --> 00:09:46.470 align:middle line:10%
By reciting Om Mani Padme Hum,
we call down divine blessings

00:09:46.470 --> 00:09:51.730 align:middle line:10%
and we activate the
neurosecretory system or pineal

00:09:51.730 --> 00:09:56.800 align:middle line:10%
gland that is capable of
opening up to the light body,

00:09:56.800 --> 00:10:00.460 align:middle line:10%
releasing hormones and molecules
that are capable of bringing

00:10:00.460 --> 00:10:04.600 align:middle line:10%
enhanced states of deep
love, bliss, joy, healing

00:10:04.600 --> 00:10:05.840 align:middle line:10%
to the physical body.

00:10:05.840 --> 00:10:08.800 align:middle line:10%
Reality switches that open
up portals and gateways

00:10:08.800 --> 00:10:11.740 align:middle line:10%
into other realms that
we now are interacting

00:10:11.740 --> 00:10:15.640 align:middle line:10%
with the divine realm and with
beings that have been documented

00:10:15.640 --> 00:10:17.330 align:middle line:10%
throughout human history.

00:10:17.330 --> 00:10:21.370 align:middle line:10%
We're now linked with them
because we put the magic glasses

00:10:21.370 --> 00:10:23.150 align:middle line:10%
on, we took the blinkers off.

00:10:23.150 --> 00:10:26.590 align:middle line:84%
We decided we're going to
use this device, our body,

00:10:26.590 --> 00:10:28.660 align:middle line:90%
for its intended purpose.

00:10:28.660 --> 00:10:31.990 align:middle line:10%
And Buddhist teach that through
regular or prolonged meditation

00:10:31.990 --> 00:10:35.530 align:middle line:10%
on the blue pearl, the
blue sea, we gradually

00:10:35.530 --> 00:10:37.700 align:middle line:10%
will experience our true nature.

00:10:37.700 --> 00:10:41.650 align:middle line:84%
So perhaps this is another
tool that you can incorporate

00:10:41.650 --> 00:10:46.360 align:middle line:84%
into your kit as you're thinking
about my spiritual development,

00:10:46.360 --> 00:10:50.210 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to start utilizing
images such as of the Buddha

00:10:50.210 --> 00:10:52.970 align:middle line:84%
and focusing, meditating
on the blue pearl,

00:10:52.970 --> 00:10:55.310 align:middle line:90%
chanting Om Mani Padme Hum.

00:10:55.310 --> 00:10:58.520 align:middle line:84%
And bringing down
those divine blessings.

00:10:58.520 --> 00:10:59.760 align:middle line:90%
It works.

00:10:59.760 --> 00:11:03.350 align:middle line:10%
It instantly puts you
in a higher frequency

00:11:03.350 --> 00:11:06.390 align:middle line:10%
because you are now tapping
into Buddha consciousness.

00:11:06.390 --> 00:11:11.120 align:middle line:10%
You're tapping into a universal
consciousness that all of us

00:11:11.120 --> 00:11:12.930 align:middle line:10%
have an ability to tap into.

00:11:12.930 --> 00:11:15.080 align:middle line:10%
And by bringing that
into this world,

00:11:15.080 --> 00:11:17.630 align:middle line:10%
we transfigure not only
our earthly selves,

00:11:17.630 --> 00:11:22.170 align:middle line:10%
but we transmute and transfigure
the entire planet itself.

00:11:22.170 --> 00:11:24.210 align:middle line:90%
That's our mission right now.

00:11:24.210 --> 00:11:27.110 align:middle line:84%
We have to be the
ones who are awakened

00:11:27.110 --> 00:11:29.310 align:middle line:90%
that will guide this process.

00:11:29.310 --> 00:11:34.280 align:middle line:84%
Otherwise, I'm not sure what the
consequences are going to be.

00:11:34.280 --> 00:11:37.280 align:middle line:10%
The Buddhists teach a very
important quantum concept,

00:11:37.280 --> 00:11:41.150 align:middle line:10%
and that is, is that the
image puts you in the energy

00:11:41.150 --> 00:11:42.120 align:middle line:10%
field of the Buddha.

00:11:42.120 --> 00:11:44.910 align:middle line:84%
This is we call this
quantum entanglement today.

00:11:44.910 --> 00:11:49.970 align:middle line:84%
The idea is that we're all
entangled at a particle level

00:11:49.970 --> 00:11:53.030 align:middle line:84%
and ultimately at a physical
level with these beings.

00:11:53.030 --> 00:11:56.300 align:middle line:10%
And that through the
image, we can literally

00:11:56.300 --> 00:12:00.530 align:middle line:10%
connect with the Buddha, the
rainbow light body Buddha,

00:12:00.530 --> 00:12:02.630 align:middle line:10%
in this case Padmasambhava.

00:12:02.630 --> 00:12:09.260 align:middle line:10%
And what they teach is that we
and the image of Padmasambhava

00:12:09.260 --> 00:12:11.310 align:middle line:10%
are really two extremes.

00:12:11.310 --> 00:12:15.770 align:middle line:84%
We have flesh and blood bodies,
but not as much compassion

00:12:15.770 --> 00:12:17.070 align:middle line:90%
as we would like to have.

00:12:17.070 --> 00:12:20.720 align:middle line:84%
And he has a body made of
rainbows and boundless,

00:12:20.720 --> 00:12:22.290 align:middle line:90%
impartial compassion.

00:12:22.290 --> 00:12:26.060 align:middle line:10%
When we put these two extremes
together in the rainbow body

00:12:26.060 --> 00:12:29.120 align:middle line:10%
meditation, we move
in the direction

00:12:29.120 --> 00:12:31.760 align:middle line:10%
of manifesting as a being
with flesh and blood

00:12:31.760 --> 00:12:36.590 align:middle line:10%
body and unlimited compassion
with maybe a few rainbows thrown

00:12:36.590 --> 00:12:38.870 align:middle line:10%
in for decoration.

00:12:38.870 --> 00:12:40.940 align:middle line:84%
So here's again
the idea, you might

00:12:40.940 --> 00:12:43.910 align:middle line:84%
think it's extreme to go
full rainbow light body.

00:12:43.910 --> 00:12:45.285 align:middle line:90%
I get that.

00:12:45.285 --> 00:12:46.440 align:middle line:10%
I haven't.

00:12:46.440 --> 00:12:48.790 align:middle line:10%
And here I am still
teaching about it.

00:12:48.790 --> 00:12:52.060 align:middle line:10%
But if we can bring it maybe
to the level of our toes,

00:12:52.060 --> 00:12:54.100 align:middle line:10%
show it off a little
bit in private moments

00:12:54.100 --> 00:12:58.040 align:middle line:10%
with a loved one, that's what
we're talking about here.

00:12:58.040 --> 00:12:59.950 align:middle line:90%
That may be just enough.

00:12:59.950 --> 00:13:02.410 align:middle line:84%
Don Juan taught that
to Carlos Castaneda,

00:13:02.410 --> 00:13:05.450 align:middle line:84%
that you don't have
to go full light body.

00:13:05.450 --> 00:13:10.070 align:middle line:84%
You can just go partial
and that's enough.

00:13:10.070 --> 00:13:13.150 align:middle line:84%
And imagining that we're
just like Padmasambhava

00:13:13.150 --> 00:13:14.553 align:middle line:90%
is not wishful thinking.

00:13:14.553 --> 00:13:15.970 align:middle line:84%
I'm not trying to
convince you you

00:13:15.970 --> 00:13:18.160 align:middle line:84%
can turn yourself
into a Learjet.

00:13:18.160 --> 00:13:22.040 align:middle line:84%
That's basically what Silicon
Valley's wanting to say to you.

00:13:22.040 --> 00:13:26.030 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, buy our latest AI gadget
and turn yourself into a robot.

00:13:26.030 --> 00:13:27.740 align:middle line:84%
That's not what
we're saying here.

00:13:27.740 --> 00:13:33.860 align:middle line:84%
What I'm saying is we can unfold
our true intrinsic nature.

00:13:33.860 --> 00:13:36.590 align:middle line:84%
And that's the
Buddhist perspective.

00:13:36.590 --> 00:13:38.560 align:middle line:84%
And it's shared by
Christianity that has,

00:13:38.560 --> 00:13:42.220 align:middle line:84%
said for 2,000 years that
all of us are in the process

00:13:42.220 --> 00:13:44.240 align:middle line:90%
of transfiguration.

00:13:44.240 --> 00:13:47.050 align:middle line:10%
And at the last
trumpet, as Corinthians

00:13:47.050 --> 00:13:49.840 align:middle line:10%
says, in the twinkling of
an eye at the last trumpet,

00:13:49.840 --> 00:13:52.000 align:middle line:10%
we will be transfigured.

00:13:52.000 --> 00:13:53.930 align:middle line:10%
We will be changed.

00:13:53.930 --> 00:13:57.220 align:middle line:10%
And what they mean by that is
we will be changed into bodies

00:13:57.220 --> 00:14:02.200 align:middle line:10%
of light like Christ, like
Padmasambhava, like Osiris,

00:14:02.200 --> 00:14:06.580 align:middle line:10%
like all the other
ascended beings

00:14:06.580 --> 00:14:08.450 align:middle line:10%
of the various traditions.

00:14:08.450 --> 00:14:11.440 align:middle line:10%
And the idea is
that because we are

00:14:11.440 --> 00:14:13.660 align:middle line:10%
made in the perfect
image of God,

00:14:13.660 --> 00:14:18.280 align:middle line:10%
we have the spiritual capacity
to participate in or mirror

00:14:18.280 --> 00:14:20.920 align:middle line:10%
Jesus's divine glory
as image bearers

00:14:20.920 --> 00:14:24.070 align:middle line:10%
and reactivate our light bodies.

00:14:24.070 --> 00:14:27.110 align:middle line:10%
That's what it's about,
is this reactivation.

00:14:27.110 --> 00:14:28.940 align:middle line:10%
And the Bible is
specific about it.

00:14:28.940 --> 00:14:35.200 align:middle line:10%
It says, as was the man of dust
or carbon, DNA, in other words,

00:14:35.200 --> 00:14:37.750 align:middle line:10%
and as is the man
of heaven, so also

00:14:37.750 --> 00:14:39.290 align:middle line:10%
are those who are of heaven.

00:14:39.290 --> 00:14:42.490 align:middle line:84%
Just as we have borne the
image of the man of dust,

00:14:42.490 --> 00:14:45.380 align:middle line:84%
we shall also bear the
image of the man of heaven.

00:14:45.380 --> 00:14:47.470 align:middle line:10%
We will become star walkers.

00:14:47.470 --> 00:14:50.240 align:middle line:84%
This is the essence
of Christianity.

00:14:50.240 --> 00:14:53.920 align:middle line:10%
It's not taught in any Christian
churches exactly how to do this,

00:14:53.920 --> 00:14:59.780 align:middle line:10%
but they're very plainly stating
that we can become star walkers.

00:14:59.780 --> 00:15:02.650 align:middle line:10%
And the Gospel of
Philip affirms this

00:15:02.650 --> 00:15:04.920 align:middle line:10%
when it says the Lord
rose from the dead.

00:15:04.920 --> 00:15:06.270 align:middle line:10%
He became as he was.

00:15:06.270 --> 00:15:08.720 align:middle line:10%
But now his body
was perfect, which

00:15:08.720 --> 00:15:10.970 align:middle line:10%
means to be more
whole, more holy, more

00:15:10.970 --> 00:15:13.280 align:middle line:10%
complete, and compassionate.

00:15:13.280 --> 00:15:15.150 align:middle line:10%
He possessed flesh.

00:15:15.150 --> 00:15:17.730 align:middle line:10%
But this was true flesh.

00:15:17.730 --> 00:15:20.450 align:middle line:10%
Our flesh isn't true.

00:15:20.450 --> 00:15:24.552 align:middle line:10%
Our flesh is only an
image of the true.

00:15:24.552 --> 00:15:26.510 align:middle line:84%
This is what I was saying
at the very beginning

00:15:26.510 --> 00:15:29.480 align:middle line:84%
of my presentation when I
had that visionary journey

00:15:29.480 --> 00:15:31.890 align:middle line:90%
and saw this magnificent temple.

00:15:31.890 --> 00:15:34.910 align:middle line:10%
The earthly temple
is nothing compared

00:15:34.910 --> 00:15:39.780 align:middle line:10%
to what I saw in its original
form in the celestial realms.

00:15:39.780 --> 00:15:43.700 align:middle line:10%
Same thing with you and I. We
have enfolded within us this

00:15:43.700 --> 00:15:47.330 align:middle line:10%
magnificent being that
until perhaps today we

00:15:47.330 --> 00:15:49.710 align:middle line:10%
have chosen not to acknowledge.

00:15:49.710 --> 00:15:52.670 align:middle line:10%
But once we
acknowledge it, now we

00:15:52.670 --> 00:15:57.330 align:middle line:10%
can recognize that we are only
an image of our true self.

00:15:57.330 --> 00:16:01.250 align:middle line:84%
But we can unfold or
awaken our true self

00:16:01.250 --> 00:16:06.160 align:middle line:84%
and walk the Earth
as star walkers aimed

00:16:06.160 --> 00:16:08.210 align:middle line:90%
at this transfiguration.

00:16:08.210 --> 00:16:11.710 align:middle line:84%
So this is why you see in
Christian Resurrection imagery,

00:16:11.710 --> 00:16:13.850 align:middle line:84%
Jesus resurrected here
with Mary Magdalene.

00:16:13.850 --> 00:16:16.140 align:middle line:90%
She's got her oil jar there.

00:16:16.140 --> 00:16:19.240 align:middle line:84%
I do extensive
work about that oil

00:16:19.240 --> 00:16:23.775 align:middle line:84%
and would encourage you to,
on Gaia, my presentation,

00:16:23.775 --> 00:16:26.260 align:middle line:84%
the myth of the
Marys goes deeply

00:16:26.260 --> 00:16:30.940 align:middle line:84%
into their use of these
esoteric and exotic oils

00:16:30.940 --> 00:16:33.190 align:middle line:90%
of transfiguration.

00:16:33.190 --> 00:16:36.680 align:middle line:10%
And Mary Magdalene is the
one that knew those secrets.

00:16:36.680 --> 00:16:40.630 align:middle line:10%
And over and again, we
see this correspondence

00:16:40.630 --> 00:16:44.080 align:middle line:10%
between the Christian
and the Tibetan

00:16:44.080 --> 00:16:46.720 align:middle line:10%
and the Egyptian imagery.

00:16:46.720 --> 00:16:48.830 align:middle line:10%
The Rainbow Bridge shows
up everywhere, though.

00:16:48.830 --> 00:16:53.260 align:middle line:10%
This is the Bifrost bridge
of the Nordic tradition.

00:16:53.260 --> 00:16:55.390 align:middle line:10%
The bridge between
Asgard and Midgard,

00:16:55.390 --> 00:16:56.900 align:middle line:10%
the burning Rainbow Bridge.

00:16:56.900 --> 00:16:58.210 align:middle line:10%
It shows up there.

00:16:58.210 --> 00:17:01.840 align:middle line:10%
And it always refers
to these avatars,

00:17:01.840 --> 00:17:06.170 align:middle line:10%
descent of higher beings
that come down a stairway.

00:17:06.170 --> 00:17:08.640 align:middle line:10%
We are on a stairway
to the stars.

00:17:08.640 --> 00:17:09.960 align:middle line:10%
Why?

00:17:09.960 --> 00:17:12.210 align:middle line:90%
To meet them.

00:17:12.210 --> 00:17:14.819 align:middle line:10%
They are not just
going to show up

00:17:14.819 --> 00:17:18.420 align:middle line:10%
in a room full of people that
don't have any clue who they are

00:17:18.420 --> 00:17:22.560 align:middle line:10%
or where they came from or what
is going on, in my opinion.

00:17:22.560 --> 00:17:26.250 align:middle line:10%
From my study of these
various traditions,

00:17:26.250 --> 00:17:31.620 align:middle line:10%
they always say humans have
to rise up to meet them.

00:17:31.620 --> 00:17:33.540 align:middle line:84%
That's the point
of this conference,

00:17:33.540 --> 00:17:36.280 align:middle line:84%
is to be on this
stairway to the stars,

00:17:36.280 --> 00:17:39.060 align:middle line:84%
where we can expand our
consciousness, open our hearts,

00:17:39.060 --> 00:17:43.970 align:middle line:84%
and be prepared to meet
these avatars in the middle.

00:17:43.970 --> 00:17:47.400 align:middle line:84%
And so I love all these
images of particularly

00:17:47.400 --> 00:17:50.610 align:middle line:84%
the Tibetan images, the Buddhist
images of various avatars,

00:17:50.610 --> 00:17:52.100 align:middle line:90%
the Kalki avatar.

00:17:52.100 --> 00:17:54.240 align:middle line:84%
Every religious
tradition on the planet

00:17:54.240 --> 00:17:58.960 align:middle line:84%
speaks of avatars that will
be arriving at an end time.

00:17:58.960 --> 00:18:01.500 align:middle line:84%
They're about to get
really busy on Earth.

00:18:01.500 --> 00:18:02.900 align:middle line:10%
Let me just put it that way.

00:18:02.900 --> 00:18:06.225 align:middle line:10%
If the tea leaves that
people are reading

00:18:06.225 --> 00:18:09.390 align:middle line:10%
are pointing in this
direction, as things heat up

00:18:09.390 --> 00:18:13.870 align:middle line:10%
with holy wars, it's all aimed
at accelerating the chaos so

00:18:13.870 --> 00:18:17.470 align:middle line:10%
that the Christ or the
Messiah or the Mahdi

00:18:17.470 --> 00:18:22.300 align:middle line:10%
or some particular avatar will
descend and fix everything.

00:18:22.300 --> 00:18:24.450 align:middle line:84%
That's the prophecies of
Judaism, Christianity,

00:18:24.450 --> 00:18:25.250 align:middle line:90%
and Islam.

00:18:25.250 --> 00:18:28.022 align:middle line:84%
That's what's happening
right now in the Middle East.

00:18:28.022 --> 00:18:32.030 align:middle line:84%
That game is now being played
right before our very eyes.

00:18:32.030 --> 00:18:35.410 align:middle line:84%
Then you have the Silicon
Valley boys and girls.

00:18:35.410 --> 00:18:37.180 align:middle line:84%
They want to turn
us into robots.

00:18:37.180 --> 00:18:40.040 align:middle line:10%
That also plays into all
the end time prophecies.

00:18:40.040 --> 00:18:41.740 align:middle line:10%
There's never been
a time in history

00:18:41.740 --> 00:18:44.200 align:middle line:10%
where we have seen
this convergence

00:18:44.200 --> 00:18:46.670 align:middle line:10%
of prophecies manifesting.

00:18:46.670 --> 00:18:49.090 align:middle line:10%
We are living it right now.

00:18:49.090 --> 00:18:52.510 align:middle line:84%
And it has to do, in my opinion,
and my closing remarks here

00:18:52.510 --> 00:18:55.000 align:middle line:84%
will be about the
correspondence between what

00:18:55.000 --> 00:18:57.940 align:middle line:84%
we see in the Egyptian imagery
of the ark of the millions

00:18:57.940 --> 00:19:01.510 align:middle line:84%
of years and the Christian
imagery of Christ

00:19:01.510 --> 00:19:04.270 align:middle line:90%
ascending on his throne.

00:19:04.270 --> 00:19:08.650 align:middle line:10%
Christ ascended on a
cloud, is what we are told,

00:19:08.650 --> 00:19:10.730 align:middle line:10%
and he will return
upon that cloud.

00:19:10.730 --> 00:19:13.030 align:middle line:84%
And in the earliest
depictions, he

00:19:13.030 --> 00:19:17.570 align:middle line:84%
is portrayed sitting on a throne
with his feet on a footstool.

00:19:17.570 --> 00:19:19.370 align:middle line:90%
That's the Ark of the Covenant.

00:19:19.370 --> 00:19:23.530 align:middle line:84%
It's exactly the same throne
that the Ptolemaic King

00:19:23.530 --> 00:19:27.070 align:middle line:84%
is sitting on 300 years
before the time of Jesus.

00:19:27.070 --> 00:19:29.420 align:middle line:90%
So Jesus is on that same throne.

00:19:29.420 --> 00:19:33.910 align:middle line:10%
He's got this orb of light
behind him, the cloud.

00:19:33.910 --> 00:19:36.070 align:middle line:84%
It's filled with
concentric rings,

00:19:36.070 --> 00:19:40.670 align:middle line:84%
indicating a portal or a
vortex or sound or vibration.

00:19:40.670 --> 00:19:43.510 align:middle line:10%
And he's ascending to an
interdimensional realm referred

00:19:43.510 --> 00:19:46.040 align:middle line:10%
to as the Kingdom
of Heaven, which

00:19:46.040 --> 00:19:48.890 align:middle line:10%
he can face back into
physical manifestation from

00:19:48.890 --> 00:19:51.440 align:middle line:10%
as well at any time.

00:19:51.440 --> 00:19:53.480 align:middle line:84%
And the point of
Christianity is to learn

00:19:53.480 --> 00:19:57.090 align:middle line:84%
to rise to meet
him in this cloud.

00:19:57.090 --> 00:20:00.380 align:middle line:84%
Well, when I first started
looking at this in the early

00:20:00.380 --> 00:20:04.080 align:middle line:84%
2000s, I'm thinking, well, look
at the way this is portrayed.

00:20:04.080 --> 00:20:09.630 align:middle line:84%
It looks like the way we portray
a wormhole with transition zone.

00:20:09.630 --> 00:20:12.320 align:middle line:10%
Then you have a vortex
and then you have

00:20:12.320 --> 00:20:14.280 align:middle line:10%
the throat of the wormhole.

00:20:14.280 --> 00:20:17.400 align:middle line:10%
And it's perfectly
demarcated in this imagery.

00:20:17.400 --> 00:20:19.940 align:middle line:10%
And I just find that
utterly fascinating that we

00:20:19.940 --> 00:20:23.690 align:middle line:10%
can think of the cloud or
portal that Jesus travels in

00:20:23.690 --> 00:20:27.440 align:middle line:10%
as a wormhole, just like we
think of the ascending Ptolemaic

00:20:27.440 --> 00:20:30.230 align:middle line:10%
King is riding
around in a wormhole.

00:20:30.230 --> 00:20:33.740 align:middle line:10%
So as I look at this
imagery, I'm thinking,

00:20:33.740 --> 00:20:35.810 align:middle line:10%
what are we dealing
with here with

00:20:35.810 --> 00:20:37.910 align:middle line:10%
these interdimensional beings?

00:20:37.910 --> 00:20:40.400 align:middle line:84%
They're not traveling
in spaceships.

00:20:40.400 --> 00:20:44.753 align:middle line:84%
It's not a hardware
UFO type of a thing.

00:20:44.753 --> 00:20:49.650 align:middle line:84%
This is something more akin
to a wormhole or a warp craft,

00:20:49.650 --> 00:20:50.710 align:middle line:90%
something like that.

00:20:50.710 --> 00:20:53.570 align:middle line:84%
But it's, I believe, more
spiritual than technological

00:20:53.570 --> 00:20:54.370 align:middle line:90%
in nature.

00:20:54.370 --> 00:20:56.100 align:middle line:84%
I'm not saying Jesus
is flying around

00:20:56.100 --> 00:21:00.840 align:middle line:84%
in some wormhole that's made by
Raytheon or something like that.

00:21:00.840 --> 00:21:04.410 align:middle line:10%
That this is more of
an organic wormhole,

00:21:04.410 --> 00:21:07.740 align:middle line:10%
that he's manifested out of his
physical flesh and blood body,

00:21:07.740 --> 00:21:09.420 align:middle line:10%
just the way the
Tibetans tell us we

00:21:09.420 --> 00:21:12.870 align:middle line:10%
can do this with the
rainbow light body.

00:21:12.870 --> 00:21:15.420 align:middle line:10%
Ascension and
interstellar travel, these

00:21:15.420 --> 00:21:16.870 align:middle line:10%
are the goals of humanity.

00:21:16.870 --> 00:21:20.220 align:middle line:10%
And what stands in our way is
the speed of light and energy

00:21:20.220 --> 00:21:22.960 align:middle line:10%
requirements and the
fragility of the human body.

00:21:22.960 --> 00:21:28.480 align:middle line:84%
What if the ancients worked all
this out a long time ago for us?

00:21:28.480 --> 00:21:30.450 align:middle line:84%
That was the
supposition or premise

00:21:30.450 --> 00:21:35.100 align:middle line:84%
of my presentation Morph,
which I did back in 2008.

00:21:35.100 --> 00:21:39.000 align:middle line:10%
And in this presentation,
I was working

00:21:39.000 --> 00:21:43.380 align:middle line:10%
on research about the
Alcubierre warp bubble.

00:21:43.380 --> 00:21:46.270 align:middle line:84%
Miguel Alcubierre is
a Mexican physicist.

00:21:46.270 --> 00:21:49.980 align:middle line:84%
He's watching Star Trek
in 1994, and he comes up

00:21:49.980 --> 00:21:53.280 align:middle line:84%
with this idea of
a warp craft that

00:21:53.280 --> 00:21:57.040 align:middle line:84%
would be able to manifest
a magic bubble around it.

00:21:57.040 --> 00:22:00.820 align:middle line:10%
So if you think of this
laser pointer as the craft,

00:22:00.820 --> 00:22:04.280 align:middle line:10%
the craft would be enfolded
within this magic bubble.

00:22:04.280 --> 00:22:07.360 align:middle line:10%
And if it would
want to travel, say,

00:22:07.360 --> 00:22:10.150 align:middle line:10%
10 light years of
space time, that

00:22:10.150 --> 00:22:12.110 align:middle line:10%
would take a very long time.

00:22:12.110 --> 00:22:15.490 align:middle line:10%
But in Alcubierre's
warp bubble concept,

00:22:15.490 --> 00:22:18.580 align:middle line:10%
the craft would manifest
the warp bubble,

00:22:18.580 --> 00:22:21.590 align:middle line:10%
and it wouldn't
actually go anywhere.

00:22:21.590 --> 00:22:23.590 align:middle line:90%
It would remain stationary.

00:22:23.590 --> 00:22:27.730 align:middle line:84%
That way, it didn't violate
Einstein's speed of light.

00:22:27.730 --> 00:22:31.330 align:middle line:84%
And the occupants
of that warp craft

00:22:31.330 --> 00:22:34.470 align:middle line:84%
then would be able to travel
from Earth to another star

00:22:34.470 --> 00:22:35.270 align:middle line:90%
system.

00:22:35.270 --> 00:22:39.710 align:middle line:10%
And this is the way
Alcubierre imagined

00:22:39.710 --> 00:22:43.240 align:middle line:10%
this, is that the craft
would be inside this bubble.

00:22:43.240 --> 00:22:46.600 align:middle line:10%
And he goes into
this explanation

00:22:46.600 --> 00:22:50.905 align:middle line:10%
for how through a process of
expansion and contraction,

00:22:50.905 --> 00:22:55.510 align:middle line:10%
the warp bubble would actually
be able to enable the craft

00:22:55.510 --> 00:22:58.210 align:middle line:10%
to travel through space time.

00:22:58.210 --> 00:23:00.280 align:middle line:10%
Well, I'm looking at
the Alcubierre warp

00:23:00.280 --> 00:23:02.660 align:middle line:10%
bubble, the craft
inside the warp bubble,

00:23:02.660 --> 00:23:05.500 align:middle line:10%
looking at the Ascension images
of Jesus and I'm thinking,

00:23:05.500 --> 00:23:07.150 align:middle line:10%
there seems to be
a correspondence

00:23:07.150 --> 00:23:12.280 align:middle line:10%
here, that he's sitting
stationary on a throne

00:23:12.280 --> 00:23:15.640 align:middle line:10%
while he's traveling in a
bubble interdimensionally.

00:23:15.640 --> 00:23:18.930 align:middle line:10%
And that's exactly what
Alcubierre was describing.

00:23:18.930 --> 00:23:25.930 align:middle line:10%
Well, that sits with me
for a while until 2017.

00:23:25.930 --> 00:23:29.120 align:middle line:84%
That's about 10 years goes by as
I'm thinking about all of this

00:23:29.120 --> 00:23:31.490 align:middle line:84%
and wondering where it's
ultimately going to go.

00:23:31.490 --> 00:23:35.950 align:middle line:84%
And then in 2017, suddenly The
New York times publishes these

00:23:35.950 --> 00:23:40.310 align:middle line:84%
videos, the Tic Tac video and
the Gimbal and 'GoFast' videos.

00:23:40.310 --> 00:23:41.630 align:middle line:90%
You've probably seen them.

00:23:41.630 --> 00:23:48.640 align:middle line:90%


00:23:48.640 --> 00:23:51.220 align:middle line:84%
These are videos
taken by F-18 pilots

00:23:51.220 --> 00:23:54.540 align:middle line:84%
off the Coast of California
and Florida of USO.

00:23:54.540 --> 00:23:55.340 align:middle line:90%
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:23:55.340 --> 00:23:56.577 align:middle line:90%
- Whoa, got it!

00:23:56.577 --> 00:23:58.250 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHS] Woo hoo.

00:23:58.250 --> 00:23:59.050 align:middle line:90%
- Roger.

00:23:59.050 --> 00:24:00.746 align:middle line:90%
There's a shooting--

00:24:00.746 --> 00:24:03.180 align:middle line:90%
- [AUDIO OUT] Look at that, man.

00:24:03.180 --> 00:24:05.205 align:middle line:90%
Can you catch the moving target?

00:24:05.205 --> 00:24:06.990 align:middle line:90%
- No, I took an auto track.

00:24:06.990 --> 00:24:07.986 align:middle line:90%
- Oh, OK.

00:24:07.986 --> 00:24:10.080 align:middle line:90%
- Oh, my gosh, dude.

00:24:10.080 --> 00:24:10.895 align:middle line:90%
Wow.

00:24:10.895 --> 00:24:11.695 align:middle line:90%
- OK.

00:24:11.695 --> 00:24:12.720 align:middle line:90%
- Wow, man.

[END PLAYBACK]

00:24:16.280 --> 00:24:19.692 align:middle line:84%
So these are craft that
F-18 pilots are chasing.

00:24:19.692 --> 00:24:21.650 align:middle line:84%
They're obviously having
a good time with them.

00:24:21.650 --> 00:24:23.830 align:middle line:90%
Woo hoo, this kind of thing.

00:24:23.830 --> 00:24:25.460 align:middle line:84%
But these craft
could go from, say,

00:24:25.460 --> 00:24:28.140 align:middle line:84%
80,000 down to the surface
of the ocean in the blink

00:24:28.140 --> 00:24:28.940 align:middle line:90%
of an eye.

00:24:28.940 --> 00:24:33.030 align:middle line:84%
They can travel vast distances
and also a blink of an eye.

00:24:33.030 --> 00:24:36.050 align:middle line:84%
And we're wondering, well,
what are these craft?

00:24:36.050 --> 00:24:38.430 align:middle line:84%
And how are they
able to do this?

00:24:38.430 --> 00:24:41.600 align:middle line:84%
Well, then my friend, Dr.
Travis Taylor, comes along

00:24:41.600 --> 00:24:44.550 align:middle line:10%
and he took a look at another of
these videos, the Gimbal video.

00:24:44.550 --> 00:24:47.610 align:middle line:10%
I've got actually the
Tic Tac video up here.

00:24:47.610 --> 00:24:49.790 align:middle line:10%
But he was studying
the Gimbal video.

00:24:49.790 --> 00:24:54.470 align:middle line:10%
And he commented on this,
saying that the 'GoFast' video

00:24:54.470 --> 00:24:58.340 align:middle line:10%
and the Tic Tac show a halo
around these craft that is very,

00:24:58.340 --> 00:25:01.860 align:middle line:10%
very cold inside, this sphere
that is around the craft,

00:25:01.860 --> 00:25:03.410 align:middle line:10%
while the craft is hotter.

00:25:03.410 --> 00:25:06.057 align:middle line:10%
The ambient cloud layer
around it is much warmer.

00:25:06.057 --> 00:25:07.640 align:middle line:10%
And for some reason,
there seems to be

00:25:07.640 --> 00:25:11.060 align:middle line:10%
this bubble around the vehicle
that looks like a vacuum,

00:25:11.060 --> 00:25:14.990 align:middle line:10%
or at least much colder than
normal atmosphere in the region.

00:25:14.990 --> 00:25:17.850 align:middle line:10%
Now remember, Dr. Travis
Taylor is the chief scientist

00:25:17.850 --> 00:25:19.840 align:middle line:10%
of the US Government's
UAP program.

00:25:19.840 --> 00:25:24.340 align:middle line:10%
This is just the public analysis
that he's giving of this video.

00:25:24.340 --> 00:25:28.390 align:middle line:10%
Everything behind it
is still classified.

00:25:28.390 --> 00:25:30.360 align:middle line:10%
But what he goes
on to say is, is

00:25:30.360 --> 00:25:33.790 align:middle line:10%
that he can't explain
what he is seeing here.

00:25:33.790 --> 00:25:35.730 align:middle line:10%
But if you look at
exotic solutions

00:25:35.730 --> 00:25:39.330 align:middle line:10%
like warp bubbles, wormholes,
general relativistic,

00:25:39.330 --> 00:25:42.360 align:middle line:10%
anti-gravity type
concepts, all these things

00:25:42.360 --> 00:25:45.030 align:middle line:10%
require some kind of
magic bubble of space time

00:25:45.030 --> 00:25:46.690 align:middle line:10%
manipulation around it.

00:25:46.690 --> 00:25:48.270 align:middle line:10%
And this could be
the telltale sign

00:25:48.270 --> 00:25:51.640 align:middle line:10%
that this is what we are
seeing in these videos.

00:25:51.640 --> 00:25:54.210 align:middle line:10%
So when Travis comes
out with this analysis,

00:25:54.210 --> 00:25:56.880 align:middle line:10%
it suddenly blew all
the doors and windows

00:25:56.880 --> 00:26:00.150 align:middle line:10%
open in my imagination
because, again, I

00:26:00.150 --> 00:26:04.110 align:middle line:10%
had spent the past 15 years
looking at the Alcubierre warp

00:26:04.110 --> 00:26:06.390 align:middle line:10%
bubble and comparing
it with what

00:26:06.390 --> 00:26:10.540 align:middle line:10%
we see in Christian art and
Tibetan art and elsewhere.

00:26:10.540 --> 00:26:14.310 align:middle line:84%
And they're all describing
exactly the same thing.

00:26:14.310 --> 00:26:19.320 align:middle line:84%
Interdimensional travel or
advanced travel mechanisms

00:26:19.320 --> 00:26:23.800 align:middle line:84%
through the manifestation of
some kind of a bubble around us.

00:26:23.800 --> 00:26:26.860 align:middle line:84%
And that is what the
rainbow light body is too.

00:26:26.860 --> 00:26:32.370 align:middle line:84%
It's a magic bubble that opens
or is awakened from within us

00:26:32.370 --> 00:26:35.670 align:middle line:84%
that enables us to travel
to various star systems

00:26:35.670 --> 00:26:38.520 align:middle line:84%
according to the
Tibetan tradition.

00:26:38.520 --> 00:26:42.150 align:middle line:84%
So I started to really be
enthused by this thinking,

00:26:42.150 --> 00:26:45.780 align:middle line:84%
well, wait a minute,
what exactly is going

00:26:45.780 --> 00:26:47.860 align:middle line:90%
on with some of these videos?

00:26:47.860 --> 00:26:50.610 align:middle line:10%
There's been analysis that
even says that these videos--

00:26:50.610 --> 00:26:53.040 align:middle line:10%
excuse me, these craft
that we see in these videos

00:26:53.040 --> 00:26:56.890 align:middle line:10%
don't actually exist
in our 3D reality.

00:26:56.890 --> 00:27:00.160 align:middle line:84%
They are projections
from another reality.

00:27:00.160 --> 00:27:02.550 align:middle line:84%
Those F-18 pilots
couldn't actually

00:27:02.550 --> 00:27:05.070 align:middle line:84%
crash into one of these
craft because they don't

00:27:05.070 --> 00:27:07.480 align:middle line:90%
have a physical existence.

00:27:07.480 --> 00:27:09.690 align:middle line:10%
Well, that's exactly
what is described

00:27:09.690 --> 00:27:14.590 align:middle line:10%
in the warp bubble called the
cloud that Jesus travels within.

00:27:14.590 --> 00:27:16.980 align:middle line:84%
It's an interdimensional
craft of some kind

00:27:16.980 --> 00:27:19.090 align:middle line:90%
that isn't literally physical.

00:27:19.090 --> 00:27:20.850 align:middle line:10%
Remember, when Mary
Magdalene first

00:27:20.850 --> 00:27:23.080 align:middle line:10%
sees the resurrected
Jesus on Easter morning,

00:27:23.080 --> 00:27:26.410 align:middle line:10%
he says, don't touch me,
because he can't be touched.

00:27:26.410 --> 00:27:28.690 align:middle line:10%
He's not in a physical
flesh and blood form.

00:27:28.690 --> 00:27:32.190 align:middle line:10%
He can be seen, probably could
even have been photographed,

00:27:32.190 --> 00:27:36.380 align:middle line:10%
but could not actually have been
physically touched by a human

00:27:36.380 --> 00:27:37.180 align:middle line:10%
being.

00:27:37.180 --> 00:27:39.030 align:middle line:10%
It's the same kind of concept.

00:27:39.030 --> 00:27:43.380 align:middle line:10%
And this is what I'm thinking
is going on right now with some

00:27:43.380 --> 00:27:47.040 align:middle line:10%
of these videos that there's
possibly a spiritual component

00:27:47.040 --> 00:27:50.790 align:middle line:10%
to it, a component
that was certainly

00:27:50.790 --> 00:27:53.500 align:middle line:10%
known in the ancient world
by the ancient Egyptians.

00:27:53.500 --> 00:27:55.030 align:middle line:84%
They didn't call
it a warp bubble.

00:27:55.030 --> 00:27:57.240 align:middle line:84%
They called it the ark
of the millions of years

00:27:57.240 --> 00:27:58.840 align:middle line:90%
or the ship of eternity.

00:27:58.840 --> 00:28:00.687 align:middle line:10%
And the reason why,
once again, the Pharaoh

00:28:00.687 --> 00:28:02.520 align:middle line:10%
is sitting on the
feathered ascension throne

00:28:02.520 --> 00:28:04.650 align:middle line:10%
is because it's some kind
of what we would term

00:28:04.650 --> 00:28:08.940 align:middle line:10%
an anti-gravity device that
keeps his body, of his flesh

00:28:08.940 --> 00:28:10.860 align:middle line:10%
and blood from
being ripped apart

00:28:10.860 --> 00:28:13.680 align:middle line:10%
by the gravitational
forces as he's traveling

00:28:13.680 --> 00:28:15.270 align:middle line:10%
through these wormholes.

00:28:15.270 --> 00:28:18.330 align:middle line:84%
But again, I've been suggesting
that he's not actually

00:28:18.330 --> 00:28:20.320 align:middle line:84%
in a physical flesh
and blood form.

00:28:20.320 --> 00:28:22.030 align:middle line:90%
He's in a light body form.

00:28:22.030 --> 00:28:25.900 align:middle line:84%
And this is how he's able
to travel upon the wormhole.

00:28:25.900 --> 00:28:28.920 align:middle line:10%
But I'm of the opinion
and it's been now

00:28:28.920 --> 00:28:33.990 align:middle line:10%
been upheld in many ways by some
of the researchers in the UAP

00:28:33.990 --> 00:28:37.320 align:middle line:10%
field that we are talking
about the same thing here.

00:28:37.320 --> 00:28:41.070 align:middle line:10%
That what the ancients were
seeing when they're portraying,

00:28:41.070 --> 00:28:45.210 align:middle line:10%
figures such as the Ptolemies
here on their wormhole craft,

00:28:45.210 --> 00:28:49.620 align:middle line:10%
is the same thing that the
Defense Intelligence agencies

00:28:49.620 --> 00:28:51.930 align:middle line:10%
have been exploring
in terms of warp

00:28:51.930 --> 00:28:55.690 align:middle line:10%
drives, anti-gravity
wormholes, ancient technology.

00:28:55.690 --> 00:29:00.240 align:middle line:10%
This is what we are doing is
now revisiting or re-learning

00:29:00.240 --> 00:29:05.080 align:middle line:10%
exactly what the ancients had
already discovered long ago.

00:29:05.080 --> 00:29:09.000 align:middle line:84%
And in my view, once again, when
we look at images such as this,

00:29:09.000 --> 00:29:12.600 align:middle line:84%
here's a good example of
a Pharaoh on his ascension

00:29:12.600 --> 00:29:14.700 align:middle line:84%
throne with his
resurrection stick,

00:29:14.700 --> 00:29:17.920 align:middle line:84%
with his key of
life in a bubble.

00:29:17.920 --> 00:29:21.400 align:middle line:10%
What if this is the magic
bubble that Alcubierre

00:29:21.400 --> 00:29:22.557 align:middle line:10%
is talking about?

00:29:22.557 --> 00:29:24.890 align:middle line:10%
What we're seeing-- this is
actually a piece of jewelry.

00:29:24.890 --> 00:29:31.560 align:middle line:84%
It's a petrol, where we see
the boat traveling upon water.

00:29:31.560 --> 00:29:34.630 align:middle line:10%
Above it is a bar
filled with stars.

00:29:34.630 --> 00:29:39.390 align:middle line:84%
And so this is a boat-- a magic
bubble on a wormhole-shaped boat

00:29:39.390 --> 00:29:41.320 align:middle line:90%
traveling through the stars.

00:29:41.320 --> 00:29:44.470 align:middle line:84%
And on either side
is the goddess Isis,

00:29:44.470 --> 00:29:47.440 align:middle line:84%
and on the other side
is her sister Nephthys.

00:29:47.440 --> 00:29:51.490 align:middle line:84%
These two symbolize
light and dark.

00:29:51.490 --> 00:29:54.720 align:middle line:10%
Now, think about what
that means in light

00:29:54.720 --> 00:29:56.540 align:middle line:10%
of what Alcubierre was saying.

00:29:56.540 --> 00:29:58.740 align:middle line:10%
He said the Alcubierre
drive achieves faster

00:29:58.740 --> 00:30:01.230 align:middle line:10%
than light travel by stretching
the fabric of spacetime

00:30:01.230 --> 00:30:03.450 align:middle line:10%
in a wave, causing
the space ahead of it

00:30:03.450 --> 00:30:07.200 align:middle line:10%
to contract while the
space behind it expands.

00:30:07.200 --> 00:30:09.450 align:middle line:10%
And then, he says, in
theory, a spacecraft

00:30:09.450 --> 00:30:12.210 align:middle line:10%
inside this wave
or the bubble would

00:30:12.210 --> 00:30:15.090 align:middle line:10%
be able to ride this warp
bubble and achieve velocities

00:30:15.090 --> 00:30:16.520 align:middle line:10%
beyond the speed of light.

00:30:16.520 --> 00:30:18.930 align:middle line:10%
This is the Alcubierre
warp metric.

00:30:18.930 --> 00:30:21.430 align:middle line:10%
And that's exactly
what is portrayed here.

00:30:21.430 --> 00:30:23.350 align:middle line:10%
The magic bubble
is clearly evident.

00:30:23.350 --> 00:30:25.830 align:middle line:10%
The goddesses, Isis and
Nephthys flanking it

00:30:25.830 --> 00:30:29.270 align:middle line:10%
symbolized light and dark or
expansion and contraction.

00:30:29.270 --> 00:30:33.220 align:middle line:10%
This is just either a fun way
of interpreting ancient art,

00:30:33.220 --> 00:30:37.330 align:middle line:10%
or it's pictorial evidence that
the ancients had some awareness

00:30:37.330 --> 00:30:40.040 align:middle line:10%
or knowledge of wormholes.

00:30:40.040 --> 00:30:43.720 align:middle line:10%
This is an actual image
of a real-world warp

00:30:43.720 --> 00:30:46.420 align:middle line:10%
bubble from Dr.
Harold G. Sonny White

00:30:46.420 --> 00:30:48.880 align:middle line:10%
down at Johnson Space
Center, where we

00:30:48.880 --> 00:30:50.470 align:middle line:10%
see the bubble in the middle.

00:30:50.470 --> 00:30:53.440 align:middle line:10%
On either side, we see the
expansion and contraction.

00:30:53.440 --> 00:30:55.790 align:middle line:84%
Superimposed that over
the Egyptian imagery.

00:30:55.790 --> 00:30:57.020 align:middle line:90%
It's a perfect fit.

00:30:57.020 --> 00:30:58.780 align:middle line:10%
And I think what I'm
going to leave you

00:30:58.780 --> 00:31:00.613 align:middle line:10%
with here, because we're
getting ready to do

00:31:00.613 --> 00:31:03.610 align:middle line:10%
the meditation, my talk
has been cut short,

00:31:03.610 --> 00:31:08.590 align:middle line:10%
is that in order to
understand what is transpiring

00:31:08.590 --> 00:31:12.740 align:middle line:10%
in our modern world, we have
to go back to the ancient mind,

00:31:12.740 --> 00:31:15.740 align:middle line:10%
and we have to
understand possibility

00:31:15.740 --> 00:31:18.650 align:middle line:10%
that there are ancient
civilizations that

00:31:18.650 --> 00:31:19.890 align:middle line:10%
have been coming and going.

00:31:19.890 --> 00:31:21.740 align:middle line:10%
And now we're taking
videos of them.

00:31:21.740 --> 00:31:24.510 align:middle line:84%
And ultimately, the message
is going to be about,

00:31:24.510 --> 00:31:27.340 align:middle line:90%
how do we transfigure?

00:31:27.340 --> 00:31:29.960 align:middle line:10%
How do we raise ourselves
in our vibration

00:31:29.960 --> 00:31:34.050 align:middle line:10%
to be able to rise up and
meet them where they are?

00:31:34.050 --> 00:31:38.270 align:middle line:84%
So thank you, everybody, so much
for your attention this morning.

00:31:38.270 --> 00:31:39.440 align:middle line:90%
It's been very glorious.
