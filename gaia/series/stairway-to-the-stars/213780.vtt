00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:14.370 align:middle line:10%
>> Now it's going
to get really fun.

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:17.440 align:middle line:10%
So I did this TV show
called "America Unearthed,"

00:00:17.440 --> 00:00:21.590 align:middle line:10%
and we did four
seasons, 49 episodes.

00:00:21.590 --> 00:00:22.580 align:middle line:90%
It was fantastic.

00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:25.900 align:middle line:84%
We had a lot of fun,
and I feel like we've

00:00:25.900 --> 00:00:28.060 align:middle line:84%
told all the things
that we really

00:00:28.060 --> 00:00:32.460 align:middle line:90%
wanted to tell in that way.

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:36.740 align:middle line:84%
But because of that,
I was contacted by,

00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:39.210 align:middle line:84%
I mean, thousands and
thousands of emails.

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:42.510 align:middle line:84%
Most of the stuff is
crazy, but not crazy.

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:46.560 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, a lot of it's crazy,
but some of it's really good.

00:00:46.560 --> 00:00:49.260 align:middle line:84%
One of the things that happened
is I was approached by a guy

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:50.760 align:middle line:84%
by the name of Don
Ruh that you're

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:53.703 align:middle line:90%
going to meet in a second.

00:00:53.703 --> 00:00:55.620 align:middle line:84%
And then you're going
to meet his best friend.

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:57.620 align:middle line:90%
His name is Bill Jackson.

00:00:57.620 --> 00:00:59.430 align:middle line:84%
And these guys
were best friends.

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:00.570 align:middle line:90%
They lived in New York.

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:02.840 align:middle line:84%
They lived in the Bronx
when they were younger.

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:04.440 align:middle line:90%
And Don is still alive.

00:01:04.440 --> 00:01:05.750 align:middle line:90%
He's 80 years old.

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:09.170 align:middle line:84%
In fact, he and I have
written two books I'm

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:10.620 align:middle line:90%
going to talk about at the end.

00:01:10.620 --> 00:01:16.060 align:middle line:84%
But his buddy, Bill, in
1971, purchased something

00:01:16.060 --> 00:01:18.070 align:middle line:90%
called the Cremona Document.

00:01:18.070 --> 00:01:22.840 align:middle line:84%
And we didn't know what it
was until fairly recently.

00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:25.400 align:middle line:90%
But this is really cool.

00:01:25.400 --> 00:01:28.960 align:middle line:84%
It's a 12th-century Templar
document that has been upgraded

00:01:28.960 --> 00:01:31.400 align:middle line:84%
multiple times
over the centuries.

00:01:31.400 --> 00:01:35.110 align:middle line:84%
Now, the way this story
started is Bill and Don

00:01:35.110 --> 00:01:39.600 align:middle line:84%
and some other guys used to
go scuba diving off Bannerman

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:42.610 align:middle line:84%
Island, which is in the
middle of the Hudson River,

00:01:42.610 --> 00:01:45.090 align:middle line:84%
about an hour North
of New York City.

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:49.290 align:middle line:84%
And what happened was
Bannerman was an arms dealer.

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:51.750 align:middle line:84%
And during the
Civil War, he would

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:53.410 align:middle line:84%
sell to both the
North and the South.

00:01:53.410 --> 00:01:55.420 align:middle line:84%
And then his son took
over the business,

00:01:55.420 --> 00:01:58.890 align:middle line:84%
and he actually got in
trouble selling weapons

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:01.330 align:middle line:84%
to different parties
during World War I.

00:02:01.330 --> 00:02:06.100 align:middle line:84%
And in the early part
of 1918, he died.

00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:07.960 align:middle line:90%
His sons argued over the estate.

00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:11.520 align:middle line:84%
The estate fell into disrepair
and then basically into ruins.

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:15.630 align:middle line:84%
In 1958, the munitions that
were stored on the island right

00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:20.040 align:middle line:84%
here by the castle exploded
and sent all this stuff

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:20.950 align:middle line:90%
into the river.

00:02:20.950 --> 00:02:23.460 align:middle line:84%
Those guys were scuba
diving in the river looking

00:02:23.460 --> 00:02:25.680 align:middle line:84%
for the munitions so they
could take it into the city

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:28.181 align:middle line:90%
and sell it and get money.

00:02:28.181 --> 00:02:31.020 align:middle line:84%
Well, one of the things
that happened is Don--

00:02:31.020 --> 00:02:32.790 align:middle line:84%
now, this is a
drone shot I took.

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:34.860 align:middle line:10%
But right about here,
only a quarter mile

00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:38.340 align:middle line:10%
away from the island
would be the eastern shore

00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:39.870 align:middle line:10%
of the Hudson River.

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:44.470 align:middle line:84%
And Don was snorkeling
along there, and he found--

00:02:44.470 --> 00:02:45.360 align:middle line:90%
oh, there's Don.

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:46.705 align:middle line:90%
[CHUCKLES]

00:02:46.705 --> 00:02:48.550 align:middle line:84%
This is a year
ago this fall when

00:02:48.550 --> 00:02:51.490 align:middle line:84%
we were in the woods,
when Janet and I and Don

00:02:51.490 --> 00:02:56.040 align:middle line:84%
went looking for a treasure in
the documents, and we found it.

00:02:56.040 --> 00:02:58.200 align:middle line:90%
But we haven't told anybody yet.

00:02:58.200 --> 00:03:00.070 align:middle line:90%
It'll happen.

00:03:00.070 --> 00:03:02.980 align:middle line:84%
So after we got done,
we took some pictures.

00:03:02.980 --> 00:03:06.860 align:middle line:84%
And I'll come back, but
remember these smiling faces.

00:03:06.860 --> 00:03:11.110 align:middle line:84%
So Don is snorkeling
along the eastern side,

00:03:11.110 --> 00:03:13.360 align:middle line:84%
and he finds this
decorative ornament

00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:16.150 align:middle line:84%
that got blown off the island
from the flower gardens

00:03:16.150 --> 00:03:18.610 align:middle line:84%
because Mrs. Bannerman
was a florist.

00:03:18.610 --> 00:03:20.680 align:middle line:84%
And she had these
beautiful flower gardens,

00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:23.410 align:middle line:84%
and these were decorative
ornaments that got blown off

00:03:23.410 --> 00:03:25.850 align:middle line:90%
the island when it exploded.

00:03:25.850 --> 00:03:32.520 align:middle line:84%
And Bill, his buddy, his wife,
Miriam, was also a gardener.

00:03:32.520 --> 00:03:34.650 align:middle line:84%
So he gave both of the--
he found two of them.

00:03:34.650 --> 00:03:36.710 align:middle line:90%
He gave them both to Miriam--

00:03:36.710 --> 00:03:39.440 align:middle line:84%
Muriel, and she put 'em
in her flower garden.

00:03:39.440 --> 00:03:43.707 align:middle line:84%
A year later, in 1969,
his five-year-old son Mark

00:03:43.707 --> 00:03:44.790 align:middle line:90%
was playing in the garden.

00:03:44.790 --> 00:03:47.670 align:middle line:84%
And he grabbed that round ball
on the top, and he broke it.

00:03:47.670 --> 00:03:50.000 align:middle line:10%
It fell to the ground, and
they realized that there

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:53.110 align:middle line:10%
was stuff inside of it.

00:03:53.110 --> 00:03:56.120 align:middle line:10%
Now, that's Don when we
interviewed him last year,

00:03:56.120 --> 00:03:59.260 align:middle line:10%
standing on the island,
standing about on the spot

00:03:59.260 --> 00:04:02.550 align:middle line:10%
where he found one
of those ornaments.

00:04:02.550 --> 00:04:07.570 align:middle line:84%
Inside this ornament
was a brass disk.

00:04:07.570 --> 00:04:09.350 align:middle line:84%
It's actually a
navigation device.

00:04:09.350 --> 00:04:12.120 align:middle line:84%
It's almost exactly the
size of a hockey puck.

00:04:12.120 --> 00:04:15.990 align:middle line:84%
And when you open it up,
there were four metal inserts

00:04:15.990 --> 00:04:17.140 align:middle line:90%
inside of it.

00:04:17.140 --> 00:04:22.230 align:middle line:84%
The other thing that they found
was a 4-inch long clay tube that

00:04:22.230 --> 00:04:24.520 align:middle line:84%
was sealed with
beeswax on either end.

00:04:24.520 --> 00:04:27.330 align:middle line:84%
And inside, there
were two parchments.

00:04:27.330 --> 00:04:31.320 align:middle line:84%
And on the parchments
were these Theban symbols.

00:04:31.320 --> 00:04:34.530 align:middle line:84%
Now, I'll come back and tell
you a little more about Theban,

00:04:34.530 --> 00:04:36.730 align:middle line:84%
but Theban was used
by the Templars.

00:04:36.730 --> 00:04:38.970 align:middle line:84%
It's a one-to-one
letter substitution.

00:04:38.970 --> 00:04:42.740 align:middle line:84%
Do you see all the little
Ms in all the characters?

00:04:42.740 --> 00:04:45.000 align:middle line:90%
That's for Mary, the goddess.

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:47.040 align:middle line:90%
That was their alphabet.

00:04:47.040 --> 00:04:49.940 align:middle line:84%
In any case, I'll
come back to this.

00:04:49.940 --> 00:04:52.895 align:middle line:90%
Just hold that thought.

00:04:52.895 --> 00:04:55.760 align:middle line:90%
Here's Bill, Bill Jackson.

00:04:55.760 --> 00:04:58.750 align:middle line:84%
He worked for a private
security company--

00:04:58.750 --> 00:05:00.710 align:middle line:84%
that's what I'm
supposed to say--

00:05:00.710 --> 00:05:04.080 align:middle line:90%
[CHUCKLES] from '62 to '94.

00:05:04.080 --> 00:05:05.490 align:middle line:90%
He served in the Korean War.

00:05:05.490 --> 00:05:07.950 align:middle line:84%
And when he got out,
he needed a job.

00:05:07.950 --> 00:05:11.340 align:middle line:10%
Don had already-- they
started the company in 1961.

00:05:11.340 --> 00:05:12.830 align:middle line:90%
He said, I'll get you a job.

00:05:12.830 --> 00:05:15.950 align:middle line:84%
And so that's when
he joined in '62.

00:05:15.950 --> 00:05:20.480 align:middle line:84%
In 1971, because
of that brass disk

00:05:20.480 --> 00:05:23.480 align:middle line:84%
and the things that were
etched on these metal inserts,

00:05:23.480 --> 00:05:27.080 align:middle line:84%
led him to go to Rome, where
he purchased this document

00:05:27.080 --> 00:05:31.165 align:middle line:84%
from a very prominent Italian
family, the Benvenuto Family.

00:05:31.165 --> 00:05:33.770 align:middle line:90%


00:05:33.770 --> 00:05:37.940 align:middle line:84%
It contains encrypted
messages and treasure maps

00:05:37.940 --> 00:05:41.725 align:middle line:84%
and all kinds of stuff of the
Templars, of the Templar order.

00:05:41.725 --> 00:05:44.250 align:middle line:90%


00:05:44.250 --> 00:05:46.630 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to talk a little
bit about the treasures.

00:05:46.630 --> 00:05:51.530 align:middle line:84%
There's a firsthand narrative in
these documents that had to be--

00:05:51.530 --> 00:05:53.970 align:middle line:84%
it was encrypted and
had to be decoded,

00:05:53.970 --> 00:05:56.960 align:middle line:84%
but it talks about the
Templars going under the South

00:05:56.960 --> 00:05:58.910 align:middle line:90%
Wall of the Temple Mount.

00:05:58.910 --> 00:06:00.900 align:middle line:84%
And it talks about
what they found,

00:06:00.900 --> 00:06:04.140 align:middle line:90%
and I'll get to that in a sec.

00:06:04.140 --> 00:06:10.230 align:middle line:84%
What they found led them to
take a trip to North America

00:06:10.230 --> 00:06:15.840 align:middle line:84%
to recover scrolls that had been
hidden prior to that, sometime

00:06:15.840 --> 00:06:20.010 align:middle line:90%
before the year 1000.

00:06:20.010 --> 00:06:23.310 align:middle line:84%
During that journey,
six ships came over.

00:06:23.310 --> 00:06:26.780 align:middle line:84%
They lost one
rounding Newfoundland.

00:06:26.780 --> 00:06:30.750 align:middle line:84%
Bill, when he got it
deciphered, knew about this.

00:06:30.750 --> 00:06:33.840 align:middle line:84%
And he said, hey, Don,
I want to take a trip.

00:06:33.840 --> 00:06:34.965 align:middle line:90%
I want you to come with me.

00:06:34.965 --> 00:06:36.632 align:middle line:84%
We're going to go to
Newfoundland and go

00:06:36.632 --> 00:06:37.440 align:middle line:90%
scuba diving.

00:06:37.440 --> 00:06:41.730 align:middle line:84%
And Don says he said the
magic words, "I'll pay."

00:06:41.730 --> 00:06:45.990 align:middle line:84%
[CHUCKLES] So they went,
and they found that ship.

00:06:45.990 --> 00:06:48.970 align:middle line:84%
That convinced Bill
that the story was true,

00:06:48.970 --> 00:06:51.400 align:middle line:90%
and it went on from there.

00:06:51.400 --> 00:06:54.290 align:middle line:84%
Later on, they went up to
the Temple of the Goddess,

00:06:54.290 --> 00:06:57.280 align:middle line:84%
which is where the scrolls
were hidden, that a Templar

00:06:57.280 --> 00:07:01.250 align:middle line:84%
knight, by the name of Sir Ralph
de Sudeley, led this mission.

00:07:01.250 --> 00:07:06.290 align:middle line:10%
And their navigator was a
woman by the name of Altomara,

00:07:06.290 --> 00:07:09.740 align:middle line:10%
and she was killed during a
skirmish between two warring

00:07:09.740 --> 00:07:13.200 align:middle line:10%
tribes back in probably 1179.

00:07:13.200 --> 00:07:15.840 align:middle line:84%
Her body was burned, put
inside of a small box,

00:07:15.840 --> 00:07:17.970 align:middle line:84%
and then it was put
in a small cave.

00:07:17.970 --> 00:07:21.740 align:middle line:10%
And in 1977, they found
that cave and the urn

00:07:21.740 --> 00:07:24.440 align:middle line:10%
with her ashes and
the offerings that

00:07:24.440 --> 00:07:27.910 align:middle line:10%
were filled inside the cave.

00:07:27.910 --> 00:07:32.590 align:middle line:10%
In 1994, Bill was
a medical doctor.

00:07:32.590 --> 00:07:37.270 align:middle line:10%
And in 1994, he realized he was
dying from arteriosclerosis,

00:07:37.270 --> 00:07:39.500 align:middle line:10%
and he had Parkinson's disease.

00:07:39.500 --> 00:07:43.630 align:middle line:84%
So he sold the document
to the Vatican.

00:07:43.630 --> 00:07:45.300 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:07:45.300 --> 00:07:48.400 align:middle line:84%
Nobody's more disappointed
than me when I found that out.

00:07:48.400 --> 00:07:49.860 align:middle line:90%
What are you doing?

00:07:49.860 --> 00:07:51.250 align:middle line:90%
But all is not lost.

00:07:51.250 --> 00:07:52.860 align:middle line:90%
Hold that.

00:07:52.860 --> 00:07:57.900 align:middle line:84%
Here's Don and I when we
filmed "America Unearthed"

00:07:57.900 --> 00:08:01.150 align:middle line:84%
episode at the tower
a few years ago.

00:08:01.150 --> 00:08:06.730 align:middle line:84%
Don's 6 foot 8, and
I'm not that tall.

00:08:06.730 --> 00:08:07.530 align:middle line:90%
I'm 6' 2".

00:08:07.530 --> 00:08:08.870 align:middle line:90%
He's bigger.

00:08:08.870 --> 00:08:11.360 align:middle line:84%
He worked for the same
company, but he was one

00:08:11.360 --> 00:08:13.800 align:middle line:90%
of the founders of the company.

00:08:13.800 --> 00:08:15.190 align:middle line:90%
He and Bill were best friends.

00:08:15.190 --> 00:08:16.810 align:middle line:90%
They met when Don was seven.

00:08:16.810 --> 00:08:19.200 align:middle line:90%
Bill was 11.

00:08:19.200 --> 00:08:21.150 align:middle line:84%
Don never married,
so he was always

00:08:21.150 --> 00:08:24.100 align:middle line:84%
available to go on these
excursions with Bill.

00:08:24.100 --> 00:08:25.000 align:middle line:90%
You can't say no.

00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:28.280 align:middle line:90%
You got nothing going.

00:08:28.280 --> 00:08:30.720 align:middle line:84%
And he was there when
they discovered the ship.

00:08:30.720 --> 00:08:33.860 align:middle line:84%
And we've got his notebook,
and you won't believe the notes

00:08:33.860 --> 00:08:38.010 align:middle line:84%
that he took, the copious
notes, the detail, the sketches.

00:08:38.010 --> 00:08:39.000 align:middle line:90%
It's unbelievable.

00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:43.110 align:middle line:84%
He found a 12th-century
Templar ship.

00:08:43.110 --> 00:08:44.135 align:middle line:90%
It's still there.

00:08:44.135 --> 00:08:46.650 align:middle line:90%


00:08:46.650 --> 00:08:48.990 align:middle line:84%
He was there when they
discovered Altomara's tomb

00:08:48.990 --> 00:08:51.780 align:middle line:90%
in 1977.

00:08:51.780 --> 00:08:55.230 align:middle line:84%
And in 2004-- remember
Mark, the little boy

00:08:55.230 --> 00:08:57.750 align:middle line:90%
that broke the ornament?

00:08:57.750 --> 00:09:00.720 align:middle line:84%
He signed an agreement
with Don, turning over

00:09:00.720 --> 00:09:03.600 align:middle line:84%
all of his father's
research, everything to him,

00:09:03.600 --> 00:09:08.090 align:middle line:84%
and the rights to
use it in 2004.

00:09:08.090 --> 00:09:09.540 align:middle line:84%
And then a couple
of years later,

00:09:09.540 --> 00:09:11.400 align:middle line:90%
that's when Don contacted us.

00:09:11.400 --> 00:09:14.010 align:middle line:84%
And we've been working
with them ever since.

00:09:14.010 --> 00:09:21.220 align:middle line:84%
But the critical items
showed up, starting in 2017.

00:09:21.220 --> 00:09:27.550 align:middle line:84%
In the end, what we realized
was that Bill sold the document

00:09:27.550 --> 00:09:29.222 align:middle line:90%
to the Vatican.

00:09:29.222 --> 00:09:33.260 align:middle line:84%
But he pulled out the most
important parts and the maps.

00:09:33.260 --> 00:09:36.340 align:middle line:90%
And I mean, you'll see.

00:09:36.340 --> 00:09:40.030 align:middle line:84%
And he gave it to his
buddies in the agency.

00:09:40.030 --> 00:09:45.440 align:middle line:84%
Now, these guys used to
do really secret stuff

00:09:45.440 --> 00:09:46.710 align:middle line:90%
for our military.

00:09:46.710 --> 00:09:48.410 align:middle line:84%
They were hired
by-- their bosses

00:09:48.410 --> 00:09:50.300 align:middle line:84%
were military
generals that would

00:09:50.300 --> 00:09:52.170 align:middle line:90%
have them do certain things.

00:09:52.170 --> 00:09:56.180 align:middle line:84%
And as far as I'm concerned,
these guys are heroes.

00:09:56.180 --> 00:09:57.990 align:middle line:90%
They did this work.

00:09:57.990 --> 00:10:02.270 align:middle line:84%
Don's been shot twice,
knowing that they would never

00:10:02.270 --> 00:10:04.400 align:middle line:84%
be acknowledged, the
world would never know.

00:10:04.400 --> 00:10:06.440 align:middle line:90%
They'd just got paid.

00:10:06.440 --> 00:10:09.360 align:middle line:90%
But he's awful modest about it.

00:10:09.360 --> 00:10:11.990 align:middle line:84%
But what happened
was he disseminated

00:10:11.990 --> 00:10:14.300 align:middle line:84%
these important parts
to his colleagues

00:10:14.300 --> 00:10:17.930 align:middle line:84%
in the agency with strict
instructions upon their deaths

00:10:17.930 --> 00:10:21.660 align:middle line:84%
that this material
would go to Don Ruh.

00:10:21.660 --> 00:10:25.740 align:middle line:84%
And in the last six years,
five of them have died.

00:10:25.740 --> 00:10:27.070 align:middle line:90%
Don gets on the phone.

00:10:27.070 --> 00:10:29.130 align:middle line:90%
Scott, John Drake died.

00:10:29.130 --> 00:10:30.050 align:middle line:90%
I got a package.

00:10:30.050 --> 00:10:30.940 align:middle line:90%
Don't open it.

00:10:30.940 --> 00:10:32.020 align:middle line:90%
I'll be right there.

00:10:32.020 --> 00:10:34.000 align:middle line:84%
We jump in the car, and
we drive to New York.

00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:35.200 align:middle line:90%
I'm not making this up.

00:10:35.200 --> 00:10:39.980 align:middle line:84%
And boy, this is the most
fun I've ever had in my life.

00:10:39.980 --> 00:10:42.400 align:middle line:90%
Anyway, so check this out.

00:10:42.400 --> 00:10:45.450 align:middle line:84%
So in one of the packages,
there was a letter

00:10:45.450 --> 00:10:48.910 align:middle line:84%
that Bill wrote to a
guy named John Lennon.

00:10:48.910 --> 00:10:51.240 align:middle line:84%
He lived in Scotland
at the time,

00:10:51.240 --> 00:10:53.050 align:middle line:90%
and he worked for Scotland Yard.

00:10:53.050 --> 00:10:56.230 align:middle line:84%
And anytime Spartan
had missions,

00:10:56.230 --> 00:10:58.270 align:middle line:84%
the guys would go
to British Isles.

00:10:58.270 --> 00:11:00.160 align:middle line:90%
He was the liaison.

00:11:00.160 --> 00:11:03.060 align:middle line:84%
Well, he gave him some
stuff, and in the stuff

00:11:03.060 --> 00:11:04.600 align:middle line:90%
was a letter that he wrote.

00:11:04.600 --> 00:11:07.510 align:middle line:84%
It's a beautiful letter that
answered a lot of our questions,

00:11:07.510 --> 00:11:09.570 align:middle line:84%
but this is the
part that's cool.

00:11:09.570 --> 00:11:12.030 align:middle line:84%
He says, "Don Ruh is
the only person that

00:11:12.030 --> 00:11:14.550 align:middle line:84%
took my research seriously
and has helped me

00:11:14.550 --> 00:11:18.480 align:middle line:84%
with it over the years, so I
include this portion to him

00:11:18.480 --> 00:11:21.880 align:middle line:84%
but wish to do so after I
have departed this Earth.

00:11:21.880 --> 00:11:24.850 align:middle line:84%
Since he is the youngest
of the Spartan personnel,

00:11:24.850 --> 00:11:28.380 align:middle line:84%
I think he will survive long
enough for the current political

00:11:28.380 --> 00:11:32.430 align:middle line:84%
situation in America to have
passed on, leaving what I hope

00:11:32.430 --> 00:11:36.010 align:middle line:84%
will be a more open government
with less red tape."

00:11:36.010 --> 00:11:40.660 align:middle line:84%
And when Don read this, he went,
huh, Bill would be disappointed.

00:11:40.660 --> 00:11:46.610 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHS] Yeah, sadly, he would.

00:11:46.610 --> 00:11:50.140 align:middle line:90%
It's gotten worse, not better.

00:11:50.140 --> 00:11:52.875 align:middle line:90%
So this is the Title Page.

00:11:52.875 --> 00:11:56.850 align:middle line:90%


00:11:56.850 --> 00:12:01.260 align:middle line:84%
In Latin, that veritas vos
liberabit means "the truth will

00:12:01.260 --> 00:12:03.470 align:middle line:90%
set you free."

00:12:03.470 --> 00:12:07.240 align:middle line:10%
It's comprised of reports, all--

00:12:07.240 --> 00:12:11.740 align:middle line:10%
this is one in French that
was encrypted but then was

00:12:11.740 --> 00:12:13.690 align:middle line:10%
decoded into French.

00:12:13.690 --> 00:12:16.150 align:middle line:10%
Maps, letters.

00:12:16.150 --> 00:12:21.100 align:middle line:84%
That's a letter that was written
sometime between 1772 when

00:12:21.100 --> 00:12:24.370 align:middle line:84%
the guy that wrote it
died and 1749 because he

00:12:24.370 --> 00:12:28.370 align:middle line:84%
mentions that date
twice in the letter.

00:12:28.370 --> 00:12:31.200 align:middle line:90%
And encrypted documents.

00:12:31.200 --> 00:12:34.220 align:middle line:84%
We have, so far, 15
encrypted documents

00:12:34.220 --> 00:12:38.700 align:middle line:84%
that have come to us
that we've deciphered.

00:12:38.700 --> 00:12:43.050 align:middle line:84%
So remember, I was telling you
that the first message talks

00:12:43.050 --> 00:12:45.160 align:middle line:84%
about them going
under the South Wall,

00:12:45.160 --> 00:12:48.160 align:middle line:90%
the Templars, back around 1118.

00:12:48.160 --> 00:12:52.350 align:middle line:84%
And this document is encrypted,
and it's a first-hand narrative

00:12:52.350 --> 00:12:56.430 align:middle line:84%
about their getting in and
going underneath the South Wall

00:12:56.430 --> 00:13:01.120 align:middle line:84%
and finding an underground
ritual chamber.

00:13:01.120 --> 00:13:02.290 align:middle line:90%
This is in Jerusalem.

00:13:02.290 --> 00:13:05.940 align:middle line:84%
Inside that ritual chamber
were four stone boxes

00:13:05.940 --> 00:13:07.440 align:middle line:90%
called ossuaries.

00:13:07.440 --> 00:13:09.240 align:middle line:84%
Do you guys know
what ossuaries are?

00:13:09.240 --> 00:13:12.040 align:middle line:84%
Well, these are
ossuaries right here.

00:13:12.040 --> 00:13:15.810 align:middle line:10%
And basically, back in
the first century and only

00:13:15.810 --> 00:13:17.350 align:middle line:10%
in the first century--

00:13:17.350 --> 00:13:19.150 align:middle line:10%
because when the Romans
crushed the Jews,

00:13:19.150 --> 00:13:20.500 align:middle line:10%
this practice was over.

00:13:20.500 --> 00:13:23.750 align:middle line:10%
This was practiced by Essenes.

00:13:23.750 --> 00:13:25.700 align:middle line:84%
They're part of the
Templar tradition

00:13:25.700 --> 00:13:27.560 align:middle line:90%
back in their time period.

00:13:27.560 --> 00:13:30.560 align:middle line:84%
But when somebody passed
away, only the body

00:13:30.560 --> 00:13:34.490 align:middle line:84%
of the members of the
family could process

00:13:34.490 --> 00:13:35.850 align:middle line:90%
the body of the deceased.

00:13:35.850 --> 00:13:37.350 align:middle line:84%
And what they would
do is bring them

00:13:37.350 --> 00:13:40.710 align:middle line:84%
into an underground
chamber that had two rooms.

00:13:40.710 --> 00:13:44.570 align:middle line:84%
One was called an antechamber,
where the south end would be

00:13:44.570 --> 00:13:46.410 align:middle line:90%
open to the sky, to the world.

00:13:46.410 --> 00:13:49.010 align:middle line:90%
So this was the antechamber.

00:13:49.010 --> 00:13:52.650 align:middle line:84%
This would be open and
surrounded by rock on all sides.

00:13:52.650 --> 00:13:56.360 align:middle line:84%
Then there was an entrance
from the antechamber

00:13:56.360 --> 00:13:59.770 align:middle line:84%
into a burial chamber,
the second room.

00:13:59.770 --> 00:14:01.600 align:middle line:84%
And what they would
do is the family

00:14:01.600 --> 00:14:04.760 align:middle line:84%
would anoint the body
with perfumes and oils,

00:14:04.760 --> 00:14:07.930 align:middle line:84%
wrap it in a shroud, and
then bring it into the burial

00:14:07.930 --> 00:14:11.470 align:middle line:84%
chamber, and put it on one
of these benches, where it

00:14:11.470 --> 00:14:13.350 align:middle line:90%
would sit for one to two years.

00:14:13.350 --> 00:14:15.650 align:middle line:84%
The body would
decompose and desiccate,

00:14:15.650 --> 00:14:17.710 align:middle line:84%
and then they would
collect the bones

00:14:17.710 --> 00:14:21.400 align:middle line:84%
and put them in these bone
boxes, these ossuaries that

00:14:21.400 --> 00:14:24.640 align:middle line:84%
were only big enough so the
two largest bones in the body

00:14:24.640 --> 00:14:26.330 align:middle line:90%
would fit in, crossed.

00:14:26.330 --> 00:14:28.250 align:middle line:90%
The skull would go in last.

00:14:28.250 --> 00:14:31.540 align:middle line:84%
And now the origin of the
skull and crossbones symbol.

00:14:31.540 --> 00:14:33.200 align:middle line:90%
That's what it goes back to.

00:14:33.200 --> 00:14:37.540 align:middle line:10%
And it's interesting that the
Templars, after the put down,

00:14:37.540 --> 00:14:39.345 align:middle line:10%
became pirates.

00:14:39.345 --> 00:14:41.810 align:middle line:10%
And what would they fly?

00:14:41.810 --> 00:14:43.320 align:middle line:90%
The Jolly Roger.

00:14:43.320 --> 00:14:46.410 align:middle line:84%
It was an ode to their
ancient tradition.

00:14:46.410 --> 00:14:54.610 align:middle line:10%
So now getting back, they found
four ossuaries in this tomb.

00:14:54.610 --> 00:14:56.820 align:middle line:84%
In the first one--
oh, there you go--

00:14:56.820 --> 00:15:00.190 align:middle line:84%
[CHUCKLES] they
found 12 scrolls,

00:15:00.190 --> 00:15:03.020 align:middle line:84%
written in ancient
Hebrew script,

00:15:03.020 --> 00:15:05.150 align:middle line:84%
which is called
scriptio continua.

00:15:05.150 --> 00:15:08.540 align:middle line:84%
There's no breaks, there's
no periods, no punctuations.

00:15:08.540 --> 00:15:10.960 align:middle line:84%
It's just letters, and you
have to separate it out

00:15:10.960 --> 00:15:14.180 align:middle line:84%
into what the message says,
into the different words.

00:15:14.180 --> 00:15:18.060 align:middle line:84%
In the second ossuary, they
found gold, pretty excited

00:15:18.060 --> 00:15:21.510 align:middle line:84%
about that, with
the Hebrew symbol.

00:15:21.510 --> 00:15:24.650 align:middle line:84%
The Ivri is the old
word for Hebrew,

00:15:24.650 --> 00:15:29.270 align:middle line:84%
and it had the Seal of
Solomon symbol on it, back.

00:15:29.270 --> 00:15:31.040 align:middle line:90%
It was stamped on the gold.

00:15:31.040 --> 00:15:34.070 align:middle line:84%
The other thing that they
found in the third ossuary

00:15:34.070 --> 00:15:36.840 align:middle line:90%
were five devices.

00:15:36.840 --> 00:15:40.340 align:middle line:90%
Two were used for navigation.

00:15:40.340 --> 00:15:44.600 align:middle line:84%
Two were used for construction,
and one was a cryptex

00:15:44.600 --> 00:15:47.990 align:middle line:84%
that you needed to be able to
decipher the scrolls that they

00:15:47.990 --> 00:15:50.080 align:middle line:90%
found.

00:15:50.080 --> 00:15:53.830 align:middle line:10%
In the last box, the
fourth box they found--

00:15:53.830 --> 00:15:55.780 align:middle line:10%
well, they found science.

00:15:55.780 --> 00:15:59.380 align:middle line:84%
In the fourth box,
they found the remains

00:15:59.380 --> 00:16:05.260 align:middle line:84%
of a person whose head had been
severed with a heavy, sharp ax.

00:16:05.260 --> 00:16:10.090 align:middle line:10%
On the side of the box, the name
that was carved on it was Yon.

00:16:10.090 --> 00:16:13.730 align:middle line:84%
There was no J back
then, John the Baptist.

00:16:13.730 --> 00:16:16.700 align:middle line:90%
Bernard bags the bones.

00:16:16.700 --> 00:16:18.050 align:middle line:90%
They took them.

00:16:18.050 --> 00:16:20.410 align:middle line:84%
The question is,
where are they today?

00:16:20.410 --> 00:16:22.410 align:middle line:90%
John the Baptist.

00:16:22.410 --> 00:16:26.570 align:middle line:84%
So once they--
actually, what happened

00:16:26.570 --> 00:16:29.540 align:middle line:84%
was those scrolls were sent
to Bernard of Clairvaux,

00:16:29.540 --> 00:16:33.540 align:middle line:84%
who then sent them to a woman
named Hildegard of Bingen.

00:16:33.540 --> 00:16:38.290 align:middle line:10%
And she used that cryptex, and
she deciphered the messages

00:16:38.290 --> 00:16:44.120 align:middle line:10%
that talked about other scrolls
hidden in the land of Onteora,

00:16:44.120 --> 00:16:45.610 align:middle line:10%
North America.

00:16:45.610 --> 00:16:49.120 align:middle line:10%
And so what happened is, six
decades later, Sir Ralph de

00:16:49.120 --> 00:16:52.150 align:middle line:10%
Sudeley was-- a total of six
Templar Knights, including

00:16:52.150 --> 00:16:57.940 align:middle line:10%
himself, and 144 men and
women mounted an expedition

00:16:57.940 --> 00:17:00.140 align:middle line:10%
to go recover those scrolls.

00:17:00.140 --> 00:17:02.960 align:middle line:10%
That was their mission, to go
to the Temple of the Goddess,

00:17:02.960 --> 00:17:07.010 align:middle line:10%
which is in upstate New
York on Hunter Mountain

00:17:07.010 --> 00:17:10.280 align:middle line:10%
to recover those scrolls.

00:17:10.280 --> 00:17:14.569 align:middle line:84%
It's a three-year voyage
that began in Wales.

00:17:14.569 --> 00:17:18.020 align:middle line:90%
Six ships, 140 men and women.

00:17:18.020 --> 00:17:21.720 align:middle line:84%
And the Navigator was a woman by
the name of Princess Altomara.

00:17:21.720 --> 00:17:25.160 align:middle line:84%
She was the one that was
killed, and it was her ashes

00:17:25.160 --> 00:17:28.800 align:middle line:84%
that they found all
those years later.

00:17:28.800 --> 00:17:32.080 align:middle line:90%
We 20 and 6 disembarked.

00:17:32.080 --> 00:17:35.610 align:middle line:84%
I just want to point out
that 26 is 2 times 13.

00:17:35.610 --> 00:17:41.040 align:middle line:84%
The numerology is very important
and serves as internal evidence

00:17:41.040 --> 00:17:44.310 align:middle line:84%
in these documents that
help prove the veracity

00:17:44.310 --> 00:17:45.250 align:middle line:90%
of these documents.

00:17:45.250 --> 00:17:48.330 align:middle line:84%
And this is just one example
of a billion examples

00:17:48.330 --> 00:17:52.070 align:middle line:90%
of internal evidence.

00:17:52.070 --> 00:17:54.440 align:middle line:84%
Altomara led them to the
Temple of the Goddess

00:17:54.440 --> 00:17:56.870 align:middle line:90%
in the land called Onteora.

00:17:56.870 --> 00:18:00.050 align:middle line:84%
That was the name
that was inscribed

00:18:00.050 --> 00:18:01.760 align:middle line:84%
on one of those
metal inserts that

00:18:01.760 --> 00:18:05.660 align:middle line:84%
led Bill to buy the
document in the first place.

00:18:05.660 --> 00:18:10.550 align:middle line:84%
And then the story of
what happened is amazing,

00:18:10.550 --> 00:18:13.930 align:middle line:84%
but there was a three-day
ritual that suddenly

00:18:13.930 --> 00:18:17.590 align:middle line:84%
had to go through with the
priestess and the people

00:18:17.590 --> 00:18:20.830 align:middle line:84%
of the Temple of the Goddess in
three different caves in three

00:18:20.830 --> 00:18:21.830 align:middle line:90%
different nights.

00:18:21.830 --> 00:18:25.210 align:middle line:84%
And on the last night, the
priestess enters the cave

00:18:25.210 --> 00:18:29.470 align:middle line:90%
and offers herself to him.

00:18:29.470 --> 00:18:32.120 align:middle line:90%
And he says, I'm sorry, I can't.

00:18:32.120 --> 00:18:33.650 align:middle line:90%
I took vows of chastity.

00:18:33.650 --> 00:18:36.350 align:middle line:90%
And she said, you pass.

00:18:36.350 --> 00:18:39.250 align:middle line:84%
You can have the scrolls,
which was pretty cool.

00:18:39.250 --> 00:18:41.240 align:middle line:84%
When you read the
story, it's really cool.

00:18:41.240 --> 00:18:43.880 align:middle line:84%
But he couldn't take
all the scrolls.

00:18:43.880 --> 00:18:47.430 align:middle line:84%
He was allowed to take
half of the scrolls.

00:18:47.430 --> 00:18:51.700 align:middle line:84%
And then they wintered over on
the East End of Long Island.

00:18:51.700 --> 00:18:53.980 align:middle line:84%
They built a ship,
and they sailed back.

00:18:53.980 --> 00:18:57.250 align:middle line:10%
They arrived in the
spring to Seborga, Italy,

00:18:57.250 --> 00:18:59.700 align:middle line:10%
where his deposition was taken.

00:18:59.700 --> 00:19:03.240 align:middle line:10%
And there were two monks that
recorded it, one for the church

00:19:03.240 --> 00:19:05.110 align:middle line:10%
and one for the order.

00:19:05.110 --> 00:19:08.200 align:middle line:90%
And that is this story.

00:19:08.200 --> 00:19:10.535 align:middle line:90%
So it's pretty cool.

00:19:10.535 --> 00:19:13.100 align:middle line:90%


00:19:13.100 --> 00:19:18.090 align:middle line:84%
So the question is, how did
Don get this information?

00:19:18.090 --> 00:19:21.100 align:middle line:84%
You remember when he said,
he would be disappointed?

00:19:21.100 --> 00:19:24.780 align:middle line:84%
That was here, this day,
right-- this had just happened,

00:19:24.780 --> 00:19:26.510 align:middle line:90%
and I filmed this whole thing.

00:19:26.510 --> 00:19:29.550 align:middle line:84%
Anyway, here's some more
Theban in this document,

00:19:29.550 --> 00:19:30.980 align:middle line:90%
and that's another story.

00:19:30.980 --> 00:19:36.550 align:middle line:10%
But in 2017, Bill's
daughter, Melissa,

00:19:36.550 --> 00:19:41.100 align:middle line:10%
sent a package a week and a
half after Rick Lagina with

00:19:41.100 --> 00:19:45.240 align:middle line:10%
"The Curse of Oak Island"
had visited Don and gave him

00:19:45.240 --> 00:19:47.420 align:middle line:10%
a contract to come on the show.

00:19:47.420 --> 00:19:50.140 align:middle line:10%
And Don turned it
down, of course.

00:19:50.140 --> 00:19:55.750 align:middle line:10%
Anyway Melissa had-- one of
the things she gave, Don,

00:19:55.750 --> 00:20:00.210 align:middle line:10%
were two treasure maps and
the first page of the Cremona

00:20:00.210 --> 00:20:05.020 align:middle line:10%
Document, which has the cipher
phrase Aelia Capitolina,

00:20:05.020 --> 00:20:08.520 align:middle line:10%
the old name of Jerusalem
back 2,000 years ago.

00:20:08.520 --> 00:20:13.540 align:middle line:84%
That is mandatory to be
able to decode the story.

00:20:13.540 --> 00:20:16.040 align:middle line:84%
So the Vatican bought
a worthless document.

00:20:16.040 --> 00:20:20.400 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHS] I love this guy.

00:20:20.400 --> 00:20:24.430 align:middle line:84%
Anyway, John Drake died,
John Lennon, Dan Spartan.

00:20:24.430 --> 00:20:28.460 align:middle line:84%
This is us opening the Dan
Spartan box back in 2021.

00:20:28.460 --> 00:20:31.860 align:middle line:10%
Oh, my God, the stuff that was
in there, including a map that

00:20:31.860 --> 00:20:36.920 align:middle line:10%
was 3 feet by 2 feet that has--

00:20:36.920 --> 00:20:42.440 align:middle line:10%
its map 8 that has 13
parts, Fibonacci sequence

00:20:42.440 --> 00:20:46.910 align:middle line:10%
again, with all the
treasure sites, all of them.

00:20:46.910 --> 00:20:48.650 align:middle line:90%
It's fantastic.

00:20:48.650 --> 00:20:51.760 align:middle line:84%
And then Dave Rian,
and then Roberta.

00:20:51.760 --> 00:20:54.760 align:middle line:90%


00:20:54.760 --> 00:20:58.570 align:middle line:84%
So I want to mention quickly
the Sinclair/Wemyss journals.

00:20:58.570 --> 00:21:03.950 align:middle line:84%
Another person called me in
2016 who had watched the show

00:21:03.950 --> 00:21:08.490 align:middle line:84%
and said, I have the journals
of Earl Henry Sinclair.

00:21:08.490 --> 00:21:10.360 align:middle line:90%
I said, sure you do.

00:21:10.360 --> 00:21:11.790 align:middle line:90%
This is in the email.

00:21:11.790 --> 00:21:13.000 align:middle line:90%
Delete.

00:21:13.000 --> 00:21:14.310 align:middle line:90%
She wrote back the next day.

00:21:14.310 --> 00:21:16.330 align:middle line:84%
She said, no, really, I've
got the journals of Earl Henry

00:21:16.330 --> 00:21:17.130 align:middle line:90%
Sinclair.

00:21:17.130 --> 00:21:18.040 align:middle line:90%
Sure you do.

00:21:18.040 --> 00:21:19.770 align:middle line:90%
Delete.

00:21:19.770 --> 00:21:22.510 align:middle line:84%
Then a week later,
she sent me one more.

00:21:22.510 --> 00:21:24.940 align:middle line:84%
She told me, she goes, I was
going to try one more time.

00:21:24.940 --> 00:21:28.762 align:middle line:84%
She said, this time, I added
pictures and her phone number.

00:21:28.762 --> 00:21:29.970 align:middle line:90%
And I looked at the pictures.

00:21:29.970 --> 00:21:31.262 align:middle line:90%
I go, [MIMICS DIALING TONE] hi.

00:21:31.262 --> 00:21:32.630 align:middle line:90%
[CHUCKLES]

00:21:32.630 --> 00:21:36.800 align:middle line:84%
So eventually, I met with
her, and she brought with her

00:21:36.800 --> 00:21:37.710 align:middle line:90%
this map.

00:21:37.710 --> 00:21:39.060 align:middle line:90%
It's a lambskin map.

00:21:39.060 --> 00:21:40.860 align:middle line:84%
I'm not going to show
you what's on it,

00:21:40.860 --> 00:21:44.210 align:middle line:84%
but it's a map that was
made by Antonio Zeno, who

00:21:44.210 --> 00:21:47.660 align:middle line:84%
sailed with Earl Henry
Sinclair to the New World

00:21:47.660 --> 00:21:51.730 align:middle line:84%
to bury treasures
in the New World

00:21:51.730 --> 00:21:53.370 align:middle line:90%
that the Templars escaped with.

00:21:53.370 --> 00:21:55.370 align:middle line:90%
Remember that story?

00:21:55.370 --> 00:21:57.910 align:middle line:84%
If you've heard the story
of the Templars in 1307

00:21:57.910 --> 00:22:00.010 align:middle line:84%
when they were put down,
and the King of France

00:22:00.010 --> 00:22:04.720 align:middle line:84%
sends his church
agents to the Treasury

00:22:04.720 --> 00:22:06.680 align:middle line:90%
at the headquarters in Paris.

00:22:06.680 --> 00:22:08.710 align:middle line:84%
And they open it up,
and everything was gone.

00:22:08.710 --> 00:22:11.660 align:middle line:84%
Then they went to the Western
port of La Rochelle in France,

00:22:11.660 --> 00:22:15.010 align:middle line:84%
and the 18 ships that were there
that were loaded with treasure

00:22:15.010 --> 00:22:18.080 align:middle line:84%
were gone and
disappeared into history.

00:22:18.080 --> 00:22:20.080 align:middle line:84%
Well, they didn't
disappear into history.

00:22:20.080 --> 00:22:21.800 align:middle line:90%
They went to Isle of Man.

00:22:21.800 --> 00:22:25.300 align:middle line:84%
They went to Scotland, came
over here in the latter part

00:22:25.300 --> 00:22:26.510 align:middle line:90%
of the 14th century.

00:22:26.510 --> 00:22:30.400 align:middle line:84%
And they buried him
in multiple places,

00:22:30.400 --> 00:22:35.290 align:middle line:84%
including Oak
Island for someday.

00:22:35.290 --> 00:22:38.090 align:middle line:84%
Anyway, something
really cool here,

00:22:38.090 --> 00:22:40.340 align:middle line:84%
and this is one of the
journals right here.

00:22:40.340 --> 00:22:47.280 align:middle line:84%
Now, these journals were written
by two prominent Scottish clans.

00:22:47.280 --> 00:22:49.630 align:middle line:84%
This was a
father-to-son tradition.

00:22:49.630 --> 00:22:52.390 align:middle line:84%
When the treasures were
brought over by Earl Henry,

00:22:52.390 --> 00:22:55.890 align:middle line:84%
his son was obligated to go
over and check on the treasures

00:22:55.890 --> 00:22:59.060 align:middle line:84%
to make sure
everything was safe.

00:22:59.060 --> 00:23:02.060 align:middle line:84%
You were to visit the Western
lands to check on the treasures

00:23:02.060 --> 00:23:04.710 align:middle line:84%
twice in your lifetime,
once with your father,

00:23:04.710 --> 00:23:06.030 align:middle line:90%
once with your son.

00:23:06.030 --> 00:23:09.470 align:middle line:84%
And they all did it except
for two generations of the 15

00:23:09.470 --> 00:23:14.020 align:middle line:90%
generations that did this.

00:23:14.020 --> 00:23:19.320 align:middle line:84%
The first entry to the
last spans 417 years,

00:23:19.320 --> 00:23:24.980 align:middle line:84%
the first one in 1353,
the last in 1770.

00:23:24.980 --> 00:23:26.610 align:middle line:90%
There's 20 volumes.

00:23:26.610 --> 00:23:31.460 align:middle line:84%
13 were written in Latin,
two in Old English, and 5

00:23:31.460 --> 00:23:32.820 align:middle line:90%
in Modern English.

00:23:32.820 --> 00:23:36.780 align:middle line:84%
This is one of the last
ones in modern English.

00:23:36.780 --> 00:23:39.900 align:middle line:84%
And one map compiled
by Antonio Zeno.

00:23:39.900 --> 00:23:43.000 align:middle line:90%
And Earl Henry came over twice.

00:23:43.000 --> 00:23:44.440 align:middle line:84%
He actually came
over three times,

00:23:44.440 --> 00:23:48.000 align:middle line:84%
once when he was eight years
old, once in 1395, and once

00:23:48.000 --> 00:23:49.500 align:middle line:90%
in 1398.

00:23:49.500 --> 00:23:52.030 align:middle line:84%
This map was made
by Antonio Zeno.

00:23:52.030 --> 00:23:53.880 align:middle line:90%
That's 1395.

00:23:53.880 --> 00:23:55.265 align:middle line:90%
But you look at his sigla.

00:23:55.265 --> 00:23:57.280 align:middle line:90%
You know what a sigla is, right?

00:23:57.280 --> 00:23:59.530 align:middle line:84%
It's a fancy way of
writing your initials,

00:23:59.530 --> 00:24:01.620 align:middle line:90%
all tied in one symbol.

00:24:01.620 --> 00:24:04.380 align:middle line:90%
So you see the A, Z, right?

00:24:04.380 --> 00:24:05.750 align:middle line:90%
But there's more to it.

00:24:05.750 --> 00:24:08.810 align:middle line:90%


00:24:08.810 --> 00:24:11.510 align:middle line:90%
That's the fish symbol.

00:24:11.510 --> 00:24:12.960 align:middle line:90%
The fish.

00:24:12.960 --> 00:24:14.510 align:middle line:90%
Remember the vesica piscis?

00:24:14.510 --> 00:24:18.560 align:middle line:90%


00:24:18.560 --> 00:24:25.400 align:middle line:84%
And the M-- together, they
make the symbol of what?

00:24:25.400 --> 00:24:27.203 align:middle line:90%
Virgo, the goddess.

00:24:27.203 --> 00:24:31.140 align:middle line:90%


00:24:31.140 --> 00:24:32.680 align:middle line:90%
Here are some of the entries.

00:24:32.680 --> 00:24:36.780 align:middle line:84%
May 5, 1395, Earl
Henry's 49 years old.

00:24:36.780 --> 00:24:39.900 align:middle line:84%
"We leave this daybreak from
Kirkwall for the western banks

00:24:39.900 --> 00:24:41.950 align:middle line:84%
with the blessings
of King Robert--"

00:24:41.950 --> 00:24:46.761 align:middle line:84%
this would be King Robert
III, Robert the Bruce III--

00:24:46.761 --> 00:24:49.980 align:middle line:84%
"with the support of the hirdmen
who will oversee my obligations

00:24:49.980 --> 00:24:51.970 align:middle line:90%
in Orknades while I am gone.

00:24:51.970 --> 00:24:55.500 align:middle line:84%
Our goal is to find a better
route to the empires of China

00:24:55.500 --> 00:24:59.150 align:middle line:84%
further south than the
ice-covered lakes."

00:24:59.150 --> 00:25:01.400 align:middle line:90%
Those are the Great Lakes.

00:25:01.400 --> 00:25:05.230 align:middle line:84%
I thought Chris didn't
get here till 1492.

00:25:05.230 --> 00:25:06.380 align:middle line:90%
How did they know about it?

00:25:06.380 --> 00:25:10.210 align:middle line:84%
Because they'd already
been here many times.

00:25:10.210 --> 00:25:12.340 align:middle line:84%
"And suitable land
for settlement

00:25:12.340 --> 00:25:14.660 align:middle line:84%
beyond the boundaries
of Groenland,

00:25:14.660 --> 00:25:16.520 align:middle line:90%
which we visited on our journey.

00:25:16.520 --> 00:25:22.360 align:middle line:84%
We also travel with 120
remaining Knights Templars,

00:25:22.360 --> 00:25:25.420 align:middle line:84%
descendants of those
at Bannockburn under

00:25:25.420 --> 00:25:28.190 align:middle line:84%
my grandfather's rule--" that
would be King Robert the Bruce

00:25:28.190 --> 00:25:31.790 align:middle line:84%
I, in search of a
free Templar state."

00:25:31.790 --> 00:25:33.430 align:middle line:90%
They served at Bannockburn.

00:25:33.430 --> 00:25:35.480 align:middle line:84%
Have you guys heard of
the Battle of Bannockburn?

00:25:35.480 --> 00:25:38.140 align:middle line:84%
It's the greatest battle
in the history of Scotland,

00:25:38.140 --> 00:25:40.980 align:middle line:84%
when King Robert the Bruce
defeated the English.

00:25:40.980 --> 00:25:42.230 align:middle line:90%
It's like their big day.

00:25:42.230 --> 00:25:44.630 align:middle line:90%
It's like their 1776.

00:25:44.630 --> 00:25:47.260 align:middle line:84%
Well, there's a legend
that the Templars helped

00:25:47.260 --> 00:25:49.880 align:middle line:90%
turn the battle to the Scots.

00:25:49.880 --> 00:25:55.540 align:middle line:84%
Well, according to this, that
legend is, in fact, true.

00:25:55.540 --> 00:25:59.770 align:middle line:84%
"We search for suitable places
to transfer the Templar treasure

00:25:59.770 --> 00:26:02.660 align:middle line:90%
hidden in Scotland."

00:26:02.660 --> 00:26:06.470 align:middle line:84%
And on that map, there
are eight locations.

00:26:06.470 --> 00:26:09.960 align:middle line:84%
And then they went back again,
and they put nine locations.

00:26:09.960 --> 00:26:13.420 align:middle line:84%
And then they went back again,
and there were a whole bunch.

00:26:13.420 --> 00:26:17.460 align:middle line:84%
Oak Island is one of
about 30 locations.

00:26:17.460 --> 00:26:19.402 align:middle line:90%
Templars aren't stupid.

00:26:19.402 --> 00:26:21.485 align:middle line:84%
They would never put all
their eggs in one basket.

00:26:21.485 --> 00:26:24.290 align:middle line:90%


00:26:24.290 --> 00:26:27.300 align:middle line:90%
James Wemyss wrote this in 1560.

00:26:27.300 --> 00:26:29.660 align:middle line:84%
"I leave this morrow to
visit the Western Lands

00:26:29.660 --> 00:26:32.050 align:middle line:84%
with my grandson,
David of Wemyss.

00:26:32.050 --> 00:26:37.520 align:middle line:84%
I pray that Holy Father
and the Holy Goddess

00:26:37.520 --> 00:26:39.620 align:middle line:84%
will strengthen me
and allow me to pass

00:26:39.620 --> 00:26:40.920 align:middle line:90%
this task to my grandson.

00:26:40.920 --> 00:26:43.820 align:middle line:84%
We must first find the
first markers left behind

00:26:43.820 --> 00:26:46.890 align:middle line:84%
by Sir Duncan and secure
the help of the Ahherah,

00:26:46.890 --> 00:26:48.420 align:middle line:90%
the Indigenous people.

00:26:48.420 --> 00:26:50.960 align:middle line:84%
They worship the Great
Goddess and have been allies

00:26:50.960 --> 00:26:54.300 align:middle line:84%
of the Covenant for
over 200 years."

00:26:54.300 --> 00:27:00.840 align:middle line:84%
This mission to establish this
sanctuary, this free Templar

00:27:00.840 --> 00:27:06.340 align:middle line:84%
state, this new Jerusalem,
this new Atlantis,

00:27:06.340 --> 00:27:12.190 align:middle line:84%
according to Brother Francis
Bacon, was called the Covenant.

00:27:12.190 --> 00:27:14.500 align:middle line:84%
A covenant is an
agreement with deity.

00:27:14.500 --> 00:27:17.680 align:middle line:84%
It's the highest agreement,
the most sacred agreement

00:27:17.680 --> 00:27:19.330 align:middle line:90%
you can have.

00:27:19.330 --> 00:27:21.720 align:middle line:90%
And they took it seriously.

00:27:21.720 --> 00:27:23.700 align:middle line:10%
And I think this is
an important point

00:27:23.700 --> 00:27:28.030 align:middle line:10%
to point out or point
in time to point out.

00:27:28.030 --> 00:27:31.860 align:middle line:84%
And I'll get to the
end of this in a sec.

00:27:31.860 --> 00:27:35.740 align:middle line:84%
The reason the Templars
could go all over the world,

00:27:35.740 --> 00:27:38.830 align:middle line:84%
and especially in North
America and South America

00:27:38.830 --> 00:27:41.060 align:middle line:84%
where they spent
most of their time,

00:27:41.060 --> 00:27:45.290 align:middle line:84%
was because they bonded
with the Indigenous people

00:27:45.290 --> 00:27:51.100 align:middle line:84%
through ritual, Freemasonry,
and intermarriage.

00:27:51.100 --> 00:27:53.710 align:middle line:84%
And basically, what the
natives said is, look,

00:27:53.710 --> 00:27:55.680 align:middle line:90%
you are our brothers.

00:27:55.680 --> 00:27:57.297 align:middle line:84%
You want us to guard
these treasures?

00:27:57.297 --> 00:27:58.630 align:middle line:90%
They didn't care about treasure.

00:27:58.630 --> 00:27:59.980 align:middle line:90%
It meant nothing to them.

00:27:59.980 --> 00:28:03.510 align:middle line:84%
But it means something to
you, so we will guard it.

00:28:03.510 --> 00:28:06.433 align:middle line:90%
And they did that for 400 years.

00:28:06.433 --> 00:28:09.220 align:middle line:90%


00:28:09.220 --> 00:28:11.200 align:middle line:84%
Eventually, you
know what happened.

00:28:11.200 --> 00:28:14.830 align:middle line:84%
They recovered those treasures,
and they founded America.

00:28:14.830 --> 00:28:16.720 align:middle line:84%
So when we start
patting ourselves

00:28:16.720 --> 00:28:21.530 align:middle line:84%
on the back as Freemasons
and as white people,

00:28:21.530 --> 00:28:24.530 align:middle line:84%
we need to remember that
our founding fathers did

00:28:24.530 --> 00:28:25.990 align:middle line:90%
a great job.

00:28:25.990 --> 00:28:31.200 align:middle line:84%
But the natives--
they did it with them,

00:28:31.200 --> 00:28:32.890 align:middle line:90%
and we have to remember them.

00:28:32.890 --> 00:28:34.650 align:middle line:84%
The other thing you're
going to find out

00:28:34.650 --> 00:28:37.540 align:middle line:84%
is that when they did go
to recover those treasures,

00:28:37.540 --> 00:28:40.460 align:middle line:84%
they brought slaves
with them, who

00:28:40.460 --> 00:28:42.840 align:middle line:90%
were given their manumission.

00:28:42.840 --> 00:28:44.300 align:middle line:84%
Do you know what
a manumission-- do

00:28:44.300 --> 00:28:45.550 align:middle line:90%
you know what that word means?

00:28:45.550 --> 00:28:46.410 align:middle line:90%
I didn't.

00:28:46.410 --> 00:28:47.580 align:middle line:90%
I had to look it up.

00:28:47.580 --> 00:28:50.060 align:middle line:84%
It means to give a
slave their freedom.

00:28:50.060 --> 00:28:52.800 align:middle line:84%
And they went up there and
helped recover those slaves.

00:28:52.800 --> 00:28:56.220 align:middle line:84%
So when we celebrate
our independence,

00:28:56.220 --> 00:28:59.120 align:middle line:84%
it's not just our
founding fathers.

00:28:59.120 --> 00:29:02.000 align:middle line:84%
It's these Indigenous people
that we owe a debt of gratitude

00:29:02.000 --> 00:29:05.480 align:middle line:84%
to and these African
American slaves.

00:29:05.480 --> 00:29:09.040 align:middle line:90%
And how did we thank them?

00:29:09.040 --> 00:29:12.100 align:middle line:90%
The word is genocide.

00:29:12.100 --> 00:29:13.278 align:middle line:90%
But I will tell you this.

00:29:13.278 --> 00:29:15.070 align:middle line:84%
One of the first things
that occurred to me

00:29:15.070 --> 00:29:17.140 align:middle line:84%
when I figured out
the Runestone was real

00:29:17.140 --> 00:29:21.020 align:middle line:84%
and we started trying to
answer those other questions--

00:29:21.020 --> 00:29:25.500 align:middle line:84%
I said to myself, well, if
they're traipsing over here all

00:29:25.500 --> 00:29:27.180 align:middle line:84%
the way to Minnesota,
wouldn't they

00:29:27.180 --> 00:29:29.340 align:middle line:84%
have interacted
with the natives?

00:29:29.340 --> 00:29:30.630 align:middle line:90%
Duh.

00:29:30.630 --> 00:29:34.490 align:middle line:84%
So we reached out to them
and I actually participated

00:29:34.490 --> 00:29:36.300 align:middle line:90%
in a Midewiwin sweat.

00:29:36.300 --> 00:29:38.130 align:middle line:84%
You probably don't
know what that word is,

00:29:38.130 --> 00:29:41.310 align:middle line:84%
but Midewiwin is the secret
society of the natives.

00:29:41.310 --> 00:29:44.550 align:middle line:84%
That's what they call
their Freemasonry.

00:29:44.550 --> 00:29:46.680 align:middle line:84%
And so when I went
into the sweat

00:29:46.680 --> 00:29:49.770 align:middle line:84%
and I finally earned my
right to ask questions,

00:29:49.770 --> 00:29:52.840 align:middle line:84%
the medicine man said, Scott,
what do you want to know?

00:29:52.840 --> 00:29:54.840 align:middle line:84%
I said, well, I'd like
to ask you some questions

00:29:54.840 --> 00:29:55.950 align:middle line:90%
about the Knights Templar.

00:29:55.950 --> 00:29:59.510 align:middle line:84%
He said, oh, you mean
our blood brothers?

00:29:59.510 --> 00:30:01.540 align:middle line:90%
It went pretty good after that.

00:30:01.540 --> 00:30:04.330 align:middle line:84%
So I just want to make
sure that I point that out

00:30:04.330 --> 00:30:07.390 align:middle line:84%
because it wasn't just
our founding fathers.

00:30:07.390 --> 00:30:09.710 align:middle line:90%
Anyway.

00:30:09.710 --> 00:30:12.070 align:middle line:84%
William "The Builder--"
do you know who he is?

00:30:12.070 --> 00:30:15.010 align:middle line:84%
How many have heard
of Rosslyn Chapel?

00:30:15.010 --> 00:30:16.060 align:middle line:90%
He built it.

00:30:16.060 --> 00:30:18.120 align:middle line:84%
That's why he's called
William "The Builder."

00:30:18.120 --> 00:30:22.660 align:middle line:10%
He went over when he was 24,
and he met with these guys

00:30:22.660 --> 00:30:25.670 align:middle line:10%
that his grandfather
had brought over.

00:30:25.670 --> 00:30:28.030 align:middle line:10%
They were old men by
this time, married

00:30:28.030 --> 00:30:30.710 align:middle line:10%
and living in these
communities with the natives.

00:30:30.710 --> 00:30:34.720 align:middle line:10%
And they were telling William
stories about his grandfather

00:30:34.720 --> 00:30:37.850 align:middle line:10%
that he never met, that, we
find out in the journals,

00:30:37.850 --> 00:30:40.710 align:middle line:10%
died four years
before he was born.

00:30:40.710 --> 00:30:44.740 align:middle line:10%
And in the journals, he writes,
"When I return to Scotland,

00:30:44.740 --> 00:30:49.860 align:middle line:10%
I resolve to build an edifice in
stone in honor of my grandfather

00:30:49.860 --> 00:30:52.380 align:middle line:10%
and the knights
who stayed behind."

00:30:52.380 --> 00:30:55.080 align:middle line:10%
And they were guarding
the treasures.

00:30:55.080 --> 00:31:00.040 align:middle line:10%
Anyway, a free Templar state.

00:31:00.040 --> 00:31:03.820 align:middle line:90%
Now, this is amazing.

00:31:03.820 --> 00:31:06.500 align:middle line:10%
Flash forward, the last guy
to write in the journals,

00:31:06.500 --> 00:31:10.180 align:middle line:10%
we call him John Wemyss Jr.
because his dad was John Wemyss

00:31:10.180 --> 00:31:12.610 align:middle line:10%
Sr. We just call him Junior.

00:31:12.610 --> 00:31:15.010 align:middle line:84%
He was living in North
Carolina, and he got a message

00:31:15.010 --> 00:31:15.830 align:middle line:90%
from his father.

00:31:15.830 --> 00:31:19.850 align:middle line:84%
It said, son, I need to see
you as soon as possible.

00:31:19.850 --> 00:31:20.830 align:middle line:90%
It's very important.

00:31:20.830 --> 00:31:22.180 align:middle line:90%
Get here as quickly as you can.

00:31:22.180 --> 00:31:23.660 align:middle line:90%
I'm paraphrasing.

00:31:23.660 --> 00:31:27.180 align:middle line:84%
And he scooted up, and he went
to Abington, Pennsylvania.

00:31:27.180 --> 00:31:30.710 align:middle line:84%
It's about a 20-minute
drive north of Philadelphia.

00:31:30.710 --> 00:31:32.808 align:middle line:84%
And when he went
there, he showed up.

00:31:32.808 --> 00:31:34.850 align:middle line:84%
His father said, son,
you're to go with these two

00:31:34.850 --> 00:31:37.730 align:middle line:84%
men of his father's age
and read these journals,

00:31:37.730 --> 00:31:39.140 align:middle line:90%
and you'll understand.

00:31:39.140 --> 00:31:42.740 align:middle line:84%
It was his turn to go
check on the treasures.

00:31:42.740 --> 00:31:46.060 align:middle line:90%
This is 1769.

00:31:46.060 --> 00:31:47.380 align:middle line:90%
He goes up there.

00:31:47.380 --> 00:31:48.590 align:middle line:90%
Everything's fine.

00:31:48.590 --> 00:31:49.480 align:middle line:90%
He comes back.

00:31:49.480 --> 00:31:52.790 align:middle line:84%
And about 2 and 1/2 months
later, his father said, son,

00:31:52.790 --> 00:31:55.040 align:middle line:84%
the political
situation has changed.

00:31:55.040 --> 00:31:56.590 align:middle line:84%
You need to round
up a bunch of men.

00:31:56.590 --> 00:31:59.530 align:middle line:84%
And next year, you're going to
go back and get the treasures.

00:31:59.530 --> 00:32:00.950 align:middle line:90%
So he did that.

00:32:00.950 --> 00:32:06.820 align:middle line:84%
He rounded up 46 men, all
Freemasons, and 6 slaves,

00:32:06.820 --> 00:32:09.060 align:middle line:90%
and they went up.

00:32:09.060 --> 00:32:13.860 align:middle line:84%
But before they left, there was
a secret meeting in Abington

00:32:13.860 --> 00:32:16.290 align:middle line:84%
at a place called the
Friends' School, a Quaker

00:32:16.290 --> 00:32:17.110 align:middle line:90%
Friends' School.

00:32:17.110 --> 00:32:18.490 align:middle line:90%
And it's still there.

00:32:18.490 --> 00:32:23.200 align:middle line:84%
This space has been added on
six times, but it's still there.

00:32:23.200 --> 00:32:24.250 align:middle line:90%
And I'll never forget.

00:32:24.250 --> 00:32:27.140 align:middle line:84%
We gave a tour there, and
there were people there.

00:32:27.140 --> 00:32:30.340 align:middle line:84%
And I was standing in this
space, and I read this entry.

00:32:30.340 --> 00:32:34.280 align:middle line:90%
And I was literally shaking.

00:32:34.280 --> 00:32:37.430 align:middle line:84%
"My father, having been raised
to the status of Master Mason

00:32:37.430 --> 00:32:41.420 align:middle line:84%
in the 46th British Regiment--"
we had to go to Canada to vet

00:32:41.420 --> 00:32:48.350 align:middle line:84%
this because he was British, but
their obligation to the covenant

00:32:48.350 --> 00:32:51.650 align:middle line:84%
was more important than
their allegiance to the Crown

00:32:51.650 --> 00:32:55.350 align:middle line:84%
and to the craft,
to Freemasonry.

00:32:55.350 --> 00:32:57.090 align:middle line:10%
"Which was presided
over the meeting,

00:32:57.090 --> 00:33:00.750 align:middle line:10%
was attended by William Ball
of Philadelphia and Benjamin

00:33:00.750 --> 00:33:04.240 align:middle line:10%
Franklin, the former Provincial
Grand Master of Pennsylvania."

00:33:04.240 --> 00:33:07.220 align:middle line:10%
Remember, we weren't
a country yet.

00:33:07.220 --> 00:33:09.140 align:middle line:84%
"The Brethren gathered
in the schoolhouse,

00:33:09.140 --> 00:33:10.970 align:middle line:84%
and for three hours,
were impressed upon

00:33:10.970 --> 00:33:14.250 align:middle line:84%
by the presiding Brethren the
importance of their mission.

00:33:14.250 --> 00:33:16.190 align:middle line:10%
We were each divided
into groups of five

00:33:16.190 --> 00:33:18.560 align:middle line:10%
and told to embrace each
other in the coming journey

00:33:18.560 --> 00:33:21.290 align:middle line:10%
and to learn to trust and
depend upon each other

00:33:21.290 --> 00:33:25.350 align:middle line:10%
as it would become vitally
important in our task.

00:33:25.350 --> 00:33:28.310 align:middle line:84%
The presiding Brethren also
imparted their knowledge

00:33:28.310 --> 00:33:31.730 align:middle line:84%
of current political
events and told us

00:33:31.730 --> 00:33:35.300 align:middle line:84%
that it was immensely important
that the Templar Treasure find

00:33:35.300 --> 00:33:38.880 align:middle line:90%
its way back to the Grand Lodge.

00:33:38.880 --> 00:33:41.713 align:middle line:84%
We would soon lose control of
the territory in Nova Scotia,

00:33:41.713 --> 00:33:43.380 align:middle line:84%
and the Brethren
feared it would be lost

00:33:43.380 --> 00:33:45.580 align:middle line:90%
if not retrieved straight away.

00:33:45.580 --> 00:33:48.990 align:middle line:10%
They reiterated that secrecy
was of the utmost importance

00:33:48.990 --> 00:33:51.600 align:middle line:10%
and that we would always be
surrounded by British troops,

00:33:51.600 --> 00:33:54.760 align:middle line:10%
who might report
our every move."

00:33:54.760 --> 00:33:57.670 align:middle line:84%
Brother Franklin reminded
us that no matter

00:33:57.670 --> 00:34:00.590 align:middle line:84%
what our political or
religious leanings,

00:34:00.590 --> 00:34:03.950 align:middle line:84%
our loyalty to the Brethren
was most important.

00:34:03.950 --> 00:34:06.970 align:middle line:84%
We must honor our commitment
and remember our vows,

00:34:06.970 --> 00:34:11.889 align:middle line:84%
or the burgeoning nation of free
men might never come to pass.

00:34:11.889 --> 00:34:16.150 align:middle line:84%
This is a 28-year-old guy
who led this mission up,

00:34:16.150 --> 00:34:19.006 align:middle line:90%
and they got him, obviously.

00:34:19.006 --> 00:34:22.420 align:middle line:90%
[CHUCKLES] Isn't that amazing?

00:34:22.420 --> 00:34:25.690 align:middle line:84%
You didn't read about this
in Franklin's memoirs.

00:34:25.690 --> 00:34:28.239 align:middle line:90%
He didn't tell anyone.

00:34:28.239 --> 00:34:33.850 align:middle line:84%
So remember the last
person, Roberta?

00:34:33.850 --> 00:34:36.060 align:middle line:84%
So when Don and I and
Janet were sitting

00:34:36.060 --> 00:34:40.280 align:middle line:84%
in the woods, that picture where
we're smiling in the woods,

00:34:40.280 --> 00:34:43.370 align:middle line:84%
we had just
recovered a treasure.

00:34:43.370 --> 00:34:46.305 align:middle line:90%
And we were just freaking.

00:34:46.305 --> 00:34:50.100 align:middle line:84%
So at one point, we
look at Don and go, Don,

00:34:50.100 --> 00:34:52.320 align:middle line:90%
is there anybody left?

00:34:52.320 --> 00:34:55.250 align:middle line:84%
Like, is anyone else going
to die and leave you stuff?

00:34:55.250 --> 00:34:56.300 align:middle line:90%
He said, no.

00:34:56.300 --> 00:34:59.260 align:middle line:84%
He said, McMasters, he
and Bill never got along.

00:34:59.260 --> 00:35:01.560 align:middle line:84%
Bill wouldn't have
left anything for him.

00:35:01.560 --> 00:35:06.990 align:middle line:84%
And then he goes,
Bill had a girlfriend.

00:35:06.990 --> 00:35:09.530 align:middle line:90%


00:35:09.530 --> 00:35:12.000 align:middle line:90%
Well, guess what?

00:35:12.000 --> 00:35:15.360 align:middle line:90%
The Goddess came through.

00:35:15.360 --> 00:35:21.070 align:middle line:84%
She had about 50 pages
of encrypted messages,

00:35:21.070 --> 00:35:23.340 align:middle line:90%
six encrypted messages.

00:35:23.340 --> 00:35:25.180 align:middle line:90%
She wanted 300 bucks.

00:35:25.180 --> 00:35:28.410 align:middle line:84%
I couldn't lay that
money out fast enough.

00:35:28.410 --> 00:35:33.720 align:middle line:84%
Half of the content
is about Oak Island.

00:35:33.720 --> 00:35:36.300 align:middle line:84%
You aren't even
going to believe it.

00:35:36.300 --> 00:35:40.170 align:middle line:84%
I'm telling you, it's
amazing, everything--

00:35:40.170 --> 00:35:41.640 align:middle line:90%
everything.

00:35:41.640 --> 00:35:42.440 align:middle line:90%
Anyway.

00:35:42.440 --> 00:35:46.590 align:middle line:90%


00:35:46.590 --> 00:35:49.550 align:middle line:90%
So this is one of them.

00:35:49.550 --> 00:35:52.020 align:middle line:10%
And it says, "The power
of God is within you,"

00:35:52.020 --> 00:35:54.860 align:middle line:10%
which ended up being the cipher
phrase for some of the other

00:35:54.860 --> 00:35:56.310 align:middle line:10%
ones.

00:35:56.310 --> 00:36:01.980 align:middle line:10%
This is the final writing of
this report, first done in 1308

00:36:01.980 --> 00:36:05.700 align:middle line:10%
and revised three
times till 1908.

00:36:05.700 --> 00:36:10.770 align:middle line:84%
So what Bill brought was
the final revised document

00:36:10.770 --> 00:36:13.450 align:middle line:90%
that was done in 1908.

00:36:13.450 --> 00:36:18.500 align:middle line:84%
The final putting of
the relic is told here.

00:36:18.500 --> 00:36:21.880 align:middle line:90%
What's the relic?

00:36:21.880 --> 00:36:26.650 align:middle line:84%
Remember we talked about
relic in the very beginning.

00:36:26.650 --> 00:36:30.100 align:middle line:84%
This is the account of the
journey and the 300-year project

00:36:30.100 --> 00:36:35.170 align:middle line:84%
to secure the relic, now held
by Lionel de Waldern III,

00:36:35.170 --> 00:36:39.520 align:middle line:84%
one of the six knights that went
over to recover the scrolls was

00:36:39.520 --> 00:36:42.850 align:middle line:90%
Lionel de Waldern I.

00:36:42.850 --> 00:36:47.310 align:middle line:84%
The Last Supper Cup or the
skull of John the Baptist--

00:36:47.310 --> 00:36:51.180 align:middle line:84%
we know they got the
skull of John the Baptist.

00:36:51.180 --> 00:36:52.010 align:middle line:90%
We know that.

00:36:52.010 --> 00:36:52.810 align:middle line:90%
It's that.

00:36:52.810 --> 00:36:55.640 align:middle line:90%


00:36:55.640 --> 00:36:59.040 align:middle line:84%
Here's another one of
the encrypted messages.

00:36:59.040 --> 00:37:05.400 align:middle line:84%
It's got 24 sections of
12 lines, 24 of them.

00:37:05.400 --> 00:37:10.590 align:middle line:84%
The message is 6609
characters long.

00:37:10.590 --> 00:37:12.540 align:middle line:90%
Again, scriptio continua.

00:37:12.540 --> 00:37:15.660 align:middle line:90%
We had to put the words in.

00:37:15.660 --> 00:37:17.680 align:middle line:84%
This one is mostly
about Oak Island.

00:37:17.680 --> 00:37:18.580 align:middle line:90%
What happened there?

00:37:18.580 --> 00:37:21.170 align:middle line:10%
"The power of God
is within you."

00:37:21.170 --> 00:37:25.120 align:middle line:10%
So as I'm deciphering this,
I get to a certain point.

00:37:25.120 --> 00:37:28.682 align:middle line:84%
And if the phrase came
up and it was misspelled,

00:37:28.682 --> 00:37:30.390 align:middle line:84%
"The power of God,"
then I screwed it up.

00:37:30.390 --> 00:37:31.870 align:middle line:90%
And I screwed it up plenty.

00:37:31.870 --> 00:37:34.770 align:middle line:84%
But they put it
in there 13 times

00:37:34.770 --> 00:37:39.270 align:middle line:84%
to make sure you were
getting the message right.

00:37:39.270 --> 00:37:43.420 align:middle line:10%
Hooked Xs all through them.

00:37:43.420 --> 00:37:46.660 align:middle line:90%
This is one page of my work.

00:37:46.660 --> 00:37:51.460 align:middle line:10%
I just want to point out "Lionel
de Waldern VI grows strong like

00:37:51.460 --> 00:37:52.300 align:middle line:10%
his father."

00:37:52.300 --> 00:37:55.550 align:middle line:84%
That'd be the V.
"He has two sons."

00:37:55.550 --> 00:37:57.860 align:middle line:90%
That would be the VII.

00:37:57.860 --> 00:38:01.830 align:middle line:90%
"And I am his second son."

00:38:01.830 --> 00:38:06.950 align:middle line:84%
Ueire pledged to the
service of the angel Kay."

00:38:06.950 --> 00:38:08.940 align:middle line:90%
Who's Kay?

00:38:08.940 --> 00:38:11.130 align:middle line:10%
Hold that thought.

00:38:11.130 --> 00:38:13.140 align:middle line:84%
Dave Rian, when
he passed, left us

00:38:13.140 --> 00:38:17.700 align:middle line:90%
a cryptogram that was 13 parts.

00:38:17.700 --> 00:38:23.070 align:middle line:84%
And he left the alphabet
down here, which was nice.

00:38:23.070 --> 00:38:26.380 align:middle line:84%
And this was done
in 1898, ironically,

00:38:26.380 --> 00:38:29.280 align:middle line:84%
the same year the Kensington
Runestone was found.

00:38:29.280 --> 00:38:33.300 align:middle line:84%
And there's a messy, hooked
X. That was just simply

00:38:33.300 --> 00:38:34.910 align:middle line:90%
an acknowledgment of deity.

00:38:34.910 --> 00:38:38.455 align:middle line:90%


00:38:38.455 --> 00:38:41.440 align:middle line:10%
13 parts.

00:38:41.440 --> 00:38:45.250 align:middle line:84%
OK, Now I want you
guys to help me.

00:38:45.250 --> 00:38:46.970 align:middle line:10%
I'm a rock head.

00:38:46.970 --> 00:38:48.080 align:middle line:10%
I'm a geologist.

00:38:48.080 --> 00:38:49.540 align:middle line:10%
I run a lab.

00:38:49.540 --> 00:38:51.930 align:middle line:90%
That's what I do.

00:38:51.930 --> 00:38:54.590 align:middle line:84%
I've never had anything
against aliens.

00:38:54.590 --> 00:38:57.120 align:middle line:90%
I just never thought about it.

00:38:57.120 --> 00:38:58.120 align:middle line:90%
Well, guess what?

00:38:58.120 --> 00:39:00.470 align:middle line:90%
They had other plans for me.

00:39:00.470 --> 00:39:03.720 align:middle line:84%
So you help me understand
what this says.

00:39:03.720 --> 00:39:06.500 align:middle line:90%
And I'm serious.

00:39:06.500 --> 00:39:08.250 align:middle line:10%
"I saw the lights again."

00:39:08.250 --> 00:39:11.240 align:middle line:90%
Remember, this is 1898.

00:39:11.240 --> 00:39:12.660 align:middle line:90%
"Could be an ill omen.

00:39:12.660 --> 00:39:15.090 align:middle line:84%
The right one descended
upon my winter lodge.

00:39:15.090 --> 00:39:18.150 align:middle line:84%
And behold, there stood
the likeness of a mon."

00:39:18.150 --> 00:39:20.580 align:middle line:90%
We thought it was "a man."

00:39:20.580 --> 00:39:25.440 align:middle line:10%
But every time we ran
it through, it was an O,

00:39:25.440 --> 00:39:29.970 align:middle line:10%
not an A. And maybe it's
not "a mon" or "a man,"

00:39:29.970 --> 00:39:31.280 align:middle line:10%
or maybe it's "amon."

00:39:31.280 --> 00:39:34.250 align:middle line:90%


00:39:34.250 --> 00:39:36.600 align:middle line:84%
"He was of common dress
and medium height.

00:39:36.600 --> 00:39:40.220 align:middle line:84%
He had about the eyes
shown a light blue."

00:39:40.220 --> 00:39:43.300 align:middle line:90%
There were no planes back then.

00:39:43.300 --> 00:39:44.590 align:middle line:90%
What descended?

00:39:44.590 --> 00:39:45.610 align:middle line:90%
A light.

00:39:45.610 --> 00:39:48.800 align:middle line:90%
What is he talking about?

00:39:48.800 --> 00:39:50.730 align:middle line:84%
"So I know the lights
are of angels."

00:39:50.730 --> 00:39:52.230 align:middle line:84%
There's a whole
bunch in the middle.

00:39:52.230 --> 00:39:54.230 align:middle line:10%
It's not relevant.

00:39:54.230 --> 00:39:56.400 align:middle line:90%
"Yet, all are not of the Lord.

00:39:56.400 --> 00:39:58.070 align:middle line:90%
Some are of his brother."

00:39:58.070 --> 00:40:00.470 align:middle line:90%
Now, this is his wife.

00:40:00.470 --> 00:40:03.380 align:middle line:10%
But then he says, "So
has passed the scroll

00:40:03.380 --> 00:40:06.190 align:middle line:10%
of the Wars of the Lord
from the world of men.

00:40:06.190 --> 00:40:09.990 align:middle line:84%
Know by my sigal of my
ancestors all I write is true.

00:40:09.990 --> 00:40:11.900 align:middle line:90%
Tala' co, Gray, CLY."

00:40:11.900 --> 00:40:15.290 align:middle line:10%
CLY was the guy that did all the
copying because his sigla is all

00:40:15.290 --> 00:40:16.730 align:middle line:10%
through it.

00:40:16.730 --> 00:40:18.950 align:middle line:10%
But he also had a native name.

00:40:18.950 --> 00:40:20.885 align:middle line:90%
He was Gray Eagle.

00:40:20.885 --> 00:40:23.620 align:middle line:90%


00:40:23.620 --> 00:40:27.060 align:middle line:10%
Roberta's message number four--

00:40:27.060 --> 00:40:29.840 align:middle line:10%
"the cup of our
Lord Christ Jesus."

00:40:29.840 --> 00:40:35.570 align:middle line:10%
They brought that over here,
too, and it's here now.

00:40:35.570 --> 00:40:39.030 align:middle line:90%
So the free Templar state--

00:40:39.030 --> 00:40:41.680 align:middle line:90%


00:40:41.680 --> 00:40:44.710 align:middle line:84%
the Templars founded
this nation in part

00:40:44.710 --> 00:40:48.100 align:middle line:84%
because they wanted to establish
a place that would be free

00:40:48.100 --> 00:40:50.380 align:middle line:84%
from the tyranny of
the monarchs of Europe,

00:40:50.380 --> 00:40:53.340 align:middle line:84%
free from the persecution of
the Roman Catholic Church.

00:40:53.340 --> 00:40:57.100 align:middle line:10%
And it's interesting that
in Parsifal, 12th century,

00:40:57.100 --> 00:41:00.190 align:middle line:10%
is the first time we
hear somebody talk about,

00:41:00.190 --> 00:41:04.730 align:middle line:10%
every human being is born with
certain inalienable rights,

00:41:04.730 --> 00:41:08.130 align:middle line:10%
regardless of color, creed,
nationality, whatever.

00:41:08.130 --> 00:41:12.020 align:middle line:10%
All I know is everybody in this
room and everybody in the world,

00:41:12.020 --> 00:41:15.920 align:middle line:10%
if I cut you, your blood is red.

00:41:15.920 --> 00:41:20.310 align:middle line:84%
We all need to
remember that, I think.

00:41:20.310 --> 00:41:21.920 align:middle line:90%
Rights of the individual.

00:41:21.920 --> 00:41:23.850 align:middle line:10%
The founding fathers
finished the job

00:41:23.850 --> 00:41:27.630 align:middle line:10%
the Templars started 600 years
earlier through a covenant

00:41:27.630 --> 00:41:31.320 align:middle line:10%
with the Goddess by the
establishment of the Free

00:41:31.320 --> 00:41:34.980 align:middle line:10%
Templar State we now call
the United States of America.

00:41:34.980 --> 00:41:38.600 align:middle line:10%
Could America be the
Templars' "Holy Grail?"

00:41:38.600 --> 00:41:41.600 align:middle line:90%


00:41:41.600 --> 00:41:44.120 align:middle line:84%
So let's go back through
our list real quick.

00:41:44.120 --> 00:41:46.190 align:middle line:90%
Cup at the Last Supper--

00:41:46.190 --> 00:41:48.470 align:middle line:90%
yep.

00:41:48.470 --> 00:41:52.640 align:middle line:10%
Treasure-- oh, yeah,
lots of treasure.

00:41:52.640 --> 00:41:58.660 align:middle line:10%
Relics-- yep, and I haven't
told you about all of them.

00:41:58.660 --> 00:42:00.540 align:middle line:10%
Certainly the skull
of John the Baptist.

00:42:00.540 --> 00:42:03.880 align:middle line:90%


00:42:03.880 --> 00:42:07.570 align:middle line:10%
The bloodline-- Bernhard
and his family members

00:42:07.570 --> 00:42:09.110 align:middle line:10%
and Lionel de Waldern.

00:42:09.110 --> 00:42:10.520 align:middle line:10%
You met seven of them.

00:42:10.520 --> 00:42:14.480 align:middle line:84%
What I didn't introduce you
to was Lionel de Waldern XXI,

00:42:14.480 --> 00:42:17.170 align:middle line:84%
who wrote a letter
about his mission

00:42:17.170 --> 00:42:22.180 align:middle line:84%
to recover the rest of
the scrolls, which he did.

00:42:22.180 --> 00:42:25.480 align:middle line:10%
So the Bloodline is
certainly part of this.

00:42:25.480 --> 00:42:28.150 align:middle line:10%
Alchemy/science-- I
mean, the Templars

00:42:28.150 --> 00:42:29.950 align:middle line:10%
were masters of navigation.

00:42:29.950 --> 00:42:32.590 align:middle line:84%
These towers were
also used to calculate

00:42:32.590 --> 00:42:34.280 align:middle line:90%
the circumference of the Earth.

00:42:34.280 --> 00:42:35.940 align:middle line:90%
Is that important?

00:42:35.940 --> 00:42:36.740 align:middle line:90%
Hell, yes.

00:42:36.740 --> 00:42:39.460 align:middle line:84%
If you're sailing on the oceans,
you know how much food and water

00:42:39.460 --> 00:42:40.640 align:middle line:90%
to pack for.

00:42:40.640 --> 00:42:43.160 align:middle line:84%
That gives you an advantage
over your competition.

00:42:43.160 --> 00:42:47.050 align:middle line:84%
This is just one example of
how science and knowledge gave

00:42:47.050 --> 00:42:50.500 align:middle line:84%
the Templars an advantage,
and this knowledge

00:42:50.500 --> 00:42:51.830 align:middle line:90%
came from the Atlanteans.

00:42:51.830 --> 00:42:54.520 align:middle line:90%
That's where they got it.

00:42:54.520 --> 00:42:57.610 align:middle line:10%
Spiritual
enlightenment-- Yahweh.

00:42:57.610 --> 00:42:59.030 align:middle line:10%
I didn't tell you about this.

00:42:59.030 --> 00:43:01.370 align:middle line:84%
But in "The Book of
the Wars of the Lord,"

00:43:01.370 --> 00:43:04.040 align:middle line:84%
which is one of the documents
that was hidden over there,

00:43:04.040 --> 00:43:06.460 align:middle line:84%
that, to this day, if
you google it, it'll say,

00:43:06.460 --> 00:43:10.210 align:middle line:84%
there is no extant copy known
to exist in the world today.

00:43:10.210 --> 00:43:12.810 align:middle line:84%
We have two parts of
it in these documents.

00:43:12.810 --> 00:43:15.970 align:middle line:10%
In one of the parts, it
talks about how Yahweh,

00:43:15.970 --> 00:43:21.580 align:middle line:10%
which is the Hebrew word for
"deity," is actually "Yah"

00:43:21.580 --> 00:43:25.670 align:middle line:10%
and "Weh," male, female.

00:43:25.670 --> 00:43:28.310 align:middle line:84%
And the way you pronounce
it is you go in the middle,

00:43:28.310 --> 00:43:30.870 align:middle line:84%
and you pronounce it
backwards, inside out.

00:43:30.870 --> 00:43:34.730 align:middle line:90%
And it's pronounced "hoohee."

00:43:34.730 --> 00:43:37.800 align:middle line:84%
And anyway, there's
a lot more to that.

00:43:37.800 --> 00:43:40.520 align:middle line:84%
So yeah, that's an
enlightening thing.

00:43:40.520 --> 00:43:42.470 align:middle line:84%
The balance we
talked about, it's

00:43:42.470 --> 00:43:46.660 align:middle line:84%
the hooked X. Sacred
feminine-- the Goddess is all

00:43:46.660 --> 00:43:49.040 align:middle line:90%
through this stuff.

00:43:49.040 --> 00:43:51.460 align:middle line:10%
And the New Jerusalem--

00:43:51.460 --> 00:43:55.040 align:middle line:10%
Kensington Runestone land
claim to establish America.

00:43:55.040 --> 00:43:57.190 align:middle line:84%
They didn't need to
recover the Runestone,

00:43:57.190 --> 00:44:00.825 align:middle line:84%
because the founding
fathers finished the job.

00:44:00.825 --> 00:44:08.680 align:middle line:84%
So in light of all of this and
all of that, let me ask you

00:44:08.680 --> 00:44:09.740 align:middle line:90%
this--

00:44:09.740 --> 00:44:17.810 align:middle line:84%
could the Holy Grail
actually be truth?

00:44:17.810 --> 00:44:19.430 align:middle line:90%
I like that myself.

00:44:19.430 --> 00:44:21.230 align:middle line:90%
Thank you so much for coming.

00:44:21.230 --> 00:44:22.730 align:middle line:84%
Have a great time
at the conference.

00:44:22.730 --> 00:44:23.930 align:middle line:90%
