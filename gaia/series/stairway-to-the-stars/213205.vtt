00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:17.350 align:middle line:90%
>> Thank you.

00:00:17.350 --> 00:00:19.270 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:00:19.270 --> 00:00:22.130 align:middle line:10%
It's really, really
cool to see all here.

00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:23.920 align:middle line:10%
Thank you so much for coming.

00:00:23.920 --> 00:00:25.580 align:middle line:90%
We really appreciate it.

00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:28.480 align:middle line:84%
I know that you're here
because we were saying we're

00:00:28.480 --> 00:00:29.732 align:middle line:90%
going to give out free donuts.

00:00:29.732 --> 00:00:30.690 align:middle line:90%
That's why you're here.

00:00:30.690 --> 00:00:33.300 align:middle line:90%


00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:34.430 align:middle line:90%
But thank you very much.

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:36.180 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to go right
into this to give us

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:39.600 align:middle line:84%
as much time as possible so
Bashar can deliver whatever

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:41.200 align:middle line:90%
message he's going to deliver.

00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:42.880 align:middle line:84%
And then you can
ask your question.

00:00:42.880 --> 00:00:44.770 align:middle line:90%
So again, thank you for coming.

00:00:44.770 --> 00:00:47.510 align:middle line:84%
Please have a wonderful
time, and I'll see you later.

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:51.690 align:middle line:90%


00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:52.490 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

I want to say good day to
you this day of your time.

00:01:43.750 --> 00:01:45.150 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:01:45.150 --> 00:01:50.820 align:middle line:84%
We have titled this
Transmission in Two Worlds.

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:53.100 align:middle line:84%
The idea here is
that we are going

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:57.960 align:middle line:84%
to describe, a little bit more
clearly, the nature of ourselves

00:01:57.960 --> 00:01:59.820 align:middle line:84%
and many of the
extraterrestrial,

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:02.550 align:middle line:84%
extra dimensional beings
that are observing,

00:02:02.550 --> 00:02:05.790 align:middle line:84%
watching, engaging,
participating with what

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:09.060 align:middle line:84%
is going on your planet
at this time of transition

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:11.480 align:middle line:90%
and transformation.

00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:16.370 align:middle line:84%
We have talked about the idea
that we operate, many of us--

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:18.410 align:middle line:90%
not all of us, but many of us--

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:22.550 align:middle line:84%
on a certain vibratory frequency
that is very, very fast,

00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:23.930 align:middle line:90%
very high.

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:29.900 align:middle line:84%
We have talked about the idea
that many people, if they

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:33.590 align:middle line:84%
were to be exposed to
that frequency too soon,

00:02:33.590 --> 00:02:37.640 align:middle line:84%
might experience the
idea of psychic shock.

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:44.260 align:middle line:84%
We have talked about the idea
that many people experience

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:48.430 align:middle line:84%
the expansion of their
consciousness, the connection

00:02:48.430 --> 00:02:50.800 align:middle line:90%
to spirituality.

00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:57.220 align:middle line:84%
The idea to understand is
that because many beings

00:02:57.220 --> 00:03:01.450 align:middle line:84%
exist between two
worlds, both physical

00:03:01.450 --> 00:03:03.730 align:middle line:84%
and non-physical,
quasi physical,

00:03:03.730 --> 00:03:07.030 align:middle line:84%
as we say, with elements
of physical reality,

00:03:07.030 --> 00:03:09.820 align:middle line:90%
elements of spirit beings.

00:03:09.820 --> 00:03:12.790 align:middle line:84%
When you get exposed,
to many of us,

00:03:12.790 --> 00:03:18.580 align:middle line:84%
in some of the encounters that
occur, the idea is that exposure

00:03:18.580 --> 00:03:22.840 align:middle line:84%
to that frequency isn't just
something that brings up

00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:26.530 align:middle line:84%
elements within you, that you
may not yet have integrated,

00:03:26.530 --> 00:03:28.780 align:middle line:84%
that are causing
the psychic shock.

00:03:28.780 --> 00:03:32.410 align:middle line:84%
But many of the reasons
that people feel fear

00:03:32.410 --> 00:03:35.890 align:middle line:84%
in the presence of beings
of this nature, beings

00:03:35.890 --> 00:03:41.410 align:middle line:84%
of this frequency is because
the frequency that we represent

00:03:41.410 --> 00:03:46.250 align:middle line:84%
is very similar to the
idea of the spirit level.

00:03:46.250 --> 00:03:50.210 align:middle line:84%
There is almost no difference
between our experience

00:03:50.210 --> 00:03:53.300 align:middle line:84%
of physical reality and
our experience of spirit

00:03:53.300 --> 00:03:55.670 align:middle line:90%
in this point in our evolution.

00:03:55.670 --> 00:03:58.070 align:middle line:84%
You are heading that
way, those of you

00:03:58.070 --> 00:04:00.470 align:middle line:84%
who have chosen to walk
the spiritual path.

00:04:00.470 --> 00:04:04.340 align:middle line:84%
Those of you who have chosen
to expand your consciousness,

00:04:04.340 --> 00:04:06.440 align:middle line:90%
you're not there quite yet.

00:04:06.440 --> 00:04:10.770 align:middle line:84%
But the idea is that exposure
to that vibration at this time.

00:04:10.770 --> 00:04:13.490 align:middle line:84%
And the reason that
many people feel

00:04:13.490 --> 00:04:15.530 align:middle line:84%
fear, the reason that
many people might

00:04:15.530 --> 00:04:19.279 align:middle line:84%
go into psychic shock is
that they are actually,

00:04:19.279 --> 00:04:23.390 align:middle line:84%
in our presence, beginning to
experience their life review.

00:04:23.390 --> 00:04:28.160 align:middle line:84%
The idea is you are
incorporating many experiences

00:04:28.160 --> 00:04:30.260 align:middle line:84%
and feeling the
connection that you

00:04:30.260 --> 00:04:34.070 align:middle line:84%
have to people who have been in
any way, shape, or form affected

00:04:34.070 --> 00:04:37.070 align:middle line:84%
by the choices you make
in life, and you feel it

00:04:37.070 --> 00:04:39.490 align:middle line:90%
as if it is happening to you.

00:04:39.490 --> 00:04:42.070 align:middle line:84%
The short way of
explaining this, and I

00:04:42.070 --> 00:04:44.170 align:middle line:84%
know that this may
sound funny to you,

00:04:44.170 --> 00:04:46.780 align:middle line:84%
but exposure to our
frequency actually

00:04:46.780 --> 00:04:50.330 align:middle line:84%
makes you feel like
you're about to die.

00:04:50.330 --> 00:04:53.390 align:middle line:84%
That's why the reactions
happen the way they happen,

00:04:53.390 --> 00:04:57.800 align:middle line:84%
and why we remain at arm's
length until such time.

00:04:57.800 --> 00:05:01.010 align:middle line:84%
As you raise your vibration
sufficiently, connect

00:05:01.010 --> 00:05:04.850 align:middle line:84%
to your higher mind sufficiently
to incorporate within you

00:05:04.850 --> 00:05:08.300 align:middle line:84%
the higher vibration that
will allow you to operate

00:05:08.300 --> 00:05:10.400 align:middle line:84%
at a different level that
is more vibrationally

00:05:10.400 --> 00:05:15.500 align:middle line:84%
compatible with who we are as
well, more in alignment with who

00:05:15.500 --> 00:05:18.500 align:middle line:84%
you truly are in
your essential core

00:05:18.500 --> 00:05:20.870 align:middle line:84%
to allow you to
remember who you are,

00:05:20.870 --> 00:05:24.380 align:middle line:84%
to express your energy
that is true for you

00:05:24.380 --> 00:05:26.270 align:middle line:84%
in a way that is
more vibrationally

00:05:26.270 --> 00:05:30.320 align:middle line:84%
compatible with the
reality in which we exist.

00:05:30.320 --> 00:05:33.500 align:middle line:84%
This is why many
encounters between species

00:05:33.500 --> 00:05:38.750 align:middle line:84%
like ourselves take place in
a slightly altered reality.

00:05:38.750 --> 00:05:42.440 align:middle line:84%
The idea is that you think
maybe sometimes the experience

00:05:42.440 --> 00:05:45.770 align:middle line:84%
you're having is taking place
in what you're familiar with

00:05:45.770 --> 00:05:48.530 align:middle line:84%
as physical reality,
but it isn't.

00:05:48.530 --> 00:05:50.363 align:middle line:84%
What many people on
your planet don't

00:05:50.363 --> 00:05:51.780 align:middle line:84%
understand that
there are actually

00:05:51.780 --> 00:05:54.090 align:middle line:90%
many layers to physical reality.

00:05:54.090 --> 00:05:56.340 align:middle line:84%
And sometimes, in
these encounters,

00:05:56.340 --> 00:05:59.950 align:middle line:84%
you are slightly shifted
upward in frequency.

00:05:59.950 --> 00:06:01.740 align:middle line:84%
And while you may
think you are still

00:06:01.740 --> 00:06:04.630 align:middle line:84%
in your typical physical
reality, you're not.

00:06:04.630 --> 00:06:08.820 align:middle line:84%
Because shifting you up into
that different layer of reality,

00:06:08.820 --> 00:06:11.340 align:middle line:84%
even though it may
still seem physical,

00:06:11.340 --> 00:06:14.010 align:middle line:84%
is what makes you slightly
more vibrationally

00:06:14.010 --> 00:06:17.380 align:middle line:84%
compatible to the
encounter happening.

00:06:17.380 --> 00:06:19.590 align:middle line:84%
And therefore, what we
are actually telling

00:06:19.590 --> 00:06:24.480 align:middle line:84%
you is this is why
the idea of exploring

00:06:24.480 --> 00:06:26.940 align:middle line:84%
the nature of
extraterrestrials, exploring

00:06:26.940 --> 00:06:29.670 align:middle line:84%
the idea of open
contact, exploring

00:06:29.670 --> 00:06:35.280 align:middle line:84%
the idea of UFOs or UAPs,
as you refer to us now,

00:06:35.280 --> 00:06:40.470 align:middle line:84%
is the idea that spirituality
has to go along with it.

00:06:40.470 --> 00:06:44.310 align:middle line:84%
It is not just the idea of what
you might call the old science

00:06:44.310 --> 00:06:49.050 align:middle line:84%
fiction scenario of spaceships
landing in physical reality,

00:06:49.050 --> 00:06:52.890 align:middle line:84%
getting out and shaking your
hand, but the idea that you are

00:06:52.890 --> 00:06:57.300 align:middle line:84%
going to encounter something
that is of a spirit nature,

00:06:57.300 --> 00:07:00.390 align:middle line:84%
of the nature of a
non-physical reality as well

00:07:00.390 --> 00:07:01.890 align:middle line:90%
as a physical reality.

00:07:01.890 --> 00:07:05.940 align:middle line:84%
You're going to encounter
things that exist in two worlds.

00:07:05.940 --> 00:07:08.970 align:middle line:84%
And for you to be vibrationally
compatible with us,

00:07:08.970 --> 00:07:11.170 align:middle line:90%
you have to live there too.

00:07:11.170 --> 00:07:14.400 align:middle line:84%
And this is why it is
so important for you

00:07:14.400 --> 00:07:16.860 align:middle line:84%
to connect the idea
of spirituality

00:07:16.860 --> 00:07:18.690 align:middle line:84%
and the expansion
of consciousness

00:07:18.690 --> 00:07:22.440 align:middle line:84%
to the entire endeavor
and the entire discipline

00:07:22.440 --> 00:07:25.840 align:middle line:90%
of extraterrestrial contact.

00:07:25.840 --> 00:07:28.870 align:middle line:84%
It is not just taking
place on a physical level.

00:07:28.870 --> 00:07:32.490 align:middle line:84%
It is taking place on different
levels of dimensionality

00:07:32.490 --> 00:07:34.560 align:middle line:84%
that you need to get
used to if you're

00:07:34.560 --> 00:07:37.770 align:middle line:84%
going to operate in the
reality that is representative

00:07:37.770 --> 00:07:39.460 align:middle line:90%
of open contact.

00:07:39.460 --> 00:07:40.780 align:middle line:90%
Do you understand?

00:07:40.780 --> 00:07:42.060 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes

00:07:42.060 --> 00:07:46.800 align:middle line:84%
>> So we thank you for
participating and being willing

00:07:46.800 --> 00:07:49.950 align:middle line:84%
to open up to the idea
of your spiritual truth,

00:07:49.950 --> 00:07:51.670 align:middle line:90%
your spiritual essence.

00:07:51.670 --> 00:07:54.780 align:middle line:84%
We thank you for being
willing to take those actions

00:07:54.780 --> 00:07:58.110 align:middle line:84%
and walk that path, because
that makes all the difference

00:07:58.110 --> 00:08:01.200 align:middle line:84%
in your reality and it
makes all the difference

00:08:01.200 --> 00:08:05.460 align:middle line:84%
in your ability to be able
to interact with all of us.

00:08:05.460 --> 00:08:08.610 align:middle line:84%
We encourage you to
continue along that path,

00:08:08.610 --> 00:08:11.130 align:middle line:84%
if you are willing
to, because that's

00:08:11.130 --> 00:08:13.890 align:middle line:84%
what's going to allow
the idea of open contact

00:08:13.890 --> 00:08:16.980 align:middle line:84%
to be experienced by each
and every one of you who

00:08:16.980 --> 00:08:19.000 align:middle line:90%
are willing to walk that path.

00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:22.920 align:middle line:84%
And we thank you for being
willing to expand our family

00:08:22.920 --> 00:08:27.956 align:middle line:90%
and become Homo galacticus.

00:08:27.956 --> 00:08:31.380 align:middle line:90%
[APPLAUSE AND CHEERING]

00:08:31.380 --> 00:08:36.030 align:middle line:84%
Now, again, keep in
mind, very important

00:08:36.030 --> 00:08:37.590 align:middle line:84%
that you continue
this path in order

00:08:37.590 --> 00:08:40.650 align:middle line:84%
to be actually vibrationally
compatible with being

00:08:40.650 --> 00:08:43.409 align:middle line:84%
able to interact with
the various forms

00:08:43.409 --> 00:08:46.530 align:middle line:84%
and species of extraterrestrial
and extra dimensional

00:08:46.530 --> 00:08:50.730 align:middle line:84%
beings that are engaged with you
and assisting you at this time

00:08:50.730 --> 00:08:53.580 align:middle line:84%
to transform and
transition in positive,

00:08:53.580 --> 00:08:56.270 align:middle line:84%
constructive, loving,
and creative ways.

00:08:56.270 --> 00:08:59.400 align:middle line:84%
For this is the vibration,
the essential vibration

00:08:59.400 --> 00:09:01.360 align:middle line:90%
of existence itself.

00:09:01.360 --> 00:09:03.870 align:middle line:84%
What you refer to as
unconditional love

00:09:03.870 --> 00:09:07.590 align:middle line:84%
is how you translate that
frequency of existence.

00:09:07.590 --> 00:09:10.330 align:middle line:84%
You may refer to it
as any name you wish.

00:09:10.330 --> 00:09:12.240 align:middle line:84%
You can call it god,
goddess, all that

00:09:12.240 --> 00:09:14.380 align:middle line:90%
is, however you wish to do it.

00:09:14.380 --> 00:09:17.520 align:middle line:84%
There is no name you
can think of that

00:09:17.520 --> 00:09:21.220 align:middle line:84%
isn't representative of it
because it is all things.

00:09:21.220 --> 00:09:24.270 align:middle line:84%
It is everything, everywhere,
every when, everyone.

00:09:24.270 --> 00:09:26.190 align:middle line:90%
There is nothing outside of it.

00:09:26.190 --> 00:09:30.310 align:middle line:84%
So the idea is it doesn't really
matter how you approach it.

00:09:30.310 --> 00:09:32.680 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't really
matter what you call it.

00:09:32.680 --> 00:09:35.210 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't really matter
how you represent it.

00:09:35.210 --> 00:09:38.500 align:middle line:84%
It is all the things you can
imagine because you cannot

00:09:38.500 --> 00:09:42.290 align:middle line:84%
imagine anything outside of it
because everything exists within

00:09:42.290 --> 00:09:43.090 align:middle line:90%
it.

00:09:43.090 --> 00:09:45.880 align:middle line:84%
So allow yourself to know
that it doesn't really

00:09:45.880 --> 00:09:48.640 align:middle line:84%
matter how you approach
it, what path you take,

00:09:48.640 --> 00:09:50.260 align:middle line:90%
what perspective you have.

00:09:50.260 --> 00:09:53.980 align:middle line:84%
You have, for yourself,
the perspective

00:09:53.980 --> 00:09:55.670 align:middle line:90%
that is true for you.

00:09:55.670 --> 00:09:58.120 align:middle line:84%
And it is just as
real and just as true

00:09:58.120 --> 00:10:01.030 align:middle line:84%
as any other perspective
of all that is because it

00:10:01.030 --> 00:10:04.230 align:middle line:90%
is everything that exists.

00:10:04.230 --> 00:10:07.470 align:middle line:84%
We thank you for allowing
us in this co-creation

00:10:07.470 --> 00:10:10.920 align:middle line:84%
to share this idea of the
connection of two worlds,

00:10:10.920 --> 00:10:15.130 align:middle line:84%
physical and non-physical, in
this endeavor of open contact.

00:10:15.130 --> 00:10:19.500 align:middle line:84%
And we encourage you to
accelerate this activity as you

00:10:19.500 --> 00:10:21.480 align:middle line:90%
go forward in your lives.

00:10:21.480 --> 00:10:25.470 align:middle line:84%
And in return, for the gift
you are giving our civilization

00:10:25.470 --> 00:10:27.960 align:middle line:84%
for interacting
with all of you, I

00:10:27.960 --> 00:10:30.570 align:middle line:84%
ask now, in what
way may we continue

00:10:30.570 --> 00:10:32.230 align:middle line:90%
to be of service to you?

00:10:32.230 --> 00:10:36.540 align:middle line:84%
Please begin with your process
of dialogues and questions,

00:10:36.540 --> 00:10:38.340 align:middle line:90%
if you wish.

00:10:38.340 --> 00:10:45.470 align:middle line:84%
>> I ask on behalf of this
community and the world the one

00:10:45.470 --> 00:10:47.070 align:middle line:90%
question.

00:10:47.070 --> 00:10:51.920 align:middle line:90%
Do we have a date for contact?

00:10:51.920 --> 00:10:55.840 align:middle line:84%
>> There are stages to
the idea of open contact,

00:10:55.840 --> 00:10:59.260 align:middle line:84%
especially because of the
compartmentalization of many

00:10:59.260 --> 00:11:02.590 align:middle line:84%
of the consciousnesses on your
planet and the rate at which you

00:11:02.590 --> 00:11:05.000 align:middle line:84%
are all willing to
integrate yourselves.

00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:07.005 align:middle line:84%
So the idea is that
there will be phases,

00:11:07.005 --> 00:11:08.380 align:middle line:84%
there will be
markers, there will

00:11:08.380 --> 00:11:13.040 align:middle line:84%
be things that will happen
in steps to get you used

00:11:13.040 --> 00:11:16.970 align:middle line:84%
to the idea as you yourself
uplift your vibration

00:11:16.970 --> 00:11:18.890 align:middle line:90%
and are ready for more.

00:11:18.890 --> 00:11:21.230 align:middle line:84%
As we said, many people
believe that they're ready,

00:11:21.230 --> 00:11:24.320 align:middle line:84%
but they're still thinking
about the idea as taking place

00:11:24.320 --> 00:11:25.970 align:middle line:90%
on a physical level.

00:11:25.970 --> 00:11:28.520 align:middle line:84%
When, in fact, exposure
to our vibration

00:11:28.520 --> 00:11:32.060 align:middle line:84%
actually kicks their survival
mechanism physically into play

00:11:32.060 --> 00:11:35.090 align:middle line:84%
and makes them feel like
they're dying in our presence.

00:11:35.090 --> 00:11:38.540 align:middle line:84%
So the idea is you have to
wait until the vibration is

00:11:38.540 --> 00:11:43.160 align:middle line:84%
high enough that you will not
react that way to our presence.

00:11:43.160 --> 00:11:46.300 align:middle line:84%
Now, there are several
things that can happen.

00:11:46.300 --> 00:11:49.760 align:middle line:84%
One of them is that somewhere
around the timing, as we read

00:11:49.760 --> 00:11:53.900 align:middle line:84%
the energy now of the
end of your year of 2026

00:11:53.900 --> 00:11:56.120 align:middle line:84%
and the beginning of
your year of 2027,

00:11:56.120 --> 00:11:59.150 align:middle line:84%
there may be an event
that will allow people

00:11:59.150 --> 00:12:02.960 align:middle line:84%
on your planet to recognize
that extraterrestrials truly

00:12:02.960 --> 00:12:03.950 align:middle line:90%
do exist.

00:12:03.950 --> 00:12:06.920 align:middle line:84%
And it will give you an
opportunity to really consider

00:12:06.920 --> 00:12:09.060 align:middle line:90%
what path you wish to walk.

00:12:09.060 --> 00:12:12.490 align:middle line:84%
It will not be a full-blown
open contact, but it will lead.

00:12:12.490 --> 00:12:13.740 align:middle line:90%
It will be the precursor.

00:12:13.740 --> 00:12:15.420 align:middle line:84%
It will be one of
the events that

00:12:15.420 --> 00:12:17.820 align:middle line:84%
will allow you to know it
is very important for you

00:12:17.820 --> 00:12:21.060 align:middle line:84%
to make a decision,
to make a choice as

00:12:21.060 --> 00:12:22.920 align:middle line:90%
to what path you wish to walk.

00:12:22.920 --> 00:12:25.290 align:middle line:84%
And so it is up to
you, at that time,

00:12:25.290 --> 00:12:29.220 align:middle line:84%
to take in that event, however
it presents itself to you,

00:12:29.220 --> 00:12:31.230 align:middle line:84%
and make a decision
and make sure

00:12:31.230 --> 00:12:33.180 align:middle line:84%
all your actions
are commensurate

00:12:33.180 --> 00:12:36.660 align:middle line:84%
and in alignment with the idea
of the integrity of walking

00:12:36.660 --> 00:12:38.070 align:middle line:90%
the spiritual path.

00:12:38.070 --> 00:12:40.110 align:middle line:84%
And there will be
other kinds of events

00:12:40.110 --> 00:12:41.530 align:middle line:90%
that will take place as well.

00:12:41.530 --> 00:12:45.870 align:middle line:84%
However, the all-encompassing
window of open contact

00:12:45.870 --> 00:12:48.720 align:middle line:84%
is between your
present year of 2023

00:12:48.720 --> 00:12:51.430 align:middle line:90%
and your year of 2033 to 2040.

00:12:51.430 --> 00:12:57.373 align:middle line:84%
Within that window, open
contact is 90% likely to happen.

00:12:57.373 --> 00:12:58.665 align:middle line:90%
Does that answer your question?

00:12:58.665 --> 00:12:59.740 align:middle line:90%
>> No, it doesn't.

00:12:59.740 --> 00:13:00.970 align:middle line:90%
Can we narrow it down?

00:13:00.970 --> 00:13:04.679 align:middle line:90%


00:13:04.679 --> 00:13:05.653 align:middle line:90%
>> No.

00:13:05.653 --> 00:13:08.810 align:middle line:90%


00:13:08.810 --> 00:13:11.160 align:middle line:84%
There are many
things still in flux.

00:13:11.160 --> 00:13:13.530 align:middle line:84%
Many decisions have
yet to be made.

00:13:13.530 --> 00:13:17.990 align:middle line:84%
Therefore, the window, as
seemingly vague as it may be,

00:13:17.990 --> 00:13:21.790 align:middle line:90%
is actually in control by you.

00:13:21.790 --> 00:13:23.690 align:middle line:90%
It's actually in your hands.

00:13:23.690 --> 00:13:26.020 align:middle line:84%
We're just reading
what we're reading.

00:13:26.020 --> 00:13:28.240 align:middle line:84%
We're not necessarily
determining it.

00:13:28.240 --> 00:13:30.270 align:middle line:90%
You are.

00:13:30.270 --> 00:13:31.860 align:middle line:90%
Does that answer your question?

00:13:31.860 --> 00:13:35.430 align:middle line:90%
>> Kind of.

00:13:35.430 --> 00:13:38.670 align:middle line:84%
But you mentioned
multiple things

00:13:38.670 --> 00:13:40.620 align:middle line:90%
going on at the same time.

00:13:40.620 --> 00:13:43.710 align:middle line:84%
That would suggest
that we're talking

00:13:43.710 --> 00:13:46.230 align:middle line:90%
about multiple locations.

00:13:46.230 --> 00:13:48.480 align:middle line:84%
Is there a country
involved or are

00:13:48.480 --> 00:13:50.350 align:middle line:90%
these cities around the world?

00:13:50.350 --> 00:13:52.890 align:middle line:84%
And if it does happen
that way, will it

00:13:52.890 --> 00:13:54.665 align:middle line:90%
happen all at the same time?

00:13:54.665 --> 00:13:56.010 align:middle line:90%
>> No.

00:13:56.010 --> 00:13:58.570 align:middle line:10%
It will happen, as
I said, in phases.

00:13:58.570 --> 00:14:02.370 align:middle line:84%
And also, please remember, when
we talked about open contact,

00:14:02.370 --> 00:14:05.910 align:middle line:84%
it's open contact with every
form of life on your planet, not

00:14:05.910 --> 00:14:08.280 align:middle line:90%
just humans.

00:14:08.280 --> 00:14:11.340 align:middle line:84%
There's a lot of consciousness,
a lot of sentience,

00:14:11.340 --> 00:14:14.100 align:middle line:84%
a lot of awareness,
a lot of energy,

00:14:14.100 --> 00:14:16.660 align:middle line:90%
a lot of beings on your planet.

00:14:16.660 --> 00:14:19.970 align:middle line:84%
Open contact will happen
with many of them as well.

00:14:19.970 --> 00:14:24.210 align:middle line:84%
Now, the irony is that for
many indigenous cultures

00:14:24.210 --> 00:14:27.250 align:middle line:84%
on your planet, open contact
has been going on for hundreds

00:14:27.250 --> 00:14:29.970 align:middle line:90%
and thousands of years.

00:14:29.970 --> 00:14:31.210 align:middle line:90%
Because they're used to it.

00:14:31.210 --> 00:14:32.760 align:middle line:84%
It's their law,
it's their culture

00:14:32.760 --> 00:14:35.460 align:middle line:84%
to understand their
connections to the stars

00:14:35.460 --> 00:14:37.060 align:middle line:90%
and their ancestors.

00:14:37.060 --> 00:14:39.990 align:middle line:84%
So the idea is
that there's really

00:14:39.990 --> 00:14:43.470 align:middle line:84%
open contact that is going
on, and it's something

00:14:43.470 --> 00:14:46.650 align:middle line:84%
that other cultures on your
planet have to get used to,

00:14:46.650 --> 00:14:49.260 align:middle line:84%
have to be open, to
have to be aware of

00:14:49.260 --> 00:14:53.440 align:middle line:84%
and allow it to bleed into
their cultures as well.

00:14:53.440 --> 00:14:55.890 align:middle line:84%
So in a sense, the
answer to your question

00:14:55.890 --> 00:14:58.810 align:middle line:84%
is, it's been happening
for thousands of years.

00:14:58.810 --> 00:15:01.950 align:middle line:90%
You have never been alone.

00:15:01.950 --> 00:15:03.610 align:middle line:90%
Does that answer your question?

00:15:03.610 --> 00:15:05.020 align:middle line:90%
>> Thank you for that.

00:15:05.020 --> 00:15:08.910 align:middle line:84%
I just have one
follow-up, and that--

00:15:08.910 --> 00:15:13.080 align:middle line:84%
and thank you for putting up
with me, Bashar, seriously--

00:15:13.080 --> 00:15:16.680 align:middle line:84%
is this, what about
our family, our

00:15:16.680 --> 00:15:21.010 align:middle line:84%
loved ones, our brothers and
sisters and those around us?

00:15:21.010 --> 00:15:24.240 align:middle line:84%
How do we communicate
to them that this

00:15:24.240 --> 00:15:27.090 align:middle line:84%
is going to happen
without freaking out those

00:15:27.090 --> 00:15:28.905 align:middle line:90%
that are the closest to us?

00:15:28.905 --> 00:15:32.490 align:middle line:84%
>> Those that wish to freak
out, as you say, will freak out.

00:15:32.490 --> 00:15:34.690 align:middle line:90%
Those that will not, will not.

00:15:34.690 --> 00:15:37.150 align:middle line:84%
You cannot really do
anything about it.

00:15:37.150 --> 00:15:40.770 align:middle line:84%
All you can do is share your
idea of what may happen,

00:15:40.770 --> 00:15:43.980 align:middle line:84%
see if they are vibrationally
compatible and willing to open

00:15:43.980 --> 00:15:45.250 align:middle line:90%
up to that idea.

00:15:45.250 --> 00:15:47.830 align:middle line:84%
But remember, you
don't know their path.

00:15:47.830 --> 00:15:51.160 align:middle line:84%
They may need to experience
things in a very different way.

00:15:51.160 --> 00:15:54.010 align:middle line:84%
So all you can do is
share the information.

00:15:54.010 --> 00:15:55.890 align:middle line:84%
And what they do
with that information

00:15:55.890 --> 00:15:58.770 align:middle line:90%
is none of your business.

00:15:58.770 --> 00:16:02.520 align:middle line:84%
Remember, you never change
the planet that you're on.

00:16:02.520 --> 00:16:05.430 align:middle line:84%
There already exists
simultaneously

00:16:05.430 --> 00:16:10.890 align:middle line:84%
any number of parallel reality
versions of earth, many of which

00:16:10.890 --> 00:16:13.750 align:middle line:84%
are already experiencing
global contact.

00:16:13.750 --> 00:16:17.160 align:middle line:84%
So when you change yourself
and change your vibration,

00:16:17.160 --> 00:16:20.070 align:middle line:84%
you're actually shifting
yourself billions of times

00:16:20.070 --> 00:16:24.090 align:middle line:84%
a second through a series
of parallel reality versions

00:16:24.090 --> 00:16:26.190 align:middle line:84%
of Earth that are
more and more and more

00:16:26.190 --> 00:16:30.280 align:middle line:84%
reflective of open
contact already existing.

00:16:30.280 --> 00:16:32.280 align:middle line:84%
Other people may not
choose that path.

00:16:32.280 --> 00:16:35.130 align:middle line:84%
They may navigate themselves
to other versions of Earth

00:16:35.130 --> 00:16:38.100 align:middle line:84%
where open contact
doesn't happen ever.

00:16:38.100 --> 00:16:41.520 align:middle line:84%
So the idea is you have to let
everyone decide what path they

00:16:41.520 --> 00:16:43.560 align:middle line:84%
wish to walk, what
they believe is

00:16:43.560 --> 00:16:45.660 align:middle line:84%
the process they
need to experience,

00:16:45.660 --> 00:16:47.310 align:middle line:90%
and leave it up to them.

00:16:47.310 --> 00:16:50.730 align:middle line:84%
Because you will simply be
interacting with whatever people

00:16:50.730 --> 00:16:53.370 align:middle line:84%
inhabit that version of
Earth that are at least

00:16:53.370 --> 00:16:55.230 align:middle line:84%
somewhat vibrationally
compatible

00:16:55.230 --> 00:16:57.700 align:middle line:84%
to what you have
chosen to experience.

00:16:57.700 --> 00:16:59.335 align:middle line:90%
Does that make sense?

00:16:59.335 --> 00:17:03.245 align:middle line:84%
>> For our community and the
world, we thank you, Bashar.

00:17:03.245 --> 00:17:04.045 align:middle line:90%
Thank you so much.

00:17:04.045 --> 00:17:05.699 align:middle line:84%
>> It is our passion
and our pleasure.

00:17:05.699 --> 00:17:08.816 align:middle line:90%
[APPLAUSE AND CHEERING]

00:17:08.816 --> 00:17:11.616 align:middle line:90%


00:17:11.616 --> 00:17:12.770 align:middle line:90%
>> Hello, Bashar.

00:17:12.770 --> 00:17:13.909 align:middle line:90%
>> And to you, good day.

00:17:13.909 --> 00:17:15.869 align:middle line:90%
>> Good to see you again.

00:17:15.869 --> 00:17:19.020 align:middle line:10%
I think this is one of the
most important addresses you

00:17:19.020 --> 00:17:22.680 align:middle line:10%
can bring up, the fact that
these two worlds are merging now

00:17:22.680 --> 00:17:26.670 align:middle line:10%
and the fact that people are
in so much fear about contact.

00:17:26.670 --> 00:17:28.140 align:middle line:84%
I think you're
suggesting we have

00:17:28.140 --> 00:17:31.110 align:middle line:84%
to let go of the old
identities of being human

00:17:31.110 --> 00:17:36.020 align:middle line:84%
and come into a more lucid,
a more transcendental place

00:17:36.020 --> 00:17:36.820 align:middle line:90%
of being.

00:17:36.820 --> 00:17:37.620 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:17:37.620 --> 00:17:39.480 align:middle line:84%
The real question
is, and again, we

00:17:39.480 --> 00:17:42.000 align:middle line:84%
don't mean this in a
negative or scary way,

00:17:42.000 --> 00:17:44.400 align:middle line:90%
are you prepared to die?

00:17:44.400 --> 00:17:45.790 align:middle line:90%
>> What does that mean?

00:17:45.790 --> 00:17:49.140 align:middle line:84%
>> Your consciousness has to
change in such a way that you

00:17:49.140 --> 00:17:52.680 align:middle line:84%
allow yourself not to see such
a difference between the idea

00:17:52.680 --> 00:17:55.890 align:middle line:84%
of physical reality and
non-physical reality.

00:17:55.890 --> 00:17:58.120 align:middle line:90%
It isn't an afterlife.

00:17:58.120 --> 00:18:00.820 align:middle line:90%
It's just life continuing.

00:18:00.820 --> 00:18:02.140 align:middle line:90%
It's a continuum.

00:18:02.140 --> 00:18:05.340 align:middle line:84%
And when you understand that
physical reality is just as

00:18:05.340 --> 00:18:08.160 align:middle line:84%
spiritual, is just an
extension of consciousness,

00:18:08.160 --> 00:18:11.830 align:middle line:84%
a projection of consciousness
that you're actually dreaming

00:18:11.830 --> 00:18:16.340 align:middle line:84%
right now, that all of you
exist right now in spirit,

00:18:16.340 --> 00:18:19.700 align:middle line:84%
you never leave spirit,
that's your natural state.

00:18:19.700 --> 00:18:22.640 align:middle line:84%
You are pretending
not to be in spirit.

00:18:22.640 --> 00:18:25.000 align:middle line:84%
Physical reality
is a dream you're

00:18:25.000 --> 00:18:29.420 align:middle line:84%
having in spirit of pretending
that you're not in spirit.

00:18:29.420 --> 00:18:31.930 align:middle line:84%
When you really start to
understand that and wrap

00:18:31.930 --> 00:18:36.020 align:middle line:84%
your minds around that, you
will not fear the idea of death.

00:18:36.020 --> 00:18:38.230 align:middle line:84%
You will be prepared
to transition

00:18:38.230 --> 00:18:40.210 align:middle line:84%
because the idea is
there really will

00:18:40.210 --> 00:18:43.790 align:middle line:84%
be not much difference between
the idea of physical reality

00:18:43.790 --> 00:18:46.220 align:middle line:84%
and the idea of
non-physical reality.

00:18:46.220 --> 00:18:47.560 align:middle line:90%
The two will blend.

00:18:47.560 --> 00:18:50.410 align:middle line:84%
And it will be like
ultimately, in your evolution,

00:18:50.410 --> 00:18:53.980 align:middle line:84%
the way we experience reality,
like you are constantly

00:18:53.980 --> 00:18:55.880 align:middle line:90%
walking through a dream.

00:18:55.880 --> 00:18:59.525 align:middle line:84%
>> Is there a practice you can
recommend to cultivate this

00:18:59.525 --> 00:19:00.325 align:middle line:90%
lucidity.

00:19:00.325 --> 00:19:04.160 align:middle line:84%
>> Follow the formula we
have shared with all of you.

00:19:04.160 --> 00:19:07.942 align:middle line:84%
>> Can you repeat it for
people who might be new to it?

00:19:07.942 --> 00:19:10.270 align:middle line:90%
>> Act on your passion.

00:19:10.270 --> 00:19:12.400 align:middle line:84%
Act on it as much as
you can, taking it

00:19:12.400 --> 00:19:15.940 align:middle line:84%
as far as you can until you
can act on it no longer.

00:19:15.940 --> 00:19:18.400 align:middle line:84%
Act on your passion
with absolutely zero

00:19:18.400 --> 00:19:21.580 align:middle line:84%
assumption, zero insistence on
what the outcome should look

00:19:21.580 --> 00:19:22.630 align:middle line:90%
like.

00:19:22.630 --> 00:19:25.870 align:middle line:84%
Stay in a positive state, no
matter what manifests, in order

00:19:25.870 --> 00:19:27.520 align:middle line:90%
to get the benefit out of it.

00:19:27.520 --> 00:19:30.760 align:middle line:84%
And examine your belief
systems and constantly let

00:19:30.760 --> 00:19:33.010 align:middle line:84%
go of the ones that are
fear-based and negative

00:19:33.010 --> 00:19:34.780 align:middle line:84%
that don't serve
you and don't align

00:19:34.780 --> 00:19:37.460 align:middle line:84%
with your core
essential vibration.

00:19:37.460 --> 00:19:40.720 align:middle line:84%
When you do that, it's like
literally an instruction

00:19:40.720 --> 00:19:44.230 align:middle line:84%
manual for how you create
your reality more consciously.

00:19:44.230 --> 00:19:47.380 align:middle line:84%
And it will actually act
as a navigational tool that

00:19:47.380 --> 00:19:49.450 align:middle line:84%
will constantly
allow you to navigate

00:19:49.450 --> 00:19:53.050 align:middle line:84%
in the direction of more
and more and more positive

00:19:53.050 --> 00:19:54.130 align:middle line:90%
versions of Earth.

00:19:54.130 --> 00:19:57.860 align:middle line:84%
Because you're already shifting
from one reality to another.

00:19:57.860 --> 00:20:00.310 align:middle line:84%
Literally-- this is not
a metaphor-- literally

00:20:00.310 --> 00:20:03.680 align:middle line:84%
shifting billions
of times per second.

00:20:03.680 --> 00:20:07.270 align:middle line:84%
That's how you create the side
effect called space, time,

00:20:07.270 --> 00:20:08.450 align:middle line:90%
and change.

00:20:08.450 --> 00:20:11.620 align:middle line:84%
It's like having frames of
film that your consciousness is

00:20:11.620 --> 00:20:14.890 align:middle line:84%
shifting through like a
projector light and the frames

00:20:14.890 --> 00:20:17.350 align:middle line:84%
that you filter
through determines

00:20:17.350 --> 00:20:19.750 align:middle line:84%
the timeline in the way
that you experience it

00:20:19.750 --> 00:20:21.340 align:middle line:90%
in physical reality.

00:20:21.340 --> 00:20:23.710 align:middle line:84%
So since you are
already shifting,

00:20:23.710 --> 00:20:25.720 align:middle line:84%
you might as well
shift in the direction

00:20:25.720 --> 00:20:28.240 align:middle line:84%
that you feel gives you
an advantage that you feel

00:20:28.240 --> 00:20:31.060 align:middle line:84%
is positive, creative, and
loving, because it's really

00:20:31.060 --> 00:20:32.140 align:middle line:90%
your choice to do so.

00:20:32.140 --> 00:20:34.130 align:middle line:84%
Because you can't
help but shift,

00:20:34.130 --> 00:20:35.480 align:middle line:90%
that's your natural state.

00:20:35.480 --> 00:20:39.230 align:middle line:84%
It's how you're generating the
experience of physical reality.

00:20:39.230 --> 00:20:42.370 align:middle line:84%
So shift in the direction
you prefer, and we give you

00:20:42.370 --> 00:20:44.560 align:middle line:84%
the formula that makes
it easy to do that

00:20:44.560 --> 00:20:46.570 align:middle line:84%
so that you don't have
to overcomplicate it

00:20:46.570 --> 00:20:47.510 align:middle line:90%
and overthink it.

00:20:47.510 --> 00:20:50.740 align:middle line:84%
It's literally a distillation
of how you literally

00:20:50.740 --> 00:20:53.210 align:middle line:84%
create your physical
reality experience.

00:20:53.210 --> 00:20:54.940 align:middle line:84%
So just follow it
like an instruction

00:20:54.940 --> 00:20:57.310 align:middle line:84%
manual, like you would
follow any instruction

00:20:57.310 --> 00:21:00.260 align:middle line:84%
manual to operate a piece
of machinery on your planet.

00:21:00.260 --> 00:21:03.420 align:middle line:84%
Don't add any instructions,
don't leave any instructions

00:21:03.420 --> 00:21:04.220 align:middle line:90%
out.

00:21:04.220 --> 00:21:06.170 align:middle line:90%
Just follow the instructions.

00:21:06.170 --> 00:21:08.560 align:middle line:84%
The machine, not meaning
it to sound cold,

00:21:08.560 --> 00:21:10.400 align:middle line:90%
will then work as advertised.

00:21:10.400 --> 00:21:12.310 align:middle line:84%
If you don't follow
the instructions,

00:21:12.310 --> 00:21:15.790 align:middle line:84%
the machine may work, but you
may not go in the direction

00:21:15.790 --> 00:21:16.880 align:middle line:90%
that you prefer.

00:21:16.880 --> 00:21:17.990 align:middle line:90%
Does this help you?

00:21:17.990 --> 00:21:18.790 align:middle line:90%
>> Absolutely.

00:21:18.790 --> 00:21:19.930 align:middle line:90%
Just one more comment.

00:21:19.930 --> 00:21:22.390 align:middle line:84%
The whole conversation about
near-death experiences,

00:21:22.390 --> 00:21:24.280 align:middle line:84%
out-of-body remote
viewing, this seems

00:21:24.280 --> 00:21:27.310 align:middle line:84%
to be leaning towards
what you're stating here,

00:21:27.310 --> 00:21:29.630 align:middle line:84%
this transcendental
awareness of this.

00:21:29.630 --> 00:21:30.430 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:21:30.430 --> 00:21:33.100 align:middle line:84%
Why do you think you're having
more experiences that you're

00:21:33.100 --> 00:21:35.000 align:middle line:90%
calling near-death experiences?

00:21:35.000 --> 00:21:37.820 align:middle line:84%
Why do you think you're having
more reports of those things?

00:21:37.820 --> 00:21:40.300 align:middle line:84%
It's to get you to
understand the continuum

00:21:40.300 --> 00:21:42.550 align:middle line:84%
and that there really
isn't that much difference

00:21:42.550 --> 00:21:44.950 align:middle line:84%
between physical and
non-physical reality

00:21:44.950 --> 00:21:47.500 align:middle line:84%
except the differences you
make in your belief systems

00:21:47.500 --> 00:21:48.300 align:middle line:90%
and definitions.

00:21:48.300 --> 00:21:50.395 align:middle line:84%
>> Thank you so
much for being here.

00:21:50.395 --> 00:21:51.195 align:middle line:90%
>> Thank you.

00:21:51.195 --> 00:21:54.470 align:middle line:90%
[APPLAUSE]

00:21:54.470 --> 00:21:56.450 align:middle line:90%


00:21:56.450 --> 00:21:57.515 align:middle line:90%
>> Hello, Bashar.

00:21:57.515 --> 00:21:59.822 align:middle line:90%
>> And you, good day.

00:21:59.822 --> 00:22:04.510 align:middle line:84%
>> So on my birthday,
July 30th, 2019,

00:22:04.510 --> 00:22:09.070 align:middle line:84%
my partner Cody and I were in
the desert and we had three

00:22:09.070 --> 00:22:13.090 align:middle line:84%
tall, thin blue beings that
looked like what we consider

00:22:13.090 --> 00:22:13.960 align:middle line:90%
ETs.

00:22:13.960 --> 00:22:18.790 align:middle line:84%
They were wearing robes and they
appeared to us in the desert.

00:22:18.790 --> 00:22:23.650 align:middle line:84%
A little while later, they came
back to me and called themselves

00:22:23.650 --> 00:22:25.710 align:middle line:90%
"we the three."

00:22:25.710 --> 00:22:30.420 align:middle line:84%
And then again change their form
and said that they were not ETs,

00:22:30.420 --> 00:22:33.060 align:middle line:84%
but they were great
ancient beings.

00:22:33.060 --> 00:22:35.070 align:middle line:84%
And I wanted to know
if you could tell me

00:22:35.070 --> 00:22:37.290 align:middle line:84%
any information
about this spirit.

00:22:37.290 --> 00:22:40.140 align:middle line:84%
>> As you expand
your consciousness,

00:22:40.140 --> 00:22:43.110 align:middle line:84%
you will allow your
senses to expand,

00:22:43.110 --> 00:22:45.610 align:middle line:84%
to be able to pick up on things
that have been around all

00:22:45.610 --> 00:22:46.410 align:middle line:90%
the time.

00:22:46.410 --> 00:22:48.950 align:middle line:90%
Remember, time is your illusion.

00:22:48.950 --> 00:22:51.910 align:middle line:90%
Everything exists here and now.

00:22:51.910 --> 00:22:53.640 align:middle line:84%
So many people
are going to begin

00:22:53.640 --> 00:22:55.740 align:middle line:84%
to experience things
of ancientness

00:22:55.740 --> 00:22:58.530 align:middle line:84%
that they call in the
past, but those things

00:22:58.530 --> 00:23:00.730 align:middle line:90%
exist simultaneously with you.

00:23:00.730 --> 00:23:03.060 align:middle line:84%
You just happen to be
on the correct vibration

00:23:03.060 --> 00:23:05.760 align:middle line:84%
to be able to start
perceiving beings that

00:23:05.760 --> 00:23:09.240 align:middle line:84%
have been on your planet
for a long time around you

00:23:09.240 --> 00:23:11.460 align:middle line:84%
all the time that have
simply been heretofore

00:23:11.460 --> 00:23:13.170 align:middle line:90%
invisible to you.

00:23:13.170 --> 00:23:16.050 align:middle line:84%
Understand there have been many
civilizations on your planet

00:23:16.050 --> 00:23:18.630 align:middle line:90%
before humanity ever came along.

00:23:18.630 --> 00:23:21.900 align:middle line:84%
So you're beginning to see
some of the other cultures that

00:23:21.900 --> 00:23:23.590 align:middle line:90%
exist alongside of you.

00:23:23.590 --> 00:23:25.960 align:middle line:84%
But many of them,
understand, that you actually

00:23:25.960 --> 00:23:29.200 align:middle line:84%
coexist simultaneously
in different phases,

00:23:29.200 --> 00:23:32.090 align:middle line:84%
different vibrational
states of the Earth.

00:23:32.090 --> 00:23:33.910 align:middle line:84%
So you've opened
the doorway to being

00:23:33.910 --> 00:23:37.210 align:middle line:84%
able to experience an
interaction with beings that

00:23:37.210 --> 00:23:40.750 align:middle line:84%
are representative of a very
ancient culture on your planet

00:23:40.750 --> 00:23:43.460 align:middle line:84%
that your history tells
you nothing about.

00:23:43.460 --> 00:23:45.410 align:middle line:90%
>> Thank you so much.

00:23:45.410 --> 00:23:48.050 align:middle line:84%
>> You are so welcome, but
I had nothing to do with it.

00:23:48.050 --> 00:23:53.110 align:middle line:90%


00:23:53.110 --> 00:23:54.130 align:middle line:90%
>> Hello, Bashar.

00:23:54.130 --> 00:23:56.000 align:middle line:90%
>> And to you, good day.

00:23:56.000 --> 00:23:57.960 align:middle line:84%
>> Thank you so
much for being here.

00:23:57.960 --> 00:24:01.740 align:middle line:84%
You talked about the many
layers to the physical reality

00:24:01.740 --> 00:24:06.190 align:middle line:84%
that we would go through
in raising our vibration.

00:24:06.190 --> 00:24:09.040 align:middle line:84%
What are some clues
that would help us along

00:24:09.040 --> 00:24:14.682 align:middle line:84%
in understanding that
we're doing it correctly?

00:24:14.682 --> 00:24:17.790 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, if again, you have a
deep understanding of following

00:24:17.790 --> 00:24:20.760 align:middle line:84%
the formula very
precisely, again,

00:24:20.760 --> 00:24:25.140 align:middle line:84%
your senses will allow you to
perceive things that will give

00:24:25.140 --> 00:24:29.063 align:middle line:84%
you the signs that you need to
understand about the direction

00:24:29.063 --> 00:24:29.980 align:middle line:90%
in which you're going.

00:24:29.980 --> 00:24:34.500 align:middle line:84%
Plus, remember, synchronicity
will increase, and accelerate,

00:24:34.500 --> 00:24:38.190 align:middle line:84%
and bring you situations, and
circumstances, and opportunities

00:24:38.190 --> 00:24:41.640 align:middle line:84%
to act on that will be
representative of the expansion

00:24:41.640 --> 00:24:43.690 align:middle line:90%
that you are now experiencing.

00:24:43.690 --> 00:24:47.610 align:middle line:84%
It will bring you something
on the level, the new level

00:24:47.610 --> 00:24:50.460 align:middle line:84%
on which you can handle
new things, on which you

00:24:50.460 --> 00:24:52.120 align:middle line:90%
can perceive new things.

00:24:52.120 --> 00:24:55.050 align:middle line:84%
Synchronicity is the
automatic organizing principle

00:24:55.050 --> 00:24:55.970 align:middle line:90%
of your life.

00:24:55.970 --> 00:24:58.990 align:middle line:84%
It's built in to the
structure of existence.

00:24:58.990 --> 00:25:02.130 align:middle line:84%
And when you expand your
consciousness in a certain way,

00:25:02.130 --> 00:25:03.690 align:middle line:84%
then you will get
the reflections

00:25:03.690 --> 00:25:07.050 align:middle line:84%
from synchronicity of the
opportunities, circumstances,

00:25:07.050 --> 00:25:10.410 align:middle line:84%
and situations that are
germane and in alignment

00:25:10.410 --> 00:25:12.190 align:middle line:90%
with the level that you're on.

00:25:12.190 --> 00:25:14.200 align:middle line:84%
So they will be your
signs that you're

00:25:14.200 --> 00:25:15.890 align:middle line:90%
moving in a certain direction.

00:25:15.890 --> 00:25:16.800 align:middle line:90%
Does that make sense?

00:25:16.800 --> 00:25:17.720 align:middle line:90%
>> It does.

00:25:17.720 --> 00:25:20.880 align:middle line:10%
So we're like building on our
experiences as we go along?

00:25:20.880 --> 00:25:22.060 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:25:22.060 --> 00:25:25.180 align:middle line:84%
Because the experiences will be
something bigger than you could

00:25:25.180 --> 00:25:26.090 align:middle line:90%
perceive before.

00:25:26.090 --> 00:25:28.600 align:middle line:90%
Remember, this is just physics.

00:25:28.600 --> 00:25:31.960 align:middle line:84%
You can only perceive what you
are the vibrational level of.

00:25:31.960 --> 00:25:36.240 align:middle line:84%
You cannot perceive what you're
not the vibrational level of.

00:25:36.240 --> 00:25:39.670 align:middle line:84%
So the idea is that certain
opportunities are not

00:25:39.670 --> 00:25:41.740 align:middle line:84%
even visible to
you, will not even

00:25:41.740 --> 00:25:45.310 align:middle line:84%
be something you would imagine
unless you're actually already

00:25:45.310 --> 00:25:47.480 align:middle line:90%
on a certain frequency level.

00:25:47.480 --> 00:25:50.830 align:middle line:84%
So suddenly, being inspired
by certain opportunities,

00:25:50.830 --> 00:25:53.380 align:middle line:84%
certain situations,
certain actions you

00:25:53.380 --> 00:25:56.080 align:middle line:84%
can take in a direction
of inspiration

00:25:56.080 --> 00:25:58.180 align:middle line:84%
that you didn't
think of before are

00:25:58.180 --> 00:26:01.940 align:middle line:84%
representative of you being
on the level of that thing.

00:26:01.940 --> 00:26:02.740 align:middle line:90%
Do you understand?

00:26:02.740 --> 00:26:03.790 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes, I do.

00:26:03.790 --> 00:26:04.590 align:middle line:90%
Thank you so much.

00:26:04.590 --> 00:26:08.780 align:middle line:84%
>> It is self-reflective,
self-guiding, self-expansive.

00:26:08.780 --> 00:26:11.340 align:middle line:84%
That's why you don't have to
overthink it or over complicate

00:26:11.340 --> 00:26:12.140 align:middle line:90%
it.

00:26:12.140 --> 00:26:15.830 align:middle line:84%
The guidance mechanism
is built into the formula

00:26:15.830 --> 00:26:18.520 align:middle line:84%
if you just simply
understand it and use it

00:26:18.520 --> 00:26:20.870 align:middle line:90%
as precisely as possible.

00:26:20.870 --> 00:26:21.670 align:middle line:90%
>> Great.

00:26:21.670 --> 00:26:22.550 align:middle line:90%
Thank you so much.

00:26:22.550 --> 00:26:23.467 align:middle line:90%
>> You are so welcome.

00:26:23.467 --> 00:26:28.320 align:middle line:90%


00:26:28.320 --> 00:26:31.052 align:middle line:90%
>> So I just have one question.

00:26:31.052 --> 00:26:32.010 align:middle line:90%
>> Well, wait a minute.

00:26:32.010 --> 00:26:33.510 align:middle line:84%
What happened to
hello and good day?

00:26:33.510 --> 00:26:36.352 align:middle line:90%


00:26:36.352 --> 00:26:37.760 align:middle line:90%
>> Hello.

00:26:37.760 --> 00:26:39.720 align:middle line:90%
Good day.

00:26:39.720 --> 00:26:42.270 align:middle line:90%
>> What is your question?

00:26:42.270 --> 00:26:48.420 align:middle line:84%
>> There is a constant message
that comes through that

00:26:48.420 --> 00:26:54.640 align:middle line:84%
everything is nothing and
nothing is everything.

00:26:54.640 --> 00:27:00.340 align:middle line:90%
And it just feels so good.

00:27:00.340 --> 00:27:02.460 align:middle line:90%
More than good.

00:27:02.460 --> 00:27:11.231 align:middle line:84%
How is that related to the
interaction with other beings?

00:27:11.231 --> 00:27:15.610 align:middle line:84%
>> Everything is a reflection
of everything else.

00:27:15.610 --> 00:27:19.810 align:middle line:84%
If you want to say it on
the simplest possible level,

00:27:19.810 --> 00:27:23.110 align:middle line:90%
you can say, well, what are you?

00:27:23.110 --> 00:27:24.150 align:middle line:90%
What am I?

00:27:24.150 --> 00:27:29.500 align:middle line:84%
The answer to that is, I am
you, from another point of view.

00:27:29.500 --> 00:27:33.640 align:middle line:84%
There is only one thing,
and all the different things

00:27:33.640 --> 00:27:36.010 align:middle line:84%
that appear to be different
are different reflections

00:27:36.010 --> 00:27:38.510 align:middle line:90%
of that one thing.

00:27:38.510 --> 00:27:44.540 align:middle line:84%
But in every one is
the seed of everything.

00:27:44.540 --> 00:27:48.230 align:middle line:84%
The idea of nothingness
is a concept,

00:27:48.230 --> 00:27:52.610 align:middle line:84%
but it's not really
emptiness in that sense.

00:27:52.610 --> 00:27:57.110 align:middle line:84%
It's simply that everything
is equal in its reflectivity

00:27:57.110 --> 00:28:00.890 align:middle line:84%
as being a reflection, an
equal reflection, of the one,

00:28:00.890 --> 00:28:02.960 align:middle line:90%
of all that is.

00:28:02.960 --> 00:28:04.680 align:middle line:90%
Is this making some sense?

00:28:04.680 --> 00:28:07.730 align:middle line:90%
>> It's making perfect sense.

00:28:07.730 --> 00:28:11.650 align:middle line:90%
It's exactly what I feel.

00:28:11.650 --> 00:28:19.560 align:middle line:84%
How does it relate
outside of that feeling?

00:28:19.560 --> 00:28:20.360 align:middle line:90%
Or does it?

00:28:20.360 --> 00:28:25.025 align:middle line:90%
Or that is that it?

00:28:25.025 --> 00:28:31.670 align:middle line:84%
>> As I said, the vibration, the
frequency of existence itself is

00:28:31.670 --> 00:28:35.060 align:middle line:84%
what you translate in your
physical terms as unconditional

00:28:35.060 --> 00:28:37.730 align:middle line:90%
support, unconditional love.

00:28:37.730 --> 00:28:40.110 align:middle line:84%
You are in charge
of your reality.

00:28:40.110 --> 00:28:45.350 align:middle line:84%
What you say goes because you
are supported unconditionally.

00:28:45.350 --> 00:28:49.220 align:middle line:84%
So if you buy into negative
beliefs, all that is says,

00:28:49.220 --> 00:28:52.520 align:middle line:90%
OK, I will support you in that.

00:28:52.520 --> 00:28:55.670 align:middle line:84%
If you buy into positive
beliefs, all that is says,

00:28:55.670 --> 00:28:58.580 align:middle line:90%
OK, I will support you in that.

00:28:58.580 --> 00:29:03.470 align:middle line:84%
So it's up to you to decide
how to define your relationship

00:29:03.470 --> 00:29:06.770 align:middle line:84%
to all that is because you
are a unique reflection.

00:29:06.770 --> 00:29:10.160 align:middle line:84%
You are a puzzle piece in
the big picture puzzle.

00:29:10.160 --> 00:29:13.280 align:middle line:84%
And if you are the shape
that you were made to be,

00:29:13.280 --> 00:29:15.440 align:middle line:84%
in other words,
your true self, you

00:29:15.440 --> 00:29:17.780 align:middle line:84%
fit in the space
in the big picture

00:29:17.780 --> 00:29:19.640 align:middle line:84%
puzzle in which
you belong, and you

00:29:19.640 --> 00:29:21.710 align:middle line:90%
fit with all the other pieces.

00:29:21.710 --> 00:29:26.300 align:middle line:84%
So your shape defines
what everything else is

00:29:26.300 --> 00:29:30.850 align:middle line:84%
and you fit into the space
that is made for you, which

00:29:30.850 --> 00:29:34.180 align:middle line:84%
is, in a sense, something that
you could call the nothingness,

00:29:34.180 --> 00:29:36.040 align:middle line:90%
but you fit in that space.

00:29:36.040 --> 00:29:37.870 align:middle line:90%
The space is your potential.

00:29:37.870 --> 00:29:41.860 align:middle line:84%
The nothingness is your
potential to be realized by you.

00:29:41.860 --> 00:29:44.230 align:middle line:84%
So then your
self-realization, you

00:29:44.230 --> 00:29:48.120 align:middle line:84%
realize that you are a
reflection of everything.

00:29:48.120 --> 00:29:49.550 align:middle line:90%
Does that help?

00:29:49.550 --> 00:29:51.000 align:middle line:90%
>> It more than helps.

00:29:51.000 --> 00:29:52.120 align:middle line:10%
Is perfect.

00:29:52.120 --> 00:29:53.355 align:middle line:90%
Thank you so much.

00:29:53.355 --> 00:29:54.720 align:middle line:90%
>> You are so welcome.

00:29:54.720 --> 00:29:58.620 align:middle line:90%
