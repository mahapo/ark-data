00:00:04.870 --> 00:00:07.792 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:07.792 --> 00:00:11.220 align:middle line:90%


00:00:11.220 --> 00:00:15.090 align:middle line:84%
>> If, if you want to
practice automatic writing,

00:00:15.090 --> 00:00:17.910 align:middle line:84%
if you have a pen and
paper, it's very fun.

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:19.950 align:middle line:10%
Does anybody want to do that?

00:00:19.950 --> 00:00:20.750 align:middle line:10%
OK.

00:00:20.750 --> 00:00:23.740 align:middle line:10%
So what's going to happen is,
well, you're going to follow me.

00:00:23.740 --> 00:00:26.340 align:middle line:84%
First, we're going to do,
like I said, the cleanse.

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:30.600 align:middle line:84%
And then we're going to do
this, which I didn't talk about.

00:00:30.600 --> 00:00:33.960 align:middle line:84%
You're going to put yourself
in this bubble and this sphere

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:35.410 align:middle line:90%
of light, right?

00:00:35.410 --> 00:00:38.500 align:middle line:90%
And then you're going to extend.

00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:39.880 align:middle line:90%
You're going to create a bridge.

00:00:39.880 --> 00:00:42.100 align:middle line:84%
You see how you're
creating a bridge?

00:00:42.100 --> 00:00:47.530 align:middle line:10%
From your bubble, you're
going to create a bridge,

00:00:47.530 --> 00:00:53.650 align:middle line:10%
and then you're going to create
another circle, another sphere,

00:00:53.650 --> 00:00:57.760 align:middle line:10%
basically, around
the higher self

00:00:57.760 --> 00:01:01.790 align:middle line:10%
or whoever you're trying to
communicate with or source.

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:05.120 align:middle line:84%
I recommend source because
source is the original you.

00:01:05.120 --> 00:01:08.920 align:middle line:84%
You are originally
source, and source

00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:10.690 align:middle line:90%
knows everything about you.

00:01:10.690 --> 00:01:13.510 align:middle line:84%
Knows why you're here,
what you're supposed to do,

00:01:13.510 --> 00:01:15.850 align:middle line:84%
how to get on as
quickly as possible

00:01:15.850 --> 00:01:17.210 align:middle line:90%
with your higher purpose.

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:18.280 align:middle line:90%
Does that make sense?

00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:19.280 align:middle line:90%
I'm going to guide you.

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:20.870 align:middle line:84%
I just want to give
you the visuals.

00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:21.880 align:middle line:90%
Ready?

00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:23.110 align:middle line:90%
Here we go.

00:01:23.110 --> 00:01:28.080 align:middle line:84%
Let's sit up straight with
your feet flat on the floor.

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:31.050 align:middle line:84%
For those who are doing
automatic writing,

00:01:31.050 --> 00:01:35.040 align:middle line:84%
at one point, when I say
let's let the download begin,

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:40.020 align:middle line:84%
all you have to do is imagine
that the information is

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:42.670 align:middle line:84%
coming in, but it's
bypassing your brain.

00:01:42.670 --> 00:01:44.320 align:middle line:84%
It's not going
through your brain.

00:01:44.320 --> 00:01:48.360 align:middle line:84%
It's going directly through your
arm and out through your hand,

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:50.410 align:middle line:84%
and then your fingers
start to write.

00:01:50.410 --> 00:01:53.260 align:middle line:84%
You can keep your eyes
closed, even, if you like.

00:01:53.260 --> 00:01:56.470 align:middle line:84%
And it could be very garbled,
but that's the point,

00:01:56.470 --> 00:01:58.290 align:middle line:90%
and I'll help you interpret it.

00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:00.460 align:middle line:84%
I'll tell you how
to interpret it.

00:02:00.460 --> 00:02:03.990 align:middle line:84%
So that's the idea
of automatic writing.

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:06.360 align:middle line:84%
And then that way,
you know for sure,

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:09.430 align:middle line:84%
your human mind is
not interfering.

00:02:09.430 --> 00:02:12.690 align:middle line:84%
So when we do this exercise,
it's very important

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:14.920 align:middle line:90%
to stay in the feeling.

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:20.430 align:middle line:84%
So, for example, if I start
to receive information,

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:23.100 align:middle line:84%
I don't want to, in the
middle of the transmission,

00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:27.610 align:middle line:84%
start to comment, like, I didn't
know I'm supposed to do this,

00:02:27.610 --> 00:02:29.750 align:middle line:90%
or what does that mean?

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:33.130 align:middle line:84%
So make sure you are
in the experience.

00:02:33.130 --> 00:02:36.460 align:middle line:84%
For example, let's say
she receives a message

00:02:36.460 --> 00:02:40.090 align:middle line:84%
that it's supposed to be
three separate segments,

00:02:40.090 --> 00:02:44.000 align:middle line:84%
don't jump in the middle of the
meditation and say, oh, really?

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:46.690 align:middle line:84%
I thought it was two or
whatever, you know what I mean?

00:02:46.690 --> 00:02:49.190 align:middle line:90%
Don't engage.

00:02:49.190 --> 00:02:55.300 align:middle line:84%
And basically, imagine that
your human mind is not engaged.

00:02:55.300 --> 00:02:58.450 align:middle line:84%
The information is
coming directly to you,

00:02:58.450 --> 00:02:59.878 align:middle line:90%
and you're an observer.

00:02:59.878 --> 00:03:00.920 align:middle line:90%
You're like the observer.

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:02.170 align:middle line:90%
You're listening to something.

00:03:02.170 --> 00:03:04.810 align:middle line:84%
You're receiving something
and you're like, OK, OK, OK.

00:03:04.810 --> 00:03:09.760 align:middle line:84%
Just allow the information to
come through until the very end.

00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:12.790 align:middle line:84%
At the end, sometimes,
you may see a color

00:03:12.790 --> 00:03:14.930 align:middle line:90%
or you may see geometry.

00:03:14.930 --> 00:03:17.950 align:middle line:84%
So for example, make
sure you don't say,

00:03:17.950 --> 00:03:20.067 align:middle line:84%
I'm seeing-- what does
that mean, blue color?

00:03:20.067 --> 00:03:20.900 align:middle line:90%
What does that mean?

00:03:20.900 --> 00:03:21.855 align:middle line:90%
What does blue mean?

00:03:21.855 --> 00:03:22.730 align:middle line:90%
And blah, blah, blah.

00:03:22.730 --> 00:03:24.850 align:middle line:90%
So don't talk, basically.

00:03:24.850 --> 00:03:25.780 align:middle line:90%
Make sense?

00:03:25.780 --> 00:03:27.170 align:middle line:90%
Until the very end.

00:03:27.170 --> 00:03:28.340 align:middle line:90%
OK, here we go.

00:03:28.340 --> 00:03:30.900 align:middle line:90%
Ready?

00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:35.940 align:middle line:84%
Sit up straight with your
feet flat on the floor

00:03:35.940 --> 00:03:37.340 align:middle line:90%
and close your eyes.

00:03:37.340 --> 00:03:41.370 align:middle line:90%


00:03:41.370 --> 00:03:43.755 align:middle line:84%
And let's take a deep
breath in through the nose.

00:03:43.755 --> 00:03:44.555 align:middle line:90%
Deep breath.

00:03:44.555 --> 00:03:48.830 align:middle line:90%


00:03:48.830 --> 00:03:50.755 align:middle line:90%
Exhale through the mouth.

00:03:50.755 --> 00:03:58.730 align:middle line:90%


00:03:58.730 --> 00:04:00.273 align:middle line:84%
Again, breathe in
through the nose.

00:04:00.273 --> 00:04:05.220 align:middle line:90%


00:04:05.220 --> 00:04:06.830 align:middle line:90%
Exhale through the mouth.

00:04:06.830 --> 00:04:16.240 align:middle line:90%


00:04:16.240 --> 00:04:17.779 align:middle line:84%
Again, breathe in
through the nose.

00:04:17.779 --> 00:04:18.579 align:middle line:90%
Deep breath.

00:04:18.579 --> 00:04:20.930 align:middle line:90%


00:04:20.930 --> 00:04:25.563 align:middle line:84%
As you exhale through the
mouth, quiet your mind.

00:04:25.563 --> 00:04:31.280 align:middle line:90%


00:04:31.280 --> 00:04:32.605 align:middle line:90%
Quiet your thoughts.

00:04:32.605 --> 00:04:41.340 align:middle line:90%


00:04:41.340 --> 00:04:43.180 align:middle line:84%
Again, breathe in
through the nose.

00:04:43.180 --> 00:04:44.225 align:middle line:90%
Deep breath.

00:04:44.225 --> 00:04:48.170 align:middle line:90%


00:04:48.170 --> 00:04:50.020 align:middle line:90%
Exhale through the mouth.

00:04:50.020 --> 00:04:59.140 align:middle line:90%


00:04:59.140 --> 00:05:12.040 align:middle line:10%
As you bring your focus to your
heart, say quietly in your mind,

00:05:12.040 --> 00:05:18.900 align:middle line:10%
I ask and intend to
create a sacred space.

00:05:18.900 --> 00:05:26.720 align:middle line:90%


00:05:26.720 --> 00:05:36.500 align:middle line:84%
I ask to let go of all
distracting thoughts,

00:05:36.500 --> 00:05:44.454 align:middle line:84%
distracting energy,
distracting information.

00:05:44.454 --> 00:05:49.300 align:middle line:90%


00:05:49.300 --> 00:06:05.743 align:middle line:84%
My intent is to clear my energy
and to receive clear guidance.

00:06:05.743 --> 00:06:09.430 align:middle line:90%


00:06:09.430 --> 00:06:30.140 align:middle line:84%
Clear information directly from
the source, who I really am,

00:06:30.140 --> 00:06:34.543 align:middle line:90%
my pure, original essence.

00:06:34.543 --> 00:06:37.350 align:middle line:90%


00:06:37.350 --> 00:06:38.740 align:middle line:90%
Breathe in through the nose.

00:06:38.740 --> 00:06:41.050 align:middle line:90%
Deep breath.

00:06:41.050 --> 00:06:47.430 align:middle line:84%
As you exhale through the
mouth, from the heart,

00:06:47.430 --> 00:06:49.733 align:middle line:90%
expand 360 degrees.

00:06:49.733 --> 00:06:53.960 align:middle line:90%


00:06:53.960 --> 00:06:59.800 align:middle line:84%
And put yourself in
a sphere of light,

00:06:59.800 --> 00:07:02.573 align:middle line:90%
about 5 to 7 feet in diameter.

00:07:02.573 --> 00:07:09.900 align:middle line:90%


00:07:09.900 --> 00:07:21.075 align:middle line:84%
Imagine all the misaligned
energy just coming up.

00:07:21.075 --> 00:07:26.760 align:middle line:90%


00:07:26.760 --> 00:07:40.150 align:middle line:84%
And ask and say, I want to clear
my physical body, my energy

00:07:40.150 --> 00:07:50.420 align:middle line:84%
field, from all misaligned
and unnecessary information.

00:07:50.420 --> 00:07:51.730 align:middle line:90%
Breathe in through the nose.

00:07:51.730 --> 00:07:54.650 align:middle line:90%
Deep breath.

00:07:54.650 --> 00:08:00.920 align:middle line:84%
As you exhale through
the mouth, imagine

00:08:00.920 --> 00:08:08.820 align:middle line:84%
that you are purging
all this information.

00:08:08.820 --> 00:08:16.750 align:middle line:84%
All these particles of energy
are just coming out of your body

00:08:16.750 --> 00:08:20.990 align:middle line:90%
and out of your sphere.

00:08:20.990 --> 00:08:22.103 align:middle line:90%
They just dissolve.

00:08:22.103 --> 00:08:28.400 align:middle line:90%


00:08:28.400 --> 00:08:34.030 align:middle line:84%
Visualize a bright,
bright white light.

00:08:34.030 --> 00:08:37.929 align:middle line:90%


00:08:37.929 --> 00:08:44.953 align:middle line:90%
This light is pure source.

00:08:44.953 --> 00:08:51.130 align:middle line:90%


00:08:51.130 --> 00:08:53.993 align:middle line:90%
Pure, unconditional love.

00:08:53.993 --> 00:08:57.940 align:middle line:90%


00:08:57.940 --> 00:09:05.020 align:middle line:84%
Bring this light down through
the top of your head, slowly,

00:09:05.020 --> 00:09:05.820 align:middle line:90%
slowly.

00:09:05.820 --> 00:09:10.320 align:middle line:90%


00:09:10.320 --> 00:09:21.730 align:middle line:84%
And it starts to go deep,
every cell in your skull,

00:09:21.730 --> 00:09:34.190 align:middle line:84%
your brain, your
cheeks, your jaw.

00:09:34.190 --> 00:09:41.863 align:middle line:84%
Slowly, slowly, source,
light, clearing, healing.

00:09:41.863 --> 00:09:46.720 align:middle line:90%


00:09:46.720 --> 00:09:49.503 align:middle line:84%
Bring it down through
your neck and throat.

00:09:49.503 --> 00:09:57.600 align:middle line:90%


00:09:57.600 --> 00:09:58.460 align:middle line:90%
Shoulders.

00:09:58.460 --> 00:10:03.063 align:middle line:90%


00:10:03.063 --> 00:10:03.863 align:middle line:90%
Arms.

00:10:03.863 --> 00:10:08.840 align:middle line:90%


00:10:08.840 --> 00:10:10.750 align:middle line:90%
Upper back.

00:10:10.750 --> 00:10:11.550 align:middle line:90%
Chest.

00:10:11.550 --> 00:10:19.543 align:middle line:90%


00:10:19.543 --> 00:10:20.343 align:middle line:90%
Lower back.

00:10:20.343 --> 00:10:23.260 align:middle line:90%


00:10:23.260 --> 00:10:24.060 align:middle line:90%
Stomach.

00:10:24.060 --> 00:10:31.940 align:middle line:90%


00:10:31.940 --> 00:10:34.230 align:middle line:90%
Hips.

00:10:34.230 --> 00:10:35.030 align:middle line:90%
Belly.

00:10:35.030 --> 00:10:38.493 align:middle line:90%


00:10:38.493 --> 00:10:39.293 align:middle line:90%
Thighs.

00:10:39.293 --> 00:10:43.930 align:middle line:90%


00:10:43.930 --> 00:10:44.730 align:middle line:90%
Knees.

00:10:44.730 --> 00:10:48.255 align:middle line:90%


00:10:48.255 --> 00:10:49.055 align:middle line:90%
Ankles.

00:10:49.055 --> 00:10:52.460 align:middle line:90%


00:10:52.460 --> 00:10:53.260 align:middle line:90%
Feet.

00:10:53.260 --> 00:10:56.390 align:middle line:90%


00:10:56.390 --> 00:10:59.840 align:middle line:84%
Let it come out through
the bottom of your feet,

00:10:59.840 --> 00:11:04.040 align:middle line:90%
anchoring you into the ground.

00:11:04.040 --> 00:11:05.540 align:middle line:90%
Breathe in through the nose.

00:11:05.540 --> 00:11:06.340 align:middle line:90%
Deep breath.

00:11:06.340 --> 00:11:08.920 align:middle line:90%


00:11:08.920 --> 00:11:19.700 align:middle line:84%
As you exhale through the mouth,
imagine every cell in your body

00:11:19.700 --> 00:11:30.850 align:middle line:84%
opening up, and absorbing this
pure light, from head to toe,

00:11:30.850 --> 00:11:32.473 align:middle line:90%
to the tip of your fingers.

00:11:32.473 --> 00:11:43.070 align:middle line:90%


00:11:43.070 --> 00:11:45.865 align:middle line:84%
You are totally
filled with light.

00:11:45.865 --> 00:11:51.260 align:middle line:90%


00:11:51.260 --> 00:11:52.060 align:middle line:90%
Source.

00:11:52.060 --> 00:11:57.740 align:middle line:90%


00:11:57.740 --> 00:11:59.065 align:middle line:90%
Unconditional love.

00:11:59.065 --> 00:12:09.630 align:middle line:90%


00:12:09.630 --> 00:12:13.050 align:middle line:90%
Breathe in through the nose.

00:12:13.050 --> 00:12:14.945 align:middle line:90%
Exhale through the mouth.

00:12:14.945 --> 00:12:23.290 align:middle line:90%


00:12:23.290 --> 00:12:35.185 align:middle line:84%
Continue to feel
yourself being all light.

00:12:35.185 --> 00:12:41.700 align:middle line:90%


00:12:41.700 --> 00:12:44.360 align:middle line:84%
Say quietly in your
mind, I am clear.

00:12:44.360 --> 00:12:48.320 align:middle line:90%


00:12:48.320 --> 00:12:49.255 align:middle line:90%
I am healed.

00:12:49.255 --> 00:12:54.910 align:middle line:90%


00:12:54.910 --> 00:12:55.845 align:middle line:90%
I am loved.

00:12:55.845 --> 00:13:06.160 align:middle line:90%


00:13:06.160 --> 00:13:10.843 align:middle line:84%
Breathe in through the nose, as
you exhale through the mouth.

00:13:10.843 --> 00:13:14.480 align:middle line:90%


00:13:14.480 --> 00:13:23.390 align:middle line:84%
Now, begin to focus on the
sphere of light around your body

00:13:23.390 --> 00:13:27.023 align:middle line:84%
and the outer boundary
of your sphere.

00:13:27.023 --> 00:13:30.250 align:middle line:90%


00:13:30.250 --> 00:13:36.080 align:middle line:84%
And from there, begin
to create a bridge.

00:13:36.080 --> 00:13:43.140 align:middle line:90%
Extend your sphere.

00:13:43.140 --> 00:13:54.130 align:middle line:84%
Allow this bridge to
extend and connect you

00:13:54.130 --> 00:13:55.473 align:middle line:90%
with your higher self.

00:13:55.473 --> 00:14:00.100 align:middle line:90%


00:14:00.100 --> 00:14:05.470 align:middle line:84%
At the end of this bridge,
create another bubble,

00:14:05.470 --> 00:14:11.315 align:middle line:84%
another sphere around
your higher self

00:14:11.315 --> 00:14:20.220 align:middle line:84%
or the consciousness you
want information from.

00:14:20.220 --> 00:14:30.310 align:middle line:84%
Now, begin to imagine that the
information is flowing down

00:14:30.310 --> 00:14:40.595 align:middle line:84%
from there, bubbled through the
bridge, into your consciousness.

00:14:40.595 --> 00:14:43.750 align:middle line:90%


00:14:43.750 --> 00:14:52.120 align:middle line:84%
Begin to feel, bypass your
human mind and feel the energy.

00:14:52.120 --> 00:15:00.160 align:middle line:84%
And for those who are
writing, visualize this energy

00:15:00.160 --> 00:15:05.170 align:middle line:84%
going directly through your
arm, through your hand,

00:15:05.170 --> 00:15:11.020 align:middle line:84%
and it literally just
moves your hands.

00:15:11.020 --> 00:15:16.270 align:middle line:84%
Begin to write, begin the
download, without interruption,

00:15:16.270 --> 00:15:17.103 align:middle line:90%
as an observer.

00:15:17.103 --> 00:17:02.920 align:middle line:90%


00:17:02.920 --> 00:17:06.109 align:middle line:84%
Continue to breathe
in through the nose,

00:17:06.109 --> 00:17:08.130 align:middle line:90%
as you exhale through the mouth.

00:17:08.130 --> 00:17:37.060 align:middle line:90%


00:17:37.060 --> 00:17:39.060 align:middle line:84%
Bring your focus
back to your heart.

00:17:39.060 --> 00:17:51.330 align:middle line:90%


00:17:51.330 --> 00:17:54.690 align:middle line:84%
If you are complete,
you can open your eyes

00:17:54.690 --> 00:17:55.700 align:middle line:90%
whenever you're ready.

00:17:55.700 --> 00:18:26.300 align:middle line:90%


00:18:26.300 --> 00:18:29.600 align:middle line:90%
OK, you're back.

00:18:29.600 --> 00:18:35.270 align:middle line:84%
First of all, how do
you feel right now?

00:18:35.270 --> 00:18:37.460 align:middle line:90%
Much better.

00:18:37.460 --> 00:18:38.810 align:middle line:90%
What do you feel?

00:18:38.810 --> 00:18:39.610 align:middle line:90%
Can you share?

00:18:39.610 --> 00:18:42.880 align:middle line:90%


00:18:42.880 --> 00:18:43.710 align:middle line:90%
Relaxed.

00:18:43.710 --> 00:18:44.510 align:middle line:90%
>> Connected.

00:18:44.510 --> 00:18:45.530 align:middle line:90%
>> Connected.

00:18:45.530 --> 00:18:46.330 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:18:46.330 --> 00:18:47.720 align:middle line:90%
What else do you feel?

00:18:47.720 --> 00:18:48.520 align:middle line:90%
>> Pure.

00:18:48.520 --> 00:18:49.380 align:middle line:90%
>> Pure.

00:18:49.380 --> 00:18:50.180 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:18:50.180 --> 00:18:51.050 align:middle line:90%
Who else?

00:18:51.050 --> 00:18:51.850 align:middle line:90%
>> Present

00:18:51.850 --> 00:18:53.470 align:middle line:90%
>> Present.

00:18:53.470 --> 00:18:55.870 align:middle line:90%
Expanded.

00:18:55.870 --> 00:18:57.050 align:middle line:90%
Elevated.

00:18:57.050 --> 00:18:57.850 align:middle line:90%
>> Vibrating.

00:18:57.850 --> 00:18:59.270 align:middle line:90%
>> Vibrating.

00:18:59.270 --> 00:19:00.070 align:middle line:90%
>> Inspired

00:19:00.070 --> 00:19:01.216 align:middle line:90%
>> Inspired.

00:19:01.216 --> 00:19:02.620 align:middle line:90%
>> Lighter.

00:19:02.620 --> 00:19:03.486 align:middle line:90%
>> Lighter.

00:19:03.486 --> 00:19:04.630 align:middle line:90%
>> Heart centered.

00:19:04.630 --> 00:19:06.460 align:middle line:90%
>> Heart centered.

00:19:06.460 --> 00:19:09.850 align:middle line:84%
This is how you're
supposed to feel

00:19:09.850 --> 00:19:15.220 align:middle line:84%
at the beginning of every day
and definitely before any sort

00:19:15.220 --> 00:19:18.760 align:middle line:90%
of asking for guidance.

00:19:18.760 --> 00:19:23.470 align:middle line:84%
I guess I could have
started the class with this,

00:19:23.470 --> 00:19:28.810 align:middle line:84%
but sometimes, the
meditations are so strong.

00:19:28.810 --> 00:19:31.360 align:middle line:84%
You're still processing
if you don't--

00:19:31.360 --> 00:19:35.200 align:middle line:84%
those of you who are sensitive,
we moved a lot of energy,

00:19:35.200 --> 00:19:40.340 align:middle line:84%
actually, and there's still kind
of stuff leaving and processing.

00:19:40.340 --> 00:19:46.550 align:middle line:84%
But it's that energy of
calm, but then it's better.

00:19:46.550 --> 00:19:49.280 align:middle line:90%
Anyway, we did it how we did it.

00:19:49.280 --> 00:19:52.730 align:middle line:84%
So that's the reason why
I'm taking a minute for you

00:19:52.730 --> 00:19:56.030 align:middle line:84%
to notice how you
were 30 minutes ago

00:19:56.030 --> 00:19:57.780 align:middle line:90%
and how you are right now.

00:19:57.780 --> 00:20:01.460 align:middle line:84%
So let's take a moment
to set the intention

00:20:01.460 --> 00:20:05.590 align:middle line:90%
to recognize this frequency.

00:20:05.590 --> 00:20:08.020 align:middle line:90%
So train your brain.

00:20:08.020 --> 00:20:12.020 align:middle line:84%
Tell your brain right
now, this is the frequency

00:20:12.020 --> 00:20:18.280 align:middle line:84%
when I feel calm, connected,
aligned, centered, at peace,

00:20:18.280 --> 00:20:21.690 align:middle line:90%
whatever else, inspired.

00:20:21.690 --> 00:20:26.730 align:middle line:10%
Put it in your programming
so your brain knows

00:20:26.730 --> 00:20:29.330 align:middle line:10%
how to go back there instantly.

00:20:29.330 --> 00:20:33.100 align:middle line:10%
Of course, also, that's why
I put these links up there,

00:20:33.100 --> 00:20:35.820 align:middle line:10%
if you guys want
to take that code,

00:20:35.820 --> 00:20:41.790 align:middle line:10%
because I have all these tons of
free meditations on my YouTube.

00:20:41.790 --> 00:20:47.370 align:middle line:10%
But also, my website has a free
meditation called "Connecting

00:20:47.370 --> 00:20:49.500 align:middle line:10%
to Source," which,
in seven minutes,

00:20:49.500 --> 00:20:52.120 align:middle line:10%
brings you back to this place.

00:20:52.120 --> 00:20:53.910 align:middle line:84%
So you can just
go to the website

00:20:53.910 --> 00:20:56.290 align:middle line:84%
and just play the
thing every day.

00:20:56.290 --> 00:20:58.030 align:middle line:90%
It's free of charge.

00:20:58.030 --> 00:21:01.350 align:middle line:84%
So that your brain
knows that this

00:21:01.350 --> 00:21:04.230 align:middle line:84%
is where I need to be before
I ask for any guidance,

00:21:04.230 --> 00:21:06.040 align:middle line:90%
before I ask any questions.

00:21:06.040 --> 00:21:08.400 align:middle line:90%
Make sense?

00:21:08.400 --> 00:21:10.740 align:middle line:84%
OK, now, let's see
if we can interpret.

00:21:10.740 --> 00:21:12.690 align:middle line:90%
Who did automatic writing?

00:21:12.690 --> 00:21:13.720 align:middle line:90%
Who got a download?

00:21:13.720 --> 00:21:18.750 align:middle line:84%
OK, so she got images
coming down, OK?

00:21:18.750 --> 00:21:21.120 align:middle line:90%
>> [INDISTINCT SPEECH]

00:21:21.120 --> 00:21:24.390 align:middle line:84%
>> OK, she was just
seeing visuals and stuff.

00:21:24.390 --> 00:21:25.620 align:middle line:90%
She had a light show.

00:21:25.620 --> 00:21:27.000 align:middle line:90%
Anybody else?

00:21:27.000 --> 00:21:28.090 align:middle line:90%
OK, go ahead.

00:21:28.090 --> 00:21:29.440 align:middle line:90%
What was your intention?

00:21:29.440 --> 00:21:32.850 align:middle line:84%
What was your question,
and what did you get?

00:21:32.850 --> 00:21:35.746 align:middle line:84%
>> So my question was
I have a son, who is 9,

00:21:35.746 --> 00:21:41.170 align:middle line:90%
and he's on the spectrum, and--

00:21:41.170 --> 00:21:42.650 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:21:42.650 --> 00:21:46.300 align:middle line:84%
She was asking about her
son, who's on the spectrum,

00:21:46.300 --> 00:21:50.120 align:middle line:84%
and she wanted to know
how he should be cleansed.

00:21:50.120 --> 00:21:55.310 align:middle line:84%
So first of all, that was pretty
good that you got these answers.

00:21:55.310 --> 00:22:00.220 align:middle line:84%
But the one thing that I can
tell you right now, the kids who

00:22:00.220 --> 00:22:03.640 align:middle line:84%
are autistic are actually--
it's very fascinating

00:22:03.640 --> 00:22:07.810 align:middle line:84%
because when I look at them,
I see that they are always

00:22:07.810 --> 00:22:12.100 align:middle line:84%
actually already connected
to a different range,

00:22:12.100 --> 00:22:13.660 align:middle line:90%
a different frequency range.

00:22:13.660 --> 00:22:15.910 align:middle line:84%
That's why they're not paying
attention here because--

00:22:15.910 --> 00:22:18.730 align:middle line:84%
and that frequency range
is usually very high,

00:22:18.730 --> 00:22:20.750 align:middle line:90%
and it's very stimulating.

00:22:20.750 --> 00:22:24.170 align:middle line:84%
And that frequency is
outside the human range.

00:22:24.170 --> 00:22:27.860 align:middle line:84%
That's why-- it's much
lower frequency down here.

00:22:27.860 --> 00:22:30.430 align:middle line:84%
That's why they're not
very interested in adapting

00:22:30.430 --> 00:22:31.580 align:middle line:90%
to the human--

00:22:31.580 --> 00:22:33.612 align:middle line:90%
it's very slow.

00:22:33.612 --> 00:22:35.560 align:middle line:84%
But one thing I
wanted to tell you

00:22:35.560 --> 00:22:39.710 align:middle line:84%
is that they benefit greatly
from this particular meditation.

00:22:39.710 --> 00:22:43.730 align:middle line:84%
Just this source connection
going through him,

00:22:43.730 --> 00:22:46.790 align:middle line:84%
because he's going to
feel like you're feeling,

00:22:46.790 --> 00:22:49.770 align:middle line:90%
calm, centered, connected.

00:22:49.770 --> 00:22:51.650 align:middle line:10%
And so what happens
is that we try

00:22:51.650 --> 00:22:56.880 align:middle line:10%
to pull the kids who are
autistic to function here,

00:22:56.880 --> 00:22:59.300 align:middle line:10%
and it's very hard because
they don't understand

00:22:59.300 --> 00:23:02.040 align:middle line:10%
this whole frequency down here.

00:23:02.040 --> 00:23:05.930 align:middle line:10%
The idea is to train them
to maintain that frequency

00:23:05.930 --> 00:23:09.960 align:middle line:10%
and also communicate down here.

00:23:09.960 --> 00:23:12.680 align:middle line:10%
So it's a very
specific training.

00:23:12.680 --> 00:23:17.270 align:middle line:84%
But anyway, I recommend that
you teach him this meditation

00:23:17.270 --> 00:23:21.530 align:middle line:84%
or do it with him,
even for him, as well,

00:23:21.530 --> 00:23:23.250 align:middle line:90%
and see if this will help.

00:23:23.250 --> 00:23:27.170 align:middle line:84%
By the way, you guys can do
this with any family member

00:23:27.170 --> 00:23:29.700 align:middle line:84%
who's sick or who
cannot communicate.

00:23:29.700 --> 00:23:31.705 align:middle line:10%
So you do your own bubble.

00:23:31.705 --> 00:23:33.080 align:middle line:10%
I mean, there's
a whole training,

00:23:33.080 --> 00:23:36.650 align:middle line:10%
but now I'm just giving you
the kind of crash course.

00:23:36.650 --> 00:23:38.990 align:middle line:10%
And then you extend,
you create the bridge.

00:23:38.990 --> 00:23:41.210 align:middle line:10%
Then you create a
bubble around him,

00:23:41.210 --> 00:23:44.600 align:middle line:10%
and then you do the
meditation yourself.

00:23:44.600 --> 00:23:48.360 align:middle line:10%
And at the end, you bring
the energy back to you.

00:23:48.360 --> 00:23:50.940 align:middle line:10%
Don't stay connected
with him that way.

00:23:50.940 --> 00:23:54.380 align:middle line:10%
Remember, we said we don't want
other people's energy in us

00:23:54.380 --> 00:23:56.720 align:middle line:10%
or connected to us all the time.

00:23:56.720 --> 00:23:58.660 align:middle line:10%
OK, try that.

00:23:58.660 --> 00:24:01.360 align:middle line:10%
I've worked-- it's so
interesting because when I first

00:24:01.360 --> 00:24:04.480 align:middle line:10%
started out, I was
very young, and I

00:24:04.480 --> 00:24:06.010 align:middle line:10%
developed all
these methodologies

00:24:06.010 --> 00:24:07.510 align:middle line:10%
for healing and stuff.

00:24:07.510 --> 00:24:11.720 align:middle line:84%
And my very first cases
were super complicated.

00:24:11.720 --> 00:24:15.220 align:middle line:84%
They were quadriplegic
kids, autistic kids,

00:24:15.220 --> 00:24:17.260 align:middle line:84%
who could not
communicate at all.

00:24:17.260 --> 00:24:20.470 align:middle line:84%
So I would work with the
mother as a surrogate,

00:24:20.470 --> 00:24:23.960 align:middle line:84%
and then I would see,
using different techniques.

00:24:23.960 --> 00:24:26.080 align:middle line:84%
But eventually-- for
example, she would say,

00:24:26.080 --> 00:24:27.890 align:middle line:90%
he's not eating or whatever.

00:24:27.890 --> 00:24:32.410 align:middle line:10%
So we would do this session, and
then he would come home and eat.

00:24:32.410 --> 00:24:36.050 align:middle line:84%
So it's pretty crazy
how we're all connected.

00:24:36.050 --> 00:24:37.340 align:middle line:90%
This is all very real.

00:24:37.340 --> 00:24:43.100 align:middle line:10%
Anyway, can we have one more
person share a quick-- yeah.

00:24:43.100 --> 00:24:45.920 align:middle line:84%
>> Hey, so I guess
my question is,

00:24:45.920 --> 00:24:50.030 align:middle line:90%
I still struggle with hearing.

00:24:50.030 --> 00:24:52.535 align:middle line:84%
I just can sit in
yoga nidra or sit

00:24:52.535 --> 00:24:55.580 align:middle line:84%
in a meditation for
a long extended time,

00:24:55.580 --> 00:24:57.800 align:middle line:90%
but nothing is coming.

00:24:57.800 --> 00:25:00.320 align:middle line:84%
So is that just
with practice or--

00:25:00.320 --> 00:25:03.980 align:middle line:84%
>> OK, because you said I have
trouble hearing because it's not

00:25:03.980 --> 00:25:05.870 align:middle line:90%
about hearing.

00:25:05.870 --> 00:25:06.670 align:middle line:90%
You see?

00:25:06.670 --> 00:25:11.330 align:middle line:10%
I mean, I've been talking to
you about receiving information.

00:25:11.330 --> 00:25:13.070 align:middle line:84%
Information is not
always hearing.

00:25:13.070 --> 00:25:15.190 align:middle line:84%
Like we were saying,
sometimes, you go in a room,

00:25:15.190 --> 00:25:17.510 align:middle line:84%
you sense there's something
wrong with your friend.

00:25:17.510 --> 00:25:18.460 align:middle line:90%
You didn't hear it.

00:25:18.460 --> 00:25:19.880 align:middle line:90%
You sensed it.

00:25:19.880 --> 00:25:22.820 align:middle line:84%
That's why I kept saying,
stay in the feeling.

00:25:22.820 --> 00:25:23.810 align:middle line:90%
Stay in the feeling.

00:25:23.810 --> 00:25:24.643 align:middle line:90%
Stay in the feeling.

00:25:24.643 --> 00:25:27.590 align:middle line:84%
The more you stay in the
feeling-- there's a huge fear,

00:25:27.590 --> 00:25:30.890 align:middle line:84%
I could see that,
around your heart.

00:25:30.890 --> 00:25:32.180 align:middle line:90%
And it comes from your mother.

00:25:32.180 --> 00:25:35.170 align:middle line:84%
It's a long story, but we're
not going to get into that right

00:25:35.170 --> 00:25:35.970 align:middle line:90%
now.

00:25:35.970 --> 00:25:40.870 align:middle line:10%
But what I'm saying is,
you have to clear the fear

00:25:40.870 --> 00:25:45.770 align:middle line:10%
and allow yourself to feel,
not force yourself to hear.

00:25:45.770 --> 00:25:47.150 align:middle line:90%
It's not about hearing.

00:25:47.150 --> 00:25:48.800 align:middle line:90%
Makes sense?

00:25:48.800 --> 00:25:52.040 align:middle line:84%
So anyway, I guess they're
going to kick us out,

00:25:52.040 --> 00:25:54.420 align:middle line:90%
so I better kick myself out.

00:25:54.420 --> 00:26:00.030 align:middle line:10%
So please, use this information
to continue the work.

00:26:00.030 --> 00:26:05.600 align:middle line:84%
Lots of stuff on YouTube,
and thank you very much.
