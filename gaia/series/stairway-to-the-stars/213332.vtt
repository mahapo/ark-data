00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:12.425 align:middle line:90%


00:00:12.425 --> 00:00:15.070 align:middle line:10%
>> So I'll just tell you a
little bit about myself real

00:00:15.070 --> 00:00:16.300 align:middle line:10%
quick.

00:00:16.300 --> 00:00:18.600 align:middle line:90%
I was actually born in France.

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:20.560 align:middle line:90%
My parents are Americans.

00:00:20.560 --> 00:00:24.090 align:middle line:84%
I was born in a Knights
Templar castle in France.

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:27.660 align:middle line:90%


00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:31.360 align:middle line:10%
But yeah, I lived for a while
in France as a little kid

00:00:31.360 --> 00:00:36.330 align:middle line:10%
and then I grew up really
in Colorado and Montana,

00:00:36.330 --> 00:00:43.140 align:middle line:10%
and I went to high school and
college in Missoula, Montana.

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:46.570 align:middle line:10%
And then I had a chance to go
to-- my parents like to travel

00:00:46.570 --> 00:00:51.810 align:middle line:10%
and so at an early age, I
went to Stonehenge and Carnac,

00:00:51.810 --> 00:00:56.820 align:middle line:10%
to Greece and Turkey and places
like that, also down to Mexico

00:00:56.820 --> 00:00:59.070 align:middle line:10%
to see Teotihuacan and stuff.

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:01.140 align:middle line:84%
And then I had the
chance in the mid-70s

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:04.989 align:middle line:84%
to go to Taiwan as
an English teacher.

00:01:04.989 --> 00:01:05.830 align:middle line:90%
So I did that.

00:01:05.830 --> 00:01:07.360 align:middle line:90%
I went to Japan and Taiwan.

00:01:07.360 --> 00:01:11.610 align:middle line:10%
I've always been a skier
and a mountain climber,

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:15.870 align:middle line:10%
so I wanted to go to
Mount Everest and Tibet.

00:01:15.870 --> 00:01:20.640 align:middle line:84%
Like Bob Sieger would say,
I'm going to Kathmandu.

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:24.300 align:middle line:84%
And so I did all that, and I
traveled across the Middle East

00:01:24.300 --> 00:01:27.080 align:middle line:90%
and went to Israel and to Egypt.

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:30.040 align:middle line:84%
Later, I lived for 2
and 1/2 years in Africa.

00:01:30.040 --> 00:01:35.500 align:middle line:84%
I worked for Chevron Oil
in Sudan for a while.

00:01:35.500 --> 00:01:41.190 align:middle line:84%
I eventually returned to India
and China, Japan, and Korea,

00:01:41.190 --> 00:01:41.990 align:middle line:90%
and whatnot.

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:43.940 align:middle line:84%
And then I got back
to the United States.

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:48.040 align:middle line:84%
And then I went down to South
America and Central America

00:01:48.040 --> 00:01:51.370 align:middle line:84%
and traveled through the
Pacific, went to Easter Island

00:01:51.370 --> 00:01:54.448 align:middle line:84%
like three times,
Nan Madol and stuff.

00:01:54.448 --> 00:01:56.740 align:middle line:84%
So I've traveled around the
world and I started writing

00:01:56.740 --> 00:02:00.820 align:middle line:84%
books in the mid-80s,
my "Lost Cities" books.

00:02:00.820 --> 00:02:04.570 align:middle line:10%
And was on some TV shows,
and then along came "Ancient

00:02:04.570 --> 00:02:05.510 align:middle line:10%
Aliens."

00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:08.020 align:middle line:10%
And that was great.

00:02:08.020 --> 00:02:12.490 align:middle line:10%
People sometimes recognize me
at airports and they say, hey,

00:02:12.490 --> 00:02:14.895 align:middle line:10%
are you that guy on
"Ancient Aliens"?

00:02:14.895 --> 00:02:16.750 align:middle line:10%
I'll go, yeah, yeah.

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:20.205 align:middle line:10%
And then they always say to me,
what's with that guy's hair?

00:02:20.205 --> 00:02:23.250 align:middle line:90%


00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:26.730 align:middle line:90%
Giorgio is a great guy.

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:30.840 align:middle line:84%
So "Ancient Aliens" got started
actually because of "Indiana

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:32.500 align:middle line:90%
Jones and the Crystal Skull."

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:36.450 align:middle line:10%
That's really what kind of
got "Ancient Aliens" going.

00:02:36.450 --> 00:02:39.430 align:middle line:10%
And "Ancient Aliens" started
as a two-hour special.

00:02:39.430 --> 00:02:41.820 align:middle line:10%
And then it got picked
up as a TV show.

00:02:41.820 --> 00:02:46.770 align:middle line:10%
And it's been going now for
15 years and still going.

00:02:46.770 --> 00:02:50.220 align:middle line:10%
So anyway, let's get going here.

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:54.510 align:middle line:84%
As an archeologist and
traveler and researcher,

00:02:54.510 --> 00:03:00.510 align:middle line:84%
I've just always been fascinated
by megaliths, power tools,

00:03:00.510 --> 00:03:03.040 align:middle line:84%
and all the kind of things
that go along with all that.

00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:04.950 align:middle line:84%
So let's start talking
about all that.

00:03:04.950 --> 00:03:07.980 align:middle line:84%
The largest known
megaliths that we know of

00:03:07.980 --> 00:03:12.000 align:middle line:84%
are at Baalbek in Lebanon,
and they are gigantically

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:14.970 align:middle line:90%
huge blocks of stone.

00:03:14.970 --> 00:03:18.120 align:middle line:84%
This is my friend Ralph
Ellis at one of the-- this

00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:19.000 align:middle line:90%
is in the quarry.

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:21.540 align:middle line:84%
This one was quarried and
squared but never moved

00:03:21.540 --> 00:03:23.380 align:middle line:90%
into place.

00:03:23.380 --> 00:03:26.770 align:middle line:84%
They say that the heaviest stone
that they've found there is

00:03:26.770 --> 00:03:30.940 align:middle line:90%
1,650 tons.

00:03:30.940 --> 00:03:38.710 align:middle line:10%
Even something that weighs 2 or
3 or 5 tons is extremely heavy.

00:03:38.710 --> 00:03:43.360 align:middle line:10%
Things that weigh 20 tons or
50 or 80 or 100 tons, these

00:03:43.360 --> 00:03:47.110 align:middle line:10%
are already super
duper heavy things.

00:03:47.110 --> 00:03:53.790 align:middle line:10%
When you're talking about
megaliths weigh like 1,000 tons,

00:03:53.790 --> 00:03:56.010 align:middle line:10%
I mean, it's just
impossibly heavy.

00:03:56.010 --> 00:03:59.320 align:middle line:84%
Even we couldn't really
move things like this today.

00:03:59.320 --> 00:04:02.460 align:middle line:84%
Your average obelisk
weighs about 500 tons.

00:04:02.460 --> 00:04:04.150 align:middle line:90%
We'll talk about that later.

00:04:04.150 --> 00:04:10.810 align:middle line:10%
Now, what you have at Baalbek is
a huge platform with these giant

00:04:10.810 --> 00:04:14.690 align:middle line:10%
blocks weighing like 1,000
tons as part of the platform.

00:04:14.690 --> 00:04:18.060 align:middle line:84%
And then there's a Roman
temple on top of it.

00:04:18.060 --> 00:04:22.240 align:middle line:84%
Baalbek is in Lebanon right
near the Syrian border.

00:04:22.240 --> 00:04:27.370 align:middle line:84%
So what you have also in
Jerusalem is a similar platform,

00:04:27.370 --> 00:04:28.690 align:middle line:90%
giant blocks.

00:04:28.690 --> 00:04:30.320 align:middle line:90%
They had to cut a tunnel.

00:04:30.320 --> 00:04:34.550 align:middle line:84%
This is the Wailing Wall, the
base of King Solomon's temple.

00:04:34.550 --> 00:04:40.150 align:middle line:84%
But it also is a giant like
1,000-ton block of stone

00:04:40.150 --> 00:04:41.480 align:middle line:90%
that's perfectly fitted.

00:04:41.480 --> 00:04:43.040 align:middle line:90%
This woman is standing there.

00:04:43.040 --> 00:04:46.750 align:middle line:84%
They didn't even know this
existed until like about 15,

00:04:46.750 --> 00:04:48.700 align:middle line:90%
20 years ago.

00:04:48.700 --> 00:04:52.740 align:middle line:84%
So there are all
kinds of monoliths

00:04:52.740 --> 00:04:55.030 align:middle line:84%
and sunken cities in
the Mediterranean.

00:04:55.030 --> 00:04:59.190 align:middle line:84%
There's more than 200
known sunken cities

00:04:59.190 --> 00:05:01.060 align:middle line:90%
in the Mediterranean.

00:05:01.060 --> 00:05:05.650 align:middle line:84%
And this is a giant monolith
that was found just off Sicily.

00:05:05.650 --> 00:05:07.980 align:middle line:84%
It apparently was
like an obelisk.

00:05:07.980 --> 00:05:10.430 align:middle line:84%
It had drill holes
and stuff in it.

00:05:10.430 --> 00:05:13.450 align:middle line:84%
It's in about 100
feet of water or so.

00:05:13.450 --> 00:05:15.690 align:middle line:84%
So the idea there is
that at one point,

00:05:15.690 --> 00:05:21.420 align:middle line:84%
the Mediterranean was like a
big basin with big lakes in it.

00:05:21.420 --> 00:05:26.020 align:middle line:84%
And you have-- and there
were obelisks there, too.

00:05:26.020 --> 00:05:30.540 align:middle line:84%
This is the unfinished
obelisk at Aswan,

00:05:30.540 --> 00:05:33.430 align:middle line:84%
and this is an
aerial photo of it.

00:05:33.430 --> 00:05:38.340 align:middle line:90%
It weighs also about 1,000 tons.

00:05:38.340 --> 00:05:42.120 align:middle line:84%
How the Egyptians were
able to quarry and lift out

00:05:42.120 --> 00:05:44.160 align:middle line:84%
of the quarry and then
move these obelisks

00:05:44.160 --> 00:05:48.720 align:middle line:84%
and then erect them, we don't
know how they could do it.

00:05:48.720 --> 00:05:54.090 align:middle line:10%
The modern Egyptian
engineers can't do it today.

00:05:54.090 --> 00:05:55.780 align:middle line:10%
They are unable to.

00:05:55.780 --> 00:06:00.120 align:middle line:10%
What happened with the
unfinished obelisk?

00:06:00.120 --> 00:06:02.750 align:middle line:84%
I'll just go back
to it for a second.

00:06:02.750 --> 00:06:04.250 align:middle line:84%
As the Egyptians
were quarrying it,

00:06:04.250 --> 00:06:06.350 align:middle line:90%
or whoever was quarrying it--

00:06:06.350 --> 00:06:08.150 align:middle line:90%
could have been ancient aliens--

00:06:08.150 --> 00:06:13.470 align:middle line:84%
as a cut underneath the obelisk,
it has to be a monolith.

00:06:13.470 --> 00:06:14.970 align:middle line:90%
I mean, it can't be in pieces.

00:06:14.970 --> 00:06:18.210 align:middle line:84%
It has to be one giant
piece of granite.

00:06:18.210 --> 00:06:21.390 align:middle line:84%
Granite is infused with
tiny quartz crystals, too.

00:06:21.390 --> 00:06:26.160 align:middle line:84%
So they're ultimately like
crystal towers, the obelisks.

00:06:26.160 --> 00:06:30.770 align:middle line:84%
But as they cut underneath
the obelisk at Aswan,

00:06:30.770 --> 00:06:35.760 align:middle line:84%
they noticed there was a crack
in the rock, a natural crack

00:06:35.760 --> 00:06:38.120 align:middle line:84%
but they couldn't see
it until they started

00:06:38.120 --> 00:06:39.690 align:middle line:90%
cutting under the obelisk.

00:06:39.690 --> 00:06:43.790 align:middle line:84%
As soon as they saw that there
was a crack in the obelisk

00:06:43.790 --> 00:06:45.770 align:middle line:84%
and it wasn't going
to be perfect,

00:06:45.770 --> 00:06:48.020 align:middle line:84%
they just stopped working
on it because they

00:06:48.020 --> 00:06:49.440 align:middle line:90%
couldn't use that obelisk.

00:06:49.440 --> 00:06:51.860 align:middle line:90%
The obelisk had to be perfect.

00:06:51.860 --> 00:06:55.430 align:middle line:84%
Incredibly, there are
obelisks on the moon.

00:06:55.430 --> 00:06:57.660 align:middle line:10%
I'll talk about that later.

00:06:57.660 --> 00:07:00.470 align:middle line:10%
This is one of my books,
"Obelisk: Towers of Power."

00:07:00.470 --> 00:07:04.410 align:middle line:10%
So, yeah, your average obelisk
was weighing about 500 tons

00:07:04.410 --> 00:07:09.390 align:middle line:10%
and some obelisks weigh up
to 1,000 tons or even more.

00:07:09.390 --> 00:07:13.650 align:middle line:84%
So you get into the whole
idea of Atlantis, prehistory.

00:07:13.650 --> 00:07:17.280 align:middle line:84%
When we think of any
civilization that's prior

00:07:17.280 --> 00:07:22.430 align:middle line:84%
to about 10,000 BC or so, then
we're really talking about

00:07:22.430 --> 00:07:23.230 align:middle line:90%
Atlantis.

00:07:23.230 --> 00:07:27.150 align:middle line:84%
The story of Atlantis comes from
the Greek philosopher Plato,

00:07:27.150 --> 00:07:30.420 align:middle line:84%
who talks about his uncle going
to Egypt, where the Egyptians

00:07:30.420 --> 00:07:32.260 align:middle line:90%
tell him about Atlantis.

00:07:32.260 --> 00:07:37.240 align:middle line:84%
They tell him that the Greeks
are older than he even thinks.

00:07:37.240 --> 00:07:39.280 align:middle line:84%
And then they tell him
the story of Atlantis.

00:07:39.280 --> 00:07:44.520 align:middle line:84%
Atlantis was supposedly
an island civilization

00:07:44.520 --> 00:07:47.670 align:middle line:84%
out in the Atlantic, say,
where the Azores are today

00:07:47.670 --> 00:07:51.730 align:middle line:84%
or we're not exactly sure
where it would have been.

00:07:51.730 --> 00:07:54.870 align:middle line:84%
And it had concentric
circles and canals

00:07:54.870 --> 00:07:57.010 align:middle line:90%
going into a center city.

00:07:57.010 --> 00:07:58.780 align:middle line:84%
There were huge pyramids
and stuff there.

00:07:58.780 --> 00:08:00.220 align:middle line:90%
So that's the story of Atlantis.

00:08:00.220 --> 00:08:03.230 align:middle line:84%
And I've always been
interested in Atlantis.

00:08:03.230 --> 00:08:06.680 align:middle line:84%
In the Pacific, too, you have
stories of Lemuria and Mu,

00:08:06.680 --> 00:08:09.560 align:middle line:84%
the land of Mu, and
this land that's

00:08:09.560 --> 00:08:14.910 align:middle line:84%
connected to the southern
tip of India and Australia.

00:08:14.910 --> 00:08:18.200 align:middle line:84%
So Kumari Kandam, this
is what they call it

00:08:18.200 --> 00:08:19.650 align:middle line:90%
in the Tamil language.

00:08:19.650 --> 00:08:21.800 align:middle line:84%
So in India, too, they
believe that there's

00:08:21.800 --> 00:08:26.690 align:middle line:84%
this lost continents, lost
lands that they're all part of.

00:08:26.690 --> 00:08:29.600 align:middle line:84%
So let's now go
to Peru and we'll

00:08:29.600 --> 00:08:33.570 align:middle line:84%
go to Ollantaytambo, one of
my favorite places in Peru.

00:08:33.570 --> 00:08:36.090 align:middle line:84%
This is at the end
of the Sacred Valley.

00:08:36.090 --> 00:08:38.600 align:middle line:84%
This is on the way
to Machu Picchu,

00:08:38.600 --> 00:08:41.520 align:middle line:84%
and it has some very,
very curious megaliths.

00:08:41.520 --> 00:08:42.539 align:middle line:90%
You see these ones here.

00:08:42.539 --> 00:08:47.180 align:middle line:84%
There are also giant blocks
of granite, perfectly fitted

00:08:47.180 --> 00:08:50.340 align:middle line:90%
and cut, fitted together.

00:08:50.340 --> 00:08:52.140 align:middle line:90%
That's the sun temple up there.

00:08:52.140 --> 00:08:55.580 align:middle line:84%
But what you see as you
walk around Ollantaytambo,

00:08:55.580 --> 00:08:58.970 align:middle line:84%
and it's actually on
a hill above a cliff,

00:08:58.970 --> 00:09:01.310 align:middle line:84%
you see these giant
blocks like this

00:09:01.310 --> 00:09:05.850 align:middle line:84%
and they're scattered
around like some kid's toy

00:09:05.850 --> 00:09:07.390 align:middle line:90%
blocks or something.

00:09:07.390 --> 00:09:13.000 align:middle line:84%
But these blocks are weighing
probably 200 to 300 tons each.

00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:15.930 align:middle line:90%
And the thing is this--

00:09:15.930 --> 00:09:17.800 align:middle line:90%
this is how it looks today.

00:09:17.800 --> 00:09:20.410 align:middle line:84%
And this is how it looked
in Inca times, too,

00:09:20.410 --> 00:09:22.500 align:middle line:84%
and when the Spanish
conquered Peru.

00:09:22.500 --> 00:09:24.270 align:middle line:90%
It looked just like this.

00:09:24.270 --> 00:09:29.750 align:middle line:84%
And even you have these crummy
little blocks of stone that

00:09:29.750 --> 00:09:31.360 align:middle line:90%
are underneath them and stuff.

00:09:31.360 --> 00:09:34.510 align:middle line:84%
So this place had
already been destroyed.

00:09:34.510 --> 00:09:37.890 align:middle line:10%
And what archeologists try
to say is that, oh well,

00:09:37.890 --> 00:09:40.390 align:middle line:10%
they just never finished
building this thing.

00:09:40.390 --> 00:09:42.400 align:middle line:10%
But it's so gigantically huge.

00:09:42.400 --> 00:09:44.050 align:middle line:84%
And then you have
these things here.

00:09:44.050 --> 00:09:46.560 align:middle line:84%
These are called
keystone cuts and they're

00:09:46.560 --> 00:09:49.300 align:middle line:90%
in T-shapes or hourglass shapes.

00:09:49.300 --> 00:09:52.540 align:middle line:84%
And there's always going to be
another one on the other side.

00:09:52.540 --> 00:09:54.360 align:middle line:84%
So you have another
block and then

00:09:54.360 --> 00:09:58.950 align:middle line:84%
you pour molten metals into this
and you create a metal clamp

00:09:58.950 --> 00:10:01.540 align:middle line:90%
that's spanning two blocks.

00:10:01.540 --> 00:10:03.850 align:middle line:84%
And you see this
at Ollantaytambo.

00:10:03.850 --> 00:10:07.500 align:middle line:84%
You also see it at the
sun temple in Cusco.

00:10:07.500 --> 00:10:10.530 align:middle line:84%
But this is also-- this
is indicative of what

00:10:10.530 --> 00:10:14.590 align:middle line:84%
you see at Tiwanaku and
Pumapunku are these clamps.

00:10:14.590 --> 00:10:18.630 align:middle line:84%
And you see this also in
Egypt, you see it in Indonesia,

00:10:18.630 --> 00:10:21.480 align:middle line:84%
you see it in Vietnam,
you see it in Greece,

00:10:21.480 --> 00:10:24.300 align:middle line:84%
you see it in other
places too, in Morocco.

00:10:24.300 --> 00:10:27.690 align:middle line:84%
And this is an unusual
way of fitting blocks

00:10:27.690 --> 00:10:33.700 align:middle line:84%
together and then pouring
molten metals into it.

00:10:33.700 --> 00:10:36.240 align:middle line:10%
And the idea that people
in different continents

00:10:36.240 --> 00:10:38.760 align:middle line:10%
all around the world would
start building like this

00:10:38.760 --> 00:10:40.990 align:middle line:10%
is almost impossible.

00:10:40.990 --> 00:10:45.150 align:middle line:10%
So this shows that the same
people who are building in Peru

00:10:45.150 --> 00:10:47.500 align:middle line:10%
are the same ones
building in Egypt.

00:10:47.500 --> 00:10:51.450 align:middle line:84%
They have these keystone cuts
in Egypt too, and in India,

00:10:51.450 --> 00:10:54.408 align:middle line:84%
and Indonesia, Vietnam, other
places around the world.

00:10:54.408 --> 00:10:55.950 align:middle line:84%
What's interesting
here, I don't know

00:10:55.950 --> 00:10:57.810 align:middle line:84%
if you can really see
it very carefully,

00:10:57.810 --> 00:11:02.590 align:middle line:84%
but in the upper side here is a
keystone cut on this big block.

00:11:02.590 --> 00:11:07.750 align:middle line:84%
And then you have this crummy
sort of blocks filling it in.

00:11:07.750 --> 00:11:10.130 align:middle line:90%
And so this shouldn't be here.

00:11:10.130 --> 00:11:13.430 align:middle line:84%
I mean, this has to be on a
horizontal plane, not on this.

00:11:13.430 --> 00:11:16.420 align:middle line:84%
So this shows that this
block, and it's a giant block,

00:11:16.420 --> 00:11:17.780 align:middle line:90%
isn't in the right place.

00:11:17.780 --> 00:11:19.910 align:middle line:84%
Somebody's put it
in the wrong place.

00:11:19.910 --> 00:11:21.910 align:middle line:84%
As you walk up the
stairs, you also

00:11:21.910 --> 00:11:24.890 align:middle line:84%
see there are stairs
going up at Ollantaytambo.

00:11:24.890 --> 00:11:27.680 align:middle line:90%
You see the polygonal masonry.

00:11:27.680 --> 00:11:29.810 align:middle line:90%
It's perfectly fitted together.

00:11:29.810 --> 00:11:31.173 align:middle line:90%
You have these strange knobs.

00:11:31.173 --> 00:11:33.340 align:middle line:84%
They're not sure what those
are for-- the big lichen

00:11:33.340 --> 00:11:37.180 align:middle line:84%
patches that also shows
that it's very old.

00:11:37.180 --> 00:11:38.660 align:middle line:90%
Here's Machu Picchu.

00:11:38.660 --> 00:11:40.610 align:middle line:90%
Machu Picchu is a secret city.

00:11:40.610 --> 00:11:43.750 align:middle line:84%
It's a megalithic city
on top of a mountain.

00:11:43.750 --> 00:11:46.580 align:middle line:84%
The Spanish never knew
that it was there.

00:11:46.580 --> 00:11:47.780 align:middle line:90%
It's got the sun temple.

00:11:47.780 --> 00:11:50.360 align:middle line:84%
It's magnificently
beautiful site.

00:11:50.360 --> 00:11:53.050 align:middle line:84%
It's the most
popular tourist spot

00:11:53.050 --> 00:11:55.660 align:middle line:84%
in all of South America
for good reason.

00:11:55.660 --> 00:11:59.260 align:middle line:84%
And there's another city that's
almost identical to Machu

00:11:59.260 --> 00:12:01.540 align:middle line:90%
Picchu in Cambodia.

00:12:01.540 --> 00:12:05.550 align:middle line:84%
It's called Preah Vihear, and it
also has a famous three windows.

00:12:05.550 --> 00:12:09.530 align:middle line:84%
It's also on top of cliffs,
on top of a mountain.

00:12:09.530 --> 00:12:11.720 align:middle line:90%
Now, as you go into--

00:12:11.720 --> 00:12:16.640 align:middle line:84%
as you go south of Cusco and
Ollantaytambo in that area,

00:12:16.640 --> 00:12:18.180 align:middle line:90%
you come to Lake Titicaca.

00:12:18.180 --> 00:12:23.010 align:middle line:84%
This is a satellite
photo of Lake Titicaca.

00:12:23.010 --> 00:12:27.240 align:middle line:10%
Lake Titicaca is about
13,000 feet in the Andes.

00:12:27.240 --> 00:12:30.060 align:middle line:10%
About half of Lake
Titicaca is in Peru.

00:12:30.060 --> 00:12:32.510 align:middle line:10%
The other half is in Bolivia.

00:12:32.510 --> 00:12:35.840 align:middle line:90%
UFOs come up out of the lake.

00:12:35.840 --> 00:12:39.140 align:middle line:84%
It's very famous for
that UFO activity.

00:12:39.140 --> 00:12:41.400 align:middle line:84%
It's the highest navigable
lake in the world.

00:12:41.400 --> 00:12:43.720 align:middle line:90%
This northern part up here.

00:12:43.720 --> 00:12:47.370 align:middle line:84%
Well, yeah, it's the northern
part at the top of the picture.

00:12:47.370 --> 00:12:49.560 align:middle line:84%
The water is very
deep there in places.

00:12:49.560 --> 00:12:51.680 align:middle line:90%
It's about 900 deep.

00:12:51.680 --> 00:12:56.270 align:middle line:84%
In this southern part of the
lake down here at the bottom,

00:12:56.270 --> 00:12:57.720 align:middle line:90%
it's much more shallow.

00:12:57.720 --> 00:12:59.780 align:middle line:84%
And they say that
there are sunken cities

00:12:59.780 --> 00:13:01.760 align:middle line:90%
and ruins in this area.

00:13:01.760 --> 00:13:04.710 align:middle line:90%
The UFOs come out of areas here.

00:13:04.710 --> 00:13:06.380 align:middle line:90%
There's Island of the Sun.

00:13:06.380 --> 00:13:09.530 align:middle line:84%
So Lake Titicaca
is very mysterious.

00:13:09.530 --> 00:13:15.140 align:middle line:84%
There's an incredibly, in Lake
Titicaca, there are seahorses.

00:13:15.140 --> 00:13:21.470 align:middle line:10%
Seahorses live normally
in tropical ocean reefs

00:13:21.470 --> 00:13:23.840 align:middle line:10%
like or around
Indonesia or Tahiti

00:13:23.840 --> 00:13:27.710 align:middle line:10%
and stuff like that, kind
of shallow, warm coral reefs

00:13:27.710 --> 00:13:28.640 align:middle line:10%
and stuff.

00:13:28.640 --> 00:13:33.800 align:middle line:10%
How seahorses would be at
13,000 feet in the Andes,

00:13:33.800 --> 00:13:36.800 align:middle line:10%
they can't explain that,
and would indicate that,

00:13:36.800 --> 00:13:39.720 align:middle line:10%
at one time, Lake
Titicaca was at sea level.

00:13:39.720 --> 00:13:42.600 align:middle line:84%
Today it's 13,000
feet in the Andes.

00:13:42.600 --> 00:13:43.980 align:middle line:90%
Here's a-- they're diving.

00:13:43.980 --> 00:13:47.610 align:middle line:84%
There are ruins, underwater
ruins in Lake Titicaca.

00:13:47.610 --> 00:13:51.920 align:middle line:10%
They know that Jacques Cousteau
did a famous dive there

00:13:51.920 --> 00:13:53.840 align:middle line:10%
and stuff, too.

00:13:53.840 --> 00:13:58.153 align:middle line:10%
This is the Mauk'allaqta
Chullpa in Espinar province.

00:13:58.153 --> 00:13:59.570 align:middle line:84%
And this kind of
shows you, again,

00:13:59.570 --> 00:14:02.150 align:middle line:84%
where you have Inca
construction, which

00:14:02.150 --> 00:14:05.540 align:middle line:84%
is this sort of crummy
construction here.

00:14:05.540 --> 00:14:08.520 align:middle line:84%
But then you have construction
that's megalithic and perfectly

00:14:08.520 --> 00:14:09.320 align:middle line:90%
fitted.

00:14:09.320 --> 00:14:11.050 align:middle line:10%
I mean, this thing
would be impossible

00:14:11.050 --> 00:14:14.140 align:middle line:10%
for a modern
construction crew in Peru

00:14:14.140 --> 00:14:16.960 align:middle line:10%
to make today, these kind of
mushroom towers and things

00:14:16.960 --> 00:14:17.810 align:middle line:10%
like that.

00:14:17.810 --> 00:14:19.700 align:middle line:84%
And there's a bunch
of them around Peru.

00:14:19.700 --> 00:14:22.820 align:middle line:84%
This is all sort of
around Lake Titicaca.

00:14:22.820 --> 00:14:24.080 align:middle line:90%
This is Cutimbo.

00:14:24.080 --> 00:14:29.450 align:middle line:84%
Cutimbo is just to the
west side of Lake Titicaca,

00:14:29.450 --> 00:14:31.790 align:middle line:90%
and it's on top of this mesa.

00:14:31.790 --> 00:14:34.460 align:middle line:84%
You have to climb up
and hike up to the top.

00:14:34.460 --> 00:14:37.420 align:middle line:84%
And when you get up there,
there are more towers.

00:14:37.420 --> 00:14:40.060 align:middle line:84%
There are square
towers and round

00:14:40.060 --> 00:14:41.860 align:middle line:90%
towers, the ruins of things.

00:14:41.860 --> 00:14:45.940 align:middle line:84%
They're megalithic, they're
perfectly fitted granite towers

00:14:45.940 --> 00:14:46.820 align:middle line:90%
and things.

00:14:46.820 --> 00:14:53.950 align:middle line:84%
And what you see on some of
them is snakes in relief.

00:14:53.950 --> 00:14:57.010 align:middle line:84%
So that means that they've
cut the stone all around it

00:14:57.010 --> 00:14:58.850 align:middle line:90%
to leave these snakes.

00:14:58.850 --> 00:15:00.080 align:middle line:90%
There are snakes here.

00:15:00.080 --> 00:15:03.040 align:middle line:84%
There's another
snake over there.

00:15:03.040 --> 00:15:06.050 align:middle line:84%
Here's another snake here
on one of the blocks.

00:15:06.050 --> 00:15:07.730 align:middle line:84%
In Cusco, there are
some places, too,

00:15:07.730 --> 00:15:13.580 align:middle line:84%
where you see these snakes
that are cut into the rock.

00:15:13.580 --> 00:15:17.240 align:middle line:84%
This is also--
there's another tower

00:15:17.240 --> 00:15:19.820 align:middle line:90%
area there called Sillustani.

00:15:19.820 --> 00:15:21.120 align:middle line:90%
There's lakes there.

00:15:21.120 --> 00:15:23.420 align:middle line:84%
This is also just to the
west of Lake Titicaca.

00:15:23.420 --> 00:15:26.190 align:middle line:84%
So it's another lake
but it's smaller.

00:15:26.190 --> 00:15:30.420 align:middle line:84%
And this island in the
middle of it is also flat.

00:15:30.420 --> 00:15:33.050 align:middle line:84%
And they say that UFOs
come up out of this lake,

00:15:33.050 --> 00:15:36.000 align:middle line:90%
and it's a very active UFO area.

00:15:36.000 --> 00:15:38.070 align:middle line:90%
There are towers and stuff here.

00:15:38.070 --> 00:15:39.420 align:middle line:90%
This is at Sillustani.

00:15:39.420 --> 00:15:44.660 align:middle line:84%
You can see the snake that's
going there up at the top.

00:15:44.660 --> 00:15:47.580 align:middle line:90%
So here's what's interesting.

00:15:47.580 --> 00:15:50.780 align:middle line:84%
The Yazidis in
Northern Iraq, this

00:15:50.780 --> 00:15:53.150 align:middle line:84%
is one of the oldest
religions in the world,

00:15:53.150 --> 00:15:57.300 align:middle line:84%
and they are really the
heirs of the Sumerians.

00:15:57.300 --> 00:15:59.510 align:middle line:10%
And what they have
on their temples

00:15:59.510 --> 00:16:03.900 align:middle line:10%
is the snakes, the
same kind of snakes

00:16:03.900 --> 00:16:06.550 align:middle line:10%
that we're seeing in Peru.

00:16:06.550 --> 00:16:09.270 align:middle line:84%
And so here's one
of those temples.

00:16:09.270 --> 00:16:10.780 align:middle line:90%
These are up in Mosul.

00:16:10.780 --> 00:16:15.070 align:middle line:84%
It's a very northern part of
Iraq where the Yazidis live.

00:16:15.070 --> 00:16:18.730 align:middle line:84%
See the snake there on the side,
that's also cut into the rocks.

00:16:18.730 --> 00:16:23.170 align:middle line:84%
So here we have this Sumerian
stuff that's happening.

00:16:23.170 --> 00:16:27.520 align:middle line:84%
But it's not just in Northern
Iraq and Sumerian stuff,

00:16:27.520 --> 00:16:29.820 align:middle line:90%
it's also in Peru.

00:16:29.820 --> 00:16:34.500 align:middle line:84%
So just south of Lake
Titicaca is Tiwanaku.

00:16:34.500 --> 00:16:37.880 align:middle line:84%
And Tiwanaku is a
megalithic city.

00:16:37.880 --> 00:16:40.660 align:middle line:90%
It's absolutely pre-Inca.

00:16:40.660 --> 00:16:43.380 align:middle line:90%
They know that.

00:16:43.380 --> 00:16:46.530 align:middle line:84%
And one of the
features at Tiwanaku

00:16:46.530 --> 00:16:49.120 align:middle line:90%
are these monolithic doors.

00:16:49.120 --> 00:16:50.790 align:middle line:84%
So they're monolithic
in the sense

00:16:50.790 --> 00:16:55.320 align:middle line:84%
that the door is, this is
all one giant slab of granite

00:16:55.320 --> 00:16:57.310 align:middle line:90%
and a door is cut into it.

00:16:57.310 --> 00:17:00.820 align:middle line:84%
It's been cracked and
split by an earthquake.

00:17:00.820 --> 00:17:03.820 align:middle line:84%
You can see on the side
here, these notches,

00:17:03.820 --> 00:17:07.040 align:middle line:84%
so this was wasn't meant
to just stand by itself.

00:17:07.040 --> 00:17:11.260 align:middle line:84%
It's part of some giant
building that was destroyed.

00:17:11.260 --> 00:17:15.250 align:middle line:84%
So what you have in the middle
of the gate is the sun god,

00:17:15.250 --> 00:17:17.060 align:middle line:90%
they say Viracocha.

00:17:17.060 --> 00:17:18.440 align:middle line:90%
He's standing there.

00:17:18.440 --> 00:17:24.020 align:middle line:10%
He's got staffs on either
side and he's crying.

00:17:24.020 --> 00:17:27.520 align:middle line:10%
He's got tears coming
down each cheek.

00:17:27.520 --> 00:17:32.090 align:middle line:10%
And what this is, they called
them the tears of the sun.

00:17:32.090 --> 00:17:37.480 align:middle line:84%
And what I believe it is,
the tears, it's molten gold.

00:17:37.480 --> 00:17:41.560 align:middle line:84%
And Tiwanaku and
Pumapunku were apparently

00:17:41.560 --> 00:17:44.770 align:middle line:84%
a huge metallurgical
plant that was processing

00:17:44.770 --> 00:17:49.390 align:middle line:84%
metals, gold, silver,
tin, bronze, copper,

00:17:49.390 --> 00:17:50.570 align:middle line:90%
and stuff like that.

00:17:50.570 --> 00:17:52.510 align:middle line:10%
Now what's interesting,
too, is that

00:17:52.510 --> 00:17:56.680 align:middle line:10%
on either side of him running--

00:17:56.680 --> 00:17:59.830 align:middle line:10%
and they're running toward
him from either side,

00:17:59.830 --> 00:18:03.730 align:middle line:10%
are these birdmen, these
guys, and they're also

00:18:03.730 --> 00:18:05.150 align:middle line:10%
holding staffs and things.

00:18:05.150 --> 00:18:08.740 align:middle line:84%
They have wings, they're
birdmen, they can fly.

00:18:08.740 --> 00:18:12.590 align:middle line:84%
And he's got a feathered
headdress and stuff like that.

00:18:12.590 --> 00:18:13.850 align:middle line:90%
So here are the birdmen.

00:18:13.850 --> 00:18:17.290 align:middle line:84%
They fly, they're
at Tiwanaku, they're

00:18:17.290 --> 00:18:20.720 align:middle line:90%
processing metals and gold.

00:18:20.720 --> 00:18:25.220 align:middle line:84%
The Tiwanaku was like
wallpapered with sheets of gold.

00:18:25.220 --> 00:18:27.530 align:middle line:84%
And that's what a lot of
the little drill holes are.

00:18:27.530 --> 00:18:31.150 align:middle line:84%
They were to hold pins that
hold these gold sheets.

00:18:31.150 --> 00:18:34.660 align:middle line:10%
Some archeologists
have speculated

00:18:34.660 --> 00:18:38.710 align:middle line:10%
that the story of Jason
and the golden fleece

00:18:38.710 --> 00:18:43.240 align:middle line:10%
is a story of the Greeks
going to South America,

00:18:43.240 --> 00:18:46.000 align:middle line:10%
going up the Rio de la
Plata, which was there

00:18:46.000 --> 00:18:51.280 align:middle line:10%
by north of Buenos Aires, and up
into Bolivia, and to Tiwanaku.

00:18:51.280 --> 00:18:55.370 align:middle line:10%
This is a Jade Olmec
Birdman from Costa Rica.

00:18:55.370 --> 00:18:57.320 align:middle line:10%
So he's one of
these birdmen, too.

00:18:57.320 --> 00:18:58.280 align:middle line:10%
He's got wings.

00:18:58.280 --> 00:19:00.170 align:middle line:10%
He's got the elongated head.

00:19:00.170 --> 00:19:02.720 align:middle line:10%
He can fly.

00:19:02.720 --> 00:19:05.840 align:middle line:90%
So we'll go here to Pumapunku.

00:19:05.840 --> 00:19:10.970 align:middle line:84%
This is giant slabs
of sandstone, there.

00:19:10.970 --> 00:19:12.900 align:middle line:90%
It's been completely destroyed.

00:19:12.900 --> 00:19:15.040 align:middle line:90%
They're digging it up right now.

00:19:15.040 --> 00:19:16.940 align:middle line:90%
They're trenching it.

00:19:16.940 --> 00:19:22.050 align:middle line:84%
Certain areas, they
rope off to tourists.

00:19:22.050 --> 00:19:25.510 align:middle line:84%
But I've been able to
go all over Pumapunku.

00:19:25.510 --> 00:19:27.600 align:middle line:84%
You have-- they are
trenching it there.

00:19:27.600 --> 00:19:28.850 align:middle line:90%
This is what archeologists do.

00:19:28.850 --> 00:19:32.250 align:middle line:84%
They dig these trenches to see,
just find out what's there.

00:19:32.250 --> 00:19:35.790 align:middle line:84%
And there, they find
also blocks of stone.

00:19:35.790 --> 00:19:38.330 align:middle line:84%
And here are those
keystone cuts again

00:19:38.330 --> 00:19:41.480 align:middle line:84%
that we were looking at
before at Ollantaytambo,

00:19:41.480 --> 00:19:45.560 align:middle line:84%
where the molten metals are
poured into these blocks

00:19:45.560 --> 00:19:48.080 align:middle line:90%
to hold them together.

00:19:48.080 --> 00:19:50.340 align:middle line:84%
So here are some more
of these keystone cuts.

00:19:50.340 --> 00:19:54.850 align:middle line:84%
They're on the giant sandstone
slabs that weigh about 75 tons.

00:19:54.850 --> 00:19:55.650 align:middle line:90%
They're beneath.

00:19:55.650 --> 00:19:58.880 align:middle line:84%
And these are big keystone
cuts, so the metal clamps

00:19:58.880 --> 00:20:01.680 align:middle line:84%
going into them would
be really quite heavy.

00:20:01.680 --> 00:20:03.900 align:middle line:84%
Here are some of the
clamps, what they look like.

00:20:03.900 --> 00:20:05.070 align:middle line:90%
They're bronze.

00:20:05.070 --> 00:20:07.520 align:middle line:84%
So they're a mixture
of copper and tin.

00:20:07.520 --> 00:20:11.900 align:middle line:84%
They're in the museum,
they're at Tiwanaku.

00:20:11.900 --> 00:20:17.160 align:middle line:84%
So now let's go to
Vietnam, to My Son.

00:20:17.160 --> 00:20:19.260 align:middle line:90%
This is a city near Da Nang.

00:20:19.260 --> 00:20:21.860 align:middle line:84%
And it has to do with the
Cham people, the Champa

00:20:21.860 --> 00:20:23.750 align:middle line:90%
people who were the early--

00:20:23.750 --> 00:20:26.570 align:middle line:84%
they were the real
original inhabitants

00:20:26.570 --> 00:20:30.760 align:middle line:84%
of Vietnam and Cambodia and
of Laos and even Thailand

00:20:30.760 --> 00:20:31.560 align:middle line:90%
and that area.

00:20:31.560 --> 00:20:35.250 align:middle line:84%
They were called the
Cham, C-H-A-M or Cham.

00:20:35.250 --> 00:20:37.820 align:middle line:84%
And that is also the
ancient word for Egypt,

00:20:37.820 --> 00:20:39.780 align:middle line:90%
is Cham or Kemet.

00:20:39.780 --> 00:20:44.240 align:middle line:84%
So we're almost-- they're like
using the same word for them

00:20:44.240 --> 00:20:46.400 align:middle line:84%
as they did in
Egypt as the Cham.

00:20:46.400 --> 00:20:48.720 align:middle line:10%
And the keystone
cuts are there, too,

00:20:48.720 --> 00:20:52.260 align:middle line:10%
and they're cutting stones out
of basalt. So what you need

00:20:52.260 --> 00:20:54.580 align:middle line:10%
is power tools to do this.

00:20:54.580 --> 00:20:59.610 align:middle line:10%
You need diamond drills,
diamond saws, diamond grinders

00:20:59.610 --> 00:21:03.130 align:middle line:10%
and things, the same kind of
power tools we have today.

00:21:03.130 --> 00:21:06.660 align:middle line:84%
That's what you need
to cut these things.

00:21:06.660 --> 00:21:10.270 align:middle line:84%
Now, we're back at
Tiwanaku and Pumapunku.

00:21:10.270 --> 00:21:11.740 align:middle line:90%
These are the H blocks there.

00:21:11.740 --> 00:21:13.960 align:middle line:90%
They've got also the clamps.

00:21:13.960 --> 00:21:18.010 align:middle line:84%
This is a mural at the
museum in Tiwanaku.

00:21:18.010 --> 00:21:24.570 align:middle line:84%
So here you have these perfectly
cut H-blocks and stuff.

00:21:24.570 --> 00:21:25.850 align:middle line:90%
And they're granite.

00:21:25.850 --> 00:21:26.650 align:middle line:90%
They're very hard.

00:21:26.650 --> 00:21:29.830 align:middle line:84%
You will need power tools
to cut them, these guys.

00:21:29.830 --> 00:21:32.230 align:middle line:90%
But this is totally anomalistic.

00:21:32.230 --> 00:21:35.520 align:middle line:84%
I mean, here, he's
got a little campfire,

00:21:35.520 --> 00:21:37.630 align:middle line:90%
they're wearing these tunics.

00:21:37.630 --> 00:21:41.880 align:middle line:84%
But what they're doing is
so incredibly sophisticated

00:21:41.880 --> 00:21:44.800 align:middle line:84%
that archeologists
can't explain it.

00:21:44.800 --> 00:21:47.280 align:middle line:90%
And they can't do this either.

00:21:47.280 --> 00:21:51.540 align:middle line:84%
But they've got these
primitive guys doing this,

00:21:51.540 --> 00:21:52.870 align:middle line:90%
and it's impossible.

00:21:52.870 --> 00:21:56.360 align:middle line:84%
I mean, this is
ridiculous, really.

00:21:56.360 --> 00:22:01.950 align:middle line:84%
There is a pyramid to the west
of Tiwanaku and Pumapunku.

00:22:01.950 --> 00:22:03.110 align:middle line:90%
Here it is.

00:22:03.110 --> 00:22:05.580 align:middle line:84%
I had to take this
with a telephoto lens.

00:22:05.580 --> 00:22:07.980 align:middle line:90%
This village is excavating it.

00:22:07.980 --> 00:22:10.410 align:middle line:84%
They won't allow
tourists to go there.

00:22:10.410 --> 00:22:13.820 align:middle line:84%
And the villagers themselves
are excavating it.

00:22:13.820 --> 00:22:15.500 align:middle line:90%
Not the Bolivian government.

00:22:15.500 --> 00:22:16.880 align:middle line:90%
They've taken control of it.

00:22:16.880 --> 00:22:19.140 align:middle line:84%
And they're finding
artifacts and things in it.

00:22:19.140 --> 00:22:21.240 align:middle line:84%
And one of those
artifacts is this.

00:22:21.240 --> 00:22:24.470 align:middle line:84%
It's called the
Fuente Magna Bowl.

00:22:24.470 --> 00:22:28.260 align:middle line:90%
And it's a large ceramic bowl.

00:22:28.260 --> 00:22:30.840 align:middle line:84%
It was found in that
pyramid in 1960.

00:22:30.840 --> 00:22:34.490 align:middle line:84%
It was kept in the museum
and it wasn't put on display

00:22:34.490 --> 00:22:38.100 align:middle line:90%
until about 2005 or so.

00:22:38.100 --> 00:22:43.170 align:middle line:84%
So today, this is in the main
archeological museum in La Paz.

00:22:43.170 --> 00:22:47.310 align:middle line:84%
They call it the Gold Museum
or the Archeological Museum.

00:22:47.310 --> 00:22:50.520 align:middle line:84%
Now, what is on this
bowl is incredible.

00:22:50.520 --> 00:22:54.990 align:middle line:84%
It has two types of
Sumerian writing on it.

00:22:54.990 --> 00:22:57.930 align:middle line:84%
It has Sumerian
cuneiform on the left,

00:22:57.930 --> 00:23:01.090 align:middle line:84%
and on the right is
Sumerian hieroglyphs.

00:23:01.090 --> 00:23:05.430 align:middle line:84%
The Sumerians wrote in both
hieroglyphs and in cuneiform.

00:23:05.430 --> 00:23:08.880 align:middle line:84%
And it's apparently
a libation to what

00:23:08.880 --> 00:23:11.980 align:middle line:84%
it says to Sumerian gods
and things like that.

00:23:11.980 --> 00:23:12.880 align:middle line:90%
That's my friend.

00:23:12.880 --> 00:23:15.330 align:middle line:90%
I took this photo.

00:23:15.330 --> 00:23:18.780 align:middle line:84%
That's my friend Christopher
Dunn standing behind it.

00:23:18.780 --> 00:23:22.710 align:middle line:84%
They tell you not to take
photos of it when you're there,

00:23:22.710 --> 00:23:26.640 align:middle line:84%
but I whipped out
my camera and...

00:23:26.640 --> 00:23:28.720 align:middle line:90%
So this is incredible.

00:23:28.720 --> 00:23:33.510 align:middle line:84%
I mean, this is proof that
the Sumerians and the Anunnaki

00:23:33.510 --> 00:23:37.840 align:middle line:90%
were in Peru and in Bolivia.

00:23:37.840 --> 00:23:40.890 align:middle line:10%
And this is, I mean,
this is a time bomb.

00:23:40.890 --> 00:23:45.650 align:middle line:84%
This totally changes the history
of South America completely.

00:23:45.650 --> 00:23:50.200 align:middle line:84%
And this is in the
main museum in La Paz.

00:23:50.200 --> 00:23:52.370 align:middle line:84%
Archeologists don't
want to touch this.

00:23:52.370 --> 00:23:54.050 align:middle line:90%
All they can do is ignore it.

00:23:54.050 --> 00:23:57.760 align:middle line:84%
You would think that National
Geographic or somebody would do

00:23:57.760 --> 00:24:01.720 align:middle line:84%
a whole documentary or
something on TV about this,

00:24:01.720 --> 00:24:02.960 align:middle line:90%
but they don't.

00:24:02.960 --> 00:24:05.060 align:middle line:84%
They just pretend
it's not there.

00:24:05.060 --> 00:24:08.650 align:middle line:84%
And they only show that I'm
aware of that as featured this

00:24:08.650 --> 00:24:10.800 align:middle line:90%
is "Ancient Aliens."

00:24:10.800 --> 00:24:14.970 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it totally changes
the history of South America.

00:24:14.970 --> 00:24:19.810 align:middle line:84%
So there's another artifact
there, too, the Pokotia statue.

00:24:19.810 --> 00:24:21.670 align:middle line:84%
It's a granite
statue, was split.

00:24:21.670 --> 00:24:24.170 align:middle line:84%
It also has Sumerian
writing on it.

00:24:24.170 --> 00:24:26.490 align:middle line:10%
It's on his thigh there.

00:24:26.490 --> 00:24:30.220 align:middle line:84%
So let's look here at
the H blocks themselves.

00:24:30.220 --> 00:24:31.730 align:middle line:90%
They're andesite.

00:24:31.730 --> 00:24:32.920 align:middle line:90%
Very hard granite.

00:24:32.920 --> 00:24:37.100 align:middle line:84%
They're cut in these very
articulated H blocks.

00:24:37.100 --> 00:24:40.110 align:middle line:84%
They fit together
like LEGO blocks,

00:24:40.110 --> 00:24:42.520 align:middle line:90%
and it's very hard to make.

00:24:42.520 --> 00:24:46.320 align:middle line:84%
Again, you need power tools,
diamond saws, diamond grinders,

00:24:46.320 --> 00:24:48.460 align:middle line:84%
diamond drills to
make this stuff.

00:24:48.460 --> 00:24:54.060 align:middle line:84%
It's like some vimana or
giant airship just landed

00:24:54.060 --> 00:24:59.430 align:middle line:84%
there, the Altiplano of Bolivia
and had like a whole machine

00:24:59.430 --> 00:25:01.000 align:middle line:90%
shop inside it.

00:25:01.000 --> 00:25:03.960 align:middle line:84%
And with CAD
programs that were--

00:25:03.960 --> 00:25:06.300 align:middle line:84%
and they were
cutting these blocks

00:25:06.300 --> 00:25:07.780 align:middle line:90%
and they were very uniform.

00:25:07.780 --> 00:25:09.900 align:middle line:84%
And when the blocks
came out, they

00:25:09.900 --> 00:25:13.360 align:middle line:84%
would fit together into
these walls and stuff.

00:25:13.360 --> 00:25:17.030 align:middle line:84%
So this is a diagram of what
these H blocks look like.

00:25:17.030 --> 00:25:21.200 align:middle line:84%
All this articulation and
stuff is on the inside.

00:25:21.200 --> 00:25:23.030 align:middle line:90%
Extremely difficult to do.

00:25:23.030 --> 00:25:26.510 align:middle line:84%
You can't bash these out with
a stone hammer in your hand.

00:25:26.510 --> 00:25:29.140 align:middle line:84%
You can't do it with a
copper chisel either.

00:25:29.140 --> 00:25:31.940 align:middle line:90%
You need power tools to do this.

00:25:31.940 --> 00:25:37.100 align:middle line:84%
So this is what the blocks look
like and how they fit together.

00:25:37.100 --> 00:25:40.420 align:middle line:84%
It's an animation I got
from Erich von Däniken.

00:25:40.420 --> 00:25:43.310 align:middle line:90%
So you see how the blocks are.

00:25:43.310 --> 00:25:44.570 align:middle line:90%
They're uniform.

00:25:44.570 --> 00:25:48.160 align:middle line:84%
Then they slide
together, they fit in.

00:25:48.160 --> 00:25:52.570 align:middle line:84%
So this is all very
specialized and pre-programmed.

00:25:52.570 --> 00:25:58.150 align:middle line:10%
I mean, whoever is devising
this, I mean, they are geniuses,

00:25:58.150 --> 00:26:01.250 align:middle line:10%
beyond anything
that we do today.

00:26:01.250 --> 00:26:07.630 align:middle line:84%
So they come together and they
fit into these giant walls and--

00:26:07.630 --> 00:26:10.910 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it's astonishing
what they've done here.

00:26:10.910 --> 00:26:12.530 align:middle line:90%
It's really something.

00:26:12.530 --> 00:26:19.540 align:middle line:84%
It's just-- the more you look
at it, the more amazing it gets.

00:26:19.540 --> 00:26:21.110 align:middle line:90%
So all right.

00:26:21.110 --> 00:26:23.760 align:middle line:90%
Now let's go to--

00:26:23.760 --> 00:26:24.748 align:middle line:90%
let's go to Egypt.

00:26:24.748 --> 00:26:25.790 align:middle line:90%
We'll go to the Serapeum.

00:26:25.790 --> 00:26:28.100 align:middle line:84%
In fact, here's Christopher
Dunn, my friend.

00:26:28.100 --> 00:26:31.520 align:middle line:84%
He's a British-American
engineer.

00:26:31.520 --> 00:26:33.240 align:middle line:90%
He wrote the "Giza Power Plant."

00:26:33.240 --> 00:26:36.950 align:middle line:90%
So the Serapeum is near Saqqara.

00:26:36.950 --> 00:26:38.150 align:middle line:90%
It's underground.

00:26:38.150 --> 00:26:42.260 align:middle line:10%
For decades, tourists weren't
allowed to go in there.

00:26:42.260 --> 00:26:46.050 align:middle line:10%
They've opened it up over
the last 10, 15 years,

00:26:46.050 --> 00:26:48.940 align:middle line:10%
and tourists can
go in there now.

00:26:48.940 --> 00:26:52.070 align:middle line:84%
When you go to the Serapeum,
you're out there in the desert.

00:26:52.070 --> 00:26:53.880 align:middle line:84%
It's just sand and
stuff like that.

00:26:53.880 --> 00:26:57.320 align:middle line:84%
But suddenly, there
is this pathway

00:26:57.320 --> 00:26:59.930 align:middle line:90%
that goes down underground.

00:26:59.930 --> 00:27:04.550 align:middle line:84%
So when you get in there, what's
underground in the Serapeum

00:27:04.550 --> 00:27:08.030 align:middle line:84%
are all these catacombs
and little side kind

00:27:08.030 --> 00:27:11.000 align:middle line:84%
of closets and stuff
that are going one way.

00:27:11.000 --> 00:27:15.740 align:middle line:84%
It's very close, narrow
hallways with little niches

00:27:15.740 --> 00:27:17.370 align:middle line:90%
and stuff on the side.

00:27:17.370 --> 00:27:22.580 align:middle line:84%
And inside are these
gigantic basalt sarcophagi

00:27:22.580 --> 00:27:24.510 align:middle line:90%
with huge lids.

00:27:24.510 --> 00:27:27.890 align:middle line:84%
And they're weighing
about 80 tons.

00:27:27.890 --> 00:27:29.230 align:middle line:90%
It's astonishing.

00:27:29.230 --> 00:27:32.970 align:middle line:84%
They're perfectly
cut and squared.

00:27:32.970 --> 00:27:36.370 align:middle line:84%
They found in one of
them an Apis bull.

00:27:36.370 --> 00:27:41.190 align:middle line:84%
So the Egyptology theory
is that, well, these

00:27:41.190 --> 00:27:44.730 align:middle line:84%
were tombs for these
mummified bulls.

00:27:44.730 --> 00:27:49.020 align:middle line:84%
But, you know, that's maybe
not what was going on here,

00:27:49.020 --> 00:27:50.590 align:middle line:90%
but we don't know what it is.

00:27:50.590 --> 00:27:52.030 align:middle line:90%
So that's me.

00:27:52.030 --> 00:27:56.460 align:middle line:10%
What happens-- in some of
these is what's amazing is that

00:27:56.460 --> 00:28:02.880 align:middle line:10%
the idea is if you're going to
move these giant 80-ton basalt

00:28:02.880 --> 00:28:08.340 align:middle line:10%
boxes, you're going to have to
have all these guys with ropes

00:28:08.340 --> 00:28:09.940 align:middle line:10%
and stuff and
rollers or something.

00:28:09.940 --> 00:28:12.210 align:middle line:10%
You're all pulling and
pushing on these things,

00:28:12.210 --> 00:28:14.880 align:middle line:10%
but then they go into
these little niches

00:28:14.880 --> 00:28:19.680 align:middle line:10%
and there's just no place
for people to stand.

00:28:19.680 --> 00:28:24.070 align:middle line:10%
There can't be some big team
of people pulling in on this.

00:28:24.070 --> 00:28:24.870 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:28:24.870 --> 00:28:28.560 align:middle line:84%
And they would literally
have to move these things

00:28:28.560 --> 00:28:32.670 align:middle line:84%
with anti-gravity
and levitation.

00:28:32.670 --> 00:28:37.620 align:middle line:10%
It sort of reminds me of the
scene at the end of the "Empire

00:28:37.620 --> 00:28:43.350 align:middle line:10%
Strikes Back," when Han Solo's
frozen in carbonite and Boba

00:28:43.350 --> 00:28:49.230 align:middle line:10%
Fett is just it-- it's floating,
and he's pushing it up into his

00:28:49.230 --> 00:28:50.860 align:middle line:10%
spaceship where he's
going to take it.

00:28:50.860 --> 00:28:52.540 align:middle line:90%
And he's just walking behind it.

00:28:52.540 --> 00:28:55.330 align:middle line:84%
And that's what must
have happened here.

00:28:55.330 --> 00:28:57.120 align:middle line:10%
I mean, they made
these things weightless

00:28:57.120 --> 00:29:00.820 align:middle line:10%
and they could just move them
and manipulate them into places.

00:29:00.820 --> 00:29:02.790 align:middle line:84%
To make these boxes,
you would have to,

00:29:02.790 --> 00:29:04.290 align:middle line:84%
according to
Christopher Dunn, you'd

00:29:04.290 --> 00:29:08.040 align:middle line:84%
have to be drilling down
inside it with what,

00:29:08.040 --> 00:29:09.310 align:middle line:90%
diamond drills and stuff.

00:29:09.310 --> 00:29:11.710 align:middle line:90%
This is basalt, extremely hard.

00:29:11.710 --> 00:29:13.740 align:middle line:90%
Basalt is harder than granite.

00:29:13.740 --> 00:29:17.410 align:middle line:84%
So making these things
requires power tools.

00:29:17.410 --> 00:29:21.370 align:middle line:84%
There are some hieroglyphs
on a few of them.

00:29:21.370 --> 00:29:24.600 align:middle line:84%
And just cutting these
hieroglyphs in there

00:29:24.600 --> 00:29:27.060 align:middle line:84%
would take like
lasers or, again,

00:29:27.060 --> 00:29:31.920 align:middle line:84%
diamond tip tools and stuff
like that, power tools.

00:29:31.920 --> 00:29:34.920 align:middle line:84%
And that is something I
constantly maintain in my books,

00:29:34.920 --> 00:29:38.740 align:middle line:84%
how they need using power
tools to make these things.

00:29:38.740 --> 00:29:40.270 align:middle line:90%
Here's Christopher Dunn himself.

00:29:40.270 --> 00:29:43.090 align:middle line:90%
He's got his specialty tools.

00:29:43.090 --> 00:29:46.230 align:middle line:84%
He's measuring how
perfectly straight

00:29:46.230 --> 00:29:50.230 align:middle line:84%
the sides are and the
angles at right angles.

00:29:50.230 --> 00:29:54.870 align:middle line:84%
So yeah, these aren't just
being eyeballed and bashed

00:29:54.870 --> 00:29:56.080 align:middle line:90%
in by somebody.

00:29:56.080 --> 00:29:59.610 align:middle line:84%
It's like
computer-controlled machines

00:29:59.610 --> 00:30:03.750 align:middle line:84%
are cutting this just the
way we would do it today.

00:30:03.750 --> 00:30:06.480 align:middle line:84%
Here again is what it
looks like inside, some

00:30:06.480 --> 00:30:09.060 align:middle line:90%
of these little passageways.

00:30:09.060 --> 00:30:16.530 align:middle line:84%
The boxes, the basalt boxes just
barely fit into these things.

00:30:16.530 --> 00:30:18.060 align:middle line:84%
So they can't
figure out how they

00:30:18.060 --> 00:30:22.650 align:middle line:84%
were moving these except with
some kind of antigravity.

00:30:22.650 --> 00:30:24.780 align:middle line:90%
All right.

00:30:24.780 --> 00:30:26.940 align:middle line:84%
Another curious megalith
around the world

00:30:26.940 --> 00:30:28.360 align:middle line:90%
are these giant stone balls.

00:30:28.360 --> 00:30:29.380 align:middle line:90%
They're in Costa Rica.

00:30:29.380 --> 00:30:30.580 align:middle line:90%
They're granite.

00:30:30.580 --> 00:30:32.350 align:middle line:90%
They know they're man-made.

00:30:32.350 --> 00:30:34.210 align:middle line:90%
There's no question about that.

00:30:34.210 --> 00:30:38.160 align:middle line:84%
But how they would make these
balls, what their purpose was,

00:30:38.160 --> 00:30:39.970 align:middle line:90%
they're different sizes.

00:30:39.970 --> 00:30:44.220 align:middle line:84%
Some of them are about the
size of a Volkswagen Beetle.

00:30:44.220 --> 00:30:47.470 align:middle line:84%
They're perfectly
round, they're solid.

00:30:47.470 --> 00:30:50.320 align:middle line:84%
They don't know how
they would make them.

00:30:50.320 --> 00:30:55.890 align:middle line:84%
They're found washed up in these
jungle areas of Costa Rica.

00:30:55.890 --> 00:30:58.780 align:middle line:84%
And Archeologists
are baffled by it.

00:30:58.780 --> 00:31:01.950 align:middle line:84%
They don't know what the purpose
of these giant stone balls

00:31:01.950 --> 00:31:04.440 align:middle line:90%
would be.

00:31:04.440 --> 00:31:08.220 align:middle line:84%
Indiana Jones, I mean,
I don't know that--

00:31:08.220 --> 00:31:13.980 align:middle line:84%
I mean, maybe that's what they
were for, to chase Archeologists

00:31:13.980 --> 00:31:17.340 align:middle line:90%
down a passageway.

00:31:17.340 --> 00:31:19.902 align:middle line:84%
So here we are, some more
of these stone balls.

00:31:19.902 --> 00:31:21.610 align:middle line:84%
And this is kind of
where they find them.

00:31:21.610 --> 00:31:24.318 align:middle line:84%
They don't find them in
some pyramid or structure.

00:31:24.318 --> 00:31:26.110 align:middle line:84%
They just kind find
them out in the jungle.

00:31:26.110 --> 00:31:27.730 align:middle line:90%
They're half buried and stuff.

00:31:27.730 --> 00:31:30.330 align:middle line:84%
There's also an island off the
West Coast of Costa Rica that

00:31:30.330 --> 00:31:31.780 align:middle line:90%
has these as well.

00:31:31.780 --> 00:31:35.550 align:middle line:90%
And it's baffling.

00:31:35.550 --> 00:31:38.340 align:middle line:84%
What they will say, too, if
you go to the museum there,

00:31:38.340 --> 00:31:43.720 align:middle line:84%
they put a kind of medium-sized
stone ball there with a tomb.

00:31:43.720 --> 00:31:47.040 align:middle line:84%
And they're kind of saying,
well, they were, you know,

00:31:47.040 --> 00:31:48.640 align:middle line:90%
for the Chiefs and stuff.

00:31:48.640 --> 00:31:52.270 align:middle line:84%
It was a status symbol
that they were powerful.

00:31:52.270 --> 00:31:54.300 align:middle line:84%
And maybe the bigger
the stone ball you had,

00:31:54.300 --> 00:31:58.037 align:middle line:90%
the greater the chief you were.

00:31:58.037 --> 00:31:59.620 align:middle line:84%
So that's kind of
what they're saying.

00:31:59.620 --> 00:32:04.220 align:middle line:84%
But they just don't have no
idea what purpose they would be.

00:32:04.220 --> 00:32:05.180 align:middle line:90%
So here we go.

00:32:05.180 --> 00:32:08.270 align:middle line:84%
I mean, this is fairly
recent excavation.

00:32:08.270 --> 00:32:10.780 align:middle line:84%
So this stone ball was
just sort of barely peeking

00:32:10.780 --> 00:32:12.317 align:middle line:90%
up out of the jungle.

00:32:12.317 --> 00:32:13.900 align:middle line:84%
And then they, you
know, Archeologists

00:32:13.900 --> 00:32:15.530 align:middle line:90%
started digging up around it.

00:32:15.530 --> 00:32:19.310 align:middle line:84%
And yeah, it's a perfectly
made stone granite ball.

00:32:19.310 --> 00:32:22.970 align:middle line:84%
They can't and they have
no idea what happened.

00:32:22.970 --> 00:32:26.890 align:middle line:90%
It's almost like a tidal wave.

00:32:26.890 --> 00:32:29.260 align:middle line:84%
Some cataclysm just
took all these balls

00:32:29.260 --> 00:32:34.070 align:middle line:84%
and washed them up into the
jungle hills of Western Costa

00:32:34.070 --> 00:32:34.870 align:middle line:90%
Rica.

00:32:34.870 --> 00:32:40.760 align:middle line:10%
So many of you probably
are from Los Angeles.

00:32:40.760 --> 00:32:43.400 align:middle line:84%
Back around 1910
or so, they were

00:32:43.400 --> 00:32:47.960 align:middle line:84%
building an electric trolley
from Santa Monica from the out

00:32:47.960 --> 00:32:50.480 align:middle line:90%
inland into Los Angeles.

00:32:50.480 --> 00:32:53.130 align:middle line:84%
And there was this little--
there was this book,

00:32:53.130 --> 00:32:57.800 align:middle line:84%
a guy sent it to me, and it
was just like a little booklet

00:32:57.800 --> 00:33:00.200 align:middle line:90%
about building the trolley.

00:33:00.200 --> 00:33:02.870 align:middle line:84%
And it was an electric trolley,
so it could only go up--

00:33:02.870 --> 00:33:05.840 align:middle line:84%
there were hills and stuff
there and in Santa Monica,

00:33:05.840 --> 00:33:09.810 align:middle line:84%
but it could only go
up a very low grade.

00:33:09.810 --> 00:33:12.300 align:middle line:84%
It couldn't go up a
steep grade and stuff.

00:33:12.300 --> 00:33:16.880 align:middle line:84%
So what happened was they needed
to take out some of this hill

00:33:16.880 --> 00:33:18.560 align:middle line:90%
there in Santa Monica.

00:33:18.560 --> 00:33:20.420 align:middle line:10%
And they brought this
steam shovel in it

00:33:20.420 --> 00:33:22.920 align:middle line:10%
and they started
digging it up and stuff.

00:33:22.920 --> 00:33:24.120 align:middle line:90%
And what did they find?

00:33:24.120 --> 00:33:25.150 align:middle line:90%
A bunch of stone balls.

00:33:25.150 --> 00:33:29.280 align:middle line:90%


00:33:29.280 --> 00:33:33.458 align:middle line:84%
At the time, they called
them dinosaur eggs.

00:33:33.458 --> 00:33:35.500 align:middle line:84%
We don't know what happened
to these stone balls.

00:33:35.500 --> 00:33:37.920 align:middle line:84%
They probably ended
up in backyard gardens

00:33:37.920 --> 00:33:39.380 align:middle line:90%
and stuff in Los Angeles.

00:33:39.380 --> 00:33:42.410 align:middle line:84%
We don't know where they went,
but that's what they found.

00:33:42.410 --> 00:33:44.580 align:middle line:90%
So, yeah.

00:33:44.580 --> 00:33:48.020 align:middle line:84%
Franz Josef Land in
the Russian Arctic.

00:33:48.020 --> 00:33:49.750 align:middle line:90%
It's called Champ Island.

00:33:49.750 --> 00:33:53.490 align:middle line:10%
This is kind of near
Spitsbergen. Cruise ships do

00:33:53.490 --> 00:33:56.460 align:middle line:10%
go up here occasionally, and
there are granite stone balls

00:33:56.460 --> 00:33:57.680 align:middle line:10%
there.

00:33:57.680 --> 00:34:01.310 align:middle line:84%
And they don't-- I mean,
this is what's baffling,

00:34:01.310 --> 00:34:04.160 align:middle line:84%
is that we have the
ones in Costa Rica,

00:34:04.160 --> 00:34:05.430 align:middle line:90%
we know they're man-made.

00:34:05.430 --> 00:34:07.070 align:middle line:90%
There's no question about it.

00:34:07.070 --> 00:34:11.310 align:middle line:84%
And now we have these
ones in Franz Josef Land.

00:34:11.310 --> 00:34:13.110 align:middle line:90%
They're virtually identical.

00:34:13.110 --> 00:34:16.070 align:middle line:84%
They're granite,
too, but they're

00:34:16.070 --> 00:34:19.699 align:middle line:84%
saying to geologists and
archeologists, they're like,

00:34:19.699 --> 00:34:25.092 align:middle line:84%
well, you know, these
have to be natural.

00:34:25.092 --> 00:34:27.800 align:middle line:84%
People didn't-- couldn't come up
here and make these stone balls.

00:34:27.800 --> 00:34:30.500 align:middle line:84%
But they don't know
how that would be.

00:34:30.500 --> 00:34:34.159 align:middle line:84%
I mean, how is it
that in nature you're

00:34:34.159 --> 00:34:37.429 align:middle line:84%
going to have a perfectly
spherical granite ball?

00:34:37.429 --> 00:34:39.560 align:middle line:10%
I mean, what they
would theorize is

00:34:39.560 --> 00:34:43.820 align:middle line:10%
that, yeah, some volcano or
something is spewing out magma

00:34:43.820 --> 00:34:45.699 align:middle line:10%
and it's going through the air.

00:34:45.699 --> 00:34:47.540 align:middle line:84%
And it's spinning around
and becomes a ball

00:34:47.540 --> 00:34:50.000 align:middle line:84%
and it hardens
and lands, I mean,

00:34:50.000 --> 00:34:52.909 align:middle line:84%
you know, they can't explain
it, particularly when

00:34:52.909 --> 00:34:53.870 align:middle line:90%
they're granite.

00:34:53.870 --> 00:34:56.360 align:middle line:90%
So here's another one of them.

00:34:56.360 --> 00:34:58.550 align:middle line:84%
Some of them have
been split and stuff.

00:34:58.550 --> 00:35:02.130 align:middle line:10%
But yeah, once again,
they can't explain it.

00:35:02.130 --> 00:35:03.810 align:middle line:10%
Here's another one.

00:35:03.810 --> 00:35:05.610 align:middle line:10%
It's got big lichen
patches on it,

00:35:05.610 --> 00:35:08.280 align:middle line:10%
so that means that
it's quite old.

00:35:08.280 --> 00:35:10.570 align:middle line:84%
These are some stone
balls in Bosnia.

00:35:10.570 --> 00:35:13.020 align:middle line:84%
Went there to that pyramid
in Bosnia one time,

00:35:13.020 --> 00:35:17.910 align:middle line:84%
and there was some miles away,
like about 100 miles away it's

00:35:17.910 --> 00:35:22.950 align:middle line:84%
this valley, and it has
also stone balls are there.

00:35:22.950 --> 00:35:25.090 align:middle line:84%
So again, we can't
really explain it.

00:35:25.090 --> 00:35:26.580 align:middle line:90%
Here's some more.

00:35:26.580 --> 00:35:30.970 align:middle line:84%
There's also a place in
Mexico called Piedras Bola.

00:35:30.970 --> 00:35:34.140 align:middle line:84%
And these ones, this is also
where they're saying like,

00:35:34.140 --> 00:35:37.470 align:middle line:84%
yeah, volcanoes are kind
of spewing out these stone

00:35:37.470 --> 00:35:38.760 align:middle line:90%
balls somehow.

00:35:38.760 --> 00:35:43.030 align:middle line:84%
And in Mexico, maybe
that is the case.

00:35:43.030 --> 00:35:44.310 align:middle line:90%
We don't know.

00:35:44.310 --> 00:35:45.970 align:middle line:90%
Here's a place in Siberia.

00:35:45.970 --> 00:35:48.210 align:middle line:90%
Also stone balls.

00:35:48.210 --> 00:35:50.080 align:middle line:90%
Some of them are limestone.

00:35:50.080 --> 00:35:56.670 align:middle line:84%
And then the idea there is that
they somehow become aggregate

00:35:56.670 --> 00:35:58.270 align:middle line:90%
in a stream or something.

00:35:58.270 --> 00:36:02.680 align:middle line:84%
And over time, it builds up
and becomes a stone ball.

00:36:02.680 --> 00:36:06.660 align:middle line:84%
But geologists, you
know, it's like they--

00:36:06.660 --> 00:36:09.990 align:middle line:84%
it's like they have to explain
it somehow but they can't.

00:36:09.990 --> 00:36:13.020 align:middle line:84%
And they're just
baffled by this.

00:36:13.020 --> 00:36:15.180 align:middle line:84%
The Moeraki boulders
in New Zealand.

00:36:15.180 --> 00:36:18.250 align:middle line:84%
This is down on the Western
side of the South Island.

00:36:18.250 --> 00:36:20.450 align:middle line:90%
There's a whole bunch there.

00:36:20.450 --> 00:36:22.290 align:middle line:84%
There are also
these stone balls.

00:36:22.290 --> 00:36:24.010 align:middle line:84%
Some of them are
cracking and stuff.

00:36:24.010 --> 00:36:26.473 align:middle line:84%
It's a popular tourist
site in New Zealand.

00:36:26.473 --> 00:36:28.140 align:middle line:84%
And again, they're
saying, well, they're

00:36:28.140 --> 00:36:30.850 align:middle line:90%
just natural stone balls.

00:36:30.850 --> 00:36:33.780 align:middle line:84%
We don't know how they make them
or how they're made by nature,

00:36:33.780 --> 00:36:35.050 align:middle line:90%
but here they are.

00:36:35.050 --> 00:36:38.260 align:middle line:84%
So, yeah, I mean, it's
again, a baffling thing.

00:36:38.260 --> 00:36:40.080 align:middle line:84%
I recently got an
email from a guy

00:36:40.080 --> 00:36:43.230 align:middle line:84%
in New Zealand who showed
me how they were digging

00:36:43.230 --> 00:36:47.070 align:middle line:84%
one out of a hill,
and he said that

00:36:47.070 --> 00:36:49.620 align:middle line:84%
to him, that proved that
they weren't natural,

00:36:49.620 --> 00:36:54.600 align:middle line:84%
that they were also artificial,
like the ones in Costa Rica.

00:36:54.600 --> 00:36:57.210 align:middle line:84%
There's a place in Italy
that also got these stone

00:36:57.210 --> 00:36:59.890 align:middle line:90%
balls, San Augusta, Italy.

00:36:59.890 --> 00:37:03.310 align:middle line:84%
And they're people-- you
know, they're just out there

00:37:03.310 --> 00:37:04.850 align:middle line:90%
on these areas.

00:37:04.850 --> 00:37:06.370 align:middle line:84%
They've kind of
moved a lot of them

00:37:06.370 --> 00:37:09.340 align:middle line:84%
to some of the
castles and stuff.

00:37:09.340 --> 00:37:13.070 align:middle line:90%
So yeah, more stone balls.

00:37:13.070 --> 00:37:16.650 align:middle line:84%
There's also another place in
Italy with the stone balls.

00:37:16.650 --> 00:37:18.680 align:middle line:84%
So, yeah, they're
wondering about these,

00:37:18.680 --> 00:37:21.710 align:middle line:84%
were they being-- were they
like giant cannon balls

00:37:21.710 --> 00:37:25.160 align:middle line:84%
that they were using for
catapults or something?

00:37:25.160 --> 00:37:27.140 align:middle line:90%
We don't know.

00:37:27.140 --> 00:37:28.140 align:middle line:90%
Here they are again.

00:37:28.140 --> 00:37:29.220 align:middle line:90%
This is in Dubrovnik.

00:37:29.220 --> 00:37:30.860 align:middle line:90%
These are smaller ones.

00:37:30.860 --> 00:37:32.690 align:middle line:84%
But again, the stone
balls, you might

00:37:32.690 --> 00:37:35.210 align:middle line:84%
think they could use
them for like moving some

00:37:35.210 --> 00:37:37.600 align:middle line:90%
of the megaliths or something.

00:37:37.600 --> 00:37:39.230 align:middle line:90%
OK, here's a place in China.

00:37:39.230 --> 00:37:40.660 align:middle line:90%
Gongxi, Hunan.

00:37:40.660 --> 00:37:41.570 align:middle line:90%
It's this village.

00:37:41.570 --> 00:37:43.450 align:middle line:84%
It's got all these
stone balls in it.

00:37:43.450 --> 00:37:46.220 align:middle line:84%
So this is-- where
stone balls appear,

00:37:46.220 --> 00:37:48.560 align:middle line:90%
they become like tourist sites.

00:37:48.560 --> 00:37:53.150 align:middle line:84%
But again, people just can't
explain what's going on.

00:37:53.150 --> 00:37:56.230 align:middle line:84%
Here's more of the
stone balls in Gongxi.

00:37:56.230 --> 00:37:58.780 align:middle line:84%
So I've been fascinated
by it, but I still

00:37:58.780 --> 00:38:00.218 align:middle line:90%
don't have a really good idea.

00:38:00.218 --> 00:38:02.260 align:middle line:84%
You know, one explanation
they said in Costa Rica

00:38:02.260 --> 00:38:04.677 align:middle line:84%
was that, well, they would use
these stone balls to create

00:38:04.677 --> 00:38:08.350 align:middle line:84%
giant star maps for navigators
and they would roll them around

00:38:08.350 --> 00:38:10.270 align:middle line:84%
like, well, you know,
this island's over here

00:38:10.270 --> 00:38:15.260 align:middle line:84%
and these stars, but again, that
doesn't really quite make sense.

00:38:15.260 --> 00:38:17.300 align:middle line:90%
These are stone balls at Malta.

00:38:17.300 --> 00:38:21.190 align:middle line:84%
Malta for a while were the
oldest ruins, they said.

00:38:21.190 --> 00:38:24.610 align:middle line:84%
There were found
stone balls there.

00:38:24.610 --> 00:38:28.330 align:middle line:84%
Gobekli Tepe is now, they
say is older than Malta.

00:38:28.330 --> 00:38:30.500 align:middle line:90%
This is a place in Sardinia.

00:38:30.500 --> 00:38:36.700 align:middle line:84%
It's like a ramped pyramid and
it's got a couple of stone balls

00:38:36.700 --> 00:38:38.820 align:middle line:90%
on it, which are featured.

00:38:38.820 --> 00:38:41.000 align:middle line:84%
And the Archeologists
always realize

00:38:41.000 --> 00:38:43.040 align:middle line:84%
that these stone
balls are important,

00:38:43.040 --> 00:38:44.640 align:middle line:90%
but they don't know how.

00:38:44.640 --> 00:38:46.640 align:middle line:90%
They don't know why.

00:38:46.640 --> 00:38:48.660 align:middle line:90%
There's even in the Isle of Man.

00:38:48.660 --> 00:38:50.960 align:middle line:84%
I was there with Hugh Newman
a couple of years ago,

00:38:50.960 --> 00:38:56.450 align:middle line:84%
and I found out that in this
harbor there on the Isle of Man,

00:38:56.450 --> 00:38:58.280 align:middle line:84%
you can only see it
at low tide, I guess,

00:38:58.280 --> 00:39:00.715 align:middle line:90%
is also a granite stone ball.

00:39:00.715 --> 00:39:03.620 align:middle line:90%


00:39:03.620 --> 00:39:06.230 align:middle line:84%
Here's a stone ball
in Easter Island.

00:39:06.230 --> 00:39:07.270 align:middle line:90%
So we'll go there.

00:39:07.270 --> 00:39:09.620 align:middle line:84%
This is a relatively--
kind of small one,

00:39:09.620 --> 00:39:13.190 align:middle line:84%
probably about the size of
a volleyball or something.

00:39:13.190 --> 00:39:18.440 align:middle line:84%
But they say on Easter Island
that the most important thing

00:39:18.440 --> 00:39:22.000 align:middle line:84%
on the island isn't the stone
statues or walls and stuff.

00:39:22.000 --> 00:39:24.770 align:middle line:90%
It's this ball right here.

00:39:24.770 --> 00:39:27.390 align:middle line:84%
It's the most important
thing on the whole island.

00:39:27.390 --> 00:39:29.780 align:middle line:84%
And they say that
this ball was used

00:39:29.780 --> 00:39:33.770 align:middle line:84%
to move the statues who
walked around the island.

00:39:33.770 --> 00:39:36.530 align:middle line:84%
And they put them around
the island, Easter Island

00:39:36.530 --> 00:39:40.940 align:middle line:84%
with eyes that
were facing inland.

00:39:40.940 --> 00:39:43.650 align:middle line:84%
So here's the quarry
on Easter Island.

00:39:43.650 --> 00:39:49.460 align:middle line:84%
And it's at Rano
Raraku, and it's

00:39:49.460 --> 00:39:50.970 align:middle line:90%
in the interior of the island.

00:39:50.970 --> 00:39:53.750 align:middle line:84%
It's a big extinct
volcano crater.

00:39:53.750 --> 00:39:57.410 align:middle line:84%
It's granite and
basalt, and that's

00:39:57.410 --> 00:40:00.770 align:middle line:84%
where you have a lot of
these statues are there.

00:40:00.770 --> 00:40:03.368 align:middle line:84%
Some of them are buried
deep into their chests.

00:40:03.368 --> 00:40:04.910 align:middle line:84%
The purpose of these
statues, though,

00:40:04.910 --> 00:40:08.120 align:middle line:84%
was to be moving them
around to the outer parts,

00:40:08.120 --> 00:40:12.120 align:middle line:84%
the coastal areas of the island,
and they would face inland.

00:40:12.120 --> 00:40:15.720 align:middle line:90%
This is what they say there.

00:40:15.720 --> 00:40:17.170 align:middle line:90%
So here's what it looks like.

00:40:17.170 --> 00:40:21.580 align:middle line:84%
This is like the slopes of
the volcano which is a quarry.

00:40:21.580 --> 00:40:24.640 align:middle line:84%
And then the statues are
kind of standing there.

00:40:24.640 --> 00:40:28.530 align:middle line:84%
Some of them are leaning
over and whatnot.

00:40:28.530 --> 00:40:33.520 align:middle line:84%
And this shows you here where
the Rano Raraku area is here.

00:40:33.520 --> 00:40:37.560 align:middle line:84%
But what you see
is that they put

00:40:37.560 --> 00:40:40.200 align:middle line:84%
the statues all
around the island,

00:40:40.200 --> 00:40:43.523 align:middle line:84%
and they're faced inland,
they had inlaid eyes.

00:40:43.523 --> 00:40:44.940 align:middle line:84%
According to the
Easter islanders,

00:40:44.940 --> 00:40:48.070 align:middle line:90%
a power came out of their eyes.

00:40:48.070 --> 00:40:49.300 align:middle line:90%
They call it "mana."

00:40:49.300 --> 00:40:52.470 align:middle line:84%
And that power kept
the island from sinking

00:40:52.470 --> 00:40:55.110 align:middle line:84%
because they were from
a lost land called

00:40:55.110 --> 00:40:57.430 align:middle line:90%
Hiva, which was gone.

00:40:57.430 --> 00:41:01.060 align:middle line:84%
And it was underwater now,
but Easter Island was left.

00:41:01.060 --> 00:41:02.670 align:middle line:84%
And so the statues,
they believed,

00:41:02.670 --> 00:41:05.710 align:middle line:84%
were keeping the island
from sinking this power.

00:41:05.710 --> 00:41:07.920 align:middle line:84%
And what they say
is that the statues

00:41:07.920 --> 00:41:13.300 align:middle line:84%
had to walk in a clockwise
fashion around the island.

00:41:13.300 --> 00:41:16.210 align:middle line:84%
And up here is a
volcano that has

00:41:16.210 --> 00:41:18.310 align:middle line:90%
a big, strong magnetic field.

00:41:18.310 --> 00:41:21.500 align:middle line:84%
And your compass
goes crazy there.

00:41:21.500 --> 00:41:23.390 align:middle line:90%
They mark it on maps.

00:41:23.390 --> 00:41:27.220 align:middle line:84%
Jacques Cousteau's
son, Philippe Cousteau,

00:41:27.220 --> 00:41:32.330 align:middle line:84%
flew over this area in an
ultralight back in the 1970s.

00:41:32.330 --> 00:41:35.500 align:middle line:84%
They told him to stay
away from that volcano

00:41:35.500 --> 00:41:37.730 align:middle line:84%
because his instruments
would go crazy.

00:41:37.730 --> 00:41:39.040 align:middle line:90%
But he did fly--

00:41:39.040 --> 00:41:41.000 align:middle line:84%
but he decided to
fly over it anyway.

00:41:41.000 --> 00:41:43.330 align:middle line:84%
And his instruments went
crazy and he crashed

00:41:43.330 --> 00:41:44.810 align:middle line:90%
and he was almost killed.

00:41:44.810 --> 00:41:48.100 align:middle line:84%
And they had to medevac
him to Santiago and Chile

00:41:48.100 --> 00:41:49.430 align:middle line:90%
to save his life.

00:41:49.430 --> 00:41:51.520 align:middle line:84%
So that's all--
it's all so weird

00:41:51.520 --> 00:41:54.110 align:middle line:84%
what's going on there
at Easter Island.

00:41:54.110 --> 00:42:01.300 align:middle line:84%
And the statues themselves are
often heavily buried under--

00:42:01.300 --> 00:42:03.830 align:middle line:90%
right up to the chest.

00:42:03.830 --> 00:42:07.450 align:middle line:84%
There is like 30 feet
of soil around them.

00:42:07.450 --> 00:42:10.050 align:middle line:10%
These are some of what
the statues look like.

00:42:10.050 --> 00:42:11.250 align:middle line:10%
They're standing up.

00:42:11.250 --> 00:42:13.680 align:middle line:10%
They had a top hat on them.

00:42:13.680 --> 00:42:16.430 align:middle line:10%
Some of them are
gigantically huge.

00:42:16.430 --> 00:42:18.150 align:middle line:90%
They do not have any feet.

00:42:18.150 --> 00:42:21.560 align:middle line:84%
They're holding their
hands down by their waist.

00:42:21.560 --> 00:42:24.410 align:middle line:84%
I've decided actually,
that these statues

00:42:24.410 --> 00:42:26.840 align:middle line:90%
are statues of Shiva.

00:42:26.840 --> 00:42:27.850 align:middle line:90%
That's what they are.

00:42:27.850 --> 00:42:29.310 align:middle line:84%
Here we see, here's
Thor Heyerdahl.

00:42:29.310 --> 00:42:33.050 align:middle line:84%
But this shows you how deeply
buried some of these statues

00:42:33.050 --> 00:42:33.890 align:middle line:90%
are.

00:42:33.890 --> 00:42:37.350 align:middle line:84%
I mean, that means that
they've been there a long time.

00:42:37.350 --> 00:42:41.150 align:middle line:84%
I mean, probably thousands
of years with that much soil

00:42:41.150 --> 00:42:45.360 align:middle line:84%
to accumulate around the
base of these statues.

00:42:45.360 --> 00:42:47.900 align:middle line:84%
I mean, this is
really something.

00:42:47.900 --> 00:42:52.100 align:middle line:10%
So here we are again, looking
at these giant Easter Island

00:42:52.100 --> 00:42:54.840 align:middle line:10%
statues and how huge they
are, how buried they are.

00:42:54.840 --> 00:42:57.510 align:middle line:10%
This one actually had
a ship carved onto it.

00:42:57.510 --> 00:43:00.380 align:middle line:84%
But this is all part of
the baffling kind of stuff

00:43:00.380 --> 00:43:02.350 align:middle line:90%
of these things being buried.

00:43:02.350 --> 00:43:04.890 align:middle line:84%
And as I was
saying, as I believe

00:43:04.890 --> 00:43:06.950 align:middle line:90%
they are statues of Shiva.

00:43:06.950 --> 00:43:11.450 align:middle line:84%
This is what they had when they
put these inlaid eyes in them.

00:43:11.450 --> 00:43:13.880 align:middle line:84%
They would have these
eyes and this energy

00:43:13.880 --> 00:43:15.710 align:middle line:84%
would come out of
the eyes that was

00:43:15.710 --> 00:43:18.900 align:middle line:84%
supposed to keep the island
from going down under.

00:43:18.900 --> 00:43:20.490 align:middle line:90%
This is in the museum there.

00:43:20.490 --> 00:43:22.070 align:middle line:90%
This is a female statue.

00:43:22.070 --> 00:43:23.790 align:middle line:90%
Quite a weird one, too.

00:43:23.790 --> 00:43:25.330 align:middle line:90%
This is a unique statue.

00:43:25.330 --> 00:43:26.510 align:middle line:90%
Totally strange.

00:43:26.510 --> 00:43:29.810 align:middle line:84%
Apparently elongated head,
the eyes looking kind of

00:43:29.810 --> 00:43:32.030 align:middle line:90%
like an extraterrestrial here.

00:43:32.030 --> 00:43:35.910 align:middle line:84%
Here's another statue, too,
that was found in 1960.

00:43:35.910 --> 00:43:38.420 align:middle line:84%
It looks like an
alien type head.

00:43:38.420 --> 00:43:41.960 align:middle line:84%
It's also now in
that museum as well.

00:43:41.960 --> 00:43:43.640 align:middle line:90%
Here it is right here.

00:43:43.640 --> 00:43:48.110 align:middle line:84%
Totally different from
the other statues there.

00:43:48.110 --> 00:43:51.590 align:middle line:84%
There's also a wall at
Easter Island called Vinapu,

00:43:51.590 --> 00:43:54.560 align:middle line:84%
and it's facing
to South America,

00:43:54.560 --> 00:43:57.810 align:middle line:90%
facing to Peru and Chile.

00:43:57.810 --> 00:44:00.600 align:middle line:84%
And it is, again, like
what you see in Peru

00:44:00.600 --> 00:44:05.180 align:middle line:84%
and in Bolivia, these perfectly
fitted walls were of granite,

00:44:05.180 --> 00:44:09.210 align:middle line:84%
they're cut, they're
fitted together perfectly.

00:44:09.210 --> 00:44:13.980 align:middle line:84%
You can't slip a razor blade or
$1 bill in between the blocks.

00:44:13.980 --> 00:44:16.580 align:middle line:84%
This is, again, the power
tools needed to do this.

00:44:16.580 --> 00:44:19.490 align:middle line:84%
You see the big
lichen patches there.

00:44:19.490 --> 00:44:21.110 align:middle line:84%
The way that they're
cutting it, they

00:44:21.110 --> 00:44:24.300 align:middle line:84%
put these little notch,
little stones in there.

00:44:24.300 --> 00:44:25.550 align:middle line:90%
Again, perfectly.

00:44:25.550 --> 00:44:29.150 align:middle line:84%
This is the exact
same kind of stonework

00:44:29.150 --> 00:44:31.670 align:middle line:84%
that you see in Peru, and in
other places around the world,

00:44:31.670 --> 00:44:33.180 align:middle line:90%
too.

00:44:33.180 --> 00:44:37.150 align:middle line:84%
So there is an unusual
statue at Easter Island

00:44:37.150 --> 00:44:39.270 align:middle line:90%
that's at the volcano.

00:44:39.270 --> 00:44:42.340 align:middle line:84%
Thor Heyerdahl also
discovered this one, too.

00:44:42.340 --> 00:44:44.740 align:middle line:90%
And this is a unique statue.

00:44:44.740 --> 00:44:46.300 align:middle line:90%
He's kneeling.

00:44:46.300 --> 00:44:47.770 align:middle line:90%
He's kneeling down.

00:44:47.770 --> 00:44:50.500 align:middle line:84%
And this is-- and he's got
his hands on his knees.

00:44:50.500 --> 00:44:53.280 align:middle line:84%
And this is what
they call Quizuo.

00:44:53.280 --> 00:44:56.550 align:middle line:84%
The Quizuo posture, that's
you're on your knees,

00:44:56.550 --> 00:44:58.050 align:middle line:84%
you've got your
hands on your knees,

00:44:58.050 --> 00:45:00.040 align:middle line:84%
and usually you're
putting your head forward.

00:45:00.040 --> 00:45:03.850 align:middle line:84%
So this one's from Shang,
China, the Quizuo position.

00:45:03.850 --> 00:45:07.080 align:middle line:84%
This is a very unusual
position, but we find it

00:45:07.080 --> 00:45:08.150 align:middle line:90%
all over the world.

00:45:08.150 --> 00:45:11.610 align:middle line:84%
Here's an Egyptian statue
with the Quizuo position.

00:45:11.610 --> 00:45:16.920 align:middle line:84%
It's thought to be a position
of supplication of like you're

00:45:16.920 --> 00:45:20.290 align:middle line:84%
in front of the king
or some super ruler

00:45:20.290 --> 00:45:23.280 align:middle line:84%
so you get down on your
knees, you put your hands

00:45:23.280 --> 00:45:25.350 align:middle line:84%
on your knees, and you
kind of put your head

00:45:25.350 --> 00:45:27.540 align:middle line:90%
forward a little bit.

00:45:27.540 --> 00:45:33.930 align:middle line:84%
So it's a special,
special way to sit.

00:45:33.930 --> 00:45:35.350 align:middle line:90%
And we find it around the world.

00:45:35.350 --> 00:45:37.150 align:middle line:84%
This is another
Shang Chinese one.

00:45:37.150 --> 00:45:39.960 align:middle line:90%
He's got a mohawk haircut.

00:45:39.960 --> 00:45:42.820 align:middle line:84%
We find the Quizuo
statues at Tiwanaku.

00:45:42.820 --> 00:45:44.890 align:middle line:84%
These statues were
from Tiwanaku.

00:45:44.890 --> 00:45:48.180 align:middle line:84%
Today, they're in
the museum in La Paz.

00:45:48.180 --> 00:45:49.583 align:middle line:90%
They're wearing turbans.

00:45:49.583 --> 00:45:50.500 align:middle line:90%
They have their hands.

00:45:50.500 --> 00:45:51.310 align:middle line:90%
They're on their knees.

00:45:51.310 --> 00:45:52.852 align:middle line:84%
They have their
hands on their knees.

00:45:52.852 --> 00:45:56.640 align:middle line:84%
So once again, the Quizuo
statue, like in Easter Island.

00:45:56.640 --> 00:46:00.960 align:middle line:84%
Here's a Quizuo statue
of an Olmec statue.

00:46:00.960 --> 00:46:04.770 align:middle line:84%
So this one's near
Veracruz and Jalapa

00:46:04.770 --> 00:46:07.030 align:middle line:90%
in the East Coast of Mexico.

00:46:07.030 --> 00:46:11.530 align:middle line:84%
He also is wearing like a turban
or he has a topknot on his head.

00:46:11.530 --> 00:46:13.750 align:middle line:84%
And that is what
Shiva looks like.

00:46:13.750 --> 00:46:17.800 align:middle line:84%
If you know the statues of
Shiva or depictions of Shiva,

00:46:17.800 --> 00:46:19.990 align:middle line:90%
Shiva has very long hair.

00:46:19.990 --> 00:46:21.240 align:middle line:90%
That's what called Shiva.

00:46:21.240 --> 00:46:25.110 align:middle line:84%
And they tie it in a bun
up on top of their head.

00:46:25.110 --> 00:46:27.600 align:middle line:84%
Shaivites, who are
worshipping Shiva.

00:46:27.600 --> 00:46:31.300 align:middle line:84%
Here's a Harappa statue
from ancient Harappa.

00:46:31.300 --> 00:46:35.280 align:middle line:84%
This is super ancient
India, Indus valley,

00:46:35.280 --> 00:46:37.570 align:middle line:90%
and in Pakistan and India.

00:46:37.570 --> 00:46:40.000 align:middle line:84%
He's in the Quizuo
position, too.

00:46:40.000 --> 00:46:43.440 align:middle line:84%
So what this does is it
connects all these civilizations

00:46:43.440 --> 00:46:45.670 align:middle line:90%
all over the world.

00:46:45.670 --> 00:46:47.170 align:middle line:90%
So here's Nan Madol.

00:46:47.170 --> 00:46:50.200 align:middle line:84%
This place is the 8th
wonder of the world.

00:46:50.200 --> 00:46:55.180 align:middle line:84%
It's on an island in Micronesia,
on an island called Pohnpei.

00:46:55.180 --> 00:46:57.040 align:middle line:90%
It's actually in the ocean.

00:46:57.040 --> 00:46:58.240 align:middle line:90%
It's built on a coral reef.

00:46:58.240 --> 00:47:00.670 align:middle line:84%
About half of the
city is underwater.

00:47:00.670 --> 00:47:03.010 align:middle line:90%
It has walls about 40 feet high.

00:47:03.010 --> 00:47:06.640 align:middle line:84%
The largest stones there
are said to be 80 tons.

00:47:06.640 --> 00:47:10.980 align:middle line:84%
Giorgio and I went there to do
an episode of "Ancient Aliens,"

00:47:10.980 --> 00:47:15.010 align:middle line:84%
and I'd been there
about five times or so.

00:47:15.010 --> 00:47:17.250 align:middle line:84%
You normally will
go there in a boat

00:47:17.250 --> 00:47:19.270 align:middle line:84%
and you go through
all these canals.

00:47:19.270 --> 00:47:24.810 align:middle line:84%
They stack these basalt crystals
in a Lincoln Log fashion

00:47:24.810 --> 00:47:27.490 align:middle line:90%
into walls 30, 40 feet high.

00:47:27.490 --> 00:47:30.400 align:middle line:84%
There's like 100
artificial islands here.

00:47:30.400 --> 00:47:32.110 align:middle line:84%
This is kind of
what it looks like.

00:47:32.110 --> 00:47:34.270 align:middle line:90%
These canals, these big walls.

00:47:34.270 --> 00:47:36.230 align:middle line:84%
Like I say, about half
of it's underwater.

00:47:36.230 --> 00:47:37.580 align:middle line:90%
You can't, they say--

00:47:37.580 --> 00:47:38.380 align:middle line:90%
get this.

00:47:38.380 --> 00:47:44.710 align:middle line:84%
They say there's at least
250 million tons of basalt

00:47:44.710 --> 00:47:48.110 align:middle line:84%
that are stacked up
and put into this site.

00:47:48.110 --> 00:47:49.370 align:middle line:90%
It's astonishing.

00:47:49.370 --> 00:47:50.780 align:middle line:84%
It's the 8th wonder
of the world.

00:47:50.780 --> 00:47:53.920 align:middle line:84%
And they, the
islanders, all tell you

00:47:53.920 --> 00:47:59.110 align:middle line:84%
that they flew these stones from
the other side of the island

00:47:59.110 --> 00:48:02.230 align:middle line:84%
and they levitate them and they
flew them across the island.

00:48:02.230 --> 00:48:04.310 align:middle line:84%
The Archeologists
don't believe that,

00:48:04.310 --> 00:48:06.970 align:middle line:84%
so they believe that somehow
they just put all these things,

00:48:06.970 --> 00:48:12.010 align:middle line:84%
80-ton blocks, onto a canoe,
little outrigger canoe

00:48:12.010 --> 00:48:14.180 align:middle line:84%
and paddled them
here and moved them.

00:48:14.180 --> 00:48:17.350 align:middle line:10%
I mean, you're standing
there, you're looking at it.

00:48:17.350 --> 00:48:20.680 align:middle line:10%
I mean-- and you believe
that they flew these rocks

00:48:20.680 --> 00:48:21.525 align:middle line:10%
through the air.

00:48:21.525 --> 00:48:22.400 align:middle line:90%
That's what they say.

00:48:22.400 --> 00:48:24.500 align:middle line:84%
Here's some of the
ones underwater.

00:48:24.500 --> 00:48:26.775 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, they're like, wow.

00:48:26.775 --> 00:48:28.150 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, you totally
believe it when

00:48:28.150 --> 00:48:29.733 align:middle line:84%
you're there because
you can't imagine

00:48:29.733 --> 00:48:31.490 align:middle line:90%
them doing it any other way.

00:48:31.490 --> 00:48:35.770 align:middle line:84%
I mean, this is such a
colossal building project

00:48:35.770 --> 00:48:39.710 align:middle line:84%
that it's just on a scope
that's just unimaginable.

00:48:39.710 --> 00:48:43.690 align:middle line:84%
And the population of the
island today is not very big.

00:48:43.690 --> 00:48:46.840 align:middle line:84%
Here's more underwater
stuff there.

00:48:46.840 --> 00:48:47.690 align:middle line:90%
Here we go.

00:48:47.690 --> 00:48:52.190 align:middle line:84%
I actually go scuba diving and
snorkeling all over the place.

00:48:52.190 --> 00:48:53.540 align:middle line:90%
The tide comes in.

00:48:53.540 --> 00:48:57.670 align:middle line:84%
Now, what the islanders
say is that the stones

00:48:57.670 --> 00:49:00.160 align:middle line:84%
came from this
basalt plug, which

00:49:00.160 --> 00:49:02.110 align:middle line:84%
is on the other
side of the island,

00:49:02.110 --> 00:49:03.610 align:middle line:90%
on the west side of the island.

00:49:03.610 --> 00:49:07.940 align:middle line:84%
And they call this
"chicken shit mountain."

00:49:07.940 --> 00:49:09.600 align:middle line:90%
And here's the thing.

00:49:09.600 --> 00:49:12.530 align:middle line:84%
There is so much basalt,
these basalt logs

00:49:12.530 --> 00:49:16.100 align:middle line:84%
and crystals at Nan Madol,
and entire mountains

00:49:16.100 --> 00:49:19.190 align:middle line:84%
would be dismantled to
get all that basalt.

00:49:19.190 --> 00:49:22.400 align:middle line:90%
250 million tons of it.

00:49:22.400 --> 00:49:24.350 align:middle line:90%
It's amazing.
