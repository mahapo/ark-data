[THEME MUSIC]

00:00:11.155 --> 00:00:13.410 align:middle line:10%
>>ADAM APOLLO: Thank you
guys for coming today.

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:18.800 align:middle line:10%
We are going to be diving into
the ancient mysteries of Earth.

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:20.340 align:middle line:90%
Where did humans come from?

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:21.470 align:middle line:90%
Where did we come from?

00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:25.160 align:middle line:84%
What is this great story that
we're actually all a part of?

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:32.090 align:middle line:10%
And why do we have all of
these amazing megalithic sites

00:00:32.090 --> 00:00:39.090 align:middle line:10%
all over the world that we
don't know how to build now

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:43.200 align:middle line:10%
and yet we assume that the
story we're told in school

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:46.950 align:middle line:10%
is correct that it was
all hammer and chisels?

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:49.500 align:middle line:90%
Where did they come from?

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:55.060 align:middle line:84%
What is the true story of
our journey as a people?

00:00:55.060 --> 00:00:57.840 align:middle line:84%
Did we have some super
epic advanced civilization

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:00.370 align:middle line:84%
and then we just
forgot everything?

00:01:00.370 --> 00:01:04.269 align:middle line:84%
Did we start as monkeys and then
one day it was like, boop boop,

00:01:04.269 --> 00:01:05.830 align:middle line:90%
we got the gene upgrade.

00:01:05.830 --> 00:01:11.780 align:middle line:84%
OK, now we're going into full
on human gold production mode.

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:14.540 align:middle line:84%
Well, these are mysteries
that a lot of us

00:01:14.540 --> 00:01:15.890 align:middle line:90%
have focused on solving.

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:19.790 align:middle line:10%
And for me as a physicist
and a scientist,

00:01:19.790 --> 00:01:22.430 align:middle line:10%
I've been deeply
interested in getting down

00:01:22.430 --> 00:01:23.940 align:middle line:10%
to the nuts and bolts of it.

00:01:23.940 --> 00:01:26.960 align:middle line:10%
How do we actually
get some proof?

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:30.290 align:middle line:10%
What do we actually
use to create proof,

00:01:30.290 --> 00:01:34.440 align:middle line:10%
to create a clarity
about who we are?

00:01:34.440 --> 00:01:37.290 align:middle line:10%
And it's great if
we can channel it,

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:39.350 align:middle line:10%
it's great if we can
remember it from past lives,

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:42.080 align:middle line:10%
it's great if we
can find the keys

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:44.010 align:middle line:10%
to those secrets
with each other,

00:01:44.010 --> 00:01:47.060 align:middle line:10%
and it's also great when we
are given some solid ground

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:51.120 align:middle line:10%
to stand on because then we can
also teach other people, right.

00:01:51.120 --> 00:01:52.290 align:middle line:90%
Sound good?

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:55.390 align:middle line:84%
So I'm going to give you
some solid grounds here.

00:01:55.390 --> 00:01:59.910 align:middle line:84%
And to start with, let's
look at this incredible piece

00:01:59.910 --> 00:02:01.680 align:middle line:90%
of magic right here.

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:04.770 align:middle line:84%
This is the bent
pyramid in Egypt.

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:07.680 align:middle line:84%
The bent pyramid is
one that really just

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:10.169 align:middle line:84%
doesn't get that much fanfare
but when you go to it,

00:02:10.169 --> 00:02:14.130 align:middle line:90%
it's so phenomenal and amazing.

00:02:14.130 --> 00:02:16.430 align:middle line:84%
Not a lot of fanfare,
a lot of beauty.

00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:18.620 align:middle line:10%
When I went to this thing
for the first time, what

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:21.020 align:middle line:10%
astounded me the
most about this site

00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:27.460 align:middle line:10%
is that you find these sheets of
crystal, sheets of crystal that

00:02:27.460 --> 00:02:29.635 align:middle line:10%
have literally come off
the surface of this thing.

00:02:29.635 --> 00:02:33.100 align:middle line:10%
I have a bunch of them at home,
and they're about this thick,

00:02:33.100 --> 00:02:37.150 align:middle line:10%
perfectly clear as though the
whole structure at one point

00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:41.510 align:middle line:10%
was covered in glassy, beautiful
crystalline perfection.

00:02:41.510 --> 00:02:42.760 align:middle line:90%
Who the heck built this thing?

00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:43.750 align:middle line:90%
And why was it built?

00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:45.040 align:middle line:90%
And what is it all about?

00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:49.180 align:middle line:10%
The story in the mainstream is
that this structure was built

00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:51.467 align:middle line:10%
and they started making
this amazing pyramid

00:02:51.467 --> 00:02:53.050 align:middle line:10%
and halfway through
the guys are like,

00:02:53.050 --> 00:02:56.170 align:middle line:10%
oops, yeah, we
probably shouldn't

00:02:56.170 --> 00:02:57.370 align:middle line:10%
keep going at that angle.

00:02:57.370 --> 00:03:01.420 align:middle line:84%
Let's just accidentally--
let's change the angle.

00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:05.290 align:middle line:84%
And my friend Alan Green
who's right here actually

00:03:05.290 --> 00:03:06.790 align:middle line:90%
turned me on to this idea.

00:03:06.790 --> 00:03:10.120 align:middle line:84%
And he showed me-- he's
like, no, no, no, no,

00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:12.190 align:middle line:90%
this thing is not a mistake.

00:03:12.190 --> 00:03:16.450 align:middle line:84%
In fact, if you look at the
geometry of this structure,

00:03:16.450 --> 00:03:20.110 align:middle line:84%
the top portion of the
pyramid and the bottom portion

00:03:20.110 --> 00:03:24.370 align:middle line:84%
of the pyramid are each parts of
two different kinds of pyramids.

00:03:24.370 --> 00:03:29.110 align:middle line:84%
One has a perfect
pentagonal triangle,

00:03:29.110 --> 00:03:34.670 align:middle line:84%
the other one is actually a
perfect hexagonal triangle.

00:03:34.670 --> 00:03:39.400 align:middle line:84%
And so this pyramid embodies the
relationship between the five

00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:41.890 align:middle line:90%
six, the pentagram hexagram.

00:03:41.890 --> 00:03:44.380 align:middle line:84%
Now, if this is new
information to you

00:03:44.380 --> 00:03:48.010 align:middle line:84%
guys in terms of the importance
of these two geometries,

00:03:48.010 --> 00:03:51.280 align:middle line:84%
if you haven't had much
background in sacred geometry,

00:03:51.280 --> 00:03:55.030 align:middle line:84%
let me just tell you
everything in existence

00:03:55.030 --> 00:03:57.430 align:middle line:84%
basically comes out of
these two geometries.

00:03:57.430 --> 00:04:02.150 align:middle line:84%
Every single major
biological chemical

00:04:02.150 --> 00:04:06.920 align:middle line:84%
that operates our neurology
requires a combination

00:04:06.920 --> 00:04:09.710 align:middle line:84%
of a five six molecule
inside our bodies.

00:04:09.710 --> 00:04:11.180 align:middle line:84%
And as I'm going
to show you later,

00:04:11.180 --> 00:04:14.360 align:middle line:84%
it has everything to
do with mass, matter,

00:04:14.360 --> 00:04:16.690 align:middle line:90%
and the structure of reality.

00:04:16.690 --> 00:04:20.170 align:middle line:84%
Five pointed star is
literally the key in physics

00:04:20.170 --> 00:04:24.070 align:middle line:84%
to how space time curves
and we get gravity.

00:04:24.070 --> 00:04:27.790 align:middle line:84%
The geometry of the six is all
about how equilibrium can be

00:04:27.790 --> 00:04:30.720 align:middle line:90%
attained and electromagnetism.

00:04:30.720 --> 00:04:32.100 align:middle line:10%
This is Alan Green's work.

00:04:32.100 --> 00:04:33.930 align:middle line:10%
I showed you one of his slides.

00:04:33.930 --> 00:04:36.300 align:middle line:10%
You should get to
the rest of his work

00:04:36.300 --> 00:04:39.210 align:middle line:10%
because when you start
to unpack this mystery,

00:04:39.210 --> 00:04:41.070 align:middle line:10%
you start to understand
who Shakespeare

00:04:41.070 --> 00:04:44.850 align:middle line:10%
was and the encoding in the
pyramids and the knowledge

00:04:44.850 --> 00:04:46.500 align:middle line:10%
that he wove into his work.

00:04:46.500 --> 00:04:50.700 align:middle line:84%
Many, many mysteries
will unfold for you.

00:04:50.700 --> 00:04:53.580 align:middle line:84%
This is the cover of
Shakespeare's Sonnets.

00:04:53.580 --> 00:04:57.780 align:middle line:84%
How the heck did he
know or they know

00:04:57.780 --> 00:05:00.000 align:middle line:84%
about all of these
mathematical constants?

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:02.140 align:middle line:84%
Some of them weren't
even created yet.

00:05:02.140 --> 00:05:06.160 align:middle line:84%
So this is me in the Serapeum
in Egypt, me in Peru,

00:05:06.160 --> 00:05:07.300 align:middle line:90%
me in Bolivia.

00:05:07.300 --> 00:05:08.830 align:middle line:84%
And a lot of this
talk I'm actually

00:05:08.830 --> 00:05:11.290 align:middle line:84%
going to take you to
different amazing sacred sites

00:05:11.290 --> 00:05:14.380 align:middle line:84%
around the world and show
you some of these spaces

00:05:14.380 --> 00:05:16.990 align:middle line:84%
and tell you about some of
the experiences I've had,

00:05:16.990 --> 00:05:19.240 align:middle line:84%
and start to build
a picture for you

00:05:19.240 --> 00:05:21.940 align:middle line:84%
about the physics and the
engineering of these sites

00:05:21.940 --> 00:05:24.220 align:middle line:84%
and what it can show us
about our true history

00:05:24.220 --> 00:05:25.610 align:middle line:90%
and who we really are.

00:05:25.610 --> 00:05:29.830 align:middle line:10%
So to start with we shall
travel down deep to the South,

00:05:29.830 --> 00:05:33.790 align:middle line:10%
to the lands of Peru,
the realm of Cusco,

00:05:33.790 --> 00:05:38.230 align:middle line:10%
to the place called
Ollantaytambo.

00:05:38.230 --> 00:05:41.140 align:middle line:84%
How many people have been to
Ollantaytambo in this room?

00:05:41.140 --> 00:05:43.420 align:middle line:90%
Amazing, one, with me.

00:05:43.420 --> 00:05:44.290 align:middle line:90%
Awesome.

00:05:44.290 --> 00:05:47.930 align:middle line:10%
So in Ollantaytambo, we took
a group of students here.

00:05:47.930 --> 00:05:53.050 align:middle line:84%
You can see this massive,
massive wall that's just

00:05:53.050 --> 00:05:55.060 align:middle line:90%
on the side of the mountain.

00:05:55.060 --> 00:05:57.430 align:middle line:84%
And it's got terracing
down below it.

00:05:57.430 --> 00:05:59.080 align:middle line:84%
And you can see one
of my students here

00:05:59.080 --> 00:06:01.450 align:middle line:84%
and just the scale
of these stones.

00:06:01.450 --> 00:06:03.710 align:middle line:84%
Each of these
stones individually

00:06:03.710 --> 00:06:08.880 align:middle line:84%
weighs in the range
of 180 to 200 tons.

00:06:08.880 --> 00:06:10.850 align:middle line:90%
Now, a stone that size--

00:06:10.850 --> 00:06:13.888 align:middle line:84%
for clarity-- you put it
on the back of a semi truck

00:06:13.888 --> 00:06:15.930 align:middle line:84%
because you want to go
drive it around somewhere,

00:06:15.930 --> 00:06:20.420 align:middle line:84%
it will literally crush the
axles of the semi truck, OK.

00:06:20.420 --> 00:06:24.140 align:middle line:84%
And interestingly
enough, this stone

00:06:24.140 --> 00:06:28.820 align:middle line:84%
comes from another spot in
this picture, the other side

00:06:28.820 --> 00:06:31.280 align:middle line:90%
of the top of this peak.

00:06:31.280 --> 00:06:33.470 align:middle line:10%
Now there's a story
about the Incas

00:06:33.470 --> 00:06:37.820 align:middle line:10%
and the Incan king who decided
I would challenge the gods

00:06:37.820 --> 00:06:42.260 align:middle line:10%
and become a great god
myself if I can but retrieve

00:06:42.260 --> 00:06:44.840 align:middle line:10%
a stone from the top
of the sacred mountain

00:06:44.840 --> 00:06:50.120 align:middle line:10%
and bring it down and across
the valley and up the other side

00:06:50.120 --> 00:06:52.910 align:middle line:10%
and into position as a
part of this great temple

00:06:52.910 --> 00:06:55.500 align:middle line:10%
of Ollantaytambo
built by the gods.

00:06:55.500 --> 00:06:57.110 align:middle line:90%
So let me impress the gods.

00:06:57.110 --> 00:07:00.425 align:middle line:84%
I'll take my 200 warriors, you
know, badass guys up there.

00:07:00.425 --> 00:07:01.800 align:middle line:10%
We're going to
tie this thing up,

00:07:01.800 --> 00:07:04.270 align:middle line:10%
we're going to take
it down the mountain.

00:07:04.270 --> 00:07:08.570 align:middle line:84%
Well, my friends, the
story did not go so well.

00:07:08.570 --> 00:07:14.050 align:middle line:84%
That stone pulled 200 men down
the mountain, killing them.

00:07:14.050 --> 00:07:15.630 align:middle line:90%
So the king failed.

00:07:15.630 --> 00:07:19.710 align:middle line:10%
He failed to replicate
the work of the gods,

00:07:19.710 --> 00:07:23.100 align:middle line:10%
and yet the archeologists
knowing this story

00:07:23.100 --> 00:07:27.140 align:middle line:10%
still say the Incas
must have built this.

00:07:27.140 --> 00:07:28.760 align:middle line:10%
Now, I'll tell you
as we go around

00:07:28.760 --> 00:07:32.385 align:middle line:10%
through some of these sites
you'll see stone structures.

00:07:32.385 --> 00:07:34.760 align:middle line:84%
And if you go to these places
you'll see plenty of stones

00:07:34.760 --> 00:07:37.340 align:middle line:84%
where it's like, oh yeah,
I could pick up a stone

00:07:37.340 --> 00:07:40.040 align:middle line:84%
and I could put it on another
stone and make a stack.

00:07:40.040 --> 00:07:41.270 align:middle line:90%
No problem.

00:07:41.270 --> 00:07:43.660 align:middle line:90%
That's easy to do.

00:07:43.660 --> 00:07:48.690 align:middle line:84%
But how would I
liquefy granite such

00:07:48.690 --> 00:07:53.400 align:middle line:84%
that I could squeeze it
in to perfect curvature

00:07:53.400 --> 00:07:55.170 align:middle line:90%
between stones?

00:07:55.170 --> 00:07:57.690 align:middle line:10%
How would I shape a
stone so perfectly

00:07:57.690 --> 00:07:59.760 align:middle line:10%
that if I run a laser
down the line of it,

00:07:59.760 --> 00:08:03.750 align:middle line:10%
it deviates less than
a tiny millimeter?

00:08:03.750 --> 00:08:07.920 align:middle line:84%
How would I take the surface
of those gigantic stones I just

00:08:07.920 --> 00:08:11.320 align:middle line:84%
showed you and instead
of carving into it,

00:08:11.320 --> 00:08:15.690 align:middle line:84%
I would create designs that
stick out in relief from it?

00:08:15.690 --> 00:08:18.450 align:middle line:10%
Meaning I have to make the
entire rest of the surface

00:08:18.450 --> 00:08:23.850 align:middle line:10%
of the stone go in an exact
amount, like an exact amount,

00:08:23.850 --> 00:08:26.781 align:middle line:10%
to let that relief stick out.

00:08:26.781 --> 00:08:30.950 align:middle line:90%
Huh, I wonder.

00:08:30.950 --> 00:08:34.580 align:middle line:84%
And when we get a little
closer to these structures

00:08:34.580 --> 00:08:37.070 align:middle line:84%
and this technology,
you'll notice

00:08:37.070 --> 00:08:41.679 align:middle line:84%
where the stones have separated,
I mean, it is laser sharp.

00:08:41.679 --> 00:08:46.720 align:middle line:10%
It is not just like
smooth, it's laser sharp.

00:08:46.720 --> 00:08:52.600 align:middle line:10%
The edges are cut as if
cut by a saw or by plasma.

00:08:52.600 --> 00:08:56.230 align:middle line:10%
And the stones are
squished together.

00:08:56.230 --> 00:09:00.310 align:middle line:10%
There are silly like engineering
level interconnections

00:09:00.310 --> 00:09:01.150 align:middle line:10%
between the stones.

00:09:01.150 --> 00:09:03.790 align:middle line:84%
Stuff just you wouldn't
do as an engineer.

00:09:03.790 --> 00:09:08.380 align:middle line:84%
And then you notice that within
the structures of these things

00:09:08.380 --> 00:09:11.530 align:middle line:84%
you have areas where they
have these little slots,

00:09:11.530 --> 00:09:15.700 align:middle line:84%
and each one of the little
slots is a perfect size.

00:09:15.700 --> 00:09:19.240 align:middle line:84%
And it turns out if you get
someone's head in the slot,

00:09:19.240 --> 00:09:22.570 align:middle line:84%
they can tone inside
the slot like mmmm,

00:09:22.570 --> 00:09:24.374 align:middle line:90%
you know, you go [HUMMING].

00:09:24.374 --> 00:09:28.580 align:middle line:90%


00:09:28.580 --> 00:09:31.920 align:middle line:84%
And when they hit the
resonant frequency,

00:09:31.920 --> 00:09:33.680 align:middle line:84%
the whole slot
vibrates and their head

00:09:33.680 --> 00:09:35.730 align:middle line:90%
vibrates and it's really cool.

00:09:35.730 --> 00:09:42.098 align:middle line:84%
But, guess what, if you get them
all vibrating at the same time--

00:09:42.098 --> 00:09:43.890 align:middle line:84%
caught some of my
students still over there

00:09:43.890 --> 00:09:45.770 align:middle line:84%
after we like moved
on from this--

00:09:45.770 --> 00:09:49.520 align:middle line:84%
but the whole wall
starts vibrating.

00:09:49.520 --> 00:09:53.990 align:middle line:84%
It's like energy and
information and everything else

00:09:53.990 --> 00:09:56.630 align:middle line:90%
starts coming out of the wall.

00:09:56.630 --> 00:09:58.520 align:middle line:84%
People with their
heads in the wall

00:09:58.520 --> 00:10:01.900 align:middle line:84%
start going, oh my god,
I'm getting downloads.

00:10:01.900 --> 00:10:04.930 align:middle line:84%
And the question I held for
a long time is, what is it

00:10:04.930 --> 00:10:07.840 align:middle line:84%
about the resonance
of these structures

00:10:07.840 --> 00:10:11.590 align:middle line:84%
that enables people to
access certain information

00:10:11.590 --> 00:10:16.740 align:middle line:84%
and get downloads and things
just from vibrating with it?

00:10:16.740 --> 00:10:20.240 align:middle line:84%
I'm a physicist so I'm like,
that's a hard question.

00:10:20.240 --> 00:10:22.640 align:middle line:84%
We will solve that
question in this talk

00:10:22.640 --> 00:10:26.530 align:middle line:84%
if you hang out with me for
the next hour and a half.

00:10:26.530 --> 00:10:27.970 align:middle line:90%
So here's Sacsayhuaman.

00:10:27.970 --> 00:10:30.310 align:middle line:84%
This is another one of my
favorite sites in Peru.

00:10:30.310 --> 00:10:35.990 align:middle line:10%
Sacsayhuaman got these huge
stones that are-- they're

00:10:35.990 --> 00:10:39.530 align:middle line:10%
more like a lot of
them 60, 70 tons,

00:10:39.530 --> 00:10:42.620 align:middle line:10%
but there's the occasional stone
that's in the hundreds of tons

00:10:42.620 --> 00:10:43.920 align:middle line:10%
here as well.

00:10:43.920 --> 00:10:47.550 align:middle line:90%
And the walls just keep going.

00:10:47.550 --> 00:10:52.050 align:middle line:10%
I mean, it just keeps
going and going and going.

00:10:52.050 --> 00:10:54.330 align:middle line:10%
And you look at
the size of this.

00:10:54.330 --> 00:10:59.440 align:middle line:10%
I mean, this is me doing
a little video shot of it,

00:10:59.440 --> 00:11:02.130 align:middle line:10%
and it just gives
you the picture.

00:11:02.130 --> 00:11:07.230 align:middle line:10%
Now imagine all you've got
is some logs and some ropes

00:11:07.230 --> 00:11:09.430 align:middle line:10%
and a hammer and chisel.

00:11:09.430 --> 00:11:11.190 align:middle line:10%
That's your tool.

00:11:11.190 --> 00:11:14.050 align:middle line:10%
And you're going to build that?

00:11:14.050 --> 00:11:14.980 align:middle line:10%
Are you kidding me?

00:11:14.980 --> 00:11:18.420 align:middle line:90%


00:11:18.420 --> 00:11:21.200 align:middle line:90%
And look how big it is.

00:11:21.200 --> 00:11:25.880 align:middle line:10%
Wave after wave after
wave after wave.

00:11:25.880 --> 00:11:29.030 align:middle line:90%
And it wasn't defensive.

00:11:29.030 --> 00:11:31.760 align:middle line:84%
Like I could just walk over
here and get to the next level.

00:11:31.760 --> 00:11:34.040 align:middle line:90%
It's not a defensive position.

00:11:34.040 --> 00:11:38.450 align:middle line:84%
It's not like it serves some
intensely important purpose.

00:11:38.450 --> 00:11:40.280 align:middle line:84%
It's not like each
one of these has

00:11:40.280 --> 00:11:44.240 align:middle line:84%
a sacred magical amazing temple
put on top of those stones.

00:11:44.240 --> 00:11:46.500 align:middle line:90%
It's just a wall.

00:11:46.500 --> 00:11:48.250 align:middle line:90%
It's just a wall.

00:11:48.250 --> 00:11:50.130 align:middle line:84%
But it was built
like it was easy.

00:11:50.130 --> 00:11:52.960 align:middle line:90%


00:11:52.960 --> 00:11:57.370 align:middle line:10%
You have other sites around
Peru, places like the Moray

00:11:57.370 --> 00:12:01.360 align:middle line:10%
Ruins, and the archeologists
are like, yeah,

00:12:01.360 --> 00:12:04.520 align:middle line:10%
they're just terracing.

00:12:04.520 --> 00:12:08.360 align:middle line:90%
Why would you terrace like this?

00:12:08.360 --> 00:12:12.890 align:middle line:84%
And how is it that if you go
here and stand in the center,

00:12:12.890 --> 00:12:16.220 align:middle line:84%
you're in a perfect
resonant amphitheater.

00:12:16.220 --> 00:12:19.280 align:middle line:84%
All the sound bounces
back at you perfectly.

00:12:19.280 --> 00:12:23.540 align:middle line:84%
Now, sure, there's certainly
some awesome and interesting

00:12:23.540 --> 00:12:28.880 align:middle line:84%
science and physics
to the plant growth

00:12:28.880 --> 00:12:32.240 align:middle line:84%
that could happen if you
sang at the right notes,

00:12:32.240 --> 00:12:35.780 align:middle line:84%
you could stimulate
seed development, right,

00:12:35.780 --> 00:12:40.850 align:middle line:84%
but the sonic engineering
alone here is notable.

00:12:40.850 --> 00:12:45.200 align:middle line:84%
Like even the fact that we only
know, really, think about that

00:12:45.200 --> 00:12:48.530 align:middle line:84%
and know that now that certain
frequencies can stimulate plant

00:12:48.530 --> 00:12:50.690 align:middle line:84%
growth in specific
ways, and yet they

00:12:50.690 --> 00:12:52.670 align:middle line:90%
were doing it way back then.

00:12:52.670 --> 00:12:56.840 align:middle line:84%
Potentially way, way, way
earlier than the time period

00:12:56.840 --> 00:13:00.450 align:middle line:90%
that the archeologists tell us.

00:13:00.450 --> 00:13:04.270 align:middle line:84%
There is a secret
hidden in these sites.

00:13:04.270 --> 00:13:06.960 align:middle line:84%
They're trying to tell
us something about sound,

00:13:06.960 --> 00:13:11.220 align:middle line:84%
about consciousness,
perhaps about cymatics,

00:13:11.220 --> 00:13:15.960 align:middle line:84%
how matter and form can
shape itself and change

00:13:15.960 --> 00:13:18.240 align:middle line:90%
based on vibration.

00:13:18.240 --> 00:13:22.410 align:middle line:84%
And maybe there's more
even to it than that.

00:13:22.410 --> 00:13:25.770 align:middle line:10%
Maybe the vibrational
magic of these sites

00:13:25.770 --> 00:13:28.650 align:middle line:10%
is actually just
intended to help open

00:13:28.650 --> 00:13:33.390 align:middle line:10%
our eyes and unlock something,
information perhaps hidden

00:13:33.390 --> 00:13:36.450 align:middle line:10%
in these sites,
part of ourselves

00:13:36.450 --> 00:13:41.910 align:middle line:10%
to reclaim some aspect of
who we really are as people.

00:13:41.910 --> 00:13:51.420 align:middle line:84%
Now, powerful vibrations, wave
fields, big magic of creation,

00:13:51.420 --> 00:13:53.280 align:middle line:84%
we end up kind of
looking at some

00:13:53.280 --> 00:13:56.280 align:middle line:84%
of these interesting
ancient cultural ideas.

00:13:56.280 --> 00:13:59.010 align:middle line:84%
Like the Ark of the
Covenant, this thing

00:13:59.010 --> 00:14:03.090 align:middle line:84%
that had this powerful field
around it, so resonant you

00:14:03.090 --> 00:14:05.430 align:middle line:84%
couldn't even get into
its space unless you

00:14:05.430 --> 00:14:07.920 align:middle line:84%
were in the right
kind of energy state.

00:14:07.920 --> 00:14:11.950 align:middle line:84%
An initiatory
field of resonance.

00:14:11.950 --> 00:14:14.710 align:middle line:84%
But when you get deeper into
questions about things like

00:14:14.710 --> 00:14:17.460 align:middle line:84%
the Ark of the Covenant-- and
many other speakers talk on this

00:14:17.460 --> 00:14:19.420 align:middle line:84%
so I'm just going to
move through it quickly--

00:14:19.420 --> 00:14:24.710 align:middle line:84%
what you find is that all of
them point to not the Ark box

00:14:24.710 --> 00:14:27.350 align:middle line:90%
but what's inside the Ark.

00:14:27.350 --> 00:14:29.570 align:middle line:84%
And what's inside
the Ark is often

00:14:29.570 --> 00:14:32.860 align:middle line:90%
described as the Black Sunstone.

00:14:32.860 --> 00:14:36.670 align:middle line:84%
A Black stone of some
kind that had the power

00:14:36.670 --> 00:14:41.290 align:middle line:84%
to control weather, that had
the power to lay people low,

00:14:41.290 --> 00:14:43.960 align:middle line:90%
had the power to shift the land.

00:14:43.960 --> 00:14:48.820 align:middle line:84%
Very, very, very powerful
thing, an energetic device,

00:14:48.820 --> 00:14:51.730 align:middle line:90%
an advanced device of some kind.

00:14:51.730 --> 00:14:55.510 align:middle line:84%
And perhaps there
wasn't just one of them.

00:14:55.510 --> 00:14:57.610 align:middle line:84%
There are keys
and little stories

00:14:57.610 --> 00:15:00.250 align:middle line:84%
and little bits that suggest
that there may have actually

00:15:00.250 --> 00:15:03.700 align:middle line:84%
been many of these in
different parts of the world.

00:15:03.700 --> 00:15:06.030 align:middle line:10%
Well, as I'm
traveling through Peru

00:15:06.030 --> 00:15:09.680 align:middle line:10%
I come across this
spot in Pisac.

00:15:09.680 --> 00:15:14.450 align:middle line:10%
And here in Pisac you
find this beautiful sort

00:15:14.450 --> 00:15:17.420 align:middle line:10%
of layered temple structure
across a mountain ridge.

00:15:17.420 --> 00:15:20.120 align:middle line:10%
And when you get to the far
back side of that mountain

00:15:20.120 --> 00:15:25.310 align:middle line:10%
ridge, the most tucked in, most
secure, most protected temple

00:15:25.310 --> 00:15:29.310 align:middle line:10%
in the structure,
you get to this area.

00:15:29.310 --> 00:15:31.660 align:middle line:84%
And the stones are
very different.

00:15:31.660 --> 00:15:34.150 align:middle line:84%
Can you see the stones
here in the corner?

00:15:34.150 --> 00:15:35.750 align:middle line:90%
This is Inca.

00:15:35.750 --> 00:15:39.250 align:middle line:84%
Look at these, not a
gap, not a feather.

00:15:39.250 --> 00:15:43.240 align:middle line:84%
They are perfectly
placed together.

00:15:43.240 --> 00:15:45.910 align:middle line:84%
And you see that
spot right there?

00:15:45.910 --> 00:15:48.780 align:middle line:90%
Zoom in on that guy.

00:15:48.780 --> 00:15:53.070 align:middle line:84%
This rounded chamber
with the special gate

00:15:53.070 --> 00:15:56.910 align:middle line:90%
in it surrounds this mound.

00:15:56.910 --> 00:15:58.740 align:middle line:90%
And what is this mound?

00:15:58.740 --> 00:16:02.290 align:middle line:84%
It's got this little central
peak thing sticking out of it.

00:16:02.290 --> 00:16:04.750 align:middle line:10%
But when you get close
to it and you look at it,

00:16:04.750 --> 00:16:10.300 align:middle line:10%
you realize it's melted rock.

00:16:10.300 --> 00:16:11.770 align:middle line:10%
It's igneous.

00:16:11.770 --> 00:16:15.280 align:middle line:10%
It was literally liquefied rock.

00:16:15.280 --> 00:16:21.610 align:middle line:84%
It turned into magma or lava
and poured out of the temple.

00:16:21.610 --> 00:16:24.580 align:middle line:84%
Now, this is not a
volcano and nobody's

00:16:24.580 --> 00:16:28.390 align:middle line:84%
going to take buckets of magma
and pour them in a temple,

00:16:28.390 --> 00:16:29.470 align:middle line:90%
are they?

00:16:29.470 --> 00:16:30.890 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:16:30.890 --> 00:16:35.670 align:middle line:10%
So how the heck was the central
structure of this temple

00:16:35.670 --> 00:16:39.500 align:middle line:10%
so superheated that the
whole thing literally

00:16:39.500 --> 00:16:41.630 align:middle line:10%
melted the rock itself?

00:16:41.630 --> 00:16:44.030 align:middle line:84%
And it melted so
much it literally

00:16:44.030 --> 00:16:45.350 align:middle line:90%
pours out of the temple.

00:16:45.350 --> 00:16:48.510 align:middle line:90%


00:16:48.510 --> 00:16:51.050 align:middle line:84%
I think this is a
position of one of the Ark

00:16:51.050 --> 00:16:53.690 align:middle line:84%
stones during the
pre-diluvian civilization,

00:16:53.690 --> 00:16:57.010 align:middle line:84%
just to get straight
to the point.

00:16:57.010 --> 00:17:00.120 align:middle line:10%
And when you look at this
area, as well as many

00:17:00.120 --> 00:17:04.290 align:middle line:10%
of other areas around
Peru, what you'll see

00:17:04.290 --> 00:17:07.109 align:middle line:10%
is this very clearly
regulated system.

00:17:07.109 --> 00:17:11.819 align:middle line:10%
They will run water channels
in very specific ways,

00:17:11.819 --> 00:17:15.839 align:middle line:10%
with very specific geometry,
and they run those channels

00:17:15.839 --> 00:17:20.910 align:middle line:10%
to very specific positions
around the core placements

00:17:20.910 --> 00:17:22.710 align:middle line:10%
of these key temples.

00:17:22.710 --> 00:17:26.490 align:middle line:10%
So water plays a big
role, but in this can also

00:17:26.490 --> 00:17:27.839 align:middle line:10%
see that magma way more.

00:17:27.839 --> 00:17:29.010 align:middle line:10%
You see that?

00:17:29.010 --> 00:17:34.650 align:middle line:10%
Look at this, layers upon layers
where molten rock flowed out

00:17:34.650 --> 00:17:37.170 align:middle line:10%
of that.

00:17:37.170 --> 00:17:39.110 align:middle line:10%
Crazy, right?

00:17:39.110 --> 00:17:44.430 align:middle line:84%
So maybe that's a spot where one
of the Ark stones used to be.

00:17:44.430 --> 00:17:50.250 align:middle line:84%
And perhaps that Ark stone at
some point ignited, blew up.

00:17:50.250 --> 00:17:54.420 align:middle line:84%
Something went wrong, energy
overload, temple core meltdown,

00:17:54.420 --> 00:17:58.400 align:middle line:90%
beep, beep, beep, beep, right?

00:17:58.400 --> 00:18:00.812 align:middle line:84%
Now Machu Picchu,
very well known place.

00:18:00.812 --> 00:18:02.270 align:middle line:10%
Everybody talks
about Machu Picchu.

00:18:02.270 --> 00:18:04.190 align:middle line:10%
Everybody goes to Machu Picchu.

00:18:04.190 --> 00:18:06.380 align:middle line:10%
But interestingly
in Machu Picchu

00:18:06.380 --> 00:18:09.940 align:middle line:10%
you have a central
zone of the temple

00:18:09.940 --> 00:18:12.010 align:middle line:10%
with the same exact structure.

00:18:12.010 --> 00:18:14.500 align:middle line:84%
Looks like it's
designed or positioned

00:18:14.500 --> 00:18:18.430 align:middle line:84%
to hold some kind of
central power object.

00:18:18.430 --> 00:18:21.580 align:middle line:84%
Power object that is
placed in such a way as

00:18:21.580 --> 00:18:25.330 align:middle line:84%
to have access to the
entire city structure.

00:18:25.330 --> 00:18:28.040 align:middle line:84%
That's where you put a
generator, basically.

00:18:28.040 --> 00:18:31.870 align:middle line:84%
And in this case all the
walls and the structures

00:18:31.870 --> 00:18:37.060 align:middle line:84%
around that spot are
gone, pretty much.

00:18:37.060 --> 00:18:39.320 align:middle line:84%
Most of them are
basically blown away.

00:18:39.320 --> 00:18:41.680 align:middle line:10%
So you're looking from
this spot and you just

00:18:41.680 --> 00:18:45.710 align:middle line:10%
have this beautiful
view of the valley.

00:18:45.710 --> 00:18:50.910 align:middle line:10%
But as you go a little further
down just off of that ledge,

00:18:50.910 --> 00:18:55.460 align:middle line:10%
what you end up finding is all
of the structures around that

00:18:55.460 --> 00:18:59.630 align:middle line:10%
particular spot are these
super advanced well packed

00:18:59.630 --> 00:19:01.100 align:middle line:10%
in stone structures.

00:19:01.100 --> 00:19:04.130 align:middle line:10%
It's like they had
the whole thing set up

00:19:04.130 --> 00:19:07.490 align:middle line:10%
to contain and support
this massive energy system,

00:19:07.490 --> 00:19:10.930 align:middle line:10%
but at some point
something went wrong.

00:19:10.930 --> 00:19:14.200 align:middle line:10%
And the energy system
was removed or blew up.

00:19:14.200 --> 00:19:15.730 align:middle line:90%
No walls knocked down.

00:19:15.730 --> 00:19:17.770 align:middle line:84%
Maybe it had a different
kind of reaction

00:19:17.770 --> 00:19:19.610 align:middle line:90%
or was taken somewhere else.

00:19:19.610 --> 00:19:23.560 align:middle line:84%
So we don't have a
giant magma field.

00:19:23.560 --> 00:19:26.810 align:middle line:84%
And you can go Machu
Picchu and see this.

00:19:26.810 --> 00:19:29.260 align:middle line:84%
And it's really, really
potent when you're there

00:19:29.260 --> 00:19:32.770 align:middle line:84%
to notice the difference
between the stacks of rock

00:19:32.770 --> 00:19:38.830 align:middle line:84%
that are clearly Inca stacks,
and these other kinds of rock

00:19:38.830 --> 00:19:42.520 align:middle line:84%
where the stone is literally
molded into the landscape.

00:19:42.520 --> 00:19:44.590 align:middle line:90%
It's just designed perfectly.

00:19:44.590 --> 00:19:50.660 align:middle line:84%
It's every single placement
put in order and in position.

00:19:50.660 --> 00:19:54.330 align:middle line:84%
Now, we traveled from
Peru down to Bolivia.

00:19:54.330 --> 00:19:55.880 align:middle line:84%
And there's many
other amazing things

00:19:55.880 --> 00:19:59.820 align:middle line:84%
I could tell you about Peru, but
I've got to keep this moving.

00:19:59.820 --> 00:20:02.750 align:middle line:84%
And as we travel
down into Bolivia,

00:20:02.750 --> 00:20:05.600 align:middle line:84%
I noticed something really
interesting about the Andes

00:20:05.600 --> 00:20:08.670 align:middle line:90%
on either side of the road.

00:20:08.670 --> 00:20:12.480 align:middle line:84%
And that is that there is
evidence of old terracing

00:20:12.480 --> 00:20:13.680 align:middle line:90%
on the mountains.

00:20:13.680 --> 00:20:15.960 align:middle line:84%
Now, we have evidence
of Incan terracing.

00:20:15.960 --> 00:20:18.360 align:middle line:84%
And Incan and terracing
has mostly survived.

00:20:18.360 --> 00:20:21.180 align:middle line:84%
It's not actually
even really that old.

00:20:21.180 --> 00:20:25.560 align:middle line:84%
But the terracing on the
Andes between Peru and Bolivia

00:20:25.560 --> 00:20:28.840 align:middle line:84%
as you travel
there, doesn't just

00:20:28.840 --> 00:20:31.240 align:middle line:84%
go in the bottom
of the mountains

00:20:31.240 --> 00:20:33.630 align:middle line:90%
like the Inca terraces do.

00:20:33.630 --> 00:20:40.750 align:middle line:10%
The terracing on these mountains
goes all the way to the top.

00:20:40.750 --> 00:20:42.460 align:middle line:10%
Can you see all those lines?

00:20:42.460 --> 00:20:44.690 align:middle line:10%
All those terrace lines?

00:20:44.690 --> 00:20:49.480 align:middle line:10%
And this is every mountain
all the way there.

00:20:49.480 --> 00:20:55.110 align:middle line:84%
And you ask the archeologists
and they're like, well,

00:20:55.110 --> 00:20:58.950 align:middle line:84%
we think there was
like two million Incas.

00:20:58.950 --> 00:21:04.590 align:middle line:84%
So maybe it's this big
breadbasket for all the Incas.

00:21:04.590 --> 00:21:07.770 align:middle line:84%
They were just growing
stuff on the mountains.

00:21:07.770 --> 00:21:13.650 align:middle line:84%
I'm like, two million Incas and
you've got these beautiful, rich

00:21:13.650 --> 00:21:16.670 align:middle line:90%
lush valleys.

00:21:16.670 --> 00:21:19.880 align:middle line:84%
But let's really
get real about this.

00:21:19.880 --> 00:21:22.010 align:middle line:90%
I live here.

00:21:22.010 --> 00:21:25.380 align:middle line:10%
Each one of those things
is taller than a human,

00:21:25.380 --> 00:21:32.710 align:middle line:10%
but I'm going to plant my
cucumbers way up there.

00:21:32.710 --> 00:21:37.840 align:middle line:84%
In fact, I'm going to
have different food

00:21:37.840 --> 00:21:42.190 align:middle line:84%
for different times of year
going from the base of the Andes

00:21:42.190 --> 00:21:43.540 align:middle line:90%
to the top of the Andes.

00:21:43.540 --> 00:21:48.580 align:middle line:84%
I mean, some of these mountains
go up thousands and thousands

00:21:48.580 --> 00:21:50.380 align:middle line:90%
of feet.

00:21:50.380 --> 00:21:53.150 align:middle line:90%
Massive vertical drop.

00:21:53.150 --> 00:21:56.180 align:middle line:84%
And yet they had
terracing at the top?

00:21:56.180 --> 00:21:59.340 align:middle line:84%
How are you even going to keep
up with the garden like that?

00:21:59.340 --> 00:22:01.340 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't matter how
many people you have.

00:22:01.340 --> 00:22:05.840 align:middle line:84%
You got guys over a span
of 100 miles or more going

00:22:05.840 --> 00:22:09.320 align:middle line:84%
up and down from the top to the
bottom of the mountain to farm?

00:22:09.320 --> 00:22:10.680 align:middle line:90%
It doesn't make sense.

00:22:10.680 --> 00:22:12.980 align:middle line:90%
It doesn't make sense.

00:22:12.980 --> 00:22:15.890 align:middle line:84%
A few more shots of some of
the glimpses of the terracing

00:22:15.890 --> 00:22:18.420 align:middle line:90%
as you're in that drive.

00:22:18.420 --> 00:22:20.130 align:middle line:84%
And, of course, when
you get to Bolivia,

00:22:20.130 --> 00:22:23.150 align:middle line:84%
you get to a place
called Pumapunku.

00:22:23.150 --> 00:22:28.070 align:middle line:84%
Pumapunku is this
incredibly advanced site,

00:22:28.070 --> 00:22:33.920 align:middle line:84%
but it is so destroyed that
literally all that's left now

00:22:33.920 --> 00:22:38.060 align:middle line:84%
is basically a bunch of the
blocks just kind of sat around,

00:22:38.060 --> 00:22:41.122 align:middle line:84%
strewn around by the
archeologists that

00:22:41.122 --> 00:22:42.830 align:middle line:84%
found them and was
just like, yeah, let's

00:22:42.830 --> 00:22:45.650 align:middle line:90%
just put that there, I guess.

00:22:45.650 --> 00:22:48.890 align:middle line:84%
The thing is
completely wiped out.

00:22:48.890 --> 00:22:52.870 align:middle line:84%
But the level of technology
used to build the structures

00:22:52.870 --> 00:22:56.860 align:middle line:84%
at Pumapunku, we have no idea
how they could pull that off.

00:22:56.860 --> 00:22:59.910 align:middle line:90%
Do you see this?

00:22:59.910 --> 00:23:04.010 align:middle line:10%
This is a laser
sharp array perfectly

00:23:04.010 --> 00:23:08.360 align:middle line:10%
with what look like screw
holes built into it,

00:23:08.360 --> 00:23:11.480 align:middle line:10%
bored into the granite, right.

00:23:11.480 --> 00:23:15.530 align:middle line:10%
I mean the angle, the precision,
everything about it is crazy.

00:23:15.530 --> 00:23:17.690 align:middle line:10%
And people don't even
talk about that stone,

00:23:17.690 --> 00:23:21.180 align:middle line:10%
they talk about
these, the H stones.

00:23:21.180 --> 00:23:23.060 align:middle line:10%
Probably seen these
in people's books.

00:23:23.060 --> 00:23:25.730 align:middle line:10%
And they are
remarkable, for sure,

00:23:25.730 --> 00:23:27.950 align:middle line:10%
but I found it even
more interesting

00:23:27.950 --> 00:23:30.560 align:middle line:10%
that a lot of the
gigantic megaliths that

00:23:30.560 --> 00:23:35.810 align:middle line:10%
were on the ground had
these pieces missing

00:23:35.810 --> 00:23:40.240 align:middle line:10%
that used to be some kind of
bridge between the stones.

00:23:40.240 --> 00:23:44.700 align:middle line:84%
Why would you have some kind
of heavy-duty anchor like that

00:23:44.700 --> 00:23:46.020 align:middle line:90%
between a massive--

00:23:46.020 --> 00:23:48.810 align:middle line:90%
two massive megalithic stones?

00:23:48.810 --> 00:23:51.780 align:middle line:10%
Well, if you get to know
the physics of vibration

00:23:51.780 --> 00:23:54.990 align:middle line:10%
and resonance, you realize that
if you want to connect stones

00:23:54.990 --> 00:23:56.910 align:middle line:10%
together in a
resonant frequency,

00:23:56.910 --> 00:24:00.990 align:middle line:10%
you need a particular
anchor in a specific size

00:24:00.990 --> 00:24:04.750 align:middle line:10%
to link the stones to pass
the resonance between them.

00:24:04.750 --> 00:24:07.440 align:middle line:84%
The same is true as if
there's charge in the stone.

00:24:07.440 --> 00:24:09.990 align:middle line:84%
Say there's a strong
electromagnetic charge,

00:24:09.990 --> 00:24:12.600 align:middle line:84%
you want the charge to
pass between the stones,

00:24:12.600 --> 00:24:14.680 align:middle line:90%
you would do the same thing.

00:24:14.680 --> 00:24:17.700 align:middle line:84%
So whether it's charge or
whether it's resonance,

00:24:17.700 --> 00:24:21.450 align:middle line:84%
the entire structure is
built in such a way as

00:24:21.450 --> 00:24:24.930 align:middle line:84%
to connect these different
stone structures together

00:24:24.930 --> 00:24:26.880 align:middle line:90%
to create a resonant field.

00:24:26.880 --> 00:24:31.770 align:middle line:84%
But whatever happened at
Pumapunku was so powerful,

00:24:31.770 --> 00:24:33.750 align:middle line:90%
was such big energy.

00:24:33.750 --> 00:24:37.680 align:middle line:84%
It's not like it just
aged and got into ruins.

00:24:37.680 --> 00:24:42.630 align:middle line:84%
The entire temple
structure went, boom.

00:24:42.630 --> 00:24:46.110 align:middle line:90%
The walls flew off.

00:24:46.110 --> 00:24:51.490 align:middle line:84%
Whatever it used to look
like, we have no clue now

00:24:51.490 --> 00:24:56.620 align:middle line:84%
because it was decimated by the
power of the energy source that

00:24:56.620 --> 00:24:58.490 align:middle line:90%
was there.

00:24:58.490 --> 00:25:02.572 align:middle line:84%
Yet, again, we're
seeing this evidence.

00:25:02.572 --> 00:25:04.230 align:middle line:10%
Oh, and you know, of
course, there just

00:25:04.230 --> 00:25:08.760 align:middle line:10%
happens to be a perfectly
round beveled piece coming out

00:25:08.760 --> 00:25:12.570 align:middle line:10%
of a stone here or another
perfectly round stone there

00:25:12.570 --> 00:25:16.390 align:middle line:10%
or a gate that's strangely
like, what is that?

00:25:16.390 --> 00:25:17.190 align:middle line:10%
A portal?

00:25:17.190 --> 00:25:17.990 align:middle line:10%
I don't know.

00:25:17.990 --> 00:25:19.620 align:middle line:10%
What are these missing things?

00:25:19.620 --> 00:25:21.570 align:middle line:10%
Why does it have
missing components

00:25:21.570 --> 00:25:22.920 align:middle line:10%
on the front and the back?

00:25:22.920 --> 00:25:25.630 align:middle line:10%
Why is it that when our
students go and walk through it

00:25:25.630 --> 00:25:28.530 align:middle line:10%
they feel like they're
passing through the plains

00:25:28.530 --> 00:25:30.780 align:middle line:10%
or that there's some
kind of gateway of energy

00:25:30.780 --> 00:25:32.100 align:middle line:10%
that used to be there?

00:25:32.100 --> 00:25:36.987 align:middle line:84%
What is really
going on after all?

00:25:36.987 --> 00:25:38.820 align:middle line:84%
I want you to keep that
mystery in your mind

00:25:38.820 --> 00:25:43.440 align:middle line:84%
as we now travel far
across the Atlantic Sea

00:25:43.440 --> 00:25:51.000 align:middle line:84%
and arrive in the epic lands of
Egypt, Kemet, the dark lands,

00:25:51.000 --> 00:25:54.410 align:middle line:90%
the place of so much mystery.

00:25:54.410 --> 00:25:58.850 align:middle line:10%
And here you see the same
structures, perfectly

00:25:58.850 --> 00:26:03.440 align:middle line:10%
round carvings, you know,
perfectly designed stone

00:26:03.440 --> 00:26:07.370 align:middle line:10%
structures, things that are
pretty much impossible to do

00:26:07.370 --> 00:26:09.050 align:middle line:10%
with a hammer and chisel.

00:26:09.050 --> 00:26:11.750 align:middle line:84%
And it gets really
interesting when

00:26:11.750 --> 00:26:16.170 align:middle line:84%
you consider stuff like
these rose granite pillars.

00:26:16.170 --> 00:26:17.730 align:middle line:90%
I was there with an engineer.

00:26:17.730 --> 00:26:19.560 align:middle line:84%
We looked at this
rose granite pillar,

00:26:19.560 --> 00:26:22.920 align:middle line:84%
it's big enough that you
basically take about four people

00:26:22.920 --> 00:26:25.350 align:middle line:90%
to wrap your arms around it, OK.

00:26:25.350 --> 00:26:27.690 align:middle line:84%
And it's one thing
to make a pillar,

00:26:27.690 --> 00:26:32.400 align:middle line:84%
it's one thing to just
carve something round,

00:26:32.400 --> 00:26:35.130 align:middle line:84%
but it's a different thing
to carve something that's

00:26:35.130 --> 00:26:43.800 align:middle line:84%
not only round but is perfectly
round and tapers as it goes up.

00:26:43.800 --> 00:26:46.680 align:middle line:90%
It changes diameter.

00:26:46.680 --> 00:26:50.500 align:middle line:84%
In order to engineer
a pillar like this

00:26:50.500 --> 00:26:53.340 align:middle line:84%
you need a turntable
the size of a freight

00:26:53.340 --> 00:26:56.520 align:middle line:90%
train to rotate the stone.

00:26:56.520 --> 00:27:00.800 align:middle line:84%
You need a two story
tall diamond saw.

00:27:00.800 --> 00:27:03.920 align:middle line:84%
You better spin that
thing at thousands of RPM

00:27:03.920 --> 00:27:06.650 align:middle line:84%
because you got to slice this
rose granite without chipping

00:27:06.650 --> 00:27:10.610 align:middle line:90%
it, sending cracks through it.

00:27:10.610 --> 00:27:12.800 align:middle line:90%
Rose granite cracks, OK.

00:27:12.800 --> 00:27:17.190 align:middle line:84%
And then you got to
angle it just right.

00:27:17.190 --> 00:27:19.920 align:middle line:84%
So you got to spin this
gargantuan amount of stone

00:27:19.920 --> 00:27:22.140 align:middle line:84%
while you're cutting it,
while you're angling it.

00:27:22.140 --> 00:27:25.050 align:middle line:84%
You need some
serious engineering.

00:27:25.050 --> 00:27:27.390 align:middle line:10%
And then for the
heck of it, let's

00:27:27.390 --> 00:27:30.060 align:middle line:10%
just not even keep
it a regular pillar,

00:27:30.060 --> 00:27:34.950 align:middle line:10%
let's add layers of these
beautiful articulations,

00:27:34.950 --> 00:27:38.010 align:middle line:10%
ostrich feathers or
Lotus petals at the top--

00:27:38.010 --> 00:27:40.420 align:middle line:10%
and just flare it
out at the top.

00:27:40.420 --> 00:27:42.570 align:middle line:10%
It's freaking astounding.

00:27:42.570 --> 00:27:44.160 align:middle line:10%
It's really astounding.

00:27:44.160 --> 00:27:48.420 align:middle line:10%
And everybody talks
about the Sphinx and--

00:27:48.420 --> 00:27:50.530 align:middle line:10%
Robert Schoch is a
good friend of mine.

00:27:50.530 --> 00:27:51.870 align:middle line:90%
I love his work.

00:27:51.870 --> 00:27:53.340 align:middle line:90%
He's just a genius.

00:27:53.340 --> 00:27:56.220 align:middle line:84%
And the Sphinx gets
all this attention.

00:27:56.220 --> 00:27:58.530 align:middle line:10%
The Sphinx is all
worn down, and there's

00:27:58.530 --> 00:28:03.470 align:middle line:10%
all of this mystery to
it because clearly it's

00:28:03.470 --> 00:28:06.320 align:middle line:10%
been rebuilt and rebuilt and
rebuilt and rebuilt and rebuilt.

00:28:06.320 --> 00:28:11.470 align:middle line:84%
But hardly anybody talks
about the Sphinx temple.

00:28:11.470 --> 00:28:14.080 align:middle line:84%
The Sphinx temple right
next to the Sphinx,

00:28:14.080 --> 00:28:17.370 align:middle line:84%
do you see the size of
the stones of this thing?

00:28:17.370 --> 00:28:19.010 align:middle line:90%
I mean, look at that one.

00:28:19.010 --> 00:28:22.760 align:middle line:10%
That's a 200-ton
block, at least, right.

00:28:22.760 --> 00:28:28.120 align:middle line:10%
And then there happens to be
this little guy, this one right

00:28:28.120 --> 00:28:28.920 align:middle line:10%
there.

00:28:28.920 --> 00:28:32.820 align:middle line:10%
I think we can close
up on that one, yep.

00:28:32.820 --> 00:28:35.840 align:middle line:10%
Take a look at that
stone for a second.

00:28:35.840 --> 00:28:38.040 align:middle line:10%
This used to be the facade.

00:28:38.040 --> 00:28:42.480 align:middle line:10%
This was what was on the
outside somewhere up the front.

00:28:42.480 --> 00:28:46.710 align:middle line:84%
Now, yeah, for sure it's an
interesting smoothly curved

00:28:46.710 --> 00:28:47.510 align:middle line:90%
stone.

00:28:47.510 --> 00:28:52.440 align:middle line:10%
And yet again they're like,
OK, so smooth curved stone, but

00:28:52.440 --> 00:28:58.500 align:middle line:10%
engineering that
kind of curve, to do

00:28:58.500 --> 00:29:04.010 align:middle line:10%
that kind of curve on stone, and
not just stone but really hard

00:29:04.010 --> 00:29:07.160 align:middle line:10%
granite, and not just granite
but-- and not just one spot

00:29:07.160 --> 00:29:13.590 align:middle line:10%
but doing it around an entire
massive temple structure,

00:29:13.590 --> 00:29:17.180 align:middle line:10%
no, no.

00:29:17.180 --> 00:29:18.710 align:middle line:10%
I'm sorry, we don't do that.

00:29:18.710 --> 00:29:20.780 align:middle line:90%
We can't do that now.

00:29:20.780 --> 00:29:21.740 align:middle line:90%
Do you understand?

00:29:21.740 --> 00:29:26.200 align:middle line:10%
We do not know how
to do that now.

00:29:26.200 --> 00:29:27.000 align:middle line:10%
Right?

00:29:27.000 --> 00:29:29.280 align:middle line:10%
So when you see in
the Luxor and you

00:29:29.280 --> 00:29:34.820 align:middle line:10%
see these interesting facades
and stuff, it is not granite

00:29:34.820 --> 00:29:39.140 align:middle line:10%
and it will never be curved
like that if it is granite.

00:29:39.140 --> 00:29:41.720 align:middle line:10%
We do not have those
engineering abilities.

00:29:41.720 --> 00:29:44.900 align:middle line:10%
And when you look inside
the temple, I mean,

00:29:44.900 --> 00:29:47.540 align:middle line:10%
the floor is alabaster.

00:29:47.540 --> 00:29:50.825 align:middle line:84%
For God's sake, I mean it
must have been so gorgeous.

00:29:50.825 --> 00:29:53.900 align:middle line:84%
The thing would
have glowed, right.

00:29:53.900 --> 00:29:56.720 align:middle line:84%
You ever been in an
alabaster spa where

00:29:56.720 --> 00:29:59.210 align:middle line:84%
they have light
behind the alabaster

00:29:59.210 --> 00:30:02.060 align:middle line:84%
and you get the golden
light inside of there?

00:30:02.060 --> 00:30:03.597 align:middle line:90%
I want one of those.

00:30:03.597 --> 00:30:06.490 align:middle line:90%
Manifestation board right there.

00:30:06.490 --> 00:30:09.280 align:middle line:10%
And you have these
beautiful spaces

00:30:09.280 --> 00:30:14.350 align:middle line:10%
and these towering stones,
and they're just so

00:30:14.350 --> 00:30:15.970 align:middle line:10%
artfully put together.

00:30:15.970 --> 00:30:18.460 align:middle line:10%
And, of course, they
don't just stack them,

00:30:18.460 --> 00:30:20.110 align:middle line:10%
you could do Lincoln Logs.

00:30:20.110 --> 00:30:24.400 align:middle line:10%
But why do Lincoln Logs when
I can take 150-ton stone

00:30:24.400 --> 00:30:28.990 align:middle line:10%
and curve it into the next wall?

00:30:28.990 --> 00:30:33.650 align:middle line:84%
I'll just do that
because, hey, it's easy.

00:30:33.650 --> 00:30:37.090 align:middle line:84%
It's so easy to do,
I'll do whatever.

00:30:37.090 --> 00:30:40.020 align:middle line:84%
I'll just do it
all over the place.

00:30:40.020 --> 00:30:42.810 align:middle line:90%
They'll love it.

00:30:42.810 --> 00:30:45.370 align:middle line:10%
You can imagine the guy,
the carver with the hammer

00:30:45.370 --> 00:30:48.780 align:middle line:10%
and chisel and the
pharaoh's like, OK,

00:30:48.780 --> 00:30:50.880 align:middle line:10%
now I want you to make a curve.

00:30:50.880 --> 00:30:54.390 align:middle line:84%
Then he's like,
oh god, you know.

00:30:54.390 --> 00:30:56.970 align:middle line:84%
And he's like just
chiseling away.

00:30:56.970 --> 00:30:59.640 align:middle line:90%
No, didn't happen that way.

00:30:59.640 --> 00:31:00.750 align:middle line:90%
Sorry, guys.

00:31:00.750 --> 00:31:04.630 align:middle line:84%
And then you've got the middle
of the empty desert place.

00:31:04.630 --> 00:31:07.650 align:middle line:84%
One of my favorite spots
called the Serapeum.

00:31:07.650 --> 00:31:09.697 align:middle line:84%
It's out between
Saqqara and Giza.

00:31:09.697 --> 00:31:11.280 align:middle line:84%
You're out in the
middle of the desert

00:31:11.280 --> 00:31:14.010 align:middle line:84%
and here's this tunnel that
just goes down into the Earth.

00:31:14.010 --> 00:31:17.770 align:middle line:10%
It used to be lined by
sphinxes on either side,

00:31:17.770 --> 00:31:22.680 align:middle line:10%
this grand palisade to
enter the sacred chambers.

00:31:22.680 --> 00:31:25.830 align:middle line:84%
But then, of course, the
French came and stole it.

00:31:25.830 --> 00:31:27.330 align:middle line:90%
They're like, we'll take those.

00:31:27.330 --> 00:31:30.930 align:middle line:84%
We're taking them to
the Louver with us.

00:31:30.930 --> 00:31:36.090 align:middle line:10%
And each of these chambers
inside the Serapeum

00:31:36.090 --> 00:31:41.324 align:middle line:10%
contained these massive
stone sarcophaguses.

00:31:41.324 --> 00:31:44.140 align:middle line:10%


00:31:44.140 --> 00:31:45.900 align:middle line:10%
Ha, and guess what.

00:31:45.900 --> 00:31:48.722 align:middle line:10%
It's not just a couple of them.

00:31:48.722 --> 00:31:54.430 align:middle line:84%
Each one of these weighs
70 to 100 metric tons.

00:31:54.430 --> 00:31:57.330 align:middle line:10%
They are diorite or granite.

00:31:57.330 --> 00:32:01.590 align:middle line:10%
They are complete with a
lid that's usually two feet.

00:32:01.590 --> 00:32:04.140 align:middle line:10%
In this case this one's
about three feet thick.

00:32:04.140 --> 00:32:08.520 align:middle line:10%
They have sealing
tracks, hollow interiors,

00:32:08.520 --> 00:32:15.530 align:middle line:10%
and they're single pieces
of stone, one stone.

00:32:15.530 --> 00:32:21.472 align:middle line:84%
Lid, body, everything else foot
and 1/2 feet thick, carved out.

00:32:21.472 --> 00:32:23.400 align:middle line:90%
Ha.

00:32:23.400 --> 00:32:26.470 align:middle line:10%
And the bottom portion--

00:32:26.470 --> 00:32:27.990 align:middle line:10%
you can see people
standing here--

00:32:27.990 --> 00:32:29.890 align:middle line:10%
this is like six,
seven feet tall.

00:32:29.890 --> 00:32:33.030 align:middle line:90%
This is about 16 feet long, OK.

00:32:33.030 --> 00:32:35.430 align:middle line:84%
And this one in particular
is really interesting

00:32:35.430 --> 00:32:37.890 align:middle line:84%
because it's got a bunch of
hieroglyphics carved on it.

00:32:37.890 --> 00:32:40.890 align:middle line:84%
Well, that must be the
guys that made it, right?

00:32:40.890 --> 00:32:42.420 align:middle line:84%
Except that the
hieroglyphics you

00:32:42.420 --> 00:32:45.900 align:middle line:84%
can tell they struggled
chipping it into the stone

00:32:45.900 --> 00:32:48.240 align:middle line:84%
because they couldn't even
get through the stone.

00:32:48.240 --> 00:32:50.100 align:middle line:90%
It's so hard.

00:32:50.100 --> 00:32:52.592 align:middle line:84%
In some places
they just stopped.

00:32:52.592 --> 00:32:54.300 align:middle line:84%
In some of the stones
they literally just

00:32:54.300 --> 00:32:55.800 align:middle line:90%
stopped writing the hieroglyphs.

00:32:55.800 --> 00:32:58.055 align:middle line:84%
They're like, OK, this
is too much, guys.

00:32:58.055 --> 00:32:59.430 align:middle line:84%
I'm just not even
going to do it.

00:32:59.430 --> 00:33:00.990 align:middle line:90%
And they're polished smooth.

00:33:00.990 --> 00:33:03.400 align:middle line:10%
You can put a laser
on one side of them

00:33:03.400 --> 00:33:07.200 align:middle line:10%
and it just, boom, beams
straight to the end

00:33:07.200 --> 00:33:10.610 align:middle line:10%
perfectly along the edge.

00:33:10.610 --> 00:33:16.170 align:middle line:10%
There's 24 chambers with these.

00:33:16.170 --> 00:33:20.670 align:middle line:10%
And there's another vault
they just opened up recently,

00:33:20.670 --> 00:33:24.480 align:middle line:10%
and there's over 40
containers in that one.

00:33:24.480 --> 00:33:27.450 align:middle line:10%
And the quarry where
the stone came from

00:33:27.450 --> 00:33:32.550 align:middle line:10%
is believed to have been
mined 50 miles away.

00:33:32.550 --> 00:33:37.780 align:middle line:10%
So how many freight
trains do you have?

00:33:37.780 --> 00:33:45.680 align:middle line:84%
And will the freight train
survive this stone on it?

00:33:45.680 --> 00:33:46.520 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:33:46.520 --> 00:33:50.570 align:middle line:10%
So I decided to start
measuring these things

00:33:50.570 --> 00:33:54.830 align:middle line:10%
and figure out if they have
a specific resonant tonality.

00:33:54.830 --> 00:33:57.570 align:middle line:90%
Well, guess what, they do.

00:33:57.570 --> 00:34:00.428 align:middle line:10%
And the resonant frequency
inside of the ones

00:34:00.428 --> 00:34:02.220 align:middle line:10%
that you can get into
at least, or the ones

00:34:02.220 --> 00:34:05.040 align:middle line:10%
I could get in and
measure, turns out

00:34:05.040 --> 00:34:08.520 align:middle line:10%
to be the same exact resonant
frequency as another very, very

00:34:08.520 --> 00:34:12.300 align:middle line:10%
important place in Egypt.

00:34:12.300 --> 00:34:13.310 align:middle line:90%
What's it going to be?

00:34:13.310 --> 00:34:18.060 align:middle line:90%


00:34:18.060 --> 00:34:21.960 align:middle line:10%
And you know what they
say about this spot?

00:34:21.960 --> 00:34:28.120 align:middle line:10%
They say it's a tomb
for bulls because when

00:34:28.120 --> 00:34:34.130 align:middle line:10%
I lose my favorite bull,
when I got to take him down,

00:34:34.130 --> 00:34:39.920 align:middle line:10%
what better way to honor
him than to travel 50 miles

00:34:39.920 --> 00:34:43.790 align:middle line:10%
and chisel out a 150-ton stone.

00:34:43.790 --> 00:34:51.159 align:middle line:10%
And then carry that stone for 50
miles on the backs of my freight

00:34:51.159 --> 00:34:52.690 align:middle line:10%
trains.

00:34:52.690 --> 00:34:56.770 align:middle line:84%
And then I will dig a
hole 150 feet underground,

00:34:56.770 --> 00:34:59.110 align:middle line:90%
bore through solid limestone.

00:34:59.110 --> 00:35:00.970 align:middle line:84%
And, you know what,
my friends have

00:35:00.970 --> 00:35:04.270 align:middle line:84%
cows so I'll just bore chamber
after chamber after chamber

00:35:04.270 --> 00:35:06.520 align:middle line:84%
after chamber after
chamber after chamber

00:35:06.520 --> 00:35:11.770 align:middle line:84%
so that once I put my bulls
sacred sarcophagus in,

00:35:11.770 --> 00:35:14.600 align:middle line:90%
all of my friends can too.

00:35:14.600 --> 00:35:16.220 align:middle line:84%
And you know why
they say this, they

00:35:16.220 --> 00:35:23.420 align:middle line:84%
say that they found some
bull bones in one of these.

00:35:23.420 --> 00:35:25.730 align:middle line:84%
That was already
open, by the way.

00:35:25.730 --> 00:35:28.340 align:middle line:84%
And I have friends
who actually went

00:35:28.340 --> 00:35:31.220 align:middle line:84%
to the Ministry of
Antiquities, and they

00:35:31.220 --> 00:35:34.100 align:middle line:84%
provided all of their
academic credentials

00:35:34.100 --> 00:35:36.530 align:middle line:84%
and their archeologist
background, all the stuff,

00:35:36.530 --> 00:35:41.198 align:middle line:84%
we would just love to see the
bones of that bull, please.

00:35:41.198 --> 00:35:44.440 align:middle line:90%
Oh, you don't have them?

00:35:44.440 --> 00:35:48.490 align:middle line:10%
You mean you didn't save the one
thing of evidence that tells us

00:35:48.490 --> 00:35:50.536 align:middle line:10%
what these are supposed to be?

00:35:50.536 --> 00:35:53.923 align:middle line:84%
Oh, I got it,
interesting, you just

00:35:53.923 --> 00:35:55.090 align:middle line:90%
threw it out with the trash.

00:35:55.090 --> 00:35:55.890 align:middle line:90%
I understand.

00:35:55.890 --> 00:35:58.270 align:middle line:90%
I mean, bull bones.

00:35:58.270 --> 00:36:01.420 align:middle line:84%
I would be offended because
literally I wouldn't

00:36:01.420 --> 00:36:04.730 align:middle line:90%
tomb my bulls this way.

00:36:04.730 --> 00:36:06.720 align:middle line:84%
You can see just how
amazing they are.

00:36:06.720 --> 00:36:08.720 align:middle line:84%
And you can see here
the hieroglyphics,

00:36:08.720 --> 00:36:12.600 align:middle line:84%
how they're just like barely
etched into this thing.

00:36:12.600 --> 00:36:16.190 align:middle line:10%
This was not created in
the Egyptian dynasties.

00:36:16.190 --> 00:36:19.070 align:middle line:10%
This was not created with
the level of technology

00:36:19.070 --> 00:36:23.000 align:middle line:10%
that we claim all of these
sites in Egypt were built under.

00:36:23.000 --> 00:36:25.680 align:middle line:84%
So what the heck
is going on here?

00:36:25.680 --> 00:36:29.910 align:middle line:84%
Why go through this gargantuan
effort of building this thing?

00:36:29.910 --> 00:36:32.820 align:middle line:84%
Well, I'm not going to leave
that one a mystery for you.

00:36:32.820 --> 00:36:39.870 align:middle line:84%
I think the whole thing is a
resonance-based battery system.

00:36:39.870 --> 00:36:42.390 align:middle line:90%
It stores electricity.

00:36:42.390 --> 00:36:45.810 align:middle line:10%
Because each of these chambers
vibrate at the same harmonic

00:36:45.810 --> 00:36:49.470 align:middle line:10%
frequencies, it's possible
that you could channel water

00:36:49.470 --> 00:36:52.800 align:middle line:10%
through a structure that would
move through certain release

00:36:52.800 --> 00:36:56.460 align:middle line:10%
points and create the
sounds that you get when you

00:36:56.460 --> 00:36:58.020 align:middle line:10%
hear things like a bullhorn.

00:36:58.020 --> 00:37:01.230 align:middle line:10%
You know that like,
[MOOING],, right?

00:37:01.230 --> 00:37:05.910 align:middle line:10%
Imagine this loud horn of
water pressure pushing air

00:37:05.910 --> 00:37:08.070 align:middle line:10%
through a chamber
thing, getting all

00:37:08.070 --> 00:37:12.460 align:middle line:10%
of these things vibrating at
the same time, at the same rate.

00:37:12.460 --> 00:37:18.480 align:middle line:10%
And if you added things like
gold molecules or things

00:37:18.480 --> 00:37:20.940 align:middle line:10%
like that to the
water, you could also

00:37:20.940 --> 00:37:25.350 align:middle line:10%
potentially produce a
piezoelectric resonant effect,

00:37:25.350 --> 00:37:28.260 align:middle line:10%
produce electricity,
and then transmit

00:37:28.260 --> 00:37:32.640 align:middle line:10%
that electricity across Egypt.

00:37:32.640 --> 00:37:37.830 align:middle line:10%
An entirely different
form of electrical system,

00:37:37.830 --> 00:37:41.220 align:middle line:10%
an entirely different form
of energy storage than what

00:37:41.220 --> 00:37:44.230 align:middle line:10%
we are used to here and now.

00:37:44.230 --> 00:37:46.930 align:middle line:10%
And I love to show
this video by this guy

00:37:46.930 --> 00:37:49.900 align:middle line:10%
Erik S. This is
triboluminescence,

00:37:49.900 --> 00:37:52.150 align:middle line:10%
just so that you understand
the physics of what

00:37:52.150 --> 00:37:53.320 align:middle line:10%
I'm talking about.

00:37:53.320 --> 00:37:59.410 align:middle line:10%
If you place sustained
pressure on granite like this

00:37:59.410 --> 00:38:02.020 align:middle line:10%
and other certain
kinds of stones,

00:38:02.020 --> 00:38:04.840 align:middle line:10%
that granite will illuminate.

00:38:04.840 --> 00:38:10.270 align:middle line:10%
It will release photons
and electromagnetic charge.

00:38:10.270 --> 00:38:12.550 align:middle line:10%
Did you know that when
you use your watch

00:38:12.550 --> 00:38:15.628 align:middle line:10%
or you use a lot of these
things, the liquid crystal

00:38:15.628 --> 00:38:17.170 align:middle line:10%
effect and all of
that kind of stuff,

00:38:17.170 --> 00:38:20.950 align:middle line:10%
this is basically a different
form of this same phenomenon.

00:38:20.950 --> 00:38:23.770 align:middle line:84%
Piezoelectricity,
you squeeze a crystal

00:38:23.770 --> 00:38:26.450 align:middle line:84%
just right and
electricity comes out.

00:38:26.450 --> 00:38:31.600 align:middle line:84%
So here's all these sites
built with massive stones that

00:38:31.600 --> 00:38:36.270 align:middle line:84%
have the potential to
do this kind of thing.

00:38:36.270 --> 00:38:40.990 align:middle line:10%
So maybe they're actually
part of a much larger network.

00:38:40.990 --> 00:38:42.900 align:middle line:84%
And so I was like,
well, that would

00:38:42.900 --> 00:38:46.710 align:middle line:84%
mean they'd have to be evidence
of the water that would flow

00:38:46.710 --> 00:38:49.220 align:middle line:84%
here that would then be
channeled to different positions

00:38:49.220 --> 00:38:50.220 align:middle line:90%
and different locations.

00:38:50.220 --> 00:38:52.680 align:middle line:84%
That would have to be
there to back up my theory.

00:38:52.680 --> 00:38:55.620 align:middle line:10%
Well, it turns out you go
straight towards the Great

00:38:55.620 --> 00:38:58.980 align:middle line:10%
Pyramids from this
spot in the Serapeum,

00:38:58.980 --> 00:39:02.940 align:middle line:10%
and you end up here at Abusir.

00:39:02.940 --> 00:39:07.080 align:middle line:10%
Abusir is like just
one of these like parts

00:39:07.080 --> 00:39:09.930 align:middle line:10%
along this line in this area.

00:39:09.930 --> 00:39:13.950 align:middle line:10%
And Abusir has all of these
structures that look like what?

00:39:13.950 --> 00:39:15.330 align:middle line:10%
Like baths.

00:39:15.330 --> 00:39:18.720 align:middle line:10%
Like they caught liquid
and held liquid in them.

00:39:18.720 --> 00:39:23.130 align:middle line:10%
And most of them are carved
with alabaster, beautiful.

00:39:23.130 --> 00:39:27.000 align:middle line:10%
And you've got this big
eight sided structure right

00:39:27.000 --> 00:39:28.080 align:middle line:10%
in the center.

00:39:28.080 --> 00:39:33.120 align:middle line:10%
And this big structure
essentially has a massive lid,

00:39:33.120 --> 00:39:38.670 align:middle line:10%
and the lid is over a tunnel
that goes deep down underground

00:39:38.670 --> 00:39:42.190 align:middle line:10%
and connects to a tunnel
network underground.

00:39:42.190 --> 00:39:44.330 align:middle line:84%
OK, a little more
evidence there.

00:39:44.330 --> 00:39:45.610 align:middle line:90%
We're doing good.

00:39:45.610 --> 00:39:51.820 align:middle line:84%
And these structures, the things
that this water would flow into

00:39:51.820 --> 00:39:57.970 align:middle line:84%
or would be channeled through
are all this fantastic crystal.

00:39:57.970 --> 00:40:05.200 align:middle line:10%
They're all made of crystal,
beautiful exquisite crystal.

00:40:05.200 --> 00:40:09.760 align:middle line:10%
And this site, of course,
leads you to Giza--

00:40:09.760 --> 00:40:11.920 align:middle line:10%
if you keep going
that same direction--

00:40:11.920 --> 00:40:13.960 align:middle line:10%
cuts straight across
the desert, you'd

00:40:13.960 --> 00:40:15.700 align:middle line:10%
make it to the Great Pyramids.

00:40:15.700 --> 00:40:20.980 align:middle line:84%
And I had to find, OK, well,
is there a site at Giza

00:40:20.980 --> 00:40:24.760 align:middle line:84%
that we can prove that
there's water down there

00:40:24.760 --> 00:40:26.932 align:middle line:84%
or that there was a
tunnel system underground?

00:40:26.932 --> 00:40:29.140 align:middle line:84%
Because, yeah, I've been in
the Great Pyramid, right.

00:40:29.140 --> 00:40:30.598 align:middle line:84%
You go in the Great
Pyramid, you go

00:40:30.598 --> 00:40:33.700 align:middle line:84%
down to the underground
subterranean chamber,

00:40:33.700 --> 00:40:36.970 align:middle line:84%
the deep root chakra
of the Vitruvian man--

00:40:36.970 --> 00:40:38.370 align:middle line:90%
as Robert would say.

00:40:38.370 --> 00:40:41.470 align:middle line:84%
And you're down there
and there's this thing

00:40:41.470 --> 00:40:42.790 align:middle line:90%
and it looks like a well.

00:40:42.790 --> 00:40:45.070 align:middle line:90%
But it's filled in.

00:40:45.070 --> 00:40:50.500 align:middle line:84%
The piping of the chambers,
it's not really meant for people

00:40:50.500 --> 00:40:51.770 align:middle line:90%
to walk through so much.

00:40:51.770 --> 00:40:55.120 align:middle line:84%
It's like you're like really on
your hands and knees in there.

00:40:55.120 --> 00:40:57.740 align:middle line:84%
Like, OK, I've got
to get down here.

00:40:57.740 --> 00:40:58.540 align:middle line:90%
It's intense.

00:40:58.540 --> 00:41:01.420 align:middle line:84%
It's hard to get
into and out of.

00:41:01.420 --> 00:41:04.660 align:middle line:10%
And it turns out,
though, that there

00:41:04.660 --> 00:41:09.410 align:middle line:10%
is a secret spot you're not
allowed into right there

00:41:09.410 --> 00:41:11.560 align:middle line:10%
on the Giza Plateau.

00:41:11.560 --> 00:41:15.190 align:middle line:84%
And it's called
the Osirian Shaft.

00:41:15.190 --> 00:41:19.630 align:middle line:10%
And thanks to my good buddy
Robert Edward Grant and a lot

00:41:19.630 --> 00:41:22.450 align:middle line:10%
of baksheesh, we got in.

00:41:22.450 --> 00:41:26.155 align:middle line:10%
You climb down the ladder,
you climb down this one,

00:41:26.155 --> 00:41:28.675 align:middle line:10%
you climb down this one,
you climb down this one,

00:41:28.675 --> 00:41:34.510 align:middle line:10%
you keep going down, and guess
what, there's water under there.

00:41:34.510 --> 00:41:39.370 align:middle line:10%
A giant pool of it in this
beautiful amazing chamber

00:41:39.370 --> 00:41:41.890 align:middle line:10%
that clearly and
obviously must have

00:41:41.890 --> 00:41:45.490 align:middle line:10%
had some routing or
connecting to other sites

00:41:45.490 --> 00:41:48.010 align:middle line:10%
through this whole zone.

00:41:48.010 --> 00:41:50.730 align:middle line:84%
Nobody talks about this,
nobody points it out,

00:41:50.730 --> 00:41:52.290 align:middle line:90%
nobody even references it.

00:41:52.290 --> 00:41:54.810 align:middle line:10%
And why is it that the
Ministry of Antiquities

00:41:54.810 --> 00:41:57.870 align:middle line:10%
doesn't want anyone to
go down there at all?

00:41:57.870 --> 00:42:01.270 align:middle line:90%
Unless you really pay.

00:42:01.270 --> 00:42:03.277 align:middle line:90%
Interesting, right?

00:42:03.277 --> 00:42:05.360 align:middle line:84%
I also found it fascinating
there was tons of wood

00:42:05.360 --> 00:42:07.100 align:middle line:90%
down there.

00:42:07.100 --> 00:42:11.180 align:middle line:10%
Now if you go to a whole
different area of Egypt,

00:42:11.180 --> 00:42:15.650 align:middle line:10%
underneath what appears to be
a completely eroded pyramid

00:42:15.650 --> 00:42:21.890 align:middle line:10%
in Faiyum, we discover a
perfectly acoustically tuned

00:42:21.890 --> 00:42:27.350 align:middle line:10%
rose granite room with
curved granite ceilings

00:42:27.350 --> 00:42:30.080 align:middle line:10%
and a sarcophagus inside.

00:42:30.080 --> 00:42:33.650 align:middle line:10%
And that sarcophagus when
you measure its frequency

00:42:33.650 --> 00:42:37.010 align:middle line:10%
from inside by testing
its resonant frequency

00:42:37.010 --> 00:42:40.610 align:middle line:10%
until you hit the
exact number, it also

00:42:40.610 --> 00:42:45.980 align:middle line:10%
has that exact same frequency as
the one I found in the Serapeum.

00:42:45.980 --> 00:42:49.380 align:middle line:84%
That also matches
somewhere else.

00:42:49.380 --> 00:42:50.910 align:middle line:90%
Can you guess where it is?

00:42:50.910 --> 00:42:57.420 align:middle line:90%


00:42:57.420 --> 00:43:01.590 align:middle line:10%
Yes, the answer, of
course, to this question

00:43:01.590 --> 00:43:07.800 align:middle line:10%
leads us back to the
big epic, broad center

00:43:07.800 --> 00:43:10.710 align:middle line:10%
of the ancient
mathematical world.

00:43:10.710 --> 00:43:14.790 align:middle line:10%
The Great Pyramid
of Giza is an object

00:43:14.790 --> 00:43:21.570 align:middle line:10%
that is so full of mathematical
precision, knowledge, structures

00:43:21.570 --> 00:43:27.000 align:middle line:10%
that empower potentially
new kinds of engineering,

00:43:27.000 --> 00:43:29.790 align:middle line:10%
new kinds of understanding
between the connections

00:43:29.790 --> 00:43:31.620 align:middle line:10%
of the mathematical constants.

00:43:31.620 --> 00:43:38.280 align:middle line:10%
The Great Pyramid of Giza is
truly a marvel in so many ways

00:43:38.280 --> 00:43:42.600 align:middle line:10%
that you could spend probably
your entire life studying

00:43:42.600 --> 00:43:45.690 align:middle line:10%
it to understand it
and you would probably

00:43:45.690 --> 00:43:48.050 align:middle line:10%
only scratch the surface.

00:43:48.050 --> 00:43:52.250 align:middle line:84%
And, yes, the
place that vibrates

00:43:52.250 --> 00:43:57.520 align:middle line:84%
at that exact same resonant
frequency, the King's Chamber.

00:43:57.520 --> 00:43:59.860 align:middle line:10%
The King's Chamber,
in fact, has two

00:43:59.860 --> 00:44:02.440 align:middle line:10%
interesting resonant
frequencies in it.

00:44:02.440 --> 00:44:04.990 align:middle line:10%
The lower one, the
one that you find

00:44:04.990 --> 00:44:08.500 align:middle line:10%
as the frequency in the Serapeum
and these other sarcophaguses

00:44:08.500 --> 00:44:10.510 align:middle line:10%
and these other
sites, other pyramids,

00:44:10.510 --> 00:44:17.720 align:middle line:10%
and places all across Egypt
all vibrate at 91.5 Hertz.

00:44:17.720 --> 00:44:23.510 align:middle line:84%
Interesting,
fascinating, 91.5 Hertz.

00:44:23.510 --> 00:44:26.660 align:middle line:84%
Well, it turns out after a
lot of work and a lot of study

00:44:26.660 --> 00:44:29.580 align:middle line:84%
in this space-- and I've
been in there many times--

00:44:29.580 --> 00:44:33.380 align:middle line:84%
I finally also found and
measured a higher frequency

00:44:33.380 --> 00:44:36.070 align:middle line:84%
inside the King's
Chamber as well.

00:44:36.070 --> 00:44:39.760 align:middle line:84%
And that higher frequency
harmonic that mostly you

00:44:39.760 --> 00:44:43.090 align:middle line:84%
can really only fully
feel and fully tune

00:44:43.090 --> 00:44:53.830 align:middle line:84%
when you're laying inside of
the Sarcophagus is 117.65 Hertz.

00:44:53.830 --> 00:44:55.240 align:middle line:90%
And I was like--

00:44:55.240 --> 00:45:01.690 align:middle line:84%
I came out of there I was like
Alan, Robert, it's 117.65, 765.

00:45:01.690 --> 00:45:03.000 align:middle line:90%
It's like a 6, 5, and a 7.

00:45:03.000 --> 00:45:03.970 align:middle line:90%
It's cool.

00:45:03.970 --> 00:45:06.040 align:middle line:84%
And you're like,
mmm, cool, all right.

00:45:06.040 --> 00:45:07.180 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, nice.

00:45:07.180 --> 00:45:09.640 align:middle line:84%
And I'm like, oh man, I got
to do better than that so

00:45:09.640 --> 00:45:11.080 align:middle line:90%
let me do some math here.

00:45:11.080 --> 00:45:14.830 align:middle line:90%
What's 91.5, 117.65.

00:45:14.830 --> 00:45:18.180 align:middle line:90%
And then I did that calculation.

00:45:18.180 --> 00:45:23.310 align:middle line:84%
Guess what the ratio is
between those two frequencies?

00:45:23.310 --> 00:45:28.862 align:middle line:90%
0.7777.

00:45:28.862 --> 00:45:31.070 align:middle line:84%
You can take out your
calculator and do it right now.

00:45:31.070 --> 00:45:39.490 align:middle line:90%
Ratio of 91.5 to 117.65, 0.7777.

00:45:39.490 --> 00:45:42.520 align:middle line:90%
I mean, weird, right?

00:45:42.520 --> 00:45:45.190 align:middle line:84%
I mean, those aren't even
notes that we know about.

00:45:45.190 --> 00:45:48.070 align:middle line:84%
Nobody even talks
about that ratio.

00:45:48.070 --> 00:45:53.620 align:middle line:84%
In music it's not like, oh yes,
no, play the ratio of the 0.7777

00:45:53.620 --> 00:45:54.970 align:middle line:90%
violin, right?

00:45:54.970 --> 00:45:58.780 align:middle line:84%
Like, it's not a
normal harmonic at all.

00:45:58.780 --> 00:46:03.340 align:middle line:84%
And yet we have all of these
ancient records and magic

00:46:03.340 --> 00:46:07.510 align:middle line:84%
and things that point to seven
as such a critical number

00:46:07.510 --> 00:46:11.470 align:middle line:84%
in our understanding of the
fabric of reality and ourselves.

00:46:11.470 --> 00:46:14.890 align:middle line:84%
Seven is this
beautiful expression,

00:46:14.890 --> 00:46:19.720 align:middle line:84%
sort of the first real prime
that when you divide it

00:46:19.720 --> 00:46:22.780 align:middle line:84%
into a circle, you can't
actually divide a circle

00:46:22.780 --> 00:46:24.010 align:middle line:90%
by seven evenly.

00:46:24.010 --> 00:46:27.610 align:middle line:84%
And it has these
endless tales going off

00:46:27.610 --> 00:46:29.650 align:middle line:90%
the numbers that go on forever.

00:46:29.650 --> 00:46:32.530 align:middle line:84%
And anything that has
divisibility by seven

00:46:32.530 --> 00:46:36.160 align:middle line:84%
or multiplication
by seven has all

00:46:36.160 --> 00:46:38.140 align:middle line:90%
of these fascinating properties.

00:46:38.140 --> 00:46:39.800 align:middle line:84%
And I won't get
into all of those

00:46:39.800 --> 00:46:42.110 align:middle line:84%
because this is not
actually a math talk--

00:46:42.110 --> 00:46:45.260 align:middle line:84%
and I do do some of those,
math and physics talks--

00:46:45.260 --> 00:46:51.080 align:middle line:84%
but to understand that they had
some reason here, some deeper

00:46:51.080 --> 00:46:54.350 align:middle line:84%
understanding they were
attempting to impart simply

00:46:54.350 --> 00:46:59.420 align:middle line:84%
by setting up the two higher and
lower resonant harmonic ratios

00:46:59.420 --> 00:47:00.920 align:middle line:90%
inside the King's Chamber.

00:47:00.920 --> 00:47:05.420 align:middle line:84%
And it also tells us, based on
that precision, that there's not

00:47:05.420 --> 00:47:08.540 align:middle line:84%
much mistake right now in the
resonance in the King's Chamber.

00:47:08.540 --> 00:47:12.560 align:middle line:84%
Sure it's had a few damages,
it's been blasted in a corner,

00:47:12.560 --> 00:47:15.410 align:middle line:84%
the Sarcophagus thing has
been moved, a piece of that

00:47:15.410 --> 00:47:19.970 align:middle line:84%
is missing, but even with
that, this chamber still

00:47:19.970 --> 00:47:21.470 align:middle line:90%
holds its tune.

00:47:21.470 --> 00:47:24.260 align:middle line:90%
It holds its note.

00:47:24.260 --> 00:47:26.750 align:middle line:90%
Now, I also discovered--

00:47:26.750 --> 00:47:28.160 align:middle line:90%
through the Great Pyramid--

00:47:28.160 --> 00:47:33.350 align:middle line:84%
that there are these other sites
all over inside the pyramid.

00:47:33.350 --> 00:47:37.340 align:middle line:84%
This is inside the Grand
Gallery, and each of these spots

00:47:37.340 --> 00:47:41.210 align:middle line:84%
is a resonant toning
machine, just like in Peru.

00:47:41.210 --> 00:47:42.140 align:middle line:10%
Hear that?

00:47:42.140 --> 00:47:53.330 align:middle line:90%


00:47:53.330 --> 00:47:55.520 align:middle line:10%
That's not even
the Kings chamber.

00:47:55.520 --> 00:47:57.500 align:middle line:10%
That's in the Grand Gallery.

00:47:57.500 --> 00:47:59.090 align:middle line:10%
And that's my buddy Mason.

00:47:59.090 --> 00:48:00.260 align:middle line:10%
He's an amazing singer.

00:48:00.260 --> 00:48:04.010 align:middle line:10%
But we get-- you get those
things ringing, suddenly

00:48:04.010 --> 00:48:06.410 align:middle line:10%
the Grand Gallery's
energy lights up,

00:48:06.410 --> 00:48:08.600 align:middle line:10%
the whole thing
starts resonating.

00:48:08.600 --> 00:48:12.270 align:middle line:10%
The Queen's Chamber has
its own resonant frequency,

00:48:12.270 --> 00:48:14.720 align:middle line:10%
so does the spot
down underground

00:48:14.720 --> 00:48:17.740 align:middle line:10%
in the underground chamber.

00:48:17.740 --> 00:48:20.170 align:middle line:84%
Each portion of
this structure is

00:48:20.170 --> 00:48:22.960 align:middle line:84%
designed to match
specific harmonics,

00:48:22.960 --> 00:48:25.160 align:middle line:90%
specific resonant frequencies.

00:48:25.160 --> 00:48:27.010 align:middle line:84%
And if you go
through them and you

00:48:27.010 --> 00:48:31.380 align:middle line:84%
activate them and you experience
them, boy, I can tell you,

00:48:31.380 --> 00:48:33.150 align:middle line:90%
you get some downloads.

00:48:33.150 --> 00:48:37.080 align:middle line:84%
Now it is also very hard
to get enough people

00:48:37.080 --> 00:48:40.500 align:middle line:84%
to get one of these things
vibrating in its totality.

00:48:40.500 --> 00:48:45.840 align:middle line:84%
But I'll tell you that the night
that Nassim Haramein and I led

00:48:45.840 --> 00:48:50.370 align:middle line:84%
a student expedition across
Egypt, we had all three pyramids

00:48:50.370 --> 00:48:51.810 align:middle line:90%
reserved overnight.

00:48:51.810 --> 00:48:54.310 align:middle line:84%
We had a group of
about 200 of us.

00:48:54.310 --> 00:48:57.690 align:middle line:84%
And so what we did is we split
into four different groups

00:48:57.690 --> 00:49:03.860 align:middle line:84%
and we went in to activate all
three pyramids at the same time.

00:49:03.860 --> 00:49:06.610 align:middle line:84%
So what we did is we had
the first group go in,

00:49:06.610 --> 00:49:08.920 align:middle line:90%
activate the Great Pyramid.

00:49:08.920 --> 00:49:10.940 align:middle line:84%
That group went
into the second--

00:49:10.940 --> 00:49:13.510 align:middle line:90%
second pyramid, first group--

00:49:13.510 --> 00:49:15.370 align:middle line:84%
next group went into
the first pyramid,

00:49:15.370 --> 00:49:19.170 align:middle line:84%
and then first group goes
into the third pyramid,

00:49:19.170 --> 00:49:20.940 align:middle line:84%
now there's one in
the second pyramid,

00:49:20.940 --> 00:49:25.050 align:middle line:84%
and I had the deep amazing
honor of being the third group

00:49:25.050 --> 00:49:27.450 align:middle line:84%
to enter the Great
Pyramid with all three

00:49:27.450 --> 00:49:29.130 align:middle line:84%
of them humming
at the same time.

00:49:29.130 --> 00:49:32.170 align:middle line:84%
And I went through and I
just did it with my students.

00:49:32.170 --> 00:49:34.260 align:middle line:84%
We went through, we
unlocked the sequence,

00:49:34.260 --> 00:49:39.150 align:middle line:84%
we got the whole thing
going, and you could feel it.

00:49:39.150 --> 00:49:41.220 align:middle line:90%
But not just feel it.

00:49:41.220 --> 00:49:44.740 align:middle line:84%
We had a doctor who
was in a wheelchair.

00:49:44.740 --> 00:49:46.560 align:middle line:90%
She's not a metaphysics person.

00:49:46.560 --> 00:49:50.190 align:middle line:84%
She would just scoff at
probably this entire conference,

00:49:50.190 --> 00:49:51.870 align:middle line:90%
or a lot of it.

00:49:51.870 --> 00:49:54.810 align:middle line:84%
And she was really
interested, though,

00:49:54.810 --> 00:49:57.480 align:middle line:84%
in the physics and the
mathematics of this stuff.

00:49:57.480 --> 00:50:01.110 align:middle line:84%
She's sitting outside at
night in her wheelchair,

00:50:01.110 --> 00:50:04.500 align:middle line:84%
and she said when we came
out of that Great Pyramid,

00:50:04.500 --> 00:50:08.220 align:middle line:84%
she looks at me she says,
I saw them light up.

00:50:08.220 --> 00:50:11.340 align:middle line:84%
There was light coming out
of the top of those things.

00:50:11.340 --> 00:50:12.300 align:middle line:90%
I don't even--

00:50:12.300 --> 00:50:16.910 align:middle line:84%
I don't know how you guys
did that but there was light.

00:50:16.910 --> 00:50:20.260 align:middle line:84%
And I realized at that
moment this was not just like

00:50:20.260 --> 00:50:22.960 align:middle line:90%
a grand magical experiment.

00:50:22.960 --> 00:50:28.120 align:middle line:84%
This was part of a reactivation,
a tuning process, an opening

00:50:28.120 --> 00:50:33.660 align:middle line:84%
and unlocking process in order
to access the deeper knowledge

00:50:33.660 --> 00:50:36.180 align:middle line:90%
and resonance in these stones.
