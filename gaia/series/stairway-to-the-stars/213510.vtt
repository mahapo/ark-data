00:00:08.712 --> 00:00:11.620 align:middle line:90%


00:00:11.620 --> 00:00:13.930 align:middle line:90%
>> I'm Danny Sheehan.

00:00:13.930 --> 00:00:16.960 align:middle line:10%
Some of you may know who
I am, or else you probably

00:00:16.960 --> 00:00:19.030 align:middle line:10%
wouldn't be here.

00:00:19.030 --> 00:00:25.360 align:middle line:84%
But that I've come here today
to talk with you about something

00:00:25.360 --> 00:00:31.210 align:middle line:84%
that peculiarly enough, very
few people know is happening.

00:00:31.210 --> 00:00:40.630 align:middle line:84%
That we know that since actually
around July 6th of 1945,

00:00:40.630 --> 00:00:47.260 align:middle line:84%
with the detonation of the first
atomic bomb here among our human

00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:50.110 align:middle line:84%
family at Alamogordo
in New Mexico,

00:00:50.110 --> 00:00:52.750 align:middle line:84%
at the White Sands
Proving Ground,

00:00:52.750 --> 00:01:00.490 align:middle line:84%
our United States government
has been seeing craft come

00:01:00.490 --> 00:01:05.800 align:middle line:84%
in and out, coming in from
over 80,000 feet descending

00:01:05.800 --> 00:01:09.440 align:middle line:84%
to the surface of the Earth
within like 0.7 tenths of one

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:10.850 align:middle line:90%
second.

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:15.650 align:middle line:84%
Traveling at over 20,000 miles
an hour in the atmosphere with

00:01:15.650 --> 00:01:17.030 align:middle line:90%
no friction.

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:21.050 align:middle line:84%
Changing speeds at
a 90 degree angle.

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:23.810 align:middle line:84%
Going tens of thousands
of miles an hour,

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:29.510 align:middle line:84%
which would actually generate
something like 600 Gs of force

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:32.780 align:middle line:90%
on anybody inside the vehicle.

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:39.320 align:middle line:84%
And I say this started
right around July of 1945

00:01:39.320 --> 00:01:43.790 align:middle line:84%
when we were preparing to
detonate the first atomic bomb.

00:01:43.790 --> 00:01:46.100 align:middle line:84%
Now the reason
that we know this,

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:51.140 align:middle line:84%
the reason I know this isn't
just from reading about it

00:01:51.140 --> 00:01:53.180 align:middle line:90%
and people telling about it.

00:01:53.180 --> 00:02:00.590 align:middle line:84%
I happen to have been shown a
little 8mm black and white home

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:05.690 align:middle line:84%
movie that was produced,
if you can call it that,

00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:07.880 align:middle line:90%
by Colonel Philip Corso.

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:12.650 align:middle line:84%
Philip Corso was a security
officer at the White Sands

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:17.780 align:middle line:84%
Proving Grounds on
July 16th of 1945.

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:26.050 align:middle line:84%
And he left this little homemade
8mm movie for his grandchildren.

00:02:26.050 --> 00:02:30.670 align:middle line:84%
That was not to be shown
until after he died.

00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:34.600 align:middle line:84%
And I saw this, I was
actually shown this

00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:40.070 align:middle line:84%
by George Knapp who
most of you know.

00:02:40.070 --> 00:02:44.690 align:middle line:84%
I was at the International
UFO Congress out in Laughlin

00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:48.080 align:middle line:84%
when it was back in
Laughlin during the time

00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:53.750 align:middle line:84%
when I was representing Dr.
John Mack, who many of you know.

00:02:53.750 --> 00:02:58.160 align:middle line:84%
And I was there and
George had a copy of this

00:02:58.160 --> 00:03:00.360 align:middle line:90%
and showed it to me.

00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:05.720 align:middle line:84%
And in this little
8mm home movie,

00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:11.540 align:middle line:84%
Colonel Corso left a very
sincere and completely personal

00:03:11.540 --> 00:03:17.390 align:middle line:84%
message for his grandchildren,
telling them that he had been

00:03:17.390 --> 00:03:21.500 align:middle line:84%
a security officer for
the United States military

00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:26.600 align:middle line:84%
at Alamogordo on
July 16th, 1945.

00:03:26.600 --> 00:03:30.890 align:middle line:84%
And he was one of the
officers in charge

00:03:30.890 --> 00:03:36.320 align:middle line:84%
of maintaining security around
this facility, which was engaged

00:03:36.320 --> 00:03:41.610 align:middle line:84%
in the number one top most
secret program probably

00:03:41.610 --> 00:03:44.250 align:middle line:84%
in the history of the United
States up until that time.

00:03:44.250 --> 00:03:48.480 align:middle line:84%
This was the culmination
of the Manhattan Project

00:03:48.480 --> 00:03:50.670 align:middle line:84%
that had been underway
for so many years.

00:03:50.670 --> 00:03:54.390 align:middle line:84%
And was the subject of
such extraordinary security

00:03:54.390 --> 00:03:55.450 align:middle line:90%
precautions.

00:03:55.450 --> 00:03:59.960 align:middle line:90%
And he took a break for lunch.

00:03:59.960 --> 00:04:01.350 align:middle line:90%
He said to his grandchildren.

00:04:01.350 --> 00:04:04.250 align:middle line:84%
And he got in one of
the little Jeeps there

00:04:04.250 --> 00:04:06.890 align:middle line:84%
and he drove off to
some little hills

00:04:06.890 --> 00:04:10.400 align:middle line:84%
there by Alamogordo
to have his sandwiches

00:04:10.400 --> 00:04:11.780 align:middle line:90%
lunch that he had for lunch.

00:04:11.780 --> 00:04:16.250 align:middle line:84%
And he actually
encountered an actual UFO

00:04:16.250 --> 00:04:19.220 align:middle line:90%
that was on the ground.

00:04:19.220 --> 00:04:22.880 align:middle line:84%
And he was completely
thunderstruck by this.

00:04:22.880 --> 00:04:26.160 align:middle line:84%
And he approached
the UFO vehicle.

00:04:26.160 --> 00:04:33.630 align:middle line:84%
And the being from in the
vehicle was outside the vehicle.

00:04:33.630 --> 00:04:37.130 align:middle line:84%
And he said telepathically
communicated to him

00:04:37.130 --> 00:04:43.940 align:middle line:84%
the fact that his vehicle
had been disabled somehow

00:04:43.940 --> 00:04:47.180 align:middle line:84%
by what he thought
was like radar

00:04:47.180 --> 00:04:49.580 align:middle line:84%
around the facility,
security radar.

00:04:49.580 --> 00:04:53.690 align:middle line:84%
And the being
implored him to please

00:04:53.690 --> 00:04:57.770 align:middle line:84%
if he could go back and
get them to shut off

00:04:57.770 --> 00:05:03.660 align:middle line:84%
the radar for just a couple of
minutes so that they could flee.

00:05:03.660 --> 00:05:08.490 align:middle line:84%
And he actually made the
decision to do that, he said.

00:05:08.490 --> 00:05:13.920 align:middle line:84%
Now he was admitting this to his
grandchildren in the little 8mm

00:05:13.920 --> 00:05:17.610 align:middle line:84%
movie because he assumed he was
going to be dead by that time.

00:05:17.610 --> 00:05:20.820 align:middle line:84%
So he could acknowledge
that he actually

00:05:20.820 --> 00:05:26.080 align:middle line:84%
probably violated his
security oath to allow this.

00:05:26.080 --> 00:05:29.590 align:middle line:84%
But he felt morally
compelled to do this.

00:05:29.590 --> 00:05:36.210 align:middle line:84%
And so that my judgment about
the veracity of the assertion

00:05:36.210 --> 00:05:40.020 align:middle line:84%
that there were UFO
vehicles coming around

00:05:40.020 --> 00:05:43.740 align:middle line:84%
the facility at White Sands
when we were detonating

00:05:43.740 --> 00:05:48.900 align:middle line:84%
the first atomic bomb is
more than just simple word

00:05:48.900 --> 00:05:50.610 align:middle line:90%
of mouth from somewhere.

00:05:50.610 --> 00:05:54.660 align:middle line:84%
This was extraordinarily
convincing evidence

00:05:54.660 --> 00:05:56.520 align:middle line:90%
of the truth of that.

00:05:56.520 --> 00:06:00.630 align:middle line:84%
That's the number one fact that
I want to start with tonight,

00:06:00.630 --> 00:06:05.200 align:middle line:84%
is that our United States
government officials

00:06:05.200 --> 00:06:10.360 align:middle line:84%
have known that these UFOs
were hovering and coming

00:06:10.360 --> 00:06:14.500 align:middle line:84%
around the nuclear test
facilities of the United States

00:06:14.500 --> 00:06:18.220 align:middle line:90%
as early as July of 1945.

00:06:18.220 --> 00:06:24.460 align:middle line:84%
We also know, of course,
that as of July of 1947,

00:06:24.460 --> 00:06:30.820 align:middle line:84%
the United States government has
been in possession of the crash

00:06:30.820 --> 00:06:37.540 align:middle line:84%
debris from a crashed UFO
and that they actually

00:06:37.540 --> 00:06:42.650 align:middle line:84%
recovered physical remains
of some of the bodies there.

00:06:42.650 --> 00:06:46.100 align:middle line:84%
Now we've all heard
myriad stories about this.

00:06:46.100 --> 00:06:48.160 align:middle line:84%
We've heard various
accounts of it.

00:06:48.160 --> 00:06:54.410 align:middle line:84%
The reason that I credit
it to particular reasons,

00:06:54.410 --> 00:06:57.760 align:middle line:84%
especially is one
is because I happen

00:06:57.760 --> 00:06:59.440 align:middle line:84%
to be one of the
people some of you

00:06:59.440 --> 00:07:04.810 align:middle line:84%
may have to talk directly
to Jesse Marcel Jr who

00:07:04.810 --> 00:07:09.010 align:middle line:84%
was physically shown
some of the debris.

00:07:09.010 --> 00:07:11.330 align:middle line:90%
And I spoke with him.

00:07:11.330 --> 00:07:15.340 align:middle line:84%
I found him to be extremely
credible in the first person.

00:07:15.340 --> 00:07:21.310 align:middle line:84%
But a second important
thing is, is that when--

00:07:21.310 --> 00:07:23.830 align:middle line:84%
as many of you probably
know, as I mentioned,

00:07:23.830 --> 00:07:28.750 align:middle line:84%
I represented Dr. John Mack
at Harvard University in 1994

00:07:28.750 --> 00:07:33.310 align:middle line:84%
when he was dragged up in
front of a faculty committee.

00:07:33.310 --> 00:07:37.600 align:middle line:84%
And they were attempting to
potentially terminate his tenure

00:07:37.600 --> 00:07:40.750 align:middle line:84%
at Harvard because he had
written a book, published

00:07:40.750 --> 00:07:45.890 align:middle line:84%
a book called Abduction:
Human Contact with Aliens.

00:07:45.890 --> 00:07:51.610 align:middle line:84%
And the Dean of the medical
school convened a special panel

00:07:51.610 --> 00:07:55.210 align:middle line:84%
and brought him in front of the
panel to basically threaten him,

00:07:55.210 --> 00:08:00.100 align:middle line:84%
to get him to stop going on
Oprah Winfrey and other places,

00:08:00.100 --> 00:08:03.460 align:middle line:84%
talking about the fact that he'd
interviewed so many people that

00:08:03.460 --> 00:08:07.360 align:middle line:84%
had had direct contact
with UFO beings.

00:08:07.360 --> 00:08:12.940 align:middle line:84%
And I was at the International
UFO Congress in 1994,

00:08:12.940 --> 00:08:16.450 align:middle line:84%
and I was giving
people an update

00:08:16.450 --> 00:08:20.390 align:middle line:84%
on how we were doing on that
particular confrontation

00:08:20.390 --> 00:08:22.280 align:middle line:90%
with Harvard.

00:08:22.280 --> 00:08:26.050 align:middle line:90%
And so I had given my talk.

00:08:26.050 --> 00:08:29.690 align:middle line:84%
And a young fellow came up out
of the audience and he said,

00:08:29.690 --> 00:08:32.600 align:middle line:84%
Mr. Sheehan, he said, I've
got something really important

00:08:32.600 --> 00:08:33.780 align:middle line:90%
to talk with you about.

00:08:33.780 --> 00:08:37.100 align:middle line:84%
Could you come up and meet me
at my room here in the hotel.

00:08:37.100 --> 00:08:40.820 align:middle line:84%
And I went, well, look, I'm
going to get a friend of mine

00:08:40.820 --> 00:08:42.380 align:middle line:90%
to come with us.

00:08:42.380 --> 00:08:43.880 align:middle line:84%
And I went and got
a friend of mine.

00:08:43.880 --> 00:08:44.840 align:middle line:90%
We went upstairs.

00:08:44.840 --> 00:08:46.490 align:middle line:84%
And what he said
is he said, look,

00:08:46.490 --> 00:08:53.180 align:middle line:84%
I think that I have found the
photographer who actually was

00:08:53.180 --> 00:09:00.020 align:middle line:84%
called at 2 o'clock in the
morning on July 9th of 1947

00:09:00.020 --> 00:09:04.880 align:middle line:84%
by his editor of the local
newspaper in Roswell.

00:09:04.880 --> 00:09:08.960 align:middle line:84%
And said that he'd been
contacted by general Ramey who

00:09:08.960 --> 00:09:12.230 align:middle line:84%
was the commanding general of
the region of the US Army Air

00:09:12.230 --> 00:09:19.850 align:middle line:84%
Force, and told to send a
photographer out to the 509th

00:09:19.850 --> 00:09:24.830 align:middle line:84%
bomber group, US
Army Air Force base,

00:09:24.830 --> 00:09:30.200 align:middle line:84%
where the UFO report had come
out earlier the previous day,

00:09:30.200 --> 00:09:35.660 align:middle line:84%
where Jesse Marcel, the public
relations director at the base

00:09:35.660 --> 00:09:39.650 align:middle line:84%
had issued a public statement
that they'd recovered a UFO,

00:09:39.650 --> 00:09:40.760 align:middle line:90%
as you know.

00:09:40.760 --> 00:09:45.110 align:middle line:84%
And it had gone out on the AP
wires all across the world,

00:09:45.110 --> 00:09:48.290 align:middle line:84%
and it was on the headlines
of every newspaper

00:09:48.290 --> 00:09:49.670 align:middle line:90%
around the world.

00:09:49.670 --> 00:09:53.660 align:middle line:84%
And so general Ramey had
made this desperate call

00:09:53.660 --> 00:09:57.590 align:middle line:84%
to the editor of the newspaper
to send a photographer over

00:09:57.590 --> 00:10:00.920 align:middle line:84%
in the middle of the night,
2 o'clock in the morning.

00:10:00.920 --> 00:10:04.730 align:middle line:84%
And that person
came and was ordered

00:10:04.730 --> 00:10:08.660 align:middle line:84%
to take a set of
photographs of general Ramey

00:10:08.660 --> 00:10:14.420 align:middle line:84%
kneeling down on the
floor with debris

00:10:14.420 --> 00:10:17.520 align:middle line:84%
from a weather
balloon on the floor.

00:10:17.520 --> 00:10:19.580 align:middle line:84%
This is a big famous
set of photos.

00:10:19.580 --> 00:10:22.790 align:middle line:84%
Many of you have
probably seen these.

00:10:22.790 --> 00:10:25.820 align:middle line:84%
And this young
fellow in 1994 said

00:10:25.820 --> 00:10:29.870 align:middle line:84%
he thinks he found the
photographer from the Roswell

00:10:29.870 --> 00:10:33.030 align:middle line:84%
newspaper that was asked
to come and do this.

00:10:33.030 --> 00:10:34.410 align:middle line:90%
And I said, wow.

00:10:34.410 --> 00:10:35.720 align:middle line:90%
I said wow, this is amazing.

00:10:35.720 --> 00:10:37.730 align:middle line:84%
Look, if you can find
that guy, if it turns out

00:10:37.730 --> 00:10:39.980 align:middle line:84%
to be the right guy,
what you should do

00:10:39.980 --> 00:10:41.900 align:middle line:84%
is find out if
he, by any chance,

00:10:41.900 --> 00:10:45.248 align:middle line:84%
has kept the negatives
of these photographs,

00:10:45.248 --> 00:10:46.790 align:middle line:84%
because he must have
realized that it

00:10:46.790 --> 00:10:49.970 align:middle line:84%
was kind of an historic
event and see if he--

00:10:49.970 --> 00:10:52.310 align:middle line:84%
because if, in fact,
he's got the negatives,

00:10:52.310 --> 00:10:55.010 align:middle line:84%
we can potentially
digitize these.

00:10:55.010 --> 00:11:00.380 align:middle line:84%
Because I have for years seen
that Roger Ramey, general Ramey

00:11:00.380 --> 00:11:03.560 align:middle line:84%
when he was kneeling down
next to this weather balloon,

00:11:03.560 --> 00:11:07.220 align:middle line:84%
had this table in his
hand, like a telegraph

00:11:07.220 --> 00:11:09.210 align:middle line:90%
he had in his hand, a table.

00:11:09.210 --> 00:11:12.170 align:middle line:84%
And I was always saying
to myself someday,

00:11:12.170 --> 00:11:14.750 align:middle line:84%
we may have the
technology by means

00:11:14.750 --> 00:11:17.840 align:middle line:90%
of which we can read that memo.

00:11:17.840 --> 00:11:21.770 align:middle line:84%
And so I said to this guy,
look, see if it's the right guy.

00:11:21.770 --> 00:11:23.120 align:middle line:90%
So he goes back and finds out.

00:11:23.120 --> 00:11:24.790 align:middle line:84%
And sure enough, it
was the right guy.

00:11:24.790 --> 00:11:26.340 align:middle line:90%
It was the photographer.

00:11:26.340 --> 00:11:28.640 align:middle line:84%
He did, in fact,
have the negatives.

00:11:28.640 --> 00:11:30.500 align:middle line:84%
What we did is we put
some funds together

00:11:30.500 --> 00:11:33.470 align:middle line:84%
from some contributors--
a contributor,

00:11:33.470 --> 00:11:37.700 align:middle line:84%
actually, and got them
digitized the negatives.

00:11:37.700 --> 00:11:38.670 align:middle line:90%
And they blew them up.

00:11:38.670 --> 00:11:41.240 align:middle line:84%
And then we ran
through computer,

00:11:41.240 --> 00:11:43.160 align:middle line:84%
an analysis of the
letters that could

00:11:43.160 --> 00:11:46.700 align:middle line:84%
be seen using certain
computer technology of how

00:11:46.700 --> 00:11:48.770 align:middle line:84%
many consonants and
vowels there were,

00:11:48.770 --> 00:11:51.500 align:middle line:84%
et cetera, so that certain
of the words could be read

00:11:51.500 --> 00:11:54.600 align:middle line:84%
and others that were in the
folds could be projected.

00:11:54.600 --> 00:11:59.940 align:middle line:84%
And it said in there bring
the disk to right field.

00:11:59.940 --> 00:12:04.020 align:middle line:90%
And bring the occupants.

00:12:04.020 --> 00:12:05.370 align:middle line:90%
That's what it said.

00:12:05.370 --> 00:12:08.730 align:middle line:84%
And so that's no
weather balloon.

00:12:08.730 --> 00:12:16.590 align:middle line:84%
And so because of how I was
able to participate personally

00:12:16.590 --> 00:12:22.830 align:middle line:84%
in getting that cable digitized
and blown up and translated,

00:12:22.830 --> 00:12:26.670 align:middle line:84%
we know that general
Ramey in the cable

00:12:26.670 --> 00:12:32.310 align:middle line:84%
revealed unbeknownst to himself
the fact that it was a disk.

00:12:32.310 --> 00:12:34.920 align:middle line:84%
And that they sent
it to right field,

00:12:34.920 --> 00:12:37.380 align:middle line:84%
which later became Wright
Patterson in the 10th

00:12:37.380 --> 00:12:39.720 align:middle line:90%
congressional district in Ohio.

00:12:39.720 --> 00:12:46.830 align:middle line:84%
And so that I know in a way
that's a little bit more

00:12:46.830 --> 00:12:50.910 align:middle line:84%
than the average
person that is real,

00:12:50.910 --> 00:12:53.760 align:middle line:84%
that we actually
recovered the disk

00:12:53.760 --> 00:12:56.760 align:middle line:90%
and we recovered the bodies.

00:12:56.760 --> 00:13:00.300 align:middle line:84%
And that the United
States government

00:13:00.300 --> 00:13:06.100 align:middle line:84%
has been lying to us
basically ever since then.

00:13:06.100 --> 00:13:14.500 align:middle line:84%
And we know that 76 years
later, Colonel David Grusch

00:13:14.500 --> 00:13:18.640 align:middle line:84%
testified live to the
United States Congress,

00:13:18.640 --> 00:13:21.820 align:middle line:84%
to the House Oversight
Committee, the Subcommittee

00:13:21.820 --> 00:13:23.530 align:middle line:90%
on national security.

00:13:23.530 --> 00:13:25.050 align:middle line:90%
I was there.

00:13:25.050 --> 00:13:26.750 align:middle line:90%
I knew Colonel Grusch.

00:13:26.750 --> 00:13:29.530 align:middle line:84%
I talked to him a number
of times before that.

00:13:29.530 --> 00:13:31.850 align:middle line:84%
I talked with him
before he testified.

00:13:31.850 --> 00:13:33.820 align:middle line:84%
I talked to him immediately
after he testified.

00:13:33.820 --> 00:13:36.670 align:middle line:84%
I was sitting in the
front row, as you are,

00:13:36.670 --> 00:13:40.720 align:middle line:90%
when he testified about that.

00:13:40.720 --> 00:13:46.810 align:middle line:84%
And he, as you know, became the
first of the high ranking US

00:13:46.810 --> 00:13:52.210 align:middle line:84%
military officials to actually
under oath, in public,

00:13:52.210 --> 00:13:55.150 align:middle line:84%
testify to the United
States congress.

00:13:55.150 --> 00:13:58.660 align:middle line:84%
In which he asserted
that in his capacity

00:13:58.660 --> 00:14:01.660 align:middle line:84%
as the liaison from the
National Reconnaissance

00:14:01.660 --> 00:14:05.900 align:middle line:84%
Office to the Office
of Naval Intelligence--

00:14:05.900 --> 00:14:13.390 align:middle line:84%
UFO or UAP Task Force, actually
had interviewed almost 40 people

00:14:13.390 --> 00:14:19.870 align:middle line:84%
that were directly involved
in the program recovering

00:14:19.870 --> 00:14:24.220 align:middle line:84%
these crashed UFOs and engaged
in this long-term project

00:14:24.220 --> 00:14:28.150 align:middle line:84%
to try to reverse engineer
the technology that had

00:14:28.150 --> 00:14:30.680 align:middle line:90%
been recovered in these UFOs.

00:14:30.680 --> 00:14:34.300 align:middle line:84%
And he asserted under
oath again that we

00:14:34.300 --> 00:14:39.580 align:middle line:84%
had recovered what he called
biologics or biological evidence

00:14:39.580 --> 00:14:46.540 align:middle line:84%
of the non-human intelligence
of the occupants, the pilots

00:14:46.540 --> 00:14:49.480 align:middle line:84%
of a number of
these UFO vehicles.

00:14:49.480 --> 00:14:57.902 align:middle line:84%
Now this was the most
extraordinary testimony that--

00:14:57.902 --> 00:14:59.860 align:middle line:84%
now there have been others
who have said things

00:14:59.860 --> 00:15:04.470 align:middle line:84%
like this, that Edgar Mitchell
has talked about information

00:15:04.470 --> 00:15:05.270 align:middle line:90%
like this.

00:15:05.270 --> 00:15:06.812 align:middle line:84%
We've had other
people talk about it.

00:15:06.812 --> 00:15:09.610 align:middle line:84%
But this is the first time
that a high ranking US

00:15:09.610 --> 00:15:12.400 align:middle line:84%
military official
under oath in front

00:15:12.400 --> 00:15:17.140 align:middle line:84%
of an officially convened
public meeting of congress,

00:15:17.140 --> 00:15:21.770 align:middle line:84%
testified under oath,
asserting that to be true.

00:15:21.770 --> 00:15:25.420 align:middle line:90%
Now, it's important to--

00:15:25.420 --> 00:15:27.520 align:middle line:84%
another important thing
to remember about this,

00:15:27.520 --> 00:15:31.330 align:middle line:84%
and this is a little known fact
about this comparatively well

00:15:31.330 --> 00:15:33.010 align:middle line:84%
known event now
that's taking place

00:15:33.010 --> 00:15:38.360 align:middle line:84%
is that his testimony
was officially cleared

00:15:38.360 --> 00:15:42.740 align:middle line:84%
by the national security
agencies of our United States

00:15:42.740 --> 00:15:48.470 align:middle line:84%
government for him to
present that public testimony

00:15:48.470 --> 00:15:50.360 align:middle line:90%
to Congress.

00:15:50.360 --> 00:15:54.710 align:middle line:84%
And an additional fact
that's not that well known

00:15:54.710 --> 00:15:58.790 align:middle line:84%
is that he was represented,
even though I had spoken

00:15:58.790 --> 00:16:02.600 align:middle line:84%
with him earlier and had been
consulting with him legally

00:16:02.600 --> 00:16:07.580 align:middle line:84%
about the way that he
would go about doing this,

00:16:07.580 --> 00:16:11.270 align:middle line:84%
that he was actually legally
represented in presenting

00:16:11.270 --> 00:16:16.940 align:middle line:84%
that testimony by
the immediately,

00:16:16.940 --> 00:16:21.800 align:middle line:84%
recently retired Inspector
General of the United States

00:16:21.800 --> 00:16:23.320 align:middle line:90%
Intelligence Community.

00:16:23.320 --> 00:16:27.890 align:middle line:90%
That was Charles McCullough.

00:16:27.890 --> 00:16:33.140 align:middle line:84%
And so that means that not
only was his testimony cleared

00:16:33.140 --> 00:16:37.460 align:middle line:84%
by the official channels of the
United States national security

00:16:37.460 --> 00:16:40.910 align:middle line:84%
agencies, but he was
represented by the Inspector

00:16:40.910 --> 00:16:43.700 align:middle line:84%
General of the
intelligence community,

00:16:43.700 --> 00:16:45.320 align:middle line:90%
just recently retired.

00:16:45.320 --> 00:16:49.800 align:middle line:84%
Now, as you know, that
testimony followed

00:16:49.800 --> 00:16:55.350 align:middle line:84%
the previous public
testimony of Lou Elizondo.

00:16:55.350 --> 00:16:59.460 align:middle line:84%
Luis Elizondo, I'm
his attorney, I

00:16:59.460 --> 00:17:02.490 align:middle line:84%
represent Lou, and have
represented him for years now,

00:17:02.490 --> 00:17:07.170 align:middle line:84%
that he was the head of
the top secret Pentagon

00:17:07.170 --> 00:17:12.540 align:middle line:84%
program that was investigating
the UFO phenomenon.

00:17:12.540 --> 00:17:14.819 align:middle line:84%
He came on as the
chief of security

00:17:14.819 --> 00:17:18.720 align:middle line:84%
for this top secret
program back in 2007.

00:17:18.720 --> 00:17:21.180 align:middle line:84%
He served in that
capacity for two years.

00:17:21.180 --> 00:17:25.800 align:middle line:84%
And then in 2009, he became
the executive director

00:17:25.800 --> 00:17:30.870 align:middle line:84%
of this project that was named
The Advanced Aerospace Threat

00:17:30.870 --> 00:17:32.880 align:middle line:90%
Identification Program.

00:17:32.880 --> 00:17:36.330 align:middle line:84%
Now this was housed
inside what they

00:17:36.330 --> 00:17:39.960 align:middle line:84%
call Unacknowledged
Special Access

00:17:39.960 --> 00:17:42.660 align:middle line:90%
Program inside the Pentagon.

00:17:42.660 --> 00:17:49.700 align:middle line:84%
And it was called AUSAP,
A-U-S-A-P. And it was the AWSAP,

00:17:49.700 --> 00:17:53.950 align:middle line:84%
was the advanced weapons,
a special access program.

00:17:53.950 --> 00:17:55.890 align:middle line:84%
And so that what
this revealed was

00:17:55.890 --> 00:18:00.240 align:middle line:84%
is that the investigation
of the UFO phenomenon

00:18:00.240 --> 00:18:03.900 align:middle line:84%
on the part of the United States
Defense Department and Pentagon

00:18:03.900 --> 00:18:08.370 align:middle line:84%
was, in fact, part of the
advanced weapons development

00:18:08.370 --> 00:18:11.670 align:middle line:84%
program of our United
States' Pentagon.

00:18:11.670 --> 00:18:15.910 align:middle line:84%
And so that what we now realize
is that what that's showing is,

00:18:15.910 --> 00:18:18.850 align:middle line:84%
is that the efforts
to back engineer,

00:18:18.850 --> 00:18:23.590 align:middle line:84%
to back engineer the
technology of these UFOs

00:18:23.590 --> 00:18:27.100 align:middle line:84%
was actually being undertaken
as part of an effort

00:18:27.100 --> 00:18:33.440 align:middle line:84%
to develop a weapons system
using that technology.

00:18:33.440 --> 00:18:42.530 align:middle line:84%
And the arguments that have
been made now that have been

00:18:42.530 --> 00:18:47.600 align:middle line:84%
presented to me is that, well,
we had to try to develop this

00:18:47.600 --> 00:18:51.920 align:middle line:84%
technology in order to,
quote, "defend ourselves"

00:18:51.920 --> 00:18:57.500 align:middle line:90%
against the UFO phenomenon.

00:18:57.500 --> 00:19:00.860 align:middle line:84%
But the reality of it
is that those of us

00:19:00.860 --> 00:19:04.070 align:middle line:84%
who've been involved in this
type of work for 50 years, as I

00:19:04.070 --> 00:19:05.060 align:middle line:90%
have been.

00:19:05.060 --> 00:19:07.160 align:middle line:84%
As you may know
or may not know, I

00:19:07.160 --> 00:19:10.280 align:middle line:84%
was one of the attorneys
for The New York Times

00:19:10.280 --> 00:19:13.430 align:middle line:84%
in the Pentagon
papers case that we

00:19:13.430 --> 00:19:17.150 align:middle line:84%
were able to obtain the right
from the United States Supreme

00:19:17.150 --> 00:19:21.800 align:middle line:84%
Court to publish all 47 volumes
of the top secret internal

00:19:21.800 --> 00:19:25.400 align:middle line:84%
Pentagon study of the
causes in the development

00:19:25.400 --> 00:19:27.980 align:middle line:90%
of the war in Vietnam.

00:19:27.980 --> 00:19:30.410 align:middle line:84%
And the Nixon
administration then

00:19:30.410 --> 00:19:35.420 align:middle line:84%
tried to stop us from publishing
that, The New York Times,

00:19:35.420 --> 00:19:39.710 align:middle line:84%
arguing that the exposure of
any of the information that

00:19:39.710 --> 00:19:42.020 align:middle line:84%
was various information
in the 47 volumes,

00:19:42.020 --> 00:19:45.080 align:middle line:84%
which, if publicly
revealed, would irrevocably

00:19:45.080 --> 00:19:48.530 align:middle line:84%
damage the National security
of the United States.

00:19:48.530 --> 00:19:50.648 align:middle line:84%
And when we were
in chambers, when

00:19:50.648 --> 00:19:52.940 align:middle line:84%
they were asking for an
injunction against The New York

00:19:52.940 --> 00:19:56.842 align:middle line:84%
Times, when Whitney North
Seymour, the United States

00:19:56.842 --> 00:19:58.550 align:middle line:84%
Attorney for the
Southern District of New

00:19:58.550 --> 00:20:00.770 align:middle line:84%
York representing the
Nixon administration,

00:20:00.770 --> 00:20:04.370 align:middle line:84%
made that claim to judge
Murray Gurfein, said,

00:20:04.370 --> 00:20:07.190 align:middle line:84%
oh, there's information
in here that if revealed

00:20:07.190 --> 00:20:09.290 align:middle line:84%
to the American public,
will irrevocably damaged

00:20:09.290 --> 00:20:11.250 align:middle line:84%
the national security
of the United States.

00:20:11.250 --> 00:20:14.580 align:middle line:90%
I said to him, like what?

00:20:14.580 --> 00:20:20.230 align:middle line:84%
And he said, well, I can't tell
you because it's classified.

00:20:20.230 --> 00:20:22.050 align:middle line:84%
And you don't have the
adequate clearances

00:20:22.050 --> 00:20:23.590 align:middle line:90%
to be told the information.

00:20:23.590 --> 00:20:26.767 align:middle line:84%
And then so judge Gurfein
said to him, what about me?

00:20:26.767 --> 00:20:28.350 align:middle line:84%
You're coming here
to the court to try

00:20:28.350 --> 00:20:30.308 align:middle line:84%
to get an injunction
against The New York Times

00:20:30.308 --> 00:20:33.150 align:middle line:84%
to prohibit them
from publishing this.

00:20:33.150 --> 00:20:34.950 align:middle line:84%
You can certainly
tell me what it

00:20:34.950 --> 00:20:37.373 align:middle line:84%
is that's in the documents
that would irrevocably damaged

00:20:37.373 --> 00:20:39.790 align:middle line:84%
the national security of the
United States if made public.

00:20:39.790 --> 00:20:42.210 align:middle line:84%
And Murray Gurfein
said, no, no, you

00:20:42.210 --> 00:20:44.550 align:middle line:84%
don't have the security
clearances either.

00:20:44.550 --> 00:20:46.770 align:middle line:84%
And so they were actually
taking the position

00:20:46.770 --> 00:20:50.280 align:middle line:84%
that the court and The New York
Times and the American people

00:20:50.280 --> 00:20:54.450 align:middle line:84%
had to just take their word
for it, that there's something

00:20:54.450 --> 00:20:56.928 align:middle line:84%
in there that's going
to irrevocably damage

00:20:56.928 --> 00:20:58.720 align:middle line:84%
the national security
of the United States.

00:20:58.720 --> 00:21:01.600 align:middle line:84%
Well, as you probably
know, we won the case.

00:21:01.600 --> 00:21:03.910 align:middle line:90%
We published all 47 volumes.

00:21:03.910 --> 00:21:06.548 align:middle line:84%
And it did not, in
fact, irrevocably damage

00:21:06.548 --> 00:21:08.340 align:middle line:84%
the national security
of the United States,

00:21:08.340 --> 00:21:11.250 align:middle line:84%
but it did hasten the withdrawal
of the United States military

00:21:11.250 --> 00:21:15.970 align:middle line:84%
from Southeast Asia
invading the Vietnam.

00:21:15.970 --> 00:21:20.050 align:middle line:84%
And it revealed that they
were basing it on lies,

00:21:20.050 --> 00:21:23.200 align:middle line:84%
that they had intentionally
lied about the Bay of Tonkin

00:21:23.200 --> 00:21:24.080 align:middle line:90%
Resolution.

00:21:24.080 --> 00:21:25.880 align:middle line:90%
They lied to Congress about it.

00:21:25.880 --> 00:21:27.970 align:middle line:90%
They lied repeatedly.

00:21:27.970 --> 00:21:29.980 align:middle line:84%
And that what they were
doing is attempting

00:21:29.980 --> 00:21:33.910 align:middle line:84%
to establish a US military
foothold in Southeast Asia.

00:21:33.910 --> 00:21:36.760 align:middle line:84%
So they could get
privileged access

00:21:36.760 --> 00:21:39.070 align:middle line:84%
to the strategic
raw materials that

00:21:39.070 --> 00:21:42.220 align:middle line:84%
are available in the
Southeast Asian market.

00:21:42.220 --> 00:21:46.220 align:middle line:90%
And so that I have--

00:21:46.220 --> 00:21:50.290 align:middle line:84%
what I'm saying is,
is that this assertion

00:21:50.290 --> 00:21:53.050 align:middle line:84%
that they've been
making, that somehow

00:21:53.050 --> 00:21:58.480 align:middle line:84%
that they have to keep secret
the information about the UFO

00:21:58.480 --> 00:22:01.780 align:middle line:84%
phenomenon and technology
isn't, in fact,

00:22:01.780 --> 00:22:05.008 align:middle line:84%
because the revelation of it
is going to irrevocably damage

00:22:05.008 --> 00:22:07.300 align:middle line:84%
the national security of the
United States or anything.

00:22:07.300 --> 00:22:09.430 align:middle line:84%
But what they wanted
to do and it's now

00:22:09.430 --> 00:22:11.290 align:middle line:84%
proven by the
direct public record

00:22:11.290 --> 00:22:15.310 align:middle line:84%
is they wanted to use it
for a weapons technology.

00:22:15.310 --> 00:22:20.260 align:middle line:84%
And we know is that without
getting too far afield,

00:22:20.260 --> 00:22:26.470 align:middle line:84%
we know that at the end of the
Cold War on December 31 of 1991

00:22:26.470 --> 00:22:30.130 align:middle line:84%
when President Gorbachev
of the Soviet Union

00:22:30.130 --> 00:22:32.290 align:middle line:84%
signed the agreement,
releasing all

00:22:32.290 --> 00:22:36.760 align:middle line:84%
of the republics of the former
union of Soviet Socialist

00:22:36.760 --> 00:22:39.460 align:middle line:84%
Republics and allowed
them to go free.

00:22:39.460 --> 00:22:43.150 align:middle line:84%
The first thing that happened
is that the George Bush

00:22:43.150 --> 00:22:47.500 align:middle line:84%
senior administration, the
Secretary of Defense of which

00:22:47.500 --> 00:22:53.950 align:middle line:84%
was, as you know, later Vice
President Dick Cheney, who

00:22:53.950 --> 00:22:56.020 align:middle line:90%
was the Secretary of Defense.

00:22:56.020 --> 00:23:00.910 align:middle line:84%
He convened his staff, Paul
Wolfowitz and Scooter Libby

00:23:00.910 --> 00:23:03.700 align:middle line:90%
and Doug Feith and others.

00:23:03.700 --> 00:23:08.680 align:middle line:84%
And they prepared a 1992 United
States Defense Department policy

00:23:08.680 --> 00:23:11.830 align:middle line:84%
planning guidance document
in which they insisted that

00:23:11.830 --> 00:23:15.490 align:middle line:84%
even though the Soviet Union
had voluntarily stepped

00:23:15.490 --> 00:23:18.400 align:middle line:90%
back away from the Cold War.

00:23:18.400 --> 00:23:20.980 align:middle line:84%
And was willing to
negotiate the disassembly

00:23:20.980 --> 00:23:24.760 align:middle line:84%
of the nuclear weapons,
that they shouldn't

00:23:24.760 --> 00:23:27.250 align:middle line:84%
do that because it
was going to cause

00:23:27.250 --> 00:23:29.970 align:middle line:84%
a diminution of their
military budget.

00:23:29.970 --> 00:23:31.600 align:middle line:84%
And so that what
they wanted to do

00:23:31.600 --> 00:23:34.630 align:middle line:84%
is they wanted to increase
the military budget

00:23:34.630 --> 00:23:38.080 align:middle line:84%
so that they could take this
unique opportunity in history

00:23:38.080 --> 00:23:43.580 align:middle line:84%
to establish full spectrum
dominance over the planet.

00:23:43.580 --> 00:23:47.840 align:middle line:84%
And that they would therefore be
able to maintain their continued

00:23:47.840 --> 00:23:52.340 align:middle line:84%
privileged access to the
strategic raw materials needed

00:23:52.340 --> 00:23:57.760 align:middle line:84%
by the members of what
would become a new alliance,

00:23:57.760 --> 00:24:02.770 align:middle line:84%
which would include the
United states, Canada, Mexico,

00:24:02.770 --> 00:24:08.080 align:middle line:84%
not the Mexican people, but the
pre, the Spanish Castilian--

00:24:08.080 --> 00:24:11.320 align:middle line:84%
Castilian Spanish
political party in Mexico.

00:24:11.320 --> 00:24:18.830 align:middle line:84%
The UK, France, Italy, the new
reunified Germany, and even

00:24:18.830 --> 00:24:22.910 align:middle line:84%
Russia, to be invited
into this new alliance

00:24:22.910 --> 00:24:27.980 align:middle line:84%
now that they had spun off
all of the ethnic provinces

00:24:27.980 --> 00:24:29.950 align:middle line:90%
of Russia.

00:24:29.950 --> 00:24:31.790 align:middle line:84%
Now you just step back
for just one moment.

00:24:31.790 --> 00:24:33.050 align:middle line:90%
And we have a copy of that.

00:24:33.050 --> 00:24:37.690 align:middle line:84%
That's a classified document,
the 1992 United States Defense

00:24:37.690 --> 00:24:40.497 align:middle line:84%
Department Policy Planning
Guidance document.

00:24:40.497 --> 00:24:42.580 align:middle line:84%
If you step back just a
moment, what you'll notice

00:24:42.580 --> 00:24:48.550 align:middle line:84%
is that all of those are
basically Caucasian nations.

00:24:48.550 --> 00:24:51.310 align:middle line:84%
That's what they have in
common, those countries,

00:24:51.310 --> 00:24:53.890 align:middle line:84%
including Russia, now
that they've spun off

00:24:53.890 --> 00:24:55.970 align:middle line:90%
all of their ethnic provinces.

00:24:55.970 --> 00:24:58.120 align:middle line:84%
So you start to become
aware of the fact

00:24:58.120 --> 00:25:03.790 align:middle line:84%
that the reason for wanting to
keep secret, the fact that they

00:25:03.790 --> 00:25:08.650 align:middle line:84%
had possession of UFO craft
and were engaged secretly

00:25:08.650 --> 00:25:11.500 align:middle line:84%
in an attempt to back
engineer or reverse

00:25:11.500 --> 00:25:14.860 align:middle line:84%
engineer, this
technology was to develop

00:25:14.860 --> 00:25:20.440 align:middle line:84%
an advanced weapon in the
Advanced Weapons Special Access

00:25:20.440 --> 00:25:21.760 align:middle line:90%
Program.

00:25:21.760 --> 00:25:25.600 align:middle line:84%
And it was to be used
to not defend themselves

00:25:25.600 --> 00:25:28.900 align:middle line:84%
against the UFO
civilization, but in fact

00:25:28.900 --> 00:25:31.330 align:middle line:84%
to be able to promote
and promulgate

00:25:31.330 --> 00:25:33.610 align:middle line:84%
their plan to
establish full spectrum

00:25:33.610 --> 00:25:37.750 align:middle line:84%
dominance over the planet,
to maintain our continued

00:25:37.750 --> 00:25:41.020 align:middle line:84%
privileged access to the
strategic raw materials that

00:25:41.020 --> 00:25:44.590 align:middle line:84%
were deemed to be needed
by us and other members

00:25:44.590 --> 00:25:49.328 align:middle line:84%
of this new northern
Atlantic alliance.

00:25:49.328 --> 00:25:55.910 align:middle line:84%
So that's just another fact
that I want to put forth to you

00:25:55.910 --> 00:26:05.330 align:middle line:84%
here today, because you realize
that when Lou Elizondo decided

00:26:05.330 --> 00:26:10.970 align:middle line:84%
that he was going to come
forward publicly and bring

00:26:10.970 --> 00:26:13.700 align:middle line:84%
to The New York
Times in December

00:26:13.700 --> 00:26:22.100 align:middle line:84%
of 2017 videos of these three
major F-18 Super Hornet gun

00:26:22.100 --> 00:26:27.080 align:middle line:90%
camera videos of the Tic Tac.

00:26:27.080 --> 00:26:30.050 align:middle line:84%
And the Gimbal and
the Fast Walker

00:26:30.050 --> 00:26:34.160 align:middle line:84%
that these three
different videos, he

00:26:34.160 --> 00:26:38.870 align:middle line:84%
was joined in that
effort by Chris Mellon.

00:26:38.870 --> 00:26:42.620 align:middle line:84%
And Christopher Mellon was
the Assistant Secretary

00:26:42.620 --> 00:26:46.460 align:middle line:84%
of Defense for Intelligence
under both the Carter

00:26:46.460 --> 00:26:51.810 align:middle line:84%
administration and under that
George W. Bush administration.

00:26:51.810 --> 00:26:57.120 align:middle line:84%
And the fact is that the
release of those videos

00:26:57.120 --> 00:27:02.730 align:middle line:84%
was explicitly cleared by the
National Security functions

00:27:02.730 --> 00:27:06.610 align:middle line:90%
inside our government.

00:27:06.610 --> 00:27:09.700 align:middle line:84%
So this effort on
the part of people

00:27:09.700 --> 00:27:14.950 align:middle line:84%
like David Grusch and
Charles McCullough,

00:27:14.950 --> 00:27:18.730 align:middle line:84%
the former Inspector General
of the Intelligence Community,

00:27:18.730 --> 00:27:23.110 align:middle line:84%
the release of the videos
by Christopher Mellon

00:27:23.110 --> 00:27:28.000 align:middle line:84%
and Lou Elizondo have been
authorized by the United States

00:27:28.000 --> 00:27:31.350 align:middle line:84%
government to release
this information.

00:27:31.350 --> 00:27:35.000 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:27:35.000 --> 00:27:38.000 align:middle line:90%
