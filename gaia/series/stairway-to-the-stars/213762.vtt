[THEME MUSIC]

00:00:08.211 --> 00:00:11.592 align:middle line:90%


00:00:11.592 --> 00:00:14.750 align:middle line:84%
>> All right, so now what I'm
going to talk to you about is

00:00:14.750 --> 00:00:17.660 align:middle line:90%
the alchemical process.

00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:20.270 align:middle line:10%
The alchemical process
is very complicated,

00:00:20.270 --> 00:00:24.720 align:middle line:10%
but it can be summarized
down into some key points.

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:27.740 align:middle line:84%
And so I'm going to
talk about these points,

00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:30.020 align:middle line:84%
and I'm going to show
you how this related

00:00:30.020 --> 00:00:35.180 align:middle line:84%
to the ancient Egyptian
myths of the god Osiris

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:38.300 align:middle line:84%
and how this relates to
all of this technology

00:00:38.300 --> 00:00:39.685 align:middle line:90%
that we're finding in Egypt.

00:00:39.685 --> 00:00:42.680 align:middle line:90%


00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:43.480 align:middle line:90%
All right.

00:00:43.480 --> 00:00:47.910 align:middle line:84%
So according to the alchemists,
alchemical traditions,

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:52.200 align:middle line:84%
they said that our
chemical process is first

00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:55.170 align:middle line:84%
begun by studying the
classical elements.

00:00:55.170 --> 00:01:00.720 align:middle line:84%
The classical elements were
earth, water, air, and fire,

00:01:00.720 --> 00:01:05.370 align:middle line:84%
with a fifth element known as
the aether, or the quintessence.

00:01:05.370 --> 00:01:08.860 align:middle line:84%
In modern vernacular, we would
call it the quantum field.

00:01:08.860 --> 00:01:13.250 align:middle line:84%
This is what all the
elements percolate out of.

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:19.670 align:middle line:84%
But these states of matter, of
earth, water, air, and fire,

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:23.960 align:middle line:84%
in modern language, we could say
they relate to solids, liquids,

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:29.700 align:middle line:84%
gases, and plasma, and that they
all develop out of each other.

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:32.240 align:middle line:84%
If you think of a match,
if you light a match,

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:37.230 align:middle line:84%
the match is a physical
thing, so that would be Earth.

00:01:37.230 --> 00:01:40.100 align:middle line:84%
As it's lit, there
is perspiration

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:42.980 align:middle line:84%
that starts to come off of it,
or water, as the oils come out

00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:46.700 align:middle line:90%
of the match.

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:49.430 align:middle line:90%
Those oils catch on fire.

00:01:49.430 --> 00:01:51.260 align:middle line:90%
Obviously there's the air.

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:54.620 align:middle line:84%
In fact, you can even see
a space between the match

00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:57.860 align:middle line:90%
and the fire, an air space.

00:01:57.860 --> 00:02:01.320 align:middle line:90%
And then fire-- going to fire.

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:05.310 align:middle line:84%
So it goes from most
dense to least dense.

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:08.530 align:middle line:84%
In the alchemical
language though,

00:02:08.530 --> 00:02:17.950 align:middle line:84%
these also related to
states of purification

00:02:17.950 --> 00:02:20.440 align:middle line:90%
through the alchemical process.

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:23.110 align:middle line:84%
So the Earth would
represent the raw element

00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:25.510 align:middle line:84%
that you were working with,
that you started with,

00:02:25.510 --> 00:02:31.460 align:middle line:84%
whether that be herbs
or metals or minerals,

00:02:31.460 --> 00:02:35.630 align:middle line:84%
but something that was
collected from the Earth itself.

00:02:35.630 --> 00:02:37.370 align:middle line:84%
Then the first stage
that you had to do

00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:39.870 align:middle line:84%
was something that was
referred to as digestion.

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:44.270 align:middle line:84%
You had to put this
substance in a vessel that

00:02:44.270 --> 00:02:50.750 align:middle line:84%
had a liquid in it that would
help to digest or break down

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:52.910 align:middle line:90%
that material body.

00:02:52.910 --> 00:02:58.820 align:middle line:84%
And depending on what body
you started with, this would--

00:02:58.820 --> 00:03:01.070 align:middle line:84%
the liquid then that
you had to use to digest

00:03:01.070 --> 00:03:01.890 align:middle line:90%
would be different.

00:03:01.890 --> 00:03:08.330 align:middle line:84%
I mean, so for example, an herb,
you might use an alcohol or even

00:03:08.330 --> 00:03:11.810 align:middle line:84%
water to digest it, whereas if
you're working with a metal,

00:03:11.810 --> 00:03:13.730 align:middle line:90%
you'd have to use an acid.

00:03:13.730 --> 00:03:16.350 align:middle line:84%
Or certain minerals,
you'd have to use an acid.

00:03:16.350 --> 00:03:19.730 align:middle line:84%
But either way, it was
some sort of a liquid,

00:03:19.730 --> 00:03:23.860 align:middle line:90%
and the herb would digest it.

00:03:23.860 --> 00:03:27.430 align:middle line:84%
The air was associated
with distillation.

00:03:27.430 --> 00:03:30.770 align:middle line:84%
Air distillation
process is, that liquid

00:03:30.770 --> 00:03:34.610 align:middle line:84%
then you heat it and
turn it into a gas.

00:03:34.610 --> 00:03:38.330 align:middle line:84%
And that gas usually
flies up and then

00:03:38.330 --> 00:03:42.062 align:middle line:90%
is captured in another vessel.

00:03:42.062 --> 00:03:47.070 align:middle line:84%
The elements of that gas are
then captured in another vessel.

00:03:47.070 --> 00:03:52.030 align:middle line:84%
This is just like how we
distill alcohol, right?

00:03:52.030 --> 00:03:53.960 align:middle line:84%
We have all of
these ingredients.

00:03:53.960 --> 00:03:56.950 align:middle line:84%
We put some sugar in
there, some yeast,

00:03:56.950 --> 00:04:00.560 align:middle line:90%
and it starts to produce gas.

00:04:00.560 --> 00:04:04.100 align:middle line:84%
And this gas can then
go and be captured.

00:04:04.100 --> 00:04:06.430 align:middle line:84%
And if we heat it,
that's literally

00:04:06.430 --> 00:04:11.770 align:middle line:84%
where we get the alcohol to
come over into another vessel.

00:04:11.770 --> 00:04:13.780 align:middle line:84%
So air was associated
with distillation

00:04:13.780 --> 00:04:18.130 align:middle line:84%
because the liquid turned
into a gas, into an air.

00:04:18.130 --> 00:04:20.630 align:middle line:84%
And then the last
stage was calcination,

00:04:20.630 --> 00:04:22.540 align:middle line:84%
and this is where you
took the original Earth

00:04:22.540 --> 00:04:26.590 align:middle line:84%
body after all the elements
and minerals and everything had

00:04:26.590 --> 00:04:30.290 align:middle line:84%
been leached out of it through
digestion and distillation.

00:04:30.290 --> 00:04:34.300 align:middle line:84%
And what you had left over
at the bottom of the flask

00:04:34.300 --> 00:04:40.460 align:middle line:84%
was this substance that
the alchemists sometimes

00:04:40.460 --> 00:04:43.190 align:middle line:84%
referred to it as
feces, because it looked

00:04:43.190 --> 00:04:46.478 align:middle line:90%
and smelled like shit, right?

00:04:46.478 --> 00:04:49.380 align:middle line:84%
But this remnant,
after everything

00:04:49.380 --> 00:04:54.610 align:middle line:84%
had been leached out of it,
had to then be calcinated down.

00:04:54.610 --> 00:04:56.330 align:middle line:90%
Now, it was subjected to fire.

00:04:56.330 --> 00:04:59.620 align:middle line:84%
It was put in a crucible,
and this would then

00:04:59.620 --> 00:05:02.500 align:middle line:84%
turn the substance
eventually into an ash.

00:05:02.500 --> 00:05:06.910 align:middle line:84%
And out of those ashes could
then be extracted a secret salt.

00:05:06.910 --> 00:05:13.980 align:middle line:84%
And that secret salt, there
was both a soluble salt

00:05:13.980 --> 00:05:15.760 align:middle line:90%
and an insoluble salt.

00:05:15.760 --> 00:05:20.190 align:middle line:84%
And the soluble salt was
usually the minerals associated

00:05:20.190 --> 00:05:22.960 align:middle line:84%
with that herb or whatever
you were working on.

00:05:22.960 --> 00:05:25.530 align:middle line:84%
The insoluble
salts were actually

00:05:25.530 --> 00:05:32.650 align:middle line:84%
the manna, the hidden
manna, this white powder

00:05:32.650 --> 00:05:35.880 align:middle line:90%
that we'll get into.

00:05:35.880 --> 00:05:42.850 align:middle line:84%
This process was adopted
by religious traditions

00:05:42.850 --> 00:05:46.160 align:middle line:90%
all over the world.

00:05:46.160 --> 00:05:51.020 align:middle line:90%
The Gnostics set up baptisms.

00:05:51.020 --> 00:05:53.300 align:middle line:84%
And so these, on
the left here, you

00:05:53.300 --> 00:05:56.630 align:middle line:84%
see some of the words associated
with in the Gnostic tradition.

00:05:56.630 --> 00:06:01.340 align:middle line:10%
So they said someone who
is born into the earth, who

00:06:01.340 --> 00:06:03.200 align:middle line:10%
had no knowledge
of anything else

00:06:03.200 --> 00:06:07.220 align:middle line:10%
but just the physical world,
they referred to them as hylics,

00:06:07.220 --> 00:06:09.110 align:middle line:10%
and they were associated
with the Earth.

00:06:09.110 --> 00:06:12.410 align:middle line:84%
These were people that were
totally obsessed with material

00:06:12.410 --> 00:06:13.590 align:middle line:90%
things, and that's it.

00:06:13.590 --> 00:06:17.060 align:middle line:84%
They think that's
all there is to life.

00:06:17.060 --> 00:06:22.190 align:middle line:84%
These are the people
who look forward

00:06:22.190 --> 00:06:26.340 align:middle line:84%
to having sex and a good bowel
movement, and that's about it.

00:06:26.340 --> 00:06:29.380 align:middle line:84%
Then collecting as many toys as
they can get before they die,

00:06:29.380 --> 00:06:30.180 align:middle line:90%
and that's it.

00:06:30.180 --> 00:06:32.640 align:middle line:84%
They don't think
any deeper about it.

00:06:32.640 --> 00:06:38.070 align:middle line:84%
But the Gnostics had initiation,
and the Templar tradition

00:06:38.070 --> 00:06:40.650 align:middle line:84%
preserved this, and you find
this also within the Egyptian,

00:06:40.650 --> 00:06:44.360 align:middle line:84%
which we'll talk about,
was about taking people

00:06:44.360 --> 00:06:47.600 align:middle line:84%
from this earth level
and then initiating them

00:06:47.600 --> 00:06:52.220 align:middle line:84%
through a baptism by water
into this next level, which

00:06:52.220 --> 00:06:55.070 align:middle line:84%
was known as the psychic
level, or the hearers.

00:06:55.070 --> 00:06:57.440 align:middle line:10%
And what this
represented, the water

00:06:57.440 --> 00:07:01.340 align:middle line:10%
represented the emotions,
the emotional body.

00:07:01.340 --> 00:07:05.330 align:middle line:84%
And the Templar said that--
within the Templar tradition,

00:07:05.330 --> 00:07:08.060 align:middle line:84%
within the initiatic tradition,
the Gnostic tradition,

00:07:08.060 --> 00:07:12.930 align:middle line:84%
that water, again,
represented the emotions

00:07:12.930 --> 00:07:17.230 align:middle line:84%
and that those emotions
have an energy to it, right?

00:07:17.230 --> 00:07:23.920 align:middle line:84%
And that most people,
they get really emotional,

00:07:23.920 --> 00:07:26.200 align:middle line:84%
and they just drown
in their emotions.

00:07:26.200 --> 00:07:28.868 align:middle line:84%
They waste their
emotional energy.

00:07:28.868 --> 00:07:30.910 align:middle line:84%
In fact, that's literally
where the term drowning

00:07:30.910 --> 00:07:32.920 align:middle line:90%
in your emotions comes from.

00:07:32.920 --> 00:07:34.870 align:middle line:90%
You're drowning in the water.

00:07:34.870 --> 00:07:37.090 align:middle line:84%
So the goal of this
first level was

00:07:37.090 --> 00:07:40.130 align:middle line:84%
to learn to be able
to walk on water.

00:07:40.130 --> 00:07:42.540 align:middle line:84%
This didn't mean you were
actually walking on water.

00:07:42.540 --> 00:07:45.980 align:middle line:84%
What it meant is, can you
stabilize your emotions

00:07:45.980 --> 00:07:49.400 align:middle line:84%
so that you can stand on
them and use that energy

00:07:49.400 --> 00:07:51.770 align:middle line:84%
to bring about
transformation in the world?

00:07:51.770 --> 00:07:56.150 align:middle line:84%
So this was the first
stage of the initiate.

00:07:56.150 --> 00:08:00.100 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes they would refer to
it as subduing the passions.

00:08:00.100 --> 00:08:01.670 align:middle line:90%
Can you subdue your passions?

00:08:01.670 --> 00:08:04.220 align:middle line:84%
Not get rid of your
passions, but instead,

00:08:04.220 --> 00:08:07.030 align:middle line:84%
use it as an energy
for transformation.

00:08:07.030 --> 00:08:09.550 align:middle line:84%
Once someone had
done that, then they

00:08:09.550 --> 00:08:13.360 align:middle line:84%
would receive the next level of
initiation, which was referred

00:08:13.360 --> 00:08:15.140 align:middle line:90%
to as the pneumatic stage.

00:08:15.140 --> 00:08:19.090 align:middle line:10%
Pneumatic had to do with air
and it had to do with the mind.

00:08:19.090 --> 00:08:22.390 align:middle line:10%
So there was usually
a baptism of air,

00:08:22.390 --> 00:08:25.690 align:middle line:10%
and then the person
was instructed

00:08:25.690 --> 00:08:29.170 align:middle line:10%
to start to develop their mind.

00:08:29.170 --> 00:08:32.350 align:middle line:84%
Not to just memorize
facts so they

00:08:32.350 --> 00:08:34.600 align:middle line:84%
could be good at Trivial
Pursuit or whatever,

00:08:34.600 --> 00:08:37.929 align:middle line:84%
but rather, it was
believed at this stage,

00:08:37.929 --> 00:08:40.330 align:middle line:84%
that they began to
study the liberal arts

00:08:40.330 --> 00:08:45.970 align:middle line:84%
and sciences with the purpose of
learning to recognize that there

00:08:45.970 --> 00:08:50.650 align:middle line:84%
is an order to all creation
and that everything appears

00:08:50.650 --> 00:08:54.240 align:middle line:90%
to be separate and distinct.

00:08:54.240 --> 00:08:57.540 align:middle line:84%
At this stage, they were trying
to bring it together back

00:08:57.540 --> 00:08:59.130 align:middle line:90%
into oneness.

00:08:59.130 --> 00:09:04.380 align:middle line:84%
In the myths of Osiris,
he's chopped up.

00:09:04.380 --> 00:09:05.670 align:middle line:90%
He's the vegetation god.

00:09:05.670 --> 00:09:06.870 align:middle line:90%
He's green.

00:09:06.870 --> 00:09:07.690 align:middle line:90%
He's chopped up.

00:09:07.690 --> 00:09:11.920 align:middle line:84%
He's thrown in the
Nile, baptism of water.

00:09:11.920 --> 00:09:18.580 align:middle line:84%
And then Isis goes, and she
collects the pieces of Osiris.

00:09:18.580 --> 00:09:20.890 align:middle line:84%
And she turns
herself into a bird

00:09:20.890 --> 00:09:24.190 align:middle line:84%
and flies around
him, getting air.

00:09:24.190 --> 00:09:27.020 align:middle line:84%
And she puts the
pieces back together.

00:09:27.020 --> 00:09:29.740 align:middle line:84%
She brings it back
into the oneness.

00:09:29.740 --> 00:09:31.627 align:middle line:84%
So this was the goal
of this stage, right?

00:09:31.627 --> 00:09:33.127 align:middle line:84%
And it's really the
goal of science,

00:09:33.127 --> 00:09:35.330 align:middle line:90%
if we want to be honest.

00:09:35.330 --> 00:09:37.510 align:middle line:84%
I mean, the whole
science wouldn't

00:09:37.510 --> 00:09:39.610 align:middle line:84%
exist unless we believed
there was a greater

00:09:39.610 --> 00:09:41.630 align:middle line:90%
order to our universe, right?

00:09:41.630 --> 00:09:43.240 align:middle line:84%
So the whole purpose
of science is

00:09:43.240 --> 00:09:47.890 align:middle line:84%
to learn to break down the
parts and then put them

00:09:47.890 --> 00:09:50.290 align:middle line:84%
back together into
a greater order

00:09:50.290 --> 00:09:53.410 align:middle line:84%
so we understand the greater
order to the universe.

00:09:53.410 --> 00:09:57.070 align:middle line:84%
To the alchemists, they believe
that all reality was existing

00:09:57.070 --> 00:09:59.415 align:middle line:90%
within a mind of the creator.

00:09:59.415 --> 00:10:02.020 align:middle line:90%


00:10:02.020 --> 00:10:03.380 align:middle line:90%
I'll say that again.

00:10:03.380 --> 00:10:08.500 align:middle line:84%
The alchemists believed that
all reality that we perceive

00:10:08.500 --> 00:10:10.570 align:middle line:84%
and that we touch
and we interact with

00:10:10.570 --> 00:10:15.050 align:middle line:84%
is actually within the
mind of the creator.

00:10:15.050 --> 00:10:17.570 align:middle line:90%
It's kind of matrixy, right?

00:10:17.570 --> 00:10:21.980 align:middle line:84%
But it was because they believed
that if you were the creator

00:10:21.980 --> 00:10:24.740 align:middle line:84%
and you were all
that was, that means

00:10:24.740 --> 00:10:28.097 align:middle line:84%
there was nothing outside of
yourself in the beginning.

00:10:28.097 --> 00:10:29.680 align:middle line:84%
And the only way you
could create then

00:10:29.680 --> 00:10:32.350 align:middle line:84%
if there's nothing outside
of yourself to create with,

00:10:32.350 --> 00:10:35.940 align:middle line:84%
the only way that you could
create was within your own mind.

00:10:35.940 --> 00:10:41.770 align:middle line:84%
And therefore, all creation is
within the mind of the creator.

00:10:41.770 --> 00:10:46.610 align:middle line:84%
And just as we're a
microcosm of that macrocosm,

00:10:46.610 --> 00:10:49.340 align:middle line:84%
so just as our
thoughts can change,

00:10:49.340 --> 00:10:52.190 align:middle line:84%
the creator's
thoughts can change.

00:10:52.190 --> 00:10:55.820 align:middle line:84%
And hence, why we have change
in the world all the time.

00:10:55.820 --> 00:10:59.202 align:middle line:84%
But the goal-- the alchemists
believed the goal of that was--

00:10:59.202 --> 00:11:01.160 align:middle line:84%
and the Gnostics believed
that the goal of that

00:11:01.160 --> 00:11:06.590 align:middle line:84%
was to get us to the
point where we're also

00:11:06.590 --> 00:11:10.010 align:middle line:84%
at the same type of mind
state with the creator.

00:11:10.010 --> 00:11:12.050 align:middle line:84%
And that was referred
to as the Christos,

00:11:12.050 --> 00:11:14.850 align:middle line:84%
the universal consciousness
that they're trying to get to.

00:11:14.850 --> 00:11:17.420 align:middle line:84%
And that's why the
Sophia, the wisdom,

00:11:17.420 --> 00:11:20.180 align:middle line:84%
the universal-- the
individual soul,

00:11:20.180 --> 00:11:24.380 align:middle line:84%
had to wed with that
universal consciousness.

00:11:24.380 --> 00:11:26.580 align:middle line:90%
So this was the air stage.

00:11:26.580 --> 00:11:29.610 align:middle line:10%
And then finally, the
fire stage was the gnosis.

00:11:29.610 --> 00:11:32.360 align:middle line:10%
And usually what happened to
the Gnostics between this stage

00:11:32.360 --> 00:11:35.120 align:middle line:10%
and this stage is they
symbolically killed

00:11:35.120 --> 00:11:38.660 align:middle line:10%
the candidate,
because it represented

00:11:38.660 --> 00:11:41.720 align:middle line:10%
the dying to your old lower
self, your old attachment

00:11:41.720 --> 00:11:44.360 align:middle line:10%
to the physical world.

00:11:44.360 --> 00:11:48.650 align:middle line:84%
And then they raise them to
a new life and a new light

00:11:48.650 --> 00:11:51.620 align:middle line:84%
of understanding with
the idea that they then

00:11:51.620 --> 00:11:54.950 align:middle line:84%
understood the oneness of
how everything went together.

00:11:54.950 --> 00:11:59.160 align:middle line:84%
So this was the initiatic
process, but it was also--

00:11:59.160 --> 00:12:02.670 align:middle line:84%
it was based on the
alchemical process,

00:12:02.670 --> 00:12:06.510 align:middle line:84%
and it was just adopted
in different ways.

00:12:06.510 --> 00:12:09.860 align:middle line:84%
Now within the
Egyptian tradition,

00:12:09.860 --> 00:12:12.360 align:middle line:90%
this is the god Osiris up here.

00:12:12.360 --> 00:12:17.400 align:middle line:84%
He's painted green because he
represents the vegetation state.

00:12:17.400 --> 00:12:20.630 align:middle line:84%
In fact, this is really
the origin of the Green Man

00:12:20.630 --> 00:12:23.180 align:middle line:84%
that's found on the
cathedrals and chapels

00:12:23.180 --> 00:12:26.570 align:middle line:90%
and such around Europe.

00:12:26.570 --> 00:12:30.710 align:middle line:84%
It was based on Osiris
being the vegetation god.

00:12:30.710 --> 00:12:34.760 align:middle line:84%
There are two plants in
Egypt that the Egyptians were

00:12:34.760 --> 00:12:40.520 align:middle line:84%
working with alchemically and
that the Templars learned about.

00:12:40.520 --> 00:12:44.840 align:middle line:84%
The first is this
thorny plant that you'll

00:12:44.840 --> 00:12:48.080 align:middle line:84%
see growing around
all the monuments,

00:12:48.080 --> 00:12:53.170 align:middle line:84%
and its scientific
name is Dichapetalum.

00:12:53.170 --> 00:12:55.990 align:middle line:84%
When you do these
processes, these alchemical

00:12:55.990 --> 00:12:59.070 align:middle line:84%
processes to this
plant, what you're

00:12:59.070 --> 00:13:03.780 align:middle line:84%
able to extract out of that
plant is hydrofluoric acid.

00:13:03.780 --> 00:13:07.200 align:middle line:84%
This is one of the great
secrets in the ancient world.

00:13:07.200 --> 00:13:10.800 align:middle line:84%
Hydrofluoric acid eats
through everything.

00:13:10.800 --> 00:13:13.080 align:middle line:84%
In fact, the only things
it doesn't eat through

00:13:13.080 --> 00:13:17.020 align:middle line:90%
are gold and beeswax.

00:13:17.020 --> 00:13:20.710 align:middle line:84%
So the Egyptians figured out
that they could create a--

00:13:20.710 --> 00:13:23.860 align:middle line:84%
they could take a
granite structure,

00:13:23.860 --> 00:13:28.690 align:middle line:84%
they could put a
beeswax template on it,

00:13:28.690 --> 00:13:30.370 align:middle line:84%
and then they
could create a wash

00:13:30.370 --> 00:13:31.820 align:middle line:90%
with this hydrofluoric acid.

00:13:31.820 --> 00:13:34.420 align:middle line:84%
And the hydrophilic
acid would eat away

00:13:34.420 --> 00:13:39.430 align:middle line:84%
at the silica in the granite,
and they could create--

00:13:39.430 --> 00:13:42.940 align:middle line:84%
they could shape the granite,
and they could cut the granite

00:13:42.940 --> 00:13:44.270 align:middle line:90%
with this process.

00:13:44.270 --> 00:13:49.250 align:middle line:84%
And they could also create
an etching on the granite.

00:13:49.250 --> 00:13:51.850 align:middle line:84%
So this is how they were
etching these granite structures

00:13:51.850 --> 00:13:54.770 align:middle line:84%
with the hydrofluoric
acid from this plant.

00:13:54.770 --> 00:13:59.690 align:middle line:84%
By the way, this is something
the Templar tradition

00:13:59.690 --> 00:14:01.340 align:middle line:90%
has known for a long time.

00:14:01.340 --> 00:14:06.080 align:middle line:84%
I just presented this to the
Egyptian antiquities this year.

00:14:06.080 --> 00:14:11.830 align:middle line:84%
They were blown away by
it, because they had always

00:14:11.830 --> 00:14:13.810 align:middle line:84%
known that a bunch
of these monuments

00:14:13.810 --> 00:14:20.230 align:middle line:84%
had evidence of melting of the
stone and also had evidence of--

00:14:20.230 --> 00:14:23.050 align:middle line:84%
they found a number of these
monuments that still had beeswax

00:14:23.050 --> 00:14:24.592 align:middle line:84%
on them, and they
couldn't figure out

00:14:24.592 --> 00:14:27.380 align:middle line:84%
what the Egyptians were doing,
putting beeswax on these things.

00:14:27.380 --> 00:14:28.990 align:middle line:90%
Well, this is why.

00:14:28.990 --> 00:14:33.730 align:middle line:84%
Because the beeswax stops
the hydrofluoric acid

00:14:33.730 --> 00:14:36.040 align:middle line:84%
that you can extract
from this plant.

00:14:36.040 --> 00:14:38.800 align:middle line:84%
The other plant that's
found throughout Egypt

00:14:38.800 --> 00:14:46.470 align:middle line:84%
is the tamarisk, and the
tamarisk is full of manna.

00:14:46.470 --> 00:14:50.400 align:middle line:84%
It's also full of
dimethyltryptamine,

00:14:50.400 --> 00:14:52.820 align:middle line:90%
otherwise known as DMT.

00:14:52.820 --> 00:14:55.310 align:middle line:84%
And so when you do the
alchemical processes

00:14:55.310 --> 00:15:01.580 align:middle line:84%
to this plant, it actually--
you can ex-- the soluble salts

00:15:01.580 --> 00:15:04.460 align:middle line:90%
that you extract out is the DMT.

00:15:04.460 --> 00:15:06.860 align:middle line:84%
The insoluble salts
that you extract out

00:15:06.860 --> 00:15:10.710 align:middle line:84%
is this manna, OK,
this white powder.

00:15:10.710 --> 00:15:12.310 align:middle line:84%
This is what the
Egyptians were doing.

00:15:12.310 --> 00:15:18.570 align:middle line:84%
And so the Egyptian myths,
Osiris, the Green Man,

00:15:18.570 --> 00:15:22.710 align:middle line:84%
he goes to his birthday party,
and his brother Seth tricks him,

00:15:22.710 --> 00:15:26.490 align:middle line:84%
throws him in a coffin, and
cuts him into a bunch of pieces,

00:15:26.490 --> 00:15:28.870 align:middle line:90%
chops him up.

00:15:28.870 --> 00:15:31.480 align:middle line:84%
And then he's thrown
into the Nile.

00:15:31.480 --> 00:15:34.270 align:middle line:84%
The goddess Isis
goes out to find him.

00:15:34.270 --> 00:15:38.700 align:middle line:84%
The goddess Isis turns
herself into a bird,

00:15:38.700 --> 00:15:41.730 align:middle line:84%
flies around him,
reassembles him.

00:15:41.730 --> 00:15:46.440 align:middle line:84%
And then she lights
oil lamps and incense,

00:15:46.440 --> 00:15:49.250 align:middle line:90%
and she raises him back to life.

00:15:49.250 --> 00:15:51.330 align:middle line:84%
Well, this is the
alchemical process,

00:15:51.330 --> 00:15:55.280 align:middle line:84%
and we're going to talk about
that some more, but specifically

00:15:55.280 --> 00:15:57.530 align:middle line:90%
related to these two plants.

00:15:57.530 --> 00:15:58.720 align:middle line:90%
Remember those.

00:15:58.720 --> 00:16:03.640 align:middle line:10%
So in the alchemical process,
the first thing you do

00:16:03.640 --> 00:16:05.410 align:middle line:10%
is you collect
whatever you're going

00:16:05.410 --> 00:16:08.740 align:middle line:10%
to be working with by
its roots, the herb,

00:16:08.740 --> 00:16:12.970 align:middle line:10%
because there are oils that are
saved within the roots of that.

00:16:12.970 --> 00:16:18.380 align:middle line:84%
And you grind it up
into little bits.

00:16:18.380 --> 00:16:21.710 align:middle line:10%
And then you put it in a
vessel, and you put that vessel

00:16:21.710 --> 00:16:24.990 align:middle line:10%
into something that's
referred to as a sand bath.

00:16:24.990 --> 00:16:27.750 align:middle line:84%
And what it is, is just
a pot with sand in it.

00:16:27.750 --> 00:16:30.790 align:middle line:84%
And you heat it,
underneath the pot.

00:16:30.790 --> 00:16:33.810 align:middle line:84%
And what it does is
it causes the oils

00:16:33.810 --> 00:16:39.720 align:middle line:84%
to start to separate from
the herb into the liquid

00:16:39.720 --> 00:16:41.940 align:middle line:90%
through that heat.

00:16:41.940 --> 00:16:44.740 align:middle line:84%
Because it's in the sand, it
causes an equal distribution

00:16:44.740 --> 00:16:45.540 align:middle line:90%
of heat.

00:16:45.540 --> 00:16:48.770 align:middle line:90%
So it doesn't scorch the oils.

00:16:48.770 --> 00:16:51.540 align:middle line:84%
So this is the first stage
of the alchemical process

00:16:51.540 --> 00:16:53.210 align:middle line:90%
that was associated with water.

00:16:53.210 --> 00:16:55.560 align:middle line:10%
It was associated
with digestion.

00:16:55.560 --> 00:17:04.460 align:middle line:10%
This is a modern vessel in
the sand doing the same thing.

00:17:04.460 --> 00:17:08.135 align:middle line:10%
And here is an Egyptian
depiction of, of course,

00:17:08.135 --> 00:17:11.630 align:middle line:10%
the pieces of Osiris.

00:17:11.630 --> 00:17:15.030 align:middle line:10%
This is what it's depicting
as the digestion stage.

00:17:15.030 --> 00:17:17.390 align:middle line:10%
You grind it up, you put
it into different pieces,

00:17:17.390 --> 00:17:21.349 align:middle line:10%
put it in the vessel, and
you allow it to digest,

00:17:21.349 --> 00:17:23.480 align:middle line:10%
just like Osiris
was put in the Nile.

00:17:23.480 --> 00:17:27.750 align:middle line:84%
At first, your green herb
will start to turn brownish.

00:17:27.750 --> 00:17:35.590 align:middle line:10%
After further heat, the herb
at the bottom of the liquid

00:17:35.590 --> 00:17:37.820 align:middle line:10%
will start to turn black.

00:17:37.820 --> 00:17:41.090 align:middle line:10%
And once this has
happened, the Alchemist

00:17:41.090 --> 00:17:44.550 align:middle line:10%
knows that the first stage
of the process is done.

00:17:44.550 --> 00:17:48.900 align:middle line:84%
It's referred to as caput
mortem, which means dead head.

00:17:48.900 --> 00:17:51.865 align:middle line:84%
So this is the first stage
of the alchemical process.

00:17:51.865 --> 00:17:55.570 align:middle line:90%


00:17:55.570 --> 00:17:58.000 align:middle line:10%
With further heat
then, the liquid

00:17:58.000 --> 00:18:00.690 align:middle line:10%
itself starts to turn reddish.

00:18:00.690 --> 00:18:04.650 align:middle line:10%
So you still have the black
caput mortuum at the bottom,

00:18:04.650 --> 00:18:07.870 align:middle line:10%
but the liquid itself above
it will start to turn reddish.

00:18:07.870 --> 00:18:12.330 align:middle line:84%
And this is when they know the
first stage, the caput mortuum,

00:18:12.330 --> 00:18:17.280 align:middle line:84%
is done, because it
went from black to red.

00:18:17.280 --> 00:18:20.500 align:middle line:84%
Well, it went from
green to black to red.

00:18:20.500 --> 00:18:24.610 align:middle line:84%
So the next stage then
is, you take this liquid,

00:18:24.610 --> 00:18:26.590 align:middle line:90%
and you distill it.

00:18:26.590 --> 00:18:30.470 align:middle line:84%
So over here on the
left, here's the vessel.

00:18:30.470 --> 00:18:31.540 align:middle line:10%
It gets heated up.

00:18:31.540 --> 00:18:34.310 align:middle line:10%
That liquid turns into a steam.

00:18:34.310 --> 00:18:36.190 align:middle line:10%
It goes up to the
top, and then it

00:18:36.190 --> 00:18:39.760 align:middle line:10%
condenses down into
another liquid area where

00:18:39.760 --> 00:18:42.880 align:middle line:10%
it becomes white or clear-ish.

00:18:42.880 --> 00:18:48.730 align:middle line:84%
So we've gone from green
to black to red to white.

00:18:48.730 --> 00:18:52.090 align:middle line:84%
And the first with
the distillation.

00:18:52.090 --> 00:18:55.430 align:middle line:84%
This is an ancient
Athanor temple.

00:18:55.430 --> 00:18:59.740 align:middle line:10%
This is a depiction
from the 1600s.

00:18:59.740 --> 00:19:04.680 align:middle line:10%
You can see the alchemists
here praying at it.

00:19:04.680 --> 00:19:07.830 align:middle line:10%
And the same operation
would be done.

00:19:07.830 --> 00:19:10.970 align:middle line:84%
The vessel would be put
down here, be heated up.

00:19:10.970 --> 00:19:13.740 align:middle line:84%
Distillation will occur, and
it would be collected up here

00:19:13.740 --> 00:19:16.230 align:middle line:90%
at the top of the tower.

00:19:16.230 --> 00:19:20.160 align:middle line:84%
But he's praying because God is
always a part of the equation.

00:19:20.160 --> 00:19:23.610 align:middle line:84%
This is the difference between
chemistry and alchemistry.

00:19:23.610 --> 00:19:29.660 align:middle line:84%
In alchemy, the belief is that
god is a part of the process,

00:19:29.660 --> 00:19:32.300 align:middle line:84%
because it's all
happening within his mind.

00:19:32.300 --> 00:19:35.840 align:middle line:84%
So to bring about
true transformation,

00:19:35.840 --> 00:19:39.140 align:middle line:84%
there had to be a connection
between the alchemist

00:19:39.140 --> 00:19:41.990 align:middle line:84%
and that universal
consciousness that he was trying

00:19:41.990 --> 00:19:46.880 align:middle line:90%
to infuse into the process.

00:19:46.880 --> 00:19:51.360 align:middle line:90%
But here's another example.

00:19:51.360 --> 00:19:53.570 align:middle line:84%
Again, the vessel
would be heated up.

00:19:53.570 --> 00:19:56.060 align:middle line:84%
The liquid would fly
up here to the top,

00:19:56.060 --> 00:19:59.650 align:middle line:84%
and then it would go
down into a new vessel.

00:19:59.650 --> 00:20:04.120 align:middle line:84%
And here, this is an alchemical
diagram from Michael Maier from

00:20:04.120 --> 00:20:05.680 align:middle line:90%
the 1600s.

00:20:05.680 --> 00:20:07.850 align:middle line:84%
See the same thing
happening here.

00:20:07.850 --> 00:20:14.110 align:middle line:84%
But at the top of the athanor,
the tower, is an owl, a bird.

00:20:14.110 --> 00:20:17.740 align:middle line:84%
So the alchemists regularly
represented this distillation

00:20:17.740 --> 00:20:19.580 align:middle line:90%
process with birds.

00:20:19.580 --> 00:20:25.070 align:middle line:84%
And of course, in
the story of Osiris,

00:20:25.070 --> 00:20:26.550 align:middle line:90%
Osiris had been chopped up.

00:20:26.550 --> 00:20:29.210 align:middle line:84%
He'd been thrown into
the Nile, and then Isis

00:20:29.210 --> 00:20:36.400 align:middle line:84%
turns herself into a bird and
flies over him to reassemble him

00:20:36.400 --> 00:20:37.960 align:middle line:90%
in this new form.

00:20:37.960 --> 00:20:40.880 align:middle line:84%
This is representative
of distillation.

00:20:40.880 --> 00:20:43.630 align:middle line:90%


00:20:43.630 --> 00:20:46.300 align:middle line:10%
Finally, after you distilled
all the liquids out of it,

00:20:46.300 --> 00:20:50.110 align:middle line:10%
what you had at the bottom
of the flask was this--

00:20:50.110 --> 00:20:52.340 align:middle line:10%
or known as the bowels
of the experiment

00:20:52.340 --> 00:20:56.252 align:middle line:10%
or also the feces
of the experiment,

00:20:56.252 --> 00:20:59.650 align:middle line:10%
was this leftover remnant
of what the herb was.

00:20:59.650 --> 00:21:02.072 align:middle line:90%


00:21:02.072 --> 00:21:03.530 align:middle line:84%
Well, the alchemists
said then, you

00:21:03.530 --> 00:21:08.150 align:middle line:84%
had to take this, the bowels
or the feces, this bottom part,

00:21:08.150 --> 00:21:09.630 align:middle line:90%
and you had to burn it to ashes.

00:21:09.630 --> 00:21:12.560 align:middle line:84%
So here, this is from
an alchemical diagram

00:21:12.560 --> 00:21:14.670 align:middle line:90%
from Michael Maier from 1618.

00:21:14.670 --> 00:21:17.750 align:middle line:84%
You see a wolf eating the
bowels of the king, who

00:21:17.750 --> 00:21:19.202 align:middle line:90%
represented the herb.

00:21:19.202 --> 00:21:20.660 align:middle line:84%
And then in the
background, you see

00:21:20.660 --> 00:21:23.460 align:middle line:90%
the wolf being burnt to ashes.

00:21:23.460 --> 00:21:28.150 align:middle line:84%
So when you do this, at first,
you get a black charcoal.

00:21:28.150 --> 00:21:31.600 align:middle line:84%
And then with further heat,
you get a reddish ash.

00:21:31.600 --> 00:21:34.973 align:middle line:10%
Again, noticing these color
changes again, black, red.

00:21:34.973 --> 00:21:36.390 align:middle line:10%
What do you think
the next one is?

00:21:36.390 --> 00:21:37.370 align:middle line:10%
It's white.

00:21:37.370 --> 00:21:39.040 align:middle line:84%
What the alchemists
would then do

00:21:39.040 --> 00:21:41.650 align:middle line:84%
is they would take these
ashes, these reddish ashes,

00:21:41.650 --> 00:21:44.350 align:middle line:84%
and they would cook
them in an acid.

00:21:44.350 --> 00:21:48.850 align:middle line:84%
Now, the ancient
Egyptians, the acid

00:21:48.850 --> 00:21:51.220 align:middle line:84%
was the acid that
they were extracting

00:21:51.220 --> 00:21:54.520 align:middle line:84%
from the Dichapetalum,
that thorny plant

00:21:54.520 --> 00:21:57.100 align:middle line:84%
that you find growing
over by all the monuments

00:21:57.100 --> 00:21:59.470 align:middle line:90%
there in Egypt.

00:21:59.470 --> 00:22:05.410 align:middle line:84%
That acid was perfect
for cooking the ashes in,

00:22:05.410 --> 00:22:07.300 align:middle line:84%
because what it does
is it breaks down

00:22:07.300 --> 00:22:11.890 align:middle line:84%
the bonds, the carbon
bonds, of the ash,

00:22:11.890 --> 00:22:16.230 align:middle line:84%
and it liberates
out this white manna

00:22:16.230 --> 00:22:19.480 align:middle line:90%
that is contained within it.

00:22:19.480 --> 00:22:23.600 align:middle line:84%
So what happens is, first,
you cook it in the acid.

00:22:23.600 --> 00:22:25.920 align:middle line:10%
You filter it.

00:22:25.920 --> 00:22:28.140 align:middle line:10%
And then, through
a special process,

00:22:28.140 --> 00:22:33.180 align:middle line:10%
you're able to get the manna
to precipitate out of it,

00:22:33.180 --> 00:22:36.380 align:middle line:10%
which was the secret salt.

00:22:36.380 --> 00:22:38.890 align:middle line:84%
And then it settles
into the mound,

00:22:38.890 --> 00:22:42.080 align:middle line:84%
that same mound
shape that you find

00:22:42.080 --> 00:22:45.230 align:middle line:90%
on the Egyptian hieroglyphs.

00:22:45.230 --> 00:22:47.930 align:middle line:10%
And then after
you cleaned it, it

00:22:47.930 --> 00:22:50.750 align:middle line:10%
settles at the bottom
of the container.

00:22:50.750 --> 00:22:53.270 align:middle line:10%
Just clean it with
distilled water.

00:22:53.270 --> 00:22:57.170 align:middle line:10%
And then you can dry it
out, and you have cocaine.

00:22:57.170 --> 00:22:58.580 align:middle line:90%
Not really.

00:22:58.580 --> 00:22:59.990 align:middle line:90%
It's not cocaine, yeah.

00:22:59.990 --> 00:23:01.100 align:middle line:90%
You have this manna.

00:23:01.100 --> 00:23:03.260 align:middle line:84%
You're able to
extract this manna.

00:23:03.260 --> 00:23:06.680 align:middle line:84%
And what this manna is, is
it's-- we now know what it is,

00:23:06.680 --> 00:23:11.990 align:middle line:84%
is it's actually
monoatomic metals,

00:23:11.990 --> 00:23:14.640 align:middle line:84%
platinum metals in
a monoatomic state.

00:23:14.640 --> 00:23:18.540 align:middle line:84%
Most metals bind
with other things.

00:23:18.540 --> 00:23:21.140 align:middle line:90%


00:23:21.140 --> 00:23:23.400 align:middle line:84%
But what we have
here, it's actually--

00:23:23.400 --> 00:23:26.060 align:middle line:90%


00:23:26.060 --> 00:23:30.285 align:middle line:84%
each grain of this
powder is one atom.

00:23:30.285 --> 00:23:33.870 align:middle line:84%
And what happens is the outer
valence ring of the electron--

00:23:33.870 --> 00:23:35.700 align:middle line:84%
the outer valence
ring of the atom

00:23:35.700 --> 00:23:39.080 align:middle line:84%
becomes completely
captured by the nucleus.

00:23:39.080 --> 00:23:41.390 align:middle line:84%
It enters-- if you want
to get technical about it,

00:23:41.390 --> 00:23:45.830 align:middle line:84%
the two outer electrons
enter into what's

00:23:45.830 --> 00:23:48.320 align:middle line:84%
known as a Cooper
pair, which causes it

00:23:48.320 --> 00:23:50.330 align:middle line:90%
to go into a high-spin state.

00:23:50.330 --> 00:23:52.580 align:middle line:84%
And when that happens, it
becomes completely captured

00:23:52.580 --> 00:23:55.980 align:middle line:84%
by the nucleus of the atom and
it doesn't bind with anything.

00:23:55.980 --> 00:23:59.420 align:middle line:90%
And it takes on this new form.

00:23:59.420 --> 00:24:02.400 align:middle line:84%
It's white because it's
in a high-spin state.

00:24:02.400 --> 00:24:03.980 align:middle line:90%
The atom, it's spinning.

00:24:03.980 --> 00:24:06.110 align:middle line:84%
The electrons are
spinning so fast

00:24:06.110 --> 00:24:08.420 align:middle line:84%
that it just
refracts light, which

00:24:08.420 --> 00:24:11.820 align:middle line:90%
is why it appears as white.

00:24:11.820 --> 00:24:14.200 align:middle line:84%
This substance is
super conductive.

00:24:14.200 --> 00:24:19.680 align:middle line:84%
And two-- I'll just
mention two things about it

00:24:19.680 --> 00:24:20.660 align:middle line:90%
that are significant.

00:24:20.660 --> 00:24:23.880 align:middle line:90%
One is it seems to--

00:24:23.880 --> 00:24:27.650 align:middle line:84%
just like platinum metals
are used in chemotherapy,

00:24:27.650 --> 00:24:29.870 align:middle line:84%
but because they're in
a heavy metal state,

00:24:29.870 --> 00:24:34.500 align:middle line:84%
it poisons the body and
the person gets very sick.

00:24:34.500 --> 00:24:36.870 align:middle line:90%
But it can help kill the cancer.

00:24:36.870 --> 00:24:40.910 align:middle line:84%
Well, when platinum metals
are in a monoatomic state.

00:24:40.910 --> 00:24:42.590 align:middle line:84%
It's a totally
different nature and it

00:24:42.590 --> 00:24:44.310 align:middle line:90%
doesn't hurt the body at all.

00:24:44.310 --> 00:24:46.910 align:middle line:84%
In fact, it heals
the body without any

00:24:46.910 --> 00:24:48.210 align:middle line:90%
of those negative side effects.

00:24:48.210 --> 00:24:51.230 align:middle line:84%
And so the Mayo Clinic is
actually looking into this right

00:24:51.230 --> 00:24:53.470 align:middle line:90%
now.

00:24:53.470 --> 00:24:56.778 align:middle line:84%
So the Egyptians would
eat this for health,

00:24:56.778 --> 00:24:58.570 align:middle line:84%
and it was believed
that this was something

00:24:58.570 --> 00:25:04.570 align:middle line:84%
that they'd inherited, again,
from this Atlantean tradition.

00:25:04.570 --> 00:25:06.940 align:middle line:84%
The other property
of this substance

00:25:06.940 --> 00:25:10.570 align:middle line:84%
is, if you subject it to a weak
electrostatic field, which is

00:25:10.570 --> 00:25:14.800 align:middle line:90%
what the ark had, it causes--

00:25:14.800 --> 00:25:16.650 align:middle line:84%
if you are to have
a container filled

00:25:16.650 --> 00:25:21.330 align:middle line:84%
with this monoatomics, the same
container filled with nothing,

00:25:21.330 --> 00:25:23.460 align:middle line:84%
the container filled
with the monoatomics

00:25:23.460 --> 00:25:26.430 align:middle line:84%
will weigh less than the
container filled with nothing

00:25:26.430 --> 00:25:29.890 align:middle line:84%
when it's subjected to a
weak electrostatic field.

00:25:29.890 --> 00:25:32.800 align:middle line:90%
So there's levitation occurring.

00:25:32.800 --> 00:25:36.172 align:middle line:84%
And in fact, some people
believe even the ark--

00:25:36.172 --> 00:25:37.630 align:middle line:84%
if you remember,
even in the bible,

00:25:37.630 --> 00:25:40.990 align:middle line:84%
the ark was this
giant gold box that

00:25:40.990 --> 00:25:42.490 align:middle line:84%
would have weighed
a couple of tons,

00:25:42.490 --> 00:25:46.130 align:middle line:84%
and yet two people could
carry it with rods.

00:25:46.130 --> 00:25:48.160 align:middle line:90%
Well, that doesn't make sense.

00:25:48.160 --> 00:25:49.990 align:middle line:84%
Makes sense, though,
when you know

00:25:49.990 --> 00:25:57.080 align:middle line:84%
that there's manna in the ark
and it has these suggestions.

00:25:57.080 --> 00:26:00.140 align:middle line:84%
And of course, the people
that guarded the arks

00:26:00.140 --> 00:26:02.850 align:middle line:90%
were the Levites.

00:26:02.850 --> 00:26:05.640 align:middle line:84%
So some people
believe this is really

00:26:05.640 --> 00:26:10.260 align:middle line:84%
where the word levitation,
that word, comes from.

00:26:10.260 --> 00:26:15.610 align:middle line:84%
So anyhow, this white
powder was a big deal.

00:26:15.610 --> 00:26:19.090 align:middle line:84%
The last stage of the alchemical
process, according to tradition,

00:26:19.090 --> 00:26:24.250 align:middle line:84%
was that white powder could then
be put through another process,

00:26:24.250 --> 00:26:26.200 align:middle line:90%
and it would turn red.

00:26:26.200 --> 00:26:29.240 align:middle line:84%
And at that point, it became
known as the red lion.

00:26:29.240 --> 00:26:31.240 align:middle line:84%
And it was said to
have all of the healing

00:26:31.240 --> 00:26:37.420 align:middle line:84%
properties of the original
manna, the original monoatomics,

00:26:37.420 --> 00:26:40.210 align:middle line:84%
but it was brought
to another level.

00:26:40.210 --> 00:26:43.030 align:middle line:84%
So it actually
was super healing,

00:26:43.030 --> 00:26:48.060 align:middle line:84%
and it also raised
consciousness in the person.

00:26:48.060 --> 00:26:51.660 align:middle line:84%
And we find that in the
story of Osiris as well.

00:26:51.660 --> 00:26:56.040 align:middle line:84%
Sekhmet, the goddess
Sekhmet, the lioness,

00:26:56.040 --> 00:26:57.360 align:middle line:90%
she was known for healing.

00:26:57.360 --> 00:26:58.920 align:middle line:90%
She also known for war.

00:26:58.920 --> 00:27:01.240 align:middle line:84%
But one of the things she
was known was for healing,

00:27:01.240 --> 00:27:06.170 align:middle line:84%
but she was she worked
with Isis to raise Osiris.

00:27:06.170 --> 00:27:07.590 align:middle line:90%
And here we have--

00:27:07.590 --> 00:27:11.010 align:middle line:84%
this is actually from the
1300s-- an alchemical diagram.

00:27:11.010 --> 00:27:15.020 align:middle line:84%
You see this red lion
with wings because he's

00:27:15.020 --> 00:27:17.360 align:middle line:90%
raising the alchemist.

00:27:17.360 --> 00:27:20.470 align:middle line:84%
This is that state
of the red lion.

00:27:20.470 --> 00:27:21.950 align:middle line:90%
Again, all goes back to Egypt.

00:27:21.950 --> 00:27:26.150 align:middle line:84%
And this was something that the
Templars brought into Europe.

00:27:26.150 --> 00:27:30.190 align:middle line:84%
Now, we find this
not only-- and this

00:27:30.190 --> 00:27:34.000 align:middle line:84%
is where I'm going to kind
of wrap up and conclude.

00:27:34.000 --> 00:27:38.176 align:middle line:84%
This tradition, this
alchemical tradition,

00:27:38.176 --> 00:27:41.360 align:middle line:84%
that the Templars found
definitely within Egypt.

00:27:41.360 --> 00:27:43.400 align:middle line:84%
And it had been
passed down to groups

00:27:43.400 --> 00:27:48.530 align:middle line:84%
like the Sabians and the Druze
and the Sufi, these groups

00:27:48.530 --> 00:27:52.690 align:middle line:84%
in the Middle East that the
Templars established connections

00:27:52.690 --> 00:27:54.870 align:middle line:90%
with and learned from.

00:27:54.870 --> 00:27:59.580 align:middle line:84%
But it's also found
within Eastern traditions.

00:27:59.580 --> 00:28:04.460 align:middle line:84%
In fact, this is a
Tibetan mantra chant

00:28:04.460 --> 00:28:06.470 align:middle line:90%
of Om Mani Padme Hum.

00:28:06.470 --> 00:28:09.030 align:middle line:84%
You may have heard
of this before.

00:28:09.030 --> 00:28:12.260 align:middle line:90%
Om is the word of creation.

00:28:12.260 --> 00:28:18.760 align:middle line:84%
Mani is the precious stone
or the precious jewel.

00:28:18.760 --> 00:28:22.260 align:middle line:90%
The Mani is the manna.

00:28:22.260 --> 00:28:27.760 align:middle line:84%
Padme is the crown lotus
and Hum is completion.

00:28:27.760 --> 00:28:30.090 align:middle line:84%
So they're saying
through the word

00:28:30.090 --> 00:28:34.620 align:middle line:84%
and the precious white stone
and the opening of the lotus,

00:28:34.620 --> 00:28:37.320 align:middle line:84%
this is the completion
towards enlightenment,

00:28:37.320 --> 00:28:40.910 align:middle line:84%
or what in the Western
tradition we refer to as gnosis.

00:28:40.910 --> 00:28:46.940 align:middle line:90%


00:28:46.940 --> 00:28:51.230 align:middle line:84%
Just so we're clear, this
substance, this white substance,

00:28:51.230 --> 00:28:53.840 align:middle line:84%
is found all over
the ancient world,

00:28:53.840 --> 00:28:57.920 align:middle line:84%
and it's pretty much
known by the same name.

00:28:57.920 --> 00:29:03.650 align:middle line:10%
So in ancient Sumerian, for
example, the grail science,

00:29:03.650 --> 00:29:07.970 align:middle line:10%
or the alchemical science in
ancient Sumer was referred

00:29:07.970 --> 00:29:13.310 align:middle line:10%
to as GRA.AL, G-R-A-dot-A-L.
That was literally the name

00:29:13.310 --> 00:29:15.625 align:middle line:10%
of the alchemical
science in ancient Sumer.

00:29:15.625 --> 00:29:17.000 align:middle line:10%
And of course,
this is the origin

00:29:17.000 --> 00:29:21.020 align:middle line:10%
of the word grail, the Holy
Grail, which the Templars were

00:29:21.020 --> 00:29:22.500 align:middle line:10%
known for guarding.

00:29:22.500 --> 00:29:24.920 align:middle line:10%
But this grail science
in ancient Sumer

00:29:24.920 --> 00:29:28.770 align:middle line:10%
produced something that
was known as the Shemanna.

00:29:28.770 --> 00:29:31.320 align:middle line:84%
And the Shemanna was
not only a substance

00:29:31.320 --> 00:29:38.070 align:middle line:84%
that the gods, the Anunnaki,
used to extend their lives

00:29:38.070 --> 00:29:40.860 align:middle line:84%
and raise their consciousness,
but they also used it

00:29:40.860 --> 00:29:42.790 align:middle line:90%
in their flying vehicles.

00:29:42.790 --> 00:29:47.190 align:middle line:84%
Well, once you understand how
those monoatomics can produce

00:29:47.190 --> 00:29:48.900 align:middle line:84%
levitation, of
course, they would

00:29:48.900 --> 00:29:50.930 align:middle line:90%
use that in their vehicles.

00:29:50.930 --> 00:29:52.510 align:middle line:90%
So that's ancient Sumer.

00:29:52.510 --> 00:29:55.020 align:middle line:10%
In the Vedic tradition,
the alchemical science

00:29:55.020 --> 00:29:57.480 align:middle line:10%
was known as
Rasayana, and it was

00:29:57.480 --> 00:30:01.290 align:middle line:10%
used to produce something
known as Vimanna.

00:30:01.290 --> 00:30:04.980 align:middle line:84%
So instead of
Shemanna, it's Vimanna.

00:30:04.980 --> 00:30:06.460 align:middle line:90%
Same thing, though.

00:30:06.460 --> 00:30:11.100 align:middle line:90%
Same substance, same qualities.

00:30:11.100 --> 00:30:13.620 align:middle line:10%
In the Tibetan tradition,
it was known as Mani

00:30:13.620 --> 00:30:16.290 align:middle line:10%
or Cintamani, Chintamani.

00:30:16.290 --> 00:30:19.740 align:middle line:84%
The Polynesian tradition
referred to it as Mana.

00:30:19.740 --> 00:30:22.750 align:middle line:10%
Again, same substance.

00:30:22.750 --> 00:30:26.630 align:middle line:10%
The Hebrew, Christian
tradition called it Manna.

00:30:26.630 --> 00:30:28.610 align:middle line:10%
The Albigensian
Cathar tradition,

00:30:28.610 --> 00:30:30.110 align:middle line:10%
of which the
Templars came out of,

00:30:30.110 --> 00:30:33.600 align:middle line:10%
referred to it as Manni-sola.

00:30:33.600 --> 00:30:37.830 align:middle line:10%
And then in the Egyptian, it
was referred to as Gradal.

00:30:37.830 --> 00:30:43.320 align:middle line:10%
But that's what held the
Mfktz, or the white cake,

00:30:43.320 --> 00:30:46.170 align:middle line:10%
this white, gold
substance that's

00:30:46.170 --> 00:30:49.230 align:middle line:10%
found within the treasure
houses and was found within all

00:30:49.230 --> 00:30:52.560 align:middle line:10%
of those giant boxes.

00:30:52.560 --> 00:30:56.340 align:middle line:10%
So King Solomon, in the
midst of the "Kebra Nagast,"

00:30:56.340 --> 00:31:00.870 align:middle line:10%
he had a flying aerial carriage
that he would fly from Jerusalem

00:31:00.870 --> 00:31:03.310 align:middle line:10%
to Ethiopia in.

00:31:03.310 --> 00:31:05.560 align:middle line:84%
And it said-- the
text actually says

00:31:05.560 --> 00:31:09.380 align:middle line:84%
that he could fly
within a couple of hours

00:31:09.380 --> 00:31:14.450 align:middle line:84%
what would normally take people
several weeks to travel on foot.

00:31:14.450 --> 00:31:17.425 align:middle line:84%
But King Solomon, of
course, was also known for--

00:31:17.425 --> 00:31:20.390 align:middle line:90%


00:31:20.390 --> 00:31:22.820 align:middle line:84%
he built Solomon's
temple to hold the ark,

00:31:22.820 --> 00:31:25.820 align:middle line:84%
and the ark was created
to hold the manna.

00:31:25.820 --> 00:31:28.140 align:middle line:84%
So you have an idea of
what was going on there.

00:31:28.140 --> 00:31:32.440 align:middle line:84%
So all these things are
alluding to the same ideas.

00:31:32.440 --> 00:31:36.580 align:middle line:84%
Which means that they all
inherited this knowledge

00:31:36.580 --> 00:31:37.710 align:middle line:90%
from somewhere else.

00:31:37.710 --> 00:31:40.638 align:middle line:90%


00:31:40.638 --> 00:31:46.490 align:middle line:84%
Whether that be
UFOs or Atlanteans,

00:31:46.490 --> 00:31:48.940 align:middle line:84%
the point is, these
are different cultures

00:31:48.940 --> 00:31:51.800 align:middle line:84%
in different parts of
the world, and they

00:31:51.800 --> 00:31:56.000 align:middle line:84%
are talking about the exact same
thing, the exact same alchemical

00:31:56.000 --> 00:31:57.050 align:middle line:90%
science.

00:31:57.050 --> 00:32:01.010 align:middle line:84%
And this is part of what the
Templars sought out to find.

00:32:01.010 --> 00:32:04.360 align:middle line:90%
