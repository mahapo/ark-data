00:00:04.428 --> 00:00:07.872 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:07.872 --> 00:00:12.320 align:middle line:90%


00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:15.960 align:middle line:84%
>> So the big question comes
down to, how did they build

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:16.760 align:middle line:90%
these things?

00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:18.560 align:middle line:90%
How were they constructed?

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:23.240 align:middle line:10%
Well, I had this really,
really interesting journey

00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:27.470 align:middle line:10%
where I began looking
into different random,

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:30.830 align:middle line:10%
scattered parts of
history, mysterious things

00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:32.750 align:middle line:10%
that people don't
really understand.

00:00:32.750 --> 00:00:37.080 align:middle line:84%
And as I dug through those
mysteries across the world,

00:00:37.080 --> 00:00:39.140 align:middle line:84%
I came across a
story about something

00:00:39.140 --> 00:00:42.560 align:middle line:90%
called Solomon's Shamir.

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:45.950 align:middle line:84%
Has anybody heard of
that, Solomon's Shamir?

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:46.750 align:middle line:90%
We have one.

00:00:46.750 --> 00:00:47.560 align:middle line:90%
Amazing.

00:00:47.560 --> 00:00:51.940 align:middle line:10%
OK, so Solomon's
Shamir, often described

00:00:51.940 --> 00:00:59.110 align:middle line:10%
as some kind of worm that has a
green eye that shoots fire out

00:00:59.110 --> 00:01:00.670 align:middle line:10%
of it.

00:01:00.670 --> 00:01:04.510 align:middle line:84%
And this strange
worm had the power

00:01:04.510 --> 00:01:13.670 align:middle line:84%
to melt stone, move stones,
construct objects, and cut

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:19.950 align:middle line:84%
objects, a snaky thing
with a green light

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:22.940 align:middle line:90%
that comes out of it, huh?

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:26.730 align:middle line:84%
And I'm thinking that sounds
like the kind of thing that

00:01:26.730 --> 00:01:29.490 align:middle line:90%
could build these things, right?

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:31.680 align:middle line:90%
So then I'm in Dendera.

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:37.290 align:middle line:84%
And I go down underground,
and I'm like, oh, right.

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:40.110 align:middle line:90%
I forgot about this image.

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:42.770 align:middle line:90%
Look at this thing--

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:46.760 align:middle line:90%
two people holding this rod.

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:49.550 align:middle line:90%
And this rod is a djed.

00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:50.720 align:middle line:90%
We call it a djed.

00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:53.060 align:middle line:84%
It's got at least the
design of the djed.

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:57.200 align:middle line:10%
And it's got this thing
that they call the sun disk.

00:01:57.200 --> 00:02:00.860 align:middle line:10%
And it's got these two little
candle-like objects here

00:02:00.860 --> 00:02:04.830 align:middle line:10%
and these two larger
arc pieces here.

00:02:04.830 --> 00:02:11.330 align:middle line:10%
And this thing, if we look
at it really carefully,

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:14.060 align:middle line:10%
what do we find?

00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:15.020 align:middle line:90%
Here you go.

00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:18.290 align:middle line:84%
Here's your Tesla coil
and resistance system

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:22.340 align:middle line:84%
to protect electromagnetically,
two electrical diodes right

00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:24.530 align:middle line:90%
there to generate a plasma arc.

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:28.130 align:middle line:84%
And you've got amplifier
diodes and a channel

00:02:28.130 --> 00:02:31.070 align:middle line:90%
to focus that energy.

00:02:31.070 --> 00:02:34.730 align:middle line:84%
What if it was a big
freaking plasma gun?

00:02:34.730 --> 00:02:37.890 align:middle line:84%
And it could literally
chop through things.

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:41.000 align:middle line:84%
But it also had certain kind of
interesting resonant properties

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:43.550 align:middle line:84%
or, when combined with some
of the other technology,

00:02:43.550 --> 00:02:46.220 align:middle line:84%
could be used to
lift and move stones.

00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:50.126 align:middle line:84%
And then what are you going
to call something like that?

00:02:50.126 --> 00:02:55.370 align:middle line:84%
After the fall of
Atlantis, after the floods,

00:02:55.370 --> 00:02:58.490 align:middle line:84%
after all of these cycles
and time and civilization,

00:02:58.490 --> 00:03:01.100 align:middle line:84%
all you have is legends
of it and remnants of it

00:03:01.100 --> 00:03:02.780 align:middle line:90%
and the stories about it.

00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:04.250 align:middle line:90%
What is it going to become?

00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:07.640 align:middle line:84%
This strange
beastlike worm thing

00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:12.930 align:middle line:84%
that has the power to
shoot fire out of its eye.

00:03:12.930 --> 00:03:17.310 align:middle line:84%
But it's also described in a
way that's not just like a worm,

00:03:17.310 --> 00:03:20.310 align:middle line:84%
or it's like-- they also
use the word "substance,"

00:03:20.310 --> 00:03:22.410 align:middle line:90%
as a worm or a substance.

00:03:22.410 --> 00:03:25.660 align:middle line:84%
It's like a thing
that does this.

00:03:25.660 --> 00:03:28.590 align:middle line:84%
But they don't know how
to describe this thing.

00:03:28.590 --> 00:03:31.670 align:middle line:84%
And so I believe
that Solomon Shamir

00:03:31.670 --> 00:03:35.090 align:middle line:84%
is referring to one of the
plasma technologies that

00:03:35.090 --> 00:03:37.700 align:middle line:90%
was able to build the pyramids.

00:03:37.700 --> 00:03:40.460 align:middle line:84%
And all of the pyramids
exhibit this sort

00:03:40.460 --> 00:03:46.310 align:middle line:84%
of comprehensive
understanding of the sciences,

00:03:46.310 --> 00:03:52.010 align:middle line:84%
of the mathematics, but also
of deeper spiritual wisdom.

00:03:52.010 --> 00:03:55.700 align:middle line:84%
How many of you have ever been
through all three pyramids?

00:03:55.700 --> 00:03:56.570 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:03:56.570 --> 00:03:59.810 align:middle line:90%
So which one was your favorite?

00:03:59.810 --> 00:04:01.730 align:middle line:90%
>> The second one.

00:04:01.730 --> 00:04:03.110 align:middle line:90%
>> OK, nice.

00:04:03.110 --> 00:04:04.950 align:middle line:84%
The second one is your
favorite, amazing.

00:04:04.950 --> 00:04:06.630 align:middle line:90%
What about you?

00:04:06.630 --> 00:04:08.630 align:middle line:90%
[DISTANT SPEECH]

00:04:08.630 --> 00:04:10.630 align:middle line:90%
>> Uh-huh, uh-huh.

00:04:10.630 --> 00:04:12.250 align:middle line:90%
So the second one also.

00:04:12.250 --> 00:04:14.380 align:middle line:90%
Why?

00:04:14.380 --> 00:04:16.300 align:middle line:90%
[DISTANT SPEECH]

00:04:16.300 --> 00:04:20.230 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, yeah, each person
that I've asked that question

00:04:20.230 --> 00:04:24.460 align:middle line:84%
of tends to have a different
favorite and for different

00:04:24.460 --> 00:04:26.560 align:middle line:90%
reasons.

00:04:26.560 --> 00:04:29.620 align:middle line:84%
The Great Pyramid
is super activating.

00:04:29.620 --> 00:04:32.290 align:middle line:84%
But the second pyramid,
when you get it humming,

00:04:32.290 --> 00:04:34.870 align:middle line:84%
it's like portals
start to open up.

00:04:34.870 --> 00:04:35.890 align:middle line:90%
You know what I mean?

00:04:35.890 --> 00:04:37.223 align:middle line:90%
You know what I'm talking about?

00:04:37.223 --> 00:04:41.110 align:middle line:84%
It's like there's these gateways
that start to open in the field.

00:04:41.110 --> 00:04:44.380 align:middle line:84%
And you begin to see and
feel through these gateways

00:04:44.380 --> 00:04:47.620 align:middle line:90%
to lineages of information.

00:04:47.620 --> 00:04:49.810 align:middle line:84%
It's almost like it's
there to teach and inform

00:04:49.810 --> 00:04:52.390 align:middle line:84%
you and show you how we're
all part of a community.

00:04:52.390 --> 00:04:53.590 align:middle line:90%
We're all connected.

00:04:53.590 --> 00:04:56.350 align:middle line:84%
All of the roads
lead to the one.

00:04:56.350 --> 00:05:02.110 align:middle line:84%
Then the third pyramid, she's
like the little humble one.

00:05:02.110 --> 00:05:04.180 align:middle line:90%
Nobody ever talks about her.

00:05:04.180 --> 00:05:06.700 align:middle line:90%
But you go down into her.

00:05:06.700 --> 00:05:10.960 align:middle line:84%
And tell me if I'm
wrong, she lays you low.

00:05:10.960 --> 00:05:13.240 align:middle line:90%
She humbles you.

00:05:13.240 --> 00:05:17.270 align:middle line:10%
The energy in there
is so potent that it's

00:05:17.270 --> 00:05:21.260 align:middle line:10%
meant to basically say, OK,
we know now you're activated.

00:05:21.260 --> 00:05:23.700 align:middle line:84%
Now you're all
community connected.

00:05:23.700 --> 00:05:24.740 align:middle line:90%
Awesome, right?

00:05:24.740 --> 00:05:26.630 align:middle line:90%
Now you're ready to be God.

00:05:26.630 --> 00:05:30.240 align:middle line:90%
No, get on your knees.

00:05:30.240 --> 00:05:32.560 align:middle line:90%
Bow down.

00:05:32.560 --> 00:05:37.210 align:middle line:84%
If you cannot become humble
when you become powerful,

00:05:37.210 --> 00:05:41.350 align:middle line:84%
then you have lost the meaning
of gaining power at all.

00:05:41.350 --> 00:05:44.080 align:middle line:84%
If you cannot surrender
your strength,

00:05:44.080 --> 00:05:45.790 align:middle line:90%
then you have no strength.

00:05:45.790 --> 00:05:47.530 align:middle line:90%
[APPLAUSE]

00:05:47.530 --> 00:05:49.540 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:05:49.540 --> 00:05:51.980 align:middle line:10%
Thank you.

00:05:51.980 --> 00:05:54.820 align:middle line:10%
And so through
the three pyramids

00:05:54.820 --> 00:05:57.010 align:middle line:10%
and through this
experience with them,

00:05:57.010 --> 00:06:00.850 align:middle line:10%
I came to a sense
of understanding

00:06:00.850 --> 00:06:05.090 align:middle line:10%
that this is not just machines.

00:06:05.090 --> 00:06:06.280 align:middle line:90%
These are not just engines.

00:06:06.280 --> 00:06:08.080 align:middle line:90%
It's not just about energy.

00:06:08.080 --> 00:06:11.260 align:middle line:84%
It's about comprehensive,
integrative, unified

00:06:11.260 --> 00:06:13.900 align:middle line:84%
technologies, a level
of understanding

00:06:13.900 --> 00:06:16.600 align:middle line:84%
about both technology
and spirituality

00:06:16.600 --> 00:06:19.990 align:middle line:84%
that we just don't really
have here on Earth, do we?

00:06:19.990 --> 00:06:22.180 align:middle line:10%
And interestingly,
the more people

00:06:22.180 --> 00:06:26.380 align:middle line:10%
that I started coming across
who had memories and experiences

00:06:26.380 --> 00:06:31.510 align:middle line:10%
from the stars and other
worlds, almost all of them that

00:06:31.510 --> 00:06:34.450 align:middle line:10%
have this deep resonance
with this place

00:06:34.450 --> 00:06:38.500 align:middle line:10%
called Arcturus, which is the
name of a star, by the way.

00:06:38.500 --> 00:06:42.430 align:middle line:84%
But the Arcturus star has
this system around it,

00:06:42.430 --> 00:06:45.700 align:middle line:84%
believed to be by those who
are the experiencers of this.

00:06:45.700 --> 00:06:49.900 align:middle line:10%
And they all say, well, we
feel like we helped build

00:06:49.900 --> 00:06:55.930 align:middle line:10%
the pyramids in Egypt, and
that our world has pyramids,

00:06:55.930 --> 00:07:00.370 align:middle line:10%
and that our world is a
lot about initiations,

00:07:00.370 --> 00:07:04.330 align:middle line:10%
usually through the dark,
by going into the darkness

00:07:04.330 --> 00:07:09.750 align:middle line:10%
to find the light, to face
the shadow, to meet the truth.

00:07:09.750 --> 00:07:13.950 align:middle line:10%
And the Arcturians that I've
spoken with and worked with

00:07:13.950 --> 00:07:15.960 align:middle line:10%
and gone deeper and
deeper with helped

00:07:15.960 --> 00:07:19.770 align:middle line:10%
me to understand that a
lot of the mathematics,

00:07:19.770 --> 00:07:23.110 align:middle line:10%
the advanced thinking, the
advancements that are there

00:07:23.110 --> 00:07:26.790 align:middle line:10%
and that we find across Egypt,
that many of those advancements

00:07:26.790 --> 00:07:32.440 align:middle line:10%
are the keystones of the
Arcturian civilization.

00:07:32.440 --> 00:07:35.850 align:middle line:84%
And this is where my
talk takes a left turn

00:07:35.850 --> 00:07:41.040 align:middle line:84%
because I start to help you
guys understand and will start

00:07:41.040 --> 00:07:46.380 align:middle line:84%
to show you that these sites,
this mathematics, this geometry,

00:07:46.380 --> 00:07:51.010 align:middle line:84%
this magic, it's not just about
the sites on the ground, first

00:07:51.010 --> 00:07:51.810 align:middle line:90%
of all.

00:07:51.810 --> 00:07:56.160 align:middle line:84%
And it's not just about the
ancient history of Earth.

00:07:56.160 --> 00:07:59.460 align:middle line:84%
It's also about
the ancient history

00:07:59.460 --> 00:08:03.840 align:middle line:84%
of our community in the
stars and our connection

00:08:03.840 --> 00:08:07.590 align:middle line:84%
to that community and the
role that those communities

00:08:07.590 --> 00:08:10.690 align:middle line:90%
have had in our development.

00:08:10.690 --> 00:08:15.460 align:middle line:84%
Where else now do we find the
level of advanced mathematics

00:08:15.460 --> 00:08:19.300 align:middle line:84%
and integrative understanding
impressed into objects randomly

00:08:19.300 --> 00:08:22.900 align:middle line:90%
and suddenly on the Earth?

00:08:22.900 --> 00:08:25.510 align:middle line:90%
Crop circles.

00:08:25.510 --> 00:08:27.640 align:middle line:84%
Now, did John and
Jill actually go

00:08:27.640 --> 00:08:30.850 align:middle line:84%
and build this thing
in two hours overnight?

00:08:30.850 --> 00:08:32.799 align:middle line:84%
Look at the size
of a person there.

00:08:32.799 --> 00:08:36.049 align:middle line:90%


00:08:36.049 --> 00:08:38.990 align:middle line:84%
Are all the farmers that have
seen lights show up at night

00:08:38.990 --> 00:08:41.720 align:middle line:84%
flashing across their fields
and then disappearing?

00:08:41.720 --> 00:08:44.000 align:middle line:90%
Are they all crazy?

00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:46.310 align:middle line:84%
Do we have helicopters
with advanced cymatics

00:08:46.310 --> 00:08:50.250 align:middle line:84%
and just some really crazy rock
star military guys who are like,

00:08:50.250 --> 00:08:54.260 align:middle line:84%
dude, let's put the Fibonacci
sequence into a divine pattern

00:08:54.260 --> 00:08:56.630 align:middle line:90%
on that dude's lawn, man?

00:08:56.630 --> 00:08:59.750 align:middle line:90%
It's like, no.

00:08:59.750 --> 00:09:03.680 align:middle line:84%
And when you start to unpack
the geometry in these things,

00:09:03.680 --> 00:09:08.330 align:middle line:84%
you take this one Euler's cube
is what I like to call it,

00:09:08.330 --> 00:09:11.690 align:middle line:90%
put it in Fosbury in 2010.

00:09:11.690 --> 00:09:14.690 align:middle line:84%
Just the proportions
between each

00:09:14.690 --> 00:09:19.460 align:middle line:84%
of the lines in the structure
reveal pi alpha divided by 100,

00:09:19.460 --> 00:09:22.610 align:middle line:84%
Euler-Mascheroni square
root of 2, square root of 3,

00:09:22.610 --> 00:09:25.760 align:middle line:84%
square root of 5,
cube root of 2.

00:09:25.760 --> 00:09:28.610 align:middle line:84%
And I was really obsessing all
this stuff because Robert Grant,

00:09:28.610 --> 00:09:31.050 align:middle line:84%
I was working with him building
a new encryption system.

00:09:31.050 --> 00:09:33.770 align:middle line:84%
And I swear, every day Robert
would come into the office,

00:09:33.770 --> 00:09:36.890 align:middle line:84%
and he's like, I decoded
another da Vinci painting.

00:09:36.890 --> 00:09:40.670 align:middle line:84%
And it's got the cube root of
2 and the square root of 4.

00:09:40.670 --> 00:09:43.358 align:middle line:84%
And you're like, whoa,
OK, cool, Robert.

00:09:43.358 --> 00:09:45.150 align:middle line:84%
And then the next day,
it's the same thing.

00:09:45.150 --> 00:09:46.890 align:middle line:10%
And the next day,
the same thing.

00:09:46.890 --> 00:09:49.380 align:middle line:84%
And eventually, you're
like, wow, I should probably

00:09:49.380 --> 00:09:52.560 align:middle line:84%
start absorbing that and
learning from that, I guess.

00:09:52.560 --> 00:09:54.870 align:middle line:84%
And what you find
is that, yeah, you

00:09:54.870 --> 00:09:58.680 align:middle line:84%
take the tracks that roll
through the structure,

00:09:58.680 --> 00:10:01.200 align:middle line:90%
the tractor tracks.

00:10:01.200 --> 00:10:03.120 align:middle line:90%
That equals 1.

00:10:03.120 --> 00:10:05.785 align:middle line:84%
That becomes your
baseline for measurement.

00:10:05.785 --> 00:10:08.160 align:middle line:84%
And then you do all the other
measurements based on that.

00:10:08.160 --> 00:10:09.540 align:middle line:10%
And boom, all of
a sudden, you've

00:10:09.540 --> 00:10:14.410 align:middle line:10%
got the codes of the universe
stuck in a freaking crop circle.

00:10:14.410 --> 00:10:16.870 align:middle line:84%
Now, maybe they're
trying to tell us

00:10:16.870 --> 00:10:18.970 align:middle line:84%
some stuff with
these crop circles.

00:10:18.970 --> 00:10:21.190 align:middle line:84%
Maybe they're
trying to remind us

00:10:21.190 --> 00:10:24.610 align:middle line:84%
of some things that
can help us unpack some

00:10:24.610 --> 00:10:26.820 align:middle line:90%
of these ancient mysteries.

00:10:26.820 --> 00:10:29.010 align:middle line:84%
And when we look
at these things,

00:10:29.010 --> 00:10:30.850 align:middle line:84%
you start to wonder,
wow, actually,

00:10:30.850 --> 00:10:33.540 align:middle line:84%
this looks like a
molecular structure.

00:10:33.540 --> 00:10:36.822 align:middle line:84%
When I was decrypting this
one, I didn't say anything.

00:10:36.822 --> 00:10:39.030 align:middle line:84%
I just put the picture in
front of my friend Carissa,

00:10:39.030 --> 00:10:43.260 align:middle line:84%
who is my operations
director of my company.

00:10:43.260 --> 00:10:47.580 align:middle line:10%
And she worked with the
Nanotechnology Research

00:10:47.580 --> 00:10:49.420 align:middle line:10%
Institute of Canada
for many years.

00:10:49.420 --> 00:10:50.220 align:middle line:90%
She still does.

00:10:50.220 --> 00:10:53.700 align:middle line:84%
We're actually synthesizing
some materials there,

00:10:53.700 --> 00:10:56.970 align:middle line:84%
hoping to get them synthesized
in this next grant cycle

00:10:56.970 --> 00:10:59.700 align:middle line:84%
over the next year, that
we believe is actually

00:10:59.700 --> 00:11:01.410 align:middle line:84%
a crystalline
structure that can have

00:11:01.410 --> 00:11:04.320 align:middle line:84%
the same piezoelectric
properties that we see in some

00:11:04.320 --> 00:11:08.910 align:middle line:84%
of these ancient devices and be
useful for localized easy energy

00:11:08.910 --> 00:11:11.800 align:middle line:84%
production based on the quantum
vacuum fluctuations of space

00:11:11.800 --> 00:11:12.600 align:middle line:90%
time.

00:11:12.600 --> 00:11:15.700 align:middle line:90%
But that's part of another talk.

00:11:15.700 --> 00:11:20.790 align:middle line:84%
So looks like a molecular
structure, right?

00:11:20.790 --> 00:11:23.700 align:middle line:84%
Let's get down to what
these things actually are.

00:11:23.700 --> 00:11:25.050 align:middle line:90%
What are these stones?

00:11:25.050 --> 00:11:26.130 align:middle line:90%
What's in them?

00:11:26.130 --> 00:11:27.520 align:middle line:90%
What is the matter of it?

00:11:27.520 --> 00:11:28.960 align:middle line:90%
What is the physics of it?

00:11:28.960 --> 00:11:31.030 align:middle line:84%
We do need to talk a
little physics here

00:11:31.030 --> 00:11:34.720 align:middle line:84%
because in order to
understand this technology,

00:11:34.720 --> 00:11:37.660 align:middle line:84%
you need to understand
the physics.

00:11:37.660 --> 00:11:42.130 align:middle line:84%
Well, I've been studying
the proton for a long time.

00:11:42.130 --> 00:11:46.970 align:middle line:84%
And a lot of my initial work,
when I was in high school,

00:11:46.970 --> 00:11:48.970 align:middle line:84%
I did my senior
project in high school

00:11:48.970 --> 00:11:52.240 align:middle line:84%
called the unification of
science and spirituality

00:11:52.240 --> 00:11:55.012 align:middle line:84%
through unified
field theoretics.

00:11:55.012 --> 00:11:56.620 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:11:56.620 --> 00:11:58.495 align:middle line:90%
Yes, I was that geeky.

00:11:58.495 --> 00:12:02.070 align:middle line:90%


00:12:02.070 --> 00:12:06.080 align:middle line:84%
But I did that because
I woke up when I was 15.

00:12:06.080 --> 00:12:07.980 align:middle line:84%
And I realized I
had an energy body.

00:12:07.980 --> 00:12:11.180 align:middle line:84%
And before that, I was
the shyest kid, barely

00:12:11.180 --> 00:12:12.230 align:middle line:90%
had any friends.

00:12:12.230 --> 00:12:16.070 align:middle line:84%
I'd go home, play on the
computer, learn how to hack,

00:12:16.070 --> 00:12:18.200 align:middle line:84%
learn how to turn on
and off phone lines,

00:12:18.200 --> 00:12:19.700 align:middle line:90%
learn how to pick locks.

00:12:19.700 --> 00:12:20.990 align:middle line:90%
I wanted ninja skills.

00:12:20.990 --> 00:12:22.040 align:middle line:90%
You know what I mean?

00:12:22.040 --> 00:12:24.230 align:middle line:90%
15-year-old, ninja skills.

00:12:24.230 --> 00:12:26.600 align:middle line:84%
I'll pick my teacher's
lock and get the thing out.

00:12:26.600 --> 00:12:28.610 align:middle line:84%
And boom, and
everybody's like, yay.

00:12:28.610 --> 00:12:30.000 align:middle line:90%
It was awesome.

00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:32.450 align:middle line:10%
But then I woke up,
and I discovered

00:12:32.450 --> 00:12:33.570 align:middle line:10%
I had this energy body.

00:12:33.570 --> 00:12:36.290 align:middle line:84%
And I needed to know,
how is it possible

00:12:36.290 --> 00:12:38.750 align:middle line:84%
that I can move chi
between my hands,

00:12:38.750 --> 00:12:43.040 align:middle line:84%
stick it out over anybody else's
hand, and they can feel the chi?

00:12:43.040 --> 00:12:46.490 align:middle line:84%
And yet no one in school, no
one in the academic world,

00:12:46.490 --> 00:12:48.620 align:middle line:84%
no scientist is
talking about it.

00:12:48.620 --> 00:12:51.090 align:middle line:90%
Give me a break.

00:12:51.090 --> 00:12:54.390 align:middle line:84%
And this led me down this
long rabbit hole pipeline

00:12:54.390 --> 00:12:56.850 align:middle line:84%
where I started to look
at and understand, what

00:12:56.850 --> 00:12:58.920 align:middle line:90%
is the geometry of this field?

00:12:58.920 --> 00:12:59.920 align:middle line:90%
What is this?

00:12:59.920 --> 00:13:01.890 align:middle line:90%
What is spacetime?

00:13:01.890 --> 00:13:04.950 align:middle line:84%
And the deeper I dug,
the clearer it became.

00:13:04.950 --> 00:13:09.270 align:middle line:10%
Spacetime is this incredible
holographic light lattice

00:13:09.270 --> 00:13:11.520 align:middle line:10%
that has a particular geometry.

00:13:11.520 --> 00:13:13.830 align:middle line:10%
It's tetrahedral
and triangulated.

00:13:13.830 --> 00:13:16.410 align:middle line:10%
But it also has
to curve in order

00:13:16.410 --> 00:13:19.800 align:middle line:10%
to form gravity because
spacetime curvature makes

00:13:19.800 --> 00:13:20.640 align:middle line:10%
gravity.

00:13:20.640 --> 00:13:23.970 align:middle line:10%
And so spacetime curvature
then also makes mass.

00:13:23.970 --> 00:13:27.570 align:middle line:10%
And so how do you curve
an equilateral lattice

00:13:27.570 --> 00:13:30.000 align:middle line:10%
into a sphere?

00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:31.560 align:middle line:10%
A geodesic.

00:13:31.560 --> 00:13:35.610 align:middle line:10%
And geodesics are the great
work of Buckminster Fuller.

00:13:35.610 --> 00:13:37.830 align:middle line:10%
Anybody here know
Buckminster Fuller's work?

00:13:37.830 --> 00:13:39.100 align:middle line:90%
Yes, awesome.

00:13:39.100 --> 00:13:39.900 align:middle line:90%
Great.

00:13:39.900 --> 00:13:41.490 align:middle line:90%
Then you've got a great primer.

00:13:41.490 --> 00:13:46.830 align:middle line:84%
And once you curve spacetime
into this sphere structure, what

00:13:46.830 --> 00:13:48.660 align:middle line:84%
you're literally talking
about is spacetime

00:13:48.660 --> 00:13:51.610 align:middle line:84%
that's so highly curved
that the way that we

00:13:51.610 --> 00:13:54.520 align:middle line:84%
would think about that
in astronomical terms

00:13:54.520 --> 00:13:55.960 align:middle line:90%
is a black hole.

00:13:55.960 --> 00:13:57.760 align:middle line:90%
It's too sharply curved.

00:13:57.760 --> 00:13:59.600 align:middle line:90%
It has way too much gravity.

00:13:59.600 --> 00:14:01.682 align:middle line:84%
And this is why physicists
are like, no way,

00:14:01.682 --> 00:14:03.640 align:middle line:84%
proton can't be a black
hole because if it was,

00:14:03.640 --> 00:14:06.040 align:middle line:84%
it would just suck up
all the other protons.

00:14:06.040 --> 00:14:08.690 align:middle line:90%
But here's the trick.

00:14:08.690 --> 00:14:10.780 align:middle line:84%
If the proton is spinning
at the speed of light

00:14:10.780 --> 00:14:14.680 align:middle line:84%
around its equator, then it's
going to shear space time.

00:14:14.680 --> 00:14:16.720 align:middle line:84%
And through that
shearing of spacetime,

00:14:16.720 --> 00:14:20.140 align:middle line:84%
it's going to operate as though
it's actually quite light, even

00:14:20.140 --> 00:14:21.910 align:middle line:90%
though it's extremely heavy.

00:14:21.910 --> 00:14:24.190 align:middle line:84%
So the first
starships we actually

00:14:24.190 --> 00:14:27.580 align:middle line:84%
know about here on Earth
that we have accessible to us

00:14:27.580 --> 00:14:29.260 align:middle line:84%
are actually the
protons floating around

00:14:29.260 --> 00:14:30.760 align:middle line:90%
in all your bodies.

00:14:30.760 --> 00:14:32.950 align:middle line:90%
But it goes way deeper.

00:14:32.950 --> 00:14:37.420 align:middle line:84%
Because when you start looking
at this pentagonal geometry--

00:14:37.420 --> 00:14:41.020 align:middle line:84%
by the way, pentagon,
pentagram, sacred symbolism

00:14:41.020 --> 00:14:44.260 align:middle line:84%
of all the Earth religions,
going way, way back in time.

00:14:44.260 --> 00:14:48.040 align:middle line:84%
I wonder why they thought, God,
expressing through the physical,

00:14:48.040 --> 00:14:49.720 align:middle line:90%
used this geometry.

00:14:49.720 --> 00:14:50.560 align:middle line:90%
Interesting.

00:14:50.560 --> 00:14:52.490 align:middle line:90%
It's how you get physicality.

00:14:52.490 --> 00:14:54.350 align:middle line:90%
It's how you get matter.

00:14:54.350 --> 00:14:56.360 align:middle line:84%
And you know what the
word "matter" comes from?

00:14:56.360 --> 00:15:03.310 align:middle line:84%
Matere, mather, mather,
mother, the goddess

00:15:03.310 --> 00:15:06.700 align:middle line:84%
And if you look at this
pattern in the proton--

00:15:06.700 --> 00:15:09.730 align:middle line:84%
and by the way, this is just
a geometric representation.

00:15:09.730 --> 00:15:11.710 align:middle line:84%
The proton is
actually much bigger

00:15:11.710 --> 00:15:16.820 align:middle line:84%
than this, with much higher
frequency dome, insanely higher.

00:15:16.820 --> 00:15:18.263 align:middle line:90%
And these are pipelines.

00:15:18.263 --> 00:15:19.930 align:middle line:84%
So this is at a certain
stage before you

00:15:19.930 --> 00:15:21.500 align:middle line:90%
get to the core of the proton.

00:15:21.500 --> 00:15:23.830 align:middle line:84%
So you follow the
lines all the way down,

00:15:23.830 --> 00:15:25.820 align:middle line:84%
and you look at
the structure here.

00:15:25.820 --> 00:15:28.660 align:middle line:84%
What you end up with at
the very core of the proton

00:15:28.660 --> 00:15:31.870 align:middle line:84%
is something called an
excavated dodecahedron.

00:15:31.870 --> 00:15:33.880 align:middle line:84%
And it turns out
that if you stack

00:15:33.880 --> 00:15:36.460 align:middle line:84%
the layers of that excavated
dodecahedron and you

00:15:36.460 --> 00:15:39.940 align:middle line:84%
pipeline that out through
these five-pointed lattice

00:15:39.940 --> 00:15:43.420 align:middle line:84%
arrays coming out of
the core of the proton

00:15:43.420 --> 00:15:47.620 align:middle line:84%
and you look at that
array from the top down,

00:15:47.620 --> 00:15:51.430 align:middle line:84%
guess what the geometry of those
pipes, going into the proton,

00:15:51.430 --> 00:15:54.200 align:middle line:90%
matches?

00:15:54.200 --> 00:15:55.470 align:middle line:90%
DNA.

00:15:55.470 --> 00:15:56.660 align:middle line:90%
So you have these inputs.

00:15:56.660 --> 00:15:58.160 align:middle line:10%
You've got these outputs.

00:15:58.160 --> 00:16:02.660 align:middle line:10%
And the whole structure of how
the energy could move in and out

00:16:02.660 --> 00:16:05.600 align:middle line:10%
through these tunneling
patterns, quantum

00:16:05.600 --> 00:16:10.370 align:middle line:10%
tunnels in the proton is
literally the same structure

00:16:10.370 --> 00:16:12.620 align:middle line:10%
as DNA from the top down.

00:16:12.620 --> 00:16:16.500 align:middle line:84%
And then I'm like, OK, well,
maybe there's a connection here.

00:16:16.500 --> 00:16:19.760 align:middle line:84%
Maybe there's some kind
of storage happening.

00:16:19.760 --> 00:16:22.490 align:middle line:84%
Maybe protons are
storing information.

00:16:22.490 --> 00:16:27.800 align:middle line:10%
And so what I did is I take
the number of oscillations

00:16:27.800 --> 00:16:31.790 align:middle line:10%
in the entire proton,
the whole proton's

00:16:31.790 --> 00:16:35.450 align:middle line:10%
quantum bits, so to speak.

00:16:35.450 --> 00:16:37.910 align:middle line:10%
Spacetime, as we come
to understand it now

00:16:37.910 --> 00:16:39.830 align:middle line:10%
in advanced
theoretical physics, is

00:16:39.830 --> 00:16:45.470 align:middle line:10%
that the structure, if discrete,
is each made of a Planck unit.

00:16:45.470 --> 00:16:48.860 align:middle line:10%
And each of those
Planck units is a state.

00:16:48.860 --> 00:16:51.590 align:middle line:10%
And that state is like
a bit of information,

00:16:51.590 --> 00:16:53.450 align:middle line:10%
just like a bit
inside of a computer.

00:16:53.450 --> 00:16:55.890 align:middle line:10%
And you get a group of
bits, you get a byte.

00:16:55.890 --> 00:17:00.060 align:middle line:10%
And so all of our computers
and stuff that we've built,

00:17:00.060 --> 00:17:02.440 align:middle line:10%
we've built off of this concept.

00:17:02.440 --> 00:17:05.099 align:middle line:10%
And if you look at
a proton, proton

00:17:05.099 --> 00:17:10.790 align:middle line:10%
is full of basically 10 to the
60th of these quantum bits.

00:17:10.790 --> 00:17:14.829 align:middle line:10%
So that's the number of
Planck oscillations inside

00:17:14.829 --> 00:17:17.700 align:middle line:10%
of the volume of one proton.

00:17:17.700 --> 00:17:21.150 align:middle line:10%
But then I was looking
and doing some other work

00:17:21.150 --> 00:17:23.220 align:middle line:10%
on the age of the
universe because I thought

00:17:23.220 --> 00:17:26.040 align:middle line:10%
it was really fascinating
that the number of seconds

00:17:26.040 --> 00:17:31.800 align:middle line:10%
in the estimated age of the
universe is basically 4.32 times

00:17:31.800 --> 00:17:34.360 align:middle line:10%
10 to the 17th.

00:17:34.360 --> 00:17:36.250 align:middle line:90%
That's really interesting.

00:17:36.250 --> 00:17:38.980 align:middle line:84%
If you guys heard of
4.32, how many of you

00:17:38.980 --> 00:17:42.607 align:middle line:84%
out there have heard of 4.32 is
an interesting powerful number

00:17:42.607 --> 00:17:45.190 align:middle line:84%
having to do with resonance and
all of these different things?

00:17:45.190 --> 00:17:46.670 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, well, I won't
gloss over it.

00:17:46.670 --> 00:17:48.378 align:middle line:84%
I'll show you a little
bit more about it.

00:17:48.378 --> 00:17:52.360 align:middle line:84%
But then I decided, well, how
many seconds of Planck time?

00:17:52.360 --> 00:17:54.160 align:middle line:84%
In other words,
you divide a second

00:17:54.160 --> 00:17:58.480 align:middle line:84%
into Planck seconds, which is
a smaller unit of time that's

00:17:58.480 --> 00:18:00.670 align:middle line:84%
relevant to other
Planck units, which

00:18:00.670 --> 00:18:02.698 align:middle line:90%
are used in quantum mechanics.

00:18:02.698 --> 00:18:04.240 align:middle line:84%
Like I said, a little
physics lesson.

00:18:04.240 --> 00:18:06.350 align:middle line:84%
I promise I won't
stay here too long.

00:18:06.350 --> 00:18:08.170 align:middle line:84%
And it turns out
that the estimated

00:18:08.170 --> 00:18:10.630 align:middle line:84%
age of the universe
in Planck seconds

00:18:10.630 --> 00:18:15.240 align:middle line:90%
is 8.77 times 10 to the 60th.

00:18:15.240 --> 00:18:18.990 align:middle line:84%
So the number of Planck
seconds in the age

00:18:18.990 --> 00:18:23.700 align:middle line:84%
of the entire universe
matches roughly the amount

00:18:23.700 --> 00:18:27.620 align:middle line:84%
of oscillating bits
inside of every proton?

00:18:27.620 --> 00:18:30.850 align:middle line:90%


00:18:30.850 --> 00:18:34.170 align:middle line:90%
Think about that for a second.

00:18:34.170 --> 00:18:37.320 align:middle line:84%
10 to the 60th is a
huge number, by the way.

00:18:37.320 --> 00:18:41.130 align:middle line:84%
I mean, this could
easily be 10 to the 61st.

00:18:41.130 --> 00:18:45.370 align:middle line:84%
Or what if the proton
had 10 to the 48th?

00:18:45.370 --> 00:18:48.550 align:middle line:90%
No, 10 to the 60th.

00:18:48.550 --> 00:18:50.640 align:middle line:90%
It nailed it.

00:18:50.640 --> 00:18:54.940 align:middle line:84%
And what that means to me as a
physicist, that's not a mistake.

00:18:54.940 --> 00:18:56.100 align:middle line:90%
That's not a coincidence.

00:18:56.100 --> 00:18:59.340 align:middle line:84%
What it means is that
every proton is actually

00:18:59.340 --> 00:19:03.780 align:middle line:84%
the hard drive storing the
information of its experience

00:19:03.780 --> 00:19:07.260 align:middle line:84%
from the beginning of
the universe to now.

00:19:07.260 --> 00:19:09.840 align:middle line:84%
Do you want to know where
the Akashic Record is?

00:19:09.840 --> 00:19:11.340 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:19:11.340 --> 00:19:12.360 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:19:12.360 --> 00:19:13.703 align:middle line:90%
It's a big freaking deal.

00:19:13.703 --> 00:19:15.120 align:middle line:84%
You want to know
where the Akashic

00:19:15.120 --> 00:19:19.950 align:middle line:90%
Record is, it's right here.

00:19:19.950 --> 00:19:23.250 align:middle line:90%
Your body is the memory.

00:19:23.250 --> 00:19:24.960 align:middle line:90%
This is all memory.

00:19:24.960 --> 00:19:26.220 align:middle line:90%
It's all remembering.

00:19:26.220 --> 00:19:29.130 align:middle line:84%
And yeah, let's not gloss over
that day, because it's also

00:19:29.130 --> 00:19:33.390 align:middle line:84%
not a coincidence that it's
4.32 times 10 to the 17th

00:19:33.390 --> 00:19:36.190 align:middle line:84%
that we are right now
having this conversation.

00:19:36.190 --> 00:19:39.165 align:middle line:84%
Because if we look
at it, then 4.32--

00:19:39.165 --> 00:19:42.300 align:middle line:84%
4.32, as a number,
that also happens

00:19:42.300 --> 00:19:45.810 align:middle line:90%
to be the moon's orbital speed.

00:19:45.810 --> 00:19:49.980 align:middle line:84%
It happens to be ratios of the
equatorial diameter in miles

00:19:49.980 --> 00:19:50.940 align:middle line:90%
of the sun.

00:19:50.940 --> 00:19:54.300 align:middle line:10%
It happens to be the Earth's
circumference in nautical miles.

00:19:54.300 --> 00:19:57.570 align:middle line:10%
It happens to be the
number of seconds in a day.

00:19:57.570 --> 00:19:59.370 align:middle line:84%
And it goes on and
on and on and on.

00:19:59.370 --> 00:20:01.320 align:middle line:90%
The list goes on and on.

00:20:01.320 --> 00:20:07.080 align:middle line:84%
So there's some serious
magic in this realization

00:20:07.080 --> 00:20:10.410 align:middle line:84%
that we're in right now
and the way the universe is

00:20:10.410 --> 00:20:14.160 align:middle line:84%
and where we're at as a
juncture point in consciousness

00:20:14.160 --> 00:20:16.980 align:middle line:90%
on this planet and at this time.

00:20:16.980 --> 00:20:19.450 align:middle line:10%
And when you start to
go a little deeper,

00:20:19.450 --> 00:20:21.280 align:middle line:10%
I want you to
understand that when

00:20:21.280 --> 00:20:23.740 align:middle line:10%
I say protons are hard
drives, this is not just

00:20:23.740 --> 00:20:26.640 align:middle line:10%
a guess out of the blue.

00:20:26.640 --> 00:20:29.280 align:middle line:84%
We are already using
quantum computing

00:20:29.280 --> 00:20:33.900 align:middle line:84%
to store information
based on simply the spin

00:20:33.900 --> 00:20:38.550 align:middle line:84%
state of each one of the
atoms inside of a molecule

00:20:38.550 --> 00:20:44.070 align:middle line:84%
or a series of molecules inside
of a larger set or a lattice.

00:20:44.070 --> 00:20:47.220 align:middle line:84%
And the way we're doing most
of the quantum computing

00:20:47.220 --> 00:20:48.163 align:middle line:90%
is just spin state.

00:20:48.163 --> 00:20:49.830 align:middle line:84%
So we just say, is
it spinning this way?

00:20:49.830 --> 00:20:51.100 align:middle line:90%
Or is it spinning that way?

00:20:51.100 --> 00:20:53.790 align:middle line:84%
Which is roughly
a 1 or a 0 thing.

00:20:53.790 --> 00:20:55.960 align:middle line:84%
That's still the
way we're thinking.

00:20:55.960 --> 00:20:58.800 align:middle line:84%
But in a proton,
you could store 10

00:20:58.800 --> 00:21:01.650 align:middle line:90%
to the 60th bits of information.

00:21:01.650 --> 00:21:05.350 align:middle line:84%
That's more than all of the
computers on Earth combined.

00:21:05.350 --> 00:21:08.070 align:middle line:84%
In fact, that's so
much information.

00:21:08.070 --> 00:21:10.710 align:middle line:84%
I'm about to blow your socks off
with how much information that

00:21:10.710 --> 00:21:12.340 align:middle line:90%
is in just a minute.

00:21:12.340 --> 00:21:15.920 align:middle line:90%
So hold onto your socks.

00:21:15.920 --> 00:21:19.010 align:middle line:84%
And there's this whole concept
that's come into the physics

00:21:19.010 --> 00:21:21.680 align:middle line:84%
world more recently, thanks
to guys like John Wheeler,

00:21:21.680 --> 00:21:26.090 align:middle line:84%
that suggest that when Einstein
and Rosen were talking about

00:21:26.090 --> 00:21:27.920 align:middle line:90%
Einstein-Rosen bridges--

00:21:27.920 --> 00:21:30.620 align:middle line:84%
you heard of that
term, wormholes?

00:21:30.620 --> 00:21:33.110 align:middle line:84%
Wormhole connects two
points in spacetime.

00:21:33.110 --> 00:21:35.480 align:middle line:84%
Theoretically, you
could have wormholes

00:21:35.480 --> 00:21:40.400 align:middle line:84%
linking star systems, a portal
between two points in space.

00:21:40.400 --> 00:21:43.070 align:middle line:84%
But it would take
huge amounts of energy

00:21:43.070 --> 00:21:45.830 align:middle line:84%
that we don't have apparently,
oh, except for that spacetime

00:21:45.830 --> 00:21:48.560 align:middle line:90%
is full of that energy already.

00:21:48.560 --> 00:21:51.020 align:middle line:10%
That's called the
vacuum catastrophe.

00:21:51.020 --> 00:21:53.450 align:middle line:10%
Energy is full of space.

00:21:53.450 --> 00:21:55.230 align:middle line:90%
Space is full of energy.

00:21:55.230 --> 00:21:59.270 align:middle line:84%
And it turns out that Einstein,
Podolsky, and Rosen were also

00:21:59.270 --> 00:22:03.020 align:middle line:84%
doing this other paper that's
about entanglement, spooky

00:22:03.020 --> 00:22:04.830 align:middle line:90%
action at a distance.

00:22:04.830 --> 00:22:06.780 align:middle line:84%
And now the
physicists are going,

00:22:06.780 --> 00:22:12.500 align:middle line:84%
wait, maybe entanglement
between two points in space

00:22:12.500 --> 00:22:15.480 align:middle line:84%
is actually just
a microwormhole.

00:22:15.480 --> 00:22:18.000 align:middle line:90%
It's exactly the same concept.

00:22:18.000 --> 00:22:21.030 align:middle line:84%
Somehow there could be
a portal-like threading

00:22:21.030 --> 00:22:22.630 align:middle line:90%
that exists between things.

00:22:22.630 --> 00:22:24.420 align:middle line:84%
And it got to the
point where Wheeler

00:22:24.420 --> 00:22:26.378 align:middle line:84%
looking at it and his
buddies-- and by the way,

00:22:26.378 --> 00:22:29.070 align:middle line:84%
John Wheeler is the guy who
wrote the book on gravitation.

00:22:29.070 --> 00:22:31.470 align:middle line:84%
It's the biggest book you
get in college physics.

00:22:31.470 --> 00:22:32.670 align:middle line:90%
It's like boom.

00:22:32.670 --> 00:22:35.603 align:middle line:84%
It's on your desk, and you think
your desk is going to break.

00:22:35.603 --> 00:22:37.020 align:middle line:84%
You've got to carry
that to class.

00:22:37.020 --> 00:22:41.910 align:middle line:84%
And you're like, OK, I've got
to go learn about gravity, guys.

00:22:41.910 --> 00:22:42.900 align:middle line:90%
Excuse me for a second.

00:22:42.900 --> 00:22:45.620 align:middle line:90%


00:22:45.620 --> 00:22:49.070 align:middle line:84%
Well, maybe, as they
are looking at this,

00:22:49.070 --> 00:22:55.020 align:middle line:84%
maybe the whole universe is
full of microwormhole networks.

00:22:55.020 --> 00:22:56.690 align:middle line:90%
That's what Wheeler suggested.

00:22:56.690 --> 00:23:00.350 align:middle line:84%
And that the entanglement
between any phenomena

00:23:00.350 --> 00:23:03.260 align:middle line:84%
is actually a
microwormhole network.

00:23:03.260 --> 00:23:05.600 align:middle line:10%
So I just started
wondering, if we

00:23:05.600 --> 00:23:10.400 align:middle line:10%
take the proton as a universal
hard drive of some kind,

00:23:10.400 --> 00:23:14.780 align:middle line:10%
you've got these as hard drives,
how many network connections

00:23:14.780 --> 00:23:16.550 align:middle line:10%
can this hard drive make?

00:23:16.550 --> 00:23:21.340 align:middle line:10%
The answer is 10 to the 40th.

00:23:21.340 --> 00:23:26.850 align:middle line:84%
That's a one with
40 zeros after it.

00:23:26.850 --> 00:23:28.140 align:middle line:90%
Interesting.

00:23:28.140 --> 00:23:35.820 align:middle line:84%
So then I'm like, well, how many
connections can I make then?

00:23:35.820 --> 00:23:39.690 align:middle line:84%
If we take the number
of atoms in my body,

00:23:39.690 --> 00:23:44.460 align:middle line:84%
around 6.5 octillion, we
take the number of protons

00:23:44.460 --> 00:23:48.540 align:middle line:84%
in those atoms in my
body, 10 to the 28th,

00:23:48.540 --> 00:23:52.530 align:middle line:84%
and we take the number of
wormhole connections per proton

00:23:52.530 --> 00:23:56.040 align:middle line:84%
that are possible and
the number of Planck time

00:23:56.040 --> 00:24:00.090 align:middle line:84%
units in a single second,
and we decided to calculate,

00:24:00.090 --> 00:24:04.890 align:middle line:84%
in one second, how
networked can I be?

00:24:04.890 --> 00:24:07.500 align:middle line:84%
How much network
connection can I

00:24:07.500 --> 00:24:11.100 align:middle line:84%
produce with this freaking
awesome bodysuit thing

00:24:11.100 --> 00:24:14.520 align:middle line:84%
that I have going on
in this incarnation?

00:24:14.520 --> 00:24:16.800 align:middle line:84%
the answer, my
friends, basically,

00:24:16.800 --> 00:24:19.440 align:middle line:84%
if you account for
potential errors

00:24:19.440 --> 00:24:22.950 align:middle line:84%
and possibly no connections
around the equator

00:24:22.950 --> 00:24:27.740 align:middle line:84%
what, you essentially get
is around 10 to the 111th.

00:24:27.740 --> 00:24:32.390 align:middle line:84%
Now, you guys know
about computers, right,

00:24:32.390 --> 00:24:34.460 align:middle line:90%
because we all have computers.

00:24:34.460 --> 00:24:38.630 align:middle line:84%
So the basics in computing,
when you use the internet,

00:24:38.630 --> 00:24:41.420 align:middle line:84%
you got your gigabytes per
second if you're lucky.

00:24:41.420 --> 00:24:43.310 align:middle line:84%
It's like, yeah, I
got my gig speed.

00:24:43.310 --> 00:24:44.960 align:middle line:90%
Awesome.

00:24:44.960 --> 00:24:50.140 align:middle line:84%
The fastest computer
networks on the planet

00:24:50.140 --> 00:24:56.330 align:middle line:84%
provide about 26,000
megabytes per second.

00:24:56.330 --> 00:24:58.400 align:middle line:84%
That's about the fastest
we've ever gotten,

00:24:58.400 --> 00:25:02.370 align:middle line:84%
the most data per
second in a pipeline.

00:25:02.370 --> 00:25:08.540 align:middle line:84%
This is 1 trillion, trillion,
trillion, trillion, trillion,

00:25:08.540 --> 00:25:11.540 align:middle line:84%
trillion, trillion, trillion,
trillion, trillion, trillion,

00:25:11.540 --> 00:25:13.295 align:middle line:90%
trillion, megabytes per second.

00:25:13.295 --> 00:25:21.150 align:middle line:90%


00:25:21.150 --> 00:25:22.810 align:middle line:90%
That's pretty fast.

00:25:22.810 --> 00:25:24.580 align:middle line:90%
That's a lot.

00:25:24.580 --> 00:25:29.380 align:middle line:84%
And the total number of data
bits that the body can produce,

00:25:29.380 --> 00:25:32.450 align:middle line:84%
if we look at that
and we say, well,

00:25:32.450 --> 00:25:36.250 align:middle line:84%
what if I want to entangle
with the whole universe then?

00:25:36.250 --> 00:25:38.270 align:middle line:90%
can I do it.

00:25:38.270 --> 00:25:42.310 align:middle line:84%
Well, it turns out that if
you take the number of stars

00:25:42.310 --> 00:25:45.880 align:middle line:84%
in the entire universe-- let's
say you want to connect to every

00:25:45.880 --> 00:25:49.940 align:middle line:90%
star in the whole universe--

00:25:49.940 --> 00:25:53.060 align:middle line:90%
that's only 10 to the 24th.

00:25:53.060 --> 00:25:58.460 align:middle line:84%
That means you could connect
every proton in your body

00:25:58.460 --> 00:26:01.760 align:middle line:84%
to different star in
the entire universe.

00:26:01.760 --> 00:26:05.510 align:middle line:84%
And you're only going
to use 1 out of 10

00:26:05.510 --> 00:26:08.180 align:middle line:90%
to the 61ths of your bandwidth.

00:26:08.180 --> 00:26:11.330 align:middle line:84%
I mean, that's such
a small number.

00:26:11.330 --> 00:26:13.040 align:middle line:84%
I like to make the
joke of like, you

00:26:13.040 --> 00:26:16.820 align:middle line:84%
could connect with all the stars
in the universe in the size

00:26:16.820 --> 00:26:19.700 align:middle line:90%
of the tip of your pinky.

00:26:19.700 --> 00:26:21.290 align:middle line:90%
That's how powerful it is.

00:26:21.290 --> 00:26:23.820 align:middle line:90%


00:26:23.820 --> 00:26:24.990 align:middle line:90%
Remember Willow?

00:26:24.990 --> 00:26:27.030 align:middle line:84%
(IMITATING WILLOW) The
power of the universe.

00:26:27.030 --> 00:26:30.690 align:middle line:84%
Willow, it was my
own finger, right?

00:26:30.690 --> 00:26:31.900 align:middle line:90%
It's right here.

00:26:31.900 --> 00:26:34.050 align:middle line:84%
Which one contains the
power of the universe?

00:26:34.050 --> 00:26:36.930 align:middle line:84%
You contain the power
of the universe.

00:26:36.930 --> 00:26:40.170 align:middle line:84%
You can entangle to the
entire freaking thing.

00:26:40.170 --> 00:26:43.680 align:middle line:84%
You already are built with
the information pipelines

00:26:43.680 --> 00:26:48.400 align:middle line:84%
to experience yourself
as the universe.

00:26:48.400 --> 00:26:49.960 align:middle line:90%
Whoa, right?

00:26:49.960 --> 00:26:54.250 align:middle line:84%
So when you've had those
moments, those God realization

00:26:54.250 --> 00:26:59.740 align:middle line:84%
moments that that moment of,
oh my god, I am everything,

00:26:59.740 --> 00:27:02.290 align:middle line:84%
it's because you
actually already

00:27:02.290 --> 00:27:04.660 align:middle line:84%
have the network
connections to do that.

00:27:04.660 --> 00:27:08.170 align:middle line:84%
You can literally
experience it, cellularly,

00:27:08.170 --> 00:27:12.650 align:middle line:84%
physically in your body,
that data exchange.

00:27:12.650 --> 00:27:17.080 align:middle line:84%
And now if you start to
really think about this

00:27:17.080 --> 00:27:19.660 align:middle line:84%
and you start to look
at, well, what is memory?

00:27:19.660 --> 00:27:21.100 align:middle line:90%
What is our experience?

00:27:21.100 --> 00:27:22.180 align:middle line:90%
What is time?

00:27:22.180 --> 00:27:23.800 align:middle line:90%
What is all of this stuff?

00:27:23.800 --> 00:27:27.340 align:middle line:10%
what you start to see is that
as I'm journeying through time,

00:27:27.340 --> 00:27:30.430 align:middle line:10%
I'm basically exchanging
and entangling

00:27:30.430 --> 00:27:33.400 align:middle line:10%
with the people, the places,
the things, the handshakes,

00:27:33.400 --> 00:27:35.986 align:middle line:10%
the moments, the da, the
da, the da, the da, the da,

00:27:35.986 --> 00:27:39.610 align:middle line:10%
every one of those is
an information exchange

00:27:39.610 --> 00:27:43.180 align:middle line:10%
and an entanglement, just
a little bit, a little one.

00:27:43.180 --> 00:27:45.310 align:middle line:84%
But the little ones
add up and add up

00:27:45.310 --> 00:27:47.360 align:middle line:84%
and add up and
add up and add up.

00:27:47.360 --> 00:27:50.020 align:middle line:84%
And so throughout
your whole life,

00:27:50.020 --> 00:27:52.960 align:middle line:84%
you've had all of these
journeys of entangling

00:27:52.960 --> 00:27:54.640 align:middle line:84%
to all of these
different things and all

00:27:54.640 --> 00:27:56.210 align:middle line:90%
of these different places.

00:27:56.210 --> 00:27:58.780 align:middle line:84%
And what is your
brain trying to do?

00:27:58.780 --> 00:28:02.510 align:middle line:84%
Your brain is not generating
the consciousness.

00:28:02.510 --> 00:28:07.190 align:middle line:84%
Your brain is just scrambling
to map all of it out.

00:28:07.190 --> 00:28:11.000 align:middle line:84%
The brain is trying to create
neurological structures,

00:28:11.000 --> 00:28:16.910 align:middle line:84%
larger biological memory
systems to map the information

00:28:16.910 --> 00:28:21.140 align:middle line:84%
exchange that you're having
through your entanglements.

00:28:21.140 --> 00:28:22.890 align:middle line:90%
Does that make sense?

00:28:22.890 --> 00:28:23.690 align:middle line:90%
Are you getting me?

00:28:23.690 --> 00:28:27.530 align:middle line:84%
So we're basically building
biological structures

00:28:27.530 --> 00:28:33.710 align:middle line:84%
to create the holograms
inside of our wet suit

00:28:33.710 --> 00:28:36.980 align:middle line:84%
to be able to match
the information data

00:28:36.980 --> 00:28:39.950 align:middle line:84%
exchange that we're having
with the universe all the time.

00:28:39.950 --> 00:28:43.050 align:middle line:84%
But the brain doesn't always
catch all of it, does it?

00:28:43.050 --> 00:28:47.750 align:middle line:84%
But this is also why we can
access the memory anyway.

00:28:47.750 --> 00:28:51.230 align:middle line:84%
We can actually bypass whatever
the brain's wetware has

00:28:51.230 --> 00:28:55.250 align:middle line:84%
assembled if we simply tap into
the information network that's

00:28:55.250 --> 00:28:59.330 align:middle line:84%
already inside our bodies
and all the memory that's

00:28:59.330 --> 00:29:02.270 align:middle line:84%
held through the cellular
networks and the protons

00:29:02.270 --> 00:29:05.650 align:middle line:84%
in all those cells
throughout our whole system.

00:29:05.650 --> 00:29:09.100 align:middle line:84%
We've got access to
so much more than just

00:29:09.100 --> 00:29:10.580 align:middle line:90%
what the brain can provide.

00:29:10.580 --> 00:29:14.170 align:middle line:84%
And we're barely using
our brain to its use.

00:29:14.170 --> 00:29:17.520 align:middle line:90%
