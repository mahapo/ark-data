00:00:11.770 --> 00:00:14.800 align:middle line:84%
>> In states of great
love and inspiration,

00:00:14.800 --> 00:00:18.520 align:middle line:84%
the Egyptians taught a window
opens within and a light from

00:00:18.520 --> 00:00:20.840 align:middle line:90%
a higher reality can shine in.

00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:25.120 align:middle line:84%
This is the whole magic or
the game of transfiguration,

00:00:25.120 --> 00:00:27.590 align:middle line:84%
that it's really a
matter of the heart.

00:00:27.590 --> 00:00:30.620 align:middle line:10%
We think of transfiguration
as a mental concept--

00:00:30.620 --> 00:00:32.229 align:middle line:10%
I'm going to change my form.

00:00:32.229 --> 00:00:36.490 align:middle line:10%
But really, it's about tapping
the power, the unlimited power

00:00:36.490 --> 00:00:37.550 align:middle line:10%
of the heart.

00:00:37.550 --> 00:00:41.410 align:middle line:84%
It's about tapping the
power of love, a cosmic love

00:00:41.410 --> 00:00:45.790 align:middle line:84%
beyond love that we sometimes
can't even contemplate or even

00:00:45.790 --> 00:00:48.170 align:middle line:84%
imagine in our
earthly existence.

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:50.810 align:middle line:84%
Think of the love
you have for a pet.

00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:54.050 align:middle line:84%
Think of the love you have
for a child, a spouse.

00:00:54.050 --> 00:00:56.290 align:middle line:10%
Multiply it by a million.

00:00:56.290 --> 00:00:57.880 align:middle line:10%
That's the kind
of love that we're

00:00:57.880 --> 00:01:01.870 align:middle line:10%
talking about that these higher
states can bring into our life.

00:01:01.870 --> 00:01:04.840 align:middle line:10%
And think about the
transformative power

00:01:04.840 --> 00:01:08.440 align:middle line:10%
of such a vibration
in our world.

00:01:08.440 --> 00:01:13.085 align:middle line:10%
I've been asked to keep my
remarks today to precisely

00:01:13.085 --> 00:01:15.460 align:middle line:10%
at 11:00 AM because there's
going to be a mass meditation

00:01:15.460 --> 00:01:18.820 align:middle line:10%
in this room that is focused
on some of the things that

00:01:18.820 --> 00:01:20.630 align:middle line:10%
I'm talking about right here.

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:25.690 align:middle line:10%
And I really believe that is
the pathway forward for us.

00:01:25.690 --> 00:01:29.170 align:middle line:10%
We have not even tried
it yet as a species--

00:01:29.170 --> 00:01:33.800 align:middle line:10%
a collective heart opening,
a collective transfiguration.

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:37.120 align:middle line:10%
But yet, that is what we're
all actually involved in,

00:01:37.120 --> 00:01:40.570 align:middle line:10%
is opening a window
into our consciousness,

00:01:40.570 --> 00:01:46.240 align:middle line:10%
into our cosmos that will
provide new ideas, inspirations,

00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:50.530 align:middle line:10%
and answers that will completely
and utterly transfigure

00:01:50.530 --> 00:01:52.190 align:middle line:10%
and transform our world.

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:55.390 align:middle line:10%
The Bible speaks of this
happening in a flash,

00:01:55.390 --> 00:01:57.670 align:middle line:10%
in a twinkling of an eye.

00:01:57.670 --> 00:02:02.090 align:middle line:10%
And, again, the idea is that
it happens just like that.

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:04.192 align:middle line:84%
And part of what's
involved here,

00:02:04.192 --> 00:02:05.650 align:middle line:84%
according to the
ancient Egyptians,

00:02:05.650 --> 00:02:09.009 align:middle line:90%
is a divine food, a plant.

00:02:09.009 --> 00:02:12.010 align:middle line:90%
There are, again, tones, lights.

00:02:12.010 --> 00:02:15.500 align:middle line:10%
There are images as well,
such as this image here

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:19.340 align:middle line:10%
of King Tut from
one of his shrines,

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:23.990 align:middle line:10%
where we see a star up
in the top of the image.

00:02:23.990 --> 00:02:26.400 align:middle line:10%
We see three rays
extending from the star

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:29.300 align:middle line:10%
and it's going right into
King Tut's third eye,

00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:30.480 align:middle line:10%
his pineal gland.

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:32.370 align:middle line:10%
It's activating
his consciousness.

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:34.410 align:middle line:84%
And look at the expression
on King Tut's face.

00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:35.900 align:middle line:90%
He's looking at you going--

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:36.920 align:middle line:90%
get it?

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:38.070 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:02:38.070 --> 00:02:39.990 align:middle line:90%
Get this star power.

00:02:39.990 --> 00:02:41.290 align:middle line:90%
Open up that window.

00:02:41.290 --> 00:02:43.260 align:middle line:84%
Open your heart,
open the window.

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:46.290 align:middle line:84%
Let's let this higher
light into our world

00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:49.810 align:middle line:84%
right now because it will
transfigure everything.

00:02:49.810 --> 00:02:54.720 align:middle line:84%
But even more beyond that, this
is the promise of this process,

00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:56.400 align:middle line:90%
according to the Egyptians.

00:02:56.400 --> 00:03:00.420 align:middle line:10%
In addition to the star, we
see the Egyptian hieroglyph

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:01.720 align:middle line:10%
for walking.

00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:03.340 align:middle line:10%
You see the two feet.

00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:06.630 align:middle line:10%
Dr. Charles Muses has put
these two images together

00:03:06.630 --> 00:03:10.260 align:middle line:10%
and said that this indicates
Tutankhamen opening a window,

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:13.020 align:middle line:10%
allowing a higher
light in so that now he

00:03:13.020 --> 00:03:15.450 align:middle line:10%
can become a star walker.

00:03:15.450 --> 00:03:18.215 align:middle line:10%
So that's really
quite profound to me

00:03:18.215 --> 00:03:19.590 align:middle line:10%
because the way
I would interpret

00:03:19.590 --> 00:03:22.410 align:middle line:10%
that is that it would
say that, yes, he's

00:03:22.410 --> 00:03:26.280 align:middle line:10%
going into the stars
as a star walker,

00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:30.120 align:middle line:10%
but he's also walking the
Earth as a star walker.

00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:33.120 align:middle line:10%
And that's a big
transformational concept

00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:34.120 align:middle line:10%
for humanity.

00:03:34.120 --> 00:03:37.870 align:middle line:10%
If we fully embody this
idea that we are star stuff,

00:03:37.870 --> 00:03:41.680 align:middle line:10%
that we came from other realms
on a particular mission.

00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:44.830 align:middle line:10%
And we walk on this
planet as star walkers

00:03:44.830 --> 00:03:47.830 align:middle line:10%
knowing that we are here to
fulfill that mission, that

00:03:47.830 --> 00:03:50.380 align:middle line:10%
gives us a greater
sense of purpose,

00:03:50.380 --> 00:03:53.710 align:middle line:10%
and perhaps even a greater
sense of urgency as well,

00:03:53.710 --> 00:03:55.550 align:middle line:10%
especially at this moment.

00:03:55.550 --> 00:03:59.140 align:middle line:10%
Because personally, I believe
that metaphysically speaking,

00:03:59.140 --> 00:04:02.950 align:middle line:10%
you and I all chose to
be here at this moment

00:04:02.950 --> 00:04:07.370 align:middle line:10%
for exactly what is happening
in our world at this moment.

00:04:07.370 --> 00:04:09.917 align:middle line:84%
And you and I are
the game changers.

00:04:09.917 --> 00:04:11.500 align:middle line:84%
We're the ones who
aren't going to get

00:04:11.500 --> 00:04:15.890 align:middle line:84%
stuck into all the material
and manipulative aspect of it.

00:04:15.890 --> 00:04:17.452 align:middle line:84%
We're reaching for
that higher light.

00:04:17.452 --> 00:04:18.910 align:middle line:84%
We're bringing the
higher light in.

00:04:18.910 --> 00:04:21.459 align:middle line:84%
Trying to bathe
ourselves and our planet,

00:04:21.459 --> 00:04:24.500 align:middle line:84%
baptize ourselves and our
planet with this higher light.

00:04:24.500 --> 00:04:28.610 align:middle line:10%
And this will be the remedy
that will transfigure our world.

00:04:28.610 --> 00:04:29.720 align:middle line:10%
That's our goal.

00:04:29.720 --> 00:04:31.260 align:middle line:10%
Amen?

00:04:31.260 --> 00:04:32.250 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:04:32.250 --> 00:04:33.790 align:middle line:90%
Glad we're on the same page.

00:04:33.790 --> 00:04:35.320 align:middle line:90%
Make sure.

00:04:35.320 --> 00:04:42.100 align:middle line:84%
So when I had that visionary
experience with Isis or Hathor,

00:04:42.100 --> 00:04:44.500 align:middle line:84%
she was talking
about these images

00:04:44.500 --> 00:04:46.690 align:middle line:84%
that I'm going to show
you now for a moment.

00:04:46.690 --> 00:04:50.170 align:middle line:84%
When she said your work in
Egypt with these star boats is

00:04:50.170 --> 00:04:53.520 align:middle line:84%
beautiful, she's referring to,
in particular, this image here.

00:04:53.520 --> 00:04:56.990 align:middle line:90%
This is a Ptolemaic king.

00:04:56.990 --> 00:04:58.780 align:middle line:84%
The Ptolemies were
the successors

00:04:58.780 --> 00:05:00.170 align:middle line:90%
of Alexander the Great.

00:05:00.170 --> 00:05:01.810 align:middle line:90%
This is 300 BC.

00:05:01.810 --> 00:05:03.530 align:middle line:90%
Alexander's conquered the world.

00:05:03.530 --> 00:05:05.720 align:middle line:84%
He's like you and I,
he's a researcher.

00:05:05.720 --> 00:05:06.860 align:middle line:90%
He's an initiate.

00:05:06.860 --> 00:05:10.130 align:middle line:84%
He went to Egypt, took all
the pharaonic initiations.

00:05:10.130 --> 00:05:13.450 align:middle line:10%
The successors of Alexander
built the Great Library

00:05:13.450 --> 00:05:14.390 align:middle line:10%
of Alexandria.

00:05:14.390 --> 00:05:16.810 align:middle line:10%
They rebuilt many of
the ancient temples,

00:05:16.810 --> 00:05:18.670 align:middle line:10%
including the Temple
of Hathor at Dendera,

00:05:18.670 --> 00:05:20.660 align:middle line:10%
where this image is found.

00:05:20.660 --> 00:05:23.280 align:middle line:84%
This is one of his successors,
one of his generals.

00:05:23.280 --> 00:05:27.700 align:middle line:84%
This is a human being who's on
the Ark of the Millions of Years

00:05:27.700 --> 00:05:29.880 align:middle line:90%
traveling towards Orion.

00:05:29.880 --> 00:05:33.670 align:middle line:10%
He is done what you and I
are in the process of doing,

00:05:33.670 --> 00:05:37.580 align:middle line:10%
which is to complete our
earthly cycle of incarnation.

00:05:37.580 --> 00:05:39.270 align:middle line:90%
He's hit the books.

00:05:39.270 --> 00:05:40.800 align:middle line:90%
He's done all the work.

00:05:40.800 --> 00:05:43.408 align:middle line:10%
Now he's on his ship
of eternity, the Ark

00:05:43.408 --> 00:05:44.450 align:middle line:10%
of the Millions of Years.

00:05:44.450 --> 00:05:47.120 align:middle line:10%
He's got his Resurrection
stick in his hand, which

00:05:47.120 --> 00:05:49.250 align:middle line:10%
the great French
symbolist Schwaller de

00:05:49.250 --> 00:05:51.650 align:middle line:10%
Lubicz said can
be used to channel

00:05:51.650 --> 00:05:57.050 align:middle line:10%
an energy or a force that's
similar to the Christian word,

00:05:57.050 --> 00:06:00.820 align:middle line:10%
the life force energy upon
which the world is built.

00:06:00.820 --> 00:06:02.900 align:middle line:84%
And so he's got this
stick in his hand

00:06:02.900 --> 00:06:06.555 align:middle line:84%
that indicates he is a master
of these higher frequencies.

00:06:06.555 --> 00:06:08.180 align:middle line:84%
And perhaps you just
take a moment now,

00:06:08.180 --> 00:06:10.580 align:middle line:84%
as we're sitting
here, think about what

00:06:10.580 --> 00:06:14.020 align:middle line:84%
it would be like to hold
such a stick in your hand.

00:06:14.020 --> 00:06:16.850 align:middle line:10%
What would it be like
if you were like a Jedi

00:06:16.850 --> 00:06:19.800 align:middle line:10%
and you had complete
control of this force?

00:06:19.800 --> 00:06:25.300 align:middle line:10%
That's an aspiration that
is fulfillable to us.

00:06:25.300 --> 00:06:27.210 align:middle line:84%
And so here he is
with the stick.

00:06:27.210 --> 00:06:30.510 align:middle line:84%
He's waving goodbye as
he's going into the stars.

00:06:30.510 --> 00:06:33.020 align:middle line:84%
And back in the early 2000s,
when I first looked at this

00:06:33.020 --> 00:06:34.770 align:middle line:84%
image, I said,
hey, wait a minute,

00:06:34.770 --> 00:06:37.010 align:middle line:84%
The way the ancient
Egyptians portrayed the Ark

00:06:37.010 --> 00:06:39.920 align:middle line:84%
of the Millions of Years looks
exactly like the way modern

00:06:39.920 --> 00:06:42.320 align:middle line:90%
science portrays a wormhole.

00:06:42.320 --> 00:06:43.640 align:middle line:90%
But how can that be?

00:06:43.640 --> 00:06:45.260 align:middle line:84%
We didn't even come
up with the idea

00:06:45.260 --> 00:06:48.590 align:middle line:84%
of this interdimensional portal
or shortcut through spacetime

00:06:48.590 --> 00:06:50.580 align:middle line:90%
until 1935.

00:06:50.580 --> 00:06:52.800 align:middle line:84%
We call it the
Einstein-Rosen Bridge.

00:06:52.800 --> 00:06:54.860 align:middle line:84%
And here are the
ancient Egyptians

00:06:54.860 --> 00:06:57.770 align:middle line:84%
telling us pictorially,
symbolically,

00:06:57.770 --> 00:07:03.100 align:middle line:84%
that this is a transmuted, flesh
and blood human being traveling

00:07:03.100 --> 00:07:04.640 align:middle line:84%
on the Ark of the
Millions of Years,

00:07:04.640 --> 00:07:06.660 align:middle line:90%
and it looks like a wormhole.

00:07:06.660 --> 00:07:08.360 align:middle line:90%
Is that nuts, or what?

00:07:08.360 --> 00:07:12.160 align:middle line:84%
Or is it possible the ancient
Egyptian gods who, they said,

00:07:12.160 --> 00:07:15.280 align:middle line:84%
came from the star Sirius
about 9 light years away,

00:07:15.280 --> 00:07:18.080 align:middle line:84%
traveled the stars
through wormholes?

00:07:18.080 --> 00:07:19.910 align:middle line:10%
No spaceship required.

00:07:19.910 --> 00:07:23.440 align:middle line:10%
They dematerialized their
body into information,

00:07:23.440 --> 00:07:27.100 align:middle line:10%
beamed it to Earth, and then
reconstituted their body

00:07:27.100 --> 00:07:29.180 align:middle line:10%
into a physical
flesh and blood form.

00:07:29.180 --> 00:07:31.810 align:middle line:84%
And then, according to
the ancient Egyptian myths

00:07:31.810 --> 00:07:35.120 align:middle line:84%
and legends, they
fashioned the human body.

00:07:35.120 --> 00:07:38.890 align:middle line:10%
They tweaked our DNA so that
our body itself would then

00:07:38.890 --> 00:07:40.810 align:middle line:10%
become a more conducive
vehicle for doing

00:07:40.810 --> 00:07:42.400 align:middle line:10%
exactly the same thing.

00:07:42.400 --> 00:07:45.970 align:middle line:10%
That is the basis for the
ancient Egyptian religious

00:07:45.970 --> 00:07:48.880 align:middle line:10%
traditions and their entire
civilization that lasted

00:07:48.880 --> 00:07:50.720 align:middle line:10%
for 3,000 years.

00:07:50.720 --> 00:07:54.040 align:middle line:10%
It was founded on the premise
that you are a star being,

00:07:54.040 --> 00:07:56.020 align:middle line:10%
you're temporarily
inhabiting this body,

00:07:56.020 --> 00:07:59.740 align:middle line:10%
and it can be tweaked or
transmuted into a higher form,

00:07:59.740 --> 00:08:02.940 align:middle line:10%
and then you can beam
yourself through the cosmos.

00:08:02.940 --> 00:08:05.010 align:middle line:90%
Anybody into that?

00:08:05.010 --> 00:08:06.030 align:middle line:90%
Me too.

00:08:06.030 --> 00:08:09.550 align:middle line:84%
It's like, yeah, that feels
perfectly natural to me.

00:08:09.550 --> 00:08:13.680 align:middle line:84%
So I started on this
quest to link together

00:08:13.680 --> 00:08:17.020 align:middle line:84%
modern quantum physics and
science regarding this.

00:08:17.020 --> 00:08:20.010 align:middle line:84%
And I'm very fortunate
that these days,

00:08:20.010 --> 00:08:22.530 align:middle line:84%
I'm part of a TV show
called "Ancient Aliens"

00:08:22.530 --> 00:08:24.090 align:middle line:90%
on the History Channel.

00:08:24.090 --> 00:08:25.210 align:middle line:90%
I've been on the show.

00:08:25.210 --> 00:08:26.010 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:08:26.010 --> 00:08:29.860 align:middle line:84%
I've been on the show
for 16 seasons now.

00:08:29.860 --> 00:08:32.820 align:middle line:10%
And I travel around
with my colleagues,

00:08:32.820 --> 00:08:36.870 align:middle line:10%
including Dr. Travis Taylor, who
is the chief scientist of the US

00:08:36.870 --> 00:08:40.720 align:middle line:10%
government's Unidentified Aerial
Phenomena Program, UAP program.

00:08:40.720 --> 00:08:42.669 align:middle line:10%
He is the guy.

00:08:42.669 --> 00:08:47.280 align:middle line:10%
And so I sit on stage with him
and I talk about this image.

00:08:47.280 --> 00:08:50.800 align:middle line:10%
And then Jay Stratton will
come along to other events.

00:08:50.800 --> 00:08:53.140 align:middle line:10%
He actually ran the UAP program.

00:08:53.140 --> 00:08:55.750 align:middle line:10%
Much of what they know
is, of course, classified.

00:08:55.750 --> 00:08:58.840 align:middle line:10%
And what they'll do is they'll
play a little game with me.

00:08:58.840 --> 00:09:00.960 align:middle line:10%
They'll say, hey,
William, you did

00:09:00.960 --> 00:09:05.090 align:middle line:10%
notice that stick in his hand,
it looks like a tuning fork.

00:09:05.090 --> 00:09:05.890 align:middle line:90%
Oh, yeah.

00:09:05.890 --> 00:09:08.350 align:middle line:84%
They're like, OK,
go look up resonance

00:09:08.350 --> 00:09:10.330 align:middle line:84%
and opening the
mouths of wormholes.

00:09:10.330 --> 00:09:12.070 align:middle line:84%
And when they're
telling me this,

00:09:12.070 --> 00:09:14.350 align:middle line:84%
I know that they
already know this.

00:09:14.350 --> 00:09:18.850 align:middle line:10%
This is common
knowledge in the UAP

00:09:18.850 --> 00:09:21.010 align:middle line:10%
programs, about
opening wormholes

00:09:21.010 --> 00:09:22.340 align:middle line:10%
and how they are doing it.

00:09:22.340 --> 00:09:26.120 align:middle line:10%
And the rest of us, we have
to just find a way to do it.

00:09:26.120 --> 00:09:27.320 align:middle line:90%
And this is how we do it.

00:09:27.320 --> 00:09:29.170 align:middle line:90%
We recognize that tones.

00:09:29.170 --> 00:09:32.740 align:middle line:84%
Lights and plants are
part of this process.

00:09:32.740 --> 00:09:34.540 align:middle line:84%
So this is why you
see the lotus blossom

00:09:34.540 --> 00:09:37.340 align:middle line:84%
at the end of the
ship of eternity.

00:09:37.340 --> 00:09:39.970 align:middle line:90%
The lotus symbolizes a gateway.

00:09:39.970 --> 00:09:42.730 align:middle line:84%
When beings emerge
out of a lotus,

00:09:42.730 --> 00:09:46.870 align:middle line:84%
it means they're being
imported from other dimensions,

00:09:46.870 --> 00:09:48.640 align:middle line:90%
similar to teleporting.

00:09:48.640 --> 00:09:50.450 align:middle line:90%
They just instantly manifest.

00:09:50.450 --> 00:09:53.290 align:middle line:10%
And so the lotus is
the ultimate symbol

00:09:53.290 --> 00:09:57.730 align:middle line:10%
then for traveling
between dimensions or even

00:09:57.730 --> 00:09:59.060 align:middle line:10%
between worlds.

00:09:59.060 --> 00:10:03.280 align:middle line:84%
And I believe that we are
all in this process of,

00:10:03.280 --> 00:10:05.240 align:middle line:90%
again, becoming star walkers.

00:10:05.240 --> 00:10:07.930 align:middle line:84%
We are star walkers,
and we're remembering

00:10:07.930 --> 00:10:10.130 align:middle line:90%
who we are as star walkers.

00:10:10.130 --> 00:10:14.050 align:middle line:84%
And I really do think that the
U-shaped symbol of the wormhole,

00:10:14.050 --> 00:10:16.480 align:middle line:84%
and I do understand
that wormholes also are

00:10:16.480 --> 00:10:18.680 align:middle line:90%
portrayed as toroidal as well.

00:10:18.680 --> 00:10:21.340 align:middle line:84%
But I stick to the
U shape because I

00:10:21.340 --> 00:10:24.620 align:middle line:84%
think of this as the
uber-ancient symbol,

00:10:24.620 --> 00:10:30.860 align:middle line:84%
all symbols ultimately emerge
from this uber-U-shaped symbol.

00:10:30.860 --> 00:10:34.930 align:middle line:84%
And the reason why I think
this is because, in my view,

00:10:34.930 --> 00:10:38.230 align:middle line:84%
the wormhole symbolizes
the process that all of us

00:10:38.230 --> 00:10:39.710 align:middle line:90%
are ongoing.

00:10:39.710 --> 00:10:41.960 align:middle line:90%
We all experienced a birth.

00:10:41.960 --> 00:10:44.510 align:middle line:90%
We're all experiencing a life.

00:10:44.510 --> 00:10:46.270 align:middle line:84%
We're in the mouth
of the wormhole here,

00:10:46.270 --> 00:10:48.130 align:middle line:84%
or the throat of
the wormhole rather.

00:10:48.130 --> 00:10:51.700 align:middle line:84%
We will all experience
a death or a transition

00:10:51.700 --> 00:10:53.690 align:middle line:90%
into another realm.

00:10:53.690 --> 00:10:56.800 align:middle line:84%
And the way we got here--
or think about it this way,

00:10:56.800 --> 00:11:00.410 align:middle line:84%
how did you get here
when you came here?

00:11:00.410 --> 00:11:02.920 align:middle line:84%
When your divine spark
within you arrived and you

00:11:02.920 --> 00:11:05.170 align:middle line:84%
spent all this time
in your mother's womb

00:11:05.170 --> 00:11:07.660 align:middle line:84%
and you came shooting
out of her portal,

00:11:07.660 --> 00:11:10.910 align:middle line:84%
isn't that a form of
a stargate in itself?

00:11:10.910 --> 00:11:12.790 align:middle line:10%
And now you're in this
matrix going, wow,

00:11:12.790 --> 00:11:17.490 align:middle line:10%
OK, how do I get back there?

00:11:17.490 --> 00:11:20.500 align:middle line:84%
And this is the process
that we're all living.

00:11:20.500 --> 00:11:22.540 align:middle line:10%
We all had an inhuman past.

00:11:22.540 --> 00:11:24.430 align:middle line:10%
We're experiencing
our present life.

00:11:24.430 --> 00:11:26.690 align:middle line:10%
We'll all experience a
resurrection in a future

00:11:26.690 --> 00:11:27.490 align:middle line:10%
somewhere else.

00:11:27.490 --> 00:11:29.730 align:middle line:10%
And this is why I think
it's important to study

00:11:29.730 --> 00:11:33.690 align:middle line:10%
this symbolism because it
ultimately tells us that there

00:11:33.690 --> 00:11:36.960 align:middle line:10%
are tools, there
are helpers, there

00:11:36.960 --> 00:11:41.850 align:middle line:10%
are ideas and concepts that
enable us to self-direct

00:11:41.850 --> 00:11:43.720 align:middle line:10%
our transfiguration.

00:11:43.720 --> 00:11:47.970 align:middle line:84%
Traditional religions say, oh,
yeah, you'll transfigure, just

00:11:47.970 --> 00:11:49.740 align:middle line:90%
not right now.

00:11:49.740 --> 00:11:54.090 align:middle line:84%
It'll happen when some special
figure, a Messiah, or a Christ,

00:11:54.090 --> 00:11:56.130 align:middle line:90%
or a Mahdi appears.

00:11:56.130 --> 00:11:58.600 align:middle line:84%
Then and only then
you can transfigure.

00:11:58.600 --> 00:12:01.260 align:middle line:84%
But the esoteric-minded ones
have always said, no, you

00:12:01.260 --> 00:12:03.580 align:middle line:90%
can self-direct this process.

00:12:03.580 --> 00:12:06.600 align:middle line:84%
You can take it
upon yourself to.

00:12:06.600 --> 00:12:11.880 align:middle line:84%
To find ways to actually
activate your transfigured light

00:12:11.880 --> 00:12:16.140 align:middle line:84%
body and enjoy it while
you're living on Earth.

00:12:16.140 --> 00:12:18.900 align:middle line:84%
And in fact, that is a
way to vastly improve,

00:12:18.900 --> 00:12:21.930 align:middle line:84%
not only your personal life,
but also the lives of your

00:12:21.930 --> 00:12:25.120 align:middle line:84%
loved ones and everyone on
the planet at this time.

00:12:25.120 --> 00:12:28.660 align:middle line:84%
And this, once again, is what we
see in ancient Egyptian imagery.

00:12:28.660 --> 00:12:30.880 align:middle line:84%
Here's our Ptolemaic
King once again.

00:12:30.880 --> 00:12:33.010 align:middle line:84%
He's sitting on his
feathered throne.

00:12:33.010 --> 00:12:35.370 align:middle line:90%
It's feathered because it flies.

00:12:35.370 --> 00:12:37.950 align:middle line:90%
It's an ascension throne.

00:12:37.950 --> 00:12:40.290 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to also suggest
to you that if he's

00:12:40.290 --> 00:12:43.940 align:middle line:84%
traveling aboard a wormhole,
that this feathered throne

00:12:43.940 --> 00:12:45.690 align:middle line:84%
that he's sitting on
is probably some kind

00:12:45.690 --> 00:12:47.580 align:middle line:90%
of anti-gravity device.

00:12:47.580 --> 00:12:50.042 align:middle line:84%
Because ordinarily,
as Paul said,

00:12:50.042 --> 00:12:52.250 align:middle line:84%
flesh and blood cannot
inherit the kingdom of heaven.

00:12:52.250 --> 00:12:54.660 align:middle line:84%
What that means is that
flesh and blood bodies can't

00:12:54.660 --> 00:12:56.280 align:middle line:90%
travel through a wormhole.

00:12:56.280 --> 00:12:59.135 align:middle line:84%
If a wormhole opened right
in this room right now

00:12:59.135 --> 00:13:00.510 align:middle line:84%
and you tried
walking through it,

00:13:00.510 --> 00:13:02.135 align:middle line:84%
it'd be like walking
through a blender.

00:13:02.135 --> 00:13:04.770 align:middle line:10%
You're going to get
your feathers ruffled.

00:13:04.770 --> 00:13:07.560 align:middle line:10%
A transfiguration is
required preparatory

00:13:07.560 --> 00:13:10.070 align:middle line:10%
to that, or some
protection mechanism.

00:13:10.070 --> 00:13:11.820 align:middle line:10%
And I'm going to talk
more about this here

00:13:11.820 --> 00:13:13.980 align:middle line:10%
in a moment in light
of recent videos

00:13:13.980 --> 00:13:18.390 align:middle line:10%
that have come out of UAPs
that absolutely demonstrate

00:13:18.390 --> 00:13:19.680 align:middle line:10%
this to be a fact.

00:13:19.680 --> 00:13:23.130 align:middle line:84%
So we have this pharaoh on
his feather ascension throne.

00:13:23.130 --> 00:13:24.940 align:middle line:84%
He's got his key of
life in his hand.

00:13:24.940 --> 00:13:27.040 align:middle line:90%
He's got his resurrection stick.

00:13:27.040 --> 00:13:29.640 align:middle line:84%
He's got his wormhole-shaped
boat, his Ark

00:13:29.640 --> 00:13:30.900 align:middle line:90%
of the Millions of Years.

00:13:30.900 --> 00:13:32.440 align:middle line:90%
He's good to go.

00:13:32.440 --> 00:13:35.700 align:middle line:84%
He's got his crown of wisdom,
the resurrection stick,

00:13:35.700 --> 00:13:40.580 align:middle line:84%
the key of life, the feathered
ascension throne, everything.

00:13:40.580 --> 00:13:43.940 align:middle line:84%
All of these are
consciousness attributes.

00:13:43.940 --> 00:13:46.660 align:middle line:84%
They're not really-- you
can't go down to Nordstrom

00:13:46.660 --> 00:13:49.780 align:middle line:84%
and say, hey, I want my
new Chanel crown of wisdom,

00:13:49.780 --> 00:13:52.270 align:middle line:84%
or go to Armani and
say, hey, do you

00:13:52.270 --> 00:13:54.170 align:middle line:84%
have your latest
resurrection stick?

00:13:54.170 --> 00:13:56.240 align:middle line:90%
And this doesn't work that way.

00:13:56.240 --> 00:13:59.410 align:middle line:84%
These are probably
actually more like symbols

00:13:59.410 --> 00:14:02.050 align:middle line:90%
of attributes within us.

00:14:02.050 --> 00:14:03.860 align:middle line:84%
Now, just think about
this for a second.

00:14:03.860 --> 00:14:06.520 align:middle line:84%
What if you're
thinking anatomically

00:14:06.520 --> 00:14:11.290 align:middle line:84%
about a resurrection stick,
what do you think that could be?

00:14:11.290 --> 00:14:14.760 align:middle line:10%
What would be the
resurrection stick within you?

00:14:14.760 --> 00:14:15.880 align:middle line:10%
Your spine.

00:14:15.880 --> 00:14:16.870 align:middle line:10%
Yeah, absolutely.

00:14:16.870 --> 00:14:18.940 align:middle line:10%
What would the
crown of wisdom be?

00:14:18.940 --> 00:14:22.750 align:middle line:10%
Wouldn't that be your activated
two hemispheres of your brain?

00:14:22.750 --> 00:14:23.550 align:middle line:10%
Yeah.

00:14:23.550 --> 00:14:25.450 align:middle line:10%
What is the key of life?

00:14:25.450 --> 00:14:27.540 align:middle line:84%
Well, the answer is
in Tibetan Buddhism,

00:14:27.540 --> 00:14:30.910 align:middle line:90%
is that the key of life is love.

00:14:30.910 --> 00:14:33.140 align:middle line:90%
Compassion in action.

00:14:33.140 --> 00:14:35.710 align:middle line:84%
So right away, we've just
suddenly put ourselves

00:14:35.710 --> 00:14:37.330 align:middle line:84%
on this boat going,
I better learn

00:14:37.330 --> 00:14:39.130 align:middle line:84%
how to activate the
power of my spine

00:14:39.130 --> 00:14:41.000 align:middle line:90%
and my neurosecretory system.

00:14:41.000 --> 00:14:42.890 align:middle line:90%
This is what it's all about.

00:14:42.890 --> 00:14:46.510 align:middle line:84%
It's recognizing that
our body is the stargate

00:14:46.510 --> 00:14:48.650 align:middle line:90%
that we have been looking for.

00:14:48.650 --> 00:14:50.560 align:middle line:10%
And once we learn
how to, the word

00:14:50.560 --> 00:14:54.400 align:middle line:10%
is transfigure it, up
level it, activate it,

00:14:54.400 --> 00:14:57.350 align:middle line:10%
we become star walkers.

00:14:57.350 --> 00:14:59.570 align:middle line:10%
That's the idea.

00:14:59.570 --> 00:15:03.680 align:middle line:10%
In my journey-- this
took me back to 2002,

00:15:03.680 --> 00:15:05.000 align:middle line:10%
something like that.

00:15:05.000 --> 00:15:09.590 align:middle line:10%
Again, when you all hit 60, if
you think something happened

00:15:09.590 --> 00:15:11.930 align:middle line:10%
10 years ago, it was 20.

00:15:11.930 --> 00:15:14.340 align:middle line:10%
OK, just going to
prepare you for that.

00:15:14.340 --> 00:15:16.820 align:middle line:10%
So if I say this
was 20 years ago,

00:15:16.820 --> 00:15:18.860 align:middle line:10%
it could have been 40 years ago.

00:15:18.860 --> 00:15:21.140 align:middle line:10%
All right, so it
was a long time ago

00:15:21.140 --> 00:15:25.100 align:middle line:10%
when I first take this picture
up on the ceiling at the Temple

00:15:25.100 --> 00:15:26.660 align:middle line:10%
of Hathor at Dendera.

00:15:26.660 --> 00:15:30.080 align:middle line:10%
And I get back to our boat,
our cruise ship on the Nile,

00:15:30.080 --> 00:15:33.110 align:middle line:10%
and I'm feeling
really satisfied.

00:15:33.110 --> 00:15:35.510 align:middle line:10%
I had been talking with
my group about all this

00:15:35.510 --> 00:15:37.730 align:middle line:10%
and I finally got the picture.

00:15:37.730 --> 00:15:41.600 align:middle line:10%
And I get back to my
stateroom on the boat.

00:15:41.600 --> 00:15:42.922 align:middle line:10%
And a phone call comes in.

00:15:42.922 --> 00:15:44.880 align:middle line:10%
And says, hey, William,
it's time to come down.

00:15:44.880 --> 00:15:48.500 align:middle line:10%
We're going to all go
watch the belly dancer.

00:15:48.500 --> 00:15:50.928 align:middle line:84%
And I'm like, I'm just
going to take a nap.

00:15:50.928 --> 00:15:52.470 align:middle line:84%
I'm not really into
the belly dancer.

00:15:52.470 --> 00:15:54.480 align:middle line:84%
A few minutes
later, another call.

00:15:54.480 --> 00:15:56.810 align:middle line:84%
William, we're going to
watch the belly dancer.

00:15:56.810 --> 00:15:58.830 align:middle line:84%
I'm not really into
the belly dancer.

00:15:58.830 --> 00:16:00.565 align:middle line:10%
Five minutes later,
William, you have

00:16:00.565 --> 00:16:02.440 align:middle line:10%
to come down here and
watch the belly dancer.

00:16:02.440 --> 00:16:04.920 align:middle line:10%
It's like, OK, so off I go.

00:16:04.920 --> 00:16:07.170 align:middle line:90%
It wasn't a belly dancer.

00:16:07.170 --> 00:16:11.790 align:middle line:84%
It ended up being a whirling
dervish dancer performing

00:16:11.790 --> 00:16:15.160 align:middle line:84%
an 800-year-old
mystic Islamic dance.

00:16:15.160 --> 00:16:17.700 align:middle line:10%
This guy starts
spinning in place,

00:16:17.700 --> 00:16:22.200 align:middle line:10%
going into a deep meditation,
deep state of meditation.

00:16:22.200 --> 00:16:24.720 align:middle line:84%
And he starts spinning
the skirt that he's

00:16:24.720 --> 00:16:26.400 align:middle line:90%
wearing around his body.

00:16:26.400 --> 00:16:29.610 align:middle line:84%
And I looked at that
and I thought, hey,

00:16:29.610 --> 00:16:32.560 align:middle line:90%
that looks like a UFO.

00:16:32.560 --> 00:16:35.740 align:middle line:90%
That looks like a flying saucer.

00:16:35.740 --> 00:16:39.030 align:middle line:84%
He's like Elijah ascending into
the heavens in a whirlwind,

00:16:39.030 --> 00:16:41.760 align:middle line:84%
or like, is this is
Ezekiel's throne?

00:16:41.760 --> 00:16:45.060 align:middle line:84%
This is like all these guys that
I see in these winged rings that

00:16:45.060 --> 00:16:48.970 align:middle line:84%
are in all this ancient art,
the Sumerian art in particular.

00:16:48.970 --> 00:16:53.250 align:middle line:84%
And I'm just like, my gosh, look
at this guy, look at him go.

00:16:53.250 --> 00:16:55.030 align:middle line:90%
This is phenomenal.

00:16:55.030 --> 00:16:58.200 align:middle line:84%
And then the next thing I know,
there's this cracking sound

00:16:58.200 --> 00:17:00.980 align:middle line:90%
on the floor, and it's my jaw.

00:17:00.980 --> 00:17:05.970 align:middle line:84%
[LAUGHTER] Because he had
pulled out a second skirt

00:17:05.970 --> 00:17:09.040 align:middle line:84%
and was spinning it
counterclockwise now.

00:17:09.040 --> 00:17:11.810 align:middle line:84%
And I'm like, look at
what he's just done.

00:17:11.810 --> 00:17:15.920 align:middle line:84%
This is the way modern science
portrays a toroidal wormhole,

00:17:15.920 --> 00:17:18.619 align:middle line:84%
and here is our
whirling dervish dancer.

00:17:18.619 --> 00:17:21.930 align:middle line:84%
He's just turned himself
into the shape of a wormhole.

00:17:21.930 --> 00:17:24.560 align:middle line:84%
And I'm like, that's what
I've been trying to say.

00:17:24.560 --> 00:17:28.480 align:middle line:10%
And these guys have already
known this for 800 years.

00:17:28.480 --> 00:17:31.600 align:middle line:10%
And they're so smart,
they put it into a dance

00:17:31.600 --> 00:17:34.880 align:middle line:10%
so that everybody could
enjoy it and get the benefit.

00:17:34.880 --> 00:17:38.990 align:middle line:84%
But they don't-- my gosh,
this was unbelievable to me.

00:17:38.990 --> 00:17:42.980 align:middle line:10%
And, again, when I was
first putting this together,

00:17:42.980 --> 00:17:45.200 align:middle line:10%
we had started
the war on terror.

00:17:45.200 --> 00:17:48.400 align:middle line:10%
And it had been proclaimed
we're going to spend $1 trillion

00:17:48.400 --> 00:17:52.130 align:middle line:10%
prosecuting the war on terror
beginning in 2003 onward.

00:17:52.130 --> 00:17:55.120 align:middle line:10%
I'm like, why don't
we spend $1 trillion

00:17:55.120 --> 00:17:57.970 align:middle line:10%
teaching children the
wormhole dance, which

00:17:57.970 --> 00:17:59.240 align:middle line:10%
is what I called it.

00:17:59.240 --> 00:18:02.800 align:middle line:10%
Let's go into mystic
Islam and combine it

00:18:02.800 --> 00:18:04.760 align:middle line:10%
with mystic Christianity.

00:18:04.760 --> 00:18:08.740 align:middle line:84%
And let's show that these
secrets, these ideas

00:18:08.740 --> 00:18:10.880 align:middle line:84%
are everywhere in
the ancient world.

00:18:10.880 --> 00:18:12.880 align:middle line:84%
And this is what
we got to focus on.

00:18:12.880 --> 00:18:16.940 align:middle line:84%
Not holy wars about territories
and this kind of thing,

00:18:16.940 --> 00:18:20.800 align:middle line:84%
but we really got to open up our
minds to these possibilities.

00:18:20.800 --> 00:18:23.150 align:middle line:84%
And this was why it
was so inspiring.

00:18:23.150 --> 00:18:26.470 align:middle line:84%
So then after the
dance, his assistant

00:18:26.470 --> 00:18:28.550 align:middle line:90%
comes up with a linen shroud.

00:18:28.550 --> 00:18:31.510 align:middle line:84%
He took the second skirt,
wrapped it into a bundle.

00:18:31.510 --> 00:18:35.410 align:middle line:84%
And for us Western dummies,
they wrapped the bundle

00:18:35.410 --> 00:18:39.070 align:middle line:84%
in the shroud like a
baby and fed milk to it.

00:18:39.070 --> 00:18:42.210 align:middle line:90%
Again, how did you get here?

00:18:42.210 --> 00:18:44.170 align:middle line:90%
Where did you come from?

00:18:44.170 --> 00:18:45.790 align:middle line:90%
What are you doing here?

00:18:45.790 --> 00:18:48.660 align:middle line:84%
And when it's time to leave,
where are you going to go

00:18:48.660 --> 00:18:50.400 align:middle line:84%
and how are you
going to get there?

00:18:50.400 --> 00:18:54.000 align:middle line:84%
It seems to me this is what
this dance was answering.

00:18:54.000 --> 00:18:58.260 align:middle line:84%
And it was hugely inspiring
to me in my journey.

00:18:58.260 --> 00:19:00.210 align:middle line:90%
More recently, I was in Egypt.

00:19:00.210 --> 00:19:02.430 align:middle line:84%
And I just wanted to share
a quick video with you

00:19:02.430 --> 00:19:06.690 align:middle line:84%
so you can see the energy that
these whirling dervish dancers

00:19:06.690 --> 00:19:08.811 align:middle line:90%
just exude in the process.

00:19:08.811 --> 00:19:12.739 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:19:12.739 --> 00:19:35.870 align:middle line:90%


00:19:35.870 --> 00:19:37.980 align:middle line:90%
Is that cool, or what?

00:19:37.980 --> 00:19:39.160 align:middle line:90%
I mean, amazing.

00:19:39.160 --> 00:19:41.400 align:middle line:90%
[APPLAUSE]

00:19:41.400 --> 00:19:44.740 align:middle line:84%
So I get back home
after that event.

00:19:44.740 --> 00:19:45.910 align:middle line:90%
A few years go by.

00:19:45.910 --> 00:19:50.250 align:middle line:84%
I'm up at a UFO
conference in California.

00:19:50.250 --> 00:19:55.140 align:middle line:10%
A lovely couple comes
up to me and says,

00:19:55.140 --> 00:19:57.940 align:middle line:10%
we both have PhDs from the
Harvard Divinity School.

00:19:57.940 --> 00:19:59.380 align:middle line:10%
We work for the Dalai Lama.

00:19:59.380 --> 00:20:03.090 align:middle line:10%
Our specialty is the Tibetan
concept of transfiguration,

00:20:03.090 --> 00:20:04.100 align:middle line:10%
the rainbow light body.

00:20:04.100 --> 00:20:05.500 align:middle line:10%
Are you familiar with it?

00:20:05.500 --> 00:20:08.105 align:middle line:10%
And I said, no, I have no idea
what you're talking about.

00:20:08.105 --> 00:20:09.480 align:middle line:10%
And they said,
well, that's funny

00:20:09.480 --> 00:20:12.870 align:middle line:10%
because you're work in
Egypt answers questions

00:20:12.870 --> 00:20:16.140 align:middle line:10%
about this idea, the rainbow
body and transfiguration,

00:20:16.140 --> 00:20:19.710 align:middle line:10%
that the Tibetans won't answer
either because it's secret

00:20:19.710 --> 00:20:22.190 align:middle line:10%
or because they don't
know the answer.

00:20:22.190 --> 00:20:24.915 align:middle line:10%
And I'm like, OK,
I'm really intrigued.

00:20:24.915 --> 00:20:26.040 align:middle line:10%
What are you talking about?

00:20:26.040 --> 00:20:29.280 align:middle line:10%
And they said, in the Tibetan
rainbow light body tradition,

00:20:29.280 --> 00:20:32.880 align:middle line:10%
they teach that the
human body was designed

00:20:32.880 --> 00:20:37.260 align:middle line:10%
to have its frequency
accelerated until it

00:20:37.260 --> 00:20:40.980 align:middle line:10%
transfigures into
five-colored rainbow light,

00:20:40.980 --> 00:20:43.740 align:middle line:10%
leaving behind only hair, toe,
and fingernails which have

00:20:43.740 --> 00:20:46.050 align:middle line:10%
no nerves to be transmuted.

00:20:46.050 --> 00:20:48.660 align:middle line:84%
And they said, what
they wanted to know

00:20:48.660 --> 00:20:53.640 align:middle line:84%
was that once they attain this
transfiguration, they said,

00:20:53.640 --> 00:20:59.070 align:middle line:84%
the Lamas can journey or travel
to any of 13 star systems

00:20:59.070 --> 00:21:00.850 align:middle line:90%
where this teaching is taught.

00:21:00.850 --> 00:21:04.050 align:middle line:10%
And what they wanted to know
was, how do they get there?

00:21:04.050 --> 00:21:06.930 align:middle line:10%
Once they attain this
transfigured body,

00:21:06.930 --> 00:21:09.070 align:middle line:10%
how do they travel
between star systems?

00:21:09.070 --> 00:21:11.880 align:middle line:10%
And then they said, we were
watching your presentation

00:21:11.880 --> 00:21:17.730 align:middle line:10%
about the star walkers and the
wormhole dancer, as you call it,

00:21:17.730 --> 00:21:20.040 align:middle line:10%
and we got the answer.

00:21:20.040 --> 00:21:21.690 align:middle line:84%
Once again, the
Tibetans are saying

00:21:21.690 --> 00:21:25.680 align:middle line:84%
our body is a vehicle
of transfiguration that

00:21:25.680 --> 00:21:27.340 align:middle line:90%
can be transformed.

00:21:27.340 --> 00:21:30.300 align:middle line:84%
And so I started
looking at this idea,

00:21:30.300 --> 00:21:35.610 align:middle line:84%
and this is Padmasambhava,
Tibetan rainbow light body guru.

00:21:35.610 --> 00:21:38.020 align:middle line:90%
He sits on his lotus throne.

00:21:38.020 --> 00:21:40.030 align:middle line:90%
He's got a resurrection stick.

00:21:40.030 --> 00:21:42.390 align:middle line:90%
He's got his crown of glory on.

00:21:42.390 --> 00:21:44.670 align:middle line:84%
And he's holding a
vajra in his hand,

00:21:44.670 --> 00:21:48.690 align:middle line:84%
which is the Tibetan symbol
for compassion and action.

00:21:48.690 --> 00:21:52.270 align:middle line:84%
It's the Tibetan equivalent
of the Egyptian key of life.

00:21:52.270 --> 00:21:55.800 align:middle line:84%
He's got these golden rays and
rainbow rays coming off of him.

00:21:55.800 --> 00:22:00.630 align:middle line:84%
And around his body is a
transparent image or ring

00:22:00.630 --> 00:22:02.940 align:middle line:90%
that looks like a stargate.

00:22:02.940 --> 00:22:05.910 align:middle line:10%
And I instantly got it.

00:22:05.910 --> 00:22:09.450 align:middle line:10%
The Tibetans are talking
about exactly the same thing

00:22:09.450 --> 00:22:11.620 align:middle line:10%
that the ancient Egyptians
were talking about.

00:22:11.620 --> 00:22:13.170 align:middle line:84%
But now the Tibetans
are saying, you

00:22:13.170 --> 00:22:17.360 align:middle line:84%
can travel to 13 star
systems, including our own.

00:22:17.360 --> 00:22:21.510 align:middle line:84%
That means you've got beings
coming and going from Sirius,

00:22:21.510 --> 00:22:23.860 align:middle line:90%
Pleiades, Orion, Arcturus.

00:22:23.860 --> 00:22:27.180 align:middle line:84%
These are the commonly
named star systems

00:22:27.180 --> 00:22:28.810 align:middle line:84%
in ancient myth and
sacred tradition.

00:22:28.810 --> 00:22:30.477 align:middle line:10%
And they're talking
there's another nine

00:22:30.477 --> 00:22:34.060 align:middle line:10%
more that they are
coming and going from.

00:22:34.060 --> 00:22:37.570 align:middle line:10%
And I'm thinking, this is
absolutely astonishing.

00:22:37.570 --> 00:22:42.120 align:middle line:84%
And the message is, this is
who-- this is your true self.

00:22:42.120 --> 00:22:47.060 align:middle line:10%
You and I identify with these
bodies, But to the Tibetans,

00:22:47.060 --> 00:22:48.990 align:middle line:10%
that's actually you.

00:22:48.990 --> 00:22:50.710 align:middle line:90%
That is within you.

00:22:50.710 --> 00:22:54.300 align:middle line:84%
This is what is manifested,
this physical flesh and blood

00:22:54.300 --> 00:22:57.760 align:middle line:84%
body in order to have
this earthly experience.

00:22:57.760 --> 00:22:59.670 align:middle line:10%
But it's such point
that you decide

00:22:59.670 --> 00:23:02.470 align:middle line:10%
you want to transcend
this earthly experience,

00:23:02.470 --> 00:23:04.020 align:middle line:10%
this flesh and
blood body can then

00:23:04.020 --> 00:23:07.270 align:middle line:10%
be transfigured into
its original form.

00:23:07.270 --> 00:23:10.290 align:middle line:84%
And, again, it's not
something that you go get.

00:23:10.290 --> 00:23:14.170 align:middle line:84%
You don't get it at Best Buy,
you don't get it at Nordstrom.

00:23:14.170 --> 00:23:16.390 align:middle line:90%
You already are it.

00:23:16.390 --> 00:23:17.920 align:middle line:90%
It is within you.

00:23:17.920 --> 00:23:21.850 align:middle line:10%
And this is the message that is
conveyed over and over again, is

00:23:21.850 --> 00:23:25.810 align:middle line:10%
that it's about identifying
with this aspect of ourselves

00:23:25.810 --> 00:23:31.160 align:middle line:10%
and living our life from
this inside perspective out.

00:23:31.160 --> 00:23:34.510 align:middle line:84%
And so this to me then
became a real key piece

00:23:34.510 --> 00:23:39.000 align:middle line:84%
in my journey to link together
the various transfiguration

00:23:39.000 --> 00:23:39.800 align:middle line:90%
teachings.

00:23:39.800 --> 00:23:41.383 align:middle line:84%
And one thing that
the Tibetans teach,

00:23:41.383 --> 00:23:43.360 align:middle line:84%
which is I think is so
profound and powerful

00:23:43.360 --> 00:23:45.880 align:middle line:84%
and it's something the ancient
Egyptians taught as well,

00:23:45.880 --> 00:23:49.270 align:middle line:84%
is that just looking at
images, making eye to eye,

00:23:49.270 --> 00:23:53.260 align:middle line:84%
soul to soul contact with
avatars, like Padmasambhava

00:23:53.260 --> 00:23:57.550 align:middle line:84%
here through an image, they
can transmit those codes to you

00:23:57.550 --> 00:24:00.040 align:middle line:84%
as you're sitting here
looking at the image.

00:24:00.040 --> 00:24:02.770 align:middle line:10%
As you're absorbing
this energy coming

00:24:02.770 --> 00:24:06.400 align:middle line:10%
from this magnificent
tonka, a part of you

00:24:06.400 --> 00:24:10.370 align:middle line:10%
is going, at last, that is me.

00:24:10.370 --> 00:24:16.270 align:middle line:10%
Feed me, feed me, talk to me,
activate me, think about me.

00:24:16.270 --> 00:24:19.870 align:middle line:10%
This is the angel on the
side of the shore, again,

00:24:19.870 --> 00:24:23.200 align:middle line:10%
that we rode in on
the boat with but we

00:24:23.200 --> 00:24:25.970 align:middle line:10%
forgot about who we truly are.

00:24:25.970 --> 00:24:28.690 align:middle line:84%
And, again, this is the primary
teaching of the Tibetans,

00:24:28.690 --> 00:24:31.700 align:middle line:84%
but it extends into
Gnostic Christianity.

00:24:31.700 --> 00:24:34.030 align:middle line:84%
They refer to this
as the divine spark

00:24:34.030 --> 00:24:36.370 align:middle line:84%
and the glory body,
the resurrection body,

00:24:36.370 --> 00:24:37.580 align:middle line:90%
the light body.

00:24:37.580 --> 00:24:40.550 align:middle line:84%
And all of us have
this within us.

00:24:40.550 --> 00:24:44.230 align:middle line:10%
And by beginning to identify
with this aspect of ourselves,

00:24:44.230 --> 00:24:47.650 align:middle line:10%
it brings healing to our
physical body, elevated states

00:24:47.650 --> 00:24:52.540 align:middle line:10%
of joy, immense and enhanced
powers of manifestation,

00:24:52.540 --> 00:24:56.110 align:middle line:10%
and ultimately, a sense
of wholeness and holiness

00:24:56.110 --> 00:25:00.340 align:middle line:10%
that is matched only
by the great avatars.

00:25:00.340 --> 00:25:06.070 align:middle line:10%
Now, this might seem like a
heady concept to you, to some,

00:25:06.070 --> 00:25:08.090 align:middle line:10%
but you're already
familiar with it.

00:25:08.090 --> 00:25:10.900 align:middle line:84%
If you ever saw the
movie "The Wizard of Oz,"

00:25:10.900 --> 00:25:15.160 align:middle line:84%
you saw a great demonstration of
the way the Tibetans described

00:25:15.160 --> 00:25:16.460 align:middle line:90%
this rainbow light body.

00:25:16.460 --> 00:25:19.750 align:middle line:84%
Remember in the story, Dorothy
has fallen into a dream.

00:25:19.750 --> 00:25:22.870 align:middle line:84%
She goes up in a whirlwind
where she ascends into a higher

00:25:22.870 --> 00:25:27.040 align:middle line:84%
frequency realm called
Oz, a Hebrew word that

00:25:27.040 --> 00:25:28.880 align:middle line:90%
means strength is within.

00:25:28.880 --> 00:25:31.180 align:middle line:84%
I think it means
the light is within.

00:25:31.180 --> 00:25:33.850 align:middle line:84%
And suddenly, Dorothy is
on the yellow brick road

00:25:33.850 --> 00:25:36.550 align:middle line:84%
and she encounters
an orb of light

00:25:36.550 --> 00:25:38.870 align:middle line:90%
that manifests out of nowhere.

00:25:38.870 --> 00:25:40.280 align:middle line:90%
This is an apport.

00:25:40.280 --> 00:25:45.070 align:middle line:84%
This is a manifestation
of an avatar type being

00:25:45.070 --> 00:25:47.720 align:middle line:84%
that suddenly is
floating in front of her.

00:25:47.720 --> 00:25:49.990 align:middle line:84%
And as the scene
develops, we suddenly

00:25:49.990 --> 00:25:53.080 align:middle line:84%
see this luminous,
radiant humanoid

00:25:53.080 --> 00:25:56.260 align:middle line:84%
being holding a star
stick in her hand,

00:25:56.260 --> 00:25:59.180 align:middle line:84%
and wearing a crown
and a luminous garment.

00:25:59.180 --> 00:26:02.750 align:middle line:84%
This is the Good Witch
Glinda in the story.

00:26:02.750 --> 00:26:07.270 align:middle line:84%
But she is wearing exactly the
same symbols or accouterments

00:26:07.270 --> 00:26:09.160 align:middle line:84%
that we see in the
Tibetan artwork

00:26:09.160 --> 00:26:12.160 align:middle line:84%
of their resurrected
beings and the same symbols

00:26:12.160 --> 00:26:14.720 align:middle line:84%
that we just saw in
ancient Egypt a moment ago.

00:26:14.720 --> 00:26:18.550 align:middle line:84%
So this is, to me,
a way to visualize

00:26:18.550 --> 00:26:22.240 align:middle line:84%
this aspect of
ourselves and the power

00:26:22.240 --> 00:26:23.510 align:middle line:90%
that we all have within us.

00:26:23.510 --> 00:26:25.960 align:middle line:84%
And I believe that this is
what the ancient Egyptians were

00:26:25.960 --> 00:26:29.080 align:middle line:84%
demonstrating in their
artwork portraying Osiris,

00:26:29.080 --> 00:26:30.820 align:middle line:90%
their God of Resurrection.

00:26:30.820 --> 00:26:33.740 align:middle line:84%
That he's, again, on his
feathered ascension throne,

00:26:33.740 --> 00:26:35.620 align:middle line:84%
but the way they
portray the swirling

00:26:35.620 --> 00:26:39.040 align:middle line:84%
energy of his crown,
his green skin,

00:26:39.040 --> 00:26:43.310 align:middle line:84%
he's green symbolic of rebirth,
renewal, and regeneration.

00:26:43.310 --> 00:26:46.600 align:middle line:84%
It's the same imagery that we
see in the Tibetan artwork.

00:26:46.600 --> 00:26:49.000 align:middle line:84%
And the reason
why, for emphasis,

00:26:49.000 --> 00:26:51.430 align:middle line:84%
is that this is not
an Egyptian teaching.

00:26:51.430 --> 00:26:53.200 align:middle line:90%
It's not a Tibetan teaching.

00:26:53.200 --> 00:26:55.150 align:middle line:90%
It's not a Christian teaching.

00:26:55.150 --> 00:26:56.600 align:middle line:90%
It's cosmic.

00:26:56.600 --> 00:27:00.250 align:middle line:84%
This is the original
cosmic spiritual teaching

00:27:00.250 --> 00:27:04.210 align:middle line:84%
that found its way into all
these various earthly religious

00:27:04.210 --> 00:27:07.450 align:middle line:84%
and spiritual traditions
that then, unfortunately,

00:27:07.450 --> 00:27:09.560 align:middle line:90%
were turned into orthodoxy.

00:27:09.560 --> 00:27:14.820 align:middle line:84%
And the average card-carrying
Tibetan, Christian, Jew

00:27:14.820 --> 00:27:18.710 align:middle line:84%
and Muslim are
oblivious to this.

00:27:18.710 --> 00:27:21.430 align:middle line:84%
And this is the problem that
we're experiencing in our world

00:27:21.430 --> 00:27:22.230 align:middle line:90%
right now.

00:27:22.230 --> 00:27:25.940 align:middle line:84%
If we elevate our consciousness
more to this direction,

00:27:25.940 --> 00:27:28.070 align:middle line:84%
it brings ideas and
inspirations for how

00:27:28.070 --> 00:27:29.640 align:middle line:90%
to solve our earthly problems.

00:27:29.640 --> 00:27:33.480 align:middle line:84%
And we have no more time for
them because it's all nonsense.

00:27:33.480 --> 00:27:35.610 align:middle line:90%
It works on the 3D Earth plane.

00:27:35.610 --> 00:27:38.915 align:middle line:84%
But once we tap into this,
we're so far beyond that,

00:27:38.915 --> 00:27:41.800 align:middle line:84%
that we don't want to even
function in the mundane world

00:27:41.800 --> 00:27:42.600 align:middle line:90%
anymore.

00:27:42.600 --> 00:27:45.290 align:middle line:84%
And that's why we call
this stairway to the stars.

00:27:45.290 --> 00:27:47.690 align:middle line:84%
We're all on this
stairway right now.

00:27:47.690 --> 00:27:49.340 align:middle line:84%
Some of us are maybe
at higher rungs,

00:27:49.340 --> 00:27:51.420 align:middle line:84%
but we all have our
head in the stars.

00:27:51.420 --> 00:27:53.930 align:middle line:84%
And once you got your
head in the stars,

00:27:53.930 --> 00:27:57.240 align:middle line:84%
I'm asking you to consider, this
is where you want to go with it.

00:27:57.240 --> 00:28:00.320 align:middle line:10%
You're not trying to hitch
a ride on a spaceship.

00:28:00.320 --> 00:28:02.600 align:middle line:10%
I just don't-- I caution that.

00:28:02.600 --> 00:28:07.280 align:middle line:84%
Some technological 3D spaceship
might be good for a weekend

00:28:07.280 --> 00:28:08.810 align:middle line:90%
holiday to the Pleiades.

00:28:08.810 --> 00:28:13.100 align:middle line:84%
But for your eternal
spiritual development,

00:28:13.100 --> 00:28:15.920 align:middle line:84%
we want to go more
in this direction.

00:28:15.920 --> 00:28:19.160 align:middle line:84%
Ptah is the ancient
Egyptian god that's

00:28:19.160 --> 00:28:22.990 align:middle line:84%
portrayed here standing
with the resurrection

00:28:22.990 --> 00:28:26.410 align:middle line:84%
stick in his hand and the
rainbow-colored stairway

00:28:26.410 --> 00:28:27.410 align:middle line:90%
to heaven behind him.

00:28:27.410 --> 00:28:29.670 align:middle line:84%
They call it the Backbone
of Osiris or the stairway

00:28:29.670 --> 00:28:30.470 align:middle line:90%
to heaven.

00:28:30.470 --> 00:28:32.550 align:middle line:84%
He was the Egyptian
god of technology.

00:28:32.550 --> 00:28:36.250 align:middle line:84%
The Egyptian said, came to
Earth from Sirius, fashioned

00:28:36.250 --> 00:28:39.730 align:middle line:84%
the human body, made it
a more conducive vehicle

00:28:39.730 --> 00:28:41.480 align:middle line:90%
for the ascension of the soul.

00:28:41.480 --> 00:28:43.810 align:middle line:84%
And I think it's just
pretty interesting

00:28:43.810 --> 00:28:46.630 align:middle line:84%
the way the Egyptians
portrayed him,

00:28:46.630 --> 00:28:51.010 align:middle line:84%
how closely it corresponds with
the way the Tibetans portrayed

00:28:51.010 --> 00:28:52.580 align:middle line:90%
the rainbow light body.

00:28:52.580 --> 00:28:55.400 align:middle line:90%
This is Nefertari in her tomb.

00:28:55.400 --> 00:28:58.430 align:middle line:84%
She was the wife of
the great Ramesses II.

00:28:58.430 --> 00:29:01.300 align:middle line:84%
And she wears a
transparent linen garment,

00:29:01.300 --> 00:29:04.990 align:middle line:84%
indicative of her attainment of
her afterlife, garment of light.

00:29:04.990 --> 00:29:07.660 align:middle line:84%
She holds in her hand
the Egyptian hieroglyph

00:29:07.660 --> 00:29:11.560 align:middle line:84%
for new clothes, which
she is offering to Ptah.

00:29:11.560 --> 00:29:16.480 align:middle line:10%
The reason why we dress our
children up and ourselves up

00:29:16.480 --> 00:29:20.290 align:middle line:10%
in new clothes at
Easter is a reference

00:29:20.290 --> 00:29:22.730 align:middle line:10%
to this ancient
Egyptian tradition.

00:29:22.730 --> 00:29:25.280 align:middle line:84%
What she's actually saying
is, thank you, Ptah,

00:29:25.280 --> 00:29:28.700 align:middle line:84%
for helping me to weave my
higher dimensional, my higher

00:29:28.700 --> 00:29:32.210 align:middle line:84%
frequency light body so
that now I can travel

00:29:32.210 --> 00:29:34.410 align:middle line:90%
the interdimensional wormholes.

00:29:34.410 --> 00:29:38.010 align:middle line:10%
This is Ptah's business card.

00:29:38.010 --> 00:29:42.840 align:middle line:10%
[LAUGHTER] He's the architect
of heaven and earth, the master

00:29:42.840 --> 00:29:45.480 align:middle line:10%
craftsman and working
metal sculptor, designer,

00:29:45.480 --> 00:29:47.560 align:middle line:10%
and the fashioner of
the bodies of men.

00:29:47.560 --> 00:29:51.100 align:middle line:10%
He's even got a double
helix in his hieroglyph.

00:29:51.100 --> 00:29:53.720 align:middle line:10%
That tells me he's the
master of genetics.

00:29:53.720 --> 00:29:55.540 align:middle line:10%
All of these ancient
stories about

00:29:55.540 --> 00:29:58.120 align:middle line:10%
extraterrestrial
intervention in human affairs

00:29:58.120 --> 00:30:01.840 align:middle line:10%
ultimately focus on
a genetic enhancement

00:30:01.840 --> 00:30:05.830 align:middle line:10%
that was done to us, whether
it's activating the neocortex,

00:30:05.830 --> 00:30:08.630 align:middle line:10%
transmuting the body
into a higher form.

00:30:08.630 --> 00:30:11.800 align:middle line:84%
The ancient Egyptians said
Ptah was the guy that did it.

00:30:11.800 --> 00:30:15.110 align:middle line:10%
The pyramid texts that accompany
that were, in fact, dedicated

00:30:15.110 --> 00:30:17.560 align:middle line:10%
to Ptah tell us
that the reason why

00:30:17.560 --> 00:30:19.390 align:middle line:10%
was so that we
could create a more

00:30:19.390 --> 00:30:24.110 align:middle line:10%
conducive vehicle for the
soul to become a star walker.

00:30:24.110 --> 00:30:25.880 align:middle line:90%
Again, back to the Tibetans.

00:30:25.880 --> 00:30:29.330 align:middle line:84%
They teach that the ultimate
goal of all spiritual practice

00:30:29.330 --> 00:30:32.720 align:middle line:84%
is aimed at this
transfiguration, which is really

00:30:32.720 --> 00:30:36.410 align:middle line:84%
aimed at remembering our true
selves, our true nature, who

00:30:36.410 --> 00:30:37.580 align:middle line:90%
we are as beings.

00:30:37.580 --> 00:30:41.690 align:middle line:84%
Some of you might even have
had a dream or a vision,

00:30:41.690 --> 00:30:43.650 align:middle line:90%
something like this.

00:30:43.650 --> 00:30:47.930 align:middle line:84%
And the idea is that this light
self, this rainbow light body,

00:30:47.930 --> 00:30:51.267 align:middle line:84%
this ascension body, a
resurrection body, glory body--

00:30:51.267 --> 00:30:53.600 align:middle line:84%
there's so many different
terms for it-- the star walker

00:30:53.600 --> 00:30:55.860 align:middle line:90%
body is enfolded within us.

00:30:55.860 --> 00:30:59.060 align:middle line:84%
And what we have to
do is tune into it,

00:30:59.060 --> 00:31:02.400 align:middle line:84%
just acknowledge it,
reference it, study it.

00:31:02.400 --> 00:31:04.460 align:middle line:84%
And that's what we're
doing this morning,

00:31:04.460 --> 00:31:09.560 align:middle line:84%
is presenting images that help
you to begin to visualize it.

00:31:09.560 --> 00:31:12.620 align:middle line:84%
This is the White Tara, the
Buddhist goddess of compassion,

00:31:12.620 --> 00:31:15.260 align:middle line:84%
who's surrounded by this
rainbow-colored light,

00:31:15.260 --> 00:31:18.920 align:middle line:84%
indicating that she is tapped
into these higher frequencies

00:31:18.920 --> 00:31:20.690 align:middle line:90%
of love and compassion.

00:31:20.690 --> 00:31:23.880 align:middle line:84%
Again, as I said,
imagine the love

00:31:23.880 --> 00:31:26.820 align:middle line:84%
you have for a pet,
your parents, a loved

00:31:26.820 --> 00:31:29.380 align:middle line:90%
one, your children, siblings.

00:31:29.380 --> 00:31:31.950 align:middle line:84%
Multiply it by
millions, and you have

00:31:31.950 --> 00:31:33.840 align:middle line:84%
the type of love
and the frequency

00:31:33.840 --> 00:31:37.260 align:middle line:84%
that we're speaking of here
that the White Tara actually

00:31:37.260 --> 00:31:38.070 align:middle line:90%
embodies.

00:31:38.070 --> 00:31:40.560 align:middle line:10%
And all of us can embody it.

00:31:40.560 --> 00:31:42.990 align:middle line:10%
They tell us that
our new body that we

00:31:42.990 --> 00:31:46.810 align:middle line:10%
obtain as a result of following
this path will be luminous.

00:31:46.810 --> 00:31:49.720 align:middle line:10%
We will shine like the
brightness of the expanse.

00:31:49.720 --> 00:31:52.900 align:middle line:10%
We will shine like the
stars forever and ever.

00:31:52.900 --> 00:31:56.730 align:middle line:84%
This is constantly referenced in
all religious and mythological

00:31:56.730 --> 00:31:57.750 align:middle line:90%
spiritual traditions.

00:31:57.750 --> 00:32:03.210 align:middle line:84%
That we can attain this star
body or this light body.

00:32:03.210 --> 00:32:06.810 align:middle line:10%
And that each of us has
an inner core, a seed,

00:32:06.810 --> 00:32:11.860 align:middle line:10%
a spark that is capable of
manifesting this full potential.

00:32:11.860 --> 00:32:15.530 align:middle line:84%
And the question is,
how do we let it in?

00:32:15.530 --> 00:32:17.610 align:middle line:84%
And that's really
what it's about.

00:32:17.610 --> 00:32:21.050 align:middle line:10%
It's not something that
you do as much as it is

00:32:21.050 --> 00:32:23.570 align:middle line:10%
something you just are already.

00:32:23.570 --> 00:32:27.920 align:middle line:10%
And you allow it to
unfold from within you.

00:32:27.920 --> 00:32:32.000 align:middle line:10%
So maybe just take a
moment now to expand

00:32:32.000 --> 00:32:35.960 align:middle line:10%
by linking with the Buddha
here and thinking of yourself

00:32:35.960 --> 00:32:38.660 align:middle line:10%
as unfolded within
this radiant energy

00:32:38.660 --> 00:32:41.310 align:middle line:10%
field, rainbow-colored
energy field.

00:32:41.310 --> 00:32:43.640 align:middle line:84%
And just sit with
that for a moment

00:32:43.640 --> 00:32:45.590 align:middle line:90%
as we continue our presentation.

00:32:45.590 --> 00:32:49.820 align:middle line:84%
And what it would be like if
you stood up from your chair,

00:32:49.820 --> 00:32:52.310 align:middle line:84%
walked out of this room, and
everybody out in this hallway

00:32:52.310 --> 00:32:55.370 align:middle line:84%
out here noticed that
all of us were radiating

00:32:55.370 --> 00:32:57.740 align:middle line:90%
rainbow-colored light.

00:32:57.740 --> 00:33:01.050 align:middle line:84%
I think this is in part what
we're aiming at right now.

00:33:01.050 --> 00:33:03.860 align:middle line:84%
We're in a funny
zone right now, where

00:33:03.860 --> 00:33:06.120 align:middle line:84%
the rainbow is taking on
a different connotation

00:33:06.120 --> 00:33:06.920 align:middle line:90%
in our world.

00:33:06.920 --> 00:33:11.430 align:middle line:84%
The idea of trans is taking
on a different connotation.

00:33:11.430 --> 00:33:15.410 align:middle line:10%
We're ultimately aiming
at a transfiguration

00:33:15.410 --> 00:33:17.960 align:middle line:10%
into higher frequency
beings of light,

00:33:17.960 --> 00:33:20.840 align:middle line:10%
where we literally radiate
rainbow-colored light.

00:33:20.840 --> 00:33:23.490 align:middle line:10%
This is why rainbows are all
over the planet right now.

00:33:23.490 --> 00:33:26.060 align:middle line:10%
It's this human
subconscious saying, yeah,

00:33:26.060 --> 00:33:28.830 align:middle line:10%
we're aspiring to something
new and different.

00:33:28.830 --> 00:33:32.480 align:middle line:10%
We're transforming, but we don't
quite know what that form is.

00:33:32.480 --> 00:33:34.500 align:middle line:10%
We're in that
intermediate phase.

00:33:34.500 --> 00:33:37.130 align:middle line:10%
And as we begin to
fine tune that--

00:33:37.130 --> 00:33:39.890 align:middle line:10%
I know teachers,
famous teachers--

00:33:39.890 --> 00:33:41.820 align:middle line:10%
you know who they are--
meditation teachers.

00:33:41.820 --> 00:33:45.170 align:middle line:84%
Dr. Joe Dispenza--
light beings are

00:33:45.170 --> 00:33:47.490 align:middle line:90%
coming into his presentations.

00:33:47.490 --> 00:33:49.910 align:middle line:84%
People are literally
beginning to glow.

00:33:49.910 --> 00:33:54.680 align:middle line:84%
What if that was the present
reality for all of humanity?

00:33:54.680 --> 00:33:56.780 align:middle line:84%
In the next few
years, what if that

00:33:56.780 --> 00:34:00.510 align:middle line:84%
is the manifestation that shows
us we have fully transformed?

00:34:00.510 --> 00:34:02.540 align:middle line:10%
If you literally
are walking around

00:34:02.540 --> 00:34:06.110 align:middle line:10%
and you see people
exuding light,

00:34:06.110 --> 00:34:09.170 align:middle line:10%
maybe even rainbow-colored
light, in this way,

00:34:09.170 --> 00:34:11.600 align:middle line:10%
think of the
profound implications

00:34:11.600 --> 00:34:13.400 align:middle line:10%
of that in our world.

00:34:13.400 --> 00:34:16.750 align:middle line:90%
