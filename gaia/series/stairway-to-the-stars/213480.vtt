00:00:07.840 --> 00:00:11.770 align:middle line:90%


00:00:11.770 --> 00:00:14.440 align:middle line:10%
>> All right, so my
name is Jason Quitt.

00:00:14.440 --> 00:00:16.300 align:middle line:10%
And this presentation,
we're going

00:00:16.300 --> 00:00:20.380 align:middle line:10%
to go over some very
deep and mystical thing.

00:00:20.380 --> 00:00:24.790 align:middle line:10%
And I'm going to try to
simplify it the best I can.

00:00:24.790 --> 00:00:28.780 align:middle line:84%
I've been researching this
for 20 years at least.

00:00:28.780 --> 00:00:35.650 align:middle line:10%
And what I'm going to
share is the accumulation

00:00:35.650 --> 00:00:40.570 align:middle line:10%
of a lot of things that I've
worked on for many years.

00:00:40.570 --> 00:00:43.810 align:middle line:10%
So I'll start with a
quote from Manly P. Hall.

00:00:43.810 --> 00:00:48.070 align:middle line:10%
"When the human race learns to
read the language of symbolism,

00:00:48.070 --> 00:00:51.970 align:middle line:10%
a great veil will fall
from the eyes of men."

00:00:51.970 --> 00:00:55.360 align:middle line:84%
So, we're going to be delving
into a lot of symbolism.

00:00:55.360 --> 00:00:57.910 align:middle line:10%
And we're going to go look
at a lot of religious images,

00:00:57.910 --> 00:01:02.320 align:middle line:10%
and we're going to look at
even pictures from the Bible

00:01:02.320 --> 00:01:04.090 align:middle line:10%
or stories from the Bible.

00:01:04.090 --> 00:01:07.420 align:middle line:10%
And I want you to look at
it from the perspective

00:01:07.420 --> 00:01:09.730 align:middle line:10%
of symbolism of motifs.

00:01:09.730 --> 00:01:12.220 align:middle line:10%
Because once we
understand the symbolism

00:01:12.220 --> 00:01:15.370 align:middle line:10%
and once we understand what's
been hidden within certain texts

00:01:15.370 --> 00:01:19.840 align:middle line:10%
and images, another story
starts to show itself.

00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:23.050 align:middle line:10%
And these are the stories that
are taught in secret societies.

00:01:23.050 --> 00:01:26.785 align:middle line:10%
These are the stories that
are underneath what we know.

00:01:26.785 --> 00:01:32.270 align:middle line:90%


00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:35.660 align:middle line:84%
So, what if you were to discover
a secret knowledge hidden

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:39.080 align:middle line:84%
in symbolism that has been
passed down through civilization

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:42.260 align:middle line:84%
building cultures found
throughout the entire world,

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:44.540 align:middle line:84%
obscured from the
general population,

00:01:44.540 --> 00:01:48.080 align:middle line:84%
only to be taught through
initiation, secret orders,

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:52.430 align:middle line:84%
and ancestral wisdom keepers;
thousands of years of symbolism

00:01:52.430 --> 00:01:55.670 align:middle line:84%
hidden in plain sight through
the great works of art,

00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:59.120 align:middle line:84%
ancient artifacts, religious
texts, myths, tools,

00:01:59.120 --> 00:02:02.240 align:middle line:84%
and architecture, spanning
our known history,

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:04.970 align:middle line:84%
only accessible to those
that hold the keys, that

00:02:04.970 --> 00:02:07.040 align:middle line:90%
decipher their true intentions?

00:02:07.040 --> 00:02:09.620 align:middle line:84%
And this gnosis, this
knowledge, is actually

00:02:09.620 --> 00:02:12.380 align:middle line:84%
a star language that
can be traced back

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:17.360 align:middle line:84%
in time, unbroken since the
end of the last Ice Age--

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:20.120 align:middle line:84%
I would even say
12,000 years ago--

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:23.930 align:middle line:84%
protected by our
remote ancestors

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:28.430 align:middle line:84%
for future generations, for us
to understand this knowledge.

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:29.930 align:middle line:90%
Because this is our birthright.

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:34.050 align:middle line:90%
This is our astral Genesis.

00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:36.750 align:middle line:84%
So we're going to get
into esoteric wisdom,

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:40.380 align:middle line:84%
science of symbolism; creation
myths, and the hidden motifs

00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:44.370 align:middle line:84%
of astro-theology; rediscovering
the solar code, angles,

00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:50.470 align:middle line:84%
and ratios; and evidence of a
prehistoric worldwide knowledge.

00:02:50.470 --> 00:02:54.630 align:middle line:84%
How many of you have
heard of astro-theology?

00:02:54.630 --> 00:02:56.190 align:middle line:90%
OK, perfect.

00:02:56.190 --> 00:02:57.700 align:middle line:90%
Perfect.

00:02:57.700 --> 00:03:00.900 align:middle line:10%
The astro-theology
is creation, myth,

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:03.060 align:middle line:10%
or myths that are
based on the movements

00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:05.800 align:middle line:10%
of the stars in the skies.

00:03:05.800 --> 00:03:08.260 align:middle line:10%
And I'm going to start
with the Tower of Babel,

00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:10.800 align:middle line:10%
because I think we're
all familiar with this.

00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:13.680 align:middle line:84%
And this is from the
Bible, Genesis 11.

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:17.190 align:middle line:84%
It says, "Now the whole
world had one language

00:03:17.190 --> 00:03:18.970 align:middle line:90%
and a common speech.

00:03:18.970 --> 00:03:21.570 align:middle line:84%
Come, let us build
ourselves a city,

00:03:21.570 --> 00:03:24.300 align:middle line:84%
with a tower that
reaches to the heavens,

00:03:24.300 --> 00:03:27.310 align:middle line:84%
so that we may make
a name for ourselves.

00:03:27.310 --> 00:03:30.070 align:middle line:84%
If as one people speaking
the same language,

00:03:30.070 --> 00:03:33.430 align:middle line:84%
they have begun to do this,
then nothing they plan to do

00:03:33.430 --> 00:03:35.200 align:middle line:90%
will be impossible for them.

00:03:35.200 --> 00:03:39.080 align:middle line:84%
Come, let us go down and
confuse their languages,

00:03:39.080 --> 00:03:41.530 align:middle line:84%
so they will not
understand each other.

00:03:41.530 --> 00:03:45.650 align:middle line:84%
So the Lord scattered them
from there all over the earth,

00:03:45.650 --> 00:03:49.430 align:middle line:84%
and they stopped
building the city."

00:03:49.430 --> 00:03:51.890 align:middle line:84%
So the tower follows
the same motif

00:03:51.890 --> 00:03:54.800 align:middle line:84%
as the fall from
the Garden of Eden.

00:03:54.800 --> 00:03:57.540 align:middle line:84%
Once man and woman ate
the forbidden fruit,

00:03:57.540 --> 00:03:59.540 align:middle line:84%
they gained knowledge
of good and evil.

00:03:59.540 --> 00:04:01.820 align:middle line:84%
If they then ate
the fruit of life,

00:04:01.820 --> 00:04:04.250 align:middle line:84%
they would live forever
and be like a god.

00:04:04.250 --> 00:04:07.370 align:middle line:84%
To prevent humans from reaching
this godlike potential,

00:04:07.370 --> 00:04:09.320 align:middle line:84%
they are kicked
out of the garden.

00:04:09.320 --> 00:04:11.130 align:middle line:84%
The tower follows
the same theme.

00:04:11.130 --> 00:04:14.670 align:middle line:84%
Humans ascend the tower to
reach the heavens and God.

00:04:14.670 --> 00:04:18.390 align:middle line:84%
God prevents that
from happening.

00:04:18.390 --> 00:04:22.560 align:middle line:84%
"Babel" in Hebrew
translates to "confuse."

00:04:22.560 --> 00:04:25.800 align:middle line:84%
And tracking the etymology
of the word "Babel"

00:04:25.800 --> 00:04:29.700 align:middle line:84%
in ancient Akkadian, we get the
word 'Bab-ilu," which translates

00:04:29.700 --> 00:04:32.200 align:middle line:90%
to "gate of the gods."

00:04:32.200 --> 00:04:35.520 align:middle line:84%
I need you to remember this
term, the "gate of the gods."

00:04:35.520 --> 00:04:39.990 align:middle line:84%
This is the source of both the
words "Babel" and "Babylon."

00:04:39.990 --> 00:04:43.700 align:middle line:84%
And we hear a lot about
Babylon in the Bible, too.

00:04:43.700 --> 00:04:47.150 align:middle line:84%
The tower represents the
Sumerian ziggurats tower

00:04:47.150 --> 00:04:50.660 align:middle line:84%
of the gods, connecting
heaven and earth, which

00:04:50.660 --> 00:04:53.540 align:middle line:84%
are the astrological
observations which

00:04:53.540 --> 00:04:56.360 align:middle line:84%
were used as astrological
observatories

00:04:56.360 --> 00:05:01.160 align:middle line:84%
and a potent symbol of
ascending to the heavens.

00:05:01.160 --> 00:05:03.500 align:middle line:10%
So I'll just pose this question.

00:05:03.500 --> 00:05:08.180 align:middle line:10%
Was there a single language that
was spoken by our ancestors that

00:05:08.180 --> 00:05:12.410 align:middle line:10%
was lost when human populations
were scattered around the world

00:05:12.410 --> 00:05:15.110 align:middle line:10%
after a flood or a cataclysm?

00:05:15.110 --> 00:05:17.750 align:middle line:84%
Is there evidence of
this hidden language

00:05:17.750 --> 00:05:21.110 align:middle line:84%
throughout ancient cultures,
throughout the world?

00:05:21.110 --> 00:05:24.440 align:middle line:84%
Not just in the Mediterranean,
but through the entire world,

00:05:24.440 --> 00:05:27.410 align:middle line:84%
does this language
exist, a language

00:05:27.410 --> 00:05:29.930 align:middle line:84%
that gave humans knowledge
to achieve anything

00:05:29.930 --> 00:05:31.400 align:middle line:90%
they set their minds to?

00:05:31.400 --> 00:05:33.740 align:middle line:84%
And this is the
quote from the Bible,

00:05:33.740 --> 00:05:36.780 align:middle line:84%
"That nothing they plan to do
will be impossible for them."

00:05:36.780 --> 00:05:38.930 align:middle line:10%
Once they knew this
language, nothing

00:05:38.930 --> 00:05:40.650 align:middle line:10%
would be impossible to them.

00:05:40.650 --> 00:05:43.375 align:middle line:10%
And this was why they were
scattered around the earth.

00:05:43.375 --> 00:05:47.060 align:middle line:90%


00:05:47.060 --> 00:05:50.360 align:middle line:10%
So the science of
symbolism, mystical teaching

00:05:50.360 --> 00:05:53.720 align:middle line:10%
passed down through the ages
of oppression, persecution,

00:05:53.720 --> 00:05:55.420 align:middle line:10%
and gnosis--

00:05:55.420 --> 00:05:58.870 align:middle line:10%
so I'm going to start with
Leonardo da Vinci, because this

00:05:58.870 --> 00:06:01.090 align:middle line:10%
is very recent in our history.

00:06:01.090 --> 00:06:04.510 align:middle line:90%
And most people will know this.

00:06:04.510 --> 00:06:07.160 align:middle line:10%
Because he hid things
in his greatest works.

00:06:07.160 --> 00:06:10.930 align:middle line:10%
So here is "The Last Supper"
of Leonardo da Vinci.

00:06:10.930 --> 00:06:14.020 align:middle line:10%
And what I want to tell
you, that this is not just

00:06:14.020 --> 00:06:17.320 align:middle line:10%
a picture of Jesus
and the apostles.

00:06:17.320 --> 00:06:21.580 align:middle line:10%
This is a picture that is
veiled in so much symbolism

00:06:21.580 --> 00:06:24.130 align:middle line:10%
that I could probably
do a two-hour talk just

00:06:24.130 --> 00:06:26.560 align:middle line:10%
on this painting alone.

00:06:26.560 --> 00:06:29.950 align:middle line:10%
What I'm going to just
say is that this picture,

00:06:29.950 --> 00:06:35.200 align:middle line:10%
or this painting, is actually
the 12 constellations,

00:06:35.200 --> 00:06:37.420 align:middle line:10%
and Jesus is the sun.

00:06:37.420 --> 00:06:41.160 align:middle line:10%
So this is pastoral
theology in a painting.

00:06:41.160 --> 00:06:43.890 align:middle line:10%
And the way Leonardo
da Vinci did

00:06:43.890 --> 00:06:46.890 align:middle line:10%
this is actually so
ingenious, that he actually

00:06:46.890 --> 00:06:51.870 align:middle line:10%
put the geometry of the
stars into the painting.

00:06:51.870 --> 00:06:53.650 align:middle line:10%
And nobody has
figured this out yet.

00:06:53.650 --> 00:06:55.950 align:middle line:10%
So you're going to be
the first to know this.

00:06:55.950 --> 00:07:00.030 align:middle line:10%
So if you look at Jesus, he's
sitting right in the center.

00:07:00.030 --> 00:07:05.060 align:middle line:10%
And if you trace around him,
he's a perfect 52-degree

00:07:05.060 --> 00:07:08.360 align:middle line:10%
pyramid, just like
the pyramids of Egypt.

00:07:08.360 --> 00:07:11.490 align:middle line:84%
So let's zoom in
here and cut him out.

00:07:11.490 --> 00:07:16.310 align:middle line:84%
And as you can see, he has one
eye closed and one eye right

00:07:16.310 --> 00:07:17.440 align:middle line:90%
in the center.

00:07:17.440 --> 00:07:18.300 align:middle line:90%
So look at this.

00:07:18.300 --> 00:07:21.980 align:middle line:84%
It's the eye at the
top of the pyramid.

00:07:21.980 --> 00:07:26.240 align:middle line:84%
This goes back to very ancient
symbolism of the eye of Horus

00:07:26.240 --> 00:07:27.390 align:middle line:90%
and the Eye of Providence.

00:07:27.390 --> 00:07:30.830 align:middle line:84%
It's also the eye at the top of
the pyramid of the dollar bill.

00:07:30.830 --> 00:07:32.820 align:middle line:90%
These are very ancient symbols.

00:07:32.820 --> 00:07:37.310 align:middle line:10%
This goes back to Egypt and I
would say, even before Egypt,

00:07:37.310 --> 00:07:39.770 align:middle line:10%
as I'll show you.

00:07:39.770 --> 00:07:43.950 align:middle line:10%
So back to the painting, I'll
just show you the geometry here.

00:07:43.950 --> 00:07:47.600 align:middle line:84%
You see how the
apostles around him,

00:07:47.600 --> 00:07:53.170 align:middle line:84%
there is a 45-degree
perfect square.

00:07:53.170 --> 00:07:57.490 align:middle line:84%
From Jesus' eye is set
the center of perspective.

00:07:57.490 --> 00:08:03.780 align:middle line:84%
So from the eye, the entire
painting is done at 26 degrees.

00:08:03.780 --> 00:08:05.875 align:middle line:84%
Now, this is where
it gets interesting.

00:08:05.875 --> 00:08:09.270 align:middle line:84%
And this is where we start
getting the code that Leonardo

00:08:09.270 --> 00:08:11.130 align:middle line:90%
da Vinci was putting in here.

00:08:11.130 --> 00:08:12.780 align:middle line:84%
If you take the
edge of the table

00:08:12.780 --> 00:08:15.060 align:middle line:84%
and go up over
the apostles' arm,

00:08:15.060 --> 00:08:16.810 align:middle line:84%
you can see there's
a slope there.

00:08:16.810 --> 00:08:19.410 align:middle line:90%
It's at 23.5 degrees.

00:08:19.410 --> 00:08:23.950 align:middle line:84%
23.5 degrees is the
tilt of the Earth.

00:08:23.950 --> 00:08:28.110 align:middle line:10%
It's the Tropic of Cancer
and the Tropic of Capricorn.

00:08:28.110 --> 00:08:32.929 align:middle line:10%
At 23.5 degrees, that is
the secret of the seasons.

00:08:32.929 --> 00:08:36.480 align:middle line:10%
The seasons of the Earth
change at 23.5 degrees.

00:08:36.480 --> 00:08:39.030 align:middle line:10%
So if you counted
the constellations,

00:08:39.030 --> 00:08:41.250 align:middle line:10%
right where this curve
is in the center here,

00:08:41.250 --> 00:08:44.610 align:middle line:10%
that is 23 degrees of Cancer.

00:08:44.610 --> 00:08:48.310 align:middle line:10%
And over here, it's 23.5
degrees of Capricorn.

00:08:48.310 --> 00:08:51.810 align:middle line:10%
So he's putting astrology
and the motion of the planet

00:08:51.810 --> 00:08:53.420 align:middle line:10%
directly into his painting.

00:08:53.420 --> 00:08:57.840 align:middle line:90%


00:08:57.840 --> 00:09:00.550 align:middle line:84%
Now, behind him
is another symbol.

00:09:00.550 --> 00:09:02.850 align:middle line:84%
It's the three windows
or the two windows

00:09:02.850 --> 00:09:07.990 align:middle line:84%
and one door, which is
a very ancient symbol.

00:09:07.990 --> 00:09:10.040 align:middle line:84%
It's called the
Gate of the Gods.

00:09:10.040 --> 00:09:12.600 align:middle line:84%
Remember, Babylon is
called Gate of the Gods?

00:09:12.600 --> 00:09:16.010 align:middle line:84%
These are very ancient
symbols of these doorways.

00:09:16.010 --> 00:09:20.590 align:middle line:10%
And the doorways represented
the doorways of the seasons,

00:09:20.590 --> 00:09:23.950 align:middle line:10%
of the solstices
and the equinoxes,

00:09:23.950 --> 00:09:30.020 align:middle line:10%
as the sun passed through
these houses of the year.

00:09:30.020 --> 00:09:32.620 align:middle line:10%
And you can see this
all over the planet.

00:09:32.620 --> 00:09:34.910 align:middle line:10%
They have architecture
made directly

00:09:34.910 --> 00:09:37.400 align:middle line:10%
for this, where at
the winter solstice,

00:09:37.400 --> 00:09:40.835 align:middle line:10%
at Karnak, it goes through
the gates; Cambodia,

00:09:40.835 --> 00:09:44.330 align:middle line:10%
it goes right on
top of the tower.

00:09:44.330 --> 00:09:47.060 align:middle line:10%
Even in Japan and
Mexico, they have all

00:09:47.060 --> 00:09:49.400 align:middle line:10%
built structures
exactly the same

00:09:49.400 --> 00:09:53.340 align:middle line:10%
to show you the three
windows and the door.

00:09:53.340 --> 00:09:58.550 align:middle line:84%
So this is the movement
and tilt of the Earth.

00:09:58.550 --> 00:10:01.280 align:middle line:90%
In Petra-- we all know Petra.

00:10:01.280 --> 00:10:04.650 align:middle line:84%
But what people are
not really taught

00:10:04.650 --> 00:10:07.590 align:middle line:90%
is that it is also a calendar.

00:10:07.590 --> 00:10:12.090 align:middle line:10%
So as the sun passes through
the doorway in Petra,

00:10:12.090 --> 00:10:15.130 align:middle line:10%
it goes on to the altars inside.

00:10:15.130 --> 00:10:17.070 align:middle line:10%
And as it passes
in the altar, it

00:10:17.070 --> 00:10:20.130 align:middle line:10%
shows the winter
solstice, equinox,

00:10:20.130 --> 00:10:22.050 align:middle line:10%
and the summer solstice.

00:10:22.050 --> 00:10:24.120 align:middle line:10%
But what is not
really told about

00:10:24.120 --> 00:10:29.710 align:middle line:10%
is on the opposite side of the
mountain during the equinox,

00:10:29.710 --> 00:10:33.910 align:middle line:10%
a lion's head shadow
appears on the rocks.

00:10:33.910 --> 00:10:40.250 align:middle line:10%
So on the equinox, a lion or a
jaguar's head is on the rocks.

00:10:40.250 --> 00:10:41.740 align:middle line:90%
So this is Petra, Jordan.

00:10:41.740 --> 00:10:45.670 align:middle line:90%


00:10:45.670 --> 00:10:49.900 align:middle line:84%
This is Superstition
Mountain in Arizona.

00:10:49.900 --> 00:10:53.440 align:middle line:84%
On the equinox,
the mountain puts

00:10:53.440 --> 00:10:56.400 align:middle line:90%
the shape of a Jaguar shadow.

00:10:56.400 --> 00:11:01.500 align:middle line:84%
So the same technology, the
same motif, the same symbolism,

00:11:01.500 --> 00:11:05.970 align:middle line:84%
happens in Arizona
and in Petra, Jordan,

00:11:05.970 --> 00:11:09.240 align:middle line:90%
both thousands of years old.

00:11:09.240 --> 00:11:10.235 align:middle line:90%
How is this possible?

00:11:10.235 --> 00:11:14.140 align:middle line:90%


00:11:14.140 --> 00:11:20.050 align:middle line:84%
So back to Jesus,
this is all symbolism.

00:11:20.050 --> 00:11:24.330 align:middle line:84%
You can see his face is turned
in one direction, right?

00:11:24.330 --> 00:11:26.890 align:middle line:90%
It's facing a certain direction.

00:11:26.890 --> 00:11:29.950 align:middle line:10%
This has to do with the
trinity, the trinity

00:11:29.950 --> 00:11:33.070 align:middle line:10%
of the suns, the winter
solstice, equinox,

00:11:33.070 --> 00:11:34.750 align:middle line:10%
and summer solstice.

00:11:34.750 --> 00:11:38.020 align:middle line:10%
And this was a big
theme in medieval times.

00:11:38.020 --> 00:11:41.930 align:middle line:10%
And you could see around Jesus,
the three faces of Jesus,

00:11:41.930 --> 00:11:46.330 align:middle line:10%
there are the four
animals, the four angels,

00:11:46.330 --> 00:11:48.100 align:middle line:10%
or whatever they called them.

00:11:48.100 --> 00:11:54.950 align:middle line:10%
And it is an eagle, a
man, a bull, and a tiger.

00:11:54.950 --> 00:11:57.730 align:middle line:10%
And we know about these
animals because it's

00:11:57.730 --> 00:12:01.000 align:middle line:10%
in the story of Ezekiel.

00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:05.620 align:middle line:10%
And that's the four
angels, having four faces,

00:12:05.620 --> 00:12:07.840 align:middle line:10%
looking out at the
cardinal directions.

00:12:07.840 --> 00:12:11.260 align:middle line:10%
They have a face of a man,
a lion, an ox, and an eagle.

00:12:11.260 --> 00:12:16.840 align:middle line:10%
These are references
to the zodiac.

00:12:16.840 --> 00:12:20.360 align:middle line:84%
They are the cardinal
directions of the zodiac.

00:12:20.360 --> 00:12:22.580 align:middle line:90%
That's the wheels within wheels.

00:12:22.580 --> 00:12:23.990 align:middle line:10%
It's not a UFO.

00:12:23.990 --> 00:12:25.170 align:middle line:10%
It is the zodiac.

00:12:25.170 --> 00:12:27.710 align:middle line:10%
It's the movement of
the planetary bodies,

00:12:27.710 --> 00:12:30.670 align:middle line:10%
are the wheels within wheels.

00:12:30.670 --> 00:12:33.070 align:middle line:84%
And this is what
they're showing you.

00:12:33.070 --> 00:12:36.110 align:middle line:84%
They're showing you
the cardinal points.

00:12:36.110 --> 00:12:40.960 align:middle line:84%
You can see Scorpio,
which is the eagle.

00:12:40.960 --> 00:12:42.890 align:middle line:90%
You have the bull.

00:12:42.890 --> 00:12:47.570 align:middle line:84%
You have the man, which
is Aquarius, and the lion.

00:12:47.570 --> 00:12:52.380 align:middle line:10%
This is the zodiac, the
wheels within the wheels.

00:12:52.380 --> 00:12:54.930 align:middle line:10%
So what Leonardo
da Vinci was trying

00:12:54.930 --> 00:12:59.820 align:middle line:10%
to show us in this
picture was actually this.

00:12:59.820 --> 00:13:02.220 align:middle line:90%
This is the code.

00:13:02.220 --> 00:13:06.150 align:middle line:84%
And it shows the
movement of the Earth

00:13:06.150 --> 00:13:08.670 align:middle line:84%
and the sun from
the spring equinox,

00:13:08.670 --> 00:13:11.640 align:middle line:84%
solstice, equinox, to
the winter solstice,

00:13:11.640 --> 00:13:15.530 align:middle line:84%
as it moves through
the constellations.

00:13:15.530 --> 00:13:19.030 align:middle line:10%
So they knew this a
couple hundred years ago.

00:13:19.030 --> 00:13:19.830 align:middle line:10%
It's not too bad.

00:13:19.830 --> 00:13:22.570 align:middle line:10%
But I'm going to show you they
knew this 12,000 years ago,

00:13:22.570 --> 00:13:24.290 align:middle line:10%
exactly this.

00:13:24.290 --> 00:13:25.560 align:middle line:10%
So how did they know this.

00:13:25.560 --> 00:13:29.320 align:middle line:10%
12,000 years ago?

00:13:29.320 --> 00:13:32.130 align:middle line:10%
So this is what it looks like.

00:13:32.130 --> 00:13:34.450 align:middle line:84%
You have the Milky
Way galaxy, and you

00:13:34.450 --> 00:13:36.320 align:middle line:90%
have the zodiac, the signs.

00:13:36.320 --> 00:13:41.010 align:middle line:84%
And that line is the sun
moving through the signs.

00:13:41.010 --> 00:13:45.720 align:middle line:10%
And the Milky Way, it's a plane.

00:13:45.720 --> 00:13:47.200 align:middle line:10%
It's flat.

00:13:47.200 --> 00:13:50.340 align:middle line:10%
The reason it has this
serpent-like shape

00:13:50.340 --> 00:13:52.360 align:middle line:10%
is because the Earth tilts.

00:13:52.360 --> 00:13:55.480 align:middle line:10%
So over the course of the
year, the Earth is tilting.

00:13:55.480 --> 00:13:58.110 align:middle line:10%
So from our
observational point, it

00:13:58.110 --> 00:14:03.420 align:middle line:10%
looks like the Milky Way is
this serpent in space going

00:14:03.420 --> 00:14:04.886 align:middle line:10%
through the constellations.

00:14:04.886 --> 00:14:07.700 align:middle line:10%


00:14:07.700 --> 00:14:09.650 align:middle line:10%
So this is what it looks like.

00:14:09.650 --> 00:14:12.170 align:middle line:84%
You have the Earth
at the equinox.

00:14:12.170 --> 00:14:15.900 align:middle line:90%
Earth is straight, 0 degrees.

00:14:15.900 --> 00:14:19.140 align:middle line:84%
And then for the summer
solstice, it turns.

00:14:19.140 --> 00:14:21.210 align:middle line:90%
23.5 degrees.

00:14:21.210 --> 00:14:23.910 align:middle line:10%
And then at the winter solstice,
it comes back to the equinox,

00:14:23.910 --> 00:14:26.370 align:middle line:10%
and then it goes
another 23.5 degrees.

00:14:26.370 --> 00:14:28.910 align:middle line:10%
And it creates this
kind of geometry.

00:14:28.910 --> 00:14:30.840 align:middle line:10%
So this is the natural
geometry that the Earth

00:14:30.840 --> 00:14:32.850 align:middle line:10%
turns every single year.

00:14:32.850 --> 00:14:37.590 align:middle line:10%
And it looks exactly like what
the ancient Sanskrits would

00:14:37.590 --> 00:14:40.930 align:middle line:10%
talk about as the swastika,
which represents the solar deity

00:14:40.930 --> 00:14:43.300 align:middle line:10%
Surya, the sun of prosperity.

00:14:43.300 --> 00:14:45.990 align:middle line:10%
So you could say
the sun from spring

00:14:45.990 --> 00:14:50.070 align:middle line:10%
to summer is the sun of
prosperity, gives us life.

00:14:50.070 --> 00:14:53.460 align:middle line:10%
And then you have
the other swastika,

00:14:53.460 --> 00:14:55.350 align:middle line:10%
which represents
the goddess Kali,

00:14:55.350 --> 00:14:58.290 align:middle line:10%
which is the sun of destruction,
which goes from the autumn

00:14:58.290 --> 00:15:00.460 align:middle line:10%
equinox to the winter.

00:15:00.460 --> 00:15:02.030 align:middle line:10%
It kills the Earth.

00:15:02.030 --> 00:15:04.900 align:middle line:10%


00:15:04.900 --> 00:15:10.160 align:middle line:10%
So here is a picture of Anu, the
god of heavens, from Sumeria.

00:15:10.160 --> 00:15:12.580 align:middle line:84%
And I want you to pay close
attention to the symbol,

00:15:12.580 --> 00:15:16.320 align:middle line:90%
the cross around his neck.

00:15:16.320 --> 00:15:20.960 align:middle line:84%
So if we take the geometry
of the movement of the Earth,

00:15:20.960 --> 00:15:27.100 align:middle line:84%
and we place it over the cross,
you get the same geometry.

00:15:27.100 --> 00:15:31.210 align:middle line:10%
So did the Sumerians know
about the tilt of the Earth

00:15:31.210 --> 00:15:35.800 align:middle line:10%
and the seasons 6,000 years ago?

00:15:35.800 --> 00:15:38.010 align:middle line:10%
And did they hide
it in their art?

00:15:38.010 --> 00:15:41.530 align:middle line:90%


00:15:41.530 --> 00:15:44.530 align:middle line:10%
Today, we have many
artists that paint Jesus.

00:15:44.530 --> 00:15:46.540 align:middle line:10%
And this one I
wanted to show you

00:15:46.540 --> 00:15:49.300 align:middle line:10%
because it has something
very interesting on it, which

00:15:49.300 --> 00:15:55.090 align:middle line:10%
is called the globulus crucifix,
which is the orb and cross.

00:15:55.090 --> 00:15:58.160 align:middle line:10%
And this is in many paintings.

00:15:58.160 --> 00:16:01.010 align:middle line:10%
And its solar
symbolism, they say

00:16:01.010 --> 00:16:05.190 align:middle line:10%
it's Christ's sun's
domination over the world.

00:16:05.190 --> 00:16:07.730 align:middle line:10%
Now, if you draw the
geometry over this,

00:16:07.730 --> 00:16:09.590 align:middle line:10%
you get something
really interesting.

00:16:09.590 --> 00:16:11.540 align:middle line:10%
From the base of the
cross through these two

00:16:11.540 --> 00:16:13.040 align:middle line:10%
circles at the end
of the cross, you

00:16:13.040 --> 00:16:18.680 align:middle line:10%
get 23.5 degrees, exactly
the same as the curve

00:16:18.680 --> 00:16:20.420 align:middle line:10%
or the tilt of the Earth.

00:16:20.420 --> 00:16:25.730 align:middle line:10%
And then from the top
down, it's 45-degree angle.

00:16:25.730 --> 00:16:29.360 align:middle line:10%
We start to see very similar
geometry with the masons,

00:16:29.360 --> 00:16:31.080 align:middle line:10%
don't we?

00:16:31.080 --> 00:16:33.780 align:middle line:10%
Yes, this is very ancient.

00:16:33.780 --> 00:16:37.410 align:middle line:10%
But they're hiding
it in plain sight.

00:16:37.410 --> 00:16:44.010 align:middle line:84%
So here's this guy, and he's
holding a real one in his hand.

00:16:44.010 --> 00:16:46.780 align:middle line:10%
And I just wanted to
see if it was the same.

00:16:46.780 --> 00:16:51.510 align:middle line:84%
And it was exactly the same,
23.5 degrees and 45 degrees.

00:16:51.510 --> 00:16:53.500 align:middle line:10%
So it's right in our faces.

00:16:53.500 --> 00:16:55.170 align:middle line:10%
The symbology is
right in our faces,

00:16:55.170 --> 00:16:59.940 align:middle line:10%
but nobody teaches about-- what
does the real symbolism mean?

00:16:59.940 --> 00:17:03.800 align:middle line:10%
You have to be initiated
into knowing these things.

00:17:03.800 --> 00:17:07.099 align:middle line:84%
So the yearly cycle of the
sun through the 12 houses

00:17:07.099 --> 00:17:11.089 align:middle line:84%
of the constellations is
the astro-theological path

00:17:11.089 --> 00:17:13.790 align:middle line:84%
of the journey of the
soul through birth, death,

00:17:13.790 --> 00:17:18.200 align:middle line:84%
resurrection, and
ascension to heaven.

00:17:18.200 --> 00:17:20.119 align:middle line:84%
So here's from the
"Book of the Dead."

00:17:20.119 --> 00:17:23.000 align:middle line:84%
And everybody knows the "Book
of the Dead," very famous.

00:17:23.000 --> 00:17:25.940 align:middle line:84%
And this is an illustration
from the "Book of the Dead"

00:17:25.940 --> 00:17:27.900 align:middle line:90%
of the Singer of Amun.

00:17:27.900 --> 00:17:30.440 align:middle line:84%
So the Singer of Amun
is that lady there

00:17:30.440 --> 00:17:33.690 align:middle line:84%
holding the three
eyes in her hands.

00:17:33.690 --> 00:17:39.390 align:middle line:10%
And I want to show you this from
the astro-theological point.

00:17:39.390 --> 00:17:43.260 align:middle line:84%
You have Isis here standing
behind this singer,

00:17:43.260 --> 00:17:48.790 align:middle line:84%
and she's holding a strand
of wheat in her hand.

00:17:48.790 --> 00:17:53.350 align:middle line:10%
Now, if you know astrology, the
woman with the wheat in her hand

00:17:53.350 --> 00:17:55.920 align:middle line:10%
is Virgo, the Virgin.

00:17:55.920 --> 00:17:59.320 align:middle line:10%
This is where we get
the Virgin Mary from.

00:17:59.320 --> 00:18:01.500 align:middle line:90%
It's Virgo.

00:18:01.500 --> 00:18:07.480 align:middle line:84%
The scales, if you look at the
zodiac, the scales are Libra.

00:18:07.480 --> 00:18:10.450 align:middle line:84%
The scales of judgment
between light and dark.

00:18:10.450 --> 00:18:19.490 align:middle line:10%
What happens in Leo is we go
through the autumn equinox.

00:18:19.490 --> 00:18:25.380 align:middle line:10%
It's when the light on the
Earth is 12 hours equal.

00:18:25.380 --> 00:18:28.350 align:middle line:10%
So it's 12 hours of
light, 12 hours of dark.

00:18:28.350 --> 00:18:32.480 align:middle line:10%
And then after Libra, you
get bit by the scorpion,

00:18:32.480 --> 00:18:35.210 align:middle line:10%
and you die, the Scorpio.

00:18:35.210 --> 00:18:38.000 align:middle line:10%
And then darkness
takes over the light,

00:18:38.000 --> 00:18:40.490 align:middle line:10%
and you go into
winter, into death.

00:18:40.490 --> 00:18:43.600 align:middle line:10%
This is all
astro-theological themes.

00:18:43.600 --> 00:18:46.390 align:middle line:84%
You have Anubis,
which is Canis Major.

00:18:46.390 --> 00:18:49.990 align:middle line:84%
We know the famous star
Sirius is from there.

00:18:49.990 --> 00:18:52.740 align:middle line:84%
We have the bull's leg,
which is put up on the side.

00:18:52.740 --> 00:18:56.770 align:middle line:84%
Now the bull's leg is actually
the constellation Boötes.

00:18:56.770 --> 00:19:00.260 align:middle line:90%
And Osiris is Orion.

00:19:00.260 --> 00:19:03.380 align:middle line:10%
And what's really interesting
is during winter time,

00:19:03.380 --> 00:19:07.310 align:middle line:10%
if you look at the constellation
Boötes, during the winter,

00:19:07.310 --> 00:19:11.090 align:middle line:10%
the constellation goes
from the upright position

00:19:11.090 --> 00:19:13.980 align:middle line:10%
to its side in winter.

00:19:13.980 --> 00:19:17.360 align:middle line:10%
So it's going on
the altar, Altares.

00:19:17.360 --> 00:19:18.450 align:middle line:10%
It's another thing.

00:19:18.450 --> 00:19:22.290 align:middle line:10%
It goes on the altar in the sky.

00:19:22.290 --> 00:19:27.520 align:middle line:10%
So all of these images
are based on the stars.

00:19:27.520 --> 00:19:29.890 align:middle line:10%
And so they would teach one
knowledge to the people,

00:19:29.890 --> 00:19:32.140 align:middle line:10%
but they would teach another
knowledge to the pharaohs

00:19:32.140 --> 00:19:36.130 align:middle line:10%
to keep this knowledge going
down for thousands of years.

00:19:36.130 --> 00:19:38.860 align:middle line:10%
Here is Saint Gregory
of Tours of France,

00:19:38.860 --> 00:19:41.560 align:middle line:10%
known as the father
of French history.

00:19:41.560 --> 00:19:43.810 align:middle line:10%
And he wrote something
really interesting

00:19:43.810 --> 00:19:46.600 align:middle line:10%
that I want to share with you,
because it unravels a big rabbit

00:19:46.600 --> 00:19:47.470 align:middle line:10%
hole.

00:19:47.470 --> 00:19:50.380 align:middle line:10%
He wrote about the
constellation Cygnus,

00:19:50.380 --> 00:19:52.750 align:middle line:10%
which is the Great
Northern Cross in the sky.

00:19:52.750 --> 00:19:54.520 align:middle line:10%
It's very easy to see.

00:19:54.520 --> 00:19:56.440 align:middle line:10%
And he referred to
the constellation

00:19:56.440 --> 00:20:01.240 align:middle line:10%
of Delphinus and Lyra
as alpha and omega,

00:20:01.240 --> 00:20:04.720 align:middle line:10%
which creates the symbol
of the alpha and omega

00:20:04.720 --> 00:20:06.120 align:middle line:10%
on either side of the cross.

00:20:06.120 --> 00:20:08.790 align:middle line:90%


00:20:08.790 --> 00:20:12.630 align:middle line:84%
So there's the cross with
the alpha and omega hanging

00:20:12.630 --> 00:20:14.070 align:middle line:90%
from the cross.

00:20:14.070 --> 00:20:16.660 align:middle line:84%
And here's the
Northern Cross, Cygnus.

00:20:16.660 --> 00:20:20.770 align:middle line:84%
And underneath the cross,
you have Delphinus and Lyra,

00:20:20.770 --> 00:20:26.680 align:middle line:90%
two constellations under Cygnus.

00:20:26.680 --> 00:20:29.440 align:middle line:84%
Doesn't that look
exactly like the cross

00:20:29.440 --> 00:20:31.730 align:middle line:90%
with the two alpha and omega?

00:20:31.730 --> 00:20:35.530 align:middle line:84%
And if you go down further
of the "Book of the Dead,"

00:20:35.530 --> 00:20:38.860 align:middle line:84%
you have the cross,
which is the scales,

00:20:38.860 --> 00:20:41.000 align:middle line:90%
with the heart and the feather.

00:20:41.000 --> 00:20:42.450 align:middle line:90%
Delphinus and Lyra.

00:20:42.450 --> 00:20:45.350 align:middle line:90%


00:20:45.350 --> 00:20:49.520 align:middle line:84%
And what's very interesting
is Delphinus has another name.

00:20:49.520 --> 00:20:52.250 align:middle line:90%
It's called Job's Coffin.

00:20:52.250 --> 00:20:57.120 align:middle line:10%
And nobody remembers why
they call it Job's Coffin.

00:20:57.120 --> 00:21:00.500 align:middle line:10%
And the story of Job is
actually the oldest story

00:21:00.500 --> 00:21:01.800 align:middle line:10%
of biblical texts.

00:21:01.800 --> 00:21:06.480 align:middle line:10%
It's actually predates the
story of Genesis by 400 years.

00:21:06.480 --> 00:21:10.040 align:middle line:10%
So it's the oldest text
in the Bible, is Job.

00:21:10.040 --> 00:21:13.190 align:middle line:84%
And the theme of
the story is God

00:21:13.190 --> 00:21:18.380 align:middle line:84%
is testing Job's faith
with Satan, the adversary.

00:21:18.380 --> 00:21:23.060 align:middle line:84%
That's all that means, and
suggests that Job only serves

00:21:23.060 --> 00:21:25.080 align:middle line:90%
God because he is protected.

00:21:25.080 --> 00:21:29.060 align:middle line:84%
And if everything was taken
from Job, he would curse God.

00:21:29.060 --> 00:21:31.580 align:middle line:84%
The motif is the
same as the weighing

00:21:31.580 --> 00:21:34.070 align:middle line:84%
of the heart, where the
individual's heart is

00:21:34.070 --> 00:21:36.170 align:middle line:90%
weighed on the scales of truth.

00:21:36.170 --> 00:21:42.570 align:middle line:84%
God was testing the heart of
Job against evil and misfortune.

00:21:42.570 --> 00:21:46.830 align:middle line:84%
And if you go to etymology,
it's very interesting.

00:21:46.830 --> 00:21:49.950 align:middle line:84%
Job-- the container
of the heart that

00:21:49.950 --> 00:21:54.620 align:middle line:84%
is weighed on the scales
in Egypt is called ib.

00:21:54.620 --> 00:21:55.640 align:middle line:90%
It's the same word.

00:21:55.640 --> 00:21:59.600 align:middle line:90%
"Job" and "ib" is the same word.

00:21:59.600 --> 00:22:00.860 align:middle line:90%
So it's the ib.

00:22:00.860 --> 00:22:01.730 align:middle line:90%
It's the heart.

00:22:01.730 --> 00:22:07.010 align:middle line:84%
It's the Job, the heart of man,
which is weighed on the scales.

00:22:07.010 --> 00:22:09.060 align:middle line:10%
So everything is connected.

00:22:09.060 --> 00:22:12.780 align:middle line:10%
It's just we've
lost the connection

00:22:12.780 --> 00:22:15.450 align:middle line:10%
to all this information.

00:22:15.450 --> 00:22:18.450 align:middle line:10%
So now we're going to get
into the creation myths

00:22:18.450 --> 00:22:21.262 align:middle line:10%
and the primordial waters.

00:22:21.262 --> 00:22:22.720 align:middle line:10%
And you have this
really cool image

00:22:22.720 --> 00:22:27.550 align:middle line:10%
here of the god Nun in the
dark waters before creation,

00:22:27.550 --> 00:22:32.170 align:middle line:10%
holding the boat, the
barge, with the sun on it.

00:22:32.170 --> 00:22:36.650 align:middle line:84%
And the story is, just very
simply, everything is darkness.

00:22:36.650 --> 00:22:39.230 align:middle line:84%
Everything is
chaos, dark waters.

00:22:39.230 --> 00:22:40.030 align:middle line:90%
There's no light.

00:22:40.030 --> 00:22:41.620 align:middle line:90%
There's no creation.

00:22:41.620 --> 00:22:46.540 align:middle line:10%
And Ra awakens by
knowing his name.

00:22:46.540 --> 00:22:48.880 align:middle line:10%
So suddenly, he is
aware of his name.

00:22:48.880 --> 00:22:50.810 align:middle line:10%
He speaks his name, Ra.

00:22:50.810 --> 00:22:53.020 align:middle line:10%
And as he does
that, he rises out

00:22:53.020 --> 00:22:57.670 align:middle line:10%
of the dark waters as the
rising sun, and the light

00:22:57.670 --> 00:23:00.610 align:middle line:10%
of Ra touches down on Earth.

00:23:00.610 --> 00:23:03.070 align:middle line:10%
Or what they call the mound.

00:23:03.070 --> 00:23:04.960 align:middle line:10%
His light touches the mound.

00:23:04.960 --> 00:23:09.490 align:middle line:10%
And that mound is
called the Benben stone.

00:23:09.490 --> 00:23:13.930 align:middle line:10%
Now, the top of the pyramid
is called the Benben stone.

00:23:13.930 --> 00:23:16.780 align:middle line:84%
So Ra's light, the
first light of Ra

00:23:16.780 --> 00:23:20.900 align:middle line:84%
touches the Benben stone, which
was in the shape of a pyramid.

00:23:20.900 --> 00:23:26.210 align:middle line:84%
So pyramids are to honor
the first light of creation.

00:23:26.210 --> 00:23:31.070 align:middle line:84%
All pyramids are
solar symbolism.

00:23:31.070 --> 00:23:33.800 align:middle line:10%
That's why you have
the pyramid over Jesus,

00:23:33.800 --> 00:23:37.820 align:middle line:10%
because Jesus is, in that
picture, a solar symbol.

00:23:37.820 --> 00:23:39.580 align:middle line:10%
This is the secret.

00:23:39.580 --> 00:23:45.300 align:middle line:84%
And you see this weird
glyph above the boat.

00:23:45.300 --> 00:23:48.630 align:middle line:84%
It's like the head
touching the feet.

00:23:48.630 --> 00:23:50.660 align:middle line:84%
This is thousands of
years old, head touching

00:23:50.660 --> 00:23:51.565 align:middle line:90%
the feet, this thing.

00:23:51.565 --> 00:23:54.470 align:middle line:90%


00:23:54.470 --> 00:23:57.530 align:middle line:10%
This is an image that's been
carried forward through time.

00:23:57.530 --> 00:24:00.440 align:middle line:84%
And it's called
The Man in the Sky.

00:24:00.440 --> 00:24:04.370 align:middle line:84%
And the man in the
sky is the year.

00:24:04.370 --> 00:24:05.420 align:middle line:10%
That's what it is.

00:24:05.420 --> 00:24:06.900 align:middle line:90%
It's like the throne of God.

00:24:06.900 --> 00:24:08.330 align:middle line:90%
It's the year.

00:24:08.330 --> 00:24:11.210 align:middle line:10%
The man in the sky
goes through in a cycle

00:24:11.210 --> 00:24:14.240 align:middle line:10%
all the constellations
of the zodiac.

00:24:14.240 --> 00:24:18.920 align:middle line:84%
So we have the same symbolism
thousands of years ago in Egypt

00:24:18.920 --> 00:24:21.460 align:middle line:90%
to today, same thing.

00:24:21.460 --> 00:24:24.220 align:middle line:90%


00:24:24.220 --> 00:24:26.770 align:middle line:10%
And here is the
mounds of creation.

00:24:26.770 --> 00:24:30.430 align:middle line:10%
This is very important
symbolism, these two mounds

00:24:30.430 --> 00:24:32.620 align:middle line:10%
with the sun in between it.

00:24:32.620 --> 00:24:37.800 align:middle line:10%
And you have the two
goddesses watering creation,

00:24:37.800 --> 00:24:39.733 align:middle line:10%
with the primordial waters.

00:24:39.733 --> 00:24:43.580 align:middle line:90%


00:24:43.580 --> 00:24:48.630 align:middle line:10%
Here you have the Aker Lyons
motif, which is the two lions.

00:24:48.630 --> 00:24:50.990 align:middle line:10%
And we know in
symbolisms, the lions

00:24:50.990 --> 00:24:54.950 align:middle line:10%
are the sun looking in the
two directions of the winter

00:24:54.950 --> 00:24:56.770 align:middle line:10%
solstice and summer solstice.

00:24:56.770 --> 00:24:59.150 align:middle line:84%
We have the equinox
sun between them.

00:24:59.150 --> 00:25:01.440 align:middle line:84%
And you can see the
ankh is in between.

00:25:01.440 --> 00:25:04.380 align:middle line:10%
This is the perfect balance
of life, the equinox.

00:25:04.380 --> 00:25:06.380 align:middle line:10%
And if you look closely
where the sun is,

00:25:06.380 --> 00:25:13.410 align:middle line:10%
you see the two mounds of
Creation, the two hills.

00:25:13.410 --> 00:25:18.060 align:middle line:84%
You have Isis and
Nephthys in this image,

00:25:18.060 --> 00:25:21.200 align:middle line:84%
honoring the Djed pillar and
the ankh with the sun above it.

00:25:21.200 --> 00:25:22.436 align:middle line:90%
It's the same symbolism.

00:25:22.436 --> 00:25:26.940 align:middle line:90%


00:25:26.940 --> 00:25:31.050 align:middle line:84%
And if you look closely,
look at their feet.

00:25:31.050 --> 00:25:34.900 align:middle line:84%
Each one of their feet in
the back is touching what?

00:25:34.900 --> 00:25:36.465 align:middle line:90%
The two mounds of creation.

00:25:36.465 --> 00:25:39.050 align:middle line:90%


00:25:39.050 --> 00:25:40.940 align:middle line:10%
So this is solar symbolism.

00:25:40.940 --> 00:25:42.470 align:middle line:10%
They're showing you the seasons.

00:25:42.470 --> 00:25:43.275 align:middle line:90%
This is a calendar.

00:25:43.275 --> 00:25:46.200 align:middle line:90%


00:25:46.200 --> 00:25:49.950 align:middle line:84%
And if you put it from
their eye to their feet,

00:25:49.950 --> 00:25:52.350 align:middle line:90%
it's a 23.5 degree angle.

00:25:52.350 --> 00:25:54.200 align:middle line:84%
They're talking about
the tilt of the Earth.

00:25:54.200 --> 00:25:57.360 align:middle line:90%


00:25:57.360 --> 00:26:03.650 align:middle line:10%
Now, the mounds of creation
are very interesting symbolism.

00:26:03.650 --> 00:26:06.460 align:middle line:10%
You have the mound in the west.

00:26:06.460 --> 00:26:08.470 align:middle line:10%
Now, what happens in the west?

00:26:08.470 --> 00:26:10.920 align:middle line:10%
The sun sets.

00:26:10.920 --> 00:26:13.390 align:middle line:10%
So it's the symbolism of dying.

00:26:13.390 --> 00:26:15.360 align:middle line:10%
The sun dies in the west.

00:26:15.360 --> 00:26:19.320 align:middle line:10%
In Egypt, when you die, you
travel to the western horizon.

00:26:19.320 --> 00:26:24.790 align:middle line:10%
You go to the western hill,
the Western mound of creation,

00:26:24.790 --> 00:26:25.770 align:middle line:10%
when you die.

00:26:25.770 --> 00:26:27.820 align:middle line:10%
And you're greeted by Hathor.

00:26:27.820 --> 00:26:29.760 align:middle line:10%
And in this picture,
you have Hathor

00:26:29.760 --> 00:26:36.280 align:middle line:10%
as the bull emerging
from the western mound

00:26:36.280 --> 00:26:38.580 align:middle line:10%
to greet you as you die.

00:26:38.580 --> 00:26:44.130 align:middle line:10%
Now, in Etruscan
gods, you have Vatika,

00:26:44.130 --> 00:26:47.970 align:middle line:10%
who is also the goddess
of the mound of the west.

00:26:47.970 --> 00:26:50.550 align:middle line:10%
And she has the
Necropolis, where

00:26:50.550 --> 00:26:55.650 align:middle line:10%
the dead go into the hill
on the western Horizon.

00:26:55.650 --> 00:26:59.980 align:middle line:10%
And we all know
the Vatican, right?

00:26:59.980 --> 00:27:05.980 align:middle line:10%
Vatican is named after
Vatika, the Etruscan goddess.

00:27:05.980 --> 00:27:13.010 align:middle line:10%
And it is built on the ancient
hill that the Romans honored,

00:27:13.010 --> 00:27:15.820 align:middle line:10%
Vatika.

00:27:15.820 --> 00:27:18.870 align:middle line:10%
So this is ancient, ancient
stuff, the western mound.

00:27:18.870 --> 00:27:22.260 align:middle line:10%
So the sun is born out
of the mound of creation

00:27:22.260 --> 00:27:27.700 align:middle line:10%
of the east, rises, and then it
dies in the mound of the west.

00:27:27.700 --> 00:27:31.540 align:middle line:10%
So this is the cycle of birth,
death, and resurrection.

00:27:31.540 --> 00:27:35.510 align:middle line:10%
It's based on these
mounds of creation.

00:27:35.510 --> 00:27:38.120 align:middle line:10%
Now, here's a Babylonian seal.

00:27:38.120 --> 00:27:39.530 align:middle line:10%
What do you see?

00:27:39.530 --> 00:27:42.740 align:middle line:10%
The two mounds and the god--

00:27:42.740 --> 00:27:43.940 align:middle line:10%
I think this is Marduk--

00:27:43.940 --> 00:27:47.060 align:middle line:10%
rising between the two mounds.

00:27:47.060 --> 00:27:48.890 align:middle line:10%
And it's solar symbolism.

00:27:48.890 --> 00:27:52.200 align:middle line:10%
Again, so it's the sun rising
between the two mounds.

00:27:52.200 --> 00:27:54.290 align:middle line:10%
And you have the
Babylonian trees

00:27:54.290 --> 00:27:56.990 align:middle line:10%
of life growing on
the mounds that he's

00:27:56.990 --> 00:27:59.220 align:middle line:10%
pouring the water down.

00:27:59.220 --> 00:28:01.690 align:middle line:90%
This is in Cusco, Peru.

00:28:01.690 --> 00:28:04.260 align:middle line:84%
You have these two
mounds of this site.

00:28:04.260 --> 00:28:05.730 align:middle line:90%
That's not really well known.

00:28:05.730 --> 00:28:07.770 align:middle line:84%
And they don't know
anything about this,

00:28:07.770 --> 00:28:11.850 align:middle line:84%
but they say that this is
an astrological observatory

00:28:11.850 --> 00:28:15.930 align:middle line:84%
from the ancient people
that lived there.

00:28:15.930 --> 00:28:20.690 align:middle line:84%
Now, this is important because
Peru has incredible sites

00:28:20.690 --> 00:28:22.560 align:middle line:90%
for solar observation.

00:28:22.560 --> 00:28:24.940 align:middle line:84%
In fact, they have one
of the best in the world,

00:28:24.940 --> 00:28:27.390 align:middle line:90%
going back to 2,300 years.

00:28:27.390 --> 00:28:30.390 align:middle line:90%
And this is how it works.

00:28:30.390 --> 00:28:36.090 align:middle line:84%
So they have these mounds, just
like the mounds of creation,

00:28:36.090 --> 00:28:38.020 align:middle line:90%
set up on a ridge.

00:28:38.020 --> 00:28:39.840 align:middle line:90%
And it measures the time.

00:28:39.840 --> 00:28:44.140 align:middle line:84%
So you can see the sun
setting behind the mounds.

00:28:44.140 --> 00:28:50.260 align:middle line:84%
And they can tell the dates from
the solstice to the equinoxes.

00:28:50.260 --> 00:28:51.820 align:middle line:10%
Now, I want you to see this.

00:28:51.820 --> 00:28:55.450 align:middle line:10%
This is a 3,000-year-old
petroglyph of a man running away

00:28:55.450 --> 00:28:56.258 align:middle line:10%
from a snake.

00:28:56.258 --> 00:28:57.550 align:middle line:10%
That's what they think this is.

00:28:57.550 --> 00:29:00.140 align:middle line:10%
And this is from Sweden.

00:29:00.140 --> 00:29:02.107 align:middle line:10%
But just look closely.

00:29:02.107 --> 00:29:04.190 align:middle line:10%
Does that man look like
he's running from a snake,

00:29:04.190 --> 00:29:05.710 align:middle line:10%
or he looks happy to see it?

00:29:05.710 --> 00:29:09.520 align:middle line:90%


00:29:09.520 --> 00:29:10.900 align:middle line:10%
Right?

00:29:10.900 --> 00:29:15.320 align:middle line:10%
And then what's above
one of these mounds?

00:29:15.320 --> 00:29:16.245 align:middle line:10%
The sun.

00:29:16.245 --> 00:29:19.010 align:middle line:10%


00:29:19.010 --> 00:29:21.020 align:middle line:10%
So I'm just going to
go back for a second.

00:29:21.020 --> 00:29:22.860 align:middle line:10%
Look at this.

00:29:22.860 --> 00:29:29.010 align:middle line:84%
It's the same symbolism
separated by the entire planet.

00:29:29.010 --> 00:29:31.545 align:middle line:10%
It's the opposite
side of the planet,

00:29:31.545 --> 00:29:35.930 align:middle line:10%
but it's showing you the same
technology 3,000 years ago,

00:29:35.930 --> 00:29:39.260 align:middle line:10%
same understanding,
same knowledge.

00:29:39.260 --> 00:29:41.730 align:middle line:84%
And these sites are
all over America.

00:29:41.730 --> 00:29:44.280 align:middle line:84%
This is Poverty
Point in Mississippi.

00:29:44.280 --> 00:29:45.800 align:middle line:90%
They set up mounds.

00:29:45.800 --> 00:29:48.760 align:middle line:84%
You ever hear of
the mound builders?

00:29:48.760 --> 00:29:51.710 align:middle line:84%
The mounds, the mounds
of the east and the west.

00:29:51.710 --> 00:29:54.730 align:middle line:10%
They measured where the
sun will go into the mounds

00:29:54.730 --> 00:29:59.980 align:middle line:10%
and come out of the mounds on
the equinoxes and solstices--

00:29:59.980 --> 00:30:06.390 align:middle line:10%
same technology, same
understanding in America.

00:30:06.390 --> 00:30:11.070 align:middle line:10%
This is a Akkadian
cylinder from 2,300 BC,

00:30:11.070 --> 00:30:15.150 align:middle line:10%
depicting the deities
Ishtar, Shamash, and Enki.

00:30:15.150 --> 00:30:17.360 align:middle line:10%
Look carefully.

00:30:17.360 --> 00:30:19.740 align:middle line:10%
It's the two mounds.

00:30:19.740 --> 00:30:22.470 align:middle line:10%
And they're rising
out of the two mounds

00:30:22.470 --> 00:30:24.370 align:middle line:10%
or stepping on the mounds.

00:30:24.370 --> 00:30:28.080 align:middle line:10%
This is the symbolism to
show you a date and time.

00:30:28.080 --> 00:30:29.320 align:middle line:10%
This is showing you a date.

00:30:29.320 --> 00:30:33.810 align:middle line:10%
Each deity represents a sun in
a different time of the year.

00:30:33.810 --> 00:30:36.860 align:middle line:90%

00:30:36.860 --> 00:30:41.000 align:middle line:90%
