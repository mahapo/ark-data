00:01:20.290 --> 00:01:21.970 align:middle line:90%

than the train.

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:02.120 align:middle line:84%

provide a double who

like me, and moves like me.

and it's a fascinating series--

00:02:30.550 --> 00:02:32.680 align:middle line:90%
I want to explain a few things.

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:34.730 align:middle line:84%
Why does his voice
sound like that?

00:02:34.730 --> 00:02:36.088 align:middle line:90%
Why does he have a hood on?

00:02:36.088 --> 00:02:37.630 align:middle line:84%
Well, number one,
that's the only way

00:02:37.630 --> 00:02:39.790 align:middle line:84%
I can get him to sit
down for an interview.

00:02:39.790 --> 00:02:42.280 align:middle line:90%
That's the first thing.

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:46.210 align:middle line:84%
Number two, I want you guys
to ask yourself a question.

00:02:46.210 --> 00:02:48.877 align:middle line:90%
What he has to gain from this?

00:02:48.877 --> 00:02:50.960 align:middle line:84%
It's one thing if he was
sitting there and saying,

00:02:50.960 --> 00:02:51.850 align:middle line:90%
look what I could do.

00:02:51.850 --> 00:02:53.230 align:middle line:90%
And this is who I am.

00:02:53.230 --> 00:02:54.250 align:middle line:90%
Know me.

00:02:54.250 --> 00:02:56.240 align:middle line:10%
That's the ego talking.

00:02:56.240 --> 00:02:57.820 align:middle line:84%
But when we follow
the money and when

00:02:57.820 --> 00:03:00.532 align:middle line:84%
we follow certain
intentions, I didn't

00:03:00.532 --> 00:03:02.740 align:middle line:84%
like that it was going on
like this in the beginning.

00:03:02.740 --> 00:03:03.900 align:middle line:90%
It really upset me.

00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:05.830 align:middle line:84%
I said, why aren't
you just coming out.

00:03:05.830 --> 00:03:07.840 align:middle line:84%
And about six to
eight months later

00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:09.460 align:middle line:84%
I understood the
genius of why it

00:03:09.460 --> 00:03:11.590 align:middle line:84%
was being done like that
because I didn't agree.

00:03:11.590 --> 00:03:13.570 align:middle line:84%
And the genius
behind why it's being

00:03:13.570 --> 00:03:16.360 align:middle line:84%
done like that is because think
about it like this, right now,

00:03:16.360 --> 00:03:18.400 align:middle line:84%
everybody around the
world, they always

00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:20.470 align:middle line:84%
look who can I
outsource my power to?

00:03:23.710 --> 00:03:26.930 align:middle line:84%
You can't attach an
identity to that man.

00:03:26.930 --> 00:03:28.220 align:middle line:90%
You don't know who he is.

00:03:28.220 --> 00:03:31.160 align:middle line:84%
You don't know
where he comes from.

00:03:31.160 --> 00:03:32.798 align:middle line:84%
I mean, now, you
know certain things

00:03:32.798 --> 00:03:35.090 align:middle line:84%
because I told you certain
things about his background.

00:03:35.090 --> 00:03:38.570 align:middle line:84%
But let's say he was Black, and
let's say that a viewer didn't

00:03:38.570 --> 00:03:40.160 align:middle line:90%
like a Black person.

00:03:40.160 --> 00:03:42.140 align:middle line:84%
There's automatically
a distance.

00:03:42.140 --> 00:03:44.360 align:middle line:84%
Let's say he was
Jewish, which he is.

00:03:44.360 --> 00:03:47.240 align:middle line:84%
And people don't like somebody
doesn't like a Jewish person.

00:03:47.240 --> 00:03:49.260 align:middle line:84%
There's automatically
a distance.

00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:51.530 align:middle line:84%
So I think the genius of
what was going on there

00:03:51.530 --> 00:03:53.030 align:middle line:84%
and why it was done
like this, which

00:03:53.030 --> 00:03:54.572 align:middle line:84%
I didn't agree with
in the beginning,

00:03:54.572 --> 00:03:57.950 align:middle line:84%
but I understood later on,
is the inability to attach

00:03:57.950 --> 00:03:59.900 align:middle line:90%
an identity to this person.

00:03:59.900 --> 00:04:03.110 align:middle line:84%
And not only is it good for him
because it keeps him in line.

00:04:03.110 --> 00:04:04.410 align:middle line:90%
There is no ego involved.

00:04:04.410 --> 00:04:05.810 align:middle line:90%
There is no interest involved.

00:04:05.810 --> 00:04:07.640 align:middle line:84%
It only annoys him
every time I say,

00:04:07.640 --> 00:04:10.460 align:middle line:84%
please, free your schedule for
me and come sit in this chair.

00:04:10.460 --> 00:04:14.420 align:middle line:84%
But it also helps the viewer
because the viewer cannot attach

00:04:14.420 --> 00:04:19.130 align:middle line:84%
an identity, a religion, this
or that, x, y, or z to that,

00:04:19.130 --> 00:04:21.290 align:middle line:84%
which makes it as
neutral as possible,

00:04:21.290 --> 00:04:24.170 align:middle line:84%
given that the information being
shared through these interviews

00:04:24.170 --> 00:04:27.418 align:middle line:84%
are very, very out of this world
literally and figuratively.

The next video I want to show
you in just a few seconds

has to do with

00:04:32.350 --> 00:04:35.980 align:middle line:84%
Natural disasters are not what
they have been a long time ago.

00:04:35.980 --> 00:04:39.110 align:middle line:84%
They're not really natural
for the most part anymore.

00:04:39.110 --> 00:04:40.687 align:middle line:84%
There are certain
individuals that

00:04:40.687 --> 00:04:42.520 align:middle line:84%
have technology around
the world, where they

00:04:42.520 --> 00:04:44.830 align:middle line:90%
can induce certain disasters.

00:04:44.830 --> 00:04:46.690 align:middle line:84%
So they call them
natural disasters.

00:04:46.690 --> 00:04:49.920 align:middle line:84%
But pay attention to what's been
going on over the past couple

00:04:49.920 --> 00:04:50.720 align:middle line:90%
of years.

00:04:50.720 --> 00:04:52.930 align:middle line:84%
There are fires in ways
that there shouldn't be.

00:04:52.930 --> 00:04:54.790 align:middle line:84%
There are natural
disasters in ways

00:04:54.790 --> 00:04:56.480 align:middle line:90%
that we've never seen before.

00:04:56.480 --> 00:04:58.840 align:middle line:84%
They blame it on
global warming and then

00:04:58.840 --> 00:05:00.640 align:middle line:84%
push certain
initiatives there, which

00:05:00.640 --> 00:05:02.560 align:middle line:84%
make somebody else a
whole lot of money,

00:05:02.560 --> 00:05:04.850 align:middle line:84%
but that's not what's
really going on.

00:05:04.850 --> 00:05:07.640 align:middle line:84%
It's problem,
reaction, solution.

00:05:07.640 --> 00:05:09.790 align:middle line:84%
And one of the
mediums used in order

00:05:09.790 --> 00:05:12.865 align:middle line:84%
to take control over the
world is natural disasters.

00:05:12.865 --> 00:05:15.130 align:middle line:84%
You can destroy
economies with them.

00:05:15.130 --> 00:05:17.012 align:middle line:84%
You can destroy
cities with them,

00:05:17.012 --> 00:05:18.220 align:middle line:90%
which will destroy economies.

00:05:18.220 --> 00:05:21.430 align:middle line:84%
You can destabilize
entire regions with them.

00:05:21.430 --> 00:05:25.600 align:middle line:84%
TLS will come in certain
cases, and sometimes they fail.

00:05:25.600 --> 00:05:28.188 align:middle line:84%
And Hawaii is one of the
situations where they

00:05:28.188 --> 00:05:29.480 align:middle line:90%
failed because they were there.

00:05:29.480 --> 00:05:31.550 align:middle line:84%
That should not have
happened, but it happened.

00:05:31.550 --> 00:05:34.430 align:middle line:84%
So I can sit here and tell
you what didn't happen,

00:05:34.430 --> 00:05:35.690 align:middle line:90%
but that's hard right?

00:05:35.690 --> 00:05:37.700 align:middle line:84%
Because if I tell you,
well, it didn't happen,

00:05:37.700 --> 00:05:39.158 align:middle line:84%
how do you really
know it happened?

00:05:39.158 --> 00:05:41.270 align:middle line:84%
So I can't prove something
like that to you.

00:05:41.270 --> 00:05:44.810 align:middle line:84%
What I can tell you is that when
it comes to natural disasters

00:05:44.810 --> 00:05:47.240 align:middle line:84%
and I can tell you how they
do certain things like that,

00:05:47.240 --> 00:05:48.890 align:middle line:84%
we'll do that in
the Q&A portion,

00:05:48.890 --> 00:05:51.035 align:middle line:84%
of how do you actually
stop or change

00:05:51.035 --> 00:05:53.660 align:middle line:84%
the weather for the better when
somebody is trying to change it

00:05:53.660 --> 00:05:54.680 align:middle line:90%
for the worst.

00:05:54.680 --> 00:05:57.950 align:middle line:84%
And it's tied back to what
they call the Book of Creation.

00:05:57.950 --> 00:06:00.320 align:middle line:84%
It's known to be a book
written by Abraham.

00:06:00.320 --> 00:06:01.798 align:middle line:84%
Nobody actually
knows who wrote it.

00:06:01.798 --> 00:06:03.840 align:middle line:84%
In Hebrew, because that's
what it was written in,

00:06:03.840 --> 00:06:05.600 align:middle line:90%
it's called [SPEAKING HEBREW].

00:06:05.600 --> 00:06:09.035 align:middle line:84%
And they use certain the
language and the letters

00:06:09.035 --> 00:06:11.660 align:middle line:84%
and the frequency behind that,
it's called the Book of Creation

00:06:11.660 --> 00:06:16.430 align:middle line:84%
for a reason because creation is
basically done through speech.

00:06:16.430 --> 00:06:19.730 align:middle line:84%
And the medium on each side
of speech of that spectrum

00:06:19.730 --> 00:06:21.530 align:middle line:90%
is thought and matter.

00:06:21.530 --> 00:06:23.240 align:middle line:90%
So it starts with thought.

00:06:23.240 --> 00:06:24.970 align:middle line:84%
Speech is what
creates and brings it

00:06:24.970 --> 00:06:25.970 align:middle line:90%
into something physical.

00:06:25.970 --> 00:06:28.980 align:middle line:84%
It's basically like water
moving from a gas to a liquid

00:06:28.980 --> 00:06:29.780 align:middle line:90%
to a solid.

00:06:29.780 --> 00:06:32.790 align:middle line:84%
It's the same thing, only
in a different frequency.

00:06:32.790 --> 00:06:35.300 align:middle line:84%
And when you understand how to
manipulate those frequencies,

00:06:35.300 --> 00:06:37.250 align:middle line:90%
you can use that power for good.

00:06:37.250 --> 00:06:39.740 align:middle line:84%
But secrecy is also
very important in that

00:06:39.740 --> 00:06:42.750 align:middle line:84%
because if certain
people gain that power,

00:06:42.750 --> 00:06:45.210 align:middle line:90%
they can do a lot of harm.

00:06:45.210 --> 00:06:46.010 align:middle line:90%

paying attention lately.

00:06:48.260 --> 00:06:49.760 align:middle line:84%
There's a lot of
natural disasters.

00:06:49.760 --> 00:06:52.640 align:middle line:10%
Everything that you see, for
example, the floods in Australia

00:06:52.640 --> 00:06:55.950 align:middle line:10%
that happened recently.

00:06:55.950 --> 00:06:58.870 align:middle line:10%
Everything you see
there is man-made.

00:06:58.870 --> 00:07:02.380 align:middle line:10%
For them to create a
tsunami, it's very simple.

00:07:02.380 --> 00:07:06.280 align:middle line:10%
If you remember, we
spoke about EMP, EMLP.

00:07:06.280 --> 00:07:08.080 align:middle line:10%
That's the technology
that they have.

00:07:08.080 --> 00:07:10.570 align:middle line:10%
You could use nuclear
bombs to create tsunamis.

00:07:10.570 --> 00:07:12.825 align:middle line:10%
Look what happened in
Tonga a few months ago.

00:07:12.825 --> 00:07:14.200 align:middle line:10%
We were supposed
to get a tsunami

00:07:14.200 --> 00:07:16.270 align:middle line:10%
on the east coast of
the United States,

00:07:16.270 --> 00:07:18.475 align:middle line:10%

I'm talking about a tsunami
that the world never

00:07:22.470 --> 00:07:23.760 align:middle line:10%
heard or seen before.

00:07:25.970 --> 00:07:27.730 align:middle line:10%

>>SHURKA: How do you stop
an induced natural disaster?

00:07:31.150 --> 00:07:33.730 align:middle line:10%
Better yet, how
did you stop what

00:07:33.730 --> 00:07:35.410 align:middle line:10%
was supposed to hit
New York and Boston?

00:07:35.410 --> 00:07:40.442 align:middle line:90%


00:07:40.442 --> 00:07:42.150 align:middle line:84%
What you're seeing
over there is the fact

00:07:42.150 --> 00:07:44.850 align:middle line:84%
that natural disasters
are used to create chaos

00:07:44.850 --> 00:07:45.690 align:middle line:90%
around the world.

00:07:45.690 --> 00:07:49.020 align:middle line:84%
And sometimes TLS is able to
succeed to stop those things.

00:07:49.020 --> 00:07:52.327 align:middle line:84%
Again, in many cases,
using the Book of Creation

00:07:52.327 --> 00:07:54.660 align:middle line:84%
with the knowledge and the
awareness of the true meaning

00:07:54.660 --> 00:07:58.110 align:middle line:84%
of the Book of Creation to
create something or stop

00:07:58.110 --> 00:08:00.430 align:middle line:84%
something from happening
in the first place.

00:08:00.430 --> 00:08:03.750 align:middle line:84%
Many of you probably know
about HAARP, H-A-A-R-P.

00:08:03.750 --> 00:08:05.670 align:middle line:84%
What I'm talking
about is not a theory.

00:08:05.670 --> 00:08:07.560 align:middle line:84%
We know that there's
technology out

00:08:07.560 --> 00:08:10.140 align:middle line:84%
there that's used,
using the manipulation

00:08:10.140 --> 00:08:13.680 align:middle line:84%
of frequencies to shift things
in the stratosphere, to make it

00:08:13.680 --> 00:08:17.790 align:middle line:84%
rain, to make it snow, to make
it hail, to create a hurricane.

00:08:17.790 --> 00:08:20.100 align:middle line:84%
That's the part of
this conversation

00:08:20.100 --> 00:08:22.058 align:middle line:84%
that I want to bring to
ground what I'm saying.

00:08:22.058 --> 00:08:24.267 align:middle line:84%
Because if we just say
they're natural disasters that

00:08:24.267 --> 00:08:26.250 align:middle line:84%
are being created by
people without giving you

00:08:26.250 --> 00:08:27.900 align:middle line:84%
where you can actually
read about that,

00:08:27.900 --> 00:08:29.380 align:middle line:90%
it makes it hard to believe.

00:08:29.380 --> 00:08:32.909 align:middle line:84%
When you start reading about
something like HAARP, H-A-A-R-P.

00:08:32.909 --> 00:08:34.620 align:middle line:84%
Right now, it's
based out of Alaska.

00:08:34.620 --> 00:08:36.990 align:middle line:90%
It started in Montauk, New York.

00:08:36.990 --> 00:08:38.940 align:middle line:90%
It's been used since the '50s.

00:08:38.940 --> 00:08:40.240 align:middle line:90%
It's nothing new.

00:08:40.240 --> 00:08:41.955 align:middle line:90%
Weather is being weaponized.

00:08:41.955 --> 00:08:43.330 align:middle line:84%
If you look into
something called

00:08:43.330 --> 00:08:46.480 align:middle line:84%
Operation Popeye in
the Vietnamese war,

00:08:46.480 --> 00:08:47.950 align:middle line:90%
they weaponized weather.

00:08:47.950 --> 00:08:50.380 align:middle line:84%
When I say they, I'm talking
about us, the United States.

00:08:50.380 --> 00:08:53.860 align:middle line:84%
The United States weaponized
weather in Vietnam

00:08:53.860 --> 00:08:55.960 align:middle line:84%
in order to make
it rain, to make

00:08:55.960 --> 00:09:00.280 align:middle line:84%
it harder for soldiers
to receive their supplies

00:09:00.280 --> 00:09:02.410 align:middle line:84%
and make it harder to walk
and do all those things.

00:09:02.410 --> 00:09:03.383 align:middle line:90%
It's on record.

00:09:03.383 --> 00:09:05.050 align:middle line:84%
It's something that's
been spoken about.

00:09:05.050 --> 00:09:09.730 align:middle line:84%
There have been over 188
patents on weather modification

00:09:09.730 --> 00:09:12.040 align:middle line:90%
technology ever since the 1860s.

00:09:12.040 --> 00:09:13.510 align:middle line:90%
This is public knowledge.

00:09:13.510 --> 00:09:17.450 align:middle line:84%
The Chinese Olympics used
weather modification,

00:09:17.450 --> 00:09:18.320 align:middle line:90%
even spoke about it.

00:09:18.320 --> 00:09:19.550 align:middle line:90%
They boast about it.

00:09:19.550 --> 00:09:21.970 align:middle line:84%
They say we're going
to have perfect weather

00:09:21.970 --> 00:09:23.620 align:middle line:90%
for the Olympics.

00:09:23.620 --> 00:09:24.650 align:middle line:90%
They spoke about it.

00:09:24.650 --> 00:09:25.450 align:middle line:90%
They share it.

00:09:25.450 --> 00:09:26.290 align:middle line:90%
It's not a secret.

00:09:26.290 --> 00:09:29.200 align:middle line:84%
The CIA, the head of the
CIA, John Brennan, I think

00:09:29.200 --> 00:09:31.660 align:middle line:84%
was his name, the former
head, if I'm not mistaken.

00:09:31.660 --> 00:09:32.510 align:middle line:90%
He spoke about it.

00:09:32.510 --> 00:09:35.230 align:middle line:84%
They call it stratospheric
aerosol injections.

00:09:35.230 --> 00:09:37.120 align:middle line:84%
I know I'm dropping
a lot of information.

00:09:37.120 --> 00:09:38.465 align:middle line:90%
You guys take what you want.

00:09:38.465 --> 00:09:39.340 align:middle line:90%
Leave what you don't.

00:09:39.340 --> 00:09:42.130 align:middle line:84%
But all of this is public
knowledge that you can look at.

00:09:42.130 --> 00:09:43.990 align:middle line:84%
Stratospheric
aerosol injection is

00:09:43.990 --> 00:09:47.620 align:middle line:84%
using aerosol injected into
the stratosphere in order

00:09:47.620 --> 00:09:51.340 align:middle line:84%
to create a blanket, a chemical
cloud around the planet.

00:09:51.340 --> 00:09:53.920 align:middle line:10%
I know Bill Gates is
speaking about doing publicly

00:09:53.920 --> 00:09:57.820 align:middle line:10%
to combat global
warming, only to find out

00:09:57.820 --> 00:10:02.120 align:middle line:10%
that it actually increases
overnight high temperatures.

00:10:02.120 --> 00:10:04.120 align:middle line:84%
So does it really
combat global warming,

00:10:04.120 --> 00:10:06.380 align:middle line:84%
or is there something
else going on here?

00:10:06.380 --> 00:10:08.650 align:middle line:84%
The next thing that they've
done and that they've

00:10:08.650 --> 00:10:10.240 align:middle line:84%
played a big role
in, and this is

00:10:10.240 --> 00:10:12.100 align:middle line:84%
where extraterrestrial
life comes in,

00:10:12.100 --> 00:10:14.380 align:middle line:90%
has to do with children.

00:10:14.380 --> 00:10:17.980 align:middle line:84%
There has been a lot of
information coming out recently

00:10:17.980 --> 00:10:21.070 align:middle line:84%
over the past few years
regarding underground sex

00:10:21.070 --> 00:10:21.870 align:middle line:90%
trafficking rings.

00:10:21.870 --> 00:10:24.370 align:middle line:84%
And I know it's hard to speak
about and hear about and think

00:10:24.370 --> 00:10:25.763 align:middle line:90%
about, but it's real.

00:10:25.763 --> 00:10:28.180 align:middle line:84%
And we do have to acknowledge
the things that are going on

00:10:28.180 --> 00:10:31.510 align:middle line:84%
in this world if we want
to get to a point of fixing

00:10:31.510 --> 00:10:32.330 align:middle line:90%
that problem.

00:10:32.330 --> 00:10:35.410 align:middle line:84%
So what I'm sharing today
is not meant to induce fear.

00:10:35.410 --> 00:10:38.560 align:middle line:84%
It's meant to raise awareness,
shed light on the darkness,

00:10:38.560 --> 00:10:41.760 align:middle line:84%
so we can dissolve that
darkness once and for all.

00:11:55.160 --> 00:11:57.890 align:middle line:84%
"Sound of Freedom," I happen to
be an executive producer on that

movie.

00:11:58.690 --> 00:12:00.980 align:middle line:84%
And I decided to do that
because of this information,

00:12:00.980 --> 00:12:02.540 align:middle line:90%
because of what you just saw.

00:12:02.540 --> 00:12:05.210 align:middle line:84%
Because it's public knowledge
that 2 million children

00:12:05.210 --> 00:12:08.280 align:middle line:84%
around the world are trafficked,
and that's just what's reported.

00:12:08.280 --> 00:12:09.920 align:middle line:84%
So if that's just
what's reported,

00:12:09.920 --> 00:12:11.570 align:middle line:84%
you can double or
triple that number.

00:12:11.570 --> 00:12:14.240 align:middle line:84%
That should not be happening
in the world that we're in,

but it does.

00:12:15.330 --> 00:12:16.610 align:middle line:84%
And if we want to
overcome that, we're

00:12:16.610 --> 00:12:18.693 align:middle line:84%
going to have to look at
that straight in the face

00:12:18.693 --> 00:12:20.130 align:middle line:84%
and understand
this is happening.

00:12:20.130 --> 00:12:20.930 align:middle line:90%
This is dark.

00:12:20.930 --> 00:12:22.790 align:middle line:84%
This is evil, and
we have the power

00:12:22.790 --> 00:12:25.910 align:middle line:84%
to overcome that, number 1,
by being aware, and number 2,

00:12:25.910 --> 00:12:27.240 align:middle line:90%
by taking action.

00:12:27.240 --> 00:12:29.540 align:middle line:84%
So "Sound of Freedom,"
just to be very clear,

00:12:29.540 --> 00:12:32.930 align:middle line:84%
touched the tip of the tip
of the tip of the iceberg

00:12:32.930 --> 00:12:34.580 align:middle line:90%
of what's actually going on.

00:12:34.580 --> 00:12:37.430 align:middle line:84%
That was the littlest
drop of what's actually

00:12:37.430 --> 00:12:38.520 align:middle line:90%
going on around the world.

00:12:38.520 --> 00:12:40.460 align:middle line:84%
But it did create a
big wave of awareness

00:12:40.460 --> 00:12:42.830 align:middle line:84%
for people to start saying,
what's really going on here.

00:12:42.830 --> 00:12:45.650 align:middle line:84%
Imagine, they released a movie
about underground tunnels

00:12:45.650 --> 00:12:48.170 align:middle line:84%
exposing certain ex-presidents
and vice presidents

00:12:48.170 --> 00:12:49.160 align:middle line:90%
that are a part of it.

00:12:49.160 --> 00:12:51.230 align:middle line:90%
Kathy O'Brien does that.

00:12:51.230 --> 00:12:54.540 align:middle line:84%
Kathy O'Brien has a movie on
Unified TV called "Trance."

00:12:54.540 --> 00:12:56.040 align:middle line:84%
And I'm not going
to name names here

00:12:56.040 --> 00:12:57.373 align:middle line:90%
because I don't want to do that.

00:12:57.373 --> 00:13:00.090 align:middle line:84%
But she'll tell you stories
of ex-presidents and ex-vice

00:13:00.090 --> 00:13:03.360 align:middle line:84%
presidents who she was hunted
with as a kid because they do

00:13:03.360 --> 00:13:06.100 align:middle line:90%
that and who she was raped by.

00:13:06.100 --> 00:13:07.660 align:middle line:90%
That's crazy.

00:13:07.660 --> 00:13:10.540 align:middle line:84%
And she's still alive somehow I
think because if she wasn't, it

00:13:10.540 --> 00:13:11.440 align:middle line:90%
would be obvious.

00:13:11.440 --> 00:13:13.840 align:middle line:84%
But pay attention, they never
brought a defamation suit

00:13:13.840 --> 00:13:15.700 align:middle line:84%
against her because
if they did, there

00:13:15.700 --> 00:13:17.800 align:middle line:84%
would be information
that came out in court.

00:13:17.800 --> 00:13:19.000 align:middle line:90%
There's proof.

00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:20.380 align:middle line:90%
This is coming out.

00:13:20.380 --> 00:13:22.860 align:middle line:84%
She's a very big
proponent of all of this.

00:13:22.860 --> 00:13:25.660 align:middle line:84%
TLS actually had a meeting
with her a few times.

00:13:25.660 --> 00:13:28.030 align:middle line:84%
TLS loves the work
that she does.

00:13:28.030 --> 00:13:31.120 align:middle line:84%
So what is the connection
to extraterrestrial life

00:13:31.120 --> 00:13:34.280 align:middle line:84%
when it comes to children,
underground sex trafficking

00:13:34.280 --> 00:13:35.080 align:middle line:90%
rings.

00:13:35.080 --> 00:13:39.190 align:middle line:84%
Because there are large ones
that connect the entire planet.

00:13:39.190 --> 00:13:43.840 align:middle line:84%
Big hub of that, by the way,
is under the airport in Denver.

00:13:43.840 --> 00:13:45.460 align:middle line:90%
A lot of people know about that.

00:13:45.460 --> 00:13:47.480 align:middle line:84%
There's a lot of weird
things going on there.

00:13:47.480 --> 00:13:50.680 align:middle line:84%
Denver is a very big place
where they'll take them in from.

00:13:50.680 --> 00:13:55.020 align:middle line:84%
Disneyland is a very big place
where they take them in from.

00:13:55.020 --> 00:13:58.320 align:middle line:84%
Portugal is a very big hub for
what you call adrenochrome,

00:13:58.320 --> 00:14:00.033 align:middle line:90%
so is South Africa.

00:14:00.033 --> 00:14:01.950 align:middle line:84%
I forgot the third one
off the top of my head.

00:14:01.950 --> 00:14:05.215 align:middle line:84%
But there are three main
hubs around the world,

00:14:05.215 --> 00:14:06.840 align:middle line:84%
underground where
they do these things.

00:14:06.840 --> 00:14:09.900 align:middle line:84%
Now, let me ground it for you,
so it doesn't sound crazy.

00:14:09.900 --> 00:14:13.200 align:middle line:84%
Have you guys ever heard
of Dr. Josef Mengele?

00:14:13.200 --> 00:14:17.880 align:middle line:84%
For anybody who hasn't, Dr.
Josef Mengele publicly during

00:14:17.880 --> 00:14:20.550 align:middle line:84%
the Holocaust did everything
that I'm saying that they do

00:14:20.550 --> 00:14:23.610 align:middle line:84%
to children now
to, in that case,

00:14:23.610 --> 00:14:26.910 align:middle line:84%
Jewish kids and other children
as well throughout the Holocaust

00:14:26.910 --> 00:14:28.030 align:middle line:90%
in the 1940s.

00:14:28.030 --> 00:14:29.380 align:middle line:90%
It's public knowledge.

00:14:29.380 --> 00:14:31.920 align:middle line:84%
So if they did it
back then, is it

00:14:31.920 --> 00:14:35.130 align:middle line:84%
hard to understand that
they're still doing it today?

00:14:35.130 --> 00:14:38.250 align:middle line:84%
If Julius Caesar was
a pedophile, which

00:14:38.250 --> 00:14:41.250 align:middle line:84%
he was publicly, it was an
honor to give your child

00:14:41.250 --> 00:14:42.390 align:middle line:90%
to Julius Caesar.

00:14:42.390 --> 00:14:43.950 align:middle line:84%
That's how they
thought back then.

00:14:43.950 --> 00:14:47.467 align:middle line:84%
So if that was open knowledge
in a public thing back then,

00:14:47.467 --> 00:14:49.300 align:middle line:84%
do you really think it
doesn't happen today?

00:14:49.300 --> 00:14:51.930 align:middle line:84%
It's just not accepted today,
so they do it underground.

00:14:51.930 --> 00:14:53.370 align:middle line:90%
They do it in different ways.

00:14:53.370 --> 00:14:56.812 align:middle line:84%
TLS Interferes with those
things and stops those things

00:14:56.812 --> 00:14:58.020 align:middle line:90%
to the best of their ability.

00:14:58.020 --> 00:15:00.302 align:middle line:84%
But they removed hundreds
of thousands of children

00:15:00.302 --> 00:15:02.010 align:middle line:84%
from those-- children
from those tunnels.

00:15:02.010 --> 00:15:05.890 align:middle line:84%
Now, the next valid
question is, where are they?

00:15:05.890 --> 00:15:06.760 align:middle line:90%
Where are they?

00:15:06.760 --> 00:15:08.555 align:middle line:84%
Number one, where
are their parents?

00:15:08.555 --> 00:15:10.180 align:middle line:84%
So let's talk about
where their parents

00:15:10.180 --> 00:15:12.437 align:middle line:84%
are before I answer the
question of where are they

00:15:12.437 --> 00:15:14.020 align:middle line:84%
because the question
of where are they

00:15:14.020 --> 00:15:16.240 align:middle line:84%
connects to what's on
the screen right now.

00:15:16.240 --> 00:15:19.880 align:middle line:84%
Where are their parents doesn't
apply when you clone somebody?

00:15:19.880 --> 00:15:21.830 align:middle line:84%
Cloning started in
the '80s and '90s.

00:15:21.830 --> 00:15:25.230 align:middle line:84%
The Denver Airport under there
was a very big hub of that.

00:15:25.230 --> 00:15:27.270 align:middle line:84%
Now, it extends all
around the world.

00:15:27.270 --> 00:15:30.360 align:middle line:84%
We know that they cloned sheep
means they can clone humans.

00:15:30.360 --> 00:15:32.630 align:middle line:84%
They just don't do it publicly
because it's not moral.

00:15:32.630 --> 00:15:33.430 align:middle line:90%
It's not humane.

00:15:33.430 --> 00:15:35.990 align:middle line:84%
They do it they just
do it somewhere else.

00:15:35.990 --> 00:15:37.610 align:middle line:84%
They do a lot of
things somewhere else

00:15:37.610 --> 00:15:39.140 align:middle line:90%
that they don't want to tell us.

00:15:39.140 --> 00:15:42.740 align:middle line:84%
So extraterrestrial life
is connected to the answer

00:15:42.740 --> 00:15:44.090 align:middle line:90%
of where are they?

00:15:44.090 --> 00:15:46.248 align:middle line:84%
And this is where it's
going to sound crazy.

00:15:46.248 --> 00:15:48.290 align:middle line:84%
And I don't have proof
for what I'm going to say.

00:15:48.290 --> 00:15:50.090 align:middle line:84%
So if you happen to
speak to somebody

00:15:50.090 --> 00:15:51.320 align:middle line:84%
that doesn't agree
with you, this probably

00:15:51.320 --> 00:15:52.820 align:middle line:84%
won't be the best
thing to bring up.

00:15:52.820 --> 00:15:54.320 align:middle line:84%
I'm just going to
share it because I

00:15:54.320 --> 00:15:56.300 align:middle line:84%
know a lot of us over
here are like-minded.

00:15:56.300 --> 00:16:00.290 align:middle line:84%
There are certain races that
work with the organization.

00:16:00.290 --> 00:16:02.600 align:middle line:84%
The organization is not just
made up of human beings.

00:16:02.600 --> 00:16:05.060 align:middle line:84%
The organization is made
up of other races as well

00:16:05.060 --> 00:16:07.770 align:middle line:84%
and yes, there are other
extraterrestrial races

00:16:07.770 --> 00:16:08.570 align:middle line:90%
in this universe.

00:16:08.570 --> 00:16:09.180 align:middle line:90%
We know it.

00:16:09.180 --> 00:16:09.980 align:middle line:90%
We've seen it.

00:16:09.980 --> 00:16:11.233 align:middle line:90%
It's been acknowledged.

00:16:11.233 --> 00:16:12.650 align:middle line:84%
The only question
at this point is

00:16:12.650 --> 00:16:13.970 align:middle line:84%
what are their
intentions, which we'll

00:16:13.970 --> 00:16:15.260 align:middle line:90%
speak about in just a second.

00:16:15.260 --> 00:16:17.060 align:middle line:90%
How does their technology work?

00:16:17.060 --> 00:16:19.760 align:middle line:90%
Why are they here?

00:16:19.760 --> 00:16:22.010 align:middle line:84%
TLS works with three
races, specifically

00:16:22.010 --> 00:16:26.450 align:middle line:84%
that I know of: Tzia,
Nashia, and Konom.

00:16:26.450 --> 00:16:28.610 align:middle line:84%
Let's talk about Tzia
and Nashia for a second.

00:16:28.610 --> 00:16:30.350 align:middle line:84%
A lot of people said, Jason,
you're coming up with names

00:16:30.350 --> 00:16:31.460 align:middle line:90%
we never heard of before.

00:16:31.460 --> 00:16:32.660 align:middle line:90%
How do we know it's real?

00:16:32.660 --> 00:16:36.410 align:middle line:84%
Well, go read the Zohar, it was
written thousands of years ago.

00:16:36.410 --> 00:16:39.020 align:middle line:84%
It speaks about Tzia and
Nashia before you ever heard

00:16:39.020 --> 00:16:41.180 align:middle line:90%
the word reptilian or Grey.

00:16:41.180 --> 00:16:43.730 align:middle line:84%
There's more credibility
to Tzia and Nashia

00:16:43.730 --> 00:16:46.700 align:middle line:84%
in terms of our scriptures
and what's actually

00:16:46.700 --> 00:16:49.130 align:middle line:84%
been written and
documented in history

00:16:49.130 --> 00:16:51.140 align:middle line:84%
than there is to
what's been coming out

00:16:51.140 --> 00:16:54.230 align:middle line:84%
over the past few decades with
Greys and reptilians and all

00:16:54.230 --> 00:16:56.480 align:middle line:84%
that because those
names came first.

00:16:56.480 --> 00:16:58.400 align:middle line:90%
Those descriptions came first.

00:16:58.400 --> 00:17:00.720 align:middle line:84%
The awareness of those
planets came first.

00:17:00.720 --> 00:17:02.720 align:middle line:84%
So I don't have that over
here to show you guys,

00:17:02.720 --> 00:17:03.970 align:middle line:90%
but you guys can look that up.

00:17:03.970 --> 00:17:06.260 align:middle line:84%
If I did, it would be in
Hebrew or even Aramaic,

00:17:06.260 --> 00:17:07.760 align:middle line:90%
which I don't know how to read.

00:17:07.760 --> 00:17:12.050 align:middle line:84%
But all of that is talking about
Tzia and Nashia, specifically.

00:17:12.050 --> 00:17:15.170 align:middle line:84%
Those three races
among others I'm sure.

00:17:15.170 --> 00:17:18.500 align:middle line:84%
But I know about those three
races work with the organization

00:17:18.500 --> 00:17:22.319 align:middle line:84%
just like-- and this goes
into intergalactic unity.

00:17:22.319 --> 00:17:26.087 align:middle line:84%
Just like there are
allies between countries.

00:17:26.087 --> 00:17:28.170 align:middle line:84%
And I think that that's a
bunch of BS, by the way,

00:17:28.170 --> 00:17:29.503 align:middle line:90%
but we're not going to go there.

00:17:29.503 --> 00:17:32.250 align:middle line:84%
Just like there are allies
between countries that are here

00:17:32.250 --> 00:17:35.040 align:middle line:84%
to help each other and support
each other in times of wars,

00:17:35.040 --> 00:17:38.010 align:middle line:84%
it's really a whole political
game to take over the world.

00:17:38.010 --> 00:17:40.560 align:middle line:84%
But again, not the point
of this conversation.

00:17:40.560 --> 00:17:44.160 align:middle line:84%
There are also allies
between planets.

00:17:44.160 --> 00:17:46.870 align:middle line:84%
They have been here
for a very long time.

00:17:46.870 --> 00:17:48.840 align:middle line:84%
How many of you can
agree with the fact

00:17:48.840 --> 00:17:52.170 align:middle line:84%
that there was probably an
extraterrestrial presence

00:17:52.170 --> 00:17:55.680 align:middle line:84%
during the time of ancient Egypt
and all the other times where

00:17:55.680 --> 00:17:57.660 align:middle line:84%
all these crazy
structures were built?

00:17:57.660 --> 00:17:59.910 align:middle line:84%
Raise your hand if you agree
with something like that.

00:17:59.910 --> 00:18:02.500 align:middle line:84%
I think most of us do in this
room because it's obvious.

00:18:02.500 --> 00:18:03.300 align:middle line:90%
We see it.

00:18:03.300 --> 00:18:03.870 align:middle line:90%
It's written.

00:18:03.870 --> 00:18:04.670 align:middle line:90%
It's drawn.

00:18:04.670 --> 00:18:06.130 align:middle line:84%
It's the hieroglyphics
on the wall.

00:18:06.130 --> 00:18:07.990 align:middle line:90%
They're showing us the story.

00:18:07.990 --> 00:18:10.080 align:middle line:84%
So if they've been
here 3,000 years ago,

00:18:10.080 --> 00:18:12.900 align:middle line:84%
this isn't a game of disclosure
of the past 70 years.

00:18:12.900 --> 00:18:15.240 align:middle line:84%
They've been here
for a very long time.

00:18:15.240 --> 00:18:16.920 align:middle line:84%
And I'll ask you
guys to think about

00:18:16.920 --> 00:18:21.460 align:middle line:84%
how do we define alien
or extraterrestrial?

00:18:21.460 --> 00:18:23.230 align:middle line:84%
What makes you
different from them?

00:18:23.230 --> 00:18:25.120 align:middle line:84%
What makes me
different from them?

00:18:25.120 --> 00:18:28.240 align:middle line:84%
The fact that we don't know that
they exist because if you've

00:18:28.240 --> 00:18:31.040 align:middle line:84%
never seen a Brown
person before,

00:18:31.040 --> 00:18:33.070 align:middle line:84%
and they were only white
people in the place

00:18:33.070 --> 00:18:37.480 align:middle line:84%
that you were in, then imagine
suddenly you saw a Brown person.

00:18:37.480 --> 00:18:40.270 align:middle line:84%
Imagine you've never
heard of an Asian before.

00:18:40.270 --> 00:18:43.360 align:middle line:84%
And I told you there
is this nation.

00:18:43.360 --> 00:18:47.170 align:middle line:90%
Let's go to the Africans.

00:18:47.170 --> 00:18:49.330 align:middle line:90%
There is this nation of--

00:18:49.330 --> 00:18:51.730 align:middle line:90%
they're generally much taller.

00:18:51.730 --> 00:18:55.720 align:middle line:84%
And they have these
features that are

00:18:55.720 --> 00:18:57.340 align:middle line:90%
different than Asian people.

00:18:57.340 --> 00:18:59.290 align:middle line:90%
They have bigger lips.

00:18:59.290 --> 00:19:00.860 align:middle line:90%
They look different.

00:19:00.860 --> 00:19:01.850 align:middle line:10%
They operate different.

00:19:01.850 --> 00:19:04.000 align:middle line:84%
They have different hair
than people in Europe.

00:19:04.000 --> 00:19:07.505 align:middle line:84%
If you've never been to
Africa, that's an alien to you.

00:19:07.505 --> 00:19:08.880 align:middle line:84%
So I want you guys
to understand,

00:19:08.880 --> 00:19:11.370 align:middle line:84%
we are all living amongst
each other already.

00:19:11.370 --> 00:19:14.888 align:middle line:84%
If you think diversity came
over here out of an amoeba that

00:19:14.888 --> 00:19:17.430 align:middle line:84%
split and then turned into a
fish, that became a lizard, that

00:19:17.430 --> 00:19:20.310 align:middle line:84%
turned to a monkey,
that became a human,

00:19:20.310 --> 00:19:22.800 align:middle line:84%
there's a much more
plausible story,

00:19:22.800 --> 00:19:25.890 align:middle line:84%
and it's that there is
interbreeding between races.

00:19:25.890 --> 00:19:27.960 align:middle line:84%
And the interbreeding
between races

00:19:27.960 --> 00:19:30.450 align:middle line:84%
created the diversity
around the world

00:19:30.450 --> 00:19:33.630 align:middle line:84%
because there really is
no way for a Black person

00:19:33.630 --> 00:19:35.680 align:middle line:90%
to evolve into an Asian.

00:19:35.680 --> 00:19:38.350 align:middle line:84%
And there was no way for an
Asian to evolve into a Black

00:19:38.350 --> 00:19:40.040 align:middle line:90%
person.

00:19:40.040 --> 00:19:41.850 align:middle line:84%
It just doesn't
happen like that.

00:19:41.850 --> 00:19:45.110 align:middle line:84%
And by the way, according to
evolution, how we know it,

00:19:45.110 --> 00:19:46.910 align:middle line:84%
the former should
have been extinct

00:19:46.910 --> 00:19:48.810 align:middle line:84%
because it's survival
of the fittest.

00:19:48.810 --> 00:19:51.382 align:middle line:84%
So I'm making a generalization
over here right now.

00:19:51.382 --> 00:19:53.090 align:middle line:84%
But there's a lot of
different narratives

00:19:53.090 --> 00:19:54.465 align:middle line:84%
that are more
plausible to what's

00:19:54.465 --> 00:19:57.170 align:middle line:84%
going on than the general
narrative, that's brought up

00:19:57.170 --> 00:19:59.837 align:middle line:84%
in our schools, that was taught
to me 10 years ago in my biology

00:19:59.837 --> 00:20:00.637 align:middle line:90%
class.

00:20:00.637 --> 00:20:01.820 align:middle line:90%
Because it never made sense.

00:20:01.820 --> 00:20:03.950 align:middle line:84%
That's why I always
looked into ancient aliens

00:20:03.950 --> 00:20:06.710 align:middle line:84%
and watched those shows because
it made more sense of what

00:20:06.710 --> 00:20:07.920 align:middle line:90%
was really going on here.

00:20:07.920 --> 00:20:10.730 align:middle line:10%
So there is extraterrestrial
life among us,

00:20:10.730 --> 00:20:14.007 align:middle line:10%
and their intentions
are not to harm you.

00:20:14.007 --> 00:20:15.590 align:middle line:84%
Now, I know that
there are some people

00:20:15.590 --> 00:20:17.270 align:middle line:84%
in the room that are
going to say, well,

00:20:17.270 --> 00:20:20.430 align:middle line:90%
there must be good and bad.

00:20:20.430 --> 00:20:22.860 align:middle line:90%
There is good and bad.

00:20:22.860 --> 00:20:25.580 align:middle line:84%
We here on planet
Earth are the bad.

00:20:25.580 --> 00:20:30.410 align:middle line:84%
We're the ones experiencing the
negatively polarized reality

00:20:30.410 --> 00:20:31.430 align:middle line:90%
of this planet.

00:20:31.430 --> 00:20:34.130 align:middle line:84%
The problem is because
we call them them,

00:20:34.130 --> 00:20:36.110 align:middle line:84%
and we call them
extraterrestrials,

00:20:36.110 --> 00:20:40.010 align:middle line:84%
we separate it into another
group other than human beings.

00:20:40.010 --> 00:20:43.280 align:middle line:84%
And we say there must be
negative and positive.

00:20:43.280 --> 00:20:47.030 align:middle line:84%
And we forget that it's
negative and positive.

00:20:47.030 --> 00:20:49.100 align:middle line:90%
It's not us and them.

00:20:49.100 --> 00:20:52.063 align:middle line:84%
Now, we're going to run through
the logic of how we can actually

00:20:52.063 --> 00:20:53.480 align:middle line:84%
make sense of
something like that.

00:20:53.480 --> 00:20:56.720 align:middle line:84%
Before I do, I want to show
you guys one more video.

00:20:56.720 --> 00:20:57.520 align:middle line:90%
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:20:57.520 --> 00:21:00.377 align:middle line:84%
We've spoken about physical
crafts that you've been on.

00:21:00.377 --> 00:21:01.960 align:middle line:10%
>>RAY: The colors
are basically black,

00:21:01.960 --> 00:21:05.725 align:middle line:10%
silver, and white,
mostly silver.

00:21:05.725 --> 00:21:08.440 align:middle line:10%
>>SHURKA: What is the inside of
the craft generally look like?

00:21:08.440 --> 00:21:11.140 align:middle line:10%
>>RAY: The captain might
hold magnets in his hands

00:21:11.140 --> 00:21:13.090 align:middle line:10%
and start moving
stuff with his hands.

00:21:13.090 --> 00:21:14.740 align:middle line:10%
I know you can
move it physically

00:21:14.740 --> 00:21:16.750 align:middle line:10%
with the natural
energy that it has.

00:21:16.750 --> 00:21:19.060 align:middle line:10%
Or you could use
your own body energy.

00:21:19.060 --> 00:21:21.070 align:middle line:10%
>>SHURKA: How many
extraterrestrial races,

00:21:21.070 --> 00:21:23.560 align:middle line:10%
physically speaking,
have you been in contact

00:21:23.560 --> 00:21:24.850 align:middle line:10%
with through TLS?

00:21:24.850 --> 00:21:27.107 align:middle line:10%
I would say about five, six.

00:21:27.107 --> 00:21:29.440 align:middle line:10%
>>SHURKA: Can you explain
their physical characteristics

00:21:29.440 --> 00:21:31.210 align:middle line:10%
for Tzia for the moment?

00:21:31.210 --> 00:21:34.600 align:middle line:10%
>>RAY: They look very
tall, Europeans, big bones.

00:21:34.600 --> 00:21:37.930 align:middle line:10%
They can also communicate
by telepathy, very

00:21:37.930 --> 00:21:43.150 align:middle line:10%
advanced technologically,
but very simple life.

00:21:43.150 --> 00:21:46.070 align:middle line:10%
It's not something
you see on Earth.

00:21:46.070 --> 00:21:50.170 align:middle line:10%
>>SHURKA: When do you feel that
full disclosure will occur?

00:21:50.170 --> 00:21:51.640 align:middle line:10%
>>RAY: In my lifetime.

00:21:51.640 --> 00:21:52.780 align:middle line:10%
No.

00:21:52.780 --> 00:21:54.070 align:middle line:10%
In your lifetime, yes.
