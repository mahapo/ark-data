00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:11.178 align:middle line:90%


00:00:11.178 --> 00:00:13.933 align:middle line:84%
>> So let's talk about
consciousness and tensions

00:00:13.933 --> 00:00:16.350 align:middle line:84%
and technology for a second,
because I don't want you guys

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:19.320 align:middle line:84%
to just hear what I'm saying
without any ammunition that I

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:21.980 align:middle line:84%
can actually give you
to base off of this on.

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:23.690 align:middle line:90%
So here's what we know.

00:00:23.690 --> 00:00:26.100 align:middle line:10%
We know that there
are crafts here

00:00:26.100 --> 00:00:28.110 align:middle line:10%
that defy the laws of physics.

00:00:28.110 --> 00:00:30.060 align:middle line:84%
We know that there
are crafts that move

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:33.220 align:middle line:84%
in ways that our own
physics says is impossible.

00:00:33.220 --> 00:00:36.190 align:middle line:84%
They're going 20,000 miles an
hour and make a sharp left.

00:00:36.190 --> 00:00:38.850 align:middle line:84%
The craft would explode, and
so would every single operator

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:39.700 align:middle line:90%
in that craft.

00:00:39.700 --> 00:00:41.740 align:middle line:84%
We know that because
that's how physics works.

00:00:41.740 --> 00:00:43.440 align:middle line:90%
And yet, they're still doing it.

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:46.170 align:middle line:84%
They're moving at speeds
that are unprecedented,

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:48.510 align:middle line:90%
that are incomprehensible.

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:51.590 align:middle line:84%
So here's the logic, because
I gave you the statement.

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:52.390 align:middle line:90%
Here's the logic.

00:00:52.390 --> 00:00:55.230 align:middle line:84%
The statement is
extraterrestrial life

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:57.300 align:middle line:84%
from elsewhere at
this point in time

00:00:57.300 --> 00:00:59.250 align:middle line:90%
is not negatively polarized.

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:01.390 align:middle line:84%
We'll speak about
reptilians in just a second.

00:01:01.390 --> 00:01:03.270 align:middle line:90%
They fit into this equation.

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:08.160 align:middle line:84%
The logic is this,
if we see crafts

00:01:08.160 --> 00:01:11.110 align:middle line:84%
that are defying the
laws of physics, that

00:01:11.110 --> 00:01:15.910 align:middle line:84%
means that the operators or
the creators of that technology

00:01:15.910 --> 00:01:19.120 align:middle line:84%
have a higher level of awareness
of physics as we know it.

00:01:19.120 --> 00:01:20.740 align:middle line:90%
Does that make sense so far?

00:01:20.740 --> 00:01:25.660 align:middle line:84%
If they have a higher level of
awareness of physics and science

00:01:25.660 --> 00:01:27.760 align:middle line:84%
as we know it, that
means that they're

00:01:27.760 --> 00:01:29.770 align:middle line:90%
much more advanced than we are.

00:01:29.770 --> 00:01:34.000 align:middle line:84%
And there's only two ways that
an advanced civilization can go.

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:39.200 align:middle line:84%
You either wipe yourself
out, or you don't.

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:42.430 align:middle line:84%
What are the implications
of you don't?

00:01:42.430 --> 00:01:45.880 align:middle line:84%
It means that you're
spiritually advanced.

00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:48.250 align:middle line:84%
Today here on
planet Earth, we're

00:01:48.250 --> 00:01:50.170 align:middle line:84%
extremely
technologically advanced.

00:01:50.170 --> 00:01:52.220 align:middle line:90%
And we lack spiritual awareness.

00:01:52.220 --> 00:01:55.820 align:middle line:84%
So we create technology
that hurts us.

00:01:55.820 --> 00:01:58.360 align:middle line:84%
We create technology
that's out of the law,

00:01:58.360 --> 00:02:01.570 align:middle line:84%
out of coherence of the laws
of creation as we know it.

00:02:01.570 --> 00:02:04.910 align:middle line:84%
And therefore, that
technology is destroying us.

00:02:04.910 --> 00:02:07.870 align:middle line:84%
And if we don't raise our
level of spiritual awareness,

00:02:07.870 --> 00:02:11.030 align:middle line:84%
that technology will take us out
just like it did with Atlantis.

00:02:11.030 --> 00:02:12.710 align:middle line:84%
Because Atlantis
is not just a myth.

00:02:12.710 --> 00:02:15.250 align:middle line:84%
There's also scriptures and
written things over there

00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:17.290 align:middle line:90%
to explain what really happened.

00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:20.500 align:middle line:84%
What happened over there,
what's happening right now.

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:26.830 align:middle line:84%
Here's the statement, when
technological development

00:02:26.830 --> 00:02:30.010 align:middle line:84%
surpasses spiritual
development, the technology

00:02:30.010 --> 00:02:31.840 align:middle line:84%
will not be used in
a responsible way

00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:34.960 align:middle line:84%
and the civilization
will wipe themselves out.

00:02:34.960 --> 00:02:39.880 align:middle line:84%
So long as spiritual awareness
advances and surpasses

00:02:39.880 --> 00:02:42.490 align:middle line:84%
the level or at least
is at the same level

00:02:42.490 --> 00:02:46.720 align:middle line:84%
of technological awareness and
technological developments,

00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:50.070 align:middle line:84%
then we will be able to use that
technology in a responsible way.

00:02:50.070 --> 00:02:53.170 align:middle line:84%
The very fact that
they're coming here

00:02:53.170 --> 00:02:56.440 align:middle line:84%
with a technology that
supersedes anything

00:02:56.440 --> 00:02:59.590 align:middle line:84%
that we know and are still
alive and are not attacking

00:02:59.590 --> 00:03:04.480 align:middle line:84%
means that they are an
advanced civilization that

00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:08.980 align:middle line:84%
is advanced both spiritually
and technologically.

00:03:08.980 --> 00:03:12.170 align:middle line:84%
It means they can't be
here to come and hurt you.

00:03:12.170 --> 00:03:14.710 align:middle line:84%
Now I'll give you
another aspect of logic.

00:03:14.710 --> 00:03:16.910 align:middle line:84%
Let's follow the
money for a second.

00:03:16.910 --> 00:03:18.460 align:middle line:10%
Who do they threaten?

00:03:18.460 --> 00:03:21.970 align:middle line:84%
Well, if their technology is
what we think it is, and it is,

00:03:21.970 --> 00:03:24.955 align:middle line:84%
they're using free
energy technology.

00:03:24.955 --> 00:03:27.280 align:middle line:84%
Right now with what's going
on in the Middle East,

00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:29.350 align:middle line:84%
that's really a war
over natural gas.

00:03:29.350 --> 00:03:31.560 align:middle line:84%
If you see countries
fighting against each other

00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:34.830 align:middle line:84%
over natural gas, if
somebody came out today

00:03:34.830 --> 00:03:37.073 align:middle line:84%
with free energy technology,
all those countries,

00:03:37.073 --> 00:03:38.490 align:middle line:84%
the whole world
will come together

00:03:38.490 --> 00:03:42.120 align:middle line:84%
to take out that entity because
they share a common enemy now.

00:03:42.120 --> 00:03:42.940 align:middle line:90%
Why?

00:03:42.940 --> 00:03:46.290 align:middle line:10%
Because free energy
technology will

00:03:46.290 --> 00:03:51.020 align:middle line:10%
dismantle every single
industry on this planet--

00:03:51.020 --> 00:03:54.060 align:middle line:10%
technology,
transportation, medically,

00:03:54.060 --> 00:03:55.660 align:middle line:10%
and so on and so forth.

00:03:55.660 --> 00:03:58.700 align:middle line:84%
Therefore, over
the past 70 years

00:03:58.700 --> 00:04:01.730 align:middle line:84%
of this disclosure that we've
been seeing since what happened

00:04:01.730 --> 00:04:04.400 align:middle line:84%
in Roswell, New Mexico,
for the most part,

00:04:04.400 --> 00:04:08.370 align:middle line:84%
what we've been seeing really
is a narrative being spun.

00:04:08.370 --> 00:04:11.280 align:middle line:84%
First, extraterrestrials
are not real.

00:04:11.280 --> 00:04:12.660 align:middle line:90%
Today they're real.

00:04:12.660 --> 00:04:14.280 align:middle line:90%
They're here, but they're evil.

00:04:14.280 --> 00:04:16.850 align:middle line:84%
They're a threat to
national security.

00:04:16.850 --> 00:04:20.000 align:middle line:84%
Because if you can't get the--
if the people are already

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:21.959 align:middle line:84%
at a point, which
most of the world is,

00:04:21.959 --> 00:04:24.430 align:middle line:84%
they believe that
extraterrestrial life is real,

00:04:24.430 --> 00:04:26.370 align:middle line:84%
they can't lie
about that anymore.

00:04:26.370 --> 00:04:30.080 align:middle line:84%
The next best thing to make sure
that certain people in power

00:04:30.080 --> 00:04:32.960 align:middle line:84%
retain that power is to make us
afraid of the very thing that

00:04:32.960 --> 00:04:34.860 align:middle line:90%
will free us for good.

00:04:34.860 --> 00:04:37.520 align:middle line:84%
Because if free energy
technology was here,

00:04:37.520 --> 00:04:41.810 align:middle line:84%
if free energy technology was
shared and given to the people,

00:04:41.810 --> 00:04:44.630 align:middle line:84%
the world would change
overnight for the better,

00:04:44.630 --> 00:04:46.598 align:middle line:84%
but for the worse
for certain people.

00:04:46.598 --> 00:04:48.390 align:middle line:84%
And that's how we have
to follow the money.

00:04:48.390 --> 00:04:50.820 align:middle line:10%
So where have we ever
heard a narrative

00:04:50.820 --> 00:04:54.060 align:middle line:10%
being spun to be afraid
of extraterrestrial life

00:04:54.060 --> 00:04:54.860 align:middle line:10%
that they're evil?

00:04:54.860 --> 00:04:55.660 align:middle line:90%
Hollywood.

00:04:55.660 --> 00:04:56.710 align:middle line:90%
That's where it started.

00:04:56.710 --> 00:04:57.510 align:middle line:90%
Hollywood.

00:04:57.510 --> 00:04:59.700 align:middle line:84%
Dr, Steven Greer
showed documents

00:04:59.700 --> 00:05:02.550 align:middle line:84%
of the CIA creating
fake abductions

00:05:02.550 --> 00:05:03.953 align:middle line:90%
to make people afraid.

00:05:03.953 --> 00:05:06.120 align:middle line:84%
But they really felt that
that was their experience,

00:05:06.120 --> 00:05:08.740 align:middle line:90%
and they went and shared it.

00:05:08.740 --> 00:05:12.570 align:middle line:84%
Abductions in a negative way
has never happened before.

00:05:12.570 --> 00:05:16.840 align:middle line:84%
Dr. Steven Greer's documents of
what the CIA formulated actually

00:05:16.840 --> 00:05:18.460 align:middle line:90%
came to fruition.

00:05:18.460 --> 00:05:20.650 align:middle line:90%
Invasions never happened either.

00:05:20.650 --> 00:05:23.440 align:middle line:84%
As a matter of fact, if you go
to the incident at the White

00:05:23.440 --> 00:05:24.903 align:middle line:90%
House, the--

00:05:24.903 --> 00:05:26.320 align:middle line:84%
I forgot exactly
what it's called,

00:05:26.320 --> 00:05:28.820 align:middle line:84%
but it's the incident in
the White House in 1954,

00:05:28.820 --> 00:05:29.620 align:middle line:90%
if I believe.

00:05:29.620 --> 00:05:31.900 align:middle line:10%
There were 9 or 12 crafts
over the White House,

00:05:31.900 --> 00:05:34.570 align:middle line:10%
and they sent military jets
after them to go and shoot them

00:05:34.570 --> 00:05:34.780 align:middle line:10%
down.

00:05:34.780 --> 00:05:35.738 align:middle line:90%
You know what they did?

00:05:35.738 --> 00:05:36.610 align:middle line:90%
They retreated.

00:05:36.610 --> 00:05:38.210 align:middle line:90%
What about the invasion?

00:05:38.210 --> 00:05:41.360 align:middle line:84%
The only time we see
invasion is in the movies.

00:05:41.360 --> 00:05:42.760 align:middle line:90%
It's never happened.

00:05:42.760 --> 00:05:44.620 align:middle line:90%
It's never happened.

00:05:44.620 --> 00:05:47.848 align:middle line:84%
So I'm giving you this
logic because I don't just

00:05:47.848 --> 00:05:49.640 align:middle line:84%
want it to be based
off of what I'm saying.

00:05:49.640 --> 00:05:53.350 align:middle line:84%
I want you to guys to understand
how consciousness works

00:05:53.350 --> 00:05:56.958 align:middle line:84%
and how all of this works
when it comes to intentions

00:05:56.958 --> 00:05:58.000 align:middle line:90%
mixed with consciousness.

00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:00.040 align:middle line:84%
If they're at that
level of awareness,

00:06:00.040 --> 00:06:02.390 align:middle line:84%
that resonance
does not know war.

00:06:02.390 --> 00:06:04.700 align:middle line:84%
That resonance does
not know greed.

00:06:04.700 --> 00:06:06.920 align:middle line:84%
That resonance does
not know separation.

00:06:06.920 --> 00:06:09.530 align:middle line:84%
As a matter of fact, when
did they start coming here?

00:06:09.530 --> 00:06:12.435 align:middle line:84%
They started coming here in
terms of the most recent history

00:06:12.435 --> 00:06:14.810 align:middle line:84%
that we know-- because they've
been here for a long time.

00:06:14.810 --> 00:06:16.780 align:middle line:84%
They started coming
here most recently

00:06:16.780 --> 00:06:20.350 align:middle line:84%
during Hiroshima and Nagasaki,
because nuclear bombs are really

00:06:20.350 --> 00:06:21.460 align:middle line:90%
scalar weapons.

00:06:21.460 --> 00:06:24.490 align:middle line:84%
Scalar weapons, scalar energy
is an energy that moves faster

00:06:24.490 --> 00:06:25.820 align:middle line:90%
than the speed of light.

00:06:25.820 --> 00:06:28.120 align:middle line:84%
And when you weaponize
something that moves faster

00:06:28.120 --> 00:06:29.262 align:middle line:90%
than the speed of light--

00:06:29.262 --> 00:06:31.720 align:middle line:84%
and I know that that's hard
for some physicists in the room

00:06:31.720 --> 00:06:35.180 align:middle line:84%
because that's not something
that's exactly accepted.

00:06:35.180 --> 00:06:37.480 align:middle line:84%
But when you create something
that operates faster

00:06:37.480 --> 00:06:40.540 align:middle line:84%
than the speed of light, it's
an interdimensional warfare

00:06:40.540 --> 00:06:41.420 align:middle line:90%
that you're creating.

00:06:41.420 --> 00:06:43.462 align:middle line:84%
You're now impacting
something that's potentially

00:06:43.462 --> 00:06:44.780 align:middle line:90%
a billion light years away.

00:06:44.780 --> 00:06:46.910 align:middle line:84%
That's when extraterrestrial
life comes in.

00:06:46.910 --> 00:06:49.420 align:middle line:84%
There's a reason why
extraterrestrial life has

00:06:49.420 --> 00:06:52.960 align:middle line:84%
been seen shutting down nuclear
missile bases over the past 50,

00:06:52.960 --> 00:06:56.110 align:middle line:84%
60 years-- because that's a
threat not just to planet Earth,

00:06:56.110 --> 00:06:57.800 align:middle line:90%
but to the universe as a whole.

00:06:57.800 --> 00:07:00.220 align:middle line:84%
It's starting to go
interdimensionally

00:07:00.220 --> 00:07:04.460 align:middle line:84%
because of scalar weaponry and
how that technology is used.

00:07:04.460 --> 00:07:07.208 align:middle line:84%
But scalar energy can be used
in a very good way, which

00:07:07.208 --> 00:07:09.250 align:middle line:84%
is what this is all about,
which I'll speak about

00:07:09.250 --> 00:07:10.310 align:middle line:90%
in just a second.

00:07:10.310 --> 00:07:13.580 align:middle line:10%
So again, now
comes the question,

00:07:13.580 --> 00:07:16.840 align:middle line:10%
if what I'm saying is true
and if it makes sense,

00:07:16.840 --> 00:07:20.820 align:middle line:10%
there's a very big elephant in
the room, what about reptilians?

00:07:20.820 --> 00:07:24.560 align:middle line:84%
What about that whole race that
many people have experienced,

00:07:24.560 --> 00:07:29.070 align:middle line:84%
that people are coming and
saying, they're evil ETs?

00:07:29.070 --> 00:07:30.280 align:middle line:90%
And that's this slide.

00:07:30.280 --> 00:07:31.530 align:middle line:90%
No, it's not.

00:07:31.530 --> 00:07:32.730 align:middle line:90%
That's this slide.

00:07:32.730 --> 00:07:35.340 align:middle line:84%
And then I'll show you that
video in just a second.

00:07:35.340 --> 00:07:38.900 align:middle line:90%
If you ask the organization--

00:07:38.900 --> 00:07:40.920 align:middle line:84%
first, let's step
back for a second.

00:07:40.920 --> 00:07:44.570 align:middle line:84%
A lot of people, couple
with reptilian life,

00:07:44.570 --> 00:07:46.370 align:middle line:90%
this idea of shape-shifting.

00:07:46.370 --> 00:07:49.290 align:middle line:84%
Shape-shifting, let's
ground that for a second.

00:07:49.290 --> 00:07:53.038 align:middle line:84%
If a caterpillar can
turn into a butterfly,

00:07:53.038 --> 00:07:54.830 align:middle line:84%
that means that
shape-shifting is something

00:07:54.830 --> 00:07:56.100 align:middle line:90%
that happens in nature.

00:07:56.100 --> 00:07:57.870 align:middle line:84%
It's two completely
different things.

00:07:57.870 --> 00:07:59.550 align:middle line:90%
Caterpillar is not a butterfly.

00:07:59.550 --> 00:08:02.870 align:middle line:84%
Literally goes through a
metamorphosis to shift its form,

00:08:02.870 --> 00:08:05.520 align:middle line:84%
to go from something that
walks to something that flies.

00:08:05.520 --> 00:08:07.850 align:middle line:84%
It uses a different
medium of transportation

00:08:07.850 --> 00:08:09.690 align:middle line:90%
after its metamorphosis.

00:08:09.690 --> 00:08:12.200 align:middle line:84%
So we know that it's
possible in nature.

00:08:12.200 --> 00:08:13.820 align:middle line:84%
And a lot of people,
when it comes

00:08:13.820 --> 00:08:16.970 align:middle line:84%
to the reptilians or
the reptilian race

00:08:16.970 --> 00:08:19.830 align:middle line:84%
have coupled or associated
shapeshifting with that.

00:08:19.830 --> 00:08:21.510 align:middle line:84%
And suddenly,
shape-shifters are bad.

00:08:21.510 --> 00:08:22.670 align:middle line:90%
It's not true.

00:08:22.670 --> 00:08:25.100 align:middle line:84%
There are individuals
that have that ability,

00:08:25.100 --> 00:08:26.527 align:middle line:90%
and they're human beings.

00:08:26.527 --> 00:08:28.610 align:middle line:84%
They're just a different
race within human beings,

00:08:28.610 --> 00:08:30.670 align:middle line:84%
just like there are Black
people and white people.

00:08:30.670 --> 00:08:31.590 align:middle line:90%
What's the difference?

00:08:31.590 --> 00:08:32.820 align:middle line:90%
We have different genetics.

00:08:32.820 --> 00:08:35.809 align:middle line:84%
So there are different genetics
to individuals that are

00:08:35.809 --> 00:08:37.380 align:middle line:90%
able to do something like that.

00:08:37.380 --> 00:08:40.326 align:middle line:84%
And some of those people will
operate in a negative way,

00:08:40.326 --> 00:08:42.659 align:middle line:84%
and some of those people will
operate in a positive way.

00:08:42.659 --> 00:08:46.740 align:middle line:84%
As a matter of fact, the head
of the New York chapter of TLS

00:08:46.740 --> 00:08:48.820 align:middle line:90%
has the ability to shape-shift.

00:08:48.820 --> 00:08:51.270 align:middle line:84%
She was brought in when
she was 23 years old.

00:08:51.270 --> 00:08:54.120 align:middle line:84%
She was helped to develop
that genetic marker that she

00:08:54.120 --> 00:08:57.120 align:middle line:84%
has within her body, and she can
shift into different forms as

00:08:57.120 --> 00:08:58.470 align:middle line:90%
crazy as that sounds.

00:08:58.470 --> 00:09:00.600 align:middle line:84%
What it's really
doing is just changing

00:09:00.600 --> 00:09:03.240 align:middle line:84%
in a very quick way the
density of your body

00:09:03.240 --> 00:09:06.120 align:middle line:84%
to be able to become less
dense, to shift the form,

00:09:06.120 --> 00:09:08.250 align:middle line:84%
and redensify, if you
want to call that.

00:09:08.250 --> 00:09:11.130 align:middle line:84%
When you do that, you
can shift your form.

00:09:11.130 --> 00:09:14.130 align:middle line:84%
Shapeshifting does
not equate reptilian.

00:09:14.130 --> 00:09:17.050 align:middle line:90%
Reptilian is a race within--

00:09:17.050 --> 00:09:18.000 align:middle line:90%
it comes from here.

00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:21.810 align:middle line:84%
At this point in life, it
comes from planet Earth.

00:09:21.810 --> 00:09:24.330 align:middle line:84%
Now was there a
point-- or could there

00:09:24.330 --> 00:09:26.760 align:middle line:84%
have been a point in
the past where they've

00:09:26.760 --> 00:09:28.120 align:middle line:90%
come from a different planet?

00:09:28.120 --> 00:09:30.570 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, you guys think you don't
come from different planets

00:09:30.570 --> 00:09:31.450 align:middle line:90%
in the past?

00:09:31.450 --> 00:09:35.350 align:middle line:84%
We all have different origins
of where we come from.

00:09:35.350 --> 00:09:37.020 align:middle line:84%
The point over here--
and this is now

00:09:37.020 --> 00:09:39.240 align:middle line:84%
me being the spokesperson
for the organization

00:09:39.240 --> 00:09:41.140 align:middle line:84%
because it's a very
important statement.

00:09:41.140 --> 00:09:43.690 align:middle line:84%
One of their goals is
intergalactic unity.

00:09:43.690 --> 00:09:46.350 align:middle line:84%
We will not be able to
reach intergalactic unity

00:09:46.350 --> 00:09:48.300 align:middle line:84%
so long as we're
afraid of a race that

00:09:48.300 --> 00:09:50.920 align:middle line:84%
doesn't exist in the way that
we've been told they exist.

00:09:50.920 --> 00:09:53.100 align:middle line:84%
They are not ETs coming
from somewhere else

00:09:53.100 --> 00:09:54.340 align:middle line:90%
to come and kill you.

00:09:54.340 --> 00:09:59.310 align:middle line:84%
They're races that may have been
extraterrestrial at some point,

00:09:59.310 --> 00:10:03.270 align:middle line:84%
as we all probably have at some
point, that are inbred within us

00:10:03.270 --> 00:10:05.670 align:middle line:84%
that have a different
consciousness, that

00:10:05.670 --> 00:10:07.450 align:middle line:90%
operate in different ways.

00:10:07.450 --> 00:10:09.760 align:middle line:84%
As a matter of fact, we
all have a reptilian brain.

00:10:09.760 --> 00:10:11.920 align:middle line:84%
Our hindbrain is
a reptilian brain.

00:10:11.920 --> 00:10:15.270 align:middle line:84%
We share that brain with
reptiles, with lizards,

00:10:15.270 --> 00:10:16.600 align:middle line:90%
and so on and so forth.

00:10:16.600 --> 00:10:18.730 align:middle line:84%
And that brain
operates out of fear.

00:10:18.730 --> 00:10:20.200 align:middle line:90%
It's a lower resonance.

00:10:20.200 --> 00:10:24.000 align:middle line:84%
That lower resonance will
cause you to go and do things

00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:28.230 align:middle line:84%
like war or corruption
or greed or murder

00:10:28.230 --> 00:10:31.230 align:middle line:84%
or whatever it may be
and not really care

00:10:31.230 --> 00:10:33.520 align:middle line:84%
because you're coming from
a different resonance.

00:10:33.520 --> 00:10:37.355 align:middle line:84%
It's all a game of consciousness
and energies and resonances.

00:10:37.355 --> 00:10:39.480 align:middle line:84%
When you're coming from a
lower dimensional thought

00:10:39.480 --> 00:10:42.090 align:middle line:84%
process, a lower
dimensional consciousness,

00:10:42.090 --> 00:10:43.930 align:middle line:90%
you will do things like that.

00:10:43.930 --> 00:10:46.200 align:middle line:84%
At this point, we've
been infiltrated,

00:10:46.200 --> 00:10:48.150 align:middle line:84%
because look at the
world around us.

00:10:48.150 --> 00:10:51.550 align:middle line:84%
Reptilian or not,
we're all doing that.

00:10:51.550 --> 00:10:54.330 align:middle line:10%
Maybe not us in this room,
but the collective right now

00:10:54.330 --> 00:10:55.900 align:middle line:10%
is in a state of war.

00:10:55.900 --> 00:10:57.540 align:middle line:84%
And if we want to
overcome that, we

00:10:57.540 --> 00:11:00.280 align:middle line:84%
have to understand the
mechanism by which this occurred

00:11:00.280 --> 00:11:01.540 align:middle line:90%
so we can break out of that.

00:11:01.540 --> 00:11:04.450 align:middle line:84%
Just like if you're in a
prison, how do you break out?

00:11:04.450 --> 00:11:05.620 align:middle line:90%
I give you the blueprint.

00:11:05.620 --> 00:11:08.070 align:middle line:84%
If you have the blueprint
of how the prison was built,

00:11:08.070 --> 00:11:09.930 align:middle line:84%
you have the blueprint
and the key of how

00:11:09.930 --> 00:11:12.030 align:middle line:90%
to break out of that prison.

00:11:12.030 --> 00:11:14.460 align:middle line:84%
If anybody watched the movie--
or the show "Prison Break,"

00:11:14.460 --> 00:11:15.550 align:middle line:90%
that's how he did it.

00:11:15.550 --> 00:11:19.200 align:middle line:84%
Michael Schofield broke into the
prison, but he was an architect.

00:11:19.200 --> 00:11:22.690 align:middle line:10%
So he broke into the prison
with blueprints beforehand.

00:11:22.690 --> 00:11:23.898 align:middle line:10%
And he studied that prison.

00:11:23.898 --> 00:11:25.440 align:middle line:84%
And how did he break
into the prison?

00:11:25.440 --> 00:11:27.830 align:middle line:84%
He committed a crime in order
to break his brother out.

00:11:27.830 --> 00:11:29.580 align:middle line:10%
And he went into the
jail that his brother

00:11:29.580 --> 00:11:31.830 align:middle line:10%
was in with the intention
of breaking his brother out,

00:11:31.830 --> 00:11:35.250 align:middle line:10%
all because he had the
blueprints of the prison.

00:11:35.250 --> 00:11:38.040 align:middle line:84%
One of the keys of what TLS is
trying to bring to the table

00:11:38.040 --> 00:11:40.710 align:middle line:84%
here is to bring the
blueprints of how all of this

00:11:40.710 --> 00:11:43.530 align:middle line:84%
works to humanity so we
can use our own free will

game of hot and cold

00:11:47.400 --> 00:11:50.440 align:middle line:84%
or trial and error with a
blindfold on, we have guidance.

00:11:50.440 --> 00:11:52.225 align:middle line:84%
And if we have
guidance, we can shift

00:11:52.225 --> 00:11:53.350 align:middle line:90%
how that whole thing works.

00:13:30.898 --> 00:13:32.440 align:middle line:84%
I got food on my
table for my family,

00:13:32.440 --> 00:13:33.950 align:middle line:84%
and that's all I
really care about.

00:13:33.950 --> 00:13:35.080 align:middle line:90%
But are you?

00:13:35.080 --> 00:13:39.412 align:middle line:84%
Because if a part of your being
on the other side of the planet

00:13:39.412 --> 00:13:40.870 align:middle line:84%
is hurting and you
don't feel that,

00:13:40.870 --> 00:13:42.245 align:middle line:84%
that just means
that you're numb.

00:13:42.245 --> 00:13:43.840 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't mean
that you're good.

00:13:43.840 --> 00:13:46.240 align:middle line:84%
The difference between
extraterrestrial life

00:13:46.240 --> 00:13:48.520 align:middle line:84%
and us here on planet
Earth as a collective

00:13:48.520 --> 00:13:51.160 align:middle line:84%
is that they can feel what's
going on the other side,

00:13:51.160 --> 00:13:53.660 align:middle line:84%
because they're tapped
into universal awareness.

00:13:53.660 --> 00:13:57.400 align:middle line:84%
That's the key of TLS is to
bring in universal awareness

00:13:57.400 --> 00:13:59.600 align:middle line:84%
back into the consciousness
of we, the people.

00:13:59.600 --> 00:14:02.408 align:middle line:84%
Because if we can move back
into universal awareness, when

00:14:02.408 --> 00:14:04.450 align:middle line:84%
something happens on the
other side of the planet

00:14:04.450 --> 00:14:07.030 align:middle line:84%
or on the other side of the
universe, you will feel it.

00:14:07.030 --> 00:14:08.530 align:middle line:84%
You won't be able
to sleep at night,

00:14:08.530 --> 00:14:10.330 align:middle line:84%
just like you can't sleep
at night when you have

00:14:10.330 --> 00:14:11.660 align:middle line:90%
an infection in your pinky toe.

00:14:11.660 --> 00:14:14.740 align:middle line:10%
So is there an agenda
to keep us afraid

00:14:14.740 --> 00:14:16.340 align:middle line:10%
and away from
extraterrestrial life?

00:14:16.340 --> 00:14:18.890 align:middle line:10%
And that's what I said
about follow the money.

00:14:18.890 --> 00:14:21.280 align:middle line:10%
It's about understanding
how certain narratives are

00:14:21.280 --> 00:14:24.050 align:middle line:10%
being drawn in order
to get people afraid.

00:14:24.050 --> 00:14:26.620 align:middle line:10%
There's a video I want
to show, and then we're

00:14:26.620 --> 00:14:28.750 align:middle line:10%
going to get moving into
this with the 20 minutes

00:14:28.750 --> 00:14:30.650 align:middle line:10%
that we have left.

00:14:30.650 --> 00:14:33.950 align:middle line:84%
This is very important to
understand certain narratives

00:14:33.950 --> 00:14:36.490 align:middle line:84%
and how to break through those
narratives through awareness.

00:14:36.490 --> 00:14:37.290 align:middle line:90%
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:14:37.290 --> 00:14:39.248 align:middle line:84%
>> You're speaking about
what many people refer

00:14:39.248 --> 00:14:41.220 align:middle line:90%
to as Operation Blue Beam.

00:14:41.220 --> 00:14:44.690 align:middle line:84%
>> There's an operation called
the Phoenix Light Project.

00:14:44.690 --> 00:14:48.230 align:middle line:10%
Tens of thousands of people
witness to a craft about a mile

00:14:48.230 --> 00:14:50.250 align:middle line:10%
long, a mile in the sky.

00:14:50.250 --> 00:14:51.350 align:middle line:10%
People saw it.

00:14:51.350 --> 00:14:52.910 align:middle line:10%
This is a hologram.

00:14:52.910 --> 00:14:54.680 align:middle line:10%
You're looking at a hologram.

00:14:54.680 --> 00:14:55.800 align:middle line:10%
It's so real.

00:14:55.800 --> 00:14:59.900 align:middle line:10%
You feel you could
reach out and touch it.

00:14:59.900 --> 00:15:02.210 align:middle line:10%
Over 10,000 witnesses saw that.

00:15:02.210 --> 00:15:04.290 align:middle line:10%
They believe they
saw an aircraft.

00:15:04.290 --> 00:15:05.730 align:middle line:10%
The ETs are coming.

00:15:05.730 --> 00:15:07.670 align:middle line:10%
Now imagine tomorrow,
you're going

00:15:07.670 --> 00:15:09.540 align:middle line:10%
to see thousands of aircraft.

00:15:09.540 --> 00:15:12.590 align:middle line:10%
That is big, smaller,
but aircrafts

00:15:12.590 --> 00:15:16.380 align:middle line:10%
coming in, flying all over the
United States, Europe, whatever

00:15:16.380 --> 00:15:17.180 align:middle line:10%
it is.

00:15:17.180 --> 00:15:19.190 align:middle line:10%
And then you're
going to be attacked.

00:15:19.190 --> 00:15:21.410 align:middle line:10%
But those attacks will
happen with real missiles

00:15:21.410 --> 00:15:22.250 align:middle line:10%
or real planes.

00:15:22.250 --> 00:15:23.050 align:middle line:10%
You understand?

00:15:23.050 --> 00:15:24.925 align:middle line:10%
They're going to say,
my government is right.

00:15:24.925 --> 00:15:25.980 align:middle line:10%
They want to protect me.

00:15:25.980 --> 00:15:27.650 align:middle line:10%
You declare an emergency.

00:15:27.650 --> 00:15:29.810 align:middle line:10%
You declare one
world government.

00:15:29.810 --> 00:15:31.610 align:middle line:10%
Nobody will resist.

00:15:31.610 --> 00:15:33.890 align:middle line:10%
People will say thank you.

00:15:33.890 --> 00:15:36.486 align:middle line:10%
And that's how you take over.

00:15:36.486 --> 00:15:37.575 align:middle line:10%
>> Wow.

00:15:37.575 --> 00:15:41.140 align:middle line:10%
>> They have the technology that
can do this tomorrow morning.

00:15:41.140 --> 00:15:42.870 align:middle line:10%
The information
that you were being

00:15:42.870 --> 00:15:47.310 align:middle line:10%
fed that bad ETs are coming
to get you, nonsense, all BS,

00:15:47.310 --> 00:15:49.151 align:middle line:10%
doesn't exist.

00:15:49.151 --> 00:15:49.951 align:middle line:90%
[END PLAYBACK]

00:15:49.951 --> 00:15:53.130 align:middle line:84%
>> They cannot do that
if we're aware of it.

00:15:53.130 --> 00:15:54.730 align:middle line:90%
That's how you foil a plan.

00:15:54.730 --> 00:15:56.510 align:middle line:10%
They can only do
something, something

00:15:56.510 --> 00:15:59.130 align:middle line:10%
like that if we have
a lack of awareness.

00:15:59.130 --> 00:16:01.820 align:middle line:84%
So again, the principle that
I'm trying to share here

00:16:01.820 --> 00:16:04.710 align:middle line:84%
is through awareness,
we become free.

00:16:04.710 --> 00:16:08.090 align:middle line:84%
Through universal awareness,
we experience peace.

00:16:08.090 --> 00:16:10.580 align:middle line:84%
That's the key of
shedding light on what's

00:16:10.580 --> 00:16:12.600 align:middle line:90%
going on all around this world.

00:16:12.600 --> 00:16:16.200 align:middle line:84%
It's not to enhance and
make the dark more powerful.

00:16:16.200 --> 00:16:17.947 align:middle line:84%
It's to illuminate
the dark with light.

00:16:17.947 --> 00:16:20.280 align:middle line:84%
Because if you try to fight
it, you're not going to win.

00:16:20.280 --> 00:16:22.580 align:middle line:84%
If you simply turn the
light on in the room,

00:16:22.580 --> 00:16:25.670 align:middle line:84%
that darkness dissipates--
because light is much,

00:16:25.670 --> 00:16:27.610 align:middle line:90%
much stronger than darkness.

00:16:27.610 --> 00:16:29.360 align:middle line:84%
The last thing I want
to speak about today

00:16:29.360 --> 00:16:31.820 align:middle line:84%
is TLS UNIFYD
Healing and EESystem

00:16:31.820 --> 00:16:34.760 align:middle line:84%
to show you guys the power
of this organization,

00:16:34.760 --> 00:16:37.558 align:middle line:84%
because they're the reason
why this thing exists

00:16:37.558 --> 00:16:38.850 align:middle line:90%
all around the world right now.

00:16:38.850 --> 00:16:41.885 align:middle line:84%
As a matter of fact, it
started in Las Vegas.

00:16:41.885 --> 00:16:43.760 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to tell this
story as fast as I can

00:16:43.760 --> 00:16:46.850 align:middle line:90%
because I have 15 minutes left.

00:16:46.850 --> 00:16:53.700 align:middle line:84%
In April of 2022, I
put on a virtual event

00:16:53.700 --> 00:16:55.173 align:middle line:90%
called The Shift on UNIFYD TV.

00:16:55.173 --> 00:16:57.090 align:middle line:84%
One of the interviewers
and hosts of the shift

00:16:57.090 --> 00:16:58.050 align:middle line:90%
is Scott McKay.

00:16:58.050 --> 00:17:00.770 align:middle line:84%
He was interviewing a couple
by the name of Ty and Charlene

00:17:00.770 --> 00:17:01.570 align:middle line:90%
Bollinger.

00:17:01.570 --> 00:17:04.440 align:middle line:84%
One of the disinformation
dozen that the White House said

00:17:04.440 --> 00:17:06.599 align:middle line:84%
are one of the 12
most dangerous people

00:17:06.599 --> 00:17:09.305 align:middle line:84%
on this planet because they
were sharing awareness of what

00:17:09.305 --> 00:17:10.680 align:middle line:84%
was going on,
medically speaking,

00:17:10.680 --> 00:17:12.190 align:middle line:90%
around the world at that time.

00:17:12.190 --> 00:17:14.260 align:middle line:84%
They were a threat
to people in power.

00:17:14.260 --> 00:17:17.910 align:middle line:84%
In that interview, my family
was watching that interview.

00:17:17.910 --> 00:17:20.940 align:middle line:84%
And he was speaking
about-- and Scott McKay

00:17:20.940 --> 00:17:23.250 align:middle line:84%
was speaking about this
technology and this doctor that

00:17:23.250 --> 00:17:25.500 align:middle line:84%
lives in Las Vegas 10,
15 minutes from here,

00:17:25.500 --> 00:17:28.900 align:middle line:84%
Dr. Sandra Rose Michael,
inventor of the EESystem.

00:17:28.900 --> 00:17:30.010 align:middle line:90%
I never heard about this.

00:17:30.010 --> 00:17:31.500 align:middle line:84%
I wasn't watching the
interview, as a matter

00:17:31.500 --> 00:17:33.840 align:middle line:84%
of fact, because I was doing
other things logistically

00:17:33.840 --> 00:17:34.720 align:middle line:90%
for that event.

00:17:34.720 --> 00:17:35.800 align:middle line:90%
But my family was.

00:17:35.800 --> 00:17:39.510 align:middle line:84%
And at the time, my aunt had
a 13 and 1/2-centimeter cystic

00:17:39.510 --> 00:17:41.010 align:middle line:90%
fibroid in her uterus.

00:17:41.010 --> 00:17:43.780 align:middle line:84%
And doctors were saying,
you've got to go do surgery,

00:17:43.780 --> 00:17:45.550 align:middle line:84%
it could be cancer,
it could be this.

00:17:45.550 --> 00:17:47.160 align:middle line:84%
And my family likes
going alternative

00:17:47.160 --> 00:17:49.270 align:middle line:84%
before we go into
Western medicine.

00:17:49.270 --> 00:17:52.020 align:middle line:84%
I think Western medicine
holds a very important role

00:17:52.020 --> 00:17:53.400 align:middle line:84%
in the world, but
it's completely

00:17:53.400 --> 00:17:55.460 align:middle line:84%
out of proportion in
terms of what we're doing

00:17:55.460 --> 00:17:56.710 align:middle line:90%
and how we're dealing with it.

00:17:56.710 --> 00:17:59.340 align:middle line:84%
So we always like trying other
things before going, hey,

00:17:59.340 --> 00:18:00.892 align:middle line:84%
let's remove this
thing from you,

00:18:00.892 --> 00:18:03.100 align:middle line:84%
because that's obviously
not the root of the problem.

00:18:03.100 --> 00:18:06.125 align:middle line:84%
So my family asked me,
specifically my father--

00:18:06.125 --> 00:18:07.500 align:middle line:84%
my father or my
mother called me.

00:18:07.500 --> 00:18:09.880 align:middle line:84%
And they're like, what's
going on with this technology?

00:18:09.880 --> 00:18:12.390 align:middle line:84%
Because they're into the
alternative world and health

00:18:12.390 --> 00:18:13.190 align:middle line:90%
wise.

00:18:13.190 --> 00:18:14.290 align:middle line:90%
Said, what's this technology?

00:18:14.290 --> 00:18:15.255 align:middle line:90%
We want to learn more.

00:18:15.255 --> 00:18:16.630 align:middle line:84%
And I said, well,
I have no idea.

00:18:16.630 --> 00:18:17.430 align:middle line:90%
Connect with Scott.

00:18:17.430 --> 00:18:19.850 align:middle line:84%
I'll give you his number
and speak to the inventor.

00:18:19.850 --> 00:18:20.650 align:middle line:90%
They did.

00:18:20.650 --> 00:18:22.483 align:middle line:84%
They connected with Dr.
Sandra Rose Michael.

00:18:22.483 --> 00:18:25.950 align:middle line:84%
And they decided to send my
aunt to one of the only systems

00:18:25.950 --> 00:18:27.730 align:middle line:84%
out there, which
was a public center.

00:18:27.730 --> 00:18:31.650 align:middle line:84%
There were 19 public centers
back in April of 2022,

00:18:31.650 --> 00:18:33.130 align:middle line:90%
just a year and a half ago.

00:18:33.130 --> 00:18:35.640 align:middle line:84%
And the closest one to
our house in New York

00:18:35.640 --> 00:18:37.270 align:middle line:90%
was in Verona, New Jersey.

00:18:37.270 --> 00:18:40.810 align:middle line:84%
We sent her to a big 24-unit
system, much bigger than this.

00:18:40.810 --> 00:18:44.490 align:middle line:84%
And in four hours, she
was back to herself.

00:18:44.490 --> 00:18:47.200 align:middle line:84%
We're looking, what the
hell just happened there?

00:18:47.200 --> 00:18:49.830 align:middle line:84%
Now I'm inherently
a skeptical person.

00:18:49.830 --> 00:18:51.810 align:middle line:84%
So my first thing that
ran through my mind

00:18:51.810 --> 00:18:54.700 align:middle line:84%
was, it's got to be placebo
or the power of thought.

00:18:54.700 --> 00:18:58.020 align:middle line:84%
I still am not convinced that
there is an objective power

00:18:58.020 --> 00:18:59.350 align:middle line:90%
to this technology.

00:18:59.350 --> 00:19:03.650 align:middle line:84%
Same day, my sister's dog has a
4-centimeter tumor in his neck

00:19:03.650 --> 00:19:04.450 align:middle line:90%
that we found.

00:19:04.450 --> 00:19:06.040 align:middle line:90%
We said, send him to the system.

00:19:06.040 --> 00:19:08.250 align:middle line:84%
We send him to the
system with my aunt,

00:19:08.250 --> 00:19:09.700 align:middle line:90%
sleep there for three nights.

00:19:09.700 --> 00:19:11.610 align:middle line:84%
Three nights later,
the dog no longer

00:19:11.610 --> 00:19:13.170 align:middle line:90%
has the tumor in his neck.

00:19:13.170 --> 00:19:15.718 align:middle line:84%
That's where the placebo and
the power of thought, they were

00:19:15.718 --> 00:19:17.010 align:middle line:90%
completely went to the garbage.

00:19:17.010 --> 00:19:18.790 align:middle line:84%
Because it's a dog,
and it's not a human.

00:19:18.790 --> 00:19:19.960 align:middle line:90%
It works differently.

00:19:19.960 --> 00:19:22.210 align:middle line:84%
So now I put my hands
up, and I was intrigued.

00:19:22.210 --> 00:19:23.010 align:middle line:90%
I was interested.

00:19:23.010 --> 00:19:25.052 align:middle line:84%
And I didn't really
understand what was going on,

00:19:25.052 --> 00:19:26.740 align:middle line:84%
but I wanted to speak
to the inventor.

00:19:26.740 --> 00:19:28.617 align:middle line:84%
I got on a call with
Dr. Sandra Rose Michael.

00:19:28.617 --> 00:19:31.200 align:middle line:10%
Never heard about her before,
never experienced the technology

00:19:31.200 --> 00:19:32.490 align:middle line:10%
myself at that point.

00:19:32.490 --> 00:19:33.820 align:middle line:90%
I got on a call with her.

00:19:33.820 --> 00:19:35.370 align:middle line:90%
We're talking, talking, talking.

00:19:35.370 --> 00:19:38.710 align:middle line:84%
On the call, she goes, by the
way, I work with your people.

00:19:38.710 --> 00:19:40.290 align:middle line:90%
They approached me back in 2011.

00:19:40.290 --> 00:19:42.930 align:middle line:84%
In July of 2011,
TLS approached me.

00:19:42.930 --> 00:19:44.980 align:middle line:90%
And I'm like, what?

00:19:44.980 --> 00:19:47.610 align:middle line:84%
You're not even allowed to
tell me that if that's true.

00:19:47.610 --> 00:19:50.438 align:middle line:84%
So there was this weird
thing going on within me

00:19:50.438 --> 00:19:51.730 align:middle line:90%
because I'm like, is she lying?

00:19:51.730 --> 00:19:53.200 align:middle line:84%
I don't really know
who this woman is.

00:19:53.200 --> 00:19:54.510 align:middle line:84%
Let me make a phone
call, because I

00:19:54.510 --> 00:19:57.010 align:middle line:84%
felt that there was something
going on there that was bigger

00:19:57.010 --> 00:19:58.840 align:middle line:90%
than just a simple phone call.

00:19:58.840 --> 00:20:00.120 align:middle line:90%
So I call Ray.

00:20:00.120 --> 00:20:01.620 align:middle line:84%
And I say, hey, do
you know anything

00:20:01.620 --> 00:20:02.745 align:middle line:90%
about what's going on here?

00:20:02.745 --> 00:20:03.960 align:middle line:90%
And he starts laughing at me.

00:20:03.960 --> 00:20:05.360 align:middle line:90%
And he said, just keep going.

00:20:05.360 --> 00:20:06.610 align:middle line:90%
You're in the right direction.

00:20:06.610 --> 00:20:07.300 align:middle line:90%
I'm like, what do you mean?

00:20:07.300 --> 00:20:08.530 align:middle line:90%
I don't know what that means.

00:20:08.530 --> 00:20:09.820 align:middle line:90%
And he said, just keep going.

00:20:09.820 --> 00:20:11.670 align:middle line:90%
You got to go interview her.

00:20:11.670 --> 00:20:13.810 align:middle line:90%
And I said.

00:20:13.810 --> 00:20:15.520 align:middle line:90%
OK, why?

00:20:15.520 --> 00:20:17.050 align:middle line:90%
I just moved to Miami.

00:20:17.050 --> 00:20:18.587 align:middle line:90%
I was 25.

00:20:18.587 --> 00:20:19.420 align:middle line:90%
I just moved to my--

00:20:19.420 --> 00:20:20.350 align:middle line:90%
24.

00:20:20.350 --> 00:20:21.340 align:middle line:90%
I just moved to Miami.

00:20:21.340 --> 00:20:23.465 align:middle line:84%
And I'm like, listen, I
want to relax for a second.

00:20:23.465 --> 00:20:24.477 align:middle line:90%
I want to relax.

00:20:24.477 --> 00:20:26.060 align:middle line:84%
I don't want to go
to Vegas right now.

00:20:26.060 --> 00:20:27.272 align:middle line:90%
I'll do it over Zoom.

00:20:27.272 --> 00:20:28.730 align:middle line:84%
Then the organization
got involved.

00:20:28.730 --> 00:20:30.563 align:middle line:84%
They're like, you're
not doing it over Zoom.

00:20:30.563 --> 00:20:32.390 align:middle line:84%
You're going to go
interview this doctor.

00:20:32.390 --> 00:20:35.687 align:middle line:84%
And basically, back and
forth, I kept saying no.

00:20:35.687 --> 00:20:37.270 align:middle line:84%
And it got to a point
where they said,

00:20:37.270 --> 00:20:39.310 align:middle line:84%
listen, you're
getting on a plane,

00:20:39.310 --> 00:20:40.672 align:middle line:90%
we're putting you on a plane.

00:20:40.672 --> 00:20:42.880 align:middle line:84%
They put me over here in
the Wynn Hotel or the Encore

00:20:42.880 --> 00:20:44.120 align:middle line:90%
or whatever it was.

00:20:44.120 --> 00:20:45.740 align:middle line:84%
They said, go
interview the doctor.

00:20:45.740 --> 00:20:48.320 align:middle line:84%
And I said, under one condition,
I'd bring my father with me.

00:20:48.320 --> 00:20:49.820 align:middle line:84%
We're going to do
a father-son trip.

00:20:49.820 --> 00:20:51.980 align:middle line:84%
So I used them to
pay for a trip.

00:20:51.980 --> 00:20:53.180 align:middle line:90%
And I said, let's go, guys.

00:20:53.180 --> 00:20:53.930 align:middle line:90%
Let's have a good time.

00:20:53.930 --> 00:20:54.590 align:middle line:90%
I'll do the interview.

00:20:54.590 --> 00:20:55.573 align:middle line:90%
Just leave me alone.

00:20:55.573 --> 00:20:56.990 align:middle line:84%
So we made a whole
trip out of it.

00:20:56.990 --> 00:20:57.970 align:middle line:90%
We had a great time.

00:20:57.970 --> 00:21:00.633 align:middle line:10%
And I interviewed Dr.
Sandra Rose Michael myself.

00:21:00.633 --> 00:21:02.300 align:middle line:84%
I didn't have a
production team with me.

00:21:02.300 --> 00:21:03.800 align:middle line:84%
I brought my cameras
in my backpack,

00:21:03.800 --> 00:21:06.400 align:middle line:84%
sat down with her for an
hour, did the interview.

00:21:06.400 --> 00:21:07.458 align:middle line:90%
And I said, listen--

00:21:07.458 --> 00:21:08.500 align:middle line:90%
I told her whole family--

00:21:08.500 --> 00:21:10.570 align:middle line:84%
I'm like, listen, I know
you guys don't know me,

00:21:10.570 --> 00:21:11.620 align:middle line:90%
and I don't know you.

00:21:11.620 --> 00:21:13.717 align:middle line:84%
But the organization's
behind this.

00:21:13.717 --> 00:21:15.300 align:middle line:84%
And if the organization's
behind this,

00:21:15.300 --> 00:21:16.800 align:middle line:84%
it's going to be
bigger than we expect.

00:21:16.800 --> 00:21:18.380 align:middle line:84%
I don't know what's
about to happen,

00:21:18.380 --> 00:21:21.090 align:middle line:84%
but I need you to prepare
for what's about to happen.

00:21:21.090 --> 00:21:23.780 align:middle line:84%
And her son, Michael, who
is the CEO of the company,

00:21:23.780 --> 00:21:25.170 align:middle line:90%
he's like, OK, whatever you say.

00:21:25.170 --> 00:21:28.880 align:middle line:84%
I'm like, you might want to hire
somebody, like extra people.

00:21:28.880 --> 00:21:30.600 align:middle line:84%
He's like, OK, OK,
whatever you say.

00:21:30.600 --> 00:21:31.670 align:middle line:90%
So I put the--

00:21:31.670 --> 00:21:33.620 align:middle line:90%
I did the interview on May 22nd.

00:21:33.620 --> 00:21:36.210 align:middle line:10%
May 27th, it comes
out, five days later.

00:21:36.210 --> 00:21:39.500 align:middle line:84%
This was a Friday, 12:00
PM Eastern Time, May 27th.

00:21:39.500 --> 00:21:41.000 align:middle line:90%
Comes out.

00:21:41.000 --> 00:21:42.680 align:middle line:84%
I still don't know
what happened,

00:21:42.680 --> 00:21:44.700 align:middle line:84%
but this is the power
of the organization.

00:21:44.700 --> 00:21:49.260 align:middle line:84%
I want to show you guys how
obvious their interference is

00:21:49.260 --> 00:21:51.510 align:middle line:84%
because there's no other way
this could have happened.

00:21:51.510 --> 00:21:53.060 align:middle line:90%
The interview comes out.

00:21:53.060 --> 00:21:57.320 align:middle line:84%
The next day, within 24 hours,
they receive 70,000 emails from

00:21:57.320 --> 00:21:58.620 align:middle line:90%
people all around the world.

00:21:58.620 --> 00:22:00.540 align:middle line:90%
They gave me a task.

00:22:00.540 --> 00:22:02.960 align:middle line:84%
They said, you've got to
go interview this doctor.

00:22:02.960 --> 00:22:05.820 align:middle line:84%
Three-pronged approach,
three-pronged task--

00:22:05.820 --> 00:22:07.632 align:middle line:84%
make people aware
of this technology,

00:22:07.632 --> 00:22:10.340 align:middle line:84%
make it more affordable, make it
more accessible because it's not

00:22:10.340 --> 00:22:11.140 align:middle line:90%
cheap.

00:22:11.140 --> 00:22:13.220 align:middle line:84%
90% of the technology
being sold was

00:22:13.220 --> 00:22:15.610 align:middle line:84%
being sold to very rich
people because those were

00:22:15.610 --> 00:22:16.860 align:middle line:90%
the ones that could afford it.

00:22:16.860 --> 00:22:19.430 align:middle line:90%
Only 10% were public centers.

00:22:19.430 --> 00:22:22.820 align:middle line:84%
They wanted me to shift
that ratio to make it 90/10

00:22:22.820 --> 00:22:23.783 align:middle line:90%
public/private.

00:22:23.783 --> 00:22:25.700 align:middle line:10%
I said, I don't know how
I'm going to do that,

00:22:25.700 --> 00:22:28.010 align:middle line:10%
but I'll follow what
you guys are asking out

00:22:28.010 --> 00:22:29.120 align:middle line:10%
of respect to you guys.

00:22:29.120 --> 00:22:32.930 align:middle line:10%
In the interview, all I
said was, to the viewers,

00:22:32.930 --> 00:22:35.750 align:middle line:10%
if this resonates
with you, if you

00:22:35.750 --> 00:22:38.390 align:middle line:10%
want to help fulfill what
we're trying to do here,

00:22:38.390 --> 00:22:40.620 align:middle line:10%
don't just buy the
technology for yourself.

00:22:40.620 --> 00:22:41.960 align:middle line:90%
Open a center.

00:22:41.960 --> 00:22:43.910 align:middle line:84%
Open a center somewhere
around the world

00:22:43.910 --> 00:22:45.952 align:middle line:84%
and make this
affordable for people

00:22:45.952 --> 00:22:47.660 align:middle line:84%
all around the world
instead of buying it

00:22:47.660 --> 00:22:48.743 align:middle line:90%
for your own private home.

00:22:48.743 --> 00:22:52.370 align:middle line:84%
That way, you can use it, and
other people can use it as well.

00:22:52.370 --> 00:22:55.220 align:middle line:84%
That 10 or 20-second portion
of the hour and five minute

00:22:55.220 --> 00:22:58.790 align:middle line:84%
interview is what caused
70,000 people to email EESystem

00:22:58.790 --> 00:23:01.290 align:middle line:90%
and say, we're in, we're ready.

00:23:01.290 --> 00:23:02.662 align:middle line:90%
Michael started freaking out.

00:23:02.662 --> 00:23:04.620 align:middle line:84%
He's like, Jason, I don't
know what's going on.

00:23:04.620 --> 00:23:07.245 align:middle line:84%
I told him-- I'm like, Michael,
I have no idea what's going on.

00:23:07.245 --> 00:23:08.280 align:middle line:90%
But they were involved.

00:23:08.280 --> 00:23:10.760 align:middle line:84%
There was no other way that
this is going to happen.

00:23:10.760 --> 00:23:15.080 align:middle line:84%
In June of 2022, a
few days later, three,

00:23:15.080 --> 00:23:18.020 align:middle line:84%
four days later, I created
something called UNIFYD Healing.

00:23:18.020 --> 00:23:20.922 align:middle line:84%
UNIFYD Healing was
an idea that came

00:23:20.922 --> 00:23:22.880 align:middle line:84%
from the place of there's
all these people that

00:23:22.880 --> 00:23:24.840 align:middle line:90%
want to open up these centers.

00:23:24.840 --> 00:23:27.260 align:middle line:84%
How are people going to
know that they exist?

00:23:27.260 --> 00:23:29.690 align:middle line:84%
So I created
overnight in 24 hours

00:23:29.690 --> 00:23:32.390 align:middle line:84%
UNIFYD Healing, which
I basically used

00:23:32.390 --> 00:23:34.200 align:middle line:90%
the user base of UNIFYD TV.

00:23:34.200 --> 00:23:36.590 align:middle line:84%
And I created this
platform to show them,

00:23:36.590 --> 00:23:39.260 align:middle line:84%
look at this technology and
all these new centers that

00:23:39.260 --> 00:23:42.110 align:middle line:84%
are going to be opening today
with the help, of course,

00:23:42.110 --> 00:23:43.410 align:middle line:90%
of the organization.

00:23:43.410 --> 00:23:46.010 align:middle line:84%
And thankfully, to
everybody that stepped up--

00:23:46.010 --> 00:23:47.900 align:middle line:84%
when I say with the help
of the organization,

00:23:47.900 --> 00:23:49.470 align:middle line:84%
they have never put
a dollar into this.

00:23:49.470 --> 00:23:50.720 align:middle line:84%
As a matter of fact,
I'm not allowed

00:23:50.720 --> 00:23:52.320 align:middle line:84%
to make a dollar
from this either.

00:23:52.320 --> 00:23:53.760 align:middle line:90%
That was a part of the deal.

00:23:53.760 --> 00:23:57.330 align:middle line:84%
The idea over here is we
create this organization--

00:23:57.330 --> 00:23:59.750 align:middle line:84%
it's a nonprofit
organization-- to bring more

00:23:59.750 --> 00:24:01.550 align:middle line:84%
awareness to these
centers around the world

00:24:01.550 --> 00:24:03.990 align:middle line:84%
and to use those funds
to continue the mission.

00:24:03.990 --> 00:24:06.290 align:middle line:84%
As a matter of fact, a
few people from our team,

00:24:06.290 --> 00:24:10.400 align:middle line:84%
including the manager of the
entire UNIFYD Healing team,

00:24:10.400 --> 00:24:11.490 align:middle line:90%
is here today.

00:24:11.490 --> 00:24:14.780 align:middle line:10%
And thanks to him and
his team, in a year

00:24:14.780 --> 00:24:16.670 align:middle line:10%
and a few months, today--

00:24:16.670 --> 00:24:17.470 align:middle line:10%
how many?

00:24:17.470 --> 00:24:20.250 align:middle line:90%
What's the number?

00:24:20.250 --> 00:24:24.620 align:middle line:84%
We've opened 363 centers in over
40 countries around the world.

00:24:24.620 --> 00:24:27.990 align:middle line:90%
[APPLAUSE]

00:24:27.990 --> 00:24:31.130 align:middle line:84%
So I say that because I
want you guys to understand

00:24:31.130 --> 00:24:31.930 align:middle line:90%
who's behind this.

00:24:31.930 --> 00:24:33.750 align:middle line:84%
I could not have
done this myself.

00:24:33.750 --> 00:24:36.290 align:middle line:84%
Ben and Lily could not
have done that themselves.

00:24:36.290 --> 00:24:39.960 align:middle line:84%
We, obviously, put a lot
of work and a lot of hours,

00:24:39.960 --> 00:24:42.550 align:middle line:84%
and we work our butts
off to make this happen.

00:24:42.550 --> 00:24:44.430 align:middle line:84%
But there was a
force and a power

00:24:44.430 --> 00:24:47.520 align:middle line:84%
behind this that made it
happen because I was not

00:24:47.520 --> 00:24:51.140 align:middle line:84%
the first person to interview
Dr. Sandra Rose Michael.

00:24:51.140 --> 00:24:52.620 align:middle line:90%
And I wasn't the last either.

00:24:52.620 --> 00:24:54.000 align:middle line:90%
So what was the difference?

00:24:54.000 --> 00:24:56.330 align:middle line:84%
The difference was there
were people behind this

00:24:56.330 --> 00:24:57.310 align:middle line:90%
to put it out.

00:24:57.310 --> 00:24:59.090 align:middle line:84%
People were ready
to hear the message.

00:24:59.090 --> 00:25:01.460 align:middle line:84%
And people were
ready to take action

00:25:01.460 --> 00:25:04.670 align:middle line:84%
to open 363 centers
in a year and a half

00:25:04.670 --> 00:25:06.740 align:middle line:84%
with 500 on a
wait-list because we

00:25:06.740 --> 00:25:10.100 align:middle line:84%
couldn't open others too close
to each other is something

00:25:10.100 --> 00:25:11.980 align:middle line:84%
that McDonald's didn't
do when they opened.

00:25:11.980 --> 00:25:14.410 align:middle line:84%
It's something that Starbucks
didn't do when they opened.

00:25:14.410 --> 00:25:17.480 align:middle line:84%
So what I always
say is very simple.

00:25:17.480 --> 00:25:20.060 align:middle line:84%
Number one, this is the energy
enhancement system cube.

00:25:20.060 --> 00:25:21.210 align:middle line:84%
And this is what
I'm talking about.

00:25:21.210 --> 00:25:22.710 align:middle line:84%
And unfortunately,
I don't have time

00:25:22.710 --> 00:25:24.740 align:middle line:84%
to dive into how this
whole thing works.

00:25:24.740 --> 00:25:28.640 align:middle line:84%
But it basically creates an
enhanced, energetic environment

00:25:28.640 --> 00:25:31.070 align:middle line:84%
to help your body do
what it does best,

00:25:31.070 --> 00:25:32.528 align:middle line:90%
and that's heal itself.

00:25:32.528 --> 00:25:34.070 align:middle line:84%
When you cut your
arm, you don't have

00:25:34.070 --> 00:25:35.670 align:middle line:84%
to think about it
healing itself.

00:25:35.670 --> 00:25:36.620 align:middle line:90%
You can go to sleep.

00:25:36.620 --> 00:25:37.765 align:middle line:90%
You can be in a coma.

00:25:37.765 --> 00:25:39.140 align:middle line:10%
You can be in a
business meeting.

00:25:39.140 --> 00:25:40.230 align:middle line:90%
You can be awake.

00:25:40.230 --> 00:25:42.440 align:middle line:84%
The body will
always do one thing.

00:25:42.440 --> 00:25:46.560 align:middle line:84%
And that is heal itself, bring
itself back into balance.

00:25:46.560 --> 00:25:48.437 align:middle line:84%
When I first saw
this thing, I didn't

00:25:48.437 --> 00:25:50.270 align:middle line:84%
understand what was
going on because it just

00:25:50.270 --> 00:25:52.600 align:middle line:84%
looks like screens and
lights and computers.

00:25:52.600 --> 00:25:54.040 align:middle line:90%
And that's why I was skeptical.

00:25:54.040 --> 00:25:56.850 align:middle line:84%
And again, I don't have time to
go into the science behind it,

00:25:56.850 --> 00:25:58.440 align:middle line:84%
but there are
different interviews

00:25:58.440 --> 00:26:00.750 align:middle line:84%
that you guys can watch to
explain the science so you

00:26:00.750 --> 00:26:03.780 align:middle line:84%
understand it for yourself
in a very grounded way.

00:26:03.780 --> 00:26:06.210 align:middle line:84%
What I want to leave you
all off with over here

00:26:06.210 --> 00:26:09.100 align:middle line:84%
is to never look outside
of yourself for an answer.

00:26:09.100 --> 00:26:11.220 align:middle line:10%
There can be organizations
and awesome people

00:26:11.220 --> 00:26:12.460 align:middle line:10%
doing awesome things.

00:26:12.460 --> 00:26:13.750 align:middle line:90%
They're not your saviors.

00:26:13.750 --> 00:26:15.100 align:middle line:90%
They're not your heroes.

00:26:15.100 --> 00:26:17.540 align:middle line:84%
They're not somebody that's
going to come and save you.

00:26:17.540 --> 00:26:18.340 align:middle line:90%
They can help you.

00:26:18.340 --> 00:26:19.390 align:middle line:90%
They can guide you.

00:26:19.390 --> 00:26:21.840 align:middle line:84%
The key is to return
back into your own power.

00:26:21.840 --> 00:26:24.660 align:middle line:10%
It's defined what universal
awareness actually

00:26:24.660 --> 00:26:26.520 align:middle line:10%
looks like within
yourself and help

00:26:26.520 --> 00:26:28.950 align:middle line:10%
radiate that newfound awareness
and energy to everybody

00:26:28.950 --> 00:26:29.750 align:middle line:10%
around you.

00:26:29.750 --> 00:26:31.950 align:middle line:84%
And that's why I always
say, only we can save us,

00:26:31.950 --> 00:26:33.400 align:middle line:90%
and only you can save you.

00:26:33.400 --> 00:26:35.620 align:middle line:84%
I want to say thank you guys
very much for your time.

00:26:35.620 --> 00:26:37.800 align:middle line:84%
Thank you for having
me, and I look forward

00:26:37.800 --> 00:26:39.370 align:middle line:84%
to seeing you guys
at future events.

00:26:39.370 --> 00:26:40.170 align:middle line:90%
Thank

00:26:40.170 --> 00:26:41.310 align:middle line:90%
