00:00:04.930 --> 00:00:08.381 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:08.381 --> 00:00:12.340 align:middle line:90%


00:00:12.340 --> 00:00:13.930 align:middle line:90%
>> Hey, everyone.

00:00:13.930 --> 00:00:16.470 align:middle line:90%
Is my mic working?

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:17.730 align:middle line:90%
Can you hear me?

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:18.950 align:middle line:90%
Can you see me?

00:00:18.950 --> 00:00:20.790 align:middle line:90%
OK, cool.

00:00:20.790 --> 00:00:22.650 align:middle line:90%
I don't know.

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:25.970 align:middle line:84%
Did you guys go to
the Area 51 yesterday?

00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:26.770 align:middle line:90%
Who went?

00:00:26.770 --> 00:00:28.590 align:middle line:10%
Did you see stuff?

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:29.400 align:middle line:10%
No?

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:31.710 align:middle line:10%
[LAUGHTER]

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:34.170 align:middle line:10%
That's why?

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:38.560 align:middle line:10%
I thought some of you got
abducted or something.

00:00:38.560 --> 00:00:42.400 align:middle line:84%
So we're going to talk
about telepathy downloads.

00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:43.200 align:middle line:90%
Why?

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:47.460 align:middle line:10%
Because this is something
that we do naturally

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:49.980 align:middle line:10%
but also because
we are interacting

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:52.450 align:middle line:10%
with nonvisible
entities all the time.

00:00:52.450 --> 00:00:53.830 align:middle line:90%
We're going to talk about that.

00:00:53.830 --> 00:01:01.590 align:middle line:84%
But before we begin, I put
this barcode thing in case

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:04.660 align:middle line:84%
you have more questions
and we run out of time.

00:01:04.660 --> 00:01:06.640 align:middle line:90%
I always forget to do that.

00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:11.520 align:middle line:10%
So this takes you to my
website and YouTube channel

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:16.250 align:middle line:10%
and everything else so that
you can continue the work.

00:01:16.250 --> 00:01:22.210 align:middle line:10%
So I'm going to start by talking
about my background because it

00:01:22.210 --> 00:01:28.870 align:middle line:10%
is how I got here and the
subject of today's conversation.

00:01:28.870 --> 00:01:31.660 align:middle line:84%
We're going to talk
about telepathy downloads

00:01:31.660 --> 00:01:35.770 align:middle line:84%
and actually different
types of contact experiences

00:01:35.770 --> 00:01:38.440 align:middle line:90%
because what is contact?

00:01:38.440 --> 00:01:42.160 align:middle line:84%
It's actually coming
together-- coming in contact

00:01:42.160 --> 00:01:45.080 align:middle line:84%
with an invisible
or nonhuman entity.

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:48.320 align:middle line:84%
And then information
starts to get transferred.

00:01:48.320 --> 00:01:50.030 align:middle line:90%
So that is a form of telepathy.

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:51.430 align:middle line:90%
We're going to talk about that.

00:01:51.430 --> 00:01:55.460 align:middle line:10%
And my favorite
subject is the matrix.

00:01:55.460 --> 00:02:01.390 align:middle line:10%
I mean, it's like I like
to explain how things work.

00:02:01.390 --> 00:02:03.680 align:middle line:84%
It's not like, don't tell
me you're telepathic.

00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:05.470 align:middle line:90%
I want to know how--

00:02:05.470 --> 00:02:08.419 align:middle line:84%
how I'm telepathic,
how it's possible.

00:02:08.419 --> 00:02:15.550 align:middle line:10%
And so I ended up, figuring
out a lot of the framework

00:02:15.550 --> 00:02:18.490 align:middle line:10%
within which we exist
and we function.

00:02:18.490 --> 00:02:19.930 align:middle line:10%
And that is the matrix.

00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:21.230 align:middle line:10%
We're going to talk about that.

00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:26.480 align:middle line:10%
And then, of course, I would
love to do an actual exercise.

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:28.720 align:middle line:90%
Would you like that?

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:29.840 align:middle line:90%
Cool.

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:32.200 align:middle line:84%
So for those of you who
have a notepad, then

00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:34.520 align:middle line:84%
we can do some
automatic writing.

00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:39.530 align:middle line:84%
Otherwise, we can do a different
type of telepathic experiment.

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:40.820 align:middle line:90%
So we're going to do that.

00:02:40.820 --> 00:02:45.110 align:middle line:84%
And more importantly, how can
we use that in our daily life?

00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:48.790 align:middle line:84%
Because, obviously,
what's the point

00:02:48.790 --> 00:02:53.680 align:middle line:84%
of learning things and doing
things if we can't apply them

00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:54.950 align:middle line:90%
in our daily life?

00:02:54.950 --> 00:03:01.030 align:middle line:84%
So everything started for
me at the age of five.

00:03:01.030 --> 00:03:03.440 align:middle line:90%
So here's me at the age of five.

00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:06.460 align:middle line:90%
I was a lot cuter then.

00:03:06.460 --> 00:03:09.010 align:middle line:90%
But anyways, I was just there.

00:03:09.010 --> 00:03:15.650 align:middle line:84%
And all of a sudden, this
energy shows up in the room.

00:03:15.650 --> 00:03:18.670 align:middle line:90%
And so it felt like light.

00:03:18.670 --> 00:03:22.640 align:middle line:84%
It felt like the entire
room was flooded with light.

00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:26.680 align:middle line:84%
And I could sense that it
was beings because they

00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:28.990 align:middle line:90%
were communicating.

00:03:28.990 --> 00:03:31.630 align:middle line:90%
I saw some sort of an exchange.

00:03:31.630 --> 00:03:33.910 align:middle line:84%
And I realized that
I could see them.

00:03:33.910 --> 00:03:34.840 align:middle line:90%
I could hear them.

00:03:34.840 --> 00:03:36.290 align:middle line:90%
I could sense them.

00:03:36.290 --> 00:03:39.320 align:middle line:84%
And it was very
natural, actually.

00:03:39.320 --> 00:03:41.270 align:middle line:90%
It wasn't an effort at all.

00:03:41.270 --> 00:03:45.470 align:middle line:84%
And in fact, the
energy was so nice.

00:03:45.470 --> 00:03:48.080 align:middle line:90%
It was so loving and kind.

00:03:48.080 --> 00:03:51.500 align:middle line:84%
It was quite a contrast
with the humans in the room.

00:03:51.500 --> 00:03:55.130 align:middle line:10%
So that's why I was
paying attention.

00:03:55.130 --> 00:03:59.690 align:middle line:84%
And I realized that we were
literally merged together.

00:03:59.690 --> 00:04:01.520 align:middle line:90%
It was like I was them.

00:04:01.520 --> 00:04:02.560 align:middle line:90%
They were me.

00:04:02.560 --> 00:04:05.510 align:middle line:84%
And I could see a
lot of geometry.

00:04:05.510 --> 00:04:10.430 align:middle line:84%
It was just like there was codes
and geometry in this space.

00:04:10.430 --> 00:04:13.220 align:middle line:84%
And so, of course,
I'm five years old.

00:04:13.220 --> 00:04:16.070 align:middle line:84%
I don't really understand
what's going on.

00:04:16.070 --> 00:04:17.620 align:middle line:90%
I just know that it feels good.

00:04:17.620 --> 00:04:18.940 align:middle line:90%
It feels familiar.

00:04:18.940 --> 00:04:20.810 align:middle line:90%
So I just go with it.

00:04:20.810 --> 00:04:25.090 align:middle line:84%
And then I realized that they
were actually transferring

00:04:25.090 --> 00:04:28.010 align:middle line:90%
information into my being.

00:04:28.010 --> 00:04:30.190 align:middle line:84%
And what I mean
by information, it

00:04:30.190 --> 00:04:34.390 align:middle line:84%
was like, for example,
they would tell me,

00:04:34.390 --> 00:04:35.380 align:middle line:90%
this is who we are.

00:04:35.380 --> 00:04:36.490 align:middle line:90%
This is who you are.

00:04:36.490 --> 00:04:39.500 align:middle line:84%
And this is how
we are connecting.

00:04:39.500 --> 00:04:41.740 align:middle line:84%
And we're going to be together
the rest of your life,

00:04:41.740 --> 00:04:44.180 align:middle line:90%
the whole conversation.

00:04:44.180 --> 00:04:46.700 align:middle line:84%
But it would be in
the form of a code.

00:04:46.700 --> 00:04:49.480 align:middle line:84%
It would be like a
one little thing,

00:04:49.480 --> 00:04:56.360 align:middle line:84%
a particle of energy of some
kind that looked like geometry.

00:04:56.360 --> 00:04:58.600 align:middle line:84%
And it would come
into my consciousness.

00:04:58.600 --> 00:05:01.540 align:middle line:84%
And I would understand
this whole thing

00:05:01.540 --> 00:05:03.050 align:middle line:90%
they were talking about.

00:05:03.050 --> 00:05:08.350 align:middle line:10%
And so what I mean is that they
were telling me a whole chapter.

00:05:08.350 --> 00:05:12.560 align:middle line:84%
But I was only receiving
one tiny little code thing.

00:05:12.560 --> 00:05:13.610 align:middle line:90%
Isn't that cool?

00:05:13.610 --> 00:05:17.050 align:middle line:84%
And so again, I'm
five years old.

00:05:17.050 --> 00:05:22.020 align:middle line:84%
And so they said, this is how
you communicate telepathically.

00:05:22.020 --> 00:05:29.950 align:middle line:84%
And so notice how your brain
is picking up the information.

00:05:29.950 --> 00:05:34.470 align:middle line:84%
And so I was seeing these
little things literally

00:05:34.470 --> 00:05:36.060 align:middle line:90%
like a zip drive.

00:05:36.060 --> 00:05:39.910 align:middle line:84%
So it was like-- because it
contained a lot of information.

00:05:39.910 --> 00:05:44.280 align:middle line:84%
And then when it came into my
consciousness, it would unzip.

00:05:44.280 --> 00:05:46.120 align:middle line:84%
And I would
understand everything.

00:05:46.120 --> 00:05:48.160 align:middle line:90%
And so they said, pay attention.

00:05:48.160 --> 00:05:50.880 align:middle line:84%
What is your brain
doing right now

00:05:50.880 --> 00:05:53.620 align:middle line:84%
that it can understand
this information?

00:05:53.620 --> 00:05:55.560 align:middle line:84%
And of course, I'm
five years old.

00:05:55.560 --> 00:05:59.040 align:middle line:84%
So I'm like, what
is my brain doing?

00:05:59.040 --> 00:06:01.830 align:middle line:84%
And so they said,
in order for you

00:06:01.830 --> 00:06:06.780 align:middle line:84%
to keep that up the rest of
your life, you have to ask.

00:06:06.780 --> 00:06:07.690 align:middle line:90%
You have to ask.

00:06:07.690 --> 00:06:10.830 align:middle line:84%
So basically, they
were asking me.

00:06:10.830 --> 00:06:13.260 align:middle line:84%
They were teaching
me or reminding me

00:06:13.260 --> 00:06:18.310 align:middle line:84%
how to focus and intend
because they were saying things

00:06:18.310 --> 00:06:19.720 align:middle line:90%
don't just happen.

00:06:19.720 --> 00:06:21.430 align:middle line:90%
You make them happen.

00:06:21.430 --> 00:06:22.840 align:middle line:90%
You create.

00:06:22.840 --> 00:06:25.010 align:middle line:84%
And you intend for
things to happen.

00:06:25.010 --> 00:06:26.390 align:middle line:90%
So that was the big lesson.

00:06:26.390 --> 00:06:31.430 align:middle line:84%
So basically, I realized that I
was more than my physical body.

00:06:31.430 --> 00:06:36.850 align:middle line:84%
I was in this container
on this side of the veil.

00:06:36.850 --> 00:06:38.540 align:middle line:90%
But they were my--

00:06:38.540 --> 00:06:41.440 align:middle line:84%
they were like my
stream of consciousness

00:06:41.440 --> 00:06:46.340 align:middle line:84%
from where I had
surfaced or emerged.

00:06:46.340 --> 00:06:50.540 align:middle line:84%
And so we were like
the same energy.

00:06:50.540 --> 00:06:51.830 align:middle line:90%
It was super cool.

00:06:51.830 --> 00:06:53.360 align:middle line:90%
It was something like this.

00:06:53.360 --> 00:06:58.670 align:middle line:84%
And I could see that I had a
human DNA, sort of a human body.

00:06:58.670 --> 00:07:02.840 align:middle line:84%
But then I continued on and
on and on and on and on.

00:07:02.840 --> 00:07:07.490 align:middle line:84%
And so that experience
stayed in my consciousness,

00:07:07.490 --> 00:07:09.320 align:middle line:84%
obviously, since
the age of five.

00:07:09.320 --> 00:07:10.670 align:middle line:90%
That's a very long time.

00:07:10.670 --> 00:07:11.990 align:middle line:90%
That's about 20 years.

00:07:11.990 --> 00:07:15.138 align:middle line:84%
So what happened was, after
that, people asked me,

00:07:15.138 --> 00:07:16.430 align:middle line:90%
what did you tell your parents?

00:07:16.430 --> 00:07:17.513 align:middle line:90%
Did you tell your parents?

00:07:17.513 --> 00:07:21.790 align:middle line:84%
And I didn't tell my
parents because I thought,

00:07:21.790 --> 00:07:22.930 align:middle line:90%
everybody did that.

00:07:22.930 --> 00:07:24.350 align:middle line:90%
All the children did that.

00:07:24.350 --> 00:07:29.740 align:middle line:84%
And I didn't want to
embarrass myself and say,

00:07:29.740 --> 00:07:31.220 align:middle line:90%
I had this experience.

00:07:31.220 --> 00:07:32.540 align:middle line:90%
I didn't think it was special.

00:07:32.540 --> 00:07:34.250 align:middle line:90%
I didn't think I was special.

00:07:34.250 --> 00:07:37.810 align:middle line:84%
And so because of that,
I didn't say anything,

00:07:37.810 --> 00:07:41.740 align:middle line:84%
which was a good thing because
probably they would have said,

00:07:41.740 --> 00:07:43.365 align:middle line:90%
stop talking to nobody.

00:07:43.365 --> 00:07:46.180 align:middle line:90%


00:07:46.180 --> 00:07:48.970 align:middle line:84%
So what happened,
though, as I grew up,

00:07:48.970 --> 00:07:50.890 align:middle line:90%
I realized, wait a minute.

00:07:50.890 --> 00:07:55.510 align:middle line:90%
It's not as common as I thought.

00:07:55.510 --> 00:07:59.210 align:middle line:84%
I was, maybe there is something
interesting or strange going on.

00:07:59.210 --> 00:08:01.810 align:middle line:84%
So I started asking
the questions.

00:08:01.810 --> 00:08:02.930 align:middle line:90%
How did it happen?

00:08:02.930 --> 00:08:03.730 align:middle line:90%
How?

00:08:03.730 --> 00:08:07.780 align:middle line:84%
How is it possible
that stuff gets

00:08:07.780 --> 00:08:12.830 align:middle line:84%
moved, transferred from one
something into me and back

00:08:12.830 --> 00:08:13.630 align:middle line:90%
and forth?

00:08:13.630 --> 00:08:15.920 align:middle line:84%
Because they could also
hear me, obviously.

00:08:15.920 --> 00:08:18.160 align:middle line:84%
And so I realized
that there's got

00:08:18.160 --> 00:08:22.690 align:middle line:84%
to be a mechanism
but also a medium,

00:08:22.690 --> 00:08:27.790 align:middle line:84%
something that we exist in
that allows this interaction

00:08:27.790 --> 00:08:28.790 align:middle line:90%
to happen.

00:08:28.790 --> 00:08:31.070 align:middle line:84%
And I realized that
I could see it.

00:08:31.070 --> 00:08:35.969 align:middle line:84%
I could literally see the
space between you and me.

00:08:35.969 --> 00:08:37.664 align:middle line:84%
And it looks
something like this.

00:08:37.664 --> 00:08:39.500 align:middle line:10%
Isn't that interesting?

00:08:39.500 --> 00:08:42.200 align:middle line:10%
That is the matrix.

00:08:42.200 --> 00:08:43.309 align:middle line:10%
But what is it?

00:08:43.309 --> 00:08:46.490 align:middle line:10%
Actually, literally,
it's the patterning

00:08:46.490 --> 00:08:50.420 align:middle line:10%
of the fabric of space-time.

00:08:50.420 --> 00:08:52.660 align:middle line:84%
Obviously, we think
space is empty.

00:08:52.660 --> 00:08:55.640 align:middle line:84%
We know scientists told
us it is not empty.

00:08:55.640 --> 00:08:56.750 align:middle line:90%
But what is it?

00:08:56.750 --> 00:08:57.890 align:middle line:90%
What is it made of?

00:08:57.890 --> 00:08:59.730 align:middle line:90%
And how is it organized?

00:08:59.730 --> 00:09:04.070 align:middle line:84%
So these geometric
patterns that I was seeing

00:09:04.070 --> 00:09:09.800 align:middle line:84%
were also contained
within a larger geometric

00:09:09.800 --> 00:09:12.650 align:middle line:90%
patterning of space itself.

00:09:12.650 --> 00:09:14.220 align:middle line:90%
Just think about that.

00:09:14.220 --> 00:09:19.490 align:middle line:84%
And so, of course, I have
a whole class on this.

00:09:19.490 --> 00:09:22.880 align:middle line:84%
And I explain the
geometry and how it works

00:09:22.880 --> 00:09:24.030 align:middle line:90%
and how it came about.

00:09:24.030 --> 00:09:26.810 align:middle line:84%
But right now, for the sake of--
because we really want to become

00:09:26.810 --> 00:09:30.440 align:middle line:84%
telepathic within an hour
or so, I'm going to--

00:09:30.440 --> 00:09:32.940 align:middle line:84%
so I'm going to
skip and keep going.

00:09:32.940 --> 00:09:36.410 align:middle line:84%
But I want to show
you the visuals.

00:09:36.410 --> 00:09:39.230 align:middle line:84%
There's a lot of mathematics
and a lot of work

00:09:39.230 --> 00:09:40.530 align:middle line:90%
that went into this.

00:09:40.530 --> 00:09:42.770 align:middle line:10%
But for the sake
of today, I just

00:09:42.770 --> 00:09:45.200 align:middle line:10%
want to show you
the visuals for you

00:09:45.200 --> 00:09:52.310 align:middle line:10%
to sense that we are inside
this network of information,

00:09:52.310 --> 00:09:54.780 align:middle line:10%
this network of geometry.

00:09:54.780 --> 00:10:03.050 align:middle line:10%
And so the more I was able to
see it, I want to eventually--

00:10:03.050 --> 00:10:06.590 align:middle line:10%
I'm talking years and years of
work and research and everything

00:10:06.590 --> 00:10:07.670 align:middle line:10%
else--

00:10:07.670 --> 00:10:10.850 align:middle line:10%
I was able to figure out
the entire algorithm.

00:10:10.850 --> 00:10:12.580 align:middle line:90%
And I mapped it out.

00:10:12.580 --> 00:10:22.740 align:middle line:84%
In fact, I created a script,
meaning a code, software,

00:10:22.740 --> 00:10:26.550 align:middle line:84%
that allows us to see, depending
on where we are right now.

00:10:26.550 --> 00:10:28.300 align:middle line:90%
We're in Vegas, I think.

00:10:28.300 --> 00:10:32.640 align:middle line:84%
And so it's like you
look at this matrix.

00:10:32.640 --> 00:10:34.920 align:middle line:84%
And then you are
able to see where

00:10:34.920 --> 00:10:37.320 align:middle line:84%
you are within this
geometry, which

00:10:37.320 --> 00:10:41.390 align:middle line:84%
is very important because,
as I looked carefully,

00:10:41.390 --> 00:10:47.090 align:middle line:84%
I saw that it was actually three
grids, three networks, three

00:10:47.090 --> 00:10:49.740 align:middle line:84%
geometric patterns
within each other.

00:10:49.740 --> 00:10:52.430 align:middle line:84%
And because its geometry,
for those of you

00:10:52.430 --> 00:10:56.390 align:middle line:84%
who know harmonics
and geometry, geometry

00:10:56.390 --> 00:11:00.720 align:middle line:84%
has patterns but also
has intersecting points.

00:11:00.720 --> 00:11:04.810 align:middle line:84%
These intersecting points
are called vertexes.

00:11:04.810 --> 00:11:08.360 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to call them nodes
from a scientific perspective.

00:11:08.360 --> 00:11:13.880 align:middle line:84%
I worked with a lot
of scientists on this.

00:11:13.880 --> 00:11:15.740 align:middle line:84%
Actually, there's
quite some evidence,

00:11:15.740 --> 00:11:17.390 align:middle line:90%
but nobody talks about this.

00:11:17.390 --> 00:11:19.370 align:middle line:84%
Nobody teaches us
any of this stuff

00:11:19.370 --> 00:11:21.060 align:middle line:90%
because it sounds so crazy.

00:11:21.060 --> 00:11:22.260 align:middle line:90%
And it is, kind of.

00:11:22.260 --> 00:11:26.480 align:middle line:84%
But actually, there is
quite a bit of evidence

00:11:26.480 --> 00:11:31.850 align:middle line:84%
that everything in
existence is geometric,

00:11:31.850 --> 00:11:34.080 align:middle line:90%
and it's patterned in this way.

00:11:34.080 --> 00:11:36.230 align:middle line:84%
So anyway, again, I'm
going to fast-forward

00:11:36.230 --> 00:11:39.730 align:middle line:84%
so that I can get to
the important part.

00:11:39.730 --> 00:11:44.490 align:middle line:84%
So as I started to realize
these vertexes, I was like,

00:11:44.490 --> 00:11:46.060 align:middle line:90%
what does that mean?

00:11:46.060 --> 00:11:52.890 align:middle line:84%
What happens when you look at
or when you are interacting

00:11:52.890 --> 00:11:55.210 align:middle line:90%
with a specific vertex point?

00:11:55.210 --> 00:11:57.190 align:middle line:90%
And this is where the fun began.

00:11:57.190 --> 00:12:00.390 align:middle line:84%
So I would concentrate
on one vertex point,

00:12:00.390 --> 00:12:03.600 align:middle line:90%
this intersection of lines.

00:12:03.600 --> 00:12:06.010 align:middle line:90%
And I would have an experience.

00:12:06.010 --> 00:12:10.260 align:middle line:84%
One point or certain
points would give me

00:12:10.260 --> 00:12:13.950 align:middle line:84%
the illusion, the
impression of space-time,

00:12:13.950 --> 00:12:17.610 align:middle line:84%
meaning I could see
that I was functioning

00:12:17.610 --> 00:12:20.410 align:middle line:90%
within linear space-time.

00:12:20.410 --> 00:12:23.730 align:middle line:84%
But when I went through
this vertex, when

00:12:23.730 --> 00:12:27.180 align:middle line:84%
I focused my consciousness
and I went exactly

00:12:27.180 --> 00:12:30.480 align:middle line:84%
inside this vertex
point, the zero point,

00:12:30.480 --> 00:12:33.000 align:middle line:90%
I was outside time-space.

00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:35.860 align:middle line:84%
So I was like, oh,
that's interesting.

00:12:35.860 --> 00:12:36.900 align:middle line:90%
Where did I go?

00:12:36.900 --> 00:12:39.580 align:middle line:90%
I had no sense of time-space.

00:12:39.580 --> 00:12:43.410 align:middle line:84%
And then there would be
all of these vertex points

00:12:43.410 --> 00:12:45.490 align:middle line:84%
that are corresponding
to the same thing.

00:12:45.490 --> 00:12:48.090 align:middle line:84%
So eventually, I
realized that that

00:12:48.090 --> 00:12:51.780 align:middle line:84%
is the network that
we exist in that

00:12:51.780 --> 00:12:54.900 align:middle line:90%
literally divides space-time.

00:12:54.900 --> 00:12:57.420 align:middle line:84%
And it gives us this
impression that we

00:12:57.420 --> 00:13:00.040 align:middle line:90%
are functioning this way.

00:13:00.040 --> 00:13:04.080 align:middle line:84%
And then I went to another
point, and at that time,

00:13:04.080 --> 00:13:04.980 align:middle line:90%
it took me.

00:13:04.980 --> 00:13:06.910 align:middle line:90%
I literally felt transported.

00:13:06.910 --> 00:13:11.370 align:middle line:84%
I felt like I could just go to
the moon, like just transported.

00:13:11.370 --> 00:13:13.530 align:middle line:84%
Again, I'm going to
skip through that.

00:13:13.530 --> 00:13:17.160 align:middle line:84%
Basically, it was
different points

00:13:17.160 --> 00:13:19.380 align:middle line:90%
would do different things.

00:13:19.380 --> 00:13:22.420 align:middle line:84%
That was a transport
grid, basically.

00:13:22.420 --> 00:13:25.930 align:middle line:84%
But then I got to a point,
and I saw all these codes.

00:13:25.930 --> 00:13:26.880 align:middle line:90%
Yay.

00:13:26.880 --> 00:13:30.810 align:middle line:84%
Now you're trying to see
why I'm getting to all this.

00:13:30.810 --> 00:13:36.010 align:middle line:84%
Codes of communication
going like a computer.

00:13:36.010 --> 00:13:37.650 align:middle line:90%
It was so cool.

00:13:37.650 --> 00:13:43.630 align:middle line:84%
And so I realized that there is
a whole network of information.

00:13:43.630 --> 00:13:47.940 align:middle line:84%
And that's how information
is transferred in the ether,

00:13:47.940 --> 00:13:50.430 align:middle line:90%
basically, in space.

00:13:50.430 --> 00:13:53.400 align:middle line:90%
And it wasn't just human codes.

00:13:53.400 --> 00:13:55.450 align:middle line:90%
It was any codes.

00:13:55.450 --> 00:13:57.400 align:middle line:90%
It was universal codes.

00:13:57.400 --> 00:13:58.840 align:middle line:90%
So that was super cool.

00:13:58.840 --> 00:14:02.410 align:middle line:84%
And I realized that
it's not just random.

00:14:02.410 --> 00:14:05.220 align:middle line:84%
It's not just, hey, I'm just
going to think of something,

00:14:05.220 --> 00:14:06.250 align:middle line:90%
and it floats.

00:14:06.250 --> 00:14:08.190 align:middle line:90%
My thought floats in space.

00:14:08.190 --> 00:14:10.800 align:middle line:84%
And then hopefully,
my friend will get it.

00:14:10.800 --> 00:14:12.130 align:middle line:90%
It's not like that.

00:14:12.130 --> 00:14:15.150 align:middle line:90%
It's actually very organized.

00:14:15.150 --> 00:14:17.650 align:middle line:84%
In fact, yeah,
that's my favorite.

00:14:17.650 --> 00:14:23.880 align:middle line:84%
In fact, I realized that there
is actually a correlation

00:14:23.880 --> 00:14:27.420 align:middle line:90%
with the geometry of the brain.

00:14:27.420 --> 00:14:30.730 align:middle line:84%
So now it started
to be interesting.

00:14:30.730 --> 00:14:34.890 align:middle line:10%
So if you don't believe me,
I started to look into it,

00:14:34.890 --> 00:14:36.730 align:middle line:10%
talking to different scientists.

00:14:36.730 --> 00:14:37.990 align:middle line:90%
So check out this guy.

00:14:37.990 --> 00:14:39.370 align:middle line:90%
This is NIH.

00:14:39.370 --> 00:14:43.080 align:middle line:84%
So very established,
organized version.

00:14:43.080 --> 00:14:46.870 align:middle line:84%
So they were studying
the monkey brain.

00:14:46.870 --> 00:14:49.230 align:middle line:90%
And they find out--

00:14:49.230 --> 00:14:50.597 align:middle line:90%
look at what it says.

00:14:50.597 --> 00:14:51.930 align:middle line:90%
I don't know if you can read it.

00:14:51.930 --> 00:14:56.550 align:middle line:10%
But it says, "It seems like this
network of highways and byways

00:14:56.550 --> 00:14:59.760 align:middle line:10%
is laid out when we're
still an early fetus.

00:14:59.760 --> 00:15:04.440 align:middle line:10%
At a very early stage, our
brains form three primal

00:15:04.440 --> 00:15:10.470 align:middle line:10%
pathways that traverse our
brain horizontally, vertically,

00:15:10.470 --> 00:15:15.000 align:middle line:10%
and transversely," because I
forgot to tell you that the grid

00:15:15.000 --> 00:15:19.920 align:middle line:10%
is based on the tetrahedron,
which is triangles.

00:15:19.920 --> 00:15:21.070 align:middle line:90%
Make sense?

00:15:21.070 --> 00:15:25.980 align:middle line:84%
And so, "The NIH scientists
now think that those early

00:15:25.980 --> 00:15:30.300 align:middle line:84%
connections act as markers,
forcing the continued growth

00:15:30.300 --> 00:15:33.870 align:middle line:84%
of an orderly
grid-like structure."

00:15:33.870 --> 00:15:35.220 align:middle line:90%
Interesting.

00:15:35.220 --> 00:15:40.780 align:middle line:84%
So our brains function like
a grid, are made like a grid.

00:15:40.780 --> 00:15:42.130 align:middle line:90%
Here's another one.

00:15:42.130 --> 00:15:45.000 align:middle line:84%
This is the University
o London College--

00:15:45.000 --> 00:15:47.250 align:middle line:90%
University College in London.

00:15:47.250 --> 00:15:52.380 align:middle line:84%
Dr. Caswell Barry said, "It
is as if grid cells provide

00:15:52.380 --> 00:15:54.730 align:middle line:90%
a cognitive map of space."

00:15:54.730 --> 00:15:55.620 align:middle line:90%
Interesting.

00:15:55.620 --> 00:15:58.770 align:middle line:84%
"In fact, these cells are
very much like the longitude

00:15:58.770 --> 00:16:03.580 align:middle line:84%
and latitude lines we're all
familiar with on a normal map,

00:16:03.580 --> 00:16:06.300 align:middle line:84%
but instead of using
square grid lines,

00:16:06.300 --> 00:16:09.750 align:middle line:84%
it seems the brain
uses triangles."

00:16:09.750 --> 00:16:11.040 align:middle line:90%
Interesting.

00:16:11.040 --> 00:16:13.080 align:middle line:90%
Is this a coincidence?

00:16:13.080 --> 00:16:14.200 align:middle line:90%
I don't think so.

00:16:14.200 --> 00:16:15.090 align:middle line:90%
Yeah?

00:16:15.090 --> 00:16:18.210 align:middle line:84%
So anyway, of course,
Carl Sagan told us

00:16:18.210 --> 00:16:20.690 align:middle line:90%
we're made of star stuff.

00:16:20.690 --> 00:16:22.400 align:middle line:84%
We're not just
made of star stuff.

00:16:22.400 --> 00:16:24.130 align:middle line:90%
This is not just a concept.

00:16:24.130 --> 00:16:25.570 align:middle line:90%
This is real.

00:16:25.570 --> 00:16:28.260 align:middle line:84%
Our particles,
our cells are made

00:16:28.260 --> 00:16:32.370 align:middle line:84%
from the actual
stuff, the actual star

00:16:32.370 --> 00:16:34.630 align:middle line:90%
dust within the universe.

00:16:34.630 --> 00:16:38.760 align:middle line:84%
And look, I mean, we don't
just-- we're not just made

00:16:38.760 --> 00:16:40.360 align:middle line:90%
of the same substance.

00:16:40.360 --> 00:16:43.330 align:middle line:90%
We look like the universe.

00:16:43.330 --> 00:16:44.220 align:middle line:90%
Look at the brain.

00:16:44.220 --> 00:16:45.910 align:middle line:90%
And look at the universe.

00:16:45.910 --> 00:16:47.070 align:middle line:90%
See?

00:16:47.070 --> 00:16:50.370 align:middle line:84%
Does that look like
something very, very similar?

00:16:50.370 --> 00:16:56.190 align:middle line:84%
So all this to say
that our geometry is

00:16:56.190 --> 00:17:02.010 align:middle line:84%
perfectly coherent with
the geometry of space-time.

00:17:02.010 --> 00:17:06.609 align:middle line:84%
Are you starting to see the
connection that it's not random?

00:17:06.609 --> 00:17:09.089 align:middle line:84%
It's not just like,
hey, let's put

00:17:09.089 --> 00:17:11.790 align:middle line:84%
a bunch of intelligent
beings on this planet,

00:17:11.790 --> 00:17:13.690 align:middle line:90%
and let's hope for the best.

00:17:13.690 --> 00:17:17.980 align:middle line:10%
There is an orderly,
divine, intelligent--

00:17:17.980 --> 00:17:20.069 align:middle line:10%
there is an intelligent design.

00:17:20.069 --> 00:17:24.210 align:middle line:90%
And so even at a Planck scale--

00:17:24.210 --> 00:17:28.690 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I can go on and on,
but I like to bring science.

00:17:28.690 --> 00:17:31.320 align:middle line:90%
I like to bring evidence.

00:17:31.320 --> 00:17:35.700 align:middle line:84%
Like I said, I'm
like a nerd that way.

00:17:35.700 --> 00:17:38.550 align:middle line:84%
I don't want to just believe
stuff because somebody said so.

00:17:38.550 --> 00:17:39.520 align:middle line:90%
You know what I mean?

00:17:39.520 --> 00:17:42.160 align:middle line:84%
And so that's why
I do my homework.

00:17:42.160 --> 00:17:44.040 align:middle line:84%
And after years
and years and years

00:17:44.040 --> 00:17:47.890 align:middle line:84%
of working on myself
and everything else

00:17:47.890 --> 00:17:50.860 align:middle line:84%
and with the scientists,
you do find evidence.

00:17:50.860 --> 00:17:52.900 align:middle line:84%
Of course, nobody
teaches us this stuff.

00:17:52.900 --> 00:17:56.310 align:middle line:10%
But at a Planck scale,
the fabric of space-time

00:17:56.310 --> 00:17:59.620 align:middle line:10%
is a geometric
network of wormholes.

00:17:59.620 --> 00:18:00.950 align:middle line:10%
That's not me saying that.

00:18:00.950 --> 00:18:02.740 align:middle line:10%
This is the paper--

00:18:02.740 --> 00:18:06.920 align:middle line:10%
scientific report
that found that out.

00:18:06.920 --> 00:18:09.710 align:middle line:10%
The fabric of
space-time is geometric.

00:18:09.710 --> 00:18:12.460 align:middle line:10%
Also, they find out--
again, these are not--

00:18:12.460 --> 00:18:13.660 align:middle line:10%
this is not me saying.

00:18:13.660 --> 00:18:16.870 align:middle line:10%
It is the scientists.

00:18:16.870 --> 00:18:22.390 align:middle line:10%
They say the processing of
the brain, the way the brain

00:18:22.390 --> 00:18:27.370 align:middle line:10%
processes information, is the
same as the universe in terms

00:18:27.370 --> 00:18:31.370 align:middle line:10%
of mechanism and capacity.

00:18:31.370 --> 00:18:34.120 align:middle line:10%
Capacity.

00:18:34.120 --> 00:18:37.330 align:middle line:90%
Does that make sense.

00:18:37.330 --> 00:18:42.790 align:middle line:10%
So our brains can do as
much as the entire universe?

00:18:42.790 --> 00:18:46.810 align:middle line:84%
How come we feel like
total morons sometimes?

00:18:46.810 --> 00:18:50.530 align:middle line:84%
But I mean, seriously, we
feel like so inadequate

00:18:50.530 --> 00:18:52.220 align:middle line:90%
and small and finite.

00:18:52.220 --> 00:18:54.820 align:middle line:84%
And yet there is
scientific evidence

00:18:54.820 --> 00:18:58.540 align:middle line:84%
that our brains can process
so much information.

00:18:58.540 --> 00:19:02.890 align:middle line:10%
Also, there's quantum
coherence with the DNA.

00:19:02.890 --> 00:19:05.000 align:middle line:10%
This is my absolute favorite.

00:19:05.000 --> 00:19:06.020 align:middle line:90%
Check this out.

00:19:06.020 --> 00:19:11.020 align:middle line:84%
So there is this
scientist in Germany--

00:19:11.020 --> 00:19:12.190 align:middle line:90%
actually, Switzerland.

00:19:12.190 --> 00:19:17.500 align:middle line:90%
And his name is Konstantin Meyl.

00:19:17.500 --> 00:19:22.120 align:middle line:84%
He was doing research on cell
resonance, cell connection

00:19:22.120 --> 00:19:24.260 align:middle line:84%
and communication
between two cells.

00:19:24.260 --> 00:19:26.870 align:middle line:90%
How do two cells communicate?

00:19:26.870 --> 00:19:29.890 align:middle line:10%
And as he is doing
this research,

00:19:29.890 --> 00:19:34.030 align:middle line:10%
he finds out he was able to
demonstrate mathematically

00:19:34.030 --> 00:19:40.810 align:middle line:10%
that the double helix of the
DNA uses magnetic scalar waves

00:19:40.810 --> 00:19:45.890 align:middle line:10%
and acts like a cellular tower
by receiving and transmitting

00:19:45.890 --> 00:19:50.840 align:middle line:10%
information, carrying
photons to establish

00:19:50.840 --> 00:19:55.280 align:middle line:10%
a coresonance of photons,
not only within the body

00:19:55.280 --> 00:19:59.990 align:middle line:10%
but throughout the
universe, using a background

00:19:59.990 --> 00:20:05.270 align:middle line:10%
network of scalar energy,
referred to as zero point,

00:20:05.270 --> 00:20:10.110 align:middle line:10%
as the transferring medium.

00:20:10.110 --> 00:20:14.860 align:middle line:84%
So it's sending information
not just within the body.

00:20:14.860 --> 00:20:18.720 align:middle line:10%
The DNA is sending information
not just within the body

00:20:18.720 --> 00:20:23.130 align:middle line:10%
but across the universe,
using specific--

00:20:23.130 --> 00:20:25.650 align:middle line:10%
what we call magnetic
scalar waves, which I'm

00:20:25.650 --> 00:20:27.590 align:middle line:10%
going to get to in a second.

00:20:27.590 --> 00:20:32.820 align:middle line:84%
So this means that this
guy has demonstrated

00:20:32.820 --> 00:20:36.960 align:middle line:84%
that it's possible
for the human DNA

00:20:36.960 --> 00:20:39.310 align:middle line:90%
to send and receive information.

00:20:39.310 --> 00:20:41.410 align:middle line:90%
That's what this means.

00:20:41.410 --> 00:20:47.590 align:middle line:84%
So we're not all crazy when
we do get a telepathic message

00:20:47.590 --> 00:20:51.490 align:middle line:84%
from someone, when we get a
download from an alien floating

00:20:51.490 --> 00:20:52.470 align:middle line:90%
somewhere.

00:20:52.470 --> 00:20:58.420 align:middle line:84%
It means that there is the
possibility that your DNA is

00:20:58.420 --> 00:21:01.280 align:middle line:90%
actually doing that for real.

00:21:01.280 --> 00:21:03.150 align:middle line:90%
It's not made up.

00:21:03.150 --> 00:21:04.200 align:middle line:90%
But let's talk about--

00:21:04.200 --> 00:21:06.250 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to come back
to the scalar wave.

00:21:06.250 --> 00:21:08.530 align:middle line:84%
It's super cool, and
it's very important.

00:21:08.530 --> 00:21:10.570 align:middle line:90%
But let's talk about telepathy.

00:21:10.570 --> 00:21:13.260 align:middle line:84%
So if you look-- if you
open the dictionary,

00:21:13.260 --> 00:21:17.700 align:middle line:84%
telepathy, they define it as
a direct transfer of thought

00:21:17.700 --> 00:21:21.000 align:middle line:84%
from one person to
another without using

00:21:21.000 --> 00:21:23.290 align:middle line:84%
the normal channels
of communication,

00:21:23.290 --> 00:21:26.380 align:middle line:84%
meaning I'm transferring my
thought into your brains.

00:21:26.380 --> 00:21:31.350 align:middle line:84%
You're doing the same thing with
me without speaking or hearing.

00:21:31.350 --> 00:21:34.600 align:middle line:90%
That's the definition out there.

00:21:34.600 --> 00:21:39.660 align:middle line:84%
But telepathy, it's not
just a thought transfer,

00:21:39.660 --> 00:21:41.170 align:middle line:90%
because thought is just an idea.

00:21:41.170 --> 00:21:43.410 align:middle line:84%
The process of
thinking, something

00:21:43.410 --> 00:21:45.220 align:middle line:90%
suddenly pops in your head.

00:21:45.220 --> 00:21:46.900 align:middle line:90%
That's what a thought is.

00:21:46.900 --> 00:21:48.840 align:middle line:90%
But what about intuition?

00:21:48.840 --> 00:21:52.680 align:middle line:84%
What about if I'm just thinking
of someone and then the phone

00:21:52.680 --> 00:21:54.010 align:middle line:90%
rings and it's them?

00:21:54.010 --> 00:21:56.560 align:middle line:84%
I bet everybody's had
this experience, right?

00:21:56.560 --> 00:21:57.360 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:21:57.360 --> 00:21:58.890 align:middle line:90%
What about empathy?

00:21:58.890 --> 00:22:03.820 align:middle line:84%
How about when I'm in the
presence of someone and I

00:22:03.820 --> 00:22:07.340 align:middle line:84%
sense that there's
something wrong?

00:22:07.340 --> 00:22:09.470 align:middle line:90%
What am I picking up?

00:22:09.470 --> 00:22:13.900 align:middle line:84%
What is this transfer
of energy from--

00:22:13.900 --> 00:22:17.770 align:middle line:84%
they didn't think, oh, you
know, I feel bad today.

00:22:17.770 --> 00:22:19.430 align:middle line:90%
And I hope Caroline picks it up.

00:22:19.430 --> 00:22:21.122 align:middle line:90%
Of course not.

00:22:21.122 --> 00:22:28.270 align:middle line:84%
So they are emitting some sort
of signal that is nonverbal.

00:22:28.270 --> 00:22:30.760 align:middle line:90%
And yet I got the message.

00:22:30.760 --> 00:22:31.850 align:middle line:90%
That's empathy.

00:22:31.850 --> 00:22:36.220 align:middle line:90%
And so also the downloads?

00:22:36.220 --> 00:22:42.220 align:middle line:84%
Of course, we've heard sometimes
you get an idea out of nowhere.

00:22:42.220 --> 00:22:43.730 align:middle line:90%
Where did it come from?

00:22:43.730 --> 00:22:45.310 align:middle line:90%
Make sense?

00:22:45.310 --> 00:22:49.930 align:middle line:84%
And you know it's not you
because the information is not

00:22:49.930 --> 00:22:51.630 align:middle line:90%
even your field of study.

00:22:51.630 --> 00:22:54.100 align:middle line:90%
How come sometimes-- you're--

00:22:54.100 --> 00:22:56.680 align:middle line:84%
I don't know-- just a normal
housewife or something.

00:22:56.680 --> 00:23:03.700 align:middle line:84%
And all of a sudden, you
download a science equation

00:23:03.700 --> 00:23:05.100 align:middle line:90%
or something?

00:23:05.100 --> 00:23:07.980 align:middle line:84%
You know that's not you,
because you never studied.

00:23:07.980 --> 00:23:08.800 align:middle line:90%
Make sense?

00:23:08.800 --> 00:23:10.950 align:middle line:90%
So where did this come from?

00:23:10.950 --> 00:23:14.940 align:middle line:84%
And how did it get
transferred into you?

00:23:14.940 --> 00:23:18.340 align:middle line:84%
So this wasn't a thought
transfer, you see?

00:23:18.340 --> 00:23:22.770 align:middle line:84%
So for me, telepathy
is all of that--

00:23:22.770 --> 00:23:26.680 align:middle line:90%
is the transfer of information.

00:23:26.680 --> 00:23:29.490 align:middle line:84%
It's all information
energy that's

00:23:29.490 --> 00:23:31.200 align:middle line:84%
being transferred
from one person

00:23:31.200 --> 00:23:33.630 align:middle line:90%
to another, not just a person.

00:23:33.630 --> 00:23:39.360 align:middle line:84%
How many of you-- like,
you walk in a store and--

00:23:39.360 --> 00:23:41.940 align:middle line:90%
let's say, a furniture store.

00:23:41.940 --> 00:23:43.560 align:middle line:90%
And you want to buy a couch.

00:23:43.560 --> 00:23:45.870 align:middle line:90%
And then here's a couch.

00:23:45.870 --> 00:23:48.990 align:middle line:84%
It's like two couches that
look exactly the same.

00:23:48.990 --> 00:23:50.350 align:middle line:90%
Exactly the same.

00:23:50.350 --> 00:23:54.490 align:middle line:84%
But you're drawn towards
one more than another.

00:23:54.490 --> 00:23:56.260 align:middle line:84%
Or you say, I'm going
to take this one.

00:23:56.260 --> 00:23:57.420 align:middle line:90%
Why not that one?

00:23:57.420 --> 00:23:58.480 align:middle line:90%
Does that make sense?

00:23:58.480 --> 00:24:04.240 align:middle line:84%
You sense information is still
stored in even material things,

00:24:04.240 --> 00:24:05.270 align:middle line:90%
believe it or not.

00:24:05.270 --> 00:24:10.270 align:middle line:84%
And it still is carrying those
signals that you pick up.

00:24:10.270 --> 00:24:13.330 align:middle line:84%
Same when you go
to the supermarket,

00:24:13.330 --> 00:24:15.400 align:middle line:84%
and you're picking
up fruit and stuff.

00:24:15.400 --> 00:24:16.250 align:middle line:90%
You take your time.

00:24:16.250 --> 00:24:18.400 align:middle line:84%
Of course, you want the ones
that don't look all crooked

00:24:18.400 --> 00:24:19.270 align:middle line:90%
and everything.

00:24:19.270 --> 00:24:22.070 align:middle line:90%
But still.

00:24:22.070 --> 00:24:27.130 align:middle line:84%
So there's information that is
being transferred to you all

00:24:27.130 --> 00:24:28.210 align:middle line:90%
the time.

00:24:28.210 --> 00:24:31.240 align:middle line:84%
And we're not paying
attention to how

00:24:31.240 --> 00:24:33.250 align:middle line:84%
this transfer is
happening, which is

00:24:33.250 --> 00:24:35.420 align:middle line:90%
what we're talking about today.

00:24:35.420 --> 00:24:41.830 align:middle line:84%
So same thing with
emotions, like I was saying.

00:24:41.830 --> 00:24:44.830 align:middle line:90%
For example, I meet my friend.

00:24:44.830 --> 00:24:49.580 align:middle line:84%
And I say, oh, you look great,
or your hair looks great.

00:24:49.580 --> 00:24:52.635 align:middle line:84%
And in my mind, I'm thinking,
oh my god, she looks so tired.

00:24:52.635 --> 00:24:56.500 align:middle line:90%


00:24:56.500 --> 00:25:02.250 align:middle line:84%
But I bet that she felt
that I wasn't sincere.

00:25:02.250 --> 00:25:05.440 align:middle line:90%
This happens all the time.

00:25:05.440 --> 00:25:08.730 align:middle line:84%
So it's like our human
brains, our human mind

00:25:08.730 --> 00:25:11.610 align:middle line:84%
is communicating through
the normal channels.

00:25:11.610 --> 00:25:17.250 align:middle line:84%
But then our energy is
also sending and receiving

00:25:17.250 --> 00:25:20.160 align:middle line:90%
signals we're not aware of.

00:25:20.160 --> 00:25:22.540 align:middle line:84%
So the idea, why
is this important?

00:25:22.540 --> 00:25:25.920 align:middle line:90%
Because we are not--

00:25:25.920 --> 00:25:30.120 align:middle line:84%
if we don't understand this
entire phenomenon, which

00:25:30.120 --> 00:25:32.610 align:middle line:84%
is all under
telepathy, then we're

00:25:32.610 --> 00:25:34.320 align:middle line:90%
not understanding who we are.

00:25:34.320 --> 00:25:38.820 align:middle line:84%
And we're not utilizing
our entire being

00:25:38.820 --> 00:25:42.740 align:middle line:84%
to retrieve the proper
information and discernment.

00:25:42.740 --> 00:25:47.240 align:middle line:84%
So anyway, let me confuse
you a little bit more.

00:25:47.240 --> 00:25:50.820 align:middle line:84%
As I mentioned, I can
see the subtle energy.

00:25:50.820 --> 00:25:54.410 align:middle line:84%
And what happened is that as I'm
working with different people,

00:25:54.410 --> 00:26:01.790 align:middle line:84%
I noticed that in addition
to their own consciousness,

00:26:01.790 --> 00:26:08.310 align:middle line:84%
I see energy of other people
in them, like thought forms.

00:26:08.310 --> 00:26:11.540 align:middle line:84%
And so sometimes,
like, let's say

00:26:11.540 --> 00:26:15.770 align:middle line:84%
they're struggling with
chronic headaches or something,

00:26:15.770 --> 00:26:17.910 align:middle line:84%
or chronic stomach
aches or something.

00:26:17.910 --> 00:26:21.050 align:middle line:84%
And when I pick up
that information,

00:26:21.050 --> 00:26:22.910 align:middle line:90%
I see that it's not them.

00:26:22.910 --> 00:26:28.170 align:middle line:84%
It's the mother
or somebody else.

00:26:28.170 --> 00:26:30.950 align:middle line:84%
In addition to
receiving information,

00:26:30.950 --> 00:26:35.360 align:middle line:84%
we also pick up other
people's frequency.

00:26:35.360 --> 00:26:38.130 align:middle line:90%
And we keep them into our cells.

00:26:38.130 --> 00:26:41.600 align:middle line:90%
For example, my mother got sick.

00:26:41.600 --> 00:26:43.980 align:middle line:84%
She had Alzheimer's
or something.

00:26:43.980 --> 00:26:48.720 align:middle line:84%
So we keep that
thought form within us

00:26:48.720 --> 00:26:53.920 align:middle line:84%
to eventually create a belief
system that when I grow old,

00:26:53.920 --> 00:26:54.720 align:middle line:90%
am I--

00:26:54.720 --> 00:26:57.000 align:middle line:84%
I am also going
to have the same.

00:26:57.000 --> 00:26:57.970 align:middle line:90%
You see what I mean?

00:26:57.970 --> 00:27:00.690 align:middle line:84%
So as I'm clearing
someone or we're

00:27:00.690 --> 00:27:05.910 align:middle line:84%
working with someone, for those
of you who did work with me,

00:27:05.910 --> 00:27:07.020 align:middle line:90%
I say--

00:27:07.020 --> 00:27:10.920 align:middle line:84%
I ask to release my
mother's frequency

00:27:10.920 --> 00:27:15.430 align:middle line:84%
of fear of this disease,
because it's not even yours.

00:27:15.430 --> 00:27:16.690 align:middle line:90%
Think about this.

00:27:16.690 --> 00:27:20.660 align:middle line:84%
So we walk around carrying other
people's stuff, other people's

00:27:20.660 --> 00:27:21.460 align:middle line:90%
energy.

00:27:21.460 --> 00:27:25.560 align:middle line:84%
This is the grandfather
that's deceased.

00:27:25.560 --> 00:27:30.070 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes I see these
energies also in your field.

00:27:30.070 --> 00:27:34.870 align:middle line:84%
And sometimes it's not just
somebody that's deceased.

00:27:34.870 --> 00:27:39.210 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes it's the actual
father that we carry around.

00:27:39.210 --> 00:27:40.840 align:middle line:90%
Why is this important?

00:27:40.840 --> 00:27:46.650 align:middle line:84%
Because your being, your field,
there should be no one, no one,

00:27:46.650 --> 00:27:48.010 align:middle line:90%
except you.

00:27:48.010 --> 00:27:51.750 align:middle line:84%
And yet we walk around
with all these energies

00:27:51.750 --> 00:27:55.110 align:middle line:84%
that got transferred
into our beings

00:27:55.110 --> 00:27:58.030 align:middle line:84%
without being aware
of what's going on.

00:27:58.030 --> 00:28:00.450 align:middle line:84%
And so sometimes
this is so important

00:28:00.450 --> 00:28:02.520 align:middle line:90%
because the discernment--

00:28:02.520 --> 00:28:05.070 align:middle line:84%
that's the biggest
thing, is discerning,

00:28:05.070 --> 00:28:09.400 align:middle line:84%
knowing exactly what's
going on in my being.

00:28:09.400 --> 00:28:12.280 align:middle line:90%
Why am I stuck in this pattern?

00:28:12.280 --> 00:28:16.860 align:middle line:84%
Why am I stuck
with this illness?

00:28:16.860 --> 00:28:18.750 align:middle line:90%
So you're treating the symptom.

00:28:18.750 --> 00:28:20.590 align:middle line:90%
You're treating the problem.

00:28:20.590 --> 00:28:23.520 align:middle line:84%
But if you actually
know and you learn

00:28:23.520 --> 00:28:26.260 align:middle line:84%
to discern that it's not
you, it's your mother,

00:28:26.260 --> 00:28:28.380 align:middle line:84%
and all you have to
do is take her out,

00:28:28.380 --> 00:28:32.940 align:middle line:84%
and boom, you're healed, isn't
that much better, faster?

00:28:32.940 --> 00:28:37.420 align:middle line:84%
Save a lot of money on
drugs and everything else.

00:28:37.420 --> 00:28:41.040 align:middle line:84%
And sometimes you have to
realize that sometimes we

00:28:41.040 --> 00:28:45.720 align:middle line:84%
don't do this because it's
something from a negative place.

00:28:45.720 --> 00:28:48.330 align:middle line:84%
So for example, what
I'm saying is sometimes

00:28:48.330 --> 00:28:50.850 align:middle line:84%
I see we carry our
children with us.

00:28:50.850 --> 00:28:53.580 align:middle line:90%
And because we love them--

00:28:53.580 --> 00:28:56.730 align:middle line:84%
and so you think-- you
say, but there's nothing--

00:28:56.730 --> 00:28:58.390 align:middle line:84%
I don't have a problem
with my mother.

00:28:58.390 --> 00:28:59.850 align:middle line:90%
I get along with her great.

00:28:59.850 --> 00:29:00.760 align:middle line:90%
Yes!

00:29:00.760 --> 00:29:01.718 align:middle line:90%
And I love my daughter.

00:29:01.718 --> 00:29:02.518 align:middle line:90%
Of course!

00:29:02.518 --> 00:29:03.370 align:middle line:90%
Of course.

00:29:03.370 --> 00:29:07.990 align:middle line:84%
But they shouldn't
be in your field.

00:29:07.990 --> 00:29:09.560 align:middle line:84%
They should not
be in your field.

00:29:09.560 --> 00:29:11.170 align:middle line:84%
They should not
be in your cells,

00:29:11.170 --> 00:29:14.560 align:middle line:90%
because you are information.

00:29:14.560 --> 00:29:16.960 align:middle line:84%
You are sending and
receiving information.

00:29:16.960 --> 00:29:19.120 align:middle line:90%
And there's two of you now.

00:29:19.120 --> 00:29:20.530 align:middle line:90%
Make sense?

00:29:20.530 --> 00:29:21.740 align:middle line:90%
You see what I mean?

00:29:21.740 --> 00:29:24.910 align:middle line:84%
So the idea-- and here's
the little cute alien there,

00:29:24.910 --> 00:29:27.670 align:middle line:84%
because sometimes there's
a cute little alien that

00:29:27.670 --> 00:29:33.200 align:middle line:84%
hangs out in your field and
start just telling you stories.

00:29:33.200 --> 00:29:38.080 align:middle line:84%
So it's cute when it's
a Pleiadian telling you

00:29:38.080 --> 00:29:42.910 align:middle line:84%
all this very important stuff
about the future of humanity

00:29:42.910 --> 00:29:44.480 align:middle line:90%
and the planet.

00:29:44.480 --> 00:29:49.240 align:middle line:10%
But when it's confusing
and it's distracting, why?

00:29:49.240 --> 00:29:52.540 align:middle line:10%
Sometimes I see people
tell me, oh, I really

00:29:52.540 --> 00:29:54.860 align:middle line:10%
want to communicate
with the aliens.

00:29:54.860 --> 00:29:56.810 align:middle line:10%
I'm like, just like any alien?

00:29:56.810 --> 00:29:59.350 align:middle line:10%
And then they're like--

00:29:59.350 --> 00:30:01.480 align:middle line:10%
because, listen,
I mean, come on.

00:30:01.480 --> 00:30:03.880 align:middle line:10%
For example, would you hang
out with every neighbor

00:30:03.880 --> 00:30:05.770 align:middle line:10%
in your building?

00:30:05.770 --> 00:30:06.880 align:middle line:90%
Why?

00:30:06.880 --> 00:30:07.680 align:middle line:90%
Why?

00:30:07.680 --> 00:30:10.900 align:middle line:90%


00:30:10.900 --> 00:30:12.830 align:middle line:90%
Creation is purposeful.

00:30:12.830 --> 00:30:13.630 align:middle line:90%
You see?

00:30:13.630 --> 00:30:16.880 align:middle line:84%
You're here for a
specific higher purpose.

00:30:16.880 --> 00:30:21.940 align:middle line:10%
And so the clearer you are,
the faster you get on that path

00:30:21.940 --> 00:30:22.910 align:middle line:10%
and you get on with it.

00:30:22.910 --> 00:30:23.710 align:middle line:90%
You see?

00:30:23.710 --> 00:30:26.110 align:middle line:84%
The reason why we're
stuck is because we

00:30:26.110 --> 00:30:28.820 align:middle line:84%
have this energy and that
energy and confused about this.

00:30:28.820 --> 00:30:30.410 align:middle line:90%
And what do I do about that?

00:30:30.410 --> 00:30:31.430 align:middle line:90%
And blah, blah, blah.

00:30:31.430 --> 00:30:34.130 align:middle line:84%
You see, all of this
is because it's energy.

00:30:34.130 --> 00:30:38.360 align:middle line:84%
It's information that's
clogging your system.

00:30:38.360 --> 00:30:41.630 align:middle line:84%
If you are clear, then
you get the message

00:30:41.630 --> 00:30:42.580 align:middle line:90%
from your higher self.

00:30:42.580 --> 00:30:44.010 align:middle line:90%
We're going to talk about that.

00:30:44.010 --> 00:30:44.970 align:middle line:90%
I am clear.

00:30:44.970 --> 00:30:45.780 align:middle line:90%
I know exactly.

00:30:45.780 --> 00:30:46.895 align:middle line:90%
It's just me.

00:30:46.895 --> 00:30:47.695 align:middle line:90%
I get the message.

00:30:47.695 --> 00:30:49.350 align:middle line:90%
Boom, I know what to do.

00:30:49.350 --> 00:30:51.100 align:middle line:90%
Make sense?

00:30:51.100 --> 00:30:54.010 align:middle line:90%
I get distracted.

00:30:54.010 --> 00:30:56.260 align:middle line:90%
I pick up some things at Costco.

00:30:56.260 --> 00:30:58.630 align:middle line:90%
All this energy jumping on you.

00:30:58.630 --> 00:30:59.780 align:middle line:90%
It's OK.

00:30:59.780 --> 00:31:00.820 align:middle line:90%
You go home.

00:31:00.820 --> 00:31:04.600 align:middle line:84%
You do an energetic
flush, energetic cleanse.

00:31:04.600 --> 00:31:06.470 align:middle line:90%
And you move on.

00:31:06.470 --> 00:31:10.690 align:middle line:84%
You keep your instrument
clear and pure.

00:31:10.690 --> 00:31:15.460 align:middle line:84%
So some people say, why do
I have to do this every day?

00:31:15.460 --> 00:31:19.040 align:middle line:84%
If I am connected to
source, that's it.

00:31:19.040 --> 00:31:24.160 align:middle line:84%
Why do I have to constantly
do this all the time?

00:31:24.160 --> 00:31:26.590 align:middle line:84%
Do you brush your
teeth every day?

00:31:26.590 --> 00:31:29.702 align:middle line:90%
Do you shower every day?

00:31:29.702 --> 00:31:33.830 align:middle line:84%
It's because we are interacting
in this physical medium.

00:31:33.830 --> 00:31:38.290 align:middle line:84%
We are constantly,
constantly emitting energy,

00:31:38.290 --> 00:31:41.120 align:middle line:90%
receiving energy constantly.

00:31:41.120 --> 00:31:43.690 align:middle line:84%
And so that's the
reason why, of course,

00:31:43.690 --> 00:31:45.650 align:middle line:90%
nobody teaches us any of this.

00:31:45.650 --> 00:31:47.200 align:middle line:84%
What you don't
see doesn't exist.

00:31:47.200 --> 00:31:48.530 align:middle line:90%
Blah, blah.

00:31:48.530 --> 00:31:53.120 align:middle line:84%
But imagine if we are
taught as children.

00:31:53.120 --> 00:31:56.190 align:middle line:84%
Just we don't have to know
all the technical stuff.

00:31:56.190 --> 00:32:00.800 align:middle line:84%
Just intend for your
intention, for your body

00:32:00.800 --> 00:32:02.990 align:middle line:90%
to be pure and clean.

00:32:02.990 --> 00:32:03.920 align:middle line:90%
Five minutes.

00:32:03.920 --> 00:32:05.300 align:middle line:90%
Five minutes.

00:32:05.300 --> 00:32:08.210 align:middle line:84%
Imagine what kind
of society we have--

00:32:08.210 --> 00:32:09.080 align:middle line:90%
we could have.

00:32:09.080 --> 00:32:12.430 align:middle line:90%
