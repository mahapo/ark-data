00:00:05.456 --> 00:00:08.928 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:08.928 --> 00:00:11.410 align:middle line:90%


00:00:11.410 --> 00:00:14.800 align:middle line:84%
>> So today's topic is something
that probably all of you know

00:00:14.800 --> 00:00:16.250 align:middle line:90%
about at this point --

00:00:16.250 --> 00:00:19.185 align:middle line:84%
TLS disclosure and
intergalactic unity.

00:00:19.185 --> 00:00:20.560 align:middle line:84%
And that's a very
important topic

00:00:20.560 --> 00:00:23.680 align:middle line:84%
right now because there is
a lot of talks in the news

00:00:23.680 --> 00:00:26.290 align:middle line:84%
and the mainstream media, all
about extraterrestrial life.

00:00:26.290 --> 00:00:29.860 align:middle line:84%
And after all, this event is
called Stairway to the Stars.

00:00:29.860 --> 00:00:31.330 align:middle line:90%
How do we reach the stars?

00:00:31.330 --> 00:00:33.382 align:middle line:84%
How do we unite
with other races?

00:00:33.382 --> 00:00:34.840 align:middle line:84%
Because I think
it's pretty obvious

00:00:34.840 --> 00:00:36.640 align:middle line:84%
that there are other
races among us.

00:00:36.640 --> 00:00:38.410 align:middle line:10%
At this point, the
people that have

00:00:38.410 --> 00:00:41.260 align:middle line:10%
been lying to us for a very long
time are even admitting to that.

00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:43.010 align:middle line:10%
They're just telling
us that they're evil,

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:45.910 align:middle line:10%
and they're here to eat you and
kill you and drink your blood.

00:00:45.910 --> 00:00:48.550 align:middle line:84%
And today, we're going
to take all of that

00:00:48.550 --> 00:00:51.890 align:middle line:84%
and shift the narrative and show
you a completely different way,

00:00:51.890 --> 00:00:54.790 align:middle line:84%
not just through trusting me
and trusting what I'm saying,

00:00:54.790 --> 00:00:56.680 align:middle line:84%
but I want you
guys to understand

00:00:56.680 --> 00:00:57.920 align:middle line:90%
how to think for yourself.

00:00:57.920 --> 00:01:00.520 align:middle line:84%
So I'm going to drive you
guys and ride you guys

00:01:00.520 --> 00:01:03.740 align:middle line:84%
through that logic to understand
how you can make sense of this.

00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:06.070 align:middle line:84%
So when somebody comes with
a different perspective,

00:01:06.070 --> 00:01:07.090 align:middle line:90%
you can honor it.

00:01:07.090 --> 00:01:09.910 align:middle line:84%
You can respect it, but you
can also have ammunition

00:01:09.910 --> 00:01:12.650 align:middle line:84%
to be able to ask them the
proper questions to think

00:01:12.650 --> 00:01:15.660 align:middle line:84%
critically and understand things
in a completely different way.

00:01:15.660 --> 00:01:19.130 align:middle line:84%
So TLS disclosure and
intergalactic unity.

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:20.720 align:middle line:84%
The first thing I
want to start on

00:01:20.720 --> 00:01:23.810 align:middle line:84%
is called the dark
and the light.

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:27.050 align:middle line:84%
How many of you know
of dark organizations,

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:28.310 align:middle line:90%
evil organizations?

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:30.260 align:middle line:84%
Can we agree-- raise
your hand if you

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:32.330 align:middle line:84%
agree and can get
behind the fact

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:34.973 align:middle line:84%
that there are evil
organizations or corporations

00:01:34.973 --> 00:01:36.140 align:middle line:90%
or individuals in the world?

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:37.850 align:middle line:84%
Raise your hand if
you agree with that.

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:39.800 align:middle line:90%
So, OK, beautiful.

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:41.690 align:middle line:84%
Everybody basically
agrees with that fact

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:42.930 align:middle line:90%
because we know who they are.

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:44.138 align:middle line:10%
We know some of them by name.

00:01:44.138 --> 00:01:46.222 align:middle line:84%
I'm not going to name them
here because that's not

00:01:46.222 --> 00:01:47.690 align:middle line:90%
the point of this presentation.

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:49.730 align:middle line:84%
But now, I'm going
to pose a question.

00:01:49.730 --> 00:01:53.360 align:middle line:84%
If we can agree, and
if it's very obvious--

00:01:53.360 --> 00:01:58.040 align:middle line:84%
blatantly obvious that there is
the negative and the dark, then

00:01:58.040 --> 00:02:01.070 align:middle line:84%
can we get behind the fact that
there is the exact opposite as

00:02:01.070 --> 00:02:01.870 align:middle line:90%
well?

00:02:01.870 --> 00:02:03.660 align:middle line:84%
Raise your hand if
that makes sense.

00:02:03.660 --> 00:02:05.790 align:middle line:90%
Raise your hand if that doesn't.

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:06.590 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:08.690 align:middle line:84%
And if it doesn't,
put me on the spot.

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:09.690 align:middle line:90%
We'll talk about it.

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:11.440 align:middle line:10%
We'll do that in the
Q&A. That's the point

00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:14.150 align:middle line:10%
of these presentations, not
to just agree, but to think

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:16.370 align:middle line:10%
critically and ask the
hard questions, to ask

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:17.640 align:middle line:10%
the skeptical questions.

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:18.890 align:middle line:90%
That's the point of what I do.

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:20.370 align:middle line:90%
It's the fun part of what I do.

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:25.190 align:middle line:84%
So again, if there's the dark,
there's the exact opposite.

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:28.340 align:middle line:84%
One of the exact
opposite organizations

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:32.250 align:middle line:84%
happens to be an organization
that approached me back in 2018

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:33.470 align:middle line:90%
and June of 2018.

00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:35.300 align:middle line:84%
And that's what really
started my journey.

00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:36.675 align:middle line:84%
We could talk
about that, and I'm

00:02:36.675 --> 00:02:38.342 align:middle line:84%
to tell you that story
in just a moment.

00:02:38.342 --> 00:02:39.800 align:middle line:84%
But the name of
that organization,

00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:42.770 align:middle line:84%
as you guys all at this
point, is TLS which

00:02:42.770 --> 00:02:45.380 align:middle line:90%
stands for The Light System.

00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:47.270 align:middle line:84%
Now before I tell
you a story, I want

00:02:47.270 --> 00:02:49.280 align:middle line:84%
to speak about who
this organization is

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:50.570 align:middle line:90%
and what this organization is.

00:02:50.570 --> 00:02:53.570 align:middle line:84%
Because, generally, when we
hear about something new,

00:02:53.570 --> 00:02:55.850 align:middle line:90%
there's skepticism.

00:02:55.850 --> 00:02:58.860 align:middle line:84%
There's how do we know
they're really good?

00:02:58.860 --> 00:03:02.030 align:middle line:84%
How do we know that they're
not bad, pretending to be good.

00:03:02.030 --> 00:03:03.780 align:middle line:84%
And all of those are
very valid questions.

00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:06.157 align:middle line:84%
Those are questions
that I ask myself.

00:03:06.157 --> 00:03:08.240 align:middle line:84%
So I'm going to give you
a quick background on who

00:03:08.240 --> 00:03:10.263 align:middle line:84%
I am, just because I want
you guys to understand

00:03:10.263 --> 00:03:11.180 align:middle line:90%
where I'm coming from.

00:03:11.180 --> 00:03:13.640 align:middle line:84%
From there, we're going
to go into understanding

00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:15.980 align:middle line:90%
what TLS truly is.

00:03:15.980 --> 00:03:18.890 align:middle line:84%
I don't come from
this world whatsoever.

00:03:18.890 --> 00:03:20.630 align:middle line:90%
I come from the business world.

00:03:20.630 --> 00:03:22.130 align:middle line:84%
I come from my
family's business,

00:03:22.130 --> 00:03:23.330 align:middle line:90%
commercial real estate.

00:03:23.330 --> 00:03:24.860 align:middle line:90%
My family's sitting in the back.

00:03:24.860 --> 00:03:27.710 align:middle line:84%
My father is there,
who used to be my boss.

00:03:27.710 --> 00:03:30.470 align:middle line:84%
He was the one that
brought me into this world,

00:03:30.470 --> 00:03:32.510 align:middle line:90%
and that's all I knew always.

00:03:32.510 --> 00:03:36.510 align:middle line:84%
Spirituality was never
anything mainstream in my life.

00:03:36.510 --> 00:03:37.910 align:middle line:90%
It was something that I enjoyed.

00:03:37.910 --> 00:03:39.780 align:middle line:84%
I watched "Ancient
Aliens" when I was a kid,

00:03:39.780 --> 00:03:42.300 align:middle line:84%
but I never told anybody because
they would think I was crazy.

00:03:42.300 --> 00:03:44.510 align:middle line:84%
So I just shut up about it
because I lived in New York,

00:03:44.510 --> 00:03:46.885 align:middle line:84%
and you can't really talk
about those things in New York.

00:03:46.885 --> 00:03:49.470 align:middle line:84%
So I did all that,
and I loved all that,

00:03:49.470 --> 00:03:50.690 align:middle line:90%
but I kept it on the side.

00:03:50.690 --> 00:03:52.280 align:middle line:90%
And it was my quiet gig.

00:03:52.280 --> 00:03:55.250 align:middle line:84%
And every time I spoke about
it, I saw, as many of you

00:03:55.250 --> 00:03:56.630 align:middle line:84%
probably had the
same experience,

00:03:56.630 --> 00:03:59.390 align:middle line:84%
people resist it and say,
how can you think that?

00:03:59.390 --> 00:04:00.740 align:middle line:90%
How can you believe that?

00:04:00.740 --> 00:04:02.210 align:middle line:90%
You must be crazy.

00:04:02.210 --> 00:04:05.060 align:middle line:84%
And now, all that truth is
starting to come to light.

00:04:05.060 --> 00:04:07.790 align:middle line:84%
So I come from the business
world, not from this world.

00:04:07.790 --> 00:04:09.540 align:middle line:84%
And the reason why I
say that is because I

00:04:09.540 --> 00:04:12.390 align:middle line:84%
want you guys to understand and
really get it through your head

00:04:12.390 --> 00:04:15.930 align:middle line:84%
that it is not easy to
convince me of something crazy.

00:04:15.930 --> 00:04:19.200 align:middle line:84%
Because I was always
surrounded by people

00:04:19.200 --> 00:04:21.640 align:middle line:84%
that couldn't be convinced
of something like that.

00:04:21.640 --> 00:04:23.850 align:middle line:84%
And I'm still surrounded
by some of those people.

00:04:23.850 --> 00:04:28.620 align:middle line:84%
Because my family that isn't
here still thinks I'm crazy.

00:04:28.620 --> 00:04:33.360 align:middle line:84%
But my point over here
is that any time I'm

00:04:33.360 --> 00:04:35.910 align:middle line:84%
faced with anything,
for example,

00:04:35.910 --> 00:04:37.110 align:middle line:90%
what the hell is this thing?

00:04:37.110 --> 00:04:39.220 align:middle line:84%
The energy enhancement
system, I looked at it.

00:04:39.220 --> 00:04:40.500 align:middle line:90%
And at first, I was skeptical.

00:04:40.500 --> 00:04:42.750 align:middle line:84%
Because I saw screens-- and
I'll talk about this later

00:04:42.750 --> 00:04:43.740 align:middle line:90%
in the presentation.

00:04:43.740 --> 00:04:45.900 align:middle line:84%
I saw screens and
lights and computers,

00:04:45.900 --> 00:04:47.093 align:middle line:90%
and it wasn't enough for me.

00:04:47.093 --> 00:04:49.510 align:middle line:84%
It's great that people are
speaking great things about it.

00:04:49.510 --> 00:04:51.310 align:middle line:84%
But I need to know
how this works.

00:04:51.310 --> 00:04:55.380 align:middle line:84%
So some may say that that's
my left brain doing its thing,

00:04:55.380 --> 00:04:58.140 align:middle line:84%
and that's the masculine
energy playing out.

00:04:58.140 --> 00:05:00.090 align:middle line:84%
And there's a lack
of intuition that's

00:05:00.090 --> 00:05:02.100 align:middle line:84%
true because that's
how I was raised.

00:05:02.100 --> 00:05:04.453 align:middle line:84%
I wasn't raised tapping
into something like that.

00:05:04.453 --> 00:05:06.120 align:middle line:84%
The reason why I'm
sharing that with you

00:05:06.120 --> 00:05:10.880 align:middle line:84%
is because when I stand
behind something, like TLS,

00:05:10.880 --> 00:05:14.270 align:middle line:84%
I want you guys to be very,
very sure and very certain

00:05:14.270 --> 00:05:17.810 align:middle line:84%
that I asked every possible
question under the sun.

00:05:17.810 --> 00:05:21.230 align:middle line:84%
I still ask every possible
question under the sun.

00:05:21.230 --> 00:05:24.080 align:middle line:84%
I don't stand behind
everything that I hear.

00:05:24.080 --> 00:05:27.440 align:middle line:84%
Because, at first, when I heard
this, I was even hesitant.

00:05:27.440 --> 00:05:29.740 align:middle line:90%
And I said, wait a second.

00:05:29.740 --> 00:05:32.920 align:middle line:84%
This sounds great,
but how do I know you

00:05:32.920 --> 00:05:34.660 align:middle line:90%
guys aren't bad playing as good?

00:05:34.660 --> 00:05:36.910 align:middle line:84%
Because I know that there
are a lot of negative things

00:05:36.910 --> 00:05:37.760 align:middle line:90%
out there.

00:05:37.760 --> 00:05:40.210 align:middle line:84%
How do I know that
all of this is legit?

00:05:40.210 --> 00:05:43.215 align:middle line:84%
How do I know that there are
people that can do X, Y, and Z?

00:05:43.215 --> 00:05:44.590 align:middle line:84%
And when I say X,
Y, and Z, we're

00:05:44.590 --> 00:05:47.560 align:middle line:84%
talking about supernatural
things, things

00:05:47.560 --> 00:05:50.410 align:middle line:84%
like telepathic communication,
telekinetic movement,

00:05:50.410 --> 00:05:51.910 align:middle line:84%
moving things without
touching them,

00:05:51.910 --> 00:05:54.520 align:middle line:84%
things like levitation, which
is basically manipulating

00:05:54.520 --> 00:05:57.820 align:middle line:84%
the force of gravity
through focusing

00:05:57.820 --> 00:05:59.455 align:middle line:84%
the energy in your
body, which is huge.

00:05:59.455 --> 00:06:02.140 align:middle line:84%
You have trillions of
volts in your body,

00:06:02.140 --> 00:06:05.210 align:middle line:84%
if you add up all the electrical
voltage and your cells.

00:06:05.210 --> 00:06:08.020 align:middle line:84%
And if you just so happen to
know how to focus that energy,

00:06:08.020 --> 00:06:10.060 align:middle line:84%
you could touch somebody
and electrocute them.

00:06:10.060 --> 00:06:12.070 align:middle line:90%
You can power an entire city.

00:06:12.070 --> 00:06:14.170 align:middle line:84%
You can do things
like levitation.

00:06:14.170 --> 00:06:17.440 align:middle line:84%
It becomes very real
when you ground things.

00:06:17.440 --> 00:06:19.510 align:middle line:84%
So everything I'm
going to bring today,

00:06:19.510 --> 00:06:22.743 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to do my best to bring
from a grounded perspective.

00:06:22.743 --> 00:06:24.160 align:middle line:84%
I don't just want
to say something

00:06:24.160 --> 00:06:26.560 align:middle line:84%
without bringing a base,
so we can understand

00:06:26.560 --> 00:06:28.930 align:middle line:84%
how did we get there, as
opposed to just saying, well,

00:06:28.930 --> 00:06:30.080 align:middle line:90%
Jason said it.

00:06:30.080 --> 00:06:32.270 align:middle line:90%
That's not a good answer.

00:06:32.270 --> 00:06:34.490 align:middle line:84%
If somebody asks you
something, well, Jason

00:06:34.490 --> 00:06:35.810 align:middle line:90%
said it is not going to cut it.

00:06:35.810 --> 00:06:37.520 align:middle line:84%
Because when somebody
asks me something,

00:06:37.520 --> 00:06:39.590 align:middle line:84%
and I ever thought of saying,
well, this person said it,

00:06:39.590 --> 00:06:41.010 align:middle line:90%
that was never a good answer.

00:06:41.010 --> 00:06:42.980 align:middle line:90%
And I understand that.

00:06:42.980 --> 00:06:45.230 align:middle line:84%
So I'm going to bring you
guys through that process

00:06:45.230 --> 00:06:48.230 align:middle line:84%
and that logic in a grounded
way to understand all of this,

00:06:48.230 --> 00:06:50.150 align:middle line:84%
so you guys can really
walk out of this room

00:06:50.150 --> 00:06:52.430 align:middle line:84%
today with ammunition--
ammunition,

00:06:52.430 --> 00:06:55.760 align:middle line:84%
a.k.a., awareness, knowledge,
information, turning

00:06:55.760 --> 00:06:57.420 align:middle line:84%
that information
to pure awareness,

00:06:57.420 --> 00:06:58.605 align:middle line:90%
so we can free ourselves.

00:06:58.605 --> 00:07:00.980 align:middle line:84%
Because, ultimately, the world
that we live in right now,

00:07:00.980 --> 00:07:03.320 align:middle line:84%
the dark side of it,
especially is not something

00:07:03.320 --> 00:07:04.760 align:middle line:90%
that exists outside of us.

00:07:04.760 --> 00:07:06.860 align:middle line:84%
The dark side of the
world is a reflection

00:07:06.860 --> 00:07:08.540 align:middle line:90%
of the dark side within us.

00:07:08.540 --> 00:07:10.910 align:middle line:84%
And the work that
we have to do, sure,

00:07:10.910 --> 00:07:12.950 align:middle line:84%
is there a part
of it that says we

00:07:12.950 --> 00:07:17.630 align:middle line:84%
need to do X, Y, and Z outside
in physical reality, absolutely.

00:07:17.630 --> 00:07:22.340 align:middle line:84%
But the most important key to
truly living a liberated life

00:07:22.340 --> 00:07:25.010 align:middle line:84%
and a liberated world
with intergalactic unity

00:07:25.010 --> 00:07:27.860 align:middle line:84%
which we're going to get to
later in this presentation

00:07:27.860 --> 00:07:29.480 align:middle line:90%
is freedom from within.

00:07:29.480 --> 00:07:32.180 align:middle line:84%
Because everything is a
reflection of just that.

00:07:32.180 --> 00:07:34.480 align:middle line:10%
So TLS, what are they?

00:07:34.480 --> 00:07:36.400 align:middle line:84%
Just like there are
organizations out there--

00:07:36.400 --> 00:07:39.490 align:middle line:84%
and I'm not comparing them, so
please don't take this that way.

00:07:39.490 --> 00:07:41.110 align:middle line:84%
But there are
organizations out there,

00:07:41.110 --> 00:07:45.310 align:middle line:84%
like the CIA, like the
FBI, like the Mossad.

00:07:45.310 --> 00:07:49.000 align:middle line:84%
I would say that most of those
organizations from the top

00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:51.130 align:middle line:84%
are generally corrupt
organizations.

00:07:51.130 --> 00:07:53.800 align:middle line:84%
Does that mean that every
individual that works

00:07:53.800 --> 00:07:55.300 align:middle line:90%
in those organizations are bad?

00:07:55.300 --> 00:07:57.340 align:middle line:84%
No, it's not as black
and white as that.

00:07:57.340 --> 00:08:00.160 align:middle line:84%
There are a lot of good
people with great intentions

00:08:00.160 --> 00:08:02.500 align:middle line:84%
that have wanted to join
something like the CIA

00:08:02.500 --> 00:08:03.940 align:middle line:84%
and then eventually
probably left.

00:08:03.940 --> 00:08:05.315 align:middle line:84%
I work with some
of those people.

00:08:05.315 --> 00:08:07.538 align:middle line:84%
They left because they saw
a lot of different things

00:08:07.538 --> 00:08:08.830 align:middle line:90%
that I'm not going to get into.

00:08:08.830 --> 00:08:11.290 align:middle line:84%
And they said, this is not
what I want to stand for,

00:08:11.290 --> 00:08:13.630 align:middle line:84%
but they came from the right
intention, so they left.

00:08:13.630 --> 00:08:16.660 align:middle line:84%
Some of those people
work with TLS today.

00:08:16.660 --> 00:08:21.250 align:middle line:84%
TLS is an organization that has
one very specific intention,

00:08:21.250 --> 00:08:23.710 align:middle line:84%
and I'm going to
simplify that intention.

00:08:23.710 --> 00:08:27.190 align:middle line:84%
How do we awaken
humanity and catalyze

00:08:27.190 --> 00:08:29.770 align:middle line:84%
the process of raising
the collective awareness

00:08:29.770 --> 00:08:30.990 align:middle line:90%
around the world?

00:08:30.990 --> 00:08:32.549 align:middle line:90%
Why is that important?

00:08:32.549 --> 00:08:34.950 align:middle line:84%
It's not about going and
taking out the evil people

00:08:34.950 --> 00:08:35.750 align:middle line:90%
in the world.

00:08:35.750 --> 00:08:37.470 align:middle line:90%
Because can they do that?

00:08:37.470 --> 00:08:38.270 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:08:38.270 --> 00:08:40.950 align:middle line:84%
If they do that, will it
solve something today?

00:08:40.950 --> 00:08:41.750 align:middle line:90%
Sure.

00:08:41.750 --> 00:08:44.030 align:middle line:84%
Will that person be
replaced tomorrow?

00:08:44.030 --> 00:08:44.840 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:08:44.840 --> 00:08:47.930 align:middle line:84%
The root of the issue
is not the evil person

00:08:47.930 --> 00:08:50.450 align:middle line:84%
or the evil organization
or the evil agency

00:08:50.450 --> 00:08:51.890 align:middle line:90%
or the evil corporation.

00:08:51.890 --> 00:08:54.260 align:middle line:84%
The root of the problem
is we the people

00:08:54.260 --> 00:08:56.610 align:middle line:84%
that have that as a
reflection of ourselves,

00:08:56.610 --> 00:09:00.132 align:middle line:84%
meaning their key of what they
try to do first and foremost--

00:09:00.132 --> 00:09:02.090 align:middle line:84%
and they do this through
many different avenues

00:09:02.090 --> 00:09:03.350 align:middle line:90%
that I'm going to share today.

00:09:03.350 --> 00:09:06.110 align:middle line:84%
Their key of what they
do, first and foremost,

00:09:06.110 --> 00:09:09.050 align:middle line:84%
is how do we raise the
collective level of awareness

00:09:09.050 --> 00:09:13.010 align:middle line:84%
for humanity as a whole without
interfering with the free will

00:09:13.010 --> 00:09:14.040 align:middle line:90%
of humankind.

00:09:14.040 --> 00:09:16.490 align:middle line:90%
That's a very fine line.

00:09:16.490 --> 00:09:19.280 align:middle line:84%
Because if they were to
come and do things for us,

00:09:19.280 --> 00:09:21.590 align:middle line:84%
I would argue that that's
a crime against humanity.

00:09:21.590 --> 00:09:24.080 align:middle line:84%
It's almost like
saying you have a kid,

00:09:24.080 --> 00:09:26.540 align:middle line:90%
and your kid is touching fire.

00:09:26.540 --> 00:09:28.950 align:middle line:84%
And every single time your
kid touches that fire,

00:09:28.950 --> 00:09:29.750 align:middle line:90%
you have a button.

00:09:29.750 --> 00:09:32.450 align:middle line:84%
And you press the button
to make your kid's finger

00:09:32.450 --> 00:09:34.310 align:middle line:84%
numb every time he
touches the fire.

00:09:34.310 --> 00:09:36.283 align:middle line:84%
While you're doing that
may be out of love,

00:09:36.283 --> 00:09:38.450 align:middle line:84%
but you're lacking the
awareness that your kid needs

00:09:38.450 --> 00:09:41.420 align:middle line:84%
to feel the heat of that fire to
make sure that your kid doesn't

00:09:41.420 --> 00:09:42.740 align:middle line:90%
touch that fire again.

00:09:42.740 --> 00:09:44.690 align:middle line:84%
Because if you keep
numbing and you

00:09:44.690 --> 00:09:48.330 align:middle line:84%
keep stopping that pain,
what happens is your kid

00:09:48.330 --> 00:09:49.320 align:middle line:90%
may not feel it.

00:09:49.320 --> 00:09:52.230 align:middle line:84%
But the finger will burn,
and infection will grow.

00:09:52.230 --> 00:09:55.540 align:middle line:84%
It will spread throughout the
body, and your kid will die.

00:09:55.540 --> 00:09:58.080 align:middle line:84%
So anybody that would ever
go and do something like that

00:09:58.080 --> 00:10:01.365 align:middle line:84%
from a higher level is not
actually at a higher level.

00:10:01.365 --> 00:10:03.270 align:middle line:90%
This is how we use discernment.

00:10:03.270 --> 00:10:06.430 align:middle line:84%
Are there times and places
where they can go and interfere?

00:10:06.430 --> 00:10:07.230 align:middle line:90%
Sure.

00:10:07.230 --> 00:10:10.170 align:middle line:84%
But there is a fine
line behind not

00:10:10.170 --> 00:10:13.860 align:middle line:84%
interfering with the destiny
of humankind for the most part.

00:10:13.860 --> 00:10:17.040 align:middle line:84%
There's a fine line without
taking away our free will,

00:10:17.040 --> 00:10:20.640 align:middle line:84%
without taking away our
experiences that help us grow

00:10:20.640 --> 00:10:22.480 align:middle line:90%
and move on to our next level.

00:10:22.480 --> 00:10:25.260 align:middle line:84%
And I think most of us in
this room probably know this.

00:10:25.260 --> 00:10:27.390 align:middle line:10%
It's the hardest
times in our lives,

00:10:27.390 --> 00:10:30.630 align:middle line:10%
where we see who we truly
are and where we truly are

00:10:30.630 --> 00:10:32.837 align:middle line:10%
and what we truly are
made of, and the lessons

00:10:32.837 --> 00:10:34.920 align:middle line:10%
that we have to learn come
throughout those times,

00:10:34.920 --> 00:10:36.810 align:middle line:10%
not through when
you're smooth sailing.

00:10:36.810 --> 00:10:39.520 align:middle line:84%
So it's not about
taking those times away.

00:10:39.520 --> 00:10:42.210 align:middle line:84%
It's about helping us
move through those times

00:10:42.210 --> 00:10:45.390 align:middle line:84%
in a guided way to learn
the lessons quicker,

00:10:45.390 --> 00:10:48.160 align:middle line:84%
to go through that
process in an easier way.

00:10:48.160 --> 00:10:49.070 align:middle line:90%
Will there be pain?

00:10:49.070 --> 00:10:49.870 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:10:49.870 --> 00:10:51.040 align:middle line:90%
Will there be death?

00:10:51.040 --> 00:10:51.850 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:10:51.850 --> 00:10:54.500 align:middle line:84%
Will there be reincarnation
of those people coming back?

00:10:54.500 --> 00:10:55.300 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:10:55.300 --> 00:10:57.590 align:middle line:84%
That's what happens from
a higher perspective.

00:10:57.590 --> 00:11:00.550 align:middle line:84%
So it's this understanding
from a zoomed out perspective

00:11:00.550 --> 00:11:02.560 align:middle line:84%
of allowing people
to experience what

00:11:02.560 --> 00:11:04.600 align:middle line:84%
they need to experience
while mitigating

00:11:04.600 --> 00:11:05.770 align:middle line:90%
the damage along the way.

00:11:05.770 --> 00:11:09.990 align:middle line:84%
The fine line is not taking away
the free will from human beings.

00:11:09.990 --> 00:11:13.120 align:middle line:84%
The organization is made up
of about 8,500 individuals

00:11:13.120 --> 00:11:14.120 align:middle line:90%
around the world.

00:11:14.120 --> 00:11:16.960 align:middle line:84%
Some of those individuals,
all of you in this room know.

00:11:16.960 --> 00:11:18.560 align:middle line:84%
They will never
come out and say,

00:11:18.560 --> 00:11:19.930 align:middle line:90%
I work with the organization.

00:11:19.930 --> 00:11:21.370 align:middle line:90%
That's a good thing.

00:11:21.370 --> 00:11:24.190 align:middle line:84%
Because if-- and this
is the beautiful part

00:11:24.190 --> 00:11:26.290 align:middle line:84%
that I see about
the organization.

00:11:26.290 --> 00:11:28.280 align:middle line:84%
Now it comes to using
discernment and critical

00:11:28.280 --> 00:11:29.080 align:middle line:90%
thought.

00:11:29.080 --> 00:11:33.050 align:middle line:84%
If there was the ability for a
human being to come out and say,

00:11:33.050 --> 00:11:34.295 align:middle line:90%
I'm a part of this I do this.

00:11:34.295 --> 00:11:36.670 align:middle line:84%
And I'll talk about myself in
just a second because there

00:11:36.670 --> 00:11:37.900 align:middle line:90%
can be a contradiction there.

00:11:37.900 --> 00:11:41.690 align:middle line:84%
But I'm a part of this, and I do
this, and so on, and so forth,

00:11:41.690 --> 00:11:43.150 align:middle line:90%
there's ego involved in there.

00:11:43.150 --> 00:11:46.810 align:middle line:84%
What do these individuals have
to gain from doing everything

00:11:46.810 --> 00:11:49.420 align:middle line:84%
anonymously or from
risking their lives,

00:11:49.420 --> 00:11:51.730 align:middle line:84%
from doing everything
from a good place

00:11:51.730 --> 00:11:54.100 align:middle line:84%
because they have nothing
to gain only to lose?

00:11:54.100 --> 00:11:55.270 align:middle line:90%
There are risks involved.

00:11:55.270 --> 00:11:59.230 align:middle line:84%
And as a matter of
fact, in 2020 and 2021,

00:11:59.230 --> 00:12:03.040 align:middle line:84%
the organization was made up
of 7,000 initiated agents,

00:12:03.040 --> 00:12:04.900 align:middle line:90%
and 2,000 of them died.

00:12:04.900 --> 00:12:08.440 align:middle line:10%
2,000 of them died because they
were operations throughout 2020

00:12:08.440 --> 00:12:11.230 align:middle line:10%
and 2021 that many of you
have probably heard of,

00:12:11.230 --> 00:12:13.140 align:middle line:10%
having to do with
underground tunnel systems,

00:12:13.140 --> 00:12:15.640 align:middle line:10%
having to do with clearing those
underground tunnel systems,

00:12:15.640 --> 00:12:18.010 align:middle line:10%
having to do with children,
certain things that

00:12:18.010 --> 00:12:20.440 align:middle line:10%
are going down there, which
we'll talk about as well.

00:12:20.440 --> 00:12:22.480 align:middle line:84%
Those are very
dangerous operations.

00:12:22.480 --> 00:12:24.140 align:middle line:84%
I'm not a part of
those operations.

00:12:24.140 --> 00:12:25.000 align:middle line:90%
That's not my lane.

00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:26.270 align:middle line:90%
It's not what I do.

00:12:26.270 --> 00:12:28.787 align:middle line:84%
I was brought on to the
organization a very unique way,

00:12:28.787 --> 00:12:30.370 align:middle line:84%
which I'll tell you
about in a second.

00:12:30.370 --> 00:12:33.770 align:middle line:84%
And by the way, I'm not formally
initiated into the organization,

00:12:33.770 --> 00:12:35.600 align:middle line:84%
so I can't say that
I'm a part of it.

00:12:35.600 --> 00:12:38.590 align:middle line:84%
But they did basically ask
me and what I evolved into

00:12:38.590 --> 00:12:41.680 align:middle line:84%
is a spokesperson, to be a
vehicle, to be a soldier,

00:12:41.680 --> 00:12:45.130 align:middle line:84%
to be an asset for them, to
help them fulfill that mission.

00:12:45.130 --> 00:12:47.950 align:middle line:84%
The most important thing
over here that I always

00:12:47.950 --> 00:12:50.740 align:middle line:84%
have to remind everybody
is to make sure

00:12:50.740 --> 00:12:53.650 align:middle line:84%
that nobody outsources their
power because TLS is not here

00:12:53.650 --> 00:12:54.850 align:middle line:90%
to save you.

00:12:54.850 --> 00:12:57.260 align:middle line:84%
TLS cannot save you,
as a matter of fact.

00:12:57.260 --> 00:12:58.660 align:middle line:90%
Nobody can save you.

00:12:58.660 --> 00:13:02.175 align:middle line:84%
The only person that can
save you is you, yourself.

00:13:02.175 --> 00:13:03.550 align:middle line:84%
The only person
that can save you

00:13:03.550 --> 00:13:05.290 align:middle line:84%
is you with the
awareness necessary.

00:13:05.290 --> 00:13:07.390 align:middle line:84%
Some call it Christ
consciousness.

00:13:07.390 --> 00:13:09.075 align:middle line:90%
Some call it God consciousness.

00:13:09.075 --> 00:13:11.200 align:middle line:84%
Although, I don't like
using that word because it's

00:13:11.200 --> 00:13:12.070 align:middle line:90%
been corrupted.

00:13:12.070 --> 00:13:13.923 align:middle line:84%
Some call it divine
consciousness.

00:13:13.923 --> 00:13:15.340 align:middle line:84%
Whatever you want
to call it, it's

00:13:15.340 --> 00:13:18.220 align:middle line:84%
about reaching that
newfound awareness in order

00:13:18.220 --> 00:13:20.980 align:middle line:84%
to get to a point, once
again, where we can be free

00:13:20.980 --> 00:13:22.240 align:middle line:90%
from within.

00:13:22.240 --> 00:13:24.460 align:middle line:84%
So the organization
today is made up

00:13:24.460 --> 00:13:26.710 align:middle line:90%
of about 8,500 individuals.

00:13:26.710 --> 00:13:29.590 align:middle line:84%
They've recruited a lot over
the past couple of years because

00:13:29.590 --> 00:13:32.410 align:middle line:90%
of what happened in 2020, 2021.

00:13:32.410 --> 00:13:35.350 align:middle line:84%
They operate in
every single sector,

00:13:35.350 --> 00:13:37.150 align:middle line:84%
and I still don't
know how it's done.

00:13:37.150 --> 00:13:39.290 align:middle line:84%
Everywhere, from
beginning to end,

00:13:39.290 --> 00:13:42.410 align:middle line:84%
they have some sort of influence
or finger to move there.

00:13:42.410 --> 00:13:46.270 align:middle line:84%
So let's talk about the US
and beyond, the Pentagon.

00:13:46.270 --> 00:13:52.480 align:middle line:84%
The White House, NASA, the
CIA, the FBI, the Mossad, MI6,

00:13:52.480 --> 00:13:54.760 align:middle line:84%
all of these things
they are a part of it.

00:13:54.760 --> 00:13:57.790 align:middle line:84%
They have a piece of, but
they are not part of them.

00:13:57.790 --> 00:14:00.940 align:middle line:84%
They use their people to
infiltrate them because how

00:14:00.940 --> 00:14:02.450 align:middle line:90%
do you beat a monster.

00:14:02.450 --> 00:14:04.250 align:middle line:84%
You can try to fight
it from outside,

00:14:04.250 --> 00:14:06.650 align:middle line:84%
but it's easiest to beat
a monster from within.

00:14:06.650 --> 00:14:08.900 align:middle line:84%
So just like other
organizations have individuals

00:14:08.900 --> 00:14:12.290 align:middle line:84%
that go and play doubles and
receive intelligence and bring

00:14:12.290 --> 00:14:14.460 align:middle line:90%
it back, TLS is no different.

00:14:14.460 --> 00:14:17.780 align:middle line:84%
The difference is the intentions
of why they're doing it.

00:14:17.780 --> 00:14:20.160 align:middle line:84%
So they're
self-serving purposes,

00:14:20.160 --> 00:14:23.345 align:middle line:84%
and there's serving
to other purposes.

00:14:23.345 --> 00:14:26.210 align:middle line:84%
TLS and many other
organizations that I'm not

00:14:26.210 --> 00:14:28.610 align:middle line:84%
a part of or affiliated
with do that.

00:14:28.610 --> 00:14:30.240 align:middle line:90%
TLS is not the only one.

00:14:30.240 --> 00:14:34.580 align:middle line:84%
So every avenue,
anywhere from politics

00:14:34.580 --> 00:14:37.610 align:middle line:84%
to the medical
industry, to media,

00:14:37.610 --> 00:14:40.997 align:middle line:84%
to the news that they can
influence and get things

00:14:40.997 --> 00:14:42.080 align:middle line:90%
to happen in certain ways.

00:14:42.080 --> 00:14:45.200 align:middle line:84%
They have a finger in
every single place in order

00:14:45.200 --> 00:14:47.473 align:middle line:84%
to make things
move subliminally.

00:14:47.473 --> 00:14:49.640 align:middle line:84%
Because they can't just
come and be like, hey, guys,

00:14:49.640 --> 00:14:50.510 align:middle line:90%
this is who we are.

00:14:50.510 --> 00:14:52.718 align:middle line:84%
This is why we're here, and
this is what we're doing.

00:14:52.718 --> 00:14:54.418 align:middle line:84%
It takes away the
human experience

00:14:54.418 --> 00:14:55.460 align:middle line:90%
of what we're here to do.

00:14:55.460 --> 00:14:57.200 align:middle line:84%
It would go against
their mission.

00:14:57.200 --> 00:14:59.960 align:middle line:10%
It would go against the
spiritual understanding

00:14:59.960 --> 00:15:04.050 align:middle line:10%
of not interfering with the free
will of humanity as we know it.

00:15:04.050 --> 00:15:06.645 align:middle line:84%
So in short, the
organization has chapters

00:15:06.645 --> 00:15:07.520 align:middle line:90%
all around the world.

00:15:07.520 --> 00:15:08.990 align:middle line:90%
They call them chapters.

00:15:08.990 --> 00:15:10.800 align:middle line:84%
The New York
chapter, for example,

00:15:10.800 --> 00:15:13.160 align:middle line:84%
is made up of about 900
to 1,000 individuals.

00:15:13.160 --> 00:15:14.780 align:middle line:84%
That's one of the
bigger chapters.

00:15:14.780 --> 00:15:17.100 align:middle line:84%
They have chapters in every
major city in the world.

00:15:17.100 --> 00:15:19.233 align:middle line:90%
This is a physical organization.

00:15:19.233 --> 00:15:21.650 align:middle line:84%
There are people that hear me
sometimes, and they're like,

00:15:21.650 --> 00:15:23.630 align:middle line:84%
you work with the Galactic
Federation of Light.

00:15:23.630 --> 00:15:25.578 align:middle line:90%
No, I'm also not knocking that.

00:15:25.578 --> 00:15:27.120 align:middle line:84%
But I don't know
anything about that,

00:15:27.120 --> 00:15:28.550 align:middle line:84%
so I don't want to
talk about that.

00:15:28.550 --> 00:15:30.675 align:middle line:84%
I know that there are a
lot of people that do that.

00:15:30.675 --> 00:15:31.670 align:middle line:90%
TLS is not that.

00:15:31.670 --> 00:15:33.830 align:middle line:90%
TLS is a physical organization.

00:15:33.830 --> 00:15:36.920 align:middle line:84%
They do work, if you want to
call it, inter-dimensionally.

00:15:36.920 --> 00:15:39.510 align:middle line:84%
We could get into that in
the Q&A if we have time.

00:15:39.510 --> 00:15:42.140 align:middle line:84%
But the people that I work
with are physical people

00:15:42.140 --> 00:15:44.690 align:middle line:84%
that I can call, that I can
text, that I can go to a meeting

00:15:44.690 --> 00:15:46.010 align:middle line:90%
with, that I can sit down.

00:15:46.010 --> 00:15:48.410 align:middle line:84%
There are human beings, as
far as I know, at least.

00:15:48.410 --> 00:15:50.750 align:middle line:84%
There are human
beings, and there

00:15:50.750 --> 00:15:52.580 align:middle line:84%
are people with
families that were born,

00:15:52.580 --> 00:15:53.913 align:middle line:90%
that have a mother and a father.

00:15:53.913 --> 00:15:56.390 align:middle line:84%
They're normal people
that some of them

00:15:56.390 --> 00:15:58.850 align:middle line:84%
are brought in for
spiritual purposes

00:15:58.850 --> 00:16:00.752 align:middle line:84%
because they have
certain capabilities

00:16:00.752 --> 00:16:02.960 align:middle line:84%
that the organization would
bring them in and recruit

00:16:02.960 --> 00:16:06.710 align:middle line:84%
them to help develop in order
to use for certain purposes.

00:16:06.710 --> 00:16:09.320 align:middle line:84%
Other people are brought in
because of their expertise.

00:16:09.320 --> 00:16:14.270 align:middle line:84%
So for example, their units in
the military of expert hackers.

00:16:14.270 --> 00:16:16.880 align:middle line:84%
In the IDF, there's
a unit called 8,200.

00:16:16.880 --> 00:16:19.460 align:middle line:84%
Unit 8,200 is known
as one of the best

00:16:19.460 --> 00:16:22.970 align:middle line:84%
units when it comes to the
nerds of the world, the hackers.

00:16:22.970 --> 00:16:25.340 align:middle line:84%
They can turn red
lights into green lights

00:16:25.340 --> 00:16:27.380 align:middle line:84%
to get you across the
city a whole lot quicker.

00:16:27.380 --> 00:16:29.420 align:middle line:84%
I know of an operation that
they've done that with people

00:16:29.420 --> 00:16:30.350 align:middle line:90%
that I work with.

00:16:30.350 --> 00:16:33.110 align:middle line:84%
They can hack and turn and
do whatever needs done.

00:16:33.110 --> 00:16:36.110 align:middle line:84%
So TLS would bring those
people on and recruit them.

00:16:36.110 --> 00:16:38.360 align:middle line:84%
Just like IBM or Facebook
would recruit them.

00:16:38.360 --> 00:16:40.550 align:middle line:84%
Only TLS would recruit
them for their purposes

00:16:40.550 --> 00:16:43.190 align:middle line:84%
because they've already
developed their expertise.

00:16:43.190 --> 00:16:46.203 align:middle line:84%
So there is a spiritual
side of the organization

00:16:46.203 --> 00:16:47.120 align:middle line:90%
that's still physical.

00:16:47.120 --> 00:16:49.095 align:middle line:90%
But it's for spiritual purposes.

00:16:49.095 --> 00:16:50.720 align:middle line:84%
Those are the people
that can do things

00:16:50.720 --> 00:16:53.450 align:middle line:84%
like levitation and
influence and move

00:16:53.450 --> 00:16:56.367 align:middle line:84%
certain things and incredible
things that we can't get into.

00:16:56.367 --> 00:16:58.700 align:middle line:84%
And then there's the other
side of the organization that

00:16:58.700 --> 00:17:01.460 align:middle line:84%
are more foot soldiers, that
are individuals that are here

00:17:01.460 --> 00:17:05.192 align:middle line:84%
for physical purposes, like
politicians that are working

00:17:05.192 --> 00:17:06.109 align:middle line:90%
with the organization.

00:17:06.109 --> 00:17:08.359 align:middle line:84%
But they're using the
politicians in order

00:17:08.359 --> 00:17:10.339 align:middle line:84%
to move certain things,
in order to make

00:17:10.339 --> 00:17:13.710 align:middle line:84%
certain things happen or stop
certain things from happening.

00:17:13.710 --> 00:17:16.575 align:middle line:84%
And those are the two
sides of that organization.

00:17:16.575 --> 00:17:18.450 align:middle line:84%
I'm just trying to find
my clicker over here.

00:17:18.450 --> 00:17:21.368 align:middle line:84%
So that's the big picture of
the organization, how they work.

00:17:21.368 --> 00:17:23.660 align:middle line:84%
Again, I'm sure there's going
to be a lot of questions,

00:17:23.660 --> 00:17:25.040 align:middle line:90%
so we'll dive into that.

00:17:25.040 --> 00:17:27.710 align:middle line:84%
Right now, I want to tell
you guys a story of how

00:17:27.710 --> 00:17:28.943 align:middle line:90%
this whole thing happened.

00:17:28.943 --> 00:17:30.860 align:middle line:84%
And then we're going to
go into the disclosure

00:17:30.860 --> 00:17:33.027 align:middle line:84%
aspect of this whole thing
because it's very unique,

00:17:33.027 --> 00:17:35.150 align:middle line:90%
and it's very interesting.

00:17:35.150 --> 00:17:38.630 align:middle line:84%
June 2018 is when it
started in my life.

00:17:38.630 --> 00:17:39.920 align:middle line:90%
I was 20 years old.

00:17:39.920 --> 00:17:42.290 align:middle line:84%
It was two weeks before
my 21st birthday.

00:17:42.290 --> 00:17:43.730 align:middle line:90%
Today, I'm 26.

00:17:43.730 --> 00:17:45.110 align:middle line:90%
My birthday is June 26.

00:17:45.110 --> 00:17:47.930 align:middle line:84%
So this happened
around June 7, 8, 9.

00:17:47.930 --> 00:17:49.370 align:middle line:90%
I don't remember the exact day.

00:17:49.370 --> 00:17:52.010 align:middle line:84%
I used to live in New
York City, normal.

00:17:52.010 --> 00:17:53.810 align:middle line:90%
I was working for my father.

00:17:53.810 --> 00:17:56.480 align:middle line:84%
I was working for their business
in commercial real estate.

00:17:56.480 --> 00:18:01.780 align:middle line:84%
I was about I think three years
into doing that whole thing.

00:18:01.780 --> 00:18:04.200 align:middle line:84%
And one day, somebody
approaches me on the street.

00:18:04.200 --> 00:18:07.230 align:middle line:84%
Just like anybody would approach
you, starts a conversation.

00:18:07.230 --> 00:18:08.940 align:middle line:84%
I thought that it
was a stranger.

00:18:08.940 --> 00:18:09.900 align:middle line:90%
It was not a stranger.

00:18:09.900 --> 00:18:11.230 align:middle line:90%
I found that out later.

00:18:11.230 --> 00:18:12.970 align:middle line:84%
But I didn't know
that at the time.

00:18:12.970 --> 00:18:15.330 align:middle line:84%
So somebody approaches
me, starts a conversation,

00:18:15.330 --> 00:18:16.620 align:middle line:90%
very unique man.

00:18:16.620 --> 00:18:18.690 align:middle line:90%
We start conversing.

00:18:18.690 --> 00:18:21.030 align:middle line:84%
We exchange numbers,
and we keep in touch.

00:18:21.030 --> 00:18:23.640 align:middle line:84%
And he starts speaking
about all the things

00:18:23.640 --> 00:18:25.440 align:middle line:90%
that I loved when I was a kid--

00:18:25.440 --> 00:18:29.592 align:middle line:84%
extraterrestrial life, the
pyramids, Ancient Egypt.

00:18:29.592 --> 00:18:31.800 align:middle line:84%
And I'm like, where the hell
is this guy coming from?

00:18:31.800 --> 00:18:33.570 align:middle line:84%
Now, mind you, this
man is a businessman.

00:18:33.570 --> 00:18:36.810 align:middle line:84%
This is not like a woo
woo spiritual man that you

00:18:36.810 --> 00:18:38.700 align:middle line:90%
would think knows those things.

00:18:38.700 --> 00:18:39.990 align:middle line:90%
The man in a suit.

00:18:39.990 --> 00:18:42.820 align:middle line:84%
A man that's like an
executive man in the world.

00:18:42.820 --> 00:18:44.580 align:middle line:84%
So I'm looking at,
and it intrigued me.

00:18:44.580 --> 00:18:46.590 align:middle line:84%
And I didn't understand
what was going on

00:18:46.590 --> 00:18:49.320 align:middle line:84%
and what he wanted from
me, but it intrigued me.

00:18:49.320 --> 00:18:50.680 align:middle line:90%
It was entertaining.

00:18:50.680 --> 00:18:51.980 align:middle line:90%
It was fascinating.

00:18:51.980 --> 00:18:53.730 align:middle line:84%
And I said, let's hear
what he has to say.

00:18:53.730 --> 00:18:55.300 align:middle line:90%
So we met up every so often.

00:18:55.300 --> 00:18:56.100 align:middle line:90%
We had lunch.

00:18:56.100 --> 00:18:58.390 align:middle line:84%
And he told me about all
these different things

00:18:58.390 --> 00:19:02.290 align:middle line:84%
and made me think, helping me
develop what I was already into,

00:19:02.290 --> 00:19:06.060 align:middle line:84%
growing up, but I never
really told anybody.

00:19:06.060 --> 00:19:07.920 align:middle line:90%
Fast forward two years.

00:19:07.920 --> 00:19:09.900 align:middle line:90%
He basically tells me--

00:19:09.900 --> 00:19:12.840 align:middle line:84%
this was after a major
rapport was built

00:19:12.840 --> 00:19:14.070 align:middle line:90%
and a connection was built.

00:19:14.070 --> 00:19:15.160 align:middle line:90%
And I trusted the man.

00:19:15.160 --> 00:19:17.130 align:middle line:84%
I had experiences with
the man, and we could

00:19:17.130 --> 00:19:18.390 align:middle line:90%
talk about those experiences.

00:19:18.390 --> 00:19:21.760 align:middle line:84%
But there came a
point where he said,

00:19:21.760 --> 00:19:24.170 align:middle line:90%
I work with an organization.

00:19:24.170 --> 00:19:26.030 align:middle line:90%
I want you to come to a meeting.

00:19:26.030 --> 00:19:30.770 align:middle line:84%
February 6, 2020, meet me
over here at this time.

00:19:30.770 --> 00:19:33.320 align:middle line:84%
Don't make plans for
the rest of the evening

00:19:33.320 --> 00:19:36.000 align:middle line:90%
and don't ask questions.

00:19:36.000 --> 00:19:37.887 align:middle line:90%
OK, let's do it.

00:19:37.887 --> 00:19:38.970 align:middle line:90%
I couldn't tell my family.

00:19:38.970 --> 00:19:40.420 align:middle line:90%
They would think I'm crazy.

00:19:40.420 --> 00:19:41.837 align:middle line:90%
So I'm like, OK, let's do it.

00:19:41.837 --> 00:19:43.170 align:middle line:90%
So I told everybody I got to go.

00:19:43.170 --> 00:19:44.753 align:middle line:84%
They probably thought
that I was going

00:19:44.753 --> 00:19:47.170 align:middle line:84%
to see somebody or go out with
friends or whatever it was.

00:19:47.170 --> 00:19:48.182 align:middle line:90%
And I kept it like that.

00:19:48.182 --> 00:19:49.140 align:middle line:90%
I went to this meeting.

00:19:49.140 --> 00:19:52.170 align:middle line:90%
This meeting lasted 12 hours--

00:19:52.170 --> 00:19:54.480 align:middle line:90%
lasted the entire night.

00:19:54.480 --> 00:19:56.850 align:middle line:84%
There were few individuals
in that meeting.

00:19:56.850 --> 00:20:00.850 align:middle line:84%
And throughout these 12 hours
is when you can say my life

00:20:00.850 --> 00:20:01.650 align:middle line:90%
changed.

00:20:01.650 --> 00:20:04.470 align:middle line:84%
It's when everything
just turned.

00:20:04.470 --> 00:20:05.980 align:middle line:90%
And I didn't know what to do.

00:20:05.980 --> 00:20:08.280 align:middle line:84%
It was very overwhelming
for me because

00:20:08.280 --> 00:20:10.810 align:middle line:84%
of what was shared with me in
that meeting, what was shown

00:20:10.810 --> 00:20:12.060 align:middle line:90%
to me throughout that meeting.

00:20:12.060 --> 00:20:13.408 align:middle line:90%
There was a lot of information.

00:20:13.408 --> 00:20:14.700 align:middle line:90%
I can't share all of that here.

00:20:14.700 --> 00:20:15.900 align:middle line:90%
We don't have that much time.

00:20:15.900 --> 00:20:17.317 align:middle line:84%
But there was a
lot of information

00:20:17.317 --> 00:20:18.690 align:middle line:90%
shared throughout that meeting.

00:20:18.690 --> 00:20:24.060 align:middle line:84%
And that's my first time that
I ever heard the word TLS.

00:20:24.060 --> 00:20:26.280 align:middle line:84%
So I hear them saying
TLS, The Light System.

00:20:26.280 --> 00:20:27.300 align:middle line:90%
I'm like, what's that?

00:20:27.300 --> 00:20:29.130 align:middle line:84%
They're like, now one
of the instructions

00:20:29.130 --> 00:20:31.110 align:middle line:84%
in the beginning
of the meeting was

00:20:31.110 --> 00:20:35.260 align:middle line:84%
there is no talking, unless
you're asked and given

00:20:35.260 --> 00:20:37.210 align:middle line:90%
permission to ask a question.

00:20:37.210 --> 00:20:39.250 align:middle line:84%
But me and a few other
people on one side

00:20:39.250 --> 00:20:42.790 align:middle line:84%
of the table all had notepads--
still have that notepad.

00:20:42.790 --> 00:20:44.920 align:middle line:84%
And I have all the
notes that I took down.

00:20:44.920 --> 00:20:46.210 align:middle line:90%
We all have our notes.

00:20:46.210 --> 00:20:49.520 align:middle line:84%
And I wrote and wrote and
wrote pages of notes, 12 hours.

00:20:49.520 --> 00:20:51.580 align:middle line:84%
And it's like-- it's almost
like you were brought

00:20:51.580 --> 00:20:54.710 align:middle line:84%
into a trance of like
meditation in a way,

00:20:54.710 --> 00:20:57.580 align:middle line:84%
but in a very real way, just
because I was so focused.

00:20:57.580 --> 00:20:58.960 align:middle line:90%
And this was so fascinating.

00:20:58.960 --> 00:21:00.710 align:middle line:84%
I didn't understand
what was going on,

00:21:00.710 --> 00:21:02.680 align:middle line:84%
and I wanted to take
in as much information

00:21:02.680 --> 00:21:05.440 align:middle line:84%
that I could have and
keep as much information

00:21:05.440 --> 00:21:06.860 align:middle line:90%
that I could have as well.

00:21:06.860 --> 00:21:08.320 align:middle line:90%
So one day, I could share that.

00:21:08.320 --> 00:21:11.020 align:middle line:84%
Because there's a lot of
proof of what I'm telling you,

00:21:11.020 --> 00:21:14.410 align:middle line:84%
where you see there's no making
up what's going on over here.

00:21:14.410 --> 00:21:16.090 align:middle line:90%
But we'll talk about that later.

00:21:16.090 --> 00:21:20.345 align:middle line:84%
In that meeting, the man
who first approached me,

00:21:20.345 --> 00:21:22.720 align:middle line:84%
who we're going to call Ray--
that's not his actual name.

00:21:22.720 --> 00:21:24.670 align:middle line:84%
But the man who
first approached me,

00:21:24.670 --> 00:21:26.500 align:middle line:90%
he wants to remain anonymous.

00:21:26.500 --> 00:21:27.310 align:middle line:90%
We call him Ray.

00:21:27.310 --> 00:21:28.960 align:middle line:84%
So that's what I'm
going to call him.

00:21:28.960 --> 00:21:32.830 align:middle line:84%
He basically was instructed
to write this document,

00:21:32.830 --> 00:21:34.240 align:middle line:90%
called The Pyramid Code.

00:21:34.240 --> 00:21:37.180 align:middle line:84%
In Hebrew, they call
it [NON-ENGLISH]..

00:21:37.180 --> 00:21:38.980 align:middle line:84%
The reason why I'm
saying in Hebrew

00:21:38.980 --> 00:21:41.920 align:middle line:84%
is not because this is anything
to do with Judaism whatsoever.

00:21:41.920 --> 00:21:43.610 align:middle line:90%
This is not about religion.

00:21:43.610 --> 00:21:46.010 align:middle line:84%
This is not about one
religion over another.

00:21:46.010 --> 00:21:47.852 align:middle line:84%
The organization
does not identify

00:21:47.852 --> 00:21:49.060 align:middle line:90%
with a religion over another.

00:21:49.060 --> 00:21:51.100 align:middle line:84%
There are people from
all walks of life,

00:21:51.100 --> 00:21:52.597 align:middle line:90%
of all sexual orientations.

00:21:52.597 --> 00:21:53.680 align:middle line:90%
There are straight people.

00:21:53.680 --> 00:21:54.550 align:middle line:90%
There's gay people.

00:21:54.550 --> 00:21:55.030 align:middle line:90%
There's men.

00:21:55.030 --> 00:21:55.870 align:middle line:90%
There's women.

00:21:55.870 --> 00:21:57.610 align:middle line:90%
There's people of all ages.

00:21:57.610 --> 00:21:59.650 align:middle line:90%
There's people of all religions.

00:21:59.650 --> 00:22:02.367 align:middle line:84%
The only thing I would say that
there really isn't is atheists,

00:22:02.367 --> 00:22:04.450 align:middle line:84%
because I don't really
know what's going on there.

00:22:04.450 --> 00:22:07.840 align:middle line:84%
Everybody in the organization
does understand that there's

00:22:07.840 --> 00:22:09.160 align:middle line:90%
some form of higher power.

00:22:09.160 --> 00:22:10.480 align:middle line:90%
Call it whatever you want.

00:22:10.480 --> 00:22:12.430 align:middle line:84%
Whatever you want to
call that, there's

00:22:12.430 --> 00:22:15.660 align:middle line:84%
some form of organization
orchestration within creation

00:22:15.660 --> 00:22:16.690 align:middle line:90%
in this universe.

00:22:16.690 --> 00:22:19.900 align:middle line:84%
If you want to call it source,
universal, awareness, god,

00:22:19.900 --> 00:22:23.050 align:middle line:84%
whatever it is, they don't
like using the word god

00:22:23.050 --> 00:22:24.668 align:middle line:84%
because it's been
corrupted over time.

00:22:24.668 --> 00:22:26.710 align:middle line:84%
As a matter of fact, when
you spell it backwards,

00:22:26.710 --> 00:22:29.990 align:middle line:84%
it spells dog, but we could
talk about that in another time.

00:22:29.990 --> 00:22:32.830 align:middle line:84%
So throughout this
meeting, he was

00:22:32.830 --> 00:22:35.740 align:middle line:84%
asked to document this document
called The Pyramid Code.

00:22:35.740 --> 00:22:40.390 align:middle line:84%
And his first
language is Hebrew.

00:22:40.390 --> 00:22:42.940 align:middle line:90%
Hebrew is not a Jewish language.

00:22:42.940 --> 00:22:45.130 align:middle line:84%
Hebrew is a language
that existed

00:22:45.130 --> 00:22:48.010 align:middle line:84%
before the Jewish
religion existed.

00:22:48.010 --> 00:22:49.480 align:middle line:90%
The pharaohs used it.

00:22:49.480 --> 00:22:52.930 align:middle line:84%
The alphabet was used by the
Assyrians and the Sumerians

00:22:52.930 --> 00:22:54.190 align:middle line:90%
and all those people.

00:22:54.190 --> 00:23:00.100 align:middle line:84%
And there came a point where the
Hebrews, when they, so-called,

00:23:00.100 --> 00:23:01.810 align:middle line:84%
according to the Old
Testament, received

00:23:01.810 --> 00:23:05.260 align:middle line:84%
the Torah on Mount Sinai,
received it in that language.

00:23:05.260 --> 00:23:08.890 align:middle line:84%
They adopted that language,
so they call it Hebrew.

00:23:08.890 --> 00:23:11.080 align:middle line:84%
It has nothing to do
with Judaism in its base.

00:23:11.080 --> 00:23:13.870 align:middle line:84%
As a matter of fact, it's
one of the few languages

00:23:13.870 --> 00:23:15.250 align:middle line:90%
that was discovered.

00:23:15.250 --> 00:23:16.720 align:middle line:90%
It wasn't created.

00:23:16.720 --> 00:23:19.630 align:middle line:84%
Discovered, meaning it's
a mathematical language.

00:23:19.630 --> 00:23:21.700 align:middle line:84%
It's a language
based on numerology.

00:23:21.700 --> 00:23:24.130 align:middle line:84%
It's a language based
off of understanding

00:23:24.130 --> 00:23:26.230 align:middle line:84%
the laws of creation,
understanding

00:23:26.230 --> 00:23:28.040 align:middle line:90%
the frequencies of creation.

00:23:28.040 --> 00:23:31.930 align:middle line:84%
For example, the word life
in Hebrew [NON-ENGLISH]..

00:23:31.930 --> 00:23:34.660 align:middle line:84%
[NON-ENGLISH] is spelled with
two letters, [NON-ENGLISH]..

00:23:34.660 --> 00:23:35.840 align:middle line:90%
[NON-ENGLISH] is 8.

00:23:35.840 --> 00:23:36.640 align:middle line:90%
[NON-ENGLISH].

00:23:36.640 --> 00:23:37.440 align:middle line:90%
Is 10.

00:23:37.440 --> 00:23:38.890 align:middle line:84%
When you add them
up, you get 18.

00:23:38.890 --> 00:23:42.040 align:middle line:84%
18 is known to be the
resonance of life that's

00:23:42.040 --> 00:23:42.970 align:middle line:90%
been inverted today.

00:23:42.970 --> 00:23:45.640 align:middle line:84%
They've taken 666 and
called it satanic.

00:23:45.640 --> 00:23:47.650 align:middle line:90%
666 equates to 18.

00:23:47.650 --> 00:23:49.750 align:middle line:84%
It's a very, very
powerful frequency,

00:23:49.750 --> 00:23:52.630 align:middle line:84%
and they've steered us away
from something like that.

00:23:52.630 --> 00:23:55.990 align:middle line:84%
The word love, [NON-ENGLISH].,.,
Spelled to four letters.

00:23:55.990 --> 00:23:58.180 align:middle line:90%
[NON-ENGLISH].

00:23:58.180 --> 00:24:01.930 align:middle line:84%
And when you add those
up, you get 5, 2, 1, 5.

00:24:01.930 --> 00:24:02.753 align:middle line:90%
That's 13.

00:24:02.753 --> 00:24:05.170 align:middle line:84%
That's the next number that
was inverted that we were told

00:24:05.170 --> 00:24:06.640 align:middle line:90%
is unlucky, stay away from.

00:24:06.640 --> 00:24:07.630 align:middle line:90%
It's bad.

00:24:07.630 --> 00:24:09.670 align:middle line:90%
But it's the frequency of love.

00:24:09.670 --> 00:24:12.300 align:middle line:84%
And back to the
frequency of life, 18,

00:24:12.300 --> 00:24:14.050 align:middle line:84%
have you ever taken
the Schumann resonance

00:24:14.050 --> 00:24:16.270 align:middle line:84%
and added those numbers
up and its base form?

00:24:16.270 --> 00:24:17.560 align:middle line:90%
7.83hz.

00:24:17.560 --> 00:24:19.150 align:middle line:90%
You get 18.

00:24:19.150 --> 00:24:21.250 align:middle line:84%
They knew those
things back then,

00:24:21.250 --> 00:24:23.650 align:middle line:84%
just like ancient
Chinese medicine.

00:24:23.650 --> 00:24:26.080 align:middle line:84%
They knew things back then,
about how the body works

00:24:26.080 --> 00:24:28.090 align:middle line:84%
and how the energy
centers in the body

00:24:28.090 --> 00:24:29.560 align:middle line:84%
works and the
optimal frequencies

00:24:29.560 --> 00:24:30.880 align:middle line:90%
of each organ in the body.

00:24:30.880 --> 00:24:34.030 align:middle line:84%
There was a different level
of awareness back then.

00:24:34.030 --> 00:24:36.040 align:middle line:84%
That was taken
away from, and it's

00:24:36.040 --> 00:24:38.350 align:middle line:84%
time to go and get
that awareness back.

00:24:38.350 --> 00:24:41.500 align:middle line:84%
So part of the reason why this
document was written in Hebrew

00:24:41.500 --> 00:24:44.680 align:middle line:84%
is because there are also
codes embedded in the document,

00:24:44.680 --> 00:24:46.810 align:middle line:84%
just like there are codes
embedded in the Bible.

00:24:46.810 --> 00:24:48.250 align:middle line:90%
I don't know those codes.

00:24:48.250 --> 00:24:50.050 align:middle line:84%
But when you
understand those codes,

00:24:50.050 --> 00:24:53.710 align:middle line:84%
it unlocks a different level of
power that this document holds.

00:24:53.710 --> 00:24:56.260 align:middle line:84%
So he's instructed to
write this document.

00:24:56.260 --> 00:24:58.870 align:middle line:90%
This was February 6, 2020.

00:24:58.870 --> 00:25:01.100 align:middle line:90%
And there was one condition.

00:25:01.100 --> 00:25:03.160 align:middle line:90%
You have to give it to every--

00:25:03.160 --> 00:25:05.590 align:middle line:84%
the leader of the meeting
basically told him,

00:25:05.590 --> 00:25:07.780 align:middle line:84%
you have to give it to
everybody in this meeting.

00:25:07.780 --> 00:25:10.880 align:middle line:84%
You cannot hold it back from
anybody in this meeting.

00:25:10.880 --> 00:25:11.990 align:middle line:90%
He said, OK.

00:25:11.990 --> 00:25:14.810 align:middle line:84%
In June, a few months
later, four months,

00:25:14.810 --> 00:25:17.030 align:middle line:84%
fast forward, I
get the document.

00:25:17.030 --> 00:25:20.430 align:middle line:84%
It was originally handwritten,
then it was typed.

00:25:20.430 --> 00:25:22.070 align:middle line:84%
Now I don't know
Hebrew like that.

00:25:22.070 --> 00:25:23.942 align:middle line:84%
I still don't know
Hebrew like that.

00:25:23.942 --> 00:25:26.150 align:middle line:84%
So I'm getting this thing,
and I'm trying to read it.

00:25:26.150 --> 00:25:28.520 align:middle line:84%
And I don't really understand
because it's hard for me

00:25:28.520 --> 00:25:29.320 align:middle line:90%
to read.

00:25:29.320 --> 00:25:33.030 align:middle line:84%
It's also written-- imagine
like Shakespearean English, only

00:25:33.030 --> 00:25:33.830 align:middle line:90%
Hebrew version.

00:25:33.830 --> 00:25:35.600 align:middle line:84%
It's like, not only
do I not know Hebrew,

00:25:35.600 --> 00:25:36.770 align:middle line:90%
but they're giving me that.

00:25:36.770 --> 00:25:38.310 align:middle line:90%
I don't know what to do with it.

00:25:38.310 --> 00:25:40.430 align:middle line:84%
So I sat down with somebody
from the organization.

00:25:40.430 --> 00:25:42.920 align:middle line:84%
She helped me translate it,
and we got it into English.

00:25:42.920 --> 00:25:44.045 align:middle line:90%
And I'm reading this thing.

00:25:44.045 --> 00:25:45.230 align:middle line:90%
And it's blowing my mind.

00:25:45.230 --> 00:25:47.880 align:middle line:84%
I'm like, my god, this needs
to be shared with everybody.

00:25:47.880 --> 00:25:52.610 align:middle line:84%
So the organization, TLS, wanted
Ray to share it with the world.

00:25:52.610 --> 00:25:56.438 align:middle line:84%
And Ray, being the person who he
is, wants to remain anonymous.

00:25:56.438 --> 00:25:58.980 align:middle line:84%
He doesn't want to deal with
everything that comes with that.

00:25:58.980 --> 00:26:00.380 align:middle line:90%
He said, no.

00:26:00.380 --> 00:26:02.220 align:middle line:90%
And I said, no.

00:26:02.220 --> 00:26:03.080 align:middle line:90%
There is no no.

00:26:03.080 --> 00:26:04.110 align:middle line:90%
We're going to share it.

00:26:04.110 --> 00:26:05.330 align:middle line:84%
We're going to find
a way to share it.

00:26:05.330 --> 00:26:07.970 align:middle line:84%
And we went back and forth for
a few weeks, back and forth,

00:26:07.970 --> 00:26:09.800 align:middle line:84%
and back and forth,
and back and forth,

00:26:09.800 --> 00:26:11.770 align:middle line:90%
until there was a compromise.

00:26:11.770 --> 00:26:16.380 align:middle line:84%
And the compromise was between
me, Ray, and the organization.

00:26:16.380 --> 00:26:19.080 align:middle line:84%
The compromise was Jason,
if you want to do it,

00:26:19.080 --> 00:26:20.682 align:middle line:84%
and you want to
put it out so bad,

00:26:20.682 --> 00:26:22.390 align:middle line:84%
you're going to be
the one to put it out.

00:26:22.390 --> 00:26:23.807 align:middle line:84%
But you're going
to have to remove

00:26:23.807 --> 00:26:25.770 align:middle line:84%
the names from the
document to preserve

00:26:25.770 --> 00:26:28.325 align:middle line:84%
the anonymity and the
identity, of the individuals

00:26:28.325 --> 00:26:29.700 align:middle line:84%
in this document,
out of fairness

00:26:29.700 --> 00:26:31.290 align:middle line:90%
to them in their own privacy.

00:26:31.290 --> 00:26:33.030 align:middle line:84%
The only name that
they had me keep

00:26:33.030 --> 00:26:35.110 align:middle line:84%
was my name in the
actual document.

00:26:35.110 --> 00:26:37.740 align:middle line:84%
And one other person's name,
who happens to be a rabbi,

00:26:37.740 --> 00:26:40.150 align:middle line:84%
but again, not connected
to religion whatsoever.

00:26:40.150 --> 00:26:42.540 align:middle line:90%
We could talk about that.

00:26:42.540 --> 00:26:45.480 align:middle line:84%
One of the names in there
happens to be a rabbi's name.

00:26:45.480 --> 00:26:50.070 align:middle line:84%
And basically, I mean,
imagine, I said, no.

00:26:50.070 --> 00:26:51.570 align:middle line:84%
I couldn't say no
because I was just

00:26:51.570 --> 00:26:52.990 align:middle line:84%
fighting with Ray over
the past few weeks,

00:26:52.990 --> 00:26:54.407 align:middle line:84%
and why aren't you
putting it out?

00:26:54.407 --> 00:26:56.250 align:middle line:90%
So I said yes.

00:26:56.250 --> 00:27:02.370 align:middle line:84%
They gave me a date, September
9, 2020, 9:00 AM Eastern time.

00:27:02.370 --> 00:27:05.070 align:middle line:84%
I didn't have an Instagram
channel or a page.

00:27:05.070 --> 00:27:06.690 align:middle line:90%
I didn't have a Facebook page.

00:27:06.690 --> 00:27:08.340 align:middle line:90%
I didn't have a YouTube channel.

00:27:08.340 --> 00:27:09.910 align:middle line:90%
I didn't have a website.

00:27:09.910 --> 00:27:13.530 align:middle line:84%
I didn't have any presence
whatsoever in the public domain.

00:27:13.530 --> 00:27:16.440 align:middle line:84%
As a matter of fact, I had
three visits to my website,

00:27:16.440 --> 00:27:18.180 align:middle line:84%
because I just built
it for the purposes

00:27:18.180 --> 00:27:20.320 align:middle line:90%
of getting this thing out.

00:27:20.320 --> 00:27:23.220 align:middle line:84%
And I said, OK, I'll
put it out, but give me

00:27:23.220 --> 00:27:24.143 align:middle line:90%
the resource to do it.

00:27:24.143 --> 00:27:25.560 align:middle line:84%
You guys have all
the connections.

00:27:25.560 --> 00:27:26.550 align:middle line:90%
I'll be the face.

00:27:26.550 --> 00:27:29.513 align:middle line:84%
I'll be the speaker,
but help me.

00:27:29.513 --> 00:27:30.930 align:middle line:84%
They said, no,
you're on your own.

00:27:30.930 --> 00:27:33.030 align:middle line:90%
Figure it out.

00:27:33.030 --> 00:27:33.960 align:middle line:90%
I was pissed off.

00:27:33.960 --> 00:27:35.220 align:middle line:90%
I'm like, what do you mean?

00:27:35.220 --> 00:27:38.170 align:middle line:84%
You guys have all the power
in the world to get this out.

00:27:38.170 --> 00:27:39.420 align:middle line:90%
You guys want it out.

00:27:39.420 --> 00:27:41.440 align:middle line:90%
Give me give me the resources.

00:27:41.440 --> 00:27:42.240 align:middle line:90%
Let me tap into it.

00:27:42.240 --> 00:27:44.130 align:middle line:84%
The they said, no,
you're on your own.

00:27:44.130 --> 00:27:46.680 align:middle line:84%
It's going to get to exactly
who it needs to get to.

00:27:46.680 --> 00:27:50.520 align:middle line:10%
This was basically the
first mission or task

00:27:50.520 --> 00:27:51.460 align:middle line:10%
that they gave me.

00:27:51.460 --> 00:27:53.290 align:middle line:10%
And I wanted to prove myself.

00:27:53.290 --> 00:27:54.220 align:middle line:90%
So I sat down.

00:27:54.220 --> 00:27:55.020 align:middle line:90%
I didn't sleep.

00:27:55.020 --> 00:27:57.562 align:middle line:84%
My family thought I was crazy
because I was slacking at work.

00:27:57.562 --> 00:27:58.530 align:middle line:90%
I wasn't sleeping.

00:27:58.530 --> 00:28:00.270 align:middle line:84%
For three, four
weeks straight, this

00:28:00.270 --> 00:28:03.900 align:middle line:84%
was already July, almost
August, leading up to September

00:28:03.900 --> 00:28:04.980 align:middle line:90%
to the release date.

00:28:04.980 --> 00:28:06.480 align:middle line:84%
And I'm like, I got
to do something.

00:28:06.480 --> 00:28:08.190 align:middle line:90%
I got to get this out.

00:28:08.190 --> 00:28:11.392 align:middle line:84%
I emailed everybody-- and
I wasn't from this world,

00:28:11.392 --> 00:28:12.600 align:middle line:90%
so I had to learn this world.

00:28:12.600 --> 00:28:16.530 align:middle line:84%
I had to learn the grid of who's
who and who do we reach out to,

00:28:16.530 --> 00:28:19.230 align:middle line:84%
how do we do this in the most
efficient and effective way?

00:28:19.230 --> 00:28:20.355 align:middle line:90%
I didn't sleep.

00:28:20.355 --> 00:28:21.480 align:middle line:90%
I reached out to everybody.

00:28:21.480 --> 00:28:23.772 align:middle line:84%
As a matter of fact, one of
the people I reached out to

00:28:23.772 --> 00:28:25.300 align:middle line:90%
is also sitting in this room.

00:28:25.300 --> 00:28:27.180 align:middle line:90%
He's a producer on Gaia.

00:28:27.180 --> 00:28:31.207 align:middle line:84%
And he was one of the first
people that gave me belief

00:28:31.207 --> 00:28:32.040 align:middle line:90%
into what I'm doing.

00:28:32.040 --> 00:28:32.915 align:middle line:90%
And I even asked him.

00:28:32.915 --> 00:28:35.010 align:middle line:84%
I'm like, hey, why
do you believe me?

00:28:35.010 --> 00:28:37.410 align:middle line:90%
I'm in my early 20s.

00:28:37.410 --> 00:28:41.550 align:middle line:84%
How do you know I'm not
making this up for fame, for--

00:28:41.550 --> 00:28:43.643 align:middle line:84%
how do you know I'm
not making this up?

00:28:43.643 --> 00:28:45.060 align:middle line:84%
And there was a
whole story there,

00:28:45.060 --> 00:28:46.727 align:middle line:84%
having to do with a
remote viewer, where

00:28:46.727 --> 00:28:48.060 align:middle line:90%
he gave a document to this--

00:28:48.060 --> 00:28:50.370 align:middle line:84%
he gave the document
to this remote viewer

00:28:50.370 --> 00:28:52.710 align:middle line:84%
and gave her certain
coordinates of what

00:28:52.710 --> 00:28:54.475 align:middle line:84%
was listed in this
document without her

00:28:54.475 --> 00:28:55.600 align:middle line:90%
knowing about the document.

00:28:55.600 --> 00:28:57.690 align:middle line:84%
She came back with
the exact list

00:28:57.690 --> 00:28:59.925 align:middle line:84%
of what this document listed
before it went public.

00:28:59.925 --> 00:29:01.300 align:middle line:84%
So he said, that's
enough for me.

00:29:01.300 --> 00:29:04.300 align:middle line:84%
There's something going on
here that I don't understand.

00:29:04.300 --> 00:29:07.432 align:middle line:84%
So whether or not everything
you're saying is true,

00:29:07.432 --> 00:29:08.640 align:middle line:90%
there's some truth over here.

00:29:08.640 --> 00:29:09.440 align:middle line:90%
I'm interested.

00:29:09.440 --> 00:29:10.980 align:middle line:90%
I'm intrigued.

00:29:10.980 --> 00:29:12.520 align:middle line:84%
I said, OK, that's
very interesting.

00:29:12.520 --> 00:29:14.650 align:middle line:84%
And then I spoke to
the remote viewer.

00:29:14.650 --> 00:29:18.480 align:middle line:84%
So the story is, I
got this document.

00:29:18.480 --> 00:29:20.370 align:middle line:90%
I put it out on September 9.

00:29:20.370 --> 00:29:22.020 align:middle line:90%
I did my best to get it out.

00:29:22.020 --> 00:29:23.970 align:middle line:90%
I didn't have any page viewers.

00:29:23.970 --> 00:29:27.180 align:middle line:84%
And the second that document
came out to the public,

00:29:27.180 --> 00:29:31.200 align:middle line:84%
literally, in three hours,
it reached every continent

00:29:31.200 --> 00:29:32.040 align:middle line:90%
on Earth.

00:29:32.040 --> 00:29:34.690 align:middle line:84%
It reached millions of
people on the planet.

00:29:34.690 --> 00:29:36.750 align:middle line:84%
And that's the power
of the organization.

00:29:36.750 --> 00:29:39.420 align:middle line:84%
You know I can't do that because
I didn't have that reach.

00:29:39.420 --> 00:29:42.300 align:middle line:84%
There was something going
on here, where they used me

00:29:42.300 --> 00:29:45.000 align:middle line:84%
as a vehicle, a soldier,
whatever you want to call

00:29:45.000 --> 00:29:46.540 align:middle line:90%
it to get something done.

00:29:46.540 --> 00:29:47.340 align:middle line:90%
I agree.

00:29:47.340 --> 00:29:50.040 align:middle line:84%
Leading up to this, Ray kept
telling me, don't do it.

00:29:50.040 --> 00:29:50.880 align:middle line:90%
Don't do it.

00:29:50.880 --> 00:29:52.410 align:middle line:84%
Your life's going
to change forever.

00:29:52.410 --> 00:29:54.330 align:middle line:84%
Just stay in your
family's business.

00:29:54.330 --> 00:29:55.870 align:middle line:90%
Everything's fine.

00:29:55.870 --> 00:29:56.790 align:middle line:90%
But I couldn't.

00:29:56.790 --> 00:29:58.140 align:middle line:90%
Because it wasn't fulfilling.

00:29:58.140 --> 00:30:01.830 align:middle line:84%
I can't sit here, knowing that
everything is set in my life

00:30:01.830 --> 00:30:03.092 align:middle line:90%
because it is, and it was.

00:30:03.092 --> 00:30:04.050 align:middle line:90%
And I grew up that way.

00:30:04.050 --> 00:30:05.590 align:middle line:84%
And I want you
guys to know that.

00:30:05.590 --> 00:30:09.120 align:middle line:84%
And I'm not saying
that in any way to brag

00:30:09.120 --> 00:30:10.550 align:middle line:90%
or share or anything like that.

00:30:10.550 --> 00:30:13.520 align:middle line:84%
I want you guys to understand,
where I come from, none of this

00:30:13.520 --> 00:30:15.350 align:middle line:90%
was necessary.

00:30:15.350 --> 00:30:17.490 align:middle line:84%
There was everybody
telling me, don't do this,

00:30:17.490 --> 00:30:18.860 align:middle line:90%
including my own family.

00:30:18.860 --> 00:30:20.940 align:middle line:84%
They were saying,
please don't do this.

00:30:20.940 --> 00:30:22.710 align:middle line:84%
Everybody's going to
think we're crazy.

00:30:22.710 --> 00:30:24.418 align:middle line:84%
They're going to come
after our business.

00:30:24.418 --> 00:30:25.510 align:middle line:90%
Don't do it.

00:30:25.510 --> 00:30:27.160 align:middle line:90%
And I couldn't not do it.

00:30:27.160 --> 00:30:30.013 align:middle line:84%
Because I think the
resonance of truth

00:30:30.013 --> 00:30:31.930 align:middle line:84%
just holds something a
whole lot more powerful

00:30:31.930 --> 00:30:34.075 align:middle line:84%
than how successful
your business is going,

00:30:34.075 --> 00:30:35.200 align:middle line:90%
and just to be comfortable.

00:30:35.200 --> 00:30:38.410 align:middle line:84%
If I had everything growing
up, and I saw so many people--

00:30:38.410 --> 00:30:41.900 align:middle line:84%
50% of the Earth lives
under the poverty line.

00:30:41.900 --> 00:30:44.420 align:middle line:84%
I couldn't sit there and
not do anything about it.

00:30:44.420 --> 00:30:45.918 align:middle line:84%
So that's where
this motivation--

00:30:45.918 --> 00:30:47.710 align:middle line:84%
even though everybody
thought I was crazy--

00:30:47.710 --> 00:30:49.002 align:middle line:90%
and they still think I'm crazy.

00:30:49.002 --> 00:30:50.953 align:middle line:84%
But everybody
thought I was crazy.

00:30:50.953 --> 00:30:52.120 align:middle line:90%
That's where the motivation.

00:30:52.120 --> 00:30:55.220 align:middle line:84%
The fuel really came from to
go and do something like that.

00:30:55.220 --> 00:30:59.740 align:middle line:10%
So I did it, and it started
this whole thing that's

00:30:59.740 --> 00:31:02.290 align:middle line:10%
still going up until today.

00:31:02.290 --> 00:31:06.260 align:middle line:84%
And there was a point
in 2021 where I said,

00:31:06.260 --> 00:31:09.610 align:middle line:84%
listen, Ray, everybody
thinks I'm crazy.

00:31:09.610 --> 00:31:11.785 align:middle line:84%
There's credibility
here because there

00:31:11.785 --> 00:31:14.410 align:middle line:84%
were people from the White House
that started asking questions.

00:31:14.410 --> 00:31:16.240 align:middle line:84%
And people were like, well,
if the White House cares,

00:31:16.240 --> 00:31:17.320 align:middle line:84%
then there's something
going on here.

00:31:17.320 --> 00:31:18.430 align:middle line:90%
It can't be nothing.

00:31:18.430 --> 00:31:19.545 align:middle line:90%
But I needed more.

00:31:19.545 --> 00:31:20.920 align:middle line:84%
And I wanted to
give people more.

00:31:20.920 --> 00:31:23.710 align:middle line:84%
And I'm basically the medium
now between the organization

00:31:23.710 --> 00:31:25.680 align:middle line:90%
and the public.

00:31:25.680 --> 00:31:31.000 align:middle line:90%
