00:00:11.850 --> 00:00:12.720 align:middle line:90%
>> Hello, Bashar.

00:00:12.720 --> 00:00:14.260 align:middle line:90%
>> And to you, good day.

00:00:14.260 --> 00:00:16.320 align:middle line:10%
>> Thank you so much
for taking my question.

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:17.310 align:middle line:10%
And I ask this--

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:19.200 align:middle line:10%
I just have one
question, and I ask it

00:00:19.200 --> 00:00:23.560 align:middle line:10%
with humility, and
gratitude, and as a student.

00:00:23.560 --> 00:00:29.820 align:middle line:84%
As a human being trying
to connect with a higher

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:32.850 align:middle line:84%
consciousness of
myself, and I think

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:36.540 align:middle line:84%
that I can speak for a lot of
other human beings in this room

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:39.390 align:middle line:90%
that when you--

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:41.490 align:middle line:84%
>> Are there human
beings in the room?

00:00:41.490 --> 00:00:45.180 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, spiritual beings
having a human experience.

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:47.550 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, all right.

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:50.940 align:middle line:84%
That when we are trying to
tune in to our higher self

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:54.270 align:middle line:84%
we can't not become
healers for not just

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:56.190 align:middle line:90%
ourselves but other people.

00:00:56.190 --> 00:01:02.400 align:middle line:84%
And my question is, do you have
any wisdom in helping us healers

00:01:02.400 --> 00:01:06.450 align:middle line:84%
or Reiki masters, yoga
teachers, psychotherapists,

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:09.990 align:middle line:84%
QHHT practitioners,
yoga instructors,

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:12.880 align:middle line:84%
I mean the whole
9 yards, anything

00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:17.680 align:middle line:84%
that can help us make sure we
take better care of ourselves

00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:18.700 align:middle line:90%
and not--

00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:21.050 align:middle line:84%
because we give so much
for other people that--

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:21.850 align:middle line:90%
>> All right.

00:01:21.850 --> 00:01:23.080 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:25.720 align:middle line:84%
You don't have to take
so much on your shoulders

00:01:25.720 --> 00:01:29.230 align:middle line:84%
because the idea
is any healer never

00:01:29.230 --> 00:01:32.170 align:middle line:90%
heals anyone directly ever.

00:01:32.170 --> 00:01:35.350 align:middle line:84%
You give off a vibration,
you share a vibration

00:01:35.350 --> 00:01:39.130 align:middle line:84%
that represents the healed
state by whatever technique

00:01:39.130 --> 00:01:40.600 align:middle line:90%
you prefer.

00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:44.560 align:middle line:84%
It is up to the person
requiring the healing

00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:49.000 align:middle line:84%
to match the frequency in
order to heal themselves.

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:50.630 align:middle line:90%
You never heal them.

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:53.110 align:middle line:84%
So it's not like you're
really expending energy.

00:01:53.110 --> 00:01:54.430 align:middle line:90%
You're just being yourself.

00:01:54.430 --> 00:01:57.970 align:middle line:84%
You're saying here's the
vibration that I'm giving off

00:01:57.970 --> 00:02:00.490 align:middle line:90%
that is my natural state.

00:02:00.490 --> 00:02:03.160 align:middle line:84%
I'm a living example
of that state.

00:02:03.160 --> 00:02:04.900 align:middle line:84%
I'm giving off
the frequency that

00:02:04.900 --> 00:02:08.410 align:middle line:84%
represents a healed state
potentially for you.

00:02:08.410 --> 00:02:11.980 align:middle line:84%
But you have to be responsible
for mirroring that state,

00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:14.980 align:middle line:84%
for matching that
vibration within yourself

00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:18.460 align:middle line:84%
in order to experience
the healing because,

00:02:18.460 --> 00:02:21.340 align:middle line:84%
again, as we said
earlier, whatever

00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:24.710 align:middle line:84%
they do with whatever you give
them is none of your business.

00:02:24.710 --> 00:02:27.760 align:middle line:84%
So it's only when you
think you must heal them

00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:31.630 align:middle line:84%
that it must be your business
to heal other people that it

00:02:31.630 --> 00:02:34.240 align:middle line:84%
becomes a burden to
you and wears you down

00:02:34.240 --> 00:02:37.990 align:middle line:84%
because you're taking on a
responsibility that isn't yours.

00:02:37.990 --> 00:02:39.850 align:middle line:90%
It's their responsibility.

00:02:39.850 --> 00:02:41.800 align:middle line:90%
You're not responsible for them.

00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:46.270 align:middle line:84%
You're responsible to them
to be yourself and give them

00:02:46.270 --> 00:02:51.250 align:middle line:84%
the option to see, in you, the
example of the state that would

00:02:51.250 --> 00:02:53.050 align:middle line:90%
allow them to heal themselves.

00:02:53.050 --> 00:02:56.020 align:middle line:84%
But the rest of it is
up to them because you

00:02:56.020 --> 00:02:56.980 align:middle line:90%
don't know their path.

00:02:56.980 --> 00:02:58.340 align:middle line:84%
You don't know what
they're going through.

00:02:58.340 --> 00:03:00.173 align:middle line:84%
You don't know what
they need to experience.

00:03:00.173 --> 00:03:04.900 align:middle line:84%
And many people may come to you
to prove they cannot be healed.

00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:07.930 align:middle line:84%
And therefore, you have given
them exactly what they came for,

00:03:07.930 --> 00:03:10.670 align:middle line:90%
no healing whatsoever.

00:03:10.670 --> 00:03:15.970 align:middle line:84%
So the idea is it's not up to
you to determine what they need.

00:03:15.970 --> 00:03:18.310 align:middle line:84%
It's up to you to
determine, here's

00:03:18.310 --> 00:03:21.280 align:middle line:84%
the vibrational option
and opportunity for you

00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:25.490 align:middle line:84%
to decide for yourself
whether or not to match it.

00:03:25.490 --> 00:03:28.870 align:middle line:84%
And if you do, you may
experience a healing.

00:03:28.870 --> 00:03:32.380 align:middle line:84%
But the idea is it's not your
business that they should.

00:03:32.380 --> 00:03:33.640 align:middle line:90%
Does that help you?

00:03:33.640 --> 00:03:34.450 align:middle line:90%
>> Very much so.

00:03:34.450 --> 00:03:34.900 align:middle line:90%
Thank you so much.

00:03:34.900 --> 00:03:36.830 align:middle line:84%
>> Does that take the
weight off your shoulders?

00:03:36.830 --> 00:03:38.050 align:middle line:90%
>> I have a lot more peace now.

00:03:38.050 --> 00:03:38.710 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:03:38.710 --> 00:03:39.510 align:middle line:90%
>> Thank you.

00:03:39.510 --> 00:03:44.610 align:middle line:90%


00:03:44.610 --> 00:03:51.040 align:middle line:84%
This is about responsibility,
the ability to respond.

00:03:51.040 --> 00:03:51.840 align:middle line:90%
>> Hello, Bashar.

00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:54.350 align:middle line:90%
>> And to you, good day.

00:03:54.350 --> 00:03:55.150 align:middle line:90%
>> Thank you.

00:03:55.150 --> 00:03:56.800 align:middle line:90%
Thank you for this opportunity.

00:03:56.800 --> 00:04:00.360 align:middle line:10%
I am translating for my
friend who has come over

00:04:00.360 --> 00:04:02.770 align:middle line:10%
to see you from Japan.

00:04:02.770 --> 00:04:05.100 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:04:05.100 --> 00:04:07.560 align:middle line:90%
[SPEAKING JAPANESE]

00:04:07.560 --> 00:04:08.640 align:middle line:90%
>> Good day.

00:04:08.640 --> 00:04:09.440 align:middle line:90%
Konnichiwa.

00:04:09.440 --> 00:04:11.645 align:middle line:90%
>> Konnichiwa.

00:04:11.645 --> 00:04:13.830 align:middle line:90%
[SPEAKING JAPANESE]

00:04:13.830 --> 00:04:36.850 align:middle line:90%


00:04:36.850 --> 00:04:44.320 align:middle line:10%
>> 2012, in Canada, he has heard
one voice saying he represents

00:04:44.320 --> 00:04:49.390 align:middle line:10%
himself as an ET and he told him
that he is going to change his

00:04:49.390 --> 00:04:51.640 align:middle line:10%
DNA.

00:04:51.640 --> 00:04:52.810 align:middle line:90%
>> All right.

00:04:52.810 --> 00:04:54.560 align:middle line:90%
[SPEAKING JAPANESE]

00:04:54.560 --> 00:05:20.800 align:middle line:90%


00:05:20.800 --> 00:05:26.110 align:middle line:10%
>> Now since then, he's
been a spiritual healer.

00:05:26.110 --> 00:05:33.610 align:middle line:84%
And his one question for
you is, is ET come over

00:05:33.610 --> 00:05:39.940 align:middle line:84%
from somewhere else to the Earth
to become the Earth people,

00:05:39.940 --> 00:05:51.290 align:middle line:84%
or we human can become ET
as well, reversible, or even

00:05:51.290 --> 00:05:58.220 align:middle line:84%
in the middle way, ET can be
a human or we can become ET?

00:05:58.220 --> 00:05:59.480 align:middle line:90%
That's his question.

00:05:59.480 --> 00:06:00.380 align:middle line:90%
>> All right.

00:06:00.380 --> 00:06:04.670 align:middle line:84%
Well, the idea is that you are
all spirits, spirits of ET,

00:06:04.670 --> 00:06:07.730 align:middle line:84%
spirits of human are the
same kind of spirits.

00:06:07.730 --> 00:06:12.170 align:middle line:84%
So any kind of spirit can become
any kind of physical being,

00:06:12.170 --> 00:06:14.480 align:middle line:84%
can become a human,
can become an ET.

00:06:14.480 --> 00:06:17.600 align:middle line:84%
And a human, when they
die, can become spirit

00:06:17.600 --> 00:06:19.730 align:middle line:90%
and decide to be anything else.

00:06:19.730 --> 00:06:22.470 align:middle line:90%
Is this answering your question?

00:06:22.470 --> 00:06:24.630 align:middle line:90%
[SPEAKING JAPANESE]

00:06:24.630 --> 00:06:26.437 align:middle line:90%
>> Thank you so much.

00:06:26.437 --> 00:06:34.720 align:middle line:90%


00:06:34.720 --> 00:06:36.010 align:middle line:90%
>> Hello and good day, Bashar.

00:06:36.010 --> 00:06:38.470 align:middle line:90%
>> Good day to you.

00:06:38.470 --> 00:06:41.790 align:middle line:84%
>> So I think many or most of
us here are in agreement that we

00:06:41.790 --> 00:06:44.340 align:middle line:84%
need to expand our consciousness
and we need to raise

00:06:44.340 --> 00:06:46.890 align:middle line:90%
the vibration of the planet.

00:06:46.890 --> 00:06:53.340 align:middle line:10%
And my one question for you is,
how difficult is that concerning

00:06:53.340 --> 00:06:56.160 align:middle line:10%
the current state
of economic affairs,

00:06:56.160 --> 00:07:01.050 align:middle line:10%
specifically that it's based
upon a centralized fiat

00:07:01.050 --> 00:07:03.990 align:middle line:10%
currency, which keeps us in a
lower state of consciousness,

00:07:03.990 --> 00:07:06.390 align:middle line:10%
and a state of survival
and fear based living.

00:07:06.390 --> 00:07:11.970 align:middle line:84%
And does a more egalitarian,
decentralized solution

00:07:11.970 --> 00:07:16.020 align:middle line:84%
like Bitcoin help humanity
raise our vibration

00:07:16.020 --> 00:07:17.700 align:middle line:90%
and raise our consciousness?

00:07:17.700 --> 00:07:18.905 align:middle line:90%
>> No.

00:07:18.905 --> 00:07:21.030 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:07:21.030 --> 00:07:25.470 align:middle line:84%
It's still an arbitrary
medium of exchange.

00:07:25.470 --> 00:07:28.800 align:middle line:84%
It's still an arbitrary
medium of exchange.

00:07:28.800 --> 00:07:33.090 align:middle line:84%
And the idea is that it may be a
step in the direction of letting

00:07:33.090 --> 00:07:35.020 align:middle line:90%
go of that kind of idea.

00:07:35.020 --> 00:07:36.960 align:middle line:84%
But it's not really
something that

00:07:36.960 --> 00:07:40.860 align:middle line:84%
will last as we sense the
overall energy of your world.

00:07:40.860 --> 00:07:45.060 align:middle line:84%
But the degree of difficulty
is in the difficulty

00:07:45.060 --> 00:07:47.230 align:middle line:90%
that you believe it is.

00:07:47.230 --> 00:07:49.170 align:middle line:84%
So remember there's
no such thing

00:07:49.170 --> 00:07:52.200 align:middle line:84%
as an inherently
difficult situation, only

00:07:52.200 --> 00:07:53.940 align:middle line:90%
a belief in difficulty.

00:07:53.940 --> 00:07:56.500 align:middle line:84%
And do you remember
what we said earlier,

00:07:56.500 --> 00:07:59.760 align:middle line:84%
you never change the
planet you're on.

00:07:59.760 --> 00:08:02.100 align:middle line:90%
That planet always remains.

00:08:02.100 --> 00:08:04.710 align:middle line:84%
You shift yourself to
another version of Earth

00:08:04.710 --> 00:08:07.230 align:middle line:84%
that is different
when you are different

00:08:07.230 --> 00:08:09.600 align:middle line:90%
and match that version of Earth.

00:08:09.600 --> 00:08:11.700 align:middle line:90%
Do you understand?

00:08:11.700 --> 00:08:12.720 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:08:12.720 --> 00:08:16.140 align:middle line:84%
>> So it's not that you have to
change the world you're on, you

00:08:16.140 --> 00:08:19.470 align:middle line:84%
have to change yourselves and
wind up on a different version

00:08:19.470 --> 00:08:20.581 align:middle line:90%
of Earth.

00:08:20.581 --> 00:08:23.287 align:middle line:90%
[APPLAUSE]

00:08:23.287 --> 00:08:24.640 align:middle line:90%


00:08:24.640 --> 00:08:28.760 align:middle line:84%
Now do you think that
might be difficult?

00:08:28.760 --> 00:08:29.560 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:08:29.560 --> 00:08:33.039 align:middle line:84%
>> Remember this, just
because-- for now,

00:08:33.039 --> 00:08:38.169 align:middle line:84%
just because you can see people
making choices that may be

00:08:38.169 --> 00:08:42.789 align:middle line:84%
vibrationally incompatible with
what you prefer doesn't mean

00:08:42.789 --> 00:08:46.420 align:middle line:84%
you're in the same reality
because now is the time

00:08:46.420 --> 00:08:47.350 align:middle line:90%
of choosing.

00:08:47.350 --> 00:08:50.710 align:middle line:84%
It's like there are glass walls
between the different realities.

00:08:50.710 --> 00:08:53.180 align:middle line:84%
You can see what's
on the other side.

00:08:53.180 --> 00:08:55.600 align:middle line:84%
You can see people
making choices

00:08:55.600 --> 00:08:58.180 align:middle line:84%
that are not vibrationally
compatible with you

00:08:58.180 --> 00:09:00.230 align:middle line:90%
and the world that you prefer.

00:09:00.230 --> 00:09:02.480 align:middle line:84%
But that doesn't mean
that they're affecting you

00:09:02.480 --> 00:09:05.770 align:middle line:84%
because what they're doing
can't penetrate the glass wall.

00:09:05.770 --> 00:09:08.120 align:middle line:84%
It just gives you an
opportunity to see it

00:09:08.120 --> 00:09:10.180 align:middle line:84%
so that, if you agree
with it, you can choose it

00:09:10.180 --> 00:09:13.120 align:middle line:84%
just like it gives them an
opportunity to see you so,

00:09:13.120 --> 00:09:15.370 align:middle line:84%
if they agree with you, they
can choose the way you're

00:09:15.370 --> 00:09:17.260 align:middle line:90%
doing things as well.

00:09:17.260 --> 00:09:20.660 align:middle line:84%
But eventually,
this splitting prism

00:09:20.660 --> 00:09:23.270 align:middle line:84%
of all these different
reality choices

00:09:23.270 --> 00:09:25.610 align:middle line:84%
will eventually
become so isolated

00:09:25.610 --> 00:09:28.280 align:middle line:84%
that you will only eventually,
in the years to come,

00:09:28.280 --> 00:09:31.490 align:middle line:84%
experience people that
are basically compatible

00:09:31.490 --> 00:09:34.550 align:middle line:84%
vibrationally with the
path that you have chosen.

00:09:34.550 --> 00:09:36.720 align:middle line:84%
And you will no longer
see the other ones.

00:09:36.720 --> 00:09:38.903 align:middle line:84%
But for now, you
can still see it all

00:09:38.903 --> 00:09:40.820 align:middle line:84%
because you're getting
it all out on the table

00:09:40.820 --> 00:09:42.740 align:middle line:84%
to give you all
the choices so you

00:09:42.740 --> 00:09:45.050 align:middle line:84%
can decide what kind of
a world you would really

00:09:45.050 --> 00:09:46.310 align:middle line:90%
like to shift to.

00:09:46.310 --> 00:09:49.250 align:middle line:84%
That's why we call this
the time of transformation,

00:09:49.250 --> 00:09:52.670 align:middle line:84%
the time of choice,
the time of change.

00:09:52.670 --> 00:09:54.770 align:middle line:84%
You now have all
the opportunities

00:09:54.770 --> 00:09:58.430 align:middle line:84%
to decide what vibration
you wish to lock on to.

00:09:58.430 --> 00:10:01.310 align:middle line:84%
Metaphorically speaking,
which train you

00:10:01.310 --> 00:10:04.520 align:middle line:84%
would like to board as it leaves
the station because they're

00:10:04.520 --> 00:10:06.050 align:middle line:90%
going in different directions.

00:10:06.050 --> 00:10:08.780 align:middle line:84%
And eventually, the tracks
will be so far apart,

00:10:08.780 --> 00:10:11.750 align:middle line:84%
you will find it a challenge
to go from one train

00:10:11.750 --> 00:10:15.140 align:middle line:84%
to another, if you don't choose
while the trains are still

00:10:15.140 --> 00:10:17.720 align:middle line:90%
in the station.

00:10:17.720 --> 00:10:19.490 align:middle line:90%
Does that help you?

00:10:19.490 --> 00:10:20.400 align:middle line:90%
>> Thank you, Bashar.

00:10:20.400 --> 00:10:21.200 align:middle line:90%
>> You are welcome.

00:10:21.200 --> 00:10:26.510 align:middle line:90%


00:10:26.510 --> 00:10:28.460 align:middle line:90%
So all aboard.

00:10:28.460 --> 00:10:31.840 align:middle line:90%


00:10:31.840 --> 00:10:32.640 align:middle line:90%
>> Hi, Bashar.

00:10:32.640 --> 00:10:33.780 align:middle line:90%
>> And to you, good day.

00:10:33.780 --> 00:10:35.170 align:middle line:90%
>> Nice to meet you.

00:10:35.170 --> 00:10:37.120 align:middle line:90%
>> And you as well.

00:10:37.120 --> 00:10:38.500 align:middle line:90%
>> So I have one question.

00:10:38.500 --> 00:10:39.300 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:10:39.300 --> 00:10:45.480 align:middle line:84%
>> So I understand matching a
vibrational frequency that I

00:10:45.480 --> 00:10:48.030 align:middle line:84%
prefer and then I
get that reality.

00:10:48.030 --> 00:10:49.660 align:middle line:84%
I've experienced
that many times.

00:10:49.660 --> 00:10:50.460 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:10:50.460 --> 00:10:53.220 align:middle line:90%
>> My struggle--

00:10:53.220 --> 00:10:54.630 align:middle line:90%
>> Your challenge.

00:10:54.630 --> 00:10:59.160 align:middle line:84%
>> My challenge is that
I'll do it, get the reality,

00:10:59.160 --> 00:11:00.930 align:middle line:90%
and then I'll lose--

00:11:00.930 --> 00:11:02.467 align:middle line:90%
seemingly lose the reality.

00:11:02.467 --> 00:11:04.050 align:middle line:84%
And I have to-- it's
like a cycle that

00:11:04.050 --> 00:11:05.530 align:middle line:90%
happens over and over again.

00:11:05.530 --> 00:11:07.390 align:middle line:90%
So I lose my manifestation.

00:11:07.390 --> 00:11:08.190 align:middle line:90%
>> All right.

00:11:08.190 --> 00:11:11.430 align:middle line:10%
Well, what do you believe
would happen if it stayed?

00:11:11.430 --> 00:11:14.440 align:middle line:84%
>> Sometimes I can't
fathom it staying.

00:11:14.440 --> 00:11:15.240 align:middle line:90%
It's like I'm--

00:11:15.240 --> 00:11:16.140 align:middle line:90%
>> There you go.

00:11:16.140 --> 00:11:17.710 align:middle line:90%
Then there you go.

00:11:17.710 --> 00:11:20.740 align:middle line:90%
Why can't you fathom it staying?

00:11:20.740 --> 00:11:22.360 align:middle line:90%
>> That's a good question.

00:11:22.360 --> 00:11:23.160 align:middle line:90%
>> Well.

00:11:23.160 --> 00:11:27.060 align:middle line:84%
Thank you, sometimes
we ask them.

00:11:27.060 --> 00:11:30.000 align:middle line:90%
Do you have a good answer?

00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:32.230 align:middle line:10%
Why can't you fathom it staying?

00:11:32.230 --> 00:11:34.420 align:middle line:84%
Are you afraid that
something is going

00:11:34.420 --> 00:11:37.540 align:middle line:84%
to happen that you won't
prefer if it stays?

00:11:37.540 --> 00:11:40.960 align:middle line:84%
>> Maybe I'm not
used to consistency.

00:11:40.960 --> 00:11:43.720 align:middle line:90%
I'm not used to long term--

00:11:43.720 --> 00:11:48.400 align:middle line:84%
like, maybe there's a belief
that, oh, yeah, it can't stay.

00:11:48.400 --> 00:11:51.610 align:middle line:84%
That's just too
good to be true or--

00:11:51.610 --> 00:11:54.910 align:middle line:84%
>> Are there things that
are too good to be true?

00:11:54.910 --> 00:11:58.940 align:middle line:84%
>> I, from the absolute point
of view, don't believe that.

00:11:58.940 --> 00:12:03.050 align:middle line:84%
But there's something
locally here, 3D wise,

00:12:03.050 --> 00:12:05.003 align:middle line:84%
that makes me
believe that about--

00:12:05.003 --> 00:12:06.920 align:middle line:84%
>> And what is it that
makes you believe that.

00:12:06.920 --> 00:12:09.500 align:middle line:84%
Because, again, remember you
don't hold on to any belief

00:12:09.500 --> 00:12:13.010 align:middle line:90%
that you don't think serves you.

00:12:13.010 --> 00:12:17.750 align:middle line:84%
So how does it serve you to not
have these things maintained?

00:12:17.750 --> 00:12:23.270 align:middle line:10%
>> Maybe I am afraid of
maintaining things that I prefer

00:12:23.270 --> 00:12:26.480 align:middle line:10%
because I'm afraid of--

00:12:26.480 --> 00:12:29.270 align:middle line:10%
>> Are you afraid that
people will reject you,

00:12:29.270 --> 00:12:33.110 align:middle line:10%
find you too foreign,
too alien, too different,

00:12:33.110 --> 00:12:35.000 align:middle line:10%
can't relate to you anymore?

00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:37.610 align:middle line:84%
Are you afraid you
will lose your friends?

00:12:37.610 --> 00:12:40.490 align:middle line:84%
Are you afraid you will
become bored with it?

00:12:40.490 --> 00:12:43.370 align:middle line:90%
What are you afraid of?

00:12:43.370 --> 00:12:49.700 align:middle line:84%
>> I'm afraid maybe that, if
something stays long term that I

00:12:49.700 --> 00:12:50.510 align:middle line:90%
prefer--

00:12:50.510 --> 00:12:51.310 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:12:51.310 --> 00:12:55.370 align:middle line:84%
>> I reach a goal and it
actually is consistent,

00:12:55.370 --> 00:12:58.700 align:middle line:84%
I'm afraid that if I lose
it later down the line,

00:12:58.700 --> 00:13:00.230 align:middle line:90%
it hurts even more.

00:13:00.230 --> 00:13:01.040 align:middle line:90%
>> Ah.

00:13:01.040 --> 00:13:03.410 align:middle line:84%
>> It's like maybe
long term is, like,

00:13:03.410 --> 00:13:06.970 align:middle line:90%
scary because it feels like--

00:13:06.970 --> 00:13:08.020 align:middle line:90%
>> Well, as you said.

00:13:08.020 --> 00:13:08.350 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:13:08.350 --> 00:13:09.580 align:middle line:90%
>> I'm going to get used to it.

00:13:09.580 --> 00:13:11.040 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to get
comfortable with it.

00:13:11.040 --> 00:13:11.180 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:13:11.180 --> 00:13:13.010 align:middle line:84%
>> And then suddenly
it'll be gone,

00:13:13.010 --> 00:13:15.410 align:middle line:84%
and I will feel
disappointed and bereft.

00:13:15.410 --> 00:13:16.210 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:13:16.210 --> 00:13:19.720 align:middle line:84%
So the disappointment of
losing it short term is less.

00:13:19.720 --> 00:13:20.590 align:middle line:90%
Maybe that's why.

00:13:20.590 --> 00:13:21.390 align:middle line:90%
>> All right.

00:13:21.390 --> 00:13:23.990 align:middle line:84%
So you are saving yourself the
disappointment in the long run.

00:13:23.990 --> 00:13:24.790 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:13:24.790 --> 00:13:27.123 align:middle line:84%
>> So that you can disappoint
yourself in the short run.

00:13:27.123 --> 00:13:29.740 align:middle line:90%


00:13:29.740 --> 00:13:31.190 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:13:31.190 --> 00:13:31.990 align:middle line:90%
>> All right.

00:13:31.990 --> 00:13:36.160 align:middle line:84%
Well, let me ask this question
based on a slight alteration

00:13:36.160 --> 00:13:37.550 align:middle line:90%
of the word in your language.

00:13:37.550 --> 00:13:38.350 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:13:38.350 --> 00:13:43.955 align:middle line:84%
>> Why are you disappointing
yourself from the position

00:13:43.955 --> 00:13:44.755 align:middle line:90%
of power?

00:13:44.755 --> 00:13:47.410 align:middle line:90%


00:13:47.410 --> 00:13:49.370 align:middle line:84%
>> That's another
great question.

00:13:49.370 --> 00:13:50.170 align:middle line:90%
>> Thank you.

00:13:50.170 --> 00:13:51.800 align:middle line:90%
>> You ask great questions.

00:13:51.800 --> 00:13:54.100 align:middle line:90%
>> Thank you.

00:13:54.100 --> 00:13:56.030 align:middle line:90%
We are happy to do so.

00:13:56.030 --> 00:13:56.830 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:13:56.830 --> 00:13:59.080 align:middle line:90%
I feel like I am--

00:13:59.080 --> 00:14:02.560 align:middle line:84%
are you saying that I'm
rejecting my own power.

00:14:02.560 --> 00:14:03.430 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:14:03.430 --> 00:14:03.850 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:14:03.850 --> 00:14:06.017 align:middle line:84%
>> You are removing yourself
from the driver's seat.

00:14:06.017 --> 00:14:10.010 align:middle line:90%
You are dis-appointing yourself.

00:14:10.010 --> 00:14:14.200 align:middle line:84%
Appoint yourself, and
stay in the driver's seat.

00:14:14.200 --> 00:14:18.920 align:middle line:84%
Why must something-- why
must something go away.

00:14:18.920 --> 00:14:22.330 align:middle line:84%
And if it does, wouldn't
there be a reason

00:14:22.330 --> 00:14:25.280 align:middle line:90%
for that would still serve you?

00:14:25.280 --> 00:14:26.080 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:14:26.080 --> 00:14:26.880 align:middle line:90%
>> All right.

00:14:26.880 --> 00:14:30.130 align:middle line:84%
You see, again, this is one of
the principles of the formula.

00:14:30.130 --> 00:14:33.070 align:middle line:84%
You stay in a positive
state no matter

00:14:33.070 --> 00:14:37.060 align:middle line:84%
what manifests in order to get
the benefit from it because even

00:14:37.060 --> 00:14:40.060 align:middle line:84%
if something manifests
that you neutrally,

00:14:40.060 --> 00:14:42.950 align:middle line:84%
objectively, don't
prefer, in other words,

00:14:42.950 --> 00:14:45.160 align:middle line:84%
you simply recognize
it's not vibrationally

00:14:45.160 --> 00:14:49.620 align:middle line:84%
compatible with what you prefer,
it's still there for a reason.

00:14:49.620 --> 00:14:52.190 align:middle line:84%
And if you stay in
a positive state,

00:14:52.190 --> 00:14:54.050 align:middle line:84%
you'll be able to
get a benefit out

00:14:54.050 --> 00:14:56.390 align:middle line:84%
of why it's there
instead of simply

00:14:56.390 --> 00:14:59.540 align:middle line:84%
reacting negatively and
continuing to perpetuate

00:14:59.540 --> 00:15:01.050 align:middle line:90%
the negative energy.

00:15:01.050 --> 00:15:05.600 align:middle line:84%
So the idea is that, even on
the simplest possible level,

00:15:05.600 --> 00:15:08.750 align:middle line:84%
if for no other reason,
seeing something

00:15:08.750 --> 00:15:12.770 align:middle line:84%
manifest that you don't
prefer makes it much clearer

00:15:12.770 --> 00:15:15.230 align:middle line:90%
by contrast what you do prefer.

00:15:15.230 --> 00:15:19.500 align:middle line:84%
And isn't that a positive way,
to use what you don't prefer?

00:15:19.500 --> 00:15:20.300 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:15:20.300 --> 00:15:22.790 align:middle line:84%
>> And therefore, when
you do it that way,

00:15:22.790 --> 00:15:25.820 align:middle line:84%
then what you don't prefer will
go away because you've used it

00:15:25.820 --> 00:15:27.230 align:middle line:90%
to a positive effect.

00:15:27.230 --> 00:15:29.420 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't have a
reason to hang around.

00:15:29.420 --> 00:15:32.670 align:middle line:84%
You've used it up by
staying in a positive state.

00:15:32.670 --> 00:15:33.470 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:15:33.470 --> 00:15:35.070 align:middle line:90%
>> Getting a benefit out of it.

00:15:35.070 --> 00:15:37.310 align:middle line:84%
So why does it
really matter what

00:15:37.310 --> 00:15:40.220 align:middle line:84%
happens if you know that
no matter what happens,

00:15:40.220 --> 00:15:43.970 align:middle line:84%
you can get a positive benefit
from it because it's not

00:15:43.970 --> 00:15:45.860 align:middle line:84%
about what happens,
it's about what

00:15:45.860 --> 00:15:48.110 align:middle line:84%
you do with what
happens that makes

00:15:48.110 --> 00:15:49.470 align:middle line:90%
the difference in your reality.

00:15:49.470 --> 00:15:50.270 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:15:50.270 --> 00:15:53.220 align:middle line:84%
>> Anything can happen and you
can make something positive out

00:15:53.220 --> 00:15:54.020 align:middle line:90%
of it.

00:15:54.020 --> 00:15:57.020 align:middle line:84%
Now I'm not saying
that you think

00:15:57.020 --> 00:15:59.330 align:middle line:90%
negative things are positive.

00:15:59.330 --> 00:16:01.280 align:middle line:84%
You can still observe
the difference

00:16:01.280 --> 00:16:02.810 align:middle line:90%
between positive and negative.

00:16:02.810 --> 00:16:05.420 align:middle line:84%
But I'm simply saying that, by
staying in a positive state,

00:16:05.420 --> 00:16:08.870 align:middle line:84%
knowing that it's there for
a reason that could serve you

00:16:08.870 --> 00:16:11.060 align:middle line:84%
if you stay in a
positive state, you'll

00:16:11.060 --> 00:16:15.080 align:middle line:84%
be able to discern what that
reason is and get a benefit

00:16:15.080 --> 00:16:18.080 align:middle line:84%
and learn a lesson from it
that will help you further down

00:16:18.080 --> 00:16:19.710 align:middle line:90%
the road.

00:16:19.710 --> 00:16:22.127 align:middle line:84%
Remember you cannot perceive
what you're not the vibration

00:16:22.127 --> 00:16:22.927 align:middle line:90%
of.

00:16:22.927 --> 00:16:24.800 align:middle line:84%
So if you go into
a negative state,

00:16:24.800 --> 00:16:28.730 align:middle line:84%
you won't be able to perceive
all the positive things that you

00:16:28.730 --> 00:16:31.250 align:middle line:84%
could get out of what
manifested because you're not

00:16:31.250 --> 00:16:33.030 align:middle line:90%
staying in a positive state.

00:16:33.030 --> 00:16:33.830 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:16:33.830 --> 00:16:35.900 align:middle line:84%
>> That's one of the
principles of the formula.

00:16:35.900 --> 00:16:39.350 align:middle line:84%
And this is what we mean by
you have to follow it precisely

00:16:39.350 --> 00:16:42.290 align:middle line:84%
so it will work
to your advantage.

00:16:42.290 --> 00:16:43.760 align:middle line:90%
Is this helping you?

00:16:43.760 --> 00:16:44.600 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:16:44.600 --> 00:16:45.660 align:middle line:90%
>> Are you sure?

00:16:45.660 --> 00:16:46.460 align:middle line:90%
>> For sure.

00:16:46.460 --> 00:16:47.120 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:16:47.120 --> 00:16:47.750 align:middle line:90%
>> All right.

00:16:47.750 --> 00:16:48.620 align:middle line:90%
>> Thank you.

00:16:48.620 --> 00:16:51.131 align:middle line:90%
>> You are welcome.

00:16:51.131 --> 00:16:54.470 align:middle line:90%
[APPLAUSE]

00:16:54.470 --> 00:16:57.340 align:middle line:90%


00:16:57.340 --> 00:16:58.330 align:middle line:90%
>> Hello, Bashar.

00:16:58.330 --> 00:17:00.730 align:middle line:90%
>> Good day.

00:17:00.730 --> 00:17:01.750 align:middle line:90%
>> I'm very old.

00:17:01.750 --> 00:17:02.260 align:middle line:90%
And--

00:17:02.260 --> 00:17:03.100 align:middle line:90%
>> You are what?

00:17:03.100 --> 00:17:04.030 align:middle line:90%
>> I'm very old.

00:17:04.030 --> 00:17:05.240 align:middle line:90%
>> You're very old?

00:17:05.240 --> 00:17:06.040 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:17:06.040 --> 00:17:07.210 align:middle line:90%
>> How old are you?

00:17:07.210 --> 00:17:08.680 align:middle line:90%
>> Many lifetimes old.

00:17:08.680 --> 00:17:11.690 align:middle line:84%
>> Oh, you're talking about
the idea of being an old soul.

00:17:11.690 --> 00:17:12.490 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:17:12.490 --> 00:17:12.760 align:middle line:90%
>> All right.

00:17:12.760 --> 00:17:15.430 align:middle line:84%
Well, you understand an old
soul is simply a soul that's

00:17:15.430 --> 00:17:17.260 align:middle line:90%
experienced in a certain way.

00:17:17.260 --> 00:17:21.150 align:middle line:90%
All souls are the same age.

00:17:21.150 --> 00:17:22.990 align:middle line:90%
Do you understand that?

00:17:22.990 --> 00:17:23.790 align:middle line:90%
>> No.

00:17:23.790 --> 00:17:25.440 align:middle line:90%
>> All souls are eternal.

00:17:25.440 --> 00:17:27.690 align:middle line:90%
All souls have always existed.

00:17:27.690 --> 00:17:29.940 align:middle line:84%
There is no beginning,
there is no ending.

00:17:29.940 --> 00:17:31.600 align:middle line:90%
It's outside of time.

00:17:31.600 --> 00:17:35.070 align:middle line:84%
When somebody talks about the
idea of being an old soul,

00:17:35.070 --> 00:17:37.560 align:middle line:84%
they're talking about
having a lot of experiences

00:17:37.560 --> 00:17:40.950 align:middle line:84%
in one particular realm, one
particular kind of experience,

00:17:40.950 --> 00:17:44.610 align:middle line:84%
like, maybe experiencing
many different incarnations

00:17:44.610 --> 00:17:46.890 align:middle line:84%
just on Earth as
opposed to someone

00:17:46.890 --> 00:17:49.830 align:middle line:84%
who might be experiencing their
first incarnation on Earth.

00:17:49.830 --> 00:17:51.690 align:middle line:84%
So the one with a
lot of experience

00:17:51.690 --> 00:17:53.610 align:middle line:84%
would be considered
an older soul

00:17:53.610 --> 00:17:55.590 align:middle line:90%
to the one with less experience.

00:17:55.590 --> 00:18:01.910 align:middle line:84%
But as an actual soul, all souls
are exactly the same, timeless.

00:18:01.910 --> 00:18:02.785 align:middle line:90%
Does that make sense?

00:18:02.785 --> 00:18:03.585 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:18:03.585 --> 00:18:06.260 align:middle line:84%
>> So you're talking about
an amount of experience

00:18:06.260 --> 00:18:10.140 align:middle line:84%
in a certain context when you
call yourself an old soul.

00:18:10.140 --> 00:18:15.470 align:middle line:84%
>> So in those higher souls,
does each higher soul have

00:18:15.470 --> 00:18:17.520 align:middle line:90%
a higher self here?

00:18:17.520 --> 00:18:21.460 align:middle line:84%
>> What are you referring
to as a higher soul?

00:18:21.460 --> 00:18:24.430 align:middle line:84%
Because sometimes the
terminology on your planet

00:18:24.430 --> 00:18:27.100 align:middle line:90%
can be a little confusing.

00:18:27.100 --> 00:18:29.950 align:middle line:84%
>> For example, in
this lifetime here.

00:18:29.950 --> 00:18:30.750 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:18:30.750 --> 00:18:32.760 align:middle line:90%
>> I have a higher self now.

00:18:32.760 --> 00:18:34.200 align:middle line:90%
>> You have a higher mind, yes.

00:18:34.200 --> 00:18:35.000 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:18:35.000 --> 00:18:37.300 align:middle line:84%
But there's other
mes from the other--

00:18:37.300 --> 00:18:38.970 align:middle line:84%
>> They each have
their own higher mind

00:18:38.970 --> 00:18:40.060 align:middle line:90%
if they're an incarnation.

00:18:40.060 --> 00:18:40.860 align:middle line:90%
>> Right?

00:18:40.860 --> 00:18:43.220 align:middle line:84%
So do they also
have a higher self?

00:18:43.220 --> 00:18:44.020 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:18:44.020 --> 00:18:45.430 align:middle line:90%
I just said so.

00:18:45.430 --> 00:18:48.580 align:middle line:84%
All incarnations have
their own higher self.

00:18:48.580 --> 00:18:52.450 align:middle line:84%
A soul, in a sense, when it's
going to have an incarnation,

00:18:52.450 --> 00:18:55.390 align:middle line:84%
retains a part of itself
in non-physical reality

00:18:55.390 --> 00:18:57.610 align:middle line:84%
and projects a part
of its consciousness

00:18:57.610 --> 00:19:00.910 align:middle line:84%
into the idea of the
physical reality experience

00:19:00.910 --> 00:19:02.800 align:middle line:84%
so that the
non-physical part acts

00:19:02.800 --> 00:19:04.940 align:middle line:84%
as a guide for
the physical part.

00:19:04.940 --> 00:19:09.370 align:middle line:84%
So every incarnation has a soul
that is the higher mind part.

00:19:09.370 --> 00:19:11.920 align:middle line:84%
Now above and
beyond that is what

00:19:11.920 --> 00:19:14.020 align:middle line:90%
we refer to as the oversoul.

00:19:14.020 --> 00:19:15.670 align:middle line:90%
Do you understand that concept?

00:19:15.670 --> 00:19:16.470 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:19:16.470 --> 00:19:21.220 align:middle line:84%
So when I communicate with the
higher soul and the oversouls--

00:19:21.220 --> 00:19:22.090 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:19:22.090 --> 00:19:23.270 align:middle line:90%
>> That's possible?

00:19:23.270 --> 00:19:24.070 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:19:24.070 --> 00:19:24.610 align:middle line:90%
Of course.

00:19:24.610 --> 00:19:25.410 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:19:25.410 --> 00:19:26.480 align:middle line:90%
>> Does that make sense?

00:19:26.480 --> 00:19:27.280 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:19:27.280 --> 00:19:28.080 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:19:28.080 --> 00:19:29.556 align:middle line:90%
>> You're welcome.

00:19:29.556 --> 00:19:33.320 align:middle line:10%
[APPLAUSE]

00:19:33.320 --> 00:19:34.120 align:middle line:90%
>> Hi, Bashar.

00:19:34.120 --> 00:19:35.500 align:middle line:90%
>> And to you, good day.

00:19:35.500 --> 00:19:39.550 align:middle line:84%
>> So you've referred to
2023 as a year of breakups

00:19:39.550 --> 00:19:40.480 align:middle line:90%
and shake-ups.

00:19:40.480 --> 00:19:41.280 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:19:41.280 --> 00:19:47.860 align:middle line:84%
>> And I was wondering if you
had a 2024-2025 themes that you

00:19:47.860 --> 00:19:51.160 align:middle line:84%
can share with us
and tell us how--

00:19:51.160 --> 00:19:52.850 align:middle line:90%
>> Integration.

00:19:52.850 --> 00:19:56.340 align:middle line:10%
Integration and ascension.

00:19:56.340 --> 00:19:58.540 align:middle line:90%
>> Is that for 2024 or is that--

00:19:58.540 --> 00:20:00.820 align:middle line:90%
>> Integration, 2024.

00:20:00.820 --> 00:20:03.130 align:middle line:90%
2025, ascension.

00:20:03.130 --> 00:20:05.560 align:middle line:84%
So that, again, it's
all about the idea

00:20:05.560 --> 00:20:08.680 align:middle line:84%
of de-compartmentalizing
yourself, getting

00:20:08.680 --> 00:20:10.175 align:middle line:84%
in touch with all
of those things

00:20:10.175 --> 00:20:11.800 align:middle line:84%
and integrating them
within your being,

00:20:11.800 --> 00:20:16.490 align:middle line:84%
not being afraid to do so,
acting as a more holistic being.

00:20:16.490 --> 00:20:19.360 align:middle line:84%
And then raising
your vibration, 2025,

00:20:19.360 --> 00:20:22.450 align:middle line:84%
to be more vibrationally
compatible with the idea

00:20:22.450 --> 00:20:25.350 align:middle line:90%
of going into open contact.

00:20:25.350 --> 00:20:26.250 align:middle line:90%
>> Thank you.

00:20:26.250 --> 00:20:27.050 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:20:27.050 --> 00:20:30.600 align:middle line:84%
>> You've talked about the
element of water being important

00:20:30.600 --> 00:20:35.080 align:middle line:84%
on Earth and an important
part of our spiritual process.

00:20:35.080 --> 00:20:35.880 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:20:35.880 --> 00:20:38.280 align:middle line:84%
It's the physical
translation of the transfer

00:20:38.280 --> 00:20:40.740 align:middle line:84%
of energy in very
specific ways that

00:20:40.740 --> 00:20:44.670 align:middle line:84%
allow you to maintain vitality
in your physical experience.

00:20:44.670 --> 00:20:48.390 align:middle line:84%
Obviously, you are
mostly made of water.

00:20:48.390 --> 00:20:51.900 align:middle line:84%
>> Are there any ways that
humans on Earth transmute

00:20:51.900 --> 00:20:55.080 align:middle line:84%
and work with water that's
different or unique from

00:20:55.080 --> 00:20:56.800 align:middle line:90%
the rest of the galaxy?

00:20:56.800 --> 00:20:57.600 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:20:57.600 --> 00:20:58.400 align:middle line:90%
Of course.

00:20:58.400 --> 00:21:01.020 align:middle line:84%
Because you are unique from
the rest of the galaxy.

00:21:01.020 --> 00:21:03.660 align:middle line:84%
Just like any other being
is unique from the rest

00:21:03.660 --> 00:21:06.450 align:middle line:84%
of the galaxy, and the
universe, and the multiverse.

00:21:06.450 --> 00:21:08.700 align:middle line:84%
So you have your own
ways of understanding

00:21:08.700 --> 00:21:11.070 align:middle line:84%
that based on your
physical experience.

00:21:11.070 --> 00:21:14.010 align:middle line:84%
But primarily, it's all
about, in your reality,

00:21:14.010 --> 00:21:16.470 align:middle line:84%
the idea of oxygen.
It's the idea

00:21:16.470 --> 00:21:20.500 align:middle line:84%
of breathing, deep breathing,
deep oxygenation of the system.

00:21:20.500 --> 00:21:23.730 align:middle line:84%
Remember that most of
your reality is polluted.

00:21:23.730 --> 00:21:26.520 align:middle line:84%
Most of your cells
have toxins in them.

00:21:26.520 --> 00:21:29.130 align:middle line:84%
So it's the idea of
purging those toxins

00:21:29.130 --> 00:21:32.740 align:middle line:84%
and infusing the system
with more oxygenation

00:21:32.740 --> 00:21:36.630 align:middle line:84%
so that nutrients can be held
into the cellular structure

00:21:36.630 --> 00:21:38.730 align:middle line:90%
and heal just about anything.

00:21:38.730 --> 00:21:41.160 align:middle line:84%
You're going to find
the vibration of oxygen

00:21:41.160 --> 00:21:46.230 align:middle line:84%
itself is going to be the key to
many future medical applications

00:21:46.230 --> 00:21:47.190 align:middle line:90%
on your planet.

00:21:47.190 --> 00:21:49.780 align:middle line:84%
The vibrational
frequency of oxygen,

00:21:49.780 --> 00:21:53.220 align:middle line:84%
not the oxygen necessarily
but the vibrational frequency

00:21:53.220 --> 00:21:55.890 align:middle line:90%
of oxygen is the key.

00:21:55.890 --> 00:21:57.460 align:middle line:90%
>> It's the Hertz of oxygen.

00:21:57.460 --> 00:21:58.260 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:21:58.260 --> 00:21:59.510 align:middle line:90%
>> What's the frequency of it?

00:21:59.510 --> 00:22:00.390 align:middle line:90%
>> You'll find out.

00:22:00.390 --> 00:22:02.160 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:22:02.160 --> 00:22:03.480 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:22:03.480 --> 00:22:07.080 align:middle line:84%
My last question is, in
regards to sanctuaries

00:22:07.080 --> 00:22:08.310 align:middle line:90%
for hybrid children--

00:22:08.310 --> 00:22:09.210 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:22:09.210 --> 00:22:11.760 align:middle line:84%
>> What are the key
characteristics that people that

00:22:11.760 --> 00:22:14.500 align:middle line:84%
would like to develop them
keep in mind when putting them

00:22:14.500 --> 00:22:15.300 align:middle line:90%
together?

00:22:15.300 --> 00:22:17.500 align:middle line:84%
Is there a certain size
that's appropriate?

00:22:17.500 --> 00:22:19.345 align:middle line:84%
Is there certain types
of characteristics

00:22:19.345 --> 00:22:20.220 align:middle line:90%
that are appropriate?

00:22:20.220 --> 00:22:24.330 align:middle line:84%
>> Something in nature,
remote from the cities so that

00:22:24.330 --> 00:22:26.280 align:middle line:84%
the hybrid children
can relate to nature,

00:22:26.280 --> 00:22:29.160 align:middle line:84%
which is the way that
they usually operate,

00:22:29.160 --> 00:22:33.270 align:middle line:84%
something that is a protected
sanctuary that allows hybrid

00:22:33.270 --> 00:22:37.150 align:middle line:84%
and human interaction to take
place in controlled situations

00:22:37.150 --> 00:22:39.520 align:middle line:84%
so that you can get
used to each other,

00:22:39.520 --> 00:22:44.260 align:middle line:84%
so that you can learn from each
other in a relatively simple,

00:22:44.260 --> 00:22:45.940 align:middle line:90%
safe environment.

00:22:45.940 --> 00:22:48.780 align:middle line:84%
So it's going to be important
for those communities

00:22:48.780 --> 00:22:51.930 align:middle line:84%
to be relatively small,
probably not more than about

00:22:51.930 --> 00:22:55.663 align:middle line:90%
300 individuals on average.

00:22:55.663 --> 00:22:56.580 align:middle line:90%
>> I love you, Bashar.

00:22:56.580 --> 00:22:57.413 align:middle line:90%
Thank you very much.

00:22:57.413 --> 00:22:59.876 align:middle line:84%
>> Our unconditional
love to you as well.

00:22:59.876 --> 00:23:03.208 align:middle line:90%
[APPLAUSE]

00:23:03.208 --> 00:23:05.590 align:middle line:90%


00:23:05.590 --> 00:23:06.400 align:middle line:90%
>> Hello, Bashar.

00:23:06.400 --> 00:23:08.200 align:middle line:90%
>> And to you, good day.

00:23:08.200 --> 00:23:10.300 align:middle line:84%
>> It is such a
pleasure to meet you.

00:23:10.300 --> 00:23:11.950 align:middle line:90%
>> And you as well.

00:23:11.950 --> 00:23:13.450 align:middle line:90%
>> I'm absolutely honored.

00:23:13.450 --> 00:23:16.160 align:middle line:90%
OK, so I have a few questions.

00:23:16.160 --> 00:23:17.860 align:middle line:84%
>> We will see how
many you get through.

00:23:17.860 --> 00:23:19.000 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:23:19.000 --> 00:23:22.220 align:middle line:90%
>> OK, I'll try to be quick.

00:23:22.220 --> 00:23:28.270 align:middle line:84%
So my mother told me she
had a near-death experience,

00:23:28.270 --> 00:23:30.500 align:middle line:84%
she left her body and came
back at the age of 22.

00:23:30.500 --> 00:23:31.300 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:23:31.300 --> 00:23:34.510 align:middle line:84%
>> And I had an experience where
I left my body and came back

00:23:34.510 --> 00:23:36.050 align:middle line:90%
at the age of 22 as well.

00:23:36.050 --> 00:23:39.970 align:middle line:84%
I was wondering what the
connection of that is.

00:23:39.970 --> 00:23:41.958 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, it travels
in family lines.

00:23:41.958 --> 00:23:43.750 align:middle line:84%
And you thought that
it would be a good way

00:23:43.750 --> 00:23:46.330 align:middle line:84%
to have your own experience
based on something you'd

00:23:46.330 --> 00:23:48.170 align:middle line:90%
been told had already happened.

00:23:48.170 --> 00:23:50.980 align:middle line:84%
So it made it easier for you
to transition at that time

00:23:50.980 --> 00:23:52.660 align:middle line:84%
because you believed
it was easier

00:23:52.660 --> 00:23:55.830 align:middle line:84%
to do it because of what
she had already done.

00:23:55.830 --> 00:23:56.630 align:middle line:90%
>> Wow.

00:23:56.630 --> 00:23:58.660 align:middle line:90%
That's very interesting.

00:23:58.660 --> 00:24:00.910 align:middle line:90%
>> Like mother, like daughter.

00:24:00.910 --> 00:24:03.130 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:24:03.130 --> 00:24:04.220 align:middle line:90%
And also--

00:24:04.220 --> 00:24:05.020 align:middle line:90%
>> One moment.

00:24:05.020 --> 00:24:05.820 align:middle line:90%
One moment.

00:24:05.820 --> 00:24:08.820 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:24:08.820 --> 00:24:12.120 align:middle line:84%
>> Vibrationally, the
double numbers are usually

00:24:12.120 --> 00:24:16.050 align:middle line:84%
representative of vibrational
gates that open up opportunities

00:24:16.050 --> 00:24:16.870 align:middle line:90%
for you.

00:24:16.870 --> 00:24:22.020 align:middle line:84%
So synchronistically, the 22
made it energetically easier

00:24:22.020 --> 00:24:24.540 align:middle line:84%
for you to penetrate
that barrier,

00:24:24.540 --> 00:24:27.780 align:middle line:84%
penetrate the physical
to non-physical veil that

00:24:27.780 --> 00:24:30.670 align:middle line:90%
exists in your belief systems.

00:24:30.670 --> 00:24:33.720 align:middle line:84%
So gates, in that
sense, as today,

00:24:33.720 --> 00:24:37.450 align:middle line:84%
in your terms 11-11
is a type of gate.

00:24:37.450 --> 00:24:42.040 align:middle line:84%
And by the way,
obviously, adds up to 22.

00:24:42.040 --> 00:24:44.800 align:middle line:90%
>> Wow.

00:24:44.800 --> 00:24:46.850 align:middle line:90%
>> That makes so much sense.

00:24:46.850 --> 00:24:47.650 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:24:47.650 --> 00:24:50.830 align:middle line:84%
So especially with
the experience

00:24:50.830 --> 00:24:53.860 align:middle line:84%
I had, leaving my body
and going back to source

00:24:53.860 --> 00:24:57.580 align:middle line:84%
and feeling that unconditional
love and wholeness

00:24:57.580 --> 00:24:58.450 align:middle line:90%
with everything--

00:24:58.450 --> 00:24:59.260 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:24:59.260 --> 00:25:01.150 align:middle line:90%
Do you still feel it?

00:25:01.150 --> 00:25:02.110 align:middle line:90%
>> I do.

00:25:02.110 --> 00:25:03.402 align:middle line:90%
I think about it and I feel it.

00:25:03.402 --> 00:25:04.202 align:middle line:90%
>> All right.

00:25:04.202 --> 00:25:05.350 align:middle line:90%
>> I feel connected to it.

00:25:05.350 --> 00:25:07.070 align:middle line:90%
>> That's exactly how it works.

00:25:07.070 --> 00:25:08.260 align:middle line:90%
That's the trick.

00:25:08.260 --> 00:25:14.030 align:middle line:84%
Again, remember this before you
go on, you cannot experience

00:25:14.030 --> 00:25:17.700 align:middle line:84%
what you're not the
vibration of already.

00:25:17.700 --> 00:25:19.860 align:middle line:90%
So here's the trick.

00:25:19.860 --> 00:25:24.470 align:middle line:84%
Anytime you can
remember a situation

00:25:24.470 --> 00:25:29.090 align:middle line:84%
where you were in a very high
vibration, feeling wonderful,

00:25:29.090 --> 00:25:32.180 align:middle line:84%
you actually have to
be in that vibration

00:25:32.180 --> 00:25:36.040 align:middle line:84%
in order to even
have the memory.

00:25:36.040 --> 00:25:37.510 align:middle line:90%
That's the trick.

00:25:37.510 --> 00:25:40.340 align:middle line:84%
You can't even remember
having been there

00:25:40.340 --> 00:25:42.910 align:middle line:84%
if you're not actually
in the frequency.

00:25:42.910 --> 00:25:46.120 align:middle line:84%
Even though it may feel
different because you're now

00:25:46.120 --> 00:25:49.570 align:middle line:84%
a different person and
translating that vibration

00:25:49.570 --> 00:25:52.330 align:middle line:84%
differently than
before doesn't mean

00:25:52.330 --> 00:25:54.350 align:middle line:90%
you're not in that frequency.

00:25:54.350 --> 00:25:56.620 align:middle line:84%
So the very fact
that you can remember

00:25:56.620 --> 00:26:00.850 align:middle line:84%
having been in that state
means you're in that state

00:26:00.850 --> 00:26:03.040 align:middle line:84%
again, in order to
have the memory.

00:26:03.040 --> 00:26:04.940 align:middle line:90%
That's the trick.

00:26:04.940 --> 00:26:07.350 align:middle line:90%
>> Wow.

00:26:07.350 --> 00:26:10.390 align:middle line:84%
It looks like you just answered
one of my other questions I

00:26:10.390 --> 00:26:12.460 align:middle line:90%
wanted to ask was because--

00:26:12.460 --> 00:26:14.360 align:middle line:90%
>> How synchronous of me.

00:26:14.360 --> 00:26:15.160 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:26:15.160 --> 00:26:17.290 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:26:17.290 --> 00:26:21.190 align:middle line:84%
I've been struggling with my
memory for a long time too.

00:26:21.190 --> 00:26:23.410 align:middle line:90%
And I've been wondering how to--

00:26:23.410 --> 00:26:25.300 align:middle line:90%
>> Struggling with your memory?

00:26:25.300 --> 00:26:29.310 align:middle line:84%
>> Trying to remember
the things from the past.

00:26:29.310 --> 00:26:30.110 align:middle line:90%
>> Why?

00:26:30.110 --> 00:26:30.910 align:middle line:90%
>> The past years.

00:26:30.910 --> 00:26:32.300 align:middle line:90%
>> Why?

00:26:32.300 --> 00:26:34.380 align:middle line:90%
Memory is created in the moment.

00:26:34.380 --> 00:26:35.180 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:26:35.180 --> 00:26:39.080 align:middle line:84%
>> You don't actually
have memories of the past.

00:26:39.080 --> 00:26:41.163 align:middle line:10%
You have memories
that you create

00:26:41.163 --> 00:26:42.830 align:middle line:10%
in the moment that
serve you that you're

00:26:42.830 --> 00:26:44.730 align:middle line:10%
calling memories of the past.

00:26:44.730 --> 00:26:47.300 align:middle line:10%
But remember, every time you
become a different person,

00:26:47.300 --> 00:26:50.240 align:middle line:10%
you change the past.

00:26:50.240 --> 00:26:51.990 align:middle line:84%
Do you all understand
that concept?

00:26:51.990 --> 00:26:52.790 align:middle line:90%
>> Wow.

00:26:52.790 --> 00:26:53.590 align:middle line:90%
That's--

00:26:53.590 --> 00:26:56.390 align:middle line:84%
>> Because the idea is,
from a linear perspective,

00:26:56.390 --> 00:26:59.750 align:middle line:84%
let's look at it this way,
if you truly have become

00:26:59.750 --> 00:27:03.360 align:middle line:84%
a different person,
linearly speaking,

00:27:03.360 --> 00:27:06.780 align:middle line:84%
you have to make sense of why
you're a different person.

00:27:06.780 --> 00:27:09.170 align:middle line:84%
So you have to have had
a different past that

00:27:09.170 --> 00:27:11.480 align:middle line:84%
makes sense for you to have
become the different person

00:27:11.480 --> 00:27:14.240 align:middle line:90%
you are now.

00:27:14.240 --> 00:27:16.700 align:middle line:84%
So being a different
person in the present

00:27:16.700 --> 00:27:19.070 align:middle line:84%
means you're actually
changing your past.

00:27:19.070 --> 00:27:23.420 align:middle line:84%
And anything you choose to
quote-unquote "remember"

00:27:23.420 --> 00:27:28.220 align:middle line:84%
of the past is something you're
creating now that you believe

00:27:28.220 --> 00:27:33.050 align:middle line:84%
you need to create now to help
you be whoever it is you need

00:27:33.050 --> 00:27:35.870 align:middle line:84%
to be to learn whatever
lessons you need to learn.

00:27:35.870 --> 00:27:38.450 align:middle line:84%
But you're creating that
memory in the present

00:27:38.450 --> 00:27:41.600 align:middle line:84%
because there's no
such thing as the past.

00:27:41.600 --> 00:27:42.400 align:middle line:90%
>> Wow.

00:27:42.400 --> 00:27:44.050 align:middle line:90%
That is fascinating.

00:27:44.050 --> 00:27:45.640 align:middle line:90%
And thank you so much.

00:27:45.640 --> 00:27:47.270 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:27:47.270 --> 00:27:49.520 align:middle line:84%
>> God knows, I was trying
to remember something else.

00:27:49.520 --> 00:27:52.090 align:middle line:90%
And I don't remember it.

00:27:52.090 --> 00:27:54.070 align:middle line:90%
>> That may be a good sign.

00:27:54.070 --> 00:27:56.380 align:middle line:90%
>> Probably.

00:27:56.380 --> 00:27:58.180 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:27:58.180 --> 00:27:59.770 align:middle line:90%
So this was--

00:27:59.770 --> 00:28:05.340 align:middle line:84%
>> And by the way, in our
society, we have no memory,

00:28:05.340 --> 00:28:06.850 align:middle line:90%
none whatsoever.

00:28:06.850 --> 00:28:08.970 align:middle line:84%
We just know that
we will know what

00:28:08.970 --> 00:28:12.172 align:middle line:84%
we need to know when
we need to know it.

00:28:12.172 --> 00:28:15.980 align:middle line:90%
[APPLAUSE]

00:28:15.980 --> 00:28:18.380 align:middle line:84%
Not a second before
we need to know it,

00:28:18.380 --> 00:28:20.780 align:middle line:84%
not a second later than
we need to know it.

00:28:20.780 --> 00:28:24.230 align:middle line:84%
So we don't actually
rely on memory at all.

00:28:24.230 --> 00:28:28.560 align:middle line:90%
We rely on knowingness.

00:28:28.560 --> 00:28:29.360 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:28:29.360 --> 00:28:30.290 align:middle line:90%
>> Does that help you?

00:28:30.290 --> 00:28:30.620 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:28:30.620 --> 00:28:31.520 align:middle line:90%
Thank you so much.

00:28:31.520 --> 00:28:32.330 align:middle line:90%
>> All right.

00:28:32.330 --> 00:28:33.788 align:middle line:84%
Can I have one more
quick question?

00:28:33.788 --> 00:28:35.330 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:28:35.330 --> 00:28:38.400 align:middle line:84%
>> So I'm single, and I'm
looking to expand my options.

00:28:38.400 --> 00:28:39.200 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:28:39.200 --> 00:28:40.520 align:middle line:90%
You are a single being.

00:28:40.520 --> 00:28:41.630 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:28:41.630 --> 00:28:43.430 align:middle line:90%
>> Is that what you meant?

00:28:43.430 --> 00:28:46.580 align:middle line:84%
>> I was wondering if you could
play matchmaker and pair me up

00:28:46.580 --> 00:28:48.902 align:middle line:90%
with a date with an alien.

00:28:48.902 --> 00:28:51.730 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:28:51.730 --> 00:28:55.930 align:middle line:84%
>> When you believe that you
are the person you need to be,

00:28:55.930 --> 00:28:59.710 align:middle line:84%
then you will be able to attract
anyone else to reflect that

00:28:59.710 --> 00:29:01.030 align:middle line:90%
to you.

00:29:01.030 --> 00:29:02.330 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:29:02.330 --> 00:29:03.130 align:middle line:90%
Thank you so much.

00:29:03.130 --> 00:29:06.770 align:middle line:90%


00:29:06.770 --> 00:29:07.570 align:middle line:90%
>> Bashar.

00:29:07.570 --> 00:29:11.210 align:middle line:84%
