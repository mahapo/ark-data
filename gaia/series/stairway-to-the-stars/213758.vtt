00:00:11.295 --> 00:00:12.420 align:middle line:90%
>>TIMOTHY HOGAN: Excellent.

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:17.180 align:middle line:10%
I'm going to be talking about
stuff related to the Knights

00:00:17.180 --> 00:00:20.600 align:middle line:10%
Templar and Egypt and
some of the discoveries

00:00:20.600 --> 00:00:25.130 align:middle line:10%
that they found in Egypt,
also other places that

00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:28.497 align:middle line:10%
had a huge influence on
what they were doing.

00:00:28.497 --> 00:00:30.830 align:middle line:84%
I'm not going to get into all
the history of the Knights

00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:35.300 align:middle line:84%
Templar and their background
and their persecution

00:00:35.300 --> 00:00:36.510 align:middle line:90%
and any of that stuff.

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:39.480 align:middle line:84%
But I'm going to
give you a summary,

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:41.090 align:middle line:84%
basically, at first
just saying that,

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:45.050 align:middle line:84%
look, the Knights Templar
were established--

00:00:45.050 --> 00:00:46.820 align:middle line:84%
according to
standard historians,

00:00:46.820 --> 00:00:49.220 align:middle line:90%
they were established in 1118.

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:52.310 align:middle line:84%
Privately, the
order was actually

00:00:52.310 --> 00:00:55.160 align:middle line:90%
established as early as 1096.

00:00:55.160 --> 00:01:00.860 align:middle line:84%
And the people who set it up
came from certain families that

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:03.930 align:middle line:90%
were passing down traditions.

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:08.480 align:middle line:84%
They largely came from
Gnostic Albigensian families.

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:11.540 align:middle line:84%
Though Hugues de Payens, who
was the first grandmaster

00:01:11.540 --> 00:01:13.430 align:middle line:84%
of the Knights Templar,
he had actually

00:01:13.430 --> 00:01:18.270 align:middle line:84%
come from an Islamic
Sufi background.

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:23.880 align:middle line:84%
And they had a lot of
influence at the beginning

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:28.050 align:middle line:84%
from Jewish
Kabbalistic traditions,

00:01:28.050 --> 00:01:30.420 align:middle line:90%
different Gnostic traditions.

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:34.740 align:middle line:84%
There were certain Scottish
traditions and Druid traditions

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:40.690 align:middle line:84%
that had all contributed to
the formation of this order.

00:01:40.690 --> 00:01:46.770 align:middle line:84%
And though the order is usually
associated with the Crusades

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:49.820 align:middle line:90%
and with--

00:01:49.820 --> 00:01:54.980 align:middle line:84%
most people think of it as
being a Roman Catholic army.

00:01:54.980 --> 00:02:00.920 align:middle line:84%
Even though the Templars did use
the Roman Church for patronage

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:05.030 align:middle line:84%
for about 200 years,
privately they

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:07.490 align:middle line:84%
continued to pass on
an esoteric doctrine

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:10.350 align:middle line:84%
that they had inherited
through their family lines.

00:02:10.350 --> 00:02:15.050 align:middle line:84%
And the real reason
why they were set up--

00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:17.870 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it was said
that they were set up

00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:21.440 align:middle line:84%
to protect pilgrims
in the Holy Land

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:23.730 align:middle line:90%
during the time of the Crusades.

00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:26.870 align:middle line:84%
But in reality, they were--
they're doing archaeology.

00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:28.310 align:middle line:90%
And they were doing research.

00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:29.360 align:middle line:90%
They were digging.

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:31.830 align:middle line:84%
And they were looking
for certain artifacts.

00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:35.870 align:middle line:84%
And the reason why they were
looking for them is, one,

00:02:35.870 --> 00:02:38.710 align:middle line:90%
they were concerned that if--

00:02:38.710 --> 00:02:41.260 align:middle line:84%
they knew the Crusades
would get out of control.

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:46.505 align:middle line:84%
And as Crusaders found
some of this stuff,

00:02:46.505 --> 00:02:48.880 align:middle line:84%
it would get turned over to
the Roman Church at the time.

00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:50.400 align:middle line:90%
And then it would disappear.

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:52.100 align:middle line:84%
So they didn't want
that to happen.

00:02:52.100 --> 00:02:56.080 align:middle line:84%
They wanted to actually find
certain artifacts that they

00:02:56.080 --> 00:02:59.544 align:middle line:90%
knew existed in the Holy Land.

00:02:59.544 --> 00:03:01.690 align:middle line:84%
But even beyond
that, their mission

00:03:01.690 --> 00:03:07.070 align:middle line:90%
was more concerned with--

00:03:07.070 --> 00:03:15.010 align:middle line:84%
they knew from both their family
lines and from other traditions

00:03:15.010 --> 00:03:18.580 align:middle line:84%
that they were associated
with prior to 1118,

00:03:18.580 --> 00:03:20.530 align:middle line:84%
that there was
probably something

00:03:20.530 --> 00:03:23.570 align:middle line:90%
to the flood myth in antiquity.

00:03:23.570 --> 00:03:25.180 align:middle line:90%
They looked to the Bible.

00:03:25.180 --> 00:03:26.590 align:middle line:90%
They looked to the Torah.

00:03:26.590 --> 00:03:29.710 align:middle line:84%
And they saw the story
of Noah's Ark, which

00:03:29.710 --> 00:03:33.630 align:middle line:84%
was the only thing
in Europe at the time

00:03:33.630 --> 00:03:35.350 align:middle line:84%
that they could
primarily look to.

00:03:35.350 --> 00:03:38.070 align:middle line:84%
But they had associations
with other groups

00:03:38.070 --> 00:03:41.910 align:middle line:84%
and other places that also
had these flood myths.

00:03:41.910 --> 00:03:43.410 align:middle line:84%
And so they knew
there was something

00:03:43.410 --> 00:03:46.210 align:middle line:90%
to the flood myths, number one.

00:03:46.210 --> 00:03:49.710 align:middle line:84%
And number two, they
believed that there

00:03:49.710 --> 00:03:55.830 align:middle line:84%
was a high civilization that
had existed prior to the flood

00:03:55.830 --> 00:04:02.100 align:middle line:84%
and that this high civilization
had passed on philosophy

00:04:02.100 --> 00:04:07.930 align:middle line:84%
and technology to
different groups

00:04:07.930 --> 00:04:12.130 align:middle line:84%
after the collapse of
this high civilization.

00:04:12.130 --> 00:04:16.269 align:middle line:84%
And this is, of course, we now
recognize as being associated

00:04:16.269 --> 00:04:17.829 align:middle line:90%
with the Atlantis myth.

00:04:17.829 --> 00:04:21.490 align:middle line:84%
But we have to remember, during
the time of the templars,

00:04:21.490 --> 00:04:26.650 align:middle line:84%
all those texts of Plato and
the other Greek philosophers

00:04:26.650 --> 00:04:31.060 align:middle line:84%
and the texts of people
like Pythagoras and others,

00:04:31.060 --> 00:04:33.980 align:middle line:84%
these were just starting
to be translated.

00:04:33.980 --> 00:04:37.060 align:middle line:10%
They were just starting to--

00:04:37.060 --> 00:04:39.580 align:middle line:10%
there were certain
groups, like the Druze--

00:04:39.580 --> 00:04:43.990 align:middle line:10%
the Tawhid Muwahhidun Druze of
the Middle East and the Sabians

00:04:43.990 --> 00:04:50.230 align:middle line:10%
and others in the Middle East,
who were attaining these texts

00:04:50.230 --> 00:04:52.540 align:middle line:10%
and were translating them.

00:04:52.540 --> 00:04:54.310 align:middle line:84%
There were other
Islamic groups that

00:04:54.310 --> 00:04:56.470 align:middle line:90%
were translating these texts.

00:04:56.470 --> 00:04:59.740 align:middle line:84%
And the Templars,
their mission was

00:04:59.740 --> 00:05:03.310 align:middle line:84%
to go out and seek out
all the groups that

00:05:03.310 --> 00:05:09.320 align:middle line:84%
was believed to be
survivors of that cataclysm.

00:05:09.320 --> 00:05:14.570 align:middle line:84%
It was believed that after that
high civilization had collapsed,

00:05:14.570 --> 00:05:16.490 align:middle line:90%
it had spread out.

00:05:16.490 --> 00:05:21.230 align:middle line:84%
And it had set up
outposts, if you will,

00:05:21.230 --> 00:05:24.320 align:middle line:84%
in different parts around
Europe, the Middle East, Africa,

00:05:24.320 --> 00:05:25.950 align:middle line:90%
and other places.

00:05:25.950 --> 00:05:29.810 align:middle line:84%
And so the Templars wanted
to seek out these traditions

00:05:29.810 --> 00:05:33.740 align:middle line:90%
to find what they had preserved.

00:05:33.740 --> 00:05:38.600 align:middle line:84%
So even though most people think
of them as primarily existing

00:05:38.600 --> 00:05:45.110 align:middle line:84%
in Europe and in Jerusalem,
maybe in Constantinople,

00:05:45.110 --> 00:05:48.500 align:middle line:84%
the Templars actually spread
out all over the place

00:05:48.500 --> 00:05:51.260 align:middle line:84%
because they were looking
for this last knowledge.

00:05:51.260 --> 00:05:59.960 align:middle line:84%
And they knew that if they
could re-find it and bring it

00:05:59.960 --> 00:06:03.680 align:middle line:84%
back to Europe, that it would
bring about a new Renaissance.

00:06:03.680 --> 00:06:05.400 align:middle line:90%
And that was their goal.

00:06:05.400 --> 00:06:09.730 align:middle line:84%
And in fact, that worked
out for the most part.

00:06:09.730 --> 00:06:13.160 align:middle line:90%


00:06:13.160 --> 00:06:17.210 align:middle line:84%
By 1307, the Templars
were suppressed.

00:06:17.210 --> 00:06:20.750 align:middle line:84%
By 1314, the grand
master and several others

00:06:20.750 --> 00:06:23.010 align:middle line:90%
were burnt at the stake.

00:06:23.010 --> 00:06:25.550 align:middle line:84%
And most people think that was
the end of the Templar order.

00:06:25.550 --> 00:06:27.550 align:middle line:90%
But it actually wasn't.

00:06:27.550 --> 00:06:30.500 align:middle line:84%
It just went underground
and continued to exist.

00:06:30.500 --> 00:06:32.480 align:middle line:84%
Scott Wolter, who's
in the audience,

00:06:32.480 --> 00:06:37.090 align:middle line:84%
will be speaking more on some of
that at the next presentation,

00:06:37.090 --> 00:06:37.890 align:middle line:90%
after this one.

00:06:37.890 --> 00:06:41.830 align:middle line:84%
So I hope you stick around
after this for that.

00:06:41.830 --> 00:06:44.530 align:middle line:84%
So what I'm going to
focus on today primarily

00:06:44.530 --> 00:06:49.510 align:middle line:84%
is we're going to look at some
of the cultures and traditions

00:06:49.510 --> 00:06:51.670 align:middle line:84%
that the Templars
were associated with

00:06:51.670 --> 00:06:55.150 align:middle line:84%
and, in particular, some of
what they were finding in Egypt

00:06:55.150 --> 00:06:57.280 align:middle line:84%
because most people don't
realize because no one's

00:06:57.280 --> 00:06:58.340 align:middle line:90%
ever written about it--

00:06:58.340 --> 00:07:00.850 align:middle line:84%
I'm actually writing a
book about it right now--

00:07:00.850 --> 00:07:06.440 align:middle line:84%
that the Templars spent
a lot of time in Egypt.

00:07:06.440 --> 00:07:09.760 align:middle line:84%
They set up preceptories
and commanderies

00:07:09.760 --> 00:07:13.030 align:middle line:84%
all throughout
Egypt because they

00:07:13.030 --> 00:07:15.140 align:middle line:90%
were studying the temple walls.

00:07:15.140 --> 00:07:21.940 align:middle line:84%
They were looking for evidence
of this lost civilization.

00:07:21.940 --> 00:07:23.390 align:middle line:90%
And they found it.

00:07:23.390 --> 00:07:25.940 align:middle line:84%
And then they also were trying
to find some of the sciences.

00:07:25.940 --> 00:07:31.000 align:middle line:84%
And one of the main sciences
that they came to realize

00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:35.510 align:middle line:84%
was alchemy, the
science of alchemy.

00:07:35.510 --> 00:07:36.960 align:middle line:90%
We'll get into this more.

00:07:36.960 --> 00:07:42.890 align:middle line:84%
But alchemy-- just as a
general summary, alchemy

00:07:42.890 --> 00:07:45.440 align:middle line:90%
is the science of transmutation.

00:07:45.440 --> 00:07:49.860 align:middle line:84%
It is the precursor
to chemistry.

00:07:49.860 --> 00:07:53.210 align:middle line:84%
In fact, the word chemistry
comes from alchemistry.

00:07:53.210 --> 00:07:58.380 align:middle line:84%
And alchemy gets its name
literally from Chem or Kemet,

00:07:58.380 --> 00:08:00.930 align:middle line:84%
which was the ancient
name for Egypt.

00:08:00.930 --> 00:08:04.650 align:middle line:84%
And most people, when they think
of alchemy and the alchemists,

00:08:04.650 --> 00:08:09.030 align:middle line:84%
they think of these alchemical
philosophers who are writing

00:08:09.030 --> 00:08:16.530 align:middle line:84%
on the subject in the 1400s,
1500s, and 1600s primarily.

00:08:16.530 --> 00:08:21.720 align:middle line:84%
People with names like Michael
Maier, Thomas Vaughan, Robert

00:08:21.720 --> 00:08:26.820 align:middle line:84%
Fludd, even Isaac Newton
was obsessed with alchemy.

00:08:26.820 --> 00:08:36.929 align:middle line:84%
But these writers of the 1500s
and 1600s and even 1700s all

00:08:36.929 --> 00:08:41.669 align:middle line:84%
said that, look, this was a
science that came from Egypt.

00:08:41.669 --> 00:08:43.559 align:middle line:84%
They don't necessarily
talk about how

00:08:43.559 --> 00:08:47.100 align:middle line:84%
it was the Templars who
brought it up into Europe.

00:08:47.100 --> 00:08:49.415 align:middle line:90%
But the evidence is there.

00:08:49.415 --> 00:08:52.270 align:middle line:90%


00:08:52.270 --> 00:08:55.120 align:middle line:84%
So let's start getting into
some of the slides here.

00:08:55.120 --> 00:08:57.690 align:middle line:84%
This particular
image right here,

00:08:57.690 --> 00:09:01.080 align:middle line:84%
these are actually
images of initiations

00:09:01.080 --> 00:09:05.730 align:middle line:84%
that the Templar order continues
to do within the Great Pyramid

00:09:05.730 --> 00:09:06.870 align:middle line:90%
of Egypt.

00:09:06.870 --> 00:09:11.250 align:middle line:84%
And we've been doing that for
over the last 1,000 years pretty

00:09:11.250 --> 00:09:13.561 align:middle line:90%
regularly.

00:09:13.561 --> 00:09:17.520 align:middle line:84%
But it goes back, all the
way back to the 1100s,

00:09:17.520 --> 00:09:19.630 align:middle line:90%
when the order was in there.

00:09:19.630 --> 00:09:22.710 align:middle line:84%
And in fact, there's even
graffiti in the Great Pyramid

00:09:22.710 --> 00:09:25.620 align:middle line:90%
to this day.

00:09:25.620 --> 00:09:29.520 align:middle line:84%
That so-called sarcophagus
within the King's Chamber

00:09:29.520 --> 00:09:32.280 align:middle line:90%
of the Great Pyramid is--

00:09:32.280 --> 00:09:36.760 align:middle line:84%
it actually has some
graffiti carved into it.

00:09:36.760 --> 00:09:40.060 align:middle line:84%
It has an alpha and an
omega symbol carved into it.

00:09:40.060 --> 00:09:42.780 align:middle line:84%
And that was by Templars,
clear back in the 1100s,

00:09:42.780 --> 00:09:44.560 align:middle line:84%
when they were doing
initiations in there.

00:09:44.560 --> 00:09:48.330 align:middle line:84%
So been doing it
for a long time.

00:09:48.330 --> 00:09:52.860 align:middle line:84%
The Templars were looking to
these ancient civilizations

00:09:52.860 --> 00:09:56.130 align:middle line:84%
that had been passing
on these flood myths.

00:09:56.130 --> 00:09:58.230 align:middle line:84%
So they went into
places not only

00:09:58.230 --> 00:10:02.790 align:middle line:84%
into Egypt and into
Jerusalem but also

00:10:02.790 --> 00:10:06.430 align:middle line:90%
into places like Iraq and Iran.

00:10:06.430 --> 00:10:08.430 align:middle line:84%
They were looking
at the Mesopotamian,

00:10:08.430 --> 00:10:13.570 align:middle line:90%
the Sumerian images.

00:10:13.570 --> 00:10:18.080 align:middle line:84%
Here, in particular, this
figure from ancient Sumer,

00:10:18.080 --> 00:10:22.420 align:middle line:84%
he's wearing what was to
become the Templar cross.

00:10:22.420 --> 00:10:24.310 align:middle line:84%
In fact, this is where
the Templars actually

00:10:24.310 --> 00:10:28.000 align:middle line:84%
got the symbol of the
equal armed cross from.

00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:31.150 align:middle line:84%
It wasn't something given
to them by the Roman Church.

00:10:31.150 --> 00:10:36.520 align:middle line:84%
It was actually-- they were
looking at these ancient myths

00:10:36.520 --> 00:10:42.490 align:middle line:84%
associated with the Anunnaki
and also the "Epic of Gilgamesh"

00:10:42.490 --> 00:10:45.820 align:middle line:84%
and the flood myths there
and the search for an elixir

00:10:45.820 --> 00:10:47.210 align:middle line:90%
of immortality.

00:10:47.210 --> 00:10:52.240 align:middle line:84%
That was the myth of the
Gilgamesh, which was--

00:10:52.240 --> 00:10:57.370 align:middle line:84%
in fact, they believed this was
part of this alchemical science.

00:10:57.370 --> 00:11:01.490 align:middle line:84%
They also looked to
the myths of Oannes.

00:11:01.490 --> 00:11:04.120 align:middle line:84%
And the story of
Oannes is that--

00:11:04.120 --> 00:11:07.000 align:middle line:84%
I mean, we have a couple
of depictions of Oannes

00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:15.150 align:middle line:84%
here with the fish skin, hat,
and holding the little bag.

00:11:15.150 --> 00:11:20.720 align:middle line:84%
Here's some more depictions of
Oannes from ancient Sumerian.

00:11:20.720 --> 00:11:26.510 align:middle line:84%
But Oannes, according
to the myths, Oannes,

00:11:26.510 --> 00:11:29.180 align:middle line:84%
came out of the ocean,
bringing the seeds

00:11:29.180 --> 00:11:31.170 align:middle line:90%
to rebuild civilization.

00:11:31.170 --> 00:11:36.130 align:middle line:84%
And he basically
baptized priests, kings,

00:11:36.130 --> 00:11:40.600 align:middle line:84%
and then taught them how to
set up civilization according

00:11:40.600 --> 00:11:42.220 align:middle line:90%
to the Sumerian myths.

00:11:42.220 --> 00:11:44.793 align:middle line:90%
Well, to the Templars--

00:11:44.793 --> 00:11:47.320 align:middle line:90%


00:11:47.320 --> 00:11:51.730 align:middle line:84%
they became quickly
aware of the fact

00:11:51.730 --> 00:11:57.730 align:middle line:84%
that the official feast
day of Oannes was June 24.

00:11:57.730 --> 00:12:01.450 align:middle line:10%
According to the pagan
calendar, June 24

00:12:01.450 --> 00:12:03.740 align:middle line:10%
was the feast day of Oannes.

00:12:03.740 --> 00:12:07.990 align:middle line:84%
And there was another person
who also had a feast day on June

00:12:07.990 --> 00:12:12.010 align:middle line:84%
24th, who also baptized
priests, kings,

00:12:12.010 --> 00:12:14.540 align:middle line:90%
and who had a very similar name.

00:12:14.540 --> 00:12:17.560 align:middle line:84%
And this was actually
John the Baptist.

00:12:17.560 --> 00:12:22.510 align:middle line:84%
And, in fact, in the myths of
John the Baptist or the stories

00:12:22.510 --> 00:12:27.640 align:middle line:84%
of John the baptist, the word
"John," as we in English,

00:12:27.640 --> 00:12:31.330 align:middle line:84%
actually comes from
Johannes in German,

00:12:31.330 --> 00:12:37.200 align:middle line:84%
which in turn traces
back to Ioannes in Greek.

00:12:37.200 --> 00:12:40.570 align:middle line:84%
So the Greek name
for John the Baptist,

00:12:40.570 --> 00:12:45.130 align:middle line:84%
which would have been the name
actually found in the Bible,

00:12:45.130 --> 00:12:47.260 align:middle line:90%
would be Ioannes.

00:12:47.260 --> 00:12:49.480 align:middle line:84%
So it's very
interesting that here we

00:12:49.480 --> 00:12:55.750 align:middle line:84%
have this figure, Ioannes,
who is baptizing priest kings

00:12:55.750 --> 00:12:58.970 align:middle line:90%
and whose feast day was June 24.

00:12:58.970 --> 00:13:03.130 align:middle line:84%
And this just happens to also
be the feast day of Oannes,

00:13:03.130 --> 00:13:05.280 align:middle line:90%
which was also June 24.

00:13:05.280 --> 00:13:07.990 align:middle line:84%
So the Templars
immediately recognized

00:13:07.990 --> 00:13:10.900 align:middle line:84%
in this story of
John the Baptist

00:13:10.900 --> 00:13:16.810 align:middle line:84%
that it was an echo or a shadow
of the earlier story of Oannes.

00:13:16.810 --> 00:13:20.050 align:middle line:84%
So this was, again, one of the
things that the Templars were

00:13:20.050 --> 00:13:23.170 align:middle line:90%
looking into.

00:13:23.170 --> 00:13:24.990 align:middle line:84%
Actually, Scott gave
me this picture.

00:13:24.990 --> 00:13:32.200 align:middle line:84%
This is a Templar graffiti
just outside of Gobekli Tepe.

00:13:32.200 --> 00:13:36.860 align:middle line:84%
And he's going to be
getting into this more.

00:13:36.860 --> 00:13:42.510 align:middle line:84%
But I point this out because
the area of Gobekli Tepe is--

00:13:42.510 --> 00:13:46.290 align:middle line:84%
and I hope everyone here
knows what Gobekli Tepe is,

00:13:46.290 --> 00:13:47.580 align:middle line:90%
I'm assuming.

00:13:47.580 --> 00:13:51.170 align:middle line:84%
This is a more educated audience
than some that I present to.

00:13:51.170 --> 00:13:55.520 align:middle line:90%


00:13:55.520 --> 00:13:59.570 align:middle line:84%
That whole area where Gobekli
Tepe is, is in the ancient times

00:13:59.570 --> 00:14:04.070 align:middle line:84%
was referred to as Harran,
this area in Turkey.

00:14:04.070 --> 00:14:12.400 align:middle line:84%
And Harran is actually the
foundation post, if you will,

00:14:12.400 --> 00:14:15.550 align:middle line:90%
of a group known as the Sabians.

00:14:15.550 --> 00:14:18.340 align:middle line:84%
And the Sabians is one of
these groups in the Middle East

00:14:18.340 --> 00:14:21.940 align:middle line:84%
that the Templars
were associating with.

00:14:21.940 --> 00:14:30.092 align:middle line:84%
And they were learning astronomy
and astrology from the Sabians,

00:14:30.092 --> 00:14:33.850 align:middle line:84%
they are in particular
are great astrologers,

00:14:33.850 --> 00:14:36.590 align:middle line:84%
but they were also
passing on alchemy.

00:14:36.590 --> 00:14:39.280 align:middle line:84%
To this day, there are
still Sabian groups,

00:14:39.280 --> 00:14:44.620 align:middle line:84%
and they actually visit the
Great Pyramid once a year

00:14:44.620 --> 00:14:49.060 align:middle line:84%
to check the alignment
of the Giza Plateau

00:14:49.060 --> 00:14:51.700 align:middle line:84%
with certain star
constellations.

00:14:51.700 --> 00:14:53.740 align:middle line:84%
They've been doing
this for centuries.

00:14:53.740 --> 00:14:58.780 align:middle line:84%
And the Sabians are also
mentioned in the Qur'an.

00:14:58.780 --> 00:15:01.270 align:middle line:84%
In fact, the Qur'an says
the people of the book are

00:15:01.270 --> 00:15:05.950 align:middle line:84%
the people that are acceptable
to God or Allah are the Jews,

00:15:05.950 --> 00:15:08.680 align:middle line:84%
the Christians, the
Muslims, and the Sabians.

00:15:08.680 --> 00:15:15.230 align:middle line:84%
And an interesting
backstory of the Sabians,

00:15:15.230 --> 00:15:17.970 align:middle line:84%
traditionally, they
were Hermeticists.

00:15:17.970 --> 00:15:21.170 align:middle line:84%
They worshipped
the god Hermes, who

00:15:21.170 --> 00:15:24.450 align:middle line:84%
was also said to be the
patron saint of alchemy.

00:15:24.450 --> 00:15:29.480 align:middle line:84%
And basically, when the Muslims
encountered them, they said.

00:15:29.480 --> 00:15:32.240 align:middle line:84%
well, you guys are
cool, but we can't have

00:15:32.240 --> 00:15:34.320 align:middle line:90%
you worshipping pagan idols.

00:15:34.320 --> 00:15:39.030 align:middle line:84%
And they said, OK, well, what
do you want us to do about it?

00:15:39.030 --> 00:15:45.060 align:middle line:84%
And the Muslims said, well,
just change it to Idris.

00:15:45.060 --> 00:15:47.930 align:middle line:90%
Idris is Hermes.

00:15:47.930 --> 00:15:50.810 align:middle line:84%
So we'll just say you're
worshipping Idris,

00:15:50.810 --> 00:15:52.320 align:middle line:90%
and then everything's cool.

00:15:52.320 --> 00:15:54.000 align:middle line:90%
And they were like, OK, cool.

00:15:54.000 --> 00:15:57.980 align:middle line:84%
So if you ever encounter
people in the Middle East

00:15:57.980 --> 00:16:01.970 align:middle line:84%
with the name of Idris,
there's a good possibility

00:16:01.970 --> 00:16:05.930 align:middle line:84%
they could be
Hermeticists or studying

00:16:05.930 --> 00:16:09.980 align:middle line:84%
the philosophy of
Hermes Trismegistus,

00:16:09.980 --> 00:16:14.660 align:middle line:84%
and they usually come
from a tradition that

00:16:14.660 --> 00:16:18.800 align:middle line:84%
is studying alchemy as well,
because again, Idris was

00:16:18.800 --> 00:16:20.160 align:middle line:90%
the patron saint of alchemy.

00:16:20.160 --> 00:16:24.020 align:middle line:84%
But my point is with this is
that the Templars went to that

00:16:24.020 --> 00:16:26.900 align:middle line:84%
area of Harran where
the Sabians were,

00:16:26.900 --> 00:16:32.040 align:middle line:84%
and they started encountering
what was around Gobekli Tepe I

00:16:32.040 --> 00:16:35.910 align:middle line:84%
mean, clear back in the
1100s, long before--

00:16:35.910 --> 00:16:38.050 align:middle line:84%
people are making all
excited about it today,

00:16:38.050 --> 00:16:43.430 align:middle line:84%
but this is some of that Templar
graffiti that's in that area.

00:16:43.430 --> 00:16:44.230 align:middle line:90%
All right.

00:16:44.230 --> 00:16:47.110 align:middle line:84%
So the Templars
went into Jerusalem.

00:16:47.110 --> 00:16:50.050 align:middle line:84%
They were digging
into the Temple Mount.

00:16:50.050 --> 00:16:51.820 align:middle line:90%
That's pretty well established.

00:16:51.820 --> 00:16:52.930 align:middle line:90%
People know about it.

00:16:52.930 --> 00:16:55.720 align:middle line:84%
But then they also
went into Egypt.

00:16:55.720 --> 00:17:00.760 align:middle line:84%
And what we have here, this
is actually the hieroglyph

00:17:00.760 --> 00:17:04.960 align:middle line:84%
for Chem or Kemet, the
ancient name for Egypt.

00:17:04.960 --> 00:17:10.170 align:middle line:84%
And I'm going to just quickly
go through some of these slides.

00:17:10.170 --> 00:17:13.200 align:middle line:84%
Part of what the Templars
discovered immediately in Egypt

00:17:13.200 --> 00:17:15.960 align:middle line:84%
was there is evidence
of technology

00:17:15.960 --> 00:17:17.470 align:middle line:90%
all over the place there.

00:17:17.470 --> 00:17:20.579 align:middle line:84%
It's just people aren't used
to looking at it that way.

00:17:20.579 --> 00:17:24.780 align:middle line:84%
For example, this is on a
Giza Plateau clear evidence

00:17:24.780 --> 00:17:32.045 align:middle line:84%
of machining marks, saw marks,
cutting into this granite.

00:17:32.045 --> 00:17:36.750 align:middle line:90%


00:17:36.750 --> 00:17:41.010 align:middle line:84%
Everyone's so excited
about the pyramids,

00:17:41.010 --> 00:17:44.290 align:middle line:84%
obviously, on the Giza
Plateau and the Sphinx.

00:17:44.290 --> 00:17:52.200 align:middle line:84%
But possibly, one of
the more amazing feats

00:17:52.200 --> 00:17:54.240 align:middle line:90%
that had been done--

00:17:54.240 --> 00:17:56.850 align:middle line:84%
and I'm not going to say
the Egyptians did it.

00:17:56.850 --> 00:17:59.320 align:middle line:84%
I believe the
Egyptians inherited it.

00:17:59.320 --> 00:18:02.160 align:middle line:84%
I'll show that more
as we go along.

00:18:02.160 --> 00:18:06.360 align:middle line:84%
But the actual plateau that
the pyramids were built on,

00:18:06.360 --> 00:18:11.760 align:middle line:84%
all of that was laid
out and sculpted,

00:18:11.760 --> 00:18:14.340 align:middle line:84%
and incredible
stonework and masonry

00:18:14.340 --> 00:18:19.230 align:middle line:84%
was put in to just clear
out and create the plateau

00:18:19.230 --> 00:18:20.410 align:middle line:90%
to begin with.

00:18:20.410 --> 00:18:21.690 align:middle line:90%
And you'll find things in it.

00:18:21.690 --> 00:18:24.850 align:middle line:84%
Like here's a stone
on the plateau.

00:18:24.850 --> 00:18:33.370 align:middle line:84%
It has one, two, three, four,
five, six, seven, eight,

00:18:33.370 --> 00:18:34.770 align:middle line:90%
eight angles to it.

00:18:34.770 --> 00:18:37.740 align:middle line:84%
And it fits perfectly
just like a jigsaw puzzle.

00:18:37.740 --> 00:18:41.340 align:middle line:84%
And that whole
plateau is that way.

00:18:41.340 --> 00:18:44.450 align:middle line:84%
And it's reminiscent
of things that you'll

00:18:44.450 --> 00:18:48.410 align:middle line:84%
see in Peru, for
example, at places

00:18:48.410 --> 00:18:54.930 align:middle line:84%
like Saqsaywaman
and other places

00:18:54.930 --> 00:18:57.570 align:middle line:90%
all around Peru near Cusco.

00:18:57.570 --> 00:19:01.290 align:middle line:90%


00:19:01.290 --> 00:19:09.220 align:middle line:84%
And the same types of cuts
are found at the Temple

00:19:09.220 --> 00:19:10.810 align:middle line:90%
of the Sphinx enclosure.

00:19:10.810 --> 00:19:13.780 align:middle line:84%
Just incredible stones
that are interlocking

00:19:13.780 --> 00:19:16.660 align:middle line:90%
like Jigsaw puzzles.

00:19:16.660 --> 00:19:20.140 align:middle line:84%
And one of the
benefits of this is

00:19:20.140 --> 00:19:22.330 align:middle line:84%
when you have
stones interlocking

00:19:22.330 --> 00:19:27.250 align:middle line:84%
like this, the way it
distributes the energy allows

00:19:27.250 --> 00:19:29.730 align:middle line:90%
it to be earthquake proof.

00:19:29.730 --> 00:19:32.280 align:middle line:90%
So that's an important point.

00:19:32.280 --> 00:19:34.740 align:middle line:84%
This is one of the things that
the Templars were finding.

00:19:34.740 --> 00:19:37.410 align:middle line:84%
And this is, of course, nothing
like what they were finding

00:19:37.410 --> 00:19:40.750 align:middle line:90%
anywhere in Europe at the time.

00:19:40.750 --> 00:19:43.250 align:middle line:84%
They also found, again,
more drill marks.

00:19:43.250 --> 00:19:46.090 align:middle line:90%
This is around rose granite.

00:19:46.090 --> 00:19:52.250 align:middle line:84%
Here's a very clear drill
mark into the granite.

00:19:52.250 --> 00:19:55.640 align:middle line:84%
They would take a diamond,
high-pressure drill

00:19:55.640 --> 00:20:01.490 align:middle line:84%
to even do that, but we know
it was done in ancient times,

00:20:01.490 --> 00:20:07.890 align:middle line:84%
thus implying significantly
high technology to do it.

00:20:07.890 --> 00:20:12.920 align:middle line:90%


00:20:12.920 --> 00:20:15.660 align:middle line:84%
The dynastic Egyptians
simply didn't have this.

00:20:15.660 --> 00:20:19.370 align:middle line:84%
They had copper
tools, and they just

00:20:19.370 --> 00:20:22.190 align:middle line:84%
didn't have the means
to do this type of thing

00:20:22.190 --> 00:20:25.670 align:middle line:84%
according to
standard archeology,

00:20:25.670 --> 00:20:29.470 align:middle line:84%
thus implying that
they inherited this.

00:20:29.470 --> 00:20:34.150 align:middle line:84%
The Templars also
discovered here on the left,

00:20:34.150 --> 00:20:41.360 align:middle line:84%
if you look real closely,
you'll see this is almost

00:20:41.360 --> 00:20:42.980 align:middle line:90%
looks like a road.

00:20:42.980 --> 00:20:45.140 align:middle line:84%
That's actually
the top of a tunnel

00:20:45.140 --> 00:20:49.940 align:middle line:84%
that's leading into the Great
Pyramid on the Giza Plateau.

00:20:49.940 --> 00:20:52.860 align:middle line:84%
So that's one of the things
that the Templars found.

00:20:52.860 --> 00:20:57.140 align:middle line:84%
And they found that they could
get into the Great Pyramid

00:20:57.140 --> 00:21:00.850 align:middle line:84%
through these
underground tunnels.

00:21:00.850 --> 00:21:04.090 align:middle line:84%
Another thing that was
significant, on the right

00:21:04.090 --> 00:21:07.180 align:middle line:84%
here, this is at Edfu
where the Templars also

00:21:07.180 --> 00:21:10.250 align:middle line:90%
had a base of operations.

00:21:10.250 --> 00:21:12.350 align:middle line:84%
They had to set up
a preceptory there.

00:21:12.350 --> 00:21:16.420 align:middle line:84%
In fact, if you go to Egypt,
all of these significant temples

00:21:16.420 --> 00:21:20.530 align:middle line:84%
all around Egypt still have
Templar markers or Templar

00:21:20.530 --> 00:21:21.950 align:middle line:90%
graffiti at them.

00:21:21.950 --> 00:21:24.290 align:middle line:84%
And that's how we know part
of what they were doing.

00:21:24.290 --> 00:21:29.860 align:middle line:84%
But Edfu is in particular was
where the Atlantis myth had

00:21:29.860 --> 00:21:32.000 align:middle line:90%
been preserved on the walls.

00:21:32.000 --> 00:21:37.910 align:middle line:84%
And this is probably
where Plato got it from,

00:21:37.910 --> 00:21:40.760 align:middle line:84%
the story of Atlantis
was from Edfu.

00:21:40.760 --> 00:21:44.188 align:middle line:84%
But in the sanctum at Edfu to
this day, there's still a--

00:21:44.188 --> 00:21:48.100 align:middle line:90%


00:21:48.100 --> 00:21:51.110 align:middle line:84%
what this is, is it's
a remnant of an ark.

00:21:51.110 --> 00:21:55.560 align:middle line:84%
It's a replica of an ark
like the Ark of the Covenant.

00:21:55.560 --> 00:21:57.650 align:middle line:84%
The Templars quickly
discovered that

00:21:57.650 --> 00:22:03.870 align:middle line:84%
at all of these temples,
places like Edfu,

00:22:03.870 --> 00:22:09.420 align:middle line:84%
at Esna, at Dendera,
the Temple of Hathor,

00:22:09.420 --> 00:22:16.440 align:middle line:84%
at Dendera, at Abydos, and
a number of other places.

00:22:16.440 --> 00:22:26.780 align:middle line:84%
The Egyptians were preserving on
the walls mention of these arks

00:22:26.780 --> 00:22:29.440 align:middle line:84%
just like the Ark
of the Covenant.

00:22:29.440 --> 00:22:34.420 align:middle line:84%
But they were all
throughout the temple walls.

00:22:34.420 --> 00:22:37.810 align:middle line:84%
And at one point
in time, these arks

00:22:37.810 --> 00:22:42.430 align:middle line:84%
were being preserved in the
sanctum sanctorum or the Holy

00:22:42.430 --> 00:22:46.670 align:middle line:90%
of Holies of these temples.

00:22:46.670 --> 00:22:49.280 align:middle line:84%
The Templars
believed, and we still

00:22:49.280 --> 00:22:52.520 align:middle line:84%
continue to believe that
these arks were actually

00:22:52.520 --> 00:22:55.640 align:middle line:90%
an ancient Atlantean technology.

00:22:55.640 --> 00:23:00.230 align:middle line:84%
They had been preserved by
the Egyptians for a while

00:23:00.230 --> 00:23:08.270 align:middle line:84%
until they were removed from
Egypt or stolen from Egypt.

00:23:08.270 --> 00:23:11.105 align:middle line:84%
Some historians even believe
that the real reason why

00:23:11.105 --> 00:23:15.140 align:middle line:84%
the pharaoh was pursuing
Moses was because he

00:23:15.140 --> 00:23:17.210 align:middle line:90%
had stolen one of these arks.

00:23:17.210 --> 00:23:20.540 align:middle line:90%
And so he was chasing them down.

00:23:20.540 --> 00:23:28.140 align:middle line:84%
But there were two things that
we can count on with these arks.

00:23:28.140 --> 00:23:30.020 align:middle line:84%
One, is they always
went in the sanctum

00:23:30.020 --> 00:23:33.390 align:middle line:84%
sanctorum or the Holy of
Holies of the Egyptian temples.

00:23:33.390 --> 00:23:38.450 align:middle line:84%
And two, is they were built
to contain a special substance

00:23:38.450 --> 00:23:41.990 align:middle line:84%
that the Bible
referred to as manna.

00:23:41.990 --> 00:23:49.230 align:middle line:84%
The Egyptian temple walls
refer to it as white cake.

00:23:49.230 --> 00:23:52.460 align:middle line:84%
In fact, this
hieroglyph right here

00:23:52.460 --> 00:23:55.770 align:middle line:84%
looks like a spoon, that
actually means white.

00:23:55.770 --> 00:23:59.460 align:middle line:84%
And then this mound
shape means cake.

00:23:59.460 --> 00:24:01.030 align:middle line:90%
White cake.

00:24:01.030 --> 00:24:03.975 align:middle line:84%
So these were sometimes
referred to as white cake.

00:24:03.975 --> 00:24:05.350 align:middle line:84%
They were also
sometimes referred

00:24:05.350 --> 00:24:12.100 align:middle line:84%
to as mfktz, which can also
be translated as turquoise.

00:24:12.100 --> 00:24:13.680 align:middle line:84%
But it's because
they were finding

00:24:13.680 --> 00:24:18.510 align:middle line:84%
this substance, this white
substance in a part of Egypt

00:24:18.510 --> 00:24:21.060 align:middle line:84%
where they also were
digging for turquoise.

00:24:21.060 --> 00:24:25.600 align:middle line:84%
But we always find
these things together.

00:24:25.600 --> 00:24:28.050 align:middle line:84%
And the Templars
quickly realized

00:24:28.050 --> 00:24:31.680 align:middle line:84%
from their communication with
the members of the Coptic Church

00:24:31.680 --> 00:24:34.320 align:middle line:84%
in Egypt that had
been preserving

00:24:34.320 --> 00:24:37.830 align:middle line:84%
some of this knowledge, as well
as their study of the temple

00:24:37.830 --> 00:24:43.740 align:middle line:84%
walls, that this white
powder, this white substance

00:24:43.740 --> 00:24:47.700 align:middle line:84%
was an alchemical
substance, and it

00:24:47.700 --> 00:24:50.603 align:middle line:84%
was something that had to
be extracted alchemically.

00:24:50.603 --> 00:24:52.520 align:middle line:84%
And we'll be looking at
that here in a minute.

00:24:52.520 --> 00:24:56.350 align:middle line:90%


00:24:56.350 --> 00:25:00.250 align:middle line:84%
On the left here, here you
see pharaoh again holding

00:25:00.250 --> 00:25:01.860 align:middle line:90%
one of these white cakes.

00:25:01.860 --> 00:25:05.180 align:middle line:84%
And this is something you'll
see at all the temples in Egypt.

00:25:05.180 --> 00:25:07.150 align:middle line:84%
They're always offering
these white cakes,

00:25:07.150 --> 00:25:15.220 align:middle line:84%
these conical cakes to the
netjer or the gods in Egypt.

00:25:15.220 --> 00:25:17.470 align:middle line:84%
And there's always
usually an ark

00:25:17.470 --> 00:25:20.550 align:middle line:84%
nearby just like in the
stories of the Bible.

00:25:20.550 --> 00:25:23.140 align:middle line:90%


00:25:23.140 --> 00:25:26.440 align:middle line:84%
On the right here, this is
probably a little harder to see,

00:25:26.440 --> 00:25:31.870 align:middle line:84%
but there's actually three
of these cones right here.

00:25:31.870 --> 00:25:35.760 align:middle line:84%
And this comes from the treasure
house of Pharaoh Thutmose

00:25:35.760 --> 00:25:40.050 align:middle line:90%
III, which is found at Karnak.

00:25:40.050 --> 00:25:45.300 align:middle line:84%
And if you go to Karnak, he
has all these vessels depicted,

00:25:45.300 --> 00:25:47.250 align:middle line:90%
these alchemical vessels.

00:25:47.250 --> 00:25:53.100 align:middle line:84%
And then he has all of these
cakes, these conical cakes,

00:25:53.100 --> 00:25:58.050 align:middle line:84%
which related to this manna
which the pharaohs were eating,

00:25:58.050 --> 00:26:00.910 align:middle line:84%
and they were also
putting in the arks.

00:26:00.910 --> 00:26:03.600 align:middle line:84%
And we'll talk about
that more soon.

00:26:03.600 --> 00:26:06.080 align:middle line:84%
But it's found all over
the walls in Egypt.

00:26:06.080 --> 00:26:08.590 align:middle line:90%


00:26:08.590 --> 00:26:14.990 align:middle line:84%
What that substance is
in modern depictions--

00:26:14.990 --> 00:26:19.750 align:middle line:84%
here's some manna, some
of this white cakes

00:26:19.750 --> 00:26:23.530 align:middle line:84%
that were actually produced
alchemically in the lab.

00:26:23.530 --> 00:26:28.020 align:middle line:84%
And this is what it looks like
before it settles when you first

00:26:28.020 --> 00:26:29.730 align:middle line:90%
manifest it.

00:26:29.730 --> 00:26:32.100 align:middle line:84%
And then as it
settles it actually

00:26:32.100 --> 00:26:36.060 align:middle line:90%
forms this conical shape.

00:26:36.060 --> 00:26:39.690 align:middle line:10%
That's where the Egyptians
got it from, was from this--

00:26:39.690 --> 00:26:40.960 align:middle line:10%
because that's how it settles.

00:26:40.960 --> 00:26:43.350 align:middle line:10%
It settles in this mound.

00:26:43.350 --> 00:26:46.150 align:middle line:10%
It looks like a conical shape.

00:26:46.150 --> 00:26:49.520 align:middle line:10%
And we'll look at
that more soon too.

00:26:49.520 --> 00:26:50.580 align:middle line:90%
Here's an example.

00:26:50.580 --> 00:26:52.290 align:middle line:90%
This is at Abydos.

00:26:52.290 --> 00:26:54.830 align:middle line:84%
There's actually a
secret chamber at Abydos

00:26:54.830 --> 00:26:56.310 align:middle line:90%
that they closed to the public.

00:26:56.310 --> 00:26:58.700 align:middle line:90%
They don't allow the public in.

00:26:58.700 --> 00:27:01.640 align:middle line:84%
And the reason why they don't
allow the public in there is

00:27:01.640 --> 00:27:04.350 align:middle line:84%
because there is
Templar graffiti,

00:27:04.350 --> 00:27:06.750 align:middle line:84%
that's what these
red crosses are,

00:27:06.750 --> 00:27:12.190 align:middle line:84%
there's Templar graffiti
from clear back in the 1100s.

00:27:12.190 --> 00:27:15.220 align:middle line:84%
And then what's actually
being depicted above it,

00:27:15.220 --> 00:27:19.600 align:middle line:84%
which is a little hard to
see, is one of these arks.

00:27:19.600 --> 00:27:23.620 align:middle line:84%
So the Templars were very
clearly pointing out clear back

00:27:23.620 --> 00:27:26.290 align:middle line:84%
in the 1200s they're
emphasizing, look,

00:27:26.290 --> 00:27:27.980 align:middle line:90%
we found one of these arks.

00:27:27.980 --> 00:27:30.610 align:middle line:84%
This particular room
where this was in

00:27:30.610 --> 00:27:37.000 align:middle line:84%
was the former laboratory
area in Abydos.

00:27:37.000 --> 00:27:42.730 align:middle line:84%
Here's another image of it
without me in the picture.

00:27:42.730 --> 00:27:45.070 align:middle line:90%
So here you see the crosses.

00:27:45.070 --> 00:27:48.850 align:middle line:84%
This is actually
the ark right here.

00:27:48.850 --> 00:27:53.750 align:middle line:84%
And then up here, again,
you see a figure holding one

00:27:53.750 --> 00:27:57.568 align:middle line:84%
of these mound cakes,
this alchemical substance.

00:27:57.568 --> 00:27:59.360 align:middle line:84%
And it was believed
that this was something

00:27:59.360 --> 00:28:03.920 align:middle line:84%
that had been inherited
from a pre-civilization

00:28:03.920 --> 00:28:09.480 align:middle line:84%
and was only rediscovered
by the Egyptians.

00:28:09.480 --> 00:28:13.680 align:middle line:90%
Here's some more of that mural.

00:28:13.680 --> 00:28:16.560 align:middle line:84%
The crosses would be
over here on the left,

00:28:16.560 --> 00:28:19.080 align:middle line:84%
but here it's actually
showing the ark going

00:28:19.080 --> 00:28:23.390 align:middle line:90%
under transportation in a boat.

00:28:23.390 --> 00:28:25.550 align:middle line:84%
And so what you see
here is actually

00:28:25.550 --> 00:28:28.250 align:middle line:84%
this is the same thing that
was found in that sanctum

00:28:28.250 --> 00:28:31.430 align:middle line:84%
sanctorum at Edfu
where they have

00:28:31.430 --> 00:28:34.950 align:middle line:90%
that reproduction of the ark.

00:28:34.950 --> 00:28:38.520 align:middle line:90%
But here they're moving it.

00:28:38.520 --> 00:28:39.880 align:middle line:90%
Here's some more arks.

00:28:39.880 --> 00:28:42.030 align:middle line:90%
This is at Dendera.

00:28:42.030 --> 00:28:45.340 align:middle line:84%
And, in fact, this
particular one

00:28:45.340 --> 00:28:47.680 align:middle line:90%
is levitating off the ground.

00:28:47.680 --> 00:28:51.990 align:middle line:84%
You can see where the
feet are of the people.

00:28:51.990 --> 00:28:55.000 align:middle line:84%
And there's some sort
of a field around it,

00:28:55.000 --> 00:28:57.400 align:middle line:84%
and it's levitating
off the ground.

00:28:57.400 --> 00:29:00.570 align:middle line:84%
And we'll talk more about
that in a few minutes too.

00:29:00.570 --> 00:29:01.800 align:middle line:90%
Here's some more arks.

00:29:01.800 --> 00:29:05.370 align:middle line:84%
That's at Dendera at a
private chamber at the Temple

00:29:05.370 --> 00:29:07.110 align:middle line:90%
of Hathor at Dendera.

00:29:07.110 --> 00:29:11.490 align:middle line:84%
If you've ever seen the famous
so-called light bulb hieroglyph,

00:29:11.490 --> 00:29:15.560 align:middle line:84%
it's in the same chamber
as the light bulb.

00:29:15.560 --> 00:29:20.190 align:middle line:84%
It's just the light bulb
is further down from it.

00:29:20.190 --> 00:29:23.740 align:middle line:84%
And this is just an
example I want to show you.

00:29:23.740 --> 00:29:26.430 align:middle line:84%
These are two little
models, but this

00:29:26.430 --> 00:29:28.410 align:middle line:84%
is a model of the
Ark of the Covenant

00:29:28.410 --> 00:29:31.710 align:middle line:84%
according to traditional
Jewish sources.

00:29:31.710 --> 00:29:35.010 align:middle line:84%
This is a traditional
Egyptian box.

00:29:35.010 --> 00:29:38.790 align:middle line:84%
The ark that you find
on the temple walls

00:29:38.790 --> 00:29:41.430 align:middle line:90%
they're the same thing.

00:29:41.430 --> 00:29:44.640 align:middle line:84%
They both are a golden box
with these winged figures

00:29:44.640 --> 00:29:50.490 align:middle line:84%
on the top of it, and
they're carried by poles.

00:29:50.490 --> 00:29:56.000 align:middle line:84%
Here are some other depictions
of modern day reproductions

00:29:56.000 --> 00:30:00.590 align:middle line:84%
of arks that the Egyptian
government has created

00:30:00.590 --> 00:30:04.490 align:middle line:84%
and the Egyptian antiquities
have created in recent years.

00:30:04.490 --> 00:30:06.230 align:middle line:84%
You'll find these
at different places,

00:30:06.230 --> 00:30:10.650 align:middle line:84%
including outside of Luxor,
different museums, and stuff.

00:30:10.650 --> 00:30:14.000 align:middle line:84%
But this big box in
the center of the boat

00:30:14.000 --> 00:30:15.655 align:middle line:84%
is supposed to be
the ark itself.

00:30:15.655 --> 00:30:18.170 align:middle line:90%


00:30:18.170 --> 00:30:22.500 align:middle line:84%
And it even has the winged
figures on the side of it.

00:30:22.500 --> 00:30:26.010 align:middle line:90%


00:30:26.010 --> 00:30:29.370 align:middle line:10%
One of the other things that
the Templars came across

00:30:29.370 --> 00:30:32.520 align:middle line:10%
is they started learning--
while they couldn't read

00:30:32.520 --> 00:30:35.520 align:middle line:10%
all of the hieroglyphs, there
was enough of a tradition

00:30:35.520 --> 00:30:40.290 align:middle line:10%
being passed on from the groups
that they were associating

00:30:40.290 --> 00:30:43.770 align:middle line:10%
with that they had somewhat of
an idea of what some of it meant

00:30:43.770 --> 00:30:48.180 align:middle line:10%
or what the names of
some of the things were.

00:30:48.180 --> 00:30:50.640 align:middle line:84%
One of the things that
the Templars were accused

00:30:50.640 --> 00:30:56.130 align:middle line:84%
of worshipping when they
were suppressed in 1307

00:30:56.130 --> 00:30:59.280 align:middle line:84%
and eventually burnt
at the stake at 1314

00:30:59.280 --> 00:31:03.990 align:middle line:84%
was they were accused of
worshipping this figure that was

00:31:03.990 --> 00:31:08.530 align:middle line:90%
known as Baphomet or Baphomet.

00:31:08.530 --> 00:31:13.170 align:middle line:10%
And on the right here, this is
the pretty standard depiction

00:31:13.170 --> 00:31:13.970 align:middle line:10%
of it.

00:31:13.970 --> 00:31:15.820 align:middle line:10%
That's by Eliphas Levi.

00:31:15.820 --> 00:31:17.830 align:middle line:10%
Eliphas Levi he's
known for writing

00:31:17.830 --> 00:31:19.730 align:middle line:10%
on magic and other
things like that,

00:31:19.730 --> 00:31:27.220 align:middle line:10%
but more importantly, one of the
things that Napoleon had done

00:31:27.220 --> 00:31:32.030 align:middle line:10%
was he had actually captured
all of the Vatican archives.

00:31:32.030 --> 00:31:36.370 align:middle line:84%
He actually raided the Vatican,
captured all the archives,

00:31:36.370 --> 00:31:39.170 align:middle line:84%
brought them back to
France for a time.

00:31:39.170 --> 00:31:41.620 align:middle line:84%
And Eliphas Levi was
one of the priests

00:31:41.620 --> 00:31:44.860 align:middle line:84%
who was in charge of
sifting through all

00:31:44.860 --> 00:31:47.590 align:middle line:84%
of that stuff that
had been brought back

00:31:47.590 --> 00:31:49.520 align:middle line:90%
by Napoleon to France.

00:31:49.520 --> 00:31:52.300 align:middle line:84%
He was actually stationed
at an area known as Saint

00:31:52.300 --> 00:31:55.160 align:middle line:90%
Sulpice, which is a cathedral.

00:31:55.160 --> 00:31:57.560 align:middle line:84%
That's where the
archives are brought to.

00:31:57.560 --> 00:32:00.700 align:middle line:84%
And specifically,
Napoleon was looking

00:32:00.700 --> 00:32:08.660 align:middle line:84%
for Templar-related artifacts,
Templar-related information.

00:32:08.660 --> 00:32:13.090 align:middle line:84%
And, in fact, you can
trace Napoleon's like

00:32:13.090 --> 00:32:17.540 align:middle line:84%
his entire campaign of
going to Malta and to Egypt.

00:32:17.540 --> 00:32:20.920 align:middle line:84%
And all of this was trying to
hunt down Templar artifacts

00:32:20.920 --> 00:32:27.550 align:middle line:84%
that he had become aware
of from the Vatican.

00:32:27.550 --> 00:32:29.530 align:middle line:84%
And Eliphas Levi was
one of the people

00:32:29.530 --> 00:32:32.950 align:middle line:84%
who was in charge of sifting
through that stuff, which,

00:32:32.950 --> 00:32:37.720 align:middle line:84%
just as a side note,
in more recent years,

00:32:37.720 --> 00:32:42.130 align:middle line:84%
there was a supposedly this new
document that was discovered

00:32:42.130 --> 00:32:46.870 align:middle line:84%
in the Vatican that said that
the Templars had actually--

00:32:46.870 --> 00:32:52.510 align:middle line:84%
or that the Vatican had
actually forgiven the Templars

00:32:52.510 --> 00:32:56.110 align:middle line:84%
and didn't want
to persecute them.

00:32:56.110 --> 00:32:59.320 align:middle line:84%
But, in my opinion,
it's kind of sketchy

00:32:59.320 --> 00:33:02.230 align:middle line:84%
that they just found that
recently after all the Dan Brown

00:33:02.230 --> 00:33:06.340 align:middle line:84%
hype because if that
thing really existed back

00:33:06.340 --> 00:33:10.960 align:middle line:84%
in antiquity, Napoleon would
have found it when he raided

00:33:10.960 --> 00:33:12.630 align:middle line:90%
the Vatican to begin with.

00:33:12.630 --> 00:33:13.690 align:middle line:90%


00:33:13.690 --> 00:33:17.050 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, the Chinon Parchment
is the name of it, yeah.

00:33:17.050 --> 00:33:19.040 align:middle line:84%
But he never found
that back then,

00:33:19.040 --> 00:33:20.590 align:middle line:84%
which leads me to
believe that it's

00:33:20.590 --> 00:33:24.760 align:middle line:84%
a more recent forgery
by the Vatican

00:33:24.760 --> 00:33:30.760 align:middle line:84%
to try to influence opinion
to a certain degree.

00:33:30.760 --> 00:33:33.040 align:middle line:84%
By the way, Napoleon's
personal physician

00:33:33.040 --> 00:33:36.760 align:middle line:84%
was a man by the name of
Bernhard Riemann Fabré-Paralat

00:33:36.760 --> 00:33:40.190 align:middle line:84%
who was the grandmaster of the
Knights Templar at the time.

00:33:40.190 --> 00:33:43.680 align:middle line:84%
So that was
Napoleon's physician.

00:33:43.680 --> 00:33:46.180 align:middle line:84%
So that's where he was also
getting some of this information

00:33:46.180 --> 00:33:46.980 align:middle line:90%
from.

00:33:46.980 --> 00:33:52.570 align:middle line:84%
But back to this image, this
horned figure that is usually

00:33:52.570 --> 00:33:55.690 align:middle line:84%
associated with
being a goat, that

00:33:55.690 --> 00:34:01.090 align:middle line:84%
was Eliphas Levi's attempt at
depicting what this thing was,

00:34:01.090 --> 00:34:05.530 align:middle line:84%
which looks pretty
horrifying and terrifying.

00:34:05.530 --> 00:34:09.400 align:middle line:84%
Most people think
of the devil even

00:34:09.400 --> 00:34:12.790 align:middle line:84%
though it had different
esoteric significance.

00:34:12.790 --> 00:34:16.210 align:middle line:84%
But the real origin of that
name, "Baphomet" actually,

00:34:16.210 --> 00:34:21.350 align:middle line:84%
came from the god
Amun of ancient Egypt.

00:34:21.350 --> 00:34:26.300 align:middle line:10%
And Amun or Amun-Ra
is another name.

00:34:26.300 --> 00:34:31.544 align:middle line:10%
Amun is where we get the
name or the word "Amen" from.

00:34:31.544 --> 00:34:35.770 align:middle line:90%


00:34:35.770 --> 00:34:40.080 align:middle line:84%
And Amun in ancient Egyptian
just meant the hidden one.

00:34:40.080 --> 00:34:45.500 align:middle line:84%
So Amun-Ra just meant the
hidden sun or the hidden--

00:34:45.500 --> 00:34:48.170 align:middle line:84%
it also represented
the hidden illumination

00:34:48.170 --> 00:34:51.270 align:middle line:90%
or the internal awakening.

00:34:51.270 --> 00:34:53.870 align:middle line:90%
And some have said that--

00:34:53.870 --> 00:34:56.449 align:middle line:84%
in fact, one of the
earliest prayers to Amun,

00:34:56.449 --> 00:34:58.910 align:middle line:84%
which can be found in
the papyrus of Ani,

00:34:58.910 --> 00:35:03.720 align:middle line:84%
starts out "Amun, Amun, who art
in heaven, hallowed be thy name.

00:35:03.720 --> 00:35:04.610 align:middle line:90%
Thy kingdom come.

00:35:04.610 --> 00:35:07.980 align:middle line:84%
Thy will be done
as above, so below.

00:35:07.980 --> 00:35:09.910 align:middle line:84%
Give us this day
our daily bread..."

00:35:09.910 --> 00:35:10.980 align:middle line:90%
and so on and so forth.

00:35:10.980 --> 00:35:13.010 align:middle line:90%
And it ends with "Amun, Amun."

00:35:13.010 --> 00:35:15.080 align:middle line:84%
This is actually where
the Lord's prayer

00:35:15.080 --> 00:35:22.520 align:middle line:90%
comes from that Jesus promoted.

00:35:22.520 --> 00:35:24.800 align:middle line:84%
And, in fact, in
the New Testament,

00:35:24.800 --> 00:35:26.540 align:middle line:84%
when the disciples
go to Jesus, they

00:35:26.540 --> 00:35:28.700 align:middle line:84%
say, Jesus, Jesus,
how should we pray?

00:35:28.700 --> 00:35:31.910 align:middle line:84%
And the Bible says, Jesus
says, well, first of all,

00:35:31.910 --> 00:35:35.070 align:middle line:84%
don't go to church and be
seen praying like a hypocrite.

00:35:35.070 --> 00:35:38.155 align:middle line:84%
The churches never
recite that part.

00:35:38.155 --> 00:35:39.500 align:middle line:90%
[CHUCKLES]

00:35:39.500 --> 00:35:41.370 align:middle line:84%
But that's what it
says in the Bible.

00:35:41.370 --> 00:35:45.470 align:middle line:84%
It says, if you want to
pray, go into a hidden place

00:35:45.470 --> 00:35:48.130 align:middle line:84%
like a closet and
then give this prayer.

00:35:48.130 --> 00:35:51.410 align:middle line:84%
So Jesus is actually telling
the people to become the Amun,

00:35:51.410 --> 00:35:53.180 align:middle line:90%
to become the hidden one.

00:35:53.180 --> 00:35:56.930 align:middle line:84%
And then he gives a prayer
which comes from ancient Egypt

00:35:56.930 --> 00:35:57.980 align:middle line:90%
to Amun.

00:35:57.980 --> 00:36:05.420 align:middle line:84%
Well, Amun was depicted
as a ram because not

00:36:05.420 --> 00:36:09.410 align:middle line:84%
only was that popularized
during the age of Aries, which

00:36:09.410 --> 00:36:17.240 align:middle line:84%
is the ram, but in ancient
Egypt, the word for soul

00:36:17.240 --> 00:36:19.940 align:middle line:90%
is ba, the ba.

00:36:19.940 --> 00:36:25.070 align:middle line:84%
And, of course, what kind
of sound does a ram make?

00:36:25.070 --> 00:36:26.930 align:middle line:90%
Baa, right?

00:36:26.930 --> 00:36:33.926 align:middle line:84%
So that's the reason why they
had Amun as this ram depicting

00:36:33.926 --> 00:36:38.750 align:middle line:84%
this spiritual process because
literally the ram calls out

00:36:38.750 --> 00:36:41.820 align:middle line:90%
"ba," which is soul in Egypt.

00:36:41.820 --> 00:36:46.470 align:middle line:84%
The word "fa" in ancient
Egyptian and in modern Arabic

00:36:46.470 --> 00:36:49.760 align:middle line:90%
means "in."

00:36:49.760 --> 00:36:57.170 align:middle line:84%
So if you have "ba," "fa,"
and then, in ancient Egypt,

00:36:57.170 --> 00:37:02.360 align:middle line:84%
the word for truth or universal
order was "ma'at" or "maat."

00:37:02.360 --> 00:37:08.060 align:middle line:84%
So "ba-fa-maat"
or "the soul in "

00:37:08.060 --> 00:37:10.670 align:middle line:84%
or "the soul in
universal order."

00:37:10.670 --> 00:37:13.740 align:middle line:84%
That's really what this
word Baphomet comes from.

00:37:13.740 --> 00:37:15.130 align:middle line:90%
That's the origin of it.

00:37:15.130 --> 00:37:18.410 align:middle line:84%
So this is one of the things
that the Templars figured out.

00:37:18.410 --> 00:37:21.500 align:middle line:10%
These are depictions of Amun--

00:37:21.500 --> 00:37:23.810 align:middle line:10%
that's at Luxor, actually.

00:37:23.810 --> 00:37:28.070 align:middle line:10%
And you'll see them in--
there's an avenue of sphinxes

00:37:28.070 --> 00:37:32.440 align:middle line:10%
going right that connects
Karnak to Luxor in Egypt.

00:37:32.440 --> 00:37:36.080 align:middle line:84%
And these sphinxes
are depicted as having

00:37:36.080 --> 00:37:43.730 align:middle line:84%
the ram head which was Amun
and then they have lion bodies.

00:37:43.730 --> 00:37:48.950 align:middle line:10%
And it's believed that one
interpretation behind the reason

00:37:48.950 --> 00:37:52.880 align:middle line:10%
why they have this is
because the lion represented

00:37:52.880 --> 00:37:54.590 align:middle line:10%
the age of Leo.

00:37:54.590 --> 00:37:56.977 align:middle line:84%
And this is where the
cataclysm took place,

00:37:56.977 --> 00:37:59.560 align:middle line:90%
it was during the age of Leo.

00:37:59.560 --> 00:38:01.940 align:middle line:84%
So the Egyptians were
constantly trying

00:38:01.940 --> 00:38:04.160 align:middle line:90%
to point back to that time.

00:38:04.160 --> 00:38:08.250 align:middle line:84%
And they were trying to
resurrect the knowledge

00:38:08.250 --> 00:38:10.050 align:middle line:90%
from that ancient time.

00:38:10.050 --> 00:38:17.860 align:middle line:84%
In fact, Osiris, one of the
chief gods or netjer of Egypt,

00:38:17.860 --> 00:38:20.010 align:middle line:84%
he's always depicted
with this funny crown.

00:38:20.010 --> 00:38:23.513 align:middle line:90%


00:38:23.513 --> 00:38:25.430 align:middle line:84%
Honestly, it looks a
little bit like a condom.

00:38:25.430 --> 00:38:28.140 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHS] Not to get crass.

00:38:28.140 --> 00:38:30.870 align:middle line:84%
But what that actually
is supposed to be is

00:38:30.870 --> 00:38:34.160 align:middle line:84%
it's supposed to
be a lion's arm.

00:38:34.160 --> 00:38:38.600 align:middle line:84%
So that crown again
represents the lion's arm

00:38:38.600 --> 00:38:40.290 align:middle line:90%
and the lion's paw.

00:38:40.290 --> 00:38:44.420 align:middle line:84%
And that was really,
again, hearkening

00:38:44.420 --> 00:38:49.160 align:middle line:84%
back to the age of Leo, to the
time of this pre-civilization

00:38:49.160 --> 00:38:50.580 align:middle line:90%
before the cataclysm.

00:38:50.580 --> 00:38:53.060 align:middle line:84%
So that's why you see
Amun, even though he

00:38:53.060 --> 00:38:55.940 align:middle line:84%
has the ram head, which
represents the time when

00:38:55.940 --> 00:39:00.080 align:middle line:84%
these sculptures were
made, he has the lion body

00:39:00.080 --> 00:39:02.540 align:middle line:84%
because it's pointing
back to this time

00:39:02.540 --> 00:39:04.480 align:middle line:90%
where there was a cataclysm.
