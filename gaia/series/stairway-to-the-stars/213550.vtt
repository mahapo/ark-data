00:00:11.530 --> 00:00:14.040 align:middle line:10%
>> It's great to be here.

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:15.080 align:middle line:10%
It really is.

00:00:15.080 --> 00:00:21.230 align:middle line:10%
And in preparation for this,
the challenge is always,

00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:23.360 align:middle line:10%
how do I pare this down
to an hour-and-a-half?

00:00:23.360 --> 00:00:26.920 align:middle line:10%
So I put together a program
that covers a lot of stuff,

00:00:26.920 --> 00:00:29.860 align:middle line:10%
but not the individual
things in the depth

00:00:29.860 --> 00:00:32.060 align:middle line:10%
that I would ordinarily like.

00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:33.320 align:middle line:10%
And here we go.

00:00:33.320 --> 00:00:35.050 align:middle line:84%
So I think what
we're going to do

00:00:35.050 --> 00:00:37.120 align:middle line:84%
is we're just going
to jump right into it.

00:00:37.120 --> 00:00:39.520 align:middle line:84%
Any of you guys out there
ever read or heard of the book

00:00:39.520 --> 00:00:41.130 align:middle line:90%
"Hamlet's Mill?"

00:00:41.130 --> 00:00:41.930 align:middle line:90%
A lot of you.

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:42.730 align:middle line:90%
That's great.

00:00:42.730 --> 00:00:43.870 align:middle line:90%
I knew you would, yeah.

00:00:43.870 --> 00:00:47.890 align:middle line:84%
That's been one of the early
books that came out in 1969.

00:00:47.890 --> 00:00:50.620 align:middle line:84%
And I might have actually
made my first attempt

00:00:50.620 --> 00:00:53.560 align:middle line:84%
to get through it
right around that time.

00:00:53.560 --> 00:00:56.090 align:middle line:10%
It's a deep and complex book.

00:00:56.090 --> 00:01:02.800 align:middle line:10%
But the gist of it is that the
authors, Giorgio Santillana

00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:05.890 align:middle line:10%
and Hertha von Dechend,
realized that there

00:01:05.890 --> 00:01:10.630 align:middle line:10%
was a lot more to the story
of what ancient peoples knew.

00:01:10.630 --> 00:01:14.710 align:middle line:84%
And they realized that
they based their long-range

00:01:14.710 --> 00:01:17.740 align:middle line:84%
computation of time on
the precessional cycle

00:01:17.740 --> 00:01:22.430 align:middle line:84%
of the equinoxes, which is
a roughly 26,000 year cycle.

00:01:22.430 --> 00:01:25.180 align:middle line:84%
How many of you are
familiar with the concept

00:01:25.180 --> 00:01:26.780 align:middle line:90%
of the great year?

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:29.710 align:middle line:84%
OK, so now there's been
different versions of that.

00:01:29.710 --> 00:01:32.765 align:middle line:84%
The Chinese version is a little
different than the Persian,

00:01:32.765 --> 00:01:34.640 align:middle line:84%
and that's a little
different from the Greek.

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:36.880 align:middle line:84%
But overall, most
ancient cultures

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:40.120 align:middle line:84%
had this concept that
there was a hierarchy

00:01:40.120 --> 00:01:41.740 align:middle line:90%
of cyclical phenomena.

00:01:41.740 --> 00:01:48.670 align:middle line:10%
And they saw a resonance or
a relationship, almost a--

00:01:48.670 --> 00:01:51.370 align:middle line:10%
what would you call it--
a fractal relationship

00:01:51.370 --> 00:01:55.010 align:middle line:10%
between the cycles that we're
all familiar with from our day

00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:57.710 align:middle line:10%
to day lives, such as
the diurnal cycle, which

00:01:57.710 --> 00:02:02.060 align:middle line:10%
is the daily cycle of the
Earth rotating on its axis,

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:05.070 align:middle line:10%
then the annual cycle of the
Earth going around the sun.

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:08.759 align:middle line:84%
But then they saw-- which
gives us our annual year.

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:11.280 align:middle line:10%
But then they saw that
there were greater cycles.

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:13.310 align:middle line:10%
And the tradition that
has come down to us

00:02:13.310 --> 00:02:15.950 align:middle line:10%
is that it's within
these greater cycles

00:02:15.950 --> 00:02:19.220 align:middle line:10%
that things happen
that sometimes change

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:21.120 align:middle line:10%
the entire face of the globe.

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:24.290 align:middle line:10%
And this is where I'm going to
start my discussion tonight,

00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:26.090 align:middle line:10%
about that.

00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:31.070 align:middle line:10%
I think many of us know that
modern humans have now been

00:02:31.070 --> 00:02:35.780 align:middle line:10%
dated based on actual datable
skeletal remains going back

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:38.250 align:middle line:10%
180,000 to 200,000 years.

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:42.560 align:middle line:10%
No telling how far back our
species of Homo sapiens sapiens

00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:46.860 align:middle line:10%
goes beyond that, but I always
stayed to the conservative side.

00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:50.870 align:middle line:10%
So for years, I was saying
modern humans went back 150,000

00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:53.595 align:middle line:10%
years, then it's been
pushed back to 180,000.

00:02:53.595 --> 00:02:55.970 align:middle line:10%
Now it looks like there are
skeletal remains that go back

00:02:55.970 --> 00:02:57.450 align:middle line:10%
200,000 years.

00:02:57.450 --> 00:03:01.100 align:middle line:10%
And I like people to contemplate
how far we've come in the last,

00:03:01.100 --> 00:03:02.150 align:middle line:10%
say, 300 years.

00:03:02.150 --> 00:03:04.400 align:middle line:10%
And I pointed out that when
I was born in the mid-20th

00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:05.750 align:middle line:10%
century, we had no--

00:03:05.750 --> 00:03:09.080 align:middle line:10%
basically, computers
were just being invented.

00:03:09.080 --> 00:03:11.430 align:middle line:10%
We had no presence
in space at all.

00:03:11.430 --> 00:03:13.710 align:middle line:84%
Most Americans didn't
even have televisions.

00:03:13.710 --> 00:03:17.000 align:middle line:84%
And I still have one of my very
early memories of my father

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:19.250 align:middle line:84%
bringing home a television
and unboxing it,

00:03:19.250 --> 00:03:20.610 align:middle line:90%
and how exciting that was.

00:03:20.610 --> 00:03:22.820 align:middle line:84%
I must have been
maybe three years old.

00:03:22.820 --> 00:03:25.910 align:middle line:10%
When my grandfathers were
born and grandmothers,

00:03:25.910 --> 00:03:28.190 align:middle line:10%
the main mode of
transportation on Earth

00:03:28.190 --> 00:03:32.180 align:middle line:10%
was foot or horseback or mules.

00:03:32.180 --> 00:03:34.910 align:middle line:10%
It was not-- there
were trains, of course,

00:03:34.910 --> 00:03:38.240 align:middle line:10%
but I say that
because I want people

00:03:38.240 --> 00:03:40.670 align:middle line:10%
to think about how quick,
how far we've come,

00:03:40.670 --> 00:03:46.170 align:middle line:10%
say in 120 years, or just
really four or five generations.

00:03:46.170 --> 00:03:49.910 align:middle line:10%
And then I want you to think
about if you have a span of time

00:03:49.910 --> 00:03:52.520 align:middle line:10%
that we modern humans have
been on this Earth for a couple

00:03:52.520 --> 00:03:57.780 align:middle line:10%
of 100,000 years, and you figure
that a generation is 25 years.

00:03:57.780 --> 00:04:01.370 align:middle line:10%
What that means is that there's
probably been at least 7,000

00:04:01.370 --> 00:04:02.910 align:middle line:10%
generations of humans.

00:04:02.910 --> 00:04:05.960 align:middle line:10%
Now, if you think about the
beginning of the Industrial

00:04:05.960 --> 00:04:08.780 align:middle line:10%
revolution, when that
began, if we go back,

00:04:08.780 --> 00:04:13.580 align:middle line:10%
say, to the late 1700 up to
the mid-1800s right in there.

00:04:13.580 --> 00:04:16.755 align:middle line:10%
And you consider how far
we've come since then.

00:04:16.755 --> 00:04:18.380 align:middle line:10%
In fact, let's go
back a little further

00:04:18.380 --> 00:04:19.880 align:middle line:10%
to the scientific enlightenment.

00:04:19.880 --> 00:04:22.110 align:middle line:10%
We'll allow ourselves 300 years.

00:04:22.110 --> 00:04:25.370 align:middle line:10%
How easily would it be for 300
years of progress to get lost

00:04:25.370 --> 00:04:28.230 align:middle line:10%
in the noise of 200,000 years?

00:04:28.230 --> 00:04:30.740 align:middle line:84%
And this is my beef
with modern archeology,

00:04:30.740 --> 00:04:36.320 align:middle line:84%
is they've got this entrenched
model of hunter-gatherer

00:04:36.320 --> 00:04:39.930 align:middle line:84%
was the dominant lifestyle
for all of these generations.

00:04:39.930 --> 00:04:41.660 align:middle line:10%
And somehow, even
though we acknowledge

00:04:41.660 --> 00:04:44.660 align:middle line:10%
that they would have
been as intelligent as we

00:04:44.660 --> 00:04:48.140 align:middle line:10%
modern people are, with the same
size cranial capacity and so on,

00:04:48.140 --> 00:04:51.230 align:middle line:10%
nobody ever really
invented anything that

00:04:51.230 --> 00:04:52.740 align:middle line:10%
could be construed as science.

00:04:52.740 --> 00:04:55.370 align:middle line:10%
There was no accumulated
knowledge apparently passed

00:04:55.370 --> 00:04:57.320 align:middle line:10%
on from generation
to generation that

00:04:57.320 --> 00:05:01.400 align:middle line:10%
would have allowed the human
species, our predecessors

00:05:01.400 --> 00:05:05.240 align:middle line:10%
and ancestors, to
transcend a brute existence

00:05:05.240 --> 00:05:09.650 align:middle line:10%
of hunter-gathering, maybe
later subsistence farming.

00:05:09.650 --> 00:05:12.300 align:middle line:10%
I think that model is
now completely obsolete.

00:05:12.300 --> 00:05:15.560 align:middle line:10%
And I think, when you look at
the archaeological establishment

00:05:15.560 --> 00:05:17.840 align:middle line:10%
and the profession,
I think there

00:05:17.840 --> 00:05:20.630 align:middle line:10%
are signs that they're
getting desperate to protect

00:05:20.630 --> 00:05:21.990 align:middle line:10%
that entrenched narrative.

00:05:21.990 --> 00:05:23.480 align:middle line:10%
And we'll also
mention that there's

00:05:23.480 --> 00:05:26.690 align:middle line:10%
a mutually reinforcing
thing going

00:05:26.690 --> 00:05:31.520 align:middle line:10%
on here between the geologists
who were trained in gradualism,

00:05:31.520 --> 00:05:34.880 align:middle line:10%
the Darwinists, the
paleontologists who

00:05:34.880 --> 00:05:38.930 align:middle line:10%
are trained in incremental
evolutionary change.

00:05:38.930 --> 00:05:44.420 align:middle line:10%
And what we've seen, I think, is
that's been blown completely out

00:05:44.420 --> 00:05:45.220 align:middle line:10%
of the water.

00:05:45.220 --> 00:05:48.220 align:middle line:10%
The last couple of decades
have shown that, yeah,

00:05:48.220 --> 00:05:51.310 align:middle line:10%
that change, really the
way we observe change

00:05:51.310 --> 00:05:55.360 align:middle line:10%
is not necessarily linear,
but it is very much more

00:05:55.360 --> 00:05:58.370 align:middle line:10%
like ancient people saw
it, which was cyclical.

00:05:58.370 --> 00:06:02.500 align:middle line:10%
So that's where I'm going to get
into here, talking about some

00:06:02.500 --> 00:06:04.810 align:middle line:10%
of the evidence
for cyclical change

00:06:04.810 --> 00:06:07.602 align:middle line:10%
and how the knowledge
of this cyclical change

00:06:07.602 --> 00:06:09.310 align:middle line:10%
has come down to us,
and what it may mean

00:06:09.310 --> 00:06:11.480 align:middle line:10%
for us in our own future now.

00:06:11.480 --> 00:06:15.540 align:middle line:10%
So this is a quote I really
love from "Hamlet's Mill."

00:06:15.540 --> 00:06:19.890 align:middle line:84%
"The task then was to
discover from the remote past

00:06:19.890 --> 00:06:25.140 align:middle line:84%
an utterly lost science, linked
to an equally lost culture--

00:06:25.140 --> 00:06:28.590 align:middle line:84%
one in which anthropologists
have seen only illiterate

00:06:28.590 --> 00:06:29.700 align:middle line:90%
primitive man."

00:06:29.700 --> 00:06:31.380 align:middle line:84%
So this was a major
challenge that

00:06:31.380 --> 00:06:33.785 align:middle line:90%
was thrown down back in 1969.

00:06:33.785 --> 00:06:35.160 align:middle line:10%
What has happened
to the interim?

00:06:35.160 --> 00:06:36.993 align:middle line:10%
Well, there was a lot
of resistance to this.

00:06:36.993 --> 00:06:41.770 align:middle line:10%
A lot of-- a lot of claims that
they were crackpots and fringe

00:06:41.770 --> 00:06:42.570 align:middle line:10%
scientists.

00:06:42.570 --> 00:06:46.890 align:middle line:10%
Never mind that they were
highly respected professors

00:06:46.890 --> 00:06:51.120 align:middle line:10%
in their respective
fields, never mind

00:06:51.120 --> 00:06:54.100 align:middle line:10%
that they amassed an
enormous amount of evidence.

00:06:54.100 --> 00:06:57.360 align:middle line:84%
It was much easier to just
say they're out on the fringe

00:06:57.360 --> 00:07:00.120 align:middle line:84%
and we don't really need
to look at the evidence

00:07:00.120 --> 00:07:01.680 align:middle line:90%
that they have amassed.

00:07:01.680 --> 00:07:05.250 align:middle line:10%
So one of the other sources
that I've used was--

00:07:05.250 --> 00:07:07.300 align:middle line:10%
you may have heard of
Will and Ariel Durant.

00:07:07.300 --> 00:07:10.300 align:middle line:10%
They wrote an 11-volume
history of civilization.

00:07:10.300 --> 00:07:17.140 align:middle line:10%
After spending a lifetime
cataloging and documenting

00:07:17.140 --> 00:07:19.880 align:middle line:10%
the history of
civilization on Earth,

00:07:19.880 --> 00:07:23.007 align:middle line:10%
Will Durant was
moved to say this,

00:07:23.007 --> 00:07:24.340 align:middle line:10%
because this is the realization.

00:07:24.340 --> 00:07:27.490 align:middle line:10%
If you want to-- in one
sentence, his insight

00:07:27.490 --> 00:07:30.700 align:middle line:10%
that he took away from 40
or 50 years of studying

00:07:30.700 --> 00:07:34.390 align:middle line:10%
the history of civilization
on planet Earth was this.

00:07:34.390 --> 00:07:38.020 align:middle line:84%
"Civilization exists
by geological consent,

00:07:38.020 --> 00:07:41.710 align:middle line:84%
subject to change
without notice."

00:07:41.710 --> 00:07:46.240 align:middle line:10%
And I think once
we incorporate this

00:07:46.240 --> 00:07:49.090 align:middle line:10%
into our paradigm of thinking
about the ancient past,

00:07:49.090 --> 00:07:52.850 align:middle line:10%
we're going to come to a much
greater understanding of why--

00:07:52.850 --> 00:07:57.460 align:middle line:10%
See, the critics, people who
will attack Graham Hancock

00:07:57.460 --> 00:08:00.740 align:middle line:10%
over ancient apocalypse right?

00:08:00.740 --> 00:08:03.880 align:middle line:84%
If you read through the
criticism and the attacks

00:08:03.880 --> 00:08:05.860 align:middle line:84%
on him-- how many of you
saw that, by the way?

00:08:05.860 --> 00:08:07.210 align:middle line:90%
Quite a few of you, yes.

00:08:07.210 --> 00:08:11.530 align:middle line:84%
Now, how many of you saw
that in your takeaway

00:08:11.530 --> 00:08:14.630 align:middle line:84%
after watching the
episodes of it was that,

00:08:14.630 --> 00:08:18.580 align:middle line:84%
oh, Graham Hancock is a racist
and a white supremacist?

00:08:18.580 --> 00:08:20.330 align:middle line:84%
How many of you that
was the takeaway?

00:08:20.330 --> 00:08:26.220 align:middle line:10%
And yet, right across the board,
every single critique and attack

00:08:26.220 --> 00:08:30.450 align:middle line:10%
that I read, and probably
at least 9 or 10 of them

00:08:30.450 --> 00:08:31.740 align:middle line:10%
from different sources--

00:08:31.740 --> 00:08:35.170 align:middle line:10%
from the media, from the
archaeological profession,

00:08:35.170 --> 00:08:35.970 align:middle line:10%
and so on--

00:08:35.970 --> 00:08:38.789 align:middle line:10%
they were all reading
from the same script.

00:08:38.789 --> 00:08:40.870 align:middle line:10%
That became very obvious.

00:08:40.870 --> 00:08:43.059 align:middle line:10%
So, what is the motive here?

00:08:43.059 --> 00:08:45.900 align:middle line:10%
I think the motive, again,
it's always the same--

00:08:45.900 --> 00:08:48.360 align:middle line:10%
control the
narrative of history.

00:08:48.360 --> 00:08:50.850 align:middle line:10%
If you can deprive people
of an authentic history,

00:08:50.850 --> 00:08:54.090 align:middle line:10%
that is one major component
in getting control

00:08:54.090 --> 00:08:56.080 align:middle line:10%
of a culture or a society.

00:08:56.080 --> 00:08:58.950 align:middle line:10%
And whenever we see
authoritarian or totalitarian

00:08:58.950 --> 00:09:01.950 align:middle line:10%
regimes come into place,
that's always consistent,

00:09:01.950 --> 00:09:05.370 align:middle line:10%
is to do everything you can
to erase the authentic history

00:09:05.370 --> 00:09:07.810 align:middle line:10%
and replace it with
a contrived history.

00:09:07.810 --> 00:09:09.720 align:middle line:10%
And I think that's
what we're actually

00:09:09.720 --> 00:09:11.680 align:middle line:10%
witnessing going on right now.

00:09:11.680 --> 00:09:14.590 align:middle line:10%
So let's go on here,
Chartres Cathedral.

00:09:14.590 --> 00:09:17.610 align:middle line:10%
I'm very fascinated
by the great--

00:09:17.610 --> 00:09:19.860 align:middle line:10%
well, I'm a builder
by profession,

00:09:19.860 --> 00:09:24.850 align:middle line:10%
so I'm very fascinated by the
art of building, architecture

00:09:24.850 --> 00:09:25.880 align:middle line:10%
design, and so on.

00:09:25.880 --> 00:09:29.410 align:middle line:10%
So I've drawn heavily upon
architecture and building,

00:09:29.410 --> 00:09:32.800 align:middle line:10%
because what I realized early
on in my studies going way back

00:09:32.800 --> 00:09:36.160 align:middle line:10%
in the '70s was that
architecture was being used

00:09:36.160 --> 00:09:40.330 align:middle line:10%
as a venue for
transmitting, preserving,

00:09:40.330 --> 00:09:41.990 align:middle line:10%
and transmitting knowledge.

00:09:41.990 --> 00:09:45.400 align:middle line:10%
And I think all of you in
here have an understanding

00:09:45.400 --> 00:09:46.805 align:middle line:10%
that that's going
to be the case,

00:09:46.805 --> 00:09:49.180 align:middle line:10%
whether it's in Egypt, whether
it's in Greece, whether it

00:09:49.180 --> 00:09:53.530 align:middle line:10%
was the monumental earthworks
of East and North America.

00:09:53.530 --> 00:09:57.820 align:middle line:84%
Whether it was the handiwork of
the predecessors of the Incas

00:09:57.820 --> 00:10:00.620 align:middle line:84%
in South America, whether it
was the Gothic cathedrals.

00:10:00.620 --> 00:10:02.260 align:middle line:10%
In all of these
cases, what we see

00:10:02.260 --> 00:10:04.210 align:middle line:10%
is that they serve
as repositories

00:10:04.210 --> 00:10:09.890 align:middle line:10%
of knowledge of what I would
argue is scientific knowledge.

00:10:09.890 --> 00:10:11.600 align:middle line:10%
Scientific knowledge.

00:10:11.600 --> 00:10:14.590 align:middle line:10%
So the Chartres Cathedral,
if you haven't visited,

00:10:14.590 --> 00:10:16.570 align:middle line:10%
I highly recommend it.

00:10:16.570 --> 00:10:18.850 align:middle line:10%
I could have spent
way much longer time

00:10:18.850 --> 00:10:21.940 align:middle line:10%
than I did there because
it is just loaded

00:10:21.940 --> 00:10:23.990 align:middle line:10%
with data and information.

00:10:23.990 --> 00:10:26.470 align:middle line:84%
And, of course, the vehicle
for the preservation

00:10:26.470 --> 00:10:31.160 align:middle line:84%
and transmission of that
information is symbolism.

00:10:31.160 --> 00:10:33.940 align:middle line:10%
So it's critically
important in order

00:10:33.940 --> 00:10:36.970 align:middle line:10%
to understand the mind
of our ancient ancestors

00:10:36.970 --> 00:10:40.240 align:middle line:10%
to become imbued with
the system of symbolism

00:10:40.240 --> 00:10:44.270 align:middle line:10%
and how symbolism is used
to propagate information.

00:10:44.270 --> 00:10:46.630 align:middle line:10%
Modern science uses
all kinds of symbolism.

00:10:46.630 --> 00:10:48.130 align:middle line:10%
There's a little
difference, though,

00:10:48.130 --> 00:10:50.800 align:middle line:10%
between the symbolism of
modern science, which is always

00:10:50.800 --> 00:10:53.770 align:middle line:10%
honing in on having a very
narrow and precise meaning

00:10:53.770 --> 00:10:55.270 align:middle line:10%
for a given symbol.

00:10:55.270 --> 00:10:57.700 align:middle line:10%
Whereas in the ancient
world, the power and potency

00:10:57.700 --> 00:11:02.320 align:middle line:10%
of a symbol was based on how
many things, how many variations

00:11:02.320 --> 00:11:06.500 align:middle line:10%
on a theme could you incorporate
into a single symbol.

00:11:06.500 --> 00:11:08.530 align:middle line:10%
So I'm going to show
you a symbol that

00:11:08.530 --> 00:11:10.390 align:middle line:10%
was one of the more
important symbols

00:11:10.390 --> 00:11:12.440 align:middle line:10%
that we find in many places.

00:11:12.440 --> 00:11:14.020 align:middle line:10%
We find it in
Vedic architecture,

00:11:14.020 --> 00:11:16.570 align:middle line:10%
we find it in
Gothic architecture,

00:11:16.570 --> 00:11:20.260 align:middle line:10%
we find it represented
in the numerical basis

00:11:20.260 --> 00:11:22.740 align:middle line:10%
to a lot of sacred texts.

00:11:22.740 --> 00:11:25.620 align:middle line:10%
Probably many of
that our own Bible

00:11:25.620 --> 00:11:28.290 align:middle line:10%
in the Judeo-Christian tradition
was originally written,

00:11:28.290 --> 00:11:30.730 align:middle line:10%
Old Testament in Hebrew
and New Testament in Greek.

00:11:30.730 --> 00:11:33.240 align:middle line:10%
Well, most of you may have
been aware of the fact

00:11:33.240 --> 00:11:36.750 align:middle line:10%
that prior to the advent of the
Hindu-Arabic numeral system,

00:11:36.750 --> 00:11:40.140 align:middle line:10%
the Hebrew alphabet
and the Greek alphabets

00:11:40.140 --> 00:11:42.340 align:middle line:10%
had a dual purpose,
a dual function.

00:11:42.340 --> 00:11:44.340 align:middle line:10%
They not only stood for
letters of the alphabet,

00:11:44.340 --> 00:11:47.500 align:middle line:10%
but they also stood for
the numbers that were used.

00:11:47.500 --> 00:11:51.270 align:middle line:10%
So if you get a copy of a
Hebrew bible or a Greek bible,

00:11:51.270 --> 00:11:55.900 align:middle line:10%
you will actually see Chapter
1 in the Hebrew will be aleph.

00:11:55.900 --> 00:12:00.810 align:middle line:10%
Chapter 2 will be beit,
ghimel, dalet, hey, vav, zain,

00:12:00.810 --> 00:12:05.620 align:middle line:10%
cheit, and so forth
through the alphabet.

00:12:05.620 --> 00:12:07.890 align:middle line:10%
And then what you
also discover is

00:12:07.890 --> 00:12:13.560 align:middle line:10%
that if you take a given
word or name or phrase,

00:12:13.560 --> 00:12:17.500 align:middle line:10%
you can substitute the letter
for the numerical value.

00:12:17.500 --> 00:12:19.080 align:middle line:10%
Now, this is a
system that's part

00:12:19.080 --> 00:12:20.910 align:middle line:10%
of a tradition called Kabbalah.

00:12:20.910 --> 00:12:26.550 align:middle line:84%
And within Kabbalah, the system
of gematria, or gematria,

00:12:26.550 --> 00:12:31.290 align:middle line:84%
is about translating
these sacred scripts

00:12:31.290 --> 00:12:32.860 align:middle line:90%
according to the numbers.

00:12:32.860 --> 00:12:35.760 align:middle line:10%
Well, when you do that,
something very interesting

00:12:35.760 --> 00:12:36.710 align:middle line:10%
happens.

00:12:36.710 --> 00:12:39.480 align:middle line:10%
You discover that
there is a meaning

00:12:39.480 --> 00:12:41.790 align:middle line:10%
and a system to those numbers.

00:12:41.790 --> 00:12:46.500 align:middle line:10%
And in fact, I go so far to say
that the outer literary forms

00:12:46.500 --> 00:12:49.140 align:middle line:10%
and the stories and the
allegories and so forth

00:12:49.140 --> 00:12:52.980 align:middle line:10%
is simply the vehicle for
transmitting and preserving

00:12:52.980 --> 00:12:56.430 align:middle line:10%
the mathematical underlying
foundation of the whole thing,

00:12:56.430 --> 00:12:58.060 align:middle line:10%
which is very scientific.

00:12:58.060 --> 00:13:01.750 align:middle line:10%
Gematria is related to the
word geometria, or geometry.

00:13:01.750 --> 00:13:05.640 align:middle line:84%
And as it turns out, these
numerical relationships actually

00:13:05.640 --> 00:13:10.120 align:middle line:84%
can yield geometric numbers,
which could be proportions,

00:13:10.120 --> 00:13:11.800 align:middle line:90%
and ratios, and so forth.

00:13:11.800 --> 00:13:15.700 align:middle line:10%
And what happens then is,
this to me is so fascinating,

00:13:15.700 --> 00:13:20.230 align:middle line:10%
is that if you start translating
these sacred writings according

00:13:20.230 --> 00:13:23.830 align:middle line:10%
to the numbers, and then you
begin to analyze the numbers

00:13:23.830 --> 00:13:26.500 align:middle line:10%
and the interrelations of those
numbers, what you discover

00:13:26.500 --> 00:13:28.420 align:middle line:10%
is that you're really
being led right

00:13:28.420 --> 00:13:30.010 align:middle line:10%
into the realm of geometry.

00:13:30.010 --> 00:13:33.010 align:middle line:10%
And the geometric
forms that come forward

00:13:33.010 --> 00:13:35.410 align:middle line:10%
as you're doing
this interpretation,

00:13:35.410 --> 00:13:38.020 align:middle line:10%
are precisely the
forms of geometry

00:13:38.020 --> 00:13:39.940 align:middle line:10%
that were used to
design and build

00:13:39.940 --> 00:13:42.520 align:middle line:10%
the great sacred structures
all through history

00:13:42.520 --> 00:13:47.600 align:middle line:10%
and through across the world,
which to me is an amazing thing.

00:13:47.600 --> 00:13:52.690 align:middle line:10%
Once you begin to understand
the basis of design,

00:13:52.690 --> 00:13:56.290 align:middle line:10%
whether it's a Gothic cathedral
or a truncated pyramidal mound

00:13:56.290 --> 00:13:59.470 align:middle line:10%
along the Ohio river,
what you realize

00:13:59.470 --> 00:14:03.130 align:middle line:10%
is that when you look at
the system of geometry,

00:14:03.130 --> 00:14:05.770 align:middle line:10%
when you look at the
system of archaeoastronomy,

00:14:05.770 --> 00:14:09.250 align:middle line:10%
the orientation that was used in
these structures, when you look

00:14:09.250 --> 00:14:14.050 align:middle line:10%
at the underlying
geological considerations,

00:14:14.050 --> 00:14:18.740 align:middle line:10%
how these structures
are not randomly placed.

00:14:18.740 --> 00:14:21.640 align:middle line:84%
They're placed with
knowledge and precision

00:14:21.640 --> 00:14:23.410 align:middle line:90%
about the underlying geology.

00:14:23.410 --> 00:14:27.010 align:middle line:84%
That's not quite so well-known
as the fact that is now

00:14:27.010 --> 00:14:28.930 align:middle line:84%
being accepted
even by mainstream

00:14:28.930 --> 00:14:31.220 align:middle line:84%
that there is an
astronomical component.

00:14:31.220 --> 00:14:32.800 align:middle line:10%
But when you take
all of these things

00:14:32.800 --> 00:14:36.370 align:middle line:10%
together, what you realize
is that all of these master

00:14:36.370 --> 00:14:39.850 align:middle line:10%
builders, through the ages, were
working from the same template.

00:14:39.850 --> 00:14:42.550 align:middle line:10%
Now, this to me is a
very amazing thing,

00:14:42.550 --> 00:14:45.500 align:middle line:10%
which begs for some
kind of an explanation.

00:14:45.500 --> 00:14:47.180 align:middle line:10%
What was the source
of this template?

00:14:47.180 --> 00:14:48.883 align:middle line:10%
Who was disseminating
this template?

00:14:48.883 --> 00:14:50.800 align:middle line:10%
So I'm going to leave
that there and I'm going

00:14:50.800 --> 00:14:54.920 align:middle line:10%
to move on here with one of
the geometric forms here.

00:14:54.920 --> 00:14:57.140 align:middle line:10%
So this is called the
Portal of Judgment.

00:14:57.140 --> 00:14:59.030 align:middle line:10%
It's Chartres Cathedral.

00:14:59.030 --> 00:15:00.500 align:middle line:10%
Couple of things
are interesting.

00:15:00.500 --> 00:15:04.210 align:middle line:84%
This is like if you look at
Chartres Cathedral as a book,

00:15:04.210 --> 00:15:05.590 align:middle line:84%
and you consider
a book will have

00:15:05.590 --> 00:15:07.720 align:middle line:84%
an introduction or a
foreword that gives you

00:15:07.720 --> 00:15:09.760 align:middle line:84%
a synopsis of what
the whole book

00:15:09.760 --> 00:15:14.840 align:middle line:84%
and what the implications
and meaning of the book is.

00:15:14.840 --> 00:15:16.900 align:middle line:10%
This Portal of
Judgment, which is

00:15:16.900 --> 00:15:19.490 align:middle line:10%
the entryway into the
cathedral, is like a statement.

00:15:19.490 --> 00:15:20.840 align:middle line:10%
It's an introductory statement.

00:15:20.840 --> 00:15:24.790 align:middle line:10%
Now, when you approach it,
one of the things you will see

00:15:24.790 --> 00:15:28.180 align:middle line:10%
is this, the tympanum,
the area above the door.

00:15:28.180 --> 00:15:31.570 align:middle line:10%
And you see the seated
figure of Christ.

00:15:31.570 --> 00:15:35.020 align:middle line:84%
And Christ is seated
within a geometric figure

00:15:35.020 --> 00:15:36.760 align:middle line:90%
called the vesica piscis.

00:15:36.760 --> 00:15:38.860 align:middle line:84%
And the vesica,
interestingly, we

00:15:38.860 --> 00:15:41.750 align:middle line:84%
find it shows up all over
cathedrals in Europe.

00:15:41.750 --> 00:15:48.100 align:middle line:10%
And when you look at these over
the many cathedrals in Europe

00:15:48.100 --> 00:15:51.430 align:middle line:10%
and abbeys and so on,
you find a repetition

00:15:51.430 --> 00:15:53.170 align:middle line:10%
of this vesica piscis.

00:15:53.170 --> 00:15:58.560 align:middle line:10%
Well, it occurs when you simply
draw a circle of a given radius,

00:15:58.560 --> 00:16:00.090 align:middle line:10%
and then you draw
a second circle

00:16:00.090 --> 00:16:02.310 align:middle line:10%
that's exactly the same size.

00:16:02.310 --> 00:16:05.100 align:middle line:10%
But the second circle,
its circumference

00:16:05.100 --> 00:16:07.530 align:middle line:10%
falls on the center
of the first one.

00:16:07.530 --> 00:16:09.550 align:middle line:10%
And that creates this overlap.

00:16:09.550 --> 00:16:11.850 align:middle line:10%
It's almost like a Venn diagram.

00:16:11.850 --> 00:16:16.320 align:middle line:10%
Well, out of this overlap
emerges the entire edifice

00:16:16.320 --> 00:16:17.430 align:middle line:10%
of geometry.

00:16:17.430 --> 00:16:21.790 align:middle line:10%
And from geometry, the entire
edifice of mathematics.

00:16:21.790 --> 00:16:26.440 align:middle line:10%
It's a very powerful feminine
symbol, and it serves as a womb.

00:16:26.440 --> 00:16:28.740 align:middle line:10%
Now, in this case,
Christ is in a role

00:16:28.740 --> 00:16:31.950 align:middle line:10%
here as gatekeeper
of this entryway

00:16:31.950 --> 00:16:35.770 align:middle line:10%
into, essentially, the
realm or world of geometry.

00:16:35.770 --> 00:16:37.960 align:middle line:10%
And you can't see
any more too well,

00:16:37.960 --> 00:16:41.500 align:middle line:10%
but he holds in his left hand
a book that's been broken here.

00:16:41.500 --> 00:16:43.900 align:middle line:10%
But the book is closed
and it's locked.

00:16:43.900 --> 00:16:47.250 align:middle line:10%
The idea is that you have to
prove yourself worthy before you

00:16:47.250 --> 00:16:48.930 align:middle line:10%
can enter this realm.

00:16:48.930 --> 00:16:52.170 align:middle line:10%
Now, you've probably heard
the saying that Pythagoras

00:16:52.170 --> 00:16:55.830 align:middle line:10%
had a subscription over the
door to his academy that said,

00:16:55.830 --> 00:16:59.060 align:middle line:10%
let none enter here who
are ignorant of geometry.

00:16:59.060 --> 00:17:02.020 align:middle line:10%
And many of you probably
know what the G stands

00:17:02.020 --> 00:17:05.420 align:middle line:10%
for in the Masonic tradition.

00:17:05.420 --> 00:17:08.470 align:middle line:10%
Geometry was considered to
be a key to understanding,

00:17:08.470 --> 00:17:13.510 align:middle line:10%
not only the hidden and visible
esoteric relationships of space,

00:17:13.510 --> 00:17:15.310 align:middle line:10%
but also of time.

00:17:15.310 --> 00:17:17.770 align:middle line:10%
So surrounding the
figure of Christ here,

00:17:17.770 --> 00:17:21.790 align:middle line:10%
we see four creatures.

00:17:21.790 --> 00:17:25.609 align:middle line:10%
Down on the lower left,
we see a winged lion.

00:17:25.609 --> 00:17:27.020 align:middle line:10%
Above that, we see an angel.

00:17:27.020 --> 00:17:28.900 align:middle line:10%
Over to the right,
we see an eagle.

00:17:28.900 --> 00:17:31.880 align:middle line:10%
And to the lower
right, we see the bull.

00:17:31.880 --> 00:17:34.780 align:middle line:10%
These represent the four
fixed signs of the zodiac--

00:17:34.780 --> 00:17:36.780 align:middle line:10%
the bull, the lion,
the eagle, and the man.

00:17:36.780 --> 00:17:38.150 align:middle line:10%
So you have the bull is Taurus.

00:17:38.150 --> 00:17:40.630 align:middle line:10%
The eagle is standing
in for Scorpio

00:17:40.630 --> 00:17:43.930 align:middle line:10%
because the
constellation of Aquila,

00:17:43.930 --> 00:17:47.630 align:middle line:10%
the eagle rises at the
same time as Scorpio does.

00:17:47.630 --> 00:17:50.230 align:middle line:10%
And so it can serve
as a time marker

00:17:50.230 --> 00:17:53.140 align:middle line:10%
to indicate that
same period of time.

00:17:53.140 --> 00:17:56.080 align:middle line:10%
So you have Aquarius, you
have Leo, you have Scorpio,

00:17:56.080 --> 00:17:57.350 align:middle line:10%
and you have Taurus.

00:17:57.350 --> 00:18:00.380 align:middle line:10%
Those represent the four
fixed signs of the Zodiac.

00:18:00.380 --> 00:18:02.920 align:middle line:10%
And you know that--

00:18:02.920 --> 00:18:05.780 align:middle line:10%
how many of you know what the
precession of the equinoxes is?

00:18:05.780 --> 00:18:06.640 align:middle line:90%
Most of you, yes.

00:18:06.640 --> 00:18:09.460 align:middle line:84%
This is critically
important because this

00:18:09.460 --> 00:18:13.090 align:middle line:84%
was the cosmic clock that our
ancestors were obsessively

00:18:13.090 --> 00:18:14.630 align:middle line:90%
observing and monitoring.

00:18:14.630 --> 00:18:17.740 align:middle line:90%
It's a very slow process.

00:18:17.740 --> 00:18:23.320 align:middle line:10%
It traverses the
plane of the ecliptic,

00:18:23.320 --> 00:18:25.310 align:middle line:10%
which is orbital plane.

00:18:25.310 --> 00:18:29.340 align:middle line:10%
You probably know that there are
12 signs of the Zodiac arrayed

00:18:29.340 --> 00:18:30.140 align:middle line:10%
around.

00:18:30.140 --> 00:18:32.140 align:middle line:10%
For the last
roughly 2,000 years,

00:18:32.140 --> 00:18:36.310 align:middle line:10%
the vernal equinox has been
transiting across the star

00:18:36.310 --> 00:18:38.455 align:middle line:10%
cluster of Pisces.

00:18:38.455 --> 00:18:40.970 align:middle line:10%
It's now moving out of Pisces.

00:18:40.970 --> 00:18:43.030 align:middle line:10%
And sometime, depending
on exactly how

00:18:43.030 --> 00:18:46.060 align:middle line:10%
you define the
divisions, sometime

00:18:46.060 --> 00:18:48.550 align:middle line:10%
in the next 200 to
300 years or so,

00:18:48.550 --> 00:18:52.640 align:middle line:10%
it will be moving into the
star constellation of Aquarius.

00:18:52.640 --> 00:18:56.530 align:middle line:10%
Now, that rate is usually
measured at about 50 arcseconds

00:18:56.530 --> 00:18:57.770 align:middle line:10%
per year.

00:18:57.770 --> 00:18:59.770 align:middle line:10%
I'm not going to go through
the mathematics now.

00:18:59.770 --> 00:19:01.900 align:middle line:10%
In my workshops
and so forth, we do

00:19:01.900 --> 00:19:04.410 align:middle line:10%
get into all of that in the
detail necessary to really

00:19:04.410 --> 00:19:05.210 align:middle line:10%
understand it.

00:19:05.210 --> 00:19:09.100 align:middle line:84%
But 50 arcseconds per year
works out to be about--

00:19:09.100 --> 00:19:13.450 align:middle line:84%
if you use that exact number,
it works out to be 25,920 years

00:19:13.450 --> 00:19:15.320 align:middle line:90%
for a full precessional cycle.

00:19:15.320 --> 00:19:19.630 align:middle line:10%
So that means if we could back
up the precessional cycle 25,920

00:19:19.630 --> 00:19:23.980 align:middle line:10%
years, the vernal equinox was
exactly in the place in the sky

00:19:23.980 --> 00:19:24.890 align:middle line:10%
that it is now.

00:19:24.890 --> 00:19:26.060 align:middle line:10%
Does that make sense?

00:19:26.060 --> 00:19:29.860 align:middle line:10%
So this was the cosmic clock
that our ancient ancestors

00:19:29.860 --> 00:19:34.190 align:middle line:10%
were so obsessively observing,
apparently for generations.

00:19:34.190 --> 00:19:37.720 align:middle line:10%
And this was a point that the
authors of "Hamlet's Mill" made,

00:19:37.720 --> 00:19:41.860 align:middle line:10%
was that it must have in order
to identify that slow motion

00:19:41.860 --> 00:19:45.160 align:middle line:10%
of 50 arcseconds per year,
it would have required many

00:19:45.160 --> 00:19:47.620 align:middle line:10%
generations of observation.

00:19:47.620 --> 00:19:50.200 align:middle line:10%
Now to give you an idea
of 50 arcseconds per year,

00:19:50.200 --> 00:19:53.850 align:middle line:10%
you know that every circle
is divided into 360 degrees.

00:19:53.850 --> 00:19:58.420 align:middle line:84%
Every degree is divided into
60 minutes, or minute sections.

00:19:58.420 --> 00:20:00.880 align:middle line:10%
And each of those
minute sections

00:20:00.880 --> 00:20:05.060 align:middle line:10%
are divided further into a
second order of minuteness.

00:20:05.060 --> 00:20:08.040 align:middle line:10%
So you have degrees,
minutes, and seconds.

00:20:08.040 --> 00:20:11.590 align:middle line:10%
Now, ordinarily, unless
you're an astronomer who's

00:20:11.590 --> 00:20:14.620 align:middle line:10%
plotting the stellar
motion, you don't

00:20:14.620 --> 00:20:17.110 align:middle line:10%
need the degree of
precision that you're

00:20:17.110 --> 00:20:19.460 align:middle line:10%
going to get with arcseconds.

00:20:19.460 --> 00:20:23.440 align:middle line:84%
But if you take 50 arcseconds
and you divide that

00:20:23.440 --> 00:20:25.870 align:middle line:84%
into the full circle, what
you're going to realize

00:20:25.870 --> 00:20:28.720 align:middle line:84%
is that's how you're going
to find out that it traverses

00:20:28.720 --> 00:20:31.880 align:middle line:90%
about 1 degree every 72 years.

00:20:31.880 --> 00:20:34.060 align:middle line:10%
Now, if you go out and
you look at the night sky,

00:20:34.060 --> 00:20:36.500 align:middle line:10%
how do you determine
what 1 degree is?

00:20:36.500 --> 00:20:41.440 align:middle line:10%
Well, the simplest way is that a
full moon or the orb of the sun

00:20:41.440 --> 00:20:43.300 align:middle line:10%
is right at a half-a-degree.

00:20:43.300 --> 00:20:45.160 align:middle line:10%
So if you were to
picture two full moons

00:20:45.160 --> 00:20:48.120 align:middle line:10%
tangent to each other, that
would be 1 degree in the sky.

00:20:48.120 --> 00:20:51.680 align:middle line:84%
That is about how far the
precession of the equinoxes.

00:20:51.680 --> 00:20:58.580 align:middle line:10%
The equinoxes move from east
towards the west in 72 years.

00:20:58.580 --> 00:21:00.680 align:middle line:10%
Which I always find
interesting, because if you

00:21:00.680 --> 00:21:04.200 align:middle line:10%
think of it this way,
that's like 72 years,

00:21:04.200 --> 00:21:07.230 align:middle line:10%
that the great year
is one cosmic day.

00:21:07.230 --> 00:21:11.700 align:middle line:10%
It's in almost the same
relationship as one day does

00:21:11.700 --> 00:21:13.090 align:middle line:10%
to our annual year.

00:21:13.090 --> 00:21:16.410 align:middle line:10%
Now, of course, many of
that ancient cultures

00:21:16.410 --> 00:21:18.670 align:middle line:10%
all over the world
sometimes ran two calendars.

00:21:18.670 --> 00:21:23.920 align:middle line:10%
The real calendar that we're
using now, 365.24 days per year.

00:21:23.920 --> 00:21:25.470 align:middle line:84%
But then there was
a sacred calendar

00:21:25.470 --> 00:21:29.230 align:middle line:84%
of 360 days, an
idealized calendar.

00:21:29.230 --> 00:21:32.370 align:middle line:84%
And in that calendar, you
can think of it this way.

00:21:32.370 --> 00:21:38.310 align:middle line:10%
One year-- or 72
years is very close

00:21:38.310 --> 00:21:41.100 align:middle line:10%
to the average human lifespan.

00:21:41.100 --> 00:21:45.020 align:middle line:10%
72 years is 1/360 of the
full precessional cycle,

00:21:45.020 --> 00:21:45.820 align:middle line:10%
a great year.

00:21:45.820 --> 00:21:49.350 align:middle line:10%
So you can think of your
own life, give or take

00:21:49.350 --> 00:21:54.130 align:middle line:10%
a decade or two, as being
one day of the great year.

00:21:54.130 --> 00:21:55.900 align:middle line:10%
One day of the great year.

00:21:55.900 --> 00:22:00.930 align:middle line:10%
One cosmic day is right about
the same as one human life.

00:22:00.930 --> 00:22:05.380 align:middle line:10%
So anyways, the other thing
that was important here is that

00:22:05.380 --> 00:22:10.420 align:middle line:10%
if you divide that 25,920
years into 4 seasons,

00:22:10.420 --> 00:22:14.320 align:middle line:10%
so just like the 12 signs of
the Zodiac marked the 12 cosmic

00:22:14.320 --> 00:22:17.050 align:middle line:10%
months, then you
had 12 of those,

00:22:17.050 --> 00:22:20.530 align:middle line:10%
just like there are 12
months in the annular year.

00:22:20.530 --> 00:22:22.720 align:middle line:84%
So we have this
fractal thing going on,

00:22:22.720 --> 00:22:24.590 align:middle line:90%
this self-similarity thing.

00:22:24.590 --> 00:22:26.470 align:middle line:10%
But then just as
in our annual year,

00:22:26.470 --> 00:22:28.540 align:middle line:10%
there are four seasons
that were conceived to be

00:22:28.540 --> 00:22:31.370 align:middle line:10%
four seasons of the great year.

00:22:31.370 --> 00:22:35.650 align:middle line:10%
So each one of those would
have been one-fourth of 25,920,

00:22:35.650 --> 00:22:38.560 align:middle line:10%
which is 6,480 years.

00:22:38.560 --> 00:22:40.250 align:middle line:10%
Now, here's the
interesting thing.

00:22:40.250 --> 00:22:45.850 align:middle line:10%
That pulse of 6,480 years was
considered to be the pulse

00:22:45.850 --> 00:22:49.490 align:middle line:10%
or the timing or
tempo of catastrophes.

00:22:49.490 --> 00:22:52.090 align:middle line:10%
And this is one reason why
it was so damn important

00:22:52.090 --> 00:22:54.370 align:middle line:10%
to the ancient peoples.

00:22:54.370 --> 00:23:00.400 align:middle line:10%
Now, if you divide that
25,920 by 12, you get 2,160.

00:23:00.400 --> 00:23:02.620 align:middle line:10%
Which is the number
of years average

00:23:02.620 --> 00:23:05.590 align:middle line:10%
that the vernal equinox
would spend in each

00:23:05.590 --> 00:23:08.420 align:middle line:10%
of the 12 signs of the zodiac.

00:23:08.420 --> 00:23:10.950 align:middle line:10%
So let's keep moving here.

00:23:10.950 --> 00:23:14.220 align:middle line:10%
So this is, again, a quote
from "Hamlet's Mill."

00:23:14.220 --> 00:23:16.400 align:middle line:84%
"The Greeks still
had the old idea,

00:23:16.400 --> 00:23:19.170 align:middle line:84%
but they asked themselves
questions about it.

00:23:19.170 --> 00:23:22.550 align:middle line:84%
What moved was the sky,
but questions about the sky

00:23:22.550 --> 00:23:24.660 align:middle line:90%
posed abstruse problems.

00:23:24.660 --> 00:23:28.400 align:middle line:84%
The greatest was, of course,
the slow motion of the tilt

00:23:28.400 --> 00:23:32.030 align:middle line:84%
of the sky, described above,
which went through a Great Year

00:23:32.030 --> 00:23:33.540 align:middle line:90%
of 26,000 years."

00:23:33.540 --> 00:23:39.990 align:middle line:84%
So this is the standard
to round it off to 26,000.

00:23:39.990 --> 00:23:44.760 align:middle line:10%
And so in another great book by
David Fideler, "Jesus Christ,

00:23:44.760 --> 00:23:49.320 align:middle line:10%
Son of God," he analyzes
the esoteric and kabbalistic

00:23:49.320 --> 00:23:52.000 align:middle line:10%
connotations of
the New Testament.

00:23:52.000 --> 00:23:53.040 align:middle line:90%
He says this.

00:23:53.040 --> 00:23:56.640 align:middle line:84%
"Yet Aeon-- from which
we get our word eon,

00:23:56.640 --> 00:23:59.520 align:middle line:84%
which is a word describing
a cycle of time--

00:23:59.520 --> 00:24:01.770 align:middle line:84%
had another meaning, too,
in the ancient world,

00:24:01.770 --> 00:24:03.490 align:middle line:90%
which is frequently overlooked.

00:24:03.490 --> 00:24:06.420 align:middle line:84%
It referred to the
vast ages, the 12 Aeons

00:24:06.420 --> 00:24:07.960 align:middle line:90%
or Platonic Months--

00:24:07.960 --> 00:24:09.690 align:middle line:84%
these are the signs
of the Zodiac--

00:24:09.690 --> 00:24:11.430 align:middle line:90%
which make up the Great Year.

00:24:11.430 --> 00:24:13.960 align:middle line:84%
Because of precession
of the equinoxes,

00:24:13.960 --> 00:24:17.400 align:middle line:84%
the sun moves backward
through the Zodiac,

00:24:17.400 --> 00:24:20.040 align:middle line:90%
one degree every 72 years.

00:24:20.040 --> 00:24:24.030 align:middle line:84%
As we saw, the central symbol of
the Mithraic mysteries conceals

00:24:24.030 --> 00:24:27.270 align:middle line:84%
an astrological code
related to the precession

00:24:27.270 --> 00:24:28.430 align:middle line:90%
of the equinoxes."

00:24:28.430 --> 00:24:30.790 align:middle line:10%
Now, I should mention
that Mithraism

00:24:30.790 --> 00:24:34.160 align:middle line:10%
was, for a few centuries, the
main competitor to Christianity.

00:24:34.160 --> 00:24:37.120 align:middle line:10%
It's a very interesting
religion that

00:24:37.120 --> 00:24:40.600 align:middle line:10%
was pretty much
practiced by the Romans,

00:24:40.600 --> 00:24:43.270 align:middle line:10%
and it was inherited
from Persia.

00:24:43.270 --> 00:24:46.180 align:middle line:10%
And the Persian's Mithras--

00:24:46.180 --> 00:24:49.000 align:middle line:10%
the Roman god
Mithras was descended

00:24:49.000 --> 00:24:51.880 align:middle line:10%
from the Persian
god Mitra, who was

00:24:51.880 --> 00:24:54.760 align:middle line:10%
descended from the Vedic gods.

00:24:54.760 --> 00:24:56.980 align:middle line:90%
The Vedic god also called Mitra.

00:24:56.980 --> 00:25:00.490 align:middle line:84%
So there was this transmission
from the Vedas to Rome,

00:25:00.490 --> 00:25:04.000 align:middle line:84%
and then you had this major
competition between Christianity

00:25:04.000 --> 00:25:05.270 align:middle line:90%
and Mithraism.

00:25:05.270 --> 00:25:08.410 align:middle line:84%
Christianity won out,
but it adopted a lot

00:25:08.410 --> 00:25:10.040 align:middle line:90%
of the traditions of Mithraism.

00:25:10.040 --> 00:25:15.490 align:middle line:10%
For example, the date that's
given for the birth of Mithras

00:25:15.490 --> 00:25:17.380 align:middle line:10%
was December 25.

00:25:17.380 --> 00:25:20.590 align:middle line:10%
Now, December 25 is interesting
because it comes a few days

00:25:20.590 --> 00:25:22.040 align:middle line:10%
after winter solstice.

00:25:22.040 --> 00:25:25.750 align:middle line:10%
So cultures all over the world
were observing this motion

00:25:25.750 --> 00:25:29.250 align:middle line:10%
of the sun through the course
of a year and they saw clearly--

00:25:29.250 --> 00:25:32.120 align:middle line:10%
now, I'm referring to the
northern hemisphere now--

00:25:32.120 --> 00:25:34.250 align:middle line:10%
that the sun moved--

00:25:34.250 --> 00:25:38.180 align:middle line:10%
had a vast difference
between its high point

00:25:38.180 --> 00:25:40.070 align:middle line:10%
during summer solstice
and its low point

00:25:40.070 --> 00:25:41.090 align:middle line:10%
during winter solstice.

00:25:41.090 --> 00:25:44.360 align:middle line:84%
It actually turned out to
be about 47 degrees, which

00:25:44.360 --> 00:25:47.940 align:middle line:84%
is based upon the angular
tilt of Earth's axis.

00:25:47.940 --> 00:25:51.720 align:middle line:10%
And they saw that in the
summer, the days were long.

00:25:51.720 --> 00:25:55.740 align:middle line:10%
And then on summer solstice, it
got the longest day of the year.

00:25:55.740 --> 00:25:57.950 align:middle line:10%
Then you had the days
begin to shorten.

00:25:57.950 --> 00:26:01.600 align:middle line:84%
And on autumn equinox, they
would be almost virtually

00:26:01.600 --> 00:26:02.400 align:middle line:90%
the same.

00:26:02.400 --> 00:26:04.100 align:middle line:10%
And then they
continued to shorten--

00:26:04.100 --> 00:26:07.340 align:middle line:10%
the days they got
shorter, they got darker.

00:26:07.340 --> 00:26:12.770 align:middle line:84%
And on December 21, 22 was
the shortest day of the year.

00:26:12.770 --> 00:26:14.540 align:middle line:90%
And this was now--

00:26:14.540 --> 00:26:18.200 align:middle line:84%
light had gone into a
submission to darkness.

00:26:18.200 --> 00:26:21.260 align:middle line:84%
And it usually took--
solstice means standstill.

00:26:21.260 --> 00:26:23.370 align:middle line:84%
The sun stands
still at that point.

00:26:23.370 --> 00:26:26.000 align:middle line:84%
Get let it stand still
for a couple of days,

00:26:26.000 --> 00:26:28.760 align:middle line:84%
and then come around
to 24th or 25th.

00:26:28.760 --> 00:26:31.340 align:middle line:10%
To any observer, you're
going to see each day--

00:26:31.340 --> 00:26:34.520 align:middle line:10%
if you're watching, let's say,
the sunrise on the horizon,

00:26:34.520 --> 00:26:37.430 align:middle line:10%
which is something I highly
encourage people to do to help

00:26:37.430 --> 00:26:40.640 align:middle line:10%
really get a sense of the
cosmic wheels in motion

00:26:40.640 --> 00:26:41.760 align:middle line:10%
and how they work.

00:26:41.760 --> 00:26:43.460 align:middle line:10%
If we're in the
northern hemisphere,

00:26:43.460 --> 00:26:45.770 align:middle line:10%
we're looking towards
the east, what

00:26:45.770 --> 00:26:48.170 align:middle line:10%
we see is that the rising
position of the sun

00:26:48.170 --> 00:26:50.030 align:middle line:10%
is swinging back and forth.

00:26:50.030 --> 00:26:52.640 align:middle line:84%
From this latitude,
almost about 90 degrees

00:26:52.640 --> 00:26:55.370 align:middle line:84%
between its summer
solstice and its winter

00:26:55.370 --> 00:26:58.200 align:middle line:90%
solstice rising positions.

00:26:58.200 --> 00:27:03.180 align:middle line:10%
So each day, you're seeing the
sun moving further to the south.

00:27:03.180 --> 00:27:05.750 align:middle line:10%
As we move towards
winter solstice,

00:27:05.750 --> 00:27:10.430 align:middle line:10%
it's going slower each
day the amount of space

00:27:10.430 --> 00:27:12.890 align:middle line:10%
because it's moving the
fastest when it's due east.

00:27:12.890 --> 00:27:15.930 align:middle line:10%
But then it's slowing
down, it stops,

00:27:15.930 --> 00:27:19.200 align:middle line:10%
it hesitates for a few days,
and then it begins to return.

00:27:19.200 --> 00:27:21.290 align:middle line:10%
And so there was a
celebration that goes back

00:27:21.290 --> 00:27:23.900 align:middle line:10%
thousands of years observed
by many cultures that

00:27:23.900 --> 00:27:27.020 align:middle line:10%
was celebrating the return
of the sun, the return

00:27:27.020 --> 00:27:27.960 align:middle line:10%
of the light.

00:27:27.960 --> 00:27:29.790 align:middle line:10%
This is the origin
of our Christmas.

00:27:29.790 --> 00:27:32.260 align:middle line:84%
And I put together
a presentation

00:27:32.260 --> 00:27:36.430 align:middle line:84%
on getting into the astronomical
basis of our observation

00:27:36.430 --> 00:27:38.980 align:middle line:84%
of Christmas, which is, I
think, probably available

00:27:38.980 --> 00:27:41.260 align:middle line:84%
online on my website, if
you're interested in diving

00:27:41.260 --> 00:27:42.590 align:middle line:90%
into that deeper.

00:27:42.590 --> 00:27:44.290 align:middle line:90%
But let's keep moving.

00:27:44.290 --> 00:27:46.960 align:middle line:10%
So here's just a
very simple diagram

00:27:46.960 --> 00:27:50.200 align:middle line:10%
that shows the two
great planes that

00:27:50.200 --> 00:27:54.950 align:middle line:10%
are of consequence to what's
happening here on Earth.

00:27:54.950 --> 00:27:57.980 align:middle line:84%
We have the plane of the
ecliptic, which is unvarying.

00:27:57.980 --> 00:28:01.660 align:middle line:84%
The Earth is moving around the
sun in that defines that plane,

00:28:01.660 --> 00:28:02.710 align:middle line:90%
the orbital plane.

00:28:02.710 --> 00:28:09.400 align:middle line:84%
Projecting that plane out onto
the sky is the 8 degrees above,

00:28:09.400 --> 00:28:10.210 align:middle line:90%
8 degrees below.

00:28:10.210 --> 00:28:12.590 align:middle line:84%
Within that band, that's
the belt of the Zodiac.

00:28:12.590 --> 00:28:15.340 align:middle line:10%
And so that's the
zone of interest

00:28:15.340 --> 00:28:18.280 align:middle line:10%
to the ancient cultures,
was those constellations

00:28:18.280 --> 00:28:21.920 align:middle line:10%
that lay along that
plane of the ecliptic.

00:28:21.920 --> 00:28:25.060 align:middle line:10%
Now, again, I said
that, we all know this,

00:28:25.060 --> 00:28:28.330 align:middle line:10%
that the tilt of the
Earth is 23.5 degrees out

00:28:28.330 --> 00:28:30.530 align:middle line:10%
of perpendicular to
its orbital plane.

00:28:30.530 --> 00:28:35.240 align:middle line:10%
But that motion, see,
is not consistent.

00:28:35.240 --> 00:28:37.880 align:middle line:10%
It's doing this.

00:28:37.880 --> 00:28:40.850 align:middle line:10%
And that's what takes
the 26,000 years.

00:28:40.850 --> 00:28:43.940 align:middle line:10%
Now, the equinoxes, if you
look at this diagram here,

00:28:43.940 --> 00:28:46.190 align:middle line:10%
this would be the
equinoctial point right here,

00:28:46.190 --> 00:28:49.560 align:middle line:10%
with these two great
cosmic planes intersect.

00:28:49.560 --> 00:28:51.960 align:middle line:84%
And it's the motion, the
movement of that point.

00:28:51.960 --> 00:28:55.830 align:middle line:84%
That's the movement
of the vernal equinox.

00:28:55.830 --> 00:28:57.920 align:middle line:90%
Here's another variation on it.

00:28:57.920 --> 00:29:01.500 align:middle line:84%
You can see here that 12 signs
of the Zodiac arrayed around.

00:29:01.500 --> 00:29:03.460 align:middle line:90%
Here's the celestial equator.

00:29:03.460 --> 00:29:07.590 align:middle line:84%
And as the pole
here rotates around

00:29:07.590 --> 00:29:10.260 align:middle line:84%
in that precessional motion,
that point of intersection

00:29:10.260 --> 00:29:12.540 align:middle line:90%
is moving along this circle.

00:29:12.540 --> 00:29:15.450 align:middle line:84%
So that's what was being
observed by ancient cultures

00:29:15.450 --> 00:29:17.730 align:middle line:90%
all over the world.

00:29:17.730 --> 00:29:20.790 align:middle line:10%
If we were to actually go
out and look at the night sky

00:29:20.790 --> 00:29:24.600 align:middle line:10%
and we would see that
Polaris, and you see Polaris

00:29:24.600 --> 00:29:29.150 align:middle line:10%
right here at the bottom, that
is the current North Star.

00:29:29.150 --> 00:29:33.780 align:middle line:84%
If we were to back up half of
this cycle 13,000 years ago,

00:29:33.780 --> 00:29:36.360 align:middle line:84%
the North Star, if you were
trying to navigate by the North

00:29:36.360 --> 00:29:38.650 align:middle line:84%
Star, you're going to
get hopelessly lost.

00:29:38.650 --> 00:29:42.000 align:middle line:10%
The North Star was Vega up here.

00:29:42.000 --> 00:29:47.130 align:middle line:10%
So during the time, roughly
12,000 years ago with the vernal

00:29:47.130 --> 00:29:53.290 align:middle line:10%
equinoxes transiting the Age of
Leo, the North Star was Vega.

00:29:53.290 --> 00:29:57.910 align:middle line:84%
And the difference in the
night sky is that 47 degrees--

00:29:57.910 --> 00:30:00.140 align:middle line:90%
23.5 times 2.

00:30:00.140 --> 00:30:06.490 align:middle line:10%
So vertical, tilt 23.5,
now go around a semicircle

00:30:06.490 --> 00:30:11.090 align:middle line:10%
and you've got 23.5 twice,
and that's your 47 degrees.

00:30:11.090 --> 00:30:14.320 align:middle line:10%
If this is making sense.

00:30:14.320 --> 00:30:21.200 align:middle line:10%
So let's go back to the
vesica piscis and the symbols

00:30:21.200 --> 00:30:22.890 align:middle line:10%
for the four ages of the world.

00:30:22.890 --> 00:30:27.860 align:middle line:10%
Now, if we were able to take a
snapshot of the night sky now,

00:30:27.860 --> 00:30:31.370 align:middle line:10%
and then 13,000 years in
the future or 13,000 years

00:30:31.370 --> 00:30:37.490 align:middle line:10%
in the past, and project
that dome onto a flat plane,

00:30:37.490 --> 00:30:40.070 align:middle line:10%
you would have two
circles that overlap.

00:30:40.070 --> 00:30:47.420 align:middle line:10%
So there's a map of those
two snapshots, if you will,

00:30:47.420 --> 00:30:48.660 align:middle line:10%
of the night sky.

00:30:48.660 --> 00:30:52.100 align:middle line:84%
So when you project
those onto a flat plane,

00:30:52.100 --> 00:30:54.710 align:middle line:84%
it produces almost
a perfect vesica.

00:30:54.710 --> 00:30:58.070 align:middle line:10%
So the vesica now has
become a symbol, not only of

00:30:58.070 --> 00:31:02.330 align:middle line:10%
geometry in space, but
the geometry of time.

00:31:02.330 --> 00:31:05.680 align:middle line:90%
[THEME MUSIC]
