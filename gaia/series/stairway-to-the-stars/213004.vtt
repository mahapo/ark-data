00:00:04.356 --> 00:00:07.744 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:07.744 --> 00:00:11.630 align:middle line:90%


00:00:11.630 --> 00:00:15.650 align:middle line:10%
>> So as we go forward here, I
want you to understand we are

00:00:15.650 --> 00:00:16.550 align:middle line:10%
this physics.

00:00:16.550 --> 00:00:17.660 align:middle line:10%
This is us.

00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:21.170 align:middle line:10%
This is the physics of
our experience of reality.

00:00:21.170 --> 00:00:24.110 align:middle line:84%
And what I'm going to postulate
to you as we around the corner

00:00:24.110 --> 00:00:30.410 align:middle line:84%
to the last phase of this talk
is that basically, the ancients

00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:31.880 align:middle line:90%
knew this.

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:35.450 align:middle line:84%
And what is the
best data storage?

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:40.640 align:middle line:84%
Because if I'm this body, my
body is going to decay, right?

00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:43.350 align:middle line:90%
My body's going to go away.

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:47.760 align:middle line:84%
Maybe some cultures got the idea
that the information was going

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:49.060 align:middle line:90%
to be preserved in the body.

00:00:49.060 --> 00:00:51.360 align:middle line:90%
And so what did they want to do?

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:53.460 align:middle line:90%
They wanted to save the body.

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:55.030 align:middle line:90%
They wanted to mummify that.

00:00:55.030 --> 00:00:55.830 align:middle line:90%
Save it.

00:00:55.830 --> 00:00:57.030 align:middle line:90%
Save the data.

00:00:57.030 --> 00:00:59.370 align:middle line:90%
The data is there.

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:04.260 align:middle line:84%
But this was actually more
of a little bit weaker

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:08.970 align:middle line:84%
understanding at the tail end
of lots of great consciousness.

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:12.180 align:middle line:84%
It's like Jesus saying
love your neighbors.

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:14.610 align:middle line:84%
And then later on Christianity
being like, oh, Yeah,

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:16.440 align:middle line:84%
but those witches
are doing herbs.

00:01:16.440 --> 00:01:17.280 align:middle line:90%
They must be evil.

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:18.390 align:middle line:90%
Let's go kill them.

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:19.470 align:middle line:90%
It's like no, no.

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:20.820 align:middle line:90%
That's not what he meant.

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:23.790 align:middle line:10%
And like that's not compatible.

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:26.950 align:middle line:84%
We take stories and we
change them over time.

00:01:26.950 --> 00:01:29.460 align:middle line:84%
So the question is,
what is the best way

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:32.350 align:middle line:90%
to store data in the universe?

00:01:32.350 --> 00:01:36.780 align:middle line:84%
What's the best data
storage on Earth?

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:39.060 align:middle line:90%
Rock.

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:41.820 align:middle line:90%
Rock and roll, baby.

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:43.650 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:01:43.650 --> 00:01:45.810 align:middle line:90%
You got to rock it.

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:47.280 align:middle line:90%
Rock is the key.

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:53.550 align:middle line:10%
Rock is the key because rock is
a geometric lattice structure.

00:01:53.550 --> 00:01:56.050 align:middle line:10%
It's perfect as a hard drive.

00:01:56.050 --> 00:01:58.620 align:middle line:10%
It can store all those
protons and it will keep them

00:01:58.620 --> 00:02:01.140 align:middle line:10%
there in the same
rough positions

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:04.180 align:middle line:10%
as they were thousands and
thousands and thousands of years

00:02:04.180 --> 00:02:04.980 align:middle line:10%
ago.

00:02:04.980 --> 00:02:07.510 align:middle line:90%


00:02:07.510 --> 00:02:10.479 align:middle line:90%
So what does that mean?

00:02:10.479 --> 00:02:15.970 align:middle line:84%
Maybe with the right kind of
pressure and/or energy applied

00:02:15.970 --> 00:02:19.480 align:middle line:84%
to rock, you could get
the information back out.

00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:24.490 align:middle line:84%
Maybe there's a way to get the
energy and the information going

00:02:24.490 --> 00:02:25.660 align:middle line:90%
back and forth.

00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:28.870 align:middle line:84%
Maybe there's a way that
all of these ancient sites

00:02:28.870 --> 00:02:31.210 align:middle line:84%
and structures are
actually really

00:02:31.210 --> 00:02:33.850 align:middle line:84%
actually advanced
computing systems

00:02:33.850 --> 00:02:37.000 align:middle line:84%
that are storing data
and memory of the rituals

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:39.580 align:middle line:84%
and the experiences and
the things and the magic

00:02:39.580 --> 00:02:41.450 align:middle line:84%
and the cultures
that created them,

00:02:41.450 --> 00:02:45.340 align:middle line:84%
which is why when
people go to these sites

00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:47.590 align:middle line:84%
and have experiences
at these sites,

00:02:47.590 --> 00:02:52.910 align:middle line:84%
they get downloaded
with information.

00:02:52.910 --> 00:02:56.730 align:middle line:84%
Now I want you to consider
one other thing while I'm

00:02:56.730 --> 00:02:58.450 align:middle line:84%
playing this little
video, and I'll just

00:02:58.450 --> 00:03:00.850 align:middle line:84%
move it because I already
showed you guys that.

00:03:00.850 --> 00:03:04.610 align:middle line:84%
I want you to consider
something else.

00:03:04.610 --> 00:03:09.760 align:middle line:84%
What if, just what if
my information structure

00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:15.880 align:middle line:84%
doesn't just stay with
my body when I die?

00:03:15.880 --> 00:03:20.880 align:middle line:84%
What if there are layers
to information structure?

00:03:20.880 --> 00:03:24.480 align:middle line:84%
What if there's the physical
information structure?

00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:29.100 align:middle line:84%
And what if it has an
etheric or energetic overlay

00:03:29.100 --> 00:03:32.310 align:middle line:84%
map that's also connected
to that structure?

00:03:32.310 --> 00:03:35.490 align:middle line:84%
And maybe that's connected
to another layer.

00:03:35.490 --> 00:03:38.430 align:middle line:84%
And maybe that's connected
to another layer.

00:03:38.430 --> 00:03:41.520 align:middle line:84%
And suddenly, those
crazy occult people

00:03:41.520 --> 00:03:45.180 align:middle line:84%
talking about the gross realm,
and then the subtle world,

00:03:45.180 --> 00:03:50.010 align:middle line:84%
and then the astral world,
and then the causal realm,

00:03:50.010 --> 00:03:56.220 align:middle line:84%
these dimensional planes, what
if it's not a bunch of BS?

00:03:56.220 --> 00:04:00.030 align:middle line:84%
And what if we actually--
those are actually

00:04:00.030 --> 00:04:03.900 align:middle line:84%
part of a sort of
hyper-dimensional information

00:04:03.900 --> 00:04:04.800 align:middle line:90%
structure?

00:04:04.800 --> 00:04:08.280 align:middle line:84%
And that the matter is just
one output of that information

00:04:08.280 --> 00:04:09.280 align:middle line:90%
structure?

00:04:09.280 --> 00:04:14.370 align:middle line:84%
So then let's say I drop my
physical information structure,

00:04:14.370 --> 00:04:18.700 align:middle line:84%
but I move on in my spiritual
information structure.

00:04:18.700 --> 00:04:21.279 align:middle line:84%
And I see that
there's going to be

00:04:21.279 --> 00:04:24.880 align:middle line:84%
some pretty sweet
hip-hop on the Earth,

00:04:24.880 --> 00:04:28.420 align:middle line:84%
and stuff is going
to getting real good.

00:04:28.420 --> 00:04:31.880 align:middle line:84%
I mean, the '70s is
looking pretty fly to me.

00:04:31.880 --> 00:04:34.750 align:middle line:10%
And I'm like maybe
I'll just come in right

00:04:34.750 --> 00:04:39.280 align:middle line:10%
at the tail end of
that, drop down 1982,

00:04:39.280 --> 00:04:45.610 align:middle line:10%
boom, incarnated in a new little
squealing little pink baby body.

00:04:45.610 --> 00:04:48.520 align:middle line:10%
New information structure.

00:04:48.520 --> 00:04:51.460 align:middle line:84%
And then as I grow up,
my information structure

00:04:51.460 --> 00:04:54.950 align:middle line:84%
gets more and more
synced with the present.

00:04:54.950 --> 00:04:57.940 align:middle line:84%
I get more and more clear
about the kinds of informations

00:04:57.940 --> 00:05:00.940 align:middle line:84%
and entanglements that I'm
facing now in this time

00:05:00.940 --> 00:05:02.950 align:middle line:84%
that I have to
process and integrate.

00:05:02.950 --> 00:05:06.400 align:middle line:84%
And I happen to
go to some places

00:05:06.400 --> 00:05:14.150 align:middle line:84%
where I entangled my information
structure in a prior meatsuit.

00:05:14.150 --> 00:05:16.770 align:middle line:84%
So the first time this really
intensely happened to me,

00:05:16.770 --> 00:05:17.990 align:middle line:90%
I was in Rome.

00:05:17.990 --> 00:05:21.410 align:middle line:84%
And I just lost my
stepmom in a car accident.

00:05:21.410 --> 00:05:22.670 align:middle line:10%
I was with my dad.

00:05:22.670 --> 00:05:25.580 align:middle line:10%
We were kind of recovering
from a lot of grief.

00:05:25.580 --> 00:05:28.040 align:middle line:10%
And I'm walking through
Rome and I look over

00:05:28.040 --> 00:05:31.370 align:middle line:10%
and there's the Colosseum and
there's these stairs going up

00:05:31.370 --> 00:05:32.300 align:middle line:10%
to the Colosseum.

00:05:32.300 --> 00:05:34.940 align:middle line:84%
And I looked at the
thing and it just

00:05:34.940 --> 00:05:37.820 align:middle line:90%
hit me like a cable of energy.

00:05:37.820 --> 00:05:42.650 align:middle line:84%
And suddenly, I'm having
this full intense flashback

00:05:42.650 --> 00:05:44.270 align:middle line:90%
of being there.

00:05:44.270 --> 00:05:46.190 align:middle line:90%
And I could feel it.

00:05:46.190 --> 00:05:50.600 align:middle line:84%
It was like I accessed the
information in the location,

00:05:50.600 --> 00:05:53.330 align:middle line:84%
and it re-stimulated
the information pattern

00:05:53.330 --> 00:05:54.330 align:middle line:90%
of the memory.

00:05:54.330 --> 00:05:56.330 align:middle line:84%
Now that was the first
time that happened to me.

00:05:56.330 --> 00:05:58.550 align:middle line:84%
How many of you have
had an experience

00:05:58.550 --> 00:06:00.830 align:middle line:90%
like what I'm talking about?

00:06:00.830 --> 00:06:02.510 align:middle line:90%
Great.

00:06:02.510 --> 00:06:06.200 align:middle line:84%
There may be sites and
places on the Earth

00:06:06.200 --> 00:06:10.880 align:middle line:84%
where you have stored knowledge,
wisdom, and information.

00:06:10.880 --> 00:06:14.600 align:middle line:84%
And that you don't know
what you had there maybe

00:06:14.600 --> 00:06:18.170 align:middle line:84%
necessarily until you
go back to that place.

00:06:18.170 --> 00:06:20.820 align:middle line:84%
And then because
the information,

00:06:20.820 --> 00:06:23.810 align:middle line:84%
especially when it's megaliths
and big stone structures,

00:06:23.810 --> 00:06:27.870 align:middle line:84%
maybe then you actually
get it back out.

00:06:27.870 --> 00:06:29.580 align:middle line:84%
And that's what I've
been kind of doing.

00:06:29.580 --> 00:06:31.460 align:middle line:84%
And I didn't even
know I was doing this.

00:06:31.460 --> 00:06:33.620 align:middle line:84%
I've been hunting
down these cool spots

00:06:33.620 --> 00:06:36.260 align:middle line:84%
finding them touching
the stone putting

00:06:36.260 --> 00:06:37.710 align:middle line:90%
my head against the stone.

00:06:37.710 --> 00:06:40.010 align:middle line:84%
And all of a sudden
I'm having memory,

00:06:40.010 --> 00:06:45.050 align:middle line:84%
and new information come
in, but it's not just

00:06:45.050 --> 00:06:47.240 align:middle line:90%
like out of the blue.

00:06:47.240 --> 00:06:54.440 align:middle line:84%
It's information about me,
about my life, my journey.

00:06:54.440 --> 00:06:56.960 align:middle line:10%
And I realized the
more people I met

00:06:56.960 --> 00:06:59.660 align:middle line:10%
that connected with the stars
and different star nations,

00:06:59.660 --> 00:07:02.480 align:middle line:10%
the more I worked with
Indigenous elders, the more I

00:07:02.480 --> 00:07:06.500 align:middle line:10%
started to unpack this great
story of where all of this

00:07:06.500 --> 00:07:12.050 align:middle line:10%
came from, the more I started to
find that we've left ourselves

00:07:12.050 --> 00:07:15.780 align:middle line:10%
all the keys that we need
to put the puzzle together.

00:07:15.780 --> 00:07:18.350 align:middle line:84%
And the keys are hidden
in the different cultures

00:07:18.350 --> 00:07:19.760 align:middle line:90%
right here on Earth.

00:07:19.760 --> 00:07:22.970 align:middle line:84%
The Maya, the Aztecs,
and the Toltecs, Mexico

00:07:22.970 --> 00:07:24.932 align:middle line:84%
is another one of my
favorite places to visit.

00:07:24.932 --> 00:07:26.390 align:middle line:10%
You know that these
sites have been

00:07:26.390 --> 00:07:30.260 align:middle line:10%
rebuilt over them-- over the
originals over eight times.

00:07:30.260 --> 00:07:32.570 align:middle line:84%
So the reason why
you're not seeing

00:07:32.570 --> 00:07:36.320 align:middle line:84%
the big amazing megalithic
stones, like we see in Egypt,

00:07:36.320 --> 00:07:39.050 align:middle line:84%
is because there's so much
wetness in the atmosphere

00:07:39.050 --> 00:07:41.720 align:middle line:84%
they've had to rebuild
and rebuild and rebuild.

00:07:41.720 --> 00:07:45.150 align:middle line:84%
The original structures
are just underneath there.

00:07:45.150 --> 00:07:48.407 align:middle line:84%
But the geometry still matches,
the magic still matches,

00:07:48.407 --> 00:07:50.990 align:middle line:84%
the connections are still there,
and of course, lots of people

00:07:50.990 --> 00:07:53.300 align:middle line:84%
you've probably heard
talk about those things.

00:07:53.300 --> 00:07:56.030 align:middle line:84%
But I'm going to point out
something else about the Maya

00:07:56.030 --> 00:07:57.800 align:middle line:90%
that most people don't mention.

00:07:57.800 --> 00:08:02.370 align:middle line:10%
The Maya say that the
four corn people--

00:08:02.370 --> 00:08:06.480 align:middle line:10%
the white, red,
yellow, and black skin

00:08:06.480 --> 00:08:08.400 align:middle line:10%
is essentially what
they're talking about,

00:08:08.400 --> 00:08:13.140 align:middle line:10%
peoples of the Earth come
from the four corners

00:08:13.140 --> 00:08:15.970 align:middle line:10%
of the river in the sky.

00:08:15.970 --> 00:08:18.180 align:middle line:84%
Now when they talk about
the river in the sky,

00:08:18.180 --> 00:08:20.040 align:middle line:84%
what do you think
they're talking about?

00:08:20.040 --> 00:08:22.350 align:middle line:90%
The Milky Way galaxy.

00:08:22.350 --> 00:08:28.620 align:middle line:10%
And this river in the sky is
the origin of these peoples.

00:08:28.620 --> 00:08:31.620 align:middle line:10%
Now that's a fascinating
concept, especially when

00:08:31.620 --> 00:08:33.990 align:middle line:10%
we start to look at
things like the fact

00:08:33.990 --> 00:08:39.330 align:middle line:10%
that biologists do not have a
definitive understanding of why

00:08:39.330 --> 00:08:41.600 align:middle line:10%
we all look so different.

00:08:41.600 --> 00:08:44.620 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't matter-- archeo
biology looking into it.

00:08:44.620 --> 00:08:48.370 align:middle line:84%
You get into genetics, you get
into the ley line differences.

00:08:48.370 --> 00:08:50.770 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, I mean, it
just doesn't quite

00:08:50.770 --> 00:08:55.000 align:middle line:84%
make sense that for,
let's say my ancestors,

00:08:55.000 --> 00:08:58.885 align:middle line:84%
they just were in
cloudy areas a lot more.

00:08:58.885 --> 00:09:03.340 align:middle line:84%
And then like my homie, he's
like his ancestors from Nigeria,

00:09:03.340 --> 00:09:05.630 align:middle line:90%
he's like put him next to me.

00:09:05.630 --> 00:09:08.830 align:middle line:84%
And he's like, well, it
was just more sunshine.

00:09:08.830 --> 00:09:12.370 align:middle line:84%
No, it doesn't actually
solve that puzzle.

00:09:12.370 --> 00:09:13.960 align:middle line:90%
It doesn't.

00:09:13.960 --> 00:09:17.020 align:middle line:84%
And the qualities of
our racial differences

00:09:17.020 --> 00:09:19.570 align:middle line:90%
are very specific and layered.

00:09:19.570 --> 00:09:21.790 align:middle line:84%
And of course, there's
all kinds of intermingling

00:09:21.790 --> 00:09:23.140 align:middle line:90%
throughout our genetics.

00:09:23.140 --> 00:09:27.730 align:middle line:84%
But I started to wonder maybe
our different genetic lines

00:09:27.730 --> 00:09:33.490 align:middle line:84%
maybe came from the four
corners of the river in the sky,

00:09:33.490 --> 00:09:34.720 align:middle line:90%
perhaps.

00:09:34.720 --> 00:09:37.150 align:middle line:84%
Well, then we should
have more evidence.

00:09:37.150 --> 00:09:40.880 align:middle line:10%
So we've got the
Aztec Sun Stone.

00:09:40.880 --> 00:09:41.710 align:middle line:10%
It's a compass.

00:09:41.710 --> 00:09:43.600 align:middle line:10%
It also detects time.

00:09:43.600 --> 00:09:46.660 align:middle line:10%
The whole Mayan time
system translated also

00:09:46.660 --> 00:09:49.960 align:middle line:10%
by Jose Argüelles is about
rotation through time.

00:09:49.960 --> 00:09:54.640 align:middle line:84%
It's connected to the 260
day cycle, which is 1320.

00:09:54.640 --> 00:09:59.230 align:middle line:84%
There's deep, deep layers of
mathematics and magic built

00:09:59.230 --> 00:10:01.150 align:middle line:90%
into this, the Tzolk'in.

00:10:01.150 --> 00:10:04.540 align:middle line:84%
Certain people have taken this
work further and established

00:10:04.540 --> 00:10:07.270 align:middle line:84%
that there's connections between
the I Ching and the Futhark

00:10:07.270 --> 00:10:08.070 align:middle line:90%
runes.

00:10:08.070 --> 00:10:10.960 align:middle line:10%
And that this is actually
part of a Galactic time

00:10:10.960 --> 00:10:16.130 align:middle line:10%
system that is intended to
help us understand natural time

00:10:16.130 --> 00:10:16.930 align:middle line:10%
cycles.

00:10:16.930 --> 00:10:20.410 align:middle line:84%
The fact that the Earth travels
around the sun, the moon

00:10:20.410 --> 00:10:24.250 align:middle line:84%
travels around the Earth, we
have 13 moon cycles per year.

00:10:24.250 --> 00:10:27.190 align:middle line:84%
And somebody along the
way decided, Yeah, we're

00:10:27.190 --> 00:10:28.490 align:middle line:90%
going to have 12 months.

00:10:28.490 --> 00:10:32.960 align:middle line:84%
And two of them are going
to be called me and my bro,

00:10:32.960 --> 00:10:35.510 align:middle line:90%
know Julius Caesar and Augustus.

00:10:35.510 --> 00:10:37.340 align:middle line:90%
And we'll just screw it up.

00:10:37.340 --> 00:10:38.540 align:middle line:90%
And who cares, right?

00:10:38.540 --> 00:10:41.990 align:middle line:84%
Because even though
October means eight,

00:10:41.990 --> 00:10:43.790 align:middle line:90%
we'll make it the 10th month.

00:10:43.790 --> 00:10:45.230 align:middle line:90%
Who cares.

00:10:45.230 --> 00:10:48.740 align:middle line:84%
We clearly are in a little bit
of a screwed up time system.

00:10:48.740 --> 00:10:51.530 align:middle line:84%
And of course, I spent time
with a Mayan daykeeper.

00:10:51.530 --> 00:10:53.750 align:middle line:10%
I held ceremony
with him in 2005.

00:10:53.750 --> 00:10:57.830 align:middle line:10%
And he taught me that it doesn't
matter what calendar you choose.

00:10:57.830 --> 00:11:01.670 align:middle line:10%
He said as long as you
count the sacred number,

00:11:01.670 --> 00:11:05.900 align:middle line:10%
you can count from any
starting or ending place.

00:11:05.900 --> 00:11:08.450 align:middle line:84%
But you've got to count
the sacred number.

00:11:08.450 --> 00:11:12.830 align:middle line:84%
You've got to recognize
there's a sacred cycle to time.

00:11:12.830 --> 00:11:16.430 align:middle line:84%
And through my work
with him, I actually

00:11:16.430 --> 00:11:20.750 align:middle line:84%
met Pu'uhonua Keiki Kanahele
and I met Arvol Looking Horse

00:11:20.750 --> 00:11:21.860 align:middle line:90%
and his family.

00:11:21.860 --> 00:11:24.830 align:middle line:84%
And Arvol invited me to do these
prayer runs for world peace

00:11:24.830 --> 00:11:26.000 align:middle line:90%
with him and his family.

00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:29.060 align:middle line:84%
So I ended up running
across North America

00:11:29.060 --> 00:11:31.970 align:middle line:84%
with a bunch of Indigenous
kids carrying an eagle staff

00:11:31.970 --> 00:11:34.670 align:middle line:84%
from New York all the way to
the Black Hills of South Dakota.

00:11:34.670 --> 00:11:36.920 align:middle line:84%
And I had a group come from
the west coast and a group

00:11:36.920 --> 00:11:38.330 align:middle line:90%
from the north and the South.

00:11:38.330 --> 00:11:41.570 align:middle line:84%
And we all met in the
middle of the Black Hills

00:11:41.570 --> 00:11:43.520 align:middle line:84%
for world peace
prayer day ceremonies,

00:11:43.520 --> 00:11:46.610 align:middle line:84%
the 10th annual one in the
middle of the Black Hills.

00:11:46.610 --> 00:11:50.840 align:middle line:84%
And on that journey, I
discovered and learned

00:11:50.840 --> 00:11:56.640 align:middle line:84%
that the Lakota people, these
beautiful amazing people, Yeah,

00:11:56.640 --> 00:11:58.120 align:middle line:90%
this is part of another story.

00:11:58.120 --> 00:12:00.570 align:middle line:84%
But one of our vans
blew up on the way.

00:12:00.570 --> 00:12:02.940 align:middle line:90%
It was a pretty crazy journey.

00:12:02.940 --> 00:12:04.920 align:middle line:10%
But I learned from
these Indigenous

00:12:04.920 --> 00:12:07.020 align:middle line:10%
elders that white
Buffalo Calf woman,

00:12:07.020 --> 00:12:10.600 align:middle line:10%
they don't just look at
her as like a spirit.

00:12:10.600 --> 00:12:12.990 align:middle line:10%
She was star nation.

00:12:12.990 --> 00:12:16.290 align:middle line:10%
She was a star nation
being who came down

00:12:16.290 --> 00:12:19.830 align:middle line:10%
to teach them and remind
them of their sacred rituals

00:12:19.830 --> 00:12:21.180 align:middle line:10%
in the stars.

00:12:21.180 --> 00:12:23.370 align:middle line:84%
And I was like, why don't
you guys tell people that?

00:12:23.370 --> 00:12:25.320 align:middle line:84%
They're like have you
tried telling people

00:12:25.320 --> 00:12:26.445 align:middle line:90%
you're from another planet?

00:12:26.445 --> 00:12:30.230 align:middle line:90%


00:12:30.230 --> 00:12:32.230 align:middle line:90%
And I was like good point.

00:12:32.230 --> 00:12:35.410 align:middle line:90%
Good point.

00:12:35.410 --> 00:12:38.650 align:middle line:84%
I generally avoid that,
unless Elizabeth April forces

00:12:38.650 --> 00:12:41.140 align:middle line:84%
me to reveal my full
galactic history in front

00:12:41.140 --> 00:12:44.260 align:middle line:90%
of an entire conference.

00:12:44.260 --> 00:12:48.700 align:middle line:84%
So white Buffalo Calf
woman is from the stars.

00:12:48.700 --> 00:12:52.900 align:middle line:84%
And I then went on the next year
from that world peace prayer

00:12:52.900 --> 00:12:56.890 align:middle line:84%
day, I ran through Alaska and I
ran all the way up to Eklutna.

00:12:56.890 --> 00:13:00.050 align:middle line:84%
And there we had the world peace
prayer day ceremonies in Alaska.

00:13:00.050 --> 00:13:02.200 align:middle line:84%
And there I met Maori
from New Zealand

00:13:02.200 --> 00:13:04.180 align:middle line:84%
who were traveling
around and activating

00:13:04.180 --> 00:13:05.470 align:middle line:90%
the whole ring of fire.

00:13:05.470 --> 00:13:08.080 align:middle line:84%
And they were doing
this to help rebalance

00:13:08.080 --> 00:13:09.880 align:middle line:84%
the energy of the
planet, because they're

00:13:09.880 --> 00:13:11.680 align:middle line:90%
like it's getting pretty wily.

00:13:11.680 --> 00:13:13.600 align:middle line:84%
It's like back in
the days of Atlantis,

00:13:13.600 --> 00:13:15.947 align:middle line:84%
like we need to keep
the Earth grounded

00:13:15.947 --> 00:13:17.530 align:middle line:84%
because our
electromagnetic fields are

00:13:17.530 --> 00:13:19.270 align:middle line:90%
getting a little crazy.

00:13:19.270 --> 00:13:21.670 align:middle line:84%
So there's people
actively doing the work

00:13:21.670 --> 00:13:25.423 align:middle line:84%
to keep the stability of the
energetic field of the planet.

00:13:25.423 --> 00:13:27.340 align:middle line:84%
And I was like, how to
do you know to do this?

00:13:27.340 --> 00:13:28.550 align:middle line:90%
And who showed this?

00:13:28.550 --> 00:13:32.950 align:middle line:10%
They're like, well,
we're Pleiadians.

00:13:32.950 --> 00:13:37.540 align:middle line:84%
We've been here for like a long
time, like you heard of Lemuria,

00:13:37.540 --> 00:13:39.100 align:middle line:90%
it's a bad name.

00:13:39.100 --> 00:13:40.820 align:middle line:90%
But we've been here since then.

00:13:40.820 --> 00:13:43.420 align:middle line:84%
And we've been passing
along this knowledge.

00:13:43.420 --> 00:13:45.440 align:middle line:84%
And we teach our
children this knowledge.

00:13:45.440 --> 00:13:48.250 align:middle line:84%
How do you care for
the oceanic field

00:13:48.250 --> 00:13:51.040 align:middle line:84%
and the balance of the
electromagnetism of the planet?

00:13:51.040 --> 00:13:54.160 align:middle line:84%
And then I started finding other
elders and other traditions

00:13:54.160 --> 00:13:58.780 align:middle line:84%
and I started to realize so many
of our Indigenous traditions

00:13:58.780 --> 00:14:01.000 align:middle line:84%
and our oldest
traditions on the planet

00:14:01.000 --> 00:14:03.100 align:middle line:90%
say they come from the stars.

00:14:03.100 --> 00:14:05.110 align:middle line:84%
I mean, we've all
heard the story,

00:14:05.110 --> 00:14:06.760 align:middle line:90%
like the gods and the goddesses.

00:14:06.760 --> 00:14:10.750 align:middle line:84%
The sun gods came down and they
taught us the things, whatever.

00:14:10.750 --> 00:14:12.340 align:middle line:84%
And all of the
archeologists are like,

00:14:12.340 --> 00:14:15.400 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, cool, that's an
interesting mythology.

00:14:15.400 --> 00:14:18.280 align:middle line:84%
You guys have
great imaginations.

00:14:18.280 --> 00:14:21.430 align:middle line:84%
But what if it's
not quite like that?

00:14:21.430 --> 00:14:23.080 align:middle line:90%
You go into Daoism.

00:14:23.080 --> 00:14:25.510 align:middle line:84%
And I was deep in Daoist
studies in college.

00:14:25.510 --> 00:14:28.120 align:middle line:84%
I was really into
energy body circulation,

00:14:28.120 --> 00:14:31.930 align:middle line:84%
sacred sexuality, Shiatsu,
learning healing techniques.

00:14:31.930 --> 00:14:33.140 align:middle line:90%
And all of these things.

00:14:33.140 --> 00:14:36.280 align:middle line:10%
And as I got into Daoism,
I started wondering,

00:14:36.280 --> 00:14:40.210 align:middle line:10%
why is it that hidden and
kind encoded in all of this

00:14:40.210 --> 00:14:42.550 align:middle line:10%
are all of these
keys that have to do

00:14:42.550 --> 00:14:44.290 align:middle line:10%
with the stars and the galaxy?

00:14:44.290 --> 00:14:47.290 align:middle line:84%
That there's even star
stepping processes

00:14:47.290 --> 00:14:50.920 align:middle line:84%
where you can travel
around a specific star

00:14:50.920 --> 00:14:53.680 align:middle line:84%
pattern in a
specific way in order

00:14:53.680 --> 00:14:56.260 align:middle line:84%
to activate your consciousness
in a certain way.

00:14:56.260 --> 00:14:58.840 align:middle line:84%
And I had a friend who
was up in the Himalayas

00:14:58.840 --> 00:15:01.390 align:middle line:84%
studying at a particular
monastery there.

00:15:01.390 --> 00:15:04.030 align:middle line:84%
And he told me that
they were bringing out

00:15:04.030 --> 00:15:06.400 align:middle line:84%
all of these scrolls
from under the monastery.

00:15:06.400 --> 00:15:08.440 align:middle line:84%
And the monks had
begun translating

00:15:08.440 --> 00:15:11.500 align:middle line:84%
these ancient scrolls
that are super old.

00:15:11.500 --> 00:15:15.680 align:middle line:84%
And these things
literally have within them

00:15:15.680 --> 00:15:19.990 align:middle line:84%
these codexes of how the body
is connected to different star

00:15:19.990 --> 00:15:23.830 align:middle line:84%
systems, and where and how
different knowledge enters

00:15:23.830 --> 00:15:27.490 align:middle line:84%
the body and exits the body,
high level magic, high level

00:15:27.490 --> 00:15:32.240 align:middle line:84%
traditions, things about physics
and the universe that are just

00:15:32.240 --> 00:15:34.610 align:middle line:90%
not really well understood now.

00:15:34.610 --> 00:15:37.010 align:middle line:84%
And these are in
the oldest scrolls

00:15:37.010 --> 00:15:39.440 align:middle line:84%
in the base of
these monasteries.

00:15:39.440 --> 00:15:42.830 align:middle line:10%
And, of course, in doing
some of these practices,

00:15:42.830 --> 00:15:45.140 align:middle line:10%
opening up the
stargates and the body,

00:15:45.140 --> 00:15:48.410 align:middle line:10%
learning how to do
things like star linking,

00:15:48.410 --> 00:15:52.040 align:middle line:10%
I started to realize
this is some real stuff.

00:15:52.040 --> 00:15:55.880 align:middle line:10%
This is some powerful martial
arts and healing tools.

00:15:55.880 --> 00:15:58.190 align:middle line:10%
And this has been
baked into some

00:15:58.190 --> 00:16:01.010 align:middle line:10%
of the roots of
Chinese medicine.

00:16:01.010 --> 00:16:04.205 align:middle line:10%
The roots of the understanding
of the meridians and things

00:16:04.205 --> 00:16:05.330 align:middle line:10%
that are much more popular.

00:16:05.330 --> 00:16:08.130 align:middle line:90%
Most people have heard about.

00:16:08.130 --> 00:16:12.240 align:middle line:84%
And I got really fascinated
by the connection

00:16:12.240 --> 00:16:15.510 align:middle line:84%
between a lot of these ancient
expressions of knowledge

00:16:15.510 --> 00:16:19.350 align:middle line:84%
and things like flying
vehicles in the sky

00:16:19.350 --> 00:16:22.770 align:middle line:84%
that many of these ancient
traditions in Daoism talk about.

00:16:22.770 --> 00:16:25.110 align:middle line:90%
Depictions of ships.

00:16:25.110 --> 00:16:30.170 align:middle line:84%
And these very special
beings called dragons.

00:16:30.170 --> 00:16:33.020 align:middle line:84%
And as I pulled
that thread more,

00:16:33.020 --> 00:16:35.120 align:middle line:84%
I started to realize
that not only

00:16:35.120 --> 00:16:38.258 align:middle line:84%
have I had interesting weird
experiences with dragons

00:16:38.258 --> 00:16:39.300 align:middle line:90%
since I was a little kid.

00:16:39.300 --> 00:16:40.300 align:middle line:90%
And I just love dragons.

00:16:40.300 --> 00:16:42.080 align:middle line:90%
I'd paint them and create them.

00:16:42.080 --> 00:16:45.230 align:middle line:84%
And it's just like so
sweet and innocent.

00:16:45.230 --> 00:16:46.970 align:middle line:90%
They're so beautiful.

00:16:46.970 --> 00:16:51.290 align:middle line:84%
And then I start to realize in
my big journey through my life

00:16:51.290 --> 00:16:55.970 align:middle line:84%
that I know all of these other
people who are also dragons.

00:16:55.970 --> 00:16:57.440 align:middle line:84%
And they're so
playful and they're

00:16:57.440 --> 00:17:00.110 align:middle line:84%
so excited when
they get found out.

00:17:00.110 --> 00:17:02.620 align:middle line:90%
They're like, I'm a dragon too.

00:17:02.620 --> 00:17:03.840 align:middle line:90%
I'm like you're here too.

00:17:03.840 --> 00:17:04.640 align:middle line:90%
Like yeah.

00:17:04.640 --> 00:17:06.829 align:middle line:90%
Here to protect this world.

00:17:06.829 --> 00:17:08.750 align:middle line:90%
Here to protect all life.

00:17:08.750 --> 00:17:10.819 align:middle line:90%
Here to serve the good.

00:17:10.819 --> 00:17:14.010 align:middle line:84%
Every dragon I know
that knows themselves,

00:17:14.010 --> 00:17:18.260 align:middle line:84%
they are some of the most
deeply, loving, serving

00:17:18.260 --> 00:17:20.930 align:middle line:90%
guardians I have ever met.

00:17:20.930 --> 00:17:22.430 align:middle line:84%
And I got really
fascinated by that.

00:17:22.430 --> 00:17:23.960 align:middle line:90%
Dragons as guardians.

00:17:23.960 --> 00:17:26.750 align:middle line:84%
And interesting, you look at all
these ancient cultures talking

00:17:26.750 --> 00:17:28.708 align:middle line:84%
about dragons and the
way do they talk to them.

00:17:28.708 --> 00:17:30.240 align:middle line:90%
They protect the temple.

00:17:30.240 --> 00:17:32.550 align:middle line:90%
They guard the sacred places.

00:17:32.550 --> 00:17:35.220 align:middle line:84%
So yeah, I mean
things like dragons

00:17:35.220 --> 00:17:36.820 align:middle line:90%
are really misunderstood.

00:17:36.820 --> 00:17:39.930 align:middle line:10%
So it turns out with all
of these memories of all

00:17:39.930 --> 00:17:43.440 align:middle line:10%
of these people, there's a
connection between dragons

00:17:43.440 --> 00:17:47.700 align:middle line:10%
and Orion, and a connection
within Orion and this thing

00:17:47.700 --> 00:17:49.560 align:middle line:10%
called the Orion wars.

00:17:49.560 --> 00:17:51.090 align:middle line:84%
Now there's all
these people that I

00:17:51.090 --> 00:17:54.270 align:middle line:84%
started finding that have these
memories of being on this desert

00:17:54.270 --> 00:17:56.670 align:middle line:90%
planet that's near Betelgeuse.

00:17:56.670 --> 00:18:00.690 align:middle line:84%
And this desert planet, when
they watch things like dune,

00:18:00.690 --> 00:18:03.645 align:middle line:84%
Frank Herbert was tapping
into something there.

00:18:03.645 --> 00:18:06.330 align:middle line:84%
He was tuning into some
kind of information.

00:18:06.330 --> 00:18:08.520 align:middle line:84%
And this place,
this desert planet

00:18:08.520 --> 00:18:10.500 align:middle line:90%
also had a water like planet.

00:18:10.500 --> 00:18:13.770 align:middle line:10%
And everyone I know that has
memories from this place,

00:18:13.770 --> 00:18:19.480 align:middle line:10%
they all feel the deep, intense
loss of having lost a planet.

00:18:19.480 --> 00:18:22.590 align:middle line:10%
And I can tell you
in my heart right now

00:18:22.590 --> 00:18:26.040 align:middle line:10%
as it aches as I speak about
this, that's a big loss.

00:18:26.040 --> 00:18:27.630 align:middle line:90%
That is a big loss.

00:18:27.630 --> 00:18:29.970 align:middle line:84%
That is one you never
want to have to go through

00:18:29.970 --> 00:18:31.470 align:middle line:90%
ever again as a soul.

00:18:31.470 --> 00:18:33.580 align:middle line:90%
You don't want to lose a planet.

00:18:33.580 --> 00:18:36.740 align:middle line:90%
It's like Yeah, too intense.

00:18:36.740 --> 00:18:40.050 align:middle line:84%
And this planetary system
where these beings come from,

00:18:40.050 --> 00:18:42.590 align:middle line:90%
we call it Shihaeli.

00:18:42.590 --> 00:18:45.650 align:middle line:10%
And the Shihaeli desert
planet is this beautiful place

00:18:45.650 --> 00:18:50.840 align:middle line:10%
of crystalline white cities
and plasma like deserts, quite

00:18:50.840 --> 00:18:52.290 align:middle line:10%
an amazing place.

00:18:52.290 --> 00:18:54.800 align:middle line:84%
But the people there, the
culture that they practice

00:18:54.800 --> 00:18:57.170 align:middle line:84%
is actually very
much like Daoism.

00:18:57.170 --> 00:19:01.640 align:middle line:84%
You could almost think of
it as like Galactic samurai

00:19:01.640 --> 00:19:03.440 align:middle line:90%
but with oracles.

00:19:03.440 --> 00:19:06.568 align:middle line:84%
And so you have
oracles and samurai,

00:19:06.568 --> 00:19:07.610 align:middle line:90%
these interesting people.

00:19:07.610 --> 00:19:10.560 align:middle line:84%
And all my friends like
that are like that.

00:19:10.560 --> 00:19:14.300 align:middle line:84%
And underneath this desert are
these amazing bioluminescent

00:19:14.300 --> 00:19:15.530 align:middle line:90%
crystal caverns.

00:19:15.530 --> 00:19:18.440 align:middle line:84%
These bioluminescent crystal
caverns are full of life.

00:19:18.440 --> 00:19:19.820 align:middle line:90%
They grow life in there.

00:19:19.820 --> 00:19:22.290 align:middle line:84%
You grow all kinds of
things inside of it.

00:19:22.290 --> 00:19:25.610 align:middle line:84%
And these become the
resources for that people

00:19:25.610 --> 00:19:27.500 align:middle line:90%
and for their way of operating.

00:19:27.500 --> 00:19:30.560 align:middle line:84%
And they're basically
orientalish looking.

00:19:30.560 --> 00:19:34.010 align:middle line:84%
And I started to find through
all of this transpersonal work

00:19:34.010 --> 00:19:36.780 align:middle line:84%
with all these different
people and kind of deep diving

00:19:36.780 --> 00:19:39.240 align:middle line:84%
and some of them do
QHHT, some of them

00:19:39.240 --> 00:19:41.340 align:middle line:84%
do Dolores Cannon's
method with that.

00:19:41.340 --> 00:19:43.590 align:middle line:84%
Others do other kinds
of hypnosis, other kinds

00:19:43.590 --> 00:19:44.910 align:middle line:90%
of past life regression.

00:19:44.910 --> 00:19:47.800 align:middle line:84%
And they've come to
access this information.

00:19:47.800 --> 00:19:49.710 align:middle line:84%
And I put the
information together

00:19:49.710 --> 00:19:50.890 align:middle line:90%
with my own information.

00:19:50.890 --> 00:19:52.950 align:middle line:84%
And I thought, well,
hey, maybe that's

00:19:52.950 --> 00:19:56.820 align:middle line:84%
the root of some of the oriental
bloodlines on this Earth.

00:19:56.820 --> 00:20:00.120 align:middle line:84%
Maybe the Oriental
race essentially

00:20:00.120 --> 00:20:03.030 align:middle line:84%
is part of this
Galactic community

00:20:03.030 --> 00:20:04.860 align:middle line:90%
that came here a long time ago.

00:20:04.860 --> 00:20:08.370 align:middle line:84%
Maybe that's why all the
stories of the high level

00:20:08.370 --> 00:20:09.870 align:middle line:90%
martial artist masters.

00:20:09.870 --> 00:20:13.500 align:middle line:84%
What happens is they go,
they leave being a farmer,

00:20:13.500 --> 00:20:16.710 align:middle line:84%
their village is being burned,
they go up into the mountains,

00:20:16.710 --> 00:20:20.130 align:middle line:84%
they go up into the mountains
and something happens.

00:20:20.130 --> 00:20:21.840 align:middle line:90%
They come back down.

00:20:21.840 --> 00:20:24.270 align:middle line:84%
They've got all these
skills, all this ability,

00:20:24.270 --> 00:20:26.080 align:middle line:90%
all this knowledge.

00:20:26.080 --> 00:20:27.960 align:middle line:90%
Where did that come from?

00:20:27.960 --> 00:20:30.330 align:middle line:84%
And just so you know,
I'm not BSing you.

00:20:30.330 --> 00:20:34.980 align:middle line:84%
Here's some of my Galactic
homie Shihaeli samurai friends

00:20:34.980 --> 00:20:37.063 align:middle line:84%
who literally dress
up as Galactic samurai

00:20:37.063 --> 00:20:38.730 align:middle line:84%
and go out into the
middle of the desert

00:20:38.730 --> 00:20:42.510 align:middle line:84%
and ride around a
Golden Dragon, just

00:20:42.510 --> 00:20:45.810 align:middle line:90%
to make the point real strong.

00:20:45.810 --> 00:20:50.400 align:middle line:84%
And of course, my other friends,
female friends who are Shihaeli.

00:20:50.400 --> 00:20:52.720 align:middle line:84%
Anybody here read
the Sophia Code?

00:20:52.720 --> 00:20:53.520 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:20:53.520 --> 00:20:57.000 align:middle line:84%
Kaia Ra, she was my mother
when I was Shihaeli.

00:20:57.000 --> 00:20:58.590 align:middle line:90%
Amazing oracle.

00:20:58.590 --> 00:21:02.660 align:middle line:10%
Teaches about the
Sofia Dragon tribe.

00:21:02.660 --> 00:21:08.180 align:middle line:84%
And there's a shadow
here too, because it was

00:21:08.180 --> 00:21:10.760 align:middle line:90%
this world that was destroyed.

00:21:10.760 --> 00:21:13.310 align:middle line:84%
The reason it was destroyed
and how it was destroyed

00:21:13.310 --> 00:21:17.510 align:middle line:84%
was from an assault
of beings that we all

00:21:17.510 --> 00:21:20.930 align:middle line:90%
popularly call the reptilians.

00:21:20.930 --> 00:21:24.020 align:middle line:84%
But it turns out there's
a deeper secret to that,

00:21:24.020 --> 00:21:26.510 align:middle line:84%
because what actually
happened was that there

00:21:26.510 --> 00:21:28.790 align:middle line:90%
was dragons in Andromeda.

00:21:28.790 --> 00:21:32.570 align:middle line:84%
And the Dragons in Andromeda
had their DNA stolen.

00:21:32.570 --> 00:21:35.660 align:middle line:84%
And that DNA was
brought and turned

00:21:35.660 --> 00:21:39.980 align:middle line:84%
into a hybrid of
humanoid dragon.

00:21:39.980 --> 00:21:46.200 align:middle line:84%
And that humanoid dragon hybrid
is what we call a reptilian.

00:21:46.200 --> 00:21:51.160 align:middle line:84%
But it turns out that pissed
the dragons off big time.

00:21:51.160 --> 00:21:53.640 align:middle line:84%
And so there were some
dragons who literally

00:21:53.640 --> 00:21:57.060 align:middle line:84%
came to this galaxy incarnated
into these bodies that

00:21:57.060 --> 00:21:59.100 align:middle line:84%
were these hybrid messed
up bodies that were not

00:21:59.100 --> 00:21:59.970 align:middle line:90%
like their old bodies.

00:21:59.970 --> 00:22:01.290 align:middle line:84%
They couldn't
remember everything.

00:22:01.290 --> 00:22:02.832 align:middle line:84%
But the one thing
they could remember

00:22:02.832 --> 00:22:07.020 align:middle line:84%
is they wanted to destroy those
humanoids that had taken them

00:22:07.020 --> 00:22:09.890 align:middle line:90%
from their home world.

00:22:09.890 --> 00:22:13.430 align:middle line:84%
And I share that because
there's a lot of people

00:22:13.430 --> 00:22:15.770 align:middle line:84%
that fearmonger about
reptilians and are

00:22:15.770 --> 00:22:17.090 align:middle line:90%
afraid of all kinds of things.

00:22:17.090 --> 00:22:18.510 align:middle line:90%
Different species.

00:22:18.510 --> 00:22:21.110 align:middle line:84%
And we often say
that's the evil.

00:22:21.110 --> 00:22:22.500 align:middle line:90%
That's the bad.

00:22:22.500 --> 00:22:24.560 align:middle line:84%
But when we really
start to look at it,

00:22:24.560 --> 00:22:28.610 align:middle line:84%
isn't it true that
almost every great act

00:22:28.610 --> 00:22:30.680 align:middle line:84%
of evil we've ever
seen on this planet

00:22:30.680 --> 00:22:34.010 align:middle line:90%
came from an origin of trauma?

00:22:34.010 --> 00:22:36.420 align:middle line:90%
Do you agree with me on that?

00:22:36.420 --> 00:22:39.320 align:middle line:10%
Can you understand
that when we go out

00:22:39.320 --> 00:22:42.200 align:middle line:10%
to kill and attack and
fight each other, oftentimes

00:22:42.200 --> 00:22:44.540 align:middle line:10%
it's because we've
already been wounded.

00:22:44.540 --> 00:22:47.210 align:middle line:84%
And the wounds are
left festering.

00:22:47.210 --> 00:22:49.010 align:middle line:10%
And sometimes
those wounds happen

00:22:49.010 --> 00:22:52.500 align:middle line:10%
after generation and generation
and generation and generation,

00:22:52.500 --> 00:22:54.620 align:middle line:10%
we can see it
right now happening

00:22:54.620 --> 00:22:56.690 align:middle line:10%
with Israel and Palestine.

00:22:56.690 --> 00:22:59.040 align:middle line:10%
It is not a one-sided equation.

00:22:59.040 --> 00:23:00.780 align:middle line:10%
It is not a right or wrong.

00:23:00.780 --> 00:23:03.350 align:middle line:10%
It is actually a
deep wound that needs

00:23:03.350 --> 00:23:05.480 align:middle line:10%
to be healed on both sides.

00:23:05.480 --> 00:23:08.160 align:middle line:84%
This is critical to our
evolution as a people,

00:23:08.160 --> 00:23:10.710 align:middle line:90%
as a species.

00:23:10.710 --> 00:23:12.540 align:middle line:84%
If we go into
Tibetan Buddhism, we

00:23:12.540 --> 00:23:16.530 align:middle line:84%
see lots of representations of
dragons as beauty and guardians.

00:23:16.530 --> 00:23:18.430 align:middle line:90%
But we also can see the wrath.

00:23:18.430 --> 00:23:20.010 align:middle line:90%
We can also see the intensity.

00:23:20.010 --> 00:23:23.310 align:middle line:10%
And the kinds of
conflicts that have

00:23:23.310 --> 00:23:25.080 align:middle line:10%
happened throughout the galaxy.

00:23:25.080 --> 00:23:28.020 align:middle line:84%
I believe in Tibet
and Buddhism and a lot

00:23:28.020 --> 00:23:29.760 align:middle line:84%
of the Tibetan
thangkas, which I worked

00:23:29.760 --> 00:23:32.730 align:middle line:84%
with Romio Shrestha, the
ninth incarnation of Arniko

00:23:32.730 --> 00:23:34.170 align:middle line:90%
for many, many years.

00:23:34.170 --> 00:23:37.500 align:middle line:84%
And he showed me the backs
of many of these thangkas.

00:23:37.500 --> 00:23:40.800 align:middle line:84%
And they have star
grids on the backs.

00:23:40.800 --> 00:23:44.417 align:middle line:84%
There's like star nation
wisdom so baked into it

00:23:44.417 --> 00:23:46.500 align:middle line:84%
that they don't even--
they don't flinch about it.

00:23:46.500 --> 00:23:48.390 align:middle line:84%
I mean, the Dalai Lama has
been asked straight up.

00:23:48.390 --> 00:23:50.557 align:middle line:84%
Did you guys get information
from extraterrestrials?

00:23:50.557 --> 00:23:53.290 align:middle line:84%
And he's like, Yeah,
a long time ago.

00:23:53.290 --> 00:23:54.850 align:middle line:90%
It's been a while.

00:23:54.850 --> 00:23:56.860 align:middle line:84%
I mean, but you look
at their paintings

00:23:56.860 --> 00:23:59.600 align:middle line:84%
and they have all
of this in there.

00:23:59.600 --> 00:24:03.070 align:middle line:84%
And so it's not really
that surprising.

00:24:03.070 --> 00:24:07.450 align:middle line:84%
And it was John Mack by the
way, the psychiatrist who

00:24:07.450 --> 00:24:10.387 align:middle line:84%
had conversations with
the Dalai Lama, 1992,

00:24:10.387 --> 00:24:12.220 align:middle line:84%
and he confirmed that
they'd been in contact

00:24:12.220 --> 00:24:13.400 align:middle line:90%
with extraterrestrials.

00:24:13.400 --> 00:24:14.900 align:middle line:84%
So if you're curious
about that, you

00:24:14.900 --> 00:24:17.770 align:middle line:84%
can just look up John Mark
and Dalai Lama's work.

00:24:17.770 --> 00:24:21.190 align:middle line:84%
But it's not isolated to
these obscure cultures

00:24:21.190 --> 00:24:23.140 align:middle line:90%
or the oriental cultures.

00:24:23.140 --> 00:24:25.270 align:middle line:84%
We see it throughout
medieval art.

00:24:25.270 --> 00:24:26.650 align:middle line:90%
We see the Roman Empire.

00:24:26.650 --> 00:24:29.230 align:middle line:90%
We see these depictions of God.

00:24:29.230 --> 00:24:32.860 align:middle line:84%
And we see the
depictions of starships.

00:24:32.860 --> 00:24:35.268 align:middle line:84%
I saw-- just told
me the other day

00:24:35.268 --> 00:24:37.810 align:middle line:84%
sharing these same things with
the summer solstice and winter

00:24:37.810 --> 00:24:38.710 align:middle line:90%
solstice.

00:24:38.710 --> 00:24:42.910 align:middle line:84%
You guys have seen this stuff
probably, as well as concepts

00:24:42.910 --> 00:24:44.950 align:middle line:90%
like Jesus walking on water.

00:24:44.950 --> 00:24:46.570 align:middle line:90%
Well, interesting.

00:24:46.570 --> 00:24:51.340 align:middle line:84%
Walking on water, leap of faith,
Holy Grail, all of these things,

00:24:51.340 --> 00:24:53.950 align:middle line:84%
where do we find
powerful links to that?

00:24:53.950 --> 00:24:57.140 align:middle line:10%
In the people that have
connections to the Pleiades.

00:24:57.140 --> 00:25:00.140 align:middle line:84%
And there's initiation
processes that

00:25:00.140 --> 00:25:03.170 align:middle line:84%
Pleiadians I know talk
about where they literally

00:25:03.170 --> 00:25:05.370 align:middle line:84%
had to learn how to
sing to the water

00:25:05.370 --> 00:25:09.230 align:middle line:84%
so they could walk on the water
to go out to a sacred temple

00:25:09.230 --> 00:25:11.510 align:middle line:84%
out in the end of
the water and go up

00:25:11.510 --> 00:25:14.210 align:middle line:84%
into that temple and
experience something

00:25:14.210 --> 00:25:15.920 align:middle line:90%
akin to a leap of faith.

00:25:15.920 --> 00:25:18.230 align:middle line:84%
And I have this
memory too because I

00:25:18.230 --> 00:25:21.530 align:middle line:84%
was Pleiadian at one point and
I had this memory spontaneously

00:25:21.530 --> 00:25:24.530 align:middle line:84%
of being walking in the
water, walking up this temple,

00:25:24.530 --> 00:25:25.790 align:middle line:90%
going into this space.

00:25:25.790 --> 00:25:30.020 align:middle line:84%
And there's this hole where
there's this vortex going down

00:25:30.020 --> 00:25:30.890 align:middle line:90%
into the water.

00:25:30.890 --> 00:25:32.480 align:middle line:84%
And there's these beings
standing around me

00:25:32.480 --> 00:25:33.280 align:middle line:90%
on the upper thing.

00:25:33.280 --> 00:25:35.097 align:middle line:90%
And I step off leap of faith.

00:25:35.097 --> 00:25:36.680 align:middle line:84%
It's the only thing
I have left to do.

00:25:36.680 --> 00:25:39.110 align:middle line:84%
And the water wraps
around me, creates an egg,

00:25:39.110 --> 00:25:40.310 align:middle line:90%
and ejects me out the top.

00:25:40.310 --> 00:25:41.900 align:middle line:90%
I fly up into the sky.

00:25:41.900 --> 00:25:43.490 align:middle line:90%
I'm shooting through the stars.

00:25:43.490 --> 00:25:47.450 align:middle line:84%
And then I fly into a giant
whale-looking mothership, come

00:25:47.450 --> 00:25:51.230 align:middle line:84%
in there, and land, the
water falls off of me.

00:25:51.230 --> 00:25:53.060 align:middle line:84%
And I have no idea
what's going on

00:25:53.060 --> 00:25:55.880 align:middle line:84%
because I thought that I was
just a being on a little water

00:25:55.880 --> 00:25:56.680 align:middle line:90%
planet.

00:25:56.680 --> 00:25:58.550 align:middle line:84%
And it turns out that
my species is actually

00:25:58.550 --> 00:26:00.860 align:middle line:84%
a super advanced
Galactic civilization

00:26:00.860 --> 00:26:03.440 align:middle line:90%
that now I'm a part of.

00:26:03.440 --> 00:26:06.980 align:middle line:90%
Whoa, Pleiadians are wild, man.

00:26:06.980 --> 00:26:10.160 align:middle line:84%
And you meet Pleiadians and
they all have the same wisdom.

00:26:10.160 --> 00:26:13.700 align:middle line:84%
This water, this resonance,
this understanding of sound.

00:26:13.700 --> 00:26:18.110 align:middle line:84%
These keys to sound
harmonics and water as memory

00:26:18.110 --> 00:26:21.900 align:middle line:84%
is such a deep part of
the Pleiadian culture.

00:26:21.900 --> 00:26:25.490 align:middle line:10%
So maybe some of that sound
medicine and resonance

00:26:25.490 --> 00:26:28.400 align:middle line:10%
made its way here
through a vast variety

00:26:28.400 --> 00:26:31.340 align:middle line:10%
of different cultures from the
Aboriginal cultures to the Hindu

00:26:31.340 --> 00:26:33.560 align:middle line:10%
to the Native Americans
to the Polynesians

00:26:33.560 --> 00:26:37.970 align:middle line:10%
and many others who recognize
this star system as one

00:26:37.970 --> 00:26:41.530 align:middle line:10%
of their places of origin.

00:26:41.530 --> 00:26:44.980 align:middle line:84%
If we go down into the
Amazon, we find Amazonian art

00:26:44.980 --> 00:26:49.360 align:middle line:84%
where the ayahuasqueros talk
about these Galactic beings.

00:26:49.360 --> 00:26:52.030 align:middle line:10%
You've got 40,000
different plant species.

00:26:52.030 --> 00:26:53.800 align:middle line:10%
Only two of them make ayahuasca.

00:26:53.800 --> 00:26:56.800 align:middle line:10%
And yet somehow they
found ayahuasca.

00:26:56.800 --> 00:26:59.080 align:middle line:84%
And ayahuasca opens
up these doors

00:26:59.080 --> 00:27:00.820 align:middle line:84%
and these portals in
your consciousness

00:27:00.820 --> 00:27:03.350 align:middle line:84%
in order to be able to see
all of these amazing Galactic

00:27:03.350 --> 00:27:04.150 align:middle line:90%
spaces.

00:27:04.150 --> 00:27:08.200 align:middle line:10%
And so you have this star
species called the Yahonians

00:27:08.200 --> 00:27:10.570 align:middle line:10%
that many people
have memories of.

00:27:10.570 --> 00:27:13.750 align:middle line:84%
That's basically a Galactic
jungle system, marshes,

00:27:13.750 --> 00:27:17.620 align:middle line:84%
biospheres, all of
these things using trees

00:27:17.620 --> 00:27:20.560 align:middle line:84%
as mammillary bodies,
and essentially that

00:27:20.560 --> 00:27:24.850 align:middle line:90%
are masters of plant medicines.

00:27:24.850 --> 00:27:27.430 align:middle line:84%
And so those with the
resonance with this culture

00:27:27.430 --> 00:27:31.180 align:middle line:84%
and this species have
experienced the magic of plants

00:27:31.180 --> 00:27:33.520 align:middle line:90%
as one of our greatest teachers.

00:27:33.520 --> 00:27:36.640 align:middle line:84%
You've got the Vimanas in
India which are essentially

00:27:36.640 --> 00:27:38.470 align:middle line:90%
different kinds of spacecraft.

00:27:38.470 --> 00:27:41.420 align:middle line:84%
And they have Vimanas
that travel on Earth

00:27:41.420 --> 00:27:43.160 align:middle line:84%
and ones that
travel in the stars.

00:27:43.160 --> 00:27:44.960 align:middle line:84%
And the people that
created the Vimanas,

00:27:44.960 --> 00:27:47.810 align:middle line:84%
they were said to be a Galactic
race that could vibrate in

00:27:47.810 --> 00:27:49.530 align:middle line:90%
and out of the physical body.

00:27:49.530 --> 00:27:51.710 align:middle line:84%
And it turns out that there
are people with memories

00:27:51.710 --> 00:27:54.380 align:middle line:84%
from a system
around Cassiopeia-A,

00:27:54.380 --> 00:28:00.050 align:middle line:84%
which went supernova that
knew exactly how to do this.

00:28:00.050 --> 00:28:04.280 align:middle line:84%
Your planet dies because
your star goes supernova.

00:28:04.280 --> 00:28:06.590 align:middle line:84%
You're probably a pretty
advanced civilization

00:28:06.590 --> 00:28:07.700 align:middle line:90%
by that point.

00:28:07.700 --> 00:28:08.990 align:middle line:90%
Am I right?

00:28:08.990 --> 00:28:13.100 align:middle line:84%
And finally, the Dogon
and the Tuatha Dé Danann.

00:28:13.100 --> 00:28:17.600 align:middle line:84%
The Dogon tribe in Africa, they
talk about Star people called

00:28:17.600 --> 00:28:21.920 align:middle line:84%
the Nomos that came in dolphin
bodies, made pools of water,

00:28:21.920 --> 00:28:24.770 align:middle line:84%
swam up to them, and
then transmitted to them

00:28:24.770 --> 00:28:26.120 align:middle line:90%
where they were from.

00:28:26.120 --> 00:28:29.330 align:middle line:84%
And they transmitted it
so exactly and precisely

00:28:29.330 --> 00:28:32.660 align:middle line:84%
that the Dogon were able
to draw on their cave wall

00:28:32.660 --> 00:28:35.120 align:middle line:84%
the exact rotation
between Sirius A

00:28:35.120 --> 00:28:39.740 align:middle line:84%
and B in the astronomical
diagram, which was not even

00:28:39.740 --> 00:28:42.800 align:middle line:90%
discovered until the 1980s.

00:28:42.800 --> 00:28:45.680 align:middle line:84%
And then you've got
guys like JRR Tolkien.

00:28:45.680 --> 00:28:48.230 align:middle line:84%
How many Lord of the
Rings fans out there can

00:28:48.230 --> 00:28:49.820 align:middle line:84%
rep with the
awesomeness of Tolkien

00:28:49.820 --> 00:28:51.020 align:middle line:90%
and the Lord of the Rings?

00:28:51.020 --> 00:28:54.740 align:middle line:84%
Well, it turns out Tolkien
started having visions

00:28:54.740 --> 00:28:57.350 align:middle line:84%
as he was trying to
create a new language.

00:28:57.350 --> 00:28:58.950 align:middle line:90%
He wasn't an author.

00:28:58.950 --> 00:29:01.440 align:middle line:90%
He was all about language.

00:29:01.440 --> 00:29:03.200 align:middle line:84%
And he was getting
these downloads

00:29:03.200 --> 00:29:05.990 align:middle line:84%
about the species that
spoke this language.

00:29:05.990 --> 00:29:07.970 align:middle line:84%
And the species that
spoke this language

00:29:07.970 --> 00:29:11.030 align:middle line:84%
were the people from
a land of eternal sun

00:29:11.030 --> 00:29:14.390 align:middle line:84%
that crossed the great
waters to Middle Earth.

00:29:14.390 --> 00:29:17.870 align:middle line:84%
These were the
stories of the Elves.

00:29:17.870 --> 00:29:21.650 align:middle line:84%
And right here on Earth, we
have stories about those Elves,

00:29:21.650 --> 00:29:23.840 align:middle line:84%
they're called the
Tuatha Dé Danann.

00:29:23.840 --> 00:29:28.130 align:middle line:84%
They arrived in the British
Isles, riding clouds.

00:29:28.130 --> 00:29:30.800 align:middle line:84%
And they landed on
the Iron Mountain.

00:29:30.800 --> 00:29:33.710 align:middle line:10%
And they brought with them
the four sacred treasures

00:29:33.710 --> 00:29:36.440 align:middle line:10%
from the three
islands in the sky.

00:29:36.440 --> 00:29:38.960 align:middle line:10%
And those four
sacred treasures--

00:29:38.960 --> 00:29:43.160 align:middle line:10%
the cauldron of the Dagda,
the sword of light of Nuada,

00:29:43.160 --> 00:29:46.160 align:middle line:10%
the stone of Fal, and
the spear of Lugh.

00:29:46.160 --> 00:29:49.730 align:middle line:10%
And these four sacred
artifacts essentially

00:29:49.730 --> 00:29:56.540 align:middle line:10%
are the roots of our tarot
and our playing card system.

00:29:56.540 --> 00:30:01.920 align:middle line:84%
You've got swords, wands,
pentacles is the stone,

00:30:01.920 --> 00:30:06.740 align:middle line:84%
and cups, which is the
cauldron or the sacred Chalice.

00:30:06.740 --> 00:30:11.330 align:middle line:84%
So the culture of these
advanced extraterrestrial races,

00:30:11.330 --> 00:30:17.850 align:middle line:84%
these Galactic families
is actually our cultures.

00:30:17.850 --> 00:30:20.010 align:middle line:90%
It's who we are.

00:30:20.010 --> 00:30:22.080 align:middle line:84%
And those from
the Sirian system,

00:30:22.080 --> 00:30:24.480 align:middle line:84%
those Elves who grew
up in a dual sun

00:30:24.480 --> 00:30:28.740 align:middle line:84%
system with amazing citadels
and endless tree forests

00:30:28.740 --> 00:30:31.230 align:middle line:84%
and trees so large to
protect from the two

00:30:31.230 --> 00:30:34.650 align:middle line:84%
suns and these cities
in the wilderness,

00:30:34.650 --> 00:30:37.590 align:middle line:84%
places that when we watch
things like Lord of the Rings

00:30:37.590 --> 00:30:40.530 align:middle line:84%
and you see Rivendell, your
whole body lights up because you

00:30:40.530 --> 00:30:43.120 align:middle line:90%
know just like that.

00:30:43.120 --> 00:30:45.720 align:middle line:90%
You know it is your home.

00:30:45.720 --> 00:30:50.460 align:middle line:84%
That is the level of connection
and heart centered impartment

00:30:50.460 --> 00:30:52.410 align:middle line:84%
I want to leave you
with here tonight,

00:30:52.410 --> 00:30:56.610 align:middle line:84%
because I want you to understand
that it's not about us being

00:30:56.610 --> 00:30:59.580 align:middle line:84%
here on Earth as some
weird isolated species

00:30:59.580 --> 00:31:01.800 align:middle line:84%
blacklisted by the
rest of the galaxy.

00:31:01.800 --> 00:31:06.420 align:middle line:84%
It's about all of us, many of
us being star nation coming

00:31:06.420 --> 00:31:10.170 align:middle line:84%
to this planet and now finally
helping this planet's body

00:31:10.170 --> 00:31:14.790 align:middle line:84%
and energetics come to maturity
so that we can have the greatest

00:31:14.790 --> 00:31:17.980 align:middle line:90%
family reunion ever imagined.

00:31:17.980 --> 00:31:20.830 align:middle line:84%
And as we go forth
into the stars,

00:31:20.830 --> 00:31:25.060 align:middle line:84%
as we become the Galactic
culture that we are destined

00:31:25.060 --> 00:31:29.350 align:middle line:84%
to be and become the stewards
of this planet that has always

00:31:29.350 --> 00:31:32.800 align:middle line:84%
been our birthright, not
to just care for humans,

00:31:32.800 --> 00:31:34.810 align:middle line:90%
but to care for all life.

00:31:34.810 --> 00:31:38.860 align:middle line:84%
And that I will give my
life for is the stewardship

00:31:38.860 --> 00:31:39.880 align:middle line:90%
of this world.

00:31:39.880 --> 00:31:41.710 align:middle line:84%
And I hope that
you'll join me in that

00:31:41.710 --> 00:31:43.600 align:middle line:84%
and become part of
this Galactic family.

00:31:43.600 --> 00:31:44.540 align:middle line:90%
Thank you so much.

00:31:44.540 --> 00:31:45.340 align:middle line:90%
Good night.
