00:00:04.900 --> 00:00:08.330 align:middle line:90%
[THEME MUSIC]

00:00:08.330 --> 00:00:11.290 align:middle line:90%


00:00:11.290 --> 00:00:12.720 align:middle line:90%
>> Great to see you all.

00:00:12.720 --> 00:00:17.770 align:middle line:10%
I'm very, very
passionate about this.

00:00:17.770 --> 00:00:21.530 align:middle line:84%
Obsessed, actually,
about how amazing we are.

00:00:21.530 --> 00:00:25.210 align:middle line:10%
So, are we the quantum
computers we're searching for?

00:00:25.210 --> 00:00:29.170 align:middle line:90%
Spoiler alert-- yes, absolutely.

00:00:29.170 --> 00:00:32.570 align:middle line:10%
Probably a lot of you here
already feel that way.

00:00:32.570 --> 00:00:34.240 align:middle line:10%
Something's happened
in your life,

00:00:34.240 --> 00:00:37.190 align:middle line:10%
and your doors have
been blasted open,

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:40.570 align:middle line:10%
and you know that the reality
that we are being told about

00:00:40.570 --> 00:00:42.380 align:middle line:10%
is not the whole story.

00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:44.560 align:middle line:84%
And you've probably spent
a lot of your life trying

00:00:44.560 --> 00:00:47.930 align:middle line:84%
to put a framework around this
and figure this out on your own.

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:50.560 align:middle line:10%
My presentations
speak to everyone,

00:00:50.560 --> 00:00:53.950 align:middle line:10%
so I tend to be a little
conservative of what I

00:00:53.950 --> 00:00:57.850 align:middle line:10%
say in my presentations so
that I don't isolate anybody.

00:00:57.850 --> 00:01:00.310 align:middle line:10%
But I like to look at
this through the lens

00:01:00.310 --> 00:01:04.330 align:middle line:10%
of my own experiences
with remote viewing,

00:01:04.330 --> 00:01:07.090 align:middle line:10%
just because I think
it gives us more

00:01:07.090 --> 00:01:11.060 align:middle line:10%
of a holistic perspective when
we're looking at ourselves

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:13.080 align:middle line:10%
and how amazing we are.

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:16.430 align:middle line:10%
So as many of you
know, if you're

00:01:16.430 --> 00:01:19.940 align:middle line:10%
coming to this conference,
we are standing right now

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:24.170 align:middle line:10%
on the precipice of
this incredible time

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:27.140 align:middle line:10%
in humanity's lifetime.

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:29.840 align:middle line:10%
We're having the
convergence right

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:34.370 align:middle line:10%
now of artificial
intelligence, of course.

00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:38.100 align:middle line:10%
We're going to have quantum
computers coming online soon.

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:41.070 align:middle line:10%
We have genetic manipulation.

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:43.850 align:middle line:10%
Scientists right
now are actually

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:48.140 align:middle line:10%
looking at adding
additional senses to humans.

00:01:48.140 --> 00:01:49.470 align:middle line:90%
This is going on.

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:52.370 align:middle line:84%
So this is why I love
to keep my fingers

00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:54.770 align:middle line:84%
on the pulse of
neuroscience and science

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:58.670 align:middle line:84%
as best I can because I
feel like these things that

00:01:58.670 --> 00:02:00.140 align:middle line:90%
are happening.

00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:01.650 align:middle line:90%
I mean, they're happening.

00:02:01.650 --> 00:02:06.450 align:middle line:10%
But to be savvy humans, we
need to know about them.

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:10.259 align:middle line:10%
And we also need to
know how amazing we are,

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:14.720 align:middle line:10%
and that we are capable of so
much more than we think we are.

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:19.490 align:middle line:10%
So I put my glasses
on for part of this.

00:02:19.490 --> 00:02:21.880 align:middle line:10%
I just wanted to see
if I missed anything.

00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:26.290 align:middle line:84%
Well, there's also the
evolving ET reality, of course.

00:02:26.290 --> 00:02:29.170 align:middle line:10%
It would make sense
to me with everything

00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:32.350 align:middle line:10%
that's happening that they
would be watching us right now,

00:02:32.350 --> 00:02:33.410 align:middle line:10%
of course.

00:02:33.410 --> 00:02:36.630 align:middle line:10%
But then there's also all of the
abduction and close encounter

00:02:36.630 --> 00:02:37.430 align:middle line:10%
research.

00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:41.950 align:middle line:10%
And we've heard that they're
interested in the reproduction

00:02:41.950 --> 00:02:43.750 align:middle line:10%
and taking eggs,
and that they might

00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:46.360 align:middle line:10%
be working towards a
hybrid race-- that's

00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:47.960 align:middle line:10%
one of the theories.

00:02:47.960 --> 00:02:51.370 align:middle line:84%
But it also could be something--
that doesn't have to be

00:02:51.370 --> 00:02:53.320 align:middle line:90%
an or, this can be an and--

00:02:53.320 --> 00:02:57.250 align:middle line:84%
where they might be doing
a longitudinal study of us.

00:02:57.250 --> 00:03:02.350 align:middle line:84%
Whether we are related to them
or not, it seems rational to me

00:03:02.350 --> 00:03:06.280 align:middle line:84%
that an advanced civilization
would do something like this,

00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:08.630 align:middle line:84%
and they would study
us over the decades.

00:03:08.630 --> 00:03:13.360 align:middle line:10%
And of course, if we can imagine
that they are outside of time,

00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:16.240 align:middle line:10%
they may know something
about the future of humanity

00:03:16.240 --> 00:03:17.640 align:middle line:10%
that we don't know.

00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:23.660 align:middle line:10%
And could they be archiving
us through these decades

00:03:23.660 --> 00:03:28.640 align:middle line:10%
of our food being modified, our
incredible new technology coming

00:03:28.640 --> 00:03:31.142 align:middle line:10%
online, the genetic
manipulation?

00:03:31.142 --> 00:03:32.100 align:middle line:10%
Then we have Neuralink.

00:03:32.100 --> 00:03:33.480 align:middle line:10%
We're putting
things in our body.

00:03:33.480 --> 00:03:36.630 align:middle line:10%
We're trying to expand ourselves
in these artificial ways.

00:03:36.630 --> 00:03:39.630 align:middle line:84%
So could they know something
that we're going to do?

00:03:39.630 --> 00:03:42.290 align:middle line:84%
Maybe we are going to
be the ones that are not

00:03:42.290 --> 00:03:44.220 align:middle line:90%
going to be able to reproduce.

00:03:44.220 --> 00:03:46.740 align:middle line:10%
Could this just be
an archiving system?

00:03:46.740 --> 00:03:49.010 align:middle line:10%
I mean, sometimes people
bring up the fact,

00:03:49.010 --> 00:03:51.260 align:middle line:10%
well, they haven't
really done anything

00:03:51.260 --> 00:03:55.100 align:middle line:10%
to harm us other than it's
uninvited and some of us

00:03:55.100 --> 00:03:57.370 align:middle line:10%
are remembering these things.

00:03:57.370 --> 00:04:02.860 align:middle line:10%
But it just makes
sense to me that they

00:04:02.860 --> 00:04:08.530 align:middle line:10%
would be looking to keep
track of the genetic changes

00:04:08.530 --> 00:04:11.890 align:middle line:10%
and the epigenetic
changes as we move

00:04:11.890 --> 00:04:16.720 align:middle line:10%
through this new crazy biggest
time in humanity's timeline.

00:04:16.720 --> 00:04:20.050 align:middle line:10%
I mean, right now,
we can't even fathom

00:04:20.050 --> 00:04:23.800 align:middle line:10%
what is on the other end
of quantum computers coming

00:04:23.800 --> 00:04:25.570 align:middle line:10%
into the mix of this.

00:04:25.570 --> 00:04:29.350 align:middle line:84%
For me, it's really important
that we look at all of this

00:04:29.350 --> 00:04:33.400 align:middle line:84%
together, but we
also take a step back

00:04:33.400 --> 00:04:35.330 align:middle line:90%
and go, OK, what about us?

00:04:35.330 --> 00:04:38.230 align:middle line:10%
We have to be really careful
when all this AI comes online

00:04:38.230 --> 00:04:40.340 align:middle line:10%
that we don't make
that our new god.

00:04:40.340 --> 00:04:41.657 align:middle line:10%
And it's going to be tempting.

00:04:41.657 --> 00:04:42.740 align:middle line:10%
It's going to be tempting.

00:04:42.740 --> 00:04:45.092 align:middle line:10%
I mean, look at us with GPS.

00:04:45.092 --> 00:04:47.300 align:middle line:10%
Oh, yeah, I'm not going to
use that-- but look at us.

00:04:47.300 --> 00:04:49.460 align:middle line:10%
We all throw out
the maps with GPS.

00:04:49.460 --> 00:04:50.480 align:middle line:10%
Why wouldn't we use it?

00:04:50.480 --> 00:04:54.730 align:middle line:10%
I mean, as far as health, when
we see artificial intelligence

00:04:54.730 --> 00:04:58.330 align:middle line:10%
helping us with health and
amalgamating all the reports

00:04:58.330 --> 00:05:00.970 align:middle line:10%
and coming up with these
amazing solutions, I mean,

00:05:00.970 --> 00:05:02.840 align:middle line:10%
we're going to want it.

00:05:02.840 --> 00:05:03.890 align:middle line:10%
We just are.

00:05:03.890 --> 00:05:11.388 align:middle line:10%
So I just think we can adopt it
because we're going to have to.

00:05:11.388 --> 00:05:13.180 align:middle line:10%
I don't think we're
going to have a choice.

00:05:13.180 --> 00:05:17.050 align:middle line:10%
But I think we should never
stop looking at ourselves

00:05:17.050 --> 00:05:19.850 align:middle line:10%
and how we can evolve our minds.

00:05:19.850 --> 00:05:22.160 align:middle line:84%
So that's what my
presentation is about.

00:05:22.160 --> 00:05:23.960 align:middle line:90%
How can we evolve our minds?

00:05:23.960 --> 00:05:31.120 align:middle line:84%
I have been obsessed myself
with experimenting to see

00:05:31.120 --> 00:05:34.340 align:middle line:84%
what are the mysteries of
our minds, what can we do.

00:05:34.340 --> 00:05:35.470 align:middle line:90%
I always felt--

00:05:35.470 --> 00:05:37.420 align:middle line:90%
I'm sure many of you did--

00:05:37.420 --> 00:05:40.120 align:middle line:90%
very different inside.

00:05:40.120 --> 00:05:41.810 align:middle line:90%
Maybe it was intuition for you.

00:05:41.810 --> 00:05:43.820 align:middle line:84%
Maybe you were having
unusual dreams.

00:05:43.820 --> 00:05:46.850 align:middle line:10%
Maybe you were having
contact experiences.

00:05:46.850 --> 00:05:52.120 align:middle line:10%
But you know there's this
restlessness inside us

00:05:52.120 --> 00:05:56.000 align:middle line:10%
that tells us that
there is something more.

00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:58.260 align:middle line:10%
And we don't always
feel fulfilled.

00:05:58.260 --> 00:06:00.320 align:middle line:10%
I mean, we look at the
abduction research,

00:06:00.320 --> 00:06:02.510 align:middle line:10%
we look at the remote
viewing information.

00:06:02.510 --> 00:06:06.920 align:middle line:10%
But it's really important to
bring that inward and experiment

00:06:06.920 --> 00:06:08.060 align:middle line:10%
and try.

00:06:08.060 --> 00:06:14.610 align:middle line:10%
Break some new doorways open to
explore your own mind safely.

00:06:14.610 --> 00:06:18.080 align:middle line:10%
So I just want to talk about
this, how I've done it,

00:06:18.080 --> 00:06:20.570 align:middle line:10%
and hopefully give you
some suggestions about how

00:06:20.570 --> 00:06:22.450 align:middle line:10%
you might want to do it.

00:06:22.450 --> 00:06:24.960 align:middle line:10%
OK, I got a lot
of slides, so I'm

00:06:24.960 --> 00:06:28.780 align:middle line:10%
going to start
accelerating here.

00:06:28.780 --> 00:06:32.750 align:middle line:10%
The mind is more like a quantum
computer than a linear computer.

00:06:32.750 --> 00:06:36.550 align:middle line:10%
I didn't even realize that
the current scientific model

00:06:36.550 --> 00:06:40.473 align:middle line:10%
of the brain is
linear, algorithmic.

00:06:40.473 --> 00:06:41.890 align:middle line:10%
I mean, I can't
even believe that,

00:06:41.890 --> 00:06:44.210 align:middle line:10%
but that's what it currently is.

00:06:44.210 --> 00:06:49.280 align:middle line:84%
But to most of us, we know it's
more like a quantum computer.

00:06:49.280 --> 00:06:52.730 align:middle line:84%
There's hardly, I mean,
anything linear about it.

00:06:52.730 --> 00:06:56.020 align:middle line:84%
But we particularly
can examine this

00:06:56.020 --> 00:07:01.120 align:middle line:84%
through the lens of remote
viewing and precognition.

00:07:01.120 --> 00:07:03.100 align:middle line:10%
In artificial
intelligence, I believe

00:07:03.100 --> 00:07:05.170 align:middle line:10%
we are endeavoring
to build something

00:07:05.170 --> 00:07:07.660 align:middle line:10%
that we actually already have.

00:07:07.660 --> 00:07:10.270 align:middle line:10%
About which we know
next to nothing.

00:07:10.270 --> 00:07:13.370 align:middle line:10%
We still don't know half
the secrets of our minds.

00:07:13.370 --> 00:07:15.940 align:middle line:10%
They've been studying
the brain forever.

00:07:15.940 --> 00:07:19.300 align:middle line:10%
And all neuroscience,
psychology,

00:07:19.300 --> 00:07:22.190 align:middle line:10%
really is pattern recognition.

00:07:22.190 --> 00:07:27.060 align:middle line:84%
Still, at this stage, we
don't know very much about it.

00:07:27.060 --> 00:07:32.590 align:middle line:84%
So, how are we able to
have these psy experiences?

00:07:32.590 --> 00:07:34.020 align:middle line:10%
It's not explaining that.

00:07:34.020 --> 00:07:36.070 align:middle line:10%
What's happening during dreams?

00:07:36.070 --> 00:07:38.420 align:middle line:10%
We still don't know this.

00:07:38.420 --> 00:07:40.170 align:middle line:84%
We don't know where
we're going for death.

00:07:40.170 --> 00:07:41.795 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I can't
believe we haven't been

00:07:41.795 --> 00:07:43.400 align:middle line:90%
studying this the whole time.

00:07:43.400 --> 00:07:46.530 align:middle line:84%
Wondering where are we--
what's happening here?

00:07:46.530 --> 00:07:48.150 align:middle line:10%
What's happening in our dreams?

00:07:48.150 --> 00:07:51.110 align:middle line:10%
Scientists believe, one
of the leading theories,

00:07:51.110 --> 00:07:55.380 align:middle line:10%
is that your brain is
optimizing through the night.

00:07:55.380 --> 00:07:58.530 align:middle line:10%
It's taking everything that
you saw during the day.

00:07:58.530 --> 00:08:01.610 align:middle line:10%
It's optimizing and
triaging the memories

00:08:01.610 --> 00:08:03.710 align:middle line:10%
that you're going to
keep, and that you're

00:08:03.710 --> 00:08:07.930 align:middle line:10%
witnessing that optimization.

00:08:07.930 --> 00:08:09.890 align:middle line:90%
That's possible.

00:08:09.890 --> 00:08:13.940 align:middle line:84%
I ask myself, what would be the
evolutionary advantage of that?

00:08:13.940 --> 00:08:15.320 align:middle line:90%
I don't know.

00:08:15.320 --> 00:08:18.610 align:middle line:10%
It just seems underwhelming.

00:08:18.610 --> 00:08:20.480 align:middle line:10%
I just don't think
that that's the answer.

00:08:20.480 --> 00:08:23.770 align:middle line:10%
And other people believe that
it's a mishmash of the day,

00:08:23.770 --> 00:08:24.890 align:middle line:10%
and that's fine.

00:08:24.890 --> 00:08:28.580 align:middle line:10%
I can recognize that in some
dreams, and sometimes it's that.

00:08:28.580 --> 00:08:34.340 align:middle line:10%
But is that a holistic,
all-encompassing explanation?

00:08:34.340 --> 00:08:37.159 align:middle line:10%
I think we would
all say no to that.

00:08:37.159 --> 00:08:40.570 align:middle line:10%
So there are many
mysteries about us

00:08:40.570 --> 00:08:44.250 align:middle line:10%
and we have barely
scratched the surface.

00:08:44.250 --> 00:08:47.340 align:middle line:84%
And then, abduction and
close encounter research.

00:08:47.340 --> 00:08:50.590 align:middle line:84%
I've been deep into this
for the last few years.

00:08:50.590 --> 00:08:52.950 align:middle line:10%
And there's one thing I
want to say about this.

00:08:52.950 --> 00:08:56.060 align:middle line:10%
We can argue whether they're
malevolent or benevolent.

00:08:56.060 --> 00:09:01.110 align:middle line:10%
I personally subscribe to
the many groups, many agendas

00:09:01.110 --> 00:09:02.830 align:middle line:10%
that makes more sense to me.

00:09:02.830 --> 00:09:06.390 align:middle line:10%
But there's one thing when you
go through the research that

00:09:06.390 --> 00:09:09.270 align:middle line:10%
really stands out that
you can say is for sure,

00:09:09.270 --> 00:09:14.700 align:middle line:10%
and that is there is cognitive
manipulation going on.

00:09:14.700 --> 00:09:18.330 align:middle line:10%
So this is it.

00:09:18.330 --> 00:09:22.820 align:middle line:10%
They are interfacing
with the mind, our minds,

00:09:22.820 --> 00:09:27.710 align:middle line:10%
in a more advanced
way than we are.

00:09:27.710 --> 00:09:32.180 align:middle line:84%
They are interfacing with our
minds in a more advanced way

00:09:32.180 --> 00:09:33.620 align:middle line:90%
than we are.

00:09:33.620 --> 00:09:36.140 align:middle line:10%
This is another
reason why I think

00:09:36.140 --> 00:09:41.530 align:middle line:10%
that we need to have a deeper
look at what we are capable of.

00:09:41.530 --> 00:09:43.040 align:middle line:84%
So in this lecture,
I'm not going

00:09:43.040 --> 00:09:47.930 align:middle line:84%
to exactly address things,
discount them or address guides,

00:09:47.930 --> 00:09:49.940 align:middle line:90%
guardians, people's beliefs.

00:09:49.940 --> 00:09:52.250 align:middle line:10%
I'm bringing this back to us--

00:09:52.250 --> 00:09:54.890 align:middle line:10%
our subconscious
mind, the mysteries

00:09:54.890 --> 00:09:59.620 align:middle line:10%
of us, our consciousness,
what we are capable of.

00:09:59.620 --> 00:10:01.330 align:middle line:90%
We are the greatest mystery.

00:10:01.330 --> 00:10:03.260 align:middle line:90%
We are more than these bodies.

00:10:03.260 --> 00:10:05.740 align:middle line:84%
If you've ever had an
out-of-body experience

00:10:05.740 --> 00:10:08.320 align:middle line:84%
or a near-death
experience, I mean,

00:10:08.320 --> 00:10:09.980 align:middle line:90%
you know what that feels like.

00:10:09.980 --> 00:10:13.240 align:middle line:84%
And it's pretty hard to convince
you that we're just this body.

00:10:13.240 --> 00:10:15.380 align:middle line:90%
Science might not agree.

00:10:15.380 --> 00:10:17.800 align:middle line:84%
They believe partially--
some of them do.

00:10:17.800 --> 00:10:20.350 align:middle line:84%
That it's phantom limb,
which is an amputee

00:10:20.350 --> 00:10:22.480 align:middle line:84%
gets their arm
amputated and they still

00:10:22.480 --> 00:10:25.870 align:middle line:84%
have a pain sensation
in part of their limb.

00:10:25.870 --> 00:10:29.440 align:middle line:84%
But there's actually-- which
would be ultimately a projection

00:10:29.440 --> 00:10:30.370 align:middle line:90%
of the mind.

00:10:30.370 --> 00:10:32.270 align:middle line:84%
But there's a
counterargument to that.

00:10:32.270 --> 00:10:35.890 align:middle line:10%
I have several friends
who are remote viewers,

00:10:35.890 --> 00:10:39.370 align:middle line:10%
and they're very proficient
at going out of body.

00:10:39.370 --> 00:10:42.760 align:middle line:10%
Without a body you
lose your sense of you

00:10:42.760 --> 00:10:45.380 align:middle line:10%
and you go to another location.

00:10:45.380 --> 00:10:47.770 align:middle line:10%
And in this example,
they're able to retrieve

00:10:47.770 --> 00:10:51.410 align:middle line:10%
actionable information for the
authorities and bring it back.

00:10:51.410 --> 00:10:56.840 align:middle line:10%
So in those cases, I mean,
it cannot be a projection

00:10:56.840 --> 00:10:58.050 align:middle line:10%
of the mind.

00:10:58.050 --> 00:11:02.640 align:middle line:84%
And so I believe sometimes it
could be, but not all the time.

00:11:02.640 --> 00:11:05.780 align:middle line:84%
Again, so we're not getting
these holistic, all-encompassing

00:11:05.780 --> 00:11:07.050 align:middle line:90%
explanations.

00:11:07.050 --> 00:11:11.430 align:middle line:84%
So, I mean, the mysteries
of us are beautiful.

00:11:11.430 --> 00:11:15.060 align:middle line:84%
But I just think with the advent
of AI, it's time to explore it.

00:11:15.060 --> 00:11:17.100 align:middle line:90%
We are beyond space and time.

00:11:17.100 --> 00:11:19.910 align:middle line:10%
Remote viewing is one of--
controlled remote viewing,

00:11:19.910 --> 00:11:23.630 align:middle line:10%
in particular in the
lab, is one of the best

00:11:23.630 --> 00:11:27.780 align:middle line:10%
areas of proof for this, and
beyond time, precognition.

00:11:27.780 --> 00:11:30.780 align:middle line:10%
So there's remote viewing, it's
called future remote viewing.

00:11:30.780 --> 00:11:33.620 align:middle line:10%
So you're going outside
of time to get answers.

00:11:33.620 --> 00:11:36.510 align:middle line:10%
We have our own
built-in holodecks.

00:11:36.510 --> 00:11:39.560 align:middle line:10%
Now, obviously, this is "Star
Trek" I'm talking about,

00:11:39.560 --> 00:11:42.140 align:middle line:10%
not everybody might
know what that is.

00:11:42.140 --> 00:11:43.970 align:middle line:84%
I have a picture
on the next screen,

00:11:43.970 --> 00:11:46.710 align:middle line:84%
but holodecks is a
simulated reality.

00:11:46.710 --> 00:11:48.950 align:middle line:10%
They're flying around
in space on their ship,

00:11:48.950 --> 00:11:51.480 align:middle line:10%
and they have a room
they can walk into.

00:11:51.480 --> 00:11:55.420 align:middle line:10%
And when they do, it looks like
a grid, something like this.

00:11:55.420 --> 00:11:57.010 align:middle line:84%
They don't have a
program running.

00:11:57.010 --> 00:11:58.710 align:middle line:84%
And then this is
how it is once they

00:11:58.710 --> 00:12:01.440 align:middle line:84%
run the program in the
lower corner there,

00:12:01.440 --> 00:12:04.780 align:middle line:84%
it becomes this virtual,
all-encompassing reality

00:12:04.780 --> 00:12:07.770 align:middle line:84%
they can walk into,
interact anytime,

00:12:07.770 --> 00:12:11.830 align:middle line:84%
anywhere, different characters,
different level of awareness.

00:12:11.830 --> 00:12:16.080 align:middle line:10%
And I truly believe, after
all the experimentation

00:12:16.080 --> 00:12:19.320 align:middle line:10%
I've done on myself, that
we have a holodeck in here

00:12:19.320 --> 00:12:21.780 align:middle line:10%
that is virtually unexplored.

00:12:21.780 --> 00:12:22.990 align:middle line:10%
So back to this.

00:12:22.990 --> 00:12:24.900 align:middle line:10%
My lecture series
is called the Final

00:12:24.900 --> 00:12:29.230 align:middle line:10%
Frontier Is In Here, because you
can't convince me that it's not.

00:12:29.230 --> 00:12:32.850 align:middle line:84%
The space is an
amazing frontier.

00:12:32.850 --> 00:12:37.260 align:middle line:10%
If you've got a ton of
money, people, maybe we'll

00:12:37.260 --> 00:12:43.020 align:middle line:10%
get to do that sometime,
but we also can go inside.

00:12:43.020 --> 00:12:46.950 align:middle line:10%
Inward, we have the same
key-- again, the best evidence

00:12:46.950 --> 00:12:49.200 align:middle line:10%
is from remote viewing,
out-of-body, near-death.

00:12:49.200 --> 00:12:53.380 align:middle line:10%
The same key to go and access
all of the same things.

00:12:53.380 --> 00:12:57.450 align:middle line:10%
So for me-- and I'm
sure most of you,

00:12:57.450 --> 00:13:01.060 align:middle line:10%
you know the final frontier
is actually within us.

00:13:01.060 --> 00:13:04.110 align:middle line:10%
You can tell I'm a
little passionate.

00:13:04.110 --> 00:13:08.910 align:middle line:84%
So perhaps science and AI
will understand some of this,

00:13:08.910 --> 00:13:10.530 align:middle line:84%
and perhaps it
will crack the code

00:13:10.530 --> 00:13:12.820 align:middle line:84%
of some of this limitless
potential of us.

00:13:12.820 --> 00:13:14.430 align:middle line:90%
I'm sure it will.

00:13:14.430 --> 00:13:17.500 align:middle line:10%
But will it ever be able to
have an out-of-body experience?

00:13:17.500 --> 00:13:20.290 align:middle line:10%
Will it ever be able to
penetrate another reality?

00:13:20.290 --> 00:13:21.670 align:middle line:10%
I don't really know about that.

00:13:21.670 --> 00:13:24.180 align:middle line:84%
What I think would
happen would be

00:13:24.180 --> 00:13:28.110 align:middle line:84%
that it would amalgamate so much
information that we wouldn't

00:13:28.110 --> 00:13:29.440 align:middle line:90%
be able to tell the difference.

00:13:29.440 --> 00:13:31.920 align:middle line:84%
It would convince us just
by all of the knowledge

00:13:31.920 --> 00:13:33.610 align:middle line:90%
that it gathers from all of us.

00:13:33.610 --> 00:13:37.920 align:middle line:84%
And if I were an advanced
civilization looking down at us,

00:13:37.920 --> 00:13:40.320 align:middle line:84%
I think I would be really
interested in this time

00:13:40.320 --> 00:13:42.550 align:middle line:84%
to see what we're going
to do with our technology.

00:13:42.550 --> 00:13:43.860 align:middle line:90%
I'm sure they already know.

00:13:43.860 --> 00:13:48.570 align:middle line:10%
But I would also be
very interested to know

00:13:48.570 --> 00:13:51.070 align:middle line:10%
what we're going to do.

00:13:51.070 --> 00:13:54.270 align:middle line:10%
Are we going to give
it all up, or are we

00:13:54.270 --> 00:13:57.100 align:middle line:10%
going to continue to
evolve these minds?

00:13:57.100 --> 00:14:01.410 align:middle line:10%
And are we going to figure
out what this supercomputer is

00:14:01.410 --> 00:14:04.440 align:middle line:10%
and how much more
we can do with it?

00:14:04.440 --> 00:14:06.810 align:middle line:10%
Yeah, a little
passionate, sorry.

00:14:06.810 --> 00:14:09.370 align:middle line:90%
So [LAUGHS] it's true.

00:14:09.370 --> 00:14:11.220 align:middle line:90%
We are amazing.

00:14:11.220 --> 00:14:12.900 align:middle line:10%
So just in case--

00:14:12.900 --> 00:14:16.020 align:middle line:10%
I mean, I first talked
about most of this lecture

00:14:16.020 --> 00:14:16.823 align:middle line:10%
earlier this year.

00:14:16.823 --> 00:14:18.240 align:middle line:10%
And I realized not
a lot of people

00:14:18.240 --> 00:14:19.920 align:middle line:10%
knew what quantum
computers were.

00:14:19.920 --> 00:14:22.410 align:middle line:10%
Wow, look at how much that's
changed in a couple of months.

00:14:22.410 --> 00:14:23.930 align:middle line:10%
People didn't know
what ChatGPT was.

00:14:23.930 --> 00:14:24.730 align:middle line:10%
Look at that.

00:14:24.730 --> 00:14:25.890 align:middle line:10%
Everybody knows now.

00:14:25.890 --> 00:14:28.050 align:middle line:10%
But just in case,
so I'm just going

00:14:28.050 --> 00:14:29.590 align:middle line:10%
to give this quick analogy.

00:14:29.590 --> 00:14:35.850 align:middle line:84%
So on this side, it's basically
like linear computation.

00:14:35.850 --> 00:14:38.800 align:middle line:84%
You're entering in variables
one at a time here.

00:14:38.800 --> 00:14:41.680 align:middle line:84%
And then this is my
quantum computer.

00:14:41.680 --> 00:14:46.060 align:middle line:84%
It's omnidirectional,
exponential computing.

00:14:46.060 --> 00:14:48.720 align:middle line:84%
And just to put it, boil
it down to a nutshell,

00:14:48.720 --> 00:14:50.370 align:middle line:90%
it's really about speed.

00:14:50.370 --> 00:14:53.460 align:middle line:84%
So I ask the computer,
give me a good analogy.

00:14:53.460 --> 00:14:55.780 align:middle line:10%
And this is what I got
back, which is perfect.

00:14:55.780 --> 00:14:58.680 align:middle line:10%
It says, computation
wise, in terms of time

00:14:58.680 --> 00:15:02.130 align:middle line:10%
it takes to solve complex
problems an analogy might be,

00:15:02.130 --> 00:15:05.350 align:middle line:10%
the difference between a normal
computer and a quantum computer

00:15:05.350 --> 00:15:08.690 align:middle line:10%
is like the difference between
walking and teleporting.

00:15:08.690 --> 00:15:13.930 align:middle line:84%
So if anybody doesn't know,
it's the giant wild card

00:15:13.930 --> 00:15:16.030 align:middle line:90%
that we're about to meet.

00:15:16.030 --> 00:15:17.680 align:middle line:10%
What is it going to
be like when it can

00:15:17.680 --> 00:15:20.470 align:middle line:10%
calculate so far beyond humans.

00:15:20.470 --> 00:15:22.370 align:middle line:10%
That's the question.

00:15:22.370 --> 00:15:27.640 align:middle line:10%
So when you look at this, too,
if you were anything like me

00:15:27.640 --> 00:15:29.500 align:middle line:10%
or if this has touched
your life in any way,

00:15:29.500 --> 00:15:31.150 align:middle line:10%
with your kids, or anybody else.

00:15:31.150 --> 00:15:34.270 align:middle line:10%
For me, I slammed into this
wall of left brain, right brain

00:15:34.270 --> 00:15:36.850 align:middle line:10%
when I was younger just
because I was in school

00:15:36.850 --> 00:15:38.660 align:middle line:10%
and I didn't learn
like other kids,

00:15:38.660 --> 00:15:41.260 align:middle line:10%
and I didn't know what was
going on for a long time.

00:15:41.260 --> 00:15:43.220 align:middle line:90%
So a lot of tears.

00:15:43.220 --> 00:15:47.020 align:middle line:84%
And because I
would observe kids,

00:15:47.020 --> 00:15:49.357 align:middle line:84%
and they would just
intake text and they

00:15:49.357 --> 00:15:51.190 align:middle line:84%
would be able to have
reading comprehension,

00:15:51.190 --> 00:15:52.520 align:middle line:90%
just super smooth.

00:15:52.520 --> 00:15:56.140 align:middle line:84%
And so for me-- and I'm sure
many of you might identify with

00:15:56.140 --> 00:15:57.610 align:middle line:90%
this--

00:15:57.610 --> 00:15:59.410 align:middle line:90%
my brain felt very abstract.

00:15:59.410 --> 00:16:02.453 align:middle line:84%
And it was just you would
come up with ideas and things

00:16:02.453 --> 00:16:04.120 align:middle line:84%
that you thought were
OK, but you always

00:16:04.120 --> 00:16:05.530 align:middle line:90%
felt like you didn't fit.

00:16:05.530 --> 00:16:10.090 align:middle line:84%
Because the world really, it
valued left brain strength more.

00:16:10.090 --> 00:16:11.110 align:middle line:10%
It just did.

00:16:11.110 --> 00:16:12.280 align:middle line:10%
It's understandable.

00:16:12.280 --> 00:16:14.980 align:middle line:10%
Because when they did the
split brain research studies

00:16:14.980 --> 00:16:17.230 align:middle line:10%
and they snipped
the corpus callosum

00:16:17.230 --> 00:16:19.420 align:middle line:10%
and they could study
them individually,

00:16:19.420 --> 00:16:21.550 align:middle line:10%
they learned that
really the left brain

00:16:21.550 --> 00:16:23.240 align:middle line:10%
was in charge of language.

00:16:23.240 --> 00:16:25.550 align:middle line:10%
And so that's what
made it so important.

00:16:25.550 --> 00:16:27.490 align:middle line:10%
And the right brain was
more visual, spatial,

00:16:27.490 --> 00:16:30.910 align:middle line:10%
and it could do pictures,
but it couldn't speak.

00:16:30.910 --> 00:16:34.130 align:middle line:10%
So it was on the back burner.

00:16:34.130 --> 00:16:36.550 align:middle line:10%
And so if you were in school,
and you had your-- just,

00:16:36.550 --> 00:16:40.010 align:middle line:10%
I mean, obviously, we use
all of our brain, obviously.

00:16:40.010 --> 00:16:45.280 align:middle line:84%
But it's just but there
is still something, too,

00:16:45.280 --> 00:16:48.340 align:middle line:84%
right-lateralized thinking
and processing, which

00:16:48.340 --> 00:16:49.850 align:middle line:90%
is more visual spatial.

00:16:49.850 --> 00:16:52.420 align:middle line:10%
I think that just
sometimes the left for us,

00:16:52.420 --> 00:16:56.320 align:middle line:10%
it just for some people
it governs more strongly.

00:16:56.320 --> 00:16:58.910 align:middle line:10%
And sometimes it
governs less strong.

00:16:58.910 --> 00:17:01.150 align:middle line:10%
And so the right brain
is just a little more--

00:17:01.150 --> 00:17:05.260 align:middle line:10%
it processes a little
more dominantly.

00:17:05.260 --> 00:17:09.369 align:middle line:10%
But I couldn't help when
I saw this to just mention

00:17:09.369 --> 00:17:12.910 align:middle line:10%
that because it comes into
play in remote viewing.

00:17:12.910 --> 00:17:16.089 align:middle line:10%
It comes into play in so
many areas of our lives

00:17:16.089 --> 00:17:19.180 align:middle line:10%
that even though
psychology rejects it,

00:17:19.180 --> 00:17:23.950 align:middle line:10%
I reject that it rejects it
because it's a language that we

00:17:23.950 --> 00:17:29.350 align:middle line:10%
can use to describe some things
that are important to us.

00:17:29.350 --> 00:17:32.420 align:middle line:84%
When we're struggling and our
brain doesn't work the same,

00:17:32.420 --> 00:17:36.500 align:middle line:84%
we need a language, and this
helps with the language.

00:17:36.500 --> 00:17:40.060 align:middle line:84%
And remote viewing
is a perfect example

00:17:40.060 --> 00:17:44.890 align:middle line:84%
of a laboratory setting
where they looked at this.

00:17:44.890 --> 00:17:49.450 align:middle line:84%
They wondered, is this
a right brain function?

00:17:49.450 --> 00:17:51.130 align:middle line:84%
The remote viewing
program was started

00:17:51.130 --> 00:17:55.550 align:middle line:84%
by Hal Puthoff and Russell Targ
at Stanford Research Institute.

00:17:55.550 --> 00:17:58.000 align:middle line:10%
But a little known
fact is that when

00:17:58.000 --> 00:18:00.580 align:middle line:10%
they were doing their early
tests, their early studies,

00:18:00.580 --> 00:18:03.850 align:middle line:10%
their early remote views, and
they were looking at them,

00:18:03.850 --> 00:18:07.510 align:middle line:10%
it was Hal Puthoff's
wife, Adrian,

00:18:07.510 --> 00:18:12.640 align:middle line:10%
who's a gestalt therapist, who
recognized that, wow, they're

00:18:12.640 --> 00:18:15.520 align:middle line:10%
getting it wrong in
the text, but they're

00:18:15.520 --> 00:18:18.050 align:middle line:10%
getting it right in the images.

00:18:18.050 --> 00:18:21.350 align:middle line:84%
So they're wondering, could
this be a right brain function.

00:18:21.350 --> 00:18:24.580 align:middle line:10%
So all of the protocols
that I'm about to talk about

00:18:24.580 --> 00:18:29.350 align:middle line:10%
were all worked out to deal with
the left and the right brain

00:18:29.350 --> 00:18:31.330 align:middle line:10%
and their specialties.

00:18:31.330 --> 00:18:32.750 align:middle line:10%
We have to use it all.

00:18:32.750 --> 00:18:34.280 align:middle line:10%
It's important that
we have it all.

00:18:34.280 --> 00:18:35.720 align:middle line:90%
It's there for a reason.

00:18:35.720 --> 00:18:37.900 align:middle line:84%
But how do you
nuance it when you

00:18:37.900 --> 00:18:42.490 align:middle line:84%
need to come up with a
result, like a repeatable ESP

00:18:42.490 --> 00:18:43.930 align:middle line:90%
experiment.

00:18:43.930 --> 00:18:47.680 align:middle line:10%
OK, so let's get into it right
now, controlled remote viewing.

00:18:47.680 --> 00:18:50.470 align:middle line:10%
So I want to explain some
differences because I

00:18:50.470 --> 00:18:52.210 align:middle line:10%
know a lot of people get this.

00:18:52.210 --> 00:18:53.920 align:middle line:10%
You get information
off the internet,

00:18:53.920 --> 00:18:55.430 align:middle line:10%
and it gets a little confusing.

00:18:55.430 --> 00:19:00.110 align:middle line:10%
So remote viewing sometimes
gets used in the psychic world.

00:19:00.110 --> 00:19:04.540 align:middle line:10%
And I'm not dishing on this
because I love that word.

00:19:04.540 --> 00:19:07.640 align:middle line:10%
But I'm just going to use it
to explain the differences.

00:19:07.640 --> 00:19:09.370 align:middle line:10%
So sometimes remote
viewing will be

00:19:09.370 --> 00:19:11.180 align:middle line:10%
used as the term
for psychic ability.

00:19:11.180 --> 00:19:12.520 align:middle line:10%
And it is.

00:19:12.520 --> 00:19:13.690 align:middle line:10%
It is.

00:19:13.690 --> 00:19:18.222 align:middle line:84%
But controlled remote
viewing, sometimes called CRV,

00:19:18.222 --> 00:19:20.680 align:middle line:84%
or you might have heard it
called coordinate remote viewing

00:19:20.680 --> 00:19:23.170 align:middle line:84%
in the past, which is
what it was called,

00:19:23.170 --> 00:19:25.990 align:middle line:84%
is really-- we're talking
about remote viewing that

00:19:25.990 --> 00:19:27.930 align:middle line:90%
was done in a lab.

00:19:27.930 --> 00:19:29.960 align:middle line:90%
So that's the difference.

00:19:29.960 --> 00:19:34.960 align:middle line:10%
It's like a psychic will
use their intuition.

00:19:34.960 --> 00:19:38.010 align:middle line:10%
A controlled remote viewer
will use their intuition

00:19:38.010 --> 00:19:40.670 align:middle line:10%
with a set of
instructions over top.

00:19:40.670 --> 00:19:43.470 align:middle line:10%
So you're basically
going through a process

00:19:43.470 --> 00:19:45.990 align:middle line:10%
of probing your
mind with questions

00:19:45.990 --> 00:19:47.030 align:middle line:10%
that are predetermined.

00:19:47.030 --> 00:19:48.690 align:middle line:10%
That's how we're
taught to do it.

00:19:48.690 --> 00:19:52.140 align:middle line:84%
It's like your left brain is
interviewing your right brain

00:19:52.140 --> 00:19:55.780 align:middle line:84%
or your conscious mind is
interviewing your subconscious

00:19:55.780 --> 00:19:56.580 align:middle line:90%
mind.

00:19:56.580 --> 00:19:58.780 align:middle line:10%
So there's a bit
of an art to that.

00:19:58.780 --> 00:20:00.340 align:middle line:10%
And they've accounted for this.

00:20:00.340 --> 00:20:02.760 align:middle line:10%
And the reason is
your left brain

00:20:02.760 --> 00:20:06.000 align:middle line:10%
is more designed
for your every day,

00:20:06.000 --> 00:20:09.040 align:middle line:10%
and your right brain is
a little bit different.

00:20:09.040 --> 00:20:13.230 align:middle line:84%
So we have to settle the
left down because it's

00:20:13.230 --> 00:20:14.520 align:middle line:90%
designed for survival.

00:20:14.520 --> 00:20:16.350 align:middle line:90%
When you're trying to have--

00:20:16.350 --> 00:20:19.920 align:middle line:84%
when you're trying to bring an
extra sensory perceptive images,

00:20:19.920 --> 00:20:23.802 align:middle line:84%
your left brain, your
ego, wants to help you,

00:20:23.802 --> 00:20:26.260 align:middle line:84%
and it wants to guess, and it
wants to give you the answer.

00:20:26.260 --> 00:20:27.288 align:middle line:10%
And it wants to--

00:20:27.288 --> 00:20:28.830 align:middle line:10%
it's like, I think
I know what it is.

00:20:28.830 --> 00:20:31.090 align:middle line:10%
This is why we
generally don't want

00:20:31.090 --> 00:20:33.250 align:middle line:10%
to know anything
about the target we're

00:20:33.250 --> 00:20:36.160 align:middle line:10%
trying to figure out.

00:20:36.160 --> 00:20:38.140 align:middle line:10%
So we have to calm
the left brain down

00:20:38.140 --> 00:20:41.030 align:middle line:10%
and the protocols
appease it in a way.

00:20:41.030 --> 00:20:44.270 align:middle line:10%
It's got a job so that the
right brain can do its work.

00:20:44.270 --> 00:20:46.820 align:middle line:10%
It's really brilliant
how these guys did this.

00:20:46.820 --> 00:20:54.040 align:middle line:10%
So remote viewing is a process
of gathering psychic impressions

00:20:54.040 --> 00:20:57.050 align:middle line:10%
about a target that
is hidden from you.

00:20:57.050 --> 00:20:58.180 align:middle line:10%
That's it.

00:20:58.180 --> 00:20:59.650 align:middle line:10%
you don't know
what the target is,

00:20:59.650 --> 00:21:02.620 align:middle line:10%
and you're just slowly
bringing in these fragments,

00:21:02.620 --> 00:21:04.600 align:middle line:10%
and you're trying to
bring them into deeper

00:21:04.600 --> 00:21:09.610 align:middle line:10%
clarity via these questions
that are predetermined.

00:21:09.610 --> 00:21:11.900 align:middle line:10%
So a couple of things
I just want to say.

00:21:11.900 --> 00:21:14.020 align:middle line:10%
There's four main
things that are

00:21:14.020 --> 00:21:17.320 align:middle line:10%
different between the
psychic and the controlled

00:21:17.320 --> 00:21:18.260 align:middle line:10%
remote viewing.

00:21:18.260 --> 00:21:20.650 align:middle line:10%
So you're using
specific protocols,

00:21:20.650 --> 00:21:22.870 align:middle line:10%
which we just talked about,
designed to filter out

00:21:22.870 --> 00:21:25.090 align:middle line:10%
the ego so that you can
get the signal line,

00:21:25.090 --> 00:21:26.920 align:middle line:10%
the psychic impression.

00:21:26.920 --> 00:21:29.100 align:middle line:84%
You practice on
verifiable targets

00:21:29.100 --> 00:21:31.060 align:middle line:90%
to get a bit of a track record.

00:21:31.060 --> 00:21:33.090 align:middle line:90%
So you want to have--

00:21:33.090 --> 00:21:35.010 align:middle line:84%
so often, they're
put in an envelope,

00:21:35.010 --> 00:21:36.310 align:middle line:90%
they're hidden from you.

00:21:36.310 --> 00:21:38.580 align:middle line:84%
You try to go in and
determine what it is.

00:21:38.580 --> 00:21:41.160 align:middle line:10%
But it's really important
that at the end,

00:21:41.160 --> 00:21:43.710 align:middle line:10%
while you're learning, which
can be for a long time,

00:21:43.710 --> 00:21:46.840 align:middle line:10%
that you're able to look
at them side by side

00:21:46.840 --> 00:21:49.583 align:middle line:10%
and look at all of
the different things

00:21:49.583 --> 00:21:52.000 align:middle line:10%
that you might have got right
or you might have got wrong.

00:21:52.000 --> 00:21:54.880 align:middle line:10%
Because sometimes people
are-- well, all the time,

00:21:54.880 --> 00:21:57.040 align:middle line:10%
actually, we have
different specialties.

00:21:57.040 --> 00:21:59.460 align:middle line:10%
Some of us might be good
at perceiving people.

00:21:59.460 --> 00:22:02.760 align:middle line:10%
Some of us might be good
at perceiving repeating

00:22:02.760 --> 00:22:05.290 align:middle line:10%
patterns or colors or shapes.

00:22:05.290 --> 00:22:06.700 align:middle line:10%
Everybody's different.

00:22:06.700 --> 00:22:10.200 align:middle line:10%
So when they would do this for
intelligence really seriously,

00:22:10.200 --> 00:22:12.060 align:middle line:10%
it was always best
to work with a team

00:22:12.060 --> 00:22:15.600 align:middle line:10%
where they knew the track
record of people's strengths

00:22:15.600 --> 00:22:17.170 align:middle line:10%
and people's weaknesses.

00:22:17.170 --> 00:22:19.420 align:middle line:10%
This is the best way to do this.

00:22:19.420 --> 00:22:22.800 align:middle line:10%
So verifiable targets
is no small thing

00:22:22.800 --> 00:22:24.670 align:middle line:10%
in the controlled
remote viewing world.

00:22:24.670 --> 00:22:26.340 align:middle line:10%
You want to build.

00:22:26.340 --> 00:22:28.350 align:middle line:10%
You want to see your
strengths, and you

00:22:28.350 --> 00:22:31.340 align:middle line:10%
want to see what you're not so
great at, so you can work on it.

00:22:31.340 --> 00:22:33.880 align:middle line:10%
But this is also
where I began to see

00:22:33.880 --> 00:22:36.285 align:middle line:10%
what I was interested
in about remote viewing.

00:22:36.285 --> 00:22:37.660 align:middle line:10%
It wasn't really
about the target

00:22:37.660 --> 00:22:41.870 align:middle line:10%
because the target is always
somebody else's agenda,

00:22:41.870 --> 00:22:44.440 align:middle line:10%
But when you're
looking at these,

00:22:44.440 --> 00:22:50.210 align:middle line:10%
you are seeing how your
brain is communicating.

00:22:50.210 --> 00:22:54.580 align:middle line:84%
And to me, that is
absolutely an invaluable tool

00:22:54.580 --> 00:22:56.300 align:middle line:90%
to look at ourselves.

00:22:56.300 --> 00:22:58.840 align:middle line:84%
So this, for me, is what
remote viewing is about,

00:22:58.840 --> 00:23:01.810 align:middle line:84%
learning the subconscious
language that's

00:23:01.810 --> 00:23:03.290 align:middle line:90%
going on inside us.

00:23:03.290 --> 00:23:07.000 align:middle line:84%
It will take us to deeper
steps of understanding

00:23:07.000 --> 00:23:09.530 align:middle line:90%
how your own brain works.

00:23:09.530 --> 00:23:11.560 align:middle line:10%
So remote viewing
is one of the ways.

00:23:11.560 --> 00:23:15.160 align:middle line:10%
Another thing that's
different, a psychic might say,

00:23:15.160 --> 00:23:16.670 align:middle line:10%
I see an apple.

00:23:16.670 --> 00:23:22.460 align:middle line:10%
A controlled remote viewer would
say, I see a spherical object.

00:23:22.460 --> 00:23:24.320 align:middle line:10%
It's red in color.

00:23:24.320 --> 00:23:29.210 align:middle line:10%
It smells, feels like it's
natural as opposed to man-made.

00:23:29.210 --> 00:23:33.010 align:middle line:84%
So they're describing
they're not naming.

00:23:33.010 --> 00:23:36.470 align:middle line:84%
Another thing, we are
completely blind to the target.

00:23:36.470 --> 00:23:39.380 align:middle line:84%
So that just means we know
nothing about the target.

00:23:39.380 --> 00:23:41.890 align:middle line:10%
It's actually far
easier to do that,

00:23:41.890 --> 00:23:45.075 align:middle line:10%
oddly, because if you
have a deck of 52 cards,

00:23:45.075 --> 00:23:46.450 align:middle line:10%
this is what I
was saying before,

00:23:46.450 --> 00:23:49.060 align:middle line:10%
the left brain gets to
get involved and say,

00:23:49.060 --> 00:23:51.410 align:middle line:10%
I know the answer, and
it will guess right.

00:23:51.410 --> 00:23:54.190 align:middle line:10%
But if there's infinite
targets, the left brain

00:23:54.190 --> 00:23:55.930 align:middle line:10%
doesn't know what
to do with that,

00:23:55.930 --> 00:23:58.670 align:middle line:10%
and it's easier to calm it down.

00:23:58.670 --> 00:24:00.460 align:middle line:10%
It's like, I got this.

00:24:00.460 --> 00:24:03.500 align:middle line:10%
And you just go for it.

00:24:03.500 --> 00:24:05.250 align:middle line:84%
The other thing that's
really interesting,

00:24:05.250 --> 00:24:07.330 align:middle line:90%
you don't chase a target.

00:24:07.330 --> 00:24:09.580 align:middle line:10%
You have to allow it.

00:24:09.580 --> 00:24:12.190 align:middle line:10%
It's one of the tricky things.

00:24:12.190 --> 00:24:15.370 align:middle line:10%
But it's a wonderful thing that
you don't have to chase it.

00:24:15.370 --> 00:24:17.700 align:middle line:10%
You wait for it.

00:24:17.700 --> 00:24:20.710 align:middle line:10%
So it has many
levels of engagement.

00:24:20.710 --> 00:24:23.190 align:middle line:10%
And in the past, I've talked
about many of my remote views,

00:24:23.190 --> 00:24:24.900 align:middle line:10%
but I'm only going
to talk about one,

00:24:24.900 --> 00:24:27.350 align:middle line:10%
the one that changed my life.

00:24:27.350 --> 00:24:29.810 align:middle line:10%
But before I do that,
I'm going to give you

00:24:29.810 --> 00:24:36.110 align:middle line:10%
a nice little treat with Russell
Targ, one of the grandfathers

00:24:36.110 --> 00:24:37.920 align:middle line:10%
of the remote viewing program.

00:24:37.920 --> 00:24:39.440 align:middle line:10%
This is with
permission from Russell

00:24:39.440 --> 00:24:41.520 align:middle line:10%
and Lance Mungia who
created this movie.

00:24:41.520 --> 00:24:43.800 align:middle line:10%
If you haven't seen
it, "Third Eye Spies,"

00:24:43.800 --> 00:24:45.275 align:middle line:10%
I highly recommend it.

00:24:45.275 --> 00:24:46.075 align:middle line:90%
Let's watch.

- Let this information out.

00:24:49.840 --> 00:24:53.920 align:middle line:84%
- The experiments have been in
the field of remote viewing.

00:24:53.920 --> 00:24:59.200 align:middle line:84%
We got into it when we
discovered that they were in it.

00:24:59.200 --> 00:25:03.040 align:middle line:10%
- I realized that what people
can do is quiet their mind

00:25:03.040 --> 00:25:07.095 align:middle line:10%
and describe the experiences
that appear in your awareness.

00:25:07.095 --> 00:25:08.770 align:middle line:84%
We've been investigating
a phenomenon

00:25:08.770 --> 00:25:10.660 align:middle line:90%
called remote viewing.

00:25:10.660 --> 00:25:14.980 align:middle line:10%
We found that many individuals
are able to accurately describe

00:25:14.980 --> 00:25:18.250 align:middle line:10%
what's going on in
distant locations, locked

00:25:18.250 --> 00:25:21.490 align:middle line:10%
from any kind of
ordinary perception.

00:25:21.490 --> 00:25:22.310 align:middle line:10%
Don't name it.

00:25:22.310 --> 00:25:26.420 align:middle line:84%
Just tell me what appears
in your visual field,

00:25:26.420 --> 00:25:27.630 align:middle line:90%
and then draw that.

00:25:27.630 --> 00:25:32.390 align:middle line:90%


00:25:32.390 --> 00:25:36.110 align:middle line:84%
- Are you saying that the work
you've been doing is classified?

00:25:36.110 --> 00:25:40.370 align:middle line:84%
- I really can't talk about
matters of classification,

00:25:40.370 --> 00:25:42.170 align:middle line:90%
as you can imagine.

00:25:42.170 --> 00:25:44.736 align:middle line:84%
My name is Russell Targ,
and I'm a physicist.

00:25:44.736 --> 00:25:59.700 align:middle line:90%

>> "The fate of the world
was taught inside the mind."

00:26:05.000 --> 00:26:06.740 align:middle line:10%
That was pretty powerful
statement there.

00:26:06.740 --> 00:26:10.160 align:middle line:10%
If anyone's interested in any
more information, Lance Mungia's

00:26:10.160 --> 00:26:15.450 align:middle line:10%
YouTube channel, the creator
of this is Waking Universe.

00:26:15.450 --> 00:26:19.350 align:middle line:10%
And these were just some
of his extra footage here,

00:26:19.350 --> 00:26:20.600 align:middle line:10%
if you want to check that out.

00:26:20.600 --> 00:26:22.280 align:middle line:10%
So let's move on.

00:26:22.280 --> 00:26:26.120 align:middle line:10%
"The Chicago Tribune,"
August 13, 1977,

00:26:26.120 --> 00:26:28.140 align:middle line:10%
the CIA'S crystal ball.

00:26:28.140 --> 00:26:30.770 align:middle line:10%
"We once found a guy that
could see anywhere in the world

00:26:30.770 --> 00:26:32.250 align:middle line:10%
through his psychic powers.

00:26:32.250 --> 00:26:34.940 align:middle line:10%
We could show him a
picture of any place,

00:26:34.940 --> 00:26:38.790 align:middle line:10%
and he could describe any
activity going on there.

00:26:38.790 --> 00:26:42.120 align:middle line:10%
But he died, and we haven't
heard from him since."

00:26:42.120 --> 00:26:44.040 align:middle line:10%
CIA Director Stansfield Turner.

00:26:44.040 --> 00:26:46.550 align:middle line:10%
Kind of mysterious
statement, huh?

00:26:46.550 --> 00:26:49.490 align:middle line:10%
If you look into
this person, you

00:26:49.490 --> 00:26:51.615 align:middle line:10%
will see it was a
very mysterious death.

00:26:51.615 --> 00:26:53.240 align:middle line:10%
And of course, we
are talking about one

00:26:53.240 --> 00:26:56.030 align:middle line:10%
of the most psychic men in
the world, a former police

00:26:56.030 --> 00:26:58.230 align:middle line:10%
chief named Pat Price.

00:26:58.230 --> 00:27:00.960 align:middle line:10%
He was an incredible
remote viewer here

00:27:00.960 --> 00:27:03.220 align:middle line:10%
at Stanford Research Institute.

00:27:03.220 --> 00:27:06.270 align:middle line:84%
And just for those of you who
are from the Monroe Institute,

00:27:06.270 --> 00:27:07.330 align:middle line:90%
I am a huge--

00:27:07.330 --> 00:27:08.592 align:middle line:90%
I love the Monroe Institute.

00:27:08.592 --> 00:27:09.550 align:middle line:90%
I have a history there.

00:27:09.550 --> 00:27:12.240 align:middle line:10%
This is Bob Monroe,
if you aren't aware.

00:27:12.240 --> 00:27:16.290 align:middle line:10%
So there was a crossover,
some experiments

00:27:16.290 --> 00:27:19.500 align:middle line:10%
that went on between the
Monroe Institute and Stanford,

00:27:19.500 --> 00:27:22.710 align:middle line:10%
because the Monroe Institute's
very into exploration

00:27:22.710 --> 00:27:26.360 align:middle line:10%
of the mind, out of body, remote
viewing, all of these things.

00:27:26.360 --> 00:27:30.020 align:middle line:10%
So one of Pat's most
famous remote views,

00:27:30.020 --> 00:27:34.290 align:middle line:10%
the top secret NSA facility,
otherwise known as Sugar Grove,

00:27:34.290 --> 00:27:37.460 align:middle line:10%
not only did he draw the
facility and its surroundings,

00:27:37.460 --> 00:27:40.620 align:middle line:10%
but, man, he saw inside it.

00:27:40.620 --> 00:27:44.240 align:middle line:84%
He described the color of the
filing cabinets, the operation

00:27:44.240 --> 00:27:47.540 align:middle line:90%
names, the code names.

00:27:47.540 --> 00:27:50.420 align:middle line:84%
It was an amazing
remote view because it's

00:27:50.420 --> 00:27:52.940 align:middle line:84%
rare to just read
things in a remote view

00:27:52.940 --> 00:27:55.730 align:middle line:84%
because that's actually
a left-brain specialty,

00:27:55.730 --> 00:27:58.590 align:middle line:84%
and it doesn't always
filter into this.

00:27:58.590 --> 00:28:01.170 align:middle line:10%
But for him, easy.

00:28:01.170 --> 00:28:02.190 align:middle line:10%
He could do all of this.

00:28:02.190 --> 00:28:04.760 align:middle line:10%
This is what was so
amazing about him.

00:28:04.760 --> 00:28:07.830 align:middle line:84%
And he had such a high
level of accuracy with this.

00:28:07.830 --> 00:28:10.165 align:middle line:84%
So he provided a list of
project titles associated

00:28:10.165 --> 00:28:11.540 align:middle line:84%
with current and
past activities,

00:28:11.540 --> 00:28:13.680 align:middle line:84%
including one of
extreme sensitivity,

00:28:13.680 --> 00:28:18.060 align:middle line:84%
and it brought in a lot of
attention when this happened.

00:28:18.060 --> 00:28:19.620 align:middle line:90%
This is Ingo Swann.

00:28:19.620 --> 00:28:21.360 align:middle line:84%
I'm sure a lot of you
have heard of him.

00:28:21.360 --> 00:28:24.970 align:middle line:84%
He's like the grandfather
of remote viewing as well.

00:28:24.970 --> 00:28:28.780 align:middle line:84%
And he was part of the
early program at Stanford.

00:28:28.780 --> 00:28:31.350 align:middle line:84%
And when they were trying
to determine if ESP is real,

00:28:31.350 --> 00:28:33.570 align:middle line:90%
is it repeatable at will?

00:28:33.570 --> 00:28:35.880 align:middle line:84%
It's really what the remote
viewing program was there

00:28:35.880 --> 00:28:40.230 align:middle line:84%
to find out because they
heard that the Soviets had

00:28:40.230 --> 00:28:43.780 align:middle line:84%
psychic spies that were finding
out information about them.

00:28:43.780 --> 00:28:47.410 align:middle line:10%
And of course, the US
was like, is this true?

00:28:47.410 --> 00:28:50.160 align:middle line:10%
If it's true, we need
to train some people

00:28:50.160 --> 00:28:51.820 align:middle line:10%
and figure out how to do this.

00:28:51.820 --> 00:28:53.303 align:middle line:10%
Can we do this at will?

00:28:53.303 --> 00:28:54.720 align:middle line:10%
This is another
reason I just want

00:28:54.720 --> 00:28:56.760 align:middle line:10%
to say why remote
viewing is important.

00:28:56.760 --> 00:28:59.490 align:middle line:84%
For many of us, we will
have intuitive hits that

00:28:59.490 --> 00:29:01.680 align:middle line:90%
happen kind of passively to us.

00:29:01.680 --> 00:29:05.940 align:middle line:84%
Remote viewing is more
of an active targeting.

00:29:05.940 --> 00:29:07.950 align:middle line:10%
For people who are
not familiar with it,

00:29:07.950 --> 00:29:10.320 align:middle line:10%
I just wanted to explain
that, another reason why

00:29:10.320 --> 00:29:12.090 align:middle line:10%
it's enjoyable to do.

00:29:12.090 --> 00:29:16.230 align:middle line:10%
You can go after targets.

00:29:16.230 --> 00:29:18.620 align:middle line:10%
So as I said, it
began in the '70s.

00:29:18.620 --> 00:29:20.650 align:middle line:10%
It ended in a
military program that

00:29:20.650 --> 00:29:23.740 align:middle line:10%
was declassified in 1995 that
many people have heard of,

00:29:23.740 --> 00:29:26.385 align:middle line:10%
called Project Stargate,
have many different names,

00:29:26.385 --> 00:29:27.760 align:middle line:10%
but that's what
it ended up with,

00:29:27.760 --> 00:29:29.810 align:middle line:10%
and that's what you
can Google it as.

00:29:29.810 --> 00:29:33.140 align:middle line:10%
And it was funded by the
CIA for more than 20 years.

00:29:33.140 --> 00:29:34.490 align:middle line:10%
This is Joe McMoneagle.

00:29:34.490 --> 00:29:38.350 align:middle line:10%
I'm going to start getting
faster here to get these in.

00:29:38.350 --> 00:29:41.140 align:middle line:10%
Joe was considered
Remote Viewer Number 1.

00:29:41.140 --> 00:29:44.890 align:middle line:10%
He was the first of
the military program.

00:29:44.890 --> 00:29:49.430 align:middle line:10%
He was known to be the most
tested remote viewer ever.

00:29:49.430 --> 00:29:53.380 align:middle line:10%
He did something like 95
live televised remote views,

00:29:53.380 --> 00:29:55.360 align:middle line:10%
and he received the
highest commendation

00:29:55.360 --> 00:29:57.280 align:middle line:10%
that anyone can get in
intelligence services

00:29:57.280 --> 00:30:00.310 align:middle line:10%
in a non-combat role with
the Legion of Merit award

00:30:00.310 --> 00:30:03.100 align:middle line:10%
for service to his country.

00:30:03.100 --> 00:30:07.540 align:middle line:10%
Joe's amazing remote view
was a top secret facility

00:30:07.540 --> 00:30:10.010 align:middle line:10%
that was manufacturing
a new type of submarine,

00:30:10.010 --> 00:30:13.990 align:middle line:10%
the Typhoon class, which was the
submarine featured in The Hunt

00:30:13.990 --> 00:30:15.550 align:middle line:10%
for Red October, by the way.

00:30:15.550 --> 00:30:20.110 align:middle line:10%
When he remote-viewed it,
they said that's impossible

00:30:20.110 --> 00:30:22.090 align:middle line:10%
because we have spies.

00:30:22.090 --> 00:30:24.950 align:middle line:10%
And they haven't come up with
any information like this.

00:30:24.950 --> 00:30:30.040 align:middle line:10%
And Joe said, well, point your
satellites over there dockside

00:30:30.040 --> 00:30:32.270 align:middle line:10%
in 90 to 120 days.

00:30:32.270 --> 00:30:33.470 align:middle line:10%
And they did.

00:30:33.470 --> 00:30:34.760 align:middle line:10%
And they found it.

00:30:34.760 --> 00:30:39.120 align:middle line:10%
So he hit this, and he had all
of this detailed information

00:30:39.120 --> 00:30:39.920 align:middle line:10%
about it.

00:30:39.920 --> 00:30:42.260 align:middle line:10%
It was absolutely incredible.

00:30:42.260 --> 00:30:43.820 align:middle line:10%
So there we go.

00:30:43.820 --> 00:30:45.130 align:middle line:10%
And I just--

00:30:45.130 --> 00:30:48.790 align:middle line:10%
I got to say, here's a
list of clients for anyone

00:30:48.790 --> 00:30:52.210 align:middle line:10%
who still isn't sure if
remote viewing is legit.

00:30:52.210 --> 00:30:54.770 align:middle line:10%
If it's real, here's
a list of clients.

00:30:54.770 --> 00:30:58.210 align:middle line:10%
I can't see it very well
on here, but CIA, DIA,

00:30:58.210 --> 00:31:03.700 align:middle line:10%
Secret Service, Air Force

the ATF, which is the Bureau of
Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms,

00:31:19.950 --> 00:31:21.950 align:middle line:10%
and I think that the Coast
Guard used them, too.

00:31:21.950 --> 00:31:24.130 align:middle line:10%
So just for those
people who are like,

00:31:24.130 --> 00:31:28.110 align:middle line:10%
I'm not sure if I believe this,
somebody believed in this.

00:31:28.110 --> 00:31:29.950 align:middle line:10%
Somebody believed in this.

00:31:29.950 --> 00:31:32.190 align:middle line:84%
So another thing about
these remote viewers,

00:31:32.190 --> 00:31:34.310 align:middle line:84%
that's kind of an
interest to us.

00:31:34.310 --> 00:31:36.180 align:middle line:90%
They've all bumped into ET.

00:31:36.180 --> 00:31:38.860 align:middle line:84%
They all have very
unique reports.

00:31:38.860 --> 00:31:43.530 align:middle line:10%
And once someone
has a track record,

00:31:43.530 --> 00:31:45.300 align:middle line:10%
and they say
something like that,

00:31:45.300 --> 00:31:46.965 align:middle line:10%
we take it a little
more seriously.

00:31:46.965 --> 00:31:49.590 align:middle line:10%
That's why the track record is
so important, because if someone

00:31:49.590 --> 00:31:51.520 align:middle line:10%
just says, I remote
viewed for the first time,

00:31:51.520 --> 00:31:54.210 align:middle line:10%
and they saw these
things, it doesn't

00:31:54.210 --> 00:31:55.840 align:middle line:10%
have quite the same weight.

00:31:55.840 --> 00:31:57.870 align:middle line:10%
That's why we want a
track record, right?

00:31:57.870 --> 00:32:00.920 align:middle line:90%
