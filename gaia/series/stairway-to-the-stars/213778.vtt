00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:11.382 align:middle line:90%


00:00:11.382 --> 00:00:13.590 align:middle line:10%
>> So what I'm going to do
is talk a little bit about

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:17.640 align:middle line:10%
the Knights Templar and see if
we can answer that question that

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:20.570 align:middle line:10%
Tim actually brought up.

00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:24.470 align:middle line:84%
Are the Knights Templar the
guardians of the Holy Grail?

00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:26.280 align:middle line:84%
Well, it's an
interesting question.

00:00:26.280 --> 00:00:27.740 align:middle line:84%
But before you
can answer it, you

00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:31.160 align:middle line:84%
have to define what the
Holy Grail is, right?

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:33.900 align:middle line:90%
Well, what is the Holy Grail?

00:00:33.900 --> 00:00:36.020 align:middle line:84%
Some people think
that it's the cup that

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:39.276 align:middle line:84%
was used at the Last Supper by
Jesus and his guests, right?

00:00:39.276 --> 00:00:41.550 align:middle line:90%
That's one possibility.

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:44.790 align:middle line:84%
Another is that the
Grail is treasure.

00:00:44.790 --> 00:00:46.910 align:middle line:84%
Gold, silver,
jewels, or whatever

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:50.640 align:middle line:84%
it is that you would
define as treasure.

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:54.670 align:middle line:10%
Some people think that
the Holy Grail are relics,

00:00:54.670 --> 00:00:57.900 align:middle line:10%
meaning biological
remains of people

00:00:57.900 --> 00:01:03.810 align:middle line:10%
and other fantastic
ancient artifacts.

00:01:03.810 --> 00:01:05.730 align:middle line:10%
Some people believe
that it's actually

00:01:05.730 --> 00:01:10.500 align:middle line:10%
the bloodline of the royal
family going back through Jesus,

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:13.020 align:middle line:10%
Mary Magdalene,
John the Baptist,

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:16.446 align:middle line:10%
through Egyptian royalty and
beyond to the Atlanteans.

00:01:16.446 --> 00:01:19.050 align:middle line:10%


00:01:19.050 --> 00:01:22.360 align:middle line:10%
Some people think it might
be alchemy or science,

00:01:22.360 --> 00:01:25.260 align:middle line:10%
as Tim talked about at length
just a few minutes ago.

00:01:25.260 --> 00:01:28.890 align:middle line:10%
Others think that it's
spiritual enlightenment.

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:31.260 align:middle line:84%
That is the Holy
Grail, achieving

00:01:31.260 --> 00:01:33.570 align:middle line:90%
spiritual enlightenment.

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:36.910 align:middle line:10%
Others think that it
is the sacred feminine,

00:01:36.910 --> 00:01:40.120 align:middle line:10%
the vessel of the sacred
feminine giving new life, right?

00:01:40.120 --> 00:01:43.280 align:middle line:10%
Maybe that's the Holy Grail.

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:47.150 align:middle line:10%
Still others think that it might
be the new Jerusalem, which

00:01:47.150 --> 00:01:49.430 align:middle line:10%
Tim also touched on
and I'm definitely

00:01:49.430 --> 00:01:51.020 align:middle line:10%
going to touch on today.

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:55.370 align:middle line:84%
So again, we need to
define what this thing is.

00:01:55.370 --> 00:01:57.950 align:middle line:84%
And we're going
to start by where

00:01:57.950 --> 00:02:00.560 align:middle line:84%
I started my whole journey
on this whole thing

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:02.300 align:middle line:90%
with the Kensington Runestone.

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:04.670 align:middle line:10%
Now how many people
have not heard

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:06.510 align:middle line:10%
of the Kensington Runestone?

00:02:06.510 --> 00:02:07.310 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:08.720 align:middle line:90%
A fair number.

00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:11.190 align:middle line:84%
Well, I'm going to tell you
a little bit about this,

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:12.740 align:middle line:84%
and then we're just
going to run off

00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:15.330 align:middle line:84%
into all kinds of
different fun quarters.

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:17.330 align:middle line:90%
So here we go.

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:21.480 align:middle line:84%
This stone is 31 inches
long, 15.5 inches wide,

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:24.790 align:middle line:84%
about 5 and 1/2 inches
thick, weighs 202 pounds.

00:02:24.790 --> 00:02:25.590 align:middle line:90%
It's quite heavy.

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:27.560 align:middle line:84%
I've lifted it a
number of times.

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:33.030 align:middle line:84%
And it was found in Minnesota
back in the fall of 1898.

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:38.580 align:middle line:84%
And that circle, the x with the
circle is where Kensington is.

00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:41.360 align:middle line:84%
It's about a two-hour drive
from Minneapolis Saint

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:43.910 align:middle line:90%
Paul, where we live.

00:02:43.910 --> 00:02:47.160 align:middle line:84%
And in the fall of 1898, the
guy standing in the middle,

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:50.190 align:middle line:84%
a Swedish immigrant farmer
by the name of Olof Ohman,

00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:52.160 align:middle line:84%
was clearing trees
in preparation

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:55.450 align:middle line:84%
for farming with
his two oldest sons.

00:02:55.450 --> 00:02:59.150 align:middle line:84%
Now this is a painting that I
had commissioned many years ago

00:02:59.150 --> 00:03:01.970 align:middle line:84%
that shows the actual moment
of discovery of the Kensington

00:03:01.970 --> 00:03:05.760 align:middle line:84%
Runestone, where Olof Ohman
said he took a grub ax,

00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:08.430 align:middle line:84%
and he cut off the roots
around the base of this tree.

00:03:08.430 --> 00:03:12.850 align:middle line:84%
He took a winch and then he
tipped over this roughly 25

00:03:12.850 --> 00:03:16.310 align:middle line:84%
to 30-year-old aspen tree,
according to 12 witnesses that

00:03:16.310 --> 00:03:19.440 align:middle line:84%
were present shortly
after the discovery.

00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:22.140 align:middle line:84%
And when the tree fell, the
roots came out of the ground,

00:03:22.140 --> 00:03:23.990 align:middle line:84%
and almost directly
underneath the tree

00:03:23.990 --> 00:03:26.360 align:middle line:90%
was this 202 pound stone.

00:03:26.360 --> 00:03:28.220 align:middle line:84%
It was the younger
son, Edward, who

00:03:28.220 --> 00:03:31.970 align:middle line:84%
first noticed that there was
a long inscription carved

00:03:31.970 --> 00:03:33.990 align:middle line:90%
in Scandinavian ruins.

00:03:33.990 --> 00:03:39.800 align:middle line:84%
Now there's a 125-year long
tortured history about this

00:03:39.800 --> 00:03:40.710 align:middle line:90%
artifact.

00:03:40.710 --> 00:03:46.210 align:middle line:84%
And I'll just tell you that
the scholars blew it badly.

00:03:46.210 --> 00:03:48.200 align:middle line:84%
And we're not going to
go into those details,

00:03:48.200 --> 00:03:49.510 align:middle line:90%
but just take my word for it.

00:03:49.510 --> 00:03:54.880 align:middle line:84%
Because if you google
and you get Wikipedia,

00:03:54.880 --> 00:03:58.080 align:middle line:84%
you google Kensington Runestone,
it will say that it is a late

00:03:58.080 --> 00:04:01.480 align:middle line:84%
19th century hoax, and
that's absolutely ridiculous.

00:04:01.480 --> 00:04:06.285 align:middle line:84%
But in any case, I want to
read the inscription to you

00:04:06.285 --> 00:04:08.660 align:middle line:84%
because we're going to come
back to this in a little bit,

00:04:08.660 --> 00:04:10.077 align:middle line:84%
and this is the
thing that they've

00:04:10.077 --> 00:04:12.030 align:middle line:90%
been debating for 125 years.

00:04:12.030 --> 00:04:14.470 align:middle line:84%
It starts with the number
in the upper left hand

00:04:14.470 --> 00:04:18.440 align:middle line:84%
corner of what I call the face
side of the inscription right

00:04:18.440 --> 00:04:19.240 align:middle line:90%
here.

00:04:19.240 --> 00:04:22.040 align:middle line:84%
That number eight
is very sacred.

00:04:22.040 --> 00:04:23.770 align:middle line:84%
We'll get to that
in a little bit.

00:04:23.770 --> 00:04:26.170 align:middle line:84%
But it says eight
Gotlanders, people

00:04:26.170 --> 00:04:27.730 align:middle line:84%
from the island
of Gotland, we'll

00:04:27.730 --> 00:04:33.010 align:middle line:84%
talk about in a little bit, and
22 Northmen on this acquisition

00:04:33.010 --> 00:04:38.330 align:middle line:84%
business/taking up land from
Vinland far to the west.

00:04:38.330 --> 00:04:40.480 align:middle line:84%
Now I don't know
why it is that I'm

00:04:40.480 --> 00:04:43.420 align:middle line:84%
the first person in the
history of this artifact

00:04:43.420 --> 00:04:46.340 align:middle line:90%
to say it's a land claim.

00:04:46.340 --> 00:04:49.200 align:middle line:84%
I mean, acquisition
business taking up land?

00:04:49.200 --> 00:04:51.280 align:middle line:90%
What does that mean to you?

00:04:51.280 --> 00:04:53.710 align:middle line:90%
How come nobody else said this?

00:04:53.710 --> 00:04:54.640 align:middle line:90%
Seriously.

00:04:54.640 --> 00:04:56.520 align:middle line:90%
I mean, what the heck?

00:04:56.520 --> 00:04:58.440 align:middle line:84%
From Vinland far
to the west, we had

00:04:58.440 --> 00:05:03.960 align:middle line:84%
a camp near 2 shelters, 1 day's
journey north from this stone.

00:05:03.960 --> 00:05:08.190 align:middle line:84%
We were fishing one day after
we came home, found 10 men red

00:05:08.190 --> 00:05:10.180 align:middle line:90%
from blood and death.

00:05:10.180 --> 00:05:14.040 align:middle line:84%
And then we have three
Latin letters, AVM.

00:05:14.040 --> 00:05:16.320 align:middle line:84%
Now those of you
who understand Latin

00:05:16.320 --> 00:05:19.150 align:middle line:84%
know that U and V
are interchangeable.

00:05:19.150 --> 00:05:24.820 align:middle line:84%
And I personally think
that it means AUM.

00:05:24.820 --> 00:05:27.340 align:middle line:10%
You heard Tim talk
about that for a second

00:05:27.340 --> 00:05:29.020 align:middle line:10%
in the previous lecture.

00:05:29.020 --> 00:05:32.740 align:middle line:84%
And then the last line, line
nine, it says, save from evils.

00:05:32.740 --> 00:05:34.750 align:middle line:84%
On the split side of the
stone, and the reason

00:05:34.750 --> 00:05:37.270 align:middle line:84%
I say split side
is because whoever

00:05:37.270 --> 00:05:40.570 align:middle line:84%
carved this inscription
took a larger slab of rock

00:05:40.570 --> 00:05:45.100 align:middle line:84%
and intentionally split it down
to the final shape that you see.

00:05:45.100 --> 00:05:49.270 align:middle line:84%
So on that split face, there
are three more lines of text

00:05:49.270 --> 00:05:53.050 align:middle line:84%
that say there are 10
men by the inland sea

00:05:53.050 --> 00:05:55.810 align:middle line:84%
to look after our
ships, 14 days journey

00:05:55.810 --> 00:05:59.330 align:middle line:90%
from this island, year, 1362.

00:05:59.330 --> 00:06:05.124 align:middle line:84%
Now remember, 1362 is 130
years before Chris Columbus.

00:06:05.124 --> 00:06:08.200 align:middle line:84%
You know the guy that never
set foot on the continent

00:06:08.200 --> 00:06:10.990 align:middle line:84%
that we now call the United
States that already had millions

00:06:10.990 --> 00:06:12.580 align:middle line:90%
of people living here?

00:06:12.580 --> 00:06:15.020 align:middle line:84%
I mean, the whole thing
is nonsense, right?

00:06:15.020 --> 00:06:17.500 align:middle line:84%
But this is what we all
grew up with, right?

00:06:17.500 --> 00:06:20.810 align:middle line:90%
This BS story about Columbus.

00:06:20.810 --> 00:06:22.460 align:middle line:90%
But that's another story.

00:06:22.460 --> 00:06:25.920 align:middle line:84%
So obviously, that didn't fit
the narrative of the time.

00:06:25.920 --> 00:06:30.760 align:middle line:84%
So it had to be a fake,
and it was dismissed.

00:06:30.760 --> 00:06:35.980 align:middle line:84%
So let's flash forward
from 1898 to the year 2000.

00:06:35.980 --> 00:06:38.470 align:middle line:84%
And here I am looking at
the Kensington Runestone

00:06:38.470 --> 00:06:40.820 align:middle line:84%
the first day that it
was brought into my lab.

00:06:40.820 --> 00:06:44.560 align:middle line:84%
Now I run a materials
forensic laboratory

00:06:44.560 --> 00:06:46.220 align:middle line:90%
in Saint Paul, Minnesota.

00:06:46.220 --> 00:06:48.380 align:middle line:90%
I'm a geologist by education.

00:06:48.380 --> 00:06:50.810 align:middle line:84%
I'm a licensed
geologist by profession.

00:06:50.810 --> 00:06:56.020 align:middle line:84%
And in our laboratory, we do
material forensics or autopsies

00:06:56.020 --> 00:06:58.610 align:middle line:84%
on concrete and
rock, if you will.

00:06:58.610 --> 00:07:01.520 align:middle line:84%
If the concrete has low
strength, if it cracks,

00:07:01.520 --> 00:07:04.190 align:middle line:84%
if the top comes off,
they send samples to us.

00:07:04.190 --> 00:07:05.300 align:middle line:90%
We'll analyze it.

00:07:05.300 --> 00:07:07.480 align:middle line:84%
We'll figure out what
caused the problem.

00:07:07.480 --> 00:07:09.730 align:middle line:84%
And then of course, the big
question they want to know

00:07:09.730 --> 00:07:11.450 align:middle line:90%
is whose fault is it?

00:07:11.450 --> 00:07:13.112 align:middle line:90%
Who's going to pay, right?

00:07:13.112 --> 00:07:14.870 align:middle line:90%
And so that's what we do.

00:07:14.870 --> 00:07:19.300 align:middle line:84%
We work with inorganic
materials, rock and concrete.

00:07:19.300 --> 00:07:23.230 align:middle line:84%
And in 2000, I was approached
by a representative

00:07:23.230 --> 00:07:24.440 align:middle line:90%
for the Runestone Museum.

00:07:24.440 --> 00:07:27.260 align:middle line:84%
They said, we'd like you to look
at the Kensington Runestone.

00:07:27.260 --> 00:07:29.960 align:middle line:90%
And I said, what is that?

00:07:29.960 --> 00:07:31.180 align:middle line:90%
I never heard of it.

00:07:31.180 --> 00:07:32.850 align:middle line:90%
I didn't know anything about it.

00:07:32.850 --> 00:07:35.340 align:middle line:84%
Everybody else around
me knew what it was.

00:07:35.340 --> 00:07:36.830 align:middle line:84%
And the only thing
I can conclude

00:07:36.830 --> 00:07:38.490 align:middle line:84%
is I must have missed
school that day.

00:07:38.490 --> 00:07:40.920 align:middle line:84%
I had no idea what they
were talking about.

00:07:40.920 --> 00:07:44.340 align:middle line:84%
But eventually, after we
had our initial discussion,

00:07:44.340 --> 00:07:47.430 align:middle line:84%
I could tell this person was
an advocate for authenticity.

00:07:47.430 --> 00:07:50.160 align:middle line:84%
And I said, look, I'll
do this work for you,

00:07:50.160 --> 00:07:54.210 align:middle line:84%
but you have to understand
that when I get done,

00:07:54.210 --> 00:07:57.965 align:middle line:84%
I may come back and give you
news you're not going to like.

00:07:57.965 --> 00:08:00.420 align:middle line:84%
And you're still
going to pay me.

00:08:00.420 --> 00:08:01.850 align:middle line:84%
Because the
beautiful thing is it

00:08:01.850 --> 00:08:04.760 align:middle line:84%
doesn't matter what the results
are, I get paid either way.

00:08:04.760 --> 00:08:09.060 align:middle line:84%
Now not to brag, but we have
done some pretty amazing

00:08:09.060 --> 00:08:11.170 align:middle line:84%
projects that we've
worked on over the years.

00:08:11.170 --> 00:08:14.130 align:middle line:84%
We looked at all the fire
damaged concrete at the Pentagon

00:08:14.130 --> 00:08:15.480 align:middle line:90%
after 9/11.

00:08:15.480 --> 00:08:20.490 align:middle line:84%
We looked at all the concrete
at the condo collapse

00:08:20.490 --> 00:08:24.490 align:middle line:84%
in Southern Florida
and some other things.

00:08:24.490 --> 00:08:26.713 align:middle line:90%
So we've done some work.

00:08:26.713 --> 00:08:28.380 align:middle line:84%
And I like to think
the reason that they

00:08:28.380 --> 00:08:30.760 align:middle line:84%
came to us is because we
know what we're doing.

00:08:30.760 --> 00:08:33.360 align:middle line:84%
But if you go on
the internet, you'll

00:08:33.360 --> 00:08:35.260 align:middle line:90%
get all kinds of crazy stuff.

00:08:35.260 --> 00:08:37.950 align:middle line:84%
And all I can say to people
that want to be famous

00:08:37.950 --> 00:08:41.490 align:middle line:84%
is careful what you wish for
because you might get it.

00:08:41.490 --> 00:08:46.020 align:middle line:84%
Anyway, and you can see what
the Runestone has done to me.

00:08:46.020 --> 00:08:48.470 align:middle line:90%
I used to have dark hair.

00:08:48.470 --> 00:08:50.420 align:middle line:90%
Not anymore.

00:08:50.420 --> 00:08:54.210 align:middle line:84%
So the Runestone is a
very complicated rock.

00:08:54.210 --> 00:08:56.550 align:middle line:84%
It's comprised of 16
different minerals.

00:08:56.550 --> 00:09:00.350 align:middle line:84%
It's actually a
Paleoproterozoic metagreywacke.

00:09:00.350 --> 00:09:02.070 align:middle line:84%
I don't see anybody
writing this down.

00:09:02.070 --> 00:09:02.970 align:middle line:90%
There's a quiz later.

00:09:02.970 --> 00:09:04.980 align:middle line:90%
Come on.

00:09:04.980 --> 00:09:07.415 align:middle line:84%
So this rock is
very complicated.

00:09:07.415 --> 00:09:08.590 align:middle line:90%
It has lots of minerals.

00:09:08.590 --> 00:09:10.710 align:middle line:84%
So I had a lot of
minerals to choose from

00:09:10.710 --> 00:09:12.960 align:middle line:90%
to do my weathering study.

00:09:12.960 --> 00:09:17.370 align:middle line:84%
And at the end of the day, I
chose these flat platy minerals

00:09:17.370 --> 00:09:19.920 align:middle line:84%
right here, which
are called micas.

00:09:19.920 --> 00:09:24.130 align:middle line:84%
And basically, what happened is
this rock was a glacial erratic.

00:09:24.130 --> 00:09:26.460 align:middle line:84%
The glacier plucked it
up out of the bedrock

00:09:26.460 --> 00:09:28.740 align:middle line:84%
and carried it presumably
into the Kensington

00:09:28.740 --> 00:09:31.510 align:middle line:90%
area where these guys found it.

00:09:31.510 --> 00:09:33.990 align:middle line:84%
They split it down, and
then carved the inscription,

00:09:33.990 --> 00:09:37.880 align:middle line:84%
and buried it roughly
a foot into the ground.

00:09:37.880 --> 00:09:41.680 align:middle line:84%
And so what I did was I took
a core sample out of the back.

00:09:41.680 --> 00:09:44.420 align:middle line:84%
I drilled a hole and
pulled out this core.

00:09:44.420 --> 00:09:47.960 align:middle line:84%
And so when you snap it
off, basically you're

00:09:47.960 --> 00:09:50.550 align:middle line:84%
looking at the rock
that's unweathered, right?

00:09:50.550 --> 00:09:51.620 align:middle line:90%
It's fresh.

00:09:51.620 --> 00:09:54.510 align:middle line:84%
And what happens is you
get a surface like this.

00:09:54.510 --> 00:09:55.920 align:middle line:90%
Micas are very soft.

00:09:55.920 --> 00:09:59.130 align:middle line:84%
They have about the
hardness of playing cards.

00:09:59.130 --> 00:10:02.550 align:middle line:84%
So when it fractures, or
breaks, or cracks, or carved,

00:10:02.550 --> 00:10:05.040 align:middle line:84%
it will fail along
the weakest minerals.

00:10:05.040 --> 00:10:07.520 align:middle line:84%
That's why we see
these platy minerals.

00:10:07.520 --> 00:10:12.680 align:middle line:84%
But on the top of the core, when
that glacier was dropped off,

00:10:12.680 --> 00:10:16.990 align:middle line:84%
dropped it off, it had a surface
on the entire surface like this.

00:10:16.990 --> 00:10:21.700 align:middle line:84%
But what we have now, 10,000
to 12,000 years later is this.

00:10:21.700 --> 00:10:24.490 align:middle line:90%
All the micas are gone.

00:10:24.490 --> 00:10:26.960 align:middle line:84%
Now I wasn't surprised
to see this at all.

00:10:26.960 --> 00:10:28.460 align:middle line:90%
In fact, I expected it.

00:10:28.460 --> 00:10:31.180 align:middle line:84%
I knew that over 10,000
years of weathering,

00:10:31.180 --> 00:10:35.620 align:middle line:84%
these would all come off the
surface through mechanical,

00:10:35.620 --> 00:10:40.240 align:middle line:84%
and wetting, and drying,
and freeze-thaw processes.

00:10:40.240 --> 00:10:43.690 align:middle line:84%
But what I didn't
expect is what happened

00:10:43.690 --> 00:10:47.890 align:middle line:84%
when I took a chip sample
off the split side that

00:10:47.890 --> 00:10:50.720 align:middle line:84%
was made at the same time the
inscription was carved, right?

00:10:50.720 --> 00:10:54.130 align:middle line:84%
You can't carve on a
surface until you create it

00:10:54.130 --> 00:10:55.640 align:middle line:90%
on that split side.

00:10:55.640 --> 00:10:59.170 align:middle line:84%
And when the image came up in
the scanning electron microscope

00:10:59.170 --> 00:11:02.760 align:middle line:84%
at 500x magnification,
I started laughing.

00:11:02.760 --> 00:11:05.520 align:middle line:90%


00:11:05.520 --> 00:11:07.650 align:middle line:90%
All the micas were gone.

00:11:07.650 --> 00:11:12.130 align:middle line:84%
I knew intuitively that that
took a long time to happen

00:11:12.130 --> 00:11:15.180 align:middle line:84%
and that it was impossible
for this farmer who

00:11:15.180 --> 00:11:17.820 align:middle line:84%
was accused of carving
the stone to have done it.

00:11:17.820 --> 00:11:21.400 align:middle line:84%
Now I then went and
did a tombstone study.

00:11:21.400 --> 00:11:23.260 align:middle line:90%
I had to go to the East Coast.

00:11:23.260 --> 00:11:28.410 align:middle line:84%
I took samples with permission
off of Revolutionary War era

00:11:28.410 --> 00:11:29.650 align:middle line:90%
tombstones.

00:11:29.650 --> 00:11:33.330 align:middle line:84%
And I just went back in
time on these tombstones

00:11:33.330 --> 00:11:36.450 align:middle line:84%
until the mica minerals,
same mineral grain

00:11:36.450 --> 00:11:38.760 align:middle line:84%
size, same weathering
environment

00:11:38.760 --> 00:11:43.260 align:middle line:84%
at above and below grade
until those minerals

00:11:43.260 --> 00:11:45.100 align:middle line:90%
began to come off the surface.

00:11:45.100 --> 00:11:48.390 align:middle line:84%
That happened at
about 200 years.

00:11:48.390 --> 00:11:51.120 align:middle line:90%
On the Runestone, they're gone.

00:11:51.120 --> 00:11:53.890 align:middle line:90%
So the Runestone inscription.

00:11:53.890 --> 00:11:55.740 align:middle line:84%
So my conclusion
was the weathering

00:11:55.740 --> 00:11:58.510 align:middle line:90%
is older than 200 years.

00:11:58.510 --> 00:12:02.100 align:middle line:84%
But that's from 1898 when it
was pulled out of the ground

00:12:02.100 --> 00:12:05.050 align:middle line:84%
because it hasn't been in a
weathering environment since.

00:12:05.050 --> 00:12:06.340 align:middle line:90%
So guess what?

00:12:06.340 --> 00:12:07.870 align:middle line:90%
It's authentic.

00:12:07.870 --> 00:12:09.520 align:middle line:90%
And that's what I said.

00:12:09.520 --> 00:12:11.650 align:middle line:84%
I wrote my report,
I published it,

00:12:11.650 --> 00:12:14.190 align:middle line:90%
and then I was ready to move on.

00:12:14.190 --> 00:12:15.870 align:middle line:90%
Not so fast.

00:12:15.870 --> 00:12:18.350 align:middle line:90%
That's when the deluge came.

00:12:18.350 --> 00:12:20.400 align:middle line:90%
That's when the criticism came.

00:12:20.400 --> 00:12:25.640 align:middle line:84%
That's when people were
treating me like feces.

00:12:25.640 --> 00:12:29.690 align:middle line:84%
Now I'm an old football player,
and I'm easy to get along with.

00:12:29.690 --> 00:12:33.990 align:middle line:84%
But you get to a certain
point where that's enough.

00:12:33.990 --> 00:12:37.510 align:middle line:84%
And so I asked the people, I
said, look, I'm not perfect.

00:12:37.510 --> 00:12:38.860 align:middle line:90%
I make mistakes.

00:12:38.860 --> 00:12:42.080 align:middle line:84%
Point out where I made a
mistake, and I'll fix it.

00:12:42.080 --> 00:12:43.710 align:middle line:90%
I didn't make a mistake.

00:12:43.710 --> 00:12:47.110 align:middle line:84%
They just didn't like the
result. Well, toughen up.

00:12:47.110 --> 00:12:49.290 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes, life
doesn't go your way.

00:12:49.290 --> 00:12:51.480 align:middle line:90%
And then it got ugly.

00:12:51.480 --> 00:12:54.840 align:middle line:90%
And then I got pissed, frankly.

00:12:54.840 --> 00:12:57.420 align:middle line:84%
But there's one
thing that I did.

00:12:57.420 --> 00:13:03.210 align:middle line:84%
My faith was well
founded in the rock.

00:13:03.210 --> 00:13:05.040 align:middle line:90%
Rocks don't care.

00:13:05.040 --> 00:13:06.770 align:middle line:90%
Rocks don't have agendas.

00:13:06.770 --> 00:13:09.290 align:middle line:90%
Rocks don't have egos.

00:13:09.290 --> 00:13:11.340 align:middle line:84%
And the rock said
it was authentic.

00:13:11.340 --> 00:13:13.580 align:middle line:90%
Everybody else said it was fake.

00:13:13.580 --> 00:13:15.240 align:middle line:90%
I trust rocks.

00:13:15.240 --> 00:13:18.100 align:middle line:90%
I don't trust some people.

00:13:18.100 --> 00:13:21.050 align:middle line:90%
So the rock says it's authentic.

00:13:21.050 --> 00:13:23.980 align:middle line:84%
That means the next
three things I'm

00:13:23.980 --> 00:13:27.960 align:middle line:84%
about to show you have
got to also be true.

00:13:27.960 --> 00:13:30.470 align:middle line:90%
Logic demands that they're true.

00:13:30.470 --> 00:13:35.540 align:middle line:84%
If this is a real artifact, it
means that somebody carved it.

00:13:35.540 --> 00:13:38.270 align:middle line:84%
They came from some
place over in Europe

00:13:38.270 --> 00:13:42.150 align:middle line:84%
because the old Swedish
language on the stone.

00:13:42.150 --> 00:13:46.110 align:middle line:10%
And they came over here
for some reason, right?

00:13:46.110 --> 00:13:49.540 align:middle line:84%
That's what I said about trying
to figure out after all this.

00:13:49.540 --> 00:13:51.210 align:middle line:84%
I said, the hell with
all these people.

00:13:51.210 --> 00:13:53.460 align:middle line:84%
The hell with these scholars
that obviously don't know

00:13:53.460 --> 00:13:54.585 align:middle line:90%
what they're talking about.

00:13:54.585 --> 00:13:58.860 align:middle line:84%
By the way, my colleagues in
geology that reviewed this work,

00:13:58.860 --> 00:14:00.580 align:middle line:90%
they all said it was good.

00:14:00.580 --> 00:14:04.900 align:middle line:84%
So at that point, I took
five trips to Sweden,

00:14:04.900 --> 00:14:07.570 align:middle line:90%
from 2003 to 2005.

00:14:07.570 --> 00:14:11.990 align:middle line:84%
Because if this thing is
authentic, like the rock says,

00:14:11.990 --> 00:14:15.050 align:middle line:84%
that means all the language
ruins dialect, grammar, dating,

00:14:15.050 --> 00:14:18.640 align:middle line:84%
history, everything must be
consistent with the 14th century

00:14:18.640 --> 00:14:20.290 align:middle line:90%
if it's real, right?

00:14:20.290 --> 00:14:24.645 align:middle line:84%
So I went over there
and found everything.

00:14:24.645 --> 00:14:25.460 align:middle line:90%
Oh, my god.

00:14:25.460 --> 00:14:27.280 align:middle line:84%
This just pissed
'em off even more,

00:14:27.280 --> 00:14:31.640 align:middle line:84%
that this dopey ex-football
player went into their backyard

00:14:31.640 --> 00:14:34.430 align:middle line:84%
to find what they were too
lazy to look for, right?

00:14:34.430 --> 00:14:36.890 align:middle line:90%
Because it's a fake, why bother?

00:14:36.890 --> 00:14:38.480 align:middle line:90%
The rock was right.

00:14:38.480 --> 00:14:40.850 align:middle line:90%
Of course, the rock was right.

00:14:40.850 --> 00:14:43.010 align:middle line:84%
But one of the things
that I realized

00:14:43.010 --> 00:14:46.310 align:middle line:84%
was that all the evidence, all
the language, runes, dialect,

00:14:46.310 --> 00:14:49.370 align:middle line:84%
grammar, features that
were on the Runestone,

00:14:49.370 --> 00:14:52.610 align:middle line:84%
I found on grave slabs,
medieval grave slabs

00:14:52.610 --> 00:14:54.990 align:middle line:84%
on this island in the
middle of the Baltic Sea.

00:14:54.990 --> 00:14:57.360 align:middle line:90%
Anybody ever heard of Gotland?

00:14:57.360 --> 00:14:58.160 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:14:58.160 --> 00:14:59.868 align:middle line:84%
That's where all the
people in the region

00:14:59.868 --> 00:15:02.270 align:middle line:84%
go on vacation in
the summertime.

00:15:02.270 --> 00:15:05.520 align:middle line:84%
It's part of Sweden now, and it
was part of Sweden back then.

00:15:05.520 --> 00:15:07.992 align:middle line:84%
And that's where all
the evidence was.

00:15:07.992 --> 00:15:09.950 align:middle line:84%
Now the other thing that
you have to understand

00:15:09.950 --> 00:15:12.890 align:middle line:84%
is that the only person
capable of carving

00:15:12.890 --> 00:15:15.980 align:middle line:84%
an inscription of this
complexity and length

00:15:15.980 --> 00:15:17.760 align:middle line:84%
had to be a member
of the clergy, right?

00:15:17.760 --> 00:15:20.160 align:middle line:84%
At that time in
the 14th century,

00:15:20.160 --> 00:15:23.420 align:middle line:84%
the common people weren't
educated by design.

00:15:23.420 --> 00:15:26.570 align:middle line:84%
So what clergy did
we have on Gotland?

00:15:26.570 --> 00:15:28.970 align:middle line:90%
One, and only one.

00:15:28.970 --> 00:15:29.940 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:15:29.940 --> 00:15:31.380 align:middle line:90%
You got to understand something.

00:15:31.380 --> 00:15:33.810 align:middle line:84%
This is totally new
to me at this time.

00:15:33.810 --> 00:15:38.450 align:middle line:84%
I know nothing about clergy
and about the Cistercians,

00:15:38.450 --> 00:15:44.430 align:middle line:84%
who are the only clergy that
we had on Gotland at that time.

00:15:44.430 --> 00:15:48.210 align:middle line:84%
What's interesting is that there
were 99 churches on this island.

00:15:48.210 --> 00:15:51.650 align:middle line:84%
And I went to every one because
I'm an anal retentive lab

00:15:51.650 --> 00:15:53.355 align:middle line:90%
guy, right?

00:15:53.355 --> 00:15:54.540 align:middle line:90%
All Cistercian.

00:15:54.540 --> 00:15:56.930 align:middle line:84%
And boy, I learned
a lot of cool things

00:15:56.930 --> 00:16:02.970 align:middle line:84%
about these white monks, who
were led by this guy, Bernard

00:16:02.970 --> 00:16:03.770 align:middle line:90%
de Clairvaux.

00:16:03.770 --> 00:16:05.720 align:middle line:84%
How many people have
heard of Bernard?

00:16:05.720 --> 00:16:06.520 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:16:06.520 --> 00:16:07.780 align:middle line:90%
A fair number.

00:16:07.780 --> 00:16:11.260 align:middle line:84%
This guy is one of the
most important figures

00:16:11.260 --> 00:16:15.700 align:middle line:84%
in the history of the world, and
hardly anybody knows who he is.

00:16:15.700 --> 00:16:17.720 align:middle line:84%
Now, Tim touched
on this briefly,

00:16:17.720 --> 00:16:20.130 align:middle line:84%
but I want to dive a little
bit deeper into this.

00:16:20.130 --> 00:16:23.800 align:middle line:84%
Bernard joined the order
in 1113 that had already

00:16:23.800 --> 00:16:28.330 align:middle line:84%
been founded around 1095
by Robert Molesme, who

00:16:28.330 --> 00:16:32.080 align:middle line:84%
established the first
abbey at Citeaux France.

00:16:32.080 --> 00:16:37.120 align:middle line:84%
Bernard joined the order at
Citeaux with 30 family members,

00:16:37.120 --> 00:16:40.400 align:middle line:84%
including the first grand
master, Hugues de Payens,

00:16:40.400 --> 00:16:41.830 align:middle line:90%
who was his uncle.

00:16:41.830 --> 00:16:45.880 align:middle line:84%
Another one of those original
nine Knights was also his uncle.

00:16:45.880 --> 00:16:48.860 align:middle line:84%
And they all joined
at the same time.

00:16:48.860 --> 00:16:50.570 align:middle line:90%
Now make no mistake.

00:16:50.570 --> 00:16:55.010 align:middle line:84%
This was intentional, and it
was a coup d'etat in the making,

00:16:55.010 --> 00:16:57.190 align:middle line:90%
and it was all planned.

00:16:57.190 --> 00:17:02.420 align:middle line:84%
Now two years later, Bernard
founded the first daughter abbey

00:17:02.420 --> 00:17:03.420 align:middle line:90%
at Clairvaux.

00:17:03.420 --> 00:17:06.079 align:middle line:84%
That's why they call him
Bernard of Clairvaux.

00:17:06.079 --> 00:17:09.290 align:middle line:84%
And by the time he
died in 1153, there

00:17:09.290 --> 00:17:14.030 align:middle line:84%
were over 300 Cistercian abbeys
all across Europe, Scandinavia,

00:17:14.030 --> 00:17:15.240 align:middle line:90%
into the Holy Land.

00:17:15.240 --> 00:17:16.710 align:middle line:90%
Now think about that.

00:17:16.710 --> 00:17:20.660 align:middle line:84%
The growth, the explosion
in the growth of this order

00:17:20.660 --> 00:17:21.630 align:middle line:90%
is incredible.

00:17:21.630 --> 00:17:24.260 align:middle line:90%
It would make McDonalds blush.

00:17:24.260 --> 00:17:26.040 align:middle line:90%
No, I'm dead serious, right?

00:17:26.040 --> 00:17:30.230 align:middle line:84%
Anyway, by the time
the order was-- oh.

00:17:30.230 --> 00:17:33.930 align:middle line:84%
Well, by the time the Templars
were put down in 1307,

00:17:33.930 --> 00:17:37.270 align:middle line:84%
they were over 750
Cistercian abbeys.

00:17:37.270 --> 00:17:40.920 align:middle line:10%
They became immensely wealthy
through animal husbandry,

00:17:40.920 --> 00:17:45.570 align:middle line:10%
farming, shipping, and selling
at these merchant fairs.

00:17:45.570 --> 00:17:49.250 align:middle line:10%
They completely redid the
whole economic model of Europe

00:17:49.250 --> 00:17:50.400 align:middle line:10%
at that time.

00:17:50.400 --> 00:17:52.670 align:middle line:84%
But what's also
important is Bernard

00:17:52.670 --> 00:17:55.910 align:middle line:84%
was the one who wrote the
charter for the Knights Templar

00:17:55.910 --> 00:17:57.050 align:middle line:90%
order.

00:17:57.050 --> 00:17:58.870 align:middle line:90%
He was the one.

00:17:58.870 --> 00:18:01.720 align:middle line:84%
And he was their
guardian, basically.

00:18:01.720 --> 00:18:04.120 align:middle line:84%
He was what they
call a pope-maker.

00:18:04.120 --> 00:18:07.200 align:middle line:84%
There was no important
decision in Christendom

00:18:07.200 --> 00:18:09.870 align:middle line:84%
that was ever made
without his counsel.

00:18:09.870 --> 00:18:14.020 align:middle line:84%
We cannot stress the
importance of this guy.

00:18:14.020 --> 00:18:17.130 align:middle line:84%
Now you've got to remember, I
know nothing about this, right?

00:18:17.130 --> 00:18:19.090 align:middle line:84%
I just followed
the evidence trail.

00:18:19.090 --> 00:18:21.000 align:middle line:84%
It took me right
to the Cistercians

00:18:21.000 --> 00:18:22.870 align:middle line:90%
and right to the Templars.

00:18:22.870 --> 00:18:24.910 align:middle line:84%
That's how I got
to the Templars.

00:18:24.910 --> 00:18:28.610 align:middle line:84%
Now people criticize me for
saying, oh, it's the Templars.

00:18:28.610 --> 00:18:29.820 align:middle line:90%
Isn't that convenient?

00:18:29.820 --> 00:18:30.950 align:middle line:90%
It's always the Templars.

00:18:30.950 --> 00:18:31.750 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:18:31.750 --> 00:18:34.810 align:middle line:84%
Follow the evidence trail, and
it'll take you right to him.

00:18:34.810 --> 00:18:36.550 align:middle line:90%
That's how it happened.

00:18:36.550 --> 00:18:39.830 align:middle line:10%
That's Hugues de
Payens right there.

00:18:39.830 --> 00:18:43.340 align:middle line:10%
Now at this point, I
want to just do something

00:18:43.340 --> 00:18:45.330 align:middle line:10%
that I haven't
talked about before,

00:18:45.330 --> 00:18:48.390 align:middle line:10%
but Tim and I agreed it's
time that we talk about it.

00:18:48.390 --> 00:18:50.510 align:middle line:84%
And that is the
true Templar lineage

00:18:50.510 --> 00:18:52.770 align:middle line:90%
begins with the Atlanteans.

00:18:52.770 --> 00:18:55.120 align:middle line:90%
And he touched on this.

00:18:55.120 --> 00:18:59.560 align:middle line:84%
Basically, the ideological
and biological ancestors

00:18:59.560 --> 00:19:05.150 align:middle line:84%
of the Atlanteans are
these Burgundian families

00:19:05.150 --> 00:19:08.880 align:middle line:84%
that founded the Templars and
actually were the Templars.

00:19:08.880 --> 00:19:12.120 align:middle line:84%
And the reason they came
back is in the year 1000,

00:19:12.120 --> 00:19:15.200 align:middle line:84%
when the church said that
the Messiah would return,

00:19:15.200 --> 00:19:18.180 align:middle line:84%
and he didn't, they
were vulnerable.

00:19:18.180 --> 00:19:21.720 align:middle line:90%
And that's when they struck.

00:19:21.720 --> 00:19:24.200 align:middle line:84%
Their method was brilliant
because they aligned

00:19:24.200 --> 00:19:27.440 align:middle line:84%
with the Roman Catholic Church
pretending to be Catholic

00:19:27.440 --> 00:19:31.040 align:middle line:84%
when in fact, they embraced an
ancient ideology that goes way

00:19:31.040 --> 00:19:35.490 align:middle line:84%
back to the Atlanteans, the
pre-flood, the pre-Younger,

00:19:35.490 --> 00:19:37.880 align:middle line:90%
Dryas period.

00:19:37.880 --> 00:19:41.570 align:middle line:84%
And that was about 13,000 years
ago when something catastrophic

00:19:41.570 --> 00:19:45.060 align:middle line:84%
happened that the Atlanteans
knew was going to happen.

00:19:45.060 --> 00:19:47.540 align:middle line:84%
So they prepared
for this cataclysm,

00:19:47.540 --> 00:19:49.860 align:middle line:90%
and they hid their technology.

00:19:49.860 --> 00:19:52.160 align:middle line:84%
And Tim talked about
this at length.

00:19:52.160 --> 00:19:56.700 align:middle line:84%
Their history, their
knowledge of the world,

00:19:56.700 --> 00:20:02.120 align:middle line:84%
about technology, science,
alchemy, all of it.

00:20:02.120 --> 00:20:06.230 align:middle line:84%
And they left it for their
ancestors to recover someday,

00:20:06.230 --> 00:20:08.200 align:middle line:84%
to eventually take
that knowledge

00:20:08.200 --> 00:20:13.770 align:middle line:84%
and rebuild the new Atlantis, as
brother Francis Bacon coined it.

00:20:13.770 --> 00:20:18.990 align:middle line:84%
And they began that work in
1100 by founding the order,

00:20:18.990 --> 00:20:20.860 align:middle line:90%
capturing Jerusalem.

00:20:20.860 --> 00:20:22.600 align:middle line:90%
And it wasn't for Christendom.

00:20:22.600 --> 00:20:26.140 align:middle line:84%
It was to establish a base
of operations in the region,

00:20:26.140 --> 00:20:29.400 align:middle line:84%
so they could go into Egypt,
into Lebanon, and Jordan,

00:20:29.400 --> 00:20:33.790 align:middle line:84%
and Israel, and collect that
stuff that they knew was there.

00:20:33.790 --> 00:20:35.980 align:middle line:90%
They didn't discover anything.

00:20:35.980 --> 00:20:39.600 align:middle line:90%
This was a recovery mission.

00:20:39.600 --> 00:20:42.220 align:middle line:10%
And these are some of the
things that they recovered.

00:20:42.220 --> 00:20:46.920 align:middle line:10%
Now Tim showed you this
cross on this Sumerian

00:20:46.920 --> 00:20:51.090 align:middle line:10%
bas-relief carving, and that
is the equilateral cross

00:20:51.090 --> 00:20:55.770 align:middle line:10%
that became the red cross on
the white mantle or white tunics

00:20:55.770 --> 00:20:56.980 align:middle line:10%
of the Knights Templar.

00:20:56.980 --> 00:20:59.500 align:middle line:84%
But that was the
symbol of Atlantis.

00:20:59.500 --> 00:21:02.070 align:middle line:84%
And it became the
symbol of the Templars.

00:21:02.070 --> 00:21:05.130 align:middle line:84%
And it's also found in
the Indigenous cultures

00:21:05.130 --> 00:21:07.090 align:middle line:84%
because they know
all about this too.

00:21:07.090 --> 00:21:11.040 align:middle line:84%
I'll talk about them
in a little bit later.

00:21:11.040 --> 00:21:13.410 align:middle line:90%
There you have it.

00:21:13.410 --> 00:21:18.420 align:middle line:84%
So Tim talked about Egypt
and about the Temple

00:21:18.420 --> 00:21:21.450 align:middle line:84%
of ISIS and the
Templar cross graffiti

00:21:21.450 --> 00:21:24.160 align:middle line:90%
from our ideological ancestors.

00:21:24.160 --> 00:21:25.810 align:middle line:90%
I'm also a Knights Templar.

00:21:25.810 --> 00:21:28.800 align:middle line:84%
But they carved their graffiti
at these important places

00:21:28.800 --> 00:21:30.250 align:middle line:90%
where they spent their time.

00:21:30.250 --> 00:21:32.410 align:middle line:84%
Tim talked a little
bit about Gobekli Tepe,

00:21:32.410 --> 00:21:35.970 align:middle line:84%
but there's another site that's
only 2 and 1/2 miles away called

00:21:35.970 --> 00:21:37.170 align:middle line:90%
Bendall Tepe.

00:21:37.170 --> 00:21:40.570 align:middle line:84%
And if you look from
these drone footages,

00:21:40.570 --> 00:21:45.940 align:middle line:84%
you can see the remnants of
some ancient diggings and/or

00:21:45.940 --> 00:21:47.960 align:middle line:90%
some ancient structures.

00:21:47.960 --> 00:21:53.410 align:middle line:84%
And this is that picture
that I got from some people

00:21:53.410 --> 00:21:54.680 align:middle line:90%
and I gave to Tim.

00:21:54.680 --> 00:21:56.680 align:middle line:84%
And Tim said,
absolutely, this is

00:21:56.680 --> 00:22:01.130 align:middle line:84%
Templar graffiti from their
time spent at Gobekli Tepe.

00:22:01.130 --> 00:22:04.290 align:middle line:84%
Now most people know
what that site is, right?

00:22:04.290 --> 00:22:08.050 align:middle line:84%
It's basically an
ancient observatory.

00:22:08.050 --> 00:22:11.570 align:middle line:84%
Very important, this
whole concept of as above,

00:22:11.570 --> 00:22:13.660 align:middle line:90%
so below in a real sense, right?

00:22:13.660 --> 00:22:15.950 align:middle line:90%
A practical sense.

00:22:15.950 --> 00:22:16.850 align:middle line:90%
They were there.

00:22:16.850 --> 00:22:23.290 align:middle line:84%
Gobekli Tepe is only 2 and
1/2 miles from Bendell Tepe,

00:22:23.290 --> 00:22:25.070 align:middle line:90%
from this site.

00:22:25.070 --> 00:22:28.380 align:middle line:84%
So it's probably all
part of the same complex.

00:22:28.380 --> 00:22:35.350 align:middle line:84%
But keep in mind, Gobekli Tepe
was covered up 13,000 years ago.

00:22:35.350 --> 00:22:37.030 align:middle line:84%
The reason they
covered it up is they

00:22:37.030 --> 00:22:39.430 align:middle line:90%
knew a catastrophe was coming.

00:22:39.430 --> 00:22:42.220 align:middle line:84%
Probably our solar
system interacting

00:22:42.220 --> 00:22:48.140 align:middle line:84%
with a meteorite shower or
some type of cataclysmic event.

00:22:48.140 --> 00:22:49.600 align:middle line:90%
I think it was a meteor shower.

00:22:49.600 --> 00:22:51.020 align:middle line:90%
There's other theories.

00:22:51.020 --> 00:22:54.180 align:middle line:84%
But the Atlanteans knew
it was going to happen.

00:22:54.180 --> 00:22:56.758 align:middle line:84%
And then you talked about
all the underground tunnels.

00:22:56.758 --> 00:22:58.633 align:middle line:84%
This is where a lot of
these people survived.

00:22:58.633 --> 00:23:01.540 align:middle line:90%


00:23:01.540 --> 00:23:05.620 align:middle line:84%
Just the people that
survive are the ancestors

00:23:05.620 --> 00:23:07.150 align:middle line:90%
of our Templar order.

00:23:07.150 --> 00:23:09.580 align:middle line:90%
And there's Gobekli Tepe.

00:23:09.580 --> 00:23:13.520 align:middle line:84%
Now getting back to
the Templars early on.

00:23:13.520 --> 00:23:15.440 align:middle line:84%
Now remember, this
was my research.

00:23:15.440 --> 00:23:18.940 align:middle line:84%
I did all this on my own, and I
came up with these conclusions

00:23:18.940 --> 00:23:21.200 align:middle line:84%
that a lot of people
seem to agree with me.

00:23:21.200 --> 00:23:23.650 align:middle line:84%
One of the things
that was obvious to me

00:23:23.650 --> 00:23:27.370 align:middle line:84%
is that the Templars had a
fascination with the Virgin Mary

00:23:27.370 --> 00:23:29.755 align:middle line:84%
to the point where even
some of the popes said,

00:23:29.755 --> 00:23:32.380 align:middle line:84%
we like the Virgin Mary too, but
you might want to dial it back

00:23:32.380 --> 00:23:33.440 align:middle line:90%
a little bit.

00:23:33.440 --> 00:23:36.130 align:middle line:84%
One of the things that a
lot of people don't realize

00:23:36.130 --> 00:23:39.640 align:middle line:84%
is that Bernard has
been made into a saint,

00:23:39.640 --> 00:23:43.660 align:middle line:84%
and all the saints have what
they call their miracle that's

00:23:43.660 --> 00:23:45.250 align:middle line:90%
associated with them.

00:23:45.250 --> 00:23:47.770 align:middle line:84%
Bernard's miracle
basically is he

00:23:47.770 --> 00:23:51.820 align:middle line:84%
was preaching to the brethren
in the monastery one day

00:23:51.820 --> 00:23:53.920 align:middle line:84%
in the church, and
there was a statue

00:23:53.920 --> 00:23:55.850 align:middle line:90%
of the Virgin Mary behind him.

00:23:55.850 --> 00:23:58.120 align:middle line:84%
And at one point,
he turned around,

00:23:58.120 --> 00:24:01.390 align:middle line:84%
and the Virgin
exposed her breast

00:24:01.390 --> 00:24:05.630 align:middle line:84%
and squeezed milk
into his mouth.

00:24:05.630 --> 00:24:09.650 align:middle line:84%
Now if you think I'm
making it up, look it up.

00:24:09.650 --> 00:24:13.070 align:middle line:84%
It's the single most
common image of Bernard

00:24:13.070 --> 00:24:16.100 align:middle line:84%
by two to one over
the next common image.

00:24:16.100 --> 00:24:18.890 align:middle line:84%
So the point is they had a
fascination with the Virgin

00:24:18.890 --> 00:24:22.070 align:middle line:84%
Mary, but she didn't
represent the Virgin.

00:24:22.070 --> 00:24:26.432 align:middle line:84%
She represented Isis, the
goddess, all the goddesses,

00:24:26.432 --> 00:24:27.232 align:middle line:90%
right?

00:24:27.232 --> 00:24:30.530 align:middle line:90%
And so they venerated her.

00:24:30.530 --> 00:24:34.850 align:middle line:84%
And you see, here's a 14th
century depiction of the Goddess

00:24:34.850 --> 00:24:37.890 align:middle line:84%
protecting the nuns
and the monks equally.

00:24:37.890 --> 00:24:40.550 align:middle line:84%
Because what you're
seeing here is actually

00:24:40.550 --> 00:24:45.620 align:middle line:84%
a depiction that represents
their true ideology and belief

00:24:45.620 --> 00:24:49.400 align:middle line:84%
systems, which was
monotheistic dualism.

00:24:49.400 --> 00:24:51.800 align:middle line:84%
Now on the Kensington
Runestone, there

00:24:51.800 --> 00:24:56.330 align:middle line:84%
is a symbol that's being used
for the letter A or the A sound.

00:24:56.330 --> 00:25:00.260 align:middle line:84%
And this is not the
rune that it should be.

00:25:00.260 --> 00:25:02.660 align:middle line:10%
And this is one of the
problems that the scholars

00:25:02.660 --> 00:25:05.300 align:middle line:10%
had with the Kensington
Runestone inscription.

00:25:05.300 --> 00:25:07.290 align:middle line:84%
This is not what's
supposed to be there.

00:25:07.290 --> 00:25:10.110 align:middle line:84%
So it's not there, so it must
be wrong, so it must be fake.

00:25:10.110 --> 00:25:11.760 align:middle line:90%
No, that's flawed logic.

00:25:11.760 --> 00:25:14.670 align:middle line:84%
All it means is you've
never seen it before.

00:25:14.670 --> 00:25:16.110 align:middle line:90%
How about work on it?

00:25:16.110 --> 00:25:17.690 align:middle line:90%
How about figure it out?

00:25:17.690 --> 00:25:19.700 align:middle line:90%
How about they didn't?

00:25:19.700 --> 00:25:21.000 align:middle line:90%
But we did.

00:25:21.000 --> 00:25:23.630 align:middle line:84%
And what we determined
was that this actually

00:25:23.630 --> 00:25:25.980 align:middle line:90%
has some important symbolism.

00:25:25.980 --> 00:25:29.160 align:middle line:84%
If you take an x, you chop
it in half horizontally,

00:25:29.160 --> 00:25:34.125 align:middle line:84%
the lower part makes a sword,
a phallic symbol of the male,

00:25:34.125 --> 00:25:34.925 align:middle line:90%
right?

00:25:34.925 --> 00:25:38.740 align:middle line:84%
A v is a vessel, a chalice, the
womb, the symbol for the female.

00:25:38.740 --> 00:25:40.660 align:middle line:84%
When you combine them
together in an x,

00:25:40.660 --> 00:25:43.610 align:middle line:84%
you get this allegorical union
of male and female, heaven

00:25:43.610 --> 00:25:44.410 align:middle line:90%
and Earth.

00:25:44.410 --> 00:25:45.540 align:middle line:90%
Good, bad, light, dark.

00:25:45.540 --> 00:25:48.570 align:middle line:84%
The concept of
dualism, opposites

00:25:48.570 --> 00:25:50.550 align:middle line:90%
that keep things in balance.

00:25:50.550 --> 00:25:56.510 align:middle line:84%
So that's pretty easy to
handle, but what's the hook?

00:25:56.510 --> 00:25:59.270 align:middle line:84%
And I didn't know what this was
until I gave my first lecture

00:25:59.270 --> 00:26:01.310 align:middle line:84%
to the Freemasons
before I became

00:26:01.310 --> 00:26:03.420 align:middle line:84%
a Freemason many,
many years ago.

00:26:03.420 --> 00:26:05.600 align:middle line:84%
And I asked the question,
and a guy raised his hand,

00:26:05.600 --> 00:26:07.670 align:middle line:90%
and he said, a child?

00:26:07.670 --> 00:26:09.280 align:middle line:90%
And I went, bingo.

00:26:09.280 --> 00:26:10.080 align:middle line:90%
That's right.

00:26:10.080 --> 00:26:12.170 align:middle line:84%
Because it hit me
just like that.

00:26:12.170 --> 00:26:14.810 align:middle line:84%
And if you look at it,
basically what we have here

00:26:14.810 --> 00:26:16.940 align:middle line:90%
is a little girl, right?

00:26:16.940 --> 00:26:21.060 align:middle line:84%
Inside the womb of Mama with
daddy down below, right?

00:26:21.060 --> 00:26:24.410 align:middle line:84%
Some people say it
represents the Holy Trinity.

00:26:24.410 --> 00:26:25.630 align:middle line:90%
What's the Holy Trinity?

00:26:25.630 --> 00:26:28.633 align:middle line:90%


00:26:28.633 --> 00:26:30.300 align:middle line:84%
Father, Son, and the
Holy Spirit, right?

00:26:30.300 --> 00:26:31.885 align:middle line:90%
What's the Holy Spirit?

00:26:31.885 --> 00:26:35.670 align:middle line:90%


00:26:35.670 --> 00:26:38.830 align:middle line:84%
The point is it's not
well defined, is it?

00:26:38.830 --> 00:26:39.630 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:26:39.630 --> 00:26:41.400 align:middle line:90%
That's on purpose, by the way.

00:26:41.400 --> 00:26:45.120 align:middle line:84%
Actually, what it means to
me is you got the father,

00:26:45.120 --> 00:26:47.290 align:middle line:90%
you got the child.

00:26:47.290 --> 00:26:48.710 align:middle line:90%
Who's missing?

00:26:48.710 --> 00:26:50.170 align:middle line:90%
Mama, right?

00:26:50.170 --> 00:26:52.510 align:middle line:90%
Maybe that's the Holy Trinity.

00:26:52.510 --> 00:26:55.730 align:middle line:84%
I think that's exactly
what we're seeing here.

00:26:55.730 --> 00:26:59.360 align:middle line:84%
But it represents the
essence of their ideology.

00:26:59.360 --> 00:27:03.040 align:middle line:84%
They believe in a single deity
that had dualistic aspects that

00:27:03.040 --> 00:27:05.010 align:middle line:90%
keep things in balance.

00:27:05.010 --> 00:27:07.900 align:middle line:90%
That was what this symbol means.

00:27:07.900 --> 00:27:09.320 align:middle line:90%
Very important.

00:27:09.320 --> 00:27:10.240 align:middle line:90%
Oh, yeah.

00:27:10.240 --> 00:27:13.690 align:middle line:84%
Somebody talked a little
bit about Egypt too.

00:27:13.690 --> 00:27:16.430 align:middle line:84%
And if you look here,
this is King Tut.

00:27:16.430 --> 00:27:18.460 align:middle line:84%
And if you look at
his father, Akhenaten

00:27:18.460 --> 00:27:20.690 align:middle line:84%
is holding the cross,
crook and the flail.

00:27:20.690 --> 00:27:24.880 align:middle line:84%
And this also gets into
precession of the equinoxes

00:27:24.880 --> 00:27:28.760 align:middle line:84%
and the transition from Taurus
the bull to Aries the ram.

00:27:28.760 --> 00:27:30.760 align:middle line:84%
And that's what's
being depicted here.

00:27:30.760 --> 00:27:33.440 align:middle line:84%
You have the flail,
which herds the bulls,

00:27:33.440 --> 00:27:36.500 align:middle line:84%
the followers of Taurus,
the old religion in Egypt.

00:27:36.500 --> 00:27:39.340 align:middle line:84%
And the crook herds the
rams, the sheep of Aries,

00:27:39.340 --> 00:27:41.030 align:middle line:84%
representing the
new religion, right?

00:27:41.030 --> 00:27:45.640 align:middle line:10%
And his attempt with that
symbolic crossing on his chest

00:27:45.640 --> 00:27:48.720 align:middle line:10%
represented his attempt to
unite the two religions.

00:27:48.720 --> 00:27:50.090 align:middle line:90%
But it failed.

00:27:50.090 --> 00:27:52.260 align:middle line:84%
And of course, the
rest is history.

00:27:52.260 --> 00:27:55.840 align:middle line:84%
But that's how far back
this ideology goes.

00:27:55.840 --> 00:27:59.530 align:middle line:84%
But in fact, it goes back
over 13,000 years ago,

00:27:59.530 --> 00:28:01.800 align:middle line:90%
pre-flood times.

00:28:01.800 --> 00:28:04.380 align:middle line:84%
So let's just spend a
little time for fun,

00:28:04.380 --> 00:28:08.220 align:middle line:84%
looking at some of the esoteric
aspects of the Kensington

00:28:08.220 --> 00:28:10.410 align:middle line:84%
Runestone that are
consistent with who

00:28:10.410 --> 00:28:13.450 align:middle line:90%
we say carved this inscription.

00:28:13.450 --> 00:28:15.430 align:middle line:90%
The Templars.

00:28:15.430 --> 00:28:18.040 align:middle line:10%
Well, first and foremost,
I've talked at length

00:28:18.040 --> 00:28:19.670 align:middle line:10%
about how they split it down.

00:28:19.670 --> 00:28:23.020 align:middle line:10%
And funny, it just so
happens to be a two to one

00:28:23.020 --> 00:28:27.340 align:middle line:10%
ratio of what we call an
oblong square in Freemasonry.

00:28:27.340 --> 00:28:29.020 align:middle line:90%
And why is that important?

00:28:29.020 --> 00:28:32.320 align:middle line:84%
Well, it's important for a lot
of reasons, but one of them

00:28:32.320 --> 00:28:34.880 align:middle line:90%
is the key to sacred geometry.

00:28:34.880 --> 00:28:37.540 align:middle line:84%
Now if you take two circles,
and you push it together,

00:28:37.540 --> 00:28:41.050 align:middle line:84%
and you end up with
three equal spaces,

00:28:41.050 --> 00:28:45.280 align:middle line:84%
you end up with this
vesica piscis in the middle

00:28:45.280 --> 00:28:47.330 align:middle line:90%
of that two to one ratio.

00:28:47.330 --> 00:28:50.800 align:middle line:84%
Now this serves as the
key to sacred geometry

00:28:50.800 --> 00:28:51.940 align:middle line:90%
I'll get to in a sec.

00:28:51.940 --> 00:28:54.310 align:middle line:84%
But it also represents
symbolically

00:28:54.310 --> 00:28:57.910 align:middle line:84%
the allegorical birth canal
of the great goddess, right?

00:28:57.910 --> 00:28:59.330 align:middle line:90%
Where life comes from.

00:28:59.330 --> 00:29:01.880 align:middle line:84%
So it's very important
for a lot of reasons.

00:29:01.880 --> 00:29:05.870 align:middle line:10%
It's also one of the six
arms of the Flower of Life.

00:29:05.870 --> 00:29:07.750 align:middle line:90%
You guys have seen that before.

00:29:07.750 --> 00:29:12.860 align:middle line:84%
But in within that vesica, we
have two equilateral triangles.

00:29:12.860 --> 00:29:15.080 align:middle line:10%
The equilateral
triangle in Freemasonry

00:29:15.080 --> 00:29:19.030 align:middle line:10%
is a symbol of deity, the great
architect of the universe.

00:29:19.030 --> 00:29:21.120 align:middle line:84%
And then it just goes
on and on from there.

00:29:21.120 --> 00:29:25.240 align:middle line:84%
You get the tetractys, and
it just goes there forever.

00:29:25.240 --> 00:29:29.130 align:middle line:84%
But it is the key
to sacred geometry.

00:29:29.130 --> 00:29:31.565 align:middle line:84%
Now this one I have to
give Janet credit for.

00:29:31.565 --> 00:29:32.940 align:middle line:84%
We were looking
at the Runestone.

00:29:32.940 --> 00:29:35.250 align:middle line:84%
And one day, she just
took a tape measure.

00:29:35.250 --> 00:29:37.270 align:middle line:90%
And she said, uh-oh.

00:29:37.270 --> 00:29:38.610 align:middle line:90%
Look at this.

00:29:38.610 --> 00:29:42.270 align:middle line:84%
There is a sacred measurement
that all the megalithic sites

00:29:42.270 --> 00:29:46.270 align:middle line:84%
found around the world were
used to build them with,

00:29:46.270 --> 00:29:48.430 align:middle line:84%
and that's called
the megalithic yard.

00:29:48.430 --> 00:29:51.630 align:middle line:84%
And it's calculated
using the movements

00:29:51.630 --> 00:29:54.760 align:middle line:84%
of the most accurate
heavenly body in the sky,

00:29:54.760 --> 00:29:56.640 align:middle line:90%
and that's the planet Venus.

00:29:56.640 --> 00:30:00.030 align:middle line:84%
And so you use a pendulum,
and you watch the arc

00:30:00.030 --> 00:30:01.690 align:middle line:90%
over a particular period.

00:30:01.690 --> 00:30:04.780 align:middle line:84%
And then you will generate
the megalithic yard,

00:30:04.780 --> 00:30:07.350 align:middle line:90%
which is 2.722 feet.

00:30:07.350 --> 00:30:09.390 align:middle line:84%
And when she took
that tape measure

00:30:09.390 --> 00:30:12.250 align:middle line:84%
and went across
the Runestone, it's

00:30:12.250 --> 00:30:15.070 align:middle line:90%
exactly one megalithic yard.

00:30:15.070 --> 00:30:18.340 align:middle line:90%
Or it's a coincidence.

00:30:18.340 --> 00:30:21.670 align:middle line:90%
I'm going to go with A, OK?

00:30:21.670 --> 00:30:22.470 align:middle line:90%
All right.

00:30:22.470 --> 00:30:24.860 align:middle line:84%
Now I want to tell you
guys about a discovery that

00:30:24.860 --> 00:30:31.250 align:middle line:84%
happened when I became a
Freemason in November of 2015.

00:30:31.250 --> 00:30:34.590 align:middle line:84%
And for those of you, how many
brothers do we have in the room?

00:30:34.590 --> 00:30:37.220 align:middle line:90%
I know we got two for sure.

00:30:37.220 --> 00:30:38.360 align:middle line:90%
And that's it?

00:30:38.360 --> 00:30:38.680 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:30:38.680 --> 00:30:41.000 align:middle line:84%
Well, I'm going to tell you guys
just briefly what Freemasonry

00:30:41.000 --> 00:30:41.800 align:middle line:90%
is.

00:30:41.800 --> 00:30:43.620 align:middle line:84%
So when you first
become a Mason,

00:30:43.620 --> 00:30:45.810 align:middle line:84%
you go through what we
call the blue lodge.

00:30:45.810 --> 00:30:50.450 align:middle line:84%
And it's associated with water
and birth, amniotic fluid,

00:30:50.450 --> 00:30:52.670 align:middle line:84%
and all that stuff,
because you are literally

00:30:52.670 --> 00:30:55.560 align:middle line:84%
going to be reborn at
some point in the degrees.

00:30:55.560 --> 00:30:58.290 align:middle line:84%
It's made up of three degrees,
the entered apprentice,

00:30:58.290 --> 00:31:00.270 align:middle line:84%
the fellowcraft, and
the master mason.

00:31:00.270 --> 00:31:03.090 align:middle line:84%
And at the end, when you're
done, you're on the squad,

00:31:03.090 --> 00:31:05.210 align:middle line:84%
you're a full fledged
Mason, and you

00:31:05.210 --> 00:31:09.480 align:middle line:84%
can stop there, it's all
good, and have a great time.

00:31:09.480 --> 00:31:12.100 align:middle line:84%
However, if you're
interested in seeking

00:31:12.100 --> 00:31:15.620 align:middle line:84%
additional light, the
code word for knowledge,

00:31:15.620 --> 00:31:18.290 align:middle line:84%
there's a couple of
routes that you can take.

00:31:18.290 --> 00:31:20.650 align:middle line:84%
One is called the Scottish
Rite, and the other

00:31:20.650 --> 00:31:22.100 align:middle line:90%
is called the York Rite.

00:31:22.100 --> 00:31:24.260 align:middle line:84%
Now if you go through
the Scottish Rite,

00:31:24.260 --> 00:31:26.160 align:middle line:90%
you start at the fourth degree.

00:31:26.160 --> 00:31:28.040 align:middle line:90%
It builds off of the blue lodge.

00:31:28.040 --> 00:31:32.690 align:middle line:84%
There's a total of 29 degrees
for a total of 32 degrees.

00:31:32.690 --> 00:31:35.875 align:middle line:84%
And then there's a
33rd, which is honorary.

00:31:35.875 --> 00:31:38.000 align:middle line:84%
And if you even talk about
it, you'll never get it,

00:31:38.000 --> 00:31:40.300 align:middle line:84%
so we're not going
to talk about it.

00:31:40.300 --> 00:31:45.820 align:middle line:84%
But the 32nd degree is amazing,
and I have gone through those 32

00:31:45.820 --> 00:31:46.730 align:middle line:90%
degrees.

00:31:46.730 --> 00:31:49.330 align:middle line:84%
The York Rite is a
little different.

00:31:49.330 --> 00:31:50.560 align:middle line:90%
It's made up--

00:31:50.560 --> 00:31:52.630 align:middle line:84%
It also builds off
the blue lodge,

00:31:52.630 --> 00:31:56.660 align:middle line:84%
and there's 10 additional
degrees for a total of 13.

00:31:56.660 --> 00:31:59.030 align:middle line:84%
Now 13 is a very
important number.

00:31:59.030 --> 00:32:01.310 align:middle line:84%
It's part of the
Fibonacci sequence.

00:32:01.310 --> 00:32:05.070 align:middle line:84%
It's also the number
associated with the feminine.

00:32:05.070 --> 00:32:07.830 align:middle line:84%
13 synodic cycles
of the moon, right?

00:32:07.830 --> 00:32:10.330 align:middle line:84%
When women have their
menstrual cycles.

00:32:10.330 --> 00:32:12.850 align:middle line:84%
This is why we call the
moon, the moon goddess.

00:32:12.850 --> 00:32:16.030 align:middle line:84%
It's also associated with Venus,
I'm not going to go into that.

00:32:16.030 --> 00:32:19.810 align:middle line:84%
But it's also associated
with Mother Earth, right?

00:32:19.810 --> 00:32:23.460 align:middle line:84%
That's the trinity of the
feminine in the heavens.

00:32:23.460 --> 00:32:26.700 align:middle line:84%
But again, it starts
with the blue lodge,

00:32:26.700 --> 00:32:30.330 align:middle line:84%
and then there's 10 additional
degrees for a total of 13.

00:32:30.330 --> 00:32:33.760 align:middle line:84%
But those 10 degrees are
broken up into three groups.

00:32:33.760 --> 00:32:36.790 align:middle line:90%
One is called the royal arch.

00:32:36.790 --> 00:32:39.020 align:middle line:84%
The next group, and
that's four degrees.

00:32:39.020 --> 00:32:42.100 align:middle line:84%
the next group is the Cryptic
Council, that's three degrees.

00:32:42.100 --> 00:32:44.570 align:middle line:84%
And the last are the
chivalric degrees.

00:32:44.570 --> 00:32:48.290 align:middle line:84%
And you end up being knighted
as a Knights Templar,

00:32:48.290 --> 00:32:49.930 align:middle line:90%
and I have also done that.

00:32:49.930 --> 00:32:53.420 align:middle line:84%
Now as I was going
through these degrees,

00:32:53.420 --> 00:32:57.060 align:middle line:84%
specifically in the
Cryptic Council,

00:32:57.060 --> 00:33:01.380 align:middle line:84%
something happened
that probably only

00:33:01.380 --> 00:33:06.090 align:middle line:84%
would happen to me because of my
deep knowledge and understanding

00:33:06.090 --> 00:33:08.790 align:middle line:90%
of the Kensington Runestone.

00:33:08.790 --> 00:33:10.780 align:middle line:84%
So when we go
through our degrees,

00:33:10.780 --> 00:33:13.470 align:middle line:84%
they're made up of part
theatrical performance and part

00:33:13.470 --> 00:33:14.700 align:middle line:90%
lecture.

00:33:14.700 --> 00:33:17.260 align:middle line:84%
And after the
theatrical performance,

00:33:17.260 --> 00:33:20.170 align:middle line:84%
there's usually a lecture that's
given by one of the white hats,

00:33:20.170 --> 00:33:21.500 align:middle line:90%
often by the white hats.

00:33:21.500 --> 00:33:23.400 align:middle line:90%
Those are the 33rds.

00:33:23.400 --> 00:33:28.860 align:middle line:84%
And during this particular
degree, and a lot of our degrees

00:33:28.860 --> 00:33:33.460 align:middle line:84%
take place at various
times in biblical history.

00:33:33.460 --> 00:33:35.670 align:middle line:84%
And this one took
place at the time

00:33:35.670 --> 00:33:39.150 align:middle line:84%
of the completion of the
first temple in Jerusalem.

00:33:39.150 --> 00:33:44.650 align:middle line:84%
And there are
three grandmasters.

00:33:44.650 --> 00:33:49.550 align:middle line:84%
King Solomon, Hiram Abiff,
and Hiram King of Tyre,

00:33:49.550 --> 00:33:52.250 align:middle line:84%
which is in Lebanon, where
all the supplies came from,

00:33:52.250 --> 00:33:53.960 align:middle line:90%
the wood and the workers.

00:33:53.960 --> 00:33:56.170 align:middle line:84%
And they decide in this
degree that they're

00:33:56.170 --> 00:34:01.510 align:middle line:84%
going to build a secret vault
nine levels below the sanctum

00:34:01.510 --> 00:34:03.850 align:middle line:84%
sanctorum, the Holy
of Holies, right?

00:34:03.850 --> 00:34:06.460 align:middle line:84%
Where the Ark of the Covenant
and all the true treasures

00:34:06.460 --> 00:34:09.820 align:middle line:84%
inside the Temple of
Solomon were kept.

00:34:09.820 --> 00:34:13.060 align:middle line:84%
And they decided they were going
to put a copy of all these two

00:34:13.060 --> 00:34:19.310 align:middle line:84%
treasures in the secret vault.
So the degree takes place,

00:34:19.310 --> 00:34:22.429 align:middle line:84%
and I don't want to talk
specifically about it.

00:34:22.429 --> 00:34:25.219 align:middle line:84%
But it gets very
bloody at some points.

00:34:25.219 --> 00:34:28.920 align:middle line:84%
Somebody is killed, and
a lot of stuff happens.

00:34:28.920 --> 00:34:32.639 align:middle line:84%
But at the end of the
degree, one of the white hats

00:34:32.639 --> 00:34:34.639 align:middle line:90%
was lecturing.

00:34:34.639 --> 00:34:38.730 align:middle line:84%
And remember, the three grand
masters built the secret vault.

00:34:38.730 --> 00:34:42.380 align:middle line:84%
And then he said, and the
other eight arches were

00:34:42.380 --> 00:34:44.719 align:middle line:90%
built by 22 men from Gebal.

00:34:44.719 --> 00:34:47.659 align:middle line:90%
And I went, eight and 22?

00:34:47.659 --> 00:34:50.540 align:middle line:84%
Those are the first two numbers
in the Kensington Runestone.

00:34:50.540 --> 00:34:52.610 align:middle line:84%
I didn't hear another
thing after that.

00:34:52.610 --> 00:34:54.350 align:middle line:84%
So as soon as the
degree was over,

00:34:54.350 --> 00:34:56.449 align:middle line:84%
I went to my Masonic
mentor, John Friedberg.

00:34:56.449 --> 00:34:58.400 align:middle line:84%
I said, John, is there
a ritual book for this?

00:34:58.400 --> 00:34:59.200 align:middle line:90%
He said, yes.

00:34:59.200 --> 00:35:01.320 align:middle line:90%
I said, give me that.

00:35:01.320 --> 00:35:02.940 align:middle line:90%
And I went through it.

00:35:02.940 --> 00:35:05.640 align:middle line:90%
And oh, my god.

00:35:05.640 --> 00:35:07.950 align:middle line:90%
I couldn't believe it.

00:35:07.950 --> 00:35:10.340 align:middle line:90%
It was in this degree.

00:35:10.340 --> 00:35:15.067 align:middle line:10%
So there's a lot more to this,
and I wrote about it in my book,

00:35:15.067 --> 00:35:17.400 align:middle line:10%
but I just want to touch on
a couple of the high points.

00:35:17.400 --> 00:35:20.040 align:middle line:10%
So the eight arches
and the 22 men,

00:35:20.040 --> 00:35:23.630 align:middle line:10%
there's two guards that
take place in this degree.

00:35:23.630 --> 00:35:25.640 align:middle line:10%
One of them gets killed.

00:35:25.640 --> 00:35:31.890 align:middle line:10%
Another guy-- I always
struggle with, Zerubbabel?

00:35:31.890 --> 00:35:33.250 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:35:33.250 --> 00:35:35.320 align:middle line:84%
Discovers the secret
vault. He wasn't

00:35:35.320 --> 00:35:36.945 align:middle line:90%
supposed to go down there.

00:35:36.945 --> 00:35:41.790 align:middle line:10%
And most of us know that there's
a lot of stuff in the Ark.

00:35:41.790 --> 00:35:43.430 align:middle line:10%
There isn't just one
thing in the Ark,

00:35:43.430 --> 00:35:45.290 align:middle line:10%
at least according
to our tradition.

00:35:45.290 --> 00:35:47.440 align:middle line:10%
But one of the things most
people know about that's

00:35:47.440 --> 00:35:48.640 align:middle line:10%
in the Ark is what?

00:35:48.640 --> 00:35:51.510 align:middle line:90%
Ten Commandments, right?

00:35:51.510 --> 00:35:54.280 align:middle line:84%
And men, red from
blood and death.

00:35:54.280 --> 00:35:58.610 align:middle line:84%
And there's a copy down below
in the secret vault, right?

00:35:58.610 --> 00:36:01.050 align:middle line:90%
So there's another copy.

00:36:01.050 --> 00:36:02.370 align:middle line:90%
Another 10.

00:36:02.370 --> 00:36:04.570 align:middle line:10%
And 14 is important.

00:36:04.570 --> 00:36:07.140 align:middle line:10%
It has to do with the
Isis Osiris mysteries

00:36:07.140 --> 00:36:08.560 align:middle line:10%
that Tim talked about.

00:36:08.560 --> 00:36:14.620 align:middle line:84%
How Osiris went looking to
visit his brother, his uncle,

00:36:14.620 --> 00:36:18.090 align:middle line:84%
and he was killed,
cut up into 14 pieces.

00:36:18.090 --> 00:36:22.320 align:middle line:84%
And Isis flies over
and collects 13 pieces

00:36:22.320 --> 00:36:24.460 align:middle line:84%
because she's the
feminine, right?

00:36:24.460 --> 00:36:27.580 align:middle line:84%
And she finds everything
except his phallus.

00:36:27.580 --> 00:36:32.010 align:middle line:84%
And so she crafts one either
out of beeswax or gold,

00:36:32.010 --> 00:36:35.050 align:middle line:84%
and she impregnates
herself, Horus is born,

00:36:35.050 --> 00:36:37.390 align:middle line:84%
and then the whole
story starts over again

00:36:37.390 --> 00:36:42.850 align:middle line:84%
because all it is an allegorical
story about life on the planet.

00:36:42.850 --> 00:36:45.250 align:middle line:10%
Birth in the spring,
death in the fall,

00:36:45.250 --> 00:36:47.720 align:middle line:10%
resurrection on the
winter solstice.

00:36:47.720 --> 00:36:48.520 align:middle line:10%
New life, right?

00:36:48.520 --> 00:36:51.922 align:middle line:10%
Where have we seen
that story before?

00:36:51.922 --> 00:36:53.220 align:middle line:90%
Oh, yeah.

00:36:53.220 --> 00:36:55.530 align:middle line:90%
At church.

00:36:55.530 --> 00:37:00.790 align:middle line:84%
In any case, so this
was a revelation that,

00:37:00.790 --> 00:37:03.430 align:middle line:84%
to my knowledge, I'm the
first person to pick up.

00:37:03.430 --> 00:37:06.990 align:middle line:10%
But what it tells us is that
the carver of the Runestone

00:37:06.990 --> 00:37:13.380 align:middle line:10%
was deeply initiated in
the Enochian mysteries.

00:37:13.380 --> 00:37:17.070 align:middle line:10%
One of the things it says in the
ritual book is that their hours

00:37:17.070 --> 00:37:21.180 align:middle line:10%
of labor were from 9:00 at night
until midnight when all prying

00:37:21.180 --> 00:37:22.740 align:middle line:10%
eyes are closed and sleep.

00:37:22.740 --> 00:37:25.840 align:middle line:10%
Well, nine plus what is 12?

00:37:25.840 --> 00:37:27.010 align:middle line:90%
Three, right?

00:37:27.010 --> 00:37:30.580 align:middle line:84%
Nine lines of text on the
face, three on the side,

00:37:30.580 --> 00:37:32.030 align:middle line:90%
for a total of 12.

00:37:32.030 --> 00:37:35.210 align:middle line:84%
Probably another
coincidence, right?

00:37:35.210 --> 00:37:38.330 align:middle line:84%
So anyway, I started
really digging into this.

00:37:38.330 --> 00:37:42.680 align:middle line:84%
And I started looking at
different spiritual avenues

00:37:42.680 --> 00:37:44.350 align:middle line:90%
of pursuit.

00:37:44.350 --> 00:37:49.810 align:middle line:84%
And I look carefully at the
Kabbalah, Hebrew mysticism.

00:37:49.810 --> 00:37:52.100 align:middle line:84%
And specifically
the Tree of Life,

00:37:52.100 --> 00:37:55.660 align:middle line:84%
which is very interesting
because it's comprised of 10

00:37:55.660 --> 00:38:02.350 align:middle line:84%
spheres that connect
to create 22 paths that

00:38:02.350 --> 00:38:04.100 align:middle line:90%
rest on three pillars.

00:38:04.100 --> 00:38:06.760 align:middle line:84%
There's a very important
aspect of the number three

00:38:06.760 --> 00:38:08.440 align:middle line:90%
that occurs on the Runestone.

00:38:08.440 --> 00:38:12.790 align:middle line:84%
For a total of 32 emanations
of deity with the hidden 11th

00:38:12.790 --> 00:38:17.470 align:middle line:84%
sphere that creates a
33rd hidden emanation.

00:38:17.470 --> 00:38:20.410 align:middle line:90%
Does that sound familiar at all?

00:38:20.410 --> 00:38:23.510 align:middle line:84%
So just look at the
Runestone for fun, right?

00:38:23.510 --> 00:38:26.480 align:middle line:90%
Eight plus 22 is what?

00:38:26.480 --> 00:38:27.650 align:middle line:10%
30, right?

00:38:27.650 --> 00:38:33.610 align:middle line:10%
Plus 2 shelters, 1
day's journey north.

00:38:33.610 --> 00:38:35.500 align:middle line:10%
Probably another coincidence.

00:38:35.500 --> 00:38:38.320 align:middle line:10%
So at the end of the
day, you can look at it

00:38:38.320 --> 00:38:40.860 align:middle line:10%
from a number of
different angles.

00:38:40.860 --> 00:38:43.800 align:middle line:84%
And I think all of us
at one point in our life

00:38:43.800 --> 00:38:47.140 align:middle line:84%
want to examine those
big questions in life.

00:38:47.140 --> 00:38:49.200 align:middle line:90%
Is there a God?

00:38:49.200 --> 00:38:50.950 align:middle line:90%
What happens when I die?

00:38:50.950 --> 00:38:52.526 align:middle line:90%
And so on, right?

00:38:52.526 --> 00:38:54.900 align:middle line:84%
And there's all kinds of
different ways to do it.

00:38:54.900 --> 00:38:56.880 align:middle line:84%
Some people do it through
organized religion.

00:38:56.880 --> 00:39:01.010 align:middle line:84%
Some people do it on their own
through, some spiritual pursuit

00:39:01.010 --> 00:39:01.830 align:middle line:90%
and study.

00:39:01.830 --> 00:39:05.690 align:middle line:84%
But at the end of the day, what
usually happens to people is it

00:39:05.690 --> 00:39:08.670 align:middle line:90%
all comes back to what?

00:39:08.670 --> 00:39:11.250 align:middle line:90%
You, right?

00:39:11.250 --> 00:39:13.480 align:middle line:90%
So I looked at that.

00:39:13.480 --> 00:39:15.750 align:middle line:90%
So let me ask you this.

00:39:15.750 --> 00:39:19.675 align:middle line:84%
Do you know how many bones you
have in your spinal column?

00:39:19.675 --> 00:39:22.360 align:middle line:90%


00:39:22.360 --> 00:39:23.160 align:middle line:90%
33.

00:39:23.160 --> 00:39:26.220 align:middle line:90%


00:39:26.220 --> 00:39:28.080 align:middle line:90%
Here's the cool part.

00:39:28.080 --> 00:39:31.680 align:middle line:84%
Do you know how many bones
you have in your skull?

00:39:31.680 --> 00:39:39.930 align:middle line:84%
Eight in your cranium, 14 in
your face, for a total of what?

00:39:39.930 --> 00:39:41.770 align:middle line:90%
22.

00:39:41.770 --> 00:39:42.985 align:middle line:90%
This is kind of cool.

00:39:42.985 --> 00:39:46.600 align:middle line:84%
You know how many hooked X's
there are in the Runestone

00:39:46.600 --> 00:39:48.540 align:middle line:90%
inscription?

00:39:48.540 --> 00:39:51.070 align:middle line:90%
22.

00:39:51.070 --> 00:39:55.770 align:middle line:84%
And there's 14
individual numbers.

00:39:55.770 --> 00:39:59.430 align:middle line:84%
There are 10 strange W runes
that the scholars struggled

00:39:59.430 --> 00:40:03.250 align:middle line:84%
with, and there eight
strange U runes there,

00:40:03.250 --> 00:40:05.160 align:middle line:84%
all confirmed within
the inscription.

00:40:05.160 --> 00:40:09.640 align:middle line:84%
There is so much complexity
within this inscription.

00:40:09.640 --> 00:40:14.050 align:middle line:84%
And according to the Wikipedia,
which is the world's resource,

00:40:14.050 --> 00:40:14.850 align:middle line:90%
right?

00:40:14.850 --> 00:40:18.690 align:middle line:84%
This immigrant farmer was
the one that carved this.

00:40:18.690 --> 00:40:19.990 align:middle line:90%
It's ridiculous.

00:40:19.990 --> 00:40:24.540 align:middle line:84%
Anyway, Kensington Runestone
was carved by the Templars.

00:40:24.540 --> 00:40:28.870 align:middle line:84%
It was placed as a land claim
at the Continental Divide.

00:40:28.870 --> 00:40:31.780 align:middle line:84%
And back in the 14th
century, both the French,

00:40:31.780 --> 00:40:34.220 align:middle line:84%
the Templars headquarters
was in Paris, France,

00:40:34.220 --> 00:40:36.910 align:middle line:84%
and the Dutch had a land claim
practice where if you could

00:40:36.910 --> 00:40:39.580 align:middle line:84%
prove you navigated the
headwaters of a river system,

00:40:39.580 --> 00:40:41.830 align:middle line:84%
and placed a land claim
stone in the ground,

00:40:41.830 --> 00:40:44.360 align:middle line:84%
and a tin plaque in the
tree for redundancy,

00:40:44.360 --> 00:40:47.440 align:middle line:84%
you could lay claim to the
entire river system and all

00:40:47.440 --> 00:40:49.240 align:middle line:90%
the land associated with it.

00:40:49.240 --> 00:40:51.650 align:middle line:84%
So theoretically, with
the Runestone was placed,

00:40:51.650 --> 00:40:54.820 align:middle line:84%
and again, nobody else has ever
talked about this because logic

00:40:54.820 --> 00:40:58.430 align:middle line:84%
tells you if they put
it here in Kensington,

00:40:58.430 --> 00:41:00.290 align:middle line:90%
they put it there for a reason.

00:41:00.290 --> 00:41:03.050 align:middle line:84%
They didn't just do this
stuff willy nilly, right?

00:41:03.050 --> 00:41:06.770 align:middle line:10%
Well, theoretically, at
Kensington, Minnesota,

00:41:06.770 --> 00:41:09.580 align:middle line:10%
you could lay claim to
the Red River, Hudson Bay

00:41:09.580 --> 00:41:14.590 align:middle line:10%
watershed to the north and the
Mississippi Missouri watershed

00:41:14.590 --> 00:41:15.890 align:middle line:10%
all the way down to the gulf.

00:41:15.890 --> 00:41:18.590 align:middle line:84%
That's about half
the continent, OK?

00:41:18.590 --> 00:41:20.570 align:middle line:84%
Now we're starting
to cook with gas.

00:41:20.570 --> 00:41:22.300 align:middle line:84%
But the Runestone
inscription says

00:41:22.300 --> 00:41:25.150 align:middle line:84%
from Vinland, which is the
northeast coast of North

00:41:25.150 --> 00:41:27.970 align:middle line:90%
America, far to the west.

00:41:27.970 --> 00:41:31.820 align:middle line:84%
That could be interpreted as
the entire continent I think.

00:41:31.820 --> 00:41:35.810 align:middle line:10%
So that's its purpose, and
the Templars put it there.

00:41:35.810 --> 00:41:38.070 align:middle line:84%
And we'll get to
why they did that.

00:41:38.070 --> 00:41:40.440 align:middle line:84%
Now this is an interesting
stone structure.

00:41:40.440 --> 00:41:42.050 align:middle line:10%
It was also built
by the Templars

00:41:42.050 --> 00:41:45.320 align:middle line:10%
around the same time
as the Runestone.

00:41:45.320 --> 00:41:49.830 align:middle line:10%
It's a round cylinder placed
on eight heavy columns.

00:41:49.830 --> 00:41:53.420 align:middle line:84%
And Janet and I were here
about a couple of years ago,

00:41:53.420 --> 00:41:56.940 align:middle line:84%
and I flew the drone, and
I got this beautiful shot.

00:41:56.940 --> 00:41:59.870 align:middle line:84%
But you will see that
there's a bunch of windows

00:41:59.870 --> 00:42:02.630 align:middle line:84%
on different quadrants
of the tower,

00:42:02.630 --> 00:42:05.780 align:middle line:84%
and there's actually smaller
windows up at the top.

00:42:05.780 --> 00:42:09.900 align:middle line:84%
And what they do is they
capture astronomical alignments.

00:42:09.900 --> 00:42:11.730 align:middle line:90%
It's like Gobekli Tepe.

00:42:11.730 --> 00:42:15.180 align:middle line:84%
It's an observatory
in one structure.

00:42:15.180 --> 00:42:20.090 align:middle line:84%
Now these are Knights
Templar, 2-story round church

00:42:20.090 --> 00:42:21.620 align:middle line:90%
architecture.

00:42:21.620 --> 00:42:23.550 align:middle line:90%
This is in Cambridge, England.

00:42:23.550 --> 00:42:26.390 align:middle line:84%
If you take this first
story ambulatory off,

00:42:26.390 --> 00:42:28.130 align:middle line:90%
it's the Newport Tower exactly.

00:42:28.130 --> 00:42:29.780 align:middle line:84%
There's eight
round heavy columns

00:42:29.780 --> 00:42:32.990 align:middle line:84%
with round Romanesque
arches in between.

00:42:32.990 --> 00:42:34.880 align:middle line:90%
This is in Tomar.

00:42:34.880 --> 00:42:37.260 align:middle line:84%
Now this one isn't
round at the top,

00:42:37.260 --> 00:42:40.110 align:middle line:84%
but it's octagonal with
eight heavy columns.

00:42:40.110 --> 00:42:44.760 align:middle line:84%
And it's illuminated with gold,
and it's absolutely stunning.

00:42:44.760 --> 00:42:48.060 align:middle line:84%
The first time we ever saw it,
we literally fell to our knees.

00:42:48.060 --> 00:42:49.410 align:middle line:90%
It was just incredible.

00:42:49.410 --> 00:42:54.640 align:middle line:84%
So this architecture
is spot on the same.

00:42:54.640 --> 00:42:57.980 align:middle line:10%
As I said, there's all kinds
of astronomical alignments,

00:42:57.980 --> 00:43:01.030 align:middle line:10%
including something that's
fantastic that happens

00:43:01.030 --> 00:43:05.210 align:middle line:10%
on the winter solstice,
which is December 21st,

00:43:05.210 --> 00:43:07.690 align:middle line:10%
which also happens
to be my birthday,

00:43:07.690 --> 00:43:10.310 align:middle line:10%
or as Janet likes to
say, the shortest,

00:43:10.310 --> 00:43:13.030 align:middle line:10%
darkest day of the year.

00:43:13.030 --> 00:43:14.250 align:middle line:90%
Thank you for that.

00:43:14.250 --> 00:43:19.860 align:middle line:84%
Anyway, so something
happened in 2007,

00:43:19.860 --> 00:43:22.260 align:middle line:84%
where a local person
took a picture,

00:43:22.260 --> 00:43:26.010 align:middle line:84%
and was giving a presentation,
and just showing his pictures.

00:43:26.010 --> 00:43:28.950 align:middle line:84%
And he showed a picture of
a light box illuminating

00:43:28.950 --> 00:43:31.970 align:middle line:84%
this egg-shaped keystone
in the Newport Tower.

00:43:31.970 --> 00:43:32.770 align:middle line:90%
I went, oh, my god.

00:43:32.770 --> 00:43:35.000 align:middle line:90%
I know what that is.

00:43:35.000 --> 00:43:39.420 align:middle line:84%
And so I went there
on December 21st,

00:43:39.420 --> 00:43:43.880 align:middle line:84%
and I captured these pictures
of the south window creating

00:43:43.880 --> 00:43:46.130 align:middle line:90%
a lightbox.

00:43:46.130 --> 00:43:48.920 align:middle line:84%
That slowly but
surely as the sun

00:43:48.920 --> 00:43:52.770 align:middle line:84%
rises on the morning
of the winter solstice,

00:43:52.770 --> 00:43:56.360 align:middle line:84%
that lightbox moves
down, and it frames out

00:43:56.360 --> 00:44:01.250 align:middle line:84%
the egg, the only true keystone
on the inside of this tower,

00:44:01.250 --> 00:44:03.710 align:middle line:84%
at exactly 9 o'clock
in the morning, which

00:44:03.710 --> 00:44:07.520 align:middle line:84%
happens to be an important time
of medieval monastic prayer

00:44:07.520 --> 00:44:10.610 align:middle line:84%
to those Cistercian
monks and the Templars.

00:44:10.610 --> 00:44:14.300 align:middle line:84%
Interestingly enough, when
we publish this several years

00:44:14.300 --> 00:44:17.270 align:middle line:84%
later, somebody put a GoPro at
the base of one of the columns,

00:44:17.270 --> 00:44:18.650 align:middle line:90%
looking up at the egg.

00:44:18.650 --> 00:44:23.370 align:middle line:84%
And on May 1st,
which is Beltane,

00:44:23.370 --> 00:44:29.180 align:middle line:84%
a very important Celtic holiday,
the east window illuminates it

00:44:29.180 --> 00:44:30.770 align:middle line:90%
as well.

00:44:30.770 --> 00:44:32.560 align:middle line:90%
You can't make this stuff up.

00:44:32.560 --> 00:44:36.950 align:middle line:84%
You know what Wikipedia
says this thing is?

00:44:36.950 --> 00:44:38.780 align:middle line:90%
A windmill.

00:44:38.780 --> 00:44:40.530 align:middle line:90%
This is such nonsense.

00:44:40.530 --> 00:44:42.600 align:middle line:84%
It's not even round
for Christ's sake.

00:44:42.600 --> 00:44:43.660 align:middle line:90%
Give me a break.

00:44:43.660 --> 00:44:47.070 align:middle line:84%
They don't want this
thing to be true.

00:44:47.070 --> 00:44:53.140 align:middle line:84%
Now when I was out
there in 2007 by myself,

00:44:53.140 --> 00:44:57.060 align:middle line:84%
I walked around to the
outside of this archway.

00:44:57.060 --> 00:44:59.670 align:middle line:84%
And I looked up--
oh, by the way,

00:44:59.670 --> 00:45:03.210 align:middle line:84%
look at the
dimensions of the egg.

00:45:03.210 --> 00:45:07.150 align:middle line:84%
Exactly one megalithic
yard when you add them up.

00:45:07.150 --> 00:45:10.470 align:middle line:90%
Must be another coincidence.

00:45:10.470 --> 00:45:12.900 align:middle line:10%
So I go to the
outside of the tower,

00:45:12.900 --> 00:45:14.970 align:middle line:10%
and I look in the archway.

00:45:14.970 --> 00:45:20.850 align:middle line:10%
Back to back with the egg,
together is this keystone right

00:45:20.850 --> 00:45:21.700 align:middle line:10%
here.

00:45:21.700 --> 00:45:23.320 align:middle line:10%
Royal arch.

00:45:23.320 --> 00:45:24.900 align:middle line:10%
Remember in Tim's
lecture, he talked

00:45:24.900 --> 00:45:28.800 align:middle line:10%
about the Statue of
Liberty holding that tablet

00:45:28.800 --> 00:45:30.910 align:middle line:10%
and the notches at the top?

00:45:30.910 --> 00:45:32.260 align:middle line:90%
It's the notch keystone.

00:45:32.260 --> 00:45:34.080 align:middle line:84%
The reason it's
notched at the top

00:45:34.080 --> 00:45:37.230 align:middle line:84%
is because the honor of
placing the final keystone

00:45:37.230 --> 00:45:39.850 align:middle line:84%
in a structure by a
medieval stonemason,

00:45:39.850 --> 00:45:43.080 align:middle line:84%
he was given the honor, and
he would notch that and then

00:45:43.080 --> 00:45:45.900 align:middle line:84%
put it in there, and he
would put his masons mark

00:45:45.900 --> 00:45:47.800 align:middle line:90%
on that stone.

00:45:47.800 --> 00:45:49.577 align:middle line:84%
And I didn't know
this at the time.

00:45:49.577 --> 00:45:51.160 align:middle line:10%
And I'm looking at
this thing, and I'm

00:45:51.160 --> 00:45:55.630 align:middle line:10%
seeing these notches and
this round red granite orb.

00:45:55.630 --> 00:45:59.550 align:middle line:10%
And I'm looking at it, and I'm
like, what's up with these?

00:45:59.550 --> 00:46:00.350 align:middle line:10%
No, I did.

00:46:00.350 --> 00:46:01.960 align:middle line:10%
I was talking to it seriously.

00:46:01.960 --> 00:46:05.610 align:middle line:10%
And I said, what
are you pointing to?

00:46:05.610 --> 00:46:10.260 align:middle line:84%
And I look to the west,
and it hit me like that.

00:46:10.260 --> 00:46:11.470 align:middle line:10%
I'm not making this up.

00:46:11.470 --> 00:46:14.200 align:middle line:84%
And I went on Google Earth,
and I did the whole stretch.

00:46:14.200 --> 00:46:15.190 align:middle line:90%
I did it all.

00:46:15.190 --> 00:46:17.100 align:middle line:90%
And watch this.

00:46:17.100 --> 00:46:21.540 align:middle line:84%
So if you draw a line from
the center of the tower

00:46:21.540 --> 00:46:23.590 align:middle line:90%
through those two archways.

00:46:23.590 --> 00:46:29.840 align:middle line:10%
And I want to point out that it
is not centered in the archway.

00:46:29.840 --> 00:46:34.000 align:middle line:84%
It's actually 2 and 1/2 degrees
off on a 360-degree circle.

00:46:34.000 --> 00:46:35.680 align:middle line:90%
It's not centered.

00:46:35.680 --> 00:46:39.560 align:middle line:84%
No self-respecting medieval
stonemason would do that.

00:46:39.560 --> 00:46:41.210 align:middle line:90%
So what does that tell you?

00:46:41.210 --> 00:46:43.060 align:middle line:90%
They did it for a reason, right?

00:46:43.060 --> 00:46:46.510 align:middle line:84%
So if you draw a line from
the center of the tower

00:46:46.510 --> 00:46:50.860 align:middle line:84%
through those two keystones, the
only keystones in that tower,

00:46:50.860 --> 00:46:55.100 align:middle line:84%
and you extend that line into
space, guess where it goes?

00:46:55.100 --> 00:46:57.620 align:middle line:90%


00:46:57.620 --> 00:47:03.010 align:middle line:84%
Kensington, Minnesota
to the Runestone.

00:47:03.010 --> 00:47:03.810 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:47:03.810 --> 00:47:06.496 align:middle line:90%
You cannot make that up, right?

00:47:06.496 --> 00:47:12.510 align:middle line:84%
So I published this in
my Hooked X book in 2009.

00:47:12.510 --> 00:47:14.340 align:middle line:84%
And I've already told
you a lot of people

00:47:14.340 --> 00:47:16.650 align:middle line:84%
out that don't like me,
and they sure as hell

00:47:16.650 --> 00:47:19.030 align:middle line:90%
don't like this research.

00:47:19.030 --> 00:47:24.910 align:middle line:84%
Do you think, if somebody could
have proven me wrong by now,

00:47:24.910 --> 00:47:26.690 align:middle line:84%
that I wouldn't
have heard about it?

00:47:26.690 --> 00:47:29.040 align:middle line:90%
You know what I've heard?

00:47:29.040 --> 00:47:30.660 align:middle line:90%
Crickets.

00:47:30.660 --> 00:47:32.320 align:middle line:90%
Because this is spot on.

00:47:32.320 --> 00:47:34.150 align:middle line:90%
And what does that tell you?

00:47:34.150 --> 00:47:35.890 align:middle line:90%
They're connected.

00:47:35.890 --> 00:47:39.220 align:middle line:84%
Whoever did the Runestone
did the tower and vice versa.

00:47:39.220 --> 00:47:42.800 align:middle line:84%
And there's only one
group that could have.

00:47:42.800 --> 00:47:49.000 align:middle line:90%
