00:00:16.869 --> 00:00:18.160 align:middle line:90%
>> ROBERT PHOENIX: Hello there.

00:00:18.160 --> 00:00:20.540 align:middle line:10%
This is Robert Phoenix, and
welcome to another edition

00:00:20.540 --> 00:00:21.540 align:middle line:10%
of "The Eleventh House."

00:00:21.540 --> 00:00:24.250 align:middle line:10%
And today on this
episode we're going

00:00:24.250 --> 00:00:28.880 align:middle line:10%
to be exploring a slightly
different take on astrology.

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:31.810 align:middle line:84%
It's going to incorporate
astrology, film,

00:00:31.810 --> 00:00:34.470 align:middle line:84%
and what we call quote,
unquote "real life."

00:00:34.470 --> 00:00:37.640 align:middle line:84%
And it's something that I
like to call the cinematrix.

00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:43.350 align:middle line:84%
It's where film, astrology,
symbols, and personalities,

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:48.370 align:middle line:84%
life and death, all converge
into a kind of metamatrix

00:00:48.370 --> 00:00:49.080 align:middle line:90%
experience.

00:00:49.080 --> 00:00:51.940 align:middle line:84%
And we're going to see that
today through, essentially,

00:00:51.940 --> 00:00:56.240 align:middle line:84%
one film and one actor--
well, two films and one actor.

00:00:56.240 --> 00:01:00.050 align:middle line:84%
The films are "The Imaginarium
of Doctor Parnassus"

00:01:00.050 --> 00:01:04.280 align:middle line:84%
and "Batman," and the
actor is Heath Ledger,

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:06.800 align:middle line:84%
of course the late Heath
Ledger, who tragically

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:11.659 align:middle line:84%
died with an overdose of a
cocktail of prescription drugs.

00:01:11.659 --> 00:01:13.950 align:middle line:84%
So one of the reasons we're
doing this, or at least I'm

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:15.920 align:middle line:84%
doing, this show
today is to show

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:20.760 align:middle line:84%
how these areas can overlap
and intersect and have kind

00:01:20.760 --> 00:01:23.400 align:middle line:84%
of a really strange effect
on reality in general.

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:25.930 align:middle line:84%
But we're now at
zero degrees Pisces.

00:01:25.930 --> 00:01:29.550 align:middle line:84%
I'm shooting this with the moon
at the final stages of Libra

00:01:29.550 --> 00:01:31.200 align:middle line:84%
getting ready to
move into Scorpio,

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:33.430 align:middle line:84%
and we're at zero
degrees Pisces.

00:01:33.430 --> 00:01:35.030 align:middle line:90%
And Pisces rules film.

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:36.250 align:middle line:90%
Why does Pisces rule film?

00:01:36.250 --> 00:01:40.760 align:middle line:84%
Well, film is made out of
petroleum-based products.

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:45.060 align:middle line:84%
So film essentially starts as
a liquid, and then it hardens.

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:47.960 align:middle line:84%
And when it becomes
hard, it takes an image

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:49.940 align:middle line:84%
and retains the
image, and then it

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:51.669 align:middle line:90%
gets projected onto a screen.

00:01:51.669 --> 00:01:53.335 align:middle line:84%
One of the interesting
things about film

00:01:53.335 --> 00:01:58.450 align:middle line:84%
as well is, like its analog
counterpart, the 33 RPM

00:01:58.450 --> 00:02:01.370 align:middle line:84%
recording or the
45 RPM recording,

00:02:01.370 --> 00:02:02.610 align:middle line:90%
they are essentially analog.

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:05.250 align:middle line:84%
Now some films are shot
digitally and then transferred

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:09.550 align:middle line:84%
to film, but by and large
film is an analog experience.

00:02:09.550 --> 00:02:12.700 align:middle line:84%
And just like
vinyl or wax, which

00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:15.120 align:middle line:84%
captures the magnetic
band when it's

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:18.800 align:middle line:84%
recorded in an analog
studio using tubes

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:21.570 align:middle line:84%
and the prehistoric technology
of the 20th century,

00:02:21.570 --> 00:02:24.010 align:middle line:90%
film has a similar impact on us.

00:02:24.010 --> 00:02:25.690 align:middle line:90%
It has a soundtrack.

00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:28.690 align:middle line:84%
That soundtrack which runs
right down the side of the film

00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:31.130 align:middle line:84%
actually captures
magnetic resonance,

00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:34.420 align:middle line:84%
and magnetic resonance holds
emotion, which brings us back

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:37.090 align:middle line:84%
to Pisces and the whole
Piscean experience.

00:02:37.090 --> 00:02:39.500 align:middle line:84%
So what's also fascinating
is as we move out

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:42.290 align:middle line:84%
of the Age of Pisces and we
move into the Age of Aquarius,

00:02:42.290 --> 00:02:43.160 align:middle line:90%
we lose all that.

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:44.890 align:middle line:90%
We lose the magnetic resonance.

00:02:44.890 --> 00:02:48.270 align:middle line:84%
We lose the 33 and 1/3 RPM
record, we lose the 45,

00:02:48.270 --> 00:02:50.700 align:middle line:84%
and we lose film, and
we go straight to video,

00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:51.580 align:middle line:90%
and we do digital.

00:02:51.580 --> 00:02:53.870 align:middle line:84%
We go 0's and 1's,
very Aquarian.

00:02:53.870 --> 00:02:56.980 align:middle line:84%
And we get the approximation
or the simulacra

00:02:56.980 --> 00:02:59.060 align:middle line:84%
of the experience, but
what we're not getting

00:02:59.060 --> 00:03:01.585 align:middle line:84%
is we're not getting the
emotional heart of it.

00:03:01.585 --> 00:03:04.570 align:middle line:84%
And that's why film can be such
a moving experience for people,

00:03:04.570 --> 00:03:08.160 align:middle line:84%
especially when it's done from
a purely analog perspective

00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:12.364 align:middle line:84%
and thus kind of echoing back
the Age of Pisces and Neptune.

00:03:12.364 --> 00:03:14.280 align:middle line:84%
So here we are at Neptune
zero degrees Pisces.

00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:15.851 align:middle line:84%
We're going to be
talking about film.

00:03:15.851 --> 00:03:17.350 align:middle line:84%
So why don't we
jump right into this

00:03:17.350 --> 00:03:22.240 align:middle line:84%
now and move into
the-- here we go--

00:03:22.240 --> 00:03:25.290 align:middle line:84%
the introduction
of our show today.

00:03:25.290 --> 00:03:26.995 align:middle line:84%
This is a trailer
from "The Imaginarium

00:03:26.995 --> 00:03:28.260 align:middle line:90%
of Doctor Parnassus."

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:31.605 align:middle line:10%
It comes at you pretty quickly,
and it's a feast for the eyes,

00:03:31.605 --> 00:03:32.290 align:middle line:10%
but here we go.

00:03:32.290 --> 00:03:33.775 align:middle line:10%

[END VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:04:24.930 --> 00:04:27.096 align:middle line:84%
>> ROBERT PHOENIX: So what
you just saw was about 90

00:04:27.096 --> 00:04:31.500 align:middle line:84%
seconds' worth of a deeply
layered and fairly complex film

00:04:31.500 --> 00:04:34.660 align:middle line:84%
by Terry Gilliam, the
director of "Time Bandits,"

00:04:34.660 --> 00:04:37.790 align:middle line:84%
"Baron von Munchausen," and, of
course, the classic "Brazil."

00:04:37.790 --> 00:04:41.170 align:middle line:84%
And I think this might have
been Terry Gilliam's last film.

00:04:41.170 --> 00:04:43.480 align:middle line:84%
He hasn't really done
anything since then.

00:04:43.480 --> 00:04:46.100 align:middle line:84%
And in some ways,
the film is almost

00:04:46.100 --> 00:04:49.150 align:middle line:84%
akin to what John Carpenter
did with "They Live."

00:04:49.150 --> 00:04:51.747 align:middle line:84%
There was a bit of professional
suicide in this film,

00:04:51.747 --> 00:04:53.080 align:middle line:90%
and we're going to get into why.

00:04:53.080 --> 00:04:55.960 align:middle line:84%
I think it's actually a
fairly important film that

00:04:55.960 --> 00:04:58.480 align:middle line:84%
came and went, and it's
important on a number

00:04:58.480 --> 00:05:00.130 align:middle line:90%
of different levels.

00:05:00.130 --> 00:05:03.330 align:middle line:84%
So the whole idea
with Doctor Parnassus,

00:05:03.330 --> 00:05:05.052 align:middle line:84%
who's played by
Christopher Plummer,

00:05:05.052 --> 00:05:07.390 align:middle line:90%
is that he's like a yogi.

00:05:07.390 --> 00:05:11.070 align:middle line:84%
He's a Tibetan yogi, but he's
not an ordinary Tibetan yogi.

00:05:11.070 --> 00:05:17.780 align:middle line:84%
He actually is the Tibetan
yogi with his yogi compatriots,

00:05:17.780 --> 00:05:20.877 align:middle line:84%
his assistants that dream
the world into being.

00:05:20.877 --> 00:05:21.710 align:middle line:90%
That's what they do.

00:05:21.710 --> 00:05:24.310 align:middle line:84%
They're in the furthest
reaches of Tibet,

00:05:24.310 --> 00:05:26.630 align:middle line:84%
and they are dreaming
the world into being.

00:05:26.630 --> 00:05:29.760 align:middle line:84%
And one day a terrific
and malevolent force

00:05:29.760 --> 00:05:33.010 align:middle line:84%
descends upon them, and
that force is Tom Waits,

00:05:33.010 --> 00:05:34.170 align:middle line:90%
and he plays the Devil.

00:05:34.170 --> 00:05:37.830 align:middle line:84%
And what he does is he makes a
deal with Christopher Plummer's

00:05:37.830 --> 00:05:40.260 align:middle line:84%
character, Doctor
Parnassus, and it's

00:05:40.260 --> 00:05:46.960 align:middle line:84%
whoever can get to saving or
corrupting five souls first,

00:05:46.960 --> 00:05:49.350 align:middle line:84%
they are the ones
that are victorious.

00:05:49.350 --> 00:05:51.700 align:middle line:84%
Now if Tom Waits,
the Devil, does that,

00:05:51.700 --> 00:05:58.690 align:middle line:84%
then he gets Christopher
Plummer's daughter Valentina

00:05:58.690 --> 00:05:59.960 align:middle line:90%
at the age of 16.

00:05:59.960 --> 00:06:02.520 align:middle line:84%
Now Christopher Plummer
has to stop him somehow,

00:06:02.520 --> 00:06:06.080 align:middle line:84%
so he creates the Imaginarium
of Doctor Parnassus.

00:06:06.080 --> 00:06:07.490 align:middle line:90%
He leaves Tibet.

00:06:07.490 --> 00:06:10.240 align:middle line:84%
He leaves the center of the
world, the dreaming place

00:06:10.240 --> 00:06:13.255 align:middle line:84%
of the world, and he has
a tawdry little show,

00:06:13.255 --> 00:06:16.200 align:middle line:84%
a tawdry little sideshow,
a little circus where

00:06:16.200 --> 00:06:18.330 align:middle line:84%
he goes from town
to town and he's

00:06:18.330 --> 00:06:22.230 align:middle line:84%
able to take people through
a portal, through a mirror,

00:06:22.230 --> 00:06:24.620 align:middle line:84%
and he gets them
to face themselves.

00:06:24.620 --> 00:06:26.890 align:middle line:84%
And the whole idea
with this is that they

00:06:26.890 --> 00:06:29.532 align:middle line:84%
can experience some
kind of redemption.

00:06:29.532 --> 00:06:30.990 align:middle line:84%
And the reason I
think that this is

00:06:30.990 --> 00:06:33.260 align:middle line:84%
important on a
spiritual level is

00:06:33.260 --> 00:06:35.510 align:middle line:84%
the times that we're living
in, the tenor of the times

00:06:35.510 --> 00:06:36.385 align:middle line:90%
that we're living in.

00:06:36.385 --> 00:06:40.480 align:middle line:84%
Because we are living in Neptune
in Pisces and Chiron in Pisces.

00:06:40.480 --> 00:06:42.770 align:middle line:84%
And what is happening
with Neptune and Chiron

00:06:42.770 --> 00:06:44.800 align:middle line:84%
in Pisces on an
inner level-- again,

00:06:44.800 --> 00:06:46.870 align:middle line:84%
we're talking film
here-- we're getting

00:06:46.870 --> 00:06:51.210 align:middle line:84%
to have the review of our own
life's film, our own cinema

00:06:51.210 --> 00:06:54.550 align:middle line:84%
as we go through these really
intense and interesting times

00:06:54.550 --> 00:06:56.470 align:middle line:90%
of being here on the planet.

00:06:56.470 --> 00:06:59.520 align:middle line:84%
So what's happening in
the movie, as people face

00:06:59.520 --> 00:07:04.130 align:middle line:84%
themselves and their temptations
inside Parnassus' Imaginarium,

00:07:04.130 --> 00:07:06.670 align:middle line:84%
we're actually getting to
experience in our own lives

00:07:06.670 --> 00:07:07.314 align:middle line:90%
as well.

00:07:07.314 --> 00:07:09.230 align:middle line:84%
So this is why I think
it's an important film.

00:07:09.230 --> 00:07:11.510 align:middle line:84%
I think Terry Gilliam was
tapping into something.

00:07:11.510 --> 00:07:14.210 align:middle line:84%
He was tapping into
something at a soul level.

00:07:14.210 --> 00:07:16.630 align:middle line:84%
He was tapping into
something at an Akashic level

00:07:16.630 --> 00:07:18.110 align:middle line:90%
and also on a political level.

00:07:18.110 --> 00:07:19.680 align:middle line:84%
We're going to get
into a lot of that

00:07:19.680 --> 00:07:22.045 align:middle line:84%
over the course of
the next few slides.

00:07:22.045 --> 00:07:22.670 align:middle line:90%
So here we are.

00:07:22.670 --> 00:07:25.050 align:middle line:84%
This is the Imaginarium
of Doctor Parnassus,

00:07:25.050 --> 00:07:28.210 align:middle line:84%
and this is the synopsis of
the film, classic morality

00:07:28.210 --> 00:07:30.880 align:middle line:84%
tale of good and evil,
but the good and evil

00:07:30.880 --> 00:07:33.090 align:middle line:90%
exist in men and women alike.

00:07:33.090 --> 00:07:36.290 align:middle line:84%
Doctor Parnassus is an ancient
dreamer who can provide

00:07:36.290 --> 00:07:38.910 align:middle line:84%
the opportunity for a
person to save their soul,

00:07:38.910 --> 00:07:41.300 align:middle line:84%
but the irony is is that
he cannot save his own.

00:07:41.300 --> 00:07:46.540 align:middle line:84%
And in fact, he actually needs
Heath Ledger and his character

00:07:46.540 --> 00:07:47.960 align:middle line:90%
to help him save his own soul.

00:07:47.960 --> 00:07:50.150 align:middle line:84%
Now what's interesting
about this is this

00:07:50.150 --> 00:07:51.815 align:middle line:90%
is Heath Ledger's last film.

00:07:51.815 --> 00:07:54.650 align:middle line:84%
He had finished "Batman"
and playing the Joker prior

00:07:54.650 --> 00:07:57.470 align:middle line:84%
to this, but he actually
died during production.

00:07:57.470 --> 00:07:59.720 align:middle line:84%
So his role at the
end of the film

00:07:59.720 --> 00:08:03.860 align:middle line:84%
had to be played by three
separate actors, Johnny Depp,

00:08:03.860 --> 00:08:05.930 align:middle line:90%
Colin Farrell, and Jude Law.

00:08:05.930 --> 00:08:10.560 align:middle line:84%
And the way that Terry
Gilliam shot those scenes

00:08:10.560 --> 00:08:13.300 align:middle line:84%
is that Heath Ledger's
character became

00:08:13.300 --> 00:08:15.540 align:middle line:84%
somebody else inside
the Imaginarium.

00:08:15.540 --> 00:08:17.400 align:middle line:84%
It's probably one of
the few films that

00:08:17.400 --> 00:08:19.560 align:middle line:84%
could have afforded
him the opportunity

00:08:19.560 --> 00:08:22.780 align:middle line:84%
to cast three separate
actors to finish the role.

00:08:22.780 --> 00:08:25.460 align:middle line:84%
So the main characters and
their signs-- of course this

00:08:25.460 --> 00:08:28.220 align:middle line:84%
is an astrological TV
show or internet show.

00:08:28.220 --> 00:08:30.600 align:middle line:10%
We have to take that into
account-- Christopher Plummer,

00:08:30.600 --> 00:08:34.277 align:middle line:10%
Sagittarius, Tom
Waits, Sagittarius.

00:08:34.277 --> 00:08:36.610 align:middle line:84%
And what's fascinating about
Christopher Plummer and Tom

00:08:36.610 --> 00:08:38.870 align:middle line:84%
Waits as being
Sagittarius is that they

00:08:38.870 --> 00:08:41.919 align:middle line:90%
both play good and evil.

00:08:41.919 --> 00:08:47.270 align:middle line:84%
Ultimately, Doctor Parnassus
is good, and Tom Waits is evil.

00:08:47.270 --> 00:08:51.430 align:middle line:84%
But Parnassus cannot experience
his goodness or his redemption

00:08:51.430 --> 00:08:52.780 align:middle line:90%
without Tom Waits.

00:08:52.780 --> 00:08:54.270 align:middle line:90%
They need each other.

00:08:54.270 --> 00:08:57.200 align:middle line:84%
And Tom Waits, his
character, the Devil,

00:08:57.200 --> 00:09:00.500 align:middle line:84%
needs Parnassus, because
he needs somebody

00:09:00.500 --> 00:09:02.900 align:middle line:84%
to have a challenge with,
to have a contrast with.

00:09:02.900 --> 00:09:07.650 align:middle line:84%
He needs the irony and
the paradox of good versus

00:09:07.650 --> 00:09:10.870 align:middle line:90%
evil in order to exist.

00:09:10.870 --> 00:09:12.630 align:middle line:10%
So they're both
Sagittarius, so they

00:09:12.630 --> 00:09:14.670 align:middle line:10%
have this mirror
effect going on.

00:09:14.670 --> 00:09:16.890 align:middle line:10%
On the other side,
we have Johnny Depp

00:09:16.890 --> 00:09:18.110 align:middle line:10%
and we have Colin Farrell.

00:09:18.110 --> 00:09:19.540 align:middle line:90%
They're both Geminis.

00:09:19.540 --> 00:09:22.240 align:middle line:84%
And so when this
movie opened-- and it

00:09:22.240 --> 00:09:26.590 align:middle line:84%
opened on the 11th of
October, 2009-- the ascendant

00:09:26.590 --> 00:09:28.570 align:middle line:84%
was at the final
degrees of Scorpio.

00:09:28.570 --> 00:09:33.130 align:middle line:84%
Actually, it looks like
it's at 26 Scorpio.

00:09:33.130 --> 00:09:36.020 align:middle line:84%
And then we have the 1st
house is Sagittarius.

00:09:36.020 --> 00:09:40.580 align:middle line:84%
So what that means is that both
Christopher Plummer and Tom

00:09:40.580 --> 00:09:42.990 align:middle line:84%
Waits, their Sun was
in the 1st house.

00:09:42.990 --> 00:09:45.020 align:middle line:84%
Johnny Depp and Colin
Farrell, their Sun

00:09:45.020 --> 00:09:46.780 align:middle line:90%
was in the 7th house in Gemini.

00:09:46.780 --> 00:09:48.260 align:middle line:84%
So we have this
duality going on.

00:09:48.260 --> 00:09:51.157 align:middle line:84%
We have this duality between
two of the main characters

00:09:51.157 --> 00:09:52.740 align:middle line:84%
and two of the
replacement characters,

00:09:52.740 --> 00:09:54.340 align:middle line:84%
although they play large
roles in the film, especially

00:09:54.340 --> 00:09:55.352 align:middle line:90%
Colin Farrell.

00:09:55.352 --> 00:09:56.560 align:middle line:90%
So we have that taking place.

00:09:56.560 --> 00:09:58.340 align:middle line:84%
Heath Ledger, of
course, is an Aries.

00:09:58.340 --> 00:10:02.080 align:middle line:84%
He's born April 4,
so his Aries Sun

00:10:02.080 --> 00:10:04.402 align:middle line:90%
is down here in the 4th house.

00:10:04.402 --> 00:10:08.150 align:middle line:84%
And we're going to look at Heath
Ledger's chart and the opening

00:10:08.150 --> 00:10:10.880 align:middle line:84%
for "Parnassus'"
chart quickly here.

00:10:10.880 --> 00:10:14.630 align:middle line:84%
Then we have two Capricorns,
Verne Troyer and Jude Law.

00:10:14.630 --> 00:10:17.600 align:middle line:84%
They are down here
in the 2nd house.

00:10:17.600 --> 00:10:21.570 align:middle line:84%
And then Lily Cole, who plays
Valentina, she's a Taurus,

00:10:21.570 --> 00:10:24.600 align:middle line:84%
and her Sun is over
here, right here

00:10:24.600 --> 00:10:26.250 align:middle line:84%
at the edge of the
fifth and the six.

00:10:26.250 --> 00:10:28.920 align:middle line:84%
And Andrew Garfield who
plays Anton, he's a Virgo,

00:10:28.920 --> 00:10:33.200 align:middle line:84%
and his Sun would be right
up here near the Midheaven.

00:10:33.200 --> 00:10:37.180 align:middle line:84%
So here's some of the imagery,
the eye candy for "Parnassus."

00:10:37.180 --> 00:10:40.200 align:middle line:84%
Let's get into some
of the other images.

00:10:40.200 --> 00:10:43.410 align:middle line:84%
Now this is Christopher
Plummer as he

00:10:43.410 --> 00:10:46.800 align:middle line:90%
exists in the 20th century.

00:10:46.800 --> 00:10:50.590 align:middle line:84%
This is the current or the
modern version of Parnassus.

00:10:50.590 --> 00:10:54.950 align:middle line:84%
And he actually dreams the
world into being for individuals

00:10:54.950 --> 00:10:58.000 align:middle line:84%
that step through
the Imaginarium.

00:10:58.000 --> 00:11:00.474 align:middle line:84%
Now here's where he meets
Heath Ledger in the film,

00:11:00.474 --> 00:11:02.390 align:middle line:84%
and this is actually a
pretty disturbing scene

00:11:02.390 --> 00:11:04.100 align:middle line:90%
in a lot of ways.

00:11:04.100 --> 00:11:06.630 align:middle line:84%
Now they are
crossing the bridge.

00:11:06.630 --> 00:11:08.020 align:middle line:90%
And it's not just any bridge.

00:11:08.020 --> 00:11:11.060 align:middle line:84%
It's the same bridge
that the banker Roberto

00:11:11.060 --> 00:11:13.800 align:middle line:84%
Calvi, who was part
of the P2 Illuminati,

00:11:13.800 --> 00:11:15.740 align:middle line:90%
was found hanging from as well.

00:11:15.740 --> 00:11:17.520 align:middle line:84%
So Terry Gilliam
has actually chosen

00:11:17.520 --> 00:11:19.080 align:middle line:84%
this bridge for a
reason, and he's

00:11:19.080 --> 00:11:22.500 align:middle line:84%
placed Heath Ledger's
character in the same position.

00:11:22.500 --> 00:11:24.000 align:middle line:84%
And as they're
crossing this bridge,

00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:26.530 align:middle line:84%
it's a stormy night, a
dark and stormy night,

00:11:26.530 --> 00:11:31.300 align:middle line:84%
and Parnassus is in their
carriage being drawn by horses.

00:11:31.300 --> 00:11:34.270 align:middle line:84%
And he's getting drunk, and
he's playing with the tarot.

00:11:34.270 --> 00:11:37.440 align:middle line:84%
And the card that he flips over,
of course, is the Hanged Man.

00:11:37.440 --> 00:11:40.190 align:middle line:84%
But what's interesting about
the Hanged Man in tarot

00:11:40.190 --> 00:11:42.010 align:middle line:84%
and this version
of the Hanged Man--

00:11:42.010 --> 00:11:43.440 align:middle line:90%
they're two different versions.

00:11:43.440 --> 00:11:46.940 align:middle line:84%
In the tarot, the Hanged
Man is hanging by his feet.

00:11:46.940 --> 00:11:48.990 align:middle line:90%
He's suspended upside down.

00:11:48.990 --> 00:11:51.080 align:middle line:84%
And we'll see that
later in the show.

00:11:51.080 --> 00:11:53.589 align:middle line:84%
We'll see that the
end of this episode.

00:11:53.589 --> 00:11:56.130 align:middle line:84%
Hanging by the feet, by the way,
is representative of Pisces,

00:11:56.130 --> 00:11:58.310 align:middle line:90%
because Pisces rules the feet.

00:11:58.310 --> 00:11:59.800 align:middle line:90%
What sign is Heath Ledger?

00:11:59.800 --> 00:12:00.435 align:middle line:90%
He's an Aries.

00:12:00.435 --> 00:12:01.660 align:middle line:90%
And what does Aries rule?

00:12:01.660 --> 00:12:03.474 align:middle line:90%
It rules the head.

00:12:03.474 --> 00:12:05.140 align:middle line:84%
So here we have Heath
Ledger being hung.

00:12:05.140 --> 00:12:09.260 align:middle line:84%
Now how he stays alive is
he has a whistle that he

00:12:09.260 --> 00:12:14.760 align:middle line:84%
has put inside of his throat,
and that whistle is keeping him

00:12:14.760 --> 00:12:18.920 align:middle line:84%
from choking or being
asphyxiated by the cord.

00:12:18.920 --> 00:12:21.470 align:middle line:84%
So they're actually
able to resurrect him

00:12:21.470 --> 00:12:23.440 align:middle line:90%
from his Hanged Man position.

00:12:23.440 --> 00:12:26.470 align:middle line:84%
Now if you look, he
has these symbols,

00:12:26.470 --> 00:12:29.820 align:middle line:84%
these Illuminus symbols
on his forehead.

00:12:29.820 --> 00:12:31.250 align:middle line:90%
So we have the third eye here.

00:12:31.250 --> 00:12:33.300 align:middle line:84%
We have the pyramid here
with another third eye.

00:12:33.300 --> 00:12:37.800 align:middle line:84%
So what Terry Gilliam is
actually trying to portray here

00:12:37.800 --> 00:12:40.240 align:middle line:90%
is that this is a ritual death.

00:12:40.240 --> 00:12:45.100 align:middle line:84%
He's, in some ways, kind
of hiding in plain sight,

00:12:45.100 --> 00:12:49.010 align:middle line:84%
and he's making, again, a
reference to Roberto Calvi

00:12:49.010 --> 00:12:52.130 align:middle line:84%
and his death, the member
of the Illuminati P2.

00:12:52.130 --> 00:12:55.430 align:middle line:84%
Roberto Calvi was getting ready
to blow the lid on the Vatican

00:12:55.430 --> 00:12:59.570 align:middle line:84%
and essentially tell the world
what the Vatican was doing

00:12:59.570 --> 00:13:01.724 align:middle line:84%
with its money, where
it got its money,

00:13:01.724 --> 00:13:04.140 align:middle line:84%
and what it would like to do
with its money in the future.

00:13:04.140 --> 00:13:06.020 align:middle line:90%
However, this happened.

00:13:06.020 --> 00:13:09.480 align:middle line:84%
You can actually see the whistle
here in Heath Ledger's mouth.

00:13:09.480 --> 00:13:13.400 align:middle line:84%
So they pull him off the
rope, and he joins the troupe.

00:13:13.400 --> 00:13:16.000 align:middle line:10%
He becomes a member
of the Imaginarium.

00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:19.500 align:middle line:10%
So I wanted to get into
some of the symbolism here.

00:13:19.500 --> 00:13:21.890 align:middle line:10%
These are the visual
cues of "Parnassus."

00:13:21.890 --> 00:13:23.750 align:middle line:10%
Terry Gilliam isn't shy
when he incorporates

00:13:23.750 --> 00:13:26.690 align:middle line:10%
the black and white duality
motif of free masonry

00:13:26.690 --> 00:13:28.590 align:middle line:10%
as part of their
traveling sideshow.

00:13:28.590 --> 00:13:32.510 align:middle line:10%
He also uses the mirror as
a classic portal technique,

00:13:32.510 --> 00:13:34.840 align:middle line:10%
which he borrows from Jean
Cocteau and his classic film

00:13:34.840 --> 00:13:35.850 align:middle line:10%
"Orpheus."

00:13:35.850 --> 00:13:38.500 align:middle line:10%
So let's just take a look
at this for a second.

00:13:38.500 --> 00:13:41.630 align:middle line:10%
Here we have the black and
white checkerboard duality,

00:13:41.630 --> 00:13:45.920 align:middle line:10%
which you can see in this
picture and in this picture.

00:13:45.920 --> 00:13:48.666 align:middle line:10%
These are Freemasonic interiors.

00:13:48.666 --> 00:13:51.040 align:middle line:10%
So you can see the floor, and
you can see the floor here,

00:13:51.040 --> 00:13:54.380 align:middle line:10%
the black and white,
the chessboard of life.

00:13:54.380 --> 00:13:57.270 align:middle line:10%
Light and dark, good and
evil, right and wrong, it's

00:13:57.270 --> 00:13:59.690 align:middle line:10%
all there, and it's
all being played out

00:13:59.690 --> 00:14:04.160 align:middle line:10%
on the foundation
of these interior,

00:14:04.160 --> 00:14:06.250 align:middle line:10%
for lack of a better
term, ritual scapes.

00:14:06.250 --> 00:14:07.600 align:middle line:10%
Now here's the mirror.

00:14:07.600 --> 00:14:10.170 align:middle line:10%
And the mirror plays
the role of the portal.

00:14:10.170 --> 00:14:12.300 align:middle line:10%
But if you look at
everything-- and here's

00:14:12.300 --> 00:14:15.310 align:middle line:10%
another version of the
Imaginarium here with the Sun.

00:14:15.310 --> 00:14:18.530 align:middle line:10%
This is a symbol of the Sun,
so there's Sun worship as well.

00:14:18.530 --> 00:14:23.570 align:middle line:10%
This is a second Sun-- when
we see this, what we see

00:14:23.570 --> 00:14:25.380 align:middle line:10%
is something quite tacky.

00:14:25.380 --> 00:14:30.700 align:middle line:10%
We see tinsel, and the seams
are showing, and it's tin foil,

00:14:30.700 --> 00:14:34.430 align:middle line:10%
and it's probably
a spray-painted

00:14:34.430 --> 00:14:39.020 align:middle line:10%
brass/golden-gilded frame
for the mirror, right?

00:14:39.020 --> 00:14:40.040 align:middle line:10%
But it looks tacky.

00:14:40.040 --> 00:14:42.700 align:middle line:10%
So what Terry Gilliam is
doing is he's actually

00:14:42.700 --> 00:14:45.080 align:middle line:10%
making a statement,
in some ways,

00:14:45.080 --> 00:14:47.330 align:middle line:10%
about Freemasonry
and Illuminism.

00:14:47.330 --> 00:14:50.180 align:middle line:10%
He, in some ways, is
poking fun at them

00:14:50.180 --> 00:14:53.305 align:middle line:10%
by having it be hauled
around from street corner

00:14:53.305 --> 00:14:55.440 align:middle line:10%
to street corner
and mall to mall.

00:14:55.440 --> 00:14:58.120 align:middle line:10%
Now also what we
have down here--

00:14:58.120 --> 00:14:59.984 align:middle line:10%
it's probably hard
for you to see,

00:14:59.984 --> 00:15:01.650 align:middle line:10%
but it's the one
picture I have, and you

00:15:01.650 --> 00:15:03.460 align:middle line:10%
might have seen it
in the introduction

00:15:03.460 --> 00:15:06.820 align:middle line:10%
of the film-- Heath Ledger
is wearing a Venetian mask.

00:15:06.820 --> 00:15:09.060 align:middle line:10%
This is what they wear at
the Carnival of Venice.

00:15:09.060 --> 00:15:12.290 align:middle line:10%
It's also the same kind
of mask that's being used

00:15:12.290 --> 00:15:15.330 align:middle line:10%
or is used in "Eyes Wide
Shut," the film that

00:15:15.330 --> 00:15:20.735 align:middle line:10%
is made by Stanley Kubrick and
who Jay Weidner has completely

00:15:20.735 --> 00:15:24.430 align:middle line:10%
and classically masterfully
dissected, along with "2001,

00:15:24.430 --> 00:15:25.580 align:middle line:10%
a Space Odyssey."

00:15:25.580 --> 00:15:30.610 align:middle line:10%
So what Terry Gilliam is doing
is he's making a reference.

00:15:30.610 --> 00:15:34.230 align:middle line:10%
He's making a reference with the
Venetian mask and Heath Ledger

00:15:34.230 --> 00:15:37.020 align:middle line:10%
that there is also a
connection to the material

00:15:37.020 --> 00:15:40.110 align:middle line:10%
that Stanley Kubrick was talking
about in "Eyes Wide Shut."

00:15:40.110 --> 00:15:42.570 align:middle line:10%
So these are the
visual cues that

00:15:42.570 --> 00:15:45.900 align:middle line:10%
are connecting the
world of Parnassus

00:15:45.900 --> 00:15:49.180 align:middle line:10%
with the world of Illuminism,
Freemasonry, and magic.

00:15:49.180 --> 00:15:50.300 align:middle line:10%
Here's another one.

00:15:50.300 --> 00:15:55.310 align:middle line:90%
This is the top of his trailer.

00:15:55.310 --> 00:15:57.320 align:middle line:84%
It's actually, it's
a horse and trailer.

00:15:57.320 --> 00:16:01.450 align:middle line:84%
It's almost like a covered wagon
that they haul around London

00:16:01.450 --> 00:16:02.180 align:middle line:90%
together.

00:16:02.180 --> 00:16:06.050 align:middle line:84%
So here we have the all-seeing
eye, the blazing Sun behind it.

00:16:06.050 --> 00:16:09.810 align:middle line:84%
You saw the blazing Sun, or
at least the facsimile of it,

00:16:09.810 --> 00:16:11.000 align:middle line:90%
in the last scene.

00:16:11.000 --> 00:16:15.150 align:middle line:84%
So again, Gilliam is making a
magical and esoteric reference

00:16:15.150 --> 00:16:16.490 align:middle line:90%
to the Illuminati.

00:16:16.490 --> 00:16:19.705 align:middle line:90%


00:16:19.705 --> 00:16:25.745 align:middle line:84%
This is the opening of the
film on the 11th of October.

00:16:25.745 --> 00:16:27.120 align:middle line:84%
I think it's kind
of interesting.

00:16:27.120 --> 00:16:29.580 align:middle line:84%
It's 9/10/11, if
you're going backwards.

00:16:29.580 --> 00:16:31.819 align:middle line:90%
It's 2009, so it's 9, 10, 11.

00:16:31.819 --> 00:16:33.360 align:middle line:84%
So there's some kind
of coding there.

00:16:33.360 --> 00:16:36.350 align:middle line:84%
11:00AM would've been the first
time they would have shown

00:16:36.350 --> 00:16:37.700 align:middle line:90%
the film in London at a matinee.

00:16:37.700 --> 00:16:39.590 align:middle line:84%
It probably would've
opened there,

00:16:39.590 --> 00:16:41.370 align:middle line:84%
because that's where
Terry Gilliam lives.

00:16:41.370 --> 00:16:44.380 align:middle line:84%
So again, here we
have the ascendant.

00:16:44.380 --> 00:16:47.390 align:middle line:84%
What I wanted to show
here is, because we're

00:16:47.390 --> 00:16:50.700 align:middle line:84%
showing this one more
time, is Venus up here near

00:16:50.700 --> 00:16:52.760 align:middle line:90%
Virgo at the Midheaven.

00:16:52.760 --> 00:16:55.400 align:middle line:84%
Now this film was actually
critically acclaimed.

00:16:55.400 --> 00:16:57.901 align:middle line:84%
So when we see Virgo
at the Midheaven,

00:16:57.901 --> 00:16:59.650 align:middle line:84%
the critics would
actually like it, right?

00:16:59.650 --> 00:17:00.640 align:middle line:90%
Because that's Virgo.

00:17:00.640 --> 00:17:02.520 align:middle line:90%
That's what Virgo does.

00:17:02.520 --> 00:17:03.790 align:middle line:90%
It criticizes it.

00:17:03.790 --> 00:17:07.710 align:middle line:84%
It gets in and editorializes,
and it passes judgment

00:17:07.710 --> 00:17:09.819 align:middle line:84%
on what's good and
what's not so good.

00:17:09.819 --> 00:17:12.500 align:middle line:84%
So they had a nice
relationship with the critics.

00:17:12.500 --> 00:17:16.040 align:middle line:84%
The challenge with the film as
it opened at that point in time

00:17:16.040 --> 00:17:17.210 align:middle line:90%
is the placement of the Sun.

00:17:17.210 --> 00:17:18.900 align:middle line:90%
It's at 18 Libra.

00:17:18.900 --> 00:17:20.300 align:middle line:84%
And it's in the
11th house, which

00:17:20.300 --> 00:17:23.880 align:middle line:84%
could be really good, but-- or
headed towards the 11th house.

00:17:23.880 --> 00:17:24.755 align:middle line:90%
But it's on the cusp.

00:17:24.755 --> 00:17:27.180 align:middle line:84%
It's on the cusp of
the 10th and the 11th,

00:17:27.180 --> 00:17:29.890 align:middle line:84%
so it's almost losing
its energy and its steam

00:17:29.890 --> 00:17:31.860 align:middle line:84%
coming out of the
10th and the 11th.

00:17:31.860 --> 00:17:33.800 align:middle line:84%
I'm imagining that
this film probably

00:17:33.800 --> 00:17:36.790 align:middle line:84%
did much better in
on-demand or DVD

00:17:36.790 --> 00:17:38.690 align:middle line:90%
than it did at the box office.

00:17:38.690 --> 00:17:40.840 align:middle line:84%
This would have been
the box office house.

00:17:40.840 --> 00:17:42.820 align:middle line:84%
Here it's moving into
the Aquarian house.

00:17:42.820 --> 00:17:45.760 align:middle line:84%
So I haven't seen
the figures, but I'm

00:17:45.760 --> 00:17:48.200 align:middle line:84%
assuming it did
much better then.

00:17:48.200 --> 00:17:52.620 align:middle line:84%
And we also have this opposition
here between Uranus and then

00:17:52.620 --> 00:17:53.270 align:middle line:90%
Saturn.

00:17:53.270 --> 00:17:56.140 align:middle line:84%
And when we get into
Uranus/Saturn oppositions, what

00:17:56.140 --> 00:17:58.300 align:middle line:84%
we're talking about is
the new versus the old.

00:17:58.300 --> 00:17:59.670 align:middle line:90%
Uranus is the new.

00:17:59.670 --> 00:18:00.760 align:middle line:90%
Saturn is the old.

00:18:00.760 --> 00:18:03.270 align:middle line:84%
So these are new mediums
versus old mediums.

00:18:03.270 --> 00:18:05.370 align:middle line:90%
Uranus is in Pisces down here.

00:18:05.370 --> 00:18:07.930 align:middle line:90%
It's at the bottom of the chart.

00:18:07.930 --> 00:18:10.100 align:middle line:90%
Again, Pisces represents film.

00:18:10.100 --> 00:18:11.570 align:middle line:90%
It's near the IC.

00:18:11.570 --> 00:18:14.870 align:middle line:84%
So it's kind of a new
take on an old medium,

00:18:14.870 --> 00:18:18.570 align:middle line:84%
but the power of Uranus in
Pisces, especially retrograde,

00:18:18.570 --> 00:18:19.660 align:middle line:90%
is not very great.

00:18:19.660 --> 00:18:22.170 align:middle line:84%
And again, up here
Saturn in Libra,

00:18:22.170 --> 00:18:23.996 align:middle line:84%
things moving towards
the 11th house,

00:18:23.996 --> 00:18:25.370 align:middle line:84%
moving towards
the future, moving

00:18:25.370 --> 00:18:29.374 align:middle line:84%
towards DVDs and
streaming and home video.

00:18:29.374 --> 00:18:30.290 align:middle line:90%
We can see that there.

00:18:30.290 --> 00:18:34.760 align:middle line:84%
And then over here we have Moon
in Cancer and Mars in Cancer.

00:18:34.760 --> 00:18:38.050 align:middle line:84%
And they're actually having
a nice trine with Uranus.

00:18:38.050 --> 00:18:40.520 align:middle line:84%
My sense on this
or my take on this

00:18:40.520 --> 00:18:44.120 align:middle line:84%
is that this film will
become more popular later on,

00:18:44.120 --> 00:18:46.220 align:middle line:84%
that this is a classic
that will be rediscovered.

00:18:46.220 --> 00:18:47.090 align:middle line:90%
All right.

00:18:47.090 --> 00:18:50.642 align:middle line:90%
Let's go to the next slide.

00:18:50.642 --> 00:18:54.490 align:middle line:84%
This is the chart of
Heath Ledger, his chart,

00:18:54.490 --> 00:18:56.740 align:middle line:84%
and it's the chart of
the opening of the film.

00:18:56.740 --> 00:18:58.520 align:middle line:84%
And I wanted to bring
these two together

00:18:58.520 --> 00:19:01.030 align:middle line:84%
because I think they're
pretty fascinating.

00:19:01.030 --> 00:19:03.650 align:middle line:84%
What we have here is
here's Heath Ledger.

00:19:03.650 --> 00:19:07.170 align:middle line:90%


00:19:07.170 --> 00:19:08.300 align:middle line:90%
He's the ascendant.

00:19:08.300 --> 00:19:12.170 align:middle line:84%
He is the Sun in Aries,
and that's his ascendant.

00:19:12.170 --> 00:19:15.667 align:middle line:84%
So he's an Aries Sun,
and he's an Aries rising.

00:19:15.667 --> 00:19:17.500 align:middle line:84%
And by the way, people
who have Aries rising

00:19:17.500 --> 00:19:19.484 align:middle line:84%
tend to lose their
hair fairly early,

00:19:19.484 --> 00:19:21.400 align:middle line:84%
so you can see where
Heath Ledger was actually

00:19:21.400 --> 00:19:24.000 align:middle line:84%
having a receding
hairline as a young man.

00:19:24.000 --> 00:19:25.719 align:middle line:90%
Of course, Aries rules the head.

00:19:25.719 --> 00:19:28.260 align:middle line:84%
And what we see in his chart is
actually a little disturbing,

00:19:28.260 --> 00:19:31.630 align:middle line:84%
because right across from
his Aries Sun is Pluto.

00:19:31.630 --> 00:19:34.080 align:middle line:84%
So he has a
Sun-Pluto opposition.

00:19:34.080 --> 00:19:37.090 align:middle line:84%
Now there are people that have
Sun-Pluto oppositions that

00:19:37.090 --> 00:19:39.660 align:middle line:84%
live much longer than
Heath Ledger did.

00:19:39.660 --> 00:19:43.700 align:middle line:84%
But nonetheless, we have to
take that opposition, certainly,

00:19:43.700 --> 00:19:44.787 align:middle line:90%
into account.

00:19:44.787 --> 00:19:46.870 align:middle line:84%
Now what's also really
interesting about his chart

00:19:46.870 --> 00:19:49.390 align:middle line:84%
is he has Mars in
the 12th house,

00:19:49.390 --> 00:19:52.270 align:middle line:84%
and he has Mars in
the sign of Pisces.

00:19:52.270 --> 00:19:54.910 align:middle line:84%
Now Mars in the 12th
house classically

00:19:54.910 --> 00:19:58.320 align:middle line:84%
means hidden enemies
or violence that

00:19:58.320 --> 00:20:02.140 align:middle line:84%
can erupt at any given
time, at a moment's notice.

00:20:02.140 --> 00:20:05.240 align:middle line:84%
Again, the 12th house
is a house of depth.

00:20:05.240 --> 00:20:07.620 align:middle line:84%
It's the house of
the cosmic void.

00:20:07.620 --> 00:20:09.280 align:middle line:90%
It's the house of the ocean.

00:20:09.280 --> 00:20:11.320 align:middle line:84%
It's a very hard house
to get a handle on.

00:20:11.320 --> 00:20:14.120 align:middle line:84%
So when we have a
planet like Mars there,

00:20:14.120 --> 00:20:17.540 align:middle line:84%
classical astrologers
rule that as an eruption,

00:20:17.540 --> 00:20:21.370 align:middle line:84%
as an eruption that happens
at some point in time.

00:20:21.370 --> 00:20:26.630 align:middle line:84%
Now he also has Mercury here
in the 12th house, which

00:20:26.630 --> 00:20:29.070 align:middle line:84%
if you're an actor
may not necessarily

00:20:29.070 --> 00:20:31.540 align:middle line:84%
be a bad thing
because you want to be

00:20:31.540 --> 00:20:34.110 align:middle line:84%
able to have that kind
of Piscean ability

00:20:34.110 --> 00:20:35.940 align:middle line:84%
to take on as many
different characters as

00:20:35.940 --> 00:20:37.930 align:middle line:84%
possible, shapeshift,
blend, dissolve

00:20:37.930 --> 00:20:39.790 align:middle line:90%
into another character.

00:20:39.790 --> 00:20:44.000 align:middle line:84%
And Mars there in the
12th house could actually

00:20:44.000 --> 00:20:49.330 align:middle line:84%
be kind of a catalyst
for that kind of almost

00:20:49.330 --> 00:20:51.310 align:middle line:84%
channeling, for
lack of better term.

00:20:51.310 --> 00:20:53.760 align:middle line:84%
But any time we get Mars in
Pisces in the 12th house,

00:20:53.760 --> 00:20:55.310 align:middle line:84%
we also have to
look at addiction,

00:20:55.310 --> 00:20:56.950 align:middle line:90%
because that comes up as well.

00:20:56.950 --> 00:20:59.020 align:middle line:84%
So in order for him
to get into character

00:20:59.020 --> 00:21:02.150 align:middle line:84%
or go into the 12th house,
he would need in some way,

00:21:02.150 --> 00:21:05.710 align:middle line:84%
shape, or form some type of
catalyst in order to do that.

00:21:05.710 --> 00:21:08.850 align:middle line:84%
Now when we look at the opening
of the film, what do we see?

00:21:08.850 --> 00:21:11.630 align:middle line:84%
We see that the Sun
is in Libra, and it's

00:21:11.630 --> 00:21:16.070 align:middle line:84%
conjunct Pluto in Libra
in Heath Ledger's chart.

00:21:16.070 --> 00:21:17.360 align:middle line:90%
Pretty interesting.

00:21:17.360 --> 00:21:20.750 align:middle line:84%
He also won the
Best Actor award.

00:21:20.750 --> 00:21:24.159 align:middle line:84%
He won that posthumously
after his death.

00:21:24.159 --> 00:21:25.200 align:middle line:90%
And what do we have here?

00:21:25.200 --> 00:21:29.570 align:middle line:84%
We have Pluto retrograde
and, yes, Mercury retrograde.

00:21:29.570 --> 00:21:33.350 align:middle line:84%
So it would make sense for him
to be able to win that award

00:21:33.350 --> 00:21:35.840 align:middle line:84%
after he had passed away,
tragically, unfortunately

00:21:35.840 --> 00:21:37.923 align:middle line:84%
after he had passed away,
his greatest achievement

00:21:37.923 --> 00:21:40.830 align:middle line:84%
and not being able to
enjoy it and share it

00:21:40.830 --> 00:21:43.110 align:middle line:84%
with other people
in this lifetime

00:21:43.110 --> 00:21:45.200 align:middle line:90%
and in this corporeal body.

00:21:45.200 --> 00:21:46.210 align:middle line:90%
So it's retrograde.

00:21:46.210 --> 00:21:50.610 align:middle line:84%
But with the Sun here on Pluto
opening day, what is it doing?

00:21:50.610 --> 00:21:53.330 align:middle line:90%
It's resurrecting Heath Ledger.

00:21:53.330 --> 00:21:54.950 align:middle line:90%
The film resurrects him.

00:21:54.950 --> 00:21:57.630 align:middle line:84%
It resurrects him
into our consciousness

00:21:57.630 --> 00:22:01.446 align:middle line:84%
because it hits his Pluto, and
his Pluto is opposite his Sun.

00:22:01.446 --> 00:22:03.320 align:middle line:84%
And that's what the
opening of the film does.

00:22:03.320 --> 00:22:05.670 align:middle line:84%
It brings Heath
Ledger back to us.

00:22:05.670 --> 00:22:07.340 align:middle line:90%
Very fascinating.

00:22:07.340 --> 00:22:10.320 align:middle line:84%
If there's anything else here
that I wanted to show you,

00:22:10.320 --> 00:22:13.890 align:middle line:84%
I think probably
the transits here

00:22:13.890 --> 00:22:17.590 align:middle line:84%
with Venus and Mercury and
Saturn in the 6th house,

00:22:17.590 --> 00:22:19.940 align:middle line:84%
because this is the house
of service and work,

00:22:19.940 --> 00:22:22.120 align:middle line:84%
and they're just off
of his true node.

00:22:22.120 --> 00:22:25.030 align:middle line:84%
If you notice, Heath Ledger's
south node is over here

00:22:25.030 --> 00:22:28.100 align:middle line:84%
in the 12th house, and that's
actually a very vulnerable spot

00:22:28.100 --> 00:22:33.820 align:middle line:84%
for the south node, especially
when it's with Mars conjunct.

00:22:33.820 --> 00:22:34.646 align:middle line:90%
Interesting.

00:22:34.646 --> 00:22:36.020 align:middle line:84%
So anyway, what
we're seeing here

00:22:36.020 --> 00:22:40.200 align:middle line:84%
is Mercury, Venus, Saturn
kind of coming back in, again

00:22:40.200 --> 00:22:44.380 align:middle line:84%
resurrecting, bringing energy
back into his house of work.

00:22:44.380 --> 00:22:47.520 align:middle line:84%
Now Heath Ledger also
had Neptune up here

00:22:47.520 --> 00:22:48.990 align:middle line:90%
in the 9th house.

00:22:48.990 --> 00:22:52.040 align:middle line:84%
So one of the things that he
did is he was born in Australia,

00:22:52.040 --> 00:22:54.420 align:middle line:84%
but he made his fortune,
he made his name

00:22:54.420 --> 00:22:57.470 align:middle line:84%
abroad in places like the
United States and in Europe.

00:22:57.470 --> 00:23:00.700 align:middle line:84%
So that would represent,
again, acting, Neptune,

00:23:00.700 --> 00:23:04.781 align:middle line:84%
and international commerce,
foreign lands, things

00:23:04.781 --> 00:23:06.280 align:middle line:84%
like that up there
in the 9th house.

00:23:06.280 --> 00:23:08.485 align:middle line:84%
So we can get a really
good picture, in some ways,

00:23:08.485 --> 00:23:11.060 align:middle line:84%
of Heath Ledger's
life to some extent.

00:23:11.060 --> 00:23:13.060 align:middle line:84%
We don't want to trivialize
it or minimalize it,

00:23:13.060 --> 00:23:14.810 align:middle line:84%
but I just wanted
to show you how

00:23:14.810 --> 00:23:16.311 align:middle line:84%
these two things
can work together.

00:23:16.311 --> 00:23:16.810 align:middle line:10%
OK.

00:23:16.810 --> 00:23:21.275 align:middle line:10%
So what we have here is
this is the same bridge

00:23:21.275 --> 00:23:23.560 align:middle line:10%
that Heath Ledger
was found hanging on.

00:23:23.560 --> 00:23:26.710 align:middle line:10%
And of course here's a
picture of Roberto Calvi,

00:23:26.710 --> 00:23:27.335 align:middle line:10%
"God's Banker."

00:23:27.335 --> 00:23:29.120 align:middle line:10%
If you want to find
out more about Roberto

00:23:29.120 --> 00:23:31.950 align:middle line:10%
Calvi and this whole
incident, there's your book.

00:23:31.950 --> 00:23:34.460 align:middle line:90%


00:23:34.460 --> 00:23:36.507 align:middle line:84%
Now here's where
it gets-- well, I

00:23:36.507 --> 00:23:38.590 align:middle line:84%
think all this is fascinating,
but that's just me.

00:23:38.590 --> 00:23:41.620 align:middle line:84%
But this is where it takes
a really interesting turn.

00:23:41.620 --> 00:23:44.010 align:middle line:84%
Now it's hard for you
to kind of see this,

00:23:44.010 --> 00:23:49.000 align:middle line:84%
but this is Heath Ledger and
he's hanging upside down.

00:23:49.000 --> 00:23:50.480 align:middle line:90%
He is suspended.

00:23:50.480 --> 00:23:54.720 align:middle line:84%
And this is from the
second "Batman" film.

00:23:54.720 --> 00:23:58.705 align:middle line:84%
And what we have here is
we have the Hanged Man--

00:23:58.705 --> 00:24:01.959 align:middle line:84%
I just wanted to show you
these two cards side by side--

00:24:01.959 --> 00:24:04.000 align:middle line:84%
we have the Hanged Man,
and he was the Hanged Man

00:24:04.000 --> 00:24:05.880 align:middle line:84%
in Parnassus, but it
was with the head.

00:24:05.880 --> 00:24:09.620 align:middle line:84%
Now he's assumed the role of
the Hanged Man here as well.

00:24:09.620 --> 00:24:13.160 align:middle line:84%
But he is also the
Joker, so he's the Fool.

00:24:13.160 --> 00:24:15.060 align:middle line:84%
He's the Fool, the
0 card, and he's

00:24:15.060 --> 00:24:18.140 align:middle line:84%
the number 12 card
in the Hanged Man.

00:24:18.140 --> 00:24:21.210 align:middle line:84%
And so what he was
doing is Heath Ledger,

00:24:21.210 --> 00:24:23.920 align:middle line:84%
within the span
of two movies, was

00:24:23.920 --> 00:24:27.890 align:middle line:84%
channeling intense
archetypal energy.

00:24:27.890 --> 00:24:31.610 align:middle line:84%
Any time you play the
Hanged Man and the Fool

00:24:31.610 --> 00:24:35.380 align:middle line:84%
together in a movie--
and our brains

00:24:35.380 --> 00:24:39.710 align:middle line:84%
don't really distinguish
between reality and television

00:24:39.710 --> 00:24:40.250 align:middle line:90%
and cinema.

00:24:40.250 --> 00:24:41.458 align:middle line:90%
We have to do that ourselves.

00:24:41.458 --> 00:24:44.560 align:middle line:84%
Our brains are just taking
these pieces of information

00:24:44.560 --> 00:24:48.830 align:middle line:84%
in all the time, which is
why movies and television can

00:24:48.830 --> 00:24:52.300 align:middle line:84%
be really powerful and
profound tools for programming

00:24:52.300 --> 00:24:54.900 align:middle line:84%
a person's mind and
their consciousness--

00:24:54.900 --> 00:24:58.310 align:middle line:84%
so when you're in character
like that, when you're assuming

00:24:58.310 --> 00:25:01.640 align:middle line:84%
the archetypal dimensions of
the Hanged Man and the Fool,

00:25:01.640 --> 00:25:07.575 align:middle line:84%
I'm sure it has pretty profound
and wide-ranging effects

00:25:07.575 --> 00:25:09.450 align:middle line:84%
on the life of the
individual and the psyche.

00:25:09.450 --> 00:25:13.230 align:middle line:84%
And remember, keep in mind
he had Mercury and Mars

00:25:13.230 --> 00:25:16.557 align:middle line:90%
in the 12th house.

00:25:16.557 --> 00:25:17.890 align:middle line:90%
Let's move on to the next slide.

00:25:17.890 --> 00:25:21.880 align:middle line:84%
This is, again, another kind
of interesting iteration

00:25:21.880 --> 00:25:23.950 align:middle line:90%
with this whole experience.

00:25:23.950 --> 00:25:25.610 align:middle line:10%
This is Jessica Savitch.

00:25:25.610 --> 00:25:32.100 align:middle line:10%
And Jessica Savitch was the
first female news reporter

00:25:32.100 --> 00:25:35.130 align:middle line:10%
to become an anchor.

00:25:35.130 --> 00:25:38.420 align:middle line:84%
She was an anchor for NBC, I
believe, the "Nightly News."

00:25:38.420 --> 00:25:40.300 align:middle line:84%
And she was a
terrific newsperson.

00:25:40.300 --> 00:25:44.685 align:middle line:84%
She was an Aquarius, and
she had her Sun very close

00:25:44.685 --> 00:25:45.890 align:middle line:90%
to her Midheaven.

00:25:45.890 --> 00:25:48.590 align:middle line:84%
Her chart, which I don't
have up here, is phenomenal.

00:25:48.590 --> 00:25:51.940 align:middle line:84%
She was a groundbreaking
television personality,

00:25:51.940 --> 00:25:55.100 align:middle line:84%
and you could see in her
chart that she was really

00:25:55.100 --> 00:25:57.530 align:middle line:84%
meant for big
things, huge things.

00:25:57.530 --> 00:25:59.860 align:middle line:84%
In fact, she was,
in her own way,

00:25:59.860 --> 00:26:03.220 align:middle line:84%
doing it when she was
the "Nightly News"

00:26:03.220 --> 00:26:04.740 align:middle line:90%
anchor on NBC for a while.

00:26:04.740 --> 00:26:06.610 align:middle line:84%
She started doing
independent reporting.

00:26:06.610 --> 00:26:09.460 align:middle line:10%
Now she dies on
October 23-- which

00:26:09.460 --> 00:26:12.110 align:middle line:10%
is the first day
of Scorpio, zero

00:26:12.110 --> 00:26:16.960 align:middle line:10%
Scorpio, death, sex, and
transformation-- in 1983.

00:26:16.960 --> 00:26:20.070 align:middle line:10%
Jessica Savitch
was the last person

00:26:20.070 --> 00:26:23.330 align:middle line:10%
to actually speak
with Roberto Calvi.

00:26:23.330 --> 00:26:25.660 align:middle line:84%
So she did an
interview with him,

00:26:25.660 --> 00:26:28.300 align:middle line:84%
and I don't know what
happened to that interview.

00:26:28.300 --> 00:26:30.870 align:middle line:84%
I think it's probably
gone, like Jessica Savitch.

00:26:30.870 --> 00:26:33.230 align:middle line:84%
But what's really strange
about how she passed

00:26:33.230 --> 00:26:36.520 align:middle line:84%
is she went out to dinner
one night with her husband,

00:26:36.520 --> 00:26:38.370 align:middle line:84%
and they were driving
back from dinner.

00:26:38.370 --> 00:26:40.500 align:middle line:84%
And for all intents
and purposes,

00:26:40.500 --> 00:26:43.175 align:middle line:84%
based on the news reports,
there was a little bit of rain.

00:26:43.175 --> 00:26:45.430 align:middle line:90%
It wasn't raining a whole lot.

00:26:45.430 --> 00:26:48.420 align:middle line:84%
But somehow she lost
control of the car,

00:26:48.420 --> 00:26:51.330 align:middle line:84%
and the car wound up
in an aqueduct next

00:26:51.330 --> 00:26:52.720 align:middle line:90%
to the side of the road.

00:26:52.720 --> 00:26:55.730 align:middle line:84%
And there wasn't a ton
of water in the aqueduct.

00:26:55.730 --> 00:26:59.070 align:middle line:84%
And somehow Jessica
Savitch and her husband

00:26:59.070 --> 00:27:04.120 align:middle line:84%
both died in the aqueduct, and
it was fairly shallow water,

00:27:04.120 --> 00:27:05.560 align:middle line:90%
a very suspicious death.

00:27:05.560 --> 00:27:07.800 align:middle line:84%
But again, if we're
talking about elements,

00:27:07.800 --> 00:27:11.900 align:middle line:84%
it's kind of a Scorpionic
passage in some ways.

00:27:11.900 --> 00:27:13.430 align:middle line:90%
Scorpio represents water.

00:27:13.430 --> 00:27:16.830 align:middle line:84%
But we're also looking for her
to do that, her car would have

00:27:16.830 --> 00:27:20.560 align:middle line:84%
had to have turned upside down,
which, again, brings us back

00:27:20.560 --> 00:27:23.240 align:middle line:84%
to the image of the
Hanged Man and being

00:27:23.240 --> 00:27:26.550 align:middle line:84%
suspended by the
feet, a Piscean image.

00:27:26.550 --> 00:27:29.740 align:middle line:84%
The end of the Piscean Age
using a Piscean medium, film,

00:27:29.740 --> 00:27:31.521 align:middle line:90%
in order to make that happen.

00:27:31.521 --> 00:27:32.020 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:27:32.020 --> 00:27:34.270 align:middle line:84%
So what I want to do now is
I want to the kind of set

00:27:34.270 --> 00:27:37.480 align:middle line:84%
the stage for the next clip,
because what we're about to see

00:27:37.480 --> 00:27:43.020 align:middle line:84%
is we're about to see
Heath Ledger in "Batman."

00:27:43.020 --> 00:27:45.750 align:middle line:84%
I believe it's one of the
final scenes of "Batman."

00:27:45.750 --> 00:27:49.680 align:middle line:84%
And if you've seen
the second "Batman"

00:27:49.680 --> 00:27:54.360 align:middle line:84%
film, if you don't really pay
attention, what you walk away

00:27:54.360 --> 00:27:57.790 align:middle line:84%
with from watching that film
is you think-- or at least

00:27:57.790 --> 00:27:58.690 align:middle line:90%
I did the first time.

00:27:58.690 --> 00:28:00.180 align:middle line:84%
I had to watch it
a couple times.

00:28:00.180 --> 00:28:04.820 align:middle line:84%
I thought that Heath Ledger's
character dies, but he doesn't.

00:28:04.820 --> 00:28:07.770 align:middle line:84%
The Joker doesn't
die in "Batman."

00:28:07.770 --> 00:28:10.000 align:middle line:84%
What happens is
he's left hanging.

00:28:10.000 --> 00:28:14.800 align:middle line:84%
He's left being suspended in
cinema, in time, forever frozen

00:28:14.800 --> 00:28:16.790 align:middle line:90%
in film, in our minds.

00:28:16.790 --> 00:28:18.870 align:middle line:84%
And so what that
means to me or what

00:28:18.870 --> 00:28:20.612 align:middle line:84%
it conjures for me
is that when you

00:28:20.612 --> 00:28:23.070 align:middle line:84%
look at all these elements,
when you look at Heath Ledger's

00:28:23.070 --> 00:28:25.450 align:middle line:84%
chart and you look at what
Terry Gilliam was trying

00:28:25.450 --> 00:28:28.940 align:middle line:84%
to do portraying the
hanging of Roberto Calvi--

00:28:28.940 --> 00:28:32.920 align:middle line:84%
oh, and by the way, in
the film Heath Ledger is

00:28:32.920 --> 00:28:34.690 align:middle line:84%
being chased by
Italian mobsters.

00:28:34.690 --> 00:28:38.600 align:middle line:84%
So again, Terry Gilliam is
trying to make allusions.

00:28:38.600 --> 00:28:41.210 align:middle line:84%
He's trying to tell
as much as he can

00:28:41.210 --> 00:28:42.780 align:middle line:84%
through the vehicle
of the movie.

00:28:42.780 --> 00:28:45.210 align:middle line:84%
And then we see the crossover
with Roberto Calvi, who,

00:28:45.210 --> 00:28:47.600 align:middle line:84%
by the way, is
also an Aries, just

00:28:47.600 --> 00:28:49.570 align:middle line:84%
like Heath Ledger,
born a little bit later

00:28:49.570 --> 00:28:52.680 align:middle line:84%
in terms of the degree of the
sun, but he's an Aries as well.

00:28:52.680 --> 00:28:56.860 align:middle line:84%
So we have this mirroring effect
going on in film and reality

00:28:56.860 --> 00:28:59.000 align:middle line:84%
and then coming all the
way back to Jessica Savitch

00:28:59.000 --> 00:29:00.660 align:middle line:90%
and back to film again.

00:29:00.660 --> 00:29:03.010 align:middle line:84%
So the question is,
what does it all mean?

00:29:03.010 --> 00:29:03.760 align:middle line:90%
Is there a truth?

00:29:03.760 --> 00:29:04.635 align:middle line:90%
Is there an epiphany?

00:29:04.635 --> 00:29:07.330 align:middle line:84%
Is there a revelation that
we can draw from this?

00:29:07.330 --> 00:29:10.490 align:middle line:84%
Or is it all about
inference and cipher?

00:29:10.490 --> 00:29:13.260 align:middle line:84%
Can you live with the
information at hand

00:29:13.260 --> 00:29:14.960 align:middle line:84%
and try to draw your
own conclusions?

00:29:14.960 --> 00:29:17.120 align:middle line:84%
Isn't that a lot like
life in some ways?

00:29:17.120 --> 00:29:20.550 align:middle line:84%
So without any further
ado, let's play this clip.

00:29:20.550 --> 00:29:24.680 align:middle line:84%
And I'll leave you with
the vision and the image

00:29:24.680 --> 00:29:28.570 align:middle line:84%
and the symbol of Heath
Ledger suspended as the Joker

00:29:28.570 --> 00:29:31.770 align:middle line:84%
forever without any truth,
without any resolution,

00:29:31.770 --> 00:29:34.250 align:middle line:84%
but allowing you to draw
your own conclusion.

stop this fighting.

Otherwise we'll
miss the fireworks.

>>There won't be any fireworks.

00:29:42.260 --> 00:29:45.350 align:middle line:10%

anyone these days.

You gotta do everything
yourself, don't we?

00:30:41.457 --> 00:30:42.455 align:middle line:10%
That's OK.

00:30:42.455 --> 00:30:44.970 align:middle line:10%
I came prepared.

00:30:44.970 --> 00:30:46.770 align:middle line:10%
It's a funny world we live in.

00:30:46.770 --> 00:30:48.910 align:middle line:10%
Speaking of which, you
know how I got these scars?

00:30:48.910 --> 00:30:50.161 align:middle line:10%
>>No.

00:30:50.161 --> 00:30:52.203 align:middle line:10%

[GRUNTS] [GROANING] Oh, you,
you just couldn't let me go,

00:31:14.490 --> 00:31:15.810 align:middle line:10%
could you?

00:31:15.810 --> 00:31:20.575 align:middle line:10%
This is what happens when
an unstoppable force meets

00:31:20.575 --> 00:31:23.542 align:middle line:10%
an immovable object.

[SIGHS] You truly are
incorruptible, aren't you, huh?

00:31:30.810 --> 00:31:35.590 align:middle line:10%
You won't kill me out
of some misplaced sense

00:31:35.590 --> 00:31:38.440 align:middle line:10%
of self-righteousness.

00:31:38.440 --> 00:31:45.386 align:middle line:10%
And I won't kill you because
you're just too much fun.

00:31:45.386 --> 00:31:50.675 align:middle line:10%
[CHUCKLES] I think you and I
are destined to do this forever.

padded cell forever.

up at the rate this city's

inhabitants are
losing their minds.

00:31:58.890 --> 00:32:04.500 align:middle line:10%
>>This city just showed you
that it's full of people

00:32:04.500 --> 00:32:06.380 align:middle line:10%
ready to believe in good.

>>Until their spirit
breaks completely,

00:32:10.180 --> 00:32:15.020 align:middle line:10%
until they get a good look
at the real Harvey Dent, huh,

00:32:15.020 --> 00:32:18.020 align:middle line:10%
and all the heroic
things he's done.

[CHUCKLES] You
didn't think I'd risk

00:32:21.220 --> 00:32:26.720 align:middle line:10%
losing the battle for Gotham's
soul in a fist fight with you.

00:32:26.720 --> 00:32:29.220 align:middle line:10%
[SIGHS] No.

00:32:29.220 --> 00:32:32.660 align:middle line:10%
You need an ace in the hole.

00:32:32.660 --> 00:32:33.802 align:middle line:10%
Mine's Harvey.

>>What did you do?

>>I took Gotham's white
knight, and I brought him down

00:32:41.810 --> 00:32:43.350 align:middle line:10%
to our level.

00:32:43.350 --> 00:32:44.450 align:middle line:10%
It wasn't hard.

00:32:44.450 --> 00:32:49.000 align:middle line:10%
See, madness, as you
know, is like gravity.

00:32:49.000 --> 00:32:51.990 align:middle line:10%
All it takes is a little push.

>> ROBERT PHOENIX: So just as
Parnassus and the Devil need

00:33:07.700 --> 00:33:11.420 align:middle line:10%
each other in "The Imaginarium
of Doctor Parnassus"

00:33:11.420 --> 00:33:15.040 align:middle line:10%
to define good and evil and have
the experience of redemption

00:33:15.040 --> 00:33:18.480 align:middle line:10%
and contrast to understand
one another, so, too,

00:33:18.480 --> 00:33:21.965 align:middle line:10%
do Batman and Joker need
each other in the same way.
