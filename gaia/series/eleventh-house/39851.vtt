00:00:15.583 --> 00:00:16.884 align:middle line:90%
>> Hi there.

00:00:16.884 --> 00:00:19.120 align:middle line:84%
This is Robert Phoenix, and
welcome to another edition

00:00:19.120 --> 00:00:20.354 align:middle line:90%
of The Eleventh House.

00:00:20.354 --> 00:00:23.023 align:middle line:84%
And today we're going to
be getting into the sign

00:00:23.023 --> 00:00:25.292 align:middle line:84%
of Capricorn which is
a lot more mysterious

00:00:25.292 --> 00:00:28.462 align:middle line:84%
than you might believe
and know about.

00:00:28.462 --> 00:00:31.232 align:middle line:84%
We're going to get into
not just the sign itself.

00:00:31.232 --> 00:00:32.466 align:middle line:84%
We're going to get
into the origins

00:00:32.466 --> 00:00:34.168 align:middle line:90%
and the roots of Capricorn.

00:00:34.168 --> 00:00:36.637 align:middle line:84%
We're going to talk a lot
about Pluto and Capricorn,

00:00:36.637 --> 00:00:38.973 align:middle line:84%
because that's where
we are right now.

00:00:38.973 --> 00:00:40.741 align:middle line:90%
Pluto is at nine degrees.

00:00:40.741 --> 00:00:44.178 align:middle line:84%
Capricorn is doing a square
dance with Uranus and Aries

00:00:44.178 --> 00:00:46.747 align:middle line:84%
and that's been taking
place for the last two years

00:00:46.747 --> 00:00:49.283 align:middle line:84%
and will continue to take
place over the course

00:00:49.283 --> 00:00:51.886 align:middle line:84%
of the next 18 months
to two years.

00:00:51.886 --> 00:00:54.788 align:middle line:84%
And it's a pretty important
aspect in astrology,

00:00:54.788 --> 00:00:57.558 align:middle line:84%
but we're not going to focus on
that so much, but we're going

00:00:57.558 --> 00:00:58.959 align:middle line:84%
to really get into
Capricorn today.

00:00:58.959 --> 00:01:01.862 align:middle line:84%
We're going to look at
Capricornian personalities.

00:01:01.862 --> 00:01:04.265 align:middle line:84%
We're going to look at Pluto
and Capricorn through history,

00:01:04.265 --> 00:01:06.133 align:middle line:84%
and we're going to try
to find some clues.

00:01:06.133 --> 00:01:09.403 align:middle line:84%
And we're going to try to
source out just exactly who

00:01:09.403 --> 00:01:11.739 align:middle line:90%
or what Capricorn might be.

00:01:11.739 --> 00:01:15.376 align:middle line:84%
So let's get into this right
away without any further ado.

00:01:15.376 --> 00:01:19.947 align:middle line:84%
So, when I started to research
Capricorn, what I was attempting

00:01:19.947 --> 00:01:23.551 align:middle line:84%
to do was I was attempting
to get into kind

00:01:23.551 --> 00:01:26.453 align:middle line:84%
of the astro-archeology
of the sign itself.

00:01:26.453 --> 00:01:28.355 align:middle line:90%
It's a fascinating sign.

00:01:28.355 --> 00:01:29.522 align:middle line:90%
It's pretty misunderstood.

00:01:29.522 --> 00:01:31.959 align:middle line:84%
It's associated with
the planet Saturn.

00:01:31.959 --> 00:01:37.765 align:middle line:84%
And one of the characters that
shows up very early in this sort

00:01:37.765 --> 00:01:42.736 align:middle line:84%
of pantheon of Capricornian
archetypes is Enki.

00:01:42.736 --> 00:01:48.676 align:middle line:84%
And Enki goes all the way back
to the Sumerian creation story,

00:01:48.676 --> 00:01:50.244 align:middle line:90%
the epic of Gilgamesh.

00:01:50.244 --> 00:01:54.048 align:middle line:84%
And, of course, that tale is
retold through the Akkadian

00:01:54.048 --> 00:01:56.483 align:middle line:84%
and the Babylonian culture
and the Phoenician culture,

00:01:56.483 --> 00:01:59.453 align:middle line:84%
and he actually shows up
with two separate names.

00:01:59.453 --> 00:02:01.589 align:middle line:90%
Right now we'll call him Enki.

00:02:01.589 --> 00:02:03.624 align:middle line:90%
He also goes by the name of Ea

00:02:03.624 --> 00:02:07.127 align:middle line:84%
which is a really interesting
name, particularly since we live

00:02:07.127 --> 00:02:11.599 align:middle line:84%
on the planet Earth, which
basically means "Ea's place."

00:02:11.599 --> 00:02:15.903 align:middle line:84%
So Enki means "Lord of the
Earth," which would translate,

00:02:15.903 --> 00:02:19.073 align:middle line:84%
obviously, to Ea which would be
Lord of the Earth or Ea's place

00:02:19.073 --> 00:02:21.141 align:middle line:90%
in Akkadia and Babylonia.

00:02:21.141 --> 00:02:24.578 align:middle line:84%
And here's where we get
the Capricornian imagery

00:02:24.578 --> 00:02:25.913 align:middle line:90%
and reference.

00:02:25.913 --> 00:02:28.716 align:middle line:84%
Enki is described as
having scales like a fish

00:02:28.716 --> 00:02:29.884 align:middle line:90%
and the body of a goat.

00:02:29.884 --> 00:02:32.519 align:middle line:84%
And I'm going to show
you in the next couple

00:02:32.519 --> 00:02:35.956 align:middle line:84%
of slides the original
depiction of Capricorn.

00:02:35.956 --> 00:02:38.726 align:middle line:84%
He looks like he's
part goat and part fish

00:02:38.726 --> 00:02:40.828 align:middle line:90%
or part goat and part dolphin.

00:02:40.828 --> 00:02:46.066 align:middle line:84%
One of the early, early people
in the Merovingian line,

00:02:46.066 --> 00:02:51.005 align:middle line:84%
Merovee, he's also described
as being born of a woman

00:02:51.005 --> 00:02:53.507 align:middle line:90%
and a sea bull or a sea goat.

00:02:53.507 --> 00:02:56.210 align:middle line:84%
So there's another kind
of Capricornian reference

00:02:56.210 --> 00:02:58.479 align:middle line:90%
in history to the personage.

00:02:58.479 --> 00:03:00.681 align:middle line:84%
So Enki is described as
having scales like a fish

00:03:00.681 --> 00:03:02.016 align:middle line:90%
and the body of a goat.

00:03:02.016 --> 00:03:05.319 align:middle line:84%
Now here's where it also takes
a really interesting turn.

00:03:05.319 --> 00:03:08.956 align:middle line:84%
In Syria, there's a temple
and it's known as Ugarit.

00:03:08.956 --> 00:03:14.161 align:middle line:84%
And there Enki is
known as El, E-L.

00:03:14.161 --> 00:03:17.598 align:middle line:84%
And the Phoenicians made
the connection between El

00:03:17.598 --> 00:03:19.800 align:middle line:90%
and the planet Saturn.

00:03:19.800 --> 00:03:23.237 align:middle line:84%
There's all kinds of places and
directions we can go with that

00:03:23.237 --> 00:03:25.239 align:middle line:90%
like Elohim and electricity

00:03:25.239 --> 00:03:29.009 align:middle line:84%
and a lot other interesting
el prefix words.

00:03:29.009 --> 00:03:33.314 align:middle line:84%
So in essence Enki,
Ea, El are Saturn.

00:03:33.314 --> 00:03:35.215 align:middle line:84%
And Enki is the early
manifestation

00:03:35.215 --> 00:03:37.184 align:middle line:90%
of Capricorn and the sea goat.

00:03:37.184 --> 00:03:40.721 align:middle line:84%
And we get the word
"elite" from El.

00:03:40.721 --> 00:03:43.924 align:middle line:84%
And when we think of
Capricorn, and especially Pluto

00:03:43.924 --> 00:03:45.192 align:middle line:84%
and Capricorn, and
when you'll see some

00:03:45.192 --> 00:03:47.561 align:middle line:84%
of these images I'll bring
up a little bit later,

00:03:47.561 --> 00:03:51.098 align:middle line:84%
the word "elite" is
actually fairly appropriate.

00:03:51.098 --> 00:03:54.535 align:middle line:84%
Let's bring up a bigger image
of Enki so you can see him.

00:03:54.535 --> 00:03:57.104 align:middle line:84%
By the way, I think pointed
hats are coming back.

00:03:57.104 --> 00:03:59.273 align:middle line:84%
I think the small hats,
I think they're over.

00:03:59.273 --> 00:04:02.176 align:middle line:84%
It's the pointed hats
with the space antenna.

00:04:02.176 --> 00:04:04.044 align:middle line:84%
I think they're making
a comeback here soon.

00:04:04.044 --> 00:04:06.046 align:middle line:84%
But you can see down
here there's a goat,

00:04:06.046 --> 00:04:08.716 align:middle line:84%
and we can also perhaps
infer a fish scales,

00:04:08.716 --> 00:04:13.320 align:middle line:84%
and here's fish coming out of
probably the Euphrates or one

00:04:13.320 --> 00:04:15.756 align:middle line:84%
of the rivers in the
Fertile Crescent,

00:04:15.756 --> 00:04:19.093 align:middle line:84%
and there's Enki
doing his thing.

00:04:19.093 --> 00:04:22.396 align:middle line:84%
He's, looks like he's
hypnotizing fishes.

00:04:22.396 --> 00:04:26.433 align:middle line:84%
But anyway, there he is in all
of his glory, his bearded glory.

00:04:26.433 --> 00:04:29.036 align:middle line:84%
And he has a really
interesting relationship

00:04:29.036 --> 00:04:31.004 align:middle line:90%
with his brother, Enlil.

00:04:31.004 --> 00:04:33.273 align:middle line:84%
And if you look at
the two of them,

00:04:33.273 --> 00:04:38.145 align:middle line:84%
they kind of represent these two
distinct poles of consciousness.

00:04:38.145 --> 00:04:41.615 align:middle line:84%
Enki is, he is the
father of beer.

00:04:41.615 --> 00:04:42.516 align:middle line:90%
He creates beer.

00:04:42.516 --> 00:04:44.385 align:middle line:90%
He's like the god of beer.

00:04:44.385 --> 00:04:47.988 align:middle line:84%
He also really likes music
and he likes sex as well.

00:04:47.988 --> 00:04:52.493 align:middle line:84%
In fact, he, I think he has an
affair or two with, at least one

00:04:52.493 --> 00:04:55.929 align:middle line:84%
with his daughter, which
is sort of, you know,

00:04:55.929 --> 00:04:58.966 align:middle line:84%
par-for-the-course
mythology, but also,

00:04:58.966 --> 00:05:01.869 align:middle line:84%
I believe with earth
women, as well.

00:05:01.869 --> 00:05:02.736 align:middle line:90%
So, he likes sex.

00:05:02.736 --> 00:05:03.937 align:middle line:90%
He likes beer.

00:05:03.937 --> 00:05:05.739 align:middle line:84%
He likes music -- sex and
drugs and rock and roll.

00:05:05.739 --> 00:05:06.940 align:middle line:90%
There's Enki.

00:05:06.940 --> 00:05:10.244 align:middle line:84%
And Ea is, he's kind of
the stiff board, you know.

00:05:10.244 --> 00:05:13.747 align:middle line:84%
Enki is sort of running
the operation on earth

00:05:13.747 --> 00:05:15.783 align:middle line:84%
and he's falling in
love with creation.

00:05:15.783 --> 00:05:17.584 align:middle line:84%
He's falling in love
with humans.

00:05:17.584 --> 00:05:21.121 align:middle line:84%
And Ea thinks he's doing
a fairly lousy job.

00:05:21.121 --> 00:05:28.262 align:middle line:84%
And eventually, Ea will step in
and wipe out Samaria and most

00:05:28.262 --> 00:05:30.964 align:middle line:84%
of the Fertile Crescent,
and that's where we get one

00:05:30.964 --> 00:05:33.934 align:middle line:84%
of the flood myths, the
antediluvian flood myths,

00:05:33.934 --> 00:05:35.903 align:middle line:84%
coming from that
part of the world.

00:05:35.903 --> 00:05:38.672 align:middle line:84%
So we have Ea as
being very strict

00:05:38.672 --> 00:05:40.707 align:middle line:90%
and very discipline-oriented.

00:05:40.707 --> 00:05:44.078 align:middle line:84%
And then we have Enki who
is actually very fun-loving

00:05:44.078 --> 00:05:46.513 align:middle line:90%
and jovial and beer-drinking.

00:05:46.513 --> 00:05:49.016 align:middle line:84%
And if you look at the
two of them in terms

00:05:49.016 --> 00:05:53.187 align:middle line:84%
of their definition, well, Enki
doesn't seem that Capricornian.

00:05:53.187 --> 00:05:56.056 align:middle line:84%
In fact, he actually
seems more Sagittarian,

00:05:56.056 --> 00:06:00.360 align:middle line:84%
whereas Enlil seems a
lot more Capricornian.

00:06:00.360 --> 00:06:05.332 align:middle line:84%
He actually fits the bill of
being more Capricorn and yet,

00:06:05.332 --> 00:06:06.300 align:middle line:90%
they have this sort

00:06:06.300 --> 00:06:09.002 align:middle line:84%
of diametrically
opposed personality.

00:06:09.002 --> 00:06:10.170 align:middle line:90%
It doesn't necessarily match

00:06:10.170 --> 00:06:13.006 align:middle line:84%
up with their astrological
assignation.

00:06:13.006 --> 00:06:16.310 align:middle line:84%
So, you know, maybe
what we're looking

00:06:16.310 --> 00:06:20.247 align:middle line:84%
at today is perhaps even
redefining Jupiter-Sagittarius

00:06:20.247 --> 00:06:21.949 align:middle line:90%
and Saturn and Capricorn.

00:06:21.949 --> 00:06:25.919 align:middle line:84%
Now, there are two other figures
historically that represent Enki

00:06:25.919 --> 00:06:30.457 align:middle line:84%
and Enlil fairly I would
say closely, and, of course,

00:06:30.457 --> 00:06:34.895 align:middle line:84%
they are Lucifer and Yahweh,
or Lucifer and Jehovah.

00:06:34.895 --> 00:06:37.965 align:middle line:84%
And Lucifer is very
much like Enki.

00:06:37.965 --> 00:06:40.534 align:middle line:90%
He's got the same reputation.

00:06:40.534 --> 00:06:41.869 align:middle line:90%
He's the light-bringer.

00:06:41.869 --> 00:06:44.738 align:middle line:84%
He's the, he's the guy that
falls in love with creation.

00:06:44.738 --> 00:06:46.607 align:middle line:90%
And Yahweh plays the heavy.

00:06:46.607 --> 00:06:50.077 align:middle line:84%
Yahweh is the guy that is
the bad father, you know,

00:06:50.077 --> 00:06:53.146 align:middle line:84%
he's like the bad father
and Enki's the good father.

00:06:53.146 --> 00:06:57.384 align:middle line:84%
You know, Enlil is -- sorry
-- Yahweh is the good cop and,

00:06:57.384 --> 00:07:00.854 align:middle line:84%
I said the bad cop and
Lucifer is the good cop.

00:07:00.854 --> 00:07:02.723 align:middle line:84%
So they have this
dance going on.

00:07:02.723 --> 00:07:04.324 align:middle line:90%
It's very, very similar.

00:07:04.324 --> 00:07:08.529 align:middle line:84%
And there could be this
correlation between the two,

00:07:08.529 --> 00:07:11.765 align:middle line:84%
not just mythologically but
in terms of their personae.

00:07:11.765 --> 00:07:16.370 align:middle line:84%
And again, you know, when
we associate the planets

00:07:16.370 --> 00:07:23.343 align:middle line:84%
with Lucifer/Satan and
Yahweh/Jehovah or Jove,

00:07:23.343 --> 00:07:26.980 align:middle line:84%
what we have again is we have
Saturn and we have Jupiter,

00:07:26.980 --> 00:07:28.515 align:middle line:90%
but they're transposed.

00:07:28.515 --> 00:07:32.920 align:middle line:84%
Jupiter and Sagittarius is the
sign that should be jovial,

00:07:32.920 --> 00:07:36.890 align:middle line:84%
it should be positive, it
should be nature-loving,

00:07:36.890 --> 00:07:39.259 align:middle line:84%
enjoys a good beer
like Hamlet --

00:07:39.259 --> 00:07:42.329 align:middle line:84%
I'm sorry, not Hamlet but
Falstaff from Shakespeare --

00:07:42.329 --> 00:07:48.235 align:middle line:84%
and Saturn and Capricorn is much
more dour; much, much harder,

00:07:48.235 --> 00:07:50.137 align:middle line:90%
much more disciplinarian.

00:07:50.137 --> 00:07:52.472 align:middle line:84%
So there's a strange
juxtaposition going

00:07:52.472 --> 00:07:53.674 align:middle line:90%
on in the heavens.

00:07:53.674 --> 00:07:58.345 align:middle line:84%
But there's another facet
to, especially to Enlil,

00:07:58.345 --> 00:08:01.815 align:middle line:84%
that we also have to take
into account because the sign

00:08:01.815 --> 00:08:05.586 align:middle line:90%
after Capricorn is Aquarius.

00:08:05.586 --> 00:08:10.657 align:middle line:84%
And if Enki is Capricorn,
then perhaps,

00:08:10.657 --> 00:08:14.394 align:middle line:90%
perhaps Enlil could be Aquarius,

00:08:14.394 --> 00:08:16.797 align:middle line:84%
because Aquarius
is the water-bearer

00:08:16.797 --> 00:08:18.665 align:middle line:90%
and what does Enlil do?

00:08:18.665 --> 00:08:20.601 align:middle line:84%
Enlil floods the
Fertile Crescent.

00:08:20.601 --> 00:08:21.868 align:middle line:90%
He brings the water

00:08:21.868 --> 00:08:25.572 align:middle line:84%
and basically destroys
that epic of history.

00:08:25.572 --> 00:08:28.709 align:middle line:84%
So we have this sort of
miscegenation of myth

00:08:28.709 --> 00:08:32.878 align:middle line:84%
and astrology and personae
and archetype all flowing

00:08:32.878 --> 00:08:35.147 align:middle line:84%
through these two individuals,
very pivotal individuals.

00:08:35.147 --> 00:08:37.651 align:middle line:84%
And if you go throughout
creation myths all

00:08:37.651 --> 00:08:41.021 align:middle line:84%
around the planet, you'll
see brothers or twins showing

00:08:41.021 --> 00:08:43.757 align:middle line:90%
up again and again and again.

00:08:43.757 --> 00:08:48.395 align:middle line:84%
And Enki, obviously, here is a
very important figure in terms

00:08:48.395 --> 00:08:50.831 align:middle line:84%
of not just what happened
in the epic of Gilgamesh

00:08:50.831 --> 00:08:54.334 align:middle line:84%
and the Fertile Crescent but
also in terms of, you know,

00:08:54.334 --> 00:08:57.804 align:middle line:84%
where we are with understanding
a particular aspect

00:08:57.804 --> 00:08:58.739 align:middle line:90%
of astrology.

00:08:58.739 --> 00:09:00.140 align:middle line:84%
So let's move on
to the next slide.

00:09:00.140 --> 00:09:03.043 align:middle line:84%
Here's another image
of Capricorn.

00:09:03.043 --> 00:09:06.146 align:middle line:84%
We have the goat and then
we have the fish tail

00:09:06.146 --> 00:09:09.216 align:middle line:84%
which is representative of
the half goat and half fish.

00:09:09.216 --> 00:09:12.319 align:middle line:84%
And here's a slightly
more modern version.

00:09:12.319 --> 00:09:16.323 align:middle line:84%
This is Eliphas Levi,
and this is Baphomet.

00:09:16.323 --> 00:09:19.226 align:middle line:84%
And here we have the
image of the goat again

00:09:19.226 --> 00:09:22.362 align:middle line:90%
and it is, well, it's unisex.

00:09:22.362 --> 00:09:27.067 align:middle line:84%
It's, this is how duality
is sort of resolved here.

00:09:27.067 --> 00:09:33.340 align:middle line:84%
We have this sort of unisex,
almost transexualized version

00:09:33.340 --> 00:09:37.244 align:middle line:84%
of the goat with female breasts
and probably male genitalia.

00:09:37.244 --> 00:09:40.614 align:middle line:84%
And then we have
the image of what is

00:09:40.614 --> 00:09:42.148 align:middle line:90%
above is below and so forth.

00:09:42.148 --> 00:09:43.650 align:middle line:90%
We have the two moons, the dark

00:09:43.650 --> 00:09:46.153 align:middle line:84%
and light crescent,
again duality.

00:09:46.153 --> 00:09:49.856 align:middle line:84%
And this image has become quite
popular in modern culture,

00:09:49.856 --> 00:09:52.059 align:middle line:84%
especially in terms
of heavy-metal music.

00:09:52.059 --> 00:09:53.860 align:middle line:90%
But we also see representations

00:09:53.860 --> 00:09:57.030 align:middle line:84%
in the 20th century
outside of occult circles

00:09:57.030 --> 00:09:58.598 align:middle line:90%
with Baphomet.

00:09:58.598 --> 00:10:02.669 align:middle line:84%
The famous curse of
the goat of Mendes

00:10:02.669 --> 00:10:07.474 align:middle line:84%
with the Chicago Cubs has
plagued them since the 1900s.

00:10:07.474 --> 00:10:10.077 align:middle line:84%
It's been along time
since the Cubs have gone

00:10:10.077 --> 00:10:13.380 align:middle line:84%
to the World Series
because they kicked a guy

00:10:13.380 --> 00:10:15.115 align:middle line:84%
out who brought his
goat into the stadium,

00:10:15.115 --> 00:10:16.850 align:middle line:90%
and he put a curse on the team.

00:10:16.850 --> 00:10:19.820 align:middle line:84%
And, of course, more
recently on 9/11,

00:10:19.820 --> 00:10:22.189 align:middle line:84%
George Bush was reading
a story about a goat

00:10:22.189 --> 00:10:25.125 align:middle line:84%
in the elementary school
in Florida when he was told

00:10:25.125 --> 00:10:28.729 align:middle line:90%
about the about the Twin Towers.

00:10:28.729 --> 00:10:35.502 align:middle line:84%
Here we have right
around 1517, 1518,

00:10:35.502 --> 00:10:39.473 align:middle line:84%
this is the last time before
the 1700s, so we're in Pluto

00:10:39.473 --> 00:10:42.309 align:middle line:84%
and Capricorn now, the
1700s right around the time

00:10:42.309 --> 00:10:45.045 align:middle line:84%
of the American Revolution
was the last time Pluto was

00:10:45.045 --> 00:10:46.413 align:middle line:90%
in Capricorn.

00:10:46.413 --> 00:10:49.116 align:middle line:84%
But I wanted to go back one more
cycle in Pluto and Capricorn

00:10:49.116 --> 00:10:50.217 align:middle line:90%
and see what was happening,

00:10:50.217 --> 00:10:52.853 align:middle line:84%
and there's actually
quite a bit happening.

00:10:52.853 --> 00:10:56.423 align:middle line:90%
This was around 1517, 1518.

00:10:56.423 --> 00:10:59.493 align:middle line:84%
Pluto goes into Capricorn
in 1516 exactly.

00:10:59.493 --> 00:11:02.963 align:middle line:84%
It's the year where Thomas
Moore's "Utopia" is released.

00:11:02.963 --> 00:11:04.531 align:middle line:84%
We're going to talk about
that on another show.

00:11:04.531 --> 00:11:06.099 align:middle line:90%
It's a very important book.

00:11:06.099 --> 00:11:08.602 align:middle line:84%
That pertains to Aquarius,
but we're into Capricorn.

00:11:08.602 --> 00:11:11.505 align:middle line:84%
So what's happening
in the 1500s is,

00:11:11.505 --> 00:11:12.873 align:middle line:84%
you have all these
principalities

00:11:12.873 --> 00:11:16.643 align:middle line:84%
in Europe basically going
around the world exploring

00:11:16.643 --> 00:11:19.246 align:middle line:90%
and conquering native culture.

00:11:19.246 --> 00:11:21.882 align:middle line:84%
This is the time
of colonization.

00:11:21.882 --> 00:11:24.484 align:middle line:84%
It's happening in
Spain, the Philippines --

00:11:24.484 --> 00:11:27.354 align:middle line:84%
I'm sorry, in Mexico, the
Philippines, South America.

00:11:27.354 --> 00:11:32.092 align:middle line:84%
All over the planet,
Western Europe is busy trying

00:11:32.092 --> 00:11:33.226 align:middle line:90%
to find the new world

00:11:33.226 --> 00:11:36.163 align:middle line:84%
and plunder the territory
of the new world.

00:11:36.163 --> 00:11:40.167 align:middle line:84%
And in some ways, this does
represent Pluto and Capricorn.

00:11:40.167 --> 00:11:45.505 align:middle line:84%
This is the oligarchy as
it was back in the 1500s,

00:11:45.505 --> 00:11:48.108 align:middle line:84%
going around the world,
and asserting its might,

00:11:48.108 --> 00:11:50.710 align:middle line:84%
asserting its will,
manifest destiny.

00:11:50.710 --> 00:11:54.314 align:middle line:84%
These are very difficult,
very hard times to live

00:11:54.314 --> 00:11:56.416 align:middle line:84%
in if you are an
indigenous person.

00:11:56.416 --> 00:11:59.519 align:middle line:84%
You're about ready to lose
pretty much everything

00:11:59.519 --> 00:12:02.422 align:middle line:84%
that you'd built
and worked towards.

00:12:02.422 --> 00:12:04.191 align:middle line:84%
This is only one
scene from that era.

00:12:04.191 --> 00:12:05.392 align:middle line:90%
There are plenty more.

00:12:05.392 --> 00:12:08.261 align:middle line:84%
What's also interesting
during that time is that's

00:12:08.261 --> 00:12:12.199 align:middle line:84%
when the West is making a
number of journeys to China.

00:12:12.199 --> 00:12:13.967 align:middle line:90%
And Kublai Khan, I believe,

00:12:13.967 --> 00:12:16.536 align:middle line:84%
was still in power then,
if I'm not mistaken.

00:12:16.536 --> 00:12:20.807 align:middle line:84%
So the whole consciousness
around China and what China had

00:12:20.807 --> 00:12:25.645 align:middle line:84%
to offer started to
infiltrate the Western psyche,

00:12:25.645 --> 00:12:28.281 align:middle line:84%
Western culture and
Western principalities.

00:12:28.281 --> 00:12:33.320 align:middle line:84%
So China rises in the early
days of Pluto and Capricorn.

00:12:33.320 --> 00:12:37.523 align:middle line:84%
Now unfortunately, because
there is colonization

00:12:37.523 --> 00:12:43.597 align:middle line:84%
and there is this Western elite
hegemony, we have the beginnings

00:12:43.597 --> 00:12:47.133 align:middle line:84%
of slave trade during Pluto
and Capricorn as well.

00:12:47.133 --> 00:12:52.105 align:middle line:84%
And this is an absolutely
tragic moment in human history

00:12:52.105 --> 00:12:55.508 align:middle line:90%
and it begins right around 1520.

00:12:55.508 --> 00:12:58.578 align:middle line:84%
And here we have a scene
depicting slave trade.

00:12:58.578 --> 00:13:00.747 align:middle line:84%
And again, it happens
with Pluto and Capricorn,

00:13:00.747 --> 00:13:06.720 align:middle line:84%
and we have this top-down sort
of structure pushing downward

00:13:06.720 --> 00:13:12.292 align:middle line:84%
to the lower classes and putting
them in indentured servitude.

00:13:12.292 --> 00:13:17.597 align:middle line:84%
The lower classes at that time
in Europe were actually in kind

00:13:17.597 --> 00:13:20.300 align:middle line:84%
of a different place than
then indigenous cultures

00:13:20.300 --> 00:13:21.368 align:middle line:90%
around the planet.

00:13:21.368 --> 00:13:23.169 align:middle line:84%
We're going to get
into this next slide,

00:13:23.169 --> 00:13:25.005 align:middle line:90%
and I'll tell you why.

00:13:25.005 --> 00:13:26.373 align:middle line:90%
Here we have the Black Plague,

00:13:26.373 --> 00:13:27.974 align:middle line:84%
and the Black Plague
happens during Pluto

00:13:27.974 --> 00:13:29.609 align:middle line:90%
and Capricorn as well.

00:13:29.609 --> 00:13:33.613 align:middle line:84%
And this is a really fascinating
period in human history

00:13:33.613 --> 00:13:38.118 align:middle line:84%
because Western Europe was
coming out of this period

00:13:38.118 --> 00:13:41.221 align:middle line:84%
where you had all of these
really skilled laborers.

00:13:41.221 --> 00:13:43.423 align:middle line:84%
They'd been working
on the cathedrals.

00:13:43.423 --> 00:13:44.824 align:middle line:90%
They knew how to do masonry.

00:13:44.824 --> 00:13:46.793 align:middle line:84%
They know how to
do stained glass.

00:13:46.793 --> 00:13:49.496 align:middle line:84%
They were getting very
interested in geometry.

00:13:49.496 --> 00:13:55.535 align:middle line:84%
This was a fairly educated
and well-versed society

00:13:55.535 --> 00:13:58.371 align:middle line:84%
of craftspeople who
were forming guilds.

00:13:58.371 --> 00:14:00.840 align:middle line:84%
They were starting to form
their own communities in,

00:14:00.840 --> 00:14:02.709 align:middle line:90%
I believe it was in Portugal,

00:14:02.709 --> 00:14:04.811 align:middle line:84%
there was a group
called the Communaros.

00:14:04.811 --> 00:14:08.915 align:middle line:84%
And they were starting to create
their own sorts of community

00:14:08.915 --> 00:14:13.420 align:middle line:84%
and civilization away
from what was being doled

00:14:13.420 --> 00:14:16.890 align:middle line:84%
out by the royal families and
elites who were all scrambling

00:14:16.890 --> 00:14:19.592 align:middle line:90%
at that time to have,

00:14:19.592 --> 00:14:21.661 align:middle line:84%
for a great land grab
in Western Europe.

00:14:21.661 --> 00:14:24.531 align:middle line:84%
But not just a land grab
but also an ideology grab.

00:14:24.531 --> 00:14:26.533 align:middle line:84%
There's all kinds
of deals happening

00:14:26.533 --> 00:14:29.169 align:middle line:90%
with the Vatican at that time.

00:14:29.169 --> 00:14:30.603 align:middle line:90%
You also have the Reformation.

00:14:30.603 --> 00:14:34.441 align:middle line:84%
Martin Luther is working on
his books during this period

00:14:34.441 --> 00:14:35.976 align:middle line:90%
of Pluto and Capricorn.

00:14:35.976 --> 00:14:40.246 align:middle line:84%
So at that time royalty was
trying to align themselves

00:14:40.246 --> 00:14:42.949 align:middle line:84%
with whoever was going to
have the religious might.

00:14:42.949 --> 00:14:47.654 align:middle line:84%
So you have this fusion of the
early stages of governance,

00:14:47.654 --> 00:14:49.823 align:middle line:84%
you know, bonding
with at that time,

00:14:49.823 --> 00:14:52.559 align:middle line:84%
which was even more powerful
than these early stages

00:14:52.559 --> 00:14:54.194 align:middle line:84%
of governance which
was the Catholic church

00:14:54.194 --> 00:14:56.062 align:middle line:90%
or the Reformed Catholic Church,

00:14:56.062 --> 00:14:59.065 align:middle line:84%
which was where Luther
was taking it.

00:14:59.065 --> 00:15:02.469 align:middle line:84%
But the "peasants"
or the common people,

00:15:02.469 --> 00:15:05.705 align:middle line:84%
they weren't really
completely under the bridle

00:15:05.705 --> 00:15:09.075 align:middle line:84%
of the noble families
of Europe and, in fact,

00:15:09.075 --> 00:15:11.111 align:middle line:90%
they were rising up in power.

00:15:11.111 --> 00:15:14.280 align:middle line:84%
Now, what happens here is,
just as they're starting

00:15:14.280 --> 00:15:18.218 align:middle line:84%
to get their feet under them,
the Black Plague hits Europe.

00:15:18.218 --> 00:15:22.489 align:middle line:84%
And some of the research I've
done on this actually points

00:15:22.489 --> 00:15:24.924 align:middle line:84%
to the Black Plague
being imported to Europe.

00:15:24.924 --> 00:15:28.061 align:middle line:84%
And what happened prior
to the Black Plague is

00:15:28.061 --> 00:15:32.365 align:middle line:84%
that the European nobility
took salt away from the people.

00:15:32.365 --> 00:15:34.934 align:middle line:84%
And apparently salt
was actually quite good

00:15:34.934 --> 00:15:36.403 align:middle line:90%
for their immune system.

00:15:36.403 --> 00:15:40.440 align:middle line:84%
And if you had a populous
who did not have ready access

00:15:40.440 --> 00:15:47.714 align:middle line:84%
to salt, they became much
more available to the effects

00:15:47.714 --> 00:15:50.316 align:middle line:84%
of the plague, much more open
to the effects of the plague.

00:15:50.316 --> 00:15:53.920 align:middle line:84%
So you had an entire group
of people, an entire caste

00:15:53.920 --> 00:15:56.923 align:middle line:84%
and class of people just
absolutely wiped out.

00:15:56.923 --> 00:16:00.627 align:middle line:84%
And on the back end of that,
you have again the nobility

00:16:00.627 --> 00:16:04.164 align:middle line:84%
and the royal families of Europe
making more of a land grab,

00:16:04.164 --> 00:16:06.132 align:middle line:90%
making more of a resource grab,

00:16:06.132 --> 00:16:08.568 align:middle line:84%
Disaster Capitalism
101 right here.

00:16:08.568 --> 00:16:10.737 align:middle line:84%
Now, the next person we're
going to see here is this guy.

00:16:10.737 --> 00:16:12.338 align:middle line:90%
This is Nostradamus.

00:16:12.338 --> 00:16:13.673 align:middle line:90%
He is a Capricorn,

00:16:13.673 --> 00:16:16.976 align:middle line:84%
and Nostradamus actually cut
his teeth during the plague.

00:16:16.976 --> 00:16:18.778 align:middle line:90%
He was trained as a physician,

00:16:18.778 --> 00:16:22.749 align:middle line:84%
and he helped quite a few people
during the time of the plague

00:16:22.749 --> 00:16:24.451 align:middle line:90%
and saved a lot of lives.

00:16:24.451 --> 00:16:25.919 align:middle line:90%
He probably used salt.

00:16:25.919 --> 00:16:30.423 align:middle line:84%
But what Nostradamus was
known for more than being kind

00:16:30.423 --> 00:16:34.661 align:middle line:84%
of an angel of the plague was
obviously his predictive models.

00:16:34.661 --> 00:16:38.498 align:middle line:84%
And Capricorn does rule time
so it would make a lot of sense

00:16:38.498 --> 00:16:40.767 align:middle line:84%
that Nostradamus
would have access

00:16:40.767 --> 00:16:42.969 align:middle line:90%
into what we would call time.

00:16:42.969 --> 00:16:44.337 align:middle line:90%
He was a scrier, by the way.

00:16:44.337 --> 00:16:47.107 align:middle line:84%
He did a lot of scrying with
mirrors and reflective pools.

00:16:47.107 --> 00:16:51.077 align:middle line:90%
That was his form of geomancy.

00:16:51.077 --> 00:16:52.378 align:middle line:90%
Okay, so here we go.

00:16:52.378 --> 00:16:55.748 align:middle line:84%
Now we're in America,
Revolutionary War,

00:16:55.748 --> 00:17:02.489 align:middle line:84%
right around 1776, and we are
looking at a famous battle.

00:17:02.489 --> 00:17:07.393 align:middle line:84%
And the Americans
obviously rallied under Pluto

00:17:07.393 --> 00:17:11.197 align:middle line:84%
and Capricorn, and we wound
up setting up this country,

00:17:11.197 --> 00:17:14.234 align:middle line:84%
the United States of America,
with the sun in Cancer.

00:17:14.234 --> 00:17:15.969 align:middle line:84%
That's actually a
really important fact

00:17:15.969 --> 00:17:18.972 align:middle line:84%
because it was opposite
Pluto and Capricorn.

00:17:18.972 --> 00:17:23.275 align:middle line:84%
And Cancer has a very
different signature than Pluto

00:17:23.275 --> 00:17:25.912 align:middle line:84%
and Capricorn, actually
Capricorn in general.

00:17:25.912 --> 00:17:28.648 align:middle line:84%
Cancer represents
home and nurturing

00:17:28.648 --> 00:17:32.886 align:middle line:84%
and to some extent
family, crops, food.

00:17:32.886 --> 00:17:37.857 align:middle line:84%
It's the sign that I think
embodies this country.

00:17:37.857 --> 00:17:40.760 align:middle line:84%
When we think of the United
States, we think about people

00:17:40.760 --> 00:17:42.428 align:middle line:84%
that come here from
other places.

00:17:42.428 --> 00:17:46.566 align:middle line:84%
Just last night I was
picked up by a cab driver

00:17:46.566 --> 00:17:49.769 align:middle line:84%
who had come here from the
Sudan, and he spent most

00:17:49.769 --> 00:17:53.907 align:middle line:84%
of his life in a refugee
camp as a Lost Boy in Kenya.

00:17:53.907 --> 00:17:55.208 align:middle line:84%
And now he's here
in this country

00:17:55.208 --> 00:17:56.810 align:middle line:90%
and he's actually really happy.

00:17:56.810 --> 00:17:58.244 align:middle line:90%
He's a miracle, this guy.

00:17:58.244 --> 00:18:03.049 align:middle line:84%
And so the Cancerian quality, or
the Cancerian traits of opening

00:18:03.049 --> 00:18:05.351 align:middle line:84%
up the home and nurturing
are still very much a part

00:18:05.351 --> 00:18:07.854 align:middle line:90%
of this country.

00:18:07.854 --> 00:18:09.322 align:middle line:90%
Speaking of nurturing.

00:18:09.322 --> 00:18:10.023 align:middle line:90%
No, I'm just kidding.

00:18:10.023 --> 00:18:12.158 align:middle line:90%
This is Al Capone.

00:18:12.158 --> 00:18:14.594 align:middle line:90%
He happens to be a Capricorn.

00:18:14.594 --> 00:18:17.597 align:middle line:84%
And what we're going to see
here through the succession

00:18:17.597 --> 00:18:20.767 align:middle line:84%
of images I'm about to show
you are personality types

00:18:20.767 --> 00:18:24.370 align:middle line:84%
or archetypes of Capricorn
in mostly modern America.

00:18:24.370 --> 00:18:26.306 align:middle line:84%
There are some people in
here that aren't American.

00:18:26.306 --> 00:18:28.208 align:middle line:84%
But you'll get to
see some tendencies.

00:18:28.208 --> 00:18:33.213 align:middle line:84%
Capricorn has a drive
to be ambitious

00:18:33.213 --> 00:18:34.581 align:middle line:90%
and a drive to succeed.

00:18:34.581 --> 00:18:38.351 align:middle line:84%
And it doesn't matter what field
of endeavor it shows up in,

00:18:38.351 --> 00:18:42.689 align:middle line:84%
Capricorn will generally
over time rise to the top,

00:18:42.689 --> 00:18:44.824 align:middle line:84%
because that's the
image of the goat.

00:18:44.824 --> 00:18:46.626 align:middle line:84%
Right? The goat climbs up the
mountain and gets up there

00:18:46.626 --> 00:18:48.061 align:middle line:90%
and says, "I've made it."

00:18:48.061 --> 00:18:51.598 align:middle line:84%
Well, at one point in time,
Al Capone was at the top

00:18:51.598 --> 00:18:54.701 align:middle line:84%
of the heap in terms of the
crime syndicate in this country.

00:18:54.701 --> 00:18:57.036 align:middle line:84%
An interesting side note about
Al Capone, and we're going

00:18:57.036 --> 00:18:59.806 align:middle line:84%
to get into this when we
get to Aquarius, one of his,

00:18:59.806 --> 00:19:03.042 align:middle line:84%
I wouldn't call him a buddy, but
somebody he knew from Chicago

00:19:03.042 --> 00:19:04.844 align:middle line:84%
and he spent a lot
of time talking

00:19:04.844 --> 00:19:07.814 align:middle line:84%
with is Saul Alinsky,
an Aquarian.

00:19:07.814 --> 00:19:10.350 align:middle line:84%
And we'll talk about Mr.
Alinsky a little bit later.

00:19:10.350 --> 00:19:12.318 align:middle line:84%
But there's Al Capone,
a Capricorn.

00:19:12.318 --> 00:19:15.054 align:middle line:84%
And lo and behold, there's
his buddy, J. Edgar Hoover,

00:19:15.054 --> 00:19:18.725 align:middle line:84%
yet another Capricorn, one
of the most ambitious men

00:19:18.725 --> 00:19:21.761 align:middle line:84%
in modern American
history, rising to the top

00:19:21.761 --> 00:19:24.230 align:middle line:90%
of the FBI very, very quickly.

00:19:24.230 --> 00:19:27.700 align:middle line:84%
And who do we have
after Mr. Hoover?

00:19:27.700 --> 00:19:31.838 align:middle line:84%
Speaking of ambitious, this is
what I call the dictator cycle.

00:19:31.838 --> 00:19:33.606 align:middle line:84%
We're going to see
three different people

00:19:33.606 --> 00:19:36.442 align:middle line:84%
that represent what I would
say would be the shadow side

00:19:36.442 --> 00:19:39.913 align:middle line:84%
of Capricorn, the
absolutely negative

00:19:39.913 --> 00:19:42.181 align:middle line:90%
and toxic side of Capricorn.

00:19:42.181 --> 00:19:43.449 align:middle line:90%
This is Mao.

00:19:43.449 --> 00:19:49.055 align:middle line:84%
And Mao, of course, uses
Capricornian energies to take

00:19:49.055 --> 00:19:52.458 align:middle line:84%
over a country, an ideology, and
right now that country is poised

00:19:52.458 --> 00:19:54.460 align:middle line:90%
to take over the world.

00:19:54.460 --> 00:19:57.864 align:middle line:84%
I mean, they have incredible
amounts of resources

00:19:57.864 --> 00:19:59.465 align:middle line:84%
and they have a lot of
dollars they want to dump.

00:19:59.465 --> 00:20:02.502 align:middle line:84%
But it all starts here with
this man who is a Capricorn,

00:20:02.502 --> 00:20:06.639 align:middle line:84%
and he sets the template for
China who is on the rise now

00:20:06.639 --> 00:20:07.940 align:middle line:90%
with Pluto and Capricorn.

00:20:07.940 --> 00:20:11.010 align:middle line:84%
This is their time and it
started with Capricorn Mao.

00:20:11.010 --> 00:20:14.347 align:middle line:84%
And here's Stalin,
another Capricorn.

00:20:14.347 --> 00:20:17.483 align:middle line:90%
It makes sense, doesn't it?

00:20:17.483 --> 00:20:21.721 align:middle line:84%
And I would say that in many
ways, Stalin was more successful

00:20:21.721 --> 00:20:23.990 align:middle line:90%
in the interim than Mao was,

00:20:23.990 --> 00:20:29.662 align:middle line:84%
but certainly Mao's long-range
Capricornian effect is having

00:20:29.662 --> 00:20:32.332 align:middle line:84%
more of an impact because of
what we've seen with Russia

00:20:32.332 --> 00:20:33.900 align:middle line:84%
and going through
the reformation

00:20:33.900 --> 00:20:35.201 align:middle line:90%
of Russia and the economy.

00:20:35.201 --> 00:20:38.604 align:middle line:84%
I just wanted to give you
an example of another sort

00:20:38.604 --> 00:20:39.872 align:middle line:90%
of dictatorial Capricorn.

00:20:39.872 --> 00:20:40.940 align:middle line:90%
Here's one more here.

00:20:40.940 --> 00:20:43.309 align:middle line:84%
Here's Richard Nixon,
another Capricorn.

00:20:43.309 --> 00:20:46.946 align:middle line:84%
And Nixon, you know, very
controversial figure.

00:20:46.946 --> 00:20:50.783 align:middle line:84%
He's the guy that got us
into having the dollar

00:20:50.783 --> 00:20:52.652 align:middle line:84%
as the reserve currency
around the planet.

00:20:52.652 --> 00:20:55.254 align:middle line:84%
If you want to buy oil,
you have to use a dollar,

00:20:55.254 --> 00:20:58.324 align:middle line:90%
and it's thanks to Mr. Nixon.

00:20:58.324 --> 00:21:00.893 align:middle line:84%
Maybe his Capricornian
paranoia got the best of him

00:21:00.893 --> 00:21:04.664 align:middle line:84%
with Watergate, but he's been
the last Capricorn president

00:21:04.664 --> 00:21:06.666 align:middle line:90%
we've had.

00:21:06.666 --> 00:21:08.968 align:middle line:84%
Here's another Capricorn,
Aristotle Onassis.

00:21:08.968 --> 00:21:10.136 align:middle line:90%
Are you seeing a trend here?

00:21:10.136 --> 00:21:12.772 align:middle line:84%
I mean, these are
super powerful people.

00:21:12.772 --> 00:21:14.807 align:middle line:84%
And when we look at
them, they're not like,

00:21:14.807 --> 00:21:16.142 align:middle line:90%
they're not middling power.

00:21:16.142 --> 00:21:18.244 align:middle line:90%
These guys, they are all in.

00:21:18.244 --> 00:21:19.212 align:middle line:90%
These guys are all in.

00:21:19.212 --> 00:21:22.615 align:middle line:84%
Onassis, very controversial
figure,

00:21:22.615 --> 00:21:24.550 align:middle line:90%
connected to the Kennedy family,

00:21:24.550 --> 00:21:26.819 align:middle line:84%
connected to the
Bransmens.

00:21:26.819 --> 00:21:30.289 align:middle line:84%
Rumor has it that he was
not just bringing rum

00:21:30.289 --> 00:21:32.992 align:middle line:84%
up from South America --
that's how he met the Kennedys,

00:21:32.992 --> 00:21:36.295 align:middle line:84%
by the way -- but other things
as well, including morphine

00:21:36.295 --> 00:21:39.298 align:middle line:84%
and heroin and built
his fortune on vice

00:21:39.298 --> 00:21:42.034 align:middle line:84%
like so many other people
did in the 20th century.

00:21:42.034 --> 00:21:44.003 align:middle line:90%
So he's a Capricorn.

00:21:44.003 --> 00:21:45.471 align:middle line:90%
Ah, speaking of Capricorns,

00:21:45.471 --> 00:21:47.607 align:middle line:84%
here's Mr. Jeff Bezos,
also a Capricorn.

00:21:47.607 --> 00:21:48.975 align:middle line:84%
We're going to talk a
little bit more about him

00:21:48.975 --> 00:21:53.346 align:middle line:84%
and what he's doing in
Aquarius when we start to look

00:21:53.346 --> 00:21:55.915 align:middle line:84%
at Aquarius, emerging
technologies,

00:21:55.915 --> 00:21:57.984 align:middle line:84%
and Jeff Bezos' latest
dream.

00:21:57.984 --> 00:22:02.121 align:middle line:84%
But again, Amazon is dominating
the space and what he is?

00:22:02.121 --> 00:22:04.223 align:middle line:84%
He's a Capricorn, and he
looks like he's a Capricorn

00:22:04.223 --> 00:22:06.993 align:middle line:84%
from space though
in that picture.

00:22:06.993 --> 00:22:08.361 align:middle line:90%
Okay, here we go.

00:22:08.361 --> 00:22:10.129 align:middle line:84%
Another great Capricorn,
Mohammad Ali.

00:22:10.129 --> 00:22:10.830 align:middle line:90%
What did he do?

00:22:10.830 --> 00:22:12.298 align:middle line:90%
He dominated the ring.

00:22:12.298 --> 00:22:17.637 align:middle line:84%
And Ali to this day still has
that kind of Capricornian impact

00:22:17.637 --> 00:22:21.240 align:middle line:84%
on culture even though he can't
talk and he can barely walk.

00:22:21.240 --> 00:22:22.308 align:middle line:90%
He has Parkinson's.

00:22:22.308 --> 00:22:25.311 align:middle line:84%
And what's really
interesting about Ali is

00:22:25.311 --> 00:22:29.449 align:middle line:84%
that his greatest rival in
the ring is Joe Frazier.

00:22:29.449 --> 00:22:32.118 align:middle line:84%
Joe Frazier also happens
to be a Capricorn.

00:22:32.118 --> 00:22:35.621 align:middle line:84%
And their fights are
epically Capricorn,

00:22:35.621 --> 00:22:37.023 align:middle line:90%
like the Thrilla in Manila.

00:22:37.023 --> 00:22:41.160 align:middle line:84%
These fights went on for, you
know, 15 rounds, and, you know,

00:22:41.160 --> 00:22:44.931 align:middle line:84%
each guy just literally
pummeling the other --

00:22:44.931 --> 00:22:47.934 align:middle line:84%
two Capricorns going
at it in the ring.

00:22:47.934 --> 00:22:49.936 align:middle line:84%
This is the apex of
boxing, by the way.

00:22:49.936 --> 00:22:52.738 align:middle line:84%
And it's no doubt
or no coincidence

00:22:52.738 --> 00:22:56.175 align:middle line:84%
that it happens with
two Capricorns.

00:22:56.175 --> 00:22:58.478 align:middle line:84%
There's another Capricorn:
Martin Luther King.

00:22:58.478 --> 00:23:00.046 align:middle line:84%
When we think of civil
rights, when we think

00:23:00.046 --> 00:23:03.449 align:middle line:84%
of humanitarian figures
in the 20th century,

00:23:03.449 --> 00:23:05.151 align:middle line:84%
it's Martin Luther
King, hands down.

00:23:05.151 --> 00:23:06.786 align:middle line:90%
He rises to the top.

00:23:06.786 --> 00:23:07.687 align:middle line:90%
He's very Capricornian.

00:23:07.687 --> 00:23:09.021 align:middle line:90%
He's controversial as well.

00:23:09.021 --> 00:23:10.389 align:middle line:90%
There are people who believe

00:23:10.389 --> 00:23:14.026 align:middle line:84%
that Martin Luther King actually
stole some of his speeches.

00:23:14.026 --> 00:23:17.396 align:middle line:84%
The famous "I Have a
Dream" speech has been,

00:23:17.396 --> 00:23:19.932 align:middle line:84%
he's been accused of
plagiarizing that speech.

00:23:19.932 --> 00:23:22.435 align:middle line:84%
There are people that talk
about Martin Luther King

00:23:22.435 --> 00:23:24.437 align:middle line:84%
and his background and
not being, you know,

00:23:24.437 --> 00:23:27.373 align:middle line:84%
the saint that people
would like to portray him.

00:23:27.373 --> 00:23:29.275 align:middle line:84%
But at the end of
the day, what we have

00:23:29.275 --> 00:23:34.380 align:middle line:84%
of him is the distilled
Capricornian image of somebody

00:23:34.380 --> 00:23:36.649 align:middle line:90%
who actually died for a cause,

00:23:36.649 --> 00:23:39.118 align:middle line:84%
and that's how we'll
remember him.

00:23:40.186 --> 00:23:41.888 align:middle line:90%
Here's Elvis, another Capricorn.

00:23:41.888 --> 00:23:43.389 align:middle line:90%
And again, what do we see?

00:23:43.389 --> 00:23:45.491 align:middle line:84%
We saw somebody who rose
to the top of the charts.

00:23:45.491 --> 00:23:50.296 align:middle line:84%
He became synonymous with the
-- he wasn't a song writer,

00:23:50.296 --> 00:23:54.200 align:middle line:84%
but the icon and the archetype
of the singer at the end

00:23:54.200 --> 00:23:58.504 align:middle line:84%
of the 1950s and the beginning
of the 1960s and, of course,

00:23:58.504 --> 00:24:01.774 align:middle line:84%
he was quite wealthy
which is another potential

00:24:01.774 --> 00:24:03.709 align:middle line:90%
Capricornian trait.

00:24:03.709 --> 00:24:06.212 align:middle line:84%
Unlike some of the other
Capricorns, though,

00:24:06.212 --> 00:24:10.449 align:middle line:84%
he has a strange kind of
deference to Colonel Tom Parker.

00:24:10.449 --> 00:24:12.318 align:middle line:84%
You wouldn't normally
see that with Capricorns.

00:24:12.318 --> 00:24:16.355 align:middle line:84%
They tend to run their own ship,
but Colonel Tom Parker had kind

00:24:16.355 --> 00:24:20.159 align:middle line:84%
of an almost Svengali-like
hypnotic spell

00:24:20.159 --> 00:24:22.161 align:middle line:90%
over Mr. Elvis Presley.

00:24:22.161 --> 00:24:25.865 align:middle line:84%
Now, Elvis Presley shares his
birthday with this Capricorn.

00:24:25.865 --> 00:24:27.433 align:middle line:90%
This is David Bowie.

00:24:27.433 --> 00:24:31.237 align:middle line:84%
And David Bowie was one of
the most successful rock

00:24:31.237 --> 00:24:35.207 align:middle line:84%
and roll artists in terms
of money and capital.

00:24:35.207 --> 00:24:37.043 align:middle line:84%
He's a pretty good
businessman, Bowie.

00:24:37.043 --> 00:24:40.646 align:middle line:84%
In fact, he turned himself into
a corporation back at the end

00:24:40.646 --> 00:24:44.050 align:middle line:84%
of the '90s and started selling
shares in him and his work.

00:24:44.050 --> 00:24:47.253 align:middle line:84%
Now, I interviewed David Bowie
one time in New York City,

00:24:47.253 --> 00:24:49.121 align:middle line:84%
and we talked about
him being a Capricorn.

00:24:49.121 --> 00:24:50.823 align:middle line:84%
He told me something
really interesting.

00:24:50.823 --> 00:24:54.560 align:middle line:84%
He told me that the closer
he gets to his birthday --

00:24:54.560 --> 00:24:56.963 align:middle line:84%
he has two bumps, one
here and one here --

00:24:56.963 --> 00:25:00.066 align:middle line:84%
he says that they actually
begin to grow and tend

00:25:00.066 --> 00:25:04.837 align:middle line:84%
to protrude almost
out of his forehead

00:25:04.837 --> 00:25:07.173 align:middle line:84%
at both these little
places right over here.

00:25:07.173 --> 00:25:11.377 align:middle line:84%
There's a little bit of
David Bowie trivia for you.

00:25:11.377 --> 00:25:12.345 align:middle line:90%
Here's Patti Smith.

00:25:12.345 --> 00:25:13.846 align:middle line:84%
She's one of my favorite
Capricorns.

00:25:13.846 --> 00:25:17.483 align:middle line:90%
I think she's terrific and she,

00:25:17.483 --> 00:25:20.586 align:middle line:84%
I think Patti Smith will be
making a comeback at some point,

00:25:20.586 --> 00:25:23.456 align:middle line:84%
some point over the course of
the next five to six years.

00:25:23.456 --> 00:25:24.423 align:middle line:90%
She's already kind of started.

00:25:24.423 --> 00:25:26.859 align:middle line:84%
She did a commercial
last year for,

00:25:26.859 --> 00:25:28.995 align:middle line:84%
I think it was The
Gap or Levi's.

00:25:28.995 --> 00:25:30.896 align:middle line:84%
It was kind of strange
seeing Patti Smith get really

00:25:30.896 --> 00:25:33.733 align:middle line:84%
commercial, but love
Patti Smith.

00:25:33.733 --> 00:25:34.567 align:middle line:90%
She's a Capricorn.

00:25:34.567 --> 00:25:36.235 align:middle line:90%
I had to put her in there.

00:25:36.235 --> 00:25:37.336 align:middle line:90%
Here's another Capricorn.

00:25:37.336 --> 00:25:40.139 align:middle line:84%
Now, Betty White is
interesting because part

00:25:40.139 --> 00:25:44.176 align:middle line:84%
of this whole notion of
Capricorn is that they tend

00:25:44.176 --> 00:25:48.481 align:middle line:84%
to get, they tend to get
younger as they get older.

00:25:48.481 --> 00:25:52.485 align:middle line:84%
And Betty White obviously
is a living,

00:25:52.485 --> 00:25:54.387 align:middle line:90%
breathing example of that.

00:25:54.387 --> 00:25:57.356 align:middle line:84%
If you've seen the
movie "The Curious Case

00:25:57.356 --> 00:25:58.424 align:middle line:90%
of Benjamin Button,"

00:25:58.424 --> 00:26:00.426 align:middle line:84%
that's actually a
meditation on Capricorn.

00:26:00.426 --> 00:26:04.363 align:middle line:84%
Right? I mean, he starts
off being born as an old man

00:26:04.363 --> 00:26:06.832 align:middle line:84%
and as he goes through this arc,
and by the time he's at the end

00:26:06.832 --> 00:26:08.601 align:middle line:90%
of his life, he's a baby again.

00:26:08.601 --> 00:26:10.236 align:middle line:84%
That's actually Capricorn
in action.

00:26:10.236 --> 00:26:15.341 align:middle line:84%
So Betty White, flashing the
Capricorn genes right there.

00:26:15.341 --> 00:26:16.842 align:middle line:84%
Okay, so we're going
to talk right here.

00:26:16.842 --> 00:26:18.244 align:middle line:84%
We're going to stop
just for a little bit.

00:26:18.244 --> 00:26:21.380 align:middle line:84%
We're going to get into these
people, and we're going to shift

00:26:21.380 --> 00:26:25.184 align:middle line:84%
into Cancer, because Cancer,
the sign Cancer is, I think,

00:26:25.184 --> 00:26:26.552 align:middle line:90%
really prominent right now.

00:26:26.552 --> 00:26:29.288 align:middle line:84%
We're going to talk about it
in terms of American culture.

00:26:29.288 --> 00:26:32.291 align:middle line:84%
But to understand why it's
important, we have to go back

00:26:32.291 --> 00:26:37.129 align:middle line:84%
to 2008, 2009, because
that's when Pluto moves

00:26:37.129 --> 00:26:39.598 align:middle line:84%
from Sagittarius into
the sign of Capricorn.

00:26:39.598 --> 00:26:42.702 align:middle line:84%
That's when it's at its
most potent, zero degrees.

00:26:42.702 --> 00:26:45.071 align:middle line:84%
And that's this very
strange time

00:26:45.071 --> 00:26:48.207 align:middle line:90%
between Obama and George Bush.

00:26:48.207 --> 00:26:52.545 align:middle line:84%
And what happened, of course,
obviously in October 2008,

00:26:52.545 --> 00:26:55.314 align:middle line:84%
the company -- or company; the
company of the United States --

00:26:55.314 --> 00:27:00.453 align:middle line:84%
the country went belly-up, and
it was convenient in that it was

00:27:00.453 --> 00:27:03.456 align:middle line:84%
in that strange inter-zone
between presidents

00:27:03.456 --> 00:27:06.292 align:middle line:84%
where nobody was theoretically
responsible for it.

00:27:06.292 --> 00:27:07.493 align:middle line:90%
The people running the country

00:27:07.493 --> 00:27:11.063 align:middle line:84%
at that time were Ben
Bernanke and Hank Paulson.

00:27:11.063 --> 00:27:13.065 align:middle line:84%
And everybody can
remember it clear as day.

00:27:13.065 --> 00:27:17.970 align:middle line:84%
We, you know, the country
was theoretically bankrupt

00:27:17.970 --> 00:27:20.306 align:middle line:90%
and people were dialing in.

00:27:20.306 --> 00:27:22.408 align:middle line:84%
They were burning up
the lines in Washington.

00:27:22.408 --> 00:27:25.411 align:middle line:84%
They were, you know, desperately
trying to get these guys not

00:27:25.411 --> 00:27:26.712 align:middle line:90%
to bail out Wall Street.

00:27:26.712 --> 00:27:28.380 align:middle line:90%
I mean, it was a big deal.

00:27:28.380 --> 00:27:31.350 align:middle line:84%
In fact, they made such an
impact on the congressmen

00:27:31.350 --> 00:27:34.687 align:middle line:84%
and the senators, that
they actually voted once,

00:27:34.687 --> 00:27:39.158 align:middle line:84%
and they rejected what was
the initial TARP bailout bill.

00:27:39.158 --> 00:27:43.863 align:middle line:84%
That's how terrified
Congress and the Senate were

00:27:43.863 --> 00:27:45.898 align:middle line:90%
of the people during that time.

00:27:45.898 --> 00:27:48.634 align:middle line:84%
And then Bernanke and Paulson
got behind closed doors

00:27:48.634 --> 00:27:52.338 align:middle line:84%
and the rumor is they said,
"Unless you vote for this,

00:27:52.338 --> 00:27:53.939 align:middle line:84%
unless you vote for
this, there is going

00:27:53.939 --> 00:27:55.741 align:middle line:90%
to be martial law in America."

00:27:55.741 --> 00:27:58.944 align:middle line:84%
And so they voted for it and
then we had TARP as a result.

00:27:58.944 --> 00:28:00.513 align:middle line:90%
Now, immediately,

00:28:00.513 --> 00:28:03.416 align:middle line:84%
almost immediately businesses
started getting bailed

00:28:03.416 --> 00:28:04.550 align:middle line:90%
out right and left.

00:28:04.550 --> 00:28:07.987 align:middle line:84%
You had AIG, there was
GM, there was IndyMac,

00:28:07.987 --> 00:28:10.256 align:middle line:84%
although I don't think
IndyMac got bailed out.

00:28:10.256 --> 00:28:16.629 align:middle line:84%
But we saw Freddie Mac and --
I always get them mixed up,

00:28:16.629 --> 00:28:20.666 align:middle line:90%
the mortgage and loan.

00:28:20.666 --> 00:28:23.569 align:middle line:84%
Anyway, they got
bailed out immediately,

00:28:23.569 --> 00:28:27.206 align:middle line:84%
and we saw this fusion
between government

00:28:27.206 --> 00:28:30.242 align:middle line:84%
and the corporations
during that time.

00:28:30.242 --> 00:28:34.180 align:middle line:84%
And that was the shot across
the bow for Pluto and Capricorn.

00:28:34.180 --> 00:28:39.985 align:middle line:84%
And that sort of morphing
became the corpocratic system

00:28:39.985 --> 00:28:42.354 align:middle line:84%
that we're all kind of trying
to figure out right now.

00:28:42.354 --> 00:28:47.193 align:middle line:84%
It's like Obamacare is
this beast that's part,

00:28:47.193 --> 00:28:50.429 align:middle line:84%
it's part government and
it's part corporation.

00:28:50.429 --> 00:28:53.732 align:middle line:84%
They're trying to bolt this
Frankenstein monster together,

00:28:53.732 --> 00:28:55.835 align:middle line:84%
and it's happening under
Pluto and Capricorn.

00:28:55.835 --> 00:28:58.571 align:middle line:84%
They're not having a real
successful time with it.

00:28:58.571 --> 00:29:02.174 align:middle line:84%
Now, almost immediately what
happened is you had a backlash

00:29:02.174 --> 00:29:06.512 align:middle line:84%
against this type of
titanic and monolithic fusion

00:29:06.512 --> 00:29:11.250 align:middle line:84%
of these two entities, and
what we've seen as a result

00:29:11.250 --> 00:29:15.888 align:middle line:84%
of this is this kind of
Cancerian undercurrent beginning

00:29:15.888 --> 00:29:17.923 align:middle line:90%
to flow through the country.

00:29:17.923 --> 00:29:21.827 align:middle line:84%
And it starts really, I
think, with this show as kind

00:29:21.827 --> 00:29:23.796 align:middle line:84%
of an outward manifestation
of this.

00:29:23.796 --> 00:29:28.133 align:middle line:84%
This is American Pickers, and
these guys are from the Midwest

00:29:28.133 --> 00:29:30.703 align:middle line:84%
and that's about as
Cancerian as it gets.

00:29:30.703 --> 00:29:33.339 align:middle line:84%
And they go around to all
these different locations

00:29:33.339 --> 00:29:35.908 align:middle line:84%
and what they do is
they find odds and ends.

00:29:35.908 --> 00:29:37.309 align:middle line:90%
You've probably seen the show.

00:29:37.309 --> 00:29:39.812 align:middle line:84%
They find these odds and ends,
these strange little antiques,

00:29:39.812 --> 00:29:41.714 align:middle line:84%
these, you know, these
diamonds in the rough.

00:29:41.714 --> 00:29:43.449 align:middle line:90%
And they buy them for one price

00:29:43.449 --> 00:29:44.750 align:middle line:84%
and they resell them
for another.

00:29:44.750 --> 00:29:47.720 align:middle line:84%
That's a very Cancerian kind
of activity, by the way,

00:29:47.720 --> 00:29:50.623 align:middle line:84%
because Cancer is always
looking to the past.

00:29:50.623 --> 00:29:53.225 align:middle line:84%
Capricorn looks towards
the future;

00:29:53.225 --> 00:29:54.460 align:middle line:90%
Cancer looks to the past.

00:29:54.460 --> 00:29:55.594 align:middle line:90%
So these guys

00:29:55.594 --> 00:29:56.896 align:middle line:90%
are resurrecting the past.

00:29:56.896 --> 00:30:00.833 align:middle line:84%
This is a very Cancerian
operation with American Pickers.

00:30:00.833 --> 00:30:04.069 align:middle line:84%
Even the name American
Pickers resonates

00:30:04.069 --> 00:30:07.873 align:middle line:84%
with the whole
Cancerian/American vibration.

00:30:07.873 --> 00:30:09.441 align:middle line:84%
So let's go on to
the next slide.

00:30:09.441 --> 00:30:13.946 align:middle line:84%
And here we have Moonshiners,
yet another kind of Cancerian,

00:30:13.946 --> 00:30:17.516 align:middle line:84%
folksy depiction
of rural Americana.

00:30:17.516 --> 00:30:19.852 align:middle line:90%
And what are these guys doing?

00:30:19.852 --> 00:30:20.920 align:middle line:90%
They're making moonshine.

00:30:20.920 --> 00:30:21.887 align:middle line:90%
They're making liquid.

00:30:21.887 --> 00:30:23.622 align:middle line:90%
Cancer is a water sign.

00:30:23.622 --> 00:30:25.057 align:middle line:84%
You know, this is
very homegrown.

00:30:25.057 --> 00:30:26.525 align:middle line:90%
This is very homespun.

00:30:26.525 --> 00:30:29.595 align:middle line:84%
And these guys typify
and embody this kind

00:30:29.595 --> 00:30:32.531 align:middle line:84%
of Cancerian spirit
in a Mason jar.

00:30:32.531 --> 00:30:34.500 align:middle line:84%
That's a funny name for
that, isn't it, a Mason jar?

00:30:34.500 --> 00:30:39.772 align:middle line:84%
Anyway, a very successful show,
and it translates really well

00:30:39.772 --> 00:30:43.642 align:middle line:84%
to again this undercurrent,
this folksy undercurrent

00:30:43.642 --> 00:30:47.880 align:middle line:84%
that people are taking part
in, that's almost like a,

00:30:47.880 --> 00:30:51.717 align:middle line:84%
I would say, a subconscious
backlash in some ways

00:30:51.717 --> 00:30:54.887 align:middle line:84%
to this Pluto and
Capricornian sort of tyranny

00:30:54.887 --> 00:30:57.723 align:middle line:84%
that we're being forced to
deal with on a daily basis.

00:30:57.723 --> 00:31:01.827 align:middle line:84%
Now, this next slide is --
these are the Duck Dynasty guys.

00:31:01.827 --> 00:31:07.800 align:middle line:84%
And this, these guys, to me,
typify this Cancerian spirit.

00:31:07.800 --> 00:31:12.438 align:middle line:84%
Why? It's all family, it's
all, it's a family business,

00:31:12.438 --> 00:31:15.841 align:middle line:84%
they honor family, their
wives cook for them.

00:31:15.841 --> 00:31:17.109 align:middle line:90%
Very traditional.

00:31:17.109 --> 00:31:21.280 align:middle line:84%
This is not some kind of
Capricornian, bathometric kind

00:31:21.280 --> 00:31:23.549 align:middle line:84%
of assemblage of
the family matrix.

00:31:23.549 --> 00:31:29.788 align:middle line:84%
This is in many ways a very
strong and rural depiction

00:31:29.788 --> 00:31:33.325 align:middle line:84%
of America, the Cancerian
America.

00:31:33.325 --> 00:31:38.030 align:middle line:84%
Now, Duck Dynasty this
season, the opening episode

00:31:38.030 --> 00:31:41.367 align:middle line:84%
for Duck Dynasty this season
was the most popular show

00:31:41.367 --> 00:31:43.669 align:middle line:90%
in the history of cable TV.

00:31:43.669 --> 00:31:45.270 align:middle line:90%
So while we're dealing

00:31:45.270 --> 00:31:49.508 align:middle line:84%
with again these oligarchic
structures that are trying

00:31:49.508 --> 00:31:53.545 align:middle line:84%
to impress themselves upon us,
what's happening as a result

00:31:53.545 --> 00:31:56.949 align:middle line:84%
of this is we're
having this infusion

00:31:56.949 --> 00:32:01.286 align:middle line:84%
of this Cancerian culture that's
taking place underneath all

00:32:01.286 --> 00:32:02.454 align:middle line:90%
of it.

00:32:02.454 --> 00:32:05.657 align:middle line:84%
And together there's
this dynamism of change

00:32:05.657 --> 00:32:09.828 align:middle line:84%
and transformation that's taking
place all around us right now.

00:32:09.828 --> 00:32:12.598 align:middle line:84%
Now, I decided to bring
Ron Paul into this.

00:32:12.598 --> 00:32:15.501 align:middle line:84%
I used to be a kind
of a Ron Paul guy,

00:32:15.501 --> 00:32:22.841 align:middle line:84%
although I basically changed
my mind at some point in 2008.

00:32:22.841 --> 00:32:28.380 align:middle line:84%
And I brought him up here
because he essentially rises

00:32:28.380 --> 00:32:32.217 align:middle line:84%
to the surface of public
consciousness right

00:32:32.217 --> 00:32:34.686 align:middle line:84%
around the time Pluto and
Capricorn comes into effect.

00:32:34.686 --> 00:32:36.555 align:middle line:84%
He's talking about
the Federal Reserve.

00:32:36.555 --> 00:32:38.057 align:middle line:84%
He's talking about
being conservative.

00:32:38.057 --> 00:32:39.825 align:middle line:90%
He's talking about not spending.

00:32:39.825 --> 00:32:42.694 align:middle line:84%
These are, again, all
very Cancerian traits.

00:32:42.694 --> 00:32:45.197 align:middle line:84%
Right? Cancer, they
are into saving.

00:32:45.197 --> 00:32:47.666 align:middle line:84%
They are into conserving;
whereas Pluto and Capricorn

00:32:47.666 --> 00:32:50.903 align:middle line:84%
or Capricorn in general loves
banking, loves to borrow,

00:32:50.903 --> 00:32:54.740 align:middle line:84%
loves to use the money, loves
to borrow money to make money,

00:32:54.740 --> 00:32:57.342 align:middle line:90%
and Ron Paul was not that.

00:32:57.342 --> 00:32:59.711 align:middle line:84%
And he became, again,
popular during that time,

00:32:59.711 --> 00:33:03.215 align:middle line:84%
and he kicks off the Tea
Party, for better or worse,

00:33:03.215 --> 00:33:07.719 align:middle line:84%
which is again kind of this
fifth column, sort of, you know,

00:33:07.719 --> 00:33:12.858 align:middle line:84%
running against this Pluto and
Capricornian sort of tyranny

00:33:12.858 --> 00:33:15.561 align:middle line:90%
and corpocratic matrix.

00:33:15.561 --> 00:33:18.764 align:middle line:84%
So that's essentially, you
know, the run-through with Pluto

00:33:18.764 --> 00:33:20.732 align:middle line:84%
and Capricorn and
where we are right now.

00:33:20.732 --> 00:33:23.235 align:middle line:90%
Obamacare is teetering.

00:33:23.235 --> 00:33:23.902 align:middle line:90%
It's tottering.

00:33:23.902 --> 00:33:25.003 align:middle line:90%
It's off the wheels.

00:33:25.003 --> 00:33:26.705 align:middle line:84%
It will be interesting
to see what happens

00:33:26.705 --> 00:33:29.374 align:middle line:84%
and how corporate
America comes in

00:33:29.374 --> 00:33:31.577 align:middle line:90%
and probably will save the day

00:33:31.577 --> 00:33:34.346 align:middle line:84%
with Obamacare whether
you like it or not.

00:33:34.346 --> 00:33:36.615 align:middle line:84%
It will be more corporate
and less government.

00:33:36.615 --> 00:33:40.252 align:middle line:84%
And it won't really look like
what it is or what we're trying

00:33:40.252 --> 00:33:41.653 align:middle line:90%
to experience right now.

00:33:41.653 --> 00:33:47.960 align:middle line:84%
But it will continue to evolve
and mutate and actually be more

00:33:47.960 --> 00:33:50.395 align:middle line:84%
like a business probably
over the course

00:33:50.395 --> 00:33:51.864 align:middle line:90%
of the next couple years.

00:33:51.864 --> 00:33:56.068 align:middle line:84%
We've got two squares with Pluto
and Uranus coming up next year.

00:33:56.068 --> 00:33:57.569 align:middle line:84%
And whenever we get
into these squares,

00:33:57.569 --> 00:33:58.770 align:middle line:90%
what are we dealing with?

00:33:58.770 --> 00:34:01.473 align:middle line:84%
Uranus in Aries is the
spirit of the individual.

00:34:01.473 --> 00:34:03.408 align:middle line:84%
You know, we could look
at the color revolutions

00:34:03.408 --> 00:34:05.878 align:middle line:84%
and say they might have been
a manifestation of Uranus

00:34:05.878 --> 00:34:08.613 align:middle line:84%
and Aries and it's always
up against this Pluto

00:34:08.613 --> 00:34:12.450 align:middle line:84%
and Capricornian force
which essentially wants

00:34:12.450 --> 00:34:19.291 align:middle line:84%
to bring people into one
umbrella, one model, one order.

00:34:19.291 --> 00:34:22.126 align:middle line:84%
Okay, well, that's it
for today's episode

00:34:22.126 --> 00:34:24.062 align:middle line:84%
of The Eleventh House
-- Pluto and Capricorn.

00:34:24.062 --> 00:34:25.397 align:middle line:90%
I hope you enjoyed it.

00:34:25.397 --> 00:34:28.066 align:middle line:84%
This is Robert Phoenix, and
join me on the next episode

00:34:28.066 --> 00:34:31.036 align:middle line:84%
where we get into Aquarius,
the spirit of Aquarius

00:34:31.036 --> 00:34:33.305 align:middle line:84%
and the rebellious
nature of Aquarius.

00:34:33.305 --> 00:34:34.807 align:middle line:90%
Thanks again.

00:34:34.807 --> 00:34:35.807 align:middle line:90%
