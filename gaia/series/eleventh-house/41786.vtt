00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.070 align:middle line:90%
>> Hi, there.

00:00:03.070 --> 00:00:05.840 align:middle line:90%
This is Robert Phoenix.

00:00:05.840 --> 00:00:08.409 align:middle line:84%
Welcome back to the
Eleventh House.

00:00:08.409 --> 00:00:11.212 align:middle line:84%
And today we're going to
be talking about Russia.

00:00:11.212 --> 00:00:17.585 align:middle line:84%
Yes the astrology of Russia, and
mostly for the coming year 2014,

00:00:17.585 --> 00:00:19.820 align:middle line:84%
but we're going to be looking
at some other elements as well,

00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:23.824 align:middle line:84%
especially Russia's relationship
with the United States.

00:00:23.824 --> 00:00:28.195 align:middle line:84%
We seem to be these big twins
trudging around the planets,

00:00:28.195 --> 00:00:31.031 align:middle line:84%
sort of bumping into each
other throughout the course

00:00:31.031 --> 00:00:33.100 align:middle line:84%
of the 20th and the
21st century.

00:00:33.100 --> 00:00:35.336 align:middle line:90%
So let's get into this and kind

00:00:35.336 --> 00:00:37.638 align:middle line:84%
of get a geographical
sense of Russia.

00:00:37.638 --> 00:00:40.741 align:middle line:84%
It's big. I think it
originally had 9 time zones.

00:00:40.741 --> 00:00:43.010 align:middle line:84%
I think it's down
to about 5 or 6 now,

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:46.013 align:middle line:84%
since they've peeled off
some of the states,

00:00:46.013 --> 00:00:48.282 align:middle line:90%
the stands, but there it is.

00:00:48.282 --> 00:00:51.952 align:middle line:84%
It's massive, and we're going
to be also looking at some

00:00:51.952 --> 00:00:56.490 align:middle line:84%
of this area down here,
Kazakhstan, Ukraine, Chechnya,

00:00:56.490 --> 00:01:00.861 align:middle line:84%
Volgograd, Sochi -- very
important part of 2014.

00:01:00.861 --> 00:01:03.130 align:middle line:90%
So there's your visual Russia.

00:01:03.130 --> 00:01:06.734 align:middle line:84%
It's big. Now, one of
the earliest connections

00:01:06.734 --> 00:01:09.437 align:middle line:84%
between the United States
and Russia takes place

00:01:09.437 --> 00:01:13.541 align:middle line:84%
between Abraham Lincoln
and the Czar Alexander,

00:01:13.541 --> 00:01:16.343 align:middle line:84%
and this is during the
time of the Civil War.

00:01:16.343 --> 00:01:20.848 align:middle line:84%
And Lincoln needed to fund
the army, the northern army

00:01:20.848 --> 00:01:26.020 align:middle line:84%
against the south, and
what he did is he decided

00:01:26.020 --> 00:01:27.488 align:middle line:90%
to print his own money.

00:01:27.488 --> 00:01:30.558 align:middle line:84%
And this is where we get
the whole concept and idea

00:01:30.558 --> 00:01:32.726 align:middle line:84%
and the printing
of the greenback,

00:01:32.726 --> 00:01:35.563 align:middle line:84%
the American greenback, which
is sort of the inception

00:01:35.563 --> 00:01:36.931 align:middle line:90%
of the American dollar.

00:01:36.931 --> 00:01:39.867 align:middle line:84%
And in order to do that what
Lincoln did is he disconnected

00:01:39.867 --> 00:01:41.669 align:middle line:90%
from the Central Banking system,

00:01:41.669 --> 00:01:43.871 align:middle line:84%
and of course the
Central Banking families,

00:01:43.871 --> 00:01:47.308 align:middle line:84%
led by the Rothchilds,
weren't too happy about that,

00:01:47.308 --> 00:01:50.878 align:middle line:84%
because they wanted the United
States to be beholden to them,

00:01:50.878 --> 00:01:55.815 align:middle line:84%
borrow money from them and
thus run up a significant debt

00:01:55.815 --> 00:01:57.151 align:middle line:90%
to fund their war effort.

00:01:57.151 --> 00:02:01.255 align:middle line:84%
But Lincoln being the
Aquarius that he was decided

00:02:01.255 --> 00:02:03.524 align:middle line:84%
that he wasn't going to
play ball and decided

00:02:03.524 --> 00:02:05.292 align:middle line:84%
to print his own
money as a result.

00:02:05.292 --> 00:02:09.496 align:middle line:84%
Now, the Rothchilds were
thinking about getting involved

00:02:09.496 --> 00:02:11.632 align:middle line:90%
and mounting some kind

00:02:11.632 --> 00:02:14.768 align:middle line:84%
of counter insurgency
as a result of this.

00:02:14.768 --> 00:02:17.404 align:middle line:84%
I'm not sure who they were
going to hire out for that,

00:02:17.404 --> 00:02:19.506 align:middle line:84%
but the United States was
vulnerable at that time.

00:02:19.506 --> 00:02:21.475 align:middle line:84%
We were fighting
amongst ourselves.

00:02:21.475 --> 00:02:23.811 align:middle line:84%
So they were angry, they
were trying to figure

00:02:23.811 --> 00:02:27.781 align:middle line:84%
out what they were going to do
in order to get back at Lincoln

00:02:27.781 --> 00:02:30.150 align:middle line:84%
and have some form
of retribution,

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:33.020 align:middle line:90%
but Alexander decided to step in

00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:36.223 align:middle line:84%
and what he did is he
positioned ships off the coast

00:02:36.223 --> 00:02:39.093 align:middle line:84%
of the United States,
which kept,

00:02:39.093 --> 00:02:42.296 align:middle line:84%
theoretically kept,
other parties at bay.

00:02:42.296 --> 00:02:44.765 align:middle line:84%
Now, there are some
people, some historians

00:02:44.765 --> 00:02:48.335 align:middle line:84%
in the alternative
history realm or world,

00:02:48.335 --> 00:02:51.539 align:middle line:84%
who believe that it was
that act of standing

00:02:51.539 --> 00:02:55.442 align:middle line:84%
up for the United States and
protecting Lincoln that led

00:02:55.442 --> 00:02:58.846 align:middle line:84%
to the removal of the
Czar and the start

00:02:58.846 --> 00:03:04.785 align:middle line:84%
of the Bolshevik Revolution that
the Rothchilds and other forces

00:03:04.785 --> 00:03:06.320 align:middle line:90%
that wanted to take hold

00:03:06.320 --> 00:03:11.926 align:middle line:84%
of Russia's vast natural
resources were spurred on

00:03:11.926 --> 00:03:13.928 align:middle line:90%
and catalyzed by this moment.

00:03:13.928 --> 00:03:16.195 align:middle line:84%
So this is kind of
an interesting

00:03:16.195 --> 00:03:19.133 align:middle line:90%
and important relationship early

00:03:19.133 --> 00:03:23.203 align:middle line:84%
on between the United
States and Russia.

00:03:23.203 --> 00:03:24.805 align:middle line:90%
Now, here is the new Czar.

00:03:24.805 --> 00:03:26.740 align:middle line:90%
This is Vladimir Putin.

00:03:26.740 --> 00:03:29.677 align:middle line:84%
He looks like a villain
out of James Bond:

00:03:29.677 --> 00:03:32.513 align:middle line:84%
the international man
of mystery, Putin.

00:03:32.513 --> 00:03:35.783 align:middle line:84%
And we're going to look at his
chart and we're going to look

00:03:35.783 --> 00:03:39.620 align:middle line:84%
at Russia's chart from
1991, December 25,

00:03:39.620 --> 00:03:43.123 align:middle line:84%
1991 is where we have
the new chart for Russia.

00:03:43.123 --> 00:03:46.694 align:middle line:84%
That's when the new government
of Russia came into play. We're

00:03:46.694 --> 00:03:49.763 align:middle line:84%
going to look at those charts
side by side, and you're going

00:03:49.763 --> 00:03:51.799 align:middle line:84%
to find that there's some really
interesting correlations

00:03:51.799 --> 00:03:52.833 align:middle line:90%
between the two.

00:03:52.833 --> 00:03:54.034 align:middle line:90%
Here they are side by side.

00:03:54.034 --> 00:03:56.637 align:middle line:84%
On the far right,
this is Putin's chart

00:03:56.637 --> 00:03:59.273 align:middle line:84%
and on the near right,
this is Russia's chart.

00:03:59.273 --> 00:04:02.142 align:middle line:84%
Now, one of the things that's
fascinating about Putin's chart.

00:04:02.142 --> 00:04:06.347 align:middle line:84%
He was born on October 7,
1952, which makes him a Libra.

00:04:06.347 --> 00:04:10.484 align:middle line:84%
He's got a stellium of
planets in Libra and he happens

00:04:10.484 --> 00:04:14.855 align:middle line:84%
to be a Scorpio rising,
how about that?

00:04:14.855 --> 00:04:18.025 align:middle line:84%
But here we have the sun
in Saturn and Neptune

00:04:18.025 --> 00:04:20.928 align:middle line:84%
and Mercury all in the twelfth
house, and the Twelfth House,

00:04:20.928 --> 00:04:24.498 align:middle line:84%
traditionally in astrology,
represents things like prisons,

00:04:24.498 --> 00:04:29.036 align:middle line:84%
mental institutions,
monasteries, temples, nunneries.

00:04:29.036 --> 00:04:32.339 align:middle line:84%
It's all these social
institutions that we can't see,

00:04:32.339 --> 00:04:34.208 align:middle line:90%
hidden away from our eyes.

00:04:34.208 --> 00:04:36.076 align:middle line:84%
Well, that's one level
of interpretation

00:04:36.076 --> 00:04:37.378 align:middle line:90%
from the Twelfth House.

00:04:37.378 --> 00:04:39.079 align:middle line:84%
Another level for
the interpretation

00:04:39.079 --> 00:04:42.016 align:middle line:84%
of the Twelfth House is
something more deeper,

00:04:42.016 --> 00:04:46.787 align:middle line:84%
more cosmic, more profound,
more metaphysic, more esoteric,

00:04:46.787 --> 00:04:48.422 align:middle line:90%
it's the ocean of consciousness

00:04:48.422 --> 00:04:50.190 align:middle line:84%
and that's what the
Twelfth House is.

00:04:50.190 --> 00:04:53.160 align:middle line:84%
It is the house that
connects us back to our soul.

00:04:53.160 --> 00:04:55.663 align:middle line:84%
And when somebody has
planets in the Twelfth House,

00:04:55.663 --> 00:04:59.533 align:middle line:84%
we can't easily see the impact
of those planets in the life

00:04:59.533 --> 00:05:02.836 align:middle line:84%
of the individual, and sometimes
even the individual themselves

00:05:02.836 --> 00:05:05.172 align:middle line:84%
can't even see the
impact of those planets.

00:05:05.172 --> 00:05:09.476 align:middle line:84%
It's as if there is a deep
sea vent in the consciousness

00:05:09.476 --> 00:05:11.845 align:middle line:84%
or in the psyche
and those planets,

00:05:11.845 --> 00:05:14.982 align:middle line:84%
the energy of those planets
rises up into the individual

00:05:14.982 --> 00:05:16.717 align:middle line:90%
and moves the individual.

00:05:16.717 --> 00:05:20.421 align:middle line:84%
People that have Twelfth House
planets are inside out people.

00:05:20.421 --> 00:05:23.157 align:middle line:84%
They live from deep
inside their own character

00:05:23.157 --> 00:05:25.392 align:middle line:90%
and their own nature, motivated

00:05:25.392 --> 00:05:28.561 align:middle line:84%
by something the rest
of us cannot see.

00:05:28.561 --> 00:05:30.798 align:middle line:84%
So this is really what's
taking place in Putin's chart

00:05:30.798 --> 00:05:32.266 align:middle line:90%
over here in the Twelfth House.

00:05:32.266 --> 00:05:34.902 align:middle line:84%
Now, you'll notice that
he has Saturn in Libra.

00:05:34.902 --> 00:05:37.171 align:middle line:90%
Saturn is exalted in Libra.

00:05:37.171 --> 00:05:41.141 align:middle line:84%
Libra is the sign of
peacemaking and mediation,

00:05:41.141 --> 00:05:45.612 align:middle line:84%
so with this stellium of
Libra planets Putin really is

00:05:45.612 --> 00:05:46.880 align:middle line:90%
a peacemaker.

00:05:46.880 --> 00:05:50.451 align:middle line:84%
And we saw some of those
behind-the-scenes peacemaking

00:05:50.451 --> 00:05:55.122 align:middle line:84%
tactics taking place or
take place not long ago.

00:05:55.122 --> 00:06:00.360 align:middle line:84%
The United States was ready
to go to war with Syria,

00:06:00.360 --> 00:06:06.333 align:middle line:84%
and what happened was that Putin
seized upon the fact that Kerry,

00:06:06.333 --> 00:06:10.237 align:middle line:84%
John Kerry, had said something
to the effect of well,

00:06:10.237 --> 00:06:17.711 align:middle line:84%
if Syria could give its chemical
supplies for their gas weapons

00:06:17.711 --> 00:06:20.247 align:middle line:84%
over to the UN or over
to the United States,

00:06:20.247 --> 00:06:22.149 align:middle line:84%
that might make some
kind of difference.

00:06:22.149 --> 00:06:26.487 align:middle line:84%
Well, Putin seized on that
and what happened was was

00:06:26.487 --> 00:06:27.888 align:middle line:90%
that a deal was struck.

00:06:27.888 --> 00:06:31.458 align:middle line:84%
And basically the Syrians said,
we'll hand over what we have,

00:06:31.458 --> 00:06:34.261 align:middle line:84%
just stay out of our
affairs and let us deal

00:06:34.261 --> 00:06:37.698 align:middle line:84%
with our so-called
rebels or insurrectionists.

00:06:37.698 --> 00:06:41.902 align:middle line:84%
So what Putin did with
Libra and all these planets

00:06:41.902 --> 00:06:46.974 align:middle line:84%
in the Twelfth House is he did
a behind-the-scenes back door

00:06:46.974 --> 00:06:50.878 align:middle line:90%
mediation peacemaking deal.

00:06:50.878 --> 00:06:54.715 align:middle line:84%
So this is the genius in some
ways, of Putin's Twelfth House,

00:06:54.715 --> 00:06:58.819 align:middle line:84%
but it still doesn't give
us a sense as to who he is.

00:06:58.819 --> 00:07:00.754 align:middle line:90%
Is he an Orthodox?

00:07:00.754 --> 00:07:01.722 align:middle line:90%
Is he a Zionist?

00:07:01.722 --> 00:07:02.589 align:middle line:90%
Is he a Communist?

00:07:02.589 --> 00:07:03.891 align:middle line:90%
Is he a capitalist?

00:07:03.891 --> 00:07:05.125 align:middle line:90%
Who is this guy?

00:07:05.125 --> 00:07:06.493 align:middle line:90%
We don't really know.

00:07:06.493 --> 00:07:10.597 align:middle line:84%
Why? Because most of his chart
is hidden behind the curtain

00:07:10.597 --> 00:07:11.698 align:middle line:90%
of the Twelfth House.

00:07:11.698 --> 00:07:14.334 align:middle line:84%
Neptune in the twelfth
house indicates

00:07:14.334 --> 00:07:18.505 align:middle line:84%
that he is also a natural born
mystic, that there is something

00:07:18.505 --> 00:07:22.409 align:middle line:84%
on a religious level that
motivates Putin from a very,

00:07:22.409 --> 00:07:26.380 align:middle line:84%
very deep place, and
we can see this perhaps

00:07:26.380 --> 00:07:31.485 align:middle line:84%
through his affiliation with the
Orthodox Church and his devotion

00:07:31.485 --> 00:07:33.487 align:middle line:90%
to the Orthodox Church.

00:07:33.487 --> 00:07:36.924 align:middle line:84%
Now, he also has Venus in
Scorpio in the 1st House

00:07:36.924 --> 00:07:38.625 align:middle line:90%
and Venus and Scorpio's intense.

00:07:38.625 --> 00:07:40.194 align:middle line:84%
People who have Venus
and Scorpio,

00:07:40.194 --> 00:07:42.963 align:middle line:84%
they love intensely,
they hate intensely.

00:07:42.963 --> 00:07:47.367 align:middle line:84%
If you are in their circle of
trust you're in their circle

00:07:47.367 --> 00:07:51.672 align:middle line:84%
of trust for life, and if
you're not well, good luck.

00:07:51.672 --> 00:07:57.044 align:middle line:84%
But he's got Venus in Scorpio,
he's got a trine with that Venus

00:07:57.044 --> 00:08:01.081 align:middle line:84%
to Uranus in Cancer
up in the Ninth House.

00:08:01.081 --> 00:08:03.283 align:middle line:84%
So that's a really
interesting trine,

00:08:03.283 --> 00:08:05.452 align:middle line:84%
and it can be a really
catalytic trine.

00:08:05.452 --> 00:08:09.423 align:middle line:84%
He can be a very exciting,
very dynamic individual,

00:08:09.423 --> 00:08:11.625 align:middle line:84%
at least that's how people
see him, and you know,

00:08:11.625 --> 00:08:15.329 align:middle line:84%
Putin has a really strong
relationship with people

00:08:15.329 --> 00:08:18.599 align:middle line:84%
in the United States,
mostly conservative people.

00:08:18.599 --> 00:08:21.902 align:middle line:84%
People that are of the
conservative stride see Putin

00:08:21.902 --> 00:08:24.738 align:middle line:84%
as the anti-Obama,
and we're going to get

00:08:24.738 --> 00:08:27.407 align:middle line:84%
into this a little bit when
we get into the shifting

00:08:27.407 --> 00:08:29.442 align:middle line:84%
of the Sun's poles and some
of the other stuff we're going

00:08:29.442 --> 00:08:32.112 align:middle line:84%
to look at, but he's
like the anti-Obama.

00:08:32.112 --> 00:08:35.549 align:middle line:84%
Putin is a man of action,
he's a man of integrity.

00:08:35.549 --> 00:08:40.354 align:middle line:84%
He's not afraid to stand up for
what he believes, and he stands

00:08:40.354 --> 00:08:42.055 align:middle line:84%
by the Church, the
Orthodox Church,

00:08:42.055 --> 00:08:45.225 align:middle line:84%
He is protecting the rights
of children when it comes

00:08:45.225 --> 00:08:50.330 align:middle line:84%
to what some people would call
gay or homosexual propaganda.

00:08:50.330 --> 00:08:55.035 align:middle line:84%
So this is the idea or the
ideal of Putin in this country,

00:08:55.035 --> 00:08:57.371 align:middle line:84%
conservative Americans
like Putin.

00:08:57.371 --> 00:09:00.574 align:middle line:84%
Conservative Americans don't
like Obama because in a lot

00:09:00.574 --> 00:09:03.210 align:middle line:84%
of ways, they see
Obama as a socialist.

00:09:03.210 --> 00:09:06.680 align:middle line:84%
So here we have this really
interesting juxtaposition of

00:09:06.680 --> 00:09:11.919 align:middle line:84%
Putin, a Russian, as perhaps
a capitalist conservative,

00:09:11.919 --> 00:09:14.187 align:middle line:90%
and Obama as an American,

00:09:14.187 --> 00:09:17.624 align:middle line:84%
as this progressive
socialist, communist.

00:09:17.624 --> 00:09:19.760 align:middle line:84%
So this is really
fascinating and this gets back

00:09:19.760 --> 00:09:21.762 align:middle line:90%
to this interesting relationship

00:09:21.762 --> 00:09:23.864 align:middle line:84%
between the United
States and Russia.

00:09:23.864 --> 00:09:27.000 align:middle line:84%
Now, here we have
Venus trining Uranus,

00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:30.470 align:middle line:84%
but we also have these planets
over here squaring Uranus,

00:09:30.470 --> 00:09:34.975 align:middle line:84%
so we're in a cardinal square
here with Libra and with Cancer,

00:09:34.975 --> 00:09:37.177 align:middle line:84%
How does this cardinal
square manifest?

00:09:37.177 --> 00:09:39.513 align:middle line:84%
Well, just as the
conservative community

00:09:39.513 --> 00:09:42.983 align:middle line:84%
in this country likes
Putin and sees him

00:09:42.983 --> 00:09:47.421 align:middle line:84%
in an almost heroic light,
the progressive community

00:09:47.421 --> 00:09:50.424 align:middle line:84%
in this country, well, they
don't like him quite nearly

00:09:50.424 --> 00:09:56.763 align:middle line:84%
as much, so as a result
of how Russia has decided

00:09:56.763 --> 00:10:02.202 align:middle line:84%
to limit the type of exposure
that young Russians have

00:10:02.202 --> 00:10:08.475 align:middle line:84%
with the gay or LGBT lifestyle,
most Americans view Russia

00:10:08.475 --> 00:10:13.547 align:middle line:84%
and Putin as being hateful and
not having very much tolerance.

00:10:13.547 --> 00:10:15.782 align:middle line:84%
And that includes the
President, by the way,

00:10:15.782 --> 00:10:19.019 align:middle line:84%
because the President is
sending Billie Jean King

00:10:19.019 --> 00:10:22.756 align:middle line:84%
and some openly gay
athletes to Russia

00:10:22.756 --> 00:10:27.227 align:middle line:84%
to represent the United States
in the 2014 Olympics in Sochi.

00:10:27.227 --> 00:10:28.894 align:middle line:90%
So here we have the square.

00:10:28.894 --> 00:10:33.967 align:middle line:84%
So we have the sympathetic
angle with the trine,

00:10:33.967 --> 00:10:36.603 align:middle line:84%
and now we have the square,
which is the hard angle.

00:10:36.603 --> 00:10:40.741 align:middle line:84%
So we see both of these
aspects between cancer

00:10:40.741 --> 00:10:45.245 align:middle line:84%
and Putin's First House and his
Twelfth House getting played

00:10:45.245 --> 00:10:47.581 align:middle line:84%
out in his chart --
really fascinating stuff.

00:10:47.581 --> 00:10:51.184 align:middle line:84%
Now, Putin also has Mars
in Sagittarius down here

00:10:51.184 --> 00:10:54.521 align:middle line:84%
in the Second House, and of
course Sagittarius rules,

00:10:54.521 --> 00:10:56.957 align:middle line:84%
sports, outdoors
activities, so you're going

00:10:56.957 --> 00:10:59.693 align:middle line:84%
to see him riding
a horse, fishing.

00:10:59.693 --> 00:11:01.695 align:middle line:84%
He's also a black
belt Judo, by the way.

00:11:01.695 --> 00:11:02.896 align:middle line:90%
He's a tough guy.

00:11:02.896 --> 00:11:06.366 align:middle line:84%
Mars in Sagittarius,
26 degrees,

00:11:06.366 --> 00:11:09.102 align:middle line:84%
so that's just 2 degrees
off of the galactic center,

00:11:09.102 --> 00:11:11.238 align:middle line:84%
which means that Putin
is the type of guy

00:11:11.238 --> 00:11:12.973 align:middle line:90%
that has a sense of the moment.

00:11:12.973 --> 00:11:15.776 align:middle line:84%
He has an understanding
as to where he needs

00:11:15.776 --> 00:11:17.577 align:middle line:90%
to be, what he needs to do.

00:11:17.577 --> 00:11:20.547 align:middle line:84%
There's kind of an almost
a celestial directive

00:11:20.547 --> 00:11:24.117 align:middle line:84%
in his chart here, especially
with the trine with Pluto,

00:11:24.117 --> 00:11:26.820 align:middle line:84%
so Mars-Pluto trine,
he's a serious character.

00:11:26.820 --> 00:11:29.856 align:middle line:84%
He can endure a lot, he's got
a lot of personal strength,

00:11:29.856 --> 00:11:32.893 align:middle line:84%
a lot of personal power
with the Mars trine,

00:11:32.893 --> 00:11:36.296 align:middle line:84%
Down in the Third House,
it gets really interesting.

00:11:36.296 --> 00:11:38.165 align:middle line:84%
He's got his true
node in Aquarius.

00:11:38.165 --> 00:11:40.534 align:middle line:90%
Now, Aquarius here opposes Leo,

00:11:40.534 --> 00:11:43.136 align:middle line:84%
so what we have is we
have the polar opposition

00:11:43.136 --> 00:11:47.174 align:middle line:84%
between essentially
royalty and the bourgeoisie,

00:11:47.174 --> 00:11:50.010 align:middle line:84%
Leo and the proletarian,
Aquarius down here.

00:11:50.010 --> 00:11:54.514 align:middle line:84%
So we see this dynamic getting
played out, this opposition

00:11:54.514 --> 00:11:59.119 align:middle line:84%
between royalty and power and
this explosive dynamic energy

00:11:59.119 --> 00:12:00.620 align:middle line:84%
of something new
wanting to come

00:12:00.620 --> 00:12:02.222 align:middle line:84%
up with something
more democratic,

00:12:02.222 --> 00:12:03.857 align:middle line:90%
something more revolutionary.

00:12:03.857 --> 00:12:06.893 align:middle line:84%
He's got this in his
chart, and ultimately

00:12:06.893 --> 00:12:11.731 align:middle line:84%
because the true node I believe
is the truth north of the chart,

00:12:11.731 --> 00:12:16.136 align:middle line:84%
Putin will become a more
Aquarian character over time,

00:12:16.136 --> 00:12:20.640 align:middle line:84%
especially when Pluto
moves to Aquarius

00:12:20.640 --> 00:12:22.943 align:middle line:84%
after it makes his run
through in Capricorn.

00:12:22.943 --> 00:12:26.947 align:middle line:84%
But here, Uranus and the
true node are squared off

00:12:26.947 --> 00:12:31.117 align:middle line:84%
against Jupiter in Taurus,
which is also exalted,

00:12:31.117 --> 00:12:33.753 align:middle line:84%
by the way, in the
Seventh House.

00:12:33.753 --> 00:12:37.757 align:middle line:84%
So the arbiter between these
two is Jupiter, Taurus, Earth,

00:12:37.757 --> 00:12:43.263 align:middle line:84%
grounding, trying to find the
sweet spot between the kind

00:12:43.263 --> 00:12:46.199 align:middle line:84%
of the rule of the
Kane, the rule of law,

00:12:46.199 --> 00:12:48.802 align:middle line:84%
the rule of the people, it
really comes down to Jupiter

00:12:48.802 --> 00:12:51.905 align:middle line:84%
in Taurus, which is what's good
for the land or what's good

00:12:51.905 --> 00:12:55.141 align:middle line:84%
for the country or
what's good for sort

00:12:55.141 --> 00:12:58.178 align:middle line:90%
of the soil of our ancestry.

00:12:58.178 --> 00:13:01.581 align:middle line:84%
That's where this all gets
mediated through his chart.

00:13:01.581 --> 00:13:04.251 align:middle line:84%
He also has friends in high
places, very wealthy friends,

00:13:04.251 --> 00:13:06.653 align:middle line:84%
by the way, with
Jupiter in Taurus.

00:13:06.653 --> 00:13:09.422 align:middle line:84%
He's got moon and Gemini
in the Eighth House.

00:13:09.422 --> 00:13:12.325 align:middle line:84%
Now, the Eighth House is
the hidden reputed house,

00:13:12.325 --> 00:13:13.693 align:middle line:90%
just like the Twelfth House.

00:13:13.693 --> 00:13:16.696 align:middle line:84%
The Twelfth House, natural ruler
is Pisces, the natural ruler

00:13:16.696 --> 00:13:20.100 align:middle line:84%
of the Eighth House is Scorpio,
so we don't really understand

00:13:20.100 --> 00:13:22.736 align:middle line:84%
or see what Putin's feeling
on an emotional level

00:13:22.736 --> 00:13:25.071 align:middle line:84%
because his mood his
hidden here in the Eighth,

00:13:25.071 --> 00:13:29.876 align:middle line:84%
and it's in Gemini, which
gives him two potential points

00:13:29.876 --> 00:13:31.678 align:middle line:90%
of emotional contact.

00:13:31.678 --> 00:13:35.615 align:middle line:84%
So we don't really fully
understand what he's feeling

00:13:35.615 --> 00:13:39.319 align:middle line:84%
or what he's thinking at any
given time because almost half

00:13:39.319 --> 00:13:43.890 align:middle line:84%
of his chart is submerged in the
Eighth and the Twelfth Houses.

00:13:43.890 --> 00:13:45.959 align:middle line:84%
Let's move over to the
chart of Russia here

00:13:45.959 --> 00:13:47.661 align:middle line:90%
and find some correspondences.

00:13:47.661 --> 00:13:49.162 align:middle line:84%
One of the first things
that you'll notice

00:13:49.162 --> 00:13:52.232 align:middle line:84%
if you've been paying
attention is that Russia --

00:13:52.232 --> 00:13:56.436 align:middle line:84%
this is the chart of Russia,
which is created on the 25th

00:13:56.436 --> 00:14:05.512 align:middle line:84%
of December 1991, is that Russia
has an ascendant of 21 Leo.

00:14:06.212 --> 00:14:07.347 align:middle line:90%
Where is Putin's Pluto?

00:14:07.347 --> 00:14:10.250 align:middle line:84%
It is at 22 Leo, which
places his Pluto right

00:14:10.250 --> 00:14:11.484 align:middle line:90%
on the ascendant of Russia.

00:14:11.484 --> 00:14:14.387 align:middle line:84%
By the way, I got the charts
out of Astrology Weekly,

00:14:14.387 --> 00:14:19.526 align:middle line:84%
so I'm using their charts and
their time for these examples.

00:14:19.526 --> 00:14:22.929 align:middle line:84%
So Putin's Pluto is right
on Russia's ascendant,

00:14:22.929 --> 00:14:28.034 align:middle line:84%
which means that he has
an extreme influence

00:14:28.034 --> 00:14:29.903 align:middle line:84%
over that entire
region with his Pluto.

00:14:29.903 --> 00:14:34.708 align:middle line:84%
Now, Pluto, it is a
transpersonal planet,

00:14:34.708 --> 00:14:38.011 align:middle line:84%
but nonetheless it's his
Pluto, it's his chart

00:14:38.011 --> 00:14:39.980 align:middle line:84%
and it's right there
on the Ascendant.

00:14:39.980 --> 00:14:43.450 align:middle line:84%
So the identity of Russia
at this point in time

00:14:43.450 --> 00:14:46.586 align:middle line:84%
until they have another
revolution, is synonymous

00:14:46.586 --> 00:14:50.390 align:middle line:84%
with the Pluto of Putin and his
own identity, which would be

00:14:50.390 --> 00:14:55.395 align:middle line:84%
by the way, that his Mars in
Sagittarius would be right

00:14:55.395 --> 00:14:58.898 align:middle line:84%
over where it says
-- right here --

00:14:58.898 --> 00:15:02.636 align:middle line:84%
and guess what, it's almost
conjunct Russia's Mars

00:15:02.636 --> 00:15:03.870 align:middle line:90%
in Sagittarius.

00:15:03.870 --> 00:15:08.241 align:middle line:84%
So not only his Pluto here
right on the Ascendant

00:15:08.241 --> 00:15:12.312 align:middle line:84%
but his own Mars, is 7 degree
conjunction is pretty close.

00:15:12.312 --> 00:15:14.514 align:middle line:84%
So they have a Mars-Mars
conjunction together,

00:15:14.514 --> 00:15:17.217 align:middle line:84%
and of course, Putin's
Pluto is on the Ascendant.

00:15:17.217 --> 00:15:21.454 align:middle line:84%
Now, we have Saturn
over here in Aquarius.

00:15:21.454 --> 00:15:24.791 align:middle line:84%
This is important for Russia,
by the way, Saturn in Aquarius,

00:15:24.791 --> 00:15:26.426 align:middle line:90%
and we have Putin's true node

00:15:26.426 --> 00:15:30.363 align:middle line:84%
in Aquarius. 19 degrees puts
it right here on the edge

00:15:30.363 --> 00:15:31.564 align:middle line:90%
of the Seventh House --

00:15:31.564 --> 00:15:32.832 align:middle line:84%
we're almost screening
it for the Seventh House,

00:15:32.832 --> 00:15:36.836 align:middle line:84%
may as well -- so Putin's
true node is over here

00:15:36.836 --> 00:15:40.040 align:middle line:84%
in the Seventh House,
which makes him a partner

00:15:40.040 --> 00:15:44.344 align:middle line:84%
and a key person in terms
of the overall relationship

00:15:44.344 --> 00:15:46.980 align:middle line:84%
with this chart --
very fascinating stuff.

00:15:46.980 --> 00:15:50.316 align:middle line:84%
Saturn and Aquarius in
the Sixth House is kind

00:15:50.316 --> 00:15:53.186 align:middle line:84%
of a karmic placement
here for Saturn.

00:15:53.186 --> 00:15:54.754 align:middle line:84%
Of course, the Russian
revolution,

00:15:54.754 --> 00:15:56.756 align:middle line:84%
the Bolshevik Revolution
took place

00:15:56.756 --> 00:15:58.958 align:middle line:90%
when Uranus was in Aquarius.

00:15:58.958 --> 00:16:03.563 align:middle line:84%
So Russia still has
some Aquarian energy

00:16:03.563 --> 00:16:05.031 align:middle line:90%
that it has to deal with.

00:16:05.031 --> 00:16:10.103 align:middle line:84%
It has to somehow come to
terms with sort of the blood

00:16:10.103 --> 00:16:14.774 align:middle line:84%
and the chaos and the tumult
of the Bolshevik Revolution

00:16:14.774 --> 00:16:23.850 align:middle line:84%
while not being completely shut
out or shut down by new ideas

00:16:23.850 --> 00:16:25.051 align:middle line:90%
or new technology

00:16:25.051 --> 00:16:28.221 align:middle line:84%
or new ways of seeing,
perceiving

00:16:28.221 --> 00:16:29.856 align:middle line:90%
and even governing itself.

00:16:29.856 --> 00:16:33.259 align:middle line:84%
It has to come to terms with it,
it has to come to grips with it.

00:16:33.259 --> 00:16:36.329 align:middle line:84%
And I think it'll happen
in the realm of technology

00:16:36.329 --> 00:16:38.898 align:middle line:84%
because the Sixth House
is the house of purpose,

00:16:38.898 --> 00:16:40.967 align:middle line:90%
service and work and health.

00:16:40.967 --> 00:16:44.237 align:middle line:84%
So I could see some very
interesting radical health

00:16:44.237 --> 00:16:47.307 align:middle line:84%
technologies coming out of
the former Soviet Union.

00:16:47.307 --> 00:16:49.809 align:middle line:84%
But what's really interesting
here is we've got all these

00:16:49.809 --> 00:16:53.680 align:middle line:84%
planets of Capricorn,
and the Soviet Union,

00:16:53.680 --> 00:16:57.350 align:middle line:84%
the former Soviet Union becomes
a very Capricornian country --

00:16:57.350 --> 00:17:01.488 align:middle line:84%
Sun in Capricorn, 3 degrees,
true node at 9 degrees, Uranus

00:17:01.488 --> 00:17:04.124 align:middle line:84%
at 13 degrees -- remember that
number, it's important --

00:17:04.124 --> 00:17:06.593 align:middle line:84%
and Neptune in Capricorn
as well.

00:17:06.593 --> 00:17:08.761 align:middle line:84%
That's four planets,
that's a stellian.

00:17:08.761 --> 00:17:14.701 align:middle line:84%
Now, you could look at we've
got 13 Uranus squaring off

00:17:14.701 --> 00:17:16.069 align:middle line:90%
of Putin's Sun.

00:17:16.069 --> 00:17:17.137 align:middle line:90%
That's dynamic.

00:17:17.137 --> 00:17:18.705 align:middle line:90%
Any time you get into a square,

00:17:18.705 --> 00:17:20.707 align:middle line:84%
people say squares
are bad in astrology.

00:17:20.707 --> 00:17:26.246 align:middle line:84%
They're hard, they're struggle
that you really have to push

00:17:26.246 --> 00:17:29.849 align:middle line:84%
against energy or
you have to push

00:17:29.849 --> 00:17:33.653 align:middle line:84%
against your own
inertia with squares.

00:17:33.653 --> 00:17:35.054 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes that's not a bad
thing.

00:17:35.054 --> 00:17:37.023 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes squares
can be really dynamic

00:17:37.023 --> 00:17:40.760 align:middle line:84%
and can really help a person
grow and develop character

00:17:40.760 --> 00:17:44.264 align:middle line:84%
and strength and dynamism
and get through periods

00:17:44.264 --> 00:17:48.001 align:middle line:84%
of their life where if they're
flat lining or backsliding,

00:17:48.001 --> 00:17:50.270 align:middle line:84%
the square could come in and
really challenge a person

00:17:50.270 --> 00:17:54.307 align:middle line:84%
to grow, so obviously there's a
really interesting square here

00:17:54.307 --> 00:17:58.578 align:middle line:84%
between this energy of Russia
which is very different in a lot

00:17:58.578 --> 00:18:01.581 align:middle line:90%
of ways than Putin's energy.

00:18:01.581 --> 00:18:04.083 align:middle line:84%
Even though his Pluto
is on the First House

00:18:04.083 --> 00:18:05.285 align:middle line:84%
and even though there's
a connection

00:18:05.285 --> 00:18:08.688 align:middle line:84%
between the Mars-Mars,
Aquarius and Aquarius,

00:18:08.688 --> 00:18:10.657 align:middle line:90%
there is a distinct difference.

00:18:10.657 --> 00:18:15.295 align:middle line:84%
Putin is ultimately a
win-win guy, and Russia,

00:18:15.295 --> 00:18:21.201 align:middle line:84%
based on the chart from 1991, is
all about Capricornian ascent,

00:18:21.201 --> 00:18:23.369 align:middle line:90%
and Capricornian rule.

00:18:23.369 --> 00:18:28.508 align:middle line:84%
And what's also fascinating
about this configuration is

00:18:28.508 --> 00:18:30.743 align:middle line:90%
that it opposes almost all

00:18:30.743 --> 00:18:33.613 align:middle line:84%
of the United States'
stellian and Cancer.

00:18:33.613 --> 00:18:36.049 align:middle line:84%
The United States is
a Cancerian country,

00:18:36.049 --> 00:18:39.018 align:middle line:84%
so here we have the opposition
between the United States

00:18:39.018 --> 00:18:41.287 align:middle line:84%
and Russia being played
out astrologically,

00:18:41.287 --> 00:18:43.590 align:middle line:90%
Capricorn versus Cancer.

00:18:43.590 --> 00:18:47.293 align:middle line:84%
So let's move on a little bit
here and get deeper into this.

00:18:47.293 --> 00:18:49.863 align:middle line:84%
This is the Sun and
this is an illustration

00:18:49.863 --> 00:18:51.664 align:middle line:90%
of the Sun's pole shifting.

00:18:51.664 --> 00:18:55.134 align:middle line:84%
Now, apparently they're
supposed to shift any day now,

00:18:55.134 --> 00:18:57.670 align:middle line:84%
and that doesn't mean that
the world is going to end.

00:18:57.670 --> 00:18:59.639 align:middle line:84%
This happens about
every 11 years or so,

00:18:59.639 --> 00:19:03.810 align:middle line:84%
and the last time it
happened was 2002.

00:19:03.810 --> 00:19:07.513 align:middle line:84%
So 2002 was also the last
time Jupiter was in Leo,

00:19:07.513 --> 00:19:09.849 align:middle line:90%
which is a Sun sign, by the way,

00:19:09.849 --> 00:19:12.752 align:middle line:84%
which is the sign
of the Sun, Leo.

00:19:12.752 --> 00:19:16.756 align:middle line:84%
This happened in
2002, and since 2002,

00:19:16.756 --> 00:19:18.491 align:middle line:84%
the world's been a
little topsy turvy.

00:19:18.491 --> 00:19:20.159 align:middle line:84%
I mean, we looked a
little bit earlier

00:19:20.159 --> 00:19:24.330 align:middle line:84%
about how Putin has become
this sort of figurehead

00:19:24.330 --> 00:19:28.902 align:middle line:84%
for the conservative
Intelligentsia in this country,

00:19:28.902 --> 00:19:31.771 align:middle line:84%
while Obama has become
a much more European,

00:19:31.771 --> 00:19:34.307 align:middle line:84%
international kind
of socialist figure.

00:19:34.307 --> 00:19:36.876 align:middle line:84%
That's part of this
topsy turvy kind

00:19:36.876 --> 00:19:41.314 align:middle line:84%
of polar shift that's taken
place here in this planet

00:19:41.314 --> 00:19:43.616 align:middle line:84%
as well, from a social
perspective.

00:19:43.616 --> 00:19:46.085 align:middle line:90%
So we can see this with the sun,

00:19:46.085 --> 00:19:47.754 align:middle line:84%
and the sun is about
to flip again.

00:19:47.754 --> 00:19:48.788 align:middle line:90%
So what does that mean?

00:19:48.788 --> 00:19:50.156 align:middle line:90%
Does that mean that we're going

00:19:50.156 --> 00:19:52.926 align:middle line:84%
to see the United States swing
back towards something more

00:19:52.926 --> 00:19:55.662 align:middle line:84%
conservative, is Russia
going to swing back

00:19:55.662 --> 00:19:59.599 align:middle line:84%
to something less conservative
and more towards its sort

00:19:59.599 --> 00:20:04.003 align:middle line:84%
of communitarian,
Aquarian, Uranian kind

00:20:04.003 --> 00:20:05.705 align:middle line:90%
of involutionary energy?

00:20:05.705 --> 00:20:09.776 align:middle line:84%
Well, time will tell, but
this is about to happen,

00:20:09.776 --> 00:20:13.646 align:middle line:84%
and will put us into
another 11-year cycle

00:20:13.646 --> 00:20:16.683 align:middle line:84%
where theoretically,
consciousness

00:20:16.683 --> 00:20:19.552 align:middle line:84%
and collective symbols
and everything associated

00:20:19.552 --> 00:20:21.988 align:middle line:84%
with this could have the
potential to shift as well.

00:20:21.988 --> 00:20:23.089 align:middle line:90%
Now, here we go.

00:20:23.089 --> 00:20:26.459 align:middle line:84%
Here's Venus trine
Uranus in action.

00:20:26.459 --> 00:20:29.896 align:middle line:84%
Remember, Putin has Venus in
Scorpio in the first house,

00:20:29.896 --> 00:20:32.732 align:middle line:84%
and Venus in Scorpio can
be a little tricky at times.

00:20:32.732 --> 00:20:37.904 align:middle line:84%
The man on my far
right is Robert Kraft,

00:20:37.904 --> 00:20:41.741 align:middle line:84%
and he is the owner of
the New England Patriots.

00:20:41.741 --> 00:20:46.346 align:middle line:84%
So he owns a football team
that is emblematic and symbolic

00:20:46.346 --> 00:20:48.548 align:middle line:90%
of America, the Patriots.

00:20:48.548 --> 00:20:53.119 align:middle line:84%
So he went to Russia in 2005,
and what he did is he met

00:20:53.119 --> 00:20:55.755 align:middle line:84%
with Russian business
leaders and he decided

00:20:55.755 --> 00:20:57.924 align:middle line:84%
to show Putin his
Super Bowl ring.

00:20:57.924 --> 00:20:59.592 align:middle line:90%
What did Putin do?

00:20:59.592 --> 00:21:03.062 align:middle line:84%
He put it on his finger
and he never gave it back.

00:21:03.062 --> 00:21:06.065 align:middle line:84%
He kept Bob Kraft's
Super Bowl ring.

00:21:06.065 --> 00:21:10.536 align:middle line:84%
Now, this is very interesting
because what happens here is

00:21:10.536 --> 00:21:14.874 align:middle line:84%
that Putin is making a
statement on so many levels.

00:21:14.874 --> 00:21:18.578 align:middle line:84%
First of all, he's making a
statement to Bob Kraft, saying,

00:21:18.578 --> 00:21:20.446 align:middle line:90%
I have more power than you.

00:21:20.446 --> 00:21:23.916 align:middle line:84%
I can take your ring which I
thought you were giving to me

00:21:23.916 --> 00:21:26.986 align:middle line:84%
as a gift -- very Venus
in Scorpio, by the way --

00:21:26.986 --> 00:21:29.222 align:middle line:84%
and I can hold it
and I can keep it.

00:21:29.222 --> 00:21:33.393 align:middle line:84%
That's number one, but also
the ring becomes a fetish,

00:21:33.393 --> 00:21:38.464 align:middle line:84%
it becomes a symbol, and Putin
is now channeling in a lot

00:21:38.464 --> 00:21:43.136 align:middle line:84%
of ways and stealing this
emblematic power of America,

00:21:43.136 --> 00:21:47.540 align:middle line:84%
the Super Bowl, the
Patriots, New England,

00:21:47.540 --> 00:21:51.611 align:middle line:84%
and perhaps as a result
there has been this sort

00:21:51.611 --> 00:21:56.749 align:middle line:84%
of tidal shift in some ways
towards Russia becoming more

00:21:56.749 --> 00:21:59.886 align:middle line:84%
conservative and perhaps even
more American to some extent.

00:21:59.886 --> 00:22:02.422 align:middle line:84%
It's a very interesting
moment, and by the way,

00:22:02.422 --> 00:22:04.357 align:middle line:84%
Bob Kraft still wants
his ring back.

00:22:04.357 --> 00:22:07.593 align:middle line:84%
I read a story the other day
where Putin said he's going

00:22:07.593 --> 00:22:10.530 align:middle line:84%
to give him a very nice
ring as a return gift,

00:22:10.530 --> 00:22:12.965 align:middle line:84%
but he won't give him his
Super Bowl ring back and oh,

00:22:12.965 --> 00:22:14.901 align:middle line:84%
by the way, the New
England Patriots,

00:22:14.901 --> 00:22:17.437 align:middle line:84%
they haven't won a
Super Bowl since.

00:22:17.437 --> 00:22:18.871 align:middle line:90%
Now, let's fast forward here.

00:22:18.871 --> 00:22:23.476 align:middle line:90%
This is a map of Volgograd,

00:22:23.476 --> 00:22:27.814 align:middle line:84%
and this is where the
terrorist attacks just recently

00:22:27.814 --> 00:22:28.881 align:middle line:90%
took place.

00:22:28.881 --> 00:22:31.918 align:middle line:84%
There were two of
them, one on the 29th

00:22:31.918 --> 00:22:33.486 align:middle line:90%
of December and one on the 30th.

00:22:33.486 --> 00:22:35.521 align:middle line:84%
This is right around
the Russian New Year.

00:22:35.521 --> 00:22:39.592 align:middle line:84%
It's also right around
the time of December 25th,

00:22:39.592 --> 00:22:41.994 align:middle line:84%
which is the birth
of the new Russia.

00:22:41.994 --> 00:22:45.164 align:middle line:84%
And these terror attacks, I
think there were 18 people

00:22:45.164 --> 00:22:47.300 align:middle line:84%
that died as a result
-- two separate ones --

00:22:47.300 --> 00:22:49.869 align:middle line:90%
train station, suicide bomber,

00:22:49.869 --> 00:22:52.238 align:middle line:84%
and they have been
loosely linked

00:22:52.238 --> 00:22:57.577 align:middle line:84%
to a radical Islamic
group out of Chechnya,

00:22:57.577 --> 00:23:02.415 align:middle line:84%
and this has taken place -- now,
this is all part of this region

00:23:02.415 --> 00:23:04.617 align:middle line:84%
which is really heating
up for Russia.

00:23:04.617 --> 00:23:07.587 align:middle line:84%
You've got Kazakhstan, you've
got Volgograd here which is

00:23:07.587 --> 00:23:12.625 align:middle line:84%
where these attacks took place,
Ukraine, where there's been lots

00:23:12.625 --> 00:23:17.029 align:middle line:84%
of protests and recently and
the Ukrainians, they want out.

00:23:17.029 --> 00:23:19.966 align:middle line:84%
They want out of Russia and they
want to join the European Union

00:23:19.966 --> 00:23:21.667 align:middle line:90%
and Russia won't let them go.

00:23:21.667 --> 00:23:23.469 align:middle line:84%
And then of course,
you have Sochi here

00:23:23.469 --> 00:23:24.670 align:middle line:84%
where the Olympics
are going to be,

00:23:24.670 --> 00:23:27.840 align:middle line:84%
and then of course Chechnya
over in this region.

00:23:27.840 --> 00:23:31.577 align:middle line:84%
So this is a really explosive,
dynamic and intense region.

00:23:31.577 --> 00:23:33.579 align:middle line:84%
This is where some of
the Aquarian energy

00:23:33.579 --> 00:23:36.816 align:middle line:84%
that I was talking about
earlier, is getting played

00:23:36.816 --> 00:23:40.386 align:middle line:84%
out for Russia, and in fact, the
Aquarian energy manifests

00:23:40.386 --> 00:23:43.322 align:middle line:84%
on February 7 and
the sign of Aquarius

00:23:43.322 --> 00:23:47.226 align:middle line:84%
when the start the Olympics in
Sochi, the Russian Olympics.

00:23:47.226 --> 00:23:49.428 align:middle line:84%
So I'm going to just
jump into a couple

00:23:49.428 --> 00:23:51.230 align:middle line:90%
of interesting symbols here.

00:23:51.230 --> 00:23:53.666 align:middle line:90%
This is the symbol of Volgograd.

00:23:53.666 --> 00:23:56.669 align:middle line:84%
This is one of the first
Coat of Arms for Volgograd.

00:23:56.669 --> 00:24:00.106 align:middle line:84%
We have two fish here that are
crossed, and then three fish

00:24:00.106 --> 00:24:02.175 align:middle line:84%
up here, Father,
Son, Holy Ghost,

00:24:02.175 --> 00:24:05.044 align:middle line:84%
and this is emblematic
of Pisces.

00:24:05.044 --> 00:24:07.446 align:middle line:90%
So we have this Piscian sort

00:24:07.446 --> 00:24:10.983 align:middle line:84%
of Christian very old
Christian imagery associated

00:24:10.983 --> 00:24:14.720 align:middle line:84%
with Volgograd, and what we
have recently is this is a very

00:24:14.720 --> 00:24:20.493 align:middle line:84%
explosive, very Uranian
radical energy taking place

00:24:20.493 --> 00:24:24.330 align:middle line:84%
in that area, so we have
this Piscian, Aquarian,

00:24:24.330 --> 00:24:28.234 align:middle line:84%
sort of explosive
catalytic energy

00:24:28.234 --> 00:24:30.036 align:middle line:84%
that is getting worked
out right there.

00:24:30.036 --> 00:24:31.504 align:middle line:84%
There's another example
I'll show you later

00:24:31.504 --> 00:24:33.739 align:middle line:84%
on in the slide show
as a result of this.

00:24:33.739 --> 00:24:35.274 align:middle line:90%
This is Tamer Lane.

00:24:35.274 --> 00:24:38.477 align:middle line:84%
He was one of the great
warriors and conquerors.

00:24:38.477 --> 00:24:43.182 align:middle line:84%
He was born on April 9, 1336,
which makes him an Aries.

00:24:43.182 --> 00:24:46.652 align:middle line:84%
He spoke about four or
five different languages.

00:24:46.652 --> 00:24:50.089 align:middle line:84%
He was part Mambal and part
Islam and wasn't afraid

00:24:50.089 --> 00:24:53.893 align:middle line:84%
to be either, depending upon
whichever situation suited him

00:24:53.893 --> 00:24:57.430 align:middle line:84%
the most, and the reason
I'm bringing him up here is

00:24:57.430 --> 00:25:00.233 align:middle line:84%
because of his connection
with Chechnya

00:25:00.233 --> 00:25:02.235 align:middle line:90%
and that part of the world.

00:25:02.235 --> 00:25:04.403 align:middle line:84%
Now here we have
another Tamerlane.

00:25:04.403 --> 00:25:08.441 align:middle line:84%
This is Tamerlane
Tsarnaev who is a Scorpio.

00:25:08.441 --> 00:25:12.411 align:middle line:84%
He of course is associated
with the Boston Marathon

00:25:12.411 --> 00:25:14.880 align:middle line:84%
and the bombings with
the Boston Marathon,

00:25:14.880 --> 00:25:16.816 align:middle line:84%
and the reason I'm
showing him is

00:25:16.816 --> 00:25:19.318 align:middle line:84%
because of the connection
not just with Tamerlane

00:25:19.318 --> 00:25:21.754 align:middle line:84%
and Tamerlane both
the same name,

00:25:21.754 --> 00:25:27.026 align:middle line:84%
but the Boston bombings took
place on April 15 in 2013,

00:25:27.026 --> 00:25:31.764 align:middle line:84%
just six days after the
birthday of the older Tamerlane

00:25:31.764 --> 00:25:37.136 align:middle line:84%
from 1336, the great
conqueror and warrior.

00:25:37.136 --> 00:25:39.038 align:middle line:90%
Here is Ruslan Tsarnae.

00:25:39.038 --> 00:25:40.873 align:middle line:84%
I just wanted to
bring this thing

00:25:40.873 --> 00:25:42.875 align:middle line:84%
because I thought it
was really interesting.

00:25:42.875 --> 00:25:48.347 align:middle line:84%
He is the uncle of Tsarnaev
of Tamerlane Tsarnaev.

00:25:48.347 --> 00:25:51.784 align:middle line:84%
Now, his last name is Tsarnaev
but he changed it to Tsarnae

00:25:51.784 --> 00:25:54.687 align:middle line:84%
because apparently he didn't
want to -- this is all prior,

00:25:54.687 --> 00:25:57.290 align:middle line:84%
by the way, to the
Boston bombings --

00:25:57.290 --> 00:26:00.092 align:middle line:84%
and he had a microphone in
front of him within hours

00:26:00.092 --> 00:26:02.862 align:middle line:90%
after the two brothers

00:26:02.862 --> 00:26:06.732 align:middle line:84%
or at least Tamerlane
Tsarnaev was killed and Jahar,

00:26:06.732 --> 00:26:10.269 align:middle line:84%
his brother, was
taken into custody.

00:26:10.269 --> 00:26:14.140 align:middle line:84%
What's interesting about him is
number one, he changed his name,

00:26:14.140 --> 00:26:18.311 align:middle line:84%
number two, he's
married to the daughter

00:26:18.311 --> 00:26:22.214 align:middle line:84%
of a very important CIA field
operative whose last name is

00:26:22.214 --> 00:26:25.017 align:middle line:84%
Fuller -- this is part
of the public record

00:26:25.017 --> 00:26:27.620 align:middle line:84%
by the way, I'm not
breaking anything new --

00:26:27.620 --> 00:26:29.121 align:middle line:90%
but he's married to the daughter

00:26:29.121 --> 00:26:32.391 align:middle line:84%
of a very important CIA
operative from Chechnya

00:26:32.391 --> 00:26:35.594 align:middle line:84%
who has very strong connections
to Dick Cheney and a whole bunch

00:26:35.594 --> 00:26:38.931 align:middle line:84%
of other really interesting
business associates.

00:26:38.931 --> 00:26:41.600 align:middle line:84%
He also lives in a
suburb of Maryland.

00:26:41.600 --> 00:26:45.404 align:middle line:84%
Mr. Tsarnaev certainly
appears to be an inside man.

00:26:45.404 --> 00:26:46.739 align:middle line:90%
Here we go, we're going to get

00:26:46.739 --> 00:26:49.141 align:middle line:84%
into the Sochi Olympics
a little bit here.

00:26:49.141 --> 00:26:50.810 align:middle line:84%
I thought this was
really interesting.

00:26:50.810 --> 00:26:54.046 align:middle line:84%
This was the original symbol
for the Sochi Olympics,

00:26:54.046 --> 00:26:57.717 align:middle line:84%
and the reason I brought this
up is because you can see kind

00:26:57.717 --> 00:27:00.920 align:middle line:84%
of the American influence
in this symbol.

00:27:00.920 --> 00:27:03.989 align:middle line:84%
We have the red, white and blue,
we have a number of stars here,

00:27:03.989 --> 00:27:06.092 align:middle line:90%
stars within stars within stars.

00:27:06.092 --> 00:27:09.395 align:middle line:84%
This is very emblematic in
some ways of the United States.

00:27:09.395 --> 00:27:12.732 align:middle line:84%
Now, this is the new symbol
for the Sochi Olympics.

00:27:12.732 --> 00:27:18.404 align:middle line:84%
It's very, very Russian, we have
2014, the five rings, .ru.

00:27:18.404 --> 00:27:21.207 align:middle line:90%
So perhaps somebody inside

00:27:21.207 --> 00:27:25.444 align:middle line:84%
of the new Politburo decided
they were getting a little too

00:27:25.444 --> 00:27:30.349 align:middle line:84%
close to the American
spirit there.

00:27:30.349 --> 00:27:36.655 align:middle line:84%
This is Nodar Kumaritashvili,
and he was a luge racer.

00:27:36.655 --> 00:27:40.159 align:middle line:84%
He's from Georgia, which
is not too far from Sochi,

00:27:40.159 --> 00:27:43.095 align:middle line:84%
and he died during
the Olympic trials

00:27:43.095 --> 00:27:46.665 align:middle line:84%
in the last winter
Olympics in Vancouver.

00:27:46.665 --> 00:27:49.435 align:middle line:84%
And there are people
inside the alternative sort

00:27:49.435 --> 00:27:55.741 align:middle line:84%
of research circles that believe
that this death was some form

00:27:55.741 --> 00:28:00.079 align:middle line:84%
of ritual sacrifice which
took place to christen

00:28:00.079 --> 00:28:02.381 align:middle line:90%
or start these Olympics.

00:28:02.381 --> 00:28:06.719 align:middle line:84%
What I found interesting
about this was that is has

00:28:06.719 --> 00:28:10.956 align:middle line:84%
in some ways for me, more to
do with this coming Olympics

00:28:10.956 --> 00:28:12.925 align:middle line:84%
than it has to do with
the Vancouver Olympics

00:28:12.925 --> 00:28:16.629 align:middle line:84%
to some extent, because of where
the next Olympics were going

00:28:16.629 --> 00:28:18.097 align:middle line:90%
to be held, which is Sochi,

00:28:18.097 --> 00:28:22.501 align:middle line:84%
not far from Georgia
where he's from.

00:28:22.501 --> 00:28:25.704 align:middle line:84%
Tragic, absolutely but I
just wanted to bring it

00:28:25.704 --> 00:28:28.841 align:middle line:84%
up because now we're
looking backwards here,

00:28:28.841 --> 00:28:33.746 align:middle line:84%
and we're moving forward in the
astrological arc to some extent.

00:28:33.746 --> 00:28:37.550 align:middle line:84%
Now, I just wanted to show
you sort of a little bit

00:28:37.550 --> 00:28:41.420 align:middle line:84%
of a side journey here,
but these are some images

00:28:41.420 --> 00:28:45.791 align:middle line:84%
that are associated with the
ritual aspect of the Olympics.

00:28:45.791 --> 00:28:49.028 align:middle line:84%
This is from Vancouver, and
here we have a violinist.

00:28:49.028 --> 00:28:52.331 align:middle line:84%
I think it might be Asha
Machisik, I'm not sure,

00:28:52.331 --> 00:28:55.935 align:middle line:84%
but here we have this
canoe that he's in

00:28:55.935 --> 00:28:58.404 align:middle line:90%
and he's performing something

00:28:58.404 --> 00:29:01.841 align:middle line:84%
from a story called
the Enchanted Canoe.

00:29:01.841 --> 00:29:06.111 align:middle line:84%
And the Enchanted Canoe
is kind of another telling

00:29:06.111 --> 00:29:08.848 align:middle line:90%
of a tale called the Wild Hunt.

00:29:08.848 --> 00:29:14.220 align:middle line:84%
And in the Wild Hunt, it's a
story about a group of huntsmen

00:29:14.220 --> 00:29:19.225 align:middle line:84%
who go into the countryside
at night and are overtaken

00:29:19.225 --> 00:29:23.395 align:middle line:84%
by the spirit of the
beast, of the wild beast,

00:29:23.395 --> 00:29:26.298 align:middle line:84%
and when they're overtaken
by the spirit of the beast,

00:29:26.298 --> 00:29:29.535 align:middle line:84%
they kill everything in sight
and they do all kinds of wild

00:29:29.535 --> 00:29:34.373 align:middle line:84%
and crazy stuff, and allow
this sort of very animal

00:29:34.373 --> 00:29:37.977 align:middle line:84%
and almost borderline
demonic spirit to come out.

00:29:37.977 --> 00:29:42.181 align:middle line:84%
So the Enchanted Canoe is kind
of a retelling of that tale,

00:29:42.181 --> 00:29:45.518 align:middle line:84%
and here we have a symbol of the
full moon and we have this kind

00:29:45.518 --> 00:29:48.687 align:middle line:84%
of beastly character that
is cast in silhouette.

00:29:48.687 --> 00:29:50.222 align:middle line:90%
Now, these are just symbols.

00:29:50.222 --> 00:29:51.290 align:middle line:90%
That's all they are.

00:29:51.290 --> 00:29:53.292 align:middle line:84%
They don't really
have any power over us;

00:29:53.292 --> 00:29:57.429 align:middle line:84%
however some people believe
that through the invocation

00:29:57.429 --> 00:30:01.200 align:middle line:84%
of these symbols, through
events like the Olympics,

00:30:01.200 --> 00:30:05.771 align:middle line:84%
that there is a binding of
a spell, of a collective

00:30:05.771 --> 00:30:10.676 align:middle line:84%
and planetary spell that we
participated and it connects us

00:30:10.676 --> 00:30:13.412 align:middle line:84%
to the illusion of separation
and duality on this planet.

00:30:13.412 --> 00:30:15.848 align:middle line:84%
Let me give you another
example here.

00:30:15.848 --> 00:30:19.318 align:middle line:84%
This is also from the
Vancouver Olympics.

00:30:19.318 --> 00:30:22.555 align:middle line:84%
Now, this is a summoning
of totemic energies

00:30:22.555 --> 00:30:25.324 align:middle line:84%
from Pacific Northwest,
Native American energies.

00:30:25.324 --> 00:30:27.426 align:middle line:84%
I think we have some
whales here.

00:30:27.426 --> 00:30:29.128 align:middle line:90%
These are killer whales.

00:30:29.128 --> 00:30:30.563 align:middle line:90%
But there are some people

00:30:30.563 --> 00:30:32.731 align:middle line:84%
that belie this is
actually a swastika.

00:30:32.731 --> 00:30:35.067 align:middle line:84%
Now, you can actually
see the swastika shape

00:30:35.067 --> 00:30:36.435 align:middle line:90%
if you look at it.

00:30:36.435 --> 00:30:39.939 align:middle line:84%
I just wanted to bring
this up as an example

00:30:39.939 --> 00:30:43.742 align:middle line:84%
of how images can be hidden
in plain sight at times.

00:30:43.742 --> 00:30:49.214 align:middle line:84%
At the very least, it is an
evocation of some kind of native

00:30:49.214 --> 00:30:51.951 align:middle line:84%
and shamanic energy, which
may not be all that bad.

00:30:51.951 --> 00:30:55.287 align:middle line:84%
These are old traditions that
are a part of this planet

00:30:55.287 --> 00:30:58.757 align:middle line:84%
and the history of this
planet, but they are using them

00:30:58.757 --> 00:31:00.559 align:middle line:84%
as a part of the
opening ceremonies

00:31:00.559 --> 00:31:02.761 align:middle line:90%
and the ritual of the Olympics.

00:31:02.761 --> 00:31:03.929 align:middle line:84%
And I wanted to show
you one more.

00:31:03.929 --> 00:31:05.898 align:middle line:90%
This is from the '11 Olympics.

00:31:05.898 --> 00:31:07.933 align:middle line:84%
This is the closing
ceremonies, I believe.

00:31:07.933 --> 00:31:12.371 align:middle line:84%
Here we have a phoenix up
above, we have a black sun

00:31:12.371 --> 00:31:18.377 align:middle line:84%
and the stadium here in London
is surrounded by pyramids.

00:31:18.377 --> 00:31:24.817 align:middle line:84%
So this is absolutely another
ritual that is being activated

00:31:24.817 --> 00:31:28.520 align:middle line:84%
through the intention and the
attention of not just everybody

00:31:28.520 --> 00:31:32.458 align:middle line:84%
in the stadium but
everybody watching this event.

00:31:32.458 --> 00:31:37.129 align:middle line:84%
So on some level this is
about entrainment and it's

00:31:37.129 --> 00:31:39.798 align:middle line:84%
about not necessarily the
empowerment of the people,

00:31:39.798 --> 00:31:43.435 align:middle line:84%
but the empowerment of the
energies that are associated

00:31:43.435 --> 00:31:46.639 align:middle line:84%
with this event, if you
willingly participate with them

00:31:46.639 --> 00:31:47.773 align:middle line:90%
through your attention.

00:31:47.773 --> 00:31:52.044 align:middle line:84%
So here is the next
stage of the metaritual

00:31:52.044 --> 00:31:53.712 align:middle line:90%
or the Olympic metaritual.

00:31:53.712 --> 00:31:56.482 align:middle line:84%
This is the Olympic
torch in space.

00:31:56.482 --> 00:31:58.584 align:middle line:84%
Now it's been in
space three times.

00:31:58.584 --> 00:32:02.421 align:middle line:84%
I think the first time it was
before the Atlanta Olympics,

00:32:02.421 --> 00:32:05.157 align:middle line:84%
the second time was for
the Melbourne Olympics,

00:32:05.157 --> 00:32:06.892 align:middle line:90%
and this is the third one.

00:32:06.892 --> 00:32:08.627 align:middle line:84%
Now, the torch is
not lit obviously

00:32:08.627 --> 00:32:10.329 align:middle line:90%
but it's being passed off.

00:32:10.329 --> 00:32:12.498 align:middle line:90%
This is a Russian cosmonaut,

00:32:12.498 --> 00:32:16.101 align:middle line:84%
and the torch ritual
here is symbolic

00:32:16.101 --> 00:32:22.541 align:middle line:84%
of the Promethean fire ritual or
the Promethean stealing of fire

00:32:22.541 --> 00:32:28.947 align:middle line:84%
from the gods which is a
Luciferic ritual in many ways.

00:32:28.947 --> 00:32:32.017 align:middle line:84%
So we have this light bringer,
or the source of light,

00:32:32.017 --> 00:32:35.387 align:middle line:84%
being stolen from God,
being stolen from the gods,

00:32:35.387 --> 00:32:38.090 align:middle line:84%
being brought down to
the planets, and of course,

00:32:38.090 --> 00:32:40.726 align:middle line:84%
it is going to light
the Olympic torch,

00:32:40.726 --> 00:32:44.229 align:middle line:84%
which is the zenith
of human achievement.

00:32:44.229 --> 00:32:48.333 align:middle line:84%
It is the light of man on
the world and on the planet.

00:32:48.333 --> 00:32:51.904 align:middle line:84%
So this is literally the
fire and the light falling

00:32:51.904 --> 00:32:54.206 align:middle line:84%
from the heavens, coming
down back to Earth,

00:32:54.206 --> 00:32:57.042 align:middle line:84%
and going to light
the Olympic torch.

00:32:57.042 --> 00:32:58.777 align:middle line:84%
Now, here's another
symbolic event.

00:32:58.777 --> 00:33:01.213 align:middle line:84%
This is again has to
do with Russia.

00:33:01.213 --> 00:33:04.349 align:middle line:84%
This is the fall of the
statue of Lenin in Ukraine.

00:33:04.349 --> 00:33:06.685 align:middle line:84%
It happened just
a few weeks ago.

00:33:06.685 --> 00:33:08.754 align:middle line:84%
Now, this is not the only
time Lenin has fallen.

00:33:08.754 --> 00:33:11.857 align:middle line:84%
There's been a few others around
the world during the course

00:33:11.857 --> 00:33:15.094 align:middle line:84%
of the 20th and 21st century,
but this is the most recent.

00:33:15.094 --> 00:33:16.295 align:middle line:90%
It is very symbolic.

00:33:16.295 --> 00:33:19.264 align:middle line:84%
The Ukrainians are trying
to divorce themselves

00:33:19.264 --> 00:33:21.867 align:middle line:84%
from their association
with Russia,

00:33:21.867 --> 00:33:24.403 align:middle line:84%
and of course this is
one way that you do it,

00:33:24.403 --> 00:33:28.307 align:middle line:84%
you topple the iconography
of the existing regime.

00:33:28.307 --> 00:33:30.476 align:middle line:90%
Will they be successful?

00:33:30.476 --> 00:33:34.947 align:middle line:84%
Only time will tell, but right
now it looks like the President

00:33:34.947 --> 00:33:38.584 align:middle line:84%
of Ukraine has struck a deal
with Putin and gotten a lot

00:33:38.584 --> 00:33:39.985 align:middle line:84%
of money from them
which has kept them

00:33:39.985 --> 00:33:41.520 align:middle line:90%
out of the European Union,

00:33:41.520 --> 00:33:44.690 align:middle line:84%
which would have made them
accountable to the World Bank.

00:33:44.690 --> 00:33:47.693 align:middle line:84%
So it's very difficult
for the Ukrainians,

00:33:47.693 --> 00:33:51.330 align:middle line:84%
they want their independence,
but it's certainly challenging

00:33:51.330 --> 00:33:54.166 align:middle line:84%
in terms of who they're going
to align themselves with.

00:33:54.166 --> 00:33:57.202 align:middle line:84%
At the present time it looks
like it's still Russia.

00:33:57.202 --> 00:33:58.570 align:middle line:84%
Now, what's also
really interesting

00:33:58.570 --> 00:34:02.407 align:middle line:84%
about this is once one statute
goes down, another comes up.

00:34:02.407 --> 00:34:03.742 align:middle line:90%
Here we have Mandela.

00:34:03.742 --> 00:34:08.446 align:middle line:84%
This is the Mandela statue,
which was recently unveiled,

00:34:08.446 --> 00:34:12.917 align:middle line:84%
and here he is, in
larger than life glory.

00:34:12.917 --> 00:34:14.185 align:middle line:90%
This is in South Africa.

00:34:14.185 --> 00:34:17.589 align:middle line:84%
We have the twin pillars
of wisdom on either side

00:34:17.589 --> 00:34:19.691 align:middle line:90%
of him, Yakin and Boaz,

00:34:19.691 --> 00:34:23.796 align:middle line:84%
and Mandela is striking
a very similar pose

00:34:23.796 --> 00:34:28.000 align:middle line:84%
to the Christ statue, which
you can see in Rio de Janeiro,

00:34:28.000 --> 00:34:33.672 align:middle line:84%
and he is assuming
an almost messianic

00:34:33.672 --> 00:34:36.742 align:middle line:90%
to some extent, posture there.

00:34:36.742 --> 00:34:41.146 align:middle line:84%
So we have the fall of one
icon and the rise of another,

00:34:41.146 --> 00:34:46.051 align:middle line:84%
and it really makes me feel
good that South Africa has just

00:34:46.051 --> 00:34:48.754 align:middle line:84%
as much chemtrails as the
United States and the rest

00:34:48.754 --> 00:34:51.790 align:middle line:84%
of the world, as we can see
them sort of floating by Mandela

00:34:51.790 --> 00:34:53.992 align:middle line:90%
in the distance there.

00:34:53.992 --> 00:34:54.927 align:middle line:90%
Oh, and here we go.

00:34:54.927 --> 00:34:56.161 align:middle line:90%
This is another image I wanted

00:34:56.161 --> 00:34:58.564 align:middle line:84%
to show you before we get
close to the end here.

00:34:58.564 --> 00:35:01.900 align:middle line:84%
This is this conflict
between Pisces and Aquarius,

00:35:01.900 --> 00:35:07.206 align:middle line:84%
which is personified by the
Orthodox imagery of Jesus

00:35:07.206 --> 00:35:10.876 align:middle line:84%
and a disciple, and
we have Pussy Riot,

00:35:10.876 --> 00:35:12.711 align:middle line:90%
actually two disciples of Jesus

00:35:12.711 --> 00:35:14.613 align:middle line:84%
and then we have
Pussy Riot here,

00:35:14.613 --> 00:35:21.820 align:middle line:84%
doing their Pussy Riot Aquarian
and ARCO sort of agitprop.

00:35:21.820 --> 00:35:23.822 align:middle line:84%
They're not very talented
but they're really good at

00:35:23.822 --> 00:35:28.126 align:middle line:84%
shit disturbing -- I guess this
is an adult audience, right?

00:35:28.126 --> 00:35:29.728 align:middle line:84%
So here they are,
they're doing their thing.

00:35:29.728 --> 00:35:32.164 align:middle line:84%
They eventually wind up
going to jail for this

00:35:32.164 --> 00:35:33.732 align:middle line:90%
and they've gotten released.

00:35:33.732 --> 00:35:36.501 align:middle line:84%
But the reason I'm
showing you is

00:35:36.501 --> 00:35:41.773 align:middle line:84%
because here we have this really
intense, dynamic confluence

00:35:41.773 --> 00:35:46.345 align:middle line:84%
between that old school,
old world Piscean energy

00:35:46.345 --> 00:35:50.249 align:middle line:84%
through the Orthodox Church and
even to some extent with Putin,

00:35:50.249 --> 00:35:55.654 align:middle line:84%
and this kind of Aquarian
Uranian radical energy

00:35:55.654 --> 00:35:57.756 align:middle line:84%
that in some ways
is still a holdover

00:35:57.756 --> 00:35:59.758 align:middle line:90%
from the Bolshevik Revolution.

00:35:59.758 --> 00:36:02.060 align:middle line:84%
Russia still has
to deal with this.

00:36:02.060 --> 00:36:06.064 align:middle line:84%
It's part of their
astrological karma.

00:36:06.064 --> 00:36:06.765 align:middle line:90%
So here we go.

00:36:06.765 --> 00:36:08.267 align:middle line:90%
Here's the last slide.

00:36:08.267 --> 00:36:12.905 align:middle line:84%
This is the configuration
for April 23 of this year,

00:36:12.905 --> 00:36:14.773 align:middle line:84%
and I just wanted to show
this to you because --

00:36:14.773 --> 00:36:19.278 align:middle line:84%
and I showed this to you before
with the preview for 2014 --

00:36:19.278 --> 00:36:20.946 align:middle line:84%
but when I was looking
at Russia's chart,

00:36:20.946 --> 00:36:25.884 align:middle line:84%
I noticed that Pluto will
be at 13 degrees Capricorn,

00:36:25.884 --> 00:36:30.322 align:middle line:84%
which puts it right
on Uranus' --

00:36:30.322 --> 00:36:34.726 align:middle line:84%
Russia's natal Uranus in
Capricorn at the same degree.

00:36:34.726 --> 00:36:40.732 align:middle line:84%
So Russia is going to have
a significant role to play

00:36:40.732 --> 00:36:45.504 align:middle line:84%
in this cardinal cross,
this cardinal square,

00:36:45.504 --> 00:36:48.907 align:middle line:84%
these very intense,
very tight energies

00:36:48.907 --> 00:36:54.479 align:middle line:84%
at 13 Mars Libra retrograde, at
13 Pluto retrograde, Capricorn,

00:36:54.479 --> 00:36:59.418 align:middle line:84%
over here at 13 Uranus
in Aries, and down here

00:36:59.418 --> 00:37:01.553 align:middle line:90%
at 13 Jupiter in Cancer.

00:37:01.553 --> 00:37:05.924 align:middle line:84%
So we have this really dynamic,
intense catalytic energy

00:37:05.924 --> 00:37:10.729 align:middle line:84%
and it's impacting Russia
directly, with first its Uranus

00:37:10.729 --> 00:37:17.636 align:middle line:84%
and then in 2015 transiting
Pluto will hit Russia's natal

00:37:17.636 --> 00:37:22.574 align:middle line:84%
Neptune, also in Capricorn, so
that'll be another iteration

00:37:22.574 --> 00:37:26.979 align:middle line:84%
and another phase and cycle of
this transformation of Russia,

00:37:26.979 --> 00:37:30.048 align:middle line:84%
which by the way, really
took place when Pluto went

00:37:30.048 --> 00:37:33.151 align:middle line:90%
into Capricorn in 2009.

00:37:33.151 --> 00:37:37.122 align:middle line:84%
So we've seen really in
some ways the social rise

00:37:37.122 --> 00:37:39.257 align:middle line:90%
of Russia as a result of this.

00:37:39.257 --> 00:37:40.659 align:middle line:90%
What does this mean?

00:37:40.659 --> 00:37:44.429 align:middle line:84%
Well, I think that this is part
of what happened in Volgograd.

00:37:44.429 --> 00:37:47.566 align:middle line:84%
I think Russia is going to
have more internal conflict,

00:37:47.566 --> 00:37:51.336 align:middle line:84%
more internal strife, but also
because it's the Ninth House,

00:37:51.336 --> 00:37:54.973 align:middle line:84%
the United States of America
also has a role to play in this.

00:37:54.973 --> 00:37:59.177 align:middle line:84%
Why? Because down there in Third
House, right here almost --

00:37:59.177 --> 00:38:02.147 align:middle line:84%
well, it's really on
the cusp of the IC.

00:38:02.147 --> 00:38:04.016 align:middle line:90%
That's Jupiter in Cancer,

00:38:04.016 --> 00:38:05.350 align:middle line:84%
Cancer again being
representative

00:38:05.350 --> 00:38:06.718 align:middle line:90%
of the United States.

00:38:06.718 --> 00:38:13.425 align:middle line:84%
So some time right around the
23rd of April, I expect things

00:38:13.425 --> 00:38:16.561 align:middle line:84%
to heat up between these
two countries, and in terms

00:38:16.561 --> 00:38:20.999 align:middle line:84%
of the United States, it will
happen probably just a little

00:38:20.999 --> 00:38:23.735 align:middle line:84%
bit before the mid term, so it
will take place here as well,

00:38:23.735 --> 00:38:26.738 align:middle line:84%
and that that's a whole
other topic of conversation,

00:38:26.738 --> 00:38:30.475 align:middle line:84%
the mid terms of 2014, and maybe
sometime we'll look at that

00:38:30.475 --> 00:38:32.077 align:middle line:90%
as well in the Eleventh House.

00:38:32.077 --> 00:38:33.345 align:middle line:90%
So there we go.

00:38:33.345 --> 00:38:38.684 align:middle line:84%
There's a kind of a very
quick and kind of intense look

00:38:38.684 --> 00:38:42.120 align:middle line:84%
at the astrology of
Russia for 2014 and Pluti--

00:38:42.120 --> 00:38:47.192 align:middle line:84%
Pluto and Putin together, we can
call them Plutin--

00:38:47.192 --> 00:38:50.829 align:middle line:84%
and hopefully you had a sense
as to the catalytic energies

00:38:50.829 --> 00:38:52.831 align:middle line:84%
that are taking place
there right now.

00:38:52.831 --> 00:38:54.800 align:middle line:84%
It's a country to
keep your eye on,

00:38:54.800 --> 00:38:59.204 align:middle line:84%
not just from its own
geographic perspective,

00:38:59.204 --> 00:39:01.339 align:middle line:84%
but also from people
within this country as well,

00:39:01.339 --> 00:39:03.909 align:middle line:84%
and how they view
Russia and Putin,

00:39:03.909 --> 00:39:06.912 align:middle line:84%
both on the right
and on the left.

00:39:06.912 --> 00:39:08.013 align:middle line:90%
So that's it.

00:39:08.013 --> 00:39:09.915 align:middle line:84%
Until next time, take
care of yourselves.

00:39:09.915 --> 00:39:12.617 align:middle line:84%
I'm Robert Phoenix, and
thank you for joining me

00:39:12.617 --> 00:39:13.618 align:middle line:90%
in the Eleventh House.
