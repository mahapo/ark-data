00:00:16.542 --> 00:00:18.250 align:middle line:84%
>> ROBERT PHOENIX:
Hey, what's happening?

00:00:18.250 --> 00:00:20.120 align:middle line:84%
Robert Phoenix here,
and welcome back

00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:22.280 align:middle line:84%
to The Eleventh House,
another episode.

00:00:22.280 --> 00:00:24.250 align:middle line:84%
And today, we're going
to be doing something

00:00:24.250 --> 00:00:26.950 align:middle line:84%
just a little bit different
than what we normally do.

00:00:26.950 --> 00:00:29.250 align:middle line:84%
We're gonna just
put the meta aside

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:32.740 align:middle line:84%
for a moment, or at least
the next three episodes.

00:00:32.740 --> 00:00:34.670 align:middle line:84%
And we're to get
into some astrology,

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:36.900 align:middle line:90%
some instructional astrology.

00:00:36.900 --> 00:00:38.712 align:middle line:84%
And first of all, I
want to say thank you

00:00:38.712 --> 00:00:40.170 align:middle line:84%
to the people that
have reached out

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:44.380 align:middle line:84%
and have either sent me emails
or are following me on Twitter

00:00:44.380 --> 00:00:46.220 align:middle line:84%
or have even set up
personal readings.

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:48.160 align:middle line:84%
And some of the feedback
that I've received

00:00:48.160 --> 00:00:50.330 align:middle line:84%
was that there are
people that would

00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:52.670 align:middle line:84%
like to learn a little
bit more about astrology,

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:54.940 align:middle line:84%
or maybe even a
little more about how

00:00:54.940 --> 00:00:57.960 align:middle line:84%
I look at astrology
and practice astrology.

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:01.070 align:middle line:84%
And one of the things that I can
share with you about astrology

00:01:01.070 --> 00:01:03.600 align:middle line:84%
is that it's a
really broad subject.

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:05.780 align:middle line:90%
And it's like an art form.

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:08.560 align:middle line:84%
And some people play
astrology like it's jazz

00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:10.350 align:middle line:84%
or they practice
astrology like it's jazz.

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:13.630 align:middle line:84%
Or some people are very
into Hellenistic astrology.

00:01:13.630 --> 00:01:16.150 align:middle line:84%
So it's a very
classical art form.

00:01:16.150 --> 00:01:18.820 align:middle line:84%
Other people use astrology
to understand people

00:01:18.820 --> 00:01:20.190 align:middle line:90%
and to understand relationships.

00:01:20.190 --> 00:01:22.399 align:middle line:84%
And you get into
things like synastry.

00:01:22.399 --> 00:01:23.815 align:middle line:84%
So there's a lot
of different uses

00:01:23.815 --> 00:01:26.090 align:middle line:84%
and a lot of modalities
for astrology

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:30.790 align:middle line:84%
for people to plug into and
find their own personal use

00:01:30.790 --> 00:01:32.960 align:middle line:84%
and technique for how
they can interact with it.

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:36.270 align:middle line:84%
It's an absolutely fascinating
art form and science.

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:38.460 align:middle line:84%
And today, we're
going to get into it

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:40.460 align:middle line:90%
at a pretty primary level.

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:43.050 align:middle line:84%
And I'm going to break
down the 12 signs.

00:01:43.050 --> 00:01:44.610 align:middle line:84%
And for some of
you out there who

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:46.710 align:middle line:84%
have a lot of experience
with astrology,

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:49.316 align:middle line:84%
you may learn a few
things along the way.

00:01:49.316 --> 00:01:51.390 align:middle line:84%
And if you don't,
have some patience,

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:54.630 align:middle line:84%
because some of the other
folks out there are still

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:56.750 align:middle line:84%
trying to put this all
together and understand it

00:01:56.750 --> 00:01:59.020 align:middle line:84%
and make it a meaningful
experience for themselves.

00:01:59.020 --> 00:02:02.460 align:middle line:84%
So what I've done today is
I've broken down all 12 signs.

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:05.880 align:middle line:84%
And we're going to be looking at
the basic fundamental structure

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:08.660 align:middle line:84%
of each sign and the
strengths and weaknesses,

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:12.910 align:middle line:84%
some cultural ciphers,
and how I see each sign

00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:14.560 align:middle line:84%
and how it relates
to the individual.

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:18.740 align:middle line:84%
And just to let you know,
my overall personal point

00:02:18.740 --> 00:02:21.680 align:middle line:84%
of view for astrology or
my philosophy for astrology

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:24.400 align:middle line:84%
is that it's an art
form and a science that

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:26.430 align:middle line:84%
helps us accomplish a
lot of things in life.

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:29.270 align:middle line:84%
But ultimately, what
I think it can do

00:02:29.270 --> 00:02:32.180 align:middle line:84%
is I think it can be used
as a tool for healing

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:36.610 align:middle line:84%
and as a tool to bring a person
closer to their own soul,

00:02:36.610 --> 00:02:38.480 align:middle line:84%
to their own
personal will, where

00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:42.200 align:middle line:84%
the personality and the will
can mesh together and blend.

00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:45.180 align:middle line:84%
And we can use the chart, and
we can use aspects in the chart,

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:48.400 align:middle line:84%
and we can use transits to
refine that journey on a day

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:49.600 align:middle line:90%
to day basis.

00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:52.465 align:middle line:84%
So let's get into this and
jump into The Eleventh House

00:02:52.465 --> 00:02:54.700 align:middle line:84%
and start breaking down
some of these signs.

00:02:54.700 --> 00:02:56.090 align:middle line:90%
Of course, we start with Aries.

00:02:56.090 --> 00:02:57.490 align:middle line:90%
It's the first sign.

00:02:57.490 --> 00:03:00.300 align:middle line:84%
We start off with
the spring equinox.

00:03:00.300 --> 00:03:06.270 align:middle line:84%
And Aries goes roughly
from March 23 to April 22.

00:03:06.270 --> 00:03:09.790 align:middle line:84%
Of course, the element
of Aries is fire.

00:03:09.790 --> 00:03:12.060 align:middle line:90%
And the energy is mutable.

00:03:12.060 --> 00:03:14.050 align:middle line:84%
And we'll get into
what that means

00:03:14.050 --> 00:03:17.240 align:middle line:90%
as we go on throughout the show.

00:03:17.240 --> 00:03:19.660 align:middle line:84%
There are mutable signs
and there are fixed signs

00:03:19.660 --> 00:03:21.300 align:middle line:90%
and there are cardinal signs.

00:03:21.300 --> 00:03:25.290 align:middle line:84%
And they make up the entirety
of the zodiac-- Aries,

00:03:25.290 --> 00:03:28.800 align:middle line:84%
Cancer, Libra, and Capricorn
are the cardinal signs.

00:03:28.800 --> 00:03:31.630 align:middle line:84%
And currently, we're in a
cardinal cross right now.

00:03:31.630 --> 00:03:34.515 align:middle line:84%
There's a lot of heavy duty
cardinal activity with Mars

00:03:34.515 --> 00:03:37.480 align:middle line:84%
in Libra, Pluto in
Capricorn, Uranus in Aries,

00:03:37.480 --> 00:03:39.070 align:middle line:90%
and Jupiter in Cancer.

00:03:39.070 --> 00:03:41.650 align:middle line:84%
So we're getting a lot of
intense cardinal energy.

00:03:41.650 --> 00:03:44.135 align:middle line:84%
So if you're an Aries or you're
a Libra or you're a Cancer

00:03:44.135 --> 00:03:46.660 align:middle line:84%
or you're a Capricorn
or your ascendant is

00:03:46.660 --> 00:03:49.510 align:middle line:84%
any of those signs, this is
really a hot time for you

00:03:49.510 --> 00:03:50.270 align:middle line:90%
right now.

00:03:50.270 --> 00:03:53.770 align:middle line:84%
There's a lot of dynamic energy,
a lot of challenging energy.

00:03:53.770 --> 00:03:56.750 align:middle line:84%
When we have these squares,
we have great potential

00:03:56.750 --> 00:04:00.510 align:middle line:84%
for change and to be
catalytically converted

00:04:00.510 --> 00:04:02.330 align:middle line:90%
in our own personal lives.

00:04:02.330 --> 00:04:05.650 align:middle line:84%
So the key words, the
strengths of Aries,

00:04:05.650 --> 00:04:11.570 align:middle line:84%
are independent, directed,
generous, optimistic,

00:04:11.570 --> 00:04:13.180 align:middle line:90%
and enthusiastic.

00:04:13.180 --> 00:04:20.110 align:middle line:84%
Aries is really known for
being absolutely and utterly

00:04:20.110 --> 00:04:24.370 align:middle line:84%
courageous, and not just
courageous, but really

00:04:24.370 --> 00:04:28.040 align:middle line:84%
self-directed in a way
that perhaps other signs

00:04:28.040 --> 00:04:30.290 align:middle line:84%
and other people don't
quite understand.

00:04:30.290 --> 00:04:32.760 align:middle line:84%
If you have a
person in your life

00:04:32.760 --> 00:04:35.540 align:middle line:84%
who just completely
pushes forward,

00:04:35.540 --> 00:04:38.980 align:middle line:84%
no matter what the circumstances
or no matter what the odds,

00:04:38.980 --> 00:04:40.810 align:middle line:84%
there's probably a
pretty good chance

00:04:40.810 --> 00:04:42.810 align:middle line:90%
that that person is an Aries.

00:04:42.810 --> 00:04:46.300 align:middle line:84%
Aries also rules
the head and most

00:04:46.300 --> 00:04:48.850 align:middle line:84%
of the organs in the head--
eyes, nose, mouth, ears, et

00:04:48.850 --> 00:04:50.000 align:middle line:90%
cetera.

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:53.110 align:middle line:84%
And what's really fascinating
is that right now, Uranus

00:04:53.110 --> 00:04:54.270 align:middle line:90%
is in Aries.

00:04:54.270 --> 00:04:58.190 align:middle line:84%
And one of the big things that
is coming down with Uranus

00:04:58.190 --> 00:05:01.680 align:middle line:84%
in Aries is
concussions in the NFL.

00:05:01.680 --> 00:05:04.920 align:middle line:84%
And of course, Aries
rules war and warriors.

00:05:04.920 --> 00:05:07.864 align:middle line:84%
And football is an aspect
of war and warriors.

00:05:07.864 --> 00:05:09.030 align:middle line:90%
And what are we seeing here?

00:05:09.030 --> 00:05:12.300 align:middle line:84%
We're seeing this kind
of radical understanding

00:05:12.300 --> 00:05:16.470 align:middle line:84%
about how head trauma is
affecting football players

00:05:16.470 --> 00:05:17.950 align:middle line:90%
on a day to day basis.

00:05:17.950 --> 00:05:21.540 align:middle line:84%
And in fact, recent
statistics have just

00:05:21.540 --> 00:05:26.320 align:middle line:84%
come out that there's been
a 27% drop in youth football

00:05:26.320 --> 00:05:28.830 align:middle line:84%
ever since there's been
information coming out

00:05:28.830 --> 00:05:30.960 align:middle line:90%
about CTE and concussions.

00:05:30.960 --> 00:05:33.060 align:middle line:84%
So Uranus in Aries--
definitely making

00:05:33.060 --> 00:05:35.177 align:middle line:84%
an impact on the
National Football League

00:05:35.177 --> 00:05:36.260 align:middle line:90%
and the sport of football.

00:05:36.260 --> 00:05:37.885 align:middle line:84%
And not just football--
it's coming out

00:05:37.885 --> 00:05:40.000 align:middle line:84%
in baseball and
other sports as well.

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:43.040 align:middle line:84%
The key words, the
weaknesses, for Aries

00:05:43.040 --> 00:05:49.110 align:middle line:84%
are moody, short tempered, self
involved, impulsive, impatient,

00:05:49.110 --> 00:05:50.520 align:middle line:90%
high strung.

00:05:50.520 --> 00:05:54.230 align:middle line:84%
Aries have such a
command over themselves

00:05:54.230 --> 00:05:57.320 align:middle line:84%
and their own
environment that rarely--

00:05:57.320 --> 00:05:59.280 align:middle line:84%
and again, if you know
an Aries in your life,

00:05:59.280 --> 00:06:01.870 align:middle line:84%
you might be able to
check this-- rarely

00:06:01.870 --> 00:06:04.360 align:middle line:84%
do they ever apologize
for something.

00:06:04.360 --> 00:06:06.400 align:middle line:84%
And if they do, they may
have some other planets

00:06:06.400 --> 00:06:09.165 align:middle line:84%
in their chart, perhaps
a little bit of Pisces,

00:06:09.165 --> 00:06:13.120 align:middle line:84%
or maybe some
Taurus, because those

00:06:13.120 --> 00:06:16.000 align:middle line:84%
are the signs that
precede or follow Aries.

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:18.780 align:middle line:84%
But they're so self-directed
that very rarely

00:06:18.780 --> 00:06:20.530 align:middle line:90%
do they offer up an apology.

00:06:20.530 --> 00:06:22.980 align:middle line:84%
And it's not because
they're necessarily

00:06:22.980 --> 00:06:27.120 align:middle line:84%
rude or unapologetic
or they're neglecting

00:06:27.120 --> 00:06:30.310 align:middle line:84%
to apologize because they
want to piss somebody off.

00:06:30.310 --> 00:06:33.020 align:middle line:84%
Really, they're just
so engaged in getting

00:06:33.020 --> 00:06:35.900 align:middle line:84%
to the next moment or
the next experience

00:06:35.900 --> 00:06:41.170 align:middle line:84%
that an apology sometimes is
an extraneous act for them

00:06:41.170 --> 00:06:42.160 align:middle line:90%
to be engaged in.

00:06:42.160 --> 00:06:45.470 align:middle line:84%
Now, conversely,
on the other end,

00:06:45.470 --> 00:06:46.925 align:middle line:84%
Libras are very
good apologizing.

00:06:46.925 --> 00:06:50.590 align:middle line:84%
Perhaps sometimes they're too
quick to apologize and use

00:06:50.590 --> 00:06:52.810 align:middle line:84%
an apology as a
form of diplomacy

00:06:52.810 --> 00:06:54.914 align:middle line:84%
in getting out of any
particular situation

00:06:54.914 --> 00:06:56.830 align:middle line:84%
that might be a little
uncomfortable for them.

00:06:56.830 --> 00:06:58.710 align:middle line:84%
So that's the flip
side of Aries.

00:06:58.710 --> 00:07:03.680 align:middle line:84%
Some of the cultural ciphers
for Aries are, of course, war,

00:07:03.680 --> 00:07:06.690 align:middle line:84%
football-- we've just
talked about that-- MMA,

00:07:06.690 --> 00:07:09.380 align:middle line:84%
mixed martial arts,
very popular now.

00:07:09.380 --> 00:07:10.710 align:middle line:90%
It's displaced boxing.

00:07:10.710 --> 00:07:14.430 align:middle line:84%
It's become the new sport
of the Roman gladiators.

00:07:14.430 --> 00:07:16.340 align:middle line:84%
And what's
fascinating about MMA,

00:07:16.340 --> 00:07:20.340 align:middle line:84%
unlike boxing, is that it's
embraced both men and women,

00:07:20.340 --> 00:07:23.760 align:middle line:84%
just like the Army has embraced
both men and women, as well.

00:07:23.760 --> 00:07:27.240 align:middle line:84%
So we have male and female
warriors in a lot of ways.

00:07:27.240 --> 00:07:29.670 align:middle line:84%
That is very typically
Aries, as well.

00:07:29.670 --> 00:07:31.840 align:middle line:84%
There is no
differentiation with Aries.

00:07:31.840 --> 00:07:34.860 align:middle line:84%
It's all pretty much one,
even though the energy itself

00:07:34.860 --> 00:07:38.610 align:middle line:84%
is very male, very
yang, or very cardinal.

00:07:38.610 --> 00:07:42.280 align:middle line:84%
Formula One Racing-- that's
another very Aries sport.

00:07:42.280 --> 00:07:46.440 align:middle line:84%
And in fact, one of the most
successful Formula One drivers

00:07:46.440 --> 00:07:49.294 align:middle line:84%
of all time was Ayrton
Senna, who was an Aries.

00:07:49.294 --> 00:07:50.710 align:middle line:84%
And of course,
what did he die of?

00:07:50.710 --> 00:07:52.857 align:middle line:90%
He died of a head injury.

00:07:52.857 --> 00:07:53.940 align:middle line:90%
What else do we have here?

00:07:53.940 --> 00:07:55.360 align:middle line:90%
We've got the Saint Louis rams.

00:07:55.360 --> 00:07:57.750 align:middle line:84%
That's a cultural
cipher in football.

00:07:57.750 --> 00:08:01.020 align:middle line:84%
They actually where the
ram's horns on their head.

00:08:01.020 --> 00:08:03.990 align:middle line:84%
They went from Los Angeles
to Saint Louis, now.

00:08:03.990 --> 00:08:08.360 align:middle line:84%
Handguns-- that's another
cultural cipher for Aries.

00:08:08.360 --> 00:08:11.560 align:middle line:84%
Skinheads-- now, again,
Aries rules the head.

00:08:11.560 --> 00:08:18.580 align:middle line:84%
And unlike Leo, which are known
for their very long manes, very

00:08:18.580 --> 00:08:21.830 align:middle line:84%
exotic hairdos at
times, Aries are

00:08:21.830 --> 00:08:23.790 align:middle line:84%
known for not having
any hair at all.

00:08:23.790 --> 00:08:26.340 align:middle line:84%
And in fact, people
that have Aries rising

00:08:26.340 --> 00:08:30.210 align:middle line:84%
or have a heavy Aries
component in the first house

00:08:30.210 --> 00:08:32.440 align:middle line:84%
generally, for the
males, generally

00:08:32.440 --> 00:08:35.350 align:middle line:84%
tend to lose their
hair earlier in life.

00:08:35.350 --> 00:08:38.950 align:middle line:84%
So skinheads would be
a cosmetic association

00:08:38.950 --> 00:08:41.280 align:middle line:84%
that we would link with
Aries, but would also

00:08:41.280 --> 00:08:43.970 align:middle line:84%
have a connection with
things like the Aryan

00:08:43.970 --> 00:08:45.820 align:middle line:84%
Brotherhood or the
Aryan movement.

00:08:45.820 --> 00:08:49.830 align:middle line:84%
And again, we get into war and
we get into anger, aggression,

00:08:49.830 --> 00:08:52.140 align:middle line:90%
violence as a lifestyle.

00:08:52.140 --> 00:08:57.150 align:middle line:84%
ICBMs, missiles-- very
Aries-- the planet Mars,

00:08:57.150 --> 00:09:00.490 align:middle line:84%
the Kona Iron Man-- any
kind of Iron Man event,

00:09:00.490 --> 00:09:03.230 align:middle line:84%
the triathlon
event-- very Aries.

00:09:03.230 --> 00:09:06.270 align:middle line:84%
Obelisks-- if you
travel around the world,

00:09:06.270 --> 00:09:09.490 align:middle line:84%
you'll be able to see obelisks,
which are in every country.

00:09:09.490 --> 00:09:12.500 align:middle line:84%
In this country, of course,
the most famous obelisk

00:09:12.500 --> 00:09:14.790 align:middle line:90%
is the Washington Monument.

00:09:14.790 --> 00:09:18.330 align:middle line:84%
The obelisk is a really
interesting piece

00:09:18.330 --> 00:09:21.420 align:middle line:84%
of architecture and
sculpture in that

00:09:21.420 --> 00:09:25.700 align:middle line:84%
it represents this male
phallic principle, number one.

00:09:25.700 --> 00:09:28.500 align:middle line:84%
But it also draws
in telluric energy

00:09:28.500 --> 00:09:34.110 align:middle line:84%
from the atmosphere and
some of the etheric planes.

00:09:34.110 --> 00:09:37.880 align:middle line:84%
So the obelisk, associated
with sacred geometry

00:09:37.880 --> 00:09:41.150 align:middle line:84%
and architecture, is
a very Aries symbol

00:09:41.150 --> 00:09:42.630 align:middle line:90%
and cultural cipher.

00:09:42.630 --> 00:09:44.910 align:middle line:84%
Concussions-- we
talked about them

00:09:44.910 --> 00:09:47.400 align:middle line:84%
and how they're making
an impact on the NFL.

00:09:47.400 --> 00:09:52.802 align:middle line:84%
Pit bulls-- these are also
very Aries kinds of totems,

00:09:52.802 --> 00:09:54.260 align:middle line:84%
because the pit
bull, of course, is

00:09:54.260 --> 00:09:57.320 align:middle line:84%
known for fighting and
being the dog of choice

00:09:57.320 --> 00:10:01.820 align:middle line:84%
for pit bull dog fighting and
dog wagering, unfortunately.

00:10:01.820 --> 00:10:03.720 align:middle line:84%
But they are also
a symbol of Aries.

00:10:03.720 --> 00:10:06.750 align:middle line:84%
They're known for
their large heads, jaws

00:10:06.750 --> 00:10:10.750 align:middle line:84%
that lock down and won't let go
of their prey or the other dog.

00:10:10.750 --> 00:10:13.650 align:middle line:84%
So pit bulls are very
prominent in our culture.

00:10:13.650 --> 00:10:15.170 align:middle line:84%
And cayenne pepper--
had to throw

00:10:15.170 --> 00:10:16.990 align:middle line:90%
a little pepper, a little heat.

00:10:16.990 --> 00:10:19.540 align:middle line:84%
That's also very
symbolic of Aries.

00:10:19.540 --> 00:10:21.830 align:middle line:84%
Again, if you hang out with
somebody who's an Aries,

00:10:21.830 --> 00:10:24.970 align:middle line:84%
there's a very good chance that
they like spicy food, as well.

00:10:24.970 --> 00:10:28.730 align:middle line:84%
Now, in astrology,
perhaps there's

00:10:28.730 --> 00:10:32.100 align:middle line:84%
no such as a higher or
lower or better or worse--

00:10:32.100 --> 00:10:38.210 align:middle line:84%
that it's all one kind
of miasmic zeitgeist

00:10:38.210 --> 00:10:39.290 align:middle line:90%
for astrology.

00:10:39.290 --> 00:10:42.730 align:middle line:84%
But I'd like to think that
there are vibrations that we

00:10:42.730 --> 00:10:47.650 align:middle line:84%
can check into and figure out
how we can merge with the quote

00:10:47.650 --> 00:10:51.000 align:middle line:84%
unquote higher purpose of
astrology as an art form.

00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:54.980 align:middle line:84%
So I put a higher octave
down for each sign.

00:10:54.980 --> 00:10:58.350 align:middle line:84%
And for Aries, it's
"There is only one will."

00:10:58.350 --> 00:11:02.100 align:middle line:84%
And what I mean by that is
that the individual will

00:11:02.100 --> 00:11:05.460 align:middle line:84%
and the will of the soul or the
will of God, they're all one.

00:11:05.460 --> 00:11:08.820 align:middle line:84%
And when an Aries is really
on and when an Aries is really

00:11:08.820 --> 00:11:12.920 align:middle line:84%
refined and in the moment
and living their chart

00:11:12.920 --> 00:11:15.074 align:middle line:84%
and living their
own personal design,

00:11:15.074 --> 00:11:16.490 align:middle line:84%
that's exactly
what they're doing.

00:11:16.490 --> 00:11:19.370 align:middle line:84%
They're making instinctive
choices on a moment

00:11:19.370 --> 00:11:21.840 align:middle line:84%
to moment basis, on a
day to day basis, which

00:11:21.840 --> 00:11:23.960 align:middle line:84%
aligns their spirit
and their will

00:11:23.960 --> 00:11:27.770 align:middle line:90%
as one actor and one action.

00:11:27.770 --> 00:11:28.710 align:middle line:90%
So that's Aries.

00:11:28.710 --> 00:11:31.640 align:middle line:84%
That's just a snapshot
and a bit of a nutshell.

00:11:31.640 --> 00:11:34.470 align:middle line:84%
But it gives you
an understanding,

00:11:34.470 --> 00:11:36.970 align:middle line:84%
an example of the energy of the
sign and some of the symbols

00:11:36.970 --> 00:11:38.590 align:middle line:90%
that are associated with it.

00:11:38.590 --> 00:11:40.910 align:middle line:84%
So let's move onto
the next sign, which

00:11:40.910 --> 00:11:44.650 align:middle line:90%
is Taurus-- April 22, May 21.

00:11:44.650 --> 00:11:48.532 align:middle line:84%
Tauruses are known for their
very deep speaking voices.

00:11:48.532 --> 00:11:49.990 align:middle line:84%
I think Barry White
might have been

00:11:49.990 --> 00:11:51.290 align:middle line:90%
a Taurus, if I'm not mistaken.

00:11:51.290 --> 00:11:52.860 align:middle line:90%
I know Stevie Wonder is.

00:11:52.860 --> 00:11:55.310 align:middle line:84%
I know Aretha Franklin
is and Cher is.

00:11:55.310 --> 00:12:00.420 align:middle line:84%
So we see Taurus associated
with the voice and the throat

00:12:00.420 --> 00:12:01.330 align:middle line:90%
region.

00:12:01.330 --> 00:12:07.510 align:middle line:84%
So Taurus represents
singing, oration, chanting.

00:12:07.510 --> 00:12:10.920 align:middle line:84%
People that are Taurus, if you
ever get stuck in your life,

00:12:10.920 --> 00:12:11.960 align:middle line:90%
don't be afraid to sing.

00:12:11.960 --> 00:12:13.530 align:middle line:90%
Don't be afraid to chant.

00:12:13.530 --> 00:12:15.050 align:middle line:90%
Don't be afraid to tone.

00:12:15.050 --> 00:12:16.240 align:middle line:90%
Unlock your throat.

00:12:16.240 --> 00:12:17.600 align:middle line:90%
Unlock your voice.

00:12:17.600 --> 00:12:20.340 align:middle line:90%
The element for Taurus is earth.

00:12:20.340 --> 00:12:21.930 align:middle line:90%
And the energy is fixed.

00:12:21.930 --> 00:12:23.620 align:middle line:90%
Yes, Taurus is a bull.

00:12:23.620 --> 00:12:26.120 align:middle line:84%
Fixed energy does mean
that the individual

00:12:26.120 --> 00:12:28.690 align:middle line:90%
has a stubborn streak to them.

00:12:28.690 --> 00:12:31.600 align:middle line:84%
People that are Taurus
or Scorpio or Leo

00:12:31.600 --> 00:12:34.110 align:middle line:84%
or Aquarius-- they're all
part of the fixed family.

00:12:34.110 --> 00:12:37.470 align:middle line:84%
And they all have their
relationship with fixed energy.

00:12:37.470 --> 00:12:40.160 align:middle line:84%
The fixed manifestation
for Taurus

00:12:40.160 --> 00:12:43.230 align:middle line:84%
is that Taurus people don't
necessarily like to move.

00:12:43.230 --> 00:12:46.360 align:middle line:84%
Once they have their
domain or their abode

00:12:46.360 --> 00:12:49.000 align:middle line:84%
and they really
trick it out and it's

00:12:49.000 --> 00:12:52.830 align:middle line:84%
really comfortable and nice and
cozy, they don't like to move.

00:12:52.830 --> 00:12:54.690 align:middle line:84%
My grandmother,
she was a Taurus.

00:12:54.690 --> 00:12:57.620 align:middle line:84%
she lived in the same
house for 40 years.

00:12:57.620 --> 00:13:00.439 align:middle line:84%
And the value of the house
went through the roof.

00:13:00.439 --> 00:13:01.980 align:middle line:84%
And even when it
did, she didn't want

00:13:01.980 --> 00:13:04.380 align:middle line:84%
to sell it or move because
she was very comfortable.

00:13:04.380 --> 00:13:05.390 align:middle line:90%
She was very fixed.

00:13:05.390 --> 00:13:08.925 align:middle line:84%
And she was very set in where
she wanted to live and continue

00:13:08.925 --> 00:13:09.800 align:middle line:90%
the rest of her life.

00:13:09.800 --> 00:13:13.830 align:middle line:84%
So that's one element in how
the fixed aspect of Taurus

00:13:13.830 --> 00:13:15.050 align:middle line:90%
can become manifest.

00:13:15.050 --> 00:13:16.860 align:middle line:90%
Another is routine.

00:13:16.860 --> 00:13:19.370 align:middle line:84%
And certainly, Taurus
can have their routines,

00:13:19.370 --> 00:13:22.370 align:middle line:84%
whether it's exercise
routine or diet routine.

00:13:22.370 --> 00:13:24.040 align:middle line:84%
And once they get
those routines down,

00:13:24.040 --> 00:13:26.550 align:middle line:84%
they like to continue
to keep them going

00:13:26.550 --> 00:13:28.320 align:middle line:84%
and make them a
part of their lives.

00:13:28.320 --> 00:13:30.600 align:middle line:84%
So therefore, they become
part of their fixed rhythm.

00:13:30.600 --> 00:13:32.641 align:middle line:84%
Let's look at some of the
key words and strengths

00:13:32.641 --> 00:13:40.030 align:middle line:84%
for Taurus-- dependable, loyal,
persistent, committed, earthy,

00:13:40.030 --> 00:13:43.040 align:middle line:90%
sensual, money-wise, grounded.

00:13:43.040 --> 00:13:46.330 align:middle line:84%
If you ever want to learn about
money, hang out with a Taurus,

00:13:46.330 --> 00:13:49.950 align:middle line:84%
because a Taurus understands
money in a way that a lot

00:13:49.950 --> 00:13:51.370 align:middle line:90%
of other signs don't.

00:13:51.370 --> 00:13:52.989 align:middle line:90%
Scorpio understands money.

00:13:52.989 --> 00:13:54.530 align:middle line:84%
They understand
other people's money,

00:13:54.530 --> 00:13:56.387 align:middle line:84%
but Taurus understands
the value of money.

00:13:56.387 --> 00:13:57.970 align:middle line:84%
And when we get into
the houses, we're

00:13:57.970 --> 00:13:59.940 align:middle line:84%
going to look at
each house later on,

00:13:59.940 --> 00:14:02.390 align:middle line:84%
and we're going to break
down what those houses mean

00:14:02.390 --> 00:14:05.375 align:middle line:84%
and what the sign values
for those houses are.

00:14:05.375 --> 00:14:06.750 align:middle line:84%
And one of the
things that you'll

00:14:06.750 --> 00:14:09.650 align:middle line:84%
see with the second house, which
is representative of Taurus,

00:14:09.650 --> 00:14:12.440 align:middle line:84%
is the whole notion
and concept of value

00:14:12.440 --> 00:14:14.370 align:middle line:84%
and what that means in
the individual's life.

00:14:14.370 --> 00:14:17.510 align:middle line:84%
Taurus also rules
the first chakra.

00:14:17.510 --> 00:14:20.400 align:middle line:84%
They're very, very grounded
in terms of how they move

00:14:20.400 --> 00:14:23.010 align:middle line:84%
and how they groove and how
they live across the planet.

00:14:23.010 --> 00:14:25.640 align:middle line:84%
And they can be very
detail-oriented, as well.

00:14:25.640 --> 00:14:28.330 align:middle line:84%
As long as they can continue
to keep their momentum

00:14:28.330 --> 00:14:30.400 align:middle line:84%
going and their
energy up, they can

00:14:30.400 --> 00:14:34.200 align:middle line:84%
be very detail-oriented
and on task.

00:14:34.200 --> 00:14:36.840 align:middle line:84%
The weaknesses for
the key words here

00:14:36.840 --> 00:14:43.220 align:middle line:84%
are the stubborn, lazy,
possessive, self indulgent,

00:14:43.220 --> 00:14:45.470 align:middle line:90%
obsessive, materialistic.

00:14:45.470 --> 00:14:47.240 align:middle line:90%
And I put indulgent in there.

00:14:47.240 --> 00:14:50.340 align:middle line:84%
I think I want the Tauruses
out there to get this.

00:14:50.340 --> 00:14:51.760 align:middle line:90%
I put it in there twice.

00:14:51.760 --> 00:14:58.350 align:middle line:84%
So there's a quality
here with the-- it's not

00:14:58.350 --> 00:15:03.090 align:middle line:84%
as though Taurus has an egoic
personification with any

00:15:03.090 --> 00:15:03.930 align:middle line:90%
of these qualities.

00:15:03.930 --> 00:15:05.830 align:middle line:84%
In fact, none of
the signs really

00:15:05.830 --> 00:15:08.590 align:middle line:84%
have an egoic personification
or relationship

00:15:08.590 --> 00:15:10.750 align:middle line:90%
with any of these aspects.

00:15:10.750 --> 00:15:15.810 align:middle line:84%
It's really just kind of a
manifestation of the individual

00:15:15.810 --> 00:15:19.340 align:middle line:84%
and the energy related to the
sign that may not necessarily

00:15:19.340 --> 00:15:20.590 align:middle line:90%
be as conscious.

00:15:20.590 --> 00:15:23.530 align:middle line:84%
Or they may not be
as consciously aware

00:15:23.530 --> 00:15:25.610 align:middle line:84%
of what's taking
place in their lives

00:15:25.610 --> 00:15:29.200 align:middle line:84%
as a result of either
conditioning or training,

00:15:29.200 --> 00:15:32.300 align:middle line:84%
or even from an astrological
perspective, transits

00:15:32.300 --> 00:15:34.361 align:middle line:90%
as they relate to their aspects.

00:15:34.361 --> 00:15:35.860 align:middle line:84%
So these are just
some of the things

00:15:35.860 --> 00:15:40.520 align:middle line:84%
that a Taurus person can
look out for in their lives.

00:15:40.520 --> 00:15:42.230 align:middle line:84%
The cultural ciphers
for Taurus-- I

00:15:42.230 --> 00:15:43.800 align:middle line:90%
put Dennis Hopper in there.

00:15:43.800 --> 00:15:44.530 align:middle line:90%
He's a Taurus.

00:15:44.530 --> 00:15:46.030 align:middle line:84%
And he's really,
really interesting,

00:15:46.030 --> 00:15:48.320 align:middle line:84%
because what he did
is while he was alive,

00:15:48.320 --> 00:15:53.430 align:middle line:84%
he accrued one of the largest
private art collections.

00:15:53.430 --> 00:15:56.770 align:middle line:84%
I think the other guy that
has an extremely large art

00:15:56.770 --> 00:15:58.670 align:middle line:90%
collection is Steve Martin.

00:15:58.670 --> 00:16:00.600 align:middle line:84%
And if I'm not mistaken,
I think Steve Martin

00:16:00.600 --> 00:16:01.767 align:middle line:90%
is a Taurus as well.

00:16:01.767 --> 00:16:04.100 align:middle line:84%
So here, we see, between
Dennis Hopper and Steve Martin,

00:16:04.100 --> 00:16:07.090 align:middle line:84%
two individuals that
really like physical goods.

00:16:07.090 --> 00:16:08.850 align:middle line:90%
They like art.

00:16:08.850 --> 00:16:10.390 align:middle line:90%
Art appreciates in value.

00:16:10.390 --> 00:16:12.410 align:middle line:84%
Taurus knows the
value of a dollar.

00:16:12.410 --> 00:16:18.360 align:middle line:84%
And I think Hopper was also
in the film about Jean-Michel

00:16:18.360 --> 00:16:19.530 align:middle line:90%
Basquiat.

00:16:19.530 --> 00:16:21.510 align:middle line:90%
He played an art dealer in that.

00:16:21.510 --> 00:16:26.060 align:middle line:84%
So Dennis Hopper-- a
cultural cipher for Taurus.

00:16:26.060 --> 00:16:28.850 align:middle line:84%
King Solomon, going
way back into history--

00:16:28.850 --> 00:16:31.060 align:middle line:90%
another cipher for Taurus.

00:16:31.060 --> 00:16:34.210 align:middle line:84%
Gold-- Taurus is related
to the elements--

00:16:34.210 --> 00:16:36.650 align:middle line:90%
gold, silver, copper.

00:16:36.650 --> 00:16:39.670 align:middle line:84%
You name it, if it
comes out of the earth,

00:16:39.670 --> 00:16:41.240 align:middle line:84%
it's part of
Taurus's real estate.

00:16:41.240 --> 00:16:45.057 align:middle line:84%
And gold is a prime
example of that.

00:16:45.057 --> 00:16:46.640 align:middle line:84%
Pamplona-- where
they have the Running

00:16:46.640 --> 00:16:47.990 align:middle line:90%
of the Bulls-- of course.

00:16:47.990 --> 00:16:49.700 align:middle line:90%
That's a symbol of Taurus.

00:16:49.700 --> 00:16:57.300 align:middle line:84%
And the ancient culture that
has been derived around Pamplona

00:16:57.300 --> 00:16:59.660 align:middle line:84%
and the bull and
everything that's

00:16:59.660 --> 00:17:02.790 align:middle line:84%
related to not just
the Spanish culture

00:17:02.790 --> 00:17:06.415 align:middle line:84%
but also the Greek culture,
where we have King Minos, which

00:17:06.415 --> 00:17:07.790 align:middle line:84%
I think I have in
here somewhere.

00:17:07.790 --> 00:17:08.665 align:middle line:90%
Maybe I moved it out.

00:17:08.665 --> 00:17:11.569 align:middle line:84%
Here he is right next to
Pamplona-- King Minos.

00:17:11.569 --> 00:17:13.760 align:middle line:90%
Brian Eno is a Taurus.

00:17:13.760 --> 00:17:15.640 align:middle line:84%
And the reason I
put him in there

00:17:15.640 --> 00:17:19.440 align:middle line:84%
is because Brian Eno
really kind of typifies

00:17:19.440 --> 00:17:21.300 align:middle line:90%
a Taurian sensibility.

00:17:21.300 --> 00:17:26.680 align:middle line:84%
There's a documentary that
Eno did maybe a little bit

00:17:26.680 --> 00:17:28.030 align:middle line:90%
over a decade ago.

00:17:28.030 --> 00:17:30.760 align:middle line:84%
And I think it's called
"Oblique Strategies."

00:17:30.760 --> 00:17:36.430 align:middle line:84%
Anyway, he talks about
his concept of music.

00:17:36.430 --> 00:17:39.990 align:middle line:84%
And when you are involved in the
production of electronic music,

00:17:39.990 --> 00:17:41.470 align:middle line:84%
you have synthesizers
and all kinds

00:17:41.470 --> 00:17:43.870 align:middle line:90%
of crazy patches and samples.

00:17:43.870 --> 00:17:46.030 align:middle line:84%
And you can have
so many options.

00:17:46.030 --> 00:17:48.680 align:middle line:84%
You can have banks and banks
and banks of synthesizers.

00:17:48.680 --> 00:17:51.950 align:middle line:84%
But what Eno said in this
documentary is he said,

00:17:51.950 --> 00:17:55.767 align:middle line:84%
just give me six or seven
really good options.

00:17:55.767 --> 00:17:57.600 align:middle line:84%
Just give me something
that's really simple,

00:17:57.600 --> 00:17:59.100 align:middle line:90%
but give me the best.

00:17:59.100 --> 00:18:04.570 align:middle line:84%
That's a very Taurian kind
of relationship to technology

00:18:04.570 --> 00:18:07.600 align:middle line:84%
and sound-- not a lot,
but make it the best.

00:18:07.600 --> 00:18:10.460 align:middle line:84%
The other thing that Eno does,
which is kind of interesting,

00:18:10.460 --> 00:18:12.930 align:middle line:84%
is that he creates his
own perfumes, which

00:18:12.930 --> 00:18:15.220 align:middle line:90%
is also a very Taurian exercise.

00:18:15.220 --> 00:18:20.160 align:middle line:84%
He's working with essential
oils and pastes and essences

00:18:20.160 --> 00:18:21.430 align:middle line:90%
and things like that.

00:18:21.430 --> 00:18:22.990 align:middle line:90%
Incense is very Taurus.

00:18:22.990 --> 00:18:27.140 align:middle line:84%
Folk music-- really
simple, heartfelt,

00:18:27.140 --> 00:18:31.160 align:middle line:84%
folk music from around the
world, folk music in the United

00:18:31.160 --> 00:18:33.640 align:middle line:84%
States, roots music,
things like that.

00:18:33.640 --> 00:18:36.970 align:middle line:84%
Tectonic plates are also
symbolic of Taurus--

00:18:36.970 --> 00:18:39.190 align:middle line:84%
what's happening beneath
the surface of things.

00:18:39.190 --> 00:18:40.800 align:middle line:84%
Wedding bands--
and I'm not talking

00:18:40.800 --> 00:18:43.410 align:middle line:84%
about bands that
play at your wedding,

00:18:43.410 --> 00:18:47.090 align:middle line:84%
but actual gold wedding bands--
symbolic of Taurus, as well.

00:18:47.090 --> 00:18:51.740 align:middle line:84%
Venus of Willendorf-- of course,
the big, beautiful ancient

00:18:51.740 --> 00:18:54.180 align:middle line:90%
symbol of Venus.

00:18:54.180 --> 00:18:56.770 align:middle line:84%
And then we also have here at
the bottom, the highest octave.

00:18:56.770 --> 00:18:59.170 align:middle line:84%
"The Body is the temple of
the soul," because Taurus

00:18:59.170 --> 00:19:01.520 align:middle line:84%
is connected to the
body, so why not

00:19:01.520 --> 00:19:04.510 align:middle line:84%
treat the body like you treat
the soul and vice versa?

00:19:04.510 --> 00:19:07.444 align:middle line:84%
Here, we have the merging of the
higher and the lower together

00:19:07.444 --> 00:19:09.110 align:middle line:84%
or the inner and the
outer-- however way

00:19:09.110 --> 00:19:11.190 align:middle line:90%
you want to slice and dice that.

00:19:11.190 --> 00:19:13.480 align:middle line:84%
It's about the
conscious realization

00:19:13.480 --> 00:19:14.850 align:middle line:90%
that the two are one.

00:19:14.850 --> 00:19:18.210 align:middle line:84%
This is where it all takes
place-- in the sign of Taurus.

00:19:18.210 --> 00:19:18.710 align:middle line:90%
All right.

00:19:18.710 --> 00:19:21.940 align:middle line:84%
Moving onto Gemini, the twins--
fascinating sign, Gemini.

00:19:21.940 --> 00:19:25.250 align:middle line:90%
We have May 21 to June 22.

00:19:25.250 --> 00:19:27.710 align:middle line:90%
The element of Gemini is air.

00:19:27.710 --> 00:19:30.010 align:middle line:84%
It's the first air
sign in the zodiac.

00:19:30.010 --> 00:19:31.940 align:middle line:84%
The energy is
mutable, just like it

00:19:31.940 --> 00:19:36.490 align:middle line:84%
is with Virgo and
Sagittarius and Pisces.

00:19:36.490 --> 00:19:41.760 align:middle line:84%
The key words for Gemini, on
the positive tip, are curious,

00:19:41.760 --> 00:19:45.410 align:middle line:84%
genius-- Geminis are
very, very smart.

00:19:45.410 --> 00:19:49.940 align:middle line:84%
Articulation-- they have a
fascination and an ability

00:19:49.940 --> 00:19:52.670 align:middle line:84%
to not only speak
their own language

00:19:52.670 --> 00:19:55.290 align:middle line:84%
but learn other
languages as well.

00:19:55.290 --> 00:19:58.770 align:middle line:84%
Clever, witty--
they're very fun.

00:19:58.770 --> 00:20:00.730 align:middle line:90%
They're experimental.

00:20:00.730 --> 00:20:02.080 align:middle line:90%
They like to play with things.

00:20:02.080 --> 00:20:05.669 align:middle line:84%
They don't really
have a lot of-- what's

00:20:05.669 --> 00:20:06.710 align:middle line:90%
the word I'm looking for?

00:20:06.710 --> 00:20:08.660 align:middle line:84%
They don't really have
a lot of attachment

00:20:08.660 --> 00:20:12.670 align:middle line:84%
as to how things work or look
at any given point in time.

00:20:12.670 --> 00:20:14.750 align:middle line:84%
They like to combine
certain elements.

00:20:14.750 --> 00:20:16.670 align:middle line:84%
They like to combine
certain types

00:20:16.670 --> 00:20:21.870 align:middle line:84%
of art or certain types
of different techniques

00:20:21.870 --> 00:20:24.880 align:middle line:84%
or different types of strategies
just to see how they mesh,

00:20:24.880 --> 00:20:26.710 align:middle line:90%
to see how they work.

00:20:26.710 --> 00:20:27.570 align:middle line:90%
What else are they?

00:20:27.570 --> 00:20:29.250 align:middle line:84%
Well, they're fairly
objective, as well.

00:20:29.250 --> 00:20:30.730 align:middle line:90%
They like to step back.

00:20:30.730 --> 00:20:33.490 align:middle line:84%
And I think of all the signs,
the two most voyeuristic

00:20:33.490 --> 00:20:36.760 align:middle line:84%
in some ways are
Gemini and Aquarius.

00:20:36.760 --> 00:20:41.080 align:middle line:84%
And the reason why Gemini is
voyeuristic is because it has

00:20:41.080 --> 00:20:45.910 align:middle line:84%
a unique capacity to learn
from itself in a way that other

00:20:45.910 --> 00:20:46.950 align:middle line:90%
signs don't.

00:20:46.950 --> 00:20:51.930 align:middle line:84%
There's almost a kind of a split
persona inside the individual,

00:20:51.930 --> 00:20:55.800 align:middle line:84%
where there is a witness
self that is always

00:20:55.800 --> 00:20:58.800 align:middle line:84%
just off to the side
trying to understand

00:20:58.800 --> 00:21:02.560 align:middle line:84%
and trying to take notes on
this human experience of being

00:21:02.560 --> 00:21:03.770 align:middle line:90%
a Gemini.

00:21:03.770 --> 00:21:06.940 align:middle line:84%
It's fascinating because
Libra is similar.

00:21:06.940 --> 00:21:11.210 align:middle line:84%
But unlike Gemini, Libra likes
to interact with another person

00:21:11.210 --> 00:21:12.710 align:middle line:84%
in order to find
out who they are.

00:21:12.710 --> 00:21:14.580 align:middle line:84%
Gemini-- that split
actually takes

00:21:14.580 --> 00:21:16.200 align:middle line:90%
place inside of themselves.

00:21:16.200 --> 00:21:18.690 align:middle line:84%
So that's why a
Gemini will sometimes

00:21:18.690 --> 00:21:20.460 align:middle line:84%
display various
character traits,

00:21:20.460 --> 00:21:24.270 align:middle line:84%
and may even show up as a
different person from time

00:21:24.270 --> 00:21:25.500 align:middle line:90%
to time.

00:21:25.500 --> 00:21:26.460 align:middle line:90%
Don't worry about it.

00:21:26.460 --> 00:21:27.543 align:middle line:90%
They're not schizophrenic.

00:21:27.543 --> 00:21:29.140 align:middle line:90%
They're just being a Gemini.

00:21:29.140 --> 00:21:31.510 align:middle line:84%
Keywords-- the negative
aspects of Gemini

00:21:31.510 --> 00:21:37.180 align:middle line:84%
are superficial,
impulsive, restless.

00:21:37.180 --> 00:21:40.380 align:middle line:84%
There could be a bit of
dishonesty with Gemini.

00:21:40.380 --> 00:21:43.330 align:middle line:84%
Detached, two
faced-- there we have

00:21:43.330 --> 00:21:49.070 align:middle line:84%
the image of Janus, the figure
with two faces, very Gemini.

00:21:49.070 --> 00:21:50.860 align:middle line:84%
Geminis can be a little
on the cool side,

00:21:50.860 --> 00:21:56.280 align:middle line:84%
because all the air signs have
a quality of detachment to them.

00:21:56.280 --> 00:22:00.940 align:middle line:84%
So Gemini will personify that
detachment in its own way,

00:22:00.940 --> 00:22:03.820 align:middle line:84%
just like Libra has its
own version of detachment

00:22:03.820 --> 00:22:07.680 align:middle line:84%
and Aquarius has its own
version of detachment as well.

00:22:07.680 --> 00:22:10.220 align:middle line:84%
And Geminis can
be a manipulative,

00:22:10.220 --> 00:22:13.196 align:middle line:90%
too, believe it or not.

00:22:13.196 --> 00:22:15.460 align:middle line:84%
Thy don't have the
patent on manipulation.

00:22:15.460 --> 00:22:17.230 align:middle line:90%
Any sign can be manipulative.

00:22:17.230 --> 00:22:20.200 align:middle line:84%
But because Gemini
has such a facility

00:22:20.200 --> 00:22:23.380 align:middle line:84%
of playing with
reality, whether it's

00:22:23.380 --> 00:22:27.220 align:middle line:84%
with words or
concepts or technology

00:22:27.220 --> 00:22:30.950 align:middle line:84%
or just being smarter than
other people, to a large extent,

00:22:30.950 --> 00:22:33.630 align:middle line:84%
there can be a
manipulative side to them,

00:22:33.630 --> 00:22:35.820 align:middle line:84%
even if they're not
quite aware of it.

00:22:35.820 --> 00:22:38.350 align:middle line:84%
One of the things that
Geminis have to watch out for

00:22:38.350 --> 00:22:39.850 align:middle line:90%
is this restlessness.

00:22:39.850 --> 00:22:43.670 align:middle line:90%
And I saw this at work.

00:22:43.670 --> 00:22:44.550 align:middle line:90%
He wasn't a Gemini.

00:22:44.550 --> 00:22:47.430 align:middle line:84%
He was a Taurus, but
he had Mars in Gemini,

00:22:47.430 --> 00:22:48.970 align:middle line:90%
which is very restless.

00:22:48.970 --> 00:22:51.900 align:middle line:84%
It's one of the most restless
aspects in the zodiac.

00:22:51.900 --> 00:22:54.280 align:middle line:84%
And it was the coach of
the Golden State Warriors.

00:22:54.280 --> 00:22:55.690 align:middle line:90%
His name was Don Nelson.

00:22:55.690 --> 00:22:57.280 align:middle line:90%
And he was brilliant.

00:22:57.280 --> 00:22:58.910 align:middle line:90%
He was a brilliant coach.

00:22:58.910 --> 00:23:02.150 align:middle line:84%
But he was always
changing his strategy.

00:23:02.150 --> 00:23:04.010 align:middle line:84%
He was always
changing his players.

00:23:04.010 --> 00:23:06.360 align:middle line:84%
He was always changing
things because once he

00:23:06.360 --> 00:23:08.390 align:middle line:84%
got to a certain
point where it worked,

00:23:08.390 --> 00:23:10.330 align:middle line:84%
he wanted to break
it all down again

00:23:10.330 --> 00:23:13.030 align:middle line:84%
and then start over just
because he was bored.

00:23:13.030 --> 00:23:17.080 align:middle line:84%
So there's a quality of boredom
that can set in with Geminis.

00:23:17.080 --> 00:23:19.510 align:middle line:84%
Prince is actually a pretty
good example of that as well.

00:23:19.510 --> 00:23:21.680 align:middle line:84%
If you've ever seen
Prince in concert

00:23:21.680 --> 00:23:24.530 align:middle line:84%
and you want to see Prince
play his hits, you'll see them,

00:23:24.530 --> 00:23:27.580 align:middle line:84%
but he'll play them all in
a span of about 15 minutes.

00:23:27.580 --> 00:23:30.500 align:middle line:84%
Every single song that
is a hit for Prince

00:23:30.500 --> 00:23:31.720 align:middle line:90%
is part of a Prince medley.

00:23:31.720 --> 00:23:33.850 align:middle line:90%
It's a very Gemini thing to do.

00:23:33.850 --> 00:23:36.512 align:middle line:84%
So some of the cultural
ciphers for Gemini I think

00:23:36.512 --> 00:23:37.470 align:middle line:90%
are really fascinating.

00:23:37.470 --> 00:23:40.790 align:middle line:84%
First of all, we
have the Twin Towers,

00:23:40.790 --> 00:23:43.210 align:middle line:84%
which are no longer the
Twin Towers, but certainly

00:23:43.210 --> 00:23:44.670 align:middle line:90%
an aspect of Gemini.

00:23:44.670 --> 00:23:46.370 align:middle line:84%
Plastic Macca,
for all of you who

00:23:46.370 --> 00:23:48.240 align:middle line:84%
know what I'm talking about,
I don't have to say any more.

00:23:48.240 --> 00:23:49.698 align:middle line:84%
But for those of
you who don't, I'm

00:23:49.698 --> 00:23:52.720 align:middle line:84%
referring to Paul
McCartney, who is a Gemini

00:23:52.720 --> 00:23:56.700 align:middle line:84%
and also rumored to be
perhaps not the original Paul

00:23:56.700 --> 00:23:57.240 align:middle line:90%
McCartney.

00:23:57.240 --> 00:24:01.316 align:middle line:84%
So Plastic Macca is
an image of Gemini.

00:24:01.316 --> 00:24:03.440 align:middle line:84%
What's fascinating about
that is that he's a Gemini

00:24:03.440 --> 00:24:04.839 align:middle line:90%
and there's two Pauls.

00:24:04.839 --> 00:24:05.630 align:middle line:90%
Play with that one.

00:24:05.630 --> 00:24:07.546 align:middle line:84%
Let that roll around in
your head for a while.

00:24:07.546 --> 00:24:10.600 align:middle line:84%
Marilyn Monroe, a Gemini
as well-- so was JFK.

00:24:10.600 --> 00:24:12.250 align:middle line:90%
We've talked about that before.

00:24:12.250 --> 00:24:14.690 align:middle line:90%
Batman-- I thought about Batman.

00:24:14.690 --> 00:24:16.910 align:middle line:84%
And I thought Batman was
really kind of unique

00:24:16.910 --> 00:24:18.980 align:middle line:84%
in terms of being
a Gemini because

00:24:18.980 --> 00:24:21.840 align:middle line:84%
of this whole identity
around being a superhero.

00:24:21.840 --> 00:24:25.710 align:middle line:84%
In fact, the whole concept of
superhero or being a superhero

00:24:25.710 --> 00:24:29.800 align:middle line:84%
is very Gemini, because the
superhero has an identity

00:24:29.800 --> 00:24:30.930 align:middle line:90%
and has the alter ego.

00:24:30.930 --> 00:24:33.240 align:middle line:84%
There's the superhero and
then there's the other.

00:24:33.240 --> 00:24:37.000 align:middle line:84%
So there's this real dance
with this whole culture

00:24:37.000 --> 00:24:40.060 align:middle line:84%
of being a superhero
or the persona

00:24:40.060 --> 00:24:42.760 align:middle line:84%
or the myth of the
superhero in our culture.

00:24:42.760 --> 00:24:46.680 align:middle line:84%
It's very much connected
to the sign of Gemini.

00:24:46.680 --> 00:24:48.250 align:middle line:90%
Kanye West is a Gemini.

00:24:48.250 --> 00:24:51.889 align:middle line:84%
And I brought him in
here because number one,

00:24:51.889 --> 00:24:52.930 align:middle line:90%
I think he's interesting.

00:24:52.930 --> 00:24:54.640 align:middle line:84%
I don't always agree
with his scene,

00:24:54.640 --> 00:24:56.140 align:middle line:84%
but I think he's
really interesting.

00:24:56.140 --> 00:24:57.348 align:middle line:90%
I think he's really talented.

00:24:57.348 --> 00:25:00.100 align:middle line:84%
He's a Gemini, another
guy who is very restless.

00:25:00.100 --> 00:25:03.260 align:middle line:84%
And he personifies
this restlessness,

00:25:03.260 --> 00:25:05.900 align:middle line:84%
both in his personal
life and in his art.

00:25:05.900 --> 00:25:08.890 align:middle line:84%
Then he also has this kind
of dual persona going on.

00:25:08.890 --> 00:25:11.610 align:middle line:84%
There's Kanye and then
there's Black Yeezus.

00:25:11.610 --> 00:25:14.420 align:middle line:84%
So I thought he was an
interesting cultural cipher.

00:25:14.420 --> 00:25:17.340 align:middle line:84%
Clones-- clones are
another aspect of Gemini,

00:25:17.340 --> 00:25:22.450 align:middle line:84%
the manipulation of
DNA and the splicing

00:25:22.450 --> 00:25:26.660 align:middle line:90%
the genes and the other clones.

00:25:26.660 --> 00:25:30.490 align:middle line:84%
MK Ultra-- if you are
into alternate research

00:25:30.490 --> 00:25:32.380 align:middle line:84%
and you have gone
down that rabbit hole,

00:25:32.380 --> 00:25:36.390 align:middle line:84%
you understand about
what MK Ultra is.

00:25:36.390 --> 00:25:38.020 align:middle line:84%
There are a lot of
aspects to MK Ultra,

00:25:38.020 --> 00:25:40.130 align:middle line:84%
but I'm really
specifically talking

00:25:40.130 --> 00:25:45.280 align:middle line:84%
about the component where an
individual is altered-- where

00:25:45.280 --> 00:25:47.850 align:middle line:84%
they're traumatized and
they have sub-personalities

00:25:47.850 --> 00:25:50.200 align:middle line:84%
and they wind up being
more than one person

00:25:50.200 --> 00:25:53.680 align:middle line:84%
or they have compartmentalized
personalities--

00:25:53.680 --> 00:25:55.259 align:middle line:84%
very much associated
with Gemini.

00:25:55.259 --> 00:25:57.050 align:middle line:84%
Speaking of which,
there's the Olsen twins.

00:25:57.050 --> 00:25:59.600 align:middle line:90%


00:25:59.600 --> 00:26:02.600 align:middle line:84%
First of all, they're twins and
second of all, they're Geminis.

00:26:02.600 --> 00:26:04.170 align:middle line:90%
So they fit in quite well here.

00:26:04.170 --> 00:26:07.490 align:middle line:84%
Edward Snowden-- he's right
there, 29 degrees Gemini.

00:26:07.490 --> 00:26:08.700 align:middle line:90%
And what is he doing?

00:26:08.700 --> 00:26:10.290 align:middle line:90%
He's involved in spy craft.

00:26:10.290 --> 00:26:13.940 align:middle line:84%
He's involved in
sharing information,

00:26:13.940 --> 00:26:17.810 align:middle line:84%
whether it's legal or
illegal or illicit.

00:26:17.810 --> 00:26:21.900 align:middle line:84%
He certainly personifies
this whole notion

00:26:21.900 --> 00:26:24.284 align:middle line:84%
of Gemini and Gemini
related to spy craft.

00:26:24.284 --> 00:26:25.950 align:middle line:84%
Prince-- we've already
talked about him.

00:26:25.950 --> 00:26:30.210 align:middle line:84%
And Angelina Jolie--
yes, she is a Gemini.

00:26:30.210 --> 00:26:37.640 align:middle line:84%
So the highest
octave for Gemini is

00:26:37.640 --> 00:26:40.330 align:middle line:84%
"To know the self as
the other and the self."

00:26:40.330 --> 00:26:40.990 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:26:40.990 --> 00:26:42.850 align:middle line:84%
I'll read it again--
"To know the self

00:26:42.850 --> 00:26:44.400 align:middle line:90%
as the other and the self."

00:26:44.400 --> 00:26:45.980 align:middle line:90%
So it's kind of convoluted.

00:26:45.980 --> 00:26:48.420 align:middle line:84%
But if you think about it,
for Gemini, it actually

00:26:48.420 --> 00:26:51.309 align:middle line:84%
makes a lot of sense,
because by knowing the other

00:26:51.309 --> 00:26:53.350 align:middle line:84%
as part of the self, well,
they know the totality

00:26:53.350 --> 00:26:56.000 align:middle line:84%
of the self in their
own unique Gemini way.

00:26:56.000 --> 00:26:56.500 align:middle line:90%
All right.

00:26:56.500 --> 00:26:58.140 align:middle line:90%
Let's move on to the next sign.

00:26:58.140 --> 00:27:02.420 align:middle line:84%
OK, Cancer-- the crab,
June 21 to July 22.

00:27:02.420 --> 00:27:04.580 align:middle line:90%
Of course, the element is water.

00:27:04.580 --> 00:27:07.840 align:middle line:84%
And here, we have our
first cardinal sign.

00:27:07.840 --> 00:27:09.220 align:middle line:90%
Sorry-- second cardinal sign.

00:27:09.220 --> 00:27:10.180 align:middle line:90%
Our first was Aries.

00:27:10.180 --> 00:27:11.550 align:middle line:90%
So the energy is cardinal.

00:27:11.550 --> 00:27:17.240 align:middle line:84%
The keywords-- the strengths
of being a Cancer are caring.

00:27:17.240 --> 00:27:20.600 align:middle line:84%
There's a sense of nostalgia
that Cancers bring along

00:27:20.600 --> 00:27:22.530 align:middle line:84%
with them, which
helps them in terms

00:27:22.530 --> 00:27:26.630 align:middle line:84%
of being rooted and creating
families and things like that.

00:27:26.630 --> 00:27:28.996 align:middle line:90%
They can be a bit sentimental.

00:27:28.996 --> 00:27:30.370 align:middle line:84%
That may or may
no be a strength.

00:27:30.370 --> 00:27:32.840 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes, it can be
a bit of a weakness.

00:27:32.840 --> 00:27:34.119 align:middle line:90%
Certainly, they're thrifty.

00:27:34.119 --> 00:27:36.160 align:middle line:84%
That's another sign that's
quite good with money.

00:27:36.160 --> 00:27:39.310 align:middle line:84%
You give a Cancer
$20 and they'll

00:27:39.310 --> 00:27:40.510 align:middle line:90%
buy groceries for the week.

00:27:40.510 --> 00:27:42.980 align:middle line:84%
They'll make you a soup and
will have money left over.

00:27:42.980 --> 00:27:44.890 align:middle line:84%
That's what they're
really good at.

00:27:44.890 --> 00:27:46.010 align:middle line:90%
They're psychic.

00:27:46.010 --> 00:27:48.100 align:middle line:90%
They're the first water sign.

00:27:48.100 --> 00:27:50.650 align:middle line:84%
So they tend to be
intuitive and psychic

00:27:50.650 --> 00:27:53.310 align:middle line:90%
and live with sense impressions.

00:27:53.310 --> 00:27:55.630 align:middle line:84%
They have a really healing
quality about them.

00:27:55.630 --> 00:27:57.970 align:middle line:84%
If you've ever spent any
time around a Cancer,

00:27:57.970 --> 00:27:59.570 align:middle line:90%
they can be very receptive.

00:27:59.570 --> 00:28:00.840 align:middle line:90%
They can be very quiet.

00:28:00.840 --> 00:28:03.700 align:middle line:84%
And when they're quiet,
they're really good listeners.

00:28:03.700 --> 00:28:07.010 align:middle line:84%
They're some of the best
listeners in the zodiac.

00:28:07.010 --> 00:28:10.490 align:middle line:84%
And there's a very profound
human quality to being heard.

00:28:10.490 --> 00:28:12.450 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes, they don't
have to touch you.

00:28:12.450 --> 00:28:14.190 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes, they don't have
to cook anything for you.

00:28:14.190 --> 00:28:16.100 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes, they can
just sit across from you

00:28:16.100 --> 00:28:20.420 align:middle line:84%
and allow you to speak
and to emote and to share

00:28:20.420 --> 00:28:22.180 align:middle line:84%
and to communicate
and to be heard.

00:28:22.180 --> 00:28:25.090 align:middle line:84%
It's a really powerful
and potent form

00:28:25.090 --> 00:28:28.140 align:middle line:84%
of healing for the
Cancer individual.

00:28:28.140 --> 00:28:29.380 align:middle line:90%
They're rootsy.

00:28:29.380 --> 00:28:31.540 align:middle line:90%
They enjoy things like fabrics.

00:28:31.540 --> 00:28:35.260 align:middle line:84%
And they're sort of
connected in some ways

00:28:35.260 --> 00:28:37.850 align:middle line:90%
to Taurus in that sense.

00:28:37.850 --> 00:28:43.180 align:middle line:84%
But they're able to do things
with fabrics and with paint

00:28:43.180 --> 00:28:44.530 align:middle line:90%
and with wood.

00:28:44.530 --> 00:28:46.540 align:middle line:84%
They tend to be very
good with their hands.

00:28:46.540 --> 00:28:49.250 align:middle line:90%
They tend to be pretty craftsy.

00:28:49.250 --> 00:28:52.600 align:middle line:84%
If you know somebody
who can pick a tool

00:28:52.600 --> 00:28:55.700 align:middle line:84%
and fix something and do it
pretty quickly without a lot

00:28:55.700 --> 00:28:58.260 align:middle line:84%
of fuss, there's probably
a pretty good chance

00:28:58.260 --> 00:28:59.650 align:middle line:90%
that they're a Cancer.

00:28:59.650 --> 00:29:01.040 align:middle line:90%
They tend to be very maternal.

00:29:01.040 --> 00:29:02.986 align:middle line:84%
Even the males tend
to be maternal.

00:29:02.986 --> 00:29:03.860 align:middle line:90%
They like to nurture.

00:29:03.860 --> 00:29:05.170 align:middle line:90%
They like to care.

00:29:05.170 --> 00:29:06.305 align:middle line:90%
They like to grow things.

00:29:06.305 --> 00:29:07.430 align:middle line:90%
And that could be anything.

00:29:07.430 --> 00:29:11.180 align:middle line:84%
It could be a household, a
family, a garden, a business,

00:29:11.180 --> 00:29:13.190 align:middle line:90%
a career, a profession.

00:29:13.190 --> 00:29:17.610 align:middle line:84%
So when a Cancer gets engaged
in some form of activity

00:29:17.610 --> 00:29:20.650 align:middle line:84%
or vocation, the approach
that they'll take

00:29:20.650 --> 00:29:24.820 align:middle line:84%
is one that's quite
organic and very nurturing

00:29:24.820 --> 00:29:27.390 align:middle line:84%
and taking time
to put the time in

00:29:27.390 --> 00:29:30.530 align:middle line:84%
to make sure that
newsletters are sent out.

00:29:30.530 --> 00:29:36.460 align:middle line:84%
It's a very conscious,
very aware and very caring

00:29:36.460 --> 00:29:38.730 align:middle line:84%
way for the individual
to make sure

00:29:38.730 --> 00:29:41.881 align:middle line:84%
that their career and their
life keeps moving forward.

00:29:41.881 --> 00:29:42.380 align:middle line:90%
Here we go.

00:29:42.380 --> 00:29:44.070 align:middle line:90%
They're nurturing and maternal.

00:29:44.070 --> 00:29:46.250 align:middle line:84%
Those are the key
words for Cancer.

00:29:46.250 --> 00:29:50.340 align:middle line:84%
The weaknesses--
now, if you've ever

00:29:50.340 --> 00:29:53.950 align:middle line:84%
had a person that you've had a
really difficult time breaking

00:29:53.950 --> 00:29:56.660 align:middle line:84%
up with, that they
just won't leave,

00:29:56.660 --> 00:30:00.950 align:middle line:84%
very good chance, I hate to say
it, they're probably a Cancer.

00:30:00.950 --> 00:30:01.970 align:middle line:90%
They can be clingy.

00:30:01.970 --> 00:30:03.160 align:middle line:90%
That's one of the downsides.

00:30:03.160 --> 00:30:04.420 align:middle line:90%
Every sign has it downside.

00:30:04.420 --> 00:30:06.184 align:middle line:84%
I'm not picking on
Cancer, because I

00:30:06.184 --> 00:30:07.600 align:middle line:84%
know Cancer can
be very sensitive,

00:30:07.600 --> 00:30:09.420 align:middle line:84%
so please don't take
this personally.

00:30:09.420 --> 00:30:11.160 align:middle line:90%
They can be a little bit moody.

00:30:11.160 --> 00:30:13.000 align:middle line:84%
Again, it's a water
sign connected

00:30:13.000 --> 00:30:14.920 align:middle line:84%
to the cycles of
the moon, the tides.

00:30:14.920 --> 00:30:15.780 align:middle line:90%
The tide's in.

00:30:15.780 --> 00:30:16.500 align:middle line:90%
The tide's out.

00:30:16.500 --> 00:30:16.810 align:middle line:90%
It's up.

00:30:16.810 --> 00:30:17.310 align:middle line:90%
It's down.

00:30:17.310 --> 00:30:18.530 align:middle line:90%
It's choppy.

00:30:18.530 --> 00:30:19.290 align:middle line:90%
It's placid.

00:30:19.290 --> 00:30:21.690 align:middle line:84%
This is all part of
the Cancer persona.

00:30:21.690 --> 00:30:23.250 align:middle line:84%
They can be a little
self-absorbed,

00:30:23.250 --> 00:30:25.880 align:middle line:84%
because when they get into
their emotional space,

00:30:25.880 --> 00:30:27.860 align:middle line:90%
they tend to shut the world out.

00:30:27.860 --> 00:30:30.370 align:middle line:84%
And their emotions
and their experience

00:30:30.370 --> 00:30:32.930 align:middle line:84%
and what they're going through
becomes the most important

00:30:32.930 --> 00:30:34.720 align:middle line:84%
thing to them at
that point in time.

00:30:34.720 --> 00:30:35.790 align:middle line:90%
They can be bitter.

00:30:35.790 --> 00:30:38.470 align:middle line:84%
They don't necessarily--
for instance,

00:30:38.470 --> 00:30:40.750 align:middle line:84%
an Aries, if something
goes wrong with an Aries

00:30:40.750 --> 00:30:43.730 align:middle line:84%
or something doesn't go well
in terms of their projects

00:30:43.730 --> 00:30:46.640 align:middle line:84%
or maybe a job or some
direction in their life,

00:30:46.640 --> 00:30:49.174 align:middle line:84%
an Aries generally
won't tend to be bitter.

00:30:49.174 --> 00:30:51.090 align:middle line:84%
They will get angry and
then they will set out

00:30:51.090 --> 00:30:54.410 align:middle line:84%
again to try to move
forward and to try

00:30:54.410 --> 00:30:56.830 align:middle line:84%
to get over the next
hurdle or the next hump.

00:30:56.830 --> 00:30:59.725 align:middle line:84%
Cancers won't
necessarily do that.

00:30:59.725 --> 00:31:03.428 align:middle line:84%
Even though it's
a cardinal sign,

00:31:03.428 --> 00:31:07.420 align:middle line:84%
the whole direction, the whole
concept of the Cancer mobility

00:31:07.420 --> 00:31:11.247 align:middle line:84%
and motility is symbolic of the
animal and the creature itself.

00:31:11.247 --> 00:31:11.955 align:middle line:90%
It move sideways.

00:31:11.955 --> 00:31:13.330 align:middle line:90%
It moves backwards.

00:31:13.330 --> 00:31:14.900 align:middle line:90%
It doesn't always move forward.

00:31:14.900 --> 00:31:17.430 align:middle line:84%
And quite often, it
moves in retreat form.

00:31:17.430 --> 00:31:22.570 align:middle line:84%
So bitterness can be an
expression or manifestation

00:31:22.570 --> 00:31:25.480 align:middle line:84%
of the Cancer
individual deciding

00:31:25.480 --> 00:31:27.890 align:middle line:90%
that they have to regroup.

00:31:27.890 --> 00:31:30.600 align:middle line:84%
And they can use the
bitterness at times

00:31:30.600 --> 00:31:34.650 align:middle line:84%
as kind of an instrument
or tool to heal

00:31:34.650 --> 00:31:36.040 align:middle line:90%
if they can overcome it.

00:31:36.040 --> 00:31:38.150 align:middle line:84%
If they can transform
that bitterness,

00:31:38.150 --> 00:31:40.580 align:middle line:84%
if they can use that
energy, then they

00:31:40.580 --> 00:31:41.980 align:middle line:90%
can begin to move forward again.

00:31:41.980 --> 00:31:45.750 align:middle line:84%
But the problem is that they can
get caught and stuck at times,

00:31:45.750 --> 00:31:48.350 align:middle line:84%
and they can hold on to
things for quite a while.

00:31:48.350 --> 00:31:50.690 align:middle line:84%
Oversensitivity
is another aspect,

00:31:50.690 --> 00:31:52.800 align:middle line:84%
a negative aspect
of being a Cancer.

00:31:52.800 --> 00:31:55.450 align:middle line:84%
Quite often, Cancers
are unfortunately

00:31:55.450 --> 00:31:59.990 align:middle line:84%
labeled as the
cheapskates of the zodiac.

00:31:59.990 --> 00:32:02.120 align:middle line:84%
They tend to hold
onto their money

00:32:02.120 --> 00:32:06.400 align:middle line:84%
because they're always thinking
about how they can use money

00:32:06.400 --> 00:32:12.020 align:middle line:84%
for something that they can
use at home, a new purchase.

00:32:12.020 --> 00:32:13.650 align:middle line:84%
They like to save
for a rainy day.

00:32:13.650 --> 00:32:15.860 align:middle line:84%
I'm not saying that
Cancers are cheap.

00:32:15.860 --> 00:32:18.810 align:middle line:84%
But they have a very
different concept of money,

00:32:18.810 --> 00:32:21.560 align:middle line:84%
and it's all about bringing
it in and having it

00:32:21.560 --> 00:32:25.694 align:middle line:84%
around so they can use it for
other projects or some day

00:32:25.694 --> 00:32:27.610 align:middle line:84%
in the future where they
really might need it.

00:32:27.610 --> 00:32:31.290 align:middle line:84%
So sometimes, they tend to
not spend a lot of money

00:32:31.290 --> 00:32:34.610 align:middle line:84%
and they will go
to thrift stores

00:32:34.610 --> 00:32:37.160 align:middle line:84%
or they'll buy second
hand cars, because it just

00:32:37.160 --> 00:32:40.110 align:middle line:84%
makes more financial
sense to them.

00:32:40.110 --> 00:32:41.430 align:middle line:90%
They can be frustrated.

00:32:41.430 --> 00:32:44.230 align:middle line:84%
There's a passive aggressive
quality on the negative tip

00:32:44.230 --> 00:32:45.470 align:middle line:90%
that a Cancer has.

00:32:45.470 --> 00:32:47.702 align:middle line:84%
They can be churlish
and dependent--

00:32:47.702 --> 00:32:49.160 align:middle line:84%
a little bit on
the dependent side.

00:32:49.160 --> 00:32:49.680 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:32:49.680 --> 00:32:51.890 align:middle line:84%
So let's get into some
of the cultural ciphers.

00:32:51.890 --> 00:32:55.560 align:middle line:84%
Now, Madonna's actually
a Leo, but I chose her

00:32:55.560 --> 00:32:58.300 align:middle line:84%
because she-- of course,
the name Madonna.

00:32:58.300 --> 00:33:03.680 align:middle line:84%
But she also has, at times,
this manifestation as Isis.

00:33:03.680 --> 00:33:07.330 align:middle line:84%
If you saw the Super Bowl
two years ago in Indianapolis

00:33:07.330 --> 00:33:11.421 align:middle line:84%
at Lucas Field, she absolutely
was the personification

00:33:11.421 --> 00:33:11.920 align:middle line:90%
of Isis.

00:33:11.920 --> 00:33:13.600 align:middle line:84%
And I think I
actually included Isis

00:33:13.600 --> 00:33:15.320 align:middle line:90%
in here at one point in time.

00:33:15.320 --> 00:33:20.670 align:middle line:84%
So Madonna, the mother--
she is a symbol of Cancer.

00:33:20.670 --> 00:33:24.030 align:middle line:84%
Baseball-- very American sport,
connected to this country.

00:33:24.030 --> 00:33:25.660 align:middle line:90%
It's another symbol of Cancer.

00:33:25.660 --> 00:33:27.660 align:middle line:84%
I put board Bourdain in
here-- Anthony Bourdain,

00:33:27.660 --> 00:33:28.550 align:middle line:90%
who's a Cancer.

00:33:28.550 --> 00:33:30.000 align:middle line:90%
He's got Mercury in Gemini.

00:33:30.000 --> 00:33:33.120 align:middle line:84%
But you can tell if you've ever
watched Anthony Bourdain on TV,

00:33:33.120 --> 00:33:35.630 align:middle line:90%
he's got that churlishness.

00:33:35.630 --> 00:33:38.560 align:middle line:90%
He's sort of cynical at times.

00:33:38.560 --> 00:33:41.780 align:middle line:90%
But he's also really into food.

00:33:41.780 --> 00:33:42.870 align:middle line:90%
That's his calling card.

00:33:42.870 --> 00:33:43.786 align:middle line:90%
And Cancers love food.

00:33:43.786 --> 00:33:45.350 align:middle line:90%
They love to prepare food.

00:33:45.350 --> 00:33:46.370 align:middle line:90%
They like to eat food.

00:33:46.370 --> 00:33:49.180 align:middle line:84%
So Bourdain is another
cultural cipher of Cancer.

00:33:49.180 --> 00:33:51.740 align:middle line:84%
Food courts-- very
Cancerian kind

00:33:51.740 --> 00:33:54.440 align:middle line:90%
of institution in our lives.

00:33:54.440 --> 00:33:58.400 align:middle line:84%
Freedom fries-- I put
freedom fries in there.

00:33:58.400 --> 00:33:59.990 align:middle line:90%
We don't eat freedom fries.

00:33:59.990 --> 00:34:01.280 align:middle line:90%
We eat French fries.

00:34:01.280 --> 00:34:03.780 align:middle line:84%
But for that brief
period of time

00:34:03.780 --> 00:34:08.429 align:middle line:84%
after 9/11, the French fry
was renamed the freedom fry,

00:34:08.429 --> 00:34:12.550 align:middle line:84%
and it was a very Cancerian
kind of meme in some ways

00:34:12.550 --> 00:34:15.159 align:middle line:84%
because it was bringing
it back to America

00:34:15.159 --> 00:34:17.900 align:middle line:84%
and taking it away from the
French, who were not helping us

00:34:17.900 --> 00:34:20.776 align:middle line:90%
in the Middle East and in Iraq.

00:34:20.776 --> 00:34:22.150 align:middle line:84%
But freedom fries
was shortlived.

00:34:22.150 --> 00:34:23.889 align:middle line:84%
French fries taste
better anyway.

00:34:23.889 --> 00:34:27.011 align:middle line:84%
Home Depot-- that's another
cultural manifestation

00:34:27.011 --> 00:34:27.510 align:middle line:90%
of Cancer.

00:34:27.510 --> 00:34:29.051 align:middle line:84%
It's where you go
and buy your tools.

00:34:29.051 --> 00:34:30.850 align:middle line:90%
It's very popular.

00:34:30.850 --> 00:34:33.719 align:middle line:84%
The redneck comics-- if
you've see those guys on TV,

00:34:33.719 --> 00:34:36.247 align:middle line:84%
they're very Cancerian
in a lot of ways.

00:34:36.247 --> 00:34:37.330 align:middle line:90%
What else do we have here?

00:34:37.330 --> 00:34:40.260 align:middle line:84%
Dorothy, Judy Garland--
Judy Garland was a Cancer.

00:34:40.260 --> 00:34:43.285 align:middle line:84%
And her manifestation
and personification

00:34:43.285 --> 00:34:47.130 align:middle line:84%
as Dorothy in The Wizard
of Oz is very Cancerian.

00:34:47.130 --> 00:34:48.179 align:middle line:90%
Here she is.

00:34:48.179 --> 00:34:49.560 align:middle line:90%
She's this young girl.

00:34:49.560 --> 00:34:51.110 align:middle line:84%
All she wants to
do is go find home.

00:34:51.110 --> 00:34:54.179 align:middle line:84%
She wants to return home, which
is a very Cancerian aspect.

00:34:54.179 --> 00:34:57.030 align:middle line:84%
So she's cast out of
the heartland, which

00:34:57.030 --> 00:34:59.200 align:middle line:84%
is the center of the United
States, Kansas, which

00:34:59.200 --> 00:35:02.380 align:middle line:84%
is, again, very Cancerian,
and she has to find her way

00:35:02.380 --> 00:35:04.320 align:middle line:84%
and wind her way
back to that place.

00:35:04.320 --> 00:35:06.060 align:middle line:90%
So she is a cultural cipher.

00:35:06.060 --> 00:35:09.230 align:middle line:84%
Station wagons-- of course, the
station wagon, very Cancerian.

00:35:09.230 --> 00:35:11.730 align:middle line:84%
It's the home on your
back-- campers, as well.

00:35:11.730 --> 00:35:14.319 align:middle line:84%
Estate sales-- a very
Cancerian kind of thing

00:35:14.319 --> 00:35:15.360 align:middle line:90%
that goes on quite a bit.

00:35:15.360 --> 00:35:17.443 align:middle line:84%
And the New Deal and the
Hoover Dam-- the New Deal

00:35:17.443 --> 00:35:19.850 align:middle line:84%
to place when Uranus
was in Cancer.

00:35:19.850 --> 00:35:22.500 align:middle line:84%
So there was a lot of
activity taking place

00:35:22.500 --> 00:35:26.450 align:middle line:84%
around the country with
the Hoover Dam and freeways

00:35:26.450 --> 00:35:30.640 align:middle line:84%
and hydroelectric power
plants besides the Hoover Dam.

00:35:30.640 --> 00:35:36.850 align:middle line:84%
It was the massive
infrastructure expansion

00:35:36.850 --> 00:35:37.890 align:middle line:90%
in the United States.

00:35:37.890 --> 00:35:41.660 align:middle line:84%
So that's all part of the
culture ciphers for Cancer.

00:35:41.660 --> 00:35:42.540 align:middle line:90%
Here we go.

00:35:42.540 --> 00:35:45.190 align:middle line:84%
The highest octave-- "To
nurture the soul like a child."

00:35:45.190 --> 00:35:48.130 align:middle line:84%
So if you're Cancer, nurture
your soul like it's a child.

00:35:48.130 --> 00:35:50.140 align:middle line:84%
Take care of it and
make sure it gets

00:35:50.140 --> 00:35:54.390 align:middle line:84%
what it needs-- sleep,
rest, food, fluids, fun.

00:35:54.390 --> 00:35:57.930 align:middle line:84%
Whatever it is, take care of
that soul like it's your own.

00:35:57.930 --> 00:35:58.560 align:middle line:90%
All right.

00:35:58.560 --> 00:35:59.060 align:middle line:90%
Here we go.

00:35:59.060 --> 00:36:00.410 align:middle line:90%
Let's move on to Leo.

00:36:00.410 --> 00:36:06.460 align:middle line:84%
So Leo-- the dates for Leo
are July 23 to August 22.

00:36:06.460 --> 00:36:09.410 align:middle line:84%
The element of Leo
is, of course, fire.

00:36:09.410 --> 00:36:11.830 align:middle line:84%
The ruling planet
of Leo is the sun.

00:36:11.830 --> 00:36:13.770 align:middle line:90%
And the energy for Leo is fixed.

00:36:13.770 --> 00:36:15.480 align:middle line:90%
Here we have another fixed sign.

00:36:15.480 --> 00:36:19.100 align:middle line:84%
Leos like Tauruses,
Scorpio, and Aquarius,

00:36:19.100 --> 00:36:20.490 align:middle line:90%
can be quite stubborn.

00:36:20.490 --> 00:36:22.440 align:middle line:84%
The keywords and
strengths for Leo

00:36:22.440 --> 00:36:31.090 align:middle line:84%
are confident, ambitious, loyal,
generous, encouraging, loving,

00:36:31.090 --> 00:36:32.740 align:middle line:90%
and creative.

00:36:32.740 --> 00:36:34.760 align:middle line:84%
These are all aspects
and they're all

00:36:34.760 --> 00:36:37.460 align:middle line:84%
energies that, really,
I think, typify what

00:36:37.460 --> 00:36:39.410 align:middle line:90%
the sign Leo is all about.

00:36:39.410 --> 00:36:41.430 align:middle line:84%
Leos are really fun
to hang out with.

00:36:41.430 --> 00:36:45.140 align:middle line:84%
If you have Leo friends, they're
great to go to parties with.

00:36:45.140 --> 00:36:48.720 align:middle line:84%
If you go to their house and
have a party at their house,

00:36:48.720 --> 00:36:51.400 align:middle line:84%
it's usually very
comfortable, nicely appointed,

00:36:51.400 --> 00:36:52.210 align:middle line:90%
good things to eat.

00:36:52.210 --> 00:36:54.120 align:middle line:84%
The only thing you
have to do is you

00:36:54.120 --> 00:36:57.040 align:middle line:84%
have to roll with
them as the center

00:36:57.040 --> 00:36:59.030 align:middle line:90%
of the attention at the party.

00:36:59.030 --> 00:37:00.070 align:middle line:90%
And that's OK.

00:37:00.070 --> 00:37:04.280 align:middle line:84%
All Leos are looking for are
some love and some recognition

00:37:04.280 --> 00:37:05.210 align:middle line:90%
and some respect.

00:37:05.210 --> 00:37:08.420 align:middle line:84%
You do that with your Leo friend
or your wife or your husband

00:37:08.420 --> 00:37:11.120 align:middle line:84%
or your mate or your partner
and they will give you the shirt

00:37:11.120 --> 00:37:12.240 align:middle line:90%
off their back.

00:37:12.240 --> 00:37:16.686 align:middle line:84%
Just tell them they're great
every now and then and mean it

00:37:16.686 --> 00:37:18.310 align:middle line:84%
and they will open
their hearts to you.

00:37:18.310 --> 00:37:20.460 align:middle line:84%
They love to wear their
hearts on their sleeves.

00:37:20.460 --> 00:37:23.330 align:middle line:84%
And generally, by and large,
Leos are very honest people.

00:37:23.330 --> 00:37:24.470 align:middle line:90%
They hate dishonesty.

00:37:24.470 --> 00:37:26.890 align:middle line:84%
They don't like
people lying to them.

00:37:26.890 --> 00:37:30.140 align:middle line:84%
And if somebody does lie to
a Leo, they feel betrayed.

00:37:30.140 --> 00:37:32.840 align:middle line:84%
That gets into this whole
betraying the king or betraying

00:37:32.840 --> 00:37:35.860 align:middle line:84%
the queen, which is an aspect
of the Leo with royalty.

00:37:35.860 --> 00:37:37.660 align:middle line:84%
Some of their
weaknesses-- they can

00:37:37.660 --> 00:37:40.120 align:middle line:84%
be a little
pretentious at times.

00:37:40.120 --> 00:37:41.750 align:middle line:84%
They can certainly
be domineering.

00:37:41.750 --> 00:37:43.600 align:middle line:90%
They can eat up space.

00:37:43.600 --> 00:37:47.980 align:middle line:84%
Again, the planet that
represents Leo is the sun.

00:37:47.980 --> 00:37:49.040 align:middle line:90%
And what does the sun do?

00:37:49.040 --> 00:37:50.369 align:middle line:90%
The sun consumes-- it's heat.

00:37:50.369 --> 00:37:51.160 align:middle line:90%
It consumes oxygen.

00:37:51.160 --> 00:37:52.390 align:middle line:90%
Heat consumes oxygen.

00:37:52.390 --> 00:37:53.810 align:middle line:90%
So they can eat up space.

00:37:53.810 --> 00:37:54.980 align:middle line:90%
They could be vain.

00:37:54.980 --> 00:37:58.480 align:middle line:84%
Again, sometimes, a Leo-- you
can tell them they're great

00:37:58.480 --> 00:38:01.130 align:middle line:84%
a couple times a day,
two or three times a day,

00:38:01.130 --> 00:38:02.370 align:middle line:90%
five, six times a week.

00:38:02.370 --> 00:38:04.500 align:middle line:84%
And sometimes, it might
not necessarily be enough

00:38:04.500 --> 00:38:08.980 align:middle line:84%
because ultimately, even
though they appear to be very

00:38:08.980 --> 00:38:12.640 align:middle line:84%
confident and they appear to
be really OK in their own skin,

00:38:12.640 --> 00:38:14.370 align:middle line:90%
a lot of Leos aren't.

00:38:14.370 --> 00:38:17.190 align:middle line:84%
A lot of Leos can
be very insecure.

00:38:17.190 --> 00:38:21.200 align:middle line:84%
And as a result, they will
turn on the confidence switch

00:38:21.200 --> 00:38:24.570 align:middle line:84%
to overcompensate and overcome
a sense of insecurity.

00:38:24.570 --> 00:38:27.400 align:middle line:84%
So vanity is a
manifestation of that.

00:38:27.400 --> 00:38:30.460 align:middle line:84%
They can be melodramatic
because they're a fixed sign.

00:38:30.460 --> 00:38:31.370 align:middle line:90%
They can be stubborn.

00:38:31.370 --> 00:38:33.960 align:middle line:84%
If you've had a
Leo parent, you'll

00:38:33.960 --> 00:38:37.310 align:middle line:84%
know that, especially
if you had Leo father.

00:38:37.310 --> 00:38:40.080 align:middle line:84%
There are limits to the
times you can come home.

00:38:40.080 --> 00:38:41.740 align:middle line:84%
There are limits as
to what you can do,

00:38:41.740 --> 00:38:43.380 align:middle line:90%
who you can hang out with.

00:38:43.380 --> 00:38:45.370 align:middle line:84%
So they can be
extremely stubborn.

00:38:45.370 --> 00:38:48.580 align:middle line:84%
Yes, they can be egotistical,
because they have, sometimes,

00:38:48.580 --> 00:38:50.510 align:middle line:84%
a really grand sense
of who they are.

00:38:50.510 --> 00:38:52.500 align:middle line:90%
And they can be petty as well.

00:38:52.500 --> 00:38:55.124 align:middle line:84%
So if you cross a Leo,
you have to watch out,

00:38:55.124 --> 00:38:56.790 align:middle line:84%
because it's like
you're crossing a king

00:38:56.790 --> 00:38:58.180 align:middle line:90%
or crossing a queen.

00:38:58.180 --> 00:39:02.400 align:middle line:84%
And they may not
always have a type

00:39:02.400 --> 00:39:04.470 align:middle line:84%
of discernment or
detachment that

00:39:04.470 --> 00:39:08.150 align:middle line:84%
allows them to step
back and be objective.

00:39:08.150 --> 00:39:09.650 align:middle line:84%
And they can be
petty as a result.

00:39:09.650 --> 00:39:13.290 align:middle line:84%
So some of the cultural ciphers
that are associated with Leo

00:39:13.290 --> 00:39:15.800 align:middle line:84%
are the Cowardly Lion--
staying with the Wizard

00:39:15.800 --> 00:39:17.850 align:middle line:90%
of Oz theme, the Cowardly Lion.

00:39:17.850 --> 00:39:20.030 align:middle line:84%
Roy Hobbs-- and I
picked Rob Hobbs

00:39:20.030 --> 00:39:22.970 align:middle line:84%
because Robert Redford
happens to be a Leo,

00:39:22.970 --> 00:39:25.380 align:middle line:84%
and his Leo nature
really shines through

00:39:25.380 --> 00:39:28.000 align:middle line:84%
in that character in
the film "The Natural."

00:39:28.000 --> 00:39:31.390 align:middle line:84%
So Roy Hobbs-- a
manifestation of Leo.

00:39:31.390 --> 00:39:33.210 align:middle line:90%
Bill Clinton is a Leo.

00:39:33.210 --> 00:39:34.770 align:middle line:90%
Of course he's a Leo.

00:39:34.770 --> 00:39:37.140 align:middle line:84%
And Barack Obama--
he's a Leo as well.

00:39:37.140 --> 00:39:40.730 align:middle line:84%
But Clinton, in some ways,
typifies Leo even more

00:39:40.730 --> 00:39:41.747 align:middle line:90%
than Obama does.

00:39:41.747 --> 00:39:43.330 align:middle line:84%
And I think it has
to do with the fact

00:39:43.330 --> 00:39:45.775 align:middle line:84%
that-- well, maybe,
he plays saxophone.

00:39:45.775 --> 00:39:47.400 align:middle line:84%
Maybe that has
something to do with it.

00:39:47.400 --> 00:39:49.550 align:middle line:90%
But Bill Clinton-- obvious Leo.

00:39:49.550 --> 00:39:53.110 align:middle line:84%
Mick Jagger--
another Leo as well.

00:39:53.110 --> 00:39:57.470 align:middle line:84%
The Sphinx-- there is a
cultural cipher for Leo.

00:39:57.470 --> 00:39:59.630 align:middle line:84%
Bob Marley-- now, Bob
Marley was an Aquarius.

00:39:59.630 --> 00:40:02.350 align:middle line:84%
But I put him in
here because there

00:40:02.350 --> 00:40:06.890 align:middle line:84%
was a very lionesque or
Leonine quality to Marley

00:40:06.890 --> 00:40:08.930 align:middle line:90%
and his persona and his energy.

00:40:08.930 --> 00:40:11.150 align:middle line:90%
He was really into truth.

00:40:11.150 --> 00:40:14.690 align:middle line:84%
And he sang about the lion of
Judah in a lot of the songs.

00:40:14.690 --> 00:40:19.430 align:middle line:84%
So to me, even though Marley was
an Aquarius, he felt very Leo

00:40:19.430 --> 00:40:22.790 align:middle line:84%
or he feels like a
symbol of Leo for me.

00:40:22.790 --> 00:40:28.050 align:middle line:84%
Italy, to me, typifies
a country that

00:40:28.050 --> 00:40:34.200 align:middle line:84%
feels very Leo, that enjoys
good food and, in some ways,

00:40:34.200 --> 00:40:35.970 align:middle line:90%
a sense of entitlement as well.

00:40:35.970 --> 00:40:40.490 align:middle line:84%
The heart chakra is a symbol of
Leo, cultural cipher for Leo.

00:40:40.490 --> 00:40:43.390 align:middle line:84%
The puer aeternus-- this
is the eternal youth.

00:40:43.390 --> 00:40:46.870 align:middle line:84%
This is the Leo doesn't
want to grow up, per se.

00:40:46.870 --> 00:40:48.740 align:middle line:84%
Red wine and chocolate--
these are also

00:40:48.740 --> 00:40:52.530 align:middle line:84%
very kind of royal,
rich redolent symbols

00:40:52.530 --> 00:40:54.770 align:middle line:84%
and cultural ciphers
of the sign Leo.

00:40:54.770 --> 00:40:57.090 align:middle line:84%
The highest octave for
Leo is "The royal soul

00:40:57.090 --> 00:40:58.660 align:middle line:90%
must serve without fail."

00:40:58.660 --> 00:41:01.820 align:middle line:84%
So here, if you're
a Leo, the way

00:41:01.820 --> 00:41:04.260 align:middle line:84%
that you tap into
your power and the way

00:41:04.260 --> 00:41:07.332 align:middle line:84%
that you tap into the
higher octave of being

00:41:07.332 --> 00:41:10.670 align:middle line:84%
a Leo in this lifetime is to
be able to serve other people

00:41:10.670 --> 00:41:14.750 align:middle line:84%
and to not take yourself
out of the whole idea

00:41:14.750 --> 00:41:18.150 align:middle line:84%
that the king or
the queen is only as

00:41:18.150 --> 00:41:23.380 align:middle line:84%
powerful as their relationship
to the lowest, quote

00:41:23.380 --> 00:41:25.680 align:middle line:84%
unquote, person
in their kingdom.

00:41:25.680 --> 00:41:29.050 align:middle line:84%
So if you keep that in mind
and retain your humility

00:41:29.050 --> 00:41:32.180 align:middle line:84%
and retain your ability
to keep your heart open,

00:41:32.180 --> 00:41:33.730 align:middle line:84%
you will always,
always, always be

00:41:33.730 --> 00:41:35.740 align:middle line:84%
able to tap into the
higher octaves of Leo.

00:41:35.740 --> 00:41:36.240 align:middle line:90%
All right.

00:41:36.240 --> 00:41:36.844 align:middle line:90%
So here we go.

00:41:36.844 --> 00:41:38.010 align:middle line:90%
Let's go onto the next sign.

00:41:38.010 --> 00:41:41.440 align:middle line:84%
Of course, it's Virgo--
August 23 to September 22.

00:41:41.440 --> 00:41:42.660 align:middle line:90%
The element is earth.

00:41:42.660 --> 00:41:44.180 align:middle line:90%
The energy is mutable.

00:41:44.180 --> 00:41:48.010 align:middle line:84%
The keyword strengths are
analytical, observant,

00:41:48.010 --> 00:41:50.940 align:middle line:84%
reliable, dependable,
and precise.

00:41:50.940 --> 00:41:52.750 align:middle line:84%
Virgo is a bit of
a strange sign.

00:41:52.750 --> 00:41:56.910 align:middle line:84%
And I happen to be a Virgo, so
I think I know a bit about it.

00:41:56.910 --> 00:41:59.400 align:middle line:84%
I think it's one of the
most least understood

00:41:59.400 --> 00:42:01.230 align:middle line:90%
signs in the zodiac.

00:42:01.230 --> 00:42:02.840 align:middle line:84%
And part of the
reason I think is

00:42:02.840 --> 00:42:06.680 align:middle line:84%
because I don't think we figured
out the planet that really

00:42:06.680 --> 00:42:11.250 align:middle line:84%
represents Virgo, because
the planet Mercury represents

00:42:11.250 --> 00:42:12.375 align:middle line:90%
both Gemini and Virgo.

00:42:12.375 --> 00:42:14.500 align:middle line:84%
When I think of Mercury,
I really think of the sign

00:42:14.500 --> 00:42:17.790 align:middle line:84%
Gemini and Hermes, the
messenger and quicksilver.

00:42:17.790 --> 00:42:20.750 align:middle line:84%
But I don't necessarily
associate the planet Mercury

00:42:20.750 --> 00:42:21.580 align:middle line:90%
with Virgo.

00:42:21.580 --> 00:42:25.130 align:middle line:84%
I think that the plan
for Virgo is Vulcan.

00:42:25.130 --> 00:42:28.250 align:middle line:84%
And we'll get into that
here with Mr. Spock.

00:42:28.250 --> 00:42:30.626 align:middle line:84%
So the reason why I think
Virgos are misunderstood

00:42:30.626 --> 00:42:32.000 align:middle line:84%
is because they
don't really have

00:42:32.000 --> 00:42:34.180 align:middle line:90%
a celestial home in some ways.

00:42:34.180 --> 00:42:36.740 align:middle line:84%
So Virgo-- it's an
interesting sign.

00:42:36.740 --> 00:42:37.930 align:middle line:90%
It's an earth sign.

00:42:37.930 --> 00:42:39.600 align:middle line:84%
But of all the
earth signs, I think

00:42:39.600 --> 00:42:42.690 align:middle line:84%
it's the least grounded, in
some ways, of the earth signs.

00:42:42.690 --> 00:42:44.800 align:middle line:84%
As a result, some
of the weaknesses

00:42:44.800 --> 00:42:48.480 align:middle line:84%
are Virgos can be
extremely skeptical.

00:42:48.480 --> 00:42:50.420 align:middle line:90%
They can be really nervous.

00:42:50.420 --> 00:42:53.530 align:middle line:84%
And they have a really
hard time relaxing.

00:42:53.530 --> 00:42:55.870 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes, they have a
difficult time sleeping.

00:42:55.870 --> 00:42:58.850 align:middle line:84%
And they can appear to be
very calm on the surface.

00:42:58.850 --> 00:43:01.690 align:middle line:84%
But beneath the surface, it
can be a bundle of nerves.

00:43:01.690 --> 00:43:03.710 align:middle line:84%
Certainly, they
can be inflexible,

00:43:03.710 --> 00:43:05.870 align:middle line:84%
even though it is
a mutable sign.

00:43:05.870 --> 00:43:07.989 align:middle line:84%
If a Virgo doesn't
like something,

00:43:07.989 --> 00:43:10.030 align:middle line:84%
they're not going to really
change their mind all

00:43:10.030 --> 00:43:13.260 align:middle line:84%
that much, which is kind of the
irony and the paradox of Virgo,

00:43:13.260 --> 00:43:15.520 align:middle line:84%
especially as it
relates to diet.

00:43:15.520 --> 00:43:16.120 align:middle line:90%
They're fussy.

00:43:16.120 --> 00:43:17.860 align:middle line:90%
Virgos can be very fussy eaters.

00:43:17.860 --> 00:43:19.670 align:middle line:90%
They may not like certain foods.

00:43:19.670 --> 00:43:21.510 align:middle line:84%
And maybe over the
course of a lifetime,

00:43:21.510 --> 00:43:23.700 align:middle line:84%
they may change their
opinion of certain foods,

00:43:23.700 --> 00:43:26.730 align:middle line:84%
but there are some foods
they won't ever embrace.

00:43:26.730 --> 00:43:29.210 align:middle line:84%
They can be cold
and detached, again,

00:43:29.210 --> 00:43:31.080 align:middle line:84%
even though they
are an earth sign.

00:43:31.080 --> 00:43:34.410 align:middle line:84%
They can be interfering
and critical.

00:43:34.410 --> 00:43:36.200 align:middle line:84%
So the positive
side is analytical.

00:43:36.200 --> 00:43:38.890 align:middle line:90%
The negative side is critical.

00:43:38.890 --> 00:43:41.710 align:middle line:84%
They can be interfering
and critical and also

00:43:41.710 --> 00:43:44.520 align:middle line:90%
quite impatient, as well.

00:43:44.520 --> 00:43:46.520 align:middle line:84%
Some of the cultural
ciphers for Virgo

00:43:46.520 --> 00:43:51.530 align:middle line:84%
include Lourdes, where people
go and the experience the waters

00:43:51.530 --> 00:43:52.320 align:middle line:90%
and get healed.

00:43:52.320 --> 00:43:56.920 align:middle line:84%
It's a very Virgoan
experience-- tasting and testing

00:43:56.920 --> 00:43:59.240 align:middle line:84%
and being a part of the
purity of the water.

00:43:59.240 --> 00:44:03.040 align:middle line:84%
Mother Mary-- another very
cultural Virgoan symbol.

00:44:03.040 --> 00:44:06.220 align:middle line:84%
Veganism, I think, is
connected to being a Virgo

00:44:06.220 --> 00:44:08.000 align:middle line:84%
because, with
veganism, people are

00:44:08.000 --> 00:44:11.180 align:middle line:84%
trying to get to the purity
and the essence of food.

00:44:11.180 --> 00:44:13.990 align:middle line:84%
And staying with
a raw diet can be

00:44:13.990 --> 00:44:16.700 align:middle line:84%
a very Virgoan
kind of experience.

00:44:16.700 --> 00:44:19.880 align:middle line:84%
Here's Mr. Spock, the
Vulcan, from Star Trek.

00:44:19.880 --> 00:44:21.220 align:middle line:90%
Extremely Virgo-- why?

00:44:21.220 --> 00:44:23.120 align:middle line:90%
Because he was emotionless.

00:44:23.120 --> 00:44:24.390 align:middle line:90%
He used his mind.

00:44:24.390 --> 00:44:25.390 align:middle line:90%
He used his rationality.

00:44:25.390 --> 00:44:27.320 align:middle line:90%
He used his logic.

00:44:27.320 --> 00:44:31.090 align:middle line:84%
So he's very
Virgoan, which tends

00:44:31.090 --> 00:44:33.750 align:middle line:84%
to get me to believe
that Vulcan-- somewhere

00:44:33.750 --> 00:44:37.080 align:middle line:84%
out there, perhaps on an
alternative orbit of the sun--

00:44:37.080 --> 00:44:39.704 align:middle line:84%
Vulcan is the true home
of the sign of Virgo.

00:44:39.704 --> 00:44:41.120 align:middle line:84%
Now, this was kind
of interesting.

00:44:41.120 --> 00:44:43.120 align:middle line:84%
I decided to put
steroids in here.

00:44:43.120 --> 00:44:47.200 align:middle line:84%
And steroids can also be
associated with Aries.

00:44:47.200 --> 00:44:53.375 align:middle line:84%
But steroids are this really
interesting phenomenon

00:44:53.375 --> 00:44:55.650 align:middle line:84%
in the latter part
of the 20th century.

00:44:55.650 --> 00:44:59.490 align:middle line:84%
And it's not necessarily
about putting an impurity

00:44:59.490 --> 00:45:02.100 align:middle line:84%
into the body, which
Virgo would be averse to.

00:45:02.100 --> 00:45:04.330 align:middle line:84%
But it's about the
perfection of the body

00:45:04.330 --> 00:45:07.960 align:middle line:84%
and using some form
of anabolic enhancer

00:45:07.960 --> 00:45:10.200 align:middle line:90%
in order to bring that about.

00:45:10.200 --> 00:45:12.660 align:middle line:84%
So I thought steroids
were a really interesting

00:45:12.660 --> 00:45:15.200 align:middle line:90%
cultural cipher for Virgo.

00:45:15.200 --> 00:45:17.250 align:middle line:90%
Michael Jackson was a Virgo.

00:45:17.250 --> 00:45:20.460 align:middle line:84%
And I think he fits in
this category as well.

00:45:20.460 --> 00:45:22.940 align:middle line:84%
Mercury-- the
mercury lights, what

00:45:22.940 --> 00:45:25.176 align:middle line:84%
we're now unfortunately
having to use.

00:45:25.176 --> 00:45:26.550 align:middle line:84%
Mercury, of course,
is associated

00:45:26.550 --> 00:45:27.780 align:middle line:90%
with the sign of Virgo.

00:45:27.780 --> 00:45:30.530 align:middle line:84%
And lights are very
functional, very efficient.

00:45:30.530 --> 00:45:31.920 align:middle line:90%
They're part of our lives.

00:45:31.920 --> 00:45:34.020 align:middle line:84%
So mercury lights are
now an aspect of Virgo.

00:45:34.020 --> 00:45:36.200 align:middle line:90%
Celibacy is very Virgoan.

00:45:36.200 --> 00:45:39.610 align:middle line:84%
Zen-- the whole concept
the Zen, very Virgo.

00:45:39.610 --> 00:45:42.870 align:middle line:84%
Environmentalism-- very much
connected to the sign of Virgo.

00:45:42.870 --> 00:45:47.160 align:middle line:84%
Mother Teresa, who was a
Virgo, and also Beyonce--

00:45:47.160 --> 00:45:49.732 align:middle line:84%
I put her in there
because she's a Virgo.

00:45:49.732 --> 00:45:51.190 align:middle line:84%
And if you know
anything about her,

00:45:51.190 --> 00:45:55.040 align:middle line:84%
she is an absolute
fanatic about working out.

00:45:55.040 --> 00:45:59.297 align:middle line:84%
So the highest octave is
"Compassionately accepting

00:45:59.297 --> 00:45:59.880 align:middle line:90%
imperfection."

00:45:59.880 --> 00:46:03.450 align:middle line:84%
If a Virgo can do that, if
they can compassionately

00:46:03.450 --> 00:46:07.390 align:middle line:84%
accept imperfection in
themselves and in others,

00:46:07.390 --> 00:46:10.650 align:middle line:84%
they will just absolutely
just hum along in life.

00:46:10.650 --> 00:46:11.150 align:middle line:90%
Here we go.

00:46:11.150 --> 00:46:13.860 align:middle line:84%
Libra-- we've now
reached the halfway point

00:46:13.860 --> 00:46:16.480 align:middle line:84%
in the zodiac--
September 23, which

00:46:16.480 --> 00:46:19.040 align:middle line:84%
is the autumnal
equinox, to October 22.

00:46:19.040 --> 00:46:20.080 align:middle line:90%
The element is air.

00:46:20.080 --> 00:46:21.440 align:middle line:90%
The energy is cardinal.

00:46:21.440 --> 00:46:25.750 align:middle line:84%
And the keyword strengths are
diplomatic, peaceful, kind,

00:46:25.750 --> 00:46:31.060 align:middle line:84%
gracious, idealistic,
hospitable, synergistic,

00:46:31.060 --> 00:46:33.350 align:middle line:90%
esthetic, and balanced.

00:46:33.350 --> 00:46:36.310 align:middle line:84%
What Libras really try
to do in their lives

00:46:36.310 --> 00:46:42.650 align:middle line:84%
is to bring a sense of
harmony and peace and synergy

00:46:42.650 --> 00:46:44.780 align:middle line:84%
into their own lives and
into the lives of others.

00:46:44.780 --> 00:46:47.230 align:middle line:84%
Now, one of the
misnomers of Libra

00:46:47.230 --> 00:46:49.880 align:middle line:84%
is that people think that Libras
are really balanced people.

00:46:49.880 --> 00:46:51.010 align:middle line:90%
Well, they're not.

00:46:51.010 --> 00:46:54.169 align:middle line:84%
Libras are always,
always trying to get

00:46:54.169 --> 00:46:55.210 align:middle line:90%
to that point of balance.

00:46:55.210 --> 00:46:56.959 align:middle line:84%
And they may get to
one area in their life

00:46:56.959 --> 00:46:59.100 align:middle line:84%
where they really are
almost pitch perfect.

00:46:59.100 --> 00:47:03.290 align:middle line:84%
And all of a sudden, the scales
tend to tilt the other way

00:47:03.290 --> 00:47:05.030 align:middle line:84%
and they have to
redirect their balance.

00:47:05.030 --> 00:47:07.090 align:middle line:84%
And when that
happens, there could

00:47:07.090 --> 00:47:11.080 align:middle line:84%
be some really interesting
things that occur as a result.

00:47:11.080 --> 00:47:13.460 align:middle line:84%
So Libra is always
in the process

00:47:13.460 --> 00:47:15.890 align:middle line:84%
of finding balance or
trying to achieve balance

00:47:15.890 --> 00:47:18.080 align:middle line:84%
or bringing balance
into their lives

00:47:18.080 --> 00:47:19.700 align:middle line:90%
or into the lives of others.

00:47:19.700 --> 00:47:20.839 align:middle line:90%
And they're good at it.

00:47:20.839 --> 00:47:22.130 align:middle line:90%
That's what they're here to do.

00:47:22.130 --> 00:47:24.810 align:middle line:84%
Libras are here to learn about
themselves through the other,

00:47:24.810 --> 00:47:26.140 align:middle line:90%
through another person.

00:47:26.140 --> 00:47:28.900 align:middle line:84%
And if you're in a
relationship with a Libra,

00:47:28.900 --> 00:47:31.450 align:middle line:84%
one of things that
Libras like to do

00:47:31.450 --> 00:47:34.320 align:middle line:84%
is they like to show
you what they like.

00:47:34.320 --> 00:47:37.720 align:middle line:84%
They will like to show
you what kind of foods

00:47:37.720 --> 00:47:38.910 align:middle line:90%
that they enjoy eating.

00:47:38.910 --> 00:47:43.210 align:middle line:84%
They like to show you what kind
of movies they enjoy seeing.

00:47:43.210 --> 00:47:45.930 align:middle line:84%
They'll even enjoy showing
you the type of affection

00:47:45.930 --> 00:47:49.780 align:middle line:84%
or sensuality they want to
experience with their own body.

00:47:49.780 --> 00:47:52.650 align:middle line:84%
So Libras are into
exhibiting or displaying

00:47:52.650 --> 00:47:54.260 align:middle line:90%
and not necessary telling.

00:47:54.260 --> 00:47:57.190 align:middle line:84%
So if you're involved with a
Libra, pay attention to that.

00:47:57.190 --> 00:48:00.230 align:middle line:84%
The weaknesses for
a Libra-- well,

00:48:00.230 --> 00:48:02.830 align:middle line:84%
they can be extremely
superficial at times.

00:48:02.830 --> 00:48:07.510 align:middle line:84%
Unreliable-- they can be vain,
like Leo, to a certain extent.

00:48:07.510 --> 00:48:09.700 align:middle line:90%
They can be indecisive.

00:48:09.700 --> 00:48:11.350 align:middle line:84%
When they hit that
imbalance part,

00:48:11.350 --> 00:48:13.250 align:middle line:84%
they're really
difficult to be around.

00:48:13.250 --> 00:48:18.050 align:middle line:84%
And being indecisive is one of
the hardest aspects of being

00:48:18.050 --> 00:48:20.040 align:middle line:84%
a Libra and being
around a Libra.

00:48:20.040 --> 00:48:21.080 align:middle line:90%
And why is that?

00:48:21.080 --> 00:48:24.090 align:middle line:84%
Because they can
understand, in some ways,

00:48:24.090 --> 00:48:28.580 align:middle line:84%
how their actions are going to
affect themselves and affect

00:48:28.580 --> 00:48:29.360 align:middle line:90%
other people.

00:48:29.360 --> 00:48:30.535 align:middle line:90%
They're almost like Hamlet.

00:48:30.535 --> 00:48:33.890 align:middle line:84%
Hamlet would be
Shakespeare's personification

00:48:33.890 --> 00:48:35.260 align:middle line:90%
of being a Libra.

00:48:35.260 --> 00:48:37.270 align:middle line:84%
The other thing that
Libras do, by the way,

00:48:37.270 --> 00:48:40.050 align:middle line:84%
is they're not necessarily
procrastinators,

00:48:40.050 --> 00:48:43.220 align:middle line:84%
but Libras are really good at
creating things in their heads.

00:48:43.220 --> 00:48:45.600 align:middle line:84%
They can create the perfect
novel or the perfect movie

00:48:45.600 --> 00:48:47.950 align:middle line:84%
or the perfect relationship
or the perfect job.

00:48:47.950 --> 00:48:50.010 align:middle line:84%
Whatever that perfect
thing is, they

00:48:50.010 --> 00:48:51.520 align:middle line:90%
can create it in their head.

00:48:51.520 --> 00:48:53.415 align:middle line:84%
The challenge is that
once they've created it

00:48:53.415 --> 00:48:56.110 align:middle line:84%
in their had, they don't
necessarily carry it out.

00:48:56.110 --> 00:48:58.530 align:middle line:84%
It's already done for
them in some ways.

00:48:58.530 --> 00:49:01.840 align:middle line:84%
So if you know a Libra and
they have really good ideas,

00:49:01.840 --> 00:49:05.510 align:middle line:84%
encourage them to follow
through and put them on paper

00:49:05.510 --> 00:49:07.786 align:middle line:84%
or make them manifest
in the real world.

00:49:07.786 --> 00:49:09.410 align:middle line:84%
They can be a little
indulgent as well.

00:49:09.410 --> 00:49:12.510 align:middle line:84%
So some cultural
ciphers for Libra

00:49:12.510 --> 00:49:14.410 align:middle line:84%
are Venus de Milo-- not
Venus of Willendorf,

00:49:14.410 --> 00:49:18.410 align:middle line:84%
but Venus de Milo--
Brigette Bardot,

00:49:18.410 --> 00:49:22.840 align:middle line:84%
who was kind of a vision
of beauty in the 1950s.

00:49:22.840 --> 00:49:23.510 align:middle line:90%
Let's see.

00:49:23.510 --> 00:49:27.675 align:middle line:84%
The scales of justice
are also very Libran.

00:49:27.675 --> 00:49:32.090 align:middle line:84%
The musician Sting-- another
personification of Libra.

00:49:32.090 --> 00:49:36.210 align:middle line:84%
Napa County, which is very
beautiful, very harmonious,

00:49:36.210 --> 00:49:41.410 align:middle line:84%
where you can go and have your
experience be nicely balanced

00:49:41.410 --> 00:49:44.490 align:middle line:84%
between wine and food and
recreation-- Napa Country,

00:49:44.490 --> 00:49:45.510 align:middle line:90%
extremely Libran.

00:49:45.510 --> 00:49:49.370 align:middle line:84%
Jimmy Carter, the former
president, is also a Libra.

00:49:49.370 --> 00:49:52.390 align:middle line:84%
The highest octave for Libra
is "Hitting the sweet spot

00:49:52.390 --> 00:49:55.220 align:middle line:84%
between the will and
receptivity"-- that balance

00:49:55.220 --> 00:49:55.720 align:middle line:90%
point.

00:49:55.720 --> 00:49:56.220 align:middle line:90%
All right.

00:49:56.220 --> 00:49:58.550 align:middle line:84%
Here we go, into the
transpersonal realm-- Scorpio,

00:49:58.550 --> 00:50:01.160 align:middle line:84%
October 22, November 21,
the element is water.

00:50:01.160 --> 00:50:02.560 align:middle line:90%
The energy is fixed.

00:50:02.560 --> 00:50:06.810 align:middle line:84%
The keyword strengths are
loyal, resourceful, dynamic,

00:50:06.810 --> 00:50:10.230 align:middle line:84%
passionate, observant,
wise, regenerative.

00:50:10.230 --> 00:50:12.800 align:middle line:84%
These are all
aspects and energies

00:50:12.800 --> 00:50:15.530 align:middle line:84%
that we associate with
the sign of Scorpio.

00:50:15.530 --> 00:50:19.350 align:middle line:84%
Now, some of the weaknesses
or shadow areas of Scorpio

00:50:19.350 --> 00:50:21.450 align:middle line:84%
are Scorpios can
be really jealous.

00:50:21.450 --> 00:50:23.790 align:middle line:84%
Of all the signs, they
can be the most jealous.

00:50:23.790 --> 00:50:25.581 align:middle line:84%
And sometimes, a person
doesn't necessarily

00:50:25.581 --> 00:50:26.600 align:middle line:90%
have to be a Scorpio.

00:50:26.600 --> 00:50:28.142 align:middle line:90%
They could have moon in Scorpio.

00:50:28.142 --> 00:50:29.350 align:middle line:90%
They could be Scorpio rising.

00:50:29.350 --> 00:50:30.915 align:middle line:84%
They could have
Venus in Scorpio.

00:50:30.915 --> 00:50:32.290 align:middle line:84%
Not necessarily
Mars in Scorpio--

00:50:32.290 --> 00:50:34.890 align:middle line:84%
but those three aspects,
other than the sun,

00:50:34.890 --> 00:50:38.270 align:middle line:84%
can lend itself towards a
jealous type of personality.

00:50:38.270 --> 00:50:41.780 align:middle line:84%
And the reason why Scorpios
tend to be so jealous

00:50:41.780 --> 00:50:43.980 align:middle line:84%
is that they feel
really intensely.

00:50:43.980 --> 00:50:44.890 align:middle line:90%
They feel deeply.

00:50:44.890 --> 00:50:48.070 align:middle line:84%
So whether it's passion,
whether it's connectivity,

00:50:48.070 --> 00:50:50.740 align:middle line:84%
whether it's the
fullness of an embrace

00:50:50.740 --> 00:50:52.567 align:middle line:84%
or connection with
another person,

00:50:52.567 --> 00:50:54.150 align:middle line:84%
they don't really
want to let that go.

00:50:54.150 --> 00:50:55.691 align:middle line:84%
They really don't
want to share that,

00:50:55.691 --> 00:50:57.960 align:middle line:84%
because they're taking it
at a very, very deep level.

00:50:57.960 --> 00:50:59.420 align:middle line:90%
So they can tend to be jealous.

00:50:59.420 --> 00:51:02.380 align:middle line:84%
They can be obsessive,
certainly secretive.

00:51:02.380 --> 00:51:05.080 align:middle line:84%
You don't always know
what a Scorpio's thinking.

00:51:05.080 --> 00:51:07.420 align:middle line:84%
They can be a little on the
suspicious side and always

00:51:07.420 --> 00:51:10.060 align:middle line:84%
trying to figure
out what's going on,

00:51:10.060 --> 00:51:13.460 align:middle line:84%
who's got the power in
any given situation.

00:51:13.460 --> 00:51:14.970 align:middle line:90%
They can be unyielding.

00:51:14.970 --> 00:51:18.150 align:middle line:84%
They can be very difficult to
be around, especially, at times,

00:51:18.150 --> 00:51:19.290 align:middle line:90%
in a relationship.

00:51:19.290 --> 00:51:21.430 align:middle line:84%
It's either their
way or the highway.

00:51:21.430 --> 00:51:23.900 align:middle line:84%
They could be manipulative
and also a little bit

00:51:23.900 --> 00:51:25.550 align:middle line:90%
on the self-destructive side.

00:51:25.550 --> 00:51:28.470 align:middle line:84%
And that's how they work out
their anger, their frustration,

00:51:28.470 --> 00:51:30.230 align:middle line:84%
their resentment,
their bitterness.

00:51:30.230 --> 00:51:33.370 align:middle line:90%
They can take out on themselves.

00:51:33.370 --> 00:51:36.820 align:middle line:84%
Some of the cultural ciphers
that are connected with Scorpio

00:51:36.820 --> 00:51:41.200 align:middle line:84%
are hypnotism and the whole
concept and notion of exorcists

00:51:41.200 --> 00:51:45.270 align:middle line:84%
and dealing with demons,
disincarnate beings-- very

00:51:45.270 --> 00:51:46.380 align:middle line:90%
Scorpionic.

00:51:46.380 --> 00:51:49.210 align:middle line:84%
Ayahuasca is a very
Scorpionic kind

00:51:49.210 --> 00:51:52.430 align:middle line:84%
of experience-- going down
into the jungles of Amazon

00:51:52.430 --> 00:51:56.680 align:middle line:84%
or Colombia or Peru
and drinking the vine.

00:51:56.680 --> 00:51:59.080 align:middle line:84%
Terrace McKenna--
he was a Scorpio.

00:51:59.080 --> 00:52:00.590 align:middle line:90%
And what did he do?

00:52:00.590 --> 00:52:03.940 align:middle line:84%
He got into ayahuasca
and DMT and mushrooms

00:52:03.940 --> 00:52:05.500 align:middle line:90%
in a very intense way.

00:52:05.500 --> 00:52:08.020 align:middle line:84%
He was the guy that
coined the phrase

00:52:08.020 --> 00:52:10.150 align:middle line:90%
"a heroic dose of mushrooms."

00:52:10.150 --> 00:52:11.077 align:middle line:90%
He's a Scorpio.

00:52:11.077 --> 00:52:12.660 align:middle line:84%
Sherlock Holmes-- I
threw him in there

00:52:12.660 --> 00:52:17.170 align:middle line:84%
because he represents
a figure who

00:52:17.170 --> 00:52:20.780 align:middle line:84%
understands mystery
and untangles knots

00:52:20.780 --> 00:52:23.920 align:middle line:84%
and puts pieces of the puzzle
together, a Scorpionic figure.

00:52:23.920 --> 00:52:28.330 align:middle line:84%
He also, I think, later on in
one of the post-Holmes novels,

00:52:28.330 --> 00:52:30.510 align:middle line:90%
goes through addiction as well.

00:52:30.510 --> 00:52:33.500 align:middle line:84%
Goth music and Goth
culture-- very Scorpionic.

00:52:33.500 --> 00:52:36.000 align:middle line:84%
Magma coming out from
the inside of the Earth

00:52:36.000 --> 00:52:37.850 align:middle line:90%
is very Scorpionic.

00:52:37.850 --> 00:52:41.110 align:middle line:84%
The movie "Twilight"
and the TV series

00:52:41.110 --> 00:52:43.410 align:middle line:84%
and the book "True
Blood" are both very

00:52:43.410 --> 00:52:45.710 align:middle line:90%
Scorpionic expressions in media.

00:52:45.710 --> 00:52:49.060 align:middle line:84%
Death metal is another kind
of very Scorpionic phenomenon

00:52:49.060 --> 00:52:49.880 align:middle line:90%
in our time.

00:52:49.880 --> 00:52:53.210 align:middle line:84%
Magnetism, and of course,
the phoenix, the bird,

00:52:53.210 --> 00:52:55.870 align:middle line:84%
is a Scorpionic
symbol and figure.

00:52:55.870 --> 00:52:58.640 align:middle line:84%
The highest octave here
is "Surrender to the fire

00:52:58.640 --> 00:52:59.150 align:middle line:90%
with peace."

00:52:59.150 --> 00:53:02.180 align:middle line:84%
So Scorpios like very
intense situations.

00:53:02.180 --> 00:53:05.010 align:middle line:84%
They like to be confronted
with intense elements.

00:53:05.010 --> 00:53:08.300 align:middle line:84%
In fact, just this last
week, Colin Kaepernick

00:53:08.300 --> 00:53:11.540 align:middle line:84%
was playing against
the Green Bay Packers.

00:53:11.540 --> 00:53:12.940 align:middle line:90%
And it was about five degrees.

00:53:12.940 --> 00:53:15.710 align:middle line:84%
And he didn't wear any
sleeves on his shirt.

00:53:15.710 --> 00:53:18.030 align:middle line:84%
And at the end of game,
Aaron Andrews asked him,

00:53:18.030 --> 00:53:18.710 align:middle line:90%
are you cold?

00:53:18.710 --> 00:53:20.540 align:middle line:84%
He says, no, it's
not cold out there.

00:53:20.540 --> 00:53:23.560 align:middle line:84%
It's a very Scorpio kind
of way of interacting

00:53:23.560 --> 00:53:27.970 align:middle line:84%
with the elements that being
very engaging and intense

00:53:27.970 --> 00:53:29.660 align:middle line:90%
with extreme conditions.

00:53:29.660 --> 00:53:31.180 align:middle line:90%
Let's move onto Sagittarius.

00:53:31.180 --> 00:53:34.100 align:middle line:84%
Here we go-- November
22 to December 21.

00:53:34.100 --> 00:53:35.090 align:middle line:90%
The element is fire.

00:53:35.090 --> 00:53:36.270 align:middle line:90%
The energy is mutable.

00:53:36.270 --> 00:53:39.990 align:middle line:84%
It's connected to the same
family as Gemini and Virgo

00:53:39.990 --> 00:53:41.460 align:middle line:90%
and Pisces.

00:53:41.460 --> 00:53:44.490 align:middle line:84%
The key words and the
strengths for Sagittarius

00:53:44.490 --> 00:53:51.870 align:middle line:84%
are visionary and natural and
open and expansive and humorous

00:53:51.870 --> 00:53:54.870 align:middle line:84%
and athletic and
profound and wise.

00:53:54.870 --> 00:53:57.750 align:middle line:84%
If you think of another
Shakespearean character which

00:53:57.750 --> 00:54:00.465 align:middle line:84%
is a personification
of Sagittarius,

00:54:00.465 --> 00:54:01.340 align:middle line:90%
it would be Falstaff.

00:54:01.340 --> 00:54:06.790 align:middle line:84%
It would be that very
jovial, that really open,

00:54:06.790 --> 00:54:11.920 align:middle line:84%
expansive, humorous
personality that enjoys life.

00:54:11.920 --> 00:54:16.490 align:middle line:84%
That's a very Sagittarian kind
of personification of the sign.

00:54:16.490 --> 00:54:18.660 align:middle line:84%
Some of the keywords of the
weaknesses that go along

00:54:18.660 --> 00:54:21.370 align:middle line:90%
with Sagittarius are sloppy.

00:54:21.370 --> 00:54:25.410 align:middle line:84%
They tend to be a little sloppy
at home, with their dress.

00:54:25.410 --> 00:54:27.970 align:middle line:90%
Cynical, they can be careless.

00:54:27.970 --> 00:54:30.030 align:middle line:84%
And as much as they can
be open and expansive,

00:54:30.030 --> 00:54:32.320 align:middle line:84%
they can also be really
quite judgmental, too.

00:54:32.320 --> 00:54:35.847 align:middle line:84%
There's a zealousness that can
be a part of the Sagittarian

00:54:35.847 --> 00:54:39.350 align:middle line:84%
personality because Sagittarius
is connected to religion,

00:54:39.350 --> 00:54:43.030 align:middle line:84%
or the lack of religion, which
would result in cynicism.

00:54:43.030 --> 00:54:45.350 align:middle line:90%
They can be cold.

00:54:45.350 --> 00:54:48.560 align:middle line:84%
As a personality
type, they're always

00:54:48.560 --> 00:54:51.560 align:middle line:84%
moving on to the next
adventure or what's

00:54:51.560 --> 00:54:54.380 align:middle line:84%
beyond the next hill,
what's over the next hill.

00:54:54.380 --> 00:54:56.850 align:middle line:84%
And as a result of that,
they can be a little cold

00:54:56.850 --> 00:54:59.350 align:middle line:84%
in terms of how they deal with
people because there's always

00:54:59.350 --> 00:55:00.510 align:middle line:90%
a new experience.

00:55:00.510 --> 00:55:02.630 align:middle line:84%
There's always
somebody else that

00:55:02.630 --> 00:55:05.610 align:middle line:84%
is on the other side of
whatever they're experiencing,

00:55:05.610 --> 00:55:07.690 align:middle line:84%
whether it's a
problem, whether it's

00:55:07.690 --> 00:55:09.910 align:middle line:84%
a challenge, a block
in their lives.

00:55:09.910 --> 00:55:12.050 align:middle line:84%
They can just make the
decisions and move on.

00:55:12.050 --> 00:55:15.260 align:middle line:84%
They can be really presumptive
and think that they know

00:55:15.260 --> 00:55:17.810 align:middle line:84%
everything, when in
fact, they don't.

00:55:17.810 --> 00:55:20.840 align:middle line:84%
So part of the practice
for a Sagittarius

00:55:20.840 --> 00:55:22.870 align:middle line:84%
is to remember and to
stay open to the fact

00:55:22.870 --> 00:55:26.170 align:middle line:84%
that they're always going to be
learning at some point in time

00:55:26.170 --> 00:55:27.090 align:middle line:90%
and at some level.

00:55:27.090 --> 00:55:29.860 align:middle line:84%
And believe it or not, they
can be a little bit rigid, too.

00:55:29.860 --> 00:55:31.360 align:middle line:84%
Here are the cultural
ciphers that I

00:55:31.360 --> 00:55:33.020 align:middle line:90%
thought were fairly interesting.

00:55:33.020 --> 00:55:36.640 align:middle line:84%
If you are a "Hunger Games" fan,
Katniss Everdeen and her bow

00:55:36.640 --> 00:55:38.620 align:middle line:84%
and arrow, she's
very Sagittarian.

00:55:38.620 --> 00:55:42.347 align:middle line:84%
In fact, the whole
"Hunger Games" trilogy

00:55:42.347 --> 00:55:43.180 align:middle line:90%
is very Sagittarian.

00:55:43.180 --> 00:55:49.030 align:middle line:84%
And in fact, I think it actually
was crafted and directed

00:55:49.030 --> 00:55:52.910 align:middle line:84%
towards the Pluto in
Sagittarius generation, which

00:55:52.910 --> 00:55:57.480 align:middle line:84%
has been very quick to consume
"The Hunger Games," both

00:55:57.480 --> 00:55:58.630 align:middle line:90%
the books and the films.

00:55:58.630 --> 00:56:04.200 align:middle line:84%
Jim Morrison, Sagittarius--
he's a guy that was Dionysian.

00:56:04.200 --> 00:56:07.220 align:middle line:84%
But there was also a
semi-religious aspect

00:56:07.220 --> 00:56:11.010 align:middle line:84%
to Morrison, but he was also
quite cynical at the same time.

00:56:11.010 --> 00:56:13.560 align:middle line:84%
The Kentucky Derby--
there's a social event

00:56:13.560 --> 00:56:15.400 align:middle line:84%
which, of course,
uses horses that

00:56:15.400 --> 00:56:17.740 align:middle line:90%
are part of its experience.

00:56:17.740 --> 00:56:19.750 align:middle line:84%
The Denver airport,
I thought, was

00:56:19.750 --> 00:56:22.410 align:middle line:90%
a very Sagittarian experience.

00:56:22.410 --> 00:56:24.150 align:middle line:84%
If you come into
the Denver airport,

00:56:24.150 --> 00:56:26.395 align:middle line:90%
you'll see this big giant horse.

00:56:26.395 --> 00:56:27.130 align:middle line:90%
It's blue.

00:56:27.130 --> 00:56:28.610 align:middle line:90%
It's got these big red eyes.

00:56:28.610 --> 00:56:31.340 align:middle line:84%
And that's the guardian
of the Denver airport.

00:56:31.340 --> 00:56:33.790 align:middle line:84%
William Tell, of course,
with the bow and arrow--

00:56:33.790 --> 00:56:36.130 align:middle line:84%
he's another Sagittarian
cultural cipher.

00:56:36.130 --> 00:56:39.160 align:middle line:84%
William Blake, the great
poet-- who, of course,

00:56:39.160 --> 00:56:41.120 align:middle line:84%
Jim Morrison took the
name of The Doors from,

00:56:41.120 --> 00:56:42.730 align:middle line:90%
"The Doors of Perception."

00:56:42.730 --> 00:56:45.190 align:middle line:84%
Sagittarius-- Keith Richards
and Little Richard--

00:56:45.190 --> 00:56:48.740 align:middle line:84%
both are Sagittarians,
and both slightly

00:56:48.740 --> 00:56:51.650 align:middle line:84%
excessive and expansive in
their own personal expression.

00:56:51.650 --> 00:56:53.170 align:middle line:84%
The highest octave
for Sagittarius

00:56:53.170 --> 00:56:54.979 align:middle line:84%
is "Hitting the target
without effort."

00:56:54.979 --> 00:56:55.520 align:middle line:90%
That's right.

00:56:55.520 --> 00:56:58.090 align:middle line:84%
If a Sagittarius can move
throughout their life

00:56:58.090 --> 00:57:00.120 align:middle line:84%
and hit their goals
and do it effortlessly,

00:57:00.120 --> 00:57:03.230 align:middle line:84%
they know that they're
on the right path.

00:57:03.230 --> 00:57:06.990 align:middle line:84%
Capricorn, the goat--
December 22, January 21.

00:57:06.990 --> 00:57:08.860 align:middle line:84%
The element for
Capricorn is earth.

00:57:08.860 --> 00:57:11.235 align:middle line:84%
It is the last of
the cardinal signs.

00:57:11.235 --> 00:57:12.610 align:middle line:84%
Of course, Pluto
is in Capricorn.

00:57:12.610 --> 00:57:16.710 align:middle line:84%
And we've been playing with
that for the last going

00:57:16.710 --> 00:57:17.810 align:middle line:90%
on-- what is it?

00:57:17.810 --> 00:57:22.130 align:middle line:84%
Four years now, five years--
2009, 2014-- five years.

00:57:22.130 --> 00:57:24.490 align:middle line:84%
So the key word, the
strengths for Capricorn--

00:57:24.490 --> 00:57:28.920 align:middle line:84%
responsible, patient, loyal,
ambitious, resourceful,

00:57:28.920 --> 00:57:30.390 align:middle line:90%
enduring, and methodical.

00:57:30.390 --> 00:57:33.000 align:middle line:84%
Capricorns, of course,
make great CEOs.

00:57:33.000 --> 00:57:35.020 align:middle line:84%
They make great
leaders in business.

00:57:35.020 --> 00:57:38.070 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes, they make
great leaders in politics.

00:57:38.070 --> 00:57:41.620 align:middle line:84%
Certainly, they will
take their time.

00:57:41.620 --> 00:57:43.460 align:middle line:90%
They will work hard.

00:57:43.460 --> 00:57:46.040 align:middle line:84%
They'll put in the
effort, the discipline,

00:57:46.040 --> 00:57:47.790 align:middle line:84%
and they'll display
responsibility

00:57:47.790 --> 00:57:49.470 align:middle line:90%
over an extended period of time.

00:57:49.470 --> 00:57:53.020 align:middle line:84%
And as a result, they get
promoted, promoted, promoted,

00:57:53.020 --> 00:57:54.044 align:middle line:90%
promoted.

00:57:54.044 --> 00:57:55.710 align:middle line:84%
One of the symbols--
we'll get into this

00:57:55.710 --> 00:57:58.830 align:middle line:84%
here-- is the pyramid
for a Capricorn.

00:57:58.830 --> 00:58:02.820 align:middle line:84%
And it's that graduated rise
to the top, which is also

00:58:02.820 --> 00:58:04.960 align:middle line:84%
symbolic of the mountain
and the mountain goat,

00:58:04.960 --> 00:58:07.130 align:middle line:84%
which is part of the
Capricornian nature.

00:58:07.130 --> 00:58:08.630 align:middle line:84%
The key words and
the weaknesses are

00:58:08.630 --> 00:58:13.790 align:middle line:84%
dictatorial, inhibited,
conceited, distrusting,

00:58:13.790 --> 00:58:17.790 align:middle line:84%
unimaginative, cool, and again,
like its other sign or the sign

00:58:17.790 --> 00:58:19.940 align:middle line:84%
that's opposite to
Capricorn, Cancer,

00:58:19.940 --> 00:58:24.950 align:middle line:84%
they can be very-- how shall I
say this-- tight with a buck.

00:58:24.950 --> 00:58:27.250 align:middle line:84%
Capricorns like to
hold onto their money,

00:58:27.250 --> 00:58:30.220 align:middle line:84%
just like Cancers do, but
for different reasons.

00:58:30.220 --> 00:58:32.510 align:middle line:84%
Capricorns generally
want to invest that money

00:58:32.510 --> 00:58:35.060 align:middle line:84%
and put it towards
new projects or stocks

00:58:35.060 --> 00:58:39.560 align:middle line:90%
or bonds or new business.

00:58:39.560 --> 00:58:41.160 align:middle line:84%
One of the things
about Capricorns

00:58:41.160 --> 00:58:43.430 align:middle line:84%
is that they actually have
a great sense of humor.

00:58:43.430 --> 00:58:45.346 align:middle line:84%
And you have to get to
know them a little bit,

00:58:45.346 --> 00:58:48.930 align:middle line:84%
but they can be very
wry, very sardonic, very

00:58:48.930 --> 00:58:53.350 align:middle line:84%
dry sense of humor,
witty, satirical.

00:58:53.350 --> 00:58:55.310 align:middle line:84%
But you have to spend
time around a Capricorn

00:58:55.310 --> 00:58:58.520 align:middle line:84%
to understand them, to get to
know that part of who they are.

00:58:58.520 --> 00:59:02.430 align:middle line:84%
The other thing about Capricorns
is that, as they get older,

00:59:02.430 --> 00:59:03.520 align:middle line:90%
they're getting younger.

00:59:03.520 --> 00:59:05.840 align:middle line:84%
So all of you Capricorns
out there or people

00:59:05.840 --> 00:59:09.230 align:middle line:84%
that have Capricorn rising,
your best days are ahead of you.

00:59:09.230 --> 00:59:12.130 align:middle line:84%
While everybody else is starting
to break down and wear down,

00:59:12.130 --> 00:59:14.350 align:middle line:84%
you're really starting
to come into your skin

00:59:14.350 --> 00:59:15.610 align:middle line:90%
and come into your own.

00:59:15.610 --> 00:59:17.610 align:middle line:84%
And when we look at one
of the cultural ciphers,

00:59:17.610 --> 00:59:20.700 align:middle line:84%
there's been a film over the
course of the last few years

00:59:20.700 --> 00:59:22.170 align:middle line:90%
that personifies this.

00:59:22.170 --> 00:59:23.700 align:middle line:84%
So some of those
cultural ciphers

00:59:23.700 --> 00:59:26.154 align:middle line:90%
are the One World Freedom Tower.

00:59:26.154 --> 00:59:27.820 align:middle line:84%
So we went from the
Twin Towers, Gemini,

00:59:27.820 --> 00:59:29.320 align:middle line:90%
to the One World Freedom Tower.

00:59:29.320 --> 00:59:31.725 align:middle line:84%
That is the manifestation
of Capricorn and Pluto

00:59:31.725 --> 00:59:32.940 align:middle line:90%
in Capricorn.

00:59:32.940 --> 00:59:36.030 align:middle line:84%
Martin Luther
King, Muhammad Ali,

00:59:36.030 --> 00:59:41.230 align:middle line:84%
the World Bank, Mount Everest--
another natural symbol

00:59:41.230 --> 00:59:42.940 align:middle line:90%
of Capricorn.

00:59:42.940 --> 00:59:45.430 align:middle line:84%
The board room,
David Bowie, one of

00:59:45.430 --> 00:59:47.400 align:middle line:84%
my personal favorite
Capricorns-- in fact,

00:59:47.400 --> 00:59:49.790 align:middle line:84%
it's David Bowie's
birthday tomorrow.

00:59:49.790 --> 00:59:53.680 align:middle line:84%
Gordon Gekko from Wall Street--
very Capricornian, greed

00:59:53.680 --> 00:59:54.510 align:middle line:90%
is good.

00:59:54.510 --> 00:59:57.120 align:middle line:84%
Carlos Casteneda
was a Capricorn.

00:59:57.120 --> 01:00:00.520 align:middle line:84%
And he was an
interesting character.

01:00:00.520 --> 01:00:04.940 align:middle line:84%
And we also have the Fed,
another current cultural cipher

01:00:04.940 --> 01:00:06.170 align:middle line:90%
for Capricorn.

01:00:06.170 --> 01:00:07.960 align:middle line:84%
Benjamin Button--
some of you people

01:00:07.960 --> 01:00:11.141 align:middle line:84%
might have seen the film,
"The Amazing Tale of Benjamin

01:00:11.141 --> 01:00:11.640 align:middle line:90%
Button."

01:00:11.640 --> 01:00:13.530 align:middle line:84%
I think that's the
full name of the movie.

01:00:13.530 --> 01:00:15.460 align:middle line:90%
It stars Brad Pitt.

01:00:15.460 --> 01:00:19.880 align:middle line:84%
Within that film, he starts
off, he's born as an old man.

01:00:19.880 --> 01:00:22.660 align:middle line:84%
And then he kind of has
this reverse aging process.

01:00:22.660 --> 01:00:25.270 align:middle line:84%
And by the end of his life,
he's very young again.

01:00:25.270 --> 01:00:26.360 align:middle line:90%
He's like a baby.

01:00:26.360 --> 01:00:31.010 align:middle line:84%
And in some ways, that is a
manifestation of Capricorn.

01:00:31.010 --> 01:00:34.970 align:middle line:84%
It's a cinematic portrayal
of the arc of Capricorn

01:00:34.970 --> 01:00:35.860 align:middle line:90%
through life.

01:00:35.860 --> 01:00:38.420 align:middle line:84%
Capricorns, generally--
they look like old souls

01:00:38.420 --> 01:00:39.340 align:middle line:90%
when they're young.

01:00:39.340 --> 01:00:41.290 align:middle line:84%
They can have a lot of
responsibility heaped

01:00:41.290 --> 01:00:42.086 align:middle line:90%
upon them.

01:00:42.086 --> 01:00:43.460 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes, they're
the oldest kid

01:00:43.460 --> 01:00:45.690 align:middle line:84%
in a large family,
whatever that thing is.

01:00:45.690 --> 01:00:48.190 align:middle line:84%
But as they get older,
they tend to get younger.

01:00:48.190 --> 01:00:51.610 align:middle line:84%
And Benjamin Button is
the cinematic portrayal

01:00:51.610 --> 01:00:53.240 align:middle line:90%
of that Capricornian arc.

01:00:53.240 --> 01:00:56.180 align:middle line:84%
And of course, Baphomet
is another very prominent

01:00:56.180 --> 01:00:59.340 align:middle line:90%
cultural symbol of Capricorn.

01:00:59.340 --> 01:01:02.810 align:middle line:84%
The highest octave for
Capricorn-- "Plan for eternity,

01:01:02.810 --> 01:01:03.771 align:middle line:90%
live in the now."

01:01:03.771 --> 01:01:04.270 align:middle line:90%
OK.

01:01:04.270 --> 01:01:05.310 align:middle line:90%
Here we go.

01:01:05.310 --> 01:01:08.430 align:middle line:84%
Just two more-- we've
got Aquarius, January 23

01:01:08.430 --> 01:01:09.770 align:middle line:90%
to February 20.

01:01:09.770 --> 01:01:11.600 align:middle line:90%
The element for Aquarius is air.

01:01:11.600 --> 01:01:13.164 align:middle line:90%
The energy is fixed.

01:01:13.164 --> 01:01:14.580 align:middle line:84%
And the keywords
and the strengths

01:01:14.580 --> 01:01:19.250 align:middle line:84%
are witty, clever, original,
inventive, scientific.

01:01:19.250 --> 01:01:20.850 align:middle line:90%
They're humanitarian.

01:01:20.850 --> 01:01:23.020 align:middle line:90%
And they're electric.

01:01:23.020 --> 01:01:25.400 align:middle line:84%
One of the things that I've
noticed about Aquarians--

01:01:25.400 --> 01:01:27.632 align:middle line:84%
and I have a couple
of Aquarian friends.

01:01:27.632 --> 01:01:30.090 align:middle line:84%
And they're great people, and
I love hanging out with them.

01:01:30.090 --> 01:01:34.000 align:middle line:84%
But I never really get a sense
as to knowing them all the way.

01:01:34.000 --> 01:01:36.330 align:middle line:84%
There's always something
about an Aquarius

01:01:36.330 --> 01:01:40.150 align:middle line:84%
that they hold back from
themselves, to some extent,

01:01:40.150 --> 01:01:42.780 align:middle line:84%
but certainly from
the rest of the world.

01:01:42.780 --> 01:01:46.450 align:middle line:84%
There's a detached part
of the Aquarian nature

01:01:46.450 --> 01:01:49.850 align:middle line:84%
which is really private,
in a lot of ways.

01:01:49.850 --> 01:01:52.290 align:middle line:84%
And it's an
interesting component

01:01:52.290 --> 01:01:54.140 align:middle line:90%
to the Aquarius personality.

01:01:54.140 --> 01:01:57.480 align:middle line:84%
They're a fixed sign, so
they can be really stubborn.

01:01:57.480 --> 01:01:59.010 align:middle line:90%
Here's the irony about Aquarius.

01:01:59.010 --> 01:02:00.240 align:middle line:90%
They can be really open.

01:02:00.240 --> 01:02:04.640 align:middle line:84%
They can be really tolerant,
really progressive.

01:02:04.640 --> 01:02:09.490 align:middle line:84%
And they can champion
gay rights or they

01:02:09.490 --> 01:02:15.260 align:middle line:84%
can champion the ability for the
races to come together and live

01:02:15.260 --> 01:02:18.150 align:middle line:84%
as one universal family
and whatever that is,

01:02:18.150 --> 01:02:20.250 align:middle line:90%
or the environment or animals.

01:02:20.250 --> 01:02:22.340 align:middle line:84%
They can be really
cause-oriented people

01:02:22.340 --> 01:02:23.400 align:middle line:90%
and very open.

01:02:23.400 --> 01:02:25.150 align:middle line:84%
But they can also be
really stubborn, too.

01:02:25.150 --> 01:02:28.980 align:middle line:84%
So inasmuch as there's this open
architecture to the Aquarian

01:02:28.980 --> 01:02:31.840 align:middle line:84%
personality, there's
definitely limits.

01:02:31.840 --> 01:02:33.700 align:middle line:84%
And if you cross a
line with an Aquarius,

01:02:33.700 --> 01:02:36.250 align:middle line:84%
especially if it's
an ideological line,

01:02:36.250 --> 01:02:37.990 align:middle line:90%
that stubbornness will come up.

01:02:37.990 --> 01:02:42.970 align:middle line:84%
Aloofness, a bit of a detached
air with an Aquarius--

01:02:42.970 --> 01:02:46.020 align:middle line:84%
they can certainly be a
little bit on the cruel side,

01:02:46.020 --> 01:02:47.540 align:middle line:90%
sarcastic, rebellious.

01:02:47.540 --> 01:02:49.860 align:middle line:84%
Aquarius is the
sign of the rebel.

01:02:49.860 --> 01:02:52.340 align:middle line:84%
Just like all the other air
signs-- Libra and Gemini--

01:02:52.340 --> 01:02:55.470 align:middle line:84%
they can be a bit
unemotional and clinical.

01:02:55.470 --> 01:02:59.270 align:middle line:84%
Certainly, Aquarius is the
most detached of all three

01:02:59.270 --> 01:03:01.610 align:middle line:84%
of the air signs, because
it's the most transpersonal.

01:03:01.610 --> 01:03:04.660 align:middle line:84%
It's the one sign that is
most closely associated

01:03:04.660 --> 01:03:06.150 align:middle line:90%
with science.

01:03:06.150 --> 01:03:07.890 align:middle line:84%
Some of the cultural
ciphers for Aquarius

01:03:07.890 --> 01:03:10.710 align:middle line:84%
are Johnny Rotten, the lead
singer of the Sex Pistols,

01:03:10.710 --> 01:03:11.660 align:middle line:90%
who is an Aquarius.

01:03:11.660 --> 01:03:13.740 align:middle line:84%
Punk rock is an
Aquarian art form.

01:03:13.740 --> 01:03:18.675 align:middle line:84%
The internet, UFOs, Facebook--
the social network phenomenon

01:03:18.675 --> 01:03:20.630 align:middle line:84%
is a very Aquarian
kind of experience.

01:03:20.630 --> 01:03:24.400 align:middle line:84%
Twitter, androids,
and this whole notion

01:03:24.400 --> 01:03:29.960 align:middle line:84%
of having not necessary
replacement humans,

01:03:29.960 --> 01:03:33.630 align:middle line:84%
but the possibility and
potential of having androids

01:03:33.630 --> 01:03:35.780 align:middle line:90%
walking side by side with us.

01:03:35.780 --> 01:03:37.800 align:middle line:90%
Surveillance is very Aquarius.

01:03:37.800 --> 01:03:39.580 align:middle line:84%
Synthesizers--
electronic synthesizer

01:03:39.580 --> 01:03:43.320 align:middle line:84%
is a very Aquarian
kind of instrument

01:03:43.320 --> 01:03:45.180 align:middle line:90%
in the 20th and 21st century.

01:03:45.180 --> 01:03:50.200 align:middle line:84%
Rainbows, crystals, Atlantis,
harp, weather modification,

01:03:50.200 --> 01:03:54.580 align:middle line:84%
the singularity, sex positive,
porn, color revolutions,

01:03:54.580 --> 01:03:57.690 align:middle line:84%
collective mind-- these
are all cultural ciphers.

01:03:57.690 --> 01:04:00.320 align:middle line:84%
And the highest
octave for Aquarius

01:04:00.320 --> 01:04:03.690 align:middle line:84%
is to be "Transpersonal
with care."

01:04:03.690 --> 01:04:07.290 align:middle line:84%
And lastly, we come to Pisces--
almost as misunderstood

01:04:07.290 --> 01:04:09.170 align:middle line:90%
as Virgo, perhaps maybe more.

01:04:09.170 --> 01:04:11.910 align:middle line:84%
February 21, March 22--
the element is water.

01:04:11.910 --> 01:04:13.070 align:middle line:90%
The energy's mutable.

01:04:13.070 --> 01:04:14.890 align:middle line:84%
And the keyword
strengths for Pisces

01:04:14.890 --> 01:04:19.840 align:middle line:84%
are compassionate, devoted,
accepting, imaginative, kind,

01:04:19.840 --> 01:04:22.370 align:middle line:90%
flowing, peaceful, artistic.

01:04:22.370 --> 01:04:24.330 align:middle line:90%
I have this theory about Pisces.

01:04:24.330 --> 01:04:28.560 align:middle line:84%
And my theory is that
Pisces has every other sign

01:04:28.560 --> 01:04:31.950 align:middle line:84%
as part of its own sign,
because it's the 12th sign.

01:04:31.950 --> 01:04:33.430 align:middle line:90%
It's the last sign.

01:04:33.430 --> 01:04:36.740 align:middle line:84%
So one of the things that
makes them so complex in terms

01:04:36.740 --> 01:04:39.820 align:middle line:84%
of their personal expression is
that they're not just Pisces,

01:04:39.820 --> 01:04:42.870 align:middle line:84%
but they're Pisces and Aquarius
and Capricorn and Sagittarius

01:04:42.870 --> 01:04:45.280 align:middle line:84%
and Scorpio and all the
other signs before it.

01:04:45.280 --> 01:04:48.100 align:middle line:84%
And it all gets mixed
up into this sort

01:04:48.100 --> 01:04:51.010 align:middle line:84%
of astrological
or cosmic miasma.

01:04:51.010 --> 01:04:53.450 align:middle line:90%
And the surface layer is Pisces.

01:04:53.450 --> 01:04:54.510 align:middle line:90%
That's what we see.

01:04:54.510 --> 01:04:58.090 align:middle line:84%
But beneath it is this
roiling amalgamation

01:04:58.090 --> 01:04:59.890 align:middle line:84%
of every single sign
that's gone before it.

01:04:59.890 --> 01:05:02.060 align:middle line:84%
And that's why Pisces
can show up differently

01:05:02.060 --> 01:05:03.057 align:middle line:90%
at different times.

01:05:03.057 --> 01:05:05.140 align:middle line:84%
If you've ever hung for
an extended period of time

01:05:05.140 --> 01:05:06.850 align:middle line:84%
with a Pisces, all
of a sudden there

01:05:06.850 --> 01:05:09.290 align:middle line:84%
will be another aspect
of their character

01:05:09.290 --> 01:05:11.750 align:middle line:84%
or another component
to their personality

01:05:11.750 --> 01:05:13.350 align:middle line:90%
that you haven't seen before.

01:05:13.350 --> 01:05:14.920 align:middle line:84%
And the reason why
is it that it's

01:05:14.920 --> 01:05:18.200 align:middle line:84%
part of this really
complex amalgamation of all

01:05:18.200 --> 01:05:21.620 align:middle line:84%
the other signs that are rising
to the surface of the Piscean

01:05:21.620 --> 01:05:22.580 align:middle line:90%
experience.

01:05:22.580 --> 01:05:24.110 align:middle line:84%
Some of the
weaknesses for Pisces

01:05:24.110 --> 01:05:27.000 align:middle line:84%
are oversensitivity,
indecisiveness,

01:05:27.000 --> 01:05:32.060 align:middle line:84%
being a bit on the lazy side,
self pitying, escapist or being

01:05:32.060 --> 01:05:35.340 align:middle line:84%
involved in escapism,
martyr, and depressed.

01:05:35.340 --> 01:05:37.480 align:middle line:84%
Pisces can be very
hard on themselves.

01:05:37.480 --> 01:05:42.500 align:middle line:84%
The most sensitive sign in the
zodiac, bar none, is Pisces.

01:05:42.500 --> 01:05:44.030 align:middle line:84%
And some of the
cultural signifiers

01:05:44.030 --> 01:05:46.660 align:middle line:84%
are, of course, the
age of Pisces, Jesus.

01:05:46.660 --> 01:05:49.960 align:middle line:84%
Flipper, our friend the dolphin,
very Piscean-- Kurt Cobain,

01:05:49.960 --> 01:05:54.320 align:middle line:84%
zero degrees Pisces,
voice of a generation,

01:05:54.320 --> 01:05:56.560 align:middle line:90%
suicide, theoretically.

01:05:56.560 --> 01:06:02.250 align:middle line:84%
India , very Piscean country--
Fukushima, dealing with,

01:06:02.250 --> 01:06:07.840 align:middle line:84%
of course, the ocean and the
crises of Pisces in our time.

01:06:07.840 --> 01:06:11.770 align:middle line:84%
Sushi, heroin-- another
culture signifier--

01:06:11.770 --> 01:06:15.100 align:middle line:84%
not just the planet Neptune,
but also the god Neptune.

01:06:15.100 --> 01:06:18.270 align:middle line:84%
Lenny Bruce, who I believe was
a Pisces-- don't quote me on it,

01:06:18.270 --> 01:06:20.580 align:middle line:84%
but I think he was a
Pisces-- who literally

01:06:20.580 --> 01:06:22.700 align:middle line:84%
died for the sins
of other comedians.

01:06:22.700 --> 01:06:27.150 align:middle line:84%
Aquaman, Anais Nin, who was a
Pisces, the tar sands pipeline

01:06:27.150 --> 01:06:30.610 align:middle line:84%
and fracking-- those are
also cultural signifiers

01:06:30.610 --> 01:06:32.206 align:middle line:90%
of Pisces for our time.

01:06:32.206 --> 01:06:33.580 align:middle line:84%
And the highest
octave for Pisces

01:06:33.580 --> 01:06:36.320 align:middle line:84%
is "To merge with all things
and remain conscious,"

01:06:36.320 --> 01:06:38.680 align:middle line:84%
because Pisces has
no other option.

01:06:38.680 --> 01:06:42.460 align:middle line:84%
They've got no other
ability or end game,

01:06:42.460 --> 01:06:45.520 align:middle line:84%
so to speak, because their
goal and their mission in life

01:06:45.520 --> 01:06:47.070 align:middle line:90%
is to merge.

01:06:47.070 --> 01:06:48.630 align:middle line:90%
So that's it for today's show.

01:06:48.630 --> 01:06:51.100 align:middle line:84%
Thank you for joining
me as we explored

01:06:51.100 --> 01:06:52.800 align:middle line:90%
the 12 signs of the zodiac.

01:06:52.800 --> 01:06:56.710 align:middle line:84%
And join me again for another
episode in The Eleventh House.

01:06:56.710 --> 01:07:00.200 align:middle line:90%
I'm your host, Robert Phoenix.

01:07:00.200 --> 01:07:11.667 align:middle line:90%
