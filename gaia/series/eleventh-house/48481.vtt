00:00:16.657 --> 00:00:18.490 align:middle line:10%
>>ROBERT PHOENIX: Hi
there, and welcome back

00:00:18.490 --> 00:00:20.281 align:middle line:10%
to another episode of
"The Eleventh House."

00:00:20.281 --> 00:00:22.490 align:middle line:10%
I'm Robert Phoenix,
And today we are

00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:24.210 align:middle line:10%
going to look at
something that's

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:26.050 align:middle line:10%
pretty newsworthy
and very current

00:00:26.050 --> 00:00:28.740 align:middle line:10%
and will probably have
a fairly long tail

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:32.950 align:middle line:10%
both in our current news
cycle and as we move forward

00:00:32.950 --> 00:00:33.640 align:middle line:10%
into the future.

00:00:33.640 --> 00:00:36.700 align:middle line:84%
And I'm talking about
what's happening in Ukraine,

00:00:36.700 --> 00:00:41.880 align:middle line:84%
and we're going to look at the
astrology of the event related

00:00:41.880 --> 00:00:44.970 align:middle line:84%
to the Ukrainian, quote
unquote, "Revolution."

00:00:44.970 --> 00:00:47.840 align:middle line:84%
And we're going to look at some
historical players, both past,

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:52.610 align:middle line:84%
present, and future and try
to determine where this is all

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:56.650 align:middle line:84%
going and what the impetus
for the Ukrainian Revolution

00:00:56.650 --> 00:00:58.360 align:middle line:90%
might actually be.

00:00:58.360 --> 00:01:01.510 align:middle line:84%
So without further ado,
let's jump into this

00:01:01.510 --> 00:01:04.690 align:middle line:84%
and get "Ukraine
in the Membrane."

00:01:04.690 --> 00:01:05.390 align:middle line:90%
Here's Ukraine.

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:06.130 align:middle line:90%
This is the flag.

00:01:06.130 --> 00:01:06.480 align:middle line:90%
It's the blue.

00:01:06.480 --> 00:01:07.146 align:middle line:10%
It's the yellow.

00:01:07.146 --> 00:01:09.770 align:middle line:10%
You guys have seen it,
fairly popular color scheme

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:10.890 align:middle line:10%
these days.

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:12.730 align:middle line:10%
So what's interesting
about Ukraine

00:01:12.730 --> 00:01:15.460 align:middle line:10%
is that the inhabitants
for that area

00:01:15.460 --> 00:01:18.510 align:middle line:10%
can be traced back
for 44,000 years.

00:01:18.510 --> 00:01:22.870 align:middle line:84%
So this is actually a fairly
ancient part of the world.

00:01:22.870 --> 00:01:27.120 align:middle line:84%
And in fact, if you go to
the east and then the south

00:01:27.120 --> 00:01:29.630 align:middle line:84%
and you get into
Crimea, there have

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:33.215 align:middle line:84%
been pyramids that have been
discovered there recently.

00:01:33.215 --> 00:01:35.090 align:middle line:84%
I'm sure they've been
discovered before this,

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:38.790 align:middle line:84%
but they become newsworthy
over the past couple of weeks.

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:44.660 align:middle line:84%
So that will attest to
the ancient relationship

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:47.254 align:middle line:84%
to a almost antediluvian
culture that

00:01:47.254 --> 00:01:49.420 align:middle line:84%
exists in this part of the
world, probably even back

00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:51.490 align:middle line:90%
further than 44,000 years.

00:01:51.490 --> 00:01:54.300 align:middle line:10%
There are 18 languages
spoken in Ukraine,

00:01:54.300 --> 00:01:57.860 align:middle line:10%
so it's a diverse population.

00:01:57.860 --> 00:02:02.120 align:middle line:10%
And at the end of the
seventh century AD,

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:04.700 align:middle line:10%
Eastern Ukraine,
which is kind of what

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:06.990 align:middle line:10%
we're talking about now
because the Eastern Ukraine

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:09.720 align:middle line:10%
has become the area
that in some ways

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:13.810 align:middle line:10%
staged or was very
prevalent in this revolution

00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:18.780 align:middle line:10%
and has also brought
forth its current leader,

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:20.580 align:middle line:10%
its prime minister.

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:24.480 align:middle line:10%
So Eastern Ukraine was the
center of Old Great Bulgaria.

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:27.320 align:middle line:10%
So it gives you kind
of an understanding

00:02:27.320 --> 00:02:29.720 align:middle line:10%
of sort of the topography
of that region.

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:32.290 align:middle line:10%
And we'll look at Ukraine
on the map in a second.

00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:35.030 align:middle line:10%
Then the Bulgarian
tribes migrated,

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:38.960 align:middle line:10%
and Ukraine was taken
over by the Khazars.

00:02:38.960 --> 00:02:41.630 align:middle line:10%
And we're going to talk about
the Khazars a little bit,

00:02:41.630 --> 00:02:45.640 align:middle line:10%
especially as we get further
into today's episode.

00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:48.040 align:middle line:84%
It's a controversial
subject and topic,

00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:51.340 align:middle line:84%
and we're going to try to
treat it as intelligently

00:02:51.340 --> 00:02:53.940 align:middle line:84%
and as thoughtfully
as we possibly can.

00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:58.150 align:middle line:84%
But it's a really interesting
piece of history that has,

00:02:58.150 --> 00:02:59.750 align:middle line:84%
I think, a lot of
resonance to what's

00:02:59.750 --> 00:03:01.900 align:middle line:90%
taking place in Ukraine today.

00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:03.980 align:middle line:90%
So let's move forward here.

00:03:03.980 --> 00:03:06.930 align:middle line:84%
So the Ukrainian
Revolution took place

00:03:06.930 --> 00:03:10.660 align:middle line:84%
between February 18
and February 24th.

00:03:10.660 --> 00:03:13.890 align:middle line:84%
Those are the final
degrees of Aries,

00:03:13.890 --> 00:03:18.540 align:middle line:84%
and we're going to look at
the chart for that time,

00:03:18.540 --> 00:03:21.480 align:middle line:84%
specifically February 18
when everything kicked off,

00:03:21.480 --> 00:03:24.660 align:middle line:84%
and we're going to see
the role Aquarius plays

00:03:24.660 --> 00:03:28.260 align:middle line:84%
in the revolution
of Ukraine, and not

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:31.050 align:middle line:84%
just Ukraine but some
other countries as well.

00:03:31.050 --> 00:03:35.300 align:middle line:84%
Ukraine is the home of
the domesticated horse.

00:03:35.300 --> 00:03:38.210 align:middle line:84%
Horses were
domesticated in Ukraine.

00:03:38.210 --> 00:03:39.130 align:middle line:90%
And where are we?

00:03:39.130 --> 00:03:43.040 align:middle line:84%
We are in the "Year
of the Horse."

00:03:43.040 --> 00:03:45.190 align:middle line:84%
It's one of those
interesting little factoids

00:03:45.190 --> 00:03:46.920 align:middle line:84%
that kind of come
together when we

00:03:46.920 --> 00:03:49.460 align:middle line:84%
start to mash these
synchronicities up,

00:03:49.460 --> 00:03:51.650 align:middle line:84%
and there are quite
a few as you'll see.

00:03:51.650 --> 00:03:54.020 align:middle line:10%
Now, here we have Katy Perry.

00:03:54.020 --> 00:03:58.311 align:middle line:10%
And of course, she's
sporting the Eye of Horus,

00:03:58.311 --> 00:03:59.060 align:middle line:10%
literally the eye.

00:03:59.060 --> 00:04:01.379 align:middle line:10%
I mean, they're getting
really incredibly blatant

00:04:01.379 --> 00:04:02.920 align:middle line:10%
with their symbolism
in these videos.

00:04:02.920 --> 00:04:03.670 align:middle line:10%
They don't really care anymore.

00:04:03.670 --> 00:04:05.794 align:middle line:10%
They're just going to throw
it in everybody's face.

00:04:05.794 --> 00:04:07.420 align:middle line:10%
It's just all a real joke now.

00:04:07.420 --> 00:04:13.632 align:middle line:10%
So "Dark Horse," her video,
debuted on 1/26/14, and that

00:04:13.632 --> 00:04:14.590 align:middle line:10%
was during the Grammys.

00:04:14.590 --> 00:04:18.760 align:middle line:84%
And of course, the sign
was under Aquarius.

00:04:18.760 --> 00:04:21.220 align:middle line:84%
The sun sign was
Aquarius at that time.

00:04:21.220 --> 00:04:25.320 align:middle line:84%
And that's really just a
few days before February 2,

00:04:25.320 --> 00:04:27.240 align:middle line:84%
actually it was
February 1, which

00:04:27.240 --> 00:04:31.240 align:middle line:84%
was when Philip Seymour
Hoffman died in New York City

00:04:31.240 --> 00:04:34.470 align:middle line:84%
just prior to the
Super Bowl, which

00:04:34.470 --> 00:04:40.040 align:middle line:84%
had the Denver Broncos, another
horse symbol, very prevalent

00:04:40.040 --> 00:04:42.880 align:middle line:84%
in the theater of the
Super Bowl and this kind

00:04:42.880 --> 00:04:46.350 align:middle line:84%
of astrological matrix that
we're working with here.

00:04:46.350 --> 00:04:49.240 align:middle line:84%
And what's also
interesting is that Philip

00:04:49.240 --> 00:04:51.740 align:middle line:90%
means "lover of horses."

00:04:51.740 --> 00:04:54.730 align:middle line:84%
So now we have this horse
theme in the Year of the Horse

00:04:54.730 --> 00:04:57.760 align:middle line:84%
being sort of concurrent
throughout all this.

00:04:57.760 --> 00:05:04.190 align:middle line:10%
And the video for "Dark
Horse" was released on 2/20/14

00:05:04.190 --> 00:05:07.600 align:middle line:10%
while Ukraine was
having its revolution.

00:05:07.600 --> 00:05:09.610 align:middle line:10%
It's pretty interesting
in terms of timing.

00:05:09.610 --> 00:05:12.700 align:middle line:10%
If you haven't seen
Katy Perry's performance

00:05:12.700 --> 00:05:16.210 align:middle line:10%
of "Dark Horse" on the
Grammys, I highly recommend it.

00:05:16.210 --> 00:05:19.680 align:middle line:84%
It is a fairly dark
ritual in and of itself

00:05:19.680 --> 00:05:21.670 align:middle line:84%
and kind of worth
your time if you're

00:05:21.670 --> 00:05:24.430 align:middle line:84%
into deconstructing
these kinds of things.

00:05:24.430 --> 00:05:27.760 align:middle line:84%
So this gives you an
idea and an example

00:05:27.760 --> 00:05:30.000 align:middle line:90%
of the geography of Ukraine.

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:32.970 align:middle line:10%
So the eastern part is really
where all the action is taking

00:05:32.970 --> 00:05:36.540 align:middle line:10%
place, and this is the area
that was occupied by the Khazars

00:05:36.540 --> 00:05:39.130 align:middle line:10%
at one point in time.

00:05:39.130 --> 00:05:42.470 align:middle line:10%
So not only did the
Ukrainian Revolution

00:05:42.470 --> 00:05:45.380 align:middle line:10%
take place during the
final degrees of Aquarius,

00:05:45.380 --> 00:05:48.050 align:middle line:10%
but if we look at the
color revolutions,

00:05:48.050 --> 00:05:51.730 align:middle line:10%
they also took place on 1/27/11.

00:05:51.730 --> 00:05:54.440 align:middle line:10%
That's right at the
beginning of Aquarius.

00:05:54.440 --> 00:05:56.990 align:middle line:10%
That is the Yemeni Revolution.

00:05:56.990 --> 00:06:01.510 align:middle line:10%
And then it rolls right into the
first Egyptian Revolution, not

00:06:01.510 --> 00:06:04.900 align:middle line:10%
the second one, but
the first one, 1/25.

00:06:04.900 --> 00:06:06.640 align:middle line:10%
This one didn't last
that long, did it?

00:06:06.640 --> 00:06:08.030 align:middle line:10%
No, it was kind
of over in a day.

00:06:08.030 --> 00:06:10.040 align:middle line:10%
Actually, it was
a month, 30 days.

00:06:10.040 --> 00:06:14.000 align:middle line:10%
And this one lasted until
2/11/11, at least the first

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:15.120 align:middle line:10%
go 'round.

00:06:15.120 --> 00:06:18.470 align:middle line:10%
And then they tried to crank
it up here in Libya on 2/15.

00:06:18.470 --> 00:06:21.090 align:middle line:10%
Again, 1/25 is Aquarius.

00:06:21.090 --> 00:06:24.270 align:middle line:10%
2/15 is also Aquarius.

00:06:24.270 --> 00:06:28.860 align:middle line:10%
But Gadaffi, he didn't really
go down all that easily,

00:06:28.860 --> 00:06:31.420 align:middle line:10%
so they really couldn't
turn the tables

00:06:31.420 --> 00:06:35.560 align:middle line:10%
until the 23rd of
October, which would

00:06:35.560 --> 00:06:37.900 align:middle line:10%
make it the first
day of Scorpio.

00:06:37.900 --> 00:06:42.910 align:middle line:10%
So we would have here a square
between Aquarius and Scorpio.

00:06:42.910 --> 00:06:45.780 align:middle line:10%
That is the alchemical square.

00:06:45.780 --> 00:06:49.220 align:middle line:84%
Aquarius is the eagle, and
Scorpio is the serpent.

00:06:49.220 --> 00:06:54.670 align:middle line:10%
So they had performed some
kind of alchemical, magical act

00:06:54.670 --> 00:06:56.549 align:middle line:10%
as part of the
Libyan Revolution.

00:06:56.549 --> 00:06:58.840 align:middle line:10%
And then, of course, here we
have Ukrainian Revolution,

00:06:58.840 --> 00:07:02.330 align:middle line:10%
2/18/13 to 2/23/14.

00:07:02.330 --> 00:07:04.580 align:middle line:10%
And while I was
looking for pictures

00:07:04.580 --> 00:07:07.870 align:middle line:10%
to represent these revolutions,
it was really interesting,

00:07:07.870 --> 00:07:10.290 align:middle line:10%
because with almost
every revolution,

00:07:10.290 --> 00:07:14.530 align:middle line:10%
I was able to find a person
who is front and center raising

00:07:14.530 --> 00:07:20.430 align:middle line:10%
their arms in some sort of
triumphant sort of gesture.

00:07:20.430 --> 00:07:23.950 align:middle line:10%
And so it was almost like they
were brought in from revolution

00:07:23.950 --> 00:07:27.310 align:middle line:10%
casting central so
that they could depict

00:07:27.310 --> 00:07:30.220 align:middle line:10%
a moment of victory in
the individual, right?

00:07:30.220 --> 00:07:31.000 align:middle line:90%
This is Aquarius.

00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:34.400 align:middle line:84%
This is the individual rising
kind of above the masses,

00:07:34.400 --> 00:07:36.880 align:middle line:84%
and yet the masses are
still involved here.

00:07:36.880 --> 00:07:41.560 align:middle line:84%
So these are symbols of Aquarius
during these revolutions.

00:07:41.560 --> 00:07:43.580 align:middle line:84%
Now, you have to
ask yourself, why

00:07:43.580 --> 00:07:45.082 align:middle line:84%
are they starting
these revolutions

00:07:45.082 --> 00:07:46.290 align:middle line:90%
during the month of Aquarius?

00:07:46.290 --> 00:07:48.060 align:middle line:84%
Well, of course,
Aquarius is rebellious

00:07:48.060 --> 00:07:49.820 align:middle line:84%
and is synonymous
with revolution.

00:07:49.820 --> 00:07:53.760 align:middle line:84%
So we're seeing this as part of
the astrological event canon.

00:07:53.760 --> 00:07:57.320 align:middle line:84%
But perhaps there
is another reason.

00:07:57.320 --> 00:08:00.020 align:middle line:10%
Here's Aquarius right
there between Capricorn

00:08:00.020 --> 00:08:03.995 align:middle line:10%
and the fish over here,
and it's the water bearer.

00:08:03.995 --> 00:08:09.250 align:middle line:10%
I just wanted to give you
kind of an astronomical

00:08:09.250 --> 00:08:11.460 align:middle line:10%
view of Aquarius.

00:08:11.460 --> 00:08:16.040 align:middle line:10%
And here's the
chart for Ukraine,

00:08:16.040 --> 00:08:20.530 align:middle line:10%
which takes place on the 18th,
and this is Kiev 6:00 AM.

00:08:20.530 --> 00:08:23.890 align:middle line:84%
I like to start charts
early in the morning,

00:08:23.890 --> 00:08:26.470 align:middle line:84%
and so here we have
6:00 AM in Ukraine.

00:08:26.470 --> 00:08:29.260 align:middle line:84%
And what we have here, which
is, again, pretty interesting,

00:08:29.260 --> 00:08:33.580 align:middle line:84%
the start of the day, right, we
have, what's on the ascendant?

00:08:33.580 --> 00:08:34.830 align:middle line:90%
Aquarius.

00:08:34.830 --> 00:08:38.630 align:middle line:84%
And we have 0 degrees
on every point here.

00:08:38.630 --> 00:08:41.260 align:middle line:84%
These are all the fixed
angles of the chart.

00:08:41.260 --> 00:08:42.490 align:middle line:90%
Aquarius.

00:08:42.490 --> 00:08:45.970 align:middle line:84%
And down here we have Taurus,
and over here we have Leo,

00:08:45.970 --> 00:08:47.540 align:middle line:90%
and over here we have Scorpio.

00:08:47.540 --> 00:08:49.300 align:middle line:84%
So on the beginning,
the morning,

00:08:49.300 --> 00:08:51.040 align:middle line:84%
the dawn of the
new day when it all

00:08:51.040 --> 00:08:54.710 align:middle line:84%
started in Ukraine on
the 18th of February,

00:08:54.710 --> 00:08:56.050 align:middle line:90%
Aquarius is rising.

00:08:56.050 --> 00:08:57.770 align:middle line:90%
Aquarius is in the ascendant.

00:08:57.770 --> 00:09:01.030 align:middle line:84%
And when we have these 0 points
here, these are like portals.

00:09:01.030 --> 00:09:03.860 align:middle line:84%
The 0 degree is the
most potent degree

00:09:03.860 --> 00:09:05.540 align:middle line:90%
of any astrological sign.

00:09:05.540 --> 00:09:07.410 align:middle line:84%
The 29th degree is
the least potent.

00:09:07.410 --> 00:09:09.460 align:middle line:84%
The energy of the
sun is almost gone.

00:09:09.460 --> 00:09:13.400 align:middle line:84%
The 0 degree, the fullness
and the resonance of the sign

00:09:13.400 --> 00:09:15.040 align:middle line:90%
is complete.

00:09:15.040 --> 00:09:19.920 align:middle line:84%
It's complete, and it's newly
born with that 0 degree.

00:09:19.920 --> 00:09:23.100 align:middle line:84%
The 0 degrees, again,
represents everything.

00:09:23.100 --> 00:09:24.800 align:middle line:84%
It represents
everything and nothing.

00:09:24.800 --> 00:09:25.541 align:middle line:90%
It's a portal.

00:09:25.541 --> 00:09:28.040 align:middle line:84%
So what we have here-- let's
just kind of break some of this

00:09:28.040 --> 00:09:32.720 align:middle line:84%
down a little bit-- we have
the 29th degree of Aquarius.

00:09:32.720 --> 00:09:36.330 align:middle line:84%
To me, whenever we're
dealing with the 29th degree,

00:09:36.330 --> 00:09:39.370 align:middle line:84%
the anoretic degree, which
is, again, quite opposite

00:09:39.370 --> 00:09:40.190 align:middle line:90%
or in opposite.

00:09:40.190 --> 00:09:42.606 align:middle line:84%
It's not in opposition, but
it's very different than the 0

00:09:42.606 --> 00:09:44.360 align:middle line:84%
degree, it's a very
unstable degree.

00:09:44.360 --> 00:09:46.390 align:middle line:84%
There are endings
and beginnings.

00:09:46.390 --> 00:09:49.120 align:middle line:84%
The energy of the sign
is almost dissipated.

00:09:49.120 --> 00:09:54.344 align:middle line:84%
So by the time the revolution
finally kind of, you know,

00:09:54.344 --> 00:09:57.350 align:middle line:84%
ends, and we have this whatever
new provisional government

00:09:57.350 --> 00:09:59.640 align:middle line:84%
in Ukraine is, the
sun had already

00:09:59.640 --> 00:10:01.720 align:middle line:84%
moved into the early
degrees of Pisces.

00:10:01.720 --> 00:10:03.460 align:middle line:90%
But here it's an Aquarius.

00:10:03.460 --> 00:10:06.200 align:middle line:84%
We have Mercury in
Aquarius conjunct the sun,

00:10:06.200 --> 00:10:08.890 align:middle line:84%
and it gives the sun a
little bit more energy.

00:10:08.890 --> 00:10:10.180 align:middle line:90%
But it's squaring Saturn.

00:10:10.180 --> 00:10:12.350 align:middle line:84%
We're into the
Saturn square, which

00:10:12.350 --> 00:10:15.910 align:middle line:84%
makes this, in some ways--
the squares can be used

00:10:15.910 --> 00:10:19.670 align:middle line:84%
to build strength, but they
can also put a lot of stress

00:10:19.670 --> 00:10:21.700 align:middle line:90%
on any given situation.

00:10:21.700 --> 00:10:24.390 align:middle line:84%
So the Saturn sun
square would indicate

00:10:24.390 --> 00:10:27.460 align:middle line:84%
that, especially at the
29th degree of Aquarius,

00:10:27.460 --> 00:10:29.810 align:middle line:84%
that this is tenuous
at best, that there

00:10:29.810 --> 00:10:33.370 align:middle line:84%
may be some really strong
possibility with these 0

00:10:33.370 --> 00:10:35.370 align:middle line:84%
degrees, and
especially launching

00:10:35.370 --> 00:10:39.230 align:middle line:84%
this on the 18th in the
dawn of the new day.

00:10:39.230 --> 00:10:43.670 align:middle line:84%
However, this sun and
squaring Saturn in Scorpio

00:10:43.670 --> 00:10:44.795 align:middle line:90%
makes it challenging.

00:10:44.795 --> 00:10:48.530 align:middle line:84%
There's a-- the third
hexagram in the I Ching.

00:10:48.530 --> 00:10:50.670 align:middle line:84%
It's called difficulty
at the beginning.

00:10:50.670 --> 00:10:54.570 align:middle line:84%
That would apply to this chart,
especially with these degrees.

00:10:54.570 --> 00:10:55.970 align:middle line:84%
Now, what's also
interesting here

00:10:55.970 --> 00:10:59.140 align:middle line:84%
is we have Chiron and Neptune,
some of the Piscean energy

00:10:59.140 --> 00:11:02.280 align:middle line:84%
I'm talking about, in
the first house, which

00:11:02.280 --> 00:11:06.140 align:middle line:84%
means that there should be some
kind of spiritual vulnerability

00:11:06.140 --> 00:11:08.770 align:middle line:84%
that would be taking place
as part of this as well.

00:11:08.770 --> 00:11:11.450 align:middle line:84%
That obviously,
one of the things

00:11:11.450 --> 00:11:13.950 align:middle line:84%
that happens with
revolutions, especially

00:11:13.950 --> 00:11:15.990 align:middle line:84%
if they're marketed
correctly, is

00:11:15.990 --> 00:11:19.200 align:middle line:84%
that they can evoke
a sense of compassion

00:11:19.200 --> 00:11:20.630 align:middle line:90%
around people around the world.

00:11:20.630 --> 00:11:22.005 align:middle line:84%
And of course, we
had people that

00:11:22.005 --> 00:11:23.930 align:middle line:84%
were killed by shooters
in the Ukraine.

00:11:23.930 --> 00:11:28.460 align:middle line:84%
So that would open up this
sort of compassionate channel,

00:11:28.460 --> 00:11:30.820 align:middle line:84%
and then people would
say, hey, the Russians are

00:11:30.820 --> 00:11:32.830 align:middle line:90%
the bad guys or the thugs.

00:11:32.830 --> 00:11:34.640 align:middle line:84%
They're the ones that
probably did this,

00:11:34.640 --> 00:11:37.140 align:middle line:84%
in the case that may not
actually be the case.

00:11:37.140 --> 00:11:42.290 align:middle line:84%
However, Chiron and
Neptune evoke a type of-- I

00:11:42.290 --> 00:11:45.670 align:middle line:84%
don't want to say a victim
mentality, but I will say it.

00:11:45.670 --> 00:11:48.900 align:middle line:84%
It's a victim mentality here
with Chiron in the first house.

00:11:48.900 --> 00:11:50.320 align:middle line:90%
So we feel sorry.

00:11:50.320 --> 00:11:51.800 align:middle line:90%
We have a sense of compassion.

00:11:51.800 --> 00:11:53.280 align:middle line:90%
And it opens us up in some ways.

00:11:53.280 --> 00:11:57.150 align:middle line:84%
And if we look at this, right,
we look at the progression,

00:11:57.150 --> 00:11:59.990 align:middle line:84%
we open up to Chiron, which
is the spiritual suffering.

00:11:59.990 --> 00:12:02.530 align:middle line:84%
We open up to Neptune which
is right after Chiron, which

00:12:02.530 --> 00:12:04.520 align:middle line:84%
is the potential
spiritual redemption.

00:12:04.520 --> 00:12:07.240 align:middle line:84%
And that brings
us into Aquarius,

00:12:07.240 --> 00:12:10.220 align:middle line:84%
so we're more readily
able to accept

00:12:10.220 --> 00:12:12.230 align:middle line:84%
the Aquarian energies
that follow this.

00:12:12.230 --> 00:12:13.980 align:middle line:84%
So let's get into this
a little bit more.

00:12:13.980 --> 00:12:16.820 align:middle line:84%
What we also have here is
we have a massive cardinal

00:12:16.820 --> 00:12:17.749 align:middle line:90%
cross here.

00:12:17.749 --> 00:12:18.540 align:middle line:90%
Look at this cross.

00:12:18.540 --> 00:12:23.380 align:middle line:84%
We have Jupiter opposing Pluto
at 10 degrees, Pluto at 12,

00:12:23.380 --> 00:12:25.920 align:middle line:84%
and then we have Venus
also in Capricorn.

00:12:25.920 --> 00:12:29.467 align:middle line:84%
Now, whenever you see
planets in the twelfth house,

00:12:29.467 --> 00:12:31.550 align:middle line:84%
generally it means that
there's something going on

00:12:31.550 --> 00:12:33.350 align:middle line:90%
behind the scenes.

00:12:33.350 --> 00:12:34.465 align:middle line:90%
There are machinations.

00:12:34.465 --> 00:12:36.340 align:middle line:90%
There are relationships.

00:12:36.340 --> 00:12:37.350 align:middle line:90%
There's energy.

00:12:37.350 --> 00:12:38.200 align:middle line:90%
There's impetus.

00:12:38.200 --> 00:12:39.260 align:middle line:90%
There's motivation.

00:12:39.260 --> 00:12:40.340 align:middle line:90%
And you can't see it.

00:12:40.340 --> 00:12:42.530 align:middle line:84%
It's happening at a
pretty deep level, right?

00:12:42.530 --> 00:12:48.060 align:middle line:84%
Now, a few shows ago, I did a
comparative kind of analysis

00:12:48.060 --> 00:12:51.110 align:middle line:84%
on Russia's chart and
the United States' chart.

00:12:51.110 --> 00:12:53.410 align:middle line:84%
And when we looked at Russia's
chart, what did we see?

00:12:53.410 --> 00:12:56.710 align:middle line:84%
We saw a bunch of planets
in the sign of Capricorn.

00:12:56.710 --> 00:13:00.520 align:middle line:84%
I think Russia, when it
had its new constitution,

00:13:00.520 --> 00:13:03.160 align:middle line:84%
I think it had a stellium of
four planets in Capricorn.

00:13:03.160 --> 00:13:06.200 align:middle line:84%
And of course, the United
States is a Cancer country.

00:13:06.200 --> 00:13:07.260 align:middle line:90%
So what do we have here?

00:13:07.260 --> 00:13:09.860 align:middle line:84%
We have Jupiter and
Cancer squaring off

00:13:09.860 --> 00:13:12.270 align:middle line:84%
against Pluto and
Venus in Capricorn.

00:13:12.270 --> 00:13:14.420 align:middle line:84%
So essentially,
what we have, again,

00:13:14.420 --> 00:13:17.560 align:middle line:84%
using the astrological symbols
of the United States and Russia

00:13:17.560 --> 00:13:18.820 align:middle line:90%
in opposition.

00:13:18.820 --> 00:13:21.880 align:middle line:84%
And here, in the twelfth
house, it's hidden.

00:13:21.880 --> 00:13:25.370 align:middle line:84%
Russia's role behind all of
this, theoretically, is hidden.

00:13:25.370 --> 00:13:28.280 align:middle line:84%
But there's also
another aspect to this,

00:13:28.280 --> 00:13:30.040 align:middle line:84%
which we have to
take into account.

00:13:30.040 --> 00:13:33.510 align:middle line:84%
Pluto in Capricorn represents
the corporatocracy.

00:13:33.510 --> 00:13:34.090 align:middle line:90%
It happened.

00:13:34.090 --> 00:13:38.020 align:middle line:84%
It took place in 2009
to 2010 on the heels

00:13:38.020 --> 00:13:39.870 align:middle line:90%
of the banking crisis.

00:13:39.870 --> 00:13:43.080 align:middle line:84%
This is when the
corporatocracy came to power.

00:13:43.080 --> 00:13:46.150 align:middle line:84%
That's when the United States
government got more involved

00:13:46.150 --> 00:13:48.050 align:middle line:84%
in the concept of
business, and business

00:13:48.050 --> 00:13:50.260 align:middle line:90%
got more involved in government.

00:13:50.260 --> 00:13:54.640 align:middle line:84%
And so what we have here is
we have these forces colluding

00:13:54.640 --> 00:13:57.110 align:middle line:84%
together throughout
Pluto in Capricorn.

00:13:57.110 --> 00:13:58.912 align:middle line:90%
I've given the examples before.

00:13:58.912 --> 00:14:00.620 align:middle line:84%
I'll just give you
another example again.

00:14:00.620 --> 00:14:03.140 align:middle line:84%
Mike Taylor, who used
to work for Monsanto,

00:14:03.140 --> 00:14:05.720 align:middle line:84%
came over to the United
States, and now he's

00:14:05.720 --> 00:14:09.340 align:middle line:84%
working for the FDA and writing
the legislation and the Food

00:14:09.340 --> 00:14:10.870 align:middle line:90%
Safety Act for Monsanto.

00:14:10.870 --> 00:14:13.680 align:middle line:84%
This happens all the time, but
it's become much more prevalent

00:14:13.680 --> 00:14:15.280 align:middle line:84%
since Pluto's come
into Capricorn.

00:14:15.280 --> 00:14:18.860 align:middle line:84%
So what we have here in Pluto
in Capricorn at 12 degrees

00:14:18.860 --> 00:14:22.760 align:middle line:84%
and then Venus in Capricorn
at 15 degrees-- I'm sorry,

00:14:22.760 --> 00:14:28.500 align:middle line:84%
18 degrees, is the
relationship of the plutocracy

00:14:28.500 --> 00:14:33.160 align:middle line:84%
or this corporatocracy
as the hidden hand

00:14:33.160 --> 00:14:34.264 align:middle line:90%
in the twelfth house.

00:14:34.264 --> 00:14:35.430 align:middle line:90%
That's what this represents.

00:14:35.430 --> 00:14:37.970 align:middle line:84%
But there's also Russia
happening in here as well.

00:14:37.970 --> 00:14:41.150 align:middle line:84%
Now, what we also have is
we have the Moon in Libra.

00:14:41.150 --> 00:14:43.810 align:middle line:84%
Hey, if you're going to start
a new country and a revolution,

00:14:43.810 --> 00:14:45.660 align:middle line:84%
Moon in Libra is a
good place for the moon

00:14:45.660 --> 00:14:49.400 align:middle line:84%
to be because you want to
have some kind of equilibrium,

00:14:49.400 --> 00:14:52.570 align:middle line:84%
some kind of synergy,
some kind of mediation

00:14:52.570 --> 00:14:56.980 align:middle line:84%
balance between the right
and the left, democracy

00:14:56.980 --> 00:15:01.860 align:middle line:84%
and the rule of a leader, or
somebody who's been appointed

00:15:01.860 --> 00:15:05.120 align:middle line:84%
to run the country, or vote
it in, whatever that is,

00:15:05.120 --> 00:15:07.350 align:middle line:84%
Moon in Libra, not a
bad planet to have.

00:15:07.350 --> 00:15:08.150 align:middle line:90%
It's up here.

00:15:08.150 --> 00:15:09.320 align:middle line:90%
It's in the eighth house.

00:15:09.320 --> 00:15:11.820 align:middle line:84%
But again, it's behind
the scenes, right?

00:15:11.820 --> 00:15:14.700 align:middle line:84%
The eighth house represents
occluded material.

00:15:14.700 --> 00:15:17.730 align:middle line:84%
So not only do we have here
Pluto and Venus being occluded,

00:15:17.730 --> 00:15:21.420 align:middle line:84%
we also have the Moon and
Mars and the true node,

00:15:21.420 --> 00:15:23.510 align:middle line:90%
which is in 0 degrees Scorpio.

00:15:23.510 --> 00:15:26.460 align:middle line:84%
It's going backwards
towards Libra.

00:15:26.460 --> 00:15:28.970 align:middle line:84%
So that's, again, it's all
taking place behind the scenes,

00:15:28.970 --> 00:15:31.220 align:middle line:84%
underneath the
surface of things.

00:15:31.220 --> 00:15:33.580 align:middle line:84%
So there's lots of stuff
happening with the Ukraine,

00:15:33.580 --> 00:15:36.000 align:middle line:84%
or Ukraine-- we don't use
"the" anymore-- that we

00:15:36.000 --> 00:15:38.670 align:middle line:84%
don't necessarily
understand or know about.

00:15:38.670 --> 00:15:42.500 align:middle line:84%
Generally speaking, when we
see Libra here in the eighth,

00:15:42.500 --> 00:15:45.560 align:middle line:84%
and when we see Venus,
which rules Libra, over here

00:15:45.560 --> 00:15:48.430 align:middle line:84%
in the twelfth, there are
deals being made, because Libra

00:15:48.430 --> 00:15:51.180 align:middle line:84%
represents negotiations,
right, mediation.

00:15:51.180 --> 00:15:52.960 align:middle line:84%
And when it's happening
all in the eighth

00:15:52.960 --> 00:15:54.452 align:middle line:84%
and the twelfth
house, it's hidden.

00:15:54.452 --> 00:15:55.410 align:middle line:90%
It's behind the scenes.

00:15:55.410 --> 00:15:57.480 align:middle line:84%
Now, the Moon is
opposing Uranus.

00:15:57.480 --> 00:16:01.530 align:middle line:84%
But when Uranus is in the second
house here, very unstable.

00:16:01.530 --> 00:16:03.470 align:middle line:84%
The second house is
the House of Values.

00:16:03.470 --> 00:16:04.540 align:middle line:90%
It's Taurus.

00:16:04.540 --> 00:16:05.690 align:middle line:90%
It's fixity.

00:16:05.690 --> 00:16:08.080 align:middle line:90%
Its being really super-grounded.

00:16:08.080 --> 00:16:11.200 align:middle line:84%
It's really basic stuff,
right, the second house.

00:16:11.200 --> 00:16:12.480 align:middle line:90%
You know, it's the foundation.

00:16:12.480 --> 00:16:15.690 align:middle line:84%
If you want to build a
foundation for a revolution--

00:16:15.690 --> 00:16:17.990 align:middle line:84%
and again, this is at 6
o'clock in the morning,

00:16:17.990 --> 00:16:19.830 align:middle line:84%
so I'm using the
start of the day,

00:16:19.830 --> 00:16:22.190 align:middle line:84%
this is when it's all
happening, all taking place,

00:16:22.190 --> 00:16:25.017 align:middle line:84%
crack of dawn in Ukraine--
this is not a great planet

00:16:25.017 --> 00:16:27.100 align:middle line:84%
to have in the second house
because it's unstable.

00:16:27.100 --> 00:16:28.740 align:middle line:90%
Uranus is an unstable planet.

00:16:28.740 --> 00:16:30.070 align:middle line:90%
And it's Aries, right?

00:16:30.070 --> 00:16:32.920 align:middle line:84%
So here we have
the energy of war,

00:16:32.920 --> 00:16:35.670 align:middle line:84%
which is Aries, Uranus,
the energy of revolution,

00:16:35.670 --> 00:16:38.560 align:middle line:84%
in the second house, and it's
opposing the Moon in Libra.

00:16:38.560 --> 00:16:43.160 align:middle line:84%
So you know, the potential
for a peaceful resolution,

00:16:43.160 --> 00:16:45.237 align:middle line:84%
which would be Moon in
Libra, is occluded here

00:16:45.237 --> 00:16:46.070 align:middle line:90%
in the eighth house.

00:16:46.070 --> 00:16:48.780 align:middle line:84%
And what we're getting is we're
getting this Uranian energy

00:16:48.780 --> 00:16:50.787 align:middle line:84%
in the second, which
is incredibly unstable.

00:16:50.787 --> 00:16:52.370 align:middle line:84%
Now, there's some
interesting energies

00:16:52.370 --> 00:16:55.740 align:middle line:84%
between Mars, which is at
the end degree of Libra, 26.

00:16:55.740 --> 00:16:57.980 align:middle line:84%
It's going reverse
now, retrograde.

00:16:57.980 --> 00:17:02.460 align:middle line:84%
But it is trining the Sun,
and it is trining Mercury.

00:17:02.460 --> 00:17:04.244 align:middle line:84%
So what we'll have
here is we'll have

00:17:04.244 --> 00:17:07.420 align:middle line:84%
some sympathetic energy
coming from Mars, which

00:17:07.420 --> 00:17:10.040 align:middle line:84%
is all about
equality, and liberte,

00:17:10.040 --> 00:17:12.504 align:middle line:84%
and these very kind of
democratic and revolutionary

00:17:12.504 --> 00:17:13.530 align:middle line:90%
ideals.

00:17:13.530 --> 00:17:18.040 align:middle line:84%
So it is feeding into the
conjunction of Mercury

00:17:18.040 --> 00:17:19.710 align:middle line:90%
and the Sun in Aquarius.

00:17:19.710 --> 00:17:22.099 align:middle line:84%
So there's some energy
here supporting this.

00:17:22.099 --> 00:17:23.270 align:middle line:90%
But again, it's hidden.

00:17:23.270 --> 00:17:24.670 align:middle line:90%
It's behind the scenes.

00:17:24.670 --> 00:17:25.342 align:middle line:90%
Who is it?

00:17:25.342 --> 00:17:27.160 align:middle line:84%
Who are the players
behind the scenes?

00:17:27.160 --> 00:17:28.942 align:middle line:84%
What's driving this
revolution, or who's

00:17:28.942 --> 00:17:29.900 align:middle line:90%
driving the revolution?

00:17:29.900 --> 00:17:32.080 align:middle line:90%
Well, let's check this out.

00:17:32.080 --> 00:17:33.140 align:middle line:90%
This is Srdja Popovic.

00:17:33.140 --> 00:17:36.710 align:middle line:90%
He is-- Look at those eyes.

00:17:36.710 --> 00:17:40.210 align:middle line:84%
Don't stare at it too long,
you might get possessed.

00:17:40.210 --> 00:17:44.075 align:middle line:84%
So Srdja Popovic, he
is the head of Otpor!,

00:17:44.075 --> 00:17:49.860 align:middle line:84%
and he's also the head of
CANVAS, C-A-N-V-A-S. And Otpor!

00:17:49.860 --> 00:17:57.310 align:middle line:84%
was the group that basically
ousted Milosevic in Serbia.

00:17:57.310 --> 00:17:58.430 align:middle line:90%
And Otpor!

00:17:58.430 --> 00:18:03.044 align:middle line:84%
created the manual
for revolutions.

00:18:03.044 --> 00:18:04.460 align:middle line:84%
They've got all
these touchpoints,

00:18:04.460 --> 00:18:08.910 align:middle line:84%
and they've got all these
activities and exercises.

00:18:08.910 --> 00:18:13.040 align:middle line:84%
They're kind of like
the European version

00:18:13.040 --> 00:18:16.750 align:middle line:84%
of Saul Alinsky's community
organizing and Rules

00:18:16.750 --> 00:18:17.780 align:middle line:90%
for Radicals.

00:18:17.780 --> 00:18:21.840 align:middle line:84%
Now, Otpor! and Popovic,
they've taken their lead

00:18:21.840 --> 00:18:24.510 align:middle line:84%
from Gene Sharp, who I've
talked about before on the show

00:18:24.510 --> 00:18:25.340 align:middle line:90%
as well.

00:18:25.340 --> 00:18:27.660 align:middle line:84%
Gene Sharp happens
to be an Aquarius,

00:18:27.660 --> 00:18:33.455 align:middle line:84%
and he's kind of the father,
the dean of revolution

00:18:33.455 --> 00:18:35.170 align:middle line:90%
on the planet right now.

00:18:35.170 --> 00:18:38.000 align:middle line:84%
And he, of course, is the head
of the Einstein Institute,

00:18:38.000 --> 00:18:40.840 align:middle line:84%
which gets into non-violent
confrontation and things

00:18:40.840 --> 00:18:41.780 align:middle line:90%
like this.

00:18:41.780 --> 00:18:42.560 align:middle line:90%
So Otpor!

00:18:42.560 --> 00:18:44.210 align:middle line:90%
created the manual.

00:18:44.210 --> 00:18:47.710 align:middle line:84%
They created the template
when they ousted Milosevic.

00:18:47.710 --> 00:18:48.720 align:middle line:90%
And Otpor!

00:18:48.720 --> 00:18:52.170 align:middle line:84%
was brought in to the
color revolutions as well.

00:18:52.170 --> 00:18:54.110 align:middle line:84%
CANVAS, they're
CANVAS now, they were

00:18:54.110 --> 00:18:56.310 align:middle line:84%
brought into the color
revolutions as well.

00:18:56.310 --> 00:18:58.640 align:middle line:84%
And if you look at what
happened with Ukraine,

00:18:58.640 --> 00:19:03.880 align:middle line:84%
and if you look at what
happened with Libya and Yemen,

00:19:03.880 --> 00:19:09.020 align:middle line:84%
and particularly Egypt, almost
point for point for point,

00:19:09.020 --> 00:19:14.500 align:middle line:84%
the blueprint of the revolution
matches each of those events.

00:19:14.500 --> 00:19:18.160 align:middle line:84%
And they line up with the
touchpoints and the principles

00:19:18.160 --> 00:19:20.440 align:middle line:84%
of leading a revolution,
staging a revolution

00:19:20.440 --> 00:19:22.730 align:middle line:84%
that Otpor! and
CANVAS have put out.

00:19:22.730 --> 00:19:25.102 align:middle line:90%
Now, what is Srdja Popovic?

00:19:25.102 --> 00:19:25.810 align:middle line:90%
Well, guess what?

00:19:25.810 --> 00:19:26.650 align:middle line:90%
He's an Aquarius.

00:19:26.650 --> 00:19:27.460 align:middle line:90%
There we go.

00:19:27.460 --> 00:19:31.620 align:middle line:84%
There's Aquarius again
coming to our consciousness

00:19:31.620 --> 00:19:33.590 align:middle line:90%
as it relates to revolution.

00:19:33.590 --> 00:19:35.440 align:middle line:84%
What's interesting
about Popovic's chart

00:19:35.440 --> 00:19:37.070 align:middle line:84%
is that there's no
water in the chart.

00:19:37.070 --> 00:19:37.550 align:middle line:90%
You see that?

00:19:37.550 --> 00:19:38.258 align:middle line:90%
There's no water.

00:19:38.258 --> 00:19:39.400 align:middle line:90%
It's all air.

00:19:39.400 --> 00:19:40.185 align:middle line:90%
It's all fire.

00:19:40.185 --> 00:19:42.280 align:middle line:90%
And it's got some earth.

00:19:42.280 --> 00:19:43.930 align:middle line:90%
It's all ideology.

00:19:43.930 --> 00:19:45.370 align:middle line:90%
It's ideology.

00:19:45.370 --> 00:19:48.940 align:middle line:84%
And we have 25 degrees
Capricorn Venus, right?

00:19:48.940 --> 00:19:50.960 align:middle line:84%
If you go back, go
back, back, back,

00:19:50.960 --> 00:19:54.800 align:middle line:84%
let's go back in
time, boom, boom.

00:19:54.800 --> 00:19:56.010 align:middle line:90%
Where's Capricorn over here?

00:19:56.010 --> 00:19:57.420 align:middle line:90%
It's in the twelfth house.

00:19:57.420 --> 00:20:02.100 align:middle line:84%
So Venus at 25 degrees would
be over here, again hidden

00:20:02.100 --> 00:20:03.520 align:middle line:90%
in the twelfth house.

00:20:03.520 --> 00:20:07.250 align:middle line:84%
And Popovic, his
Venus would be here

00:20:07.250 --> 00:20:08.850 align:middle line:84%
in that hidden and
occluded house.

00:20:08.850 --> 00:20:10.200 align:middle line:90%
It's kind of interesting.

00:20:10.200 --> 00:20:12.655 align:middle line:84%
So he has Venus at
25 degrees, and he

00:20:12.655 --> 00:20:14.920 align:middle line:90%
has the Moon at 20 degrees.

00:20:14.920 --> 00:20:18.270 align:middle line:84%
And whenever we have
Venus or the Moon

00:20:18.270 --> 00:20:22.920 align:middle line:84%
in Capricorn, what it means is
is that the individual-- forget

00:20:22.920 --> 00:20:25.790 align:middle line:84%
it's Popovic-- but
the individual alone

00:20:25.790 --> 00:20:29.850 align:middle line:84%
has the capacity to tap into
hierarchical structures.

00:20:29.850 --> 00:20:31.350 align:middle line:84%
From an emotional
standpoint, that's

00:20:31.350 --> 00:20:35.580 align:middle line:84%
the Moon and from a Venusian
or a relationship standpoint.

00:20:35.580 --> 00:20:39.150 align:middle line:84%
So they can actually
bond, work within

00:20:39.150 --> 00:20:40.760 align:middle line:90%
a hierarchical structure.

00:20:40.760 --> 00:20:44.160 align:middle line:84%
They can work within a corporate
structure or a group structure.

00:20:44.160 --> 00:20:46.000 align:middle line:84%
But not only that,
but they would

00:20:46.000 --> 00:20:49.730 align:middle line:84%
be attracted to people that had
a significant amount of power

00:20:49.730 --> 00:20:51.700 align:middle line:90%
and/or resources.

00:20:51.700 --> 00:20:54.280 align:middle line:84%
One of the things that
came out with Popovic

00:20:54.280 --> 00:20:58.210 align:middle line:84%
is that he and Stratfor, the
group that gathers intelligence

00:20:58.210 --> 00:20:59.910 align:middle line:84%
in Austin for many
parts of the world,

00:20:59.910 --> 00:21:01.300 align:middle line:90%
have a very unique relationship.

00:21:01.300 --> 00:21:05.080 align:middle line:84%
This came out through the
WikiLeaks cables releases.

00:21:05.080 --> 00:21:09.140 align:middle line:84%
He also has a very strong
relationship with George Soros

00:21:09.140 --> 00:21:10.210 align:middle line:90%
as well.

00:21:10.210 --> 00:21:12.720 align:middle line:84%
So here we have,
in his chart now,

00:21:12.720 --> 00:21:14.520 align:middle line:84%
I don't have a time
for him being born,

00:21:14.520 --> 00:21:17.810 align:middle line:84%
but you can see here the
aggregation of Aquarius

00:21:17.810 --> 00:21:19.840 align:middle line:90%
on the Sun and Aquarius Mercury.

00:21:19.840 --> 00:21:22.120 align:middle line:84%
So he is revolutionary
in spirit.

00:21:22.120 --> 00:21:24.890 align:middle line:84%
He has actually a really
interesting grand trine

00:21:24.890 --> 00:21:27.750 align:middle line:84%
with Saturn here in
Gemini, Pluto in Libra,

00:21:27.750 --> 00:21:30.790 align:middle line:84%
and the Sun and
Mercury in Aquarius.

00:21:30.790 --> 00:21:32.220 align:middle line:84%
This guy was built
for revolution.

00:21:32.220 --> 00:21:34.540 align:middle line:84%
This is the chart
of a revolutionary.

00:21:34.540 --> 00:21:36.670 align:middle line:84%
And water, the lack
of water-- no water

00:21:36.670 --> 00:21:41.040 align:middle line:84%
means that there's very little
potential for compassion

00:21:41.040 --> 00:21:44.640 align:middle line:90%
and emotional capacity.

00:21:44.640 --> 00:21:48.010 align:middle line:84%
The emotional reservoir here
is completely tapped and dry.

00:21:48.010 --> 00:21:51.000 align:middle line:84%
However, there's a
great deal of energy

00:21:51.000 --> 00:21:54.540 align:middle line:84%
here with ideology, with all
the air in the chart as well.

00:21:54.540 --> 00:21:55.040 align:middle line:90%
All right.

00:21:55.040 --> 00:21:57.440 align:middle line:84%
So let's move on to the
next sign, or the next.

00:21:57.440 --> 00:21:58.390 align:middle line:90%
Ah, here we go.

00:21:58.390 --> 00:22:01.250 align:middle line:84%
So, now keep in mind that
Popovic is from where?

00:22:01.250 --> 00:22:01.980 align:middle line:90%
Serbia.

00:22:01.980 --> 00:22:02.480 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:22:02.480 --> 00:22:03.450 align:middle line:90%
He's from Serbia.

00:22:03.450 --> 00:22:07.150 align:middle line:84%
And he's basically been leading
these revolutions, especially

00:22:07.150 --> 00:22:08.910 align:middle line:84%
in North Africa and
the Middle East,

00:22:08.910 --> 00:22:10.410 align:middle line:84%
and now they're
kind of coming home.

00:22:10.410 --> 00:22:12.130 align:middle line:90%
They're coming to Ukraine.

00:22:12.130 --> 00:22:14.510 align:middle line:90%
Now, who is this guy?

00:22:14.510 --> 00:22:19.760 align:middle line:84%
This man is named Gavrilo
Principa or Princip,

00:22:19.760 --> 00:22:22.380 align:middle line:84%
Gavrilo Princip, not
Principa, Princip.

00:22:22.380 --> 00:22:26.050 align:middle line:84%
Gavrilo Princip is
generally regarded

00:22:26.050 --> 00:22:31.140 align:middle line:84%
as one of the all-time losers
on the history of the Earth.

00:22:31.140 --> 00:22:31.920 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:22:31.920 --> 00:22:34.480 align:middle line:84%
His story is is
that he is Serbian,

00:22:34.480 --> 00:22:37.680 align:middle line:84%
and he was around during
the time of the Hapsburg

00:22:37.680 --> 00:22:39.980 align:middle line:84%
dynasty and Archduke
Bishop Ferdinand.

00:22:39.980 --> 00:22:42.660 align:middle line:84%
And he was such a loser
that he was rejected

00:22:42.660 --> 00:22:44.760 align:middle line:84%
by a number of
revolutionary groups

00:22:44.760 --> 00:22:46.160 align:middle line:90%
who were around at that time.

00:22:46.160 --> 00:22:48.632 align:middle line:84%
He was finally
picked up by the-- I

00:22:48.632 --> 00:22:50.840 align:middle line:84%
guess it would be like the
lowest of the minor league

00:22:50.840 --> 00:22:52.961 align:middle line:84%
revolutionary groups
happening in Serbia.

00:22:52.961 --> 00:22:54.960 align:middle line:84%
I guess he was a Class A
revolutionary or rookie

00:22:54.960 --> 00:22:56.410 align:middle line:90%
league, something like that.

00:22:56.410 --> 00:22:59.590 align:middle line:84%
So he was assigned,
at one point,

00:22:59.590 --> 00:23:02.530 align:middle line:84%
to be part of this group,
part of this detail that

00:23:02.530 --> 00:23:05.530 align:middle line:84%
was going to kill
Archbishop Duke Ferdinand.

00:23:05.530 --> 00:23:07.770 align:middle line:84%
And Archbishop
Duke Ferdinand was

00:23:07.770 --> 00:23:12.660 align:middle line:84%
a fairly lenient-- at that time,
it was the House of Hapsburg

00:23:12.660 --> 00:23:17.140 align:middle line:84%
sort of ruling this area from
the eastern part of Germany,

00:23:17.140 --> 00:23:19.000 align:middle line:84%
part of the
Alsace-Lorraine region

00:23:19.000 --> 00:23:22.250 align:middle line:84%
in France, part of
Poland, coming down

00:23:22.250 --> 00:23:25.600 align:middle line:84%
into the Austria-Hungarian
region, and of course Serbia.

00:23:25.600 --> 00:23:29.620 align:middle line:84%
And he was actually a
fairly benevolent leader.

00:23:29.620 --> 00:23:32.200 align:middle line:84%
In fact, a case could
be made that, based

00:23:32.200 --> 00:23:35.050 align:middle line:84%
on what happened to him,
that despotism might actually

00:23:35.050 --> 00:23:39.300 align:middle line:84%
be a viable strategy
when it comes

00:23:39.300 --> 00:23:43.320 align:middle line:84%
to ruling people and
their systems in society.

00:23:43.320 --> 00:23:45.020 align:middle line:84%
Actually I'm kidding
here, of course.

00:23:45.020 --> 00:23:48.120 align:middle line:84%
But he was pretty lenient, and
as a result of his leniency,

00:23:48.120 --> 00:23:50.750 align:middle line:84%
there were a number of groups,
a number of radical group

00:23:50.750 --> 00:23:52.110 align:middle line:90%
that emerged.

00:23:52.110 --> 00:23:57.080 align:middle line:84%
And this group that Princip
was a part of was one of them.

00:23:57.080 --> 00:24:02.400 align:middle line:84%
Now, Prince Hapsburg, or
Archduke Bishop Ferdinand, not

00:24:02.400 --> 00:24:05.940 align:middle line:84%
Prince Hapsburg,
he went to Sarajevo

00:24:05.940 --> 00:24:06.990 align:middle line:90%
for a number of reasons.

00:24:06.990 --> 00:24:07.900 align:middle line:90%
He traveled by car.

00:24:07.900 --> 00:24:10.220 align:middle line:84%
And one of the reasons
why he traveled by car

00:24:10.220 --> 00:24:12.760 align:middle line:84%
was because he wanted to
bring his wife Sophie--

00:24:12.760 --> 00:24:16.670 align:middle line:84%
his wife Sophie was not
from the royal bloodline.

00:24:16.670 --> 00:24:18.950 align:middle line:84%
She was a quote
unquote, "commoner."

00:24:18.950 --> 00:24:20.920 align:middle line:84%
And one of the
deals that he made

00:24:20.920 --> 00:24:23.460 align:middle line:84%
to have for her as his
wife was that he could not

00:24:23.460 --> 00:24:25.600 align:middle line:90%
show her in public in Austria.

00:24:25.600 --> 00:24:27.690 align:middle line:84%
So he actually took
her to Sarajevo

00:24:27.690 --> 00:24:31.200 align:middle line:84%
so he could show her off
in this open-air car.

00:24:31.200 --> 00:24:33.260 align:middle line:84%
And while they were
driving to Sarajevo,

00:24:33.260 --> 00:24:35.230 align:middle line:84%
they were actually shot
at a number of times.

00:24:35.230 --> 00:24:39.410 align:middle line:84%
And some of the men who were
guards on his car, standing

00:24:39.410 --> 00:24:41.560 align:middle line:84%
on the runners, were
actually killed.

00:24:41.560 --> 00:24:43.282 align:middle line:90%
So they went to Sarajevo.

00:24:43.282 --> 00:24:44.740 align:middle line:84%
They had their
meeting in Sarajevo.

00:24:44.740 --> 00:24:48.150 align:middle line:84%
And things started to get very
heavy, so they had to leave.

00:24:48.150 --> 00:24:52.560 align:middle line:84%
And on their way back to
Austria, they missed a turn,

00:24:52.560 --> 00:24:54.160 align:middle line:90%
and they had to back the car up.

00:24:54.160 --> 00:24:59.020 align:middle line:84%
This guy, Princip,
was standing outside

00:24:59.020 --> 00:25:01.590 align:middle line:84%
of a restaurant
eating a sandwich.

00:25:01.590 --> 00:25:05.810 align:middle line:84%
And he noticed that the car
had Archduke Bishop Ferdinand

00:25:05.810 --> 00:25:07.560 align:middle line:90%
inside the car with his wife.

00:25:07.560 --> 00:25:10.200 align:middle line:84%
And he ran up to the
car, and he shot them,

00:25:10.200 --> 00:25:12.850 align:middle line:84%
and he killed his
wife who was pregnant,

00:25:12.850 --> 00:25:17.050 align:middle line:84%
and then killed Archduke
Bishop Ferdinand as well.

00:25:17.050 --> 00:25:20.065 align:middle line:84%
And as a result of
this, what did we have?

00:25:20.065 --> 00:25:25.440 align:middle line:84%
We had the start of the World
War I. Now, Archduke Ferdinand,

00:25:25.440 --> 00:25:28.780 align:middle line:90%
he was killed on June 28, 1914.

00:25:28.780 --> 00:25:33.540 align:middle line:84%
So we are coming up on the
100th anniversary of his death.

00:25:33.540 --> 00:25:38.950 align:middle line:84%
A month later, July 28,
1914, World War I starts.

00:25:38.950 --> 00:25:41.830 align:middle line:84%
So here we are, we're in a
100-year cycle with World War

00:25:41.830 --> 00:25:46.720 align:middle line:84%
I. And you know, World
War I, in many ways,

00:25:46.720 --> 00:25:49.950 align:middle line:84%
kicked off the 20th
century and determined

00:25:49.950 --> 00:25:52.660 align:middle line:84%
sort of the energy
and the vibration

00:25:52.660 --> 00:25:56.055 align:middle line:84%
and the geopolitical
outcomes of the 20th century.

00:25:56.055 --> 00:25:58.090 align:middle line:84%
We're going to chart
how that happens.

00:25:58.090 --> 00:26:00.040 align:middle line:84%
And here we are a
hundred years later,

00:26:00.040 --> 00:26:03.260 align:middle line:84%
and we're on the precipice
of a new 100-year cycle.

00:26:03.260 --> 00:26:05.840 align:middle line:84%
And it's happening right
around the same region,

00:26:05.840 --> 00:26:09.820 align:middle line:84%
in the same part of the world
that it happened in 1914.

00:26:09.820 --> 00:26:13.880 align:middle line:84%
And you also have two characters
who are both of Serbian descent

00:26:13.880 --> 00:26:16.410 align:middle line:84%
playing roles in what's
manifesting and unfolding

00:26:16.410 --> 00:26:18.000 align:middle line:90%
there.

00:26:18.000 --> 00:26:20.160 align:middle line:84%
So this is the
chart for World War

00:26:20.160 --> 00:26:22.090 align:middle line:84%
I. I just decided
to bring this up.

00:26:22.090 --> 00:26:25.230 align:middle line:84%
This is for Vienna,
Austria 7:30 AM.

00:26:25.230 --> 00:26:27.320 align:middle line:84%
And here we have Virgo
on the ascendant,

00:26:27.320 --> 00:26:29.880 align:middle line:84%
and we have, again, a
very strong eleventh

00:26:29.880 --> 00:26:32.870 align:middle line:90%
house: Sun, Neptune, Mercury.

00:26:32.870 --> 00:26:37.360 align:middle line:84%
So we see a recasting
of, in some ways,

00:26:37.360 --> 00:26:40.030 align:middle line:84%
the entire portion
of Western and parts

00:26:40.030 --> 00:26:43.240 align:middle line:84%
of Eastern Europe as
part of this chart.

00:26:43.240 --> 00:26:46.520 align:middle line:84%
And again, we have the eleventh
house with the emphasis,

00:26:46.520 --> 00:26:50.090 align:middle line:84%
so we're looking at
Aquarius coming through.

00:26:50.090 --> 00:26:52.960 align:middle line:84%
Now, here we have
Mercury in Cancer.

00:26:52.960 --> 00:26:54.770 align:middle line:90%
The Sun is at four degrees Leo.

00:26:54.770 --> 00:26:57.890 align:middle line:84%
The United States would
eventually enter into this war,

00:26:57.890 --> 00:26:59.445 align:middle line:84%
and it would be the
Cancerian agent.

00:26:59.445 --> 00:27:01.720 align:middle line:84%
We have Pluto at
1 degree Cancer.

00:27:01.720 --> 00:27:04.210 align:middle line:84%
And then between the
space of Pluto and Mercury

00:27:04.210 --> 00:27:06.330 align:middle line:84%
is where a number of the
United States' planets--

00:27:06.330 --> 00:27:08.790 align:middle line:84%
and in fact, I believe the
United States' Sun is conjunct

00:27:08.790 --> 00:27:11.840 align:middle line:84%
Mercury here in
the eleventh house.

00:27:11.840 --> 00:27:13.230 align:middle line:90%
It's an interesting chart.

00:27:13.230 --> 00:27:16.550 align:middle line:84%
We have Moon here in
Libra at 11 degrees.

00:27:16.550 --> 00:27:20.790 align:middle line:84%
Where did we see the Moon
with the Ukrainian Revolution?

00:27:20.790 --> 00:27:23.600 align:middle line:84%
It was in the sign of Libra, and
here it's in the second house.

00:27:23.600 --> 00:27:25.476 align:middle line:84%
And in the chart that
we looked at before,

00:27:25.476 --> 00:27:26.850 align:middle line:84%
the Moon was in
the eighth house.

00:27:26.850 --> 00:27:29.410 align:middle line:84%
So the Moon is playing a
role in both of these charts

00:27:29.410 --> 00:27:31.790 align:middle line:84%
and in the sign
of Libra as well.

00:27:31.790 --> 00:27:34.130 align:middle line:84%
We go to the true node
here, and oh, guess what?

00:27:34.130 --> 00:27:37.655 align:middle line:84%
There's Chiron in
Pisces 15 degrees.

00:27:37.655 --> 00:27:39.260 align:middle line:84%
If we go back to
the other chart,

00:27:39.260 --> 00:27:41.590 align:middle line:84%
we'll see Chiron
again in Pisces.

00:27:41.590 --> 00:27:44.370 align:middle line:84%
In this case, Chiron
was in the first house.

00:27:44.370 --> 00:27:47.240 align:middle line:84%
Here with World War I, Chiron
is in the seventh house,

00:27:47.240 --> 00:27:49.360 align:middle line:84%
which is the house
of relationships.

00:27:49.360 --> 00:27:51.990 align:middle line:84%
So we could look at
this from an aspect

00:27:51.990 --> 00:27:54.760 align:middle line:84%
that there would be a
number of relationships

00:27:54.760 --> 00:27:55.920 align:middle line:90%
that would come into play.

00:27:55.920 --> 00:27:59.010 align:middle line:84%
We would have the alliance
of the-- the beginning

00:27:59.010 --> 00:28:02.130 align:middle line:84%
of the alliance of Great
Britain, and United

00:28:02.130 --> 00:28:06.780 align:middle line:84%
States, and France, and
even Russia to some extent,

00:28:06.780 --> 00:28:09.450 align:middle line:84%
all congregating here
in the seventh house.

00:28:09.450 --> 00:28:12.430 align:middle line:84%
But with Pisces, what you
have to watch out for,

00:28:12.430 --> 00:28:14.465 align:middle line:84%
again, is the
motivation, and you

00:28:14.465 --> 00:28:18.340 align:middle line:84%
would have to watch out for
the sense of either compassion,

00:28:18.340 --> 00:28:20.970 align:middle line:84%
victimization, delusion,
illusion, all the things we

00:28:20.970 --> 00:28:21.880 align:middle line:90%
know about Pisces.

00:28:21.880 --> 00:28:24.880 align:middle line:84%
But here it is, Chiron
again in Pisces,

00:28:24.880 --> 00:28:28.340 align:middle line:84%
so we're revisiting Chiron as it
relates to the first World War

00:28:28.340 --> 00:28:31.510 align:middle line:90%
and what's happening in Ukraine.

00:28:31.510 --> 00:28:34.350 align:middle line:84%
We have Jupiter over here in
Aquarius in the sixth house.

00:28:34.350 --> 00:28:37.260 align:middle line:84%
So we have another
Aquarian imprimatur,

00:28:37.260 --> 00:28:40.470 align:middle line:84%
and of course, Uranus
in the sign of Aquarius.

00:28:40.470 --> 00:28:42.140 align:middle line:90%
It's opposing this Leo sun.

00:28:42.140 --> 00:28:45.810 align:middle line:84%
The Leo sun would be, in
some ways, the remnants

00:28:45.810 --> 00:28:48.440 align:middle line:90%
of the Hapsburg dynasty, right?

00:28:48.440 --> 00:28:53.310 align:middle line:84%
This is when Europe was still
being ruled kind of overtly

00:28:53.310 --> 00:28:56.440 align:middle line:84%
by the houses of royal
families' bloodlines.

00:28:56.440 --> 00:28:59.250 align:middle line:84%
And here we have Uranus
opposing the sun.

00:28:59.250 --> 00:29:02.190 align:middle line:84%
This is the energy of revolution
taking place right here.

00:29:02.190 --> 00:29:04.646 align:middle line:10%
So it's an interesting
chart, and there

00:29:04.646 --> 00:29:07.020 align:middle line:10%
are some things that connect
us back into what we've just

00:29:07.020 --> 00:29:09.800 align:middle line:10%
been seeing with Ukraine.

00:29:09.800 --> 00:29:12.860 align:middle line:10%
Now, this is the
Treaty of Versailles.

00:29:12.860 --> 00:29:15.300 align:middle line:84%
And of course, the Germans
are brought into World War

00:29:15.300 --> 00:29:20.430 align:middle line:84%
I via Otto von Bismarck, and the
Germans will lose World War I.

00:29:20.430 --> 00:29:23.340 align:middle line:84%
And as a result,
there are reparations

00:29:23.340 --> 00:29:25.620 align:middle line:84%
that are placed on
the German government.

00:29:25.620 --> 00:29:27.440 align:middle line:84%
There are very
strong sanctions that

00:29:27.440 --> 00:29:29.069 align:middle line:84%
are placed upon the
German government,

00:29:29.069 --> 00:29:30.610 align:middle line:84%
and the German
government is actually

00:29:30.610 --> 00:29:33.210 align:middle line:90%
bankrupted as a result of this.

00:29:33.210 --> 00:29:37.150 align:middle line:84%
And the physical and
the economic bankruptcy

00:29:37.150 --> 00:29:39.607 align:middle line:84%
results in something
that we'll see.

00:29:39.607 --> 00:29:41.356 align:middle line:84%
Here we have-- these
are the top hats that

00:29:41.356 --> 00:29:42.689 align:middle line:90%
are at the Treaty of Versailles.

00:29:42.689 --> 00:29:45.560 align:middle line:90%
There's Woodrow Wilson.

00:29:45.560 --> 00:29:47.590 align:middle line:84%
And he's there,
he's hanging out.

00:29:47.590 --> 00:29:54.330 align:middle line:84%
And the top hats generally
represent the Illuminati.

00:29:54.330 --> 00:29:58.057 align:middle line:84%
This is what-- this is what
they-- the attire, supposedly,

00:29:58.057 --> 00:30:00.530 align:middle line:84%
of the Illuminati
is the top that.

00:30:00.530 --> 00:30:01.930 align:middle line:90%
It's a Free Masonic attire.

00:30:01.930 --> 00:30:04.420 align:middle line:10%
So here we have the
top hats in full force

00:30:04.420 --> 00:30:06.140 align:middle line:10%
at the Treaty of Versailles.

00:30:06.140 --> 00:30:08.850 align:middle line:10%
Now, as a result of the
Treaty of Versailles,

00:30:08.850 --> 00:30:13.770 align:middle line:10%
again, Germany becomes both
economically and spiritually

00:30:13.770 --> 00:30:16.105 align:middle line:10%
and emotionally and
morally kind of bankrupt,

00:30:16.105 --> 00:30:19.610 align:middle line:10%
and we have the rise
of the Weimar Republic.

00:30:19.610 --> 00:30:23.470 align:middle line:10%
And part of the Weimar
Republic, or part of the Weimar

00:30:23.470 --> 00:30:27.450 align:middle line:10%
tradition, sort of
descends into this sort

00:30:27.450 --> 00:30:33.780 align:middle line:10%
of burlesque kind of lewd,
slightly pornographic reality

00:30:33.780 --> 00:30:36.330 align:middle line:10%
that's taking place in
Germany during that time.

00:30:36.330 --> 00:30:40.380 align:middle line:10%
And prostitution was
rampant because there

00:30:40.380 --> 00:30:41.420 align:middle line:10%
wasn't a lot of money.

00:30:41.420 --> 00:30:43.260 align:middle line:90%
I mean, Germany was broke.

00:30:43.260 --> 00:30:45.905 align:middle line:84%
They were, pardon my
expression, flat-ass broke.

00:30:45.905 --> 00:30:49.150 align:middle line:84%
And so you have these
undesirable elements sort

00:30:49.150 --> 00:30:53.660 align:middle line:84%
of rising up through
the cracks in society.

00:30:53.660 --> 00:30:56.600 align:middle line:84%
And if you've seen
the movie "Cabaret,"

00:30:56.600 --> 00:30:58.590 align:middle line:84%
they kind of get into
this a little bit.

00:30:58.590 --> 00:31:02.740 align:middle line:10%
This is the environment
of the Weimar Republic.

00:31:02.740 --> 00:31:03.570 align:middle line:10%
And what happens?

00:31:03.570 --> 00:31:07.420 align:middle line:10%
Well, once we have the pendulum
swing in one direction,

00:31:07.420 --> 00:31:10.555 align:middle line:10%
it's gotta swing back in
the other direction as well.

00:31:10.555 --> 00:31:11.890 align:middle line:10%
And here's the other direction.

00:31:11.890 --> 00:31:14.180 align:middle line:10%
This is the rise
of the Third Reich.

00:31:14.180 --> 00:31:15.950 align:middle line:10%
And Hitler comes
along, and he decides

00:31:15.950 --> 00:31:17.790 align:middle line:10%
he's going to clean up
the Weimar Republic.

00:31:17.790 --> 00:31:22.050 align:middle line:84%
He's going to cleanse the
depravity, the pornography.

00:31:22.050 --> 00:31:29.420 align:middle line:84%
And here we have the Third Reich
and the rise of the Nazi state.

00:31:29.420 --> 00:31:31.620 align:middle line:84%
And it all goes back
to World War I. Why?

00:31:31.620 --> 00:31:34.730 align:middle line:84%
Because we go into the
Treaty of Versailles,

00:31:34.730 --> 00:31:36.360 align:middle line:84%
and the economic
sanctions that were

00:31:36.360 --> 00:31:37.967 align:middle line:84%
leveled against
the German people.

00:31:37.967 --> 00:31:39.300 align:middle line:90%
It craters them psychologically.

00:31:39.300 --> 00:31:40.466 align:middle line:90%
It craters them emotionally.

00:31:40.466 --> 00:31:42.150 align:middle line:90%
It craters them spiritually.

00:31:42.150 --> 00:31:44.750 align:middle line:90%
it bankrupts them economically.

00:31:44.750 --> 00:31:48.100 align:middle line:10%
And then we have the
reaction, or the solution

00:31:48.100 --> 00:31:50.570 align:middle line:10%
to the reaction, manifest
in the Third Reich.

00:31:50.570 --> 00:31:52.090 align:middle line:90%
And we all know how that goes.

00:31:52.090 --> 00:31:57.080 align:middle line:84%
And here we have the Nuremberg
Trial, where the Nazi war

00:31:57.080 --> 00:32:01.270 align:middle line:84%
criminals were tried, and
then eventually hanged.

00:32:01.270 --> 00:32:03.780 align:middle line:84%
And out of this, out of
the Nuremberg Trials,

00:32:03.780 --> 00:32:06.890 align:middle line:84%
and out of everything that
takes place, and even starting

00:32:06.890 --> 00:32:10.080 align:middle line:84%
with World War I,
we see the migration

00:32:10.080 --> 00:32:12.230 align:middle line:90%
to the nation-state of Israel.

00:32:12.230 --> 00:32:14.030 align:middle line:84%
And it's like, well,
we need a place

00:32:14.030 --> 00:32:15.520 align:middle line:84%
where people can
feel safe, right?

00:32:15.520 --> 00:32:20.220 align:middle line:84%
I mean, we need a place
where the Jewish society can

00:32:20.220 --> 00:32:25.040 align:middle line:84%
repatriate and be in a
location that is their own.

00:32:25.040 --> 00:32:28.130 align:middle line:10%
And so we have the rise of
the nation-state of Israel,

00:32:28.130 --> 00:32:30.610 align:middle line:10%
and this is on May 14, 1948.

00:32:30.610 --> 00:32:34.800 align:middle line:10%
So we can see the evolution
of what's taking place here.

00:32:34.800 --> 00:32:36.110 align:middle line:90%
Now, this is Arthur Koestler.

00:32:36.110 --> 00:32:37.590 align:middle line:84%
Here's where it's going
to get a little tricky,

00:32:37.590 --> 00:32:39.673 align:middle line:84%
so you're going to have
to hang with me little bit

00:32:39.673 --> 00:32:41.855 align:middle line:90%
and try to just follow along.

00:32:41.855 --> 00:32:45.280 align:middle line:84%
Now, Arthur Koestler,
if we look at him

00:32:45.280 --> 00:32:48.490 align:middle line:84%
from a historical
standpoint, he was a Marxist

00:32:48.490 --> 00:32:50.720 align:middle line:84%
at one point in
time in his life.

00:32:50.720 --> 00:32:54.210 align:middle line:84%
He then became a Zionist
at another point in time

00:32:54.210 --> 00:32:55.070 align:middle line:90%
in his life.

00:32:55.070 --> 00:32:57.040 align:middle line:84%
And then he wound
up rejecting both.

00:32:57.040 --> 00:33:02.310 align:middle line:84%
And he became, really, an
amazing researcher and explorer

00:33:02.310 --> 00:33:05.730 align:middle line:84%
in psychological and
psychic phenomena.

00:33:05.730 --> 00:33:08.010 align:middle line:84%
But one of the things
that Koestler did

00:33:08.010 --> 00:33:12.560 align:middle line:84%
is he looked at his own origins,
the origins of his own family

00:33:12.560 --> 00:33:13.920 align:middle line:90%
and where they came from.

00:33:13.920 --> 00:33:17.840 align:middle line:84%
And he realized that his
family and other families

00:33:17.840 --> 00:33:21.790 align:middle line:84%
like him were descended from,
if we go back to the very first

00:33:21.790 --> 00:33:25.480 align:middle line:84%
or one of the first slides, are
descended from the Khazarian

00:33:25.480 --> 00:33:26.920 align:middle line:90%
Empire.

00:33:26.920 --> 00:33:30.900 align:middle line:84%
So he calls the Khazarian
Empire the "Thirteenth Tribe."

00:33:30.900 --> 00:33:34.170 align:middle line:84%
And what's interesting about
Koestler is that he's a Virgo,

00:33:34.170 --> 00:33:39.820 align:middle line:84%
and he has this unrelenting
sort of intellect

00:33:39.820 --> 00:33:46.270 align:middle line:84%
that will not cease until he's
come to some kind of epiphany

00:33:46.270 --> 00:33:49.470 align:middle line:84%
or resolution about what's
driving his interest.

00:33:49.470 --> 00:33:52.020 align:middle line:84%
And he was an author
of a number of books,

00:33:52.020 --> 00:33:54.090 align:middle line:84%
and this one is a really
controversial book.

00:33:54.090 --> 00:33:56.520 align:middle line:84%
There are people that will
disagree with his findings,

00:33:56.520 --> 00:33:59.560 align:middle line:84%
although there is a
contemporary scholar from Israel

00:33:59.560 --> 00:34:02.110 align:middle line:84%
by the name of Shlomo
Sand who's come up

00:34:02.110 --> 00:34:04.310 align:middle line:84%
with pretty much
the same hypothesis.

00:34:04.310 --> 00:34:05.760 align:middle line:84%
So the reason I
bring this up here

00:34:05.760 --> 00:34:07.330 align:middle line:84%
is because if we
go back to Ukraine

00:34:07.330 --> 00:34:10.020 align:middle line:84%
in the first slide,
who ruled Eastern

00:34:10.020 --> 00:34:12.500 align:middle line:84%
Ukraine during the
seventh century?

00:34:12.500 --> 00:34:13.489 align:middle line:90%
It was the Khazars.

00:34:13.489 --> 00:34:15.840 align:middle line:84%
And so what we're seeing
here, in some ways,

00:34:15.840 --> 00:34:18.195 align:middle line:84%
is the return of the
Khazarian Empire.

00:34:18.195 --> 00:34:20.260 align:middle line:84%
Now, he wrote a very
interesting book

00:34:20.260 --> 00:34:21.856 align:middle line:90%
called The Ghost in the Machine.

00:34:21.856 --> 00:34:23.439 align:middle line:84%
And The Ghost in the
Machine has to do

00:34:23.439 --> 00:34:25.620 align:middle line:84%
with this whole
idea of the holon.

00:34:25.620 --> 00:34:29.050 align:middle line:84%
And the holon is an
individual component

00:34:29.050 --> 00:34:31.070 align:middle line:84%
of human consciousness,
and it's kind

00:34:31.070 --> 00:34:33.870 align:middle line:84%
of a holographic
sort of perspective

00:34:33.870 --> 00:34:35.040 align:middle line:90%
of human consciousness.

00:34:35.040 --> 00:34:36.960 align:middle line:84%
He was way ahead
of the curve when

00:34:36.960 --> 00:34:40.540 align:middle line:84%
it came to some of the
material that has later

00:34:40.540 --> 00:34:43.630 align:middle line:84%
become very popular in terms of
new-age thought, consciousness,

00:34:43.630 --> 00:34:44.750 align:middle line:90%
and philosophy.

00:34:44.750 --> 00:34:47.810 align:middle line:84%
He also wrote a book called
The Roots of Coincidence, which

00:34:47.810 --> 00:34:50.739 align:middle line:84%
is still, to this day,
deemed one of the greatest

00:34:50.739 --> 00:34:52.540 align:middle line:90%
books on synchronicity.

00:34:52.540 --> 00:34:54.989 align:middle line:84%
He was following Jung at this
point in time in his life.

00:34:54.989 --> 00:34:59.690 align:middle line:84%
And he had an influence on
some contemporary artists.

00:34:59.690 --> 00:35:03.012 align:middle line:84%
Here's The Police, who
did an album called

00:35:03.012 --> 00:35:03.970 align:middle line:90%
"Ghost in the Machine."

00:35:03.970 --> 00:35:06.390 align:middle line:84%
It's pretty much based
on Koestler's work.

00:35:06.390 --> 00:35:08.882 align:middle line:84%
At this point in time, Sting
was reading a lot of Koestler.

00:35:08.882 --> 00:35:10.840 align:middle line:84%
It's interesting, if you
flip this upside down,

00:35:10.840 --> 00:35:12.996 align:middle line:84%
it actually looks like
666, but we're not

00:35:12.996 --> 00:35:14.370 align:middle line:90%
going to do that today.

00:35:14.370 --> 00:35:16.270 align:middle line:10%
And here we have
"Synchronicity,"

00:35:16.270 --> 00:35:18.630 align:middle line:10%
which is, I believe,
the record that

00:35:18.630 --> 00:35:20.490 align:middle line:10%
follows up "Ghost
in the Machine."

00:35:20.490 --> 00:35:23.820 align:middle line:10%
So you can tell that Sting
was not only into Jung,

00:35:23.820 --> 00:35:27.280 align:middle line:10%
but was also heavily reading
Koestler at the same time.

00:35:27.280 --> 00:35:29.205 align:middle line:10%
Here he is reading his
little book on Jung

00:35:29.205 --> 00:35:30.810 align:middle line:10%
and synchronicities.

00:35:30.810 --> 00:35:34.740 align:middle line:10%
So Koestler had a profound
influence on Sting

00:35:34.740 --> 00:35:37.560 align:middle line:10%
and The Police and
their music and art.

00:35:37.560 --> 00:35:42.640 align:middle line:10%
Now, here is Victoria
Nuland and Robert Kagan.

00:35:42.640 --> 00:35:44.110 align:middle line:10%
They're married.

00:35:44.110 --> 00:35:47.950 align:middle line:10%
Victoria Nuland, I've tried
to find a birth date for her.

00:35:47.950 --> 00:35:51.080 align:middle line:10%
The only thing I can
find is October, 1961,

00:35:51.080 --> 00:35:53.830 align:middle line:10%
which would make her either
a Libra or a Scorpio.

00:35:53.830 --> 00:35:55.230 align:middle line:90%
This is her husband.

00:35:55.230 --> 00:35:58.070 align:middle line:84%
This is the man who wrote the
Project for the New American

00:35:58.070 --> 00:36:02.230 align:middle line:84%
Century, which is kind of the
template for what happened

00:36:02.230 --> 00:36:05.089 align:middle line:90%
after 9/11 and the Patriot Act.

00:36:05.089 --> 00:36:05.880 align:middle line:90%
And it was deemed--

00:36:05.880 --> 00:36:08.780 align:middle line:90%


00:36:08.780 --> 00:36:11.720 align:middle line:84%
Project for a New American
Century, the subtitle

00:36:11.720 --> 00:36:13.860 align:middle line:90%
was "A Clean Break."

00:36:13.860 --> 00:36:19.660 align:middle line:84%
And the clean break was the
break or the demarcation

00:36:19.660 --> 00:36:24.200 align:middle line:84%
between being a country,
the United States, that

00:36:24.200 --> 00:36:29.170 align:middle line:84%
was going to defend its
territory when and if it

00:36:29.170 --> 00:36:33.530 align:middle line:84%
was attacked to being a
country that would be proactive

00:36:33.530 --> 00:36:37.580 align:middle line:84%
and would seek out
countries or would seek out

00:36:37.580 --> 00:36:43.120 align:middle line:84%
threats and target them, and
then use force when necessary.

00:36:43.120 --> 00:36:49.100 align:middle line:84%
It's a very different
philosophy than the philosophy

00:36:49.100 --> 00:36:52.300 align:middle line:84%
of being protective or
protecting the borders

00:36:52.300 --> 00:36:55.730 align:middle line:84%
or protecting other countries
if the United States'

00:36:55.730 --> 00:36:57.560 align:middle line:90%
interests were threatened.

00:36:57.560 --> 00:37:00.330 align:middle line:84%
Now, again, if you look
at the United States,

00:37:00.330 --> 00:37:04.110 align:middle line:84%
the birthday of the United
States is July 4, 1776,

00:37:04.110 --> 00:37:05.840 align:middle line:84%
and that is under
the sign of Cancer.

00:37:05.840 --> 00:37:08.810 align:middle line:84%
And Cancer is not a
sign that attacks.

00:37:08.810 --> 00:37:11.670 align:middle line:84%
The crab does not attack,
but the crab will defend.

00:37:11.670 --> 00:37:15.470 align:middle line:84%
And when we had 9/11/2001,
it changes everything.

00:37:15.470 --> 00:37:19.270 align:middle line:84%
It changes the astrological
complexion of the United States

00:37:19.270 --> 00:37:22.130 align:middle line:84%
and turns the United States into
a Virgo country in some ways.

00:37:22.130 --> 00:37:24.550 align:middle line:84%
And Virgo is quite
nervous, and Virgo

00:37:24.550 --> 00:37:27.670 align:middle line:84%
would be a sign that
would be proactive

00:37:27.670 --> 00:37:31.100 align:middle line:84%
when it would come
to retaliation

00:37:31.100 --> 00:37:33.150 align:middle line:90%
and/or preemptive strikes.

00:37:33.150 --> 00:37:34.800 align:middle line:84%
Virgo is a worst-case
scenario sign.

00:37:34.800 --> 00:37:40.740 align:middle line:84%
Anyway, Ms. Nuland was in
charge of the area in Ukraine.

00:37:40.740 --> 00:37:44.390 align:middle line:84%
And through her husband,
and specifically her,

00:37:44.390 --> 00:37:46.080 align:middle line:84%
she got the guy
in that she wanted

00:37:46.080 --> 00:37:49.170 align:middle line:84%
to be the leader of Ukraine,
the prime minister of Ukraine.

00:37:49.170 --> 00:37:52.170 align:middle line:84%
So here we have these two
people who were inserting--

00:37:52.170 --> 00:37:55.860 align:middle line:84%
and by the way, Kagan
is affectionately

00:37:55.860 --> 00:37:56.610 align:middle line:90%
known as a neocon.

00:37:56.610 --> 00:37:59.460 align:middle line:84%
So now we have the
neocon influence sort

00:37:59.460 --> 00:38:01.330 align:middle line:84%
of coming to the
fore in Ukraine.

00:38:01.330 --> 00:38:02.610 align:middle line:90%
She's gone now.

00:38:02.610 --> 00:38:03.710 align:middle line:90%
She's out of the picture.

00:38:03.710 --> 00:38:06.580 align:middle line:84%
And she was replaced
by Jen Psaki,

00:38:06.580 --> 00:38:10.512 align:middle line:84%
who is now the envoy for
that part of the world.

00:38:10.512 --> 00:38:12.720 align:middle line:84%
So what we've looked at
today in "The Eleventh House"

00:38:12.720 --> 00:38:16.880 align:middle line:84%
is we've tried to establish
that there are threads

00:38:16.880 --> 00:38:18.540 align:middle line:84%
that run through
history and time.

00:38:18.540 --> 00:38:22.170 align:middle line:84%
And again, we're seeing
the sign Aquarius come up

00:38:22.170 --> 00:38:25.670 align:middle line:84%
in a fairly large way as
it relates to revolution,

00:38:25.670 --> 00:38:29.130 align:middle line:84%
specifically in Ukraine and
in that part of the world.

00:38:29.130 --> 00:38:31.440 align:middle line:84%
We can see certain
players emerge.

00:38:31.440 --> 00:38:33.720 align:middle line:84%
We can see certain
planets emerge.

00:38:33.720 --> 00:38:38.341 align:middle line:84%
And we can see the re-emergence
of a group of people

00:38:38.341 --> 00:38:40.590 align:middle line:84%
who are essentially kind of
reclaiming where they came

00:38:40.590 --> 00:38:42.740 align:middle line:84%
from, and we're talking
about Eastern Ukraine

00:38:42.740 --> 00:38:44.540 align:middle line:90%
and the Khazarian Empire.

00:38:44.540 --> 00:38:47.150 align:middle line:84%
Again, it's a controversial
subject, controversial topic,

00:38:47.150 --> 00:38:49.290 align:middle line:84%
but that's what we do here
in "The Eleventh House,"

00:38:49.290 --> 00:38:51.050 align:middle line:84%
and I hope you found
it interesting, fair,

00:38:51.050 --> 00:38:51.810 align:middle line:90%
and balanced.

00:38:51.810 --> 00:38:54.520 align:middle line:10%
And until next time,
this is Robert Phoenix.

00:38:54.520 --> 00:38:56.160 align:middle line:10%
Take care.

00:38:56.160 --> 00:39:07.072 align:middle line:10%
