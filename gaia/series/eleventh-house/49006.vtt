00:00:16.897 --> 00:00:19.480 align:middle line:84%
>> ROBERT PHOENIX: Welcome back
to yet another edition of "The

00:00:19.480 --> 00:00:20.240 align:middle line:90%
Eleventh House."

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:22.935 align:middle line:10%
I'm Robert Phoenix,
and today, we're

00:00:22.935 --> 00:00:25.410 align:middle line:10%
going to be talking about
two planets that represent

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:28.265 align:middle line:10%
the masculine and the
feminine or the masculine

00:00:28.265 --> 00:00:31.260 align:middle line:10%
and the feminine depending
upon which side of the camera

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:31.990 align:middle line:10%
you're on.

00:00:31.990 --> 00:00:34.030 align:middle line:90%
Of course, it's Venus and Mars.

00:00:34.030 --> 00:00:37.570 align:middle line:84%
And just recently, Venus and
Mars-- and then, particularly

00:00:37.570 --> 00:00:39.690 align:middle line:84%
Mars currently--
have been involved

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:42.530 align:middle line:84%
in some pretty interesting
celestial activity.

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:46.050 align:middle line:84%
Venus went into Capricorn
in December of last year

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:48.180 align:middle line:84%
and just recently
came out of it.

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:51.460 align:middle line:84%
There was a retrograde period
of Venus in Capricorn as well.

00:00:51.460 --> 00:00:54.660 align:middle line:84%
Mars is in the sign of Libra
and will be in the sign of Libra

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:58.260 align:middle line:84%
until, I believe,
June of this year.

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:01.930 align:middle line:84%
And of course, it currently is
also in a retrograde period.

00:01:01.930 --> 00:01:04.950 align:middle line:84%
So we're going to look at
both Venus and Mars today

00:01:04.950 --> 00:01:07.630 align:middle line:84%
and what they mean
for you in terms

00:01:07.630 --> 00:01:11.040 align:middle line:84%
of both attraction
and the expression.

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:13.720 align:middle line:84%
And we're also going to
look at some Venus and Mars

00:01:13.720 --> 00:01:16.340 align:middle line:84%
phenomena that has
occurred recently

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:19.280 align:middle line:84%
and also throughout
history as well.

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:21.680 align:middle line:84%
So why don't we
start off with Venus?

00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:23.140 align:middle line:84%
You know, it's
pretty interesting

00:01:23.140 --> 00:01:26.940 align:middle line:84%
that in our culture,
Mars holds the greatest

00:01:26.940 --> 00:01:28.520 align:middle line:90%
amount of imagination.

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:32.680 align:middle line:84%
When we think of the planet that
has probably the most cinematic

00:01:32.680 --> 00:01:34.245 align:middle line:90%
import, it's almost always Mars.

00:01:34.245 --> 00:01:37.240 align:middle line:84%
It's about invasions from
Mars or the colonization

00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:39.840 align:middle line:84%
of Mars, which is what
we're talking about.

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:41.720 align:middle line:84%
Currently, there's
a group of people

00:01:41.720 --> 00:01:43.350 align:middle line:84%
who have signed
on to go to Mars.

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:46.400 align:middle line:84%
There's a documentary
film about their lives.

00:01:46.400 --> 00:01:49.350 align:middle line:84%
So Mars really grips
our consciousness

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:55.060 align:middle line:84%
while Venus is slightly distant
and isn't really talked about

00:01:55.060 --> 00:01:58.910 align:middle line:84%
or addressed very much in
terms of popular culture.

00:01:58.910 --> 00:02:01.920 align:middle line:84%
And yet, it's an
incredibly powerful planet

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:03.840 align:middle line:90%
as it relates to astrology.

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:06.840 align:middle line:84%
Venus is the planet
of relationship.

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:08.910 align:middle line:84%
And in many ways, it's
the planet of attraction.

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:12.070 align:middle line:84%
Where you have Venus in your
chart and what sign it's under

00:02:12.070 --> 00:02:15.810 align:middle line:84%
will connotate how
you interrelate

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:18.970 align:middle line:84%
with other people on
a relational level.

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:20.720 align:middle line:84%
So we might get into
a little bit of that,

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:23.250 align:middle line:84%
but let's just jump
into Venus here.

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:26.300 align:middle line:84%
So these are the planets of
attraction-- Venus and Mars.

00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:28.317 align:middle line:84%
Venus/Aphrodite
represents both attraction

00:02:28.317 --> 00:02:30.150 align:middle line:84%
and the nature and
quality of relationships,

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:32.260 align:middle line:90%
which I just said basically.

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:35.860 align:middle line:84%
Occasionally, it could represent
one's aesthetic relationship

00:02:35.860 --> 00:02:39.376 align:middle line:84%
with their physical reality and
surroundings, which is true.

00:02:39.376 --> 00:02:40.750 align:middle line:84%
So one of the
things that you may

00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:42.320 align:middle line:84%
want to look at
with your own chart

00:02:42.320 --> 00:02:47.400 align:middle line:84%
is to understand where Venus is
and what sign it's in and even

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:49.440 align:middle line:84%
what house it will
be in as well.

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:52.130 align:middle line:84%
Because then, you'll have a
better understanding of, A,

00:02:52.130 --> 00:02:55.990 align:middle line:84%
the types of relationships
that you enjoy

00:02:55.990 --> 00:03:00.400 align:middle line:84%
and like to have in your life
and how you can use that energy

00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:03.550 align:middle line:84%
and modality of Venus to be more
effective in a relationship.

00:03:03.550 --> 00:03:06.550 align:middle line:84%
For instance, I
have Venus in Libra.

00:03:06.550 --> 00:03:10.280 align:middle line:84%
And Venus in Libra likes to
create harmony and synergy

00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:12.300 align:middle line:90%
and balance and mediation.

00:03:12.300 --> 00:03:15.660 align:middle line:84%
So that's generally
how I relate to people.

00:03:15.660 --> 00:03:18.730 align:middle line:84%
And the reason why-- and
this is the secret of Venus--

00:03:18.730 --> 00:03:21.760 align:middle line:84%
is because Venus
will show you how

00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:24.536 align:middle line:84%
you want others to
relate to you as well.

00:03:24.536 --> 00:03:26.410 align:middle line:84%
So for instance, if you
have Venus in Libra--

00:03:26.410 --> 00:03:29.780 align:middle line:84%
like I do-- you will relate
to people in that fashion

00:03:29.780 --> 00:03:32.655 align:middle line:84%
because you would like to
have people relate back to you

00:03:32.655 --> 00:03:33.680 align:middle line:90%
in the same way.

00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:35.232 align:middle line:84%
So with Venus in
Libra, we're going

00:03:35.232 --> 00:03:36.330 align:middle line:90%
to have a civil discourse.

00:03:36.330 --> 00:03:37.655 align:middle line:90%
We could talk about art.

00:03:37.655 --> 00:03:38.380 align:middle line:90%
We could go out.

00:03:38.380 --> 00:03:41.190 align:middle line:84%
We can eat really nice
food, have drinks,

00:03:41.190 --> 00:03:45.130 align:middle line:84%
and life is one merry event,
but aesthetically pleasing.

00:03:45.130 --> 00:03:48.050 align:middle line:84%
Now, let's say you have
Venus in the sign of Scorpio,

00:03:48.050 --> 00:03:50.410 align:middle line:84%
then how you would
address other people--

00:03:50.410 --> 00:03:53.000 align:middle line:84%
deal with other people--
would be through intensity

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:54.670 align:middle line:90%
because Scorpio is intense.

00:03:54.670 --> 00:03:55.790 align:middle line:90%
It likes to feel.

00:03:55.790 --> 00:03:59.320 align:middle line:84%
So Venus in Scorpio would
create relationships

00:03:59.320 --> 00:04:02.020 align:middle line:84%
in a timbre of
relating in such a way

00:04:02.020 --> 00:04:05.690 align:middle line:84%
that the other person
would either be attracted

00:04:05.690 --> 00:04:09.010 align:middle line:84%
to that style of relating or be
repelled by it because Scorpio

00:04:09.010 --> 00:04:10.900 align:middle line:90%
is quite black and white.

00:04:10.900 --> 00:04:16.370 align:middle line:84%
So that's an example of
how Venus aspects Scorpio

00:04:16.370 --> 00:04:18.965 align:middle line:84%
and how it manifests in the
Venus in Scorpio component

00:04:18.965 --> 00:04:20.256 align:middle line:90%
in one's chart.

00:04:20.256 --> 00:04:21.339 align:middle line:90%
Let's use another example.

00:04:21.339 --> 00:04:23.530 align:middle line:84%
For instance, how
about Venus in Pisces?

00:04:23.530 --> 00:04:25.640 align:middle line:84%
Venus in Pisces would
be very, very different.

00:04:25.640 --> 00:04:28.350 align:middle line:90%
Pisces is very diffuse.

00:04:28.350 --> 00:04:30.740 align:middle line:84%
Pisces is all-inclusive,
and it can

00:04:30.740 --> 00:04:32.980 align:middle line:84%
be very, very
poetic and artistic.

00:04:32.980 --> 00:04:35.120 align:middle line:84%
So people who have
Venus in Pisces

00:04:35.120 --> 00:04:37.756 align:middle line:84%
would have a wide
range of friends.

00:04:37.756 --> 00:04:39.130 align:middle line:84%
They would have
people that could

00:04:39.130 --> 00:04:41.750 align:middle line:84%
be artists and
visionaries and people

00:04:41.750 --> 00:04:44.410 align:middle line:84%
that may be on the fringe
of society as well.

00:04:44.410 --> 00:04:48.280 align:middle line:84%
There would be very little
discrimination between castes

00:04:48.280 --> 00:04:52.030 align:middle line:84%
or classes within a
society or culture.

00:04:52.030 --> 00:04:54.990 align:middle line:84%
And there would be sort
of a poetic idealization

00:04:54.990 --> 00:04:59.097 align:middle line:84%
or a poetic romanticism
around people

00:04:59.097 --> 00:05:00.680 align:middle line:84%
and how they relate
to the individual.

00:05:00.680 --> 00:05:01.179 align:middle line:90%
Why?

00:05:01.179 --> 00:05:03.760 align:middle line:84%
Because a person who
has Venus in Pisces

00:05:03.760 --> 00:05:06.970 align:middle line:84%
would like that as part
of their social contract

00:05:06.970 --> 00:05:10.120 align:middle line:84%
as well-- to be accepted for
the entirety and the totality

00:05:10.120 --> 00:05:11.100 align:middle line:90%
of who they are.

00:05:11.100 --> 00:05:14.640 align:middle line:84%
So we can see not only
the type of people

00:05:14.640 --> 00:05:17.340 align:middle line:84%
that we attract through
Venus but also how we

00:05:17.340 --> 00:05:19.970 align:middle line:84%
want to be received and treated
by others through Venus as

00:05:19.970 --> 00:05:22.020 align:middle line:90%
well.

00:05:22.020 --> 00:05:23.892 align:middle line:84%
So we can see a person's
needs and desires.

00:05:23.892 --> 00:05:25.850 align:middle line:84%
They can be determined
by the location of Venus

00:05:25.850 --> 00:05:27.350 align:middle line:84%
in the chart via
placement and sign.

00:05:27.350 --> 00:05:29.260 align:middle line:84%
We just talked
about that as well.

00:05:29.260 --> 00:05:33.200 align:middle line:84%
Venus can also represent
the emotional disconnect

00:05:33.200 --> 00:05:34.830 align:middle line:90%
in relationships, too.

00:05:34.830 --> 00:05:38.450 align:middle line:84%
So for instance, if
I have Venus in Libra

00:05:38.450 --> 00:05:41.260 align:middle line:84%
and I'm trying to relate
to you in a fair, balanced,

00:05:41.260 --> 00:05:44.110 align:middle line:84%
sympathetic, synergistic
kind of way and, let's say,

00:05:44.110 --> 00:05:47.410 align:middle line:84%
you have Venus in
Capricorn, you may

00:05:47.410 --> 00:05:50.100 align:middle line:84%
think that the style of relating
that I'm sharing with you right

00:05:50.100 --> 00:05:52.920 align:middle line:84%
now might be superficial,
trivial, or light.

00:05:52.920 --> 00:05:55.550 align:middle line:84%
And what you want, really,
with Venus in Capricorn

00:05:55.550 --> 00:05:57.950 align:middle line:84%
is you want a relationship
that's important.

00:05:57.950 --> 00:06:00.670 align:middle line:84%
You want a relationship that'll
help you get ahead in life.

00:06:00.670 --> 00:06:03.400 align:middle line:84%
You want a relationship
that theoretically

00:06:03.400 --> 00:06:05.509 align:middle line:90%
would last a very long time.

00:06:05.509 --> 00:06:07.050 align:middle line:84%
So people who have
Venus in Capricorn

00:06:07.050 --> 00:06:08.720 align:middle line:84%
would be into
long-term planning.

00:06:08.720 --> 00:06:10.580 align:middle line:84%
They would see somebody
and say, hey, look.

00:06:10.580 --> 00:06:12.360 align:middle line:84%
I want you to be
a part of my life.

00:06:12.360 --> 00:06:14.610 align:middle line:84%
I am picky about who I choose
to be a part of my life.

00:06:14.610 --> 00:06:15.109 align:middle line:90%
Why?

00:06:15.109 --> 00:06:17.990 align:middle line:84%
Because my relationships are
long-lasting and enduring.

00:06:17.990 --> 00:06:19.250 align:middle line:90%
And you've got Venus in Libra.

00:06:19.250 --> 00:06:22.200 align:middle line:84%
And right now, all you want
to do is go to the coffee shop

00:06:22.200 --> 00:06:25.220 align:middle line:84%
and talk about poetry
or art or life.

00:06:25.220 --> 00:06:28.790 align:middle line:84%
And I've got a 401(k)
and a family to plan.

00:06:28.790 --> 00:06:31.360 align:middle line:84%
So there can be
emotional disconnect

00:06:31.360 --> 00:06:33.780 align:middle line:84%
as it relates to
the various signs.

00:06:33.780 --> 00:06:35.790 align:middle line:84%
Usually, we see
that in opposition

00:06:35.790 --> 00:06:38.770 align:middle line:90%
or in a square to Venus.

00:06:38.770 --> 00:06:42.450 align:middle line:84%
However, it is not a
static condition or a state

00:06:42.450 --> 00:06:45.900 align:middle line:84%
since Venus is always
being aspected in transit

00:06:45.900 --> 00:06:49.910 align:middle line:84%
as well as occupying new signs
through the progressed chart.

00:06:49.910 --> 00:06:53.120 align:middle line:84%
Now, I guess I used Venus
in Capricorn for a reason

00:06:53.120 --> 00:06:55.180 align:middle line:84%
because-- I didn't
really think about it.

00:06:55.180 --> 00:06:59.080 align:middle line:84%
But in my progressed chart, I
now have Venus in Capricorn.

00:06:59.080 --> 00:07:02.410 align:middle line:84%
So I've literally gone
from Venus in Libra,

00:07:02.410 --> 00:07:04.380 align:middle line:84%
and it has skipped--
well, it didn't skip.

00:07:04.380 --> 00:07:07.250 align:middle line:84%
It's gone through the
sign of Sagittarius,

00:07:07.250 --> 00:07:10.410 align:middle line:84%
and now it's in the early
degrees of Capricorn.

00:07:10.410 --> 00:07:13.170 align:middle line:84%
So even though I
have the foundation

00:07:13.170 --> 00:07:15.610 align:middle line:84%
for Venus in relationship
with my chart,

00:07:15.610 --> 00:07:17.750 align:middle line:84%
my progressed Venus in
the sign of Capricorn

00:07:17.750 --> 00:07:19.720 align:middle line:84%
means that I'm
thinking a lot more

00:07:19.720 --> 00:07:21.864 align:middle line:90%
seriously about relationships.

00:07:21.864 --> 00:07:23.530 align:middle line:84%
Again, I'm thinking
a bit more seriously

00:07:23.530 --> 00:07:27.370 align:middle line:84%
about who I relate with and
sort of the long-term value

00:07:27.370 --> 00:07:28.830 align:middle line:90%
of relating as well.

00:07:28.830 --> 00:07:31.170 align:middle line:84%
So I guess I just
sort of subconsciously

00:07:31.170 --> 00:07:33.420 align:middle line:84%
drew that out of
my psyche because I

00:07:33.420 --> 00:07:34.750 align:middle line:90%
was going to talk about that.

00:07:34.750 --> 00:07:36.550 align:middle line:84%
I didn't really
think about that.

00:07:36.550 --> 00:07:39.730 align:middle line:84%
But Venus in the birth sign
gives us the basic formation

00:07:39.730 --> 00:07:41.820 align:middle line:84%
of emotional needs and
signs of relationships.

00:07:41.820 --> 00:07:43.920 align:middle line:84%
So your Venus is
always been aspected.

00:07:43.920 --> 00:07:45.330 align:middle line:90%
That's number one.

00:07:45.330 --> 00:07:51.560 align:middle line:84%
That's how you can alter or open
or channel various influences,

00:07:51.560 --> 00:07:53.940 align:middle line:84%
degrees, and energies
as it relates

00:07:53.940 --> 00:07:55.480 align:middle line:90%
to your own natal Venus.

00:07:55.480 --> 00:07:56.430 align:middle line:90%
It's not static.

00:07:56.430 --> 00:07:59.820 align:middle line:84%
And again, over time,
view the progressed chart.

00:07:59.820 --> 00:08:04.280 align:middle line:84%
Sun, mercury, moon, and
Venus, roughly about a degree

00:08:04.280 --> 00:08:05.530 align:middle line:90%
per year.

00:08:05.530 --> 00:08:07.510 align:middle line:90%
A little bit slower on Venus.

00:08:07.510 --> 00:08:09.800 align:middle line:84%
The further out Venus
and Mars you get,

00:08:09.800 --> 00:08:12.430 align:middle line:84%
the slower the degrees are
with the progressed chart.

00:08:12.430 --> 00:08:14.670 align:middle line:84%
But eventually, over
time, your Venus

00:08:14.670 --> 00:08:17.860 align:middle line:90%
will shift into another sign.

00:08:17.860 --> 00:08:20.690 align:middle line:84%
And over the course of a
lifetime, two other signs.

00:08:20.690 --> 00:08:22.360 align:middle line:84%
I've lived half my
life-- theoretically,

00:08:22.360 --> 00:08:24.020 align:middle line:84%
if I'm going to
be 100 years old.

00:08:24.020 --> 00:08:25.570 align:middle line:84%
I've had Venus go
through two signs.

00:08:25.570 --> 00:08:27.560 align:middle line:84%
It's in Capricorn,
and it will probably

00:08:27.560 --> 00:08:31.710 align:middle line:84%
stay there until I
take my final breath.

00:08:31.710 --> 00:08:32.320 align:middle line:90%
Here we go.

00:08:32.320 --> 00:08:33.862 align:middle line:84%
Here's another aspect
of Venus, which

00:08:33.862 --> 00:08:35.653 align:middle line:84%
I thought was quite
interesting since we're

00:08:35.653 --> 00:08:36.519 align:middle line:90%
talking about Venus.

00:08:36.519 --> 00:08:38.950 align:middle line:84%
This was the transit of
Venus, which took place

00:08:38.950 --> 00:08:43.509 align:middle line:84%
in 2012-- June 5th
and 6th of 2012.

00:08:43.509 --> 00:08:45.550 align:middle line:84%
And what's interesting
about the transit of Venus

00:08:45.550 --> 00:08:48.460 align:middle line:84%
is that it's not
going to take place

00:08:48.460 --> 00:08:52.000 align:middle line:84%
for like another 104
years, but it flips.

00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:54.200 align:middle line:84%
So the next time the
Venus transit takes place,

00:08:54.200 --> 00:08:56.420 align:middle line:84%
Venus will be in the
sign of Sagittarius.

00:08:56.420 --> 00:08:58.420 align:middle line:90%
But this time it's in Gemini.

00:08:58.420 --> 00:09:01.050 align:middle line:84%
So it flips every time
there's the Venus transit.

00:09:01.050 --> 00:09:04.716 align:middle line:84%
So it was at 16 and
15 degrees Gemini.

00:09:04.716 --> 00:09:05.840 align:middle line:90%
So it was going retrograde.

00:09:05.840 --> 00:09:06.965 align:middle line:90%
That's part of the transit.

00:09:06.965 --> 00:09:08.980 align:middle line:90%
It's going back over the sun.

00:09:08.980 --> 00:09:12.709 align:middle line:84%
And the Sabian symbol
for these degrees

00:09:12.709 --> 00:09:14.000 align:middle line:90%
is actually really interesting.

00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:17.160 align:middle line:84%
Now, some of you may not know
what the Sabian symbols are.

00:09:17.160 --> 00:09:22.290 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to give you a crash
course in the Sabian symbols.

00:09:22.290 --> 00:09:25.140 align:middle line:84%
Back in the early part
of the 20th century,

00:09:25.140 --> 00:09:28.500 align:middle line:84%
there was a woman by the
name of Elsie Wheeler.

00:09:28.500 --> 00:09:30.150 align:middle line:90%
She was a psychic medium.

00:09:30.150 --> 00:09:32.100 align:middle line:90%
She was wheelchair-bound.

00:09:32.100 --> 00:09:34.650 align:middle line:84%
And she was friends
with a fellow

00:09:34.650 --> 00:09:38.500 align:middle line:84%
by the name of Marc Edmund
Jones, who was an astrologer.

00:09:38.500 --> 00:09:40.470 align:middle line:84%
And Marc Edmund Jones
wanted to come up

00:09:40.470 --> 00:09:44.100 align:middle line:84%
with a system that
had an image-- almost

00:09:44.100 --> 00:09:46.270 align:middle line:84%
like an archetypal
image-- associated

00:09:46.270 --> 00:09:48.650 align:middle line:90%
with every degree of the zodiac.

00:09:48.650 --> 00:09:53.330 align:middle line:84%
So 360 images for
the entire zodiac.

00:09:53.330 --> 00:09:55.390 align:middle line:84%
And he wanted to use
Elsie Wheeler, who

00:09:55.390 --> 00:09:58.880 align:middle line:84%
was a psychic medium, in
order to get these images.

00:09:58.880 --> 00:10:01.560 align:middle line:84%
And so since she was
bound to a wheelchair

00:10:01.560 --> 00:10:04.560 align:middle line:84%
and couldn't walk around
all that much, how they did

00:10:04.560 --> 00:10:07.780 align:middle line:84%
this was that they went to
Balboa Park in San Diego

00:10:07.780 --> 00:10:11.410 align:middle line:84%
and she literally channeled
the Sabian symbols

00:10:11.410 --> 00:10:15.170 align:middle line:84%
over the course of a weekend
in a car in Balboa Park

00:10:15.170 --> 00:10:16.700 align:middle line:90%
to Marc Edmund Jones.

00:10:16.700 --> 00:10:20.510 align:middle line:84%
And so what she was doing is
she was just kind of randomly

00:10:20.510 --> 00:10:26.260 align:middle line:84%
coming up with these images
as it related to a degree

00:10:26.260 --> 00:10:29.650 align:middle line:84%
that Marc Edmund Jones
had in his possession.

00:10:29.650 --> 00:10:34.170 align:middle line:84%
And then, he would sort of
doublecheck and psychically

00:10:34.170 --> 00:10:36.190 align:middle line:90%
fact check her imagery.

00:10:36.190 --> 00:10:39.040 align:middle line:84%
And as a result, we
have the Sabian symbols

00:10:39.040 --> 00:10:43.220 align:middle line:84%
thanks to Elsie Wheeler
and Marc Edmund Jones.

00:10:43.220 --> 00:10:45.100 align:middle line:84%
And there are a
number people who

00:10:45.100 --> 00:10:47.130 align:middle line:84%
have done some really
good work, including

00:10:47.130 --> 00:10:50.190 align:middle line:84%
Dane Rudhyar, whose
interpretation of the Sabian

00:10:50.190 --> 00:10:52.070 align:middle line:90%
symbols is terrific.

00:10:52.070 --> 00:10:56.109 align:middle line:84%
You know, I think that
the best person currently

00:10:56.109 --> 00:10:57.900 align:middle line:84%
who knows the Sabian
symbols inside and out

00:10:57.900 --> 00:11:00.810 align:middle line:84%
is the Australian
astrologer Lynda

00:11:00.810 --> 00:11:05.115 align:middle line:84%
Hill who has a strong
personal/spiritual connection

00:11:05.115 --> 00:11:07.490 align:middle line:84%
with Elsie Wheeler and has
done a lot of research on her.

00:11:07.490 --> 00:11:09.710 align:middle line:84%
And you can look up
Lynda Hill online.

00:11:09.710 --> 00:11:12.956 align:middle line:84%
In fact, she has the
website sabiansymbols.com

00:11:12.956 --> 00:11:16.370 align:middle line:84%
and the author of 360
Degrees Of Wisdom.

00:11:16.370 --> 00:11:21.070 align:middle line:84%
So Sabian symbol for the 16th
and 15th degrees of Gemini

00:11:21.070 --> 00:11:22.440 align:middle line:90%
is pretty interesting.

00:11:22.440 --> 00:11:28.260 align:middle line:84%
A woman activist in an emotional
speech dramatizing her cause.

00:11:28.260 --> 00:11:34.750 align:middle line:84%
Now, if you go back in time to
the 5th and 6th of June, 2012,

00:11:34.750 --> 00:11:37.140 align:middle line:84%
when the transit of
Venus was happening,

00:11:37.140 --> 00:11:39.650 align:middle line:84%
if you were on Facebook
and you're on Twitter

00:11:39.650 --> 00:11:42.820 align:middle line:84%
or you were following any
of the astrological blogs

00:11:42.820 --> 00:11:45.330 align:middle line:84%
or consciousness or
new thought blogs,

00:11:45.330 --> 00:11:47.740 align:middle line:84%
everybody was talking
about it being

00:11:47.740 --> 00:11:49.990 align:middle line:84%
the return of the goddess,
the rebirth of the goddess.

00:11:49.990 --> 00:11:54.210 align:middle line:84%
It was this infusion of
goddess and feminine-- Venusian

00:11:54.210 --> 00:11:57.890 align:middle line:84%
energy that was coming into our
lives at that point in time.

00:11:57.890 --> 00:12:00.340 align:middle line:84%
And what's fascinating
is is the Sabian symbol,

00:12:00.340 --> 00:12:04.410 align:middle line:84%
which was created for these
degrees many years ago,

00:12:04.410 --> 00:12:06.124 align:middle line:84%
actually kind of
resonates with that.

00:12:06.124 --> 00:12:08.665 align:middle line:84%
So what we have here through
the Venus transit or the transit

00:12:08.665 --> 00:12:13.170 align:middle line:84%
of Venus is the
rebirth of the goddess.

00:12:13.170 --> 00:12:15.250 align:middle line:84%
And then, after this--
not long after this,

00:12:15.250 --> 00:12:17.900 align:middle line:84%
actually-- this happens
in May-- I'm sorry--

00:12:17.900 --> 00:12:20.116 align:middle line:90%
June 5th and 6th of 2012.

00:12:20.116 --> 00:12:21.490 align:middle line:84%
And then, not long
after that, we

00:12:21.490 --> 00:12:28.900 align:middle line:84%
have the, in the public's mind,
in the public eye via cinema,

00:12:28.900 --> 00:12:31.530 align:middle line:84%
the birth of Katniss
Everdeen and the rise

00:12:31.530 --> 00:12:34.600 align:middle line:84%
in the birth of the feminine
hero in the Hunger Games.

00:12:34.600 --> 00:12:38.990 align:middle line:84%
And this theoretically comes
out of the Venus transit.

00:12:38.990 --> 00:12:41.090 align:middle line:84%
And of course, the
Hunger Games is

00:12:41.090 --> 00:12:44.330 align:middle line:84%
related to the sign of
Sagittarius and Katniss

00:12:44.330 --> 00:12:47.700 align:middle line:84%
Everdeen being the spirit
of Artemis, the archer.

00:12:47.700 --> 00:12:51.450 align:middle line:84%
Again, Sagittarius, which
is opposite Gemini as it

00:12:51.450 --> 00:12:52.830 align:middle line:90%
relates to the transit of Venus.

00:12:52.830 --> 00:12:56.270 align:middle line:84%
Some interesting interplay there
between the opposite signs.

00:12:56.270 --> 00:12:59.420 align:middle line:84%
The retrograde motion
reflects reverse polarity

00:12:59.420 --> 00:13:01.550 align:middle line:90%
in traditional relating.

00:13:01.550 --> 00:13:04.990 align:middle line:84%
Now, certainly, one
could make a case that,

00:13:04.990 --> 00:13:07.740 align:middle line:84%
since the transit
of Venus in Gemini,

00:13:07.740 --> 00:13:11.920 align:middle line:84%
which represents duality,
which represents in some ways

00:13:11.920 --> 00:13:15.960 align:middle line:84%
twinning and
sameness, that we have

00:13:15.960 --> 00:13:23.300 align:middle line:84%
had a significant rise in the
cultural inner-penetration

00:13:23.300 --> 00:13:25.040 align:middle line:90%
of same sex marriages.

00:13:25.040 --> 00:13:29.530 align:middle line:84%
I think if you were to go back
prior to the transit of Venus

00:13:29.530 --> 00:13:33.420 align:middle line:84%
and look at what's happened
since then, the amount of noise

00:13:33.420 --> 00:13:37.770 align:middle line:84%
and the amount of
news noise will

00:13:37.770 --> 00:13:42.450 align:middle line:84%
result in a much more sort
of graphic and a lot more

00:13:42.450 --> 00:13:47.370 align:middle line:84%
traction in a post-transit
of Venus culture and media.

00:13:47.370 --> 00:13:50.000 align:middle line:84%
So my sense here is
that this transit

00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:54.040 align:middle line:84%
of Venus, the retrograde action
in Gemini has in some ways

00:13:54.040 --> 00:13:57.240 align:middle line:84%
catalyzed this whole notion
around same-sex marriage

00:13:57.240 --> 00:13:59.740 align:middle line:90%
and relationships.

00:13:59.740 --> 00:14:03.070 align:middle line:84%
Now, what was also quite
interesting during this time

00:14:03.070 --> 00:14:05.900 align:middle line:84%
is that-- well, of course,
this is Queen Elizabeth.

00:14:05.900 --> 00:14:08.330 align:middle line:84%
But she was having
the Silver Jubilee

00:14:08.330 --> 00:14:11.820 align:middle line:84%
at the same time as
the transit of Venus.

00:14:11.820 --> 00:14:15.900 align:middle line:84%
Now, you can't tell me
that the people that

00:14:15.900 --> 00:14:17.760 align:middle line:84%
are running this
planet, the people that

00:14:17.760 --> 00:14:22.310 align:middle line:84%
are in the circle of power,
in the matrix of control

00:14:22.310 --> 00:14:24.530 align:middle line:84%
don't have any
knowledge of astrology

00:14:24.530 --> 00:14:28.110 align:middle line:84%
because clearly the return
of the goddess, the transit

00:14:28.110 --> 00:14:32.140 align:middle line:84%
of Venus, here she is--
the, quote/unquote,

00:14:32.140 --> 00:14:34.870 align:middle line:84%
"matriarch of the planet,"
the Queen of England.

00:14:34.870 --> 00:14:40.900 align:middle line:84%
And this is one of the official
images of this Diamond Jubilee.

00:14:40.900 --> 00:14:44.180 align:middle line:84%
And what's fascinating about
it is-- what do we see?

00:14:44.180 --> 00:14:46.750 align:middle line:84%
We see the reflection
of the Queen

00:14:46.750 --> 00:14:48.880 align:middle line:84%
in the mirror, which
represents what?

00:14:48.880 --> 00:14:49.380 align:middle line:90%
Gemini.

00:14:49.380 --> 00:14:51.730 align:middle line:84%
It represents two
states, two beings,

00:14:51.730 --> 00:14:53.110 align:middle line:90%
and the reflection of which.

00:14:53.110 --> 00:14:59.500 align:middle line:84%
So not only was she tapping
into the astrological power

00:14:59.500 --> 00:15:01.370 align:middle line:84%
of the transit of
Venus, but there

00:15:01.370 --> 00:15:04.440 align:middle line:84%
is a symbolic
representation with Gemini

00:15:04.440 --> 00:15:08.160 align:middle line:84%
here in this reflection and
in this royal and official

00:15:08.160 --> 00:15:13.510 align:middle line:84%
depiction of the
Diamond Jubilee.

00:15:13.510 --> 00:15:16.880 align:middle line:84%
Now, what was also fascinating
is right after this,

00:15:16.880 --> 00:15:21.520 align:middle line:84%
during the transit of Venus,
Ray Bradbury, the author, died.

00:15:21.520 --> 00:15:24.540 align:middle line:84%
I think he died on June
6th, if I'm not mistaken.

00:15:24.540 --> 00:15:26.960 align:middle line:84%
And what was one of Ray
Bradbury's famous novels?

00:15:26.960 --> 00:15:28.680 align:middle line:90%
The Martian Chronicles.

00:15:28.680 --> 00:15:32.420 align:middle line:84%
So here we have the opposite of
the transit of Venus, and Ray

00:15:32.420 --> 00:15:36.590 align:middle line:84%
Bradbury, which is
the masculine version,

00:15:36.590 --> 00:15:38.700 align:middle line:90%
and the representation of Mars.

00:15:38.700 --> 00:15:41.110 align:middle line:90%
And this is diminishing.

00:15:41.110 --> 00:15:43.490 align:middle line:84%
It is in the
diminutive state as it

00:15:43.490 --> 00:15:46.652 align:middle line:84%
relates to Venus and the rise of
Venus and the transit of Venus.

00:15:46.652 --> 00:15:48.360 align:middle line:84%
Now, I'm not saying
that somebody decided

00:15:48.360 --> 00:15:51.010 align:middle line:84%
to pull the plug on
Ray Bradbury's life.

00:15:51.010 --> 00:15:55.050 align:middle line:84%
But in kind of a grand,
cosmological theater,

00:15:55.050 --> 00:15:58.860 align:middle line:84%
it's an interesting event that
we see the decline of Mars

00:15:58.860 --> 00:16:01.620 align:middle line:84%
and the rise of Venus within
the span of about 48 hours

00:16:01.620 --> 00:16:03.940 align:middle line:90%
during the transit of Venus.

00:16:03.940 --> 00:16:07.090 align:middle line:84%
Now, here, I wanted
to find an image that

00:16:07.090 --> 00:16:11.430 align:middle line:84%
was sort of symbolic
of Venus in Capricorn.

00:16:11.430 --> 00:16:14.280 align:middle line:84%
And so here we have
this Venusian figure,

00:16:14.280 --> 00:16:16.310 align:middle line:84%
who kind of looks a little
bit like Uma Thurman.

00:16:16.310 --> 00:16:17.330 align:middle line:90%
Doesn't it?

00:16:17.330 --> 00:16:21.650 align:middle line:84%
So we have this Venusian figure
with sort of the Botticelli,

00:16:21.650 --> 00:16:25.910 align:middle line:84%
sort of the Rubenesque
rounded curves, which

00:16:25.910 --> 00:16:28.410 align:middle line:84%
was classic form
for Venus back then.

00:16:28.410 --> 00:16:32.730 align:middle line:84%
Then, over here, we have
this interesting character.

00:16:32.730 --> 00:16:36.970 align:middle line:84%
And he kind of, in some ways,
has a Capricornian feel to him

00:16:36.970 --> 00:16:39.680 align:middle line:84%
because Capricorn
at one point in time

00:16:39.680 --> 00:16:42.550 align:middle line:90%
was this image of the sea-goat.

00:16:42.550 --> 00:16:43.050 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:16:43.050 --> 00:16:46.100 align:middle line:84%
It was part goat and,
actually, part dolphin.

00:16:46.100 --> 00:16:48.700 align:middle line:84%
And this is part
man and part-- which

00:16:48.700 --> 00:16:51.490 align:middle line:84%
looks like-- fish arising
out of the sort of the mists

00:16:51.490 --> 00:16:53.620 align:middle line:90%
of the ocean here or the waters.

00:16:53.620 --> 00:16:57.100 align:middle line:84%
But he has a very
Capricornian, very kind

00:16:57.100 --> 00:16:59.030 align:middle line:90%
of craggy and old look.

00:16:59.030 --> 00:17:01.560 align:middle line:84%
So this, to me,
this is the marriage

00:17:01.560 --> 00:17:06.214 align:middle line:84%
of Venus in Capricorn in this
photo or in this painting.

00:17:06.214 --> 00:17:07.589 align:middle line:84%
And so what we're
going to do now

00:17:07.589 --> 00:17:10.650 align:middle line:84%
is we're going to look at some
events, which have taken place

00:17:10.650 --> 00:17:12.599 align:middle line:84%
during Venus in
Capricorn, some of which

00:17:12.599 --> 00:17:15.290 align:middle line:90%
were Venus retrograde Capricorn.

00:17:15.290 --> 00:17:16.960 align:middle line:90%
Yulia Tymoshenko.

00:17:16.960 --> 00:17:20.079 align:middle line:90%
She was, again, Venus.

00:17:20.079 --> 00:17:20.910 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:17:20.910 --> 00:17:21.451 align:middle line:90%
The feminine.

00:17:21.451 --> 00:17:23.540 align:middle line:90%
The feminine energy.

00:17:23.540 --> 00:17:26.990 align:middle line:84%
She was in prison for
two years in Ukraine,

00:17:26.990 --> 00:17:32.021 align:middle line:84%
and she was released during
Venus in Capricorn retrograde.

00:17:32.021 --> 00:17:32.520 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:17:32.520 --> 00:17:33.710 align:middle line:90%
Released.

00:17:33.710 --> 00:17:34.650 align:middle line:90%
Retrograde.

00:17:34.650 --> 00:17:40.220 align:middle line:84%
And her presence in
some ways catalyzed

00:17:40.220 --> 00:17:42.680 align:middle line:90%
what has taken place in Ukraine.

00:17:42.680 --> 00:17:44.100 align:middle line:84%
So whenever we
look at retrograde,

00:17:44.100 --> 00:17:47.784 align:middle line:84%
we look at other words
that are connected to it.

00:17:47.784 --> 00:17:49.200 align:middle line:84%
There's another
example that we're

00:17:49.200 --> 00:17:52.340 align:middle line:84%
going to see here
in just a moment.

00:17:52.340 --> 00:17:54.100 align:middle line:90%
This is kind of interesting.

00:17:54.100 --> 00:17:57.230 align:middle line:84%
This woman is named
Colleen LaRose,

00:17:57.230 --> 00:18:01.120 align:middle line:84%
and she went by the
name of "Jihad Jane."

00:18:01.120 --> 00:18:03.720 align:middle line:84%
Somebody's got to make
a movie of this woman.

00:18:03.720 --> 00:18:07.610 align:middle line:84%
If you read about her biography
online, it's a tragic life.

00:18:07.610 --> 00:18:10.470 align:middle line:84%
There's a lot of abuse
that's associated with her.

00:18:10.470 --> 00:18:13.250 align:middle line:84%
And eventually, what
happens-- she's American.

00:18:13.250 --> 00:18:18.040 align:middle line:84%
Eventually, what happens is she
meets a Muslim guy at a bar.

00:18:18.040 --> 00:18:19.040 align:middle line:90%
If you can imagine that.

00:18:19.040 --> 00:18:19.956 align:middle line:90%
A Muslim guy at a bar.

00:18:19.956 --> 00:18:21.990 align:middle line:84%
I don't know how it
happens, but she found him.

00:18:21.990 --> 00:18:26.790 align:middle line:84%
And he turned her on to
Islam and not only Islam,

00:18:26.790 --> 00:18:29.460 align:middle line:84%
but the, quote/unquote,
"social injustices"

00:18:29.460 --> 00:18:33.240 align:middle line:84%
that have taken place at the
hands of Muslims in a post-9/11

00:18:33.240 --> 00:18:34.050 align:middle line:90%
world.

00:18:34.050 --> 00:18:36.710 align:middle line:84%
So she became very sympathetic
to the plight of Muslims,

00:18:36.710 --> 00:18:38.520 align:middle line:90%
and she converted to Islam.

00:18:38.520 --> 00:18:40.190 align:middle line:84%
And she decided
that she was going

00:18:40.190 --> 00:18:43.020 align:middle line:90%
to be a Muslim sympathizer.

00:18:43.020 --> 00:18:49.500 align:middle line:84%
Well, during the Venus in
Capricorn cycle on January 6th,

00:18:49.500 --> 00:18:53.070 align:middle line:84%
she was sentenced to
10 years in prison

00:18:53.070 --> 00:18:58.470 align:middle line:84%
for her conspiring with,
quote/unquote, "terrorists."

00:18:58.470 --> 00:19:00.700 align:middle line:84%
But what I thought
was really interesting

00:19:00.700 --> 00:19:04.340 align:middle line:84%
was that she was born
on June 5th, 1963.

00:19:04.340 --> 00:19:06.020 align:middle line:90%
And where did we see June 5th?

00:19:06.020 --> 00:19:06.770 align:middle line:90%
Right here.

00:19:06.770 --> 00:19:08.310 align:middle line:90%
Transit of Venus.

00:19:08.310 --> 00:19:11.740 align:middle line:84%
So she actually
has, in some ways,

00:19:11.740 --> 00:19:14.840 align:middle line:84%
she has this essence,
this feminine essence

00:19:14.840 --> 00:19:16.810 align:middle line:84%
of the return of the
goddess, but here

00:19:16.810 --> 00:19:19.100 align:middle line:84%
it's kind of a negative
representation.

00:19:19.100 --> 00:19:23.166 align:middle line:84%
But we can see certainly
with Gemini two

00:19:23.166 --> 00:19:24.040 align:middle line:90%
different identities.

00:19:24.040 --> 00:19:24.730 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:19:24.730 --> 00:19:27.270 align:middle line:90%
Jihad Jane and Colleen LaRose.

00:19:27.270 --> 00:19:30.420 align:middle line:84%
In one person, two
separate realities.

00:19:30.420 --> 00:19:30.920 align:middle line:90%
Gemini.

00:19:30.920 --> 00:19:34.275 align:middle line:84%
She was born in the Year
of the Tiger as well.

00:19:34.275 --> 00:19:34.900 align:middle line:90%
That's leopard.

00:19:34.900 --> 00:19:36.480 align:middle line:90%
That's not a tiger.

00:19:36.480 --> 00:19:36.980 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:19:36.980 --> 00:19:39.840 align:middle line:90%
Do you recognize this face?

00:19:39.840 --> 00:19:41.780 align:middle line:90%
This is Amanda Knox.

00:19:41.780 --> 00:19:45.940 align:middle line:84%
And of course, her and her
boyfriend, Raffaele Sollecito,

00:19:45.940 --> 00:19:51.390 align:middle line:84%
were charged with the murder
of Meredith Kercher in Italy.

00:19:51.390 --> 00:19:54.940 align:middle line:84%
And she spent time in
jail-- prison in Italy,

00:19:54.940 --> 00:20:00.250 align:middle line:84%
and she was "retried"
during, yes,

00:20:00.250 --> 00:20:03.420 align:middle line:90%
Venus retrograde in Capricorn.

00:20:03.420 --> 00:20:06.250 align:middle line:84%
She was retried
during that time.

00:20:06.250 --> 00:20:08.700 align:middle line:84%
And so we have a
retrial retrograde.

00:20:08.700 --> 00:20:09.320 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:20:09.320 --> 00:20:11.380 align:middle line:90%
Tymoshenko released.

00:20:11.380 --> 00:20:15.090 align:middle line:84%
And what happened was
is she was found guilty.

00:20:15.090 --> 00:20:16.320 align:middle line:90%
Again.

00:20:16.320 --> 00:20:18.850 align:middle line:84%
However, she's
living in Seattle.

00:20:18.850 --> 00:20:22.560 align:middle line:84%
And I don't think she's going
back to Italy any time soon.

00:20:22.560 --> 00:20:26.970 align:middle line:84%
However, Raffaele Sollecito was
arrested and is now in custody.

00:20:26.970 --> 00:20:30.785 align:middle line:84%
So it's kind of an interesting
piece here, this whole concept.

00:20:30.785 --> 00:20:33.790 align:middle line:84%
Venus in Capricorn, also is
a kar-- Venus in Capricorn

00:20:33.790 --> 00:20:36.100 align:middle line:90%
is incredibly karmic.

00:20:36.100 --> 00:20:37.730 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:20:37.730 --> 00:20:40.630 align:middle line:84%
I don't know what happened to
you during Venus in Capricorn,

00:20:40.630 --> 00:20:43.660 align:middle line:84%
but for me, Venus in
Capricorn was very powerful.

00:20:43.660 --> 00:20:46.390 align:middle line:84%
And I had to deal with
the karmic implications

00:20:46.390 --> 00:20:48.890 align:middle line:84%
of current and
past relationships.

00:20:48.890 --> 00:20:52.995 align:middle line:84%
And in this case,
so did Amanda Knox.

00:20:52.995 --> 00:20:56.640 align:middle line:84%
Now, this beautiful
woman is Monica Spears,

00:20:56.640 --> 00:20:58.860 align:middle line:90%
and she was Miss Venezuela.

00:20:58.860 --> 00:21:01.190 align:middle line:84%
She was a soap
star in Venezuela.

00:21:01.190 --> 00:21:03.570 align:middle line:84%
She actually went to, I
believe, the University

00:21:03.570 --> 00:21:06.250 align:middle line:84%
of Central Florida
here in this country.

00:21:06.250 --> 00:21:09.940 align:middle line:84%
And she was murdered during
the Venus in Capricorn.

00:21:09.940 --> 00:21:13.980 align:middle line:84%
And what I felt was
interesting about her

00:21:13.980 --> 00:21:16.040 align:middle line:90%
was that she is a Libra.

00:21:16.040 --> 00:21:17.700 align:middle line:84%
And when we talk
about Libra, Libra's

00:21:17.700 --> 00:21:19.530 align:middle line:90%
ruled by the planet Venus.

00:21:19.530 --> 00:21:23.800 align:middle line:84%
And she is, in some
ways, a modern version

00:21:23.800 --> 00:21:27.050 align:middle line:84%
of Venus or Aphrodite,
replete with her crown

00:21:27.050 --> 00:21:28.980 align:middle line:90%
chakra exploding.

00:21:28.980 --> 00:21:29.840 align:middle line:90%
Beautiful woman.

00:21:29.840 --> 00:21:32.830 align:middle line:84%
And she was-- her
and her ex-husband

00:21:32.830 --> 00:21:36.150 align:middle line:84%
and her daughter were
robbed at gunpoints

00:21:36.150 --> 00:21:38.860 align:middle line:84%
when their car broke
down in Venezuela.

00:21:38.860 --> 00:21:42.040 align:middle line:84%
So I just wanted to bring
this into the discussion

00:21:42.040 --> 00:21:47.140 align:middle line:84%
because, during this
Venus/Capricorn cycle,

00:21:47.140 --> 00:21:51.450 align:middle line:84%
we have a symbol of Venus, who,
unfortunately, lost her life.

00:21:51.450 --> 00:21:54.870 align:middle line:84%
And at that time, the
day that she died,

00:21:54.870 --> 00:21:59.960 align:middle line:84%
her sun was square,
the sun in Capricorn.

00:21:59.960 --> 00:22:02.320 align:middle line:90%
So, you know, God bless her.

00:22:02.320 --> 00:22:04.450 align:middle line:90%
Rest in peace.

00:22:04.450 --> 00:22:07.160 align:middle line:10%
Now, another
interesting thing that

00:22:07.160 --> 00:22:11.830 align:middle line:10%
took place during this
Venus transit in Capricorn--

00:22:11.830 --> 00:22:13.890 align:middle line:10%
and especially during
the retrograde piece--

00:22:13.890 --> 00:22:18.660 align:middle line:10%
is that Spain decided to
welcome back the Sephardic Jews

00:22:18.660 --> 00:22:21.167 align:middle line:10%
that they had
kicked out in 1492.

00:22:21.167 --> 00:22:22.000 align:middle line:90%
This all took place.

00:22:22.000 --> 00:22:24.880 align:middle line:84%
Again, we're talking
karmic relationships.

00:22:24.880 --> 00:22:28.870 align:middle line:84%
These are the people that,
essentially, either fled

00:22:28.870 --> 00:22:35.450 align:middle line:84%
or were asked to leave on
the heels of the Inquisition.

00:22:35.450 --> 00:22:40.820 align:middle line:84%
So based on the right of return,
Spain said, hey, come on back.

00:22:40.820 --> 00:22:43.670 align:middle line:90%
We're sorry.

00:22:43.670 --> 00:22:46.180 align:middle line:84%
We want to make
amends for our karma.

00:22:46.180 --> 00:22:47.530 align:middle line:90%
You know, we're Catholic.

00:22:47.530 --> 00:22:50.220 align:middle line:84%
We're a Catholic
nation, and we forgive.

00:22:50.220 --> 00:22:53.110 align:middle line:84%
So this took place during
Venus in Capricorn.

00:22:53.110 --> 00:22:54.910 align:middle line:84%
It didn't get a
lot of press, but I

00:22:54.910 --> 00:22:58.180 align:middle line:84%
thought it was
worthy of mentioning.

00:22:58.180 --> 00:23:00.250 align:middle line:84%
Now, I just wanted
to include this.

00:23:00.250 --> 00:23:02.090 align:middle line:84%
I think this is
an amazing picture

00:23:02.090 --> 00:23:04.220 align:middle line:84%
because, in our society
and our culture,

00:23:04.220 --> 00:23:09.340 align:middle line:84%
we are so accustomed
to a particular version

00:23:09.340 --> 00:23:10.919 align:middle line:90%
or symbol of Venus.

00:23:10.919 --> 00:23:12.710 align:middle line:84%
And while I was putting
this show together,

00:23:12.710 --> 00:23:15.560 align:middle line:84%
I decided to type
in "black Venus."

00:23:15.560 --> 00:23:18.330 align:middle line:84%
And there's a whole
collection of photographs

00:23:18.330 --> 00:23:22.480 align:middle line:84%
like this by a photographer
from Atlanta, Georgia.

00:23:22.480 --> 00:23:25.230 align:middle line:84%
And this was one
of them, and I just

00:23:25.230 --> 00:23:28.780 align:middle line:84%
thought this was a pretty
cool representation

00:23:28.780 --> 00:23:31.610 align:middle line:84%
of an alternative
version of Venus.

00:23:31.610 --> 00:23:33.010 align:middle line:90%
And I put this up on Facebook.

00:23:33.010 --> 00:23:37.130 align:middle line:84%
And there was this
African-American woman who

00:23:37.130 --> 00:23:39.921 align:middle line:84%
typed in, "You German
guys are all the same."

00:23:39.921 --> 00:23:40.920 align:middle line:90%
And I'm not even German.

00:23:40.920 --> 00:23:44.341 align:middle line:84%
I thought it was
a funny comment.

00:23:44.341 --> 00:23:44.840 align:middle line:90%
All right.

00:23:44.840 --> 00:23:46.670 align:middle line:84%
So let's shift
from Venus to Mars.

00:23:46.670 --> 00:23:49.320 align:middle line:84%
Let's talk about
Mars a little bit.

00:23:49.320 --> 00:23:51.820 align:middle line:84%
We're going from the
feminine to the masculine.

00:23:51.820 --> 00:23:57.880 align:middle line:10%
So Mars is the planet of
fire, friction, and passion.

00:23:57.880 --> 00:24:02.680 align:middle line:10%
Mars marks our vital expression
and how we direct our energy

00:24:02.680 --> 00:24:03.960 align:middle line:10%
and will.

00:24:03.960 --> 00:24:05.930 align:middle line:10%
In the realm of
personal relationships,

00:24:05.930 --> 00:24:11.370 align:middle line:10%
it allows us to manifest a
broad spectrum of emotions

00:24:11.370 --> 00:24:12.990 align:middle line:10%
based on heat.

00:24:12.990 --> 00:24:15.700 align:middle line:10%
That's what Mars does.

00:24:15.700 --> 00:24:17.590 align:middle line:10%
Where we have Mars
in our chart is

00:24:17.590 --> 00:24:19.960 align:middle line:10%
where we need to
devote our energies.

00:24:19.960 --> 00:24:23.400 align:middle line:10%
Having a conscious
stewardship of Mars

00:24:23.400 --> 00:24:28.120 align:middle line:10%
allows us to live within
the astrological parameters

00:24:28.120 --> 00:24:29.130 align:middle line:10%
of our will.

00:24:29.130 --> 00:24:32.650 align:middle line:10%
So what am I
saying, or what am I

00:24:32.650 --> 00:24:35.620 align:middle line:10%
trying to share with you
as we break that down.

00:24:35.620 --> 00:24:41.420 align:middle line:84%
Basically, the algebra,
the formula for this is

00:24:41.420 --> 00:24:43.830 align:middle line:84%
is that you need to
know where your Mars is.

00:24:43.830 --> 00:24:46.500 align:middle line:84%
If you understand where your
Mars is, what planet-- or, I'm

00:24:46.500 --> 00:24:48.130 align:middle line:84%
sorry-- what sign
it's in, you'll

00:24:48.130 --> 00:24:51.031 align:middle line:84%
have a better understanding
of your own personal energy.

00:24:51.031 --> 00:24:51.530 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:24:51.530 --> 00:24:56.990 align:middle line:84%
So let's say you have
Mars in-- how about Virgo?

00:24:56.990 --> 00:24:58.520 align:middle line:84%
Let's say you have
Mars in Virgo.

00:24:58.520 --> 00:25:02.470 align:middle line:84%
That Mars energy is
well-placed towards service,

00:25:02.470 --> 00:25:05.840 align:middle line:84%
towards helping,
towards healing.

00:25:05.840 --> 00:25:08.850 align:middle line:90%
Virgo is a Mercurial sign.

00:25:08.850 --> 00:25:10.810 align:middle line:90%
It's a very nervous sign.

00:25:10.810 --> 00:25:16.160 align:middle line:84%
So when we attach Mars to it,
we have this dynamic Martian

00:25:16.160 --> 00:25:20.800 align:middle line:84%
will-based energy with
this Mercurial peripatetic

00:25:20.800 --> 00:25:23.040 align:middle line:90%
and at times an unstable sign.

00:25:23.040 --> 00:25:23.540 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:25:23.540 --> 00:25:25.080 align:middle line:90%
Because Mercury is unstable.

00:25:25.080 --> 00:25:29.480 align:middle line:84%
Mercury rules Virgo, at least
in traditional astrology.

00:25:29.480 --> 00:25:31.260 align:middle line:90%
So it could be liquid.

00:25:31.260 --> 00:25:32.030 align:middle line:90%
It could be solid.

00:25:32.030 --> 00:25:33.030 align:middle line:90%
It could be stable.

00:25:33.030 --> 00:25:34.330 align:middle line:90%
It could be unstable.

00:25:34.330 --> 00:25:37.730 align:middle line:84%
So when Mars comes
together with Virgo,

00:25:37.730 --> 00:25:40.680 align:middle line:84%
it adds a certain amount
of intensity and energy

00:25:40.680 --> 00:25:43.360 align:middle line:90%
to an already Mercurial sign.

00:25:43.360 --> 00:25:44.940 align:middle line:90%
So what do we do with that?

00:25:44.940 --> 00:25:48.040 align:middle line:84%
Well, you need to stay
active with Mars in Virgo.

00:25:48.040 --> 00:25:51.710 align:middle line:84%
You've got to be able to
stay healthy, number one.

00:25:51.710 --> 00:25:53.720 align:middle line:84%
Physical fitness would
be very, very important

00:25:53.720 --> 00:25:55.450 align:middle line:84%
because you need
to run that energy.

00:25:55.450 --> 00:25:57.070 align:middle line:84%
You need to keep
that energy flowing.

00:25:57.070 --> 00:25:59.570 align:middle line:84%
You need to watch your
body, watch your health.

00:25:59.570 --> 00:26:00.270 align:middle line:90%
And guess what?

00:26:00.270 --> 00:26:01.644 align:middle line:84%
When you get really
good at that,

00:26:01.644 --> 00:26:04.480 align:middle line:84%
then you can help other people
as well because Mars in Virgo

00:26:04.480 --> 00:26:07.710 align:middle line:84%
is excellent for service
and excellent for reaching

00:26:07.710 --> 00:26:10.040 align:middle line:84%
out and not only
being of service

00:26:10.040 --> 00:26:12.170 align:middle line:90%
but seeing what's wrong.

00:26:12.170 --> 00:26:15.220 align:middle line:84%
Mars in Virgo could be
very, very diagnostic

00:26:15.220 --> 00:26:19.900 align:middle line:84%
but can also offer strategies
based on the diagnosis,

00:26:19.900 --> 00:26:23.010 align:middle line:84%
whether it's for a
sickness or an illness

00:26:23.010 --> 00:26:25.430 align:middle line:84%
or within an organization
or a corporation.

00:26:25.430 --> 00:26:27.890 align:middle line:84%
So that's one example
of Mars in Virgo.

00:26:27.890 --> 00:26:30.460 align:middle line:84%
Now, what Mars in
Virgo does not do well

00:26:30.460 --> 00:26:32.620 align:middle line:90%
is it doesn't lead well.

00:26:32.620 --> 00:26:35.330 align:middle line:84%
Mars in Virgo would
be out of place

00:26:35.330 --> 00:26:39.710 align:middle line:84%
if it was telling
people what to do.

00:26:39.710 --> 00:26:45.360 align:middle line:84%
It would be kind of a
cognitively dissonant

00:26:45.360 --> 00:26:47.670 align:middle line:90%
expression of Mars.

00:26:47.670 --> 00:26:51.170 align:middle line:84%
That would be more like Mars
in Leo or Mars in Aries.

00:26:51.170 --> 00:26:54.600 align:middle line:84%
If somebody has Mars in Leo
and they say, "Hey can you

00:26:54.600 --> 00:26:57.220 align:middle line:84%
do this?" or, "Go do this,"
people that have Mars in Leo

00:26:57.220 --> 00:26:59.330 align:middle line:84%
have a natural authority
with that Mars.

00:26:59.330 --> 00:27:01.080 align:middle line:84%
And more often than
not, people will

00:27:01.080 --> 00:27:04.607 align:middle line:84%
do what they're being
told to do or asked to do.

00:27:04.607 --> 00:27:06.440 align:middle line:84%
It's kind of the royal
"I" with Mars in Leo,

00:27:06.440 --> 00:27:08.140 align:middle line:90%
but not so with Mars in Virgo.

00:27:08.140 --> 00:27:09.750 align:middle line:90%
And there's a reason why.

00:27:09.750 --> 00:27:11.830 align:middle line:90%
Because Virgo will deliberate.

00:27:11.830 --> 00:27:17.260 align:middle line:84%
Virgo will try to come up with,
in some ways, either the most

00:27:17.260 --> 00:27:21.020 align:middle line:84%
efficient way to say
something, which might come off

00:27:21.020 --> 00:27:25.580 align:middle line:84%
as incredibly cold or
bossy to some extent,

00:27:25.580 --> 00:27:28.140 align:middle line:84%
or they may deliberate so
much about what they're

00:27:28.140 --> 00:27:32.210 align:middle line:84%
going to say so as not to
create waves that they may not

00:27:32.210 --> 00:27:35.530 align:middle line:84%
be attached to their own
personal expression and will

00:27:35.530 --> 00:27:37.210 align:middle line:90%
as it relates to Mars in Virgo.

00:27:37.210 --> 00:27:41.590 align:middle line:84%
So Mars in Virgo in some
ways needs to take an order

00:27:41.590 --> 00:27:44.330 align:middle line:84%
or needs to take the
lead from somebody else.

00:27:44.330 --> 00:27:46.700 align:middle line:84%
And once they get
that, then they

00:27:46.700 --> 00:27:48.765 align:middle line:84%
can be really good
at what they do.

00:27:48.765 --> 00:27:50.390 align:middle line:84%
You know, you want
to hand the ball off

00:27:50.390 --> 00:27:51.848 align:middle line:84%
to somebody that
has Mars in Virgo,

00:27:51.848 --> 00:27:55.350 align:middle line:84%
and say, "Here, you go do this
because you're good at it.

00:27:55.350 --> 00:27:57.280 align:middle line:84%
You can find a
solution, and you can

00:27:57.280 --> 00:27:59.930 align:middle line:84%
find a solution in the most
efficient way possible."

00:27:59.930 --> 00:28:01.362 align:middle line:90%
So they're better lieutenants.

00:28:01.362 --> 00:28:03.570 align:middle line:84%
People that have Mars in
Virgo are better lieutenants

00:28:03.570 --> 00:28:04.760 align:middle line:90%
than they are generals.

00:28:04.760 --> 00:28:08.040 align:middle line:84%
So if you have Mars in
Virgo, it's not a slight.

00:28:08.040 --> 00:28:10.770 align:middle line:84%
But if you understand the
expression of your energy

00:28:10.770 --> 00:28:14.570 align:middle line:84%
and you have the right funnel
and the right channel for it,

00:28:14.570 --> 00:28:16.670 align:middle line:84%
then you can be a
lot more effective.

00:28:16.670 --> 00:28:21.710 align:middle line:84%
And there's a whole
sort of prescription

00:28:21.710 --> 00:28:24.564 align:middle line:84%
for Mars in each sign and how
that Mars can be expressed.

00:28:24.564 --> 00:28:25.980 align:middle line:84%
So what you want
to do is you want

00:28:25.980 --> 00:28:27.779 align:middle line:84%
to find out where
your Mars is and begin

00:28:27.779 --> 00:28:29.570 align:middle line:84%
to study it and find
out what house it's in

00:28:29.570 --> 00:28:31.820 align:middle line:84%
and figure out where it's
most natural placement is.

00:28:31.820 --> 00:28:34.130 align:middle line:84%
And when you do that,
just follow your Mars

00:28:34.130 --> 00:28:35.410 align:middle line:90%
and you'll be fine.

00:28:35.410 --> 00:28:38.060 align:middle line:90%
Trust me on this.

00:28:38.060 --> 00:28:41.620 align:middle line:84%
Mars can be complex as it is
expressed through the water

00:28:41.620 --> 00:28:42.120 align:middle line:90%
signs.

00:28:42.120 --> 00:28:42.610 align:middle line:90%
This is true.

00:28:42.610 --> 00:28:45.193 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to do a little bit of
a breakdown through Mars here.

00:28:45.193 --> 00:28:47.580 align:middle line:84%
So we have Mars, which
is a fire planet.

00:28:47.580 --> 00:28:50.210 align:middle line:84%
And when you put it in
context with a water sign--

00:28:50.210 --> 00:28:53.190 align:middle line:84%
with the exception of
Scorpio, by the way--

00:28:53.190 --> 00:28:54.530 align:middle line:90%
it can be challenging.

00:28:54.530 --> 00:28:55.270 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:28:55.270 --> 00:28:56.960 align:middle line:84%
Mars in Cancer can
be challenging.

00:28:56.960 --> 00:28:58.910 align:middle line:90%
Cancer is receptive.

00:28:58.910 --> 00:29:00.410 align:middle line:90%
Cancer is nurturing.

00:29:00.410 --> 00:29:01.560 align:middle line:90%
Cancer moves backwards.

00:29:01.560 --> 00:29:02.770 align:middle line:90%
Cancer moves sideways.

00:29:02.770 --> 00:29:04.150 align:middle line:90%
Mars moves straight ahead.

00:29:04.150 --> 00:29:04.650 align:middle line:90%
All right.

00:29:04.650 --> 00:29:08.460 align:middle line:84%
So when we have Mars in
Cancer, unless the individual

00:29:08.460 --> 00:29:12.210 align:middle line:84%
understands how to work
with that receptive energy

00:29:12.210 --> 00:29:14.960 align:middle line:84%
and then channel it
back out through Mars,

00:29:14.960 --> 00:29:17.540 align:middle line:90%
then they could be challenged.

00:29:17.540 --> 00:29:19.660 align:middle line:84%
Because if they
try to be active,

00:29:19.660 --> 00:29:24.530 align:middle line:84%
if they try to be sort of
affixed and willful-- like Mars

00:29:24.530 --> 00:29:29.690 align:middle line:84%
in Leo or even Mars in
Scorpio to a certain extent--

00:29:29.690 --> 00:29:31.720 align:middle line:84%
they won't be
really as effective.

00:29:31.720 --> 00:29:35.110 align:middle line:84%
Mars in Pisces can
be very, very poetic.

00:29:35.110 --> 00:29:39.190 align:middle line:84%
And if that Mars is in the
service of art or music

00:29:39.190 --> 00:29:45.240 align:middle line:84%
or in some kind of intense
quest for personal or religious

00:29:45.240 --> 00:29:49.270 align:middle line:84%
or spiritual exploration and
discovery and revelation,

00:29:49.270 --> 00:29:51.890 align:middle line:84%
epiphany, then that
Mars can be challenged.

00:29:51.890 --> 00:29:54.000 align:middle line:84%
A person with Mars in
Pisces, by the way,

00:29:54.000 --> 00:29:55.700 align:middle line:90%
wants to stay away from alcohol.

00:29:55.700 --> 00:29:59.040 align:middle line:84%
It's kind of a common theme
in astrology-- or drugs,

00:29:59.040 --> 00:30:00.590 align:middle line:90%
in general.

00:30:00.590 --> 00:30:03.460 align:middle line:84%
And Mars in Scorpio,
which is a water sign.

00:30:03.460 --> 00:30:06.780 align:middle line:84%
Now, Scorpio's ruler at
one point in time was Mars.

00:30:06.780 --> 00:30:09.800 align:middle line:84%
But once they found Pluto,
they shipped it off to Pluto.

00:30:09.800 --> 00:30:12.070 align:middle line:84%
So it's got a natural
placement with Mars.

00:30:12.070 --> 00:30:13.520 align:middle line:90%
Scorpio's intense.

00:30:13.520 --> 00:30:14.265 align:middle line:90%
Mars is intense.

00:30:14.265 --> 00:30:15.370 align:middle line:90%
They like each other.

00:30:15.370 --> 00:30:19.070 align:middle line:84%
So that's the one water
sign where it works.

00:30:19.070 --> 00:30:21.867 align:middle line:90%
It's relentless in earth signs.

00:30:21.867 --> 00:30:24.450 align:middle line:84%
It can be strident, rebellious,
and restless in the air signs.

00:30:24.450 --> 00:30:25.780 align:middle line:90%
So Mars and the earth signs.

00:30:25.780 --> 00:30:26.930 align:middle line:90%
We talked about Virgo.

00:30:26.930 --> 00:30:29.820 align:middle line:84%
Mars in Capricorn, that's
a great placement for Mars.

00:30:29.820 --> 00:30:32.680 align:middle line:84%
And Mars in Taurus is a
little bit on the slow side.

00:30:32.680 --> 00:30:35.430 align:middle line:84%
Mars in Taurus is like the
tortoise versus the hare.

00:30:35.430 --> 00:30:37.740 align:middle line:84%
Of course, the hare, sort
of the tortoise being

00:30:37.740 --> 00:30:39.210 align:middle line:90%
Mars in Mars in Taurus.

00:30:39.210 --> 00:30:39.730 align:middle line:90%
All right.

00:30:39.730 --> 00:30:42.100 align:middle line:84%
In air signs, it can be
very dynamic, but also

00:30:42.100 --> 00:30:45.220 align:middle line:84%
quite strident-- especially when
we talk about Mars in Libra,

00:30:45.220 --> 00:30:47.070 align:middle line:90%
which we will in a second.

00:30:47.070 --> 00:30:49.600 align:middle line:84%
When it's at home
in fire, Mars, it

00:30:49.600 --> 00:30:51.900 align:middle line:84%
has a natural and
unaffected position.

00:30:51.900 --> 00:30:52.620 align:middle line:90%
Mars in Aries.

00:30:52.620 --> 00:30:54.180 align:middle line:90%
Mars in Sagittarius.

00:30:54.180 --> 00:30:55.760 align:middle line:90%
And Mars in Leo.

00:30:55.760 --> 00:30:57.030 align:middle line:90%
Mars loves those fire signs.

00:30:57.030 --> 00:30:59.920 align:middle line:84%
And if you have Mars in a fire
sign, consider yourself lucky.

00:30:59.920 --> 00:31:01.600 align:middle line:84%
You've got a great
placement from Mars,

00:31:01.600 --> 00:31:04.540 align:middle line:84%
and you can direct your
will quite easily here

00:31:04.540 --> 00:31:06.380 align:middle line:90%
in this third-dimensional plane.

00:31:06.380 --> 00:31:09.270 align:middle line:84%
Mars is also a key indicator of
sexual expression in the chart.

00:31:09.270 --> 00:31:12.650 align:middle line:84%
An afflicted Mars can
indicate a blocked flow

00:31:12.650 --> 00:31:14.580 align:middle line:90%
with sexual and creative energy.

00:31:14.580 --> 00:31:17.590 align:middle line:84%
What I mean by that is,
is if your Mars is square

00:31:17.590 --> 00:31:20.470 align:middle line:84%
to certain planets or
if your Mars is opposed

00:31:20.470 --> 00:31:23.690 align:middle line:84%
to certain planets or
if there's a conjunction

00:31:23.690 --> 00:31:27.050 align:middle line:84%
with certain planets, depending
upon what those planets are

00:31:27.050 --> 00:31:29.354 align:middle line:84%
and the aspect, your
Mars can be afflicted.

00:31:29.354 --> 00:31:31.270 align:middle line:84%
For instance, let's say
you have Mars conjunct

00:31:31.270 --> 00:31:32.650 align:middle line:90%
Neptune in your chart.

00:31:32.650 --> 00:31:35.530 align:middle line:84%
So you have this dynamic
kind of Mars energy,

00:31:35.530 --> 00:31:38.040 align:middle line:84%
but then, there's
Neptune, which is Piscean.

00:31:38.040 --> 00:31:40.240 align:middle line:90%
It's deep.

00:31:40.240 --> 00:31:41.510 align:middle line:90%
It's oceanic.

00:31:41.510 --> 00:31:42.890 align:middle line:90%
It's mystical.

00:31:42.890 --> 00:31:44.765 align:middle line:84%
The two don't really
work very well together.

00:31:44.765 --> 00:31:48.850 align:middle line:84%
And so Neptune can
dissipate that Mars energy.

00:31:48.850 --> 00:31:51.950 align:middle line:84%
So by understanding,
you know, not just

00:31:51.950 --> 00:31:54.310 align:middle line:84%
where Mars is in your
chart but also what

00:31:54.310 --> 00:31:56.050 align:middle line:90%
other planets are doing with it.

00:31:56.050 --> 00:32:00.380 align:middle line:84%
You can begin to diagnose your
own energy, your own passion,

00:32:00.380 --> 00:32:05.310 align:middle line:84%
and your own signal as it
relates to your personal will.

00:32:05.310 --> 00:32:08.390 align:middle line:84%
Now, we are currently
in a phase and cycle

00:32:08.390 --> 00:32:09.910 align:middle line:90%
where Mars is in Libra.

00:32:09.910 --> 00:32:11.930 align:middle line:84%
I talked about this
a little bit earlier.

00:32:11.930 --> 00:32:15.120 align:middle line:84%
So some of the things that we're
going to be seeing culturally

00:32:15.120 --> 00:32:19.110 align:middle line:84%
with Mars in Libra until it
transits out of Libra in June

00:32:19.110 --> 00:32:22.220 align:middle line:84%
is that we're going
to see kind of more

00:32:22.220 --> 00:32:27.000 align:middle line:84%
of a call towards human
rights, human expression,

00:32:27.000 --> 00:32:31.040 align:middle line:84%
the expression of
the human spirit

00:32:31.040 --> 00:32:37.740 align:middle line:84%
as this sort of beacon
of liberty and equality

00:32:37.740 --> 00:32:38.510 align:middle line:90%
and balance.

00:32:38.510 --> 00:32:41.240 align:middle line:84%
And all those things
that we would associate

00:32:41.240 --> 00:32:44.525 align:middle line:84%
with the sign of Libra, they
become very active with Mars.

00:32:44.525 --> 00:32:45.920 align:middle line:90%
And Mars is retrograde now.

00:32:45.920 --> 00:32:48.050 align:middle line:84%
So let's go back
in time and look

00:32:48.050 --> 00:32:51.970 align:middle line:84%
at some individuals who
had or have Mars in Libra.

00:32:51.970 --> 00:32:54.150 align:middle line:84%
Here we have John
Lennon, who has Mars.

00:32:54.150 --> 00:32:55.870 align:middle line:84%
Now, he's got
Mercury in Scorpio.

00:32:55.870 --> 00:32:57.290 align:middle line:90%
Can you see those Scorpio eyes?

00:32:57.290 --> 00:32:58.580 align:middle line:90%
He totally has it.

00:32:58.580 --> 00:32:59.900 align:middle line:90%
But Lennon was an activist.

00:32:59.900 --> 00:33:01.170 align:middle line:90%
He had Mars in Libra.

00:33:01.170 --> 00:33:05.190 align:middle line:84%
And when did his activism
become activated?

00:33:05.190 --> 00:33:06.480 align:middle line:90%
When he met Yoko Ono.

00:33:06.480 --> 00:33:11.370 align:middle line:84%
So he needed that other in order
to activate that Mars in Libra.

00:33:11.370 --> 00:33:14.700 align:middle line:84%
And of course, one of their
great activist moments

00:33:14.700 --> 00:33:18.830 align:middle line:84%
was when they were protesting
the war from a bed in Toronto.

00:33:18.830 --> 00:33:20.671 align:middle line:90%
Very Mars, kind of Libra deal.

00:33:20.671 --> 00:33:21.170 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:33:21.170 --> 00:33:23.840 align:middle line:84%
With two people in
bed hanging out,

00:33:23.840 --> 00:33:27.180 align:middle line:84%
talking to all these interesting
people, including Al Capp.

00:33:27.180 --> 00:33:31.410 align:middle line:84%
If you haven't seen the movie
about John Lennon and his time

00:33:31.410 --> 00:33:35.610 align:middle line:84%
in Canada, it's
worth checking out.

00:33:35.610 --> 00:33:36.430 align:middle line:90%
Abraham Lincoln.

00:33:36.430 --> 00:33:36.930 align:middle line:90%
See?

00:33:36.930 --> 00:33:37.854 align:middle line:90%
Mars needs a cause.

00:33:37.854 --> 00:33:39.020 align:middle line:90%
That's the other thing here.

00:33:39.020 --> 00:33:40.990 align:middle line:90%
Mars in Libra needs a cause.

00:33:40.990 --> 00:33:43.841 align:middle line:84%
And John Lennon found a
cause, "Give peace a chance."

00:33:43.841 --> 00:33:44.340 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:33:44.340 --> 00:33:46.730 align:middle line:90%
He was a peace radical.

00:33:46.730 --> 00:33:51.440 align:middle line:84%
He was active around this
whole notion of world peace.

00:33:51.440 --> 00:33:53.650 align:middle line:90%
Abraham Lincoln had a cause.

00:33:53.650 --> 00:33:54.650 align:middle line:90%
It was called "slavery."

00:33:54.650 --> 00:33:56.355 align:middle line:84%
It's called the
"abolition of slavery."

00:33:56.355 --> 00:34:03.010 align:middle line:84%
He's an Aquarius, but he found
a active placement for his Mars.

00:34:03.010 --> 00:34:05.940 align:middle line:84%
In fact, it was an epic
and historical placement

00:34:05.940 --> 00:34:07.210 align:middle line:90%
for his Mars.

00:34:07.210 --> 00:34:11.429 align:middle line:84%
So Mars in Libra actually
work for Abraham Lincoln.

00:34:11.429 --> 00:34:13.300 align:middle line:84%
And it worked for
many other people,

00:34:13.300 --> 00:34:16.540 align:middle line:90%
including this country as well.

00:34:16.540 --> 00:34:18.880 align:middle line:84%
Here's another guy with Mars
in Libra-- a little more

00:34:18.880 --> 00:34:21.280 align:middle line:90%
contemporary-- Bill Gates.

00:34:21.280 --> 00:34:23.830 align:middle line:84%
And if you've noticed
or found or followed

00:34:23.830 --> 00:34:28.544 align:middle line:84%
Bill Gates in his
post-Microsoft world and legacy,

00:34:28.544 --> 00:34:29.460 align:middle line:90%
what's he involved in?

00:34:29.460 --> 00:34:31.219 align:middle line:84%
He's involved in
nothing but causes.

00:34:31.219 --> 00:34:34.460 align:middle line:84%
He's got the Bill &
Linda Gates Foundation.

00:34:34.460 --> 00:34:38.030 align:middle line:84%
He's putting seeds-- Bill
Gates is the largest seed

00:34:38.030 --> 00:34:42.250 align:middle line:84%
bank in the world in
Greenland, by the way.

00:34:42.250 --> 00:34:43.570 align:middle line:90%
That's a cause, I suppose.

00:34:43.570 --> 00:34:47.020 align:middle line:84%
He's also very into
vaccines, and he's

00:34:47.020 --> 00:34:50.330 align:middle line:84%
very into inoculating
Africa and making sure

00:34:50.330 --> 00:34:52.850 align:middle line:90%
that Africa is malaria-free.

00:34:52.850 --> 00:34:55.260 align:middle line:84%
And unfortunately,
some of the vaccines

00:34:55.260 --> 00:34:57.870 align:middle line:84%
that the Gates Foundation
has used in Africa

00:34:57.870 --> 00:34:59.250 align:middle line:90%
haven't done too well.

00:34:59.250 --> 00:35:02.010 align:middle line:90%
But obviously, he has a cause.

00:35:02.010 --> 00:35:02.510 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:35:02.510 --> 00:35:03.790 align:middle line:90%
Mars in Libra.

00:35:03.790 --> 00:35:06.720 align:middle line:84%
By the way, Bill
Gates' father was

00:35:06.720 --> 00:35:09.580 align:middle line:84%
on the board of
Planned Parenthood

00:35:09.580 --> 00:35:11.666 align:middle line:84%
as well as being an
executive for Boeing.

00:35:11.666 --> 00:35:13.040 align:middle line:84%
And of course,
Planned Parenthood

00:35:13.040 --> 00:35:15.530 align:middle line:90%
started by Margaret Sanger.

00:35:15.530 --> 00:35:18.450 align:middle line:84%
And Margaret Sanger has
some very interesting things

00:35:18.450 --> 00:35:23.440 align:middle line:84%
to say about different races
and the eugenic superiority

00:35:23.440 --> 00:35:24.106 align:middle line:90%
of other races.

00:35:24.106 --> 00:35:25.480 align:middle line:84%
So this is kind
of part-- I'm not

00:35:25.480 --> 00:35:26.730 align:middle line:90%
saying that he's a eugenicist.

00:35:26.730 --> 00:35:29.185 align:middle line:84%
However, when we get
into vaccines in Africa,

00:35:29.185 --> 00:35:30.875 align:middle line:84%
it gets a little--
the conversation

00:35:30.875 --> 00:35:31.780 align:middle line:90%
gets a little tricky.

00:35:31.780 --> 00:35:33.820 align:middle line:90%
Doesn't it?

00:35:33.820 --> 00:35:37.550 align:middle line:84%
Speaking of Africa,
Nelson Mandela.

00:35:37.550 --> 00:35:38.410 align:middle line:90%
Mars in Libra.

00:35:38.410 --> 00:35:38.910 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:35:38.910 --> 00:35:41.060 align:middle line:90%
He had a cause-- in his own way.

00:35:41.060 --> 00:35:43.130 align:middle line:90%
Now, a controversial figure.

00:35:43.130 --> 00:35:48.420 align:middle line:84%
There is the Mandela who
is the hero of human rights

00:35:48.420 --> 00:35:51.651 align:middle line:84%
and the spirit of freedom,
liberation, suffering.

00:35:51.651 --> 00:35:52.150 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:35:52.150 --> 00:35:54.150 align:middle line:84%
Then, there's another
side of Mandela,

00:35:54.150 --> 00:35:58.540 align:middle line:84%
which some historians
say is quite

00:35:58.540 --> 00:36:02.860 align:middle line:84%
intense and angry and violent
and even borders on terrorism.

00:36:02.860 --> 00:36:06.470 align:middle line:84%
So that would also indicate this
Mars in Libra kind of dynamic.

00:36:06.470 --> 00:36:06.970 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:36:06.970 --> 00:36:09.340 align:middle line:84%
There's the liberator, and
then there's the terrorist.

00:36:09.340 --> 00:36:11.380 align:middle line:84%
That's Mars in Libra
getting worked out.

00:36:11.380 --> 00:36:13.660 align:middle line:90%
So he had Mars and Libra.

00:36:13.660 --> 00:36:17.230 align:middle line:84%
And another person with
Mars in Libra was Tesla.

00:36:17.230 --> 00:36:18.880 align:middle line:90%
And what was Tesla trying to do?

00:36:18.880 --> 00:36:23.840 align:middle line:84%
Tesla was trying to balance
and level the playing field.

00:36:23.840 --> 00:36:25.320 align:middle line:90%
He wanted to bring free energy.

00:36:25.320 --> 00:36:29.010 align:middle line:84%
In fact, he did bring
free energy to the planet.

00:36:29.010 --> 00:36:34.420 align:middle line:84%
So he has this legacy
with his Mars in Libra.

00:36:34.420 --> 00:36:38.550 align:middle line:84%
He basically wanted to be a
kind of a technological steward

00:36:38.550 --> 00:36:41.900 align:middle line:90%
and balance everything out.

00:36:41.900 --> 00:36:42.510 align:middle line:90%
And he did.

00:36:42.510 --> 00:36:45.150 align:middle line:84%
And unfortunately,
his technology

00:36:45.150 --> 00:36:47.980 align:middle line:84%
has been used--
instead of peace,

00:36:47.980 --> 00:36:51.690 align:middle line:84%
which would be one aspect
of the scale of Libra--

00:36:51.690 --> 00:36:56.340 align:middle line:84%
his technology has been used
in the application of war.

00:36:56.340 --> 00:37:00.360 align:middle line:84%
And in fact, his technology has
been transferred into the HAARP

00:37:00.360 --> 00:37:03.780 align:middle line:84%
technologies, which are
all over the planet.

00:37:03.780 --> 00:37:05.590 align:middle line:84%
Tesla technology
and, of course, what

00:37:05.590 --> 00:37:08.020 align:middle line:84%
we are experiencing with
the HAARP technology

00:37:08.020 --> 00:37:11.070 align:middle line:84%
is weather wars,
which, unfortunately,

00:37:11.070 --> 00:37:14.660 align:middle line:84%
are trying to balance our planet
in terms of this whole climate

00:37:14.660 --> 00:37:15.160 align:middle line:90%
change.

00:37:15.160 --> 00:37:18.680 align:middle line:84%
By the way, if haven't found
Dane Wigington and his work

00:37:18.680 --> 00:37:22.100 align:middle line:84%
on climate change
and geoengineering

00:37:22.100 --> 00:37:24.860 align:middle line:84%
and aerosol spraying
of the atmosphere,

00:37:24.860 --> 00:37:26.580 align:middle line:90%
I highly recommend it.

00:37:26.580 --> 00:37:29.690 align:middle line:84%
Because here, we have another
Mars in Libra kind of thing

00:37:29.690 --> 00:37:33.440 align:middle line:84%
where they're applying
this cloud cover in order

00:37:33.440 --> 00:37:39.310 align:middle line:84%
to change or stem the climate
crisis that we're dealing with,

00:37:39.310 --> 00:37:41.860 align:middle line:84%
while, at the same time, they're
exacerbating it and making

00:37:41.860 --> 00:37:42.690 align:middle line:90%
it worse.

00:37:42.690 --> 00:37:46.250 align:middle line:84%
It's a whole 'nother
Mars in Libra thing.

00:37:46.250 --> 00:37:47.932 align:middle line:84%
Well, I think that
just about does it.

00:37:47.932 --> 00:37:49.890 align:middle line:84%
We've looked at the
feminine and the masculine,

00:37:49.890 --> 00:37:54.160 align:middle line:84%
Venus and Mars, and how it
impacts our relationships, how

00:37:54.160 --> 00:37:56.310 align:middle line:84%
it impacts our energy,
and I've given you

00:37:56.310 --> 00:38:00.275 align:middle line:84%
some contemporary, current
and also past examples

00:38:00.275 --> 00:38:01.610 align:middle line:90%
of how this has played out.

00:38:01.610 --> 00:38:03.840 align:middle line:84%
And we'll do more
of this hopefully

00:38:03.840 --> 00:38:06.430 align:middle line:84%
as we do more shows inside
"The Eleventh House."

00:38:06.430 --> 00:38:08.930 align:middle line:84%
We'll get into the nuts
and bolts of astrology.

00:38:08.930 --> 00:38:10.820 align:middle line:10%
And hopefully, you can
take some of this back

00:38:10.820 --> 00:38:12.530 align:middle line:10%
and apply it to your own life.

00:38:12.530 --> 00:38:14.220 align:middle line:10%
But until then, this
is Robert Phoenix.

00:38:14.220 --> 00:38:15.500 align:middle line:10%
Thank you for joining me.

00:38:15.500 --> 00:38:17.345 align:middle line:10%
It's always a pleasure to be
here with you in "The Eleventh

00:38:17.345 --> 00:38:17.845 align:middle line:10%
House."

00:38:17.845 --> 00:38:20.020 align:middle line:90%
And until next time, take care.

00:38:20.020 --> 00:38:30.634 align:middle line:90%
