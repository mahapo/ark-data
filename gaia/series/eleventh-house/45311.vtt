00:00:16.659 --> 00:00:18.950 align:middle line:84%
>>ROBERT PHOENIX: Welcome
back to "The Eleventh House."

00:00:18.950 --> 00:00:21.150 align:middle line:84%
This is Robert
Phoenix, and today we

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:24.640 align:middle line:84%
are going to revisit the
scene of the crime, the scene

00:00:24.640 --> 00:00:27.280 align:middle line:84%
of the crime for the 20th
and even 21st century.

00:00:27.280 --> 00:00:29.540 align:middle line:84%
And I'm talking about
the Babalon Working,

00:00:29.540 --> 00:00:33.990 align:middle line:84%
the magical occult operation
performed by Jack Parsons, L.

00:00:33.990 --> 00:00:36.135 align:middle line:84%
Ron Hubbard, and
Marjorie Cameron.

00:00:36.135 --> 00:00:38.010 align:middle line:84%
So in this episode,
we're going to be looking

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:41.620 align:middle line:84%
at specifically the
Babalon Working itself,

00:00:41.620 --> 00:00:44.630 align:middle line:84%
but also what I would call
the hologrammatic cinematrix

00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:48.150 align:middle line:84%
and how this gets played out in
film, in television, and even

00:00:48.150 --> 00:00:51.866 align:middle line:84%
sports, especially as it
relates to Super Bowl XLVIII.

00:00:51.866 --> 00:00:54.240 align:middle line:84%
We're going to get into that
as we move through the show.

00:00:54.240 --> 00:00:56.609 align:middle line:84%
Today the sun is in Aquarius,
the moon is in Libra,

00:00:56.609 --> 00:00:58.400 align:middle line:84%
and I hope you have a
positive and harmonic

00:00:58.400 --> 00:01:02.600 align:middle line:84%
and balanced experience for
the next 30-plus minutes.

00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:04.450 align:middle line:84%
So let's just jump
right into this.

00:01:04.450 --> 00:01:05.200 align:middle line:90%
So here we go.

00:01:05.200 --> 00:01:06.820 align:middle line:84%
Let's just reintroduce
or characters,

00:01:06.820 --> 00:01:08.610 align:middle line:90%
Babalon Working part two.

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:11.230 align:middle line:84%
Liber 49-- that
is the name, that

00:01:11.230 --> 00:01:13.950 align:middle line:84%
is the magical name of
the Babalon Working.

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:18.760 align:middle line:84%
And it took place between
January, February, March, 1946,

00:01:18.760 --> 00:01:21.850 align:middle line:84%
a year before the death
of Alastair Crowley, who

00:01:21.850 --> 00:01:25.800 align:middle line:84%
was the spiritual mentor of
one Jack Parsons, the rocket

00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:29.800 align:middle line:84%
scientist, the mad genius of
Jet Propulsion Laboratories.

00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:34.180 align:middle line:84%
Marjorie Cameron
slash Betty, his wife.

00:01:34.180 --> 00:01:37.350 align:middle line:84%
And then, of course,
Captain L. Ron Hubbard.

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:40.650 align:middle line:84%
Now if you missed the
first part of this,

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:42.750 align:middle line:84%
Jack Parsons and
L. Ron Hubbard met

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:44.900 align:middle line:90%
while they were in the Navy.

00:01:44.900 --> 00:01:47.090 align:middle line:84%
And L. Ron Hubbard was
Naval Intelligence.

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:49.720 align:middle line:84%
He was told to watch Jack
Parsons because Jack Parsons

00:01:49.720 --> 00:01:52.160 align:middle line:84%
was an interesting
character involved

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:54.980 align:middle line:84%
in some very
interesting activities.

00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:59.500 align:middle line:84%
And L. Ron Hubbard decided to
become more than just a spy

00:01:59.500 --> 00:02:00.815 align:middle line:90%
friend, so to speak.

00:02:00.815 --> 00:02:05.730 align:middle line:84%
He became an actual friend,
and occult apprentice,

00:02:05.730 --> 00:02:06.730 align:middle line:90%
in some ways.

00:02:06.730 --> 00:02:08.949 align:middle line:84%
But over the course
of their relationship,

00:02:08.949 --> 00:02:11.640 align:middle line:84%
Hubbard actually takes over
and becomes the alpha male

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:13.220 align:middle line:90%
in this trinity.

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:16.170 align:middle line:84%
And Marjorie Cameron
will, at the end of this,

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:20.680 align:middle line:84%
leave Jack Parsons, go
with Ron Hubbard to Florida

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:24.370 align:middle line:84%
from California, where Ron
Hubbard will buy a yacht

00:02:24.370 --> 00:02:26.750 align:middle line:84%
and will begin "Dianetics"
and then Scientology.

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:28.900 align:middle line:90%
That's where it all starts.

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:31.920 align:middle line:84%
And she's at the
ground floor with him.

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:33.390 align:middle line:84%
So one of the things
that we talked

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:35.080 align:middle line:84%
about in the first
episode of this

00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:40.310 align:middle line:84%
was the whole notion that what
Hubbard and Cameron and Parsons

00:02:40.310 --> 00:02:44.540 align:middle line:84%
were doing is they were invoking
what's called a moonlet,

00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:45.807 align:middle line:90%
or the spirit of the Goddess.

00:02:45.807 --> 00:02:47.390 align:middle line:84%
And what they were
really trying to do

00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:51.140 align:middle line:84%
is they were trying to bring the
Goddess into the 20th century,

00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:54.940 align:middle line:84%
because they were tired of the
male patriarchal dominating

00:02:54.940 --> 00:02:56.040 align:middle line:90%
culture.

00:02:56.040 --> 00:02:58.860 align:middle line:84%
And they wanted to reinsert
the energy of the Goddess

00:02:58.860 --> 00:03:00.900 align:middle line:90%
into the 20th century.

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:04.560 align:middle line:84%
And I think they were probably
successful at doing this.

00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:06.710 align:middle line:84%
And as a result
of this, there is

00:03:06.710 --> 00:03:12.100 align:middle line:84%
a major infusion of imagery
in the 20th century, in film

00:03:12.100 --> 00:03:15.780 align:middle line:84%
and television, of the Scarlet
Woman, or the Lady in Red.

00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:18.780 align:middle line:84%
And in the first episode, we
looked at a number of examples,

00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:22.446 align:middle line:84%
from Marilyn Monroe to Christina
Hendricks in "Mad Men."

00:03:22.446 --> 00:03:24.320 align:middle line:84%
And I've got a few more
I wanted to add here.

00:03:24.320 --> 00:03:26.510 align:middle line:84%
This is Elizabeth
Ronson, and she

00:03:26.510 --> 00:03:29.220 align:middle line:84%
is appearing in the
new "Avengers" movie.

00:03:29.220 --> 00:03:31.900 align:middle line:84%
It's the followup
to the first one.

00:03:31.900 --> 00:03:35.064 align:middle line:84%
And I was just doing
a search online

00:03:35.064 --> 00:03:36.980 align:middle line:84%
because I wanted to
include Scarlet the Witch.

00:03:36.980 --> 00:03:39.180 align:middle line:84%
I wasn't aware of the
fact that she's actually

00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:40.290 align:middle line:90%
going to be in the movie.

00:03:40.290 --> 00:03:42.400 align:middle line:84%
And she's, I gotta tell
you, an incredible upgrade

00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:45.060 align:middle line:84%
from the Scarlet the Witch
that I knew as a kid.

00:03:45.060 --> 00:03:49.150 align:middle line:84%
So there she is in
all of her red glory,

00:03:49.150 --> 00:03:50.980 align:middle line:90%
and she's another manifestation.

00:03:50.980 --> 00:03:54.540 align:middle line:84%
She's a magical manifestation
of the Lady in Red,

00:03:54.540 --> 00:03:57.250 align:middle line:84%
who is the moonlet, who is
the spirit of Babalon-- known

00:03:57.250 --> 00:03:59.480 align:middle line:84%
as mystery, by the way, in
the Book of Revelations,

00:03:59.480 --> 00:04:02.480 align:middle line:84%
but also the, quote
unquote, "Whore of Babalon."

00:04:02.480 --> 00:04:05.630 align:middle line:84%
So I actually stumbled
across another website,

00:04:05.630 --> 00:04:07.770 align:middle line:84%
which is quite
interesting as well.

00:04:07.770 --> 00:04:11.740 align:middle line:84%
The person who downloaded this
information is Anton Parks.

00:04:11.740 --> 00:04:13.150 align:middle line:90%
Remember that name.

00:04:13.150 --> 00:04:15.300 align:middle line:90%
Go look it up on the internet.

00:04:15.300 --> 00:04:16.320 align:middle line:90%
You will be blown away.

00:04:16.320 --> 00:04:19.370 align:middle line:84%
And what you'll find there
is a very explicit and very

00:04:19.370 --> 00:04:23.430 align:middle line:84%
detail-oriented of
Earth's prehistory, that

00:04:23.430 --> 00:04:27.060 align:middle line:84%
gets into the planetary
wars, the planet

00:04:27.060 --> 00:04:29.560 align:middle line:90%
Marduk-- it'll blow your mind.

00:04:29.560 --> 00:04:32.490 align:middle line:84%
And one of the things that
I saw was a complete kind

00:04:32.490 --> 00:04:35.090 align:middle line:84%
of spiritual hierarchy
of what took place

00:04:35.090 --> 00:04:37.942 align:middle line:90%
on Earth, the seeding of Earth.

00:04:37.942 --> 00:04:39.650 align:middle line:84%
It's kind of in L.
Ron Hubbard territory,

00:04:39.650 --> 00:04:41.090 align:middle line:84%
to be honest with
you-- maybe Parks

00:04:41.090 --> 00:04:42.631 align:middle line:84%
should have started
his own religion.

00:04:42.631 --> 00:04:45.960 align:middle line:84%
But what I found was
the potential, sort

00:04:45.960 --> 00:04:48.100 align:middle line:84%
of the archetypal
and cosmic potential,

00:04:48.100 --> 00:04:52.380 align:middle line:84%
of what the spirits of the
moonlet, or the, quote unquote,

00:04:52.380 --> 00:04:54.570 align:middle line:84%
"Whore of Bablon"
might have been.

00:04:54.570 --> 00:04:58.250 align:middle line:84%
Now they were trying to
channel Babalon/Baby Lion,

00:04:58.250 --> 00:05:02.310 align:middle line:84%
this kind of hybrid
lioness goddess.

00:05:02.310 --> 00:05:05.131 align:middle line:84%
You'll see-- well, you saw
an image in the first show

00:05:05.131 --> 00:05:05.630 align:middle line:90%
about it.

00:05:05.630 --> 00:05:08.497 align:middle line:84%
Head of a woman, body of a
lion, just like the Sphinx.

00:05:08.497 --> 00:05:10.330 align:middle line:84%
That's what they were
attempting to channel.

00:05:10.330 --> 00:05:13.210 align:middle line:84%
But I think that there was an
energy even beyond that, even

00:05:13.210 --> 00:05:15.860 align:middle line:84%
beyond those physical
manifestations that

00:05:15.860 --> 00:05:20.860 align:middle line:84%
were used as statuary in
Egypt and throughout Europe.

00:05:20.860 --> 00:05:23.420 align:middle line:90%
So let's get into this.

00:05:23.420 --> 00:05:25.210 align:middle line:84%
I ask the question,
is she descended

00:05:25.210 --> 00:05:27.850 align:middle line:84%
from a race of beings
called the Kadistu?

00:05:27.850 --> 00:05:29.470 align:middle line:84%
Now Kadistu can be
spelled with a Q

00:05:29.470 --> 00:05:33.390 align:middle line:84%
as well, just like Qabala can be
spelled with a K and also a Q.

00:05:33.390 --> 00:05:36.480 align:middle line:84%
The Kadistu-- this is coming
from Anton Parks's site,

00:05:36.480 --> 00:05:38.110 align:middle line:90%
his material.

00:05:38.110 --> 00:05:41.140 align:middle line:84%
The Kadistu were
high-ranking priestesses.

00:05:41.140 --> 00:05:42.780 align:middle line:90%
Priestesses.

00:05:42.780 --> 00:05:47.900 align:middle line:84%
In Sumerian, they are called
the N-U-G-I-G, the nugig,

00:05:47.900 --> 00:05:49.900 align:middle line:90%
meaning non-evil.

00:05:49.900 --> 00:05:52.690 align:middle line:84%
Now because we live in a
dualistic universe, at least

00:05:52.690 --> 00:05:56.900 align:middle line:84%
on this planet, there is
another side of that story.

00:05:56.900 --> 00:06:01.770 align:middle line:84%
They're also sacred prostitutes
and live in the realm of Angel,

00:06:01.770 --> 00:06:05.140 align:middle line:84%
which is a fairly high
spiritual dimension, which

00:06:05.140 --> 00:06:07.910 align:middle line:84%
is where we get the
word angel from.

00:06:07.910 --> 00:06:10.910 align:middle line:84%
So they are non-evil but
also the image of evil,

00:06:10.910 --> 00:06:16.070 align:middle line:84%
because one of them,
Eve, was supposedly--

00:06:16.070 --> 00:06:18.900 align:middle line:84%
she was supposedly
Kadistu-- was initiated

00:06:18.900 --> 00:06:22.520 align:middle line:84%
into the principle
of evil and good due

00:06:22.520 --> 00:06:23.680 align:middle line:90%
to the sin of the flesh.

00:06:23.680 --> 00:06:27.460 align:middle line:84%
Now the Kadistu rarely
descend into human form,

00:06:27.460 --> 00:06:28.970 align:middle line:90%
and apparently Eve did that.

00:06:28.970 --> 00:06:32.980 align:middle line:84%
So she created this
duality as part

00:06:32.980 --> 00:06:35.980 align:middle line:84%
of not just being
here on this planet,

00:06:35.980 --> 00:06:41.170 align:middle line:84%
but also as being part of
the Kadistu experience.

00:06:41.170 --> 00:06:43.890 align:middle line:84%
So their goal,
ultimately, is to unify

00:06:43.890 --> 00:06:46.150 align:middle line:84%
the species of the
universe, to bring

00:06:46.150 --> 00:06:47.870 align:middle line:84%
the dual and the
non-dual together,

00:06:47.870 --> 00:06:51.260 align:middle line:84%
the evil and the non-evil,
or the non-evil and the evil

00:06:51.260 --> 00:06:52.780 align:middle line:90%
together at the same time.

00:06:52.780 --> 00:06:54.520 align:middle line:84%
So I think-- this
is just my take--

00:06:54.520 --> 00:06:58.220 align:middle line:84%
that this is what Parsons and
L. Ron Hubbard and Marjorie

00:06:58.220 --> 00:06:59.870 align:middle line:84%
Cameron were trying
to get at when

00:06:59.870 --> 00:07:01.770 align:middle line:90%
they were summoning the moonlet.

00:07:01.770 --> 00:07:03.560 align:middle line:90%
OK, here we go.

00:07:03.560 --> 00:07:05.250 align:middle line:84%
There's a new show
called "Believe,"

00:07:05.250 --> 00:07:07.340 align:middle line:84%
and it's being produced
by-- and directed,

00:07:07.340 --> 00:07:12.380 align:middle line:84%
I think-- but mostly produced
by the director of "Gravity."

00:07:12.380 --> 00:07:14.340 align:middle line:90%
His last name is Cuaron.

00:07:14.340 --> 00:07:17.020 align:middle line:84%
And this is a fairly
interesting series,

00:07:17.020 --> 00:07:18.860 align:middle line:90%
or at least the premise is.

00:07:18.860 --> 00:07:23.390 align:middle line:84%
There is a young woman who has
supernatural powers that she

00:07:23.390 --> 00:07:25.320 align:middle line:84%
can't really control
all the time.

00:07:25.320 --> 00:07:27.810 align:middle line:90%
Think "Fifth Element."

00:07:27.810 --> 00:07:31.240 align:middle line:84%
And she has to have
a guardian help

00:07:31.240 --> 00:07:33.707 align:middle line:84%
her get to wherever
she's going, go

00:07:33.707 --> 00:07:35.790 align:middle line:84%
through whatever trials
and tribulations and tests

00:07:35.790 --> 00:07:37.930 align:middle line:84%
that she'll go
through as being kind

00:07:37.930 --> 00:07:40.360 align:middle line:90%
of an untamed force of nature.

00:07:40.360 --> 00:07:41.652 align:middle line:90%
And that's the basic plot line.

00:07:41.652 --> 00:07:43.276 align:middle line:84%
And there are people,
of course, trying

00:07:43.276 --> 00:07:45.540 align:middle line:84%
to get her because she's
the ultimate weapon, right?

00:07:45.540 --> 00:07:50.190 align:middle line:84%
Now I noticed in the
preview for the series

00:07:50.190 --> 00:07:52.850 align:middle line:84%
that she was wearing a
red letterman's jacket.

00:07:52.850 --> 00:07:55.640 align:middle line:84%
So here we have, again,
kind of a younger

00:07:55.640 --> 00:07:58.200 align:middle line:90%
version of the Lady in Red.

00:07:58.200 --> 00:08:01.060 align:middle line:84%
But she also looks
very unisexual here.

00:08:01.060 --> 00:08:04.330 align:middle line:84%
She got a striped shirt
on and baggy jeans.

00:08:04.330 --> 00:08:10.429 align:middle line:84%
And the actress that plays this
young woman is Johnny Sequoyah.

00:08:10.429 --> 00:08:12.470 align:middle line:84%
And I thought that was a
really interesting name.

00:08:12.470 --> 00:08:13.590 align:middle line:90%
It's a very male name.

00:08:13.590 --> 00:08:15.950 align:middle line:84%
That's her name,
Johnny Sequoyah.

00:08:15.950 --> 00:08:20.880 align:middle line:84%
And on the series, on the show,
she plays a character named Bo.

00:08:20.880 --> 00:08:23.100 align:middle line:84%
So she plays a character
that has a male name

00:08:23.100 --> 00:08:24.720 align:middle line:90%
and she also has a male name.

00:08:24.720 --> 00:08:27.990 align:middle line:84%
So now we have this
image of unisexuality.

00:08:27.990 --> 00:08:31.460 align:middle line:84%
And if you go back into,
like, the image of Baphomet

00:08:31.460 --> 00:08:33.940 align:middle line:84%
that some of you might
be familiar with,

00:08:33.940 --> 00:08:38.320 align:middle line:84%
you will see a combination
of a man and a woman

00:08:38.320 --> 00:08:39.700 align:middle line:90%
and a goat, as well.

00:08:39.700 --> 00:08:41.750 align:middle line:84%
The image of
Baphomet has breasts

00:08:41.750 --> 00:08:43.860 align:middle line:84%
and it also has a
male appendage, right?

00:08:43.860 --> 00:08:50.170 align:middle line:84%
So what Baphomet represents
is the resolution of duality.

00:08:50.170 --> 00:08:52.950 align:middle line:84%
It is the consummation
of the male

00:08:52.950 --> 00:08:54.660 align:middle line:90%
and the female in one figure.

00:08:54.660 --> 00:08:58.390 align:middle line:84%
And so what we have here
with Johnny Sequoyah,

00:08:58.390 --> 00:09:03.170 align:middle line:84%
both with her birth name
and her character name,

00:09:03.170 --> 00:09:05.810 align:middle line:84%
is kind of a
combination of the two.

00:09:05.810 --> 00:09:09.200 align:middle line:84%
So she is actually
playing a role here,

00:09:09.200 --> 00:09:12.501 align:middle line:84%
where she is in the series
resolving some form of duality.

00:09:12.501 --> 00:09:13.000 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:16.860 align:middle line:84%
Now Bo is also synonymous
with the bow and the arrow.

00:09:16.860 --> 00:09:19.671 align:middle line:84%
And the bow and the arrow
is a very prominent symbol

00:09:19.671 --> 00:09:21.920 align:middle line:84%
for the Pluto in Sagittarius
generation-- Sagittarius,

00:09:21.920 --> 00:09:23.450 align:middle line:90%
of course, being the centaur.

00:09:23.450 --> 00:09:25.420 align:middle line:84%
And here we have
Katniss Everdeen,

00:09:25.420 --> 00:09:29.520 align:middle line:84%
who is the main character
of "The Hunger Games," who

00:09:29.520 --> 00:09:31.920 align:middle line:84%
uses the bow and
arrow to her advantage

00:09:31.920 --> 00:09:34.640 align:middle line:84%
and her effect to be able to
get through the Hunger Games

00:09:34.640 --> 00:09:36.970 align:middle line:90%
and lead a revolution.

00:09:36.970 --> 00:09:38.870 align:middle line:84%
So here we have
Bo again, and then

00:09:38.870 --> 00:09:42.000 align:middle line:84%
bow here for bow and
arrow, triggering--

00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:45.840 align:middle line:84%
and she's in the Pluto in
Sagittarius generation,

00:09:45.840 --> 00:09:48.030 align:middle line:84%
even though they'll probably
not watch this show.

00:09:48.030 --> 00:09:51.230 align:middle line:84%
But she's part of that
sort of cosmic demographic.

00:09:51.230 --> 00:09:52.230 align:middle line:90%
So that was interesting.

00:09:52.230 --> 00:09:54.590 align:middle line:90%
Wanted to share that with you.

00:09:54.590 --> 00:09:56.290 align:middle line:84%
OK, so let's move on
to the next slide.

00:09:56.290 --> 00:09:58.100 align:middle line:90%
This is part of the cinematrix.

00:09:58.100 --> 00:09:59.710 align:middle line:90%
This is "The Master."

00:09:59.710 --> 00:10:03.490 align:middle line:84%
And this is a film that stars
Joaquin Phoenix and Philip

00:10:03.490 --> 00:10:05.740 align:middle line:84%
Seymour Hoffman-- by the
way, Philip Seymour Hoffman's

00:10:05.740 --> 00:10:09.510 align:middle line:84%
last film was "The Hunger
Games: Catching Fire."

00:10:09.510 --> 00:10:11.500 align:middle line:84%
So there's a tie-in
there, as well.

00:10:11.500 --> 00:10:12.860 align:middle line:90%
And Amy Adams.

00:10:12.860 --> 00:10:16.031 align:middle line:84%
So we have Joaquin Phoenix,
Philip Seymour Hoffman,

00:10:16.031 --> 00:10:16.530 align:middle line:90%
Amy Adams.

00:10:16.530 --> 00:10:21.820 align:middle line:84%
Ostensibly, this is a film about
Jack Parsons, L. Ron Hubbard,

00:10:21.820 --> 00:10:25.570 align:middle line:84%
and Marjorie Cameron,
although it's not

00:10:25.570 --> 00:10:31.440 align:middle line:84%
quite scene for
scene and chapter

00:10:31.440 --> 00:10:35.420 align:middle line:90%
for chapter about their lives.

00:10:35.420 --> 00:10:39.470 align:middle line:84%
But they're characters that
are drawn on their lives,

00:10:39.470 --> 00:10:41.430 align:middle line:84%
especially the part
where they're in the Navy

00:10:41.430 --> 00:10:43.510 align:middle line:84%
and they bond and
they come together

00:10:43.510 --> 00:10:46.790 align:middle line:84%
and they have this kind of
crazy series of interactions

00:10:46.790 --> 00:10:48.290 align:middle line:90%
between the two of them.

00:10:48.290 --> 00:10:50.880 align:middle line:84%
Now Paul Thomas Anderson
is a former Scientologist.

00:10:50.880 --> 00:10:51.720 align:middle line:90%
List.

00:10:51.720 --> 00:10:55.050 align:middle line:84%
So he got into a little bit
of heat doing this movie.

00:10:55.050 --> 00:10:57.910 align:middle line:84%
But this is the framework
for "The Master."

00:10:57.910 --> 00:11:01.980 align:middle line:84%
It is Jack Parsons, L. Ron
Hubbard, and Marjorie Cameron.

00:11:01.980 --> 00:11:03.900 align:middle line:84%
Crowley's goal, who
was Parsons' teacher,

00:11:03.900 --> 00:11:05.370 align:middle line:90%
was to become the phoenix.

00:11:05.370 --> 00:11:06.860 align:middle line:90%
That was his goal, the phoenix.

00:11:06.860 --> 00:11:13.090 align:middle line:84%
And he had achieve his life's
work-- which he did not do.

00:11:13.090 --> 00:11:15.140 align:middle line:90%
It was called Operation Phoenix.

00:11:15.140 --> 00:11:18.520 align:middle line:84%
And he did not do that, so he
never really took that name on.

00:11:18.520 --> 00:11:22.670 align:middle line:84%
But as you'll see through these
slides in the presentation

00:11:22.670 --> 00:11:24.420 align:middle line:84%
and the rest of the
show, the name Phoenix

00:11:24.420 --> 00:11:25.960 align:middle line:90%
is actually quite prominent.

00:11:25.960 --> 00:11:28.470 align:middle line:84%
And one has to wonder
if the spirit of Crowley

00:11:28.470 --> 00:11:32.040 align:middle line:84%
is not really kind of moving
through this whole magical

00:11:32.040 --> 00:11:37.010 align:middle line:84%
operation, even though it's
a non-corporeal presence.

00:11:37.010 --> 00:11:40.290 align:middle line:84%
Keep in mind, this
is Joaquin Phoenix

00:11:40.290 --> 00:11:45.440 align:middle line:84%
playing the Jack
Parsons character.

00:11:45.440 --> 00:11:51.910 align:middle line:84%
So this takes us to Super Bowl
XLIX, which takes place where?

00:11:51.910 --> 00:11:53.340 align:middle line:90%
In Phoenix.

00:11:53.340 --> 00:11:56.180 align:middle line:90%
So Super Bowl XLIX in Phoenix.

00:11:56.180 --> 00:12:00.690 align:middle line:84%
The run-up for Super Bowl
XLIX was Super Bowl XLVIII.

00:12:00.690 --> 00:12:04.230 align:middle line:84%
On the eve of Super
Bowl XLVIII, who dies?

00:12:04.230 --> 00:12:07.525 align:middle line:84%
Philip Seymour Hoffman
as L. Ron Hubbard.

00:12:07.525 --> 00:12:08.061 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:12:08.061 --> 00:12:08.810 align:middle line:90%
Keep that it mind.

00:12:08.810 --> 00:12:11.680 align:middle line:84%
Now what's really
interesting is is

00:12:11.680 --> 00:12:15.500 align:middle line:84%
that there was another
Phoenix that passed away.

00:12:15.500 --> 00:12:20.085 align:middle line:84%
It was not Joaquin
Phoenix, as Jack Parsons,

00:12:20.085 --> 00:12:22.780 align:middle line:84%
but it was his
brother, River Phoenix.

00:12:22.780 --> 00:12:24.450 align:middle line:90%
Now River Phoenix was a Virgo.

00:12:24.450 --> 00:12:28.565 align:middle line:84%
He was born zero degrees Virgo,
the most potent concentration--

00:12:28.565 --> 00:12:32.070 align:middle line:84%
the most pure concentration
of Virgo in some ways.

00:12:32.070 --> 00:12:37.110 align:middle line:84%
And he died on October
31, 1993, on Samhain,

00:12:37.110 --> 00:12:40.030 align:middle line:84%
which is, of course,
a pagan celebration.

00:12:40.030 --> 00:12:41.240 align:middle line:90%
It's usually on November 1.

00:12:41.240 --> 00:12:42.489 align:middle line:90%
We celebrate it here the 31st.

00:12:42.489 --> 00:12:44.170 align:middle line:84%
It's right in the
same time zone.

00:12:44.170 --> 00:12:49.150 align:middle line:84%
Phililp Seymour Hoffman died
on the 1st-- almost in the 2nd,

00:12:49.150 --> 00:12:53.560 align:middle line:84%
right around midnight--
of February 2014.

00:12:53.560 --> 00:12:56.760 align:middle line:84%
And he died on Imbolc, which
is another pagan holiday.

00:12:56.760 --> 00:12:58.190 align:middle line:90%
It's the start of the new year.

00:12:58.190 --> 00:12:59.870 align:middle line:90%
It's the pagan new year.

00:12:59.870 --> 00:13:03.270 align:middle line:84%
So both River Phoenix and
Philip Seymour Hoffman

00:13:03.270 --> 00:13:08.512 align:middle line:84%
die on these two pagan holidays,
these two pagan celebrations,

00:13:08.512 --> 00:13:09.720 align:middle line:90%
these dates of commemoration.

00:13:09.720 --> 00:13:12.900 align:middle line:84%
It's a pretty
interesting coincidence.

00:13:12.900 --> 00:13:16.570 align:middle line:84%
So now River Phoenix had
been shooting a movie

00:13:16.570 --> 00:13:19.385 align:middle line:90%
while he was at the Viper Club.

00:13:19.385 --> 00:13:21.260 align:middle line:84%
He wasn't shooting a
movie at the Viper Club.

00:13:21.260 --> 00:13:23.635 align:middle line:84%
It was during that time and
he had gone to the Viper Club

00:13:23.635 --> 00:13:25.102 align:middle line:90%
while the movie was being shot.

00:13:25.102 --> 00:13:26.560 align:middle line:84%
And it was being
shot here in Utah.

00:13:26.560 --> 00:13:29.900 align:middle line:84%
You can see kind of the
buttes of the Utah landscape

00:13:29.900 --> 00:13:31.160 align:middle line:90%
in the background.

00:13:31.160 --> 00:13:34.040 align:middle line:84%
The name of the movie
was called "Dark Blood."

00:13:34.040 --> 00:13:38.315 align:middle line:84%
And in that movie, he's
part of a love triangle, him

00:13:38.315 --> 00:13:40.440 align:middle line:84%
and Jonathan Pryce
and Judy Davis.

00:13:40.440 --> 00:13:42.920 align:middle line:84%
And it takes place
in the Southwest,

00:13:42.920 --> 00:13:44.940 align:middle line:84%
and he plays a
character called Boy.

00:13:44.940 --> 00:13:46.550 align:middle line:90%
That's his name, Boy.

00:13:46.550 --> 00:13:52.180 align:middle line:84%
And one of his hobbies is to
create kachina and voodoo dolls

00:13:52.180 --> 00:13:54.590 align:middle line:84%
and to put them in
a cave with candles

00:13:54.590 --> 00:13:59.840 align:middle line:84%
and all kinds of other
interesting atmospheric

00:13:59.840 --> 00:14:00.930 align:middle line:90%
additions.

00:14:00.930 --> 00:14:03.620 align:middle line:84%
And he actually performs
magical operations

00:14:03.620 --> 00:14:05.920 align:middle line:84%
on these kachina dolls
and these voodoo dolls.

00:14:05.920 --> 00:14:09.940 align:middle line:84%
And he brings Jonathan Pryce
and he brings Judy Davis down

00:14:09.940 --> 00:14:11.530 align:middle line:90%
into his world.

00:14:11.530 --> 00:14:13.900 align:middle line:84%
But what happens is that the
film turns quite violent,

00:14:13.900 --> 00:14:16.620 align:middle line:84%
and he winds up
dying in the movie,

00:14:16.620 --> 00:14:19.940 align:middle line:84%
just like he dies in
real life, and is engaged

00:14:19.940 --> 00:14:25.670 align:middle line:84%
in this very intense semi-occult
and semi-magical-- certainly

00:14:25.670 --> 00:14:27.110 align:middle line:90%
psychological-- love triangle.

00:14:27.110 --> 00:14:29.510 align:middle line:84%
Now what's really
interesting is is I

00:14:29.510 --> 00:14:32.240 align:middle line:84%
was doing some more
research on this film,

00:14:32.240 --> 00:14:34.078 align:middle line:84%
and just three days
ago, three days

00:14:34.078 --> 00:14:35.702 align:middle line:84%
before I'm standing
right here in front

00:14:35.702 --> 00:14:38.410 align:middle line:84%
of these cameras, the
director of that film,

00:14:38.410 --> 00:14:40.550 align:middle line:84%
George Sluizer,
who's in his 80s,

00:14:40.550 --> 00:14:44.690 align:middle line:84%
has decided to bring the
film out of the ashes.

00:14:44.690 --> 00:14:45.510 align:middle line:90%
"Out of the ashes."

00:14:45.510 --> 00:14:48.450 align:middle line:84%
That's the phraseology
that he used.

00:14:48.450 --> 00:14:51.630 align:middle line:84%
From the ashes of the phoenix,
the film's being resurrected

00:14:51.630 --> 00:14:54.650 align:middle line:84%
and is going to be shown at
a film festival in Edinburgh.

00:14:54.650 --> 00:15:01.400 align:middle line:84%
So now we have River Phoenix
literally rising from the ashes

00:15:01.400 --> 00:15:05.930 align:middle line:84%
just weeks after
Philip Seymour Hoffman

00:15:05.930 --> 00:15:11.060 align:middle line:84%
dies on Imbolc, the
brother of Joaquin Phoenix.

00:15:11.060 --> 00:15:14.770 align:middle line:84%
So if you are interested
in seeing his last film,

00:15:14.770 --> 00:15:17.640 align:middle line:84%
"Dark Blood," I am sure it will
be available here in the United

00:15:17.640 --> 00:15:20.266 align:middle line:90%
States at some point.

00:15:20.266 --> 00:15:21.640 align:middle line:84%
So let's get into
the Super Bowl.

00:15:21.640 --> 00:15:24.250 align:middle line:84%
This is where things
get kind of interesting.

00:15:24.250 --> 00:15:28.770 align:middle line:84%
Philip Seymour Hoffman, he died
33 days after the new year.

00:15:28.770 --> 00:15:30.950 align:middle line:84%
Now we've already
determined that he

00:15:30.950 --> 00:15:33.350 align:middle line:84%
died on Imbolc,
the pagan holiday.

00:15:33.350 --> 00:15:36.080 align:middle line:84%
Super Bowl XLVIII
equals the number 12.

00:15:36.080 --> 00:15:37.510 align:middle line:90%
It's the Hanged Man.

00:15:37.510 --> 00:15:38.720 align:middle line:90%
Remember that.

00:15:38.720 --> 00:15:40.750 align:middle line:90%
Remember Hanged Man.

00:15:40.750 --> 00:15:42.920 align:middle line:84%
The were four people
that were arrested

00:15:42.920 --> 00:15:45.540 align:middle line:84%
in the aftermath of Philip
Seymour Hoffman's death.

00:15:45.540 --> 00:15:49.950 align:middle line:84%
They found 60 bags of
heroin in the office

00:15:49.950 --> 00:15:53.019 align:middle line:84%
that they were shooting
the heroin at and in.

00:15:53.019 --> 00:15:55.060 align:middle line:84%
And one of the people that
was arrested, his name

00:15:55.060 --> 00:15:57.870 align:middle line:84%
is Robert Vineman and
he was a sax player,

00:15:57.870 --> 00:16:00.600 align:middle line:84%
and he played sax
with Amy Winehouse,

00:16:00.600 --> 00:16:03.600 align:middle line:90%
who also died of an overdose.

00:16:03.600 --> 00:16:06.730 align:middle line:84%
And there were three other
people there as well,

00:16:06.730 --> 00:16:09.240 align:middle line:90%
in connection with the 60 bags.

00:16:09.240 --> 00:16:12.190 align:middle line:84%
Now what's interesting is is
that Robert Vineland claims

00:16:12.190 --> 00:16:16.405 align:middle line:84%
that he is being scapegoated,
which is one of the phrases

00:16:16.405 --> 00:16:20.680 align:middle line:84%
and one of the terms
used for the Hanged Man.

00:16:20.680 --> 00:16:23.000 align:middle line:84%
So here we have the
scapegoat and the Hanged Man

00:16:23.000 --> 00:16:24.640 align:middle line:90%
surfacing again.

00:16:24.640 --> 00:16:28.670 align:middle line:84%
David Bar Katz, who was the
person who theoretically found

00:16:28.670 --> 00:16:32.600 align:middle line:84%
Philip Seymour Hoffman,
he has a father.

00:16:32.600 --> 00:16:35.090 align:middle line:84%
His father's name
is Harry Jay Katz.

00:16:35.090 --> 00:16:36.480 align:middle line:90%
Very interesting character.

00:16:36.480 --> 00:16:37.820 align:middle line:90%
You can look him up online.

00:16:37.820 --> 00:16:40.080 align:middle line:84%
You'll be surprised
what you find.

00:16:40.080 --> 00:16:43.020 align:middle line:84%
In 1995, Harry Jay Katz,
David Bar Katz's father--

00:16:43.020 --> 00:16:46.160 align:middle line:84%
remember, David Bar Katz found
Philip Seymour Hoffman dead

00:16:46.160 --> 00:16:48.640 align:middle line:84%
of a heroin overdose,
theoretically found him.

00:16:48.640 --> 00:16:53.090 align:middle line:84%
Harry Jay Katz found his
lover, Pamela Sheridan,

00:16:53.090 --> 00:16:57.130 align:middle line:84%
dead in his hot tub,
ODed on cocaine.

00:16:57.130 --> 00:17:00.500 align:middle line:84%
So now we have a father
who found his girlfriend

00:17:00.500 --> 00:17:02.670 align:middle line:84%
dead in his hot tub
with a drug overdose,

00:17:02.670 --> 00:17:05.829 align:middle line:84%
and we have a son who
found Philip Seymour

00:17:05.829 --> 00:17:08.471 align:middle line:90%
Hoffman dead on a drug overdose.

00:17:08.471 --> 00:17:10.970 align:middle line:84%
And what's really interesting
is Philip Seymour Hoffman died

00:17:10.970 --> 00:17:16.890 align:middle line:84%
in the West Village, just blocks
away from Sheridan Square.

00:17:16.890 --> 00:17:18.810 align:middle line:84%
Via his Twitter
account, David Bar Katz

00:17:18.810 --> 00:17:21.109 align:middle line:84%
speaks openly about his
fondness for Crowley

00:17:21.109 --> 00:17:24.427 align:middle line:84%
with actor, friend, and
fellow cultist Yul Vazquez.

00:17:24.427 --> 00:17:26.510 align:middle line:84%
I don't know if his Twitter
account is still open,

00:17:26.510 --> 00:17:27.514 align:middle line:90%
but it was.

00:17:27.514 --> 00:17:28.680 align:middle line:90%
It was called @DoAsThouWilt.

00:17:28.680 --> 00:17:33.620 align:middle line:84%
So now we have a Crowley layer
that's added into all this.

00:17:33.620 --> 00:17:36.670 align:middle line:84%
And this is just another
kind of interesting factoid.

00:17:36.670 --> 00:17:39.310 align:middle line:90%
Philip means "lover of horses."

00:17:39.310 --> 00:17:41.670 align:middle line:84%
Hoffman dies in the
Year of the Horse

00:17:41.670 --> 00:17:44.264 align:middle line:84%
by shooting heroin,
also known as horse.

00:17:44.264 --> 00:17:45.430 align:middle line:90%
So it's getting layered now.

00:17:45.430 --> 00:17:48.384 align:middle line:84%
We're starting to stack
things up a bit here.

00:17:48.384 --> 00:17:50.300 align:middle line:84%
Let's get into some more
Super Bowl anomalies.

00:17:50.300 --> 00:17:52.140 align:middle line:90%
This is part two.

00:17:52.140 --> 00:17:54.510 align:middle line:84%
Bruno Mars performed
at halftime,

00:17:54.510 --> 00:17:56.464 align:middle line:84%
and that is the
invocation of Mars.

00:17:56.464 --> 00:17:58.380 align:middle line:84%
That's what he did, was
an invocation of Mars.

00:17:58.380 --> 00:18:01.490 align:middle line:84%
He's a Libra, so we
have this combination

00:18:01.490 --> 00:18:05.030 align:middle line:84%
of Libra in Bruno
Mars and Mars itself.

00:18:05.030 --> 00:18:06.450 align:middle line:84%
And so what we
have, in some ways,

00:18:06.450 --> 00:18:08.950 align:middle line:84%
is kind of an iteration of the
alchemical marriage, the male

00:18:08.950 --> 00:18:11.240 align:middle line:84%
and the female, the
masculine and the feminine.

00:18:11.240 --> 00:18:13.830 align:middle line:84%
There is a player for
the Seattle Seahawks.

00:18:13.830 --> 00:18:17.080 align:middle line:90%
His name is Marshawn Lynch.

00:18:17.080 --> 00:18:19.690 align:middle line:84%
So we have Mars again
prominently displayed here.

00:18:19.690 --> 00:18:23.130 align:middle line:84%
His nickname-- the
Beast, of course.

00:18:23.130 --> 00:18:25.970 align:middle line:84%
Bruno Mars, his song,
"Locked Out of Heaven,"

00:18:25.970 --> 00:18:28.100 align:middle line:84%
is a paean to the fallen
angels who are locked out

00:18:28.100 --> 00:18:29.852 align:middle line:84%
of the angelic and
heavenly realms.

00:18:29.852 --> 00:18:30.810 align:middle line:90%
That's what it's about.

00:18:30.810 --> 00:18:32.325 align:middle line:90%
They can't get back to heaven.

00:18:32.325 --> 00:18:34.200 align:middle line:84%
So there are two things,
a couple things here

00:18:34.200 --> 00:18:35.160 align:middle line:90%
that really jump out.

00:18:35.160 --> 00:18:38.170 align:middle line:84%
First of all, if
look at Mars's set,

00:18:38.170 --> 00:18:40.810 align:middle line:84%
you can definitely see
some occult imagery.

00:18:40.810 --> 00:18:42.920 align:middle line:84%
Here we have the pyramid
in the background.

00:18:42.920 --> 00:18:43.987 align:middle line:90%
It's a pyramid of light.

00:18:43.987 --> 00:18:46.070 align:middle line:84%
They're getting very
sophisticated at these things

00:18:46.070 --> 00:18:46.990 align:middle line:90%
at halftime.

00:18:46.990 --> 00:18:50.020 align:middle line:84%
And then we have pyramids
that are pointed downward.

00:18:50.020 --> 00:18:52.050 align:middle line:84%
You can see them on
both sides of the stage.

00:18:52.050 --> 00:18:53.160 align:middle line:84%
They're pointed
downward, which means

00:18:53.160 --> 00:18:54.576 align:middle line:84%
they're pointed
towards the earth.

00:18:54.576 --> 00:18:59.360 align:middle line:84%
That's an invocation of
celestial or astral energy

00:18:59.360 --> 00:19:02.060 align:middle line:84%
and bringing it down
into the planet.

00:19:02.060 --> 00:19:04.670 align:middle line:84%
Here we see, again,
the pyramid imagery,

00:19:04.670 --> 00:19:06.730 align:middle line:84%
and this time the
pyramid is headed up.

00:19:06.730 --> 00:19:10.220 align:middle line:84%
So what's going on here
is that this is a portal.

00:19:10.220 --> 00:19:12.839 align:middle line:84%
Bruno Mars is opening a
portal with the pyramids,

00:19:12.839 --> 00:19:13.880 align:middle line:90%
with the magical symbols.

00:19:13.880 --> 00:19:15.671 align:middle line:84%
And again, you can see
the pyramid of light

00:19:15.671 --> 00:19:17.320 align:middle line:84%
in the background,
and everybody is

00:19:17.320 --> 00:19:21.680 align:middle line:84%
dressed in gold and performing
kind of a take on James Brown.

00:19:21.680 --> 00:19:24.890 align:middle line:84%
Seattle's fan base
is the 12th Man.

00:19:24.890 --> 00:19:28.470 align:middle line:84%
And again, what is the 12th
card in the Major Arcana?

00:19:28.470 --> 00:19:30.380 align:middle line:90%
It is the Hanged Man.

00:19:30.380 --> 00:19:32.910 align:middle line:90%
Represents Pisces, by the way.

00:19:32.910 --> 00:19:36.840 align:middle line:84%
And then 2014, the year
2014, if you add it up-- 20,

00:19:36.840 --> 00:19:39.264 align:middle line:90%
2 plus 14, that's 16.

00:19:39.264 --> 00:19:39.930 align:middle line:90%
What do you get?

00:19:39.930 --> 00:19:44.100 align:middle line:84%
You get the 16th card in
the deck, the Major Arcana,

00:19:44.100 --> 00:19:46.462 align:middle line:84%
the tower and the
imagery of Mars.

00:19:46.462 --> 00:19:48.420 align:middle line:84%
You can see the symbol
of Mars right down here.

00:19:48.420 --> 00:19:51.850 align:middle line:84%
And who's advocating all
this during halftime?

00:19:51.850 --> 00:19:53.190 align:middle line:90%
Bruno Mars.

00:19:53.190 --> 00:19:56.260 align:middle line:84%
The tower plays a very
large role in 2014,

00:19:56.260 --> 00:19:59.480 align:middle line:84%
because theoretically, again,
the One World Trade Tower

00:19:59.480 --> 00:20:04.160 align:middle line:84%
is supposed to be
consecrated this year.

00:20:04.160 --> 00:20:07.450 align:middle line:84%
So we have Mars energy all
throughout the year and Bruno

00:20:07.450 --> 00:20:10.520 align:middle line:84%
Mars setting it off
at the Super Bowl.

00:20:10.520 --> 00:20:12.060 align:middle line:84%
Mars energy, also
war energy, too.

00:20:12.060 --> 00:20:14.340 align:middle line:84%
All right, here's Super
Bowl anomalies part three.

00:20:14.340 --> 00:20:15.190 align:middle line:90%
There's more Mars.

00:20:15.190 --> 00:20:16.610 align:middle line:90%
It's the fall of Manning.

00:20:16.610 --> 00:20:18.310 align:middle line:90%
The fall of man, Peyton Manning.

00:20:18.310 --> 00:20:18.970 align:middle line:90%
Manning.

00:20:18.970 --> 00:20:20.610 align:middle line:90%
Aries again, Mars.

00:20:20.610 --> 00:20:21.610 align:middle line:90%
And you can look at him.

00:20:21.610 --> 00:20:23.660 align:middle line:90%
He looks absolutely sick here.

00:20:23.660 --> 00:20:25.690 align:middle line:84%
He looks like he
wants to throw up.

00:20:25.690 --> 00:20:27.950 align:middle line:84%
And nis number--
his uniform number

00:20:27.950 --> 00:20:30.180 align:middle line:84%
is 18, which is the
number of the moon.

00:20:30.180 --> 00:20:34.054 align:middle line:84%
So we have the feminine moon
overshadows masculine Mars,

00:20:34.054 --> 00:20:35.970 align:middle line:84%
because the number lives
on in Peyton Manning.

00:20:35.970 --> 00:20:36.970 align:middle line:90%
Well, his season's over.

00:20:36.970 --> 00:20:38.180 align:middle line:90%
He might even retire.

00:20:38.180 --> 00:20:42.059 align:middle line:84%
So what's also interesting,
in contrast to Peyton Manning,

00:20:42.059 --> 00:20:43.600 align:middle line:84%
is we have the fall
of Manning and we

00:20:43.600 --> 00:20:47.910 align:middle line:84%
have the rise of Russell Wilson,
in a very, very different kind

00:20:47.910 --> 00:20:48.990 align:middle line:90%
of pose.

00:20:48.990 --> 00:20:50.850 align:middle line:84%
Now, if you break
the name Wilson down,

00:20:50.850 --> 00:20:52.240 align:middle line:90%
you have the son of Will.

00:20:52.240 --> 00:20:53.700 align:middle line:84%
And then you have
L, the L, which

00:20:53.700 --> 00:20:56.100 align:middle line:84%
is the light, which is
also, by the way, Saturn.

00:20:56.100 --> 00:20:58.460 align:middle line:84%
Saturn is L. And
Russ, which is red.

00:20:58.460 --> 00:21:00.860 align:middle line:84%
So you have the Son of the
Will, the red son of the will

00:21:00.860 --> 00:21:01.640 align:middle line:90%
and Saturn.

00:21:01.640 --> 00:21:02.790 align:middle line:90%
Very fascinating.

00:21:02.790 --> 00:21:04.930 align:middle line:84%
And here, he's a
devout Christian.

00:21:04.930 --> 00:21:07.890 align:middle line:84%
You could go on his Twitter
account, @DangeRuss,

00:21:07.890 --> 00:21:09.590 align:middle line:84%
and he's always
quoting scripture.

00:21:09.590 --> 00:21:11.030 align:middle line:84%
But now he's
practicing TM, which

00:21:11.030 --> 00:21:12.560 align:middle line:84%
I thought was kind
of interesting.

00:21:12.560 --> 00:21:15.720 align:middle line:84%
And his number is 3 which is
the number of the Empress--

00:21:15.720 --> 00:21:18.930 align:middle line:84%
which is, of course,
the Goddess, right?

00:21:18.930 --> 00:21:22.030 align:middle line:84%
So we have with Russell
Wilson the number 3,

00:21:22.030 --> 00:21:23.730 align:middle line:90%
the invocation of the Goddess.

00:21:23.730 --> 00:21:27.250 align:middle line:84%
And he's rising and
Peyton Manning is falling.

00:21:27.250 --> 00:21:30.660 align:middle line:84%
Now another little interesting
wrinkle around all this stuff

00:21:30.660 --> 00:21:33.230 align:middle line:84%
is Babalon, the
Philadelphia Experiment,

00:21:33.230 --> 00:21:35.270 align:middle line:90%
and the Montauk Project.

00:21:35.270 --> 00:21:37.420 align:middle line:84%
Now Pete Carroll,
believe it or not,

00:21:37.420 --> 00:21:40.200 align:middle line:84%
shows up in a book by
Bob Frissell called

00:21:40.200 --> 00:21:41.602 align:middle line:90%
"Nothing In This Book Is True."

00:21:41.602 --> 00:21:42.810 align:middle line:90%
It's a very fascinating book.

00:21:42.810 --> 00:21:43.934 align:middle line:90%
I read it back in the '90s.

00:21:43.934 --> 00:21:45.800 align:middle line:90%
I actually met Bob.

00:21:45.800 --> 00:21:47.460 align:middle line:84%
And in that book,
he kind of goes

00:21:47.460 --> 00:21:49.705 align:middle line:84%
through his own awakening,
his own discovery.

00:21:49.705 --> 00:21:52.330 align:middle line:84%
And he hooks up with
Drunvalo Melchizedek

00:21:52.330 --> 00:21:54.950 align:middle line:84%
and learns about the Flower
of Life and talks about it.

00:21:54.950 --> 00:21:57.130 align:middle line:84%
And apparently,
according to Bob,

00:21:57.130 --> 00:22:01.920 align:middle line:84%
Drunvalo Melchizedek
introduces him to Pete Carroll.

00:22:01.920 --> 00:22:06.910 align:middle line:84%
And Pete Carroll, Drunvalo
said he met Duncan Cameron

00:22:06.910 --> 00:22:09.200 align:middle line:84%
through Pete Carroll,
who was at the time

00:22:09.200 --> 00:22:10.450 align:middle line:90%
a coach for the New York Jets.

00:22:10.450 --> 00:22:13.130 align:middle line:84%
Now Duncan Cameron is
one of the main players

00:22:13.130 --> 00:22:15.894 align:middle line:84%
of the Philadelphia Experiment
and the Montauk Project.

00:22:15.894 --> 00:22:17.310 align:middle line:84%
And who are we
talking about here?

00:22:17.310 --> 00:22:19.310 align:middle line:84%
We're also talking
about Marjorie Cameron.

00:22:19.310 --> 00:22:22.830 align:middle line:84%
If you get into the "Montauk
Chronicles," "Montauk

00:22:22.830 --> 00:22:25.100 align:middle line:84%
Revisited," and
"Synchronicity in Montauk,"

00:22:25.100 --> 00:22:28.080 align:middle line:84%
Peter Moon's really great
work on the whole Montauk

00:22:28.080 --> 00:22:30.040 align:middle line:84%
and Philadelphia
Experiment series,

00:22:30.040 --> 00:22:32.580 align:middle line:84%
you'll also find that the
name Wilson is quite prominent

00:22:32.580 --> 00:22:34.290 align:middle line:90%
as well throughout these books.

00:22:34.290 --> 00:22:37.030 align:middle line:84%
And who is the quarterback
for the Seattle Seahawks?

00:22:37.030 --> 00:22:38.610 align:middle line:90%
Russell Wilson.

00:22:38.610 --> 00:22:44.320 align:middle line:84%
So this is yet another series
of images and symbols and energy

00:22:44.320 --> 00:22:47.700 align:middle line:84%
all coming together as
part of perhaps some kind

00:22:47.700 --> 00:22:50.120 align:middle line:84%
of meta-ritual, some
kind of meta-ritual

00:22:50.120 --> 00:22:53.700 align:middle line:84%
within the holographic
matrix here.

00:22:53.700 --> 00:22:57.460 align:middle line:84%
Now, this is also another
fascinating image.

00:22:57.460 --> 00:23:00.560 align:middle line:84%
Before kickoff and
before the Denver Broncos

00:23:00.560 --> 00:23:04.310 align:middle line:84%
came out onto the field,
this horse and this woman

00:23:04.310 --> 00:23:05.110 align:middle line:90%
charged the field.

00:23:05.110 --> 00:23:06.280 align:middle line:90%
This is the horse.

00:23:06.280 --> 00:23:08.850 align:middle line:84%
This is the mascot of
the Denver Broncos,

00:23:08.850 --> 00:23:11.700 align:middle line:84%
and the name of the
horse is Thunder.

00:23:11.700 --> 00:23:12.930 align:middle line:90%
"Behold a pale horse."

00:23:12.930 --> 00:23:16.054 align:middle line:84%
We have a pale horse-- Year
of the Horse-- initiating

00:23:16.054 --> 00:23:17.595 align:middle line:84%
the Super Bowl whose
name is Thunder.

00:23:17.595 --> 00:23:21.975 align:middle line:84%
Thunder, of course, is also
Thor, the god of thunder.

00:23:21.975 --> 00:23:23.516 align:middle line:84%
Not associated with
Mars, by the way,

00:23:23.516 --> 00:23:25.050 align:middle line:90%
but planet Jupiter instead.

00:23:25.050 --> 00:23:27.930 align:middle line:84%
But nonetheless,
what takes down?

00:23:27.930 --> 00:23:29.350 align:middle line:90%
Let's just go back a few slides.

00:23:29.350 --> 00:23:31.280 align:middle line:90%
What takes down the tower?

00:23:31.280 --> 00:23:32.690 align:middle line:90%
Lighting and thunder.

00:23:32.690 --> 00:23:34.940 align:middle line:84%
So thunder is also
another prominent theme

00:23:34.940 --> 00:23:39.110 align:middle line:84%
being invoked at
Super Bowl XLVIII.

00:23:39.110 --> 00:23:40.860 align:middle line:84%
So I want to get into
a little astrology.

00:23:40.860 --> 00:23:42.510 align:middle line:84%
And I don't want to
make this too heavy

00:23:42.510 --> 00:23:45.093 align:middle line:84%
and I want to respect the fact
that Philip Seymour Hoffman has

00:23:45.093 --> 00:23:45.970 align:middle line:90%
passed away.

00:23:45.970 --> 00:23:48.350 align:middle line:84%
But I think it's kind of
interesting to at least look

00:23:48.350 --> 00:23:49.980 align:middle line:90%
at his chart.

00:23:49.980 --> 00:23:53.540 align:middle line:84%
And then I actually
have a chart where

00:23:53.540 --> 00:23:58.850 align:middle line:84%
it's around midnight of February
1 running into February 2,

00:23:58.850 --> 00:24:02.090 align:middle line:84%
and wanted to look at some
of the components here.

00:24:02.090 --> 00:24:05.682 align:middle line:84%
But one of the things that you
can see with the T-square--

00:24:05.682 --> 00:24:08.140 align:middle line:84%
because T-squares are always
really interesting to look at,

00:24:08.140 --> 00:24:10.230 align:middle line:90%
and they're not that uncommon.

00:24:10.230 --> 00:24:12.279 align:middle line:84%
A lot of people have
T-squares in their chart.

00:24:12.279 --> 00:24:14.570 align:middle line:84%
But one of the things that
Philip Seymour Hoffman would

00:24:14.570 --> 00:24:16.780 align:middle line:84%
have had a challenge
with is the square

00:24:16.780 --> 00:24:18.850 align:middle line:90%
between Neptune and the moon.

00:24:18.850 --> 00:24:20.470 align:middle line:84%
And whenever Neptune
comes into play,

00:24:20.470 --> 00:24:22.400 align:middle line:84%
we always have to
look at addiction.

00:24:22.400 --> 00:24:24.030 align:middle line:84%
And here it's in
the sixth house,

00:24:24.030 --> 00:24:27.010 align:middle line:84%
which is the house of work
and purpose and service.

00:24:27.010 --> 00:24:32.320 align:middle line:84%
Neptune, by the way, also
is one of the planets

00:24:32.320 --> 00:24:34.326 align:middle line:90%
that's associated with acting.

00:24:34.326 --> 00:24:35.950 align:middle line:84%
Some of the greatest
actors are Pisces,

00:24:35.950 --> 00:24:38.730 align:middle line:84%
and they're able to shift
their roles because they

00:24:38.730 --> 00:24:42.260 align:middle line:84%
have a very fluid
relationship with identity

00:24:42.260 --> 00:24:43.620 align:middle line:90%
in many instances.

00:24:43.620 --> 00:24:47.220 align:middle line:84%
But it's also related to, again,
addiction-- and especially

00:24:47.220 --> 00:24:51.550 align:middle line:84%
addiction as it is connected
to things like alcohol

00:24:51.550 --> 00:24:54.947 align:middle line:84%
and injectables like
heroin and morphine

00:24:54.947 --> 00:24:56.030 align:middle line:90%
and things of that nature.

00:24:56.030 --> 00:24:58.760 align:middle line:84%
So here we have Neptune
in the sixth house.

00:24:58.760 --> 00:25:02.230 align:middle line:84%
So Neptune ultimately
would be, theoretically,

00:25:02.230 --> 00:25:03.330 align:middle line:90%
his Achilles' heel.

00:25:03.330 --> 00:25:05.960 align:middle line:84%
Now what's going on with
Neptune is that at that time,

00:25:05.960 --> 00:25:07.820 align:middle line:90%
Saturn was right on Neptune.

00:25:07.820 --> 00:25:09.987 align:middle line:84%
So we had a Saturn moon
square, Saturn moon square,

00:25:09.987 --> 00:25:11.820 align:middle line:84%
which means he was going
through depression.

00:25:11.820 --> 00:25:13.210 align:middle line:84%
Any time you go through
a Saturn moon square,

00:25:13.210 --> 00:25:14.850 align:middle line:84%
if you have it in
your chart, there's

00:25:14.850 --> 00:25:16.870 align:middle line:84%
a chance you could be
a little depressed.

00:25:16.870 --> 00:25:18.411 align:middle line:84%
If you're going
through a Saturn moon

00:25:18.411 --> 00:25:20.989 align:middle line:84%
square in terms of transits,
you could have a temporary sense

00:25:20.989 --> 00:25:22.780 align:middle line:84%
of depression that you
have to get through.

00:25:22.780 --> 00:25:24.424 align:middle line:84%
That's kind of a
classic example.

00:25:24.424 --> 00:25:26.840 align:middle line:84%
So at that point in time,
Saturn was right on his Neptune.

00:25:26.840 --> 00:25:31.450 align:middle line:84%
It was hitting this addictive
piece in his sixth house

00:25:31.450 --> 00:25:33.627 align:middle line:84%
as it's related to his
work and his health.

00:25:33.627 --> 00:25:35.710 align:middle line:84%
And at the same time,
Saturn is squaring the moon.

00:25:35.710 --> 00:25:42.060 align:middle line:84%
Now his south node-- the true
node is over here in Taurus

00:25:42.060 --> 00:25:44.270 align:middle line:90%
at two degrees.

00:25:44.270 --> 00:25:45.620 align:middle line:90%
So it's at two degrees.

00:25:45.620 --> 00:25:47.900 align:middle line:84%
Now over here, the
true node is going

00:25:47.900 --> 00:25:49.930 align:middle line:90%
to be down around this area.

00:25:49.930 --> 00:25:51.170 align:middle line:90%
It's going to be right here.

00:25:51.170 --> 00:25:54.097 align:middle line:84%
It's also going to be in
his sixth house, which

00:25:54.097 --> 00:25:54.680 align:middle line:90%
is in Scorpio.

00:25:54.680 --> 00:25:57.730 align:middle line:84%
So the south node is down
here, and the south node

00:25:57.730 --> 00:25:59.070 align:middle line:90%
is considered the karmic node.

00:25:59.070 --> 00:26:01.780 align:middle line:84%
It is the Achilles'
heel of the chart.

00:26:01.780 --> 00:26:04.180 align:middle line:84%
You want to move away
from the south node.

00:26:04.180 --> 00:26:06.730 align:middle line:84%
You want to move towards the
true node or the north node.

00:26:06.730 --> 00:26:10.000 align:middle line:84%
For him, it's almost
in the 12th house,

00:26:10.000 --> 00:26:11.760 align:middle line:90%
which is the house of Pisces.

00:26:11.760 --> 00:26:15.030 align:middle line:84%
So again, he's moving
in a Piscean direction.

00:26:15.030 --> 00:26:18.730 align:middle line:84%
But with the true node
here in Taurus, the body,

00:26:18.730 --> 00:26:20.290 align:middle line:90%
it's like he's hanging on.

00:26:20.290 --> 00:26:21.492 align:middle line:90%
That's what it feels like.

00:26:21.492 --> 00:26:22.950 align:middle line:84%
Because the 11th
house is the house

00:26:22.950 --> 00:26:25.110 align:middle line:90%
of relationships, friends.

00:26:25.110 --> 00:26:27.720 align:middle line:84%
Relationship with friends
and associations and groups.

00:26:27.720 --> 00:26:29.970 align:middle line:84%
Probably would have been his
acting group, by the way,

00:26:29.970 --> 00:26:32.790 align:middle line:84%
Labyrinth, which he was
a part of with David Bar

00:26:32.790 --> 00:26:36.550 align:middle line:84%
Katz and his wife and Yul
Vazquez and some other people.

00:26:36.550 --> 00:26:39.120 align:middle line:84%
There it is, up
in the 11th house.

00:26:39.120 --> 00:26:41.410 align:middle line:84%
But here with the
true node, he's

00:26:41.410 --> 00:26:43.350 align:middle line:84%
trying to hang on
to the 11th house

00:26:43.350 --> 00:26:46.180 align:middle line:84%
without the true node
slipping down into the 12th,

00:26:46.180 --> 00:26:48.120 align:middle line:90%
into the obscurity of the 12th.

00:26:48.120 --> 00:26:51.960 align:middle line:84%
There's a lot of other
things going on here as well.

00:26:51.960 --> 00:26:54.740 align:middle line:84%
We have Neptune, transiting
Neptune and transiting Chiron.

00:26:54.740 --> 00:26:58.120 align:middle line:84%
Chiron is opposing
his Venus in Virgo.

00:26:58.120 --> 00:27:00.050 align:middle line:90%
And Chiron is up here in Pisces.

00:27:00.050 --> 00:27:01.410 align:middle line:90%
That's the 10th house.

00:27:01.410 --> 00:27:05.582 align:middle line:84%
That's the house of, in some
ways, fame, public standing,

00:27:05.582 --> 00:27:06.540 align:middle line:90%
what you're here to do.

00:27:06.540 --> 00:27:09.380 align:middle line:84%
So Chiron is transiting
through that house

00:27:09.380 --> 00:27:12.200 align:middle line:84%
and it's opposing Venus, which
is the house of relationships.

00:27:12.200 --> 00:27:14.970 align:middle line:84%
So theoretically, he should be
having healthy relationships

00:27:14.970 --> 00:27:16.350 align:middle line:90%
with Venus in Virgo.

00:27:16.350 --> 00:27:18.420 align:middle line:84%
But with Chiron
in Pisces up here

00:27:18.420 --> 00:27:20.220 align:middle line:84%
in the realm of
professional standing,

00:27:20.220 --> 00:27:24.757 align:middle line:84%
that Chiron is drawing him
away from those experiences,

00:27:24.757 --> 00:27:26.840 align:middle line:84%
from actually having-- he
should have stayed home.

00:27:26.840 --> 00:27:30.740 align:middle line:84%
That's Venus in the
fourth house, in Virgo.

00:27:30.740 --> 00:27:33.060 align:middle line:90%
He's a 29th-degree Cancer.

00:27:33.060 --> 00:27:34.690 align:middle line:90%
He's at the Anaretic Degree.

00:27:34.690 --> 00:27:36.812 align:middle line:84%
So he really wants to
go to Leo in some ways.

00:27:36.812 --> 00:27:38.520 align:middle line:84%
That's what the Anaretic
degree is about.

00:27:38.520 --> 00:27:40.150 align:middle line:84%
You want to get
to the next sign.

00:27:40.150 --> 00:27:44.890 align:middle line:84%
But he has lessons to be
learned from being a Cancer.

00:27:44.890 --> 00:27:46.810 align:middle line:90%
He can't really move on.

00:27:46.810 --> 00:27:50.210 align:middle line:84%
And part of his lesson
with that Cancer

00:27:50.210 --> 00:27:53.710 align:middle line:84%
is that he has to
nurture and care

00:27:53.710 --> 00:27:55.827 align:middle line:84%
not just for others, but
for himself, as well.

00:27:55.827 --> 00:27:57.660 align:middle line:84%
But because it's in the
third house-- that's

00:27:57.660 --> 00:28:00.260 align:middle line:84%
the House of Gemini--
it's about his thoughts.

00:28:00.260 --> 00:28:03.610 align:middle line:84%
And here we have a
sun squaring Mars

00:28:03.610 --> 00:28:05.520 align:middle line:90%
in the first agree of Scorpio.

00:28:05.520 --> 00:28:09.750 align:middle line:84%
And even though-- this is
kind of an out-of-sign square.

00:28:09.750 --> 00:28:11.100 align:middle line:90%
It's not common.

00:28:11.100 --> 00:28:13.350 align:middle line:84%
Because he has a sun
in a water sign and he

00:28:13.350 --> 00:28:14.569 align:middle line:90%
has his Mars in a water sign.

00:28:14.569 --> 00:28:16.110 align:middle line:84%
But they're squaring
each other based

00:28:16.110 --> 00:28:17.920 align:middle line:90%
on the angle and the degree.

00:28:17.920 --> 00:28:20.420 align:middle line:84%
And that could lead to
a lot of frustration

00:28:20.420 --> 00:28:24.700 align:middle line:84%
and a lot of kind of pent-up
and hidden energy and emotion.

00:28:24.700 --> 00:28:28.760 align:middle line:84%
But he has a very nice trine to
Neptune, which I think really

00:28:28.760 --> 00:28:31.660 align:middle line:84%
sort of typifies his
acting abilities.

00:28:31.660 --> 00:28:33.770 align:middle line:84%
And ultimately, though,
he's led by the moon.

00:28:33.770 --> 00:28:36.460 align:middle line:84%
He's led by the moon right
there on the midheaven.

00:28:36.460 --> 00:28:39.750 align:middle line:84%
And the moon, again, was
being squared by Saturn.

00:28:39.750 --> 00:28:41.890 align:middle line:84%
And we have an
Aquarius midheaven

00:28:41.890 --> 00:28:44.350 align:middle line:84%
and then we have Gemini
on the ascendant.

00:28:44.350 --> 00:28:46.380 align:middle line:84%
So one of the things
that he was was

00:28:46.380 --> 00:28:48.030 align:middle line:90%
that he could be two people.

00:28:48.030 --> 00:28:50.730 align:middle line:84%
There was the, kind of the
public Philip Seymour Hoffman,

00:28:50.730 --> 00:28:52.479 align:middle line:84%
who was functional,
and there was probably

00:28:52.479 --> 00:28:54.350 align:middle line:84%
the very private
Philip Seymour Hoffman,

00:28:54.350 --> 00:28:56.730 align:middle line:84%
who was dealing with
some real demons here.

00:28:56.730 --> 00:28:58.080 align:middle line:90%
Let's move on to the next slide.

00:28:58.080 --> 00:29:00.700 align:middle line:84%
This is-- I took the
time of his death

00:29:00.700 --> 00:29:02.580 align:middle line:84%
and I put it together
with his own chart.

00:29:02.580 --> 00:29:04.660 align:middle line:84%
And what I thought
was really fascinating

00:29:04.660 --> 00:29:08.140 align:middle line:84%
was the influence of
transiting Venus and transiting

00:29:08.140 --> 00:29:09.820 align:middle line:90%
Pluto in the eight house.

00:29:09.820 --> 00:29:11.810 align:middle line:84%
Now, the eighth house
is the house of Scorpio.

00:29:11.810 --> 00:29:14.170 align:middle line:84%
It's death, it's sex, it's
rebirth, it's compulsions,

00:29:14.170 --> 00:29:16.700 align:middle line:84%
it's obsession-- yes, it
can even be addiction.

00:29:16.700 --> 00:29:17.940 align:middle line:90%
And what do we have here?

00:29:17.940 --> 00:29:20.550 align:middle line:84%
We have transiting-- now he
had transiting Pluto going

00:29:20.550 --> 00:29:22.550 align:middle line:84%
through his eight house,
which is quite intense.

00:29:22.550 --> 00:29:24.380 align:middle line:84%
I mean, that is a journey
to the underworld,

00:29:24.380 --> 00:29:26.180 align:middle line:84%
and that's going to be
going on for quite a while.

00:29:26.180 --> 00:29:28.180 align:middle line:84%
You get through a
Pluto-in-eighth-house transit,

00:29:28.180 --> 00:29:31.790 align:middle line:84%
you come out the other side
and you have reached a certain

00:29:31.790 --> 00:29:37.890 align:middle line:84%
degree of shamanic mastery,
for lack of a better term.

00:29:37.890 --> 00:29:40.480 align:middle line:84%
This is a very
profound initiation

00:29:40.480 --> 00:29:41.820 align:middle line:90%
that he was going through.

00:29:41.820 --> 00:29:43.950 align:middle line:84%
And what's happening here
is that transiting Venus

00:29:43.950 --> 00:29:47.020 align:middle line:84%
was right there at that
time on his eighth house.

00:29:47.020 --> 00:29:48.970 align:middle line:84%
We have a Venus-Pluto
conjunction.

00:29:48.970 --> 00:29:49.670 align:middle line:90%
What is Venus?

00:29:49.670 --> 00:29:50.860 align:middle line:90%
It's relationships, right?

00:29:50.860 --> 00:29:51.961 align:middle line:90%
It's friends.

00:29:51.961 --> 00:29:52.710 align:middle line:90%
That's what it is.

00:29:52.710 --> 00:29:55.240 align:middle line:90%
It's in Capricorn.

00:29:55.240 --> 00:29:56.260 align:middle line:90%
And it's hidden.

00:29:56.260 --> 00:29:57.930 align:middle line:84%
It's taking place
in the eighth house.

00:29:57.930 --> 00:29:59.610 align:middle line:90%
It's behind the scenes.

00:29:59.610 --> 00:30:01.870 align:middle line:84%
And this is actually
a very kind of-- well,

00:30:01.870 --> 00:30:05.350 align:middle line:84%
it's kind of a deadly and a
dangerous conjunction taking

00:30:05.350 --> 00:30:05.850 align:middle line:90%
place.

00:30:05.850 --> 00:30:06.350 align:middle line:90%
Why?

00:30:06.350 --> 00:30:09.530 align:middle line:84%
Because it's opposing
his own natal

00:30:09.530 --> 00:30:11.930 align:middle line:90%
Mercury in the second house.

00:30:11.930 --> 00:30:16.170 align:middle line:84%
And transiting Jupiter is
right on that natal Mercury.

00:30:16.170 --> 00:30:17.340 align:middle line:90%
It's retrograde.

00:30:17.340 --> 00:30:20.900 align:middle line:84%
So what's happening here is
he can't trust his own voice.

00:30:20.900 --> 00:30:23.940 align:middle line:84%
He can't trust his own
ability to make decisions--

00:30:23.940 --> 00:30:27.210 align:middle line:84%
solid, sound decisions--
again in the house of Taurus.

00:30:27.210 --> 00:30:27.710 align:middle line:90%
Why?

00:30:27.710 --> 00:30:29.650 align:middle line:84%
Because he's being
pulled apart here.

00:30:29.650 --> 00:30:32.950 align:middle line:84%
He's being pulled apart by
influence, Venus and Pluto,

00:30:32.950 --> 00:30:34.670 align:middle line:90%
coming through the eighth house.

00:30:34.670 --> 00:30:37.470 align:middle line:84%
Now here is Jupiter
in Cancer retrograde

00:30:37.470 --> 00:30:39.080 align:middle line:90%
on top of his Mercury.

00:30:39.080 --> 00:30:41.180 align:middle line:84%
And Jupiter, theoretically,
would give him

00:30:41.180 --> 00:30:43.620 align:middle line:84%
a sense that
everything could be all

00:30:43.620 --> 00:30:45.700 align:middle line:90%
right, that he wasn't in danger.

00:30:45.700 --> 00:30:48.730 align:middle line:84%
But because it's retrograde,
he may not necessarily

00:30:48.730 --> 00:30:49.680 align:middle line:90%
be able to trust that.

00:30:49.680 --> 00:30:51.080 align:middle line:90%
And now what do we have here?

00:30:51.080 --> 00:30:53.610 align:middle line:84%
We've got Saturn in
square with these planets

00:30:53.610 --> 00:30:54.650 align:middle line:90%
in the 11th house.

00:30:54.650 --> 00:30:56.340 align:middle line:90%
Again, this is friends.

00:30:56.340 --> 00:30:57.580 align:middle line:90%
It's friends, the 11th house.

00:30:57.580 --> 00:30:59.210 align:middle line:90%
Aquarius, the house of friends.

00:30:59.210 --> 00:31:01.400 align:middle line:84%
So these planets-- Venus
is squaring his Saturn.

00:31:01.400 --> 00:31:03.250 align:middle line:90%
Pluto is squaring his Saturn.

00:31:03.250 --> 00:31:04.760 align:middle line:84%
And then we have
Uranus right on top

00:31:04.760 --> 00:31:09.650 align:middle line:84%
of his Saturn, which
is a very intense kind

00:31:09.650 --> 00:31:11.780 align:middle line:90%
of alchemical combination.

00:31:11.780 --> 00:31:13.700 align:middle line:84%
Uranus wants to
bring change and it

00:31:13.700 --> 00:31:15.270 align:middle line:90%
wants to bring change right now.

00:31:15.270 --> 00:31:17.320 align:middle line:84%
And Saturn is about
doing things the way

00:31:17.320 --> 00:31:19.520 align:middle line:84%
you've been doing them
for a very long time.

00:31:19.520 --> 00:31:20.660 align:middle line:90%
So he was conflicted.

00:31:20.660 --> 00:31:23.480 align:middle line:84%
I think that this
Uranus-Saturn conjunction

00:31:23.480 --> 00:31:28.230 align:middle line:84%
has to do with him being
ostensibly clean prior

00:31:28.230 --> 00:31:32.270 align:middle line:84%
to this moment and then
hitting this T-square vis-a-vis

00:31:32.270 --> 00:31:35.660 align:middle line:84%
elements in his
life that took him

00:31:35.660 --> 00:31:38.290 align:middle line:90%
into a very, very dark place.

00:31:38.290 --> 00:31:39.980 align:middle line:84%
And we have Saturn
here again-- we

00:31:39.980 --> 00:31:42.420 align:middle line:84%
talked about this already--
Saturn on his Neptune.

00:31:42.420 --> 00:31:45.420 align:middle line:84%
And then we have the
true node on top of Mars.

00:31:45.420 --> 00:31:46.690 align:middle line:90%
Very powerful.

00:31:46.690 --> 00:31:50.040 align:middle line:84%
Very profound chart for
this moment in time.

00:31:50.040 --> 00:31:50.860 align:middle line:90%
I will say this.

00:31:50.860 --> 00:31:53.292 align:middle line:84%
Had he gotten
through that night,

00:31:53.292 --> 00:31:55.250 align:middle line:84%
whatever was going on
there in that apartment--

00:31:55.250 --> 00:31:56.150 align:middle line:84%
I don't think he was
alone in that office.

00:31:56.150 --> 00:31:57.620 align:middle line:90%
He was not alone.

00:31:57.620 --> 00:32:02.400 align:middle line:84%
Had he gotten through this, he
would have passed a major node

00:32:02.400 --> 00:32:05.260 align:middle line:84%
in his own personal
evolution, development.

00:32:05.260 --> 00:32:07.940 align:middle line:84%
Not only in this lifetime, but
I'll even say past lifetimes,

00:32:07.940 --> 00:32:08.695 align:middle line:90%
as well.

00:32:08.695 --> 00:32:11.060 align:middle line:84%
All right, let's move on
to another slide here.

00:32:11.060 --> 00:32:12.910 align:middle line:90%
So the Babalon Working.

00:32:12.910 --> 00:32:13.840 align:middle line:90%
What has it done?

00:32:13.840 --> 00:32:15.337 align:middle line:90%
What has it brought us?

00:32:15.337 --> 00:32:17.670 align:middle line:84%
Now I'm about to say some
things that you may or may not

00:32:17.670 --> 00:32:19.250 align:middle line:90%
agree with.

00:32:19.250 --> 00:32:20.810 align:middle line:84%
And it's a Libra
Moon, so I'm going

00:32:20.810 --> 00:32:23.680 align:middle line:84%
to try to say them as
diplomatically as possible.

00:32:23.680 --> 00:32:25.930 align:middle line:84%
But one of the things that's
happened with the Babalon

00:32:25.930 --> 00:32:31.327 align:middle line:84%
Working as I see it is that it
has invoked the spirit of the,

00:32:31.327 --> 00:32:32.910 align:middle line:84%
quote unquote, "the
Whore of Babalon."

00:32:32.910 --> 00:32:35.200 align:middle line:84%
I know it's a loaded
term, but I'm sorry,

00:32:35.200 --> 00:32:37.500 align:middle line:84%
that's what we're talking
about here, the Great

00:32:37.500 --> 00:32:41.740 align:middle line:84%
Harlot, and Mystery, as
she's known in Revelation.

00:32:41.740 --> 00:32:44.260 align:middle line:84%
The goddess-- the Dark
Goddess by the way.

00:32:44.260 --> 00:32:46.910 align:middle line:84%
And she has come into
the 20th century,

00:32:46.910 --> 00:32:51.260 align:middle line:84%
perhaps thank you very much
to Jack, Ron, and Dorothy.

00:32:51.260 --> 00:32:53.780 align:middle line:84%
And as a result, we're living
with some very interesting

00:32:53.780 --> 00:32:54.490 align:middle line:90%
imagery.

00:32:54.490 --> 00:32:55.900 align:middle line:90%
And it's not just imagery.

00:32:55.900 --> 00:32:59.570 align:middle line:84%
It's impacting us on
a day-to-day basis.

00:32:59.570 --> 00:33:04.360 align:middle line:84%
Who is one of the most popular
women on the planet right now?

00:33:04.360 --> 00:33:05.030 align:middle line:90%
That one.

00:33:05.030 --> 00:33:06.700 align:middle line:90%
That's Miley Cyrus.

00:33:06.700 --> 00:33:10.500 align:middle line:84%
And have you ever
seen an image that

00:33:10.500 --> 00:33:13.770 align:middle line:84%
evokes Babalon
more than this one?

00:33:13.770 --> 00:33:14.480 align:middle line:90%
There she is.

00:33:14.480 --> 00:33:15.700 align:middle line:90%
She's in concert.

00:33:15.700 --> 00:33:21.270 align:middle line:84%
She's got her tongue out and she
is just lapping the money up.

00:33:21.270 --> 00:33:22.810 align:middle line:90%
I mean, this is it.

00:33:22.810 --> 00:33:24.797 align:middle line:90%
This is Babalon in a nutshell.

00:33:24.797 --> 00:33:26.630 align:middle line:84%
So this is an image
that we're dealing with,

00:33:26.630 --> 00:33:28.820 align:middle line:90%
but it goes beyond her.

00:33:28.820 --> 00:33:30.140 align:middle line:90%
It goes way beyond her.

00:33:30.140 --> 00:33:31.600 align:middle line:84%
So the goal of
Babalon Working was

00:33:31.600 --> 00:33:33.350 align:middle line:84%
to reintroduce the
Goddess via the moonlet

00:33:33.350 --> 00:33:36.670 align:middle line:84%
into the 20th century, to
usurp the bloodthirsty, greedy,

00:33:36.670 --> 00:33:38.690 align:middle line:90%
exploitative patriarchy.

00:33:38.690 --> 00:33:42.020 align:middle line:84%
If Hubbard, Parsons, and
Cameron were successful,

00:33:42.020 --> 00:33:43.130 align:middle line:90%
what was the net effect?

00:33:43.130 --> 00:33:45.230 align:middle line:90%
Well, here we have Miley Cyrus.

00:33:45.230 --> 00:33:46.730 align:middle line:84%
And then below, I
wanted to show you

00:33:46.730 --> 00:33:49.700 align:middle line:84%
some examples of what we're
doing to our young women.

00:33:49.700 --> 00:33:55.680 align:middle line:84%
The sexualization of young women
in our culture is aberrant.

00:33:55.680 --> 00:33:59.570 align:middle line:90%
And it's becoming acceptable.

00:33:59.570 --> 00:34:02.010 align:middle line:90%
It's becoming acceptable.

00:34:02.010 --> 00:34:03.660 align:middle line:84%
This is one of
the manifestations

00:34:03.660 --> 00:34:05.810 align:middle line:90%
of what I'm talking about.

00:34:05.810 --> 00:34:09.557 align:middle line:84%
Another manifestation
is taking the feminine,

00:34:09.557 --> 00:34:10.931 align:middle line:84%
the divine feminine,
and going in

00:34:10.931 --> 00:34:13.550 align:middle line:90%
the absolute opposite direction.

00:34:13.550 --> 00:34:18.409 align:middle line:84%
So here we have the prostitution
of the feminine energy

00:34:18.409 --> 00:34:19.960 align:middle line:90%
at a very young age.

00:34:19.960 --> 00:34:23.540 align:middle line:84%
And here we have
the glorification

00:34:23.540 --> 00:34:29.330 align:middle line:84%
of the martial energy, of
the feminine expression,

00:34:29.330 --> 00:34:30.670 align:middle line:90%
in our time.

00:34:30.670 --> 00:34:31.770 align:middle line:90%
This is Cris Cyborg.

00:34:31.770 --> 00:34:36.440 align:middle line:84%
She is an MMA fighter,
super intense.

00:34:36.440 --> 00:34:39.100 align:middle line:84%
So we're going
towards two extremes.

00:34:39.100 --> 00:34:42.760 align:middle line:84%
We're going towards the extreme
feminization at an early age

00:34:42.760 --> 00:34:47.699 align:middle line:84%
and the extreme
masculinization of the feminine

00:34:47.699 --> 00:34:51.820 align:middle line:84%
through MMA and the
army, and you know,

00:34:51.820 --> 00:34:55.190 align:middle line:84%
women have to do
everything as well as men.

00:34:55.190 --> 00:34:57.450 align:middle line:84%
That's what this
has manifested as.

00:34:57.450 --> 00:34:59.430 align:middle line:90%
And what's happening to men?

00:34:59.430 --> 00:35:02.210 align:middle line:84%
Well, first of all, men are
going in the other direction.

00:35:02.210 --> 00:35:03.910 align:middle line:90%
Here we have a boy band.

00:35:03.910 --> 00:35:05.659 align:middle line:84%
I think this is a
Korean boy band.

00:35:05.659 --> 00:35:07.950 align:middle line:84%
And it all started with Johnny
Depp and metrosexuality,

00:35:07.950 --> 00:35:09.030 align:middle line:90%
by the way.

00:35:09.030 --> 00:35:12.180 align:middle line:84%
And here we have a player
for New Mexico State.

00:35:12.180 --> 00:35:14.980 align:middle line:84%
Now one of the big things
is to get football players

00:35:14.980 --> 00:35:18.220 align:middle line:84%
to wear pink, and this is
through the Susan G. Komen

00:35:18.220 --> 00:35:21.706 align:middle line:84%
Foundation, a month out of
every year for breast cancer

00:35:21.706 --> 00:35:22.205 align:middle line:90%
awareness.

00:35:22.205 --> 00:35:23.590 align:middle line:90%
It's a month.

00:35:23.590 --> 00:35:25.240 align:middle line:90%
Players have to wear pink.

00:35:25.240 --> 00:35:28.260 align:middle line:84%
And it went from being
maybe for a week,

00:35:28.260 --> 00:35:31.200 align:middle line:84%
one game-- now it's
for an entire month.

00:35:31.200 --> 00:35:33.000 align:middle line:84%
And there are
people that believe

00:35:33.000 --> 00:35:38.430 align:middle line:84%
that this is part of
the demasculinization

00:35:38.430 --> 00:35:40.420 align:middle line:90%
of the male species.

00:35:40.420 --> 00:35:43.600 align:middle line:84%
So we have one energy which
is headed in this direction

00:35:43.600 --> 00:35:45.770 align:middle line:84%
and in this direction,
and we have another energy

00:35:45.770 --> 00:35:47.770 align:middle line:90%
that's headed in this direction.

00:35:47.770 --> 00:35:51.474 align:middle line:84%
And as an aside, Bruce Jenner
is getting a sex change.

00:35:51.474 --> 00:35:53.140 align:middle line:84%
I don't know if you've
seen that or not.

00:35:53.140 --> 00:35:56.470 align:middle line:84%
But he just had an
Adam's apple operation

00:35:56.470 --> 00:35:58.600 align:middle line:84%
and he's getting
hormone therapy.

00:35:58.600 --> 00:35:59.640 align:middle line:90%
So here we go.

00:35:59.640 --> 00:36:02.580 align:middle line:84%
Bruce Jenner, who was
at one point in time

00:36:02.580 --> 00:36:07.140 align:middle line:84%
a major figure and symbol for
masculinity and virility--

00:36:07.140 --> 00:36:13.492 align:middle line:84%
he won the Decathlon
in the Olympics.

00:36:13.492 --> 00:36:15.200 align:middle line:84%
In fact, I used to
train at the same YMCA

00:36:15.200 --> 00:36:18.269 align:middle line:84%
with Bruce Jenner in
Santa Clara, California.

00:36:18.269 --> 00:36:19.060 align:middle line:90%
And now what is he?

00:36:19.060 --> 00:36:23.370 align:middle line:90%
He's became demasculinized.

00:36:23.370 --> 00:36:27.130 align:middle line:84%
He lost his
masculinity literally,

00:36:27.130 --> 00:36:29.360 align:middle line:84%
I think, through the
connection with Kardashians,

00:36:29.360 --> 00:36:31.010 align:middle line:90%
and now he's becoming a woman.

00:36:31.010 --> 00:36:32.560 align:middle line:84%
And just as an
interesting side note,

00:36:32.560 --> 00:36:36.330 align:middle line:84%
Bruce Jenner's from Sandy Hook,
just in case you didn't know.

00:36:36.330 --> 00:36:37.270 align:middle line:90%
So there we go.

00:36:37.270 --> 00:36:40.350 align:middle line:84%
We've reached the end of this
strange tale of the Babalon

00:36:40.350 --> 00:36:42.850 align:middle line:84%
Working and the
energies that it's

00:36:42.850 --> 00:36:46.220 align:middle line:84%
left us with in the 20th and
21st century-- manifesting

00:36:46.220 --> 00:36:50.865 align:middle line:84%
perhaps in the occult and arcane
astral ritual of the Super

00:36:50.865 --> 00:36:53.820 align:middle line:84%
Bowl, the death of Phil Seymour
Hoffman, the death of River

00:36:53.820 --> 00:36:56.890 align:middle line:84%
Phoenix, through the
film and the cinematrix

00:36:56.890 --> 00:36:59.350 align:middle line:84%
of "The Master"
and other movies.

00:36:59.350 --> 00:37:04.370 align:middle line:84%
And also through the split of
the sexes in such a diverse way

00:37:04.370 --> 00:37:06.360 align:middle line:84%
that we, in some ways,
might have even lost

00:37:06.360 --> 00:37:07.970 align:middle line:90%
our way socially.

00:37:07.970 --> 00:37:11.024 align:middle line:84%
But it is the Libra Moon,
and you have an opportunity

00:37:11.024 --> 00:37:13.190 align:middle line:84%
to go right out from here,
from this point forward--

00:37:13.190 --> 00:37:14.960 align:middle line:84%
even if you're watching
this in Libra moon--

00:37:14.960 --> 00:37:16.670 align:middle line:84%
to create some balance
in your own life.

00:37:16.670 --> 00:37:17.628 align:middle line:90%
This is Robert Phoenix.

00:37:17.628 --> 00:37:20.220 align:middle line:84%
Join me next time again
on "The Eleventh House."

00:37:20.220 --> 00:37:31.100 align:middle line:90%
