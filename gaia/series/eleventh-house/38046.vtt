00:00:21.788 --> 00:00:25.659 align:middle line:84%
>> Robert Phoenix: On November
22nd, 1963 there was a shot

00:00:25.659 --> 00:00:27.227 align:middle line:90%
that was heard round the world.

00:00:27.227 --> 00:00:28.462 align:middle line:84%
Perhaps there was
more than one shot

00:00:28.462 --> 00:00:30.130 align:middle line:90%
that was heard round the world.

00:00:30.130 --> 00:00:32.165 align:middle line:84%
What I'm talking
about is the death

00:00:32.165 --> 00:00:36.770 align:middle line:84%
of John Fitzgerald Kennedy, then
President of the United States.

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:40.807 align:middle line:84%
It's a significant date
in a significant time,

00:00:40.807 --> 00:00:45.045 align:middle line:84%
a significant event that
not only changed the course

00:00:45.045 --> 00:00:46.980 align:middle line:90%
of history for this country

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:49.783 align:middle line:84%
but might have even changed
the nature of time itself

00:00:49.783 --> 00:00:53.420 align:middle line:84%
and split us off onto
an alternate timeline

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:56.056 align:middle line:90%
which we're now occupying.

00:00:56.056 --> 00:00:58.592 align:middle line:84%
For the next segment on
The Eleventh House  I'll be

00:00:58.592 --> 00:01:02.362 align:middle line:84%
exploring this theme of the
death of John F. Kennedy.

00:01:02.362 --> 00:01:04.631 align:middle line:84%
We're here in Texas, in
Austin, in the capital.

00:01:04.631 --> 00:01:06.399 align:middle line:90%
We're not at Dealey Plaza

00:01:06.399 --> 00:01:10.003 align:middle line:84%
where theoretically this
should be being shot on the --

00:01:10.003 --> 00:01:14.141 align:middle line:84%
essentially the eve of the 50th
anniversary of the death of JFK,

00:01:14.141 --> 00:01:15.475 align:middle line:90%
but it's a long way away.

00:01:15.475 --> 00:01:17.677 align:middle line:84%
It's not really in
the budget right now,

00:01:17.677 --> 00:01:20.013 align:middle line:84%
and there is a government
shutdown,

00:01:20.013 --> 00:01:22.182 align:middle line:90%
and it's a national monument.

00:01:22.182 --> 00:01:25.619 align:middle line:84%
So all those things considered
we're right here in Austin.

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:28.021 align:middle line:84%
This is the state
capital behind me.

00:01:28.021 --> 00:01:34.094 align:middle line:84%
Austin itself has a very rich
and interesting esoteric history

00:01:34.094 --> 00:01:36.129 align:middle line:90%
as does the state of Texas.

00:01:36.129 --> 00:01:39.866 align:middle line:84%
Texas is a Capricorn
state, and it's also --

00:01:39.866 --> 00:01:41.835 align:middle line:90%
it also has a Capricorn moon,

00:01:41.835 --> 00:01:43.737 align:middle line:84%
which makes it a
double Capricorn.

00:01:43.737 --> 00:01:47.607 align:middle line:84%
One of the manifestations of
Capricorn of course is Baphomet.

00:01:47.607 --> 00:01:51.878 align:middle line:84%
Austin itself is a Capricorn
sun, but it has a Libra moon.

00:01:51.878 --> 00:01:55.749 align:middle line:84%
And the Libra moon of course
is very conducive to poets,

00:01:55.749 --> 00:01:57.884 align:middle line:84%
and artists, and
musicians, and more of a --

00:01:57.884 --> 00:02:00.053 align:middle line:84%
an open in state of
mind, an open state

00:02:00.053 --> 00:02:02.022 align:middle line:90%
of emotional connection.

00:02:02.022 --> 00:02:04.791 align:middle line:84%
So there's a fair amount of
tolerance here in Austin.

00:02:04.791 --> 00:02:07.160 align:middle line:84%
In some ways it's quite
different than the state

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:10.630 align:middle line:84%
of Texas itself; they
call it the "Third Coast."

00:02:10.630 --> 00:02:12.599 align:middle line:84%
Now as we move through
this segment

00:02:12.599 --> 00:02:15.235 align:middle line:84%
of  The Eleventh House  we're
going to be talking about JFK;

00:02:15.235 --> 00:02:18.738 align:middle line:84%
we're going to be talking about
LBJ; we're going to be talking

00:02:18.738 --> 00:02:23.476 align:middle line:84%
about why Texas was so
important in this meta ritual,

00:02:23.476 --> 00:02:26.880 align:middle line:84%
this mega event which
changed everyone's life.

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:29.482 align:middle line:84%
We're also going to be
touching on George W. Bush --

00:02:29.482 --> 00:02:34.054 align:middle line:84%
actually George H. W.
Bush and George W. Bush.

00:02:34.054 --> 00:02:35.622 align:middle line:90%
We'll also look into the Beatles

00:02:35.622 --> 00:02:39.459 align:middle line:84%
and why they play a significant
role in the history that unfolds

00:02:39.459 --> 00:02:40.660 align:middle line:90%
after the death of JFK.

00:02:40.660 --> 00:02:44.998 align:middle line:84%
We'll talk about Tim
Leary, Mary Pinchot Meyer.

00:02:44.998 --> 00:02:46.900 align:middle line:84%
We'll talk about
the Twin Towers.

00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:52.305 align:middle line:84%
And we'll move -- fast
forward, into November 2013

00:02:52.305 --> 00:02:54.307 align:middle line:84%
because there's a lot
happening astrologically

00:02:54.307 --> 00:02:56.476 align:middle line:90%
in November of 2013.

00:02:56.476 --> 00:03:01.548 align:middle line:84%
Number one, we have the next
series of squares between Uranus

00:03:01.548 --> 00:03:03.650 align:middle line:84%
and Aries, and Pluto
and Capricorn.

00:03:03.650 --> 00:03:07.587 align:middle line:84%
Pluto and Capricorn
being of course Baphomet.

00:03:07.587 --> 00:03:09.456 align:middle line:90%
We also have Mercury retrograde.

00:03:09.456 --> 00:03:11.424 align:middle line:90%
We have an eclipse.

00:03:11.424 --> 00:03:13.927 align:middle line:84%
We have the arrival
of Comet ISON.

00:03:13.927 --> 00:03:16.696 align:middle line:84%
All amidst the governmental
shutdown.

00:03:16.696 --> 00:03:17.998 align:middle line:90%
What does that mean to you?

00:03:17.998 --> 00:03:20.834 align:middle line:84%
Well, we'll explore that,
but also we'll explore again

00:03:20.834 --> 00:03:24.037 align:middle line:90%
in depth the 50th anniversary

00:03:24.037 --> 00:03:26.239 align:middle line:84%
of the assassination
of John F. Kennedy.

00:03:26.239 --> 00:03:29.676 align:middle line:84%
Of course the number 50 is
significant in and of itself;

00:03:29.676 --> 00:03:33.079 align:middle line:84%
it represents the number
five, and of course Texas --

00:03:33.079 --> 00:03:34.214 align:middle line:90%
Texas is ruled

00:03:34.214 --> 00:03:37.651 align:middle line:84%
by the five-pointed star
or the number of man.

00:03:37.651 --> 00:03:40.020 align:middle line:84%
So all that plays into
what we're going to explore

00:03:40.020 --> 00:03:43.556 align:middle line:84%
and experience together over
the course of the next segment

00:03:43.556 --> 00:03:44.858 align:middle line:90%
of  The Eleventh House .

00:03:44.858 --> 00:03:47.093 align:middle line:84%
Well, we've relocated from
the capital, and here we are

00:03:47.093 --> 00:03:48.962 align:middle line:84%
at the Spider House
Cafe in Austin,

00:03:48.962 --> 00:03:52.665 align:middle line:84%
one of Austin's more
eclectic coffeehouses.

00:03:52.665 --> 00:03:54.968 align:middle line:84%
You can see all around
here we've got retro

00:03:54.968 --> 00:03:58.371 align:middle line:84%
and reclaimed art, and it
has a very unique feel.

00:03:58.371 --> 00:04:00.874 align:middle line:84%
And today the Spider House
Cafe is  The Eleventh House ,

00:04:00.874 --> 00:04:04.144 align:middle line:84%
and we're going to be talking
about this man, John F. Kennedy.

00:04:04.144 --> 00:04:07.180 align:middle line:84%
We're in the 50th anniversary
of the death of John F. Kennedy.

00:04:07.180 --> 00:04:09.683 align:middle line:84%
And we're going to
get into the astrology

00:04:09.683 --> 00:04:13.186 align:middle line:84%
of Kennedy the day he
died, and we're going

00:04:13.186 --> 00:04:17.656 align:middle line:84%
to explore both Gemini
and Aquarius as it relates

00:04:17.656 --> 00:04:22.796 align:middle line:84%
to the Gemini timeline, or the
split, or the alternate timeline

00:04:22.796 --> 00:04:24.030 align:middle line:90%
that we're now occupying.

00:04:24.030 --> 00:04:26.933 align:middle line:84%
And when you see this it
will all fit together,

00:04:26.933 --> 00:04:28.301 align:middle line:84%
and it will make
sense, trust me.

00:04:28.301 --> 00:04:29.402 align:middle line:84%
I'm just going to take
you on a little bit

00:04:29.402 --> 00:04:32.205 align:middle line:84%
of a journey here,
but there's Kennedy.

00:04:32.205 --> 00:04:32.772 align:middle line:90%
That's him.

00:04:32.772 --> 00:04:34.474 align:middle line:90%
That's the man.

00:04:34.474 --> 00:04:36.042 align:middle line:90%
And here's his chart.

00:04:36.042 --> 00:04:38.278 align:middle line:90%
It's a really interesting chart.

00:04:38.278 --> 00:04:40.413 align:middle line:84%
You know here we have
Libra on the ascendant

00:04:40.413 --> 00:04:43.516 align:middle line:84%
which made him incredibly
affable and charming.

00:04:43.516 --> 00:04:45.452 align:middle line:90%
We have Cancer on the Midheaven,

00:04:45.452 --> 00:04:49.522 align:middle line:84%
and you know the United
States is a Cancer country.

00:04:49.522 --> 00:04:54.861 align:middle line:84%
So his destiny was definitely
with the United States, that --

00:04:54.861 --> 00:04:57.530 align:middle line:84%
that it was going
to be fulfilled

00:04:57.530 --> 00:04:59.632 align:middle line:90%
through him in the Midheaven.

00:04:59.632 --> 00:05:02.936 align:middle line:84%
There's the -- there's the
first house, the 12th house,

00:05:02.936 --> 00:05:05.205 align:middle line:84%
the 11th house -- that
10th house is Leo.

00:05:05.205 --> 00:05:08.541 align:middle line:84%
But right there at the edge
of Cancer is his Midheaven.

00:05:08.541 --> 00:05:11.010 align:middle line:84%
Now he also has his
sun, Gemini sun --

00:05:11.010 --> 00:05:12.812 align:middle line:90%
remember that, Gemini sun.

00:05:12.812 --> 00:05:18.818 align:middle line:84%
And his Gemini sun is over
here in the 8th house.

00:05:18.818 --> 00:05:21.454 align:middle line:90%
The 8th house is a hidden house.

00:05:21.454 --> 00:05:27.394 align:middle line:84%
Like the 12th house it is
hidden, and there are aspects

00:05:27.394 --> 00:05:31.131 align:middle line:84%
of the character that are not
revealed or easily revealed

00:05:31.131 --> 00:05:33.466 align:middle line:84%
when the sun is in
the 8th house.

00:05:33.466 --> 00:05:37.337 align:middle line:84%
It gives the individual a
Scorpionic kind of flair.

00:05:37.337 --> 00:05:41.374 align:middle line:84%
And also when the sun is
in the 8th house it --

00:05:41.374 --> 00:05:43.576 align:middle line:84%
there is mystery
around paternity,

00:05:43.576 --> 00:05:47.113 align:middle line:84%
secrets around the father and
secrets around progeny as well.

00:05:47.113 --> 00:05:49.382 align:middle line:84%
Here is a -- a little bit of
a secret, although if you went

00:05:49.382 --> 00:05:52.852 align:middle line:84%
onto Wikipedia you'd probably
find it, but you might not know

00:05:52.852 --> 00:05:56.256 align:middle line:84%
that JFK's father Joe
Kennedy left Boston,

00:05:56.256 --> 00:05:59.225 align:middle line:84%
and went to Hollywood,
and started RKO pictures.

00:05:59.225 --> 00:06:01.528 align:middle line:84%
If you watch Turner
Classic Movies you'll see

00:06:01.528 --> 00:06:03.997 align:middle line:84%
that RKO pictures
is quite prominent.

00:06:03.997 --> 00:06:05.398 align:middle line:90%
He started RKO.

00:06:05.398 --> 00:06:08.067 align:middle line:84%
He got into the -- the theater
business because there was a lot

00:06:08.067 --> 00:06:10.103 align:middle line:84%
of money being made with
theaters being put all

00:06:10.103 --> 00:06:11.771 align:middle line:90%
around the country at that time.

00:06:11.771 --> 00:06:16.743 align:middle line:84%
And he had a love affair with a
very popular actress of his day.

00:06:16.743 --> 00:06:18.478 align:middle line:84%
In fact, she was
a blonde actress.

00:06:18.478 --> 00:06:20.413 align:middle line:90%
Her name was Gloria Swanson,

00:06:20.413 --> 00:06:23.249 align:middle line:84%
and just like his old
man John F. Kennedy,

00:06:23.249 --> 00:06:27.153 align:middle line:84%
Jr. [sic] had an affair with
a very popular blonde actress

00:06:27.153 --> 00:06:31.357 align:middle line:84%
of his day, Marilyn Monroe, who
also happens to be a Gemini.

00:06:31.357 --> 00:06:35.228 align:middle line:84%
Now we also see here that
there's Venus in the 8th house.

00:06:35.228 --> 00:06:38.531 align:middle line:84%
And Venus in the 8th house also
represents secret relationships

00:06:38.531 --> 00:06:41.835 align:middle line:84%
as well that you would not
necessarily know very much

00:06:41.835 --> 00:06:44.370 align:middle line:84%
about you know what
that person was doing

00:06:44.370 --> 00:06:45.705 align:middle line:90%
or who they were seeing.

00:06:45.705 --> 00:06:48.708 align:middle line:84%
And both of them square the
moon over in the 11th house.

00:06:48.708 --> 00:06:51.644 align:middle line:84%
The 11th house of course
being the house of Aquarius

00:06:51.644 --> 00:06:52.912 align:middle line:90%
that will come up quite a bit.

00:06:52.912 --> 00:06:57.517 align:middle line:84%
So sun square moon, Venus
square moon, hard angles.

00:06:57.517 --> 00:07:02.622 align:middle line:84%
And these hard angles
often are the dynamic force

00:07:02.622 --> 00:07:05.592 align:middle line:84%
through which a chart is
enacted, or with somebody who's

00:07:05.592 --> 00:07:10.296 align:middle line:84%
as big as Kennedy through which
the chart of the world or the --

00:07:10.296 --> 00:07:14.567 align:middle line:84%
the Anima mundi can also
be activated as well.

00:07:17.937 --> 00:07:20.640 align:middle line:84%
Now this is Mary
Cord Meyer [sic].

00:07:20.640 --> 00:07:23.276 align:middle line:84%
This is -- this is the woman
I was going to tell you

00:07:23.276 --> 00:07:26.279 align:middle line:84%
about as it relates to
the Libra ascendant.

00:07:26.279 --> 00:07:29.349 align:middle line:84%
She's a Libra, and of course
she would have a very strong

00:07:29.349 --> 00:07:33.052 align:middle line:84%
influence on JFK's life with
her wun in the first house.

00:07:33.052 --> 00:07:34.420 align:middle line:90%
That's how it works.

00:07:34.420 --> 00:07:36.155 align:middle line:84%
If you have a relationship
with somebody,

00:07:36.155 --> 00:07:38.958 align:middle line:84%
you're in a relationship with
someone, and their sun shows

00:07:38.958 --> 00:07:42.028 align:middle line:84%
up in your first house there's a
very good chance you'll be very

00:07:42.028 --> 00:07:45.431 align:middle line:84%
attracted to the person, and
that they will bring light,

00:07:45.431 --> 00:07:49.102 align:middle line:84%
and guidance, and generally
blessings to your life.

00:07:49.102 --> 00:07:50.069 align:middle line:90%
Now here she is.

00:07:50.069 --> 00:07:52.171 align:middle line:84%
The man next to her
is her husband.

00:07:52.171 --> 00:07:55.808 align:middle line:84%
That's Cord Meyer; he's the
head of the CIA, and here's JFK

00:07:55.808 --> 00:07:59.712 align:middle line:84%
over here looking quite
fondly at Mary Cord Meyer.

00:07:59.712 --> 00:08:01.014 align:middle line:90%
They were lovers.

00:08:01.014 --> 00:08:05.118 align:middle line:84%
And not only were they
lovers but the circumstances

00:08:05.118 --> 00:08:07.754 align:middle line:84%
under which they were
lovers is quite fascinating.

00:08:07.754 --> 00:08:11.591 align:middle line:84%
Now rumor has it that she
was friends with this man,

00:08:11.591 --> 00:08:14.027 align:middle line:84%
this is Timothy Leary,
also a Libra.

00:08:14.027 --> 00:08:16.396 align:middle line:84%
Tim Leary was working
with the CIA at the time,

00:08:16.396 --> 00:08:21.834 align:middle line:84%
and he was in charge of the
CIA's research project on LSD.

00:08:21.834 --> 00:08:26.773 align:middle line:84%
And Mary Cord Meyer along with
a number of other wives, women,

00:08:26.773 --> 00:08:32.245 align:middle line:84%
in Washington at that time,
were rumored to be getting LSD,

00:08:32.245 --> 00:08:36.049 align:middle line:84%
pure grade LSD, from this
man and turning people on.

00:08:36.049 --> 00:08:39.152 align:middle line:84%
Of course one of the people that
it's rumored that she turned

00:08:39.152 --> 00:08:41.721 align:middle line:90%
on was John F. Kennedy.

00:08:41.721 --> 00:08:44.257 align:middle line:84%
Now what happened
when Kennedy took LSD?

00:08:44.257 --> 00:08:47.961 align:middle line:84%
I'm sure he had a number of
epiphanies about what he'd

00:08:47.961 --> 00:08:52.364 align:middle line:84%
like to do not only for the
country but for the world.

00:08:52.364 --> 00:08:56.069 align:middle line:84%
Unfortunately Mary Cord
Myer wound up dead,

00:08:56.069 --> 00:09:00.607 align:middle line:84%
mysteriously dead, just
months after the death of JFK,

00:09:00.607 --> 00:09:02.775 align:middle line:84%
so we'll never get
the full story.

00:09:02.775 --> 00:09:05.345 align:middle line:84%
And I believe Cord
Myers' gone as well.

00:09:05.345 --> 00:09:07.046 align:middle line:84%
But it's an interesting
sidelight,

00:09:07.046 --> 00:09:08.247 align:middle line:84%
and I think a very
important one.

00:09:08.247 --> 00:09:12.352 align:middle line:84%
Ah! And there's this
man, George H. W. Bush.

00:09:12.352 --> 00:09:14.020 align:middle line:90%
Now it's rumored that --

00:09:14.020 --> 00:09:16.389 align:middle line:84%
well, he was head of
the CIA at one point.

00:09:16.389 --> 00:09:19.926 align:middle line:84%
But it's rumored that he
was actually in Dallas

00:09:19.926 --> 00:09:23.696 align:middle line:84%
around Dealey Plaza at the
time of the assassination

00:09:23.696 --> 00:09:27.500 align:middle line:84%
and might have even had a hand
in it, a helping hand in it.

00:09:27.500 --> 00:09:30.269 align:middle line:84%
George H. W. Bush
happens to be a Gemini,

00:09:30.269 --> 00:09:33.573 align:middle line:84%
so we're seeing a pattern
and a theme here with Gemini.

00:09:33.573 --> 00:09:35.775 align:middle line:90%
Gemini again represents duality.

00:09:35.775 --> 00:09:41.114 align:middle line:84%
It represents split persona,
split personality, secret lives.

00:09:41.114 --> 00:09:43.983 align:middle line:84%
It represents the
Twin Towers, hey.

00:09:43.983 --> 00:09:46.586 align:middle line:84%
It also represents
the Boaz and Jachin.

00:09:46.586 --> 00:09:49.322 align:middle line:84%
These are the twin pillars
of mystery and wisdom

00:09:49.322 --> 00:09:52.792 align:middle line:84%
that are associated
with secret societies

00:09:52.792 --> 00:09:55.261 align:middle line:84%
and other organizations and
groups that are connected

00:09:55.261 --> 00:09:58.298 align:middle line:84%
to Enochian and Babylonian
magic.

00:09:58.298 --> 00:10:00.299 align:middle line:90%
So here we go.

00:10:00.299 --> 00:10:02.869 align:middle line:84%
Here's a picture of Dallas which
is where -- it's not really --

00:10:02.869 --> 00:10:05.004 align:middle line:84%
that's a picture and
kind of an illustration.

00:10:05.004 --> 00:10:07.540 align:middle line:84%
Of course Dallas is
were JFK was killed.

00:10:07.540 --> 00:10:10.943 align:middle line:84%
Just -- just below the
33rd degree parallel,

00:10:10.943 --> 00:10:13.079 align:middle line:90%
32 degrees, what do we see here?

00:10:13.079 --> 00:10:15.948 align:middle line:84%
We see the two Ls right
in the center of Dallas.

00:10:15.948 --> 00:10:17.250 align:middle line:90%
And what do they look like?

00:10:17.250 --> 00:10:20.820 align:middle line:84%
They look like-- yes,
you got it, twin towers.

00:10:20.820 --> 00:10:24.891 align:middle line:84%
Now here is JFK in
the motorcade,

00:10:24.891 --> 00:10:27.694 align:middle line:84%
and this is just before
he's about to be killed.

00:10:27.694 --> 00:10:30.530 align:middle line:84%
And this is where --
this is just moments --

00:10:30.530 --> 00:10:33.533 align:middle line:84%
this is from the Zapruder
film -- this is just moments,

00:10:33.533 --> 00:10:38.404 align:middle line:84%
seconds, seconds from
when everything changes.

00:10:38.404 --> 00:10:40.940 align:middle line:84%
When everything we
know and the vector

00:10:40.940 --> 00:10:44.744 align:middle line:84%
through which JFK was
going to basically lead us

00:10:44.744 --> 00:10:47.980 align:middle line:84%
through this kind of
abyss, this darkness.

00:10:47.980 --> 00:10:49.749 align:middle line:84%
You know just before
he died he talked

00:10:49.749 --> 00:10:55.088 align:middle line:84%
about a terrible conspiracy that
is -- that is in this world,

00:10:55.088 --> 00:10:58.458 align:middle line:84%
and that incredibly
powerful people shudder

00:10:58.458 --> 00:11:01.527 align:middle line:84%
at the mere mention
of this conspiracy.

00:11:01.527 --> 00:11:05.365 align:middle line:84%
Well it wasn't long before --
long after that that perhaps

00:11:05.365 --> 00:11:08.534 align:middle line:84%
that conspiracy caught
up with him.

00:11:11.704 --> 00:11:16.008 align:middle line:84%
Now this is the chart for the
-- the day that JFK was killed.

00:11:16.008 --> 00:11:19.078 align:middle line:84%
Not just the day, the
exact moment of his death.

00:11:19.078 --> 00:11:21.147 align:middle line:84%
And what's fascinating
about this chart is

00:11:21.147 --> 00:11:24.917 align:middle line:84%
that you'll see here that
Aquarius is on the ascendant.

00:11:24.917 --> 00:11:27.553 align:middle line:90%
Now Aquarius is about utopia;

00:11:27.553 --> 00:11:31.491 align:middle line:84%
it's about you know
brotherhood, sisterhood.

00:11:31.491 --> 00:11:32.658 align:middle line:90%
Everybody gets along.

00:11:32.658 --> 00:11:34.127 align:middle line:90%
It's unicorns; it's rainbows.

00:11:34.127 --> 00:11:35.595 align:middle line:90%
Everybody gets a medal.

00:11:35.595 --> 00:11:39.198 align:middle line:84%
That's what Aquarius is
kind of on a mundane level.

00:11:39.198 --> 00:11:42.902 align:middle line:84%
On a higher level it represents
kind of the liberation

00:11:42.902 --> 00:11:47.106 align:middle line:84%
from society, from the yoke
of Capricorn and the ascent

00:11:47.106 --> 00:11:50.276 align:middle line:84%
of the material world,
and government,

00:11:50.276 --> 00:11:52.245 align:middle line:90%
and high finance, and business.

00:11:52.245 --> 00:11:56.649 align:middle line:84%
And once we move beyond that,
and once we move beyond the --

00:11:56.649 --> 00:12:00.153 align:middle line:84%
the labors of that with
technology in hand,

00:12:00.153 --> 00:12:02.789 align:middle line:84%
theoretically we
have all the tools

00:12:02.789 --> 00:12:05.191 align:middle line:90%
and all the enlightened wisdom

00:12:05.191 --> 00:12:09.162 align:middle line:84%
to lead our lives equitably,
fairly, and lovingly.

00:12:09.162 --> 00:12:12.298 align:middle line:84%
That's what the promise
of the Aquarian Age is.

00:12:12.298 --> 00:12:14.100 align:middle line:84%
Now here we see right
at the time

00:12:14.100 --> 00:12:16.402 align:middle line:84%
of death Aquarius
is on the ascendant.

00:12:16.402 --> 00:12:17.270 align:middle line:90%
And what we have here?

00:12:17.270 --> 00:12:18.137 align:middle line:90%
We have Saturn.

00:12:18.137 --> 00:12:20.406 align:middle line:90%
Saturn is the lord of time.

00:12:20.406 --> 00:12:22.475 align:middle line:84%
Saturn's the lord of
time, and right now

00:12:22.475 --> 00:12:27.313 align:middle line:84%
at this time is locking in
Aquarius at that moment.

00:12:27.313 --> 00:12:29.549 align:middle line:84%
And here we have
the moon in Aquarius

00:12:29.549 --> 00:12:30.917 align:middle line:90%
which is incredibly detached.

00:12:30.917 --> 00:12:32.652 align:middle line:90%
It's a very cool moon.

00:12:32.652 --> 00:12:35.354 align:middle line:84%
The -- the Saturn and the
moon together aren't --

00:12:35.354 --> 00:12:37.089 align:middle line:90%
aren't very warm.

00:12:37.089 --> 00:12:41.594 align:middle line:84%
It's a -- quite a dispassionate
nature in some ways.

00:12:41.594 --> 00:12:45.798 align:middle line:84%
Now the United States
itself has an Aquarian moon.

00:12:45.798 --> 00:12:47.133 align:middle line:90%
Benjamin Franklin --

00:12:47.133 --> 00:12:48.701 align:middle line:84%
we can thank Benjamin
Franklin for that.

00:12:48.701 --> 00:12:53.606 align:middle line:84%
So in some ways we're
kind of reigniting

00:12:53.606 --> 00:12:56.542 align:middle line:84%
or reincarnating the
Aquarian moon for the chart

00:12:56.542 --> 00:12:59.378 align:middle line:84%
of the United States, but
it's wedded to Saturn.

00:12:59.378 --> 00:13:01.080 align:middle line:90%
And this by the way sun --

00:13:01.080 --> 00:13:04.650 align:middle line:84%
the moon conjunct Saturn
is a sign of depression.

00:13:04.650 --> 00:13:07.620 align:middle line:84%
It is a -- a depressed
kind of aspect.

00:13:07.620 --> 00:13:13.593 align:middle line:84%
Over here we have Pluto,
and Pluto is squaring --

00:13:13.593 --> 00:13:17.296 align:middle line:84%
Pluto is squaring Mercury,
and it's -- and we have --

00:13:17.296 --> 00:13:19.999 align:middle line:90%
what is that over there?

00:13:19.999 --> 00:13:25.037 align:middle line:84%
That is Uranus, and that is
also squaring Mars and Venus.

00:13:25.037 --> 00:13:27.673 align:middle line:84%
Pluto and Uranus are
conjunct at that time.

00:13:27.673 --> 00:13:30.810 align:middle line:84%
So the Pluto-Uranus square
to Mercury, and to Mars,

00:13:30.810 --> 00:13:32.478 align:middle line:90%
and Venus is violence.

00:13:32.478 --> 00:13:36.349 align:middle line:84%
The Pluto square to Mars
is violence, sudden, quick,

00:13:36.349 --> 00:13:39.785 align:middle line:90%
and -- and fatal, obviously.

00:13:39.785 --> 00:13:42.388 align:middle line:90%
Let's move on to the next slide.

00:13:42.388 --> 00:13:43.723 align:middle line:84%
So what I'm trying
to show you here is

00:13:43.723 --> 00:13:46.259 align:middle line:84%
that when Kennedy
was killed the Age

00:13:46.259 --> 00:13:49.462 align:middle line:84%
of Aquarius was cast
at that time.

00:13:49.462 --> 00:13:52.665 align:middle line:84%
Now Kennedy was working on
something very interesting.

00:13:52.665 --> 00:13:57.536 align:middle line:84%
He was working on creating
a new type of money.

00:13:57.536 --> 00:14:02.108 align:middle line:84%
In -- in June of 1963 he had
decided that he was going

00:14:02.108 --> 00:14:04.877 align:middle line:90%
to create an executive order.

00:14:04.877 --> 00:14:09.148 align:middle line:84%
Executive Order 1111 which
would allow the United States

00:14:09.148 --> 00:14:11.951 align:middle line:84%
government to print
silver certificates.

00:14:11.951 --> 00:14:15.254 align:middle line:84%
Now what Kennedy had done
earlier is he had taken silver

00:14:15.254 --> 00:14:18.024 align:middle line:84%
out of circulation,
and as a result

00:14:18.024 --> 00:14:21.160 align:middle line:84%
of that silver was going
to be more important.

00:14:21.160 --> 00:14:24.430 align:middle line:84%
It was going to be
more valuable.

00:14:24.430 --> 00:14:28.334 align:middle line:84%
Now he had a plan for this, and
this was going to do a runaround

00:14:28.334 --> 00:14:31.637 align:middle line:84%
on the Federal Reserve,
which was a no-no.

00:14:31.637 --> 00:14:33.372 align:middle line:90%
These are the Hunt brothers.

00:14:33.372 --> 00:14:37.209 align:middle line:84%
And the Hunt brothers were
two really key figures

00:14:37.209 --> 00:14:39.111 align:middle line:90%
in Kennedy's plan.

00:14:39.111 --> 00:14:41.714 align:middle line:84%
The Hunt brothers of
course were the sons

00:14:41.714 --> 00:14:45.017 align:middle line:84%
of the Hunt oil family,
the Hunt oil dynasty.

00:14:45.017 --> 00:14:47.820 align:middle line:84%
And Texas is where the
Hunt brothers are from,

00:14:47.820 --> 00:14:51.390 align:middle line:84%
so is John Connolly, the
passenger on that car --

00:14:51.390 --> 00:14:52.892 align:middle line:90%
or in that -- in that car.

00:14:52.892 --> 00:14:55.995 align:middle line:84%
It was the Lincoln
with suicide doors

00:14:55.995 --> 00:15:00.733 align:middle line:84%
which interestingly enough Keanu
Reeves in  The Matrix  is --

00:15:00.733 --> 00:15:02.835 align:middle line:84%
rides in the beginning
of the movie.

00:15:02.835 --> 00:15:08.040 align:middle line:84%
Oh, by the way, if you
notice Keanu Reeves, AKA Neo,

00:15:08.040 --> 00:15:12.311 align:middle line:84%
if you notice his license in
The Matrix , he's born on 9/11.

00:15:12.311 --> 00:15:15.147 align:middle line:84%
Just an interesting
sidelight, pre-9/11 by the way.

00:15:15.147 --> 00:15:17.950 align:middle line:84%
So these are the Hunt
brothers and between them

00:15:17.950 --> 00:15:21.454 align:middle line:84%
and John Connolly they
were going to use the state

00:15:21.454 --> 00:15:24.557 align:middle line:84%
of Texas theoretically
as the new repository

00:15:24.557 --> 00:15:27.226 align:middle line:84%
to print these silver
certificates.

00:15:27.226 --> 00:15:31.130 align:middle line:84%
That's what was happening, and
Kennedy was going to unlock us

00:15:31.130 --> 00:15:33.632 align:middle line:84%
from the yoke of
the Federal Reserve.

00:15:33.632 --> 00:15:35.968 align:middle line:90%
Now this is later on with them.

00:15:35.968 --> 00:15:39.672 align:middle line:84%
They actually got in trouble
in the 1970s for trying

00:15:39.672 --> 00:15:41.741 align:middle line:90%
to corner the silver market.

00:15:41.741 --> 00:15:43.376 align:middle line:84%
And they get their hands
slapped, and they had

00:15:43.376 --> 00:15:45.311 align:middle line:84%
to pay a lot of fines, but
they were still rich guys

00:15:45.311 --> 00:15:47.613 align:middle line:90%
at the end of the day.

00:15:47.613 --> 00:15:51.250 align:middle line:84%
Now you're wondering why
I'm showing you the Beatles.

00:15:51.250 --> 00:15:53.586 align:middle line:84%
Well, the Beatles play
a very large role here.

00:15:53.586 --> 00:15:57.223 align:middle line:84%
Now this is  Meet the
Beatles ; it's the first record

00:15:57.223 --> 00:16:00.292 align:middle line:84%
that Americans will
hear of the Beatles.

00:16:00.292 --> 00:16:02.294 align:middle line:84%
Guess what date it
was released on?

00:16:02.294 --> 00:16:06.298 align:middle line:84%
11/22/63. This comes
out the exact same day

00:16:06.298 --> 00:16:08.534 align:middle line:90%
that JFK is assassinated.

00:16:08.534 --> 00:16:11.070 align:middle line:84%
And what we have here
is we have, you know,

00:16:11.070 --> 00:16:13.906 align:middle line:90%
all the Beatles faces in shadow.

00:16:13.906 --> 00:16:15.908 align:middle line:90%
You know again, this is duality.

00:16:15.908 --> 00:16:17.376 align:middle line:90%
This is light and dark.

00:16:17.376 --> 00:16:19.278 align:middle line:90%
This is an echo of Gemini.

00:16:19.278 --> 00:16:23.115 align:middle line:84%
Gemini by the way it is opposite
the Galactic Center which is

00:16:23.115 --> 00:16:26.519 align:middle line:84%
around 28 degrees
Sagittarius right now.

00:16:26.519 --> 00:16:29.121 align:middle line:84%
And the Galactic Center
is where we get pulsed all

00:16:29.121 --> 00:16:33.859 align:middle line:84%
of our neutrinos from the
center -- center of our galaxy.

00:16:33.859 --> 00:16:36.562 align:middle line:84%
It's really kind of the
-- the galactic brain.

00:16:36.562 --> 00:16:40.232 align:middle line:84%
And in Sagittarius the
energy is about authenticity,

00:16:40.232 --> 00:16:41.700 align:middle line:90%
and truth, and honesty.

00:16:41.700 --> 00:16:43.669 align:middle line:84%
Those are the hallmarks
of Sagittarius,

00:16:43.669 --> 00:16:46.138 align:middle line:90%
adventure, courageousness.

00:16:46.138 --> 00:16:47.739 align:middle line:90%
It's the sign of the hero.

00:16:47.739 --> 00:16:50.443 align:middle line:84%
Now on the opposite
side we have Gemini.

00:16:50.443 --> 00:16:52.978 align:middle line:84%
We have the twins
Castor and Pollux.

00:16:52.978 --> 00:16:55.448 align:middle line:90%
You know again it's duplicity.

00:16:55.448 --> 00:16:56.849 align:middle line:90%
It's duality.

00:16:56.849 --> 00:16:59.051 align:middle line:90%
It's split consciousness.

00:16:59.051 --> 00:17:02.121 align:middle line:84%
It's the bicameral
brain, and everything now

00:17:02.121 --> 00:17:04.323 align:middle line:84%
on this planet seems to
go deeper, and deeper,

00:17:04.323 --> 00:17:09.061 align:middle line:84%
and deeper into this divide,
into this dualistic divide.

00:17:09.061 --> 00:17:12.965 align:middle line:84%
And here we see the Beatles
actually personifying --

00:17:12.965 --> 00:17:15.835 align:middle line:84%
personifying -- they're the
face of this dualistic divide.

00:17:15.835 --> 00:17:19.672 align:middle line:84%
Light and shadow, light and dark
you know and it's the right eye

00:17:19.672 --> 00:17:23.275 align:middle line:84%
of each one of them
that is being shown.

00:17:23.275 --> 00:17:24.677 align:middle line:90%
Now in -- in terms

00:17:24.677 --> 00:17:28.581 align:middle line:84%
of alternative research
there is this theory

00:17:28.581 --> 00:17:31.417 align:middle line:84%
that when the left
eye is the one

00:17:31.417 --> 00:17:34.453 align:middle line:84%
that is shown you've been
initiated into the cult

00:17:34.453 --> 00:17:36.422 align:middle line:90%
of Horus and the cult of Isis.

00:17:36.422 --> 00:17:40.259 align:middle line:84%
But here we just see the
shadow and the right eye.

00:17:40.259 --> 00:17:43.996 align:middle line:84%
And of course Paul
McCartney is a Gemini.

00:17:43.996 --> 00:17:49.001 align:middle line:84%
So  Meet the Beatles , same day
that Kennedy is assassinated.

00:17:49.001 --> 00:17:51.036 align:middle line:90%
Here's Lyndon Baines Johnson.

00:17:51.036 --> 00:17:52.671 align:middle line:90%
He takes over as President,

00:17:52.671 --> 00:17:54.607 align:middle line:84%
and this is where
everything diverges.

00:17:54.607 --> 00:17:56.942 align:middle line:84%
Saturn is in Aquarius
at this time.

00:17:56.942 --> 00:17:59.879 align:middle line:84%
He wastes no time in
launching the "Great Society"

00:17:59.879 --> 00:18:03.916 align:middle line:84%
which is a synthetic
version of the Aquarian Age.

00:18:03.916 --> 00:18:05.084 align:middle line:90%
It's all governmental.

00:18:05.084 --> 00:18:07.153 align:middle line:90%
It's all top-down stuff.

00:18:07.153 --> 00:18:08.487 align:middle line:84%
Now there are some
people who say, "Hey,

00:18:08.487 --> 00:18:09.822 align:middle line:84%
the "Great Society"
was fantastic.

00:18:09.822 --> 00:18:11.257 align:middle line:90%
It was a war on poverty."

00:18:11.257 --> 00:18:13.559 align:middle line:84%
You know I don't want to
get into it too deeply

00:18:13.559 --> 00:18:15.828 align:middle line:84%
because we have a
limited amount of time,

00:18:15.828 --> 00:18:18.330 align:middle line:84%
but that takes place
on his watch.

00:18:18.330 --> 00:18:21.133 align:middle line:84%
What also takes place on
his watch is a deepening

00:18:21.133 --> 00:18:23.903 align:middle line:90%
of our commitment in Vietnam.

00:18:23.903 --> 00:18:27.306 align:middle line:84%
Now there were all these people
like Dean Rusk, and Atchison,

00:18:27.306 --> 00:18:30.075 align:middle line:84%
and the Dulles brothers,
they were all around Kennedy.

00:18:30.075 --> 00:18:32.411 align:middle line:84%
They were called the wise
men, Robert McNamara;

00:18:32.411 --> 00:18:34.513 align:middle line:84%
John Connolly was
even one of them.

00:18:34.513 --> 00:18:37.550 align:middle line:84%
Now once Kennedy was gone and
out of the way the first thing

00:18:37.550 --> 00:18:40.452 align:middle line:84%
that Lyndon Baines Johnson did
is he a rescinded Executive

00:18:40.452 --> 00:18:41.954 align:middle line:90%
Order 1111.

00:18:41.954 --> 00:18:44.056 align:middle line:90%
Got a -- he did away with it.

00:18:44.056 --> 00:18:47.927 align:middle line:84%
And the other thing that he did
is he escalated our involvement

00:18:47.927 --> 00:18:48.827 align:middle line:90%
in the Vietnam War.

00:18:48.827 --> 00:18:51.130 align:middle line:90%
It was a non-winnable war.

00:18:51.130 --> 00:18:52.932 align:middle line:90%
There were rules of engagement.

00:18:52.932 --> 00:18:55.834 align:middle line:90%
And it happened on his watch.

00:18:55.834 --> 00:19:00.105 align:middle line:84%
A Democrat, theoretically
a peace-loving Democrat.

00:19:00.105 --> 00:19:01.674 align:middle line:84%
The other thing that's
really interesting is

00:19:01.674 --> 00:19:05.778 align:middle line:84%
that Madeleine Brown who
was LBJ's mistress came

00:19:05.778 --> 00:19:07.446 align:middle line:84%
out with a book at
the end of her life

00:19:07.446 --> 00:19:10.115 align:middle line:90%
and basically said, "He did it."

00:19:10.115 --> 00:19:11.517 align:middle line:84%
He was the guy that
was involved,

00:19:11.517 --> 00:19:13.118 align:middle line:90%
that he admitted to her.

00:19:13.118 --> 00:19:14.887 align:middle line:84%
Now granted she was
his mistress,

00:19:14.887 --> 00:19:17.156 align:middle line:84%
but she was his mistress
for quite a long time,

00:19:17.156 --> 00:19:25.431 align:middle line:84%
so sometimes some of the
most interesting, innocuous,

00:19:25.431 --> 00:19:28.267 align:middle line:84%
and at times questionable
people might actually contain

00:19:28.267 --> 00:19:28.934 align:middle line:90%
some truth.

00:19:28.934 --> 00:19:29.868 align:middle line:90%
Here's the Beatles.

00:19:29.868 --> 00:19:32.471 align:middle line:84%
This happens on February
4th, 1964.

00:19:32.471 --> 00:19:34.373 align:middle line:90%
First time Ed Sullivan Show,

00:19:34.373 --> 00:19:36.842 align:middle line:84%
and February 4th
is, again, was sign?

00:19:36.842 --> 00:19:39.111 align:middle line:84%
Aquarius. And this
is really kind

00:19:39.111 --> 00:19:40.980 align:middle line:84%
of the cementing of
the Aquarian Age.

00:19:40.980 --> 00:19:43.816 align:middle line:84%
They're -- they're the pied
pipers of the Aquarian Age.

00:19:43.816 --> 00:19:46.318 align:middle line:84%
With them we will
explore many things.

00:19:46.318 --> 00:19:49.989 align:middle line:84%
We'll explore transcendental
meditation, eastern religions;

00:19:49.989 --> 00:19:54.059 align:middle line:84%
we'll explore LSD, the
psychedelic movement,

00:19:54.059 --> 00:19:57.563 align:middle line:84%
and even to a large -- to a --
to a greater extent madness.

00:19:57.563 --> 00:20:01.433 align:middle line:84%
And we'll see that in
another Beatles album.

00:20:06.438 --> 00:20:09.141 align:middle line:84%
Now here's an image
from the war in Vietnam.

00:20:09.141 --> 00:20:13.312 align:middle line:84%
Many of you who are watching
this were alive during

00:20:13.312 --> 00:20:15.614 align:middle line:84%
that time, and you can see
this every night on TV.

00:20:15.614 --> 00:20:17.783 align:middle line:84%
It was horror theater
brought home.

00:20:17.783 --> 00:20:19.251 align:middle line:84%
We don't see that
anymore with war.

00:20:19.251 --> 00:20:21.553 align:middle line:84%
In some ways it's
completely dishonest,

00:20:21.553 --> 00:20:24.223 align:middle line:84%
but there was a traumatization
happening every night,

00:20:24.223 --> 00:20:26.892 align:middle line:84%
and a desensitization
to violence.

00:20:26.892 --> 00:20:29.461 align:middle line:84%
You know it's -- it was
you know threading a --

00:20:29.461 --> 00:20:33.198 align:middle line:84%
a red line through our
lives at 6 o'clock.

00:20:33.198 --> 00:20:36.402 align:middle line:84%
And we were confronted
with these horrific images.

00:20:36.402 --> 00:20:39.872 align:middle line:84%
And to this day Vietnam
is -- is a part of our --

00:20:39.872 --> 00:20:42.508 align:middle line:84%
our history that we
haven't really reconciled,

00:20:42.508 --> 00:20:47.212 align:middle line:84%
not with the veterans, and not
with our own role in the war.

00:20:47.212 --> 00:20:52.518 align:middle line:84%
It -- to this day it is a
mark of shame on America

00:20:52.518 --> 00:20:54.320 align:middle line:84%
for a number of different
reasons.

00:20:54.320 --> 00:20:59.124 align:middle line:84%
This happens on the timeline
that begins to take place

00:20:59.124 --> 00:21:01.827 align:middle line:84%
in the death of the
wake of John F. Kennedy.

00:21:01.827 --> 00:21:04.229 align:middle line:84%
Rumor has it he was going
to get us out of Vietnam.

00:21:04.229 --> 00:21:10.135 align:middle line:84%
That's another thing
he was going to do.

00:21:10.135 --> 00:21:13.172 align:middle line:84%
Watts riots, 1965,
social unrest.

00:21:13.172 --> 00:21:18.243 align:middle line:84%
Again you have this duality,
the black-white divide.

00:21:18.243 --> 00:21:22.114 align:middle line:84%
You know the -- the racial
bifurcation really comes

00:21:22.114 --> 00:21:23.949 align:middle line:90%
to the fore during the mi-60s.

00:21:23.949 --> 00:21:26.085 align:middle line:84%
Now some people say
that -- that it had too,

00:21:26.085 --> 00:21:27.987 align:middle line:90%
that it was inevitable.

00:21:27.987 --> 00:21:32.091 align:middle line:84%
Perhaps. If Kennedy might
have been President who knows?

00:21:32.091 --> 00:21:33.759 align:middle line:84%
Who knows what would've
happened?

00:21:33.759 --> 00:21:37.429 align:middle line:84%
But this is a result again of
the chaos, and the conflict,

00:21:37.429 --> 00:21:41.533 align:middle line:84%
and the strife that
ensues in the death of JFK.

00:21:46.038 --> 00:21:47.272 align:middle line:90%
Now here's the Beatles album.

00:21:47.272 --> 00:21:48.707 align:middle line:90%
This is "The White Album."

00:21:48.707 --> 00:21:50.509 align:middle line:90%
This was released on what day?

00:21:50.509 --> 00:21:56.115 align:middle line:84%
11/22. And I believe this
is 1968 if I'm not mistaken.

00:21:56.115 --> 00:22:01.220 align:middle line:84%
11/22/68. This is "The White
Album," and this is the album

00:22:01.220 --> 00:22:06.458 align:middle line:84%
that gives us "Revolution 9"
and of course "Helter Skelter"

00:22:06.458 --> 00:22:10.429 align:middle line:84%
which becomes the psychotic
soundtrack to the mind

00:22:10.429 --> 00:22:15.634 align:middle line:84%
of one Charles Manson which in
a lot of ways signals the end

00:22:15.634 --> 00:22:17.636 align:middle line:90%
of the Summer of Love.

00:22:17.636 --> 00:22:22.408 align:middle line:84%
And Charles Manson is kind
of a -- in some ways a --

00:22:22.408 --> 00:22:24.610 align:middle line:90%
a dark Aquarian avatar.

00:22:24.610 --> 00:22:26.278 align:middle line:84%
You know he comes out
of prison, and he --

00:22:26.278 --> 00:22:30.783 align:middle line:84%
he acquires these castoffs and
misfits for the Manson Family

00:22:30.783 --> 00:22:34.686 align:middle line:84%
in the Haight-Ashbury which
was ground zero for the Summer

00:22:34.686 --> 00:22:36.522 align:middle line:90%
of Love and the epicenter

00:22:36.522 --> 00:22:40.259 align:middle line:84%
of this version of
the Aquarian Age.

00:22:40.259 --> 00:22:42.261 align:middle line:90%
Takes them out into the desert,

00:22:42.261 --> 00:22:44.229 align:middle line:84%
works their mind
was psychedelics,

00:22:44.229 --> 00:22:48.500 align:middle line:84%
and tells them he
can set them free.

00:22:48.500 --> 00:22:51.170 align:middle line:84%
This is a picture
from the Chicago --

00:22:51.170 --> 00:22:53.806 align:middle line:90%
the riots in Chicago in 1968.

00:22:53.806 --> 00:23:00.345 align:middle line:84%
It's a very heavy time, and
as a result of that election

00:23:00.345 --> 00:23:03.115 align:middle line:84%
and the failure of the
Democratic Party to do anything

00:23:03.115 --> 00:23:05.751 align:middle line:84%
about the Vietnam War,
this man is elected.

00:23:05.751 --> 00:23:07.352 align:middle line:90%
It's Richard Millhouse Nixon.

00:23:07.352 --> 00:23:11.890 align:middle line:84%
He's a Capricorn, and at
that time we have kind

00:23:11.890 --> 00:23:14.493 align:middle line:90%
of the stirrings of the neocons.

00:23:14.493 --> 00:23:17.429 align:middle line:84%
You know, young guys like
Dick Cheney, and Don Rumsfeld,

00:23:17.429 --> 00:23:19.832 align:middle line:90%
and I believe Daniel Shore.

00:23:19.832 --> 00:23:24.236 align:middle line:84%
This is where the whole
kind of neocon clan begins

00:23:24.236 --> 00:23:25.938 align:middle line:90%
to assemble in Washington, DC.

00:23:25.938 --> 00:23:29.975 align:middle line:90%
And they will show up later on.

00:23:29.975 --> 00:23:34.613 align:middle line:84%
And as a result we
have this guy.

00:23:34.613 --> 00:23:40.052 align:middle line:84%
This is George W.
Bush, and W is the son

00:23:40.052 --> 00:23:41.920 align:middle line:90%
of George H. W., obviously.

00:23:41.920 --> 00:23:43.055 align:middle line:90%
Where's the from?

00:23:43.055 --> 00:23:46.625 align:middle line:84%
He's from Texas, and he
gets elected in 2000.

00:23:46.625 --> 00:23:48.660 align:middle line:84%
It's an important time,
an important election.

00:23:48.660 --> 00:23:52.598 align:middle line:84%
Of course the election is always
in doubt with what happened

00:23:52.598 --> 00:23:54.600 align:middle line:90%
in Florida, and his brother.

00:23:54.600 --> 00:23:59.671 align:middle line:84%
But it doesn't take him long
to oversee this critical event,

00:23:59.671 --> 00:24:00.973 align:middle line:90%
and I'm talking about 9/11.

00:24:00.973 --> 00:24:03.809 align:middle line:84%
Here he is being told
by one of his aides

00:24:03.809 --> 00:24:07.279 align:middle line:84%
about the plane hitting
one of the towers,

00:24:07.279 --> 00:24:08.580 align:middle line:90%
one of the Twin Towers.

00:24:08.580 --> 00:24:11.283 align:middle line:84%
And he's reading a
book about a goat.

00:24:11.283 --> 00:24:16.255 align:middle line:84%
A goat, and of course there's
a lot of interesting symbolism

00:24:16.255 --> 00:24:19.057 align:middle line:84%
around a goat, but it's
foreshadowing Pluto

00:24:19.057 --> 00:24:22.161 align:middle line:84%
and Capricorn which is the time
then we're in now, and the rise

00:24:22.161 --> 00:24:24.696 align:middle line:90%
of the corporatocratic age.

00:24:28.767 --> 00:24:31.136 align:middle line:84%
And there's this
man, Dick Cheney.

00:24:31.136 --> 00:24:34.139 align:middle line:84%
Now Dick Cheney is
in Washington thanks

00:24:34.139 --> 00:24:39.545 align:middle line:84%
to [inaudible] being elected,
and of course Cheney and a lot

00:24:39.545 --> 00:24:42.915 align:middle line:84%
of his buddies have connections
through Reagan all the way back

00:24:42.915 --> 00:24:44.983 align:middle line:90%
to the Nixon Administration.

00:24:44.983 --> 00:24:49.388 align:middle line:84%
Cheney is an Aquarian, so here
we have [laughter] you know

00:24:49.388 --> 00:24:51.857 align:middle line:84%
somebody Aquarian
and very influential.

00:24:51.857 --> 00:24:54.092 align:middle line:84%
And by the way Ronald Reagan
was an Aquarian as well.

00:24:54.092 --> 00:24:57.930 align:middle line:84%
But here's Cheney, an
Aquarian, very influential,

00:24:57.930 --> 00:25:01.233 align:middle line:90%
and kind of being the --

00:25:01.233 --> 00:25:04.836 align:middle line:84%
the executor or the guy
who's initiating a --

00:25:04.836 --> 00:25:07.339 align:middle line:84%
a one-world or new world
order because that's

00:25:07.339 --> 00:25:10.275 align:middle line:84%
where we are right now as a
result of the domino effect

00:25:10.275 --> 00:25:13.445 align:middle line:84%
from the -- the war in
Iraq, and Afghanistan,

00:25:13.445 --> 00:25:14.680 align:middle line:90%
and the War of Terror.

00:25:14.680 --> 00:25:15.847 align:middle line:90%
So there's Dick Cheney.

00:25:15.847 --> 00:25:18.150 align:middle line:84%
So do you see where
this is going?

00:25:18.150 --> 00:25:20.819 align:middle line:84%
It's just -- it keeps getting
worse [laughter], and worse,

00:25:20.819 --> 00:25:23.789 align:middle line:84%
and worse, and going into
deeper and deeper straits.

00:25:23.789 --> 00:25:28.961 align:middle line:84%
Now in the 1990s we had a lot --
we had a lot of relative wealth.

00:25:28.961 --> 00:25:30.362 align:middle line:90%
People were working.

00:25:30.362 --> 00:25:34.132 align:middle line:84%
It was a -- more or less a
happy time for the most part.

00:25:34.132 --> 00:25:36.134 align:middle line:90%
Clinton was the President.

00:25:36.134 --> 00:25:38.170 align:middle line:90%
But we have these guys.

00:25:38.170 --> 00:25:40.272 align:middle line:90%
These are the Twin Towers.

00:25:40.272 --> 00:25:42.107 align:middle line:84%
And what are they a
representative of?

00:25:42.107 --> 00:25:43.875 align:middle line:84%
The sign of Gemini,
that's right.

00:25:43.875 --> 00:25:46.278 align:middle line:90%
They are duality.

00:25:46.278 --> 00:25:51.483 align:middle line:84%
They are markers in time, and
they are going to be eradicated

00:25:51.483 --> 00:25:54.553 align:middle line:84%
because we need to be able to
-- or somebody needs to be able

00:25:54.553 --> 00:25:56.388 align:middle line:90%
to continue this timeline.

00:25:56.388 --> 00:26:01.760 align:middle line:84%
We would start it on 11/22/63,
there has to be some kind

00:26:01.760 --> 00:26:04.429 align:middle line:84%
of continuation, some
kind of mirror event

00:26:04.429 --> 00:26:06.798 align:middle line:90%
that takes place out of this.

00:26:11.003 --> 00:26:13.305 align:middle line:84%
Here we have the
of course the --

00:26:13.305 --> 00:26:14.539 align:middle line:84%
the first tower's
already been hit;

00:26:14.539 --> 00:26:16.775 align:middle line:84%
the second tower's
about to be hit.

00:26:16.775 --> 00:26:23.715 align:middle line:84%
And as a result of which we have
all of this incredible rubble.

00:26:23.715 --> 00:26:25.584 align:middle line:84%
What's fascinating
about the rubble is

00:26:25.584 --> 00:26:27.386 align:middle line:90%
that they have not found --

00:26:27.386 --> 00:26:29.588 align:middle line:84%
or they didn't find
very many desks,

00:26:29.588 --> 00:26:31.857 align:middle line:84%
very many telephones,
very many computers.

00:26:31.857 --> 00:26:35.093 align:middle line:90%
It was mostly rebar and dust.

00:26:35.093 --> 00:26:37.362 align:middle line:90%
Something very powerful had

00:26:37.362 --> 00:26:40.132 align:middle line:84%
to eliminate all those
extraneous items,

00:26:40.132 --> 00:26:43.235 align:middle line:84%
or maybe those extraneous
items didn't exist at all.

00:26:43.235 --> 00:26:45.003 align:middle line:90%
Now what happens out of 9/11?

00:26:45.003 --> 00:26:47.873 align:middle line:90%
Well, we have our next Vietnam.

00:26:47.873 --> 00:26:50.942 align:middle line:90%
Here we go -- oh, before --

00:26:50.942 --> 00:26:52.444 align:middle line:84%
before we get to
the next Vietnam,

00:26:52.444 --> 00:26:53.945 align:middle line:90%
this is Larry Silverstein.

00:26:53.945 --> 00:26:56.448 align:middle line:84%
He's the guy that
owned the Twin Towers.

00:26:56.448 --> 00:26:57.749 align:middle line:90%
And by the way, if you were

00:26:57.749 --> 00:27:00.018 align:middle line:84%
to guess what sign he
is what would you say?

00:27:00.018 --> 00:27:03.055 align:middle line:84%
If you said Gemini you'd
be absolutely correct.

00:27:03.055 --> 00:27:05.724 align:middle line:84%
He's the guy that said
pull building number seven.

00:27:05.724 --> 00:27:08.760 align:middle line:84%
And we didn't have the silver
certificates with Kennedy,

00:27:08.760 --> 00:27:10.796 align:middle line:90%
but we have Silverstein.

00:27:15.400 --> 00:27:16.768 align:middle line:90%
Now here is the new Vietnam.

00:27:16.768 --> 00:27:17.736 align:middle line:90%
It's the War on Terror.

00:27:17.736 --> 00:27:18.837 align:middle line:90%
It's the war in Afghanistan.

00:27:18.837 --> 00:27:21.206 align:middle line:90%
It's the war in Iraq.

00:27:21.206 --> 00:27:23.075 align:middle line:84%
And this -- these
are the images.

00:27:23.075 --> 00:27:25.510 align:middle line:84%
These are the images
that we receive,

00:27:25.510 --> 00:27:27.646 align:middle line:90%
or we received during that time.

00:27:27.646 --> 00:27:29.414 align:middle line:90%
And we got these not necessarily

00:27:29.414 --> 00:27:30.949 align:middle line:84%
on the nightly news every
night, but they came.

00:27:30.949 --> 00:27:33.452 align:middle line:84%
And they came in bursts,
and they were horrific.

00:27:33.452 --> 00:27:36.354 align:middle line:84%
And all the good will
that America had accrued

00:27:36.354 --> 00:27:40.325 align:middle line:84%
as being the victims of
9/11 went away very quickly

00:27:40.325 --> 00:27:43.328 align:middle line:84%
when the rest of
the world saw this.

00:27:43.328 --> 00:27:51.169 align:middle line:84%
And this. This is the
demoralization of consciousness.

00:27:51.169 --> 00:27:53.805 align:middle line:84%
This is [inaudible],
and this is even worse

00:27:53.805 --> 00:27:55.941 align:middle line:90%
in some ways than Vietnam.

00:27:55.941 --> 00:27:58.944 align:middle line:84%
We didn't see our troops in
Vietnam do anything like this.

00:27:58.944 --> 00:28:01.613 align:middle line:84%
This was -- if they did
it was hidden from us.

00:28:01.613 --> 00:28:07.586 align:middle line:84%
This is the dark shadow and
the scab of the War on Terror

00:28:07.586 --> 00:28:10.222 align:middle line:84%
and the war in Afghanistan
and Iraq.

00:28:10.222 --> 00:28:14.760 align:middle line:84%
Now we also have Guantanamo
as a result of, again, 9/11.

00:28:14.760 --> 00:28:16.495 align:middle line:90%
Guantanamo was always there,

00:28:16.495 --> 00:28:17.796 align:middle line:84%
but they just turned
it into a prison.

00:28:17.796 --> 00:28:21.266 align:middle line:84%
So these are the images
that we're being inculcated

00:28:21.266 --> 00:28:25.337 align:middle line:84%
with during that
time, the new Vietnam.

00:28:25.337 --> 00:28:28.640 align:middle line:84%
The repetition, the
repeat of the timeline.

00:28:28.640 --> 00:28:29.741 align:middle line:90%
Where do they keep all --

00:28:29.741 --> 00:28:31.810 align:middle line:84%
a lot of that rubble,
like the big chunks?

00:28:31.810 --> 00:28:33.345 align:middle line:90%
The big pieces?

00:28:33.345 --> 00:28:35.080 align:middle line:90%
Right here.

00:28:35.080 --> 00:28:36.414 align:middle line:90%
Guess where it is?

00:28:36.414 --> 00:28:38.216 align:middle line:90%
It's at JFK Airport.

00:28:38.216 --> 00:28:39.885 align:middle line:90%
Get it? JFK.

00:28:39.885 --> 00:28:48.660 align:middle line:84%
And the company that used to
own this hangar was Tower Air.

00:28:48.660 --> 00:28:50.495 align:middle line:90%
Tower Air, JFK Airport.

00:28:50.495 --> 00:28:52.264 align:middle line:90%
This is hangar 17.

00:28:52.264 --> 00:28:53.665 align:middle line:90%
17 is an interesting number

00:28:53.665 --> 00:28:57.269 align:middle line:84%
because in the Major
Arcana it is the star card.

00:28:57.269 --> 00:28:58.770 align:middle line:84%
Here we have the
five-pointed star.

00:28:58.770 --> 00:29:01.106 align:middle line:84%
This is actually from
the state of Texas.

00:29:01.106 --> 00:29:02.841 align:middle line:84%
So we have a reverberation
here from the state

00:29:02.841 --> 00:29:05.310 align:middle line:90%
of Texas, five-pointed star.

00:29:05.310 --> 00:29:07.846 align:middle line:84%
There's another example of the
five-pointed star, this is --

00:29:07.846 --> 00:29:15.220 align:middle line:84%
right here that should be  The
Universal Man  by Davinci.

00:29:15.220 --> 00:29:17.489 align:middle line:84%
Remember, the star
is the symbol of man.

00:29:17.489 --> 00:29:19.124 align:middle line:90%
The number of man is five.

00:29:19.124 --> 00:29:21.693 align:middle line:84%
Here we go,  Universal
Man , Davinci,

00:29:21.693 --> 00:29:26.064 align:middle line:84%
again displaying the basic
nature of the five-pointed star,

00:29:26.064 --> 00:29:30.368 align:middle line:84%
but also its extensions
and offshoots.

00:29:30.368 --> 00:29:35.607 align:middle line:84%
Here we have a -- this
is an alchemical symbol

00:29:35.607 --> 00:29:37.409 align:middle line:90%
from the Middle Ages.

00:29:37.409 --> 00:29:39.177 align:middle line:84%
Again, the five-pointed
star of man.

00:29:39.177 --> 00:29:42.013 align:middle line:84%
And we see the alchemical
marriage with the sun

00:29:42.013 --> 00:29:45.350 align:middle line:84%
and the moon together, and the
entire cosmos, man right here

00:29:45.350 --> 00:29:46.418 align:middle line:90%
in the center of the Earth,

00:29:46.418 --> 00:29:48.887 align:middle line:84%
and the entire cosmos
actually rotating

00:29:48.887 --> 00:29:50.589 align:middle line:84%
around the Earth
believe it or not.

00:29:50.589 --> 00:29:55.160 align:middle line:84%
Not around the sun,
but around the Earth.

00:29:55.160 --> 00:29:59.231 align:middle line:84%
And lastly this is
the star card.

00:29:59.231 --> 00:30:02.801 align:middle line:84%
This is number 17
in the Major Arcana.

00:30:02.801 --> 00:30:05.604 align:middle line:84%
And what sign does the
star card represent?

00:30:05.604 --> 00:30:11.109 align:middle line:84%
Aquarius. So again we have this
kind of wave that is both dual,

00:30:11.109 --> 00:30:14.012 align:middle line:90%
Gemini, and this kind

00:30:14.012 --> 00:30:17.315 align:middle line:84%
of synthetic version
of the Aquarian Age.

00:30:17.315 --> 00:30:19.751 align:middle line:84%
And we're going to get into that
a little bit deeper as we --

00:30:19.751 --> 00:30:22.787 align:middle line:84%
we get to the end of
this presentation.

00:30:22.787 --> 00:30:24.956 align:middle line:84%
Now this is for the
lunar eclipse --

00:30:24.956 --> 00:30:28.760 align:middle line:84%
I'm sorry, the solar eclipse
on the 3rd of November.

00:30:28.760 --> 00:30:30.896 align:middle line:90%
And this is for New York.

00:30:30.896 --> 00:30:32.797 align:middle line:84%
And it's -- it's an
interesting and solar eclipse.

00:30:32.797 --> 00:30:33.999 align:middle line:90%
It's a hybrid eclipse.

00:30:33.999 --> 00:30:36.768 align:middle line:84%
It starts in Florida, and
then it goes all the way

00:30:36.768 --> 00:30:40.038 align:middle line:84%
across to Africa,
and covers Africa.

00:30:40.038 --> 00:30:42.507 align:middle line:84%
Now you can see up here,
this is the Midheaven.

00:30:42.507 --> 00:30:45.877 align:middle line:84%
We have all these planets
in Scorpio in the Midheaven.

00:30:45.877 --> 00:30:49.714 align:middle line:84%
It's a really interesting
aggregation of planets.

00:30:49.714 --> 00:30:52.751 align:middle line:84%
And this -- the Midheaven
here, this is the --

00:30:52.751 --> 00:30:55.487 align:middle line:90%
this is the -- the 10th house.

00:30:55.487 --> 00:30:56.821 align:middle line:90%
Actually, this is the 9th house.

00:30:56.821 --> 00:30:58.189 align:middle line:90%
It's slanted a bit.

00:30:58.189 --> 00:30:59.424 align:middle line:90%
So this is the 9th house.

00:30:59.424 --> 00:31:00.992 align:middle line:90%
This is Sagittarius.

00:31:00.992 --> 00:31:04.062 align:middle line:84%
And Sagittarius, again if we
go back to the Galactic Center,

00:31:04.062 --> 00:31:05.897 align:middle line:90%
it's all those attributes.

00:31:05.897 --> 00:31:06.731 align:middle line:90%
It's sovereignty.

00:31:06.731 --> 00:31:07.832 align:middle line:90%
It's authenticity.

00:31:07.832 --> 00:31:09.334 align:middle line:90%
It's honesty.

00:31:09.334 --> 00:31:10.702 align:middle line:90%
It's -- its heroism.

00:31:10.702 --> 00:31:12.003 align:middle line:90%
It's courage.

00:31:12.003 --> 00:31:13.338 align:middle line:90%
It's revelation.

00:31:13.338 --> 00:31:15.941 align:middle line:84%
And here we have all these
Scorpio planets which are all

00:31:15.941 --> 00:31:20.278 align:middle line:84%
about you know going into the
depth and exploring secrets

00:31:20.278 --> 00:31:25.583 align:middle line:84%
and dredging up the mystery
from the recesses of the psyche.

00:31:25.583 --> 00:31:26.952 align:middle line:90%
That's all in the 9th house.

00:31:26.952 --> 00:31:29.087 align:middle line:84%
You put those two together,
and what do we have?

00:31:29.087 --> 00:31:32.857 align:middle line:84%
We have an aggregation for
revelation, and it's part

00:31:32.857 --> 00:31:38.296 align:middle line:84%
of a very powerful series of
sextiles here sextiling off

00:31:38.296 --> 00:31:43.735 align:middle line:84%
to Mars in -- in Virgo,
and also sextiling off

00:31:43.735 --> 00:31:45.837 align:middle line:90%
into Pluto and Capricorn.

00:31:45.837 --> 00:31:49.207 align:middle line:84%
Now Pluto here is in the 12th
house, a very powerful house.

00:31:49.207 --> 00:31:50.408 align:middle line:90%
It's hidden.

00:31:50.408 --> 00:31:53.345 align:middle line:84%
It's -- it's depth -- it's
depth, it's intensity,

00:31:53.345 --> 00:31:55.947 align:middle line:90%
and it's squaring Uranus.

00:31:55.947 --> 00:31:59.050 align:middle line:84%
Now Pluto and Uranus have
been squaring off since 2009

00:31:59.050 --> 00:32:02.954 align:middle line:84%
and will continue
to do so until 2015.

00:32:02.954 --> 00:32:05.957 align:middle line:84%
This is a very dynamic
square, and Uranus

00:32:05.957 --> 00:32:09.060 align:middle line:84%
and Aries represent the
spirit of the individual.

00:32:09.060 --> 00:32:10.228 align:middle line:90%
It's the will.

00:32:10.228 --> 00:32:11.930 align:middle line:90%
And Uranus is electricity.

00:32:11.930 --> 00:32:12.597 align:middle line:90%
It's happening.

00:32:12.597 --> 00:32:13.865 align:middle line:90%
It's right now.

00:32:13.865 --> 00:32:15.467 align:middle line:90%
It is spontaneous.

00:32:15.467 --> 00:32:19.137 align:middle line:84%
One of the interesting
technologies that's emerged

00:32:19.137 --> 00:32:21.873 align:middle line:84%
through Uranus and Aries
has been the 3-D printer

00:32:21.873 --> 00:32:24.642 align:middle line:84%
which will allow individuals
to create from start

00:32:24.642 --> 00:32:27.212 align:middle line:84%
to finish objects in their
own home, and their --

00:32:27.212 --> 00:32:29.147 align:middle line:84%
their own home workshops
and garages.

00:32:29.147 --> 00:32:30.615 align:middle line:90%
That's just one aspect of it.

00:32:30.615 --> 00:32:32.550 align:middle line:84%
A lot of the revolutions
that we've seen

00:32:32.550 --> 00:32:34.953 align:middle line:84%
around the planet have
also been Uranus and Aries.

00:32:34.953 --> 00:32:37.389 align:middle line:84%
Here it's squaring off
against Pluto and Capricorn.

00:32:37.389 --> 00:32:39.991 align:middle line:84%
That is the fusion of
government and big business,

00:32:39.991 --> 00:32:41.493 align:middle line:90%
the corporatocratic state.

00:32:41.493 --> 00:32:43.194 align:middle line:90%
There's conflict here.

00:32:43.194 --> 00:32:44.629 align:middle line:90%
There's deep conflict.

00:32:44.629 --> 00:32:48.967 align:middle line:84%
So we have revelation, and
something emerges out of this --

00:32:48.967 --> 00:32:51.536 align:middle line:90%
out of this eclipse on the 3rd.

00:32:51.536 --> 00:32:55.140 align:middle line:84%
But there's also the potential
for very powerful conflict

00:32:55.140 --> 00:32:57.208 align:middle line:90%
between these two forces.

00:33:01.746 --> 00:33:05.283 align:middle line:84%
Here's a map of the eclipse that
starts right here in Florida,

00:33:05.283 --> 00:33:08.853 align:middle line:84%
and then it crosses right
through central Africa,

00:33:08.853 --> 00:33:10.855 align:middle line:84%
right through the
heart of the Mother.

00:33:10.855 --> 00:33:15.894 align:middle line:84%
And any time an eclipse goes
across a country or passes

00:33:15.894 --> 00:33:20.565 align:middle line:84%
over it pay close attention
because there can be some kind

00:33:20.565 --> 00:33:25.770 align:middle line:84%
of -- of geophysical, or
political, or cultural kind

00:33:25.770 --> 00:33:28.139 align:middle line:90%
of cataclysm that results.

00:33:28.139 --> 00:33:32.077 align:middle line:84%
And the power of the eclipse,
that will last days and weeks

00:33:32.077 --> 00:33:33.545 align:middle line:90%
after the eclipse itself.

00:33:33.545 --> 00:33:37.449 align:middle line:84%
So keep an eye on places like to
Gabon and central Africa right

00:33:37.449 --> 00:33:41.352 align:middle line:84%
through the heart of
that great continent.

00:33:41.352 --> 00:33:47.025 align:middle line:84%
Now here we have the
path of Comet ISON.

00:33:47.025 --> 00:33:48.993 align:middle line:90%
Comet ISON is very interesting.

00:33:48.993 --> 00:33:52.897 align:middle line:90%
It's called a sun grazing comet.

00:33:52.897 --> 00:33:56.434 align:middle line:84%
Theoretically it's
from the Oort cloud.

00:33:56.434 --> 00:33:57.535 align:middle line:90%
Here is the path.

00:33:57.535 --> 00:34:01.439 align:middle line:84%
It's going to be
coming around the sun,

00:34:01.439 --> 00:34:03.508 align:middle line:84%
and astronomers have
already said it's going

00:34:03.508 --> 00:34:04.309 align:middle line:90%
to make this journey.

00:34:04.309 --> 00:34:05.844 align:middle line:90%
It's periheliun.

00:34:05.844 --> 00:34:09.481 align:middle line:84%
Right there, and then in
November guess where it is?

00:34:09.481 --> 00:34:10.682 align:middle line:84%
It's right there
at Earth, right?

00:34:10.682 --> 00:34:11.683 align:middle line:90%
Right here at Earth.

00:34:11.683 --> 00:34:13.318 align:middle line:90%
ISON, by the way if you play

00:34:13.318 --> 00:34:18.188 align:middle line:84%
around with the words a little
bit also spells Sion, or Zion,

00:34:18.188 --> 00:34:20.592 align:middle line:84%
and that has some interesting
ramifications in terms

00:34:20.592 --> 00:34:24.596 align:middle line:84%
of the name, and in terms of
its symbolic significance.

00:34:24.596 --> 00:34:29.032 align:middle line:84%
So it is the return in some
ways a Zion, or Sion, or Zion,

00:34:29.032 --> 00:34:33.238 align:middle line:84%
and of course the home
of Zion is Babylon.

00:34:33.238 --> 00:34:34.438 align:middle line:90%
So here we go.

00:34:34.438 --> 00:34:36.574 align:middle line:90%
ISON coming right by us.

00:34:36.574 --> 00:34:42.280 align:middle line:84%
Now here's a -- a picture
of ISON actually in space.

00:34:42.280 --> 00:34:43.348 align:middle line:90%
That's it.

00:34:43.348 --> 00:34:44.616 align:middle line:84%
That's what it looks
like theoretically.

00:34:44.616 --> 00:34:46.684 align:middle line:84%
But there's another
really interesting picture,

00:34:46.684 --> 00:34:51.456 align:middle line:90%
and that's ISON as well.

00:34:51.456 --> 00:34:53.324 align:middle line:90%
Now this is unusual.

00:34:53.324 --> 00:34:56.795 align:middle line:84%
We have a light here, a light
here, and we have a light here.

00:34:56.795 --> 00:34:58.229 align:middle line:90%
They do not seem connected.

00:34:58.229 --> 00:35:01.099 align:middle line:84%
They seem like three
separate entities.

00:35:01.099 --> 00:35:03.434 align:middle line:84%
Now there are some
people that believe

00:35:03.434 --> 00:35:07.338 align:middle line:84%
that this is the Red
Kachina, that it is the --

00:35:07.338 --> 00:35:10.642 align:middle line:84%
the winged giant, and
it is coming our way.

00:35:10.642 --> 00:35:12.443 align:middle line:84%
Now what's really
interesting is --

00:35:12.443 --> 00:35:15.446 align:middle line:84%
is that over the
course of the last month

00:35:15.446 --> 00:35:18.283 align:middle line:90%
and a half geophysical

00:35:18.283 --> 00:35:21.853 align:middle line:84%
and seismic activity has
been off the charts on Earth.

00:35:21.853 --> 00:35:24.956 align:middle line:84%
If you haven't been tracking it
you know this is November now,

00:35:24.956 --> 00:35:30.428 align:middle line:84%
but in September Yosemite
had a 3.5 earthquake,

00:35:30.428 --> 00:35:32.163 align:middle line:84%
which is pretty high
for Yosemite.

00:35:32.163 --> 00:35:34.399 align:middle line:84%
And they had a triple
swarm of earthquakes.

00:35:34.399 --> 00:35:36.968 align:middle line:84%
Never happened before
in Yosemite.

00:35:36.968 --> 00:35:38.937 align:middle line:84%
And there have been
major earthquakes

00:35:38.937 --> 00:35:40.338 align:middle line:90%
in the month of October.

00:35:40.338 --> 00:35:45.777 align:middle line:84%
There was a big earthquake, 7.1,
and that happened in Pakistan.

00:35:45.777 --> 00:35:48.379 align:middle line:84%
And then there was a major
earthquake in the Philippines,

00:35:48.379 --> 00:35:50.915 align:middle line:84%
and another major
earthquake in Greece.

00:35:50.915 --> 00:35:53.484 align:middle line:84%
So there is geophysical and
seismic activity that --

00:35:53.484 --> 00:35:55.420 align:middle line:90%
that's really heating up.

00:35:55.420 --> 00:35:56.154 align:middle line:90%
Is it connected to ISON?

00:35:56.154 --> 00:35:58.156 align:middle line:90%
I guess we'll find out.

00:35:58.156 --> 00:36:01.292 align:middle line:84%
That's all in November
by the way.

00:36:01.292 --> 00:36:05.864 align:middle line:84%
Now this is the last thing
I'm going to tell you about.

00:36:05.864 --> 00:36:07.198 align:middle line:90%
Here's the United States,

00:36:07.198 --> 00:36:10.068 align:middle line:84%
and this is the electrical
grid of the United States.

00:36:10.068 --> 00:36:11.502 align:middle line:84%
In November guess what
they're going to do?

00:36:11.502 --> 00:36:12.704 align:middle line:90%
They're going to shut this down.

00:36:12.704 --> 00:36:14.672 align:middle line:84%
They're going to shut it
down for a couple of days.

00:36:14.672 --> 00:36:15.940 align:middle line:84%
They're going to -- no,
not a couple of days.

00:36:15.940 --> 00:36:17.475 align:middle line:84%
I'm not sure how long
they're going to shut it down,

00:36:17.475 --> 00:36:21.145 align:middle line:84%
but an extended period
of time, and you can find

00:36:21.145 --> 00:36:23.081 align:middle line:90%
out about this on the Internet.

00:36:23.081 --> 00:36:29.120 align:middle line:84%
This is to see how people
in public agencies respond

00:36:29.120 --> 00:36:33.191 align:middle line:84%
when every single grid
in this country is hit

00:36:33.191 --> 00:36:34.559 align:middle line:90%
by a power outage.

00:36:34.559 --> 00:36:37.695 align:middle line:84%
Now you could pretty much find
out how people would respond

00:36:37.695 --> 00:36:39.764 align:middle line:84%
by just doing a portion
of the grid,

00:36:39.764 --> 00:36:41.266 align:middle line:90%
but they're really going for it.

00:36:41.266 --> 00:36:45.003 align:middle line:84%
And this, I believe, is
on the 13th of November.

00:36:45.003 --> 00:36:48.773 align:middle line:84%
And there are some people
that are speculating

00:36:48.773 --> 00:36:49.841 align:middle line:90%
that when the lights come back

00:36:49.841 --> 00:36:52.377 align:middle line:84%
on this could be a
very different place.

00:36:52.377 --> 00:36:55.813 align:middle line:84%
So we have this; we have Comet
ISON; we have Mercury retrograde

00:36:55.813 --> 00:36:58.583 align:middle line:84%
which is already you
know -- had been effect.

00:36:58.583 --> 00:37:01.286 align:middle line:84%
And then we also
have the eclipse,

00:37:01.286 --> 00:37:05.223 align:middle line:84%
the solar eclipse all
happening in the same month,

00:37:05.223 --> 00:37:08.960 align:middle line:84%
the month of November, the
11th month, keep that in mind.

00:37:08.960 --> 00:37:10.895 align:middle line:90%
The number 11 very prominent.

00:37:10.895 --> 00:37:15.633 align:middle line:84%
So what I wanted to do
is I want to leave you

00:37:15.633 --> 00:37:17.969 align:middle line:84%
with a timeline that
I created here.

00:37:17.969 --> 00:37:22.473 align:middle line:84%
And this is the timeline that
existed as a result of the death

00:37:22.473 --> 00:37:26.077 align:middle line:84%
of JFK, and this is
an alternate timeline,

00:37:26.077 --> 00:37:28.880 align:middle line:84%
timeline that [laughter] we
might -- we could be living,

00:37:28.880 --> 00:37:31.449 align:middle line:84%
and every now and then pops up
through the cracks and fissures

00:37:31.449 --> 00:37:33.584 align:middle line:84%
of our consciousness
and our culture.

00:37:33.584 --> 00:37:34.786 align:middle line:90%
Let's just take a look at this.

00:37:34.786 --> 00:37:38.423 align:middle line:84%
This is the false or
this pseudo-Aquarian Age.

00:37:38.423 --> 00:37:41.993 align:middle line:84%
This is right here
surveillance as oneness.

00:37:41.993 --> 00:37:43.261 align:middle line:90%
And this is the whole idea

00:37:43.261 --> 00:37:46.564 align:middle line:84%
that the all-seeing eye can
access all, sees us all,

00:37:46.564 --> 00:37:49.867 align:middle line:84%
hears everything, and as a
result of that becomes kind

00:37:49.867 --> 00:37:52.603 align:middle line:84%
of this omniscient
force, plays God on Earth

00:37:52.603 --> 00:37:55.973 align:middle line:84%
and connects every single
one of us in a unified field

00:37:55.973 --> 00:37:58.209 align:middle line:90%
in a state of surveillance.

00:37:58.209 --> 00:38:02.313 align:middle line:84%
That is one version, very
synthetic and chilling version

00:38:02.313 --> 00:38:04.515 align:middle line:90%
of what it's like to be one.

00:38:04.515 --> 00:38:09.787 align:middle line:84%
Here we have poverty as
-- poverty as one class.

00:38:09.787 --> 00:38:12.123 align:middle line:90%
And what we're seeing here

00:38:12.123 --> 00:38:16.094 align:middle line:84%
in the United States
is we're seeing the --

00:38:16.094 --> 00:38:18.129 align:middle line:84%
the cratering of
the middle class.

00:38:18.129 --> 00:38:21.699 align:middle line:84%
Middle class keeps losing more
and more of its economic clout

00:38:21.699 --> 00:38:22.967 align:middle line:90%
and its economic power.

00:38:22.967 --> 00:38:25.203 align:middle line:84%
And it's sinking
down into the --

00:38:25.203 --> 00:38:27.939 align:middle line:84%
kind of the lower middle
class, and even the lower class

00:38:27.939 --> 00:38:29.707 align:middle line:90%
if people have taken a real hit.

00:38:29.707 --> 00:38:32.777 align:middle line:84%
Meanwhile there are countries
like Brazil, and Russia,

00:38:32.777 --> 00:38:35.747 align:middle line:84%
and India, and China, they're
known as the brick countries.

00:38:35.747 --> 00:38:37.648 align:middle line:84%
Their economic level
is going up.

00:38:37.648 --> 00:38:42.253 align:middle line:84%
So the whole idea here is to
flat line every single economy

00:38:42.253 --> 00:38:48.526 align:middle line:84%
across the world and create
one economy, one class,

00:38:48.526 --> 00:38:52.130 align:middle line:84%
and perhaps even one
currency as a result of this.

00:38:52.130 --> 00:38:53.898 align:middle line:84%
You see this is all
synthetic, right?

00:38:53.898 --> 00:38:56.501 align:middle line:84%
This is all top-down
down managed,

00:38:56.501 --> 00:38:58.903 align:middle line:90%
engineered, and manipulated.

00:38:58.903 --> 00:39:01.272 align:middle line:90%
Over here we have science.

00:39:01.272 --> 00:39:06.177 align:middle line:84%
Science replaces
nature, it's a GMO apple.

00:39:06.177 --> 00:39:10.581 align:middle line:84%
And genetically modified foods
-- and not just vegetables

00:39:10.581 --> 00:39:11.949 align:middle line:90%
or fruits, but they're talking

00:39:11.949 --> 00:39:13.885 align:middle line:84%
about genetically
modifying meats.

00:39:13.885 --> 00:39:18.356 align:middle line:84%
They're getting right down
to the DNA of everything

00:39:18.356 --> 00:39:20.758 align:middle line:84%
by genetically modifying
alfalfa.

00:39:20.758 --> 00:39:22.593 align:middle line:90%
It's replacing nature.

00:39:22.593 --> 00:39:26.731 align:middle line:84%
It's putting a synthetic
imprint over everything.

00:39:26.731 --> 00:39:29.600 align:middle line:84%
This is science dominating
nature.

00:39:29.600 --> 00:39:33.271 align:middle line:84%
This is where science becomes
our god, not nature or God

00:39:33.271 --> 00:39:36.107 align:middle line:84%
through nature, but
science itself.

00:39:36.107 --> 00:39:41.012 align:middle line:84%
And over here we have -- this
is -- this is the green utopia,

00:39:41.012 --> 00:39:45.049 align:middle line:90%
and this is controlled setting.

00:39:45.049 --> 00:39:46.184 align:middle line:90%
This is Agenda 21.

00:39:46.184 --> 00:39:49.554 align:middle line:84%
If you haven't looked at
Agenda 21 I urge you --

00:39:49.554 --> 00:39:53.691 align:middle line:84%
and this is kind of you know
if you look back at  The Wizard

00:39:53.691 --> 00:39:55.827 align:middle line:90%
of Oz  where do they live?

00:39:55.827 --> 00:39:57.995 align:middle line:84%
You know where -- where does
-- you know where do all the --

00:39:57.995 --> 00:40:00.098 align:middle line:90%
the Lilliputians live?

00:40:00.098 --> 00:40:02.033 align:middle line:84%
And -- and you know where
is it really happening?

00:40:02.033 --> 00:40:02.867 align:middle line:90%
Where does the wizard live?

00:40:02.867 --> 00:40:05.269 align:middle line:90%
It's the Emerald Kingdom, right?

00:40:05.269 --> 00:40:07.538 align:middle line:84%
It's perfect in the
Emerald Kingdom.

00:40:07.538 --> 00:40:10.775 align:middle line:84%
That's a metaphor
for Agenda 21, and --

00:40:10.775 --> 00:40:14.345 align:middle line:84%
and what I call the
-- the green utopia.

00:40:14.345 --> 00:40:18.449 align:middle line:84%
But unfortunately what comes
along with all these --

00:40:18.449 --> 00:40:22.353 align:middle line:84%
these wonderful [laughter] you
know luxuries that are quote,

00:40:22.353 --> 00:40:28.259 align:middle line:84%
unquote sustainable is also a
really controlled environment

00:40:28.259 --> 00:40:29.861 align:middle line:90%
as a result of that.

00:40:29.861 --> 00:40:33.598 align:middle line:84%
You know we are -- theoretically
as a result of Agenda 21,

00:40:33.598 --> 00:40:36.134 align:middle line:84%
you can -- you can dig
into it and find out,

00:40:36.134 --> 00:40:38.870 align:middle line:84%
are going to be kind of
[laughter] moved off the lands

00:40:38.870 --> 00:40:43.007 align:middle line:84%
and moved to these -- you know
these wonderful green centers.

00:40:43.007 --> 00:40:45.409 align:middle line:84%
So this is again
giving us kind of a --

00:40:45.409 --> 00:40:47.678 align:middle line:84%
a false sense of utopia
in some ways, and --

00:40:47.678 --> 00:40:49.614 align:middle line:84%
and giving us the
-- sort of the --

00:40:49.614 --> 00:40:52.016 align:middle line:84%
the green effect
that we can feel

00:40:52.016 --> 00:40:54.819 align:middle line:84%
like we're being responsible
stewards of the Earth,

00:40:54.819 --> 00:40:58.389 align:middle line:84%
but really what it
amounts to is kind of a --

00:40:58.389 --> 00:41:02.360 align:middle line:84%
a cushy cage in some ways with
funny-looking light bulbs.

00:41:02.360 --> 00:41:06.063 align:middle line:84%
And then the last image here is
transhumanism, the hive mind.

00:41:06.063 --> 00:41:08.099 align:middle line:84%
And this is the selling
of transhumanism,

00:41:08.099 --> 00:41:11.168 align:middle line:84%
the fusion between
synthetic consciousness

00:41:11.168 --> 00:41:12.670 align:middle line:90%
and human consciousness.

00:41:12.670 --> 00:41:15.940 align:middle line:84%
And as a result of that we
would create this hive mind

00:41:15.940 --> 00:41:19.076 align:middle line:84%
or this one mind which
again would be a pseudo

00:41:19.076 --> 00:41:21.746 align:middle line:84%
or synthetic version
of the Aquarian Age.

00:41:21.746 --> 00:41:25.316 align:middle line:84%
Now the organic version of the
Aquarian Age or the alternate,

00:41:25.316 --> 00:41:29.320 align:middle line:84%
so we have here freedom of
spirit versus surveillance

00:41:29.320 --> 00:41:31.923 align:middle line:84%
as oneness where everybody
understands their own

00:41:31.923 --> 00:41:34.025 align:middle line:84%
uniqueness, their
own authenticity,

00:41:34.025 --> 00:41:36.727 align:middle line:84%
their own spiritual nature,
their talent divine connection,

00:41:36.727 --> 00:41:40.197 align:middle line:84%
and is not mediated or
mitigated by any third party.

00:41:40.197 --> 00:41:44.569 align:middle line:84%
Here as a -- an alternative
to poverty is abundance

00:41:44.569 --> 00:41:46.938 align:middle line:84%
through service or
abundance through giving.

00:41:46.938 --> 00:41:49.640 align:middle line:84%
This is where people
understand their innate wealth,

00:41:49.640 --> 00:41:53.144 align:middle line:84%
and as a result they're willing
to share either through service

00:41:53.144 --> 00:41:54.745 align:middle line:84%
or through the sharing
of their money.

00:41:54.745 --> 00:41:56.013 align:middle line:90%
This is about a shared economy

00:41:56.013 --> 00:41:58.950 align:middle line:84%
that is voluntary
and non-forced.

00:41:58.950 --> 00:42:03.387 align:middle line:84%
But it's also a reevaluation
of value as a result of that.

00:42:03.387 --> 00:42:06.257 align:middle line:84%
Opposite science
replacing nature.

00:42:06.257 --> 00:42:07.625 align:middle line:90%
Nature is sacred.

00:42:07.625 --> 00:42:09.226 align:middle line:90%
This is where we honor nature.

00:42:09.226 --> 00:42:12.430 align:middle line:84%
This is where nature comes
into the Aquarian image

00:42:12.430 --> 00:42:13.798 align:middle line:90%
that everything is one,

00:42:13.798 --> 00:42:19.103 align:middle line:84%
that everything has its own
unique signature in our lives.

00:42:19.103 --> 00:42:24.075 align:middle line:84%
Here we have healthy
sovereign communities,

00:42:24.075 --> 00:42:26.277 align:middle line:84%
and this would be
the alternative

00:42:26.277 --> 00:42:29.280 align:middle line:84%
to the Agenda 21-based
and planned communities.

00:42:29.280 --> 00:42:30.982 align:middle line:84%
The healthy sovereign
communities are people

00:42:30.982 --> 00:42:32.316 align:middle line:90%
that work the land,

00:42:32.316 --> 00:42:36.387 align:middle line:84%
have farm-to-table
experience with their food.

00:42:36.387 --> 00:42:37.421 align:middle line:90%
They share locally.

00:42:37.421 --> 00:42:38.823 align:middle line:90%
They buy locally.

00:42:38.823 --> 00:42:41.158 align:middle line:90%
And it really is kind of a --

00:42:41.158 --> 00:42:47.198 align:middle line:84%
a reorientation of the top-down
stratification of consumerism.

00:42:47.198 --> 00:42:50.468 align:middle line:84%
And this is where
communities take responsibility

00:42:50.468 --> 00:42:52.703 align:middle line:84%
for what they provide for
themselves and for each other.

00:42:52.703 --> 00:42:55.573 align:middle line:84%
Again, this is a very
Aquarian kind of experience.

00:42:55.573 --> 00:42:58.542 align:middle line:84%
You fuse that with technology
and some of the wonderful things

00:42:58.542 --> 00:43:02.380 align:middle line:84%
that we can bring into like
hydroponics or [inaudible],

00:43:02.380 --> 00:43:06.550 align:middle line:84%
and this could be a
-- a really dynamic,

00:43:06.550 --> 00:43:09.153 align:middle line:84%
a very dynamic experience
in terms of living.

00:43:09.153 --> 00:43:13.758 align:middle line:84%
And then finally what we have
here is indigenous dream time.

00:43:13.758 --> 00:43:16.927 align:middle line:84%
And indigenous dream time
stands opposite the Borg mind

00:43:16.927 --> 00:43:19.764 align:middle line:84%
or the hive mind where
the biosynthetic mind,

00:43:19.764 --> 00:43:22.299 align:middle line:90%
the transhumanism is glorified.

00:43:22.299 --> 00:43:24.769 align:middle line:84%
And this includes
indigenous traditions.

00:43:24.769 --> 00:43:25.903 align:middle line:90%
These are the [inaudible].

00:43:25.903 --> 00:43:29.306 align:middle line:84%
These are some of the
tribes from the Amazon.

00:43:29.306 --> 00:43:32.943 align:middle line:84%
These are the aboriginal people,
especially the aboriginal people

00:43:32.943 --> 00:43:36.414 align:middle line:84%
because they connect us
into a cosmic version

00:43:36.414 --> 00:43:37.548 align:middle line:90%
of [laughter] the Internet.

00:43:37.548 --> 00:43:40.418 align:middle line:84%
They connect us into a
timeless virtual reality

00:43:40.418 --> 00:43:41.552 align:middle line:90%
through the dream time.

00:43:41.552 --> 00:43:45.523 align:middle line:84%
And this is the organic
alternate version

00:43:45.523 --> 00:43:49.126 align:middle line:84%
of the Borgian synthetic
hive mind.

00:43:49.126 --> 00:43:52.396 align:middle line:84%
So you know what's happening
is we have these cracks

00:43:52.396 --> 00:43:54.932 align:middle line:84%
and fissures almost
like deep sea bands

00:43:54.932 --> 00:43:57.668 align:middle line:84%
or what happens with
tectonic plates.

00:43:57.668 --> 00:43:59.170 align:middle line:90%
And we have these eruptions

00:43:59.170 --> 00:44:01.972 align:middle line:84%
of the Aquarian sphere
or Aquarian thinkers.

00:44:01.972 --> 00:44:04.475 align:middle line:84%
True Aquarian sphere and
true Aquarian thinkers

00:44:04.475 --> 00:44:08.579 align:middle line:84%
that bring us closer to
the potential that we have

00:44:08.579 --> 00:44:13.284 align:middle line:84%
by taking things into our own
domain, making them our known,

00:44:13.284 --> 00:44:17.021 align:middle line:84%
and sharing them with others
organically through love

00:44:17.021 --> 00:44:19.690 align:middle line:84%
and through a connection,
a divine connection

00:44:19.690 --> 00:44:23.494 align:middle line:84%
with the sacred nature of
this planet, and not something

00:44:23.494 --> 00:44:28.199 align:middle line:84%
that is imposed upon us by
a corporation, or by a bank,

00:44:28.199 --> 00:44:31.368 align:middle line:84%
or by a government,
or by a laboratory.

00:44:31.368 --> 00:44:32.903 align:middle line:90%
So where are we?

00:44:32.903 --> 00:44:36.440 align:middle line:84%
We're -- we're in November, and
we're going to find out if we're

00:44:36.440 --> 00:44:39.944 align:middle line:84%
about to hit the next
iteration or the next wrinkle

00:44:39.944 --> 00:44:46.484 align:middle line:84%
in this timeline, because after
9/11 there is a -- an ennui.

00:44:46.484 --> 00:44:49.653 align:middle line:84%
There is a -- there is a sense
of stasis that's taken place,

00:44:49.653 --> 00:44:51.989 align:middle line:84%
and people are not buying the
dominant paradigm anymore.

00:44:51.989 --> 00:44:53.290 align:middle line:90%
They're just not.

00:44:53.290 --> 00:44:55.993 align:middle line:84%
Any time some major event
happens they either get more

00:44:55.993 --> 00:44:58.829 align:middle line:84%
turned off by government,
more turned off by the media,

00:44:58.829 --> 00:44:59.797 align:middle line:90%
or more turned off

00:44:59.797 --> 00:45:01.832 align:middle line:84%
by manipulation from
either of them.

00:45:01.832 --> 00:45:03.968 align:middle line:84%
So what we're having here
is we're having this rise,

00:45:03.968 --> 00:45:08.572 align:middle line:84%
Uranus and Aries squaring off
against Pluto and Capricorn.

00:45:08.572 --> 00:45:09.840 align:middle line:90%
So we've just taken a journey

00:45:09.840 --> 00:45:12.076 align:middle line:84%
through the 11th
house very quick.

00:45:12.076 --> 00:45:16.714 align:middle line:84%
And we've explored the
symbolic, the astrological,

00:45:16.714 --> 00:45:19.850 align:middle line:84%
and the meta nature of the death
of John F. Kennedy and the split

00:45:19.850 --> 00:45:21.252 align:middle line:90%
of the Aquarian timeline.

00:45:21.252 --> 00:45:22.787 align:middle line:84%
So I want to thank you
for joining me here

00:45:22.787 --> 00:45:25.489 align:middle line:84%
at the Spider House Cafe
and staking the journey

00:45:25.489 --> 00:45:27.958 align:middle line:90%
through the 11th house.

00:45:27.958 --> 00:45:29.093 align:middle line:90%
I'm Robert Phoenix.

00:45:29.093 --> 00:45:31.362 align:middle line:90%
Until next time.

00:45:32.429 --> 00:45:41.472 align:middle line:90%
