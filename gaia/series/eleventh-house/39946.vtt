00:00:22.423 --> 00:00:23.691 align:middle line:90%
>> Hello again.

00:00:23.691 --> 00:00:26.861 align:middle line:84%
Welcome to "The Eleventh
House" with Robert Phoenix.

00:00:26.861 --> 00:00:29.063 align:middle line:84%
I am Robert Phoenix
and today we're going

00:00:29.063 --> 00:00:30.564 align:middle line:90%
to talk about Aquarius.

00:00:30.564 --> 00:00:35.970 align:middle line:84%
It's a very interesting sign
and it's a sign that has a lot

00:00:35.970 --> 00:00:40.875 align:middle line:84%
of personal investment
for me in a lot of ways.

00:00:40.875 --> 00:00:43.878 align:middle line:84%
Why? Because, well you're
watching "The Eleventh House"

00:00:43.878 --> 00:00:46.480 align:middle line:84%
and "The Eleventh House" is
representative of Aquarius

00:00:46.480 --> 00:00:49.350 align:middle line:84%
and I have four planets
in the eleventh house.

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:53.120 align:middle line:84%
I have moon and Mercury and
Venus all in Libra conjunct

00:00:53.120 --> 00:00:56.023 align:middle line:84%
in "The Eleventh House" and
then I have Neptune, you know,

00:00:56.023 --> 00:00:57.858 align:middle line:84%
trying to sneak out of
"The Eleventh House"

00:00:57.858 --> 00:01:02.163 align:middle line:84%
into the twelfth, so I have
a strong relationship with

00:01:02.163 --> 00:01:04.331 align:middle line:84%
"The Eleventh House"
and strong relationship

00:01:04.331 --> 00:01:06.867 align:middle line:84%
with Aquarius as
a result of this.

00:01:06.867 --> 00:01:10.971 align:middle line:84%
And I've been trying to find
a kind of a balanced view

00:01:10.971 --> 00:01:16.043 align:middle line:84%
of Aquarius over the last few
months because in my early days

00:01:16.043 --> 00:01:19.346 align:middle line:84%
as an astrologer, I really
championed the sign of Aquarius.

00:01:19.346 --> 00:01:23.450 align:middle line:84%
I really felt like this was the
kind of the apex of humanity

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:25.286 align:middle line:90%
and this is where we're headed

00:01:25.286 --> 00:01:26.620 align:middle line:84%
and we are eventually
headed there.

00:01:26.620 --> 00:01:30.357 align:middle line:84%
Pluto will be in Aquarius
after it moves out of the sign

00:01:30.357 --> 00:01:32.459 align:middle line:84%
of Capricorn, so we're
going to experience

00:01:32.459 --> 00:01:34.495 align:middle line:84%
that together for
better or worse.

00:01:34.495 --> 00:01:37.397 align:middle line:84%
But I really felt like
Aquarius was the apex.

00:01:37.397 --> 00:01:41.402 align:middle line:84%
It was the sweet spot of where
we could all come together

00:01:41.402 --> 00:01:45.506 align:middle line:84%
and realize our individual
divinity with one another

00:01:45.506 --> 00:01:51.010 align:middle line:84%
and the entire planet and
have a really omni-dimensional

00:01:51.010 --> 00:01:53.180 align:middle line:84%
and omni-directional
relationship

00:01:53.180 --> 00:01:54.581 align:middle line:90%
with all of creation.

00:01:54.581 --> 00:01:58.085 align:middle line:84%
But over time, I've
spent looking at Aquarius

00:01:58.085 --> 00:02:02.189 align:middle line:84%
as it relates to periods in
history and even individuals

00:02:02.189 --> 00:02:06.026 align:middle line:84%
and I've discovered a very dark
side of Aquarius, a very cold

00:02:06.026 --> 00:02:09.697 align:middle line:84%
and manipulative side of
Aquarius and, in fact,

00:02:09.697 --> 00:02:12.166 align:middle line:84%
it relates back to the
very first show I did here

00:02:12.166 --> 00:02:16.570 align:middle line:84%
on Gaiam TV in the JFK
timeline, which is the alternate

00:02:16.570 --> 00:02:18.706 align:middle line:84%
or the synthetic
version of Aquarius

00:02:18.706 --> 00:02:21.675 align:middle line:84%
and I thought we should get in
to that a little bit more today

00:02:21.675 --> 00:02:25.145 align:middle line:84%
and try to discover
what is pushing

00:02:25.145 --> 00:02:30.784 align:middle line:84%
or driving this cosmological
force of the Aquarian Age

00:02:30.784 --> 00:02:34.021 align:middle line:84%
and perhaps the false
Aquarian Age in our lives

00:02:34.021 --> 00:02:35.356 align:middle line:90%
and if we might be able

00:02:35.356 --> 00:02:38.726 align:middle line:84%
to rediscover something
much more authentic

00:02:38.726 --> 00:02:41.161 align:middle line:84%
and sovereign inside
of ourselves

00:02:41.161 --> 00:02:43.663 align:middle line:84%
so that we're actually
embodying the Aquarian Age

00:02:43.663 --> 00:02:46.934 align:middle line:84%
without its memes
or its programs

00:02:46.934 --> 00:02:52.538 align:middle line:84%
or its manipulation driving us
to operate and assemble in a way

00:02:52.538 --> 00:02:54.275 align:middle line:90%
that a particular type

00:02:54.275 --> 00:02:57.378 align:middle line:84%
of Aquarian consciousness
would lead us

00:02:57.378 --> 00:03:00.147 align:middle line:90%
and like us to cohere to.

00:03:00.147 --> 00:03:01.282 align:middle line:90%
So, let's get in to this.

00:03:01.282 --> 00:03:03.250 align:middle line:90%
Let's go to the first slide.

00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:06.520 align:middle line:84%
So, Aquarius equals
revolutionary times.

00:03:06.520 --> 00:03:09.690 align:middle line:84%
We're going to look at three
separate periods, actually four,

00:03:09.690 --> 00:03:12.760 align:middle line:84%
where Aquarius plays a
very large role in history.

00:03:12.760 --> 00:03:16.497 align:middle line:84%
We're going to try to get some
traction here to understand

00:03:16.497 --> 00:03:20.567 align:middle line:84%
when things change and
change at a very deep level,

00:03:20.567 --> 00:03:25.673 align:middle line:84%
there's always, almost always
this kind of Aquarian force

00:03:25.673 --> 00:03:27.808 align:middle line:84%
in the shadows and
in the backgrounds.

00:03:27.808 --> 00:03:28.776 align:middle line:90%
So, we're going to try

00:03:28.776 --> 00:03:30.477 align:middle line:84%
to determine the
source of rebellion.

00:03:30.477 --> 00:03:33.781 align:middle line:84%
We're going to look
at eras in revolt.

00:03:33.781 --> 00:03:36.083 align:middle line:84%
We'll spend some time
with radical personae,

00:03:36.083 --> 00:03:40.988 align:middle line:84%
people that embody the spirit
of Aquarius, both positively

00:03:40.988 --> 00:03:47.494 align:middle line:84%
and negatively, and how they
impact these eras in revolt.

00:03:47.494 --> 00:03:51.098 align:middle line:84%
We're also going to get in
to Darwinism to transhumanism

00:03:51.098 --> 00:03:54.501 align:middle line:84%
and there is a very strong
link between the two of them

00:03:54.501 --> 00:03:58.238 align:middle line:84%
and then reshaping the
body/mind consciousness.

00:03:58.238 --> 00:03:59.540 align:middle line:90%
Whether you like it or not,

00:03:59.540 --> 00:04:04.311 align:middle line:84%
we are moving towards
an Aquarian society

00:04:04.311 --> 00:04:07.781 align:middle line:84%
and an Aquarian output
of our human experience

00:04:07.781 --> 00:04:12.853 align:middle line:84%
and there's some
darkness that is related

00:04:12.853 --> 00:04:14.188 align:middle line:90%
to that and linked to that.

00:04:14.188 --> 00:04:16.824 align:middle line:84%
We're going to get in to that
later on in this episode.

00:04:16.824 --> 00:04:18.525 align:middle line:90%
So, let's start right here.

00:04:18.525 --> 00:04:24.331 align:middle line:84%
This is Thomas Moore and Thomas
Moore is known for standing

00:04:24.331 --> 00:04:29.803 align:middle line:84%
up against King Henry VIII
and Henry VIII was the guy

00:04:29.803 --> 00:04:34.341 align:middle line:84%
that had all the wives who
couldn't bear him a son

00:04:34.341 --> 00:04:39.513 align:middle line:84%
and he was, Henry VIII was
catholic, as was most of Europe

00:04:39.513 --> 00:04:42.583 align:middle line:84%
at that time, and Henry
VIII was getting wind

00:04:42.583 --> 00:04:46.387 align:middle line:84%
of the catholic reformation
through Martin Luther

00:04:46.387 --> 00:04:47.988 align:middle line:84%
and he was really
just interested

00:04:47.988 --> 00:04:49.823 align:middle line:90%
in the catholic reformation,

00:04:49.823 --> 00:04:52.493 align:middle line:84%
which would become
the Protestant church

00:04:52.493 --> 00:04:55.829 align:middle line:84%
because with Martin Luther,
he could get a divorce,

00:04:55.829 --> 00:04:59.533 align:middle line:84%
he could find a new wife, and
he could have a male child.

00:04:59.533 --> 00:05:05.939 align:middle line:84%
Now, he wanted Thomas Moore
to sanctify Martin Luther

00:05:05.939 --> 00:05:08.942 align:middle line:84%
and allow him to
get this divorce

00:05:08.942 --> 00:05:11.011 align:middle line:90%
and Thomas Moore would not.

00:05:11.011 --> 00:05:13.080 align:middle line:90%
Thomas Moore stuck to his guns.

00:05:13.080 --> 00:05:16.383 align:middle line:84%
He wouldn't let Henry
VIII push him around.

00:05:16.383 --> 00:05:17.584 align:middle line:90%
He spent time in prison.

00:05:17.584 --> 00:05:22.489 align:middle line:84%
He eventually was, he
was killed by Henry VIII.

00:05:22.489 --> 00:05:23.924 align:middle line:90%
He lost his head.

00:05:23.924 --> 00:05:25.692 align:middle line:90%
And he was an Aquarius.

00:05:25.692 --> 00:05:29.296 align:middle line:84%
He was born on February
7th and one of the things

00:05:29.296 --> 00:05:32.633 align:middle line:84%
that Aquarians are is
that they are fixed.

00:05:32.633 --> 00:05:33.901 align:middle line:90%
They have a fixed temperament.

00:05:33.901 --> 00:05:37.438 align:middle line:84%
Aquarius, Scorpio, Leo,
Taurus' are all fixed signs.

00:05:37.438 --> 00:05:40.374 align:middle line:84%
So when you get involved
with an Aquarius person,

00:05:40.374 --> 00:05:42.309 align:middle line:84%
you'll find that
they're very open.

00:05:42.309 --> 00:05:43.644 align:middle line:90%
They're very democratic.

00:05:43.644 --> 00:05:45.579 align:middle line:90%
They can be very progressive.

00:05:45.579 --> 00:05:50.651 align:middle line:84%
They can be high minded but
they have certain ideological

00:05:50.651 --> 00:05:53.687 align:middle line:84%
parameters that they
just won't move on

00:05:53.687 --> 00:05:58.158 align:middle line:84%
and the more you push them, the
more intractable they become.

00:05:58.158 --> 00:06:03.363 align:middle line:84%
And even though Aquarius seems
to be at times really open ended

00:06:03.363 --> 00:06:06.767 align:middle line:84%
in terms of its astrological
architecture,

00:06:06.767 --> 00:06:10.637 align:middle line:84%
sometimes it can be the most
ideologically driven sign.

00:06:10.637 --> 00:06:14.208 align:middle line:84%
So, Moore was rooted
in his ideology.

00:06:14.208 --> 00:06:17.411 align:middle line:84%
He was not going to let Henry
VIII get out of his contract

00:06:17.411 --> 00:06:20.314 align:middle line:84%
of marriage, which would be a
violation between Henry VIII

00:06:20.314 --> 00:06:22.449 align:middle line:84%
and the Catholic
Church, and thus God.

00:06:22.449 --> 00:06:26.620 align:middle line:84%
But in addition to
his staunch refusal

00:06:26.620 --> 00:06:31.959 align:middle line:84%
to grant Henry VIII a divorce,
he wrote a book called "Utopia"

00:06:31.959 --> 00:06:35.996 align:middle line:90%
and this is a perfect example

00:06:35.996 --> 00:06:39.466 align:middle line:84%
of somebody's personal work
matching up with their sign.

00:06:39.466 --> 00:06:43.270 align:middle line:84%
And "Utopia" was a
"mythical" country

00:06:43.270 --> 00:06:46.206 align:middle line:84%
that was an island off
the coast of Brazil,

00:06:46.206 --> 00:06:49.443 align:middle line:90%
where Moore creates the society

00:06:49.443 --> 00:06:53.514 align:middle line:84%
that has all these interesting
rules and regulations

00:06:53.514 --> 00:06:57.985 align:middle line:84%
to pretty much create an
egalitarian experience although,

00:06:57.985 --> 00:07:01.488 align:middle line:84%
unfortunately, his
utopia did include slaves,

00:07:01.488 --> 00:07:04.224 align:middle line:84%
which probably much
of a utopia for them.

00:07:04.224 --> 00:07:07.027 align:middle line:84%
But one of the other parts
that was pretty interesting

00:07:07.027 --> 00:07:11.598 align:middle line:84%
with his version of utopia
was that he had it close

00:07:11.598 --> 00:07:13.267 align:middle line:84%
to the mainland, which
was Brazil, right?

00:07:13.267 --> 00:07:14.401 align:middle line:90%
I mean, I'm not even sure

00:07:14.401 --> 00:07:15.402 align:middle line:84%
if there was an island
off the coast of Brazil.

00:07:15.402 --> 00:07:17.504 align:middle line:84%
I think it was all
his imagination

00:07:17.504 --> 00:07:21.942 align:middle line:84%
but when the population got
too larger on the island,

00:07:21.942 --> 00:07:23.210 align:middle line:90%
people would leave the island

00:07:23.210 --> 00:07:26.213 align:middle line:84%
so they could maintain a
manageable level of population.

00:07:26.213 --> 00:07:29.283 align:middle line:84%
But it all starts here
with Moore utopia.

00:07:29.283 --> 00:07:32.786 align:middle line:84%
I supposed we could go back
to Plato and we could go back

00:07:32.786 --> 00:07:34.087 align:middle line:90%
to Atlantis, which is really

00:07:34.087 --> 00:07:36.690 align:middle line:84%
where I think the Aquarian
Age starts, and we're living

00:07:36.690 --> 00:07:38.625 align:middle line:90%
out the incarnation

00:07:38.625 --> 00:07:42.029 align:middle line:84%
of the Atlantean experience
via this Aquarian Age

00:07:42.029 --> 00:07:45.866 align:middle line:84%
but in western society, western
culture, western tradition,

00:07:45.866 --> 00:07:48.902 align:middle line:84%
the whole notion of
Aquarius starts with "Utopia"

00:07:48.902 --> 00:07:52.906 align:middle line:90%
and Aquarian, Thomas Moore.

00:07:52.906 --> 00:07:55.342 align:middle line:84%
Now, the next few
slides here are going

00:07:55.342 --> 00:07:57.945 align:middle line:90%
to be anything but utopian.

00:07:57.945 --> 00:07:59.947 align:middle line:90%
These are depictions

00:07:59.947 --> 00:08:03.383 align:middle line:84%
of revolutionary
periods in history.

00:08:03.383 --> 00:08:05.419 align:middle line:84%
This is from the
civil rights era

00:08:05.419 --> 00:08:08.789 align:middle line:84%
in the 20th century
United States, obviously,

00:08:08.789 --> 00:08:14.861 align:middle line:84%
and the reason I brought this
up is because in 1962, 1963,

00:08:14.861 --> 00:08:16.830 align:middle line:84%
Saturn was in the
sign of Aquarius

00:08:16.830 --> 00:08:22.336 align:middle line:84%
and if you watched my first
episode on Gaiam TV about JFK,

00:08:22.336 --> 00:08:26.406 align:middle line:84%
you'll remember that I talk
about the position of Saturn

00:08:26.406 --> 00:08:29.943 align:middle line:84%
on the day that John F.
Kennedy, excuse me, was killed.

00:08:29.943 --> 00:08:36.183 align:middle line:84%
Saturn and Aquarius was right
on the ascendant and to me

00:08:36.183 --> 00:08:39.820 align:middle line:84%
that is the stamp in
time for the beginning

00:08:39.820 --> 00:08:41.555 align:middle line:84%
of what I would call
the false Aquarian Age

00:08:41.555 --> 00:08:43.056 align:middle line:90%
in the 20th century.

00:08:43.056 --> 00:08:45.859 align:middle line:84%
Now this is all happening
at that time,

00:08:45.859 --> 00:08:47.794 align:middle line:90%
when Saturn is in Aquarius.

00:08:47.794 --> 00:08:53.667 align:middle line:84%
We see this sort of roiling
kind of undercurrent of equality

00:08:53.667 --> 00:08:57.270 align:middle line:84%
in the United States trying
to bubble up to the surface

00:08:57.270 --> 00:08:59.773 align:middle line:84%
and some of it is
really legitimate.

00:08:59.773 --> 00:09:03.810 align:middle line:84%
Like, you know, we can't even
imagine right now what it was

00:09:03.810 --> 00:09:05.679 align:middle line:84%
like in the south
during the 1960s,

00:09:05.679 --> 00:09:07.681 align:middle line:84%
where you would have two
separate water fountains

00:09:07.681 --> 00:09:09.316 align:middle line:84%
for people to drink
water out of.

00:09:09.316 --> 00:09:12.319 align:middle line:84%
So, there are legitimate
grievances, social grievances

00:09:12.319 --> 00:09:15.789 align:middle line:84%
that need to be addressed during
Saturn and Capricorn, I'm sorry,

00:09:15.789 --> 00:09:18.358 align:middle line:84%
Saturn and Aquarius, and then
there's a whole other arc

00:09:18.358 --> 00:09:21.962 align:middle line:84%
which are sort of artificially
inseminated into the mix.

00:09:21.962 --> 00:09:24.197 align:middle line:84%
Okay, let's go to
the next slide.

00:09:24.197 --> 00:09:26.166 align:middle line:84%
Okay, this is the
French Revolution

00:09:26.166 --> 00:09:28.635 align:middle line:84%
and there are actually
two French Revolutions.

00:09:28.635 --> 00:09:32.406 align:middle line:84%
There's one, and they're
both quite important,

00:09:32.406 --> 00:09:35.575 align:middle line:90%
between 1787 and 1799.

00:09:35.575 --> 00:09:37.411 align:middle line:84%
This is the one that
Lafayette was involved in

00:09:37.411 --> 00:09:42.482 align:middle line:84%
and that was right on the heels
of the American Revolution

00:09:42.482 --> 00:09:44.584 align:middle line:84%
and Lafayette tried to
bring a lot of the ideals.

00:09:44.584 --> 00:09:49.189 align:middle line:84%
Lafayette, by the way, had told
Washington to free the slaves

00:09:49.189 --> 00:09:50.991 align:middle line:84%
and Washington didn't
listen to him.

00:09:50.991 --> 00:09:52.626 align:middle line:90%
Bad move, George.

00:09:52.626 --> 00:09:57.030 align:middle line:84%
But Lafayette was so concerned
about this whole notion

00:09:57.030 --> 00:10:01.401 align:middle line:84%
of slave labor that he
convinced France to let go

00:10:01.401 --> 00:10:04.638 align:middle line:84%
of slavery especially in their
colony, the new world in Guiana,

00:10:04.638 --> 00:10:09.743 align:middle line:84%
so Lafayette actually had a
pretty humanitarian impact both

00:10:09.743 --> 00:10:11.712 align:middle line:84%
here in North America
and at home.

00:10:11.712 --> 00:10:12.979 align:middle line:90%
There's the French Revolution.

00:10:12.979 --> 00:10:17.918 align:middle line:84%
Saturn and Pluto were in
Aquarius during the time

00:10:17.918 --> 00:10:20.887 align:middle line:84%
in the French Revolution or
this manifestation of it.

00:10:20.887 --> 00:10:24.391 align:middle line:84%
There's another iteration of
the French Revolution in 1848

00:10:24.391 --> 00:10:28.862 align:middle line:84%
and Saturn, I'm sorry, Neptune
was in Aquarius at 29 degrees,

00:10:28.862 --> 00:10:32.265 align:middle line:84%
the anaretic degree, which
is an echo going back

00:10:32.265 --> 00:10:35.302 align:middle line:84%
to the earlier French
Revolution, where Pluto was

00:10:35.302 --> 00:10:38.705 align:middle line:84%
in Aquarius and Saturn
was in Aquarius as well.

00:10:38.705 --> 00:10:42.476 align:middle line:84%
So, let's go to the next slide
and we're going to check out.

00:10:42.476 --> 00:10:43.877 align:middle line:90%
Let me see here.

00:10:43.877 --> 00:10:47.347 align:middle line:90%
The Bolshevik Revolution.

00:10:47.347 --> 00:10:53.854 align:middle line:84%
It's the biggie and this
is where this whole spirit,

00:10:53.854 --> 00:10:57.891 align:middle line:84%
this whole notion of the
kind of the anti-Aquarius

00:10:57.891 --> 00:11:02.129 align:middle line:84%
or the dark Aquarian model
really comes in to play

00:11:02.129 --> 00:11:07.467 align:middle line:84%
and this is between
1917 and 1919.

00:11:07.467 --> 00:11:12.172 align:middle line:84%
Mars and Uranus were both
in Aquarius at that time

00:11:12.172 --> 00:11:14.975 align:middle line:84%
and this is where
the whole notion.

00:11:14.975 --> 00:11:16.943 align:middle line:84%
When we think of revolution,
we don't really think

00:11:16.943 --> 00:11:20.080 align:middle line:84%
of the French Revolution so
much unless you're watching

00:11:20.080 --> 00:11:21.848 align:middle line:90%
"Les Miserables" at the theatre.

00:11:21.848 --> 00:11:24.618 align:middle line:84%
We think of this, we think
of this as the mother

00:11:24.618 --> 00:11:27.454 align:middle line:84%
of all revolutions
and it happens

00:11:27.454 --> 00:11:29.790 align:middle line:90%
under the watch of Aquarius.

00:11:29.790 --> 00:11:32.826 align:middle line:84%
Uranus and Aquarius,
Mars and Aquarius,

00:11:32.826 --> 00:11:35.295 align:middle line:90%
and the Bolshevik Revolution,

00:11:35.295 --> 00:11:37.063 align:middle line:84%
in my estimation,
was a bill of goods.

00:11:37.063 --> 00:11:39.833 align:middle line:84%
I mean, these people
were basically told

00:11:39.833 --> 00:11:42.602 align:middle line:84%
that they were going to have
equal say and they were going

00:11:42.602 --> 00:11:46.406 align:middle line:84%
to have equal partnership in all
the resources and all the land

00:11:46.406 --> 00:11:48.875 align:middle line:84%
and really it was
just a con job.

00:11:48.875 --> 00:11:50.243 align:middle line:90%
Really, that's what it was.

00:11:50.243 --> 00:11:55.682 align:middle line:84%
And they used the fervor and
they used the energy of Aquarius

00:11:55.682 --> 00:12:01.388 align:middle line:84%
to push this across the line
and as we saw in the 60s,

00:12:01.388 --> 00:12:06.092 align:middle line:84%
when we seen Saturn in Aquarius,
we see some of the same kinds

00:12:06.092 --> 00:12:09.095 align:middle line:90%
of echoes and reverberations

00:12:09.095 --> 00:12:11.364 align:middle line:84%
that we felt during the
Bolshevik Revolution.

00:12:11.364 --> 00:12:13.466 align:middle line:84%
We'll get in to that a
little bit more as we move

00:12:13.466 --> 00:12:15.702 align:middle line:90%
through the slide presentation.

00:12:16.837 --> 00:12:19.506 align:middle line:84%
Here's Abraham Lincoln,
who's a famous Aquarian

00:12:19.506 --> 00:12:20.774 align:middle line:90%
and what did he do?

00:12:20.774 --> 00:12:25.912 align:middle line:84%
Well, of course, he emancipated
the slaves in the south

00:12:25.912 --> 00:12:28.014 align:middle line:90%
but it was a revolutionary act.

00:12:28.014 --> 00:12:30.517 align:middle line:84%
I mean, he decided that he was
going to cleave the country

00:12:30.517 --> 00:12:34.554 align:middle line:84%
in two in order to make this
happen and one of the things

00:12:34.554 --> 00:12:37.791 align:middle line:84%
that a lot of people don't
know about Lincoln was

00:12:37.791 --> 00:12:44.231 align:middle line:84%
that Lincoln had decided to push
back on the banks of Europe,

00:12:44.231 --> 00:12:48.635 align:middle line:84%
right, the Rothschild-run banks,
and he decided that he was going

00:12:48.635 --> 00:12:52.539 align:middle line:84%
to create greenbacks and he
used greenbacks essentially

00:12:52.539 --> 00:12:54.107 align:middle line:90%
to fund the Civil War.

00:12:54.107 --> 00:12:56.776 align:middle line:84%
Now, the Rothschilds
and the banking families

00:12:56.776 --> 00:12:59.479 align:middle line:84%
of Europe were not that
happy with Mr. Lincoln.

00:12:59.479 --> 00:13:02.315 align:middle line:84%
They were even less
happy with the Tsar

00:13:02.315 --> 00:13:04.951 align:middle line:84%
and apparently the Tsar
had brought some ships

00:13:04.951 --> 00:13:07.954 align:middle line:84%
around to the United
States during this period

00:13:07.954 --> 00:13:11.458 align:middle line:84%
of turmoil right around the
Civil War and they made sure

00:13:11.458 --> 00:13:14.594 align:middle line:84%
that the United States was safe
from any encroaching armies

00:13:14.594 --> 00:13:16.897 align:middle line:84%
or navies coming
across the Atlantic,

00:13:16.897 --> 00:13:20.634 align:middle line:84%
so basically the Tsar
had Lincoln's back.

00:13:20.634 --> 00:13:21.968 align:middle line:90%
And what happened to Tsar?

00:13:21.968 --> 00:13:23.670 align:middle line:90%
Well, nothing good.

00:13:23.670 --> 00:13:26.606 align:middle line:84%
He was killed, murdered
family, and what do we have

00:13:26.606 --> 00:13:28.174 align:middle line:90%
with Bolshevik Revolution.

00:13:28.174 --> 00:13:30.577 align:middle line:84%
So you see how these
things kind of work together

00:13:30.577 --> 00:13:33.847 align:middle line:90%
and trigger events through time.

00:13:33.847 --> 00:13:35.248 align:middle line:90%
Here's Mr. Darwin.

00:13:35.248 --> 00:13:39.019 align:middle line:90%
He's an Aquarius and he is one

00:13:39.019 --> 00:13:42.923 align:middle line:84%
of the most important
figures of the 20th century.

00:13:42.923 --> 00:13:46.626 align:middle line:84%
Like him or not, his
ideas of evolution,

00:13:46.626 --> 00:13:52.832 align:middle line:84%
social evolution have been
applied and to, you know,

00:13:52.832 --> 00:13:55.435 align:middle line:90%
in my estimation a poor extent.

00:13:55.435 --> 00:14:01.775 align:middle line:84%
We've taken Darwin's ideas
and we've created kind

00:14:01.775 --> 00:14:06.112 align:middle line:84%
of a sociopathic version of
only the strong will survive.

00:14:06.112 --> 00:14:09.516 align:middle line:84%
Right? Survival of the
fittest, social Darwinism,

00:14:09.516 --> 00:14:11.418 align:middle line:90%
and that's the psychological

00:14:11.418 --> 00:14:15.522 align:middle line:84%
or the psychoemotional
effect of Darwin's theories.

00:14:15.522 --> 00:14:18.692 align:middle line:84%
Of course, there's the physical
effect of Darwin's theories,

00:14:18.692 --> 00:14:21.928 align:middle line:84%
which is the embodiment
of the perfect species.

00:14:21.928 --> 00:14:24.931 align:middle line:84%
What we're talking about here
is we're talking about eugenics

00:14:24.931 --> 00:14:28.468 align:middle line:84%
and eugenics was a
really popular philosophy

00:14:28.468 --> 00:14:30.036 align:middle line:90%
in science right around the turn

00:14:30.036 --> 00:14:33.506 align:middle line:84%
of the century even
up through the 1920s.

00:14:33.506 --> 00:14:37.711 align:middle line:84%
So this whole notion of
breeding people based

00:14:37.711 --> 00:14:41.448 align:middle line:84%
on either their racial purity
or their genetic purity comes

00:14:41.448 --> 00:14:45.819 align:middle line:84%
through Darwin and as we move
through this, we're going to see

00:14:45.819 --> 00:14:51.091 align:middle line:84%
that the extension of eugenics
and Darwinism is transhumanism

00:14:51.091 --> 00:14:54.961 align:middle line:84%
because the human body
is imperfect; however,

00:14:54.961 --> 00:14:59.132 align:middle line:84%
theoretically, if we can
transfuse synthetic biology

00:14:59.132 --> 00:15:01.868 align:middle line:84%
and artificial intelligence
as the human experience,

00:15:01.868 --> 00:15:03.970 align:middle line:84%
well we can make up for
all those imperfect spots

00:15:03.970 --> 00:15:06.673 align:middle line:90%
in our nature, theoretically.

00:15:06.673 --> 00:15:12.879 align:middle line:84%
Here we have FDR, another
Aquarius, and FDR presided

00:15:12.879 --> 00:15:16.249 align:middle line:90%
over the new deal, which was

00:15:16.249 --> 00:15:20.453 align:middle line:84%
in some ways a minor
revolution in this country.

00:15:20.453 --> 00:15:28.962 align:middle line:84%
It was the largest infusion of
government and the developments

00:15:28.962 --> 00:15:31.197 align:middle line:84%
of the works project
administration

00:15:31.197 --> 00:15:34.667 align:middle line:84%
and the implementation
of it resembles kind

00:15:34.667 --> 00:15:36.903 align:middle line:90%
of a socialist work program.

00:15:36.903 --> 00:15:39.472 align:middle line:84%
Of course, this is all
happening due to the fact

00:15:39.472 --> 00:15:42.409 align:middle line:84%
that the United States was
wiped out or the economy

00:15:42.409 --> 00:15:45.311 align:middle line:84%
of the United States was wiped
out during the depression,

00:15:45.311 --> 00:15:48.915 align:middle line:84%
so FDR comes in and decides
to put people to work.

00:15:48.915 --> 00:15:51.451 align:middle line:84%
During that time, there were
a lot of people that were

00:15:51.451 --> 00:15:53.686 align:middle line:84%
against this man
and they believed

00:15:53.686 --> 00:15:56.756 align:middle line:84%
that he was a dyed-in-the-wool
socialist,

00:15:56.756 --> 00:15:58.391 align:middle line:84%
three-term dyed-in-the-wool
socialist.

00:15:58.391 --> 00:15:59.959 align:middle line:84%
He had three different
vice presidents

00:15:59.959 --> 00:16:02.195 align:middle line:90%
by the way, very interesting.

00:16:02.195 --> 00:16:06.199 align:middle line:84%
But he embodies again this
Aquarian spirit of the group

00:16:06.199 --> 00:16:10.670 align:middle line:84%
or the collective and reforming
existing structures whether you

00:16:10.670 --> 00:16:11.504 align:middle line:90%
like it or not.

00:16:11.504 --> 00:16:13.173 align:middle line:90%
Okay, let's go to the next one.

00:16:13.173 --> 00:16:16.342 align:middle line:84%
Ah yes, speaking of reform,
this is Saul Alinsky.

00:16:16.342 --> 00:16:18.111 align:middle line:90%
Some of you may be aware of him.

00:16:18.111 --> 00:16:21.414 align:middle line:84%
He is the political and
spiritual inspiration

00:16:21.414 --> 00:16:24.217 align:middle line:84%
for our current president,
Barack Hussein Obama.

00:16:24.217 --> 00:16:26.419 align:middle line:84%
Saul Alinsky comes
out of Chicago.

00:16:26.419 --> 00:16:28.388 align:middle line:90%
He's an interesting character.

00:16:28.388 --> 00:16:33.126 align:middle line:84%
He dedicated "Rules for
Radicals to Lucifer.

00:16:33.126 --> 00:16:35.128 align:middle line:90%
He's an Aquarian.

00:16:35.128 --> 00:16:37.697 align:middle line:84%
Are you starting to kind of get
the picture here a little bit.

00:16:37.697 --> 00:16:42.569 align:middle line:84%
Saul Alinsky was a mastermind
around community organizing,

00:16:42.569 --> 00:16:47.273 align:middle line:84%
again a very Aquarian
activity, and he learned a lot

00:16:47.273 --> 00:16:51.144 align:middle line:84%
of his strategies by
hanging out with Al Capone.

00:16:51.144 --> 00:16:53.880 align:middle line:84%
Saul Alinsky studied
criminal justice in Chicago

00:16:53.880 --> 00:16:57.317 align:middle line:84%
and knew Capone from his days in
Chicago, so he was able to probe

00:16:57.317 --> 00:17:00.753 align:middle line:84%
and understand the psychopathic
mind and try to figure

00:17:00.753 --> 00:17:02.422 align:middle line:90%
out what made people tick.

00:17:02.422 --> 00:17:06.259 align:middle line:84%
Saul Alinsky was very into
understanding where the weakness

00:17:06.259 --> 00:17:10.296 align:middle line:84%
and the flaws in the human
psyche resided and if you read

00:17:10.296 --> 00:17:13.099 align:middle line:90%
"Rules for Radicals," you'll see

00:17:13.099 --> 00:17:16.970 align:middle line:84%
that those weaknesses are
exploited throughout that book.

00:17:16.970 --> 00:17:20.907 align:middle line:84%
It's kind of a key strategy in
terms of community organizing

00:17:20.907 --> 00:17:23.475 align:middle line:84%
but I wanted to bring him
up here because again,

00:17:23.475 --> 00:17:28.581 align:middle line:84%
he's an embodiment of
this Aquarian kind of,

00:17:28.581 --> 00:17:33.319 align:middle line:84%
I would say negative urge
to transform and to rebel,

00:17:33.319 --> 00:17:35.555 align:middle line:84%
and the thing about Alinsky,
which is interesting,

00:17:35.555 --> 00:17:40.827 align:middle line:84%
one of his rules for radicals
was it doesn't matter what the

00:17:40.827 --> 00:17:43.229 align:middle line:90%
issue is, just find an issue.

00:17:43.229 --> 00:17:45.165 align:middle line:84%
I mean, this is kind
of the embodiment

00:17:45.165 --> 00:17:46.599 align:middle line:90%
of the shadow of Aquarius.

00:17:46.599 --> 00:17:49.102 align:middle line:84%
Just find the issue
and work the issue,

00:17:49.102 --> 00:17:51.571 align:middle line:90%
freeze the opposition, polarize.

00:17:51.571 --> 00:17:54.741 align:middle line:84%
These are all very, very
important mechanisms

00:17:54.741 --> 00:17:58.311 align:middle line:84%
when it comes to enacting
the rules for radicals

00:17:58.311 --> 00:18:00.980 align:middle line:84%
and the techniques for
successful community organizing.

00:18:00.980 --> 00:18:03.950 align:middle line:84%
I mean, we can even see today
what's happening in Washington

00:18:03.950 --> 00:18:05.685 align:middle line:84%
and what's happening
in this country.

00:18:05.685 --> 00:18:09.322 align:middle line:84%
Every now and then you'll see
something that says, you know,

00:18:09.322 --> 00:18:12.592 align:middle line:84%
this is right out of "Rules for
Radicals," divide and conquer.

00:18:12.592 --> 00:18:14.327 align:middle line:84%
You know, when the
president chimes

00:18:14.327 --> 00:18:17.263 align:middle line:84%
in behind the Trayvon Martin
thing and it becomes political,

00:18:17.263 --> 00:18:18.865 align:middle line:90%
he's polarizing people.

00:18:18.865 --> 00:18:20.200 align:middle line:90%
This is straight out of Alinsky.

00:18:20.200 --> 00:18:22.101 align:middle line:90%
Alinsky 101.

00:18:22.101 --> 00:18:23.236 align:middle line:90%
Here's Betty Friedan.

00:18:23.236 --> 00:18:26.005 align:middle line:90%
She's also an Aquarian.

00:18:26.005 --> 00:18:27.907 align:middle line:84%
She writes "The Feminine
Mystique."

00:18:27.907 --> 00:18:30.009 align:middle line:90%
It's released in 1963.

00:18:30.009 --> 00:18:33.813 align:middle line:84%
Again, Saturn is in
Aquarius and we're trying

00:18:33.813 --> 00:18:39.686 align:middle line:84%
to create this synthetic
model of equality between men

00:18:39.686 --> 00:18:45.692 align:middle line:84%
and women, and feminism is born
out of this and where are we,

00:18:45.692 --> 00:18:47.860 align:middle line:90%
63, it's almost 50 years.

00:18:47.860 --> 00:18:51.197 align:middle line:84%
In fact, it is 50 years
later and, you know,

00:18:51.197 --> 00:18:55.068 align:middle line:84%
"the struggle" is still going
on to this day and, you know,

00:18:55.068 --> 00:18:59.772 align:middle line:84%
I'm not going to chime in too
much on where we're at with it

00:18:59.772 --> 00:19:04.711 align:middle line:84%
but it seems to me again what we
have is we have this synthetic

00:19:04.711 --> 00:19:09.749 align:middle line:84%
overlay of people coming
in to the collective

00:19:09.749 --> 00:19:14.554 align:middle line:84%
or the collective theatre
and they're giving us models

00:19:14.554 --> 00:19:17.490 align:middle line:84%
of what it's like to be equal,
they're giving us models

00:19:17.490 --> 00:19:20.093 align:middle line:84%
of what it's like to have
a free and open society

00:19:20.093 --> 00:19:22.028 align:middle line:90%
or communitarian society

00:19:22.028 --> 00:19:24.497 align:middle line:84%
but these models are
coming in from the outside.

00:19:24.497 --> 00:19:28.835 align:middle line:84%
They're not coming from directly
inside of us and I think

00:19:28.835 --> 00:19:31.004 align:middle line:84%
that that's where the real
Aquarian vibration is.

00:19:31.004 --> 00:19:33.139 align:middle line:90%
Let's go to the next slide.

00:19:33.139 --> 00:19:36.075 align:middle line:84%
This is Gene Sharp and
Gene Sharp is probably one

00:19:36.075 --> 00:19:37.844 align:middle line:90%
of the most influential people

00:19:37.844 --> 00:19:40.980 align:middle line:84%
of the latter 20th
century, early 21st century.

00:19:40.980 --> 00:19:43.616 align:middle line:84%
He's 82 years old
and he's a professor

00:19:43.616 --> 00:19:45.485 align:middle line:84%
at the University
of Massachusetts.

00:19:45.485 --> 00:19:47.020 align:middle line:90%
He's been nominated, I think,

00:19:47.020 --> 00:19:51.324 align:middle line:84%
three times for noble peace
prize and he wrote a book called

00:19:51.324 --> 00:19:54.661 align:middle line:84%
"From Dictatorship to
Democracy" and Gene Sharp is

00:19:54.661 --> 00:20:00.099 align:middle line:84%
into non-violent resistance and
his book, "From Dictatorship

00:20:00.099 --> 00:20:03.903 align:middle line:84%
to Democracy" has
become the bible for all

00:20:03.903 --> 00:20:06.873 align:middle line:84%
of the color revolutions
that we've experienced

00:20:06.873 --> 00:20:09.976 align:middle line:84%
over the course of the
last three to four years.

00:20:09.976 --> 00:20:14.380 align:middle line:84%
In fact, the whole "Occupy
Wall Street" paradigm was built

00:20:14.380 --> 00:20:16.582 align:middle line:84%
on Gene Sharp's principles
and, of course,

00:20:16.582 --> 00:20:19.585 align:middle line:84%
Gene Sharp happens
to be an Aquarius.

00:20:19.585 --> 00:20:21.054 align:middle line:90%
He's still around.

00:20:21.054 --> 00:20:23.956 align:middle line:90%
Let's go to the next slide.

00:20:23.956 --> 00:20:25.291 align:middle line:90%
There she is.

00:20:25.291 --> 00:20:29.796 align:middle line:84%
Oprah Winfrey, Aquarius, driving
the Aquarian message every

00:20:29.796 --> 00:20:34.033 align:middle line:84%
single day into homes
across America.

00:20:34.033 --> 00:20:36.135 align:middle line:84%
She is the goddess
of the Aquarian Age.

00:20:36.135 --> 00:20:37.136 align:middle line:90%
She is Isis.

00:20:37.136 --> 00:20:40.073 align:middle line:90%
That's Isis right there.

00:20:40.073 --> 00:20:43.843 align:middle line:90%
Ah, this is Ray Kurzweil.

00:20:43.843 --> 00:20:47.046 align:middle line:84%
Now Ray Kurzweil is the
father of transhumanism.

00:20:47.046 --> 00:20:48.915 align:middle line:90%
Well, maybe Darwin is.

00:20:48.915 --> 00:20:52.118 align:middle line:84%
Maybe he's like the
grandson of transhumanism.

00:20:52.118 --> 00:20:55.154 align:middle line:84%
But in today's society,
he is sort of the living,

00:20:55.154 --> 00:20:59.392 align:middle line:84%
breathing iconic
representation of transhumanism.

00:20:59.392 --> 00:21:02.428 align:middle line:84%
He wrote a book called "The
Age of Spiritual Machines."

00:21:02.428 --> 00:21:05.131 align:middle line:84%
He created one of the best
synthesizers of all time,

00:21:05.131 --> 00:21:07.500 align:middle line:90%
the Kurzweil synthesizer,

00:21:07.500 --> 00:21:10.470 align:middle line:84%
and currently he's
running Google technology.

00:21:10.470 --> 00:21:12.905 align:middle line:84%
This is the man in
charge of Google.

00:21:12.905 --> 00:21:15.842 align:middle line:84%
He came up with the whole
idea, "The Singularity,"

00:21:15.842 --> 00:21:20.380 align:middle line:84%
and the singularity is this
notion that machine intelligence

00:21:20.380 --> 00:21:24.851 align:middle line:84%
or artificial intelligence
will surpass human intelligence

00:21:24.851 --> 00:21:27.020 align:middle line:84%
at one point in the
not-so-distant future.

00:21:27.020 --> 00:21:28.721 align:middle line:84%
Kurzweil says the
singularity is here.

00:21:28.721 --> 00:21:32.692 align:middle line:84%
He might be right but
he is also an Aquarius

00:21:32.692 --> 00:21:37.430 align:middle line:84%
and he's bringing this notion
that we can take technology

00:21:37.430 --> 00:21:42.168 align:middle line:84%
and infuse it into our biology
and make us more perfect

00:21:42.168 --> 00:21:45.338 align:middle line:90%
or more human or superhuman.

00:21:45.338 --> 00:21:49.842 align:middle line:84%
So, this transhumanism is
the extension of eugenics.

00:21:49.842 --> 00:21:52.979 align:middle line:84%
Eugenics transforms
itself into transhumanism.

00:21:52.979 --> 00:21:55.348 align:middle line:84%
Somewhere along the way with
transhumanism and eugenics,

00:21:55.348 --> 00:21:57.450 align:middle line:84%
we have to take a
stop in Nazi Germany,

00:21:57.450 --> 00:22:00.219 align:middle line:84%
where they create steroids,
and steroids is kind

00:22:00.219 --> 00:22:04.857 align:middle line:84%
of this first again synthetic,
this anabolic infusion

00:22:04.857 --> 00:22:07.627 align:middle line:84%
into making people
into super-people.

00:22:07.627 --> 00:22:09.796 align:middle line:84%
The whole idea of
the super-soldier,

00:22:09.796 --> 00:22:13.232 align:middle line:84%
the notion of the super-soldier
also comes out of transhumanism

00:22:13.232 --> 00:22:16.769 align:middle line:84%
as well and eugenics,
so this is Ray Kurzweil.

00:22:16.769 --> 00:22:19.005 align:middle line:84%
He's the man of the moment and
right now we're going to start

00:22:19.005 --> 00:22:22.008 align:middle line:84%
to shift the focus a
little bit and explore

00:22:22.008 --> 00:22:26.279 align:middle line:84%
where I think the Age of
Aquarius, the synthetic Age

00:22:26.279 --> 00:22:28.281 align:middle line:90%
of Aquarius is taking us.

00:22:28.281 --> 00:22:31.117 align:middle line:84%
I just wanted to bring
this up really quickly.

00:22:31.117 --> 00:22:33.219 align:middle line:90%
This is US days of rage.

00:22:33.219 --> 00:22:39.325 align:middle line:84%
This is the poster that kicked
off the "Occupy Wall Street"

00:22:39.325 --> 00:22:45.698 align:middle line:84%
in New York and the date for
that was September 17, 2011,

00:22:45.698 --> 00:22:48.434 align:middle line:84%
and the number 17 is
really interesting.

00:22:48.434 --> 00:22:51.971 align:middle line:84%
Number 17 is in the
Major Arcana Tarot.

00:22:51.971 --> 00:22:55.608 align:middle line:84%
That is the star card, which
represents the sign of Aquarius.

00:22:55.608 --> 00:22:57.477 align:middle line:84%
So, here again, we
have Aquarius showing

00:22:57.477 --> 00:23:00.880 align:middle line:84%
up even though it's September
in the month of Virgo,

00:23:00.880 --> 00:23:04.383 align:middle line:84%
September 17th and we see
again, the kind of the echoes

00:23:04.383 --> 00:23:08.654 align:middle line:84%
of the Bolshevik era and being
revived under the auspices

00:23:08.654 --> 00:23:11.824 align:middle line:84%
of the star of Aquarius
on the 17th of September.

00:23:11.824 --> 00:23:12.959 align:middle line:90%
Here's Ronald Reagan.

00:23:12.959 --> 00:23:16.162 align:middle line:84%
He's an Aquarian and he
had his own revolution.

00:23:16.162 --> 00:23:17.363 align:middle line:90%
I mean, if you think about it,

00:23:17.363 --> 00:23:20.833 align:middle line:84%
the Reaganites brought
their own brand of change

00:23:20.833 --> 00:23:25.271 align:middle line:84%
and radicalizing America at
that time and America was coming

00:23:25.271 --> 00:23:28.508 align:middle line:84%
out of the 60s and
Reagan appealed to a lot

00:23:28.508 --> 00:23:30.776 align:middle line:84%
of the Baby Boomers, say, "Hey,
you want to keep your money?

00:23:30.776 --> 00:23:32.011 align:middle line:90%
Vote for me?"

00:23:32.011 --> 00:23:34.147 align:middle line:90%
That's the revolution.

00:23:34.147 --> 00:23:37.383 align:middle line:84%
He shares his birthday
with this man, Bob Marley,

00:23:37.383 --> 00:23:41.487 align:middle line:84%
who ideally typifies the
spirit of Aquarius, "One Love."

00:23:41.487 --> 00:23:43.956 align:middle line:84%
Marley, of course,
left us way too soon

00:23:43.956 --> 00:23:45.191 align:middle line:90%
and I think he was taken out.

00:23:45.191 --> 00:23:48.528 align:middle line:84%
That's my own personal
feeling about Bob Marley.

00:23:48.528 --> 00:23:51.230 align:middle line:84%
But, Bob Marley, the Wailers,
and everything associated

00:23:51.230 --> 00:23:55.668 align:middle line:84%
with Marley was Aquarian
to the core.

00:23:55.668 --> 00:23:58.905 align:middle line:84%
And Marley was on to
the Babylon matrix.

00:23:58.905 --> 00:24:00.773 align:middle line:84%
He knew what it was
all about and he knew

00:24:00.773 --> 00:24:03.643 align:middle line:84%
that the message was love and
taking care of one another.

00:24:03.643 --> 00:24:08.281 align:middle line:84%
To me, that is really,
that is the cord that needs

00:24:08.281 --> 00:24:10.716 align:middle line:84%
to be sounded about,
about Aquarius.

00:24:10.716 --> 00:24:12.151 align:middle line:84%
So if there's anything
you're going to take away

00:24:12.151 --> 00:24:15.054 align:middle line:84%
from this little presentation
today, besides the fact

00:24:15.054 --> 00:24:18.591 align:middle line:84%
that we're about to enter the
robot age, it's that we have

00:24:18.591 --> 00:24:23.229 align:middle line:84%
to retain our humanity and
that really is the pulse.

00:24:23.229 --> 00:24:25.865 align:middle line:84%
That's the pulse of the
real Age of Aquarius.

00:24:25.865 --> 00:24:27.133 align:middle line:90%
Let's move on to the next slide.

00:24:27.133 --> 00:24:28.301 align:middle line:90%
Here we go.

00:24:28.301 --> 00:24:31.304 align:middle line:84%
Now CBS is doing something
really interesting.

00:24:31.304 --> 00:24:37.143 align:middle line:84%
They are starting to offer
up a style of programming

00:24:37.143 --> 00:24:38.511 align:middle line:90%
which is promoting the future.

00:24:38.511 --> 00:24:40.780 align:middle line:84%
They call this predictive
programming.

00:24:40.780 --> 00:24:45.251 align:middle line:84%
They're getting you ready for a
social leap or a social change

00:24:45.251 --> 00:24:49.155 align:middle line:84%
and in this show, it's, well,
you can see this on this ad,

00:24:49.155 --> 00:24:52.425 align:middle line:84%
we'll get in to this ad in a
little bit, but on this show,

00:24:52.425 --> 00:24:54.293 align:middle line:90%
this guy is not human.

00:24:54.293 --> 00:24:56.829 align:middle line:90%
He's almost human.

00:24:56.829 --> 00:24:58.264 align:middle line:90%
He's a cyborg.

00:24:58.264 --> 00:25:01.634 align:middle line:84%
He's kind of a human, sort
of, he's like a replica from

00:25:01.634 --> 00:25:04.971 align:middle line:84%
"Blade Runner" and
it's a cop buddy show

00:25:04.971 --> 00:25:07.974 align:middle line:90%
and he has the ability to emote.

00:25:07.974 --> 00:25:10.076 align:middle line:84%
He has a little switch
over here, I think,

00:25:10.076 --> 00:25:13.579 align:middle line:84%
somewhere on that side, that
this guy can flick on and off,

00:25:13.579 --> 00:25:14.981 align:middle line:90%
and he can actually emote.

00:25:14.981 --> 00:25:18.985 align:middle line:84%
He can actually have feelings or
if he needs him to be super cold

00:25:18.985 --> 00:25:21.454 align:middle line:84%
and super didactic, I guess
he could flip another switch

00:25:21.454 --> 00:25:23.122 align:middle line:90%
and turn them back on.

00:25:23.122 --> 00:25:25.391 align:middle line:84%
What's also interesting
about him is

00:25:25.391 --> 00:25:27.793 align:middle line:90%
that he's obviously mixed race,

00:25:27.793 --> 00:25:30.963 align:middle line:84%
so there's this whole
notion of fusion going on.

00:25:30.963 --> 00:25:34.033 align:middle line:90%
He's human but he's cyborg.

00:25:34.033 --> 00:25:36.035 align:middle line:90%
He's black but he's white.

00:25:36.035 --> 00:25:37.336 align:middle line:84%
You know, he works
for the police

00:25:37.336 --> 00:25:40.373 align:middle line:84%
but the strange thing too
here is that this, you know,

00:25:40.373 --> 00:25:43.743 align:middle line:84%
there's this strange, makes me
feel a little uncomfortable.

00:25:43.743 --> 00:25:46.812 align:middle line:84%
There's a strange kind
of vibe that you know,

00:25:46.812 --> 00:25:50.416 align:middle line:84%
he's almost like a slave in
some ways because, you know,

00:25:50.416 --> 00:25:55.621 align:middle line:84%
he can flip the switch on
and off and it's an odd,

00:25:55.621 --> 00:26:00.026 align:middle line:84%
sort of paring, but what they're
trying to do is they're trying

00:26:00.026 --> 00:26:04.630 align:middle line:84%
to get people used to this
notion that humans don't have

00:26:04.630 --> 00:26:07.033 align:middle line:84%
to be human anymore and
here we can see kind

00:26:07.033 --> 00:26:11.771 align:middle line:84%
of the biometric imprint of him
putting his hand upon this grid,

00:26:11.771 --> 00:26:14.273 align:middle line:84%
which is probably
identifying him at some point

00:26:14.273 --> 00:26:17.209 align:middle line:84%
or somewhere along his
journey here, so this is one

00:26:17.209 --> 00:26:19.679 align:middle line:84%
of the programs that
CBS is bringing

00:26:19.679 --> 00:26:22.748 align:middle line:84%
to our consciousness
and our awareness.

00:26:22.748 --> 00:26:23.582 align:middle line:90%
Here's another one.

00:26:23.582 --> 00:26:25.217 align:middle line:90%
This is called "Intelligence."

00:26:25.217 --> 00:26:28.454 align:middle line:84%
Again, he's human but he's
got a chip in his brain,

00:26:28.454 --> 00:26:29.889 align:middle line:90%
which makes him more than human.

00:26:29.889 --> 00:26:31.691 align:middle line:90%
It makes him really special.

00:26:31.691 --> 00:26:32.725 align:middle line:90%
It makes him superhuman.

00:26:32.725 --> 00:26:34.493 align:middle line:90%
He's got great intelligence.

00:26:34.493 --> 00:26:35.928 align:middle line:90%
So, what are we doing again?

00:26:35.928 --> 00:26:37.463 align:middle line:90%
We're starting to wrap our heads

00:26:37.463 --> 00:26:40.966 align:middle line:84%
around the transhumanist
prospect and again,

00:26:40.966 --> 00:26:43.836 align:middle line:84%
this is a manifestation
of the Age of Aquarius,

00:26:43.836 --> 00:26:47.173 align:middle line:84%
where technology and
biology come together.

00:26:47.173 --> 00:26:48.107 align:middle line:90%
It's this fusion.

00:26:48.107 --> 00:26:49.575 align:middle line:90%
It's this perfection.

00:26:49.575 --> 00:26:50.910 align:middle line:90%
It's the sense of almost

00:26:50.910 --> 00:26:56.816 align:middle line:84%
like borgian awareness that's
flooding our consciousness

00:26:56.816 --> 00:26:58.918 align:middle line:90%
or will flood our consciousness.

00:26:58.918 --> 00:26:59.719 align:middle line:90%
Here's another one.

00:26:59.719 --> 00:27:02.221 align:middle line:90%
This is not quite as overt.

00:27:02.221 --> 00:27:05.524 align:middle line:84%
This is "Person of Interest"
and the tag line here is

00:27:05.524 --> 00:27:07.259 align:middle line:90%
"You are being watched."

00:27:07.259 --> 00:27:10.429 align:middle line:84%
So, in a society
of surveillance.

00:27:10.429 --> 00:27:12.264 align:middle line:84%
Look. These look like
constellations back here.

00:27:12.264 --> 00:27:12.798 align:middle line:90%
Don't they?

00:27:12.798 --> 00:27:13.799 align:middle line:90%
Yes they do.

00:27:13.799 --> 00:27:15.501 align:middle line:84%
So there's an astrological
component

00:27:15.501 --> 00:27:16.836 align:middle line:90%
that they're working at as well.

00:27:16.836 --> 00:27:20.840 align:middle line:84%
In a society of surveillance,
which we are currently in,

00:27:20.840 --> 00:27:23.142 align:middle line:84%
not only are we being
told by Edward Snowden,

00:27:23.142 --> 00:27:25.711 align:middle line:84%
but we're being told
by CBS on "Person

00:27:25.711 --> 00:27:28.581 align:middle line:84%
of Interest" these
two guys, by the way,

00:27:28.581 --> 00:27:31.350 align:middle line:84%
their specialty is
pre-crime, mind crime,

00:27:31.350 --> 00:27:33.986 align:middle line:84%
so what they're trying to
figure out is who's going

00:27:33.986 --> 00:27:36.589 align:middle line:84%
to do something bad in the
world and they're going

00:27:36.589 --> 00:27:39.592 align:middle line:84%
to use all this technology
in order to get

00:27:39.592 --> 00:27:42.261 align:middle line:84%
to that person before
they do the bad thing

00:27:42.261 --> 00:27:43.796 align:middle line:90%
to make the world safer.

00:27:43.796 --> 00:27:48.534 align:middle line:84%
And this whole idea of
surveillance and observation,

00:27:48.534 --> 00:27:50.803 align:middle line:84%
that also comes under
the Aquarian rubric.

00:27:50.803 --> 00:27:52.972 align:middle line:90%
Right? It's the all-seeing eye.

00:27:52.972 --> 00:27:56.642 align:middle line:84%
It's the collective that's
constantly being observed

00:27:56.642 --> 00:27:58.410 align:middle line:90%
and watched.

00:28:00.012 --> 00:28:03.249 align:middle line:84%
Okay, here we have Amazon's
new offering to the world.

00:28:03.249 --> 00:28:06.852 align:middle line:90%
It is the delivery drone.

00:28:06.852 --> 00:28:12.525 align:middle line:84%
These commercials are starting
to be seen on television

00:28:12.525 --> 00:28:17.930 align:middle line:84%
and on the internet and it
sort of speaks for itself.

00:28:17.930 --> 00:28:20.466 align:middle line:84%
Right? It's like, here we
have a drone getting ready

00:28:20.466 --> 00:28:23.769 align:middle line:84%
to drop off a package
you can order online

00:28:23.769 --> 00:28:27.239 align:middle line:84%
and maybe 30 minutes after you
order it, it's at your house.

00:28:27.239 --> 00:28:30.876 align:middle line:84%
What we're seeing again is
this incursion of this kind

00:28:30.876 --> 00:28:32.745 align:middle line:90%
of Aquarian technology,

00:28:32.745 --> 00:28:35.815 align:middle line:84%
making life simple
running, making life easier.

00:28:35.815 --> 00:28:37.183 align:middle line:90%
This is what science does.

00:28:37.183 --> 00:28:41.020 align:middle line:84%
Right? All these things that
were given to us in the 1960s

00:28:41.020 --> 00:28:44.790 align:middle line:84%
at the New York World's Fair,
they're finally starting to come

00:28:44.790 --> 00:28:47.459 align:middle line:84%
to fruition, the cell phone,
being able to talk to somebody

00:28:47.459 --> 00:28:50.529 align:middle line:84%
on your computer, having a
little helicopter bring you

00:28:50.529 --> 00:28:51.864 align:middle line:90%
a pizza.

00:28:51.864 --> 00:28:55.000 align:middle line:84%
It's all happening now and
it's all for your convenience.

00:28:55.000 --> 00:28:57.503 align:middle line:84%
Right? This is all
why it's taking place.

00:28:57.503 --> 00:28:58.971 align:middle line:84%
You can have more
time doing what?

00:28:58.971 --> 00:29:01.173 align:middle line:84%
Playing with more
technology, I suppose.

00:29:01.173 --> 00:29:04.009 align:middle line:84%
But this is where it's
headed and what's happening

00:29:04.009 --> 00:29:07.780 align:middle line:84%
with this is that not only
are they getting people used

00:29:07.780 --> 00:29:10.549 align:middle line:84%
to this, this is a type of
predictive programming as well

00:29:10.549 --> 00:29:12.051 align:middle line:90%
on a commercial level.

00:29:12.051 --> 00:29:14.119 align:middle line:84%
Well, they're going to
get you used to this

00:29:14.119 --> 00:29:18.824 align:middle line:84%
on a noncommercial level for
again surveillance, security,

00:29:18.824 --> 00:29:21.360 align:middle line:84%
all those wonderful
things that we need.

00:29:21.360 --> 00:29:26.065 align:middle line:84%
These devices are going to
be floating around the sky,

00:29:26.065 --> 00:29:28.834 align:middle line:84%
of course, for our benefit and
how they're going to get us used

00:29:28.834 --> 00:29:32.104 align:middle line:84%
to it is by bringing us pizzas
or burritos right to our door.

00:29:32.104 --> 00:29:34.506 align:middle line:90%
Isn't that fun?

00:29:34.506 --> 00:29:35.574 align:middle line:90%
Okay, so here we go.

00:29:35.574 --> 00:29:37.276 align:middle line:90%
This is from USA Today,

00:29:37.276 --> 00:29:39.945 align:middle line:84%
"Undergone Drone
Economy Takes Flight."

00:29:39.945 --> 00:29:42.848 align:middle line:84%
You know, when you
talk to people who are

00:29:42.848 --> 00:29:46.385 align:middle line:84%
in to drone economy, it sounds
like they're in California

00:29:46.385 --> 00:29:49.021 align:middle line:90%
in 1849, it's a new gold rush.

00:29:49.021 --> 00:29:51.056 align:middle line:84%
I mean, these guys
are really excited

00:29:51.056 --> 00:29:53.626 align:middle line:84%
about the economic
impact of drones.

00:29:53.626 --> 00:29:57.496 align:middle line:84%
It's like the internet,
only the internet for 1996,

00:29:57.496 --> 00:30:00.332 align:middle line:84%
and it's happening right
now and it's drones

00:30:00.332 --> 00:30:03.269 align:middle line:84%
and all these things
are happening sort

00:30:03.269 --> 00:30:07.206 align:middle line:84%
of simultaneously,
the Amazon commercial,

00:30:07.206 --> 00:30:09.408 align:middle line:90%
this post on "USA Today."

00:30:09.408 --> 00:30:11.577 align:middle line:90%
In fact, it's on the headlines

00:30:11.577 --> 00:30:13.279 align:middle line:84%
of the physical paper
of "USA Today."

00:30:13.279 --> 00:30:18.584 align:middle line:84%
So get ready for
drone consciousness.

00:30:18.584 --> 00:30:21.620 align:middle line:84%
Now, some of you
might recognize this.

00:30:21.620 --> 00:30:27.059 align:middle line:84%
These are chemtrails and,
in fact, Gaiam TV has

00:30:27.059 --> 00:30:31.530 align:middle line:84%
about four DVDs or they've got
four shows that you can watch

00:30:31.530 --> 00:30:34.566 align:middle line:84%
on chemtrails, which
I highly recommend.

00:30:34.566 --> 00:30:39.438 align:middle line:84%
And let's just say for instance
that the whole idea for you

00:30:39.438 --> 00:30:43.542 align:middle line:84%
and I, right, is to
become part of this sort

00:30:43.542 --> 00:30:48.180 align:middle line:84%
of synthetic biological fusion
that whether we like it or not,

00:30:48.180 --> 00:30:49.815 align:middle line:84%
that's kind of where
we're headed.

00:30:49.815 --> 00:30:53.185 align:middle line:84%
Now, you may say to yourself,
"Well, I don't want any part

00:30:53.185 --> 00:30:55.587 align:middle line:84%
of that," you know, "I'll
say no to a chip" or you know

00:30:55.587 --> 00:30:58.057 align:middle line:84%
"I'll grow my own food
and it'll be organic food

00:30:58.057 --> 00:30:59.858 align:middle line:90%
and GMOs won't affect me."

00:30:59.858 --> 00:31:02.528 align:middle line:84%
Well, you may not
necessarily have a choice.

00:31:02.528 --> 00:31:06.865 align:middle line:84%
Now these are chemtrails
and chemtrails are filled

00:31:06.865 --> 00:31:09.635 align:middle line:84%
with all kinds of
interesting things.

00:31:09.635 --> 00:31:12.938 align:middle line:84%
The first basic fundamental
element

00:31:12.938 --> 00:31:18.444 align:middle line:84%
of chemtrails is aluminum and
iron dioxide and all kinds

00:31:18.444 --> 00:31:21.880 align:middle line:84%
of metals, which make
them electrically charged,

00:31:21.880 --> 00:31:26.652 align:middle line:84%
but they also have found things
like nanoarrays and smart dust

00:31:26.652 --> 00:31:30.489 align:middle line:84%
and moats inside of
chemtrails, things so small

00:31:30.489 --> 00:31:34.159 align:middle line:84%
that they can actually pass the
brain/blood barrier and some

00:31:34.159 --> 00:31:39.264 align:middle line:84%
of the things that people have
wound up having to experience

00:31:39.264 --> 00:31:43.035 align:middle line:84%
as a result of chemtrails
are this.

00:31:43.035 --> 00:31:47.306 align:middle line:84%
This is what looks like
a chip, which was pulled

00:31:47.306 --> 00:31:51.043 align:middle line:84%
out of a person's skin
and this, I guess,

00:31:51.043 --> 00:31:53.779 align:middle line:84%
would fall under the
Morgellons category.

00:31:53.779 --> 00:31:59.752 align:middle line:84%
This almost looks like a silicon
chip that's got some hemoglobin

00:31:59.752 --> 00:32:02.354 align:middle line:84%
or some blood plasma
associated with it.

00:32:02.354 --> 00:32:04.289 align:middle line:84%
This came out of
somebody's skin.

00:32:04.289 --> 00:32:07.993 align:middle line:84%
So there are people on the
internet, there are people,

00:32:07.993 --> 00:32:09.628 align:middle line:84%
not on the internet, they're
in the world but they talk

00:32:09.628 --> 00:32:11.030 align:middle line:90%
about it on the internet.

00:32:11.030 --> 00:32:13.766 align:middle line:84%
They share their stories on the
internet where they're pulling

00:32:13.766 --> 00:32:15.501 align:middle line:90%
like this out of their body.

00:32:15.501 --> 00:32:19.438 align:middle line:84%
So whether or not
you want to be part

00:32:19.438 --> 00:32:24.309 align:middle line:84%
of the transhumanist
Aquarian wet dream,

00:32:24.309 --> 00:32:29.114 align:middle line:84%
you may not necessarily have a
choice because all this stuff is

00:32:29.114 --> 00:32:31.450 align:middle line:90%
around smart dust, smart moats.

00:32:31.450 --> 00:32:33.519 align:middle line:84%
They're not in chemtrails,
they're a reality.

00:32:33.519 --> 00:32:36.155 align:middle line:84%
They, you know, scientists
and research groups,

00:32:36.155 --> 00:32:38.490 align:middle line:84%
they will take smart
dust and smart moats

00:32:38.490 --> 00:32:40.926 align:middle line:84%
and they'll distribute them
all over the environment

00:32:40.926 --> 00:32:46.498 align:middle line:84%
to see how rainfall or
see how humidity or wind

00:32:46.498 --> 00:32:49.168 align:middle line:84%
or whatever kind
of meteorological

00:32:49.168 --> 00:32:52.137 align:middle line:84%
or climatological changes
occur in an environment.

00:32:52.137 --> 00:32:54.440 align:middle line:84%
The smart dust or the moats
will report back to them.

00:32:54.440 --> 00:32:57.076 align:middle line:84%
So this stuff is floating
around regardless of whether

00:32:57.076 --> 00:33:00.512 align:middle line:84%
or not you believe in chemtrails
or thinking you've got one

00:33:00.512 --> 00:33:02.981 align:middle line:84%
of these little pieces
of technology floating

00:33:02.981 --> 00:33:03.849 align:middle line:90%
around in your bloodstream.

00:33:03.849 --> 00:33:05.484 align:middle line:90%
It's out there.

00:33:05.484 --> 00:33:07.019 align:middle line:90%
Okay, speaking of out there.

00:33:07.019 --> 00:33:09.488 align:middle line:90%
This is the future of policing.

00:33:09.488 --> 00:33:12.291 align:middle line:90%
This is Robocop 101.

00:33:12.291 --> 00:33:15.861 align:middle line:84%
Japan, by the way, is on
the cutting edge of robotics

00:33:15.861 --> 00:33:21.300 align:middle line:84%
and at some point in time, we're
going to see a lot more of this

00:33:21.300 --> 00:33:24.570 align:middle line:84%
than this on the streets
and one of the scary parts

00:33:24.570 --> 00:33:29.241 align:middle line:84%
about robotics as law
enforcement officers is

00:33:29.241 --> 00:33:31.343 align:middle line:84%
that they don't necessarily
have a conscious.

00:33:31.343 --> 00:33:33.979 align:middle line:84%
Right? So, they'll do pretty
much anything that you tell them

00:33:33.979 --> 00:33:37.316 align:middle line:84%
to do unless, of course, Ray
Kurzweil singularity kicks

00:33:37.316 --> 00:33:38.817 align:middle line:90%
in to develop a conscious

00:33:38.817 --> 00:33:41.186 align:middle line:84%
and maybe they revolt
again their makers.

00:33:41.186 --> 00:33:44.156 align:middle line:84%
Here's another interesting
little image from Japan.

00:33:44.156 --> 00:33:45.924 align:middle line:90%
Now, this is a real image.

00:33:45.924 --> 00:33:49.361 align:middle line:84%
This is a real robot
and it's been developed

00:33:49.361 --> 00:33:52.931 align:middle line:84%
to help the elderly get in
and out of beds; however,

00:33:52.931 --> 00:33:56.702 align:middle line:84%
they're finding that when
they've used them in rest homes,

00:33:56.702 --> 00:33:58.370 align:middle line:90%
the elderly don't like them.

00:33:58.370 --> 00:34:01.306 align:middle line:84%
They don't like being
picked up by robots.

00:34:01.306 --> 00:34:02.508 align:middle line:90%
It's a cute little robot.

00:34:02.508 --> 00:34:04.309 align:middle line:84%
Isn't it? But here we
have a younger person.

00:34:04.309 --> 00:34:08.347 align:middle line:84%
Obviously, she really enjoys
being picked up by this robot.

00:34:08.347 --> 00:34:09.981 align:middle line:84%
She's got a nice
smile on her face.

00:34:09.981 --> 00:34:12.217 align:middle line:90%
But this is the future.

00:34:12.217 --> 00:34:15.254 align:middle line:84%
This is where consciousness
is headed in some ways.

00:34:15.254 --> 00:34:17.923 align:middle line:84%
We're going to have
to deal with this

00:34:17.923 --> 00:34:20.225 align:middle line:84%
and this is part of
the Aquarian age.

00:34:20.225 --> 00:34:23.662 align:middle line:84%
This is part of welcoming
this transfusion

00:34:23.662 --> 00:34:28.233 align:middle line:84%
of artificial intelligence and
ultimately synthetic biology

00:34:28.233 --> 00:34:29.401 align:middle line:90%
and where's it all headed?

00:34:29.401 --> 00:34:30.536 align:middle line:90%
Here we go.

00:34:30.536 --> 00:34:31.737 align:middle line:90%
There he is.

00:34:31.737 --> 00:34:34.339 align:middle line:84%
Terminator, Arnold
Schwarzenegger,

00:34:34.339 --> 00:34:37.709 align:middle line:84%
and where does Arnie
get his start?

00:34:37.709 --> 00:34:39.878 align:middle line:84%
He gets his start in the
future with the development

00:34:39.878 --> 00:34:42.981 align:middle line:84%
of Skynet and, of course,
the disaster that takes place

00:34:42.981 --> 00:34:48.053 align:middle line:84%
as a result of the rise of
intelligence in machines

00:34:48.053 --> 00:34:50.856 align:middle line:84%
and I love the eye
or horrors here.

00:34:50.856 --> 00:34:52.490 align:middle line:84%
They always manage
to get that in there.

00:34:52.490 --> 00:34:54.493 align:middle line:84%
But this is where
theoretically it's all headed.

00:34:54.493 --> 00:34:56.929 align:middle line:84%
I mean, we are on
that vector right now

00:34:56.929 --> 00:35:02.801 align:middle line:84%
with the transhumanist drive
in our culture and our society

00:35:02.801 --> 00:35:06.238 align:middle line:84%
and again, this is an extension
and manifestation of Aquarius.

00:35:06.238 --> 00:35:07.639 align:middle line:90%
But, there is hope.

00:35:07.639 --> 00:35:09.007 align:middle line:90%
The hope is you.

00:35:09.007 --> 00:35:12.177 align:middle line:84%
Right. You're watching the show
right now and you're seeing

00:35:12.177 --> 00:35:14.179 align:middle line:84%
where theoretically
this could head.

00:35:14.179 --> 00:35:16.448 align:middle line:90%
What can you do?

00:35:16.448 --> 00:35:21.386 align:middle line:84%
How can you stave off this
kind of strange mutation

00:35:21.386 --> 00:35:23.755 align:middle line:84%
and almost borg-like
consciousness?

00:35:23.755 --> 00:35:27.492 align:middle line:84%
Well, the thing that you can do
is to remain human and that's

00:35:27.492 --> 00:35:29.561 align:middle line:90%
to be conscious, to be aware.

00:35:29.561 --> 00:35:31.330 align:middle line:84%
How are you treating
another individual?

00:35:31.330 --> 00:35:32.931 align:middle line:90%
Are you compassionate?

00:35:32.931 --> 00:35:34.266 align:middle line:90%
Are you forgiving?

00:35:34.266 --> 00:35:35.601 align:middle line:90%
You know, how are you eating?

00:35:35.601 --> 00:35:37.502 align:middle line:90%
How are you growing your food?

00:35:37.502 --> 00:35:40.539 align:middle line:84%
How are you interacting with
people on a day-to-day basis?

00:35:40.539 --> 00:35:42.507 align:middle line:84%
How are you staying in
touch with your humanity

00:35:42.507 --> 00:35:45.010 align:middle line:84%
because every moment
and every day counts.

00:35:45.010 --> 00:35:47.546 align:middle line:84%
And when you let it go,
when you let your guard down

00:35:47.546 --> 00:35:50.148 align:middle line:84%
and when you act like
a robot or you act

00:35:50.148 --> 00:35:53.218 align:middle line:84%
with an automated response
or you act like a machine,

00:35:53.218 --> 00:35:57.022 align:middle line:84%
what you're actually doing is
you're empowering this type

00:35:57.022 --> 00:36:01.426 align:middle line:84%
of consciousness to
grow and emerge in a way

00:36:01.426 --> 00:36:03.428 align:middle line:84%
that may not necessarily
be that entirely positive.

00:36:03.428 --> 00:36:04.496 align:middle line:90%
Now, I'm not a complete glut.

00:36:04.496 --> 00:36:06.164 align:middle line:84%
I don't want to go
back to the middle ages

00:36:06.164 --> 00:36:07.933 align:middle line:84%
and I think we could
have machines

00:36:07.933 --> 00:36:10.902 align:middle line:84%
that we can work
together with, hopefully,

00:36:10.902 --> 00:36:14.072 align:middle line:84%
but we can't lose our humanity,
we can't lose our conscience

00:36:14.072 --> 00:36:17.943 align:middle line:84%
and we can't lose our
divine faith along the way

00:36:17.943 --> 00:36:19.244 align:middle line:84%
and if we don't, we're
just going to turn

00:36:19.244 --> 00:36:20.846 align:middle line:90%
into machines ourselves.

00:36:20.846 --> 00:36:22.414 align:middle line:84%
So that's it today from
"The Eleventh House."

00:36:22.414 --> 00:36:23.548 align:middle line:90%
I'm Robert Phoenix.

00:36:23.548 --> 00:36:25.918 align:middle line:84%
Join me next time, where
we explore more strange

00:36:25.918 --> 00:36:30.589 align:middle line:84%
and mysterious anomalies in
the astrological universe.

00:36:31.923 --> 00:36:32.925 align:middle line:90%
