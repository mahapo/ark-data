>> Robert Phoenix: Welcome
back to "The Eleventh House."

00:00:23.323 --> 00:00:25.525 align:middle line:84%
This is Robert Phoenix,
and as you can see,

00:00:25.525 --> 00:00:27.060 align:middle line:84%
things have changed
just a little bit

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:31.263 align:middle line:84%
since the last time we
met on Gaiam TV together.

00:00:31.263 --> 00:00:36.069 align:middle line:84%
And there's a reason for
the change, and well part

00:00:36.069 --> 00:00:39.239 align:middle line:84%
of the reason is because
they saw me in that cafÃ©

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:43.944 align:middle line:84%
in Austin freezing my privates
off and they decided to bring me

00:00:43.944 --> 00:00:46.546 align:middle line:84%
to Boulder, Colorado where I
could freeze my privates off,

00:00:46.546 --> 00:00:48.815 align:middle line:84%
but at least since
I have a studio.

00:00:48.815 --> 00:00:51.218 align:middle line:84%
But there's kind of
another story to the change,

00:00:51.218 --> 00:00:52.819 align:middle line:84%
and that story has
to do with you.

00:00:52.819 --> 00:00:56.623 align:middle line:84%
I want to read you just a couple
of comments from the last show,

00:00:56.623 --> 00:01:00.994 align:middle line:84%
or at least after the last show
that you left on the website.

00:01:00.994 --> 00:01:03.563 align:middle line:84%
And this is to prove that
not only do we listen,

00:01:03.563 --> 00:01:05.699 align:middle line:84%
but you have the power
of manifestation.

00:01:05.699 --> 00:01:07.100 align:middle line:90%
And here are these comments.

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:13.073 align:middle line:84%
This is from Wha?,
that's W H A ?. Wha?

00:01:13.073 --> 00:01:17.844 align:middle line:84%
says, "It gives me pause about
the credibility of Mr. Phoenix

00:01:17.844 --> 00:01:21.648 align:middle line:84%
that he takes no notice
of the opportunity

00:01:21.648 --> 00:01:24.951 align:middle line:84%
to show us the pictures
he is trying to show us

00:01:24.951 --> 00:01:28.688 align:middle line:84%
at twice their size by
tapping the full-screen button

00:01:28.688 --> 00:01:32.392 align:middle line:84%
on the gallery viewing app
he has chosen to employ

00:01:32.392 --> 00:01:34.161 align:middle line:90%
for this presentation.

00:01:34.161 --> 00:01:36.630 align:middle line:90%
Producer, what gives?

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:40.033 align:middle line:84%
Millions of people
are viewing --

00:01:40.033 --> 00:01:41.468 align:middle line:90%
are going to spend half

00:01:41.468 --> 00:01:46.106 align:middle line:84%
that video watching a picture
slowly load, appear glared out

00:01:46.106 --> 00:01:48.642 align:middle line:84%
and small flash before
their eyes,

00:01:48.642 --> 00:01:52.512 align:middle line:84%
then disappear before it
can properly be examined,

00:01:52.512 --> 00:01:55.982 align:middle line:84%
while he points at the tiny
screen to make reference

00:01:55.982 --> 00:01:59.920 align:middle line:84%
and indications while farce
mocking self-awareness plays

00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:03.456 align:middle line:84%
out in one's mind, and instead
of listening to the details,

00:02:03.456 --> 00:02:05.625 align:middle line:90%
one finds oneself trying

00:02:05.625 --> 00:02:08.461 align:middle line:84%
to guess what he will
just stop and say.

00:02:08.461 --> 00:02:11.765 align:middle line:84%
Wait, this is silly, can
you even see the picture?

00:02:11.765 --> 00:02:13.567 align:middle line:84%
Is there a way to
make it bigger?

00:02:13.567 --> 00:02:17.437 align:middle line:84%
I care about this video, and I
want people to see this stuff

00:02:17.437 --> 00:02:20.440 align:middle line:84%
on behalf or the viewers
of the past and future.

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:25.445 align:middle line:84%
I implore you, Mr. Phoenix, to
give this one a personal gander,

00:02:25.445 --> 00:02:27.113 align:middle line:90%
and then record it again.

00:02:27.113 --> 00:02:29.616 align:middle line:84%
You will want to,
at the very least.

00:02:29.616 --> 00:02:31.451 align:middle line:90%
tape full screen."

00:02:31.451 --> 00:02:35.355 align:middle line:84%
Well, Mr. Wha?, or Miss
Wha?, look at this,

00:02:35.355 --> 00:02:37.023 align:middle line:90%
is that full enough for you?

00:02:37.023 --> 00:02:38.425 align:middle line:90%
There's more coming.

00:02:38.425 --> 00:02:40.861 align:middle line:84%
This is just the first image of
a load of images you're going

00:02:40.861 --> 00:02:43.028 align:middle line:84%
to be seeing for this episode
of "The Eleventh House."

00:02:43.028 --> 00:02:46.466 align:middle line:84%
We're going to get into
the 9/11 birth of Jesus.

00:02:46.466 --> 00:02:48.001 align:middle line:90%
Yes, that's the 9/11 birth.

00:02:48.001 --> 00:02:50.237 align:middle line:84%
But I'll tell you, here's
a little bit of an aside,

00:02:50.237 --> 00:02:53.306 align:middle line:84%
the reason why I could
not tap full screen out --

00:02:53.306 --> 00:02:57.510 align:middle line:84%
I tried, was because when I
did the program itself would

00:02:57.510 --> 00:02:58.511 align:middle line:90%
not advance.

00:02:58.511 --> 00:02:59.479 align:middle line:84%
I'm not talking about
this program,

00:02:59.479 --> 00:03:02.816 align:middle line:90%
but the program on my tablet.

00:03:02.816 --> 00:03:05.485 align:middle line:84%
So I tried, but it
couldn't be done.

00:03:05.485 --> 00:03:12.092 align:middle line:84%
However, thanks to your
notices and your comments,

00:03:12.092 --> 00:03:16.663 align:middle line:84%
I'm here right now today doing
this, in a much bigger way.

00:03:16.663 --> 00:03:18.064 align:middle line:84%
So that's the power
of manifestation.

00:03:18.064 --> 00:03:19.633 align:middle line:90%
And there's another one here.

00:03:19.633 --> 00:03:22.736 align:middle line:84%
Well, I found this very
entertaining and educational.

00:03:22.736 --> 00:03:27.340 align:middle line:84%
This is from B. Clammin,
or B.C. Lammin.

00:03:27.340 --> 00:03:31.778 align:middle line:84%
"I would have to agree with the
person below -- " that was Wha?,

00:03:31.778 --> 00:03:33.713 align:middle line:90%
"about the charts on the screen.

00:03:33.713 --> 00:03:37.050 align:middle line:84%
Obviously, the graphics
were added in after the fact

00:03:37.050 --> 00:03:40.520 align:middle line:84%
for our benefit, but they
needed to be left up longer

00:03:40.520 --> 00:03:43.056 align:middle line:84%
and full screen, as we
might actually be able

00:03:43.056 --> 00:03:45.058 align:middle line:84%
to see what Robert
was speaking about.

00:03:45.058 --> 00:03:49.028 align:middle line:84%
Even better would be a floating
arrow pointing between each item

00:03:49.028 --> 00:03:50.964 align:middle line:84%
on the chart that
he is referring to;

00:03:50.964 --> 00:03:52.932 align:middle line:84%
other than that I
really enjoyed this."

00:03:52.932 --> 00:03:55.302 align:middle line:84%
Well, I hope you're going to
enjoy the next episode here.

00:03:55.302 --> 00:03:56.870 align:middle line:84%
Instead of the pointing
arrow you're still going

00:03:56.870 --> 00:03:58.705 align:middle line:84%
to have my right
hand and my pointer.

00:03:58.705 --> 00:04:00.206 align:middle line:90%
This is the floating arrow.

00:04:00.206 --> 00:04:02.108 align:middle line:84%
So what we're going to do today
is we're going to get in --

00:04:02.108 --> 00:04:06.179 align:middle line:84%
by the way, thank you for those
comments on the show page for

00:04:06.179 --> 00:04:08.214 align:middle line:84%
"The Eleventh House"
and on the video.

00:04:08.214 --> 00:04:11.451 align:middle line:84%
And if you have anymore about
this or any other episode,

00:04:11.451 --> 00:04:13.953 align:middle line:84%
just let us know and we'll
be happy to bring them

00:04:13.953 --> 00:04:15.322 align:middle line:90%
up and incorporate them.

00:04:15.322 --> 00:04:18.191 align:middle line:84%
So today we're going to talk
about Jesus, who is probably one

00:04:18.191 --> 00:04:21.026 align:middle line:84%
of the most controversial
figures of all time,

00:04:21.026 --> 00:04:24.431 align:middle line:84%
and he's becoming even more
controversial in many ways.

00:04:24.431 --> 00:04:28.301 align:middle line:84%
In the astrological community
there is a thing called

00:04:28.301 --> 00:04:35.141 align:middle line:84%
"astrotheology," which kind
of makes a point to cast Jesus

00:04:35.141 --> 00:04:39.012 align:middle line:84%
as not just a person, but
really kind of an amalgamation

00:04:39.012 --> 00:04:41.948 align:middle line:84%
of planetary movements
across the sky

00:04:41.948 --> 00:04:46.486 align:middle line:84%
where he really isn't
a person, he's a star,

00:04:46.486 --> 00:04:48.421 align:middle line:90%
or he's a constellation.

00:04:48.421 --> 00:04:54.427 align:middle line:84%
And he's, you know, translated
into either being Osiris,

00:04:54.427 --> 00:04:58.198 align:middle line:84%
or Apollo, or he's not
actually who he purports to be.

00:04:58.198 --> 00:05:01.634 align:middle line:84%
And in fact there is this
whole doctrine in astrotheology

00:05:01.634 --> 00:05:04.571 align:middle line:84%
which says, "Well, His life
did not occur the way it was

00:05:04.571 --> 00:05:06.806 align:middle line:84%
supposed to occur, or
the beginning of His life

00:05:06.806 --> 00:05:11.010 align:middle line:84%
on December 25th," which is the
date that astrotheologists use

00:05:11.010 --> 00:05:13.847 align:middle line:84%
for the birth of Jesus, "then
we can't take it seriously."

00:05:13.847 --> 00:05:16.750 align:middle line:84%
Well, I'm going to bring you
another date over the course

00:05:16.750 --> 00:05:18.018 align:middle line:90%
of the next half hour or so.

00:05:18.018 --> 00:05:21.955 align:middle line:84%
We're going to be
looking at 9/11 3BC to see

00:05:21.955 --> 00:05:25.058 align:middle line:84%
if we can make a case that Jesus
or Sanat,

00:05:25.058 --> 00:05:26.426 align:middle line:90%
as I like to call Him,

00:05:26.426 --> 00:05:29.295 align:middle line:84%
was actually born
then, and not on 12/25.

00:05:29.295 --> 00:05:31.431 align:middle line:90%
The 12/25 date has its issues.

00:05:31.431 --> 00:05:34.167 align:middle line:84%
You know, I mean, it's
basically the celebration

00:05:34.167 --> 00:05:36.503 align:middle line:90%
of Sol Invictus, and Saturnalia.

00:05:36.503 --> 00:05:38.471 align:middle line:84%
These are Pagan holidays,
and then they make sense

00:05:38.471 --> 00:05:42.876 align:middle line:84%
if you wanted to convert a bunch
of Pagans to celebrate the birth

00:05:42.876 --> 00:05:46.813 align:middle line:84%
of Jesus, you would just move
it to 12/25 and it would be,

00:05:46.813 --> 00:05:49.882 align:middle line:84%
you know, kind of a smorgasbord
of belief for everybody.

00:05:49.882 --> 00:05:55.255 align:middle line:84%
But what's happened is, is that
the 12/25 date has turned into,

00:05:55.255 --> 00:05:58.725 align:middle line:84%
well, Black Friday, and
it's become an incredibly

00:05:58.725 --> 00:05:59.826 align:middle line:90%
commercial event.

00:05:59.826 --> 00:06:03.797 align:middle line:84%
It's anything but the
birth of, you know,

00:06:03.797 --> 00:06:05.965 align:middle line:90%
the Son of God on this planet.

00:06:05.965 --> 00:06:08.735 align:middle line:84%
It's become a crassly
commercialized,

00:06:08.735 --> 00:06:12.972 align:middle line:90%
capitalized orgy of consumption.

00:06:12.972 --> 00:06:16.509 align:middle line:84%
And this is supposed to be the
day that we celebrate the birth

00:06:16.509 --> 00:06:18.078 align:middle line:90%
of this light into the world.

00:06:18.078 --> 00:06:21.648 align:middle line:84%
Well, the day that I'm
talking about, 9/11,

00:06:21.648 --> 00:06:25.251 align:middle line:84%
it has a whole other
story associated with it.

00:06:25.251 --> 00:06:29.088 align:middle line:84%
And if that is the day that
Jesus was supposedly born,

00:06:29.088 --> 00:06:32.158 align:middle line:84%
what do we do on
9/11, we bow our heads

00:06:32.158 --> 00:06:37.063 align:middle line:84%
and we solemnify the tragedy of
the collapse

00:06:37.063 --> 00:06:39.833 align:middle line:84%
of the Twin Towers, the
Pentagon, Shanks Field,

00:06:39.833 --> 00:06:42.001 align:middle line:84%
and everything that's
gone on since then.

00:06:42.001 --> 00:06:44.971 align:middle line:84%
So in celebrating 9/11 --
instead of celebrating 9/11,

00:06:44.971 --> 00:06:46.406 align:middle line:90%
what do we do, we mourn it.

00:06:46.406 --> 00:06:48.308 align:middle line:90%
It's an interesting mind trick.

00:06:48.308 --> 00:06:52.445 align:middle line:84%
12/25 we're supposed to
celebrate, but we partake

00:06:52.445 --> 00:06:54.714 align:middle line:84%
in this orgiastic
ritual consumption.

00:06:54.714 --> 00:06:57.750 align:middle line:84%
9/11 theoretically we would be
celebrating, but what do we do,

00:06:57.750 --> 00:07:03.056 align:middle line:84%
we bow our heads in silence,
in prayer, and it becomes one

00:07:03.056 --> 00:07:04.657 align:middle line:84%
of the black marks
on the history

00:07:04.657 --> 00:07:06.125 align:middle line:84%
of the United States
and the world.

00:07:06.125 --> 00:07:07.627 align:middle line:84%
We're going to get
into that a little bit.

00:07:07.627 --> 00:07:09.829 align:middle line:84%
So let's jump into
it right away.

00:07:09.829 --> 00:07:13.233 align:middle line:84%
And the next image here you're
going to see, pretty simple,

00:07:13.233 --> 00:07:16.236 align:middle line:84%
pretty straightforward, this
is of course a modern depiction

00:07:16.236 --> 00:07:19.873 align:middle line:84%
of the Nativity scene as
it happened in Jerusalem.

00:07:19.873 --> 00:07:25.645 align:middle line:84%
And this would be 3BC, be,
you know, 3 years before 33,

00:07:25.645 --> 00:07:28.414 align:middle line:84%
which was theoretically the
end of the life of Jesus.

00:07:28.414 --> 00:07:31.384 align:middle line:90%
So we go back to 3BC.

00:07:31.384 --> 00:07:35.455 align:middle line:84%
And we're going to get into some
really interesting information

00:07:35.455 --> 00:07:36.523 align:middle line:90%
that I ran across.

00:07:36.523 --> 00:07:39.858 align:middle line:84%
And this comes from
a Biblical scholar.

00:07:39.858 --> 00:07:41.928 align:middle line:84%
And I wanted to read
this to you.

00:07:41.928 --> 00:07:45.398 align:middle line:84%
His name is "Joseph Dumond,"
and he wrote a book called,

00:07:45.398 --> 00:07:49.769 align:middle line:84%
"Remembering Sabbatical
Years of 2016, 2023,

00:07:49.769 --> 00:07:53.706 align:middle line:90%
2030, 2037, and 2044."

00:07:53.706 --> 00:07:56.108 align:middle line:84%
So according to him, these
are the sabbatical years.

00:07:56.108 --> 00:08:01.014 align:middle line:84%
But what he did is he got into
this passage from Revelations.

00:08:01.014 --> 00:08:02.081 align:middle line:84%
We're going to read
this together.

00:08:02.081 --> 00:08:03.883 align:middle line:90%
This is Revelations 12:15.

00:08:03.883 --> 00:08:09.389 align:middle line:84%
So we're starting at the end,
which perhaps gives us a clue

00:08:09.389 --> 00:08:10.890 align:middle line:84%
about the beginning, or
at least the beginning

00:08:10.890 --> 00:08:12.292 align:middle line:90%
of The New Testament.

00:08:12.292 --> 00:08:14.661 align:middle line:84%
"And there appeared a
great wonder in heaven,

00:08:14.661 --> 00:08:19.299 align:middle line:84%
a woman clothed with the sun
and the moon under her feet,

00:08:19.299 --> 00:08:22.869 align:middle line:84%
and upon her head a
crown of 12 stars."

00:08:22.869 --> 00:08:27.173 align:middle line:84%
Of course, the number 12
represents the number of houses

00:08:27.173 --> 00:08:29.175 align:middle line:90%
and planets in the zodiac.

00:08:29.175 --> 00:08:33.378 align:middle line:84%
"And she being with child
pride, travailing in birth

00:08:33.378 --> 00:08:35.748 align:middle line:90%
and pained to be delivered.

00:08:35.748 --> 00:08:39.017 align:middle line:84%
And there appeared
another wonder in heaven,

00:08:39.017 --> 00:08:43.623 align:middle line:84%
and behold a great red dragon
having 7 heads and 10 horns

00:08:43.623 --> 00:08:48.094 align:middle line:84%
and 7 crowns upon its head
and its tail drew the 3rd part

00:08:48.094 --> 00:08:51.864 align:middle line:84%
of the stars of heaven and
did cast them to the earth.

00:08:51.864 --> 00:08:55.201 align:middle line:84%
And the dragon stood before
the woman, which was ready

00:08:55.201 --> 00:08:57.737 align:middle line:84%
to be delivered for
to devour her child

00:08:57.737 --> 00:08:59.572 align:middle line:90%
as soon as it was born.

00:08:59.572 --> 00:09:02.075 align:middle line:84%
And she brought forth
a man child who was

00:09:02.075 --> 00:09:05.445 align:middle line:84%
to rule all nations
with a rod of iron.

00:09:05.445 --> 00:09:10.250 align:middle line:84%
And her child was caught up
onto God and to His throne."

00:09:10.250 --> 00:09:13.753 align:middle line:84%
Now, it's this passage
that Dumond thinks

00:09:13.753 --> 00:09:17.190 align:middle line:84%
that there was a clue to the
actual birth date of Jesus.

00:09:17.190 --> 00:09:18.791 align:middle line:90%
Now, this is directly from him.

00:09:18.791 --> 00:09:20.360 align:middle line:90%
This is what he says.

00:09:20.360 --> 00:09:21.995 align:middle line:84%
He says, "The key
to the very day

00:09:21.995 --> 00:09:26.733 align:middle line:84%
of Jesus' birth is the words,
"And the moon under her feet."

00:09:26.733 --> 00:09:28.368 align:middle line:90%
The word "under" signifies

00:09:28.368 --> 00:09:31.904 align:middle line:84%
that the woman's feet were
positioned just over the moon.

00:09:31.904 --> 00:09:35.475 align:middle line:84%
So it's the feet of Virgo
represent the last 7 degrees

00:09:35.475 --> 00:09:37.076 align:middle line:90%
of the constellation.

00:09:37.076 --> 00:09:40.947 align:middle line:84%
In the time of Christ this would
have been about 180 degrees

00:09:40.947 --> 00:09:44.017 align:middle line:84%
and 187 degrees along
the elliptic.

00:09:44.017 --> 00:09:46.219 align:middle line:84%
The moon has to be
positioned somewhere

00:09:46.219 --> 00:09:48.154 align:middle line:90%
under the 7-degree arch.

00:09:48.154 --> 00:09:52.025 align:middle line:84%
But the moon also has to
be in that exact location

00:09:52.025 --> 00:09:54.560 align:middle line:84%
when the sun is mid
body to Virgo.

00:09:54.560 --> 00:09:58.731 align:middle line:84%
In the year 3BC, these 2 factors
came to precise agreement

00:09:58.731 --> 00:09:59.932 align:middle line:90%
for less than 2 hours,

00:09:59.932 --> 00:10:03.770 align:middle line:84%
as observed from
Palestine on September 11th.

00:10:03.770 --> 00:10:08.307 align:middle line:84%
The precise arrangement began
at about 6:15 pm sunset,

00:10:08.307 --> 00:10:12.378 align:middle line:84%
and lasted until
7:45 pm noon set.

00:10:12.378 --> 00:10:15.915 align:middle line:84%
This is the only day
in the whole year

00:10:15.915 --> 00:10:18.251 align:middle line:84%
that this could have
taken place.

00:10:18.251 --> 00:10:21.321 align:middle line:84%
So with that in mind, what
I decided to do is I decided

00:10:21.321 --> 00:10:25.992 align:middle line:84%
to explore that day, 9/11, and
look at the chart and then look

00:10:25.992 --> 00:10:27.894 align:middle line:90%
at 9/11 through history to see

00:10:27.894 --> 00:10:30.296 align:middle line:84%
if we can find some
correspondences.

00:10:30.296 --> 00:10:32.632 align:middle line:84%
And what I came up with,
it's pretty interesting.

00:10:32.632 --> 00:10:39.138 align:middle line:84%
Now, unfortunately I could not
get to the same kind of angle

00:10:39.138 --> 00:10:42.709 align:middle line:84%
that Dumond was talking
about, but I got close.

00:10:42.709 --> 00:10:44.977 align:middle line:90%
And we're going to explore this.

00:10:44.977 --> 00:10:47.914 align:middle line:84%
This is the chart of
the birth time of Jesus.

00:10:47.914 --> 00:10:50.283 align:middle line:90%
Now, I have it at 6:50 pm.

00:10:50.283 --> 00:10:52.985 align:middle line:84%
And this was just
pretty, I don't know,

00:10:52.985 --> 00:10:55.855 align:middle line:84%
intuitive on my part, but
if you look at the chart,

00:10:55.855 --> 00:10:58.458 align:middle line:84%
there are some amazing
things happening here.

00:10:58.458 --> 00:11:01.794 align:middle line:84%
Here we have a grand trine
taking place, earth trine,

00:11:01.794 --> 00:11:04.597 align:middle line:90%
Virgo, Taurus, Capricorn.

00:11:04.597 --> 00:11:07.333 align:middle line:84%
We also have what's called
"a mystic rectangle."

00:11:07.333 --> 00:11:11.304 align:middle line:84%
And there is another kite
pattern happening

00:11:11.304 --> 00:11:12.171 align:middle line:90%
up here as well.

00:11:12.171 --> 00:11:14.140 align:middle line:90%
This is a very complex chart.

00:11:14.140 --> 00:11:16.142 align:middle line:84%
And I could tell you
that if I read this chart

00:11:16.142 --> 00:11:19.412 align:middle line:84%
for any individual, it
would be a memorable chart,

00:11:19.412 --> 00:11:22.482 align:middle line:84%
because of all the
activity, all the angles,

00:11:22.482 --> 00:11:24.584 align:middle line:84%
and some of the key
oppositions in the chart.

00:11:24.584 --> 00:11:27.153 align:middle line:84%
So let's just start
with the first house.

00:11:27.153 --> 00:11:30.690 align:middle line:84%
Here we have the sign of Aries
on the ascending at 3 degrees.

00:11:30.690 --> 00:11:34.360 align:middle line:84%
Initially, I had this at
0 degrees, but I played

00:11:34.360 --> 00:11:36.195 align:middle line:84%
around with it, and I
really liked the 3 degree

00:11:36.195 --> 00:11:38.631 align:middle line:84%
because of the trinity, Father,
Son, Holy Ghost, that whole sort

00:11:38.631 --> 00:11:41.000 align:middle line:84%
of thing, and of course, you
know, Jesus, Mary and Joseph.

00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:43.269 align:middle line:84%
So the number 3 comes
up over here.

00:11:43.269 --> 00:11:45.471 align:middle line:84%
And then the thing that
really jumped out at me

00:11:45.471 --> 00:11:47.640 align:middle line:90%
about this chart is this.

00:11:47.640 --> 00:11:50.009 align:middle line:90%
This is Uranus and Pisces.

00:11:50.009 --> 00:11:53.546 align:middle line:84%
And whenever we think of
Jesus, Sanat, Emmanuel,

00:11:53.546 --> 00:11:55.782 align:middle line:90%
we think of the Piscean Age.

00:11:55.782 --> 00:12:00.720 align:middle line:84%
And here we have Uranus, which
is the planet that's associated

00:12:00.720 --> 00:12:05.224 align:middle line:84%
with radical action, with
breakthrough, with electricity,

00:12:05.224 --> 00:12:10.429 align:middle line:84%
dynamism, chaos, upsetting
the previous order before.

00:12:10.429 --> 00:12:13.599 align:middle line:84%
So we have Uranus and
Pisces in the 12th House.

00:12:13.599 --> 00:12:16.969 align:middle line:84%
So the 12th House I like to
call "The House of God," or,

00:12:16.969 --> 00:12:18.204 align:middle line:90%
"The House of the Soul."

00:12:18.204 --> 00:12:19.272 align:middle line:90%
It's the hidden house.

00:12:19.272 --> 00:12:21.908 align:middle line:84%
It's the one house
where everything happens

00:12:21.908 --> 00:12:24.110 align:middle line:90%
at a very, very deep level.

00:12:24.110 --> 00:12:28.948 align:middle line:84%
So we have this radical aspect
happening in the 12th House.

00:12:28.948 --> 00:12:32.051 align:middle line:84%
Now, if we go across from the
12th House, what do we see?

00:12:32.051 --> 00:12:34.520 align:middle line:84%
We have an alignment
of Virgo here.

00:12:34.520 --> 00:12:35.955 align:middle line:90%
There is Pluto and Virgo.

00:12:35.955 --> 00:12:40.092 align:middle line:84%
Now, remember that it's going to
come up later on in this talk,

00:12:40.092 --> 00:12:42.528 align:middle line:84%
and it's going to make a
pretty interesting impact.

00:12:42.528 --> 00:12:46.165 align:middle line:84%
Pluto and Virgo, sun and
Virgo, Mercury and Virgo,

00:12:46.165 --> 00:12:48.668 align:middle line:84%
Venus and Virgo; and then we
have fixed stars, Arcturis

00:12:48.668 --> 00:12:50.736 align:middle line:90%
and Spica, all in Virgo,

00:12:50.736 --> 00:12:53.372 align:middle line:84%
all in the 6th House,
Virgo's own house.

00:12:53.372 --> 00:12:59.111 align:middle line:84%
And here we have the alignment,
or the aspect ratio of somebody

00:12:59.111 --> 00:13:01.814 align:middle line:84%
that is born to serve,
because that's what Virgo does.

00:13:01.814 --> 00:13:03.950 align:middle line:90%
Virgo is all about service.

00:13:03.950 --> 00:13:06.152 align:middle line:90%
And this person loaded the deck.

00:13:06.152 --> 00:13:07.386 align:middle line:90%
I mean, if they wanted to serve,

00:13:07.386 --> 00:13:09.822 align:middle line:84%
they couldn't have had
more Virgo on their chart.

00:13:09.822 --> 00:13:12.859 align:middle line:84%
And Virgo also represents
healing, as well,

00:13:12.859 --> 00:13:15.328 align:middle line:84%
not just service, and
not just mission, purpose

00:13:15.328 --> 00:13:16.729 align:middle line:90%
and dharma, but healing.

00:13:16.729 --> 00:13:20.132 align:middle line:84%
And when we have the sun,
conjunct Pluto with that close

00:13:20.132 --> 00:13:22.768 align:middle line:84%
to a degree, this is a
transformational personality.

00:13:22.768 --> 00:13:23.703 align:middle line:90%
This is somebody --

00:13:23.703 --> 00:13:25.538 align:middle line:84%
theoretically when
we have the sun

00:13:25.538 --> 00:13:28.241 align:middle line:84%
and Pluto together while they
may not necessarily be able

00:13:28.241 --> 00:13:29.308 align:middle line:90%
to raise the dead,

00:13:29.308 --> 00:13:31.944 align:middle line:84%
they certainly would
give it a good shot.

00:13:31.944 --> 00:13:36.749 align:middle line:84%
And who knows, given the right
herbs or the right, you know,

00:13:36.749 --> 00:13:39.852 align:middle line:84%
meditational practice or yoga,
or whatever was happening then,

00:13:39.852 --> 00:13:42.121 align:middle line:90%
or direct connection to spirit,

00:13:42.121 --> 00:13:44.290 align:middle line:84%
miracles could occur
here in the 6th House.

00:13:44.290 --> 00:13:46.792 align:middle line:84%
Now, what I -- what's
fascinating about this is,

00:13:46.792 --> 00:13:49.228 align:middle line:84%
is that we have this radical
aspect in the 12th House,

00:13:49.228 --> 00:13:52.231 align:middle line:84%
which is Pisces, and this is
somebody who's struggling,

00:13:52.231 --> 00:13:57.169 align:middle line:84%
right, they're struggling to
hear what the source is saying.

00:13:57.169 --> 00:14:01.040 align:middle line:84%
And the source may say,
"You might have to do things

00:14:01.040 --> 00:14:02.708 align:middle line:90%
that are unusual," right?

00:14:02.708 --> 00:14:06.512 align:middle line:84%
This would be something along
the lines of riding on top

00:14:06.512 --> 00:14:09.415 align:middle line:84%
of an ass, you know,
into the kingdom.

00:14:09.415 --> 00:14:10.449 align:middle line:90%
Well, why an ass?

00:14:10.449 --> 00:14:12.351 align:middle line:84%
You know, why not
walk into a kingdom?

00:14:12.351 --> 00:14:15.488 align:middle line:84%
Well, maybe the ass is about,
you know, humbling one's self,

00:14:15.488 --> 00:14:18.157 align:middle line:90%
or, you know, there's a method

00:14:18.157 --> 00:14:21.160 align:middle line:84%
to the madness here
in the 12th House.

00:14:21.160 --> 00:14:23.329 align:middle line:84%
But it doesn't come out
until it goes all the way

00:14:23.329 --> 00:14:26.565 align:middle line:84%
across the chart into the
6th where it manifests.

00:14:26.565 --> 00:14:30.136 align:middle line:84%
So we have this dynamic
between this Piscean urge

00:14:30.136 --> 00:14:34.073 align:middle line:84%
to hear the small still voice
in a radically different way,

00:14:34.073 --> 00:14:36.175 align:middle line:90%
and to make it manifest with all

00:14:36.175 --> 00:14:38.611 align:middle line:84%
of this service in
the 6th House.

00:14:38.611 --> 00:14:40.513 align:middle line:90%
Now, being Aries or Aries

00:14:40.513 --> 00:14:43.716 align:middle line:84%
on the ascendant is also very
important because when we think

00:14:43.716 --> 00:14:47.019 align:middle line:84%
of Aries we think of pure
undifferentiated will.

00:14:47.019 --> 00:14:49.221 align:middle line:84%
Body, mind, spirit,
that's what Aries does.

00:14:49.221 --> 00:14:50.323 align:middle line:90%
Aries doesn't even think.

00:14:50.323 --> 00:14:52.425 align:middle line:90%
Aries is just doing.

00:14:52.425 --> 00:14:54.894 align:middle line:90%
It's just doing, doing, doing.

00:14:54.894 --> 00:14:58.064 align:middle line:84%
And so with Aries on the
ascending here, we find somebody

00:14:58.064 --> 00:15:03.302 align:middle line:84%
who has a mastery of will, born
into the chart at some level.

00:15:03.302 --> 00:15:05.471 align:middle line:90%
So we see that right here.

00:15:05.471 --> 00:15:08.040 align:middle line:84%
And there's a lot of
other things happening.

00:15:08.040 --> 00:15:10.042 align:middle line:90%
Let's go down to the 5th House.

00:15:10.042 --> 00:15:11.143 align:middle line:84%
What do we have in
the 5th House?

00:15:11.143 --> 00:15:12.278 align:middle line:90%
We have Jupiter and Leo.

00:15:12.278 --> 00:15:14.046 align:middle line:84%
Remember that; that's
going to come up later.

00:15:14.046 --> 00:15:17.049 align:middle line:84%
And we also have
Regulus, also and Leo.

00:15:17.049 --> 00:15:20.953 align:middle line:84%
And Regulus and Leo, Jupiter
and Leo, in the 5th House,

00:15:20.953 --> 00:15:22.488 align:middle line:84%
which is also Leo,
what do we have?

00:15:22.488 --> 00:15:24.790 align:middle line:90%
We have the king of kings.

00:15:24.790 --> 00:15:28.928 align:middle line:84%
Leo represents the king,
and we have 2 aspects here,

00:15:28.928 --> 00:15:31.564 align:middle line:84%
the 1 and the 2, which is
the father and the son,

00:15:31.564 --> 00:15:33.666 align:middle line:84%
also taking place
in the 5th House.

00:15:33.666 --> 00:15:36.802 align:middle line:84%
Very interesting development,
sign of the king of kings,

00:15:36.802 --> 00:15:40.373 align:middle line:84%
royalty -- born of
royalty in the 5th House.

00:15:40.373 --> 00:15:42.174 align:middle line:84%
Now, one of the things
I also liked

00:15:42.174 --> 00:15:43.476 align:middle line:90%
about this chart is the fact

00:15:43.476 --> 00:15:46.078 align:middle line:84%
that Altair is on
the mid-heaven.

00:15:46.078 --> 00:15:49.248 align:middle line:84%
And Altair -- if
you were perhaps one

00:15:49.248 --> 00:15:51.684 align:middle line:84%
of the 3 Nagy [phonetic]
at that time,

00:15:51.684 --> 00:15:54.854 align:middle line:84%
you might actually notice
Altair at the mid-heaven.

00:15:54.854 --> 00:15:57.189 align:middle line:90%
And Altair is the symbol of --

00:15:57.189 --> 00:15:58.824 align:middle line:84%
we'll look at this
in just a second,

00:15:58.824 --> 00:16:00.893 align:middle line:90%
is the symbol of the eagle.

00:16:00.893 --> 00:16:03.229 align:middle line:90%
And the eagle is vision.

00:16:03.229 --> 00:16:06.332 align:middle line:90%
The eagle is truth.

00:16:06.332 --> 00:16:10.236 align:middle line:84%
The eagle is the higher
manifestation of Scorpio.

00:16:10.236 --> 00:16:13.039 align:middle line:84%
It is taking the baser
instincts of Scorpio,

00:16:13.039 --> 00:16:15.274 align:middle line:84%
which is the serpent,
transmutating it,

00:16:15.274 --> 00:16:19.712 align:middle line:84%
manifesting into the eagle, and
the eagle is flying right here

00:16:19.712 --> 00:16:21.914 align:middle line:84%
at the height of the
chart in the mid-heaven.

00:16:21.914 --> 00:16:23.282 align:middle line:90%
I love this.

00:16:23.282 --> 00:16:27.186 align:middle line:84%
Now, we have Mars and Capricorn,
we have Mars trining Pluto,

00:16:27.186 --> 00:16:30.456 align:middle line:84%
Mars trining the sun,
Mars trining Mercury,

00:16:30.456 --> 00:16:34.627 align:middle line:84%
Mars coming down and trining
Saturn, down in the 2nd House.

00:16:34.627 --> 00:16:36.162 align:middle line:84%
Now, Saturn in the 2nd House
is fascinating as well.

00:16:36.162 --> 00:16:37.430 align:middle line:90%
It's in Taurus.

00:16:37.430 --> 00:16:40.833 align:middle line:84%
And kind of a general
interpretation of Saturn

00:16:40.833 --> 00:16:45.271 align:middle line:84%
in the 2nd House is some kind
of poverty consciousness.

00:16:45.271 --> 00:16:50.709 align:middle line:84%
And that could be born of a
very simple and perhaps poor --

00:16:50.709 --> 00:16:52.478 align:middle line:90%
coming from a poor upbringing.

00:16:52.478 --> 00:16:54.513 align:middle line:84%
That would be Saturn
in the 2nd House.

00:16:54.513 --> 00:16:58.150 align:middle line:84%
Or it could be in some cases
where love or some kind

00:16:58.150 --> 00:17:01.353 align:middle line:84%
of material reward is
withheld from the individual.

00:17:01.353 --> 00:17:04.623 align:middle line:84%
So this would represent in some
ways a very humble beginning

00:17:04.623 --> 00:17:07.393 align:middle line:84%
with Taurus -- we're talking
about the earth, you know,

00:17:07.393 --> 00:17:12.364 align:middle line:84%
on land, or, you know, perhaps
straddling a little bed of hay

00:17:12.364 --> 00:17:13.798 align:middle line:90%
with some farm animals.

00:17:13.798 --> 00:17:16.067 align:middle line:84%
That's Saturn and
Taurus in the 2nd House.

00:17:16.067 --> 00:17:18.737 align:middle line:84%
But what Mars, and
Saturn, and the sun

00:17:18.737 --> 00:17:22.240 align:middle line:84%
and Pluto all do here is they
form this grand earth trine.

00:17:22.240 --> 00:17:24.076 align:middle line:84%
And this is somebody
who can manifest.

00:17:24.076 --> 00:17:27.613 align:middle line:84%
This is someone who can really
use, again, the elements

00:17:27.613 --> 00:17:30.416 align:middle line:84%
of the earth, the elements of
the will -- Mars is the will,

00:17:30.416 --> 00:17:34.086 align:middle line:84%
it's Aries rules Mars, and what
do we have Mars doing here,

00:17:34.086 --> 00:17:36.322 align:middle line:84%
it's trining the sun,
it's trining Pluto.

00:17:36.322 --> 00:17:39.225 align:middle line:84%
It gives us individual
power, endurance,

00:17:39.225 --> 00:17:43.562 align:middle line:84%
and there's a humility born
into this earth trine as well.

00:17:43.562 --> 00:17:46.098 align:middle line:84%
Now, what's also
fascinating here --

00:17:46.098 --> 00:17:49.001 align:middle line:84%
and we don't have time to go
through the entire components

00:17:49.001 --> 00:17:51.837 align:middle line:84%
of the chart, I'm just bringing
up the highlights, is over here

00:17:51.837 --> 00:17:54.006 align:middle line:84%
in the 11th House
that's his true node.

00:17:54.006 --> 00:17:57.710 align:middle line:84%
And it's in the sign of
Aquarius, which is fascinating.

00:17:57.710 --> 00:18:02.081 align:middle line:84%
So what we have here is
He's actually setting

00:18:02.081 --> 00:18:06.385 align:middle line:84%
up His relationship with
His 12 disciples, right?

00:18:06.385 --> 00:18:07.853 align:middle line:90%
That's the 11th House.

00:18:07.853 --> 00:18:11.090 align:middle line:84%
He's going to meet people who
are going to listen to Him

00:18:11.090 --> 00:18:14.560 align:middle line:84%
and they're going to -- if
not necessarily follow Him,

00:18:14.560 --> 00:18:19.999 align:middle line:84%
they're certainly going to
try to emulate His actions,

00:18:19.999 --> 00:18:22.935 align:middle line:84%
His words, His wisdom, and
to do it in their own way.

00:18:22.935 --> 00:18:26.238 align:middle line:84%
But not only that, but
I think the template

00:18:26.238 --> 00:18:28.908 align:middle line:84%
for the real Aquarian
Age, the Aquarian Age

00:18:28.908 --> 00:18:31.043 align:middle line:84%
that I don't think we're
actually really embodying right

00:18:31.043 --> 00:18:32.945 align:middle line:84%
now, is right here
in this chart.

00:18:32.945 --> 00:18:36.081 align:middle line:84%
I think that's where the
message is, it's at 14 degrees,

00:18:36.081 --> 00:18:38.918 align:middle line:84%
true node, in Aquarius,
in the 11th House,

00:18:38.918 --> 00:18:40.352 align:middle line:90%
which is the sign of Aquarius.

00:18:40.352 --> 00:18:41.854 align:middle line:84%
He's essentially
setting everything

00:18:41.854 --> 00:18:44.056 align:middle line:90%
up for the next 2,000 years.

00:18:44.056 --> 00:18:47.293 align:middle line:84%
And we're going to get into
that again as we move further

00:18:47.293 --> 00:18:51.964 align:middle line:84%
into the 9/11 experience
and this mystery here.

00:18:51.964 --> 00:18:56.869 align:middle line:84%
Now, in the 8th House, we have
Antares, and we have Neptune,

00:18:56.869 --> 00:18:58.170 align:middle line:90%
and there's the galactic center.

00:18:58.170 --> 00:19:00.339 align:middle line:90%
It's actually at 29, Scorpio.

00:19:00.339 --> 00:19:01.874 align:middle line:84%
The galactic center
currently I think is

00:19:01.874 --> 00:19:05.344 align:middle line:90%
at 26 or 27, Sagittarius.

00:19:05.344 --> 00:19:07.813 align:middle line:84%
So it's moved an entire
constellation since then.

00:19:07.813 --> 00:19:11.984 align:middle line:84%
But the 11th -- the 8th
House is an occult house.

00:19:11.984 --> 00:19:15.120 align:middle line:84%
It's sex, and death,
and transformation.

00:19:15.120 --> 00:19:16.388 align:middle line:90%
There can be violence.

00:19:16.388 --> 00:19:20.192 align:middle line:84%
And Antares, one of the
sub-rulers of Antares is Mars.

00:19:20.192 --> 00:19:21.794 align:middle line:90%
It's associated with Mars.

00:19:21.794 --> 00:19:22.895 align:middle line:90%
And what do we have here?

00:19:22.895 --> 00:19:25.064 align:middle line:84%
We have the potential
for real violence,

00:19:25.064 --> 00:19:27.866 align:middle line:84%
and even hidden enemies
in the 8th House.

00:19:27.866 --> 00:19:30.135 align:middle line:84%
And there is Neptune
and Scorpio.

00:19:30.135 --> 00:19:31.537 align:middle line:90%
Remember that.

00:19:31.537 --> 00:19:34.073 align:middle line:90%
It's an important aspect.

00:19:34.073 --> 00:19:38.811 align:middle line:84%
And of course if you take
29 and convert that into 11,

00:19:38.811 --> 00:19:42.014 align:middle line:84%
you have 11 with a galactic
center, 11 with Antares,

00:19:42.014 --> 00:19:44.250 align:middle line:90%
11 with Neptune, and that's 33.

00:19:44.250 --> 00:19:47.152 align:middle line:84%
That's how long Jesus lives
theoretically, right, 33 years.

00:19:47.152 --> 00:19:49.622 align:middle line:84%
And it's all there in the
8th House, which is the house

00:19:49.622 --> 00:19:51.824 align:middle line:84%
of birth, death, sex
and transformation.

00:19:51.824 --> 00:19:54.693 align:middle line:84%
Neptune, again, a very important
aspect which we'll be talking

00:19:54.693 --> 00:19:57.963 align:middle line:84%
about later in not too
short of period of time --

00:19:57.963 --> 00:19:59.365 align:middle line:84%
not too long of a
period of time.

00:19:59.365 --> 00:20:02.234 align:middle line:84%
Now, here we have
the moon in Scorpio,

00:20:02.234 --> 00:20:04.536 align:middle line:84%
and the moon is square
in Jupiter.

00:20:04.536 --> 00:20:07.406 align:middle line:84%
And this is kind of a
struggle in dealing with power

00:20:07.406 --> 00:20:09.141 align:middle line:84%
and dealing with the realm
of the census, right?

00:20:09.141 --> 00:20:14.546 align:middle line:84%
So Jupiter and Leo is also
-- it's not just royalty,

00:20:14.546 --> 00:20:17.016 align:middle line:84%
but it's dealing with
the royalty of that time.

00:20:17.016 --> 00:20:19.652 align:middle line:84%
And the royalty of that
time were the Pharacies.

00:20:19.652 --> 00:20:23.222 align:middle line:84%
And here there's a very strong
conflict between the moon

00:20:23.222 --> 00:20:28.661 align:middle line:84%
and Scorpio, which can be
possessive, it can be magnetic,

00:20:28.661 --> 00:20:31.730 align:middle line:84%
deeply sexual, but also
very, very territorial,

00:20:31.730 --> 00:20:36.468 align:middle line:84%
and it's squaring off against
this whole notion of power

00:20:36.468 --> 00:20:39.638 align:middle line:84%
and royalty and in
the 5th House.

00:20:39.638 --> 00:20:41.140 align:middle line:90%
So there is a conflict.

00:20:41.140 --> 00:20:43.375 align:middle line:84%
There's a conflict that's
bred into the chart.

00:20:43.375 --> 00:20:45.744 align:middle line:84%
There's also another
conflict bred into the chart

00:20:45.744 --> 00:20:49.481 align:middle line:84%
with the opposition between
Saturn and Neptune as well.

00:20:49.481 --> 00:20:52.751 align:middle line:84%
And again, Saturn and Neptune
-- Saturn in the 2nd House,

00:20:52.751 --> 00:20:57.389 align:middle line:84%
and Taurus is humble, it's
earthy, it's grounded.

00:20:57.389 --> 00:21:03.228 align:middle line:84%
And Neptune and Scorpio
in the 8th there is --

00:21:03.228 --> 00:21:06.432 align:middle line:84%
for lack of a better
term, there is deceit

00:21:06.432 --> 00:21:09.268 align:middle line:84%
and there's illusion
that's being included here

00:21:09.268 --> 00:21:10.402 align:middle line:90%
in the 8th House.

00:21:10.402 --> 00:21:13.806 align:middle line:84%
I would say this is the
house of hidden enemies.

00:21:13.806 --> 00:21:20.646 align:middle line:84%
You know, theoretically
it was Pontius Pilate

00:21:20.646 --> 00:21:24.917 align:middle line:84%
and it was Mr. Longinus's
spirit of destiny,

00:21:24.917 --> 00:21:28.153 align:middle line:84%
Romans who killed
Jesus, and Antares,

00:21:28.153 --> 00:21:29.855 align:middle line:90%
again, is ruled by Mars.

00:21:29.855 --> 00:21:32.491 align:middle line:84%
So here we have Mars
in the 8th House.

00:21:32.491 --> 00:21:35.094 align:middle line:84%
And that can be a
portent of what was

00:21:35.094 --> 00:21:37.363 align:middle line:84%
about to take place
later on in his life.

00:21:37.363 --> 00:21:40.132 align:middle line:84%
It's an absolutely
fascinating chart.

00:21:40.132 --> 00:21:45.738 align:middle line:84%
And does it mean that Jesus was
born on 9/11, I would say based

00:21:45.738 --> 00:21:49.074 align:middle line:84%
on this and where we're headed
there this is probably a pretty

00:21:49.074 --> 00:21:51.643 align:middle line:84%
good possibility that
He was born on 9/11,

00:21:51.643 --> 00:21:55.214 align:middle line:84%
certainly it's a way
better date than 12/25.

00:21:55.214 --> 00:21:56.815 align:middle line:90%
Let's go onto the next slide.

00:21:56.815 --> 00:21:58.650 align:middle line:90%
This is Altair.

00:21:58.650 --> 00:22:00.586 align:middle line:84%
This is why it looks
like an eagle here.

00:22:00.586 --> 00:22:04.223 align:middle line:84%
I just wanted to give you
a kind of a representation

00:22:04.223 --> 00:22:06.158 align:middle line:90%
and a visual for Altair.

00:22:06.158 --> 00:22:08.060 align:middle line:90%
So here we have Henry Hudson.

00:22:08.060 --> 00:22:13.565 align:middle line:84%
And he's actually
discovering Manhattan.

00:22:13.565 --> 00:22:17.836 align:middle line:84%
And the day is September
11th, and the year is 1609.

00:22:17.836 --> 00:22:20.906 align:middle line:84%
Now, obviously there
are other people living

00:22:20.906 --> 00:22:23.175 align:middle line:90%
in Manhattan at the time.

00:22:23.175 --> 00:22:25.511 align:middle line:84%
But he's one of the
first Europeans

00:22:25.511 --> 00:22:29.581 align:middle line:84%
to actually lay his
eyes upon Manhattan.

00:22:29.581 --> 00:22:33.819 align:middle line:84%
And as we know, 9/11 will play a
significant role in the history

00:22:33.819 --> 00:22:36.422 align:middle line:90%
of Manhattan moving forward.

00:22:36.422 --> 00:22:38.924 align:middle line:84%
Now, this is one of the
few images I was able

00:22:38.924 --> 00:22:41.727 align:middle line:90%
to find around this.

00:22:41.727 --> 00:22:47.299 align:middle line:84%
There's going to be at least
4 to 5 events that are key

00:22:47.299 --> 00:22:51.170 align:middle line:84%
to the nation state of
Israel and it's development

00:22:51.170 --> 00:22:55.174 align:middle line:84%
and evolution that all
revolve around 9/11.

00:22:55.174 --> 00:22:59.611 align:middle line:84%
And this has to do with
what's called "The Nahalal."

00:22:59.611 --> 00:23:02.514 align:middle line:84%
This is the first
moshav in Palestine.

00:23:02.514 --> 00:23:04.583 align:middle line:90%
Nahalal is a community there.

00:23:04.583 --> 00:23:08.887 align:middle line:84%
And earlier on the Jewish
Colonization Association

00:23:08.887 --> 00:23:14.159 align:middle line:84%
in 1891 established by
Baron Maurice de Hirsch,

00:23:14.159 --> 00:23:16.562 align:middle line:84%
decided that it would
be a good idea

00:23:16.562 --> 00:23:22.167 align:middle line:84%
to colonize The Holy Land
again, and de Hirsch was pals

00:23:22.167 --> 00:23:26.305 align:middle line:84%
with Rothschild and a number of
other barons during that time.

00:23:26.305 --> 00:23:28.874 align:middle line:84%
Now, there were some
ideological differences

00:23:28.874 --> 00:23:31.543 align:middle line:84%
between de Hirsch
and Theodor Herzl.

00:23:31.543 --> 00:23:36.281 align:middle line:84%
De Hirsch was not a
dyed-in-the-wool Zionist,

00:23:36.281 --> 00:23:44.256 align:middle line:84%
but he had a very strong desire
to repatriate Israel as it were.

00:23:44.256 --> 00:23:50.562 align:middle line:84%
And this is a photo from
that first moshav, again,

00:23:50.562 --> 00:23:52.564 align:middle line:90%
Nahalal and Palestine.

00:23:52.564 --> 00:23:56.602 align:middle line:84%
Now, in 1922 there's a very --
another very interesting date.

00:23:56.602 --> 00:24:01.974 align:middle line:84%
Again, on 9/11 the British
Mandate on Palestine begins.

00:24:01.974 --> 00:24:05.410 align:middle line:90%
So now we have 2 events, 9/11,

00:24:05.410 --> 00:24:10.182 align:middle line:84%
that are reeling backwards
towards The Holy Land,

00:24:10.182 --> 00:24:15.420 align:middle line:84%
theoretically, again, the
birthplace of the life of Jesus,

00:24:15.420 --> 00:24:16.755 align:middle line:90%
Sananda, Emmanuel.

00:24:16.755 --> 00:24:21.260 align:middle line:84%
Now, let's go to
the next slide here.

00:24:21.260 --> 00:24:24.897 align:middle line:84%
This is September
11th, and it's 1941.

00:24:24.897 --> 00:24:27.199 align:middle line:84%
That's the Pentagon
in the background.

00:24:27.199 --> 00:24:30.736 align:middle line:84%
So now we have the
Pentagon, that was erected --

00:24:30.736 --> 00:24:34.540 align:middle line:84%
actually they broke ground
on September 11th, 1941.

00:24:34.540 --> 00:24:37.209 align:middle line:84%
Manhattan was theoretically
discovered

00:24:37.209 --> 00:24:40.746 align:middle line:90%
by Henry Hudson on 9/11 in 1609.

00:24:40.746 --> 00:24:43.849 align:middle line:84%
And both places played,
of course, a very key role

00:24:43.849 --> 00:24:47.553 align:middle line:84%
in what happened
on 9/11 in 2001.

00:24:49.488 --> 00:24:52.758 align:middle line:84%
Okay; here we go, this
is another key date

00:24:52.758 --> 00:24:55.928 align:middle line:84%
in the formation of the
nation state of Israel.

00:24:55.928 --> 00:24:58.730 align:middle line:84%
The man in the center,
that's Konrad Adenauer.

00:24:58.730 --> 00:25:02.534 align:middle line:84%
And he was the chancellor
of Germany, postwar Germany.

00:25:02.534 --> 00:25:06.138 align:middle line:84%
And this, I believe,
is in 1949 --

00:25:06.138 --> 00:25:09.675 align:middle line:84%
excuse me, this is
actually 1952.

00:25:09.675 --> 00:25:15.047 align:middle line:84%
And this is when Konrad Adenauer
is signing over reparations

00:25:15.047 --> 00:25:20.452 align:middle line:84%
to the Jewish people
in 1952 on 9/11.

00:25:20.452 --> 00:25:24.823 align:middle line:84%
So, again, we have this kind
of cyclical canon of events

00:25:24.823 --> 00:25:27.859 align:middle line:84%
that are moving -- because
this sets the stage here

00:25:27.859 --> 00:25:31.530 align:middle line:84%
for the formation of the nation
state of Israel getting money

00:25:31.530 --> 00:25:33.599 align:middle line:84%
from Germany, funding
a lot of it.

00:25:33.599 --> 00:25:36.668 align:middle line:84%
It's all happening
pretty much on 9/11.

00:25:36.668 --> 00:25:41.707 align:middle line:84%
Let's go to another date and
time here see what we have.

00:25:41.707 --> 00:25:42.941 align:middle line:90%
This is fascinating.

00:25:42.941 --> 00:25:48.146 align:middle line:84%
This is 9/11, 1962, very
important moment in history.

00:25:48.146 --> 00:25:51.550 align:middle line:84%
This is the first single of
the Beatles "Love Me Do,"

00:25:51.550 --> 00:25:53.952 align:middle line:84%
"P.S. I Love you"
on the flip side.

00:25:53.952 --> 00:25:57.990 align:middle line:84%
This was actually
recorded on 9/11 in 1962.

00:25:57.990 --> 00:26:02.194 align:middle line:84%
And the drummer for this was
Tony Sheridan, and he was kicked

00:26:02.194 --> 00:26:04.029 align:middle line:90%
out of the band that day,

00:26:04.029 --> 00:26:07.532 align:middle line:84%
and Ringo Starr actually
replaces him.

00:26:07.532 --> 00:26:12.137 align:middle line:84%
So this is the Beatles lineup,
and in fact this is that session

00:26:12.137 --> 00:26:14.740 align:middle line:84%
where they're recording
"Love Me Do" on 9/11,

00:26:14.740 --> 00:26:17.509 align:middle line:90%
1962 with Ringo intact.

00:26:17.509 --> 00:26:20.112 align:middle line:84%
Now, what's interesting
about the Beatles is

00:26:20.112 --> 00:26:23.048 align:middle line:84%
that the Beatles represent
group consciousness.

00:26:23.048 --> 00:26:26.018 align:middle line:84%
If you go back and you look
at who was popular prior

00:26:26.018 --> 00:26:30.689 align:middle line:84%
to the Beatles, you get people
like Bing Crosby and Perry Como,

00:26:30.689 --> 00:26:32.958 align:middle line:90%
Frank Sinatra, even Elvis.

00:26:32.958 --> 00:26:35.293 align:middle line:84%
All of these guys
were the individual.

00:26:35.293 --> 00:26:37.129 align:middle line:90%
In a lot of ways they are

00:26:37.129 --> 00:26:40.399 align:middle line:84%
in some ways representative
of the Piscean Age.

00:26:40.399 --> 00:26:44.803 align:middle line:84%
But the Beatles they are the
symbol, they are the avatars

00:26:44.803 --> 00:26:47.305 align:middle line:84%
of the Aquarian Age,
and there's a lot

00:26:47.305 --> 00:26:51.877 align:middle line:84%
of really interesting Beatle
activity that aligns itself

00:26:51.877 --> 00:26:54.579 align:middle line:84%
with 9/11, as we'll move
forward and find out

00:26:54.579 --> 00:26:56.448 align:middle line:90%
and discover together.

00:26:56.448 --> 00:27:01.053 align:middle line:84%
And here we have
-- this is 1965.

00:27:01.053 --> 00:27:04.656 align:middle line:84%
And this is the first
cavalry landing in Vietnam.

00:27:04.656 --> 00:27:09.394 align:middle line:84%
Again, this is 9/11, and in some
ways this is really the official

00:27:09.394 --> 00:27:11.630 align:middle line:90%
start date of the Vietnam War.

00:27:11.630 --> 00:27:15.600 align:middle line:84%
Once the first cavalry gets
boots on the ground in Vietnam,

00:27:15.600 --> 00:27:17.202 align:middle line:90%
that's it, it's off and running.

00:27:17.202 --> 00:27:21.339 align:middle line:84%
It's gone from being sort
of a managed conflict

00:27:21.339 --> 00:27:22.674 align:middle line:90%
or managed land -- you know,

00:27:22.674 --> 00:27:26.311 align:middle line:84%
land grab is pretty much
what it was, so a full-out,

00:27:26.311 --> 00:27:27.813 align:middle line:90%
you know, a full-on war.

00:27:27.813 --> 00:27:33.251 align:middle line:84%
So 9/11, 1965 is yet another
day in the significance of 9/11.

00:27:33.251 --> 00:27:35.287 align:middle line:84%
And it's not a great
day, by the way, either.

00:27:35.287 --> 00:27:38.657 align:middle line:84%
Now, here we have the
Beatles once again.

00:27:38.657 --> 00:27:42.194 align:middle line:84%
This is the magical
mystery tour bus.

00:27:42.194 --> 00:27:44.129 align:middle line:90%
And it cruised around London.

00:27:44.129 --> 00:27:47.632 align:middle line:84%
And what was the
day; 9/11, 1967.

00:27:47.632 --> 00:27:50.035 align:middle line:84%
And of course we have the
Beatles up here in the left,

00:27:50.035 --> 00:27:53.004 align:middle line:84%
and then some of them down
below, and there we go.

00:27:53.004 --> 00:27:55.607 align:middle line:84%
There's George down
there hiding out.

00:27:55.607 --> 00:27:59.611 align:middle line:84%
Again, another really
interesting significant moment

00:27:59.611 --> 00:28:04.216 align:middle line:84%
kind of reifying this
notion of the Aquarian Age.

00:28:04.216 --> 00:28:06.118 align:middle line:84%
Now, all these people
gathered together.

00:28:06.118 --> 00:28:08.820 align:middle line:84%
You can also see this, by
the way, on "Sgt. Pepper."

00:28:08.820 --> 00:28:11.623 align:middle line:84%
But I have an interesting
aside about the Beatles.

00:28:11.623 --> 00:28:15.894 align:middle line:84%
My first wife, her father
was a music publisher.

00:28:15.894 --> 00:28:18.964 align:middle line:84%
And he had clients
like the Mills Brothers

00:28:18.964 --> 00:28:20.599 align:middle line:84%
and Lennon Sisters,
Engelbert Humperdinck.

00:28:20.599 --> 00:28:23.635 align:middle line:84%
In fact one time he
actually gave -- his ex --

00:28:23.635 --> 00:28:26.138 align:middle line:90%
his widow, gave me a shoehorn

00:28:26.138 --> 00:28:27.739 align:middle line:84%
that was given to
him by Tom Jones.

00:28:27.739 --> 00:28:30.308 align:middle line:84%
So I had Tom Jones' shoehorn
at one point in time.

00:28:30.308 --> 00:28:32.344 align:middle line:84%
But anyway, he was
a music publisher,

00:28:32.344 --> 00:28:35.847 align:middle line:84%
and he and his family were
traveling throughout Europe.

00:28:35.847 --> 00:28:39.518 align:middle line:84%
And they were going down to the
Mediterranean to go on a cruise.

00:28:39.518 --> 00:28:42.654 align:middle line:84%
And they went through
Germany, and he went to a club,

00:28:42.654 --> 00:28:45.157 align:middle line:84%
and he saw this band, and
he really liked the band.

00:28:45.157 --> 00:28:48.627 align:middle line:84%
And he gave the manager his
card and he said, "You know,

00:28:48.627 --> 00:28:49.761 align:middle line:90%
I am in the music business.

00:28:49.761 --> 00:28:51.096 align:middle line:90%
I'm a music publisher.

00:28:51.096 --> 00:28:52.497 align:middle line:90%
I think this band has promise.

00:28:52.497 --> 00:28:56.268 align:middle line:84%
Give me a call in about 2 weeks
when I get back from vacation."

00:28:56.268 --> 00:28:57.569 align:middle line:90%
He went on the cruise.

00:28:57.569 --> 00:28:59.404 align:middle line:84%
It was -- they were
going to Greece.

00:28:59.404 --> 00:29:01.306 align:middle line:84%
And while he was on that cruises
ship he had a massive heart

00:29:01.306 --> 00:29:04.176 align:middle line:84%
attack, and had to be
airlifted off that cruise ship.

00:29:04.176 --> 00:29:06.444 align:middle line:84%
Well, the band happened
to be the Beatles.

00:29:06.444 --> 00:29:07.813 align:middle line:84%
You know where I
was going with this.

00:29:07.813 --> 00:29:09.080 align:middle line:90%
The band was the Beatles.

00:29:09.080 --> 00:29:12.551 align:middle line:84%
And who knows, I mean, had
he gotten that phone call

00:29:12.551 --> 00:29:14.719 align:middle line:84%
from Brian Epstein
2 weeks later,

00:29:14.719 --> 00:29:16.922 align:middle line:84%
history may not have
been the same,

00:29:16.922 --> 00:29:20.091 align:middle line:84%
or perhaps there was a
supernatural force operating

00:29:20.091 --> 00:29:23.261 align:middle line:84%
behind all of this,
which made sure

00:29:23.261 --> 00:29:25.597 align:middle line:84%
that he would not be
involved with the Beatles.

00:29:25.597 --> 00:29:28.133 align:middle line:84%
It's a dark thought, but
one we have to entertain.

00:29:28.133 --> 00:29:29.000 align:middle line:90%
Ah, here we go.

00:29:29.000 --> 00:29:30.869 align:middle line:90%
This is John and Yoko.

00:29:30.869 --> 00:29:36.808 align:middle line:84%
And they did not meet on 9/11,
but they met on 11/9, which is,

00:29:36.808 --> 00:29:38.677 align:middle line:90%
again, kind of fascinating.

00:29:38.677 --> 00:29:40.045 align:middle line:90%
And they met on 11/9.

00:29:40.045 --> 00:29:43.715 align:middle line:84%
Now, there's some debate in
the Beatles historical world,

00:29:43.715 --> 00:29:48.220 align:middle line:84%
was it 11/9, was it
11/8, was it 11/7?

00:29:48.220 --> 00:29:50.589 align:middle line:84%
Well, the official date
is theoretically 11/9

00:29:50.589 --> 00:29:53.124 align:middle line:84%
at the Indica Gallery
when they met.

00:29:53.124 --> 00:29:55.560 align:middle line:84%
It's a reverse of
9/11 obviously.

00:29:55.560 --> 00:29:57.028 align:middle line:84%
And look who we have
here in the background,

00:29:57.028 --> 00:29:58.496 align:middle line:90%
there's the Twin Towers.

00:29:58.496 --> 00:30:00.265 align:middle line:84%
They're actually under
construction it looks like.

00:30:00.265 --> 00:30:02.968 align:middle line:84%
I thought it was a fitting
picture to have here.

00:30:04.302 --> 00:30:06.972 align:middle line:90%
Ah, here we have Paul and Saul.

00:30:06.972 --> 00:30:09.875 align:middle line:84%
I decided to throw this
in here for a reason.

00:30:09.875 --> 00:30:13.445 align:middle line:84%
And one of the things
that comes up with 9/11,

00:30:13.445 --> 00:30:19.150 align:middle line:84%
especially if we look at
it in the context of 12/25,

00:30:19.150 --> 00:30:22.954 align:middle line:84%
that we sort of explored briefly
at the beginning of all this,

00:30:22.954 --> 00:30:24.956 align:middle line:90%
is that everything is flipped.

00:30:24.956 --> 00:30:27.759 align:middle line:84%
Everything is kind of -- I
wouldn't say it's upside down,

00:30:27.759 --> 00:30:29.628 align:middle line:90%
but it's transversed, right?

00:30:29.628 --> 00:30:34.399 align:middle line:84%
Again, on 12/25 we celebrate a
Pagan holiday and capitalism.

00:30:34.399 --> 00:30:38.803 align:middle line:84%
And on 9/11, you know, we are --
we mourn, and we have sadness,

00:30:38.803 --> 00:30:41.573 align:middle line:90%
and we solemnify that day.

00:30:41.573 --> 00:30:43.775 align:middle line:84%
So everything is
sort of transversed.

00:30:43.775 --> 00:30:45.477 align:middle line:90%
Well, this is kind

00:30:45.477 --> 00:30:49.748 align:middle line:84%
of an interesting little
transversal in and of itself.

00:30:49.748 --> 00:30:55.153 align:middle line:84%
Now, in the alternative research
world, one of the hot topics --

00:30:55.153 --> 00:30:58.723 align:middle line:84%
and it has been for a long time,
is this man, Paul McCartney,

00:30:58.723 --> 00:31:01.593 align:middle line:84%
and whether or not
this is the actual guy

00:31:01.593 --> 00:31:04.362 align:middle line:84%
that I showed you before
in that picture where all 4

00:31:04.362 --> 00:31:06.398 align:middle line:90%
of them were gathered together.

00:31:06.398 --> 00:31:10.902 align:middle line:84%
And there's a whole cult of
researchers that have done work

00:31:10.902 --> 00:31:14.673 align:middle line:84%
on what they call
"Plastic Macca," or "Faul."

00:31:14.673 --> 00:31:19.444 align:middle line:84%
It's spun off and sprang
a lot of other research

00:31:19.444 --> 00:31:23.815 align:middle line:84%
with other popular figures
of music and entertainment,

00:31:23.815 --> 00:31:27.719 align:middle line:84%
Bob Dylan, Eric Clapton,
B.B. King, to name a few.

00:31:27.719 --> 00:31:30.188 align:middle line:84%
But McCartney is
really interesting.

00:31:30.188 --> 00:31:34.726 align:middle line:84%
And the reason I have him
here with Saul and Paul is

00:31:34.726 --> 00:31:39.230 align:middle line:84%
that they represent in some
ways duality of consciousness,

00:31:39.230 --> 00:31:43.268 align:middle line:84%
and split individuality
in 2 separate identities.

00:31:43.268 --> 00:31:49.607 align:middle line:84%
So we have Paul, aka, "Faul,"
who was either Paul at one point

00:31:49.607 --> 00:31:54.045 align:middle line:84%
in time, and then died, and this
guy brought into play the role

00:31:54.045 --> 00:31:58.149 align:middle line:84%
of Paul, but nonetheless, he
is 2 separate individuals.

00:31:58.149 --> 00:32:02.587 align:middle line:84%
And here we have also another
Paul who used to be Saul.

00:32:02.587 --> 00:32:06.391 align:middle line:84%
So they kind of represent
this kind of split

00:32:06.391 --> 00:32:08.927 align:middle line:84%
in the psyche, and
this transversal.

00:32:08.927 --> 00:32:13.498 align:middle line:84%
Now, Saul/Paul has also
been called "the real Judas

00:32:13.498 --> 00:32:16.468 align:middle line:84%
of the Bible," because
he's the guy

00:32:16.468 --> 00:32:19.704 align:middle line:84%
that theoretically
commercializes

00:32:19.704 --> 00:32:22.774 align:middle line:84%
and turns Christianity
into a franchise.

00:32:22.774 --> 00:32:26.044 align:middle line:84%
And that was expressly
against the words

00:32:26.044 --> 00:32:28.179 align:middle line:90%
of Jesus, Sanat, Emmanuel.

00:32:28.179 --> 00:32:31.950 align:middle line:84%
And there is a sense with
people that are in sort

00:32:31.950 --> 00:32:33.418 align:middle line:84%
of the dark part of
the Beatle community

00:32:33.418 --> 00:32:35.587 align:middle line:90%
that he did the same thing.

00:32:35.587 --> 00:32:37.655 align:middle line:84%
So it's just kind of an
interesting juxtaposition

00:32:37.655 --> 00:32:41.426 align:middle line:84%
between the 2, and of course
the connection between Jesus,

00:32:41.426 --> 00:32:44.329 align:middle line:90%
Sanat, Emmanuel and 9/11.

00:32:44.329 --> 00:32:45.797 align:middle line:84%
And by the way, Paul
McCartney is a Gemini,

00:32:45.797 --> 00:32:47.432 align:middle line:90%
and so he represents, again,

00:32:47.432 --> 00:32:50.201 align:middle line:84%
2 levels of consciousness
and duality.

00:32:50.201 --> 00:32:51.770 align:middle line:90%
Now, here we go.

00:32:51.770 --> 00:32:55.106 align:middle line:84%
This is where, again, things
get kind of interesting.

00:32:55.106 --> 00:32:57.008 align:middle line:84%
This is the chart for
"The Summer of Love."

00:32:57.008 --> 00:32:59.010 align:middle line:90%
And I decided when I was --

00:32:59.010 --> 00:33:02.247 align:middle line:84%
when I started off on this
to move forward in time,

00:33:02.247 --> 00:33:06.251 align:middle line:84%
to see if there's any
correlation between the birth

00:33:06.251 --> 00:33:08.319 align:middle line:84%
of Jesus in that
chart, in this chart,

00:33:08.319 --> 00:33:09.521 align:middle line:90%
and sure enough there was.

00:33:09.521 --> 00:33:14.125 align:middle line:84%
Remember I told you to
remember or at least keep

00:33:14.125 --> 00:33:16.261 align:middle line:90%
in mind Pluto and Virgo?

00:33:16.261 --> 00:33:18.830 align:middle line:84%
Well, guess what, there's
Pluto and Virgo right there.

00:33:18.830 --> 00:33:25.837 align:middle line:84%
And it is at 18 degrees, just 2
degrees off of where Pluto was

00:33:25.837 --> 00:33:27.505 align:middle line:90%
at the time of Jesus' birth.

00:33:27.505 --> 00:33:31.076 align:middle line:84%
Now, what's really fascinating
is, is that when we go back

00:33:31.076 --> 00:33:34.546 align:middle line:84%
and look at that other
chart, Pluto and Uranus were

00:33:34.546 --> 00:33:36.247 align:middle line:90%
in opposition with one another.

00:33:36.247 --> 00:33:40.652 align:middle line:84%
And here we have, right
here, July 22nd, 1967,

00:33:40.652 --> 00:33:42.720 align:middle line:84%
Uranus and Pluto
have joined together.

00:33:42.720 --> 00:33:44.789 align:middle line:84%
They're both in the
sign of Virgo.

00:33:44.789 --> 00:33:48.493 align:middle line:84%
So theoretically this would
have completed that cycle

00:33:48.493 --> 00:33:49.928 align:middle line:84%
where Uranus had
gone all the way

00:33:49.928 --> 00:33:52.730 align:middle line:84%
around the chart quite a few
times, but eventually synced

00:33:52.730 --> 00:33:54.265 align:middle line:90%
up with Pluto and Virgo.

00:33:54.265 --> 00:34:00.738 align:middle line:84%
So the whole notion and idea of
waiting on this abstract moment

00:34:00.738 --> 00:34:03.942 align:middle line:84%
in space and time where you
could hear the still small

00:34:03.942 --> 00:34:06.811 align:middle line:84%
voice, where you could
theoretically, you know,

00:34:06.811 --> 00:34:09.780 align:middle line:84%
embody sort of the next
step, "Not my will,

00:34:09.780 --> 00:34:14.452 align:middle line:84%
but thine will be done,"
that has been fused together

00:34:14.452 --> 00:34:18.523 align:middle line:84%
with this Plutonian sense of
purpose, with Pluto and Virgo.

00:34:18.523 --> 00:34:19.824 align:middle line:90%
So now they're one.

00:34:19.824 --> 00:34:22.994 align:middle line:84%
I think it's a really
fascinating evolution

00:34:22.994 --> 00:34:27.999 align:middle line:84%
between what started here in
the Uranus in the 12th House

00:34:27.999 --> 00:34:30.635 align:middle line:84%
and Pluto over here in the
6th House, they come together.

00:34:30.635 --> 00:34:34.271 align:middle line:84%
Now, obviously they're over
here in the 12th House,

00:34:34.271 --> 00:34:37.142 align:middle line:84%
but I just used 11
or 11 am as the time.

00:34:37.142 --> 00:34:40.278 align:middle line:84%
If we, you know, move the chart
around a little bit, you know,

00:34:40.278 --> 00:34:43.447 align:middle line:84%
they could actually wind up in
the 1st House, and there we go.

00:34:43.447 --> 00:34:49.854 align:middle line:84%
It's the manifestation of really
what might have been the magical

00:34:49.854 --> 00:34:54.492 align:middle line:90%
template from 9/11 minus 3BC.

00:34:54.492 --> 00:34:55.994 align:middle line:84%
Now, there's some other
things happening here

00:34:55.994 --> 00:34:57.295 align:middle line:90%
that are fascinating.

00:34:57.295 --> 00:35:02.700 align:middle line:84%
What sign was Jupiter in on
that day, 9/11 minus 3BC?

00:35:02.700 --> 00:35:04.335 align:middle line:90%
It was in the sign of Leo.

00:35:04.335 --> 00:35:06.604 align:middle line:84%
And there it is again,
Jupiter and Leo showing

00:35:06.604 --> 00:35:08.540 align:middle line:90%
up in The Summer of Love.

00:35:08.540 --> 00:35:10.241 align:middle line:90%
Here it's at 11 degrees.

00:35:10.241 --> 00:35:14.512 align:middle line:84%
It's about 9 degrees forward,
but nonetheless, you know,

00:35:14.512 --> 00:35:16.514 align:middle line:84%
royalty, the sign of
the king of kings.

00:35:16.514 --> 00:35:20.585 align:middle line:84%
This, by the way, represents
in a lot of aspects the height

00:35:20.585 --> 00:35:22.854 align:middle line:84%
of the baby boomers, with
Jupiter and Leo here,

00:35:22.854 --> 00:35:25.123 align:middle line:84%
because of course they
were born Pluto and Leo,

00:35:25.123 --> 00:35:26.257 align:middle line:90%
and Jupiter was moving

00:35:26.257 --> 00:35:29.928 align:middle line:84%
across Pluto during the
entire Summer of Love.

00:35:29.928 --> 00:35:32.764 align:middle line:84%
So here we have Jupiter
and Leo, 11 degrees.

00:35:32.764 --> 00:35:35.633 align:middle line:84%
Where is it, the 11th House,
the House of Aquarius.

00:35:35.633 --> 00:35:38.536 align:middle line:84%
Well, there was another
planet hat I told you

00:35:38.536 --> 00:35:39.637 align:middle line:90%
to remember and notice.

00:35:39.637 --> 00:35:40.972 align:middle line:90%
It's right down here.

00:35:40.972 --> 00:35:44.242 align:middle line:84%
It's Neptune and Scorpio, and
there it is again, Neptune

00:35:44.242 --> 00:35:46.010 align:middle line:90%
and Scorpio, The Summer of Love.

00:35:46.010 --> 00:35:50.248 align:middle line:84%
So we have 3 planets, Pluto
and Virgo, Neptune and Scorpio,

00:35:50.248 --> 00:35:54.752 align:middle line:84%
and Jupiter and Leo that were
all present during the time

00:35:54.752 --> 00:35:56.087 align:middle line:90%
of the birth of Jesus,

00:35:56.087 --> 00:35:58.756 align:middle line:84%
and they're present
during The Summer of Love.

00:35:58.756 --> 00:36:05.163 align:middle line:84%
So it's my sense here, my
estimation that, again,

00:36:05.163 --> 00:36:09.300 align:middle line:84%
during that time what we
were supposed to be living

00:36:09.300 --> 00:36:13.571 align:middle line:84%
out was this truly
Aquarian embodiment

00:36:13.571 --> 00:36:16.908 align:middle line:84%
of the Piscean star
seed

00:36:16.908 --> 00:36:21.846 align:middle line:84%
that was planted
on 9/11 minus 3BC.

00:36:21.846 --> 00:36:27.452 align:middle line:84%
And what happened was, is
we got in some ways sort

00:36:27.452 --> 00:36:31.489 align:middle line:84%
of channeled off into
some alternate track,

00:36:31.489 --> 00:36:34.659 align:middle line:84%
and the group consciousness
was part of it.

00:36:34.659 --> 00:36:37.729 align:middle line:84%
And again, I think the Beatles
play a large role in all

00:36:37.729 --> 00:36:38.596 align:middle line:84%
of this, and not
just the Beatles,

00:36:38.596 --> 00:36:39.931 align:middle line:90%
but rock and roll in general.

00:36:39.931 --> 00:36:43.234 align:middle line:84%
But they are the avatars
of the Aquarian Age.

00:36:43.234 --> 00:36:46.170 align:middle line:84%
And really what it was about
was about each individual coming

00:36:46.170 --> 00:36:48.573 align:middle line:84%
to their own awareness
around this.

00:36:48.573 --> 00:36:51.909 align:middle line:84%
And I feel like it was
very, very close, look,

00:36:51.909 --> 00:36:56.314 align:middle line:84%
because of what happened
on 11/22, '63,

00:36:56.314 --> 00:36:57.815 align:middle line:84%
which we covered
in the last show.

00:36:57.815 --> 00:36:59.984 align:middle line:84%
We were off on a
different track.

00:36:59.984 --> 00:37:01.886 align:middle line:84%
We were off on a
different timeline.

00:37:01.886 --> 00:37:05.123 align:middle line:84%
It was all set to go off
here in The Summer of Love.

00:37:05.123 --> 00:37:07.492 align:middle line:90%
And in some ways we got a taste.

00:37:07.492 --> 00:37:08.760 align:middle line:90%
We got a little bit of a taste.

00:37:08.760 --> 00:37:10.295 align:middle line:84%
But we didn't get
the whole thing.

00:37:10.295 --> 00:37:11.796 align:middle line:90%
And it didn't last very long.

00:37:11.796 --> 00:37:14.465 align:middle line:90%
Let's go to the next slide.

00:37:14.465 --> 00:37:18.803 align:middle line:84%
So what happens is, is that
during The Summer of Love,

00:37:18.803 --> 00:37:21.272 align:middle line:84%
there was this flowering
of consciousness.

00:37:21.272 --> 00:37:23.408 align:middle line:90%
And this is from the 1970's.

00:37:23.408 --> 00:37:25.643 align:middle line:90%
This is 1971.

00:37:25.643 --> 00:37:28.780 align:middle line:84%
This is Time Magazine,
the Jesus Revolution.

00:37:28.780 --> 00:37:32.183 align:middle line:84%
And you can see during
The Summer of Love

00:37:32.183 --> 00:37:34.686 align:middle line:84%
that these seeds -- that there
were seeds that were planted,

00:37:34.686 --> 00:37:37.388 align:middle line:84%
because when we come out of The
Summer of Love, I think it was

00:37:37.388 --> 00:37:41.759 align:middle line:84%
like 1969 or so, about a year
and a half to 2 years later,

00:37:41.759 --> 00:37:45.163 align:middle line:84%
Tim Rice and Andrew
Lloyd Webber created

00:37:45.163 --> 00:37:48.933 align:middle line:84%
"Jesus Christ Superstar,"
which debuts in 1970.

00:37:48.933 --> 00:37:53.438 align:middle line:84%
And then we have the Jesus
epic directed by Zeffirelli,

00:37:53.438 --> 00:37:56.841 align:middle line:84%
starring Robert Pal,
that's 1973, "Brother Sun,

00:37:56.841 --> 00:37:58.409 align:middle line:90%
Sister Moon," "Godspell."

00:37:58.409 --> 00:38:03.214 align:middle line:84%
I mean there's a whole wave
of Jesus symbolism, and even,

00:38:03.214 --> 00:38:05.783 align:middle line:84%
you know, Jesus energy
during that time.

00:38:05.783 --> 00:38:10.822 align:middle line:84%
And one of the -- I guess he
was a lesser-known TV star,

00:38:10.822 --> 00:38:13.024 align:middle line:84%
was a guy by the name
of Marjoe Gortner,

00:38:13.024 --> 00:38:15.993 align:middle line:84%
and he had been a
revivalist preacher

00:38:15.993 --> 00:38:18.629 align:middle line:90%
and decided to be a TV star.

00:38:18.629 --> 00:38:21.065 align:middle line:84%
That was his time, that
was his period too.

00:38:21.065 --> 00:38:23.868 align:middle line:84%
So we have this consciousness
that's evolving.

00:38:23.868 --> 00:38:28.539 align:middle line:84%
And in 1973, Jupiter was
in the sign of Sagittarius,

00:38:28.539 --> 00:38:30.341 align:middle line:84%
Neptune was in the
sign of Sagittarius.

00:38:30.341 --> 00:38:33.277 align:middle line:84%
That's when all this
really, really coalesces.

00:38:33.277 --> 00:38:37.615 align:middle line:84%
But, again, it's just this --
it's a spike, it's this wave,

00:38:37.615 --> 00:38:40.184 align:middle line:84%
and then it dies
out; then it crashes.

00:38:40.184 --> 00:38:42.420 align:middle line:90%
And there's another sort of wave

00:38:42.420 --> 00:38:44.655 align:middle line:84%
of consciousness
that comes into play.

00:38:44.655 --> 00:38:46.457 align:middle line:90%
And here's Ted Neeley.

00:38:46.457 --> 00:38:48.726 align:middle line:84%
This is from "Jesus
Christ Superstar."

00:38:48.726 --> 00:38:52.830 align:middle line:84%
And, again, this imagery
and this culture was really,

00:38:52.830 --> 00:38:55.366 align:middle line:84%
really big on the backside
of The Summer of Love.

00:38:55.366 --> 00:38:56.968 align:middle line:90%
And it's kind of like we gave --

00:38:56.968 --> 00:38:59.137 align:middle line:84%
we tried to give
birth to something,

00:38:59.137 --> 00:39:01.105 align:middle line:84%
and it has this cinematic,
you know,

00:39:01.105 --> 00:39:02.974 align:middle line:90%
and archetypical expression.

00:39:02.974 --> 00:39:04.542 align:middle line:90%
And then it tails off.

00:39:04.542 --> 00:39:07.445 align:middle line:90%
And then something else occurs.

00:39:07.445 --> 00:39:09.247 align:middle line:84%
You know, that something else,
by the way, is Watergate.

00:39:09.247 --> 00:39:11.449 align:middle line:90%
And that's for a different show.

00:39:11.449 --> 00:39:14.852 align:middle line:84%
Now, another thing that's
fascinating about 9/11 is

00:39:14.852 --> 00:39:19.023 align:middle line:84%
that there are 5 really
significant nuclear tests

00:39:19.023 --> 00:39:21.192 align:middle line:90%
that take place on 9/11.

00:39:21.192 --> 00:39:23.694 align:middle line:84%
And one of them is
called "the father" --

00:39:23.694 --> 00:39:26.197 align:middle line:84%
they don't call it "the mother,"
by the way, but it's the father

00:39:26.197 --> 00:39:29.133 align:middle line:84%
of all nuclear blasts, and
it takes place in Russia.

00:39:29.133 --> 00:39:33.604 align:middle line:84%
Russia was pretty good at
exploding nuclear bombs on 9/11.

00:39:33.604 --> 00:39:36.674 align:middle line:84%
The Americans did one and
the British did one as well.

00:39:36.674 --> 00:39:37.942 align:middle line:90%
So there were 5.

00:39:37.942 --> 00:39:40.812 align:middle line:84%
Again, 5 is -- we covered
this in the last episode,

00:39:40.812 --> 00:39:45.049 align:middle line:84%
5 is the number of man, and
it also represents the star,

00:39:45.049 --> 00:39:46.684 align:middle line:90%
it represents Aquarius.

00:39:46.684 --> 00:39:50.588 align:middle line:84%
I just thought it was noteworthy
that on this day theoretically

00:39:50.588 --> 00:39:55.326 align:middle line:84%
that we would somehow possibly
celebrate the birth of Jesus,

00:39:55.326 --> 00:39:58.329 align:middle line:84%
Sanat, Emmanuel we're
exploding hell bombs.

00:39:58.329 --> 00:39:59.831 align:middle line:84%
That's what the first
bomb is called,

00:39:59.831 --> 00:40:01.632 align:middle line:90%
by the way, the hell bomb.

00:40:01.632 --> 00:40:06.838 align:middle line:84%
Okay; now here we go, this
is moving forward in time.

00:40:06.838 --> 00:40:09.974 align:middle line:84%
This is in -- well
this is Israel.

00:40:09.974 --> 00:40:11.943 align:middle line:90%
This is in 2005.

00:40:11.943 --> 00:40:14.045 align:middle line:84%
And this is when they
say, "Enough is enough.

00:40:14.045 --> 00:40:15.646 align:middle line:84%
We're going to build
this wall and we're going

00:40:15.646 --> 00:40:18.716 align:middle line:84%
to cordon ourselves
off from Palestine."

00:40:18.716 --> 00:40:24.255 align:middle line:84%
This is 2005, 9/11, and that's
the day they make this cut.

00:40:24.255 --> 00:40:27.792 align:middle line:84%
And, you know, now we have
Palestine over here, Gaza,

00:40:27.792 --> 00:40:30.027 align:middle line:90%
which is pretty much a ghetto.

00:40:30.027 --> 00:40:31.462 align:middle line:84%
And then over here
we have Jerusalem

00:40:31.462 --> 00:40:34.832 align:middle line:84%
and then moving westward
the rest of Israel.

00:40:34.832 --> 00:40:38.202 align:middle line:84%
But again, it's another event
that takes place on 9/11

00:40:38.202 --> 00:40:40.838 align:middle line:84%
that has to do with the
nation state of Israel.

00:40:40.838 --> 00:40:45.276 align:middle line:84%
It's a really interesting
coalescence of events

00:40:45.276 --> 00:40:47.044 align:middle line:84%
in their history
that relate to 9/11.

00:40:47.044 --> 00:40:51.916 align:middle line:84%
And then of course
somewhere over there is --

00:40:51.916 --> 00:40:54.752 align:middle line:84%
or over here probably, right,
would be the birth of Jesus --

00:40:54.752 --> 00:40:56.821 align:middle line:90%
the birthplace of Jesus.

00:40:56.821 --> 00:41:00.057 align:middle line:84%
Okay; so let's go
onto the next slide.

00:41:00.057 --> 00:41:02.527 align:middle line:90%
And of course here's 9/11.

00:41:02.527 --> 00:41:07.431 align:middle line:84%
This is the Twin Towers,
and a hyper-magical ritual.

00:41:07.431 --> 00:41:10.134 align:middle line:84%
And we got into that
again on the last episode

00:41:10.134 --> 00:41:11.469 align:middle line:90%
of "The Eleventh House."

00:41:11.469 --> 00:41:16.607 align:middle line:84%
And really what this is, is
it's the collapse of duality

00:41:16.607 --> 00:41:20.578 align:middle line:84%
and it represents Gemini
and all the other, you know,

00:41:20.578 --> 00:41:24.215 align:middle line:84%
timeline markers that we
talked about in the last show.

00:41:24.215 --> 00:41:27.818 align:middle line:84%
But also out of this is going to
be the One World Trade Center,

00:41:27.818 --> 00:41:32.590 align:middle line:84%
which is sort of the monolithic
phallic Tower of Babel

00:41:32.590 --> 00:41:36.194 align:middle line:84%
that will be a tribute
to humanity.

00:41:36.194 --> 00:41:38.763 align:middle line:84%
In a lot of ways it's a
magician's wand, right,

00:41:38.763 --> 00:41:45.236 align:middle line:84%
poking up in the air and
bringing down the idea space

00:41:45.236 --> 00:41:50.341 align:middle line:84%
from the heavens down into
the structure of the earth.

00:41:50.341 --> 00:41:54.378 align:middle line:84%
But that's what's
replacing these 2 towers,

00:41:54.378 --> 00:41:57.782 align:middle line:90%
but 9/11, again, that day.

00:41:57.782 --> 00:41:59.984 align:middle line:90%
This is Bashar al-Assad.

00:41:59.984 --> 00:42:03.087 align:middle line:84%
He's also born on 9/11,
which is fascinating.

00:42:03.087 --> 00:42:08.726 align:middle line:84%
And just prior to 9/11 this
last year there was a lot

00:42:08.726 --> 00:42:12.730 align:middle line:84%
of action centered
around this guy and Syria.

00:42:12.730 --> 00:42:15.099 align:middle line:84%
And just think back, it
was about 2-1/2 months ago

00:42:15.099 --> 00:42:17.335 align:middle line:90%
where there was a call to war.

00:42:17.335 --> 00:42:20.972 align:middle line:84%
I mean, we were going to go to
war in Syria, and we were going

00:42:20.972 --> 00:42:26.010 align:middle line:84%
to go to war against
this guy born on 9/11.

00:42:26.010 --> 00:42:28.679 align:middle line:84%
Now, one of the things
that we look at with some

00:42:28.679 --> 00:42:32.183 align:middle line:84%
of these interesting events
is what I would call --

00:42:32.183 --> 00:42:36.320 align:middle line:84%
they're not really time
markers, but they're anomalies

00:42:36.320 --> 00:42:37.989 align:middle line:90%
that you need to look at.

00:42:37.989 --> 00:42:40.191 align:middle line:84%
It's kind of like
when you, you know,

00:42:40.191 --> 00:42:41.559 align:middle line:90%
watch the movie "The Matrix"

00:42:41.559 --> 00:42:45.329 align:middle line:84%
and there are these really
interesting dÃ©jÃ  vu's, right,

00:42:45.329 --> 00:42:47.431 align:middle line:90%
I mean, these burps in time.

00:42:47.431 --> 00:42:50.568 align:middle line:84%
And I found 2 burps
in time around 9/11

00:42:50.568 --> 00:42:52.403 align:middle line:90%
that I thought were fascinating.

00:42:52.403 --> 00:42:56.641 align:middle line:84%
This is Ty Cobb on the right,
and on the left is Pete Rose.

00:42:56.641 --> 00:43:02.179 align:middle line:84%
And Ty Cobb actually had
his very last at bats

00:43:02.179 --> 00:43:05.816 align:middle line:90%
as a major leaguer on 9/11.

00:43:05.816 --> 00:43:11.589 align:middle line:84%
And Pete Rose broke Ty
Cobb's hit record on 9/11.

00:43:11.589 --> 00:43:15.159 align:middle line:84%
And so when I find these
correspondences in time

00:43:15.159 --> 00:43:16.894 align:middle line:84%
like that, I say, "Wow,
this is interesting.

00:43:16.894 --> 00:43:18.262 align:middle line:90%
We have to look at this,"

00:43:18.262 --> 00:43:21.666 align:middle line:84%
because there's a cyclical
event taking place.

00:43:21.666 --> 00:43:25.503 align:middle line:84%
There's something about this
time loop that's represented

00:43:25.503 --> 00:43:28.873 align:middle line:84%
by these 2 seemingly
disconnected and

00:43:28.873 --> 00:43:31.642 align:middle line:90%
yet synchronous events in time.

00:43:31.642 --> 00:43:34.211 align:middle line:84%
There's another one that I
thought was really fascinating.

00:43:34.211 --> 00:43:38.983 align:middle line:84%
Now, the above, this is Jenny
Lind, and she was called

00:43:38.983 --> 00:43:41.052 align:middle line:90%
"the Swedish Nightingale."

00:43:41.052 --> 00:43:45.322 align:middle line:84%
And she made her American
debut as a singer --

00:43:45.322 --> 00:43:48.025 align:middle line:84%
she was an opera singer,
she made her American debut

00:43:48.025 --> 00:43:52.096 align:middle line:90%
on 9/11 in 1850, okay?

00:43:52.096 --> 00:43:58.135 align:middle line:84%
And below her is Anna Lindh
L I N D H, Anna Lindh.

00:43:58.135 --> 00:44:01.372 align:middle line:84%
And Anna Lindh was the
prime minister of --

00:44:01.372 --> 00:44:05.676 align:middle line:90%
where -- this was in 2011.

00:44:05.676 --> 00:44:08.145 align:middle line:84%
She was the prime
minister of Sweden.

00:44:08.145 --> 00:44:11.215 align:middle line:84%
So we have Jenny Lind,
L I N D, Anna Lindh,

00:44:11.215 --> 00:44:19.123 align:middle line:84%
L I N D H. She makes her
American debut on 9/11 in 1850,

00:44:19.123 --> 00:44:21.759 align:middle line:90%
and she's murdered on 9/11,

00:44:21.759 --> 00:44:26.397 align:middle line:84%
and I believe it's
2011 she murdered.

00:44:26.397 --> 00:44:28.466 align:middle line:84%
And her death is
really mysterious.

00:44:28.466 --> 00:44:32.403 align:middle line:84%
They actually had 2 people
that they had arrested,

00:44:32.403 --> 00:44:33.804 align:middle line:90%
and let both of them go.

00:44:33.804 --> 00:44:36.006 align:middle line:84%
And then they found the
3rd guy, arrested him,

00:44:36.006 --> 00:44:39.910 align:middle line:84%
and he had really -- he
really didn't have much

00:44:39.910 --> 00:44:41.645 align:middle line:90%
of a story except, "I did it."

00:44:41.645 --> 00:44:43.047 align:middle line:90%
And that was really about it.

00:44:43.047 --> 00:44:45.416 align:middle line:84%
I mean, he seemed for
all intents and purposes

00:44:45.416 --> 00:44:47.885 align:middle line:84%
like he might have been
a mind control patsy.

00:44:47.885 --> 00:44:50.221 align:middle line:84%
But, again, I thought that
this was really interesting

00:44:50.221 --> 00:44:53.591 align:middle line:84%
that the 2 Lind's would show up,
that they would both be Swedish,

00:44:53.591 --> 00:44:56.427 align:middle line:84%
and they would both
have memorable moments,

00:44:56.427 --> 00:44:58.262 align:middle line:84%
the American debut
and her death.

00:44:58.262 --> 00:45:01.999 align:middle line:84%
By the way, she was a very
outspoken critic of Israel,

00:45:01.999 --> 00:45:03.901 align:middle line:90%
and was really, you know,

00:45:03.901 --> 00:45:06.871 align:middle line:84%
trying to put a 2-state
solution together.

00:45:06.871 --> 00:45:09.707 align:middle line:84%
She was also rumored
to be head of --

00:45:09.707 --> 00:45:11.442 align:middle line:90%
or they were going to think

00:45:11.442 --> 00:45:13.177 align:middle line:84%
about putting her
in head of the EU.

00:45:13.177 --> 00:45:16.413 align:middle line:84%
So she was going to be an
incredibly powerful woman,

00:45:16.413 --> 00:45:19.683 align:middle line:84%
and she died of a knife
wound to the stomach.

00:45:19.683 --> 00:45:21.786 align:middle line:84%
So when you see these
events, these mirror events

00:45:21.786 --> 00:45:24.855 align:middle line:84%
through time, at least
I think, you know,

00:45:24.855 --> 00:45:29.560 align:middle line:84%
it's a really interesting
sequence to focus on,

00:45:29.560 --> 00:45:33.297 align:middle line:84%
especially when we look
at something like 9/11

00:45:33.297 --> 00:45:35.433 align:middle line:84%
as a recurring event
through time.

00:45:35.433 --> 00:45:39.003 align:middle line:90%
[ Silence ]

00:45:39.003 --> 00:45:41.872 align:middle line:84%
So that brings us really to
the end of the slide show

00:45:41.872 --> 00:45:43.841 align:middle line:90%
and to the end of the show.

00:45:43.841 --> 00:45:48.078 align:middle line:84%
And what I tried to do today
was to get you to wrap your head

00:45:48.078 --> 00:45:51.982 align:middle line:84%
around possibility; the
possibility that the type

00:45:51.982 --> 00:45:53.818 align:middle line:90%
of celebration that you --

00:45:53.818 --> 00:45:56.520 align:middle line:84%
most of us have been
mindlessly participating

00:45:56.520 --> 00:46:00.257 align:middle line:84%
in for the majority of our
lives, may not be the right day,

00:46:00.257 --> 00:46:03.561 align:middle line:84%
and the right day may be the
day that we're actually thinking

00:46:03.561 --> 00:46:06.797 align:middle line:84%
about the horror, and the
tragedy, and the sadness,

00:46:06.797 --> 00:46:10.901 align:middle line:84%
and the collapse in some
ways of the American dream,

00:46:10.901 --> 00:46:12.503 align:middle line:84%
and turn it into the
American nightmare.

00:46:12.503 --> 00:46:15.773 align:middle line:84%
And oh by the way, the 9/11
event is really the birth

00:46:15.773 --> 00:46:18.209 align:middle line:84%
of the -- not the
birth, but it was the --

00:46:18.209 --> 00:46:20.644 align:middle line:90%
I would say the re-consecration,

00:46:20.644 --> 00:46:22.012 align:middle line:84%
in some ways, of
the false Aquarian Age.

00:46:22.012 --> 00:46:25.549 align:middle line:84%
So we tried to get you to wrap
your head around that today,

00:46:25.549 --> 00:46:30.521 align:middle line:84%
and to look at the sequence
of events through time to see

00:46:30.521 --> 00:46:32.122 align:middle line:90%
that there are correspondences,

00:46:32.122 --> 00:46:35.726 align:middle line:84%
not just with the birth chart
itself, but with also the chart

00:46:35.726 --> 00:46:39.463 align:middle line:84%
with The Summer of Love in 1967,
and all these other events,

00:46:39.463 --> 00:46:44.802 align:middle line:84%
which seem to desecrate and
denigrate that day, 9/11.

00:46:44.802 --> 00:46:48.005 align:middle line:84%
It's anything but a
day of celebration.

00:46:48.005 --> 00:46:51.876 align:middle line:84%
It's really a day where we
commemorate not just what

00:46:51.876 --> 00:46:56.847 align:middle line:84%
happened on 9/11 in 2001, but a
number of other events as well.

00:46:56.847 --> 00:47:00.451 align:middle line:84%
So that's it, this was this
edition of "The Eleventh House."

get into Pluto and Capricorn,

00:47:06.590 --> 00:47:09.059 align:middle line:84%
and what we're experiencing
right now as a result

00:47:09.059 --> 00:47:10.427 align:middle line:90%
of Pluto and Capricorn.

00:47:10.427 --> 00:47:14.498 align:middle line:84%
But until then, take care of
yourself, and be sure to share

00:47:14.498 --> 00:47:17.167 align:middle line:84%
"The Eleventh House" with
