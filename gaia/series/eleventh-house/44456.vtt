00:00:16.852 --> 00:00:19.060 align:middle line:84%
>> ROBERT PHOENIX: Welcome
to another edition of "The

00:00:19.060 --> 00:00:19.750 align:middle line:90%
Eleventh House."

00:00:19.750 --> 00:00:22.990 align:middle line:84%
I am Robert Phoenix, and I'm
channeling the divine harmony

00:00:22.990 --> 00:00:25.720 align:middle line:84%
of the Libra moon today,
since the moon is in Libra.

00:00:25.720 --> 00:00:27.790 align:middle line:84%
And I promise you
I will give you

00:00:27.790 --> 00:00:30.590 align:middle line:84%
a fair and balanced
representation of what

00:00:30.590 --> 00:00:31.980 align:middle line:90%
I'm about to share with you.

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:36.030 align:middle line:84%
And what I'm about to share
with you is in my estimation

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:39.140 align:middle line:84%
the blueprint for the latter
part of the 20th century.

00:00:39.140 --> 00:00:40.580 align:middle line:84%
It is the magical
blueprint and in

00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:42.830 align:middle line:84%
some ways a very dark
magical blueprint.

00:00:42.830 --> 00:00:45.571 align:middle line:84%
And it's called the
Babalon Working.

00:00:45.571 --> 00:00:47.320 align:middle line:84%
Now, the Babalon
Working, for those of you

00:00:47.320 --> 00:00:50.880 align:middle line:84%
who are familiar with Aleister
Crowley and the occult,

00:00:50.880 --> 00:00:54.480 align:middle line:84%
this is one of the more
well-known magical rituals

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:56.430 align:middle line:90%
of the 20th century.

00:00:56.430 --> 00:00:58.040 align:middle line:84%
And we're going to
look at that today

00:00:58.040 --> 00:01:01.881 align:middle line:84%
from an astrological perspective
and from a cultural perspective

00:01:01.881 --> 00:01:02.380 align:middle line:90%
as well.

00:01:02.380 --> 00:01:05.730 align:middle line:84%
Now keep in mind this show
is going to be in two parts.

00:01:05.730 --> 00:01:07.980 align:middle line:84%
And the second
part of the show is

00:01:07.980 --> 00:01:11.990 align:middle line:84%
where we're really going to get
into how this has manifested

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:15.430 align:middle line:84%
culturally and some of the
implications of the Babalon

00:01:15.430 --> 00:01:17.190 align:middle line:90%
Working moving forward.

00:01:17.190 --> 00:01:19.690 align:middle line:84%
So let's just talk about
the players for a moment.

00:01:19.690 --> 00:01:23.990 align:middle line:84%
Here we have Marvel
Whiteside Parsons, also known

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:27.240 align:middle line:84%
as Jack Parsons, the son of
a wealthy Southern California

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:30.010 align:middle line:84%
family who liked to explode
things when he was a kid.

00:01:30.010 --> 00:01:33.030 align:middle line:84%
And earlier today Jay
Weidner shared with me

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:36.180 align:middle line:84%
an interesting fact that they
decided to send him to France

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:37.890 align:middle line:84%
to study explosives,
and he thinks

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:40.090 align:middle line:90%
with the alchemist Fulcanelli.

00:01:40.090 --> 00:01:44.150 align:middle line:84%
Well, Jack Parsons
eventually joins the Navy,

00:01:44.150 --> 00:01:47.600 align:middle line:84%
because he's got a military
mind, a technological mind.

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:51.210 align:middle line:84%
And he's also deeply
involved in the OTO

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:55.640 align:middle line:84%
and is slated to be the man, the
head of the OTO in the United

00:01:55.640 --> 00:01:57.500 align:middle line:90%
States by one Aleister Crowley.

00:01:57.500 --> 00:02:00.550 align:middle line:84%
And in the Navy he
meets this fellow.

00:02:00.550 --> 00:02:03.400 align:middle line:84%
Yes, that's L. Ron Hubbard,
who will eventually

00:02:03.400 --> 00:02:05.170 align:middle line:90%
found Scientology.

00:02:05.170 --> 00:02:09.350 align:middle line:84%
Now L. Ron Hubbard was working
Naval Intelligence at the time.

00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:12.060 align:middle line:84%
And the Navy thought
that Jack Parsons really

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:16.306 align:middle line:84%
needed to be followed, and he
needed to hang out with him

00:02:16.306 --> 00:02:18.680 align:middle line:84%
and defriend him-- befriend
him rather, not defriend him.

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:22.310 align:middle line:84%
You do that on Facebook--
befriend him and try

00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:24.890 align:middle line:84%
to figure out what Jack
Parsons was all about.

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:26.727 align:middle line:84%
But L. Ron Hubbard,
he crossed the line.

00:02:26.727 --> 00:02:27.310 align:middle line:90%
He went rogue.

00:02:27.310 --> 00:02:32.110 align:middle line:84%
He got very interested
in Jack Parsons and magic

00:02:32.110 --> 00:02:36.266 align:middle line:84%
and the occult and especially
Jack Parsons' wife Marjorie

00:02:36.266 --> 00:02:36.765 align:middle line:90%
Cameron.

00:02:36.765 --> 00:02:38.990 align:middle line:84%
We're going to talk about
them in just a second.

00:02:38.990 --> 00:02:40.870 align:middle line:84%
There's a little
side story here.

00:02:40.870 --> 00:02:43.060 align:middle line:84%
Apparently L. Ron
Hubbard had a bet

00:02:43.060 --> 00:02:45.510 align:middle line:84%
going on with Robert
Heinlein, both of whom

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:47.160 align:middle line:90%
became science fiction writers.

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:49.620 align:middle line:84%
And the bet was who could
start their own religion first,

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:50.880 align:middle line:90%
believe it or not.

00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:53.510 align:middle line:84%
And I think Hubbard beat
Heinlein to the punch.

00:02:53.510 --> 00:02:55.120 align:middle line:84%
Although Heinlein
write a better book

00:02:55.120 --> 00:02:57.080 align:middle line:84%
with "Stranger in
a Strange Land."

00:02:57.080 --> 00:02:59.860 align:middle line:84%
But L. Ron Hubbard becomes
friends with Jack Parsons,

00:02:59.860 --> 00:03:04.490 align:middle line:84%
and together they form a
trinity with Marjorie Cameron.

00:03:04.490 --> 00:03:09.410 align:middle line:84%
Now, Marjorie Cameron
is supposedly related

00:03:09.410 --> 00:03:13.020 align:middle line:84%
to the Cameron-Wilson
clan, which

00:03:13.020 --> 00:03:16.430 align:middle line:84%
shows up in the
Chronicles of Montauk.

00:03:16.430 --> 00:03:18.370 align:middle line:84%
Now we're going
to talk about that

00:03:18.370 --> 00:03:20.590 align:middle line:90%
in the second part of this show.

00:03:20.590 --> 00:03:23.960 align:middle line:84%
It's a very interesting
sort of detour

00:03:23.960 --> 00:03:27.460 align:middle line:84%
that also includes Pete Carroll,
the coach of the Seattle

00:03:27.460 --> 00:03:31.100 align:middle line:84%
Seahawks, and one quarterback
from the Seattle Seahawks

00:03:31.100 --> 00:03:33.612 align:middle line:84%
and Super Bowl XLVIII as well
as Philip Seymour Hoffman.

00:03:33.612 --> 00:03:34.820 align:middle line:90%
That's in episode number two.

00:03:34.820 --> 00:03:36.110 align:middle line:90%
That's called a tease.

00:03:36.110 --> 00:03:36.640 align:middle line:90%
Here we go.

00:03:36.640 --> 00:03:38.931 align:middle line:84%
This is Marjorie Cameron, L.
Ron Hubbard, Jack Parsons.

00:03:38.931 --> 00:03:42.250 align:middle line:84%
They form a trinity,
and together they

00:03:42.250 --> 00:03:45.260 align:middle line:84%
perform the Babalon
Working, a series

00:03:45.260 --> 00:03:47.380 align:middle line:90%
of rituals over three months.

00:03:47.380 --> 00:03:49.380 align:middle line:84%
And essentially
what they're doing

00:03:49.380 --> 00:03:54.250 align:middle line:84%
is they're using Crowley-esque
sex magic techniques where

00:03:54.250 --> 00:04:01.520 align:middle line:84%
they are in a magical
object or a magical diagram,

00:04:01.520 --> 00:04:04.220 align:middle line:90%
a magical geometrical shape.

00:04:04.220 --> 00:04:06.840 align:middle line:84%
We're going to look
at that later on.

00:04:06.840 --> 00:04:10.840 align:middle line:84%
So they're in that
magical square or circle.

00:04:10.840 --> 00:04:13.179 align:middle line:90%
It's actually a circle.

00:04:13.179 --> 00:04:15.220 align:middle line:84%
And while they're in there,
what they're doing is

00:04:15.220 --> 00:04:17.480 align:middle line:84%
they're staying up for
long periods of time,

00:04:17.480 --> 00:04:19.970 align:middle line:84%
and they're doing
incantations, and they're

00:04:19.970 --> 00:04:25.270 align:middle line:84%
trying to get Marjorie Cameron
into a hypnagogic state that

00:04:25.270 --> 00:04:28.190 align:middle line:84%
is slightly ecstatic for
long periods of time.

00:04:28.190 --> 00:04:31.790 align:middle line:84%
So they are literally kind of
trading off energies with her.

00:04:31.790 --> 00:04:35.680 align:middle line:84%
And the whole idea here
is for Marjorie Cameron

00:04:35.680 --> 00:04:39.650 align:middle line:84%
to bring a moonlet
into the 20th century.

00:04:39.650 --> 00:04:41.570 align:middle line:90%
The moonlet is a being.

00:04:41.570 --> 00:04:43.190 align:middle line:90%
It is an interdimensional being.

00:04:43.190 --> 00:04:44.820 align:middle line:84%
And this interdimensional
being would

00:04:44.820 --> 00:04:49.120 align:middle line:84%
be the reincarnation
of the Great Goddess.

00:04:49.120 --> 00:04:51.260 align:middle line:84%
And the reason why
they wanted to do this

00:04:51.260 --> 00:04:54.934 align:middle line:84%
was because they believed
that the patriarchy was

00:04:54.934 --> 00:04:56.350 align:middle line:84%
running roughshod
over the planet.

00:04:56.350 --> 00:04:58.070 align:middle line:90%
It was creating war.

00:04:58.070 --> 00:04:59.225 align:middle line:90%
It was creating crime.

00:04:59.225 --> 00:05:02.411 align:middle line:84%
It was creating most of the
problems of the 20th century

00:05:02.411 --> 00:05:04.285 align:middle line:84%
that we're dealing with
and had been doing it

00:05:04.285 --> 00:05:05.400 align:middle line:90%
for quite a long time.

00:05:05.400 --> 00:05:08.476 align:middle line:84%
So it was about the reemergence
or the reintroduction

00:05:08.476 --> 00:05:09.350 align:middle line:90%
of the Great Goddess.

00:05:09.350 --> 00:05:11.980 align:middle line:84%
Well, my sense is
is that they did it.

00:05:11.980 --> 00:05:15.050 align:middle line:84%
And we're going to look at
some of that-- not all of it,

00:05:15.050 --> 00:05:18.220 align:middle line:84%
but some of it-- in this
episode and a lot more

00:05:18.220 --> 00:05:20.320 align:middle line:90%
in episode number two.

00:05:20.320 --> 00:05:21.490 align:middle line:90%
Now eventually L Ron.

00:05:21.490 --> 00:05:23.730 align:middle line:84%
Hubbard runs off with
Marjorie Cameron,

00:05:23.730 --> 00:05:27.580 align:middle line:84%
and then Jack Parsons dies
in a very mysterious chemical

00:05:27.580 --> 00:05:29.420 align:middle line:90%
fire at JPL Laboratories.

00:05:29.420 --> 00:05:31.790 align:middle line:84%
But Jack Parsons becomes
a rocket scientist.

00:05:31.790 --> 00:05:33.245 align:middle line:84%
And not just any
rocket scientist.

00:05:33.245 --> 00:05:35.950 align:middle line:90%


00:05:35.950 --> 00:05:39.750 align:middle line:84%
His innovations
with solid fuels,

00:05:39.750 --> 00:05:44.150 align:middle line:84%
they create the modern
space program as we know it.

00:05:44.150 --> 00:05:46.560 align:middle line:84%
He comes up with a
special compound that

00:05:46.560 --> 00:05:49.510 align:middle line:84%
allows solids to be
introduced into liquids,

00:05:49.510 --> 00:05:53.640 align:middle line:84%
and those solids take the
rocket propulsion systems

00:05:53.640 --> 00:05:56.890 align:middle line:84%
of the Saturn V rocket,
the most famous rocket,

00:05:56.890 --> 00:06:00.650 align:middle line:84%
into the 20th century and
theoretically to the moon

00:06:00.650 --> 00:06:02.070 align:middle line:90%
and perhaps even beyond.

00:06:02.070 --> 00:06:05.560 align:middle line:84%
Now there is a story that Jack
Parsons used to take and draw

00:06:05.560 --> 00:06:09.520 align:middle line:84%
these satanic kind of
epigrammatic diagrams

00:06:09.520 --> 00:06:13.080 align:middle line:84%
and symbols inside the
boosters of these rockets

00:06:13.080 --> 00:06:15.360 align:middle line:84%
just so they could
fly higher or travel

00:06:15.360 --> 00:06:16.890 align:middle line:84%
with the fury and
the speed of hell.

00:06:16.890 --> 00:06:18.219 align:middle line:90%
Anyway, this his is chart.

00:06:18.219 --> 00:06:19.260 align:middle line:90%
Let's look at it briefly.

00:06:19.260 --> 00:06:22.240 align:middle line:84%
Of course he's got
Gemini on the ascendant.

00:06:22.240 --> 00:06:26.520 align:middle line:84%
This would be, I think, part
and parcel of a Jack Parsons

00:06:26.520 --> 00:06:28.910 align:middle line:84%
kind of personality
in a lot of ways.

00:06:28.910 --> 00:06:35.220 align:middle line:84%
And we also have up here
Jupiter and Uranus in Aquarius.

00:06:35.220 --> 00:06:38.330 align:middle line:84%
He was born, I
believe, on October 2.

00:06:38.330 --> 00:06:41.600 align:middle line:84%
In the Midheaven is
Aquarius, so he's really

00:06:41.600 --> 00:06:46.280 align:middle line:84%
invested in this movement
towards kind of a more Aquarian

00:06:46.280 --> 00:06:49.560 align:middle line:84%
world, which we find
a lot of people that

00:06:49.560 --> 00:06:52.606 align:middle line:84%
are social revolutionaries or
radicals of one shape or form

00:06:52.606 --> 00:06:54.030 align:middle line:90%
another are.

00:06:54.030 --> 00:06:57.820 align:middle line:84%
We have Sun down here in Libra,
and it's trining Jupiter,

00:06:57.820 --> 00:06:59.660 align:middle line:90%
and it's trining Uranus.

00:06:59.660 --> 00:07:01.165 align:middle line:84%
And so what he's
doing with the Sun

00:07:01.165 --> 00:07:02.790 align:middle line:84%
in Libra in the fifth
house, especially

00:07:02.790 --> 00:07:05.420 align:middle line:84%
with the trines to
Aquarius-- fifth house

00:07:05.420 --> 00:07:09.000 align:middle line:84%
is the house of romance and
heart and creativity, Libra

00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:13.550 align:middle line:84%
the sign of relationships--
he's forming unusual alliances,

00:07:13.550 --> 00:07:14.070 align:middle line:90%
right?

00:07:14.070 --> 00:07:15.650 align:middle line:90%
He's forming unusual alliances.

00:07:15.650 --> 00:07:16.625 align:middle line:90%
Uranus is strange.

00:07:16.625 --> 00:07:18.610 align:middle line:90%
It's different.

00:07:18.610 --> 00:07:21.830 align:middle line:84%
It's bringing a different
angle to his solar energy.

00:07:21.830 --> 00:07:25.900 align:middle line:84%
He was OK with this, I
think, to a large degree.

00:07:25.900 --> 00:07:26.630 align:middle line:90%
Why?

00:07:26.630 --> 00:07:31.360 align:middle line:84%
For the creation or the
propulsion of the Aquarian

00:07:31.360 --> 00:07:33.379 align:middle line:84%
dream, or his version
of the Aquarian dream.

00:07:33.379 --> 00:07:35.170 align:middle line:84%
Now what's also
interesting about his chart

00:07:35.170 --> 00:07:39.050 align:middle line:84%
is he's got a great
grand trine in water.

00:07:39.050 --> 00:07:41.910 align:middle line:84%
He's got Moon at the
end here in Pisces.

00:07:41.910 --> 00:07:44.887 align:middle line:84%
And then he's got Neptune,
which is out of sign

00:07:44.887 --> 00:07:46.720 align:middle line:84%
trine because it's in
Leo, but still there's

00:07:46.720 --> 00:07:50.450 align:middle line:84%
the water aspect to it,
and then Venus in Scorpio.

00:07:50.450 --> 00:07:53.960 align:middle line:84%
And we see Venus in Scorpio
in the trinity between him

00:07:53.960 --> 00:07:57.330 align:middle line:84%
and Hubbard and
Marjorie Cameron.

00:07:57.330 --> 00:08:00.929 align:middle line:84%
And it's in the sixth house,
so I believe that he saw this--

00:08:00.929 --> 00:08:02.220 align:middle line:90%
And there's the moonlet, right?

00:08:02.220 --> 00:08:03.280 align:middle line:90%
There's the moonlet.

00:08:03.280 --> 00:08:08.750 align:middle line:84%
There's Neptune, which is
intoxication, inebriation,

00:08:08.750 --> 00:08:10.354 align:middle line:90%
seduction.

00:08:10.354 --> 00:08:10.895 align:middle line:90%
It's trining.

00:08:10.895 --> 00:08:12.620 align:middle line:90%
It's trining it in Leo.

00:08:12.620 --> 00:08:17.300 align:middle line:84%
And we see here the trinity
between possibly Cameron--

00:08:17.300 --> 00:08:19.310 align:middle line:84%
and the Moon in
Pisces, by the way,

00:08:19.310 --> 00:08:22.160 align:middle line:84%
would be Hubbard, because L. Ron
Hubbard is a Pisces-- Marjorie

00:08:22.160 --> 00:08:24.430 align:middle line:90%
Cameron and Jack Parsons.

00:08:24.430 --> 00:08:28.830 align:middle line:84%
There's the trinity, Venus in
Scorpio in service of a work,

00:08:28.830 --> 00:08:31.200 align:middle line:84%
the sixth house, the
perfection of a work.

00:08:31.200 --> 00:08:35.630 align:middle line:84%
We also see here the T-square,
with Mercury and Mars squaring

00:08:35.630 --> 00:08:39.350 align:middle line:84%
off against Uranus and Jupiter
and Neptune intoxication

00:08:39.350 --> 00:08:40.870 align:middle line:90%
with drugs.

00:08:40.870 --> 00:08:43.780 align:middle line:84%
Jack Parsons might have had
some anger issues as well.

00:08:43.780 --> 00:08:47.480 align:middle line:84%
So he's got this strong trine
with two planets of water

00:08:47.480 --> 00:08:51.230 align:middle line:84%
and out of sign trine
with Neptune in Leo.

00:08:51.230 --> 00:08:55.200 align:middle line:84%
And then we have the T-square,
which provides in a lot of ways

00:08:55.200 --> 00:08:57.570 align:middle line:90%
the combustion to the chart.

00:08:57.570 --> 00:08:58.530 align:middle line:90%
He's a rebel.

00:08:58.530 --> 00:09:00.810 align:middle line:84%
He's got Uranus squaring
his Mercury, Uranus

00:09:00.810 --> 00:09:02.340 align:middle line:90%
squaring his Mars.

00:09:02.340 --> 00:09:04.040 align:middle line:90%
That's a rebellious aspect.

00:09:04.040 --> 00:09:08.900 align:middle line:84%
And he's also, in some
ways-- this is interesting,

00:09:08.900 --> 00:09:10.370 align:middle line:84%
because now we're
getting into how

00:09:10.370 --> 00:09:12.860 align:middle line:90%
he decodes mystical information.

00:09:12.860 --> 00:09:15.160 align:middle line:84%
And with this
square to Neptune, I

00:09:15.160 --> 00:09:18.615 align:middle line:84%
would think that Jack Parsons
could not trust everything

00:09:18.615 --> 00:09:21.150 align:middle line:84%
that he believed or everything
he might have received

00:09:21.150 --> 00:09:23.600 align:middle line:84%
with this square from
Mercury to Neptune.

00:09:23.600 --> 00:09:26.600 align:middle line:84%
He'd have to double-check
and verify his sources.

00:09:26.600 --> 00:09:29.330 align:middle line:84%
And then we have
the square to Pluto.

00:09:29.330 --> 00:09:30.890 align:middle line:84%
The Pluto-Moon square
is interesting,

00:09:30.890 --> 00:09:31.848 align:middle line:90%
because it's intensity.

00:09:31.848 --> 00:09:32.940 align:middle line:90%
It's emotion.

00:09:32.940 --> 00:09:34.620 align:middle line:84%
And people that have
Pluto-Moon squares

00:09:34.620 --> 00:09:37.180 align:middle line:84%
are not afraid of intense
emotional encounters.

00:09:37.180 --> 00:09:40.370 align:middle line:84%
And apparently what happened
during the Babalon Working

00:09:40.370 --> 00:09:43.850 align:middle line:84%
is that over a period of months,
L. Ron Hubbard eventually

00:09:43.850 --> 00:09:46.400 align:middle line:84%
received the entire
download of "Dianetics."

00:09:46.400 --> 00:09:48.670 align:middle line:84%
Let's take a look at
Hubbard's chart here.

00:09:48.670 --> 00:09:49.820 align:middle line:90%
It's a fascinating chart.

00:09:49.820 --> 00:09:51.690 align:middle line:84%
It almost looks like
a Star of David.

00:09:51.690 --> 00:09:52.730 align:middle line:90%
But what do we see?

00:09:52.730 --> 00:09:55.040 align:middle line:90%
We see again the trine.

00:09:55.040 --> 00:09:59.040 align:middle line:84%
We have Jupiter in
Scorpio, Neptune in Cancer.

00:09:59.040 --> 00:10:01.626 align:middle line:84%
This is a true water trine,
a true Grand Water Trine.

00:10:01.626 --> 00:10:02.500 align:middle line:90%
So we have the trine.

00:10:02.500 --> 00:10:03.520 align:middle line:84%
It's headed in a
different direction.

00:10:03.520 --> 00:10:04.370 align:middle line:90%
It's headed down.

00:10:04.370 --> 00:10:06.400 align:middle line:84%
It's headed down
into the third house.

00:10:06.400 --> 00:10:09.530 align:middle line:84%
And we have the
T-square, again almost

00:10:09.530 --> 00:10:12.620 align:middle line:84%
in exactly the same
place as Jack Parsons.

00:10:12.620 --> 00:10:14.710 align:middle line:84%
Parsons' was a little bit
further up here, well,

00:10:14.710 --> 00:10:16.710 align:middle line:84%
much further up into
the ninth house.

00:10:16.710 --> 00:10:20.010 align:middle line:84%
And then on the
Midheaven is Libra,

00:10:20.010 --> 00:10:22.080 align:middle line:84%
and that's where
Jack Parsons' Sun is.

00:10:22.080 --> 00:10:24.170 align:middle line:84%
So Jack Parsons
plays a huge role

00:10:24.170 --> 00:10:27.330 align:middle line:84%
in the life of L. Ron
Hubbard, obviously.

00:10:27.330 --> 00:10:30.660 align:middle line:84%
And we see his
Piscean, Captain Ron,

00:10:30.660 --> 00:10:33.070 align:middle line:84%
we see all of his
Piscean influence

00:10:33.070 --> 00:10:37.400 align:middle line:84%
here with Sun conjunct Mercury
and then the trine to Jupiter.

00:10:37.400 --> 00:10:40.160 align:middle line:84%
And here he's got
the trine to Neptune.

00:10:40.160 --> 00:10:43.210 align:middle line:84%
Of the two, L. Ron
Hubbard was probably

00:10:43.210 --> 00:10:45.670 align:middle line:84%
a little more psychic
than Jack Parsons.

00:10:45.670 --> 00:10:50.550 align:middle line:84%
And certainly this could
be the download channel

00:10:50.550 --> 00:10:53.989 align:middle line:84%
for "Dianetics," from
Neptune to Mercury down here

00:10:53.989 --> 00:10:54.780 align:middle line:90%
in the third house.

00:10:54.780 --> 00:10:57.280 align:middle line:84%
What's also really interesting
about the third house

00:10:57.280 --> 00:11:00.320 align:middle line:84%
is the third house is
representative of Gemini.

00:11:00.320 --> 00:11:02.070 align:middle line:84%
Well, it's Gemini's
house, right?

00:11:02.070 --> 00:11:03.070 align:middle line:90%
That's what it is.

00:11:03.070 --> 00:11:05.270 align:middle line:84%
And one of the things that
we associate with Gemini

00:11:05.270 --> 00:11:09.710 align:middle line:84%
is spycraft and espionage and
surveillance and listening

00:11:09.710 --> 00:11:11.970 align:middle line:90%
to people.

00:11:11.970 --> 00:11:15.940 align:middle line:84%
And in the early days of
Scientology in the late '50s

00:11:15.940 --> 00:11:18.750 align:middle line:84%
and early '60s when L. Ron
Hubbard was hanging out

00:11:18.750 --> 00:11:23.350 align:middle line:84%
with people like Errol Flynn
and the author of James Bond

00:11:23.350 --> 00:11:25.250 align:middle line:84%
and "Chitty Chitty Bang
Bang," Ian Fleming,

00:11:25.250 --> 00:11:28.080 align:middle line:84%
they were his buddies, one of
the things that Scientology

00:11:28.080 --> 00:11:30.694 align:middle line:84%
was doing is they
started to do the audits.

00:11:30.694 --> 00:11:32.110 align:middle line:84%
Before there was
psychology, there

00:11:32.110 --> 00:11:34.930 align:middle line:84%
was "Dianetics," which was
a very successful book.

00:11:34.930 --> 00:11:37.320 align:middle line:84%
It was probably one of
the first self-help books

00:11:37.320 --> 00:11:40.320 align:middle line:84%
that had some kind of
mystical bent to it.

00:11:40.320 --> 00:11:41.880 align:middle line:90%
And it sold millions of copies.

00:11:41.880 --> 00:11:43.820 align:middle line:84%
He made a lot of
money off of it.

00:11:43.820 --> 00:11:46.360 align:middle line:84%
So people used to send him
checks in the mail and money

00:11:46.360 --> 00:11:48.270 align:middle line:84%
because they were
thanking him for his book.

00:11:48.270 --> 00:11:50.250 align:middle line:84%
So he had to start
a nonprofit to kind

00:11:50.250 --> 00:11:53.730 align:middle line:84%
of move that money along, hence
the Church of Scientology.

00:11:53.730 --> 00:11:55.430 align:middle line:84%
And so, of course,
what Scientology does

00:11:55.430 --> 00:11:56.730 align:middle line:90%
is it does audits.

00:11:56.730 --> 00:12:00.130 align:middle line:84%
And the audits are based on kind
of a galvanic skin response,

00:12:00.130 --> 00:12:01.750 align:middle line:90%
almost like a lie detector.

00:12:01.750 --> 00:12:03.410 align:middle line:84%
And so they would
take these audits,

00:12:03.410 --> 00:12:05.286 align:middle line:84%
and they would use
this technology,

00:12:05.286 --> 00:12:07.160 align:middle line:84%
and they would use it
with foreign diplomats.

00:12:07.160 --> 00:12:08.369 align:middle line:90%
And this is a true story.

00:12:08.369 --> 00:12:10.410 align:middle line:84%
And the foreign diplomats
or people in government

00:12:10.410 --> 00:12:15.604 align:middle line:84%
would then tell the secrets of
what's going on in their lives,

00:12:15.604 --> 00:12:17.020 align:middle line:84%
because, of course,
you want to be

00:12:17.020 --> 00:12:19.310 align:middle line:84%
able to clear that
with Scientology.

00:12:19.310 --> 00:12:23.125 align:middle line:84%
And then, according to the
son of L. Ron Hubbard, who

00:12:23.125 --> 00:12:28.360 align:middle line:84%
wrote about this--
this is in his book--

00:12:28.360 --> 00:12:30.985 align:middle line:84%
they would use that material
and blackmail these diplomats.

00:12:30.985 --> 00:12:33.142 align:middle line:84%
So we can see that
right down here

00:12:33.142 --> 00:12:34.350 align:middle line:90%
in the third house, spycraft.

00:12:34.350 --> 00:12:37.170 align:middle line:84%
There was spying going on,
intelligence gathering.

00:12:37.170 --> 00:12:38.540 align:middle line:90%
It's what he did in the Navy.

00:12:38.540 --> 00:12:41.340 align:middle line:90%
He couldn't stop doing it.

00:12:41.340 --> 00:12:42.940 align:middle line:90%
This is Wernher von Braun.

00:12:42.940 --> 00:12:46.580 align:middle line:84%
He is slightly older than Jack
Parsons and L. Ron Hubbard.

00:12:46.580 --> 00:12:48.230 align:middle line:90%
He becomes Jack Parsons' mentor.

00:12:48.230 --> 00:12:50.550 align:middle line:84%
Not only was he Jack
Parsons' mentor.

00:12:50.550 --> 00:12:52.450 align:middle line:84%
He's was also Walt
Disney's mentor.

00:12:52.450 --> 00:12:57.580 align:middle line:84%
He comes here, of course, via
Operation Paperclip and Nazi

00:12:57.580 --> 00:12:58.510 align:middle line:90%
Germany.

00:12:58.510 --> 00:13:01.070 align:middle line:84%
And here we have the great
phallic representations

00:13:01.070 --> 00:13:04.650 align:middle line:84%
of the 20th century, our great
rockets, powered by the Saturn

00:13:04.650 --> 00:13:07.430 align:middle line:84%
V and some of Jack Parsons'
technology, obviously.

00:13:07.430 --> 00:13:09.300 align:middle line:90%
Look at those penetrating eyes.

00:13:09.300 --> 00:13:11.310 align:middle line:90%
Let's look at his chart.

00:13:11.310 --> 00:13:11.830 align:middle line:90%
What is he?

00:13:11.830 --> 00:13:14.410 align:middle line:90%
He's an Aries, two degrees.

00:13:14.410 --> 00:13:18.710 align:middle line:84%
And I was just
sharing here earlier

00:13:18.710 --> 00:13:23.420 align:middle line:84%
that his two degrees Aries
Sun is at the same degree

00:13:23.420 --> 00:13:27.070 align:middle line:84%
as the date the Georgia
Guidestones were consecrated.

00:13:27.070 --> 00:13:30.050 align:middle line:84%
Hunter and I were talking about
this before this shoot started.

00:13:30.050 --> 00:13:31.300 align:middle line:90%
So that's kind of interesting.

00:13:31.300 --> 00:13:34.920 align:middle line:84%
But you can definitely see
the Aryan Aries influence

00:13:34.920 --> 00:13:38.520 align:middle line:84%
in his chart, 11th house,
the world of tomorrow.

00:13:38.520 --> 00:13:41.760 align:middle line:84%
There's his true node,
and it's conjunct Mercury.

00:13:41.760 --> 00:13:44.990 align:middle line:84%
He's a man with a mission, and
he certainly surrounded himself

00:13:44.990 --> 00:13:49.750 align:middle line:84%
with some very talented proteges
in Jack Parsons and Walt

00:13:49.750 --> 00:13:50.260 align:middle line:90%
Disney.

00:13:50.260 --> 00:13:52.130 align:middle line:90%
That's the 11th house.

00:13:52.130 --> 00:13:55.840 align:middle line:84%
And here, of course, we see
again on the ascendant Gemini,

00:13:55.840 --> 00:13:58.415 align:middle line:84%
just like Jack Parsons had
on the ascendant, but Mars

00:13:58.415 --> 00:13:59.100 align:middle line:90%
and Pluto.

00:13:59.100 --> 00:14:02.580 align:middle line:84%
And you can see that Mars in
those eyes, a very strong Mars

00:14:02.580 --> 00:14:05.000 align:middle line:84%
presence, somebody
who wants to, again,

00:14:05.000 --> 00:14:08.630 align:middle line:84%
change the world in a very
visceral, almost physical

00:14:08.630 --> 00:14:11.506 align:middle line:84%
fashion with that
Mars-Pluto conjunction.

00:14:11.506 --> 00:14:13.130 align:middle line:84%
And then there's the
square to the Sun.

00:14:13.130 --> 00:14:16.830 align:middle line:84%
This man did not
suffer fools gladly.

00:14:16.830 --> 00:14:19.440 align:middle line:90%
He was one intense dude.

00:14:19.440 --> 00:14:22.920 align:middle line:84%
And then we see some more
Aquarius here on the Midheaven.

00:14:22.920 --> 00:14:25.010 align:middle line:84%
This is a theme we've
been seeing, right?

00:14:25.010 --> 00:14:26.980 align:middle line:84%
The theme is Aquarius
on the Midheaven,

00:14:26.980 --> 00:14:30.570 align:middle line:84%
a lot of these characters and
a lot of these situations.

00:14:30.570 --> 00:14:33.400 align:middle line:84%
Alright, so let's move on
here and go to the next slide.

00:14:33.400 --> 00:14:36.530 align:middle line:84%
Here's Jack Parsons
hanging out in the desert

00:14:36.530 --> 00:14:38.620 align:middle line:84%
with some rockets,
blowing things up.

00:14:38.620 --> 00:14:41.610 align:middle line:90%


00:14:41.610 --> 00:14:45.750 align:middle line:84%
Now I put together some symbols
and some interesting kinds

00:14:45.750 --> 00:14:49.310 align:middle line:84%
of connections here with
the Babalon Working.

00:14:49.310 --> 00:14:52.020 align:middle line:84%
So this is the
yantra that they use.

00:14:52.020 --> 00:14:56.570 align:middle line:84%
So they would have been
inside of this yantra.

00:14:56.570 --> 00:15:03.260 align:middle line:84%
And the angles of the yantra
are all at 51.51 degrees.

00:15:03.260 --> 00:15:04.800 align:middle line:90%
And there are seven angles.

00:15:04.800 --> 00:15:12.280 align:middle line:84%
So 7 times 51.51, you
get 360 degrees .57,

00:15:12.280 --> 00:15:16.070 align:middle line:84%
which is 360 degrees, the
number of the ancient calendar.

00:15:16.070 --> 00:15:19.850 align:middle line:84%
It was a 360-degree calendar,
but five days were tacked on.

00:15:19.850 --> 00:15:24.380 align:middle line:84%
And then it's also the
circumference of the zodiac,

00:15:24.380 --> 00:15:28.505 align:middle line:84%
so 360, 360 degrees of wisdom,
the actual wheel itself.

00:15:28.505 --> 00:15:30.680 align:middle line:84%
And this is where
it all took place.

00:15:30.680 --> 00:15:34.445 align:middle line:84%
Now because of this, they were
connected to the timeline.

00:15:34.445 --> 00:15:35.820 align:middle line:84%
They were connected
to the place,

00:15:35.820 --> 00:15:38.720 align:middle line:84%
and they were connected to
the original timeline, the 360

00:15:38.720 --> 00:15:43.630 align:middle line:84%
degrees, the 360
days of the Sphinx

00:15:43.630 --> 00:15:48.010 align:middle line:84%
and the connection to not
just Egypt but even Babalon.

00:15:48.010 --> 00:15:50.540 align:middle line:90%
Babalon means baby lion.

00:15:50.540 --> 00:15:52.880 align:middle line:84%
That's what it means,
baby lion, little lion.

00:15:52.880 --> 00:15:56.640 align:middle line:84%
And lions are interesting,
because on one hand

00:15:56.640 --> 00:16:02.831 align:middle line:84%
they're symbols of Christ,
like in Aslan the lion, right?

00:16:02.831 --> 00:16:03.830 align:middle line:90%
He's a symbol of Christ.

00:16:03.830 --> 00:16:06.280 align:middle line:84%
But they can also
be terrible animals,

00:16:06.280 --> 00:16:09.130 align:middle line:84%
and they can tear you
from limb to limb.

00:16:09.130 --> 00:16:12.310 align:middle line:84%
So the lion has kind of a
dualistic energy as well.

00:16:12.310 --> 00:16:14.570 align:middle line:90%
So baby lion equals Babalon.

00:16:14.570 --> 00:16:17.200 align:middle line:84%
There is the Sphinx,
and over here we

00:16:17.200 --> 00:16:21.120 align:middle line:84%
have some images of Baast,
the cat god of Egypt.

00:16:21.120 --> 00:16:25.050 align:middle line:84%
So we're starting to look at
hybridization, because there's

00:16:25.050 --> 00:16:29.680 align:middle line:84%
the anthropomorphic promotion
of gods and deities in Atlant--

00:16:29.680 --> 00:16:30.350 align:middle line:90%
I'm sorry.

00:16:30.350 --> 00:16:32.110 align:middle line:84%
In Atlantis as
well, but in Egypt.

00:16:32.110 --> 00:16:34.510 align:middle line:84%
And I actually believe
that these hybrids existed,

00:16:34.510 --> 00:16:37.460 align:middle line:84%
and I don't think that they
were figments of imagination.

00:16:37.460 --> 00:16:39.390 align:middle line:84%
I believe that they
actually existed,

00:16:39.390 --> 00:16:41.200 align:middle line:84%
and they were either
from other planets

00:16:41.200 --> 00:16:45.420 align:middle line:84%
or interdimensional or actually
hybrid refugees from Atlantis.

00:16:45.420 --> 00:16:47.730 align:middle line:84%
But I like this 1970s
kind of jumpsuit

00:16:47.730 --> 00:16:50.795 align:middle line:84%
with the athletic socks thing
going on here with Baast,

00:16:50.795 --> 00:16:52.450 align:middle line:90%
the cat god of Egypt.

00:16:52.450 --> 00:16:54.300 align:middle line:90%
So Baast actually means beast.

00:16:54.300 --> 00:16:55.810 align:middle line:84%
So what they're
trying to do here,

00:16:55.810 --> 00:16:59.710 align:middle line:84%
by the way, with the
Babalon Working is they're

00:16:59.710 --> 00:17:05.579 align:middle line:84%
trying to bring forth this
goddess energy, the return

00:17:05.579 --> 00:17:08.359 align:middle line:84%
of the goddess,
which is the baby

00:17:08.359 --> 00:17:11.910 align:middle line:84%
lion, half human,
half lion, the head

00:17:11.910 --> 00:17:14.170 align:middle line:84%
of a human with
the body of a lion.

00:17:14.170 --> 00:17:14.730 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:17:14.730 --> 00:17:18.984 align:middle line:84%
And so what two signs
do they represent,

00:17:18.984 --> 00:17:21.400 align:middle line:84%
the human and the lion, the
head and the body of the lion?

00:17:21.400 --> 00:17:24.014 align:middle line:84%
We're going to figure that
out real quickly here.

00:17:24.014 --> 00:17:25.180 align:middle line:90%
This is the Babalon Working.

00:17:25.180 --> 00:17:28.000 align:middle line:84%
This is kind of a rough sketch
for the Babalon Working.

00:17:28.000 --> 00:17:32.600 align:middle line:84%
It was the first three months
of 1949, hence Libra 49.

00:17:32.600 --> 00:17:36.450 align:middle line:84%
And the three signs
that it went through

00:17:36.450 --> 00:17:39.220 align:middle line:84%
were Capricorn,
Aquarius, Pisces.

00:17:39.220 --> 00:17:41.520 align:middle line:84%
I'm thinking that
it might have gotten

00:17:41.520 --> 00:17:45.210 align:middle line:84%
into a little bit of Aries as
well, only because of a degree

00:17:45.210 --> 00:17:46.520 align:middle line:90%
that I found here.

00:17:46.520 --> 00:17:48.540 align:middle line:84%
So this is the third
quadrant of the chart.

00:17:48.540 --> 00:17:50.040 align:middle line:84%
It's the final
stage of the chart.

00:17:50.040 --> 00:17:52.830 align:middle line:84%
It's the final phase
of zodiacal completion.

00:17:52.830 --> 00:17:56.510 align:middle line:84%
Now I believe that they chose
these months specifically

00:17:56.510 --> 00:17:59.410 align:middle line:84%
because of the representation
between Capricorn, Aquarius,

00:17:59.410 --> 00:18:01.100 align:middle line:90%
and Pisces.

00:18:01.100 --> 00:18:04.610 align:middle line:84%
Saturn was in the sign
of Virgo at that time,

00:18:04.610 --> 00:18:06.470 align:middle line:84%
and it was six
degrees retrograde.

00:18:06.470 --> 00:18:08.860 align:middle line:84%
So Saturn is now
moving backward.

00:18:08.860 --> 00:18:10.090 align:middle line:90%
It's a return, right?

00:18:10.090 --> 00:18:11.597 align:middle line:90%
That's what retrograde means.

00:18:11.597 --> 00:18:12.180 align:middle line:90%
It's a return.

00:18:12.180 --> 00:18:16.190 align:middle line:84%
So they're using
the Saturn energy

00:18:16.190 --> 00:18:19.300 align:middle line:84%
all the way through
this three-month ritual

00:18:19.300 --> 00:18:23.880 align:middle line:84%
to go backwards, to go
backwards in time and space

00:18:23.880 --> 00:18:28.110 align:middle line:84%
to channel the spirit of
Babalon or the baby lion.

00:18:28.110 --> 00:18:30.240 align:middle line:84%
Now this is an
interesting sculpture.

00:18:30.240 --> 00:18:32.540 align:middle line:84%
These started to
show up in Europe

00:18:32.540 --> 00:18:35.230 align:middle line:90%
anywhere between 1600 to 1800.

00:18:35.230 --> 00:18:37.610 align:middle line:90%
This is in La Granja, Spain.

00:18:37.610 --> 00:18:39.720 align:middle line:84%
And of course, we see
the head of a woman

00:18:39.720 --> 00:18:40.790 align:middle line:90%
and the body of a lion.

00:18:40.790 --> 00:18:43.409 align:middle line:84%
She's a representation
of a lion goddess.

00:18:43.409 --> 00:18:44.450 align:middle line:90%
She's the goddess, right?

00:18:44.450 --> 00:18:46.720 align:middle line:90%
This is what she looks like.

00:18:46.720 --> 00:18:50.240 align:middle line:84%
And the Sabian symbol for
seven Virgo, which I thought

00:18:50.240 --> 00:18:51.900 align:middle line:84%
was interesting--
because you always

00:18:51.900 --> 00:18:53.950 align:middle line:84%
go up one degree with
the Sabian symbols.

00:18:53.950 --> 00:18:58.520 align:middle line:84%
You go to the next degree-- so
the Sabian symbol for 7 Virgo

00:18:58.520 --> 00:19:01.390 align:middle line:90%
is a harem.

00:19:01.390 --> 00:19:03.650 align:middle line:90%
It's not quite a classic harem.

00:19:03.650 --> 00:19:05.690 align:middle line:84%
But what they're
doing is something

00:19:05.690 --> 00:19:10.330 align:middle line:84%
outside the bounds of
kind of social order

00:19:10.330 --> 00:19:11.700 align:middle line:90%
and social agreement.

00:19:11.700 --> 00:19:16.870 align:middle line:84%
And it's not quite a harem, but
it's kind of in that territory.

00:19:16.870 --> 00:19:19.560 align:middle line:84%
Now what's fascinating
here is again it

00:19:19.560 --> 00:19:22.960 align:middle line:84%
starts off in Saturn in
Virgo six degrees retrograde.

00:19:22.960 --> 00:19:24.070 align:middle line:90%
What does Virgo represent?

00:19:24.070 --> 00:19:25.490 align:middle line:90%
Virgo represents the head.

00:19:25.490 --> 00:19:26.900 align:middle line:90%
It represents rationality.

00:19:26.900 --> 00:19:30.530 align:middle line:84%
It resents being able to make
lucid choices, very human,

00:19:30.530 --> 00:19:31.560 align:middle line:90%
right?

00:19:31.560 --> 00:19:33.949 align:middle line:84%
Now where is Saturn
going if it's retrograde?

00:19:33.949 --> 00:19:35.490 align:middle line:84%
It's going to go
back into what sign?

00:19:35.490 --> 00:19:39.305 align:middle line:84%
It's going to go back
into Leo, the lion.

00:19:39.305 --> 00:19:41.030 align:middle line:84%
So here we have
Saturn retrograde.

00:19:41.030 --> 00:19:47.070 align:middle line:90%


00:19:47.070 --> 00:19:49.700 align:middle line:84%
It started on the
1st of January,

00:19:49.700 --> 00:19:53.630 align:middle line:84%
but it goes to 0 degrees
Virgo on 3/23/49.

00:19:53.630 --> 00:19:54.530 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:19:54.530 --> 00:19:55.590 align:middle line:90%
And remember that.

00:19:55.590 --> 00:19:56.890 align:middle line:90%
Remember the 0 degree Virgo.

00:19:56.890 --> 00:19:58.890 align:middle line:84%
We're going to talk about
this on the next show,

00:19:58.890 --> 00:20:01.810 align:middle line:84%
if you keep following along
here, because this degree has

00:20:01.810 --> 00:20:03.800 align:middle line:90%
ramifications for the future.

00:20:03.800 --> 00:20:09.400 align:middle line:84%
Mars in Aries goes to
0 degrees on 3/22/49.

00:20:09.400 --> 00:20:13.260 align:middle line:84%
So we're seeing Virgo go to
its 0 degree going backwards.

00:20:13.260 --> 00:20:18.660 align:middle line:84%
We're seeing Mars go into its
rulership with Aries on 3/22,

00:20:18.660 --> 00:20:20.900 align:middle line:84%
and a lot of energy
with Mars in Aries.

00:20:20.900 --> 00:20:26.400 align:middle line:84%
And Jupiter goes into
Aquarius on 4/13/49.

00:20:26.400 --> 00:20:29.450 align:middle line:84%
So we're seeing moving planets
here and the accumulation

00:20:29.450 --> 00:20:32.604 align:middle line:84%
of energy as theoretically
they go deeper into this.

00:20:32.604 --> 00:20:34.520 align:middle line:84%
But what happens and
what's really interesting

00:20:34.520 --> 00:20:39.250 align:middle line:84%
is that on 4/4/49 Saturn
goes retrograde into Leo.

00:20:39.250 --> 00:20:42.690 align:middle line:84%
So it starts here in Virgo,
and then theoretically it

00:20:42.690 --> 00:20:45.190 align:middle line:90%
ends here in Leo.

00:20:45.190 --> 00:20:49.050 align:middle line:84%
So you can see the
astrological flow

00:20:49.050 --> 00:20:51.030 align:middle line:84%
taking place in the
Babalon Working.

00:20:51.030 --> 00:20:53.540 align:middle line:84%
Now what happens as
a result of this?

00:20:53.540 --> 00:20:55.700 align:middle line:90%
Oh, that's Marilyn Monroe.

00:20:55.700 --> 00:20:57.230 align:middle line:84%
One of the things
that's been talked

00:20:57.230 --> 00:21:02.850 align:middle line:84%
about as a result of the moonlet
or the birth of the goddess

00:21:02.850 --> 00:21:06.030 align:middle line:84%
through the Babalon
Working is that we

00:21:06.030 --> 00:21:08.510 align:middle line:84%
have the scarlet woman
or the lady in red

00:21:08.510 --> 00:21:12.340 align:middle line:84%
or the Whore of
Babalon, which becomes

00:21:12.340 --> 00:21:15.500 align:middle line:84%
a prominent symbol
in the 20th century.

00:21:15.500 --> 00:21:20.490 align:middle line:84%
And not long after
this ritual takes

00:21:20.490 --> 00:21:24.380 align:middle line:84%
place, Marilyn Monroe,
famous lady in red character,

00:21:24.380 --> 00:21:26.330 align:middle line:90%
Gemini, pops onto the scene.

00:21:26.330 --> 00:21:28.710 align:middle line:84%
Marilyn Monroe has kind
of a very troubled past.

00:21:28.710 --> 00:21:31.365 align:middle line:84%
Of course everybody
knows her as Norma Jean

00:21:31.365 --> 00:21:32.740 align:middle line:84%
before she became
Marilyn Monroe.

00:21:32.740 --> 00:21:38.790 align:middle line:84%
But apparently she actually
met Anton LaVey at a piano bar.

00:21:38.790 --> 00:21:41.860 align:middle line:84%
I think it was somewhere
in Ohio or Kansas

00:21:41.860 --> 00:21:43.150 align:middle line:90%
or someplace in the Midwest.

00:21:43.150 --> 00:21:46.010 align:middle line:84%
And she was a singer, and
she hooked up with him,

00:21:46.010 --> 00:21:47.620 align:middle line:90%
and she sang with him.

00:21:47.620 --> 00:21:50.700 align:middle line:84%
And so her connections
to the occult world

00:21:50.700 --> 00:21:54.700 align:middle line:90%
early on are pretty interesting.

00:21:54.700 --> 00:21:57.280 align:middle line:84%
But she's the
first manifestation

00:21:57.280 --> 00:22:01.190 align:middle line:84%
of the lady in red or,
for lack of a better term,

00:22:01.190 --> 00:22:04.300 align:middle line:84%
more coarse terms,
the Whore of Babalon,

00:22:04.300 --> 00:22:07.600 align:middle line:84%
or the feminine
symbol of Babalon.

00:22:07.600 --> 00:22:11.150 align:middle line:84%
And of course she was also
part of the Kennedy timeline

00:22:11.150 --> 00:22:12.710 align:middle line:90%
as well.

00:22:12.710 --> 00:22:16.270 align:middle line:84%
Here's another
interesting modern symbol

00:22:16.270 --> 00:22:17.280 align:middle line:90%
for the lady in red.

00:22:17.280 --> 00:22:20.500 align:middle line:84%
This is from the movie,
of course, "The Matrix."

00:22:20.500 --> 00:22:23.860 align:middle line:84%
And it's a very
interesting scene

00:22:23.860 --> 00:22:27.420 align:middle line:84%
inside the matrix that's
been programmed, by the way.

00:22:27.420 --> 00:22:30.610 align:middle line:84%
And she's there to
amuse the programmer

00:22:30.610 --> 00:22:34.940 align:middle line:84%
but also to try to make
sure that Neo doesn't lose

00:22:34.940 --> 00:22:37.170 align:middle line:84%
his concentration
and focus, which

00:22:37.170 --> 00:22:39.590 align:middle line:84%
he does for just a little
bit inside the matrix,

00:22:39.590 --> 00:22:41.210 align:middle line:90%
inside the program.

00:22:41.210 --> 00:22:45.130 align:middle line:84%
So this is kind of a
fascinating representation

00:22:45.130 --> 00:22:47.480 align:middle line:84%
of the lady in red
or the scarlet woman,

00:22:47.480 --> 00:22:50.400 align:middle line:84%
to not be distracted by
it, to keep your focus.

00:22:50.400 --> 00:22:51.200 align:middle line:90%
Here's another one.

00:22:51.200 --> 00:22:55.240 align:middle line:84%
Oh, yeah, this is Dana Barrett,
also known as Sigourney Weaver

00:22:55.240 --> 00:23:00.420 align:middle line:84%
from the movie "Ghostbusters,"
where she is now really kind

00:23:00.420 --> 00:23:03.950 align:middle line:84%
of the cinematic
manifestation literally

00:23:03.950 --> 00:23:09.040 align:middle line:84%
of the moonlet expression or
the channelling of the moonlet.

00:23:09.040 --> 00:23:11.480 align:middle line:84%
Through this movie
"Ghostbusters," of course

00:23:11.480 --> 00:23:15.360 align:middle line:84%
she's channeling Gozer,
the ancient Sumerian deity,

00:23:15.360 --> 00:23:18.781 align:middle line:84%
and they're on top of the
Roerich building in New York

00:23:18.781 --> 00:23:19.280 align:middle line:90%
City.

00:23:19.280 --> 00:23:22.559 align:middle line:84%
And Nicholas Roerich, of
course, is the great mystic,

00:23:22.559 --> 00:23:23.100 align:middle line:90%
in some ways.

00:23:23.100 --> 00:23:26.080 align:middle line:84%
Some people thought he was
a con man as well, but kind

00:23:26.080 --> 00:23:27.930 align:middle line:84%
of an interesting
and powerful guy

00:23:27.930 --> 00:23:32.900 align:middle line:84%
that was very much a part of
the occult and magical evolution

00:23:32.900 --> 00:23:34.465 align:middle line:90%
of the 20th century.

00:23:34.465 --> 00:23:37.070 align:middle line:84%
He was an artist, a painter,
and a lot of other things.

00:23:37.070 --> 00:23:38.519 align:middle line:90%
He probably was also a spy.

00:23:38.519 --> 00:23:40.310 align:middle line:84%
But anyway, that's on
the Roerich building.

00:23:40.310 --> 00:23:41.790 align:middle line:90%
That was built for him.

00:23:41.790 --> 00:23:44.010 align:middle line:84%
And there she is,
another manifestation

00:23:44.010 --> 00:23:46.880 align:middle line:84%
of the lady in red or
the scarlet woman or the,

00:23:46.880 --> 00:23:48.480 align:middle line:84%
quote, unquote
"Whore of Babalon"

00:23:48.480 --> 00:23:50.280 align:middle line:90%
cinematically portrayed.

00:23:50.280 --> 00:23:54.180 align:middle line:84%
By the way, she does
give birth to kind

00:23:54.180 --> 00:24:00.350 align:middle line:84%
of her own sort of alien
multi-dimensional creature in,

00:24:00.350 --> 00:24:02.310 align:middle line:90%
I think it's "Aliens 3."

00:24:02.310 --> 00:24:06.340 align:middle line:84%
So she eventually does
what she theoretically

00:24:06.340 --> 00:24:09.240 align:middle line:84%
is supposed to do as
this representation

00:24:09.240 --> 00:24:10.150 align:middle line:90%
of the lady in red.

00:24:10.150 --> 00:24:12.160 align:middle line:84%
But of course it's
a different film.

00:24:12.160 --> 00:24:15.990 align:middle line:84%
And here we have Joan,
one of the more modern

00:24:15.990 --> 00:24:18.530 align:middle line:84%
and contemporary versions
of the same woman.

00:24:18.530 --> 00:24:23.750 align:middle line:84%
Of course, she's in "Mad Men"
and a classic lady in red.

00:24:23.750 --> 00:24:28.360 align:middle line:84%
And what's fascinating about
her is the subtle kinds

00:24:28.360 --> 00:24:32.940 align:middle line:84%
of overtones that are
associated with her

00:24:32.940 --> 00:24:35.890 align:middle line:84%
and the whole notion of
the Whore of Babalon.

00:24:35.890 --> 00:24:37.480 align:middle line:84%
Because there are
a couple things

00:24:37.480 --> 00:24:40.370 align:middle line:84%
that Joan does
inside of "Mad Men"

00:24:40.370 --> 00:24:43.310 align:middle line:84%
that really kind of
consecrate this title.

00:24:43.310 --> 00:24:47.680 align:middle line:84%
One of the things she does
is she sleeps with this man.

00:24:47.680 --> 00:24:49.660 align:middle line:90%
This is Roger.

00:24:49.660 --> 00:24:51.650 align:middle line:90%
His name is Roger Sterling.

00:24:51.650 --> 00:24:53.340 align:middle line:90%
And she has his baby.

00:24:53.340 --> 00:24:54.340 align:middle line:90%
She has Roger's baby.

00:24:54.340 --> 00:24:57.097 align:middle line:84%
So Roger is going
to give her money.

00:24:57.097 --> 00:24:57.930 align:middle line:90%
They're not married.

00:24:57.930 --> 00:24:58.790 align:middle line:90%
She has his baby.

00:24:58.790 --> 00:25:00.080 align:middle line:90%
He's going to giver her money.

00:25:00.080 --> 00:25:02.000 align:middle line:84%
He's going to give her
some support, right?

00:25:02.000 --> 00:25:04.570 align:middle line:90%
Roger is slang for fornication.

00:25:04.570 --> 00:25:05.720 align:middle line:90%
That's what Roger means.

00:25:05.720 --> 00:25:08.430 align:middle line:84%
And Sterling, of
course, is silver,

00:25:08.430 --> 00:25:10.720 align:middle line:90%
which is the devil's currency.

00:25:10.720 --> 00:25:16.470 align:middle line:84%
That's what Judas sold Jesus
out for is 40 pieces of silver.

00:25:16.470 --> 00:25:18.630 align:middle line:84%
So we have Roger
Sterling, and she

00:25:18.630 --> 00:25:21.390 align:middle line:84%
has a relationship with him, not
only a relationship but a baby.

00:25:21.390 --> 00:25:25.630 align:middle line:84%
And she also, by the
way, sleeps with a client

00:25:25.630 --> 00:25:28.010 align:middle line:84%
and gets a part of
the partnership.

00:25:28.010 --> 00:25:31.160 align:middle line:84%
So now she's on equal
footing with the men.

00:25:31.160 --> 00:25:33.600 align:middle line:84%
So she's a very interesting
contemporary figure

00:25:33.600 --> 00:25:36.050 align:middle line:84%
as it relates back
to the Babalon

00:25:36.050 --> 00:25:41.400 align:middle line:84%
Working and the invocation of
the goddess, the Great Goddess

00:25:41.400 --> 00:25:45.100 align:middle line:84%
that Cameron and Parsons and L.
Ron Hubbard were involved in.

00:25:45.100 --> 00:25:47.130 align:middle line:84%
Now of course there's
this trickle-down theory

00:25:47.130 --> 00:25:51.420 align:middle line:84%
in all things of life, including
advertising and marketing.

00:25:51.420 --> 00:25:54.140 align:middle line:84%
Because, hey, wouldn't you
want to be a lady in red?

00:25:54.140 --> 00:25:55.130 align:middle line:90%
Sure, why not?

00:25:55.130 --> 00:25:56.335 align:middle line:90%
There's a hair tip.

00:25:56.335 --> 00:25:59.480 align:middle line:84%
A professional shampoo and
set may sound old-fashioned,

00:25:59.480 --> 00:26:01.640 align:middle line:84%
but it gives hair a
long-lasting lift.

00:26:01.640 --> 00:26:02.320 align:middle line:90%
Makeup tip?

00:26:02.320 --> 00:26:05.650 align:middle line:84%
Makeup was matte in those
days, including lipsticks.

00:26:05.650 --> 00:26:08.885 align:middle line:84%
But if yours are all gloss,
then just apply, blot,

00:26:08.885 --> 00:26:12.470 align:middle line:84%
and take the shine off with a
little bit of dusting powder.

00:26:12.470 --> 00:26:15.710 align:middle line:84%
Of course, the clothes: red
dress, medium and small.

00:26:15.710 --> 00:26:18.292 align:middle line:84%
You can get that
for a pound 39.50.

00:26:18.292 --> 00:26:19.250 align:middle line:90%
And then the style tip.

00:26:19.250 --> 00:26:23.350 align:middle line:84%
Christina favors jewel colors:
red, green, purple that ooze

00:26:23.350 --> 00:26:24.690 align:middle line:90%
confidence.

00:26:24.690 --> 00:26:27.040 align:middle line:84%
So if you want to be a
lady in red in waiting

00:26:27.040 --> 00:26:28.480 align:middle line:84%
or just a lady in
red in general,

00:26:28.480 --> 00:26:30.930 align:middle line:84%
if you want to embody the
spirit of the goddess all

00:26:30.930 --> 00:26:34.590 align:middle line:84%
the way from Babalon,
there's your outfit.

00:26:34.590 --> 00:26:37.280 align:middle line:84%
So we've gone full
circle, really.

00:26:37.280 --> 00:26:39.990 align:middle line:84%
We started with Jack
Parsons and introducing him.

00:26:39.990 --> 00:26:43.980 align:middle line:84%
And now here we have the
manifestation to the masses.

00:26:43.980 --> 00:26:46.950 align:middle line:84%
Now in the next episode of
"The Eleventh House," what

00:26:46.950 --> 00:26:49.630 align:middle line:84%
we're going to do is we're
going to move forward,

00:26:49.630 --> 00:26:52.900 align:middle line:84%
and we're going to get into
some very interesting details

00:26:52.900 --> 00:26:57.000 align:middle line:84%
as to how the Babalon Working is
affecting us right here and now

00:26:57.000 --> 00:26:59.040 align:middle line:84%
and where it's going to
be affecting us possibly

00:26:59.040 --> 00:27:00.850 align:middle line:90%
even a year from now.

00:27:00.850 --> 00:27:03.961 align:middle line:84%
So don't miss the next episode,
"Babalon Working 2," here

00:27:03.961 --> 00:27:04.960 align:middle line:90%
on "The Eleventh House."

00:27:04.960 --> 00:27:07.540 align:middle line:84%
I'm Robert Phoenix, and
thanks for tuning in.

00:27:07.540 --> 00:27:17.834 align:middle line:90%
