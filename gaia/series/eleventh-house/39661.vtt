00:00:11.904 --> 00:00:20.370 align:middle line:10%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:20.370 --> 00:00:24.920 align:middle line:84%
Well, I think astrology
probably comes from Atlantis,

00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:27.800 align:middle line:84%
but it has a really
strong run in Babylon.

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:30.280 align:middle line:84%
And of course,
Egypt with Ptolemy.

00:00:30.280 --> 00:00:33.090 align:middle line:84%
He's the father of
Western astrology.

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:38.460 align:middle line:84%
And that's where we have
the template for astrology.

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:41.000 align:middle line:84%
I would say that ultimately
it's probably off-planet.

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:42.880 align:middle line:90%
Maybe it's from Sirius.

00:00:42.880 --> 00:00:44.140 align:middle line:90%
That's my best guess.

00:00:44.140 --> 00:00:49.270 align:middle line:90%


00:00:49.270 --> 00:00:51.890 align:middle line:84%
I think the original
intention of astrology

00:00:51.890 --> 00:00:55.970 align:middle line:84%
was to have a synchretic
system that allowed

00:00:55.970 --> 00:01:00.690 align:middle line:84%
people to navigate both
on land and in sea,

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:01.960 align:middle line:90%
but also their lives.

00:01:01.960 --> 00:01:04.830 align:middle line:84%
It was this kind of
multi-dimensional

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:06.230 align:middle line:90%
navigational tool.

00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:11.610 align:middle line:84%
And a tool to live by with
the inner life and a tool

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:14.058 align:middle line:84%
to travel by with
the outer life.

00:01:14.058 --> 00:01:18.270 align:middle line:90%


00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:21.370 align:middle line:84%
A lot of times we tend to think
that this is all out there.

00:01:21.370 --> 00:01:23.030 align:middle line:84%
But it's all happening
inside of us.

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:25.681 align:middle line:84%
So there's no differentiation
between the inner

00:01:25.681 --> 00:01:26.380 align:middle line:90%
and the outer.

00:01:26.380 --> 00:01:31.410 align:middle line:84%
So the map itself is really
just an extraction of what's

00:01:31.410 --> 00:01:32.650 align:middle line:90%
taking place on the inside.

00:01:32.650 --> 00:01:37.770 align:middle line:84%
It's almost like in
some shamanic cultures,

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:39.190 align:middle line:84%
they'll take an
animal, they'll take

00:01:39.190 --> 00:01:40.910 align:middle line:90%
the entrails out of the animal.

00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:42.587 align:middle line:84%
And they'll throw it and
they'll put it on a fire.

00:01:42.587 --> 00:01:43.820 align:middle line:84%
Or, they'll throw
them on the ground.

00:01:43.820 --> 00:01:45.510 align:middle line:90%
They'll read the entrails.

00:01:45.510 --> 00:01:48.310 align:middle line:84%
Well, astrology is kind of like
that, but without the blood.

00:01:48.310 --> 00:01:50.500 align:middle line:84%
We're reading the
psychic entrails

00:01:50.500 --> 00:01:54.160 align:middle line:84%
of what's happening in time and
space within the individual.

00:01:54.160 --> 00:01:57.850 align:middle line:84%
So it's theoretically
not happening out there,

00:01:57.850 --> 00:02:00.950 align:middle line:90%
but it's happening in here.

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:03.560 align:middle line:84%
We're using the
map to get inside

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:06.040 align:middle line:90%
of the body, mind, spirit.

00:02:06.040 --> 00:02:10.539 align:middle line:90%


00:02:10.539 --> 00:02:13.940 align:middle line:84%
People focus on their sun signs
because that's what they know.

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:18.360 align:middle line:84%
It's a very superficial
rendering of astrology.

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:21.910 align:middle line:84%
And most astrology
columns-- if you

00:02:21.910 --> 00:02:24.010 align:middle line:84%
go to read one of the
famous astrologers,

00:02:24.010 --> 00:02:26.910 align:middle line:84%
Sydney Omarr, whatever--
they generally

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:30.450 align:middle line:90%
tend to look at the sun sign.

00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:32.800 align:middle line:84%
And they put it on the
rising angle of the chart

00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:34.220 align:middle line:84%
and then they look
at everything else.

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:38.590 align:middle line:84%
So, it's important to at
least know your rising sign

00:02:38.590 --> 00:02:40.020 align:middle line:90%
or ascendant.

00:02:40.020 --> 00:02:43.400 align:middle line:84%
And once you know your
rising sign or ascendant,

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:45.030 align:middle line:84%
and you need to know
your sun sign, generally

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:46.170 align:middle line:84%
at that point
people want to know

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:47.820 align:middle line:90%
more about astrology, anyway.

00:02:47.820 --> 00:02:49.610 align:middle line:84%
And then they find out,
well, I'm really two signs.

00:02:49.610 --> 00:02:51.760 align:middle line:84%
Well, you're more
than two signs,

00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:52.860 align:middle line:90%
you're a number of signs.

00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:54.260 align:middle line:84%
And you're a number
of signs through time.

00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:56.380 align:middle line:84%
You're always changing through
transits and progressions.

00:02:56.380 --> 00:02:58.570 align:middle line:90%
And it can get pretty complex.

00:02:58.570 --> 00:03:00.220 align:middle line:84%
But I just think
that most people

00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:01.940 align:middle line:90%
have a cursory knowledge.

00:03:01.940 --> 00:03:04.780 align:middle line:84%
And they say, well, I'm
a Virgo or I'm a Gemini

00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:07.054 align:middle line:84%
and this is what I'm
supposed to be like.

00:03:07.054 --> 00:03:08.920 align:middle line:84%
And I find that most people
are generally pretty curious

00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:09.780 align:middle line:90%
and want to know more.

00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:15.670 align:middle line:90%


00:03:15.670 --> 00:03:18.000 align:middle line:84%
There are 12 houses
in the chart.

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:22.980 align:middle line:84%
And the house is a zone
or sector or mansion.

00:03:22.980 --> 00:03:24.320 align:middle line:90%
Some people call them mansions.

00:03:24.320 --> 00:03:29.260 align:middle line:10%
And that house is
determined by the ascendant

00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:30.720 align:middle line:10%
at the time of birth.

00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:34.160 align:middle line:10%
And planets are then splayed
across the chart based

00:03:34.160 --> 00:03:36.750 align:middle line:10%
on the degree that they're in.

00:03:36.750 --> 00:03:39.230 align:middle line:84%
And then they show up
in the various houses.

00:03:39.230 --> 00:03:42.570 align:middle line:84%
And if a planet lives
in a particular house,

00:03:42.570 --> 00:03:43.990 align:middle line:90%
you begin to look at that house.

00:03:43.990 --> 00:03:47.310 align:middle line:84%
And there's an emphasis in
the individual's life with

00:03:47.310 --> 00:03:48.980 align:middle line:90%
that planet, with that house.

00:03:48.980 --> 00:03:50.660 align:middle line:84%
And then we look
at angles coming

00:03:50.660 --> 00:03:53.880 align:middle line:84%
out of that house with
the various planets

00:03:53.880 --> 00:03:55.150 align:middle line:90%
across the chart.

00:03:55.150 --> 00:03:58.260 align:middle line:84%
So the house is like
a temporary home

00:03:58.260 --> 00:04:01.040 align:middle line:84%
in this lifetime for a
particular planet in your life

00:04:01.040 --> 00:04:01.960 align:middle line:90%
at the time of your birth.

00:04:01.960 --> 00:04:06.289 align:middle line:90%


00:04:06.289 --> 00:04:07.800 align:middle line:90%
The anaretic degree.

00:04:07.800 --> 00:04:10.820 align:middle line:84%
I happen to be born on
September 22nd, which

00:04:10.820 --> 00:04:12.970 align:middle line:90%
is the 29th degree of Virgo.

00:04:12.970 --> 00:04:15.240 align:middle line:84%
And the 29th degree
is an anaretic.

00:04:15.240 --> 00:04:16.910 align:middle line:90%
It's called the anaretic degree.

00:04:16.910 --> 00:04:19.410 align:middle line:84%
And it's the last
degree of the sign.

00:04:19.410 --> 00:04:22.400 align:middle line:84%
And that's when the
energy of the sign

00:04:22.400 --> 00:04:24.520 align:middle line:90%
has almost spent itself.

00:04:24.520 --> 00:04:25.990 align:middle line:90%
It's almost done.

00:04:25.990 --> 00:04:29.610 align:middle line:84%
And if you're born with
an anaretic degree,

00:04:29.610 --> 00:04:31.391 align:middle line:84%
you think you're almost
done with the sign.

00:04:31.391 --> 00:04:32.090 align:middle line:90%
You're over.

00:04:32.090 --> 00:04:33.690 align:middle line:84%
It's like I came
in this lifetime,

00:04:33.690 --> 00:04:34.760 align:middle line:90%
I'm over being a Virgo.

00:04:34.760 --> 00:04:37.000 align:middle line:90%
I'm ready to move on.

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:39.930 align:middle line:84%
But unfortunately, what happens
is is that you have to really

00:04:39.930 --> 00:04:43.830 align:middle line:84%
focus on that degree even
more than say if it was

00:04:43.830 --> 00:04:46.340 align:middle line:90%
at 12 degrees or three degrees.

00:04:46.340 --> 00:04:50.250 align:middle line:84%
You have a lesson to finish
with that degree and that sign.

00:04:50.250 --> 00:04:54.070 align:middle line:84%
And until you really
bear down and do it,

00:04:54.070 --> 00:04:57.190 align:middle line:84%
you don't really get
to graduate, I suppose,

00:04:57.190 --> 00:04:59.550 align:middle line:84%
out of that sign or
out of this lifetime.

00:04:59.550 --> 00:05:01.575 align:middle line:84%
And the challenge
with the 29th degree

00:05:01.575 --> 00:05:06.601 align:middle line:84%
is that people tend to have
lots of hard stops and starts

00:05:06.601 --> 00:05:08.360 align:middle line:84%
in their lives.
Beginnings and endings.

00:05:08.360 --> 00:05:09.580 align:middle line:90%
Lots of endings.

00:05:09.580 --> 00:05:13.650 align:middle line:84%
And one of the characteristics
of the 29th degree

00:05:13.650 --> 00:05:17.320 align:middle line:84%
is that people can get
really ramped up with plans,

00:05:17.320 --> 00:05:19.950 align:middle line:84%
and then at the last moment
they could change their mind.

00:05:19.950 --> 00:05:24.160 align:middle line:84%
That's also another not so great
signifier of the 29th degree.

00:05:24.160 --> 00:05:28.370 align:middle line:84%
So the lesson here is
to stick to something,

00:05:28.370 --> 00:05:31.440 align:middle line:84%
to work through something,
and to finish something.

00:05:31.440 --> 00:05:34.690 align:middle line:84%
Whether it's that degree,
that sign, that project,

00:05:34.690 --> 00:05:38.110 align:middle line:84%
that relationship,
whatever that thing is,

00:05:38.110 --> 00:05:42.840 align:middle line:84%
it's essentially a sign to
hang in there and complete.

00:05:42.840 --> 00:05:43.990 align:middle line:90%
That's the 29th degree.

00:05:43.990 --> 00:05:49.230 align:middle line:90%


00:05:49.230 --> 00:05:53.095 align:middle line:84%
We can see this ramping up
with Pluto and Capricorn.

00:05:53.095 --> 00:05:55.680 align:middle line:90%
It starts off in 1516.

00:05:55.680 --> 00:05:57.760 align:middle line:84%
We see the rise of
the states of Europe.

00:05:57.760 --> 00:06:01.020 align:middle line:84%
They're going around the world,
they're colonizing, quote

00:06:01.020 --> 00:06:02.990 align:middle line:90%
unquote, "all these countries."

00:06:02.990 --> 00:06:07.180 align:middle line:84%
And you have the rise to
power of the aristocracy

00:06:07.180 --> 00:06:08.610 align:middle line:90%
during that time.

00:06:08.610 --> 00:06:10.330 align:middle line:84%
They're getting all
these resources, spices,

00:06:10.330 --> 00:06:11.880 align:middle line:90%
gold, silver, you name it.

00:06:11.880 --> 00:06:13.080 align:middle line:84%
They're plundering,
they're bringing

00:06:13.080 --> 00:06:14.260 align:middle line:90%
it back to Western Europe.

00:06:14.260 --> 00:06:16.450 align:middle line:84%
And what we're seeing
now in this version

00:06:16.450 --> 00:06:21.390 align:middle line:84%
of Pluto and Capricorn is
the apotheosis of that.

00:06:21.390 --> 00:06:25.360 align:middle line:84%
That first wave in 1516,
it's all part of this kind

00:06:25.360 --> 00:06:26.220 align:middle line:90%
of ongoing narrative.

00:06:26.220 --> 00:06:29.390 align:middle line:84%
Now in 1776, there's a
break in that, of course,

00:06:29.390 --> 00:06:32.880 align:middle line:84%
because the United
States decides to take

00:06:32.880 --> 00:06:34.600 align:middle line:90%
a left turn from Great Britain.

00:06:34.600 --> 00:06:36.810 align:middle line:84%
Although there are
some people who will

00:06:36.810 --> 00:06:40.890 align:middle line:84%
argue the fact that the
British really won the war.

00:06:40.890 --> 00:06:41.960 align:middle line:90%
They conceded the war.

00:06:41.960 --> 00:06:44.900 align:middle line:84%
And there's all these
documents, and straw men,

00:06:44.900 --> 00:06:48.960 align:middle line:84%
and the individual is an
asset of the Bank of London

00:06:48.960 --> 00:06:50.580 align:middle line:90%
and the city of London.

00:06:50.580 --> 00:06:53.750 align:middle line:84%
So they'll tell you that
the victory was a sham.

00:06:53.750 --> 00:06:55.600 align:middle line:84%
But whether it's
a sham or not, we

00:06:55.600 --> 00:06:58.660 align:middle line:84%
can certainly see that
there was a battle fought,

00:06:58.660 --> 00:07:00.050 align:middle line:90%
there was a conflict.

00:07:00.050 --> 00:07:03.060 align:middle line:84%
And at least in terms
of the history pages

00:07:03.060 --> 00:07:05.600 align:middle line:84%
we've all become
accustomed to, there's

00:07:05.600 --> 00:07:06.950 align:middle line:90%
a break in that narrative.

00:07:06.950 --> 00:07:09.460 align:middle line:84%
And here we are again,
Pluto and Capricorn.

00:07:09.460 --> 00:07:12.480 align:middle line:84%
And we're staring
down what seems

00:07:12.480 --> 00:07:17.200 align:middle line:84%
to be the synthesis of what
happened during the early 1500s

00:07:17.200 --> 00:07:19.820 align:middle line:90%
and during the 1770s.

00:07:19.820 --> 00:07:23.470 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:07:23.470 --> 00:07:30.411 align:middle line:90%
