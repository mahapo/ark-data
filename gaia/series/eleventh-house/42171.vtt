00:00:22.605 --> 00:00:24.480 align:middle line:84%
>>ROBERT PHOENIX: Hi,
this is Robert Phoenix.

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:26.170 align:middle line:84%
And welcome back to
The Eleventh House.

00:00:26.170 --> 00:00:29.380 align:middle line:84%
Today we're going
to get into aspects.

00:00:29.380 --> 00:00:31.630 align:middle line:84%
So we're going to be looking
at the five major aspects

00:00:31.630 --> 00:00:34.300 align:middle line:84%
and how they impact
the astrological chart

00:00:34.300 --> 00:00:35.870 align:middle line:90%
and the individual.

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:38.480 align:middle line:84%
We're going to look at them in
terms of both the natal chart

00:00:38.480 --> 00:00:40.460 align:middle line:90%
and also transits as well.

00:00:40.460 --> 00:00:42.790 align:middle line:84%
Before I jump into
aspects, I just

00:00:42.790 --> 00:00:45.350 align:middle line:84%
want to talk a little
bit about transits

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:49.790 align:middle line:84%
because I think it's an aspect
and a concept of astrology

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:53.160 align:middle line:84%
that a lot of people don't
really understand and may not

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:55.550 align:middle line:84%
really be able to
integrate into their charts

00:00:55.550 --> 00:00:58.220 align:middle line:84%
and into their lives in
ways that make sense.

00:00:58.220 --> 00:01:03.590 align:middle line:84%
And we get the word transit
from transitory or transitional.

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:05.950 align:middle line:84%
And it means that the
planets are actually

00:01:05.950 --> 00:01:07.460 align:middle line:90%
moving through space.

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:10.510 align:middle line:84%
They're moving through space
in terms of their relationship

00:01:10.510 --> 00:01:12.637 align:middle line:84%
to one another, but
they're also moving

00:01:12.637 --> 00:01:14.220 align:middle line:84%
through space in
terms of relationship

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:16.680 align:middle line:84%
to the planets in
our chart as well.

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:20.780 align:middle line:84%
And those transits can manifest
as trines, and sextiles,

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:22.630 align:middle line:84%
and oppositions,
and conjunctions,

00:01:22.630 --> 00:01:25.390 align:middle line:84%
all aspects that we're going
to look at as we go deeper

00:01:25.390 --> 00:01:27.700 align:middle line:84%
into today's episodes--
or today's episode.

00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:30.890 align:middle line:84%
But what I wanted to share with
you about aspects is that--

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:33.200 align:middle line:84%
or transits, rather,
is that transits

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:35.660 align:middle line:90%
aren't necessarily transitory.

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:40.610 align:middle line:84%
And this is my, and perhaps some
other astrologers' philosophy

00:01:40.610 --> 00:01:41.480 align:middle line:90%
on transits.

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:43.710 align:middle line:84%
In that, when they
happen, and they

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:46.680 align:middle line:84%
occur over a period
of time, that there's

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:49.420 align:middle line:84%
an opportunity for
us to integrate

00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:51.090 align:middle line:90%
those transits into our lives.

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:53.510 align:middle line:84%
So perhaps it will
be taking place

00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:55.690 align:middle line:84%
over a period of
days or weeks, which

00:01:55.690 --> 00:01:58.330 align:middle line:84%
might be the case with a
moon transit or a Mercury

00:01:58.330 --> 00:01:59.960 align:middle line:84%
transit, or a Venus
transit, I mean,

00:01:59.960 --> 00:02:03.210 align:middle line:84%
even a Mars transit to some
extent, Jupiter as well.

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:07.730 align:middle line:84%
But we get out to Saturn and
Uranus, and Neptune, and Pluto,

00:02:07.730 --> 00:02:09.509 align:middle line:90%
these transits take much longer.

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:13.060 align:middle line:84%
So they tend to have longer
term impacts on our lives,

00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:16.460 align:middle line:84%
both in terms of the
time and the schedule

00:02:16.460 --> 00:02:21.420 align:middle line:84%
and the longevity that
they have with the chart

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:23.880 align:middle line:84%
as part of the transit,
but also in terms

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:26.790 align:middle line:84%
of just the spiritual and
the astrological impact

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:29.140 align:middle line:84%
that they themselves
have with us.

00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:32.580 align:middle line:84%
So the idea with a transit
is to bring the transit home,

00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:34.800 align:middle line:84%
to make it your
own, to integrate it

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:38.430 align:middle line:84%
into your overall
being and make it

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:41.150 align:middle line:84%
kind of a holistic
enterprise and activity.

00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:43.450 align:middle line:84%
And how you do that,
in a lot of ways,

00:02:43.450 --> 00:02:46.730 align:middle line:84%
is dependent upon your character
type or your astrological type.

00:02:46.730 --> 00:02:49.620 align:middle line:84%
But I think one of the
more constructive ways

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:52.190 align:middle line:84%
of making an aspect real or
really owning it, and bringing

00:02:52.190 --> 00:02:54.420 align:middle line:84%
it home, is to make it
manifest, to bring it

00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:55.730 align:middle line:90%
into the real world.

00:02:55.730 --> 00:02:58.230 align:middle line:84%
And you can do that with
art, and creativity,

00:02:58.230 --> 00:03:02.560 align:middle line:84%
and making something physical,
a physical kind of manifestation

00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:04.580 align:middle line:84%
of whatever it is that
you're going through.

00:03:04.580 --> 00:03:06.550 align:middle line:84%
So if you're going
through a period

00:03:06.550 --> 00:03:10.800 align:middle line:84%
where perhaps Neptune is
trining Mercury in your life,

00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:12.600 align:middle line:84%
maybe you want to
write some poetry.

00:03:12.600 --> 00:03:14.370 align:middle line:84%
Maybe you want to
write a fictional novel

00:03:14.370 --> 00:03:15.289 align:middle line:90%
during that time.

00:03:15.289 --> 00:03:16.580 align:middle line:90%
Maybe you want to write a play.

00:03:16.580 --> 00:03:18.370 align:middle line:84%
Maybe you want to get
into freestyle rap.

00:03:18.370 --> 00:03:20.920 align:middle line:84%
Whatever that thing
is, make it happen,

00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:22.340 align:middle line:90%
and make a record of it.

00:03:22.340 --> 00:03:22.840 align:middle line:90%
Why?

00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:26.140 align:middle line:84%
Because it's a n-- it's
a n-- mnemonic device.

00:03:26.140 --> 00:03:28.140 align:middle line:84%
I always have a hard time
pronouncing that word.

00:03:28.140 --> 00:03:30.270 align:middle line:84%
It's a mnemonic
device, which allows

00:03:30.270 --> 00:03:32.320 align:middle line:84%
you to remember what
you've gone through,

00:03:32.320 --> 00:03:37.470 align:middle line:84%
but it also gives
you this piece that's

00:03:37.470 --> 00:03:39.255 align:middle line:84%
a record of what
you've experienced.

00:03:39.255 --> 00:03:40.880 align:middle line:84%
So it operates on
two different levels.

00:03:40.880 --> 00:03:43.310 align:middle line:84%
That's one way you can
bring an aspect home.

00:03:43.310 --> 00:03:45.447 align:middle line:84%
Another way is to be
really conscious of it

00:03:45.447 --> 00:03:47.280 align:middle line:84%
and be really conscious
of the energy that's

00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:48.690 align:middle line:90%
flowing in your life.

00:03:48.690 --> 00:03:51.090 align:middle line:84%
And it's easier to
do this when you're

00:03:51.090 --> 00:03:54.360 align:middle line:84%
engaging with a harmonious
aspect like a sextile,

00:03:54.360 --> 00:03:56.630 align:middle line:84%
or a trine, and even
at times conjunctions,

00:03:56.630 --> 00:03:59.370 align:middle line:84%
although conjunctions
can be tricky as well.

00:03:59.370 --> 00:04:02.359 align:middle line:84%
But you can be really conscious
and aware that the energy is

00:04:02.359 --> 00:04:03.400 align:middle line:90%
moving through your life.

00:04:03.400 --> 00:04:07.050 align:middle line:84%
I'll give an example for me,
what happened during the time

00:04:07.050 --> 00:04:09.830 align:middle line:84%
when Neptune was trining
Mercury, and also

00:04:09.830 --> 00:04:10.970 align:middle line:90%
Venus in my life.

00:04:10.970 --> 00:04:13.280 align:middle line:84%
That was a time when
Neptune was in Aquarius,

00:04:13.280 --> 00:04:15.500 align:middle line:84%
it was transiting
my third house,

00:04:15.500 --> 00:04:19.420 align:middle line:84%
and it was trining Mercury and
also Venus in my 11th house.

00:04:19.420 --> 00:04:22.029 align:middle line:84%
And during that cycle
and during that phase

00:04:22.029 --> 00:04:23.680 align:middle line:84%
I was doing a lot
of tarot reading.

00:04:23.680 --> 00:04:25.270 align:middle line:84%
I was doing a lot
of psychic work.

00:04:25.270 --> 00:04:27.970 align:middle line:84%
And I was also feeling really
compassionate towards people.

00:04:27.970 --> 00:04:29.050 align:middle line:90%
I wanted to help people.

00:04:29.050 --> 00:04:32.950 align:middle line:84%
And I wanted this-- the tarot
and some of the psychic work

00:04:32.950 --> 00:04:35.950 align:middle line:84%
to be used as a
tool to help people.

00:04:35.950 --> 00:04:38.410 align:middle line:84%
So I was really aware of
that aspect taking place.

00:04:38.410 --> 00:04:40.260 align:middle line:84%
And I pushed it
during that time.

00:04:40.260 --> 00:04:43.620 align:middle line:84%
And I integrated it, obviously,
because I'm still doing it.

00:04:43.620 --> 00:04:45.490 align:middle line:84%
And I'm standing in
front of a camera right

00:04:45.490 --> 00:04:46.790 align:middle line:84%
now sharing the
experience with you

00:04:46.790 --> 00:04:48.920 align:middle line:84%
and taking it to a different
level with astrology.

00:04:48.920 --> 00:04:50.610 align:middle line:84%
So that's one way
that you can do--

00:04:50.610 --> 00:04:52.995 align:middle line:84%
you can become aware of
the aspect and the transit

00:04:52.995 --> 00:04:54.070 align:middle line:90%
and really bring it home.

00:04:54.070 --> 00:04:56.865 align:middle line:84%
Now, sometimes transits
can be difficult,

00:04:56.865 --> 00:04:58.990 align:middle line:84%
especially when you're
dealing with Pluto transits,

00:04:58.990 --> 00:05:03.080 align:middle line:84%
or you're dealing with Neptune
transits, certain Uranus

00:05:03.080 --> 00:05:06.620 align:middle line:84%
transits, and quite often
even with Saturn transits.

00:05:06.620 --> 00:05:08.790 align:middle line:84%
And when we get into
the heavy transits,

00:05:08.790 --> 00:05:11.270 align:middle line:84%
when we get into the
transpersonal planets

00:05:11.270 --> 00:05:13.540 align:middle line:84%
and they're squaring
or opposing or they're

00:05:13.540 --> 00:05:16.380 align:middle line:84%
conjuncting certain
aspects in our chart,

00:05:16.380 --> 00:05:19.950 align:middle line:90%
sometimes we just can't hold on.

00:05:19.950 --> 00:05:21.120 align:middle line:90%
We have to let go.

00:05:21.120 --> 00:05:25.740 align:middle line:84%
We have to surrender because
there's a greater plan,

00:05:25.740 --> 00:05:28.660 align:middle line:84%
there's a greater evolution,
there's a greater blueprint

00:05:28.660 --> 00:05:32.610 align:middle line:84%
that wants to come through in
your life as a result of this.

00:05:32.610 --> 00:05:35.090 align:middle line:84%
So I'm feeling pretty
confessional today.

00:05:35.090 --> 00:05:37.440 align:middle line:84%
So I'll share with you
another example in my life

00:05:37.440 --> 00:05:38.830 align:middle line:90%
when this happened.

00:05:38.830 --> 00:05:41.970 align:middle line:90%
And it was right around 2007.

00:05:41.970 --> 00:05:46.500 align:middle line:84%
And during that time, Saturn was
moving through my ninth house.

00:05:46.500 --> 00:05:48.940 align:middle line:84%
And I have Pluto
conjuncting my mid heaven.

00:05:48.940 --> 00:05:51.740 align:middle line:84%
And at that time Saturn
conjuncted my Pluto.

00:05:51.740 --> 00:05:54.890 align:middle line:84%
And right at that time,
almost simultaneously,

00:05:54.890 --> 00:05:59.440 align:middle line:84%
I lost my corporate gig
because I was redundant,

00:05:59.440 --> 00:06:02.610 align:middle line:84%
I got a divorce,
and my father died.

00:06:02.610 --> 00:06:04.240 align:middle line:84%
This was Saturn
coming over my Pluto.

00:06:04.240 --> 00:06:05.880 align:middle line:90%
It's a major cycle.

00:06:05.880 --> 00:06:09.950 align:middle line:84%
It's a 30 year cycle, about
a 28 to 30 year cycle.

00:06:09.950 --> 00:06:13.560 align:middle line:84%
And it came across my Pluto
and it changed my life

00:06:13.560 --> 00:06:15.330 align:middle line:90%
in a really profound way.

00:06:15.330 --> 00:06:19.470 align:middle line:84%
And so I had this intense
kind of wave of loss.

00:06:19.470 --> 00:06:21.390 align:middle line:84%
But on the other
side of that, Saturn

00:06:21.390 --> 00:06:23.610 align:middle line:84%
came into my tenth
house, and I started

00:06:23.610 --> 00:06:27.140 align:middle line:84%
to work on my astrological blog,
and it became fairly popular,

00:06:27.140 --> 00:06:30.080 align:middle line:84%
and I started my radio show,
and eventually it let me here

00:06:30.080 --> 00:06:32.160 align:middle line:84%
to the studios of Gaiam
TV, where I'm doing this.

00:06:32.160 --> 00:06:34.190 align:middle line:90%
So I had to let go of something.

00:06:34.190 --> 00:06:38.030 align:middle line:84%
I had to push off from the shore
when Saturn crossed my Pluto.

00:06:38.030 --> 00:06:40.850 align:middle line:84%
But when I did, something
else was there to await me.

00:06:40.850 --> 00:06:42.350 align:middle line:84%
And that's quite
often the case when

00:06:42.350 --> 00:06:44.620 align:middle line:84%
we go through very
intense transits.

00:06:44.620 --> 00:06:47.030 align:middle line:84%
So my advice to you,
if you're struggling

00:06:47.030 --> 00:06:50.286 align:middle line:84%
with a Pluto square
or a Pluto opposition,

00:06:50.286 --> 00:06:52.660 align:middle line:84%
or there's something happening
with Saturn in your chart,

00:06:52.660 --> 00:06:56.150 align:middle line:84%
to try to lighten your load,
let go of some personal baggage.

00:06:56.150 --> 00:06:59.180 align:middle line:84%
Try to give up something that's
holding you down or keeping you

00:06:59.180 --> 00:06:59.920 align:middle line:90%
back.

00:06:59.920 --> 00:07:02.990 align:middle line:84%
It could be a
pattern, or a habit,

00:07:02.990 --> 00:07:07.000 align:middle line:84%
or an addiction, something
that can keep you

00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:11.180 align:middle line:84%
from really being able
to gracefully let go,

00:07:11.180 --> 00:07:14.460 align:middle line:84%
and dissolve, and move with
the energy in your life.

00:07:14.460 --> 00:07:17.900 align:middle line:84%
So those are some ideas,
and some understanding,

00:07:17.900 --> 00:07:20.280 align:middle line:84%
and some experiences that
I've had with transits,

00:07:20.280 --> 00:07:21.965 align:middle line:90%
and it might be helpful for you.

00:07:21.965 --> 00:07:24.960 align:middle line:84%
All right, so let's get
into the aspects themselves.

00:07:24.960 --> 00:07:28.510 align:middle line:84%
And I tend to work with
the five major aspects.

00:07:28.510 --> 00:07:31.400 align:middle line:84%
There are minor aspects
like semisextiles,

00:07:31.400 --> 00:07:35.000 align:middle line:84%
and quinconxes, and
inconjunctions, quintiles,

00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:36.230 align:middle line:90%
and bi-quintiles.

00:07:36.230 --> 00:07:38.970 align:middle line:84%
I tend to pay attention to
quintiles and bi-quintiles

00:07:38.970 --> 00:07:40.470 align:middle line:84%
because I think
they're interesting.

00:07:40.470 --> 00:07:42.125 align:middle line:84%
But these are the
five major aspects.

00:07:42.125 --> 00:07:44.880 align:middle line:84%
And if you really
understand them,

00:07:44.880 --> 00:07:47.580 align:middle line:84%
and you can understand
them within the dynamics

00:07:47.580 --> 00:07:49.150 align:middle line:84%
of the dance of the
chart, you really

00:07:49.150 --> 00:07:52.500 align:middle line:84%
don't need anything else,
especially if you're

00:07:52.500 --> 00:07:54.290 align:middle line:84%
trying to understand
your own chart.

00:07:54.290 --> 00:07:56.840 align:middle line:84%
Get a good handle on
these five aspects.

00:07:56.840 --> 00:07:59.477 align:middle line:84%
Or if you're reading
for somebody else,

00:07:59.477 --> 00:08:01.810 align:middle line:84%
try to get a good handle on
them and really ground them,

00:08:01.810 --> 00:08:04.060 align:middle line:84%
and go as deep as
you can, so that when

00:08:04.060 --> 00:08:09.280 align:middle line:84%
you start to get into the,
what I would call the deeper

00:08:09.280 --> 00:08:12.800 align:middle line:84%
flow of the reading, things
become much more intuitive.

00:08:12.800 --> 00:08:15.240 align:middle line:84%
And you can begin to
make some sort of leaps

00:08:15.240 --> 00:08:17.710 align:middle line:84%
and some sort of
interesting connections

00:08:17.710 --> 00:08:21.220 align:middle line:84%
as a result of really
understanding these aspects.

00:08:21.220 --> 00:08:22.470 align:middle line:90%
Excuse me.

00:08:22.470 --> 00:08:24.360 align:middle line:90%
So, let's get into them.

00:08:24.360 --> 00:08:26.350 align:middle line:84%
Let's start off
with the sextile.

00:08:26.350 --> 00:08:27.800 align:middle line:90%
It's a 60 degree aspect.

00:08:27.800 --> 00:08:29.530 align:middle line:84%
Here we have the
sun and the moon.

00:08:29.530 --> 00:08:32.960 align:middle line:84%
And in terms of
sextile and trines,

00:08:32.960 --> 00:08:36.049 align:middle line:84%
they tend to be what we
call benefic, or positive,

00:08:36.049 --> 00:08:38.530 align:middle line:90%
or flowing, or easy aspects.

00:08:38.530 --> 00:08:42.409 align:middle line:84%
They allow us to tap into the
energy between two planets

00:08:42.409 --> 00:08:48.230 align:middle line:84%
in a fairly graceful
and non challenging way.

00:08:48.230 --> 00:08:53.020 align:middle line:84%
And the sextiles generally
tend to be quicker

00:08:53.020 --> 00:08:55.569 align:middle line:84%
in some ways than the
trines because they're

00:08:55.569 --> 00:08:57.110 align:middle line:84%
shorter in terms of
angle and degree.

00:08:57.110 --> 00:08:58.160 align:middle line:90%
They happen quicker.

00:08:58.160 --> 00:09:01.090 align:middle line:84%
But also with
sextiles, you'll find

00:09:01.090 --> 00:09:03.620 align:middle line:84%
that there is a
component to them that

00:09:03.620 --> 00:09:09.440 align:middle line:84%
are-- it's like having the
opportunity to experience

00:09:09.440 --> 00:09:13.130 align:middle line:84%
a new technique, or a new skill,
or new gift inside the matrix.

00:09:13.130 --> 00:09:15.100 align:middle line:84%
But most the time
with a sextile,

00:09:15.100 --> 00:09:17.680 align:middle line:84%
you're dealing
with elements that

00:09:17.680 --> 00:09:19.620 align:middle line:90%
are copacetic with one another.

00:09:19.620 --> 00:09:24.140 align:middle line:84%
So for instance, in this chart
let's say the sun is in Taurus,

00:09:24.140 --> 00:09:27.870 align:middle line:84%
maybe the moon here is over
here in the sign of Cancer.

00:09:27.870 --> 00:09:31.500 align:middle line:84%
So we have earth and
water playing together.

00:09:31.500 --> 00:09:34.210 align:middle line:84%
Or perhaps the sun
is in Aries and then

00:09:34.210 --> 00:09:37.930 align:middle line:84%
the moon can be in Gemini
so we have fire and air.

00:09:37.930 --> 00:09:40.660 align:middle line:84%
So it's usually working with
two compatible elements,

00:09:40.660 --> 00:09:44.315 align:middle line:84%
but generally speaking,
in different elements.

00:09:44.315 --> 00:09:46.660 align:middle line:84%
Right, they're compatible,
but they're are different.

00:09:46.660 --> 00:09:48.870 align:middle line:84%
So, the trine, on
the other hand,

00:09:48.870 --> 00:09:51.930 align:middle line:84%
generally is two elements
within the same trine.

00:09:51.930 --> 00:09:54.370 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes-- or in
the same element.

00:09:54.370 --> 00:09:57.460 align:middle line:84%
For instance, the
sun could be in Libra

00:09:57.460 --> 00:10:00.710 align:middle line:84%
and the moon could be
over here in Aquarius.

00:10:00.710 --> 00:10:03.489 align:middle line:84%
So it would be two air
signs at a 120 degree angle.

00:10:03.489 --> 00:10:05.280 align:middle line:84%
Every now and then,
you can get out of sign

00:10:05.280 --> 00:10:08.760 align:middle line:84%
sextiles-- I'm sorry,
out of element sextiles,

00:10:08.760 --> 00:10:10.310 align:middle line:90%
but it's pretty rare.

00:10:10.310 --> 00:10:11.890 align:middle line:84%
So this-- or out
of element trines,

00:10:11.890 --> 00:10:13.170 align:middle line:90%
but they're both pretty rare.

00:10:13.170 --> 00:10:15.340 align:middle line:84%
But with the sextile,
though, what the sextile

00:10:15.340 --> 00:10:18.740 align:middle line:84%
allows you to do,
it allows you to tap

00:10:18.740 --> 00:10:23.945 align:middle line:84%
into a new way of working with
energy in a way that's flowing.

00:10:23.945 --> 00:10:27.750 align:middle line:84%
It allows you to combine two
different elements, usually

00:10:27.750 --> 00:10:31.720 align:middle line:84%
fire and air or earth and
water together, combine them,

00:10:31.720 --> 00:10:34.140 align:middle line:84%
and come up with
interesting solutions.

00:10:34.140 --> 00:10:38.680 align:middle line:84%
Sextiles allow the individual
to learn and grow on the fly.

00:10:38.680 --> 00:10:40.800 align:middle line:84%
Now, you can have
them also in a chart,

00:10:40.800 --> 00:10:42.550 align:middle line:84%
you can have planets
sextiling your chart.

00:10:42.550 --> 00:10:44.258 align:middle line:84%
You can have trines
sextiling your chart.

00:10:44.258 --> 00:10:46.280 align:middle line:84%
Doesn't have to be
based on transits.

00:10:46.280 --> 00:10:51.640 align:middle line:84%
But generally speaking, the
trine is an energy and an angle

00:10:51.640 --> 00:10:55.270 align:middle line:84%
that you have worked with
at some point in time

00:10:55.270 --> 00:10:56.520 align:middle line:90%
prior to this lifetime.

00:10:56.520 --> 00:10:58.590 align:middle line:84%
At least that's my
understanding of it.

00:10:58.590 --> 00:11:00.740 align:middle line:90%
Or that's my experience with it.

00:11:00.740 --> 00:11:03.910 align:middle line:84%
And as a result, you
are born with a trine.

00:11:03.910 --> 00:11:07.180 align:middle line:84%
It's like a tried and true
strategy, and a friend

00:11:07.180 --> 00:11:10.810 align:middle line:84%
that you can tap into
again, and again, and again.

00:11:10.810 --> 00:11:12.900 align:middle line:84%
The sextile is
something that you're

00:11:12.900 --> 00:11:15.360 align:middle line:90%
learning about and growing with.

00:11:15.360 --> 00:11:20.935 align:middle line:84%
Now, what happens is, at times,
that these energies are so easy

00:11:20.935 --> 00:11:24.180 align:middle line:84%
and so flowing that you
may not be able to-- you

00:11:24.180 --> 00:11:25.720 align:middle line:90%
may take them for granted.

00:11:25.720 --> 00:11:30.020 align:middle line:84%
And as a result, there's
an old axiom which

00:11:30.020 --> 00:11:32.970 align:middle line:84%
is if you don't use
it, you lose it.

00:11:32.970 --> 00:11:35.160 align:middle line:84%
And that can be said
of both of these.

00:11:35.160 --> 00:11:37.530 align:middle line:84%
So you don't want to
take these energies

00:11:37.530 --> 00:11:41.070 align:middle line:84%
for granted in your chart
or when they're taking place

00:11:41.070 --> 00:11:42.280 align:middle line:90%
in terms of their transits.

00:11:42.280 --> 00:11:45.450 align:middle line:84%
You need to be able to tap
into them, work with them,

00:11:45.450 --> 00:11:47.950 align:middle line:84%
be conscious of
them, and make sure

00:11:47.950 --> 00:11:50.680 align:middle line:84%
that you are expressing
them and circulating

00:11:50.680 --> 00:11:54.270 align:middle line:84%
the energy through your
chart and through your life.

00:11:54.270 --> 00:11:57.360 align:middle line:90%
Let's move over to the squares.

00:11:57.360 --> 00:11:59.550 align:middle line:90%
Squares are really interesting.

00:11:59.550 --> 00:12:01.530 align:middle line:90%
They're 90 degree angles.

00:12:01.530 --> 00:12:04.380 align:middle line:84%
And squares are often
considered difficult.

00:12:04.380 --> 00:12:09.480 align:middle line:84%
If somebody says, oh man, I've
got Uranus squaring my Neptune

00:12:09.480 --> 00:12:12.010 align:middle line:84%
right now, they're
basically saying

00:12:12.010 --> 00:12:13.940 align:middle line:84%
that they're going
through a hard time,

00:12:13.940 --> 00:12:16.970 align:middle line:84%
that the energy
is happening here

00:12:16.970 --> 00:12:19.850 align:middle line:90%
at kind of a-- it's not as easy.

00:12:19.850 --> 00:12:22.110 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't flow
like the sextile.

00:12:22.110 --> 00:12:23.700 align:middle line:90%
It doesn't flow like the trine.

00:12:23.700 --> 00:12:24.420 align:middle line:90%
It's harder.

00:12:24.420 --> 00:12:26.975 align:middle line:84%
It's coming here
almost at a triangle.

00:12:26.975 --> 00:12:28.600 align:middle line:84%
In fact, if you were
to build this out,

00:12:28.600 --> 00:12:30.620 align:middle line:84%
you could build a
t-square out of this.

00:12:30.620 --> 00:12:33.130 align:middle line:90%
But so, it's a 90 degree angle.

00:12:33.130 --> 00:12:37.160 align:middle line:84%
And how I see squares,
what I'd liken a square to

00:12:37.160 --> 00:12:39.930 align:middle line:90%
is I liken it to body building.

00:12:39.930 --> 00:12:42.540 align:middle line:84%
And if you were to
take a dumbbell,

00:12:42.540 --> 00:12:46.170 align:middle line:84%
and hold the dumbbell up, and
bring it to a 90 degree angle

00:12:46.170 --> 00:12:48.260 align:middle line:84%
here with your arm,
which would basically

00:12:48.260 --> 00:12:50.410 align:middle line:84%
be a mirror of the
square, what you would do

00:12:50.410 --> 00:12:52.090 align:middle line:84%
is you would build
up your bicep.

00:12:52.090 --> 00:12:54.480 align:middle line:84%
You would build up
muscle because you

00:12:54.480 --> 00:12:55.820 align:middle line:90%
would have resistance.

00:12:55.820 --> 00:12:58.450 align:middle line:84%
And squares bring you
resistance in your life.

00:12:58.450 --> 00:13:00.680 align:middle line:84%
And they're there to
help you get stronger.

00:13:00.680 --> 00:13:02.110 align:middle line:90%
They're not a curse.

00:13:02.110 --> 00:13:04.430 align:middle line:84%
They're not something
that is hard,

00:13:04.430 --> 00:13:08.250 align:middle line:84%
that is some sort of karmic
debt that you have to go through

00:13:08.250 --> 00:13:10.385 align:middle line:90%
and you have to pay.

00:13:10.385 --> 00:13:15.090 align:middle line:84%
These squares are taking place
because as individuals, we

00:13:15.090 --> 00:13:15.810 align:middle line:90%
need to grow.

00:13:15.810 --> 00:13:19.940 align:middle line:84%
And sometimes we have to
have conditions in our lives

00:13:19.940 --> 00:13:21.230 align:middle line:90%
that challenge us.

00:13:21.230 --> 00:13:24.100 align:middle line:84%
We have to break
down structures,

00:13:24.100 --> 00:13:26.140 align:middle line:84%
just like we break down
muscle, and then we

00:13:26.140 --> 00:13:27.870 align:middle line:90%
have to build it back up.

00:13:27.870 --> 00:13:29.460 align:middle line:90%
That's part of the square.

00:13:29.460 --> 00:13:32.650 align:middle line:84%
And right now,
there are people who

00:13:32.650 --> 00:13:35.760 align:middle line:84%
have Saturn in
Capricorn who are going

00:13:35.760 --> 00:13:38.280 align:middle line:84%
through the Uranus
squared to it.

00:13:38.280 --> 00:13:41.240 align:middle line:84%
And it's a little bit
challenging because there's

00:13:41.240 --> 00:13:43.890 align:middle line:84%
kind of an element of
restlessness to that.

00:13:43.890 --> 00:13:48.780 align:middle line:84%
But again, if we don't have
the squares in our lives,

00:13:48.780 --> 00:13:50.000 align:middle line:90%
we're not going to grow.

00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:53.390 align:middle line:84%
We know-- we can-- and
I've seen this in charts.

00:13:53.390 --> 00:13:55.290 align:middle line:84%
I've seen charts
where people have

00:13:55.290 --> 00:13:56.960 align:middle line:84%
very little squares
in their charts.

00:13:56.960 --> 00:13:59.850 align:middle line:84%
And you would think, oh wow,
what a great incarnation.

00:13:59.850 --> 00:14:02.140 align:middle line:84%
You must have done really
well in a past life

00:14:02.140 --> 00:14:06.459 align:middle line:84%
because you don't have the labor
of going through these squares.

00:14:06.459 --> 00:14:08.750 align:middle line:84%
But when you look at their
charts and you talk to them,

00:14:08.750 --> 00:14:11.727 align:middle line:84%
sometimes they can really be
lost because they don't have

00:14:11.727 --> 00:14:13.560 align:middle line:84%
the resistance, they
don't have the pressure

00:14:13.560 --> 00:14:16.424 align:middle line:84%
of the air coming
against the wing.

00:14:16.424 --> 00:14:18.590 align:middle line:84%
Because if we don't have
that, we can't really grow,

00:14:18.590 --> 00:14:20.000 align:middle line:90%
we can't really fly.

00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:20.810 align:middle line:90%
So that's a square.

00:14:20.810 --> 00:14:22.980 align:middle line:90%
It's a 90 degree angle.

00:14:22.980 --> 00:14:24.810 align:middle line:84%
And here we have
the conjunction.

00:14:24.810 --> 00:14:27.310 align:middle line:84%
Now, conjunctions are
interesting because they

00:14:27.310 --> 00:14:30.710 align:middle line:84%
can be both positive,
theoretically, and negative.

00:14:30.710 --> 00:14:33.850 align:middle line:84%
And conjunctions are
usually within five degrees.

00:14:33.850 --> 00:14:36.450 align:middle line:84%
That's the sweet spot
of the conjunction.

00:14:36.450 --> 00:14:38.120 align:middle line:84%
Now, there are
people that will read

00:14:38.120 --> 00:14:40.279 align:middle line:90%
a conjunction for 10 degrees.

00:14:40.279 --> 00:14:41.820 align:middle line:84%
There are other
people that will read

00:14:41.820 --> 00:14:44.960 align:middle line:84%
a conjunction for
10 plus degrees.

00:14:44.960 --> 00:14:48.540 align:middle line:84%
Now, I think that when
a planet is in one sign

00:14:48.540 --> 00:14:51.970 align:middle line:84%
and it has the
potential of contacting

00:14:51.970 --> 00:14:54.640 align:middle line:84%
another plan in
the same sign it is

00:14:54.640 --> 00:14:59.350 align:middle line:84%
going to have an impact whether
it's 30 degrees, 29 degrees, 28

00:14:59.350 --> 00:15:02.690 align:middle line:90%
degrees, 15 degrees, 10 degrees.

00:15:02.690 --> 00:15:06.590 align:middle line:84%
It is going to have
some kind of impact

00:15:06.590 --> 00:15:08.230 align:middle line:90%
in terms of the conjunction.

00:15:08.230 --> 00:15:13.860 align:middle line:84%
It can be super wide, but the
closer it gets, obviously,

00:15:13.860 --> 00:15:16.650 align:middle line:84%
the more impact
it's going to have.

00:15:16.650 --> 00:15:21.150 align:middle line:84%
Now, there are times when we
can have a sun Mars conjunction.

00:15:21.150 --> 00:15:22.320 align:middle line:90%
Now, here it's moon sun.

00:15:22.320 --> 00:15:23.840 align:middle line:84%
They use the moon
for all of these.

00:15:23.840 --> 00:15:25.440 align:middle line:84%
We could have a sun
Mars conjunction.

00:15:25.440 --> 00:15:27.710 align:middle line:84%
And if that sun
Mars conjunction is

00:15:27.710 --> 00:15:30.880 align:middle line:84%
within five degrees, five--
between five to 10 degrees--

00:15:30.880 --> 00:15:33.040 align:middle line:84%
that's a really
dynamic conjunction.

00:15:33.040 --> 00:15:36.380 align:middle line:84%
You're basically marrying the
planet of will and expression

00:15:36.380 --> 00:15:37.260 align:middle line:90%
with the sun.

00:15:37.260 --> 00:15:41.015 align:middle line:84%
It's really energetic, it's
really alive and invigorating.

00:15:41.015 --> 00:15:43.580 align:middle line:84%
And that individual
has a lot a life

00:15:43.580 --> 00:15:45.180 align:middle line:90%
force that they can tap into.

00:15:45.180 --> 00:15:47.270 align:middle line:84%
But let's just
say that that Mars

00:15:47.270 --> 00:15:50.000 align:middle line:84%
gets within four degrees,
three degrees, two degrees.

00:15:50.000 --> 00:15:52.900 align:middle line:84%
Now we have the sun and
Mars coming together

00:15:52.900 --> 00:15:54.760 align:middle line:90%
in a really tight conjunction.

00:15:54.760 --> 00:15:56.670 align:middle line:84%
And what was an
abundance of energy

00:15:56.670 --> 00:16:00.840 align:middle line:84%
before becomes almost
too much energy,

00:16:00.840 --> 00:16:03.860 align:middle line:84%
and somebody who can fly
off the handle, somebody

00:16:03.860 --> 00:16:09.010 align:middle line:84%
who has no self control, has no
ability to channel their will.

00:16:09.010 --> 00:16:10.550 align:middle line:90%
They're all energy.

00:16:10.550 --> 00:16:11.410 align:middle line:90%
They're all yang.

00:16:11.410 --> 00:16:12.370 align:middle line:90%
They're all fire.

00:16:12.370 --> 00:16:15.390 align:middle line:84%
And that's when the conjunction
becomes challenging.

00:16:15.390 --> 00:16:18.720 align:middle line:84%
Now, I've seen this,
also, with Mercury

00:16:18.720 --> 00:16:20.050 align:middle line:90%
in conjunction with the sun.

00:16:20.050 --> 00:16:22.620 align:middle line:84%
When you get past four
degrees with Mercury,

00:16:22.620 --> 00:16:25.165 align:middle line:84%
sometimes the individual
thinks too quickly, they

00:16:25.165 --> 00:16:27.710 align:middle line:84%
don't check their work, they
don't check their mistakes.

00:16:27.710 --> 00:16:29.960 align:middle line:84%
There can also be learning
and speech disabilities

00:16:29.960 --> 00:16:33.250 align:middle line:84%
or difficulties with Mercury
conjunct the sun too close.

00:16:33.250 --> 00:16:36.130 align:middle line:84%
So you get too close to a
planet and the conjunction

00:16:36.130 --> 00:16:37.660 align:middle line:90%
becomes intense.

00:16:37.660 --> 00:16:40.610 align:middle line:84%
And there can be a
crisis in the individual.

00:16:40.610 --> 00:16:44.300 align:middle line:84%
And if it backs off a little
bit and is further out,

00:16:44.300 --> 00:16:47.980 align:middle line:84%
it can actually be a
complement to that planet

00:16:47.980 --> 00:16:49.660 align:middle line:90%
that's conjuncting.

00:16:49.660 --> 00:16:52.250 align:middle line:84%
So it all depends on how
close that planet is.

00:16:52.250 --> 00:16:55.370 align:middle line:84%
Now, in terms of
transits, that could

00:16:55.370 --> 00:16:57.360 align:middle line:90%
be a really interesting time.

00:16:57.360 --> 00:16:59.900 align:middle line:84%
I talked about the conjunction
between Saturn and the Pluto

00:16:59.900 --> 00:17:01.220 align:middle line:90%
in my own chart.

00:17:01.220 --> 00:17:03.080 align:middle line:84%
There could be an
experience that you're

00:17:03.080 --> 00:17:06.260 align:middle line:84%
having your own life with a
conjunction that's taking place

00:17:06.260 --> 00:17:08.829 align:middle line:84%
right now and you want
to pay attention to it.

00:17:08.829 --> 00:17:10.960 align:middle line:84%
Especially if it's Saturn,
because when Saturn

00:17:10.960 --> 00:17:14.460 align:middle line:84%
comes around and conjuncts
any planet in your chart,

00:17:14.460 --> 00:17:17.819 align:middle line:84%
it is resetting your
relationship to that planet.

00:17:17.819 --> 00:17:20.349 align:middle line:84%
So Saturn conjuncts
Venus, it's having

00:17:20.349 --> 00:17:22.859 align:middle line:84%
a reset with all
your relationships.

00:17:22.859 --> 00:17:25.790 align:middle line:84%
Because Saturn won't be coming
through and touching that Venus

00:17:25.790 --> 00:17:27.730 align:middle line:90%
again for another 28 years.

00:17:27.730 --> 00:17:28.310 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:17:28.310 --> 00:17:30.600 align:middle line:84%
So pay attention to
your conjunctions.

00:17:30.600 --> 00:17:34.830 align:middle line:84%
They're important, both natally
and in terms of transits.

00:17:34.830 --> 00:17:38.660 align:middle line:84%
That brings us to the
final aspect of the five

00:17:38.660 --> 00:17:41.000 align:middle line:84%
large aspects, or the
five major aspects.

00:17:41.000 --> 00:17:42.010 align:middle line:90%
That's the opposition.

00:17:42.010 --> 00:17:47.301 align:middle line:84%
The opposition is an 80
degree-- 180 degree angle.

00:17:47.301 --> 00:17:49.800 align:middle line:84%
It's not really an angle, it's
just an 180 degree opposition

00:17:49.800 --> 00:17:51.910 align:middle line:84%
between one planet
and the other.

00:17:51.910 --> 00:17:54.010 align:middle line:90%
Here it's the moon and Saturn.

00:17:54.010 --> 00:17:56.260 align:middle line:84%
And oppositions are
a little bit tricky

00:17:56.260 --> 00:18:00.840 align:middle line:84%
because there is kind an off
on energy with oppositions.

00:18:00.840 --> 00:18:04.140 align:middle line:84%
There's a pulsation that
takes place within the chart.

00:18:04.140 --> 00:18:07.430 align:middle line:84%
A person can run hot and
cold with oppositions.

00:18:07.430 --> 00:18:10.120 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes they're over here on
this side of the opposition.

00:18:10.120 --> 00:18:13.070 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes they're on the
other side of the opposition.

00:18:13.070 --> 00:18:16.640 align:middle line:84%
It can indicate that they
have a difficulty bringing

00:18:16.640 --> 00:18:18.990 align:middle line:84%
different parts of
their lives together.

00:18:18.990 --> 00:18:21.110 align:middle line:84%
For instance, let's
say somebody has

00:18:21.110 --> 00:18:23.580 align:middle line:84%
the sun up in the
10th house over here,

00:18:23.580 --> 00:18:26.570 align:middle line:84%
and then down here in the fourth
house they may have Saturn.

00:18:26.570 --> 00:18:28.680 align:middle line:84%
So they'd have a
Saturn sun opposition.

00:18:28.680 --> 00:18:31.150 align:middle line:84%
So they may have a really
strong burden in the home,

00:18:31.150 --> 00:18:33.530 align:middle line:84%
and a lot of
responsibility in the home.

00:18:33.530 --> 00:18:36.220 align:middle line:84%
And they really need to
be up in the 10th house.

00:18:36.220 --> 00:18:38.840 align:middle line:84%
And they really need to be
focusing on their career

00:18:38.840 --> 00:18:40.680 align:middle line:84%
and manifesting who
they are in the world,

00:18:40.680 --> 00:18:42.560 align:middle line:84%
but Saturn always
brings them back

00:18:42.560 --> 00:18:44.650 align:middle line:84%
to the challenge,
and the struggle,

00:18:44.650 --> 00:18:48.460 align:middle line:84%
and the gravity that
keeps them at home.

00:18:48.460 --> 00:18:52.120 align:middle line:84%
And that is the key
to the opposition.

00:18:52.120 --> 00:18:55.830 align:middle line:84%
You got to figure out
how to bring these two

00:18:55.830 --> 00:18:58.390 align:middle line:84%
disparate worlds, or these
two disparate poles together.

00:18:58.390 --> 00:19:00.636 align:middle line:84%
Now, I have a theory
about oppositions

00:19:00.636 --> 00:19:01.760 align:middle line:90%
and it's kind of like this.

00:19:01.760 --> 00:19:04.780 align:middle line:84%
We see the opposition
here in 2D, right?

00:19:04.780 --> 00:19:05.990 align:middle line:90%
It's two dimensional.

00:19:05.990 --> 00:19:11.400 align:middle line:84%
So we just see it as some
kind of disparity or polarity

00:19:11.400 --> 00:19:13.217 align:middle line:84%
that somehow we have
to make a bridge to.

00:19:13.217 --> 00:19:15.175 align:middle line:84%
But what would happen if
we took the opposition

00:19:15.175 --> 00:19:17.280 align:middle line:90%
and we brought it out into 3D?

00:19:17.280 --> 00:19:19.400 align:middle line:84%
What would happen
if instead of it

00:19:19.400 --> 00:19:23.100 align:middle line:84%
being a line between two poles,
what if we made it a loop?

00:19:23.100 --> 00:19:24.600 align:middle line:84%
And if it became a
loop, wouldn't it

00:19:24.600 --> 00:19:28.510 align:middle line:84%
be easier to move back and
forth between those two poles?

00:19:28.510 --> 00:19:31.280 align:middle line:84%
So I think that the
key to the opposition

00:19:31.280 --> 00:19:34.810 align:middle line:84%
is to shift our own
personal relationship

00:19:34.810 --> 00:19:36.790 align:middle line:84%
to the geometry
of the opposition.

00:19:36.790 --> 00:19:39.320 align:middle line:84%
If we can see it as a
loop, and we can somehow

00:19:39.320 --> 00:19:43.100 align:middle line:84%
make the connection between the
two and keep the energy moving,

00:19:43.100 --> 00:19:45.610 align:middle line:84%
the opposition isn't
an opposition at all.

00:19:45.610 --> 00:19:48.120 align:middle line:84%
It's more like an
orbit, and the energy

00:19:48.120 --> 00:19:49.775 align:middle line:84%
continues to flow
back and forth,

00:19:49.775 --> 00:19:52.300 align:middle line:84%
and back and forth, and
around, and around, and around.

00:19:52.300 --> 00:19:54.590 align:middle line:84%
Now, there's another
strategy, or theory,

00:19:54.590 --> 00:19:57.720 align:middle line:84%
around oppositions, in
that if you become really

00:19:57.720 --> 00:20:00.950 align:middle line:84%
good at either pole
of the opposition,

00:20:00.950 --> 00:20:03.870 align:middle line:84%
like if you somehow manage
your responsibilities down

00:20:03.870 --> 00:20:05.456 align:middle line:84%
in the fourth house
and then managed

00:20:05.456 --> 00:20:07.330 align:middle line:84%
to do what you need to
do in the tenth house,

00:20:07.330 --> 00:20:09.410 align:middle line:84%
and you do it time,
and time, and time

00:20:09.410 --> 00:20:11.370 align:middle line:84%
again, essentially
what you do is

00:20:11.370 --> 00:20:12.820 align:middle line:84%
you begin to
shorten the distance

00:20:12.820 --> 00:20:13.810 align:middle line:90%
between the opposition.

00:20:13.810 --> 00:20:15.310 align:middle line:84%
And you begin to
meet in the middle.

00:20:15.310 --> 00:20:18.210 align:middle line:84%
And you find that sweet spot
in the center between those two

00:20:18.210 --> 00:20:18.935 align:middle line:90%
disparate poles.

00:20:18.935 --> 00:20:20.560 align:middle line:84%
So there are a couple
of different ways

00:20:20.560 --> 00:20:24.030 align:middle line:84%
of working with oppositions
in the natal chart.

00:20:24.030 --> 00:20:26.440 align:middle line:84%
In terms of
transits, oppositions

00:20:26.440 --> 00:20:29.540 align:middle line:84%
can be a little-- they can be a
little tricky because you feel

00:20:29.540 --> 00:20:31.890 align:middle line:84%
like you're being pulled
in opposite directions.

00:20:31.890 --> 00:20:33.820 align:middle line:84%
But just remember
they're transits.

00:20:33.820 --> 00:20:35.420 align:middle line:90%
They don't last forever.

00:20:35.420 --> 00:20:40.240 align:middle line:84%
And you will get through
even the most stiff and dire

00:20:40.240 --> 00:20:42.776 align:middle line:84%
of aspects, including
the opposition.

00:20:42.776 --> 00:20:44.150 align:middle line:84%
OK, so what I want
to do now is I

00:20:44.150 --> 00:20:46.410 align:middle line:84%
want to just run a couple
charts by you, so we

00:20:46.410 --> 00:20:48.500 align:middle line:90%
can see some of this in action.

00:20:48.500 --> 00:20:50.500 align:middle line:84%
This happens to be
Charles Manson's chart.

00:20:50.500 --> 00:20:52.990 align:middle line:84%
I just thought it was
kind of interesting.

00:20:52.990 --> 00:20:54.590 align:middle line:84%
So we have-- I
wanted to show you

00:20:54.590 --> 00:20:56.770 align:middle line:84%
because there are
some things about it

00:20:56.770 --> 00:21:00.530 align:middle line:84%
that we can look at and get
some idea and understanding as

00:21:00.530 --> 00:21:02.890 align:middle line:84%
to what we're
talking about here.

00:21:02.890 --> 00:21:04.860 align:middle line:84%
One of the things
that we can see

00:21:04.860 --> 00:21:09.120 align:middle line:84%
is that there is a conjunction,
very tight conjunction,

00:21:09.120 --> 00:21:12.535 align:middle line:84%
between the sun in Scorpio
and Venus in Scorpio.

00:21:12.535 --> 00:21:15.460 align:middle line:84%
In fact, when we look
at Manson's chart,

00:21:15.460 --> 00:21:18.810 align:middle line:84%
he has the sun in Scorpio,
he has Mercury in Scorpio,

00:21:18.810 --> 00:21:24.390 align:middle line:84%
he has Venus in Scorpio, and
he also has Jupiter in Scorpio.

00:21:24.390 --> 00:21:27.570 align:middle line:84%
So he has a stellium, he has
four planets in Scorpio, which

00:21:27.570 --> 00:21:32.960 align:middle line:84%
makes him a really underworld,
Plutonian kind of character,

00:21:32.960 --> 00:21:33.560 align:middle line:90%
right?

00:21:33.560 --> 00:21:36.640 align:middle line:84%
Here he has Taurus
on the ascendant,

00:21:36.640 --> 00:21:39.860 align:middle line:84%
and Uranus also there on
the ascendant -- well,

00:21:39.860 --> 00:21:43.680 align:middle line:84%
just coming out
of the 12th house.

00:21:43.680 --> 00:21:48.340 align:middle line:84%
But it's this conjunction
between the sun and Venus

00:21:48.340 --> 00:21:54.160 align:middle line:84%
in the seventh house which
gives Manson a kind of Svengali,

00:21:54.160 --> 00:21:59.600 align:middle line:84%
messianic power over
people in relationship.

00:21:59.600 --> 00:22:02.390 align:middle line:84%
That's what the sun Venus
conjunction in Scorpio

00:22:02.390 --> 00:22:03.880 align:middle line:90%
here does.

00:22:03.880 --> 00:22:05.770 align:middle line:90%
It is possessive.

00:22:05.770 --> 00:22:07.800 align:middle line:90%
It can be obsessive.

00:22:07.800 --> 00:22:11.680 align:middle line:84%
And it wields a great deal
of mesmerism and power,

00:22:11.680 --> 00:22:16.770 align:middle line:84%
especially because he also has
Jupiter Mercury again conjunct

00:22:16.770 --> 00:22:19.626 align:middle line:84%
in the sign of Scorpio
not very far behind.

00:22:19.626 --> 00:22:21.000 align:middle line:84%
And what we know
about Scorpio is

00:22:21.000 --> 00:22:25.530 align:middle line:84%
they can be very persuasive,
very magnetic, and very,

00:22:25.530 --> 00:22:27.420 align:middle line:90%
very energetic and dynamic.

00:22:27.420 --> 00:22:29.050 align:middle line:84%
So he has all this
in this chart,

00:22:29.050 --> 00:22:30.970 align:middle line:84%
he's got all this
Scorpio in this chart

00:22:30.970 --> 00:22:36.050 align:middle line:84%
but it's squaring Saturn up here
in the 11th house, in Aquarius.

00:22:36.050 --> 00:22:38.960 align:middle line:84%
Now, I find his Saturn in
Aquarius in the 11th house

00:22:38.960 --> 00:22:40.480 align:middle line:90%
to be pretty interesting.

00:22:40.480 --> 00:22:42.960 align:middle line:84%
Because if you go
back and you listen

00:22:42.960 --> 00:22:48.200 align:middle line:84%
to what Charles Manson actually
said to people like Bobby

00:22:48.200 --> 00:22:52.560 align:middle line:84%
Beausoleil and all the
other-- what was her name?

00:22:52.560 --> 00:22:55.260 align:middle line:84%
Susan Krenwinkel,
the people that

00:22:55.260 --> 00:22:57.930 align:middle line:84%
were that were part
of the Manson family.

00:22:57.930 --> 00:23:00.110 align:middle line:84%
What he was basically
telling them

00:23:00.110 --> 00:23:03.340 align:middle line:84%
was that they needed to let
go of their conditioning.

00:23:03.340 --> 00:23:05.720 align:middle line:84%
They needed to let go
of their programming.

00:23:05.720 --> 00:23:08.790 align:middle line:84%
They needed to
unlearn everything

00:23:08.790 --> 00:23:12.270 align:middle line:84%
that society taught them
in order to be free.

00:23:12.270 --> 00:23:14.640 align:middle line:84%
Now, if it wasn't
Charles Manson,

00:23:14.640 --> 00:23:20.310 align:middle line:84%
I mean, you could be listening
to somebody on Oprah Winfrey's

00:23:20.310 --> 00:23:24.760 align:middle line:84%
couch basically sharing the
same sentiments with you,

00:23:24.760 --> 00:23:28.920 align:middle line:84%
which is casting off all the
social conditioning that we've

00:23:28.920 --> 00:23:31.400 align:middle line:84%
learned so that we can
be really authentic,

00:23:31.400 --> 00:23:34.875 align:middle line:84%
and we can be really
sovereign, and free

00:23:34.875 --> 00:23:36.380 align:middle line:90%
and liberated individuals.

00:23:36.380 --> 00:23:39.030 align:middle line:84%
This is what he was sharing
with the Manson family.

00:23:39.030 --> 00:23:41.620 align:middle line:84%
And it doesn't seem
really that far

00:23:41.620 --> 00:23:44.070 align:middle line:84%
fetched in terms
of other ideologies

00:23:44.070 --> 00:23:45.770 align:middle line:84%
that are espoused
in the new age.

00:23:45.770 --> 00:23:47.760 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it's
certainly a strategy.

00:23:47.760 --> 00:23:49.370 align:middle line:84%
Well, that was
Manson's strategy.

00:23:49.370 --> 00:23:52.540 align:middle line:84%
And we can see that here,
Saturn in Aquarius up here

00:23:52.540 --> 00:23:53.820 align:middle line:90%
in the 11th house.

00:23:53.820 --> 00:24:00.640 align:middle line:84%
So he was trying to implement
a Saturnian Aquarian

00:24:00.640 --> 00:24:03.120 align:middle line:90%
kind of strategy at that time.

00:24:03.120 --> 00:24:05.310 align:middle line:84%
But it was squaring
with Pluto, it

00:24:05.310 --> 00:24:10.360 align:middle line:84%
was squaring with the sun and
Venus and Jupiter and Mercury.

00:24:10.360 --> 00:24:14.950 align:middle line:84%
So he was using that
Scorpionic energy

00:24:14.950 --> 00:24:17.850 align:middle line:84%
in a way that was
not consistent enough

00:24:17.850 --> 00:24:19.200 align:middle line:90%
flowing with that Saturn.

00:24:19.200 --> 00:24:21.340 align:middle line:84%
He was forcing the
issue, shall we say it?

00:24:21.340 --> 00:24:23.330 align:middle line:84%
He was forcing the
issue just a little bit.

00:24:23.330 --> 00:24:26.290 align:middle line:84%
But that's an indication here
of how the square would work,

00:24:26.290 --> 00:24:29.240 align:middle line:84%
and certainly with how
the conjunctions would

00:24:29.240 --> 00:24:31.030 align:middle line:90%
work as well.

00:24:31.030 --> 00:24:36.280 align:middle line:84%
We have a Venus, I'm sorry, a
Mercury and Uranus opposition,

00:24:36.280 --> 00:24:39.010 align:middle line:84%
which basically indicates
that he's rebellious.

00:24:39.010 --> 00:24:40.900 align:middle line:84%
That's what that
opposition means.

00:24:40.900 --> 00:24:46.530 align:middle line:84%
He would also be capable
of great commitments

00:24:46.530 --> 00:24:49.550 align:middle line:84%
and on some level, great
devotion, with that Scorpio,

00:24:49.550 --> 00:24:53.800 align:middle line:84%
but on the other hand, with
Uranus close to the ascendant,

00:24:53.800 --> 00:24:57.670 align:middle line:84%
he would also be quite radical,
upsetting, destabilizing,

00:24:57.670 --> 00:24:58.790 align:middle line:90%
shocking.

00:24:58.790 --> 00:25:03.840 align:middle line:84%
So this would be an individual
that would, in my estimation,

00:25:03.840 --> 00:25:06.460 align:middle line:84%
would have, at some point
in time in his life,

00:25:06.460 --> 00:25:07.620 align:middle line:90%
been traumatized.

00:25:07.620 --> 00:25:10.710 align:middle line:84%
Because what we see here is
we see a significant split

00:25:10.710 --> 00:25:12.510 align:middle line:90%
between Uranus and Mercury.

00:25:12.510 --> 00:25:14.580 align:middle line:84%
And that there's an
ideological split,

00:25:14.580 --> 00:25:18.260 align:middle line:84%
and there's an
inability to bring

00:25:18.260 --> 00:25:23.240 align:middle line:84%
this Scorpionic depth, and
intensity, and commitment

00:25:23.240 --> 00:25:28.970 align:middle line:84%
into a place where Uranus
isn't constantly fracturing

00:25:28.970 --> 00:25:31.980 align:middle line:84%
the ability to communicate,
and the ability to ground,

00:25:31.980 --> 00:25:36.530 align:middle line:84%
and the ability to bond and
form longstanding relationships.

00:25:36.530 --> 00:25:39.850 align:middle line:84%
There's always something here
in the institutional space

00:25:39.850 --> 00:25:41.960 align:middle line:84%
to the 12th house--
of course Manson

00:25:41.960 --> 00:25:44.410 align:middle line:84%
spent a lot of his
early years in prison--

00:25:44.410 --> 00:25:47.250 align:middle line:84%
that break this up
and fragment it.

00:25:47.250 --> 00:25:48.480 align:middle line:90%
What else do we have here?

00:25:48.480 --> 00:25:51.620 align:middle line:84%
There is the Mars
Neptune conjunction.

00:25:51.620 --> 00:25:53.500 align:middle line:90%
Very, very tight.

00:25:53.500 --> 00:25:58.400 align:middle line:84%
Mars in Virgo at 14 degrees,
Neptune exact at 14 degrees.

00:25:58.400 --> 00:26:01.090 align:middle line:84%
When we see the Mars
Neptune conjunction,

00:26:01.090 --> 00:26:05.300 align:middle line:84%
there can be a really
interesting kind

00:26:05.300 --> 00:26:08.640 align:middle line:84%
of emanation of
magic, mysticism.

00:26:08.640 --> 00:26:12.440 align:middle line:84%
There can be the use of
drugs, mind altering drugs,

00:26:12.440 --> 00:26:14.490 align:middle line:90%
with Mars Neptune conjunction.

00:26:14.490 --> 00:26:17.430 align:middle line:84%
It's in the fifth house, so
there's creativity involved.

00:26:17.430 --> 00:26:21.100 align:middle line:84%
There's also sex,
with the fifth house,

00:26:21.100 --> 00:26:22.850 align:middle line:90%
with Mars Neptune conjunction.

00:26:22.850 --> 00:26:26.240 align:middle line:84%
And trining the sun,
there's a lot of dynamism,

00:26:26.240 --> 00:26:29.750 align:middle line:84%
and there's a lot of inherent
power with this trine.

00:26:29.750 --> 00:26:31.290 align:middle line:90%
Manson was also a musician.

00:26:31.290 --> 00:26:33.400 align:middle line:84%
We can see that get played
out a little bit here

00:26:33.400 --> 00:26:34.750 align:middle line:90%
in the fifth house.

00:26:34.750 --> 00:26:38.790 align:middle line:84%
So there are some really
strong aspects to the chart,

00:26:38.790 --> 00:26:41.070 align:middle line:84%
but ultimately at
the end of the day,

00:26:41.070 --> 00:26:44.860 align:middle line:84%
the opposition between
Uranus and Mercury

00:26:44.860 --> 00:26:48.370 align:middle line:84%
made it almost impossible
for him to be a whole person.

00:26:48.370 --> 00:26:54.800 align:middle line:84%
The mind, and the ability to
communicate deeply held beliefs

00:26:54.800 --> 00:26:59.990 align:middle line:84%
grounded in this kind
of Scorpionic underworld

00:26:59.990 --> 00:27:04.070 align:middle line:84%
were fractured all the time
and split off with this Uranus

00:27:04.070 --> 00:27:07.800 align:middle line:84%
in the first house, which is
radical, upsetting, disturbing,

00:27:07.800 --> 00:27:10.490 align:middle line:90%
and ultimately institutional.

00:27:10.490 --> 00:27:12.330 align:middle line:84%
And then, of course,
we see the squares

00:27:12.330 --> 00:27:15.600 align:middle line:84%
with Jupiter and the sun, and
squaring off against Saturn

00:27:15.600 --> 00:27:17.870 align:middle line:90%
up there in the 11th house.

00:27:17.870 --> 00:27:19.974 align:middle line:84%
And then we also have
moon up here, true node.

00:27:19.974 --> 00:27:21.390 align:middle line:84%
The moon, the true
node conjuncts.

00:27:21.390 --> 00:27:24.970 align:middle line:84%
So his chart is marked by very
tight conjunctions, the Jupiter

00:27:24.970 --> 00:27:28.680 align:middle line:84%
Venus conjunction, the Venus sun
conjunction, the Mars Neptune

00:27:28.680 --> 00:27:31.024 align:middle line:84%
conjunction, the moon
true node conjunction.

00:27:31.024 --> 00:27:33.190 align:middle line:84%
Whenever we see a chart
with conjunctions like that,

00:27:33.190 --> 00:27:36.150 align:middle line:84%
especially that tight,
there's a lot power

00:27:36.150 --> 00:27:37.660 align:middle line:90%
that's inherent in the chart.

00:27:37.660 --> 00:27:39.860 align:middle line:84%
But there can also
be a lot of confusion

00:27:39.860 --> 00:27:45.650 align:middle line:84%
and an inability to separate
those aspects and to use them

00:27:45.650 --> 00:27:53.280 align:middle line:84%
and to actualize them in a way
that is measured and grounded.

00:27:53.280 --> 00:27:55.500 align:middle line:84%
Here the aspects
themselves almost

00:27:55.500 --> 00:27:58.505 align:middle line:84%
take control of Manson
in the chart itself.

00:27:58.505 --> 00:28:00.070 align:middle line:90%
OK, let me do one more chart.

00:28:00.070 --> 00:28:01.780 align:middle line:90%
This is the chart for today.

00:28:01.780 --> 00:28:02.700 align:middle line:90%
I pulled this up.

00:28:02.700 --> 00:28:07.970 align:middle line:84%
This is from
earlier today, 7:34.

00:28:07.970 --> 00:28:09.880 align:middle line:90%
This is kind of a horary chart.

00:28:09.880 --> 00:28:11.650 align:middle line:90%
And it's from Verdon, France.

00:28:11.650 --> 00:28:14.820 align:middle line:84%
This is just-- that's
where I was born.

00:28:14.820 --> 00:28:17.000 align:middle line:84%
But this is-- so they use
that as the birthplace,

00:28:17.000 --> 00:28:19.890 align:middle line:84%
or the chart of origination,
place of origination.

00:28:19.890 --> 00:28:21.460 align:middle line:84%
And I just pulled
it up for today.

00:28:21.460 --> 00:28:23.210 align:middle line:84%
So this is what's
happening today.

00:28:23.210 --> 00:28:27.130 align:middle line:84%
We see all these squares
going on with Pluto.

00:28:27.130 --> 00:28:30.610 align:middle line:84%
And here's the sun at 17 degrees
Capricorn, Mercury and Venus

00:28:30.610 --> 00:28:31.110 align:middle line:90%
again.

00:28:31.110 --> 00:28:33.840 align:middle line:84%
All these conjunctions
in Capricorn

00:28:33.840 --> 00:28:35.120 align:middle line:90%
taking place right now.

00:28:35.120 --> 00:28:38.260 align:middle line:84%
So there's a lot of
institutional kind

00:28:38.260 --> 00:28:42.150 align:middle line:84%
of thinking, a lot of
institutional decision making.

00:28:42.150 --> 00:28:44.290 align:middle line:84%
If you are in the
workplace, you might

00:28:44.290 --> 00:28:48.350 align:middle line:84%
be seeing transformations taking
place inside of your workplace.

00:28:48.350 --> 00:28:51.020 align:middle line:84%
Perhaps part of your
business is being peeled off,

00:28:51.020 --> 00:28:53.090 align:middle line:84%
another part of your
business is coming together.

00:28:53.090 --> 00:28:56.380 align:middle line:84%
All this is happening
under the energy

00:28:56.380 --> 00:28:59.440 align:middle line:84%
of this very tight
conjunction with Capricorn

00:28:59.440 --> 00:29:03.740 align:middle line:84%
squaring off against the energy
of Uranus and the moon today.

00:29:03.740 --> 00:29:05.980 align:middle line:90%
In Aries there's restlessness.

00:29:05.980 --> 00:29:07.790 align:middle line:90%
People are feeling anxious.

00:29:07.790 --> 00:29:12.010 align:middle line:84%
There's a sense of wanting to
take charge and take control,

00:29:12.010 --> 00:29:15.820 align:middle line:84%
but here with all of
this Capricornian energy,

00:29:15.820 --> 00:29:18.520 align:middle line:84%
the old guard, the
institutional thinking

00:29:18.520 --> 00:29:22.010 align:middle line:84%
is really kind of holding
down the weight of the chart.

00:29:22.010 --> 00:29:25.200 align:middle line:84%
Here's where all the gravitas
is, in the sixth house.

00:29:25.200 --> 00:29:28.010 align:middle line:84%
Over here we've got
Jupiter in Cancer,

00:29:28.010 --> 00:29:30.380 align:middle line:84%
which is part of this
major cardinal square

00:29:30.380 --> 00:29:31.890 align:middle line:84%
that we've got
going on right now.

00:29:31.890 --> 00:29:36.800 align:middle line:84%
Jupiter at 15, Mars at 14,
the sun at 17, Pluto at 11.

00:29:36.800 --> 00:29:39.604 align:middle line:84%
So these are not
easy times when we're

00:29:39.604 --> 00:29:41.270 align:middle line:84%
dealing with all these
cardinal planets.

00:29:41.270 --> 00:29:45.020 align:middle line:84%
And this is going to
go on for a-- really up

00:29:45.020 --> 00:29:49.260 align:middle line:84%
until about May,
June, of 2014 we're

00:29:49.260 --> 00:29:51.560 align:middle line:84%
going to be dealing with
these cardinal energies

00:29:51.560 --> 00:29:53.860 align:middle line:84%
because Jupiter is
going to be in Cancer.

00:29:53.860 --> 00:29:56.630 align:middle line:84%
Mars is still going
to be in Libra,

00:29:56.630 --> 00:29:58.694 align:middle line:84%
and of course Pluto's
not going away,

00:29:58.694 --> 00:29:59.860 align:middle line:90%
and Uranus isn't going away.

00:29:59.860 --> 00:30:01.200 align:middle line:90%
They're going to be in Aries.

00:30:01.200 --> 00:30:04.330 align:middle line:84%
So this configuration,
the cardinal square,

00:30:04.330 --> 00:30:08.720 align:middle line:84%
is going to be part of
the geometry of 2014.

00:30:08.720 --> 00:30:13.660 align:middle line:84%
And squares, as I mentioned
before, allow us to grow,

00:30:13.660 --> 00:30:15.580 align:middle line:84%
and they allow us
to get stronger.

00:30:15.580 --> 00:30:17.340 align:middle line:84%
But when we have
a cardinal square,

00:30:17.340 --> 00:30:19.030 align:middle line:90%
it's almost like your crisis.

00:30:19.030 --> 00:30:23.440 align:middle line:84%
It can be in some ways akin to
a healing crisis where there

00:30:23.440 --> 00:30:25.270 align:middle line:84%
are a number of things
happen in the body

00:30:25.270 --> 00:30:28.554 align:middle line:84%
at the same time, where if you
attempt to address one thing,

00:30:28.554 --> 00:30:30.220 align:middle line:84%
there are two or three
other things that

00:30:30.220 --> 00:30:33.130 align:middle line:84%
are taking place that also
need to be dealt with.

00:30:33.130 --> 00:30:37.232 align:middle line:84%
Now, the saving grace for today
is the Jupiter trine to Saturn.

00:30:37.232 --> 00:30:38.690 align:middle line:84%
This is going to
be on for a while,

00:30:38.690 --> 00:30:40.470 align:middle line:84%
again, because
Saturn's in Scorpio.

00:30:40.470 --> 00:30:43.510 align:middle line:84%
So we have the opportunity
to somehow integrate

00:30:43.510 --> 00:30:46.580 align:middle line:84%
this on a psychic level,
but it takes time.

00:30:46.580 --> 00:30:49.320 align:middle line:84%
It takes time away
from the event horizon.

00:30:49.320 --> 00:30:51.330 align:middle line:84%
And what we're going
through in order

00:30:51.330 --> 00:30:54.100 align:middle line:84%
to integrate some of
this stuff, time alone,

00:30:54.100 --> 00:30:56.310 align:middle line:84%
generally spent in
a hot tub or a bath,

00:30:56.310 --> 00:30:59.960 align:middle line:84%
hopefully, so that you
can, in your own life

00:30:59.960 --> 00:31:03.600 align:middle line:84%
integrate this intense-- This
is the energy that started off

00:31:03.600 --> 00:31:05.440 align:middle line:90%
for 2014, by the way.

00:31:05.440 --> 00:31:08.110 align:middle line:84%
This is what we're dealing
with at the start of the year.

00:31:08.110 --> 00:31:11.890 align:middle line:84%
So in some ways this is
like the template for 2014.

00:31:11.890 --> 00:31:15.250 align:middle line:84%
And the strategy here
is emotional renewal,

00:31:15.250 --> 00:31:22.990 align:middle line:84%
time spent away, and finding
some kind of healing modality

00:31:22.990 --> 00:31:25.920 align:middle line:84%
that you can sink yourself
into and then get back

00:31:25.920 --> 00:31:27.070 align:middle line:90%
into the fray.

00:31:27.070 --> 00:31:30.840 align:middle line:84%
And then finally we have
some really nice sextiles.

00:31:30.840 --> 00:31:34.850 align:middle line:84%
Here's the sextile in action
with Saturn and Scorpio

00:31:34.850 --> 00:31:38.120 align:middle line:84%
sextiling off into this
Capricorn energy over here.

00:31:38.120 --> 00:31:40.180 align:middle line:84%
So there's actually some
growth energy as well.

00:31:40.180 --> 00:31:42.640 align:middle line:84%
So if you're going through
change in the workplace,

00:31:42.640 --> 00:31:46.500 align:middle line:84%
if there's some organizational
dynamics that are taking place,

00:31:46.500 --> 00:31:48.050 align:middle line:90%
know it can be resolved.

00:31:48.050 --> 00:31:51.740 align:middle line:84%
And the way that you resolve it,
right, is you get into Saturn.

00:31:51.740 --> 00:31:54.570 align:middle line:84%
And the Saturn is what is
best for everybody, right?

00:31:54.570 --> 00:31:57.850 align:middle line:84%
Saturn is the mediator between
the transpersonal planets

00:31:57.850 --> 00:31:59.360 align:middle line:90%
and the personal planets.

00:31:59.360 --> 00:32:02.660 align:middle line:84%
And Saturn in Scorpio is saying,
let's get down to fundamentals.

00:32:02.660 --> 00:32:06.050 align:middle line:84%
Let's get down to how
can we all move together

00:32:06.050 --> 00:32:08.300 align:middle line:90%
in a way that empowers everyone?

00:32:08.300 --> 00:32:10.030 align:middle line:84%
And if we can find
that solution,

00:32:10.030 --> 00:32:12.040 align:middle line:84%
if we can find that
sweet spot, then you

00:32:12.040 --> 00:32:14.301 align:middle line:84%
can tap into that
sextile and say, OK, this

00:32:14.301 --> 00:32:15.300 align:middle line:90%
is how it's going to go.

00:32:15.300 --> 00:32:19.990 align:middle line:84%
We're all going to jump on board
and commit to Saturn so that we

00:32:19.990 --> 00:32:23.720 align:middle line:84%
can improve ourselves both
financially, organizationally,

00:32:23.720 --> 00:32:27.220 align:middle line:84%
and regenerate because Scorpio
is a regenerative sign.

00:32:27.220 --> 00:32:31.240 align:middle line:84%
So there's the potential for
regeneration in this chart

00:32:31.240 --> 00:32:32.180 align:middle line:90%
as well.

00:32:32.180 --> 00:32:33.640 align:middle line:90%
OK, well, there we go.

00:32:33.640 --> 00:32:36.622 align:middle line:84%
There's the chart of the day
and Charlie Manson's chart

00:32:36.622 --> 00:32:38.330 align:middle line:84%
with all those really
tight conjunctions.

00:32:38.330 --> 00:32:40.038 align:middle line:84%
And you've hopefully
learned a little bit

00:32:40.038 --> 00:32:41.640 align:middle line:90%
about aspects and transits.

00:32:41.640 --> 00:32:45.640 align:middle line:84%
And we'll continue to explore
the dynamics of astrology

00:32:45.640 --> 00:32:48.710 align:middle line:84%
in The Eleventh House, as well
a step out every now and then

00:32:48.710 --> 00:32:51.670 align:middle line:84%
and explore the meta narrative
and some of the other stuff

00:32:51.670 --> 00:32:52.360 align:middle line:90%
that we do here.

00:32:52.360 --> 00:32:54.330 align:middle line:84%
But until then, take
care of yourself.

00:32:54.330 --> 00:32:55.570 align:middle line:90%
I'm Robert Phoenix.

00:32:55.570 --> 00:32:59.150 align:middle line:84%
I will see you next time
on The Eleventh House.

00:32:59.150 --> 00:33:09.367 align:middle line:90%
