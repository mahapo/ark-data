00:00:15.945 --> 00:00:17.070 align:middle line:90%
>>ROBERT PHOENIX: Hi there.

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:19.000 align:middle line:84%
I'm Robert Phoenix,
and today we're

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:22.490 align:middle line:84%
going to take a pretty
interesting look,

00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:27.070 align:middle line:84%
it could also be put in the
context of Mercury retrograde

00:00:27.070 --> 00:00:30.590 align:middle line:84%
in Aquarius and to be a
reexamination of the sign

00:00:30.590 --> 00:00:33.360 align:middle line:84%
of Aquarius, some interesting
things happening especially

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:37.100 align:middle line:84%
as it relates to birthday
boy Ray Kurzweil and Google

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:39.600 align:middle line:84%
robotics and really
the future of humanity.

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:43.160 align:middle line:84%
So we're going to take a little
romp through Aquarius and some

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:44.845 align:middle line:84%
of the darker edges
in just a moment.

00:00:44.845 --> 00:00:46.320 align:middle line:84%
But here we are
at Gaiam Studios,

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:48.720 align:middle line:84%
and I'm in a different
place in the studio now.

00:00:48.720 --> 00:00:51.151 align:middle line:84%
It's kind of like the
solar system has shifted,

00:00:51.151 --> 00:00:52.650 align:middle line:84%
and the galaxy
shifted, so we're all

00:00:52.650 --> 00:00:55.880 align:middle line:84%
moving in space and
even my set back here.

00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:58.610 align:middle line:84%
So here we are in a new part
of the world, a new part

00:00:58.610 --> 00:01:01.320 align:middle line:84%
of the galaxy, a new part
of the universe in 2014.

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:03.180 align:middle line:90%
So let's get right into this.

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:09.520 align:middle line:84%
It starts with a check for one
penny, that's right, one penny,

00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:10.660 align:middle line:90%
and this is a check.

00:01:10.660 --> 00:01:13.870 align:middle line:84%
There are a lot of these checks
showing up on the internet now.

00:01:13.870 --> 00:01:17.140 align:middle line:84%
Artists who have their music
on Spotify-- a lot of you

00:01:17.140 --> 00:01:19.290 align:middle line:90%
out there probably use Spotify.

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:21.984 align:middle line:84%
You can listen to
anything on Spotify.

00:01:21.984 --> 00:01:23.650 align:middle line:84%
I think you can get
it through Facebook,

00:01:23.650 --> 00:01:26.880 align:middle line:84%
and you can have radio stations
and it's a wide bandwidth

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:30.149 align:middle line:84%
and content provided by
artists and those artists

00:01:30.149 --> 00:01:31.940 align:middle line:84%
theoretically, would
get paid for the music

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:33.564 align:middle line:90%
that they provide to Spotify.

00:01:33.564 --> 00:01:35.480 align:middle line:84%
But we're going to get
into that a little bit,

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:41.310 align:middle line:84%
and we're going to get into the
disappearance of physical goods

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:44.560 align:middle line:84%
and how this relates
to the Age of Aquarius

00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:46.970 align:middle line:84%
and the dark Age of
Aquarius where we're headed.

00:01:46.970 --> 00:01:50.350 align:middle line:84%
So this is a check,
void after 90 days.

00:01:50.350 --> 00:01:54.980 align:middle line:84%
It's for $0.01, one penny,
and the artist is Janis Ian.

00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:57.130 align:middle line:84%
And Janis Ian, some
of you out there

00:01:57.130 --> 00:01:58.810 align:middle line:90%
might be familiar with her.

00:01:58.810 --> 00:02:03.650 align:middle line:84%
She had a big hit back
in the '60s, "At 17."

00:02:03.650 --> 00:02:06.360 align:middle line:84%
If you were into sort
of folk pop music,

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:07.460 align:middle line:90%
you'd listen to this.

00:02:07.460 --> 00:02:09.650 align:middle line:84%
It was kind of an anthem
for a period of time.

00:02:09.650 --> 00:02:11.100 align:middle line:90%
She's a Grammy winner.

00:02:11.100 --> 00:02:13.040 align:middle line:84%
She's got a pretty
decent audience.

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:17.560 align:middle line:84%
I mean, she's not Miley Cyrus
by any stretch or Adele,

00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:20.160 align:middle line:84%
but there are people
that listen to her music.

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:27.360 align:middle line:84%
And that $0.01 check is not
atypical of an artist that

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:29.500 align:middle line:84%
doesn't get a lot
of money on Spotify.

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:31.340 align:middle line:84%
There's another
band who's really

00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:34.990 align:middle line:84%
pushing quite hard
to get artists

00:02:34.990 --> 00:02:37.530 align:middle line:84%
rights and royalties
upped on Spotify

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:40.030 align:middle line:84%
or have some other
system in place

00:02:40.030 --> 00:02:45.370 align:middle line:84%
in order to get more value
and better pay for their play

00:02:45.370 --> 00:02:47.260 align:middle line:84%
and that's Cracker
and the band is

00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:50.650 align:middle line:84%
fronted by David Lowery formerly
of Camper Van Beethoven.

00:02:50.650 --> 00:02:53.540 align:middle line:84%
They made $16 in the
last quarter at Spotify.

00:02:53.540 --> 00:02:56.020 align:middle line:84%
In some ways, it's
not Spotify's fault.

00:02:56.020 --> 00:02:57.820 align:middle line:84%
It's what's
happening to content,

00:02:57.820 --> 00:02:59.650 align:middle line:84%
and we're going
to get into that.

00:02:59.650 --> 00:03:01.704 align:middle line:84%
Here's a contemporary
picture of Janis Ian.

00:03:01.704 --> 00:03:03.370 align:middle line:84%
I thought I'd show
you the then and now.

00:03:03.370 --> 00:03:06.430 align:middle line:84%
I even brought up her
chart because I just

00:03:06.430 --> 00:03:08.390 align:middle line:84%
wanted to use this
as an example.

00:03:08.390 --> 00:03:11.110 align:middle line:84%
Currently she has
the planet Mars

00:03:11.110 --> 00:03:13.540 align:middle line:84%
in Libra going through
her second house.

00:03:13.540 --> 00:03:16.810 align:middle line:84%
So Mars in Libra is all
about equality, and fairness,

00:03:16.810 --> 00:03:19.610 align:middle line:84%
and finding the
right thing to do.

00:03:19.610 --> 00:03:22.080 align:middle line:84%
And Mars is a very
active planet.

00:03:22.080 --> 00:03:23.010 align:middle line:90%
It's a dynamic planet.

00:03:23.010 --> 00:03:23.926 align:middle line:90%
It's a planet of will.

00:03:23.926 --> 00:03:25.820 align:middle line:84%
So when you bring
those two together,

00:03:25.820 --> 00:03:30.150 align:middle line:84%
you've got quite a
force on your hands,

00:03:30.150 --> 00:03:31.670 align:middle line:84%
and it's in the
second house, which

00:03:31.670 --> 00:03:35.820 align:middle line:84%
is the house of resources, and
values, and money, and goods.

00:03:35.820 --> 00:03:37.240 align:middle line:90%
So she's out in front of this.

00:03:37.240 --> 00:03:41.120 align:middle line:84%
And you can see Mars
very active in the chart

00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:42.162 align:middle line:90%
at this point in time.

00:03:42.162 --> 00:03:43.620 align:middle line:84%
Now she's going to
run into-- she's

00:03:43.620 --> 00:03:45.830 align:middle line:90%
got Neptune at 18 degrees.

00:03:45.830 --> 00:03:47.460 align:middle line:90%
Mars is just over here.

00:03:47.460 --> 00:03:49.340 align:middle line:90%
It's almost in the third house.

00:03:49.340 --> 00:03:50.550 align:middle line:90%
It's going to go retrograde.

00:03:50.550 --> 00:03:53.120 align:middle line:84%
So right now, her whole thing
is putting the information

00:03:53.120 --> 00:03:55.940 align:middle line:84%
out there using the third house
to disseminate information

00:03:55.940 --> 00:03:58.066 align:middle line:84%
and find other like-minded
artists or people that

00:03:58.066 --> 00:03:59.702 align:middle line:84%
are going through
something similar.

00:03:59.702 --> 00:04:01.160 align:middle line:84%
But Mars is going
to move backwards

00:04:01.160 --> 00:04:03.420 align:middle line:84%
in that battle is going to
go back into the trenches,

00:04:03.420 --> 00:04:05.550 align:middle line:84%
maybe take up some
kind of legal action

00:04:05.550 --> 00:04:08.230 align:middle line:84%
once it crosses back
over Neptune over there.

00:04:08.230 --> 00:04:10.550 align:middle line:84%
So I just want to give you
kind of a look at her chart.

00:04:10.550 --> 00:04:12.890 align:middle line:84%
She's got her sun in
Aries in the 8th house.

00:04:12.890 --> 00:04:15.980 align:middle line:84%
She's got a Sun/Neptune
opposition, which isn't always

00:04:15.980 --> 00:04:19.579 align:middle line:84%
the best for cutting
through illusion,

00:04:19.579 --> 00:04:21.490 align:middle line:84%
but she's at a point
in time in her life

00:04:21.490 --> 00:04:23.897 align:middle line:84%
right now where I'm sure
she's pretty hip and wise.

00:04:23.897 --> 00:04:25.480 align:middle line:84%
So she's got Mars
going through there,

00:04:25.480 --> 00:04:28.140 align:middle line:84%
and I think she's
pretty well served

00:04:28.140 --> 00:04:31.160 align:middle line:84%
in terms of being able to deal
with this on a personal level.

00:04:31.160 --> 00:04:33.750 align:middle line:84%
Look at all these trines
down here to the ascendant.

00:04:33.750 --> 00:04:34.800 align:middle line:90%
That's a lot of trines.

00:04:34.800 --> 00:04:38.660 align:middle line:84%
She's got Moon trine,
Mercury trine, Mars trine.

00:04:38.660 --> 00:04:39.400 align:middle line:90%
There you go.

00:04:39.400 --> 00:04:39.900 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:04:39.900 --> 00:04:42.130 align:middle line:84%
So let's move on to
the next slide here.

00:04:42.130 --> 00:04:44.650 align:middle line:84%
Now, I wanted to give you,
first of all, one of the reasons

00:04:44.650 --> 00:04:50.250 align:middle line:84%
why Spotify can't pay
artists very much money

00:04:50.250 --> 00:04:55.330 align:middle line:84%
is because the amount of people
that are listening to the music

00:04:55.330 --> 00:04:56.530 align:middle line:90%
is phenomenal.

00:04:56.530 --> 00:04:59.360 align:middle line:84%
I mean, we're talking hundreds
of millions, maybe even

00:04:59.360 --> 00:05:01.200 align:middle line:84%
billions of people
listening to Spotify.

00:05:01.200 --> 00:05:03.500 align:middle line:90%
That's how popular it is.

00:05:03.500 --> 00:05:07.400 align:middle line:84%
And the economic model is that
they take the amount of listens

00:05:07.400 --> 00:05:09.630 align:middle line:84%
and they take the
amount of streams

00:05:09.630 --> 00:05:11.860 align:middle line:84%
and then they divide
it, and whatever

00:05:11.860 --> 00:05:13.530 align:middle line:84%
is the amount for
that artist, that's

00:05:13.530 --> 00:05:14.950 align:middle line:90%
pretty much what they get.

00:05:14.950 --> 00:05:19.290 align:middle line:84%
So the problem here is
at one point in time,

00:05:19.290 --> 00:05:20.780 align:middle line:90%
we actually had physical goods.

00:05:20.780 --> 00:05:21.930 align:middle line:90%
We had vinyl.

00:05:21.930 --> 00:05:24.620 align:middle line:84%
That's what I showed you
with Janis Ian's album cover.

00:05:24.620 --> 00:05:27.540 align:middle line:84%
It was vinyl-- that was part
of the Piscean Age, by the way,

00:05:27.540 --> 00:05:29.680 align:middle line:84%
because vinyl is made
out of petroleum products

00:05:29.680 --> 00:05:32.310 align:middle line:84%
and plastics, and they
have their representation

00:05:32.310 --> 00:05:33.339 align:middle line:90%
of the sign of Pisces.

00:05:33.339 --> 00:05:35.130 align:middle line:84%
So with the passing of
vinyl and the moving

00:05:35.130 --> 00:05:37.790 align:middle line:84%
into the CD, which is
an intermediary stage,

00:05:37.790 --> 00:05:42.750 align:middle line:84%
and then into the virtual era,
which is purely electronic 0's

00:05:42.750 --> 00:05:45.520 align:middle line:84%
and 1's, we have
officially shifted at least

00:05:45.520 --> 00:05:47.860 align:middle line:84%
technologically
from a media sense,

00:05:47.860 --> 00:05:49.400 align:middle line:90%
it's in the Aquarian Age.

00:05:49.400 --> 00:05:51.000 align:middle line:84%
Now, the challenge
with all this is

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:53.110 align:middle line:84%
is that there's no
physical product.

00:05:53.110 --> 00:05:55.890 align:middle line:84%
At one point in time,
something was made

00:05:55.890 --> 00:05:57.410 align:middle line:84%
and then there
was a transaction.

00:05:57.410 --> 00:06:00.350 align:middle line:84%
The transaction came at a point
of sale, and the point of sale

00:06:00.350 --> 00:06:04.300 align:middle line:84%
was usually the record store
down the street or the Columbia

00:06:04.300 --> 00:06:07.190 align:middle line:84%
music club if you did
that sort of thing.

00:06:07.190 --> 00:06:12.020 align:middle line:84%
But there is a physical, dynamic
interaction that took place.

00:06:12.020 --> 00:06:14.020 align:middle line:84%
So there was a physical
good and physical goods,

00:06:14.020 --> 00:06:15.880 align:middle line:90%
theoretically money, came back.

00:06:15.880 --> 00:06:17.840 align:middle line:90%
That's not happening anymore.

00:06:17.840 --> 00:06:21.430 align:middle line:84%
What's happened is all of
the music is now pretty much

00:06:21.430 --> 00:06:23.590 align:middle line:84%
digital, and as
a result of that,

00:06:23.590 --> 00:06:25.500 align:middle line:90%
it can be uploaded very quickly.

00:06:25.500 --> 00:06:26.950 align:middle line:84%
There's no supply
chain involved.

00:06:26.950 --> 00:06:28.340 align:middle line:90%
There's no distribution.

00:06:28.340 --> 00:06:30.900 align:middle line:84%
The mom and pop, the point
of sale, they're gone.

00:06:30.900 --> 00:06:34.600 align:middle line:84%
So we have essentially
all this physical product,

00:06:34.600 --> 00:06:36.610 align:middle line:90%
which is literally evaporated.

00:06:36.610 --> 00:06:41.660 align:middle line:84%
It's become 0's and 1's and
now lives in a digital domain.

00:06:41.660 --> 00:06:44.900 align:middle line:84%
And for a lot of people who
are not listening to Spotify,

00:06:44.900 --> 00:06:50.390 align:middle line:84%
they can go to Pirate Bay, or
they could go to any number,

00:06:50.390 --> 00:06:53.800 align:middle line:84%
Torrentz, any number of
other pirate or free sites

00:06:53.800 --> 00:06:55.640 align:middle line:84%
and they can get
that music anyway.

00:06:55.640 --> 00:07:00.179 align:middle line:84%
And the RIAA has really
stopped prosecuting people

00:07:00.179 --> 00:07:00.720 align:middle line:90%
for doing it.

00:07:00.720 --> 00:07:02.303 align:middle line:84%
Now I'm not advocating
it, but they've

00:07:02.303 --> 00:07:05.210 align:middle line:84%
stopped prosecuting people
for downloading lots of music.

00:07:05.210 --> 00:07:07.310 align:middle line:84%
It's almost
impossible right now.

00:07:07.310 --> 00:07:09.490 align:middle line:84%
So music is pretty
much worthless.

00:07:09.490 --> 00:07:11.260 align:middle line:90%
I hate to say it, but it's true.

00:07:11.260 --> 00:07:12.020 align:middle line:90%
Why?

00:07:12.020 --> 00:07:13.540 align:middle line:90%
Because it's ubiquitous.

00:07:13.540 --> 00:07:16.330 align:middle line:84%
And if you look
at what's happened

00:07:16.330 --> 00:07:18.750 align:middle line:84%
in terms of the creation
of music, a long time ago,

00:07:18.750 --> 00:07:20.280 align:middle line:90%
you had to go to a studio.

00:07:20.280 --> 00:07:21.790 align:middle line:90%
You had to hire a producer.

00:07:21.790 --> 00:07:22.995 align:middle line:90%
You had to have money.

00:07:22.995 --> 00:07:24.120 align:middle line:90%
You had to have an advance.

00:07:24.120 --> 00:07:27.610 align:middle line:84%
All these things were
part of the process.

00:07:27.610 --> 00:07:30.236 align:middle line:84%
And as bad as the music
industry has been,

00:07:30.236 --> 00:07:32.860 align:middle line:84%
they were the people that would
give you that money to do that.

00:07:32.860 --> 00:07:34.982 align:middle line:84%
Now, you could have your
studio in your home.

00:07:34.982 --> 00:07:36.690 align:middle line:84%
You could have a studio
on your computer,

00:07:36.690 --> 00:07:38.273 align:middle line:84%
and you don't have
to have a producer.

00:07:38.273 --> 00:07:40.920 align:middle line:84%
You can be that producer,
which means what?

00:07:40.920 --> 00:07:42.070 align:middle line:90%
There's more music.

00:07:42.070 --> 00:07:44.340 align:middle line:84%
And some of it is good and
some of it is not so good.

00:07:44.340 --> 00:07:47.150 align:middle line:84%
That's for you to judge,
but it's ubiquitous.

00:07:47.150 --> 00:07:48.550 align:middle line:90%
It's everywhere.

00:07:48.550 --> 00:07:52.230 align:middle line:84%
So therefore, the value
of music has shrunk

00:07:52.230 --> 00:07:54.080 align:middle line:84%
and there is no
physical representation.

00:07:54.080 --> 00:07:55.300 align:middle line:90%
Music is not the only thing.

00:07:55.300 --> 00:07:56.740 align:middle line:90%
Look at books.

00:07:56.740 --> 00:07:58.870 align:middle line:90%
I decided to bring this up here.

00:07:58.870 --> 00:08:03.430 align:middle line:84%
Amazon versus the traditional
method of publishing.

00:08:03.430 --> 00:08:05.900 align:middle line:84%
Now, there has
been a 50% decrease

00:08:05.900 --> 00:08:08.270 align:middle line:84%
in the number of
independent bookstores

00:08:08.270 --> 00:08:10.220 align:middle line:90%
over the past 20 years.

00:08:10.220 --> 00:08:13.270 align:middle line:84%
Now, Amazon has really kind
of only been on the ground

00:08:13.270 --> 00:08:16.100 align:middle line:84%
I would say for
the past 12 or 13

00:08:16.100 --> 00:08:19.460 align:middle line:84%
years in a really strong
way, but before that, you

00:08:19.460 --> 00:08:21.280 align:middle line:90%
had the Barnes Nobles.

00:08:21.280 --> 00:08:25.280 align:middle line:84%
They came online, the
big, massive box lot

00:08:25.280 --> 00:08:28.890 align:middle line:84%
stores for books and
incorporating the cafe.

00:08:28.890 --> 00:08:31.940 align:middle line:84%
So they took a chunk out of
the independent mom and pop

00:08:31.940 --> 00:08:33.380 align:middle line:90%
bookstore business.

00:08:33.380 --> 00:08:36.585 align:middle line:84%
But there used to be about
4,000 independent bookstores

00:08:36.585 --> 00:08:37.460 align:middle line:90%
in the United States.

00:08:37.460 --> 00:08:39.929 align:middle line:84%
Now, there are less than
2,000, and that number

00:08:39.929 --> 00:08:41.539 align:middle line:90%
is dropping, by the way.

00:08:41.539 --> 00:08:42.340 align:middle line:90%
Let's go over here.

00:08:42.340 --> 00:08:46.470 align:middle line:84%
19.5% the proportion
of all books

00:08:46.470 --> 00:08:50.990 align:middle line:84%
sold in the US that are Kindle
titles, ebooks, now make up

00:08:50.990 --> 00:08:55.040 align:middle line:84%
around 30% of all
book sales, and Amazon

00:08:55.040 --> 00:09:00.050 align:middle line:84%
has a 65% share within
that category with Apple--

00:09:00.050 --> 00:09:03.590 align:middle line:84%
there's the stock symbol
for Apple-- and Barnes Noble

00:09:03.590 --> 00:09:07.070 align:middle line:84%
accounting for most
of the balance.

00:09:07.070 --> 00:09:08.220 align:middle line:90%
So what are we seeing here?

00:09:08.220 --> 00:09:11.760 align:middle line:90%
We're seeing books disappear.

00:09:11.760 --> 00:09:12.940 align:middle line:90%
They are going away.

00:09:12.940 --> 00:09:14.370 align:middle line:90%
They're being virtualized.

00:09:14.370 --> 00:09:16.130 align:middle line:90%
They're being digitized.

00:09:16.130 --> 00:09:17.710 align:middle line:90%
And again, what happens?

00:09:17.710 --> 00:09:19.300 align:middle line:84%
They theoretically--
now books are

00:09:19.300 --> 00:09:21.690 align:middle line:84%
funny-- because you'll
pay almost the same amount

00:09:21.690 --> 00:09:25.540 align:middle line:84%
for a virtual book as you will
for a hardcover book, maybe

00:09:25.540 --> 00:09:26.840 align:middle line:90%
a little bit less.

00:09:26.840 --> 00:09:29.550 align:middle line:84%
But still we can see this
movement taking place.

00:09:29.550 --> 00:09:31.150 align:middle line:84%
The physical world
is going away.

00:09:31.150 --> 00:09:34.150 align:middle line:84%
$5.25 billion of Amazon's
current annual revenue

00:09:34.150 --> 00:09:35.990 align:middle line:84%
from book sales,
this is according

00:09:35.990 --> 00:09:37.200 align:middle line:90%
to one of Packer's sources.

00:09:37.200 --> 00:09:42.180 align:middle line:84%
It means books account for 7%
of the company's $75 billion

00:09:42.180 --> 00:09:44.432 align:middle line:90%
dollar total yearly revenue, 7%.

00:09:44.432 --> 00:09:46.640 align:middle line:84%
that's a pretty good number,
and it's going to go up.

00:09:46.640 --> 00:09:47.140 align:middle line:90%
Why?

00:09:47.140 --> 00:09:48.780 align:middle line:84%
Because they're at
the top of the food

00:09:48.780 --> 00:09:49.946 align:middle line:90%
chain when it comes to this.

00:09:49.946 --> 00:09:54.060 align:middle line:84%
But I'm just showing you
music is disappearing

00:09:54.060 --> 00:09:56.480 align:middle line:90%
from hard to virtual goods.

00:09:56.480 --> 00:09:57.240 align:middle line:90%
Books, same thing.

00:09:57.240 --> 00:09:57.970 align:middle line:90%
What about media?

00:09:57.970 --> 00:09:58.750 align:middle line:90%
What about movies?

00:09:58.750 --> 00:10:00.050 align:middle line:90%
Let's take a look at that.

00:10:00.050 --> 00:10:02.140 align:middle line:90%
Netflix versus the cinema.

00:10:02.140 --> 00:10:06.740 align:middle line:84%
So movie attendance, worldwide
tickets sold was $1.9 billion

00:10:06.740 --> 00:10:07.245 align:middle line:90%
in 2013.

00:10:07.245 --> 00:10:09.220 align:middle line:84%
That sounds like
a lot, doesn't it?

00:10:09.220 --> 00:10:12.115 align:middle line:84%
That's lower than any other
time in the past 18 years.

00:10:12.115 --> 00:10:14.930 align:middle line:84%
Now, if you go to movies now,
what they're trying to do

00:10:14.930 --> 00:10:16.730 align:middle line:84%
is they're trying to upsell
you on an experience, right?

00:10:16.730 --> 00:10:18.563 align:middle line:84%
They want to get you
into the movie theatre.

00:10:18.563 --> 00:10:20.882 align:middle line:84%
They want to sit you in a
really comfortable chair.

00:10:20.882 --> 00:10:21.840 align:middle line:90%
They'll bring you beer.

00:10:21.840 --> 00:10:23.131 align:middle line:90%
They'll bring you micro greens.

00:10:23.131 --> 00:10:25.030 align:middle line:90%
You name it.

00:10:25.030 --> 00:10:27.290 align:middle line:84%
It's a completely
catered affair.

00:10:27.290 --> 00:10:30.000 align:middle line:84%
That's where they're
moving the movie experience

00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:31.924 align:middle line:84%
to because they want
to recreate what's

00:10:31.924 --> 00:10:33.340 align:middle line:84%
happening at home,
because they're

00:10:33.340 --> 00:10:36.160 align:middle line:90%
competing at home with Netflix.

00:10:36.160 --> 00:10:40.020 align:middle line:84%
So Netflix total subscribers
increased to 44 million

00:10:40.020 --> 00:10:44.010 align:middle line:84%
with 2.3 million added in
the US in the fourth quarter

00:10:44.010 --> 00:10:47.570 align:middle line:84%
of last year, about 300,000
more than the midpoint

00:10:47.570 --> 00:10:50.600 align:middle line:84%
of the company's
guidance internationally,

00:10:50.600 --> 00:10:54.080 align:middle line:84%
Netflix added 1.74
million new subscribers.

00:10:54.080 --> 00:10:56.560 align:middle line:90%
Netflix is growing.

00:10:56.560 --> 00:10:59.390 align:middle line:90%
Virtual content is growing.

00:10:59.390 --> 00:11:02.390 align:middle line:90%
Digitized content is growing.

00:11:02.390 --> 00:11:07.680 align:middle line:84%
And meanwhile, digital purchases
have surged 40% last year

00:11:07.680 --> 00:11:09.450 align:middle line:90%
to $1.19 billion.

00:11:09.450 --> 00:11:14.370 align:middle line:84%
Digital growth just barely
made up for ongoing declines

00:11:14.370 --> 00:11:16.890 align:middle line:84%
in sales and rentals
of physical discs.

00:11:16.890 --> 00:11:18.120 align:middle line:90%
So here we go.

00:11:18.120 --> 00:11:19.240 align:middle line:90%
Digital media.

00:11:19.240 --> 00:11:20.650 align:middle line:90%
Physical media.

00:11:20.650 --> 00:11:22.480 align:middle line:90%
So we see this across the board.

00:11:22.480 --> 00:11:26.840 align:middle line:84%
We see that the physical
world is disappearing.

00:11:26.840 --> 00:11:28.310 align:middle line:90%
It's part of another era.

00:11:28.310 --> 00:11:31.220 align:middle line:90%


00:11:31.220 --> 00:11:34.610 align:middle line:84%
And this is just a few
examples here, manufacturing.

00:11:34.610 --> 00:11:36.750 align:middle line:84%
We used to manufacture
these things.

00:11:36.750 --> 00:11:39.920 align:middle line:84%
We used to manufacture
records, we used to bind books.

00:11:39.920 --> 00:11:43.347 align:middle line:84%
We used to press
DVDs or videotapes.

00:11:43.347 --> 00:11:44.680 align:middle line:90%
We don't really do that anymore.

00:11:44.680 --> 00:11:48.460 align:middle line:84%
All you need is one master,
and off that master,

00:11:48.460 --> 00:11:52.240 align:middle line:84%
you can send it out to
any number of outlets,

00:11:52.240 --> 00:11:55.110 align:middle line:84%
online stores,
portals, media portals,

00:11:55.110 --> 00:11:57.190 align:middle line:84%
whatever, and then you
can upload that content.

00:11:57.190 --> 00:11:58.650 align:middle line:90%
That's all you need.

00:11:58.650 --> 00:12:01.090 align:middle line:84%
You don't need to
manufacture that master.

00:12:01.090 --> 00:12:05.100 align:middle line:84%
That master could be digitally
formatted and copied.

00:12:05.100 --> 00:12:06.090 align:middle line:90%
Manufacturing?

00:12:06.090 --> 00:12:07.334 align:middle line:90%
See you later.

00:12:07.334 --> 00:12:09.000 align:middle line:84%
Now, what went along
with manufacturing?

00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:11.570 align:middle line:84%
Well, you had to get it
from one point to another.

00:12:11.570 --> 00:12:14.039 align:middle line:84%
You had trucking
and distribution.

00:12:14.039 --> 00:12:15.580 align:middle line:84%
And trucking and
distribution-- isn't

00:12:15.580 --> 00:12:16.870 align:middle line:84%
that a great chemtrail
sky, by the way?

00:12:16.870 --> 00:12:17.450 align:middle line:90%
What is that?

00:12:17.450 --> 00:12:19.420 align:middle line:90%
Is that pretty?

00:12:19.420 --> 00:12:21.600 align:middle line:84%
So we have trucking
and distribution

00:12:21.600 --> 00:12:25.840 align:middle line:84%
that used to take these
products from manufacturing

00:12:25.840 --> 00:12:28.680 align:middle line:84%
to the point of sale with
the brick and mortar.

00:12:28.680 --> 00:12:31.550 align:middle line:84%
Well, trucking and
distribution, see you later

00:12:31.550 --> 00:12:34.860 align:middle line:84%
because a lot of these
goods are going away.

00:12:34.860 --> 00:12:39.380 align:middle line:84%
And here we have a pretty
sad picture of an old Tower

00:12:39.380 --> 00:12:42.770 align:middle line:84%
Records going out of business,
but at least the sky is real.

00:12:42.770 --> 00:12:45.090 align:middle line:90%
At least the sky is natural.

00:12:45.090 --> 00:12:48.420 align:middle line:84%
So we're in another time on
a number of different levels.

00:12:48.420 --> 00:12:49.630 align:middle line:90%
So they're going away too.

00:12:49.630 --> 00:12:52.900 align:middle line:84%
So look at all the jobs
that are being eliminated

00:12:52.900 --> 00:12:55.100 align:middle line:84%
as a result of the
disappearance of media,

00:12:55.100 --> 00:12:56.810 align:middle line:90%
and this is just media.

00:12:56.810 --> 00:12:58.560 align:middle line:84%
There are other
sectors in our society

00:12:58.560 --> 00:13:01.270 align:middle line:84%
where jobs are going away,
but media is something

00:13:01.270 --> 00:13:03.630 align:middle line:84%
that we all consume, we
consume in great numbers.

00:13:03.630 --> 00:13:06.870 align:middle line:84%
And there was a whole
infrastructure set up

00:13:06.870 --> 00:13:12.250 align:middle line:84%
to support this, and it's going
away, and it's nearly gone.

00:13:12.250 --> 00:13:13.460 align:middle line:90%
Why?

00:13:13.460 --> 00:13:20.500 align:middle line:84%
Because it's become this: 0's
and 1's, 0's and 1's, 0's and

00:13:20.500 --> 00:13:21.060 align:middle line:90%
1's.

00:13:21.060 --> 00:13:25.670 align:middle line:84%
Everything that you listen
to, even the video that you're

00:13:25.670 --> 00:13:28.960 align:middle line:84%
watching me on right now, the
stream that you're experiencing

00:13:28.960 --> 00:13:32.630 align:middle line:84%
this on right now
is a 0 and a 1.

00:13:32.630 --> 00:13:33.660 align:middle line:90%
That's it.

00:13:33.660 --> 00:13:36.970 align:middle line:84%
And they're arranged
in a particular order

00:13:36.970 --> 00:13:40.870 align:middle line:84%
to represent the
material manifestation.

00:13:40.870 --> 00:13:46.090 align:middle line:84%
And this is the backbone of the
matrix that we're living in.

00:13:46.090 --> 00:13:50.220 align:middle line:84%
And this is the dark
side or the dark edge

00:13:50.220 --> 00:13:52.010 align:middle line:90%
of the Age of Aquarius.

00:13:52.010 --> 00:13:57.610 align:middle line:84%
The virtuality of reality is
becoming almost omnipresent,

00:13:57.610 --> 00:14:02.120 align:middle line:84%
and we're living actually on
the cusps of two worlds where

00:14:02.120 --> 00:14:05.320 align:middle line:84%
one world is receding
and another world is

00:14:05.320 --> 00:14:06.960 align:middle line:90%
coming into prominence.

00:14:06.960 --> 00:14:09.800 align:middle line:84%
And this world that's
coming into prominence

00:14:09.800 --> 00:14:11.230 align:middle line:90%
is a brave new world.

00:14:11.230 --> 00:14:15.589 align:middle line:84%
It's a world that very few of
us have any experience at all

00:14:15.589 --> 00:14:16.630 align:middle line:90%
in terms of dealing with.

00:14:16.630 --> 00:14:19.820 align:middle line:84%
We are at the cutting
edge of new technologies

00:14:19.820 --> 00:14:23.460 align:middle line:84%
that are going to change the way
that we live and in some ways,

00:14:23.460 --> 00:14:25.700 align:middle line:84%
not necessarily
in the best ways.

00:14:25.700 --> 00:14:28.670 align:middle line:84%
We're going to explore
that right now.

00:14:28.670 --> 00:14:30.250 align:middle line:90%
This is "Future Shock."

00:14:30.250 --> 00:14:32.730 align:middle line:90%
This book came out in the 1970s.

00:14:32.730 --> 00:14:34.870 align:middle line:84%
Alvin Toffler,
who's still alive,

00:14:34.870 --> 00:14:36.420 align:middle line:84%
wrote this book
along with his wife,

00:14:36.420 --> 00:14:38.910 align:middle line:84%
and he talks about the third
wave, the first wave being

00:14:38.910 --> 00:14:42.860 align:middle line:84%
agrarian, the second wave
being the industrial era,

00:14:42.860 --> 00:14:44.930 align:middle line:84%
and the third wave being
the technological era.

00:14:44.930 --> 00:14:46.790 align:middle line:84%
Alvin Toffler
predicted the internet.

00:14:46.790 --> 00:14:49.300 align:middle line:84%
He predicted quite a
few things that we're

00:14:49.300 --> 00:14:50.840 align:middle line:90%
experiencing right now.

00:14:50.840 --> 00:14:55.240 align:middle line:84%
So we are living in Toffler's
era of "Future Shock,"

00:14:55.240 --> 00:14:58.840 align:middle line:84%
and we're not quite aware
of how shocking it is yet,

00:14:58.840 --> 00:15:00.500 align:middle line:90%
but we will be.

00:15:00.500 --> 00:15:02.270 align:middle line:90%
This is Ray Kurzweil.

00:15:02.270 --> 00:15:04.440 align:middle line:84%
I talked about him on
one of the earlier shows,

00:15:04.440 --> 00:15:07.012 align:middle line:84%
in fact, the first show
that we did on Aquarius.

00:15:07.012 --> 00:15:08.220 align:middle line:90%
And I brought him up briefly.

00:15:08.220 --> 00:15:09.420 align:middle line:90%
He's a brilliant guy.

00:15:09.420 --> 00:15:12.200 align:middle line:84%
He created the
Kurzweil synthesizer.

00:15:12.200 --> 00:15:15.980 align:middle line:84%
It's a fantastic synthesizer
He created it right around

00:15:15.980 --> 00:15:18.550 align:middle line:84%
on the same time as the
Fairlight synthesizer,

00:15:18.550 --> 00:15:20.290 align:middle line:84%
had a lot of sampling
capabilities.

00:15:20.290 --> 00:15:23.790 align:middle line:84%
I think Stevie Wonder
was a big Kurzweil guy.

00:15:23.790 --> 00:15:25.570 align:middle line:90%
He also created a diet system.

00:15:25.570 --> 00:15:27.560 align:middle line:90%
He's a big brain Ray Kurzweil.

00:15:27.560 --> 00:15:31.590 align:middle line:84%
He's also now in charge
of Google's technology.

00:15:31.590 --> 00:15:34.450 align:middle line:84%
He's also the father
of the singularity.

00:15:34.450 --> 00:15:37.760 align:middle line:84%
So in Ray Kurzweil's
mind-- in this cranium

00:15:37.760 --> 00:15:41.980 align:middle line:84%
up here-- he believes at some
point synthetic intelligence,

00:15:41.980 --> 00:15:44.740 align:middle line:84%
artificial intelligence,
synthetic sentience

00:15:44.740 --> 00:15:47.180 align:middle line:84%
is going to surpass
human intelligence,

00:15:47.180 --> 00:15:49.300 align:middle line:84%
and in fact, not only
does he believe that,

00:15:49.300 --> 00:15:51.800 align:middle line:84%
he's going to do everything
in his power to push that,

00:15:51.800 --> 00:15:54.510 align:middle line:84%
to make that happen
sooner rather than later.

00:15:54.510 --> 00:15:55.010 align:middle line:90%
Why?

00:15:55.010 --> 00:15:56.880 align:middle line:84%
Because I think he's
got some investment

00:15:56.880 --> 00:15:59.400 align:middle line:84%
in his idea and his
model, but also I

00:15:59.400 --> 00:16:02.189 align:middle line:84%
think he's deeply driven to
create this kind of world

00:16:02.189 --> 00:16:03.230 align:middle line:90%
that we're talking about.

00:16:03.230 --> 00:16:06.040 align:middle line:84%
Now, you can see back
here, robots and beyond.

00:16:06.040 --> 00:16:08.240 align:middle line:84%
This is a sign, literally
and figuratively,

00:16:08.240 --> 00:16:10.600 align:middle line:90%
of where Ray Kurzweil is headed.

00:16:10.600 --> 00:16:14.670 align:middle line:84%
Ray Kurzweil is heading up
Google's robotics division.

00:16:14.670 --> 00:16:16.200 align:middle line:84%
We're going to
look that shortly,

00:16:16.200 --> 00:16:17.658 align:middle line:84%
but before we do--
oh, here he his.

00:16:17.658 --> 00:16:20.080 align:middle line:90%
That's how short it was.

00:16:20.080 --> 00:16:22.470 align:middle line:84%
These are the eight
companies that Google

00:16:22.470 --> 00:16:24.540 align:middle line:90%
has purchased in the past year.

00:16:24.540 --> 00:16:27.960 align:middle line:84%
These are best-of-breed
robot companies.

00:16:27.960 --> 00:16:31.100 align:middle line:84%
So this is Schaft, which is an
interesting name for a robot

00:16:31.100 --> 00:16:31.850 align:middle line:90%
company.

00:16:31.850 --> 00:16:35.160 align:middle line:84%
It's a German name, but they're
a Japanese robot company.

00:16:35.160 --> 00:16:38.170 align:middle line:84%
And they develop
robots for Fukushima.

00:16:38.170 --> 00:16:40.610 align:middle line:84%
They were the company
that developed the robots

00:16:40.610 --> 00:16:45.930 align:middle line:84%
to go in and try to work
on the melting cores

00:16:45.930 --> 00:16:48.520 align:middle line:90%
of the reactors in Fukushima.

00:16:48.520 --> 00:16:52.760 align:middle line:84%
So Schaft is known as the
rock stars of the robot world.

00:16:52.760 --> 00:16:55.420 align:middle line:90%
They also bought Holomni.

00:16:55.420 --> 00:16:57.510 align:middle line:84%
Not a lot is known
about this company.

00:16:57.510 --> 00:17:00.820 align:middle line:84%
Not a lot was known about
them when they were Holomni,

00:17:00.820 --> 00:17:03.880 align:middle line:84%
and once Google bought them,
they just shuttered their doors

00:17:03.880 --> 00:17:04.869 align:middle line:90%
and moved on.

00:17:04.869 --> 00:17:10.560 align:middle line:84%
But they are sort of the leaders
in a high-tech, omnidirectional

00:17:10.560 --> 00:17:12.069 align:middle line:90%
wheels.

00:17:12.069 --> 00:17:15.520 align:middle line:84%
They bought IPI, which is a
very interesting logo there,

00:17:15.520 --> 00:17:20.220 align:middle line:84%
which specializes in 3D
vision-guided robots.

00:17:20.220 --> 00:17:23.089 align:middle line:84%
So we're talking now three
dimensions of space and time

00:17:23.089 --> 00:17:26.260 align:middle line:84%
being built in to
robotic intelligence.

00:17:26.260 --> 00:17:28.610 align:middle line:84%
They bought a company
called Bot & Dolly,

00:17:28.610 --> 00:17:32.910 align:middle line:84%
and they specialize in robotics
automation in filmmaking.

00:17:32.910 --> 00:17:36.740 align:middle line:84%
They're considered kind
of the cultural creatives,

00:17:36.740 --> 00:17:39.250 align:middle line:84%
if you were, of the
robot community.

00:17:39.250 --> 00:17:40.430 align:middle line:90%
They're artists.

00:17:40.430 --> 00:17:47.320 align:middle line:84%
They bought Meka, M-E-K-A. And
Meka specializes in human-safe,

00:17:47.320 --> 00:17:50.720 align:middle line:84%
human-styled robots, so they
make robots warm and fuzzy.

00:17:50.720 --> 00:17:53.700 align:middle line:84%
They give the robot
a nice little, kind

00:17:53.700 --> 00:17:55.570 align:middle line:90%
of warm aura about it.

00:17:55.570 --> 00:17:57.210 align:middle line:90%
Nonthreatening.

00:17:57.210 --> 00:18:01.110 align:middle line:84%
They bought Redwood Robotics
and Redwood Robotics specializes

00:18:01.110 --> 00:18:03.430 align:middle line:84%
in robotic arms and
limbs and hands.

00:18:03.430 --> 00:18:06.010 align:middle line:84%
So if you put it all
together, you put it

00:18:06.010 --> 00:18:08.790 align:middle line:84%
all together, they're really
amassing some massive brain

00:18:08.790 --> 00:18:11.390 align:middle line:84%
power with almost
an unlimited budget.

00:18:11.390 --> 00:18:14.980 align:middle line:84%
They bought the DARPA
darlings, Boston Dynamics,

00:18:14.980 --> 00:18:19.050 align:middle line:84%
who build biped and they
build four-legged robots.

00:18:19.050 --> 00:18:21.980 align:middle line:84%
You can see the
four-legged dog or whatever

00:18:21.980 --> 00:18:23.590 align:middle line:90%
it is that they've built.

00:18:23.590 --> 00:18:26.250 align:middle line:84%
I think it runs up
to 30 miles an hour.

00:18:26.250 --> 00:18:32.510 align:middle line:84%
Put an exoskeleton on that and
it's a pretty intense creature.

00:18:32.510 --> 00:18:34.290 align:middle line:84%
And then they bought
DeepMind, which

00:18:34.290 --> 00:18:37.480 align:middle line:84%
is a fascinating company that
was started by a childhood

00:18:37.480 --> 00:18:41.230 align:middle line:84%
chess master prodigy guy
that started off in gaming,

00:18:41.230 --> 00:18:42.990 align:middle line:84%
got really good
at gaming, created

00:18:42.990 --> 00:18:45.240 align:middle line:84%
one of the highest-selling
games of all time,

00:18:45.240 --> 00:18:47.900 align:middle line:84%
and then he decide to
get into neuroscience.

00:18:47.900 --> 00:18:50.370 align:middle line:84%
So he got a PhD in neuroscience
and what he did was,

00:18:50.370 --> 00:18:51.780 align:middle line:84%
he wanted to
combine neuroscience

00:18:51.780 --> 00:18:54.370 align:middle line:84%
with artificial
intelligence, hence

00:18:54.370 --> 00:18:57.800 align:middle line:84%
DeepMind, which combines
neuroscience virtual cognitive

00:18:57.800 --> 00:18:58.780 align:middle line:90%
functioning.

00:18:58.780 --> 00:19:00.450 align:middle line:84%
You put it all
together and Google

00:19:00.450 --> 00:19:02.370 align:middle line:90%
is building the perfect beast.

00:19:02.370 --> 00:19:09.950 align:middle line:84%
They're building the robots and
the service-oriented mechanisms

00:19:09.950 --> 00:19:12.380 align:middle line:84%
for the brave new world,
for the world to come.

00:19:12.380 --> 00:19:14.710 align:middle line:90%
Now, why are they doing this?

00:19:14.710 --> 00:19:19.330 align:middle line:84%
Well, let's look at Ray
Kurzweil's chart for a moment.

00:19:19.330 --> 00:19:21.690 align:middle line:84%
Take a little detour here,
and I'll tell you why.

00:19:21.690 --> 00:19:23.960 align:middle line:90%
So Kurzweil is an Aquarius.

00:19:23.960 --> 00:19:26.700 align:middle line:84%
He's born on the 12th
of February, 1948, year

00:19:26.700 --> 00:19:27.730 align:middle line:90%
of the rats.

00:19:27.730 --> 00:19:30.560 align:middle line:84%
And down here he has
the sun in Aquarius.

00:19:30.560 --> 00:19:33.220 align:middle line:84%
He's a Scorpio rising,
and one of the things

00:19:33.220 --> 00:19:36.435 align:middle line:84%
that Scorpio rising or
Scorpio ascendant is known for

00:19:36.435 --> 00:19:37.390 align:middle line:90%
is being secretive.

00:19:37.390 --> 00:19:39.560 align:middle line:84%
They don't always
show their cards.

00:19:39.560 --> 00:19:43.700 align:middle line:84%
So Ray Kurzweil may be
very outward and very

00:19:43.700 --> 00:19:47.830 align:middle line:84%
open and transparent about
what he's doing on one level,

00:19:47.830 --> 00:19:50.110 align:middle line:84%
but on another level,
I guarantee you,

00:19:50.110 --> 00:19:53.270 align:middle line:84%
he's holding his cards
very close to his vest.

00:19:53.270 --> 00:19:55.456 align:middle line:84%
And the other thing about
Scorpio in the ascendant,

00:19:55.456 --> 00:19:56.830 align:middle line:84%
again, the ascendant
is the point

00:19:56.830 --> 00:20:00.010 align:middle line:84%
of contact with the world,
Scorpio in the ascendant

00:20:00.010 --> 00:20:03.030 align:middle line:84%
is, they transform
the world around them.

00:20:03.030 --> 00:20:05.010 align:middle line:84%
That's what Scorpio
on the ascendant does.

00:20:05.010 --> 00:20:09.610 align:middle line:84%
He wants to transform
his environment.

00:20:09.610 --> 00:20:11.784 align:middle line:84%
So what he's doing
as a result of this,

00:20:11.784 --> 00:20:13.200 align:middle line:84%
he's transforming
his environment.

00:20:13.200 --> 00:20:15.730 align:middle line:84%
He's transforming it with
artificial intelligence.

00:20:15.730 --> 00:20:20.115 align:middle line:84%
Jupiter in Sagittarius opposing
Uranus and squaring the Moon.

00:20:20.115 --> 00:20:21.740 align:middle line:84%
When we get into a
Uranus/Moon square--

00:20:21.740 --> 00:20:24.380 align:middle line:84%
his Moon is challenged, by
the way-- it's in Pisces.

00:20:24.380 --> 00:20:25.710 align:middle line:90%
It's a nice place for the Moon.

00:20:25.710 --> 00:20:27.117 align:middle line:90%
Pisces, it's poetic.

00:20:27.117 --> 00:20:28.950 align:middle line:84%
Maybe that's why he
inverted the synthesize.

00:20:28.950 --> 00:20:31.820 align:middle line:84%
Maybe he'll make some
nice robots, poet robots.

00:20:31.820 --> 00:20:39.170 align:middle line:84%
So he's got Moon in Pisces, and
it's conjunct Venus in Aries.

00:20:39.170 --> 00:20:41.340 align:middle line:84%
It's an out-of-sign
construction.

00:20:41.340 --> 00:20:44.120 align:middle line:84%
So Kurzweil isn't
necessary devoid of heart,

00:20:44.120 --> 00:20:45.340 align:middle line:90%
but his Moon is challenged.

00:20:45.340 --> 00:20:49.280 align:middle line:84%
It's squaring the futuristic
planet Uranus, right?

00:20:49.280 --> 00:20:52.045 align:middle line:84%
Uranus brings change, and
it's in the sign of Gemini

00:20:52.045 --> 00:20:53.340 align:middle line:90%
and what does Gemini represent?

00:20:53.340 --> 00:20:53.840 align:middle line:90%
Two.

00:20:53.840 --> 00:20:54.935 align:middle line:90%
It represents duality.

00:20:54.935 --> 00:20:58.030 align:middle line:84%
It represents two
levels of consciousness

00:20:58.030 --> 00:21:01.450 align:middle line:84%
or even two levels of reality,
organic-carbon reality,

00:21:01.450 --> 00:21:03.740 align:middle line:84%
carbon-based reality,
or synthetic reality.

00:21:03.740 --> 00:21:06.220 align:middle line:84%
So we have it here,
Uranus in the 8th house

00:21:06.220 --> 00:21:08.750 align:middle line:84%
again hidden away from the
world, occulted-- occluded,

00:21:08.750 --> 00:21:10.070 align:middle line:90%
and then squaring the Moon.

00:21:10.070 --> 00:21:12.270 align:middle line:84%
So he has a poetic
Moon, but here

00:21:12.270 --> 00:21:15.285 align:middle line:84%
is this Uranus and
Gemini in the 8th house.

00:21:15.285 --> 00:21:16.070 align:middle line:90%
It's like, Ray.

00:21:16.070 --> 00:21:17.520 align:middle line:90%
Come on, Ray.

00:21:17.520 --> 00:21:18.581 align:middle line:90%
Build a better robot.

00:21:18.581 --> 00:21:20.830 align:middle line:84%
And the Moon is saying, well,
as long as it can paint.

00:21:20.830 --> 00:21:21.330 align:middle line:90%
No, Ray.

00:21:21.330 --> 00:21:22.600 align:middle line:90%
Build a better robot.

00:21:22.600 --> 00:21:25.301 align:middle line:84%
So over here, we have Jupiter
squaring the Moon as well in

00:21:25.301 --> 00:21:25.800 align:middle line:90%
Sagittarius.

00:21:25.800 --> 00:21:28.600 align:middle line:84%
Jupiter in Sagittarius is
actually pretty good placement.

00:21:28.600 --> 00:21:30.720 align:middle line:84%
His chart is not
too bad, actually.

00:21:30.720 --> 00:21:33.440 align:middle line:84%
He's got Jupiter in Sagittarius,
which is pretty expansive.

00:21:33.440 --> 00:21:34.860 align:middle line:90%
He wants to expand.

00:21:34.860 --> 00:21:37.187 align:middle line:84%
What he wants to
expand here is matter

00:21:37.187 --> 00:21:38.520 align:middle line:90%
because that's the second house.

00:21:38.520 --> 00:21:42.247 align:middle line:84%
He wants to expand the material
world, and in some ways,

00:21:42.247 --> 00:21:44.080 align:middle line:84%
I think Ray Kurzweil--
I'm going to give him

00:21:44.080 --> 00:21:45.330 align:middle line:90%
the benefit of the doubt here.

00:21:45.330 --> 00:21:48.590 align:middle line:84%
I think in some ways, he wants
to democratize the material.

00:21:48.590 --> 00:21:51.300 align:middle line:84%
He wants to level the
playing field of the material

00:21:51.300 --> 00:21:52.400 align:middle line:90%
world in some ways.

00:21:52.400 --> 00:21:55.820 align:middle line:84%
And I think he thinks that
robots are the way to do it.

00:21:55.820 --> 00:21:59.580 align:middle line:84%
Also I think anybody who's
in on the development

00:21:59.580 --> 00:22:02.910 align:middle line:84%
and evolution robots also
gets to play God, and that's

00:22:02.910 --> 00:22:09.130 align:middle line:84%
got to be, in some ways, pretty
enticing and pretty seductive.

00:22:09.130 --> 00:22:12.480 align:middle line:84%
So we have Pluto up here
in Leo at the midheaven.

00:22:12.480 --> 00:22:17.210 align:middle line:84%
This is the piece right
here, Saturn and Pluto

00:22:17.210 --> 00:22:19.500 align:middle line:84%
in the midheaven, the
midheaven, the point of contact

00:22:19.500 --> 00:22:20.170 align:middle line:90%
with the world.

00:22:20.170 --> 00:22:21.990 align:middle line:84%
This is the environment,
the day-to-day environment.

00:22:21.990 --> 00:22:22.840 align:middle line:90%
This is the world.

00:22:22.840 --> 00:22:26.060 align:middle line:84%
Ray Kurzweil is a transformer
with Pluto and Saturn

00:22:26.060 --> 00:22:30.800 align:middle line:84%
right up here in Leo, but it's
opposing the sun down here

00:22:30.800 --> 00:22:31.940 align:middle line:90%
in Aquarius.

00:22:31.940 --> 00:22:34.740 align:middle line:84%
So there is a bit
of conflict at times

00:22:34.740 --> 00:22:36.700 align:middle line:90%
between the Sun and Pluto.

00:22:36.700 --> 00:22:39.850 align:middle line:84%
However, it seems like Mr.
Kurzweil's reconciled it

00:22:39.850 --> 00:22:44.171 align:middle line:84%
and is doing quite OK with
his chart and his direction

00:22:44.171 --> 00:22:44.670 align:middle line:90%
in life.

00:22:44.670 --> 00:22:45.919 align:middle line:90%
Let's go on to the next slide.

00:22:45.919 --> 00:22:48.001 align:middle line:90%
What do we have here?

00:22:48.001 --> 00:22:48.500 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:22:48.500 --> 00:22:49.750 align:middle line:84%
So we're a little
out of sequence,

00:22:49.750 --> 00:22:51.333 align:middle line:84%
but I'm going to
show you this anyway.

00:22:51.333 --> 00:22:55.550 align:middle line:84%
This is the latest
"RoboCop" film.

00:22:55.550 --> 00:22:58.372 align:middle line:84%
So there was the other
one with Peter Weller.

00:22:58.372 --> 00:22:59.830 align:middle line:84%
I think it traumatized
Peter Weller

00:22:59.830 --> 00:23:04.150 align:middle line:84%
so much that he became an
anthropology professor.

00:23:04.150 --> 00:23:06.809 align:middle line:84%
This is true, where
archeology or anthropology.

00:23:06.809 --> 00:23:08.850 align:middle line:84%
You can see him on "The
Discovery Channel" shows.

00:23:08.850 --> 00:23:11.058 align:middle line:84%
So I think being a RoboCop
might have traumatized him

00:23:11.058 --> 00:23:13.469 align:middle line:84%
so much that he wanted
to go into the past

00:23:13.469 --> 00:23:15.260 align:middle line:84%
and dig up as much of
the past as possible.

00:23:15.260 --> 00:23:17.343 align:middle line:84%
Well anyway, we've got a
new "RoboCop," of course.

00:23:17.343 --> 00:23:20.650 align:middle line:84%
"We've Got the Future
Under Control."

00:23:20.650 --> 00:23:21.150 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:23:21.150 --> 00:23:22.980 align:middle line:84%
That's a little bit
of an embed there,

00:23:22.980 --> 00:23:25.550 align:middle line:84%
a little bit of predictive
programming perhaps.

00:23:25.550 --> 00:23:28.770 align:middle line:84%
And I thought it was
fascinating that they decided

00:23:28.770 --> 00:23:35.705 align:middle line:84%
to launch the movie nationwide
on the 12th of February.

00:23:35.705 --> 00:23:37.330 align:middle line:84%
Who's born on the
12th of February?

00:23:37.330 --> 00:23:38.280 align:middle line:90%
Ray Kurzweil.

00:23:38.280 --> 00:23:38.800 align:middle line:90%
Here we go.

00:23:38.800 --> 00:23:40.160 align:middle line:90%
Sun in Aquarius.

00:23:40.160 --> 00:23:43.790 align:middle line:84%
There was Mercury in Pisces
just like what Ray Kurzweil has.

00:23:43.790 --> 00:23:50.090 align:middle line:84%
The ascendant here is at 29
Taurus, right on the cusp here,

00:23:50.090 --> 00:23:52.120 align:middle line:90%
Anaretic degree of Gemini.

00:23:52.120 --> 00:23:53.790 align:middle line:84%
And of course, Ray
Kurzweil's Uranus

00:23:53.790 --> 00:23:55.450 align:middle line:90%
would be right in the 1st house.

00:23:55.450 --> 00:23:57.810 align:middle line:84%
So I'm sure Ray
has seen "RoboCop."

00:23:57.810 --> 00:24:00.100 align:middle line:84%
Maybe he was even an
advisor to the film.

00:24:00.100 --> 00:24:03.920 align:middle line:84%
And there's a lot of other
stuff happening with this chart.

00:24:03.920 --> 00:24:05.822 align:middle line:84%
And of course, Aquarius
on the midheaven.

00:24:05.822 --> 00:24:07.280 align:middle line:84%
You're going to
see Aquarius pop up

00:24:07.280 --> 00:24:09.790 align:middle line:84%
in the midheaven throughout
this show and the next few shows

00:24:09.790 --> 00:24:11.970 align:middle line:84%
that we're going
to be doing here.

00:24:11.970 --> 00:24:14.950 align:middle line:84%
And I did this, by the
way, for February 12, 11:00

00:24:14.950 --> 00:24:19.040 align:middle line:84%
AM, probably the first showing
in New York that day, matinee.

00:24:19.040 --> 00:24:21.120 align:middle line:84%
So Aquarius very,
very prominent,

00:24:21.120 --> 00:24:24.752 align:middle line:84%
and again, coincidentally, at
the time of Ray Kurzweil's,

00:24:24.752 --> 00:24:27.470 align:middle line:90%
well the day of his birth.

00:24:27.470 --> 00:24:28.270 align:middle line:90%
So here we go.

00:24:28.270 --> 00:24:31.700 align:middle line:84%
Now, we're into Uranus in
Aries, and again, these

00:24:31.700 --> 00:24:34.650 align:middle line:84%
seem a little bit
mixed up, but we're

00:24:34.650 --> 00:24:36.370 align:middle line:90%
going to riff on these things.

00:24:36.370 --> 00:24:38.810 align:middle line:84%
Now, Uranus this is
currently in Aries right now.

00:24:38.810 --> 00:24:41.940 align:middle line:84%
And the reason I
put this in here

00:24:41.940 --> 00:24:46.080 align:middle line:84%
is because there
is a major amount

00:24:46.080 --> 00:24:50.640 align:middle line:84%
of technological development
between April 1, 1927 and March

00:24:50.640 --> 00:24:51.890 align:middle line:90%
1935.

00:24:51.890 --> 00:24:55.260 align:middle line:90%
Uranus is seven-year cycles.

00:24:55.260 --> 00:24:57.567 align:middle line:90%
And I'm just going to read off.

00:24:57.567 --> 00:24:59.650 align:middle line:84%
First of all, you have the
rise of the Third Reich

00:24:59.650 --> 00:25:00.496 align:middle line:90%
during that time.

00:25:00.496 --> 00:25:02.620 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to read off some
of the major inventions,

00:25:02.620 --> 00:25:05.780 align:middle line:84%
and the Third Reich was kind
of involved in a lot of them,

00:25:05.780 --> 00:25:06.590 align:middle line:90%
actually.

00:25:06.590 --> 00:25:10.160 align:middle line:84%
The radio telescope, that
happened between this period.

00:25:10.160 --> 00:25:11.560 align:middle line:90%
Radar.

00:25:11.560 --> 00:25:14.250 align:middle line:84%
Magnetic recording happened
during this period,

00:25:14.250 --> 00:25:17.720 align:middle line:90%
which was the advent of the LP.

00:25:17.720 --> 00:25:20.060 align:middle line:90%
FM, Frequency modulation.

00:25:20.060 --> 00:25:21.150 align:middle line:90%
The first television.

00:25:21.150 --> 00:25:23.530 align:middle line:84%
The bathysphere,
which becomes kind

00:25:23.530 --> 00:25:27.330 align:middle line:84%
of the version of the first
deep water submersible.

00:25:27.330 --> 00:25:29.830 align:middle line:84%
Plastics take off
during this time.

00:25:29.830 --> 00:25:31.110 align:middle line:90%
The quartz clock.

00:25:31.110 --> 00:25:33.220 align:middle line:90%
The analog computer.

00:25:33.220 --> 00:25:34.380 align:middle line:90%
The jet engine.

00:25:34.380 --> 00:25:37.560 align:middle line:84%
The electron microscope
all happening

00:25:37.560 --> 00:25:39.560 align:middle line:90%
during this cycle's phase.

00:25:39.560 --> 00:25:42.750 align:middle line:84%
Voice recognition,
which we are using now,

00:25:42.750 --> 00:25:45.970 align:middle line:84%
but look how far back
voice recognition actually

00:25:45.970 --> 00:25:48.700 align:middle line:84%
got on the ground, during
this Uranus in Aries phase.

00:25:48.700 --> 00:25:50.220 align:middle line:90%
Stereo recordings.

00:25:50.220 --> 00:25:51.590 align:middle line:90%
The Polaroid camera.

00:25:51.590 --> 00:25:53.160 align:middle line:90%
Zoom lens on a camera.

00:25:53.160 --> 00:25:54.500 align:middle line:90%
The helicopter.

00:25:54.500 --> 00:25:55.720 align:middle line:90%
Programming languages.

00:25:55.720 --> 00:25:57.050 align:middle line:84%
Of course, you have
the analog computer,

00:25:57.050 --> 00:25:58.508 align:middle line:84%
programming languages
are developed

00:25:58.508 --> 00:25:59.730 align:middle line:90%
during this period in time.

00:25:59.730 --> 00:26:00.989 align:middle line:90%
The fluorescent light.

00:26:00.989 --> 00:26:02.530 align:middle line:84%
This is what I think
is really funny.

00:26:02.530 --> 00:26:04.610 align:middle line:84%
I was putting this
together, and I

00:26:04.610 --> 00:26:06.320 align:middle line:84%
noticed that there's
a thread here.

00:26:06.320 --> 00:26:10.730 align:middle line:84%
The electric guitar, sunglasses,
canned beer, car radio,

00:26:10.730 --> 00:26:14.570 align:middle line:84%
the black light, the bass
guitar, the strobe light,

00:26:14.570 --> 00:26:15.500 align:middle line:90%
the ice cube tray.

00:26:15.500 --> 00:26:17.510 align:middle line:84%
I put car radio twice because
I thought that was important,

00:26:17.510 --> 00:26:18.250 align:middle line:90%
obviously.

00:26:18.250 --> 00:26:22.280 align:middle line:84%
But all these things,
these are the basics

00:26:22.280 --> 00:26:24.830 align:middle line:84%
of sex, drugs,
and rock and roll.

00:26:24.830 --> 00:26:26.150 align:middle line:90%
Rebellion right here.

00:26:26.150 --> 00:26:29.630 align:middle line:84%
It's all happening in
this seven-year period.

00:26:29.630 --> 00:26:33.070 align:middle line:84%
So rock and roll has its
foundation in Uranus in Aries.

00:26:33.070 --> 00:26:34.610 align:middle line:90%
Also the neutron was split.

00:26:34.610 --> 00:26:36.880 align:middle line:84%
Pluto was discovered,
and just to keep things

00:26:36.880 --> 00:26:39.990 align:middle line:84%
a little light, Kool-Aid,
Pez, bubble gum, and the game

00:26:39.990 --> 00:26:43.360 align:middle line:84%
Monopoly, they were all
developed during this time

00:26:43.360 --> 00:26:44.250 align:middle line:90%
as well.

00:26:44.250 --> 00:26:48.200 align:middle line:84%
By the way, I believe
if I'm not mistaken,

00:26:48.200 --> 00:26:52.890 align:middle line:84%
I think this might
be Jacob Schiff.

00:26:52.890 --> 00:26:55.790 align:middle line:84%
I think the Monopoly man
is based on Jacob Schiff.

00:26:55.790 --> 00:26:58.670 align:middle line:90%
So Kool-Aid, $0.05.

00:26:58.670 --> 00:27:00.550 align:middle line:84%
We started drinking
the Kool-Aid,

00:27:00.550 --> 00:27:03.550 align:middle line:90%
I guess, as far back then.

00:27:03.550 --> 00:27:05.100 align:middle line:90%
So where is this all headed?

00:27:05.100 --> 00:27:08.620 align:middle line:84%
Well, we're going to need
less people on this planet.

00:27:08.620 --> 00:27:12.520 align:middle line:84%
I mean, that's really where all
this technological advancement

00:27:12.520 --> 00:27:13.810 align:middle line:90%
is taking us.

00:27:13.810 --> 00:27:18.870 align:middle line:84%
That's where the virtuality
and the digitization of media

00:27:18.870 --> 00:27:20.760 align:middle line:90%
is also pointing towards.

00:27:20.760 --> 00:27:24.390 align:middle line:84%
If we have less physical goods,
we need less physical people

00:27:24.390 --> 00:27:27.414 align:middle line:84%
to create those
goods, so there's

00:27:27.414 --> 00:27:28.830 align:middle line:84%
going to be a need
for less of us.

00:27:28.830 --> 00:27:31.970 align:middle line:84%
Hence, Ray Kurzweil and
his crack team at Google

00:27:31.970 --> 00:27:35.880 align:middle line:84%
are out in front of
this creating the robots

00:27:35.880 --> 00:27:39.750 align:middle line:84%
for the future, our
virtual replacements.

00:27:39.750 --> 00:27:41.434 align:middle line:90%
This is the Georgia Guidestones.

00:27:41.434 --> 00:27:43.600 align:middle line:84%
Now, there's something
interesting about the Georgia

00:27:43.600 --> 00:27:46.240 align:middle line:84%
Guidestones I was kind of
running through with my head

00:27:46.240 --> 00:27:47.320 align:middle line:90%
before the show started.

00:27:47.320 --> 00:27:55.630 align:middle line:84%
Now, these were erected on, I
believe it was March 22, 1990,

00:27:55.630 --> 00:27:58.180 align:middle line:84%
so it would have put
it at 2 degrees Aries.

00:27:58.180 --> 00:28:03.730 align:middle line:84%
And this is in, I think, Elbert,
Georgia, if I'm not mistaken.

00:28:03.730 --> 00:28:07.247 align:middle line:84%
And what's interesting about
the Georgia Guidestones,

00:28:07.247 --> 00:28:09.330 align:middle line:84%
I mean, they've got all
these different languages,

00:28:09.330 --> 00:28:12.350 align:middle line:84%
and the basic message
is that we have

00:28:12.350 --> 00:28:16.130 align:middle line:84%
to live with the Earth
more intelligently,

00:28:16.130 --> 00:28:20.830 align:middle line:84%
rationality should be the
law and order of the day,

00:28:20.830 --> 00:28:23.730 align:middle line:84%
that we need to treat
each other better.

00:28:23.730 --> 00:28:27.740 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it's very kind of
Apollonian, not Dionysian,

00:28:27.740 --> 00:28:30.810 align:middle line:84%
real Apollonian top-down
sort of soft control

00:28:30.810 --> 00:28:32.930 align:middle line:90%
fascist tactics in some ways.

00:28:32.930 --> 00:28:35.585 align:middle line:84%
But one of the things that
the Georgia Guidestone says

00:28:35.585 --> 00:28:38.017 align:middle line:84%
is that really, the
population of the planet

00:28:38.017 --> 00:28:39.850 align:middle line:84%
should be reduced to
about 8 million people.

00:28:39.850 --> 00:28:43.220 align:middle line:84%
I mean, think about
that, 8 million people,

00:28:43.220 --> 00:28:45.766 align:middle line:84%
so that we could live in harmony
and lightly upon the earth.

00:28:45.766 --> 00:28:47.140 align:middle line:84%
Now, what's
interesting, again, I

00:28:47.140 --> 00:28:50.440 align:middle line:84%
was thinking about this at
the start of the show is

00:28:50.440 --> 00:28:53.480 align:middle line:84%
if you do the math,
the Georgia Guidestones

00:28:53.480 --> 00:29:00.150 align:middle line:84%
were basically consecrated and
witnessed on March 22, 1990.

00:29:00.150 --> 00:29:06.100 align:middle line:84%
So March 22, 2013 would
have been the 33rd year

00:29:06.100 --> 00:29:07.840 align:middle line:90%
that these had been up.

00:29:07.840 --> 00:29:10.480 align:middle line:84%
Now, we're in the 34th
year, and I personally

00:29:10.480 --> 00:29:15.040 align:middle line:84%
think that something should
have happened in the 33rd year

00:29:15.040 --> 00:29:17.210 align:middle line:84%
to get us a lot
closer to the numbers

00:29:17.210 --> 00:29:19.400 align:middle line:84%
that they're looking at
in Georgia Guidestones.

00:29:19.400 --> 00:29:24.070 align:middle line:84%
So it's my personal opinion
that whatever prophecy

00:29:24.070 --> 00:29:28.940 align:middle line:84%
is etched into these
slabs in various languages

00:29:28.940 --> 00:29:31.080 align:middle line:84%
that they have on here,
that in some ways,

00:29:31.080 --> 00:29:33.310 align:middle line:84%
we've shifted that
because we're still here.

00:29:33.310 --> 00:29:36.500 align:middle line:90%
That's just my take on it.

00:29:36.500 --> 00:29:41.810 align:middle line:84%
Well, why are people not paying
attention to what's happening?

00:29:41.810 --> 00:29:45.400 align:middle line:84%
Why can they not see the
writing on the wall, that we

00:29:45.400 --> 00:29:48.720 align:middle line:84%
are ultimately replaceable or
at least a large part of us are.

00:29:48.720 --> 00:29:55.880 align:middle line:84%
Well, it's because of this,
and it's because of this,

00:29:55.880 --> 00:29:58.810 align:middle line:90%
and it's because of this.

00:29:58.810 --> 00:30:01.825 align:middle line:84%
And believe it or not,
it's because this.

00:30:01.825 --> 00:30:04.580 align:middle line:84%
The false dichotomy between
the left and the right.

00:30:04.580 --> 00:30:07.591 align:middle line:84%
The pained look over here,
the concerned look over here.

00:30:07.591 --> 00:30:09.590 align:middle line:84%
You know where they're
going after this is done.

00:30:09.590 --> 00:30:11.050 align:middle line:84%
There heading to a
bar in Georgetown.

00:30:11.050 --> 00:30:12.650 align:middle line:84%
They're throwing a
few back and they're

00:30:12.650 --> 00:30:13.983 align:middle line:90%
slapping each other on the back.

00:30:13.983 --> 00:30:18.090 align:middle line:84%
But these are the distractions
that are pulling us away

00:30:18.090 --> 00:30:21.500 align:middle line:84%
from the big picture,
from the long tale.

00:30:21.500 --> 00:30:23.730 align:middle line:84%
And if we were to
step back and really

00:30:23.730 --> 00:30:26.660 align:middle line:84%
take a look at
what's going on, I

00:30:26.660 --> 00:30:28.980 align:middle line:84%
think some of us
would be mortified

00:30:28.980 --> 00:30:34.500 align:middle line:84%
by what's taking place and where
the planet is going in terms

00:30:34.500 --> 00:30:36.145 align:middle line:84%
of the technological
developments

00:30:36.145 --> 00:30:40.586 align:middle line:84%
and in some ways, even
the spiritual and moral--

00:30:40.586 --> 00:30:41.960 align:middle line:84%
I wouldn't say
it's development--

00:30:41.960 --> 00:30:46.140 align:middle line:84%
but the spiritual and moral
sort of attendant structures

00:30:46.140 --> 00:30:47.140 align:middle line:90%
that go along with it.

00:30:47.140 --> 00:30:49.660 align:middle line:84%
Because if you have more
artificial intelligence,

00:30:49.660 --> 00:30:54.880 align:middle line:84%
you have more virtual
goods, you have a less

00:30:54.880 --> 00:30:57.450 align:middle line:84%
organic relationship to
the world around you,

00:30:57.450 --> 00:31:00.235 align:middle line:84%
and that means you have a less
organic relation with nature.

00:31:00.235 --> 00:31:02.460 align:middle line:84%
You have a less organic
nature with procreation.

00:31:02.460 --> 00:31:05.550 align:middle line:84%
You have a less organic
nature with relationships.

00:31:05.550 --> 00:31:09.450 align:middle line:84%
I mean, we're moving away from
the cradle of the mother, which

00:31:09.450 --> 00:31:14.190 align:middle line:84%
is the natural world,
the organic world.

00:31:14.190 --> 00:31:16.270 align:middle line:84%
So one of the things
that's taking place,

00:31:16.270 --> 00:31:17.690 align:middle line:90%
let's say this is all true.

00:31:17.690 --> 00:31:19.565 align:middle line:84%
Everything I'm telling
is true, and we're all

00:31:19.565 --> 00:31:21.399 align:middle line:84%
headed towards some
sort of virtual matrix

00:31:21.399 --> 00:31:23.940 align:middle line:84%
where there's going to be a lot
less people, a lot less jobs.

00:31:23.940 --> 00:31:25.731 align:middle line:84%
What are you going to
do with all the kids?

00:31:25.731 --> 00:31:26.860 align:middle line:90%
You have to retrain them.

00:31:26.860 --> 00:31:29.640 align:middle line:84%
Well, they did this in the
1920s when the Rockefellers

00:31:29.640 --> 00:31:31.990 align:middle line:84%
took over the school
system because they wanted

00:31:31.990 --> 00:31:35.445 align:middle line:84%
to have some intelligent,
able-bodied people to man

00:31:35.445 --> 00:31:37.820 align:middle line:84%
their factories, manage the
people that man the factories

00:31:37.820 --> 00:31:39.130 align:middle line:90%
and make them money.

00:31:39.130 --> 00:31:42.590 align:middle line:84%
So we had to have education
and a pretty decent education.

00:31:42.590 --> 00:31:45.240 align:middle line:84%
But now after a period
of time, education

00:31:45.240 --> 00:31:50.660 align:middle line:84%
has been eroding and
going over the cliff

00:31:50.660 --> 00:31:51.890 align:middle line:90%
at a pretty rapid rate.

00:31:51.890 --> 00:31:55.110 align:middle line:84%
And now we have something
new in education

00:31:55.110 --> 00:31:58.140 align:middle line:84%
which is now making its
way across the country.

00:31:58.140 --> 00:32:01.050 align:middle line:84%
It's called Common Core, the
State Standards Initiative.

00:32:01.050 --> 00:32:04.569 align:middle line:84%
It's all based on testing,
hard-core testing.

00:32:04.569 --> 00:32:06.860 align:middle line:84%
And one of the things that
Common Core does, especially

00:32:06.860 --> 00:32:10.490 align:middle line:84%
for younger children, is
it gives them questions

00:32:10.490 --> 00:32:12.460 align:middle line:84%
that they're not
prepared to answer.

00:32:12.460 --> 00:32:15.110 align:middle line:84%
They may not know the
context of a particular word.

00:32:15.110 --> 00:32:18.340 align:middle line:84%
They maybe shouldn't even
be studying at a level

00:32:18.340 --> 00:32:21.400 align:middle line:84%
that they are being asked
to study at and have

00:32:21.400 --> 00:32:22.360 align:middle line:90%
hard testing with.

00:32:22.360 --> 00:32:24.980 align:middle line:84%
And as a result,
what's taking place

00:32:24.980 --> 00:32:28.680 align:middle line:84%
is that kids are feeling
miserable about themselves.

00:32:28.680 --> 00:32:31.040 align:middle line:84%
We went through this
cycle of schooling

00:32:31.040 --> 00:32:32.600 align:middle line:90%
where it was all wonderful.

00:32:32.600 --> 00:32:36.500 align:middle line:84%
It was all value based,
and everybody got a ribbon,

00:32:36.500 --> 00:32:39.650 align:middle line:84%
but now, it's taken a
sharp turn to the left

00:32:39.650 --> 00:32:43.380 align:middle line:84%
and kids are having these
very difficult tests,

00:32:43.380 --> 00:32:46.460 align:middle line:84%
and their self esteem is
going into the gutter.

00:32:46.460 --> 00:32:50.450 align:middle line:84%
But one of the things that is
associated with Common Core

00:32:50.450 --> 00:32:53.780 align:middle line:84%
is the fact that
more computers are

00:32:53.780 --> 00:32:56.870 align:middle line:84%
being introduced into
elementary schools.

00:32:56.870 --> 00:32:57.370 align:middle line:90%
Why?

00:32:57.370 --> 00:33:01.830 align:middle line:84%
Because this is the
future for those of us

00:33:01.830 --> 00:33:05.160 align:middle line:84%
who have a future in this
world creating something,

00:33:05.160 --> 00:33:08.020 align:middle line:84%
but what are they going to
be creating with computers?

00:33:08.020 --> 00:33:09.660 align:middle line:90%
I mean, it could be interesting.

00:33:09.660 --> 00:33:12.452 align:middle line:84%
We could have a planet
of Teslas or Einsteins

00:33:12.452 --> 00:33:14.535 align:middle line:84%
here and turn them loose,
and it could be actually

00:33:14.535 --> 00:33:16.350 align:middle line:90%
be pretty cool, Uranus in Aries.

00:33:16.350 --> 00:33:19.140 align:middle line:84%
Let's give them the
astrological jolt

00:33:19.140 --> 00:33:21.390 align:middle line:84%
in order to be creative
and innovative.

00:33:21.390 --> 00:33:26.030 align:middle line:84%
However, what we're seeing now
as a result of all of this,

00:33:26.030 --> 00:33:28.530 align:middle line:84%
is we're seeing
something else emerge.

00:33:28.530 --> 00:33:32.740 align:middle line:84%
We're seeing the surveillance
society become much more

00:33:32.740 --> 00:33:34.620 align:middle line:84%
powerful than ever
before, and it's not

00:33:34.620 --> 00:33:37.310 align:middle line:84%
just somebody listening
to your conversation

00:33:37.310 --> 00:33:40.130 align:middle line:84%
on the phone or somebody
dogging your emails.

00:33:40.130 --> 00:33:42.860 align:middle line:84%
It's the amount of data
that's acquired just

00:33:42.860 --> 00:33:47.280 align:middle line:84%
by a random search, just
by clicking on an ad,

00:33:47.280 --> 00:33:50.530 align:middle line:84%
just by looking for
something online,

00:33:50.530 --> 00:33:52.970 align:middle line:84%
all of a sudden your
entire profile gets

00:33:52.970 --> 00:33:55.200 align:middle line:84%
shifted, and everything
that comes to you

00:33:55.200 --> 00:33:59.360 align:middle line:84%
is based on what you were
looking for five minutes ago,

00:33:59.360 --> 00:34:01.370 align:middle line:90%
five hours ago, five days ago.

00:34:01.370 --> 00:34:03.710 align:middle line:90%
And that information gets sold.

00:34:03.710 --> 00:34:05.170 align:middle line:90%
That gets moved along.

00:34:05.170 --> 00:34:08.190 align:middle line:84%
There's a psychographic
portrait that

00:34:08.190 --> 00:34:11.250 align:middle line:84%
is representative
of who you are,

00:34:11.250 --> 00:34:14.020 align:middle line:84%
and that portrait is worth
a lot of money to people.

00:34:14.020 --> 00:34:17.530 align:middle line:84%
Because they can actually
plan, plot, and do

00:34:17.530 --> 00:34:20.929 align:middle line:84%
all kinds of really
interesting data

00:34:20.929 --> 00:34:24.790 align:middle line:84%
sets and matrices to figure
out what you're going to buy

00:34:24.790 --> 00:34:26.540 align:middle line:84%
or what somebody like
you is going to buy.

00:34:26.540 --> 00:34:29.060 align:middle line:84%
So this is another part of
the surveillance society.

00:34:29.060 --> 00:34:31.780 align:middle line:84%
It's not just about
the Stasi reporting

00:34:31.780 --> 00:34:33.889 align:middle line:84%
on what you're watching,
or what you're writing,

00:34:33.889 --> 00:34:36.480 align:middle line:84%
or what your sharing,
or what your views are,

00:34:36.480 --> 00:34:40.199 align:middle line:84%
it's what you buy when you're
on, which sites you visit to.

00:34:40.199 --> 00:34:48.900 align:middle line:84%
So this economy has exploded in
the wake of the deconstruction

00:34:48.900 --> 00:34:54.130 align:middle line:84%
of the physical economy, but
it's an economy of observance.

00:34:54.130 --> 00:34:59.379 align:middle line:84%
It's an economy that's based on
recording data and information.

00:34:59.379 --> 00:35:00.795 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't really
create anything.

00:35:00.795 --> 00:35:03.690 align:middle line:90%


00:35:03.690 --> 00:35:05.800 align:middle line:90%
This does though.

00:35:05.800 --> 00:35:09.300 align:middle line:84%
This could be one
of our saviors.

00:35:09.300 --> 00:35:14.140 align:middle line:84%
This is the 3D printer, which
became very popular, very

00:35:14.140 --> 00:35:17.150 align:middle line:90%
quickly with Uranus in Aries.

00:35:17.150 --> 00:35:18.980 align:middle line:84%
Now, the great thing
about the 3D printer

00:35:18.980 --> 00:35:21.840 align:middle line:84%
is, is that you don't
need a factory anymore.

00:35:21.840 --> 00:35:24.390 align:middle line:84%
You can manufacture pretty
much whatever you want.

00:35:24.390 --> 00:35:28.239 align:middle line:84%
Now, in the old days of the 3D
printer, you'd create a mold.

00:35:28.239 --> 00:35:29.530 align:middle line:90%
You would have the injectables.

00:35:29.530 --> 00:35:31.110 align:middle line:84%
You'd create a mold, then
you would send that off

00:35:31.110 --> 00:35:33.440 align:middle line:84%
to a factory and then
they would reproduce it.

00:35:33.440 --> 00:35:37.040 align:middle line:84%
Now, these 3D printers have
become so sophisticated,

00:35:37.040 --> 00:35:41.880 align:middle line:84%
that they have any number
of compounds, or liquids,

00:35:41.880 --> 00:35:43.820 align:middle line:84%
or solutions that
they can put in there

00:35:43.820 --> 00:35:46.110 align:middle line:84%
and inject in there,
including metals

00:35:46.110 --> 00:35:50.160 align:middle line:84%
so that you can actually create
the thing that you've plotted

00:35:50.160 --> 00:35:52.620 align:middle line:84%
out over here on your
computer, and you

00:35:52.620 --> 00:35:54.390 align:middle line:84%
don't need to send
it to a factory.

00:35:54.390 --> 00:35:58.870 align:middle line:84%
This in a lot of ways, is deep
empowerment and democratization

00:35:58.870 --> 00:35:59.940 align:middle line:90%
of this technology.

00:35:59.940 --> 00:36:01.690 align:middle line:84%
Now, I'm sure somebody
out there will say,

00:36:01.690 --> 00:36:04.991 align:middle line:84%
well, you can create a terrorist
weapon or gun, or an atom bomb,

00:36:04.991 --> 00:36:06.240 align:middle line:90%
or whatever with these things.

00:36:06.240 --> 00:36:08.950 align:middle line:84%
And so there may be a
moratorium or maybe you

00:36:08.950 --> 00:36:11.215 align:middle line:84%
have to do fingerprints or
some kind of retinal scan

00:36:11.215 --> 00:36:14.580 align:middle line:84%
to get yourself a 3D printer,
but the end of the day, this

00:36:14.580 --> 00:36:16.950 align:middle line:84%
is actually a great
development and I

00:36:16.950 --> 00:36:19.580 align:middle line:84%
think could bode
quite well for people

00:36:19.580 --> 00:36:23.910 align:middle line:84%
that have any type of
inventive or creative spirit.

00:36:23.910 --> 00:36:24.750 align:middle line:90%
Do it right at home.

00:36:24.750 --> 00:36:26.387 align:middle line:90%
Uranus in Aries.

00:36:26.387 --> 00:36:27.470 align:middle line:90%
But where does it take us?

00:36:27.470 --> 00:36:29.170 align:middle line:90%
It takes us here ultimately.

00:36:29.170 --> 00:36:30.440 align:middle line:90%
What is this?

00:36:30.440 --> 00:36:34.320 align:middle line:84%
Well, this is a replication
of a free energy device.

00:36:34.320 --> 00:36:36.820 align:middle line:84%
It's a Tesla-based
free energy device.

00:36:36.820 --> 00:36:38.480 align:middle line:84%
Because if everything
is going away,

00:36:38.480 --> 00:36:39.959 align:middle line:84%
if the physical
world is going away

00:36:39.959 --> 00:36:42.375 align:middle line:84%
and we don't have any more
physical content, if don't have

00:36:42.375 --> 00:36:45.765 align:middle line:84%
any more books or if
we have a lot less,

00:36:45.765 --> 00:36:48.040 align:middle line:84%
or we don't have as many
physical recordings,

00:36:48.040 --> 00:36:50.240 align:middle line:84%
or we don't go to
the movies so often,

00:36:50.240 --> 00:36:52.680 align:middle line:84%
or we don't have
as many DVDs, we're

00:36:52.680 --> 00:36:57.120 align:middle line:84%
looking at kind
of this, for lack

00:36:57.120 --> 00:36:59.970 align:middle line:84%
of a better term,
a democratization

00:36:59.970 --> 00:37:02.420 align:middle line:90%
of the physical world or media.

00:37:02.420 --> 00:37:04.520 align:middle line:90%
So what's the next step?

00:37:04.520 --> 00:37:07.080 align:middle line:84%
The next step is free
energy because this is all

00:37:07.080 --> 00:37:08.590 align:middle line:90%
pointed in that direction.

00:37:08.590 --> 00:37:12.110 align:middle line:84%
Before I had the slide that
had 0's and 1's, that's

00:37:12.110 --> 00:37:14.140 align:middle line:90%
also representative of money.

00:37:14.140 --> 00:37:16.220 align:middle line:84%
Money is nothing
but 0's and 1's now.

00:37:16.220 --> 00:37:17.130 align:middle line:90%
That's all it is.

00:37:17.130 --> 00:37:20.290 align:middle line:84%
In fact, it's probably
flowing through me or you

00:37:20.290 --> 00:37:22.150 align:middle line:90%
at any given point in time.

00:37:22.150 --> 00:37:25.350 align:middle line:84%
If there are satellite
transmissions of capital

00:37:25.350 --> 00:37:29.147 align:middle line:84%
or some sort of capital exchange
going on, millions of dollars

00:37:29.147 --> 00:37:31.230 align:middle line:84%
could be flowing through
you right at this moment.

00:37:31.230 --> 00:37:32.313 align:middle line:90%
You wouldn't even know it.

00:37:32.313 --> 00:37:33.250 align:middle line:90%
So here we are.

00:37:33.250 --> 00:37:36.260 align:middle line:84%
We're at the age of free energy,
which has been suppressed.

00:37:36.260 --> 00:37:38.260 align:middle line:84%
Everybody knows free
energy has been suppressed,

00:37:38.260 --> 00:37:40.310 align:middle line:84%
on a number of levels
been suppressed.

00:37:40.310 --> 00:37:42.950 align:middle line:84%
Patents have been bought,
destroyed, you name it.

00:37:42.950 --> 00:37:43.940 align:middle line:90%
But that's it.

00:37:43.940 --> 00:37:45.870 align:middle line:90%
This is the nexus point.

00:37:45.870 --> 00:37:49.110 align:middle line:84%
This is the Gordian
knot that separates us

00:37:49.110 --> 00:37:52.670 align:middle line:84%
from the disappearance
of content.

00:37:52.670 --> 00:37:55.674 align:middle line:84%
And once we get to
this point, then it's

00:37:55.674 --> 00:37:56.590 align:middle line:90%
a whole new ball game.

00:37:56.590 --> 00:37:57.673 align:middle line:90%
It's a whole new paradigm.

00:37:57.673 --> 00:37:59.260 align:middle line:84%
Now are we spiritually
ready for this?

00:37:59.260 --> 00:38:01.070 align:middle line:84%
What would we do if
we had free energy?

00:38:01.070 --> 00:38:02.361 align:middle line:90%
What would we do with our time?

00:38:02.361 --> 00:38:03.825 align:middle line:84%
Would we just watch
more football?

00:38:03.825 --> 00:38:06.400 align:middle line:84%
Would we watch more
porn on the internet?

00:38:06.400 --> 00:38:07.420 align:middle line:90%
I don't know.

00:38:07.420 --> 00:38:11.200 align:middle line:84%
But at some point, we are going
to come very close to this,

00:38:11.200 --> 00:38:16.170 align:middle line:84%
and our spiritual awareness
and the physical manifestation

00:38:16.170 --> 00:38:18.470 align:middle line:84%
of this are going
to come together.

00:38:18.470 --> 00:38:21.300 align:middle line:84%
And when it does, it's going
to be a very interesting world.

00:38:21.300 --> 00:38:23.200 align:middle line:90%
It is a game changer.

00:38:23.200 --> 00:38:25.150 align:middle line:90%
Instead, what are we doing now?

00:38:25.150 --> 00:38:27.000 align:middle line:90%
We're using technology.

00:38:27.000 --> 00:38:31.010 align:middle line:84%
We're using the Uranus in Aries
technology to frack our lands,

00:38:31.010 --> 00:38:35.770 align:middle line:84%
to poison our waters,
to extract very old

00:38:35.770 --> 00:38:41.160 align:middle line:84%
and archaic and
dirty forms of fuel.

00:38:41.160 --> 00:38:44.034 align:middle line:90%
I don't call it fossil fuel.

00:38:44.034 --> 00:38:45.200 align:middle line:90%
But that's what we're doing.

00:38:45.200 --> 00:38:47.589 align:middle line:84%
We're actually going
backwards in time.

00:38:47.589 --> 00:38:48.380 align:middle line:90%
It's a weird thing.

00:38:48.380 --> 00:38:50.050 align:middle line:84%
We're going backwards
in time, and we're

00:38:50.050 --> 00:38:51.270 align:middle line:90%
using technology to do that.

00:38:51.270 --> 00:38:54.650 align:middle line:84%
We we're fracking 15, 20
years ago, but we are now.

00:38:54.650 --> 00:38:56.680 align:middle line:90%
This is the future.

00:38:56.680 --> 00:39:00.100 align:middle line:84%
Now, there's only
one catch here.

00:39:00.100 --> 00:39:00.940 align:middle line:90%
This is David Bowie.

00:39:00.940 --> 00:39:02.730 align:middle line:84%
This is a slide
from "The Man Who

00:39:02.730 --> 00:39:05.420 align:middle line:84%
Fell to Earth," which is
one of my favorite movies.

00:39:05.420 --> 00:39:07.570 align:middle line:84%
And in this movie,
he plays an alien

00:39:07.570 --> 00:39:11.250 align:middle line:84%
who comes to Earth to
get water for his family

00:39:11.250 --> 00:39:12.260 align:middle line:90%
back on this planet.

00:39:12.260 --> 00:39:14.740 align:middle line:84%
It's a desert planet where
they don't have any water,

00:39:14.740 --> 00:39:16.600 align:middle line:84%
and what happens
is, he gets seduced.

00:39:16.600 --> 00:39:19.410 align:middle line:84%
He gets seduced by women,
he get seduced by alcohol,

00:39:19.410 --> 00:39:21.810 align:middle line:84%
and he even gets
seduced by power.

00:39:21.810 --> 00:39:22.500 align:middle line:90%
He's brilliant.

00:39:22.500 --> 00:39:26.050 align:middle line:84%
His name is Thomas Newton,
and obviously, there's

00:39:26.050 --> 00:39:30.760 align:middle line:84%
a nod to Newton, and
he is an inventor.

00:39:30.760 --> 00:39:33.640 align:middle line:84%
And what he does is,
he creates inventions

00:39:33.640 --> 00:39:35.590 align:middle line:90%
that are changing the world.

00:39:35.590 --> 00:39:39.220 align:middle line:84%
He is changing the social
economy through his inventions.

00:39:39.220 --> 00:39:42.530 align:middle line:84%
And at some point,
he is essentially,

00:39:42.530 --> 00:39:44.730 align:middle line:84%
for lack of a better
term, taken out

00:39:44.730 --> 00:39:49.250 align:middle line:84%
because his technology is
advancing things too rapidly.

00:39:49.250 --> 00:39:53.900 align:middle line:84%
And I think we're at a point
where we might see a Thomas

00:39:53.900 --> 00:39:58.460 align:middle line:84%
Newton or two in our
social set, and the people

00:39:58.460 --> 00:40:00.490 align:middle line:84%
that are going to be
walking down this path

00:40:00.490 --> 00:40:02.500 align:middle line:84%
are going to be fairly
brave, actually.

00:40:02.500 --> 00:40:05.460 align:middle line:84%
But there is, in some
ways, certainly a price

00:40:05.460 --> 00:40:08.300 align:middle line:84%
to pay because the people
that run this world don't want

00:40:08.300 --> 00:40:12.750 align:middle line:84%
the Thomas Newtons to
push the curve too much.

00:40:12.750 --> 00:40:14.280 align:middle line:90%
So here we are.

00:40:14.280 --> 00:40:17.360 align:middle line:84%
We're at the edge of
Aquarius moving into Pisces.

00:40:17.360 --> 00:40:20.470 align:middle line:84%
It's the 17th of February
while we're shooting this.

00:40:20.470 --> 00:40:21.920 align:middle line:84%
The Moon is in
lovely Libra, where

00:40:21.920 --> 00:40:23.800 align:middle line:84%
we try to balance
all things out.

00:40:23.800 --> 00:40:24.720 align:middle line:90%
It is not all dark.

00:40:24.720 --> 00:40:25.705 align:middle line:90%
It is not all gloomy.

00:40:25.705 --> 00:40:26.820 align:middle line:90%
There is hope.

00:40:26.820 --> 00:40:28.990 align:middle line:90%
And hope, by the way, is you.

00:40:28.990 --> 00:40:32.210 align:middle line:84%
You are the point of contact
for all things miraculous,

00:40:32.210 --> 00:40:34.144 align:middle line:90%
magical, and transformational.

00:40:34.144 --> 00:40:35.810 align:middle line:84%
Until next time, this
is Robert Phoenix,

00:40:35.810 --> 00:40:39.750 align:middle line:84%
and you've been watching
"The Eleventh House."

00:40:39.750 --> 00:40:51.067 align:middle line:90%
