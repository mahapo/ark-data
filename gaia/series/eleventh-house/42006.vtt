00:00:21.352 --> 00:00:23.810 align:middle line:84%
>>ROBERT PHOENIX: Hi, welcome
back to "The Eleventh House."

00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:25.780 align:middle line:90%
I'm your host, Robert Phoenix.

00:00:25.780 --> 00:00:27.950 align:middle line:84%
And this happens to be
the eleventh episode

00:00:27.950 --> 00:00:29.660 align:middle line:90%
of "The Eleventh House."

00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:32.140 align:middle line:84%
So for all you numerology
freaks out there,

00:00:32.140 --> 00:00:35.872 align:middle line:84%
it's 11/11 right here on
the set of "The Eleventh

00:00:35.872 --> 00:00:37.730 align:middle line:90%
House" with me, Robert Phoenix.

00:00:37.730 --> 00:00:39.730 align:middle line:84%
So today what we're
going to do is

00:00:39.730 --> 00:00:45.420 align:middle line:84%
we're going to continue to look
at astrology as an art form,

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:49.670 align:middle line:84%
as a science, as a tool,
as a piece of navigation

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:51.190 align:middle line:90%
for your own personal life.

00:00:51.190 --> 00:00:55.850 align:middle line:84%
And we're going to get into
the astrological wheel itself.

00:00:55.850 --> 00:01:00.100 align:middle line:84%
It's a fascinating,
absolutely fascinating symbol

00:01:00.100 --> 00:01:05.830 align:middle line:84%
and geometric map
and guidance system

00:01:05.830 --> 00:01:09.410 align:middle line:84%
for living here on this
third-dimensional experience.

00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:12.910 align:middle line:84%
So what we're going to do today,
as we break the wheel down,

00:01:12.910 --> 00:01:17.300 align:middle line:84%
is we're going to look
at each house and what

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:21.700 align:middle line:84%
the individual meaning of
each house, and what it rules.

00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:26.710 align:middle line:84%
But I'm also going to show
you the evolutionary arc

00:01:26.710 --> 00:01:29.470 align:middle line:84%
of the wheel itself,
and how it relates

00:01:29.470 --> 00:01:33.080 align:middle line:84%
to the individual in society
and culture at large.

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:35.350 align:middle line:84%
So let's start with
the first house, which

00:01:35.350 --> 00:01:37.470 align:middle line:90%
is the house of Aries.

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:44.500 align:middle line:84%
The entire wheel is 360 degrees,
and each house is 30 degrees.

00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:47.030 align:middle line:90%
So 12 times 30 is 360.

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:49.750 align:middle line:84%
At one point in time,
that was our calendar.

00:01:49.750 --> 00:01:52.300 align:middle line:84%
We had five days tacked
on to our calendar.

00:01:52.300 --> 00:01:57.550 align:middle line:84%
So now we've got this kind
of unwieldy 365-day calendar,

00:01:57.550 --> 00:02:01.010 align:middle line:84%
which does not relate to the
360-degree calendar which

00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:03.480 align:middle line:90%
is associated with astrology.

00:02:03.480 --> 00:02:08.400 align:middle line:84%
So let's get into the first
house, which is Aries.

00:02:08.400 --> 00:02:10.479 align:middle line:84%
Zero degrees,
starts right there.

00:02:10.479 --> 00:02:13.100 align:middle line:84%
We're going to come
around ultimately

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:16.690 align:middle line:84%
to 360 degrees, which is
Pisces, but right now-- actually

00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:20.480 align:middle line:84%
359 degrees-- so zero degrees,
Aries, starts right there.

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:24.520 align:middle line:84%
And Aries is the first house,
and it represents the self.

00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:26.090 align:middle line:84%
So what we're
trying to do here is

00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:28.710 align:middle line:84%
we're trying to get you to
understand how to use this

00:02:28.710 --> 00:02:30.390 align:middle line:90%
as a tool to read a chart.

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:33.350 align:middle line:84%
So let's just use
this as an example.

00:02:33.350 --> 00:02:35.800 align:middle line:90%
We have Aries, the first house.

00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:40.510 align:middle line:84%
The key words here for the sign,
the trailblazer, independence,

00:02:40.510 --> 00:02:41.360 align:middle line:90%
and image.

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:43.140 align:middle line:84%
And the first house
is almost always

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:46.780 align:middle line:84%
associated with how we
appear to the world,

00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:48.690 align:middle line:90%
especially with the ascendant.

00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:51.840 align:middle line:84%
And some astrologers--
and I'm one of them--

00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:55.020 align:middle line:84%
believe that as we
get older, we become

00:02:55.020 --> 00:02:57.480 align:middle line:84%
more of our ascendant
in some ways.

00:02:57.480 --> 00:02:59.470 align:middle line:90%
We're born with a sun sign.

00:02:59.470 --> 00:03:02.450 align:middle line:84%
But it's the ascendant that
we're always acting through.

00:03:02.450 --> 00:03:05.010 align:middle line:84%
It's the ascendant that
we're always living through.

00:03:05.010 --> 00:03:05.870 align:middle line:90%
It's the face.

00:03:05.870 --> 00:03:08.350 align:middle line:84%
It's the persona that
we're showing the world.

00:03:08.350 --> 00:03:11.620 align:middle line:84%
Now since we do this
on a daily basis,

00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:14.550 align:middle line:84%
it's going to be sort
of a fait accompli

00:03:14.550 --> 00:03:18.310 align:middle line:84%
that we become more of
our ascendant over time.

00:03:18.310 --> 00:03:21.690 align:middle line:84%
So if you are, let's
say, a Libra sun,

00:03:21.690 --> 00:03:24.520 align:middle line:84%
and you're a Pisces
ascendant, over time

00:03:24.520 --> 00:03:26.420 align:middle line:90%
you'll become more Piscean.

00:03:26.420 --> 00:03:29.370 align:middle line:84%
You will not lose
your Libran core,

00:03:29.370 --> 00:03:32.210 align:middle line:84%
but you will understand
and move through the world

00:03:32.210 --> 00:03:34.800 align:middle line:84%
more as a Pisces
than as a Libra.

00:03:34.800 --> 00:03:39.280 align:middle line:84%
Now every single sign has its
own strategy on the ascendant.

00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:41.320 align:middle line:84%
And the strategy
is developed when

00:03:41.320 --> 00:03:43.170 align:middle line:90%
the individual's quite young.

00:03:43.170 --> 00:03:45.990 align:middle line:84%
And the strategy is really
a survival strategy.

00:03:45.990 --> 00:03:48.260 align:middle line:84%
And a lot of times when
you look at a chart,

00:03:48.260 --> 00:03:51.390 align:middle line:84%
you can actually see
how a person was raised,

00:03:51.390 --> 00:03:53.450 align:middle line:84%
based on what
their ascendant is.

00:03:53.450 --> 00:03:57.240 align:middle line:84%
For instance, I'll have a
confessional moment here.

00:03:57.240 --> 00:04:00.630 align:middle line:84%
I am a Scorpio
rising, and growing up

00:04:00.630 --> 00:04:03.230 align:middle line:84%
was a challenge for
me because I had,

00:04:03.230 --> 00:04:05.190 align:middle line:84%
at times, an
unsettling childhood.

00:04:05.190 --> 00:04:08.420 align:middle line:84%
It was a kind of a
chaotic, and at times

00:04:08.420 --> 00:04:10.160 align:middle line:90%
even violent, childhood.

00:04:10.160 --> 00:04:14.850 align:middle line:84%
So as a Scorpio rising, what I
had to do through my ascendant

00:04:14.850 --> 00:04:18.690 align:middle line:84%
is I had to understand the world
through a Scorpionic context.

00:04:18.690 --> 00:04:20.769 align:middle line:84%
I had to understand
where there could

00:04:20.769 --> 00:04:23.130 align:middle line:90%
be danger lurking at any moment.

00:04:23.130 --> 00:04:25.510 align:middle line:84%
Or I had to
understand where there

00:04:25.510 --> 00:04:29.780 align:middle line:84%
would be power that would
be exhibited in any given

00:04:29.780 --> 00:04:30.530 align:middle line:90%
situation.

00:04:30.530 --> 00:04:33.840 align:middle line:84%
So I became very good
at reading a room.

00:04:33.840 --> 00:04:38.540 align:middle line:84%
I became really good at
sensing how people could react,

00:04:38.540 --> 00:04:40.672 align:middle line:84%
or how people could
have emote, or how

00:04:40.672 --> 00:04:42.005 align:middle line:90%
people could express themselves.

00:04:42.005 --> 00:04:46.210 align:middle line:84%
And as a result, I began to
be able to hone and refine

00:04:46.210 --> 00:04:50.170 align:middle line:84%
my Scorpio rising, and move it
from a survival skill, which

00:04:50.170 --> 00:04:54.240 align:middle line:84%
I had to learn as a child, to
a skill where now I'm actually

00:04:54.240 --> 00:04:57.640 align:middle line:84%
using it as an astrologer
to help understand people,

00:04:57.640 --> 00:04:59.700 align:middle line:84%
to help people
understand themselves.

00:04:59.700 --> 00:05:01.730 align:middle line:84%
So this is just
one aspect of how

00:05:01.730 --> 00:05:04.430 align:middle line:84%
we use the rising
sign as a strategy.

00:05:04.430 --> 00:05:08.400 align:middle line:84%
Another aspect would be, let's
say, Libra on the ascendant.

00:05:08.400 --> 00:05:10.800 align:middle line:84%
People that are born
with a Libra ascendant,

00:05:10.800 --> 00:05:12.710 align:middle line:90%
they tend to use their charm.

00:05:12.710 --> 00:05:14.320 align:middle line:90%
They tend to use their wit.

00:05:14.320 --> 00:05:18.950 align:middle line:84%
They tend to use their, at
times, personal beauty in order

00:05:18.950 --> 00:05:24.230 align:middle line:84%
to navigate through the
perhaps at times unsteady,

00:05:24.230 --> 00:05:28.830 align:middle line:84%
or challenging, or tricky
landscape as a child.

00:05:28.830 --> 00:05:31.630 align:middle line:84%
But generally speaking, people
who have Libra on the ascendant

00:05:31.630 --> 00:05:36.900 align:middle line:84%
don't necessarily have
difficult or rough childhoods.

00:05:36.900 --> 00:05:39.400 align:middle line:84%
They tend to have more
harmonious and balanced

00:05:39.400 --> 00:05:41.380 align:middle line:84%
childhoods than a
lot of other people.

00:05:41.380 --> 00:05:44.200 align:middle line:84%
But that said, if they
do have a situation

00:05:44.200 --> 00:05:47.350 align:middle line:84%
where things are complex or they
have to get out of a situation,

00:05:47.350 --> 00:05:49.180 align:middle line:84%
they'll revert to
charm or they'll

00:05:49.180 --> 00:05:52.930 align:middle line:84%
revert to some form of
flattery, or whatever

00:05:52.930 --> 00:05:56.580 align:middle line:90%
that thing is that is Libran.

00:05:56.580 --> 00:05:58.536 align:middle line:84%
They'll plug in and
they'll use that

00:05:58.536 --> 00:05:59.660 align:middle line:90%
as part of their ascendant.

00:05:59.660 --> 00:06:02.680 align:middle line:84%
And of course over
time, theoretically,

00:06:02.680 --> 00:06:06.200 align:middle line:84%
we would use these less for
survival strategies and tools,

00:06:06.200 --> 00:06:09.280 align:middle line:84%
and more for personal
growth and helping us grow

00:06:09.280 --> 00:06:10.680 align:middle line:90%
and helping other people grow.

00:06:10.680 --> 00:06:13.380 align:middle line:84%
But that's just one
component of the ascendant.

00:06:13.380 --> 00:06:15.690 align:middle line:84%
Another component of the
ascendant in the first house

00:06:15.690 --> 00:06:18.700 align:middle line:84%
is how we appear to the
world, how we show up.

00:06:18.700 --> 00:06:21.280 align:middle line:84%
One of the aspects
of somebody who's

00:06:21.280 --> 00:06:23.220 align:middle line:84%
a Capricorn on the
ascendant, they

00:06:23.220 --> 00:06:25.430 align:middle line:84%
would have craggy
features sometimes.

00:06:25.430 --> 00:06:28.910 align:middle line:84%
Or they would have-- as a youth,
they would look quite old.

00:06:28.910 --> 00:06:32.100 align:middle line:84%
And as they get older, they
would begin to get younger.

00:06:32.100 --> 00:06:34.750 align:middle line:84%
That's another component
of Capricorn rising.

00:06:34.750 --> 00:06:36.690 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes with Capricorn
in the ascendant,

00:06:36.690 --> 00:06:40.080 align:middle line:84%
there can be an uneven
nature with the form.

00:06:40.080 --> 00:06:41.900 align:middle line:84%
One leg might be
longer than the other.

00:06:41.900 --> 00:06:44.190 align:middle line:84%
Or one arm might be
longer than the other.

00:06:44.190 --> 00:06:47.720 align:middle line:84%
There's something about
Capricorn on the ascendant that

00:06:47.720 --> 00:06:51.040 align:middle line:84%
makes the individual appear
different and stand out.

00:06:51.040 --> 00:06:53.970 align:middle line:84%
And as a result, the
Capricorn ascendant

00:06:53.970 --> 00:06:57.060 align:middle line:84%
tends to be a bit more aloof,
tends to hold themselves

00:06:57.060 --> 00:06:59.810 align:middle line:84%
back more in terms
of interaction

00:06:59.810 --> 00:07:03.420 align:middle line:84%
and communicating and
relating with other people.

00:07:03.420 --> 00:07:07.600 align:middle line:84%
So there's a number of different
ways in which a person can be,

00:07:07.600 --> 00:07:09.940 align:middle line:84%
at times, identified
through the ascendant.

00:07:09.940 --> 00:07:11.595 align:middle line:90%
It's absolutely fascinating.

00:07:11.595 --> 00:07:14.400 align:middle line:84%
And as a result,
there is a strategy.

00:07:14.400 --> 00:07:16.774 align:middle line:84%
Now there's also a way in
which we present ourselves

00:07:16.774 --> 00:07:17.690 align:middle line:90%
through the ascendant.

00:07:17.690 --> 00:07:19.750 align:middle line:84%
Somebody who's a
Leo on the ascendant

00:07:19.750 --> 00:07:22.720 align:middle line:84%
might have really
long hair, or they

00:07:22.720 --> 00:07:28.710 align:middle line:84%
may have a type of style that
is really colorful and flowing,

00:07:28.710 --> 00:07:31.370 align:middle line:84%
and something that looks like,
almost like robes at times.

00:07:31.370 --> 00:07:36.620 align:middle line:84%
So there is this whole notion
that we can project ourselves

00:07:36.620 --> 00:07:38.890 align:middle line:84%
through the ascendant
into the world.

00:07:38.890 --> 00:07:40.910 align:middle line:90%
And it is dictated by sign.

00:07:40.910 --> 00:07:43.460 align:middle line:84%
Now sometimes that
will change when

00:07:43.460 --> 00:07:44.960 align:middle line:84%
there's a transit
through the chart.

00:07:44.960 --> 00:07:48.120 align:middle line:84%
Now if somebody has-- let's
say they're an Aries ascendant,

00:07:48.120 --> 00:07:50.660 align:middle line:84%
and right now
Uranus is transiting

00:07:50.660 --> 00:07:52.070 align:middle line:90%
through the sign of Aries.

00:07:52.070 --> 00:07:55.250 align:middle line:84%
They'll have Uranus in
their first house, which

00:07:55.250 --> 00:07:57.800 align:middle line:84%
would absolutely
change their identity,

00:07:57.800 --> 00:08:00.202 align:middle line:84%
and it would change how they
would appear to the world.

00:08:00.202 --> 00:08:02.160 align:middle line:84%
They would take more
risks with their identity,

00:08:02.160 --> 00:08:03.990 align:middle line:90%
because that's what Uranus does.

00:08:03.990 --> 00:08:07.454 align:middle line:84%
They may get involved in
something that is dangerous,

00:08:07.454 --> 00:08:09.370 align:middle line:84%
and something that might
have a bit of an edge

00:08:09.370 --> 00:08:12.080 align:middle line:84%
to it, like jumping
out of airplanes.

00:08:12.080 --> 00:08:14.800 align:middle line:84%
Or they may get involved
with MMA, or something

00:08:14.800 --> 00:08:17.470 align:middle line:84%
that would be very
Aries, but also

00:08:17.470 --> 00:08:19.440 align:middle line:84%
have kind of a
unique angle to it,

00:08:19.440 --> 00:08:21.017 align:middle line:90%
which would be very Uranian.

00:08:21.017 --> 00:08:23.100 align:middle line:84%
And there could be a very
different style of dress

00:08:23.100 --> 00:08:25.480 align:middle line:90%
that manifests as a result.

00:08:25.480 --> 00:08:28.390 align:middle line:84%
So this is how the
first house operates.

00:08:28.390 --> 00:08:32.880 align:middle line:84%
It colors how we
appear to the world.

00:08:32.880 --> 00:08:36.240 align:middle line:84%
And every sign-- every
one of the 12 signs--

00:08:36.240 --> 00:08:38.112 align:middle line:84%
can be a part of
the first house.

00:08:38.112 --> 00:08:39.570 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't always
have to be Aries.

00:08:39.570 --> 00:08:43.700 align:middle line:84%
Just because Aries rules the
first house, and the sign

00:08:43.700 --> 00:08:45.590 align:middle line:84%
of the first house could
be, as we mentioned,

00:08:45.590 --> 00:08:48.440 align:middle line:84%
Scorpio or Cancer or Libra
or Pisces or Capricorn--

00:08:48.440 --> 00:08:49.540 align:middle line:90%
any one of them.

00:08:49.540 --> 00:08:52.230 align:middle line:84%
It all depends on the rising
sign at the time of the birth.

00:08:52.230 --> 00:08:55.140 align:middle line:84%
Now how this works is-- we're
going to get into this-- Aries

00:08:55.140 --> 00:08:56.500 align:middle line:90%
represents the individual.

00:08:56.500 --> 00:08:59.770 align:middle line:84%
It represents pure
will that is manifest.

00:08:59.770 --> 00:09:03.220 align:middle line:84%
There is nothing really
complex about Aries

00:09:03.220 --> 00:09:05.210 align:middle line:90%
as a symbol for the first house.

00:09:05.210 --> 00:09:09.480 align:middle line:84%
It is the arrival of the
self onto the planet.

00:09:09.480 --> 00:09:11.370 align:middle line:90%
That's what Aries represents.

00:09:11.370 --> 00:09:13.210 align:middle line:84%
That's what the first
house represents.

00:09:13.210 --> 00:09:15.730 align:middle line:84%
Now we go down to the second
house, and here we are.

00:09:15.730 --> 00:09:17.680 align:middle line:90%
This is Taurus.

00:09:17.680 --> 00:09:19.840 align:middle line:90%
It is a fixed house.

00:09:19.840 --> 00:09:21.740 align:middle line:84%
Here we have some
more keywords--

00:09:21.740 --> 00:09:25.580 align:middle line:84%
the grower,
productivity, stability.

00:09:25.580 --> 00:09:29.620 align:middle line:84%
And here's where we get into
the evolution of the self

00:09:29.620 --> 00:09:31.330 align:middle line:90%
as we move around the chart.

00:09:31.330 --> 00:09:34.310 align:middle line:84%
Here we have pure will
manifest the arrival.

00:09:34.310 --> 00:09:35.690 align:middle line:90%
Now we come into Taurus.

00:09:35.690 --> 00:09:37.660 align:middle line:90%
Now we come into the body.

00:09:37.660 --> 00:09:39.340 align:middle line:90%
It's the first earth sign.

00:09:39.340 --> 00:09:43.150 align:middle line:84%
We're young, we're babies,
we have these very Taurean

00:09:43.150 --> 00:09:43.650 align:middle line:90%
moments.

00:09:43.650 --> 00:09:46.440 align:middle line:84%
We have to learn how
to go to the bathroom.

00:09:46.440 --> 00:09:49.230 align:middle line:84%
We have to begin to learn
to take care of ourselves.

00:09:49.230 --> 00:09:51.440 align:middle line:84%
This is where, fortunately
or unfortunately,

00:09:51.440 --> 00:09:55.580 align:middle line:84%
we become aware of
our bodily functions

00:09:55.580 --> 00:09:58.830 align:middle line:84%
at a very basic,
fundamental level.

00:09:58.830 --> 00:10:01.000 align:middle line:84%
This is where toilet
training comes into play.

00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:02.290 align:middle line:90%
This is the first chakra.

00:10:02.290 --> 00:10:06.290 align:middle line:84%
This is all very earth,
root-related stuff, right here

00:10:06.290 --> 00:10:07.470 align:middle line:90%
in the first house.

00:10:07.470 --> 00:10:10.350 align:middle line:84%
So here we have,
again, this evolution

00:10:10.350 --> 00:10:14.720 align:middle line:84%
of the individual arrival and
boom, coming into the body,

00:10:14.720 --> 00:10:16.310 align:middle line:90%
figuring out how the body works.

00:10:16.310 --> 00:10:19.290 align:middle line:84%
Taurus rules the voice
as well, and speaking.

00:10:19.290 --> 00:10:22.030 align:middle line:84%
Here in the second
house it's about values.

00:10:22.030 --> 00:10:23.780 align:middle line:90%
It's about materiality.

00:10:23.780 --> 00:10:24.960 align:middle line:90%
It's about land.

00:10:24.960 --> 00:10:27.030 align:middle line:90%
It's about the metals.

00:10:27.030 --> 00:10:30.030 align:middle line:84%
It's about the earth
itself-- growing things.

00:10:30.030 --> 00:10:32.720 align:middle line:84%
It's real, basic,
fundamental stuff.

00:10:32.720 --> 00:10:34.660 align:middle line:84%
And if you've ever
hung out with anybody

00:10:34.660 --> 00:10:36.480 align:middle line:84%
who have planets in
the second house,

00:10:36.480 --> 00:10:39.750 align:middle line:84%
one of the things that they
value the most is money.

00:10:39.750 --> 00:10:42.840 align:middle line:84%
They're really into money,
material possessions, material

00:10:42.840 --> 00:10:45.400 align:middle line:84%
goods, growing and
building things.

00:10:45.400 --> 00:10:49.530 align:middle line:84%
People that have Jupiter
in the second house-- which

00:10:49.530 --> 00:10:51.230 align:middle line:84%
we call an accidental
exultation,

00:10:51.230 --> 00:10:54.350 align:middle line:84%
because Jupiter is exalted
in Taurus-- people who

00:10:54.350 --> 00:10:56.380 align:middle line:84%
have Jupiter in the
second house tend

00:10:56.380 --> 00:11:00.151 align:middle line:84%
to do quite well in terms of
finances, money, and material

00:11:00.151 --> 00:11:00.650 align:middle line:90%
goods.

00:11:00.650 --> 00:11:03.310 align:middle line:84%
I'll give you an example again,
from my own personal life.

00:11:03.310 --> 00:11:06.500 align:middle line:84%
My father, he never
graduated from high school.

00:11:06.500 --> 00:11:07.790 align:middle line:90%
He had a GED.

00:11:07.790 --> 00:11:10.360 align:middle line:84%
But he had Jupiter
in his second house.

00:11:10.360 --> 00:11:12.360 align:middle line:84%
And throughout all
of his adult life,

00:11:12.360 --> 00:11:14.550 align:middle line:90%
he drove Cadillacs, Mercedes.

00:11:14.550 --> 00:11:17.780 align:middle line:84%
He had a boat, rode
BMW motorcycles.

00:11:17.780 --> 00:11:20.940 align:middle line:84%
This is a manifestation of
Jupiter in the second house.

00:11:20.940 --> 00:11:24.480 align:middle line:84%
Doesn't matter if
you're rich or you've

00:11:24.480 --> 00:11:27.670 align:middle line:84%
been endowed with money
from your parents,

00:11:27.670 --> 00:11:29.070 align:middle line:90%
or your grandparents.

00:11:29.070 --> 00:11:30.550 align:middle line:90%
It just manifests that way.

00:11:30.550 --> 00:11:33.640 align:middle line:84%
So if you've got Jupiter in the
second house, congratulations.

00:11:33.640 --> 00:11:36.440 align:middle line:84%
You've got a bit of karmic
luck and balancing there.

00:11:36.440 --> 00:11:39.630 align:middle line:84%
So now we move to the third
house ruled by Gemini.

00:11:39.630 --> 00:11:42.310 align:middle line:84%
Gemini, the talker--
communication, connection.

00:11:42.310 --> 00:11:44.560 align:middle line:84%
Here is where we
go from-- again,

00:11:44.560 --> 00:11:46.060 align:middle line:84%
we showed up here
as the individual.

00:11:46.060 --> 00:11:47.020 align:middle line:90%
We arrived.

00:11:47.020 --> 00:11:48.850 align:middle line:90%
Here we find out about our body.

00:11:48.850 --> 00:11:51.380 align:middle line:84%
We go through toilet
training-- all that really

00:11:51.380 --> 00:11:53.360 align:middle line:84%
basic, fundamental
stuff, you know,

00:11:53.360 --> 00:11:54.966 align:middle line:90%
root chakra-related material.

00:11:54.966 --> 00:11:56.340 align:middle line:84%
Now we come into
the third house,

00:11:56.340 --> 00:11:58.050 align:middle line:84%
Gemini-- talk, talk,
talk, talk, talk.

00:11:58.050 --> 00:12:00.010 align:middle line:90%
We begin the learning process.

00:12:00.010 --> 00:12:04.890 align:middle line:84%
It is symbolized by
the sign of Gemini,

00:12:04.890 --> 00:12:06.820 align:middle line:90%
which is the two as the one.

00:12:06.820 --> 00:12:09.180 align:middle line:84%
And this is where we begin
to become aware, slightly

00:12:09.180 --> 00:12:12.160 align:middle line:84%
aware of ourselves, slightly
aware of other people

00:12:12.160 --> 00:12:13.260 align:middle line:90%
in our lives.

00:12:13.260 --> 00:12:17.240 align:middle line:84%
This house rules siblings and
extended family-- cousins,

00:12:17.240 --> 00:12:19.060 align:middle line:90%
nephews, things like that.

00:12:19.060 --> 00:12:22.660 align:middle line:84%
It also rules early
childhood education,

00:12:22.660 --> 00:12:24.730 align:middle line:84%
from nursery school
up until probably

00:12:24.730 --> 00:12:27.630 align:middle line:84%
around the end of grade
school and middle school.

00:12:27.630 --> 00:12:29.840 align:middle line:90%
This is where we're learning.

00:12:29.840 --> 00:12:32.570 align:middle line:90%
That's all the third house.

00:12:32.570 --> 00:12:35.470 align:middle line:84%
We're learning how to speak,
we're learning how to add.

00:12:35.470 --> 00:12:38.490 align:middle line:84%
We're basically
engaged in this kind

00:12:38.490 --> 00:12:40.910 align:middle line:84%
of, again, this
evolutionary arc.

00:12:40.910 --> 00:12:43.860 align:middle line:84%
This is the next phase and
cycle of the development

00:12:43.860 --> 00:12:45.180 align:middle line:90%
of the individual.

00:12:45.180 --> 00:12:46.740 align:middle line:84%
Now in terms of
the second house,

00:12:46.740 --> 00:12:48.540 align:middle line:84%
if people have planets
in the second house,

00:12:48.540 --> 00:12:52.080 align:middle line:84%
if you know someone that has
Mercury here, or Venus here,

00:12:52.080 --> 00:12:56.870 align:middle line:84%
or Mars here, they can tend
to be very active individuals.

00:12:56.870 --> 00:12:59.560 align:middle line:84%
The third house
also rules the area

00:12:59.560 --> 00:13:02.440 align:middle line:84%
that's around you, like down
the street, around the corner,

00:13:02.440 --> 00:13:03.570 align:middle line:90%
or across town.

00:13:03.570 --> 00:13:05.510 align:middle line:84%
Those are all very
third house kinds

00:13:05.510 --> 00:13:07.750 align:middle line:90%
of areas, aspects, and zones.

00:13:07.750 --> 00:13:10.070 align:middle line:84%
Whereas the ninth house
is across the country,

00:13:10.070 --> 00:13:12.640 align:middle line:84%
across the planet, the
third house is quite local.

00:13:12.640 --> 00:13:14.407 align:middle line:84%
So if somebody
has a large number

00:13:14.407 --> 00:13:15.990 align:middle line:84%
planets in the third
house, they could

00:13:15.990 --> 00:13:19.030 align:middle line:90%
be involved in local politics.

00:13:19.030 --> 00:13:21.780 align:middle line:84%
They can be involved in
local boards of education,

00:13:21.780 --> 00:13:23.910 align:middle line:90%
local theater, local drama.

00:13:23.910 --> 00:13:27.110 align:middle line:84%
Anything that has to do
with the world around them.

00:13:27.110 --> 00:13:30.440 align:middle line:84%
They become very engaged in
that area of their lives.

00:13:30.440 --> 00:13:32.590 align:middle line:90%
So that's the third house.

00:13:32.590 --> 00:13:35.042 align:middle line:84%
Now we're over here, moving
into the fourth house.

00:13:35.042 --> 00:13:36.500 align:middle line:84%
The normal rule of
the fourth house

00:13:36.500 --> 00:13:39.640 align:middle line:84%
is Cancer, the empath,
nurturing, security.

00:13:39.640 --> 00:13:40.510 align:middle line:90%
This is the home.

00:13:40.510 --> 00:13:41.718 align:middle line:90%
The fourth house is the home.

00:13:41.718 --> 00:13:45.790 align:middle line:84%
Right here, this
is the Imum Coeli.

00:13:45.790 --> 00:13:49.520 align:middle line:84%
This is the IC, also known
as the nadir of the charts.

00:13:49.520 --> 00:13:54.010 align:middle line:84%
And this represents the
basic, fundamental structure

00:13:54.010 --> 00:13:56.310 align:middle line:84%
and foundation of
the individual--

00:13:56.310 --> 00:13:59.750 align:middle line:84%
where they grew up, what
their home life was like, what

00:13:59.750 --> 00:14:04.000 align:middle line:84%
their mother was like, what
they like to have around them

00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:06.800 align:middle line:84%
in the home, what
they need to nurture.

00:14:06.800 --> 00:14:08.500 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes it can
be very positive,

00:14:08.500 --> 00:14:09.916 align:middle line:84%
or sometimes it
can be challenged.

00:14:09.916 --> 00:14:11.440 align:middle line:90%
That's how charts work out.

00:14:11.440 --> 00:14:14.360 align:middle line:84%
If you have, let's say Mars
down here in the fourth house,

00:14:14.360 --> 00:14:17.056 align:middle line:84%
or you know somebody that
has Mars in the fourth house,

00:14:17.056 --> 00:14:18.430 align:middle line:84%
there's a very
strong chance they

00:14:18.430 --> 00:14:20.354 align:middle line:84%
might have experienced
violence in the home.

00:14:20.354 --> 00:14:22.770 align:middle line:84%
If you know somebody that has
Jupiter in the fourth house,

00:14:22.770 --> 00:14:24.800 align:middle line:84%
maybe they grew up
in a very large home,

00:14:24.800 --> 00:14:27.670 align:middle line:84%
or an expansive home,
something like an estate.

00:14:27.670 --> 00:14:30.420 align:middle line:84%
If you know somebody has
Venus in the fourth house,

00:14:30.420 --> 00:14:33.770 align:middle line:84%
there's a possibility
that they have a real need

00:14:33.770 --> 00:14:37.480 align:middle line:84%
to have a very aesthetic
experience in their home.

00:14:37.480 --> 00:14:39.320 align:middle line:90%
And they fall in love at home.

00:14:39.320 --> 00:14:41.700 align:middle line:84%
They manifest their
relationships at home.

00:14:41.700 --> 00:14:44.247 align:middle line:84%
So home, really, home
and mother really

00:14:44.247 --> 00:14:45.330 align:middle line:90%
dominate the fourth house.

00:14:45.330 --> 00:14:49.390 align:middle line:84%
It also relates to
nostalgia, and to some extent

00:14:49.390 --> 00:14:50.970 align:middle line:90%
previous generations as well.

00:14:50.970 --> 00:14:53.280 align:middle line:84%
We get some of that up
in the eighth house, too.

00:14:53.280 --> 00:14:54.990 align:middle line:84%
But here in the fourth
house now, we're

00:14:54.990 --> 00:14:58.640 align:middle line:84%
learning about-- we've
gone from just arriving,

00:14:58.640 --> 00:15:01.080 align:middle line:84%
to the basic bodily
function of the individual,

00:15:01.080 --> 00:15:03.342 align:middle line:84%
learning, communicating,
understanding

00:15:03.342 --> 00:15:04.800 align:middle line:84%
that there are
others in the world.

00:15:04.800 --> 00:15:07.900 align:middle line:84%
Now we're moving further
and deeper into the world.

00:15:07.900 --> 00:15:12.200 align:middle line:84%
We're moving into things like
restaurants and grocery stores,

00:15:12.200 --> 00:15:15.370 align:middle line:84%
which are also very much a
part of the fourth house.

00:15:15.370 --> 00:15:16.810 align:middle line:90%
We're engaging with mother.

00:15:16.810 --> 00:15:19.820 align:middle line:84%
We're starting to engage also
with the feminine essence,

00:15:19.820 --> 00:15:21.520 align:middle line:90%
whether you're male or female.

00:15:21.520 --> 00:15:24.070 align:middle line:84%
That's all part of the
fourth house as well.

00:15:24.070 --> 00:15:27.380 align:middle line:84%
We begin to sink roots,
and develop roots and have

00:15:27.380 --> 00:15:30.140 align:middle line:84%
associations with
the fourth house.

00:15:30.140 --> 00:15:33.010 align:middle line:84%
were We begin to
ground as individuals.

00:15:33.010 --> 00:15:36.200 align:middle line:84%
Then we move on to the
fifth house, which is Leo.

00:15:36.200 --> 00:15:41.560 align:middle line:84%
And Leo is the showman, and
the performance, the performer,

00:15:41.560 --> 00:15:42.730 align:middle line:90%
and creativity.

00:15:42.730 --> 00:15:46.610 align:middle line:84%
And the fifth house itself
rules things like hobbies,

00:15:46.610 --> 00:15:51.430 align:middle line:84%
and passions, and love,
and children, and gambling,

00:15:51.430 --> 00:15:54.610 align:middle line:84%
sports to some extent,
and also the father.

00:15:54.610 --> 00:15:57.480 align:middle line:84%
So whenever planets show
up in the fifth house,

00:15:57.480 --> 00:15:59.110 align:middle line:84%
we have to pay
attention to them.

00:15:59.110 --> 00:16:00.200 align:middle line:90%
We have to look at them.

00:16:00.200 --> 00:16:02.690 align:middle line:84%
We have to see how
they impact the chart.

00:16:02.690 --> 00:16:05.870 align:middle line:84%
Of course we're going to get
into angles later, but where

00:16:05.870 --> 00:16:08.020 align:middle line:84%
those angles show up and
line up with other planets

00:16:08.020 --> 00:16:08.870 align:middle line:90%
in the chart.

00:16:08.870 --> 00:16:12.160 align:middle line:84%
But let me give you an
example of a fifth house Leo.

00:16:12.160 --> 00:16:14.520 align:middle line:84%
Let's say there's Saturn
in the fifth house.

00:16:14.520 --> 00:16:17.270 align:middle line:84%
Now, traditionally,
Saturn in the fifth house

00:16:17.270 --> 00:16:19.930 align:middle line:84%
would show that
an individual may

00:16:19.930 --> 00:16:23.590 align:middle line:84%
have a difficult time having
a child in their lives,

00:16:23.590 --> 00:16:28.480 align:middle line:84%
especially if the person happens
to be a female or a woman.

00:16:28.480 --> 00:16:31.830 align:middle line:84%
Or if they don't have a
difficult time having a child--

00:16:31.830 --> 00:16:35.319 align:middle line:84%
because Saturn represents
limitation and contraction--

00:16:35.319 --> 00:16:37.610 align:middle line:84%
they can certainly have a
difficult time with children.

00:16:37.610 --> 00:16:40.290 align:middle line:84%
And raising the child may
not be the easiest thing.

00:16:40.290 --> 00:16:42.340 align:middle line:84%
Or they may have a
difficult time in labor.

00:16:42.340 --> 00:16:44.890 align:middle line:84%
So this is one
manifestation, one aspect

00:16:44.890 --> 00:16:48.070 align:middle line:84%
of how we see Saturn
in the fifth house.

00:16:48.070 --> 00:16:50.010 align:middle line:84%
Or they may have a
difficult time in romance.

00:16:50.010 --> 00:16:53.270 align:middle line:84%
They may see love and romance
as something very serious.

00:16:53.270 --> 00:16:57.800 align:middle line:84%
So they have to approach
from a very methodical way.

00:16:57.800 --> 00:16:59.290 align:middle line:84%
They may not have
a lot of fun when

00:16:59.290 --> 00:17:02.560 align:middle line:84%
it comes to romance or
creativity or their passions.

00:17:02.560 --> 00:17:04.880 align:middle line:84%
Another, more positive
manifestation--

00:17:04.880 --> 00:17:09.560 align:middle line:84%
let's say their sun is
there, their sun sign.

00:17:09.560 --> 00:17:11.050 align:middle line:84%
And so that would
be, again, what

00:17:11.050 --> 00:17:14.970 align:middle line:84%
we'd call accidental exultation,
because the sun rules

00:17:14.970 --> 00:17:16.440 align:middle line:90%
the sign of Leo.

00:17:16.440 --> 00:17:19.410 align:middle line:84%
Therefore, the fifth house
would be accidentally exalted,

00:17:19.410 --> 00:17:22.160 align:middle line:84%
so we would have almost
like a double Leo energy.

00:17:22.160 --> 00:17:25.359 align:middle line:84%
This would be an individual who
would be very expansive, very

00:17:25.359 --> 00:17:29.090 align:middle line:84%
passionate, really creative,
would have a real joie

00:17:29.090 --> 00:17:30.510 align:middle line:90%
de vivre with life.

00:17:30.510 --> 00:17:33.930 align:middle line:84%
And as it relates to the
evolution of the chart, what

00:17:33.930 --> 00:17:36.830 align:middle line:84%
we have here is,
again, the individual

00:17:36.830 --> 00:17:40.560 align:middle line:84%
now coming into the powers
of their creativity,

00:17:40.560 --> 00:17:41.870 align:middle line:90%
and actually falling in love.

00:17:41.870 --> 00:17:44.370 align:middle line:84%
This is the house where
people fall in love.

00:17:44.370 --> 00:17:47.300 align:middle line:84%
So here you have the roots,
and you step up from the roots,

00:17:47.300 --> 00:17:49.150 align:middle line:84%
you step into the
world, boy meets girl,

00:17:49.150 --> 00:17:50.940 align:middle line:90%
girl meets boy, boy meets boy.

00:17:50.940 --> 00:17:54.590 align:middle line:84%
Whatever that is, it's
happening in the fifth house.

00:17:54.590 --> 00:17:57.630 align:middle line:84%
It's the house of first love,
first kiss, first contact,

00:17:57.630 --> 00:17:59.690 align:middle line:90%
first embrace, all that stuff.

00:17:59.690 --> 00:18:00.860 align:middle line:90%
Now we're moving.

00:18:00.860 --> 00:18:02.960 align:middle line:84%
We're moving further
and further away

00:18:02.960 --> 00:18:07.330 align:middle line:84%
from this point of arrival
in the first house.

00:18:07.330 --> 00:18:09.840 align:middle line:84%
So that takes us
into the sixth house.

00:18:09.840 --> 00:18:12.455 align:middle line:84%
Now we've fallen in love,
we've had our first kiss,

00:18:12.455 --> 00:18:15.250 align:middle line:84%
our first embrace,
whatever those things are.

00:18:15.250 --> 00:18:18.579 align:middle line:84%
We understand kind of a
creative power, to some extent.

00:18:18.579 --> 00:18:20.120 align:middle line:84%
But now we come into
the sixth house.

00:18:20.120 --> 00:18:21.495 align:middle line:84%
Things start to
get a little more

00:18:21.495 --> 00:18:23.050 align:middle line:90%
serious in the sixth house.

00:18:23.050 --> 00:18:26.590 align:middle line:84%
This is the house of Virgo,
the purist, efficiency, logic.

00:18:26.590 --> 00:18:30.730 align:middle line:84%
In my world, my astrological
world, it the house of purpose.

00:18:30.730 --> 00:18:32.130 align:middle line:90%
It is the house of Dharma.

00:18:32.130 --> 00:18:34.370 align:middle line:90%
It is the house of healing.

00:18:34.370 --> 00:18:37.740 align:middle line:84%
It is the raison d'etre
of the chart in some ways.

00:18:37.740 --> 00:18:41.420 align:middle line:84%
If people have planets
in the sixth house,

00:18:41.420 --> 00:18:44.340 align:middle line:84%
they have a very
important role to fulfill,

00:18:44.340 --> 00:18:46.090 align:middle line:84%
in terms of whatever
those planets are,

00:18:46.090 --> 00:18:48.240 align:middle line:84%
whatever their sign
is in, in terms

00:18:48.240 --> 00:18:53.030 align:middle line:84%
of it being a type of expression
that they need to manifest

00:18:53.030 --> 00:18:59.010 align:middle line:84%
as a work, as a vocation, as a
potential, where they can learn

00:18:59.010 --> 00:19:04.620 align:middle line:84%
to serve and add their energy
to this collective experience.

00:19:04.620 --> 00:19:07.840 align:middle line:84%
And sometimes it can also
indicate, occasionally,

00:19:07.840 --> 00:19:11.510 align:middle line:84%
troubles with health, since
Virgo rules the sixth house.

00:19:11.510 --> 00:19:14.260 align:middle line:84%
I look at the health issues
more in terms of transits,

00:19:14.260 --> 00:19:17.540 align:middle line:84%
although you can certainly
see them in the natal chart.

00:19:17.540 --> 00:19:19.340 align:middle line:84%
But as far as-- let
me give you an example

00:19:19.340 --> 00:19:23.380 align:middle line:84%
of something in the
planet in the sixth house.

00:19:23.380 --> 00:19:30.040 align:middle line:84%
Let's say, how about
Uranus, an unusual planet

00:19:30.040 --> 00:19:31.052 align:middle line:90%
for the sixth house.

00:19:31.052 --> 00:19:32.510 align:middle line:84%
That would mean
that the person who

00:19:32.510 --> 00:19:34.650 align:middle line:84%
has Uranus in the
sixth house would have,

00:19:34.650 --> 00:19:37.620 align:middle line:84%
in some ways, an unusual kind
of work-- that they would

00:19:37.620 --> 00:19:42.050 align:middle line:84%
be involved in some form
of potentially healing,

00:19:42.050 --> 00:19:44.960 align:middle line:84%
but it would be healing from
kind of an outside perspective.

00:19:44.960 --> 00:19:48.130 align:middle line:84%
It might be some form
of spiritual healing,

00:19:48.130 --> 00:19:50.340 align:middle line:84%
or some form of
technological healing,

00:19:50.340 --> 00:19:53.970 align:middle line:84%
where they're playing with,
maybe, Hulda Clark, or rife

00:19:53.970 --> 00:19:56.680 align:middle line:84%
machines, or things
along those lines.

00:19:56.680 --> 00:19:59.200 align:middle line:84%
Or maybe it's much
more mainstream.

00:19:59.200 --> 00:20:01.690 align:middle line:84%
They become a
radiation technologist,

00:20:01.690 --> 00:20:03.670 align:middle line:84%
which would be
apropos for somebody

00:20:03.670 --> 00:20:05.410 align:middle line:90%
with Uranus in the sixth house.

00:20:05.410 --> 00:20:09.380 align:middle line:84%
But it would certainly be a type
of work that would be unusual,

00:20:09.380 --> 00:20:12.290 align:middle line:84%
or slightly outside the
mainstream, or alternative.

00:20:12.290 --> 00:20:14.410 align:middle line:84%
Their contribution
may not always

00:20:14.410 --> 00:20:16.950 align:middle line:84%
be easily understood
either, but as again, it

00:20:16.950 --> 00:20:18.870 align:middle line:84%
relates to the
evolution of the chart,

00:20:18.870 --> 00:20:20.790 align:middle line:84%
we've fallen in love
here, we've experienced

00:20:20.790 --> 00:20:22.417 align:middle line:84%
our creative powers,
maybe we've even

00:20:22.417 --> 00:20:24.250 align:middle line:84%
had our heart broken,
which could take place

00:20:24.250 --> 00:20:25.260 align:middle line:90%
in the fifth house.

00:20:25.260 --> 00:20:28.130 align:middle line:84%
In the sixth house,
this is where we learn.

00:20:28.130 --> 00:20:29.990 align:middle line:84%
This is where we
find our purpose.

00:20:29.990 --> 00:20:31.920 align:middle line:84%
This is where we
find our vocation.

00:20:31.920 --> 00:20:34.130 align:middle line:84%
And to me, this
house in some ways

00:20:34.130 --> 00:20:37.010 align:middle line:84%
represents high school
or secondary school,

00:20:37.010 --> 00:20:43.000 align:middle line:84%
where you begin to master some
of the basic and fundamental

00:20:43.000 --> 00:20:45.410 align:middle line:84%
systems of learning reading,
writing, and arithmetic.

00:20:45.410 --> 00:20:47.350 align:middle line:84%
But now you're looking
for something else.

00:20:47.350 --> 00:20:49.830 align:middle line:84%
You're looking to find
what you're good at.

00:20:49.830 --> 00:20:51.000 align:middle line:90%
That's the sixth house.

00:20:51.000 --> 00:20:53.960 align:middle line:84%
And in that place,
what do we do?

00:20:53.960 --> 00:20:55.380 align:middle line:90%
We wind up meeting people.

00:20:55.380 --> 00:20:56.630 align:middle line:90%
We meet people in high school.

00:20:56.630 --> 00:20:58.260 align:middle line:90%
We have high school sweethearts.

00:20:58.260 --> 00:21:00.240 align:middle line:90%
We begin to have relationships.

00:21:00.240 --> 00:21:01.410 align:middle line:90%
And we fall in love again.

00:21:01.410 --> 00:21:03.690 align:middle line:84%
We fall in love when
we form relationships,

00:21:03.690 --> 00:21:04.910 align:middle line:90%
and that's the seventh house.

00:21:04.910 --> 00:21:05.930 align:middle line:90%
That's Libra.

00:21:05.930 --> 00:21:10.492 align:middle line:84%
And here, we've come 180 degrees
all the way around the chart.

00:21:10.492 --> 00:21:11.700 align:middle line:90%
All the way around the wheel.

00:21:11.700 --> 00:21:12.620 align:middle line:90%
So we're halfway now.

00:21:12.620 --> 00:21:13.810 align:middle line:90%
We're halfway done.

00:21:13.810 --> 00:21:16.990 align:middle line:84%
And what's fascinating is
we've arrived with Aries.

00:21:16.990 --> 00:21:20.680 align:middle line:84%
We were just this pure,
undifferentiated expression

00:21:20.680 --> 00:21:22.250 align:middle line:90%
of spirit and will.

00:21:22.250 --> 00:21:23.770 align:middle line:90%
We just exist, right?

00:21:23.770 --> 00:21:26.165 align:middle line:84%
Now when we get to the
seventh house, uh-oh.

00:21:26.165 --> 00:21:27.290 align:middle line:90%
There's somebody else here.

00:21:27.290 --> 00:21:29.970 align:middle line:84%
There's another person I
have to take into account.

00:21:29.970 --> 00:21:31.200 align:middle line:90%
There is the other.

00:21:31.200 --> 00:21:33.710 align:middle line:84%
And that's what Libra is
all about-- the peacemaker,

00:21:33.710 --> 00:21:35.070 align:middle line:90%
harmony, balance.

00:21:35.070 --> 00:21:36.850 align:middle line:90%
It's where we interact.

00:21:36.850 --> 00:21:39.382 align:middle line:84%
And we find somebody, and
we say to that person hey,

00:21:39.382 --> 00:21:40.590 align:middle line:90%
I really want to be with you.

00:21:40.590 --> 00:21:41.673 align:middle line:90%
I want to figure this out.

00:21:41.673 --> 00:21:42.760 align:middle line:90%
I want to work this out.

00:21:42.760 --> 00:21:44.980 align:middle line:90%
Let's join our lives together.

00:21:44.980 --> 00:21:47.460 align:middle line:90%
Let's create some form of union.

00:21:47.460 --> 00:21:49.000 align:middle line:90%
It happens in the seventh house.

00:21:49.000 --> 00:21:52.580 align:middle line:84%
Now it doesn't always have
to be the type of union

00:21:52.580 --> 00:21:57.880 align:middle line:84%
where it manifests in some
form of intimate relationship.

00:21:57.880 --> 00:22:00.220 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes there can be
business relationships

00:22:00.220 --> 00:22:01.920 align:middle line:84%
and contractual
relationships that

00:22:01.920 --> 00:22:03.990 align:middle line:84%
take place in the seventh
house, because Libra

00:22:03.990 --> 00:22:05.630 align:middle line:90%
does rule contracts.

00:22:05.630 --> 00:22:08.640 align:middle line:84%
However, I've seen this
in a lot of charts,

00:22:08.640 --> 00:22:10.640 align:middle line:84%
and I've read a lot of
charts, that when there's

00:22:10.640 --> 00:22:13.350 align:middle line:84%
activity in the seventh
house, it almost always gets

00:22:13.350 --> 00:22:15.710 align:middle line:84%
played out in terms of
interpersonal relationships,

00:22:15.710 --> 00:22:18.610 align:middle line:84%
love relationships
and partnering.

00:22:18.610 --> 00:22:20.420 align:middle line:90%
Now here's what happens.

00:22:20.420 --> 00:22:22.890 align:middle line:84%
Let me give you another
example of a planet

00:22:22.890 --> 00:22:24.570 align:middle line:90%
in the seventh house.

00:22:24.570 --> 00:22:28.060 align:middle line:84%
Let's bring in Neptune--
Neptune in the seventh house.

00:22:28.060 --> 00:22:30.270 align:middle line:84%
Neptune is a fascinating
planet in that

00:22:30.270 --> 00:22:33.650 align:middle line:84%
it can be really fuzzy,
really out of focus.

00:22:33.650 --> 00:22:37.190 align:middle line:84%
And it can bring with it a sense
of possibility and divinity

00:22:37.190 --> 00:22:39.920 align:middle line:84%
and spirituality,
but also illusion

00:22:39.920 --> 00:22:42.340 align:middle line:84%
and not being able to
see things clearly,

00:22:42.340 --> 00:22:44.540 align:middle line:84%
not being able to
understand things clearly.

00:22:44.540 --> 00:22:46.530 align:middle line:84%
There may be some
form of projection

00:22:46.530 --> 00:22:48.570 align:middle line:90%
that goes on with Neptune.

00:22:48.570 --> 00:22:50.726 align:middle line:84%
So having Neptune
in the seventh house

00:22:50.726 --> 00:22:53.170 align:middle line:84%
might make it difficult
for the individual

00:22:53.170 --> 00:22:56.320 align:middle line:84%
to see who they're
involved with on a really

00:22:56.320 --> 00:22:58.800 align:middle line:90%
clear and sound basis.

00:22:58.800 --> 00:23:03.030 align:middle line:84%
And sometimes that can manifest
in things like dependencies,

00:23:03.030 --> 00:23:08.550 align:middle line:84%
codependencies, drug addictions,
and being anchored to somebody

00:23:08.550 --> 00:23:12.250 align:middle line:84%
whom you really are
taking up more space

00:23:12.250 --> 00:23:14.600 align:middle line:84%
and energy in your
life than they should.

00:23:14.600 --> 00:23:17.270 align:middle line:84%
So if you know somebody who has
Neptune in the seventh house,

00:23:17.270 --> 00:23:20.380 align:middle line:84%
and are constantly going through
challenges in a relationship,

00:23:20.380 --> 00:23:21.850 align:middle line:90%
that's one of the reasons why.

00:23:21.850 --> 00:23:23.860 align:middle line:84%
Now ultimately, the
distillation of that

00:23:23.860 --> 00:23:25.870 align:middle line:84%
would be kind of
finding a soul mate

00:23:25.870 --> 00:23:27.624 align:middle line:84%
in the seventh house
with Neptune there.

00:23:27.624 --> 00:23:29.790 align:middle line:84%
But that can be really
difficult and tough sledding.

00:23:29.790 --> 00:23:31.736 align:middle line:84%
Even when you find
somebody who theoretically

00:23:31.736 --> 00:23:33.735 align:middle line:84%
would be your soul mate,
it's not always a match

00:23:33.735 --> 00:23:34.760 align:middle line:90%
made in heaven.

00:23:34.760 --> 00:23:38.210 align:middle line:84%
Now what happens here
is in the seventh house,

00:23:38.210 --> 00:23:42.190 align:middle line:84%
again, we partner,
we connect, we bond.

00:23:42.190 --> 00:23:43.260 align:middle line:90%
And then what happens?

00:23:43.260 --> 00:23:45.412 align:middle line:90%
Well, we go to the eighth house.

00:23:45.412 --> 00:23:46.620 align:middle line:90%
And that's where we have sex.

00:23:46.620 --> 00:23:48.360 align:middle line:90%
That's where we have intimacy.

00:23:48.360 --> 00:23:52.579 align:middle line:84%
That's where we take away-- the
eighth house is fascinating.

00:23:52.579 --> 00:23:54.370 align:middle line:84%
I'm utterly fascinated
by the eighth house,

00:23:54.370 --> 00:23:58.430 align:middle line:84%
because this, to me, is the
continental shelf of the chart.

00:23:58.430 --> 00:24:00.920 align:middle line:84%
This is where we walk off
the edge of the chart,

00:24:00.920 --> 00:24:02.750 align:middle line:84%
usually with
somebody else's hand.

00:24:02.750 --> 00:24:04.170 align:middle line:84%
We walk off the
edge of the chart,

00:24:04.170 --> 00:24:07.180 align:middle line:84%
and we are in a
psychic zone that

00:24:07.180 --> 00:24:09.770 align:middle line:84%
is filled with depth, that
is filled with mystery.

00:24:09.770 --> 00:24:11.450 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes they're
out of our depth,

00:24:11.450 --> 00:24:15.760 align:middle line:84%
especially when we get into the
psychic terrain of sexuality.

00:24:15.760 --> 00:24:19.197 align:middle line:84%
Because that's the next-- this
is the next kind of step here.

00:24:19.197 --> 00:24:20.155 align:middle line:90%
This is the next phase.

00:24:20.155 --> 00:24:23.810 align:middle line:84%
This is the next iteration,
the next cycle for partnering

00:24:23.810 --> 00:24:25.980 align:middle line:90%
and Libra in the seventh house.

00:24:25.980 --> 00:24:29.500 align:middle line:84%
It's where we become confused
in terms of our identity.

00:24:29.500 --> 00:24:32.900 align:middle line:84%
It's where two people begin
to merge and they're one,

00:24:32.900 --> 00:24:35.110 align:middle line:84%
and they're not
one, and who are you

00:24:35.110 --> 00:24:38.530 align:middle line:84%
and who am I. Then we get into
things like power struggles

00:24:38.530 --> 00:24:41.840 align:middle line:84%
and power plays, and
all the hidden complexes

00:24:41.840 --> 00:24:45.870 align:middle line:84%
and obsessions that are
tucked away in our life,

00:24:45.870 --> 00:24:49.060 align:middle line:84%
but tend to come out in
the intimate clinches

00:24:49.060 --> 00:24:50.920 align:middle line:90%
in relationship and relating.

00:24:50.920 --> 00:24:53.330 align:middle line:84%
And it all happens right
here in the eighth house.

00:24:53.330 --> 00:24:55.290 align:middle line:84%
So what else takes place
in the eighth house?

00:24:55.290 --> 00:24:56.880 align:middle line:84%
Well, to untangle
all that stuff,

00:24:56.880 --> 00:24:59.820 align:middle line:84%
you've got to go to
a psychotherapist,

00:24:59.820 --> 00:25:01.230 align:middle line:90%
or you go to a counselor.

00:25:01.230 --> 00:25:03.300 align:middle line:84%
In some cases, you
go to a shaman.

00:25:03.300 --> 00:25:05.500 align:middle line:84%
And that's where
you begin to try

00:25:05.500 --> 00:25:09.270 align:middle line:84%
to get a map to understand
the psychological terrain

00:25:09.270 --> 00:25:10.670 align:middle line:90%
of the eighth house.

00:25:10.670 --> 00:25:15.220 align:middle line:84%
You begin to move through
sort of this Orphic depth

00:25:15.220 --> 00:25:18.150 align:middle line:84%
in the labyrinthian nature
of the eighth house.

00:25:18.150 --> 00:25:21.060 align:middle line:84%
You can emerge on the
other side as a more

00:25:21.060 --> 00:25:24.580 align:middle line:84%
psychically whole and
individuated person.

00:25:24.580 --> 00:25:27.070 align:middle line:84%
Now in a perfect
world, what would

00:25:27.070 --> 00:25:30.190 align:middle line:84%
happen in the eighth house
is that you would have some

00:25:30.190 --> 00:25:33.720 align:middle line:84%
of gnosis, kind of contact
where all of a sudden,

00:25:33.720 --> 00:25:38.225 align:middle line:84%
you pass through this trial
of darkness and unknowing.

00:25:38.225 --> 00:25:40.310 align:middle line:84%
And then you come to
a point of clarity.

00:25:40.310 --> 00:25:42.140 align:middle line:84%
You come to a point
of realization.

00:25:42.140 --> 00:25:44.790 align:middle line:84%
And all of a sudden, you're
a transformed individual.

00:25:44.790 --> 00:25:47.900 align:middle line:84%
And that is the strategy
for the eighth house.

00:25:47.900 --> 00:25:49.840 align:middle line:84%
Now sometimes you can
get derailed there,

00:25:49.840 --> 00:25:51.490 align:middle line:84%
because the eighth
house represents

00:25:51.490 --> 00:25:54.260 align:middle line:90%
drugs and alcohol and sex.

00:25:54.260 --> 00:25:58.740 align:middle line:84%
So that's all part of
this psychic labyrinth

00:25:58.740 --> 00:26:01.090 align:middle line:84%
that the individual
needs to go through.

00:26:01.090 --> 00:26:04.480 align:middle line:84%
Let's use a planet
and stick it in there,

00:26:04.480 --> 00:26:07.140 align:middle line:84%
and give you an example of
how a planet might show up

00:26:07.140 --> 00:26:10.540 align:middle line:90%
in the eighth house.

00:26:10.540 --> 00:26:11.750 align:middle line:90%
How about Venus?

00:26:11.750 --> 00:26:13.480 align:middle line:84%
Let's take Venus in
the eighth house.

00:26:13.480 --> 00:26:15.510 align:middle line:84%
Now I have been
with people who've

00:26:15.510 --> 00:26:19.170 align:middle line:84%
had Venus in the eighth house,
and it's really difficult

00:26:19.170 --> 00:26:22.810 align:middle line:84%
to get a handle on how
they feel about you.

00:26:22.810 --> 00:26:25.710 align:middle line:84%
Because the eighth
house is a hidden house.

00:26:25.710 --> 00:26:27.810 align:middle line:84%
The fourth, the
eighth, and the 12th--

00:26:27.810 --> 00:26:29.410 align:middle line:90%
they're all hidden houses.

00:26:29.410 --> 00:26:32.580 align:middle line:84%
And I like to use these
analogies for the three water

00:26:32.580 --> 00:26:33.280 align:middle line:90%
houses.

00:26:33.280 --> 00:26:35.952 align:middle line:90%
The fourth house is like a pond.

00:26:35.952 --> 00:26:36.660 align:middle line:90%
It's like a well.

00:26:36.660 --> 00:26:39.700 align:middle line:84%
These are all very kind of
agrarian images, very close

00:26:39.700 --> 00:26:40.200 align:middle line:90%
to home.

00:26:40.200 --> 00:26:41.460 align:middle line:90%
You can tap into them.

00:26:41.460 --> 00:26:44.170 align:middle line:84%
They're part of your nurturing
experience in the fourth house.

00:26:44.170 --> 00:26:47.030 align:middle line:84%
The eighth house
I liken to things

00:26:47.030 --> 00:26:48.690 align:middle line:90%
like Loch Ness or Lake Shasta.

00:26:48.690 --> 00:26:49.930 align:middle line:90%
These are lakes.

00:26:49.930 --> 00:26:52.990 align:middle line:84%
These are large bodies
of water, some of them

00:26:52.990 --> 00:26:54.710 align:middle line:84%
they haven't found
the bottom of.

00:26:54.710 --> 00:26:58.170 align:middle line:84%
So there's a mystery that's
connected to the eighth house.

00:26:58.170 --> 00:26:59.680 align:middle line:90%
You can walk into it.

00:26:59.680 --> 00:27:02.770 align:middle line:84%
You can get some kind of
understanding and depth

00:27:02.770 --> 00:27:06.000 align:middle line:90%
with it at points in time.

00:27:06.000 --> 00:27:10.100 align:middle line:84%
It goes into a very
darker and a place that

00:27:10.100 --> 00:27:13.330 align:middle line:84%
has a depth that might
even be unfathomable.

00:27:13.330 --> 00:27:19.830 align:middle line:84%
But still, it has much more
of a foundation, and more

00:27:19.830 --> 00:27:23.800 align:middle line:84%
of a sense of grounding
than the 12th house, which

00:27:23.800 --> 00:27:25.957 align:middle line:84%
is ruled by Pisces,
which is the ocean.

00:27:25.957 --> 00:27:27.290 align:middle line:90%
And we'll get into Pisces later.

00:27:27.290 --> 00:27:29.150 align:middle line:90%
But those are my metaphors.

00:27:29.150 --> 00:27:33.000 align:middle line:84%
Pond, well near the home,
deep lakes, and then

00:27:33.000 --> 00:27:35.170 align:middle line:90%
the ocean for the 12th house.

00:27:35.170 --> 00:27:36.710 align:middle line:84%
So Venus in the
eighth house would

00:27:36.710 --> 00:27:42.060 align:middle line:84%
be somebody who at times
have a secret relationship.

00:27:42.060 --> 00:27:44.590 align:middle line:84%
They may be involved
with somebody

00:27:44.590 --> 00:27:49.010 align:middle line:84%
who is-- that they can't tell
the rest of the world about.

00:27:49.010 --> 00:27:50.690 align:middle line:84%
And again, since
this is my show,

00:27:50.690 --> 00:27:53.200 align:middle line:90%
I'll be transparent with you.

00:27:53.200 --> 00:27:54.880 align:middle line:84%
When I got married,
I got married

00:27:54.880 --> 00:27:57.490 align:middle line:84%
with-- I'm not married anymore--
but when I got married,

00:27:57.490 --> 00:27:59.410 align:middle line:84%
I got married with
somebody I worked with.

00:27:59.410 --> 00:28:02.727 align:middle line:84%
And we didn't really
know if it was cool

00:28:02.727 --> 00:28:04.310 align:middle line:84%
that people knew
that we were married.

00:28:04.310 --> 00:28:06.270 align:middle line:84%
We weren't sure if
people were supposed

00:28:06.270 --> 00:28:08.680 align:middle line:84%
to get married and
work at the same place.

00:28:08.680 --> 00:28:09.510 align:middle line:90%
So what happened?

00:28:09.510 --> 00:28:12.140 align:middle line:84%
She didn't tell anybody
for about six months.

00:28:12.140 --> 00:28:13.620 align:middle line:90%
It was our secret.

00:28:13.620 --> 00:28:16.440 align:middle line:84%
So that's Venus in the eighth
house becoming manifest,

00:28:16.440 --> 00:28:17.660 align:middle line:90%
at least in the chart.

00:28:17.660 --> 00:28:20.920 align:middle line:84%
That's an example of how
Venus can work on one level.

00:28:20.920 --> 00:28:24.150 align:middle line:84%
On another level, you may not
necessarily know or understand

00:28:24.150 --> 00:28:25.720 align:middle line:84%
how a person really
feels about you

00:28:25.720 --> 00:28:27.550 align:middle line:84%
with Venus in the
eighth house as well.

00:28:27.550 --> 00:28:29.780 align:middle line:84%
So the eighth house
is a house of mystery.

00:28:29.780 --> 00:28:32.880 align:middle line:84%
And there's one kind of example
of how a planet shows up there.

00:28:32.880 --> 00:28:34.480 align:middle line:84%
But let's just say,
for instance, you

00:28:34.480 --> 00:28:36.090 align:middle line:84%
go through the
eighth house and you

00:28:36.090 --> 00:28:38.170 align:middle line:84%
have this kind of
psychic gnosis.

00:28:38.170 --> 00:28:39.410 align:middle line:90%
You break through.

00:28:39.410 --> 00:28:41.960 align:middle line:84%
And all of a sudden, this
really numinous experience

00:28:41.960 --> 00:28:45.700 align:middle line:84%
becomes manifest to you, and
you have the big picture.

00:28:45.700 --> 00:28:46.580 align:middle line:90%
Well, guess what?

00:28:46.580 --> 00:28:49.510 align:middle line:90%
The big picture is Sagittarius.

00:28:49.510 --> 00:28:51.720 align:middle line:90%
It Is the ninth house.

00:28:51.720 --> 00:28:55.280 align:middle line:84%
Let's use the eighth house
and, let's say, ayahuasca,

00:28:55.280 --> 00:28:56.510 align:middle line:90%
as an example.

00:28:56.510 --> 00:28:58.190 align:middle line:84%
You go through the
ayahuasca experience,

00:28:58.190 --> 00:29:02.690 align:middle line:84%
and all of a sudden you have a
much larger religious context,

00:29:02.690 --> 00:29:05.850 align:middle line:84%
or a religious sort
of paradigm that you

00:29:05.850 --> 00:29:07.830 align:middle line:90%
can bring to the surface.

00:29:07.830 --> 00:29:11.330 align:middle line:84%
For instance, I see this
as being very much related

00:29:11.330 --> 00:29:15.630 align:middle line:84%
to Moses being on Mount Sinai,
having the Ten Commandments

00:29:15.630 --> 00:29:19.600 align:middle line:84%
experience literally
away from everybody else,

00:29:19.600 --> 00:29:21.870 align:middle line:84%
at the cusp of the eighth
and the ninth house,

00:29:21.870 --> 00:29:24.410 align:middle line:84%
and then coming out into the
ninth house with Sagittarius

00:29:24.410 --> 00:29:27.540 align:middle line:84%
and coming up with
religious law or sacred law.

00:29:27.540 --> 00:29:31.110 align:middle line:84%
Here we have the feeling,
the experience, the moment,

00:29:31.110 --> 00:29:32.810 align:middle line:90%
the psychic realization.

00:29:32.810 --> 00:29:35.480 align:middle line:84%
And now as a result, we
go to the ninth house

00:29:35.480 --> 00:29:38.250 align:middle line:84%
and we say OK, we've
got all this stuff.

00:29:38.250 --> 00:29:40.610 align:middle line:84%
Now we've got to
put names to it.

00:29:40.610 --> 00:29:42.900 align:middle line:84%
Now we've got to
put a system to it.

00:29:42.900 --> 00:29:46.280 align:middle line:84%
Now we've got to ascribe
some kind of meaning to this,

00:29:46.280 --> 00:29:48.460 align:middle line:84%
because we have to bring
it back into the world.

00:29:48.460 --> 00:29:50.420 align:middle line:84%
And we're moving
further and further out.

00:29:50.420 --> 00:29:52.490 align:middle line:90%
It's a more transpersonality.

00:29:52.490 --> 00:29:54.980 align:middle line:84%
This is the psychic realm
and the unconscious.

00:29:54.980 --> 00:29:58.300 align:middle line:84%
The ninth house
represents churches.

00:29:58.300 --> 00:30:00.800 align:middle line:90%
It represents religion.

00:30:00.800 --> 00:30:02.910 align:middle line:90%
It represents law.

00:30:02.910 --> 00:30:08.522 align:middle line:84%
It represents philosophy,
nature, foreign travel, sports.

00:30:08.522 --> 00:30:09.980 align:middle line:84%
That's all part of
the ninth house.

00:30:09.980 --> 00:30:12.040 align:middle line:90%
It's very expansive.

00:30:12.040 --> 00:30:15.140 align:middle line:84%
But to me, it is the
upper room of the chart.

00:30:15.140 --> 00:30:19.780 align:middle line:84%
And it is the area
of the chart where

00:30:19.780 --> 00:30:22.430 align:middle line:84%
we come in contact,
in some ways,

00:30:22.430 --> 00:30:25.010 align:middle line:84%
with our higher self
because of the elevation

00:30:25.010 --> 00:30:26.400 align:middle line:90%
of the ninth house.

00:30:26.400 --> 00:30:29.845 align:middle line:84%
So when we have this numinous
experience in the eighth

00:30:29.845 --> 00:30:31.430 align:middle line:84%
and we come into the
ninth, it's like,

00:30:31.430 --> 00:30:33.700 align:middle line:90%
OK, let's put a name to it.

00:30:33.700 --> 00:30:35.080 align:middle line:90%
Let's create a system.

00:30:35.080 --> 00:30:36.580 align:middle line:90%
Let's create a university.

00:30:36.580 --> 00:30:37.830 align:middle line:90%
Let's create law.

00:30:37.830 --> 00:30:42.030 align:middle line:84%
Let's create sacred law,
religion, all those things

00:30:42.030 --> 00:30:43.920 align:middle line:84%
that are very ninth
house related.

00:30:43.920 --> 00:30:47.230 align:middle line:84%
It's a very expansive house,
and if you have a planet

00:30:47.230 --> 00:30:49.950 align:middle line:84%
or know somebody who has
planets in the ninth house,

00:30:49.950 --> 00:30:53.150 align:middle line:84%
they tend to be very
philosophical people, or people

00:30:53.150 --> 00:30:57.160 align:middle line:84%
that like to look at life
from a heightened perspective.

00:30:57.160 --> 00:30:59.545 align:middle line:84%
Let's use another planet
in there for an example.

00:30:59.545 --> 00:31:02.400 align:middle line:90%


00:31:02.400 --> 00:31:03.980 align:middle line:90%
How about the moon?

00:31:03.980 --> 00:31:06.210 align:middle line:84%
Let's put the moon
in the ninth house.

00:31:06.210 --> 00:31:08.880 align:middle line:84%
Somebody that has
a moon ninth house

00:31:08.880 --> 00:31:14.190 align:middle line:84%
could be very engaged in
a personal kind of quest,

00:31:14.190 --> 00:31:16.370 align:middle line:84%
that they would
be, in some ways,

00:31:16.370 --> 00:31:23.130 align:middle line:84%
on this very intuitive, very,
very at times emotional,

00:31:23.130 --> 00:31:26.720 align:middle line:84%
magnetic journey through life,
that they would go through kind

00:31:26.720 --> 00:31:32.090 align:middle line:84%
of a cyclical sort
of development,

00:31:32.090 --> 00:31:34.620 align:middle line:84%
in terms of who they
are, where they're going.

00:31:34.620 --> 00:31:38.650 align:middle line:84%
They would peel away and shed
their belief systems at times,

00:31:38.650 --> 00:31:40.200 align:middle line:84%
because that's
what the moon does.

00:31:40.200 --> 00:31:42.970 align:middle line:84%
The moon is always
shifting and phasing,

00:31:42.970 --> 00:31:45.350 align:middle line:84%
and moving into
different cycles.

00:31:45.350 --> 00:31:48.670 align:middle line:84%
So a ninth house moon
would be an individual that

00:31:48.670 --> 00:31:54.440 align:middle line:84%
is not necessarily trying to
find a direct access to truth,

00:31:54.440 --> 00:31:58.800 align:middle line:84%
or direct access to a
philosophical position,

00:31:58.800 --> 00:32:02.180 align:middle line:84%
but something that would be
ultimately more intuitive,

00:32:02.180 --> 00:32:05.380 align:middle line:84%
that they would try to
merge this whole concept

00:32:05.380 --> 00:32:09.370 align:middle line:84%
of the higher mind
with their instinct

00:32:09.370 --> 00:32:12.680 align:middle line:84%
and with their intuition,
and to kind of bring them

00:32:12.680 --> 00:32:14.880 align:middle line:84%
both into focus
and into one being.

00:32:14.880 --> 00:32:18.370 align:middle line:84%
Now of course, whatever sign
the moon is in, or Venus is in,

00:32:18.370 --> 00:32:20.550 align:middle line:84%
or any other planet
that I've talked about,

00:32:20.550 --> 00:32:22.390 align:middle line:90%
that will also color this.

00:32:22.390 --> 00:32:26.600 align:middle line:84%
But I'm just giving you kind
of a planetary perspective

00:32:26.600 --> 00:32:29.000 align:middle line:84%
of an object in
one of the houses.

00:32:29.000 --> 00:32:29.980 align:middle line:90%
So here we are.

00:32:29.980 --> 00:32:30.900 align:middle line:90%
Now we're into law.

00:32:30.900 --> 00:32:32.290 align:middle line:90%
Now we're into religion.

00:32:32.290 --> 00:32:33.380 align:middle line:90%
Now we're into philosophy.

00:32:33.380 --> 00:32:34.910 align:middle line:90%
We're into universities.

00:32:34.910 --> 00:32:36.640 align:middle line:84%
We've got all these
wonderful things

00:32:36.640 --> 00:32:40.490 align:middle line:84%
that are in some
ways, control systems

00:32:40.490 --> 00:32:43.790 align:middle line:84%
and organizational
principles, in terms

00:32:43.790 --> 00:32:46.540 align:middle line:84%
of how we can live from
a moral perspective.

00:32:46.540 --> 00:32:47.260 align:middle line:90%
What's next?

00:32:47.260 --> 00:32:49.960 align:middle line:84%
Well, out of that we
have to create society.

00:32:49.960 --> 00:32:51.720 align:middle line:90%
Now we come to the 10th house.

00:32:51.720 --> 00:32:55.700 align:middle line:84%
And here we engage things
like banking, and politics,

00:32:55.700 --> 00:32:59.920 align:middle line:84%
and government, and life
insurance, and skyscrapers,

00:32:59.920 --> 00:33:01.000 align:middle line:90%
and architecture.

00:33:01.000 --> 00:33:03.690 align:middle line:84%
All of them are connected
to the 10th house.

00:33:03.690 --> 00:33:06.570 align:middle line:84%
So you see how we're moving
further and further away.

00:33:06.570 --> 00:33:08.780 align:middle line:84%
We started with the
individual here,

00:33:08.780 --> 00:33:12.440 align:middle line:84%
just showing up, just arriving,
going all the way through here,

00:33:12.440 --> 00:33:15.380 align:middle line:84%
meeting up with another person,
getting into the psychic depths

00:33:15.380 --> 00:33:18.500 align:middle line:84%
and the psychic channel of the
eighth house, coming out of it,

00:33:18.500 --> 00:33:21.230 align:middle line:84%
and then seeing that we've
got to somehow put names

00:33:21.230 --> 00:33:21.890 align:middle line:90%
to this stuff.

00:33:21.890 --> 00:33:24.450 align:middle line:84%
And once we put names to it,
now we get to create a world.

00:33:24.450 --> 00:33:26.180 align:middle line:84%
Now we get to create
a civilization.

00:33:26.180 --> 00:33:27.740 align:middle line:90%
Now we get to create a society.

00:33:27.740 --> 00:33:28.950 align:middle line:90%
That's the 10th house.

00:33:28.950 --> 00:33:32.260 align:middle line:84%
We've come from the individual
all the way to the collective.

00:33:32.260 --> 00:33:34.470 align:middle line:84%
And the current time that
we're living in, really

00:33:34.470 --> 00:33:37.370 align:middle line:84%
Pluto in Capricorn,
which is symbolic

00:33:37.370 --> 00:33:39.510 align:middle line:84%
in a lot of ways
of the 10th house.

00:33:39.510 --> 00:33:41.150 align:middle line:90%
So that's the 10th house.

00:33:41.150 --> 00:33:43.070 align:middle line:90%
It is all about the world.

00:33:43.070 --> 00:33:45.460 align:middle line:84%
And if you have planets
in the 10th house,

00:33:45.460 --> 00:33:49.020 align:middle line:84%
then in a lot of ways, you were
meant to be a public person.

00:33:49.020 --> 00:33:50.620 align:middle line:90%
You are meant to be out there.

00:33:50.620 --> 00:33:54.450 align:middle line:84%
And you are supposed
to be sharing

00:33:54.450 --> 00:33:59.870 align:middle line:84%
whatever manifestation of that
planet is in the 10th house.

00:33:59.870 --> 00:34:01.170 align:middle line:90%
So you want an example?

00:34:01.170 --> 00:34:03.160 align:middle line:90%
I'll use myself for an example.

00:34:03.160 --> 00:34:04.900 align:middle line:84%
I have sun in the
10th house, just

00:34:04.900 --> 00:34:08.560 align:middle line:84%
on the other side of the
mid-heaven, right over here.

00:34:08.560 --> 00:34:12.139 align:middle line:84%
So what I'm doing is I'm
having a public moment with you

00:34:12.139 --> 00:34:14.429 align:middle line:84%
talking about this,
so I'm actually

00:34:14.429 --> 00:34:15.810 align:middle line:90%
working my 10th house out.

00:34:15.810 --> 00:34:17.460 align:middle line:90%
This is what's taking place.

00:34:17.460 --> 00:34:19.489 align:middle line:84%
It's Virgo, I'm
breaking this down,

00:34:19.489 --> 00:34:20.949 align:middle line:90%
I'm being analytical about it.

00:34:20.949 --> 00:34:21.840 align:middle line:90%
So here we are.

00:34:21.840 --> 00:34:24.100 align:middle line:90%
Astrology in Action 101.

00:34:24.100 --> 00:34:26.139 align:middle line:90%
That's sun in the 10th house.

00:34:26.139 --> 00:34:28.122 align:middle line:84%
So if you have sun
in the 10th house,

00:34:28.122 --> 00:34:30.580 align:middle line:84%
you don't necessarily have to
have your own astrology show,

00:34:30.580 --> 00:34:34.699 align:middle line:84%
but in this lifetime,
you need to be out front.

00:34:34.699 --> 00:34:36.969 align:middle line:84%
You need to be able
to share something

00:34:36.969 --> 00:34:39.800 align:middle line:84%
about your own
personal essence that

00:34:39.800 --> 00:34:43.647 align:middle line:84%
is going to be seen and
experienced by other people.

00:34:43.647 --> 00:34:45.980 align:middle line:84%
And let me just give you an
example again, about my life

00:34:45.980 --> 00:34:48.500 align:middle line:84%
and how this has
worked out for me.

00:34:48.500 --> 00:34:50.949 align:middle line:84%
Now for a while, like
back in the '90s,

00:34:50.949 --> 00:34:53.750 align:middle line:84%
I was really involved
in the music world.

00:34:53.750 --> 00:34:57.210 align:middle line:84%
I had a whole other kind of
thing going on with tarot

00:34:57.210 --> 00:34:59.290 align:middle line:84%
and being a psychic
and stuff like that.

00:34:59.290 --> 00:35:01.070 align:middle line:84%
But I was also really
involved in music.

00:35:01.070 --> 00:35:05.590 align:middle line:84%
And one of the things that I
thought that I would be good at

00:35:05.590 --> 00:35:08.790 align:middle line:84%
was I thought I would be
good at being a kind of a PR

00:35:08.790 --> 00:35:11.360 align:middle line:84%
and a marketing person
for some of my friends,

00:35:11.360 --> 00:35:13.280 align:middle line:90%
who are quite good musicians.

00:35:13.280 --> 00:35:15.290 align:middle line:84%
And I was OK with
it, but I was never

00:35:15.290 --> 00:35:17.180 align:middle line:90%
really quite successful with it.

00:35:17.180 --> 00:35:19.750 align:middle line:84%
And the reason why I
was just OK with it

00:35:19.750 --> 00:35:24.010 align:middle line:84%
was because I wasn't living
the sun in the 10th house.

00:35:24.010 --> 00:35:26.950 align:middle line:84%
I was trying to live
somebody else's sun.

00:35:26.950 --> 00:35:30.880 align:middle line:84%
And when I finally realized that
this is where I needed to be,

00:35:30.880 --> 00:35:32.060 align:middle line:90%
my life changed.

00:35:32.060 --> 00:35:35.810 align:middle line:84%
And it became more directed
and more in alignment

00:35:35.810 --> 00:35:36.650 align:middle line:90%
with my chart.

00:35:36.650 --> 00:35:38.670 align:middle line:84%
And that's the
beauty of astrology,

00:35:38.670 --> 00:35:43.340 align:middle line:84%
is that when you finally figure
out and do what you're supposed

00:35:43.340 --> 00:35:45.480 align:middle line:84%
to be doing, you can
see it in the chart.

00:35:45.480 --> 00:35:49.106 align:middle line:84%
And once you do it, and
once you are moving with it

00:35:49.106 --> 00:35:52.270 align:middle line:84%
and grooving with it, then
all of a sudden, other aspects

00:35:52.270 --> 00:35:54.550 align:middle line:84%
of your life begin to
make sense as well.

00:35:54.550 --> 00:35:57.030 align:middle line:84%
So that's a sun in
the 10th house story.

00:35:57.030 --> 00:35:59.250 align:middle line:90%
So here we have society.

00:35:59.250 --> 00:36:04.330 align:middle line:84%
We've got all this money,
we've got all this technology.

00:36:04.330 --> 00:36:05.940 align:middle line:90%
We're civilized.

00:36:05.940 --> 00:36:09.630 align:middle line:84%
And theoretically, in the
grand scheme of things,

00:36:09.630 --> 00:36:11.620 align:middle line:84%
once we reach this
apex, which is

00:36:11.620 --> 00:36:14.900 align:middle line:84%
the top of the pyramid--
that's Capricorn--

00:36:14.900 --> 00:36:16.050 align:middle line:90%
we've reached the top.

00:36:16.050 --> 00:36:17.140 align:middle line:90%
Where we go from there?

00:36:17.140 --> 00:36:19.030 align:middle line:90%
Well, we jump off into space.

00:36:19.030 --> 00:36:21.815 align:middle line:84%
We jump off into the
space of the 11th house.

00:36:21.815 --> 00:36:25.330 align:middle line:84%
And in the 11th house-- which
is this show, obviously--

00:36:25.330 --> 00:36:28.420 align:middle line:84%
it's revolutionary, it's
social change, it's liberation.

00:36:28.420 --> 00:36:29.910 align:middle line:90%
It's the world of tomorrow.

00:36:29.910 --> 00:36:31.530 align:middle line:90%
That's what the 11th house is.

00:36:31.530 --> 00:36:33.380 align:middle line:90%
It's utopia.

00:36:33.380 --> 00:36:37.630 align:middle line:84%
It's these grand kinds
of social schemes.

00:36:37.630 --> 00:36:40.170 align:middle line:84%
It can be communism,
it can be socialism,

00:36:40.170 --> 00:36:44.700 align:middle line:84%
it can be the zeitgeist guys,
with their project Venus.

00:36:44.700 --> 00:36:50.340 align:middle line:84%
Whatever that sort of ideal
utopian experience is,

00:36:50.340 --> 00:36:51.770 align:middle line:90%
it's the 11th house.

00:36:51.770 --> 00:36:55.520 align:middle line:84%
Because theoretically-- think
about this-- theoretically,

00:36:55.520 --> 00:36:57.750 align:middle line:84%
this is how it's
supposed to work.

00:36:57.750 --> 00:37:00.170 align:middle line:84%
By this time we've
reached the 10th house,

00:37:00.170 --> 00:37:03.900 align:middle line:84%
we're supposed to be at the
apex of our civilization.

00:37:03.900 --> 00:37:08.630 align:middle line:84%
All of our ability to tap into
energy sources, whether it's

00:37:08.630 --> 00:37:12.010 align:middle line:84%
the planet's energy, or whether
it's things like free energy

00:37:12.010 --> 00:37:16.500 align:middle line:84%
or tapping the zero
point, at some point,

00:37:16.500 --> 00:37:19.200 align:middle line:84%
we have to make this
cultural transition,

00:37:19.200 --> 00:37:23.900 align:middle line:84%
so that we are moving
away from ascent

00:37:23.900 --> 00:37:27.830 align:middle line:84%
and moving more into
an omnidirectional and

00:37:27.830 --> 00:37:31.220 align:middle line:84%
omnidimensional experience
of life on this planet.

00:37:31.220 --> 00:37:35.130 align:middle line:84%
And part of the key
to this is technology.

00:37:35.130 --> 00:37:38.060 align:middle line:84%
And not technology
that would enslave us.

00:37:38.060 --> 00:37:40.221 align:middle line:84%
It's not surveillance
technology.

00:37:40.221 --> 00:37:41.720 align:middle line:84%
It's not the
technology that's going

00:37:41.720 --> 00:37:45.780 align:middle line:84%
to catch you on a
camera at a stoplight.

00:37:45.780 --> 00:37:47.910 align:middle line:84%
It's the technology
that's related

00:37:47.910 --> 00:37:49.820 align:middle line:90%
to things like free energy.

00:37:49.820 --> 00:37:52.670 align:middle line:84%
It's technology that
will have our cars get

00:37:52.670 --> 00:37:54.700 align:middle line:90%
100 miles to the gallon.

00:37:54.700 --> 00:37:56.280 align:middle line:84%
It's technology
that will allow us

00:37:56.280 --> 00:38:00.000 align:middle line:84%
to grow hydroponic
foods in our own homes.

00:38:00.000 --> 00:38:03.360 align:middle line:84%
I mean, these are the types of
technologies that can really

00:38:03.360 --> 00:38:08.440 align:middle line:84%
liberate us into the 11th
house and into this whole idea

00:38:08.440 --> 00:38:13.120 align:middle line:84%
that we're moving away from the
Capricornian moment of ascent

00:38:13.120 --> 00:38:15.590 align:middle line:84%
into a much more
omnidirectional,

00:38:15.590 --> 00:38:20.950 align:middle line:84%
omnidimensional space where
humanity has a shot-- where

00:38:20.950 --> 00:38:23.920 align:middle line:84%
the rich and the poor and
the black and the white,

00:38:23.920 --> 00:38:26.620 align:middle line:84%
we all co-mingle
in the 11th house.

00:38:26.620 --> 00:38:29.310 align:middle line:90%
And we're all relatively equal.

00:38:29.310 --> 00:38:34.150 align:middle line:84%
And the thing that levels the
playing field for all of us,

00:38:34.150 --> 00:38:36.860 align:middle line:84%
theoretically, should
be technology--

00:38:36.860 --> 00:38:39.600 align:middle line:84%
heart-based
technology that could

00:38:39.600 --> 00:38:42.190 align:middle line:84%
take living on this planet
to a whole other level.

00:38:42.190 --> 00:38:46.350 align:middle line:84%
But until we get that,
until we incorporate that,

00:38:46.350 --> 00:38:49.060 align:middle line:84%
and until our consciousness
is ready to accept that,

00:38:49.060 --> 00:38:50.830 align:middle line:84%
then the 11th house
will be incomplete.

00:38:50.830 --> 00:38:53.029 align:middle line:84%
We're at this-- or
experience of the 11th house

00:38:53.029 --> 00:38:53.820 align:middle line:90%
will be incomplete.

00:38:53.820 --> 00:38:55.510 align:middle line:84%
We're at this place
of transition here.

00:38:55.510 --> 00:38:57.759 align:middle line:84%
And I'm just talking about
the evolution of the chart,

00:38:57.759 --> 00:39:00.550 align:middle line:84%
the evolution of the individual,
society, culture in general,

00:39:00.550 --> 00:39:01.100 align:middle line:90%
right?

00:39:01.100 --> 00:39:03.940 align:middle line:84%
But in terms of the individual
itself in the 11th house,

00:39:03.940 --> 00:39:05.750 align:middle line:84%
if you have planets
there, you would

00:39:05.750 --> 00:39:07.250 align:middle line:90%
tend to be a very social person.

00:39:07.250 --> 00:39:09.050 align:middle line:90%
You would have a lot of friends.

00:39:09.050 --> 00:39:13.560 align:middle line:84%
You would have
Aquarian kinds of goals

00:39:13.560 --> 00:39:15.770 align:middle line:90%
and desires and interests.

00:39:15.770 --> 00:39:17.770 align:middle line:90%
So again, I'll use my chart.

00:39:17.770 --> 00:39:20.080 align:middle line:84%
I've got four planets
in the 11th house--

00:39:20.080 --> 00:39:23.150 align:middle line:84%
Mercury, Moon, and Venus,
so I'm very engaged

00:39:23.150 --> 00:39:25.820 align:middle line:84%
in this whole kind of
Aquarian, Uranian, 11th house

00:39:25.820 --> 00:39:27.330 align:middle line:90%
exploration in my own life.

00:39:27.330 --> 00:39:29.340 align:middle line:84%
But let's say you have
a planet up there,

00:39:29.340 --> 00:39:30.880 align:middle line:84%
and the planet
that you have there

00:39:30.880 --> 00:39:33.070 align:middle line:90%
would be-- how about Pluto?

00:39:33.070 --> 00:39:34.960 align:middle line:84%
Let's see a Pluto
in the 11th house.

00:39:34.960 --> 00:39:38.600 align:middle line:84%
You would have Pluto there,
and your goal, your desire,

00:39:38.600 --> 00:39:41.480 align:middle line:84%
your personal mission,
your astrological imprint

00:39:41.480 --> 00:39:44.120 align:middle line:84%
for that house would be
to transform society--

00:39:44.120 --> 00:39:48.400 align:middle line:84%
to transform culture, to
transform these Aquarian

00:39:48.400 --> 00:39:50.330 align:middle line:84%
systems that we're
talking about.

00:39:50.330 --> 00:39:53.005 align:middle line:84%
So you may be on the
frontlines of human rights.

00:39:53.005 --> 00:39:55.160 align:middle line:84%
Or you may be on the
frontlines of bringing

00:39:55.160 --> 00:39:57.820 align:middle line:84%
some of the technology I'm
talking about into the world,

00:39:57.820 --> 00:40:00.000 align:middle line:84%
because you can see
that it's important.

00:40:00.000 --> 00:40:01.740 align:middle line:90%
You can see that it matters.

00:40:01.740 --> 00:40:04.680 align:middle line:84%
You have a personal
mission in life,

00:40:04.680 --> 00:40:06.449 align:middle line:84%
and you feel very
strongly about it.

00:40:06.449 --> 00:40:07.740 align:middle line:90%
Because that's what Pluto does.

00:40:07.740 --> 00:40:10.560 align:middle line:84%
It evokes feelings of
intensity and mission

00:40:10.560 --> 00:40:12.160 align:middle line:90%
and purpose in our lives.

00:40:12.160 --> 00:40:13.710 align:middle line:90%
So that's the 11th house.

00:40:13.710 --> 00:40:17.720 align:middle line:84%
And as we move further away from
the 11th house, here we are.

00:40:17.720 --> 00:40:22.570 align:middle line:84%
We're in this kind of, ideally,
this great, wonderful sort

00:40:22.570 --> 00:40:26.120 align:middle line:84%
of paradise, and we're all
singing Kumbaya together.

00:40:26.120 --> 00:40:27.630 align:middle line:84%
We're all driving
around in flying

00:40:27.630 --> 00:40:29.950 align:middle line:84%
cars that are getting
200 miles per gallon.

00:40:29.950 --> 00:40:35.140 align:middle line:84%
And we can beam port to
Betelgeuse or Alpha Centauri,

00:40:35.140 --> 00:40:36.390 align:middle line:90%
wherever that is.

00:40:36.390 --> 00:40:38.310 align:middle line:90%
That's the 11th house wet dream.

00:40:38.310 --> 00:40:39.580 align:middle line:90%
Well, where we go from there?

00:40:39.580 --> 00:40:43.180 align:middle line:84%
We go into the 12th house,
and we go to Pisces.

00:40:43.180 --> 00:40:45.560 align:middle line:84%
And we started off here
with the individual,

00:40:45.560 --> 00:40:47.666 align:middle line:84%
and we've gone all
the way around.

00:40:47.666 --> 00:40:49.540 align:middle line:84%
And we've come to this
point where everything

00:40:49.540 --> 00:40:51.030 align:middle line:90%
dissolves and goes back to God.

00:40:51.030 --> 00:40:52.860 align:middle line:84%
It all goes and
returns to the Godhood.

00:40:52.860 --> 00:40:54.820 align:middle line:90%
The cosmic ocean, the void.

00:40:54.820 --> 00:40:59.810 align:middle line:84%
And humanity slips back out
into the space in which we came,

00:40:59.810 --> 00:41:02.230 align:middle line:84%
in which we were
pre-manifest, or un-manifest.

00:41:02.230 --> 00:41:03.904 align:middle line:90%
That's what the 11th house is.

00:41:03.904 --> 00:41:05.570 align:middle line:84%
And this is where the
individual leaves.

00:41:05.570 --> 00:41:06.820 align:middle line:90%
This is the house of the soul.

00:41:06.820 --> 00:41:07.990 align:middle line:90%
We come into the first.

00:41:07.990 --> 00:41:09.240 align:middle line:90%
And we leave through the 12th.

00:41:09.240 --> 00:41:11.750 align:middle line:84%
The dreamer, death,
rebirth, ideals.

00:41:11.750 --> 00:41:13.310 align:middle line:90%
That's all the 12th house.

00:41:13.310 --> 00:41:15.190 align:middle line:84%
And it's a very
mysterious house.

00:41:15.190 --> 00:41:18.110 align:middle line:84%
And people that have planets
in the 12th house natally,

00:41:18.110 --> 00:41:21.280 align:middle line:84%
they could have a very
difficult time in life,

00:41:21.280 --> 00:41:23.440 align:middle line:84%
especially if the sun
is there or Saturn

00:41:23.440 --> 00:41:27.270 align:middle line:84%
is there, to some extent
Neptune, certainly Mars.

00:41:27.270 --> 00:41:30.020 align:middle line:84%
These are planets where if
they're in the 12th house,

00:41:30.020 --> 00:41:32.220 align:middle line:84%
which is a house that's
hidden away from us,

00:41:32.220 --> 00:41:36.160 align:middle line:84%
symbolized by things like
mental institutions and prisons

00:41:36.160 --> 00:41:39.290 align:middle line:90%
and nunneries and monasteries.

00:41:39.290 --> 00:41:42.121 align:middle line:84%
Those are all 12th house
kinds of institutions.

00:41:42.121 --> 00:41:43.495 align:middle line:84%
When you get into
the 12th house,

00:41:43.495 --> 00:41:45.450 align:middle line:84%
it's all tucked
away from the world.

00:41:45.450 --> 00:41:46.380 align:middle line:90%
You can't see it.

00:41:46.380 --> 00:41:48.380 align:middle line:84%
And it's even tucked
away from the individual.

00:41:48.380 --> 00:41:50.440 align:middle line:84%
That's how deep
the 12th house is.

00:41:50.440 --> 00:41:52.790 align:middle line:84%
With the 12th house, if
you have planets there,

00:41:52.790 --> 00:41:55.270 align:middle line:84%
the soul always
has the first move.

00:41:55.270 --> 00:41:58.040 align:middle line:84%
You're always, always
waiting for this kind

00:41:58.040 --> 00:42:00.480 align:middle line:84%
of emergent energy
to come through,

00:42:00.480 --> 00:42:03.250 align:middle line:84%
through the depths of
who you are, and come up

00:42:03.250 --> 00:42:04.100 align:middle line:90%
into your life.

00:42:04.100 --> 00:42:06.550 align:middle line:84%
Now one of the
fascinating things--

00:42:06.550 --> 00:42:08.530 align:middle line:84%
we'll get into this
on a later show--

00:42:08.530 --> 00:42:13.090 align:middle line:84%
is that you can get the energy
and the aspect of the planet

00:42:13.090 --> 00:42:17.305 align:middle line:84%
in the 12th house out via one
of the aspects of planets that

00:42:17.305 --> 00:42:20.310 align:middle line:84%
are connected to that
planet in the 12th house.

00:42:20.310 --> 00:42:26.020 align:middle line:84%
So let's say, for instance, you
have Mercury in the 12th house.

00:42:26.020 --> 00:42:30.250 align:middle line:84%
So that would mean that you
are really dreamy, that you're

00:42:30.250 --> 00:42:34.540 align:middle line:84%
much more engaged in nonverbal
types of communication.

00:42:34.540 --> 00:42:36.060 align:middle line:90%
You might be very poetic.

00:42:36.060 --> 00:42:38.310 align:middle line:90%
You might be very psychic.

00:42:38.310 --> 00:42:41.969 align:middle line:84%
You might have, at times,
even a learning disability

00:42:41.969 --> 00:42:43.010 align:middle line:90%
with Mercury in the 12th.

00:42:43.010 --> 00:42:45.410 align:middle line:84%
Doesn't mean that
you're unintelligent,

00:42:45.410 --> 00:42:48.430 align:middle line:84%
but it could be difficult
for that energy of Mercury,

00:42:48.430 --> 00:42:50.820 align:middle line:84%
the planet of communication,
to come out of the 12th.

00:42:50.820 --> 00:42:52.410 align:middle line:84%
Well, let's just
say, for instance,

00:42:52.410 --> 00:42:55.270 align:middle line:84%
you have another planet up
here in the ninth house.

00:42:55.270 --> 00:42:57.910 align:middle line:84%
Let's say you have the
sun in the ninth house.

00:42:57.910 --> 00:42:59.214 align:middle line:90%
Or how about Mars?

00:42:59.214 --> 00:43:00.380 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, let's go with the sun.

00:43:00.380 --> 00:43:02.140 align:middle line:84%
Sun in the ninth house,
although they probably

00:43:02.140 --> 00:43:03.264 align:middle line:90%
wouldn't be that far apart.

00:43:03.264 --> 00:43:05.865 align:middle line:84%
Let's make the sun right here
at the edge of the ninth house.

00:43:05.865 --> 00:43:06.740 align:middle line:90%
And you have a trine.

00:43:06.740 --> 00:43:09.560 align:middle line:84%
Let's say you have a trine--
that should be a sextile.

00:43:09.560 --> 00:43:11.185 align:middle line:84%
Let's go with the
sextile, or something

00:43:11.185 --> 00:43:13.360 align:middle line:84%
like that with a Mercury
sun to the ninth house.

00:43:13.360 --> 00:43:16.470 align:middle line:84%
Then you could have
this energy that

00:43:16.470 --> 00:43:20.600 align:middle line:84%
would be manifest and coming
through, and manifesting

00:43:20.600 --> 00:43:24.000 align:middle line:84%
in the personality with the
sun near the mid-heaven.

00:43:24.000 --> 00:43:28.920 align:middle line:84%
And then the individual
and the personality

00:43:28.920 --> 00:43:32.090 align:middle line:84%
can have an opportunity
to bring that energy,

00:43:32.090 --> 00:43:36.010 align:middle line:84%
to bring that information, to
bring that flow from the 12th

00:43:36.010 --> 00:43:41.190 align:middle line:84%
up here and give it some kind of
form, some kind of expression.

00:43:41.190 --> 00:43:44.140 align:middle line:84%
And sometimes it doesn't
have to be a sextile.

00:43:44.140 --> 00:43:46.270 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes it could be
a trine, or a square,

00:43:46.270 --> 00:43:49.450 align:middle line:84%
or even an opposition
to some extent.

00:43:49.450 --> 00:43:53.630 align:middle line:84%
But the key is to have some kind
of contact with another planet,

00:43:53.630 --> 00:43:55.810 align:middle line:84%
with that planet
in the 12th house.

00:43:55.810 --> 00:43:58.590 align:middle line:84%
But ultimately,
if the individual

00:43:58.590 --> 00:44:01.260 align:middle line:84%
has planets there
natally, then they

00:44:01.260 --> 00:44:05.830 align:middle line:84%
are here to understand
how the soul operates,

00:44:05.830 --> 00:44:09.680 align:middle line:84%
and how the soul operates in
conjunction with having a body.

00:44:09.680 --> 00:44:11.450 align:middle line:84%
They have to take time
out of their lives,

00:44:11.450 --> 00:44:14.810 align:middle line:84%
at times, to really connect
with themselves at a deep level.

00:44:14.810 --> 00:44:18.090 align:middle line:84%
So retreats, or some
form of meditation

00:44:18.090 --> 00:44:19.750 align:middle line:84%
is generally
advisable for people

00:44:19.750 --> 00:44:24.290 align:middle line:84%
that have a planet or a series
of planets in the 12th house.

00:44:24.290 --> 00:44:26.140 align:middle line:84%
Well, we started off
as the individual

00:44:26.140 --> 00:44:28.230 align:middle line:84%
coming into the
chart through Aries.

00:44:28.230 --> 00:44:29.770 align:middle line:84%
We fell in love in
the fifth house.

00:44:29.770 --> 00:44:31.990 align:middle line:84%
We found our purpose
in the sixth.

00:44:31.990 --> 00:44:34.220 align:middle line:84%
We met somebody, we got
married in the seventh.

00:44:34.220 --> 00:44:36.620 align:middle line:84%
We had sex and
children in the eighth.

00:44:36.620 --> 00:44:42.180 align:middle line:84%
We figured out the spiritual,
realization, connotation,

00:44:42.180 --> 00:44:44.375 align:middle line:84%
and understanding,
and the philosophical

00:44:44.375 --> 00:44:48.230 align:middle line:84%
and the moral ramifications
of all of it in the ninth.

00:44:48.230 --> 00:44:51.280 align:middle line:84%
We created the world
and society in the 10th.

00:44:51.280 --> 00:44:53.780 align:middle line:84%
And then in the 11th,
we decided that we

00:44:53.780 --> 00:44:56.540 align:middle line:84%
needed to cast off a lot
of our social structures

00:44:56.540 --> 00:44:57.570 align:middle line:90%
and constraints.

00:44:57.570 --> 00:44:59.560 align:middle line:84%
We stepped off into
space from the pyramid

00:44:59.560 --> 00:45:01.969 align:middle line:90%
of Capricorn and civilization.

00:45:01.969 --> 00:45:03.510 align:middle line:84%
We're driving around
in our jet cars,

00:45:03.510 --> 00:45:06.140 align:middle line:84%
and we're beaming to Alpha
Centauri and Betelgeuse.

00:45:06.140 --> 00:45:07.950 align:middle line:84%
And now we're into
the 12th house.

00:45:07.950 --> 00:45:09.200 align:middle line:90%
We're dissolving back to God.

00:45:09.200 --> 00:45:12.607 align:middle line:84%
We're moving back out
of form and into spirit

00:45:12.607 --> 00:45:14.940 align:middle line:84%
where we can do this all over
again on some other planet

00:45:14.940 --> 00:45:17.012 align:middle line:84%
in some other place
and some other time.

00:45:17.012 --> 00:45:18.220 align:middle line:90%
So that's it, boys and girls.

00:45:18.220 --> 00:45:21.880 align:middle line:84%
That is the mechanics
of the wheel

00:45:21.880 --> 00:45:23.280 align:middle line:90%
in a short amount of time.

00:45:23.280 --> 00:45:25.610 align:middle line:84%
So thank you very
much for joining me,

00:45:25.610 --> 00:45:28.460 align:middle line:84%
and join me again next time
on "The Eleventh House," where

00:45:28.460 --> 00:45:32.339 align:middle line:84%
we explore more mechanics of
astrology and help bring you

00:45:32.339 --> 00:45:34.380 align:middle line:84%
more understanding about
this wonderful art form.

00:45:34.380 --> 00:45:37.822 align:middle line:84%
That's me, Robert Phoenix,
"The Eleventh House."

00:45:37.822 --> 00:45:48.934 align:middle line:90%
