00:00:16.714 --> 00:00:17.880 align:middle line:90%
>>ROBERT PHOENIX: Hi, there.

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:20.220 align:middle line:10%
This is Robert Phoenix, and
welcome to another edition

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:21.460 align:middle line:10%
of "The Eleventh House."

00:00:21.460 --> 00:00:25.790 align:middle line:10%
It's always good to be back here
talking astrology and looking

00:00:25.790 --> 00:00:29.650 align:middle line:10%
at how the stars are
a navigational tool

00:00:29.650 --> 00:00:30.390 align:middle line:10%
for our lives.

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:31.490 align:middle line:84%
And that's pretty
much what they are.

00:00:31.490 --> 00:00:33.156 align:middle line:84%
They're a navigational
tool, and they're

00:00:33.156 --> 00:00:35.120 align:middle line:84%
a very succinct
navigational tool.

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:37.790 align:middle line:84%
Later on in the show, I'll
share some personal examples

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:43.109 align:middle line:84%
of my life recently that will
confer this data in real time.

00:00:43.109 --> 00:00:45.400 align:middle line:84%
Today's show is going to be
just a little bit different

00:00:45.400 --> 00:00:48.316 align:middle line:84%
than some of the other shows
that you've seen here on Gaiam.

00:00:48.316 --> 00:00:49.940 align:middle line:84%
What we're going to
be looking at today

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:53.440 align:middle line:84%
is sort of a survival
guide through astrology

00:00:53.440 --> 00:00:57.170 align:middle line:84%
and through the times that
we're in or based on the times

00:00:57.170 --> 00:01:00.670 align:middle line:84%
that we're in, which are quite
challenging in many ways.

00:01:00.670 --> 00:01:04.870 align:middle line:84%
But first of all, I think it's
important to set the table, so

00:01:04.870 --> 00:01:08.090 align:middle line:84%
to speak, and to kind of
understand what we are

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:12.440 align:middle line:84%
and how astrology plays a
role in our lives and impacts

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:14.400 align:middle line:84%
how we can move through
it successfully.

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:19.350 align:middle line:84%
First of all, we, me, you,
we're multi-dimensional beings.

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:23.590 align:middle line:84%
We exist in many different
levels of space and time.

00:01:23.590 --> 00:01:26.810 align:middle line:84%
It's been proven that there
are 12 dimensions of reality.

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:29.330 align:middle line:84%
There are 12 chakras
that also relate

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:31.490 align:middle line:84%
to these 12
dimensions of reality.

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:36.300 align:middle line:84%
And there are 12 houses within
the zodiac in the wheel.

00:01:36.300 --> 00:01:38.770 align:middle line:84%
So we are constantly
interacting, even though we're

00:01:38.770 --> 00:01:41.670 align:middle line:84%
not aware of it, with this
multi-dimensional phase

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:42.520 align:middle line:90%
of our existence.

00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:44.320 align:middle line:84%
But we're also physical
beings as well.

00:01:44.320 --> 00:01:46.300 align:middle line:84%
We're here on Earth,
and we're dealing

00:01:46.300 --> 00:01:48.780 align:middle line:84%
with the
three-dimensional gravity

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:51.110 align:middle line:84%
of living in the
21st century in very

00:01:51.110 --> 00:01:53.480 align:middle line:84%
challenging and
unsettling times.

00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:56.700 align:middle line:84%
I just got an email not
long ago to my website

00:01:56.700 --> 00:01:58.230 align:middle line:84%
from a couple that
lives in Greece.

00:01:58.230 --> 00:02:00.850 align:middle line:90%
Their name is Plutonia and Leon.

00:02:00.850 --> 00:02:04.290 align:middle line:84%
And they have gone through
the Greek banking crisis,

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:06.100 align:middle line:84%
and they have been
completely wiped out.

00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:08.440 align:middle line:84%
They have very little,
and yet they're

00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:10.539 align:middle line:84%
finding something
inside of themselves

00:02:10.539 --> 00:02:13.690 align:middle line:84%
and some part of their
human experience, which

00:02:13.690 --> 00:02:15.710 align:middle line:84%
is keeping them going,
which is driving them

00:02:15.710 --> 00:02:17.850 align:middle line:84%
further and further
and deeper and deeper

00:02:17.850 --> 00:02:21.110 align:middle line:84%
into their own personal
and transcendental truth.

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:23.190 align:middle line:84%
And I think, in
some ways, we're all

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:25.170 align:middle line:84%
in the same place
with varying degrees.

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:27.750 align:middle line:84%
And what's challenging about
the world that we live in

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:29.420 align:middle line:84%
is that we look
around, and we see

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:32.790 align:middle line:84%
a lot of markers that remind
us of how things have been.

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:35.000 align:middle line:84%
There are houses that
we are familiar with,

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:36.980 align:middle line:84%
maybe even houses
that we grew up in.

00:02:36.980 --> 00:02:40.040 align:middle line:84%
Towns, small towns
haven't changed very much

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:43.230 align:middle line:84%
over the course of, say,
maybe the last 25 or 30 years.

00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:47.310 align:middle line:84%
Cars, we can still see cars
from the '80s and the '90s.

00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:51.370 align:middle line:84%
And there are even TV shows that
still reflect and reverberate

00:02:51.370 --> 00:02:52.360 align:middle line:90%
back from those times.

00:02:52.360 --> 00:02:56.970 align:middle line:84%
So we're living, in some ways,
with a simulacra of memory,

00:02:56.970 --> 00:02:59.935 align:middle line:84%
of our experience, our
history, and yet there

00:02:59.935 --> 00:03:01.270 align:middle line:90%
is something else taking place.

00:03:01.270 --> 00:03:03.590 align:middle line:84%
There's a whole new
world that's emerging,

00:03:03.590 --> 00:03:07.020 align:middle line:84%
and it's emerging in ways that
are fairly unsettling, chaotic,

00:03:07.020 --> 00:03:10.152 align:middle line:84%
and confusing for some
people, hopeful for others.

00:03:10.152 --> 00:03:11.860 align:middle line:84%
So what we're going
to do in today's show

00:03:11.860 --> 00:03:15.070 align:middle line:84%
is we're going to look at
how we can use astrology,

00:03:15.070 --> 00:03:18.430 align:middle line:84%
and especially some
of the current trends,

00:03:18.430 --> 00:03:21.160 align:middle line:84%
and how we can use these
trends and these cycles

00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:23.030 align:middle line:84%
and some of these
aspects to actually get

00:03:23.030 --> 00:03:24.660 align:middle line:90%
through these times.

00:03:24.660 --> 00:03:28.190 align:middle line:84%
And we're going to do that by
looking at Saturn, obviously

00:03:28.190 --> 00:03:33.220 align:middle line:84%
a big player, and the outer
planets, Uranus, Neptune,

00:03:33.220 --> 00:03:37.560 align:middle line:84%
Pluto, and Chiron as well,
as well as the North Node.

00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:39.350 align:middle line:90%
So let's get into this.

00:03:39.350 --> 00:03:40.890 align:middle line:90%
This is the astrology of you.

00:03:40.890 --> 00:03:41.660 align:middle line:90%
This is about you.

00:03:41.660 --> 00:03:42.450 align:middle line:90%
This is for you.

00:03:42.450 --> 00:03:45.300 align:middle line:84%
And to understand kind
of where we're going,

00:03:45.300 --> 00:03:47.169 align:middle line:84%
we need to understand
where we are.

00:03:47.169 --> 00:03:48.710 align:middle line:84%
So here we are, the
astrology of you.

00:03:48.710 --> 00:03:49.600 align:middle line:90%
You're in there somewhere.

00:03:49.600 --> 00:03:50.891 align:middle line:90%
Step through the looking glass.

00:03:50.891 --> 00:03:52.110 align:middle line:90%
It's a portal.

00:03:52.110 --> 00:03:54.260 align:middle line:90%
It's a mirror to your soul.

00:03:54.260 --> 00:03:56.750 align:middle line:84%
And that's where you
are, theoretically,

00:03:56.750 --> 00:03:58.494 align:middle line:90%
if you're watching this show.

00:03:58.494 --> 00:03:59.410 align:middle line:90%
You're on this planet.

00:03:59.410 --> 00:04:02.140 align:middle line:84%
You're somewhere
within the space

00:04:02.140 --> 00:04:04.350 align:middle line:84%
of this beautiful,
blue-green orb.

00:04:04.350 --> 00:04:08.317 align:middle line:84%
And you can see that there's
some unusual cloud formations

00:04:08.317 --> 00:04:09.900 align:middle line:84%
that we are now
becoming more used to.

00:04:09.900 --> 00:04:12.260 align:middle line:84%
We'll see those more up close
as the show goes on here.

00:04:12.260 --> 00:04:16.870 align:middle line:84%
This is a scene that
many people are not

00:04:16.870 --> 00:04:19.798 align:middle line:90%
all that unfamiliar with.

00:04:19.798 --> 00:04:24.250 align:middle line:84%
This is a slice of life in
America in the 21st century.

00:04:24.250 --> 00:04:25.770 align:middle line:90%
This is homelessness.

00:04:25.770 --> 00:04:28.320 align:middle line:84%
And the amount of
homelessness, or people

00:04:28.320 --> 00:04:30.880 align:middle line:84%
that are on the borderline
of being homeless,

00:04:30.880 --> 00:04:34.250 align:middle line:84%
is far greater than almost
any other time in our history.

00:04:34.250 --> 00:04:37.110 align:middle line:84%
There are people that have
had to leave their homes,

00:04:37.110 --> 00:04:40.290 align:middle line:84%
and they settle in
cheap hotels for a week

00:04:40.290 --> 00:04:43.350 align:middle line:84%
or a month at a time,
oftentimes with children, just

00:04:43.350 --> 00:04:44.470 align:middle line:90%
in order to get by.

00:04:44.470 --> 00:04:47.471 align:middle line:84%
And this is an extreme example
of some of the challenges

00:04:47.471 --> 00:04:48.470 align:middle line:90%
that we're dealing with.

00:04:48.470 --> 00:04:51.545 align:middle line:84%
Homelessness isn't just
being without a home.

00:04:51.545 --> 00:04:53.240 align:middle line:90%
There's a consciousness.

00:04:53.240 --> 00:04:55.480 align:middle line:84%
There's a mental
and emotional state

00:04:55.480 --> 00:04:58.390 align:middle line:84%
that goes along with
the reality of the lives

00:04:58.390 --> 00:05:01.470 align:middle line:84%
that these men and others
like them are experiencing.

00:05:01.470 --> 00:05:07.370 align:middle line:84%
So this is just one piece of
an emerging and, in some ways,

00:05:07.370 --> 00:05:12.910 align:middle line:84%
a growing trend in our
life and in our world.

00:05:12.910 --> 00:05:14.210 align:middle line:90%
Poverty.

00:05:14.210 --> 00:05:17.760 align:middle line:84%
The amount of poverty that
is taking place on the planet

00:05:17.760 --> 00:05:22.240 align:middle line:84%
is getting larger and larger
with each passing day.

00:05:22.240 --> 00:05:26.330 align:middle line:84%
We're seeing this widening
gap between the haves

00:05:26.330 --> 00:05:27.090 align:middle line:90%
and the have-nots.

00:05:27.090 --> 00:05:29.030 align:middle line:84%
And even the middle
class, which has

00:05:29.030 --> 00:05:33.720 align:middle line:84%
been the ballast and
the sort of the baseline

00:05:33.720 --> 00:05:36.780 align:middle line:84%
for personal wealth in
this country and the world,

00:05:36.780 --> 00:05:39.340 align:middle line:84%
even the middle class
is shrinking and going

00:05:39.340 --> 00:05:43.770 align:middle line:84%
away as the jobs and as
more and more costs are

00:05:43.770 --> 00:05:45.410 align:middle line:90%
put upon the consumer.

00:05:45.410 --> 00:05:48.650 align:middle line:84%
The cost of living,
inflation, the cost of fuel,

00:05:48.650 --> 00:05:51.940 align:middle line:84%
all these things are driving
up the prices and the prices

00:05:51.940 --> 00:05:55.140 align:middle line:84%
by which we derive our
daily bread from and with.

00:05:55.140 --> 00:06:00.630 align:middle line:84%
So what we're dealing with here
is this emerging issue, again,

00:06:00.630 --> 00:06:05.430 align:middle line:84%
of poverty, and it's becoming
more visceral for many of us.

00:06:05.430 --> 00:06:07.620 align:middle line:84%
The Occupy movement
was many things,

00:06:07.620 --> 00:06:09.630 align:middle line:84%
but one of the
things that it did do

00:06:09.630 --> 00:06:14.440 align:middle line:84%
is that it did show us,
for a brief moment in time,

00:06:14.440 --> 00:06:16.657 align:middle line:84%
that there is a great
disparity between the haves

00:06:16.657 --> 00:06:17.240 align:middle line:90%
and have-nots.

00:06:17.240 --> 00:06:19.560 align:middle line:84%
And it's not even
the 1% and the 99%.

00:06:19.560 --> 00:06:23.600 align:middle line:84%
it's more like the 0.25%
and the rest of us.

00:06:23.600 --> 00:06:28.210 align:middle line:84%
So poverty is not just an
issue we're dealing with now.

00:06:28.210 --> 00:06:31.230 align:middle line:84%
It's going to become a greater
issue as the days, weeks,

00:06:31.230 --> 00:06:34.750 align:middle line:90%
months, and years move on.

00:06:34.750 --> 00:06:35.550 align:middle line:90%
The environment.

00:06:35.550 --> 00:06:36.780 align:middle line:90%
These are chemtrails.

00:06:36.780 --> 00:06:38.924 align:middle line:84%
We're dealing with
them constantly.

00:06:38.924 --> 00:06:40.090 align:middle line:90%
You may think that I'm nuts.

00:06:40.090 --> 00:06:42.256 align:middle line:84%
You may think that people
that believe in chemtrails

00:06:42.256 --> 00:06:45.010 align:middle line:84%
are crazy, that they're
nothing but contrails.

00:06:45.010 --> 00:06:49.170 align:middle line:84%
I grew up in the
1960s and the 1970s,

00:06:49.170 --> 00:06:50.800 align:middle line:84%
and I know what a
contrail looks like.

00:06:50.800 --> 00:06:52.970 align:middle line:84%
A contrail takes
place over 30,000 feet

00:06:52.970 --> 00:06:56.110 align:middle line:84%
above the atmosphere,
and then it dissipates.

00:06:56.110 --> 00:06:58.050 align:middle line:90%
These are not contrails.

00:06:58.050 --> 00:07:03.340 align:middle line:84%
This is a pattern of chemtrail
dispersal, geoengineering,

00:07:03.340 --> 00:07:05.640 align:middle line:84%
aerosol spraying, and
it will spread out.

00:07:05.640 --> 00:07:07.110 align:middle line:90%
It'll become cloud cover.

00:07:07.110 --> 00:07:09.800 align:middle line:84%
And number one, it
will dim the sun.

00:07:09.800 --> 00:07:12.895 align:middle line:84%
And number two, it will
create some type of condition,

00:07:12.895 --> 00:07:16.240 align:middle line:84%
can either be rain, perhaps
snow, the polar vortex.

00:07:16.240 --> 00:07:18.290 align:middle line:84%
Whatever that is,
this is an issue.

00:07:18.290 --> 00:07:19.580 align:middle line:90%
This is a challenge.

00:07:19.580 --> 00:07:20.810 align:middle line:90%
We're dealing with it.

00:07:20.810 --> 00:07:23.750 align:middle line:84%
Inside of these
chemtrails, we have

00:07:23.750 --> 00:07:29.920 align:middle line:84%
things like aluminum, barium,
cesium, yes, cesium, manganese,

00:07:29.920 --> 00:07:32.660 align:middle line:84%
all these heavy
metals, iron oxide.

00:07:32.660 --> 00:07:34.082 align:middle line:90%
They're in our system.

00:07:34.082 --> 00:07:35.790 align:middle line:84%
We're breathing them
in on a daily basis.

00:07:35.790 --> 00:07:39.120 align:middle line:84%
This is another challenge
that we have to deal with.

00:07:39.120 --> 00:07:40.727 align:middle line:90%
Everybody has to deal with this.

00:07:40.727 --> 00:07:42.560 align:middle line:84%
Well, except for the
people that created it,

00:07:42.560 --> 00:07:46.110 align:middle line:84%
because they've got their
own little solution to that.

00:07:46.110 --> 00:07:46.840 align:middle line:90%
War.

00:07:46.840 --> 00:07:47.805 align:middle line:90%
War.

00:07:47.805 --> 00:07:49.630 align:middle line:84%
We are on the brink
of war it seems

00:07:49.630 --> 00:07:52.430 align:middle line:84%
like almost every day
now, whether it's us,

00:07:52.430 --> 00:07:55.340 align:middle line:84%
or whether it's another
country, whether it's

00:07:55.340 --> 00:08:01.210 align:middle line:84%
Libya, or Syria, or
the Sudan, or Ukraine.

00:08:01.210 --> 00:08:05.510 align:middle line:84%
The specter of war, revolution,
regime change, it's constant.

00:08:05.510 --> 00:08:08.600 align:middle line:84%
We live in a time
of war without end.

00:08:08.600 --> 00:08:10.680 align:middle line:84%
It may not be the
great world war,

00:08:10.680 --> 00:08:13.710 align:middle line:84%
but there is enough global
conflict taking place

00:08:13.710 --> 00:08:18.440 align:middle line:84%
across the planet, which
disturbs our sense of being.

00:08:18.440 --> 00:08:21.670 align:middle line:84%
And it disturbs
our ability to feel

00:08:21.670 --> 00:08:23.140 align:middle line:84%
like we're living
in a world that

00:08:23.140 --> 00:08:26.280 align:middle line:84%
has some kind of coherence,
that we could have kind

00:08:26.280 --> 00:08:29.350 align:middle line:84%
of a linear experience
with our lives.

00:08:29.350 --> 00:08:32.460 align:middle line:84%
This is always just
in the background

00:08:32.460 --> 00:08:33.650 align:middle line:90%
of our consciousness.

00:08:33.650 --> 00:08:35.690 align:middle line:84%
And with Ukraine, it's
really in the foreground

00:08:35.690 --> 00:08:37.980 align:middle line:90%
of our consciousness.

00:08:37.980 --> 00:08:39.572 align:middle line:90%
Genetically-modified foods.

00:08:39.572 --> 00:08:41.280 align:middle line:84%
This is another issue
we're dealing with.

00:08:41.280 --> 00:08:43.529 align:middle line:84%
And there are people that
are doing good work fighting

00:08:43.529 --> 00:08:46.440 align:middle line:84%
genetically-modified foods,
but it's a challenge.

00:08:46.440 --> 00:08:48.940 align:middle line:84%
And it's a challenge
because both the government

00:08:48.940 --> 00:08:50.759 align:middle line:84%
and the corporations,
which are in charge

00:08:50.759 --> 00:08:52.800 align:middle line:84%
of genetically-modified
foods, not just Monsanto,

00:08:52.800 --> 00:08:56.920 align:middle line:84%
there are others, they have
been colluding and creating

00:08:56.920 --> 00:09:00.140 align:middle line:84%
legislation to
protect themselves.

00:09:00.140 --> 00:09:01.940 align:middle line:84%
And even when a
state like California

00:09:01.940 --> 00:09:06.010 align:middle line:84%
decides that it is going to put
something on the ballot that

00:09:06.010 --> 00:09:09.110 align:middle line:84%
is going to cause
companies to label

00:09:09.110 --> 00:09:10.866 align:middle line:84%
their foods as
genetically-modified,

00:09:10.866 --> 00:09:12.490 align:middle line:84%
huge amounts of money
are thrown at it,

00:09:12.490 --> 00:09:14.304 align:middle line:90%
and it's eventually defeated.

00:09:14.304 --> 00:09:16.220 align:middle line:84%
This is another issue
that we're dealing with.

00:09:16.220 --> 00:09:18.390 align:middle line:84%
So they're starting
to stack up now.

00:09:18.390 --> 00:09:20.010 align:middle line:84%
And if you have any
kind of awareness,

00:09:20.010 --> 00:09:22.770 align:middle line:84%
any kind of consciousness,
you know this stuff, right?

00:09:22.770 --> 00:09:24.800 align:middle line:90%
You cannot dismiss it.

00:09:24.800 --> 00:09:25.860 align:middle line:90%
You just can't.

00:09:25.860 --> 00:09:28.060 align:middle line:84%
And even if you're
doing well in your life,

00:09:28.060 --> 00:09:29.730 align:middle line:84%
you can't really
dismiss it, because you

00:09:29.730 --> 00:09:33.010 align:middle line:84%
know that somebody
somewhere else is

00:09:33.010 --> 00:09:34.355 align:middle line:90%
going through a difficult time.

00:09:34.355 --> 00:09:37.290 align:middle line:84%
And it makes it
challenging for us

00:09:37.290 --> 00:09:40.940 align:middle line:84%
to kind of stay in the
warm and fuzzy cocoon

00:09:40.940 --> 00:09:42.650 align:middle line:90%
that we used to live in.

00:09:42.650 --> 00:09:46.305 align:middle line:84%
That membrane, that
veil between us

00:09:46.305 --> 00:09:48.430 align:middle line:84%
and them is getting thinner
and thinner and thinner

00:09:48.430 --> 00:09:50.240 align:middle line:90%
with every passing day.

00:09:50.240 --> 00:09:52.130 align:middle line:90%
The banks.

00:09:52.130 --> 00:09:55.840 align:middle line:84%
J.P. Morgan here is kind
of a symbol of the banks,

00:09:55.840 --> 00:09:58.734 align:middle line:84%
has been engaged in
a banking scandal.

00:09:58.734 --> 00:10:00.400 align:middle line:84%
I'm sure some of you
have been following

00:10:00.400 --> 00:10:03.390 align:middle line:84%
this, the strange
tale of dead bankers.

00:10:03.390 --> 00:10:05.070 align:middle line:84%
I think they're up
to nine now that

00:10:05.070 --> 00:10:07.570 align:middle line:90%
are associated with J.P. Morgan.

00:10:07.570 --> 00:10:11.490 align:middle line:84%
In 2009, the end of
2008, October, 2008,

00:10:11.490 --> 00:10:14.470 align:middle line:84%
beginning of 2009, much
of our fears with banking

00:10:14.470 --> 00:10:16.280 align:middle line:84%
were confirmed when
the United States went

00:10:16.280 --> 00:10:20.060 align:middle line:84%
through a major banking
crisis all based

00:10:20.060 --> 00:10:25.230 align:middle line:84%
on toxic debt, all based on
derivatives that were accrued

00:10:25.230 --> 00:10:31.330 align:middle line:84%
during the housing blitz,
the housing crush and rush

00:10:31.330 --> 00:10:32.899 align:middle line:90%
during the late '90s.

00:10:32.899 --> 00:10:34.690 align:middle line:84%
Those toxic debts,
they're still out there.

00:10:34.690 --> 00:10:35.856 align:middle line:90%
They've been sold to Europe.

00:10:35.856 --> 00:10:37.320 align:middle line:84%
And when they were
sold to Europe,

00:10:37.320 --> 00:10:38.660 align:middle line:84%
what did we see what
happened in Europe?

00:10:38.660 --> 00:10:40.160 align:middle line:90%
We saw the Greek banking crisis.

00:10:40.160 --> 00:10:42.195 align:middle line:84%
We saw the banking
crisis in Spain.

00:10:42.195 --> 00:10:45.240 align:middle line:84%
We saw the banking crisis in
Cyprus, the banking crisis

00:10:45.240 --> 00:10:50.040 align:middle line:84%
in Italy, and of course, the
infusion of money from the IMF

00:10:50.040 --> 00:10:55.310 align:middle line:84%
and the hardship that
people had to take on

00:10:55.310 --> 00:11:00.520 align:middle line:84%
as a result of this money being
infused into their economy.

00:11:00.520 --> 00:11:02.820 align:middle line:84%
They had to settle
for a lot less.

00:11:02.820 --> 00:11:04.820 align:middle line:84%
And in fact, in
Greece, many people

00:11:04.820 --> 00:11:06.855 align:middle line:84%
lost their pensions
as a result of this.

00:11:06.855 --> 00:11:10.050 align:middle line:84%
So again, here's another
symptom of our times.

00:11:10.050 --> 00:11:12.720 align:middle line:84%
It's the banking, the
banking situation.

00:11:12.720 --> 00:11:14.880 align:middle line:90%
You know, we talk about a reset.

00:11:14.880 --> 00:11:18.810 align:middle line:84%
We talk about it like
somebody's about to get

00:11:18.810 --> 00:11:20.340 align:middle line:90%
traded from one team to another.

00:11:20.340 --> 00:11:24.390 align:middle line:84%
It's almost become a
casual form of repartee

00:11:24.390 --> 00:11:26.491 align:middle line:84%
in the lives of many
people, people that I know.

00:11:26.491 --> 00:11:27.782 align:middle line:90%
And so we're thinking about it.

00:11:27.782 --> 00:11:31.300 align:middle line:84%
It's another thing that our
consciousness is dealing with.

00:11:31.300 --> 00:11:32.830 align:middle line:90%
They're all kind of out there.

00:11:32.830 --> 00:11:33.980 align:middle line:90%
They're orbiting around us.

00:11:33.980 --> 00:11:35.470 align:middle line:90%
They're stacking up.

00:11:35.470 --> 00:11:40.720 align:middle line:84%
And what happens is it creates
a level of pressure and stress

00:11:40.720 --> 00:11:45.520 align:middle line:84%
that I think is--
it's at a level that

00:11:45.520 --> 00:11:47.280 align:middle line:90%
hasn't been approached before.

00:11:47.280 --> 00:11:49.175 align:middle line:84%
It's almost unparalleled
in our time.

00:11:49.175 --> 00:11:51.300 align:middle line:84%
Now, maybe it happened
during the Great Depression,

00:11:51.300 --> 00:11:53.230 align:middle line:84%
maybe it happened
during World War II.

00:11:53.230 --> 00:11:55.710 align:middle line:84%
But a lot of us haven't
lived through those times.

00:11:55.710 --> 00:11:59.380 align:middle line:84%
And now we're seeing
the accumulation

00:11:59.380 --> 00:12:01.150 align:middle line:84%
of all these pressure
points in our lives.

00:12:01.150 --> 00:12:03.810 align:middle line:84%
So the banking crisis,
yet another one.

00:12:03.810 --> 00:12:06.960 align:middle line:84%
And we have the rise
of the new money,

00:12:06.960 --> 00:12:09.190 align:middle line:90%
the rise of the new wealth.

00:12:09.190 --> 00:12:11.720 align:middle line:84%
And this, again, comes
into the disparity

00:12:11.720 --> 00:12:15.920 align:middle line:84%
between the haves
and the have-nots.

00:12:15.920 --> 00:12:21.200 align:middle line:84%
And it creates a real sense
in some people's lives

00:12:21.200 --> 00:12:23.220 align:middle line:84%
that they will
never have enough.

00:12:23.220 --> 00:12:26.320 align:middle line:84%
And that, by the
way, is an illusion.

00:12:26.320 --> 00:12:28.920 align:middle line:84%
But it's an illusion
that's being perpetrated

00:12:28.920 --> 00:12:30.730 align:middle line:84%
by the people that
want to control

00:12:30.730 --> 00:12:36.230 align:middle line:84%
the economic and financial
matrix that you're living in.

00:12:36.230 --> 00:12:40.680 align:middle line:84%
And then we get these people,
who are here almost 24/7

00:12:40.680 --> 00:12:43.540 align:middle line:84%
in our consciousness,
major distraction.

00:12:43.540 --> 00:12:45.250 align:middle line:90%
And this is just one.

00:12:45.250 --> 00:12:46.290 align:middle line:90%
There's plenty more.

00:12:46.290 --> 00:12:48.230 align:middle line:84%
There's "The
Bachelor," any number

00:12:48.230 --> 00:12:49.620 align:middle line:84%
of quote unquote
"reality shows,"

00:12:49.620 --> 00:12:51.250 align:middle line:90%
"Dancing with the Stars."

00:12:51.250 --> 00:12:53.830 align:middle line:84%
And then there's social issues
that are distractions as well.

00:12:53.830 --> 00:12:56.870 align:middle line:84%
The same-sex marriage issue
is a massive distraction

00:12:56.870 --> 00:13:00.450 align:middle line:84%
in many ways, keeping people's
eyes off the real ball

00:13:00.450 --> 00:13:03.870 align:middle line:84%
here, which is the
reformation of the financial

00:13:03.870 --> 00:13:07.200 align:middle line:84%
and the economic system and
the entire political system

00:13:07.200 --> 00:13:08.993 align:middle line:90%
as well all across the globe.

00:13:08.993 --> 00:13:11.076 align:middle line:84%
So we have distractions
that we have to deal with.

00:13:11.076 --> 00:13:12.630 align:middle line:90%
We have to navigate through.

00:13:12.630 --> 00:13:16.020 align:middle line:84%
We have to be able to get
them out of our consciousness

00:13:16.020 --> 00:13:17.400 align:middle line:90%
as well.

00:13:17.400 --> 00:13:21.370 align:middle line:84%
The whole house of cards feels
like it's about to collapse.

00:13:21.370 --> 00:13:22.770 align:middle line:84%
I don't know how
many people I've

00:13:22.770 --> 00:13:27.840 align:middle line:84%
spoken with through my own
personal readings with them

00:13:27.840 --> 00:13:30.820 align:middle line:84%
or sessions or consultations,
where they feel

00:13:30.820 --> 00:13:34.130 align:middle line:84%
like the other shoe is about to
drop, that there is something

00:13:34.130 --> 00:13:39.780 align:middle line:84%
coming, that there is something
that is going to take place

00:13:39.780 --> 00:13:41.280 align:middle line:84%
that's going to
wipe everything out.

00:13:41.280 --> 00:13:44.187 align:middle line:84%
And this feeling has been going
on now for about the past four

00:13:44.187 --> 00:13:44.770 align:middle line:90%
or five years.

00:13:44.770 --> 00:13:46.570 align:middle line:84%
And it hasn't
quite happened yet,

00:13:46.570 --> 00:13:49.640 align:middle line:84%
but people are being
almost traumatized

00:13:49.640 --> 00:13:52.370 align:middle line:84%
to the point where they're
expecting something to occur.

00:13:52.370 --> 00:13:54.620 align:middle line:84%
They're expecting
that next thing

00:13:54.620 --> 00:13:58.950 align:middle line:84%
that's going to push
everything off the cliff.

00:13:58.950 --> 00:14:02.720 align:middle line:84%
And living with that has its own
level of stress and discomfort

00:14:02.720 --> 00:14:03.581 align:middle line:90%
and pressure.

00:14:03.581 --> 00:14:05.080 align:middle line:84%
So what I'm trying
to do here is I'm

00:14:05.080 --> 00:14:07.780 align:middle line:84%
trying to kind of
elucidate and articulate

00:14:07.780 --> 00:14:11.390 align:middle line:84%
what we're dealing with in our
society and our culture, which

00:14:11.390 --> 00:14:14.700 align:middle line:84%
adds a significant amount
of stress, pressure,

00:14:14.700 --> 00:14:16.659 align:middle line:84%
and gravity in
each of our lives.

00:14:16.659 --> 00:14:18.950 align:middle line:84%
And we have different ways
of coping and different ways

00:14:18.950 --> 00:14:22.389 align:middle line:84%
of dealing with these types
of conditions, some of which

00:14:22.389 --> 00:14:24.430 align:middle line:84%
are healthy, and some of
which aren't so healthy.

00:14:24.430 --> 00:14:26.121 align:middle line:90%
And you know, that's OK too.

00:14:26.121 --> 00:14:28.370 align:middle line:84%
We're allowed a few unhealthy
vices every now and then

00:14:28.370 --> 00:14:31.820 align:middle line:90%
to get us through the night.

00:14:31.820 --> 00:14:33.796 align:middle line:84%
So what I want to do
here with the next part

00:14:33.796 --> 00:14:35.170 align:middle line:84%
or the next segment
of the show--

00:14:35.170 --> 00:14:37.350 align:middle line:84%
I've kind of set this
up a little bit-- is

00:14:37.350 --> 00:14:41.030 align:middle line:84%
I want to show you what's
happening astrologically,

00:14:41.030 --> 00:14:44.080 align:middle line:84%
without getting too fractal,
without really getting

00:14:44.080 --> 00:14:47.590 align:middle line:84%
into too much minutia, without
breaking down the code,

00:14:47.590 --> 00:14:50.330 align:middle line:84%
and trying to show you the
meaning, or the meaning

00:14:50.330 --> 00:14:52.934 align:middle line:84%
behind the meaning, or to
discern the larger pattern.

00:14:52.934 --> 00:14:54.100 align:middle line:90%
I mean, that stuff is there.

00:14:54.100 --> 00:14:56.720 align:middle line:84%
And we do that here in
"The Eleventh House,"

00:14:56.720 --> 00:15:00.100 align:middle line:84%
and there are plenty of episodes
that you can tap into that.

00:15:00.100 --> 00:15:02.410 align:middle line:84%
But what I hope
to give you today

00:15:02.410 --> 00:15:05.920 align:middle line:84%
are some tools towards
empowerment, astrological and

00:15:05.920 --> 00:15:07.380 align:middle line:90%
personal empowerment.

00:15:07.380 --> 00:15:11.780 align:middle line:84%
This is the planet Uranus,
and this is the sign of Aries.

00:15:11.780 --> 00:15:14.790 align:middle line:84%
And it is obviously
symbolic of Uranus in Aries.

00:15:14.790 --> 00:15:17.670 align:middle line:84%
And it's actually kind of
a cool depiction of Uranus.

00:15:17.670 --> 00:15:20.140 align:middle line:84%
I like it with those little
rings on the outside.

00:15:20.140 --> 00:15:25.130 align:middle line:84%
So we are in Uranus and Aries,
and it has global implications.

00:15:25.130 --> 00:15:27.500 align:middle line:84%
We've seen this with some
of the color revolutions.

00:15:27.500 --> 00:15:30.170 align:middle line:84%
We've seen this with
things like surveillance.

00:15:30.170 --> 00:15:35.814 align:middle line:84%
Uranus is technology, and
Aries is the government.

00:15:35.814 --> 00:15:37.230 align:middle line:84%
Or it's not really
the government,

00:15:37.230 --> 00:15:40.880 align:middle line:84%
it is the military-industrial
apparatus and the state.

00:15:40.880 --> 00:15:44.995 align:middle line:84%
Perhaps even the NSA falls
into an Aries kind of bucket.

00:15:44.995 --> 00:15:50.220 align:middle line:84%
And so we've seen this kind
of flashpoint revelation

00:15:50.220 --> 00:15:51.792 align:middle line:90%
around surveillance and privacy.

00:15:51.792 --> 00:15:53.250 align:middle line:84%
And there's a lot
more that's going

00:15:53.250 --> 00:15:55.780 align:middle line:84%
to take place with
Uranus in Aries.

00:15:55.780 --> 00:15:57.295 align:middle line:84%
But one of the
things that I want

00:15:57.295 --> 00:15:58.670 align:middle line:84%
to give to you,
one of the things

00:15:58.670 --> 00:16:01.760 align:middle line:84%
that I want to share with you
that each and every one of you

00:16:01.760 --> 00:16:07.350 align:middle line:84%
has who are watching this video
right now is this quality.

00:16:07.350 --> 00:16:09.510 align:middle line:84%
It's the quality
to be inventive.

00:16:09.510 --> 00:16:12.160 align:middle line:84%
It's the quality of
being innovative.

00:16:12.160 --> 00:16:18.080 align:middle line:84%
It's the ability to use this
electric energy that Uranus

00:16:18.080 --> 00:16:23.350 align:middle line:84%
brings to our consciousness,
and this other energy,

00:16:23.350 --> 00:16:25.550 align:middle line:84%
which is Aries, which
is the individual, which

00:16:25.550 --> 00:16:27.080 align:middle line:90%
is the self, which is you.

00:16:27.080 --> 00:16:29.910 align:middle line:84%
And by the way,
Aries rules the head.

00:16:29.910 --> 00:16:34.080 align:middle line:84%
And so I thought that
this image really

00:16:34.080 --> 00:16:35.934 align:middle line:90%
typified Uranus in Aries.

00:16:35.934 --> 00:16:37.350 align:middle line:84%
So what are we
talking about here?

00:16:37.350 --> 00:16:39.129 align:middle line:84%
We're talking about
problem solving.

00:16:39.129 --> 00:16:40.420 align:middle line:90%
We're talking about innovation.

00:16:40.420 --> 00:16:42.420 align:middle line:84%
We're talking about
brainstorming,

00:16:42.420 --> 00:16:45.820 align:middle line:84%
being open to
inspiration, feeling

00:16:45.820 --> 00:16:49.860 align:middle line:84%
like you could tap
into a solution for not

00:16:49.860 --> 00:16:51.930 align:middle line:84%
just the situations
and challenges

00:16:51.930 --> 00:16:54.870 align:middle line:84%
and problems of
your life, but also

00:16:54.870 --> 00:16:57.100 align:middle line:84%
how you can help
humanity at large.

00:16:57.100 --> 00:17:00.380 align:middle line:84%
Again, this energy is
available for anybody.

00:17:00.380 --> 00:17:02.230 align:middle line:90%
Think of it as free energy.

00:17:02.230 --> 00:17:06.640 align:middle line:84%
Think of it as free energy of
the mind to free your mind up.

00:17:06.640 --> 00:17:08.750 align:middle line:84%
So one of the things
that you may want to do

00:17:08.750 --> 00:17:12.780 align:middle line:84%
is you may want to
affirm in your own life

00:17:12.780 --> 00:17:15.010 align:middle line:84%
that you are inventive,
that you are creative,

00:17:15.010 --> 00:17:18.180 align:middle line:84%
that you are innovative,
that you can be spontaneous,

00:17:18.180 --> 00:17:20.430 align:middle line:90%
that you can problem solve.

00:17:20.430 --> 00:17:22.680 align:middle line:84%
Because, again,
this is the current.

00:17:22.680 --> 00:17:26.180 align:middle line:84%
This is the astrological
current that is currently

00:17:26.180 --> 00:17:29.970 align:middle line:84%
operating not just on the
world stage, but in your life

00:17:29.970 --> 00:17:30.470 align:middle line:90%
as well.

00:17:30.470 --> 00:17:32.390 align:middle line:84%
So one of the things
that you can do

00:17:32.390 --> 00:17:36.040 align:middle line:84%
is you can find out where
Aries is in your chart,

00:17:36.040 --> 00:17:39.480 align:middle line:84%
because there's a pretty
good possibility that Uranus

00:17:39.480 --> 00:17:41.390 align:middle line:90%
is in that part of your chart.

00:17:41.390 --> 00:17:45.490 align:middle line:84%
So if it's in the, let's
say it's in the 11th house,

00:17:45.490 --> 00:17:47.020 align:middle line:84%
since we're in "The
Eleventh House,"

00:17:47.020 --> 00:17:50.590 align:middle line:84%
then you would use that
Uranian-Aries energy

00:17:50.590 --> 00:17:53.810 align:middle line:84%
to network, to connect
with people, to find out

00:17:53.810 --> 00:17:57.310 align:middle line:84%
who is doing really
innovative and inventive work

00:17:57.310 --> 00:18:02.880 align:middle line:84%
that you can tap into together
and create some form of almost

00:18:02.880 --> 00:18:05.630 align:middle line:84%
like a small brain,
where a number of people

00:18:05.630 --> 00:18:09.940 align:middle line:84%
can contribute their nodes of
consciousness to a problem,

00:18:09.940 --> 00:18:13.290 align:middle line:84%
or to a situation, or to
even maybe the formation

00:18:13.290 --> 00:18:16.420 align:middle line:84%
of some type of community,
either online or off.

00:18:16.420 --> 00:18:20.440 align:middle line:84%
So find out where Aries is in
your chart with your houses,

00:18:20.440 --> 00:18:24.500 align:middle line:84%
and then find out what's
connecting with Aries

00:18:24.500 --> 00:18:26.980 align:middle line:84%
with Uranus transiting
in your own chart.

00:18:26.980 --> 00:18:29.340 align:middle line:84%
So let's say you
have Mercury in Leo,

00:18:29.340 --> 00:18:31.070 align:middle line:84%
you've got a
Mercury-Uranus trine.

00:18:31.070 --> 00:18:33.690 align:middle line:84%
That's a perfect
time for you to tap

00:18:33.690 --> 00:18:37.560 align:middle line:84%
in to this kind of electric
and spontaneous information

00:18:37.560 --> 00:18:38.460 align:middle line:90%
and energy.

00:18:38.460 --> 00:18:40.530 align:middle line:90%
It's available to you.

00:18:40.530 --> 00:18:42.040 align:middle line:90%
It's not a malefic.

00:18:42.040 --> 00:18:45.420 align:middle line:84%
This is actually something
that could be quite empowering.

00:18:45.420 --> 00:18:51.110 align:middle line:84%
So be inventive, be innovative,
be creative, problem solve.

00:18:51.110 --> 00:18:53.760 align:middle line:90%


00:18:53.760 --> 00:18:59.340 align:middle line:84%
Neptune in Pisces,
Neptune in Pisces.

00:18:59.340 --> 00:19:01.560 align:middle line:84%
I think Neptune in
Pisces is really

00:19:01.560 --> 00:19:05.330 align:middle line:84%
the deep current of the
times that we're in.

00:19:05.330 --> 00:19:08.300 align:middle line:84%
Neptune rules Pisces,
and it rules things

00:19:08.300 --> 00:19:12.160 align:middle line:84%
like feelings of
mysticism and oneness

00:19:12.160 --> 00:19:15.370 align:middle line:84%
and the great dissolve
into the cosmic void.

00:19:15.370 --> 00:19:16.990 align:middle line:90%
It rules compassion.

00:19:16.990 --> 00:19:19.050 align:middle line:90%
It rules forgiveness.

00:19:19.050 --> 00:19:22.420 align:middle line:84%
There is this wonderful
quality with Pisces and Neptune

00:19:22.420 --> 00:19:26.540 align:middle line:84%
together, again, on a global
level, that will allow us

00:19:26.540 --> 00:19:30.720 align:middle line:84%
and can allow us to tap into
a much greater or higher

00:19:30.720 --> 00:19:33.490 align:middle line:84%
vibration of
spiritual awareness.

00:19:33.490 --> 00:19:35.200 align:middle line:84%
And that vibration of
spiritual awareness

00:19:35.200 --> 00:19:39.720 align:middle line:84%
is not some sort of solipsistic
seeking of self-gratification

00:19:39.720 --> 00:19:41.640 align:middle line:84%
through things like the
Secret or other kinds

00:19:41.640 --> 00:19:42.970 align:middle line:90%
of new-age strategies.

00:19:42.970 --> 00:19:46.290 align:middle line:84%
What it really is is you
getting in touch with your soul,

00:19:46.290 --> 00:19:48.960 align:middle line:84%
and sometimes getting in touch
with your soul can be painful.

00:19:48.960 --> 00:19:52.100 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes it's not
the easiest thing

00:19:52.100 --> 00:19:54.140 align:middle line:84%
to be able to do
because there are

00:19:54.140 --> 00:19:57.790 align:middle line:84%
things lurking on the
periphery of that experience

00:19:57.790 --> 00:19:59.812 align:middle line:90%
that could be quite painful.

00:19:59.812 --> 00:20:02.020 align:middle line:84%
To get your soul, you have
to go through the shadows.

00:20:02.020 --> 00:20:04.440 align:middle line:84%
You have to go through
the River Styx at times.

00:20:04.440 --> 00:20:07.100 align:middle line:84%
And then your destination,
like Dante, Dante

00:20:07.100 --> 00:20:09.330 align:middle line:84%
through the Inferno,
is the realization

00:20:09.330 --> 00:20:10.960 align:middle line:84%
that you do have a
soul, and your soul

00:20:10.960 --> 00:20:13.660 align:middle line:84%
is the conduit to a
higher consciousness

00:20:13.660 --> 00:20:15.800 align:middle line:84%
and to your relationship
with the divine.

00:20:15.800 --> 00:20:18.500 align:middle line:84%
One of the things
or the key word that

00:20:18.500 --> 00:20:21.610 align:middle line:84%
came to me as a result
of Neptune in Pisces

00:20:21.610 --> 00:20:23.110 align:middle line:90%
is compassion.

00:20:23.110 --> 00:20:25.350 align:middle line:84%
And I thought that this
image was terrific.

00:20:25.350 --> 00:20:28.430 align:middle line:84%
Here we have a soldier
who's obviously

00:20:28.430 --> 00:20:33.210 align:middle line:84%
found a wounded child, and
the child is covered in blood.

00:20:33.210 --> 00:20:36.140 align:middle line:84%
And this soldier has
grasped this child

00:20:36.140 --> 00:20:39.930 align:middle line:84%
and is obviously displaying
something fairly out

00:20:39.930 --> 00:20:43.360 align:middle line:84%
of character for both his
station and his uniform.

00:20:43.360 --> 00:20:48.000 align:middle line:84%
And I think that one of the
things that we can really

00:20:48.000 --> 00:20:51.130 align:middle line:84%
do a lot better job
with in our lives

00:20:51.130 --> 00:20:53.610 align:middle line:84%
is to be, number one,
compassionate with ourselves.

00:20:53.610 --> 00:20:56.920 align:middle line:84%
Because if we screw up,
if we fall, if we fail,

00:20:56.920 --> 00:21:00.584 align:middle line:84%
some of the fallback has been to
be super critical of the things

00:21:00.584 --> 00:21:01.250 align:middle line:90%
that we've done.

00:21:01.250 --> 00:21:03.380 align:middle line:84%
Now, there's a whole
other psychology

00:21:03.380 --> 00:21:05.476 align:middle line:90%
that's being put into play.

00:21:05.476 --> 00:21:06.850 align:middle line:84%
I think some of
you have probably

00:21:06.850 --> 00:21:09.550 align:middle line:84%
seen the movie "Chosen,"
the song "Let it Go."

00:21:09.550 --> 00:21:11.614 align:middle line:84%
That's a whole
other sort of piece

00:21:11.614 --> 00:21:13.780 align:middle line:84%
that we're having to kind
of deal with and integrate

00:21:13.780 --> 00:21:15.260 align:middle line:90%
with in our lives.

00:21:15.260 --> 00:21:19.045 align:middle line:84%
But really, for me, the
fundamental vibration

00:21:19.045 --> 00:21:21.320 align:middle line:84%
or the base note
for all of this is

00:21:21.320 --> 00:21:25.980 align:middle line:84%
compassion and to be able
to allow oneself to feel it

00:21:25.980 --> 00:21:29.930 align:middle line:84%
on an individual level, on
a personal level with people

00:21:29.930 --> 00:21:32.810 align:middle line:84%
in your lives, on a
transpersonal level,

00:21:32.810 --> 00:21:33.700 align:middle line:90%
on a global level.

00:21:33.700 --> 00:21:35.940 align:middle line:90%
It all starts with you.

00:21:35.940 --> 00:21:39.610 align:middle line:84%
And if you can cultivate,
really cultivate

00:21:39.610 --> 00:21:42.120 align:middle line:84%
a sense of compassion,
and compassion

00:21:42.120 --> 00:21:45.280 align:middle line:84%
allows you to understand
another person's suffering,

00:21:45.280 --> 00:21:49.241 align:middle line:84%
to be empathetic, to be in
touch with your emotional body,

00:21:49.241 --> 00:21:50.990 align:middle line:84%
which, by the way, is
not always in vogue.

00:21:50.990 --> 00:21:54.860 align:middle line:84%
If you can do that, then
you open yourself up

00:21:54.860 --> 00:21:59.240 align:middle line:84%
to other qualities like grace
and forgiveness and surrender.

00:21:59.240 --> 00:22:02.560 align:middle line:84%
And these are all part and
parcel of Neptune in Pisces.

00:22:02.560 --> 00:22:05.855 align:middle line:84%
So with Neptune in Pisces,
one of the great qualities

00:22:05.855 --> 00:22:09.900 align:middle line:84%
and aspects we get to
experience is compassion.

00:22:09.900 --> 00:22:12.790 align:middle line:84%
Find out where Pisces
is in your chart,

00:22:12.790 --> 00:22:16.590 align:middle line:84%
because that's generally
were Neptune is going to be.

00:22:16.590 --> 00:22:20.470 align:middle line:84%
And when you see that, and then
you see the house that it's in,

00:22:20.470 --> 00:22:23.030 align:middle line:84%
that can be, for you,
the point of compassion

00:22:23.030 --> 00:22:25.620 align:middle line:84%
that you get to
practice and work on.

00:22:25.620 --> 00:22:26.780 align:middle line:90%
That is the entry point.

00:22:26.780 --> 00:22:29.120 align:middle line:84%
That is the portal
where you can dive

00:22:29.120 --> 00:22:35.510 align:middle line:84%
into that compassionate pool
of regeneration and grace

00:22:35.510 --> 00:22:37.310 align:middle line:90%
and even divine love.

00:22:37.310 --> 00:22:39.590 align:middle line:84%
Now, again, you want to find
out what the angles are.

00:22:39.590 --> 00:22:40.870 align:middle line:90%
What's happening?

00:22:40.870 --> 00:22:43.890 align:middle line:84%
What planets do you
have that are operating

00:22:43.890 --> 00:22:46.810 align:middle line:84%
in some sort of
aspect with Neptune?

00:22:46.810 --> 00:22:50.501 align:middle line:84%
In my chart, I have a
Neptune-Neptune trine going on,

00:22:50.501 --> 00:22:52.500 align:middle line:84%
which is maybe why I'm
talking about compassion,

00:22:52.500 --> 00:22:56.990 align:middle line:84%
maybe why I'm making such
a big deal out of this.

00:22:56.990 --> 00:22:58.000 align:middle line:90%
Pluto in Capricorn.

00:22:58.000 --> 00:23:02.450 align:middle line:84%
This is the third of the
outer planets, the biggie.

00:23:02.450 --> 00:23:04.485 align:middle line:10%
And we're dealing with
Pluto in Capricorn

00:23:04.485 --> 00:23:06.110 align:middle line:10%
in a very
interesting-- I mean, I

00:23:06.110 --> 00:23:07.795 align:middle line:10%
know a lot of people
who are-- Pluto's

00:23:07.795 --> 00:23:11.590 align:middle line:10%
been in Capricorn since 2009,
and people are tired of it

00:23:11.590 --> 00:23:12.550 align:middle line:10%
already.

00:23:12.550 --> 00:23:16.300 align:middle line:10%
And it's going to be in
Capricorn until 2021,

00:23:16.300 --> 00:23:19.830 align:middle line:10%
so we've got a long haul with
Pluto in Capricorn still.

00:23:19.830 --> 00:23:21.515 align:middle line:10%
And it has been relentless.

00:23:21.515 --> 00:23:22.390 align:middle line:90%
It has been rigorous.

00:23:22.390 --> 00:23:24.470 align:middle line:90%
It has been grinding us.

00:23:24.470 --> 00:23:26.590 align:middle line:84%
For a lot of people,
Pluto in Capricorn

00:23:26.590 --> 00:23:29.030 align:middle line:90%
has brought up survival issues.

00:23:29.030 --> 00:23:32.150 align:middle line:84%
People have lost their jobs
during Pluto in Capricorn.

00:23:32.150 --> 00:23:36.050 align:middle line:84%
Young people, students,
have massive amounts of debt

00:23:36.050 --> 00:23:39.790 align:middle line:84%
from student loans, and
the jobs just aren't there

00:23:39.790 --> 00:23:42.690 align:middle line:84%
on the back end of their
academic experience.

00:23:42.690 --> 00:23:44.670 align:middle line:84%
So they're having to
deal with their own Pluto

00:23:44.670 --> 00:23:46.430 align:middle line:90%
in Capricorn issues.

00:23:46.430 --> 00:23:49.250 align:middle line:84%
There's a sense here
with Pluto in Capricorn

00:23:49.250 --> 00:23:52.530 align:middle line:84%
that the chess pieces are being
moved around on a global level

00:23:52.530 --> 00:23:54.650 align:middle line:90%
and that you don't count, right?

00:23:54.650 --> 00:23:57.010 align:middle line:90%
You don't count.

00:23:57.010 --> 00:23:59.600 align:middle line:84%
It's like there's no
more kind of care.

00:23:59.600 --> 00:24:02.800 align:middle line:84%
There's no more compassion
for you as an individual

00:24:02.800 --> 00:24:06.200 align:middle line:90%
or even a consumer in some ways.

00:24:06.200 --> 00:24:10.140 align:middle line:84%
This is what I think the
masses are dealing with here.

00:24:10.140 --> 00:24:12.860 align:middle line:84%
And as a result, what
are we going to do?

00:24:12.860 --> 00:24:15.230 align:middle line:84%
How are we going
to deal with this?

00:24:15.230 --> 00:24:17.690 align:middle line:84%
We talk a lot about
bullying in our society.

00:24:17.690 --> 00:24:25.300 align:middle line:84%
There is a form of economic
and socioeconomic bullying

00:24:25.300 --> 00:24:27.110 align:middle line:84%
that's taking place at
a pretty high level.

00:24:27.110 --> 00:24:29.870 align:middle line:90%
It's not talked about very much.

00:24:29.870 --> 00:24:31.740 align:middle line:84%
We tend to distill
that discussion

00:24:31.740 --> 00:24:34.260 align:middle line:84%
and put it into playgrounds,
the context of playgrounds

00:24:34.260 --> 00:24:35.450 align:middle line:90%
or schools.

00:24:35.450 --> 00:24:37.860 align:middle line:84%
But truly, there's something
going on at a higher level.

00:24:37.860 --> 00:24:40.060 align:middle line:90%
And what are you going to do?

00:24:40.060 --> 00:24:41.950 align:middle line:84%
How are you going to
get through this time?

00:24:41.950 --> 00:24:44.260 align:middle line:84%
How are you going
to get stronger?

00:24:44.260 --> 00:24:46.390 align:middle line:90%
How are you going to push back?

00:24:46.390 --> 00:24:49.390 align:middle line:84%
The whole bullying thing is
quite interesting in some ways.

00:24:49.390 --> 00:24:51.620 align:middle line:84%
And it's come to our
awareness, and yeah, bullying

00:24:51.620 --> 00:24:53.250 align:middle line:90%
is not great.

00:24:53.250 --> 00:24:56.410 align:middle line:84%
But in a weird way, it
actually serves a purpose,

00:24:56.410 --> 00:24:57.960 align:middle line:90%
especially when you're young.

00:24:57.960 --> 00:25:00.100 align:middle line:84%
Because what bullying
does is it gets

00:25:00.100 --> 00:25:06.667 align:middle line:84%
people to either get stronger or
to recreate themselves and move

00:25:06.667 --> 00:25:07.750 align:middle line:90%
themselves out of the way.

00:25:07.750 --> 00:25:11.850 align:middle line:84%
It's almost like a kind of
a psychic and spiritual form

00:25:11.850 --> 00:25:15.290 align:middle line:84%
of building up immunity
in a weird way.

00:25:15.290 --> 00:25:18.790 align:middle line:84%
And so if you can
rise to the occasion,

00:25:18.790 --> 00:25:21.270 align:middle line:84%
and you can meet
that test, and you

00:25:21.270 --> 00:25:25.440 align:middle line:84%
can stare that bully in the
eye, and you can say, enough,

00:25:25.440 --> 00:25:28.890 align:middle line:84%
or I won't do this,
or you can push back

00:25:28.890 --> 00:25:32.250 align:middle line:84%
in a way that is
really empowering,

00:25:32.250 --> 00:25:35.420 align:middle line:84%
you've actually conquered
a fair amount of fear.

00:25:35.420 --> 00:25:39.130 align:middle line:84%
You've actually gone through a
rite of passage in some ways.

00:25:39.130 --> 00:25:41.430 align:middle line:84%
And unfortunately,
what's happening now

00:25:41.430 --> 00:25:45.410 align:middle line:84%
is we're sort of being
redirected and having people

00:25:45.410 --> 00:25:47.670 align:middle line:84%
in positions of
power and authority

00:25:47.670 --> 00:25:50.080 align:middle line:84%
take care of those things
for us, which sets up

00:25:50.080 --> 00:25:53.030 align:middle line:84%
a whole other set of
behaviors as well.

00:25:53.030 --> 00:25:55.180 align:middle line:84%
I guess what I'm getting
at here and using

00:25:55.180 --> 00:25:58.530 align:middle line:84%
bullying as kind of an example
with Pluto in Capricorn

00:25:58.530 --> 00:26:02.240 align:middle line:84%
is, on some level, it's
not about pushing back,

00:26:02.240 --> 00:26:03.854 align:middle line:84%
but it's about
staring this down.

00:26:03.854 --> 00:26:05.770 align:middle line:84%
It's about dealing with
it and dealing with it

00:26:05.770 --> 00:26:10.640 align:middle line:84%
in our own individual way and
finding our own place of power

00:26:10.640 --> 00:26:15.620 align:middle line:84%
inside this massive shift of
power in Pluto in Capricorn

00:26:15.620 --> 00:26:18.810 align:middle line:84%
to the corporatocracy,
to the plutocracy, which

00:26:18.810 --> 00:26:20.990 align:middle line:84%
has been taking
place since 2009.

00:26:20.990 --> 00:26:22.730 align:middle line:90%
And how do we do that?

00:26:22.730 --> 00:26:24.950 align:middle line:90%
Endurance, endurance.

00:26:24.950 --> 00:26:27.050 align:middle line:84%
Capricorn is all
about endurance.

00:26:27.050 --> 00:26:29.140 align:middle line:90%
It's all about the long now.

00:26:29.140 --> 00:26:31.780 align:middle line:84%
It's about long
time, the long tale

00:26:31.780 --> 00:26:35.340 align:middle line:84%
that life is not a
momentary experience.

00:26:35.340 --> 00:26:40.080 align:middle line:84%
It is not something that
you experience in a second.

00:26:40.080 --> 00:26:41.290 align:middle line:90%
I mean, it can be.

00:26:41.290 --> 00:26:42.130 align:middle line:90%
It can be.

00:26:42.130 --> 00:26:45.070 align:middle line:84%
But Capricorn,
what it does is it

00:26:45.070 --> 00:26:50.330 align:middle line:84%
expands your view and
your ideal of time.

00:26:50.330 --> 00:26:53.940 align:middle line:84%
And so what we need to do or
what would be very helpful

00:26:53.940 --> 00:26:57.490 align:middle line:84%
is if we can see ourselves
as being part of a continuum,

00:26:57.490 --> 00:26:59.910 align:middle line:84%
because that's also what
Capricorn represents.

00:26:59.910 --> 00:27:03.150 align:middle line:84%
It represents a continuum
and hierarchies and legacies.

00:27:03.150 --> 00:27:06.770 align:middle line:84%
And that where we are and
what we're doing now counts,

00:27:06.770 --> 00:27:09.650 align:middle line:84%
and that it moves
forward into the future.

00:27:09.650 --> 00:27:12.700 align:middle line:84%
Whatever that future is,
even if you cannot see it,

00:27:12.700 --> 00:27:16.250 align:middle line:84%
even if you don't have a
vision, know that we are headed

00:27:16.250 --> 00:27:19.525 align:middle line:84%
somewhere, that there is
a place that we're going.

00:27:19.525 --> 00:27:22.911 align:middle line:84%
And the key to getting
there is endurance.

00:27:22.911 --> 00:27:23.910 align:middle line:90%
And what does that mean?

00:27:23.910 --> 00:27:25.576 align:middle line:84%
Well, it means that
you're going to need

00:27:25.576 --> 00:27:26.870 align:middle line:90%
to be strong physically.

00:27:26.870 --> 00:27:28.932 align:middle line:84%
You're going to need to
be strong emotionally.

00:27:28.932 --> 00:27:30.890 align:middle line:84%
And you're going to need
to be strong mentally.

00:27:30.890 --> 00:27:33.750 align:middle line:84%
This is a really
challenging time.

00:27:33.750 --> 00:27:36.900 align:middle line:84%
And Pluto in Capricorn,
in my estimation,

00:27:36.900 --> 00:27:40.454 align:middle line:84%
is the initiation of the
human race on planet Earth.

00:27:40.454 --> 00:27:42.120 align:middle line:84%
That's exactly what
we're going through.

00:27:42.120 --> 00:27:45.360 align:middle line:84%
And if you want to be here, you
have to commit to being here.

00:27:45.360 --> 00:27:46.190 align:middle line:90%
That's part of it.

00:27:46.190 --> 00:27:49.975 align:middle line:84%
Pluto does not have
any-- it's not passive.

00:27:49.975 --> 00:27:51.670 align:middle line:90%
There's no grey area with Pluto.

00:27:51.670 --> 00:27:53.170 align:middle line:90%
It's black and white.

00:27:53.170 --> 00:27:54.961 align:middle line:84%
So if you want to
be on the planet,

00:27:54.961 --> 00:27:56.210 align:middle line:90%
commit to being on the planet.

00:27:56.210 --> 00:27:57.630 align:middle line:84%
And if you're going to commit
to being on the planet,

00:27:57.630 --> 00:27:59.240 align:middle line:84%
then you've got to
commit all the way.

00:27:59.240 --> 00:28:00.355 align:middle line:90%
You've got to be strong.

00:28:00.355 --> 00:28:01.730 align:middle line:84%
You've got to
build your body up.

00:28:01.730 --> 00:28:02.950 align:middle line:84%
You've got to build
your immunity up.

00:28:02.950 --> 00:28:04.890 align:middle line:84%
You've got to build
all these things up,

00:28:04.890 --> 00:28:07.310 align:middle line:84%
even if your
resources are limited.

00:28:07.310 --> 00:28:10.080 align:middle line:84%
And if you commit to it,
if you commit to this,

00:28:10.080 --> 00:28:11.760 align:middle line:84%
and you are willing
to endure, if you're

00:28:11.760 --> 00:28:16.000 align:middle line:84%
willing to go the distance,
the marathon in your own life,

00:28:16.000 --> 00:28:18.690 align:middle line:84%
then you will be given
exactly what you need in order

00:28:18.690 --> 00:28:20.760 align:middle line:84%
to do that because
that's how it works.

00:28:20.760 --> 00:28:22.570 align:middle line:84%
Endurance, a very
important part.

00:28:22.570 --> 00:28:24.500 align:middle line:84%
Find out where Capricorn
is in your chart.

00:28:24.500 --> 00:28:25.130 align:middle line:90%
What zone?

00:28:25.130 --> 00:28:27.230 align:middle line:84%
What sector is
Capricorn showing up?

00:28:27.230 --> 00:28:30.150 align:middle line:84%
That's where Pluto is, and it's
going to be there for a while.

00:28:30.150 --> 00:28:33.360 align:middle line:84%
But it's also going to be
aspecting other planets.

00:28:33.360 --> 00:28:37.660 align:middle line:84%
So it's a pretty sophisticated
and nuanced relationship

00:28:37.660 --> 00:28:39.720 align:middle line:90%
with this very intense energy.

00:28:39.720 --> 00:28:42.500 align:middle line:84%
And if you are willing
to tap into it,

00:28:42.500 --> 00:28:45.090 align:middle line:84%
and you're willing to commit
to it, it will work with you.

00:28:45.090 --> 00:28:47.246 align:middle line:90%
Trust me on this.

00:28:47.246 --> 00:28:47.745 align:middle line:90%
Saturn.

00:28:47.745 --> 00:28:49.100 align:middle line:90%
Saturn's a big player right now.

00:28:49.100 --> 00:28:50.266 align:middle line:90%
It's in the sign of Scorpio.

00:28:50.266 --> 00:28:52.670 align:middle line:90%


00:28:52.670 --> 00:28:55.410 align:middle line:84%
There are three things I want to
talk about here over the course

00:28:55.410 --> 00:28:56.825 align:middle line:84%
of the rest of
this presentation,

00:28:56.825 --> 00:28:58.530 align:middle line:90%
the rest of this episode.

00:28:58.530 --> 00:29:00.300 align:middle line:90%
Saturn is one of them.

00:29:00.300 --> 00:29:03.720 align:middle line:84%
The True Node is the other,
and Chiron is the third.

00:29:03.720 --> 00:29:06.690 align:middle line:84%
So Saturn is that
thing in our charts

00:29:06.690 --> 00:29:09.321 align:middle line:84%
where we keep coming back to
time and time and time and time

00:29:09.321 --> 00:29:09.820 align:middle line:90%
again.

00:29:09.820 --> 00:29:11.650 align:middle line:84%
It's related to
Capricorn obviously,

00:29:11.650 --> 00:29:13.100 align:middle line:90%
which we just talked about.

00:29:13.100 --> 00:29:16.290 align:middle line:84%
And Saturn is the planet
of the life lesson.

00:29:16.290 --> 00:29:17.890 align:middle line:90%
Some people call it karma.

00:29:17.890 --> 00:29:19.500 align:middle line:84%
It's the planet of
the life lesson.

00:29:19.500 --> 00:29:21.182 align:middle line:84%
Wherever Saturn shows
up in your chart,

00:29:21.182 --> 00:29:22.640 align:middle line:84%
that is what you
are here to learn.

00:29:22.640 --> 00:29:24.820 align:middle line:84%
That is what you
are here to master.

00:29:24.820 --> 00:29:26.500 align:middle line:84%
And Saturn right
now is currently

00:29:26.500 --> 00:29:28.120 align:middle line:90%
in the sign of Scorpio.

00:29:28.120 --> 00:29:29.870 align:middle line:84%
So what are we
doing collectively

00:29:29.870 --> 00:29:31.480 align:middle line:90%
with Saturn in Scorpio?

00:29:31.480 --> 00:29:35.520 align:middle line:84%
What are we doing in order to
bring that into our own lives?

00:29:35.520 --> 00:29:39.395 align:middle line:90%
Well, Scorpio is sexual energy.

00:29:39.395 --> 00:29:41.395 align:middle line:90%
That's what Scorpio represents.

00:29:41.395 --> 00:29:42.730 align:middle line:90%
It's what it symbolizes.

00:29:42.730 --> 00:29:43.630 align:middle line:90%
It's magnetic.

00:29:43.630 --> 00:29:44.680 align:middle line:90%
It's powerful.

00:29:44.680 --> 00:29:46.450 align:middle line:90%
It comes from the sacral region.

00:29:46.450 --> 00:29:48.710 align:middle line:84%
And when we have
Saturn interacting

00:29:48.710 --> 00:29:53.140 align:middle line:84%
with Scorpio, what we're being
asked of on a global level,

00:29:53.140 --> 00:29:56.360 align:middle line:84%
on a collective level, and on an
individual level is to harness

00:29:56.360 --> 00:29:58.760 align:middle line:84%
that power, is to
channel, is to use it

00:29:58.760 --> 00:30:02.210 align:middle line:84%
in ways that are going
to be productive for us.

00:30:02.210 --> 00:30:07.890 align:middle line:84%
So it's about really kind of
reconsidering and reevaluating

00:30:07.890 --> 00:30:10.120 align:middle line:84%
our relationship with
our own sexual energy,

00:30:10.120 --> 00:30:12.000 align:middle line:90%
with our own primal energy.

00:30:12.000 --> 00:30:13.030 align:middle line:90%
How are we using it?

00:30:13.030 --> 00:30:14.350 align:middle line:90%
What are we doing with it?

00:30:14.350 --> 00:30:17.170 align:middle line:84%
Are we allowing it
to have some kind

00:30:17.170 --> 00:30:20.190 align:middle line:84%
of real channel in our
lives, or are we blocked?

00:30:20.190 --> 00:30:22.120 align:middle line:84%
Because sometimes
Saturn will also

00:30:22.120 --> 00:30:24.080 align:middle line:84%
represent some form
of blockage as well,

00:30:24.080 --> 00:30:25.650 align:middle line:90%
some form of limitation.

00:30:25.650 --> 00:30:28.270 align:middle line:84%
How can we break through
those forms of limitation

00:30:28.270 --> 00:30:30.110 align:middle line:84%
with our own
personal power, i.e.

00:30:30.110 --> 00:30:31.830 align:middle line:84%
Scorpio's sexual
power, all the things

00:30:31.830 --> 00:30:33.940 align:middle line:90%
that go along with that as well?

00:30:33.940 --> 00:30:36.650 align:middle line:84%
Is your sexual energy
all over the place?

00:30:36.650 --> 00:30:38.210 align:middle line:90%
Maybe you need to rein it in.

00:30:38.210 --> 00:30:40.900 align:middle line:84%
That's part of what we're going
through on an individual level,

00:30:40.900 --> 00:30:42.670 align:middle line:84%
but also on a collective
level as well.

00:30:42.670 --> 00:30:46.530 align:middle line:84%
Find out, find out where
Scorpio is in your chart

00:30:46.530 --> 00:30:48.320 align:middle line:90%
and track it with Saturn.

00:30:48.320 --> 00:30:51.187 align:middle line:84%
And you'll see that
there are themes

00:30:51.187 --> 00:30:53.520 align:middle line:84%
that are going to be taking
place with Saturn in Scorpio

00:30:53.520 --> 00:30:57.740 align:middle line:84%
and, again, the association
with other planets and aspects

00:30:57.740 --> 00:30:58.600 align:middle line:90%
in your chart.

00:30:58.600 --> 00:30:59.650 align:middle line:90%
I just love this image.

00:30:59.650 --> 00:31:03.900 align:middle line:84%
This, to me, this is the
image of sacral energy.

00:31:03.900 --> 00:31:05.400 align:middle line:90%
It's creative.

00:31:05.400 --> 00:31:06.140 align:middle line:90%
It's vivid.

00:31:06.140 --> 00:31:07.420 align:middle line:90%
It's vibrant.

00:31:07.420 --> 00:31:09.460 align:middle line:84%
And this, through
Saturn in Scorpio,

00:31:09.460 --> 00:31:13.455 align:middle line:84%
I think is what we're
here to channel, this own,

00:31:13.455 --> 00:31:15.401 align:middle line:90%
this power on a personal level.

00:31:15.401 --> 00:31:15.900 align:middle line:90%
It's here.

00:31:15.900 --> 00:31:16.525 align:middle line:90%
It's available.

00:31:16.525 --> 00:31:17.200 align:middle line:90%
It's open to us.

00:31:17.200 --> 00:31:19.280 align:middle line:84%
Now, Saturn's going to
be moving and shifting,

00:31:19.280 --> 00:31:21.190 align:middle line:84%
and it's going to take
place in December.

00:31:21.190 --> 00:31:23.920 align:middle line:84%
And it moves into the
sign of Sagittarius,

00:31:23.920 --> 00:31:26.360 align:middle line:84%
which is a very, very
different energy.

00:31:26.360 --> 00:31:28.270 align:middle line:84%
Sagittarius
represents religions.

00:31:28.270 --> 00:31:30.680 align:middle line:90%
It represents sacred law.

00:31:30.680 --> 00:31:33.610 align:middle line:84%
And I think that what's going
to take place during Saturn

00:31:33.610 --> 00:31:35.600 align:middle line:84%
in Sagittarius on
a collective level,

00:31:35.600 --> 00:31:38.580 align:middle line:84%
but also on an individual
level, is that many of us

00:31:38.580 --> 00:31:45.250 align:middle line:84%
are going to reaffirm
some kind of relationship

00:31:45.250 --> 00:31:47.820 align:middle line:84%
with the divine, because
that's what Sagittarius does.

00:31:47.820 --> 00:31:52.010 align:middle line:84%
It gives us this sense that
we are connected to something

00:31:52.010 --> 00:31:55.150 align:middle line:84%
greater to ourselves, and
we expand outward or inward,

00:31:55.150 --> 00:31:59.250 align:middle line:84%
whichever sort of direction in
this multi-dimensional universe

00:31:59.250 --> 00:32:00.420 align:middle line:90%
you want to travel in.

00:32:00.420 --> 00:32:05.190 align:middle line:84%
So part of channeling and
grounding and funneling

00:32:05.190 --> 00:32:08.200 align:middle line:84%
the energy of Saturn once
it shifts in December

00:32:08.200 --> 00:32:09.300 align:middle line:90%
is sacred energy.

00:32:09.300 --> 00:32:12.990 align:middle line:84%
So we go from the
sacral to the sacred.

00:32:12.990 --> 00:32:14.720 align:middle line:84%
And it's going to
be in Sagittarius

00:32:14.720 --> 00:32:16.420 align:middle line:90%
for 2 and 1/2 years.

00:32:16.420 --> 00:32:18.430 align:middle line:84%
So it can be a
really creative time

00:32:18.430 --> 00:32:20.820 align:middle line:84%
for everybody to
realign themselves

00:32:20.820 --> 00:32:23.710 align:middle line:84%
with what it means to
live a sacred existence

00:32:23.710 --> 00:32:24.690 align:middle line:90%
or a sacred experience.

00:32:24.690 --> 00:32:26.184 align:middle line:84%
And that's up to
you to determine.

00:32:26.184 --> 00:32:28.100 align:middle line:84%
I'm not here to tell you
what that is for you.

00:32:28.100 --> 00:32:30.020 align:middle line:84%
I'm just telling
you that that energy

00:32:30.020 --> 00:32:33.800 align:middle line:84%
is going to be
available for everyone.

00:32:33.800 --> 00:32:34.606 align:middle line:90%
Chiron.

00:32:34.606 --> 00:32:37.240 align:middle line:84%
You know, I had never
seen this image before.

00:32:37.240 --> 00:32:40.180 align:middle line:84%
This is an image of Chiron, and
it's drawn by William Blake.

00:32:40.180 --> 00:32:43.247 align:middle line:84%
And I'm a big William
Blake guy, but I'd never

00:32:43.247 --> 00:32:45.080 align:middle line:84%
realized that Blake had
done this rendering.

00:32:45.080 --> 00:32:47.100 align:middle line:90%
So Chiron is the wounded healer.

00:32:47.100 --> 00:32:49.410 align:middle line:84%
It's a really important
part of the chart.

00:32:49.410 --> 00:32:52.890 align:middle line:84%
And if you want to understand
your Achilles heel, which

00:32:52.890 --> 00:32:55.650 align:middle line:84%
has to be healed, it has to
be brought into your life,

00:32:55.650 --> 00:32:56.950 align:middle line:90%
you must understand Chiron.

00:32:56.950 --> 00:32:57.836 align:middle line:90%
You must know Chiron.

00:32:57.836 --> 00:32:59.210 align:middle line:84%
And for a lot of
people that were

00:32:59.210 --> 00:33:02.894 align:middle line:84%
born during the mid '60s
and even the early '70s,

00:33:02.894 --> 00:33:05.060 align:middle line:84%
you're going to be going
through your Chiron return.

00:33:05.060 --> 00:33:06.520 align:middle line:90%
And Chiron is in Pisces.

00:33:06.520 --> 00:33:08.380 align:middle line:84%
A lot of you are going
through it right now.

00:33:08.380 --> 00:33:10.880 align:middle line:84%
So this generation
or sub-generation,

00:33:10.880 --> 00:33:14.220 align:middle line:84%
what you're experiencing
is the reintegration

00:33:14.220 --> 00:33:16.760 align:middle line:84%
of what it's like to be a
religious or a spiritual person

00:33:16.760 --> 00:33:19.370 align:middle line:84%
without shame, without
any kind of consequence,

00:33:19.370 --> 00:33:21.110 align:middle line:90%
without any kind of guilt.

00:33:21.110 --> 00:33:23.640 align:middle line:84%
You're ready and willing to
embrace that, accept that,

00:33:23.640 --> 00:33:27.120 align:middle line:84%
and live that as an
integrated part of your life.

00:33:27.120 --> 00:33:29.440 align:middle line:84%
And Chiron's in Pisces
right now, so in some ways,

00:33:29.440 --> 00:33:32.210 align:middle line:84%
we're all being asked to
do that on some level,

00:33:32.210 --> 00:33:38.550 align:middle line:84%
while we also ferret out in
other aspects the illusion

00:33:38.550 --> 00:33:41.830 align:middle line:84%
of religion, the
illusion of separation.

00:33:41.830 --> 00:33:46.776 align:middle line:84%
All these things that kind of
have gone along part and parcel

00:33:46.776 --> 00:33:50.540 align:middle line:84%
with the business of religion,
with the churchianity

00:33:50.540 --> 00:33:53.540 align:middle line:84%
is what some people call it,
the franchising of religion.

00:33:53.540 --> 00:33:57.510 align:middle line:84%
Chiron in Pisces gets us in
touch with the shallowness

00:33:57.510 --> 00:33:59.450 align:middle line:84%
and the failure of some
of those institutions

00:33:59.450 --> 00:34:02.200 align:middle line:84%
to live up to what we
thought that they could

00:34:02.200 --> 00:34:04.560 align:middle line:90%
be at some point long, long ago.

00:34:04.560 --> 00:34:06.315 align:middle line:90%
So here's Chiron.

00:34:06.315 --> 00:34:08.440 align:middle line:84%
You want to find out where
Chiron is in your chart,

00:34:08.440 --> 00:34:10.920 align:middle line:84%
because that is, in some
ways, the key to your chart.

00:34:10.920 --> 00:34:12.620 align:middle line:90%
That is your secret.

00:34:12.620 --> 00:34:13.120 align:middle line:90%
Here we go.

00:34:13.120 --> 00:34:14.580 align:middle line:90%
Chiron is the key.

00:34:14.580 --> 00:34:18.770 align:middle line:84%
And these are some phrases
that I came up with for you.

00:34:18.770 --> 00:34:20.290 align:middle line:10%
Own your own pain.

00:34:20.290 --> 00:34:21.540 align:middle line:10%
That's what Chiron is about.

00:34:21.540 --> 00:34:22.290 align:middle line:10%
Own your own pain.

00:34:22.290 --> 00:34:22.870 align:middle line:10%
Own it.

00:34:22.870 --> 00:34:24.460 align:middle line:10%
It's nobody's else's pain.

00:34:24.460 --> 00:34:27.005 align:middle line:10%
And then once you own
it and sift through it

00:34:27.005 --> 00:34:29.860 align:middle line:10%
and work with it, use it
as a healing modality,

00:34:29.860 --> 00:34:33.350 align:middle line:10%
then you can move through it
and integrate it into your life.

00:34:33.350 --> 00:34:34.159 align:middle line:10%
Own your shame.

00:34:34.159 --> 00:34:38.090 align:middle line:10%
Chiron, Chiron is, in some
ways, the expositor of shame.

00:34:38.090 --> 00:34:40.239 align:middle line:84%
It shows us those
areas in our lives

00:34:40.239 --> 00:34:44.600 align:middle line:84%
where we hide things, where we
put things away from the prying

00:34:44.600 --> 00:34:49.130 align:middle line:84%
eyes of our parents, or our
schools, or society at large.

00:34:49.130 --> 00:34:51.909 align:middle line:84%
And when you go through an
intense Chiron moment, when

00:34:51.909 --> 00:34:53.889 align:middle line:84%
there's an aspect
of a planet that's

00:34:53.889 --> 00:34:55.400 align:middle line:84%
hitting your
Chiron, where you're

00:34:55.400 --> 00:34:56.900 align:middle line:84%
going through your
Chiron return,

00:34:56.900 --> 00:35:01.010 align:middle line:84%
which, again, a lot of you
are, then you get to own that.

00:35:01.010 --> 00:35:02.210 align:middle line:90%
You get to integrate that.

00:35:02.210 --> 00:35:03.560 align:middle line:90%
You get to deal with it.

00:35:03.560 --> 00:35:05.340 align:middle line:84%
I'll give you an example
with my own life.

00:35:05.340 --> 00:35:09.170 align:middle line:84%
I have Chiron in Aquarius,
and it's in the third house.

00:35:09.170 --> 00:35:12.530 align:middle line:84%
And I experienced that in
a couple of different ways.

00:35:12.530 --> 00:35:14.490 align:middle line:84%
I grew up as an
only child, and I

00:35:14.490 --> 00:35:17.790 align:middle line:84%
had parents that used
polysyllabic words.

00:35:17.790 --> 00:35:20.989 align:middle line:84%
So I had a fairly evolved
vocabulary when I was a kid.

00:35:20.989 --> 00:35:23.530 align:middle line:84%
So I'd use these words, because
I'd use them with my parents,

00:35:23.530 --> 00:35:26.650 align:middle line:84%
and I'd use them at school, and
I got a lot of grief for that.

00:35:26.650 --> 00:35:31.350 align:middle line:84%
And so what I did is I decided
to scale down my vocabulary.

00:35:31.350 --> 00:35:32.770 align:middle line:84%
And I didn't know
it at that time,

00:35:32.770 --> 00:35:34.690 align:middle line:84%
but I was also, in
some ways, scaling down

00:35:34.690 --> 00:35:37.120 align:middle line:84%
my own sort of
mental development.

00:35:37.120 --> 00:35:38.770 align:middle line:84%
And that was Chiron,
I have Chiron

00:35:38.770 --> 00:35:42.350 align:middle line:84%
in Aquarius, third house,
Gemini, elementary school,

00:35:42.350 --> 00:35:43.600 align:middle line:90%
schooling, and all that stuff.

00:35:43.600 --> 00:35:48.060 align:middle line:84%
And so I was ashamed, in
some ways, of my intellect,

00:35:48.060 --> 00:35:50.830 align:middle line:84%
or what I was able to at least
perceive as my intellect,

00:35:50.830 --> 00:35:54.150 align:middle line:84%
with my family and in a public
setting, I shut it down.

00:35:54.150 --> 00:35:57.300 align:middle line:84%
So we all have our pieces
of Chiron in our chart,

00:35:57.300 --> 00:35:58.930 align:middle line:84%
and it's important
to understand that.

00:35:58.930 --> 00:35:59.429 align:middle line:90%
Why?

00:35:59.429 --> 00:36:03.050 align:middle line:84%
Because Chiron is the point of
authentic access in the chart.

00:36:03.050 --> 00:36:05.380 align:middle line:84%
And once you're able to
own it, and once you're

00:36:05.380 --> 00:36:07.610 align:middle line:84%
able to bring it
home, then you have

00:36:07.610 --> 00:36:10.750 align:middle line:84%
done some really profound
work and some really deep

00:36:10.750 --> 00:36:11.970 align:middle line:90%
integration.

00:36:11.970 --> 00:36:14.840 align:middle line:84%
Understand and embrace
your own uniqueness,

00:36:14.840 --> 00:36:16.820 align:middle line:90%
because that's what Chiron does.

00:36:16.820 --> 00:36:20.200 align:middle line:84%
Chiron, while it is the
repository of shame,

00:36:20.200 --> 00:36:23.240 align:middle line:84%
is also the key to
your own authenticity.

00:36:23.240 --> 00:36:27.121 align:middle line:84%
So find out where Chiron is,
bring it home, and own it.

00:36:27.121 --> 00:36:28.280 align:middle line:90%
The True Node.

00:36:28.280 --> 00:36:31.070 align:middle line:84%
I am a big True Node
guy because I've

00:36:31.070 --> 00:36:32.790 align:middle line:90%
seen it work in my own life.

00:36:32.790 --> 00:36:34.650 align:middle line:84%
And I've seen it where
I have done things

00:36:34.650 --> 00:36:36.560 align:middle line:84%
outside of the realm
of my True Node,

00:36:36.560 --> 00:36:39.710 align:middle line:84%
and I've not really done
really well or very well

00:36:39.710 --> 00:36:40.970 align:middle line:90%
as a result of that.

00:36:40.970 --> 00:36:43.450 align:middle line:84%
I use this image because
the True Node is also

00:36:43.450 --> 00:36:45.180 align:middle line:90%
known as the dragon's head.

00:36:45.180 --> 00:36:49.490 align:middle line:84%
And so we talk about the
True Node or the North Node,

00:36:49.490 --> 00:36:51.870 align:middle line:84%
and then the South Node
is the dragon's tail.

00:36:51.870 --> 00:36:54.930 align:middle line:84%
Now, the dragon's
tail is, again, it's

00:36:54.930 --> 00:36:57.070 align:middle line:84%
kind of an area where
we feel vulnerable,

00:36:57.070 --> 00:37:00.380 align:middle line:84%
where parts of our lives
really don't work quite well.

00:37:00.380 --> 00:37:06.916 align:middle line:84%
And sort of the modern
astrological vector

00:37:06.916 --> 00:37:10.490 align:middle line:84%
for the nodes is to move towards
the North Node or the True Node

00:37:10.490 --> 00:37:11.730 align:middle line:90%
and away from the South Node.

00:37:11.730 --> 00:37:17.010 align:middle line:84%
Now, there can be a case made
that integrating the South Node

00:37:17.010 --> 00:37:20.870 align:middle line:84%
can be quite important to the
development of the individual.

00:37:20.870 --> 00:37:23.530 align:middle line:84%
But I think if we place our
energy on the North Node, what

00:37:23.530 --> 00:37:26.220 align:middle line:84%
we're going to do-- and
the True Node-- they're

00:37:26.220 --> 00:37:29.350 align:middle line:84%
very close together-- but
if we do that, what we'll do

00:37:29.350 --> 00:37:30.820 align:middle line:90%
is we'll find our True North.

00:37:30.820 --> 00:37:33.590 align:middle line:84%
We'll find the pole
star for our chart.

00:37:33.590 --> 00:37:35.940 align:middle line:84%
And if we follow
it, then we will

00:37:35.940 --> 00:37:38.650 align:middle line:84%
be rewarded by
essentially coming

00:37:38.650 --> 00:37:40.517 align:middle line:90%
in contact with our destiny.

00:37:40.517 --> 00:37:42.600 align:middle line:84%
So you've got to find out
where your True Node is.

00:37:42.600 --> 00:37:45.880 align:middle line:84%
It's really important,
very, very important.

00:37:45.880 --> 00:37:49.320 align:middle line:84%
And then you want to, with
as much courage and passion

00:37:49.320 --> 00:37:51.440 align:middle line:84%
and brio and all those
things, commitment,

00:37:51.440 --> 00:37:53.720 align:middle line:84%
that you bring to
the table, go to it.

00:37:53.720 --> 00:37:56.550 align:middle line:84%
Go to it, and then access
it, and tap into it.

00:37:56.550 --> 00:37:59.360 align:middle line:84%
The most challenging True
Node is the twelfth house,

00:37:59.360 --> 00:38:01.270 align:middle line:84%
because that takes you
away from the world.

00:38:01.270 --> 00:38:06.710 align:middle line:84%
And we live in a world where
we have been inculcated,

00:38:06.710 --> 00:38:09.680 align:middle line:84%
and we've been conditioned
to be in the world,

00:38:09.680 --> 00:38:13.022 align:middle line:84%
to be successful, to achieve,
to climb, to have the big bank

00:38:13.022 --> 00:38:14.480 align:middle line:84%
account, whatever
those things are,

00:38:14.480 --> 00:38:16.700 align:middle line:84%
whatever those markers
are for every individual.

00:38:16.700 --> 00:38:19.580 align:middle line:84%
But the True Node in
the twelfth house,

00:38:19.580 --> 00:38:20.965 align:middle line:90%
it has nothing to do with that.

00:38:20.965 --> 00:38:23.200 align:middle line:84%
In fact, it has nothing
to do this world at all.

00:38:23.200 --> 00:38:26.406 align:middle line:84%
So your challenge,
or your chart,

00:38:26.406 --> 00:38:28.680 align:middle line:84%
your navigational
point of destiny

00:38:28.680 --> 00:38:31.370 align:middle line:84%
is to go deeply into
meditation, to go deeply

00:38:31.370 --> 00:38:34.530 align:middle line:84%
into spending time with
yourself, to understanding

00:38:34.530 --> 00:38:36.350 align:middle line:84%
the quality and the
nature of your soul.

00:38:36.350 --> 00:38:38.360 align:middle line:84%
Your South Node would
be in the sixth house.

00:38:38.360 --> 00:38:40.450 align:middle line:84%
So there would be a lot
of people tapping on you,

00:38:40.450 --> 00:38:42.930 align:middle line:84%
wanting you to do
things for them.

00:38:42.930 --> 00:38:45.610 align:middle line:84%
And the fallback would
be to serve and to serve

00:38:45.610 --> 00:38:48.940 align:middle line:84%
in ways that aren't necessarily
in your own best interest,

00:38:48.940 --> 00:38:50.800 align:middle line:84%
dispersing your power,
dispersing your will,

00:38:50.800 --> 00:38:52.104 align:middle line:90%
dispersing your energy.

00:38:52.104 --> 00:38:54.020 align:middle line:84%
And what you really want
to do is take that up

00:38:54.020 --> 00:38:55.190 align:middle line:90%
into the twelfth house.

00:38:55.190 --> 00:38:56.982 align:middle line:84%
And you want to spend
time with yourself,

00:38:56.982 --> 00:38:59.440 align:middle line:84%
and your higher self, and all
your multidimensional selves,

00:38:59.440 --> 00:39:00.590 align:middle line:90%
and all that stuff.

00:39:00.590 --> 00:39:02.240 align:middle line:84%
So the True Node is
really important.

00:39:02.240 --> 00:39:04.260 align:middle line:84%
Go find it in your
chart and make it

00:39:04.260 --> 00:39:07.610 align:middle line:84%
a point to travel there, and
stay there, and hang out there.

00:39:07.610 --> 00:39:09.570 align:middle line:84%
Now, what I did is I
punched up my chart

00:39:09.570 --> 00:39:12.470 align:middle line:84%
just so you can-- give
you an example of the True

00:39:12.470 --> 00:39:14.100 align:middle line:90%
Node in action.

00:39:14.100 --> 00:39:17.500 align:middle line:84%
Here is my True Node, and it's
right here on the mid-heaven.

00:39:17.500 --> 00:39:20.360 align:middle line:84%
And the mid-heaven is the point
of contact with the world.

00:39:20.360 --> 00:39:24.260 align:middle line:84%
The tenth house is generally
considered the house

00:39:24.260 --> 00:39:28.160 align:middle line:84%
where we come in contact
with culture, commerce.

00:39:28.160 --> 00:39:29.970 align:middle line:90%
It's the world stage.

00:39:29.970 --> 00:39:32.810 align:middle line:84%
People that have planets
in the tenth house,

00:39:32.810 --> 00:39:36.820 align:middle line:84%
especially planets like
the Moon or the Sun,

00:39:36.820 --> 00:39:38.750 align:middle line:84%
they're generally
people that have

00:39:38.750 --> 00:39:42.584 align:middle line:84%
some form of public standing
or people know who they are.

00:39:42.584 --> 00:39:44.250 align:middle line:84%
And so here's my sun
in the tenth house,

00:39:44.250 --> 00:39:45.833 align:middle line:84%
and here I am in
front of this camera.

00:39:45.833 --> 00:39:48.024 align:middle line:84%
I'm kind of living out my
tenth house sun moment.

00:39:48.024 --> 00:39:49.940 align:middle line:84%
But it's the True Node
that's really important

00:39:49.940 --> 00:39:51.320 align:middle line:90%
because it's in Virgo.

00:39:51.320 --> 00:39:54.600 align:middle line:84%
And it's in the sign of
Virgo, which is service.

00:39:54.600 --> 00:39:57.740 align:middle line:84%
So I am here with the True Node,
the True North of my chart,

00:39:57.740 --> 00:39:59.984 align:middle line:84%
to bring some message
of service and helping

00:39:59.984 --> 00:40:01.650 align:middle line:84%
people to the world,
which I am actually

00:40:01.650 --> 00:40:02.691 align:middle line:90%
doing right here and now.

00:40:02.691 --> 00:40:04.440 align:middle line:90%
I am living my True Node.

00:40:04.440 --> 00:40:08.680 align:middle line:84%
And it took me a long time
to live that True Node,

00:40:08.680 --> 00:40:09.890 align:middle line:90%
to get to that point.

00:40:09.890 --> 00:40:13.400 align:middle line:84%
Because wherever it is in
the chart, wherever it is,

00:40:13.400 --> 00:40:15.620 align:middle line:84%
there's going to be, A,
the South Node, number one.

00:40:15.620 --> 00:40:17.370 align:middle line:84%
But there's also going
to be distractions.

00:40:17.370 --> 00:40:19.940 align:middle line:84%
There's also going to
be other pieces, which

00:40:19.940 --> 00:40:20.860 align:middle line:90%
will take you away.

00:40:20.860 --> 00:40:22.320 align:middle line:84%
And for the longest
time, I thought

00:40:22.320 --> 00:40:26.810 align:middle line:84%
I was here to help other
people, in some ways,

00:40:26.810 --> 00:40:28.240 align:middle line:90%
find their own destiny.

00:40:28.240 --> 00:40:31.230 align:middle line:84%
And yes, I'm doing
that to some extent.

00:40:31.230 --> 00:40:34.300 align:middle line:84%
But I was engaged in working
with musicians and artists

00:40:34.300 --> 00:40:35.870 align:middle line:90%
and trying to help promote them.

00:40:35.870 --> 00:40:38.280 align:middle line:84%
And I was OK at it, but
it was always about them.

00:40:38.280 --> 00:40:39.825 align:middle line:90%
It was about their life.

00:40:39.825 --> 00:40:43.027 align:middle line:84%
It was about their
peace, and their mission,

00:40:43.027 --> 00:40:43.860 align:middle line:90%
and their True Node.

00:40:43.860 --> 00:40:44.901 align:middle line:90%
But it wasn't about mine.

00:40:44.901 --> 00:40:47.270 align:middle line:84%
And when I finally
said, OK, I'm going

00:40:47.270 --> 00:40:50.590 align:middle line:84%
to focus on this part
of my life, that's

00:40:50.590 --> 00:40:55.390 align:middle line:84%
when the True Node lit
up for me and became

00:40:55.390 --> 00:40:58.850 align:middle line:84%
a potent point of
expression in my chart.

00:40:58.850 --> 00:41:03.010 align:middle line:84%
And I think anybody can tap into
their True Node and follow it.

00:41:03.010 --> 00:41:06.809 align:middle line:84%
And you can find where it
is you're supposed to be

00:41:06.809 --> 00:41:08.350 align:middle line:84%
and what you're
supposed to be doing.

00:41:08.350 --> 00:41:09.750 align:middle line:90%
It's not that hard.

00:41:09.750 --> 00:41:13.010 align:middle line:84%
All it takes is courage
and a willingness

00:41:13.010 --> 00:41:15.070 align:middle line:84%
to take the steps
in order to do that.

00:41:15.070 --> 00:41:17.620 align:middle line:84%
Now, real quick, my
South Node is down here

00:41:17.620 --> 00:41:20.870 align:middle line:84%
in the sign of Pisces, and
it's in the fourth house.

00:41:20.870 --> 00:41:25.680 align:middle line:84%
And as a result of that, I have
challenges, Piscean challenges,

00:41:25.680 --> 00:41:27.430 align:middle line:90%
with my family at times.

00:41:27.430 --> 00:41:30.270 align:middle line:84%
And I will give you
some interesting touch

00:41:30.270 --> 00:41:34.480 align:middle line:84%
points here just to show
you how astrology works.

00:41:34.480 --> 00:41:36.790 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to peel
back and unveil

00:41:36.790 --> 00:41:39.910 align:middle line:84%
just a small piece
of my personal life.

00:41:39.910 --> 00:41:45.800 align:middle line:84%
In 2009, I got a divorce,
and I left my house.

00:41:45.800 --> 00:41:51.230 align:middle line:84%
And it was right around
the 6th of March,

00:41:51.230 --> 00:41:53.070 align:middle line:84%
which is right where
my South Node is.

00:41:53.070 --> 00:41:53.570 align:middle line:90%
All right?

00:41:53.570 --> 00:41:54.445 align:middle line:90%
So keep that in mind.

00:41:54.445 --> 00:41:59.850 align:middle line:84%
Family-- I'm having a South
Node experience in 2009.

00:41:59.850 --> 00:42:04.710 align:middle line:84%
In 2010, almost to the day
a year later, my father

00:42:04.710 --> 00:42:06.030 align:middle line:90%
passes away.

00:42:06.030 --> 00:42:09.740 align:middle line:84%
Again, South Node experience,
the fourth house, Pisces,

00:42:09.740 --> 00:42:10.800 align:middle line:90%
family.

00:42:10.800 --> 00:42:16.550 align:middle line:84%
And just last week,
on the 7th of March,

00:42:16.550 --> 00:42:19.730 align:middle line:84%
again, down here
in my South Node,

00:42:19.730 --> 00:42:23.200 align:middle line:84%
I signed some papers
that have really

00:42:23.200 --> 00:42:25.780 align:middle line:84%
helped clarify and
articulate some things

00:42:25.780 --> 00:42:28.510 align:middle line:84%
with my ex-wife and my child
and all kinds of stuff,

00:42:28.510 --> 00:42:30.100 align:middle line:90%
really positive things.

00:42:30.100 --> 00:42:34.180 align:middle line:84%
But it went through a fairly
intense, fairly turgid,

00:42:34.180 --> 00:42:41.200 align:middle line:84%
and pretty emotional
sort of trial for me.

00:42:41.200 --> 00:42:42.450 align:middle line:90%
And when did it take place?

00:42:42.450 --> 00:42:44.940 align:middle line:84%
The same time that
I left the house

00:42:44.940 --> 00:42:47.910 align:middle line:84%
and went through the divorce,
the same time my father died.

00:42:47.910 --> 00:42:50.290 align:middle line:90%
Again, all South Node stuff.

00:42:50.290 --> 00:42:52.320 align:middle line:84%
So I'm just sharing
this with you

00:42:52.320 --> 00:42:57.370 align:middle line:84%
because it shows that there
is a unique and divine timing

00:42:57.370 --> 00:43:00.600 align:middle line:84%
to astrology, which you can
pluck out again and again

00:43:00.600 --> 00:43:01.390 align:middle line:90%
and again.

00:43:01.390 --> 00:43:04.330 align:middle line:84%
And every one of those
times, what happened was

00:43:04.330 --> 00:43:07.250 align:middle line:84%
is that it freed me up to
do more with my North Node

00:43:07.250 --> 00:43:08.580 align:middle line:90%
in my own way.

00:43:08.580 --> 00:43:11.040 align:middle line:84%
So we have to go through
the South Node at times,

00:43:11.040 --> 00:43:13.150 align:middle line:84%
but ultimately and
hopefully, it allows

00:43:13.150 --> 00:43:16.227 align:middle line:84%
us to go deeper and further with
our North Node or True Node.

00:43:16.227 --> 00:43:17.310 align:middle line:90%
Where does it all take us?

00:43:17.310 --> 00:43:18.910 align:middle line:90%
Where does it all take you?

00:43:18.910 --> 00:43:20.110 align:middle line:90%
I love this image.

00:43:20.110 --> 00:43:21.420 align:middle line:90%
This is called "Glad Day."

00:43:21.420 --> 00:43:22.390 align:middle line:90%
It's by William Blake.

00:43:22.390 --> 00:43:24.100 align:middle line:90%
And to me, it is innocence.

00:43:24.100 --> 00:43:24.850 align:middle line:90%
It is imagination.

00:43:24.850 --> 00:43:27.360 align:middle line:90%
It is freedom.

00:43:27.360 --> 00:43:34.800 align:middle line:84%
It is living life in unabashedly
joyous and authentic terms.

00:43:34.800 --> 00:43:37.827 align:middle line:84%
And hopefully,
hopefully, if you can

00:43:37.827 --> 00:43:39.410 align:middle line:84%
work with some of
the things that I've

00:43:39.410 --> 00:43:42.330 align:middle line:84%
shared with you today, and you
can find some of those pieces

00:43:42.330 --> 00:43:44.130 align:middle line:84%
like being inventive,
and compassionate,

00:43:44.130 --> 00:43:48.190 align:middle line:84%
and enduring, hopefully, you
can put them all together,

00:43:48.190 --> 00:43:53.150 align:middle line:84%
and you can, and we can,
get to this point together.

00:43:53.150 --> 00:43:57.600 align:middle line:84%
We can all live from this
radiant, and vulnerable,

00:43:57.600 --> 00:44:02.249 align:middle line:84%
and open, and joyous personal
and collective being.

00:44:02.249 --> 00:44:03.790 align:middle line:84%
So I want to thank
you for joining me

00:44:03.790 --> 00:44:08.330 align:middle line:84%
on this edition of "The Eleventh
House," the astrology of you.

00:44:08.330 --> 00:44:11.480 align:middle line:84%
And hopefully, you've picked
up a few things along the way

00:44:11.480 --> 00:44:15.840 align:middle line:84%
so that we can all get to
that "Glad Day" place together

00:44:15.840 --> 00:44:17.380 align:middle line:90%
at some point in time.

00:44:17.380 --> 00:44:19.700 align:middle line:84%
So until the next time,
this is Robert Phoenix,

00:44:19.700 --> 00:44:22.550 align:middle line:90%
and may the stars be with you.

00:44:22.550 --> 00:44:24.100 align:middle line:90%
