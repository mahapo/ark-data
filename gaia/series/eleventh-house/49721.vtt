00:00:17.526 --> 00:00:18.650 align:middle line:90%
>>ROBERT PHOENIX: Hi there.

00:00:18.650 --> 00:00:20.210 align:middle line:10%
I'm Robert Phoenix and
welcome to another edition

00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:20.915 align:middle line:10%
of "The Eleventh House."

00:00:20.915 --> 00:00:22.373 align:middle line:10%
And today we're
going to be looking

00:00:22.373 --> 00:00:26.730 align:middle line:10%
at the astrology of the
very first atomic bomb, that

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:31.260 align:middle line:10%
is the atomic bomb that was
blown up at White Sands, New

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:33.970 align:middle line:10%
Mexico, the Alamogordo facility.

00:00:33.970 --> 00:00:37.200 align:middle line:84%
The atomic bomb,
known as Trinity,

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:40.170 align:middle line:84%
and named such by
Robert Oppenheimer.

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:43.500 align:middle line:84%
We're going to be looking at
the astrology of that day, how

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:48.770 align:middle line:84%
that bomb affected this country
and the chart of this country.

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:51.440 align:middle line:84%
We'll also be looking at
Robert Oppenheimer's chart,

00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:54.370 align:middle line:84%
and we're going to be getting
into this whole concept

00:00:54.370 --> 00:00:57.440 align:middle line:84%
of the Manhattan
Project and also

00:00:57.440 --> 00:01:02.190 align:middle line:84%
the atomic explosions at
Hiroshima and Nagasaki.

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:06.380 align:middle line:84%
And we'll also be exploring
the mystery of the 33rd degree

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:11.270 align:middle line:84%
parallel, which plays
into this as well.

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:15.900 align:middle line:84%
So let's get into the
astrology of the atomic bomb.

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:18.260 align:middle line:90%
So here we have Trinity.

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:21.191 align:middle line:84%
And Trinity took
place in-- let me just

00:01:21.191 --> 00:01:22.690 align:middle line:84%
get to the-- Well,
first of all, let

00:01:22.690 --> 00:01:24.620 align:middle line:84%
me just tell you
where it took place.

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:27.320 align:middle line:90%
It took place at 33 degrees.

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:30.235 align:middle line:84%
This is a really important
number because there's a line,

00:01:30.235 --> 00:01:32.510 align:middle line:84%
it's the 33rd degree
parallel line,

00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:34.260 align:middle line:84%
that runs all the way
around the planet.

00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:36.580 align:middle line:84%
It's not just in
the United States,

00:01:36.580 --> 00:01:40.360 align:middle line:84%
but it also goes to Japan,
as we'll see, and places

00:01:40.360 --> 00:01:47.090 align:middle line:84%
like Syria and Libya and Israel,
and other very interesting

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:48.380 align:middle line:90%
destinations along the way.

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:50.460 align:middle line:90%
Phoenicia and Memphis.

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:54.090 align:middle line:84%
We're talking Memphis,
United States, not Egypt.

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:58.130 align:middle line:84%
So 33 degrees, Trinity,
the first atomic bomb.

00:01:58.130 --> 00:02:05.240 align:middle line:84%
Now, it took place on Monday,
the 16th of July, 1945.

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:08.410 align:middle line:90%
And it was at 5:29 AM.

00:02:08.410 --> 00:02:12.010 align:middle line:90%
The universal time is 11:29.

00:02:12.010 --> 00:02:15.790 align:middle line:84%
If you add 11:29 together,
it's two plus 9 is 11,

00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:17.762 align:middle line:90%
and you have 11, so you have 22.

00:02:17.762 --> 00:02:18.720 align:middle line:90%
That's a master number.

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:21.760 align:middle line:84%
That master number will come
up just a little bit later.

00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:26.570 align:middle line:84%
So this is what the sky looked
like when the bomb went off.

00:02:26.570 --> 00:02:32.550 align:middle line:84%
Now, the United States is a
Cancer country, born July 5,

00:02:32.550 --> 00:02:33.350 align:middle line:90%
theoretically.

00:02:33.350 --> 00:02:35.930 align:middle line:84%
There's a number of
interpretations, by the way,

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:37.930 align:middle line:84%
of the chart for
the United States.

00:02:37.930 --> 00:02:41.160 align:middle line:84%
Some people use Gemini rising
for the chart of the United

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:41.660 align:middle line:90%
States.

00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:45.350 align:middle line:84%
I use the Sibley chart,
which has Sagittarius rising.

00:02:45.350 --> 00:02:51.970 align:middle line:84%
And the reason I use Sagittarius
rising as the chart for the US

00:02:51.970 --> 00:02:54.650 align:middle line:84%
is because the horses
play such an enormous role

00:02:54.650 --> 00:02:57.720 align:middle line:84%
in the formation of
the United States.

00:02:57.720 --> 00:03:02.360 align:middle line:84%
But also, Sagittarius
represents sports, and outdoors,

00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:04.860 align:middle line:90%
and adventure, and expansion.

00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:07.050 align:middle line:84%
And that's what this
country theoretically did.

00:03:07.050 --> 00:03:08.900 align:middle line:84%
It expanded westward,
although the country

00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:11.085 align:middle line:84%
existed before it
became a country.

00:03:11.085 --> 00:03:12.710 align:middle line:84%
It was just the
expansion of the people

00:03:12.710 --> 00:03:14.740 align:middle line:90%
that came here to this country.

00:03:14.740 --> 00:03:18.110 align:middle line:84%
And, of course, the
interests and the passion

00:03:18.110 --> 00:03:20.350 align:middle line:84%
and the focus on sports
is representative

00:03:20.350 --> 00:03:21.850 align:middle line:84%
of Sagittarius in
the First House.

00:03:21.850 --> 00:03:25.660 align:middle line:84%
So I'm a little bit partial to
the Sibley chart, which I use.

00:03:25.660 --> 00:03:28.410 align:middle line:84%
So here, with this
chart, this is

00:03:28.410 --> 00:03:33.070 align:middle line:84%
where the sun was at the
time the bomb went kaboom.

00:03:33.070 --> 00:03:35.060 align:middle line:84%
The ascendant was in
the sign of Cancer,

00:03:35.060 --> 00:03:40.370 align:middle line:84%
which again, represents the
country, the United States.

00:03:40.370 --> 00:03:43.110 align:middle line:84%
And what's interesting
is that currently we

00:03:43.110 --> 00:03:46.600 align:middle line:84%
have Jupiter in
the sign of Cancer.

00:03:46.600 --> 00:03:49.700 align:middle line:84%
And I'm betting, although
I think Jupiter is probably

00:03:49.700 --> 00:03:53.460 align:middle line:84%
right around 12,
11 degrees, we're

00:03:53.460 --> 00:03:55.200 align:middle line:90%
having this discussion today.

00:03:55.200 --> 00:04:00.690 align:middle line:84%
By the way, it's 3/11 and it's
the anniversary of Fukushima.

00:04:00.690 --> 00:04:01.840 align:middle line:90%
I don't plan these things.

00:04:01.840 --> 00:04:03.490 align:middle line:84%
They just kind of
happen this way.

00:04:03.490 --> 00:04:05.390 align:middle line:84%
So we're talking
about atomic energy

00:04:05.390 --> 00:04:08.450 align:middle line:84%
on 3/11, the anniversary
of Fukushima.

00:04:08.450 --> 00:04:10.955 align:middle line:84%
Jupiter's in Cancer,
and it's retrograde.

00:04:10.955 --> 00:04:11.830 align:middle line:90%
So what are we doing?

00:04:11.830 --> 00:04:13.820 align:middle line:90%
We're traveling back in time.

00:04:13.820 --> 00:04:17.089 align:middle line:84%
We're taking a
Jupitarian express

00:04:17.089 --> 00:04:19.510 align:middle line:90%
into the Trinity experience.

00:04:19.510 --> 00:04:23.180 align:middle line:84%
So we have the true node
here in the 12th house.

00:04:23.180 --> 00:04:25.195 align:middle line:84%
And we also have
Uranus in Aries--

00:04:25.195 --> 00:04:27.750 align:middle line:84%
I'm sorry, Gemini in
the 12th house as well.

00:04:27.750 --> 00:04:28.875 align:middle line:90%
What does Uranus represent?

00:04:28.875 --> 00:04:31.159 align:middle line:90%
It represents uranium.

00:04:31.159 --> 00:04:31.700 align:middle line:90%
That's right.

00:04:31.700 --> 00:04:35.590 align:middle line:84%
Uranium, which plays a
role in the production

00:04:35.590 --> 00:04:37.160 align:middle line:84%
of the atomic bomb
and, of course,

00:04:37.160 --> 00:04:39.220 align:middle line:84%
the explosion of
the atomic bomb.

00:04:39.220 --> 00:04:42.010 align:middle line:84%
So we have uranium here,
Uranus in the 12th house.

00:04:42.010 --> 00:04:43.320 align:middle line:90%
Gemini.

00:04:43.320 --> 00:04:45.530 align:middle line:84%
So there is, again,
with the 12th house

00:04:45.530 --> 00:04:46.940 align:middle line:90%
a real sense of mystery.

00:04:46.940 --> 00:04:49.160 align:middle line:90%
Like what's behind the curtain?

00:04:49.160 --> 00:04:50.490 align:middle line:90%
What's behind the veil?

00:04:50.490 --> 00:04:55.710 align:middle line:84%
What has sunken beneath the
surface of the 12th house?

00:04:55.710 --> 00:04:59.870 align:middle line:84%
And so we have this interesting
relationship between Venus

00:04:59.870 --> 00:05:03.210 align:middle line:84%
and the eleventh house, right
there on the cusp of the 12th,

00:05:03.210 --> 00:05:06.140 align:middle line:84%
and Uranus, which would
indicate that there

00:05:06.140 --> 00:05:09.190 align:middle line:84%
is some kind of group
effort involved here.

00:05:09.190 --> 00:05:11.990 align:middle line:84%
Because the eleventh
house represents groups.

00:05:11.990 --> 00:05:15.130 align:middle line:84%
And the Manhattan Project
was a group effort.

00:05:15.130 --> 00:05:19.710 align:middle line:84%
Nobody knew what was happening
with the Manhattan Project.

00:05:19.710 --> 00:05:23.630 align:middle line:84%
Everybody had their own
little task to fulfill,

00:05:23.630 --> 00:05:27.520 align:middle line:84%
but they really didn't
understand how that task

00:05:27.520 --> 00:05:30.050 align:middle line:84%
or how that mission or
how that problem would

00:05:30.050 --> 00:05:31.770 align:middle line:90%
fit into the greater whole.

00:05:31.770 --> 00:05:33.830 align:middle line:84%
That would be up to
Robert Oppenheimer whom

00:05:33.830 --> 00:05:36.760 align:middle line:84%
we're going to look at
in just a moment or two.

00:05:36.760 --> 00:05:38.370 align:middle line:84%
So here we have
the relationship,

00:05:38.370 --> 00:05:39.670 align:middle line:90%
the eleventh house.

00:05:39.670 --> 00:05:40.430 align:middle line:90%
The group effort.

00:05:40.430 --> 00:05:43.990 align:middle line:84%
There's Mars, there's Taurus
in the eleventh house as well.

00:05:43.990 --> 00:05:45.060 align:middle line:90%
Mars and Taurus.

00:05:45.060 --> 00:05:48.470 align:middle line:84%
And it manifests over here
in the mystery of the 12th.

00:05:48.470 --> 00:05:50.880 align:middle line:84%
The finished product
is in the house

00:05:50.880 --> 00:05:52.610 align:middle line:90%
of mystery, the 12th house.

00:05:52.610 --> 00:05:55.250 align:middle line:84%
And the true node
here is in Cancer.

00:05:55.250 --> 00:05:58.910 align:middle line:84%
And what's interesting
is is that theoretically

00:05:58.910 --> 00:06:04.545 align:middle line:84%
there should be some kind
of Cancerian sort of-- I

00:06:04.545 --> 00:06:06.170 align:middle line:84%
don't know, what's
the word I'm looking

00:06:06.170 --> 00:06:09.340 align:middle line:84%
for here-- a Cancerian kind
of application towards this.

00:06:09.340 --> 00:06:13.100 align:middle line:84%
Maybe it manifests in
x-rays or some other form

00:06:13.100 --> 00:06:17.040 align:middle line:84%
of nuclear medicine
as a result of this.

00:06:17.040 --> 00:06:20.830 align:middle line:84%
But certainly, it
is not necessarily

00:06:20.830 --> 00:06:23.950 align:middle line:84%
a nurturing energy,
the atomic bomb.

00:06:23.950 --> 00:06:26.370 align:middle line:84%
I don't necessarily
view it as nurturing.

00:06:26.370 --> 00:06:29.200 align:middle line:84%
However, we do
have the sun here,

00:06:29.200 --> 00:06:31.055 align:middle line:84%
and we're harnessing
the power of the sun.

00:06:31.055 --> 00:06:32.010 align:middle line:84%
Right, isn't that
what they're doing?

00:06:32.010 --> 00:06:34.950 align:middle line:84%
They're harnessing the power of
the sun with the atomic bomb,

00:06:34.950 --> 00:06:37.280 align:middle line:84%
and so the sun is
fairly prevalent.

00:06:37.280 --> 00:06:38.520 align:middle line:90%
13 degrees of senate.

00:06:38.520 --> 00:06:41.530 align:middle line:84%
There's Saturn right
there on the ascendant.

00:06:41.530 --> 00:06:42.450 align:middle line:90%
And Saturn is what?

00:06:42.450 --> 00:06:43.810 align:middle line:90%
Saturn is karma.

00:06:43.810 --> 00:06:48.700 align:middle line:84%
So there are karmic implications
of what's about to take place.

00:06:48.700 --> 00:06:50.990 align:middle line:84%
Keep that in mind:
karmic implications.

00:06:50.990 --> 00:06:53.531 align:middle line:84%
And we're going to get into this
towards the end of the show.

00:06:53.531 --> 00:06:54.950 align:middle line:90%
It's kind of interesting.

00:06:54.950 --> 00:06:57.610 align:middle line:84%
So here we have the sun and
Saturn on the ascendant.

00:06:57.610 --> 00:07:00.880 align:middle line:84%
And then down in the
second house there's Pluto.

00:07:00.880 --> 00:07:02.920 align:middle line:90%
And Pluto is in the sign of Leo.

00:07:02.920 --> 00:07:04.470 align:middle line:90%
It's at the ninth degree.

00:07:04.470 --> 00:07:06.100 align:middle line:90%
There's a lot of nines here.

00:07:06.100 --> 00:07:07.740 align:middle line:90%
Pluto, nine degrees, Leo.

00:07:07.740 --> 00:07:09.170 align:middle line:90%
True node nine degrees Cancer.

00:07:09.170 --> 00:07:11.460 align:middle line:90%
Venus nine degrees Gemini.

00:07:11.460 --> 00:07:14.110 align:middle line:90%
And so the number nine shows up.

00:07:14.110 --> 00:07:16.080 align:middle line:84%
Nine is the number of
the soul, by the way.

00:07:16.080 --> 00:07:19.780 align:middle line:84%
And then we have Mercury here
in Leo in the second house.

00:07:19.780 --> 00:07:21.360 align:middle line:84%
The second house
represents values.

00:07:21.360 --> 00:07:24.942 align:middle line:84%
It represents grounding,
the foundation.

00:07:24.942 --> 00:07:25.900 align:middle line:90%
And so what do we have?

00:07:25.900 --> 00:07:29.080 align:middle line:90%
We've got Pluto, plutonium.

00:07:29.080 --> 00:07:34.270 align:middle line:84%
And the power of the sun,
Leo, second house-- land,

00:07:34.270 --> 00:07:36.830 align:middle line:90%
White Sands, Taurus.

00:07:36.830 --> 00:07:38.180 align:middle line:90%
That's what's happening.

00:07:38.180 --> 00:07:39.720 align:middle line:90%
That's what's taking place.

00:07:39.720 --> 00:07:42.910 align:middle line:84%
And then we have a square
between Mercury and Mars,

00:07:42.910 --> 00:07:45.660 align:middle line:84%
and Mars, of course,
being representative

00:07:45.660 --> 00:07:48.530 align:middle line:84%
of the second house
in the sign of Taurus.

00:07:48.530 --> 00:07:50.320 align:middle line:84%
Then moving along
in the chart, we've

00:07:50.320 --> 00:07:52.050 align:middle line:90%
got Jupiter down here in Virgo.

00:07:52.050 --> 00:07:55.410 align:middle line:84%
And Chiron at the
29th degree of Virgo,

00:07:55.410 --> 00:07:59.340 align:middle line:84%
which happens to be my sun
sign-- kind of interesting.

00:07:59.340 --> 00:08:01.560 align:middle line:90%
So Chiron is at the edge.

00:08:01.560 --> 00:08:04.690 align:middle line:84%
It's almost at the
fourth house, on the cusp

00:08:04.690 --> 00:08:06.870 align:middle line:84%
of the fourth house--
the third and the

00:08:06.870 --> 00:08:09.560 align:middle line:84%
for-- we might even read
that for the-- in fact it is.

00:08:09.560 --> 00:08:12.201 align:middle line:90%
It's right on the IC.

00:08:12.201 --> 00:08:15.480 align:middle line:84%
So the fourth house is
the house of Cancer,

00:08:15.480 --> 00:08:16.690 align:middle line:90%
and it's the homeland, right.

00:08:16.690 --> 00:08:18.270 align:middle line:90%
It's the United States.

00:08:18.270 --> 00:08:21.110 align:middle line:84%
So here we have Chiron
coming in and getting

00:08:21.110 --> 00:08:25.330 align:middle line:84%
ready to afflict the
fourth house in some ways.

00:08:25.330 --> 00:08:27.851 align:middle line:84%
So this is an
interesting planet.

00:08:27.851 --> 00:08:28.350 align:middle line:90%
I'm sorry.

00:08:28.350 --> 00:08:29.308 align:middle line:90%
It's not even a planet.

00:08:29.308 --> 00:08:30.080 align:middle line:90%
It's an asteroid.

00:08:30.080 --> 00:08:32.950 align:middle line:84%
And it's in Virgo, so it has
something to do with what?

00:08:32.950 --> 00:08:34.210 align:middle line:90%
Health.

00:08:34.210 --> 00:08:35.080 align:middle line:90%
Health.

00:08:35.080 --> 00:08:38.270 align:middle line:84%
So perhaps, what
we're seeing here

00:08:38.270 --> 00:08:41.320 align:middle line:84%
as a result of the
explosion of Trinity

00:08:41.320 --> 00:08:44.980 align:middle line:90%
is the potential for what?

00:08:44.980 --> 00:08:46.290 align:middle line:90%
Cancer.

00:08:46.290 --> 00:08:50.940 align:middle line:84%
Perhaps cancer and the
rise of nuclear power,

00:08:50.940 --> 00:08:54.300 align:middle line:84%
the proliferation of
nuclear power plants

00:08:54.300 --> 00:08:57.920 align:middle line:84%
as it relates to the fourth
house, which is home.

00:08:57.920 --> 00:09:00.720 align:middle line:84%
Perhaps this Chiron in
Virgo at the 29th degree,

00:09:00.720 --> 00:09:05.020 align:middle line:84%
the anaretic degree is a
harbinger of what's to come.

00:09:05.020 --> 00:09:07.429 align:middle line:84%
We have Neptune here,
and we have the moon

00:09:07.429 --> 00:09:09.970 align:middle line:84%
in Libra, which I seem to have
been talking about quite a bit

00:09:09.970 --> 00:09:13.160 align:middle line:84%
today in other episodes, down
in the fourth house trying

00:09:13.160 --> 00:09:17.970 align:middle line:84%
to bring balance back
into the fourth house,

00:09:17.970 --> 00:09:23.060 align:middle line:84%
or back into the foundation
and the home of this chart.

00:09:23.060 --> 00:09:24.790 align:middle line:84%
It's kind of
interesting stuff here.

00:09:24.790 --> 00:09:27.060 align:middle line:90%
The mid-heaven is at 29.

00:09:27.060 --> 00:09:29.970 align:middle line:84%
So we're dealing with
anaretic degrees here, 29, 29.

00:09:29.970 --> 00:09:31.960 align:middle line:90%
In 13, the number 13.

00:09:31.960 --> 00:09:33.630 align:middle line:84%
What does the
number 13 represent?

00:09:33.630 --> 00:09:36.221 align:middle line:84%
It represents death,
in the major arcana.

00:09:36.221 --> 00:09:36.720 align:middle line:90%
Death.

00:09:36.720 --> 00:09:38.730 align:middle line:90%
That's the number 13.

00:09:38.730 --> 00:09:40.630 align:middle line:90%
Then over here, guess what?

00:09:40.630 --> 00:09:43.690 align:middle line:90%
We have 13 degrees Capricorn.

00:09:43.690 --> 00:09:46.080 align:middle line:90%
And where is Pluto?

00:09:46.080 --> 00:09:46.730 align:middle line:90%
You guessed it.

00:09:46.730 --> 00:09:50.330 align:middle line:84%
It's at 13 degrees
right now as we speak.

00:09:50.330 --> 00:09:53.800 align:middle line:84%
So we're having kind
of a Pluto return here

00:09:53.800 --> 00:09:56.464 align:middle line:84%
opposite Cancer
on the ascendant.

00:09:56.464 --> 00:09:57.380 align:middle line:90%
And what are we doing?

00:09:57.380 --> 00:09:59.830 align:middle line:84%
We're talking about
the atomic bomb.

00:09:59.830 --> 00:10:03.310 align:middle line:84%
You're having an archetypal
moment right now with me,

00:10:03.310 --> 00:10:07.310 align:middle line:84%
with Pluto over here, discussing
this and our relationship

00:10:07.310 --> 00:10:09.600 align:middle line:90%
to atomic energy.

00:10:09.600 --> 00:10:11.030 align:middle line:90%
There is a conflict.

00:10:11.030 --> 00:10:13.280 align:middle line:84%
Saturn is squaring
the moon here.

00:10:13.280 --> 00:10:18.270 align:middle line:84%
So there is a karmic impact
on this Saturn, Cancer, right?

00:10:18.270 --> 00:10:21.860 align:middle line:84%
And moon in the fourth house,
also in Cancer as well.

00:10:21.860 --> 00:10:24.745 align:middle line:84%
We're going to have to
balance this out some day.

00:10:24.745 --> 00:10:27.380 align:middle line:84%
And perhaps someday
soon with Pluto now

00:10:27.380 --> 00:10:29.230 align:middle line:90%
moving into the seventh house.

00:10:29.230 --> 00:10:33.440 align:middle line:84%
And at some point, and
it will be in 2015,

00:10:33.440 --> 00:10:38.400 align:middle line:84%
transiting Pluto will
oppose this Saturn

00:10:38.400 --> 00:10:40.990 align:middle line:90%
in Cancer 15 degrees.

00:10:40.990 --> 00:10:43.810 align:middle line:84%
So we're going to have
a reckoning of sorts

00:10:43.810 --> 00:10:47.970 align:middle line:84%
in this house of relationship
with Pluto plutonium

00:10:47.970 --> 00:10:49.150 align:middle line:90%
and this event.

00:10:49.150 --> 00:10:52.101 align:middle line:90%
And it'll happen in 2015.

00:10:52.101 --> 00:10:53.600 align:middle line:84%
And, again, we're
dealing with what?

00:10:53.600 --> 00:10:55.390 align:middle line:90%
The 15th degree.

00:10:55.390 --> 00:10:56.520 align:middle line:90%
Interesting stuff.

00:10:56.520 --> 00:10:57.300 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:10:57.300 --> 00:10:59.980 align:middle line:90%
So let's move on here.

00:10:59.980 --> 00:11:02.660 align:middle line:84%
This is the USA chart,
the chart of the USA,

00:11:02.660 --> 00:11:04.580 align:middle line:90%
and the Trinity chart.

00:11:04.580 --> 00:11:07.420 align:middle line:84%
I put them together just to
see what we could come up with,

00:11:07.420 --> 00:11:09.530 align:middle line:84%
and the results are
pretty interesting.

00:11:09.530 --> 00:11:11.960 align:middle line:84%
The United States chart
is in the inside ring.

00:11:11.960 --> 00:11:13.840 align:middle line:84%
You can see the
ascendant and then

00:11:13.840 --> 00:11:15.090 align:middle line:90%
they're Sagittarius over here.

00:11:15.090 --> 00:11:16.830 align:middle line:90%
I'm using the Sibley chart.

00:11:16.830 --> 00:11:20.385 align:middle line:84%
And then there's a
fairly solid congregation

00:11:20.385 --> 00:11:23.830 align:middle line:84%
of planets over in this part
of the chart of the sixth,

00:11:23.830 --> 00:11:25.440 align:middle line:90%
the seventh, the eighth house.

00:11:25.440 --> 00:11:27.970 align:middle line:84%
So we're talking,
really, the end

00:11:27.970 --> 00:11:29.880 align:middle line:84%
of the second quadrant
and the beginning

00:11:29.880 --> 00:11:31.940 align:middle line:84%
of the third quadrant
of the chart.

00:11:31.940 --> 00:11:36.330 align:middle line:84%
And here we can see
some interesting pieces

00:11:36.330 --> 00:11:37.810 align:middle line:90%
come into play.

00:11:37.810 --> 00:11:41.410 align:middle line:84%
So we've got Uranus
here in the sixth house

00:11:41.410 --> 00:11:43.430 align:middle line:90%
of the United States' chart.

00:11:43.430 --> 00:11:46.500 align:middle line:84%
We've already determined the
Uranus represents uranium

00:11:46.500 --> 00:11:48.260 align:middle line:90%
and it represents instability.

00:11:48.260 --> 00:11:52.850 align:middle line:84%
It represents the explosive
power of change via Uranus

00:11:52.850 --> 00:11:54.600 align:middle line:90%
in the sign of Aquarius.

00:11:54.600 --> 00:11:55.850 align:middle line:90%
And here's Venus.

00:11:55.850 --> 00:11:57.680 align:middle line:90%
Uranus in Gemini.

00:11:57.680 --> 00:11:59.230 align:middle line:90%
Here's Venus in Gemini.

00:11:59.230 --> 00:11:59.960 align:middle line:90%
And guess what?

00:11:59.960 --> 00:12:00.720 align:middle line:90%
Oh yeah.

00:12:00.720 --> 00:12:03.300 align:middle line:84%
Uranus was also in
Gemini at the time

00:12:03.300 --> 00:12:07.040 align:middle line:84%
that the bomb went
off in New Mexico.

00:12:07.040 --> 00:12:10.340 align:middle line:84%
So we have a Uranus,
Uranus-- almost a conjunction

00:12:10.340 --> 00:12:11.460 align:middle line:90%
at that time.

00:12:11.460 --> 00:12:14.800 align:middle line:84%
But what happened was is
that we were beginning

00:12:14.800 --> 00:12:20.370 align:middle line:84%
to establish Venus, our
relationship with Uranian

00:12:20.370 --> 00:12:22.809 align:middle line:90%
energy and the atomic bomb.

00:12:22.809 --> 00:12:23.850 align:middle line:90%
That happens right there.

00:12:23.850 --> 00:12:25.890 align:middle line:90%
You can see the conjunction.

00:12:25.890 --> 00:12:31.630 align:middle line:84%
And as a result, we have to
again understand and diagnose

00:12:31.630 --> 00:12:36.830 align:middle line:84%
what the long-term consequences
of that relationship are,

00:12:36.830 --> 00:12:38.720 align:middle line:84%
because Uranus is
in the sixth house

00:12:38.720 --> 00:12:42.390 align:middle line:84%
here in the United States'
chart of health and healing.

00:12:42.390 --> 00:12:44.430 align:middle line:84%
Here it's moved into
the seventh and we now

00:12:44.430 --> 00:12:49.240 align:middle line:84%
have a full-blown
relationship with uranium.

00:12:49.240 --> 00:12:55.520 align:middle line:84%
The true node at that time when
the bomb went off in New Mexico

00:12:55.520 --> 00:12:56.490 align:middle line:90%
is in between.

00:12:56.490 --> 00:13:00.340 align:middle line:84%
It's the midpoint between
the sun and Venus.

00:13:00.340 --> 00:13:04.850 align:middle line:84%
So we're going to understand,
in some ways, our destiny

00:13:04.850 --> 00:13:09.020 align:middle line:84%
and our future
history as a country,

00:13:09.020 --> 00:13:11.130 align:middle line:84%
and even as a
planet in some ways,

00:13:11.130 --> 00:13:15.430 align:middle line:84%
as a result of this
action and this activity.

00:13:15.430 --> 00:13:17.380 align:middle line:84%
And we're dealing with
a lot of Cancerian

00:13:17.380 --> 00:13:19.680 align:middle line:90%
and a lot of lunar energy.

00:13:19.680 --> 00:13:21.765 align:middle line:84%
And when we play
with lunar energy

00:13:21.765 --> 00:13:25.830 align:middle line:84%
or we play with the
whole notion of the moon,

00:13:25.830 --> 00:13:26.880 align:middle line:90%
it's not always clear.

00:13:26.880 --> 00:13:29.570 align:middle line:84%
It's not like the
sun where it's bright

00:13:29.570 --> 00:13:33.170 align:middle line:84%
and we can see where we're going
and our shadows are illuminated

00:13:33.170 --> 00:13:35.450 align:middle line:90%
by the light of the sun.

00:13:35.450 --> 00:13:37.220 align:middle line:90%
The moon is quite different.

00:13:37.220 --> 00:13:41.070 align:middle line:84%
The moon often takes place
in shadow and darkness,

00:13:41.070 --> 00:13:43.920 align:middle line:84%
whether it's the full moon
or quarter moon or even

00:13:43.920 --> 00:13:44.850 align:middle line:90%
a new moon.

00:13:44.850 --> 00:13:48.390 align:middle line:84%
So we're in a realm where
we're dealing with instinct.

00:13:48.390 --> 00:13:49.600 align:middle line:90%
We're dealing with intuition.

00:13:49.600 --> 00:13:51.940 align:middle line:84%
In some cases, we're even
dealing with madness.

00:13:51.940 --> 00:13:54.190 align:middle line:84%
So there's a lot of
lunar energy that's

00:13:54.190 --> 00:13:57.370 align:middle line:90%
been evoked by this event.

00:13:57.370 --> 00:14:00.780 align:middle line:84%
And here again we
can see that Saturn

00:14:00.780 --> 00:14:03.450 align:middle line:90%
is almost right on the US sun.

00:14:03.450 --> 00:14:08.370 align:middle line:84%
So we have a karmic
relationship with this energy

00:14:08.370 --> 00:14:11.110 align:middle line:84%
and with this event,
which obviously,

00:14:11.110 --> 00:14:12.890 align:middle line:84%
and we just talked
about, as a result

00:14:12.890 --> 00:14:15.970 align:middle line:84%
of the Pluto-Saturn
opposition, which is coming up.

00:14:15.970 --> 00:14:19.300 align:middle line:84%
And here we have the sun
in Cancer conjuncting

00:14:19.300 --> 00:14:23.240 align:middle line:84%
the United States'
Mercury in Cancer as well.

00:14:23.240 --> 00:14:28.130 align:middle line:84%
So we are able to-- this
event not only impacted

00:14:28.130 --> 00:14:32.520 align:middle line:84%
us karmically, but it
impacted how we communicate.

00:14:32.520 --> 00:14:36.080 align:middle line:84%
And in some ways, I
think that the explosion

00:14:36.080 --> 00:14:38.330 align:middle line:84%
of the atomic bomb, because
what we're looking at here

00:14:38.330 --> 00:14:40.370 align:middle line:84%
is Mercury in the
eighth house, which

00:14:40.370 --> 00:14:42.280 align:middle line:84%
is the house of the
subconscious, the house

00:14:42.280 --> 00:14:45.510 align:middle line:84%
of death-- the house of
death, sex, transformation,

00:14:45.510 --> 00:14:47.340 align:middle line:90%
Hades, the underworld.

00:14:47.340 --> 00:14:49.730 align:middle line:84%
And I think that what
the atomic bomb did,

00:14:49.730 --> 00:14:53.120 align:middle line:84%
or what this explosion did
is it activated that Mercury.

00:14:53.120 --> 00:14:57.700 align:middle line:84%
And as a result, we had this
explosion of psychic material

00:14:57.700 --> 00:15:01.590 align:middle line:84%
that erupted in the 20th
century with psychotherapy,

00:15:01.590 --> 00:15:05.500 align:middle line:84%
with cinema, with
art, with novels.

00:15:05.500 --> 00:15:11.440 align:middle line:84%
And the psyche, the revelation,
explication of the psyche,

00:15:11.440 --> 00:15:15.440 align:middle line:84%
and making the psyche
known to the nature of man

00:15:15.440 --> 00:15:18.920 align:middle line:84%
became a really
important component

00:15:18.920 --> 00:15:24.320 align:middle line:84%
of the 20th century in our
exploration of ourselves

00:15:24.320 --> 00:15:26.430 align:middle line:90%
as a country and as a planet.

00:15:26.430 --> 00:15:32.199 align:middle line:84%
So this explosion, this
sun, literally radiating

00:15:32.199 --> 00:15:33.990 align:middle line:84%
into the eighth house
of the United States,

00:15:33.990 --> 00:15:38.300 align:middle line:84%
into our Mercury, I think was
a pretty interesting event,

00:15:38.300 --> 00:15:43.840 align:middle line:84%
which manifested in deeper
awareness, deeper psychological

00:15:43.840 --> 00:15:46.220 align:middle line:90%
and even shamanic awareness.

00:15:46.220 --> 00:15:48.470 align:middle line:84%
And it is, again, taking
place in the house of death.

00:15:48.470 --> 00:15:49.420 align:middle line:90%
Here's Pluto.

00:15:49.420 --> 00:15:51.150 align:middle line:90%
Transiting Pluto in Leo.

00:15:51.150 --> 00:15:53.840 align:middle line:84%
Right off the true node
again in the eighth house,

00:15:53.840 --> 00:15:54.650 align:middle line:90%
the house of death.

00:15:54.650 --> 00:15:57.930 align:middle line:84%
And we have Mercury here
almost in the ninth house.

00:15:57.930 --> 00:16:01.240 align:middle line:84%
And kind of an echo of
Mercury here at the beginning.

00:16:01.240 --> 00:16:04.130 align:middle line:84%
Mercury is retrograde, by
the way, in the US chart.

00:16:04.130 --> 00:16:06.375 align:middle line:84%
We move up to the
ninth house and here

00:16:06.375 --> 00:16:08.220 align:middle line:90%
is Neptune in the US chart.

00:16:08.220 --> 00:16:10.020 align:middle line:84%
Here's Jupiter, and
then here's Chiron.

00:16:10.020 --> 00:16:14.650 align:middle line:84%
What did we do after we blew
this bomb off in New Mexico?

00:16:14.650 --> 00:16:16.701 align:middle line:90%
We took it overseas.

00:16:16.701 --> 00:16:17.450 align:middle line:90%
We took it abroad.

00:16:17.450 --> 00:16:18.660 align:middle line:90%
We took it to Japan.

00:16:18.660 --> 00:16:21.350 align:middle line:84%
And that's what the ninth house
represents, other countries.

00:16:21.350 --> 00:16:24.960 align:middle line:84%
And then we began to build,
through GE, nuclear power

00:16:24.960 --> 00:16:26.980 align:middle line:90%
plants all over the world.

00:16:26.980 --> 00:16:29.410 align:middle line:84%
And then here we have,
again, this connection

00:16:29.410 --> 00:16:33.220 align:middle line:90%
between the moon and Saturn.

00:16:33.220 --> 00:16:35.620 align:middle line:84%
Over here we have the
connection between the sun

00:16:35.620 --> 00:16:37.780 align:middle line:90%
and Saturn as well.

00:16:37.780 --> 00:16:40.710 align:middle line:84%
So there is a karmic,
again, relationship

00:16:40.710 --> 00:16:43.220 align:middle line:90%
for using this energy.

00:16:43.220 --> 00:16:47.611 align:middle line:84%
And in some way, shape, or
form at some point in time,

00:16:47.611 --> 00:16:49.360 align:middle line:84%
we're going to have
to become peacemakers,

00:16:49.360 --> 00:16:52.180 align:middle line:84%
because that's what the moon
in Libra and Saturn in Libra

00:16:52.180 --> 00:16:52.680 align:middle line:90%
represents.

00:16:52.680 --> 00:16:55.420 align:middle line:84%
It represents peace
and mediation.

00:16:55.420 --> 00:16:59.360 align:middle line:84%
So in the long haul,
in the hopefully not so

00:16:59.360 --> 00:17:02.180 align:middle line:84%
distant future,
this will manifest

00:17:02.180 --> 00:17:06.180 align:middle line:84%
in not just peace for
us in this country,

00:17:06.180 --> 00:17:09.274 align:middle line:84%
but for the world
at large as well.

00:17:09.274 --> 00:17:10.190 align:middle line:90%
So let's move on here.

00:17:10.190 --> 00:17:11.314 align:middle line:90%
This is Robert Oppenheimer.

00:17:11.314 --> 00:17:13.770 align:middle line:90%


00:17:13.770 --> 00:17:15.900 align:middle line:84%
I have become the
angel of death.

00:17:15.900 --> 00:17:20.200 align:middle line:84%
That's what he said
after the bomb went off.

00:17:20.200 --> 00:17:22.550 align:middle line:84%
He is the not the
architect of the bomb,

00:17:22.550 --> 00:17:25.490 align:middle line:84%
but he was like the project
manager of the Manhattan

00:17:25.490 --> 00:17:26.460 align:middle line:90%
Project.

00:17:26.460 --> 00:17:27.859 align:middle line:90%
But it was his baby.

00:17:27.859 --> 00:17:30.030 align:middle line:84%
And apparently,
once it went off,

00:17:30.030 --> 00:17:32.400 align:middle line:90%
he was quite proud of himself.

00:17:32.400 --> 00:17:34.110 align:middle line:90%
So let's look at his chart.

00:17:34.110 --> 00:17:36.910 align:middle line:84%
What's really interesting--
let me go back to him.

00:17:36.910 --> 00:17:39.050 align:middle line:84%
What's really interesting
about Oppenheimer

00:17:39.050 --> 00:17:43.980 align:middle line:84%
is that he is the guy that
named the bomb Trinity.

00:17:43.980 --> 00:17:45.360 align:middle line:90%
That was his name for it.

00:17:45.360 --> 00:17:48.930 align:middle line:84%
He said it was inspired
by a John Donne poem.

00:17:48.930 --> 00:17:51.230 align:middle line:84%
But what's really
interesting about Oppenheimer

00:17:51.230 --> 00:17:55.310 align:middle line:84%
is that he was born
on the 22nd of April.

00:17:55.310 --> 00:17:59.410 align:middle line:84%
Now, I did a show on the Pluto
in Sagittarius generation.

00:17:59.410 --> 00:18:05.000 align:middle line:84%
And one of the members of
the last iteration of Pluto

00:18:05.000 --> 00:18:09.800 align:middle line:84%
in Sagittarius, which was just
before the American Revolution,

00:18:09.800 --> 00:18:12.130 align:middle line:84%
one of the people that
was born during that time

00:18:12.130 --> 00:18:17.310 align:middle line:84%
was James Freeman, who was
the first Unitarian minister.

00:18:17.310 --> 00:18:19.420 align:middle line:90%
And what did James Freeman do?

00:18:19.420 --> 00:18:22.820 align:middle line:84%
James Freeman
abolished the Trinity.

00:18:22.820 --> 00:18:25.890 align:middle line:84%
He got rid of the
notion of the Father

00:18:25.890 --> 00:18:28.590 align:middle line:90%
and the Son and the Holy Ghost.

00:18:28.590 --> 00:18:30.200 align:middle line:90%
And he was born on April 22.

00:18:30.200 --> 00:18:32.820 align:middle line:84%
And what did Robert
Oppenheimer do?

00:18:32.820 --> 00:18:33.900 align:middle line:90%
Born April 22.

00:18:33.900 --> 00:18:36.857 align:middle line:84%
He brought the Trinity,
or he brought Trinity back

00:18:36.857 --> 00:18:37.815 align:middle line:90%
into our consciousness.

00:18:37.815 --> 00:18:41.110 align:middle line:84%
It's kind of an
interesting juxtaposition.

00:18:41.110 --> 00:18:43.240 align:middle line:84%
When we look at
Oppenheimer's chart,

00:18:43.240 --> 00:18:45.650 align:middle line:90%
we see Gemini on the ascendant.

00:18:45.650 --> 00:18:50.730 align:middle line:84%
But if we were to put the
aspects of the explosion

00:18:50.730 --> 00:18:52.560 align:middle line:84%
of the atomic bomb
at White Sands,

00:18:52.560 --> 00:18:54.540 align:middle line:84%
it would all be in
his first house.

00:18:54.540 --> 00:18:57.070 align:middle line:84%
So he would be personally
identified with this.

00:18:57.070 --> 00:18:59.210 align:middle line:84%
This project would be
personally identified

00:18:59.210 --> 00:19:01.010 align:middle line:90%
with him, and vice versa.

00:19:01.010 --> 00:19:04.506 align:middle line:84%
Here we have Pluto in Gemini
and it's in the 12th house.

00:19:04.506 --> 00:19:05.630 align:middle line:90%
So we're dealing with what?

00:19:05.630 --> 00:19:07.980 align:middle line:84%
We're dealing with
plutonium, but we're also

00:19:07.980 --> 00:19:08.880 align:middle line:90%
dealing with Gemini.

00:19:08.880 --> 00:19:12.100 align:middle line:84%
So there are two
sides of that story.

00:19:12.100 --> 00:19:14.690 align:middle line:84%
There's the official
side of the story, which

00:19:14.690 --> 00:19:17.670 align:middle line:84%
is what we get with the
history of the atomic bomb.

00:19:17.670 --> 00:19:20.264 align:middle line:84%
And then there's the
unofficial side of the story.

00:19:20.264 --> 00:19:21.680 align:middle line:84%
The unofficial
side of the story--

00:19:21.680 --> 00:19:24.270 align:middle line:84%
you can look this up--
the Manhattan Project

00:19:24.270 --> 00:19:28.270 align:middle line:84%
was named after, theoretically,
Bernard Baruch who

00:19:28.270 --> 00:19:31.660 align:middle line:84%
supposedly funded
the Manhattan Project

00:19:31.660 --> 00:19:35.340 align:middle line:84%
and ran the whole thing out of
his apartment in New York City.

00:19:35.340 --> 00:19:37.890 align:middle line:90%
So Pluto here, plutonium.

00:19:37.890 --> 00:19:40.770 align:middle line:84%
Gemini, two stories,
or two different types

00:19:40.770 --> 00:19:43.320 align:middle line:84%
of interpretations,
a double narrative

00:19:43.320 --> 00:19:45.750 align:middle line:84%
shows up in 12th house,
the hidden house.

00:19:45.750 --> 00:19:50.710 align:middle line:84%
Now, it's trining Saturn in
Aquarius in the ninth house.

00:19:50.710 --> 00:19:53.510 align:middle line:84%
The mid-heaven's at
two degrees Pisces.

00:19:53.510 --> 00:19:56.760 align:middle line:84%
So he's got Saturn
in Aquarius here,

00:19:56.760 --> 00:19:59.780 align:middle line:90%
so he has a very Aquarian slant.

00:19:59.780 --> 00:20:02.220 align:middle line:84%
What is the plant
that rules Aquarius?

00:20:02.220 --> 00:20:04.000 align:middle line:90%
It's Uranus.

00:20:04.000 --> 00:20:06.870 align:middle line:84%
And of course, we're dealing
with uranium right here

00:20:06.870 --> 00:20:08.440 align:middle line:90%
on the seventh house cusp.

00:20:08.440 --> 00:20:09.650 align:middle line:90%
There is your uranium.

00:20:09.650 --> 00:20:13.920 align:middle line:84%
It opposes the ascendant
because Uranus is at 29 degrees

00:20:13.920 --> 00:20:17.280 align:middle line:84%
Sagittarius anaretic degree,
and it opposes his ascendant.

00:20:17.280 --> 00:20:22.021 align:middle line:84%
So there's this dynamic kind of
tension with the Uranian energy

00:20:22.021 --> 00:20:23.770 align:middle line:84%
that's pulling at him
in the seventh house

00:20:23.770 --> 00:20:27.340 align:middle line:84%
and the relationships that
he has within the Manhattan

00:20:27.340 --> 00:20:29.920 align:middle line:84%
Project all in
that seventh house,

00:20:29.920 --> 00:20:33.780 align:middle line:84%
and how he's going to
channel it and direct it

00:20:33.780 --> 00:20:37.880 align:middle line:84%
as the organizer and the
manager of the Manhattan Project

00:20:37.880 --> 00:20:41.220 align:middle line:84%
through that Cancerian
ascendant as well.

00:20:41.220 --> 00:20:43.610 align:middle line:90%
And we look at Aries here.

00:20:43.610 --> 00:20:47.410 align:middle line:84%
He's got Venus in Aries,
he's got Mars in Aries.

00:20:47.410 --> 00:20:49.910 align:middle line:90%
They are conjunct at 11 degrees.

00:20:49.910 --> 00:20:50.930 align:middle line:90%
There's 22.

00:20:50.930 --> 00:20:52.780 align:middle line:90%
There's the number 22 again.

00:20:52.780 --> 00:20:55.940 align:middle line:84%
And what did we see
with the universal time

00:20:55.940 --> 00:20:57.320 align:middle line:90%
for when the bomb went off.

00:20:57.320 --> 00:20:59.260 align:middle line:90%
It was at 22 degrees.

00:20:59.260 --> 00:21:00.810 align:middle line:90%
What day was he born on?

00:21:00.810 --> 00:21:02.230 align:middle line:84%
Actually it was
11/11, so it would

00:21:02.230 --> 00:21:03.870 align:middle line:90%
have been 22, the number 22.

00:21:03.870 --> 00:21:06.280 align:middle line:84%
And then we have Friday,
the 22nd of April,

00:21:06.280 --> 00:21:07.720 align:middle line:90%
so there's 22 again.

00:21:07.720 --> 00:21:09.320 align:middle line:90%
22's showing up in a big way.

00:21:09.320 --> 00:21:10.600 align:middle line:90%
And what is Aries?

00:21:10.600 --> 00:21:15.380 align:middle line:84%
It's the energy of war
and conflict and energy.

00:21:15.380 --> 00:21:17.560 align:middle line:84%
And he's got Venus
and Jupiter there,

00:21:17.560 --> 00:21:20.180 align:middle line:84%
and they're going to be
using this energy, obviously,

00:21:20.180 --> 00:21:24.030 align:middle line:84%
in Japan in the
military theater.

00:21:24.030 --> 00:21:27.540 align:middle line:84%
And this is all, again, it's got
a very wide house, 11th house,

00:21:27.540 --> 00:21:29.080 align:middle line:90%
which is the house of Aquarius.

00:21:29.080 --> 00:21:32.650 align:middle line:84%
And some people think
that the age of Aquarius

00:21:32.650 --> 00:21:36.020 align:middle line:84%
actually started when the atomic
bomb, the first atomic bomb,

00:21:36.020 --> 00:21:38.730 align:middle line:90%
went off.

00:21:38.730 --> 00:21:42.195 align:middle line:84%
So here we have the
next two atomic bombs

00:21:42.195 --> 00:21:46.470 align:middle line:84%
that were exploded in Japan:
Hiroshima and Nagasaki.

00:21:46.470 --> 00:21:48.200 align:middle line:90%
Now, look at the degree.

00:21:48.200 --> 00:21:50.530 align:middle line:90%
We had 33 degrees in New Mexico.

00:21:50.530 --> 00:21:54.730 align:middle line:84%
And here we have Hiroshima
being blown up at 34 degrees.

00:21:54.730 --> 00:21:58.010 align:middle line:84%
It's right along that 33rd
degree parallel, which

00:21:58.010 --> 00:22:00.554 align:middle line:84%
goes all the way
around the planet.

00:22:00.554 --> 00:22:01.970 align:middle line:84%
Now, what I found
was interesting.

00:22:01.970 --> 00:22:04.430 align:middle line:84%
I was just doing some
fact finding and research

00:22:04.430 --> 00:22:08.550 align:middle line:84%
on Hiroshima, and this
is the flag of Hiroshima,

00:22:08.550 --> 00:22:11.990 align:middle line:84%
and this is the
sign of Aquarius.

00:22:11.990 --> 00:22:13.130 align:middle line:90%
This is really interesting.

00:22:13.130 --> 00:22:16.770 align:middle line:84%
I'd never known that A)
Hiroshima had a flag, and B)

00:22:16.770 --> 00:22:19.750 align:middle line:84%
that it represented
the sign of Aquarius.

00:22:19.750 --> 00:22:23.830 align:middle line:84%
So there's really some
Aquarian and Uranian energy

00:22:23.830 --> 00:22:27.095 align:middle line:84%
that was already at
play with Hiroshima.

00:22:27.095 --> 00:22:28.400 align:middle line:90%
I think it's fascinating.

00:22:28.400 --> 00:22:30.860 align:middle line:84%
It's the wave bearer,
it's the birth

00:22:30.860 --> 00:22:33.680 align:middle line:90%
of the new age in some ways.

00:22:33.680 --> 00:22:39.280 align:middle line:10%
Now here we have Nagasaki, and
it is just a few degrees lower,

00:22:39.280 --> 00:22:43.390 align:middle line:10%
but still very, very close
to that 33rd degree parallel.

00:22:43.390 --> 00:22:45.420 align:middle line:10%
This is at 32 degrees.

00:22:45.420 --> 00:22:49.280 align:middle line:10%
So Hiroshima 34 degrees,
we have White Sands,

00:22:49.280 --> 00:22:54.230 align:middle line:10%
Alamogordo at 33 degrees,
and Nagasaki at 32 degrees.

00:22:54.230 --> 00:22:56.550 align:middle line:10%
And, again, Nagasaki is
a very interesting flag.

00:22:56.550 --> 00:22:59.530 align:middle line:84%
Here we have the five
pointed satanic star.

00:22:59.530 --> 00:23:03.420 align:middle line:84%
And inside the star we have the
cross, the symbol of the cross,

00:23:03.420 --> 00:23:06.240 align:middle line:84%
and then the scimitar,
which is the crescent moon.

00:23:06.240 --> 00:23:08.530 align:middle line:90%
Very interesting stuff.

00:23:08.530 --> 00:23:12.350 align:middle line:84%
So we have these esoteric
and occult flags, which

00:23:12.350 --> 00:23:17.220 align:middle line:84%
represent occult symbolism, for
both Nagasaki and Hiroshima:

00:23:17.220 --> 00:23:20.130 align:middle line:84%
the satanic star, the
five pointed satanic star,

00:23:20.130 --> 00:23:22.660 align:middle line:90%
and the symbol of Aquarius.

00:23:22.660 --> 00:23:28.030 align:middle line:84%
Now here, this is Hiroshima,
and here we have the phoenix.

00:23:28.030 --> 00:23:29.980 align:middle line:84%
This is a sculpture
in Hiroshima.

00:23:29.980 --> 00:23:31.700 align:middle line:84%
And it is a phoenix,
which is literally

00:23:31.700 --> 00:23:35.960 align:middle line:84%
rising from the ashes
of the atomic bomb,

00:23:35.960 --> 00:23:38.050 align:middle line:84%
and it's standing
on top of the world.

00:23:38.050 --> 00:23:42.050 align:middle line:84%
This is the symbol of the
new life of Hiroshima.

00:23:42.050 --> 00:23:44.520 align:middle line:90%
So guess what?

00:23:44.520 --> 00:23:48.340 align:middle line:84%
The city of Phoenix is at
33 degrees, the same degree

00:23:48.340 --> 00:23:53.190 align:middle line:84%
as the explosion at
White Sands, New Mexico.

00:23:53.190 --> 00:23:55.090 align:middle line:90%
Pretty interesting.

00:23:55.090 --> 00:24:02.510 align:middle line:84%
By the way, a tyre, T-Y-R-E,
in Phoenicia is also at 33

00:24:02.510 --> 00:24:03.660 align:middle line:90%
degrees.

00:24:03.660 --> 00:24:06.160 align:middle line:84%
And we have Phoenix
at 33 degrees.

00:24:06.160 --> 00:24:08.000 align:middle line:90%
Phoenix, Phoenicia.

00:24:08.000 --> 00:24:09.400 align:middle line:90%
Interesting connections.

00:24:09.400 --> 00:24:10.530 align:middle line:90%
But there's more.

00:24:10.530 --> 00:24:12.970 align:middle line:84%
There is more to the
33rd degree parallel

00:24:12.970 --> 00:24:15.090 align:middle line:84%
and the mystery of
the 33rd degree.

00:24:15.090 --> 00:24:19.230 align:middle line:84%
Events, major events take
place along this line.

00:24:19.230 --> 00:24:21.280 align:middle line:84%
Not just the explosion
of atomic bombs--

00:24:21.280 --> 00:24:22.930 align:middle line:84%
those are not
trivial, by the way.

00:24:22.930 --> 00:24:26.300 align:middle line:84%
But other events that
have changed our lives.

00:24:26.300 --> 00:24:29.020 align:middle line:90%
Let's find out some of those.

00:24:29.020 --> 00:24:32.020 align:middle line:84%
This is, theoretically,
this is a depiction

00:24:32.020 --> 00:24:35.480 align:middle line:84%
of the crash of
the UFO at where?

00:24:35.480 --> 00:24:36.120 align:middle line:90%
Roswell.

00:24:36.120 --> 00:24:37.250 align:middle line:90%
At what degree?

00:24:37.250 --> 00:24:40.020 align:middle line:90%
33 degrees, again.

00:24:40.020 --> 00:24:44.370 align:middle line:84%
And apparently,
the Roswell crash

00:24:44.370 --> 00:24:48.390 align:middle line:84%
took place after the
atomic bomb went off.

00:24:48.390 --> 00:24:52.590 align:middle line:84%
And that theoretically,
the atomic bomb had opened,

00:24:52.590 --> 00:24:57.510 align:middle line:84%
ripped a portal in the
time-space continuum,

00:24:57.510 --> 00:24:59.870 align:middle line:84%
and that these flying
saucers were now

00:24:59.870 --> 00:25:03.430 align:middle line:84%
coming through the rip in
the time space continuum.

00:25:03.430 --> 00:25:05.620 align:middle line:84%
This is what apparently
happened, according

00:25:05.620 --> 00:25:08.880 align:middle line:84%
to people inside
the UFO community.

00:25:08.880 --> 00:25:12.050 align:middle line:84%
And as a result,
the UFOs weren't

00:25:12.050 --> 00:25:15.740 align:middle line:84%
necessarily extraterrestrial,
but innerdimensional.

00:25:15.740 --> 00:25:18.590 align:middle line:84%
And the Roswell crash,
apparently, they

00:25:18.590 --> 00:25:20.300 align:middle line:84%
were able to retrieve
a body from this.

00:25:20.300 --> 00:25:23.360 align:middle line:84%
This is part of the
folklore of Roswell,

00:25:23.360 --> 00:25:27.200 align:middle line:84%
which is a really important
part of the 20th century.

00:25:27.200 --> 00:25:31.062 align:middle line:84%
And they were able to retrieve
an alien, a gray alien

00:25:31.062 --> 00:25:32.770 align:middle line:84%
from this which they
kept alive, and they

00:25:32.770 --> 00:25:36.540 align:middle line:84%
called this gray alien EBE,
extraterrestrial biological

00:25:36.540 --> 00:25:37.460 align:middle line:90%
entity.

00:25:37.460 --> 00:25:39.980 align:middle line:90%
That's what the initials were.

00:25:39.980 --> 00:25:42.600 align:middle line:90%
And apparently EBE was a liar.

00:25:42.600 --> 00:25:44.980 align:middle line:84%
They had figured out
a way to talk to EBE,

00:25:44.980 --> 00:25:46.360 align:middle line:90%
and asked him questions.

00:25:46.360 --> 00:25:49.030 align:middle line:10%
And eventually,
they kept him alive,

00:25:49.030 --> 00:25:53.530 align:middle line:10%
and he was sort of this kind
of chlorophyll-based being.

00:25:53.530 --> 00:25:57.030 align:middle line:10%
And he started to talk to them
and give them information.

00:25:57.030 --> 00:25:59.410 align:middle line:10%
And as a result of
this information,

00:25:59.410 --> 00:26:02.670 align:middle line:10%
they used it to
contact EBE's people.

00:26:02.670 --> 00:26:06.682 align:middle line:10%
And the character ET is
actually based on EBE.

00:26:06.682 --> 00:26:08.450 align:middle line:84%
And so then what
happened is they

00:26:08.450 --> 00:26:10.750 align:middle line:84%
started to send a
signal through space.

00:26:10.750 --> 00:26:13.380 align:middle line:84%
And then EBE's homies
started showing up.

00:26:13.380 --> 00:26:15.000 align:middle line:84%
And that's when
things apparently

00:26:15.000 --> 00:26:16.680 align:middle line:90%
got very interesting.

00:26:16.680 --> 00:26:19.310 align:middle line:90%
Dwight Eisenhower was called in.

00:26:19.310 --> 00:26:22.490 align:middle line:84%
Gerald Light, who
was a metaphysician.

00:26:22.490 --> 00:26:26.430 align:middle line:84%
There was a bishop
that was called in.

00:26:26.430 --> 00:26:27.360 align:middle line:90%
There was military.

00:26:27.360 --> 00:26:30.450 align:middle line:84%
And they met with
EBE's homies, who

00:26:30.450 --> 00:26:32.404 align:middle line:84%
were essentially
the gray aliens.

00:26:32.404 --> 00:26:35.070 align:middle line:10%
And what they did is they showed
them really mind-blowing stuff,

00:26:35.070 --> 00:26:39.380 align:middle line:10%
and that's when the deals
were made to sort of trade off

00:26:39.380 --> 00:26:45.670 align:middle line:10%
technology with being able to
abduct and temporarily hang out

00:26:45.670 --> 00:26:47.620 align:middle line:10%
with humans and take
flesh samples and all

00:26:47.620 --> 00:26:48.750 align:middle line:10%
those good things.

00:26:48.750 --> 00:26:50.670 align:middle line:10%
So it all starts
really, theoretically,

00:26:50.670 --> 00:26:53.960 align:middle line:10%
on the heels of the atomic
bomb explosion, which

00:26:53.960 --> 00:26:56.254 align:middle line:10%
happens on the 33rd
degree parallel.

00:26:56.254 --> 00:26:56.920 align:middle line:90%
There's Roswell.

00:26:56.920 --> 00:26:58.490 align:middle line:90%
There's more.

00:26:58.490 --> 00:27:00.410 align:middle line:90%
Bermuda Triangle.

00:27:00.410 --> 00:27:02.160 align:middle line:84%
Here we see the
Bermuda Triangle.

00:27:02.160 --> 00:27:05.870 align:middle line:84%
Here's Miami, Puerto
Rico, and here is Bermuda.

00:27:05.870 --> 00:27:09.890 align:middle line:84%
If you were to cut across, all
the way across the country,

00:27:09.890 --> 00:27:13.190 align:middle line:84%
you would see that this is
the 33rd degree parallel.

00:27:13.190 --> 00:27:17.405 align:middle line:84%
So the Bermuda Triangle, which
is an interesting vortex,

00:27:17.405 --> 00:27:21.280 align:middle line:90%
is at the 33rd degree parallel.

00:27:21.280 --> 00:27:25.840 align:middle line:84%
Here's another really
interesting 33rd degree event.

00:27:25.840 --> 00:27:29.640 align:middle line:84%
Actually, it's around 30-- I
believe it's at 34 degrees.

00:27:29.640 --> 00:27:36.630 align:middle line:84%
This is JFK, and he's
killed on 11/22, 1963,

00:27:36.630 --> 00:27:40.860 align:middle line:84%
and it's on that same parallel
that the atomic bomb was

00:27:40.860 --> 00:27:44.880 align:middle line:84%
exploded on in
Alamogordo/White Sands,

00:27:44.880 --> 00:27:48.820 align:middle line:84%
and, of course, Nagasaki
and Hiroshima and Roswell

00:27:48.820 --> 00:27:49.950 align:middle line:90%
and the Bermuda Triangle.

00:27:49.950 --> 00:27:53.260 align:middle line:84%
So it's all happening
right on that line.

00:27:53.260 --> 00:27:54.310 align:middle line:90%
Right on that line.

00:27:54.310 --> 00:27:57.900 align:middle line:84%
And, of course, we've
explored this in other shows

00:27:57.900 --> 00:28:00.430 align:middle line:84%
with the alternate
timeline of JFK

00:28:00.430 --> 00:28:02.560 align:middle line:84%
and what happened
as a result of this.

00:28:02.560 --> 00:28:05.100 align:middle line:84%
And, perhaps, powering
that on the back end

00:28:05.100 --> 00:28:07.460 align:middle line:84%
was the explosion
at White Sands,

00:28:07.460 --> 00:28:11.070 align:middle line:84%
New Mexico, which was the
catalyst for the quote,

00:28:11.070 --> 00:28:14.010 align:middle line:84%
unquote, "the beginning
of the new age."

00:28:14.010 --> 00:28:16.080 align:middle line:90%
There's other events.

00:28:16.080 --> 00:28:17.330 align:middle line:90%
Here's Charles Manson.

00:28:17.330 --> 00:28:20.000 align:middle line:10%
The Manson family, the
Tate-LaBianca murders

00:28:20.000 --> 00:28:23.630 align:middle line:10%
took place at the 34 degree
parallel in Los Angeles.

00:28:23.630 --> 00:28:26.580 align:middle line:10%
There is also the Black
Dahlia, there's Roman Polanski.

00:28:26.580 --> 00:28:31.770 align:middle line:84%
There's all kinds of other
crazy, insane, Hollywood-based,

00:28:31.770 --> 00:28:35.290 align:middle line:84%
trauma-based events,
ritual-based events,

00:28:35.290 --> 00:28:38.570 align:middle line:84%
occult events, all coming
out of Los Angeles, all

00:28:38.570 --> 00:28:40.690 align:middle line:90%
on the 34 degree parallel.

00:28:40.690 --> 00:28:45.050 align:middle line:84%
Martin Luther King was
killed in Memphis-- Memphis,

00:28:45.050 --> 00:28:46.300 align:middle line:90%
the City of Kings.

00:28:46.300 --> 00:28:48.480 align:middle line:84%
That's what Memphis
is, the City of Kings.

00:28:48.480 --> 00:28:51.900 align:middle line:84%
Martin Luther King was killed
in Memphis, the 35th degree

00:28:51.900 --> 00:28:53.390 align:middle line:84%
parallel, just a
few degrees off.

00:28:53.390 --> 00:28:55.117 align:middle line:90%
But again, part of this line.

00:28:55.117 --> 00:28:56.200 align:middle line:90%
And here's Charles Manson.

00:28:56.200 --> 00:29:00.050 align:middle line:84%
So there is a rich-- the 33rd
degree parallel is a ritual

00:29:00.050 --> 00:29:02.190 align:middle line:84%
line that runs all the
way around the planet.

00:29:02.190 --> 00:29:05.770 align:middle line:84%
And we can see where atomic
bombs and atomic events,

00:29:05.770 --> 00:29:09.050 align:middle line:84%
like the death of Kennedy, have
absolutely altered and changed

00:29:09.050 --> 00:29:11.190 align:middle line:90%
history and even our timeline.

00:29:11.190 --> 00:29:13.870 align:middle line:84%
Another event which took place
on the 33rd degree parallel

00:29:13.870 --> 00:29:16.370 align:middle line:84%
was the Heaven's Gate
event, which took place

00:29:16.370 --> 00:29:19.340 align:middle line:84%
in San Diego in
Ranch-- where was it?

00:29:19.340 --> 00:29:20.660 align:middle line:90%
Rancho San Diego?

00:29:20.660 --> 00:29:24.510 align:middle line:84%
It was in San Diego, and again,
the 33rd degree parallel,

00:29:24.510 --> 00:29:26.360 align:middle line:90%
which is also part and parcel.

00:29:26.360 --> 00:29:28.150 align:middle line:84%
Again, extends all
around the planet,

00:29:28.150 --> 00:29:31.570 align:middle line:84%
so you can see it show up in
the Middle East and Egypt, too.

00:29:31.570 --> 00:29:33.310 align:middle line:90%
So there we go.

00:29:33.310 --> 00:29:38.090 align:middle line:84%
We have explored the
astrology of the atomic bomb

00:29:38.090 --> 00:29:39.920 align:middle line:90%
and the ramifications of it.

00:29:39.920 --> 00:29:42.390 align:middle line:84%
And, again, Pluto's
in Capricorn,

00:29:42.390 --> 00:29:47.060 align:middle line:84%
and it's going to be swinging
around and opposing that Saturn

00:29:47.060 --> 00:29:50.380 align:middle line:84%
at 15 degrees, which is
right on the ascendant.

00:29:50.380 --> 00:29:52.360 align:middle line:84%
So between now and
then we're going

00:29:52.360 --> 00:29:56.600 align:middle line:84%
to have some really interesting
pieces of information

00:29:56.600 --> 00:30:00.030 align:middle line:84%
and ephemera that
are going to emerge

00:30:00.030 --> 00:30:03.000 align:middle line:84%
around the atomic bomb,
that first atomic bomb.

00:30:03.000 --> 00:30:07.010 align:middle line:84%
And I think we're going to be
dealing with the karma of that,

00:30:07.010 --> 00:30:08.877 align:middle line:84%
the planetary
karma, and the karma

00:30:08.877 --> 00:30:10.460 align:middle line:84%
as it relates to
this country as well.

00:30:10.460 --> 00:30:12.970 align:middle line:84%
And, of course, we're
on the brink of war,

00:30:12.970 --> 00:30:16.187 align:middle line:84%
theoretically, in Ukraine, and
there's a whole other series

00:30:16.187 --> 00:30:18.270 align:middle line:84%
of events that are taking
place in the world which

00:30:18.270 --> 00:30:19.790 align:middle line:90%
are putting everybody on edge.

00:30:19.790 --> 00:30:21.530 align:middle line:84%
The Cold War is
beginning all over again,

00:30:21.530 --> 00:30:24.840 align:middle line:84%
folks, and the atomic bomb
was everybody's best friend

00:30:24.840 --> 00:30:28.560 align:middle line:84%
during the Cold War or their
worst enemy, one of the two.

00:30:28.560 --> 00:30:29.360 align:middle line:10%
That's it.

00:30:29.360 --> 00:30:30.920 align:middle line:10%
I want to thank
you for joining me

00:30:30.920 --> 00:30:33.960 align:middle line:10%
on yet another edition
of "The Eleventh House."

00:30:33.960 --> 00:30:37.170 align:middle line:84%
I'm Robert Phoenix and may
the stars always be with you.
