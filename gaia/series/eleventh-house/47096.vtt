Hi, I'm Robert Phoenix,
and welcome to it.

00:03:30.550 --> 00:03:33.940 align:middle line:84%
Let's get right into
the subject matter here.

00:03:33.940 --> 00:03:36.600 align:middle line:84%
We're talking about
Sagittarius and primarily Pluto

00:03:36.600 --> 00:03:37.510 align:middle line:90%
in Sagittarius.

00:03:37.510 --> 00:03:41.150 align:middle line:84%
Here we have the
constellation of Sagittarius.

00:03:41.150 --> 00:03:42.560 align:middle line:10%
It's the Archer.

00:03:42.560 --> 00:03:47.480 align:middle line:10%
And unlike their previous
generation, Pluto in Scorpio,

00:03:47.480 --> 00:03:49.320 align:middle line:10%
it's a fairly
different vibration.

00:03:49.320 --> 00:03:52.150 align:middle line:84%
It's a fairly different
aspect of the expression

00:03:52.150 --> 00:03:55.830 align:middle line:84%
of consciousness, and we're
going to get into those aspects

00:03:55.830 --> 00:03:57.580 align:middle line:90%
here with this slide.

00:03:57.580 --> 00:04:00.950 align:middle line:84%
So let's talk about the time
that Pluto is in Sagittarius.

00:04:00.950 --> 00:04:03.391 align:middle line:84%
I call this "The Hunger
Games" Generation

00:04:03.391 --> 00:04:05.640 align:middle line:84%
because the symbol for "The
Hunger Games," of courses,

00:04:05.640 --> 00:04:07.350 align:middle line:90%
is Katniss Everdeen.

00:04:07.350 --> 00:04:09.970 align:middle line:84%
And what does she
specialize in, in terms

00:04:09.970 --> 00:04:11.930 align:middle line:84%
of her weaponry in
"The Hunger Games"?

00:04:11.930 --> 00:04:15.060 align:middle line:84%
She specializes in
the bow and arrow,

00:04:15.060 --> 00:04:18.600 align:middle line:84%
so clearly this is a
symbol and archetypal

00:04:18.600 --> 00:04:20.940 align:middle line:90%
icon for the generation.

00:04:20.940 --> 00:04:25.470 align:middle line:84%
If we think that the generation
has the astrological DNA born

00:04:25.470 --> 00:04:27.820 align:middle line:84%
into it, then something
like "The Hunger Games"

00:04:27.820 --> 00:04:31.710 align:middle line:84%
certainly would be a trigger
symbol for that generation.

00:04:31.710 --> 00:04:32.620 align:middle line:90%
So here we go.

00:04:32.620 --> 00:04:36.640 align:middle line:84%
January 1995 to
January 2008 is when

00:04:36.640 --> 00:04:38.625 align:middle line:84%
Pluto was in the
sign of Sagittarius.

00:04:38.625 --> 00:04:41.650 align:middle line:84%
Now there are
subaspects, of course,

00:04:41.650 --> 00:04:43.890 align:middle line:84%
with any kind of
major Pluto movement.

00:04:43.890 --> 00:04:46.100 align:middle line:84%
But the Pluto in
Sagittarius generation

00:04:46.100 --> 00:04:49.060 align:middle line:84%
had a number of
them, primarily as it

00:04:49.060 --> 00:04:51.630 align:middle line:90%
related to Uranus and Neptune.

00:04:51.630 --> 00:04:55.500 align:middle line:84%
Now when Pluto first when
into Sagittarius, Uranus

00:04:55.500 --> 00:04:58.030 align:middle line:84%
was in Aquarius and
Neptune was in Aquarius.

00:04:58.030 --> 00:05:00.490 align:middle line:84%
They were all kind of
fairly late degrees.

00:05:00.490 --> 00:05:05.350 align:middle line:84%
And by the time it had
left Pluto in Sagittarius,

00:05:05.350 --> 00:05:09.570 align:middle line:84%
Uranus in Pisces-- Uranus
and Neptune had also shifted.

00:05:09.570 --> 00:05:12.620 align:middle line:84%
So Uranus had moved
into Pisces, and Neptune

00:05:12.620 --> 00:05:14.120 align:middle line:90%
moved into Aquarius.

00:05:14.120 --> 00:05:15.620 align:middle line:90%
They kind of flip-flopped there.

00:05:15.620 --> 00:05:18.700 align:middle line:84%
And what happened
was-- I'm sorry.

00:05:18.700 --> 00:05:21.316 align:middle line:84%
Well, Uranus--
Neptune was-- Neptune

00:05:21.316 --> 00:05:22.440 align:middle line:90%
was definitely in Aquarius.

00:05:22.440 --> 00:05:23.130 align:middle line:90%
My apologies.

00:05:23.130 --> 00:05:25.490 align:middle line:84%
But Uranus had
shifted into Pisces.

00:05:25.490 --> 00:05:28.050 align:middle line:84%
And the difference
is kind of distinct.

00:05:28.050 --> 00:05:31.010 align:middle line:84%
The early part of
Pluto in Sagittarius

00:05:31.010 --> 00:05:35.650 align:middle line:84%
has this super electric
energy with Uranus and Neptune

00:05:35.650 --> 00:05:36.150 align:middle line:90%
in Aquarius.

00:05:36.150 --> 00:05:38.470 align:middle line:84%
These people are going
to be system-busters,

00:05:38.470 --> 00:05:42.250 align:middle line:84%
and they're already starting
to come into society.

00:05:42.250 --> 00:05:45.650 align:middle line:84%
You may have read recently
about a young woman who

00:05:45.650 --> 00:05:50.460 align:middle line:84%
sued her parents because
they didn't give her

00:05:50.460 --> 00:05:52.700 align:middle line:84%
what she wanted, and
they cut her off,

00:05:52.700 --> 00:05:55.540 align:middle line:84%
and they said that she
had to go to the school

00:05:55.540 --> 00:06:00.530 align:middle line:84%
that they were paying for
and a number of other things.

00:06:00.530 --> 00:06:03.740 align:middle line:84%
Unfortunately, she's
sort of this first wave

00:06:03.740 --> 00:06:06.720 align:middle line:84%
of Pluto in Sagittarius
coming to our consciousness

00:06:06.720 --> 00:06:08.140 align:middle line:90%
in many ways.

00:06:08.140 --> 00:06:11.930 align:middle line:84%
And she challenged
her parents and lost,

00:06:11.930 --> 00:06:15.780 align:middle line:84%
by the way, in a court of law,
which is ruled by Sagittarius.

00:06:15.780 --> 00:06:18.300 align:middle line:84%
So the first generation is just
now starting to come online.

00:06:18.300 --> 00:06:20.570 align:middle line:90%
They're super bright.

00:06:20.570 --> 00:06:22.030 align:middle line:84%
They are pretty
advanced, in terms

00:06:22.030 --> 00:06:25.710 align:middle line:84%
of things that they look at
from a cultural perspective.

00:06:25.710 --> 00:06:28.910 align:middle line:84%
The second part of the
Pluto in Sagittarius

00:06:28.910 --> 00:06:32.760 align:middle line:84%
generation, where Uranus
was in Pisces and Neptune

00:06:32.760 --> 00:06:34.850 align:middle line:84%
was in Aquarius, they're
a little bit different.

00:06:34.850 --> 00:06:36.870 align:middle line:84%
They're a little
more quirky than the,

00:06:36.870 --> 00:06:38.170 align:middle line:90%
sort of the first wave.

00:06:38.170 --> 00:06:42.930 align:middle line:84%
Uranus in Pisces blends the
kind of electrical awareness

00:06:42.930 --> 00:06:46.860 align:middle line:84%
of any planet that
it's connected with

00:06:46.860 --> 00:06:49.020 align:middle line:84%
or any sign connected
with the planet Uranus.

00:06:49.020 --> 00:06:51.050 align:middle line:84%
But with Pisces,
it gives them kind

00:06:51.050 --> 00:06:53.930 align:middle line:84%
of a heightened psychic
sense and a heightened

00:06:53.930 --> 00:06:54.930 align:middle line:90%
psychic awareness.

00:06:54.930 --> 00:06:57.400 align:middle line:84%
So this is a generation
that's going to be really,

00:06:57.400 --> 00:07:02.400 align:middle line:84%
really attuned to, I would
say, Earth phenomena,

00:07:02.400 --> 00:07:06.160 align:middle line:84%
astronomical-- not astrological,
but astronomical-- phenomena,

00:07:06.160 --> 00:07:08.810 align:middle line:84%
and any kind of changes
in the environment.

00:07:08.810 --> 00:07:12.230 align:middle line:84%
This subgeneration
with Uranus in Pisces

00:07:12.230 --> 00:07:16.480 align:middle line:84%
will be very much connected
to and attuned to those kinds

00:07:16.480 --> 00:07:19.280 align:middle line:84%
of perturbations in
the field, as they say.

00:07:19.280 --> 00:07:21.040 align:middle line:84%
These are some of
the characteristics,

00:07:21.040 --> 00:07:25.330 align:middle line:84%
in general, of the Pluto
in Sagittarius generation.

00:07:25.330 --> 00:07:26.350 align:middle line:90%
They're outgoing.

00:07:26.350 --> 00:07:27.520 align:middle line:90%
They're generally outgoing.

00:07:27.520 --> 00:07:30.740 align:middle line:84%
That represents kind of
a quality of Sagittarius.

00:07:30.740 --> 00:07:32.900 align:middle line:90%
They're team-oriented.

00:07:32.900 --> 00:07:36.790 align:middle line:84%
And this plays a really large
role in their consciousness

00:07:36.790 --> 00:07:40.690 align:middle line:84%
and how their consciousness
can be shaped.

00:07:40.690 --> 00:07:42.190 align:middle line:84%
It's an important
thing to remember.

00:07:42.190 --> 00:07:45.050 align:middle line:84%
Now Pluto in Scorpio are not
necessarily team-oriented.

00:07:45.050 --> 00:07:49.130 align:middle line:84%
Pluto in Scorpio, that
generation, Generation XXX,

00:07:49.130 --> 00:07:50.990 align:middle line:84%
which is what I
like to call them,

00:07:50.990 --> 00:07:53.350 align:middle line:84%
they're into understanding
and finding out

00:07:53.350 --> 00:07:55.990 align:middle line:84%
things about
themselves from a very

00:07:55.990 --> 00:07:57.750 align:middle line:90%
deep psychological perspective.

00:07:57.750 --> 00:08:01.580 align:middle line:84%
And they are risk-takers, but
they're emotional risk-takers.

00:08:01.580 --> 00:08:03.920 align:middle line:84%
They like to push the
boundaries a little bit.

00:08:03.920 --> 00:08:06.570 align:middle line:84%
Pluto in Sagittarius
are risk-takers as well,

00:08:06.570 --> 00:08:08.880 align:middle line:84%
but they're risk-takers
in a physical sense,

00:08:08.880 --> 00:08:11.360 align:middle line:84%
in a natural and
a physical sense.

00:08:11.360 --> 00:08:12.580 align:middle line:90%
But they're team-oriented.

00:08:12.580 --> 00:08:16.550 align:middle line:84%
They enjoy team and
group-related efforts.

00:08:16.550 --> 00:08:18.310 align:middle line:84%
Anything having
to do with sports

00:08:18.310 --> 00:08:21.490 align:middle line:84%
would be very much aligned
with Pluto in Sagittarius.

00:08:21.490 --> 00:08:24.740 align:middle line:84%
They're truth-loving
and truth-seeking.

00:08:24.740 --> 00:08:27.530 align:middle line:84%
And I'll share with you a
story about my own son, who

00:08:27.530 --> 00:08:29.670 align:middle line:90%
is a Pluto in Sagittarius kid.

00:08:29.670 --> 00:08:31.940 align:middle line:84%
He's part of the
latter generation

00:08:31.940 --> 00:08:35.130 align:middle line:84%
or the subgeneration,
Uranus in Pisces.

00:08:35.130 --> 00:08:39.440 align:middle line:84%
And the other day he got out
of my car, and he said to me,

00:08:39.440 --> 00:08:42.820 align:middle line:84%
he said, "Dad, it
kind of sucks when

00:08:42.820 --> 00:08:44.410 align:middle line:84%
things are made
in other countries

00:08:44.410 --> 00:08:46.250 align:middle line:90%
and we lose jobs here."

00:08:46.250 --> 00:08:47.920 align:middle line:90%
And he's 10 years old.

00:08:47.920 --> 00:08:49.300 align:middle line:90%
He just turned 10 on Saturday.

00:08:49.300 --> 00:08:52.660 align:middle line:84%
And I asked him if he got
that from his grandfather, who

00:08:52.660 --> 00:08:56.470 align:middle line:84%
watches FOX News, and he said
no, he didn't get it from that.

00:08:56.470 --> 00:09:00.830 align:middle line:84%
He actually saw a sign that
was near where I lived,

00:09:00.830 --> 00:09:03.240 align:middle line:84%
and the sign, it
said made in India.

00:09:03.240 --> 00:09:05.060 align:middle line:84%
And he told me he
had seen the sign.

00:09:05.060 --> 00:09:07.830 align:middle line:84%
And he did the social
math, and he said, well,

00:09:07.830 --> 00:09:09.595 align:middle line:84%
if they're making
these signs overseas

00:09:09.595 --> 00:09:13.880 align:middle line:84%
or in some other country, then
there aren't as many jobs here,

00:09:13.880 --> 00:09:15.970 align:middle line:84%
or there aren't as
many sign-makers.

00:09:15.970 --> 00:09:18.620 align:middle line:84%
And it's pretty basic,
but in some ways

00:09:18.620 --> 00:09:21.204 align:middle line:84%
it's sort of endemic
of the generation,

00:09:21.204 --> 00:09:23.370 align:middle line:84%
because they're going to
figure through these things

00:09:23.370 --> 00:09:24.300 align:middle line:90%
out on their own.

00:09:24.300 --> 00:09:29.460 align:middle line:84%
They have an innate ability
to get to the center of truth.

00:09:29.460 --> 00:09:32.720 align:middle line:84%
So they're truth-loving,
and they are truth-seeking.

00:09:32.720 --> 00:09:36.070 align:middle line:84%
They appreciate nature,
because Sagittarius,

00:09:36.070 --> 00:09:37.960 align:middle line:84%
when we looked at the
sign, one of the things

00:09:37.960 --> 00:09:40.880 align:middle line:84%
that it rules is the
natural world and animals.

00:09:40.880 --> 00:09:44.880 align:middle line:84%
So as it relates to that,
they'll have loyalty to animals

00:09:44.880 --> 00:09:45.420 align:middle line:90%
down here.

00:09:45.420 --> 00:09:49.410 align:middle line:84%
So you can see them taking up
the quest for either animal

00:09:49.410 --> 00:09:54.540 align:middle line:84%
safety or animal sanctity,
animal rights, and things

00:09:54.540 --> 00:09:57.400 align:middle line:84%
that are related to
the natural world.

00:09:57.400 --> 00:09:58.650 align:middle line:90%
They abhor boredom.

00:09:58.650 --> 00:10:00.935 align:middle line:90%
They are kids that hate boredom.

00:10:00.935 --> 00:10:02.060 align:middle line:90%
They need to be challenged.

00:10:02.060 --> 00:10:04.100 align:middle line:90%
They like physical challenges.

00:10:04.100 --> 00:10:06.580 align:middle line:84%
They like mental
challenges as well.

00:10:06.580 --> 00:10:11.240 align:middle line:84%
I would say that of all the
more recent generations,

00:10:11.240 --> 00:10:13.760 align:middle line:84%
that this generation
would probably

00:10:13.760 --> 00:10:16.360 align:middle line:84%
have the most
difficulty in dealing

00:10:16.360 --> 00:10:18.420 align:middle line:90%
with traditional education.

00:10:18.420 --> 00:10:20.540 align:middle line:84%
So this could be a
generation-- and I

00:10:20.540 --> 00:10:24.540 align:middle line:84%
don't have the figures--
which is more rooted in things

00:10:24.540 --> 00:10:28.320 align:middle line:84%
like home schooling or
alternative schooling

00:10:28.320 --> 00:10:31.440 align:middle line:84%
because traditional education
might be too stifling,

00:10:31.440 --> 00:10:35.170 align:middle line:84%
it might be too regimented
and box-oriented

00:10:35.170 --> 00:10:37.610 align:middle line:84%
for their psyche and
their consciousness.

00:10:37.610 --> 00:10:39.000 align:middle line:90%
They're expansive.

00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:41.410 align:middle line:84%
Sagittarius is an
expansive sign.

00:10:41.410 --> 00:10:43.350 align:middle line:84%
They would have
expansive thoughts.

00:10:43.350 --> 00:10:45.330 align:middle line:84%
They would have
expansive philosophies.

00:10:45.330 --> 00:10:49.080 align:middle line:84%
So being philosophically and
also physically expansive

00:10:49.080 --> 00:10:50.830 align:middle line:90%
is important to them.

00:10:50.830 --> 00:10:53.620 align:middle line:84%
And as they grow
older, every generation

00:10:53.620 --> 00:10:57.790 align:middle line:84%
has an imprint that they'll
bring to the collective milieu,

00:10:57.790 --> 00:11:00.050 align:middle line:90%
and theirs will be expansion.

00:11:00.050 --> 00:11:04.220 align:middle line:84%
So one of the things that we
might see with this generation

00:11:04.220 --> 00:11:09.850 align:middle line:84%
is actually expanding beyond the
confines of the Earth itself,

00:11:09.850 --> 00:11:11.880 align:middle line:90%
going beyond gravity.

00:11:11.880 --> 00:11:12.880 align:middle line:90%
They're great minds.

00:11:12.880 --> 00:11:14.984 align:middle line:84%
And as we're going to
see here, the last time

00:11:14.984 --> 00:11:17.150 align:middle line:84%
that Pluto was in Sagittarius--
this is a little bit

00:11:17.150 --> 00:11:19.070 align:middle line:84%
later-- last time Pluto
was in Sagittarius

00:11:19.070 --> 00:11:21.390 align:middle line:84%
was just before the
American Revolution.

00:11:21.390 --> 00:11:24.980 align:middle line:84%
And in fact, the Pluto
in Sagittarius thinkers

00:11:24.980 --> 00:11:28.100 align:middle line:84%
and culture movers and
shapers and the philosophers

00:11:28.100 --> 00:11:30.920 align:middle line:84%
were the ones that
were planting the seeds

00:11:30.920 --> 00:11:32.710 align:middle line:90%
for the American Revolution.

00:11:32.710 --> 00:11:37.740 align:middle line:84%
So these kids have within
them that kind of spark.

00:11:37.740 --> 00:11:41.140 align:middle line:84%
Plus you have Uranus in
Aquarius, Neptune in Aquarius.

00:11:41.140 --> 00:11:44.520 align:middle line:84%
It's going to give them a really
forward-thinking and much more

00:11:44.520 --> 00:11:48.710 align:middle line:84%
inclusive kind of perspective
than almost any generation

00:11:48.710 --> 00:11:50.042 align:middle line:90%
before them.

00:11:50.042 --> 00:11:51.750 align:middle line:84%
They're going to be
deeply philosophical.

00:11:51.750 --> 00:11:55.060 align:middle line:84%
They're going to wonder
about life, wonder about God,

00:11:55.060 --> 00:11:56.140 align:middle line:90%
wonder about existence.

00:11:56.140 --> 00:12:00.320 align:middle line:84%
Now Sagittarius can also
be very paradoxical,

00:12:00.320 --> 00:12:04.230 align:middle line:90%
and they can be great heretics.

00:12:04.230 --> 00:12:06.710 align:middle line:84%
I would say one of the
archetypal Sagittarian

00:12:06.710 --> 00:12:10.110 align:middle line:84%
personas of the 20th
century is Jim Morrison,

00:12:10.110 --> 00:12:14.120 align:middle line:84%
and Jim Morrison was both,
in some ways, kind of sacred

00:12:14.120 --> 00:12:16.420 align:middle line:90%
and profane at the same time.

00:12:16.420 --> 00:12:19.770 align:middle line:84%
He had a really strong
kind of shamanic presence

00:12:19.770 --> 00:12:24.420 align:middle line:84%
and was, in his own way, devoted
to some form of revelation

00:12:24.420 --> 00:12:26.310 align:middle line:90%
of truth through art.

00:12:26.310 --> 00:12:30.500 align:middle line:84%
But at the same time, he also
had a very profound disdain

00:12:30.500 --> 00:12:34.540 align:middle line:84%
for the predominant culture,
even though his father, Douglas

00:12:34.540 --> 00:12:37.300 align:middle line:84%
Morrison, was one
of the architects

00:12:37.300 --> 00:12:39.470 align:middle line:84%
and the progenitors
of the Vietnam War.

00:12:39.470 --> 00:12:42.120 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't come out
very often, but he

00:12:42.120 --> 00:12:45.230 align:middle line:84%
was engaged in the Gulf
of Tonkin incident.

00:12:45.230 --> 00:12:48.640 align:middle line:84%
So Jim Morrison
is the son of one

00:12:48.640 --> 00:12:50.140 align:middle line:84%
of the architects
of the Vietnam War

00:12:50.140 --> 00:12:52.050 align:middle line:84%
and, in fact, lived
in Washington,

00:12:52.050 --> 00:12:57.640 align:middle line:84%
DC and went to kindergarten with
Gail Sloatman, who later became

00:12:57.640 --> 00:12:59.320 align:middle line:84%
the wife of Frank
Zappa, a little bit

00:12:59.320 --> 00:13:01.930 align:middle line:84%
of rock and roll
trivia for you there.

00:13:01.930 --> 00:13:03.590 align:middle line:90%
So they're deeply philosophical.

00:13:03.590 --> 00:13:04.650 align:middle line:90%
They're risk-takers.

00:13:04.650 --> 00:13:06.210 align:middle line:90%
We've already talked about that.

00:13:06.210 --> 00:13:08.050 align:middle line:90%
Sagittarius is paradoxical.

00:13:08.050 --> 00:13:12.230 align:middle line:84%
They will go to extremes
to find and understand

00:13:12.230 --> 00:13:14.290 align:middle line:90%
the truth in some ways.

00:13:14.290 --> 00:13:16.310 align:middle line:84%
And in fact, William
Blake, who we're

00:13:16.310 --> 00:13:18.550 align:middle line:84%
going to look at
in a moment here,

00:13:18.550 --> 00:13:21.420 align:middle line:84%
he has one of the great
aphorisms of all time when

00:13:21.420 --> 00:13:26.960 align:middle line:84%
it comes extremes, which is
"the roads of excess lead

00:13:26.960 --> 00:13:30.950 align:middle line:84%
to the palace of wisdom" a very
Sagittarian kind of philosophy

00:13:30.950 --> 00:13:31.880 align:middle line:90%
there.

00:13:31.880 --> 00:13:35.137 align:middle line:84%
They can be
conventionally moral.

00:13:35.137 --> 00:13:36.720 align:middle line:84%
So this is going to
be very different.

00:13:36.720 --> 00:13:39.130 align:middle line:84%
They're going to be very
different, in a lot of ways,

00:13:39.130 --> 00:13:42.660 align:middle line:84%
than their Pluto in Scorpio
predecessors who are,

00:13:42.660 --> 00:13:44.330 align:middle line:90%
in some ways, very amoral.

00:13:44.330 --> 00:13:47.710 align:middle line:84%
They'll do whatever they want,
whatever they need in order

00:13:47.710 --> 00:13:51.340 align:middle line:84%
to have that dynamic
hit on their psyche

00:13:51.340 --> 00:13:53.050 align:middle line:84%
and their psychological
experience

00:13:53.050 --> 00:13:55.010 align:middle line:90%
and their spiritual experience.

00:13:55.010 --> 00:13:58.630 align:middle line:84%
And as a result, we see
this sometimes with Pluto

00:13:58.630 --> 00:14:02.270 align:middle line:84%
in generations, and they'll kind
of flip-flop on one another.

00:14:02.270 --> 00:14:04.795 align:middle line:84%
They'll have one wave come
in, like Pluto in Leo,

00:14:04.795 --> 00:14:07.617 align:middle line:84%
and be gregarious and
big and larger than life,

00:14:07.617 --> 00:14:09.450 align:middle line:84%
and then they'll have
Pluto in Virgo come in

00:14:09.450 --> 00:14:12.500 align:middle line:84%
and scale it down a bit
and bring it back and get

00:14:12.500 --> 00:14:14.540 align:middle line:90%
more grounded, more real.

00:14:14.540 --> 00:14:17.220 align:middle line:84%
And so we see this
get worked out

00:14:17.220 --> 00:14:24.050 align:middle line:84%
through the evolution of
the procession of Pluto

00:14:24.050 --> 00:14:26.670 align:middle line:84%
through the various signs
and through generations.

00:14:26.670 --> 00:14:30.390 align:middle line:84%
So the Pluto in
Sagittarius kids, I think,

00:14:30.390 --> 00:14:33.570 align:middle line:84%
have the potential to be much
more conventionally moral

00:14:33.570 --> 00:14:35.370 align:middle line:90%
than the Pluto in Scorpio kids.

00:14:35.370 --> 00:14:37.290 align:middle line:84%
So I think what
we're going to see

00:14:37.290 --> 00:14:42.790 align:middle line:84%
as they get older is a
turning away at some point

00:14:42.790 --> 00:14:47.030 align:middle line:84%
from what I would call the
deeply illuminated culture

00:14:47.030 --> 00:14:48.590 align:middle line:90%
that we're living in right now.

00:14:48.590 --> 00:14:51.760 align:middle line:84%
And as a result, I
also think you're

00:14:51.760 --> 00:14:54.620 align:middle line:84%
going to see them become
more religiously oriented.

00:14:54.620 --> 00:14:57.320 align:middle line:84%
Now that could manifest
in traditional religions,

00:14:57.320 --> 00:14:59.910 align:middle line:84%
traditional Christianity,
traditional Islam.

00:14:59.910 --> 00:15:03.670 align:middle line:84%
Whatever kind of more
orthodox religion

00:15:03.670 --> 00:15:06.040 align:middle line:84%
we're talking about here,
Pluto in Sagittarius,

00:15:06.040 --> 00:15:10.310 align:middle line:84%
once they've kind of gone
through their cynicism

00:15:10.310 --> 00:15:12.310 align:middle line:84%
in some ways-- because
they can also be cynical.

00:15:12.310 --> 00:15:14.470 align:middle line:84%
Sagittarius can be quite
a cynical sign as well--

00:15:14.470 --> 00:15:17.470 align:middle line:84%
but once they get
through the cynicism

00:15:17.470 --> 00:15:20.180 align:middle line:84%
and reclaim their
faith, they can

00:15:20.180 --> 00:15:23.882 align:middle line:84%
become deeply religious
and religiously oriented.

00:15:23.882 --> 00:15:24.590 align:middle line:90%
They're spirited.

00:15:24.590 --> 00:15:26.260 align:middle line:90%
They have a lot of energy.

00:15:26.260 --> 00:15:29.299 align:middle line:84%
They have a lot of
drive and verve,

00:15:29.299 --> 00:15:31.840 align:middle line:84%
and not drive in the sense that
maybe Pluto in Capricorn kids

00:15:31.840 --> 00:15:36.070 align:middle line:84%
will have, but drive to
experience life, joie de vivre,

00:15:36.070 --> 00:15:38.490 align:middle line:90%
as the French would say.

00:15:38.490 --> 00:15:44.640 align:middle line:84%
And there's also an aspect
here of potential zealotry.

00:15:44.640 --> 00:15:47.460 align:middle line:84%
Because of all the
signs, Sagittarius

00:15:47.460 --> 00:15:49.220 align:middle line:90%
is the most zealous.

00:15:49.220 --> 00:15:53.800 align:middle line:84%
They can be the sign that can
be most judgmental in some ways.

00:15:53.800 --> 00:15:56.350 align:middle line:84%
They can be so convinced
that they are right,

00:15:56.350 --> 00:15:58.050 align:middle line:84%
either philosophically
or religiously

00:15:58.050 --> 00:16:02.850 align:middle line:84%
or politically, that they own
that to a degree that is, well,

00:16:02.850 --> 00:16:05.480 align:middle line:84%
a lot of people might
find to be judgmental.

00:16:05.480 --> 00:16:10.590 align:middle line:84%
So this is a generation that
has the seed of zealotry

00:16:10.590 --> 00:16:11.730 align:middle line:90%
planted in it.

00:16:11.730 --> 00:16:15.584 align:middle line:84%
Now this is important to
understand as we move forward

00:16:15.584 --> 00:16:17.000 align:middle line:84%
and we look at
"The Hunger Games,"

00:16:17.000 --> 00:16:19.750 align:middle line:84%
we look at "Divergent,"
and a few other things that

00:16:19.750 --> 00:16:22.280 align:middle line:84%
are on the horizon
for this generation.

00:16:22.280 --> 00:16:23.667 align:middle line:90%
And lastly--

00:16:23.667 --> 00:16:25.250 align:middle line:84%
Breaking down
traditional educational.

00:16:25.250 --> 00:16:27.330 align:middle line:90%
We've already covered that.

00:16:27.330 --> 00:16:29.610 align:middle line:90%
Lastly, they're very inventive.

00:16:29.610 --> 00:16:32.700 align:middle line:84%
This is a generation that
will invent great things.

00:16:32.700 --> 00:16:36.620 align:middle line:84%
And in fact, I read a piece
the other day on Yahoo!

00:16:36.620 --> 00:16:39.890 align:middle line:84%
about a 13-year-old who'd
made his own nuclear reactor.

00:16:39.890 --> 00:16:40.670 align:middle line:90%
I kid you not.

00:16:40.670 --> 00:16:43.470 align:middle line:84%
This is a Pluto in
Sagittarius kid.

00:16:43.470 --> 00:16:45.640 align:middle line:84%
So this is what we have
to look forward to,

00:16:45.640 --> 00:16:48.640 align:middle line:84%
and especially now because
Uranus is in Aries.

00:16:48.640 --> 00:16:50.920 align:middle line:84%
And as Uranus moves
through the sign of Aries,

00:16:50.920 --> 00:16:52.930 align:middle line:84%
it's going to trine,
begin to trine.

00:16:52.930 --> 00:16:55.460 align:middle line:84%
It's already trining right
now the early degrees of Pluto

00:16:55.460 --> 00:16:56.370 align:middle line:90%
in Sagittarius.

00:16:56.370 --> 00:16:58.505 align:middle line:84%
So these kids are
going through not only

00:16:58.505 --> 00:17:02.600 align:middle line:84%
a philosophical awakening but
a cosmic awakening as well.

00:17:02.600 --> 00:17:06.819 align:middle line:84%
The seed of the future lies
within this generation.

00:17:06.819 --> 00:17:10.510 align:middle line:84%
So their first point
of generational crisis

00:17:10.510 --> 00:17:13.010 align:middle line:90%
is going to be December of 2014.

00:17:13.010 --> 00:17:15.960 align:middle line:84%
That's when Saturn moves
into the sign of Sagittarius.

00:17:15.960 --> 00:17:19.339 align:middle line:84%
It'll be leaving Scorpio
and moving into Sagittarius.

00:17:19.339 --> 00:17:21.740 align:middle line:84%
And what we'll see
here is we'll see

00:17:21.740 --> 00:17:25.240 align:middle line:84%
Saturn hit the first
degrees of Pluto,

00:17:25.240 --> 00:17:29.200 align:middle line:84%
so it'll be that first wave
of Pluto in Sagittarius kids.

00:17:29.200 --> 00:17:31.550 align:middle line:84%
And what will happen
is is we're going

00:17:31.550 --> 00:17:35.920 align:middle line:84%
to see and witness with
them and through them

00:17:35.920 --> 00:17:39.720 align:middle line:84%
physical and
spiritual limitation.

00:17:39.720 --> 00:17:43.380 align:middle line:84%
Because based upon what
I'm seeing with Saturn

00:17:43.380 --> 00:17:45.880 align:middle line:84%
in Sagittarius,
Sagittarius rules law.

00:17:45.880 --> 00:17:49.510 align:middle line:84%
And when Saturn comes into
play and you combine the two--

00:17:49.510 --> 00:17:52.100 align:middle line:84%
by the way, Sagittarius
is in its fall

00:17:52.100 --> 00:17:54.800 align:middle line:84%
with Saturn-- we
have in some ways

00:17:54.800 --> 00:17:59.310 align:middle line:84%
the lesser expression or the
lesser manifestation of law,

00:17:59.310 --> 00:18:01.720 align:middle line:84%
not a type of law
that would expand.

00:18:01.720 --> 00:18:03.380 align:middle line:84%
That would be Jupiter
in Sagittarius,

00:18:03.380 --> 00:18:06.100 align:middle line:84%
and that would give us
kind of a cosmic law

00:18:06.100 --> 00:18:09.050 align:middle line:84%
or a natural law
or a common law.

00:18:09.050 --> 00:18:12.280 align:middle line:84%
Saturn in Sagittarius
will be the imposition

00:18:12.280 --> 00:18:16.800 align:middle line:84%
of law in a way that would
have a lot more gravity,

00:18:16.800 --> 00:18:20.400 align:middle line:84%
a lot more pressure, and a
lot more inertia associated

00:18:20.400 --> 00:18:21.180 align:middle line:90%
with it.

00:18:21.180 --> 00:18:24.390 align:middle line:84%
So just by Saturn
going into Sagittarius,

00:18:24.390 --> 00:18:26.940 align:middle line:84%
what we're going to
see is we're going

00:18:26.940 --> 00:18:29.780 align:middle line:90%
to see restrictions of freedoms.

00:18:29.780 --> 00:18:31.180 align:middle line:90%
That's what Saturn does.

00:18:31.180 --> 00:18:32.450 align:middle line:90%
It restricts.

00:18:32.450 --> 00:18:35.470 align:middle line:84%
Sagittarius is about
expansiveness and about

00:18:35.470 --> 00:18:37.220 align:middle line:90%
the quality of freedom.

00:18:37.220 --> 00:18:39.490 align:middle line:84%
And what's going to
happen is that Saturn

00:18:39.490 --> 00:18:41.990 align:middle line:84%
is going to be like a
vice grip on Sagittarius.

00:18:41.990 --> 00:18:45.790 align:middle line:84%
So we're going to see this
from a collective level.

00:18:45.790 --> 00:18:47.590 align:middle line:90%
It's just the way of things.

00:18:47.590 --> 00:18:49.250 align:middle line:84%
Because what's
happening is we're

00:18:49.250 --> 00:18:52.260 align:middle line:84%
seeing so much in our culture
right now and around the world

00:18:52.260 --> 00:18:57.390 align:middle line:84%
where people have had 24/7
exposure on the internet

00:18:57.390 --> 00:19:00.050 align:middle line:84%
since the mid
'90s, and there are

00:19:00.050 --> 00:19:03.520 align:middle line:84%
a lot of things that
people are discovering,

00:19:03.520 --> 00:19:05.020 align:middle line:84%
a lot of revelations
and epiphanies

00:19:05.020 --> 00:19:06.960 align:middle line:84%
that people are
having, and their eyes

00:19:06.960 --> 00:19:09.570 align:middle line:84%
are being opened to what's
going on in the world.

00:19:09.570 --> 00:19:13.010 align:middle line:84%
And as a result of this, there
will be more contraction,

00:19:13.010 --> 00:19:15.350 align:middle line:84%
more constriction,
and more gravity.

00:19:15.350 --> 00:19:20.150 align:middle line:84%
More laws will be put in place
as people become more awake.

00:19:20.150 --> 00:19:22.820 align:middle line:90%
It's just the nature of things.

00:19:22.820 --> 00:19:24.490 align:middle line:90%
So what is the potential?

00:19:24.490 --> 00:19:27.350 align:middle line:84%
What are the potential
outcomes or a potential outcome

00:19:27.350 --> 00:19:28.109 align:middle line:90%
for this?

00:19:28.109 --> 00:19:29.650 align:middle line:84%
Well, potentially
we could be looking

00:19:29.650 --> 00:19:32.945 align:middle line:84%
at a conscription and a
draft, maybe the first one

00:19:32.945 --> 00:19:36.240 align:middle line:84%
in years, because the
Pluto in Sagittarian kids

00:19:36.240 --> 00:19:39.692 align:middle line:84%
are used to being, in
some ways, free and open.

00:19:39.692 --> 00:19:41.410 align:middle line:90%
That's their nature, right?

00:19:41.410 --> 00:19:46.200 align:middle line:84%
And so if we have a
conscription and a draft,

00:19:46.200 --> 00:19:48.700 align:middle line:90%
will we have a call to war?

00:19:48.700 --> 00:19:50.940 align:middle line:84%
And well, we're right on
the brink of war right now

00:19:50.940 --> 00:19:55.225 align:middle line:84%
with Ukraine and Russia
and who knows who else

00:19:55.225 --> 00:19:59.390 align:middle line:84%
in the theater over
there in the Balkans.

00:19:59.390 --> 00:20:02.440 align:middle line:84%
So that's sort of in the
atmosphere right now.

00:20:02.440 --> 00:20:06.189 align:middle line:84%
And we're talking
December of 2014.

00:20:06.189 --> 00:20:07.980 align:middle line:84%
I don't want to be a
prognosticator of doom

00:20:07.980 --> 00:20:11.030 align:middle line:84%
and gloom, but we're looking
at a potential timeline here.

00:20:11.030 --> 00:20:19.152 align:middle line:84%
And remember, "Divergent"
opens on-- it's 3/21.

00:20:19.152 --> 00:20:19.860 align:middle line:90%
I made a mistake.

00:20:19.860 --> 00:20:26.320 align:middle line:84%
It is 3/21 at the beginning
of the Aries, 3/21/2014.

00:20:26.320 --> 00:20:28.520 align:middle line:84%
So that's the sign of
the warrior, right?

00:20:28.520 --> 00:20:29.020 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:20:29.020 --> 00:20:32.710 align:middle line:84%
So 9/11 occurred when
Pluto was at 12 Sag.

00:20:32.710 --> 00:20:33.710 align:middle line:90%
Remember that.

00:20:33.710 --> 00:20:37.370 align:middle line:84%
9/11 occurred when Pluto
was at 12 Sagittarius.

00:20:37.370 --> 00:20:43.980 align:middle line:84%
Saturn will be at 12 Sagittarius
on the 9th of January in 2016.

00:20:43.980 --> 00:20:48.560 align:middle line:84%
So what we have here is we
have the potential of Saturn

00:20:48.560 --> 00:20:52.740 align:middle line:84%
to come right onto
that degree of Pluto

00:20:52.740 --> 00:20:54.970 align:middle line:84%
where we experienced
9/11, and there

00:20:54.970 --> 00:21:00.267 align:middle line:84%
could be a really profound
revelation of truth

00:21:00.267 --> 00:21:00.975 align:middle line:90%
during that time.

00:21:00.975 --> 00:21:02.580 align:middle line:90%
Something--

00:21:02.580 --> 00:21:06.100 align:middle line:84%
And we can back this
off about three degrees

00:21:06.100 --> 00:21:10.950 align:middle line:84%
and go back to the latter
part of December in 2015,

00:21:10.950 --> 00:21:14.530 align:middle line:84%
where we can see Saturn begin
to come into orb with Pluto.

00:21:14.530 --> 00:21:17.540 align:middle line:84%
And I guarantee you you're
going to hear chatter,

00:21:17.540 --> 00:21:19.400 align:middle line:84%
you're going to see
things on the internet,

00:21:19.400 --> 00:21:21.695 align:middle line:84%
you're going to hear
things on the news that

00:21:21.695 --> 00:21:25.560 align:middle line:84%
are going to be about
either some new revelation

00:21:25.560 --> 00:21:29.780 align:middle line:84%
around 9/11, people calling
for another investigation.

00:21:29.780 --> 00:21:34.440 align:middle line:84%
It's feeling to me that this
Saturn transit getting close

00:21:34.440 --> 00:21:39.230 align:middle line:84%
to Pluto will represent
some form of critical mass,

00:21:39.230 --> 00:21:41.840 align:middle line:84%
because we're going
back in time and we're

00:21:41.840 --> 00:21:45.390 align:middle line:84%
bringing Saturn and
Sagittarius, law,

00:21:45.390 --> 00:21:48.590 align:middle line:84%
around this whole
experience around 9/11.

00:21:48.590 --> 00:21:50.680 align:middle line:84%
So if that's the
case and we haven't

00:21:50.680 --> 00:21:52.780 align:middle line:84%
had some form of
global conflict,

00:21:52.780 --> 00:21:55.880 align:middle line:84%
god forbid, in Ukraine
and the Balkans

00:21:55.880 --> 00:21:59.540 align:middle line:84%
and that region
around Russia, then

00:21:59.540 --> 00:22:04.870 align:middle line:84%
if this is happening right
around the 9th of January

00:22:04.870 --> 00:22:09.640 align:middle line:84%
in 2016, then my
feeling is that there

00:22:09.640 --> 00:22:12.170 align:middle line:84%
would be other things
happening in the world

00:22:12.170 --> 00:22:15.830 align:middle line:84%
to take us away from
experiencing that revelation

00:22:15.830 --> 00:22:18.410 align:middle line:84%
or experiencing that quote,
unquote "collective moment

00:22:18.410 --> 00:22:19.600 align:middle line:90%
of truth."

00:22:19.600 --> 00:22:22.884 align:middle line:84%
So Sagittarius equals
truth, and Pluto brings it

00:22:22.884 --> 00:22:23.550 align:middle line:90%
from the depths.

00:22:23.550 --> 00:22:26.130 align:middle line:84%
And here we have a
graphic down below.

00:22:26.130 --> 00:22:30.140 align:middle line:84%
It's all about building
number 7 and the quote,

00:22:30.140 --> 00:22:32.890 align:middle line:84%
unquote "truthers" that are
still out there around 9/11.

00:22:32.890 --> 00:22:36.280 align:middle line:84%
So this is a really important
degree, an important time,

00:22:36.280 --> 00:22:38.210 align:middle line:84%
and it could potentially
impact the Pluto

00:22:38.210 --> 00:22:39.800 align:middle line:84%
in Sagittarius
people, young people.

00:22:39.800 --> 00:22:40.364 align:middle line:90%
All right.

00:22:40.364 --> 00:22:41.280 align:middle line:90%
So let's move on here.

00:22:41.280 --> 00:22:44.040 align:middle line:84%
These are some personages
from the last time

00:22:44.040 --> 00:22:45.660 align:middle line:90%
Pluto was in Sagittarius.

00:22:45.660 --> 00:22:50.070 align:middle line:84%
This is Goethe, who was born at
0 degrees Pluto in Sagittarius,

00:22:50.070 --> 00:22:52.110 align:middle line:84%
one of the great
minds of all time,

00:22:52.110 --> 00:22:55.410 align:middle line:84%
purportedly had
an IQ of over 200

00:22:55.410 --> 00:22:59.490 align:middle line:84%
and might have been one of the
founders of the Priory of Sion

00:22:59.490 --> 00:22:59.990 align:middle line:90%
as well.

00:22:59.990 --> 00:23:01.690 align:middle line:90%
Great philosopher.

00:23:01.690 --> 00:23:05.330 align:middle line:84%
Here we have Mozart, another
Pluto in Sagittarius persona.

00:23:05.330 --> 00:23:06.780 align:middle line:90%
He was an Aquarius.

00:23:06.780 --> 00:23:09.410 align:middle line:84%
So if you wanted to
look at, in some ways,

00:23:09.410 --> 00:23:12.800 align:middle line:84%
a manifestation of Uranus
in Aquarius and Neptune

00:23:12.800 --> 00:23:15.930 align:middle line:84%
in Aquarius with Pluto in
Sagittarius on the side,

00:23:15.930 --> 00:23:18.520 align:middle line:84%
maybe you could look at Mozart,
because he was an Aquarius,

00:23:18.520 --> 00:23:20.910 align:middle line:84%
he was born under
Pluto in Sagittarius,

00:23:20.910 --> 00:23:26.070 align:middle line:84%
so we have this really
explosive creative individual

00:23:26.070 --> 00:23:31.000 align:middle line:84%
whose art is almost
unsurpassed in many ways,

00:23:31.000 --> 00:23:33.200 align:middle line:90%
and also a child prodigy.

00:23:33.200 --> 00:23:34.780 align:middle line:84%
So I would not be
surprised if we

00:23:34.780 --> 00:23:37.230 align:middle line:84%
start to see more child
prodigies with Pluto

00:23:37.230 --> 00:23:39.274 align:middle line:90%
in Sagittarius as well.

00:23:39.274 --> 00:23:41.090 align:middle line:90%
Ah, OK.

00:23:41.090 --> 00:23:43.350 align:middle line:84%
This is James Freeman,
and James Freeman

00:23:43.350 --> 00:23:45.560 align:middle line:84%
is the founder of
the Unitarian Church.

00:23:45.560 --> 00:23:48.630 align:middle line:84%
And the reason why I
put him in this mix

00:23:48.630 --> 00:23:51.350 align:middle line:84%
is because he is a
religious reformer,

00:23:51.350 --> 00:23:53.710 align:middle line:84%
and we're going to see some
religious reforms in Pluto

00:23:53.710 --> 00:23:58.000 align:middle line:84%
in Sagittarius as well
with their generation.

00:23:58.000 --> 00:24:00.710 align:middle line:84%
And James Freeman is an
interesting character

00:24:00.710 --> 00:24:04.630 align:middle line:84%
because he broke with
the traditional belief

00:24:04.630 --> 00:24:07.610 align:middle line:84%
that there was a Trinity,
a father, and a son,

00:24:07.610 --> 00:24:09.020 align:middle line:90%
and a Holy Ghost.

00:24:09.020 --> 00:24:11.960 align:middle line:84%
He just said, no,
it's God the Father,

00:24:11.960 --> 00:24:13.950 align:middle line:84%
and God the Father
is in everything.

00:24:13.950 --> 00:24:16.820 align:middle line:84%
And he also believed
that Jesus did not

00:24:16.820 --> 00:24:19.810 align:middle line:84%
have an a priori
experience, meaning

00:24:19.810 --> 00:24:22.340 align:middle line:84%
that in traditional
Catholicism, or even

00:24:22.340 --> 00:24:27.440 align:middle line:84%
some forms of Protestantism,
that Jesus had an experience

00:24:27.440 --> 00:24:31.000 align:middle line:84%
before he was the Son of God,
that there was a Jesus that

00:24:31.000 --> 00:24:35.510 align:middle line:84%
predated that manifestation
and incarnation of Jesus.

00:24:35.510 --> 00:24:38.130 align:middle line:84%
And in James Freeman's
world, that was not the case.

00:24:38.130 --> 00:24:41.000 align:middle line:84%
James Freeman
believed that Jesus

00:24:41.000 --> 00:24:45.810 align:middle line:84%
was born as the Son of God and
did not exist prior to that.

00:24:45.810 --> 00:24:47.680 align:middle line:84%
So he's a really
influential figure

00:24:47.680 --> 00:24:51.720 align:middle line:84%
in terms of religion and
philosophy, born April 22,

00:24:51.720 --> 00:24:54.037 align:middle line:84%
so we've got a little
master number mix in there.

00:24:54.037 --> 00:24:55.620 align:middle line:84%
And I just wanted
to bring him in here

00:24:55.620 --> 00:24:57.720 align:middle line:84%
to show you how
Pluto in Sagittarius

00:24:57.720 --> 00:25:00.450 align:middle line:90%
transforms religion.

00:25:00.450 --> 00:25:03.990 align:middle line:84%
Here's Betsy Ross, also born
under Pluto in Sagittarius.

00:25:03.990 --> 00:25:06.150 align:middle line:84%
The flag is kind of
an interesting symbol,

00:25:06.150 --> 00:25:07.410 align:middle line:90%
as we'll see.

00:25:07.410 --> 00:25:10.700 align:middle line:84%
And again, I
wouldn't say there's

00:25:10.700 --> 00:25:13.830 align:middle line:84%
a form of a zealotry
involved here, but certainly

00:25:13.830 --> 00:25:17.580 align:middle line:84%
a devotion to a cause, which is
another thing that will be sort

00:25:17.580 --> 00:25:21.050 align:middle line:84%
of endemic of the Pluto
in Sagittarius kids.

00:25:21.050 --> 00:25:27.110 align:middle line:84%
Here's Marie Antoinette, another
Pluto in Sagittarius person.

00:25:27.110 --> 00:25:29.830 align:middle line:90%
This is Mary Wollstonecraft.

00:25:29.830 --> 00:25:32.900 align:middle line:84%
Pretty interesting, she's the
mother of Mary Wollstonecraft

00:25:32.900 --> 00:25:36.780 align:middle line:84%
Shelley, who will go on to write
"Frankenstein," which is really

00:25:36.780 --> 00:25:39.490 align:middle line:84%
the first novel
about transhumanism,

00:25:39.490 --> 00:25:41.010 align:middle line:90%
believe it or not.

00:25:41.010 --> 00:25:43.650 align:middle line:84%
So Mary Wollstonecraft
is also noted

00:25:43.650 --> 00:25:45.820 align:middle line:90%
as being the first feminist.

00:25:45.820 --> 00:25:47.940 align:middle line:84%
She wrote a number of
tracts and treatises

00:25:47.940 --> 00:25:51.840 align:middle line:84%
on the right, the
natural rights of women.

00:25:51.840 --> 00:25:54.450 align:middle line:84%
And one of her admirers who
was secretly in love with her

00:25:54.450 --> 00:25:55.240 align:middle line:90%
was this man.

00:25:55.240 --> 00:25:59.260 align:middle line:84%
This is William Blake, also
born under Pluto in Sagittarius.

00:25:59.260 --> 00:26:02.210 align:middle line:84%
And Blake is one of my
favorite philosophers and poets

00:26:02.210 --> 00:26:04.835 align:middle line:84%
of all time, and he's
also a Sagittarius.

00:26:04.835 --> 00:26:08.060 align:middle line:84%
So he's a Sagittarius
with Pluto in Sagittarius.

00:26:08.060 --> 00:26:10.780 align:middle line:84%
And one of the things
that Blake said

00:26:10.780 --> 00:26:14.890 align:middle line:84%
was that his art would be
discovered and appreciated

00:26:14.890 --> 00:26:17.340 align:middle line:90%
by a future generation.

00:26:17.340 --> 00:26:20.600 align:middle line:84%
And in some ways,
some people think

00:26:20.600 --> 00:26:23.830 align:middle line:84%
that that future generation
was the '60s generation,

00:26:23.830 --> 00:26:26.180 align:middle line:84%
for instance Jim Morrison,
Sagittarius again,

00:26:26.180 --> 00:26:29.550 align:middle line:84%
who named his band
after William Blake, who

00:26:29.550 --> 00:26:32.030 align:middle line:84%
wrote when the doors of
perception our cleansed,

00:26:32.030 --> 00:26:35.950 align:middle line:84%
then we would see all things
as they are, infinite.

00:26:35.950 --> 00:26:40.980 align:middle line:84%
And that was lifted
from Blake by Huxley,

00:26:40.980 --> 00:26:44.660 align:middle line:84%
who wrote the book about his
own hallucinatory experiences

00:26:44.660 --> 00:26:47.090 align:middle line:84%
called "The Doors of
Perception," and then,

00:26:47.090 --> 00:26:51.730 align:middle line:84%
of course, Jim Morrison used
the name The Doors for short

00:26:51.730 --> 00:26:53.280 align:middle line:90%
for his band.

00:26:53.280 --> 00:26:56.890 align:middle line:84%
So I think, though, that the
generation that William Blake

00:26:56.890 --> 00:26:59.740 align:middle line:84%
is talking about is the Pluto
in Sagittarius generation.

00:26:59.740 --> 00:27:01.390 align:middle line:84%
I think they'll
discover William Blake,

00:27:01.390 --> 00:27:04.240 align:middle line:84%
and they will be
the generation that

00:27:04.240 --> 00:27:08.084 align:middle line:84%
lives with this whole notion
and concept of imagination.

00:27:08.084 --> 00:27:09.500 align:middle line:84%
And what we're
seeing right now is

00:27:09.500 --> 00:27:12.890 align:middle line:84%
that the Pluto in Scorpio kids
are deeply into experience,

00:27:12.890 --> 00:27:14.370 align:middle line:90%
really into experience.

00:27:14.370 --> 00:27:17.220 align:middle line:84%
So in the Blake cosmology,
it's innocence, experience,

00:27:17.220 --> 00:27:20.160 align:middle line:84%
and imagination, and it's the
Pluto in Sagittarius kids,

00:27:20.160 --> 00:27:22.690 align:middle line:84%
I think, that have
a shot, a real shot,

00:27:22.690 --> 00:27:26.250 align:middle line:84%
at living a truly
imaginative life.

00:27:26.250 --> 00:27:28.630 align:middle line:84%
And when you have a
strong imagination

00:27:28.630 --> 00:27:30.856 align:middle line:84%
or you have the
potential to live

00:27:30.856 --> 00:27:31.980 align:middle line:90%
with a strong imagination--

00:27:31.980 --> 00:27:34.040 align:middle line:84%
What Blake means by
that, by the way,

00:27:34.040 --> 00:27:35.930 align:middle line:84%
is he's not talking
about fancy, which

00:27:35.930 --> 00:27:37.250 align:middle line:90%
is something very different.

00:27:37.250 --> 00:27:41.090 align:middle line:84%
He's talking about the
ability to create your world

00:27:41.090 --> 00:27:45.200 align:middle line:84%
in a way that is creative,
rich, and imaginative, in a way

00:27:45.200 --> 00:27:46.930 align:middle line:90%
to create your own system.

00:27:46.930 --> 00:27:49.660 align:middle line:84%
And Sagittarians are
into systems as well.

00:27:49.660 --> 00:27:53.550 align:middle line:84%
And Blake's famous quote is "I
shall create a system of my own

00:27:53.550 --> 00:27:57.610 align:middle line:84%
or be enslaved by
another-- by another's."

00:27:57.610 --> 00:27:59.430 align:middle line:90%
He uses its plural.

00:27:59.430 --> 00:28:02.855 align:middle line:84%
So this is going to be kind
of the mantra for the Pluto

00:28:02.855 --> 00:28:04.880 align:middle line:84%
in Sagittarius
generation as well,

00:28:04.880 --> 00:28:06.980 align:middle line:90%
creating their own systems.

00:28:06.980 --> 00:28:09.320 align:middle line:84%
Now here we have
a watershed event

00:28:09.320 --> 00:28:11.280 align:middle line:84%
which took place
when Pluto really

00:28:11.280 --> 00:28:13.290 align:middle line:84%
just went into Pluto
in Sagittarius.

00:28:13.290 --> 00:28:16.340 align:middle line:84%
This is the Olympic
Village in Atlanta.

00:28:16.340 --> 00:28:20.310 align:middle line:84%
This is just after the bombing
in the Olympic Village.

00:28:20.310 --> 00:28:22.620 align:middle line:84%
And by the way, I
think this is the day

00:28:22.620 --> 00:28:25.441 align:middle line:84%
after, because that bombing
happened at night time,

00:28:25.441 --> 00:28:26.190 align:middle line:90%
believe it or not.

00:28:26.190 --> 00:28:29.230 align:middle line:90%
And I was just blocks from this.

00:28:29.230 --> 00:28:34.230 align:middle line:84%
Just before it went off, I was
reading tarot cards in Atlanta

00:28:34.230 --> 00:28:35.440 align:middle line:90%
at the Olympics.

00:28:35.440 --> 00:28:36.420 align:middle line:90%
I'd had a great day.

00:28:36.420 --> 00:28:37.630 align:middle line:90%
It was a Friday night.

00:28:37.630 --> 00:28:40.150 align:middle line:84%
I packed up, and
I left that area,

00:28:40.150 --> 00:28:41.910 align:middle line:84%
and I was about two
and a half blocks away

00:28:41.910 --> 00:28:42.951 align:middle line:90%
from the Olympic Village.

00:28:42.951 --> 00:28:45.570 align:middle line:84%
And the bomb went off by the
time I got back to my car,

00:28:45.570 --> 00:28:49.790 align:middle line:84%
and I went to a
local restaurant/bar.

00:28:49.790 --> 00:28:51.060 align:middle line:90%
It was all over the news.

00:28:51.060 --> 00:28:54.440 align:middle line:84%
And of course, it had some
really powerful implications,

00:28:54.440 --> 00:28:55.440 align:middle line:90%
especially for this man.

00:28:55.440 --> 00:28:57.050 align:middle line:90%
This is Richard Jewell.

00:28:57.050 --> 00:29:00.930 align:middle line:84%
He's the security guard
that took the fall.

00:29:00.930 --> 00:29:02.960 align:middle line:84%
He took the fall for
the Olympic bombing.

00:29:02.960 --> 00:29:07.460 align:middle line:84%
It took years for him to begin
to clear his name from being

00:29:07.460 --> 00:29:09.240 align:middle line:90%
associated with the bombing.

00:29:09.240 --> 00:29:10.280 align:middle line:90%
He was a security guard.

00:29:10.280 --> 00:29:12.550 align:middle line:84%
He was a guy that was just
trying to help people out.

00:29:12.550 --> 00:29:15.670 align:middle line:84%
And he wound up actually
dying at a fairly young age,

00:29:15.670 --> 00:29:18.850 align:middle line:84%
some people believe due
to the pressure and stress

00:29:18.850 --> 00:29:22.730 align:middle line:84%
that being wrongly accused
around the Olympic bombing

00:29:22.730 --> 00:29:24.280 align:middle line:90%
had caused him.

00:29:24.280 --> 00:29:28.270 align:middle line:84%
Ironically enough, Richard
Jewell is a Sagittarius.

00:29:28.270 --> 00:29:31.020 align:middle line:84%
And of course, the person
who they eventually

00:29:31.020 --> 00:29:34.420 align:middle line:84%
decided that had
done the crime was I

00:29:34.420 --> 00:29:36.180 align:middle line:84%
believe his name
is Eric Mueller,

00:29:36.180 --> 00:29:40.890 align:middle line:84%
and he's now in a
supermax prison.

00:29:40.890 --> 00:29:42.590 align:middle line:84%
Now here's another
image of the flag.

00:29:42.590 --> 00:29:44.320 align:middle line:90%
This is from 9/11.

00:29:44.320 --> 00:29:47.650 align:middle line:84%
And this is, again, a
Pluto in Sagittarius event.

00:29:47.650 --> 00:29:52.290 align:middle line:84%
It happens a few years
after the Olympic bombing.

00:29:52.290 --> 00:29:54.340 align:middle line:84%
But what's interesting
about the Olympic bombing

00:29:54.340 --> 00:29:57.290 align:middle line:84%
is that right after
that, Clinton,

00:29:57.290 --> 00:30:00.820 align:middle line:84%
who was present at that time,
put in the Anti-terrorist

00:30:00.820 --> 00:30:04.560 align:middle line:84%
Act, which was kind of phase
one of the Patriot Act, which

00:30:04.560 --> 00:30:07.905 align:middle line:84%
would follow not long
after that, five years,

00:30:07.905 --> 00:30:08.950 align:middle line:90%
a scant five years.

00:30:08.950 --> 00:30:11.740 align:middle line:84%
So here we see some
first responders,

00:30:11.740 --> 00:30:16.630 align:middle line:84%
almost like the Iwo Jima flag
moment from World War II.

00:30:16.630 --> 00:30:21.300 align:middle line:84%
Now what I had stumbled
across just doing this is I

00:30:21.300 --> 00:30:26.110 align:middle line:84%
looked at the chart for
9/11/2001, and in some ways

00:30:26.110 --> 00:30:29.060 align:middle line:84%
I believe that that's the
new chart for America,

00:30:29.060 --> 00:30:32.330 align:middle line:84%
not the July 4 chart
but the 9/11/2001 chart.

00:30:32.330 --> 00:30:34.670 align:middle line:84%
There's some interesting
aspects to it.

00:30:34.670 --> 00:30:36.700 align:middle line:84%
Maybe I'll get into it
on a different show.

00:30:36.700 --> 00:30:41.120 align:middle line:84%
But this is, in some ways,
the recasting of America.

00:30:41.120 --> 00:30:44.112 align:middle line:84%
And of course, this was
one of the orchestrators

00:30:44.112 --> 00:30:44.820 align:middle line:90%
during that time.

00:30:44.820 --> 00:30:47.230 align:middle line:84%
Again, look at the
flag in the background.

00:30:47.230 --> 00:30:49.940 align:middle line:84%
We just saw the flag
with the firemen,

00:30:49.940 --> 00:30:53.470 align:middle line:84%
and we saw Betsy Ross
creating the flag.

00:30:53.470 --> 00:30:55.820 align:middle line:84%
So this is a theme,
a concurrent theme

00:30:55.820 --> 00:30:57.530 align:middle line:90%
with Pluto in Sagittarius.

00:30:57.530 --> 00:31:00.505 align:middle line:84%
We got a simulacra of patriotism
with Pluto in Sagittarius.

00:31:00.505 --> 00:31:02.030 align:middle line:90%
Do you remember that?

00:31:02.030 --> 00:31:03.580 align:middle line:84%
You're either with
us or against us.

00:31:03.580 --> 00:31:06.330 align:middle line:84%
And if you eat a French
fry, you're a traitor.

00:31:06.330 --> 00:31:09.160 align:middle line:84%
And there was this real
kind of faux patriotism

00:31:09.160 --> 00:31:12.130 align:middle line:84%
that everybody kind of had
to swallow during that time.

00:31:12.130 --> 00:31:16.220 align:middle line:84%
And it was, I guess, great
if you were a politician

00:31:16.220 --> 00:31:19.930 align:middle line:84%
because you could ride
that bandwagon for, well,

00:31:19.930 --> 00:31:21.760 align:middle line:84%
as long as you
could, or at least

00:31:21.760 --> 00:31:26.430 align:middle line:84%
as long as the end of his term
as President of the United

00:31:26.430 --> 00:31:30.480 align:middle line:84%
States, and then it started
to get a little ugly.

00:31:30.480 --> 00:31:32.660 align:middle line:90%
This man, Osama bin Laden.

00:31:32.660 --> 00:31:35.130 align:middle line:84%
By the way, today happens to
be Osama bin Laden's birthday.

00:31:35.130 --> 00:31:37.960 align:middle line:84%
That's right, March
10, his birthday.

00:31:37.960 --> 00:31:43.400 align:middle line:84%
He becomes an image for
religious fundamentalism, which

00:31:43.400 --> 00:31:46.780 align:middle line:84%
is also another theme
for Pluto in Sagittarius.

00:31:46.780 --> 00:31:49.270 align:middle line:84%
And we see this from a
number of different corners,

00:31:49.270 --> 00:31:52.320 align:middle line:84%
but mainly at this
time the attribution

00:31:52.320 --> 00:31:59.300 align:middle line:84%
that radical Islam was the cause
of the September 11 attacks.

00:31:59.300 --> 00:32:04.350 align:middle line:84%
So Muslims became
demonized during the days

00:32:04.350 --> 00:32:10.020 align:middle line:84%
after September 11, and we
saw this extreme version,

00:32:10.020 --> 00:32:10.860 align:middle line:90%
the Wahabi.

00:32:10.860 --> 00:32:13.320 align:middle line:84%
Everybody became familiar,
thanks to Fox News,

00:32:13.320 --> 00:32:18.220 align:middle line:84%
with the Wahabi version
of Islam, the Wahabists.

00:32:18.220 --> 00:32:20.750 align:middle line:90%
And here we go.

00:32:20.750 --> 00:32:21.899 align:middle line:90%
Oh, this is interesting.

00:32:21.899 --> 00:32:24.190 align:middle line:10%
We're going to get into
another kind of extreme version

00:32:24.190 --> 00:32:30.140 align:middle line:10%
of religion, but this is the
cover from "The Sporting News,"

00:32:30.140 --> 00:32:32.970 align:middle line:10%
and this is after the New
England Patriots won the Super

00:32:32.970 --> 00:32:38.310 align:middle line:10%
Bowl, which was in, I
believe, February of 2002.

00:32:38.310 --> 00:32:41.879 align:middle line:84%
This is the first Super
Bowl after 9/11, right?

00:32:41.879 --> 00:32:42.920 align:middle line:90%
And what do we have here?

00:32:42.920 --> 00:32:45.830 align:middle line:84%
It's the Patriots,
"Patriots Day."

00:32:45.830 --> 00:32:50.280 align:middle line:84%
And so the first,
kind of, event that

00:32:50.280 --> 00:32:54.670 align:middle line:84%
buoys our spirits in a big
way in the collective theater

00:32:54.670 --> 00:32:56.030 align:middle line:90%
is the Super Bowl.

00:32:56.030 --> 00:32:58.325 align:middle line:84%
It's the Patriots
beating the Rams.

00:32:58.325 --> 00:33:00.350 align:middle line:90%
And it's the Patriots, right?

00:33:00.350 --> 00:33:03.030 align:middle line:84%
It's that American
spirit again, and we're

00:33:03.030 --> 00:33:08.480 align:middle line:84%
seeing this being broadcast
right into our homes

00:33:08.480 --> 00:33:11.210 align:middle line:84%
and into our psyches with
the New England Patriots

00:33:11.210 --> 00:33:13.150 align:middle line:84%
and "Sporting News"
and all the networks.

00:33:13.150 --> 00:33:15.870 align:middle line:84%
So it's reaffirming
in a lot of ways

00:33:15.870 --> 00:33:19.070 align:middle line:84%
the message that was being
sent across all media channels

00:33:19.070 --> 00:33:21.320 align:middle line:84%
at that time, that
you were to support

00:33:21.320 --> 00:33:23.980 align:middle line:84%
this new version
of America, based

00:33:23.980 --> 00:33:28.860 align:middle line:84%
on the new chart of America,
which took place on 9/11/2001.

00:33:28.860 --> 00:33:34.330 align:middle line:84%
And as a result, the Patriot
Act had been introduced as well.

00:33:34.330 --> 00:33:38.315 align:middle line:84%
So do you see how it's all
kind of syncing together here?

00:33:38.315 --> 00:33:40.690 align:middle line:84%
Now, one of the other things
that took place during Pluto

00:33:40.690 --> 00:33:42.780 align:middle line:84%
in Sagittarius is
that we saw-- we

00:33:42.780 --> 00:33:46.690 align:middle line:84%
began to see-- it
was happening then,

00:33:46.690 --> 00:33:51.620 align:middle line:84%
but we began to see the seeds
of corruption in sports.

00:33:51.620 --> 00:33:55.600 align:middle line:84%
And here we have Mark
McGwuire and Sammy Sosa,

00:33:55.600 --> 00:34:00.940 align:middle line:84%
kind of a classic sort of
a Greco-Roman thing going

00:34:00.940 --> 00:34:04.130 align:middle line:84%
on here with the
laurels of the heroes.

00:34:04.130 --> 00:34:06.480 align:middle line:84%
And of course, we're
seeing duality.

00:34:06.480 --> 00:34:08.480 align:middle line:84%
We're seeing the
black and white image,

00:34:08.480 --> 00:34:10.530 align:middle line:90%
Sammy Sosa, Mark McGwuire.

00:34:10.530 --> 00:34:12.090 align:middle line:90%
It was all manufactured.

00:34:12.090 --> 00:34:14.239 align:middle line:84%
They weren't really
all that good friends,

00:34:14.239 --> 00:34:18.670 align:middle line:84%
but they were on this, kind of,
quest to hit 60-plus home runs.

00:34:18.670 --> 00:34:19.909 align:middle line:90%
And how were they doing that?

00:34:19.909 --> 00:34:22.819 align:middle line:84%
They were doing it because
they were using steroids.

00:34:22.819 --> 00:34:23.735 align:middle line:90%
It made them stronger.

00:34:23.735 --> 00:34:24.800 align:middle line:90%
It made them bigger.

00:34:24.800 --> 00:34:26.170 align:middle line:90%
The ball traveled father.

00:34:26.170 --> 00:34:27.130 align:middle line:90%
They saw it better.

00:34:27.130 --> 00:34:30.350 align:middle line:84%
People who said that steroids
didn't affect baseball, made

00:34:30.350 --> 00:34:32.600 align:middle line:84%
baseball players better,
well, they were wrong.

00:34:32.600 --> 00:34:34.230 align:middle line:90%
Of course they did.

00:34:34.230 --> 00:34:37.820 align:middle line:84%
And this is what happened
during Pluto in Sagittarius.

00:34:37.820 --> 00:34:39.810 align:middle line:90%
Sagittarius rules sports, right?

00:34:39.810 --> 00:34:41.830 align:middle line:90%
And Pluto is extremes.

00:34:41.830 --> 00:34:45.790 align:middle line:84%
So these guys were going
to extreme measures

00:34:45.790 --> 00:34:48.900 align:middle line:84%
to build their body up so
that they would be successful.

00:34:48.900 --> 00:34:51.310 align:middle line:84%
And it came out later on,
thanks to Jose Canseco

00:34:51.310 --> 00:34:54.400 align:middle line:84%
and some other people, that
baseball was indeed dirty.

00:34:54.400 --> 00:34:55.110 align:middle line:90%
Why was it dirty?

00:34:55.110 --> 00:34:57.057 align:middle line:84%
Because they'd had
a strike, and people

00:34:57.057 --> 00:34:58.390 align:middle line:90%
were walking away from the game.

00:34:58.390 --> 00:34:59.815 align:middle line:90%
They were losing interest.

00:34:59.815 --> 00:35:01.377 align:middle line:90%
And so the players were juiced.

00:35:01.377 --> 00:35:02.210 align:middle line:90%
The ball was juiced.

00:35:02.210 --> 00:35:03.970 align:middle line:84%
It was flying out
of the ballpark.

00:35:03.970 --> 00:35:07.760 align:middle line:84%
Great ratings, people went back
to the ballpark to see games,

00:35:07.760 --> 00:35:10.310 align:middle line:84%
but unfortunately it was
Pluto in Sagittarius,

00:35:10.310 --> 00:35:13.650 align:middle line:84%
and they were using extreme
measures to do that.

00:35:13.650 --> 00:35:17.080 align:middle line:84%
Both of these guys are a
disgrace now, by the way.

00:35:17.080 --> 00:35:18.130 align:middle line:90%
Here's another example.

00:35:18.130 --> 00:35:20.620 align:middle line:84%
This is towards the end
of Pluto in Sagittarius.

00:35:20.620 --> 00:35:24.020 align:middle line:84%
This is Tim Donaghy,
a ref from the NBA.

00:35:24.020 --> 00:35:27.790 align:middle line:84%
And he was busted
for betting on games.

00:35:27.790 --> 00:35:32.110 align:middle line:84%
Now Donaghy intimates that
he wasn't the only one

00:35:32.110 --> 00:35:35.410 align:middle line:84%
and that the league
itself was fixing games.

00:35:35.410 --> 00:35:38.250 align:middle line:84%
Now it's kind of hard
to believe somebody

00:35:38.250 --> 00:35:40.200 align:middle line:90%
who's a convicted felon.

00:35:40.200 --> 00:35:44.240 align:middle line:84%
But if you ask me, I'd rather
believe a convicted felon who

00:35:44.240 --> 00:35:47.200 align:middle line:84%
had some insight into the
sport and into gambling

00:35:47.200 --> 00:35:49.670 align:middle line:84%
than somebody who
is saying, well, it

00:35:49.670 --> 00:35:52.570 align:middle line:84%
could never have happened,
and it's not true.

00:35:52.570 --> 00:35:56.290 align:middle line:84%
It didn't exist, and Donaghy's
a liar, and so on, and so on.

00:35:56.290 --> 00:35:59.565 align:middle line:84%
But again, it's another
specter of this Pluto

00:35:59.565 --> 00:36:01.160 align:middle line:90%
in Sagittarius piece.

00:36:01.160 --> 00:36:03.590 align:middle line:84%
Pluto also represents
the underworld.

00:36:03.590 --> 00:36:05.990 align:middle line:84%
So Tim Donaghy was dealing
with the underworld

00:36:05.990 --> 00:36:08.220 align:middle line:90%
through sports and Sagittarius.

00:36:08.220 --> 00:36:10.880 align:middle line:84%
And this is another
kind of manifestation

00:36:10.880 --> 00:36:13.300 align:middle line:90%
of astrology in action.

00:36:13.300 --> 00:36:15.110 align:middle line:90%
Now this is Ted Haggard.

00:36:15.110 --> 00:36:19.190 align:middle line:84%
And Ted Haggard was a minister
not far from the Gaiam studios

00:36:19.190 --> 00:36:19.710 align:middle line:90%
here.

00:36:19.710 --> 00:36:21.700 align:middle line:84%
He was minister of one
of these super churches,

00:36:21.700 --> 00:36:24.020 align:middle line:84%
the megachurches,
which were very, very

00:36:24.020 --> 00:36:27.300 align:middle line:84%
popular during the late
'90s and the early 2000s.

00:36:27.300 --> 00:36:30.380 align:middle line:84%
And in fact, George
Bush got elected

00:36:30.380 --> 00:36:32.140 align:middle line:84%
on the backs of
the megachurches.

00:36:32.140 --> 00:36:35.190 align:middle line:84%
And what was really
interesting about Ted Haggard

00:36:35.190 --> 00:36:41.590 align:middle line:84%
was that he-- I saw this great
special one time on NBC--

00:36:41.590 --> 00:36:44.640 align:middle line:84%
and Haggard and about ten other
ministers around the country

00:36:44.640 --> 00:36:47.831 align:middle line:84%
used to have conference calls
on a weekly basis with George

00:36:47.831 --> 00:36:48.330 align:middle line:90%
Bush.

00:36:48.330 --> 00:36:49.800 align:middle line:90%
He even admitted that.

00:36:49.800 --> 00:36:51.940 align:middle line:84%
And what they would do is
they would talk to Bush,

00:36:51.940 --> 00:36:53.790 align:middle line:84%
and they would talk
to his speech writers,

00:36:53.790 --> 00:36:55.770 align:middle line:84%
and they would
give him language.

00:36:55.770 --> 00:37:02.097 align:middle line:84%
And Bush would use
language, biblical language.

00:37:02.097 --> 00:37:03.680 align:middle line:84%
One of the phrases
that they would use

00:37:03.680 --> 00:37:08.060 align:middle line:84%
was the works of
wonder, works of wonder.

00:37:08.060 --> 00:37:11.770 align:middle line:84%
And Bush would use that
phrase in one of his speeches,

00:37:11.770 --> 00:37:13.580 align:middle line:84%
and of course these
guys, who we were

00:37:13.580 --> 00:37:16.650 align:middle line:84%
in charge of these
massive megachurches,

00:37:16.650 --> 00:37:20.140 align:middle line:84%
would also use that phrase
to their congregation,

00:37:20.140 --> 00:37:22.580 align:middle line:84%
so that there was this
kind of to and fro,

00:37:22.580 --> 00:37:25.680 align:middle line:84%
this call and response
between these megachurches

00:37:25.680 --> 00:37:27.460 align:middle line:90%
and Bush at that time.

00:37:27.460 --> 00:37:30.250 align:middle line:84%
And so what we saw was
this kind of collusion

00:37:30.250 --> 00:37:33.750 align:middle line:84%
but an extreme collusion,
an extreme version

00:37:33.750 --> 00:37:36.740 align:middle line:84%
of Christianity, which is
still popularized today

00:37:36.740 --> 00:37:40.310 align:middle line:84%
by the likes of John
Hagee and Pat Robertson.

00:37:40.310 --> 00:37:43.290 align:middle line:84%
And it's the end
times Christianity.

00:37:43.290 --> 00:37:45.680 align:middle line:84%
It's all based on the
Revelation and the Rapture,

00:37:45.680 --> 00:37:49.870 align:middle line:84%
and it's a death cult,
really, if you ask me.

00:37:49.870 --> 00:37:53.600 align:middle line:84%
And it got really popular
during this phase and cycle

00:37:53.600 --> 00:37:55.690 align:middle line:90%
when Bush was in office.

00:37:55.690 --> 00:38:00.440 align:middle line:84%
You had, in some ways, the clash
between Islam and Christianity

00:38:00.440 --> 00:38:03.650 align:middle line:84%
and sort of an echo
and a reincarnation

00:38:03.650 --> 00:38:05.630 align:middle line:84%
of the Crusades,
which is, again,

00:38:05.630 --> 00:38:08.190 align:middle line:84%
represents some form
of religious extremism.

00:38:08.190 --> 00:38:12.710 align:middle line:84%
And of course, Mr.
Haggard got in trouble.

00:38:12.710 --> 00:38:13.210 align:middle line:90%
Why?

00:38:13.210 --> 00:38:18.160 align:middle line:84%
Because he got
busted with a male,

00:38:18.160 --> 00:38:22.690 align:middle line:84%
a masseuse who also went
beyond the code of ethics

00:38:22.690 --> 00:38:24.850 align:middle line:90%
when it came to rubbing bodies.

00:38:24.850 --> 00:38:26.530 align:middle line:84%
And there was
methamphetamine involved.

00:38:26.530 --> 00:38:28.432 align:middle line:90%
So here again, we have Pluto.

00:38:28.432 --> 00:38:29.890 align:middle line:84%
It's kind of the
underworld, right?

00:38:29.890 --> 00:38:31.230 align:middle line:90%
It's drugs.

00:38:31.230 --> 00:38:32.510 align:middle line:90%
It's gay sex.

00:38:32.510 --> 00:38:37.870 align:middle line:84%
And here he's the head of this
massive megachurch in Colorado

00:38:37.870 --> 00:38:40.780 align:middle line:84%
helping set, in some ways,
not just poli-- in some ways

00:38:40.780 --> 00:38:43.360 align:middle line:84%
policy, but also
feeding the president

00:38:43.360 --> 00:38:46.770 align:middle line:84%
and giving him the verbiage and
the symbolism for his speeches.

00:38:46.770 --> 00:38:48.870 align:middle line:84%
It's a fall from grace,
but it's also indicative,

00:38:48.870 --> 00:38:51.440 align:middle line:84%
in some ways, of
Pluto in Sagittarius.

00:38:51.440 --> 00:38:53.390 align:middle line:90%
It's heresy, heresy.

00:38:53.390 --> 00:38:55.140 align:middle line:84%
So we go back to
heretics, which is

00:38:55.140 --> 00:38:57.970 align:middle line:90%
what I talked about early on.

00:38:57.970 --> 00:38:58.600 align:middle line:90%
Now here we go.

00:38:58.600 --> 00:39:00.240 align:middle line:84%
This is more
religious extremism.

00:39:00.240 --> 00:39:03.210 align:middle line:84%
These are the guys that were
supposedly involved in 9/11.

00:39:03.210 --> 00:39:05.110 align:middle line:84%
Most of them are still
around, by the way.

00:39:05.110 --> 00:39:06.675 align:middle line:84%
But this is kind
of the-- this is

00:39:06.675 --> 00:39:08.300 align:middle line:84%
what we were dealing
with at that time.

00:39:08.300 --> 00:39:12.160 align:middle line:84%
We were given the face of Islam,
and this was the new extremism,

00:39:12.160 --> 00:39:14.485 align:middle line:84%
religious extremism,
Pluto in Sagittarius.

00:39:14.485 --> 00:39:17.835 align:middle line:84%
I just wanted to jog
your memory a little bit.

00:39:17.835 --> 00:39:18.450 align:middle line:90%
All right.

00:39:18.450 --> 00:39:20.990 align:middle line:84%
Let's move on to the juicy
stuff, the here and the now.

00:39:20.990 --> 00:39:23.680 align:middle line:10%
This is "The Hunger
Games." "The Hunger Games,"

00:39:23.680 --> 00:39:28.460 align:middle line:10%
again, a really important Pluto
in Sagittarius movie and meme.

00:39:28.460 --> 00:39:30.570 align:middle line:10%
It was written by
Suzanne Collins.

00:39:30.570 --> 00:39:35.150 align:middle line:84%
Suzanne Collins is a resident,
by the way, of Sandy Hook.

00:39:35.150 --> 00:39:37.150 align:middle line:84%
You won't read
that on Wikipedia,

00:39:37.150 --> 00:39:38.880 align:middle line:90%
but she lives in Sandy Hook.

00:39:38.880 --> 00:39:40.460 align:middle line:84%
So here we have
"The Hunger Games."

00:39:40.460 --> 00:39:42.180 align:middle line:10%
We have the arrow,
the flaming arrow,

00:39:42.180 --> 00:39:45.900 align:middle line:10%
which is a resonant with
Pluto in Sagittarius,

00:39:45.900 --> 00:39:47.530 align:middle line:10%
and the mockingjay.

00:39:47.530 --> 00:39:51.990 align:middle line:10%
And of course, our hero,
Katniss Everdeen, a young women,

00:39:51.990 --> 00:39:54.140 align:middle line:10%
instead of the two young men.

00:39:54.140 --> 00:39:57.540 align:middle line:10%
So we have a theme here
that's being flipped,

00:39:57.540 --> 00:40:00.910 align:middle line:10%
and we'll also see this
in the movie "Divergent."

00:40:00.910 --> 00:40:04.120 align:middle line:84%
Here is Suzanne Collins, the
author of "The Hunger Games."

00:40:04.120 --> 00:40:06.870 align:middle line:84%
She's a Leo, so she deals
with fire, creativity.

00:40:06.870 --> 00:40:08.590 align:middle line:84%
She used to work
for Nickelodeon.

00:40:08.590 --> 00:40:12.460 align:middle line:84%
And if you watched the cartoon
"Little Bear" with your kids,

00:40:12.460 --> 00:40:17.820 align:middle line:84%
like I did with my kid, she
was the writer for that show.

00:40:17.820 --> 00:40:20.920 align:middle line:84%
Now here's where it gets
kind of intriguing for me.

00:40:20.920 --> 00:40:24.730 align:middle line:10%
This is one of the scenes
from "The Hunger Games."

00:40:24.730 --> 00:40:29.830 align:middle line:10%
This is at the beginning
when they're starting to do--

00:40:29.830 --> 00:40:32.280 align:middle line:10%
what do they call it?-- it's
like the lottery for when

00:40:32.280 --> 00:40:34.935 align:middle line:10%
they'll draw the boy and
the girl from the districts.

00:40:34.935 --> 00:40:39.410 align:middle line:84%
This is District 12, and these
are the boys from District 12.

00:40:39.410 --> 00:40:44.460 align:middle line:10%
And it gives you kind of a
sense here of the regimentation

00:40:44.460 --> 00:40:47.990 align:middle line:10%
of the youth kind of falling
into line in some ways,

00:40:47.990 --> 00:40:49.310 align:middle line:10%
with grays and whites.

00:40:49.310 --> 00:40:50.300 align:middle line:10%
It's very drab.

00:40:50.300 --> 00:40:52.050 align:middle line:10%
There's not a lot of color.

00:40:52.050 --> 00:40:53.530 align:middle line:10%
There's not a lot
of spirit here.

00:40:53.530 --> 00:40:54.930 align:middle line:10%
They seem kind of beaten down.

00:40:54.930 --> 00:40:59.810 align:middle line:10%
It's almost like a cross between
Philip K Dick and Steinbeck

00:40:59.810 --> 00:41:01.900 align:middle line:10%
with the imagery.

00:41:01.900 --> 00:41:05.420 align:middle line:10%
And what it's doing
in a lot of ways,

00:41:05.420 --> 00:41:07.900 align:middle line:10%
it's massaging the
psyche of the Pluto

00:41:07.900 --> 00:41:10.940 align:middle line:10%
in Sagittarius kids
who will watch this.

00:41:10.940 --> 00:41:13.960 align:middle line:84%
This is kind of what "The
Hunger Games" is all about.

00:41:13.960 --> 00:41:18.200 align:middle line:84%
It's getting children
used to a dystopian future

00:41:18.200 --> 00:41:22.490 align:middle line:84%
where they will fall
in line and they

00:41:22.490 --> 00:41:24.105 align:middle line:84%
will kill each other,
if they have to.

00:41:24.105 --> 00:41:27.020 align:middle line:84%
It's kind of a terrible
thought and premise,

00:41:27.020 --> 00:41:30.860 align:middle line:84%
but this is what the
Games are talking about.

00:41:30.860 --> 00:41:35.876 align:middle line:84%
By the way, it's based on
a Japanese TV series called

00:41:35.876 --> 00:41:37.250 align:middle line:84%
"Battle Royale,"
which is where I

00:41:37.250 --> 00:41:40.460 align:middle line:84%
think Suzanne
Collins got the idea.

00:41:40.460 --> 00:41:44.150 align:middle line:10%
So here we have the
regimentation of the youth,

00:41:44.150 --> 00:41:46.500 align:middle line:10%
of the boys in
"The Hunger Games."

00:41:46.500 --> 00:41:49.550 align:middle line:10%
By the way, "The Hunger Games"
consists of 12 districts.

00:41:49.550 --> 00:41:52.960 align:middle line:84%
District 13, which was
involved in nuclear energy,

00:41:52.960 --> 00:41:54.890 align:middle line:90%
got wiped out.

00:41:54.890 --> 00:41:56.090 align:middle line:90%
There's 12 districts.

00:41:56.090 --> 00:41:57.620 align:middle line:90%
There's 12 signs of the zodiac.

00:41:57.620 --> 00:41:59.650 align:middle line:90%
I'm just saying.

00:41:59.650 --> 00:42:01.920 align:middle line:90%
Now this is not out of a movie.

00:42:01.920 --> 00:42:06.530 align:middle line:84%
This is out of our current
time, our current milieu.

00:42:06.530 --> 00:42:08.660 align:middle line:84%
This is the first
group of kids that

00:42:08.660 --> 00:42:11.460 align:middle line:84%
had been graduated by the
Department of Homeland

00:42:11.460 --> 00:42:12.670 align:middle line:90%
Security.

00:42:12.670 --> 00:42:15.770 align:middle line:84%
And here they have
these toy guns.

00:42:15.770 --> 00:42:17.500 align:middle line:84%
The orange on the
barrel represents

00:42:17.500 --> 00:42:19.650 align:middle line:90%
that it's not a real weapon.

00:42:19.650 --> 00:42:22.950 align:middle line:84%
But I'm sure they have
fired real weapons

00:42:22.950 --> 00:42:25.050 align:middle line:90%
at some point in time.

00:42:25.050 --> 00:42:28.200 align:middle line:84%
And this is a group
of kids that are

00:42:28.200 --> 00:42:31.320 align:middle line:84%
being groomed right
now as we speak.

00:42:31.320 --> 00:42:33.680 align:middle line:84%
They are Pluto is
Sagittarius kids.

00:42:33.680 --> 00:42:35.260 align:middle line:84%
So this is what I
was talking about,

00:42:35.260 --> 00:42:37.280 align:middle line:90%
this whole regimentation piece.

00:42:37.280 --> 00:42:42.630 align:middle line:84%
Now I'm doing my best
not to profile here, OK?

00:42:42.630 --> 00:42:46.080 align:middle line:84%
But obviously these kids
are-- they're Latino.

00:42:46.080 --> 00:42:49.850 align:middle line:84%
And so this brings in another
aspect of Sagittarius,

00:42:49.850 --> 00:42:53.370 align:middle line:84%
which is dealing with foreign
cultures and other countries.

00:42:53.370 --> 00:42:57.980 align:middle line:84%
So my sense is is that these
are either first or second

00:42:57.980 --> 00:43:02.440 align:middle line:84%
generation Latin American
kids who are probably

00:43:02.440 --> 00:43:07.070 align:middle line:84%
going through
this-- maybe they're

00:43:07.070 --> 00:43:12.440 align:middle line:84%
getting some form of
rights as citizens.

00:43:12.440 --> 00:43:15.170 align:middle line:84%
I wouldn't be necessarily
sure about that.

00:43:15.170 --> 00:43:18.520 align:middle line:84%
But there is kind
of a sense here

00:43:18.520 --> 00:43:19.960 align:middle line:84%
that they are
arriving, that there

00:43:19.960 --> 00:43:21.640 align:middle line:90%
are a part of the country.

00:43:21.640 --> 00:43:23.590 align:middle line:84%
And not only they are
a part of the country,

00:43:23.590 --> 00:43:27.114 align:middle line:84%
but they're a part of
the country's future.

00:43:27.114 --> 00:43:28.530 align:middle line:84%
Now this is an
interesting symbol.

00:43:28.530 --> 00:43:32.010 align:middle line:84%
This took place at
the Olympics in China.

00:43:32.010 --> 00:43:35.280 align:middle line:84%
And then as you'll see, or
as you saw with "The Hunger

00:43:35.280 --> 00:43:39.730 align:middle line:84%
Games," with the flaming arrow
and the flaming mockingjay,

00:43:39.730 --> 00:43:42.720 align:middle line:84%
which is "Catching Fire," the
second of The Hunger Games

00:43:42.720 --> 00:43:46.820 align:middle line:84%
books and movies, we see
this fire symbol and the fire

00:43:46.820 --> 00:43:50.940 align:middle line:84%
symbolism really light up
and take place in China.

00:43:50.940 --> 00:43:52.690 align:middle line:84%
And what is Pluto
in Sagittarius?

00:43:52.690 --> 00:43:54.110 align:middle line:90%
They are a fire sign.

00:43:54.110 --> 00:43:57.960 align:middle line:84%
So fire is going to
become fairly prominent

00:43:57.960 --> 00:44:00.160 align:middle line:84%
in their generational
experience.

00:44:00.160 --> 00:44:02.610 align:middle line:10%
Now here we have "Divergent,"
which is the movie

00:44:02.610 --> 00:44:05.100 align:middle line:10%
that we started off with.

00:44:05.100 --> 00:44:08.430 align:middle line:10%
It's a series of three
novels, a trilogy, written

00:44:08.430 --> 00:44:13.420 align:middle line:10%
by Veronica Roth, who is also
a Leo, like Suzanne Collins.

00:44:13.420 --> 00:44:16.710 align:middle line:10%
So I guess the moral of the
story is if you're a Leo

00:44:16.710 --> 00:44:19.550 align:middle line:10%
and you want to write
dystopian children's books,

00:44:19.550 --> 00:44:21.210 align:middle line:10%
you've got a pretty
good shot at it.

00:44:21.210 --> 00:44:23.740 align:middle line:84%
Here we have the
fire symbolism again,

00:44:23.740 --> 00:44:25.460 align:middle line:84%
but we also have
the all-seeing eye

00:44:25.460 --> 00:44:28.897 align:middle line:84%
within the fire, which
is kind of interesting.

00:44:28.897 --> 00:44:31.230 align:middle line:84%
And for those of you who are
into noticing these things,

00:44:31.230 --> 00:44:33.544 align:middle line:84%
I'm sure you can see
that fairly easily.

00:44:33.544 --> 00:44:34.960 align:middle line:84%
This is not a
mistake, by the way.

00:44:34.960 --> 00:44:38.100 align:middle line:90%
None of this is by accident.

00:44:38.100 --> 00:44:43.150 align:middle line:84%
There's Veronica Roth,
the author of "Divergent"

00:44:43.150 --> 00:44:44.750 align:middle line:90%
and a Leo.

00:44:44.750 --> 00:44:45.670 align:middle line:90%
She's interesting.

00:44:45.670 --> 00:44:48.900 align:middle line:90%
She's Pluto in Scorpio.

00:44:48.900 --> 00:44:52.220 align:middle line:84%
She's Jewish by birth, but
she was raised as a Christian,

00:44:52.220 --> 00:44:54.410 align:middle line:84%
and she sees herself
as a Christian now.

00:44:54.410 --> 00:44:57.330 align:middle line:84%
So there's maybe some of
the religious themes coming

00:44:57.330 --> 00:45:02.570 align:middle line:84%
through her Pluto in Sagittarius
work, which is obviously

00:45:02.570 --> 00:45:04.470 align:middle line:84%
crafted for a
particular generation.

00:45:04.470 --> 00:45:07.290 align:middle line:84%
Here's a poster from
"Divergent," 3/21/14.

00:45:07.290 --> 00:45:08.440 align:middle line:10%
That's when it opens.

00:45:08.440 --> 00:45:10.570 align:middle line:10%
So it's not on that
cross, thank god.

00:45:10.570 --> 00:45:11.890 align:middle line:10%
That would almost be too much.

00:45:11.890 --> 00:45:14.800 align:middle line:10%
3/21/14, first day
of Sagittarius.

00:45:14.800 --> 00:45:18.790 align:middle line:10%
Oh, by the way, "The Hunger
Games: Catching Fire"

00:45:18.790 --> 00:45:25.040 align:middle line:10%
opened on 11/22/2013,
11/22/2013,

00:45:25.040 --> 00:45:27.660 align:middle line:10%
first day of Sagittarius, 11/22.

00:45:27.660 --> 00:45:28.440 align:middle line:90%
Got that?

00:45:28.440 --> 00:45:30.779 align:middle line:90%
First day of Sagittarius.

00:45:30.779 --> 00:45:32.320 align:middle line:84%
I just wanted to
throw that in there.

00:45:32.320 --> 00:45:33.530 align:middle line:90%
So look at the back here.

00:45:33.530 --> 00:45:37.130 align:middle line:10%
Here we have these symbols
going up and down the spine.

00:45:37.130 --> 00:45:38.625 align:middle line:10%
These are tattoos.

00:45:38.625 --> 00:45:41.660 align:middle line:90%


00:45:41.660 --> 00:45:44.430 align:middle line:10%
My sense here is that they
represent the chakras,

00:45:44.430 --> 00:45:46.422 align:middle line:10%
as the chakras go up
and down the spine.

00:45:46.422 --> 00:45:48.130 align:middle line:10%
And we're going to
get into these symbols

00:45:48.130 --> 00:45:49.260 align:middle line:10%
and what they mean.

00:45:49.260 --> 00:45:54.390 align:middle line:10%
But the image here is
that the chakra system

00:45:54.390 --> 00:45:58.790 align:middle line:10%
has become, in
some ways, exposed.

00:45:58.790 --> 00:46:03.090 align:middle line:10%
It's been put on the
skin of-- I think

00:46:03.090 --> 00:46:07.440 align:middle line:10%
his name is Four
in the movie, Four.

00:46:07.440 --> 00:46:10.830 align:middle line:10%
So here we have the chakra
system becoming exposed,

00:46:10.830 --> 00:46:15.340 align:middle line:10%
and the mystery of it is
revealed, and, in some ways,

00:46:15.340 --> 00:46:17.140 align:middle line:10%
it's locked into the skin.

00:46:17.140 --> 00:46:19.330 align:middle line:10%
So it's a bodily experience.

00:46:19.330 --> 00:46:22.640 align:middle line:84%
It's not necessarily a
spiritual experience.

00:46:22.640 --> 00:46:26.100 align:middle line:84%
These are the symbols
of "Divergent."

00:46:26.100 --> 00:46:31.030 align:middle line:84%
We have Abnegation, the
selfless, Dauntless, the brave.

00:46:31.030 --> 00:46:33.240 align:middle line:90%
We have Amity, the peaceful.

00:46:33.240 --> 00:46:35.220 align:middle line:84%
We have Erudite,
the intelligent,

00:46:35.220 --> 00:46:37.620 align:middle line:84%
and then there is
Candor, the honest.

00:46:37.620 --> 00:46:40.950 align:middle line:84%
If you look at these
symbols from an astrological

00:46:40.950 --> 00:46:44.430 align:middle line:84%
perspective, we have fire,
which is Dauntless, brave,

00:46:44.430 --> 00:46:45.920 align:middle line:90%
Sagittarius.

00:46:45.920 --> 00:46:50.890 align:middle line:84%
We have Abnegation, the
selfless, which is Pisces.

00:46:50.890 --> 00:46:53.440 align:middle line:90%
We have Amity, the peaceful.

00:46:53.440 --> 00:46:57.240 align:middle line:84%
Now sometimes we would
associate that with maybe Libra.

00:46:57.240 --> 00:46:59.110 align:middle line:90%
However, this is a tree.

00:46:59.110 --> 00:47:01.940 align:middle line:84%
It's related to the Earth
and the roots of the Earth.

00:47:01.940 --> 00:47:03.680 align:middle line:84%
And what sign do we
attribute to being

00:47:03.680 --> 00:47:06.030 align:middle line:84%
an Earth sign or
related to the Earth?

00:47:06.030 --> 00:47:06.970 align:middle line:90%
Virgo.

00:47:06.970 --> 00:47:09.150 align:middle line:84%
And then we have
Erudite, the intelligent

00:47:09.150 --> 00:47:11.530 align:middle line:90%
and, again, the all-seeing eye.

00:47:11.530 --> 00:47:15.100 align:middle line:84%
And what sign do we
associate with intelligence?

00:47:15.100 --> 00:47:15.600 align:middle line:90%
Gemini.

00:47:15.600 --> 00:47:21.410 align:middle line:84%
So here we have the four mutable
signs, Sagittarius, Pisces,

00:47:21.410 --> 00:47:23.950 align:middle line:84%
Virgo, Gemini, and
then the fifth sign

00:47:23.950 --> 00:47:26.470 align:middle line:84%
to tie it all together
is candor, the honest.

00:47:26.470 --> 00:47:31.060 align:middle line:84%
And it's explicit; it's
Libra, but you also

00:47:31.060 --> 00:47:32.910 align:middle line:84%
see the reconciliation
of opposites

00:47:32.910 --> 00:47:36.550 align:middle line:84%
here, white and black, black
and white, and in some ways that

00:47:36.550 --> 00:47:37.900 align:middle line:90%
also represents Gemini.

00:47:37.900 --> 00:47:41.730 align:middle line:84%
So it's the bridge between
Gemini and Libra, candor.

00:47:41.730 --> 00:47:43.120 align:middle line:84%
Really, really
interesting stuff.

00:47:43.120 --> 00:47:46.350 align:middle line:84%
And of course, the pentagon
right in the center of it

00:47:46.350 --> 00:47:48.360 align:middle line:84%
all, which, who
knows, may or may not

00:47:48.360 --> 00:47:53.200 align:middle line:84%
be engaged in the training of
the divergent personalities.

00:47:53.200 --> 00:47:54.525 align:middle line:90%
Actually, she's divergent.

00:47:54.525 --> 00:47:56.900 align:middle line:84%
Everybody else is part of one
of these sort of genotypes.

00:47:56.900 --> 00:47:59.800 align:middle line:90%


00:47:59.800 --> 00:48:02.060 align:middle line:84%
So, you're born into a
faction, and then you

00:48:02.060 --> 00:48:06.220 align:middle line:84%
choose to stay or
join a new faction.

00:48:06.220 --> 00:48:09.370 align:middle line:84%
So let's say you're
born into Abnegation.

00:48:09.370 --> 00:48:12.720 align:middle line:84%
I'm sensing here that
Abnegation or being born into it

00:48:12.720 --> 00:48:15.980 align:middle line:84%
would be some sort of
phenotype or genetic type.

00:48:15.980 --> 00:48:17.570 align:middle line:84%
And then along
the way, you could

00:48:17.570 --> 00:48:19.620 align:middle line:90%
choose to join something else.

00:48:19.620 --> 00:48:22.945 align:middle line:84%
But typology is really
important within the universe

00:48:22.945 --> 00:48:24.726 align:middle line:90%
of "Divergent."

00:48:24.726 --> 00:48:27.212 align:middle line:84%
Well, that brings us close
to the end of the show.

00:48:27.212 --> 00:48:28.920 align:middle line:84%
We're seeing here--
what I've been trying

00:48:28.920 --> 00:48:33.550 align:middle line:84%
to show you is that there is
a kind of a collective psyche

00:48:33.550 --> 00:48:36.850 align:middle line:84%
or collective drive around
Pluto in Sagittarius

00:48:36.850 --> 00:48:39.180 align:middle line:84%
towards some form
of regimentation

00:48:39.180 --> 00:48:42.220 align:middle line:84%
and potentially even
some form of revolution.

00:48:42.220 --> 00:48:46.410 align:middle line:84%
Because in both films,
"Divergent" and "The Hunger

00:48:46.410 --> 00:48:49.940 align:middle line:84%
Games," there's a
revolution that takes place,

00:48:49.940 --> 00:48:51.900 align:middle line:84%
and the revolution
is the burning down

00:48:51.900 --> 00:48:55.050 align:middle line:84%
of the existing regime
or the previous regime.

00:48:55.050 --> 00:48:57.450 align:middle line:84%
So perhaps another
part of this message

00:48:57.450 --> 00:49:01.080 align:middle line:84%
is is that they're wiring
our youth to at some point

00:49:01.080 --> 00:49:03.690 align:middle line:84%
have a revolution inside
of this country, for better

00:49:03.690 --> 00:49:04.890 align:middle line:90%
or for worse.

00:49:04.890 --> 00:49:08.680 align:middle line:84%
Perhaps it will bring a new
regime of more oppression,

00:49:08.680 --> 00:49:11.050 align:middle line:84%
or perhaps it'll be a
new regime of liberation,

00:49:11.050 --> 00:49:14.650 align:middle line:84%
but that certainly seems to
be the subtext of both films.

00:49:14.650 --> 00:49:16.980 align:middle line:84%
Now this last slide
I'm showing you

00:49:16.980 --> 00:49:19.080 align:middle line:84%
and then the clip
I'm about to show you

00:49:19.080 --> 00:49:23.680 align:middle line:84%
is from a current TV show
called "Friday Night Tykes."

00:49:23.680 --> 00:49:26.150 align:middle line:84%
It takes place here
in the United States

00:49:26.150 --> 00:49:30.130 align:middle line:84%
in the state of Texas, primarily
in the San Antonio area.

00:49:30.130 --> 00:49:32.970 align:middle line:84%
And it's a pretty
controversial show

00:49:32.970 --> 00:49:37.430 align:middle line:84%
because it shows football
coaches and their eight

00:49:37.430 --> 00:49:42.737 align:middle line:84%
and nine-year-old proteges
in practice and in games,

00:49:42.737 --> 00:49:44.320 align:middle line:84%
and it shows some
of the personal life

00:49:44.320 --> 00:49:46.830 align:middle line:84%
of the coaches and
the players as well.

00:49:46.830 --> 00:49:49.280 align:middle line:84%
And it's fairly intense,
and at some points,

00:49:49.280 --> 00:49:51.360 align:middle line:90%
it's kind of vicious.

00:49:51.360 --> 00:49:53.700 align:middle line:84%
It's like they're training
pitbulls, in some ways.

00:49:53.700 --> 00:49:57.060 align:middle line:84%
And as an athlete and
former football player,

00:49:57.060 --> 00:49:58.730 align:middle line:90%
I understand the mentality.

00:49:58.730 --> 00:50:01.190 align:middle line:84%
And as somebody
who lives in Texas,

00:50:01.190 --> 00:50:03.250 align:middle line:84%
I understand the
football mentality.

00:50:03.250 --> 00:50:06.900 align:middle line:84%
And as you'll see here, a
number of these kids come

00:50:06.900 --> 00:50:10.200 align:middle line:84%
from homes that have only
one parent, generally

00:50:10.200 --> 00:50:14.660 align:middle line:84%
the mother, so the football
coaches in this area,

00:50:14.660 --> 00:50:17.250 align:middle line:84%
in this part of San
Antonio, are playing

00:50:17.250 --> 00:50:22.060 align:middle line:84%
the role of the uber father or
the father that's not there,

00:50:22.060 --> 00:50:24.920 align:middle line:84%
and, as a result, they
have to be pretty intense

00:50:24.920 --> 00:50:25.836 align:middle line:90%
when they do that.

00:50:25.836 --> 00:50:27.210 align:middle line:84%
So I'm just showing
you this clip

00:50:27.210 --> 00:50:29.720 align:middle line:84%
because this gives you
a sense of the Pluto
