00:00:23.872 --> 00:00:24.830 align:middle line:90%
>> GREGG BRADEN: Hello.

00:00:24.830 --> 00:00:26.300 align:middle line:90%
My name's Gregg Braden.

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:27.950 align:middle line:10%
I'd like to welcome
you to today's very

00:00:27.950 --> 00:00:30.560 align:middle line:10%
special presentation
of "The Divine Matrix--

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:34.040 align:middle line:10%
Bridging Time and Space,
Miracles and Belief."

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:36.500 align:middle line:84%
In our last episode,
we discovered

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:40.100 align:middle line:84%
that we are biologically wired
to hack the divine matrix

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:42.950 align:middle line:90%
in seemingly superhuman ways.

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:45.410 align:middle line:84%
Well, in this episode, we're
going to go one step further.

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:48.560 align:middle line:84%
We'll uncover the
prayer code, the formula

00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:51.590 align:middle line:84%
for an empowered form of
prayer that is actually

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:53.780 align:middle line:84%
mirrored in the most
sophisticated computer

00:00:53.780 --> 00:00:55.790 align:middle line:84%
systems known to exist
in the world today.

00:00:55.790 --> 00:00:58.460 align:middle line:90%


00:00:58.460 --> 00:01:00.800 align:middle line:84%
Modern prayer
researchers typically

00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:03.320 align:middle line:84%
identify the way we
use prayer as falling

00:01:03.320 --> 00:01:07.640 align:middle line:84%
into one or some combination
of four modalities, the four

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:09.750 align:middle line:90%
modes of prayer.

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:11.810 align:middle line:84%
So what I'd like to
do is briefly describe

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:13.400 align:middle line:84%
each mode of prayer,
just so we're

00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:16.610 align:middle line:84%
clear on precisely what I'm
talking about in this episode,

00:01:16.610 --> 00:01:19.850 align:middle line:84%
and then go into the details
of another mode of prayer,

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:23.340 align:middle line:84%
a fifth mode, a
lost mode of prayer.

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:26.600 align:middle line:84%
So the first modality of prayer
that researchers typically

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:32.160 align:middle line:84%
refer to is called an informal
or a colloquial form of prayer.

00:01:32.160 --> 00:01:34.178 align:middle line:84%
And I think we all use
these from time to time.

00:01:34.178 --> 00:01:35.720 align:middle line:84%
These are the kind
of prayers that we

00:01:35.720 --> 00:01:38.000 align:middle line:84%
say when we're in trouble,
when we're in a jam,

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:41.240 align:middle line:84%
we feel powerless, and we need
help, when we need it quickly.

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:45.620 align:middle line:84%
So for example, I had a friend
that lived in a big city.

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:47.420 align:middle line:84%
Every Friday
afternoon, my friend

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:51.020 align:middle line:84%
would drive down a long freeway
on the way home in a West Coast

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:52.130 align:middle line:90%
city.

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:55.340 align:middle line:84%
And the prayer of my
friend would be please,

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:57.740 align:middle line:84%
dear, God, don't
let my gas tank go

00:01:57.740 --> 00:01:59.820 align:middle line:84%
to empty before I get to
the end of this freeway.

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:01.910 align:middle line:84%
That happened
every Friday night.

00:02:01.910 --> 00:02:03.980 align:middle line:84%
So this is an example
of an informal

00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:07.220 align:middle line:90%
or a colloquial prayer.

00:02:07.220 --> 00:02:10.110 align:middle line:84%
The second mode of prayer
is a little bit different.

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:12.410 align:middle line:84%
It's called a
petitionary prayer.

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:14.630 align:middle line:84%
And this is the kind of
prayer where we literally

00:02:14.630 --> 00:02:18.380 align:middle line:84%
petition a higher
power, we petition God

00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:21.830 align:middle line:90%
for some particular outcome.

00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:24.860 align:middle line:84%
Years ago, I had the
opportunity to spend some time

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:28.310 align:middle line:84%
with the I AM teachings,
people that practice

00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:30.020 align:middle line:90%
the I AM teachings.

00:02:30.020 --> 00:02:33.950 align:middle line:84%
And they use this petitionary
mode of prayer frequently.

00:02:33.950 --> 00:02:35.450 align:middle line:84%
And they would say
something like, I

00:02:35.450 --> 00:02:37.970 align:middle line:84%
petition God for
the right to heal

00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:41.210 align:middle line:84%
and be healed now and
in all past, present,

00:02:41.210 --> 00:02:43.380 align:middle line:90%
and future manifestations.

00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:47.790 align:middle line:84%
So this would be considered
a petitionary mode of prayer.

00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:51.270 align:middle line:84%
The third mode of prayer
is as a controversial mode,

00:02:51.270 --> 00:02:53.520 align:middle line:84%
and some researchers
do not consider

00:02:53.520 --> 00:02:55.710 align:middle line:84%
what I'm about to
say a mode of prayer,

00:02:55.710 --> 00:02:58.700 align:middle line:84%
because it is a
meditative prayer.

00:02:58.700 --> 00:03:00.450 align:middle line:90%
We're not really doing anything.

00:03:00.450 --> 00:03:06.120 align:middle line:84%
We are simply in silence and
aware of our surroundings,

00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:08.580 align:middle line:90%
aware of our environment.

00:03:08.580 --> 00:03:10.830 align:middle line:84%
And because it is a
meditative prayer,

00:03:10.830 --> 00:03:12.840 align:middle line:84%
many researchers say
meditation is not prayer.

00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:13.890 align:middle line:90%
They separate these two.

00:03:13.890 --> 00:03:15.840 align:middle line:84%
But I'm sharing
it with you here,

00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:19.510 align:middle line:84%
because it is often considered
as well a mode of prayer.

00:03:19.510 --> 00:03:21.540 align:middle line:84%
So the fourth and
last mode of prayer

00:03:21.540 --> 00:03:24.750 align:middle line:84%
identified typically
by prayer researchers,

00:03:24.750 --> 00:03:27.260 align:middle line:84%
it's called a ritualistic
form of prayer.

00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:28.770 align:middle line:84%
And I think we all
have done these

00:03:28.770 --> 00:03:33.040 align:middle line:84%
and been taught to do this
at some point in our lives.

00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:36.630 align:middle line:84%
This is the kind of prayer where
we say just the right words,

00:03:36.630 --> 00:03:39.000 align:middle line:84%
very specific words at
just the right time of day

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:42.780 align:middle line:84%
or just the right time of night
or before the meal in just

00:03:42.780 --> 00:03:45.730 align:middle line:84%
the right time of year and
the right day of the year.

00:03:45.730 --> 00:03:48.940 align:middle line:84%
And we believe that
when we say the words,

00:03:48.940 --> 00:03:52.530 align:middle line:84%
something is actually
happening, that we are somehow

00:03:52.530 --> 00:03:58.110 align:middle line:84%
communicating to a higher
power or to a greater essence.

00:03:58.110 --> 00:03:59.180 align:middle line:90%
Something is happening.

00:03:59.180 --> 00:04:02.070 align:middle line:84%
And while these prayers
may be well-intentioned,

00:04:02.070 --> 00:04:04.710 align:middle line:84%
sometimes we find that
the outcome is lacking,

00:04:04.710 --> 00:04:08.170 align:middle line:84%
or maybe it doesn't
even happen at all.

00:04:08.170 --> 00:04:10.170 align:middle line:84%
So I want to just
elaborate on this mode

00:04:10.170 --> 00:04:12.600 align:middle line:84%
of prayer a little bit,
my experiences in Tibet.

00:04:12.600 --> 00:04:15.810 align:middle line:84%
Once again, I'm going
to go back into Tibet,

00:04:15.810 --> 00:04:18.000 align:middle line:84%
because it was so
accessible to me

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:20.820 align:middle line:84%
for this window of
time in the 1990s.

00:04:20.820 --> 00:04:22.380 align:middle line:84%
That window
unfortunately has closed.

00:04:22.380 --> 00:04:25.020 align:middle line:84%
And I'm not able to go
and take people and have

00:04:25.020 --> 00:04:29.740 align:middle line:84%
the same experiences as I was
during that period of time.

00:04:29.740 --> 00:04:33.330 align:middle line:10%
So I feel very fortunate
to have had the access

00:04:33.330 --> 00:04:34.980 align:middle line:10%
to the monasteries
and to the people,

00:04:34.980 --> 00:04:38.070 align:middle line:10%
to the monks and the
nuns in those monasteries

00:04:38.070 --> 00:04:40.290 align:middle line:10%
and the ability to
interact with them.

00:04:40.290 --> 00:04:42.730 align:middle line:10%
And for me, this is the power.

00:04:42.730 --> 00:04:45.660 align:middle line:84%
And this is the
opportunity that we

00:04:45.660 --> 00:04:49.770 align:middle line:84%
have to interact with
our indigenous history,

00:04:49.770 --> 00:04:52.560 align:middle line:84%
with the people of our past,
the indigenous wisdom that's

00:04:52.560 --> 00:04:55.800 align:middle line:84%
preserved so much
wisdom for so long.

00:04:55.800 --> 00:04:59.460 align:middle line:84%
And let me just share with
you a bit why this is.

00:04:59.460 --> 00:05:01.800 align:middle line:10%
When we go to an
ancient text, and we

00:05:01.800 --> 00:05:04.540 align:middle line:10%
can read the words
on a scroll, we

00:05:04.540 --> 00:05:07.570 align:middle line:10%
can read the hieroglyphs
on a temple wall in Egypt

00:05:07.570 --> 00:05:13.990 align:middle line:10%
or in a monument in the
Yucatan, in the Mayan lands.

00:05:13.990 --> 00:05:16.030 align:middle line:10%
And when we read
those hieroglyphs

00:05:16.030 --> 00:05:20.590 align:middle line:10%
or those ancient texts, we think
we know what they're saying.

00:05:20.590 --> 00:05:25.330 align:middle line:84%
However, there are nuances
that can only be understood

00:05:25.330 --> 00:05:26.890 align:middle line:90%
through human communication.

00:05:26.890 --> 00:05:29.840 align:middle line:84%
It's when two humans are in
the presence of one another,

00:05:29.840 --> 00:05:33.550 align:middle line:84%
eye to eye, mind to mind,
heart to heart, god to god.

00:05:33.550 --> 00:05:35.680 align:middle line:84%
It's when I can
look another human

00:05:35.680 --> 00:05:38.950 align:middle line:84%
in the eye, a Tibetan monk,
for example, or a nun.

00:05:38.950 --> 00:05:44.020 align:middle line:84%
And I can ask them, when you
had this experience just now,

00:05:44.020 --> 00:05:46.720 align:middle line:84%
what was happening
inside of your body.

00:05:46.720 --> 00:05:49.670 align:middle line:84%
When you had this experience,
what were you feeling?

00:05:49.670 --> 00:05:51.350 align:middle line:84%
How did you trigger
this experience?

00:05:51.350 --> 00:05:53.740 align:middle line:84%
What did you do to make
these things possible,

00:05:53.740 --> 00:05:56.755 align:middle line:84%
like the brain states we spoke
about in the earlier episodes?

00:05:56.755 --> 00:05:58.180 align:middle line:90%
You can't get that from a text.

00:05:58.180 --> 00:06:00.160 align:middle line:84%
You can't get that
from a temple wall.

00:06:00.160 --> 00:06:02.410 align:middle line:84%
So for me, people ask
me all the time, Gregg,

00:06:02.410 --> 00:06:06.030 align:middle line:84%
why would you spend so much
time in the dusty deserts

00:06:06.030 --> 00:06:08.200 align:middle line:90%
and in the high altitudes.

00:06:08.200 --> 00:06:09.700 align:middle line:84%
And this is the
reason, because it's

00:06:09.700 --> 00:06:12.220 align:middle line:84%
in these places where
the wisdom of our past

00:06:12.220 --> 00:06:15.830 align:middle line:84%
is preserved by
us, by our family.

00:06:15.830 --> 00:06:17.895 align:middle line:84%
And there's a
continuity of knowledge

00:06:17.895 --> 00:06:19.270 align:middle line:84%
that exists if we
have the wisdom

00:06:19.270 --> 00:06:20.353 align:middle line:90%
to embrace that knowledge.

00:06:20.353 --> 00:06:23.020 align:middle line:84%
So much of what I'm
sharing with you here

00:06:23.020 --> 00:06:25.450 align:middle line:84%
in this particular
episode, especially,

00:06:25.450 --> 00:06:27.850 align:middle line:84%
throughout the whole
program, but specifically

00:06:27.850 --> 00:06:30.700 align:middle line:84%
in this episode, is going
to be part of that lineage,

00:06:30.700 --> 00:06:33.520 align:middle line:84%
part of that
continuity of wisdom.

00:06:33.520 --> 00:06:35.830 align:middle line:84%
So just so it's very clear
what I'm saying here,

00:06:35.830 --> 00:06:38.210 align:middle line:84%
let me give you an example of
something that happened me,

00:06:38.210 --> 00:06:40.630 align:middle line:84%
a story of what
happened when I was

00:06:40.630 --> 00:06:45.220 align:middle line:84%
in the presence of one of the
monks during my time in Tibet.

00:06:45.220 --> 00:06:49.090 align:middle line:84%
I had been in a chanting
hall in a monastery.

00:06:49.090 --> 00:06:50.590 align:middle line:84%
Again, these are
very high altitude,

00:06:50.590 --> 00:06:54.470 align:middle line:84%
this is about 16,500
feet above sea level.

00:06:54.470 --> 00:06:56.260 align:middle line:90%
The air is thin.

00:06:56.260 --> 00:06:57.290 align:middle line:90%
It is cool.

00:06:57.290 --> 00:06:58.900 align:middle line:90%
Is beautiful.

00:06:58.900 --> 00:07:04.540 align:middle line:84%
Inside of these monasteries, the
floors are cold, they're dry,

00:07:04.540 --> 00:07:07.270 align:middle line:84%
they're made of
stone, they're dark.

00:07:07.270 --> 00:07:10.420 align:middle line:84%
And it's very interesting,
they're always cold inside,

00:07:10.420 --> 00:07:12.787 align:middle line:84%
because the monks say if
you want to be warmer--

00:07:12.787 --> 00:07:13.870 align:middle line:90%
they don't heat the space.

00:07:13.870 --> 00:07:15.037 align:middle line:90%
They say, wear more clothes.

00:07:15.037 --> 00:07:17.500 align:middle line:84%
And that's why the
robes for these monks

00:07:17.500 --> 00:07:20.470 align:middle line:84%
are often so heavy
and so dense that when

00:07:20.470 --> 00:07:22.480 align:middle line:84%
they stand up and
walk away from where

00:07:22.480 --> 00:07:26.350 align:middle line:84%
they've been in their
lotus position meditating,

00:07:26.350 --> 00:07:31.420 align:middle line:84%
and they leave their prayer
shawls behind, when they leave

00:07:31.420 --> 00:07:34.270 align:middle line:84%
these ponchos
behind, if you will,

00:07:34.270 --> 00:07:36.980 align:middle line:84%
they're so dense that they will
actually stand up on their own,

00:07:36.980 --> 00:07:40.645 align:middle line:84%
even though there's no monk
inside for them to wrap around.

00:07:40.645 --> 00:07:42.520 align:middle line:84%
But it was when I was
in one of these places.

00:07:42.520 --> 00:07:44.590 align:middle line:84%
I had just been with
these 300 monks.

00:07:44.590 --> 00:07:46.590 align:middle line:84%
And I was sitting among
them as they were doing

00:07:46.590 --> 00:07:48.850 align:middle line:90%
the chants and the prayers.

00:07:48.850 --> 00:07:51.970 align:middle line:84%
And at the close, I asked one
of the monks this question.

00:07:51.970 --> 00:07:54.820 align:middle line:84%
I said, when we see your
prayers on the outside, what's

00:07:54.820 --> 00:07:56.590 align:middle line:90%
happening on the inside?

00:07:56.590 --> 00:08:00.070 align:middle line:84%
When we see the
bells and the bowls

00:08:00.070 --> 00:08:03.850 align:middle line:84%
and the mantras and the
incense and the chimes,

00:08:03.850 --> 00:08:07.210 align:middle line:84%
when we see the chanting
on the outside, I said,

00:08:07.210 --> 00:08:08.530 align:middle line:90%
what are you doing inside?

00:08:08.530 --> 00:08:11.140 align:middle line:84%
And he looked at
me, and he said,

00:08:11.140 --> 00:08:13.990 align:middle line:84%
you've never seen a prayer,
because a prayer cannot be

00:08:13.990 --> 00:08:15.190 align:middle line:90%
seen.

00:08:15.190 --> 00:08:20.740 align:middle line:84%
He said, what you see is us on
the outside doing the things

00:08:20.740 --> 00:08:22.510 align:middle line:90%
that create a feeling.

00:08:22.510 --> 00:08:24.680 align:middle line:90%
And the feeling is the prayer.

00:08:24.680 --> 00:08:25.540 align:middle line:90%
This is the key.

00:08:25.540 --> 00:08:27.730 align:middle line:90%
The feeling is the prayer.

00:08:27.730 --> 00:08:30.610 align:middle line:84%
And then he turned to
me, and he asked me,

00:08:30.610 --> 00:08:32.284 align:middle line:90%
he turned the question on me.

00:08:32.284 --> 00:08:33.909 align:middle line:84%
And he said, the
feeling is the prayer.

00:08:33.909 --> 00:08:36.250 align:middle line:84%
How do you do this
in your culture?

00:08:36.250 --> 00:08:40.990 align:middle line:84%
And I realized that you
and I, with few exceptions,

00:08:40.990 --> 00:08:44.049 align:middle line:84%
have been conditioned,
through this ritualistic form

00:08:44.049 --> 00:08:45.250 align:middle line:90%
of prayer.

00:08:45.250 --> 00:08:49.540 align:middle line:84%
What we do is we're
conditioned to say the words.

00:08:49.540 --> 00:08:53.410 align:middle line:84%
And when we say the words, we
think we've said the prayer.

00:08:53.410 --> 00:08:55.900 align:middle line:84%
When we say the words
before a meal, God is great,

00:08:55.900 --> 00:08:59.380 align:middle line:84%
God is good, or
before we go to sleep,

00:08:59.380 --> 00:09:02.050 align:middle line:84%
now I lay me down to sleep,
pray the Lord my soul

00:09:02.050 --> 00:09:04.270 align:middle line:84%
to keep-- that actually is
a very frightening prayer

00:09:04.270 --> 00:09:06.400 align:middle line:90%
for a young person to hear.

00:09:06.400 --> 00:09:10.420 align:middle line:84%
When we say those
words, we believe

00:09:10.420 --> 00:09:13.850 align:middle line:84%
that we have said
something to the field.

00:09:13.850 --> 00:09:15.940 align:middle line:84%
But the key to interacting
with the matrix

00:09:15.940 --> 00:09:20.220 align:middle line:84%
is to communicate in a language
that the matrix recognizes.

00:09:20.220 --> 00:09:23.860 align:middle line:84%
And the matrix does not always
recognize a verbal command,

00:09:23.860 --> 00:09:25.090 align:middle line:90%
it may.

00:09:25.090 --> 00:09:26.138 align:middle line:90%
But the verbal command--

00:09:26.138 --> 00:09:28.180 align:middle line:84%
now, I'm going to invite
you to think about this.

00:09:28.180 --> 00:09:32.680 align:middle line:84%
Our words were designed
as the code that creates

00:09:32.680 --> 00:09:34.990 align:middle line:90%
the feeling in our bodies.

00:09:34.990 --> 00:09:37.510 align:middle line:90%
And the feeling is the prayer.

00:09:37.510 --> 00:09:40.030 align:middle line:84%
So when you think about
prayer from that perspective

00:09:40.030 --> 00:09:42.520 align:middle line:84%
and you read an
ancient prayer manual,

00:09:42.520 --> 00:09:45.190 align:middle line:84%
it's not that the
words are magic.

00:09:45.190 --> 00:09:48.940 align:middle line:84%
It's the words were
designed to be a code

00:09:48.940 --> 00:09:52.210 align:middle line:84%
to trigger an experience
inside of your body

00:09:52.210 --> 00:09:56.530 align:middle line:84%
that interacts with the world
beyond your body or the field

00:09:56.530 --> 00:10:00.450 align:middle line:84%
or the matrix that is part of
your body, to be more specific.

00:10:00.450 --> 00:10:02.200 align:middle line:84%
When we begin to think
of prayer that way,

00:10:02.200 --> 00:10:04.090 align:middle line:84%
it takes on a whole
different meaning.

00:10:04.090 --> 00:10:06.040 align:middle line:84%
You're going to see
in just a few moments.

00:10:06.040 --> 00:10:07.900 align:middle line:84%
You've heard the term
that things are often

00:10:07.900 --> 00:10:09.710 align:middle line:90%
lost in translation?

00:10:09.710 --> 00:10:11.440 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to share
with you a translation

00:10:11.440 --> 00:10:14.830 align:middle line:84%
of an ancient prayer,
the original text,

00:10:14.830 --> 00:10:18.010 align:middle line:84%
and where things were
changed in the translation.

00:10:18.010 --> 00:10:20.468 align:middle line:90%
You'll see exactly what I mean.

00:10:20.468 --> 00:10:22.510 align:middle line:84%
So with that in mind, I'm
going to share with you

00:10:22.510 --> 00:10:25.990 align:middle line:84%
a form of prayer, a
feeling-based prayer that

00:10:25.990 --> 00:10:29.050 align:middle line:84%
illustrates precisely what
we're talking about now

00:10:29.050 --> 00:10:31.570 align:middle line:84%
as well as a mode of
prayer that is not

00:10:31.570 --> 00:10:34.690 align:middle line:84%
accounted for in those
first four modalities.

00:10:34.690 --> 00:10:38.080 align:middle line:84%
So excluding the
meditative form of prayer,

00:10:38.080 --> 00:10:40.780 align:middle line:84%
the common theme that runs
through each of the three

00:10:40.780 --> 00:10:44.680 align:middle line:84%
remaining modes that I've just
identified is that each of them

00:10:44.680 --> 00:10:49.080 align:middle line:84%
are called prayers
of supplication.

00:10:49.080 --> 00:10:51.730 align:middle line:84%
These are the kind of prayers
that we are conditioned

00:10:51.730 --> 00:10:56.980 align:middle line:84%
to use when we feel helpless, we
feel powerless in a situation.

00:10:56.980 --> 00:10:59.360 align:middle line:84%
And we feel the need
to ask for help.

00:10:59.360 --> 00:11:00.980 align:middle line:90%
We need intervention.

00:11:00.980 --> 00:11:03.220 align:middle line:84%
And I'm not surprised that
this is such a common form

00:11:03.220 --> 00:11:06.028 align:middle line:84%
of prayer, because
think about the story

00:11:06.028 --> 00:11:08.320 align:middle line:84%
that you and I are conditioned
to embrace in our lives.

00:11:08.320 --> 00:11:11.500 align:middle line:84%
We're taught that we live
in a world of separation,

00:11:11.500 --> 00:11:13.120 align:middle line:84%
that we are separate
from one another.

00:11:13.120 --> 00:11:14.370 align:middle line:90%
We're separate from the Earth.

00:11:14.370 --> 00:11:16.290 align:middle line:90%
We're separate from ourselves.

00:11:16.290 --> 00:11:19.090 align:middle line:84%
And that's why we need
to ask for intervention,

00:11:19.090 --> 00:11:20.890 align:middle line:84%
medical intervention
when something happens

00:11:20.890 --> 00:11:23.530 align:middle line:84%
with our bodies that we're not
comfortable with, spiritual

00:11:23.530 --> 00:11:26.270 align:middle line:84%
intervention when something
happens in our lives,

00:11:26.270 --> 00:11:27.730 align:middle line:90%
and we need help.

00:11:27.730 --> 00:11:30.580 align:middle line:84%
What I'm saying to you now is
all of those things are good,

00:11:30.580 --> 00:11:34.240 align:middle line:84%
and they work in very specific
instances in our lives.

00:11:34.240 --> 00:11:35.950 align:middle line:90%
We're building a toolbox.

00:11:35.950 --> 00:11:39.340 align:middle line:84%
We are building a
spiritual toolbox

00:11:39.340 --> 00:11:41.440 align:middle line:90%
and a scientific toolbox.

00:11:41.440 --> 00:11:45.280 align:middle line:84%
And we're marrying these two
very different ways of knowing,

00:11:45.280 --> 00:11:47.350 align:middle line:84%
the best science of
the modern world,

00:11:47.350 --> 00:11:50.980 align:middle line:84%
the wisdom of 5,000 years
of human spirituality,

00:11:50.980 --> 00:11:53.530 align:middle line:84%
weaving them into
an experience that

00:11:53.530 --> 00:11:57.550 align:middle line:84%
transcends the limitations that
either can have individually.

00:11:57.550 --> 00:12:00.760 align:middle line:84%
Science is good, but science can
only tell us how things work.

00:12:00.760 --> 00:12:02.672 align:middle line:84%
Spiritual traditions
can tell us how

00:12:02.672 --> 00:12:04.630 align:middle line:84%
to apply it the way things
work, but they cant'

00:12:04.630 --> 00:12:06.670 align:middle line:90%
always tell us why they work.

00:12:06.670 --> 00:12:09.070 align:middle line:84%
Our modern world today,
we've reached a point

00:12:09.070 --> 00:12:10.460 align:middle line:90%
where we need both.

00:12:10.460 --> 00:12:12.050 align:middle line:84%
So we are building
the vocabulary.

00:12:12.050 --> 00:12:14.050 align:middle line:84%
We're building the wisdom
and the understanding.

00:12:14.050 --> 00:12:16.150 align:middle line:84%
It's a very, very
different way of thinking.

00:12:16.150 --> 00:12:20.830 align:middle line:84%
So what I'd like to
do is take all of this

00:12:20.830 --> 00:12:23.770 align:middle line:84%
and be very, very clear that
while we have all probably

00:12:23.770 --> 00:12:25.390 align:middle line:84%
used, in one form
or another, one

00:12:25.390 --> 00:12:29.682 align:middle line:84%
of those three modes of prayer,
just recognize those are tools.

00:12:29.682 --> 00:12:30.640 align:middle line:90%
And they're good tools.

00:12:30.640 --> 00:12:32.057 align:middle line:84%
And they've served
us in the past.

00:12:32.057 --> 00:12:34.750 align:middle line:84%
But here's the question,
is there another tool.

00:12:34.750 --> 00:12:38.170 align:middle line:84%
Could there be another
mode of prayer?

00:12:38.170 --> 00:12:40.780 align:middle line:84%
In addition to the four
that we've just identified,

00:12:40.780 --> 00:12:42.070 align:middle line:90%
is there a fifth?

00:12:42.070 --> 00:12:45.070 align:middle line:84%
Is there a fifth mode
or a lost mode of prayer

00:12:45.070 --> 00:12:48.190 align:middle line:84%
that allows us to move
beyond needing intervention,

00:12:48.190 --> 00:12:51.700 align:middle line:84%
beyond asking for help, a
mode of prayer that allows

00:12:51.700 --> 00:12:55.070 align:middle line:90%
us to be part of the solution?

00:12:55.070 --> 00:12:56.830 align:middle line:84%
So in other words,
is there a way

00:12:56.830 --> 00:12:58.990 align:middle line:84%
of communicating with
the divine matrix,

00:12:58.990 --> 00:13:02.470 align:middle line:84%
with this Higgs field
that considers us

00:13:02.470 --> 00:13:05.860 align:middle line:84%
as part of, rather than
separate from, the field

00:13:05.860 --> 00:13:08.720 align:middle line:84%
that we are experiencing
from within?

00:13:08.720 --> 00:13:11.410 align:middle line:84%
Well, the answer is the reason
that I'm sharing this episode.

00:13:11.410 --> 00:13:12.980 align:middle line:90%
It's a resounding yes.

00:13:12.980 --> 00:13:15.080 align:middle line:84%
So what I'd like to do
is share an example.

00:13:15.080 --> 00:13:15.880 align:middle line:90%
This is a story.

00:13:15.880 --> 00:13:17.530 align:middle line:84%
It's a true story
that happened to me

00:13:17.530 --> 00:13:21.340 align:middle line:84%
when I left the corporations
in the early 1990s.

00:13:21.340 --> 00:13:25.000 align:middle line:84%
And I moved to a piece of
land in the high desert

00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:26.930 align:middle line:90%
of northern New Mexico.

00:13:26.930 --> 00:13:29.560 align:middle line:84%
And those of you that live
in that part of the world,

00:13:29.560 --> 00:13:32.830 align:middle line:84%
you may remember, the 1990s
was one of the worst droughts

00:13:32.830 --> 00:13:33.890 align:middle line:90%
in recorded history.

00:13:33.890 --> 00:13:36.280 align:middle line:84%
The elders of the
native peoples,

00:13:36.280 --> 00:13:39.100 align:middle line:84%
they said, in the memory
of their ancestors,

00:13:39.100 --> 00:13:41.560 align:middle line:84%
they'd never seen a drought
that had lasted as long as what

00:13:41.560 --> 00:13:42.435 align:middle line:90%
we were experiencing.

00:13:42.435 --> 00:13:44.450 align:middle line:90%
It was going on five-plus years.

00:13:44.450 --> 00:13:45.250 align:middle line:90%
It was terrible.

00:13:45.250 --> 00:13:46.330 align:middle line:90%
Cattle were dying.

00:13:46.330 --> 00:13:47.778 align:middle line:90%
Crops were dying.

00:13:47.778 --> 00:13:50.320 align:middle line:84%
People were selling their farms,
because they could no longer

00:13:50.320 --> 00:13:53.090 align:middle line:90%
support themselves on the land.

00:13:53.090 --> 00:13:55.600 align:middle line:84%
And it was during this time
that a native friend of mine

00:13:55.600 --> 00:13:57.400 align:middle line:90%
called me one morning.

00:13:57.400 --> 00:14:00.400 align:middle line:84%
And to honor his privacy,
I'm going to call him David,

00:14:00.400 --> 00:14:02.783 align:middle line:84%
even though David this
is not really his name.

00:14:02.783 --> 00:14:05.200 align:middle line:84%
But David called me one morning,
and he asked me, he said,

00:14:05.200 --> 00:14:09.070 align:middle line:84%
Gregg, would you like to
meet me and accompany me

00:14:09.070 --> 00:14:12.220 align:middle line:84%
to a place that is
so old, no one even

00:14:12.220 --> 00:14:13.600 align:middle line:90%
knows who built this place.

00:14:13.600 --> 00:14:16.580 align:middle line:84%
It was built by the
hands of our ancestors.

00:14:16.580 --> 00:14:18.170 align:middle line:90%
It is a wheel.

00:14:18.170 --> 00:14:21.730 align:middle line:84%
It is a circle of stone
where we offer our prayers,

00:14:21.730 --> 00:14:24.550 align:middle line:84%
because in this place, the
skin between the worlds

00:14:24.550 --> 00:14:25.390 align:middle line:90%
is very thin.

00:14:25.390 --> 00:14:27.393 align:middle line:90%
I love that terminology.

00:14:27.393 --> 00:14:28.810 align:middle line:84%
So he said, would
you like to join

00:14:28.810 --> 00:14:30.525 align:middle line:90%
me to offer a prayer of rain.

00:14:30.525 --> 00:14:31.900 align:middle line:84%
And I didn't have
to think twice.

00:14:31.900 --> 00:14:33.080 align:middle line:90%
I said, you bet.

00:14:33.080 --> 00:14:33.880 align:middle line:90%
And I met David.

00:14:33.880 --> 00:14:35.950 align:middle line:90%
And we hiked into this place.

00:14:35.950 --> 00:14:37.960 align:middle line:84%
I wasn't prepared
for what I saw.

00:14:37.960 --> 00:14:41.440 align:middle line:84%
As an Anglo, as a
Westerner, I expected

00:14:41.440 --> 00:14:44.830 align:middle line:84%
to see some chanting,
some kind of ceremony,

00:14:44.830 --> 00:14:46.225 align:middle line:90%
maybe some dancing.

00:14:46.225 --> 00:14:47.495 align:middle line:90%
And what I saw was David.

00:14:47.495 --> 00:14:48.370 align:middle line:90%
He sat on the ground.

00:14:48.370 --> 00:14:49.690 align:middle line:90%
He took off his old work boots.

00:14:49.690 --> 00:14:51.760 align:middle line:84%
He unlaced them and put
them outside the circle.

00:14:51.760 --> 00:14:56.270 align:middle line:84%
He stepped into the circle with
his naked feet on the ground.

00:14:56.270 --> 00:14:57.710 align:middle line:90%
He closed his eyes.

00:14:57.710 --> 00:14:59.420 align:middle line:90%
He honored all of his ancestors.

00:14:59.420 --> 00:15:03.180 align:middle line:84%
He honored the directions,
all six of them.

00:15:03.180 --> 00:15:04.990 align:middle line:84%
And then he closed his
eyes with his hands

00:15:04.990 --> 00:15:08.900 align:middle line:84%
in the prayer mudra over his
heart, just for a few seconds.

00:15:08.900 --> 00:15:11.973 align:middle line:84%
This was outside of the
town of Taos, New Mexico.

00:15:11.973 --> 00:15:13.390 align:middle line:84%
It's the nearest
city of any size.

00:15:13.390 --> 00:15:14.715 align:middle line:90%
And he looked at me.

00:15:14.715 --> 00:15:16.090 align:middle line:84%
He opened his eyes
and he looked.

00:15:16.090 --> 00:15:17.950 align:middle line:90%
And he said, I'm hungry.

00:15:17.950 --> 00:15:19.200 align:middle line:90%
You want to get a bite to eat?

00:15:19.200 --> 00:15:20.408 align:middle line:90%
And he was inside the circle.

00:15:20.408 --> 00:15:21.350 align:middle line:90%
And I said, well, yes.

00:15:21.350 --> 00:15:24.347 align:middle line:84%
But I said, but I thought you
were going to pray for rain.

00:15:24.347 --> 00:15:25.180 align:middle line:90%
And he looked at me.

00:15:25.180 --> 00:15:28.490 align:middle line:84%
And what he said has stayed with
me so powerfully for so long.

00:15:28.490 --> 00:15:30.700 align:middle line:84%
And it's helped so many
people when they think

00:15:30.700 --> 00:15:32.630 align:middle line:90%
about how this prayer works.

00:15:32.630 --> 00:15:33.430 align:middle line:90%
He looked at me.

00:15:33.430 --> 00:15:34.990 align:middle line:90%
And he said, no.

00:15:34.990 --> 00:15:40.580 align:middle line:84%
He said, if I prayed for
rain, rain could never happen.

00:15:40.580 --> 00:15:44.320 align:middle line:84%
He said, because the
moment I pray for rain,

00:15:44.320 --> 00:15:49.010 align:middle line:84%
I have just told the universe
that rain does not exist here.

00:15:49.010 --> 00:15:51.700 align:middle line:84%
The moment I pray
for it to happen,

00:15:51.700 --> 00:15:54.745 align:middle line:84%
I'm acknowledging that
it's not here now.

00:15:54.745 --> 00:15:57.370 align:middle line:84%
And I said, well, if you didn't
pray for rain just now, I said,

00:15:57.370 --> 00:16:00.410 align:middle line:84%
when you closed your eyes,
what did you just do?

00:16:00.410 --> 00:16:02.350 align:middle line:84%
And he said, when
I close my eyes,

00:16:02.350 --> 00:16:06.370 align:middle line:84%
he said, I felt the feeling
of what it feels like when

00:16:06.370 --> 00:16:08.470 align:middle line:90%
it rains in my Pueblo village.

00:16:08.470 --> 00:16:11.020 align:middle line:84%
He said, I felt
the feeling of what

00:16:11.020 --> 00:16:14.207 align:middle line:84%
it feels like to stand with
my naked feet in the mud,

00:16:14.207 --> 00:16:16.540 align:middle line:84%
and the mud is there, because
there's been so much rain.

00:16:16.540 --> 00:16:19.960 align:middle line:84%
He said, I smelled
the smells of what

00:16:19.960 --> 00:16:22.660 align:middle line:84%
the rain smells like when
it rolls off the earthen

00:16:22.660 --> 00:16:24.880 align:middle line:90%
walls from our Pueblo.

00:16:24.880 --> 00:16:27.760 align:middle line:84%
And I felt what it
would feel like to walk

00:16:27.760 --> 00:16:30.693 align:middle line:84%
through the corn that's this
high against my naked chest,

00:16:30.693 --> 00:16:32.860 align:middle line:84%
and it's this high because
there's been so much rain

00:16:32.860 --> 00:16:34.120 align:middle line:90%
to grow the corn.

00:16:34.120 --> 00:16:36.940 align:middle line:84%
And then I give thanks of
gratitude and appreciation

00:16:36.940 --> 00:16:40.180 align:middle line:84%
for the rain that
has already happened.

00:16:40.180 --> 00:16:42.940 align:middle line:84%
Can you see now,
through everything

00:16:42.940 --> 00:16:45.083 align:middle line:84%
that we have
explored, everything

00:16:45.083 --> 00:16:46.750 align:middle line:84%
we've discovered in
this series, can you

00:16:46.750 --> 00:16:48.880 align:middle line:90%
see what David has just done?

00:16:48.880 --> 00:16:51.217 align:middle line:84%
He's brought together
so many of the concepts.

00:16:51.217 --> 00:16:53.800 align:middle line:84%
He's acknowledging that there's
a field out there, number one,

00:16:53.800 --> 00:16:56.170 align:middle line:84%
that he's communicating
with that field.

00:16:56.170 --> 00:16:59.770 align:middle line:84%
He's acknowledging that
the feeling is the language

00:16:59.770 --> 00:17:02.860 align:middle line:84%
that the field recognizes is
not so much about the words.

00:17:02.860 --> 00:17:04.720 align:middle line:90%
The words can be spoken.

00:17:04.720 --> 00:17:06.609 align:middle line:84%
However, if the
words are spoken,

00:17:06.609 --> 00:17:09.730 align:middle line:84%
the goal is to
create the feeling.

00:17:09.730 --> 00:17:12.040 align:middle line:84%
And he's acknowledging
that he has

00:17:12.040 --> 00:17:17.980 align:middle line:84%
the potential as a man, a human
in the presence of this field

00:17:17.980 --> 00:17:22.930 align:middle line:84%
to reach inside of the field
into the realm of all things

00:17:22.930 --> 00:17:26.450 align:middle line:84%
that are possible and isolate
the possibility of his choice

00:17:26.450 --> 00:17:30.430 align:middle line:84%
and collapse that potential into
something real in our world.

00:17:30.430 --> 00:17:32.500 align:middle line:84%
And he's doing it through
a very sophisticated

00:17:32.500 --> 00:17:35.930 align:middle line:84%
internal technology that we
call the lost mode of prayer.

00:17:35.930 --> 00:17:37.330 align:middle line:90%
It is a feeling-based prayer.

00:17:37.330 --> 00:17:38.410 align:middle line:90%
The key?

00:17:38.410 --> 00:17:41.230 align:middle line:84%
Feeling as if the prayer
is already answered,

00:17:41.230 --> 00:17:43.780 align:middle line:90%
coming from the outcome.

00:17:43.780 --> 00:17:46.930 align:middle line:84%
There is a huge
difference between working

00:17:46.930 --> 00:17:50.410 align:middle line:84%
toward the outcome
a little at a time

00:17:50.410 --> 00:17:53.850 align:middle line:90%
and beginning with the outcome.

00:17:53.850 --> 00:17:56.590 align:middle line:84%
And you've probably seen this
huge difference in your life

00:17:56.590 --> 00:17:57.390 align:middle line:90%
as a child.

00:17:57.390 --> 00:17:58.230 align:middle line:90%
I know that I did.

00:17:58.230 --> 00:18:01.110 align:middle line:84%
For example, I was
told when I was young,

00:18:01.110 --> 00:18:03.440 align:middle line:84%
if I scraped my knee
on the sidewalk,

00:18:03.440 --> 00:18:07.320 align:middle line:84%
that the healing is going
to happen slowly, gradually,

00:18:07.320 --> 00:18:08.490 align:middle line:90%
over a period of time.

00:18:08.490 --> 00:18:09.390 align:middle line:90%
And you know what?

00:18:09.390 --> 00:18:12.280 align:middle line:84%
Sure enough, that's exactly
the way it happened.

00:18:12.280 --> 00:18:13.590 align:middle line:90%
I would look and expect.

00:18:13.590 --> 00:18:15.990 align:middle line:84%
My mom told me, she
said, every day, it's

00:18:15.990 --> 00:18:18.450 align:middle line:84%
going to get a little bit
better, a little bit better,

00:18:18.450 --> 00:18:18.940 align:middle line:90%
a little bit better.

00:18:18.940 --> 00:18:20.310 align:middle line:90%
And I'd look, and she was right.

00:18:20.310 --> 00:18:21.780 align:middle line:84%
It was getting a little
better, a little better,

00:18:21.780 --> 00:18:22.680 align:middle line:90%
and a little better.

00:18:22.680 --> 00:18:26.070 align:middle line:84%
Is it possible that when we look
at our bodies with that kind

00:18:26.070 --> 00:18:28.980 align:middle line:84%
of expectation that the
healing actually reflects,

00:18:28.980 --> 00:18:31.120 align:middle line:90%
it mirrors our expectation?

00:18:31.120 --> 00:18:33.750 align:middle line:84%
And if that is true,
what would happen

00:18:33.750 --> 00:18:35.823 align:middle line:90%
if we begin with the outcome?

00:18:35.823 --> 00:18:37.740 align:middle line:84%
I want to tell you, I've
done this in my life.

00:18:37.740 --> 00:18:38.640 align:middle line:90%
And it has worked.

00:18:38.640 --> 00:18:41.080 align:middle line:84%
And that's why I can sit here
and look at you right now.

00:18:41.080 --> 00:18:44.890 align:middle line:84%
And I can tell you, I know that
this modality of prayer works.

00:18:44.890 --> 00:18:46.500 align:middle line:84%
And when we talk
about prayer, we're

00:18:46.500 --> 00:18:49.290 align:middle line:84%
talking about this as a code
interacting with creation.

00:18:49.290 --> 00:18:51.602 align:middle line:84%
This has nothing to do with
any religion whatsoever.

00:18:51.602 --> 00:18:53.310 align:middle line:84%
And I want to be really
clear about that.

00:18:53.310 --> 00:18:57.060 align:middle line:84%
Although religions have
wrapped the rules and the dogma

00:18:57.060 --> 00:19:01.650 align:middle line:84%
around these deeply spiritual
principles in the past,

00:19:01.650 --> 00:19:06.340 align:middle line:84%
it actually led to people in
some respects feeling further

00:19:06.340 --> 00:19:07.140 align:middle line:90%
from their power.

00:19:07.140 --> 00:19:09.575 align:middle line:84%
It has disempowered the people,
the rules and the dogma.

00:19:09.575 --> 00:19:11.700 align:middle line:84%
So we're cutting right
through the rules and dogma.

00:19:11.700 --> 00:19:16.950 align:middle line:84%
We're going to the essence of
our most ancient and cherished

00:19:16.950 --> 00:19:18.550 align:middle line:90%
spiritual technology.

00:19:18.550 --> 00:19:20.520 align:middle line:84%
It's about the
relationship between you

00:19:20.520 --> 00:19:24.480 align:middle line:84%
and me, the field, the Earth,
the heavens, the cosmos,

00:19:24.480 --> 00:19:26.220 align:middle line:90%
and our bodies.

00:19:26.220 --> 00:19:31.620 align:middle line:84%
So I've had the opportunity to
begin my healing from the place

00:19:31.620 --> 00:19:34.290 align:middle line:84%
where we are
conditioned to think

00:19:34.290 --> 00:19:37.530 align:middle line:84%
that it leads, to feel the
feeling as if the healing has

00:19:37.530 --> 00:19:38.820 align:middle line:90%
already happened.

00:19:38.820 --> 00:19:40.710 align:middle line:84%
In other programs,
I've talked about this.

00:19:40.710 --> 00:19:42.502 align:middle line:84%
I went through a physical
in the year 2000.

00:19:42.502 --> 00:19:44.440 align:middle line:84%
There was a tumor
inside my bladder

00:19:44.440 --> 00:19:48.450 align:middle line:84%
that doctors wanted to
operate on physically.

00:19:48.450 --> 00:19:49.860 align:middle line:90%
I acknowledged that.

00:19:49.860 --> 00:19:52.770 align:middle line:84%
I applied everything that
I had learned in my life.

00:19:52.770 --> 00:19:54.570 align:middle line:90%
And I really applied it.

00:19:54.570 --> 00:19:56.820 align:middle line:90%
I didn't just kind of apply it.

00:19:56.820 --> 00:20:00.660 align:middle line:84%
I lived the deepest truth,
the existence, everything

00:20:00.660 --> 00:20:02.400 align:middle line:84%
that I'm saying to
you in this program.

00:20:02.400 --> 00:20:03.520 align:middle line:90%
And it takes work.

00:20:03.520 --> 00:20:05.130 align:middle line:90%
It takes work to do that.

00:20:05.130 --> 00:20:06.400 align:middle line:90%
And I did that work.

00:20:06.400 --> 00:20:08.880 align:middle line:84%
And when I went back,
fully prepared for surgery

00:20:08.880 --> 00:20:11.100 align:middle line:84%
if it was needed,
what the doctors found

00:20:11.100 --> 00:20:12.930 align:middle line:84%
was there's no need
for the surgery,

00:20:12.930 --> 00:20:14.910 align:middle line:84%
I've done this with cuts
and scrapes as well.

00:20:14.910 --> 00:20:16.390 align:middle line:90%
Our bodies will respond.

00:20:16.390 --> 00:20:17.570 align:middle line:90%
We're part of the field.

00:20:17.570 --> 00:20:19.020 align:middle line:90%
We're emerging from this field.

00:20:19.020 --> 00:20:21.690 align:middle line:84%
And we communicate with
the field in a language

00:20:21.690 --> 00:20:24.210 align:middle line:84%
that recognizes
emotion, feeling,

00:20:24.210 --> 00:20:25.990 align:middle line:84%
just like David
did with the rain.

00:20:25.990 --> 00:20:27.330 align:middle line:90%
Then the field responds.

00:20:27.330 --> 00:20:29.810 align:middle line:84%
So let me tell you what
happened with the rain.

00:20:29.810 --> 00:20:32.070 align:middle line:10%
Dave and I went into
Taos, New Mexico.

00:20:32.070 --> 00:20:34.170 align:middle line:84%
We had lunch about an
hour south of where

00:20:34.170 --> 00:20:37.290 align:middle line:90%
this prayer was offered.

00:20:37.290 --> 00:20:38.888 align:middle line:84%
By the time I got
back onto my land,

00:20:38.888 --> 00:20:41.430 align:middle line:84%
something began to happen that
we hadn't seen in a long time.

00:20:41.430 --> 00:20:44.340 align:middle line:84%
Big black clouds came in over
the Sangha de Cristo mountains.

00:20:44.340 --> 00:20:45.810 align:middle line:90%
And it started to rain.

00:20:45.810 --> 00:20:46.990 align:middle line:90%
And it rained.

00:20:46.990 --> 00:20:48.490 align:middle line:84%
And it rained and
rained and rained.

00:20:48.490 --> 00:20:49.875 align:middle line:90%
It rained all that night.

00:20:49.875 --> 00:20:51.000 align:middle line:90%
It rained the next morning.

00:20:51.000 --> 00:20:53.310 align:middle line:90%
It rained the next afternoon.

00:20:53.310 --> 00:20:54.700 align:middle line:90%
It rained and rained.

00:20:54.700 --> 00:20:55.500 align:middle line:90%
It rained so much.

00:20:55.500 --> 00:20:57.900 align:middle line:84%
The ground was so dry, it
couldn't absorb the rain.

00:20:57.900 --> 00:20:59.160 align:middle line:90%
And everything began to flood.

00:20:59.160 --> 00:21:00.060 align:middle line:90%
Fields were flooded.

00:21:00.060 --> 00:21:01.080 align:middle line:90%
Cattle were stranded.

00:21:01.080 --> 00:21:03.052 align:middle line:90%
Roads were washed out.

00:21:03.052 --> 00:21:04.567 align:middle line:84%
And I called my
friend on the phone.

00:21:04.567 --> 00:21:06.150 align:middle line:84%
I'm just going to
share this with you.

00:21:06.150 --> 00:21:07.220 align:middle line:90%
I called my friend on the phone.

00:21:07.220 --> 00:21:08.845 align:middle line:84%
And I said, David,
man, this is a mess.

00:21:08.845 --> 00:21:10.830 align:middle line:90%
I said, what is happening.

00:21:10.830 --> 00:21:12.650 align:middle line:84%
And he was quiet
just for a moment.

00:21:12.650 --> 00:21:14.120 align:middle line:84%
And he said, Gregg,
that's the part

00:21:14.120 --> 00:21:16.250 align:middle line:84%
of the prayer our ancestors
could never figure out.

00:21:16.250 --> 00:21:18.590 align:middle line:84%
He said, they could
tell it to rain,

00:21:18.590 --> 00:21:21.170 align:middle line:84%
but they couldn't tell
it how much to rain.

00:21:21.170 --> 00:21:23.775 align:middle line:84%
So I cannot prove to
you scientifically that

00:21:23.775 --> 00:21:26.150 align:middle line:84%
David's prayer had anything
to do with the rain that came

00:21:26.150 --> 00:21:27.230 align:middle line:90%
in that afternoon.

00:21:27.230 --> 00:21:29.678 align:middle line:84%
I cannot prove that
to you as a scientist.

00:21:29.678 --> 00:21:31.220 align:middle line:84%
As a scientist, what
I have to say is

00:21:31.220 --> 00:21:34.040 align:middle line:84%
there's a high correlation
between the rain that

00:21:34.040 --> 00:21:36.290 align:middle line:84%
appeared that hadn't
been seen in a long time

00:21:36.290 --> 00:21:39.138 align:middle line:84%
and what David had just
done hours earlier.

00:21:39.138 --> 00:21:40.430 align:middle line:90%
And the weatherman would agree.

00:21:40.430 --> 00:21:42.340 align:middle line:84%
I watched the
weatherman that evening.

00:21:42.340 --> 00:21:44.210 align:middle line:84%
And on the weather
maps, what they showed

00:21:44.210 --> 00:21:48.810 align:middle line:84%
was a low pressure front that
came across Utah, Wyoming,

00:21:48.810 --> 00:21:50.990 align:middle line:84%
and it came in the
Colorado and then down

00:21:50.990 --> 00:21:52.670 align:middle line:90%
into northern New Mexico.

00:21:52.670 --> 00:21:54.740 align:middle line:84%
And it made a little loop
and went right back up.

00:21:54.740 --> 00:21:56.450 align:middle line:10%
And that low pressure
system is what

00:21:56.450 --> 00:21:59.010 align:middle line:10%
brought the rain to that place.

00:21:59.010 --> 00:22:01.190 align:middle line:84%
So when we talk about
these things, some of these

00:22:01.190 --> 00:22:02.660 align:middle line:84%
are anecdotal
stories, but they're

00:22:02.660 --> 00:22:06.310 align:middle line:84%
illustrating, from an indigenous
perspective, a very powerful

00:22:06.310 --> 00:22:07.110 align:middle line:90%
concept.

00:22:07.110 --> 00:22:08.690 align:middle line:90%
Look at what David did.

00:22:08.690 --> 00:22:11.060 align:middle line:84%
He incorporated
all of his senses.

00:22:11.060 --> 00:22:13.160 align:middle line:84%
He didn't ask for
something to happen.

00:22:13.160 --> 00:22:14.630 align:middle line:90%
He felt it had already happened.

00:22:14.630 --> 00:22:17.870 align:middle line:84%
He smelled what it smells
like when it happens.

00:22:17.870 --> 00:22:19.305 align:middle line:90%
He heard the sounds of the rain.

00:22:19.305 --> 00:22:20.930 align:middle line:84%
I didn't even tell
you about that part.

00:22:20.930 --> 00:22:23.080 align:middle line:84%
But he heard the
sounds of the rain.

00:22:23.080 --> 00:22:25.698 align:middle line:84%
And he felt as if that
rain is already there.

00:22:25.698 --> 00:22:27.740 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to invite you
to think about this as we

00:22:27.740 --> 00:22:30.080 align:middle line:84%
go in to this modality
of prayer that I'm

00:22:30.080 --> 00:22:31.520 align:middle line:90%
going to share with you.

00:22:31.520 --> 00:22:34.220 align:middle line:84%
So the principles that
I'm sharing in this mode

00:22:34.220 --> 00:22:35.130 align:middle line:90%
are very simple.

00:22:35.130 --> 00:22:37.155 align:middle line:90%
They're also very ancient.

00:22:37.155 --> 00:22:38.530 align:middle line:84%
And everything
I'm saying to you,

00:22:38.530 --> 00:22:42.330 align:middle line:84%
we see the instructions
for this kind of prayer,

00:22:42.330 --> 00:22:47.030 align:middle line:84%
for this code that allows us to
speak directly to the matrix.

00:22:47.030 --> 00:22:51.620 align:middle line:84%
We see these principles recorded
in some of our most ancient

00:22:51.620 --> 00:22:54.530 align:middle line:90%
cherished spiritual traditions.

00:22:54.530 --> 00:22:56.810 align:middle line:84%
And I'm talking about
lost biblical books

00:22:56.810 --> 00:22:59.703 align:middle line:84%
that I described
earlier in this program.

00:22:59.703 --> 00:23:01.370 align:middle line:84%
These are the books
that were discovered

00:23:01.370 --> 00:23:06.250 align:middle line:84%
in the mid-20th century as the
Nag Hammadi library in Egypt.

00:23:06.250 --> 00:23:08.535 align:middle line:84%
Remember, the Dead Sea
Scrolls are the oldest records

00:23:08.535 --> 00:23:09.410 align:middle line:90%
of the Old Testament.

00:23:09.410 --> 00:23:12.523 align:middle line:84%
The Nag Hammadi library
are the oldest records

00:23:12.523 --> 00:23:13.940 align:middle line:84%
of the New Testament,
both of them

00:23:13.940 --> 00:23:17.790 align:middle line:84%
found mid-20th
century, the 1940s.

00:23:17.790 --> 00:23:21.230 align:middle line:84%
And in that Nag Hammadi
library, the 43-plus books

00:23:21.230 --> 00:23:23.990 align:middle line:84%
that were completely removed
from the biblical canon

00:23:23.990 --> 00:23:26.690 align:middle line:84%
in the fourth century by
the Emperor Constantine

00:23:26.690 --> 00:23:30.620 align:middle line:84%
were intact in the Nag Hammadi
library, including the "Gospel

00:23:30.620 --> 00:23:33.440 align:middle line:84%
of Thomas" that we've
spoken about earlier, Thomas

00:23:33.440 --> 00:23:37.880 align:middle line:84%
the scribe that followed the
master Jesus, the teacher, not

00:23:37.880 --> 00:23:40.280 align:middle line:84%
a religious man from
this perspective.

00:23:40.280 --> 00:23:42.080 align:middle line:10%
He followed the teacher.

00:23:42.080 --> 00:23:45.830 align:middle line:10%
And he recorded the words, the
exact words of the teacher.

00:23:45.830 --> 00:23:48.770 align:middle line:84%
And this is important, because
there is a place in the "Gospel

00:23:48.770 --> 00:23:53.420 align:middle line:84%
of Thomas" where his students
asked the teacher how

00:23:53.420 --> 00:23:55.380 align:middle line:90%
to communicate with the field.

00:23:55.380 --> 00:23:57.380 align:middle line:90%
They didn't use those terms.

00:23:57.380 --> 00:24:00.020 align:middle line:84%
They asked how to
communicate with God.

00:24:00.020 --> 00:24:01.520 align:middle line:84%
And it's in the
"Gospel of Thomas"

00:24:01.520 --> 00:24:04.760 align:middle line:84%
that we find the instructions
for the fifth mode, the lost

00:24:04.760 --> 00:24:06.260 align:middle line:90%
mode of prayer.

00:24:06.260 --> 00:24:07.760 align:middle line:84%
Now, I mentioned
earlier that you've

00:24:07.760 --> 00:24:11.210 align:middle line:84%
heard the term when something
is lost in translation.

00:24:11.210 --> 00:24:12.800 align:middle line:84%
And it is this
translation that I'm

00:24:12.800 --> 00:24:15.140 align:middle line:84%
going to share with you
from this biblical book

00:24:15.140 --> 00:24:18.950 align:middle line:84%
after its discovery that is a
beautiful example of just how

00:24:18.950 --> 00:24:21.680 align:middle line:84%
much a difference, one
difference, an error

00:24:21.680 --> 00:24:24.340 align:middle line:90%
in translation can make.

00:24:24.340 --> 00:24:26.400 align:middle line:84%
So it's in the
"Gospel of Thomas"

00:24:26.400 --> 00:24:29.520 align:middle line:84%
that we actually
find the instructions

00:24:29.520 --> 00:24:33.360 align:middle line:84%
for this fifth or this lost
mode of prayer, as I mentioned.

00:24:33.360 --> 00:24:37.380 align:middle line:84%
So let me first read
to you the translation

00:24:37.380 --> 00:24:40.470 align:middle line:84%
in the authorized version
of the King James Bible

00:24:40.470 --> 00:24:41.345 align:middle line:90%
as we see it today.

00:24:41.345 --> 00:24:42.970 align:middle line:84%
If you'd like to see
this for yourself,

00:24:42.970 --> 00:24:47.220 align:middle line:84%
it's in King James version of
the book of John, 16 through 23

00:24:47.220 --> 00:24:48.567 align:middle line:90%
is where you would find this.

00:24:48.567 --> 00:24:49.900 align:middle line:90%
I know you've heard this before.

00:24:49.900 --> 00:24:52.762 align:middle line:84%
How many of you have heard,
"Ask, and Ye shall receive?"

00:24:52.762 --> 00:24:53.970 align:middle line:90%
That's where this comes from.

00:24:53.970 --> 00:24:56.130 align:middle line:90%
Let me read you the translation.

00:24:56.130 --> 00:24:59.150 align:middle line:84%
The translation goes
like this, "Whatsoever ye

00:24:59.150 --> 00:25:02.070 align:middle line:84%
ask the father in my name,
he will give it to you.

00:25:02.070 --> 00:25:06.000 align:middle line:84%
Ask, and ye shall receive
that your joy may be full."

00:25:06.000 --> 00:25:08.790 align:middle line:84%
And that's the end
of the translation.

00:25:08.790 --> 00:25:09.753 align:middle line:90%
I don't know about you.

00:25:09.753 --> 00:25:11.670 align:middle line:84%
When I was a kid, I would
ask and ask and ask,

00:25:11.670 --> 00:25:12.753 align:middle line:90%
and not much would happen.

00:25:12.753 --> 00:25:15.230 align:middle line:84%
And I became very frustrated,
and many people do.

00:25:15.230 --> 00:25:16.320 align:middle line:90%
And we feel powerless.

00:25:16.320 --> 00:25:19.500 align:middle line:84%
We feel that our prayers really
aren't making any difference,

00:25:19.500 --> 00:25:24.960 align:middle line:84%
because we're not seeing
any way to reinforce

00:25:24.960 --> 00:25:27.080 align:middle line:84%
that our prayers have
actually done something

00:25:27.080 --> 00:25:28.305 align:middle line:90%
that made a difference.

00:25:28.305 --> 00:25:32.490 align:middle line:84%
I want to go back into the
original Aramaic translation

00:25:32.490 --> 00:25:33.810 align:middle line:90%
and Greek and Aramaic both.

00:25:33.810 --> 00:25:36.420 align:middle line:84%
But this is going to be
from the original Aramaic.

00:25:36.420 --> 00:25:39.180 align:middle line:84%
In the "Gospel of Thomas,"
you see Greek and Aramaic

00:25:39.180 --> 00:25:40.910 align:middle line:90%
is why I'm clarifying this.

00:25:40.910 --> 00:25:43.370 align:middle line:84%
And I want to read you--
and it's very close,

00:25:43.370 --> 00:25:47.010 align:middle line:84%
but there is a powerful
and subtle difference

00:25:47.010 --> 00:25:48.900 align:middle line:84%
that was left out
in the translation.

00:25:48.900 --> 00:25:52.590 align:middle line:84%
And it may very well be
because the translators did not

00:25:52.590 --> 00:25:55.020 align:middle line:84%
understand what you and I
are exploring right now.

00:25:55.020 --> 00:25:56.700 align:middle line:84%
And because they
didn't understand it,

00:25:56.700 --> 00:25:59.560 align:middle line:84%
they simply streamlined
the language.

00:25:59.560 --> 00:26:02.465 align:middle line:84%
So in the translated
version, if you'd

00:26:02.465 --> 00:26:03.840 align:middle line:84%
like to see this
for yourself, it

00:26:03.840 --> 00:26:09.118 align:middle line:84%
comes from Neil Douglas Clotes
is the name of the translator.

00:26:09.118 --> 00:26:11.160 align:middle line:84%
It's a little bit called
"Prayers of the Cosmos."

00:26:11.160 --> 00:26:12.535 align:middle line:84%
It is a beautiful,
beautiful book

00:26:12.535 --> 00:26:15.930 align:middle line:84%
where he re-translates so many
of the very powerful prayers.

00:26:15.930 --> 00:26:17.040 align:middle line:90%
And this is one of them.

00:26:17.040 --> 00:26:18.840 align:middle line:90%
Now, listen to the difference.

00:26:18.840 --> 00:26:22.230 align:middle line:84%
In the original text, it
begins a very similar way.

00:26:22.230 --> 00:26:25.320 align:middle line:84%
Quote, "All things that you
asked straightly, directly,

00:26:25.320 --> 00:26:27.960 align:middle line:84%
from inside my name,
you'll be given."

00:26:27.960 --> 00:26:31.870 align:middle line:84%
OK, now here comes the
translation that was in error.

00:26:31.870 --> 00:26:33.360 align:middle line:90%
This is the original.

00:26:33.360 --> 00:26:38.790 align:middle line:84%
"Ask without hidden motive, and
be surrounded by your answer.

00:26:38.790 --> 00:26:42.900 align:middle line:84%
Be enveloped by what you desire
that your gladness be full."

00:26:42.900 --> 00:26:45.690 align:middle line:84%
That is a single, very
powerful statement.

00:26:45.690 --> 00:26:47.430 align:middle line:84%
And I'm going to
break this down.

00:26:47.430 --> 00:26:49.530 align:middle line:90%
"Ask without hidden motive."

00:26:49.530 --> 00:26:52.540 align:middle line:84%
That is inviting you to
ask without attachment

00:26:52.540 --> 00:26:53.340 align:middle line:90%
to the outcome.

00:26:53.340 --> 00:26:55.350 align:middle line:84%
It's actually a very
Buddhist concept.

00:26:55.350 --> 00:26:58.200 align:middle line:84%
Ask without attachment to
the rightness, the wrongness,

00:26:58.200 --> 00:27:00.480 align:middle line:84%
the goodness, the
badness, or the joy

00:27:00.480 --> 00:27:03.150 align:middle line:84%
or the disappointment
as to whether or not

00:27:03.150 --> 00:27:06.980 align:middle line:84%
your prayer is answered, without
attachment to the outcome.

00:27:06.980 --> 00:27:10.620 align:middle line:90%
Be surrounded by your answer.

00:27:10.620 --> 00:27:13.590 align:middle line:90%
Be enveloped by what you desire.

00:27:13.590 --> 00:27:17.640 align:middle line:84%
The only way to be is if those
things are already present,

00:27:17.640 --> 00:27:19.290 align:middle line:90%
your prayer is already answered.

00:27:19.290 --> 00:27:22.350 align:middle line:84%
You're coming from the place
that the prayer has already

00:27:22.350 --> 00:27:23.500 align:middle line:90%
been answered.

00:27:23.500 --> 00:27:26.460 align:middle line:84%
So the key to what we're
saying here, feel the feeling.

00:27:26.460 --> 00:27:29.100 align:middle line:84%
Feel as if the
prayer was already

00:27:29.100 --> 00:27:33.670 align:middle line:84%
answered with as many senses as
you can, smell, touch, taste,

00:27:33.670 --> 00:27:34.470 align:middle line:90%
hearing.

00:27:34.470 --> 00:27:36.990 align:middle line:84%
Feel as if your body
is already healed.

00:27:36.990 --> 00:27:39.000 align:middle line:84%
Feel as if your
perfect relationship

00:27:39.000 --> 00:27:40.410 align:middle line:90%
is already present.

00:27:40.410 --> 00:27:42.960 align:middle line:10%
Feel as if your abundance
is already present.

00:27:42.960 --> 00:27:46.550 align:middle line:90%
Invoke all of those senses.

00:27:46.550 --> 00:27:50.270 align:middle line:84%
Earlier in the
series, I suggested

00:27:50.270 --> 00:27:55.610 align:middle line:84%
a new model for creation
and the way that works

00:27:55.610 --> 00:28:00.590 align:middle line:84%
and a new philosophy that
says that our creation,

00:28:00.590 --> 00:28:06.470 align:middle line:84%
that consciousness is constantly
informing us of ourselves

00:28:06.470 --> 00:28:07.550 align:middle line:90%
through our creations.

00:28:07.550 --> 00:28:11.660 align:middle line:84%
The things that we create
art, music, books, the things

00:28:11.660 --> 00:28:13.100 align:middle line:84%
that we create
that we believe are

00:28:13.100 --> 00:28:15.950 align:middle line:84%
entertainment or
creative expression,

00:28:15.950 --> 00:28:17.720 align:middle line:84%
in addition to
those things, they

00:28:17.720 --> 00:28:21.260 align:middle line:84%
are actually us informing
us of ourselves,

00:28:21.260 --> 00:28:24.980 align:middle line:84%
informing us of our
relationship to the field

00:28:24.980 --> 00:28:27.410 align:middle line:84%
so that we can remind
ourselves of this very

00:28:27.410 --> 00:28:29.210 align:middle line:90%
powerful internal technology.

00:28:29.210 --> 00:28:32.660 align:middle line:84%
Prayer is a perfect example of
what I'm talking about here.

00:28:32.660 --> 00:28:35.510 align:middle line:84%
Now, I'm going to do this
in a very condensed format

00:28:35.510 --> 00:28:38.000 align:middle line:84%
to give you the sense
for what I'm saying.

00:28:38.000 --> 00:28:40.430 align:middle line:84%
And then you can take this
idea, and you can apply it

00:28:40.430 --> 00:28:41.520 align:middle line:90%
in your own prayers.

00:28:41.520 --> 00:28:44.300 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to give you a
template to do just that.

00:28:44.300 --> 00:28:46.490 align:middle line:84%
I worked in the corporations
and as a scientist,

00:28:46.490 --> 00:28:48.890 align:middle line:84%
as a senior computer
systems designer

00:28:48.890 --> 00:28:50.120 align:middle line:90%
during the Cold War years.

00:28:50.120 --> 00:28:52.460 align:middle line:84%
I understand computer
systems really well.

00:28:52.460 --> 00:28:54.140 align:middle line:84%
And one of the
things that amazed me

00:28:54.140 --> 00:28:56.270 align:middle line:84%
is no matter how
complex or how simple

00:28:56.270 --> 00:29:00.150 align:middle line:84%
they are, whether we're writing
three million lines of code,

00:29:00.150 --> 00:29:03.620 align:middle line:84%
which happens with some of the
systems that are being used

00:29:03.620 --> 00:29:07.520 align:middle line:84%
in the research industry, or
just a couple of lines of code,

00:29:07.520 --> 00:29:10.170 align:middle line:84%
the programs will always
follow the same template.

00:29:10.170 --> 00:29:12.590 align:middle line:10%
Here's the template,
there is always

00:29:12.590 --> 00:29:15.590 align:middle line:10%
an introduction that
tells the program what

00:29:15.590 --> 00:29:16.490 align:middle line:10%
is about to happen.

00:29:16.490 --> 00:29:18.770 align:middle line:10%
They're called
declaration statements.

00:29:18.770 --> 00:29:20.710 align:middle line:10%
Then following the
declaration, there

00:29:20.710 --> 00:29:23.360 align:middle line:10%
is the work, the body of
the program that's actually

00:29:23.360 --> 00:29:25.040 align:middle line:10%
doing the calculations.

00:29:25.040 --> 00:29:27.260 align:middle line:10%
And then there is
a close, something

00:29:27.260 --> 00:29:30.890 align:middle line:10%
to bring the program to closure.

00:29:30.890 --> 00:29:33.920 align:middle line:84%
That is the way that most
sophisticated computer systems

00:29:33.920 --> 00:29:36.140 align:middle line:90%
in our world work today.

00:29:36.140 --> 00:29:39.950 align:middle line:84%
If we are building in our
world, if consciousness

00:29:39.950 --> 00:29:42.830 align:middle line:84%
is informing us in
our world, something

00:29:42.830 --> 00:29:46.100 align:middle line:84%
we know and need to
know about ourselves,

00:29:46.100 --> 00:29:47.925 align:middle line:84%
then the question
is, is it possible

00:29:47.925 --> 00:29:50.300 align:middle line:84%
that those most sophisticated
computers can be telling us

00:29:50.300 --> 00:29:53.210 align:middle line:84%
something about the way we
communicate with the matrix.

00:29:53.210 --> 00:29:55.610 align:middle line:90%
The answer is yes.

00:29:55.610 --> 00:29:59.630 align:middle line:84%
The template that allows the
most sophisticated computers

00:29:59.630 --> 00:30:01.490 align:middle line:84%
in the way to work
the way it works

00:30:01.490 --> 00:30:05.420 align:middle line:84%
is precisely the template
that allows your prayers

00:30:05.420 --> 00:30:07.070 align:middle line:90%
to work the way they work.

00:30:07.070 --> 00:30:09.220 align:middle line:84%
And when you build
your prayers, I'm

00:30:09.220 --> 00:30:11.570 align:middle line:84%
going to invite you
to do precisely this.

00:30:11.570 --> 00:30:14.210 align:middle line:84%
The first statement of
your prayer, a declaration

00:30:14.210 --> 00:30:15.110 align:middle line:90%
statement.

00:30:15.110 --> 00:30:18.260 align:middle line:84%
Tell the field, tell the
matrix, tell consciousness,

00:30:18.260 --> 00:30:21.290 align:middle line:84%
tell God what it is
that you're about to do

00:30:21.290 --> 00:30:23.060 align:middle line:84%
in a single phrase
or a brief sentence.

00:30:23.060 --> 00:30:24.500 align:middle line:90%
Be concise.

00:30:24.500 --> 00:30:27.560 align:middle line:84%
You can simply say, this is a
prayer of healing for my body

00:30:27.560 --> 00:30:30.800 align:middle line:84%
or a prayer of healing
regarding my loved ones.

00:30:30.800 --> 00:30:34.280 align:middle line:84%
And then in the code, what is
it that you want to happen?

00:30:34.280 --> 00:30:36.470 align:middle line:84%
But come from the place
that it's already happened.

00:30:36.470 --> 00:30:38.530 align:middle line:84%
Give thanks for what
has already occurred.

00:30:38.530 --> 00:30:41.060 align:middle line:84%
I give thanks for the
perfection of my body,

00:30:41.060 --> 00:30:43.940 align:middle line:84%
for the healing of my body, for
the healing of my loved ones,

00:30:43.940 --> 00:30:47.780 align:middle line:84%
for the healing of
my relationship.

00:30:47.780 --> 00:30:49.720 align:middle line:90%
This is the body of the code.

00:30:49.720 --> 00:30:52.650 align:middle line:84%
The closure, so beautiful
and so powerful.

00:30:52.650 --> 00:30:54.500 align:middle line:84%
In the closure, we're
telling the field

00:30:54.500 --> 00:30:56.480 align:middle line:90%
that it's already done.

00:30:56.480 --> 00:30:58.370 align:middle line:84%
And for the closure,
the texts invite

00:30:58.370 --> 00:31:00.950 align:middle line:90%
us to use the original Aramaic.

00:31:00.950 --> 00:31:03.530 align:middle line:84%
The original Aramaic, there's
something about these words.

00:31:03.530 --> 00:31:07.400 align:middle line:10%
Let me share them with you, the
words, l'alam al-mein, amen.

00:31:07.400 --> 00:31:09.910 align:middle line:10%


00:31:09.910 --> 00:31:13.430 align:middle line:10%
L'alam al-mein, amen at
the end of your prayer.

00:31:13.430 --> 00:31:14.910 align:middle line:10%
What does that mean?

00:31:14.910 --> 00:31:21.050 align:middle line:10%
It means, I seal this prayer
in trust and faith and truth,

00:31:21.050 --> 00:31:22.580 align:middle line:10%
amen.

00:31:22.580 --> 00:31:27.840 align:middle line:84%
I can't think of a more
powerful, more sophisticated,

00:31:27.840 --> 00:31:31.130 align:middle line:84%
more beautiful
technology that has

00:31:31.130 --> 00:31:33.350 align:middle line:84%
been left to us than our
ability to communicate

00:31:33.350 --> 00:31:34.940 align:middle line:84%
with this field in
a meaningful way.

00:31:34.940 --> 00:31:37.640 align:middle line:84%
And I've just shared
with you one template.

00:31:37.640 --> 00:31:38.840 align:middle line:90%
There may be others.

00:31:38.840 --> 00:31:40.730 align:middle line:84%
This is a very
powerful template that

00:31:40.730 --> 00:31:46.740 align:middle line:84%
was left to us 2,500 years ago
that allows us to do just that.

00:31:46.740 --> 00:31:48.720 align:middle line:84%
The bottom line of
everything I'm saying to you

00:31:48.720 --> 00:31:50.262 align:middle line:84%
is, through the
fifth mode of prayer,

00:31:50.262 --> 00:31:53.370 align:middle line:84%
our feeling-based prayer,
we are given the ability

00:31:53.370 --> 00:31:56.580 align:middle line:84%
to communicate directly
with the possibilities that

00:31:56.580 --> 00:31:59.910 align:middle line:84%
exist in the universal
field, in this divine matrix,

00:31:59.910 --> 00:32:05.310 align:middle line:84%
and to do so in a language
that the matrix recognizes.

00:32:05.310 --> 00:32:08.090 align:middle line:84%
Our most ancient and
cherished spiritual traditions

00:32:08.090 --> 00:32:11.350 align:middle line:84%
have preserved the
knowledge and the technique

00:32:11.350 --> 00:32:13.900 align:middle line:84%
to interact with the
divine matrix and for us

00:32:13.900 --> 00:32:17.830 align:middle line:84%
to rewrite our personal as well
as the global reality code.

00:32:17.830 --> 00:32:20.080 align:middle line:84%
Well, in the next
episode, we'll discover

00:32:20.080 --> 00:32:22.720 align:middle line:84%
why our relationship
with this matrix

00:32:22.720 --> 00:32:26.260 align:middle line:84%
literally holds the key to
the crises that are destroying

00:32:26.260 --> 00:32:28.060 align:middle line:84%
our families and
our communities,

00:32:28.060 --> 00:32:31.230 align:middle line:84%
polarizing our societies
and our nations today.

00:32:31.230 --> 00:32:33.820 align:middle line:84%
So I want to thank you for
joining me for this very

00:32:33.820 --> 00:32:34.870 align:middle line:90%
special presentation.

00:32:34.870 --> 00:32:36.460 align:middle line:84%
