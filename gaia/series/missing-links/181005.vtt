>>GREGG BRADEN: Hello,
my name's Gregg Braden.

00:00:26.470 --> 00:00:29.320 align:middle line:10%
I'd like to welcome you to
this very special presentation

00:00:29.320 --> 00:00:31.030 align:middle line:10%
of "The Divine Matrix"--

00:00:31.030 --> 00:00:34.900 align:middle line:10%
Bridging time and space,
miracles and belief.

00:00:34.900 --> 00:00:36.640 align:middle line:84%
In the last episode,
we discovered

00:00:36.640 --> 00:00:40.000 align:middle line:84%
that almost universally,
ancient texts and traditions,

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:42.640 align:middle line:84%
they've told us that
everything and everyone is

00:00:42.640 --> 00:00:47.200 align:middle line:84%
connected to this mysterious
web or net of energy.

00:00:47.200 --> 00:00:48.970 align:middle line:84%
In this episode,
we'll explore what

00:00:48.970 --> 00:00:52.040 align:middle line:84%
the largest and most
complex machine ever built

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:54.580 align:middle line:84%
has discovered about the
fractions of a second

00:00:54.580 --> 00:00:56.874 align:middle line:90%
immediately after the Big Bang.

00:00:56.874 --> 00:00:58.540 align:middle line:84%
I think the experiments
are fascinating,

00:00:58.540 --> 00:01:02.350 align:middle line:84%
but what's even more fascinating
is the scientific thinking

00:01:02.350 --> 00:01:04.870 align:middle line:84%
that had to change to reflect
what the experiments have

00:01:04.870 --> 00:01:05.830 align:middle line:90%
shown.

00:01:05.830 --> 00:01:07.750 align:middle line:90%
Here's what I mean.

00:01:07.750 --> 00:01:10.180 align:middle line:84%
There was a tremendous
spiritual revolution

00:01:10.180 --> 00:01:12.900 align:middle line:84%
that was sweeping the
Earth in the late 1800s,

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:15.640 align:middle line:84%
and it included the
scientific community.

00:01:15.640 --> 00:01:18.610 align:middle line:84%
Very well-known
scientists were influenced

00:01:18.610 --> 00:01:21.790 align:middle line:84%
by this revolution
and the thinking

00:01:21.790 --> 00:01:25.240 align:middle line:84%
that there is a field of energy
that underlies our existence.

00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:27.400 align:middle line:84%
At that time it was
called the ether.

00:01:27.400 --> 00:01:30.580 align:middle line:84%
It influenced scientists like
Nikola Tesla, Rudolf Steiner,

00:01:30.580 --> 00:01:35.410 align:middle line:84%
Royal Rife, Walter
Russell, even John Keeley.

00:01:35.410 --> 00:01:39.160 align:middle line:84%
So the idea that
this field exists

00:01:39.160 --> 00:01:41.590 align:middle line:84%
was the foundation
of the philosophy

00:01:41.590 --> 00:01:44.380 align:middle line:84%
of these brilliant
men, and it's also

00:01:44.380 --> 00:01:47.290 align:middle line:84%
the idea that allowed their
revolutionary inventions

00:01:47.290 --> 00:01:48.835 align:middle line:84%
to work in the
way that they did.

00:01:48.835 --> 00:01:51.860 align:middle line:84%
It's what made
everything possible.

00:01:51.860 --> 00:01:56.810 align:middle line:10%
For example, Tesla had the idea
of developing a form of power

00:01:56.810 --> 00:01:59.750 align:middle line:10%
that could be shared but not
confined to wires and cables.

00:01:59.750 --> 00:02:02.180 align:middle line:10%
It was called broadcast power.

00:02:02.180 --> 00:02:05.650 align:middle line:10%
So it works much the way a
television station broadcasts

00:02:05.650 --> 00:02:06.450 align:middle line:10%
information.

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:11.240 align:middle line:84%
It is created in a studio, or in
a laboratory, in Tesla's case.

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:14.540 align:middle line:10%
The information would
be sent into the field,

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:16.970 align:middle line:10%
and it would be received
by receivers that knew how

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:19.560 align:middle line:10%
to tune into that information.

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:21.650 align:middle line:84%
Well, that technology
is only possible

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:24.380 align:middle line:84%
if the information is
moving through stuff,

00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:27.110 align:middle line:84%
through something, and that's
what this ether, this field,

00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:28.130 align:middle line:90%
was all about.

00:02:28.130 --> 00:02:31.970 align:middle line:84%
The healing technologies of
Royal Rife and Wilhelm Reich

00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:35.930 align:middle line:84%
work using energy that was
directed toward the body,

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:37.920 align:middle line:84%
didn't physically
touch the body.

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:40.200 align:middle line:84%
And for that healing
to be successful,

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:45.380 align:middle line:84%
it, as well, had to move through
some medium, some conduit, that

00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:48.110 align:middle line:84%
allowed the information to
get from the healing device

00:02:48.110 --> 00:02:49.400 align:middle line:90%
into the body.

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:52.250 align:middle line:84%
John Keely's perpetual energy
machine is the same thing.

00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:53.630 align:middle line:90%
It's true.

00:02:53.630 --> 00:02:57.980 align:middle line:84%
But the idea of the ether,
it's been around even long

00:02:57.980 --> 00:03:00.470 align:middle line:90%
before the 1800s.

00:03:00.470 --> 00:03:04.250 align:middle line:84%
In the 1600s, the father
of science, Isaac Newton,

00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:07.460 align:middle line:84%
he described a field of energy
that he called the ether

00:03:07.460 --> 00:03:10.430 align:middle line:84%
and he used that word to
describe the substance that he

00:03:10.430 --> 00:03:12.680 align:middle line:84%
believed filled the
universe and was

00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:15.170 align:middle line:84%
even responsible for
gravity and the sensations

00:03:15.170 --> 00:03:16.670 align:middle line:90%
in the human body.

00:03:16.670 --> 00:03:19.730 align:middle line:84%
The 19th century scientist,
James Clerk Maxwell,

00:03:19.730 --> 00:03:22.500 align:middle line:84%
the father of
electromagnetic theory,

00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:24.410 align:middle line:84%
he believed that this
ether field exists

00:03:24.410 --> 00:03:26.760 align:middle line:84%
and I want to share--
in his exact words,

00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:28.040 align:middle line:90%
I want to share a quote.

00:03:28.040 --> 00:03:30.950 align:middle line:84%
He said that "a
material substance

00:03:30.950 --> 00:03:33.920 align:middle line:84%
of a more subtle kind,
supposed to exist

00:03:33.920 --> 00:03:37.040 align:middle line:84%
in those parts of space
which are apparently empty,"

00:03:37.040 --> 00:03:39.060 align:middle line:90%
end of quote.

00:03:39.060 --> 00:03:42.720 align:middle line:10%
In 1902, the Nobel Prize
winner Hendrik Lorentz

00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:45.390 align:middle line:10%
developed the equations
that gave Einstein

00:03:45.390 --> 00:03:49.020 align:middle line:10%
the tools to develop his
theory of relativity.

00:03:49.020 --> 00:03:52.770 align:middle line:84%
Lorentz's equations believed
that the ether field exists

00:03:52.770 --> 00:03:54.870 align:middle line:84%
and he said, this
is a quote as well.

00:03:54.870 --> 00:03:59.310 align:middle line:10%
"I cannot but regard the
ether, which can be the seat

00:03:59.310 --> 00:04:03.300 align:middle line:10%
of an electromagnetic field with
its energy and its vibrations,

00:04:03.300 --> 00:04:07.020 align:middle line:10%
however different it may be
from all ordinary matter,"

00:04:07.020 --> 00:04:08.580 align:middle line:10%
end of quote.

00:04:08.580 --> 00:04:09.480 align:middle line:90%
Einstein?

00:04:09.480 --> 00:04:11.530 align:middle line:84%
He believed in this
field, as well.

00:04:11.530 --> 00:04:14.590 align:middle line:84%
But he's described it in a
very, very different way.

00:04:14.590 --> 00:04:19.120 align:middle line:84%
He said simply space without
ether is unthinkable.

00:04:19.120 --> 00:04:21.750 align:middle line:84%
So the point that I'm
making with all of this

00:04:21.750 --> 00:04:24.580 align:middle line:84%
is the sense in the
scientific community

00:04:24.580 --> 00:04:26.580 align:middle line:84%
that there's something
out there that fills what

00:04:26.580 --> 00:04:29.950 align:middle line:90%
we think of as empty space.

00:04:29.950 --> 00:04:34.830 align:middle line:84%
It has been accepted for a very,
very long time until recently.

00:04:34.830 --> 00:04:36.960 align:middle line:84%
It's unacceptable today,
and I'll tell you,

00:04:36.960 --> 00:04:39.960 align:middle line:84%
if you want to clear a
roomful of scientists

00:04:39.960 --> 00:04:43.740 align:middle line:84%
at a scientific conference,
begin your presentation

00:04:43.740 --> 00:04:46.690 align:middle line:84%
by saying, today I'm going to
talk about the ether field.

00:04:46.690 --> 00:04:48.750 align:middle line:84%
And you'll see them get
up and leave the room.

00:04:48.750 --> 00:04:52.440 align:middle line:84%
The term is not even used
today, although the field itself

00:04:52.440 --> 00:04:54.560 align:middle line:90%
is now being validated.

00:04:54.560 --> 00:04:59.910 align:middle line:10%
Well, in 1887, physicist Albert
Michelson and chemist Edward

00:04:59.910 --> 00:05:04.170 align:middle line:10%
Morley, they attempted for the
first time to describe once

00:05:04.170 --> 00:05:09.160 align:middle line:10%
and for all if this mysterious
field actually exists.

00:05:09.160 --> 00:05:11.370 align:middle line:10%
This is the very famous
Michelson Morley experiment

00:05:11.370 --> 00:05:13.830 align:middle line:10%
that I mentioned in
the last episode.

00:05:13.830 --> 00:05:17.100 align:middle line:10%
It was performed in the
basement of Case Western Reserve

00:05:17.100 --> 00:05:19.470 align:middle line:10%
University in Ohio
in the United States,

00:05:19.470 --> 00:05:23.580 align:middle line:10%
in a very nondescript building
where they built a device that

00:05:23.580 --> 00:05:25.950 align:middle line:10%
is called an interferometer.

00:05:25.950 --> 00:05:28.470 align:middle line:10%
Now, the image that you're
seeing on your screen

00:05:28.470 --> 00:05:32.430 align:middle line:10%
is the interferometer, and I'd
like to take just a few moments

00:05:32.430 --> 00:05:35.010 align:middle line:10%
and explain to you what
it is that they were doing

00:05:35.010 --> 00:05:37.740 align:middle line:10%
and what it is that this
experiment revealed.

00:05:37.740 --> 00:05:40.020 align:middle line:84%
So on the left hand
side of the screen,

00:05:40.020 --> 00:05:42.120 align:middle line:90%
you're seeing a source of light.

00:05:42.120 --> 00:05:44.160 align:middle line:84%
The light is being
emitted, it's moving

00:05:44.160 --> 00:05:46.830 align:middle line:84%
to the right toward a
mirror on the right hand

00:05:46.830 --> 00:05:48.400 align:middle line:90%
side of your screen.

00:05:48.400 --> 00:05:52.470 align:middle line:84%
However, to go to that mirror,
before it can get there it

00:05:52.470 --> 00:05:55.620 align:middle line:84%
must pass through
another partial mirror.

00:05:55.620 --> 00:05:58.710 align:middle line:84%
It is called a half
silvered mirror,

00:05:58.710 --> 00:06:02.520 align:middle line:84%
that allows some of the light to
continue to the right and some

00:06:02.520 --> 00:06:05.580 align:middle line:84%
of it to be reflected
to another mirror

00:06:05.580 --> 00:06:07.200 align:middle line:90%
at the top of the screen.

00:06:07.200 --> 00:06:10.540 align:middle line:84%
So the one beam is
being split into two.

00:06:10.540 --> 00:06:12.060 align:middle line:90%
Now here's the thinking.

00:06:12.060 --> 00:06:14.400 align:middle line:84%
Michelson and Morley
proposed that there

00:06:14.400 --> 00:06:18.150 align:middle line:84%
is a field of energy
that surrounds us,

00:06:18.150 --> 00:06:20.430 align:middle line:90%
it permeates the universe.

00:06:20.430 --> 00:06:23.460 align:middle line:84%
It is everywhere all the
time, and they believed

00:06:23.460 --> 00:06:25.590 align:middle line:90%
that the field is in motion.

00:06:25.590 --> 00:06:27.660 align:middle line:90%
They believed it's moving.

00:06:27.660 --> 00:06:31.320 align:middle line:84%
And so their thinking was that
when they shoot a beam of light

00:06:31.320 --> 00:06:34.890 align:middle line:84%
through this field,
if the beam parallels

00:06:34.890 --> 00:06:38.500 align:middle line:84%
the movement of the field,
it's going to move quicker

00:06:38.500 --> 00:06:40.350 align:middle line:90%
and it will be unimpeded.

00:06:40.350 --> 00:06:42.900 align:middle line:84%
If the beam is
perpendicular and it

00:06:42.900 --> 00:06:45.180 align:middle line:84%
has to move through
this field, it's

00:06:45.180 --> 00:06:47.530 align:middle line:84%
going to be slowed
down just a little bit.

00:06:47.530 --> 00:06:52.470 align:middle line:84%
And when that beam is reunited
with the original beam,

00:06:52.470 --> 00:06:54.300 align:middle line:84%
it will create an
interference pattern.

00:06:54.300 --> 00:06:57.720 align:middle line:84%
So let's go back to the image
so I can share with you what

00:06:57.720 --> 00:06:59.179 align:middle line:90%
I mean by this.

00:06:59.179 --> 00:07:00.220 align:middle line:90%
So we're seeing the beam.

00:07:00.220 --> 00:07:03.294 align:middle line:84%
It's coming from the left,
going through the splitter.

00:07:03.294 --> 00:07:05.460 align:middle line:84%
One of the beams is going
straight, one of the beams

00:07:05.460 --> 00:07:06.660 align:middle line:90%
is going to the top.

00:07:06.660 --> 00:07:10.470 align:middle line:84%
Both are being reflected
back to the central mirror,

00:07:10.470 --> 00:07:16.140 align:middle line:84%
and that reunited beam is
now going to a detector.

00:07:16.140 --> 00:07:18.210 align:middle line:84%
In the detector,
the scientists are

00:07:18.210 --> 00:07:20.520 align:middle line:84%
looking for signs of
the interference pattern

00:07:20.520 --> 00:07:22.170 align:middle line:90%
that I just mentioned.

00:07:22.170 --> 00:07:26.010 align:middle line:84%
In the experiments, they
found no interference pattern.

00:07:26.010 --> 00:07:29.340 align:middle line:84%
Now, in a very, very
simple way of thinking

00:07:29.340 --> 00:07:30.840 align:middle line:84%
about this experiment,
if you and I

00:07:30.840 --> 00:07:34.690 align:middle line:84%
were to go outside from whatever
building we're in right now,

00:07:34.690 --> 00:07:36.930 align:middle line:84%
and we have a piece
of tissue paper.

00:07:36.930 --> 00:07:40.920 align:middle line:84%
And we held that tissue paper
in our hand, and in the moment

00:07:40.920 --> 00:07:46.090 align:middle line:84%
we held the tissue, there
was no movement in the paper.

00:07:46.090 --> 00:07:49.350 align:middle line:84%
And if we assume because
the paper is not moving,

00:07:49.350 --> 00:07:52.720 align:middle line:84%
that means there is no wind,
and if we assume because there

00:07:52.720 --> 00:07:56.160 align:middle line:90%
is no wind that no air exists.

00:07:56.160 --> 00:07:58.350 align:middle line:84%
Of course, we know
that that's not true.

00:07:58.350 --> 00:08:01.410 align:middle line:84%
The air exists whether
the wind is moving or not.

00:08:01.410 --> 00:08:05.130 align:middle line:84%
But this is the equivalent of
what Michelson and Morley, what

00:08:05.130 --> 00:08:07.380 align:middle line:84%
they believed this
experiment was showing them.

00:08:07.380 --> 00:08:09.990 align:middle line:84%
Because they saw no
interference pattern,

00:08:09.990 --> 00:08:13.270 align:middle line:84%
they said, we detect no
movement in the field.

00:08:13.270 --> 00:08:16.270 align:middle line:84%
Therefore, the field
must not exist.

00:08:16.270 --> 00:08:19.620 align:middle line:84%
So in 1887, the
scientific papers

00:08:19.620 --> 00:08:22.110 align:middle line:84%
that were published in
peer reviewed journals

00:08:22.110 --> 00:08:24.420 align:middle line:84%
and the information was
accepted by scientists

00:08:24.420 --> 00:08:29.880 align:middle line:84%
from all over the world stated
that there is no field that

00:08:29.880 --> 00:08:31.470 align:middle line:90%
underlies our physical reality.

00:08:31.470 --> 00:08:33.780 align:middle line:90%
That ether field does not exist.

00:08:33.780 --> 00:08:38.280 align:middle line:84%
And from this time in
1887, all of our science

00:08:38.280 --> 00:08:40.830 align:middle line:84%
has been based upon that
belief of separation,

00:08:40.830 --> 00:08:44.070 align:middle line:84%
that everything is separate
from everything else.

00:08:44.070 --> 00:08:46.590 align:middle line:84%
What happens in Point A
has no influence on what's

00:08:46.590 --> 00:08:48.540 align:middle line:90%
happening in Point B.

00:08:48.540 --> 00:08:52.890 align:middle line:84%
Now our science has done
OK without this deeper

00:08:52.890 --> 00:08:54.840 align:middle line:84%
understanding of
our connectivity.

00:08:54.840 --> 00:08:57.960 align:middle line:84%
It's obviously allowed
us to send space probes

00:08:57.960 --> 00:09:01.720 align:middle line:84%
to other planets, and allowed
us to send people to the moon.

00:09:01.720 --> 00:09:04.770 align:middle line:84%
It's allowed us to
take our science only

00:09:04.770 --> 00:09:06.450 align:middle line:90%
to a certain place.

00:09:06.450 --> 00:09:10.160 align:middle line:84%
But now, science has
reached the plateau

00:09:10.160 --> 00:09:12.200 align:middle line:84%
and in order to move
further, in order

00:09:12.200 --> 00:09:15.890 align:middle line:84%
to unify the theories of quantum
physics and classical physics,

00:09:15.890 --> 00:09:21.080 align:middle line:84%
for example, in order to explain
the phenomena that are being

00:09:21.080 --> 00:09:23.390 align:middle line:84%
seen on the quantum
level, in order

00:09:23.390 --> 00:09:25.190 align:middle line:84%
to explain the
phenomenon that we're

00:09:25.190 --> 00:09:27.770 align:middle line:84%
seeing on the other
side of the universe

00:09:27.770 --> 00:09:30.470 align:middle line:84%
relative to where
we are now, science

00:09:30.470 --> 00:09:33.800 align:middle line:90%
must accept a deeper connection.

00:09:33.800 --> 00:09:37.670 align:middle line:90%
And it's for that reason, 1986.

00:09:37.670 --> 00:09:41.990 align:middle line:84%
1986, the Michelson-Morley
experiment was repeated.

00:09:41.990 --> 00:09:45.110 align:middle line:84%
It was repeated under the
auspices of the United States

00:09:45.110 --> 00:09:46.010 align:middle line:90%
Air Force.

00:09:46.010 --> 00:09:49.400 align:middle line:84%
Same experiment, they have
much better equipment.

00:09:49.400 --> 00:09:51.890 align:middle line:84%
And you'll never
guess what they found?

00:09:51.890 --> 00:09:53.840 align:middle line:90%
The field exists.

00:09:53.840 --> 00:09:59.150 align:middle line:84%
The 1986 experiment
demonstrated that the field

00:09:59.150 --> 00:10:02.120 align:middle line:84%
that can no longer be
called the ether, it exists.

00:10:02.120 --> 00:10:04.730 align:middle line:84%
And it exists precisely
within the parameters

00:10:04.730 --> 00:10:08.930 align:middle line:84%
that Michelson and Morley had
predicted 99 years earlier.

00:10:08.930 --> 00:10:11.240 align:middle line:84%
But this experiment,
in my opinion,

00:10:11.240 --> 00:10:14.210 align:middle line:84%
should have made the
headlines in major newspapers

00:10:14.210 --> 00:10:16.490 align:middle line:84%
and scientific journals
throughout the world.

00:10:16.490 --> 00:10:21.050 align:middle line:84%
Instead, it was relegated to a
relatively small article, again

00:10:21.050 --> 00:10:23.660 align:middle line:84%
in a very prestigious
journal, Nature.

00:10:23.660 --> 00:10:26.270 align:middle line:84%
It was performed by a
man named Silvertooth

00:10:26.270 --> 00:10:29.510 align:middle line:84%
under a very, very
benign title, simply

00:10:29.510 --> 00:10:32.430 align:middle line:90%
called Special Relativity.

00:10:32.430 --> 00:10:37.430 align:middle line:10%
It was published in the
journal "Nature," Volume 322

00:10:37.430 --> 00:10:40.440 align:middle line:10%
in August of 1986.

00:10:40.440 --> 00:10:42.440 align:middle line:84%
So if you'd like to check
this out for yourself,

00:10:42.440 --> 00:10:44.180 align:middle line:84%
you can go and see
what the article says.

00:10:44.180 --> 00:10:44.980 align:middle line:90%


00:10:44.980 --> 00:10:47.990 align:middle line:84%
What happened was when
Silvertooth replicated

00:10:47.990 --> 00:10:51.410 align:middle line:84%
the Michelson-Morley experiment,
he found that interference

00:10:51.410 --> 00:10:52.370 align:middle line:90%
pattern.

00:10:52.370 --> 00:10:54.770 align:middle line:10%
And what you're seeing
on your screen right now

00:10:54.770 --> 00:10:58.070 align:middle line:10%
is an image showing the light
without the interference

00:10:58.070 --> 00:11:00.290 align:middle line:10%
pattern on the left, and
with the interference

00:11:00.290 --> 00:11:01.310 align:middle line:10%
pattern on the right.

00:11:01.310 --> 00:11:04.160 align:middle line:10%
So you can actually see what
this interference pattern

00:11:04.160 --> 00:11:05.660 align:middle line:10%
is all about.

00:11:05.660 --> 00:11:08.780 align:middle line:84%
So version two of
Michelson and Morley

00:11:08.780 --> 00:11:13.140 align:middle line:84%
provided the first scientific
evidence for this field.

00:11:13.140 --> 00:11:15.290 align:middle line:84%
But it's also raised
a lot of questions.

00:11:15.290 --> 00:11:16.790 align:middle line:90%
New questions.

00:11:16.790 --> 00:11:19.190 align:middle line:84%
Now that we know this
field is out there,

00:11:19.190 --> 00:11:22.490 align:middle line:84%
scientists can stop asking
themselves, is it there

00:11:22.490 --> 00:11:24.840 align:middle line:84%
and begin answering
the deeper questions.

00:11:24.840 --> 00:11:26.120 align:middle line:90%
What does it made of?

00:11:26.120 --> 00:11:27.440 align:middle line:90%
How does it work?

00:11:27.440 --> 00:11:28.920 align:middle line:90%
How do we relate to this field?

00:11:28.920 --> 00:11:31.760 align:middle line:10%
What does it mean in
our everyday lives?

00:11:31.760 --> 00:11:34.880 align:middle line:10%
Well, the attempt to
answer these questions

00:11:34.880 --> 00:11:39.410 align:middle line:10%
has led to the largest
research project ever conceived

00:11:39.410 --> 00:11:42.660 align:middle line:10%
in 5,000 years of human history.

00:11:42.660 --> 00:11:46.430 align:middle line:10%
It has led to the greatest
level of scientific cooperation,

00:11:46.430 --> 00:11:49.250 align:middle line:10%
global cooperation,
using the largest

00:11:49.250 --> 00:11:54.440 align:middle line:10%
and the single most complex and
sophisticated device ever built

00:11:54.440 --> 00:11:56.190 align:middle line:10%
by humankind.

00:11:56.190 --> 00:11:58.340 align:middle line:84%
Of course, I'm talking
about the CERN,

00:11:58.340 --> 00:12:01.025 align:middle line:90%
superconducting super collider.

00:12:01.025 --> 00:12:02.690 align:middle line:84%
CERN is the European
Organization

00:12:02.690 --> 00:12:04.520 align:middle line:90%
for Nuclear Research.

00:12:04.520 --> 00:12:06.200 align:middle line:84%
And I know there's
a lot of information

00:12:06.200 --> 00:12:08.750 align:middle line:84%
out there in different
circles about CERN, what

00:12:08.750 --> 00:12:12.452 align:middle line:84%
it is, what it does, what
it means, who's using it.

00:12:12.452 --> 00:12:14.660 align:middle line:84%
I'd just like to address
briefly some of those things

00:12:14.660 --> 00:12:19.070 align:middle line:84%
and share with you how
these CERN experiments work

00:12:19.070 --> 00:12:21.350 align:middle line:84%
and what they have
recently discovered

00:12:21.350 --> 00:12:24.650 align:middle line:84%
with regard to the field
that we're now talking about.

00:12:24.650 --> 00:12:26.840 align:middle line:10%
So let's begin
with what is CERN.

00:12:26.840 --> 00:12:31.160 align:middle line:84%
It is the world's largest
superconducting super collider.

00:12:31.160 --> 00:12:34.010 align:middle line:10%
It is the largest
co-operative science project

00:12:34.010 --> 00:12:36.470 align:middle line:10%
the world has ever known.

00:12:36.470 --> 00:12:42.030 align:middle line:84%
It uses the largest and most
complex devices ever built.

00:12:42.030 --> 00:12:45.560 align:middle line:84%
It began in 1953,
and it's currently

00:12:45.560 --> 00:12:50.150 align:middle line:84%
maintained today by 22 nations
maintain the CERN laboratory

00:12:50.150 --> 00:12:51.350 align:middle line:90%
itself.

00:12:51.350 --> 00:12:55.280 align:middle line:10%
It hosts research from
over 12,000 scientists

00:12:55.280 --> 00:12:59.290 align:middle line:10%
from 600 universities that
represent over 70 countries.

00:12:59.290 --> 00:13:01.470 align:middle line:84%
And I want to be really
clear about this.

00:13:01.470 --> 00:13:04.940 align:middle line:84%
The research is for
university-backed projects

00:13:04.940 --> 00:13:05.900 align:middle line:90%
only.

00:13:05.900 --> 00:13:07.460 align:middle line:84%
So I'm saying that
because I've had

00:13:07.460 --> 00:13:11.480 align:middle line:84%
people ask me can any scientist
working from his basement

00:13:11.480 --> 00:13:13.640 align:middle line:84%
go over to CERN and
do an experiment

00:13:13.640 --> 00:13:16.670 align:middle line:84%
that has dangerous
implications for the world?

00:13:16.670 --> 00:13:17.870 align:middle line:90%
And the answer is no.

00:13:17.870 --> 00:13:19.810 align:middle line:84%
These are
university-backed projects.

00:13:19.810 --> 00:13:21.470 align:middle line:10%
So the point that
I'm making here

00:13:21.470 --> 00:13:24.620 align:middle line:10%
is CERN itself does
not do experiments.

00:13:24.620 --> 00:13:28.310 align:middle line:84%
CERN maintains the
laboratories that

00:13:28.310 --> 00:13:32.960 align:middle line:84%
are then made available to
universities and research

00:13:32.960 --> 00:13:38.090 align:middle line:84%
institutions under the
auspices of the universities

00:13:38.090 --> 00:13:41.750 align:middle line:84%
so that those
experiments can be done.

00:13:41.750 --> 00:13:44.130 align:middle line:84%
So what is the fundamental
purpose of CERN?

00:13:44.130 --> 00:13:47.220 align:middle line:10%
The purpose is to solve
the fundamental mysteries

00:13:47.220 --> 00:13:49.590 align:middle line:10%
of the universe,
and in doing so,

00:13:49.590 --> 00:13:52.050 align:middle line:10%
answer the deep questions
such as what is it

00:13:52.050 --> 00:13:54.030 align:middle line:10%
that fills the empty space?

00:13:54.030 --> 00:13:57.450 align:middle line:84%
CERN is trying to
determine what happened

00:13:57.450 --> 00:14:01.260 align:middle line:84%
in the first fractions of
fractions of seconds right

00:14:01.260 --> 00:14:04.140 align:middle line:84%
after the Big Bang, after
the instant of creation,

00:14:04.140 --> 00:14:07.290 align:middle line:84%
to determine what is
matter actually made of?

00:14:07.290 --> 00:14:10.920 align:middle line:84%
What is the field that
we're talking about made of?

00:14:10.920 --> 00:14:15.734 align:middle line:10%
I had the opportunity to
visit CERN myself in 2017.

00:14:15.734 --> 00:14:18.150 align:middle line:84%
And I want to share with you
a little bit of my experience

00:14:18.150 --> 00:14:20.170 align:middle line:90%
and what I discovered.

00:14:20.170 --> 00:14:23.080 align:middle line:90%
It is an amazing place.

00:14:23.080 --> 00:14:25.560 align:middle line:10%
And I think that we are not
really hearing about some

00:14:25.560 --> 00:14:28.020 align:middle line:10%
of the very, very
powerful discoveries that

00:14:28.020 --> 00:14:30.480 align:middle line:10%
are being made there and
what they really mean to us.

00:14:30.480 --> 00:14:32.670 align:middle line:10%
So let me just describe
the laboratory itself.

00:14:32.670 --> 00:14:36.000 align:middle line:84%
The laboratory is actually
made of multiple laboratories.

00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:39.120 align:middle line:84%
It is made of six particle
accelerators, one particle

00:14:39.120 --> 00:14:40.710 align:middle line:90%
decelerator.

00:14:40.710 --> 00:14:44.760 align:middle line:84%
So six laboratories where
they are accelerating quantum

00:14:44.760 --> 00:14:46.680 align:middle line:84%
particles at very
high rates of speed,

00:14:46.680 --> 00:14:48.790 align:middle line:90%
and one where they slow it down.

00:14:48.790 --> 00:14:49.590 align:middle line:90%
All right?

00:14:49.590 --> 00:14:52.200 align:middle line:10%
It's actually so
big, the laboratory

00:14:52.200 --> 00:14:55.770 align:middle line:10%
is so big that it overlaps
two to different countries.

00:14:55.770 --> 00:14:59.190 align:middle line:10%
It overlaps France
and Switzerland.

00:14:59.190 --> 00:15:00.810 align:middle line:10%
So when I was
visiting, we actually

00:15:00.810 --> 00:15:03.930 align:middle line:10%
had to cross an international
border to get from a laboratory

00:15:03.930 --> 00:15:07.650 align:middle line:10%
to the cafeteria, for example,
or from the library to where

00:15:07.650 --> 00:15:09.780 align:middle line:10%
some of the experiments are.

00:15:09.780 --> 00:15:14.400 align:middle line:10%
The device itself,
the devices, they

00:15:14.400 --> 00:15:19.260 align:middle line:10%
are located about 150 meters
under the surface of the Earth.

00:15:19.260 --> 00:15:20.880 align:middle line:10%
And what you're
seeing on your screen

00:15:20.880 --> 00:15:24.900 align:middle line:10%
is a schematic diagram of
how these laboratories work.

00:15:24.900 --> 00:15:26.820 align:middle line:10%
What you're seeing
are the circles,

00:15:26.820 --> 00:15:31.020 align:middle line:10%
these are the accelerators where
particles are accelerated just

00:15:31.020 --> 00:15:32.760 align:middle line:10%
under the speed
of light and then

00:15:32.760 --> 00:15:36.520 align:middle line:10%
allowed to collide in
very specific locations

00:15:36.520 --> 00:15:38.970 align:middle line:10%
so those collisions
can be monitored.

00:15:38.970 --> 00:15:41.760 align:middle line:10%
But before the particles
can reach those speeds,

00:15:41.760 --> 00:15:44.250 align:middle line:10%
they go through other
particle accelerators.

00:15:44.250 --> 00:15:46.050 align:middle line:10%
So you're seeing in
the bottom your screen,

00:15:46.050 --> 00:15:48.600 align:middle line:10%
there's a red oval, and
there's a smaller red oval.

00:15:48.600 --> 00:15:52.290 align:middle line:10%
And there are blue
lines, then, that

00:15:52.290 --> 00:15:55.770 align:middle line:10%
represent where these
particles are being directed

00:15:55.770 --> 00:15:59.220 align:middle line:10%
from the smaller ovals,
where the particles are being

00:15:59.220 --> 00:16:02.370 align:middle line:10%
prepared for the
experiment and accelerated

00:16:02.370 --> 00:16:03.540 align:middle line:10%
to certain rates of speed.

00:16:03.540 --> 00:16:05.370 align:middle line:10%
And they follow
the blue lines up

00:16:05.370 --> 00:16:09.060 align:middle line:10%
into the larger and the larger,
the larger accelerators where

00:16:09.060 --> 00:16:10.890 align:middle line:10%
you see those larger circles.

00:16:10.890 --> 00:16:13.920 align:middle line:84%
So bottom line of
what's happening here

00:16:13.920 --> 00:16:19.470 align:middle line:84%
is that inside of the
particle accelerators,

00:16:19.470 --> 00:16:21.240 align:middle line:90%
there are two tubes.

00:16:21.240 --> 00:16:26.720 align:middle line:84%
And in one tube, quantum
particles, generally protons,

00:16:26.720 --> 00:16:30.440 align:middle line:84%
are accelerated in one
direction until they reach just

00:16:30.440 --> 00:16:32.270 align:middle line:90%
under the speed of light.

00:16:32.270 --> 00:16:37.100 align:middle line:84%
And in the second tube,
another set of particles

00:16:37.100 --> 00:16:40.760 align:middle line:84%
are being accelerated in
the opposite direction

00:16:40.760 --> 00:16:43.860 align:middle line:84%
until they reach just
under the speed of light.

00:16:43.860 --> 00:16:47.060 align:middle line:84%
And there is a very
specific point, then,

00:16:47.060 --> 00:16:49.670 align:middle line:84%
where these particles
are allowed,

00:16:49.670 --> 00:16:52.790 align:middle line:84%
they're directed to come
together and collide

00:16:52.790 --> 00:16:53.790 align:middle line:90%
with one another.

00:16:53.790 --> 00:16:56.730 align:middle line:84%
This is the particle collision
that we're talking about.

00:16:56.730 --> 00:17:01.160 align:middle line:84%
And when that happens,
the quantum particles

00:17:01.160 --> 00:17:05.700 align:middle line:84%
are destroyed in
and of themselves

00:17:05.700 --> 00:17:09.900 align:middle line:84%
and broken into fragments
of their constituents.

00:17:09.900 --> 00:17:12.960 align:middle line:10%
And these fragments,
these smaller particles

00:17:12.960 --> 00:17:17.970 align:middle line:10%
create very specific traces,
very specific patterns that

00:17:17.970 --> 00:17:19.140 align:middle line:10%
can be mapped.

00:17:19.140 --> 00:17:23.160 align:middle line:10%
And they have characteristic
qualities that scientists know.

00:17:23.160 --> 00:17:25.589 align:middle line:10%
So what you're seeing
on the screen right now

00:17:25.589 --> 00:17:30.150 align:middle line:10%
is a typical map from
the resulting collision

00:17:30.150 --> 00:17:32.090 align:middle line:10%
of quantum particles.

00:17:32.090 --> 00:17:34.290 align:middle line:10%
And each of those
paths that you see

00:17:34.290 --> 00:17:37.140 align:middle line:10%
is tracing a path,
and the quality

00:17:37.140 --> 00:17:41.190 align:middle line:10%
and the characteristic of
an even smaller constituent

00:17:41.190 --> 00:17:42.460 align:middle line:10%
of the particles.

00:17:42.460 --> 00:17:44.790 align:middle line:10%
So in this way,
these scientists are

00:17:44.790 --> 00:17:50.640 align:middle line:10%
beginning to understand the
elementary particles, the stuff

00:17:50.640 --> 00:17:53.370 align:middle line:10%
that goes into making up
the matter as we know it

00:17:53.370 --> 00:17:55.520 align:middle line:10%
in the world today.

00:17:55.520 --> 00:17:57.270 align:middle line:84%
I've spent a lot of
my adult life studying

00:17:57.270 --> 00:17:59.700 align:middle line:84%
ancient and
indigenous traditions.

00:17:59.700 --> 00:18:02.070 align:middle line:84%
And although, as I've said,
they're not always science,

00:18:02.070 --> 00:18:04.590 align:middle line:84%
a lot of those traditions
give us tremendous insight

00:18:04.590 --> 00:18:07.890 align:middle line:84%
into what science is
revealing in our world today.

00:18:07.890 --> 00:18:12.720 align:middle line:84%
In the Hindu traditions, for
example, the creation deity--

00:18:12.720 --> 00:18:16.410 align:middle line:84%
actually, three deities,
Brahma, the creator, Vishnu,

00:18:16.410 --> 00:18:19.160 align:middle line:90%
the maintainer, and Shiva.

00:18:19.160 --> 00:18:22.920 align:middle line:84%
And Shiva is typically
described as the destroyer,

00:18:22.920 --> 00:18:26.490 align:middle line:84%
although if you go into the
Hindu traditions themselves,

00:18:26.490 --> 00:18:29.180 align:middle line:84%
Shiva is not so much
about the destroyer.

00:18:29.180 --> 00:18:32.880 align:middle line:84%
Shiva is the transformer
or the regenerator,

00:18:32.880 --> 00:18:34.890 align:middle line:84%
so the particle
must be destroyed

00:18:34.890 --> 00:18:39.820 align:middle line:84%
before it can be transformed or
regenerated into something new.

00:18:39.820 --> 00:18:41.850 align:middle line:84%
So it's not the
destruction in the sense

00:18:41.850 --> 00:18:44.340 align:middle line:90%
that everything is just gone.

00:18:44.340 --> 00:18:46.710 align:middle line:84%
What was once
present is destroyed

00:18:46.710 --> 00:18:48.780 align:middle line:90%
to reveal something deeper.

00:18:48.780 --> 00:18:52.710 align:middle line:10%
I'm sharing this with you
because at the CERN facility,

00:18:52.710 --> 00:18:55.890 align:middle line:10%
the country of India donated
the image you're seeing

00:18:55.890 --> 00:18:57.700 align:middle line:10%
on your screen right now.

00:18:57.700 --> 00:19:01.680 align:middle line:10%
This is the image of Shiva, the
transformer, the regenerator,

00:19:01.680 --> 00:19:05.550 align:middle line:10%
to symbolize what it is
that's happening at the CERN

00:19:05.550 --> 00:19:08.930 align:middle line:10%
superconducting super
colliding laboratories.

00:19:08.930 --> 00:19:11.550 align:middle line:84%
And I think this is
fascinating that we see this.

00:19:11.550 --> 00:19:13.440 align:middle line:84%
So the question,
what is it that's

00:19:13.440 --> 00:19:16.290 align:middle line:84%
actually being transformed,
as Shiva is saying,

00:19:16.290 --> 00:19:18.180 align:middle line:90%
or regenerated?

00:19:18.180 --> 00:19:20.250 align:middle line:84%
Well, I'm going to
talk about the field.

00:19:20.250 --> 00:19:22.290 align:middle line:84%
Before I do that,
we're going to talk

00:19:22.290 --> 00:19:25.470 align:middle line:84%
just a little bit about
some really basic physics

00:19:25.470 --> 00:19:29.250 align:middle line:84%
and where we are in
the world right now.

00:19:29.250 --> 00:19:34.230 align:middle line:84%
When I was in school back in
the 1950s, 1960s, early '70s,

00:19:34.230 --> 00:19:37.320 align:middle line:84%
I was taught that the atom
looks like what you're

00:19:37.320 --> 00:19:38.820 align:middle line:90%
seeing on the screen right now.

00:19:38.820 --> 00:19:41.700 align:middle line:84%
And it was things
moving around the thing,

00:19:41.700 --> 00:19:47.140 align:middle line:84%
particles called electrons that
are moving around the nucleus.

00:19:47.140 --> 00:19:51.180 align:middle line:84%
And this is the model that
has gotten science so far.

00:19:51.180 --> 00:19:52.725 align:middle line:84%
However, it is
also the model that

00:19:52.725 --> 00:19:55.450 align:middle line:84%
is breaking down because we
now know that the atom doesn't

00:19:55.450 --> 00:19:56.250 align:middle line:90%
look like this.

00:19:56.250 --> 00:20:01.230 align:middle line:84%
The atom is not things
moving around things.

00:20:01.230 --> 00:20:04.740 align:middle line:10%
And this model of the electron,
the proton, and the neutron,

00:20:04.740 --> 00:20:07.560 align:middle line:10%
as well as it served
us, technically

00:20:07.560 --> 00:20:09.640 align:middle line:10%
we know it is no longer true.

00:20:09.640 --> 00:20:14.760 align:middle line:10%
The atom is made of fields
of energy, pulsing, vibrating

00:20:14.760 --> 00:20:18.390 align:middle line:10%
fields of energy that are
concentrated in some places

00:20:18.390 --> 00:20:19.990 align:middle line:10%
more than others.

00:20:19.990 --> 00:20:24.060 align:middle line:10%
But this new model, this
vibratory model of the atom,

00:20:24.060 --> 00:20:29.350 align:middle line:10%
has given way to the
particles and the subparticles

00:20:29.350 --> 00:20:32.580 align:middle line:10%
now that are so complex and
so numerous they're actually

00:20:32.580 --> 00:20:34.800 align:middle line:10%
called the particle zoo.

00:20:34.800 --> 00:20:37.230 align:middle line:10%
Remember, when you and I
were in school, probably

00:20:37.230 --> 00:20:39.780 align:middle line:10%
we thought that
physics was complex

00:20:39.780 --> 00:20:43.140 align:middle line:10%
when we talked about the atom
being electrons, protons,

00:20:43.140 --> 00:20:45.820 align:middle line:10%
neutrons, and all the
things that go with that.

00:20:45.820 --> 00:20:49.170 align:middle line:10%
Well, the particle zoo now
has gone far beyond electrons,

00:20:49.170 --> 00:20:50.940 align:middle line:10%
protons, and neutrons.

00:20:50.940 --> 00:20:54.600 align:middle line:84%
They're telling us now
the new standard model,

00:20:54.600 --> 00:20:58.790 align:middle line:84%
that all matter is made
of leptons, bosons,

00:20:58.790 --> 00:21:00.840 align:middle line:90%
and what are called hadrons.

00:21:00.840 --> 00:21:02.760 align:middle line:84%
Under the category
of leptons, this

00:21:02.760 --> 00:21:05.490 align:middle line:84%
is where we find our
familiar electron as well

00:21:05.490 --> 00:21:07.440 align:middle line:90%
as other particles.

00:21:07.440 --> 00:21:12.510 align:middle line:84%
Under the category of bosons
is where we now find photons.

00:21:12.510 --> 00:21:14.220 align:middle line:10%
And under the
category of hadrons

00:21:14.220 --> 00:21:17.550 align:middle line:10%
is where we now find things like
the protons and the neutrons,

00:21:17.550 --> 00:21:20.080 align:middle line:10%
as well as quarks and
a lot of other things.

00:21:20.080 --> 00:21:22.530 align:middle line:10%
This is a very, very
different physics

00:21:22.530 --> 00:21:26.250 align:middle line:10%
that has unfolded as a result
of what has been discovered

00:21:26.250 --> 00:21:29.160 align:middle line:10%
at CERN and other
laboratories as we

00:21:29.160 --> 00:21:30.820 align:middle line:10%
look into these
fundamental particles.

00:21:30.820 --> 00:21:33.870 align:middle line:84%
Now all this is going
somewhere because everything

00:21:33.870 --> 00:21:35.790 align:middle line:84%
that we're learning
about this physics

00:21:35.790 --> 00:21:40.290 align:middle line:84%
must be occurring within
the conduit of stuff.

00:21:40.290 --> 00:21:43.200 align:middle line:84%
There's something out
there that is allowing

00:21:43.200 --> 00:21:44.790 align:middle line:84%
all these interactions
to happen,

00:21:44.790 --> 00:21:47.280 align:middle line:84%
and this is where we're
going with this whole thing

00:21:47.280 --> 00:21:48.460 align:middle line:90%
right now.

00:21:48.460 --> 00:21:51.720 align:middle line:10%
So when we look at what is
now called the standard model

00:21:51.720 --> 00:21:54.030 align:middle line:10%
of physics--you're seeing
it on your screen--

00:21:54.030 --> 00:21:56.850 align:middle line:10%
what you see is that there are
some particles that are related

00:21:56.850 --> 00:22:00.450 align:middle line:10%
to matter, some particles
are related to force,

00:22:00.450 --> 00:22:04.170 align:middle line:10%
and some are theoretical,
such as the Higgs particle.

00:22:04.170 --> 00:22:06.050 align:middle line:10%
And you're seeing
it in a gray box.

00:22:06.050 --> 00:22:07.860 align:middle line:10%
It's got a circle around it.

00:22:07.860 --> 00:22:10.950 align:middle line:10%
The Higgs particle-- if the
standard model is accurate,

00:22:10.950 --> 00:22:13.590 align:middle line:10%
if it works the way we
think it really works--

00:22:13.590 --> 00:22:16.950 align:middle line:10%
then we should be able to
find, under certain conditions,

00:22:16.950 --> 00:22:19.360 align:middle line:10%
this Higgs particle.

00:22:19.360 --> 00:22:21.390 align:middle line:84%
And if that particle
is there, it's

00:22:21.390 --> 00:22:23.640 align:middle line:84%
going to open the door
to even deeper questions,

00:22:23.640 --> 00:22:27.060 align:middle line:84%
but it's going to give us a lot
of answers at the same time.

00:22:27.060 --> 00:22:29.640 align:middle line:84%
The question that the
physicists are asking,

00:22:29.640 --> 00:22:32.050 align:middle line:90%
is there an ultimate particle?

00:22:32.050 --> 00:22:35.520 align:middle line:84%
And we've gone from the atom,
as we used to think of it, now

00:22:35.520 --> 00:22:37.140 align:middle line:90%
to this particle zoo.

00:22:37.140 --> 00:22:38.880 align:middle line:90%
Is there an ultimate particle?

00:22:38.880 --> 00:22:41.340 align:middle line:84%
Is there what is
called a god particle?

00:22:41.340 --> 00:22:43.890 align:middle line:84%
This is the term some physicists
are actually using now.

00:22:43.890 --> 00:22:47.280 align:middle line:84%
Is there a god particle that
is the fundamental particle

00:22:47.280 --> 00:22:48.860 align:middle line:90%
for all things?

00:22:48.860 --> 00:22:50.910 align:middle line:84%
Well, I'm going to
come back to CERN now.

00:22:50.910 --> 00:22:55.932 align:middle line:84%
CERN is recreating the Big
Bang to answer this question.

00:22:55.932 --> 00:22:57.390 align:middle line:84%
It's not so much
about the Big Bang

00:22:57.390 --> 00:22:59.550 align:middle line:84%
itself, that primal
release of energy.

00:22:59.550 --> 00:23:03.540 align:middle line:84%
It's what happened just
fractions of fractions

00:23:03.540 --> 00:23:08.130 align:middle line:84%
of fractions of a second
after that release happened.

00:23:08.130 --> 00:23:13.050 align:middle line:84%
As the universe began to expand,
something began to change.

00:23:13.050 --> 00:23:17.100 align:middle line:84%
And certain particles that were
created in that release did

00:23:17.100 --> 00:23:19.200 align:middle line:84%
things that cannot be
accounted for right now.

00:23:19.200 --> 00:23:21.900 align:middle line:84%
Some of the particles
slowed down.

00:23:21.900 --> 00:23:25.070 align:middle line:84%
Some of them continued
moving at the same speed.

00:23:25.070 --> 00:23:27.060 align:middle line:90%
And scientists are saying why?

00:23:27.060 --> 00:23:30.390 align:middle line:84%
Why would some particles
slow and some particles

00:23:30.390 --> 00:23:31.710 align:middle line:90%
continue at the same speed?

00:23:31.710 --> 00:23:33.600 align:middle line:84%
Why would some
particles begin to have

00:23:33.600 --> 00:23:36.540 align:middle line:84%
mass and other
particles not have mass?

00:23:36.540 --> 00:23:39.460 align:middle line:84%
Well the current theory
is this, that there

00:23:39.460 --> 00:23:42.300 align:middle line:84%
is an unrecognized
field of energy that was

00:23:42.300 --> 00:23:44.760 align:middle line:90%
responsible for those changes.

00:23:44.760 --> 00:23:48.930 align:middle line:84%
And that field has been known
as the Higgs field in honor

00:23:48.930 --> 00:23:52.710 align:middle line:84%
of the creator of the theory is
a physicist named Peter Higgs,

00:23:52.710 --> 00:23:54.840 align:middle line:90%
who's still with us today.

00:23:54.840 --> 00:24:00.090 align:middle line:84%
On July 4 of the year
2012, scientists at CERN

00:24:00.090 --> 00:24:03.450 align:middle line:84%
made an announcement
that absolutely rocked

00:24:03.450 --> 00:24:05.280 align:middle line:90%
the scientific community.

00:24:05.280 --> 00:24:09.180 align:middle line:84%
They announced that through
one of the CERN experiments,

00:24:09.180 --> 00:24:11.670 align:middle line:84%
they had discovered
a new particle,

00:24:11.670 --> 00:24:16.050 align:middle line:84%
and it was in the mass
region precisely where

00:24:16.050 --> 00:24:18.030 align:middle line:84%
that Higgs particle
was predicted

00:24:18.030 --> 00:24:19.820 align:middle line:90%
to be by the standard model.

00:24:19.820 --> 00:24:21.480 align:middle line:90%
They'd never seen it before.

00:24:21.480 --> 00:24:24.090 align:middle line:10%
So they said if the
standard model is working,

00:24:24.090 --> 00:24:26.010 align:middle line:10%
and we collide these
particles, and they

00:24:26.010 --> 00:24:30.360 align:middle line:10%
break down into their
elementary constituent particles

00:24:30.360 --> 00:24:35.040 align:middle line:10%
in the area of a certain energy
level, we should see something.

00:24:35.040 --> 00:24:40.050 align:middle line:10%
That energy level is
126 giga electron volts.

00:24:40.050 --> 00:24:41.820 align:middle line:10%
They'd never looked
there before.

00:24:41.820 --> 00:24:44.950 align:middle line:10%
And when they made this
discovery, lo and behold,

00:24:44.950 --> 00:24:48.270 align:middle line:10%
there was a particle with
precisely those characteristics

00:24:48.270 --> 00:24:50.550 align:middle line:10%
precisely where they
predicted it was.

00:24:50.550 --> 00:24:55.720 align:middle line:10%
It is now called the Higgs
Boson, the Higgs particle.

00:24:55.720 --> 00:24:59.040 align:middle line:10%
So the properties
of this Higgs Boson

00:24:59.040 --> 00:25:01.170 align:middle line:10%
are precisely
consistent from where

00:25:01.170 --> 00:25:03.240 align:middle line:10%
Peter Higgs had predicted.

00:25:03.240 --> 00:25:05.670 align:middle line:84%
Well, this is
important, and this

00:25:05.670 --> 00:25:08.340 align:middle line:84%
is where it gets really,
really interesting

00:25:08.340 --> 00:25:12.010 align:middle line:84%
because for the
Higgs Boson to exist,

00:25:12.010 --> 00:25:17.280 align:middle line:84%
there must be a Higgs field
that it is emerging from.

00:25:17.280 --> 00:25:20.550 align:middle line:84%
The Higgs field is
the elusive field

00:25:20.550 --> 00:25:23.760 align:middle line:84%
that we're going to be talking
about throughout this program.

00:25:23.760 --> 00:25:27.710 align:middle line:84%
The Higgs field has
now been validated.

00:25:27.710 --> 00:25:30.630 align:middle line:84%
The Higgs field is believed to
be the field that scientists

00:25:30.630 --> 00:25:32.790 align:middle line:84%
have been searching
for three centuries

00:25:32.790 --> 00:25:35.760 align:middle line:84%
now, since the time of
Isaac Newton, the ether that

00:25:35.760 --> 00:25:37.470 align:middle line:90%
fills the empty space.

00:25:37.470 --> 00:25:41.280 align:middle line:84%
It's now accepted that this
Higgs field is the field that

00:25:41.280 --> 00:25:43.590 align:middle line:90%
exists everywhere all the time.

00:25:43.590 --> 00:25:46.770 align:middle line:84%
It's what gives
particles their mass.

00:25:46.770 --> 00:25:52.170 align:middle line:84%
So at the time of the Big Bang,
just after that primal release

00:25:52.170 --> 00:25:55.140 align:middle line:84%
of energy when those
particles were created

00:25:55.140 --> 00:25:59.550 align:middle line:84%
and they began to
expand, it is moving

00:25:59.550 --> 00:26:02.580 align:middle line:84%
because they're moving
through the Higgs field,

00:26:02.580 --> 00:26:05.460 align:middle line:84%
that some of the particles
interacted with the field

00:26:05.460 --> 00:26:08.010 align:middle line:84%
in a way that slowed them
down and gave them mass

00:26:08.010 --> 00:26:10.320 align:middle line:84%
while others continued
to move at the speed

00:26:10.320 --> 00:26:13.920 align:middle line:90%
that they were originally.

00:26:13.920 --> 00:26:18.040 align:middle line:84%
In the scientific world, this
is a blockbuster discovery.

00:26:18.040 --> 00:26:22.140 align:middle line:84%
This is a landmark discovery
because this field that

00:26:22.140 --> 00:26:24.780 align:middle line:84%
has been questioned,
the speculation has

00:26:24.780 --> 00:26:28.470 align:middle line:84%
been does it exist, is it
there, we now know that it is.

00:26:28.470 --> 00:26:29.590 align:middle line:90%
And it's given many names.

00:26:29.590 --> 00:26:31.870 align:middle line:84%
Some people simply call
this the Higgs field.

00:26:31.870 --> 00:26:33.810 align:middle line:90%
Some people call it the field.

00:26:33.810 --> 00:26:35.250 align:middle line:90%
Some are calling it the source.

00:26:35.250 --> 00:26:37.320 align:middle line:84%
Some are calling it the
matrix, as Max Planck.

00:26:37.320 --> 00:26:39.940 align:middle line:84%
Some are calling this
the divine matrix.

00:26:39.940 --> 00:26:41.940 align:middle line:10%
And for the rest
of this program,

00:26:41.940 --> 00:26:44.220 align:middle line:10%
just to make it easy
for our conversation,

00:26:44.220 --> 00:26:46.710 align:middle line:10%
I'm going to use either
the term the matrix

00:26:46.710 --> 00:26:50.280 align:middle line:10%
or the divine matrix to
describe the field that we're

00:26:50.280 --> 00:26:51.120 align:middle line:10%
talking about now.

00:26:51.120 --> 00:26:54.120 align:middle line:10%
So the question is, now we
know that the field is there,

00:26:54.120 --> 00:26:57.220 align:middle line:10%
this matrix is there,
what does it do?

00:26:57.220 --> 00:26:59.380 align:middle line:10%
How does it work?

00:26:59.380 --> 00:27:02.850 align:middle line:84%
Well, this field fulfills
three fundamental principles

00:27:02.850 --> 00:27:05.629 align:middle line:84%
that make your life
possible, my life possible,

00:27:05.629 --> 00:27:07.170 align:middle line:84%
and the world as we
know it possible.

00:27:07.170 --> 00:27:11.280 align:middle line:84%
Number one, the field is the
container for all things.

00:27:11.280 --> 00:27:13.290 align:middle line:84%
All things that we
know, all things that

00:27:13.290 --> 00:27:16.650 align:middle line:84%
exist in the universe
are happening

00:27:16.650 --> 00:27:20.730 align:middle line:84%
within the confines of this
field of the Divine Matrix.

00:27:20.730 --> 00:27:24.660 align:middle line:84%
Number two, it is the
bridge between our inner

00:27:24.660 --> 00:27:25.590 align:middle line:90%
and our outer world.

00:27:25.590 --> 00:27:29.790 align:middle line:84%
It is the bridge that explains
how our thoughts, feelings,

00:27:29.790 --> 00:27:34.980 align:middle line:84%
emotions, our prayers can
be created from within us

00:27:34.980 --> 00:27:39.060 align:middle line:84%
but find the people
and the places

00:27:39.060 --> 00:27:41.220 align:middle line:84%
that are the object
of our prayers,

00:27:41.220 --> 00:27:43.420 align:middle line:84%
whether in another room or
halfway around the world.

00:27:43.420 --> 00:27:44.220 align:middle line:90%
That's the bridge.

00:27:44.220 --> 00:27:47.700 align:middle line:84%
And number three, this
field is the mirror.

00:27:47.700 --> 00:27:50.760 align:middle line:84%
It's a quantum
mirror in our world

00:27:50.760 --> 00:27:54.630 align:middle line:84%
for what we truly believe in
our mind and in our heart,

00:27:54.630 --> 00:27:59.080 align:middle line:84%
and what we create
in our imagination.

00:27:59.080 --> 00:28:02.640 align:middle line:84%
So when we ask the
question now, who are we,

00:28:02.640 --> 00:28:06.330 align:middle line:84%
our answer must incorporate
our relationship to this field,

00:28:06.330 --> 00:28:08.490 align:middle line:90%
to the divine matrix.

00:28:08.490 --> 00:28:11.280 align:middle line:10%
I've spent much of my
adult life exploring

00:28:11.280 --> 00:28:14.910 align:middle line:10%
many of the ancient indigenous
traditions of our past.

00:28:14.910 --> 00:28:17.100 align:middle line:10%
And my exploration
has taken me into some

00:28:17.100 --> 00:28:18.960 align:middle line:10%
of the most magnificent
and beautiful

00:28:18.960 --> 00:28:21.090 align:middle line:10%
and remote and
isolated and pristine

00:28:21.090 --> 00:28:24.360 align:middle line:10%
places remaining in the world
today, such as the monasteries

00:28:24.360 --> 00:28:28.140 align:middle line:10%
of Tibet that were very
available to me in the 1990s

00:28:28.140 --> 00:28:30.697 align:middle line:10%
as I was taking groups
into these places.

00:28:30.697 --> 00:28:32.280 align:middle line:84%
And it was in one
of these monasteries

00:28:32.280 --> 00:28:34.350 align:middle line:84%
that I had the
opportunity to meet

00:28:34.350 --> 00:28:36.870 align:middle line:84%
with the elder, the
abbot of the monastery.

00:28:36.870 --> 00:28:39.630 align:middle line:10%
And it was while I was writing
the book titled "The Divine

00:28:39.630 --> 00:28:40.950 align:middle line:10%
Matrix".

00:28:40.950 --> 00:28:45.810 align:middle line:10%
And I asked this abbot, from
his perspective as a Buddhist

00:28:45.810 --> 00:28:48.870 align:middle line:10%
scientist, as a Buddhist
scholar, I asked him,

00:28:48.870 --> 00:28:53.890 align:middle line:10%
what is the stuff that fills
the field of everything?

00:28:53.890 --> 00:28:56.850 align:middle line:84%
What is the stuff that holds
this universe together?

00:28:56.850 --> 00:29:00.450 align:middle line:84%
What is the force
that allows everything

00:29:00.450 --> 00:29:03.160 align:middle line:84%
to be as it is in
the world today?

00:29:03.160 --> 00:29:05.610 align:middle line:84%
Well, my Tibetan is terrible,
so I was speaking to him

00:29:05.610 --> 00:29:07.140 align:middle line:90%
through a translator.

00:29:07.140 --> 00:29:10.170 align:middle line:84%
And he and the translator
launched into a conversation

00:29:10.170 --> 00:29:13.320 align:middle line:84%
without me, back
and forth, bantering

00:29:13.320 --> 00:29:15.300 align:middle line:84%
because of the
uncertainty that he

00:29:15.300 --> 00:29:17.520 align:middle line:84%
had in terms of
my knowledge level

00:29:17.520 --> 00:29:19.530 align:middle line:84%
and how they answered
the question.

00:29:19.530 --> 00:29:22.170 align:middle line:84%
And suddenly the
translator looked at me

00:29:22.170 --> 00:29:25.140 align:middle line:84%
and answered my question
with a single word,

00:29:25.140 --> 00:29:28.290 align:middle line:90%
and the word was compassion.

00:29:28.290 --> 00:29:30.420 align:middle line:84%
So the answer to
my question, what

00:29:30.420 --> 00:29:32.640 align:middle line:84%
is the stuff that fills
the universe, what

00:29:32.640 --> 00:29:35.220 align:middle line:84%
is the stuff that holds
everything together,

00:29:35.220 --> 00:29:39.540 align:middle line:84%
the abbot had just answered
me with the word compassion.

00:29:39.540 --> 00:29:45.450 align:middle line:84%
And I looked back at him and
I said, is compassion a force

00:29:45.450 --> 00:29:46.492 align:middle line:90%
that fills the universe?

00:29:46.492 --> 00:29:48.450 align:middle line:84%
Is it the stuff that
holds everything together?

00:29:48.450 --> 00:29:52.080 align:middle line:84%
Or is compassion an experience
that we have within our bodies?

00:29:52.080 --> 00:29:54.120 align:middle line:84%
And once again, the
translator and the abbot

00:29:54.120 --> 00:29:56.610 align:middle line:84%
had their conversation
back and forth.

00:29:56.610 --> 00:29:59.620 align:middle line:84%
And then they looked at me with
a single word for the answer.

00:29:59.620 --> 00:30:02.700 align:middle line:84%
And the answer was simply
yes, that compassion

00:30:02.700 --> 00:30:05.460 align:middle line:84%
is both a force that
fills the universe

00:30:05.460 --> 00:30:09.150 align:middle line:84%
and holds this world together,
and it is an experience

00:30:09.150 --> 00:30:11.350 align:middle line:84%
that we create
within our bodies.

00:30:11.350 --> 00:30:14.550 align:middle line:84%
Now I'm sharing this with you
because on the cold, damp floor

00:30:14.550 --> 00:30:17.190 align:middle line:84%
of a monastery at almost
16,000 feet above sea

00:30:17.190 --> 00:30:21.690 align:middle line:84%
level on the Tibetan Plateau,
this beautiful, powerful,

00:30:21.690 --> 00:30:24.720 align:middle line:84%
brilliant Buddhist man had
just shared with me one

00:30:24.720 --> 00:30:28.020 align:middle line:84%
of the deepest secrets of the
human experience, that we have

00:30:28.020 --> 00:30:33.060 align:middle line:84%
within us the ability to
interact with the force that

00:30:33.060 --> 00:30:35.730 align:middle line:84%
fills the empty space
of the universe.

00:30:35.730 --> 00:30:38.460 align:middle line:84%
And that interaction
and that force

00:30:38.460 --> 00:30:43.240 align:middle line:84%
is the focus of their
lifetime of study.

00:30:43.240 --> 00:30:46.870 align:middle line:84%
So when I asked him about
the role of compassion

00:30:46.870 --> 00:30:50.020 align:middle line:84%
in our lives, what
he was saying to me

00:30:50.020 --> 00:30:55.090 align:middle line:84%
is that because this field
is a mirror for everything

00:30:55.090 --> 00:30:59.530 align:middle line:84%
that we create within us, we
create compassion in the world

00:30:59.530 --> 00:31:01.720 align:middle line:84%
by becoming compassion
in our lives.

00:31:01.720 --> 00:31:05.020 align:middle line:84%
The field is reflecting
what it is that we become.

00:31:05.020 --> 00:31:07.760 align:middle line:84%
In other words, we must
become in our lives

00:31:07.760 --> 00:31:09.760 align:middle line:84%
the things that we
choose to experience

00:31:09.760 --> 00:31:10.750 align:middle line:90%
in the world around us.

00:31:10.750 --> 00:31:14.670 align:middle line:90%


00:31:14.670 --> 00:31:17.930 align:middle line:84%
So the rules that
govern Planck's field

00:31:17.930 --> 00:31:22.130 align:middle line:84%
are the rules that govern the
Higgs field, the rules that

00:31:22.130 --> 00:31:25.310 align:middle line:84%
govern this field that the
abbot is describing for me.

00:31:25.310 --> 00:31:29.420 align:middle line:84%
Those rules tell us why the
abbot was absolutely correct

00:31:29.420 --> 00:31:33.180 align:middle line:84%
when he said to me that we
must become in our lives

00:31:33.180 --> 00:31:35.550 align:middle line:84%
the things that we choose
to experience in the world.

00:31:35.550 --> 00:31:39.160 align:middle line:90%


00:31:39.160 --> 00:31:41.050 align:middle line:84%
Both the discovery
of the Higgs field

00:31:41.050 --> 00:31:43.810 align:middle line:84%
and the wisdom of the
Tibetan abbot tell us

00:31:43.810 --> 00:31:47.050 align:middle line:84%
that not only are we connected
through a field of energy,

00:31:47.050 --> 00:31:49.160 align:middle line:90%
but we are the field.

00:31:49.160 --> 00:31:50.530 align:middle line:90%
We are the matrix.

00:31:50.530 --> 00:31:52.480 align:middle line:84%
And it's because
we're the matrix

00:31:52.480 --> 00:31:54.430 align:middle line:84%
that the discoveries
that describe it

00:31:54.430 --> 00:31:57.410 align:middle line:84%
are describing us as
well, our possibilities,

00:31:57.410 --> 00:32:00.040 align:middle line:90%
our capabilities, our potential.

00:32:00.040 --> 00:32:02.170 align:middle line:84%
Well, in the next
episode, we'll discover

00:32:02.170 --> 00:32:04.180 align:middle line:84%
the rules that define
the matrix that

00:32:04.180 --> 00:32:06.530 align:middle line:90%
underlies our everyday reality.

00:32:06.530 --> 00:32:08.630 align:middle line:84%
