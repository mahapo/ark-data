Hello.

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:42.417 align:middle line:10%
My name's Gregg
Braden, and I want

00:00:42.417 --> 00:00:44.990 align:middle line:10%
to welcome you to this very
special edition of "Missing

00:00:44.990 --> 00:00:46.100 align:middle line:10%
Links."

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:48.920 align:middle line:84%
Today I am with a dear
friend, a colleague who I've

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:50.880 align:middle line:90%
known for many, many years.

00:00:50.880 --> 00:00:53.360 align:middle line:84%
We have had the opportunity
to tour the world together,

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:55.610 align:middle line:84%
to share the new
discoveries based

00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:57.890 align:middle line:84%
on peer-reviewed science
that are overturning

00:00:57.890 --> 00:01:00.230 align:middle line:84%
150 years of scientific
thinking when

00:01:00.230 --> 00:01:02.180 align:middle line:84%
it comes to you and
me and the way we

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:05.120 align:middle line:84%
feel about ourselves, our
relationship to the world,

00:01:05.120 --> 00:01:06.380 align:middle line:90%
and beyond.

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:09.330 align:middle line:84%
Today we're going to be talking
about what those discoveries

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:10.130 align:middle line:90%
mean in our lives.

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:10.930 align:middle line:90%
Where do we go?

00:01:10.930 --> 00:01:12.405 align:middle line:84%
How do we apply
these discoveries?

00:01:12.405 --> 00:01:13.530 align:middle line:90%
Bruce, I want to thank you.

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:14.690 align:middle line:90%
Welcome to the program today.

>>BRUCE LIPTON: I am so happy
to be back with you, Gregg.

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:17.870 align:middle line:90%
Thank you so very much.

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:19.520 align:middle line:84%
>>GREGG: Well,
you're very welcome.

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:21.770 align:middle line:84%
You're always a welcome
guest in this series

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:23.810 align:middle line:84%
because you've got
so much to say.

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:26.290 align:middle line:84%
We've covered a lot of
ground through the work

00:01:26.290 --> 00:01:28.540 align:middle line:84%
that we've done together and
through these interviews.

00:01:28.540 --> 00:01:30.590 align:middle line:84%
And the new discoveries--
it's not like they

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:32.270 align:middle line:84%
happened at a fixed
moment in time.

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:33.140 align:middle line:90%
They are constant.

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:34.610 align:middle line:90%
They are ongoing.

The best science
of the modern world

00:01:36.110 --> 00:01:40.220 align:middle line:84%
continues to reveal the deepest
truths of our existence, that

00:01:40.220 --> 00:01:43.580 align:middle line:84%
tell us that we are not who
we've been told in the past,

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:45.600 align:middle line:84%
much more than we've
been led to believe,

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:48.580 align:middle line:84%
and empower us to embrace
change in a healthy way.

00:01:48.580 --> 00:01:52.880 align:middle line:84%
And I just to ask you, just
as a general question, based

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:54.650 align:middle line:84%
on everything that
you've discovered now

00:01:54.650 --> 00:01:56.390 align:middle line:84%
and the things that
we shared, how do

00:01:56.390 --> 00:01:57.947 align:middle line:90%
you feel about our world today?

00:01:57.947 --> 00:01:59.405 align:middle line:84%
How do you feel
about where we are?

00:01:59.405 --> 00:02:00.440 align:middle line:90%
Are you optimistic?

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:01.340 align:middle line:90%
Are you pessimistic?

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:02.900 align:middle line:10%
>>LIPTON: Well, the
most important thing,

00:02:02.900 --> 00:02:04.983 align:middle line:10%
the way I see it right
now, is that we are exactly

00:02:04.983 --> 00:02:06.980 align:middle line:10%
where we are supposed
to be, that we're

00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:08.720 align:middle line:10%
in a process of evolution.

00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:12.320 align:middle line:84%
And we're moving from a
non-sustainable world into one

00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:14.060 align:middle line:90%
that is sustainable--

00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:15.670 align:middle line:84%
very significant
in that is there's

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:17.350 align:middle line:84%
a structure of the world
that we're living in,

00:02:17.350 --> 00:02:18.950 align:middle line:84%
and it turns out
science has revealed

00:02:18.950 --> 00:02:21.873 align:middle line:84%
that the culture that we
have created on this planet

00:02:21.873 --> 00:02:23.540 align:middle line:84%
is actually precipitating
what is called

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:25.040 align:middle line:84%
the sixth mass
extinction of life,

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:27.660 align:middle line:84%
which, of course, will
include humans, as well.

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:29.593 align:middle line:84%
And since it's based
on human behavior,

00:02:29.593 --> 00:02:31.010 align:middle line:84%
the only way out
of the problem is

00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:33.860 align:middle line:84%
to change human behavior,
which, by definition, change

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:34.940 align:middle line:90%
human culture.

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:38.600 align:middle line:84%
So we're in a process where
the culture that we were raised

00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:42.950 align:middle line:84%
with has to come down so
we can build on a better

00:02:42.950 --> 00:02:44.210 align:middle line:90%
foundation, a culture we can--

00:02:44.210 --> 00:02:44.330 align:middle line:90%
>>GREGG: Absolutely

00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:45.997 align:middle line:84%
>>LIPTON: --thrive
into the future with.

00:02:45.997 --> 00:02:49.850 align:middle line:84%
So we're in the process of
the original one coming down

00:02:49.850 --> 00:02:52.388 align:middle line:84%
and a new one forming
at the same time.

00:02:52.388 --> 00:02:53.930 align:middle line:84%
And when you look
outside and you go,

00:02:53.930 --> 00:02:55.763 align:middle line:84%
oh, my god, it looked
kind of crazy outside.

00:02:55.763 --> 00:02:59.270 align:middle line:84%
Well, that would be the
appearance of this chaos,

00:02:59.270 --> 00:03:02.180 align:middle line:84%
as an old system
is disassembling

00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:05.310 align:middle line:84%
and a new system
is coming together.

00:03:05.310 --> 00:03:06.810 align:middle line:84%
And so are we in
the right place?

00:03:06.810 --> 00:03:08.640 align:middle line:84%
I think we're exactly
in the right place.

00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:10.490 align:middle line:84%
>>GREGG: Well, it fits
right into the model

00:03:10.490 --> 00:03:13.860 align:middle line:84%
that both you and I have
adhered to independently.

00:03:13.860 --> 00:03:16.100 align:middle line:84%
And we both-- there's a
lot of overlap in the way

00:03:16.100 --> 00:03:18.707 align:middle line:84%
that we see in terms
of cycles and trends.

00:03:18.707 --> 00:03:20.540 align:middle line:84%
The only things breaking
down are the things

00:03:20.540 --> 00:03:21.680 align:middle line:90%
that are unsustainable.

00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:23.960 align:middle line:84%
If we waited for
the moment that we

00:03:23.960 --> 00:03:27.710 align:middle line:84%
needed a new way of thinking,
if we waited for that moment

00:03:27.710 --> 00:03:30.260 align:middle line:84%
to try to develop new ways
of living and thinking,

00:03:30.260 --> 00:03:31.590 align:middle line:90%
it'd be too late.

00:03:31.590 --> 00:03:35.490 align:middle line:84%
And the beauty is, now, for the
last half of the 20th century,

00:03:35.490 --> 00:03:37.830 align:middle line:84%
now the early part
of the 21st century,

00:03:37.830 --> 00:03:39.710 align:middle line:84%
we've already got
everything that we

00:03:39.710 --> 00:03:42.530 align:middle line:84%
need to implement the
new ways of thinking,

00:03:42.530 --> 00:03:46.130 align:middle line:84%
new ways of living, sustainable
ways of being in this world.

00:03:46.130 --> 00:03:48.380 align:middle line:84%
So it's not like we have
to go back to square one

00:03:48.380 --> 00:03:50.540 align:middle line:84%
and say, oh, god, now
what are we going to do?

00:03:50.540 --> 00:03:51.830 align:middle line:90%
We already know what to do.

00:03:51.830 --> 00:03:53.790 align:middle line:84%
And it makes that
transition so much easier.

00:03:53.790 --> 00:03:54.770 align:middle line:90%
I think the key--

00:03:54.770 --> 00:03:58.790 align:middle line:84%
I'm finding the key is to
make the new discoveries

00:03:58.790 --> 00:04:02.630 align:middle line:84%
accessible to a broad, general
audience, rather than the very

00:04:02.630 --> 00:04:04.920 align:middle line:90%
specific audiences.

00:04:04.920 --> 00:04:07.400 align:middle line:84%
In the scientific
community, for example,

00:04:07.400 --> 00:04:10.700 align:middle line:84%
they publish in
peer-reviewed journals that

00:04:10.700 --> 00:04:12.200 align:middle line:90%
are only read by their peers.

00:04:12.200 --> 00:04:14.610 align:middle line:84%
You don't see that in the
broad, general audience.

00:04:14.610 --> 00:04:17.870 align:middle line:84%
So how, in your opinion,
what is the best way?

00:04:17.870 --> 00:04:21.015 align:middle line:84%
How can we share this so
that people can thrive?

00:04:21.015 --> 00:04:23.390 align:middle line:84%
>>LIPTON: What we're really
in a position to do right now

00:04:23.390 --> 00:04:26.520 align:middle line:84%
is recognize a very important
fact-- knowledge is power.

00:04:26.520 --> 00:04:28.395 align:middle line:84%
And while people
have heard that, it's

00:04:28.395 --> 00:04:30.770 align:middle line:84%
more important to hear the
corollary, a lack of knowledge

00:04:30.770 --> 00:04:32.050 align:middle line:90%
is a lack of power.

00:04:32.050 --> 00:04:33.800 align:middle line:84%
And we have been
deprived of the knowledge

00:04:33.800 --> 00:04:36.550 align:middle line:84%
that people know at the front
end, the head scientists,

00:04:36.550 --> 00:04:38.800 align:middle line:90%
the head economic people.

00:04:38.800 --> 00:04:40.998 align:middle line:84%
And they talk in their
own circles, as you said.

00:04:40.998 --> 00:04:43.040 align:middle line:84%
But until that information
comes into the public,

00:04:43.040 --> 00:04:44.930 align:middle line:84%
then the public has no
power to deal with this.

00:04:44.930 --> 00:04:45.320 align:middle line:90%
>>GREGG: Right.

00:04:45.320 --> 00:04:47.450 align:middle line:84%
>>LIPTON: So the first
part of our evolution

00:04:47.450 --> 00:04:50.460 align:middle line:84%
is, first, we must wake up,
and wake up to who we are,

00:04:50.460 --> 00:04:52.268 align:middle line:84%
what we are, and
where we're going,

00:04:52.268 --> 00:04:53.810 align:middle line:84%
and this information
is not available

00:04:53.810 --> 00:04:56.610 align:middle line:84%
in conventional schools and
conventional curriculum.

00:04:56.610 --> 00:04:59.810 align:middle line:84%
So it's a time for us
to bring to the public--

00:04:59.810 --> 00:05:01.730 align:middle line:84%
when we get a chance
to present, we

00:05:01.730 --> 00:05:04.670 align:middle line:84%
present stuff that is really,
only discussed at some higher

00:05:04.670 --> 00:05:06.560 align:middle line:90%
level and never comes down--

00:05:06.560 --> 00:05:10.040 align:middle line:84%
and why we do this
and it's so important

00:05:10.040 --> 00:05:13.310 align:middle line:84%
is then we give the public
this knowledge, which empowers

00:05:13.310 --> 00:05:14.340 align:middle line:90%
them to make the change.

00:05:14.340 --> 00:05:18.110 align:middle line:84%
So the knowledge is, yeah,
we're going through an evolution

00:05:18.110 --> 00:05:20.960 align:middle line:84%
that when you see the world
looking kind of crazy,

00:05:20.960 --> 00:05:22.877 align:middle line:84%
that's not a scary
thing, that's actually

00:05:22.877 --> 00:05:24.710 align:middle line:84%
one of the most hopeful
things in the world.

00:05:24.710 --> 00:05:27.540 align:middle line:84%
Because if it actually
stayed the same,

00:05:27.540 --> 00:05:30.380 align:middle line:84%
we would have a much more
rapid extinction process

00:05:30.380 --> 00:05:31.620 align:middle line:90%
than we have right now.

00:05:31.620 --> 00:05:32.810 align:middle line:84%
>>GREGG: Well, again, and
we've talked about this

00:05:32.810 --> 00:05:35.330 align:middle line:84%
before, the only things that
are really unraveling right now

00:05:35.330 --> 00:05:37.477 align:middle line:84%
are the things that
are unsustainable.

00:05:37.477 --> 00:05:39.060 align:middle line:84%
And they're based
on a way of thinking

00:05:39.060 --> 00:05:42.530 align:middle line:84%
that was introduced in the mid
1800s, when Darwin introduced

00:05:42.530 --> 00:05:43.880 align:middle line:90%
his idea--

00:05:43.880 --> 00:05:45.950 align:middle line:84%
I met with a group of
young people recently,

00:05:45.950 --> 00:05:49.090 align:middle line:84%
and when you talk about the
1800s to a group of millennials

00:05:49.090 --> 00:05:51.290 align:middle line:84%
it's like, you look at
their eyes and it's just--

00:05:51.290 --> 00:05:52.610 align:middle line:90%
they can't even fath--

00:05:52.610 --> 00:05:53.540 align:middle line:84%
they look at me and
they say, well, you

00:05:53.540 --> 00:05:55.050 align:middle line:84%
were born in the 20th
century, you know?

00:05:55.050 --> 00:05:56.460 align:middle line:84%
And that was,
like, last century.

00:05:56.460 --> 00:06:00.620 align:middle line:84%
So they're already
thinking along the lines

00:06:00.620 --> 00:06:02.570 align:middle line:90%
that these are old discoveries.

00:06:02.570 --> 00:06:05.270 align:middle line:84%
And so they asked me, they
said, OK, Gregg, Darwin,

00:06:05.270 --> 00:06:09.442 align:middle line:84%
mid 1800s, 1859, he published
his book, "Origin of Species."

00:06:09.442 --> 00:06:11.150 align:middle line:84%
This is the 21st
century, what difference

00:06:11.150 --> 00:06:12.178 align:middle line:90%
could it possibly make?

00:06:12.178 --> 00:06:13.220 align:middle line:90%
And it's a good question.

00:06:13.220 --> 00:06:17.720 align:middle line:84%
And when I tell them that
the society that we have come

00:06:17.720 --> 00:06:19.920 align:middle line:84%
to depend upon, that
we're living in today,

00:06:19.920 --> 00:06:21.830 align:middle line:84%
the foundations
that society were

00:06:21.830 --> 00:06:24.800 align:middle line:84%
built in late
1800s, early 1900s,

00:06:24.800 --> 00:06:27.860 align:middle line:84%
upon the principles that
were embraced quickly,

00:06:27.860 --> 00:06:29.610 align:middle line:84%
that were introduced
by Charles Darwin.

00:06:29.610 --> 00:06:33.125 align:middle line:84%
So the economic
principles of competition,

00:06:33.125 --> 00:06:36.410 align:middle line:84%
the corporate system, the
way we share vital resources.

00:06:36.410 --> 00:06:38.420 align:middle line:84%
So this is why I think
it's so important that we

00:06:38.420 --> 00:06:39.232 align:middle line:90%
have a new story.

00:06:39.232 --> 00:06:40.940 align:middle line:84%
>>LIPTON: It has to
be, because the story

00:06:40.940 --> 00:06:42.170 align:middle line:90%
is the cause of the problem.

00:06:42.170 --> 00:06:44.090 align:middle line:84%
So right away, it says
you can't solve a problem

00:06:44.090 --> 00:06:45.860 align:middle line:84%
with the same thinking
that created the problem.

00:06:45.860 --> 00:06:46.750 align:middle line:90%
Albert said that.

00:06:46.750 --> 00:06:47.160 align:middle line:90%
>>GREGG: Yeah.

00:06:47.160 --> 00:06:49.452 align:middle line:84%
>>LIPTON: And the reality is
new thinking is coming in,

00:06:49.452 --> 00:06:51.562 align:middle line:84%
thank god, because
there is an opportunity

00:06:51.562 --> 00:06:52.520 align:middle line:90%
to change the thinking.

00:06:52.520 --> 00:06:54.560 align:middle line:84%
And it's interesting because
the millennial generation people

00:06:54.560 --> 00:06:56.685 align:middle line:84%
are the ones, of course,
that haven't been so fully

00:06:56.685 --> 00:06:58.250 align:middle line:84%
groomed with the
old belief system,

00:06:58.250 --> 00:07:01.020 align:middle line:84%
that they're still open to
have another option presented

00:07:01.020 --> 00:07:01.820 align:middle line:90%
to them.

00:07:01.820 --> 00:07:02.630 align:middle line:90%
>>GREGG: Sure.

00:07:02.630 --> 00:07:05.172 align:middle line:84%
>>LIPTON: And what we're seeing
from the front end of science

00:07:05.172 --> 00:07:07.940 align:middle line:84%
is, oh, my god, the
new sciences are really

00:07:07.940 --> 00:07:10.940 align:middle line:84%
all about self empowerment--
how we can control our lives,

00:07:10.940 --> 00:07:13.280 align:middle line:84%
control our health, create
what we're unfolding.

00:07:13.280 --> 00:07:15.205 align:middle line:84%
And one of the ones
that I love the most

00:07:15.205 --> 00:07:17.330 align:middle line:84%
is because it's so basic,
fundamental to everything

00:07:17.330 --> 00:07:19.680 align:middle line:84%
in the world, and this
comes from quantum physics,

00:07:19.680 --> 00:07:21.890 align:middle line:84%
which is the most valid
science on this planet.

00:07:21.890 --> 00:07:23.630 align:middle line:84%
There is no science
with more truth.

00:07:23.630 --> 00:07:25.700 align:middle line:84%
And the first principle
of quantum physics

00:07:25.700 --> 00:07:29.270 align:middle line:84%
is consciousness is creating
our life experiences.

00:07:29.270 --> 00:07:31.860 align:middle line:10%
And I go, well, a
profoundly simple statement,

00:07:31.860 --> 00:07:33.620 align:middle line:10%
but profoundly simple meaning.

00:07:33.620 --> 00:07:36.200 align:middle line:10%
And that is, if you
change your consciousness,

00:07:36.200 --> 00:07:38.600 align:middle line:10%
then you change your
life experiences.

00:07:38.600 --> 00:07:39.990 align:middle line:90%
And this is what we need to do.

00:07:39.990 --> 00:07:43.790 align:middle line:84%
We have to get out of the old
consciousness of limitation,

00:07:43.790 --> 00:07:48.320 align:middle line:84%
old consciousness of
competition and that violence

00:07:48.320 --> 00:07:50.970 align:middle line:84%
is a necessary part
of our biology, which

00:07:50.970 --> 00:07:53.210 align:middle line:84%
the Germans actually
wrote in a science paper

00:07:53.210 --> 00:07:57.110 align:middle line:84%
that war is a necessary
part of our evolution.

00:07:57.110 --> 00:07:58.003 align:middle line:90%
>>GREGG: Yeah.

00:07:58.003 --> 00:07:59.420 align:middle line:84%
>>LIPTON: And so
these old beliefs

00:07:59.420 --> 00:08:01.370 align:middle line:90%
are really holding us behind.

00:08:01.370 --> 00:08:03.230 align:middle line:84%
And the new beliefs
are more important,

00:08:03.230 --> 00:08:05.840 align:middle line:84%
because the new beliefs
take us into community.

00:08:05.840 --> 00:08:08.450 align:middle line:84%
Rather, Darwinian theories
are based on individual.

00:08:08.450 --> 00:08:13.460 align:middle line:84%
Who's the most fit,
the fittest individual?

00:08:13.460 --> 00:08:14.870 align:middle line:84%
And I say, well,
wow, that's just

00:08:14.870 --> 00:08:17.050 align:middle line:84%
basic competition-- who's
going to find they're

00:08:17.050 --> 00:08:18.050 align:middle line:90%
going to be the fittest?

00:08:18.050 --> 00:08:19.850 align:middle line:84%
Who's going to
fight for the top?

00:08:19.850 --> 00:08:22.860 align:middle line:84%
And I say the new biology is,
like, not based on the fittest.

00:08:22.860 --> 00:08:26.390 align:middle line:84%
It's based on those that
can fit in the best, those

00:08:26.390 --> 00:08:28.430 align:middle line:84%
that can adapt the
best, those that

00:08:28.430 --> 00:08:30.197 align:middle line:90%
live in a community in harmony.

00:08:30.197 --> 00:08:32.030 align:middle line:84%
So all of a sudden, it
says evolution is not

00:08:32.030 --> 00:08:34.880 align:middle line:84%
the separation based on
one individual competing

00:08:34.880 --> 00:08:36.230 align:middle line:90%
with another individual.

00:08:36.230 --> 00:08:38.130 align:middle line:84%
The evolution is the
people coming together

00:08:38.130 --> 00:08:41.240 align:middle line:84%
in a community and
sharing awareness, which

00:08:41.240 --> 00:08:44.030 align:middle line:84%
is the foundation of a process
called emergence, which

00:08:44.030 --> 00:08:47.270 align:middle line:84%
means you may know all
the individual pieces-- so

00:08:47.270 --> 00:08:50.930 align:middle line:84%
for example, an electric
engineering person

00:08:50.930 --> 00:08:55.520 align:middle line:84%
knows a resistor, a capacitor,
a transistor, transformers,

00:08:55.520 --> 00:08:56.812 align:middle line:90%
all these pieces.

00:08:56.812 --> 00:08:59.270 align:middle line:10%
And the reality is, well, you
have all the knowledge of all

00:08:59.270 --> 00:09:00.687 align:middle line:10%
the pieces, but
it's only when you

00:09:00.687 --> 00:09:03.590 align:middle line:10%
can put the pieces together
and create something

00:09:03.590 --> 00:09:04.750 align:middle line:10%
like a computer--

00:09:04.750 --> 00:09:06.410 align:middle line:10%
the computer comes
out of the pieces.

00:09:06.410 --> 00:09:08.628 align:middle line:84%
You can't see the
computer in the pieces.

00:09:08.628 --> 00:09:10.670 align:middle line:84%
You can only, when you're
bringing them together,

00:09:10.670 --> 00:09:11.492 align:middle line:90%
see that.

00:09:11.492 --> 00:09:13.700 align:middle line:84%
And so what we're in a very
similar kind of emergence

00:09:13.700 --> 00:09:14.540 align:middle line:90%
right now.

00:09:14.540 --> 00:09:17.030 align:middle line:84%
We have a lot of intelligence
about a lot of things.

00:09:17.030 --> 00:09:19.250 align:middle line:84%
But until it all comes
together and creates

00:09:19.250 --> 00:09:23.120 align:middle line:84%
the image of the
future, then we're

00:09:23.120 --> 00:09:24.440 align:middle line:90%
capable of moving into that.

00:09:24.440 --> 00:09:26.398 align:middle line:84%
>>GREGG: Well, I think--
and what you're saying

00:09:26.398 --> 00:09:29.930 align:middle line:84%
is it happens on levels
within levels within levels.

00:09:29.930 --> 00:09:32.480 align:middle line:84%
And for me-- and I
recognize this when I was

00:09:32.480 --> 00:09:35.300 align:middle line:84%
in the corporations-- the most
fundamental levels is that we

00:09:35.300 --> 00:09:38.780 align:middle line:84%
have taken nature,
compartmentalized nature

00:09:38.780 --> 00:09:41.420 align:middle line:84%
in these little boxes that
we're comfortable studying,

00:09:41.420 --> 00:09:42.920 align:middle line:90%
like a box called geology--

00:09:42.920 --> 00:09:43.800 align:middle line:90%
I'm a geologist--

00:09:43.800 --> 00:09:44.120 align:middle line:90%
>>LIPTON: Yeah.

00:09:44.120 --> 00:09:46.160 align:middle line:84%
>>GREGG: --chemistry
or physics or biology.

00:09:46.160 --> 00:09:47.960 align:middle line:84%
Nature doesn't know
about those boxes.

00:09:47.960 --> 00:09:48.843 align:middle line:90%
There is no boundary.

00:09:48.843 --> 00:09:50.510 align:middle line:84%
Where do you draw the
line between where

00:09:50.510 --> 00:09:52.850 align:middle line:84%
does chemistry end
and biology begin?

00:09:52.850 --> 00:09:56.120 align:middle line:84%
Where does quantum physics
end and everything else begin?

00:09:56.120 --> 00:09:58.350 align:middle line:84%
The answer is the minute
you draw that line,

00:09:58.350 --> 00:10:00.020 align:middle line:84%
you're locked into
the separation

00:10:00.020 --> 00:10:01.340 align:middle line:90%
and the false assumptions.

00:10:01.340 --> 00:10:03.350 align:middle line:84%
So as a scientist,
I've always wanted

00:10:03.350 --> 00:10:04.910 align:middle line:90%
to ask you this question--

00:10:04.910 --> 00:10:09.320 align:middle line:84%
as a scientist, if
our world mirrored,

00:10:09.320 --> 00:10:11.480 align:middle line:84%
on a biological
level, everything

00:10:11.480 --> 00:10:14.078 align:middle line:84%
that you've found to be
true in cells and biology,

00:10:14.078 --> 00:10:15.620 align:middle line:84%
what would our world
look like today?

00:10:15.620 --> 00:10:20.690 align:middle line:84%
How would our world
model society, families,

00:10:20.690 --> 00:10:23.773 align:middle line:84%
populations after what the
cell is teaching us about life?

00:10:23.773 --> 00:10:25.190 align:middle line:84%
>>LIPTON: Well,
the first thing we

00:10:25.190 --> 00:10:26.607 align:middle line:84%
have to understand
about a cell is

00:10:26.607 --> 00:10:28.490 align:middle line:84%
that all of the functions
that are in a human

00:10:28.490 --> 00:10:30.448 align:middle line:84%
are already present in
almost all of our cells.

00:10:30.448 --> 00:10:32.928 align:middle line:84%
So a human doesn't have
anything new that a cell has.

00:10:32.928 --> 00:10:34.220 align:middle line:90%
And I say then what is a human?

00:10:34.220 --> 00:10:37.520 align:middle line:84%
I say, well, we see it as an
individual, as a one entity.

00:10:37.520 --> 00:10:40.960 align:middle line:84%
The truth is a human has a
community of 50 trillion cells.

00:10:40.960 --> 00:10:41.800 align:middle line:90%
And guess what?

00:10:41.800 --> 00:10:42.790 align:middle line:90%
Cells have jobs.

00:10:42.790 --> 00:10:44.020 align:middle line:90%
Cells have an economy.

00:10:44.020 --> 00:10:45.520 align:middle line:90%
Cells have a health care system.

00:10:45.520 --> 00:10:47.590 align:middle line:90%
They have a government.

00:10:47.590 --> 00:10:49.990 align:middle line:84%
All of the functions that we
express in our outer world

00:10:49.990 --> 00:10:52.450 align:middle line:84%
are totally reflected by
the functions expressed

00:10:52.450 --> 00:10:53.620 align:middle line:90%
on the inner world.

00:10:53.620 --> 00:10:55.210 align:middle line:84%
The relevance is
this, think about

00:10:55.210 --> 00:10:59.780 align:middle line:84%
that your body is made out of
50 trillion individual cells

00:10:59.780 --> 00:11:01.780 align:middle line:84%
and every cell is like
a miniature human.

00:11:01.780 --> 00:11:03.700 align:middle line:84%
I say, my goodness,
there's a community

00:11:03.700 --> 00:11:08.230 align:middle line:84%
of $50 trillion humans living
in harmony under our skin.

00:11:08.230 --> 00:11:10.150 align:middle line:84%
And all of a sudden,
I say, well, they

00:11:10.150 --> 00:11:12.400 align:middle line:84%
have the same needs and
the same requirements

00:11:12.400 --> 00:11:14.710 align:middle line:90%
that we, as individuals, have.

00:11:14.710 --> 00:11:17.620 align:middle line:84%
And the new science, which
is called biomimicry,

00:11:17.620 --> 00:11:19.225 align:middle line:84%
is really the
leading edge science

00:11:19.225 --> 00:11:22.090 align:middle line:84%
that says, well, how can 50
trillion cells live in harmony

00:11:22.090 --> 00:11:24.100 align:middle line:84%
and work together
and create health?

00:11:24.100 --> 00:11:26.710 align:middle line:84%
And the idea is once you
start to look inside and see

00:11:26.710 --> 00:11:29.210 align:middle line:84%
the exchanges of how they
relate to each other,

00:11:29.210 --> 00:11:32.230 align:middle line:84%
how there's an economy, there's
actually a money moving around

00:11:32.230 --> 00:11:35.890 align:middle line:84%
in the system, and you
start to realize the economy

00:11:35.890 --> 00:11:38.560 align:middle line:84%
and the biology is so
different than the economy

00:11:38.560 --> 00:11:41.290 align:middle line:84%
in our human world that
once-- if you understand

00:11:41.290 --> 00:11:44.350 align:middle line:84%
the biology inside
the economy, we

00:11:44.350 --> 00:11:46.270 align:middle line:84%
can create a healthy
world out here.

00:11:46.270 --> 00:11:48.880 align:middle line:10%
There's only 8 billion of us
and there's 50 trillion cells

00:11:48.880 --> 00:11:49.813 align:middle line:10%
inside.

00:11:49.813 --> 00:11:50.980 align:middle line:90%
They have a lot to teach us.

00:11:50.980 --> 00:11:54.790 align:middle line:84%
And fortunately for me, I was
excited to be a cell biologist.

00:11:54.790 --> 00:11:58.870 align:middle line:84%
Because I observed cells
for many, many, many years,

00:11:58.870 --> 00:12:01.690 align:middle line:84%
and cloning them and studying
them and seeing how they work.

00:12:01.690 --> 00:12:03.700 align:middle line:84%
And that's what helped
change my entire life

00:12:03.700 --> 00:12:07.225 align:middle line:84%
because I didn't take
my lessons from society

00:12:07.225 --> 00:12:08.350 align:middle line:90%
and the conventional stuff.

00:12:08.350 --> 00:12:10.990 align:middle line:90%
I took them from the cells.

00:12:10.990 --> 00:12:12.850 align:middle line:84%
And once I started
to live according

00:12:12.850 --> 00:12:15.100 align:middle line:84%
to the principles
the cells taught me,

00:12:15.100 --> 00:12:17.380 align:middle line:84%
my life completely
changed on this planet.

00:12:17.380 --> 00:12:21.798 align:middle line:84%
And I've been living in
harmony with the environment--

00:12:21.798 --> 00:12:23.965 align:middle line:84%
as you said, it's not just
living with other people.

00:12:23.965 --> 00:12:26.110 align:middle line:84%
It's living with
everything else around us--

00:12:26.110 --> 00:12:30.340 align:middle line:84%
the chemistry, the energy,
the biology, the physics.

00:12:30.340 --> 00:12:32.710 align:middle line:84%
Once you learn to live in
harmony with that, then

00:12:32.710 --> 00:12:35.020 align:middle line:84%
all of a sudden you're on
a whole different plane.

00:12:35.020 --> 00:12:37.000 align:middle line:84%
A healthy human
body is a reflection

00:12:37.000 --> 00:12:38.640 align:middle line:90%
of a healthy community.

00:12:38.640 --> 00:12:39.440 align:middle line:90%
>>GREGG: Exactly.

00:12:39.440 --> 00:12:40.898 align:middle line:84%
>>LIPTON: And this
is what we need.

00:12:40.898 --> 00:12:44.080 align:middle line:84%
And just before I end on
that very simple point,

00:12:44.080 --> 00:12:46.510 align:middle line:84%
in our world today people
are fighting each other.

00:12:46.510 --> 00:12:50.560 align:middle line:84%
And in bodies where the
cells fight each other,

00:12:50.560 --> 00:12:54.400 align:middle line:84%
disease is called autoimmune
disease, which by definition

00:12:54.400 --> 00:12:55.840 align:middle line:90%
means self-destruction.

00:12:55.840 --> 00:12:57.640 align:middle line:84%
And it's interesting
because we're

00:12:57.640 --> 00:13:00.070 align:middle line:84%
experiencing a self-destruction
in our society.

00:13:00.070 --> 00:13:02.620 align:middle line:84%
And the more self-destruction
in our society-- guess what--

00:13:02.620 --> 00:13:04.720 align:middle line:84%
the more the individuals
are reflecting that

00:13:04.720 --> 00:13:06.520 align:middle line:90%
in their own inner society.

00:13:06.520 --> 00:13:09.460 align:middle line:84%
So autoimmune diseases
are on the rise,

00:13:09.460 --> 00:13:13.510 align:middle line:84%
because autoimmune disease is
affecting the human population.

00:13:13.510 --> 00:13:16.360 align:middle line:84%
And the basis says, how can
you get to harmony again?

00:13:16.360 --> 00:13:19.930 align:middle line:84%
The answer is stop fighting
each other and, all of a sudden,

00:13:19.930 --> 00:13:21.840 align:middle line:84%
we have a doorway to
peace and happiness.

00:13:21.840 --> 00:13:22.210 align:middle line:90%
>>GREGG: Sure.

00:13:22.210 --> 00:13:23.770 align:middle line:84%
So I'm thinking about
everything that we're saying

00:13:23.770 --> 00:13:25.780 align:middle line:84%
and a question that
comes to my mind,

00:13:25.780 --> 00:13:27.998 align:middle line:84%
and people have asked
us this question,

00:13:27.998 --> 00:13:30.040 align:middle line:84%
is when it comes to the
term survival-- you know,

00:13:30.040 --> 00:13:31.390 align:middle line:84%
it means different things
to different people.

00:13:31.390 --> 00:13:33.340 align:middle line:84%
But if nature is
not, in fact, based

00:13:33.340 --> 00:13:36.350 align:middle line:84%
upon Darwin's idea of
competition, then what does it

00:13:36.350 --> 00:13:37.150 align:middle line:90%
mean to survive?

00:13:37.150 --> 00:13:38.442 align:middle line:90%
What is that really telling us?

00:13:38.442 --> 00:13:39.900 align:middle line:84%
>>LIPTON: Well,
it's very important

00:13:39.900 --> 00:13:42.070 align:middle line:84%
to understand that below
our consciousness level,

00:13:42.070 --> 00:13:44.570 align:middle line:84%
even below our basic
level of awareness,

00:13:44.570 --> 00:13:47.080 align:middle line:84%
there's something called
the biological imperative.

00:13:47.080 --> 00:13:50.380 align:middle line:84%
The biological imperative
is the drive to survive.

00:13:50.380 --> 00:13:52.845 align:middle line:84%
Every organism, from a
bacterium up to a human--

00:13:52.845 --> 00:13:54.220 align:middle line:84%
you try to kill
a bacterium, it's

00:13:54.220 --> 00:13:56.290 align:middle line:84%
not going to sit there
and go, oh, OK, kill me.

00:13:56.290 --> 00:13:58.040 align:middle line:84%
It's going to do
everything to stay alive.

00:13:58.040 --> 00:14:00.490 align:middle line:84%
So every organism is
driven to stay alive.

00:14:00.490 --> 00:14:01.290 align:middle line:90%
>>GREGG: Right.

00:14:01.290 --> 00:14:02.980 align:middle line:84%
>>LIPTON: Now the significance
is, well, what does it mean?

00:14:02.980 --> 00:14:05.272 align:middle line:84%
Well, as an individual, that
means, well, first of all,

00:14:05.272 --> 00:14:09.070 align:middle line:84%
you have to have air, water,
food, safety, shelter,

00:14:09.070 --> 00:14:10.660 align:middle line:90%
and something to do.

00:14:10.660 --> 00:14:12.350 align:middle line:90%
And why is this important?

00:14:12.350 --> 00:14:14.380 align:middle line:84%
Because if we fulfill
those basics, which

00:14:14.380 --> 00:14:17.620 align:middle line:84%
are the basics of life,
then the drive to survive

00:14:17.620 --> 00:14:19.450 align:middle line:90%
has been fulfilled.

00:14:19.450 --> 00:14:21.710 align:middle line:84%
And to do that also
involves community.

00:14:21.710 --> 00:14:22.510 align:middle line:90%
Why?

00:14:22.510 --> 00:14:24.520 align:middle line:84%
Because if some person
is dropping out and not

00:14:24.520 --> 00:14:27.003 align:middle line:84%
doing well, then other
people in the community

00:14:27.003 --> 00:14:28.420 align:middle line:84%
are supposed to
be there to, what?

00:14:28.420 --> 00:14:29.770 align:middle line:90%
Lift them up and bring them up.

00:14:29.770 --> 00:14:32.120 align:middle line:90%
Dolphins do this all the time.

00:14:32.120 --> 00:14:34.090 align:middle line:84%
One of them is not doing
well, other dolphins

00:14:34.090 --> 00:14:36.040 align:middle line:84%
will swim underneath
and lift them up

00:14:36.040 --> 00:14:38.330 align:middle line:84%
so they can breathe the air
and then come back down.

00:14:38.330 --> 00:14:41.740 align:middle line:84%
That's called working in harmony
and working in a community.

00:14:41.740 --> 00:14:43.900 align:middle line:84%
And community is the
evolutionary endpoint

00:14:43.900 --> 00:14:45.040 align:middle line:90%
that we're looking for.

00:14:45.040 --> 00:14:47.350 align:middle line:84%
Because as you can see
in the world right now,

00:14:47.350 --> 00:14:49.300 align:middle line:84%
it's so broken up into
small, little groups

00:14:49.300 --> 00:14:50.477 align:middle line:90%
and here and here.

00:14:50.477 --> 00:14:52.060 align:middle line:84%
But until they
integrate and recognize

00:14:52.060 --> 00:14:54.310 align:middle line:84%
we're all one living
community, then

00:14:54.310 --> 00:14:56.080 align:middle line:84%
survival takes on a
different meaning.

00:14:56.080 --> 00:14:58.635 align:middle line:84%
That means we support each
other in this process.

00:14:58.635 --> 00:15:01.010 align:middle line:84%
And all of a sudden, the idea
of competition, which says,

00:15:01.010 --> 00:15:02.680 align:middle line:84%
look, I got my food and
you don't have yours

00:15:02.680 --> 00:15:04.300 align:middle line:84%
and that's just the
Darwinian theory

00:15:04.300 --> 00:15:08.260 align:middle line:84%
and we're OK with it, that's
not OK in a world based

00:15:08.260 --> 00:15:09.500 align:middle line:90%
on cooperation and community.

00:15:09.500 --> 00:15:10.300 align:middle line:90%
>>GREGG: Yeah.

00:15:10.300 --> 00:15:11.100 align:middle line:90%
It can't be.

00:15:11.100 --> 00:15:15.370 align:middle line:10%
I think we're moving from
the thinking of surviving

00:15:15.370 --> 00:15:17.245 align:middle line:10%
to the understanding
it's possible to thrive.

00:15:17.245 --> 00:15:18.045 align:middle line:10%
>>LIPTON: Yes.

00:15:18.045 --> 00:15:20.000 align:middle line:84%
>>GREGG: Survival leaves
us with the feeling

00:15:20.000 --> 00:15:21.250 align:middle line:90%
we're just getting by.

00:15:21.250 --> 00:15:23.860 align:middle line:84%
Thriving suggests
that regardless

00:15:23.860 --> 00:15:26.740 align:middle line:84%
of what the circumstances
are, how they change,

00:15:26.740 --> 00:15:29.980 align:middle line:84%
that we not just get
by, but we actually

00:15:29.980 --> 00:15:33.310 align:middle line:84%
are able to do just that--
to thrive, to rejuvenate,

00:15:33.310 --> 00:15:37.930 align:middle line:84%
to regenerate biologically,
and be very productive in terms

00:15:37.930 --> 00:15:40.580 align:middle line:90%
of the way we do this.

00:15:40.580 --> 00:15:42.960 align:middle line:84%
I'm an optimist but
I'm also a realist.

00:15:42.960 --> 00:15:45.105 align:middle line:84%
And I look into the world
for realistic examples.

00:15:45.105 --> 00:15:46.980 align:middle line:84%
And time after time,
I've written about these

00:15:46.980 --> 00:15:47.855 align:middle line:90%
in some of the books.

00:15:47.855 --> 00:15:50.550 align:middle line:10%
I have a book, "Deep Truth,"
where I talk about these.

00:15:50.550 --> 00:15:55.410 align:middle line:10%
We see examples of humans who
are in dire situations, life

00:15:55.410 --> 00:15:59.340 align:middle line:10%
and death situations, where
their lives and the lives

00:15:59.340 --> 00:16:03.540 align:middle line:10%
of themselves, or even other
animals, are threatened.

00:16:03.540 --> 00:16:05.310 align:middle line:10%
And time after
time, what you see

00:16:05.310 --> 00:16:09.240 align:middle line:10%
is there's a
subconscious trigger that

00:16:09.240 --> 00:16:10.770 align:middle line:10%
appears to kick in.

00:16:10.770 --> 00:16:13.020 align:middle line:84%
And at the risk of
their own safety,

00:16:13.020 --> 00:16:15.612 align:middle line:84%
people will put
themselves in harm's way.

00:16:15.612 --> 00:16:17.070 align:middle line:84%
When the floods
happened in Europe,

00:16:17.070 --> 00:16:19.860 align:middle line:84%
they were saving elephants
at the risk of being drowned.

00:16:19.860 --> 00:16:23.460 align:middle line:84%
Afghanistan and Baghdad,
there are more stories

00:16:23.460 --> 00:16:26.040 align:middle line:90%
than I could even recount of--

00:16:26.040 --> 00:16:29.610 align:middle line:84%
One, soldiers are in a Humvee,
someone tosses in the grenade,

00:16:29.610 --> 00:16:32.040 align:middle line:84%
and one soldier,
without even thinking,

00:16:32.040 --> 00:16:35.520 align:middle line:84%
throws his body on that
grenade and absorbs

00:16:35.520 --> 00:16:38.328 align:middle line:84%
the impact and the shrapnel
to save the people around him.

00:16:38.328 --> 00:16:40.120 align:middle line:10%
He didn't even have
time to think about it.

00:16:40.120 --> 00:16:42.630 align:middle line:84%
And that tells us
it's not something--

00:16:42.630 --> 00:16:43.920 align:middle line:90%
it's not based on logic.

00:16:43.920 --> 00:16:44.830 align:middle line:90%
It's who we are.

00:16:44.830 --> 00:16:46.122 align:middle line:90%
It's the essence of who we are.

00:16:46.122 --> 00:16:47.497 align:middle line:84%
And I think that's
the difference

00:16:47.497 --> 00:16:48.840 align:middle line:90%
between surviving and thriving.

00:16:48.840 --> 00:16:49.965 align:middle line:90%
>>LIPTON: Well, absolutely.

00:16:49.965 --> 00:16:51.720 align:middle line:84%
And it's so important
to recognize that.

00:16:51.720 --> 00:16:54.195 align:middle line:84%
For example, when the tsunami
came, we have a military.

00:16:54.195 --> 00:16:56.195 align:middle line:84%
And I said, what's the
function of the military?

00:16:56.195 --> 00:16:57.850 align:middle line:90%
It's like, that's protection.

00:16:57.850 --> 00:17:02.530 align:middle line:84%
And I go, yeah, but it's also
a reflection of arms and legs.

00:17:02.530 --> 00:17:04.530 align:middle line:84%
When I say, what's a
protection-- response, arms

00:17:04.530 --> 00:17:05.330 align:middle line:90%
and legs.

00:17:05.330 --> 00:17:08.187 align:middle line:84%
I said, well, the military
is society's arms and legs

00:17:08.187 --> 00:17:09.270 align:middle line:90%
to go out there and fight.

00:17:09.270 --> 00:17:12.210 align:middle line:10%
But you also brought up
a very important point.

00:17:12.210 --> 00:17:14.970 align:middle line:10%
The adrenaline that makes
a soldier go into war

00:17:14.970 --> 00:17:16.500 align:middle line:10%
is the same
adrenaline that makes

00:17:16.500 --> 00:17:19.500 align:middle line:10%
the firemen go into the burning
building to save a person.

00:17:19.500 --> 00:17:23.310 align:middle line:84%
And so basically, it says when
we use, as a system, the arms

00:17:23.310 --> 00:17:26.730 align:middle line:84%
and legs, the adrenal system,
and we only focus it on war

00:17:26.730 --> 00:17:30.508 align:middle line:84%
and create a military that
only fights, by definition,

00:17:30.508 --> 00:17:31.800 align:middle line:90%
then you better have some wars.

00:17:31.800 --> 00:17:34.300 align:middle line:84%
Because otherwise, what are you
doing with all these people?

00:17:34.300 --> 00:17:36.370 align:middle line:10%
Except when the tsunami
came, for example,

00:17:36.370 --> 00:17:38.230 align:middle line:10%
the military was
called in to do what?

00:17:38.230 --> 00:17:39.502 align:middle line:10%
Help the people.

00:17:39.502 --> 00:17:41.710 align:middle line:84%
And then when they talked
to the soldiers afterwards,

00:17:41.710 --> 00:17:44.610 align:middle line:84%
the soldiers said
that was their finest

00:17:44.610 --> 00:17:47.130 align:middle line:90%
hours of being in the service.

00:17:47.130 --> 00:17:50.370 align:middle line:10%
I go, this is exactly
the relationship.

00:17:50.370 --> 00:17:53.290 align:middle line:84%
I need the military
if there's a threat,

00:17:53.290 --> 00:17:54.950 align:middle line:84%
but I also need the
military to help.

00:17:54.950 --> 00:17:55.750 align:middle line:90%
>>GREGG: Sure.

00:17:55.750 --> 00:17:59.040 align:middle line:84%
>>LIPTON: And when the military
is doing the helping job,

00:17:59.040 --> 00:18:03.390 align:middle line:84%
it fulfills not just their
life, but it changes the world,

00:18:03.390 --> 00:18:04.632 align:middle line:90%
as well.

00:18:04.632 --> 00:18:06.090 align:middle line:84%
And so what we
really have to do is

00:18:06.090 --> 00:18:08.400 align:middle line:84%
recognize that the
military is really

00:18:08.400 --> 00:18:09.960 align:middle line:90%
the department of mobility.

00:18:09.960 --> 00:18:11.670 align:middle line:84%
Are we moving towards
something that we

00:18:11.670 --> 00:18:12.930 align:middle line:90%
don't want to get rid of?

00:18:12.930 --> 00:18:15.600 align:middle line:84%
Are we moving towards
something we want to build up?

00:18:15.600 --> 00:18:17.610 align:middle line:84%
The military should be
doing both of these.

00:18:17.610 --> 00:18:17.700 align:middle line:90%
>>GREGG: Yeah.

00:18:17.700 --> 00:18:18.630 align:middle line:90%
I've always said that.

00:18:18.630 --> 00:18:21.270 align:middle line:84%
I have friends of mine in the
military-- young men and women.

00:18:21.270 --> 00:18:23.370 align:middle line:84%
And yeah, they can
go into combat,

00:18:23.370 --> 00:18:25.920 align:middle line:84%
but they are really good
at rapid deployment.

00:18:25.920 --> 00:18:28.680 align:middle line:84%
They're good at building
hospitals within hours,

00:18:28.680 --> 00:18:31.450 align:middle line:84%
at distributing food,
shelter, and helping people

00:18:31.450 --> 00:18:32.250 align:middle line:90%
in times of need.

00:18:32.250 --> 00:18:34.458 align:middle line:84%
And as we're going through
this convergence, our time

00:18:34.458 --> 00:18:38.400 align:middle line:84%
of extremes, the chaos
of a changing world,

00:18:38.400 --> 00:18:40.920 align:middle line:84%
our extremes are becoming
more and more common.

00:18:40.920 --> 00:18:44.160 align:middle line:84%
And the intense weather that
we're seeing-- these tsunamis,

00:18:44.160 --> 00:18:46.870 align:middle line:84%
tornadoes, fires, all
those kinds of things--

00:18:46.870 --> 00:18:50.610 align:middle line:84%
and these people want-- it
is their natural desire.

00:18:50.610 --> 00:18:51.420 align:middle line:90%
They want to help.

00:18:51.420 --> 00:18:53.430 align:middle line:84%
And you're right, they
feel more fulfilled when

00:18:53.430 --> 00:18:54.597 align:middle line:90%
they do something like that.

00:18:54.597 --> 00:18:59.340 align:middle line:84%
So I think all of these help
us to see if we need something

00:18:59.340 --> 00:19:03.120 align:middle line:84%
to reinforce within ourselves
what our truest nature is--

00:19:03.120 --> 00:19:05.340 align:middle line:84%
that conflict,
competition, these

00:19:05.340 --> 00:19:06.900 align:middle line:90%
are learned characteristics.

00:19:06.900 --> 00:19:08.890 align:middle line:90%
It's not our truest nature.

00:19:08.890 --> 00:19:13.410 align:middle line:84%
So in looking at the most
basic unit of life as a model,

00:19:13.410 --> 00:19:16.140 align:middle line:84%
as a template, on the
microscopic level,

00:19:16.140 --> 00:19:18.463 align:middle line:84%
for what's happening
in the macro level--

00:19:18.463 --> 00:19:19.880 align:middle line:84%
although I'm an
earth scientist, I

00:19:19.880 --> 00:19:21.797 align:middle line:84%
have a strong background
in the life sciences.

00:19:21.797 --> 00:19:24.210 align:middle line:84%
I was an ocean science
major-- marine biology

00:19:24.210 --> 00:19:25.920 align:middle line:84%
and molecular
biology and all that.

00:19:25.920 --> 00:19:28.710 align:middle line:10%
And one of the
things that really,

00:19:28.710 --> 00:19:30.960 align:middle line:10%
really stood out for me--

00:19:30.960 --> 00:19:32.460 align:middle line:10%
and I didn't pursue
it to the degree

00:19:32.460 --> 00:19:34.650 align:middle line:10%
that you have as a biologist--

00:19:34.650 --> 00:19:36.660 align:middle line:10%
but whenever I would
study populations

00:19:36.660 --> 00:19:41.580 align:middle line:10%
of cells, the cells,
as a community,

00:19:41.580 --> 00:19:44.970 align:middle line:10%
every one of the cells had
to have the basic needs met

00:19:44.970 --> 00:19:48.960 align:middle line:10%
before the unit of cells
could move forward and evolve

00:19:48.960 --> 00:19:51.220 align:middle line:10%
and progress in a healthy way.

00:19:51.220 --> 00:19:53.730 align:middle line:84%
And I always felt
that we were being

00:19:53.730 --> 00:19:55.590 align:middle line:90%
shown something so profound.

00:19:55.590 --> 00:19:59.130 align:middle line:84%
Because if we apply that
idea to our communities

00:19:59.130 --> 00:20:01.630 align:middle line:84%
and to our world
and our populations,

00:20:01.630 --> 00:20:03.260 align:middle line:84%
I think that's a
powerful template.

00:20:03.260 --> 00:20:04.050 align:middle line:84%
Do you feel-- I
mean, do you see--

00:20:04.050 --> 00:20:05.280 align:middle line:84%
>>LIPTON: It's more than
a powerful template,

00:20:05.280 --> 00:20:07.322 align:middle line:84%
and I've been talking
about this for a long time.

00:20:07.322 --> 00:20:09.060 align:middle line:84%
Because as I said,
in the body there's

00:20:09.060 --> 00:20:11.160 align:middle line:90%
an exchange of currency.

00:20:11.160 --> 00:20:14.190 align:middle line:84%
It's called ATP--
adenosine triphosphate.

00:20:14.190 --> 00:20:15.917 align:middle line:90%
It's a coin of the realm.

00:20:15.917 --> 00:20:17.500 align:middle line:10%
That's what biologists
refer to it as.

00:20:17.500 --> 00:20:18.667 align:middle line:90%
>>GREGG: It's not a Bitcoin.

00:20:18.667 --> 00:20:21.570 align:middle line:84%
>>LIPTON: Not a very--
it's a very little bit.

00:20:21.570 --> 00:20:24.910 align:middle line:84%
And the idea about it is
that it's a unit of energy.

00:20:24.910 --> 00:20:28.560 align:middle line:84%
And what's interesting is
there is no wealth in the body

00:20:28.560 --> 00:20:31.680 align:middle line:84%
until every cell has
the basics of life.

00:20:31.680 --> 00:20:35.370 align:middle line:84%
Every cell has to be able
to be fed, protected,

00:20:35.370 --> 00:20:38.400 align:middle line:84%
have an environment, have a
job, and they all work together.

00:20:38.400 --> 00:20:42.660 align:middle line:84%
What's interesting then is
once every cell is covered,

00:20:42.660 --> 00:20:46.980 align:middle line:84%
any more energy
wealth in the system

00:20:46.980 --> 00:20:48.610 align:middle line:90%
now can go to individuals.

00:20:48.610 --> 00:20:52.000 align:middle line:84%
So there's another level that
says once everybody's covered,

00:20:52.000 --> 00:20:54.900 align:middle line:84%
then individual cells can
start to make more energy

00:20:54.900 --> 00:20:56.880 align:middle line:84%
and hold onto this
energy in their cells,

00:20:56.880 --> 00:20:59.470 align:middle line:84%
these units, these
coins of the realm.

00:20:59.470 --> 00:21:01.770 align:middle line:84%
And so the next level--
first level is everybody

00:21:01.770 --> 00:21:04.830 align:middle line:84%
first has to be given
the basics of life.

00:21:04.830 --> 00:21:08.250 align:middle line:84%
Then anything produced
after that is called wealth.

00:21:08.250 --> 00:21:10.200 align:middle line:84%
And the first level of
wealth is individuals

00:21:10.200 --> 00:21:12.600 align:middle line:84%
can accumulate wealth
because of their jobs.

00:21:12.600 --> 00:21:15.750 align:middle line:84%
Nerve cells have a lot
more ATP than a skin cell.

00:21:15.750 --> 00:21:19.410 align:middle line:84%
But it's all based on their
job and the energy required.

00:21:19.410 --> 00:21:20.910 align:middle line:84%
But what's also
interesting is this.

00:21:20.910 --> 00:21:26.100 align:middle line:84%
Because the wealth is a
coin, a molecular unit,

00:21:26.100 --> 00:21:28.020 align:middle line:90%
a cell can only have so much.

00:21:28.020 --> 00:21:33.330 align:middle line:84%
And it says once a cell has the
full complement of money, ATP,

00:21:33.330 --> 00:21:36.570 align:middle line:84%
that it can have,
any extra wealth then

00:21:36.570 --> 00:21:38.580 align:middle line:90%
goes into the community bank.

00:21:38.580 --> 00:21:41.160 align:middle line:84%
And the community bank is to
cover all contingencies-- you

00:21:41.160 --> 00:21:43.620 align:middle line:84%
break a leg, you have a
problem with your kidney,

00:21:43.620 --> 00:21:44.860 align:middle line:90%
or something like that.

00:21:44.860 --> 00:21:46.990 align:middle line:84%
There's a resource
to cover the system.

00:21:46.990 --> 00:21:48.990 align:middle line:84%
Now, this is completely
different than the world

00:21:48.990 --> 00:21:51.270 align:middle line:84%
we live in, which says
I can make as much money

00:21:51.270 --> 00:21:53.160 align:middle line:84%
as I want at the
expense of others

00:21:53.160 --> 00:21:55.210 align:middle line:90%
that don't have anything.

00:21:55.210 --> 00:21:57.645 align:middle line:84%
So some people can
have $60 billion

00:21:57.645 --> 00:22:00.360 align:middle line:84%
and then there's
a million people

00:22:00.360 --> 00:22:03.570 align:middle line:84%
living in a garbage pile, trying
to scrape some food together.

00:22:03.570 --> 00:22:06.310 align:middle line:84%
It's like, oh, my god, we are
so out of balance on this.

00:22:06.310 --> 00:22:07.140 align:middle line:84%
>>GREGG: Well,
those are Darwinian.

00:22:07.140 --> 00:22:08.325 align:middle line:90%
Those are Darwinian ideas.

00:22:08.325 --> 00:22:09.200 align:middle line:90%
>>LIPTON: Absolutely.

00:22:09.200 --> 00:22:10.060 align:middle line:90%
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:22:10.060 --> 00:22:12.240 align:middle line:84%
>>GREGG: So this is where
you and I, I think, have--

00:22:12.240 --> 00:22:14.190 align:middle line:90%
there's a potential here.

00:22:14.190 --> 00:22:15.940 align:middle line:90%
Because we can pass laws.

00:22:15.940 --> 00:22:16.740 align:middle line:90%
You can pass--

00:22:16.740 --> 00:22:21.030 align:middle line:84%
Congress passed, for example,
the anti-hate law in 2009,

00:22:21.030 --> 00:22:23.440 align:middle line:90%
making a hate crime illegal.

00:22:23.440 --> 00:22:26.710 align:middle line:84%
So you can make it illegal
to perform a hate crime,

00:22:26.710 --> 00:22:30.600 align:middle line:84%
but that law doesn't change the
fundamental thinking that leads

00:22:30.600 --> 00:22:32.050 align:middle line:90%
to the hate to begin with.

00:22:32.050 --> 00:22:34.950 align:middle line:84%
So what I'm seeing
is our society

00:22:34.950 --> 00:22:38.190 align:middle line:84%
is creating temporary
bandages, trying

00:22:38.190 --> 00:22:41.257 align:middle line:84%
to fix a problem without
understanding fundamentally

00:22:41.257 --> 00:22:42.090 align:middle line:90%
what the essence is.

00:22:42.090 --> 00:22:45.300 align:middle line:84%
And what you and I are doing is
we're transcending the bandage,

00:22:45.300 --> 00:22:48.570 align:middle line:84%
and we're going right to the
core of the thinking that

00:22:48.570 --> 00:22:51.600 align:middle line:84%
has led to the wound that
we're all dealing with.

00:22:51.600 --> 00:22:53.670 align:middle line:10%
And so my question--

00:22:53.670 --> 00:22:58.020 align:middle line:10%
Bruce, what do you think
is the most efficient way

00:22:58.020 --> 00:23:02.370 align:middle line:10%
to share this information in
a meaningful, applicable way

00:23:02.370 --> 00:23:06.340 align:middle line:10%
beyond our community that
has already embraced it,

00:23:06.340 --> 00:23:08.910 align:middle line:10%
beyond the choir
that we have the op--

00:23:08.910 --> 00:23:10.260 align:middle line:10%
we love the choir.

00:23:10.260 --> 00:23:12.355 align:middle line:84%
The choir are the people
that come and support

00:23:12.355 --> 00:23:14.230 align:middle line:84%
our work and our programs
all over the world.

00:23:14.230 --> 00:23:16.920 align:middle line:84%
But if we're going
to carry this right

00:23:16.920 --> 00:23:20.970 align:middle line:84%
to the core of corporations,
to the core of governments,

00:23:20.970 --> 00:23:24.240 align:middle line:84%
to the core of places
where this has the greatest

00:23:24.240 --> 00:23:27.180 align:middle line:84%
impact, in your opinion, what
would be the most efficient way

00:23:27.180 --> 00:23:28.930 align:middle line:84%
to do that in the
shortest period of time?

00:23:28.930 --> 00:23:29.820 align:middle line:84%
>>LIPTON: Well, the
most efficient way

00:23:29.820 --> 00:23:32.500 align:middle line:84%
is to get the leaders in each
one of these corporations,

00:23:32.500 --> 00:23:34.410 align:middle line:84%
government, whatever
entity they are,

00:23:34.410 --> 00:23:35.970 align:middle line:90%
is to give them the education.

00:23:35.970 --> 00:23:38.835 align:middle line:84%
Because they're still, like
everybody else, been programmed

00:23:38.835 --> 00:23:40.630 align:middle line:84%
with this negative
kind of programming,

00:23:40.630 --> 00:23:43.350 align:middle line:84%
such as the Darwinian
belief that competition

00:23:43.350 --> 00:23:44.550 align:middle line:90%
is a way of life.

00:23:44.550 --> 00:23:48.390 align:middle line:84%
And it's like, I always laugh
about that because competition

00:23:48.390 --> 00:23:50.460 align:middle line:84%
leads to the violence
to compete and then

00:23:50.460 --> 00:23:51.910 align:middle line:90%
to war and all that stuff.

00:23:51.910 --> 00:23:54.030 align:middle line:10%
And then if I say, well,
look at the garden--

00:23:54.030 --> 00:23:55.510 align:middle line:10%
I say, what is a garden?

00:23:55.510 --> 00:23:56.590 align:middle line:90%
It's not a battleground.

00:23:56.590 --> 00:24:00.100 align:middle line:84%
A garden is the highest
cooperation in the world.

00:24:00.100 --> 00:24:03.090 align:middle line:84%
So we want to
return to a garden.

00:24:03.090 --> 00:24:05.370 align:middle line:84%
But then we need
leaders that understand

00:24:05.370 --> 00:24:06.475 align:middle line:90%
what we're talking about.

00:24:06.475 --> 00:24:08.850 align:middle line:84%
And unfortunately, leaders
come from the old programming,

00:24:08.850 --> 00:24:11.990 align:middle line:84%
so they're just perpetuating the
same old beliefs over and over

00:24:11.990 --> 00:24:12.790 align:middle line:90%
again.

00:24:12.790 --> 00:24:15.930 align:middle line:84%
So when we see the system
collapsing, as it is right now,

00:24:15.930 --> 00:24:17.340 align:middle line:90%
this is the very important sign.

00:24:17.340 --> 00:24:20.190 align:middle line:84%
Because as I said, then there's
an opportunity for new leaders

00:24:20.190 --> 00:24:24.060 align:middle line:84%
that come in with an educational
background of the new world,

00:24:24.060 --> 00:24:26.580 align:middle line:84%
to then help us get
out of the old hole

00:24:26.580 --> 00:24:27.850 align:middle line:90%
and bring us into the new one.

00:24:27.850 --> 00:24:30.390 align:middle line:84%
So of course, that
requires the old system

00:24:30.390 --> 00:24:34.350 align:middle line:84%
to collapse and the
seeding of a new system

00:24:34.350 --> 00:24:37.020 align:middle line:84%
with a consciousness,
intelligence of what's

00:24:37.020 --> 00:24:39.360 align:middle line:84%
at the front edge,
not dredging up

00:24:39.360 --> 00:24:41.730 align:middle line:84%
the old beliefs from the
past and keep putting them

00:24:41.730 --> 00:24:42.840 align:middle line:90%
in when they don't work.

00:24:42.840 --> 00:24:43.470 align:middle line:90%
>>GREGG: You know where I'm--

00:24:43.470 --> 00:24:44.335 align:middle line:90%
I agree 100%.

00:24:44.335 --> 00:24:46.460 align:middle line:84%
And where I'm really
encouraged, where I'm sitting,

00:24:46.460 --> 00:24:48.520 align:middle line:90%
is with the young people.

00:24:48.520 --> 00:24:50.670 align:middle line:84%
I recently had the
opportunity to lead a group

00:24:50.670 --> 00:24:53.010 align:middle line:90%
through Israel, three weeks.

00:24:53.010 --> 00:24:57.150 align:middle line:84%
And we see Israel through
the lens of a television news

00:24:57.150 --> 00:24:59.960 align:middle line:84%
camera, from the perspective
of the people who

00:24:59.960 --> 00:25:03.060 align:middle line:84%
are creating those images,
what they think is important,

00:25:03.060 --> 00:25:04.310 align:middle line:90%
what they want us to see.

00:25:04.310 --> 00:25:05.670 align:middle line:84%
I have to tell you, when
you're on the ground--

00:25:05.670 --> 00:25:06.630 align:middle line:84%
and you've been
there, you know this--

00:25:06.630 --> 00:25:06.950 align:middle line:90%
>>LIPTON: Oh, yes.

00:25:06.950 --> 00:25:08.492 align:middle line:84%
>>GREGG: It's a very
different image.

00:25:08.492 --> 00:25:11.220 align:middle line:84%
And one of the things
that I was so--

00:25:11.220 --> 00:25:12.510 align:middle line:90%
I mean, I cried.

00:25:12.510 --> 00:25:15.180 align:middle line:84%
I literally cried when
I saw the young people,

00:25:15.180 --> 00:25:17.702 align:middle line:84%
the Palestinian children
and the Israeli children--

00:25:17.702 --> 00:25:20.160 align:middle line:84%
and when I say children, some
of them were in grade school,

00:25:20.160 --> 00:25:21.990 align:middle line:90%
some of them were young adults.

00:25:21.990 --> 00:25:23.370 align:middle line:90%
They were together in the parks.

00:25:23.370 --> 00:25:24.787 align:middle line:84%
They were together
on the beaches.

00:25:24.787 --> 00:25:25.850 align:middle line:90%
And we talked to them.

00:25:25.850 --> 00:25:27.350 align:middle line:84%
And they love to
test their English.

00:25:27.350 --> 00:25:27.930 align:middle line:90%
>>LIPTON: Yeah.

00:25:27.930 --> 00:25:29.680 align:middle line:84%
>>GREGG: And they had
Western t-shirts on,

00:25:29.680 --> 00:25:33.900 align:middle line:84%
saying, "We love America" or "We
love France" or whatever it is.

00:25:33.900 --> 00:25:34.860 align:middle line:90%
And we talked to them.

00:25:34.860 --> 00:25:36.990 align:middle line:84%
We said, what do you
see for your country?

00:25:36.990 --> 00:25:39.390 align:middle line:84%
And they said-- and
they were very honest.

00:25:39.390 --> 00:25:42.120 align:middle line:84%
They said, we
understand the past.

00:25:42.120 --> 00:25:44.190 align:middle line:90%
They're very aware of the past.

00:25:44.190 --> 00:25:46.470 align:middle line:84%
They said, we
understand the hurt

00:25:46.470 --> 00:25:48.510 align:middle line:84%
of our parents, that
our parents experienced

00:25:48.510 --> 00:25:49.920 align:middle line:90%
and our grandparents.

00:25:49.920 --> 00:25:52.410 align:middle line:84%
They said, but
it's not our hurt.

00:25:52.410 --> 00:25:55.160 align:middle line:84%
And they said, we're
ready for another world.

00:25:55.160 --> 00:25:56.910 align:middle line:84%
And they put their
arms around on another.

00:25:56.910 --> 00:25:59.070 align:middle line:84%
The guys said, we're
in a band together,

00:25:59.070 --> 00:26:00.420 align:middle line:90%
we play soccer together.

00:26:00.420 --> 00:26:00.810 align:middle line:90%
>>LIPTON: Yes.

00:26:00.810 --> 00:26:02.393 align:middle line:84%
>>GREGG: The girls--
we went to a park

00:26:02.393 --> 00:26:05.295 align:middle line:84%
and there were probably 12,
15 Palestinian, Christian,

00:26:05.295 --> 00:26:07.850 align:middle line:84%
and Israeli girls
drumming and dancing.

00:26:07.850 --> 00:26:09.600 align:middle line:84%
And when our group
went over to join them,

00:26:09.600 --> 00:26:12.000 align:middle line:84%
they were thrilled
for us to do that.

00:26:12.000 --> 00:26:14.970 align:middle line:84%
So what they're saying
to us is that we're

00:26:14.970 --> 00:26:16.290 align:middle line:90%
ready for a new world.

00:26:16.290 --> 00:26:20.460 align:middle line:84%
While we're not denying
the past, it is the past

00:26:20.460 --> 00:26:23.160 align:middle line:84%
and we're going to move
from this point forward.

00:26:23.160 --> 00:26:26.970 align:middle line:84%
And they're asking for tools
to help them to do that.

00:26:26.970 --> 00:26:31.980 align:middle line:84%
And I think, for me, one of the
most efficient places, maybe,

00:26:31.980 --> 00:26:34.895 align:middle line:84%
we can put our energy is with
young people who are now--

00:26:34.895 --> 00:26:36.270 align:middle line:84%
I mean, what would
the world look

00:26:36.270 --> 00:26:39.390 align:middle line:84%
like with a group
of young people,

00:26:39.390 --> 00:26:42.930 align:middle line:84%
educated to understand that
nature is based on cooperation

00:26:42.930 --> 00:26:45.490 align:middle line:84%
and not competition, that
nature is their friend,

00:26:45.490 --> 00:26:47.490 align:middle line:84%
and that they're a part
of, rather than separate

00:26:47.490 --> 00:26:51.810 align:middle line:84%
from the world and empowered,
empowered, to self regulate

00:26:51.810 --> 00:26:52.640 align:middle line:90%
their own bodies?

00:26:52.640 --> 00:26:55.598 align:middle line:84%
I mean, what a very, very
different world we would have.

00:26:55.598 --> 00:26:56.640 align:middle line:90%
>>LIPTON: I've seen this.

00:26:56.640 --> 00:26:58.200 align:middle line:84%
Because when I've
been in Israel,

00:26:58.200 --> 00:27:00.050 align:middle line:90%
I've visited a young couple.

00:27:00.050 --> 00:27:00.850 align:middle line:90%
They got married.

00:27:00.850 --> 00:27:04.862 align:middle line:84%
And she is an Israeli Jew
and he is Israeli Arab.

00:27:04.862 --> 00:27:05.820 align:middle line:90%
And he was programmed--

00:27:05.820 --> 00:27:06.620 align:middle line:90%
>>GREGG: Wow.

00:27:06.620 --> 00:27:08.340 align:middle line:84%
>>LIPTON: --as a
kid to hate Jews

00:27:08.340 --> 00:27:11.310 align:middle line:84%
and she was programmed
to be afraid of Arabs.

00:27:11.310 --> 00:27:13.770 align:middle line:84%
And they saw each other
in a Sinai desert,

00:27:13.770 --> 00:27:15.460 align:middle line:84%
as they were walking
toward each other.

00:27:15.460 --> 00:27:18.360 align:middle line:84%
They didn't even get to each
other and that thunderbolt hit.

00:27:18.360 --> 00:27:20.070 align:middle line:84%
And within three
days, they got married

00:27:20.070 --> 00:27:22.333 align:middle line:84%
and then they had a
couple of young boys.

00:27:22.333 --> 00:27:24.750 align:middle line:84%
And it was time to go to school,
and that was the problem.

00:27:24.750 --> 00:27:27.125 align:middle line:84%
They said, where are we going
to send the kids to school?

00:27:27.125 --> 00:27:29.565 align:middle line:84%
So they went and looked
at the Jewish school.

00:27:29.565 --> 00:27:31.440 align:middle line:84%
Then they went and looked
at the Arab school.

00:27:31.440 --> 00:27:32.980 align:middle line:84%
And then they went and looked
at the Christian school.

00:27:32.980 --> 00:27:34.590 align:middle line:84%
And they came home
and they cried.

00:27:34.590 --> 00:27:36.690 align:middle line:84%
They said, we can't send
our kids to any of these

00:27:36.690 --> 00:27:39.600 align:middle line:84%
because each one was
polarizing the students

00:27:39.600 --> 00:27:41.230 align:middle line:84%
against the other
groups in each one.

00:27:41.230 --> 00:27:42.000 align:middle line:84%
>>GREGG: Yeah, demonizing
the other groups.

00:27:42.000 --> 00:27:43.230 align:middle line:90%
>>LIPTON: The actual-- more so--

00:27:43.230 --> 00:27:44.030 align:middle line:90%
yeah.

00:27:44.030 --> 00:27:47.490 align:middle line:84%
And so they created something
called the Orchard of Abraham.

00:27:47.490 --> 00:27:49.500 align:middle line:10%
And what it has,
it's a kindergarten

00:27:49.500 --> 00:27:53.430 align:middle line:10%
that brings Jewish and Arab
kids in the kindergarten thing.

00:27:53.430 --> 00:27:55.710 align:middle line:84%
Now, when you see these
kids playing together,

00:27:55.710 --> 00:27:58.560 align:middle line:84%
they have no vision of
animosity, no hatred

00:27:58.560 --> 00:27:59.440 align:middle line:90%
and all that.

00:27:59.440 --> 00:28:02.065 align:middle line:10%
And as you mentioned, when they
start working together, playing

00:28:02.065 --> 00:28:04.830 align:middle line:10%
together, and all that, it's
much harder to pull them

00:28:04.830 --> 00:28:06.510 align:middle line:10%
apart later and
say, hey, we've been

00:28:06.510 --> 00:28:08.700 align:middle line:10%
friends for so many
years now, I hate you.

00:28:08.700 --> 00:28:10.570 align:middle line:90%
That's not likely to happen.

00:28:10.570 --> 00:28:13.200 align:middle line:84%
And so when we start
with the young people,

00:28:13.200 --> 00:28:15.858 align:middle line:84%
and give them a chance to see
a world in a very different way

00:28:15.858 --> 00:28:17.400 align:middle line:84%
than we've been
programmed to see it,

00:28:17.400 --> 00:28:19.770 align:middle line:84%
they can grow up with a
different set of rules.

00:28:19.770 --> 00:28:23.850 align:middle line:84%
And the unfortunate part is that
in developmental programming,

00:28:23.850 --> 00:28:27.150 align:middle line:84%
a parent, the way
they were raised, used

00:28:27.150 --> 00:28:30.810 align:middle line:84%
that own programming, from
being raised as a family,

00:28:30.810 --> 00:28:32.260 align:middle line:90%
to raise their own family.

00:28:32.260 --> 00:28:35.502 align:middle line:84%
So they propagate the beliefs
from generation to generation

00:28:35.502 --> 00:28:37.710 align:middle line:84%
to generation, even without
knowing they're doing it.

00:28:37.710 --> 00:28:39.930 align:middle line:84%
Because it's a
subconscious behavior.

00:28:39.930 --> 00:28:43.050 align:middle line:84%
And the reality is there's a
point where we have to stop

00:28:43.050 --> 00:28:46.230 align:middle line:84%
and say we cannot keep
passing the old story,

00:28:46.230 --> 00:28:48.480 align:middle line:84%
because that's the thing
that prevents us from moving

00:28:48.480 --> 00:28:50.320 align:middle line:84%
into the future, as
you just mentioned.

00:28:50.320 --> 00:28:53.370 align:middle line:90%
So education is important.

00:28:53.370 --> 00:28:55.170 align:middle line:84%
And as these kids
begin to grow up,

00:28:55.170 --> 00:28:57.833 align:middle line:84%
and they grow up being friends,
there's not a likely one day

00:28:57.833 --> 00:29:00.000 align:middle line:84%
that they'll look at each
other and say, oh, my god,

00:29:00.000 --> 00:29:01.300 align:middle line:90%
you're my enemy.

00:29:01.300 --> 00:29:02.500 align:middle line:90%
It will never happen.

00:29:02.500 --> 00:29:08.000 align:middle line:84%
So we can stop a hundred,
200 years of this conflict.

00:29:08.000 --> 00:29:09.080 align:middle line:90%
>>GREGG: 3,000 years.

00:29:09.080 --> 00:29:10.170 align:middle line:90%
>>LIPTON: 3,000.

00:29:10.170 --> 00:29:14.377 align:middle line:10%
And get the children to start
to recognize we're all--

00:29:14.377 --> 00:29:16.710 align:middle line:10%
actually, the name of the
program that I'm involved with

00:29:16.710 --> 00:29:19.470 align:middle line:10%
is called Human
First, humans first.

00:29:19.470 --> 00:29:23.190 align:middle line:10%
We're first humans, then
they put all the programs on.

00:29:23.190 --> 00:29:27.220 align:middle line:84%
If we emphasize human first,
then it shows no separation.

00:29:27.220 --> 00:29:29.640 align:middle line:84%
And my understanding
of evolution

00:29:29.640 --> 00:29:32.820 align:middle line:84%
is there is a phase where
the individual is important,

00:29:32.820 --> 00:29:34.190 align:middle line:90%
to make the smartest individual.

00:29:34.190 --> 00:29:36.270 align:middle line:84%
But once you get the
smartest individual,

00:29:36.270 --> 00:29:39.250 align:middle line:84%
you can't make them any smarter
biologically, physically,

00:29:39.250 --> 00:29:40.085 align:middle line:90%
mechanically.

00:29:40.085 --> 00:29:41.710 align:middle line:84%
And I said, well,
then evolution ended.

00:29:41.710 --> 00:29:42.620 align:middle line:90%
And I say, yeah, it did.

00:29:42.620 --> 00:29:44.140 align:middle line:84%
But then the next
level of evolution

00:29:44.140 --> 00:29:46.600 align:middle line:84%
was to take the individuals,
bring them together

00:29:46.600 --> 00:29:49.510 align:middle line:84%
in a community, and create
something different.

00:29:49.510 --> 00:29:52.210 align:middle line:84%
And this is exactly
where we are right now,

00:29:52.210 --> 00:29:55.030 align:middle line:84%
is taking the
individuals and saying,

00:29:55.030 --> 00:29:57.160 align:middle line:84%
wait, we're all part
of the same community,

00:29:57.160 --> 00:29:58.220 align:middle line:90%
and bring them together.

00:29:58.220 --> 00:30:00.870 align:middle line:84%
So our evolution is
watching what the breakdown

00:30:00.870 --> 00:30:02.830 align:middle line:90%
of barriers and borders and--

00:30:02.830 --> 00:30:04.900 align:middle line:90%
because the internet was global.

00:30:04.900 --> 00:30:07.510 align:middle line:84%
And all of a sudden,
it says people in Iran

00:30:07.510 --> 00:30:09.122 align:middle line:90%
could talk to people in Detroit.

00:30:09.122 --> 00:30:11.080 align:middle line:84%
And all of a sudden, they
started communicating

00:30:11.080 --> 00:30:12.230 align:middle line:90%
across global lines.

00:30:12.230 --> 00:30:13.360 align:middle line:90%
What was the point?

00:30:13.360 --> 00:30:16.840 align:middle line:84%
The barriers, the
separations, the programming

00:30:16.840 --> 00:30:20.020 align:middle line:84%
disappeared when there
was a dialogue that

00:30:20.020 --> 00:30:22.430 align:middle line:84%
was capable of being
carried out across the globe

00:30:22.430 --> 00:30:23.230 align:middle line:90%
at the same time.

00:30:23.230 --> 00:30:25.720 align:middle line:84%
>>GREGG: You're answering
my last question here.

00:30:25.720 --> 00:30:27.400 align:middle line:10%
You've written a book called,
"The Honeymoon Effect."

00:30:27.400 --> 00:30:28.200 align:middle line:90%
>>LIPTON: Yes.

00:30:28.200 --> 00:30:30.490 align:middle line:84%
>>GREGG: And if we were
to see that honeymoon

00:30:30.490 --> 00:30:33.558 align:middle line:84%
effect in our world, what
would the world look like?

00:30:33.558 --> 00:30:35.850 align:middle line:84%
And I'll tell you the reason
I think this is important.

00:30:35.850 --> 00:30:37.900 align:middle line:84%
It's because it's one
thing to talk about change

00:30:37.900 --> 00:30:39.483 align:middle line:84%
and what the world
can be, but to have

00:30:39.483 --> 00:30:45.130 align:middle line:84%
that change we need an image
to cling onto, to grasp,

00:30:45.130 --> 00:30:46.240 align:middle line:90%
of what is possible.

00:30:46.240 --> 00:30:47.842 align:middle line:84%
Rather than saying
we want change,

00:30:47.842 --> 00:30:49.550 align:middle line:84%
what do we want that
change to look like?

00:30:49.550 --> 00:30:51.340 align:middle line:84%
So if the world reflected
the honeymoon effect,

00:30:51.340 --> 00:30:52.310 align:middle line:90%
what would that look like?

00:30:52.310 --> 00:30:54.268 align:middle line:84%
>>LIPTON: Well, I say,
look, an average person,

00:30:54.268 --> 00:30:57.430 align:middle line:84%
before they met that special
person that blew their minds,

00:30:57.430 --> 00:30:58.870 align:middle line:90%
they have a day to day life.

00:30:58.870 --> 00:31:00.703 align:middle line:84%
Oh, god, another day--
blah, blah, blah,

00:31:00.703 --> 00:31:02.120 align:middle line:84%
blah, blah-- every
day, every day.

00:31:02.120 --> 00:31:05.170 align:middle line:84%
And then they meet this person
that comes into their life.

00:31:05.170 --> 00:31:08.320 align:middle line:84%
And in 24 hours, their
blah, blah, blah world

00:31:08.320 --> 00:31:09.970 align:middle line:90%
goes to heaven on Earth.

00:31:09.970 --> 00:31:10.840 align:middle line:90%
They're so happy.

00:31:10.840 --> 00:31:11.830 align:middle line:90%
They're so overjoyed.

00:31:11.830 --> 00:31:12.760 align:middle line:90%
The music's better.

00:31:12.760 --> 00:31:13.900 align:middle line:90%
The food's better.

00:31:13.900 --> 00:31:15.660 align:middle line:84%
Even a job that
wasn't that good,

00:31:15.660 --> 00:31:17.540 align:middle line:84%
all of a sudden that's
not a problem anymore.

00:31:17.540 --> 00:31:18.010 align:middle line:90%
And guess what?

00:31:18.010 --> 00:31:18.820 align:middle line:90%
They're happy.

00:31:18.820 --> 00:31:20.140 align:middle line:90%
They're in love.

00:31:20.140 --> 00:31:22.810 align:middle line:84%
And all of a sudden,
I said, oh, when

00:31:22.810 --> 00:31:26.080 align:middle line:84%
the love comes into
the equation, heaven

00:31:26.080 --> 00:31:27.700 align:middle line:90%
comes onto the planet.

00:31:27.700 --> 00:31:30.910 align:middle line:84%
And the relevance about that
is, so how did they do that--

00:31:30.910 --> 00:31:33.400 align:middle line:84%
have a whole life of blah,
blah, blah, and, in 24 hours,

00:31:33.400 --> 00:31:34.480 align:middle line:90%
go into heaven on Earth?

00:31:34.480 --> 00:31:37.390 align:middle line:84%
And the answer is because
we don't realize it,

00:31:37.390 --> 00:31:40.048 align:middle line:84%
but 95% of our behavior
is coming from programs

00:31:40.048 --> 00:31:41.965 align:middle line:84%
that we've gotten,
especially those downloaded

00:31:41.965 --> 00:31:43.570 align:middle line:90%
in the first seven years.

00:31:43.570 --> 00:31:45.250 align:middle line:84%
And the interesting
part is what happens

00:31:45.250 --> 00:31:46.292 align:middle line:90%
when people fall in love?

00:31:46.292 --> 00:31:48.250 align:middle line:84%
Well, science has
now recognized it's

00:31:48.250 --> 00:31:49.720 align:middle line:84%
the first time in
their life they

00:31:49.720 --> 00:31:53.590 align:middle line:84%
stop playing the programs
they got in their development

00:31:53.590 --> 00:31:56.560 align:middle line:84%
and started creating from
what their personal wishes

00:31:56.560 --> 00:31:57.500 align:middle line:90%
and desires were.

00:31:57.500 --> 00:31:58.300 align:middle line:90%
And guess what?

00:31:58.300 --> 00:32:00.730 align:middle line:84%
Everybody's personal
wishes and desires,

00:32:00.730 --> 00:32:03.190 align:middle line:84%
as opposed to their
program, are what?

00:32:03.190 --> 00:32:07.240 align:middle line:84%
Love, happiness, joy,
fun, and all these things.

00:32:07.240 --> 00:32:09.670 align:middle line:10%
So when people stop
playing the program,

00:32:09.670 --> 00:32:12.563 align:middle line:10%
they start creating this version
called the honeymoon, which

00:32:12.563 --> 00:32:14.980 align:middle line:10%
all of a sudden is the most
enjoyable part of their lives.

00:32:14.980 --> 00:32:16.990 align:middle line:84%
And scientists recognize,
well, how did you do that

00:32:16.990 --> 00:32:18.460 align:middle line:84%
and how did you
do it in 24 hours?

00:32:18.460 --> 00:32:22.300 align:middle line:84%
And the answer was stop playing
the developmental program

00:32:22.300 --> 00:32:24.700 align:middle line:84%
that was downloaded into
us, especially when we

00:32:24.700 --> 00:32:25.690 align:middle line:90%
were children.

00:32:25.690 --> 00:32:28.720 align:middle line:84%
And the moment we stopped
playing that, the individual's

00:32:28.720 --> 00:32:30.880 align:middle line:90%
wishes and desires manifest.

00:32:30.880 --> 00:32:33.310 align:middle line:84%
And all of a sudden, the world
turns into heaven on Earth.

00:32:33.310 --> 00:32:35.680 align:middle line:84%
And this is what I actually
believe from my science,

00:32:35.680 --> 00:32:38.685 align:middle line:84%
that that's not just
a figure of speech.

00:32:38.685 --> 00:32:40.560 align:middle line:84%
People think, well, you
die and go to heaven.

00:32:40.560 --> 00:32:42.770 align:middle line:84%
And I go, I actually think
it's the other way around.

00:32:42.770 --> 00:32:44.295 align:middle line:90%
I think we're born into heaven.

00:32:44.295 --> 00:32:45.170 align:middle line:90%
>>GREGG: I love that.

00:32:45.170 --> 00:32:47.290 align:middle line:84%
>>LIPTON: Because this is
where we came to create.

00:32:47.290 --> 00:32:48.430 align:middle line:84%
And then you look
at the creation,

00:32:48.430 --> 00:32:50.140 align:middle line:84%
I go, well, it doesn't
look really good right now.

00:32:50.140 --> 00:32:51.890 align:middle line:84%
And I go, yeah, because
we're not creating

00:32:51.890 --> 00:32:53.400 align:middle line:90%
from our wishes and desires.

00:32:53.400 --> 00:32:55.600 align:middle line:84%
We are creating
from the programs.

00:32:55.600 --> 00:32:58.570 align:middle line:84%
And as the honeymoon
effect reveals,

00:32:58.570 --> 00:33:01.263 align:middle line:84%
the moment you stop
playing the program

00:33:01.263 --> 00:33:03.430 align:middle line:84%
and you start living from
wishes and desires, that's

00:33:03.430 --> 00:33:04.850 align:middle line:90%
the manifestation.

00:33:04.850 --> 00:33:07.820 align:middle line:90%
So the message is very clear.

00:33:07.820 --> 00:33:10.870 align:middle line:84%
It's the program that
has taken us away.

00:33:10.870 --> 00:33:14.290 align:middle line:84%
And it's the stopping of
the program that changes

00:33:14.290 --> 00:33:15.770 align:middle line:90%
the world into heaven on Earth.

00:33:15.770 --> 00:33:17.353 align:middle line:84%
>>GREGG: I think
this is so important.

00:33:17.353 --> 00:33:21.970 align:middle line:10%
You've given us a very real,
accessible, non-technical way

00:33:21.970 --> 00:33:24.400 align:middle line:10%
of mirroring in our
lives what the science is

00:33:24.400 --> 00:33:25.930 align:middle line:10%
telling us to be true.

00:33:25.930 --> 00:33:29.590 align:middle line:84%
So Bruce, I look
forward to you and I

00:33:29.590 --> 00:33:33.490 align:middle line:84%
seeing, in the world, the fruits
of the labor and the wisdom

00:33:33.490 --> 00:33:36.190 align:middle line:84%
from the knowledge that has
been revealed in our lifetimes,

00:33:36.190 --> 00:33:38.680 align:middle line:84%
that you and I have worked
almost our entire lifetimes

00:33:38.680 --> 00:33:40.010 align:middle line:90%
to share with the world.

00:33:40.010 --> 00:33:41.967 align:middle line:84%
I want to thank you for
being with us today.

00:33:41.967 --> 00:33:43.175 align:middle line:90%
>>LIPTON: I so appreciate it.

00:33:43.175 --> 00:33:46.180 align:middle line:84%
And I also want to
say, the joy, for me,

00:33:46.180 --> 00:33:48.100 align:middle line:84%
looking at an individual
such as yourself

00:33:48.100 --> 00:33:50.290 align:middle line:84%
and working in harmony
with someone who is working

00:33:50.290 --> 00:33:51.543 align:middle line:90%
from that point is like--

00:33:51.543 --> 00:33:52.960 align:middle line:84%
it is a completely
different world

00:33:52.960 --> 00:33:55.300 align:middle line:84%
than when I was working
in the scientific lab.

00:33:55.300 --> 00:33:57.340 align:middle line:10%
Because I start to realize
that-- because we're

00:33:57.340 --> 00:34:00.160 align:middle line:10%
creating as conscious
individuals,

00:34:00.160 --> 00:34:02.802 align:middle line:10%
as quantum physics reveals
our consciousness creating,

00:34:02.802 --> 00:34:04.510 align:middle line:10%
when we clear our
consciousness, then all

00:34:04.510 --> 00:34:08.889 align:middle line:10%
of a sudden the joy and the
love of the planet manifest.

00:34:08.889 --> 00:34:11.907 align:middle line:84%
And so I want to thank you
for revealing that to me

00:34:11.907 --> 00:34:13.449 align:middle line:84%
so I can work with
you on that level.

00:34:13.449 --> 00:34:14.800 align:middle line:84%
>>GREGG: It's the
new human story.

00:34:14.800 --> 00:34:15.633 align:middle line:90%
>>LIPTON: Thank you.

00:34:15.633 --> 00:34:18.990 align:middle line:90%
