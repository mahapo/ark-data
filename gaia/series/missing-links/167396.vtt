>>GREGG BRADEN: Hello,
my name is Gregg Braden.

00:00:27.820 --> 00:00:30.361 align:middle line:10%
And I'd like to welcome you to
this very special presentation

00:00:30.361 --> 00:00:33.940 align:middle line:10%
of "Missing Links,"
Simulation by Design,

00:00:33.940 --> 00:00:36.890 align:middle line:10%
Are We Living in
a Virtual Reality?

00:00:36.890 --> 00:00:38.950 align:middle line:84%
Well, in the last episode
of "Missing Links,"

00:00:38.950 --> 00:00:41.500 align:middle line:84%
we asked the question,
is it possible

00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:45.738 align:middle line:84%
that we're living in
a simulated reality?

00:00:45.738 --> 00:00:49.040 align:middle line:10%
In 2001, a scientist
at Oxford University

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:51.830 align:middle line:10%
began the first
scientific investigation

00:00:51.830 --> 00:00:55.280 align:middle line:10%
designed to find an answer
to precisely this question.

00:00:55.280 --> 00:00:57.590 align:middle line:10%
So in this "Missing
Links" episode,

00:00:57.590 --> 00:01:01.550 align:middle line:10%
I'll share the results of that
investigation and the discovery

00:01:01.550 --> 00:01:03.650 align:middle line:10%
that has now opened
the floodgates

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:06.680 align:middle line:10%
to serious scientific
consideration of us

00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:09.920 align:middle line:10%
living inside of an
ancient simulation.

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:11.870 align:middle line:84%
The study itself is
going to intrigue you.

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:13.760 align:middle line:84%
The results are
going to astound you.

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:15.590 align:middle line:90%
Here's what I mean.

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:20.120 align:middle line:84%
In 2001, a professor at
England's Oxford University

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:23.030 align:middle line:84%
formalized the question
as to whether or not

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:27.110 align:middle line:84%
we are living in an ancient
computerized simulation.

00:01:27.110 --> 00:01:29.690 align:middle line:84%
And he did it through a
paper that he published.

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:32.840 align:middle line:10%
And the paper was actually
entitled, "Are You Living

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:35.120 align:middle line:10%
in a Computer Simulation?"

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:37.940 align:middle line:90%
The paper itself is complex.

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:40.940 align:middle line:84%
And it identifies
three possibilities,

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:45.980 align:middle line:84%
three possible scenarios, that
may be unfolding in our lives

00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:48.850 align:middle line:90%
right now and in our future.

00:01:48.850 --> 00:01:52.910 align:middle line:84%
And using a process of a
very complex algorithm,

00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:56.090 align:middle line:84%
with many variables that
represent the real world

00:01:56.090 --> 00:02:00.080 align:middle line:84%
as we know it today, he
concluded that at least one

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:03.950 align:middle line:84%
of these scenarios is
actually happening right now.

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:05.650 align:middle line:84%
Let's take a look
at this process.

00:02:05.650 --> 00:02:08.630 align:middle line:84%
And I'm going to spend a
little bit of time developing

00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:11.210 align:middle line:84%
this idea, because the
rest of this series

00:02:11.210 --> 00:02:14.010 align:middle line:84%
is based upon what
we're doing right now.

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:15.680 align:middle line:84%
So it's important
that we understand

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:20.120 align:middle line:84%
precisely what this
algorithm is telling us,

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:22.940 align:middle line:84%
what the calculations
are telling us,

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:26.210 align:middle line:84%
and what the conclusions
for the study

00:02:26.210 --> 00:02:29.040 align:middle line:84%
are really showing us
about our world today.

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:31.370 align:middle line:84%
But before we get
to the paper itself,

00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:33.860 align:middle line:84%
there's a term that
I need to define.

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:40.460 align:middle line:84%
The term is posthuman, a
posthuman civilization.

00:02:40.460 --> 00:02:43.550 align:middle line:84%
It's a term that Bostrom
uses throughout his paper,

00:02:43.550 --> 00:02:45.180 align:middle line:90%
throughout the algorithm.

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:46.790 align:middle line:84%
And we're going to
refer to this term

00:02:46.790 --> 00:02:48.380 align:middle line:84%
throughout the rest
of this series,

00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:50.870 align:middle line:84%
so it's important that we
get it right right now.

00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:55.490 align:middle line:84%
Bostrom defines posthuman
as an advanced civilization,

00:02:55.490 --> 00:03:00.500 align:middle line:84%
like ours, that has transcended
the great challenges that we

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:02.420 align:middle line:90%
face in our world today.

00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:05.660 align:middle line:84%
Not only survived, but
they have transcended.

00:03:05.660 --> 00:03:07.790 align:middle line:84%
They've learned a way
of living and a way

00:03:07.790 --> 00:03:11.210 align:middle line:84%
of being where the
challenges, such as climate

00:03:11.210 --> 00:03:15.920 align:middle line:84%
change, such as nuclear war,
such as pandemic disease,

00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:19.320 align:middle line:84%
are no longer a threat
to their society.

00:03:19.320 --> 00:03:23.570 align:middle line:84%
So clearly, we have not yet
reached this posthuman stage.

00:03:23.570 --> 00:03:26.420 align:middle line:84%
And this is what's important
in the algorithms and the paper

00:03:26.420 --> 00:03:28.820 align:middle line:84%
that we're going to
develop, because one

00:03:28.820 --> 00:03:32.060 align:middle line:84%
of the possibilities
is that we do, in fact,

00:03:32.060 --> 00:03:34.670 align:middle line:90%
reach this posthuman stage.

00:03:34.670 --> 00:03:39.110 align:middle line:84%
So let's take a look at the
three possible scenarios.

00:03:39.110 --> 00:03:41.990 align:middle line:84%
And then let's run through
the algorithm itself

00:03:41.990 --> 00:03:46.040 align:middle line:84%
that explores and gives
weight and value to each one,

00:03:46.040 --> 00:03:48.110 align:middle line:84%
and see which one
of these scenarios

00:03:48.110 --> 00:03:52.010 align:middle line:84%
is most likely
true for us today.

00:03:52.010 --> 00:03:55.190 align:middle line:84%
The first possibility
that Bostrom defines

00:03:55.190 --> 00:04:01.010 align:middle line:84%
is that advanced civilizations
become extinct before they

00:04:01.010 --> 00:04:03.810 align:middle line:90%
reach the posthuman stage.

00:04:03.810 --> 00:04:08.990 align:middle line:84%
In other words, they succumb
to the crises of their time.

00:04:08.990 --> 00:04:11.480 align:middle line:84%
Maybe they don't survive
the climate change.

00:04:11.480 --> 00:04:13.400 align:middle line:84%
Maybe something
happens, and there's

00:04:13.400 --> 00:04:15.290 align:middle line:84%
a pandemic disease
that wipes out

00:04:15.290 --> 00:04:17.540 align:middle line:84%
all life on the
face of the Earth.

00:04:17.540 --> 00:04:18.740 align:middle line:90%
Maybe there's a solar flare.

00:04:18.740 --> 00:04:21.050 align:middle line:84%
Maybe an asteroid
hits the Earth.

00:04:21.050 --> 00:04:23.330 align:middle line:90%
Maybe there is a great war.

00:04:23.330 --> 00:04:25.280 align:middle line:84%
Many of these
ideas are precisely

00:04:25.280 --> 00:04:27.260 align:middle line:84%
the things that are
being played out

00:04:27.260 --> 00:04:30.040 align:middle line:84%
in the films and the movies
that are most popular today.

00:04:30.040 --> 00:04:33.140 align:middle line:84%
And I think it's interesting
that Bostrom has defined

00:04:33.140 --> 00:04:37.460 align:middle line:84%
this possibility as the
first one in the algorithm

00:04:37.460 --> 00:04:39.170 align:middle line:90%
that he is developing.

00:04:39.170 --> 00:04:43.850 align:middle line:84%
So this first scenario is that
advanced civilizations simply

00:04:43.850 --> 00:04:47.450 align:middle line:84%
go extinct before they solve
the problems of their time.

00:04:47.450 --> 00:04:50.770 align:middle line:90%


00:04:50.770 --> 00:04:53.620 align:middle line:84%
The second possibility
fascinates me,

00:04:53.620 --> 00:04:58.570 align:middle line:84%
because it suggests that
advanced civilizations do

00:04:58.570 --> 00:05:00.850 align:middle line:90%
reach the posthuman stage.

00:05:00.850 --> 00:05:03.310 align:middle line:84%
They do reach the
point where they

00:05:03.310 --> 00:05:05.830 align:middle line:84%
have transcended all of
the great challenges that

00:05:05.830 --> 00:05:07.810 align:middle line:90%
face us in the world today.

00:05:07.810 --> 00:05:11.680 align:middle line:84%
However, they become
a non-technologically

00:05:11.680 --> 00:05:13.400 align:middle line:90%
based society.

00:05:13.400 --> 00:05:16.450 align:middle line:84%
In other words, they go back
to living closer to the Earth.

00:05:16.450 --> 00:05:19.870 align:middle line:84%
They become more of an
agrarian society, where

00:05:19.870 --> 00:05:23.890 align:middle line:84%
life is based around growing
food, small populations,

00:05:23.890 --> 00:05:28.660 align:middle line:84%
localized living, so localized
economies, localized sources

00:05:28.660 --> 00:05:31.700 align:middle line:90%
of energy, local communities.

00:05:31.700 --> 00:05:34.030 align:middle line:84%
And this certainly is a
possibility for the future.

00:05:34.030 --> 00:05:38.920 align:middle line:84%
We may find eventually that
localized living serves

00:05:38.920 --> 00:05:42.250 align:middle line:84%
us better in a changing
world than large scale,

00:05:42.250 --> 00:05:45.610 align:middle line:84%
centralized types of
civilizations that

00:05:45.610 --> 00:05:47.470 align:middle line:84%
seem to have
developed in the past

00:05:47.470 --> 00:05:50.110 align:middle line:84%
and that we are actually
living in right now.

00:05:50.110 --> 00:05:54.310 align:middle line:84%
So this second possibility
that I find so fascinating

00:05:54.310 --> 00:05:58.750 align:middle line:84%
is that we do survive,
but we choose a very, very

00:05:58.750 --> 00:06:01.330 align:middle line:90%
different way of living.

00:06:01.330 --> 00:06:06.070 align:middle line:84%
The third possibility is
that advanced civilization

00:06:06.070 --> 00:06:08.480 align:middle line:90%
do reach the posthuman stage.

00:06:08.480 --> 00:06:12.160 align:middle line:84%
However, they continue
to develop along

00:06:12.160 --> 00:06:14.282 align:middle line:90%
a technological path.

00:06:14.282 --> 00:06:17.140 align:middle line:84%
So in other words,
advanced civilizations

00:06:17.140 --> 00:06:21.580 align:middle line:84%
learn to reconcile their
relationship to the Earth.

00:06:21.580 --> 00:06:25.490 align:middle line:84%
They learn to find balance
and harmony with nature.

00:06:25.490 --> 00:06:29.020 align:middle line:84%
They learn to find balance
and harmony with other humans.

00:06:29.020 --> 00:06:32.880 align:middle line:84%
In this civilization,
war becomes obsolete.

00:06:32.880 --> 00:06:34.780 align:middle line:84%
The advanced
civilizations learned

00:06:34.780 --> 00:06:36.579 align:middle line:90%
that no one wins in a war.

00:06:36.579 --> 00:06:38.870 align:middle line:84%
The idea of a war is that
there are winners and losers.

00:06:38.870 --> 00:06:41.380 align:middle line:84%
The kinds of wars
that become possible

00:06:41.380 --> 00:06:44.230 align:middle line:84%
through advanced
technology, everyone loses.

00:06:44.230 --> 00:06:49.120 align:middle line:84%
So in this third scenario,
advanced civilizations

00:06:49.120 --> 00:06:53.920 align:middle line:84%
reach the posthuman stage,
transcend the great challenges

00:06:53.920 --> 00:06:57.100 align:middle line:84%
that we face in our
world today, and they

00:06:57.100 --> 00:07:01.280 align:middle line:84%
continue to develop as
a technological society.

00:07:01.280 --> 00:07:04.090 align:middle line:84%
This means they continue
to build computers

00:07:04.090 --> 00:07:07.630 align:middle line:84%
with even more advanced
capabilities based

00:07:07.630 --> 00:07:11.500 align:middle line:84%
upon principles that we're only
beginning to understand today--

00:07:11.500 --> 00:07:15.280 align:middle line:84%
quantum computing, for
example, where memory

00:07:15.280 --> 00:07:18.970 align:middle line:84%
of the computer and the
capacity is actually stored

00:07:18.970 --> 00:07:21.400 align:middle line:90%
beyond the machine itself.

00:07:21.400 --> 00:07:24.400 align:middle line:84%
The memory is not confined
to the circuits or a chip.

00:07:24.400 --> 00:07:27.010 align:middle line:84%
It is stored in a
field of energy that is

00:07:27.010 --> 00:07:29.670 align:middle line:90%
larger than the machine itself.

00:07:29.670 --> 00:07:32.050 align:middle line:84%
So what Bostrom is
saying in the paper

00:07:32.050 --> 00:07:35.220 align:middle line:84%
is that these are the three
scenarios that are possible.

00:07:35.220 --> 00:07:38.130 align:middle line:90%
One of these three must be true.

00:07:38.130 --> 00:07:41.420 align:middle line:84%
And now, he's going to use a
very sophisticated algorithm,

00:07:41.420 --> 00:07:43.450 align:middle line:84%
and I'm going to share
this with you, that

00:07:43.450 --> 00:07:47.380 align:middle line:84%
will help him to know
which of those three

00:07:47.380 --> 00:07:50.800 align:middle line:84%
is most likely for us right
now in our lives today.

00:07:50.800 --> 00:07:54.230 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:07:54.230 --> 00:07:59.620 align:middle line:90%


00:07:59.620 --> 00:08:04.470 align:middle line:84%
So the core of the simulation
argument that Bostrom uses--

00:08:04.470 --> 00:08:06.550 align:middle line:90%
it's a complex calculation.

00:08:06.550 --> 00:08:08.890 align:middle line:84%
And it uses a
series of variables

00:08:08.890 --> 00:08:11.890 align:middle line:84%
that represent each of
the three possibilities

00:08:11.890 --> 00:08:15.670 align:middle line:84%
that I've just shared with
you and all of the parameters

00:08:15.670 --> 00:08:19.840 align:middle line:84%
that go into making
those variables possible.

00:08:19.840 --> 00:08:23.320 align:middle line:84%
So let me just identify
the variables first.

00:08:23.320 --> 00:08:26.860 align:middle line:84%
On your screen,
you're seeing an fp.

00:08:26.860 --> 00:08:30.100 align:middle line:84%
That is the fraction
of civilizations

00:08:30.100 --> 00:08:33.429 align:middle line:90%
that survives to posthuman.

00:08:33.429 --> 00:08:37.840 align:middle line:84%
Now, when Bostrom is
creating these calculations,

00:08:37.840 --> 00:08:41.289 align:middle line:84%
he's talking about
civilizations in general,

00:08:41.289 --> 00:08:43.929 align:middle line:84%
not specifically ours,
any civilizations.

00:08:43.929 --> 00:08:47.620 align:middle line:84%
He hasn't even really talked
about where they are located.

00:08:47.620 --> 00:08:51.870 align:middle line:84%
He's just saying, in general,
advanced civilizations

00:08:51.870 --> 00:08:54.670 align:middle line:84%
will follow one of these
three possibilities.

00:08:54.670 --> 00:08:59.530 align:middle line:84%
And fp is representing the
fraction of civilizations

00:08:59.530 --> 00:09:01.690 align:middle line:90%
that survive to posthuman.

00:09:01.690 --> 00:09:02.800 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:09:02.800 --> 00:09:06.070 align:middle line:84%
The second variable
is a bar N, N

00:09:06.070 --> 00:09:07.360 align:middle line:90%
with a bar over the top of it.

00:09:07.360 --> 00:09:12.640 align:middle line:84%
It is the average number of
simulations run by a posthuman

00:09:12.640 --> 00:09:14.080 align:middle line:90%
civilization.

00:09:14.080 --> 00:09:17.140 align:middle line:84%
So what he's saying here is
that if there is a posthuman

00:09:17.140 --> 00:09:20.030 align:middle line:84%
civilization, that they
have reached that point,

00:09:20.030 --> 00:09:23.770 align:middle line:84%
they are technological, they
are running these simulations,

00:09:23.770 --> 00:09:25.810 align:middle line:84%
how many of the simulations
are they running?

00:09:25.810 --> 00:09:28.145 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:09:28.145 --> 00:09:32.350 align:middle line:90%


00:09:32.350 --> 00:09:36.110 align:middle line:84%
The third variable is bar
H. Capital H with a bar

00:09:36.110 --> 00:09:40.970 align:middle line:84%
over the top is the average
number of individuals

00:09:40.970 --> 00:09:43.550 align:middle line:84%
that have lived
in a civilization

00:09:43.550 --> 00:09:45.580 align:middle line:90%
before it reaches posthuman.

00:09:45.580 --> 00:09:48.690 align:middle line:90%


00:09:48.690 --> 00:09:52.500 align:middle line:10%
So these three variables are all
brought together in a formula

00:09:52.500 --> 00:09:55.180 align:middle line:10%
that you're seeing on
the screen right now.

00:09:55.180 --> 00:09:57.270 align:middle line:84%
This is the formula
that represents

00:09:57.270 --> 00:09:59.310 align:middle line:90%
the algorithm of thinking.

00:09:59.310 --> 00:10:03.360 align:middle line:10%
We're calculating
what possibilities

00:10:03.360 --> 00:10:07.360 align:middle line:10%
are probable for us
in our lifetime today.

00:10:07.360 --> 00:10:08.160 align:middle line:90%
All right.

00:10:08.160 --> 00:10:11.400 align:middle line:84%
And as the variables begin
to shift, what we see

00:10:11.400 --> 00:10:13.500 align:middle line:84%
is that some of
the possibilities

00:10:13.500 --> 00:10:15.490 align:middle line:90%
become more likely than others.

00:10:15.490 --> 00:10:19.350 align:middle line:10%
So the f sim that you see
on the left hand side,

00:10:19.350 --> 00:10:21.840 align:middle line:10%
this is the number
of civilizations that

00:10:21.840 --> 00:10:24.570 align:middle line:10%
match the criteria that
are being developed

00:10:24.570 --> 00:10:27.720 align:middle line:10%
by the mathematic
algorithm on the right.

00:10:27.720 --> 00:10:31.950 align:middle line:84%
So the thinking that
underlies this argument

00:10:31.950 --> 00:10:37.980 align:middle line:84%
is that a technologically
mature posthuman civilization--

00:10:37.980 --> 00:10:42.070 align:middle line:84%
number one, it would have
enormous computing power.

00:10:42.070 --> 00:10:44.870 align:middle line:84%
And this is why I made the point
in the first episode of this

00:10:44.870 --> 00:10:49.980 align:middle line:84%
series that after only 60
to 70 years of developing

00:10:49.980 --> 00:10:52.680 align:middle line:84%
the computer technology
that we have today,

00:10:52.680 --> 00:10:57.300 align:middle line:84%
we are creating simulations that
are so real that we cannot tell

00:10:57.300 --> 00:11:02.950 align:middle line:84%
them from the real thing unless
we know it's a simulation.

00:11:02.950 --> 00:11:06.090 align:middle line:84%
So this argument,
the underlying theme,

00:11:06.090 --> 00:11:09.990 align:middle line:84%
is that a mature posthuman
civilization that

00:11:09.990 --> 00:11:12.420 align:middle line:84%
has continued along
a technological path

00:11:12.420 --> 00:11:17.070 align:middle line:84%
is going to have awesome,
enormous computing power, where

00:11:17.070 --> 00:11:19.710 align:middle line:84%
bar N, the capital
N with a bar over it

00:11:19.710 --> 00:11:23.460 align:middle line:84%
is going to be very
large in the algorithm.

00:11:23.460 --> 00:11:28.030 align:middle line:84%
The calculations are
revealing three possibilities.

00:11:28.030 --> 00:11:33.470 align:middle line:84%
And each one has a value
between zero and one.

00:11:33.470 --> 00:11:36.430 align:middle line:84%
So the closer the
value is to one,

00:11:36.430 --> 00:11:40.240 align:middle line:84%
the greater the possibility
is that it is true.

00:11:40.240 --> 00:11:43.120 align:middle line:84%
Closer it is the zero,
the less that possibility.

00:11:43.120 --> 00:11:45.820 align:middle line:84%
Intuitively, that's
what we can say.

00:11:45.820 --> 00:11:48.580 align:middle line:84%
So let's take a look at
these three possibilities.

00:11:48.580 --> 00:11:53.320 align:middle line:84%
First possibility is that
the fraction of human level

00:11:53.320 --> 00:11:57.670 align:middle line:84%
civilizations that reach
a posthuman stage that

00:11:57.670 --> 00:12:01.270 align:middle line:84%
survive all of the
crises that we see today,

00:12:01.270 --> 00:12:04.740 align:middle line:84%
and maybe some that we
haven't even witnessed yet,

00:12:04.740 --> 00:12:08.350 align:middle line:84%
the possibility is
very close to zero.

00:12:08.350 --> 00:12:09.330 align:middle line:90%
All right.

00:12:09.330 --> 00:12:12.610 align:middle line:84%
The second possibility
is that the fraction

00:12:12.610 --> 00:12:15.130 align:middle line:84%
of posthuman
civilizations that are

00:12:15.130 --> 00:12:18.610 align:middle line:84%
even interested in
running civilizations

00:12:18.610 --> 00:12:20.680 align:middle line:90%
is very close to zero.

00:12:20.680 --> 00:12:25.360 align:middle line:84%
So this is aligned with the
agrarian type of society

00:12:25.360 --> 00:12:27.280 align:middle line:90%
that we mentioned earlier--

00:12:27.280 --> 00:12:30.220 align:middle line:84%
the fraction of
posthuman civilizations

00:12:30.220 --> 00:12:32.830 align:middle line:84%
that survive the
challenges, but they choose

00:12:32.830 --> 00:12:35.510 align:middle line:90%
a different way of living.

00:12:35.510 --> 00:12:38.600 align:middle line:84%
The third possibility
is that the fraction

00:12:38.600 --> 00:12:43.670 align:middle line:84%
of all people with our
kind of experience,

00:12:43.670 --> 00:12:46.970 align:middle line:84%
our kind of history,
our kind of knowledge,

00:12:46.970 --> 00:12:52.130 align:middle line:84%
what we know today, that are
now living in a simulation

00:12:52.130 --> 00:12:54.480 align:middle line:90%
is very close to one.

00:12:54.480 --> 00:12:56.170 align:middle line:90%
Let me say this again.

00:12:56.170 --> 00:12:59.720 align:middle line:84%
It says the fraction of all
people who know what we now

00:12:59.720 --> 00:13:02.960 align:middle line:84%
know today, have experienced
what we have experienced

00:13:02.960 --> 00:13:05.540 align:middle line:90%
in our past, collectively--

00:13:05.540 --> 00:13:09.920 align:middle line:84%
that the fraction of those
that are now already living

00:13:09.920 --> 00:13:13.293 align:middle line:84%
in a simulation is
very close to one.

00:13:13.293 --> 00:13:14.810 align:middle line:90%
All right.

00:13:14.810 --> 00:13:20.040 align:middle line:84%
So with these three
probabilities in mind,

00:13:20.040 --> 00:13:22.310 align:middle line:84%
what we now know,
the algorithm seems

00:13:22.310 --> 00:13:24.680 align:middle line:90%
to favor the third possibility.

00:13:24.680 --> 00:13:27.730 align:middle line:10%
It's closer to one
than the other two are.

00:13:27.730 --> 00:13:30.590 align:middle line:84%
This says that advanced
civilizations survive

00:13:30.590 --> 00:13:34.880 align:middle line:84%
to posthuman, and they
continue to use these advanced

00:13:34.880 --> 00:13:38.400 align:middle line:84%
technological practices
that we are using today.

00:13:38.400 --> 00:13:42.380 align:middle line:84%
So if this is true,
what Bostrom says

00:13:42.380 --> 00:13:47.630 align:middle line:84%
is that we are almost certainly
living in a computer simulation

00:13:47.630 --> 00:13:48.920 align:middle line:90%
right now.

00:13:48.920 --> 00:13:50.630 align:middle line:90%
Let me say this again.

00:13:50.630 --> 00:13:55.100 align:middle line:84%
If number three is true, then
what Bostrom's calculations are

00:13:55.100 --> 00:13:57.950 align:middle line:84%
saying, what his
algorithm is suggesting,

00:13:57.950 --> 00:14:02.780 align:middle line:84%
is that we are already living
in a computer simulation

00:14:02.780 --> 00:14:04.160 align:middle line:90%
right now.

00:14:04.160 --> 00:14:05.960 align:middle line:90%
We have reached posthuman.

00:14:05.960 --> 00:14:08.810 align:middle line:84%
We continued a
technological path.

00:14:08.810 --> 00:14:11.360 align:middle line:84%
We continued to
build simulations,

00:14:11.360 --> 00:14:14.120 align:middle line:84%
and that we have created
a simulation for ourselves

00:14:14.120 --> 00:14:15.230 align:middle line:90%
right now.

00:14:15.230 --> 00:14:18.410 align:middle line:84%
Now, I'm not talking about who
or why or what the purpose.

00:14:18.410 --> 00:14:20.170 align:middle line:84%
That's where we're
going to go with this.

00:14:20.170 --> 00:14:25.880 align:middle line:10%
But I want you to see that
the scientific examination

00:14:25.880 --> 00:14:29.900 align:middle line:10%
of whether or not this
possibility could even be real

00:14:29.900 --> 00:14:32.960 align:middle line:10%
is telling us that it
is more likely than not

00:14:32.960 --> 00:14:37.300 align:middle line:10%
that you and I are living
in a simulated universe,

00:14:37.300 --> 00:14:40.457 align:middle line:10%
a simulated world, a
virtual reality, right now.

00:14:40.457 --> 00:14:42.290 align:middle line:10%
It suggests that we're
not even really here.

00:14:42.290 --> 00:14:43.577 align:middle line:90%
Our bodies are here.

00:14:43.577 --> 00:14:45.410 align:middle line:84%
And we're experiencing
through these bodies.

00:14:45.410 --> 00:14:47.330 align:middle line:84%
But as you're going
to see, it suggests

00:14:47.330 --> 00:14:50.120 align:middle line:84%
that we may actually be
projecting into these bodies

00:14:50.120 --> 00:14:51.500 align:middle line:90%
from somewhere else.

00:14:51.500 --> 00:14:55.010 align:middle line:84%
And the implications of that
are vast and powerful and

00:14:55.010 --> 00:14:55.850 align:middle line:90%
beautiful.

00:14:55.850 --> 00:14:58.310 align:middle line:84%
And I'm excited to
share them with you.

00:14:58.310 --> 00:15:00.530 align:middle line:84%
This idea, Bostrom's
conclusion--

00:15:00.530 --> 00:15:05.300 align:middle line:84%
he says, unless we're already
living inside of a simulation,

00:15:05.300 --> 00:15:09.080 align:middle line:84%
unless we're already here, he
says possibility one or two

00:15:09.080 --> 00:15:11.030 align:middle line:90%
has already happened.

00:15:11.030 --> 00:15:13.610 align:middle line:84%
Unless we're already
in the simulation,

00:15:13.610 --> 00:15:16.400 align:middle line:84%
either we didn't make it,
number one, or we did make it,

00:15:16.400 --> 00:15:19.970 align:middle line:84%
and we became agrarian
society, number two.

00:15:19.970 --> 00:15:23.990 align:middle line:84%
So the odds are greater than
not that we are actually

00:15:23.990 --> 00:15:25.780 align:middle line:90%
living in this simulation.

00:15:25.780 --> 00:15:27.920 align:middle line:84%
And I want you to know
this is more than just

00:15:27.920 --> 00:15:30.020 align:middle line:84%
a philosophical
question, because it

00:15:30.020 --> 00:15:34.710 align:middle line:84%
touches upon the deepest
aspects of our society,

00:15:34.710 --> 00:15:37.580 align:middle line:84%
of our belief system, of
the way we think about

00:15:37.580 --> 00:15:40.350 align:middle line:84%
our origin, our
relationship to the world,

00:15:40.350 --> 00:15:44.150 align:middle line:84%
our purpose, our function how
we think about one another.

00:15:44.150 --> 00:15:48.620 align:middle line:84%
And now that Bostrom has done
this groundbreaking work,

00:15:48.620 --> 00:15:50.810 align:middle line:84%
it's like the floodgates
have been opened.

00:15:50.810 --> 00:15:53.315 align:middle line:90%
And everybody is now piling in.

00:15:53.315 --> 00:15:55.310 align:middle line:84%
Some very, very
well-known scientists

00:15:55.310 --> 00:15:56.990 align:middle line:90%
are now agreeing with Bostrom.

00:15:56.990 --> 00:15:59.900 align:middle line:10%
Physicist Neil deGrasse
Tyson, for example.

00:15:59.900 --> 00:16:01.440 align:middle line:90%
This is a direct quote.

00:16:01.440 --> 00:16:04.160 align:middle line:84%
He says I think the
likelihood that we

00:16:04.160 --> 00:16:08.790 align:middle line:84%
are living in a simulated
reality may be very high.

00:16:08.790 --> 00:16:11.450 align:middle line:10%
He says the odds,
from his perspective,

00:16:11.450 --> 00:16:16.010 align:middle line:10%
are 50-50 that our entire
existence is a program

00:16:16.010 --> 00:16:18.100 align:middle line:10%
on someone else's hard drive.

00:16:18.100 --> 00:16:18.900 align:middle line:90%
All right.

00:16:18.900 --> 00:16:20.690 align:middle line:84%
Now, I don't necessarily
think that we're

00:16:20.690 --> 00:16:22.310 align:middle line:90%
experiencing on a hard drive.

00:16:22.310 --> 00:16:25.070 align:middle line:84%
I think it's a
kind of simulation

00:16:25.070 --> 00:16:27.950 align:middle line:84%
that we are only beginning to
understand on a quantum level

00:16:27.950 --> 00:16:29.810 align:middle line:90%
the size of the universe.

00:16:29.810 --> 00:16:33.350 align:middle line:84%
But Tyson is saying
that this probability--

00:16:33.350 --> 00:16:37.190 align:middle line:84%
it's more than 50-50 that
we're living on this.

00:16:37.190 --> 00:16:41.700 align:middle line:84%
Elon Musk, the futurist, the
inventor, the entrepreneur--

00:16:41.700 --> 00:16:42.890 align:middle line:90%
he agrees.

00:16:42.890 --> 00:16:45.920 align:middle line:10%
And in a fascinating
conversation

00:16:45.920 --> 00:16:48.560 align:middle line:10%
that he had during a
question and answer

00:16:48.560 --> 00:16:52.470 align:middle line:10%
at a recent conference, he
shared his personal thoughts

00:16:52.470 --> 00:16:53.270 align:middle line:10%
about this.

00:16:53.270 --> 00:16:56.840 align:middle line:10%
And I want to share with
you what Elon Musk said.

00:16:56.840 --> 00:17:00.860 align:middle line:84%
He was at a conference
that's called the Recode Code

00:17:00.860 --> 00:17:03.790 align:middle line:90%
Conference, 2016.

00:17:03.790 --> 00:17:06.980 align:middle line:84%
And there was an informal Q&A
at the end of the conference.

00:17:06.980 --> 00:17:10.099 align:middle line:84%
He was on the stage, and
someone in the audience

00:17:10.099 --> 00:17:11.859 align:middle line:90%
asked him a question.

00:17:11.859 --> 00:17:15.109 align:middle line:84%
And the question centered
around this possibility--

00:17:15.109 --> 00:17:18.470 align:middle line:84%
are we living in a
simulated reality?

00:17:18.470 --> 00:17:22.130 align:middle line:84%
And Elon Musk said
that this very question

00:17:22.130 --> 00:17:25.520 align:middle line:84%
has been at the core of
nearly every conversation

00:17:25.520 --> 00:17:29.270 align:middle line:84%
that he has had with his
staff, with the scientist,

00:17:29.270 --> 00:17:32.150 align:middle line:84%
with the engineers, with
the technologists that

00:17:32.150 --> 00:17:35.447 align:middle line:84%
work with him developing
future technologies.

00:17:35.447 --> 00:17:37.780 align:middle line:10%
>>ELON MUSK: So given that
we're clearly on a trajectory

00:17:37.780 --> 00:17:40.510 align:middle line:10%
to have games that are
indistinguishable from reality,

00:17:40.510 --> 00:17:43.540 align:middle line:10%
and those games could be
played on any set-top box

00:17:43.540 --> 00:17:46.420 align:middle line:10%
or on a PC or whatever,
and there would probably

00:17:46.420 --> 00:17:55.070 align:middle line:10%
be billions of such
computers or set-top boxes,

00:17:55.070 --> 00:17:59.990 align:middle line:10%
it would seem to follow that the
odds that we're in base reality

00:17:59.990 --> 00:18:01.010 align:middle line:10%
is one in billions.

00:18:01.010 --> 00:18:03.054 align:middle line:90%


00:18:03.054 --> 00:18:04.720 align:middle line:84%
Tell me what's wrong
with that argument.

00:18:04.720 --> 00:18:07.180 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Is the answer yes?

00:18:07.180 --> 00:18:09.880 align:middle line:84%
>>MUSK: The argument
is probably.

00:18:09.880 --> 00:18:11.400 align:middle line:10%
Is there a flaw
in that argument?

00:18:11.400 --> 00:18:11.770 align:middle line:10%
>>AUDIENCE: But someone--

00:18:11.770 --> 00:18:13.360 align:middle line:10%
>>MUSK: I'm not sure
what the error--

00:18:13.360 --> 00:18:13.870 align:middle line:10%
>>AUDIENCE: No, no.

00:18:13.870 --> 00:18:14.911 align:middle line:10%
The argument makes sense.

00:18:14.911 --> 00:18:19.360 align:middle line:10%
So the assumption then is
that somebody beat us to it.

00:18:19.360 --> 00:18:20.720 align:middle line:10%
And this is a game.

00:18:20.720 --> 00:18:21.520 align:middle line:90%
>>MUSK: No, no.

00:18:21.520 --> 00:18:24.530 align:middle line:84%
There's a one in billions chance
that this is base reality.

00:18:24.530 --> 00:18:25.840 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Oh, OK.

00:18:25.840 --> 00:18:27.159 align:middle line:10%
What do you think?

00:18:27.159 --> 00:18:28.950 align:middle line:10%
>>MUSK: Well, I think
it's one in billions.

00:18:28.950 --> 00:18:29.750 align:middle line:10%
>>AUDIENCE: OK.

00:18:29.750 --> 00:18:31.880 align:middle line:10%


00:18:31.880 --> 00:18:38.074 align:middle line:10%
>>MUSK: That seems to be
clearly what it would suggest.

00:18:38.074 --> 00:18:39.490 align:middle line:10%
And actually, I
mean, arguably, we

00:18:39.490 --> 00:18:43.260 align:middle line:10%
should hope that that's
true, because otherwise,

00:18:43.260 --> 00:18:46.480 align:middle line:10%
if civilization
stops advancing, then

00:18:46.480 --> 00:18:48.530 align:middle line:10%
that may be due to some
calamitous event that

00:18:48.530 --> 00:18:50.660 align:middle line:10%
erases civilization.

00:18:50.660 --> 00:18:53.450 align:middle line:10%
So maybe we should be hopeful
that this is a simulation,

00:18:53.450 --> 00:18:56.084 align:middle line:10%
because otherwise--

00:18:56.084 --> 00:18:58.000 align:middle line:10%
>>WALT MOSSBERG: Because
they could reboot it.

00:18:58.000 --> 00:19:00.030 align:middle line:10%
>>MUSK: Well,
otherwise, either we're

00:19:00.030 --> 00:19:02.040 align:middle line:10%
going to create
simulations that are

00:19:02.040 --> 00:19:04.240 align:middle line:10%
indistinguishable from
reality, or civilization

00:19:04.240 --> 00:19:05.300 align:middle line:10%
will cease to exist.

00:19:05.300 --> 00:19:06.150 align:middle line:10%
Those are the two options.

00:19:06.150 --> 00:19:08.280 align:middle line:84%
>>GREGG: In other words, he's
saying there's a billion to one

00:19:08.280 --> 00:19:09.930 align:middle line:84%
chance that this
is the real world.

00:19:09.930 --> 00:19:16.470 align:middle line:84%
The odds are so stacked in favor
of us living a digital reality,

00:19:16.470 --> 00:19:21.030 align:middle line:84%
a simulation, a virtual reality
now that we have the technology

00:19:21.030 --> 00:19:23.800 align:middle line:90%
to even know what that means.

00:19:23.800 --> 00:19:26.460 align:middle line:84%
So I'm sharing this
with you because we

00:19:26.460 --> 00:19:29.850 align:middle line:84%
have very quickly
since 2001 gone

00:19:29.850 --> 00:19:34.270 align:middle line:84%
from the first scientific
investigation-- is it possible?

00:19:34.270 --> 00:19:36.130 align:middle line:84%
Nick Bostrom developed
the algorithm.

00:19:36.130 --> 00:19:37.900 align:middle line:90%
He published the paper.

00:19:37.900 --> 00:19:41.200 align:middle line:84%
And that paper has been read
and reread and circulated

00:19:41.200 --> 00:19:46.120 align:middle line:84%
among scientific circles, peer
reviewed scientific circles,

00:19:46.120 --> 00:19:49.150 align:middle line:84%
and has now become
the foundation

00:19:49.150 --> 00:19:52.510 align:middle line:84%
for many other people,
from their perspectives,

00:19:52.510 --> 00:19:55.840 align:middle line:84%
asking the question,
contributing their expertise.

00:19:55.840 --> 00:20:00.160 align:middle line:84%
It's opened the door to
a new and empowering way

00:20:00.160 --> 00:20:03.080 align:middle line:84%
of us thinking about
ourselves and our relationship

00:20:03.080 --> 00:20:04.360 align:middle line:90%
to the world.

00:20:04.360 --> 00:20:07.960 align:middle line:84%
So now that you know that the
scientific investigation has

00:20:07.960 --> 00:20:11.590 align:middle line:84%
already begun, what I'd
like to do is talk to you

00:20:11.590 --> 00:20:15.270 align:middle line:84%
a little bit about what
these findings mean.

00:20:15.270 --> 00:20:17.320 align:middle line:84%
And for the rest of
this series, we're

00:20:17.320 --> 00:20:22.070 align:middle line:84%
going to delve into how such
a simulation is possible,

00:20:22.070 --> 00:20:24.760 align:middle line:84%
how does it work,
how does it play out

00:20:24.760 --> 00:20:27.000 align:middle line:84%
in our lives and
our relationships,

00:20:27.000 --> 00:20:30.190 align:middle line:84%
in the healing of our
bodies, in the times of war

00:20:30.190 --> 00:20:31.980 align:middle line:90%
and in times of peace.

00:20:31.980 --> 00:20:34.540 align:middle line:84%
Are all of these experiences
that we're having, are they

00:20:34.540 --> 00:20:36.700 align:middle line:84%
actually following
patterns that are

00:20:36.700 --> 00:20:38.980 align:middle line:90%
the hallmark of a simulation?

00:20:38.980 --> 00:20:40.900 align:middle line:84%
I'll tell you right
now, the answer is yes.

00:20:40.900 --> 00:20:46.720 align:middle line:84%
But when you see how closely
our real world is tracking

00:20:46.720 --> 00:20:49.870 align:middle line:84%
the properties of
a simulation, it

00:20:49.870 --> 00:20:52.630 align:middle line:84%
leads us to think of
ourselves and our relationship

00:20:52.630 --> 00:20:54.860 align:middle line:84%
to the world in a
very different way.

00:20:54.860 --> 00:20:58.910 align:middle line:84%
So how do we make sense of
what these algorithms are

00:20:58.910 --> 00:20:59.710 align:middle line:90%
telling us?

00:20:59.710 --> 00:21:03.130 align:middle line:84%
How do we make sense of
Bostrom's conclusions?

00:21:03.130 --> 00:21:05.920 align:middle line:84%
What I'd like to do for
the next few moments

00:21:05.920 --> 00:21:10.660 align:middle line:84%
is, let's compare what the
possibility of a simulation

00:21:10.660 --> 00:21:13.630 align:middle line:84%
in our world looks like
within the context of what

00:21:13.630 --> 00:21:16.420 align:middle line:84%
science is already telling
us about the world.

00:21:16.420 --> 00:21:18.970 align:middle line:84%
Science tells us, for
example, that the universe

00:21:18.970 --> 00:21:22.020 align:middle line:84%
began with a
beginning, a big bang,

00:21:22.020 --> 00:21:26.920 align:middle line:84%
a primal release of energy
that began an expansion that

00:21:26.920 --> 00:21:29.080 align:middle line:90%
continues to this moment.

00:21:29.080 --> 00:21:32.770 align:middle line:84%
The universe continues
to expand right now.

00:21:32.770 --> 00:21:36.700 align:middle line:84%
In simulation theory, this
would equate to the moment

00:21:36.700 --> 00:21:38.410 align:middle line:90%
the simulation began.

00:21:38.410 --> 00:21:41.470 align:middle line:84%
A simulation has to
have a place where

00:21:41.470 --> 00:21:45.040 align:middle line:84%
someone pushes the button,
and the patterns begin.

00:21:45.040 --> 00:21:49.930 align:middle line:84%
The patterns are spun out by a
mathematic algorithm that looks

00:21:49.930 --> 00:21:52.570 align:middle line:90%
to us like a release of energy.

00:21:52.570 --> 00:21:55.490 align:middle line:84%
Our release of energy
is based upon atoms,

00:21:55.490 --> 00:21:57.130 align:middle line:90%
molecules, elements.

00:21:57.130 --> 00:22:01.690 align:middle line:84%
Those are the creation of
what we are now seeing.

00:22:01.690 --> 00:22:04.540 align:middle line:84%
When we simulate these
things with our own software,

00:22:04.540 --> 00:22:09.190 align:middle line:84%
we can actually create
and mimic these functions.

00:22:09.190 --> 00:22:12.190 align:middle line:84%
I recently had the
opportunity to tour

00:22:12.190 --> 00:22:15.440 align:middle line:84%
the CERN superconducting
super collider in Geneva,

00:22:15.440 --> 00:22:18.580 align:middle line:84%
Switzerland, where scientists
are doing precisely this.

00:22:18.580 --> 00:22:22.060 align:middle line:84%
They are recreating the moment
that the universe began.

00:22:22.060 --> 00:22:24.970 align:middle line:84%
They're recreating the
big bang, because they

00:22:24.970 --> 00:22:29.740 align:middle line:84%
want to see what happened in the
first few fractions of a second

00:22:29.740 --> 00:22:31.810 align:middle line:84%
after that primal
release of energy

00:22:31.810 --> 00:22:36.760 align:middle line:84%
occurred that laid the
foundation of the properties

00:22:36.760 --> 00:22:39.730 align:middle line:84%
and the principles that we know
as the physics of the universe

00:22:39.730 --> 00:22:40.530 align:middle line:90%
today.

00:22:40.530 --> 00:22:45.020 align:middle line:84%
Well, in simulation theory, this
is precisely what would happen.

00:22:45.020 --> 00:22:49.570 align:middle line:84%
It's in those first few
fractions of a second

00:22:49.570 --> 00:22:54.150 align:middle line:84%
when the simulation begins that
the properties are established

00:22:54.150 --> 00:22:56.470 align:middle line:90%
that run that simulation.

00:22:56.470 --> 00:23:00.040 align:middle line:84%
The field of energy that
connects all things that we now

00:23:00.040 --> 00:23:04.790 align:middle line:84%
know exist, that field is
the container for all things.

00:23:04.790 --> 00:23:07.720 align:middle line:84%
So in the beginning
of our simulation,

00:23:07.720 --> 00:23:10.960 align:middle line:84%
there was a primal release
of energy, a field of energy

00:23:10.960 --> 00:23:15.050 align:middle line:84%
was formed, and we continue
to live and experience

00:23:15.050 --> 00:23:17.140 align:middle line:90%
within that field.

00:23:17.140 --> 00:23:19.000 align:middle line:84%
You can think of the
field in this way.

00:23:19.000 --> 00:23:22.570 align:middle line:84%
The field is the
container for all things

00:23:22.570 --> 00:23:23.890 align:middle line:90%
that we know and experience.

00:23:23.890 --> 00:23:26.870 align:middle line:84%
Nothing to us exists beyond
the container, number one.

00:23:26.870 --> 00:23:30.190 align:middle line:84%
Number two, the
field is the bridge

00:23:30.190 --> 00:23:32.500 align:middle line:84%
between our inner
and our outer world.

00:23:32.500 --> 00:23:36.310 align:middle line:84%
We are constantly communicating
with this field of energy

00:23:36.310 --> 00:23:38.440 align:middle line:84%
through an energy that
we create in our bodies.

00:23:38.440 --> 00:23:41.260 align:middle line:84%
And we're going to explore
that later in the series.

00:23:41.260 --> 00:23:44.530 align:middle line:84%
Number three, the
field of energy

00:23:44.530 --> 00:23:49.300 align:middle line:84%
created at the moment of our
simulation when it began--

00:23:49.300 --> 00:23:51.730 align:middle line:84%
or if you'd like to think
of it as the big bang--

00:23:51.730 --> 00:23:56.080 align:middle line:84%
that field of energy is a mirror
in the outer world reflecting

00:23:56.080 --> 00:23:58.990 align:middle line:84%
what we are creating through our
thoughts, feelings, emotions,

00:23:58.990 --> 00:24:02.320 align:middle line:84%
beliefs, channeled through
the nervous system and the DNA

00:24:02.320 --> 00:24:05.090 align:middle line:90%
of our biological experience.

00:24:05.090 --> 00:24:07.240 align:middle line:84%
So when we talk
about the simulation,

00:24:07.240 --> 00:24:11.410 align:middle line:84%
based upon what we now know,
what science is telling us,

00:24:11.410 --> 00:24:14.560 align:middle line:84%
the properties of that
field became what we today

00:24:14.560 --> 00:24:18.070 align:middle line:84%
know as the laws of
physics, the laws that

00:24:18.070 --> 00:24:22.240 align:middle line:84%
govern all matter, including
our bodies and our lives.

00:24:22.240 --> 00:24:24.850 align:middle line:84%
So with these ideas
in mind, we're

00:24:24.850 --> 00:24:26.950 align:middle line:90%
developing a new vocabulary.

00:24:26.950 --> 00:24:29.820 align:middle line:84%
It's a new way to
think about your life.

00:24:29.820 --> 00:24:32.320 align:middle line:84%
It's a new way to
think about your world.

00:24:32.320 --> 00:24:35.870 align:middle line:84%
With these ideas in
mind, the key is this--

00:24:35.870 --> 00:24:40.340 align:middle line:84%
for us to master this virtual
reality, this simulation

00:24:40.340 --> 00:24:42.500 align:middle line:84%
that we find
ourselves in, we must

00:24:42.500 --> 00:24:46.640 align:middle line:84%
master the relationships--
the laws are showing

00:24:46.640 --> 00:24:48.740 align:middle line:90%
to us, the laws of physics.

00:24:48.740 --> 00:24:52.700 align:middle line:10%
And this is where science and
spirituality come together.

00:24:52.700 --> 00:24:56.870 align:middle line:84%
They blend in a really beautiful
and a very powerful way.

00:24:56.870 --> 00:25:00.500 align:middle line:10%
Because as we understand
the laws of physics,

00:25:00.500 --> 00:25:03.440 align:middle line:10%
and we apply those
laws to what our most

00:25:03.440 --> 00:25:05.690 align:middle line:10%
cherished and ancient
spiritual traditions

00:25:05.690 --> 00:25:07.970 align:middle line:10%
have told us for
over 5,000 years,

00:25:07.970 --> 00:25:10.080 align:middle line:10%
a new possibility unfolds.

00:25:10.080 --> 00:25:12.671 align:middle line:84%
So I'm going to invite you
to think about it like this.

00:25:12.671 --> 00:25:17.540 align:middle line:84%
Within this field of energy,
we exist, encapsulated

00:25:17.540 --> 00:25:20.947 align:middle line:84%
in a reality that we know
is our everyday world.

00:25:20.947 --> 00:25:22.280 align:middle line:90%
We communicate with one another.

00:25:22.280 --> 00:25:25.880 align:middle line:84%
We have these physical
bodies that we

00:25:25.880 --> 00:25:27.530 align:middle line:90%
sense our world through.

00:25:27.530 --> 00:25:29.930 align:middle line:84%
We can eat chocolate
with these bodies.

00:25:29.930 --> 00:25:32.510 align:middle line:84%
We can see rainbows
with these bodies.

00:25:32.510 --> 00:25:35.030 align:middle line:84%
We can hold one another
with these bodies in the way

00:25:35.030 --> 00:25:39.050 align:middle line:84%
that we could not do if we
were simply energetic beings.

00:25:39.050 --> 00:25:42.410 align:middle line:84%
This is the value of being in
these physical bodies, to have

00:25:42.410 --> 00:25:46.520 align:middle line:84%
sensual experiences and to be
able to master what those mean.

00:25:46.520 --> 00:25:50.780 align:middle line:84%
However, within this
experience based

00:25:50.780 --> 00:25:53.660 align:middle line:84%
upon this principle
of the simulation

00:25:53.660 --> 00:25:56.520 align:middle line:84%
and the way we're
thinking about our world,

00:25:56.520 --> 00:26:02.720 align:middle line:84%
we also exist in another world
beyond this immediate reality.

00:26:02.720 --> 00:26:06.260 align:middle line:84%
We exist in a world
outside of the simulation.

00:26:06.260 --> 00:26:10.280 align:middle line:10%
So when you close your eyes,
and you take that deep breath,

00:26:10.280 --> 00:26:14.870 align:middle line:10%
and you go within and you
connect with yourself--

00:26:14.870 --> 00:26:18.500 align:middle line:10%
what you would call your higher
self or that little voice that

00:26:18.500 --> 00:26:21.890 align:middle line:10%
you connect with for intuition
to answer the questions

00:26:21.890 --> 00:26:24.800 align:middle line:10%
and give you direction
and guidance--

00:26:24.800 --> 00:26:28.460 align:middle line:10%
within the context of our
simulation, what we're actually

00:26:28.460 --> 00:26:32.180 align:middle line:10%
doing is communicating
with ourselves

00:26:32.180 --> 00:26:36.560 align:middle line:10%
outside of the simulation,
the part of ourselves

00:26:36.560 --> 00:26:41.180 align:middle line:10%
that has agreed, beyond
our immediate experience,

00:26:41.180 --> 00:26:43.210 align:middle line:10%
to guide and
supervise us while we

00:26:43.210 --> 00:26:46.370 align:middle line:10%
are in this simulation
learning something.

00:26:46.370 --> 00:26:49.080 align:middle line:84%
When we communicate with
a higher power, when

00:26:49.080 --> 00:26:52.790 align:middle line:84%
we communicate with God, and
we communicate with angels,

00:26:52.790 --> 00:26:56.570 align:middle line:84%
within the context of this
conversation, what we are

00:26:56.570 --> 00:27:02.600 align:middle line:84%
actually doing is moving our
awareness beyond the simulation

00:27:02.600 --> 00:27:06.890 align:middle line:84%
itself back into what is
called the base reality

00:27:06.890 --> 00:27:09.230 align:middle line:90%
or the original environment.

00:27:09.230 --> 00:27:11.990 align:middle line:84%
We mentioned this
earlier because I

00:27:11.990 --> 00:27:14.880 align:middle line:84%
wanted to establish
this foundation so

00:27:14.880 --> 00:27:18.150 align:middle line:84%
that we can tie into it as we
go throughout this program.

00:27:18.150 --> 00:27:20.720 align:middle line:84%
This opens up the door to
all kinds of possibilities.

00:27:20.720 --> 00:27:22.460 align:middle line:90%
Think about what this means.

00:27:22.460 --> 00:27:24.740 align:middle line:84%
Think about what this
means to you and me.

00:27:24.740 --> 00:27:27.590 align:middle line:84%
We are in here, but
we're also out there.

00:27:27.590 --> 00:27:29.720 align:middle line:90%
We are one and the same.

00:27:29.720 --> 00:27:32.540 align:middle line:84%
One of the things that
I really, really love

00:27:32.540 --> 00:27:34.460 align:middle line:84%
about the idea of
the simulation--

00:27:34.460 --> 00:27:37.040 align:middle line:84%
we've all heard that
life is eternal.

00:27:37.040 --> 00:27:40.820 align:middle line:84%
Maybe not these bodies, but
that our soul or our spirit

00:27:40.820 --> 00:27:43.460 align:middle line:84%
is eternal and
never really dies.

00:27:43.460 --> 00:27:47.030 align:middle line:84%
If this simulation
theory is correct,

00:27:47.030 --> 00:27:49.370 align:middle line:84%
it means that when
we no longer exist

00:27:49.370 --> 00:27:52.550 align:middle line:84%
within this simulated
environment,

00:27:52.550 --> 00:27:56.210 align:middle line:84%
we continue to exist beyond
this simulated environment.

00:27:56.210 --> 00:28:00.710 align:middle line:84%
We are out there,
projecting ourselves in here

00:28:00.710 --> 00:28:03.860 align:middle line:84%
to have an experience so
that we can learn and master

00:28:03.860 --> 00:28:07.470 align:middle line:84%
the laws of our simulation--
the laws of physics,

00:28:07.470 --> 00:28:10.520 align:middle line:84%
the laws of motion, the
laws of thermodynamics,

00:28:10.520 --> 00:28:14.690 align:middle line:84%
the laws of equal and
opposite force, all the laws

00:28:14.690 --> 00:28:16.310 align:middle line:90%
that we know of physics.

00:28:16.310 --> 00:28:20.420 align:middle line:84%
We're here exploring what those
mean, because it's possible

00:28:20.420 --> 00:28:24.650 align:middle line:84%
that we're going to need
to have those laws mastered

00:28:24.650 --> 00:28:28.140 align:middle line:84%
when we go to whatever world
it is we're going to next.

00:28:28.140 --> 00:28:32.610 align:middle line:10%
But it also suggests that
when we die in this world,

00:28:32.610 --> 00:28:34.640 align:middle line:10%
no matter how
horrible the death,

00:28:34.640 --> 00:28:39.650 align:middle line:10%
that it is just our simulated
existence that has passed away.

00:28:39.650 --> 00:28:43.040 align:middle line:10%
The essence continues
and lives on.

00:28:43.040 --> 00:28:44.556 align:middle line:90%
And we've all heard this.

00:28:44.556 --> 00:28:46.430 align:middle line:84%
We've all heard this in
religious traditions.

00:28:46.430 --> 00:28:48.720 align:middle line:84%
We've heard it with
our loved ones.

00:28:48.720 --> 00:28:52.960 align:middle line:84%
I was present just before my
grandfather left this world.

00:28:52.960 --> 00:28:55.710 align:middle line:84%
And one of the most
powerful things that I saw

00:28:55.710 --> 00:28:56.510 align:middle line:90%
was my grandfather.

00:28:56.510 --> 00:28:59.420 align:middle line:90%
He was lying in a hospital bed.

00:28:59.420 --> 00:29:01.940 align:middle line:84%
And he was already
between the worlds.

00:29:01.940 --> 00:29:04.260 align:middle line:90%
He was in an altered state.

00:29:04.260 --> 00:29:08.550 align:middle line:84%
And as he was passing, his arms
reached out in front of him

00:29:08.550 --> 00:29:10.080 align:middle line:90%
like this.

00:29:10.080 --> 00:29:14.820 align:middle line:84%
And he was making this gesture,
trying to hold someone,

00:29:14.820 --> 00:29:17.670 align:middle line:84%
and he had this huge
smile on his face.

00:29:17.670 --> 00:29:19.894 align:middle line:84%
And it was like he was
reaching for people

00:29:19.894 --> 00:29:21.060 align:middle line:90%
that were coming toward him.

00:29:21.060 --> 00:29:23.970 align:middle line:84%
And it touched me so
deeply, so powerfully,

00:29:23.970 --> 00:29:25.830 align:middle line:90%
to see that in that moment.

00:29:25.830 --> 00:29:28.519 align:middle line:84%
To me, it was a reassurance
that there is really

00:29:28.519 --> 00:29:29.560 align:middle line:90%
something else out there.

00:29:29.560 --> 00:29:32.180 align:middle line:90%
I sense that within myself.

00:29:32.180 --> 00:29:35.760 align:middle line:84%
But to see that reality with
a close relative, and someone

00:29:35.760 --> 00:29:38.780 align:middle line:84%
I love actually making
that transition,

00:29:38.780 --> 00:29:40.740 align:middle line:90%
is very powerful for me.

00:29:40.740 --> 00:29:42.720 align:middle line:84%
So all of these
ideas, we're going

00:29:42.720 --> 00:29:45.560 align:middle line:84%
to continue to explore
these and how they work.

00:29:45.560 --> 00:29:48.060 align:middle line:84%
I'm just-- with
broad brush strokes,

00:29:48.060 --> 00:29:50.160 align:middle line:84%
I'm laying out
the possibilities.

00:29:50.160 --> 00:29:53.490 align:middle line:84%
If we begin to think of
our lives and our world

00:29:53.490 --> 00:29:58.260 align:middle line:84%
in terms of a simulation,
it changes the way

00:29:58.260 --> 00:30:01.980 align:middle line:84%
that we view our
lives and our world.

00:30:01.980 --> 00:30:06.540 align:middle line:84%
It's the modern language for a
very ancient way of thinking.

00:30:06.540 --> 00:30:09.420 align:middle line:84%
It's the contemporary
language of science

00:30:09.420 --> 00:30:11.100 align:middle line:84%
for a very ancient
way of thinking

00:30:11.100 --> 00:30:14.860 align:middle line:84%
that's been relegated to
spirituality and mysticism

00:30:14.860 --> 00:30:15.660 align:middle line:90%
and religion.

00:30:15.660 --> 00:30:19.990 align:middle line:90%


00:30:19.990 --> 00:30:23.970 align:middle line:84%
So for now, based upon
Bostrom's paper and the thinking

00:30:23.970 --> 00:30:27.360 align:middle line:84%
of people like Elon Musk,
Neil deGrasse Tyson,

00:30:27.360 --> 00:30:30.720 align:middle line:84%
and a growing list of
mainstream scientists,

00:30:30.720 --> 00:30:33.630 align:middle line:84%
let's assume for the
rest of this series

00:30:33.630 --> 00:30:37.170 align:middle line:84%
that we are, in fact, living
in a simulated reality.

00:30:37.170 --> 00:30:39.600 align:middle line:90%
Let's assume that this is true.

00:30:39.600 --> 00:30:42.930 align:middle line:84%
And it opens the door
then to the next question

00:30:42.930 --> 00:30:46.665 align:middle line:84%
that allows us to explore
the question of why.

00:30:46.665 --> 00:30:49.440 align:middle line:84%
Why would we be living
in a simulation?

00:30:49.440 --> 00:30:50.660 align:middle line:90%
What would be the purpose?

00:30:50.660 --> 00:30:54.180 align:middle line:84%
What could we gain from
such an experience?

00:30:54.180 --> 00:30:56.610 align:middle line:84%
Well, as it is with
any simulation,

00:30:56.610 --> 00:30:59.310 align:middle line:84%
we can assume that we're
here to master something.

00:30:59.310 --> 00:31:03.200 align:middle line:84%
Now, we need to understand
what that might be.

00:31:03.200 --> 00:31:05.940 align:middle line:84%
I mentioned earlier
in the series

00:31:05.940 --> 00:31:10.470 align:middle line:84%
that there is a growing
body of scientific evidence

00:31:10.470 --> 00:31:13.860 align:middle line:84%
suggesting that consciousness
communicates with itself

00:31:13.860 --> 00:31:17.970 align:middle line:84%
constantly, that we
are informing ourselves

00:31:17.970 --> 00:31:21.060 align:middle line:84%
through our creations, through
our art, through our music,

00:31:21.060 --> 00:31:23.400 align:middle line:84%
through our books, and
through our movies.

00:31:23.400 --> 00:31:27.390 align:middle line:84%
With this idea in mind, when
we think about a simulation,

00:31:27.390 --> 00:31:30.290 align:middle line:84%
what could be the purpose
of our simulation?

00:31:30.290 --> 00:31:34.290 align:middle line:84%
Well, maybe the theme of our
creations gives us a clue.

00:31:34.290 --> 00:31:37.350 align:middle line:84%
Almost universally,
the films that

00:31:37.350 --> 00:31:40.980 align:middle line:84%
are the most popular today,
the blockbuster films,

00:31:40.980 --> 00:31:45.600 align:middle line:84%
they are illustrating
possible futures of breakdown,

00:31:45.600 --> 00:31:48.240 align:middle line:90%
of collapse, of war and disease.

00:31:48.240 --> 00:31:51.990 align:middle line:84%
Is it possible that
we are actually

00:31:51.990 --> 00:31:55.710 align:middle line:84%
living an advanced
civilization where

00:31:55.710 --> 00:31:58.500 align:middle line:84%
we are learning the great
lessons that consciousness

00:31:58.500 --> 00:32:00.030 align:middle line:90%
is informing us of?

00:32:00.030 --> 00:32:04.260 align:middle line:84%
Have we experienced a great war
that has destroyed our world?

00:32:04.260 --> 00:32:06.630 align:middle line:84%
Have we experienced
a pandemic disease

00:32:06.630 --> 00:32:10.050 align:middle line:84%
that has wiped out much of
the life on this planet?

00:32:10.050 --> 00:32:13.030 align:middle line:90%
Have we depleted the resources?

00:32:13.030 --> 00:32:15.810 align:middle line:84%
Has climate change
destroyed the world

00:32:15.810 --> 00:32:17.370 align:middle line:90%
that we've known in the past?

00:32:17.370 --> 00:32:20.580 align:middle line:84%
Are we living in a
simulation to learn

00:32:20.580 --> 00:32:24.330 align:middle line:84%
a way of being
because we need to,

00:32:24.330 --> 00:32:28.620 align:middle line:84%
because we need to find a new
world and a new way of living?

00:32:28.620 --> 00:32:33.300 align:middle line:84%
All of these possibilities
now become something very real

00:32:33.300 --> 00:32:36.900 align:middle line:84%
and perhaps probable
based upon the algorithms

00:32:36.900 --> 00:32:40.440 align:middle line:84%
and the mathematics that suggest
we're already in a simulation.

00:32:40.440 --> 00:32:43.530 align:middle line:84%
Maybe we're here because
we need to be here,

00:32:43.530 --> 00:32:46.660 align:middle line:84%
because we need to
learn about ourselves

00:32:46.660 --> 00:32:48.990 align:middle line:90%
and a new way of being.

00:32:48.990 --> 00:32:52.320 align:middle line:84%
This idea of us
living in a simulation

00:32:52.320 --> 00:32:55.050 align:middle line:84%
was actually an idea
that was put forward

00:32:55.050 --> 00:32:58.180 align:middle line:90%
by a Chinese emperor long ago.

00:32:58.180 --> 00:33:00.450 align:middle line:90%
His name was Master Zhuang.

00:33:00.450 --> 00:33:06.030 align:middle line:10%
And what he said at that time
in a nonscientific manner echoes

00:33:06.030 --> 00:33:08.400 align:middle line:10%
precisely the ideas that
we're talking about here.

00:33:08.400 --> 00:33:11.100 align:middle line:84%
And I'd just like to share
his statement with you.

00:33:11.100 --> 00:33:13.410 align:middle line:84%
Listen to this, how
beautiful it is.

00:33:13.410 --> 00:33:16.020 align:middle line:84%
He said that the
emperor dreamed that he

00:33:16.020 --> 00:33:21.540 align:middle line:84%
was a butterfly dreaming
he was an emperor.

00:33:21.540 --> 00:33:25.260 align:middle line:84%
This is an illustration
of a way of thinking.

00:33:25.260 --> 00:33:29.190 align:middle line:84%
He dreamed that he was one
thing and within that one thing

00:33:29.190 --> 00:33:30.960 align:middle line:90%
that he was something else.

00:33:30.960 --> 00:33:35.050 align:middle line:84%
He was moving from one
reality to another to another.

00:33:35.050 --> 00:33:37.650 align:middle line:84%
Now that scientific
investigations tell us

00:33:37.650 --> 00:33:40.410 align:middle line:84%
that it's more likely
than not that we

00:33:40.410 --> 00:33:42.930 align:middle line:84%
are living in a
computer simulation,

00:33:42.930 --> 00:33:44.310 align:middle line:90%
the question becomes, why?

00:33:44.310 --> 00:33:45.900 align:middle line:90%
What are we learning?

00:33:45.900 --> 00:33:48.580 align:middle line:84%
What do we gain from
such an experience?

00:33:48.580 --> 00:33:50.490 align:middle line:84%
Well, to answer
these questions means

00:33:50.490 --> 00:33:54.930 align:middle line:84%
that we must reveal the deepest
truth of humankind's most

00:33:54.930 --> 00:33:56.560 align:middle line:90%
ancient secret.

00:33:56.560 --> 00:33:59.520 align:middle line:84%
It's the ability to
awaken within each of us

00:33:59.520 --> 00:34:03.590 align:middle line:84%
