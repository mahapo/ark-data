00:00:08.838 --> 00:00:25.060 align:middle line:90%


00:00:25.060 --> 00:00:26.200 align:middle line:90%
>> My name is Gregg Braden.

00:00:26.200 --> 00:00:29.350 align:middle line:84%
I'd like to welcome you to
this very special presentation

00:00:29.350 --> 00:00:33.670 align:middle line:84%
of "Missing Links", the deep
truth of our origin, history,

00:00:33.670 --> 00:00:35.800 align:middle line:90%
destiny, and fate.

00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:37.690 align:middle line:84%
In our last episode
we discovered

00:00:37.690 --> 00:00:41.530 align:middle line:84%
how the mysterious
genetic fusion of DNA

00:00:41.530 --> 00:00:44.500 align:middle line:84%
endows us with this
extraordinary potential.

00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:46.420 align:middle line:84%
And we also
discovered that we can

00:00:46.420 --> 00:00:49.810 align:middle line:84%
awaken this potential when
we choose, when we want,

00:00:49.810 --> 00:00:51.490 align:middle line:90%
on demand.

00:00:51.490 --> 00:00:54.040 align:middle line:84%
Well, in this episode
I'd like to explore

00:00:54.040 --> 00:00:57.040 align:middle line:84%
two of those abilities, two
of those potentials-- super

00:00:57.040 --> 00:01:00.700 align:middle line:84%
learning and deep intuition,
as well as the technique

00:01:00.700 --> 00:01:04.370 align:middle line:84%
that we use to awaken
these things in our lives.

00:01:04.370 --> 00:01:08.590 align:middle line:84%
So we're talking about
this union, this marriage

00:01:08.590 --> 00:01:11.140 align:middle line:84%
between our heart and our
brains-- a very, very different

00:01:11.140 --> 00:01:14.500 align:middle line:84%
way to think about
things in the West,

00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:17.200 align:middle line:84%
very different from what
we are traditionally

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:19.150 align:middle line:90%
invited to consider.

00:01:19.150 --> 00:01:22.180 align:middle line:84%
When I was in school, I was
taught that the brain is

00:01:22.180 --> 00:01:24.320 align:middle line:90%
the master organ in the body.

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:27.130 align:middle line:84%
And when I am working
with indigenous people,

00:01:27.130 --> 00:01:28.690 align:middle line:84%
often I'm taught
that the heart is

00:01:28.690 --> 00:01:30.900 align:middle line:90%
the master organ in the body.

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:33.880 align:middle line:84%
And I want to just say
to you that both of those

00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:35.980 align:middle line:90%
are valid in some circumstances.

00:01:35.980 --> 00:01:39.340 align:middle line:84%
But the truth is, they're both
incomplete, because what we now

00:01:39.340 --> 00:01:41.360 align:middle line:90%
know is that while the brain--

00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:43.420 align:middle line:84%
our brain-- releases
the chemistry

00:01:43.420 --> 00:01:46.360 align:middle line:84%
into our bodies for
rejuvenation, and healing,

00:01:46.360 --> 00:01:48.970 align:middle line:84%
and hormonal balance, and
all these other things,

00:01:48.970 --> 00:01:52.300 align:middle line:84%
our brain receives many of
the instructions that tell it

00:01:52.300 --> 00:01:54.100 align:middle line:90%
what to do from the heart.

00:01:54.100 --> 00:01:56.400 align:middle line:84%
And we are the ones that
create the instructions

00:01:56.400 --> 00:01:58.840 align:middle line:84%
through our thoughts,
feelings, emotions, and beliefs

00:01:58.840 --> 00:02:01.370 align:middle line:84%
that we are creating
in our hearts,

00:02:01.370 --> 00:02:04.750 align:middle line:84%
because now, as you remember,
the studies are showing

00:02:04.750 --> 00:02:07.510 align:middle line:84%
our heart has the ability
to think on its own,

00:02:07.510 --> 00:02:10.330 align:middle line:84%
to remember, and
to feel on its own.

00:02:10.330 --> 00:02:14.140 align:middle line:84%
So we're having a
new sense of what

00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:17.320 align:middle line:84%
this heart-brain
connection is all about.

00:02:17.320 --> 00:02:18.970 align:middle line:84%
And as I mentioned
before, we've been

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:20.990 align:middle line:84%
conditioned to use
them independently,

00:02:20.990 --> 00:02:22.760 align:middle line:90%
one or the other.

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:25.990 align:middle line:84%
So I'm acknowledging that I know
this is a very different way

00:02:25.990 --> 00:02:27.850 align:middle line:84%
to think about our
heart and our brain,

00:02:27.850 --> 00:02:30.130 align:middle line:84%
to think about them
as two organs that

00:02:30.130 --> 00:02:33.460 align:middle line:84%
support a single,
common neural network.

00:02:33.460 --> 00:02:35.080 align:middle line:84%
And just in case
there's any question

00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:37.246 align:middle line:84%
in your mind, that network--
it is about the nerves.

00:02:37.246 --> 00:02:39.520 align:middle line:84%
It's about the spinal
cord between the heart

00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:41.800 align:middle line:84%
and the brain, and the vagus
nerve between the heart

00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:43.116 align:middle line:90%
and the brain.

00:02:43.116 --> 00:02:45.490 align:middle line:84%
And this conversation between
the heart and the brain, it

00:02:45.490 --> 00:02:47.000 align:middle line:90%
fascinates me.

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:49.100 align:middle line:84%
It's a big conversation
that's happening

00:02:49.100 --> 00:02:50.950 align:middle line:90%
in every moment of every day.

00:02:50.950 --> 00:02:53.650 align:middle line:84%
But the thing is, most
of the conversation

00:02:53.650 --> 00:02:57.760 align:middle line:84%
is, in fact, coming from
our heart to our brain.

00:02:57.760 --> 00:02:59.590 align:middle line:84%
That's where the
thickest nerve bundle is,

00:02:59.590 --> 00:03:01.720 align:middle line:90%
to support that conversation.

00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:04.900 align:middle line:10%
There is a lesser
conversation from the brain,

00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:08.890 align:middle line:10%
through the spinal cord,
back into the heart.

00:03:08.890 --> 00:03:10.804 align:middle line:10%
So while it's
possible, the brain

00:03:10.804 --> 00:03:12.220 align:middle line:10%
doesn't say too
much to the heart.

00:03:12.220 --> 00:03:14.890 align:middle line:10%
The heart has a lot
to say to the brain.

00:03:14.890 --> 00:03:20.249 align:middle line:84%
All of this connection
leads to the capabilities

00:03:20.249 --> 00:03:22.290 align:middle line:84%
that we began speaking
about in the last episode.

00:03:22.290 --> 00:03:24.373 align:middle line:84%
And I'm going to talk about
them a little bit more

00:03:24.373 --> 00:03:26.290 align:middle line:90%
now in more detail.

00:03:26.290 --> 00:03:28.690 align:middle line:90%
This whole idea of intuition--

00:03:28.690 --> 00:03:30.400 align:middle line:90%
it's a very powerful sense.

00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:33.010 align:middle line:84%
It is a knowing,
a direct knowing,

00:03:33.010 --> 00:03:36.940 align:middle line:84%
our hearts knowing of when
something is true for us

00:03:36.940 --> 00:03:38.560 align:middle line:90%
and when it's not.

00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:42.760 align:middle line:84%
And we have to be very, very
clear about when we're actually

00:03:42.760 --> 00:03:45.220 align:middle line:84%
hearing information
from our heart,

00:03:45.220 --> 00:03:47.329 align:middle line:84%
or whether the information
is coming from there.

00:03:47.329 --> 00:03:49.120 align:middle line:84%
Or maybe it's coming
from the subconscious,

00:03:49.120 --> 00:03:51.160 align:middle line:84%
or maybe it's
coming from a fear.

00:03:51.160 --> 00:03:54.160 align:middle line:84%
It's just good to be very clear
about where this information is

00:03:54.160 --> 00:03:55.160 align:middle line:90%
coming from.

00:03:55.160 --> 00:03:57.250 align:middle line:84%
And people ask me
all the time, when

00:03:57.250 --> 00:03:59.290 align:middle line:84%
I speak at live
events-- they ask

00:03:59.290 --> 00:04:02.800 align:middle line:84%
me to make decisions for
them and to interpret

00:04:02.800 --> 00:04:04.720 align:middle line:90%
their experiences for them.

00:04:04.720 --> 00:04:07.660 align:middle line:84%
But I could never
decide, and I could never

00:04:07.660 --> 00:04:09.500 align:middle line:84%
interpret because
the experiences have

00:04:09.500 --> 00:04:10.300 align:middle line:90%
happened to them.

00:04:10.300 --> 00:04:11.970 align:middle line:90%
Let me just give you an example.

00:04:11.970 --> 00:04:14.850 align:middle line:84%
It's very common for people to
ask me, Gregg, I had a dream

00:04:14.850 --> 00:04:15.650 align:middle line:90%
last night.

00:04:15.650 --> 00:04:17.550 align:middle line:84%
And in the dream--
and very detailed--

00:04:17.550 --> 00:04:18.350 align:middle line:90%
I saw this.

00:04:18.350 --> 00:04:19.390 align:middle line:90%
I saw that.

00:04:19.390 --> 00:04:21.200 align:middle line:84%
Gregg, what does
this dream mean?

00:04:21.200 --> 00:04:23.635 align:middle line:84%
And what I have to say
to them, very honestly

00:04:23.635 --> 00:04:26.380 align:middle line:84%
and very factually, is I
couldn't begin to tell you

00:04:26.380 --> 00:04:27.550 align:middle line:90%
what that dream means.

00:04:27.550 --> 00:04:29.860 align:middle line:84%
I have no idea, I
didn't have the dream.

00:04:29.860 --> 00:04:30.900 align:middle line:90%
You had the dream.

00:04:30.900 --> 00:04:32.980 align:middle line:84%
And I'm saying this
to you right now.

00:04:32.980 --> 00:04:37.660 align:middle line:84%
If you are powerful enough to
have the kinds of dreams that

00:04:37.660 --> 00:04:40.300 align:middle line:84%
are so vivid and so lucid
that you remember them

00:04:40.300 --> 00:04:43.750 align:middle line:84%
even in your waking hours,
then you are powerful enough

00:04:43.750 --> 00:04:48.110 align:middle line:84%
to ask your own body,
to ask your intuition,

00:04:48.110 --> 00:04:52.070 align:middle line:84%
to ask your heart, what
does this dream mean for me?

00:04:52.070 --> 00:04:54.340 align:middle line:84%
What am I being
shown in this dream?

00:04:54.340 --> 00:04:56.710 align:middle line:84%
Why am I being shown
what I'm showing?

00:04:56.710 --> 00:04:58.210 align:middle line:90%
What does it mean in my life?

00:04:58.210 --> 00:05:00.500 align:middle line:90%
Ask those kinds of questions.

00:05:00.500 --> 00:05:02.980 align:middle line:84%
When you ask them,
if you will ask them

00:05:02.980 --> 00:05:05.350 align:middle line:84%
from your heart, rather
than your brain-- and

00:05:05.350 --> 00:05:07.660 align:middle line:84%
we're going to share the
techniques, in this episode,

00:05:07.660 --> 00:05:09.610 align:middle line:90%
about precisely how to do it.

00:05:09.610 --> 00:05:11.807 align:middle line:90%
It's another form of intuition.

00:05:11.807 --> 00:05:13.390 align:middle line:84%
And I'm saying this
now to acknowledge

00:05:13.390 --> 00:05:16.600 align:middle line:84%
that I know intuition has
a lot of different forms.

00:05:16.600 --> 00:05:18.790 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes our intuition,
it is spontaneous,

00:05:18.790 --> 00:05:21.820 align:middle line:84%
like the phone calls
between my mother and I

00:05:21.820 --> 00:05:23.320 align:middle line:84%
that I spoke of in
the last episode.

00:05:23.320 --> 00:05:25.920 align:middle line:84%
I pick up the phone,
she's already there.

00:05:25.920 --> 00:05:28.410 align:middle line:84%
Other kinds of intuition,
we just call a gut instinct.

00:05:28.410 --> 00:05:30.990 align:middle line:84%
That's a form of
intuition as well.

00:05:30.990 --> 00:05:35.850 align:middle line:84%
Scientists tell us, for
example, that we know--

00:05:35.850 --> 00:05:38.265 align:middle line:84%
when we meet another
person, we will

00:05:38.265 --> 00:05:40.290 align:middle line:90%
know within three seconds--

00:05:40.290 --> 00:05:41.610 align:middle line:90%
now think about this.

00:05:41.610 --> 00:05:43.890 align:middle line:84%
You will know
within three seconds

00:05:43.890 --> 00:05:46.650 align:middle line:84%
if you like someone or
not, when you meet them.

00:05:46.650 --> 00:05:49.140 align:middle line:84%
Your intuition, your
heart will know.

00:05:49.140 --> 00:05:51.300 align:middle line:84%
Now, in our culture,
we are taught

00:05:51.300 --> 00:05:53.170 align:middle line:84%
to discount that,
because we say,

00:05:53.170 --> 00:05:54.480 align:middle line:90%
oh, you're being judgmental.

00:05:54.480 --> 00:05:55.320 align:middle line:90%
You don't even know the person.

00:05:55.320 --> 00:05:56.653 align:middle line:90%
You haven't given them a chance.

00:05:56.653 --> 00:06:00.270 align:middle line:84%
And that's all true, but your
heart has picked up something.

00:06:00.270 --> 00:06:03.960 align:middle line:84%
It's picked up something in
a vibratory, energetic field,

00:06:03.960 --> 00:06:04.835 align:middle line:90%
about another person.

00:06:04.835 --> 00:06:06.793 align:middle line:84%
I'm not saying it's right,
wrong, good, or bad.

00:06:06.793 --> 00:06:09.220 align:middle line:84%
It's something that just
may not be a good fit.

00:06:09.220 --> 00:06:10.980 align:middle line:90%
And it's telling you that.

00:06:10.980 --> 00:06:12.570 align:middle line:84%
And there's a reason
why we have this.

00:06:12.570 --> 00:06:17.820 align:middle line:84%
Our ancestors had this long
ago, because 10,000 years ago we

00:06:17.820 --> 00:06:20.280 align:middle line:84%
didn't have the opportunity
to invite someone

00:06:20.280 --> 00:06:23.610 align:middle line:84%
to have coffee in a coffee
shop and get to know them,

00:06:23.610 --> 00:06:26.280 align:middle line:84%
to know if they were
a threat to us or not.

00:06:26.280 --> 00:06:28.080 align:middle line:90%
We had to know immediately.

00:06:28.080 --> 00:06:30.360 align:middle line:84%
When we met someone
out on the open plains,

00:06:30.360 --> 00:06:32.747 align:middle line:84%
or if you walked into a
cave to make it your home

00:06:32.747 --> 00:06:34.830 align:middle line:84%
and found that it was
already someone else's home,

00:06:34.830 --> 00:06:35.520 align:middle line:90%
is that a threat?

00:06:35.520 --> 00:06:36.630 align:middle line:90%
Is that a personal threat?

00:06:36.630 --> 00:06:38.760 align:middle line:84%
And we need to know
really, really fast.

00:06:38.760 --> 00:06:41.670 align:middle line:84%
But it goes even
deeper than that.

00:06:41.670 --> 00:06:45.420 align:middle line:84%
One of the really
fascinating pieces

00:06:45.420 --> 00:06:49.380 align:middle line:84%
of research that
we're beginning to see

00:06:49.380 --> 00:06:51.760 align:middle line:84%
is that men and women
think differently.

00:06:51.760 --> 00:06:52.560 align:middle line:90%
We know that.

00:06:52.560 --> 00:06:54.030 align:middle line:90%
That's not the research.

00:06:54.030 --> 00:06:56.220 align:middle line:84%
But women and men do
think very differently.

00:06:56.220 --> 00:06:59.520 align:middle line:84%
And this is one of the places
where our intuitive instincts

00:06:59.520 --> 00:07:01.830 align:middle line:90%
become very, very different.

00:07:01.830 --> 00:07:05.520 align:middle line:84%
Studies have shown
that a woman, a woman

00:07:05.520 --> 00:07:12.240 align:middle line:84%
will know, in her heart, within
180 seconds-- that's 3 minutes.

00:07:12.240 --> 00:07:15.030 align:middle line:84%
A woman will know
within 180 seconds

00:07:15.030 --> 00:07:18.870 align:middle line:84%
if the person standing
before her, in her field,

00:07:18.870 --> 00:07:23.490 align:middle line:84%
is a potential compatible
life mate or not--

00:07:23.490 --> 00:07:25.260 align:middle line:90%
successful life mate.

00:07:25.260 --> 00:07:26.910 align:middle line:90%
A woman's heart will know.

00:07:26.910 --> 00:07:31.540 align:middle line:84%
Her intuition will know within
180 seconds, on the one hand.

00:07:31.540 --> 00:07:34.740 align:middle line:84%
But in our culture,
we are so often

00:07:34.740 --> 00:07:36.060 align:middle line:90%
conditioned to discount that.

00:07:36.060 --> 00:07:38.250 align:middle line:90%
So a woman will feel that.

00:07:38.250 --> 00:07:39.780 align:middle line:90%
She'll discount that.

00:07:39.780 --> 00:07:43.310 align:middle line:84%
And she will give that person
that she has encountered

00:07:43.310 --> 00:07:47.370 align:middle line:84%
3, 5, 10, maybe 20
years of her life

00:07:47.370 --> 00:07:50.280 align:middle line:84%
to experience and
demonstrate in real life

00:07:50.280 --> 00:07:52.980 align:middle line:84%
what her heart knew
in only 3 minutes.

00:07:52.980 --> 00:07:55.140 align:middle line:84%
And we see this
happen all the time.

00:07:55.140 --> 00:07:57.970 align:middle line:84%
I actually have friends,
multiple friends,

00:07:57.970 --> 00:08:02.760 align:middle line:84%
that this has happened to, where
partners agreed to be married.

00:08:02.760 --> 00:08:05.340 align:middle line:84%
And on the day of the
wedding, the woman

00:08:05.340 --> 00:08:08.010 align:middle line:84%
says, I can't go
through with this,

00:08:08.010 --> 00:08:10.560 align:middle line:84%
because this is not the
right person for me.

00:08:10.560 --> 00:08:11.690 align:middle line:90%
She has known all along.

00:08:11.690 --> 00:08:14.110 align:middle line:90%
She always had this suspicion.

00:08:14.110 --> 00:08:17.040 align:middle line:84%
But she says, I can't
go through with it.

00:08:17.040 --> 00:08:20.040 align:middle line:84%
However, the peer
pressure of all the family

00:08:20.040 --> 00:08:22.740 align:middle line:84%
coming from all over the
world, all of the energy,

00:08:22.740 --> 00:08:25.740 align:middle line:84%
all of the money, all the
preparations, all the friends--

00:08:25.740 --> 00:08:28.410 align:middle line:84%
in the case that I'm thinking of
right now, this friend of mine

00:08:28.410 --> 00:08:31.380 align:middle line:84%
actually went through
with the wedding,

00:08:31.380 --> 00:08:33.564 align:middle line:84%
knowing that it would
not last and that she

00:08:33.564 --> 00:08:35.730 align:middle line:84%
would have to end the wedding
at another time, which

00:08:35.730 --> 00:08:37.799 align:middle line:90%
she did about a year later.

00:08:37.799 --> 00:08:39.870 align:middle line:84%
So it happens that
way, sometimes.

00:08:39.870 --> 00:08:42.210 align:middle line:84%
And I have a male friend
that had the same experience.

00:08:42.210 --> 00:08:44.750 align:middle line:84%
I was going to be the
best man in his wedding.

00:08:44.750 --> 00:08:48.130 align:middle line:84%
I went to pick him up
in northern Missouri.

00:08:48.130 --> 00:08:50.730 align:middle line:84%
And he was sitting on the front
porch in a pair of blue jeans

00:08:50.730 --> 00:08:52.080 align:middle line:90%
and flip-flops.

00:08:52.080 --> 00:08:54.506 align:middle line:84%
And I was in a tux
for his wedding.

00:08:54.506 --> 00:08:55.880 align:middle line:84%
And he said, where
are you going?

00:08:55.880 --> 00:08:57.463 align:middle line:84%
And I said, I'm going
to your wedding.

00:08:57.463 --> 00:08:58.339 align:middle line:90%
And he said, I can't.

00:08:58.339 --> 00:08:59.546 align:middle line:90%
I can't go through with this.

00:08:59.546 --> 00:09:01.800 align:middle line:84%
He says, I'm going to go
fishing today, and he did.

00:09:01.800 --> 00:09:02.970 align:middle line:90%
He left and went fishing.

00:09:02.970 --> 00:09:07.800 align:middle line:84%
And we had to tell his fiance
what it was that was happening.

00:09:07.800 --> 00:09:09.900 align:middle line:84%
And I'm sharing
this story with you

00:09:09.900 --> 00:09:12.780 align:middle line:84%
because it was a doubt
that he had in his mind.

00:09:12.780 --> 00:09:14.280 align:middle line:84%
But when they
reconciled that doubt,

00:09:14.280 --> 00:09:15.746 align:middle line:90%
they ended up getting married.

00:09:15.746 --> 00:09:16.620 align:middle line:90%
They did get married.

00:09:16.620 --> 00:09:19.170 align:middle line:84%
And they have been married
now for over 30 years.

00:09:19.170 --> 00:09:23.040 align:middle line:84%
So it's all about
realizing and recognizing,

00:09:23.040 --> 00:09:25.780 align:middle line:84%
what is our intuition
saying to us?

00:09:25.780 --> 00:09:27.930 align:middle line:84%
And one of the ways
to do that, rather

00:09:27.930 --> 00:09:31.950 align:middle line:84%
than through the fear and
the peer pressure, is we've

00:09:31.950 --> 00:09:34.590 align:middle line:84%
got to go into our heart to
understand exactly what it

00:09:34.590 --> 00:09:36.310 align:middle line:90%
is that it's saying.

00:09:36.310 --> 00:09:39.870 align:middle line:84%
Let me just give you another
example of how this plays out,

00:09:39.870 --> 00:09:42.600 align:middle line:84%
and it's a personal
example for me.

00:09:42.600 --> 00:09:45.645 align:middle line:84%
I was in Australia
over September 11.

00:09:45.645 --> 00:09:47.520 align:middle line:10%
I couldn't even get back
into my own country.

00:09:47.520 --> 00:09:49.540 align:middle line:10%
The air traffic was closed.

00:09:49.540 --> 00:09:52.260 align:middle line:10%
And when they opened
the air traffic again,

00:09:52.260 --> 00:09:55.380 align:middle line:10%
I was on the first flight
from Sydney, Australia

00:09:55.380 --> 00:09:59.282 align:middle line:10%
back into Los Angeles,
California, here in the States.

00:09:59.282 --> 00:10:00.990 align:middle line:84%
There weren't many
people on that flight.

00:10:00.990 --> 00:10:05.550 align:middle line:84%
It was a huge plane, and there
were fewer than 20 people

00:10:05.550 --> 00:10:07.440 align:middle line:90%
on the entire flight.

00:10:07.440 --> 00:10:10.170 align:middle line:84%
So when the flight
was ready to board,

00:10:10.170 --> 00:10:14.040 align:middle line:84%
the gate attendant came out
and made an announcement.

00:10:14.040 --> 00:10:15.479 align:middle line:90%
And here's what she said.

00:10:15.479 --> 00:10:17.520 align:middle line:84%
She said, there are so
few people on this flight,

00:10:17.520 --> 00:10:18.936 align:middle line:84%
we're not going
to board in zones.

00:10:18.936 --> 00:10:21.630 align:middle line:84%
You can board whenever
you'd like to.

00:10:21.630 --> 00:10:25.460 align:middle line:84%
She said, you can board
this plane for the States,

00:10:25.460 --> 00:10:29.460 align:middle line:84%
and it will get you there, if
that's where you want to go.

00:10:29.460 --> 00:10:31.360 align:middle line:84%
And I looked at her,
and I said, well,

00:10:31.360 --> 00:10:35.130 align:middle line:84%
that's a powerful vote of
confidence for this flight.

00:10:35.130 --> 00:10:37.710 align:middle line:84%
And she says, hey, if you
want to take this plane

00:10:37.710 --> 00:10:40.086 align:middle line:84%
and go to America, this plane
is going to take you there.

00:10:40.086 --> 00:10:41.876 align:middle line:84%
She goes, we don't know
what just happened.

00:10:41.876 --> 00:10:43.740 align:middle line:84%
And it looks really,
really scary from where

00:10:43.740 --> 00:10:46.600 align:middle line:84%
we are right now-- never
seen this happen before.

00:10:46.600 --> 00:10:48.990 align:middle line:84%
And it set up a little
fear in my mind.

00:10:48.990 --> 00:10:51.100 align:middle line:84%
So I asked her, I said,
please wait right here.

00:10:51.100 --> 00:10:52.669 align:middle line:90%
I stepped around the corner.

00:10:52.669 --> 00:10:54.210 align:middle line:84%
And I used a technique
that I'm going

00:10:54.210 --> 00:10:55.950 align:middle line:84%
to share with you
in just a moment,

00:10:55.950 --> 00:10:58.170 align:middle line:84%
because my brain was
spinning with all kinds

00:10:58.170 --> 00:10:58.970 align:middle line:90%
of possibilities.

00:10:58.970 --> 00:11:00.303 align:middle line:90%
Did she know something I didn't?

00:11:00.303 --> 00:11:03.090 align:middle line:84%
Did TSA say something,
or air traffic control,

00:11:03.090 --> 00:11:05.104 align:middle line:90%
or was something else going on?

00:11:05.104 --> 00:11:07.020 align:middle line:10%
And I know you all have
had these experiences,

00:11:07.020 --> 00:11:12.120 align:middle line:10%
where something happens in your
life and there's no one to ask,

00:11:12.120 --> 00:11:13.530 align:middle line:10%
because no one knows the answer.

00:11:13.530 --> 00:11:15.120 align:middle line:84%
And everyone that
you do ask is going

00:11:15.120 --> 00:11:16.707 align:middle line:90%
to give you a different answer.

00:11:16.707 --> 00:11:18.540 align:middle line:84%
You see this happen all
the time with people

00:11:18.540 --> 00:11:20.181 align:middle line:90%
that have a health crisis.

00:11:20.181 --> 00:11:21.930 align:middle line:84%
And the doctor wants
them to do one thing,

00:11:21.930 --> 00:11:23.304 align:middle line:84%
and they've got
a million friends

00:11:23.304 --> 00:11:25.290 align:middle line:84%
giving them a million
alternative ways

00:11:25.290 --> 00:11:27.976 align:middle line:90%
to heal naturally or herbally.

00:11:27.976 --> 00:11:29.100 align:middle line:90%
And their head is spinning.

00:11:29.100 --> 00:11:30.750 align:middle line:84%
And they say, I don't
know what to do,

00:11:30.750 --> 00:11:32.320 align:middle line:84%
because there is
no right and wrong.

00:11:32.320 --> 00:11:33.600 align:middle line:90%
And there's no one to ask.

00:11:33.600 --> 00:11:36.180 align:middle line:84%
All we have is
ourselves and our heart.

00:11:36.180 --> 00:11:38.970 align:middle line:84%
So what I did, stepped
around the corner.

00:11:38.970 --> 00:11:42.060 align:middle line:84%
I began communicating
with my heart in the way

00:11:42.060 --> 00:11:44.070 align:middle line:84%
that I've learned through
heart-brain harmony

00:11:44.070 --> 00:11:47.340 align:middle line:84%
that we're going to do
here, in just a moment.

00:11:47.340 --> 00:11:50.880 align:middle line:84%
And I got a very clear
sense-- and it's amazing

00:11:50.880 --> 00:11:54.360 align:middle line:84%
how crystal-clear the
information from our heart

00:11:54.360 --> 00:11:56.160 align:middle line:90%
becomes when we do this.

00:11:56.160 --> 00:11:59.100 align:middle line:84%
Let me just give you a
couple of indications.

00:11:59.100 --> 00:12:00.720 align:middle line:84%
When your heart is
speaking to you,

00:12:00.720 --> 00:12:05.730 align:middle line:84%
your heart speaks briefly,
concisely, usually in a phrase

00:12:05.730 --> 00:12:07.440 align:middle line:90%
or in a single sentence.

00:12:07.440 --> 00:12:09.400 align:middle line:84%
Rarely-- I'm not
going to say never,

00:12:09.400 --> 00:12:12.780 align:middle line:84%
because everyone's different--
rarely will your heart begin

00:12:12.780 --> 00:12:15.690 align:middle line:84%
to tell you a story
and a big preamble

00:12:15.690 --> 00:12:19.080 align:middle line:84%
to justify the answer that
it's about to give to you.

00:12:19.080 --> 00:12:21.024 align:middle line:84%
So if you ask a
question from within--

00:12:21.024 --> 00:12:23.190 align:middle line:84%
what does this dream mean,
or should I get onto this

00:12:23.190 --> 00:12:26.220 align:middle line:84%
airplane, or should I follow
this medical procedure--

00:12:26.220 --> 00:12:28.620 align:middle line:84%
and you start to hear a
story-- well, you know,

00:12:28.620 --> 00:12:31.740 align:middle line:84%
when I was five years old,
I had this experience, and--

00:12:31.740 --> 00:12:33.800 align:middle line:84%
probably, probably
that's not your heart.

00:12:33.800 --> 00:12:36.780 align:middle line:84%
It's probably
something in your mind,

00:12:36.780 --> 00:12:39.110 align:middle line:84%
your logic, or
your ego that feels

00:12:39.110 --> 00:12:40.560 align:middle line:90%
it needs to justify the answer.

00:12:40.560 --> 00:12:42.270 align:middle line:90%
Heart would never do that.

00:12:42.270 --> 00:12:44.400 align:middle line:90%
So I went through a process.

00:12:44.400 --> 00:12:46.064 align:middle line:84%
I felt it was OK to
get on that plane.

00:12:46.064 --> 00:12:47.730 align:middle line:84%
I got on the plane,
I had a great flight

00:12:47.730 --> 00:12:49.260 align:middle line:90%
back to Los Angeles.

00:12:49.260 --> 00:12:51.180 align:middle line:84%
I came back to a very
different country

00:12:51.180 --> 00:12:53.610 align:middle line:84%
from the one I had
left 10 days earlier.

00:12:53.610 --> 00:12:55.245 align:middle line:84%
But the point is, it
was a safe flight.

00:12:55.245 --> 00:12:56.045 align:middle line:90%
It was good.

00:12:56.045 --> 00:12:58.310 align:middle line:84%
And if I'd listened
to my fears, I

00:12:58.310 --> 00:13:00.990 align:middle line:84%
may have delayed coming
back days or maybe weeks,

00:13:00.990 --> 00:13:03.600 align:middle line:84%
because there was so
much fear around this.

00:13:03.600 --> 00:13:06.210 align:middle line:84%
Only by listening
to our hearts--

00:13:06.210 --> 00:13:08.970 align:middle line:84%
now, this is one
facet of intuition.

00:13:08.970 --> 00:13:11.970 align:middle line:84%
And I've just shared
a couple of these,

00:13:11.970 --> 00:13:14.430 align:middle line:84%
knowing about
partnerships, knowing

00:13:14.430 --> 00:13:16.570 align:middle line:90%
when something is right for us.

00:13:16.570 --> 00:13:18.690 align:middle line:84%
There's another kind
of intuition, very fast

00:13:18.690 --> 00:13:20.130 align:middle line:90%
information processing.

00:13:20.130 --> 00:13:23.910 align:middle line:84%
And I alluded to it
in a previous episode,

00:13:23.910 --> 00:13:25.800 align:middle line:90%
in the last episode.

00:13:25.800 --> 00:13:28.440 align:middle line:84%
And I'd like to just share a
little bit more about this,

00:13:28.440 --> 00:13:31.020 align:middle line:90%
just to clarify what I'm saying.

00:13:31.020 --> 00:13:36.630 align:middle line:84%
Interestingly, it took the
most sophisticated research

00:13:36.630 --> 00:13:41.100 align:middle line:84%
of the most modern equipment,
and using that equipment

00:13:41.100 --> 00:13:44.460 align:middle line:84%
on some of the most ancient and
primitive practices of Tibetan

00:13:44.460 --> 00:13:48.450 align:middle line:84%
monks, for scientists to
begin to understand how

00:13:48.450 --> 00:13:50.610 align:middle line:90%
this form of intuition works.

00:13:50.610 --> 00:13:54.030 align:middle line:84%
And it works by using
a brain state that

00:13:54.030 --> 00:13:56.895 align:middle line:84%
used to not even show up
in the pages of a textbook.

00:13:56.895 --> 00:13:59.270 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to invite you to
look at your screen right now.

00:13:59.270 --> 00:14:01.710 align:middle line:84%
And I'm going to talk about
brain states just for a moment.

00:14:01.710 --> 00:14:02.850 align:middle line:84%
What you're seeing
on your screen

00:14:02.850 --> 00:14:04.265 align:middle line:84%
are the traditional
brain states,

00:14:04.265 --> 00:14:07.140 align:middle line:84%
at the very bottom of the
screen-- the delta waves, long,

00:14:07.140 --> 00:14:08.876 align:middle line:90%
slow waves.

00:14:08.876 --> 00:14:10.500 align:middle line:84%
And these are when
we're deeply asleep.

00:14:10.500 --> 00:14:11.875 align:middle line:84%
And then the theta
waves, when we

00:14:11.875 --> 00:14:14.715 align:middle line:84%
become drowsy; the
alpha waves, where

00:14:14.715 --> 00:14:18.020 align:middle line:84%
we're more relaxed and
maybe in meditation;

00:14:18.020 --> 00:14:20.640 align:middle line:84%
the beta waves-- this is where,
maybe, you are right now,

00:14:20.640 --> 00:14:23.547 align:middle line:84%
when we're busily engaged
in daily activities.

00:14:23.547 --> 00:14:25.380 align:middle line:84%
This used to be the end
of the brain states.

00:14:25.380 --> 00:14:28.140 align:middle line:84%
But there is another brain
state that scientists

00:14:28.140 --> 00:14:31.150 align:middle line:84%
are working with now, and
it is above the beta wave.

00:14:31.150 --> 00:14:33.570 align:middle line:10%
It is called gamma.

00:14:33.570 --> 00:14:34.770 align:middle line:10%
This is the gamma state.

00:14:34.770 --> 00:14:38.520 align:middle line:84%
And look at how much faster
and how much more compressed

00:14:38.520 --> 00:14:40.540 align:middle line:90%
these brain waves are.

00:14:40.540 --> 00:14:43.140 align:middle line:84%
Well, interestingly,
these are the brainwaves

00:14:43.140 --> 00:14:46.470 align:middle line:84%
that the Tibetan monks were
creating in their bodies

00:14:46.470 --> 00:14:49.800 align:middle line:84%
intentionally, on
demand, to accomplish

00:14:49.800 --> 00:14:55.170 align:middle line:84%
the amazing feats of healing,
of awareness, of intuition.

00:14:55.170 --> 00:14:58.410 align:middle line:10%
They're able to regulate their
body functions, their body

00:14:58.410 --> 00:15:00.360 align:middle line:10%
temperatures, their
immune response,

00:15:00.360 --> 00:15:05.510 align:middle line:10%
their anti-aging hormones, all
on demand, when they choose.

00:15:05.510 --> 00:15:08.250 align:middle line:84%
And this is where
they find their power,

00:15:08.250 --> 00:15:10.660 align:middle line:90%
by realizing this potential.

00:15:10.660 --> 00:15:14.160 align:middle line:84%
So I'm sharing this with you
now because, interestingly

00:15:14.160 --> 00:15:16.320 align:middle line:84%
and perhaps not
surprisingly, it is

00:15:16.320 --> 00:15:19.080 align:middle line:84%
by harmonizing the
heart and the brain

00:15:19.080 --> 00:15:21.740 align:middle line:84%
that we achieve
this gamma state--

00:15:21.740 --> 00:15:23.700 align:middle line:84%
one of the ways that
we can achieve it--

00:15:23.700 --> 00:15:27.270 align:middle line:84%
that we achieve this
gamma state intentionally.

00:15:27.270 --> 00:15:30.780 align:middle line:84%
And when we create
the gamma state,

00:15:30.780 --> 00:15:32.850 align:middle line:84%
one of the first things
that scientists say to us

00:15:32.850 --> 00:15:35.040 align:middle line:84%
is it opens the door
to precisely what we've

00:15:35.040 --> 00:15:36.360 align:middle line:90%
been talking about--

00:15:36.360 --> 00:15:38.850 align:middle line:90%
to states of deep intuition.

00:15:38.850 --> 00:15:40.890 align:middle line:84%
It opens the door
to increased focus,

00:15:40.890 --> 00:15:44.880 align:middle line:84%
where we can recall everything
about any memorable event.

00:15:44.880 --> 00:15:47.520 align:middle line:84%
This sounds like some of
the very popular television

00:15:47.520 --> 00:15:51.990 align:middle line:84%
programs, where individuals are
trained to become superhumans.

00:15:51.990 --> 00:15:53.490 align:middle line:84%
And they walk into
a room and boom,

00:15:53.490 --> 00:15:55.500 align:middle line:84%
they know everything
about everyone

00:15:55.500 --> 00:15:58.170 align:middle line:90%
in that room, total recall.

00:15:58.170 --> 00:16:00.420 align:middle line:84%
The gamma state
is what allows us

00:16:00.420 --> 00:16:05.940 align:middle line:84%
very fast processing of storage,
and information, and retrieval.

00:16:05.940 --> 00:16:07.860 align:middle line:84%
And it actually
makes a lot of sense

00:16:07.860 --> 00:16:09.780 align:middle line:84%
that we would be
able to do that.

00:16:09.780 --> 00:16:13.100 align:middle line:84%
When you think about fast
information retrieval

00:16:13.100 --> 00:16:15.520 align:middle line:84%
and involving the heart, if
you really think about it,

00:16:15.520 --> 00:16:18.610 align:middle line:84%
this makes tremendous
sense for this reason.

00:16:18.610 --> 00:16:22.770 align:middle line:84%
When we process information
solely in the brain, when

00:16:22.770 --> 00:16:25.770 align:middle line:84%
you ask your brain a
question, the answers

00:16:25.770 --> 00:16:27.415 align:middle line:90%
generally are a little slower.

00:16:27.415 --> 00:16:29.040 align:middle line:84%
And as I mentioned
before, in the heart

00:16:29.040 --> 00:16:31.290 align:middle line:84%
they're, boom, almost
instantaneously.

00:16:31.290 --> 00:16:33.630 align:middle line:84%
Often, when we ask
our heart a question,

00:16:33.630 --> 00:16:37.110 align:middle line:84%
it answers before we
finish asking the question.

00:16:37.110 --> 00:16:39.120 align:middle line:84%
And the reason makes
a lot of sense.

00:16:39.120 --> 00:16:43.620 align:middle line:84%
It's because the brain,
before it gives us the answer,

00:16:43.620 --> 00:16:49.380 align:middle line:84%
goes through all of the loops
of the logic, the fears,

00:16:49.380 --> 00:16:55.470 align:middle line:84%
the issues that have
come up in the past,

00:16:55.470 --> 00:17:00.060 align:middle line:84%
the issues of self-doubt,
the issues of self-esteem.

00:17:00.060 --> 00:17:02.580 align:middle line:84%
All of those things,
those are the logic loops

00:17:02.580 --> 00:17:04.950 align:middle line:84%
that the brain goes
through, the filters,

00:17:04.950 --> 00:17:06.410 align:middle line:90%
before it gives us an answer.

00:17:06.410 --> 00:17:07.449 align:middle line:90%
Heart doesn't do that.

00:17:07.449 --> 00:17:09.240 align:middle line:84%
Heart, you ask your
heart a question, boom,

00:17:09.240 --> 00:17:11.099 align:middle line:90%
it gives you the answer.

00:17:11.099 --> 00:17:16.410 align:middle line:84%
Part of my heritage is
Native American, is Cherokee.

00:17:16.410 --> 00:17:19.050 align:middle line:84%
And in the Cherokee tradition,
as well as in some others

00:17:19.050 --> 00:17:22.410 align:middle line:84%
in the Midwest of
the United States,

00:17:22.410 --> 00:17:25.740 align:middle line:84%
our indigenous ancestors knew
of this power of the heart.

00:17:25.740 --> 00:17:27.911 align:middle line:84%
And they actually
gave it a name.

00:17:27.911 --> 00:17:32.610 align:middle line:84%
And this is one of the things--
there is no English translation

00:17:32.610 --> 00:17:34.690 align:middle line:90%
specifically for this name.

00:17:34.690 --> 00:17:38.370 align:middle line:84%
There is no single
English word that

00:17:38.370 --> 00:17:41.490 align:middle line:84%
means precisely what
the Native words mean.

00:17:41.490 --> 00:17:45.060 align:middle line:84%
So we have to create English
words around it, like prana.

00:17:45.060 --> 00:17:48.600 align:middle line:84%
When we say the word prana,
that is a Sanskrit word.

00:17:48.600 --> 00:17:50.880 align:middle line:84%
There is no English
word that means prana.

00:17:50.880 --> 00:17:52.540 align:middle line:84%
So we have to create
some other words.

00:17:52.540 --> 00:17:57.690 align:middle line:84%
We say energy body or life force
to approximate what it means.

00:17:57.690 --> 00:18:01.200 align:middle line:84%
Well, same things happen
with the wisdom of the heart.

00:18:01.200 --> 00:18:06.060 align:middle line:84%
And the word that's used is
called [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH],

00:18:06.060 --> 00:18:07.370 align:middle line:90%
[NON-ENGLISH SPEECH].

00:18:07.370 --> 00:18:11.200 align:middle line:84%
And it means the single
eye of the heart,

00:18:11.200 --> 00:18:15.300 align:middle line:84%
the heart that doesn't judge
right, wrong, good, bad.

00:18:15.300 --> 00:18:19.620 align:middle line:10%
The heart can discern what's
true for us and what's not,

00:18:19.620 --> 00:18:22.770 align:middle line:10%
yet it does not
assign a judgment.

00:18:22.770 --> 00:18:26.130 align:middle line:10%
That's a powerful distinction,
and that will empower you

00:18:26.130 --> 00:18:28.740 align:middle line:10%
in situations, whether
you're in the boardroom,

00:18:28.740 --> 00:18:31.260 align:middle line:10%
or the classroom, or
you're with your friends,

00:18:31.260 --> 00:18:34.680 align:middle line:10%
or in the most intimate
relationships with those that

00:18:34.680 --> 00:18:37.050 align:middle line:10%
are closest to
you, where you tap

00:18:37.050 --> 00:18:39.540 align:middle line:10%
and they know you
well enough to tap

00:18:39.540 --> 00:18:43.290 align:middle line:10%
the buttons and the triggers
that elicit responses

00:18:43.290 --> 00:18:45.385 align:middle line:10%
that sometimes you wish
you hadn't have said.

00:18:45.385 --> 00:18:48.096 align:middle line:84%
If you can get out of your
brain and go into your heart,

00:18:48.096 --> 00:18:50.220 align:middle line:84%
[NON-ENGLISH SPEECH], the
single eye of the heart--

00:18:50.220 --> 00:18:53.040 align:middle line:84%
it'll tell you what's true
for you, and you only.

00:18:53.040 --> 00:18:55.350 align:middle line:84%
It can't tell you what's
true for someone else.

00:18:55.350 --> 00:18:57.690 align:middle line:84%
And it will do it
with discernment.

00:18:57.690 --> 00:19:01.440 align:middle line:84%
So it makes a lot of sense
that the gamma state actually

00:19:01.440 --> 00:19:03.710 align:middle line:84%
allows us this very,
very fast processing.

00:19:03.710 --> 00:19:06.270 align:middle line:84%
The gamma state, also,
when we achieve that,

00:19:06.270 --> 00:19:08.250 align:middle line:90%
it's a natural antidepressant.

00:19:08.250 --> 00:19:10.740 align:middle line:84%
People are happier, and
they're much calmer,

00:19:10.740 --> 00:19:12.480 align:middle line:84%
when they're in
this gamma state.

00:19:12.480 --> 00:19:14.240 align:middle line:90%
And it also awakens.

00:19:14.240 --> 00:19:17.500 align:middle line:84%
It breathes life into
our sensory perception.

00:19:17.500 --> 00:19:21.240 align:middle line:84%
When we're in the gamma state,
we can pick up scents that we

00:19:21.240 --> 00:19:23.190 align:middle line:84%
cannot pick up, typically,
in the beta state.

00:19:23.190 --> 00:19:24.120 align:middle line:90%
You smell things.

00:19:24.120 --> 00:19:25.600 align:middle line:90%
It becomes alive.

00:19:25.600 --> 00:19:28.515 align:middle line:84%
Your sensations of sound--
music feels differently.

00:19:28.515 --> 00:19:30.210 align:middle line:90%
It doesn't just sound.

00:19:30.210 --> 00:19:32.460 align:middle line:90%
It feels differently to you.

00:19:32.460 --> 00:19:34.980 align:middle line:84%
These are all the benefits
of being in the gamma state.

00:19:34.980 --> 00:19:36.771 align:middle line:84%
So I'm saying this to
you now because we're

00:19:36.771 --> 00:19:38.255 align:middle line:84%
about to move into
the gamma state,

00:19:38.255 --> 00:19:41.190 align:middle line:84%
and I want you to know
all the benefits that

00:19:41.190 --> 00:19:43.590 align:middle line:90%
come from doing precisely this.

00:19:43.590 --> 00:19:47.070 align:middle line:84%
So we've explored many
of the potentials that

00:19:47.070 --> 00:19:51.510 align:middle line:84%
come from awakening this
marriage, this union

00:19:51.510 --> 00:19:52.945 align:middle line:90%
between the heart and the brain.

00:19:52.945 --> 00:19:53.820 align:middle line:90%
And there are others.

00:19:53.820 --> 00:19:56.170 align:middle line:84%
We're just barely
scratching the surface.

00:19:56.170 --> 00:19:58.350 align:middle line:84%
But what I'd like
to do now is share

00:19:58.350 --> 00:20:01.140 align:middle line:84%
with you a technique,
a technique so

00:20:01.140 --> 00:20:04.890 align:middle line:84%
that you can tap these
potentials in your life

00:20:04.890 --> 00:20:06.619 align:middle line:90%
when you choose to do so.

00:20:06.619 --> 00:20:08.910 align:middle line:84%
What scientists know is that
every moment of every day,

00:20:08.910 --> 00:20:10.850 align:middle line:84%
as I mentioned, there's
this conversation.

00:20:10.850 --> 00:20:13.590 align:middle line:84%
It's a conversation between
the heart and the brain.

00:20:13.590 --> 00:20:15.720 align:middle line:84%
The heart is speaking
to the brain.

00:20:15.720 --> 00:20:18.260 align:middle line:84%
And the quality of
the conversation

00:20:18.260 --> 00:20:19.890 align:middle line:84%
that comes from the
heart and the brain

00:20:19.890 --> 00:20:23.560 align:middle line:84%
tells the brain what chemistry
to release into the body.

00:20:23.560 --> 00:20:27.060 align:middle line:84%
So for example, when we're
feeling emotions that we would

00:20:27.060 --> 00:20:29.110 align:middle line:90%
typically consider negative--

00:20:29.110 --> 00:20:32.340 align:middle line:84%
and I don't like to
characterize emotions

00:20:32.340 --> 00:20:33.360 align:middle line:90%
as negative or positive.

00:20:33.360 --> 00:20:35.485 align:middle line:84%
But I'm doing this so that
you get a sense for what

00:20:35.485 --> 00:20:36.510 align:middle line:90%
we're doing here.

00:20:36.510 --> 00:20:40.230 align:middle line:84%
When we have emotions such
as anger, hate, jealousy,

00:20:40.230 --> 00:20:43.320 align:middle line:84%
rage, what you're
seeing on your screen

00:20:43.320 --> 00:20:47.520 align:middle line:84%
is an actual printout of
the quality of the signal

00:20:47.520 --> 00:20:48.690 align:middle line:90%
from the heart to the brain.

00:20:48.690 --> 00:20:50.520 align:middle line:84%
And you can see,
it's very chaotic.

00:20:50.520 --> 00:20:52.170 align:middle line:90%
It's a very jagged signal.

00:20:52.170 --> 00:20:53.520 align:middle line:90%
It's a rough signal.

00:20:53.520 --> 00:20:56.670 align:middle line:84%
And it's that chaotic,
jagged, rough signal

00:20:56.670 --> 00:21:00.450 align:middle line:84%
that signals chaotic
chemistry in your brain.

00:21:00.450 --> 00:21:03.150 align:middle line:84%
This is the kind of
chemistry that tells us

00:21:03.150 --> 00:21:06.330 align:middle line:84%
that we need high amounts
of adrenaline, high amounts

00:21:06.330 --> 00:21:09.450 align:middle line:84%
of cortisol, the stress
hormones to respond to something

00:21:09.450 --> 00:21:10.500 align:middle line:90%
quickly in life.

00:21:10.500 --> 00:21:12.252 align:middle line:84%
That's a good thing
for a few moments.

00:21:12.252 --> 00:21:14.460 align:middle line:84%
You don't want to live your
life, day in and day out,

00:21:14.460 --> 00:21:15.990 align:middle line:90%
like this.

00:21:15.990 --> 00:21:18.030 align:middle line:10%
The next image
that you're seeing

00:21:18.030 --> 00:21:21.390 align:middle line:10%
is what happens
when we can shift

00:21:21.390 --> 00:21:26.010 align:middle line:10%
our heart-based experiences from
things like frustration, anger,

00:21:26.010 --> 00:21:30.600 align:middle line:10%
hate, jealousy, and rage
to things like compassion,

00:21:30.600 --> 00:21:35.160 align:middle line:10%
care for anything,
gratitude for anything,

00:21:35.160 --> 00:21:37.370 align:middle line:10%
appreciation for anything.

00:21:37.370 --> 00:21:40.350 align:middle line:84%
And when we can do that,
very, very quickly,

00:21:40.350 --> 00:21:43.200 align:middle line:84%
this signal from the
heart to the brain shifts.

00:21:43.200 --> 00:21:46.950 align:middle line:84%
And you're seeing that it
becomes a very rhythmic, very

00:21:46.950 --> 00:21:49.240 align:middle line:90%
even, very coherent signal.

00:21:49.240 --> 00:21:50.650 align:middle line:90%
This is what it's called.

00:21:50.650 --> 00:21:52.650 align:middle line:84%
And it sends a different
signal to our brain,

00:21:52.650 --> 00:21:55.230 align:middle line:84%
and our brain begins to
release a different chemistry

00:21:55.230 --> 00:21:56.520 align:middle line:90%
into our bodies.

00:21:56.520 --> 00:21:59.160 align:middle line:84%
Now, I'm saying this to you now
because I want you to know that

00:21:59.160 --> 00:22:01.360 align:middle line:84%
your brain cannot do both
things at the same time.

00:22:01.360 --> 00:22:03.130 align:middle line:90%
It can only do one or the other.

00:22:03.130 --> 00:22:05.970 align:middle line:84%
So when you are in
coherent feeling

00:22:05.970 --> 00:22:09.390 align:middle line:84%
and that even rhythm, that's
what awakens your brain

00:22:09.390 --> 00:22:12.000 align:middle line:84%
to send powerful
healing chemistry,

00:22:12.000 --> 00:22:15.900 align:middle line:84%
powerful immune response,
powerful anti-aging hormones,

00:22:15.900 --> 00:22:19.200 align:middle line:84%
awakens your senses,
turns on that gamma, OK?

00:22:19.200 --> 00:22:22.640 align:middle line:84%
And when you are in the
rough, jagged signal,

00:22:22.640 --> 00:22:24.370 align:middle line:90%
that's fight or flight.

00:22:24.370 --> 00:22:27.180 align:middle line:84%
Your body and your brain are
saying something important

00:22:27.180 --> 00:22:28.120 align:middle line:90%
is happening.

00:22:28.120 --> 00:22:32.350 align:middle line:84%
We've got to run or fight, so
we don't have time for healing.

00:22:32.350 --> 00:22:34.110 align:middle line:84%
We don't have time for
an immune response.

00:22:34.110 --> 00:22:36.150 align:middle line:84%
We don't have time for
anti-aging hormones.

00:22:36.150 --> 00:22:37.350 align:middle line:90%
They're not important.

00:22:37.350 --> 00:22:42.930 align:middle line:84%
So it shuts off those functions
in preferential treatment

00:22:42.930 --> 00:22:45.820 align:middle line:90%
of this fight or flight.

00:22:45.820 --> 00:22:48.760 align:middle line:84%
So for this reason, you can
see why fight or flight's good

00:22:48.760 --> 00:22:49.560 align:middle line:90%
momentarily.

00:22:49.560 --> 00:22:52.410 align:middle line:90%
You don't want it long term.

00:22:52.410 --> 00:22:55.737 align:middle line:84%
We can shift these brain
states very, very quickly.

00:22:55.737 --> 00:22:57.195 align:middle line:84%
And what I'd like
to do now is, I'm

00:22:57.195 --> 00:23:00.840 align:middle line:84%
going to share a technique
with you to help to do this.

00:23:00.840 --> 00:23:04.080 align:middle line:84%
We can measure this conversation
between the heart and the brain

00:23:04.080 --> 00:23:05.550 align:middle line:90%
electrically.

00:23:05.550 --> 00:23:08.370 align:middle line:84%
And it is a very low
frequency, so this

00:23:08.370 --> 00:23:12.960 align:middle line:84%
isn't an esoteric essence
of a prana or aura.

00:23:12.960 --> 00:23:16.200 align:middle line:84%
This is an electrical
and a magnetic frequency.

00:23:16.200 --> 00:23:20.370 align:middle line:84%
And the electrical part is
a very, very low frequency.

00:23:20.370 --> 00:23:23.340 align:middle line:90%
It is 0.1 hertz.

00:23:23.340 --> 00:23:24.680 align:middle line:90%
It's not even 1--

00:23:24.680 --> 00:23:26.849 align:middle line:90%
0.1 hertz.

00:23:26.849 --> 00:23:29.140 align:middle line:84%
This is such a low frequency,
you can't even hear this.

00:23:29.140 --> 00:23:33.220 align:middle line:84%
It is right on the threshold
between feeling and hearing.

00:23:33.220 --> 00:23:37.340 align:middle line:84%
It's a frequency that whales use
to communicate in the oceans,

00:23:37.340 --> 00:23:39.400 align:middle line:84%
so it's a very
universal frequency.

00:23:39.400 --> 00:23:41.680 align:middle line:84%
It's also a frequency
that military submarines

00:23:41.680 --> 00:23:43.390 align:middle line:84%
use to communicate
in the oceans, which

00:23:43.390 --> 00:23:46.430 align:middle line:84%
is why it's a problem for
the whales when they use it.

00:23:46.430 --> 00:23:49.870 align:middle line:84%
And it is the optimal
signal to harmonize

00:23:49.870 --> 00:23:51.580 align:middle line:90%
your heart and your brain.

00:23:51.580 --> 00:23:54.820 align:middle line:84%
So what this means is if
you can create a feeling

00:23:54.820 --> 00:23:59.710 align:middle line:84%
in your heart of 0.1
hertz, then that feeling

00:23:59.710 --> 00:24:02.780 align:middle line:84%
is going to harmonize
your heart and your brain.

00:24:02.780 --> 00:24:05.410 align:middle line:84%
Now, in indigenous traditions
that I've been with,

00:24:05.410 --> 00:24:07.840 align:middle line:90%
they have techniques to do this.

00:24:07.840 --> 00:24:10.150 align:middle line:84%
The Institute of
HeartMath that I mentioned

00:24:10.150 --> 00:24:14.530 align:middle line:84%
in the last episode, they
have refined these techniques

00:24:14.530 --> 00:24:17.380 align:middle line:84%
in the laboratory into
very, very simple steps that

00:24:17.380 --> 00:24:20.650 align:middle line:84%
make them accessible in
our everyday environment,

00:24:20.650 --> 00:24:22.614 align:middle line:84%
whether we're in an
urban environment,

00:24:22.614 --> 00:24:24.280 align:middle line:84%
whether we're in a
military environment,

00:24:24.280 --> 00:24:27.040 align:middle line:90%
a first-responder environment.

00:24:27.040 --> 00:24:29.320 align:middle line:84%
This technique has been used
in all these environments

00:24:29.320 --> 00:24:31.120 align:middle line:90%
that I'm mentioning now--

00:24:31.120 --> 00:24:34.570 align:middle line:84%
in family, in marriage and
family counseling environments,

00:24:34.570 --> 00:24:37.780 align:middle line:84%
in cardiac environments
to help deal

00:24:37.780 --> 00:24:40.840 align:middle line:84%
with blood pressure
and cardiac events

00:24:40.840 --> 00:24:42.940 align:middle line:84%
that are happening
within our bodies.

00:24:42.940 --> 00:24:45.250 align:middle line:84%
So there are a vast
and myriad number

00:24:45.250 --> 00:24:48.280 align:middle line:84%
of applications for
the one technique

00:24:48.280 --> 00:24:50.020 align:middle line:84%
that we're going
to do right now.

00:24:50.020 --> 00:24:54.070 align:middle line:84%
And this technique is the
doorway for all the potentials

00:24:54.070 --> 00:24:55.800 align:middle line:90%
that we have just listed.

00:24:55.800 --> 00:24:59.020 align:middle line:84%
By achieving heart-brain
coherence, it opens the door,

00:24:59.020 --> 00:25:00.700 align:middle line:90%
and we get to choose.

00:25:00.700 --> 00:25:02.800 align:middle line:84%
It's like once we're
in this place, now

00:25:02.800 --> 00:25:04.930 align:middle line:84%
we can do this,
this, this, or this.

00:25:04.930 --> 00:25:06.310 align:middle line:90%
We can do subconscious.

00:25:06.310 --> 00:25:08.110 align:middle line:90%
We can go into intuition.

00:25:08.110 --> 00:25:11.530 align:middle line:84%
We can simply use this technique
before we go to bed at night,

00:25:11.530 --> 00:25:15.220 align:middle line:84%
to begin to sleep and trigger
a healing within our bodies.

00:25:15.220 --> 00:25:17.050 align:middle line:84%
We can do it first
thing in the morning.

00:25:17.050 --> 00:25:18.359 align:middle line:90%
We can do it before our yoga.

00:25:18.359 --> 00:25:19.900 align:middle line:84%
We can do it before
our martial arts.

00:25:19.900 --> 00:25:23.350 align:middle line:84%
We can do it before our qi
gong, our healing practice,

00:25:23.350 --> 00:25:26.950 align:middle line:84%
any of these things, because
everything goes better

00:25:26.950 --> 00:25:28.870 align:middle line:90%
with heart-brain coherence.

00:25:28.870 --> 00:25:30.580 align:middle line:84%
And that's all we're
doing, is we're

00:25:30.580 --> 00:25:33.010 align:middle line:84%
optimizing the conversation
between the heart

00:25:33.010 --> 00:25:36.500 align:middle line:84%
and the brain, between
your heart and your brain.

00:25:36.500 --> 00:25:38.230 align:middle line:90%
So how do we do this?

00:25:38.230 --> 00:25:44.440 align:middle line:84%
Three steps-- the first step is
to simply shift your awareness

00:25:44.440 --> 00:25:46.900 align:middle line:90%
from your mind into your heart.

00:25:46.900 --> 00:25:49.020 align:middle line:84%
And what I've found is,
in the Western traditions,

00:25:49.020 --> 00:25:51.615 align:middle line:84%
for many people that's
easier said than done.

00:25:51.615 --> 00:25:53.240 align:middle line:84%
I'll ask people, are
you in your heart?

00:25:53.240 --> 00:25:53.640 align:middle line:90%
And they'll say, yep.

00:25:53.640 --> 00:25:54.730 align:middle line:90%
I'm in my heart.

00:25:54.730 --> 00:25:55.850 align:middle line:84%
But what they are
really doing is,

00:25:55.850 --> 00:25:57.391 align:middle line:84%
they're still in
their brain thinking

00:25:57.391 --> 00:25:59.800 align:middle line:84%
about what it would be like
if they were in their heart.

00:25:59.800 --> 00:26:03.160 align:middle line:84%
This is where the indigenous
traditions come in.

00:26:03.160 --> 00:26:04.659 align:middle line:90%
Our ancestors told us--

00:26:04.659 --> 00:26:06.700 align:middle line:84%
and when I spend time with
my indigenous friends,

00:26:06.700 --> 00:26:08.740 align:middle line:90%
I say, how do you guys do this?

00:26:08.740 --> 00:26:12.130 align:middle line:84%
And they say, it helps if you
can gently touch your heart

00:26:12.130 --> 00:26:16.740 align:middle line:84%
center, physically, in a way
that's comfortable for you.

00:26:16.740 --> 00:26:19.630 align:middle line:84%
In the Mayan traditions
you see an open palm right

00:26:19.630 --> 00:26:20.430 align:middle line:90%
on the heart.

00:26:20.430 --> 00:26:22.138 align:middle line:84%
In many of the Middle
Eastern traditions,

00:26:22.138 --> 00:26:24.220 align:middle line:90%
you see the same thing.

00:26:24.220 --> 00:26:27.200 align:middle line:84%
In the Buddhist traditions
you see a prayer mudra

00:26:27.200 --> 00:26:29.560 align:middle line:84%
that physically
touches the sternum.

00:26:29.560 --> 00:26:33.250 align:middle line:84%
The key is any of
those things creates

00:26:33.250 --> 00:26:37.150 align:middle line:84%
a gentle touch, a
physical sensation,

00:26:37.150 --> 00:26:38.740 align:middle line:90%
right over the heart center.

00:26:38.740 --> 00:26:41.260 align:middle line:84%
And your awareness will
always go to the place

00:26:41.260 --> 00:26:42.730 align:middle line:90%
where you feel the sensation.

00:26:42.730 --> 00:26:43.970 align:middle line:90%
That's the key.

00:26:43.970 --> 00:26:46.120 align:middle line:84%
So if you can create a
touch over your heart,

00:26:46.120 --> 00:26:48.110 align:middle line:84%
your awareness will
go there-- first step.

00:26:48.110 --> 00:26:50.470 align:middle line:90%
Second step, very simple--

00:26:50.470 --> 00:26:54.130 align:middle line:84%
slow your breathing a little
bit slower than typical,

00:26:54.130 --> 00:26:58.190 align:middle line:84%
maybe five seconds inhale,
five seconds exhale.

00:26:58.190 --> 00:27:01.360 align:middle line:84%
And here's why that's powerful--
because the only time you would

00:27:01.360 --> 00:27:04.420 align:middle line:84%
ever slow your breathing
and breathe in that way

00:27:04.420 --> 00:27:08.800 align:middle line:84%
is when you feel safe,
when you feel that you're

00:27:08.800 --> 00:27:11.470 align:middle line:84%
in a place that's safe,
and you're not threatened,

00:27:11.470 --> 00:27:14.170 align:middle line:84%
and you're not vigilant
of your surroundings.

00:27:14.170 --> 00:27:16.980 align:middle line:84%
So you're telling your body
you're in a place that's safe.

00:27:16.980 --> 00:27:18.640 align:middle line:90%
Slow your breathing.

00:27:18.640 --> 00:27:21.290 align:middle line:84%
Third step, and
this is the key, is

00:27:21.290 --> 00:27:26.580 align:middle line:84%
to begin to feel the feeling
that creates 0.1 hertz.

00:27:26.580 --> 00:27:29.580 align:middle line:84%
Feel the feeling that
sets up the coherence

00:27:29.580 --> 00:27:31.630 align:middle line:84%
between your heart
and your brain.

00:27:31.630 --> 00:27:32.970 align:middle line:90%
How do we do that?

00:27:32.970 --> 00:27:33.950 align:middle line:90%
I gave it away earlier.

00:27:33.950 --> 00:27:36.000 align:middle line:90%
I've already mentioned it.

00:27:36.000 --> 00:27:38.860 align:middle line:84%
Scientists have found-- at
the Institute of HeartMath,

00:27:38.860 --> 00:27:43.050 align:middle line:84%
their researchers have found
that there are four key words

00:27:43.050 --> 00:27:47.640 align:middle line:84%
that work almost 100% of
the time for everyone--

00:27:47.640 --> 00:27:51.510 align:middle line:84%
appreciation for
anything or anyone,

00:27:51.510 --> 00:27:57.990 align:middle line:84%
gratitude for anything or
anyone, care, and compassion.

00:27:57.990 --> 00:28:01.560 align:middle line:84%
If you can feel one or some
combination of those feelings

00:28:01.560 --> 00:28:04.770 align:middle line:84%
in your heart, while you're
breathing as if your breath is

00:28:04.770 --> 00:28:08.430 align:middle line:84%
coming from your heart,
touching your heart center,

00:28:08.430 --> 00:28:11.130 align:middle line:84%
now you're setting up this
communication between the heart

00:28:11.130 --> 00:28:11.990 align:middle line:90%
and the brain.

00:28:11.990 --> 00:28:15.690 align:middle line:84%
Now you are triggering
those neurons

00:28:15.690 --> 00:28:18.840 align:middle line:84%
to begin to reach out and find
other neurons to strengthen

00:28:18.840 --> 00:28:20.250 align:middle line:90%
this connection.

00:28:20.250 --> 00:28:21.930 align:middle line:84%
And that's why-- I
mentioned before--

00:28:21.930 --> 00:28:26.010 align:middle line:84%
it takes about 72 hours, 3
days to build these networks.

00:28:26.010 --> 00:28:27.750 align:middle line:84%
So that means the
more you do what

00:28:27.750 --> 00:28:30.780 align:middle line:84%
we're about to do right now,
the stronger this connection

00:28:30.780 --> 00:28:32.700 align:middle line:90%
becomes in your life.

00:28:32.700 --> 00:28:34.120 align:middle line:90%
Let's try this.

00:28:34.120 --> 00:28:36.210 align:middle line:90%
Let's go through this together.

00:28:36.210 --> 00:28:39.492 align:middle line:84%
And this is the way we're going
to close out our segment today.

00:28:39.492 --> 00:28:41.700 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to invite you
first to shift your awareness

00:28:41.700 --> 00:28:44.490 align:middle line:84%
from your mind into your heart
by gently touching your heart

00:28:44.490 --> 00:28:45.956 align:middle line:90%
center.

00:28:45.956 --> 00:28:48.804 align:middle line:84%
OK, now once you're
there, breathe

00:28:48.804 --> 00:28:50.220 align:middle line:84%
a little slower
than you typically

00:28:50.220 --> 00:28:55.745 align:middle line:84%
would, maybe five seconds
inhale, five seconds exhale.

00:28:55.745 --> 00:28:59.720 align:middle line:90%


00:28:59.720 --> 00:29:03.060 align:middle line:84%
And as you breathe, feel your
breath coming from your heart.

00:29:03.060 --> 00:29:05.640 align:middle line:84%
And begin to feel
those feelings--

00:29:05.640 --> 00:29:11.016 align:middle line:84%
compassion, gratitude,
care, appreciation

00:29:11.016 --> 00:29:13.390 align:middle line:84%
to the best of your ability,
to the best of your ability.

00:29:13.390 --> 00:29:15.051 align:middle line:90%
And I'm going to do the same.

00:29:15.051 --> 00:29:18.979 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:29:18.979 --> 00:29:28.799 align:middle line:90%


00:29:28.799 --> 00:29:32.140 align:middle line:84%
OK, and what
researchers have found

00:29:32.140 --> 00:29:35.410 align:middle line:84%
is that typically three
minutes, only three minutes,

00:29:35.410 --> 00:29:40.810 align:middle line:84%
of doing what we have just done
will set into motion a cascade

00:29:40.810 --> 00:29:43.750 align:middle line:84%
of events within your
body-- biochemical events

00:29:43.750 --> 00:29:46.180 align:middle line:84%
that will last as
long as six hours.

00:29:46.180 --> 00:29:48.940 align:middle line:84%
The immune response--
the SIgA response,

00:29:48.940 --> 00:29:52.420 align:middle line:84%
first line immune in the white
blood cells of your mouth--

00:29:52.420 --> 00:29:55.810 align:middle line:84%
they are reflecting this
effect for up to six hours

00:29:55.810 --> 00:29:59.830 align:middle line:84%
after you actually
create the experience.

00:29:59.830 --> 00:30:03.066 align:middle line:84%
So I mentioned that we can
do this any time of day.

00:30:03.066 --> 00:30:05.440 align:middle line:84%
You can do it before you sleep
at night, first thing when

00:30:05.440 --> 00:30:07.510 align:middle line:90%
you wake up in the morning.

00:30:07.510 --> 00:30:11.200 align:middle line:84%
This technique, as
simple as it seems,

00:30:11.200 --> 00:30:14.020 align:middle line:84%
is the powerful key
to awaken the greatest

00:30:14.020 --> 00:30:15.270 align:middle line:90%
potential in your life.

00:30:15.270 --> 00:30:18.150 align:middle line:90%


00:30:18.150 --> 00:30:21.180 align:middle line:84%
The simple technique that
we have just experienced,

00:30:21.180 --> 00:30:23.610 align:middle line:84%
it is the key to
our personal power

00:30:23.610 --> 00:30:26.310 align:middle line:84%
and to the doorway of all
the abilities considered

00:30:26.310 --> 00:30:28.110 align:middle line:90%
rare and mystical in the past.

00:30:28.110 --> 00:30:30.060 align:middle line:84%
We don't have to
go to a monastery

00:30:30.060 --> 00:30:32.430 align:middle line:84%
halfway around the
world to learn them.

00:30:32.430 --> 00:30:34.650 align:middle line:84%
In our next episode,
we're going to discover

00:30:34.650 --> 00:30:37.710 align:middle line:84%
how this very technique
is also the key

00:30:37.710 --> 00:30:41.280 align:middle line:84%
to trigger the self-healing
within your body that

00:30:41.280 --> 00:30:44.010 align:middle line:84%
leads to an extended
lifespan, well beyond what's

00:30:44.010 --> 00:30:46.069 align:middle line:90%
traditionally accepted today.

00:30:46.069 --> 00:30:47.610 align:middle line:84%
So I want to thank
you for joining me

00:30:47.610 --> 00:30:49.470 align:middle line:90%
for this very powerful episode.

00:30:49.470 --> 00:30:51.780 align:middle line:84%
And be sure to tune in
for our next all-new

00:30:51.780 --> 00:30:55.350 align:middle line:84%
