>>GREGG BRADEN: My
name is Gregg Braden.

00:00:26.030 --> 00:00:29.330 align:middle line:84%
And I'd like to welcome you to
this very special presentation

00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:33.500 align:middle line:84%
of "Missing Links," The Deep
Truth of Our Origin, History,

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:35.270 align:middle line:90%
Destiny, and Fate.

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:37.460 align:middle line:84%
In our last episode,
we discovered

00:00:37.460 --> 00:00:39.740 align:middle line:84%
the scientific evidence
for intelligent life

00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:42.770 align:middle line:84%
and advanced civilizations
that extended

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:45.800 align:middle line:84%
far back in the geologic
history of the Earth.

00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:47.960 align:middle line:84%
They did it in a way
that simply does not

00:00:47.960 --> 00:00:51.729 align:middle line:84%
fit the traditional
timeline for our past.

00:00:51.729 --> 00:00:54.020 align:middle line:84%
Though the evidence presents
a challenge for mainstream

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:57.680 align:middle line:84%
science to accept, I think
we owe it to ourselves

00:00:57.680 --> 00:01:00.350 align:middle line:84%
to solve those mysteries, the
mysteries that that evidence

00:01:00.350 --> 00:01:02.540 align:middle line:84%
presents, and to
embrace whatever it

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:04.160 align:middle line:90%
is that it means in our lives.

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:06.830 align:middle line:84%
In this episode,
we'll do just that.

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:08.990 align:middle line:84%
We'll explore the
science that's now

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:11.910 align:middle line:84%
confirmed as the
core premise that

00:01:11.910 --> 00:01:16.100 align:middle line:84%
has been at the very foundation
of such ancient civilizations.

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:19.280 align:middle line:84%
And it continues today
among the indigenous peoples

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:21.140 align:middle line:90%
remaining on the Earth.

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:25.760 align:middle line:84%
The question that scientists
have asked for 300 years

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:27.560 align:middle line:90%
appears to be a simple one.

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:30.206 align:middle line:84%
The question is, simply,
are we connected?

00:01:30.206 --> 00:01:32.080 align:middle line:84%
Are we connected to one
another on our Earth?

00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:34.280 align:middle line:84%
Or are we separate from
everything that we know?

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:37.610 align:middle line:84%
And while contemporary
physicists like Professor John

00:01:37.610 --> 00:01:42.110 align:middle line:84%
Wheeler of Princeton University
have no problem accepting

00:01:42.110 --> 00:01:45.170 align:middle line:84%
our intimate connection
with the universe itself,

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:48.380 align:middle line:84%
his friend and colleague
Albert Einstein did.

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:51.170 align:middle line:10%
Before his death,
Albert Einstein

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:55.970 align:middle line:10%
expressed his frustration, his
deep frustration with the idea

00:01:55.970 --> 00:01:58.310 align:middle line:10%
that we maybe live
in a world where

00:01:58.310 --> 00:02:01.970 align:middle line:10%
we're so connected that we
can actually influence matter

00:02:01.970 --> 00:02:04.550 align:middle line:10%
in one place while
we're somewhere else.

00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:08.930 align:middle line:84%
Einstein called this phenomenon
"Spooky Action at a Distance."

00:02:08.930 --> 00:02:13.550 align:middle line:84%
And he did not like the idea of
"Spooky Action at a Distance."

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:17.180 align:middle line:84%
But for us to have such a
relationship, if it does exist,

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:20.300 align:middle line:84%
there must be something that
our thoughts and feelings

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:22.970 align:middle line:84%
and emotions and
beliefs move through

00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:24.560 align:middle line:90%
to connect us to another.

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:26.000 align:middle line:90%
Well, there is.

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:30.200 align:middle line:84%
And that's what this episode
is all about-- the idea

00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:34.280 align:middle line:84%
that everything is connected
by some kind of energy,

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:35.780 align:middle line:90%
by a field of energy.

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:40.190 align:middle line:84%
It was actually a very popular
idea in the late 1800s.

00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:43.940 align:middle line:84%
In the late 1800s, there was
this tremendous spiritual

00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:48.320 align:middle line:84%
revolution that was sweeping
the scientific world.

00:02:48.320 --> 00:02:51.260 align:middle line:10%
And the scientists
were forcing themselves

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:54.380 align:middle line:10%
to come to terms--
they had to know,

00:02:54.380 --> 00:02:57.140 align:middle line:10%
is there a field that
connects all things

00:02:57.140 --> 00:03:00.950 align:middle line:10%
and makes these connections
meaningful in our lives?

00:03:00.950 --> 00:03:03.230 align:middle line:84%
Or are we, in fact, separate
from everything else?

00:03:03.230 --> 00:03:05.600 align:middle line:84%
They said we need to
know once and for all.

00:03:05.600 --> 00:03:10.010 align:middle line:84%
In the late 1800s, the name
that scientists gave the field

00:03:10.010 --> 00:03:12.350 align:middle line:84%
that they suspected
actually existed

00:03:12.350 --> 00:03:15.270 align:middle line:90%
was called the ether field.

00:03:15.270 --> 00:03:18.200 align:middle line:84%
But if you're watching this
today and you're a scientist,

00:03:18.200 --> 00:03:19.880 align:middle line:84%
I just want to give
you a heads up,

00:03:19.880 --> 00:03:22.820 align:middle line:84%
this is a term that you do not
want to use at any conference

00:03:22.820 --> 00:03:25.460 align:middle line:84%
that you go to if you still
want the audience to be

00:03:25.460 --> 00:03:28.940 align:middle line:84%
in the room for the conference
because the term the ether

00:03:28.940 --> 00:03:33.320 align:middle line:84%
field was deemed invalid in
the scientific community.

00:03:33.320 --> 00:03:37.320 align:middle line:84%
And any reference to it
today is not taken credibly.

00:03:37.320 --> 00:03:40.010 align:middle line:84%
I want to talk to you
about how scientists

00:03:40.010 --> 00:03:43.670 align:middle line:84%
came to that conclusion and
what they believe this ether

00:03:43.670 --> 00:03:45.950 align:middle line:90%
field is really all about.

00:03:45.950 --> 00:03:48.150 align:middle line:90%
Let's go back to 1887.

00:03:48.150 --> 00:03:51.720 align:middle line:84%
In 1887, two very
famous scientists

00:03:51.720 --> 00:03:55.800 align:middle line:84%
Michelson and Morley
designed an experiment

00:03:55.800 --> 00:03:59.070 align:middle line:84%
to finally settle the argument,
to tell us once and for all,

00:03:59.070 --> 00:04:01.500 align:middle line:84%
is there a field that
connects all things

00:04:01.500 --> 00:04:03.697 align:middle line:84%
or is everything
really separate?

00:04:03.697 --> 00:04:05.280 align:middle line:84%
Let me tell you a
little bit about how

00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:06.720 align:middle line:90%
the experiment worked.

00:04:06.720 --> 00:04:09.750 align:middle line:84%
And then I'd like for you to see
the actual experiment itself.

00:04:09.750 --> 00:04:14.010 align:middle line:84%
If I invited you from wherever
you are right now in a building

00:04:14.010 --> 00:04:18.209 align:middle line:84%
to go outside of that building
and to moisten your index

00:04:18.209 --> 00:04:23.250 align:middle line:84%
finger and place it above
your head, and in the moment

00:04:23.250 --> 00:04:31.000 align:middle line:84%
that you did so if you felt
no wind against your finger

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:36.390 align:middle line:84%
and from that you concluded
that no air exists,

00:04:36.390 --> 00:04:39.090 align:middle line:84%
that would be the equivalent
of this experiment.

00:04:39.090 --> 00:04:42.037 align:middle line:84%
Is it true, if you feel no wind,
does that mean there's no air?

00:04:42.037 --> 00:04:42.870 align:middle line:90%
Well, of course not.

00:04:42.870 --> 00:04:43.770 align:middle line:90%
The air can be there.

00:04:43.770 --> 00:04:45.540 align:middle line:90%
It's just not moving.

00:04:45.540 --> 00:04:47.910 align:middle line:84%
Michelson and Morley
and other scientists

00:04:47.910 --> 00:04:52.350 align:middle line:84%
as well, they believed that this
field that connects all things,

00:04:52.350 --> 00:04:57.510 align:middle line:84%
that this ether field was a
living, vibrating, pulsating

00:04:57.510 --> 00:05:01.440 align:middle line:84%
field of energy and that
it should be in motion.

00:05:01.440 --> 00:05:05.040 align:middle line:84%
And if they could detect that
motion, that it would determine

00:05:05.040 --> 00:05:07.530 align:middle line:84%
and answer the question as
to whether or not the field

00:05:07.530 --> 00:05:10.320 align:middle line:90%
exists, truly, once and for all.

00:05:10.320 --> 00:05:12.480 align:middle line:90%
So they designed an experiment.

00:05:12.480 --> 00:05:15.322 align:middle line:84%
And I'm going to call your
attention to the image

00:05:15.322 --> 00:05:16.530 align:middle line:90%
that you're seeing right now.

00:05:16.530 --> 00:05:20.970 align:middle line:84%
This is a very rare image
of the actual device.

00:05:20.970 --> 00:05:24.360 align:middle line:10%
It was called an interferometer,
the Michelson-Morley

00:05:24.360 --> 00:05:25.950 align:middle line:10%
interferometer.

00:05:25.950 --> 00:05:27.640 align:middle line:84%
This is what the
device looked like.

00:05:27.640 --> 00:05:30.450 align:middle line:84%
And I'm going to give
you a schematic of what

00:05:30.450 --> 00:05:32.790 align:middle line:90%
it was actually doing.

00:05:32.790 --> 00:05:36.930 align:middle line:10%
What the experiment was doing
was shooting a beam of light

00:05:36.930 --> 00:05:41.220 align:middle line:10%
against one mirror that
would split that beam to two

00:05:41.220 --> 00:05:43.860 align:middle line:10%
different mirrors in
two different places,

00:05:43.860 --> 00:05:48.150 align:middle line:10%
reflect them back to
a collecting mirror.

00:05:48.150 --> 00:05:51.840 align:middle line:10%
And the idea was this--
if the field's in motion,

00:05:51.840 --> 00:05:54.300 align:middle line:10%
those two beams
of light would not

00:05:54.300 --> 00:05:57.180 align:middle line:10%
come back to the same
place at the same time.

00:05:57.180 --> 00:06:00.115 align:middle line:10%
There would be what is called
an interference pattern.

00:06:00.115 --> 00:06:02.490 align:middle line:10%
And that's what they were
looking for was an interference

00:06:02.490 --> 00:06:05.190 align:middle line:10%
pattern in the light beams.

00:06:05.190 --> 00:06:09.960 align:middle line:10%
Well, they conducted this
experiment in 1887, 1888.

00:06:09.960 --> 00:06:12.960 align:middle line:84%
And what they determined
from that experiment--

00:06:12.960 --> 00:06:16.350 align:middle line:84%
in my opinion, I think
it was a good experiment,

00:06:16.350 --> 00:06:18.370 align:middle line:84%
but I think it was
poorly interpreted.

00:06:18.370 --> 00:06:21.630 align:middle line:84%
But they had no way of knowing
in their time what we now

00:06:21.630 --> 00:06:22.920 align:middle line:90%
know today.

00:06:22.920 --> 00:06:26.130 align:middle line:84%
And they didn't have the quality
of equipment in their time

00:06:26.130 --> 00:06:27.720 align:middle line:90%
that we have today.

00:06:27.720 --> 00:06:30.630 align:middle line:84%
So in my opinion, it
was poorly interpreted

00:06:30.630 --> 00:06:33.810 align:middle line:84%
because they believed that
there was no interference

00:06:33.810 --> 00:06:35.180 align:middle line:90%
pattern that they witnessed.

00:06:35.180 --> 00:06:38.490 align:middle line:84%
And from that, Michelson
and Morley concluded,

00:06:38.490 --> 00:06:41.220 align:middle line:84%
and they published in
scientific journals,

00:06:41.220 --> 00:06:45.180 align:middle line:84%
peer-reviewed scientific
journals, in the late 1800s,

00:06:45.180 --> 00:06:46.876 align:middle line:90%
that there is no field.

00:06:46.876 --> 00:06:50.380 align:middle line:84%
And you say, OK, I
understand the experiment.

00:06:50.380 --> 00:06:51.180 align:middle line:90%
What does it mean?

00:06:51.180 --> 00:06:52.950 align:middle line:90%
Why is it important?

00:06:52.950 --> 00:06:58.350 align:middle line:84%
From 1887 until
only recently, this

00:06:58.350 --> 00:07:02.820 align:middle line:84%
means that all science, the best
science of the modern world,

00:07:02.820 --> 00:07:07.016 align:middle line:84%
as good as it's been, has been
based in a false assumption

00:07:07.016 --> 00:07:08.640 align:middle line:84%
that there is no
field, that everything

00:07:08.640 --> 00:07:10.580 align:middle line:84%
is separate from
everything else,

00:07:10.580 --> 00:07:13.770 align:middle line:84%
that there is no field of
energy that connects what's

00:07:13.770 --> 00:07:16.590 align:middle line:84%
happening in one place to
what's happening somewhere else.

00:07:16.590 --> 00:07:18.330 align:middle line:90%
This is the science.

00:07:18.330 --> 00:07:20.310 align:middle line:84%
Our ancestors,
indigenous people,

00:07:20.310 --> 00:07:22.740 align:middle line:84%
always began with a belief
that everything was connected.

00:07:22.740 --> 00:07:24.690 align:middle line:84%
Now, I find this
really interesting,

00:07:24.690 --> 00:07:28.710 align:middle line:84%
fascinating because
for 5,000 years,

00:07:28.710 --> 00:07:32.760 align:middle line:84%
ancient, indigenous,
spiritual traditions,

00:07:32.760 --> 00:07:38.140 align:middle line:84%
they began with the assumption
that everything is connected.

00:07:38.140 --> 00:07:41.250 align:middle line:84%
And they devoted their
time, that 5,000 years,

00:07:41.250 --> 00:07:43.730 align:middle line:84%
to learning and understanding
what that connection means

00:07:43.730 --> 00:07:44.530 align:middle line:90%
in our lives.

00:07:44.530 --> 00:07:46.350 align:middle line:84%
How do we apply it in
our lives to become

00:07:46.350 --> 00:07:49.830 align:middle line:84%
better people, create better
families, stronger communities?

00:07:49.830 --> 00:07:55.230 align:middle line:84%
Science for 300 years has
struggled as to whether or not

00:07:55.230 --> 00:07:57.210 align:middle line:90%
this field actually exists.

00:07:57.210 --> 00:08:00.930 align:middle line:84%
And for 300 years, they've been
arguing as to whether or not

00:08:00.930 --> 00:08:02.040 align:middle line:90%
it exists.

00:08:02.040 --> 00:08:06.150 align:middle line:84%
1887, from that point
forward, all of our science

00:08:06.150 --> 00:08:09.480 align:middle line:84%
has been based in the
belief of separation--

00:08:09.480 --> 00:08:12.510 align:middle line:90%
that is, until recently.

00:08:12.510 --> 00:08:17.820 align:middle line:10%
100 years later, in 1987,
there was an experiment

00:08:17.820 --> 00:08:20.370 align:middle line:10%
that was conducted under the
auspices of the United States

00:08:20.370 --> 00:08:21.262 align:middle line:10%
Air Force.

00:08:21.262 --> 00:08:24.240 align:middle line:84%
And they had better equipment,
much better equipment.

00:08:24.240 --> 00:08:26.670 align:middle line:84%
But they used precisely
the same principle

00:08:26.670 --> 00:08:29.890 align:middle line:84%
that Michelson and Morley
had used 100 years earlier.

00:08:29.890 --> 00:08:32.820 align:middle line:84%
And guess what they
found 100 years later?

00:08:32.820 --> 00:08:35.669 align:middle line:84%
The Air Force sanctioned
the experiment,

00:08:35.669 --> 00:08:39.690 align:middle line:84%
found that there is, in
fact, a field of energy

00:08:39.690 --> 00:08:41.400 align:middle line:90%
that connects all things.

00:08:41.400 --> 00:08:43.600 align:middle line:84%
And not only does
the field exist,

00:08:43.600 --> 00:08:46.290 align:middle line:84%
it exists precisely
within the parameters

00:08:46.290 --> 00:08:49.410 align:middle line:84%
that Michelson and Morley
expected it to exist.

00:08:49.410 --> 00:08:51.600 align:middle line:84%
They just didn't have the
equipment to prove it.

00:08:51.600 --> 00:08:54.810 align:middle line:84%
So we now know that this
field actually exists.

00:08:54.810 --> 00:08:56.580 align:middle line:84%
The results of the
Air Force experiment

00:08:56.580 --> 00:08:59.040 align:middle line:84%
were published in the
very prestigious journal

00:08:59.040 --> 00:09:04.470 align:middle line:84%
"Nature" in August of 1986,
almost 100 years later.

00:09:04.470 --> 00:09:07.560 align:middle line:84%
And the scientific
community discovered

00:09:07.560 --> 00:09:10.800 align:middle line:84%
that they had been
assuming falsely

00:09:10.800 --> 00:09:13.620 align:middle line:90%
the separation of all things.

00:09:13.620 --> 00:09:15.660 align:middle line:84%
So now we know,
there is a field.

00:09:15.660 --> 00:09:18.720 align:middle line:84%
And it is accurate to talk about
the field and the fact that it

00:09:18.720 --> 00:09:19.830 align:middle line:90%
exists.

00:09:19.830 --> 00:09:23.790 align:middle line:84%
So there is no longer a question
in the scientific community

00:09:23.790 --> 00:09:26.580 align:middle line:84%
as to whether or not
this field exists.

00:09:26.580 --> 00:09:29.640 align:middle line:84%
The question is, what
does it mean in our lives?

00:09:29.640 --> 00:09:31.570 align:middle line:84%
They've given this
field a new name.

00:09:31.570 --> 00:09:33.510 align:middle line:84%
And as I mentioned
before, we can no longer

00:09:33.510 --> 00:09:35.520 align:middle line:90%
call it the ether field.

00:09:35.520 --> 00:09:37.440 align:middle line:84%
So now this field
has many names.

00:09:37.440 --> 00:09:40.980 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes it is simply
called The Field.

00:09:40.980 --> 00:09:43.350 align:middle line:10%
Lynne McTaggart did
a book not long ago

00:09:43.350 --> 00:09:45.344 align:middle line:10%
that was simply called
"The Field," where

00:09:45.344 --> 00:09:47.385 align:middle line:10%
she explored the implications
and the possibility

00:09:47.385 --> 00:09:48.684 align:middle line:10%
of The Field.

00:09:48.684 --> 00:09:50.350 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes it's called
the Quantum Field.

00:09:50.350 --> 00:09:53.130 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes people like to
call this God or The Source

00:09:53.130 --> 00:09:55.500 align:middle line:84%
or The Matrix or
the Divine Matrix.

00:09:55.500 --> 00:09:59.340 align:middle line:84%
All of these terms-- maybe
you have one of your own--

00:09:59.340 --> 00:10:02.370 align:middle line:84%
are based in this idea
that the field exists.

00:10:02.370 --> 00:10:07.260 align:middle line:84%
The movie "The Matrix" was
actually based in the science

00:10:07.260 --> 00:10:11.340 align:middle line:84%
that said there is another world
that exists in this field that

00:10:11.340 --> 00:10:15.270 align:middle line:84%
we simply cannot see from our
perspective from where we are

00:10:15.270 --> 00:10:16.595 align:middle line:90%
right now.

00:10:16.595 --> 00:10:17.970 align:middle line:84%
But just because
we can't see it,

00:10:17.970 --> 00:10:19.620 align:middle line:90%
doesn't mean it doesn't exist.

00:10:19.620 --> 00:10:23.340 align:middle line:84%
And that what happens in
this field that we cannot see

00:10:23.340 --> 00:10:26.490 align:middle line:84%
actually influences, and
in many cases drives,

00:10:26.490 --> 00:10:29.650 align:middle line:84%
the events that we see
in our everyday lives.

00:10:29.650 --> 00:10:31.370 align:middle line:84%
So you can see why
this is a quandary.

00:10:31.370 --> 00:10:32.970 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to reference
back-- remember

00:10:32.970 --> 00:10:36.270 align:middle line:84%
the inverted pyramid, the
false assumptions of science?

00:10:36.270 --> 00:10:39.360 align:middle line:84%
One of those assumptions is
that everything is separate.

00:10:39.360 --> 00:10:41.790 align:middle line:84%
And much of our science
has been based on that.

00:10:41.790 --> 00:10:45.250 align:middle line:84%
Now we know, it
simply is not true.

00:10:45.250 --> 00:10:47.880 align:middle line:84%
So we now know that
this field exists.

00:10:47.880 --> 00:10:50.190 align:middle line:84%
We now know that we're
connected to the field.

00:10:50.190 --> 00:10:53.579 align:middle line:84%
The question is, what
does the field do?

00:10:53.579 --> 00:10:55.620 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to invite you
to think about this field

00:10:55.620 --> 00:11:00.330 align:middle line:84%
as fulfilling three
fundamental capacities.

00:11:00.330 --> 00:11:03.990 align:middle line:84%
Number one, it is the
container for all things.

00:11:03.990 --> 00:11:06.450 align:middle line:84%
From the perspective
of the way science

00:11:06.450 --> 00:11:10.320 align:middle line:84%
is now viewing this field,
everything that we know

00:11:10.320 --> 00:11:11.430 align:middle line:90%
exists within the field.

00:11:11.430 --> 00:11:13.920 align:middle line:84%
The universe exists
within this field.

00:11:13.920 --> 00:11:15.540 align:middle line:84%
Nothing exists
beyond this field.

00:11:15.540 --> 00:11:18.180 align:middle line:84%
So all things that are
happening are happening

00:11:18.180 --> 00:11:20.340 align:middle line:90%
within this field, number one.

00:11:20.340 --> 00:11:26.840 align:middle line:84%
Number two, the field
is a bridge between us

00:11:26.840 --> 00:11:31.250 align:middle line:84%
and the world around us, between
our inner and outer worlds.

00:11:31.250 --> 00:11:37.010 align:middle line:84%
That's important because when
we offer, for example, healing

00:11:37.010 --> 00:11:41.360 align:middle line:84%
energy to another person maybe
halfway around the world, when

00:11:41.360 --> 00:11:45.110 align:middle line:84%
we offer a prayer, as our
indigenous ancestors have

00:11:45.110 --> 00:11:48.140 align:middle line:84%
suggested and taught the
traditions and the techniques

00:11:48.140 --> 00:11:50.820 align:middle line:84%
of how we do it,
and we say, how does

00:11:50.820 --> 00:11:53.760 align:middle line:84%
that prayer in my living
room influence somebody half

00:11:53.760 --> 00:11:55.037 align:middle line:90%
a world away?

00:11:55.037 --> 00:11:56.370 align:middle line:90%
The field is the answer to that.

00:11:56.370 --> 00:12:00.550 align:middle line:84%
It is the bridge between
our inner and outer worlds.

00:12:00.550 --> 00:12:05.040 align:middle line:84%
And thirdly, the third function
that this field serves,

00:12:05.040 --> 00:12:06.840 align:middle line:90%
it is a mirror.

00:12:06.840 --> 00:12:13.230 align:middle line:84%
The energy of this field is a
mirror in the world around us

00:12:13.230 --> 00:12:18.300 align:middle line:84%
for what we claim to be
true in the world within us.

00:12:18.300 --> 00:12:20.280 align:middle line:90%
Let me clarify this.

00:12:20.280 --> 00:12:23.700 align:middle line:84%
We all have beliefs and
expectations about what's true

00:12:23.700 --> 00:12:25.574 align:middle line:84%
and what's possible
in the world.

00:12:25.574 --> 00:12:26.740 align:middle line:90%
Sometimes they're conscious.

00:12:26.740 --> 00:12:28.416 align:middle line:90%
Sometimes they're not.

00:12:28.416 --> 00:12:30.780 align:middle line:84%
But whether they're
conscious or not,

00:12:30.780 --> 00:12:34.440 align:middle line:84%
the world is always telling
us what our true beliefs are.

00:12:34.440 --> 00:12:36.060 align:middle line:84%
The quality of
our relationships,

00:12:36.060 --> 00:12:37.890 align:middle line:84%
the kind of job
we have, the kind

00:12:37.890 --> 00:12:42.300 align:middle line:84%
of people that we draw into
our lives, all our abundance,

00:12:42.300 --> 00:12:44.970 align:middle line:84%
our healing, our
health, all of these

00:12:44.970 --> 00:12:51.750 align:middle line:84%
are examples of the
field mirroring to us

00:12:51.750 --> 00:12:55.080 align:middle line:84%
what it is that we claim
to be true in our deepest,

00:12:55.080 --> 00:12:57.780 align:middle line:90%
sometimes subconscious, beliefs.

00:12:57.780 --> 00:13:00.420 align:middle line:84%
All right, so we've just covered
a lot of ground right there.

00:13:00.420 --> 00:13:02.760 align:middle line:84%
Let me just kind
of summarize that.

00:13:02.760 --> 00:13:05.070 align:middle line:90%
The field is three things.

00:13:05.070 --> 00:13:07.020 align:middle line:84%
It is the container
for all things.

00:13:07.020 --> 00:13:09.960 align:middle line:84%
It's the bridge between our
inner and our outer worlds.

00:13:09.960 --> 00:13:13.260 align:middle line:84%
And it is the mirror
in the world around us

00:13:13.260 --> 00:13:17.700 align:middle line:84%
for what we believe to be true
consciously and subconsciously

00:13:17.700 --> 00:13:18.990 align:middle line:90%
from within.

00:13:18.990 --> 00:13:22.950 align:middle line:84%
So with that, let's take
this one step further.

00:13:22.950 --> 00:13:27.567 align:middle line:84%
There now is no longer
any controversy as to

00:13:27.567 --> 00:13:29.650 align:middle line:84%
whether or not the field
exists and whether or not

00:13:29.650 --> 00:13:30.530 align:middle line:90%
we're connected.

00:13:30.530 --> 00:13:34.330 align:middle line:84%
The question is, how
deeply are we connected?

00:13:34.330 --> 00:13:37.590 align:middle line:84%
What does this field
really mean for us?

00:13:37.590 --> 00:13:41.660 align:middle line:84%
And this is where one of the
most innovative experiments

00:13:41.660 --> 00:13:47.390 align:middle line:84%
in recent years did, in fact,
make mainstream science,

00:13:47.390 --> 00:13:51.320 align:middle line:84%
mainstream journals-- and it
happened relatively recently

00:13:51.320 --> 00:13:53.160 align:middle line:84%
in an experiment
that was performed

00:13:53.160 --> 00:13:56.130 align:middle line:84%
for the University of
Geneva in Switzerland.

00:13:56.130 --> 00:14:00.350 align:middle line:84%
A scientist named Nicholas
Gisin did this experiment.

00:14:00.350 --> 00:14:04.430 align:middle line:84%
He reported it to over 3,400
journalists, educators,

00:14:04.430 --> 00:14:07.580 align:middle line:84%
scientists, engineers, and more
than 40 countries on a Friday

00:14:07.580 --> 00:14:12.350 align:middle line:90%
afternoon, July 25, 1997.

00:14:12.350 --> 00:14:16.790 align:middle line:84%
The experiment is called
the twin-photon experiment.

00:14:16.790 --> 00:14:19.070 align:middle line:90%
And it goes like this.

00:14:19.070 --> 00:14:22.790 align:middle line:84%
Photons are what
atoms are made of.

00:14:22.790 --> 00:14:27.410 align:middle line:84%
Photons are light particles
that the stuff of this world

00:14:27.410 --> 00:14:28.580 align:middle line:90%
is made of.

00:14:28.580 --> 00:14:31.010 align:middle line:84%
So it made tremendous
sense that the researchers

00:14:31.010 --> 00:14:33.350 align:middle line:84%
would want to do
their experiment

00:14:33.350 --> 00:14:36.830 align:middle line:84%
on the stuff our world is made
of to see how that stuff is

00:14:36.830 --> 00:14:38.015 align:middle line:90%
influenced by the field.

00:14:38.015 --> 00:14:40.020 align:middle line:90%
So here's what they did.

00:14:40.020 --> 00:14:42.110 align:middle line:90%
They took a single photon.

00:14:42.110 --> 00:14:44.900 align:middle line:84%
Some really
sophisticated technology

00:14:44.900 --> 00:14:48.410 align:middle line:84%
allowed them to isolate
a single photon.

00:14:48.410 --> 00:14:53.000 align:middle line:84%
And they wanted to have
two identical photons,

00:14:53.000 --> 00:14:57.290 align:middle line:84%
identical properties, so they
took the one single photon

00:14:57.290 --> 00:15:01.390 align:middle line:84%
and they split it in
two so that each would

00:15:01.390 --> 00:15:02.515 align:middle line:90%
have identical properties.

00:15:02.515 --> 00:15:03.820 align:middle line:90%
It used to be one photon.

00:15:03.820 --> 00:15:05.700 align:middle line:90%
Now we have two.

00:15:05.700 --> 00:15:09.840 align:middle line:84%
They placed these two
photons into a device,

00:15:09.840 --> 00:15:13.910 align:middle line:84%
a specialized
device that allowed

00:15:13.910 --> 00:15:18.332 align:middle line:84%
them to shoot the photons,
particles of light--

00:15:18.332 --> 00:15:19.790 align:middle line:84%
if you can think
of it in your mind

00:15:19.790 --> 00:15:23.210 align:middle line:84%
this way-- to shoot
the particles of light

00:15:23.210 --> 00:15:27.560 align:middle line:84%
through fiber optic cables
in opposite directions

00:15:27.560 --> 00:15:29.240 align:middle line:90%
from where they began.

00:15:29.240 --> 00:15:31.490 align:middle line:84%
So if you can think,
here's the gadget.

00:15:31.490 --> 00:15:33.500 align:middle line:90%
Here's a little box.

00:15:33.500 --> 00:15:36.860 align:middle line:84%
Two photons-- one photon
is going in this direction.

00:15:36.860 --> 00:15:39.500 align:middle line:84%
One photon is going
in this direction.

00:15:39.500 --> 00:15:43.850 align:middle line:84%
Each of the fiber optic
cables was seven miles long.

00:15:43.850 --> 00:15:47.870 align:middle line:84%
So when the twin photons
reached their target,

00:15:47.870 --> 00:15:52.350 align:middle line:84%
their destination, on either
edge of this experiment,

00:15:52.350 --> 00:15:55.460 align:middle line:84%
they were a total
of 14 miles apart.

00:15:55.460 --> 00:15:58.190 align:middle line:84%
And this is where the
real experiment began.

00:15:58.190 --> 00:16:01.130 align:middle line:84%
Because what the
scientists began to do

00:16:01.130 --> 00:16:06.530 align:middle line:84%
was they began to influence--
the word they used was tickle.

00:16:06.530 --> 00:16:11.480 align:middle line:84%
They began to tickle
one photon in one place.

00:16:11.480 --> 00:16:16.430 align:middle line:84%
And they were able to observe
the other photon 14 miles away

00:16:16.430 --> 00:16:19.310 align:middle line:84%
to see what might be
happening in that place.

00:16:19.310 --> 00:16:23.120 align:middle line:84%
And what they found made
no sense to the science

00:16:23.120 --> 00:16:27.320 align:middle line:84%
as it had been embraced where
the field does not exist.

00:16:27.320 --> 00:16:30.770 align:middle line:84%
What they found is that when
they disturbed or tickled

00:16:30.770 --> 00:16:34.275 align:middle line:84%
one of the twin photons in
one place, the other one

00:16:34.275 --> 00:16:39.800 align:middle line:84%
14 miles away, it acted like it
had the exact same experience,

00:16:39.800 --> 00:16:42.350 align:middle line:84%
even though it was
not directly being

00:16:42.350 --> 00:16:44.810 align:middle line:90%
touched by the scientists.

00:16:44.810 --> 00:16:46.370 align:middle line:90%
So how can that be?

00:16:46.370 --> 00:16:48.230 align:middle line:84%
When they would force
one of the photons

00:16:48.230 --> 00:16:51.140 align:middle line:84%
to rotate in a
particular direction,

00:16:51.140 --> 00:16:53.240 align:middle line:84%
the other one 14
miles away rotated

00:16:53.240 --> 00:16:55.130 align:middle line:90%
in exactly the same direction.

00:16:55.130 --> 00:16:58.850 align:middle line:84%
When they would electrically
charge or remove

00:16:58.850 --> 00:17:00.879 align:middle line:84%
a charge from a
photon in one place,

00:17:00.879 --> 00:17:02.920 align:middle line:84%
the same thing would happen
without them doing it

00:17:02.920 --> 00:17:04.579 align:middle line:90%
in the other place.

00:17:04.579 --> 00:17:06.014 align:middle line:90%
They said, what does this mean?

00:17:06.014 --> 00:17:07.430 align:middle line:84%
What is this telling
us right now?

00:17:07.430 --> 00:17:10.220 align:middle line:84%
This is what was reported
to the journalists.

00:17:10.220 --> 00:17:13.280 align:middle line:84%
And it was reported in the
mainstream publications.

00:17:13.280 --> 00:17:15.380 align:middle line:90%
The experiment was reported.

00:17:15.380 --> 00:17:20.420 align:middle line:84%
The implications are where
the controversy begins.

00:17:20.420 --> 00:17:21.611 align:middle line:90%
Why?

00:17:21.611 --> 00:17:27.079 align:middle line:84%
Why was one photon 14 miles away
being influenced by another one

00:17:27.079 --> 00:17:29.720 align:middle line:84%
when they were not
physically connected?

00:17:29.720 --> 00:17:33.110 align:middle line:84%
So this is where the idea
of this field comes in.

00:17:33.110 --> 00:17:35.660 align:middle line:84%
The fact of the
connection, the term that

00:17:35.660 --> 00:17:37.340 align:middle line:84%
is now given-- a
new term had to be

00:17:37.340 --> 00:17:41.120 align:middle line:84%
coined-- the term is
called entanglement.

00:17:41.120 --> 00:17:42.530 align:middle line:90%
Entanglement.

00:17:42.530 --> 00:17:47.139 align:middle line:84%
And what entanglement means
is summarized in the journal,

00:17:47.139 --> 00:17:49.430 align:middle line:84%
the scientific journal that
reported on the experiment.

00:17:49.430 --> 00:17:51.570 align:middle line:84%
So I'm going to read
it to you word for word

00:17:51.570 --> 00:17:53.900 align:middle line:84%
just so we have
the exact language.

00:17:53.900 --> 00:18:00.450 align:middle line:84%
It suggests that once matter is
joined physically-- once matter

00:18:00.450 --> 00:18:03.240 align:middle line:84%
is joined physically--
because those two photons used

00:18:03.240 --> 00:18:10.110 align:middle line:84%
to be one photon-- it remains
linked energetically, even

00:18:10.110 --> 00:18:11.880 align:middle line:90%
after the photons are split.

00:18:11.880 --> 00:18:15.000 align:middle line:84%
Even when they are no
longer physically touching,

00:18:15.000 --> 00:18:17.430 align:middle line:84%
they remain
energetically linked,

00:18:17.430 --> 00:18:19.480 align:middle line:90%
regardless of their location.

00:18:19.480 --> 00:18:21.740 align:middle line:90%
Here's why this is important.

00:18:21.740 --> 00:18:24.700 align:middle line:84%
It implies that once
matter is connected,

00:18:24.700 --> 00:18:26.380 align:middle line:90%
all matter is connected.

00:18:26.380 --> 00:18:28.060 align:middle line:90%
Now, what do I mean by that?

00:18:28.060 --> 00:18:29.950 align:middle line:90%
What am I saying here?

00:18:29.950 --> 00:18:33.610 align:middle line:84%
This experiment on a
small level is telling us

00:18:33.610 --> 00:18:36.040 align:middle line:84%
something very, very
powerful about us

00:18:36.040 --> 00:18:38.950 align:middle line:84%
and our universe on
a much larger level.

00:18:38.950 --> 00:18:43.870 align:middle line:84%
It implies that once
physical matter is connected,

00:18:43.870 --> 00:18:49.370 align:middle line:84%
even when it is separated, even
when something tears it apart

00:18:49.370 --> 00:18:52.510 align:middle line:84%
and that matter ends up
on other sides of a room,

00:18:52.510 --> 00:18:56.260 align:middle line:84%
other sides of a continent,
other sides of a universe,

00:18:56.260 --> 00:18:58.510 align:middle line:84%
physically, it's
still connected.

00:18:58.510 --> 00:19:01.045 align:middle line:84%
This is important because
scientists tell us

00:19:01.045 --> 00:19:06.220 align:middle line:84%
that if we could go back in
time a long, long time ago, far,

00:19:06.220 --> 00:19:11.110 align:middle line:84%
far away, to the very beginning
of what scientists believe

00:19:11.110 --> 00:19:14.290 align:middle line:84%
is the Big Bang, the
time when there was

00:19:14.290 --> 00:19:20.290 align:middle line:84%
a primal release of energy and
the universe began to expand

00:19:20.290 --> 00:19:22.930 align:middle line:84%
in the way it continues to
do today-- they tell us,

00:19:22.930 --> 00:19:24.610 align:middle line:84%
if we could go
back to the instant

00:19:24.610 --> 00:19:28.030 align:middle line:84%
just before that happened,
here's what we would see.

00:19:28.030 --> 00:19:31.420 align:middle line:84%
They say that if you
take all the space out

00:19:31.420 --> 00:19:35.710 align:middle line:84%
from in between the atoms, all
the atoms in the universe--

00:19:35.710 --> 00:19:39.220 align:middle line:84%
they say if you take all the
atoms in the universe today

00:19:39.220 --> 00:19:42.100 align:middle line:84%
and you take out the empty
space and you compress

00:19:42.100 --> 00:19:44.650 align:middle line:84%
all of the physical
matter, it would

00:19:44.650 --> 00:19:49.330 align:middle line:84%
be compressed into a
solid ball of matter

00:19:49.330 --> 00:19:54.490 align:middle line:84%
about the size of
a single green pea.

00:19:54.490 --> 00:19:57.880 align:middle line:84%
And they say that is
what happened just

00:19:57.880 --> 00:20:00.700 align:middle line:84%
after the instant
of the Big Bang.

00:20:00.700 --> 00:20:04.100 align:middle line:84%
At the instant of the
Big Bang, all the matter

00:20:04.100 --> 00:20:08.890 align:middle line:84%
was compressed into
a single green pea.

00:20:08.890 --> 00:20:11.260 align:middle line:84%
And it was at a very,
very high temperature.

00:20:11.260 --> 00:20:14.140 align:middle line:84%
And what the scientists have
told me was, at that time,

00:20:14.140 --> 00:20:16.660 align:middle line:84%
that the temperature
was about 18 billion,

00:20:16.660 --> 00:20:19.054 align:middle line:84%
million, million, million
degrees Fahrenheit.

00:20:19.054 --> 00:20:21.220 align:middle line:84%
And I said, come on, you
guys, how do you know that?

00:20:21.220 --> 00:20:23.500 align:middle line:84%
And they said, well, we
just know it was really hot.

00:20:23.500 --> 00:20:27.070 align:middle line:84%
So we can say that it was really
hot when all of the matter

00:20:27.070 --> 00:20:31.540 align:middle line:84%
was compressed into a space
the size of a single green pea.

00:20:31.540 --> 00:20:33.580 align:middle line:84%
And then something
began to happen.

00:20:33.580 --> 00:20:36.330 align:middle line:84%
We don't know
exactly why or how.

00:20:36.330 --> 00:20:42.310 align:middle line:84%
But what scientists say to us
is that that green pea began

00:20:42.310 --> 00:20:44.950 align:middle line:90%
to expand very, very quickly.

00:20:44.950 --> 00:20:49.660 align:middle line:84%
And that as is expanded, what
was once physically connected

00:20:49.660 --> 00:20:53.830 align:middle line:84%
in that small space became
the physical matter that

00:20:53.830 --> 00:20:56.170 align:middle line:84%
continues to expand
in the universe today.

00:20:56.170 --> 00:20:59.230 align:middle line:84%
And this is the reason
scientists believe that the Big

00:20:59.230 --> 00:21:00.850 align:middle line:90%
Bang actually occurred.

00:21:00.850 --> 00:21:03.940 align:middle line:84%
Because although the
universe is expanding now,

00:21:03.940 --> 00:21:07.870 align:middle line:84%
if they reverse the
trajectory, if they reverse

00:21:07.870 --> 00:21:10.570 align:middle line:84%
the mathematics,
they can follow all

00:21:10.570 --> 00:21:13.870 align:middle line:84%
of that moving matter
backwards in time to the point

00:21:13.870 --> 00:21:18.100 align:middle line:84%
where it was at a place that
is called the singularity.

00:21:18.100 --> 00:21:20.320 align:middle line:84%
The singularity, the
Big Bang singularity,

00:21:20.320 --> 00:21:25.212 align:middle line:84%
is the place where everything
was once physically connected.

00:21:25.212 --> 00:21:26.920 align:middle line:84%
So I'm sharing this
with you now and I've

00:21:26.920 --> 00:21:30.100 align:middle line:84%
gone into a little bit of
detail for this reason.

00:21:30.100 --> 00:21:32.845 align:middle line:84%
The summary of the
experiments-- once matter

00:21:32.845 --> 00:21:34.810 align:middle line:84%
is connected
physically, it remains

00:21:34.810 --> 00:21:37.090 align:middle line:90%
connected energetically.

00:21:37.090 --> 00:21:40.630 align:middle line:84%
At the instant of the Big
Bang, all matter was connected.

00:21:40.630 --> 00:21:43.480 align:middle line:84%
All the matter in your body,
all the matter in my body,

00:21:43.480 --> 00:21:46.270 align:middle line:84%
all the matter in this
planet and every star-- it

00:21:46.270 --> 00:21:49.180 align:middle line:84%
all came from that
little green pea.

00:21:49.180 --> 00:21:55.060 align:middle line:84%
So if it was once connected and
is now expanding and separate

00:21:55.060 --> 00:21:58.840 align:middle line:84%
as it is, are we still
connected energetically?

00:21:58.840 --> 00:22:02.740 align:middle line:84%
That's why the twin-photon
experiment is so powerful.

00:22:02.740 --> 00:22:06.100 align:middle line:84%
Because that experiment
suggests the answer is yes.

00:22:06.100 --> 00:22:09.700 align:middle line:84%
The evidence suggests that
we are deeply connected.

00:22:09.700 --> 00:22:12.430 align:middle line:84%
So the question now is less
about does the connection

00:22:12.430 --> 00:22:16.070 align:middle line:84%
exist, it's more about
what does it mean?

00:22:16.070 --> 00:22:18.590 align:middle line:84%
How deep does that
connection really go?

00:22:18.590 --> 00:22:21.790 align:middle line:84%
Does it go beyond
the level of photons

00:22:21.790 --> 00:22:24.310 align:middle line:90%
into our physical world?

00:22:24.310 --> 00:22:27.010 align:middle line:84%
Well, this is where
scientists now

00:22:27.010 --> 00:22:28.990 align:middle line:84%
are struggling
because what they're

00:22:28.990 --> 00:22:33.640 align:middle line:84%
telling us is that these
relationships of entanglement,

00:22:33.640 --> 00:22:36.140 align:middle line:84%
although they happen
on a quantum level,

00:22:36.140 --> 00:22:39.760 align:middle line:84%
that they don't apply to us
on the larger physical level,

00:22:39.760 --> 00:22:44.230 align:middle line:84%
even though we are made of
the stuff, the photons that

00:22:44.230 --> 00:22:48.344 align:middle line:84%
are having the experiences
on the quantum level.

00:22:48.344 --> 00:22:50.760 align:middle line:84%
>>RICHARD FEYNMAN: The other
part said, well, this kind, I

00:22:50.760 --> 00:22:52.870 align:middle line:90%
hope you'll come along with me.

00:22:52.870 --> 00:22:55.000 align:middle line:84%
And you'll have to
accept it because it's

00:22:55.000 --> 00:22:56.460 align:middle line:90%
the way nature works.

00:22:56.460 --> 00:22:58.080 align:middle line:84%
If you want to
know the way nature

00:22:58.080 --> 00:23:01.140 align:middle line:84%
works-- we looked
at it carefully.

00:23:01.140 --> 00:23:01.940 align:middle line:90%
Look at it.

00:23:01.940 --> 00:23:03.440 align:middle line:90%
That's the way it looks.

00:23:03.440 --> 00:23:06.660 align:middle line:84%
If you don't like it,
go somewhere else.

00:23:06.660 --> 00:23:07.740 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:23:07.740 --> 00:23:09.917 align:middle line:84%
To another universe where
the rules are simpler.

00:23:09.917 --> 00:23:11.050 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:23:11.050 --> 00:23:12.480 align:middle line:90%


00:23:12.480 --> 00:23:14.040 align:middle line:84%
>>GREGG: The
twin-photon experiment

00:23:14.040 --> 00:23:18.180 align:middle line:84%
helps us to understand two
things-- number one, why

00:23:18.180 --> 00:23:21.450 align:middle line:84%
all matter was originally
connected when the universe was

00:23:21.450 --> 00:23:24.730 align:middle line:84%
formed some 14 billion
years ago to begin with,

00:23:24.730 --> 00:23:27.960 align:middle line:84%
and number two, why
that connection still

00:23:27.960 --> 00:23:31.075 align:middle line:84%
exists in our world
and in our lives today.

00:23:31.075 --> 00:23:33.170 align:middle line:84%
But I want you to know
that the field does

00:23:33.170 --> 00:23:36.470 align:middle line:84%
more than just connect
things through entanglement.

00:23:36.470 --> 00:23:38.115 align:middle line:84%
There's another
quality of the field

00:23:38.115 --> 00:23:39.490 align:middle line:84%
that we haven't
talked about yet.

00:23:39.490 --> 00:23:42.860 align:middle line:84%
It's one that empowers us to
make big changes in the world

00:23:42.860 --> 00:23:45.830 align:middle line:84%
and in our lives
quickly and easily,

00:23:45.830 --> 00:23:49.940 align:middle line:84%
but only if we understand
how this principle works.

00:23:49.940 --> 00:23:52.400 align:middle line:84%
The quality that I am
talking to you about right

00:23:52.400 --> 00:23:55.610 align:middle line:84%
now is that the field
is not only entangled,

00:23:55.610 --> 00:23:56.850 align:middle line:90%
it is holographic.

00:23:56.850 --> 00:23:59.120 align:middle line:90%
And here's what I mean by that.

00:23:59.120 --> 00:24:04.550 align:middle line:84%
In the true hologram, each
fragment of a something

00:24:04.550 --> 00:24:08.750 align:middle line:84%
is a mirror of that
whole something.

00:24:08.750 --> 00:24:11.870 align:middle line:84%
A beautiful example of
what this principle is

00:24:11.870 --> 00:24:14.450 align:middle line:90%
is the holographic bookmarks.

00:24:14.450 --> 00:24:17.600 align:middle line:84%
In the 1980s, these
bookmarks were very popular.

00:24:17.600 --> 00:24:21.590 align:middle line:84%
They were thin foil
strips, silver strips.

00:24:21.590 --> 00:24:23.240 align:middle line:84%
And they had beautiful
images on them.

00:24:23.240 --> 00:24:24.739 align:middle line:84%
The three that I
remember the most--

00:24:24.739 --> 00:24:27.320 align:middle line:84%
there was one that was
an image of Mother Mary.

00:24:27.320 --> 00:24:31.820 align:middle line:84%
One was an image of a dolphin
jumping over the great Pyramid

00:24:31.820 --> 00:24:33.260 align:middle line:90%
of Giza in Egypt.

00:24:33.260 --> 00:24:38.630 align:middle line:84%
One of them was a rosebud that
looked like it was opening.

00:24:38.630 --> 00:24:41.460 align:middle line:84%
And the thing is, if you
would hold these books

00:24:41.460 --> 00:24:43.190 align:middle line:84%
strips in your
hand under a light,

00:24:43.190 --> 00:24:44.460 align:middle line:90%
the images would come alive.

00:24:44.460 --> 00:24:48.020 align:middle line:84%
They would look like they were
hovering above your hand, not

00:24:48.020 --> 00:24:50.450 align:middle line:90%
a flat two-dimensional image.

00:24:50.450 --> 00:24:54.640 align:middle line:84%
Well, here is the thing
about a hologram--

00:24:54.640 --> 00:24:56.600 align:middle line:84%
and as I mentioned,
in a hologram,

00:24:56.600 --> 00:25:01.160 align:middle line:84%
every piece of the
hologram mirrors the whole.

00:25:01.160 --> 00:25:04.490 align:middle line:84%
So taking that principle and
applying it to our bookmarks.

00:25:04.490 --> 00:25:06.410 align:middle line:84%
If you were to take
a pair of scissors

00:25:06.410 --> 00:25:09.410 align:middle line:84%
and cut your beautiful
holographic bookmark

00:25:09.410 --> 00:25:13.910 align:middle line:84%
of the Great Pyramid or of
the rose into a billion pieces

00:25:13.910 --> 00:25:15.740 align:middle line:90%
of any shape and size.

00:25:15.740 --> 00:25:20.000 align:middle line:84%
And if you took the smallest
one of those fragments

00:25:20.000 --> 00:25:21.920 align:middle line:84%
and you put it
under a microscope.

00:25:21.920 --> 00:25:25.850 align:middle line:84%
And you took a razor blade
and you cut it yet again.

00:25:25.850 --> 00:25:29.240 align:middle line:84%
In that smallest fragment
of that hologram when

00:25:29.240 --> 00:25:31.530 align:middle line:84%
you look at it under
the microscope,

00:25:31.530 --> 00:25:35.980 align:middle line:84%
you would see the entire pattern
again, and again, and again.

00:25:35.980 --> 00:25:38.520 align:middle line:90%
And this is the beauty.

00:25:38.520 --> 00:25:39.420 align:middle line:90%
This is the value.

00:25:39.420 --> 00:25:43.220 align:middle line:84%
And this is the power of
the holographic principle.

00:25:43.220 --> 00:25:48.260 align:middle line:84%
Because what it says to us is
when we make a change anywhere

00:25:48.260 --> 00:25:51.680 align:middle line:84%
in that hologram, in
one place, that change

00:25:51.680 --> 00:25:54.950 align:middle line:84%
is mirrored throughout
the rest of the hologram.

00:25:54.950 --> 00:25:57.050 align:middle line:84%
So if you were to
think of the universe.

00:25:57.050 --> 00:26:01.140 align:middle line:84%
For example, think of
the universe as a whole.

00:26:01.140 --> 00:26:03.700 align:middle line:84%
And if you cut the
universe in half.

00:26:03.700 --> 00:26:05.590 align:middle line:84%
And then you cut
that in half again.

00:26:05.590 --> 00:26:08.290 align:middle line:84%
And you did it again,
and again, and again.

00:26:08.290 --> 00:26:11.020 align:middle line:84%
And you made a
change in one place

00:26:11.020 --> 00:26:16.450 align:middle line:84%
in the universe on the level
that the holograph recognizes,

00:26:16.450 --> 00:26:19.900 align:middle line:84%
that change would be
mirrored throughout the rest

00:26:19.900 --> 00:26:21.100 align:middle line:90%
of the universe.

00:26:21.100 --> 00:26:24.400 align:middle line:84%
You would not have to go
to every physical location

00:26:24.400 --> 00:26:28.090 align:middle line:84%
in the universe to replicate,
to duplicate that change again

00:26:28.090 --> 00:26:29.020 align:middle line:90%
and again.

00:26:29.020 --> 00:26:30.880 align:middle line:84%
So I think you're
beginning to see

00:26:30.880 --> 00:26:35.290 align:middle line:84%
why the principle of the
hologram is so very powerful.

00:26:35.290 --> 00:26:37.670 align:middle line:84%
So with this holographic
principle in mind

00:26:37.670 --> 00:26:40.750 align:middle line:84%
and what we have just discovered
with our little bookmark,

00:26:40.750 --> 00:26:43.440 align:middle line:84%
let's go back to the
twin-photon experiment.

00:26:43.440 --> 00:26:45.490 align:middle line:84%
And now we can
answer the question

00:26:45.490 --> 00:26:48.650 align:middle line:84%
that we asked at the
beginning of the experiment.

00:26:48.650 --> 00:26:51.200 align:middle line:84%
What happened in
that experiment?

00:26:51.200 --> 00:26:57.160 align:middle line:84%
What was it that allowed one of
the twin photons 14 miles away

00:26:57.160 --> 00:27:02.230 align:middle line:84%
to act as if it were having
the same experience as its twin

00:27:02.230 --> 00:27:04.300 align:middle line:84%
in the same instant
in time without being

00:27:04.300 --> 00:27:05.590 align:middle line:90%
physically disturbed?

00:27:05.590 --> 00:27:07.440 align:middle line:90%
Why did that happen?

00:27:07.440 --> 00:27:10.330 align:middle line:84%
Well, we said, number one,
that the two are connected

00:27:10.330 --> 00:27:11.830 align:middle line:90%
because of the entanglement.

00:27:11.830 --> 00:27:13.510 align:middle line:90%
That's the connection.

00:27:13.510 --> 00:27:16.240 align:middle line:84%
But to actually
mirror what it is

00:27:16.240 --> 00:27:18.790 align:middle line:84%
that's happening in
one place or another,

00:27:18.790 --> 00:27:22.810 align:middle line:84%
scientists typically have
thought in a linear fashion.

00:27:22.810 --> 00:27:24.250 align:middle line:90%
And here's what I mean by that.

00:27:24.250 --> 00:27:28.330 align:middle line:84%
Traditionally, if we
disturb physical matter,

00:27:28.330 --> 00:27:31.340 align:middle line:84%
if we disturb that
photon in one place,

00:27:31.340 --> 00:27:34.840 align:middle line:84%
and we're seeing another
photon act as if it just

00:27:34.840 --> 00:27:37.150 align:middle line:84%
had the same
experience, a scientist

00:27:37.150 --> 00:27:39.160 align:middle line:84%
thinking in a
linear fashion would

00:27:39.160 --> 00:27:41.500 align:middle line:84%
say this-- the
scientist would say,

00:27:41.500 --> 00:27:45.190 align:middle line:84%
how did the information of the
disturbance get from point A

00:27:45.190 --> 00:27:46.270 align:middle line:90%
to point B?

00:27:46.270 --> 00:27:49.780 align:middle line:84%
How was it transmitted
from point A to point B?

00:27:49.780 --> 00:27:54.490 align:middle line:84%
Thinking that it would have
to go across time and space

00:27:54.490 --> 00:27:56.380 align:middle line:90%
to get to that place?

00:27:56.380 --> 00:28:01.390 align:middle line:84%
Or here is where the scientists
ran into a big brick wall.

00:28:01.390 --> 00:28:05.860 align:middle line:84%
Because they used atomic
clocks to measure the timing.

00:28:05.860 --> 00:28:10.450 align:middle line:84%
How much time lapsed between
the time one of the twin photons

00:28:10.450 --> 00:28:14.800 align:middle line:84%
had its experience and the
other 14 miles away mirrored

00:28:14.800 --> 00:28:17.020 align:middle line:90%
that experience?

00:28:17.020 --> 00:28:20.140 align:middle line:84%
And what they found was that
there was no time difference,

00:28:20.140 --> 00:28:21.070 align:middle line:90%
no time lag.

00:28:21.070 --> 00:28:22.660 align:middle line:90%
It was simultaneous.

00:28:22.660 --> 00:28:26.260 align:middle line:84%
The instant, the nano-instant
that one of these photons

00:28:26.260 --> 00:28:28.750 align:middle line:84%
is having an experience,
the other one is as well.

00:28:28.750 --> 00:28:31.270 align:middle line:84%
So now, the
holographic principle

00:28:31.270 --> 00:28:33.160 align:middle line:84%
tells us what it is
that's happening.

00:28:33.160 --> 00:28:35.200 align:middle line:84%
And it's actually
a trick question.

00:28:35.200 --> 00:28:39.370 align:middle line:84%
How did the information get
from photon one to photon two?

00:28:39.370 --> 00:28:40.870 align:middle line:90%
Or did it?

00:28:40.870 --> 00:28:44.050 align:middle line:84%
And the answer is it didn't
have to travel anywhere.

00:28:44.050 --> 00:28:48.380 align:middle line:84%
Because in the hologram, the
information is already there.

00:28:48.380 --> 00:28:49.270 align:middle line:90%
It's already there.

00:28:49.270 --> 00:28:53.800 align:middle line:84%
In the hologram,
here equals there.

00:28:53.800 --> 00:28:57.130 align:middle line:84%
And this is the very,
very powerful principle.

00:28:57.130 --> 00:29:01.270 align:middle line:84%
If we can embrace this in our
lives on the energetic level,

00:29:01.270 --> 00:29:04.900 align:middle line:84%
this is the principle that
allows us as individuals

00:29:04.900 --> 00:29:08.500 align:middle line:84%
to create tremendous change in
our bodies and in our lives.

00:29:08.500 --> 00:29:10.450 align:middle line:90%
Now, here's the way it works.

00:29:10.450 --> 00:29:15.160 align:middle line:84%
The old way of thinking told
us that to create change

00:29:15.160 --> 00:29:18.930 align:middle line:84%
we must make that change
happen one person at a time

00:29:18.930 --> 00:29:21.250 align:middle line:90%
or one thing at a time.

00:29:21.250 --> 00:29:23.590 align:middle line:84%
But now we know, that's
not really the case.

00:29:23.590 --> 00:29:27.430 align:middle line:84%
We don't need to make
the change itself happen,

00:29:27.430 --> 00:29:31.280 align:middle line:84%
we can accomplish positive
change in our world

00:29:31.280 --> 00:29:33.970 align:middle line:84%
and in our lives
through demonstrating

00:29:33.970 --> 00:29:38.620 align:middle line:84%
a personal shift in thinking,
a shift that is reflected

00:29:38.620 --> 00:29:41.500 align:middle line:84%
holographically in
the field, as people

00:29:41.500 --> 00:29:44.410 align:middle line:84%
like Nelson Mandela, Mother
Teresa, Mahatma Gandhi,

00:29:44.410 --> 00:29:47.020 align:middle line:90%
and John F Kennedy showed us.

00:29:47.020 --> 00:29:50.560 align:middle line:84%
They shifted their beliefs
and their thinking.

00:29:50.560 --> 00:29:53.290 align:middle line:10%
And they shared it in an
honest, truthful, factual way

00:29:53.290 --> 00:29:54.340 align:middle line:10%
in the world.

00:29:54.340 --> 00:29:57.040 align:middle line:10%
And the world embraced that
change and mirrored it.

00:29:57.040 --> 00:30:00.430 align:middle line:84%
They did not have to go
to one person at a time

00:30:00.430 --> 00:30:04.060 align:middle line:84%
and make one change after
another, after another.

00:30:04.060 --> 00:30:06.700 align:middle line:90%
I'm describing here a mechanism.

00:30:06.700 --> 00:30:11.350 align:middle line:84%
It gives us the words to
explain seemingly miraculous

00:30:11.350 --> 00:30:14.720 align:middle line:84%
experiences that we
find in our lives,

00:30:14.720 --> 00:30:18.400 align:middle line:84%
so for example, when our
prayers benefit our loved ones,

00:30:18.400 --> 00:30:20.410 align:middle line:84%
whether we're sitting
together in the same room

00:30:20.410 --> 00:30:22.990 align:middle line:90%
or they're half a world away.

00:30:22.990 --> 00:30:26.170 align:middle line:84%
What we know is
that on the deepest

00:30:26.170 --> 00:30:30.370 align:middle line:84%
connection of our truest
essence, we are connected

00:30:30.370 --> 00:30:32.290 align:middle line:90%
and we are entangled.

00:30:32.290 --> 00:30:36.700 align:middle line:84%
And the holographic principle
allows us to love one another

00:30:36.700 --> 00:30:41.200 align:middle line:84%
and to share that love in ways
that we only dreamed possible

00:30:41.200 --> 00:30:43.030 align:middle line:84%
before we understood
this principle.

00:30:43.030 --> 00:30:47.170 align:middle line:84%
And we're learning to now
apply this scientifically.

00:30:47.170 --> 00:30:51.370 align:middle line:84%
So at the instant of the Big
Bang, all matter was connected.

00:30:51.370 --> 00:30:54.354 align:middle line:84%
The question is, are
we still connected?

00:30:54.354 --> 00:30:56.020 align:middle line:84%
Well, the evidence
suggests that we are,

00:30:56.020 --> 00:30:57.820 align:middle line:84%
but the question
is, how connected?

00:30:57.820 --> 00:30:59.560 align:middle line:84%
What is our relationship
to the field?

00:30:59.560 --> 00:31:01.370 align:middle line:90%
What does that really mean?

00:31:01.370 --> 00:31:04.420 align:middle line:84%
In our next episode, we'll let
science answer this question

00:31:04.420 --> 00:31:08.230 align:middle line:84%
with two paradigm
shattering experiments.
