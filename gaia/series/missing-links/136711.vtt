[THEME MUSIC]

00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:26.276 align:middle line:84%
>>GREGG BRADEN: My
name's Gregg Braden.

00:00:26.276 --> 00:00:29.279 align:middle line:84%
And I'd like to welcome you to
this very special presentation

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:33.367 align:middle line:84%
of "Missing Links, the Deep
Truth of our Origin, History,

00:00:33.367 --> 00:00:35.035 align:middle line:90%
Destiny and Fate".

00:00:35.035 --> 00:00:37.162 align:middle line:84%
In the last episode,
we discovered

00:00:37.162 --> 00:00:40.791 align:middle line:84%
how the best science of the
20th and now the 21st century

00:00:40.791 --> 00:00:45.629 align:middle line:84%
has overturned the key tenet
of Darwin's idea of evolution,

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:48.173 align:middle line:90%
survival of the strongest.

00:00:48.173 --> 00:00:50.842 align:middle line:84%
Now we know that
nature is actually

00:00:50.842 --> 00:00:54.096 align:middle line:84%
based upon a model of
cooperation and mutual aid, not

00:00:54.096 --> 00:00:56.473 align:middle line:84%
the competition and
conflict and the struggle

00:00:56.473 --> 00:00:58.976 align:middle line:84%
that we've been led to
believe in the past.

00:00:58.976 --> 00:01:02.396 align:middle line:84%
Well, in this episode we'll
take this idea one step further.

00:01:02.396 --> 00:01:05.399 align:middle line:84%
We'll explore the science,
the new science that

00:01:05.399 --> 00:01:08.944 align:middle line:84%
takes our personal connection
to the earth to the most

00:01:08.944 --> 00:01:10.654 align:middle line:90%
intimate level yet.

00:01:10.654 --> 00:01:14.116 align:middle line:84%
And it all begins with what
you've already learned,

00:01:14.116 --> 00:01:18.620 align:middle line:84%
the harmony between our
heart and our brain.

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:20.497 align:middle line:84%
Throughout this
series, there have

00:01:20.497 --> 00:01:21.957 align:middle line:84%
been some common
themes that have

00:01:21.957 --> 00:01:24.584 align:middle line:90%
woven each episode together.

00:01:24.584 --> 00:01:27.754 align:middle line:84%
One of those themes is that we
are living a time of extremes,

00:01:27.754 --> 00:01:30.799 align:middle line:84%
a rare convergence of cycles
that are changing our world

00:01:30.799 --> 00:01:34.928 align:middle line:84%
and the way that we need to
think and live in our world.

00:01:34.928 --> 00:01:37.889 align:middle line:84%
Another theme is that those
who have come before us,

00:01:37.889 --> 00:01:41.351 align:middle line:84%
our ancestors, they understood
these cycles of time

00:01:41.351 --> 00:01:42.769 align:middle line:84%
and they understood
that they would

00:01:42.769 --> 00:01:45.521 align:middle line:84%
need to change their
lives in order to embrace

00:01:45.521 --> 00:01:46.732 align:middle line:90%
that change in a healthy way.

00:01:46.732 --> 00:01:50.860 align:middle line:84%
And they left us the keys to
help us to do that in our time

00:01:50.860 --> 00:01:52.029 align:middle line:90%
today.

00:01:52.029 --> 00:01:54.740 align:middle line:84%
And another one
of those themes is

00:01:54.740 --> 00:02:00.412 align:middle line:84%
that we are the product
of something that

00:02:00.412 --> 00:02:03.498 align:middle line:90%
is so mysterious in our past.

00:02:03.498 --> 00:02:07.461 align:middle line:10%
It is the union, the
merging, the fusion

00:02:07.461 --> 00:02:11.214 align:middle line:10%
of DNA, the DNA that
makes us who we are,

00:02:11.214 --> 00:02:16.511 align:middle line:10%
human chromosome number 2, and
the fusion of those telomeres

00:02:16.511 --> 00:02:21.808 align:middle line:10%
that created within us the
ability to experience life

00:02:21.808 --> 00:02:24.561 align:middle line:10%
in this world in a way that
no other life can experience

00:02:24.561 --> 00:02:28.648 align:middle line:10%
in this world, the ability to
tap our intuition on demand,

00:02:28.648 --> 00:02:30.650 align:middle line:10%
to access our
subconscious on demand,

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:35.572 align:middle line:10%
to turn on our immune response,
to tap that anti-aging hormone

00:02:35.572 --> 00:02:38.200 align:middle line:10%
response, and much, much more.

00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:41.787 align:middle line:84%
One of the pieces that we
have not yet talked about

00:02:41.787 --> 00:02:43.997 align:middle line:84%
is something that I want to
share with you right now.

00:02:43.997 --> 00:02:45.415 align:middle line:84%
And although that
we're sharing it

00:02:45.415 --> 00:02:47.334 align:middle line:84%
at this point in
the program, it is

00:02:47.334 --> 00:02:49.668 align:middle line:84%
a principle that applies to
every episode that we've had

00:02:49.668 --> 00:02:50.921 align:middle line:90%
so far.

00:02:50.921 --> 00:02:53.131 align:middle line:90%
It's all about resilience.

00:02:53.131 --> 00:02:58.929 align:middle line:84%
Resilience is our ability
to embrace big change

00:02:58.929 --> 00:03:00.597 align:middle line:90%
in a healthy way.

00:03:00.597 --> 00:03:03.141 align:middle line:84%
When we talk about
personal resilience,

00:03:03.141 --> 00:03:05.811 align:middle line:84%
you can actually think
of it as the batteries.

00:03:05.811 --> 00:03:08.688 align:middle line:84%
You can think of it as
the emotional batteries,

00:03:08.688 --> 00:03:12.275 align:middle line:84%
the psychological batteries,
even the physical batteries

00:03:12.275 --> 00:03:14.736 align:middle line:84%
in your body, and
the charge that

00:03:14.736 --> 00:03:18.573 align:middle line:84%
needs to be maintained so
that you can respond to life

00:03:18.573 --> 00:03:22.411 align:middle line:84%
in a healthy, in a healthy
way when the universe brings

00:03:22.411 --> 00:03:23.829 align:middle line:90%
change right to your doorstep.

00:03:23.829 --> 00:03:26.373 align:middle line:84%
Now we don't always know what's
going to happen in the world.

00:03:26.373 --> 00:03:29.167 align:middle line:84%
And we can't always
determine what the world

00:03:29.167 --> 00:03:30.252 align:middle line:90%
is going to bring to us.

00:03:30.252 --> 00:03:32.921 align:middle line:84%
But we can, with
absolute certainty,

00:03:32.921 --> 00:03:36.716 align:middle line:84%
determine how we respond to
what the world shows to us.

00:03:36.716 --> 00:03:39.094 align:middle line:84%
Because as we
master the potential

00:03:39.094 --> 00:03:43.515 align:middle line:84%
for tremendous super
resilience within ourselves,

00:03:43.515 --> 00:03:45.016 align:middle line:90%
we feel confident.

00:03:45.016 --> 00:03:47.060 align:middle line:84%
It gives us the
confidence that we

00:03:47.060 --> 00:03:48.895 align:middle line:84%
can embrace whatever
change the world brings

00:03:48.895 --> 00:03:51.648 align:middle line:84%
to us in a healthy way and
we can do it again and again

00:03:51.648 --> 00:03:52.482 align:middle line:90%
and again.

00:03:52.482 --> 00:03:54.192 align:middle line:84%
So I want to be
really clear with you

00:03:54.192 --> 00:03:56.486 align:middle line:84%
about where I'm
coming from on this.

00:03:56.486 --> 00:03:58.447 align:middle line:84%
You already have
resilience in your life.

00:03:58.447 --> 00:03:59.823 align:middle line:90%
We all do.

00:03:59.823 --> 00:04:02.367 align:middle line:84%
You have the resilience
that's helped you,

00:04:02.367 --> 00:04:06.538 align:middle line:84%
to this moment in your life, to
deal with whatever changes life

00:04:06.538 --> 00:04:08.290 align:middle line:90%
has brought to you.

00:04:08.290 --> 00:04:12.544 align:middle line:84%
But if you can think of
resilience as a curve,

00:04:12.544 --> 00:04:18.425 align:middle line:84%
what researchers tell us is
that we embrace change typically

00:04:18.425 --> 00:04:23.930 align:middle line:84%
in a way that follows a curve in
a very specific way over about

00:04:23.930 --> 00:04:26.016 align:middle line:90%
a 60-day period.

00:04:26.016 --> 00:04:28.560 align:middle line:84%
When we're faced with a
new challenge in our lives,

00:04:28.560 --> 00:04:31.730 align:middle line:84%
something unexpected comes up,
the caring for an aging parent,

00:04:31.730 --> 00:04:34.441 align:middle line:84%
for example, the
loss of a loved one,

00:04:34.441 --> 00:04:36.026 align:middle line:84%
those are negative
experiences, but it

00:04:36.026 --> 00:04:38.111 align:middle line:90%
can be positive experiences.

00:04:38.111 --> 00:04:42.949 align:middle line:84%
The embracing of a new job, the
embracing of a new discovery

00:04:42.949 --> 00:04:45.118 align:middle line:84%
and carrying that discovery
out in the stages all

00:04:45.118 --> 00:04:46.203 align:middle line:90%
over the world.

00:04:46.203 --> 00:04:48.538 align:middle line:10%
All of those require resilience.

00:04:48.538 --> 00:04:50.540 align:middle line:84%
Here's what the
researchers tell us.

00:04:50.540 --> 00:04:53.335 align:middle line:84%
In that curve of
resilience, typically when

00:04:53.335 --> 00:04:56.004 align:middle line:84%
we're faced with a new
challenge, good or bad, what

00:04:56.004 --> 00:04:59.966 align:middle line:84%
we do is about the first
10 days of that challenge,

00:04:59.966 --> 00:05:00.926 align:middle line:90%
we're up for it.

00:05:00.926 --> 00:05:02.677 align:middle line:84%
We've got the emotional,
the psychological

00:05:02.677 --> 00:05:04.012 align:middle line:90%
and the physical energy.

00:05:04.012 --> 00:05:05.305 align:middle line:10%
And the curve is a steep curve.

00:05:05.305 --> 00:05:07.265 align:middle line:10%
It looks like this.

00:05:07.265 --> 00:05:10.310 align:middle line:84%
Something begins to happen
after about that 10 days.

00:05:10.310 --> 00:05:15.023 align:middle line:84%
Because we cannot sustain that
level of intensity for long

00:05:15.023 --> 00:05:17.901 align:middle line:84%
periods of time, typically--
everyone's different--

00:05:17.901 --> 00:05:20.654 align:middle line:90%
typically, we begin to plateau.

00:05:20.654 --> 00:05:23.990 align:middle line:84%
We see that plateau and
our energy levels even out.

00:05:23.990 --> 00:05:26.701 align:middle line:10%
And if we are not
trained, if we don't

00:05:26.701 --> 00:05:29.120 align:middle line:10%
know how to manage
that resilience,

00:05:29.120 --> 00:05:31.748 align:middle line:10%
our energy levels begin
to drop off very quickly,

00:05:31.748 --> 00:05:34.125 align:middle line:10%
and we call it
emotional exhaustion.

00:05:34.125 --> 00:05:37.254 align:middle line:10%
Now I know this
personally in my own life.

00:05:37.254 --> 00:05:39.381 align:middle line:90%
My mother's health has declined.

00:05:39.381 --> 00:05:42.342 align:middle line:84%
And it happened faster than
I expected it to happen,

00:05:42.342 --> 00:05:43.677 align:middle line:90%
and it happened sooner in life.

00:05:43.677 --> 00:05:46.221 align:middle line:84%
I always thought we'd have
a lot more time together.

00:05:46.221 --> 00:05:47.138 align:middle line:90%
I'm a researcher.

00:05:47.138 --> 00:05:47.931 align:middle line:90%
I'm a scientist.

00:05:47.931 --> 00:05:49.015 align:middle line:90%
I'm a scholar.

00:05:49.015 --> 00:05:52.227 align:middle line:84%
So when I first saw the signs of
what was happening with my mom,

00:05:52.227 --> 00:05:53.937 align:middle line:90%
I was all over the information.

00:05:53.937 --> 00:05:55.814 align:middle line:84%
I was on the
internet every night,

00:05:55.814 --> 00:06:00.485 align:middle line:84%
researching what's been
discovered, what can we do.

00:06:00.485 --> 00:06:02.237 align:middle line:84%
Is there anything
that we can do?

00:06:02.237 --> 00:06:04.531 align:middle line:84%
And I followed this
curve almost to a T.

00:06:04.531 --> 00:06:07.117 align:middle line:84%
That first week or 10
days, my energy levels,

00:06:07.117 --> 00:06:08.159 align:middle line:90%
tremendously high.

00:06:08.159 --> 00:06:10.412 align:middle line:90%
Then I began to plateau.

00:06:10.412 --> 00:06:12.163 align:middle line:90%
And I could feel it in my body.

00:06:12.163 --> 00:06:13.623 align:middle line:90%
But here's the key.

00:06:13.623 --> 00:06:15.542 align:middle line:84%
Where some people
would drop off quickly

00:06:15.542 --> 00:06:18.420 align:middle line:84%
with emotional exhaustion,
I had the benefit

00:06:18.420 --> 00:06:21.298 align:middle line:84%
of the tools that you
now have, as well.

00:06:21.298 --> 00:06:24.092 align:middle line:84%
Because the heart-brain
harmony that we have already

00:06:24.092 --> 00:06:26.469 align:middle line:84%
experienced and that you've
learned the techniques

00:06:26.469 --> 00:06:28.763 align:middle line:84%
for in previous
episodes, that is

00:06:28.763 --> 00:06:33.393 align:middle line:84%
the harmony that also gives
us greater resilience in life.

00:06:33.393 --> 00:06:36.605 align:middle line:84%
I practice, in my life,
what I share with you.

00:06:36.605 --> 00:06:39.608 align:middle line:84%
And because I did,
this is the result.

00:06:39.608 --> 00:06:43.028 align:middle line:84%
While you still have
a curve of resilience,

00:06:43.028 --> 00:06:46.740 align:middle line:84%
the heart-brain harmony
allows us to raise

00:06:46.740 --> 00:06:48.575 align:middle line:90%
that curve in our life.

00:06:48.575 --> 00:06:52.871 align:middle line:84%
It allows us to sustain,
in a healthy way, the way

00:06:52.871 --> 00:06:55.290 align:middle line:84%
that we are dealing
with that change.

00:06:55.290 --> 00:06:59.085 align:middle line:84%
And it all comes down to
how we deal with resilience

00:06:59.085 --> 00:07:01.046 align:middle line:84%
and what it actually
means in our lives.

00:07:01.046 --> 00:07:04.466 align:middle line:84%
And this is what I want to
talk to you about right now.

00:07:04.466 --> 00:07:06.885 align:middle line:84%
Because this idea of resilience,
it means different things

00:07:06.885 --> 00:07:08.261 align:middle line:90%
to different people.

00:07:08.261 --> 00:07:10.930 align:middle line:84%
I want to get right to
the heart of resilience.

00:07:10.930 --> 00:07:15.560 align:middle line:84%
Not surprisingly, resilience
begins in your heart.

00:07:15.560 --> 00:07:18.438 align:middle line:90%
It begins in the human heart.

00:07:18.438 --> 00:07:21.524 align:middle line:10%
If you've ever been
to a doctor and you've

00:07:21.524 --> 00:07:26.029 align:middle line:10%
had an electrocardiogram,
used to be called an EKG,

00:07:26.029 --> 00:07:29.866 align:middle line:10%
today they're called
ECGs, but they are still

00:07:29.866 --> 00:07:31.076 align:middle line:10%
the electrocardiogram.

00:07:31.076 --> 00:07:34.871 align:middle line:84%
It's the electrical
printout of your heartbeat.

00:07:34.871 --> 00:07:39.000 align:middle line:10%
And that printout will show
you a series of patterns.

00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:41.127 align:middle line:84%
The pattern has
a little squiggle

00:07:41.127 --> 00:07:42.879 align:middle line:84%
and then it has a
big spike and then it

00:07:42.879 --> 00:07:45.173 align:middle line:84%
drops and some more little
squiggles, a big spike,

00:07:45.173 --> 00:07:46.591 align:middle line:90%
and then it drops.

00:07:46.591 --> 00:07:49.177 align:middle line:84%
Those little squiggles,
that big spike, and the drop

00:07:49.177 --> 00:07:51.763 align:middle line:90%
is called the QRS complex.

00:07:51.763 --> 00:07:56.558 align:middle line:84%
Q, the letter Q, letter R,
and the letter S complex.

00:07:56.558 --> 00:08:00.355 align:middle line:84%
And the R is the
spike, the R wave.

00:08:00.355 --> 00:08:03.149 align:middle line:84%
Typically, if we don't know
what we're looking for--

00:08:03.149 --> 00:08:04.776 align:middle line:84%
and I see people do
this all the time--

00:08:04.776 --> 00:08:06.528 align:middle line:84%
if we don't know what
we're looking for

00:08:06.528 --> 00:08:11.449 align:middle line:84%
and you're lying there on the
cot in the doctor's office

00:08:11.449 --> 00:08:12.909 align:middle line:84%
and you turn your
head, because you

00:08:12.909 --> 00:08:15.620 align:middle line:84%
want to see what
your EKG looks like,

00:08:15.620 --> 00:08:19.874 align:middle line:84%
and we typically are expecting
this very regular rhythm.

00:08:19.874 --> 00:08:22.502 align:middle line:84%
We're saying, is my
heartbeat regular?

00:08:22.502 --> 00:08:25.463 align:middle line:84%
What you're looking
for is how much time

00:08:25.463 --> 00:08:29.801 align:middle line:84%
elapses from the peak of
one R wave to the next.

00:08:29.801 --> 00:08:34.097 align:middle line:84%
How much time, how
quickly one spike happens

00:08:34.097 --> 00:08:36.725 align:middle line:84%
and then the next spike
and the next spike.

00:08:36.725 --> 00:08:40.270 align:middle line:84%
Well, we typically are
looking for this regularity.

00:08:40.270 --> 00:08:42.272 align:middle line:84%
But the truth is, that's
probably the last thing

00:08:42.272 --> 00:08:43.606 align:middle line:90%
that you really want.

00:08:43.606 --> 00:08:45.316 align:middle line:90%
And here's the reason why.

00:08:45.316 --> 00:08:49.154 align:middle line:84%
Resilience is all about
the variability, not

00:08:49.154 --> 00:08:50.739 align:middle line:90%
the regularity.

00:08:50.739 --> 00:08:53.992 align:middle line:84%
The more variability
that you have

00:08:53.992 --> 00:08:57.454 align:middle line:84%
from one R wave to the next,
from one peak to the next

00:08:57.454 --> 00:08:59.205 align:middle line:84%
to the next, the
more variability

00:08:59.205 --> 00:09:03.251 align:middle line:84%
you have, the greater
your resilience to life.

00:09:03.251 --> 00:09:07.714 align:middle line:84%
The more heart rate
variability you have,

00:09:07.714 --> 00:09:10.383 align:middle line:84%
the greater your
resilience to life.

00:09:10.383 --> 00:09:12.677 align:middle line:84%
And it is actually called
heart rate variability,

00:09:12.677 --> 00:09:16.097 align:middle line:90%
or abbreviated H-R-V.

00:09:16.097 --> 00:09:19.225 align:middle line:84%
So this heart rate variability,
this idea of heart rate

00:09:19.225 --> 00:09:23.188 align:middle line:84%
variability, it changes
throughout our lives.

00:09:23.188 --> 00:09:24.814 align:middle line:90%
It changes over time.

00:09:24.814 --> 00:09:26.733 align:middle line:84%
But I want you to
know right now,

00:09:26.733 --> 00:09:28.359 align:middle line:84%
you are not locked
into that change.

00:09:28.359 --> 00:09:32.781 align:middle line:84%
You are not bound to the change
that we commonly see in people

00:09:32.781 --> 00:09:33.823 align:middle line:90%
as they get older.

00:09:33.823 --> 00:09:38.203 align:middle line:84%
It can happen if we do not do
anything to change our heart

00:09:38.203 --> 00:09:39.913 align:middle line:90%
rate variability.

00:09:39.913 --> 00:09:44.334 align:middle line:84%
So when we are young, when we
first come into this world,

00:09:44.334 --> 00:09:46.169 align:middle line:84%
we have to figure out
things really quickly.

00:09:46.169 --> 00:09:48.588 align:middle line:84%
We've got to respond to
the world really quickly.

00:09:48.588 --> 00:09:50.215 align:middle line:84%
And nature gives us
a way to do that.

00:09:50.215 --> 00:09:53.551 align:middle line:84%
And we do it by having high
heart rate variability.

00:09:53.551 --> 00:09:55.053 align:middle line:84%
When you first come
into this world,

00:09:55.053 --> 00:09:56.554 align:middle line:84%
you've got to figure
stuff out fast.

00:09:56.554 --> 00:09:59.307 align:middle line:84%
You have to figure
out, for example,

00:09:59.307 --> 00:10:01.935 align:middle line:84%
that not every dog in every
living room is as friendly,

00:10:01.935 --> 00:10:04.312 align:middle line:84%
maybe, as the dog
in your living room.

00:10:04.312 --> 00:10:07.440 align:middle line:84%
And you've got to figure
out when a stove top is hot

00:10:07.440 --> 00:10:08.650 align:middle line:90%
and when it's not.

00:10:08.650 --> 00:10:11.194 align:middle line:84%
Because sometimes it's hot,
but it's not glowing red,

00:10:11.194 --> 00:10:13.279 align:middle line:84%
and you don't always know
when that's going to be.

00:10:13.279 --> 00:10:16.115 align:middle line:84%
You've got to figure that
stuff out really quickly.

00:10:16.115 --> 00:10:20.453 align:middle line:84%
So nature gives you high heart
rate variability early in life.

00:10:20.453 --> 00:10:22.038 align:middle line:84%
And this is typically
what we see.

00:10:22.038 --> 00:10:24.123 align:middle line:84%
The younger that people
are, we generally

00:10:24.123 --> 00:10:26.209 align:middle line:84%
see more of this heart
rate variability.

00:10:26.209 --> 00:10:28.336 align:middle line:90%
But here's what happens.

00:10:28.336 --> 00:10:29.712 align:middle line:90%
As we get older--

00:10:29.712 --> 00:10:31.840 align:middle line:84%
and I know you've heard
this term before--

00:10:31.840 --> 00:10:36.636 align:middle line:84%
as we get older, the tendency is
that we become set in our ways.

00:10:36.636 --> 00:10:38.179 align:middle line:84%
Or another way to
think of that is we

00:10:38.179 --> 00:10:41.266 align:middle line:90%
become rigid in our thinking.

00:10:41.266 --> 00:10:44.727 align:middle line:84%
We expect the world to
behave in certain ways.

00:10:44.727 --> 00:10:47.981 align:middle line:84%
We expect people to do
things in a certain way.

00:10:47.981 --> 00:10:52.986 align:middle line:84%
And that expectation,
the emotional expectation

00:10:52.986 --> 00:10:57.031 align:middle line:84%
of the world being the
way it has always been,

00:10:57.031 --> 00:11:01.202 align:middle line:84%
translates into the
rhythm of our heart.

00:11:01.202 --> 00:11:04.831 align:middle line:84%
When we become rigid in our
thinking and our expectation,

00:11:04.831 --> 00:11:07.458 align:middle line:84%
our heartbeat
becomes more regular

00:11:07.458 --> 00:11:09.794 align:middle line:90%
and we lose the variability.

00:11:09.794 --> 00:11:12.755 align:middle line:84%
We lose our heart
rate variability.

00:11:12.755 --> 00:11:16.050 align:middle line:84%
And this is why change is
often hard for older people.

00:11:16.050 --> 00:11:19.053 align:middle line:90%
Not always, but it can be.

00:11:19.053 --> 00:11:22.765 align:middle line:84%
Tell you, one of the most
amazing examples of this for me

00:11:22.765 --> 00:11:25.018 align:middle line:90%
was my grandfather.

00:11:25.018 --> 00:11:27.854 align:middle line:84%
I was very close
to my grandfather.

00:11:27.854 --> 00:11:30.440 align:middle line:84%
My father left my family
when I was 10 years old.

00:11:30.440 --> 00:11:32.275 align:middle line:90%
I didn't know him very well.

00:11:32.275 --> 00:11:35.028 align:middle line:84%
And I became closer
to my grandfather

00:11:35.028 --> 00:11:37.447 align:middle line:84%
than I ever was to my father,
because I knew him longer,

00:11:37.447 --> 00:11:39.741 align:middle line:84%
and we shared
deeply, deep talks,

00:11:39.741 --> 00:11:41.451 align:middle line:84%
deep conversations
about the world

00:11:41.451 --> 00:11:43.620 align:middle line:90%
and the experiences of life.

00:11:43.620 --> 00:11:46.873 align:middle line:84%
And my grandfather lived
until he was 96 years old.

00:11:46.873 --> 00:11:48.790 align:middle line:84%
And I wasn't with him
the moment that he

00:11:48.790 --> 00:11:52.962 align:middle line:84%
died during his 96th year,
but I was with him the week

00:11:52.962 --> 00:11:54.255 align:middle line:90%
that he passed.

00:11:54.255 --> 00:11:56.174 align:middle line:84%
I didn't know that
he was going to pass.

00:11:56.174 --> 00:11:58.217 align:middle line:90%
He seemed OK when I saw him.

00:11:58.217 --> 00:12:01.137 align:middle line:84%
But I had a sense, maybe
something was going on.

00:12:01.137 --> 00:12:01.930 align:middle line:90%
And I asked him.

00:12:01.930 --> 00:12:04.515 align:middle line:84%
I happened to ask him
on that last visit,

00:12:04.515 --> 00:12:06.768 align:middle line:84%
I said, grandpa,
you're 96 years old,

00:12:06.768 --> 00:12:10.647 align:middle line:84%
you've seen 96 years of
change in this world.

00:12:10.647 --> 00:12:11.689 align:middle line:90%
What has it meant to you?

00:12:11.689 --> 00:12:13.650 align:middle line:90%
What can you tell me?

00:12:13.650 --> 00:12:16.569 align:middle line:84%
And he looked at me with
this look that he always had.

00:12:16.569 --> 00:12:18.696 align:middle line:84%
And when he would smile,
his ears would wiggle.

00:12:18.696 --> 00:12:20.531 align:middle line:90%
I remember it.

00:12:20.531 --> 00:12:21.950 align:middle line:90%
And I miss that.

00:12:21.950 --> 00:12:25.119 align:middle line:84%
But what he said to me, smiled,
his ears wiggled a little bit,

00:12:25.119 --> 00:12:29.499 align:middle line:84%
and he said, Gregg, there was a
time when this world made sense

00:12:29.499 --> 00:12:30.500 align:middle line:90%
to me.

00:12:30.500 --> 00:12:33.461 align:middle line:84%
He said, there was a time
that I felt like I belonged.

00:12:33.461 --> 00:12:35.088 align:middle line:90%
I understood the world.

00:12:35.088 --> 00:12:37.465 align:middle line:90%
I understood how things worked.

00:12:37.465 --> 00:12:40.760 align:middle line:84%
I understood the people around
me and the way they think,

00:12:40.760 --> 00:12:44.639 align:middle line:84%
because they think the
way that I was thinking.

00:12:44.639 --> 00:12:46.432 align:middle line:84%
He said, but then
something changed.

00:12:46.432 --> 00:12:48.476 align:middle line:90%
Something began to happen.

00:12:48.476 --> 00:12:51.562 align:middle line:84%
And it was right around
the time of World War II.

00:12:51.562 --> 00:12:53.898 align:middle line:84%
And I wasn't surprised
when I heard the timing,

00:12:53.898 --> 00:12:59.612 align:middle line:84%
because war typically
propels us with innovation

00:12:59.612 --> 00:13:01.656 align:middle line:84%
and new technology
and new discoveries

00:13:01.656 --> 00:13:03.199 align:middle line:84%
and new inventions
that quickly are

00:13:03.199 --> 00:13:05.410 align:middle line:90%
embraced by the general public.

00:13:05.410 --> 00:13:08.121 align:middle line:84%
And that's exactly what
happened in World War II.

00:13:08.121 --> 00:13:09.706 align:middle line:84%
All of a sudden,
we had technology

00:13:09.706 --> 00:13:12.125 align:middle line:90%
we had never had before.

00:13:12.125 --> 00:13:16.421 align:middle line:84%
And my grandfather could never
keep up with that technology.

00:13:16.421 --> 00:13:19.090 align:middle line:84%
He couldn't understand,
for example, simple things.

00:13:19.090 --> 00:13:21.968 align:middle line:84%
He couldn't understand how
you put a piece of paper

00:13:21.968 --> 00:13:25.388 align:middle line:84%
into a fax machine in
an office in one city

00:13:25.388 --> 00:13:26.931 align:middle line:84%
and that piece of
paper comes out,

00:13:26.931 --> 00:13:28.725 align:middle line:84%
and all the information
is there on the fax

00:13:28.725 --> 00:13:29.392 align:middle line:90%
machine in another city.

00:13:29.392 --> 00:13:30.560 align:middle line:90%
It didn't make sense to him.

00:13:30.560 --> 00:13:33.813 align:middle line:84%
Because digital data
never made sense to him.

00:13:33.813 --> 00:13:35.440 align:middle line:90%
Lasers didn't make sense to him.

00:13:35.440 --> 00:13:38.109 align:middle line:84%
Coherent light waves
didn't make sense.

00:13:38.109 --> 00:13:40.862 align:middle line:84%
The way that jet planes
fly, in his lifetime,

00:13:40.862 --> 00:13:44.115 align:middle line:84%
he went from no
planes to jumbo jets,

00:13:44.115 --> 00:13:47.285 align:middle line:84%
and he could never understand
how something that big

00:13:47.285 --> 00:13:50.288 align:middle line:84%
could move in the air and
contain the fuel that it takes

00:13:50.288 --> 00:13:52.081 align:middle line:90%
to move fast enough to do that.

00:13:52.081 --> 00:13:54.459 align:middle line:90%
He said, I got lost.

00:13:54.459 --> 00:13:56.461 align:middle line:84%
He said, Gregg, I
got lost in my world.

00:13:56.461 --> 00:13:59.130 align:middle line:84%
He said, I'm no longer
a part of this world.

00:13:59.130 --> 00:14:01.549 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't make sense
to me any longer.

00:14:01.549 --> 00:14:04.844 align:middle line:84%
And at the end of that
week, my grandfather died.

00:14:04.844 --> 00:14:08.639 align:middle line:84%
And he died feeling like a
stranger in his own world.

00:14:08.639 --> 00:14:10.266 align:middle line:84%
And then maybe that
feeling contributed

00:14:10.266 --> 00:14:11.476 align:middle line:90%
to why he was no longer here.

00:14:11.476 --> 00:14:13.519 align:middle line:84%
He didn't have the
feeling and the connection

00:14:13.519 --> 00:14:16.022 align:middle line:84%
and the will to be
here any longer.

00:14:16.022 --> 00:14:18.191 align:middle line:84%
So I'm saying this to you,
because change was hard

00:14:18.191 --> 00:14:21.819 align:middle line:84%
for my grandfather, always
very hard for my grandfather.

00:14:21.819 --> 00:14:23.863 align:middle line:90%
He was so rigid in his thinking.

00:14:23.863 --> 00:14:27.366 align:middle line:84%
He wanted the world to be the
way it was before World War II,

00:14:27.366 --> 00:14:29.160 align:middle line:84%
before all those
changes happened.

00:14:29.160 --> 00:14:31.204 align:middle line:84%
And he used to
fight that change.

00:14:31.204 --> 00:14:33.331 align:middle line:84%
His heart rate
variability, no surprise,

00:14:33.331 --> 00:14:34.749 align:middle line:84%
when I went with
him to the doctor

00:14:34.749 --> 00:14:39.087 align:middle line:84%
and I would see that EKG,
his heart rate variability

00:14:39.087 --> 00:14:41.214 align:middle line:90%
looked like endless squiggles.

00:14:41.214 --> 00:14:44.884 align:middle line:84%
They weren't the big, deep
heart waves of someone

00:14:44.884 --> 00:14:48.221 align:middle line:84%
who's younger can embrace
the change in a healthy way.

00:14:48.221 --> 00:14:53.017 align:middle line:84%
It was the heartbeat of someone
who's lived to see a long life

00:14:53.017 --> 00:14:57.188 align:middle line:84%
and is struggling with accepting
and embracing the world

00:14:57.188 --> 00:14:59.524 align:middle line:84%
as it is now being
presented to him.

00:14:59.524 --> 00:15:01.359 align:middle line:90%
So heart rate variability.

00:15:01.359 --> 00:15:02.443 align:middle line:90%
How do we change that?

00:15:02.443 --> 00:15:03.778 align:middle line:90%
Well, the good news is you can.

00:15:03.778 --> 00:15:05.238 align:middle line:84%
You can change at
any time in life.

00:15:05.238 --> 00:15:08.032 align:middle line:84%
My grandfather,
if he had chosen,

00:15:08.032 --> 00:15:10.201 align:middle line:84%
could have embraced that
heart rate variability

00:15:10.201 --> 00:15:13.663 align:middle line:84%
in his life and the ability
to change his own heart

00:15:13.663 --> 00:15:14.622 align:middle line:90%
rate variability.

00:15:14.622 --> 00:15:16.749 align:middle line:90%
And how do you do that?

00:15:16.749 --> 00:15:20.503 align:middle line:84%
As I mentioned just a moment
ago, you already know how.

00:15:20.503 --> 00:15:22.839 align:middle line:10%
When we harmonize our
heart and our brain

00:15:22.839 --> 00:15:26.050 align:middle line:10%
together, when we shift our
awareness and know our heart,

00:15:26.050 --> 00:15:30.513 align:middle line:10%
number one, when we slow
our breathing to about five

00:15:30.513 --> 00:15:32.932 align:middle line:10%
seconds in, five
seconds out, and we

00:15:32.932 --> 00:15:35.351 align:middle line:10%
breathe as if that breath is
coming from our heart, number

00:15:35.351 --> 00:15:40.648 align:middle line:10%
two, and we begin to feel
the feelings of coherence,

00:15:40.648 --> 00:15:46.279 align:middle line:10%
the feelings of gratitude,
appreciation, compassion, care,

00:15:46.279 --> 00:15:49.991 align:middle line:10%
those kinds of feelings,
and we establish

00:15:49.991 --> 00:15:52.285 align:middle line:10%
the communication between
the heart and the brain--

00:15:52.285 --> 00:15:56.372 align:middle line:10%
0.1 Hertz is the talk between
the heart and the brain--

00:15:56.372 --> 00:16:00.626 align:middle line:10%
when you can feel the
feelings create 0.1 Hertz,

00:16:00.626 --> 00:16:02.503 align:middle line:10%
you're harmonizing your
heart and your brain.

00:16:02.503 --> 00:16:06.215 align:middle line:84%
And in addition to everything
else that we've already said,

00:16:06.215 --> 00:16:08.676 align:middle line:84%
in addition to all of the
other benefits of intuition

00:16:08.676 --> 00:16:10.970 align:middle line:84%
and subconscious access
and all of those things,

00:16:10.970 --> 00:16:13.389 align:middle line:84%
super learning, triggering
the immune response,

00:16:13.389 --> 00:16:14.891 align:middle line:84%
triggering your
anti-aging hormones,

00:16:14.891 --> 00:16:16.767 align:middle line:84%
in addition to all
of those things,

00:16:16.767 --> 00:16:19.437 align:middle line:84%
you are creating more
resilience in your life.

00:16:19.437 --> 00:16:22.064 align:middle line:84%
The more you practice this
technique, the greater

00:16:22.064 --> 00:16:24.483 align:middle line:84%
resilience you
have in your life.

00:16:24.483 --> 00:16:27.069 align:middle line:84%
So I'd like to take
this conversation now

00:16:27.069 --> 00:16:30.156 align:middle line:90%
to an even deeper level.

00:16:30.156 --> 00:16:34.952 align:middle line:84%
By going deeper, it's
going to also go global.

00:16:34.952 --> 00:16:39.248 align:middle line:84%
Because what we now know is
that the act of us having

00:16:39.248 --> 00:16:42.835 align:middle line:84%
this experience, this
heart-brain harmony, not only

00:16:42.835 --> 00:16:46.589 align:middle line:84%
does it create coherence
within our bodies,

00:16:46.589 --> 00:16:49.717 align:middle line:84%
it is also the key
to creating coherence

00:16:49.717 --> 00:16:52.011 align:middle line:84%
in the field that
connects all things.

00:16:52.011 --> 00:16:53.804 align:middle line:84%
And as you'll see
in a moment, that

00:16:53.804 --> 00:16:55.389 align:middle line:90%
can be a really good thing.

00:16:55.389 --> 00:16:57.850 align:middle line:90%
Personal coherence is good.

00:16:57.850 --> 00:17:00.061 align:middle line:84%
We're talking about
global coherence,

00:17:00.061 --> 00:17:02.188 align:middle line:90%
and that's really good.

00:17:02.188 --> 00:17:05.900 align:middle line:84%
There is a magnetic field
that surrounds our planet.

00:17:05.900 --> 00:17:09.069 align:middle line:84%
And this magnetic field, the
magnetic field of the Earth, it

00:17:09.069 --> 00:17:11.113 align:middle line:90%
permeates all things.

00:17:11.113 --> 00:17:15.159 align:middle line:84%
Everything is part of this
magnetic field, every blade

00:17:15.159 --> 00:17:18.454 align:middle line:84%
of grass, every hamster,
every goldfish, every CEO

00:17:18.454 --> 00:17:21.874 align:middle line:84%
of every corporation, every
leader of every nation,

00:17:21.874 --> 00:17:24.585 align:middle line:84%
when it comes to the
magnetic fields of the Earth,

00:17:24.585 --> 00:17:28.381 align:middle line:84%
there is no them and
us, there is only we.

00:17:28.381 --> 00:17:31.342 align:middle line:84%
And that means we are all
connected by this field.

00:17:31.342 --> 00:17:33.094 align:middle line:84%
And what happens
in this field is

00:17:33.094 --> 00:17:35.054 align:middle line:90%
really important for all of us.

00:17:35.054 --> 00:17:37.306 align:middle line:90%
It's important to you and to me.

00:17:37.306 --> 00:17:39.850 align:middle line:84%
And it's important to the
scientists of the world who

00:17:39.850 --> 00:17:42.395 align:middle line:90%
monitor these kinds of things.

00:17:42.395 --> 00:17:45.564 align:middle line:84%
So right now, there
are two satellites

00:17:45.564 --> 00:17:47.483 align:middle line:90%
in the northern hemisphere.

00:17:47.483 --> 00:17:50.444 align:middle line:84%
And these are satellites
whose sole purpose

00:17:50.444 --> 00:17:52.655 align:middle line:84%
is to monitor the magnetic
fields of the Earth that

00:17:52.655 --> 00:17:54.073 align:middle line:90%
connect all things.

00:17:54.073 --> 00:17:56.575 align:middle line:84%
We want to know what's
happening to those fields.

00:17:56.575 --> 00:18:00.871 align:middle line:84%
The fields ebb and
flow over time.

00:18:00.871 --> 00:18:04.750 align:middle line:84%
And we're also discovering
now that these magnetic fields

00:18:04.750 --> 00:18:07.837 align:middle line:84%
of the Earth that
influence life on Earth

00:18:07.837 --> 00:18:09.505 align:middle line:84%
are influenced by
things that are not

00:18:09.505 --> 00:18:12.258 align:middle line:90%
on Earth, like solar cycles.

00:18:12.258 --> 00:18:15.553 align:middle line:84%
Earlier in this program,
in our very first episode,

00:18:15.553 --> 00:18:16.804 align:middle line:90%
you saw this.

00:18:16.804 --> 00:18:19.974 align:middle line:10%
You saw how scientists
were able to determine,

00:18:19.974 --> 00:18:24.895 align:middle line:10%
as the solar cycles
ebb and flow over time,

00:18:24.895 --> 00:18:29.567 align:middle line:10%
that human ingenuity, human
creativity, and big things

00:18:29.567 --> 00:18:31.610 align:middle line:10%
that humans have
created are directly

00:18:31.610 --> 00:18:34.780 align:middle line:10%
linked to the solar cycles.

00:18:34.780 --> 00:18:40.745 align:middle line:84%
The cycles of innovation
parallel the cycles of the sun

00:18:40.745 --> 00:18:42.496 align:middle line:90%
as they ebb and flow.

00:18:42.496 --> 00:18:44.040 align:middle line:90%
So you saw this.

00:18:44.040 --> 00:18:47.084 align:middle line:84%
But what you did not
see is why this happens.

00:18:47.084 --> 00:18:49.587 align:middle line:84%
Now that we've talked about the
magnetic fields of the Earth,

00:18:49.587 --> 00:18:51.505 align:middle line:84%
it's going to make
perfect sense.

00:18:51.505 --> 00:18:53.466 align:middle line:84%
Because the solar
cycles are also

00:18:53.466 --> 00:18:57.136 align:middle line:84%
based upon magnetic fields,
but they're on the sun.

00:18:57.136 --> 00:18:59.180 align:middle line:84%
When we talk about
sunspots, what

00:18:59.180 --> 00:19:01.182 align:middle line:84%
we see as sunspots
from the earth,

00:19:01.182 --> 00:19:04.852 align:middle line:84%
those spots are actually
magnetic fields on the sun.

00:19:04.852 --> 00:19:08.814 align:middle line:84%
The sun, our sun, does not
have a north and south pole,

00:19:08.814 --> 00:19:12.568 align:middle line:84%
like the Earth does, like Mars
and some of the other planets.

00:19:12.568 --> 00:19:15.988 align:middle line:84%
Our sun doesn't have a
single north and south pole.

00:19:15.988 --> 00:19:20.368 align:middle line:84%
What it has is many
north and south poles

00:19:20.368 --> 00:19:24.580 align:middle line:84%
that are specific to
each magnetic field,

00:19:24.580 --> 00:19:29.168 align:middle line:84%
or what we call magnetic storm
that is happening on the sun.

00:19:29.168 --> 00:19:33.297 align:middle line:84%
So when the sun goes
through a period of time

00:19:33.297 --> 00:19:36.926 align:middle line:84%
where the sunspot
cycle is high, it

00:19:36.926 --> 00:19:39.845 align:middle line:84%
means there are a lot of
magnetic storms on the sun,

00:19:39.845 --> 00:19:41.555 align:middle line:84%
so it's not
surprising that would

00:19:41.555 --> 00:19:44.683 align:middle line:84%
influence the magnetic
fields of the Earth.

00:19:44.683 --> 00:19:47.561 align:middle line:84%
This is where the
biology comes into it.

00:19:47.561 --> 00:19:51.857 align:middle line:84%
The strongest magnetic field
in your body, the strongest

00:19:51.857 --> 00:19:54.610 align:middle line:84%
biological magnetic field
is not in your brain,

00:19:54.610 --> 00:19:56.153 align:middle line:90%
it's in your heart.

00:19:56.153 --> 00:19:57.488 align:middle line:90%
Your brain has a magnetic field.

00:19:57.488 --> 00:19:59.323 align:middle line:84%
The heart is much,
much stronger.

00:19:59.323 --> 00:20:01.075 align:middle line:90%
So now we're seeing a link.

00:20:01.075 --> 00:20:03.452 align:middle line:84%
Magnetic fields of the sun,
magnetic fields of the Earth,

00:20:03.452 --> 00:20:05.287 align:middle line:90%
magnetic fields of the heart.

00:20:05.287 --> 00:20:07.790 align:middle line:84%
Now you can see why
we would be influenced

00:20:07.790 --> 00:20:10.167 align:middle line:90%
by these solar cycles.

00:20:10.167 --> 00:20:13.421 align:middle line:84%
So this relationship
is one of the reasons

00:20:13.421 --> 00:20:15.840 align:middle line:84%
that scientists are
interested in tracking

00:20:15.840 --> 00:20:18.050 align:middle line:84%
what it is that's happening
in the magnetic fields

00:20:18.050 --> 00:20:19.802 align:middle line:90%
of the Earth.

00:20:19.802 --> 00:20:22.263 align:middle line:84%
Well, this is
another place where

00:20:22.263 --> 00:20:25.683 align:middle line:84%
our conversation about the
false assumptions of science

00:20:25.683 --> 00:20:27.393 align:middle line:84%
is going to be really
important and it

00:20:27.393 --> 00:20:31.397 align:middle line:84%
comes into play with why what
I'm about to describe to you

00:20:31.397 --> 00:20:34.900 align:middle line:84%
was a mystery originally
to scientists.

00:20:34.900 --> 00:20:37.445 align:middle line:84%
It took a tragedy,
unfortunately,

00:20:37.445 --> 00:20:42.074 align:middle line:84%
for scientists to really wake up
to how deep this connection is

00:20:42.074 --> 00:20:44.577 align:middle line:84%
between us and the magnetic
fields of the Earth,

00:20:44.577 --> 00:20:48.247 align:middle line:84%
between our hearts and the
magnetic fields of the Earth.

00:20:48.247 --> 00:20:51.584 align:middle line:84%
The information that comes
back from these satellites,

00:20:51.584 --> 00:20:54.962 align:middle line:84%
it is charted every
day, two satellites,

00:20:54.962 --> 00:20:58.424 align:middle line:84%
called the geosynchronous
orbital satellites, or GOES,

00:20:58.424 --> 00:21:01.135 align:middle line:90%
G-O-E-S, for short.

00:21:01.135 --> 00:21:04.305 align:middle line:84%
We have GOES number one
and GOES number two.

00:21:04.305 --> 00:21:06.390 align:middle line:84%
What you're seeing
on your screen

00:21:06.390 --> 00:21:11.020 align:middle line:84%
is a chart that shows
these magnetic fields being

00:21:11.020 --> 00:21:14.773 align:middle line:84%
plotted as a result of what
the satellites have sent to us.

00:21:14.773 --> 00:21:17.776 align:middle line:84%
And each box represents
a 24-hour period of time.

00:21:17.776 --> 00:21:20.446 align:middle line:84%
So you can see, every 24 hours,
they ebb, they flow, they ebb

00:21:20.446 --> 00:21:21.238 align:middle line:90%
and they flow.

00:21:21.238 --> 00:21:22.781 align:middle line:90%
Scientists know this.

00:21:22.781 --> 00:21:24.450 align:middle line:10%
One of the satellite's
data is in red,

00:21:24.450 --> 00:21:27.036 align:middle line:10%
the other one is in blue.

00:21:27.036 --> 00:21:30.247 align:middle line:10%
One day, as scientists
were watching this data,

00:21:30.247 --> 00:21:31.832 align:middle line:10%
there was a huge
spike that happened.

00:21:31.832 --> 00:21:34.335 align:middle line:10%
And the scientists are saying,
we've never seen that before,

00:21:34.335 --> 00:21:35.127 align:middle line:10%
what on Earth?

00:21:35.127 --> 00:21:37.880 align:middle line:10%
And what on Earth is happening
to the magnetic fields

00:21:37.880 --> 00:21:39.965 align:middle line:10%
of the Earth to
create this spike?

00:21:39.965 --> 00:21:42.343 align:middle line:10%
So they took the data
and they overlaid it

00:21:42.343 --> 00:21:44.220 align:middle line:10%
onto a calendar of time.

00:21:44.220 --> 00:21:47.932 align:middle line:10%
So they could see what
date that spike occurred.

00:21:47.932 --> 00:21:49.475 align:middle line:10%
And it's probably
no surprise to you,

00:21:49.475 --> 00:21:51.727 align:middle line:10%
because I've referenced
this in the past.

00:21:51.727 --> 00:21:53.479 align:middle line:10%
It was a big surprise
to the scientists.

00:21:53.479 --> 00:21:57.816 align:middle line:10%
That spike happened at
9:00 AM Eastern Standard

00:21:57.816 --> 00:22:02.905 align:middle line:10%
Time, September 11,
2001, 15 minutes

00:22:02.905 --> 00:22:05.407 align:middle line:10%
after the first plane hit the
first tower of the World Trade

00:22:05.407 --> 00:22:07.243 align:middle line:10%
Center.

00:22:07.243 --> 00:22:09.870 align:middle line:84%
The reason this is important
is because scientists believe

00:22:09.870 --> 00:22:14.333 align:middle line:84%
it took about 15 minutes for
the images of the tragedy

00:22:14.333 --> 00:22:17.419 align:middle line:84%
to travel through the media,
through the satellites

00:22:17.419 --> 00:22:21.173 align:middle line:84%
and the televisions, all around
the world for people to see,

00:22:21.173 --> 00:22:23.842 align:middle line:84%
and that the magnetic
spike that we

00:22:23.842 --> 00:22:29.139 align:middle line:84%
were seeing from the satellites
measuring Earth's field

00:22:29.139 --> 00:22:33.978 align:middle line:84%
was actually the result of
hundreds of thousands, probably

00:22:33.978 --> 00:22:36.855 align:middle line:84%
millions or even
billions of people

00:22:36.855 --> 00:22:42.111 align:middle line:84%
watching the data in the same
moment in time simultaneously.

00:22:42.111 --> 00:22:44.780 align:middle line:84%
Hundreds of thousands,
millions or billions of people

00:22:44.780 --> 00:22:48.242 align:middle line:84%
are watching the tragedy
through the media,

00:22:48.242 --> 00:22:51.996 align:middle line:84%
and they are having a
heart-based response

00:22:51.996 --> 00:22:54.957 align:middle line:84%
to what they're seeing,
an emotional response.

00:22:54.957 --> 00:22:57.626 align:middle line:84%
Now a lot of different
responses, some were angry,

00:22:57.626 --> 00:22:59.878 align:middle line:84%
some were afraid,
some were saddened.

00:22:59.878 --> 00:23:03.882 align:middle line:84%
The key is they were all
heart-based experiences.

00:23:03.882 --> 00:23:07.052 align:middle line:84%
All of a sudden, from a
purely physics point of view,

00:23:07.052 --> 00:23:09.179 align:middle line:84%
we have hundreds,
possibly millions

00:23:09.179 --> 00:23:12.850 align:middle line:84%
of human magnetic
fields from the heart

00:23:12.850 --> 00:23:16.437 align:middle line:84%
that are now
collectively feeding

00:23:16.437 --> 00:23:20.566 align:middle line:84%
the greater magnetic field of
the Earth, spiking that field.

00:23:20.566 --> 00:23:22.109 align:middle line:84%
Now this is a surprise
to scientists,

00:23:22.109 --> 00:23:23.694 align:middle line:84%
because their
conditioning, as you

00:23:23.694 --> 00:23:27.364 align:middle line:84%
saw earlier in this episode,
or earlier in this series,

00:23:27.364 --> 00:23:30.117 align:middle line:84%
is that we are separate
from the Earth.

00:23:30.117 --> 00:23:31.910 align:middle line:84%
And if we're separate,
there's no way

00:23:31.910 --> 00:23:34.538 align:middle line:84%
that humans could influence the
magnetic field of the planet.

00:23:34.538 --> 00:23:36.582 align:middle line:84%
So scientists weren't
expecting this.

00:23:36.582 --> 00:23:39.627 align:middle line:84%
This was the wake up
call that said, my god,

00:23:39.627 --> 00:23:42.630 align:middle line:84%
look, not only are we
connected, but we're

00:23:42.630 --> 00:23:47.259 align:middle line:84%
so deeply connected that we can
influence the magnetic field

00:23:47.259 --> 00:23:49.345 align:middle line:90%
of an entire planet.

00:23:49.345 --> 00:23:51.013 align:middle line:90%
Here's why that's important.

00:23:51.013 --> 00:23:54.516 align:middle line:84%
If you remember what
happened on the Earth,

00:23:54.516 --> 00:23:57.478 align:middle line:84%
in major population centers
all over the world, at least

00:23:57.478 --> 00:24:00.689 align:middle line:84%
for the first few
days after 9/11,

00:24:00.689 --> 00:24:04.234 align:middle line:84%
there was more cooperation,
there was more harmony.

00:24:04.234 --> 00:24:08.155 align:middle line:84%
We were truly a family, at
least for a couple of days.

00:24:08.155 --> 00:24:11.367 align:middle line:84%
People looked at one another
on the streets of major cities.

00:24:11.367 --> 00:24:12.451 align:middle line:90%
They made eye contact.

00:24:12.451 --> 00:24:14.703 align:middle line:90%
They hugged one another.

00:24:14.703 --> 00:24:17.873 align:middle line:84%
We felt like families, one
of the most peaceful times

00:24:17.873 --> 00:24:19.458 align:middle line:84%
in recent times,
in modern times,

00:24:19.458 --> 00:24:20.626 align:middle line:90%
in the history of the world.

00:24:20.626 --> 00:24:22.294 align:middle line:90%
Why did that happen?

00:24:22.294 --> 00:24:26.590 align:middle line:84%
Scientists attribute
that harmony

00:24:26.590 --> 00:24:29.677 align:middle line:84%
to the spike in the magnetic
fields of the Earth.

00:24:29.677 --> 00:24:31.095 align:middle line:90%
And here's why.

00:24:31.095 --> 00:24:33.806 align:middle line:84%
When the magnetic
fields are strong,

00:24:33.806 --> 00:24:38.102 align:middle line:84%
people are less aggressive,
people are more cooperative,

00:24:38.102 --> 00:24:40.187 align:middle line:84%
they're more willing
to work together

00:24:40.187 --> 00:24:41.188 align:middle line:90%
to solve their problems.

00:24:41.188 --> 00:24:45.484 align:middle line:84%
When the magnetics are weak,
people become more aggressive,

00:24:45.484 --> 00:24:49.571 align:middle line:90%
conflict becomes more available.

00:24:49.571 --> 00:24:51.323 align:middle line:84%
Doesn't mean it has
to happen, but there's

00:24:51.323 --> 00:24:53.492 align:middle line:90%
more of a tendency toward that.

00:24:53.492 --> 00:24:57.079 align:middle line:84%
When those magnetic fields are
low, we are more aggressive.

00:24:57.079 --> 00:24:59.998 align:middle line:84%
So the elevation of
the magnetic fields

00:24:59.998 --> 00:25:05.003 align:middle line:84%
created a temporary aura
of peace upon the Earth.

00:25:05.003 --> 00:25:07.214 align:middle line:84%
And that was the
trigger to scientists.

00:25:07.214 --> 00:25:09.633 align:middle line:84%
They said, can we
duplicate the effect

00:25:09.633 --> 00:25:11.593 align:middle line:90%
without having the tragedy?

00:25:11.593 --> 00:25:15.097 align:middle line:84%
Can we create a strong
magnetic field on the earth

00:25:15.097 --> 00:25:18.851 align:middle line:84%
without having something
sad and horrible

00:25:18.851 --> 00:25:22.187 align:middle line:84%
to elicit this experience
in people's hearts?

00:25:22.187 --> 00:25:23.731 align:middle line:10%
Well, the answer is, yes.

00:25:23.731 --> 00:25:26.692 align:middle line:10%
And that's where we're going
with this whole exercise

00:25:26.692 --> 00:25:28.986 align:middle line:10%
that we're talking about here.

00:25:28.986 --> 00:25:31.155 align:middle line:84%
I mentioned earlier
the Institute

00:25:31.155 --> 00:25:33.782 align:middle line:84%
of HeartMath, the
pioneering research

00:25:33.782 --> 00:25:36.201 align:middle line:84%
institute in
northern California,

00:25:36.201 --> 00:25:38.996 align:middle line:84%
studying the human heart
in non-conventional ways

00:25:38.996 --> 00:25:40.873 align:middle line:84%
that typically aren't
even acknowledged

00:25:40.873 --> 00:25:43.667 align:middle line:84%
in many universities
and medical schools.

00:25:43.667 --> 00:25:46.336 align:middle line:84%
They're the ones that discovered
the magnetic field of the heart

00:25:46.336 --> 00:25:47.755 align:middle line:84%
is so much stronger
than the brain

00:25:47.755 --> 00:25:50.591 align:middle line:84%
and that the heart has
this intuitive ability

00:25:50.591 --> 00:25:53.927 align:middle line:84%
to learn and think and
sense and feel and remember,

00:25:53.927 --> 00:25:55.721 align:middle line:90%
separate from the brain itself.

00:25:55.721 --> 00:25:58.932 align:middle line:84%
So it's not surprising that
the Institute of HeartMath

00:25:58.932 --> 00:26:01.435 align:middle line:84%
would be the ones
to pioneer the study

00:26:01.435 --> 00:26:03.645 align:middle line:84%
that I'm about to
share with you.

00:26:03.645 --> 00:26:06.148 align:middle line:84%
And for transparency, I
want to be very, very clear

00:26:06.148 --> 00:26:07.900 align:middle line:90%
on my relationship to HeartMath.

00:26:07.900 --> 00:26:10.068 align:middle line:90%
I am not their employee.

00:26:10.068 --> 00:26:13.238 align:middle line:84%
I have been closely
affiliated with HeartMath

00:26:13.238 --> 00:26:15.991 align:middle line:84%
for almost 20 years now,
almost since their inception

00:26:15.991 --> 00:26:17.451 align:middle line:90%
on the West Coast.

00:26:17.451 --> 00:26:18.243 align:middle line:90%
We are friends.

00:26:18.243 --> 00:26:19.161 align:middle line:90%
We've toured together.

00:26:19.161 --> 00:26:20.412 align:middle line:90%
We share information together.

00:26:20.412 --> 00:26:24.041 align:middle line:84%
They've given me permission to
share their research with you

00:26:24.041 --> 00:26:25.626 align:middle line:90%
in this program.

00:26:25.626 --> 00:26:30.339 align:middle line:84%
And I am on the steering
committee for a project

00:26:30.339 --> 00:26:32.925 align:middle line:84%
that I'm going to share with
you right now, because I believe

00:26:32.925 --> 00:26:36.136 align:middle line:84%
in it and I think it
hold perhaps the greatest

00:26:36.136 --> 00:26:39.598 align:middle line:84%
hope for peace and harmony
in our world today.

00:26:39.598 --> 00:26:43.268 align:middle line:84%
It is called the Global
Coherence Initiative,

00:26:43.268 --> 00:26:45.646 align:middle line:90%
or shortened to GCI.

00:26:45.646 --> 00:26:47.272 align:middle line:90%
Personal coherence is good.

00:26:47.272 --> 00:26:49.483 align:middle line:90%
Global coherence is really good.

00:26:49.483 --> 00:26:51.902 align:middle line:84%
What the Global Coherence
Initiative is telling

00:26:51.902 --> 00:26:57.658 align:middle line:84%
us is that strong
collective emotion

00:26:57.658 --> 00:27:00.327 align:middle line:84%
has a measurable impact on the
magnetic fields of the Earth.

00:27:00.327 --> 00:27:02.579 align:middle line:84%
That's a fact, and
we know that now.

00:27:02.579 --> 00:27:07.960 align:middle line:84%
So what HeartMath opted to do
was two things, two phases.

00:27:07.960 --> 00:27:10.420 align:middle line:84%
First, to build a
project, and I'm

00:27:10.420 --> 00:27:12.673 align:middle line:84%
going to read the mission
statement word for word

00:27:12.673 --> 00:27:15.133 align:middle line:84%
to you for this project,
to build a project

00:27:15.133 --> 00:27:17.094 align:middle line:84%
to create that
coherence and to be

00:27:17.094 --> 00:27:19.513 align:middle line:84%
able to measure the coherence
in a scientific way,

00:27:19.513 --> 00:27:21.807 align:middle line:84%
so that we know when
we're effective.

00:27:21.807 --> 00:27:24.017 align:middle line:10%
Here's the mission
statement for this project.

00:27:24.017 --> 00:27:26.895 align:middle line:10%
The Global Coherence
Project is the first

00:27:26.895 --> 00:27:30.148 align:middle line:10%
of its kind
science-based initiative

00:27:30.148 --> 00:27:32.693 align:middle line:10%
that is designed for
only one purpose.

00:27:32.693 --> 00:27:36.864 align:middle line:10%
The purpose is "to
unite millions of people

00:27:36.864 --> 00:27:38.907 align:middle line:10%
from varied beliefs
and varied cultures,

00:27:38.907 --> 00:27:41.910 align:middle line:10%
from all over the world, to
shift global consciousness

00:27:41.910 --> 00:27:48.500 align:middle line:10%
from instability and chaos
to balance and cooperation."

00:27:48.500 --> 00:27:53.547 align:middle line:10%
This is the first of its kind,
science-based initiative that

00:27:53.547 --> 00:27:56.884 align:middle line:10%
is designed solely for the
purpose of what I've just

00:27:56.884 --> 00:27:57.676 align:middle line:10%
shared with you.

00:27:57.676 --> 00:28:04.433 align:middle line:84%
Its only reason for existing is
to create harmony and balance

00:28:04.433 --> 00:28:07.227 align:middle line:84%
in the conscious fields
that connect all things.

00:28:07.227 --> 00:28:11.773 align:middle line:84%
And that begins in the magnetic
fields that connect all things.

00:28:11.773 --> 00:28:14.192 align:middle line:84%
The thinking is this--
it's a very simple model--

00:28:14.192 --> 00:28:16.695 align:middle line:84%
but HeartMath's
thinking is that when

00:28:16.695 --> 00:28:21.742 align:middle line:84%
we can create personal coherence
in our own lives, in our homes,

00:28:21.742 --> 00:28:23.201 align:middle line:84%
in our families,
with our children,

00:28:23.201 --> 00:28:25.913 align:middle line:84%
in the workplace
and the classroom,

00:28:25.913 --> 00:28:28.624 align:middle line:84%
that we begin to build
social coherence,

00:28:28.624 --> 00:28:32.878 align:middle line:84%
because that harmony is
reflected in those around us.

00:28:32.878 --> 00:28:36.340 align:middle line:84%
And if we do this on
a large enough scale,

00:28:36.340 --> 00:28:38.759 align:middle line:84%
it becomes the
global coherence that

00:28:38.759 --> 00:28:40.719 align:middle line:84%
gives us the
environment to keep this

00:28:40.719 --> 00:28:42.095 align:middle line:90%
going in our personal lives.

00:28:42.095 --> 00:28:45.390 align:middle line:84%
It's much easier to live
this kind of coherence

00:28:45.390 --> 00:28:47.184 align:middle line:84%
when we are surrounded
by other people that

00:28:47.184 --> 00:28:49.227 align:middle line:90%
share the same belief.

00:28:49.227 --> 00:28:52.731 align:middle line:84%
So the Global Coherence
Initiative was born.

00:28:52.731 --> 00:28:54.232 align:middle line:90%
GCI.

00:28:54.232 --> 00:28:55.984 align:middle line:90%
It is two phases.

00:28:55.984 --> 00:28:59.988 align:middle line:84%
The first phase is the
scientific documentation,

00:28:59.988 --> 00:29:04.451 align:middle line:84%
the instrumentation that allows
scientists for the first time

00:29:04.451 --> 00:29:08.246 align:middle line:84%
to measure these
fields independently

00:29:08.246 --> 00:29:09.748 align:middle line:90%
of any other organization.

00:29:09.748 --> 00:29:12.417 align:middle line:84%
This is not linked to a weather
satellite or communications

00:29:12.417 --> 00:29:15.337 align:middle line:84%
satellite or a
military satellite.

00:29:15.337 --> 00:29:18.966 align:middle line:10%
We wanted to build
the sensors to be

00:29:18.966 --> 00:29:22.010 align:middle line:10%
able to tell us what the fields
of the Earth are really doing.

00:29:22.010 --> 00:29:23.720 align:middle line:10%
Satellites are expensive.

00:29:23.720 --> 00:29:27.391 align:middle line:10%
So HeartMath opted to
build ground-based sensors.

00:29:27.391 --> 00:29:29.559 align:middle line:10%
And what you're seeing
on your screen right now,

00:29:29.559 --> 00:29:31.520 align:middle line:10%
this is the image of one
of the first sensors,

00:29:31.520 --> 00:29:35.899 align:middle line:10%
as it was large, about four
feet tall, and a little awkward.

00:29:35.899 --> 00:29:37.359 align:middle line:90%
It worked very well.

00:29:37.359 --> 00:29:40.237 align:middle line:84%
But as happens so
often, the innovation

00:29:40.237 --> 00:29:43.573 align:middle line:84%
moved quickly to
much smaller sensors.

00:29:43.573 --> 00:29:46.743 align:middle line:84%
And now the sensors are
actually based in the ground.

00:29:46.743 --> 00:29:48.495 align:middle line:84%
And the image you're
seeing on your screen

00:29:48.495 --> 00:29:52.999 align:middle line:84%
is the ground-based image of
what that actually looks like.

00:29:52.999 --> 00:29:56.169 align:middle line:10%
The sensors are still
being built, the network,

00:29:56.169 --> 00:29:58.630 align:middle line:10%
but right now, there's one
in northern California,

00:29:58.630 --> 00:30:00.048 align:middle line:10%
one on the East
Coast in New York.

00:30:00.048 --> 00:30:03.260 align:middle line:10%
There's one in the UK,
one in Saudi Arabia,

00:30:03.260 --> 00:30:07.264 align:middle line:10%
and there is one right
now in New Zealand.

00:30:07.264 --> 00:30:09.016 align:middle line:10%
This is the network so far.

00:30:09.016 --> 00:30:12.894 align:middle line:10%
Additional sensors are proposed,
but with what we have so far,

00:30:12.894 --> 00:30:17.149 align:middle line:10%
we're able to bring back data
every day, just like you're

00:30:17.149 --> 00:30:18.233 align:middle line:10%
seeing on your screen.

00:30:18.233 --> 00:30:22.487 align:middle line:10%
And this is telling us when the
fields of the Earth are quiet

00:30:22.487 --> 00:30:23.488 align:middle line:10%
and when they're active.

00:30:23.488 --> 00:30:26.074 align:middle line:10%
This is telling us when
we are in coherence

00:30:26.074 --> 00:30:27.534 align:middle line:10%
and when we're not.

00:30:27.534 --> 00:30:30.412 align:middle line:84%
The beauty of this
entire project

00:30:30.412 --> 00:30:34.332 align:middle line:84%
is that we now have a
tool, using the best

00:30:34.332 --> 00:30:36.460 align:middle line:84%
science of the
modern world, based

00:30:36.460 --> 00:30:40.130 align:middle line:84%
on the wisdom of 5,000 years of
human experience, that hearkens

00:30:40.130 --> 00:30:43.925 align:middle line:84%
back to our most ancient and
cherished spiritual traditions,

00:30:43.925 --> 00:30:46.720 align:middle line:84%
that tells us if
we can find a way

00:30:46.720 --> 00:30:49.264 align:middle line:84%
to marry our heart and
our brain together,

00:30:49.264 --> 00:30:54.686 align:middle line:84%
in doing so we create the
field of peace and harmony

00:30:54.686 --> 00:30:57.981 align:middle line:84%
in our world that
actually encourages

00:30:57.981 --> 00:31:01.401 align:middle line:84%
the cooperation that it takes
to bring nations together

00:31:01.401 --> 00:31:03.278 align:middle line:90%
in our time of extremes.

00:31:03.278 --> 00:31:04.988 align:middle line:84%
I can't think of
anything more beautiful,

00:31:04.988 --> 00:31:08.033 align:middle line:90%
a more beautiful symmetry.

00:31:08.033 --> 00:31:09.743 align:middle line:84%
The knowledge of our
intimate connection

00:31:09.743 --> 00:31:12.079 align:middle line:84%
with the Earth that's come
from the Global Coherence

00:31:12.079 --> 00:31:15.624 align:middle line:84%
Initiative, it empowers us in a
way that's never been possible

00:31:15.624 --> 00:31:16.958 align:middle line:90%
in the modern world.

00:31:16.958 --> 00:31:21.004 align:middle line:84%
And for me, this is what gives
me a reason to be optimistic.

00:31:21.004 --> 00:31:24.925 align:middle line:84%
It gives me the realistic
hope that together, we'll

00:31:24.925 --> 00:31:27.010 align:middle line:84%
create the best possible
world and that we'll

00:31:27.010 --> 00:31:30.055 align:middle line:90%
see that world in our lifetime.

00:31:30.055 --> 00:31:33.517 align:middle line:84%

through this series.

00:32:21.565 --> 00:32:23.900 align:middle line:84%
It's our story.
It's about you and me.
