00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:12.375 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:12.375 --> 00:00:23.970 align:middle line:90%


00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:24.770 align:middle line:90%
>> Hello.

00:00:24.770 --> 00:00:25.920 align:middle line:90%
My name's Gregg Braden.

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:28.910 align:middle line:10%
And I'd like to welcome you to
this very special presentation

00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:30.710 align:middle line:10%
of "The Divine Matrix--

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:34.550 align:middle line:10%
Bridging Time, Space,
Miracles, and Belief."

00:00:34.550 --> 00:00:36.620 align:middle line:84%
In the last episode,
we discovered

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:40.520 align:middle line:84%
that we are biologically
wired to rewrite the reality

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:42.740 align:middle line:84%
code of the divine
matrix, and to do so

00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:45.560 align:middle line:90%
in seemingly superhuman ways.

00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:47.660 align:middle line:84%
Well in this episode,
I'll describe

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:51.200 align:middle line:84%
why our advanced knowledge of
the divine matrix and our role

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:54.770 align:middle line:84%
in it literally holds the
key not only to our healing,

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:57.810 align:middle line:84%
but to the fate and the
survival of our entire world.

00:00:57.810 --> 00:01:00.710 align:middle line:90%


00:01:00.710 --> 00:01:03.750 align:middle line:84%
There's a battle unfolding
on the world stage, that's

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:06.480 align:middle line:84%
playing out on a daily basis
in our everyday lives--

00:01:06.480 --> 00:01:08.750 align:middle line:90%
in your life and in my life.

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:10.770 align:middle line:84%
When we see this battle
in unexpected ways,

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:12.550 align:middle line:84%
it's a daily
struggle between what

00:01:12.550 --> 00:01:17.140 align:middle line:84%
we call good and evil, light and
dark, knowledge and ignorance.

00:01:17.140 --> 00:01:19.960 align:middle line:84%
Between being victims
and being empowered so

00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:22.370 align:middle line:90%
that we're no longer victims.

00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:23.860 align:middle line:84%
Well the battle
I'm talking about,

00:01:23.860 --> 00:01:27.240 align:middle line:84%
it's playing out in the
scientific community as well.

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:29.920 align:middle line:84%
And we see this
battle as the fight

00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:33.010 align:middle line:84%
to maintain what we call
the standard model when

00:01:33.010 --> 00:01:36.960 align:middle line:84%
it comes to the story of us,
of the universe, of our lives.

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:41.070 align:middle line:84%
And the story of our origin
as well as our potential.

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:44.590 align:middle line:84%
Now the current standard
model, it's based on a story

00:01:44.590 --> 00:01:46.840 align:middle line:84%
that you and I have been
steeped in from the time

00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:48.050 align:middle line:90%
that we were born.

00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:50.680 align:middle line:84%
It's the story of
Western civilization.

00:01:50.680 --> 00:01:54.430 align:middle line:84%
It is a story based upon
separation, competition,

00:01:54.430 --> 00:01:58.680 align:middle line:90%
conflict, struggle, scarcity.

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:02.430 align:middle line:84%
It's the sterile-sounding
story of a dead universe,

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:05.010 align:middle line:84%
of random mutations
that just happened

00:02:05.010 --> 00:02:08.400 align:middle line:84%
as a result of just the
right conditions converging

00:02:08.400 --> 00:02:11.280 align:middle line:84%
at just the right time
in just the right way,

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:15.360 align:middle line:84%
requiring a series of events
that are so lucky, that even

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:17.790 align:middle line:84%
scientists say it
takes an act of faith

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:20.710 align:middle line:84%
to believe the story
that we're being told.

00:02:20.710 --> 00:02:23.180 align:middle line:84%
Well there's a new standard
model that's emerging.

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:25.410 align:middle line:84%
It has to, because
the evidence--

00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:28.560 align:middle line:84%
the science-based evidence
no longer supports

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:31.290 align:middle line:84%
the scientific story
of the existing model.

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:34.810 align:middle line:84%
And the new standard model
is a very different story.

00:02:34.810 --> 00:02:39.460 align:middle line:84%
It's the story of a universe
that is alive, it's vibrant.

00:02:39.460 --> 00:02:42.930 align:middle line:84%
It's a story of a universe
where life is the rule rather

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:45.180 align:middle line:90%
than the rare exception.

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:48.990 align:middle line:84%
It's a story that creates a
model based upon cooperation,

00:02:48.990 --> 00:02:51.990 align:middle line:84%
not competition; upon
abundance, not scarcity;

00:02:51.990 --> 00:02:54.420 align:middle line:84%
upon mutual aid and
self-empowerment

00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:56.827 align:middle line:90%
through self-regulation.

00:02:56.827 --> 00:02:58.410 align:middle line:84%
And I want to stop
right here and just

00:02:58.410 --> 00:03:01.410 align:middle line:84%
be very, very clear, that is
what this series is all about.

00:03:01.410 --> 00:03:05.010 align:middle line:84%
You are learning about
your relationship

00:03:05.010 --> 00:03:06.060 align:middle line:90%
to the divine matrix.

00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:08.130 align:middle line:84%
You're learning about
your relationship

00:03:08.130 --> 00:03:10.980 align:middle line:84%
to the field that not
only connects all things,

00:03:10.980 --> 00:03:13.500 align:middle line:84%
it's the field that
makes you who you are.

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:16.710 align:middle line:90%
You are emerging constantly--

00:03:16.710 --> 00:03:19.860 align:middle line:84%
quanta is reemerging
and reemerging

00:03:19.860 --> 00:03:23.190 align:middle line:84%
and reemerging as the atoms
of your body from this field.

00:03:23.190 --> 00:03:26.130 align:middle line:84%
This is such a powerful
concept, that we're not

00:03:26.130 --> 00:03:28.440 align:middle line:84%
separate from the
field-- it is within us,

00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:30.750 align:middle line:90%
it is emerging as us.

00:03:30.750 --> 00:03:33.690 align:middle line:84%
And because we are part of
rather than separate from,

00:03:33.690 --> 00:03:37.020 align:middle line:84%
we are given the
ability to self-regulate

00:03:37.020 --> 00:03:40.860 align:middle line:84%
how we relate to this
field, and we've just

00:03:40.860 --> 00:03:44.940 align:middle line:84%
seen that we're wired to do
this-- our biology is actually

00:03:44.940 --> 00:03:49.110 align:middle line:84%
designed perfectly
for specifically

00:03:49.110 --> 00:03:52.220 align:middle line:84%
and exactly this kind
of self-regulation.

00:03:52.220 --> 00:03:54.780 align:middle line:84%
So the evidence that
supports these discoveries,

00:03:54.780 --> 00:03:57.770 align:middle line:84%
they're telling us
a new human story.

00:03:57.770 --> 00:04:00.030 align:middle line:84%
Now I have to tell you,
it is a beautiful story,

00:04:00.030 --> 00:04:01.930 align:middle line:90%
it is a powerful story.

00:04:01.930 --> 00:04:05.280 align:middle line:84%
It's a story of hope, the
story of possibility based

00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:07.630 align:middle line:84%
in rock solid evidence
of the new science

00:04:07.630 --> 00:04:09.340 align:middle line:90%
and the new discoveries.

00:04:09.340 --> 00:04:11.580 align:middle line:84%
And you know, I am
still mystified.

00:04:11.580 --> 00:04:14.610 align:middle line:84%
You would think
that people would

00:04:14.610 --> 00:04:17.820 align:middle line:84%
be so happy to hear
the new discoveries

00:04:17.820 --> 00:04:21.269 align:middle line:84%
and then to embrace the
potential that they offer.

00:04:21.269 --> 00:04:24.762 align:middle line:84%
The reality is, unfortunately,
we are simply not seeing

00:04:24.762 --> 00:04:26.970 align:middle line:84%
these discoveries-- as I
mentioned before, you're not

00:04:26.970 --> 00:04:28.350 align:middle line:90%
seeing them in the mainstream.

00:04:28.350 --> 00:04:31.320 align:middle line:84%
Mainstream
classrooms, textbooks,

00:04:31.320 --> 00:04:34.500 align:middle line:84%
mainstream documentaries,
cable television.

00:04:34.500 --> 00:04:36.240 align:middle line:84%
And it's for this
reason that I am

00:04:36.240 --> 00:04:39.360 align:middle line:84%
so passionate about this
program specifically

00:04:39.360 --> 00:04:41.220 align:middle line:90%
and "Missing Links" in general.

00:04:41.220 --> 00:04:43.020 align:middle line:84%
Because it gives
me the opportunity

00:04:43.020 --> 00:04:44.430 align:middle line:84%
to share with you
what you're not

00:04:44.430 --> 00:04:46.440 align:middle line:90%
seeing from these other venues.

00:04:46.440 --> 00:04:50.660 align:middle line:84%
We need the new human story
and we need it right now.

00:04:50.660 --> 00:04:53.960 align:middle line:84%
And we need it because of
one very simple reason--

00:04:53.960 --> 00:04:56.310 align:middle line:84%
the better we know
ourselves, the less

00:04:56.310 --> 00:04:59.110 align:middle line:90%
we fear change in the world.

00:04:59.110 --> 00:05:02.760 align:middle line:84%
If you think about it, we
are self-referencing beings.

00:05:02.760 --> 00:05:05.850 align:middle line:84%
And what that means is that
our sense of well-being

00:05:05.850 --> 00:05:08.430 align:middle line:84%
typically depends
upon how we feel

00:05:08.430 --> 00:05:11.370 align:middle line:84%
about what's happening in our
external world and the world

00:05:11.370 --> 00:05:12.900 align:middle line:90%
out there.

00:05:12.900 --> 00:05:15.787 align:middle line:84%
Well, you know and I know
our world is changing,

00:05:15.787 --> 00:05:17.370 align:middle line:84%
and it's changing
ways that we haven't

00:05:17.370 --> 00:05:20.370 align:middle line:84%
seen in 5,000 years of
recorded human history.

00:05:20.370 --> 00:05:22.410 align:middle line:84%
And the changes
can be frightening

00:05:22.410 --> 00:05:26.400 align:middle line:84%
unless we've learned to
find our sense of well-being

00:05:26.400 --> 00:05:30.270 align:middle line:84%
from within rather than
relying upon the stability

00:05:30.270 --> 00:05:32.790 align:middle line:84%
of the big world out there--
the external world to help

00:05:32.790 --> 00:05:34.960 align:middle line:90%
us feel good about ourselves.

00:05:34.960 --> 00:05:36.840 align:middle line:84%
So the better we know
ourselves, the less

00:05:36.840 --> 00:05:38.930 align:middle line:90%
we fear change in the world.

00:05:38.930 --> 00:05:39.930 align:middle line:90%
But it goes beyond that.

00:05:39.930 --> 00:05:44.010 align:middle line:84%
The better we know ourselves,
the less we fear one another.

00:05:44.010 --> 00:05:46.050 align:middle line:84%
The less we fear
one another-- and we

00:05:46.050 --> 00:05:51.090 align:middle line:84%
are being forced together as a
global community in ways that

00:05:51.090 --> 00:05:54.600 align:middle line:84%
have not happened in our
lifetimes-- in many ways,

00:05:54.600 --> 00:05:56.100 align:middle line:84%
in the instances,
it hasn't happened

00:05:56.100 --> 00:05:58.140 align:middle line:90%
in recorded human history.

00:05:58.140 --> 00:06:00.330 align:middle line:10%
I want you to think about
what I'm saying here.

00:06:00.330 --> 00:06:03.000 align:middle line:84%
We are living in a
globalized world.

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:06.180 align:middle line:84%
We're globalizing through
technology, obviously,

00:06:06.180 --> 00:06:07.260 align:middle line:90%
through communications.

00:06:07.260 --> 00:06:10.050 align:middle line:84%
We live in a
globalized economy, we

00:06:10.050 --> 00:06:13.170 align:middle line:84%
live in a world of globalized
defense, a world where

00:06:13.170 --> 00:06:15.870 align:middle line:84%
we are sharing resources
on a global level in ways

00:06:15.870 --> 00:06:17.980 align:middle line:84%
that we've never
done in the past.

00:06:17.980 --> 00:06:21.060 align:middle line:84%
So what's happening
is that the borders--

00:06:21.060 --> 00:06:23.940 align:middle line:84%
not the borders necessarily
inbetween countries,

00:06:23.940 --> 00:06:27.390 align:middle line:84%
but the divisions that have
separated us in the past

00:06:27.390 --> 00:06:29.740 align:middle line:90%
are now no longer in place.

00:06:29.740 --> 00:06:34.320 align:middle line:84%
And as people are pushed
together as cultures,

00:06:34.320 --> 00:06:37.890 align:middle line:84%
as people are pushed
together as religions

00:06:37.890 --> 00:06:40.260 align:middle line:84%
through the way that we think
and the way we treat one

00:06:40.260 --> 00:06:42.218 align:middle line:84%
another and the way we
think of men and the way

00:06:42.218 --> 00:06:44.070 align:middle line:84%
we think of women and
different cultures.

00:06:44.070 --> 00:06:49.843 align:middle line:84%
These differences are showing
up as the world is globalized,

00:06:49.843 --> 00:06:52.260 align:middle line:84%
and being pushed together,
we're trying to think and solve

00:06:52.260 --> 00:06:55.500 align:middle line:84%
the problems through
the story of our past

00:06:55.500 --> 00:06:57.390 align:middle line:84%
that's based on the
false assumptions

00:06:57.390 --> 00:07:00.350 align:middle line:84%
of an obsolete science, and
it's not working for us,

00:07:00.350 --> 00:07:04.490 align:middle line:84%
and that is why what I'm
saying to you is so powerful.

00:07:04.490 --> 00:07:06.450 align:middle line:84%
Because what I'm
sharing with you now,

00:07:06.450 --> 00:07:08.940 align:middle line:84%
this takes everything--
all of the science, all

00:07:08.940 --> 00:07:11.490 align:middle line:84%
of the mysteries,
all of the lost texts

00:07:11.490 --> 00:07:13.930 align:middle line:84%
and the ancient wisdom and the
internal technology and all

00:07:13.930 --> 00:07:16.360 align:middle line:90%
that, we're coming full circle.

00:07:16.360 --> 00:07:18.210 align:middle line:84%
We're coming full
circle and we're

00:07:18.210 --> 00:07:23.190 align:middle line:84%
looking at how these
new discoveries have

00:07:23.190 --> 00:07:26.990 align:middle line:84%
a direct bearing upon what's
happening in your world,

00:07:26.990 --> 00:07:29.670 align:middle line:84%
in my world; your life
and my life today.

00:07:29.670 --> 00:07:31.170 align:middle line:84%
And that's why this
is so important.

00:07:31.170 --> 00:07:34.085 align:middle line:84%
And perhaps most
importantly, not only is it

00:07:34.085 --> 00:07:36.210 align:middle line:84%
true that the better we
know ourselves, the less we

00:07:36.210 --> 00:07:38.340 align:middle line:84%
fear change, the
less we fear one

00:07:38.340 --> 00:07:42.360 align:middle line:84%
another, the better we
know ourselves, the less we

00:07:42.360 --> 00:07:44.080 align:middle line:90%
fear ourselves.

00:07:44.080 --> 00:07:45.418 align:middle line:90%
I'm going to be very personal.

00:07:45.418 --> 00:07:46.710 align:middle line:90%
I'm going to look right at you.

00:07:46.710 --> 00:07:50.490 align:middle line:84%
The better you know yourself,
the less you fear yourself.

00:07:50.490 --> 00:07:53.500 align:middle line:84%
The less you fear
your own power--

00:07:53.500 --> 00:07:58.170 align:middle line:84%
and I want to tell you, you
are one very powerful being.

00:07:58.170 --> 00:08:00.330 align:middle line:84%
And I hope that
is obvious to you.

00:08:00.330 --> 00:08:02.550 align:middle line:84%
Through everything that
we've gone through,

00:08:02.550 --> 00:08:06.450 align:middle line:84%
for thousands of years, the
texts and the traditions

00:08:06.450 --> 00:08:10.470 align:middle line:84%
have worked to do just
the opposite-- to keep you

00:08:10.470 --> 00:08:15.090 align:middle line:84%
from accessing the depths,
the extent, the potential that

00:08:15.090 --> 00:08:18.100 align:middle line:84%
lives within you as a human,
living within this field,

00:08:18.100 --> 00:08:20.500 align:middle line:90%
living within the divine matrix.

00:08:20.500 --> 00:08:22.320 align:middle line:84%
And in a large
extent, it's worked,

00:08:22.320 --> 00:08:24.540 align:middle line:84%
and I'm not saying it's
right, wrong, good, or bad,

00:08:24.540 --> 00:08:26.340 align:middle line:84%
because whatever has
happened in the past,

00:08:26.340 --> 00:08:27.923 align:middle line:84%
it worked well enough
to get us here--

00:08:27.923 --> 00:08:29.550 align:middle line:90%
we're here now, all right?

00:08:29.550 --> 00:08:33.150 align:middle line:84%
And now we're living not only
the convergence of societies

00:08:33.150 --> 00:08:34.679 align:middle line:90%
and peoples and cultures--

00:08:34.679 --> 00:08:38.370 align:middle line:84%
think about this-- we're living
the convergence of wisdom.

00:08:38.370 --> 00:08:41.190 align:middle line:84%
We're living the convergence
of two great ways of knowing--

00:08:41.190 --> 00:08:44.850 align:middle line:84%
5,000 years-- of the
wisdom of our ancestors'

00:08:44.850 --> 00:08:47.600 align:middle line:84%
spiritual traditions,
not science.

00:08:47.600 --> 00:08:49.350 align:middle line:84%
And the best science
of the modern world's

00:08:49.350 --> 00:08:51.180 align:middle line:90%
only about 300 years old.

00:08:51.180 --> 00:08:54.210 align:middle line:84%
Those two ways of knowing
are come together right now

00:08:54.210 --> 00:08:56.320 align:middle line:84%
precisely at the
time we need it,

00:08:56.320 --> 00:09:00.930 align:middle line:84%
when we are perched right on the
edge of war in our world today.

00:09:00.930 --> 00:09:04.650 align:middle line:84%
You feel the push toward war
because many people believe

00:09:04.650 --> 00:09:06.720 align:middle line:84%
that that is the
answer to the problems

00:09:06.720 --> 00:09:09.500 align:middle line:84%
because that has been
the answer in the past.

00:09:09.500 --> 00:09:11.910 align:middle line:84%
But we also see war's
no longer working.

00:09:11.910 --> 00:09:13.952 align:middle line:84%
In the old way of thinking,
when there was a war,

00:09:13.952 --> 00:09:15.618 align:middle line:84%
there was a winner
and a loser and there

00:09:15.618 --> 00:09:16.870 align:middle line:90%
was something to be gained.

00:09:16.870 --> 00:09:18.780 align:middle line:84%
And we all know
now that if there

00:09:18.780 --> 00:09:21.390 align:middle line:84%
is a war, whatever wars we're
looking at, nobody wins,

00:09:21.390 --> 00:09:22.650 align:middle line:90%
everybody loses.

00:09:22.650 --> 00:09:24.210 align:middle line:90%
And I think that's obvious.

00:09:24.210 --> 00:09:25.950 align:middle line:84%
And the powers
that be know that.

00:09:25.950 --> 00:09:28.290 align:middle line:84%
And so that's why there's
this window of opportunity,

00:09:28.290 --> 00:09:31.352 align:middle line:84%
this opening for new
wisdom-- new ways of living,

00:09:31.352 --> 00:09:33.060 align:middle line:84%
new ways of thinking,
new understandings,

00:09:33.060 --> 00:09:34.830 align:middle line:84%
and what you and I
are doing right now,

00:09:34.830 --> 00:09:37.770 align:middle line:84%
this is at the foundation--
this is the key for everything

00:09:37.770 --> 00:09:41.090 align:middle line:84%
I'm saying here, and that is
what "Missing Links" is all

00:09:41.090 --> 00:09:41.890 align:middle line:90%
about.

00:09:41.890 --> 00:09:45.550 align:middle line:84%
The less we fear our own power,
the less we fear our own power,

00:09:45.550 --> 00:09:48.630 align:middle line:84%
the more we can incorporate
these our lives.

00:09:48.630 --> 00:09:50.640 align:middle line:84%
So through the
episodes that I've

00:09:50.640 --> 00:09:53.820 align:middle line:84%
developed throughout this
series, you and I together,

00:09:53.820 --> 00:09:56.870 align:middle line:84%
we built a new understanding
as well as the vocabulary

00:09:56.870 --> 00:09:58.130 align:middle line:90%
as I've said before.

00:09:58.130 --> 00:10:02.130 align:middle line:84%
So that we can explore what
this new way of thinking

00:10:02.130 --> 00:10:05.820 align:middle line:84%
is all about when it comes to
us and our world and our bodies.

00:10:05.820 --> 00:10:09.570 align:middle line:84%
In season number 1, I
described this convergence

00:10:09.570 --> 00:10:11.400 align:middle line:84%
of the natural cycles
that's creating

00:10:11.400 --> 00:10:13.890 align:middle line:90%
the chaos of a changing world.

00:10:13.890 --> 00:10:16.440 align:middle line:10%
Where'd those cycles come
from, how long they last

00:10:16.440 --> 00:10:18.210 align:middle line:10%
and what they mean?

00:10:18.210 --> 00:10:21.130 align:middle line:10%
Season number 2, we
went even further,

00:10:21.130 --> 00:10:23.910 align:middle line:10%
but rather than the big
cycles, we went within.

00:10:23.910 --> 00:10:26.520 align:middle line:84%
We explored the
scientific evidence

00:10:26.520 --> 00:10:29.790 align:middle line:84%
suggesting the very real
possibility that you and I are

00:10:29.790 --> 00:10:31.710 align:middle line:90%
living in a simulation.

00:10:31.710 --> 00:10:34.770 align:middle line:84%
That we are living in
a simulated environment

00:10:34.770 --> 00:10:37.080 align:middle line:90%
in a virtual reality.

00:10:37.080 --> 00:10:40.870 align:middle line:84%
Season 3 is where we are right
now, through the divine matrix.

00:10:40.870 --> 00:10:43.920 align:middle line:84%
Now we've gone deeper
into the field of energy

00:10:43.920 --> 00:10:46.700 align:middle line:84%
that allows our
simulated reality

00:10:46.700 --> 00:10:49.230 align:middle line:84%
to work the way it works
and what it appears

00:10:49.230 --> 00:10:54.450 align:middle line:84%
to be based upon so that we can
access the codes of this matrix

00:10:54.450 --> 00:10:57.490 align:middle line:84%
through our greatest
levels of mastery.

00:10:57.490 --> 00:11:00.520 align:middle line:84%
Now I want you to know that
what we're doing here, again,

00:11:00.520 --> 00:11:03.180 align:middle line:84%
it's more than just
an interesting topic,

00:11:03.180 --> 00:11:05.850 align:middle line:84%
it's more than just
a philosophical way

00:11:05.850 --> 00:11:07.770 align:middle line:90%
of thinking about the world.

00:11:07.770 --> 00:11:11.430 align:middle line:84%
What we're doing right now has
a direct link to what you're

00:11:11.430 --> 00:11:12.780 align:middle line:90%
seeing in the world today.

00:11:12.780 --> 00:11:14.290 align:middle line:90%
Our story matters.

00:11:14.290 --> 00:11:16.120 align:middle line:90%
Your story matters.

00:11:16.120 --> 00:11:17.460 align:middle line:90%
And here's the reason--

00:11:17.460 --> 00:11:20.190 align:middle line:84%
because we live our lives
based upon our story.

00:11:20.190 --> 00:11:22.200 align:middle line:90%
We solve our problems.

00:11:22.200 --> 00:11:24.870 align:middle line:10%
We choose our
relationships based

00:11:24.870 --> 00:11:27.430 align:middle line:10%
upon the story we tell
ourselves about ourself.

00:11:27.430 --> 00:11:30.090 align:middle line:84%
Now let's stop here and just
invite you to think about this.

00:11:30.090 --> 00:11:33.383 align:middle line:84%
The people that you
invite into your life

00:11:33.383 --> 00:11:34.800 align:middle line:84%
are based upon the
way you've been

00:11:34.800 --> 00:11:37.530 align:middle line:90%
taught to think about yourself.

00:11:37.530 --> 00:11:39.602 align:middle line:84%
The relationships
that you built,

00:11:39.602 --> 00:11:41.310 align:middle line:84%
the people that you
invite in your home--

00:11:41.310 --> 00:11:44.460 align:middle line:84%
and let's be real, the people
you invite into your bed

00:11:44.460 --> 00:11:46.290 align:middle line:84%
are based on the
way you have been

00:11:46.290 --> 00:11:48.280 align:middle line:90%
taught to think about yourself.

00:11:48.280 --> 00:11:50.970 align:middle line:84%
Your self-esteem,
your self-worth,

00:11:50.970 --> 00:11:54.210 align:middle line:84%
all of these influence
the way that you think

00:11:54.210 --> 00:11:55.980 align:middle line:84%
and the way you
solve your problems,

00:11:55.980 --> 00:11:59.358 align:middle line:84%
even the way you heal
your body in the world.

00:11:59.358 --> 00:12:00.900 align:middle line:84%
Have you been taught
that you're part

00:12:00.900 --> 00:12:02.893 align:middle line:84%
of what's happening
in your body or you've

00:12:02.893 --> 00:12:05.310 align:middle line:84%
been taught that your body
just kind of does its own thing

00:12:05.310 --> 00:12:07.310 align:middle line:84%
and when something happens
you don't understand,

00:12:07.310 --> 00:12:08.370 align:middle line:90%
you need some help?

00:12:08.370 --> 00:12:09.810 align:middle line:84%
I'm not saying one
way of thinking

00:12:09.810 --> 00:12:12.450 align:middle line:84%
is right, wrong, good, or
bad, I'm not judging it.

00:12:12.450 --> 00:12:14.490 align:middle line:90%
I'm drawing a contrast here.

00:12:14.490 --> 00:12:17.970 align:middle line:84%
We are emerging from a world
and the way of thinking

00:12:17.970 --> 00:12:20.100 align:middle line:90%
that served us in the past.

00:12:20.100 --> 00:12:22.170 align:middle line:84%
And if the world
were not changing,

00:12:22.170 --> 00:12:24.600 align:middle line:84%
maybe it would
continue to serve us.

00:12:24.600 --> 00:12:26.400 align:middle line:84%
But you and I know,
the world is changing--

00:12:26.400 --> 00:12:27.900 align:middle line:90%
we just talked about that.

00:12:27.900 --> 00:12:31.230 align:middle line:84%
So what that means is, we've
got to think differently, we've

00:12:31.230 --> 00:12:34.930 align:middle line:84%
got to live differently, perhaps
more so now than we ever have.

00:12:34.930 --> 00:12:39.930 align:middle line:84%
So for 150 years, science
has taught us this story.

00:12:39.930 --> 00:12:42.840 align:middle line:84%
It's this story of separation,
competition, conflict,

00:12:42.840 --> 00:12:45.360 align:middle line:84%
struggle, scarcely,
and the like.

00:12:45.360 --> 00:12:47.140 align:middle line:90%
It goes even deeper than that.

00:12:47.140 --> 00:12:51.090 align:middle line:84%
It's the story when it comes
to us of random mutations.

00:12:51.090 --> 00:12:53.550 align:middle line:84%
Random mutations in
DNA that just happened

00:12:53.550 --> 00:12:56.580 align:middle line:90%
to form with no special--

00:12:56.580 --> 00:12:59.280 align:middle line:90%
no specialness around this, OK?

00:12:59.280 --> 00:13:02.420 align:middle line:84%
Random mutations
and insignificance.

00:13:02.420 --> 00:13:06.450 align:middle line:84%
Now astronomer Carl Sagan, he
echoed this viewpoint in a way

00:13:06.450 --> 00:13:08.820 align:middle line:84%
that I couldn't have
done better myself.

00:13:08.820 --> 00:13:12.340 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to share with you a
direct quote from Carl Sagan,

00:13:12.340 --> 00:13:13.980 align:middle line:84%
and you say it's an
interesting quote,

00:13:13.980 --> 00:13:16.710 align:middle line:84%
but look at how
it reinforces what

00:13:16.710 --> 00:13:17.970 align:middle line:90%
it is that I'm saying to you.

00:13:17.970 --> 00:13:19.720 align:middle line:84%
And then I'm going to
take it even deeper.

00:13:19.720 --> 00:13:22.260 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to share with
you what is being taught

00:13:22.260 --> 00:13:25.590 align:middle line:84%
in the university classrooms
to our young people

00:13:25.590 --> 00:13:28.800 align:middle line:84%
and how they are being taught
about the insignificance

00:13:28.800 --> 00:13:31.750 align:middle line:90%
of our lives and life itself.

00:13:31.750 --> 00:13:33.870 align:middle line:84%
So let me to share
with you Carl Sagan.

00:13:33.870 --> 00:13:36.390 align:middle line:84%
He said, quote, "We
find that we live

00:13:36.390 --> 00:13:39.780 align:middle line:84%
on an insignificant planet--"
there it is right there--

00:13:39.780 --> 00:13:44.070 align:middle line:84%
"of a humdrum star, lost
in a galaxy, tucked away

00:13:44.070 --> 00:13:47.070 align:middle line:84%
in some forgotten corner of
a universe in which there

00:13:47.070 --> 00:13:51.600 align:middle line:84%
are far more galaxies than
there are people," end of quote.

00:13:51.600 --> 00:13:53.280 align:middle line:84%
Now look at this
way of thinking.

00:13:53.280 --> 00:13:56.880 align:middle line:84%
What he's saying
is that we occupy

00:13:56.880 --> 00:14:00.280 align:middle line:84%
such an insignificant
place in creation.

00:14:00.280 --> 00:14:02.730 align:middle line:84%
Remember in earlier episodes,
John Wheeler, Princeton

00:14:02.730 --> 00:14:05.660 align:middle line:84%
University physicist, friend and
colleague of Albert Einstein,

00:14:05.660 --> 00:14:07.300 align:middle line:90%
he said just the opposite.

00:14:07.300 --> 00:14:10.480 align:middle line:84%
He said that "We are creating
the universe as we go."

00:14:10.480 --> 00:14:13.350 align:middle line:84%
These are very different
ways of thinking.

00:14:13.350 --> 00:14:17.762 align:middle line:84%
But Sagan is not alone in his
sense of our insignificance.

00:14:17.762 --> 00:14:19.220 align:middle line:84%
So I'd like to
share another quote,

00:14:19.220 --> 00:14:22.160 align:middle line:84%
and this is the one I
referenced just a moment ago.

00:14:22.160 --> 00:14:24.930 align:middle line:84%
It's coming directly from
a very popular chemistry

00:14:24.930 --> 00:14:28.380 align:middle line:84%
book that's used in American
colleges and universities

00:14:28.380 --> 00:14:29.660 align:middle line:90%
today.

00:14:29.660 --> 00:14:33.540 align:middle line:84%
And the reason I'm sharing this
is because this quote tells

00:14:33.540 --> 00:14:36.830 align:middle line:90%
our young people what life is.

00:14:36.830 --> 00:14:39.300 align:middle line:84%
And I'm going to
invite you to listen

00:14:39.300 --> 00:14:44.160 align:middle line:84%
to how sterile and lifeless
this definition of life

00:14:44.160 --> 00:14:45.040 align:middle line:90%
actually sounds.

00:14:45.040 --> 00:14:46.470 align:middle line:90%
Here's the definition.

00:14:46.470 --> 00:14:48.990 align:middle line:84%
The text says that
"Life is," quote,

00:14:48.990 --> 00:14:52.410 align:middle line:84%
"a behavior pattern that
chemical systems exhibit

00:14:52.410 --> 00:14:55.200 align:middle line:84%
when they reach a certain level
of complexity," end the quote.

00:14:55.200 --> 00:14:56.430 align:middle line:90%
I'm going to say that again--

00:14:56.430 --> 00:14:59.340 align:middle line:84%
"Life is a behavior pattern
that chemical systems

00:14:59.340 --> 00:15:02.520 align:middle line:84%
exhibit when they reach a
certain level of complexity."

00:15:02.520 --> 00:15:03.810 align:middle line:90%
Wow.

00:15:03.810 --> 00:15:06.820 align:middle line:84%
Where is the specialness
of life in this definition?

00:15:06.820 --> 00:15:07.620 align:middle line:90%
All right?

00:15:07.620 --> 00:15:09.090 align:middle line:90%
And that's the problem.

00:15:09.090 --> 00:15:11.640 align:middle line:84%
We're teaching an entire
generation of young people

00:15:11.640 --> 00:15:14.430 align:middle line:90%
that life is insignificant.

00:15:14.430 --> 00:15:16.260 align:middle line:84%
And if you think that
that's not happening,

00:15:16.260 --> 00:15:18.240 align:middle line:84%
look at the video
games that young people

00:15:18.240 --> 00:15:21.300 align:middle line:84%
are playing where life is
snuffed out in a heartbeat.

00:15:21.300 --> 00:15:24.120 align:middle line:84%
Look at the ease with
which life is taken.

00:15:24.120 --> 00:15:25.890 align:middle line:84%
Day in and day out
in the major cities

00:15:25.890 --> 00:15:29.220 align:middle line:84%
not only of America, not only of
the West, throughout the world.

00:15:29.220 --> 00:15:31.320 align:middle line:84%
Look at the ease with
which we are willing to go

00:15:31.320 --> 00:15:34.380 align:middle line:90%
into war to solve our problems.

00:15:34.380 --> 00:15:36.700 align:middle line:84%
As different as those
things are from one another,

00:15:36.700 --> 00:15:41.190 align:middle line:84%
they all have a common
denominator, and each of them,

00:15:41.190 --> 00:15:45.197 align:middle line:84%
in each instance, the
significance of life is lost.

00:15:45.197 --> 00:15:46.530 align:middle line:90%
I'm going to say it another way.

00:15:46.530 --> 00:15:48.870 align:middle line:84%
The only way those
things can happen

00:15:48.870 --> 00:15:52.680 align:middle line:84%
is because life has lost its
specialness, its significance.

00:15:52.680 --> 00:15:55.220 align:middle line:84%
It's this thinking that
is leading us, as I said,

00:15:55.220 --> 00:15:57.330 align:middle line:84%
to some of the greatest
acts of brutality

00:15:57.330 --> 00:15:59.435 align:middle line:84%
and hate that we see
in the world today,

00:15:59.435 --> 00:16:01.830 align:middle line:84%
and I don't like to
talk about these things.

00:16:01.830 --> 00:16:05.492 align:middle line:10%
I wrote a book recently in
2017, "Human by Design,"

00:16:05.492 --> 00:16:07.200 align:middle line:10%
and what I'm going to
share with you now,

00:16:07.200 --> 00:16:08.950 align:middle line:10%
it was the most difficult
part of the book

00:16:08.950 --> 00:16:12.870 align:middle line:10%
for me to research and to write,
and I left a lot of things

00:16:12.870 --> 00:16:14.880 align:middle line:10%
out because I didn't
want to inundate

00:16:14.880 --> 00:16:18.090 align:middle line:10%
my readers with the horrors and
the brutality, but it's real,

00:16:18.090 --> 00:16:19.530 align:middle line:10%
it's out there.

00:16:19.530 --> 00:16:21.600 align:middle line:90%
Hate is on the rise.

00:16:21.600 --> 00:16:23.460 align:middle line:84%
Hate based upon the
color of our skin,

00:16:23.460 --> 00:16:27.860 align:middle line:84%
hate based upon our religion,
upon our sexual orientation.

00:16:27.860 --> 00:16:31.240 align:middle line:84%
The atrocities that we see
in places like Rwanda, Syria,

00:16:31.240 --> 00:16:33.610 align:middle line:84%
and Nicaragua, the
atrocities of war

00:16:33.610 --> 00:16:35.740 align:middle line:84%
that I mentioned, all
of these, they are only

00:16:35.740 --> 00:16:39.670 align:middle line:84%
possible because of the way you
and I and the people around us

00:16:39.670 --> 00:16:41.730 align:middle line:90%
have been taught to think.

00:16:41.730 --> 00:16:44.900 align:middle line:84%
They're only possible
because of a way of thinking.

00:16:44.900 --> 00:16:49.090 align:middle line:84%
In 1962, there was a woman,
her name was Rachel Carson.

00:16:49.090 --> 00:16:51.140 align:middle line:10%
She was one of the
first environmentalists

00:16:51.140 --> 00:16:52.780 align:middle line:10%
in the modern world.

00:16:52.780 --> 00:16:55.760 align:middle line:84%
I have so much respect,
and I revere her work

00:16:55.760 --> 00:16:57.103 align:middle line:90%
on such a deep level.

00:16:57.103 --> 00:16:58.520 align:middle line:84%
You may be familiar
with her work.

00:16:58.520 --> 00:17:01.820 align:middle line:10%
She wrote a book that was
titled, "Silent Spring,"

00:17:01.820 --> 00:17:05.089 align:middle line:10%
and it was the warning
sign-- the red light

00:17:05.089 --> 00:17:07.609 align:middle line:10%
to the dangers at that time
of the pesticide that was

00:17:07.609 --> 00:17:10.760 align:middle line:10%
being used, it was called DDT.

00:17:10.760 --> 00:17:14.930 align:middle line:84%
And if you're in my age
bracket, you may remember DDT--

00:17:14.930 --> 00:17:18.410 align:middle line:84%
I remember living in the
Midwest in the summer months.

00:17:18.410 --> 00:17:21.319 align:middle line:10%
Trucks would drive up and
down the street spraying

00:17:21.319 --> 00:17:24.470 align:middle line:10%
this cloud, this
gaseous cloud of DDT

00:17:24.470 --> 00:17:26.240 align:middle line:10%
into the gutters
along the street

00:17:26.240 --> 00:17:28.640 align:middle line:10%
to keep mosquitoes
from breeding.

00:17:28.640 --> 00:17:30.290 align:middle line:10%
And while they
were doing that, we

00:17:30.290 --> 00:17:31.880 align:middle line:10%
were told that it was harmless.

00:17:31.880 --> 00:17:35.150 align:middle line:10%
And so kids would follow
right behind the truck playing

00:17:35.150 --> 00:17:36.900 align:middle line:10%
in the cloud of DDT.

00:17:36.900 --> 00:17:40.305 align:middle line:84%
Now I didn't know then what I
know now, but I knew enough--

00:17:40.305 --> 00:17:42.680 align:middle line:84%
I had a sense that something
wasn't right and I was never

00:17:42.680 --> 00:17:45.860 align:middle line:84%
among those young people
and I'm glad that I didn't.

00:17:45.860 --> 00:17:50.240 align:middle line:84%
Because we now know that DDT is
far from a harmless pesticide,

00:17:50.240 --> 00:17:53.390 align:middle line:84%
and we could do a whole
episode based on that.

00:17:53.390 --> 00:17:55.520 align:middle line:84%
But what Rachel Carson
said during that time,

00:17:55.520 --> 00:17:57.340 align:middle line:84%
she made a statement
in that book

00:17:57.340 --> 00:18:00.260 align:middle line:84%
and I want to share it with you,
because it is as potent today

00:18:00.260 --> 00:18:02.000 align:middle line:90%
as it was the 1960s.

00:18:02.000 --> 00:18:05.100 align:middle line:84%
Listen to the wisdom of Rachel
Carson and what she says.

00:18:05.100 --> 00:18:09.320 align:middle line:84%
She says, "We only destroy
what we don't value,

00:18:09.320 --> 00:18:13.040 align:middle line:84%
and we can only value
what we understand."

00:18:13.040 --> 00:18:13.840 align:middle line:90%
Wow.

00:18:13.840 --> 00:18:16.240 align:middle line:84%
Human life is being
destroyed, and it's

00:18:16.240 --> 00:18:19.267 align:middle line:84%
happening right in front of
us at an unprecedented rate.

00:18:19.267 --> 00:18:20.725 align:middle line:84%
And if we're honest
with ourselves,

00:18:20.725 --> 00:18:23.830 align:middle line:90%
you know and I know it's true.

00:18:23.830 --> 00:18:26.860 align:middle line:84%
It's happening and it continues,
and it's only happening

00:18:26.860 --> 00:18:29.140 align:middle line:90%
because of a way of thinking.

00:18:29.140 --> 00:18:31.360 align:middle line:84%
I keep coming back to this,
because everything that

00:18:31.360 --> 00:18:34.340 align:middle line:84%
we're talking about here is
a different way of thinking,

00:18:34.340 --> 00:18:37.900 align:middle line:84%
it's a new way of thinking that
makes the old thinking that

00:18:37.900 --> 00:18:41.590 align:middle line:84%
leads to gains things that
we're talking about obsolete, .

00:18:41.590 --> 00:18:45.340 align:middle line:10%
2009, then President
Barack Obama

00:18:45.340 --> 00:18:49.180 align:middle line:10%
signed into law a
law that should never

00:18:49.180 --> 00:18:52.300 align:middle line:10%
have needed to be created.

00:18:52.300 --> 00:18:56.140 align:middle line:84%
It was called the Matthew
Shepard/James Byrd Hate Crimes

00:18:56.140 --> 00:18:57.940 align:middle line:90%
Prevention Act.

00:18:57.940 --> 00:19:00.460 align:middle line:90%
And it was signed into law--

00:19:00.460 --> 00:19:02.560 align:middle line:84%
in memory of the
lives of the two men

00:19:02.560 --> 00:19:05.560 align:middle line:84%
who were taken at the
same time in 1998-- two

00:19:05.560 --> 00:19:08.150 align:middle line:90%
different incidents in 1998.

00:19:08.150 --> 00:19:12.080 align:middle line:84%
These men lost
their lives in acts

00:19:12.080 --> 00:19:16.100 align:middle line:84%
that were so brutal, that
their stories could only

00:19:16.100 --> 00:19:19.160 align:middle line:84%
be shared on the evening news
after there was a warning that

00:19:19.160 --> 00:19:21.740 align:middle line:84%
preceded the story
telling parents

00:19:21.740 --> 00:19:23.510 align:middle line:84%
that what was about
to be aired might not

00:19:23.510 --> 00:19:26.285 align:middle line:84%
be appropriate for young
people or some audiences.

00:19:26.285 --> 00:19:28.910 align:middle line:84%
I'm not going to go into details
here and I didn't in the book,

00:19:28.910 --> 00:19:30.440 align:middle line:84%
but what I'm going
to say to you is

00:19:30.440 --> 00:19:32.210 align:middle line:90%
what happened to those two men.

00:19:32.210 --> 00:19:34.880 align:middle line:84%
And the reason that
that law was passed

00:19:34.880 --> 00:19:37.790 align:middle line:84%
are all the result of a way
of thinking we've been taught

00:19:37.790 --> 00:19:39.350 align:middle line:90%
that life is not significant.

00:19:39.350 --> 00:19:42.080 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to come back
to this again and again,

00:19:42.080 --> 00:19:48.140 align:middle line:84%
because ultimately, the laws
are only a temporary bandage.

00:19:48.140 --> 00:19:50.780 align:middle line:84%
A law can make it
illegal to hate,

00:19:50.780 --> 00:19:55.760 align:middle line:84%
but a law cannot change the hate
that exists because of a way

00:19:55.760 --> 00:19:57.240 align:middle line:90%
of thinking.

00:19:57.240 --> 00:19:59.660 align:middle line:84%
So if we're ever going
to end the hate that's

00:19:59.660 --> 00:20:03.140 align:middle line:84%
destroying our families, that's
polarizing our societies,

00:20:03.140 --> 00:20:05.900 align:middle line:84%
that's tearing nations
apart, if we're ever

00:20:05.900 --> 00:20:08.840 align:middle line:84%
going to heal this-- to
truly heal it, not just put

00:20:08.840 --> 00:20:10.460 align:middle line:84%
a temporary bandage
on it, you know

00:20:10.460 --> 00:20:12.960 align:middle line:84%
and I know we've got to go right
to the core of the problem,

00:20:12.960 --> 00:20:14.127 align:middle line:90%
and that's what we're doing.

00:20:14.127 --> 00:20:18.140 align:middle line:84%
To the thinking that places
such little value on life--

00:20:18.140 --> 00:20:20.070 align:middle line:90%
on life being so insignificant.

00:20:20.070 --> 00:20:23.540 align:middle line:84%
And what that means
is we got to find ways

00:20:23.540 --> 00:20:25.370 align:middle line:84%
and we need to
find reasons to do

00:20:25.370 --> 00:20:27.770 align:middle line:84%
just that-- to think differently
about ourselves and life

00:20:27.770 --> 00:20:29.090 align:middle line:90%
in general.

00:20:29.090 --> 00:20:30.910 align:middle line:84%
"Missing Links"
gives us a reason

00:20:30.910 --> 00:20:33.270 align:middle line:84%
to do everything
that I've just said.

00:20:33.270 --> 00:20:36.470 align:middle line:84%
So the reasons that I've
shared with you what

00:20:36.470 --> 00:20:38.880 align:middle line:84%
I've shared
throughout this series

00:20:38.880 --> 00:20:40.970 align:middle line:84%
and through the entire
"Missing Link" series

00:20:40.970 --> 00:20:44.250 align:middle line:84%
is because what I'm saying to
you, it's not my speculation,

00:20:44.250 --> 00:20:46.070 align:middle line:84%
it's not my theory,
it's not my hypothesis.

00:20:46.070 --> 00:20:50.930 align:middle line:84%
I get emails asking me about
my theory of the divine matrix.

00:20:50.930 --> 00:20:54.080 align:middle line:84%
What I'm saying to you is based
upon peer-reviewed science--

00:20:54.080 --> 00:20:56.240 align:middle line:84%
now I have synthesized
it in a way

00:20:56.240 --> 00:20:58.130 align:middle line:84%
that you may not
see in other places.

00:20:58.130 --> 00:21:00.237 align:middle line:84%
And I'm not saying that
every scientist is aware

00:21:00.237 --> 00:21:01.820 align:middle line:84%
of what every other
scientist has done

00:21:01.820 --> 00:21:04.460 align:middle line:84%
or that every scientist agrees
with the peer-reviewed science,

00:21:04.460 --> 00:21:06.110 align:middle line:90%
because that's not true.

00:21:06.110 --> 00:21:08.180 align:middle line:10%
But what I am saying
to you is that what

00:21:08.180 --> 00:21:09.920 align:middle line:10%
I'm sharing with you
is well-researched,

00:21:09.920 --> 00:21:12.780 align:middle line:10%
it's documented upon
rock-solid science,

00:21:12.780 --> 00:21:14.860 align:middle line:10%
and it is based upon
the best science

00:21:14.860 --> 00:21:16.400 align:middle line:10%
that the modern
world has to offer.

00:21:16.400 --> 00:21:19.070 align:middle line:84%
Maybe it's going to
change, and when it does,

00:21:19.070 --> 00:21:21.290 align:middle line:84%
science is designed
to be updated,

00:21:21.290 --> 00:21:24.570 align:middle line:84%
and I will update you with a
new science in new episodes.

00:21:24.570 --> 00:21:27.635 align:middle line:84%
But for right now, the best
science of the modern world

00:21:27.635 --> 00:21:29.510 align:middle line:84%
is telling us that
there's a new human story.

00:21:29.510 --> 00:21:31.170 align:middle line:84%
So what I'd like
to do, I'm going

00:21:31.170 --> 00:21:33.770 align:middle line:84%
to take just a few
moments and I want

00:21:33.770 --> 00:21:36.590 align:middle line:84%
to summarize the
reasons that science

00:21:36.590 --> 00:21:38.420 align:middle line:84%
is giving us to change
the way we think--

00:21:38.420 --> 00:21:40.460 align:middle line:84%
the essence of the
new human story,

00:21:40.460 --> 00:21:45.180 align:middle line:84%
and then where the divine
matrix fits into that story.

00:21:45.180 --> 00:21:47.600 align:middle line:84%
So I'm going to
begin our summary

00:21:47.600 --> 00:21:49.990 align:middle line:84%
with the foundation
of our reality

00:21:49.990 --> 00:21:54.500 align:middle line:84%
and the new thinking
regarding this reality

00:21:54.500 --> 00:21:57.410 align:middle line:84%
that we live in that
gives us new ways to think

00:21:57.410 --> 00:22:00.110 align:middle line:84%
about the deepest
experiences and the most

00:22:00.110 --> 00:22:02.160 align:middle line:90%
important questions of life.

00:22:02.160 --> 00:22:03.950 align:middle line:90%
Where does life come from?

00:22:03.950 --> 00:22:05.120 align:middle line:90%
What is God?

00:22:05.120 --> 00:22:06.110 align:middle line:90%
What is death?

00:22:06.110 --> 00:22:07.460 align:middle line:90%
What is life?

00:22:07.460 --> 00:22:10.670 align:middle line:84%
When we pray what
are we praying to?

00:22:10.670 --> 00:22:11.630 align:middle line:90%
What are angels?

00:22:11.630 --> 00:22:13.190 align:middle line:90%
Where do they come from?

00:22:13.190 --> 00:22:15.680 align:middle line:84%
All of these kinds
of questions now

00:22:15.680 --> 00:22:18.080 align:middle line:84%
are being answered in a
new way through the growing

00:22:18.080 --> 00:22:22.670 align:middle line:84%
body of scientific evidence that
we shared in season number 2

00:22:22.670 --> 00:22:24.610 align:middle line:90%
of "Missing Links."

00:22:24.610 --> 00:22:28.270 align:middle line:84%
The evidence that suggests that
you and I are living, in fact,

00:22:28.270 --> 00:22:30.483 align:middle line:90%
in a simulated reality.

00:22:30.483 --> 00:22:31.900 align:middle line:84%
Doesn't mean that
we're not real--

00:22:31.900 --> 00:22:35.200 align:middle line:84%
we're very real to one
another, but that means that

00:22:35.200 --> 00:22:37.870 align:middle line:84%
there's more to us than what
we have been led to believe

00:22:37.870 --> 00:22:40.203 align:middle line:84%
that's happening here, and
there's another world that we

00:22:40.203 --> 00:22:43.750 align:middle line:84%
cannot see that is influencing
what is happening for you and I

00:22:43.750 --> 00:22:45.380 align:middle line:90%
in this world.

00:22:45.380 --> 00:22:48.190 align:middle line:84%
Remember, this growing
body of evidence

00:22:48.190 --> 00:22:51.190 align:middle line:84%
that suggests that
consciousness informs itself

00:22:51.190 --> 00:22:52.990 align:middle line:90%
through its creations.

00:22:52.990 --> 00:22:56.680 align:middle line:84%
Books, music,
television, and movies.

00:22:56.680 --> 00:23:00.290 align:middle line:10%
Think about the powerful
movies of other realities--

00:23:00.290 --> 00:23:04.620 align:middle line:10%
"The Matrix," "Avatar,"
"Inception," and more.

00:23:04.620 --> 00:23:06.370 align:middle line:84%
Let's say there's
another world out there,

00:23:06.370 --> 00:23:08.787 align:middle line:84%
and I'm not saying everything
in those movies is accurate,

00:23:08.787 --> 00:23:12.010 align:middle line:84%
but the themes are reminding
us of what the science is now

00:23:12.010 --> 00:23:15.160 align:middle line:84%
showing us, is that there's
a growing body of evidence,

00:23:15.160 --> 00:23:18.550 align:middle line:84%
and the odds are better that
we are in a simulated reality

00:23:18.550 --> 00:23:20.020 align:middle line:90%
than that we are not--

00:23:20.020 --> 00:23:23.020 align:middle line:84%
a simulated experience,
a simulated reality

00:23:23.020 --> 00:23:24.790 align:middle line:90%
of a virtual world.

00:23:24.790 --> 00:23:27.940 align:middle line:84%
So that is the first
new way of thinking

00:23:27.940 --> 00:23:30.713 align:middle line:84%
that lays the foundation
for everything else that

00:23:30.713 --> 00:23:33.130 align:middle line:84%
is happening that we've shared
through the series "Missing

00:23:33.130 --> 00:23:34.210 align:middle line:90%
Links."

00:23:34.210 --> 00:23:36.910 align:middle line:84%
The second discovery
is about where we fit

00:23:36.910 --> 00:23:38.582 align:middle line:90%
into that simulated reality.

00:23:38.582 --> 00:23:40.540 align:middle line:84%
And I want to tell you
this and be very clear--

00:23:40.540 --> 00:23:44.200 align:middle line:84%
I am a degreed geologist
an earth scientist,

00:23:44.200 --> 00:23:46.620 align:middle line:84%
I've worked in the universities
and the corporations,

00:23:46.620 --> 00:23:48.370 align:middle line:84%
and what I'm going to
say to you right now

00:23:48.370 --> 00:23:50.690 align:middle line:84%
is 180 degrees
opposed to everything

00:23:50.690 --> 00:23:52.940 align:middle line:84%
that I've been taught and
what you have been taught,

00:23:52.940 --> 00:23:55.840 align:middle line:84%
and it is also with
the evidence supports.

00:23:55.840 --> 00:23:57.050 align:middle line:90%
Evolution.

00:23:57.050 --> 00:24:00.700 align:middle line:84%
Darwin's story of evolution is
a fact for some forms of life.

00:24:00.700 --> 00:24:03.040 align:middle line:84%
For many animals, for many
plants, for many insects,

00:24:03.040 --> 00:24:05.240 align:middle line:84%
I've seen it in
the fossil record.

00:24:05.240 --> 00:24:08.080 align:middle line:84%
The story breaks down when
it comes to you and me.

00:24:08.080 --> 00:24:11.560 align:middle line:84%
We are not the product of
Darwin's idea of evolution.

00:24:11.560 --> 00:24:14.110 align:middle line:84%
What we now know is the
physical evidence simply

00:24:14.110 --> 00:24:16.040 align:middle line:90%
does not support it.

00:24:16.040 --> 00:24:17.620 align:middle line:90%
The physical evidence never has.

00:24:17.620 --> 00:24:20.950 align:middle line:10%
When we look at those
ancient forms of life

00:24:20.950 --> 00:24:24.070 align:middle line:10%
on the tree, what's called
the evolutionary tree of life

00:24:24.070 --> 00:24:28.660 align:middle line:10%
and we see us as modern humans
connected, the lines that

00:24:28.660 --> 00:24:31.360 align:middle line:10%
connect us, they're all
broken or dashed lines

00:24:31.360 --> 00:24:33.310 align:middle line:10%
because they are
inferred lines, they

00:24:33.310 --> 00:24:35.380 align:middle line:10%
are speculative relationships.

00:24:35.380 --> 00:24:37.480 align:middle line:84%
They're believed to
exist, the evidence

00:24:37.480 --> 00:24:40.820 align:middle line:84%
has never been found to support
the fact that they exist.

00:24:40.820 --> 00:24:43.990 align:middle line:84%
The DNA evidence-- number
3, the DNA evidence

00:24:43.990 --> 00:24:46.000 align:middle line:84%
is telling us that
we are not related

00:24:46.000 --> 00:24:47.710 align:middle line:90%
to those other forms of life.

00:24:47.710 --> 00:24:51.250 align:middle line:84%
For example, when we compare
our DNA to Neanderthal DNA

00:24:51.250 --> 00:24:54.460 align:middle line:84%
that we can now extract
from Neanderthal remains,

00:24:54.460 --> 00:24:56.068 align:middle line:84%
their genome and
our genome, there's

00:24:56.068 --> 00:24:58.610 align:middle line:84%
not enough overlap-- we did not
descend from the Neanderthal,

00:24:58.610 --> 00:25:01.060 align:middle line:90%
they are not where we came from.

00:25:01.060 --> 00:25:02.820 align:middle line:84%
But the evidence
is also showing--

00:25:02.820 --> 00:25:06.410 align:middle line:84%
and this is the next discovery--
that you and I emerged--

00:25:06.410 --> 00:25:09.310 align:middle line:84%
modern humans-- we're called
anatomically-modern humans

00:25:09.310 --> 00:25:12.740 align:middle line:84%
showed up on Earth
about 200,000 years ago.

00:25:12.740 --> 00:25:14.890 align:middle line:84%
Here's the kicker--
we haven't changed.

00:25:14.890 --> 00:25:17.590 align:middle line:10%
We showed up 200,000
years ago, our DNA today

00:25:17.590 --> 00:25:20.170 align:middle line:10%
is the same as the
DNA from when we

00:25:20.170 --> 00:25:21.640 align:middle line:10%
showed up to 200,000 years ago.

00:25:21.640 --> 00:25:24.600 align:middle line:10%
We showed up with
a brain 50% larger

00:25:24.600 --> 00:25:26.320 align:middle line:10%
than our nearest
primate relatives--

00:25:26.320 --> 00:25:28.630 align:middle line:10%
than the chimps, orangutans.

00:25:28.630 --> 00:25:31.840 align:middle line:84%
We showed up with an
extended neural network that

00:25:31.840 --> 00:25:35.290 align:middle line:84%
allows us to self-regulate,
and we've explored that

00:25:35.290 --> 00:25:37.810 align:middle line:84%
through the series in a way
that no other form of life

00:25:37.810 --> 00:25:39.580 align:middle line:90%
that we're aware of can do.

00:25:39.580 --> 00:25:41.260 align:middle line:84%
And it was with
us from the moment

00:25:41.260 --> 00:25:43.900 align:middle line:84%
that we appeared-- it did
not develop slowly, gradually

00:25:43.900 --> 00:25:45.550 align:middle line:90%
over a long period of time.

00:25:45.550 --> 00:25:48.550 align:middle line:84%
It is not the
hallmark of evolution.

00:25:48.550 --> 00:25:51.160 align:middle line:84%
Scientists now
recognize this, and it

00:25:51.160 --> 00:25:54.250 align:middle line:84%
has led them to what is
called forbidden territory.

00:25:54.250 --> 00:25:57.050 align:middle line:84%
Because in acknowledging
what I just said,

00:25:57.050 --> 00:25:59.440 align:middle line:84%
they are saying it
appears that there

00:25:59.440 --> 00:26:03.910 align:middle line:84%
is some kind of an intent
underlying what we showed up

00:26:03.910 --> 00:26:05.260 align:middle line:90%
with 200,000 years ago.

00:26:05.260 --> 00:26:07.570 align:middle line:84%
The timing, the
precision with which

00:26:07.570 --> 00:26:11.320 align:middle line:84%
our DNA was fused to give us
the capabilities that we have

00:26:11.320 --> 00:26:15.670 align:middle line:84%
of speech, language, 50% larger
brain than any other primate

00:26:15.670 --> 00:26:18.430 align:middle line:84%
relative, it all happened
at the same time--

00:26:18.430 --> 00:26:21.920 align:middle line:84%
did not happen slowly, gradually
over a long period of time.

00:26:21.920 --> 00:26:23.530 align:middle line:84%
So we showed up,
we haven't changed,

00:26:23.530 --> 00:26:25.420 align:middle line:84%
and we showed up with
all the capabilities

00:26:25.420 --> 00:26:26.730 align:middle line:90%
that we have today.

00:26:26.730 --> 00:26:30.400 align:middle line:84%
The next discovery is
that the DNA is telling us

00:26:30.400 --> 00:26:34.240 align:middle line:84%
precisely how this happened and
what those capabilities are all

00:26:34.240 --> 00:26:35.380 align:middle line:90%
about.

00:26:35.380 --> 00:26:38.710 align:middle line:84%
And the discovery after
that is showing us that once

00:26:38.710 --> 00:26:42.220 align:middle line:84%
we begin to embrace the fact
that we appeared 200,000

00:26:42.220 --> 00:26:45.670 align:middle line:84%
years ago fully enabled,
fully intact with everything

00:26:45.670 --> 00:26:48.580 align:middle line:84%
that we have now,
how do we awaken

00:26:48.580 --> 00:26:51.160 align:middle line:84%
the potential of
our appearance--

00:26:51.160 --> 00:26:52.630 align:middle line:90%
what we showed up with?

00:26:52.630 --> 00:26:56.330 align:middle line:84%
How do we awaken that
in our world today?

00:26:56.330 --> 00:26:59.890 align:middle line:84%
And this is where I invited you
beginning in season number 1--

00:26:59.890 --> 00:27:01.570 align:middle line:90%
heart-brain harmony.

00:27:01.570 --> 00:27:05.260 align:middle line:84%
When we harmonize these two
powerful organs in our bodies

00:27:05.260 --> 00:27:08.980 align:middle line:84%
into a single potent
system, that sets the stage,

00:27:08.980 --> 00:27:13.060 align:middle line:84%
all systems go where we
optimize human potential.

00:27:13.060 --> 00:27:16.720 align:middle line:84%
And once we do that, we
have a myriad opportunities

00:27:16.720 --> 00:27:19.090 align:middle line:84%
as to what we do with
that heart-brain harmony.

00:27:19.090 --> 00:27:22.660 align:middle line:84%
We can activate deep
states of intuition

00:27:22.660 --> 00:27:26.480 align:middle line:84%
on demand, powerful
immune response on demand.

00:27:26.480 --> 00:27:31.280 align:middle line:84%
Longevity enzymes in our body,
we can wake them up on demand.

00:27:31.280 --> 00:27:33.978 align:middle line:84%
We can create resilience
to tremendous change,

00:27:33.978 --> 00:27:36.020 align:middle line:84%
just like we're experiencing
our lives right now,

00:27:36.020 --> 00:27:38.030 align:middle line:90%
on Demand and so much more.

00:27:38.030 --> 00:27:41.270 align:middle line:84%
All of this is happening
within this matrix.

00:27:41.270 --> 00:27:44.510 align:middle line:84%
The next discovery
is the science,

00:27:44.510 --> 00:27:46.790 align:middle line:84%
the science that
we've asked to tell us

00:27:46.790 --> 00:27:50.433 align:middle line:84%
who we are is now coming back
to us with even more answers.

00:27:50.433 --> 00:27:52.350 align:middle line:84%
And they're telling us
that there is, in fact,

00:27:52.350 --> 00:27:54.020 align:middle line:90%
a field of energy--

00:27:54.020 --> 00:27:56.660 align:middle line:84%
the web or the net that our
most ancient and cherished

00:27:56.660 --> 00:27:59.315 align:middle line:84%
spiritual traditions
have always referred to,

00:27:59.315 --> 00:28:01.100 align:middle line:84%
that now scientists
are referring

00:28:01.100 --> 00:28:04.190 align:middle line:84%
to this as the Higgs field,
the discovery in 2012

00:28:04.190 --> 00:28:09.350 align:middle line:84%
that we talked about early in
this series, in this program.

00:28:09.350 --> 00:28:10.740 align:middle line:90%
The Higgs field.

00:28:10.740 --> 00:28:12.540 align:middle line:84%
It is out there,
it is universal,

00:28:12.540 --> 00:28:14.000 align:middle line:90%
it's everywhere all the time.

00:28:14.000 --> 00:28:17.750 align:middle line:84%
It's been with us from the time
of the primal release of energy

00:28:17.750 --> 00:28:19.670 align:middle line:90%
we know is the big bang.

00:28:19.670 --> 00:28:21.030 align:middle line:90%
We know that field is there.

00:28:21.030 --> 00:28:24.770 align:middle line:84%
We also know that
we are that field.

00:28:24.770 --> 00:28:27.170 align:middle line:84%
Once again, it's a very
different way of thinking.

00:28:27.170 --> 00:28:29.750 align:middle line:84%
Every atom in your
body right now

00:28:29.750 --> 00:28:35.220 align:middle line:84%
is emerging from the field
that permeates our existence.

00:28:35.220 --> 00:28:37.160 align:middle line:90%
We are the matrix.

00:28:37.160 --> 00:28:39.790 align:middle line:90%
We are the field.

00:28:39.790 --> 00:28:45.070 align:middle line:84%
The next discovery tells us
that we are biologically wired

00:28:45.070 --> 00:28:46.720 align:middle line:90%
to interact with this field.

00:28:46.720 --> 00:28:49.030 align:middle line:84%
Now I personally
believe-- and this

00:28:49.030 --> 00:28:52.870 align:middle line:84%
is where I'll separate science
fact from my personal beliefs.

00:28:52.870 --> 00:28:54.820 align:middle line:84%
The wiring is so
precise, it appears

00:28:54.820 --> 00:28:56.240 align:middle line:90%
to have an intentionality.

00:28:56.240 --> 00:28:57.280 align:middle line:90%
So I call it a design.

00:28:57.280 --> 00:28:59.200 align:middle line:84%
Now I'm not saying
who or what or why

00:28:59.200 --> 00:29:01.360 align:middle line:84%
because I don't know the
answer, and scientists

00:29:01.360 --> 00:29:03.650 align:middle line:84%
doesn't know either--
that's the whole point.

00:29:03.650 --> 00:29:06.100 align:middle line:84%
We will only know when
we begin to follow

00:29:06.100 --> 00:29:07.470 align:middle line:90%
the evidence the story.

00:29:07.470 --> 00:29:09.670 align:middle line:84%
tells rather than trying
to fit the evidence

00:29:09.670 --> 00:29:11.870 align:middle line:90%
into a pre-existing idea.

00:29:11.870 --> 00:29:14.440 align:middle line:84%
So the new human story,
I've just shared with you

00:29:14.440 --> 00:29:17.080 align:middle line:84%
the essence of the
new human story

00:29:17.080 --> 00:29:19.900 align:middle line:84%
that has unfolded
through "Missing Links"

00:29:19.900 --> 00:29:22.300 align:middle line:90%
and where we are so far.

00:29:22.300 --> 00:29:23.890 align:middle line:90%
The new human story.

00:29:23.890 --> 00:29:28.070 align:middle line:84%
It's a story of connection,
unity, self-empowerment,

00:29:28.070 --> 00:29:30.160 align:middle line:90%
self-regulation.

00:29:30.160 --> 00:29:33.070 align:middle line:84%
Maybe it's no accident
that the new human story

00:29:33.070 --> 00:29:35.260 align:middle line:84%
is emerging now, as I
mentioned before, when

00:29:35.260 --> 00:29:37.000 align:middle line:90%
the world needs it the most.

00:29:37.000 --> 00:29:39.430 align:middle line:84%
When globalization is
forcing us together in ways

00:29:39.430 --> 00:29:43.870 align:middle line:84%
we haven't seen in 5,000 years
of recorded human history.

00:29:43.870 --> 00:29:48.400 align:middle line:10%
Before his death in 1983, a man
that I've always looked up to

00:29:48.400 --> 00:29:51.640 align:middle line:10%
and I hold in very high
esteem, Buckminster Fuller,

00:29:51.640 --> 00:29:53.652 align:middle line:10%
he made a statement
that tells us

00:29:53.652 --> 00:29:56.110 align:middle line:10%
about where we are in the world
right now, and what he said

00:29:56.110 --> 00:29:57.485 align:middle line:10%
is so true, I'm
going to share it

00:29:57.485 --> 00:30:02.580 align:middle line:10%
with you as we bring this part
of our program to a close.

00:30:02.580 --> 00:30:05.680 align:middle line:84%
What Buckminster Fuller
said is that "We will never

00:30:05.680 --> 00:30:09.233 align:middle line:84%
change the world by fighting
the existing reality."

00:30:09.233 --> 00:30:10.900 align:middle line:84%
He says if you want
to change the world,

00:30:10.900 --> 00:30:13.990 align:middle line:84%
create a new model that
makes the old model obsolete.

00:30:13.990 --> 00:30:16.090 align:middle line:84%
You and I are doing
that right now.

00:30:16.090 --> 00:30:17.740 align:middle line:84%
There's a lot of
us in the world,

00:30:17.740 --> 00:30:20.740 align:middle line:84%
and we are embracing
the new discoveries that

00:30:20.740 --> 00:30:23.980 align:middle line:84%
are telling a new human story,
and that is the new model.

00:30:23.980 --> 00:30:28.750 align:middle line:84%
Cooperation of ways of
thinking and being that

00:30:28.750 --> 00:30:31.180 align:middle line:84%
allow us to come
together in community,

00:30:31.180 --> 00:30:34.300 align:middle line:84%
and community is the
answer in times of extremes

00:30:34.300 --> 00:30:36.140 align:middle line:90%
like we're living right now.

00:30:36.140 --> 00:30:39.490 align:middle line:84%
We never change things by
fighting the existing reality.

00:30:39.490 --> 00:30:44.950 align:middle line:84%
Build a new model that makes
the old model obsolete.

00:30:44.950 --> 00:30:47.500 align:middle line:84%
Knowing that we're connected
through the divine matrix

00:30:47.500 --> 00:30:49.570 align:middle line:84%
gives us the reasons
to think differently

00:30:49.570 --> 00:30:53.440 align:middle line:84%
about ourselves, one another,
and ultimately our world.

00:30:53.440 --> 00:30:55.450 align:middle line:84%
And if we've ever needed
to think differently,

00:30:55.450 --> 00:30:57.760 align:middle line:84%
now is clearly the
time as we experience

00:30:57.760 --> 00:31:00.610 align:middle line:84%
this global collision
of people and religions

00:31:00.610 --> 00:31:03.460 align:middle line:84%
and cultures and
genders and worldviews.

00:31:03.460 --> 00:31:04.900 align:middle line:90%
The question is simple.

00:31:04.900 --> 00:31:07.210 align:middle line:10%
The question now
is, do we believe

00:31:07.210 --> 00:31:09.520 align:middle line:10%
that we're worth
the work it takes

00:31:09.520 --> 00:31:11.800 align:middle line:10%
to embrace this
extraordinary potential that

00:31:11.800 --> 00:31:14.120 align:middle line:10%
lives within us and our
relationship to the matrix?

00:31:14.120 --> 00:31:17.110 align:middle line:10%
Well, We won't have to
wait long to know how

00:31:17.110 --> 00:31:18.707 align:middle line:10%
we've answered this question.

00:31:18.707 --> 00:31:20.290 align:middle line:84%
We'll know by the
world that we choose

00:31:20.290 --> 00:31:22.973 align:middle line:90%
to leave for our children.

00:31:22.973 --> 00:31:25.390 align:middle line:84%
I hope you've enjoyed watching
this series as much as I've

00:31:25.390 --> 00:31:27.250 align:middle line:84%
enjoyed creating it
for you, and I just

00:31:27.250 --> 00:31:29.560 align:middle line:84%
want to take this
opportunity to thank you

00:31:29.560 --> 00:31:32.380 align:middle line:84%
for joining me for this
entire season of "Missing

00:31:32.380 --> 00:31:34.540 align:middle line:90%
Links, The Divine matrix--

00:31:34.540 --> 00:31:38.200 align:middle line:84%
Bridging Time, Space,
Miracles, and Belief."
