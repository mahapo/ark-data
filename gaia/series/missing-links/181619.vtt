>>GREGG BRADEN: Hello.

00:00:25.840 --> 00:00:26.798 align:middle line:90%
My name's Gregg Braden.

00:00:26.798 --> 00:00:29.500 align:middle line:10%
And I'd like to welcome you
to this all-new presentation

00:00:29.500 --> 00:00:31.120 align:middle line:10%
of "The Divine Matrix--

00:00:31.120 --> 00:00:34.780 align:middle line:10%
Bridging Time, Space,
Miracles, and Belief."

00:00:34.780 --> 00:00:38.530 align:middle line:84%
In the last episode, we
saw that while time may not

00:00:38.530 --> 00:00:41.200 align:middle line:84%
be as universal as
scientists once thought,

00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:44.819 align:middle line:84%
it appears to be what we think
of as the program that drives

00:00:44.819 --> 00:00:47.110 align:middle line:84%
the events of the world and
the experience of our lives

00:00:47.110 --> 00:00:48.370 align:middle line:90%
forward.

00:00:48.370 --> 00:00:50.080 align:middle line:84%
Well, in the following
episode, we'll

00:00:50.080 --> 00:00:52.480 align:middle line:84%
explore the events
as cycles of time

00:00:52.480 --> 00:00:55.990 align:middle line:84%
and how time patterns allow
us to know and to calculate,

00:00:55.990 --> 00:00:58.450 align:middle line:84%
even predict, when the
experiences of our past

00:00:58.450 --> 00:01:00.100 align:middle line:84%
can show up again
in the present.

00:01:00.100 --> 00:01:03.270 align:middle line:90%


00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:06.000 align:middle line:10%
For anyone who is old enough
to be aware of world events

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:09.760 align:middle line:10%
on September 11, 2001, I know
that you remember that day,

00:01:09.760 --> 00:01:12.130 align:middle line:10%
and you know where you were.

00:01:12.130 --> 00:01:15.210 align:middle line:10%
I was in Australia over 9/11.

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:18.360 align:middle line:10%
I saw the whole event
play out through the news

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:21.780 align:middle line:10%
feeds coming from the Middle
East, coming from Australia,

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:24.570 align:middle line:10%
and coming from Europe and Asia.

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:27.630 align:middle line:84%
And when I finally
returned to my home

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:29.550 align:middle line:84%
a few days later when
the flights resumed,

00:01:29.550 --> 00:01:32.860 align:middle line:84%
I returned home to a very,
very different country.

00:01:32.860 --> 00:01:34.260 align:middle line:90%
The world had changed.

00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:35.520 align:middle line:90%
My country had changed.

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:38.140 align:middle line:84%
The way that I
travel had changed.

00:01:38.140 --> 00:01:42.390 align:middle line:84%
And when I found myself in my
office thinking about what had

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:46.600 align:middle line:84%
just happened-- what was the
impact of 9/11 on the world--

00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:51.000 align:middle line:84%
and if I allowed myself to move
beyond the immediate horrors

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:53.020 align:middle line:84%
that were still
reverberating through my body

00:01:53.020 --> 00:01:56.340 align:middle line:84%
and my emotions, as well as
a country in deep mourning,

00:01:56.340 --> 00:01:59.110 align:middle line:84%
my mind began to ask
questions about the event.

00:01:59.110 --> 00:02:04.800 align:middle line:84%
How could something so massive,
so tragic, happen so quickly?

00:02:04.800 --> 00:02:08.009 align:middle line:84%
And how could it have
happened without us having,

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:10.770 align:middle line:84%
apparently, a clue,
at least consciously,

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:12.120 align:middle line:90%
that it was happening?

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:15.330 align:middle line:84%
Could we have known, is the
question that I was asking.

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:18.540 align:middle line:84%
And the reason I was asking,
because as a scientist,

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:22.140 align:middle line:84%
I'm trained to think of the
world in terms of cycles.

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:24.390 align:middle line:84%
I'm trained to think of
the events of our lives

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:25.470 align:middle line:90%
in terms of cycles.

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:28.260 align:middle line:84%
And so my question was
simply, were the events

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:31.140 align:middle line:84%
of September 11 part
of a pattern that

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:32.460 align:middle line:90%
was unfolding in our lives?

00:02:32.460 --> 00:02:37.740 align:middle line:84%
And if so, were the events of
that pattern following cycles

00:02:37.740 --> 00:02:40.530 align:middle line:84%
that we could have known,
that we could have calculated,

00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:43.180 align:middle line:90%
maybe even predicted?

00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:45.520 align:middle line:84%
Well, interestingly,
my background

00:02:45.520 --> 00:02:48.220 align:middle line:84%
gave me everything
that I needed to answer

00:02:48.220 --> 00:02:50.350 align:middle line:84%
that question for
myself, my background

00:02:50.350 --> 00:02:52.150 align:middle line:90%
in the hard sciences--

00:02:52.150 --> 00:02:54.790 align:middle line:84%
I'm a degreed geologist--
a strong background in life

00:02:54.790 --> 00:02:57.580 align:middle line:84%
sciences, which are
all about cycles,

00:02:57.580 --> 00:03:00.910 align:middle line:84%
as well as my experience
in the corporations, where

00:03:00.910 --> 00:03:04.750 align:middle line:84%
I had the opportunity to
put my scientific background

00:03:04.750 --> 00:03:08.510 align:middle line:84%
to the test, to use it in
problem solving in Fortune 500

00:03:08.510 --> 00:03:09.310 align:middle line:90%
companies.

00:03:09.310 --> 00:03:12.130 align:middle line:84%
All of these
experiences prepared

00:03:12.130 --> 00:03:15.610 align:middle line:84%
me to answer the question
that I had just asked myself.

00:03:15.610 --> 00:03:18.010 align:middle line:10%
Was 9/11 part of a cycle?

00:03:18.010 --> 00:03:20.020 align:middle line:10%
Was the pattern,
it was repeating?

00:03:20.020 --> 00:03:22.510 align:middle line:84%
And if so, could we
recognize the pattern?

00:03:22.510 --> 00:03:24.340 align:middle line:90%
Could I recognize that pattern?

00:03:24.340 --> 00:03:27.700 align:middle line:84%
Well, during the 1980s, I
worked in the defense industry

00:03:27.700 --> 00:03:31.120 align:middle line:84%
as a senior computer
systems designer.

00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:35.080 align:middle line:84%
And I'm sharing it with you
now, because my job at that time

00:03:35.080 --> 00:03:39.310 align:middle line:84%
was to write software
looking for patterns in data,

00:03:39.310 --> 00:03:42.190 align:middle line:84%
the same kinds of patterns
that I now suspected

00:03:42.190 --> 00:03:44.890 align:middle line:84%
were playing out in the
repeating cycles of history

00:03:44.890 --> 00:03:46.550 align:middle line:90%
as 9/11.

00:03:46.550 --> 00:03:49.040 align:middle line:90%
So my thinking was very simple.

00:03:49.040 --> 00:03:52.450 align:middle line:84%
It was based upon
three very fundamental,

00:03:52.450 --> 00:03:54.580 align:middle line:90%
scientifically sound principles.

00:03:54.580 --> 00:03:57.970 align:middle line:10%
Number one, Einstein's
equations forever

00:03:57.970 --> 00:04:00.940 align:middle line:10%
merged our thinking
of time and space

00:04:00.940 --> 00:04:03.190 align:middle line:10%
into the concept of
what we call space-time.

00:04:03.190 --> 00:04:06.850 align:middle line:84%
And we discussed this
in the last episode.

00:04:06.850 --> 00:04:10.000 align:middle line:84%
Number two, that
means that everything

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:12.320 align:middle line:90%
that we know in our lives--

00:04:12.320 --> 00:04:14.020 align:middle line:84%
everything we know
in our world--

00:04:14.020 --> 00:04:17.890 align:middle line:84%
it's happening within
the matrix described

00:04:17.890 --> 00:04:21.044 align:middle line:84%
in the previous
episodes in space-time.

00:04:21.044 --> 00:04:22.960 align:middle line:84%
So no matter what it
is-- all the good things,

00:04:22.960 --> 00:04:25.480 align:middle line:84%
all the bad things, the greatest
joys, the deepest pains--

00:04:25.480 --> 00:04:28.120 align:middle line:84%
everything is happening
within this matrix,

00:04:28.120 --> 00:04:29.610 align:middle line:90%
this field of energy.

00:04:29.610 --> 00:04:32.200 align:middle line:84%
And what this means
is that everything--

00:04:32.200 --> 00:04:35.170 align:middle line:84%
from love and war and peace and
the rise and fall of the stock

00:04:35.170 --> 00:04:37.840 align:middle line:84%
markets and the rise and
fall of civilizations--

00:04:37.840 --> 00:04:40.730 align:middle line:84%
they're all part
of this space-time.

00:04:40.730 --> 00:04:44.830 align:middle line:84%
So if we understand how
space and time are unfolding,

00:04:44.830 --> 00:04:50.230 align:middle line:84%
they are informing us as to
how these cycles are repeating

00:04:50.230 --> 00:04:52.960 align:middle line:84%
and possibly where they
begin in our lives.

00:04:52.960 --> 00:04:55.784 align:middle line:84%
So that brings us to
number three, number three.

00:04:55.784 --> 00:04:57.700 align:middle line:84%
Principle number three,
the things that happen

00:04:57.700 --> 00:04:59.380 align:middle line:90%
in space-time--

00:04:59.380 --> 00:05:02.650 align:middle line:84%
it makes sense that they would
follow the rules of nature--

00:05:02.650 --> 00:05:05.380 align:middle line:84%
natural rhythms,
natural cycles--

00:05:05.380 --> 00:05:08.710 align:middle line:84%
that unfold as
nature's mathematics,

00:05:08.710 --> 00:05:11.920 align:middle line:84%
things like the phi
ratio or the golden mean.

00:05:11.920 --> 00:05:15.070 align:middle line:84%
Number four, all of
this says that we

00:05:15.070 --> 00:05:18.820 align:middle line:84%
can think of the
things that happen

00:05:18.820 --> 00:05:23.950 align:middle line:84%
in time as places within
the cycles of time,

00:05:23.950 --> 00:05:26.251 align:middle line:90%
locations in time.

00:05:26.251 --> 00:05:28.750 align:middle line:84%
And if that's true, it means
those locations can be measured

00:05:28.750 --> 00:05:30.630 align:middle line:90%
and calculated and predicted.

00:05:30.630 --> 00:05:32.720 align:middle line:84%
So it all boils down
to a single key.

00:05:32.720 --> 00:05:34.210 align:middle line:90%
And the key is simply this.

00:05:34.210 --> 00:05:36.970 align:middle line:84%
If you know where
you are in a cycle,

00:05:36.970 --> 00:05:41.110 align:middle line:84%
then you can know when the
conditions that began that

00:05:41.110 --> 00:05:43.210 align:middle line:84%
cycle-- what are
called the seed--

00:05:43.210 --> 00:05:46.710 align:middle line:84%
when that seed
will repeat again.

00:05:46.710 --> 00:05:49.960 align:middle line:84%
So I want to be absolutely clear
about what I'm saying here.

00:05:49.960 --> 00:05:55.270 align:middle line:84%
We're talking about predicting
when the conditions of an event

00:05:55.270 --> 00:05:58.870 align:middle line:84%
may repeat, not necessarily
the event itself.

00:05:58.870 --> 00:06:02.140 align:middle line:84%
And let me just give you an
example of what I mean here.

00:06:02.140 --> 00:06:05.380 align:middle line:84%
I grew up in the Midwest
of the United States

00:06:05.380 --> 00:06:07.460 align:middle line:84%
in Missouri, the
state of Missouri.

00:06:07.460 --> 00:06:11.410 align:middle line:84%
And it was part of a region
that was known as Tornado Alley.

00:06:11.410 --> 00:06:15.430 align:middle line:10%
Tornado Alley is a
geographic location

00:06:15.430 --> 00:06:18.970 align:middle line:10%
where the weather patterns
every year are very predictable.

00:06:18.970 --> 00:06:21.640 align:middle line:10%
When the moist air out
of the Gulf comes up,

00:06:21.640 --> 00:06:24.280 align:middle line:10%
and the cold air from
the Arctic comes down,

00:06:24.280 --> 00:06:29.200 align:middle line:10%
and they meet over the Midwest,
those summer conditions,

00:06:29.200 --> 00:06:32.740 align:middle line:10%
they precipitate the
opportunity for tornadoes

00:06:32.740 --> 00:06:34.780 align:middle line:10%
to appear during
those warm months,

00:06:34.780 --> 00:06:38.060 align:middle line:10%
usually between June,
July, and August.

00:06:38.060 --> 00:06:38.860 align:middle line:90%
So here's the key.

00:06:38.860 --> 00:06:42.490 align:middle line:84%
Those conditions-- the
conditions may be present.

00:06:42.490 --> 00:06:45.310 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't necessarily
mean that a tornado

00:06:45.310 --> 00:06:47.560 align:middle line:90%
is going to happen, OK?

00:06:47.560 --> 00:06:49.990 align:middle line:84%
So the conditions
for the tornado--

00:06:49.990 --> 00:06:52.780 align:middle line:84%
the conditions that
precipitate the tornado--

00:06:52.780 --> 00:06:53.650 align:middle line:90%
may be present.

00:06:53.650 --> 00:06:56.710 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't predict that
there will be a tornado.

00:06:56.710 --> 00:07:00.850 align:middle line:10%
In the same way, when we're
talking about cycles of time,

00:07:00.850 --> 00:07:06.430 align:middle line:10%
if we know an event that
seeded a pattern of energy

00:07:06.430 --> 00:07:09.370 align:middle line:10%
in the cycle, if we
know when that happened,

00:07:09.370 --> 00:07:12.040 align:middle line:10%
and if we know that
that pattern of energy

00:07:12.040 --> 00:07:16.150 align:middle line:10%
is going to follow nature's
laws, nature's mathematics,

00:07:16.150 --> 00:07:18.040 align:middle line:10%
nature's rhythms,
then we can tell,

00:07:18.040 --> 00:07:23.020 align:middle line:10%
when the energy of
that seed returns,

00:07:23.020 --> 00:07:25.400 align:middle line:10%
those are the conditions
that will allow an event.

00:07:25.400 --> 00:07:27.850 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't necessarily mean
that the event will happen,

00:07:27.850 --> 00:07:30.050 align:middle line:84%
because we always
have free will.

00:07:30.050 --> 00:07:34.480 align:middle line:84%
We always have the free will to
determine a different outcome

00:07:34.480 --> 00:07:36.719 align:middle line:90%
within the cycle.

00:07:36.719 --> 00:07:38.260 align:middle line:84%
So I want to be very
clear about what

00:07:38.260 --> 00:07:40.240 align:middle line:84%
we're talking about so
that we can apply this

00:07:40.240 --> 00:07:43.370 align:middle line:84%
to 9/11 and other events
on a global level,

00:07:43.370 --> 00:07:47.090 align:middle line:84%
and ultimately, to the events of
our lives on a personal level.

00:07:47.090 --> 00:07:48.680 align:middle line:84%
For those events to
make sense, we've

00:07:48.680 --> 00:07:51.180 align:middle line:84%
got to understand how these
patterns and rhythms and cycles

00:07:51.180 --> 00:07:51.980 align:middle line:90%
work.

00:07:51.980 --> 00:07:54.910 align:middle line:84%
So I'm going to invite you
to think about it like this.

00:07:54.910 --> 00:07:59.750 align:middle line:84%
A cycle begins with an
event that sets into motion

00:07:59.750 --> 00:08:01.750 align:middle line:90%
a pattern of energy.

00:08:01.750 --> 00:08:07.430 align:middle line:84%
And that pattern will repeat
on a rhythmic basis, following

00:08:07.430 --> 00:08:10.370 align:middle line:84%
the mathematics of
nature, again and again

00:08:10.370 --> 00:08:14.840 align:middle line:84%
and again, until something
changes the pattern.

00:08:14.840 --> 00:08:17.030 align:middle line:84%
So if the pattern
doesn't change then

00:08:17.030 --> 00:08:20.330 align:middle line:84%
the event will
continue to repeat

00:08:20.330 --> 00:08:25.010 align:middle line:84%
on a scale that is
predictable and something

00:08:25.010 --> 00:08:27.290 align:middle line:90%
that we can calculate.

00:08:27.290 --> 00:08:29.180 align:middle line:90%
A perfect example of this--

00:08:29.180 --> 00:08:32.330 align:middle line:84%
in nature, climate is
a cyclic phenomenon.

00:08:32.330 --> 00:08:35.030 align:middle line:84%
The economics of the world
are based upon cycles.

00:08:35.030 --> 00:08:38.210 align:middle line:84%
Human conflict, we
now know, is directly

00:08:38.210 --> 00:08:42.230 align:middle line:84%
linked to the solar cycles,
the cycles of the Sun,

00:08:42.230 --> 00:08:44.330 align:middle line:84%
and how the magnetic
fields of the Sun

00:08:44.330 --> 00:08:46.280 align:middle line:84%
influence the magnetic
fields of the Earth

00:08:46.280 --> 00:08:48.695 align:middle line:84%
and the magnetic fields
of the human heart.

00:08:48.695 --> 00:08:50.480 align:middle line:84%
We talked about
this in episode one.

00:08:50.480 --> 00:08:53.210 align:middle line:84%
When the magnetic
fields are strong,

00:08:53.210 --> 00:08:55.594 align:middle line:84%
humans are more
willing to cooperate.

00:08:55.594 --> 00:08:56.510 align:middle line:90%
We're less aggressive.

00:08:56.510 --> 00:08:58.190 align:middle line:84%
When the magnetic
fields are weak,

00:08:58.190 --> 00:08:59.970 align:middle line:90%
just the opposite happens.

00:08:59.970 --> 00:09:03.170 align:middle line:84%
So I'm sharing these couple
of examples of natural rhythms

00:09:03.170 --> 00:09:07.460 align:middle line:84%
and natural cycles that repeat
again and again and again

00:09:07.460 --> 00:09:11.010 align:middle line:84%
on a rhythmic basis that
can be known and calculated.

00:09:11.010 --> 00:09:13.580 align:middle line:84%
Well, our experiences
as individuals,

00:09:13.580 --> 00:09:16.610 align:middle line:84%
our collective experiences,
our global experiences,

00:09:16.610 --> 00:09:21.110 align:middle line:84%
appear to follow the same
rhythm and the same pattern.

00:09:21.110 --> 00:09:23.255 align:middle line:84%
So what's interesting
about these patterns--

00:09:23.255 --> 00:09:25.630 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to invite you to
think about this in your mind.

00:09:25.630 --> 00:09:28.910 align:middle line:84%
Visualize this on the
whiteboard of your mind.

00:09:28.910 --> 00:09:33.740 align:middle line:84%
A seed event sets into motion
a pattern of energy, all right?

00:09:33.740 --> 00:09:37.520 align:middle line:84%
That seed event can be anything
emotionally significant

00:09:37.520 --> 00:09:40.370 align:middle line:84%
on a global or on a
personal level, all right?

00:09:40.370 --> 00:09:43.340 align:middle line:84%
So the seed event sets
a pattern into motion.

00:09:43.340 --> 00:09:46.430 align:middle line:84%
And the pattern
follows the rhythm.

00:09:46.430 --> 00:09:49.370 align:middle line:84%
And that rhythm
determines-- nature's math

00:09:49.370 --> 00:09:51.560 align:middle line:84%
determines-- when
that cycle ends

00:09:51.560 --> 00:09:53.130 align:middle line:90%
and when the next one begins.

00:09:53.130 --> 00:09:55.787 align:middle line:84%
And this is where it's
especially useful to know

00:09:55.787 --> 00:09:56.870 align:middle line:90%
about we're talking about.

00:09:56.870 --> 00:10:02.360 align:middle line:84%
Because there is a place
between where one cycle ends

00:10:02.360 --> 00:10:04.820 align:middle line:84%
and the next cycle
begins where neither is

00:10:04.820 --> 00:10:07.910 align:middle line:90%
present for a period of time.

00:10:07.910 --> 00:10:11.030 align:middle line:84%
That place is called
the choice point.

00:10:11.030 --> 00:10:14.540 align:middle line:84%
In a choice point, we
have the opportunity

00:10:14.540 --> 00:10:18.740 align:middle line:84%
to change the pattern before
the next cycle begins.

00:10:18.740 --> 00:10:21.530 align:middle line:84%
This is true in our personal
relationships, as you'll see.

00:10:21.530 --> 00:10:24.890 align:middle line:84%
It's also true on a global
level, as you will also see.

00:10:24.890 --> 00:10:28.460 align:middle line:84%
So I'm describing
these principles

00:10:28.460 --> 00:10:31.400 align:middle line:84%
so that we can now go in
and actually apply them

00:10:31.400 --> 00:10:34.760 align:middle line:84%
in a way that helps us to
understand why these events are

00:10:34.760 --> 00:10:36.315 align:middle line:84%
happening the way
they're happening.

00:10:36.315 --> 00:10:37.190 align:middle line:90%
Let me be very clear.

00:10:37.190 --> 00:10:38.120 align:middle line:90%
It doesn't condone.

00:10:38.120 --> 00:10:39.374 align:middle line:90%
It doesn't excuse.

00:10:39.374 --> 00:10:40.790 align:middle line:84%
But it gives us a
greater meaning.

00:10:40.790 --> 00:10:42.998 align:middle line:84%
We step back and look at
the big picture, and we say,

00:10:42.998 --> 00:10:44.420 align:middle line:90%
is the world going crazy?

00:10:44.420 --> 00:10:46.100 align:middle line:90%
The world's not going crazy.

00:10:46.100 --> 00:10:49.350 align:middle line:84%
The world is experiencing
the consequences of patterns

00:10:49.350 --> 00:10:50.690 align:middle line:90%
that have been set into motion.

00:10:50.690 --> 00:10:53.450 align:middle line:84%
And if we know that,
if we are empowered

00:10:53.450 --> 00:10:55.550 align:middle line:84%
to know that we
are also empowered

00:10:55.550 --> 00:11:00.200 align:middle line:84%
to use the opportunity, the
potent opportunity of a choice

00:11:00.200 --> 00:11:04.130 align:middle line:84%
point to change the
patterns in the next cycles.

00:11:04.130 --> 00:11:05.630 align:middle line:84%
I also want to be
very clear that we

00:11:05.630 --> 00:11:07.620 align:middle line:90%
can make a choice anytime.

00:11:07.620 --> 00:11:10.430 align:middle line:84%
So we're not bound only
to the choice point.

00:11:10.430 --> 00:11:12.650 align:middle line:84%
The value of knowing
about the choice point

00:11:12.650 --> 00:11:15.620 align:middle line:84%
is that that is when the
deck is stacked in our favor.

00:11:15.620 --> 00:11:17.750 align:middle line:84%
That is when our
choices can be the most

00:11:17.750 --> 00:11:22.750 align:middle line:84%
potent, because they occur at
a place between the cycles.

00:11:22.750 --> 00:11:24.890 align:middle line:84%
This place of the
between, our ancestors

00:11:24.890 --> 00:11:26.370 align:middle line:90%
have known for a very long time.

00:11:26.370 --> 00:11:29.660 align:middle line:84%
It's the space between
is where the action is.

00:11:29.660 --> 00:11:32.535 align:middle line:84%
We talk about
prayer, for example.

00:11:32.535 --> 00:11:34.160 align:middle line:84%
Our ancestors have
always told us there

00:11:34.160 --> 00:11:37.269 align:middle line:84%
are two times during
a day on Earth,

00:11:37.269 --> 00:11:39.560 align:middle line:84%
a day in this world, when
our prayers could be the most

00:11:39.560 --> 00:11:40.360 align:middle line:90%
potent.

00:11:40.360 --> 00:11:41.870 align:middle line:90%
It's the time in between.

00:11:41.870 --> 00:11:47.750 align:middle line:84%
It is in the morning when
the light shows in the sky,

00:11:47.750 --> 00:11:49.220 align:middle line:90%
yet the sun has not appeared.

00:11:49.220 --> 00:11:52.280 align:middle line:84%
So it's not really nighttime,
yet it's not daytime.

00:11:52.280 --> 00:11:54.710 align:middle line:84%
It's called the crack
between the worlds.

00:11:54.710 --> 00:11:57.800 align:middle line:84%
And the crack between the
worlds happens again at dusk.

00:11:57.800 --> 00:12:00.460 align:middle line:84%
The sun disappears, but
the sky is still light.

00:12:00.460 --> 00:12:02.150 align:middle line:90%
The stars aren't out yet.

00:12:02.150 --> 00:12:04.370 align:middle line:84%
That is the time when
it is the most potent

00:12:04.370 --> 00:12:07.820 align:middle line:84%
to offer our prayers,
according to our indigenous

00:12:07.820 --> 00:12:10.850 align:middle line:90%
and ancient traditions.

00:12:10.850 --> 00:12:13.490 align:middle line:84%
Well, quantum physics
tells us the same thing--

00:12:13.490 --> 00:12:18.140 align:middle line:84%
that we are not continuous
beings, that we are pulsing,

00:12:18.140 --> 00:12:19.930 align:middle line:90%
pulsing fields of quanta.

00:12:19.930 --> 00:12:23.540 align:middle line:84%
This is the qualities of light--
little packets of light--

00:12:23.540 --> 00:12:26.160 align:middle line:84%
that are the study
of quantum physics.

00:12:26.160 --> 00:12:28.100 align:middle line:90%
So we are not continuous.

00:12:28.100 --> 00:12:31.447 align:middle line:84%
And it's the space between
each of those quantum bursts

00:12:31.447 --> 00:12:33.280 align:middle line:84%
is where we have the
opportunity for change.

00:12:33.280 --> 00:12:35.060 align:middle line:84%
Well, it's hard to
time that change.

00:12:35.060 --> 00:12:36.590 align:middle line:84%
As you'll see in
later episodes, you

00:12:36.590 --> 00:12:39.710 align:middle line:84%
don't have to, because there are
states of consciousness where

00:12:39.710 --> 00:12:43.730 align:middle line:84%
we can grab onto the space in
between to make the change.

00:12:43.730 --> 00:12:46.260 align:middle line:84%
I'm just sharing this so that
you know the principles we're

00:12:46.260 --> 00:12:47.060 align:middle line:90%
talking about.

00:12:47.060 --> 00:12:48.860 align:middle line:84%
These are universal
principles that

00:12:48.860 --> 00:12:50.870 align:middle line:90%
apply to the world around us.

00:12:50.870 --> 00:12:52.160 align:middle line:90%
They're not metaphors.

00:12:52.160 --> 00:12:54.380 align:middle line:84%
And they're not something
that someone just made up

00:12:54.380 --> 00:12:56.930 align:middle line:90%
for this specific episode, OK?

00:12:56.930 --> 00:13:00.140 align:middle line:84%
So with these ideas
in mind, I want

00:13:00.140 --> 00:13:02.090 align:middle line:84%
to take a look at
what these cycles mean

00:13:02.090 --> 00:13:05.505 align:middle line:90%
to us, what 9/11 meant to us.

00:13:05.505 --> 00:13:07.670 align:middle line:84%
As I began to consider
everything that I've just

00:13:07.670 --> 00:13:09.140 align:middle line:90%
shared with you--

00:13:09.140 --> 00:13:13.170 align:middle line:84%
the role of cycles, nature's
rhythms, nature's mathematics,

00:13:13.170 --> 00:13:15.620 align:middle line:90%
what cycles mean in our lives--

00:13:15.620 --> 00:13:19.100 align:middle line:84%
I used my background in
computer science and math

00:13:19.100 --> 00:13:21.140 align:middle line:84%
and the physical
sciences to build

00:13:21.140 --> 00:13:23.570 align:middle line:84%
an algorithm that
reflected everything

00:13:23.570 --> 00:13:25.000 align:middle line:90%
that I've just shared.

00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:27.410 align:middle line:84%
And I wanted to
test this algorithm

00:13:27.410 --> 00:13:30.890 align:middle line:84%
to see if it would
give me personally

00:13:30.890 --> 00:13:34.280 align:middle line:84%
a greater meaning to the horror
that I'd experienced as 9/11.

00:13:34.280 --> 00:13:38.600 align:middle line:90%


00:13:38.600 --> 00:13:43.640 align:middle line:84%
So I developed what I now
call a time code calculator.

00:13:43.640 --> 00:13:46.650 align:middle line:84%
And you're seeing an image of
this calculator on the screen.

00:13:46.650 --> 00:13:53.180 align:middle line:84%
It is a very simple interface
that allows us to enter

00:13:53.180 --> 00:13:57.530 align:middle line:84%
a series of parameters,
including dates of when

00:13:57.530 --> 00:14:01.070 align:middle line:84%
specific events have
happened, so that we can use

00:14:01.070 --> 00:14:03.860 align:middle line:84%
the algorithm--
nature's mathematics--

00:14:03.860 --> 00:14:08.390 align:middle line:84%
to determine when a pattern
of energy would repeat,

00:14:08.390 --> 00:14:12.410 align:middle line:84%
when a pattern such as 9/11
would repeat in our lives

00:14:12.410 --> 00:14:13.450 align:middle line:90%
again.

00:14:13.450 --> 00:14:14.250 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:14:14.250 --> 00:14:17.840 align:middle line:84%
Using the calculator that you
see on the screen and mode

00:14:17.840 --> 00:14:20.210 align:middle line:84%
number one-- and mode
number one is the mode

00:14:20.210 --> 00:14:24.440 align:middle line:84%
that helps us to understand
when an event of the past

00:14:24.440 --> 00:14:28.550 align:middle line:84%
will repeat again in a
particular cycle of time.

00:14:28.550 --> 00:14:31.410 align:middle line:90%
That's mode number one.

00:14:31.410 --> 00:14:33.800 align:middle line:84%
The second field
on the calculator

00:14:33.800 --> 00:14:37.970 align:middle line:84%
is the cycle within which
the event is happening.

00:14:37.970 --> 00:14:40.280 align:middle line:84%
And these are huge
cycles of time.

00:14:40.280 --> 00:14:42.440 align:middle line:84%
And for this
particular calculator,

00:14:42.440 --> 00:14:48.020 align:middle line:84%
I used a Mayan cycle
of 1,872,000 days,

00:14:48.020 --> 00:14:52.700 align:middle line:84%
or the 5,125-year cycle,
based upon cosmic events that

00:14:52.700 --> 00:14:54.800 align:middle line:84%
we've talked about
in other programs.

00:14:54.800 --> 00:14:57.540 align:middle line:84%
And I'll talk about it again
here in just a few moments.

00:14:57.540 --> 00:15:00.650 align:middle line:84%
So for the purposes of
what we're doing now,

00:15:00.650 --> 00:15:05.750 align:middle line:84%
the 5,000-year cycle is what I
entered into the second field.

00:15:05.750 --> 00:15:07.550 align:middle line:84%
In the third field,
the calculator

00:15:07.550 --> 00:15:14.810 align:middle line:84%
asks for the seed date for the
event that we are exploring.

00:15:14.810 --> 00:15:18.350 align:middle line:10%
So I'm going to use September
11, 2001 as an example of what

00:15:18.350 --> 00:15:20.430 align:middle line:10%
I'm talking about here.

00:15:20.430 --> 00:15:25.582 align:middle line:10%
So when we think about September
11, 2001, and we ask ourselves,

00:15:25.582 --> 00:15:28.040 align:middle line:10%
what are the qualities-- the
characteristics-- that make it

00:15:28.040 --> 00:15:29.015 align:middle line:10%
so unique?

00:15:29.015 --> 00:15:32.150 align:middle line:84%
Well, number one, I think it's
fair to say for most people

00:15:32.150 --> 00:15:36.350 align:middle line:84%
that the event was a
surprise, number two, that it

00:15:36.350 --> 00:15:40.340 align:middle line:84%
was an unexpected attack
on the United States.

00:15:40.340 --> 00:15:45.620 align:middle line:84%
So the way that we would
find a seed event for 9/11

00:15:45.620 --> 00:15:50.270 align:middle line:84%
is by asking ourselves when
in the past, before 9/11,

00:15:50.270 --> 00:15:53.930 align:middle line:84%
was America attacked
in a surprise manner?

00:15:53.930 --> 00:15:56.480 align:middle line:84%
And that date would
become the date

00:15:56.480 --> 00:15:58.740 align:middle line:84%
that we would enter
for the seed that

00:15:58.740 --> 00:16:04.680 align:middle line:84%
set into motion the pattern for
what we experienced as 9/11.

00:16:04.680 --> 00:16:06.680 align:middle line:84%
We don't have to look
very far to find the date,

00:16:06.680 --> 00:16:11.180 align:middle line:84%
because the date is
December 7, 1941.

00:16:11.180 --> 00:16:14.780 align:middle line:84%
It is a day that then-President
Franklin Roosevelt

00:16:14.780 --> 00:16:19.080 align:middle line:84%
named as a day of infamy, a day
that would go down in history.

00:16:19.080 --> 00:16:22.340 align:middle line:84%
It was the surprise and
the attack of America

00:16:22.340 --> 00:16:25.100 align:middle line:90%
in Pearl Harbor, Hawaii.

00:16:25.100 --> 00:16:30.440 align:middle line:84%
So this was what I
found as an event that

00:16:30.440 --> 00:16:34.340 align:middle line:84%
matched the characteristics of
what we experienced as 9/11.

00:16:34.340 --> 00:16:37.680 align:middle line:84%
This is what I used as the seed
to plant into the calculator.

00:16:37.680 --> 00:16:42.350 align:middle line:84%
So my thinking is that this
event, the Pearl Harbor attack,

00:16:42.350 --> 00:16:44.990 align:middle line:84%
set into motion a
pattern of energy that

00:16:44.990 --> 00:16:48.140 align:middle line:84%
would repeat on a rhythmic,
cyclic basis, the pattern

00:16:48.140 --> 00:16:50.790 align:middle line:84%
of America being
surprised and attacked.

00:16:50.790 --> 00:16:56.510 align:middle line:84%
And if so, from the seed date,
it should give us 9/11 as one

00:16:56.510 --> 00:17:01.080 align:middle line:84%
of the fractal cycles
of the repeating time.

00:17:01.080 --> 00:17:02.720 align:middle line:84%
So when we plug
in the date and we

00:17:02.720 --> 00:17:05.750 align:middle line:84%
allow the algorithm to do
what the algorithm does,

00:17:05.750 --> 00:17:06.750 align:middle line:90%
what we find is this.

00:17:06.750 --> 00:17:09.109 align:middle line:84%
The first output
from the calculator

00:17:09.109 --> 00:17:11.900 align:middle line:84%
is a date that
surprised me at first--

00:17:11.900 --> 00:17:15.619 align:middle line:84%
surprised a lot of people
that were seeing this.

00:17:15.619 --> 00:17:19.910 align:middle line:84%
The first fractal gave
me the date of 1984.

00:17:19.910 --> 00:17:21.016 align:middle line:90%
And I looked at 1984.

00:17:21.016 --> 00:17:22.640 align:middle line:84%
And I said, well,
there was no surprise

00:17:22.640 --> 00:17:26.119 align:middle line:90%
attack of America in 1984.

00:17:26.119 --> 00:17:27.740 align:middle line:90%
But I looked a little closer.

00:17:27.740 --> 00:17:30.950 align:middle line:84%
And what I discovered is that
there was a planned surprise

00:17:30.950 --> 00:17:33.270 align:middle line:90%
attack on America in 1984.

00:17:33.270 --> 00:17:35.870 align:middle line:84%
And let me just tell you a
little bit about what happened.

00:17:35.870 --> 00:17:42.350 align:middle line:84%
In September of 1983, there
was a Boeing 747 aircraft.

00:17:42.350 --> 00:17:45.230 align:middle line:84%
It was a Korean airliner
aircraft that had accidentally

00:17:45.230 --> 00:17:48.800 align:middle line:90%
strayed into Russian airspace.

00:17:48.800 --> 00:17:51.260 align:middle line:84%
This was during the
height of the Cold War.

00:17:51.260 --> 00:17:53.300 align:middle line:90%
Suspicions were high.

00:17:53.300 --> 00:18:00.110 align:middle line:84%
And that plane was shot
down, and all 269 people

00:18:00.110 --> 00:18:03.830 align:middle line:84%
aboard that plane were killed,
including a US Congressman.

00:18:03.830 --> 00:18:06.110 align:middle line:90%
His name was Lawrence McDonald.

00:18:06.110 --> 00:18:09.560 align:middle line:84%
Now because of the thinking
during the Cold War--

00:18:09.560 --> 00:18:11.120 align:middle line:84%
the Russians knowing
that they had

00:18:11.120 --> 00:18:18.380 align:middle line:84%
downed the civilian aircraft,
Korean airline 747 jumbo jet,

00:18:18.380 --> 00:18:23.120 align:middle line:84%
with all 269 people aboard--
and because an American diplomat

00:18:23.120 --> 00:18:29.300 align:middle line:84%
was on that aircraft, they
expected that the United States

00:18:29.300 --> 00:18:31.820 align:middle line:90%
would retaliate against them.

00:18:31.820 --> 00:18:34.640 align:middle line:84%
And in an effort to
prevent that retaliation,

00:18:34.640 --> 00:18:38.450 align:middle line:84%
they preemptively
planned a major strike--

00:18:38.450 --> 00:18:41.600 align:middle line:84%
an attack, a surprise
attack-- on the United States

00:18:41.600 --> 00:18:44.150 align:middle line:84%
that was thwarted
for reasons that

00:18:44.150 --> 00:18:46.220 align:middle line:84%
are still very mysterious
in the history books.

00:18:46.220 --> 00:18:50.000 align:middle line:84%
The point is that the fractal
time calculator had calculated

00:18:50.000 --> 00:18:52.260 align:middle line:90%
that date as the date.

00:18:52.260 --> 00:18:55.670 align:middle line:84%
1984 is when the attack
was planned to happen.

00:18:55.670 --> 00:18:57.470 align:middle line:90%
The event happened in '83.

00:18:57.470 --> 00:19:01.100 align:middle line:84%
The surprise attack was
planned for the spring of '84.

00:19:01.100 --> 00:19:03.950 align:middle line:84%
And that is precisely when
the calculator told us

00:19:03.950 --> 00:19:07.710 align:middle line:84%
that the pattern recurred,
where we could expect a surprise

00:19:07.710 --> 00:19:10.070 align:middle line:90%
attack on America again.

00:19:10.070 --> 00:19:14.600 align:middle line:84%
Once I found that, I said,
well, it's telling us something.

00:19:14.600 --> 00:19:18.500 align:middle line:84%
What I did was I took that
date, then, as the new seed,

00:19:18.500 --> 00:19:20.600 align:middle line:84%
plugged it back
into the calculator.

00:19:20.600 --> 00:19:22.850 align:middle line:84%
And lo and behold,
the calculator

00:19:22.850 --> 00:19:26.120 align:middle line:84%
told me that March
of 2001 was the date.

00:19:26.120 --> 00:19:29.860 align:middle line:84%
And we now know that is actually
the date that the planning was

00:19:29.860 --> 00:19:30.660 align:middle line:90%
occurring.

00:19:30.660 --> 00:19:33.710 align:middle line:10%
That is when consciousness,
in consciousness, the energy

00:19:33.710 --> 00:19:35.930 align:middle line:10%
of 9/11 was being created.

00:19:35.930 --> 00:19:38.700 align:middle line:84%
And it actually was
carried out on 9/11.

00:19:38.700 --> 00:19:41.480 align:middle line:84%
And the calculator gave
me both of those dates.

00:19:41.480 --> 00:19:44.210 align:middle line:84%
So with this in
mind, suddenly, I

00:19:44.210 --> 00:19:47.570 align:middle line:84%
knew that this
calculator was correct.

00:19:47.570 --> 00:19:50.210 align:middle line:84%
And it gave us the
ability to look

00:19:50.210 --> 00:19:54.500 align:middle line:84%
into the past for big events
in the world, like 9/11.

00:19:54.500 --> 00:19:56.570 align:middle line:84%
And I began to apply
it to other events

00:19:56.570 --> 00:20:00.170 align:middle line:84%
just to see if it could
give us some sense--

00:20:00.170 --> 00:20:01.295 align:middle line:90%
help us to make sense--

00:20:01.295 --> 00:20:02.670 align:middle line:84%
of what's happening
in the world.

00:20:02.670 --> 00:20:04.044 align:middle line:84%
Now I want to
share with you some

00:20:04.044 --> 00:20:06.470 align:middle line:84%
of these other events,
because they pointed to a very

00:20:06.470 --> 00:20:07.430 align:middle line:90%
interesting phenomenon.

00:20:07.430 --> 00:20:10.070 align:middle line:84%
And the phenomenon brought
me to the realization

00:20:10.070 --> 00:20:12.769 align:middle line:84%
of really good news in
your life, in my life,

00:20:12.769 --> 00:20:14.310 align:middle line:84%
in your world, in
my world right now.

00:20:14.310 --> 00:20:16.560 align:middle line:84%
And that's what I want
to share with you.

00:20:16.560 --> 00:20:19.220 align:middle line:84%
So as I began to look at
other significant dates,

00:20:19.220 --> 00:20:21.950 align:middle line:84%
I chose dates of
global events that

00:20:21.950 --> 00:20:25.940 align:middle line:84%
were undeniable-- so for
example, the First World War.

00:20:25.940 --> 00:20:29.420 align:middle line:84%
The First World War-- the
seed for First World War--

00:20:29.420 --> 00:20:31.070 align:middle line:90%
was 1914.

00:20:31.070 --> 00:20:35.930 align:middle line:84%
That planted a seed that set
into motion a pattern of energy

00:20:35.930 --> 00:20:38.780 align:middle line:90%
that would repeat as World War--

00:20:38.780 --> 00:20:40.760 align:middle line:90%
the conditions for World War--

00:20:40.760 --> 00:20:42.590 align:middle line:90%
again and again and again.

00:20:42.590 --> 00:20:45.230 align:middle line:84%
Lo and behold, the
date hit exactly

00:20:45.230 --> 00:20:47.330 align:middle line:90%
on the date for World War II.

00:20:47.330 --> 00:20:49.640 align:middle line:84%
It hit on possible
dates in between.

00:20:49.640 --> 00:20:52.717 align:middle line:90%
It hit on a date of 2016.

00:20:52.717 --> 00:20:54.800 align:middle line:10%
I want you to hold that
in mind, because I'm going

00:20:54.800 --> 00:20:56.510 align:middle line:10%
to talk about other dates.

00:20:56.510 --> 00:20:58.820 align:middle line:84%
I plugged in the
first date, when

00:20:58.820 --> 00:21:04.294 align:middle line:84%
the world saw a global pandemic,
the epidemic of the flu.

00:21:04.294 --> 00:21:06.710 align:middle line:84%
This was the first time in the
20th century this happened.

00:21:06.710 --> 00:21:08.590 align:middle line:90%
The year was 1918.

00:21:08.590 --> 00:21:13.400 align:middle line:84%
So 1918 became the seed for
when we could reasonably

00:21:13.400 --> 00:21:17.255 align:middle line:84%
expect the conditions of
this pattern to repeat.

00:21:17.255 --> 00:21:19.740 align:middle line:84%
And again, not necessarily
the actual event,

00:21:19.740 --> 00:21:22.130 align:middle line:84%
but when would those
conditions repeat?

00:21:22.130 --> 00:21:25.520 align:middle line:84%
Well, I got a lot of other dates
that came with this, including

00:21:25.520 --> 00:21:27.320 align:middle line:90%
the date of 2016.

00:21:27.320 --> 00:21:29.660 align:middle line:84%
You're seeing a
pattern develop here.

00:21:29.660 --> 00:21:31.340 align:middle line:90%
I looked at global collapse.

00:21:31.340 --> 00:21:33.800 align:middle line:84%
When is the first time
we had a global collapse

00:21:33.800 --> 00:21:35.270 align:middle line:90%
of the economic system?

00:21:35.270 --> 00:21:39.290 align:middle line:84%
1929 was the seed date
for an economic collapse.

00:21:39.290 --> 00:21:42.110 align:middle line:84%
When could we reasonably
expect for the conditions

00:21:42.110 --> 00:21:44.610 align:middle line:84%
of that economic
collapse to happen again?

00:21:44.610 --> 00:21:46.220 align:middle line:84%
Well, a number of
other dates came up.

00:21:46.220 --> 00:21:47.390 align:middle line:90%
Those dates have all passed.

00:21:47.390 --> 00:21:50.450 align:middle line:90%
The last date was 2016.

00:21:50.450 --> 00:21:54.290 align:middle line:84%
So when we look at
this, what is happening

00:21:54.290 --> 00:21:56.330 align:middle line:90%
with this date of 2016?

00:21:56.330 --> 00:22:00.450 align:middle line:84%
Why is that date repeating
again and again and again?

00:22:00.450 --> 00:22:02.480 align:middle line:84%
So I'm going to go back
to the first seed date

00:22:02.480 --> 00:22:04.590 align:middle line:90%
that we talked about after 9/11.

00:22:04.590 --> 00:22:08.030 align:middle line:84%
That was the seed date
for global war, 1914.

00:22:08.030 --> 00:22:11.150 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to read to
you the dates that

00:22:11.150 --> 00:22:15.510 align:middle line:84%
came up as opportunities for
that pattern to repeat again.

00:22:15.510 --> 00:22:20.110 align:middle line:84%
After 1914, the
first seed was 1973.

00:22:20.110 --> 00:22:22.320 align:middle line:90%
After that, the repeat was 1997.

00:22:22.320 --> 00:22:25.200 align:middle line:90%
After that, the repeat was 2006.

00:22:25.200 --> 00:22:30.570 align:middle line:84%
After that, the repeat was
2009, then 2011, then 2012, then

00:22:30.570 --> 00:22:32.040 align:middle line:90%
2016.

00:22:32.040 --> 00:22:34.410 align:middle line:84%
Can you see what's
happening here?

00:22:34.410 --> 00:22:38.310 align:middle line:84%
Can you see that the time
between each of those dates

00:22:38.310 --> 00:22:41.220 align:middle line:84%
is getting closer and
closer and closer together?

00:22:41.220 --> 00:22:46.155 align:middle line:84%
For example, between 1914
and 1973, that's 59 years.

00:22:46.155 --> 00:22:49.830 align:middle line:84%
Between 1973 and
'97, that's 24 years.

00:22:49.830 --> 00:22:52.710 align:middle line:84%
Between 1997 and 2006,
that's nine years.

00:22:52.710 --> 00:22:56.130 align:middle line:90%
2006 to 2009 is three years.

00:22:56.130 --> 00:22:58.210 align:middle line:90%
2009 to '11 is two years.

00:22:58.210 --> 00:23:00.970 align:middle line:90%
2011 to 2012 is one year.

00:23:00.970 --> 00:23:02.850 align:middle line:90%
Can you see what's happening?

00:23:02.850 --> 00:23:07.320 align:middle line:84%
As we get closer to
the end of the cycle,

00:23:07.320 --> 00:23:13.050 align:middle line:84%
the potential for the repeat
of the patterns is collapsing.

00:23:13.050 --> 00:23:16.050 align:middle line:10%
It's becoming closer
and closer and closer,

00:23:16.050 --> 00:23:19.020 align:middle line:10%
until we reach the year 2016.

00:23:19.020 --> 00:23:24.780 align:middle line:10%
2016 was the opportunity
for all of these cycles

00:23:24.780 --> 00:23:27.590 align:middle line:10%
previous to reoccur again.

00:23:27.590 --> 00:23:30.130 align:middle line:84%
And the question is,
what is the big deal?

00:23:30.130 --> 00:23:32.730 align:middle line:90%
What is significant about 2016?

00:23:32.730 --> 00:23:34.500 align:middle line:84%
Well, to explain that,
I'm going to have

00:23:34.500 --> 00:23:38.640 align:middle line:84%
to go back in time just a
little bit just for a moment.

00:23:38.640 --> 00:23:40.200 align:middle line:84%
If you remember
the conversations

00:23:40.200 --> 00:23:43.740 align:middle line:84%
about the Mayan calendar
and the descriptions

00:23:43.740 --> 00:23:47.250 align:middle line:84%
that I shared in season
one of the Mayan calendar,

00:23:47.250 --> 00:23:49.260 align:middle line:84%
Mayan calendar is the
most accurate system

00:23:49.260 --> 00:23:52.840 align:middle line:84%
of timekeeping known to exist
before the 20th century.

00:23:52.840 --> 00:23:54.510 align:middle line:84%
And it is the most
accurate, even

00:23:54.510 --> 00:23:56.790 align:middle line:84%
in the 20th century,
for predicting

00:23:56.790 --> 00:23:59.750 align:middle line:84%
massive cosmic
cycles, cycles that

00:23:59.750 --> 00:24:01.320 align:middle line:84%
go beyond simply
what's happening

00:24:01.320 --> 00:24:03.109 align:middle line:90%
in our everyday world.

00:24:03.109 --> 00:24:04.650 align:middle line:84%
The Mayan calendar
told us that there

00:24:04.650 --> 00:24:09.780 align:middle line:84%
have been four cycles in the
past, each cycle of 5,125

00:24:09.780 --> 00:24:12.300 align:middle line:84%
years, and that we
have just completed

00:24:12.300 --> 00:24:16.440 align:middle line:84%
the fifth and the final cycle
in that series of cycles.

00:24:16.440 --> 00:24:20.040 align:middle line:84%
So together, those five
cycles of 5,125 years,

00:24:20.040 --> 00:24:23.730 align:middle line:84%
they're telling us about
a 26,000-year cycle called

00:24:23.730 --> 00:24:27.980 align:middle line:90%
the precession of the equinoxes.

00:24:27.980 --> 00:24:32.030 align:middle line:84%
Those cycles ended
on December 12, 2012.

00:24:32.030 --> 00:24:34.760 align:middle line:84%
And this was the significance
of that particular date.

00:24:34.760 --> 00:24:37.640 align:middle line:84%
That was the solar
significance of that date.

00:24:37.640 --> 00:24:40.220 align:middle line:84%
However, the
mathematicians tell us--

00:24:40.220 --> 00:24:42.710 align:middle line:84%
and the Mayans
themselves tell us--

00:24:42.710 --> 00:24:46.220 align:middle line:84%
that there is a
buffer of time that

00:24:46.220 --> 00:24:47.870 align:middle line:90%
overlaps the end of the cycle.

00:24:47.870 --> 00:24:49.550 align:middle line:84%
The cycle doesn't
end in a moment.

00:24:49.550 --> 00:24:52.310 align:middle line:84%
The world doesn't stop
and change in a moment.

00:24:52.310 --> 00:24:54.500 align:middle line:90%
It's a slow, gradual change.

00:24:54.500 --> 00:24:57.610 align:middle line:84%
It's a buffer that
lasts for 36 years.

00:24:57.610 --> 00:25:01.520 align:middle line:84%
And our 36-year-long
buffer began in 1980,

00:25:01.520 --> 00:25:04.550 align:middle line:90%
ended in the year 2016.

00:25:04.550 --> 00:25:07.520 align:middle line:84%
So what that means is
that the events that

00:25:07.520 --> 00:25:11.570 align:middle line:84%
are happening within that cycle,
all of the previous events

00:25:11.570 --> 00:25:14.420 align:middle line:84%
that have been potential,
as we get closer

00:25:14.420 --> 00:25:16.340 align:middle line:84%
and closer to the
end of the cycle,

00:25:16.340 --> 00:25:19.685 align:middle line:84%
the time between
one event happening

00:25:19.685 --> 00:25:21.560 align:middle line:84%
and the completion of
that event and the next

00:25:21.560 --> 00:25:26.720 align:middle line:84%
collapses into what we
call a simultaneous event.

00:25:26.720 --> 00:25:31.250 align:middle line:84%
What that means is that the
year 2016 was the year when

00:25:31.250 --> 00:25:34.700 align:middle line:84%
all of the seeds for all
of the frightening things

00:25:34.700 --> 00:25:37.610 align:middle line:84%
could have happened-- for
global war, for the pandemic,

00:25:37.610 --> 00:25:39.500 align:middle line:90%
for economic collapse.

00:25:39.500 --> 00:25:42.140 align:middle line:84%
If you remember earlier
in this episode,

00:25:42.140 --> 00:25:44.780 align:middle line:84%
I talked to you about the
significance of the space

00:25:44.780 --> 00:25:46.130 align:middle line:90%
between the cycles.

00:25:46.130 --> 00:25:49.180 align:middle line:84%
When one cycle ends,
before the next one begins,

00:25:49.180 --> 00:25:52.280 align:middle line:84%
there is a space in between
that's called the choice point.

00:25:52.280 --> 00:25:53.600 align:middle line:90%
It's true for personal cycles.

00:25:53.600 --> 00:25:55.850 align:middle line:84%
And we're going to talk about
that in another episode.

00:25:55.850 --> 00:25:57.780 align:middle line:90%
It's true for global cycles.

00:25:57.780 --> 00:26:01.430 align:middle line:84%
And what that says
to us is that 2016,

00:26:01.430 --> 00:26:04.970 align:middle line:84%
at the end of that buffer, we
were in that period of a choice

00:26:04.970 --> 00:26:05.810 align:middle line:90%
point.

00:26:05.810 --> 00:26:11.690 align:middle line:84%
Not only was 2016 the
opportunity for the most

00:26:11.690 --> 00:26:14.150 align:middle line:84%
frightening of the
cycles to repeat,

00:26:14.150 --> 00:26:17.450 align:middle line:84%
it is also the opportunity--
the greatest opportunity--

00:26:17.450 --> 00:26:19.220 align:middle line:90%
for peace in our world.

00:26:19.220 --> 00:26:22.900 align:middle line:84%
It's the greatest opportunity
for economic abundance.

00:26:22.900 --> 00:26:25.700 align:middle line:84%
It's the greatest
opportunity to transcend

00:26:25.700 --> 00:26:27.160 align:middle line:90%
all the cycles in the past.

00:26:27.160 --> 00:26:29.150 align:middle line:84%
And what does that
mean to us today?

00:26:29.150 --> 00:26:31.100 align:middle line:84%
We're only two years
past that 2016.

00:26:31.100 --> 00:26:35.480 align:middle line:84%
We're still statistically
within the margin of time

00:26:35.480 --> 00:26:37.980 align:middle line:84%
when all of those things
apply in our lives.

00:26:37.980 --> 00:26:39.830 align:middle line:84%
And this is what I
wanted to say to you.

00:26:39.830 --> 00:26:42.440 align:middle line:84%
The cycles of time,
they are real.

00:26:42.440 --> 00:26:45.065 align:middle line:84%
They begin with a seed that
sets into motion a pattern

00:26:45.065 --> 00:26:47.870 align:middle line:84%
that repeats until something
changes that cycle.

00:26:47.870 --> 00:26:51.770 align:middle line:84%
You and I are living this
rare, precious moment

00:26:51.770 --> 00:26:54.835 align:middle line:84%
in the history of our world and
the history of our civilization

00:26:54.835 --> 00:26:56.500 align:middle line:90%
and the history of our lives.

00:26:56.500 --> 00:26:58.910 align:middle line:84%
So just to be very clear
on what I've said--

00:26:58.910 --> 00:27:01.800 align:middle line:84%
because I know we have just
covered a lot of information,

00:27:01.800 --> 00:27:03.320 align:middle line:90%
a lot of material--

00:27:03.320 --> 00:27:07.010 align:middle line:84%
you and I are living
the greatest opportunity

00:27:07.010 --> 00:27:09.080 align:middle line:84%
for peace, the
greatest opportunity

00:27:09.080 --> 00:27:11.540 align:middle line:84%
to bring about positive
change in this world,

00:27:11.540 --> 00:27:13.250 align:middle line:84%
in the most
meaningful way that we

00:27:13.250 --> 00:27:17.960 align:middle line:84%
have seen in 5,000 years
of recorded human history.

00:27:17.960 --> 00:27:20.000 align:middle line:84%
The same time
cycles that play out

00:27:20.000 --> 00:27:22.700 align:middle line:84%
on the big scale of
the world also direct

00:27:22.700 --> 00:27:26.360 align:middle line:84%
the turning points of change for
our lives on a smaller scale.

00:27:26.360 --> 00:27:28.610 align:middle line:84%
In the next episode,
we'll discover

00:27:28.610 --> 00:27:32.000 align:middle line:84%
how to calculate the optimum
time for healthy change

00:27:32.000 --> 00:27:34.515 align:middle line:84%
in our personal patterns
of fractal time.

00:27:34.515 --> 00:27:37.250 align:middle line:84%
So I want to thank you for
joining me for today's program.
