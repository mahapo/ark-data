00:00:25.150 --> 00:00:27.100 align:middle line:10%
>> If you're watching
this program today,

00:00:27.100 --> 00:00:30.775 align:middle line:10%
then you've probably seen the
many episodes of Missing Links.

00:00:30.775 --> 00:00:34.300 align:middle line:84%
But what you haven't seen
is all of the information

00:00:34.300 --> 00:00:36.820 align:middle line:84%
that I had to sift
through in order

00:00:36.820 --> 00:00:40.750 align:middle line:84%
to reach the point where I
created the episodes that

00:00:40.750 --> 00:00:41.787 align:middle line:90%
have become this series.

00:00:41.787 --> 00:00:43.870 align:middle line:84%
And that's what I want to
talk to you about today,

00:00:43.870 --> 00:00:47.980 align:middle line:84%
because there are facets of
this information that I think

00:00:47.980 --> 00:00:50.230 align:middle line:84%
are critical, they simply
didn't make it into the mix

00:00:50.230 --> 00:00:51.970 align:middle line:84%
when we're putting
the program together.

00:00:51.970 --> 00:00:53.944 align:middle line:90%
Education is one of those.

00:00:53.944 --> 00:00:55.360 align:middle line:84%
People all over
the world, they're

00:00:55.360 --> 00:00:58.270 align:middle line:84%
asking me about education
in one form or another,

00:00:58.270 --> 00:01:00.534 align:middle line:84%
and it means different
things to different people.

00:01:00.534 --> 00:01:02.200 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes they're
asking for themselves,

00:01:02.200 --> 00:01:04.840 align:middle line:84%
sometimes they're asking
for their children.

00:01:04.840 --> 00:01:07.000 align:middle line:90%
I'm passionate about this topic.

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:10.360 align:middle line:84%
And that's why I do want
to address it today,

00:01:10.360 --> 00:01:15.040 align:middle line:84%
because ultimately education
is the key to solving

00:01:15.040 --> 00:01:17.800 align:middle line:84%
every problem that I've
mentioned in Missing Links,

00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:21.310 align:middle line:84%
and every problem we could
ever have in our lives.

00:01:21.310 --> 00:01:24.610 align:middle line:84%
The theme of Missing
Links, ultimately,

00:01:24.610 --> 00:01:27.370 align:middle line:84%
was the answer to a question
that I asked earlier

00:01:27.370 --> 00:01:29.170 align:middle line:90%
in the program, who are we?

00:01:29.170 --> 00:01:30.340 align:middle line:90%
Who am I as an individual?

00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:32.920 align:middle line:90%
Who are we collectively?

00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:36.370 align:middle line:84%
Our answer to that question is
the result of our education.

00:01:36.370 --> 00:01:39.790 align:middle line:84%
It's what we have been
taught to believe and accept

00:01:39.790 --> 00:01:41.210 align:middle line:90%
about ourselves.

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:42.960 align:middle line:84%
The teaching sometimes
happens in schools,

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:45.580 align:middle line:84%
but interestingly, a lot of
it happens when we're nowhere

00:01:45.580 --> 00:01:47.650 align:middle line:90%
near an academic situation.

00:01:47.650 --> 00:01:50.080 align:middle line:84%
It comes from our
families, from our friends,

00:01:50.080 --> 00:01:51.850 align:middle line:84%
from our neighbors,
from our society,

00:01:51.850 --> 00:01:54.310 align:middle line:84%
from our churches, our
synagogues, our religious

00:01:54.310 --> 00:01:55.690 align:middle line:90%
teachings.

00:01:55.690 --> 00:01:59.830 align:middle line:84%
And a lot of this
education is subconscious.

00:01:59.830 --> 00:02:02.914 align:middle line:84%
It comes from the subtle
cues that we pick up

00:02:02.914 --> 00:02:04.330 align:middle line:84%
from other people
and the way they

00:02:04.330 --> 00:02:06.450 align:middle line:84%
respond to their
life's challenges.

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:09.550 align:middle line:84%
What happens when they're
diagnosed with a disease,

00:02:09.550 --> 00:02:11.310 align:middle line:84%
how do they go
about healing that?

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:13.720 align:middle line:84%
What happens when the
family begins to break down,

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:15.940 align:middle line:84%
how do you go
about healing that?

00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:19.180 align:middle line:84%
These subtle cues
all come into play

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:22.900 align:middle line:84%
when we answer this question,
who am I and who are we?

00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:25.780 align:middle line:84%
So the reason I think
this is so important

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:28.660 align:middle line:84%
is because we have been
steeped in a story.

00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:32.660 align:middle line:84%
You and I, we're
part of a population,

00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:33.910 align:middle line:90%
we're part of a global family.

00:02:33.910 --> 00:02:37.720 align:middle line:84%
We've been steeped in this
story for over 300 years,

00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:39.430 align:middle line:84%
a scientific story
that we now know

00:02:39.430 --> 00:02:44.020 align:middle line:84%
is not true that tells us that
we are based in separation

00:02:44.020 --> 00:02:45.730 align:middle line:84%
and that competition
and conflict is

00:02:45.730 --> 00:02:48.647 align:middle line:84%
the fundamental rule of
nature, and that that's

00:02:48.647 --> 00:02:50.230 align:middle line:84%
the way that we
should live our lives,

00:02:50.230 --> 00:02:52.680 align:middle line:84%
and that's the way we should
go about solving our problems.

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:55.013 align:middle line:84%
I'm not saying we talk about
this at the breakfast table

00:02:55.013 --> 00:02:56.830 align:middle line:84%
every morning, or that
it's a common thing

00:02:56.830 --> 00:02:59.320 align:middle line:84%
to talk about at the drinking
fountain in the office

00:02:59.320 --> 00:03:03.030 align:middle line:84%
during a break at work,
but it is subconscious.

00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:05.870 align:middle line:84%
And if you think that this
is not a part of your life,

00:03:05.870 --> 00:03:07.750 align:middle line:84%
some of my most
spiritual friends,

00:03:07.750 --> 00:03:10.780 align:middle line:84%
people that say they're the most
spiritual people on the planet,

00:03:10.780 --> 00:03:12.580 align:middle line:90%
I say, oh yeah?

00:03:12.580 --> 00:03:13.690 align:middle line:90%
Tell me about this.

00:03:13.690 --> 00:03:17.290 align:middle line:84%
When you are in the
privacy of your own home

00:03:17.290 --> 00:03:19.450 align:middle line:84%
with those that know you
the best, in the most

00:03:19.450 --> 00:03:21.430 align:middle line:84%
intimate moments of
your life and somebody

00:03:21.430 --> 00:03:24.950 align:middle line:84%
pushes your button,
how do you respond?

00:03:24.950 --> 00:03:27.330 align:middle line:84%
Do you respond in a loving,
compassionate manner,

00:03:27.330 --> 00:03:29.230 align:middle line:84%
or when that button
is pushed, do

00:03:29.230 --> 00:03:32.750 align:middle line:84%
you lash out with hurtful
words and hurtful tactics

00:03:32.750 --> 00:03:34.840 align:middle line:90%
in primal survival?

00:03:34.840 --> 00:03:37.930 align:middle line:84%
Because that's how deeply
these ideas of competition

00:03:37.930 --> 00:03:40.092 align:middle line:84%
and conflict have been
programmed into us.

00:03:40.092 --> 00:03:41.550 align:middle line:84%
And when people
are honest with me,

00:03:41.550 --> 00:03:43.591 align:middle line:84%
they say, my god, I never
thought of it that way.

00:03:43.591 --> 00:03:47.530 align:middle line:84%
But they say, yes, when
I'm up against the wall,

00:03:47.530 --> 00:03:49.210 align:middle line:84%
I go to the lowest
common denominator,

00:03:49.210 --> 00:03:52.420 align:middle line:84%
and I say hurtful things I'm
often sorry about afterwards.

00:03:52.420 --> 00:03:54.979 align:middle line:84%
Today it even happens when
we're writing e-mails and texts.

00:03:54.979 --> 00:03:56.520 align:middle line:84%
We push that button
when we're angry,

00:03:56.520 --> 00:03:59.170 align:middle line:84%
we say, oh man, I wish
I hadn't have sent that.

00:03:59.170 --> 00:04:02.230 align:middle line:84%
So maybe these are
silly examples,

00:04:02.230 --> 00:04:07.300 align:middle line:84%
they speak to the point of how
deeply this conditioning runs.

00:04:07.300 --> 00:04:09.430 align:middle line:84%
So the reason I'm so
passionate about this

00:04:09.430 --> 00:04:13.480 align:middle line:84%
is that we have an
opportunity now to redefine

00:04:13.480 --> 00:04:14.830 align:middle line:90%
the way we think of ourselves.

00:04:14.830 --> 00:04:18.040 align:middle line:84%
And it's important for
our young generation.

00:04:18.040 --> 00:04:22.416 align:middle line:84%
Any solution that we apply
to any of the problems

00:04:22.416 --> 00:04:24.040 align:middle line:84%
that I've talked
about in Missing Links

00:04:24.040 --> 00:04:25.706 align:middle line:84%
or that you're having
in your life right

00:04:25.706 --> 00:04:29.560 align:middle line:84%
now, any solution
is only a Band-Aid,

00:04:29.560 --> 00:04:32.930 align:middle line:84%
it can only be
temporary until we shift

00:04:32.930 --> 00:04:37.300 align:middle line:84%
the fundamental thinking
of how we see ourselves,

00:04:37.300 --> 00:04:41.020 align:middle line:84%
how we see life in
general, and how we see

00:04:41.020 --> 00:04:43.240 align:middle line:90%
our relationship to the world.

00:04:43.240 --> 00:04:44.770 align:middle line:84%
So many people say,
well, you know,

00:04:44.770 --> 00:04:47.247 align:middle line:84%
this is an interesting
philosophical question.

00:04:47.247 --> 00:04:49.330 align:middle line:84%
I want to tell you, it
goes way beyond philosophy.

00:04:49.330 --> 00:04:52.722 align:middle line:84%
It touches every
moment of our lives.

00:04:52.722 --> 00:04:54.430 align:middle line:84%
For example, let me
just talk about this.

00:04:54.430 --> 00:04:56.507 align:middle line:84%
Those of you have
young people, you

00:04:56.507 --> 00:04:58.090 align:middle line:84%
have young people
in school right now,

00:04:58.090 --> 00:05:02.200 align:middle line:84%
they are exposed to technology
that you and I didn't have,

00:05:02.200 --> 00:05:04.870 align:middle line:84%
the internet, and
texting, and emails.

00:05:04.870 --> 00:05:08.070 align:middle line:84%
They're exposed to
bullying, a new phenomenon,

00:05:08.070 --> 00:05:10.990 align:middle line:84%
cyberbullying that's
happening right now where

00:05:10.990 --> 00:05:14.350 align:middle line:84%
their peers will say things to
them, or take pictures of them,

00:05:14.350 --> 00:05:17.110 align:middle line:84%
or make fun of them in ways
that we used to do just verbally

00:05:17.110 --> 00:05:18.380 align:middle line:90%
in the hallway to one another.

00:05:18.380 --> 00:05:19.963 align:middle line:84%
Now you spread it
across the internet,

00:05:19.963 --> 00:05:21.730 align:middle line:90%
and everyone is seeing it.

00:05:21.730 --> 00:05:25.850 align:middle line:84%
To a young person
who has been steeped

00:05:25.850 --> 00:05:29.390 align:middle line:84%
in the current ideas of
separation, competition,

00:05:29.390 --> 00:05:33.290 align:middle line:84%
conflict, and the idea that life
itself has very little value,

00:05:33.290 --> 00:05:37.550 align:middle line:84%
that life is the result of
this accident of evolution,

00:05:37.550 --> 00:05:39.380 align:middle line:84%
there's no
intentionality involved.

00:05:39.380 --> 00:05:42.710 align:middle line:84%
To a young person like
that, that criticism,

00:05:42.710 --> 00:05:45.140 align:middle line:84%
they take it to heart,
and they believe what

00:05:45.140 --> 00:05:46.490 align:middle line:90%
they're told on the one hand.

00:05:46.490 --> 00:05:48.320 align:middle line:84%
On the other hand,
the young person

00:05:48.320 --> 00:05:52.430 align:middle line:84%
who has been blessed to be in
a family that has conditioned

00:05:52.430 --> 00:05:57.110 align:middle line:84%
them, taught them rock solid
values about how precious

00:05:57.110 --> 00:06:02.000 align:middle line:84%
life is, about how powerful they
are, about how connected they

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:03.590 align:middle line:84%
are to themselves,
to other people,

00:06:03.590 --> 00:06:05.480 align:middle line:90%
to nature, to their own bodies.

00:06:05.480 --> 00:06:08.330 align:middle line:84%
When they hear those criticisms,
it rolls off of them,

00:06:08.330 --> 00:06:11.190 align:middle line:84%
because it doesn't
have the same meaning.

00:06:11.190 --> 00:06:14.390 align:middle line:84%
The way that we think
about life itself,

00:06:14.390 --> 00:06:18.070 align:middle line:84%
when we try to save a life,
and when we try to take a life.

00:06:18.070 --> 00:06:19.910 align:middle line:90%
I mean, this comes down to war.

00:06:19.910 --> 00:06:23.000 align:middle line:84%
When does a nation march
across the boundaries,

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:26.030 align:middle line:84%
the borders of another
nation with our armies?

00:06:26.030 --> 00:06:28.790 align:middle line:84%
When do we invade the
homes of other people?

00:06:28.790 --> 00:06:30.860 align:middle line:84%
When does a
corporation determine

00:06:30.860 --> 00:06:34.220 align:middle line:84%
how much is enough toxic
waste to dump into the ocean,

00:06:34.220 --> 00:06:36.940 align:middle line:84%
or how much radiation do we
pump into the atmosphere?

00:06:36.940 --> 00:06:38.690 align:middle line:10%
As different as they
are from one another,

00:06:38.690 --> 00:06:40.731 align:middle line:10%
every one of these things
that I'm talking about,

00:06:40.731 --> 00:06:44.540 align:middle line:10%
it all comes back to this
fundamental question, who am I,

00:06:44.540 --> 00:06:45.890 align:middle line:10%
who are we?

00:06:45.890 --> 00:06:50.180 align:middle line:10%
Because when we truly
embrace the deepest truths

00:06:50.180 --> 00:06:54.440 align:middle line:10%
of our existence, the ways
that we have lived our lives

00:06:54.440 --> 00:06:57.980 align:middle line:10%
and treated one another in
the past simply make no sense.

00:06:57.980 --> 00:07:02.510 align:middle line:84%
And they have no context
for that new information

00:07:02.510 --> 00:07:04.910 align:middle line:84%
and the way that
it is showing us

00:07:04.910 --> 00:07:07.799 align:middle line:84%
about our value and our
relationship to life.

00:07:07.799 --> 00:07:09.590 align:middle line:84%
So we have this
opportunity right now, this

00:07:09.590 --> 00:07:11.900 align:middle line:84%
is why I'm passionate
about education.

00:07:11.900 --> 00:07:14.540 align:middle line:84%
Band-aids are good, and
we need some band-aids

00:07:14.540 --> 00:07:17.300 align:middle line:84%
to address many of the problems
we have in the world today.

00:07:17.300 --> 00:07:19.850 align:middle line:84%
Ultimately, we have
this opportunity

00:07:19.850 --> 00:07:23.000 align:middle line:84%
in a time where the globe
is moving toward war

00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:24.650 align:middle line:84%
and war's being
glamorized and made

00:07:24.650 --> 00:07:27.920 align:middle line:84%
to look fun like a video
game on television,

00:07:27.920 --> 00:07:29.890 align:middle line:84%
and young people
are enticed by that.

00:07:29.890 --> 00:07:33.320 align:middle line:84%
We have this
opportunity to raise

00:07:33.320 --> 00:07:37.710 align:middle line:84%
an entire generation of young
people based on these new--

00:07:37.710 --> 00:07:39.350 align:middle line:84%
well, they're
ancient, but they're

00:07:39.350 --> 00:07:43.520 align:middle line:84%
newly recognized-- deep
truths, and instill within them

00:07:43.520 --> 00:07:48.380 align:middle line:84%
the value of life, their
own personal self worth.

00:07:48.380 --> 00:07:50.630 align:middle line:84%
How precious life is, and
the fact that although we

00:07:50.630 --> 00:07:53.810 align:middle line:84%
don't understand fully
how it has come to pass,

00:07:53.810 --> 00:07:54.770 align:middle line:90%
life is no accident.

00:07:54.770 --> 00:07:57.500 align:middle line:84%
There is an intentionality
underlying our existence,

00:07:57.500 --> 00:08:00.270 align:middle line:84%
and that we are given rare,
precious abilities given

00:08:00.270 --> 00:08:02.120 align:middle line:90%
to no other form of life.

00:08:02.120 --> 00:08:04.880 align:middle line:84%
Empathy, intuition, access
to the subconscious,

00:08:04.880 --> 00:08:07.550 align:middle line:84%
direct access to
self-healing, the opportunity

00:08:07.550 --> 00:08:10.340 align:middle line:84%
to create resilience to
life, and much, much more.

00:08:10.340 --> 00:08:13.090 align:middle line:84%
All of that belongs in
no other form of life.

00:08:13.090 --> 00:08:15.980 align:middle line:84%
When we instill these
values in a young person

00:08:15.980 --> 00:08:19.760 align:middle line:84%
and they say, my god,
I'm a powerful being,

00:08:19.760 --> 00:08:21.890 align:middle line:84%
and I'm responsible
with my power,

00:08:21.890 --> 00:08:23.690 align:middle line:84%
and I am part of the
world that I see,

00:08:23.690 --> 00:08:25.470 align:middle line:90%
I'm not separate from it.

00:08:25.470 --> 00:08:27.800 align:middle line:84%
And I can make
this a better world

00:08:27.800 --> 00:08:30.560 align:middle line:84%
through the way
that I make myself.

00:08:30.560 --> 00:08:33.169 align:middle line:84%
When we begin to instill
those kinds of values,

00:08:33.169 --> 00:08:36.890 align:middle line:84%
the world changes that's not a
Band-Aid, that is a sea change.

00:08:36.890 --> 00:08:39.417 align:middle line:84%
That is a fundamental
shift in thinking.

00:08:39.417 --> 00:08:41.000 align:middle line:84%
We've never seen
this before, and this

00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:44.510 align:middle line:84%
is the opportunity we have now,
the sweet spot of where we are.

00:08:44.510 --> 00:08:47.190 align:middle line:84%
The technologies available
to spread the word,

00:08:47.190 --> 00:08:49.580 align:middle line:84%
now we have the
opportunity to bring

00:08:49.580 --> 00:08:52.670 align:middle line:84%
honest, truthful,
factual information,

00:08:52.670 --> 00:08:55.760 align:middle line:84%
rock solid science that
tells us everything

00:08:55.760 --> 00:08:57.860 align:middle line:84%
I'm saying to you
now, that tells us

00:08:57.860 --> 00:09:00.050 align:middle line:84%
how true these things
are in our lives.

00:09:00.050 --> 00:09:02.300 align:middle line:84%
Be honest with our young
people, share with them what

00:09:02.300 --> 00:09:04.760 align:middle line:84%
we've found to be
true, and allow them--

00:09:04.760 --> 00:09:06.020 align:middle line:90%
they're very smart--

00:09:06.020 --> 00:09:09.220 align:middle line:84%
allow them to reflect on what
that means in their own lives,

00:09:09.220 --> 00:09:10.730 align:middle line:90%
and to live their own truths.

00:09:10.730 --> 00:09:12.271 align:middle line:84%
That's where we see
the world change.

00:09:12.271 --> 00:09:14.930 align:middle line:90%


00:09:14.930 --> 00:09:18.770 align:middle line:84%
Without a doubt, every event
that I do in a live public

00:09:18.770 --> 00:09:22.715 align:middle line:84%
forum, every time I do an
online broadcast, a webinar,

00:09:22.715 --> 00:09:27.270 align:middle line:84%
an interactive session with
people anywhere in the world--

00:09:27.270 --> 00:09:30.470 align:middle line:84%
not just in the United States,
not just in the Western world,

00:09:30.470 --> 00:09:34.400 align:middle line:84%
Asia, Africa, South America,
Australia, everywhere--

00:09:34.400 --> 00:09:37.229 align:middle line:84%
people say, where do
we get our information?

00:09:37.229 --> 00:09:38.270 align:middle line:90%
Where do we get our news?

00:09:38.270 --> 00:09:41.930 align:middle line:84%
What's a good source of
news and information?

00:09:41.930 --> 00:09:45.680 align:middle line:84%
That's a good question,
and the answer that I give

00:09:45.680 --> 00:09:48.320 align:middle line:84%
is often not the answer
that people are expecting,

00:09:48.320 --> 00:09:50.180 align:middle line:84%
because they're
expecting me to give them

00:09:50.180 --> 00:09:54.500 align:middle line:84%
an internet URL, a link,
or a station to dial.

00:09:54.500 --> 00:09:57.120 align:middle line:84%
The truth is that the internet
is a double edged sword.

00:09:57.120 --> 00:09:58.620 align:middle line:84%
I worked in the
industry when it was

00:09:58.620 --> 00:10:00.180 align:middle line:84%
being developed
at Cisco Systems,

00:10:00.180 --> 00:10:02.210 align:middle line:90%
and we talked about this a lot.

00:10:02.210 --> 00:10:06.860 align:middle line:84%
When we open up an avenue, a
highway, a superhighway that

00:10:06.860 --> 00:10:09.410 align:middle line:84%
allows information to
be shared, on the one

00:10:09.410 --> 00:10:12.170 align:middle line:84%
hand it means just that,
information can be shared

00:10:12.170 --> 00:10:14.990 align:middle line:84%
from anyone, and you all
know there's a lot of stuff

00:10:14.990 --> 00:10:18.080 align:middle line:84%
out there, we see it, it shows
up in our inbox every day.

00:10:18.080 --> 00:10:21.440 align:middle line:84%
Some of it's true, some of it's
partially true, some of it's

00:10:21.440 --> 00:10:24.650 align:middle line:84%
what my friends call half-baked
truth, and some of it

00:10:24.650 --> 00:10:27.210 align:middle line:90%
is absolutely not true at all.

00:10:27.210 --> 00:10:28.460 align:middle line:90%
How do we discern that?

00:10:28.460 --> 00:10:29.840 align:middle line:90%
It takes a lot of work.

00:10:29.840 --> 00:10:31.580 align:middle line:84%
Due diligence is
what I have to say.

00:10:31.580 --> 00:10:35.979 align:middle line:84%
You've got to seek out the
information that you're

00:10:35.979 --> 00:10:37.520 align:middle line:84%
going to apply in
your life, and that

00:10:37.520 --> 00:10:40.170 align:middle line:84%
makes your discoveries
meaningful to you

00:10:40.170 --> 00:10:40.970 align:middle line:90%
and your life.

00:10:40.970 --> 00:10:44.090 align:middle line:84%
And that means going
to multiple sources

00:10:44.090 --> 00:10:46.520 align:middle line:84%
and looking at what's called
peer-reviewed science,

00:10:46.520 --> 00:10:48.920 align:middle line:84%
and I talked about this a
little bit in Missing Links,

00:10:48.920 --> 00:10:51.680 align:middle line:90%
let me just mention that here.

00:10:51.680 --> 00:10:54.290 align:middle line:84%
Because anyone can
publish anything

00:10:54.290 --> 00:10:58.700 align:middle line:84%
on the internet, that is the
reason it becomes especially

00:10:58.700 --> 00:11:00.650 align:middle line:84%
important to look
at the credibility,

00:11:00.650 --> 00:11:02.780 align:middle line:84%
where does that
information come from?

00:11:02.780 --> 00:11:03.750 align:middle line:90%
It's tricky.

00:11:03.750 --> 00:11:06.504 align:middle line:84%
So we have to be really
careful when we see where

00:11:06.504 --> 00:11:07.670 align:middle line:90%
this information comes from.

00:11:07.670 --> 00:11:11.400 align:middle line:84%
Peer reviewed science,
on the other hand,

00:11:11.400 --> 00:11:14.630 align:middle line:84%
is science where an individual
or group of individuals

00:11:14.630 --> 00:11:16.910 align:middle line:84%
will come together,
they will write a paper

00:11:16.910 --> 00:11:18.896 align:middle line:90%
in a very specific format.

00:11:18.896 --> 00:11:20.270 align:middle line:10%
They'll have an
abstract, they'll

00:11:20.270 --> 00:11:23.150 align:middle line:10%
have a theory, a
hypothesis, they'll

00:11:23.150 --> 00:11:26.860 align:middle line:10%
have their methods of research,
they'll have some conclusions,

00:11:26.860 --> 00:11:28.280 align:middle line:10%
they'll have references.

00:11:28.280 --> 00:11:32.450 align:middle line:84%
They will have circulated
that within their peer group--

00:11:32.450 --> 00:11:34.700 align:middle line:84%
hence the term peer
reviewed science--

00:11:34.700 --> 00:11:35.640 align:middle line:90%
and it can take years.

00:11:35.640 --> 00:11:38.030 align:middle line:10%
It can take six, seven,
eight years for a paper

00:11:38.030 --> 00:11:39.860 align:middle line:10%
to move through that
peer review process

00:11:39.860 --> 00:11:42.334 align:middle line:10%
where other scientists will
look at it, and they'll say,

00:11:42.334 --> 00:11:44.000 align:middle line:10%
well, this is right
on, and they'll say,

00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:46.906 align:middle line:10%
this is totally wrong, and
they'll shoot holes in it.

00:11:46.906 --> 00:11:48.530 align:middle line:10%
So that the people
that wrote the paper

00:11:48.530 --> 00:11:51.506 align:middle line:10%
can go back, and
research, and amend what

00:11:51.506 --> 00:11:52.880 align:middle line:10%
it is that doesn't
work, and then

00:11:52.880 --> 00:11:55.940 align:middle line:10%
they publish in the journal,
like the journal Nature

00:11:55.940 --> 00:11:58.730 align:middle line:10%
that you can find in
your airport bookstore,

00:11:58.730 --> 00:12:00.590 align:middle line:10%
or the journal Science.

00:12:00.590 --> 00:12:02.164 align:middle line:10%
Very accessible.

00:12:02.164 --> 00:12:03.830 align:middle line:10%
They're not technical,
but they are peer

00:12:03.830 --> 00:12:05.420 align:middle line:10%
reviewed scientific papers.

00:12:05.420 --> 00:12:08.900 align:middle line:10%
When you see those, doesn't
guarantee they're 100%,

00:12:08.900 --> 00:12:12.710 align:middle line:10%
but it says the odds are really
good that what you're seeing

00:12:12.710 --> 00:12:15.140 align:middle line:10%
is what is known to be true
in that moment in time.

00:12:15.140 --> 00:12:17.150 align:middle line:84%
It might change with
the next research paper,

00:12:17.150 --> 00:12:18.249 align:middle line:90%
at that moment in time.

00:12:18.249 --> 00:12:20.540 align:middle line:84%
So I'm going to invite you,
look at the source of where

00:12:20.540 --> 00:12:21.800 align:middle line:90%
your information comes from.

00:12:21.800 --> 00:12:25.160 align:middle line:84%
See if they are credible, see
if they are peer reviewed,

00:12:25.160 --> 00:12:27.760 align:middle line:84%
and see if it's a
circular reference or not.

00:12:27.760 --> 00:12:30.480 align:middle line:84%
Or maybe it's coming from
a lot of different places.

00:12:30.480 --> 00:12:31.490 align:middle line:90%
So this is important.

00:12:31.490 --> 00:12:37.160 align:middle line:84%
Because we form our opinions,
we solve our problems.

00:12:37.160 --> 00:12:39.000 align:middle line:90%
We teach our children.

00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:40.490 align:middle line:90%
We live our lives.

00:12:40.490 --> 00:12:46.520 align:middle line:84%
We elect the representatives
that implement the laws

00:12:46.520 --> 00:12:49.550 align:middle line:84%
and the policies that
govern our lives based

00:12:49.550 --> 00:12:51.680 align:middle line:84%
on the way we answer the
question, who are we,

00:12:51.680 --> 00:12:53.750 align:middle line:84%
and way we think
about ourselves.

00:12:53.750 --> 00:12:56.390 align:middle line:10%
So all of a sudden, where
we get our information,

00:12:56.390 --> 00:12:58.340 align:middle line:10%
it's more than just
an interesting topic

00:12:58.340 --> 00:13:01.940 align:middle line:10%
of conversation, it's
vital for us and the way

00:13:01.940 --> 00:13:02.780 align:middle line:10%
we live our lives.

00:13:02.780 --> 00:13:05.350 align:middle line:90%


00:13:05.350 --> 00:13:08.690 align:middle line:84%
When we talk about
education, the academic side

00:13:08.690 --> 00:13:10.370 align:middle line:84%
is very obvious,
but I think what's

00:13:10.370 --> 00:13:13.296 align:middle line:84%
even more fundamental
is parenting.

00:13:13.296 --> 00:13:15.170 align:middle line:84%
Because this is really
where education begins

00:13:15.170 --> 00:13:16.961 align:middle line:84%
with our young people,
before they are ever

00:13:16.961 --> 00:13:22.830 align:middle line:84%
exposed to a formal education
with other children their age,

00:13:22.830 --> 00:13:26.280 align:middle line:84%
they begin to learn from
us, we are their parents.

00:13:26.280 --> 00:13:29.180 align:middle line:84%
So I think this is
fundamentally where

00:13:29.180 --> 00:13:31.505 align:middle line:90%
the educational process begins.

00:13:31.505 --> 00:13:33.380 align:middle line:84%
And the questions I'm
asking are about what's

00:13:33.380 --> 00:13:35.360 align:middle line:90%
called conscious parenting.

00:13:35.360 --> 00:13:37.400 align:middle line:84%
And what I found is
that the word conscious

00:13:37.400 --> 00:13:39.191 align:middle line:84%
means different things
to different people.

00:13:39.191 --> 00:13:41.900 align:middle line:84%
So I'm going to invite you
to take this and put it

00:13:41.900 --> 00:13:46.730 align:middle line:84%
in the language and interpret in
a way that's meaningful to you.

00:13:46.730 --> 00:13:50.600 align:middle line:84%
For me, conscious parenting
is all about awareness,

00:13:50.600 --> 00:13:55.970 align:middle line:84%
and sensitivity, and,
again, honesty, and truth.

00:13:55.970 --> 00:14:00.610 align:middle line:84%
Being aware of your
personal behavior

00:14:00.610 --> 00:14:02.150 align:middle line:84%
in the presence
of your children,

00:14:02.150 --> 00:14:05.240 align:middle line:84%
the language that you're
using, and this is a big one.

00:14:05.240 --> 00:14:07.910 align:middle line:84%
Because language is
more than just words.

00:14:07.910 --> 00:14:11.330 align:middle line:84%
Language is a program
to our subconscious.

00:14:11.330 --> 00:14:14.570 align:middle line:84%
And when we instill
values within young people

00:14:14.570 --> 00:14:18.750 align:middle line:84%
at an early age that we
live in a world of scarcity,

00:14:18.750 --> 00:14:23.480 align:middle line:84%
we live in a world of lack, it's
a dog-eat-dog world out there.

00:14:23.480 --> 00:14:25.430 align:middle line:84%
This is something
we've all heard.

00:14:25.430 --> 00:14:30.470 align:middle line:84%
That seemingly harmless comment
that we're making our children

00:14:30.470 --> 00:14:33.650 align:middle line:84%
again and again, it instills
with them values subconsciously

00:14:33.650 --> 00:14:35.690 align:middle line:84%
that show up as
lack in their lives.

00:14:35.690 --> 00:14:37.610 align:middle line:84%
As adults, these are the
ones that are asking,

00:14:37.610 --> 00:14:39.680 align:middle line:84%
why can't I find a
good relationship?

00:14:39.680 --> 00:14:42.620 align:middle line:84%
Why can't I find
abundance in my life, when

00:14:42.620 --> 00:14:44.780 align:middle line:84%
they have been
programmed subconsciously

00:14:44.780 --> 00:14:47.030 align:middle line:84%
and unintentionally
from the time

00:14:47.030 --> 00:14:50.420 align:middle line:84%
they're very young about
what a tough world this is.

00:14:50.420 --> 00:14:52.460 align:middle line:84%
Be aware of the
language that you're

00:14:52.460 --> 00:14:56.090 align:middle line:84%
using when you communicate
with other people,

00:14:56.090 --> 00:14:59.480 align:middle line:84%
with your children, and
what it says about yourself,

00:14:59.480 --> 00:15:01.550 align:middle line:84%
and the kinds of words
that you're using,

00:15:01.550 --> 00:15:05.330 align:middle line:90%
because nature is very literal.

00:15:05.330 --> 00:15:11.000 align:middle line:84%
So when we say things like, I
can't find a partner in life,

00:15:11.000 --> 00:15:13.700 align:middle line:90%
to us, we're making a comment.

00:15:13.700 --> 00:15:16.940 align:middle line:84%
But to the universe,
that is a command.

00:15:16.940 --> 00:15:19.861 align:middle line:84%
So the universe has just
heard an individual say,

00:15:19.861 --> 00:15:22.110 align:middle line:84%
I can't find a partner in
life, and the universe says,

00:15:22.110 --> 00:15:25.010 align:middle line:90%
OK, I can honor that command.

00:15:25.010 --> 00:15:28.430 align:middle line:84%
And so you can't find, and you
can't find, and you can't find.

00:15:28.430 --> 00:15:30.290 align:middle line:84%
Because there's no
resolution to that,

00:15:30.290 --> 00:15:33.080 align:middle line:84%
all the universe has heard
you say is, you can't find.

00:15:33.080 --> 00:15:35.900 align:middle line:84%
A more conscious way to
say something like that

00:15:35.900 --> 00:15:40.280 align:middle line:84%
would be that I choose to
find a partner in my life.

00:15:40.280 --> 00:15:43.700 align:middle line:84%
There is an amazing
resource, a man,

00:15:43.700 --> 00:15:46.220 align:middle line:84%
a dear brother, a dear
friend who I known and worked

00:15:46.220 --> 00:15:49.100 align:middle line:84%
with for years, his name
is Robert Tennyson Stevens,

00:15:49.100 --> 00:15:52.420 align:middle line:84%
who talks and has
written books about what

00:15:52.420 --> 00:15:54.486 align:middle line:90%
is called Conscious Languaging.

00:15:54.486 --> 00:15:57.110 align:middle line:84%
And if you have not checked out
Robert Tennyson Stephen's work,

00:15:57.110 --> 00:15:58.693 align:middle line:84%
I invite you to do
it, because I think

00:15:58.693 --> 00:16:02.480 align:middle line:84%
conscious languaging has to play
a role in conscious parenting.

00:16:02.480 --> 00:16:03.410 align:middle line:90%
It has to.

00:16:03.410 --> 00:16:05.870 align:middle line:84%
And that's where I'm
going with all of this.

00:16:05.870 --> 00:16:07.700 align:middle line:10%
What are we saying
to our young people,

00:16:07.700 --> 00:16:10.010 align:middle line:10%
and what are we
saying to ourselves?

00:16:10.010 --> 00:16:13.140 align:middle line:84%
Young people learn
by observation.

00:16:13.140 --> 00:16:15.000 align:middle line:84%
So the question is,
as you as a parent,

00:16:15.000 --> 00:16:16.730 align:middle line:90%
how do you solve your problems?

00:16:16.730 --> 00:16:19.160 align:middle line:84%
When you're confronted
with something that's

00:16:19.160 --> 00:16:22.640 align:middle line:84%
hurtful or difficult, or someone
says something to you that

00:16:22.640 --> 00:16:24.719 align:middle line:84%
can be hurtful or
difficult, or you're

00:16:24.719 --> 00:16:26.510 align:middle line:84%
confronted with something
that you've never

00:16:26.510 --> 00:16:28.960 align:middle line:84%
had to solve before, how
do you go about solving it?

00:16:28.960 --> 00:16:30.800 align:middle line:84%
Do you say, this can't
be done, or do you

00:16:30.800 --> 00:16:33.000 align:middle line:84%
say, there's always
a way to do it?

00:16:33.000 --> 00:16:34.430 align:middle line:90%
And do you model--

00:16:34.430 --> 00:16:39.140 align:middle line:84%
not just speak the words, but
model in life for your children

00:16:39.140 --> 00:16:42.380 align:middle line:84%
the possibilities that you would
hope to instill within them,

00:16:42.380 --> 00:16:44.670 align:middle line:90%
to empower them in life?

00:16:44.670 --> 00:16:47.840 align:middle line:84%
And so this is where
the conscious awareness

00:16:47.840 --> 00:16:50.510 align:middle line:84%
comes and of not only the
language, but the actions

00:16:50.510 --> 00:16:51.320 align:middle line:90%
as well.

00:16:51.320 --> 00:16:55.490 align:middle line:84%
Conscious parenting
begins with self awareness

00:16:55.490 --> 00:16:57.970 align:middle line:90%
of each individual parent.

00:16:57.970 --> 00:17:00.860 align:middle line:84%
This is where another
question comes up often,

00:17:00.860 --> 00:17:03.710 align:middle line:84%
because often parents
don't see eye to eye.

00:17:03.710 --> 00:17:04.710 align:middle line:90%
They don't think alike.

00:17:04.710 --> 00:17:07.369 align:middle line:84%
And so what happens
when one parent has

00:17:07.369 --> 00:17:10.490 align:middle line:84%
one idea of the way their
children or their child

00:17:10.490 --> 00:17:14.780 align:middle line:84%
should be raised, another one
may not be on board with that?

00:17:14.780 --> 00:17:18.062 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to answer that by
going to an even deeper level.

00:17:18.062 --> 00:17:19.520 align:middle line:84%
It's not just about
parenting, it's

00:17:19.520 --> 00:17:21.859 align:middle line:84%
about growing
together as a couple.

00:17:21.859 --> 00:17:25.310 align:middle line:84%
When two humans come
together as a couple, two

00:17:25.310 --> 00:17:29.960 align:middle line:84%
mature, adult humans, it is
rare that those two humans

00:17:29.960 --> 00:17:32.750 align:middle line:84%
will always track
one another when

00:17:32.750 --> 00:17:37.190 align:middle line:84%
it comes to new directions, new
interests, new explorations,

00:17:37.190 --> 00:17:38.140 align:middle line:90%
and growth and life.

00:17:38.140 --> 00:17:40.380 align:middle line:84%
We simply do not grow
at the same rate.

00:17:40.380 --> 00:17:41.746 align:middle line:90%
The partnership.

00:17:41.746 --> 00:17:43.370 align:middle line:84%
When we talk about
conscious parenting,

00:17:43.370 --> 00:17:46.040 align:middle line:84%
I believe it begins with
conscious partnership.

00:17:46.040 --> 00:17:49.550 align:middle line:84%
When we choose our partnerships,
when we invite another person

00:17:49.550 --> 00:17:52.100 align:middle line:84%
into our lives, one of the
fundamental questions I think

00:17:52.100 --> 00:17:55.070 align:middle line:84%
we must ask ourselves
is can I grow

00:17:55.070 --> 00:17:57.350 align:middle line:90%
with this person in my life?

00:17:57.350 --> 00:18:01.790 align:middle line:84%
Can I myself explore
new possibilities

00:18:01.790 --> 00:18:03.740 align:middle line:84%
and allow them the
freedom to explore theirs,

00:18:03.740 --> 00:18:05.880 align:middle line:84%
and we come together
and share what we found,

00:18:05.880 --> 00:18:08.360 align:middle line:84%
and where there's overlap
enjoy that together,

00:18:08.360 --> 00:18:11.510 align:middle line:84%
and where there's not, give one
another the freedom to do that?

00:18:11.510 --> 00:18:13.010 align:middle line:90%
That's an important question.

00:18:13.010 --> 00:18:15.920 align:middle line:84%
When it comes to parenting,
the same thing has to happen.

00:18:15.920 --> 00:18:18.530 align:middle line:84%
The agreements have to
be made with the parents

00:18:18.530 --> 00:18:22.130 align:middle line:84%
before the principles are ever
laid out before the children.

00:18:22.130 --> 00:18:23.990 align:middle line:84%
All of this comes
into self-awareness,

00:18:23.990 --> 00:18:26.390 align:middle line:84%
and that's what I think
conscious parenting is really

00:18:26.390 --> 00:18:29.040 align:middle line:90%
all about.

00:18:29.040 --> 00:18:32.870 align:middle line:84%
I was recently asked a question
about bringing children

00:18:32.870 --> 00:18:33.670 align:middle line:90%
into the world.

00:18:33.670 --> 00:18:36.880 align:middle line:84%
How I'd feel about doing it
now as opposed to other times

00:18:36.880 --> 00:18:41.930 align:middle line:84%
in history, maybe when the world
seemed a little more stable.

00:18:41.930 --> 00:18:44.510 align:middle line:84%
That's a good question,
let me tell you a story.

00:18:44.510 --> 00:18:46.680 align:middle line:84%
So I got on the plane
one day, and there

00:18:46.680 --> 00:18:48.980 align:middle line:84%
was an Air Force cadet that
was sitting next to me.

00:18:48.980 --> 00:18:50.480 align:middle line:84%
And he asked me the
usual questions,

00:18:50.480 --> 00:18:52.700 align:middle line:84%
he said, so,
business or pleasure?

00:18:52.700 --> 00:18:55.132 align:middle line:90%
I said, yes.

00:18:55.132 --> 00:18:56.840 align:middle line:84%
And he said, what do
you do for a living?

00:18:56.840 --> 00:18:58.580 align:middle line:84%
And I said, well,
how long do you have?

00:18:58.580 --> 00:19:00.246 align:middle line:84%
And he said, well,
I've got three hours.

00:19:00.246 --> 00:19:02.570 align:middle line:84%
And I said, let me
tell you what I do.

00:19:02.570 --> 00:19:05.900 align:middle line:84%
And at the end the conversation,
he asked me a question.

00:19:05.900 --> 00:19:08.296 align:middle line:84%
He said, do you and your
wife have any children?

00:19:08.296 --> 00:19:10.190 align:middle line:84%
And I said, I've
never been blessed

00:19:10.190 --> 00:19:11.726 align:middle line:90%
with a child in my life.

00:19:11.726 --> 00:19:13.100 align:middle line:84%
I said, do you
have any children?

00:19:13.100 --> 00:19:14.420 align:middle line:90%
He said, no.

00:19:14.420 --> 00:19:16.040 align:middle line:84%
He said my wife and
I made a choice,

00:19:16.040 --> 00:19:18.500 align:middle line:84%
we would never bring a
child into the world the way

00:19:18.500 --> 00:19:19.460 align:middle line:90%
it is today.

00:19:19.460 --> 00:19:20.750 align:middle line:90%
I said, really?

00:19:20.750 --> 00:19:23.840 align:middle line:10%
He said, the world is
a mess, it's unsafe,

00:19:23.840 --> 00:19:24.890 align:middle line:10%
it's falling apart.

00:19:24.890 --> 00:19:27.925 align:middle line:10%
The terrorism, the crime,
the drugs, he said,

00:19:27.925 --> 00:19:30.050 align:middle line:10%
we would never bring a
child into the world the way

00:19:30.050 --> 00:19:30.850 align:middle line:10%
it is right now.

00:19:30.850 --> 00:19:32.775 align:middle line:84%
And I said, wow,
that's interesting.

00:19:32.775 --> 00:19:35.114 align:middle line:84%
And I said, that's one
way of thinking of it.

00:19:35.114 --> 00:19:36.530 align:middle line:84%
And he said, is
there another way?

00:19:36.530 --> 00:19:38.380 align:middle line:90%
And I said, I believe there is.

00:19:38.380 --> 00:19:40.760 align:middle line:84%
I said, let me ask you a
question, why would you

00:19:40.760 --> 00:19:46.020 align:middle line:84%
ever deny a child, a
soul, the opportunity

00:19:46.020 --> 00:19:48.780 align:middle line:84%
to come into the
world right now,

00:19:48.780 --> 00:19:51.510 align:middle line:90%
when everything is up for grabs?

00:19:51.510 --> 00:19:55.650 align:middle line:84%
The whole world is
up for something new.

00:19:55.650 --> 00:19:58.860 align:middle line:84%
Everything is falling apart,
the systems are breaking down.

00:19:58.860 --> 00:20:02.850 align:middle line:84%
Why would you deny a
soul the opportunity

00:20:02.850 --> 00:20:06.720 align:middle line:84%
to come into the world now when
one heart, one soul, one mind,

00:20:06.720 --> 00:20:09.420 align:middle line:84%
a new idea can be
embraced to such a degree

00:20:09.420 --> 00:20:12.480 align:middle line:84%
that that idea could change
the whole world in a way that

00:20:12.480 --> 00:20:14.820 align:middle line:90%
is rare and precious?

00:20:14.820 --> 00:20:17.680 align:middle line:84%
Why would you ever deny
a child that opportunity?

00:20:17.680 --> 00:20:19.440 align:middle line:84%
Then our plane landed
and he disappeared,

00:20:19.440 --> 00:20:20.730 align:middle line:90%
and I didn't see them.

00:20:20.730 --> 00:20:24.090 align:middle line:84%
And I went to baggage
to get my luggage,

00:20:24.090 --> 00:20:25.460 align:middle line:90%
and he was dashing out the door.

00:20:25.460 --> 00:20:28.509 align:middle line:84%
And I wanted to say thank
you for the conversation, I

00:20:28.509 --> 00:20:30.550 align:middle line:84%
said, you're in a big
hurry, where are you going?

00:20:30.550 --> 00:20:31.830 align:middle line:90%
And he said, are you kidding?

00:20:31.830 --> 00:20:34.038 align:middle line:84%
He said, after that conversation
I'm going home right

00:20:34.038 --> 00:20:36.090 align:middle line:90%
now to make a baby.

00:20:36.090 --> 00:20:37.650 align:middle line:90%
And I thought, great.

00:20:37.650 --> 00:20:40.050 align:middle line:84%
So I'm sharing this
story for a reason.

00:20:40.050 --> 00:20:43.920 align:middle line:84%
It's all about perspective
and how we see the world.

00:20:43.920 --> 00:20:45.000 align:middle line:90%
Is the world volatile?

00:20:45.000 --> 00:20:45.800 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

00:20:45.800 --> 00:20:47.970 align:middle line:90%
Is the world dangerous?

00:20:47.970 --> 00:20:48.960 align:middle line:90%
It can be.

00:20:48.960 --> 00:20:51.360 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't have to
be, but it can be.

00:20:51.360 --> 00:20:55.530 align:middle line:84%
And it's also, everything I
said to that Air Force cadet,

00:20:55.530 --> 00:21:00.300 align:middle line:84%
this is a time when the
upheaval and the uncertainty

00:21:00.300 --> 00:21:03.210 align:middle line:84%
creates an opening that
is actually very rare.

00:21:03.210 --> 00:21:06.219 align:middle line:84%
When everything is working and
all the systems are buttoned

00:21:06.219 --> 00:21:08.010 align:middle line:84%
up, and they're locked
down, and everything

00:21:08.010 --> 00:21:11.730 align:middle line:84%
is working like clockwork,
there's no need for change.

00:21:11.730 --> 00:21:13.440 align:middle line:90%
And change is hard.

00:21:13.440 --> 00:21:15.000 align:middle line:84%
When things are
falling apart, that's

00:21:15.000 --> 00:21:18.130 align:middle line:84%
when there's an opening for
new ideas, new concepts,

00:21:18.130 --> 00:21:20.880 align:middle line:84%
new innovations, new inventions,
new ways of governing,

00:21:20.880 --> 00:21:22.230 align:middle line:90%
new ways of thinking.

00:21:22.230 --> 00:21:26.740 align:middle line:84%
Energy, food, finances,
economics, healing, everything.

00:21:26.740 --> 00:21:28.630 align:middle line:90%
That's where we are right now.

00:21:28.630 --> 00:21:32.010 align:middle line:84%
So when it comes to bringing
a child into this world,

00:21:32.010 --> 00:21:34.740 align:middle line:84%
I can't think of a
better time to do it.

00:21:34.740 --> 00:21:39.810 align:middle line:84%
The other side of this coin
is that I believe strongly

00:21:39.810 --> 00:21:42.520 align:middle line:84%
coming from the family and the
background that I've done this

00:21:42.520 --> 00:21:46.680 align:middle line:84%
it should only happen
when two people are deeply

00:21:46.680 --> 00:21:50.250 align:middle line:90%
committed to making the time--

00:21:50.250 --> 00:21:53.760 align:middle line:84%
not just finding spare
time when it's available--

00:21:53.760 --> 00:21:58.020 align:middle line:84%
but creating the time to
intentionally and consciously

00:21:58.020 --> 00:22:01.050 align:middle line:84%
bring the child into the world,
bring a new soul into this

00:22:01.050 --> 00:22:07.380 align:middle line:84%
world, and give them the
tools early in their life--

00:22:07.380 --> 00:22:11.700 align:middle line:84%
consciously, subconsciously,
visually, all the tools--

00:22:11.700 --> 00:22:13.950 align:middle line:84%
even before they're in
school, before they're even

00:22:13.950 --> 00:22:19.460 align:middle line:84%
in kindergarten, that help them
to realize that they're safe,

00:22:19.460 --> 00:22:22.262 align:middle line:84%
that they are part of the world
rather than separate from it,

00:22:22.262 --> 00:22:23.970 align:middle line:84%
that they live in the
world of connection

00:22:23.970 --> 00:22:25.428 align:middle line:84%
rather than
separation, that nature

00:22:25.428 --> 00:22:29.010 align:middle line:84%
is based upon cooperation
rather than competition.

00:22:29.010 --> 00:22:31.770 align:middle line:84%
And those fundamental
tools will inform them

00:22:31.770 --> 00:22:33.960 align:middle line:84%
in every situation
that will ever

00:22:33.960 --> 00:22:37.290 align:middle line:84%
come to their doorstep, that
will ever cross their paths.

00:22:37.290 --> 00:22:40.570 align:middle line:10%
And if that agreement, if
that commitment can be made,

00:22:40.570 --> 00:22:42.270 align:middle line:10%
I think it's a
perfect time to bring

00:22:42.270 --> 00:22:43.410 align:middle line:10%
a new life into this world.

00:22:43.410 --> 00:22:48.480 align:middle line:90%


00:22:48.480 --> 00:22:51.820 align:middle line:10%
So a question that comes
to me so frequently today

00:22:51.820 --> 00:22:55.000 align:middle line:10%
after the books were written
about the Indigo Children

00:22:55.000 --> 00:22:59.080 align:middle line:10%
back in the '80s and '90s
is, what do we do as parents?

00:22:59.080 --> 00:23:03.124 align:middle line:84%
If we have maybe not indigo
in the sense of the way

00:23:03.124 --> 00:23:04.540 align:middle line:84%
the book was
written, but children

00:23:04.540 --> 00:23:07.201 align:middle line:84%
that are especially
sensitive in the way

00:23:07.201 --> 00:23:09.700 align:middle line:84%
that they process information,
in their intuitive abilities,

00:23:09.700 --> 00:23:12.430 align:middle line:84%
in their psychic abilities,
that are having a hard time,

00:23:12.430 --> 00:23:16.250 align:middle line:84%
but don't really fit into the
world and educational system

00:23:16.250 --> 00:23:17.050 align:middle line:90%
as we see it today.

00:23:17.050 --> 00:23:18.587 align:middle line:90%
And I think is a good question.

00:23:18.587 --> 00:23:20.170 align:middle line:84%
And it's a good
question because we're

00:23:20.170 --> 00:23:23.350 align:middle line:84%
seeing more and more of
these kinds of young people.

00:23:23.350 --> 00:23:25.100 align:middle line:84%
Now, I don't think
there's a pat answer,

00:23:25.100 --> 00:23:26.770 align:middle line:84%
I don't think there
is any one answer,

00:23:26.770 --> 00:23:29.620 align:middle line:84%
because every young
person is different.

00:23:29.620 --> 00:23:33.490 align:middle line:84%
So I cannot give one answer
that's going to be one size

00:23:33.490 --> 00:23:37.580 align:middle line:84%
fits all for every young
person, I can say in general.

00:23:37.580 --> 00:23:40.126 align:middle line:10%
My experience, and I have
very close friends that

00:23:40.126 --> 00:23:41.500 align:middle line:10%
are in this
situation, and I have

00:23:41.500 --> 00:23:43.480 align:middle line:10%
been in communities
where I've seen

00:23:43.480 --> 00:23:45.580 align:middle line:10%
different approaches taken.

00:23:45.580 --> 00:23:51.520 align:middle line:84%
What I've found does not work is
to isolate these very sensitive

00:23:51.520 --> 00:23:56.620 align:middle line:84%
young people and artificially
make the world easy for them

00:23:56.620 --> 00:23:58.932 align:middle line:90%
because of their sensitivities.

00:23:58.932 --> 00:24:01.390 align:middle line:84%
It does not work, the parents
will do that thinking they're

00:24:01.390 --> 00:24:03.820 align:middle line:90%
protecting the children.

00:24:03.820 --> 00:24:05.620 align:middle line:84%
And they are on
one hand, they're

00:24:05.620 --> 00:24:10.210 align:middle line:84%
protecting them from the
very culture and the skills

00:24:10.210 --> 00:24:14.050 align:middle line:84%
that they need to function in
a meaningful way in the world

00:24:14.050 --> 00:24:16.030 align:middle line:84%
that they're going to
find themselves in.

00:24:16.030 --> 00:24:19.150 align:middle line:84%
So I think it's about
finding a balance of honoring

00:24:19.150 --> 00:24:23.280 align:middle line:84%
those sensitivities, because we
all have them to some degree.

00:24:23.280 --> 00:24:28.240 align:middle line:84%
Deep intuition, access to
the subconscious, empathy,

00:24:28.240 --> 00:24:32.050 align:middle line:84%
sympathy, compassion, we all
have these to some degree.

00:24:32.050 --> 00:24:33.580 align:middle line:84%
Many of the young
people that are

00:24:33.580 --> 00:24:38.470 align:middle line:84%
coming in now, these
abilities have at birth

00:24:38.470 --> 00:24:41.200 align:middle line:84%
seemed to be developed
to a very high degree.

00:24:41.200 --> 00:24:46.240 align:middle line:84%
So it's about honoring those and
helping those young people find

00:24:46.240 --> 00:24:49.300 align:middle line:84%
where that fits into the world
that they have arrived in.

00:24:49.300 --> 00:24:52.180 align:middle line:84%
This is where they will
find their strength.

00:24:52.180 --> 00:24:54.400 align:middle line:84%
If they cannot
function in the world,

00:24:54.400 --> 00:24:56.740 align:middle line:90%
the abilities become a curse.

00:24:56.740 --> 00:24:58.330 align:middle line:84%
But if they can
function in the world

00:24:58.330 --> 00:25:01.360 align:middle line:84%
and apply the abilities
throughout their lives,

00:25:01.360 --> 00:25:03.470 align:middle line:90%
then they become a gift.

00:25:03.470 --> 00:25:04.850 align:middle line:90%
It's a double edged sword.

00:25:04.850 --> 00:25:10.450 align:middle line:84%
So I think it is finding this
middle ground of encouraging

00:25:10.450 --> 00:25:13.450 align:middle line:84%
these abilities, but
maybe not touting them.

00:25:13.450 --> 00:25:19.640 align:middle line:84%
So what I mean by that is young
people who are highly empathic,

00:25:19.640 --> 00:25:20.440 align:middle line:90%
for example.

00:25:20.440 --> 00:25:24.670 align:middle line:84%
So that means they're
feeling what other people are

00:25:24.670 --> 00:25:27.020 align:middle line:90%
feeling all the time.

00:25:27.020 --> 00:25:30.524 align:middle line:84%
The key is to help those
young people know what's them

00:25:30.524 --> 00:25:31.690 align:middle line:90%
and what's the other person.

00:25:31.690 --> 00:25:34.930 align:middle line:84%
Where are they
picking up those, how

00:25:34.930 --> 00:25:37.420 align:middle line:84%
do they know when those
feelings are their own, how

00:25:37.420 --> 00:25:40.360 align:middle line:84%
do they know when they're
coming from someone else?

00:25:40.360 --> 00:25:43.300 align:middle line:84%
And to help them discern--
not to judge, but discern--

00:25:43.300 --> 00:25:44.620 align:middle line:90%
what that is.

00:25:44.620 --> 00:25:45.970 align:middle line:90%
So encouraging them to do that.

00:25:45.970 --> 00:25:49.400 align:middle line:84%
One of the ways, the specifics
to go about doing this,

00:25:49.400 --> 00:25:52.900 align:middle line:84%
and this is why I shared
what I did in Missing Links.

00:25:52.900 --> 00:25:55.420 align:middle line:84%
There are a couple of episodes
of Missing Links where

00:25:55.420 --> 00:25:58.840 align:middle line:84%
I refer to this deep
connection between the heart

00:25:58.840 --> 00:25:59.980 align:middle line:90%
and the brain.

00:25:59.980 --> 00:26:01.420 align:middle line:84%
Two separate
organs, but they can

00:26:01.420 --> 00:26:05.860 align:middle line:84%
be harmonized into a single,
functional, powerful, potent

00:26:05.860 --> 00:26:11.080 align:middle line:84%
system that gives us the
ability for deep intuition

00:26:11.080 --> 00:26:14.410 align:middle line:84%
and triggering, the self-healing
and the self-triggering

00:26:14.410 --> 00:26:19.000 align:middle line:84%
of a strong immune system
and anti-aging hormones.

00:26:19.000 --> 00:26:21.010 align:middle line:84%
When we learn to do
that intentionally,

00:26:21.010 --> 00:26:22.870 align:middle line:84%
a byproduct of
harmonizing the heart

00:26:22.870 --> 00:26:25.240 align:middle line:84%
and the brain, which is
actually a natural state

00:26:25.240 --> 00:26:27.670 align:middle line:84%
of being that we've
been conditioned out of.

00:26:27.670 --> 00:26:32.170 align:middle line:84%
So when we can help our young
people to be in this state,

00:26:32.170 --> 00:26:34.810 align:middle line:84%
it balances, it
grounds them internally

00:26:34.810 --> 00:26:38.590 align:middle line:84%
with their special
skills so that when

00:26:38.590 --> 00:26:40.270 align:middle line:84%
they go into the
world they don't

00:26:40.270 --> 00:26:42.680 align:middle line:84%
feel like such an
oddity on the one hand.

00:26:42.680 --> 00:26:45.220 align:middle line:84%
On the other hand, they
don't have to tout,

00:26:45.220 --> 00:26:46.810 align:middle line:90%
they don't have to show off.

00:26:46.810 --> 00:26:49.840 align:middle line:84%
For example, a lot
of people are taught

00:26:49.840 --> 00:26:54.880 align:middle line:84%
to display these skills
among peers in school that

00:26:54.880 --> 00:26:56.740 align:middle line:90%
can't do the same thing.

00:26:56.740 --> 00:26:58.540 align:middle line:84%
And for young
people who are going

00:26:58.540 --> 00:27:00.640 align:middle line:84%
through the building
of identity,

00:27:00.640 --> 00:27:03.130 align:middle line:84%
this can be a very
vulnerable time.

00:27:03.130 --> 00:27:07.690 align:middle line:10%
The Kogi indigenous people
in South America, when

00:27:07.690 --> 00:27:09.280 align:middle line:10%
their young people
are born, they're

00:27:09.280 --> 00:27:11.530 align:middle line:10%
born very sensitive as well.

00:27:11.530 --> 00:27:13.360 align:middle line:84%
They do something
very different than we

00:27:13.360 --> 00:27:14.901 align:middle line:84%
do with our young
people, and I'm not

00:27:14.901 --> 00:27:16.890 align:middle line:84%
suggesting that
you do this per se,

00:27:16.890 --> 00:27:19.810 align:middle line:84%
but I'm using this to
illustrate an example.

00:27:19.810 --> 00:27:23.710 align:middle line:84%
Our young people are
born and conditioned

00:27:23.710 --> 00:27:27.790 align:middle line:84%
to see the world
through their mind

00:27:27.790 --> 00:27:32.080 align:middle line:84%
and through their
visual senses primarily.

00:27:32.080 --> 00:27:34.630 align:middle line:84%
The Kogi children
are isolated and kept

00:27:34.630 --> 00:27:36.900 align:middle line:84%
in relative darkness
for the first year or so

00:27:36.900 --> 00:27:37.700 align:middle line:90%
of their lives.

00:27:37.700 --> 00:27:40.240 align:middle line:84%
Now to us, that sounds
like a cruel thing to do.

00:27:40.240 --> 00:27:41.530 align:middle line:90%
It's all about how it's done.

00:27:41.530 --> 00:27:43.900 align:middle line:84%
They are nurtured,
they are loved,

00:27:43.900 --> 00:27:47.710 align:middle line:84%
they are taught to see the
world not through their mind,

00:27:47.710 --> 00:27:49.300 align:middle line:90%
but through their heart.

00:27:49.300 --> 00:27:50.729 align:middle line:90%
Now we know why.

00:27:50.729 --> 00:27:52.270 align:middle line:84%
Because modern
science is telling us,

00:27:52.270 --> 00:27:54.070 align:middle line:84%
and I shared it
in Missing Links.

00:27:54.070 --> 00:27:57.490 align:middle line:84%
40,000 specialized cells in the
human heart, sensory neurites.

00:27:57.490 --> 00:28:00.280 align:middle line:84%
They're like brain cells,
but they're in the heart.

00:28:00.280 --> 00:28:02.845 align:middle line:84%
They think, they feel,
they learn independently

00:28:02.845 --> 00:28:04.670 align:middle line:90%
of the brain in the head.

00:28:04.670 --> 00:28:07.870 align:middle line:84%
So what has been
happening for millennia

00:28:07.870 --> 00:28:11.530 align:middle line:84%
is that the Kogi are
teaching their young people

00:28:11.530 --> 00:28:15.520 align:middle line:84%
to interpret the world
through their heart first,

00:28:15.520 --> 00:28:18.340 align:middle line:84%
and then to begin
to balance that

00:28:18.340 --> 00:28:22.630 align:middle line:84%
through the visual input in
the mental and the logic senses

00:28:22.630 --> 00:28:23.560 align:middle line:90%
later.

00:28:23.560 --> 00:28:26.440 align:middle line:84%
We teach our young people
to interpret the world

00:28:26.440 --> 00:28:29.890 align:middle line:84%
through their visual senses
and through their mind first,

00:28:29.890 --> 00:28:31.690 align:middle line:84%
and if they're lucky
as adults, they maybe

00:28:31.690 --> 00:28:34.060 align:middle line:84%
get to explore their
heart a little bit.

00:28:34.060 --> 00:28:36.340 align:middle line:84%
But it is this balance
that helps young people

00:28:36.340 --> 00:28:38.260 align:middle line:84%
to feel grounded,
because they're

00:28:38.260 --> 00:28:41.290 align:middle line:84%
honoring their gifts rather
than trying to hide them,

00:28:41.290 --> 00:28:46.060 align:middle line:84%
or having them in a situation
where they're not understood.

00:28:46.060 --> 00:28:50.200 align:middle line:84%
One of the ways that parents
I'm seeing do this especially

00:28:50.200 --> 00:28:53.480 align:middle line:84%
in rural communities is
they're home schooling longer.

00:28:53.480 --> 00:28:55.150 align:middle line:84%
So in the home
schooling environment,

00:28:55.150 --> 00:28:58.540 align:middle line:84%
the parents can create
this balance of academia

00:28:58.540 --> 00:29:01.560 align:middle line:84%
and emotional
sensitivity, blend it,

00:29:01.560 --> 00:29:05.050 align:middle line:84%
harmonize it during
the formative years

00:29:05.050 --> 00:29:07.330 align:middle line:84%
so that when the young
people are finished with home

00:29:07.330 --> 00:29:11.860 align:middle line:84%
schooling and they go into the
universities, they are equipped

00:29:11.860 --> 00:29:13.954 align:middle line:84%
and they typically will
excel when they do this.

00:29:13.954 --> 00:29:15.870 align:middle line:84%
And I've seen this in
intentional communities,

00:29:15.870 --> 00:29:18.520 align:middle line:90%
Damanhur in Italy, for example.

00:29:18.520 --> 00:29:21.410 align:middle line:84%
An intentional community
has been there since 1970s.

00:29:21.410 --> 00:29:24.010 align:middle line:90%
It was founded in the 1970s.

00:29:24.010 --> 00:29:26.470 align:middle line:84%
They have about 600
people living together,

00:29:26.470 --> 00:29:29.500 align:middle line:84%
and they're a community,
they have their own currency,

00:29:29.500 --> 00:29:31.390 align:middle line:84%
they have their own
way of growing food,

00:29:31.390 --> 00:29:35.460 align:middle line:84%
they have their own way of
educating their young people.

00:29:35.460 --> 00:29:38.590 align:middle line:84%
And their young people are very
sensitive, and I've met them.

00:29:38.590 --> 00:29:41.390 align:middle line:84%
And when they leave the
Damanhur community--

00:29:41.390 --> 00:29:43.920 align:middle line:84%
and I'm just using
this as an example--

00:29:43.920 --> 00:29:45.820 align:middle line:84%
and they go into
the public schools,

00:29:45.820 --> 00:29:49.120 align:middle line:84%
they are lightyears
ahead of typically

00:29:49.120 --> 00:29:51.460 align:middle line:84%
where the public schools
have led their peers.

00:29:51.460 --> 00:29:55.270 align:middle line:84%
They excel in
everything because they

00:29:55.270 --> 00:30:00.400 align:middle line:84%
have had the benefit of
blending and honoring

00:30:00.400 --> 00:30:04.530 align:middle line:84%
their intuitive gifts with
the concrete knowledge

00:30:04.530 --> 00:30:06.740 align:middle line:84%
that they need to
make it in the world.

00:30:06.740 --> 00:30:08.680 align:middle line:84%
So I think this is where
education is going.

00:30:08.680 --> 00:30:10.750 align:middle line:84%
Because this is
our true is nature,

00:30:10.750 --> 00:30:11.980 align:middle line:90%
we all have these gifts.

00:30:11.980 --> 00:30:14.410 align:middle line:84%
It's just that the young
people coming in now, I think,

00:30:14.410 --> 00:30:17.440 align:middle line:84%
have a greater access
to them sooner in life,

00:30:17.440 --> 00:30:20.140 align:middle line:84%
and we as adults
are being forced now

00:30:20.140 --> 00:30:23.259 align:middle line:84%
to make place for
that in the way

00:30:23.259 --> 00:30:24.550 align:middle line:90%
that we teach our young people.

00:30:24.550 --> 00:30:27.170 align:middle line:90%


00:30:27.170 --> 00:30:29.470 align:middle line:84%
So when I think about
everything that we talk about

00:30:29.470 --> 00:30:30.940 align:middle line:84%
in this episode,
and particularly

00:30:30.940 --> 00:30:34.390 align:middle line:84%
when it comes to education,
conscious education, parenting,

00:30:34.390 --> 00:30:37.540 align:middle line:84%
conscious parenting, I had
to sum it all up in one word.

00:30:37.540 --> 00:30:40.790 align:middle line:84%
For me, that were be
the word honoring.

00:30:40.790 --> 00:30:42.340 align:middle line:90%
It's about honoring what is.

00:30:42.340 --> 00:30:46.660 align:middle line:84%
We are living in a time
of extremes in our world.

00:30:46.660 --> 00:30:49.990 align:middle line:84%
And we are asked
to be in the world

00:30:49.990 --> 00:30:52.750 align:middle line:84%
by embracing the deepest
truths of our existence

00:30:52.750 --> 00:30:55.480 align:middle line:84%
rather than denying
our sensitivity,

00:30:55.480 --> 00:30:58.090 align:middle line:84%
or denying the sensitivity
of our young people.

00:30:58.090 --> 00:31:01.690 align:middle line:84%
Honor those and find a way to
integrate those sensitivities

00:31:01.690 --> 00:31:05.590 align:middle line:84%
in a meaningful, and honest,
and truthful way, concrete way

00:31:05.590 --> 00:31:07.800 align:middle line:90%
in our everyday lives.

00:31:07.800 --> 00:31:20.214 align:middle line:90%
