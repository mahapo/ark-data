00:00:25.454 --> 00:00:26.370 align:middle line:90%
>>GREGG BRADEN: Hello.

00:00:26.370 --> 00:00:27.960 align:middle line:10%
My name's Gregg
Braden, and I'd like

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:30.750 align:middle line:10%
to be the first to
welcome you to this very

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:35.670 align:middle line:10%
special presentation of "Missing
Links: Simulation by Design:

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:38.880 align:middle line:10%
Are We Living in a
Virtual Reality?"

00:00:38.880 --> 00:00:40.920 align:middle line:84%
I am your host for
this entire series,

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:43.140 align:middle line:84%
and I'm absolutely thrilled
to personally bring

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:46.650 align:middle line:84%
each and every episode of this
all new "Missing Links" program

00:00:46.650 --> 00:00:48.040 align:middle line:90%
directly to you.

00:00:48.040 --> 00:00:51.180 align:middle line:84%
And I want you to know
why I'm so excited.

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:54.190 align:middle line:84%
There's a growing body
of scientific evidence

00:00:54.190 --> 00:00:55.980 align:middle line:84%
that now suggests
that we are living

00:00:55.980 --> 00:01:01.110 align:middle line:84%
our lives inside of a digital
simulation, a massive computer

00:01:01.110 --> 00:01:05.370 align:middle line:84%
program the size of the universe
that began running long, long

00:01:05.370 --> 00:01:07.710 align:middle line:84%
ago, sometime in
our ancient past,

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:11.700 align:middle line:84%
creating the virtual reality
we see as our everyday world

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:12.980 align:middle line:90%
right now.

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:16.420 align:middle line:84%
Well, the implications of such
a discovery, they're huge,

00:01:16.420 --> 00:01:18.210 align:middle line:84%
they're vast, they're
deep, and they

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:22.200 align:middle line:84%
tear right into the core of
our most intimate beliefs

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:24.840 align:middle line:84%
about everything from
healing and disease

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:29.100 align:middle line:84%
to war and peace, life, death,
religion, god, angels, ETs,

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:32.420 align:middle line:84%
aliens, UFOs, the
cosmos, and even beyond.

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:35.790 align:middle line:84%
Now I know that the possibility
itself may sound like something

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:37.740 align:middle line:90%
from a science fiction movie.

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:40.650 align:middle line:84%
And I know that because
it did to me as well.

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:44.200 align:middle line:84%
That is, until I began to
consider the new evidence.

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:46.530 align:middle line:84%
And that's what this
series is all about.

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:49.710 align:middle line:84%
In this program we'll
explore the discoveries,

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:52.090 align:middle line:84%
where they lead, what
they mean in our lives,

00:01:52.090 --> 00:01:53.620 align:middle line:90%
what they're telling us today.

00:01:53.620 --> 00:01:56.790 align:middle line:84%
So let's begin at the beginning
with what scientists are now

00:01:56.790 --> 00:01:59.940 align:middle line:90%
calling the forbidden question.

00:01:59.940 --> 00:02:03.630 align:middle line:84%
Is it possible that each moment
of every day of our lives

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:07.740 align:middle line:84%
is actually happening inside of
a simulated reality that looks

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:10.080 align:middle line:90%
and feels totally real to us?

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:15.850 align:middle line:90%


00:02:15.850 --> 00:02:19.870 align:middle line:84%
First, I'd like to be
absolutely clear about precisely

00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:23.260 align:middle line:84%
what a simulation is, what
I'm talking about when

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:25.730 align:middle line:90%
I refer to a simulation.

00:02:25.730 --> 00:02:28.900 align:middle line:84%
A simulation is
an experience that

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:32.900 align:middle line:84%
allows us to immerse ourselves
in an unfamiliar environment,

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:33.700 align:middle line:90%
first.

00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:38.050 align:middle line:84%
And second, it allows us
to master the parameters

00:02:38.050 --> 00:02:41.710 align:middle line:84%
of that environment in
a relatively safe way

00:02:41.710 --> 00:02:44.230 align:middle line:84%
while minimizing
the risk of injury

00:02:44.230 --> 00:02:46.600 align:middle line:90%
to ourselves or to one another.

00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:49.180 align:middle line:84%
So the idea of a
digital environment

00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:51.370 align:middle line:84%
is certainly nothing
new for us today.

00:02:51.370 --> 00:02:53.500 align:middle line:84%
We already use
simulated environments

00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:55.340 align:middle line:90%
in a number of places.

00:02:55.340 --> 00:02:57.940 align:middle line:10%
For example, what you're
seeing on your screen

00:02:57.940 --> 00:03:00.940 align:middle line:10%
right now is a
musical awards show.

00:03:00.940 --> 00:03:03.820 align:middle line:10%
It was actually hosted
in Orlando, Florida,

00:03:03.820 --> 00:03:06.730 align:middle line:10%
and the woman that you're
seeing standing on the left

00:03:06.730 --> 00:03:09.700 align:middle line:10%
is the host, is the
emcee of the program.

00:03:09.700 --> 00:03:14.440 align:middle line:10%
And she's presenting an award to
two musicians who could not be

00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:17.080 align:middle line:10%
present at the actual ceremony.

00:03:17.080 --> 00:03:21.490 align:middle line:10%
Because of schedules, they are
performing in London, England.

00:03:21.490 --> 00:03:23.690 align:middle line:10%
Now the audience
didn't know that.

00:03:23.690 --> 00:03:27.940 align:middle line:10%
So you're seeing a holographic
projection, a virtual reality

00:03:27.940 --> 00:03:32.560 align:middle line:10%
of those two performers as
if they are live on stage

00:03:32.560 --> 00:03:33.970 align:middle line:10%
with the emcee.

00:03:33.970 --> 00:03:35.710 align:middle line:84%
And as you see on
your screen, it's

00:03:35.710 --> 00:03:38.270 align:middle line:84%
very difficult to tell that
they are not actually there.

00:03:38.270 --> 00:03:41.140 align:middle line:84%
The audience didn't know that
these people were not really

00:03:41.140 --> 00:03:41.950 align:middle line:90%
there.

00:03:41.950 --> 00:03:45.040 align:middle line:84%
And it was from
this digital reality

00:03:45.040 --> 00:03:47.230 align:middle line:84%
that the two were
able to interact

00:03:47.230 --> 00:03:49.540 align:middle line:84%
the performers and
emcee so that they

00:03:49.540 --> 00:03:52.710 align:middle line:84%
can receive their award without
leaving their home in England.

00:03:52.710 --> 00:03:54.640 align:middle line:84%
And the audience
had the opportunity

00:03:54.640 --> 00:03:56.600 align:middle line:90%
to see the whole thing.

00:03:56.600 --> 00:04:02.200 align:middle line:84%
So this is an example of how we
are using digital environments

00:04:02.200 --> 00:04:06.070 align:middle line:84%
already, simulations, in
the entertainment world.

00:04:06.070 --> 00:04:09.600 align:middle line:84%
And there's another example,
that was even more recent,

00:04:09.600 --> 00:04:13.150 align:middle line:84%
and this was at the 2014
Billboard Music Awards.

00:04:13.150 --> 00:04:15.700 align:middle line:84%
This one, however,
was very controversial

00:04:15.700 --> 00:04:20.800 align:middle line:84%
because it was a video of
Michael Jackson performing

00:04:20.800 --> 00:04:23.980 align:middle line:84%
a song that had
never been released.

00:04:23.980 --> 00:04:27.970 align:middle line:84%
The problem was Michael
Jackson died in 2009.

00:04:27.970 --> 00:04:31.180 align:middle line:84%
And the simulation that
you're going to see

00:04:31.180 --> 00:04:34.810 align:middle line:84%
is so real that people in
the audience, some of them,

00:04:34.810 --> 00:04:39.550 align:middle line:84%
were actually offended
at the reality

00:04:39.550 --> 00:04:43.760 align:middle line:84%
of having a deceased man perform
in front of them on the screen.

00:04:43.760 --> 00:04:46.990 align:middle line:84%
And the point of me sharing
this with you is the audience

00:04:46.990 --> 00:04:50.410 align:middle line:84%
could not tell that this
was a digital reality,

00:04:50.410 --> 00:04:51.650 align:middle line:90%
it looked so real.

00:04:51.650 --> 00:04:52.450 align:middle line:90%
So here it is.

00:04:52.450 --> 00:04:54.048 align:middle line:10%
You can check it
out for yourself.

00:04:54.048 --> 00:05:09.360 align:middle line:10%
[BEGIN VIDEO PLAYBACK - MICHAEL
 JACKSON, "SLAVE TO THE RHYTHM"]

00:05:09.360 --> 00:05:10.160 align:middle line:10%
[END PLAYBACK]

00:05:10.160 --> 00:05:13.190 align:middle line:10%
So what you've just seen
is a beautiful example

00:05:13.190 --> 00:05:17.870 align:middle line:10%
of how far this digital
technology and the ability

00:05:17.870 --> 00:05:21.660 align:middle line:10%
to create simulations have come
in a very short period of time.

00:05:21.660 --> 00:05:24.950 align:middle line:84%
We've only had computers
for about 60 to 70 years.

00:05:24.950 --> 00:05:27.410 align:middle line:84%
People in the audience could
not tell that that was not

00:05:27.410 --> 00:05:28.700 align:middle line:90%
the real Michael Jackson.

00:05:28.700 --> 00:05:30.350 align:middle line:84%
He interacted with
the other dancers,

00:05:30.350 --> 00:05:34.530 align:middle line:84%
he interacted with the audience,
and he looked very real to us.

00:05:34.530 --> 00:05:37.430 align:middle line:84%
So the point here is
that we're already

00:05:37.430 --> 00:05:41.450 align:middle line:84%
using these simulations
in a number of ways

00:05:41.450 --> 00:05:44.210 align:middle line:90%
in our everyday world around us.

00:05:44.210 --> 00:05:46.010 align:middle line:84%
The new theories that
we're talking about

00:05:46.010 --> 00:05:49.040 align:middle line:84%
are asking the question,
are we living within one

00:05:49.040 --> 00:05:51.090 align:middle line:90%
of those simulations?

00:05:51.090 --> 00:05:53.710 align:middle line:84%
Now there are different
kinds of simulations,

00:05:53.710 --> 00:05:56.630 align:middle line:84%
and I've shared a couple
of examples of how they

00:05:56.630 --> 00:05:58.700 align:middle line:90%
can be used in entertainment.

00:05:58.700 --> 00:06:03.500 align:middle line:84%
Many of us are familiar
with the visors, the helmets

00:06:03.500 --> 00:06:06.050 align:middle line:84%
that we can use for a
personal simulation,

00:06:06.050 --> 00:06:09.020 align:middle line:90%
a personal virtual reality.

00:06:09.020 --> 00:06:12.770 align:middle line:84%
And in this case, we place
the visor over our head.

00:06:12.770 --> 00:06:15.440 align:middle line:84%
We have the
experience personally,

00:06:15.440 --> 00:06:19.350 align:middle line:84%
but the people around us are
not having the same experience.

00:06:19.350 --> 00:06:21.270 align:middle line:10%
So as you can see
on the screen, there

00:06:21.270 --> 00:06:25.950 align:middle line:10%
is an example of one man on the
right-hand side of the screen,

00:06:25.950 --> 00:06:27.660 align:middle line:10%
he's having his
personal reality.

00:06:27.660 --> 00:06:30.290 align:middle line:10%
But it we're looking
at him on the outside,

00:06:30.290 --> 00:06:32.150 align:middle line:10%
we can't see what he's seeing.

00:06:32.150 --> 00:06:34.340 align:middle line:10%
On the left-hand
side, you can see

00:06:34.340 --> 00:06:37.560 align:middle line:10%
what it is that he's actually
seeing and interacting with.

00:06:37.560 --> 00:06:40.760 align:middle line:10%
So this is a kind of a
personal virtual reality.

00:06:40.760 --> 00:06:43.970 align:middle line:84%
But we also use personal
realities and simulations

00:06:43.970 --> 00:06:45.230 align:middle line:90%
collectively.

00:06:45.230 --> 00:06:48.800 align:middle line:84%
We use them in places like
planetariums and Sea World

00:06:48.800 --> 00:06:52.040 align:middle line:84%
where we want to portray
an environment, maybe

00:06:52.040 --> 00:06:54.530 align:middle line:84%
in an ancient
environment of dinosaurs

00:06:54.530 --> 00:06:56.480 align:middle line:84%
or an underwater
environment, something

00:06:56.480 --> 00:06:58.260 align:middle line:84%
that we will never
experience personally,

00:06:58.260 --> 00:07:00.330 align:middle line:90%
in our everyday lives.

00:07:00.330 --> 00:07:04.490 align:middle line:10%
So we also use
simulations very commonly

00:07:04.490 --> 00:07:08.720 align:middle line:10%
to train for complex tasks,
sometimes dangerous tasks,

00:07:08.720 --> 00:07:11.780 align:middle line:10%
landing on the moon,
for example, or on Mars,

00:07:11.780 --> 00:07:16.310 align:middle line:10%
emergency response scenarios,
and first responder and wartime

00:07:16.310 --> 00:07:17.630 align:middle line:10%
scenarios.

00:07:17.630 --> 00:07:19.970 align:middle line:84%
We often use
simulations so that we

00:07:19.970 --> 00:07:23.780 align:middle line:84%
can train in a relatively
safe environment

00:07:23.780 --> 00:07:25.670 align:middle line:84%
so that we are
prepared when we need

00:07:25.670 --> 00:07:29.870 align:middle line:84%
to find ourselves in those
dangerous environments.

00:07:29.870 --> 00:07:32.840 align:middle line:10%
Airline cockpit simulators, what
you're seeing on your screen

00:07:32.840 --> 00:07:35.360 align:middle line:10%
right now, the
last thing you want

00:07:35.360 --> 00:07:40.580 align:middle line:10%
is for your pilot to be landing
his plane, a Boeing 747,

00:07:40.580 --> 00:07:44.939 align:middle line:10%
in a high crosswind on a rainy,
stormy day the very first time

00:07:44.939 --> 00:07:45.980 align:middle line:10%
when you're in the plane.

00:07:45.980 --> 00:07:48.620 align:middle line:10%
You'd like to know that
he's had this experience

00:07:48.620 --> 00:07:51.980 align:middle line:10%
and that he is trained
to do so in the past.

00:07:51.980 --> 00:07:54.830 align:middle line:84%
So this is the
value of simulations

00:07:54.830 --> 00:07:57.330 align:middle line:90%
as they are used today.

00:07:57.330 --> 00:08:00.680 align:middle line:84%
So with this in mind,
I want to go back

00:08:00.680 --> 00:08:04.400 align:middle line:84%
to the original question that
I asked only a few moments ago.

00:08:04.400 --> 00:08:08.420 align:middle line:84%
Are we in one of those
simulations right now,

00:08:08.420 --> 00:08:12.410 align:middle line:84%
in a massive simulation
the size of a universe?

00:08:12.410 --> 00:08:14.090 align:middle line:90%
And if we were--

00:08:14.090 --> 00:08:16.520 align:middle line:84%
let me ask you this--
would you know it?

00:08:16.520 --> 00:08:18.590 align:middle line:10%
Would you know the
difference between what

00:08:18.590 --> 00:08:23.150 align:middle line:10%
is called a base reality,
or a fundamental reality,

00:08:23.150 --> 00:08:25.670 align:middle line:10%
and a simulated or
a digital reality?

00:08:25.670 --> 00:08:29.090 align:middle line:10%
Is everything that we're seeing
happening in our everyday lives

00:08:29.090 --> 00:08:32.809 align:middle line:10%
a part of this simulation?

00:08:32.809 --> 00:08:37.850 align:middle line:84%
Well, the idea itself is
actually a new language

00:08:37.850 --> 00:08:41.900 align:middle line:84%
for something that we
have heard about and been

00:08:41.900 --> 00:08:46.640 align:middle line:84%
conditioned to think about
for a very, very long time.

00:08:46.640 --> 00:08:50.750 align:middle line:84%
To illustrate this, what I'd
like to do is share with you

00:08:50.750 --> 00:08:54.560 align:middle line:84%
the characteristics of a
simulation as we know it today.

00:08:54.560 --> 00:08:57.950 align:middle line:84%
And then let's go into one of
our most ancient and cherished

00:08:57.950 --> 00:09:02.960 align:middle line:84%
spiritual traditions, into the
mystical texts of our past.

00:09:02.960 --> 00:09:05.330 align:middle line:84%
And let's see what
they are describing

00:09:05.330 --> 00:09:08.810 align:middle line:84%
and how that description
parallels with the simulation

00:09:08.810 --> 00:09:10.220 align:middle line:90%
that we're seeing today.

00:09:10.220 --> 00:09:12.620 align:middle line:84%
I think you're going to find
this really interesting.

00:09:12.620 --> 00:09:15.130 align:middle line:84%
The characteristics
of a simulated world.

00:09:15.130 --> 00:09:18.620 align:middle line:84%
A simulation has a
place where it begins,

00:09:18.620 --> 00:09:22.340 align:middle line:84%
a definite beginning, and it
has a place where it ends.

00:09:22.340 --> 00:09:26.330 align:middle line:84%
And what happens in between
that beginning and the ending

00:09:26.330 --> 00:09:31.580 align:middle line:84%
is based on a mathematic
algorithm, a rhythm of cycles

00:09:31.580 --> 00:09:35.150 align:middle line:84%
in patterns that repeat
again and again and again

00:09:35.150 --> 00:09:36.830 align:middle line:90%
on different scales.

00:09:36.830 --> 00:09:42.260 align:middle line:84%
In a simulation, there are rules
that govern the simulation.

00:09:42.260 --> 00:09:46.580 align:middle line:84%
And the idea is that as the
people in the simulation

00:09:46.580 --> 00:09:48.920 align:middle line:84%
become more familiar
with the environment,

00:09:48.920 --> 00:09:52.370 align:middle line:84%
as they learn those
rules, life gets better.

00:09:52.370 --> 00:09:54.860 align:middle line:90%
They improve with practice.

00:09:54.860 --> 00:10:01.040 align:middle line:84%
In a simulation, users have
access to another reality that

00:10:01.040 --> 00:10:03.740 align:middle line:90%
is not within the simulation.

00:10:03.740 --> 00:10:06.440 align:middle line:84%
In a simulation,
the users always

00:10:06.440 --> 00:10:10.220 align:middle line:84%
have access to an
external reality

00:10:10.220 --> 00:10:12.720 align:middle line:84%
that they can tap
into for guidance

00:10:12.720 --> 00:10:15.860 align:middle line:84%
if they get into trouble or
if they need clarification.

00:10:15.860 --> 00:10:18.890 align:middle line:84%
They always have the
ability to communicate

00:10:18.890 --> 00:10:21.029 align:middle line:90%
beyond the simulation itself.

00:10:21.029 --> 00:10:22.820 align:middle line:84%
That's going to be
really important in just

00:10:22.820 --> 00:10:24.330 align:middle line:90%
a few minutes.

00:10:24.330 --> 00:10:27.680 align:middle line:84%
And in a simulation,
as I've just mentioned,

00:10:27.680 --> 00:10:32.370 align:middle line:84%
the user cannot tell the
simulation from the real world.

00:10:32.370 --> 00:10:37.280 align:middle line:84%
So these are the characteristics
of a modern simulation

00:10:37.280 --> 00:10:40.730 align:middle line:84%
as we know it today, as we
use them today typically.

00:10:40.730 --> 00:10:44.540 align:middle line:84%
Now with this in
mind, let's go back

00:10:44.540 --> 00:10:48.950 align:middle line:84%
and look at what our most
ancient and cherished

00:10:48.950 --> 00:10:52.730 align:middle line:84%
spiritual traditions from a
number of different religions

00:10:52.730 --> 00:10:56.180 align:middle line:84%
tell us about the
world that we live in.

00:10:56.180 --> 00:10:58.760 align:middle line:10%
They tell us almost
universally that our world has

00:10:58.760 --> 00:11:01.310 align:middle line:10%
a beginning-- and there are
different ideas about what that

00:11:01.310 --> 00:11:05.360 align:middle line:10%
beginning is, but there is
a clear beginning in every

00:11:05.360 --> 00:11:06.980 align:middle line:10%
religious tradition--

00:11:06.980 --> 00:11:10.280 align:middle line:10%
and that our world will have
an end, that it does not

00:11:10.280 --> 00:11:11.640 align:middle line:10%
continue forever.

00:11:11.640 --> 00:11:15.020 align:middle line:84%
That is almost a universal
truth throughout the religions.

00:11:15.020 --> 00:11:16.790 align:middle line:84%
And that the events
that are unfolding

00:11:16.790 --> 00:11:18.650 align:middle line:84%
between the beginning
and that end

00:11:18.650 --> 00:11:22.580 align:middle line:84%
are based on natural
rhythms and cycles.

00:11:22.580 --> 00:11:25.820 align:middle line:84%
Our most cherished
spiritual traditions tell us

00:11:25.820 --> 00:11:29.390 align:middle line:84%
that every life has a
beginning and every life

00:11:29.390 --> 00:11:30.580 align:middle line:90%
must have an end.

00:11:30.580 --> 00:11:32.270 align:middle line:90%
They are not perpetual.

00:11:32.270 --> 00:11:36.350 align:middle line:84%
They tell us that there are
rules to living in this world,

00:11:36.350 --> 00:11:40.080 align:middle line:84%
and that our lives will get
better as we learn those rules.

00:11:40.080 --> 00:11:42.320 align:middle line:84%
Now, there are different
interpretations

00:11:42.320 --> 00:11:44.850 align:middle line:84%
of those rules in
different traditions.

00:11:44.850 --> 00:11:46.880 align:middle line:84%
Some of them are as
common as the golden rule,

00:11:46.880 --> 00:11:48.980 align:middle line:84%
do unto others as you'd
have them do unto you.

00:11:48.980 --> 00:11:52.520 align:middle line:84%
Some of them are reflected
in the 10 Commandments

00:11:52.520 --> 00:11:55.640 align:middle line:84%
that tell us about how
to conduct our lives.

00:11:55.640 --> 00:11:57.580 align:middle line:84%
And then other
spiritual traditions,

00:11:57.580 --> 00:12:00.500 align:middle line:84%
in the shamanic traditions
and in the Egyptian mystical

00:12:00.500 --> 00:12:02.840 align:middle line:84%
traditions, they
all give us insights

00:12:02.840 --> 00:12:06.590 align:middle line:84%
into how we live our
lives in this world.

00:12:06.590 --> 00:12:08.330 align:middle line:90%
Here's the key.

00:12:08.330 --> 00:12:11.000 align:middle line:84%
Every ancient
spiritual tradition

00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:16.580 align:middle line:84%
tells us that beyond the
world of our everyday senses,

00:12:16.580 --> 00:12:20.930 align:middle line:84%
that we have direct access to
a guidance and a wisdom that

00:12:20.930 --> 00:12:22.670 align:middle line:90%
is not part of this world.

00:12:22.670 --> 00:12:27.740 align:middle line:84%
We have access to an external
reality or an external guide.

00:12:27.740 --> 00:12:29.540 align:middle line:84%
So when we make
these comparisons,

00:12:29.540 --> 00:12:32.890 align:middle line:84%
except for the language, you
can see the similarities.

00:12:32.890 --> 00:12:36.600 align:middle line:84%
Is it possible that
thousands of years ago,

00:12:36.600 --> 00:12:39.020 align:middle line:84%
our ancestors were
trying to inform us,

00:12:39.020 --> 00:12:42.500 align:middle line:84%
in a language of their time,
something that they understood

00:12:42.500 --> 00:12:45.500 align:middle line:84%
that we are only
beginning to awaken

00:12:45.500 --> 00:12:48.560 align:middle line:84%
to the possibility of
happening in our lives,

00:12:48.560 --> 00:12:51.550 align:middle line:84%
that we are actually
in an artificial world,

00:12:51.550 --> 00:12:54.350 align:middle line:84%
a temporary world that has
a beginning and an end,

00:12:54.350 --> 00:12:56.180 align:middle line:84%
that we're learning
something here,

00:12:56.180 --> 00:13:00.350 align:middle line:84%
and that we have access to
an external guidance when

00:13:00.350 --> 00:13:02.180 align:middle line:90%
we need that access.

00:13:02.180 --> 00:13:05.570 align:middle line:84%
We can't tell the real
from the illusion.

00:13:05.570 --> 00:13:08.660 align:middle line:84%
And as a matter of fact,
the Sanskrit word maya,

00:13:08.660 --> 00:13:13.010 align:middle line:84%
the word itself maya,
actually means illusion.

00:13:13.010 --> 00:13:17.210 align:middle line:84%
This is a fundamental concept
in the Hindu tradition.

00:13:17.210 --> 00:13:21.200 align:middle line:84%
And what I love about the Hindu
tradition is that they tell us

00:13:21.200 --> 00:13:25.920 align:middle line:84%
that it is under the illusion,
under maya's influence,

00:13:25.920 --> 00:13:31.010 align:middle line:84%
that the soul identifies with
the body to the point where we

00:13:31.010 --> 00:13:35.540 align:middle line:84%
cannot tell ourselves as
separate from the illusion

00:13:35.540 --> 00:13:36.620 align:middle line:90%
of this physical world.

00:13:36.620 --> 00:13:39.740 align:middle line:84%
Under maya's
influence, we get lost

00:13:39.740 --> 00:13:43.790 align:middle line:84%
in the body's expressions
of ego and fear, sex, race,

00:13:43.790 --> 00:13:45.800 align:middle line:84%
the color of our
skin, our belief

00:13:45.800 --> 00:13:48.700 align:middle line:84%
systems under the
illusion of maya.

00:13:48.700 --> 00:13:50.240 align:middle line:84%
And where this
gets really, really

00:13:50.240 --> 00:13:53.570 align:middle line:84%
interesting is in
those same traditions,

00:13:53.570 --> 00:13:57.410 align:middle line:84%
the idea of enlightenment
means to escape the maya,

00:13:57.410 --> 00:13:59.540 align:middle line:90%
to escape the illusion.

00:13:59.540 --> 00:14:01.370 align:middle line:84%
So if you watch the
movie "The Matrix",

00:14:01.370 --> 00:14:04.880 align:middle line:84%
the 1999 blockbuster
hit "The Matrix",

00:14:04.880 --> 00:14:06.920 align:middle line:84%
as we escape the
illusion of maya,

00:14:06.920 --> 00:14:10.010 align:middle line:84%
this would be the equivalent
of taking the red pill,

00:14:10.010 --> 00:14:14.450 align:middle line:84%
so of awakening to a
greater reality that

00:14:14.450 --> 00:14:17.990 align:middle line:84%
exists beyond the senses
of our everyday lives

00:14:17.990 --> 00:14:19.760 align:middle line:90%
or everyday world.

00:14:19.760 --> 00:14:22.430 align:middle line:10%
Christian traditions tell us
something very, very similar.

00:14:22.430 --> 00:14:25.130 align:middle line:84%
They tell us almost universally
this world is temporary,

00:14:25.130 --> 00:14:28.070 align:middle line:84%
that it is an illusion,
not to get stuck here,

00:14:28.070 --> 00:14:31.340 align:middle line:84%
that we're here only briefly,
and that we are preparing.

00:14:31.340 --> 00:14:33.740 align:middle line:84%
They actually say we're
preparing ourselves

00:14:33.740 --> 00:14:35.839 align:middle line:90%
to live in another world.

00:14:35.839 --> 00:14:38.130 align:middle line:84%
In the Christian traditions
it's called heaven or hell.

00:14:38.130 --> 00:14:41.820 align:middle line:84%
We can place whatever meaning
we choose to place on that.

00:14:41.820 --> 00:14:44.420 align:middle line:84%
But the idea is that
where we end up going

00:14:44.420 --> 00:14:48.920 align:middle line:84%
depends on how well we learn
the rules and the principles

00:14:48.920 --> 00:14:52.010 align:middle line:84%
of this world that
we're living in now.

00:14:52.010 --> 00:14:56.630 align:middle line:84%
This parallels the ideas of
a simulation almost to the t.

00:14:56.630 --> 00:15:01.730 align:middle line:84%
So as we learn to embrace things
like compassion, forgiveness,

00:15:01.730 --> 00:15:04.580 align:middle line:84%
the honoring of life,
things like that,

00:15:04.580 --> 00:15:08.909 align:middle line:84%
that prepares us to live
successfully in whatever world,

00:15:08.909 --> 00:15:10.450 align:middle line:84%
whatever environment
it is that we're

00:15:10.450 --> 00:15:13.090 align:middle line:90%
moving to beyond this world.

00:15:13.090 --> 00:15:15.280 align:middle line:84%
So we could go on
in other traditions,

00:15:15.280 --> 00:15:17.710 align:middle line:84%
and maybe you've done
this in your own life.

00:15:17.710 --> 00:15:19.210 align:middle line:90%
You can see the parallels.

00:15:19.210 --> 00:15:21.340 align:middle line:84%
The key here is that
in both the Hindu

00:15:21.340 --> 00:15:23.590 align:middle line:84%
and the Christian
traditions, we have

00:15:23.590 --> 00:15:26.530 align:middle line:84%
access to this
wisdom that is beyond

00:15:26.530 --> 00:15:30.550 align:middle line:84%
our immediate environment,
an external wisdom.

00:15:30.550 --> 00:15:32.950 align:middle line:84%
And I find this
fascinating because when

00:15:32.950 --> 00:15:36.760 align:middle line:84%
I look into the
artwork, for example,

00:15:36.760 --> 00:15:41.020 align:middle line:84%
of some of our most ancient
traditions, and I ask myself

00:15:41.020 --> 00:15:46.060 align:middle line:84%
how would they have portrayed
this idea visually 2000,

00:15:46.060 --> 00:15:48.340 align:middle line:90%
2,500 years ago?

00:15:48.340 --> 00:15:51.730 align:middle line:84%
And knowing what we now know
about the possibility of us

00:15:51.730 --> 00:15:54.250 align:middle line:84%
living in a simulation,
when we look at the artwork

00:15:54.250 --> 00:15:58.030 align:middle line:84%
and we see the prophets
from this world climbing

00:15:58.030 --> 00:16:00.550 align:middle line:84%
a ladder into the
cloud and the heavens

00:16:00.550 --> 00:16:03.400 align:middle line:84%
to communicate with
something beyond this world,

00:16:03.400 --> 00:16:05.470 align:middle line:84%
we have to ask, is this
what they're telling us?

00:16:05.470 --> 00:16:07.270 align:middle line:84%
Is this what they
are portraying?

00:16:07.270 --> 00:16:11.060 align:middle line:90%


00:16:11.060 --> 00:16:13.160 align:middle line:84%
So when we see the
artwork that was

00:16:13.160 --> 00:16:19.290 align:middle line:84%
left to us by our ancestors
2,000, 2,500 years ago,

00:16:19.290 --> 00:16:23.390 align:middle line:84%
within the context of what we
now know about simulations,

00:16:23.390 --> 00:16:27.170 align:middle line:84%
we have to ask, is this
what they were portraying?

00:16:27.170 --> 00:16:29.450 align:middle line:84%
Is this what they were
trying to tell us?

00:16:29.450 --> 00:16:31.680 align:middle line:84%
Were they depicting
in their artwork.

00:16:31.680 --> 00:16:34.250 align:middle line:84%
this relationship
between us and this world

00:16:34.250 --> 00:16:36.530 align:middle line:84%
and the ability to
transcend this world,

00:16:36.530 --> 00:16:41.180 align:middle line:84%
to access a wisdom, an
external source of wisdom,

00:16:41.180 --> 00:16:42.140 align:middle line:90%
in another world?

00:16:42.140 --> 00:16:44.570 align:middle line:84%
When we see them climbing
the ladders into the heavens,

00:16:44.570 --> 00:16:47.630 align:middle line:84%
for example, how else would
they have portrayed something

00:16:47.630 --> 00:16:48.960 align:middle line:90%
like that?

00:16:48.960 --> 00:16:51.020 align:middle line:84%
So these are all
things to consider

00:16:51.020 --> 00:16:53.960 align:middle line:84%
when we're talking
about this relationship

00:16:53.960 --> 00:16:56.900 align:middle line:84%
between an ancient
description of us living

00:16:56.900 --> 00:16:58.820 align:middle line:84%
in a temporary,
illusionary world,

00:16:58.820 --> 00:17:01.340 align:middle line:84%
and what the best science
of the modern world

00:17:01.340 --> 00:17:03.620 align:middle line:84%
is now telling us about
simulations and the way

00:17:03.620 --> 00:17:04.790 align:middle line:90%
they work.

00:17:04.790 --> 00:17:09.109 align:middle line:84%
There's a school of thought in
some scientific circles that

00:17:09.109 --> 00:17:15.190 align:middle line:84%
consciousness itself is in
constant dialogue with itself,

00:17:15.190 --> 00:17:17.690 align:middle line:84%
that consciousness is
constantly communicating

00:17:17.690 --> 00:17:21.380 align:middle line:84%
with itself, that we are
constantly communicating

00:17:21.380 --> 00:17:23.630 align:middle line:84%
with ourselves
through the things

00:17:23.630 --> 00:17:27.500 align:middle line:84%
that we create, through
our art, through our music,

00:17:27.500 --> 00:17:30.920 align:middle line:84%
through our movies, through
the books that we write.

00:17:30.920 --> 00:17:32.540 align:middle line:84%
And I personally
believe that there's

00:17:32.540 --> 00:17:34.760 align:middle line:84%
a lot of truth to
this line of thinking.

00:17:34.760 --> 00:17:38.420 align:middle line:84%
I believe that when we
create individually,

00:17:38.420 --> 00:17:43.190 align:middle line:84%
we are responding to an impulse,
a collective impulse that

00:17:43.190 --> 00:17:46.980 align:middle line:84%
comes to us from our
collective consciousness.

00:17:46.980 --> 00:17:51.530 align:middle line:84%
And if this is the case, it
suggests that we are constantly

00:17:51.530 --> 00:17:58.590 align:middle line:84%
informing ourselves of a reality
that we know, on some level,

00:17:58.590 --> 00:17:59.750 align:middle line:90%
is true.

00:17:59.750 --> 00:18:01.460 align:middle line:84%
And we are informing
ourselves so

00:18:01.460 --> 00:18:05.580 align:middle line:84%
that we can engage with that
reality on a conscious level.

00:18:05.580 --> 00:18:07.670 align:middle line:90%
Let me just give you an example.

00:18:07.670 --> 00:18:09.920 align:middle line:90%
Maybe you're a "Star Trek" fan.

00:18:09.920 --> 00:18:11.780 align:middle line:90%
I'm a huge "Star Trek" fan.

00:18:11.780 --> 00:18:16.250 align:middle line:84%
And in "Star Trek: The Next
Generation", the 13th episode

00:18:16.250 --> 00:18:20.120 align:middle line:84%
of the seventh season,
there is an amazing segment

00:18:20.120 --> 00:18:22.490 align:middle line:90%
that is titled "Homeward".

00:18:22.490 --> 00:18:25.880 align:middle line:84%
And it is a very,
very powerful story

00:18:25.880 --> 00:18:29.300 align:middle line:84%
that I believe illustrates
how powerful this idea

00:18:29.300 --> 00:18:31.341 align:middle line:90%
of a simulation really is.

00:18:31.341 --> 00:18:32.840 align:middle line:84%
Now if you're a
"Star Trek" fan, you

00:18:32.840 --> 00:18:35.930 align:middle line:84%
may know that aboard
the Starship Enterprise,

00:18:35.930 --> 00:18:38.840 align:middle line:84%
there's a special room
that is called a holodeck.

00:18:38.840 --> 00:18:43.430 align:middle line:84%
And in the holodeck, it
is possible to recreate

00:18:43.430 --> 00:18:47.090 align:middle line:84%
a simulation on the
ship of an environment

00:18:47.090 --> 00:18:48.560 align:middle line:84%
that the crew may
find themselves

00:18:48.560 --> 00:18:51.200 align:middle line:84%
in when they beam
down to another world

00:18:51.200 --> 00:18:53.090 align:middle line:84%
so that they can
master the parameters

00:18:53.090 --> 00:18:56.090 align:middle line:84%
and prepare themselves
for that environment.

00:18:56.090 --> 00:18:58.580 align:middle line:84%
That concept is going
to be very important

00:18:58.580 --> 00:19:00.630 align:middle line:90%
for this particular episode.

00:19:00.630 --> 00:19:02.780 align:middle line:10%
In this episode, the
Starship Enterprise

00:19:02.780 --> 00:19:05.150 align:middle line:10%
has gone to another
star system, and they've

00:19:05.150 --> 00:19:10.290 align:middle line:10%
found an Earth-like planet with
humans living on this planet.

00:19:10.290 --> 00:19:14.970 align:middle line:10%
However, the humans chose
a non-technological path

00:19:14.970 --> 00:19:15.770 align:middle line:10%
of progress.

00:19:15.770 --> 00:19:18.050 align:middle line:10%
They didn't become
a high tech society.

00:19:18.050 --> 00:19:20.750 align:middle line:10%
They became a very simple,
agricultural society.

00:19:20.750 --> 00:19:22.430 align:middle line:90%
They live close to the earth.

00:19:22.430 --> 00:19:25.490 align:middle line:84%
They raise their family,
they grow their food,

00:19:25.490 --> 00:19:27.380 align:middle line:90%
and they don't have disease.

00:19:27.380 --> 00:19:29.450 align:middle line:84%
They live to be
healthy old ages.

00:19:29.450 --> 00:19:31.670 align:middle line:84%
And it's a very
beautiful lifestyle.

00:19:31.670 --> 00:19:34.160 align:middle line:84%
But this is "Sar Trek", so
there has to be a catch.

00:19:34.160 --> 00:19:36.560 align:middle line:10%
And the catch is
that the solar system

00:19:36.560 --> 00:19:37.650 align:middle line:10%
is about to be destroyed.

00:19:37.650 --> 00:19:39.980 align:middle line:10%
The sun is going
to go supernova.

00:19:39.980 --> 00:19:42.500 align:middle line:10%
It's going to explode, and
this planet will be destroyed,

00:19:42.500 --> 00:19:44.880 align:middle line:10%
and all the lives will be lost.

00:19:44.880 --> 00:19:47.000 align:middle line:84%
The crew of the
Enterprise find themselves

00:19:47.000 --> 00:19:50.390 align:middle line:84%
in this very awkward
position because their job

00:19:50.390 --> 00:19:54.410 align:middle line:84%
is to observe and not to
interfere with any form of life

00:19:54.410 --> 00:19:55.590 align:middle line:90%
they find, on the one hand.

00:19:55.590 --> 00:19:58.640 align:middle line:10%
On the other hand, these
are humans on this planet,

00:19:58.640 --> 00:20:01.880 align:middle line:10%
and they don't want
to see them all die.

00:20:01.880 --> 00:20:05.840 align:middle line:10%
So they find a very interesting
and innovative solution.

00:20:05.840 --> 00:20:07.310 align:middle line:90%
What they do is this.

00:20:07.310 --> 00:20:10.850 align:middle line:10%
When the people on the
planet go to sleep at night,

00:20:10.850 --> 00:20:15.380 align:middle line:10%
they are beamed, in their
sleep, aboard the Starship

00:20:15.380 --> 00:20:20.240 align:middle line:10%
into a recreation of their
world in the holodeck

00:20:20.240 --> 00:20:24.470 align:middle line:10%
of the Starship, a simulation
on the Starship that they cannot

00:20:24.470 --> 00:20:27.050 align:middle line:10%
tell from the real world
that they're living in.

00:20:27.050 --> 00:20:30.440 align:middle line:84%
And the idea is that once
they're all there safely,

00:20:30.440 --> 00:20:34.694 align:middle line:84%
that the crew will take this
population to another planet

00:20:34.694 --> 00:20:36.860 align:middle line:84%
that looks just like their
own, beam them back down,

00:20:36.860 --> 00:20:38.510 align:middle line:84%
and they'll never
know what happened.

00:20:38.510 --> 00:20:43.709 align:middle line:84%
So they've met all the criteria
of the Starship mission.

00:20:43.709 --> 00:20:45.500 align:middle line:84%
They have saved the
life, yet they have not

00:20:45.500 --> 00:20:47.000 align:middle line:90%
interfered in the process.

00:20:47.000 --> 00:20:50.390 align:middle line:84%
Well, this wouldn't
be a "Sar Trek"

00:20:50.390 --> 00:20:52.220 align:middle line:90%
if something didn't go wrong.

00:20:52.220 --> 00:20:54.530 align:middle line:10%
And what goes wrong in
this particular episode

00:20:54.530 --> 00:20:58.700 align:middle line:10%
is that the power system on
the Enterprise breaks down,

00:20:58.700 --> 00:21:01.325 align:middle line:10%
and the simulation
begins to break down

00:21:01.325 --> 00:21:03.560 align:middle line:10%
that the people are
living in, and they

00:21:03.560 --> 00:21:07.430 align:middle line:10%
see their virtual world
begin to dissolve.

00:21:07.430 --> 00:21:11.260 align:middle line:84%
And the rest of the episode
is a very heartfelt episode

00:21:11.260 --> 00:21:14.650 align:middle line:84%
of humans communicating
with humans honestly

00:21:14.650 --> 00:21:18.170 align:middle line:84%
about what their intent was,
and where they come from,

00:21:18.170 --> 00:21:20.170 align:middle line:84%
and why they've done
what they've done.

00:21:20.170 --> 00:21:22.180 align:middle line:10%
The point of me
sharing this story

00:21:22.180 --> 00:21:24.970 align:middle line:10%
is that the people on the
surface of that planet, when

00:21:24.970 --> 00:21:27.250 align:middle line:10%
they found themselves
in the holodeck, they

00:21:27.250 --> 00:21:30.310 align:middle line:10%
could not tell the difference
between that holodeck

00:21:30.310 --> 00:21:32.650 align:middle line:10%
and the world that
they are living in.

00:21:32.650 --> 00:21:36.250 align:middle line:10%
And the question is,
is this our story?

00:21:36.250 --> 00:21:37.870 align:middle line:10%
Are we already there?

00:21:37.870 --> 00:21:41.500 align:middle line:10%
Is consciousness
informing us, reminding

00:21:41.500 --> 00:21:44.230 align:middle line:10%
us of the truth
of our existence,

00:21:44.230 --> 00:21:47.110 align:middle line:10%
through our artistic
creations, that we

00:21:47.110 --> 00:21:49.540 align:middle line:10%
are living in this simulation?

00:21:49.540 --> 00:21:52.720 align:middle line:84%
And if it is, what
is it saying to us?

00:21:52.720 --> 00:21:55.930 align:middle line:84%
What are we asking
ourselves to remember?

00:21:55.930 --> 00:22:01.270 align:middle line:84%
If consciousness is informing
itself through the art,

00:22:01.270 --> 00:22:04.630 align:middle line:84%
maybe the theme of the
art is reminding us

00:22:04.630 --> 00:22:07.390 align:middle line:84%
of the deepest truths
of our existence.

00:22:07.390 --> 00:22:10.810 align:middle line:10%
Look at the films that are
so popular right now things,

00:22:10.810 --> 00:22:13.900 align:middle line:10%
like "The Matrix" that I
just mentioned, or "Avatar".

00:22:13.900 --> 00:22:17.950 align:middle line:84%
Both of these hugely popular
films, they touch something

00:22:17.950 --> 00:22:21.460 align:middle line:84%
so deep within
individuals, something

00:22:21.460 --> 00:22:24.970 align:middle line:84%
that so many people said
was so familiar to them.

00:22:24.970 --> 00:22:27.130 align:middle line:84%
Some people actually
cried when they

00:22:27.130 --> 00:22:30.340 align:middle line:84%
were watching these films
because it touched an element

00:22:30.340 --> 00:22:32.200 align:middle line:90%
of truth within them.

00:22:32.200 --> 00:22:35.650 align:middle line:84%
In both of these films, there
are artificial environments,

00:22:35.650 --> 00:22:41.560 align:middle line:84%
simulations where humans are
projected into lifelike bodies

00:22:41.560 --> 00:22:44.110 align:middle line:84%
just like we have right
now so that they can

00:22:44.110 --> 00:22:46.030 align:middle line:90%
interact in these environments.

00:22:46.030 --> 00:22:48.830 align:middle line:84%
The question is, are
we already there?

00:22:48.830 --> 00:22:52.090 align:middle line:84%
If you were living in a
simulated environment,

00:22:52.090 --> 00:22:53.750 align:middle line:90%
would you even know it?

00:22:53.750 --> 00:22:55.600 align:middle line:90%
And how would you know it?

00:22:55.600 --> 00:23:00.340 align:middle line:84%
Can you tell a simulation
from a base environment?

00:23:00.340 --> 00:23:02.950 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to show you a couple
of images on your screen,

00:23:02.950 --> 00:23:04.870 align:middle line:84%
and I'm going to
ask you if you can

00:23:04.870 --> 00:23:06.850 align:middle line:84%
tell the difference
between these

00:23:06.850 --> 00:23:09.850 align:middle line:90%
and an artificial environment.

00:23:09.850 --> 00:23:11.800 align:middle line:84%
What you're looking at
now is a mountain range

00:23:11.800 --> 00:23:13.240 align:middle line:90%
covered with snow.

00:23:13.240 --> 00:23:15.140 align:middle line:90%
How real does this look to you?

00:23:15.140 --> 00:23:16.630 align:middle line:90%
Is this an artist's rendition?

00:23:16.630 --> 00:23:18.910 align:middle line:90%
Is it a digital reality?

00:23:18.910 --> 00:23:22.030 align:middle line:10%
I'm going to tell you right
now this is a simulated image.

00:23:22.030 --> 00:23:24.250 align:middle line:10%
It is a virtual image.

00:23:24.250 --> 00:23:26.390 align:middle line:10%
The same with this,
another mountain range.

00:23:26.390 --> 00:23:28.700 align:middle line:10%
It's doing exactly
the same thing.

00:23:28.700 --> 00:23:29.500 align:middle line:10%
Looks real.

00:23:29.500 --> 00:23:31.060 align:middle line:10%
It looks like a photograph.

00:23:31.060 --> 00:23:32.900 align:middle line:10%
You cannot tell it
from a photograph.

00:23:32.900 --> 00:23:35.740 align:middle line:10%
This is a digital reality.

00:23:35.740 --> 00:23:37.570 align:middle line:10%
Look how real this looks.

00:23:37.570 --> 00:23:39.850 align:middle line:10%
Look at the vegetation,
look at the sky,

00:23:39.850 --> 00:23:42.310 align:middle line:10%
look at the texture
of the rocks.

00:23:42.310 --> 00:23:44.890 align:middle line:10%
If you didn't know that
this was a digital reality,

00:23:44.890 --> 00:23:47.440 align:middle line:10%
you would not be able to tell
this from the real thing.

00:23:47.440 --> 00:23:50.350 align:middle line:10%
This is the African Savannah
is what you're seeing

00:23:50.350 --> 00:23:52.910 align:middle line:10%
on your screen right now.

00:23:52.910 --> 00:23:53.710 align:middle line:10%
Look at the trees.

00:23:53.710 --> 00:23:56.050 align:middle line:10%
Look at the leaves on the trees.

00:23:56.050 --> 00:24:00.070 align:middle line:10%
We cannot tell these
images from the real thing.

00:24:00.070 --> 00:24:02.350 align:middle line:10%
To us, these look real.

00:24:02.350 --> 00:24:05.050 align:middle line:10%
And that's the point where
we're going with this.

00:24:05.050 --> 00:24:07.360 align:middle line:10%
Scientists now are
beginning to take

00:24:07.360 --> 00:24:13.700 align:middle line:10%
the possibility of us living
in a simulation very seriously.

00:24:13.700 --> 00:24:15.850 align:middle line:84%
So seriously, in
fact, that they're

00:24:15.850 --> 00:24:19.030 align:middle line:84%
designing entire
scientific projects

00:24:19.030 --> 00:24:24.010 align:middle line:84%
to determine whether or not
this is, in fact, the case.

00:24:24.010 --> 00:24:27.140 align:middle line:10%
John Barrow is an Oxford
University physicist.

00:24:27.140 --> 00:24:31.350 align:middle line:10%
He's also a 2006
Templeton Award Laureate.

00:24:31.350 --> 00:24:36.190 align:middle line:10%
And I want you to listen to what
he said in a quote for a paper

00:24:36.190 --> 00:24:37.656 align:middle line:10%
that he was writing.

00:24:37.656 --> 00:24:38.530 align:middle line:90%
What he said is this.

00:24:38.530 --> 00:24:41.290 align:middle line:10%
He said, "It has
long been recognized

00:24:41.290 --> 00:24:43.780 align:middle line:10%
that technological
civilizations, only

00:24:43.780 --> 00:24:46.470 align:middle line:10%
a little more
advanced than ours,

00:24:46.470 --> 00:24:51.100 align:middle line:10%
will have the capacity
to simulate universes

00:24:51.100 --> 00:24:55.030 align:middle line:10%
in which self-conscious entities
can emerge and communicate

00:24:55.030 --> 00:24:56.960 align:middle line:10%
with one another."

00:24:56.960 --> 00:24:59.620 align:middle line:10%
Look at what John
Barrow has said.

00:24:59.620 --> 00:25:03.010 align:middle line:10%
What he's saying is
technological civilizations

00:25:03.010 --> 00:25:05.130 align:middle line:10%
will have this capability.

00:25:05.130 --> 00:25:07.690 align:middle line:10%
And the reason this
is important to us

00:25:07.690 --> 00:25:10.780 align:middle line:10%
is because the best
science of the modern world

00:25:10.780 --> 00:25:13.600 align:middle line:10%
is now changing the
way we have been

00:25:13.600 --> 00:25:16.330 align:middle line:10%
taught to think about
ourselves and our relationship

00:25:16.330 --> 00:25:17.650 align:middle line:10%
to the Earth.

00:25:17.650 --> 00:25:21.610 align:middle line:84%
When I was in school back
in the 1950s, 60s, and 70s,

00:25:21.610 --> 00:25:24.670 align:middle line:84%
I was taught that
civilization is linear,

00:25:24.670 --> 00:25:27.490 align:middle line:84%
that civilization
began about 5,000,

00:25:27.490 --> 00:25:31.960 align:middle line:84%
maybe 5,500 years ago, during
the time of ancient Sumeria,

00:25:31.960 --> 00:25:36.850 align:middle line:84%
it began relatively primitive,
and that civilization

00:25:36.850 --> 00:25:42.280 align:middle line:84%
accelerated in a linear
fashion from the less developed

00:25:42.280 --> 00:25:45.910 align:middle line:84%
to the more complex
so that we are

00:25:45.910 --> 00:25:48.460 align:middle line:90%
the pinnacle of sophistication.

00:25:48.460 --> 00:25:52.159 align:middle line:84%
We are the highest form of
technological advancement

00:25:52.159 --> 00:25:53.950 align:middle line:84%
that has ever graced
the face of the Earth.

00:25:53.950 --> 00:25:56.920 align:middle line:84%
This is what you and I have
been taught, on the one hand.

00:25:56.920 --> 00:25:59.890 align:middle line:84%
And on the other hand,
there's a growing body

00:25:59.890 --> 00:26:03.730 align:middle line:84%
of peer reviewed scientific
evidence that's telling us

00:26:03.730 --> 00:26:04.640 align:middle line:90%
this is not the case.

00:26:04.640 --> 00:26:07.760 align:middle line:84%
The evidence no longer
supports that story.

00:26:07.760 --> 00:26:09.280 align:middle line:84%
And when I say peer
reviewed, I want

00:26:09.280 --> 00:26:11.730 align:middle line:84%
to be very clear
what I mean by this

00:26:11.730 --> 00:26:14.640 align:middle line:84%
because I'm going to
reference peer reviewed work

00:26:14.640 --> 00:26:17.310 align:middle line:90%
through the rest of this series.

00:26:17.310 --> 00:26:20.220 align:middle line:84%
A peer reviewed
paper is a paper that

00:26:20.220 --> 00:26:22.230 align:middle line:84%
has been written by
a single scientist

00:26:22.230 --> 00:26:24.150 align:middle line:90%
or maybe a group of scientists.

00:26:24.150 --> 00:26:27.450 align:middle line:84%
And after it is written,
before it is published,

00:26:27.450 --> 00:26:31.770 align:middle line:84%
it is circulated among peers,
hence the term peer reviewed,

00:26:31.770 --> 00:26:34.530 align:middle line:84%
other scientists who
have the opportunity

00:26:34.530 --> 00:26:37.110 align:middle line:84%
to look at the paper,
look at the research,

00:26:37.110 --> 00:26:41.550 align:middle line:84%
try to find errors, try to find
where the evidence breaks down

00:26:41.550 --> 00:26:43.230 align:middle line:84%
or where it is
actually supported

00:26:43.230 --> 00:26:44.980 align:middle line:90%
with current research.

00:26:44.980 --> 00:26:47.320 align:middle line:84%
This is a process
that can take months.

00:26:47.320 --> 00:26:48.690 align:middle line:90%
It can take years.

00:26:48.690 --> 00:26:52.110 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes it'll take six
to eight years for a paper

00:26:52.110 --> 00:26:54.510 align:middle line:84%
to go through a
peer review process

00:26:54.510 --> 00:26:57.510 align:middle line:84%
before it is finally
accepted and published

00:26:57.510 --> 00:27:00.620 align:middle line:84%
in a peer reviewed scientific
journal such as "Nature",

00:27:00.620 --> 00:27:01.420 align:middle line:90%
for example.

00:27:01.420 --> 00:27:04.170 align:middle line:84%
"Nature" is a very
prestigious peer

00:27:04.170 --> 00:27:07.320 align:middle line:84%
reviewed scientific journal in
the contemporary world today,

00:27:07.320 --> 00:27:09.540 align:middle line:84%
and it is available
for the lay person

00:27:09.540 --> 00:27:11.850 align:middle line:84%
to catch up on all
of the new science.

00:27:11.850 --> 00:27:15.330 align:middle line:84%
So the point of me
making that description

00:27:15.330 --> 00:27:18.990 align:middle line:84%
is that peer reviewed
science is now

00:27:18.990 --> 00:27:23.780 align:middle line:84%
telling us that what we have
thought of our civilization

00:27:23.780 --> 00:27:27.270 align:middle line:84%
and of our history in the
past is no longer supported

00:27:27.270 --> 00:27:28.080 align:middle line:90%
by the evidence.

00:27:28.080 --> 00:27:32.550 align:middle line:84%
Now we know that
civilization is not linear.

00:27:32.550 --> 00:27:35.670 align:middle line:84%
We did not begin in a
single primitive state

00:27:35.670 --> 00:27:39.480 align:middle line:84%
and develop in a straight
line, in a linear fashion,

00:27:39.480 --> 00:27:40.930 align:middle line:90%
to the point we are today.

00:27:40.930 --> 00:27:44.520 align:middle line:90%
Rather, civilization is cyclic.

00:27:44.520 --> 00:27:49.080 align:middle line:84%
And the evidence is very
clear that this civilization,

00:27:49.080 --> 00:27:53.010 align:middle line:84%
as we know it, has occurred
within cycles that average

00:27:53.010 --> 00:27:55.470 align:middle line:90%
about 5,000 years apiece.

00:27:55.470 --> 00:27:57.420 align:middle line:84%
This is reflected
in the traditions

00:27:57.420 --> 00:27:59.460 align:middle line:84%
that we see in the
Mesoamerican calendars.

00:27:59.460 --> 00:28:02.860 align:middle line:84%
For example, the
ancient Maya had very,

00:28:02.860 --> 00:28:06.750 align:middle line:84%
very clear mathematical
representations of these

00:28:06.750 --> 00:28:10.900 align:middle line:84%
5,000-year cycles, how
they begin, how they end,

00:28:10.900 --> 00:28:15.370 align:middle line:84%
and what they mean to us today,
as have other civilizations.

00:28:15.370 --> 00:28:18.540 align:middle line:84%
So the reason I'm
sharing this with you

00:28:18.540 --> 00:28:23.460 align:middle line:84%
is that the idea that we
are the first technological

00:28:23.460 --> 00:28:27.150 align:middle line:84%
civilization, advanced
technological civilization,

00:28:27.150 --> 00:28:29.270 align:middle line:84%
is no longer supported
by the evidence.

00:28:29.270 --> 00:28:31.770 align:middle line:84%
I described some of
these civilizations

00:28:31.770 --> 00:28:33.911 align:middle line:84%
in the first season
of "Missing Links"

00:28:33.911 --> 00:28:35.910 align:middle line:84%
if you'd like to go back
and take a look at some

00:28:35.910 --> 00:28:37.870 align:middle line:90%
of those in more detail.

00:28:37.870 --> 00:28:40.060 align:middle line:84%
But what John
Barrow is saying is

00:28:40.060 --> 00:28:44.340 align:middle line:84%
it's long been recognized that
technological civilizations

00:28:44.340 --> 00:28:46.970 align:middle line:84%
only a little more
advanced than ours

00:28:46.970 --> 00:28:51.850 align:middle line:84%
will have this tremendous
computing capacity.

00:28:51.850 --> 00:28:54.780 align:middle line:84%
So when we now look
back into our past,

00:28:54.780 --> 00:28:57.270 align:middle line:84%
we have to ask the
question, is it possible,

00:28:57.270 --> 00:29:00.300 align:middle line:84%
is it possible that
there have been

00:29:00.300 --> 00:29:04.230 align:middle line:84%
highly advanced technological
civilizations in the past that

00:29:04.230 --> 00:29:08.370 align:middle line:84%
followed a path similar to
ours, and perhaps even advanced

00:29:08.370 --> 00:29:10.590 align:middle line:90%
beyond where we are today?

00:29:10.590 --> 00:29:13.200 align:middle line:84%
Is it possible that it
happened here on Earth?

00:29:13.200 --> 00:29:16.200 align:middle line:84%
Is it possible that it's
happened in other places?

00:29:16.200 --> 00:29:19.920 align:middle line:10%
And the reason this is
such a powerful question is

00:29:19.920 --> 00:29:22.920 align:middle line:10%
because, as I mentioned earlier,
when we look at the simulations

00:29:22.920 --> 00:29:25.890 align:middle line:10%
that we saw in the beginning of
this episode and how real they

00:29:25.890 --> 00:29:30.240 align:middle line:10%
are, and how difficult it is
to tell the simulation from

00:29:30.240 --> 00:29:32.190 align:middle line:10%
the real world-- when
you saw Michael Jackson,

00:29:32.190 --> 00:29:35.790 align:middle line:10%
if you did not know that he
had already died in 2009,

00:29:35.790 --> 00:29:38.460 align:middle line:10%
if you were in that audience
and you were seeing that,

00:29:38.460 --> 00:29:40.620 align:middle line:10%
and prior to that time
you'd been on a deserted,

00:29:40.620 --> 00:29:44.310 align:middle line:10%
remote desert island somewhere
and never got the message that

00:29:44.310 --> 00:29:46.410 align:middle line:10%
Michael Jackson had passed--

00:29:46.410 --> 00:29:48.450 align:middle line:10%
how would you have
known that that

00:29:48.450 --> 00:29:50.620 align:middle line:10%
was a digital representation?

00:29:50.620 --> 00:29:52.440 align:middle line:10%
You probably wouldn't have.

00:29:52.440 --> 00:29:55.920 align:middle line:84%
So the question that the
scientists now are asking--

00:29:55.920 --> 00:30:00.900 align:middle line:84%
as we embrace the deep
truth of cyclic civilization

00:30:00.900 --> 00:30:05.430 align:middle line:84%
and cyclic civilizations that
go back 15,000 or 20,000 years

00:30:05.430 --> 00:30:08.040 align:middle line:90%
or more before the present--

00:30:08.040 --> 00:30:12.750 align:middle line:84%
is it possible that those
civilizations developed in ways

00:30:12.750 --> 00:30:15.120 align:middle line:84%
that we simply
have not recognized

00:30:15.120 --> 00:30:18.930 align:middle line:84%
in the current world, that we're
only now beginning to entertain

00:30:18.930 --> 00:30:21.960 align:middle line:90%
the possibility of recognizing?

00:30:21.960 --> 00:30:25.860 align:middle line:84%
And this is one of those places
where the evidence is emerging,

00:30:25.860 --> 00:30:28.590 align:middle line:84%
but there is a reluctance--
and I have to be very honest

00:30:28.590 --> 00:30:32.160 align:middle line:84%
and say there's actually a
resistance, in some places,

00:30:32.160 --> 00:30:33.580 align:middle line:90%
to sharing the new discoveries.

00:30:33.580 --> 00:30:36.720 align:middle line:84%
There's a resistance in
mainstream classrooms,

00:30:36.720 --> 00:30:40.530 align:middle line:84%
in mainstream textbooks, to talk
about cyclic civilization going

00:30:40.530 --> 00:30:43.440 align:middle line:84%
back 15,000 years
before present.

00:30:43.440 --> 00:30:45.820 align:middle line:84%
We're certainly not seeing
in the documentaries

00:30:45.820 --> 00:30:50.100 align:middle line:84%
and the television specials,
with rare exceptions.

00:30:50.100 --> 00:30:52.740 align:middle line:84%
That's why it's important for
me to share this information

00:30:52.740 --> 00:30:55.250 align:middle line:90%
and talk to you about it here.

00:30:55.250 --> 00:30:56.230 align:middle line:90%
I'm a scientist.

00:30:56.230 --> 00:30:58.020 align:middle line:90%
I'm a degreed geologist.

00:30:58.020 --> 00:31:00.360 align:middle line:90%
And I think science is good.

00:31:00.360 --> 00:31:01.530 align:middle line:90%
Science serves us.

00:31:01.530 --> 00:31:05.820 align:middle line:84%
But science is designed
to be constantly updated

00:31:05.820 --> 00:31:07.320 align:middle line:90%
as new information emerges.

00:31:07.320 --> 00:31:09.070 align:middle line:90%
Science is not static.

00:31:09.070 --> 00:31:10.340 align:middle line:90%
And this is what's happened.

00:31:10.340 --> 00:31:11.840 align:middle line:84%
In many respects,
science has been

00:31:11.840 --> 00:31:16.080 align:middle line:84%
hijacked by other interests,
by corporations, by politics,

00:31:16.080 --> 00:31:17.420 align:middle line:90%
by religion.

00:31:17.420 --> 00:31:20.030 align:middle line:84%
So the science that
we've asked to serve us

00:31:20.030 --> 00:31:22.270 align:middle line:84%
can only serve us if
we keep it honest.

00:31:22.270 --> 00:31:24.980 align:middle line:84%
And what the science is
honestly saying to us

00:31:24.980 --> 00:31:30.290 align:middle line:84%
is that the world of the past is
very, very different from what

00:31:30.290 --> 00:31:31.970 align:middle line:90%
we've been led to believe.

00:31:31.970 --> 00:31:34.370 align:middle line:84%
There have been advanced
technological civilizations.

00:31:34.370 --> 00:31:35.600 align:middle line:90%
We knew they had electricity.

00:31:35.600 --> 00:31:37.430 align:middle line:90%
We've seen the buried cables.

00:31:37.430 --> 00:31:39.260 align:middle line:84%
We've seen the
pipes underground.

00:31:39.260 --> 00:31:41.450 align:middle line:84%
We've seen the civilizations
with hot and cold

00:31:41.450 --> 00:31:44.570 align:middle line:84%
running water, stained
glass windows, high art,

00:31:44.570 --> 00:31:47.540 align:middle line:84%
advanced mathematics,
knowledge of star systems

00:31:47.540 --> 00:31:50.730 align:middle line:84%
that we only had in
the 20th century.

00:31:50.730 --> 00:31:53.300 align:middle line:84%
And we're looking at
civilizations over 10,000 years

00:31:53.300 --> 00:31:55.280 align:middle line:90%
old that had this knowledge.

00:31:55.280 --> 00:32:00.480 align:middle line:84%
So I'm saying all of this now
to come back to the question,

00:32:00.480 --> 00:32:04.040 align:middle line:84%
is it possible that as
advanced civilization,

00:32:04.040 --> 00:32:10.890 align:middle line:84%
maybe ours, has developed
simulated realities a long time

00:32:10.890 --> 00:32:14.910 align:middle line:84%
ago for reasons that we'll
explore in this series?

00:32:14.910 --> 00:32:18.650 align:middle line:84%
And if so, is it possible
that we are living inside

00:32:18.650 --> 00:32:21.090 align:middle line:90%
of those realities?

00:32:21.090 --> 00:32:24.260 align:middle line:84%
So now that we've defined the
forbidden question of what

00:32:24.260 --> 00:32:29.250 align:middle line:84%
a simulated reality is and we've
explored why it's important,

00:32:29.250 --> 00:32:30.690 align:middle line:84%
let's take a look
at the evidence.

00:32:30.690 --> 00:32:32.970 align:middle line:90%
Let's see what it's telling us.

00:32:32.970 --> 00:32:35.180 align:middle line:84%

we'll see the results

of the very first

fact, living in a computer

00:32:41.900 --> 00:32:42.911 align:middle line:90%
