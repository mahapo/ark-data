[THEME MUSIC]

00:00:07.840 --> 00:00:24.500 align:middle line:90%


00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:27.790 align:middle line:84%
>> Welcome to a special
series of Missing Links,

00:00:27.790 --> 00:00:29.890 align:middle line:84%
where your questions
get answered.

00:00:29.890 --> 00:00:32.110 align:middle line:10%
I'm your host, Tiffany
Bush, and I'm also

00:00:32.110 --> 00:00:34.600 align:middle line:10%
the head of the Member
Support Team here at Gaia.

00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:37.866 align:middle line:84%
And with me today is the star
of the show, Gregg Braden.

00:00:37.866 --> 00:00:40.240 align:middle line:10%
We're here to answer your
questions from the first season

00:00:40.240 --> 00:00:41.590 align:middle line:10%
of Missing Links.

00:00:41.590 --> 00:00:45.230 align:middle line:84%
Today, we'll look at climate
change and our genetic code.

00:00:45.230 --> 00:00:46.090 align:middle line:90%
Welcome, Gregg.

00:00:46.090 --> 00:00:47.340 align:middle line:90%
>> Tiffany, thank you so much.

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:49.585 align:middle line:84%
I've been waiting my
whole life for this day.

00:00:49.585 --> 00:00:50.420 align:middle line:90%
>> Love it.

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:51.880 align:middle line:90%
>> I'm so excited to be here.

00:00:51.880 --> 00:00:56.050 align:middle line:84%
And I'm really excited
that our members have

00:00:56.050 --> 00:00:59.020 align:middle line:84%
felt moved to ask the
questions based on what we've

00:00:59.020 --> 00:01:00.595 align:middle line:90%
shared in this first season.

00:01:00.595 --> 00:01:04.360 align:middle line:84%
The first season, I
think, laid the foundation

00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:07.840 align:middle line:84%
for new information based
on peer-reviewed science

00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:10.330 align:middle line:84%
that simply is not showing
up in mainstream media.

00:01:10.330 --> 00:01:12.430 align:middle line:84%
So the fact they're
asking the questions

00:01:12.430 --> 00:01:15.117 align:middle line:84%
tells me that what we shared
was meaningful to them.

00:01:15.117 --> 00:01:16.450 align:middle line:90%
And I couldn't ask for any more.

00:01:16.450 --> 00:01:17.515 align:middle line:90%
I'm excited to be here today.

00:01:17.515 --> 00:01:17.770 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:01:17.770 --> 00:01:19.640 align:middle line:84%
>> Yes, thank you
so much for coming.

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:24.160 align:middle line:84%
I love that you said not being
shared in mainstream education.

00:01:24.160 --> 00:01:26.014 align:middle line:84%
One member of my
team, Joe, actually

00:01:26.014 --> 00:01:28.180 align:middle line:84%
was like, this goes against
everything I've learned,

00:01:28.180 --> 00:01:29.380 align:middle line:90%
on the very first episode.

00:01:29.380 --> 00:01:30.860 align:middle line:90%
So happy to be here.

00:01:30.860 --> 00:01:34.417 align:middle line:84%
Happy to hear your feedback
and to share the questions

00:01:34.417 --> 00:01:35.875 align:middle line:84%
that we've gotten
from the members.

00:01:35.875 --> 00:01:36.675 align:middle line:90%
>> Sure.

00:01:36.675 --> 00:01:38.890 align:middle line:84%
>> The first one will
be from Brenda H.

00:01:38.890 --> 00:01:41.860 align:middle line:84%
She wants to know if you
can address the climate

00:01:41.860 --> 00:01:42.730 align:middle line:90%
engineering.

00:01:42.730 --> 00:01:44.020 align:middle line:90%
What's happening there?

00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:46.390 align:middle line:84%
And is it a contributor
to the acceleration

00:01:46.390 --> 00:01:48.415 align:middle line:84%
and extreme effects
around the world?

00:01:48.415 --> 00:01:51.640 align:middle line:84%
>> Climate engineering, that
term covers a lot of ground.

00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:54.190 align:middle line:84%
Often, when people ask
about climate engineering,

00:01:54.190 --> 00:01:55.900 align:middle line:90%
that's code for chemtrails.

00:01:55.900 --> 00:01:58.870 align:middle line:84%
It's something that
they talk about.

00:01:58.870 --> 00:02:01.510 align:middle line:84%
The fact is that we
have been engineering

00:02:01.510 --> 00:02:04.450 align:middle line:84%
the climate for hundreds
of years in the ways

00:02:04.450 --> 00:02:06.490 align:middle line:90%
that we knew how at the time.

00:02:06.490 --> 00:02:09.310 align:middle line:84%
I remember when I was a
kid back in 1950s and '60s,

00:02:09.310 --> 00:02:13.270 align:middle line:84%
something called cloud seeding
was happening in the Midwest,

00:02:13.270 --> 00:02:15.760 align:middle line:84%
I was born and raised
in northern Missouri,

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:18.640 align:middle line:84%
to create rain in
times of drought,

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:22.630 align:middle line:84%
where the planes would spray
some kind of an iodine pellets,

00:02:22.630 --> 00:02:24.120 align:middle line:90%
or sometimes dry ice.

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:25.990 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes, they
even used propane.

00:02:25.990 --> 00:02:29.290 align:middle line:84%
In the upper atmosphere,
there's something

00:02:29.290 --> 00:02:33.220 align:middle line:84%
there for the humidity
to form a nucleus around

00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:34.720 align:middle line:84%
so that the cloud
droplets can fall.

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:37.630 align:middle line:84%
So the idea itself,
and it also falls

00:02:37.630 --> 00:02:40.000 align:middle line:84%
under the category
of geoengineering,

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:42.550 align:middle line:84%
are we geoengineering
our planet?

00:02:42.550 --> 00:02:44.200 align:middle line:90%
So all of these come together.

00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:45.699 align:middle line:84%
I'm just going to
lay them out right

00:02:45.699 --> 00:02:47.560 align:middle line:90%
now so we can tie into them.

00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:48.830 align:middle line:90%
The question, are we doing it?

00:02:48.830 --> 00:02:49.630 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

00:02:49.630 --> 00:02:50.546 align:middle line:90%
Have we been doing it?

00:02:50.546 --> 00:02:52.820 align:middle line:90%
Yes we have, for quite a while.

00:02:52.820 --> 00:02:54.400 align:middle line:84%
However, when I get
these questions,

00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:59.230 align:middle line:84%
my sense is that they're
more about the controversy

00:02:59.230 --> 00:03:01.900 align:middle line:90%
of chemtrails.

00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:04.660 align:middle line:84%
Are they happening, who's
doing it, what does it mean?

00:03:04.660 --> 00:03:07.240 align:middle line:84%
I'm a scientist, I'm
a degreed geologist,

00:03:07.240 --> 00:03:11.830 align:middle line:84%
and I follow the scientific
journals and the investigations

00:03:11.830 --> 00:03:14.770 align:middle line:84%
that are done by degreed
scientists who are

00:03:14.770 --> 00:03:16.815 align:middle line:90%
asking these very questions.

00:03:16.815 --> 00:03:18.190 align:middle line:84%
And what I've come
to understand,

00:03:18.190 --> 00:03:20.023 align:middle line:84%
in many cases very
different from what we'll

00:03:20.023 --> 00:03:23.050 align:middle line:84%
see on that YouTube video
or some of the e-mails

00:03:23.050 --> 00:03:28.250 align:middle line:84%
that are floating around,
climate change is a fact.

00:03:28.250 --> 00:03:31.330 align:middle line:84%
As a geologist, I
can tell you that.

00:03:31.330 --> 00:03:35.530 align:middle line:84%
It is not happening
for the reasons that

00:03:35.530 --> 00:03:37.570 align:middle line:84%
were being given
publicly, and we talked

00:03:37.570 --> 00:03:40.150 align:middle line:90%
about this in Missing Links.

00:03:40.150 --> 00:03:42.820 align:middle line:84%
There are some
schools of thought

00:03:42.820 --> 00:03:46.870 align:middle line:84%
that are now suggesting that we
can somehow change the climate

00:03:46.870 --> 00:03:49.960 align:middle line:84%
change, reverse the climate
change, through geoengineering.

00:03:49.960 --> 00:03:54.730 align:middle line:84%
Through spraying particulates
in the upper atmosphere.

00:03:54.730 --> 00:03:57.160 align:middle line:84%
And there is evidence
to support that.

00:03:57.160 --> 00:03:58.810 align:middle line:90%
The experiments have been done.

00:03:58.810 --> 00:04:02.090 align:middle line:84%
This has actually been done
in the past, where aerosols,

00:04:02.090 --> 00:04:06.390 align:middle line:84%
is what they're called,
in the high elevations

00:04:06.390 --> 00:04:09.970 align:middle line:84%
or high altitudes,
aluminum products.

00:04:09.970 --> 00:04:13.270 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes there are some
other chemical products,

00:04:13.270 --> 00:04:14.950 align:middle line:90%
but primarily aluminum.

00:04:14.950 --> 00:04:19.370 align:middle line:84%
The idea is to reflect as
much sunlight as possible

00:04:19.370 --> 00:04:21.730 align:middle line:90%
back away from the Earth.

00:04:21.730 --> 00:04:23.290 align:middle line:84%
Has that been done
experimentally?

00:04:23.290 --> 00:04:25.570 align:middle line:84%
The evidence
suggests that it has.

00:04:25.570 --> 00:04:28.900 align:middle line:84%
When we look up into the
sky from our front yard

00:04:28.900 --> 00:04:33.790 align:middle line:84%
every morning and we see a white
streak across our front yard,

00:04:33.790 --> 00:04:37.270 align:middle line:84%
does that mean that we're in
the middle of the chemtrail?

00:04:37.270 --> 00:04:38.810 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely not.

00:04:38.810 --> 00:04:43.360 align:middle line:84%
There are a number
of conditions where

00:04:43.360 --> 00:04:47.290 align:middle line:84%
conventional aircraft,
commercial aircraft,

00:04:47.290 --> 00:04:49.240 align:middle line:84%
different meteorological
conditions, they will

00:04:49.240 --> 00:04:50.050 align:middle line:90%
leave those trails.

00:04:50.050 --> 00:04:51.534 align:middle line:90%
And those trails will linger.

00:04:51.534 --> 00:04:53.950 align:middle line:84%
But we're being told that they
don't, but they will linger

00:04:53.950 --> 00:04:55.370 align:middle line:90%
and they will spread.

00:04:55.370 --> 00:04:58.300 align:middle line:84%
We've got evidence from this
early in the 20th century,

00:04:58.300 --> 00:05:00.179 align:middle line:84%
before any of this
was even happening.

00:05:00.179 --> 00:05:01.720 align:middle line:84%
Certain meteorologic
conditions, when

00:05:01.720 --> 00:05:03.681 align:middle line:84%
the humidity is a
certain kind of humidity

00:05:03.681 --> 00:05:05.680 align:middle line:84%
and the planes are flying
at a certain altitude,

00:05:05.680 --> 00:05:07.221 align:middle line:84%
they're using certain
kinds of fuels.

00:05:07.221 --> 00:05:08.510 align:middle line:90%
There are a lot of variables.

00:05:08.510 --> 00:05:14.440 align:middle line:84%
So what I would like to say
to our viewers is every vapor

00:05:14.440 --> 00:05:19.270 align:middle line:84%
trail that you see in the
sky, I don't see any evidence

00:05:19.270 --> 00:05:23.720 align:middle line:84%
to suggest that that is a
chemtrail that is poisoning us.

00:05:23.720 --> 00:05:24.970 align:middle line:90%
Have we done this in the past?

00:05:24.970 --> 00:05:25.970 align:middle line:90%
As I mentioned, we have.

00:05:25.970 --> 00:05:29.130 align:middle line:84%
And this comes up in some of the
other parts of Missing Links.

00:05:29.130 --> 00:05:31.540 align:middle line:84%
As a scientist,
I've been involved

00:05:31.540 --> 00:05:35.980 align:middle line:84%
in the industry, various
industries, the earth sciences

00:05:35.980 --> 00:05:39.640 align:middle line:84%
industry, the defense industry
during the Cold War years,

00:05:39.640 --> 00:05:42.311 align:middle line:84%
where amazing technologies
are developed.

00:05:42.311 --> 00:05:44.560 align:middle line:84%
And there's a question,
Tiffany, that always comes up.

00:05:44.560 --> 00:05:46.560 align:middle line:84%
And that's it's a tough
question that scientists

00:05:46.560 --> 00:05:48.770 align:middle line:90%
grapple with all the time.

00:05:48.770 --> 00:05:50.530 align:middle line:90%
And the question is simply this.

00:05:50.530 --> 00:05:54.590 align:middle line:84%
Because we can do something,
does that mean that we should?

00:05:54.590 --> 00:05:55.390 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:05:55.390 --> 00:05:58.890 align:middle line:84%
>> Because we can genetically
modify an embryo before

00:05:58.890 --> 00:06:01.390 align:middle line:84%
it's born to make it perfect,
does that mean that we should?

00:06:01.390 --> 00:06:04.459 align:middle line:84%
Because we can manipulate
time and space,

00:06:04.459 --> 00:06:05.500 align:middle line:90%
does that mean we should?

00:06:05.500 --> 00:06:08.650 align:middle line:84%
Because we can
geoengineer our planet,

00:06:08.650 --> 00:06:10.520 align:middle line:90%
does that mean that we should?

00:06:10.520 --> 00:06:12.520 align:middle line:84%
And there are two schools
of thought with regard

00:06:12.520 --> 00:06:13.320 align:middle line:90%
to the answers.

00:06:13.320 --> 00:06:16.270 align:middle line:84%
I've been with scientists
that say to me, Gregg,

00:06:16.270 --> 00:06:19.690 align:middle line:84%
because we can, that gives
us the right to do it.

00:06:19.690 --> 00:06:21.597 align:middle line:84%
If we were never
meant to do this,

00:06:21.597 --> 00:06:22.930 align:middle line:90%
we never would have learned how.

00:06:22.930 --> 00:06:24.680 align:middle line:90%
That's one school of thought.

00:06:24.680 --> 00:06:27.850 align:middle line:84%
Another school of thought
says that while we

00:06:27.850 --> 00:06:32.290 align:middle line:84%
have the knowledge to unlock
the keys to creation and life

00:06:32.290 --> 00:06:34.540 align:middle line:84%
in the universe,
it's up to us, we

00:06:34.540 --> 00:06:36.940 align:middle line:84%
have to find our
own moral compass.

00:06:36.940 --> 00:06:39.670 align:middle line:84%
Where do we draw the
line, and how do we apply

00:06:39.670 --> 00:06:41.380 align:middle line:90%
what we now know to be true?

00:06:41.380 --> 00:06:44.830 align:middle line:84%
And this is why I think this
is a really important question.

00:06:44.830 --> 00:06:48.440 align:middle line:84%
Because I think everyone
knows our world is changing.

00:06:48.440 --> 00:06:51.650 align:middle line:84%
We are at what I call
the sweet spot right now,

00:06:51.650 --> 00:06:55.230 align:middle line:84%
where we have the technology
to do whatever we want.

00:06:55.230 --> 00:06:59.150 align:middle line:84%
And now, we must
bring the wisdom

00:06:59.150 --> 00:07:02.900 align:middle line:84%
that we have created
among ourselves.

00:07:02.900 --> 00:07:05.120 align:middle line:84%
Who are we, what is
the value of life, what

00:07:05.120 --> 00:07:06.380 align:middle line:90%
is the value of human life?

00:07:06.380 --> 00:07:08.990 align:middle line:84%
How much do we cherish
the life on the planet?

00:07:08.990 --> 00:07:11.930 align:middle line:84%
Where do we draw the line
between what we manipulate what

00:07:11.930 --> 00:07:12.830 align:middle line:90%
we don't?

00:07:12.830 --> 00:07:16.760 align:middle line:84%
We're at that point right now
where we must determine that.

00:07:16.760 --> 00:07:21.040 align:middle line:84%
Because the technology
is pushing us to be used.

00:07:21.040 --> 00:07:26.150 align:middle line:84%
So there are proposals,
very real proposals,

00:07:26.150 --> 00:07:29.330 align:middle line:84%
from scientific
agencies that say

00:07:29.330 --> 00:07:32.950 align:middle line:84%
we now have the ability to
geoengineer this planet,

00:07:32.950 --> 00:07:35.870 align:middle line:90%
to cool off the planet.

00:07:35.870 --> 00:07:38.472 align:middle line:84%
And I'd like to talk
at some point about why

00:07:38.472 --> 00:07:40.180 align:middle line:84%
I think it would be
a mistake to do that,

00:07:40.180 --> 00:07:42.055 align:middle line:84%
and that may be another
question you're going

00:07:42.055 --> 00:07:43.620 align:middle line:90%
to ask about climate change.

00:07:43.620 --> 00:07:45.078 align:middle line:84%
Because the climate
change is going

00:07:45.078 --> 00:07:47.900 align:middle line:84%
to cool the planet for
us, and I'll say that now.

00:07:47.900 --> 00:07:49.644 align:middle line:84%
So to wrap up,
and I know this is

00:07:49.644 --> 00:07:51.060 align:middle line:84%
a long answer to
a short question,

00:07:51.060 --> 00:07:53.690 align:middle line:84%
but we're tying some
concepts together here.

00:07:53.690 --> 00:07:59.060 align:middle line:84%
There has been some regulation
regarding the geoengineering.

00:07:59.060 --> 00:08:01.860 align:middle line:84%
And while pilot
programs have happened,

00:08:01.860 --> 00:08:04.700 align:middle line:84%
I don't see it happening
on a large scale right now,

00:08:04.700 --> 00:08:05.520 align:middle line:90%
me personally.

00:08:05.520 --> 00:08:06.320 align:middle line:90%
>> Thank you.

00:08:06.320 --> 00:08:09.980 align:middle line:10%
So I think you might have
touched on this a little bit,

00:08:09.980 --> 00:08:11.660 align:middle line:10%
this question from Maureen.

00:08:11.660 --> 00:08:13.190 align:middle line:84%
She wants to know
what is the best

00:08:13.190 --> 00:08:17.030 align:middle line:84%
way to enlighten the "people
in power" about global warming

00:08:17.030 --> 00:08:19.020 align:middle line:90%
as a naturally-occurring event.

00:08:19.020 --> 00:08:20.750 align:middle line:84%
But it sounds like
if we just keep

00:08:20.750 --> 00:08:23.525 align:middle line:84%
having these conversations,
how do we get them, too?

00:08:23.525 --> 00:08:26.570 align:middle line:84%
>> The question, how
do we enlighten people?

00:08:26.570 --> 00:08:29.254 align:middle line:10%
My experience is it's impossible
to enlighten someone that

00:08:29.254 --> 00:08:30.545 align:middle line:10%
doesn't want to be enlightened.

00:08:30.545 --> 00:08:31.345 align:middle line:90%
>> True

00:08:31.345 --> 00:08:35.270 align:middle line:84%
>> So what we're talking
about is scientific fact.

00:08:35.270 --> 00:08:37.909 align:middle line:84%
Peer-reviewed science, I'm going
to make a quick distinction

00:08:37.909 --> 00:08:38.709 align:middle line:90%
here.

00:08:38.709 --> 00:08:41.720 align:middle line:84%
There's a big distinction
between a scientist writing

00:08:41.720 --> 00:08:45.350 align:middle line:84%
his opinion on a piece of paper
and posting it on the Internet,

00:08:45.350 --> 00:08:47.540 align:middle line:84%
and the scientist creating
a paper circulating

00:08:47.540 --> 00:08:50.930 align:middle line:84%
among university
and peers, looking

00:08:50.930 --> 00:08:53.480 align:middle line:84%
for places where the
theory doesn't hold up,

00:08:53.480 --> 00:08:54.942 align:middle line:90%
and then publishing that.

00:08:54.942 --> 00:08:56.650 align:middle line:84%
And what I'm sharing
here as a scientist,

00:08:56.650 --> 00:08:58.370 align:middle line:84%
I'm a degreed geologist,
I'm sharing this

00:08:58.370 --> 00:09:03.360 align:middle line:84%
from a perspective of a
peer-reviewed science,

00:09:03.360 --> 00:09:04.880 align:middle line:84%
there are many
people that simply

00:09:04.880 --> 00:09:07.130 align:middle line:90%
don't want to be enlightened.

00:09:07.130 --> 00:09:10.070 align:middle line:84%
Those that want to
know already know.

00:09:10.070 --> 00:09:10.940 align:middle line:90%
This is no secret.

00:09:10.940 --> 00:09:13.089 align:middle line:84%
The things that we've
shared are no secret.

00:09:13.089 --> 00:09:14.630 align:middle line:84%
They're in the
peer-reviewed science.

00:09:14.630 --> 00:09:16.610 align:middle line:84%
They're not in the
popular media, however.

00:09:16.610 --> 00:09:18.440 align:middle line:84%
And this is what I
was saying earlier.

00:09:18.440 --> 00:09:21.950 align:middle line:84%
There's a story, there's a
scientific story about us,

00:09:21.950 --> 00:09:25.100 align:middle line:84%
who we are in our
relationship to the earth,

00:09:25.100 --> 00:09:26.540 align:middle line:90%
and there's a battle right now.

00:09:26.540 --> 00:09:28.580 align:middle line:84%
A struggle that is
going on to preserve

00:09:28.580 --> 00:09:30.600 align:middle line:90%
a story that's now obsolete.

00:09:30.600 --> 00:09:33.090 align:middle line:84%
So the first season
of Missing Links,

00:09:33.090 --> 00:09:35.750 align:middle line:84%
and again, this isn't about
making anything right or wrong,

00:09:35.750 --> 00:09:36.550 align:middle line:90%
or good or bad.

00:09:36.550 --> 00:09:40.580 align:middle line:84%
My sole purpose in sharing
this is what I just mentioned.

00:09:40.580 --> 00:09:45.110 align:middle line:84%
We are at this precious moment
in the history of our planet

00:09:45.110 --> 00:09:48.110 align:middle line:84%
when the choices that we make
now, because of the technology

00:09:48.110 --> 00:09:50.630 align:middle line:84%
we've developed,
we have the ability

00:09:50.630 --> 00:09:57.280 align:middle line:84%
to forever change the balance
of energy and life and climate

00:09:57.280 --> 00:09:58.080 align:middle line:90%
forever.

00:09:58.080 --> 00:09:59.090 align:middle line:90%
We can do that.

00:09:59.090 --> 00:10:02.400 align:middle line:90%
So we must make choices.

00:10:02.400 --> 00:10:05.150 align:middle line:84%
What do we value, where
do we put our priorities?

00:10:05.150 --> 00:10:06.470 align:middle line:90%
And make those choices now.

00:10:06.470 --> 00:10:08.720 align:middle line:84%
And that's the purpose,
that's the reason, that we

00:10:08.720 --> 00:10:09.920 align:middle line:90%
created this Missing Links.

00:10:09.920 --> 00:10:12.830 align:middle line:84%
To share the new
discoveries that

00:10:12.830 --> 00:10:17.690 align:middle line:84%
are circulating in these
very technical journals

00:10:17.690 --> 00:10:19.450 align:middle line:90%
among small groups of people.

00:10:19.450 --> 00:10:22.880 align:middle line:84%
But the average person
watching CNN or BBC World,

00:10:22.880 --> 00:10:24.507 align:middle line:84%
they're not going
to see these things.

00:10:24.507 --> 00:10:26.090 align:middle line:84%
But it based on
peer-reviewed science.

00:10:26.090 --> 00:10:29.730 align:middle line:84%
So the people in
power, many of them,

00:10:29.730 --> 00:10:34.537 align:middle line:84%
there are many agendas that
help people to move into power.

00:10:34.537 --> 00:10:36.620 align:middle line:84%
And I'm not saying the
right, wrong, good, or bad.

00:10:36.620 --> 00:10:38.930 align:middle line:84%
And I'm not trying to make
anyone right, wrong, good,

00:10:38.930 --> 00:10:39.730 align:middle line:90%
or bad.

00:10:39.730 --> 00:10:41.460 align:middle line:90%
My question is this.

00:10:41.460 --> 00:10:46.890 align:middle line:84%
How can we become resilient
to a time of extremes

00:10:46.890 --> 00:10:48.930 align:middle line:84%
when our planet is
changing, unless we

00:10:48.930 --> 00:10:51.480 align:middle line:84%
are honest with ourselves
about that change?

00:10:51.480 --> 00:10:53.400 align:middle line:90%
Honest, truthful, and factual.

00:10:53.400 --> 00:10:55.350 align:middle line:84%
And so that's all I'm
inviting people to do

00:10:55.350 --> 00:10:59.130 align:middle line:84%
is, let's embrace the deepest
truths of our existence.

00:10:59.130 --> 00:11:01.890 align:middle line:84%
What Mother Earth is showing
us through her records,

00:11:01.890 --> 00:11:03.570 align:middle line:84%
the science, and
let's apply this

00:11:03.570 --> 00:11:05.550 align:middle line:90%
in a healthy way in our lives.

00:11:05.550 --> 00:11:06.410 align:middle line:90%
>> I like that.

00:11:06.410 --> 00:11:08.159 align:middle line:84%
I like what you said
about making choices,

00:11:08.159 --> 00:11:10.810 align:middle line:84%
and that leads us into
Justin B's question.

00:11:10.810 --> 00:11:13.920 align:middle line:84%
He says, "If climate change
is a natural occurrence,

00:11:13.920 --> 00:11:16.680 align:middle line:84%
does our human footprint on this
planet still have an effect?"

00:11:16.680 --> 00:11:19.080 align:middle line:84%
Maybe you can talk about some
of the choices we can make.

00:11:19.080 --> 00:11:20.340 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, climate change.

00:11:20.340 --> 00:11:22.890 align:middle line:84%
It's a huge topic, and we
could do this whole program

00:11:22.890 --> 00:11:23.700 align:middle line:90%
on climate change.

00:11:23.700 --> 00:11:27.780 align:middle line:84%
We devoted, I believe,
one episode, and probably

00:11:27.780 --> 00:11:30.090 align:middle line:84%
a little bit of another
episode of Missing Links.

00:11:30.090 --> 00:11:33.620 align:middle line:84%
We could have done the whole
series on climate change.

00:11:33.620 --> 00:11:35.220 align:middle line:84%
So let me just
encapsulate quickly.

00:11:35.220 --> 00:11:37.770 align:middle line:84%
As a geologist and
earth scientist,

00:11:37.770 --> 00:11:40.050 align:middle line:84%
what the data strongly
suggests and what

00:11:40.050 --> 00:11:44.890 align:middle line:84%
many scientists are embracing is
that climate change is a fact.

00:11:44.890 --> 00:11:46.400 align:middle line:90%
I think we all know that.

00:11:46.400 --> 00:11:49.680 align:middle line:84%
It is being driven by
Earth's location in space,

00:11:49.680 --> 00:11:51.920 align:middle line:90%
Earth's locations to the sun.

00:11:51.920 --> 00:11:54.280 align:middle line:84%
Three parameters, the tilt,
the angle, and the wobble.

00:11:54.280 --> 00:11:56.430 align:middle line:84%
The precession of
the equinoxes, what's

00:11:56.430 --> 00:12:00.030 align:middle line:84%
called the orbit of the
Earth around the Sun,

00:12:00.030 --> 00:12:02.880 align:middle line:84%
sometimes it's further,
sometimes it's closer.

00:12:02.880 --> 00:12:06.330 align:middle line:84%
And it's the tilt
angle and the obliquity

00:12:06.330 --> 00:12:08.370 align:middle line:90%
is what we're talking about.

00:12:08.370 --> 00:12:09.620 align:middle line:90%
Scientists know this.

00:12:09.620 --> 00:12:11.070 align:middle line:90%
This isn't a secret.

00:12:11.070 --> 00:12:12.570 align:middle line:84%
If we were not on
this planet, Earth

00:12:12.570 --> 00:12:14.770 align:middle line:84%
would still be going
through climate change.

00:12:14.770 --> 00:12:15.885 align:middle line:90%
But here's the key.

00:12:15.885 --> 00:12:17.510 align:middle line:84%
If you look at the
records of the past,

00:12:17.510 --> 00:12:20.430 align:middle line:84%
and I prefer Mother Earth's
own records from the ice cores,

00:12:20.430 --> 00:12:23.430 align:middle line:84%
rather than the interpretation
from a corporation

00:12:23.430 --> 00:12:27.210 align:middle line:84%
or from a scientist who's
beholden to someone who

00:12:27.210 --> 00:12:31.050 align:middle line:84%
is funding their research, what
Mother Earth's records show

00:12:31.050 --> 00:12:34.320 align:middle line:84%
us is that we are, in fact,
undergoing climate change.

00:12:34.320 --> 00:12:37.500 align:middle line:84%
And the climate
has warmed briefly.

00:12:37.500 --> 00:12:40.980 align:middle line:84%
And not that much, compared
to other times in the past.

00:12:40.980 --> 00:12:43.560 align:middle line:84%
It's about a third
as warm now is

00:12:43.560 --> 00:12:46.770 align:middle line:84%
what it was during a time called
the medieval warming period,

00:12:46.770 --> 00:12:51.660 align:middle line:84%
around 800, right around
in that period of time.

00:12:51.660 --> 00:12:54.630 align:middle line:84%
But what's important is,
after the warming happens,

00:12:54.630 --> 00:12:56.910 align:middle line:84%
the warming is
intense, it's brief.

00:12:56.910 --> 00:12:59.830 align:middle line:84%
And it's what comes next
that can be the problem.

00:12:59.830 --> 00:13:01.140 align:middle line:90%
And that is the cooling.

00:13:01.140 --> 00:13:04.355 align:middle line:84%
There's an abrupt cooling
that always comes afterwards

00:13:04.355 --> 00:13:07.140 align:middle line:84%
So, Tiffany, here's where
it gets really interesting.

00:13:07.140 --> 00:13:12.030 align:middle line:84%
What the Earth's climate records
show is the carbon dioxide

00:13:12.030 --> 00:13:14.730 align:middle line:84%
levels, when they
increase, that's

00:13:14.730 --> 00:13:15.810 align:middle line:90%
when the cooling happens.

00:13:15.810 --> 00:13:19.710 align:middle line:84%
The higher the CO2 levels, the
cooler the temperatures get.

00:13:19.710 --> 00:13:22.860 align:middle line:84%
Not the warming that
we see right now.

00:13:22.860 --> 00:13:25.200 align:middle line:84%
So Earth has had cooling
cycles in the past

00:13:25.200 --> 00:13:29.490 align:middle line:84%
based on the CO2 that was
available from natural sources.

00:13:29.490 --> 00:13:33.030 align:middle line:84%
We have now kicked
more carbon dioxide

00:13:33.030 --> 00:13:35.640 align:middle line:84%
into the atmosphere of our
planet in the last century

00:13:35.640 --> 00:13:37.860 align:middle line:90%
than we've ever had in the past.

00:13:37.860 --> 00:13:40.340 align:middle line:84%
If the little bit
of CO2 from the past

00:13:40.340 --> 00:13:43.350 align:middle line:84%
caused the cooling that
we're seeing in the ice cores

00:13:43.350 --> 00:13:47.010 align:middle line:84%
from Antarctica, that we
showed in Missing Links,

00:13:47.010 --> 00:13:49.710 align:middle line:84%
there's a lot of CO2
that we now have.

00:13:49.710 --> 00:13:50.670 align:middle line:90%
What does that mean?

00:13:50.670 --> 00:13:52.740 align:middle line:84%
And the implications are
that the cooling, I'm

00:13:52.740 --> 00:13:55.530 align:middle line:84%
not saying an ice age, but
we may see a little bit more

00:13:55.530 --> 00:13:58.260 align:middle line:84%
cooling that we have,
which is only a problem

00:13:58.260 --> 00:13:59.760 align:middle line:90%
if we're not prepared for it.

00:13:59.760 --> 00:14:02.340 align:middle line:84%
So if we can be
honest with ourselves

00:14:02.340 --> 00:14:06.109 align:middle line:84%
and embrace what these
changes really mean,

00:14:06.109 --> 00:14:07.650 align:middle line:84%
I think they're not
a problem at all.

00:14:07.650 --> 00:14:11.340 align:middle line:84%
Because we are simply
going through a cycle.

00:14:11.340 --> 00:14:13.710 align:middle line:84%
But the thinking in
the past has always

00:14:13.710 --> 00:14:15.770 align:middle line:90%
been that climate is static.

00:14:15.770 --> 00:14:18.660 align:middle line:84%
And when something
begins to change,

00:14:18.660 --> 00:14:20.580 align:middle line:84%
we either think
something's wrong,

00:14:20.580 --> 00:14:22.560 align:middle line:84%
or we work to try to
force the climate back

00:14:22.560 --> 00:14:24.300 align:middle line:90%
to where it used to be.

00:14:24.300 --> 00:14:25.860 align:middle line:84%
This ties into the
previous question.

00:14:25.860 --> 00:14:29.550 align:middle line:84%
This is why from my opinion,
my personal opinion,

00:14:29.550 --> 00:14:33.180 align:middle line:84%
is that it's a mistake
to try to geoengineer

00:14:33.180 --> 00:14:35.520 align:middle line:84%
to put that stuff
in the atmosphere

00:14:35.520 --> 00:14:37.080 align:middle line:90%
and make the earth cooler.

00:14:37.080 --> 00:14:39.780 align:middle line:84%
Because Earth, Mother
Nature, Mother Earth

00:14:39.780 --> 00:14:42.270 align:middle line:84%
is working on her
rhythm in a cycle that's

00:14:42.270 --> 00:14:45.180 align:middle line:90%
more than 20 years or 30 years.

00:14:45.180 --> 00:14:49.380 align:middle line:84%
And the intricacies,
the interrelated nature

00:14:49.380 --> 00:14:52.290 align:middle line:84%
of these parameters, we're
just beginning to understand.

00:14:52.290 --> 00:14:54.450 align:middle line:84%
So to try to change
them before we fully

00:14:54.450 --> 00:14:58.260 align:middle line:84%
understand them, in my
opinion, is irresponsible.

00:14:58.260 --> 00:15:00.030 align:middle line:90%
So are they happening?

00:15:00.030 --> 00:15:02.390 align:middle line:84%
Yes, and this is where I think
we are in this right now.

00:15:02.390 --> 00:15:04.140 align:middle line:84%
Does that make sense
if I say it that way?

00:15:04.140 --> 00:15:04.430 align:middle line:90%
Did I cover all--

00:15:04.430 --> 00:15:04.870 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes, absolutely.

00:15:04.870 --> 00:15:06.600 align:middle line:84%
I was wondering,
when you said that we

00:15:06.600 --> 00:15:09.939 align:middle line:84%
do have the means to change the
climate back to how it was when

00:15:09.939 --> 00:15:11.480 align:middle line:84%
you said "initially,"
I was wondering

00:15:11.480 --> 00:15:12.929 align:middle line:90%
if that was beneficial or not.

00:15:12.929 --> 00:15:14.220 align:middle line:90%
And I'm glad you answered that.

00:15:14.220 --> 00:15:15.330 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, I don't think so.

00:15:15.330 --> 00:15:18.330 align:middle line:84%
And what's interesting is, when
you look at the years records,

00:15:18.330 --> 00:15:21.090 align:middle line:84%
the climate change that
we're undergoing now

00:15:21.090 --> 00:15:24.400 align:middle line:84%
is so minuscule compared to
what it's been in the past.

00:15:24.400 --> 00:15:25.470 align:middle line:90%
Are we warming?

00:15:25.470 --> 00:15:25.740 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:15:25.740 --> 00:15:28.050 align:middle line:84%
We're not nearly as warm
as we've been in the past.

00:15:28.050 --> 00:15:31.530 align:middle line:84%
And the warming that
we've seen, even--

00:15:31.530 --> 00:15:35.910 align:middle line:84%
scientists, they tend to look
at things in a shorter scale.

00:15:35.910 --> 00:15:39.360 align:middle line:84%
We're comparing
temperatures today

00:15:39.360 --> 00:15:42.210 align:middle line:84%
to where they were
20, 25, 30 years ago.

00:15:42.210 --> 00:15:44.670 align:middle line:84%
Mother Nature doesn't
work on those scales.

00:15:44.670 --> 00:15:47.460 align:middle line:84%
She's working on
centuries and millennia.

00:15:47.460 --> 00:15:51.270 align:middle line:84%
So if you look at a
snapshot, you say, my God.

00:15:51.270 --> 00:15:52.916 align:middle line:90%
Something's wrong.

00:15:52.916 --> 00:15:55.540 align:middle line:84%
When you look at the big picture
and you gain that perspective,

00:15:55.540 --> 00:15:57.070 align:middle line:90%
you say, my God.

00:15:57.070 --> 00:16:00.675 align:middle line:84%
We're right in the rhythm with
where we've been in the past.

00:16:00.675 --> 00:16:01.550 align:middle line:90%
I'll put it this way.

00:16:01.550 --> 00:16:03.310 align:middle line:84%
If we were not having
some warming now,

00:16:03.310 --> 00:16:04.930 align:middle line:90%
I would be concerned.

00:16:04.930 --> 00:16:07.350 align:middle line:84%
Because I would say
what's different now

00:16:07.350 --> 00:16:09.430 align:middle line:84%
from when we reached
this point in the past?

00:16:09.430 --> 00:16:11.050 align:middle line:90%
Why isn't Earth?

00:16:11.050 --> 00:16:13.720 align:middle line:84%
These are cycles within
cycles, 100,000-year cycles,

00:16:13.720 --> 00:16:18.290 align:middle line:84%
41,000-year cycles,
25,000-, 5,000-year cycles.

00:16:18.290 --> 00:16:22.690 align:middle line:84%
So if we have done
nothing, I think

00:16:22.690 --> 00:16:25.816 align:middle line:84%
we would see the reversal
of this climate change.

00:16:25.816 --> 00:16:27.190 align:middle line:84%
I got to be really
clear on this.

00:16:27.190 --> 00:16:29.200 align:middle line:90%
We definitely need to go green.

00:16:29.200 --> 00:16:31.720 align:middle line:84%
We definitely need to
stop burning fossil fuels.

00:16:31.720 --> 00:16:35.050 align:middle line:84%
We have the technology to
give us the ability to-- we've

00:16:35.050 --> 00:16:38.350 align:middle line:84%
had that technology for 60 years
to stop burning fossil fuels.

00:16:38.350 --> 00:16:43.300 align:middle line:84%
We need to stop kicking these
pollutants into the air.

00:16:43.300 --> 00:16:45.924 align:middle line:84%
Norwegian scientists have
taken this a step further,

00:16:45.924 --> 00:16:47.590 align:middle line:84%
and we're all looking
at climate change.

00:16:47.590 --> 00:16:50.710 align:middle line:84%
And what they're telling us,
they've got a beautiful pie

00:16:50.710 --> 00:16:55.210 align:middle line:84%
chart, is there are eight
fundamental parameters that

00:16:55.210 --> 00:16:58.030 align:middle line:84%
must be in place
to preserve what

00:16:58.030 --> 00:17:02.620 align:middle line:84%
is called the safe zone for
life to inhabit planet Earth.

00:17:02.620 --> 00:17:05.950 align:middle line:84%
Climate change is only one
of those eight parameters.

00:17:05.950 --> 00:17:10.690 align:middle line:84%
And each parameter, we get
to see how far we have,

00:17:10.690 --> 00:17:12.190 align:middle line:84%
or if we have, come
to the boundary,

00:17:12.190 --> 00:17:13.780 align:middle line:90%
if we have crossed the boundary.

00:17:13.780 --> 00:17:16.510 align:middle line:84%
Climate change, we're just
really close to the boundary.

00:17:16.510 --> 00:17:19.569 align:middle line:84%
It's as bad as people
are making it sound.

00:17:19.569 --> 00:17:22.000 align:middle line:84%
Other parameters,
we are over 2/3.

00:17:22.000 --> 00:17:24.069 align:middle line:84%
We've crossed that
boundary and we keep going.

00:17:24.069 --> 00:17:27.670 align:middle line:10%
One of those is the
acidification of the oceans,

00:17:27.670 --> 00:17:30.640 align:middle line:10%
making the oceans acid.

00:17:30.640 --> 00:17:32.800 align:middle line:10%
One of those is the
loss of biodiversity.

00:17:32.800 --> 00:17:35.230 align:middle line:10%
We're losing species
on this planet

00:17:35.230 --> 00:17:37.330 align:middle line:10%
faster than we've ever seen.

00:17:37.330 --> 00:17:40.300 align:middle line:84%
We've been through five mass
extinctions in the past.

00:17:40.300 --> 00:17:42.070 align:middle line:84%
Biologists are
telling us right now

00:17:42.070 --> 00:17:45.120 align:middle line:84%
we are in the midst of
the sixth mass extinction.

00:17:45.120 --> 00:17:48.530 align:middle line:84%
And the question is, will
humans be a part of that?

00:17:48.530 --> 00:17:49.670 align:middle line:90%
I am an optimist.

00:17:49.670 --> 00:17:52.780 align:middle line:84%
I think we're going to learn
about this delicate, precious

00:17:52.780 --> 00:17:57.286 align:middle line:84%
balance, and learn to cherish
and preserve what we have.

00:17:57.286 --> 00:18:00.640 align:middle line:84%
But, Tiffany, this is the way
we seem to learn as humans.

00:18:00.640 --> 00:18:04.240 align:middle line:84%
By experiencing what
we don't want first,

00:18:04.240 --> 00:18:06.280 align:middle line:84%
and then saying
we don't want it,

00:18:06.280 --> 00:18:10.000 align:middle line:84%
rather than saying this is
the way we choose to live

00:18:10.000 --> 00:18:12.215 align:middle line:84%
and putting everything in
place to move that way.

00:18:12.215 --> 00:18:13.090 align:middle line:90%
Does that make sense?

00:18:13.090 --> 00:18:13.890 align:middle line:90%
>> It does.

00:18:13.890 --> 00:18:15.830 align:middle line:84%
>> It's a really
interesting way to learn.

00:18:15.830 --> 00:18:20.230 align:middle line:84%
So we have now learned that we
do love and cherish our planet.

00:18:20.230 --> 00:18:24.220 align:middle line:84%
And it's like a ship on
the ocean making a turn

00:18:24.220 --> 00:18:25.060 align:middle line:90%
to go back to port.

00:18:25.060 --> 00:18:26.920 align:middle line:90%
They don't turn on a dime.

00:18:26.920 --> 00:18:29.110 align:middle line:84%
Make a long, slow
turn, we need to turn

00:18:29.110 --> 00:18:30.790 align:middle line:90%
this ship a little faster.

00:18:30.790 --> 00:18:36.280 align:middle line:84%
Because we are destroying those
other eight parameters so very

00:18:36.280 --> 00:18:37.510 align:middle line:90%
quickly.

00:18:37.510 --> 00:18:41.720 align:middle line:84%
And I talk about this in the
book Resilience from the Heart,

00:18:41.720 --> 00:18:42.520 align:middle line:90%
we talk about this.

00:18:42.520 --> 00:18:44.590 align:middle line:84%
The book Deep Truth, I
talk about this as well.

00:18:44.590 --> 00:18:46.089 align:middle line:84%
Because climate
change is important,

00:18:46.089 --> 00:18:47.745 align:middle line:90%
and it is one of other factors.

00:18:47.745 --> 00:18:51.040 align:middle line:84%
>> Let's talk a little bit
more about the cooling effects

00:18:51.040 --> 00:18:52.310 align:middle line:90%
on the Earth.

00:18:52.310 --> 00:18:55.810 align:middle line:84%
Nadine wants to know
is global warming

00:18:55.810 --> 00:18:58.369 align:middle line:84%
and cooling followed
by a mass extinction?

00:18:58.369 --> 00:18:59.660 align:middle line:90%
Like is it always followed by--

00:18:59.660 --> 00:19:01.040 align:middle line:90%
>> A good question.

00:19:01.040 --> 00:19:01.840 align:middle line:90%
Not necessarily.

00:19:01.840 --> 00:19:02.650 align:middle line:90%
It doesn't have to.

00:19:02.650 --> 00:19:05.200 align:middle line:84%
And this is why we
share this information.

00:19:05.200 --> 00:19:07.060 align:middle line:84%
By being honest,
truthful, and factual,

00:19:07.060 --> 00:19:10.330 align:middle line:84%
it takes a lot of the fear
out of what's happening.

00:19:10.330 --> 00:19:15.040 align:middle line:84%
Mother Earth and Nature
are based in cycles,

00:19:15.040 --> 00:19:18.460 align:middle line:84%
in rhythms, as our
bodies and our lives are.

00:19:18.460 --> 00:19:20.890 align:middle line:84%
Science is only 300
years old, and has

00:19:20.890 --> 00:19:23.080 align:middle line:84%
been reluctant to
embrace those rhythms

00:19:23.080 --> 00:19:26.450 align:middle line:84%
and cycles in the modern world,
the way many of our ancestors

00:19:26.450 --> 00:19:28.680 align:middle line:84%
and the indigenous
traditions have.

00:19:28.680 --> 00:19:33.090 align:middle line:84%
We're going through a
cycle, a natural rhythm,

00:19:33.090 --> 00:19:34.630 align:middle line:90%
a natural cycle.

00:19:34.630 --> 00:19:36.215 align:middle line:90%
We've been through a warming.

00:19:36.215 --> 00:19:37.840 align:middle line:84%
What the evidence
suggests is the Earth

00:19:37.840 --> 00:19:41.290 align:middle line:84%
has not warmed significantly
for at least the last decade,

00:19:41.290 --> 00:19:42.910 align:middle line:90%
possibly longer.

00:19:42.910 --> 00:19:44.890 align:middle line:84%
Probably moving into
a cooling cycle.

00:19:44.890 --> 00:19:48.160 align:middle line:84%
A lot of that is based on
the action from the Sun.

00:19:48.160 --> 00:19:53.350 align:middle line:84%
As the Sun becomes quiet, as
the magnetic storms on the Sun

00:19:53.350 --> 00:19:56.920 align:middle line:84%
begin to dissipate, which
is what has happened,

00:19:56.920 --> 00:20:00.130 align:middle line:84%
Earth typically becomes
cooler during that time.

00:20:00.130 --> 00:20:02.080 align:middle line:90%
Not an ice age, but cooler.

00:20:02.080 --> 00:20:05.140 align:middle line:84%
And this is important,
because even a little cooling

00:20:05.140 --> 00:20:09.070 align:middle line:84%
in the climate globally
changes the weather locally.

00:20:09.070 --> 00:20:11.290 align:middle line:84%
Changes when it rains,
when the seasons come,

00:20:11.290 --> 00:20:12.340 align:middle line:90%
when the monsoons come.

00:20:12.340 --> 00:20:14.798 align:middle line:10%
That changes when we grow our
food, where we grow our food,

00:20:14.798 --> 00:20:15.900 align:middle line:10%
how we grow our food.

00:20:15.900 --> 00:20:18.030 align:middle line:84%
And that changes how people
work and live together.

00:20:18.030 --> 00:20:20.950 align:middle line:90%
So the influence is huge.

00:20:20.950 --> 00:20:23.900 align:middle line:84%
It's only a problem if
we're not prepared for it.

00:20:23.900 --> 00:20:27.070 align:middle line:84%
And we're not prepared only if
we're not honest with ourselves

00:20:27.070 --> 00:20:28.030 align:middle line:90%
about what's happening.

00:20:28.030 --> 00:20:31.180 align:middle line:84%
Truthful, honest,
factual interpretation

00:20:31.180 --> 00:20:34.120 align:middle line:84%
of what the Earth's history
is showing us, I think,

00:20:34.120 --> 00:20:38.680 align:middle line:84%
is the key to us navigating
through this pivotal moment

00:20:38.680 --> 00:20:40.104 align:middle line:90%
in climate change.

00:20:40.104 --> 00:20:41.960 align:middle line:90%
>> Interesting.

00:20:41.960 --> 00:20:45.530 align:middle line:10%
Let's shift gears a little
bit and talk about-- you

00:20:45.530 --> 00:20:46.784 align:middle line:10%
mentioned the Sun.

00:20:46.784 --> 00:20:49.200 align:middle line:84%
I want to talk about the Earth
and its effects on our DNA.

00:20:49.200 --> 00:20:51.950 align:middle line:84%
So Nicole wants to
know, do you think

00:20:51.950 --> 00:20:56.240 align:middle line:84%
our DNA is changing, and/or the
"junk DNA" that you mentioned,

00:20:56.240 --> 00:20:58.930 align:middle line:84%
is it being activated right now
during this time of extra light

00:20:58.930 --> 00:21:00.615 align:middle line:84%
and energy reaching
our planet today?

00:21:00.615 --> 00:21:01.415 align:middle line:90%
>> Sure.

00:21:01.415 --> 00:21:02.320 align:middle line:90%
That's a good question.

00:21:02.320 --> 00:21:03.410 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to approach
this from a little bit

00:21:03.410 --> 00:21:04.842 align:middle line:90%
different perspective.

00:21:04.842 --> 00:21:06.800 align:middle line:84%
And it's actually not
shifting gears that much,

00:21:06.800 --> 00:21:08.660 align:middle line:84%
because we're part of the
natural system that we're

00:21:08.660 --> 00:21:09.460 align:middle line:90%
talking about.

00:21:09.460 --> 00:21:12.920 align:middle line:84%
So we're still talking
about Earth and cycles.

00:21:12.920 --> 00:21:16.320 align:middle line:84%
There's a new science that's
evolved within the last 15

00:21:16.320 --> 00:21:17.120 align:middle line:90%
years or so.

00:21:17.120 --> 00:21:19.060 align:middle line:90%
It's called epigenetics.

00:21:19.060 --> 00:21:21.140 align:middle line:84%
Epigenetics is the
science that says

00:21:21.140 --> 00:21:25.880 align:middle line:84%
to us that our genetic
makeup is not a fixed code.

00:21:25.880 --> 00:21:30.720 align:middle line:84%
We come into this world as
babies with enough of our code

00:21:30.720 --> 00:21:35.420 align:middle line:84%
enabled to get us started
in life in a healthy way.

00:21:35.420 --> 00:21:38.540 align:middle line:84%
What changes the code,
this is important,

00:21:38.540 --> 00:21:42.410 align:middle line:84%
is our perceptions
of our environment.

00:21:42.410 --> 00:21:44.660 align:middle line:84%
Or there could be physical
things in the environment.

00:21:44.660 --> 00:21:48.110 align:middle line:84%
Chemicals, high tension
power lines, things

00:21:48.110 --> 00:21:50.300 align:middle line:84%
like that, we all know
those have an effect.

00:21:50.300 --> 00:21:56.010 align:middle line:84%
But the biggest effect is
our perception of our world.

00:21:56.010 --> 00:21:59.040 align:middle line:84%
So when people ask me, is
the Sun changing our DNA,

00:21:59.040 --> 00:22:00.950 align:middle line:84%
it's not that the
light of the sun

00:22:00.950 --> 00:22:04.430 align:middle line:84%
is going to kick on some
DNA if we go to the beach.

00:22:04.430 --> 00:22:09.230 align:middle line:84%
But as we just mentioned
in the previous question,

00:22:09.230 --> 00:22:11.810 align:middle line:84%
our relationship to the
Sun, the magnetic fields

00:22:11.810 --> 00:22:15.470 align:middle line:84%
of the Sun the ebb and flow,
the magnetic fields of the Earth

00:22:15.470 --> 00:22:16.997 align:middle line:84%
ebb and flow in
response to that.

00:22:16.997 --> 00:22:18.830 align:middle line:84%
And here's where it
gets really interesting,

00:22:18.830 --> 00:22:21.380 align:middle line:84%
Tiffany, is that we are
magnetic fields as well.

00:22:21.380 --> 00:22:23.960 align:middle line:84%
Our hearts are based
in magnetic fields.

00:22:23.960 --> 00:22:25.782 align:middle line:90%
We are polar beings.

00:22:25.782 --> 00:22:27.740 align:middle line:84%
We have a north and a
south pole in our bodies.

00:22:27.740 --> 00:22:29.880 align:middle line:84%
The science, so this
isn't speculation,

00:22:29.880 --> 00:22:33.140 align:middle line:84%
it's not New Age wishful
thinking, this is science,

00:22:33.140 --> 00:22:39.410 align:middle line:84%
is now showing us that humans
are less aggressive and more

00:22:39.410 --> 00:22:43.220 align:middle line:84%
willing to cooperate with the
magnetic fields of the earth

00:22:43.220 --> 00:22:44.940 align:middle line:90%
are stronger.

00:22:44.940 --> 00:22:47.690 align:middle line:84%
So what that says,
or conversely,

00:22:47.690 --> 00:22:51.650 align:middle line:84%
more aggressive, less
willing to cooperate,

00:22:51.650 --> 00:22:56.600 align:middle line:84%
when war and social
hardship happens is when

00:22:56.600 --> 00:22:58.490 align:middle line:90%
the magnetic fields are weaker.

00:22:58.490 --> 00:23:01.190 align:middle line:84%
So now what we're saying
to answer this question,

00:23:01.190 --> 00:23:04.400 align:middle line:84%
it's not the light of the Sun
directly changing the DNA.

00:23:04.400 --> 00:23:06.920 align:middle line:84%
The magnetic fields of
the Sun go through cycles,

00:23:06.920 --> 00:23:09.840 align:middle line:84%
influencing magnetic fields
of the Earth, the human heart,

00:23:09.840 --> 00:23:11.510 align:middle line:90%
the human psyche.

00:23:11.510 --> 00:23:15.300 align:middle line:84%
As we perceive those changes,
we become less aggressive

00:23:15.300 --> 00:23:16.100 align:middle line:90%
or more aggressive.

00:23:16.100 --> 00:23:18.770 align:middle line:84%
And our feelings are
the epigenetic factors

00:23:18.770 --> 00:23:20.360 align:middle line:90%
that change our own DNA.

00:23:20.360 --> 00:23:21.980 align:middle line:90%
So are we changing our DNA?

00:23:21.980 --> 00:23:23.480 align:middle line:90%
We can do it all the time.

00:23:23.480 --> 00:23:26.690 align:middle line:84%
And there's a
multipart question.

00:23:26.690 --> 00:23:28.670 align:middle line:84%
What's called been
called junk DNA,

00:23:28.670 --> 00:23:31.130 align:middle line:84%
we now know Mother Nature
didn't give us any junk.

00:23:31.130 --> 00:23:32.990 align:middle line:90%
Not in the cells.

00:23:32.990 --> 00:23:33.980 align:middle line:90%
It's not junk DNA.

00:23:33.980 --> 00:23:36.710 align:middle line:84%
It simply is DNA whose
function has only recently

00:23:36.710 --> 00:23:37.820 align:middle line:90%
been recognized.

00:23:37.820 --> 00:23:41.150 align:middle line:84%
What we used to call the junk
DNA is giving instructions

00:23:41.150 --> 00:23:44.346 align:middle line:84%
to the other DNA in
terms of the functions

00:23:44.346 --> 00:23:45.470 align:middle line:90%
they perform in our bodies.

00:23:45.470 --> 00:23:47.240 align:middle line:90%
We need that DNA.

00:23:47.240 --> 00:23:49.869 align:middle line:84%
Scientists, for years, when
they pull the DNA of the cell,

00:23:49.869 --> 00:23:51.410 align:middle line:84%
they've been throwing
this stuff out.

00:23:51.410 --> 00:23:52.500 align:middle line:90%
Oh, we don't need this.

00:23:52.500 --> 00:23:55.490 align:middle line:84%
They're just after what
was in the nucleus.

00:23:55.490 --> 00:23:58.170 align:middle line:84%
But there are other
forms of DNA in the cell.

00:23:58.170 --> 00:23:58.970 align:middle line:90%
It's not junk.

00:23:58.970 --> 00:24:04.280 align:middle line:84%
It's sending instructions
to our cell body.

00:24:04.280 --> 00:24:06.920 align:middle line:84%
So what we can say is
that, as the Sun goes

00:24:06.920 --> 00:24:09.890 align:middle line:84%
through these rhythms that
are triggering climate change,

00:24:09.890 --> 00:24:12.520 align:middle line:84%
it is also triggering, can
trigger, genetic changes

00:24:12.520 --> 00:24:13.320 align:middle line:90%
in our body.

00:24:13.320 --> 00:24:16.190 align:middle line:84%
But the key is, it's
how we perceive,

00:24:16.190 --> 00:24:17.540 align:middle line:90%
how we perceive the changes.

00:24:17.540 --> 00:24:21.820 align:middle line:84%
Or whether we feel that we
are less aggressive or more

00:24:21.820 --> 00:24:22.620 align:middle line:90%
aggressive.

00:24:22.620 --> 00:24:26.000 align:middle line:84%
And I'm emphasizing this
because it goes to the point

00:24:26.000 --> 00:24:29.690 align:middle line:84%
that we are empowered
through our perceptions

00:24:29.690 --> 00:24:33.800 align:middle line:84%
to literally change
our biology, to change

00:24:33.800 --> 00:24:39.560 align:middle line:84%
our physical being to adapt
to the world as it changes.

00:24:39.560 --> 00:24:45.200 align:middle line:84%
We're not victims stuck,
fixed, and at the mercy

00:24:45.200 --> 00:24:46.880 align:middle line:84%
of an environment
changing around us.

00:24:46.880 --> 00:24:50.184 align:middle line:84%
We have the ability
to change and adapt

00:24:50.184 --> 00:24:51.850 align:middle line:84%
so that we can thrive,
not just survive,

00:24:51.850 --> 00:24:53.000 align:middle line:90%
but thrive in that environment.

00:24:53.000 --> 00:24:54.255 align:middle line:84%
It's a long answer
to a short question

00:24:54.255 --> 00:24:55.300 align:middle line:90%
>> That is.

00:24:55.300 --> 00:24:58.280 align:middle line:84%
And it goes into
Sarah's question, too.

00:24:58.280 --> 00:24:59.780 align:middle line:84%
She says, "How can
we best prepare

00:24:59.780 --> 00:25:02.984 align:middle line:84%
for any spontaneous genetic
changes caused by solar flare?"

00:25:02.984 --> 00:25:04.400 align:middle line:84%
I would love to
address that spot.

00:25:04.400 --> 00:25:08.000 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, there's a lot of
information on the Internet

00:25:08.000 --> 00:25:10.970 align:middle line:84%
going around about a big solar
flare that's going to affect

00:25:10.970 --> 00:25:12.860 align:middle line:84%
the Earth in a lot
of different ways.

00:25:12.860 --> 00:25:13.730 align:middle line:90%
Is it possible?

00:25:13.730 --> 00:25:14.530 align:middle line:90%
It is possible.

00:25:14.530 --> 00:25:15.440 align:middle line:90%
Anything is possible.

00:25:15.440 --> 00:25:16.580 align:middle line:90%
Have we had them in the past?

00:25:16.580 --> 00:25:17.380 align:middle line:90%
Yes, we have.

00:25:17.380 --> 00:25:20.960 align:middle line:84%
The 1850s was the
last huge solar flare.

00:25:20.960 --> 00:25:23.360 align:middle line:84%
We didn't have the
technology then that we have.

00:25:23.360 --> 00:25:25.970 align:middle line:84%
We didn't have cell phone
towers and power grids the way

00:25:25.970 --> 00:25:26.850 align:middle line:90%
we have now.

00:25:26.850 --> 00:25:29.030 align:middle line:90%
What we did have, it destroyed.

00:25:29.030 --> 00:25:31.955 align:middle line:84%
The telegraph lines that were
there acted as little antenna.

00:25:31.955 --> 00:25:34.330 align:middle line:84%
When that solar flare happened,
it burned everything out.

00:25:34.330 --> 00:25:35.150 align:middle line:90%
So can it happen?

00:25:35.150 --> 00:25:36.170 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:25:36.170 --> 00:25:40.277 align:middle line:84%
Is there evidence that
we are in for one now?

00:25:40.277 --> 00:25:42.110 align:middle line:84%
Personally, I know of
no scientific evidence

00:25:42.110 --> 00:25:42.910 align:middle line:90%
that suggests that.

00:25:42.910 --> 00:25:45.360 align:middle line:84%
Now, I don't know that
it can even be predicted.

00:25:45.360 --> 00:25:49.650 align:middle line:84%
And especially now, because the
Sun has become so very quiet

00:25:49.650 --> 00:25:51.800 align:middle line:84%
and is influencing
the planet the way

00:25:51.800 --> 00:25:53.825 align:middle line:84%
it is in terms of
climate, the cooling

00:25:53.825 --> 00:25:55.700 align:middle line:84%
suggests that if we're
going to have a flare,

00:25:55.700 --> 00:25:57.780 align:middle line:84%
it's not going to
be any anytime soon.

00:25:57.780 --> 00:25:59.420 align:middle line:84%
So that was one part
of the question.

00:25:59.420 --> 00:26:00.620 align:middle line:90%
Then there was another part.

00:26:00.620 --> 00:26:03.750 align:middle line:84%
>> She just wanted to know how
we can best prepare for it.

00:26:03.750 --> 00:26:07.640 align:middle line:84%
>> The best way, and I've talked
about this in Missing Links

00:26:07.640 --> 00:26:13.280 align:middle line:84%
toward the end of the
program, new discoveries made

00:26:13.280 --> 00:26:17.690 align:middle line:84%
in the early 1990s now tell us
that our heart and our brain,

00:26:17.690 --> 00:26:20.360 align:middle line:84%
two separate organs, are
connected through a neural

00:26:20.360 --> 00:26:26.090 align:middle line:84%
network that allows those two
organs to as is one potent

00:26:26.090 --> 00:26:27.350 align:middle line:90%
mechanism.

00:26:27.350 --> 00:26:30.530 align:middle line:84%
When we harmonize the
heart and the brain,

00:26:30.530 --> 00:26:37.120 align:middle line:84%
we allow ourselves to harmonize
with our natural environment.

00:26:37.120 --> 00:26:40.634 align:middle line:84%
And it all comes
down to vibration.

00:26:40.634 --> 00:26:42.050 align:middle line:84%
Every moment of
every day, there's

00:26:42.050 --> 00:26:44.750 align:middle line:84%
a conversation between
our heart and our brain.

00:26:44.750 --> 00:26:46.390 align:middle line:84%
That conversation
can be measured

00:26:46.390 --> 00:26:47.390 align:middle line:90%
as an electrical signal.

00:26:47.390 --> 00:26:48.860 align:middle line:90%
It's a very low signal.

00:26:48.860 --> 00:26:52.550 align:middle line:84%
And when it's optimized,
it's 0.1 hertz.

00:26:52.550 --> 00:26:54.380 align:middle line:90%
It's a tenth of a hertz.

00:26:54.380 --> 00:26:56.720 align:middle line:90%
Can't even hear that.

00:26:56.720 --> 00:26:58.340 align:middle line:84%
This is the
frequency that whales

00:26:58.340 --> 00:27:00.360 align:middle line:90%
communicate with in the ocean.

00:27:00.360 --> 00:27:02.360 align:middle line:84%
It's the frequency that
military submarines use.

00:27:02.360 --> 00:27:04.850 align:middle line:84%
That's why it's a
problem for the whales.

00:27:04.850 --> 00:27:11.580 align:middle line:84%
When we can feel the feelings
and adjust our breathing

00:27:11.580 --> 00:27:17.120 align:middle line:84%
in a way that allows a 0.1
hertz signal between the heart

00:27:17.120 --> 00:27:21.530 align:middle line:84%
and the brain, we are
harmonizing our body

00:27:21.530 --> 00:27:23.700 align:middle line:90%
with our natural environment.

00:27:23.700 --> 00:27:26.900 align:middle line:84%
And rather than something that
we do every once in a while,

00:27:26.900 --> 00:27:28.100 align:middle line:90%
it's a way of being.

00:27:28.100 --> 00:27:30.120 align:middle line:90%
And our ancestors knew this.

00:27:30.120 --> 00:27:32.660 align:middle line:84%
They said this is
a way of living,

00:27:32.660 --> 00:27:35.300 align:middle line:84%
rather than an
activity that we do.

00:27:35.300 --> 00:27:38.900 align:middle line:84%
So for me personally, I
don't have a meditation

00:27:38.900 --> 00:27:40.130 align:middle line:90%
per se that I do every day.

00:27:40.130 --> 00:27:42.890 align:middle line:90%


00:27:42.890 --> 00:27:49.100 align:middle line:84%
Life is the meditation and a
mindfulness of other people,

00:27:49.100 --> 00:27:50.480 align:middle line:90%
my environment.

00:27:50.480 --> 00:27:51.900 align:middle line:90%
That is part of my practice.

00:27:51.900 --> 00:27:55.330 align:middle line:84%
And when I need to harmonize
my heart and my brain,

00:27:55.330 --> 00:27:57.440 align:middle line:84%
I do exactly what I
shared in Missing Links.

00:27:57.440 --> 00:28:01.460 align:middle line:84%
It's a breath, and an emotion,
a feeling-based process

00:28:01.460 --> 00:28:03.380 align:middle line:84%
that optimizes that
signal between the heart

00:28:03.380 --> 00:28:04.250 align:middle line:90%
and the brain.

00:28:04.250 --> 00:28:05.666 align:middle line:84%
So to answer the
question, I think

00:28:05.666 --> 00:28:07.730 align:middle line:84%
this is the best
thing we can do.

00:28:07.730 --> 00:28:09.360 align:middle line:84%
Because not only
is it good for us.

00:28:09.360 --> 00:28:11.870 align:middle line:84%
It's good for us and our
relationship to the environment

00:28:11.870 --> 00:28:12.859 align:middle line:90%
>> Thank you.

00:28:12.859 --> 00:28:14.400 align:middle line:84%
That's definitely
a call to meditate.

00:28:14.400 --> 00:28:15.210 align:middle line:90%
>> Does that make sense?

00:28:15.210 --> 00:28:16.010 align:middle line:90%
>> It does.

00:28:16.010 --> 00:28:19.070 align:middle line:84%
To meditate, to
show up and just be

00:28:19.070 --> 00:28:22.580 align:middle line:84%
aware of how we walk and
move in the environment,

00:28:22.580 --> 00:28:23.665 align:middle line:90%
and with each other.

00:28:23.665 --> 00:28:25.290 align:middle line:84%
>> Can I say something
else about that?

00:28:25.290 --> 00:28:25.460 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes

00:28:25.460 --> 00:28:28.050 align:middle line:84%
>> I spent a lot of time with
indigenous people in different

00:28:28.050 --> 00:28:28.850 align:middle line:90%
cultures.

00:28:28.850 --> 00:28:33.650 align:middle line:84%
Monks, nuns, abbots in
Tibet, Bolivia, Peru.

00:28:33.650 --> 00:28:37.500 align:middle line:84%
Indigenous peoples in
kivas and in prayer.

00:28:37.500 --> 00:28:39.990 align:middle line:84%
As different as they
are from one another,

00:28:39.990 --> 00:28:42.290 align:middle line:84%
one of the common threads
is that all of them,

00:28:42.290 --> 00:28:44.420 align:middle line:84%
in their own way, have
a way to harmonize

00:28:44.420 --> 00:28:46.260 align:middle line:90%
the heart and the brain.

00:28:46.260 --> 00:28:48.360 align:middle line:84%
So they learned this
a long time ago.

00:28:48.360 --> 00:28:50.900 align:middle line:84%
And I think rather than
thinking of it as something

00:28:50.900 --> 00:28:57.810 align:middle line:84%
we do on occasion to help
us at a certain time,

00:28:57.810 --> 00:28:59.780 align:middle line:84%
in health or immune
system or something

00:28:59.780 --> 00:29:03.020 align:middle line:84%
like that, if we can develop
a practice where this becomes

00:29:03.020 --> 00:29:05.840 align:middle line:84%
a way of being, where we're in
that state more often than not.

00:29:05.840 --> 00:29:07.692 align:middle line:84%
And I think it's our
natural state of being.

00:29:07.692 --> 00:29:09.650 align:middle line:84%
I think it's natural for
us to be in the states

00:29:09.650 --> 00:29:14.270 align:middle line:84%
when our intuition is tuned
to its highest degree, when

00:29:14.270 --> 00:29:16.814 align:middle line:84%
we learn the best,
super learning happens.

00:29:16.814 --> 00:29:18.980 align:middle line:84%
When we have direct access
to our subconscious, when

00:29:18.980 --> 00:29:22.190 align:middle line:84%
our immune system
at its strongest.

00:29:22.190 --> 00:29:24.960 align:middle line:84%
Rather than being an
extraordinary way of living,

00:29:24.960 --> 00:29:27.504 align:middle line:84%
I think it's an ordinary way
of living that we're only

00:29:27.504 --> 00:29:28.670 align:middle line:90%
now beginning to understand.

00:29:28.670 --> 00:29:29.960 align:middle line:90%
>> Thank you.

00:29:29.960 --> 00:29:32.030 align:middle line:84%
I wonder if we can take
the time for one more

00:29:32.030 --> 00:29:34.259 align:middle line:90%
question from Naomi Simmons.

00:29:34.259 --> 00:29:36.050 align:middle line:84%
She says, you mentioned
the code in our DNA

00:29:36.050 --> 00:29:38.180 align:middle line:84%
where you found a
message from our creator.

00:29:38.180 --> 00:29:40.097 align:middle line:84%
Have you also looked
into DNA of other species

00:29:40.097 --> 00:29:40.930 align:middle line:90%
and found this code?

00:29:40.930 --> 00:29:41.840 align:middle line:90%
>> Good question.

00:29:41.840 --> 00:29:45.290 align:middle line:84%
>> Is this message from beings
from our planet that may have

00:29:45.290 --> 00:29:46.310 align:middle line:90%
dabbled with DNA here?

00:29:46.310 --> 00:29:49.940 align:middle line:84%
>> So I asked the same question
that Naomi has just asked.

00:29:49.940 --> 00:29:51.980 align:middle line:90%
And so the bottom line is this.

00:29:51.980 --> 00:29:55.310 align:middle line:84%
The code that I found,
it took me 20 years

00:29:55.310 --> 00:30:00.240 align:middle line:84%
to find that code in
the DNA of humans.

00:30:00.240 --> 00:30:03.320 align:middle line:90%
It is in all carbon-based DNA.

00:30:03.320 --> 00:30:08.000 align:middle line:84%
That means that code is
fundamental in every form

00:30:08.000 --> 00:30:10.700 align:middle line:84%
of life that we know today
that is based in carbon.

00:30:10.700 --> 00:30:14.420 align:middle line:10%
So from a blade of grass to a
hamster to a goldfish, to a dog

00:30:14.420 --> 00:30:17.780 align:middle line:10%
to a cat to an ape,
when we interact

00:30:17.780 --> 00:30:20.720 align:middle line:10%
with life in another world,
if their DNA is carbon-based,

00:30:20.720 --> 00:30:22.430 align:middle line:10%
it will have the same message.

00:30:22.430 --> 00:30:24.110 align:middle line:90%
How did that message get there?

00:30:24.110 --> 00:30:25.760 align:middle line:84%
That's a topic for
another conversation

00:30:25.760 --> 00:30:27.260 align:middle line:84%
that I would love
to share with you.

00:30:27.260 --> 00:30:28.610 align:middle line:90%
>> Thank you so much, Gregg.

00:30:28.610 --> 00:30:29.290 align:middle line:90%
>> Thank you, Tiffany.

00:30:29.290 --> 00:30:30.590 align:middle line:84%
I've enjoyed it
tremendously today.

00:30:30.590 --> 00:30:31.390 align:middle line:90%
Thank you so much.

00:30:31.390 --> 00:30:33.020 align:middle line:10%
>> That's all we have for today.

00:30:33.020 --> 00:30:34.280 align:middle line:10%
I'm your host, Tiffany.

00:30:34.280 --> 00:30:36.104 align:middle line:84%
In the next episode,
we'll answer

00:30:36.104 --> 00:30:38.270 align:middle line:84%
