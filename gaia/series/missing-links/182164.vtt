We complete each
other's sentences.

>>BRADEN: Hi, my
name is Gregg Braden,

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:44.480 align:middle line:10%
and I want to welcome you
to this very special edition

00:00:44.480 --> 00:00:47.300 align:middle line:10%
of "Missing Links,"
where today I

00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:49.190 align:middle line:10%
am with a dear friend
and a colleague,

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:52.430 align:middle line:10%
a very special man who I've
had the opportunity to share

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:55.820 align:middle line:10%
the stage with on every
continent of the Earth for more

00:00:55.820 --> 00:00:59.330 align:middle line:10%
years than we can
remember right now.

00:00:59.330 --> 00:01:01.700 align:middle line:10%
We were recently invited to
speak at the United Nations

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:05.209 align:middle line:10%
as a team, sharing the new
discoveries that we have found

00:01:05.209 --> 00:01:07.580 align:middle line:10%
in our respective sciences
of the life and the earth

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:11.300 align:middle line:10%
sciences, what it means in
our world in our lives today.

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:12.167 align:middle line:10%
Dr. Bruce Lipton.

00:01:12.167 --> 00:01:14.250 align:middle line:10%
Bruce, I want to welcome
you to the program today.

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:17.030 align:middle line:84%
And I'm excited to
have this conversation,

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:20.720 align:middle line:84%
to pick up where we left off and
talk about the new discoveries

00:01:20.720 --> 00:01:24.140 align:middle line:84%
that are being made now that are
supporting what you and I have

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:26.493 align:middle line:84%
been sharing with the world
for over 30 years now.

00:01:26.493 --> 00:01:28.410 align:middle line:10%
>>LIPTON: Well, I'm
looking forward to it too,

00:01:28.410 --> 00:01:30.820 align:middle line:10%
because we're facing an
evolutionary upheaval

00:01:30.820 --> 00:01:31.620 align:middle line:10%
at this moment.

00:01:31.620 --> 00:01:33.950 align:middle line:84%
And the information we
have will facilitate

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:36.980 align:middle line:84%
us to go through this without
so much damage and struggle.

00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:38.870 align:middle line:84%
So I look forward
to the new science.

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:39.912 align:middle line:90%
>>BRADEN: Yeah, I do too.

00:01:39.912 --> 00:01:43.340 align:middle line:84%
You know, one of the things that
I've found in my live audiences

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:45.723 align:middle line:84%
that people really respond
to-- and I find this

00:01:45.723 --> 00:01:47.390 align:middle line:84%
true even in the
audiences where I'm not

00:01:47.390 --> 00:01:48.570 align:middle line:90%
speaking their language.

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:51.110 align:middle line:84%
So you've heard it said "a
picture is worth a thousand

00:01:51.110 --> 00:01:53.750 align:middle line:84%
words," and I've
found this to be true.

00:01:53.750 --> 00:01:57.050 align:middle line:10%
In the science of
cymatics, where

00:01:57.050 --> 00:02:00.020 align:middle line:10%
vibration is pumped
into a medium

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:03.140 align:middle line:10%
so that the medium
displays a pattern,

00:02:03.140 --> 00:02:06.440 align:middle line:10%
a pictorial representation
of that vibration,

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:08.300 align:middle line:10%
it tells us something
very interesting

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:12.268 align:middle line:10%
about the way that nature
brings about change

00:02:12.268 --> 00:02:14.060 align:middle line:10%
and the that nature
brings about evolution.

00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:16.880 align:middle line:84%
So let me just share it
briefly with our audience.

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:20.067 align:middle line:84%
If you're not familiar
with this, in the 1990s,

00:02:20.067 --> 00:02:20.900 align:middle line:90%
there was a science.

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:22.190 align:middle line:90%
It is called cymatics.

00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:26.330 align:middle line:84%
C-Y-M-A-T-I-C-S. Hans
Jenny, Dr. Hans Jenny,

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:28.790 align:middle line:84%
was the scientist that
brought this forward.

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:31.370 align:middle line:84%
And what he did was,
he took a medium.

00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:32.540 align:middle line:90%
Sometimes it was liquid.

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:35.180 align:middle line:90%
Sometimes it was a powder.

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:38.510 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes it was a very
viscous liquid, like mercury.

00:02:38.510 --> 00:02:40.760 align:middle line:90%
He put it in a specialized dish.

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:43.880 align:middle line:84%
And into this dish, he
would pump a vibration,

00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:45.990 align:middle line:90%
a very specific frequency.

00:02:45.990 --> 00:02:48.620 align:middle line:84%
And as the frequency would
increase or decrease,

00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:51.230 align:middle line:84%
a pattern would appear
in the dish that

00:02:51.230 --> 00:02:53.170 align:middle line:90%
correlated with that frequency.

00:02:53.170 --> 00:02:55.070 align:middle line:84%
And the reason this
is important is

00:02:55.070 --> 00:02:58.550 align:middle line:84%
because it gives us a really
powerful insight into way

00:02:58.550 --> 00:03:02.060 align:middle line:84%
that nature evolves
and accommodates

00:03:02.060 --> 00:03:03.630 align:middle line:90%
change in our world.

00:03:03.630 --> 00:03:06.500 align:middle line:84%
And what our audiences have
really found to be fascinating

00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:07.430 align:middle line:90%
is this--

00:03:07.430 --> 00:03:10.370 align:middle line:84%
we see these beautifully
complex patterns

00:03:10.370 --> 00:03:14.170 align:middle line:84%
look like flower petals and
sacred geometric designs.

00:03:14.170 --> 00:03:17.150 align:middle line:10%
And they are only sustainable
for a brief period of time.

00:03:17.150 --> 00:03:21.290 align:middle line:10%
And as the frequency
increases, those patterns,

00:03:21.290 --> 00:03:25.880 align:middle line:10%
they give way to a higher order,
to a more complex pattern.

00:03:25.880 --> 00:03:29.180 align:middle line:10%
However, to get there, the
whole thing has to break down.

00:03:29.180 --> 00:03:31.910 align:middle line:84%
Chaos giving way
to a higher order.

00:03:31.910 --> 00:03:35.990 align:middle line:84%
Now, I use this to illustrate to
people the very powerful image

00:03:35.990 --> 00:03:38.180 align:middle line:84%
of what is happening
in our lives

00:03:38.180 --> 00:03:40.517 align:middle line:84%
and what's happening
in our world today.

00:03:40.517 --> 00:03:42.350 align:middle line:10%
And I know you've seen
these images as well.

00:03:42.350 --> 00:03:43.760 align:middle line:10%
Do you think that's a
good representation?

00:03:43.760 --> 00:03:45.770 align:middle line:10%
Do we need the chaos to
get to a higher order?

00:03:45.770 --> 00:03:47.050 align:middle line:10%
>>LIPTON: Well, absolutely.

00:03:47.050 --> 00:03:49.180 align:middle line:10%
And let's separate
chaos from random.

00:03:49.180 --> 00:03:51.980 align:middle line:10%
Random means things are
just happening by accident.

00:03:51.980 --> 00:03:53.030 align:middle line:90%
You have no idea.

00:03:53.030 --> 00:03:56.000 align:middle line:84%
Chaos has a pattern, but
it's below our ability

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:57.760 align:middle line:90%
to see the details.

00:03:57.760 --> 00:04:00.270 align:middle line:84%
So it looks random
on the surface,

00:04:00.270 --> 00:04:01.970 align:middle line:84%
but if you understood
what was going on,

00:04:01.970 --> 00:04:04.820 align:middle line:84%
everything is moving according
to some particular plan.

00:04:04.820 --> 00:04:05.780 align:middle line:90%
>>BRADEN: Yeah.

00:04:05.780 --> 00:04:07.640 align:middle line:10%
>>LIPTON: An example
of that in real life

00:04:07.640 --> 00:04:10.320 align:middle line:10%
is when a butterfly,
a caterpillar,

00:04:10.320 --> 00:04:12.470 align:middle line:10%
has finished its maturation.

00:04:12.470 --> 00:04:14.930 align:middle line:84%
It creates a cocoon, and
it comes in one structure

00:04:14.930 --> 00:04:16.160 align:middle line:90%
as a caterpillar.

00:04:16.160 --> 00:04:18.777 align:middle line:84%
But it's going to move into
a structure of a butterfly.

00:04:18.777 --> 00:04:21.110 align:middle line:84%
Well, the same cells are going
to be in the caterpillar,

00:04:21.110 --> 00:04:23.210 align:middle line:84%
and they're also going to
contribute to the butterfly.

00:04:23.210 --> 00:04:24.120 align:middle line:90%
So how does it work?

00:04:24.120 --> 00:04:26.600 align:middle line:84%
And the answer
is, in the cocoon,

00:04:26.600 --> 00:04:30.230 align:middle line:84%
there's a breakdown of the
body of the caterpillar, where

00:04:30.230 --> 00:04:32.360 align:middle line:84%
the cells turn into like
a mush at some point.

00:04:32.360 --> 00:04:33.860 align:middle line:84%
>>BRADEN: Would you
call that chaos?

00:04:33.860 --> 00:04:34.760 align:middle line:84%
>>LIPTON: Well,
it's totally chaos.

00:04:34.760 --> 00:04:35.720 align:middle line:84%
Because if you look
at it, you say,

00:04:35.720 --> 00:04:37.430 align:middle line:84%
oh, the whole thing's
falling apart.

00:04:37.430 --> 00:04:40.130 align:middle line:84%
But on the other hand, as it's
falling apart, many of them

00:04:40.130 --> 00:04:42.470 align:middle line:84%
are also beginning to assemble
into the next structure

00:04:42.470 --> 00:04:43.680 align:middle line:90%
of the butterfly.

00:04:43.680 --> 00:04:45.537 align:middle line:84%
And so the point
is, on the surface,

00:04:45.537 --> 00:04:47.120 align:middle line:84%
it looks like it's
just falling apart.

00:04:47.120 --> 00:04:48.530 align:middle line:84%
But if you really
understood it, you

00:04:48.530 --> 00:04:50.120 align:middle line:84%
knew that these
cells from over here

00:04:50.120 --> 00:04:51.980 align:middle line:84%
are going to lose
this organization,

00:04:51.980 --> 00:04:54.870 align:middle line:84%
move, and then come into
this organization over here.

00:04:54.870 --> 00:04:58.730 align:middle line:84%
So between organization A
and B, the movement part

00:04:58.730 --> 00:05:01.760 align:middle line:84%
looks chaotic, looks
random, but it's chaotic.

00:05:01.760 --> 00:05:04.880 align:middle line:84%
Because all the cells know where
they're ultimately going to go.

00:05:04.880 --> 00:05:06.740 align:middle line:84%
And this is important
for us to understand

00:05:06.740 --> 00:05:09.080 align:middle line:84%
in our own particular
world for a simple reason.

00:05:09.080 --> 00:05:11.910 align:middle line:84%
We are facing what is called
the sixth mass extinction.

00:05:11.910 --> 00:05:14.030 align:middle line:84%
And it's due to human
behavior, the way we treat

00:05:14.030 --> 00:05:16.280 align:middle line:90%
Mother Nature and the planet.

00:05:16.280 --> 00:05:19.580 align:middle line:84%
And basically, the quote that
I used in a lecture and we used

00:05:19.580 --> 00:05:22.400 align:middle line:84%
it before it was "you cannot
solve the problems with

00:05:22.400 --> 00:05:24.830 align:middle line:84%
the same thinking that
created the problems."

00:05:24.830 --> 00:05:27.350 align:middle line:84%
And basically it says that
the civilization we're in

00:05:27.350 --> 00:05:31.550 align:middle line:84%
is the one whose culture
and behavior has caused

00:05:31.550 --> 00:05:33.330 align:middle line:90%
the sixth mass extinction.

00:05:33.330 --> 00:05:35.540 align:middle line:84%
So we have to take this
structure, the existing

00:05:35.540 --> 00:05:39.390 align:middle line:84%
structure, and transform
it into a more thrivable

00:05:39.390 --> 00:05:40.680 align:middle line:90%
whole structure.

00:05:40.680 --> 00:05:42.600 align:middle line:84%
And just like in
cymatics or just

00:05:42.600 --> 00:05:45.390 align:middle line:84%
like in the butterfly
and the caterpillar,

00:05:45.390 --> 00:05:49.345 align:middle line:84%
the old structure must fall
down so to build a new one.

00:05:49.345 --> 00:05:50.220 align:middle line:90%
>>BRADEN: Absolutely.

00:05:50.220 --> 00:05:52.803 align:middle line:84%
>>LIPTON: But if you're in the
middle of this, all you can see

00:05:52.803 --> 00:05:54.720 align:middle line:84%
is, oh, my god, this
thing is falling down.

00:05:54.720 --> 00:05:56.700 align:middle line:90%
I'm scared.

00:05:56.700 --> 00:05:59.575 align:middle line:84%
And the reality about
it is that, yeah, it

00:05:59.575 --> 00:06:01.200 align:middle line:84%
provokes a lot of
fear in people to see

00:06:01.200 --> 00:06:03.093 align:middle line:90%
the world go in this upheaval.

00:06:03.093 --> 00:06:05.760 align:middle line:84%
But if you understand this, this
upheaval is not a random event.

00:06:05.760 --> 00:06:08.160 align:middle line:84%
It's a required event to
build another civilization,

00:06:08.160 --> 00:06:10.680 align:middle line:84%
but not on the existing
foundation of the one

00:06:10.680 --> 00:06:12.960 align:middle line:84%
we have, because that's
where the problems come from.

00:06:12.960 --> 00:06:14.835 align:middle line:84%
So when you look out at
the world and you go,

00:06:14.835 --> 00:06:16.950 align:middle line:84%
chaos, and a lot of people
are like, oh my god,

00:06:16.950 --> 00:06:21.480 align:middle line:84%
the world I know
is disappearing,

00:06:21.480 --> 00:06:23.270 align:middle line:84%
I have to say this
very seriously.

00:06:23.270 --> 00:06:25.770 align:middle line:84%
Thank god, because if you look
out the window and everything

00:06:25.770 --> 00:06:27.630 align:middle line:84%
stayed the same,
that says, man, we're

00:06:27.630 --> 00:06:30.010 align:middle line:84%
going to go into that
extinction even faster.

00:06:30.010 --> 00:06:32.550 align:middle line:84%
So chaos is a very
positive sign,

00:06:32.550 --> 00:06:35.850 align:middle line:84%
because it says we are moving
out of an existing system that

00:06:35.850 --> 00:06:39.000 align:middle line:84%
is causing a problem, and
in the process creating

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:41.895 align:middle line:84%
a new system that will allow
us to thrive into the future.

00:06:41.895 --> 00:06:42.770 align:middle line:90%
>>BRADEN: Absolutely.

00:06:42.770 --> 00:06:44.187 align:middle line:84%
You know, one of
the things I see,

00:06:44.187 --> 00:06:47.160 align:middle line:84%
we have the benefit of
standing on a stage looking

00:06:47.160 --> 00:06:50.040 align:middle line:84%
at the faces of hundreds,
sometimes thousands of people

00:06:50.040 --> 00:06:53.990 align:middle line:84%
as we see them subconsciously
respond to what

00:06:53.990 --> 00:06:54.990 align:middle line:90%
it is that we're saying.

00:06:54.990 --> 00:06:58.170 align:middle line:84%
And one of the things that
I've found so fascinating,

00:06:58.170 --> 00:07:00.606 align:middle line:84%
no matter what the
culture or the language,

00:07:00.606 --> 00:07:03.660 align:middle line:84%
is that when people begin
to see the only things that

00:07:03.660 --> 00:07:07.110 align:middle line:84%
are in chaos right now, the only
systems that are breaking down,

00:07:07.110 --> 00:07:08.863 align:middle line:84%
are the systems that
are unsustainable.

00:07:08.863 --> 00:07:10.530 align:middle line:84%
There are a lot of
good things happening

00:07:10.530 --> 00:07:11.590 align:middle line:90%
that are very sustainable.

00:07:11.590 --> 00:07:13.200 align:middle line:84%
We're not hearing about them,
because they're not a problem.

00:07:13.200 --> 00:07:13.710 align:middle line:90%
>>LIPTON: Right.

00:07:13.710 --> 00:07:16.380 align:middle line:84%
>>BRADEN: But the unsustainable
systems are breaking down.

00:07:16.380 --> 00:07:18.290 align:middle line:84%
When we go back
to that cymatics,

00:07:18.290 --> 00:07:20.310 align:middle line:84%
I did an experiment
a few years ago,

00:07:20.310 --> 00:07:24.210 align:middle line:84%
and I tried it with an audience
that was a non-English speaking

00:07:24.210 --> 00:07:25.620 align:middle line:90%
audience.

00:07:25.620 --> 00:07:27.520 align:middle line:84%
Because I felt that
if it worked there,

00:07:27.520 --> 00:07:29.070 align:middle line:84%
it would probably
work everywhere.

00:07:29.070 --> 00:07:32.310 align:middle line:84%
And what I did was, I took
one of the cymatics images.

00:07:32.310 --> 00:07:34.650 align:middle line:84%
But rather than looking
at the entire image,

00:07:34.650 --> 00:07:38.110 align:middle line:84%
I zeroed in on a
portion of the image.

00:07:38.110 --> 00:07:40.050 align:middle line:84%
And when we looked
only at that piece,

00:07:40.050 --> 00:07:43.050 align:middle line:84%
it looked like the thing
was just in total chaos,

00:07:43.050 --> 00:07:45.120 align:middle line:90%
just totally falling apart.

00:07:45.120 --> 00:07:47.650 align:middle line:90%
No order whatsoever.

00:07:47.650 --> 00:07:51.150 align:middle line:84%
And when we stepped back to
a greater perspective, looked

00:07:51.150 --> 00:07:53.610 align:middle line:84%
at the big picture, we
could see that the change

00:07:53.610 --> 00:07:56.957 align:middle line:84%
we'd been looking at was
actually part of a pattern.

00:07:56.957 --> 00:07:59.040 align:middle line:84%
And it was a pattern that
was unfolding on a level

00:07:59.040 --> 00:08:03.480 align:middle line:84%
that we simply could not see
from our perspective of where

00:08:03.480 --> 00:08:05.388 align:middle line:90%
we were in that cymatics image.

00:08:05.388 --> 00:08:07.680 align:middle line:84%
And I think that is a very
powerful metaphor for what's

00:08:07.680 --> 00:08:10.850 align:middle line:90%
happening in the world today.

00:08:10.850 --> 00:08:15.510 align:middle line:84%
And it's easy to be
inundated with media 24/7,

00:08:15.510 --> 00:08:18.360 align:middle line:84%
with very biased
perspectives inundating

00:08:18.360 --> 00:08:22.020 align:middle line:84%
us to see these very specific
ways of looking at the world.

00:08:22.020 --> 00:08:24.280 align:middle line:84%
But if we can take a
breath, take a deep breath,

00:08:24.280 --> 00:08:27.240 align:middle line:84%
step back, look at
the big picture,

00:08:27.240 --> 00:08:28.740 align:middle line:84%
I think what we're
going to find is,

00:08:28.740 --> 00:08:32.490 align:middle line:84%
we are living this pivotal,
rare, precious moment

00:08:32.490 --> 00:08:36.880 align:middle line:84%
in the history of civilization
and of human evolution--

00:08:36.880 --> 00:08:38.580 align:middle line:90%
the evolution of consciousness.

00:08:38.580 --> 00:08:41.700 align:middle line:84%
Because we're being asked to
think and live differently,

00:08:41.700 --> 00:08:45.390 align:middle line:84%
more so now than perhaps we ever
have in our lifetimes for sure,

00:08:45.390 --> 00:08:47.530 align:middle line:84%
so that we can
accommodate that change.

00:08:47.530 --> 00:08:49.650 align:middle line:84%
And the important
thing about the chaos

00:08:49.650 --> 00:08:51.900 align:middle line:84%
is, when the system
breaks down the chaos,

00:08:51.900 --> 00:08:54.560 align:middle line:84%
it doesn't always go
back to square one.

00:08:54.560 --> 00:08:56.190 align:middle line:84%
Like, you have to
start all over.

00:08:56.190 --> 00:09:01.140 align:middle line:84%
The chaos gives way to a more
complex system, a higher order,

00:09:01.140 --> 00:09:04.313 align:middle line:84%
a more beautiful pattern if
you're looking at the cymatics.

00:09:04.313 --> 00:09:05.730 align:middle line:84%
And I think it's
important to have

00:09:05.730 --> 00:09:07.535 align:middle line:84%
that visual anchor
for people when

00:09:07.535 --> 00:09:08.910 align:middle line:84%
they think about
what's happening

00:09:08.910 --> 00:09:10.747 align:middle line:84%
in their own lives
in their world today.

00:09:10.747 --> 00:09:12.330 align:middle line:84%
>>LIPTON: Well, I
also agree with you,

00:09:12.330 --> 00:09:14.220 align:middle line:84%
because as I said, if you
just look out the window

00:09:14.220 --> 00:09:16.410 align:middle line:84%
and you look at what's going
on, it could scare the heck out

00:09:16.410 --> 00:09:17.330 align:middle line:90%
of you.

00:09:17.330 --> 00:09:19.260 align:middle line:84%
And the simple reality is,
but if you understand what's

00:09:19.260 --> 00:09:21.630 align:middle line:84%
going on and you look out the
window, you go, this is good,

00:09:21.630 --> 00:09:24.005 align:middle line:84%
because this is going to help
us get into this other more

00:09:24.005 --> 00:09:24.900 align:middle line:90%
sustainable place.

00:09:24.900 --> 00:09:27.230 align:middle line:84%
And it's very important to
comment on what you said.

00:09:27.230 --> 00:09:28.480 align:middle line:90%
It was a very important point.

00:09:28.480 --> 00:09:30.930 align:middle line:84%
And that is, everything
doesn't have to fall apart.

00:09:30.930 --> 00:09:35.100 align:middle line:84%
Evolution takes what was really
good and passes it along.

00:09:35.100 --> 00:09:37.770 align:middle line:84%
But the things that are
corrupt are the things

00:09:37.770 --> 00:09:41.830 align:middle line:84%
that will not go from
evolution A into evolution B.

00:09:41.830 --> 00:09:44.670 align:middle line:84%
So some things are
indeed falling down,

00:09:44.670 --> 00:09:46.890 align:middle line:84%
and they need to fall
down, as you mentioned.

00:09:46.890 --> 00:09:49.410 align:middle line:84%
And other things that are
going to go right through,

00:09:49.410 --> 00:09:51.243 align:middle line:84%
because they've
always been that way

00:09:51.243 --> 00:09:52.410 align:middle line:90%
and are consistent and good.

00:09:52.410 --> 00:09:54.202 align:middle line:84%
>>BRADEN: You know, as
scientists, I agree.

00:09:54.202 --> 00:09:56.250 align:middle line:84%
And scientists, we
have the benefit

00:09:56.250 --> 00:09:59.460 align:middle line:84%
of having the training
and the discipline

00:09:59.460 --> 00:10:01.990 align:middle line:84%
to think as scientists,
but also the open--

00:10:01.990 --> 00:10:04.660 align:middle line:84%
I like to say I have an open
mind, but not a gaping mind.

00:10:04.660 --> 00:10:08.550 align:middle line:84%
So my mind is open
to new ideas that

00:10:08.550 --> 00:10:10.890 align:middle line:84%
are based on something
that I know to be true,

00:10:10.890 --> 00:10:13.710 align:middle line:84%
but not just any
willy nilly idea of it

00:10:13.710 --> 00:10:15.750 align:middle line:84%
or theory, conspiracy
theory, whatever

00:10:15.750 --> 00:10:17.950 align:middle line:90%
that happens to come along.

00:10:17.950 --> 00:10:20.730 align:middle line:84%
And so where this is really
interesting to me is,

00:10:20.730 --> 00:10:24.510 align:middle line:84%
we have these perspectives as
scientists in the discipline.

00:10:24.510 --> 00:10:27.540 align:middle line:84%
And we also have
the vocabulary, so

00:10:27.540 --> 00:10:31.730 align:middle line:84%
that we can look at scientific
and technical journals

00:10:31.730 --> 00:10:33.660 align:middle line:84%
that a layperson
sometimes may not

00:10:33.660 --> 00:10:35.850 align:middle line:84%
be able to interpret
or understand well,

00:10:35.850 --> 00:10:37.870 align:middle line:84%
because it's written
in, you know,

00:10:37.870 --> 00:10:39.500 align:middle line:90%
almost a foreign language.

00:10:39.500 --> 00:10:43.630 align:middle line:10%
And those new discoveries
of the best science

00:10:43.630 --> 00:10:47.038 align:middle line:10%
of the 21st century are actually
supporting all the ideas

00:10:47.038 --> 00:10:48.580 align:middle line:10%
that you and I have
talked about when

00:10:48.580 --> 00:10:52.810 align:middle line:10%
it comes to nature is based in
cooperation versus competition,

00:10:52.810 --> 00:10:58.360 align:middle line:10%
and the reason for chaos to give
way to a higher order, where

00:10:58.360 --> 00:11:01.480 align:middle line:10%
the old ideas, the Darwinian
ideas of evolution,

00:11:01.480 --> 00:11:02.590 align:middle line:10%
are breaking down.

00:11:02.590 --> 00:11:04.720 align:middle line:84%
We keep seeing discovery
after discovery

00:11:04.720 --> 00:11:07.810 align:middle line:84%
after discovery that is
validating those ideas we've

00:11:07.810 --> 00:11:10.120 align:middle line:90%
been sharing for over 20 years.

00:11:10.120 --> 00:11:12.790 align:middle line:84%
And I just want to give you
the opportunity, are there

00:11:12.790 --> 00:11:16.330 align:middle line:84%
any discoveries that really
come to mind recently that are--

00:11:16.330 --> 00:11:19.107 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it's like, yeah,
there it is, you know?

00:11:19.107 --> 00:11:21.190 align:middle line:84%
>>LIPTON: Well, I guess
"recently" is a hard word,

00:11:21.190 --> 00:11:22.660 align:middle line:84%
because some
discoveries happened

00:11:22.660 --> 00:11:24.560 align:middle line:84%
but nobody paid attention
to it for a number of years.

00:11:24.560 --> 00:11:26.060 align:middle line:84%
And now all of a
sudden, they see reason.

00:11:26.060 --> 00:11:28.270 align:middle line:84%
It was like, well, that was
100 years ago or so, when

00:11:28.270 --> 00:11:29.812 align:middle line:84%
quantum physics is
the first one that

00:11:29.812 --> 00:11:33.910 align:middle line:84%
says that first of
all, our illusion

00:11:33.910 --> 00:11:36.850 align:middle line:84%
of a material physical
world is an illusion.

00:11:36.850 --> 00:11:39.820 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't Exist which
is mind-boggling.

00:11:39.820 --> 00:11:41.770 align:middle line:84%
Most people can't
even jump into that.

00:11:41.770 --> 00:11:46.240 align:middle line:84%
But as the quantum
physicists in 1925,

00:11:46.240 --> 00:11:48.760 align:middle line:84%
that was the first
premise they came in.

00:11:48.760 --> 00:11:52.180 align:middle line:84%
Consciousness is creating
our life experiences.

00:11:52.180 --> 00:11:53.990 align:middle line:84%
Well, this becomes
a scientific fact.

00:11:53.990 --> 00:11:55.210 align:middle line:84%
And I say, well, if it's
a scientific fact, what

00:11:55.210 --> 00:11:55.870 align:middle line:90%
does it mean?

00:11:55.870 --> 00:11:58.005 align:middle line:84%
Well, it says, well, what if
we change our consciousness?

00:11:58.005 --> 00:11:59.800 align:middle line:84%
Then the answer is, then
we change our reality.

00:11:59.800 --> 00:12:01.550 align:middle line:84%
And all of a sudden,
it's like, oh, great.

00:12:01.550 --> 00:12:03.523 align:middle line:84%
So it's a lot easier
to change consciousness

00:12:03.523 --> 00:12:05.440 align:middle line:84%
than to go out there and
then change and build

00:12:05.440 --> 00:12:08.230 align:middle line:84%
a whole new world, because
just by changing consciousness,

00:12:08.230 --> 00:12:09.400 align:middle line:90%
a new world will manifest.

00:12:09.400 --> 00:12:11.440 align:middle line:84%
So to me, that's a
really important one,

00:12:11.440 --> 00:12:13.090 align:middle line:84%
because quantum
physics not only brings

00:12:13.090 --> 00:12:15.080 align:middle line:84%
in mind and consciousness
as a source,

00:12:15.080 --> 00:12:17.530 align:middle line:84%
but it also says there's no
such thing as separation,

00:12:17.530 --> 00:12:19.770 align:middle line:84%
which is what Newtonian
physics always talked about.

00:12:19.770 --> 00:12:20.950 align:middle line:90%
I can separate the pieces.

00:12:20.950 --> 00:12:23.710 align:middle line:84%
But quantum physics says
everything is energy.

00:12:23.710 --> 00:12:25.150 align:middle line:90%
Everything's entangled.

00:12:25.150 --> 00:12:27.700 align:middle line:84%
And this becomes important,
because we created a world

00:12:27.700 --> 00:12:29.350 align:middle line:90%
based on separation.

00:12:29.350 --> 00:12:32.470 align:middle line:84%
And that separation
is so out of alignment

00:12:32.470 --> 00:12:36.040 align:middle line:84%
with science in this point
that the way to come back

00:12:36.040 --> 00:12:38.320 align:middle line:84%
is to bring back
harmony and community.

00:12:38.320 --> 00:12:41.860 align:middle line:84%
So part of the chaos, and
you see the breaking down

00:12:41.860 --> 00:12:44.590 align:middle line:84%
of barriers, the breaking
down of old religious beliefs

00:12:44.590 --> 00:12:47.770 align:middle line:84%
and racial separation
and all that, these

00:12:47.770 --> 00:12:49.750 align:middle line:84%
are very positive
changes, because what

00:12:49.750 --> 00:12:52.570 align:middle line:84%
they mean was, we break
down a separation,

00:12:52.570 --> 00:12:54.880 align:middle line:84%
it is the first opportunity
to bring the community back

00:12:54.880 --> 00:12:55.930 align:middle line:90%
to wholeness.

00:12:55.930 --> 00:12:59.500 align:middle line:84%
And that is the drive force
of evolution at this moment.

00:12:59.500 --> 00:13:01.300 align:middle line:84%
And therefore, when
you look at the world,

00:13:01.300 --> 00:13:03.490 align:middle line:84%
it's like, I just want
people to understand

00:13:03.490 --> 00:13:07.510 align:middle line:84%
that it may look crazy out
there, and it does look crazy,

00:13:07.510 --> 00:13:09.220 align:middle line:90%
but this is not random.

00:13:09.220 --> 00:13:12.400 align:middle line:84%
This is an exact
movement to take us

00:13:12.400 --> 00:13:16.150 align:middle line:84%
from a non-sustainable
situation into a world

00:13:16.150 --> 00:13:18.220 align:middle line:84%
that we can live
into the future with.

00:13:18.220 --> 00:13:20.020 align:middle line:84%
So looking out
the window, please

00:13:20.020 --> 00:13:22.430 align:middle line:90%
don't be afraid of the change.

00:13:22.430 --> 00:13:25.958 align:middle line:84%
The change is what we need
to survive on this planet.

00:13:25.958 --> 00:13:27.250 align:middle line:90%
>>BRADEN: Well, I agree, Bruce.

00:13:27.250 --> 00:13:30.340 align:middle line:84%
And I think this is where the
value of what you and I are

00:13:30.340 --> 00:13:33.610 align:middle line:84%
doing, and so many others do
so beautifully, where it really

00:13:33.610 --> 00:13:37.330 align:middle line:84%
comes together, is
because what we're finding

00:13:37.330 --> 00:13:40.810 align:middle line:84%
is the more that people become
aware of the things we're

00:13:40.810 --> 00:13:43.550 align:middle line:84%
talking about, not
gonna stop the change,

00:13:43.550 --> 00:13:47.400 align:middle line:84%
but we can embrace the
change in a healthy way,

00:13:47.400 --> 00:13:50.620 align:middle line:84%
and maybe in a
more graceful way.

00:13:50.620 --> 00:13:52.190 align:middle line:90%
And I think that's important.

00:13:52.190 --> 00:13:53.740 align:middle line:90%
>>LIPTON: I agree with this.

00:13:53.740 --> 00:13:57.970 align:middle line:84%
It's so important to recognize
that what's happening

00:13:57.970 --> 00:14:02.800 align:middle line:84%
is so positive in the face
of what looks so negative.

00:14:02.800 --> 00:14:04.660 align:middle line:90%
But knowledge is power.

00:14:04.660 --> 00:14:07.780 align:middle line:84%
And when people don't have
that knowledge, deprived

00:14:07.780 --> 00:14:10.360 align:middle line:84%
of knowledge,
basically the corollary

00:14:10.360 --> 00:14:12.460 align:middle line:84%
of "knowledge of power"
is "a lack of knowledge

00:14:12.460 --> 00:14:14.020 align:middle line:90%
is a lack of power."

00:14:14.020 --> 00:14:16.300 align:middle line:84%
And systematically,
the population

00:14:16.300 --> 00:14:18.130 align:middle line:84%
has been deprived of
all this new science

00:14:18.130 --> 00:14:20.500 align:middle line:84%
that you and I are
offering at the front.

00:14:20.500 --> 00:14:23.290 align:middle line:84%
Because with this new
science comes some very

00:14:23.290 --> 00:14:25.540 align:middle line:84%
profound knowledge,
and that also

00:14:25.540 --> 00:14:27.820 align:middle line:90%
means very profound empowerment.

00:14:27.820 --> 00:14:31.030 align:middle line:84%
And this is what is the
drive force of evolution--

00:14:31.030 --> 00:14:32.502 align:middle line:90%
consciousness, as you mentioned.

00:14:32.502 --> 00:14:34.960 align:middle line:84%
Which is completely different
than the conventional science

00:14:34.960 --> 00:14:38.920 align:middle line:84%
that has always said genes are
the foundation of evolution.

00:14:38.920 --> 00:14:42.250 align:middle line:84%
It turns out after the Human
Genome Project, the whole idea

00:14:42.250 --> 00:14:45.580 align:middle line:84%
of genes and evolution
crash, because humans

00:14:45.580 --> 00:14:47.350 align:middle line:84%
have about 20,000
genes, which is

00:14:47.350 --> 00:14:50.230 align:middle line:84%
the same number of genes
in a half millimeter

00:14:50.230 --> 00:14:51.910 align:middle line:90%
worm that has 1,200 cells.

00:14:51.910 --> 00:14:54.460 align:middle line:90%
We've got 50 trillion cells.

00:14:54.460 --> 00:14:57.400 align:middle line:84%
The worm has 1,271
cells, and we both

00:14:57.400 --> 00:14:59.000 align:middle line:90%
have the same number of genes.

00:14:59.000 --> 00:15:00.790 align:middle line:84%
So basically, it
says, well, then I

00:15:00.790 --> 00:15:02.790 align:middle line:84%
can't score human
evolution on genes.

00:15:02.790 --> 00:15:05.020 align:middle line:84%
We've got the same
number as the worm.

00:15:05.020 --> 00:15:08.380 align:middle line:84%
So it turns out consciousness--
and this is really

00:15:08.380 --> 00:15:11.350 align:middle line:84%
the important part,
because consciousness,

00:15:11.350 --> 00:15:13.742 align:middle line:84%
we are free to create
our consciousness.

00:15:13.742 --> 00:15:15.700 align:middle line:84%
And if we are free to
create our consciousness,

00:15:15.700 --> 00:15:18.700 align:middle line:90%
then we are powerful creators.

00:15:18.700 --> 00:15:21.250 align:middle line:84%
But we have to give
information, because most people

00:15:21.250 --> 00:15:22.950 align:middle line:90%
feel they're victims.

00:15:22.950 --> 00:15:26.830 align:middle line:84%
>>BRADEN: You know, there
is a new way of thinking

00:15:26.830 --> 00:15:30.170 align:middle line:84%
that is emerging in the realm
originally of philosophy,

00:15:30.170 --> 00:15:34.120 align:middle line:84%
and now it's gaining traction
in many of the hard sciences,

00:15:34.120 --> 00:15:39.630 align:middle line:84%
that consciousness informs
itself through its creations.

00:15:39.630 --> 00:15:43.420 align:middle line:84%
And I love this, because
if it's true, it suggests--

00:15:43.420 --> 00:15:45.630 align:middle line:84%
and I believe this is
true, as I've seen it now--

00:15:45.630 --> 00:15:51.580 align:middle line:84%
it suggests that what we see
around us art, music, film,

00:15:51.580 --> 00:15:55.230 align:middle line:84%
books, the movies
that we create,

00:15:55.230 --> 00:15:59.100 align:middle line:84%
in addition to entertaining us,
that this is consciousness's

00:15:59.100 --> 00:16:03.300 align:middle line:84%
way of communicating
to consciousness,

00:16:03.300 --> 00:16:08.260 align:middle line:84%
to itself, reminding
us of something,

00:16:08.260 --> 00:16:11.305 align:middle line:84%
or some things, deep
truths of our existence

00:16:11.305 --> 00:16:13.680 align:middle line:84%
that are being mirrored back
to us through our creations.

00:16:13.680 --> 00:16:15.750 align:middle line:84%
So with that idea
in mind, I look

00:16:15.750 --> 00:16:18.690 align:middle line:84%
at the films that
are really touching

00:16:18.690 --> 00:16:24.030 align:middle line:84%
people's hearts on such a deep
level, blockbuster movies.

00:16:24.030 --> 00:16:26.315 align:middle line:90%
They call them science fiction.

00:16:26.315 --> 00:16:28.440 align:middle line:84%
You and I sometimes think
of them as documentaries.

00:16:28.440 --> 00:16:29.815 align:middle line:84%
>>LIPTON:
Documentaries for sure.

00:16:29.815 --> 00:16:31.560 align:middle line:84%
>>BRADEN: But some
that come to mind,

00:16:31.560 --> 00:16:32.970 align:middle line:90%
"Avatar," the movie "Avatar."

00:16:32.970 --> 00:16:33.240 align:middle line:90%
>>LIPTON: Yeah.

00:16:33.240 --> 00:16:34.080 align:middle line:10%
>>BRADEN: Very, very powerful.

00:16:34.080 --> 00:16:34.860 align:middle line:10%
"The Matrix."

00:16:34.860 --> 00:16:36.985 align:middle line:10%
>>LIPTON: "Matrix" was a
very powerful documentary.

00:16:36.985 --> 00:16:38.010 align:middle line:10%
>>BRADEN: The first one.

00:16:38.010 --> 00:16:40.050 align:middle line:10%
The movie "Inception"
about dreams

00:16:40.050 --> 00:16:41.960 align:middle line:10%
within dreams within dreams.

00:16:41.960 --> 00:16:43.710 align:middle line:10%
These kinds of films,
as different as they

00:16:43.710 --> 00:16:45.900 align:middle line:10%
are from one another,
the common theme

00:16:45.900 --> 00:16:48.420 align:middle line:10%
is they're all telling us
that there's something, first

00:16:48.420 --> 00:16:53.850 align:middle line:10%
some untapped potential
within us, that if realized,

00:16:53.850 --> 00:16:58.710 align:middle line:10%
empowers us to embrace
not just survive

00:16:58.710 --> 00:17:02.580 align:middle line:10%
through a difficult time,
but to thrive and evolve

00:17:02.580 --> 00:17:05.160 align:middle line:10%
into something very
new and very different.

00:17:05.160 --> 00:17:06.260 align:middle line:90%
It tells us that.

00:17:06.260 --> 00:17:09.119 align:middle line:84%
And also "Avatar" was
so powerful with this.

00:17:09.119 --> 00:17:11.099 align:middle line:84%
It tells us about
the deep connection

00:17:11.099 --> 00:17:15.020 align:middle line:84%
that we have to all life,
to the Earth, to the planet.

00:17:15.020 --> 00:17:17.940 align:middle line:84%
And now the new discoveries
of plants themselves

00:17:17.940 --> 00:17:19.980 align:middle line:84%
are mirroring precisely
the principles

00:17:19.980 --> 00:17:21.347 align:middle line:90%
that "Avatar" shared with us.

00:17:21.347 --> 00:17:22.680 align:middle line:90%
Have you found those to be true?

00:17:22.680 --> 00:17:23.339 align:middle line:90%
>>LIPTON: Absolutely true.

00:17:23.339 --> 00:17:25.960 align:middle line:84%
What's interesting is that when
we look at plants and we say,

00:17:25.960 --> 00:17:27.502 align:middle line:84%
oh, there's a tree
and there's a tree

00:17:27.502 --> 00:17:29.420 align:middle line:84%
and we separate them as
individual trees, what

00:17:29.420 --> 00:17:31.440 align:middle line:84%
we haven't seen is,
underneath the ground

00:17:31.440 --> 00:17:34.410 align:middle line:84%
all these trees are connected,
even different species.

00:17:34.410 --> 00:17:35.910 align:middle line:90%
They're all connected.

00:17:35.910 --> 00:17:40.380 align:middle line:84%
And mushrooms, fungus,
create pipelines

00:17:40.380 --> 00:17:42.840 align:middle line:90%
that connect the plants.

00:17:42.840 --> 00:17:45.690 align:middle line:84%
So when you look in a forest,
it looks like a whole bunch

00:17:45.690 --> 00:17:46.590 align:middle line:90%
of individual trees.

00:17:46.590 --> 00:17:48.300 align:middle line:84%
But if you could look
under the ground,

00:17:48.300 --> 00:17:50.080 align:middle line:84%
they're all connected
to each other.

00:17:50.080 --> 00:17:51.900 align:middle line:90%
It's a giant single organism.

00:17:51.900 --> 00:17:54.490 align:middle line:84%
And we are part of
that matrix as well.

00:17:54.490 --> 00:17:57.260 align:middle line:84%
And it's really information,
because plants, we always

00:17:57.260 --> 00:17:59.010 align:middle line:84%
look at them, oh,
animals are intelligent.

00:17:59.010 --> 00:18:00.843 align:middle line:84%
Plants are just those
things that sit there.

00:18:00.843 --> 00:18:03.180 align:middle line:84%
And I go, no, they
are so intelligent.

00:18:03.180 --> 00:18:05.140 align:middle line:84%
They communicate with
each other all the time.

00:18:05.140 --> 00:18:08.860 align:middle line:84%
And so if a disease is coming
from one side of the forest,

00:18:08.860 --> 00:18:11.070 align:middle line:84%
the first trees that
get that disease

00:18:11.070 --> 00:18:14.730 align:middle line:84%
send down information
already via the networks

00:18:14.730 --> 00:18:18.300 align:middle line:84%
of the mycelium, of the
fungus, or through pheromones,

00:18:18.300 --> 00:18:20.910 align:middle line:84%
soluble hormones that
go through the air.

00:18:20.910 --> 00:18:25.530 align:middle line:84%
And they can inform the forest
about a problem that's coming.

00:18:25.530 --> 00:18:28.170 align:middle line:84%
And the other plants
in that forest

00:18:28.170 --> 00:18:31.830 align:middle line:84%
will start to create behaviors
that will protect them

00:18:31.830 --> 00:18:33.040 align:middle line:90%
from this thing.

00:18:33.040 --> 00:18:35.910 align:middle line:84%
So the idea is that they're
always communicating.

00:18:35.910 --> 00:18:38.820 align:middle line:84%
And one interesting one is,
plants communicate with people,

00:18:38.820 --> 00:18:40.840 align:middle line:84%
but people don't
recognize it yet.

00:18:40.840 --> 00:18:44.610 align:middle line:84%
And they found out that
a person who grows plants

00:18:44.610 --> 00:18:48.930 align:middle line:84%
in their house, let's say, the
plants identify the vibration,

00:18:48.930 --> 00:18:50.550 align:middle line:90%
the energy of that person.

00:18:50.550 --> 00:18:52.500 align:middle line:84%
When that person
shows up in the room,

00:18:52.500 --> 00:18:56.100 align:middle line:84%
the plants release pheromones,
soluble hormones, in the air.

00:18:56.100 --> 00:18:57.100 align:middle line:90%
To do what?

00:18:57.100 --> 00:18:59.430 align:middle line:84%
Bring that entity
over, because that's

00:18:59.430 --> 00:19:02.550 align:middle line:84%
the entity that services them,
gives them water and nutrition

00:19:02.550 --> 00:19:03.490 align:middle line:90%
and all that.

00:19:03.490 --> 00:19:05.460 align:middle line:84%
So when that energy
walks into the room,

00:19:05.460 --> 00:19:08.880 align:middle line:84%
the plants know that energy,
release the pheromones

00:19:08.880 --> 00:19:10.922 align:middle line:84%
with the intention of
"come and take care of me."

00:19:10.922 --> 00:19:13.088 align:middle line:84%
And it's interesting, because
if somebody else walks

00:19:13.088 --> 00:19:15.390 align:middle line:84%
in the room, plants will
not release the pheromones.

00:19:15.390 --> 00:19:16.190 align:middle line:90%
>>BRADEN: Exactly.

00:19:16.190 --> 00:19:17.850 align:middle line:84%
>>LIPTON: So this
is intelligence way

00:19:17.850 --> 00:19:19.200 align:middle line:84%
beyond anything
we've ever conceived.

00:19:19.200 --> 00:19:20.000 align:middle line:90%
>>BRADEN: There is.

00:19:20.000 --> 00:19:22.170 align:middle line:10%
One of the places
where I saw that taken

00:19:22.170 --> 00:19:24.970 align:middle line:10%
to even another level,
and you may have visited,

00:19:24.970 --> 00:19:28.830 align:middle line:10%
Damanhur in Italy, the
intentional community.

00:19:28.830 --> 00:19:32.490 align:middle line:84%
They live close to the
earth, very earth-based,

00:19:32.490 --> 00:19:35.710 align:middle line:84%
really supporting this
primal relationship

00:19:35.710 --> 00:19:37.710 align:middle line:84%
that we have with the
earth and with all plants.

00:19:37.710 --> 00:19:39.990 align:middle line:84%
And the first visit that I had,
they invited me to come over,

00:19:39.990 --> 00:19:42.323 align:middle line:84%
and they wanted to share with
me some of the technology.

00:19:42.323 --> 00:19:48.030 align:middle line:84%
And they are developing some
pretty outrageous technology

00:19:48.030 --> 00:19:50.070 align:middle line:84%
compared to the way
we've been taught

00:19:50.070 --> 00:19:52.860 align:middle line:84%
to think about the world,
but it makes total sense

00:19:52.860 --> 00:19:54.810 align:middle line:84%
when we think about
this interconnection

00:19:54.810 --> 00:19:56.130 align:middle line:90%
that you're talking about.

00:19:56.130 --> 00:19:57.505 align:middle line:84%
One of of the
things I saw when I

00:19:57.505 --> 00:19:59.460 align:middle line:90%
went there was, I walked into--

00:19:59.460 --> 00:20:01.470 align:middle line:90%
it was in a tent, actually.

00:20:01.470 --> 00:20:03.240 align:middle line:84%
And they had a number
of different plants,

00:20:03.240 --> 00:20:06.210 align:middle line:84%
and they had machines
wired up to the plants.

00:20:06.210 --> 00:20:09.090 align:middle line:84%
And I'm a musician when I'm
not doing what I'm doing now.

00:20:09.090 --> 00:20:11.790 align:middle line:84%
And I always notice
audio equipment.

00:20:11.790 --> 00:20:14.070 align:middle line:84%
And the first thing I
saw, there were speakers.

00:20:14.070 --> 00:20:17.220 align:middle line:84%
And I thought, they're either
playing music to the plants,

00:20:17.220 --> 00:20:20.247 align:middle line:84%
or the plants are
saying something to us.

00:20:20.247 --> 00:20:21.330 align:middle line:90%
Because I was at Damanhur.

00:20:21.330 --> 00:20:24.090 align:middle line:84%
And so I said, can you tell
me what's happening here?

00:20:24.090 --> 00:20:28.200 align:middle line:84%
They had electrodes hooked
up to different portions

00:20:28.200 --> 00:20:29.460 align:middle line:90%
of the plants.

00:20:29.460 --> 00:20:31.350 align:middle line:84%
And what they found
was, when they

00:20:31.350 --> 00:20:34.800 align:middle line:84%
would touch the plants in very
specific ways, same thing.

00:20:34.800 --> 00:20:38.500 align:middle line:84%
The plants would emit
a frequency, inaudible.

00:20:38.500 --> 00:20:41.500 align:middle line:84%
And the devices
capture that frequency

00:20:41.500 --> 00:20:44.893 align:middle line:84%
and bumped it up to a level
that the human ear could hear.

00:20:44.893 --> 00:20:47.560 align:middle line:84%
And it literally-- Bruce, I have
to tell you, it was a symphony.

00:20:47.560 --> 00:20:50.690 align:middle line:84%
It was so beautiful, we
didn't want to leave.

00:20:50.690 --> 00:20:52.750 align:middle line:84%
And there were
multiple plants who

00:20:52.750 --> 00:20:54.665 align:middle line:84%
were emitting these
beautiful-- it

00:20:54.665 --> 00:20:57.350 align:middle line:90%
was symphony at the same time.

00:20:57.350 --> 00:20:59.720 align:middle line:84%
And when you begin to think
about plants in that way,

00:20:59.720 --> 00:21:02.530 align:middle line:84%
and if you do an experiment, if
you take a leaf off of a plant,

00:21:02.530 --> 00:21:04.973 align:middle line:84%
they let you know that that's
a trauma for them, because--

00:21:04.973 --> 00:21:06.640 align:middle line:84%
>>LIPTON: Don't say
that to vegetarians.

00:21:06.640 --> 00:21:09.640 align:middle line:84%
They're going to be very
upset about eating plants.

00:21:09.640 --> 00:21:11.350 align:middle line:84%
>>BRADEN: Because the
frequency changes.

00:21:11.350 --> 00:21:15.150 align:middle line:84%
All of this, these are all
discoveries in different ways

00:21:15.150 --> 00:21:17.470 align:middle line:84%
that go to this very
fundamental idea

00:21:17.470 --> 00:21:19.805 align:middle line:84%
that we are so deeply
connected to this world.

00:21:19.805 --> 00:21:21.430 align:middle line:84%
>>LIPTON: They found
out the same thing

00:21:21.430 --> 00:21:25.330 align:middle line:84%
with the crickets in the
field make vibrational sounds,

00:21:25.330 --> 00:21:26.680 align:middle line:90%
with the cricket sounds.

00:21:26.680 --> 00:21:29.890 align:middle line:84%
And then what they found is that
when the crickets disappeared,

00:21:29.890 --> 00:21:31.480 align:middle line:90%
the plants didn't do very well.

00:21:31.480 --> 00:21:34.193 align:middle line:84%
So the experiment was in
a field with no crickets,

00:21:34.193 --> 00:21:35.860 align:middle line:84%
and then a field where
they put speakers

00:21:35.860 --> 00:21:37.660 align:middle line:90%
in and played the crickets.

00:21:37.660 --> 00:21:40.022 align:middle line:84%
And the difference in
growth was profound.

00:21:40.022 --> 00:21:41.980 align:middle line:84%
The ones with the crickets,
the plants grew up.

00:21:41.980 --> 00:21:45.573 align:middle line:84%
There's a harmony in the
world, and quantum physics

00:21:45.573 --> 00:21:46.990 align:middle line:84%
is the thing that
says all of this

00:21:46.990 --> 00:21:48.670 align:middle line:84%
is connected, because
it says it's not

00:21:48.670 --> 00:21:51.550 align:middle line:84%
the physical expression that's
important in quantum physics.

00:21:51.550 --> 00:21:52.810 align:middle line:90%
It's the energy.

00:21:52.810 --> 00:21:55.660 align:middle line:84%
And that all energy, you
can't separate energy.

00:21:55.660 --> 00:21:57.100 align:middle line:90%
I can separate physical things.

00:21:57.100 --> 00:21:59.017 align:middle line:84%
I could take these two
hands and separate them

00:21:59.017 --> 00:22:01.720 align:middle line:84%
into two different hands,
but the energy of the hands

00:22:01.720 --> 00:22:03.430 align:middle line:90%
can never be separated.

00:22:03.430 --> 00:22:05.410 align:middle line:90%
Energy is in the field.

00:22:05.410 --> 00:22:07.240 align:middle line:84%
It's ripples, and
they all connect.

00:22:07.240 --> 00:22:10.390 align:middle line:84%
And this is why quantum
physics talks about unity

00:22:10.390 --> 00:22:11.680 align:middle line:90%
of the entire planet.

00:22:11.680 --> 00:22:13.957 align:middle line:84%
Everything is connected
to everything,

00:22:13.957 --> 00:22:15.790 align:middle line:84%
because everything is
energy, and everything

00:22:15.790 --> 00:22:17.630 align:middle line:90%
is vibration and waves.

00:22:17.630 --> 00:22:21.855 align:middle line:84%
And this is what we have lost
when we believe in a Newtonian

00:22:21.855 --> 00:22:24.230 align:middle line:84%
world, that I'm separate from
you, and you're over there,

00:22:24.230 --> 00:22:25.230 align:middle line:90%
and we're not connected.

00:22:25.230 --> 00:22:26.770 align:middle line:84%
And it's like, in
a quantum physics

00:22:26.770 --> 00:22:28.295 align:middle line:90%
world, that's completely wrong.

00:22:28.295 --> 00:22:29.170 align:middle line:90%
>>BRADEN: Absolutely.

00:22:29.170 --> 00:22:31.510 align:middle line:84%
And I think this is one
of the themes, again, that

00:22:31.510 --> 00:22:35.040 align:middle line:84%
is being reflected back through
these very powerful films.

00:22:35.040 --> 00:22:36.660 align:middle line:90%
I mean, I see these films.

00:22:36.660 --> 00:22:38.650 align:middle line:84%
Where did "The Matrix"
even come from?

00:22:38.650 --> 00:22:40.585 align:middle line:84%
I mean, the idea for
"The Matrix," yeah,

00:22:40.585 --> 00:22:42.730 align:middle line:84%
it came from the brothers
that developed it,

00:22:42.730 --> 00:22:46.090 align:middle line:84%
but where in the field did their
consciousness even pick this

00:22:46.090 --> 00:22:46.890 align:middle line:90%
up?

00:22:46.890 --> 00:22:48.580 align:middle line:90%
It was consciousness.

00:22:48.580 --> 00:22:52.180 align:middle line:84%
Were we calling forth,
asking for that film

00:22:52.180 --> 00:22:54.650 align:middle line:84%
to be made to remind us of
something about ourselves?

00:22:54.650 --> 00:22:56.483 align:middle line:84%
And one of the themes
is precisely what

00:22:56.483 --> 00:22:57.400 align:middle line:90%
we were talking about.

00:22:57.400 --> 00:23:00.800 align:middle line:84%
Because in addition to
"Avatar," for example,

00:23:00.800 --> 00:23:04.780 align:middle line:84%
being a very earth-based
and very much

00:23:04.780 --> 00:23:09.580 align:middle line:84%
about the connectivity of all
life, the theme of conflict

00:23:09.580 --> 00:23:11.490 align:middle line:84%
comes up in every
one of these films.

00:23:11.490 --> 00:23:14.410 align:middle line:84%
Somewhere there is
some kind of conflict.

00:23:14.410 --> 00:23:20.260 align:middle line:84%
And the key in each of the
films is that within each of us

00:23:20.260 --> 00:23:24.650 align:middle line:84%
we have this untapped
potential not just to survive,

00:23:24.650 --> 00:23:29.260 align:middle line:84%
but to transcend, to become
more than what that conflict has

00:23:29.260 --> 00:23:30.985 align:middle line:90%
led us to embrace in the past.

00:23:30.985 --> 00:23:32.360 align:middle line:84%
And when I think
of that, I mean,

00:23:32.360 --> 00:23:34.460 align:middle line:84%
it almost brings
tears to my eyes,

00:23:34.460 --> 00:23:36.760 align:middle line:84%
because that's where
we are right now.

00:23:36.760 --> 00:23:40.540 align:middle line:84%
The idea of war as we've
known it in the past I believe

00:23:40.540 --> 00:23:42.430 align:middle line:90%
has become obsolete.

00:23:42.430 --> 00:23:46.060 align:middle line:84%
In the old 20th
century, the idea of war

00:23:46.060 --> 00:23:48.550 align:middle line:84%
was that there were
winners and losers,

00:23:48.550 --> 00:23:51.580 align:middle line:84%
and that there was something to
be gained from this conflict.

00:23:51.580 --> 00:23:54.220 align:middle line:84%
And now we know, with the
technology that we have,

00:23:54.220 --> 00:23:56.890 align:middle line:84%
the weapons we have
today, the chemicals

00:23:56.890 --> 00:23:59.320 align:middle line:84%
we have today, war,
everybody loses.

00:23:59.320 --> 00:24:00.660 align:middle line:90%
There's nothing to be gained.

00:24:00.660 --> 00:24:03.490 align:middle line:10%
So I believe, and I want to
see where you are on this,

00:24:03.490 --> 00:24:06.460 align:middle line:10%
I believe that we are
the generation that

00:24:06.460 --> 00:24:12.100 align:middle line:10%
is coming to the understanding
where war is becoming obsolete.

00:24:12.100 --> 00:24:16.050 align:middle line:84%
War as we've known it in the
past has become obsolete.

00:24:16.050 --> 00:24:19.360 align:middle line:84%
And that by embracing
this inner potential

00:24:19.360 --> 00:24:22.578 align:middle line:84%
to transcend the conflict,
that is the evolutionary leap

00:24:22.578 --> 00:24:23.870 align:middle line:90%
that's going to take us beyond.

00:24:23.870 --> 00:24:25.985 align:middle line:84%
And that's what all
those films are showing.

00:24:25.985 --> 00:24:27.610 align:middle line:84%
That's what all the
movies are showing.

00:24:27.610 --> 00:24:28.720 align:middle line:90%
>>LIPTON: Absolutely.

00:24:28.720 --> 00:24:31.790 align:middle line:84%
And where do people
get these ideas?

00:24:31.790 --> 00:24:32.590 align:middle line:90%
It's intuition.

00:24:32.590 --> 00:24:34.190 align:middle line:90%
It comes from out of the body.

00:24:34.190 --> 00:24:34.990 align:middle line:90%
It's downloaded.

00:24:34.990 --> 00:24:37.690 align:middle line:84%
It's interesting, because
scientists and artists

00:24:37.690 --> 00:24:40.000 align:middle line:84%
do their work in another
realm, and then bring it back

00:24:40.000 --> 00:24:41.360 align:middle line:90%
into this realm.

00:24:41.360 --> 00:24:43.345 align:middle line:84%
And so there are truths
that are fundamental.

00:24:43.345 --> 00:24:45.220 align:middle line:84%
And if you go out there
and you pull them in,

00:24:45.220 --> 00:24:47.410 align:middle line:84%
that's why there are no
new stories, so to speak,

00:24:47.410 --> 00:24:49.788 align:middle line:84%
because they all are based
on the same kind of truth.

00:24:49.788 --> 00:24:51.830 align:middle line:84%
Just how you tell it might
be a little different,

00:24:51.830 --> 00:24:53.290 align:middle line:90%
but they're all the same story.

00:24:53.290 --> 00:24:53.390 align:middle line:90%
>>BRADEN: Yeah.

00:24:53.390 --> 00:24:55.098 align:middle line:84%
>>LIPTON: And we're
facing that, and it's

00:24:55.098 --> 00:24:59.110 align:middle line:84%
important to recognize that,
yes, the idea of conflict,

00:24:59.110 --> 00:25:03.160 align:middle line:84%
an old belief system supported
by a Darwinian theory that

00:25:03.160 --> 00:25:05.770 align:middle line:84%
says, that's the
only way out, is

00:25:05.770 --> 00:25:07.510 align:middle line:84%
a failure, because
Darwinian theory is

00:25:07.510 --> 00:25:09.580 align:middle line:84%
a failure in that
regard, that we're

00:25:09.580 --> 00:25:11.290 align:middle line:84%
coming together
in a new community

00:25:11.290 --> 00:25:12.370 align:middle line:90%
and new understanding.

00:25:12.370 --> 00:25:15.340 align:middle line:84%
The internet is
actually the creation

00:25:15.340 --> 00:25:17.230 align:middle line:84%
of a global nervous
system that can

00:25:17.230 --> 00:25:20.950 align:middle line:84%
hook eight billion human
cells together into one body.

00:25:20.950 --> 00:25:22.690 align:middle line:84%
Once that internet
was created, it

00:25:22.690 --> 00:25:26.100 align:middle line:84%
changed everybody's perspective,
because you don't see borders

00:25:26.100 --> 00:25:27.790 align:middle line:90%
in the internet.

00:25:27.790 --> 00:25:30.160 align:middle line:84%
And those people,
the Arab Spring

00:25:30.160 --> 00:25:31.990 align:middle line:84%
resulted because they
were looking at--

00:25:31.990 --> 00:25:32.110 align:middle line:90%
>>BRADEN: Twitter.

00:25:32.110 --> 00:25:33.860 align:middle line:84%
>>LIPTON: --What was
going on in the West,

00:25:33.860 --> 00:25:36.190 align:middle line:84%
and looking at their own
place going, why is this?

00:25:36.190 --> 00:25:38.650 align:middle line:84%
Once we all got
connected-- and I

00:25:38.650 --> 00:25:42.220 align:middle line:84%
would like to add a part about
the younger generation, which

00:25:42.220 --> 00:25:45.458 align:middle line:84%
I would collectively say,
from millennials on down,

00:25:45.458 --> 00:25:47.500 align:middle line:84%
they've always looked at
life as, oh my god, it's

00:25:47.500 --> 00:25:48.300 align:middle line:90%
so much trouble.

00:25:48.300 --> 00:25:51.760 align:middle line:84%
We owe all this money, can't
pay off the education debt,

00:25:51.760 --> 00:25:54.430 align:middle line:84%
can't get a job, three or
four trying to live together

00:25:54.430 --> 00:25:57.140 align:middle line:84%
in the same apartment,
and there's this very doom

00:25:57.140 --> 00:25:58.880 align:middle line:90%
and gloom kind of thing.

00:25:58.880 --> 00:26:01.510 align:middle line:84%
And I just want to
acknowledge to them, no,

00:26:01.510 --> 00:26:03.280 align:middle line:84%
that they play the
most important part

00:26:03.280 --> 00:26:05.260 align:middle line:84%
in this evolution
for a simple reason--

00:26:05.260 --> 00:26:07.330 align:middle line:84%
not being connected
to the structure

00:26:07.330 --> 00:26:11.170 align:middle line:84%
allows them to generate a
structure different than.

00:26:11.170 --> 00:26:15.280 align:middle line:84%
And so really, the drive
force of this evolution

00:26:15.280 --> 00:26:18.560 align:middle line:84%
will be the younger
generation, because they

00:26:18.560 --> 00:26:21.100 align:middle line:84%
have been separated from the
structure in the first place.

00:26:21.100 --> 00:26:24.700 align:middle line:84%
And they're much more
than 50% of the population

00:26:24.700 --> 00:26:25.940 align:middle line:90%
around the world.

00:26:25.940 --> 00:26:28.122 align:middle line:84%
And they're all connected
via the internet.

00:26:28.122 --> 00:26:30.580 align:middle line:84%
So this is really, when you
look at it, it's like, oh yeah,

00:26:30.580 --> 00:26:32.830 align:middle line:84%
this is moving
into this direction

00:26:32.830 --> 00:26:34.420 align:middle line:90%
of a new civilization.

00:26:34.420 --> 00:26:37.720 align:middle line:84%
And thank god we're still
here, because elders,

00:26:37.720 --> 00:26:38.960 align:middle line:90%
we're not thrown out.

00:26:38.960 --> 00:26:41.720 align:middle line:84%
We have advice and things
that we have learned.

00:26:41.720 --> 00:26:46.150 align:middle line:84%
So thank you for
bringing in a science

00:26:46.150 --> 00:26:48.700 align:middle line:84%
that we can pass on
to the millennials,

00:26:48.700 --> 00:26:50.825 align:middle line:84%
that they can use to create
the world that we need.

00:26:50.825 --> 00:26:52.492 align:middle line:84%
>>BRADEN: When did
we become the elders?

00:26:52.492 --> 00:26:53.450 align:middle line:90%
When did that happen?

00:26:53.450 --> 00:26:54.430 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:26:54.430 --> 00:26:56.250 align:middle line:84%
I remember the first
time, the first time

00:26:56.250 --> 00:26:58.000 align:middle line:84%
somebody in the audience
raised their hand

00:26:58.000 --> 00:26:59.420 align:middle line:90%
and said "Mr. Braden."

00:26:59.420 --> 00:27:00.650 align:middle line:90%
And I thought "Gregg?

00:27:00.650 --> 00:27:02.250 align:middle line:90%
You mean Gregg?"

00:27:02.250 --> 00:27:03.730 align:middle line:90%
It's really interesting.

00:27:03.730 --> 00:27:06.185 align:middle line:84%
we are considered elders
now, and I'm not sure

00:27:06.185 --> 00:27:07.310 align:middle line:90%
exactly when that happened.

00:27:07.310 --> 00:27:09.820 align:middle line:84%
But I want just about
a half a step back.

00:27:09.820 --> 00:27:12.160 align:middle line:84%
Something you said
was so important.

00:27:12.160 --> 00:27:14.820 align:middle line:84%
I had the privilege
a few years ago

00:27:14.820 --> 00:27:18.550 align:middle line:84%
of doing a number of
conferences with a man who

00:27:18.550 --> 00:27:21.740 align:middle line:84%
I have tremendous respect
for, I admire, Michio Kaku.

00:27:21.740 --> 00:27:22.540 align:middle line:90%
>>LIPTON: Oh, yes.

00:27:22.540 --> 00:27:23.230 align:middle line:90%
>>BRADEN: The physicist.

00:27:23.230 --> 00:27:23.920 align:middle line:90%
>>LIPTON: Yes.

00:27:23.920 --> 00:27:26.295 align:middle line:10%
>>BRADEN: And one of the most
powerful things that Michio

00:27:26.295 --> 00:27:29.068 align:middle line:10%
Kaku SAID and he said
it to an entire audience

00:27:29.068 --> 00:27:30.985 align:middle line:10%
one day, we were talking
about-- someone asked

00:27:30.985 --> 00:27:34.840 align:middle line:10%
a question about science
and the heart and intuition

00:27:34.840 --> 00:27:37.470 align:middle line:10%
and where scientists
separate that.

00:27:37.470 --> 00:27:39.000 align:middle line:90%
And his answer was so beautiful.

00:27:39.000 --> 00:27:41.793 align:middle line:84%
He said, if you
talk to a scientist

00:27:41.793 --> 00:27:43.210 align:middle line:84%
and they're really
honest, they're

00:27:43.210 --> 00:27:46.690 align:middle line:84%
really truthful with
you about their process,

00:27:46.690 --> 00:27:51.100 align:middle line:84%
9 out of 10 of the ideas
that a scientist will

00:27:51.100 --> 00:27:54.130 align:middle line:84%
explore and develop into a
theory begins with intuition.

00:27:54.130 --> 00:27:58.000 align:middle line:84%
They have an intuitive hit
that some relationship exists,

00:27:58.000 --> 00:28:00.917 align:middle line:90%
that some mechanism is at work.

00:28:00.917 --> 00:28:01.750 align:middle line:90%
But they don't know.

00:28:01.750 --> 00:28:04.540 align:middle line:84%
It's just they feel that,
but they're not trained.

00:28:04.540 --> 00:28:06.820 align:middle line:84%
Their training tells
them not to follow

00:28:06.820 --> 00:28:10.840 align:middle line:84%
the feeling but to develop
the science to prove it.

00:28:10.840 --> 00:28:13.258 align:middle line:84%
But it begins with
an intuitive hit.

00:28:13.258 --> 00:28:15.550 align:middle line:84%
And a lot of scientists don't
want to acknowledge that,

00:28:15.550 --> 00:28:18.220 align:middle line:84%
but he said 9 out of 10, that
that's where it comes from.

00:28:18.220 --> 00:28:20.950 align:middle line:84%
And that was so powerful,
because it's true.

00:28:20.950 --> 00:28:23.450 align:middle line:90%
I think we have a sense.

00:28:23.450 --> 00:28:24.250 align:middle line:90%
I'm a scientist.

00:28:24.250 --> 00:28:27.420 align:middle line:84%
I've worked with scientists
and engineers all my life.

00:28:27.420 --> 00:28:29.930 align:middle line:84%
And the corporations
mostly, more corporations

00:28:29.930 --> 00:28:31.062 align:middle line:90%
than universities.

00:28:31.062 --> 00:28:32.770 align:middle line:84%
And I would see this
happen all the time.

00:28:32.770 --> 00:28:35.650 align:middle line:84%
They'd say, well, what
if this were happening?

00:28:35.650 --> 00:28:39.130 align:middle line:84%
And then they would begin
the scientific methodology

00:28:39.130 --> 00:28:42.170 align:middle line:84%
to explore whether or not
this intuitive hit was,

00:28:42.170 --> 00:28:43.510 align:middle line:90%
in fact, what was happening.

00:28:43.510 --> 00:28:44.050 align:middle line:90%
So.

00:28:44.050 --> 00:28:45.550 align:middle line:84%
>>LIPTON: Well as you
said, I wish more of them

00:28:45.550 --> 00:28:46.967 align:middle line:84%
would acknowledge
it, because they

00:28:46.967 --> 00:28:48.610 align:middle line:84%
would give more
credence to the reality

00:28:48.610 --> 00:28:50.830 align:middle line:84%
that there's lots of answers
available if we can just

00:28:50.830 --> 00:28:53.980 align:middle line:84%
let go of the image we
hold and start to generate

00:28:53.980 --> 00:28:57.348 align:middle line:84%
some ideas from the field around
us and bring them back down,

00:28:57.348 --> 00:28:58.390 align:middle line:90%
bring them down to earth.

00:28:58.390 --> 00:29:01.000 align:middle line:84%
Because that's where all the
information is right now.

00:29:01.000 --> 00:29:03.250 align:middle line:84%
>>BRADEN: I think one in the
most powerful discoveries

00:29:03.250 --> 00:29:06.250 align:middle line:84%
that I've found-- and
it's gone from theory.

00:29:06.250 --> 00:29:09.550 align:middle line:84%
It's now actually being
engineered in Silicon Valley--

00:29:09.550 --> 00:29:15.100 align:middle line:84%
is the understanding
that information,

00:29:15.100 --> 00:29:17.730 align:middle line:84%
what we call memories of our
lives and the information

00:29:17.730 --> 00:29:20.340 align:middle line:84%
that we use, it
doesn't actually reside

00:29:20.340 --> 00:29:22.050 align:middle line:90%
within our neurons of our body.

00:29:22.050 --> 00:29:22.850 align:middle line:90%
>>LIPTON: Well.

00:29:22.850 --> 00:29:24.907 align:middle line:84%
>>BRADEN: That the
information is in the field.

00:29:24.907 --> 00:29:26.490 align:middle line:84%
And this is where
it gets interesting.

00:29:26.490 --> 00:29:28.530 align:middle line:84%
Because we're taught to think
that the field's over there

00:29:28.530 --> 00:29:29.490 align:middle line:90%
and we're here.

00:29:29.490 --> 00:29:30.340 align:middle line:90%
We are the field.

00:29:30.340 --> 00:29:34.620 align:middle line:84%
We are essentially wrinkles
in a field of space and time.

00:29:34.620 --> 00:29:38.160 align:middle line:84%
And every atom of our
bodies is constantly

00:29:38.160 --> 00:29:41.220 align:middle line:84%
emerging from the
substrate of this field.

00:29:41.220 --> 00:29:43.810 align:middle line:84%
We are constantly
renewing ourselves.

00:29:43.810 --> 00:29:45.958 align:middle line:10%
But what that means
is the neurons--

00:29:45.958 --> 00:29:47.500 align:middle line:10%
and that's why
scientists can't find.

00:29:47.500 --> 00:29:49.110 align:middle line:10%
They say, where?

00:29:49.110 --> 00:29:50.088 align:middle line:90%
Reductionism.

00:29:50.088 --> 00:29:51.630 align:middle line:84%
They go through,
they dissect these--

00:29:51.630 --> 00:29:53.970 align:middle line:84%
where is the information
being stored in the neurons?

00:29:53.970 --> 00:29:54.870 align:middle line:90%
It's not.

00:29:54.870 --> 00:29:56.430 align:middle line:84%
What they're finding
is, the neurons

00:29:56.430 --> 00:29:59.310 align:middle line:90%
are essentially soft antenna.

00:29:59.310 --> 00:30:04.200 align:middle line:84%
They are biological antenna that
tune to the place in the field

00:30:04.200 --> 00:30:05.457 align:middle line:90%
where this information lives.

00:30:05.457 --> 00:30:07.290 align:middle line:84%
And that's such a
different way of thinking,

00:30:07.290 --> 00:30:09.373 align:middle line:84%
but there are actually
chips in Silicon Valley now

00:30:09.373 --> 00:30:11.165 align:middle line:84%
that are being built
based on this concept.

00:30:11.165 --> 00:30:13.415 align:middle line:84%
>>LIPTON: This is exactly
what changed my whole career

00:30:13.415 --> 00:30:15.030 align:middle line:84%
in studying the
nature of epigenetics.

00:30:15.030 --> 00:30:18.140 align:middle line:84%
Because I started recognizing it
wasn't controlled by the genes.

00:30:18.140 --> 00:30:20.310 align:middle line:84%
Then I had to go, well,
where is it controlled by?

00:30:20.310 --> 00:30:22.480 align:middle line:84%
And I recognized as
a cell biologist,

00:30:22.480 --> 00:30:24.390 align:middle line:84%
the cell membrane is
the only structure

00:30:24.390 --> 00:30:29.190 align:middle line:84%
common to every living cell
or organism on the planet.

00:30:29.190 --> 00:30:31.380 align:middle line:84%
And everyone thought the
cell membrane was just

00:30:31.380 --> 00:30:34.205 align:middle line:84%
like a plastic wrap to
hold the cytoplasm in.

00:30:34.205 --> 00:30:35.580 align:middle line:84%
But when I started
to look at it,

00:30:35.580 --> 00:30:38.000 align:middle line:84%
I start to recognize,
oh my goodness.

00:30:38.000 --> 00:30:40.440 align:middle line:84%
I wrote a definition of
the cell membrane back

00:30:40.440 --> 00:30:42.875 align:middle line:90%
one night in 1985.

00:30:42.875 --> 00:30:44.250 align:middle line:84%
I'd been working
on the membrane,

00:30:44.250 --> 00:30:46.967 align:middle line:90%
because my research was in 1967.

00:30:46.967 --> 00:30:49.050 align:middle line:84%
>>BRADEN: I love having
this conversation with you

00:30:49.050 --> 00:30:50.160 align:middle line:90%
and when all this began.

00:30:50.160 --> 00:30:50.960 align:middle line:90%
So?

00:30:50.960 --> 00:30:53.760 align:middle line:84%
>>LIPTON: So 1985, I'm
trying to figure out, OK, I

00:30:53.760 --> 00:30:55.590 align:middle line:84%
know the environment
is controlling genes,

00:30:55.590 --> 00:30:57.780 align:middle line:84%
and it has to cross through
the membrane to do it.

00:30:57.780 --> 00:30:59.550 align:middle line:84%
And I wrote a
definition of the cell

00:30:59.550 --> 00:31:02.640 align:middle line:84%
membrane in a different way
than I've ever done it before.

00:31:02.640 --> 00:31:04.260 align:middle line:84%
And I wrote down,
"the cell membrane

00:31:04.260 --> 00:31:09.000 align:middle line:84%
is a crystal semiconductor
with gates and channels."

00:31:09.000 --> 00:31:10.890 align:middle line:84%
And at that moment,
it's like, wow, I've

00:31:10.890 --> 00:31:12.570 align:middle line:90%
heard that someplace before.

00:31:12.570 --> 00:31:14.190 align:middle line:84%
And i just bought
my first Macintosh

00:31:14.190 --> 00:31:16.260 align:middle line:84%
and a book, RadioShack,
"Understanding

00:31:16.260 --> 00:31:17.250 align:middle line:90%
Your Microprocessor."

00:31:17.250 --> 00:31:18.583 align:middle line:90%
I opened it up, and there it is.

00:31:18.583 --> 00:31:21.325 align:middle line:84%
It's like "a chip is a
crystal semiconductor

00:31:21.325 --> 00:31:22.200 align:middle line:90%
with gates channels."

00:31:22.200 --> 00:31:23.780 align:middle line:90%
I go, wow, what a coincidence!

00:31:23.780 --> 00:31:25.530 align:middle line:84%
>>BRADEN: That's not
what you really said.

00:31:25.530 --> 00:31:26.640 align:middle line:84%
>>LIPTON: No, I
said other things

00:31:26.640 --> 00:31:28.098 align:middle line:84%
I can't do on
television right now.

00:31:28.098 --> 00:31:31.050 align:middle line:84%
But the simple reality
was, it turns out

00:31:31.050 --> 00:31:32.340 align:middle line:90%
this is in fact what it is.

00:31:32.340 --> 00:31:34.860 align:middle line:84%
The membrane is an
information processor.

00:31:34.860 --> 00:31:36.870 align:middle line:84%
It reads the
environmental information,

00:31:36.870 --> 00:31:39.360 align:middle line:84%
processes it, turns it
into biological behavior,

00:31:39.360 --> 00:31:40.830 align:middle line:90%
and controls the genes.

00:31:40.830 --> 00:31:42.000 align:middle line:90%
That's epigenetics.

00:31:42.000 --> 00:31:44.820 align:middle line:84%
The environmental information
is controlling genes.

00:31:44.820 --> 00:31:47.190 align:middle line:84%
But at that moment, I
also realized something

00:31:47.190 --> 00:31:48.360 align:middle line:90%
so profoundly important.

00:31:48.360 --> 00:31:51.780 align:middle line:84%
And that is, first of
all, the information

00:31:51.780 --> 00:31:53.790 align:middle line:90%
is coming from outside.

00:31:53.790 --> 00:31:57.000 align:middle line:84%
And the information is
picked up by vibration.

00:31:57.000 --> 00:31:59.272 align:middle line:84%
And it conforms to
Albert Einstein's quote.

00:31:59.272 --> 00:32:01.230 align:middle line:84%
The most important one
that I use in my lecture

00:32:01.230 --> 00:32:06.090 align:middle line:84%
is, "the field is the sole
governing agency of matter."

00:32:06.090 --> 00:32:08.880 align:middle line:84%
And all of a sudden it
says that invisible stuff

00:32:08.880 --> 00:32:11.520 align:middle line:84%
is more important than
the physical stuff

00:32:11.520 --> 00:32:15.600 align:middle line:84%
that we see as physical stuff,
because it shapes the world.

00:32:15.600 --> 00:32:19.350 align:middle line:84%
And then for a guy
who wasn't spiritual,

00:32:19.350 --> 00:32:21.450 align:middle line:84%
at one point I "recognized
what separates you

00:32:21.450 --> 00:32:23.190 align:middle line:90%
and me from being not the same?

00:32:23.190 --> 00:32:25.380 align:middle line:84%
And I said, I can't put
my cells in your body

00:32:25.380 --> 00:32:27.360 align:middle line:84%
because your immune system
will say "not self."

00:32:27.360 --> 00:32:29.820 align:middle line:84%
You can't put your cells
in anybody else's body.

00:32:29.820 --> 00:32:31.170 align:middle line:90%
Their immune system "not self."

00:32:31.170 --> 00:32:33.378 align:middle line:84%
And the question is then,
where the heck is the self?

00:32:33.378 --> 00:32:35.850 align:middle line:84%
And that moment, my
whole life changed,

00:32:35.850 --> 00:32:38.790 align:middle line:84%
because I recognized what is
different between you and I?

00:32:38.790 --> 00:32:41.370 align:middle line:84%
Our liver cells are the
same, but on your cells

00:32:41.370 --> 00:32:44.650 align:middle line:84%
you have a set of what
are called self-receptors.

00:32:44.650 --> 00:32:46.322 align:middle line:84%
Now, medicine studies
a small group.

00:32:46.322 --> 00:32:47.280 align:middle line:90%
They're a bigger group.

00:32:47.280 --> 00:32:49.197 align:middle line:84%
These are antennas on
the surface of the cell.

00:32:49.197 --> 00:32:50.320 align:middle line:90%
They receive a signal.

00:32:50.320 --> 00:32:51.420 align:middle line:90%
And guess what?

00:32:51.420 --> 00:32:55.170 align:middle line:84%
Our identity is picked
up from the environment

00:32:55.170 --> 00:32:57.060 align:middle line:90%
by self-receptors.

00:32:57.060 --> 00:32:58.560 align:middle line:90%
Well, that brings in two things.

00:32:58.560 --> 00:33:01.650 align:middle line:84%
A, our identity that makes
us different from each other

00:33:01.650 --> 00:33:02.850 align:middle line:90%
is not physical.

00:33:02.850 --> 00:33:04.110 align:middle line:90%
It's a broadcast.

00:33:04.110 --> 00:33:05.060 align:middle line:90%
It's a vibration.

00:33:05.060 --> 00:33:05.580 align:middle line:90%
>>BRADEN: It's not in here.

00:33:05.580 --> 00:33:07.020 align:middle line:90%
>>LIPTON: Ah, it's not inside.

00:33:07.020 --> 00:33:08.550 align:middle line:90%
It's coming from outside.

00:33:08.550 --> 00:33:12.090 align:middle line:84%
And more importantly,
you can't die.

00:33:12.090 --> 00:33:14.360 align:middle line:84%
You're not even
in here, you know?

00:33:14.360 --> 00:33:18.210 align:middle line:84%
And basically, we
are energy fields

00:33:18.210 --> 00:33:21.510 align:middle line:84%
playing through a
virtual reality system.

00:33:21.510 --> 00:33:23.895 align:middle line:84%
And just so it doesn't
confuse too many people,

00:33:23.895 --> 00:33:25.645 align:middle line:84%
because in my own
scientific mind, I said,

00:33:25.645 --> 00:33:27.490 align:middle line:90%
oh my god, I'm not even in here.

00:33:27.490 --> 00:33:29.580 align:middle line:84%
Which the means
that you can't die,

00:33:29.580 --> 00:33:33.120 align:middle line:84%
because it's like a television
set recording of a show.

00:33:33.120 --> 00:33:35.220 align:middle line:84%
You can watch a TV,
and the show is going.

00:33:35.220 --> 00:33:36.060 align:middle line:90%
TV breaks.

00:33:36.060 --> 00:33:39.367 align:middle line:84%
Oh, TV'S dead, but the
broadcast is still there.

00:33:39.367 --> 00:33:40.950 align:middle line:84%
Same thing with the
cells in our body.

00:33:40.950 --> 00:33:43.620 align:middle line:84%
Our cells are
receiving an identity

00:33:43.620 --> 00:33:46.200 align:middle line:84%
through these antennas
that's from the field.

00:33:46.200 --> 00:33:48.690 align:middle line:84%
Point is, the cells could
die, but the broadcast

00:33:48.690 --> 00:33:50.320 align:middle line:90%
is still there.

00:33:50.320 --> 00:33:52.890 align:middle line:84%
And once I started to realize
that, oh my gosh, you know?

00:33:52.890 --> 00:33:56.310 align:middle line:84%
This whole
understanding about how

00:33:56.310 --> 00:33:57.700 align:middle line:90%
we have a spiritual entity--

00:33:57.700 --> 00:33:59.700 align:middle line:84%
I don't want to say
"spiritual" for some people,

00:33:59.700 --> 00:34:01.310 align:middle line:90%
because that's religious.

00:34:01.310 --> 00:34:03.810 align:middle line:84%
It's not religious
to me, "spiritual."

00:34:03.810 --> 00:34:04.860 align:middle line:90%
I'll use physics.

00:34:04.860 --> 00:34:06.130 align:middle line:90%
Same word, "field."

00:34:06.130 --> 00:34:06.930 align:middle line:90%
Why?

00:34:06.930 --> 00:34:08.940 align:middle line:84%
"Field," invisible
moving forces that

00:34:08.940 --> 00:34:10.290 align:middle line:90%
influence the physical world.

00:34:10.290 --> 00:34:12.630 align:middle line:84%
"Spirit," invisible
moving forces that

00:34:12.630 --> 00:34:14.270 align:middle line:90%
influence the physical world.

00:34:14.270 --> 00:34:15.270 align:middle line:90%
You want to say "field"?

00:34:15.270 --> 00:34:15.960 align:middle line:90%
You want to say "spirit"?

00:34:15.960 --> 00:34:16.710 align:middle line:90%
I don't care which one.

00:34:16.710 --> 00:34:17.610 align:middle line:90%
Field's more science.

00:34:17.610 --> 00:34:18.960 align:middle line:90%
Spirit, whatever.

00:34:18.960 --> 00:34:20.139 align:middle line:90%
What's the point?

00:34:20.139 --> 00:34:22.230 align:middle line:90%
And the point was simply this--

00:34:22.230 --> 00:34:24.820 align:middle line:84%
as a scientist, I said,
well, wait a minute.

00:34:24.820 --> 00:34:29.610 align:middle line:84%
If I have a spirit, and
that's the immortal broadcast,

00:34:29.610 --> 00:34:32.070 align:middle line:90%
then why do I have a body?

00:34:32.070 --> 00:34:34.320 align:middle line:84%
And that's when I found
out I had very funny cells.

00:34:34.320 --> 00:34:37.830 align:middle line:84%
Because I asked a question,
why I have a spirit in a body?

00:34:37.830 --> 00:34:39.147 align:middle line:90%
Why not just be a spirit?

00:34:39.147 --> 00:34:40.980 align:middle line:84%
And the body gave me
an answer, which I just

00:34:40.980 --> 00:34:42.813 align:middle line:84%
really want to say,
because it blew my mind.

00:34:42.813 --> 00:34:44.840 align:middle line:84%
And the answer was, I
said, "why have both?"

00:34:44.840 --> 00:34:47.010 align:middle line:84%
And the cells answered
with a question.

00:34:47.010 --> 00:34:49.290 align:middle line:84%
They said, "Bruce, if
you're just a spirit,

00:34:49.290 --> 00:34:51.760 align:middle line:90%
what does chocolate taste like?"

00:34:51.760 --> 00:34:54.270 align:middle line:84%
And if you stop and
realize, you say, oh my god.

00:34:54.270 --> 00:34:56.460 align:middle line:84%
This is a virtual
reality machine.

00:34:56.460 --> 00:34:59.160 align:middle line:84%
We come in here, and we can
taste, and smell, and see,

00:34:59.160 --> 00:35:00.745 align:middle line:90%
and feel love and all that.

00:35:00.745 --> 00:35:03.120 align:middle line:84%
And all of a sudden, that
changed my whole meaning of why

00:35:03.120 --> 00:35:04.620 align:middle line:90%
we're here on this planet.

00:35:04.620 --> 00:35:06.420 align:middle line:90%
We came here to create.

00:35:06.420 --> 00:35:08.535 align:middle line:84%
And the idea is, I look
around, and go, well,

00:35:08.535 --> 00:35:10.410 align:middle line:84%
we're not doing a great
job at this creation.

00:35:10.410 --> 00:35:12.900 align:middle line:84%
But then I realized this,
we've also been programmed.

00:35:12.900 --> 00:35:15.750 align:middle line:84%
The movie "The Matrix," as we
talked about, is a documentary.

00:35:15.750 --> 00:35:16.945 align:middle line:90%
Everybody's programmed.

00:35:16.945 --> 00:35:18.570 align:middle line:84%
And if we get out of
the program, which

00:35:18.570 --> 00:35:21.300 align:middle line:84%
is the work that you talk about
and the work that I talk about,

00:35:21.300 --> 00:35:23.883 align:middle line:84%
if you get out of the program,
then you become a free creator.

00:35:23.883 --> 00:35:25.467 align:middle line:84%
If you're in the
program, you're going

00:35:25.467 --> 00:35:26.910 align:middle line:84%
to create whatever
the program is.

00:35:26.910 --> 00:35:29.340 align:middle line:90%
And we have been misprogrammed.

00:35:29.340 --> 00:35:32.490 align:middle line:84%
And that has caused the
problem on this planet.

00:35:32.490 --> 00:35:34.920 align:middle line:84%
And to get out is to
listen to the science

00:35:34.920 --> 00:35:37.350 align:middle line:84%
that you talk about, the
science that I talk about

00:35:37.350 --> 00:35:40.500 align:middle line:84%
and say, it's our choice
to change consciousness.

00:35:40.500 --> 00:35:43.980 align:middle line:84%
Because that, even according
to quantum physics,

00:35:43.980 --> 00:35:45.550 align:middle line:84%
is what's creating
this whole thing.

00:35:45.550 --> 00:35:46.060 align:middle line:90%
>>BRADEN: Sure.

00:35:46.060 --> 00:35:47.393 align:middle line:90%
Well, it's a very different way.

00:35:47.393 --> 00:35:49.620 align:middle line:84%
What we're talking about,
it's based on science.

00:35:49.620 --> 00:35:52.560 align:middle line:84%
It's a very different
way for people to think.

00:35:52.560 --> 00:35:54.150 align:middle line:90%
I'm a systems thinker.

00:35:54.150 --> 00:35:58.668 align:middle line:84%
So I like to be in the
nanosecond of right now.

00:35:58.668 --> 00:36:00.460 align:middle line:84%
But I also like to look
at the big picture.

00:36:00.460 --> 00:36:02.377 align:middle line:84%
And these are the kinds
of discoveries, Bruce.

00:36:02.377 --> 00:36:05.280 align:middle line:84%
I cannot help but think
that these are the kinds

00:36:05.280 --> 00:36:10.420 align:middle line:84%
of discoveries that expand our
understanding of who we are

00:36:10.420 --> 00:36:13.330 align:middle line:84%
and how we relate to one
another that will break down

00:36:13.330 --> 00:36:17.320 align:middle line:84%
the barriers that have separated
us precisely at the time when

00:36:17.320 --> 00:36:19.600 align:middle line:90%
the world is being pushed.

00:36:19.600 --> 00:36:24.730 align:middle line:84%
We're being mushed together
as cultures, and religions,

00:36:24.730 --> 00:36:25.928 align:middle line:90%
and the ways that we think.

00:36:25.928 --> 00:36:27.970 align:middle line:84%
The way that men are taught
to think about women,

00:36:27.970 --> 00:36:29.140 align:middle line:90%
that women think about men.

00:36:29.140 --> 00:36:30.057 align:middle line:90%
>>LIPTON: Programming.

00:36:30.057 --> 00:36:32.370 align:middle line:84%
>>BRADEN: Yeah, all of
that, for the first time,

00:36:32.370 --> 00:36:35.870 align:middle line:84%
we are globalizing almost eight
billion people on the planet.

00:36:35.870 --> 00:36:37.900 align:middle line:84%
And we're trying to
accommodate the change

00:36:37.900 --> 00:36:40.720 align:middle line:84%
through a thinking based
in the false assumptions

00:36:40.720 --> 00:36:43.300 align:middle line:84%
of an obsolete science of
separation, competition,

00:36:43.300 --> 00:36:44.100 align:middle line:90%
conflict.

00:36:44.100 --> 00:36:45.350 align:middle line:90%
And it's not working.

00:36:45.350 --> 00:36:48.070 align:middle line:84%
So these are the discoveries
that give us the reason

00:36:48.070 --> 00:36:48.980 align:middle line:90%
to think differently.

00:36:48.980 --> 00:36:52.510 align:middle line:84%
And I think they are the
kinds of discoveries that--

00:36:52.510 --> 00:36:53.420 align:middle line:90%
two things.

00:36:53.420 --> 00:36:57.010 align:middle line:84%
They are going to
lead us to a deeper

00:36:57.010 --> 00:36:58.207 align:middle line:90%
understanding of ourselves.

00:36:58.207 --> 00:37:00.040 align:middle line:84%
The better we know
ourselves, the less we're

00:37:00.040 --> 00:37:01.623 align:middle line:84%
going to fear the
change in the world,

00:37:01.623 --> 00:37:05.560 align:middle line:84%
the less we fear other people
and ultimately our own power.

00:37:05.560 --> 00:37:06.730 align:middle line:90%
But the second thing--

00:37:06.730 --> 00:37:10.760 align:middle line:84%
and you and I have had
this conversation before--

00:37:10.760 --> 00:37:14.550 align:middle line:84%
in the 1990s, I met a
Native American man here.

00:37:14.550 --> 00:37:16.550 align:middle line:84%
We're in the high desert
of northern New Mexico,

00:37:16.550 --> 00:37:18.740 align:middle line:84%
and it wasn't far from
here where I met this man.

00:37:18.740 --> 00:37:21.460 align:middle line:84%
Never seen him
before in my life.

00:37:21.460 --> 00:37:23.220 align:middle line:84%
We were hiking through
the high desert

00:37:23.220 --> 00:37:26.490 align:middle line:84%
of an archaeological
site called Chaco Canyon.

00:37:26.490 --> 00:37:30.190 align:middle line:90%
And we just hit it off.

00:37:30.190 --> 00:37:32.590 align:middle line:90%
I was with my mom at the time.

00:37:32.590 --> 00:37:37.630 align:middle line:84%
And him seeing a grown man with
his mother in a sacred site

00:37:37.630 --> 00:37:40.930 align:middle line:84%
and the respect to an
elder was the doorway

00:37:40.930 --> 00:37:43.480 align:middle line:84%
that made him feel very
comfortable in communicating

00:37:43.480 --> 00:37:44.500 align:middle line:90%
with me.

00:37:44.500 --> 00:37:48.010 align:middle line:84%
And he told me a
story, and my mom.

00:37:48.010 --> 00:37:52.375 align:middle line:84%
And the story was essentially
that a long time ago, people

00:37:52.375 --> 00:37:54.250 align:middle line:84%
on the earth lived very
differently than they

00:37:54.250 --> 00:37:56.590 align:middle line:84%
do right now, and they were
deeply connected to themselves

00:37:56.590 --> 00:37:57.390 align:middle line:90%
and one another.

00:37:57.390 --> 00:37:58.530 align:middle line:90%
Something happened.

00:37:58.530 --> 00:37:59.890 align:middle line:90%
And they don't know what.

00:37:59.890 --> 00:38:01.420 align:middle line:90%
People got lost.

00:38:01.420 --> 00:38:03.015 align:middle line:84%
And they so longed
for the connection

00:38:03.015 --> 00:38:04.390 align:middle line:84%
that they used to
have-- and this

00:38:04.390 --> 00:38:05.770 align:middle line:90%
is where it gets interesting.

00:38:05.770 --> 00:38:08.410 align:middle line:84%
He said that people so
longed for that connection

00:38:08.410 --> 00:38:13.050 align:middle line:84%
they began to build in the
world outside of their bodies

00:38:13.050 --> 00:38:16.860 align:middle line:84%
the machines that mimic the
function that we already

00:38:16.860 --> 00:38:17.670 align:middle line:90%
have within.

00:38:17.670 --> 00:38:19.780 align:middle line:84%
And he said we live
in that world now.

00:38:19.780 --> 00:38:23.310 align:middle line:84%
And the world will become
more and more and more complex

00:38:23.310 --> 00:38:25.860 align:middle line:84%
until we recognize that
everything we built out there,

00:38:25.860 --> 00:38:29.760 align:middle line:84%
in one way or another, it mimics
what we already are in here.

00:38:29.760 --> 00:38:31.740 align:middle line:84%
And the day that
that happens, we

00:38:31.740 --> 00:38:34.350 align:middle line:84%
no longer need the complexity
of that outer world

00:38:34.350 --> 00:38:38.850 align:middle line:84%
because we are now
more sophisticated,

00:38:38.850 --> 00:38:42.390 align:middle line:84%
but simplified as we embrace
our own inner technology.

00:38:42.390 --> 00:38:43.780 align:middle line:90%
And I thought, wow.

00:38:43.780 --> 00:38:44.580 align:middle line:90%
What?

00:38:44.580 --> 00:38:46.950 align:middle line:84%
And that's what all
these stories are about.

00:38:46.950 --> 00:38:50.130 align:middle line:84%
"The Matrix," they're all
about human potential,

00:38:50.130 --> 00:38:53.790 align:middle line:84%
that we are wired to thrive
in these times of extremes.

00:38:53.790 --> 00:38:55.710 align:middle line:84%
And we have this
untapped potential,

00:38:55.710 --> 00:38:58.260 align:middle line:84%
because every cell
in our body does--

00:38:58.260 --> 00:38:59.720 align:middle line:90%
I work in a high tech industry.

00:38:59.720 --> 00:39:02.790 align:middle line:84%
I worked in Star Wars,
SDI, during the Cold War,

00:39:02.790 --> 00:39:06.070 align:middle line:84%
laser systems, complex
information systems.

00:39:06.070 --> 00:39:08.820 align:middle line:84%
I've never seen anything
built, Bruce, outside of us

00:39:08.820 --> 00:39:12.840 align:middle line:84%
that does not mimic what we
already are in ourselves.

00:39:12.840 --> 00:39:16.230 align:middle line:84%
And we've got 50 trillion
plus of these cells.

00:39:16.230 --> 00:39:19.380 align:middle line:84%
As we learn to
master and harmonize

00:39:19.380 --> 00:39:22.285 align:middle line:84%
this inner technology, we don't
need all this stuff out here.

00:39:22.285 --> 00:39:23.160 align:middle line:90%
>>LIPTON: Absolutely.

00:39:23.160 --> 00:39:25.620 align:middle line:84%
And in fact, the leading
edge of biological research

00:39:25.620 --> 00:39:26.940 align:middle line:90%
is called "biomimicry."

00:39:26.940 --> 00:39:28.680 align:middle line:84%
It says that if you
want to do it right,

00:39:28.680 --> 00:39:30.430 align:middle line:84%
then you have to see
how the body does it,

00:39:30.430 --> 00:39:33.990 align:middle line:84%
because it's had several billion
years of making it right.

00:39:33.990 --> 00:39:36.690 align:middle line:84%
And so the technologies
that are in the body

00:39:36.690 --> 00:39:39.650 align:middle line:84%
exceed the technologies
that humans create.

00:39:39.650 --> 00:39:40.920 align:middle line:90%
>>BRADEN: Absolutely.

00:39:40.920 --> 00:39:42.337 align:middle line:84%
>>LIPTON: And as
a cell biologist,

00:39:42.337 --> 00:39:44.790 align:middle line:84%
I get a lot of joy out of it,
because people have always

00:39:44.790 --> 00:39:46.350 align:middle line:84%
believed, well,
humans are smart,

00:39:46.350 --> 00:39:49.000 align:middle line:84%
and every time you go down
to the next lower animal,

00:39:49.000 --> 00:39:50.880 align:middle line:84%
there's less intelligence,
less intelligence,

00:39:50.880 --> 00:39:52.420 align:middle line:84%
and then you get
down to the cell.

00:39:52.420 --> 00:39:54.795 align:middle line:84%
And you say, well, how much
intelligence can a cell have?

00:39:54.795 --> 00:39:57.660 align:middle line:84%
And then I turn around
and go, they created us.

00:39:57.660 --> 00:40:00.030 align:middle line:84%
They created us with
technology that we can't even

00:40:00.030 --> 00:40:01.650 align:middle line:90%
duplicate at this moment.

00:40:01.650 --> 00:40:05.350 align:middle line:84%
And this is why they're all
saying, the answers lie within.

00:40:05.350 --> 00:40:06.690 align:middle line:90%
And I totally believe it.

00:40:06.690 --> 00:40:09.270 align:middle line:84%
Inside here, 50
trillion cells learning

00:40:09.270 --> 00:40:12.600 align:middle line:84%
to live in harmony in a healthy
human body, there's a politics.

00:40:12.600 --> 00:40:13.670 align:middle line:90%
There's an economy.

00:40:13.670 --> 00:40:15.640 align:middle line:90%
There is a social structure.

00:40:15.640 --> 00:40:17.730 align:middle line:84%
And I said, what
we need to learn

00:40:17.730 --> 00:40:20.245 align:middle line:84%
is how do 50 trillion cells
live in harmony like that?

00:40:20.245 --> 00:40:21.120 align:middle line:90%
>>BRADEN: Absolutely.

00:40:21.120 --> 00:40:22.330 align:middle line:90%
I think this is the key.

00:40:22.330 --> 00:40:25.757 align:middle line:84%
And that's where I want to
close with this segment is,

00:40:25.757 --> 00:40:27.590 align:middle line:84%
people are asking-- all
this is interesting.

00:40:27.590 --> 00:40:29.130 align:middle line:84%
People in their
mind, I know they're

00:40:29.130 --> 00:40:30.250 align:middle line:90%
saying same thing I say.

00:40:30.250 --> 00:40:31.590 align:middle line:84%
What do we do with
all this information?

00:40:31.590 --> 00:40:33.660 align:middle line:84%
Where do we go with this,
and in a world that's

00:40:33.660 --> 00:40:36.240 align:middle line:84%
changing faster than we can
document in our textbooks

00:40:36.240 --> 00:40:37.480 align:middle line:90%
and teach in our classrooms?

00:40:37.480 --> 00:40:40.790 align:middle line:84%
And I think you have
nailed the answer--

00:40:40.790 --> 00:40:42.480 align:middle line:90%
nature is the model.

00:40:42.480 --> 00:40:45.520 align:middle line:84%
And that model is playing
out through the cells

00:40:45.520 --> 00:40:46.320 align:middle line:90%
in our bodies.

00:40:46.320 --> 00:40:49.890 align:middle line:84%
And if we ever
forget, or we doubt

00:40:49.890 --> 00:40:53.640 align:middle line:84%
about the accuracy
of cooperation

00:40:53.640 --> 00:40:56.880 align:middle line:84%
and how deeply it's
embedded into the world,

00:40:56.880 --> 00:40:59.280 align:middle line:84%
we need look no further
than the 50 trillion cells

00:40:59.280 --> 00:41:02.470 align:middle line:84%
we have in our bodies to see
that cooperation playing out.

00:41:02.470 --> 00:41:05.670 align:middle line:84%
So the key, what we
shared with the UN,

00:41:05.670 --> 00:41:07.440 align:middle line:90%
what we share in our teachings?

00:41:07.440 --> 00:41:08.580 align:middle line:90%
Look to nature.

00:41:08.580 --> 00:41:12.760 align:middle line:84%
Look to life for the model, and
apply that to our solutions.

00:41:12.760 --> 00:41:14.850 align:middle line:84%
And I think if we do
that, we can't go wrong.

00:41:14.850 --> 00:41:16.558 align:middle line:84%
>>LIPTON: I agree with
you, and I thank--

00:41:16.558 --> 00:41:17.683 align:middle line:90%
>>BRADEN: Dr. Bruce Lipton.

00:41:17.683 --> 00:41:19.730 align:middle line:84%
Thank you for sharing this
time together tonight.

00:41:19.730 --> 00:41:20.938 align:middle line:90%
I appreciate it tremendously.

00:41:20.938 --> 00:41:22.617 align:middle line:90%
>>LIPTON: Thank you very much.

00:41:22.617 --> 00:41:24.200 align:middle line:84%
>>BRADEN: I'm your
host, Gregg Braden.

00:41:24.200 --> 00:41:25.617 align:middle line:84%
I'm gonna invite
you to stay tuned

00:41:25.617 --> 00:41:28.860 align:middle line:84%
for another all-new episode
of "Missing Links," where

00:41:28.860 --> 00:41:32.310 align:middle line:84%
Bruce Lipton and I are going to
talk about where we go with all

00:41:32.310 --> 00:41:34.920 align:middle line:84%
this information and how
we apply it in our lives,

00:41:34.920 --> 00:41:37.835 align:middle line:84%
in the world that's changing
faster than we can document it

00:41:37.835 --> 00:41:41.210 align:middle line:84%
in our textbooks and teach
it in our classrooms.

00:41:41.210 --> 00:41:52.171 align:middle line:90%
