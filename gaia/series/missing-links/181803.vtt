00:00:24.620 --> 00:00:26.630 align:middle line:84%
>>GREGG BRADEN: Hello,
my name is Gregg Braden.

00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:29.030 align:middle line:10%
I'd like to welcome you to
this all-new presentation

00:00:29.030 --> 00:00:32.689 align:middle line:10%
of "The Divine Matrix"
bridging time, space, miracles,

00:00:32.689 --> 00:00:34.010 align:middle line:10%
and belief.

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:36.000 align:middle line:84%
In the last episode
of this program,

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:40.760 align:middle line:84%
we saw how a 3,000-year-old
map of time holds the key

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:43.490 align:middle line:84%
to what's possible in the
world as well as our lives.

00:00:43.490 --> 00:00:46.970 align:middle line:84%
In this episode, we'll cross
the traditional boundaries

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:49.790 align:middle line:84%
that separate the physics
and biology in the past

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:53.300 align:middle line:84%
to reveal the superhuman
potential of what is now being

00:00:53.300 --> 00:00:56.480 align:middle line:84%
recognized as an
internal technology

00:00:56.480 --> 00:00:59.450 align:middle line:84%
and how we can use our
inner technology to bypass,

00:00:59.450 --> 00:01:02.780 align:middle line:84%
to hack the limits of what we
believe was possible for us

00:01:02.780 --> 00:01:04.426 align:middle line:90%
in the past.

00:01:04.426 --> 00:01:09.080 align:middle line:84%
A new school of thought suggests
that consciousness informs

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:13.650 align:middle line:84%
itself through its creation,
through its art, music, books,

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:15.140 align:middle line:90%
and movies.

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:17.030 align:middle line:84%
With this idea in
mind, when we look

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:19.820 align:middle line:84%
at the themes of some of
the most popular movies

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:22.070 align:middle line:84%
of our time, what
are those movies

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:23.630 align:middle line:90%
telling us about ourselves?

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:27.140 align:middle line:84%
If consciousness is
informing us of something

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:30.560 align:middle line:84%
that we need to know about
ourselves through the things

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:33.920 align:middle line:84%
that we create to remind
ourselves of ourselves,

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:36.050 align:middle line:90%
what are those films telling us?

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:39.140 align:middle line:10%
Well, examples include
the hugely popular movies

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:41.300 align:middle line:10%
like "The Matrix," for
example, or "Avatar,"

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:43.550 align:middle line:10%
or the movie "Inception."

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:45.740 align:middle line:84%
What are films like
these saying to us?

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:49.400 align:middle line:84%
What part of our reality
are they reminding us of?

00:01:49.400 --> 00:01:52.400 align:middle line:84%
Well, if we look at the common
themes, they'll give us a clue.

00:01:52.400 --> 00:01:54.560 align:middle line:84%
As different as they
are from one another,

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:57.340 align:middle line:84%
each of these movies is
suggesting, number one,

00:01:57.340 --> 00:02:01.460 align:middle line:84%
that there is a world that
exists we simply cannot see

00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:03.740 align:middle line:90%
from our limited perspective.

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:07.250 align:middle line:84%
But this world influences
our everyday lives.

00:02:07.250 --> 00:02:11.870 align:middle line:84%
Number two, we're told that
we're limited in our lives

00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:15.140 align:middle line:84%
only until we wake
up to the parameters

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:16.910 align:middle line:90%
of this unseen world.

00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:20.900 align:middle line:84%
Number three, they're telling
us that everyone has the ability

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:24.140 align:middle line:84%
to do just that, to
wake up and to transcend

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:27.200 align:middle line:84%
the limits of their
lives that begin

00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:29.870 align:middle line:84%
with the events in the world
that we can't even see.

00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:34.070 align:middle line:10%
The success of a recent movie--
the 2017 movie "Arrival--"

00:02:34.070 --> 00:02:37.190 align:middle line:10%
is another beautiful
example of what I mean here.

00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:39.710 align:middle line:10%
And it opens the door
to precisely what I want

00:02:39.710 --> 00:02:41.840 align:middle line:10%
to talk about in this episode.

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:45.280 align:middle line:10%
The theme of the
"Arrival" is so powerful,

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:47.750 align:middle line:10%
it may be one of the most
powerful, underrated,

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:51.560 align:middle line:10%
and perhaps hopeful messages
seen in modern times.

00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:55.700 align:middle line:84%
Because beyond the theme of
the ETs, and of the conflict,

00:02:55.700 --> 00:02:58.160 align:middle line:84%
and UFOs, and the
special effects,

00:02:58.160 --> 00:03:02.310 align:middle line:84%
what the movie is saying to
us is that there is a message.

00:03:02.310 --> 00:03:04.800 align:middle line:84%
And the message is
very, very simple.

00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:06.830 align:middle line:10%
The message says
that the language

00:03:06.830 --> 00:03:09.230 align:middle line:10%
that we use in
our everyday lives

00:03:09.230 --> 00:03:13.100 align:middle line:10%
determines the way our
brain connects the neurons

00:03:13.100 --> 00:03:15.800 align:middle line:10%
and in turn, the way
that we think and even

00:03:15.800 --> 00:03:17.770 align:middle line:10%
what we think about.

00:03:17.770 --> 00:03:20.600 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to let you think
about what I just said.

00:03:20.600 --> 00:03:24.050 align:middle line:84%
This movie is suggesting
somehow that the words

00:03:24.050 --> 00:03:28.420 align:middle line:84%
that we use to communicate
day in and day out--

00:03:28.420 --> 00:03:32.720 align:middle line:84%
they are more than simply
words, that they actually

00:03:32.720 --> 00:03:36.570 align:middle line:84%
are directly linked to
the neurons in our brain.

00:03:36.570 --> 00:03:40.340 align:middle line:84%
Now, if you've ever thought
about the power of just being

00:03:40.340 --> 00:03:44.330 align:middle line:84%
able to speak, I'd
like to share with you

00:03:44.330 --> 00:03:48.020 align:middle line:84%
just how potent that
ability is unto itself.

00:03:48.020 --> 00:03:52.370 align:middle line:84%
And that will lead us into the
power of the language itself.

00:03:52.370 --> 00:03:56.480 align:middle line:84%
When we speak, when we say
the words to convey what

00:03:56.480 --> 00:04:00.310 align:middle line:84%
it is that we're thinking
and feeling in our lives,

00:04:00.310 --> 00:04:02.520 align:middle line:84%
what we're really
doing is a series

00:04:02.520 --> 00:04:05.990 align:middle line:84%
of steps that begins with
one of the most intimate acts

00:04:05.990 --> 00:04:07.630 align:middle line:90%
that we could ever imagine.

00:04:07.630 --> 00:04:11.700 align:middle line:84%
We invite into the deepest
recesses of our bodies

00:04:11.700 --> 00:04:15.360 align:middle line:84%
the breath of life from the
world beyond our bodies.

00:04:15.360 --> 00:04:19.220 align:middle line:84%
We breathe in what is
called the sacred breath.

00:04:19.220 --> 00:04:21.500 align:middle line:84%
We breathe it into our
bodies, and we draw

00:04:21.500 --> 00:04:24.410 align:middle line:90%
it deep into our diaphragm.

00:04:24.410 --> 00:04:27.025 align:middle line:84%
And once that breath
is in the diaphragm,

00:04:27.025 --> 00:04:30.050 align:middle line:90%
we begin to massage that breath.

00:04:30.050 --> 00:04:31.610 align:middle line:10%
With our diaphragm,
with the muscles

00:04:31.610 --> 00:04:33.890 align:middle line:10%
in our diaphragm in
a very precise wave,

00:04:33.890 --> 00:04:37.460 align:middle line:10%
we flutter the diaphragm
just the right way

00:04:37.460 --> 00:04:40.430 align:middle line:10%
to now direct the air
back from where it just

00:04:40.430 --> 00:04:46.670 align:middle line:10%
came, back through the passages,
over the muscles in our throat

00:04:46.670 --> 00:04:51.500 align:middle line:10%
that vibrate and undulate in
just the right way at just

00:04:51.500 --> 00:04:54.740 align:middle line:10%
the right time to create
the acoustic vibrations that

00:04:54.740 --> 00:04:58.910 align:middle line:10%
allow what we were thinking
to be emitted from our body,

00:04:58.910 --> 00:05:02.330 align:middle line:10%
from our mouth, back
into the air around us

00:05:02.330 --> 00:05:06.080 align:middle line:10%
as messages that
become precisely that,

00:05:06.080 --> 00:05:08.150 align:middle line:10%
the messages that
are interpreted

00:05:08.150 --> 00:05:09.950 align:middle line:10%
through the eardrums
of the people

00:05:09.950 --> 00:05:11.360 align:middle line:10%
that we're speaking with.

00:05:11.360 --> 00:05:12.160 align:middle line:90%
Wow.

00:05:12.160 --> 00:05:14.840 align:middle line:84%
When you think about
that, what masters we are.

00:05:14.840 --> 00:05:17.405 align:middle line:84%
What masters we are
at the communication.

00:05:17.405 --> 00:05:21.080 align:middle line:84%
But what our ancestors
are telling us is that

00:05:21.080 --> 00:05:24.320 align:middle line:84%
the language that we
are using to convey

00:05:24.320 --> 00:05:27.110 align:middle line:90%
that sacred acoustic vibration--

00:05:27.110 --> 00:05:30.300 align:middle line:84%
that language is really
where the action is.

00:05:30.300 --> 00:05:32.990 align:middle line:84%
So the English language
as well as many others

00:05:32.990 --> 00:05:36.230 align:middle line:84%
is based upon principles
of separation.

00:05:36.230 --> 00:05:39.410 align:middle line:84%
And that separation is
reflected in the ideas

00:05:39.410 --> 00:05:42.020 align:middle line:84%
that it embraces,
separate and isolated

00:05:42.020 --> 00:05:47.630 align:middle line:84%
thinking about things like you
versus me or them versus us.

00:05:47.630 --> 00:05:50.370 align:middle line:84%
We think about
winners and losers.

00:05:50.370 --> 00:05:53.420 align:middle line:84%
This is the language
of conflict and war.

00:05:53.420 --> 00:05:56.060 align:middle line:84%
Language based in
connection creates

00:05:56.060 --> 00:05:58.910 align:middle line:84%
a very, very different
kind of experience,

00:05:58.910 --> 00:06:00.385 align:middle line:90%
different kind of thinking.

00:06:00.385 --> 00:06:04.160 align:middle line:84%
A language based in
connection is unity thinking.

00:06:04.160 --> 00:06:06.410 align:middle line:84%
This is the language of
evolution, of community,

00:06:06.410 --> 00:06:08.095 align:middle line:90%
of cooperation.

00:06:08.095 --> 00:06:11.120 align:middle line:84%
So the bottom line to what
I'm saying to you here

00:06:11.120 --> 00:06:12.530 align:middle line:90%
is that we changed the language.

00:06:12.530 --> 00:06:13.550 align:middle line:90%
We changed the brain.

00:06:13.550 --> 00:06:18.410 align:middle line:84%
Or stated another way, change
the language, change the way

00:06:18.410 --> 00:06:21.090 align:middle line:90%
the brain accesses the matrix.

00:06:21.090 --> 00:06:24.050 align:middle line:84%
Well, these ideas are central
to the theme of the "Arrival."

00:06:24.050 --> 00:06:26.750 align:middle line:90%
And here's what I mean.

00:06:26.750 --> 00:06:29.720 align:middle line:84%
A growing body of
scientific evidence

00:06:29.720 --> 00:06:34.160 align:middle line:84%
now suggests that we
do not hold memory

00:06:34.160 --> 00:06:36.650 align:middle line:90%
in the neurons in our bodies.

00:06:36.650 --> 00:06:40.394 align:middle line:84%
We now know we have neurons in
the heart as well as the brain.

00:06:40.394 --> 00:06:41.810 align:middle line:84%
What these discoveries
are showing

00:06:41.810 --> 00:06:46.880 align:middle line:84%
us is that those neurons are
not what contain the memory,

00:06:46.880 --> 00:06:53.780 align:middle line:84%
rather the neurons we can
think of as biological antenna,

00:06:53.780 --> 00:06:58.250 align:middle line:84%
soft antenna that tune to
the place in the field,

00:06:58.250 --> 00:07:02.960 align:middle line:84%
in the matrix where our
memories actually reside.

00:07:02.960 --> 00:07:05.940 align:middle line:84%
Now, this idea is more
than just a metaphor.

00:07:05.940 --> 00:07:07.820 align:middle line:90%
It's more than just a theory.

00:07:07.820 --> 00:07:09.950 align:middle line:84%
What I'm saying
to you is so real

00:07:09.950 --> 00:07:13.190 align:middle line:84%
that engineers are
actually now beginning

00:07:13.190 --> 00:07:17.510 align:middle line:84%
to design the next generation of
computer chips based precisely

00:07:17.510 --> 00:07:19.210 align:middle line:90%
by this idea.

00:07:19.210 --> 00:07:24.230 align:middle line:84%
When engineers were working
with futuristic technologies,

00:07:24.230 --> 00:07:26.540 align:middle line:84%
they were saying, where
is our computer technology

00:07:26.540 --> 00:07:28.410 align:middle line:90%
going to go?

00:07:28.410 --> 00:07:30.200 align:middle line:84%
One of the things
they discovered

00:07:30.200 --> 00:07:34.310 align:middle line:84%
is that the silica that
we've used in the past

00:07:34.310 --> 00:07:36.920 align:middle line:84%
has limitations for the
amount of information

00:07:36.920 --> 00:07:39.620 align:middle line:84%
that can be stored
on that silicon chip.

00:07:39.620 --> 00:07:42.170 align:middle line:90%
So they began looking to nature.

00:07:42.170 --> 00:07:45.770 align:middle line:84%
Where in nature can
we find the material

00:07:45.770 --> 00:07:48.320 align:middle line:84%
that could contain the
vast amounts of information

00:07:48.320 --> 00:07:50.420 align:middle line:84%
that we're now
beginning to access?

00:07:50.420 --> 00:07:52.250 align:middle line:90%
And they chose water.

00:07:52.250 --> 00:07:56.990 align:middle line:84%
The new chips are actually based
upon a single droplet of water.

00:07:56.990 --> 00:07:59.630 align:middle line:84%
Now, this isn't tap
water from the bathroom.

00:07:59.630 --> 00:08:03.950 align:middle line:84%
It's highly refined, highly
structured water compressed

00:08:03.950 --> 00:08:08.720 align:middle line:84%
into a chip that interfaces
with the machine,

00:08:08.720 --> 00:08:11.660 align:middle line:84%
with the computer
as we know it today.

00:08:11.660 --> 00:08:14.990 align:middle line:84%
When the researchers began
filling these chips with

00:08:14.990 --> 00:08:18.920 align:middle line:84%
information, what happened was
there was so much information

00:08:18.920 --> 00:08:22.490 align:middle line:84%
that was being stored, they said
this droplet of water cannot

00:08:22.490 --> 00:08:25.730 align:middle line:84%
possibly store that
amount of information.

00:08:25.730 --> 00:08:29.030 align:middle line:84%
They were pumping tremendous
amounts, libraries

00:08:29.030 --> 00:08:31.400 align:middle line:90%
of information into this chip.

00:08:31.400 --> 00:08:34.340 align:middle line:84%
And the mystery was, where's
the information being stored?

00:08:34.340 --> 00:08:37.370 align:middle line:84%
And they realized that the
information was not confined

00:08:37.370 --> 00:08:39.289 align:middle line:90%
to the droplet of water.

00:08:39.289 --> 00:08:43.760 align:middle line:84%
The information was being
held in a field that is linked

00:08:43.760 --> 00:08:44.840 align:middle line:90%
to that droplet of water.

00:08:44.840 --> 00:08:46.670 align:middle line:84%
The information
was actually being

00:08:46.670 --> 00:08:50.150 align:middle line:84%
held in a field that extended
beyond the machine itself.

00:08:50.150 --> 00:08:52.309 align:middle line:84%
I know this is a very
different way of thinking,

00:08:52.309 --> 00:08:53.350 align:middle line:90%
but this is how we learn.

00:08:53.350 --> 00:08:57.200 align:middle line:84%
This is how science arrives
at the new understandings that

00:08:57.200 --> 00:08:59.990 align:middle line:84%
lead us to deeper
understandings,

00:08:59.990 --> 00:09:02.970 align:middle line:84%
perhaps the deepest
truths of our existence.

00:09:02.970 --> 00:09:06.510 align:middle line:84%
So the information doesn't
live in our brains.

00:09:06.510 --> 00:09:07.760 align:middle line:90%
It doesn't live in our hearts.

00:09:07.760 --> 00:09:09.560 align:middle line:90%
It doesn't live in our cells.

00:09:09.560 --> 00:09:12.110 align:middle line:84%
The information is stored
in the world around us.

00:09:12.110 --> 00:09:15.590 align:middle line:84%
And because of that,
the way we access

00:09:15.590 --> 00:09:18.410 align:middle line:84%
that information plays a
very, very powerful role

00:09:18.410 --> 00:09:21.400 align:middle line:90%
in our lives.

00:09:21.400 --> 00:09:22.840 align:middle line:90%
So I'd like to share a story.

00:09:22.840 --> 00:09:27.580 align:middle line:84%
And this is a true story of
precisely what the information

00:09:27.580 --> 00:09:30.910 align:middle line:84%
I just shared with you
means in our lives.

00:09:30.910 --> 00:09:34.060 align:middle line:84%
I live in an artist community,
a very creative community

00:09:34.060 --> 00:09:36.130 align:middle line:90%
in northern New Mexico.

00:09:36.130 --> 00:09:37.420 align:middle line:90%
A lot of artists--

00:09:37.420 --> 00:09:41.270 align:middle line:84%
visual artists,
sculptors, musicians,

00:09:41.270 --> 00:09:43.602 align:middle line:84%
writers all come
together in the beauty

00:09:43.602 --> 00:09:45.310 align:middle line:84%
of the high desert of
northern New Mexico

00:09:45.310 --> 00:09:46.730 align:middle line:90%
to create what they create.

00:09:46.730 --> 00:09:47.980 align:middle line:90%
And it's always been that way.

00:09:47.980 --> 00:09:51.370 align:middle line:84%
Georgia O'Keeffe, for example,
Ansel Adams made their home.

00:09:51.370 --> 00:09:52.190 align:middle line:90%
DH Lawrence.

00:09:52.190 --> 00:09:54.356 align:middle line:84%
They all made their homes
in this part of the world,

00:09:54.356 --> 00:09:57.060 align:middle line:84%
because it supports
this creative spirit.

00:09:57.060 --> 00:09:59.230 align:middle line:84%
Well, one of the interesting
things that I've seen

00:09:59.230 --> 00:10:01.100 align:middle line:84%
in my community-- and
if you're an artist,

00:10:01.100 --> 00:10:03.010 align:middle line:84%
you may have experienced
this as well--

00:10:03.010 --> 00:10:04.780 align:middle line:84%
is that a lot of
times the artists

00:10:04.780 --> 00:10:06.450 align:middle line:84%
have a hard time
supporting themselves

00:10:06.450 --> 00:10:07.450 align:middle line:90%
through their creations.

00:10:07.450 --> 00:10:10.540 align:middle line:84%
So they end up with
other jobs to make

00:10:10.540 --> 00:10:14.110 align:middle line:84%
the income that allows them
to create the things that they

00:10:14.110 --> 00:10:15.130 align:middle line:90%
love.

00:10:15.130 --> 00:10:16.838 align:middle line:84%
And the story I'm
going to share with you

00:10:16.838 --> 00:10:19.720 align:middle line:84%
is a story of precisely
such an artist.

00:10:19.720 --> 00:10:21.490 align:middle line:84%
But it relates to
the way information

00:10:21.490 --> 00:10:24.970 align:middle line:84%
is stored in the field and
what it can mean to a creation.

00:10:24.970 --> 00:10:26.470 align:middle line:90%
So I had a dear friend of mine--

00:10:26.470 --> 00:10:29.230 align:middle line:84%
musician, keyboard
artist who had just

00:10:29.230 --> 00:10:30.940 align:middle line:84%
created one of
the most awesomely

00:10:30.940 --> 00:10:35.200 align:middle line:84%
beautiful, mystical, compelling,
intriguing pieces of music

00:10:35.200 --> 00:10:36.670 align:middle line:90%
that I had ever heard.

00:10:36.670 --> 00:10:40.300 align:middle line:84%
And I said, well, I can't wait
until that becomes available.

00:10:40.300 --> 00:10:45.220 align:middle line:84%
Well, to my musician friend,
it wasn't ready for the world.

00:10:45.220 --> 00:10:46.774 align:middle line:90%
He said, I like what I've done.

00:10:46.774 --> 00:10:48.940 align:middle line:84%
He said, but it's not quite
ready for the world yet.

00:10:48.940 --> 00:10:50.731 align:middle line:84%
He says, I'm going to
take it in the studio

00:10:50.731 --> 00:10:51.880 align:middle line:90%
and do some more work.

00:10:51.880 --> 00:10:53.680 align:middle line:90%
So he would go into the studio.

00:10:53.680 --> 00:10:56.590 align:middle line:84%
He'd spend all of his
money, honing and refining

00:10:56.590 --> 00:10:58.280 align:middle line:90%
this masterful piece of work.

00:10:58.280 --> 00:10:59.780 align:middle line:90%
Then he'd run out of money.

00:10:59.780 --> 00:11:02.530 align:middle line:84%
And then he would spend six
months working in a restaurant

00:11:02.530 --> 00:11:05.290 align:middle line:84%
or in a bar somewhere, saving
enough money to go back

00:11:05.290 --> 00:11:08.324 align:middle line:84%
into the studio, so he could
work, and refine, and hone this

00:11:08.324 --> 00:11:09.490 align:middle line:90%
again, and again, and again.

00:11:09.490 --> 00:11:11.720 align:middle line:90%
This went on for over a year.

00:11:11.720 --> 00:11:16.660 align:middle line:84%
So I had a speaking event
in the Los Angeles area.

00:11:16.660 --> 00:11:21.010 align:middle line:84%
My friend picked me up at the
Los Angeles Airport at LAX.

00:11:21.010 --> 00:11:23.980 align:middle line:84%
And we got into the car,
and I turned on the radio.

00:11:23.980 --> 00:11:27.370 align:middle line:84%
And when I turned on the
radio, my friend's music

00:11:27.370 --> 00:11:29.320 align:middle line:90%
was playing on the radio.

00:11:29.320 --> 00:11:32.560 align:middle line:84%
Not the words to the
song, but the music

00:11:32.560 --> 00:11:34.570 align:middle line:84%
that he had been working
on, that he'd been

00:11:34.570 --> 00:11:36.977 align:middle line:90%
honing and refining for months.

00:11:36.977 --> 00:11:37.810 align:middle line:90%
And he looked at me.

00:11:37.810 --> 00:11:40.280 align:middle line:90%
And he said that's my song.

00:11:40.280 --> 00:11:43.395 align:middle line:84%
And I said, well,
that was your song.

00:11:43.395 --> 00:11:46.690 align:middle line:84%
I said the universe tapped
you on the shoulder.

00:11:46.690 --> 00:11:50.020 align:middle line:84%
The universe directed
you with inspiration.

00:11:50.020 --> 00:11:53.470 align:middle line:84%
You were given the gift of this
song to share with the world.

00:11:53.470 --> 00:11:57.340 align:middle line:84%
And you felt that the
world wasn't quite ready

00:11:57.340 --> 00:12:00.610 align:middle line:84%
or maybe the music wasn't ready
to share with the world yet.

00:12:00.610 --> 00:12:05.410 align:middle line:84%
But once you anchored your
creation in the field,

00:12:05.410 --> 00:12:09.340 align:middle line:84%
it wasn't held in the cells
of your brain or your heart.

00:12:09.340 --> 00:12:11.450 align:middle line:90%
It's in the field around us.

00:12:11.450 --> 00:12:13.840 align:middle line:84%
And what that means--
it's available for anyone

00:12:13.840 --> 00:12:16.180 align:middle line:84%
who is tuned into that
place in the field.

00:12:16.180 --> 00:12:18.280 align:middle line:84%
There are other creative
people out there,

00:12:18.280 --> 00:12:22.300 align:middle line:84%
creative people who are
reaching deep within themselves

00:12:22.300 --> 00:12:27.280 align:middle line:84%
to create something new, to
create something, a new, higher

00:12:27.280 --> 00:12:29.410 align:middle line:90%
expression of whatever it is.

00:12:29.410 --> 00:12:33.040 align:middle line:84%
And it is their
desire to create.

00:12:33.040 --> 00:12:36.100 align:middle line:84%
It is them reaching
within themselves

00:12:36.100 --> 00:12:40.660 align:middle line:84%
to create that actually allows
them access to the field

00:12:40.660 --> 00:12:42.490 align:middle line:90%
where your music was living.

00:12:42.490 --> 00:12:44.950 align:middle line:84%
So you didn't share your
music with the universe,

00:12:44.950 --> 00:12:47.530 align:middle line:84%
but the universe made sure
that it was out there.

00:12:47.530 --> 00:12:50.920 align:middle line:84%
And this was a very, very
powerful lesson for my friend.

00:12:50.920 --> 00:12:53.710 align:middle line:84%
I've had the same experience
when it comes to book titles,

00:12:53.710 --> 00:12:54.910 align:middle line:90%
for example.

00:12:54.910 --> 00:12:57.160 align:middle line:84%
I've anchored very, very
good titles for the books.

00:12:57.160 --> 00:12:59.890 align:middle line:84%
And I said, I'm not ready
to write that book yet.

00:12:59.890 --> 00:13:01.930 align:middle line:84%
Two months, three months
later, somebody else--

00:13:01.930 --> 00:13:02.950 align:middle line:90%
I look on Amazon.

00:13:02.950 --> 00:13:05.590 align:middle line:84%
And there is that book
title-- that exact book title

00:13:05.590 --> 00:13:08.740 align:middle line:84%
and even the same subtitle that
I never shared with anyone.

00:13:08.740 --> 00:13:09.900 align:middle line:90%
How did that happen?

00:13:09.900 --> 00:13:10.810 align:middle line:90%
It's in the field.

00:13:10.810 --> 00:13:12.976 align:middle line:84%
And the reason I'm sharing
this with you right now--

00:13:12.976 --> 00:13:14.970 align:middle line:84%
and I'm going to speak
directly to you--

00:13:14.970 --> 00:13:18.370 align:middle line:84%
is because each of you
have a creative impulse.

00:13:18.370 --> 00:13:21.700 align:middle line:84%
And when the universe gives
you the gift of a creation,

00:13:21.700 --> 00:13:24.130 align:middle line:84%
and taps you on the
shoulder, and says

00:13:24.130 --> 00:13:28.180 align:middle line:84%
here is something to
share with the world,

00:13:28.180 --> 00:13:30.490 align:middle line:84%
that inspiration
means the world is

00:13:30.490 --> 00:13:32.920 align:middle line:84%
ready for your creation
in that moment.

00:13:32.920 --> 00:13:34.560 align:middle line:90%
And I'm going to invite you.

00:13:34.560 --> 00:13:37.060 align:middle line:84%
Please share your
gifts with the world,

00:13:37.060 --> 00:13:39.460 align:middle line:84%
because we need what
you're creating.

00:13:39.460 --> 00:13:42.910 align:middle line:84%
You never know how your creation
is going to influence or impact

00:13:42.910 --> 00:13:45.480 align:middle line:84%
someone in this world when
you share it with them.

00:13:45.480 --> 00:13:48.520 align:middle line:84%
But the fact that you
have that inspiration

00:13:48.520 --> 00:13:51.520 align:middle line:84%
tells me that the world
is ready for whatever

00:13:51.520 --> 00:13:52.810 align:middle line:90%
it is you've created.

00:13:52.810 --> 00:13:57.310 align:middle line:84%
So please, share your
creations with the world.

00:13:57.310 --> 00:13:59.890 align:middle line:84%
When we create, here's
what's happening

00:13:59.890 --> 00:14:01.120 align:middle line:90%
on a biological level.

00:14:01.120 --> 00:14:04.690 align:middle line:84%
And this is going to be a
direct segue into the power

00:14:04.690 --> 00:14:05.910 align:middle line:90%
of language in our lives.

00:14:05.910 --> 00:14:09.460 align:middle line:90%


00:14:09.460 --> 00:14:14.770 align:middle line:84%
The act of you
creating, the act of you

00:14:14.770 --> 00:14:19.660 align:middle line:84%
reaching deep inside
of your being,

00:14:19.660 --> 00:14:24.070 align:middle line:84%
reaching deep to bring something
new forward, the act of you

00:14:24.070 --> 00:14:27.250 align:middle line:84%
striving to create
and become something

00:14:27.250 --> 00:14:30.580 align:middle line:84%
more in the next minute than
you were one minute ago--

00:14:30.580 --> 00:14:35.020 align:middle line:84%
that act is the
biological trigger

00:14:35.020 --> 00:14:39.730 align:middle line:84%
that is the impetus
for your neurons

00:14:39.730 --> 00:14:44.410 align:middle line:84%
to begin to wire in a way
that will support what it is

00:14:44.410 --> 00:14:46.030 align:middle line:90%
that you've chosen to create.

00:14:46.030 --> 00:14:48.405 align:middle line:84%
So let me just give
you an example of this.

00:14:48.405 --> 00:14:49.205 align:middle line:90%
I'm a musician.

00:14:49.205 --> 00:14:50.650 align:middle line:90%
I'm a guitar player.

00:14:50.650 --> 00:14:53.350 align:middle line:10%
I have been all my life,
since I was eight years old,

00:14:53.350 --> 00:14:55.450 align:middle line:10%
is when I began.

00:14:55.450 --> 00:14:59.440 align:middle line:84%
When I want to learn how to
play like another guitar player,

00:14:59.440 --> 00:15:01.960 align:middle line:84%
one of the most influential
guitar players in my life

00:15:01.960 --> 00:15:04.030 align:middle line:90%
was a man named Michael Hedges.

00:15:04.030 --> 00:15:06.370 align:middle line:84%
Michael Hedges passed
a few years ago.

00:15:06.370 --> 00:15:08.530 align:middle line:90%
He was a Windham Hill artist.

00:15:08.530 --> 00:15:10.570 align:middle line:90%
And I saw him live.

00:15:10.570 --> 00:15:12.490 align:middle line:84%
I saw him play live,
and I went up the stage.

00:15:12.490 --> 00:15:14.320 align:middle line:84%
And he took the
time to talk to me.

00:15:14.320 --> 00:15:15.840 align:middle line:90%
He was very kind to me--

00:15:15.840 --> 00:15:19.060 align:middle line:84%
had a very, very powerful
impact on my life.

00:15:19.060 --> 00:15:20.920 align:middle line:84%
Michael Hedges--
when I saw him play,

00:15:20.920 --> 00:15:25.630 align:middle line:84%
he blew all of the constructs,
all the rules of the way

00:15:25.630 --> 00:15:28.120 align:middle line:84%
I've been taught classically
to play a guitar.

00:15:28.120 --> 00:15:29.930 align:middle line:84%
He blew those rules
right out of the water.

00:15:29.930 --> 00:15:31.840 align:middle line:84%
He gave me the
freedom of expression.

00:15:31.840 --> 00:15:32.881 align:middle line:90%
And I respect him.

00:15:32.881 --> 00:15:33.880 align:middle line:90%
And I loved him so much.

00:15:33.880 --> 00:15:36.790 align:middle line:84%
I was so sorry when
he left this world.

00:15:36.790 --> 00:15:39.310 align:middle line:84%
So when I want to play
like Michael Hedges

00:15:39.310 --> 00:15:41.330 align:middle line:84%
and I listen to his
songs again and again,

00:15:41.330 --> 00:15:44.459 align:middle line:84%
at first it's very mechanical,
but there is a point.

00:15:44.459 --> 00:15:46.000 align:middle line:84%
And maybe you've
had this experience.

00:15:46.000 --> 00:15:47.583 align:middle line:84%
If you're trying to
learn a language--

00:15:47.583 --> 00:15:49.240 align:middle line:84%
French, or Spanish,
or you're trying

00:15:49.240 --> 00:15:50.827 align:middle line:84%
to solve mathematic
problem, you're

00:15:50.827 --> 00:15:51.910 align:middle line:90%
going through the motions.

00:15:51.910 --> 00:15:54.565 align:middle line:84%
And all of a sudden,
one morning you wake up,

00:15:54.565 --> 00:15:55.690 align:middle line:90%
and you're speaking French.

00:15:55.690 --> 00:15:56.740 align:middle line:90%
You're speaking Spanish.

00:15:56.740 --> 00:15:59.592 align:middle line:84%
You're thinking the language
of the mathematicians.

00:15:59.592 --> 00:16:01.550 align:middle line:84%
You're thinking the
language of Michael Hedges.

00:16:01.550 --> 00:16:03.490 align:middle line:84%
And all of a sudden, you know
where those cord progressions

00:16:03.490 --> 00:16:04.290 align:middle line:90%
work.

00:16:04.290 --> 00:16:06.580 align:middle line:84%
When that happens,
here's what you've done.

00:16:06.580 --> 00:16:09.850 align:middle line:84%
What you've done is
the act of you striving

00:16:09.850 --> 00:16:14.710 align:middle line:84%
to achieve that expression,
is what triggers the neurons

00:16:14.710 --> 00:16:19.930 align:middle line:84%
in your body to actually find
other neurons to grow and find

00:16:19.930 --> 00:16:20.730 align:middle line:90%
other neurons.

00:16:20.730 --> 00:16:22.690 align:middle line:84%
The image you're seeing
on your screen right

00:16:22.690 --> 00:16:27.280 align:middle line:84%
now is a single isolated neuron
looking for another neuron

00:16:27.280 --> 00:16:28.637 align:middle line:90%
that it can hook up with.

00:16:28.637 --> 00:16:29.470 align:middle line:90%
They're very social.

00:16:29.470 --> 00:16:31.690 align:middle line:84%
They want to hook
up these neurons.

00:16:31.690 --> 00:16:33.550 align:middle line:84%
And what you're
seeing on your screen

00:16:33.550 --> 00:16:37.590 align:middle line:84%
is what happens to many neurons
when you are doing this.

00:16:37.590 --> 00:16:40.900 align:middle line:10%
It is the act of you
striving to create

00:16:40.900 --> 00:16:44.110 align:middle line:10%
that triggers the neurons
to fire the way they fire.

00:16:44.110 --> 00:16:48.370 align:middle line:10%
This has a direct impact
and a direct consequence

00:16:48.370 --> 00:16:50.290 align:middle line:10%
when it comes to
language in the words

00:16:50.290 --> 00:16:53.245 align:middle line:10%
that we use to express
ourselves in our lives.

00:16:53.245 --> 00:16:56.410 align:middle line:84%
So one of the first
scientific links

00:16:56.410 --> 00:16:58.660 align:middle line:84%
to what I'm talking
about here-- the link

00:16:58.660 --> 00:17:01.750 align:middle line:84%
between the language that
we use and our biology,

00:17:01.750 --> 00:17:03.520 align:middle line:84%
the way that our
neurons fire-- was

00:17:03.520 --> 00:17:06.040 align:middle line:84%
made early in the 20th
century by a linguist.

00:17:06.040 --> 00:17:08.349 align:middle line:90%
His name was Benjamin Lee Whorf.

00:17:08.349 --> 00:17:11.500 align:middle line:84%
And the ideas that
Benjamin Whorf

00:17:11.500 --> 00:17:13.750 align:middle line:84%
shared in the world
of linguistics,

00:17:13.750 --> 00:17:16.660 align:middle line:84%
in the world of science-- they
were radical for his time.

00:17:16.660 --> 00:17:17.890 align:middle line:90%
What he said is this.

00:17:17.890 --> 00:17:22.420 align:middle line:84%
Number one, he said that the
way that we speak actually

00:17:22.420 --> 00:17:25.683 align:middle line:84%
influences the
way that we think.

00:17:25.683 --> 00:17:27.099 align:middle line:84%
But perhaps even
more importantly,

00:17:27.099 --> 00:17:31.480 align:middle line:84%
number two, he said the way
that we speak influences

00:17:31.480 --> 00:17:34.570 align:middle line:84%
what we think, that
our thoughts, what

00:17:34.570 --> 00:17:39.160 align:middle line:84%
we are capable of thinking
are actually linked to the way

00:17:39.160 --> 00:17:42.070 align:middle line:90%
our neurons are being wired.

00:17:42.070 --> 00:17:45.694 align:middle line:10%
One of the reasons that
Whorf came to this conclusion

00:17:45.694 --> 00:17:47.110 align:middle line:10%
is because of the
work that he was

00:17:47.110 --> 00:17:49.570 align:middle line:10%
doing with an indigenous
people in North America,

00:17:49.570 --> 00:17:52.080 align:middle line:10%
northern Arizona, the Hopi.

00:17:52.080 --> 00:17:55.300 align:middle line:84%
What he found was that
the language of the Hopi--

00:17:55.300 --> 00:17:57.310 align:middle line:84%
when that language
was translated

00:17:57.310 --> 00:17:59.770 align:middle line:84%
into English, what he
found is that the Hopi

00:17:59.770 --> 00:18:02.440 align:middle line:84%
have a very, very
different way of thinking

00:18:02.440 --> 00:18:07.540 align:middle line:84%
about us, about nature, about
our relationship to the world

00:18:07.540 --> 00:18:09.740 align:middle line:90%
and specifically about time.

00:18:09.740 --> 00:18:12.320 align:middle line:90%
So here we are back at time.

00:18:12.320 --> 00:18:14.650 align:middle line:84%
Time is the program
that allows us

00:18:14.650 --> 00:18:18.130 align:middle line:84%
to live our lives as we
do within the operating

00:18:18.130 --> 00:18:20.620 align:middle line:90%
system of the divine matrix.

00:18:20.620 --> 00:18:23.860 align:middle line:84%
What Whorf found was that
in the Hopi language,

00:18:23.860 --> 00:18:27.320 align:middle line:84%
they see everything as alive,
everything is connected,

00:18:27.320 --> 00:18:32.030 align:middle line:90%
everything is present and now.

00:18:32.030 --> 00:18:34.250 align:middle line:84%
From the Hopi perspective,
there are only

00:18:34.250 --> 00:18:36.770 align:middle line:90%
two realms of possibility.

00:18:36.770 --> 00:18:41.270 align:middle line:84%
One is the realm of things that
are manifesting in the present,

00:18:41.270 --> 00:18:44.660 align:middle line:84%
and one is the realm of things
that are already manifest.

00:18:44.660 --> 00:18:47.480 align:middle line:84%
The Hopi do not think
about time the way

00:18:47.480 --> 00:18:50.090 align:middle line:90%
that we think about time.

00:18:50.090 --> 00:18:52.280 align:middle line:84%
From their perspective,
the manifest

00:18:52.280 --> 00:18:55.370 align:middle line:84%
is everything that
has already happened,

00:18:55.370 --> 00:18:57.372 align:middle line:84%
to everything that we
can sense, everything

00:18:57.372 --> 00:18:58.330 align:middle line:90%
that we can experience.

00:18:58.330 --> 00:19:02.210 align:middle line:84%
It's what's already
occurred in the world.

00:19:02.210 --> 00:19:05.270 align:middle line:84%
From this perspective,
the manifesting

00:19:05.270 --> 00:19:08.450 align:middle line:84%
is what is unfolding
in this moment

00:19:08.450 --> 00:19:10.970 align:middle line:84%
and is actually
called in the language

00:19:10.970 --> 00:19:13.070 align:middle line:90%
the spirit of the breath.

00:19:13.070 --> 00:19:16.250 align:middle line:84%
It includes whatever is
unfolding in the moment now

00:19:16.250 --> 00:19:19.200 align:middle line:84%
as well as what's
possible in the future.

00:19:19.200 --> 00:19:22.910 align:middle line:84%
Now, these may seem like
insignificant changes

00:19:22.910 --> 00:19:25.802 align:middle line:84%
that I'm talking about between
the way that the Hopi think

00:19:25.802 --> 00:19:27.260 align:middle line:84%
and the way we
think, but they have

00:19:27.260 --> 00:19:29.870 align:middle line:90%
very powerful implications.

00:19:29.870 --> 00:19:31.760 align:middle line:84%
Let me talk to you
about the concept

00:19:31.760 --> 00:19:34.550 align:middle line:90%
of time in the Hopi language.

00:19:34.550 --> 00:19:38.270 align:middle line:84%
In Hopi, there is no
time as we know it.

00:19:38.270 --> 00:19:40.150 align:middle line:90%
There is only now.

00:19:40.150 --> 00:19:43.590 align:middle line:84%
And what Whorf found when he
was exploring the language

00:19:43.590 --> 00:19:46.970 align:middle line:84%
is that there were no
nouns in the Hopi language

00:19:46.970 --> 00:19:50.810 align:middle line:84%
to specifically refer to
the past or the future.

00:19:50.810 --> 00:19:52.250 align:middle line:90%
Everything is present.

00:19:52.250 --> 00:19:54.740 align:middle line:84%
Everything is
happening right now.

00:19:54.740 --> 00:19:56.810 align:middle line:84%
So for example,
the idea of a wave.

00:19:56.810 --> 00:19:59.210 align:middle line:84%
When we look at the
wave in an ocean,

00:19:59.210 --> 00:20:01.550 align:middle line:90%
we say look at that wave.

00:20:01.550 --> 00:20:04.160 align:middle line:84%
For the Hopi, it's
impossible to see

00:20:04.160 --> 00:20:08.780 align:middle line:84%
one wave in the moment in
time and call it a wave.

00:20:08.780 --> 00:20:12.980 align:middle line:84%
Because it is happening
now, the word is waving.

00:20:12.980 --> 00:20:16.787 align:middle line:84%
When they are looking at the
wave, we say look at the wave,

00:20:16.787 --> 00:20:18.620 align:middle line:84%
but we know there are
other waves out there.

00:20:18.620 --> 00:20:22.070 align:middle line:84%
The Hopi say that
the ocean is waving.

00:20:22.070 --> 00:20:23.210 align:middle line:90%
They actually have a word.

00:20:23.210 --> 00:20:26.720 align:middle line:84%
They say walalata, meaning
the plural waving is

00:20:26.720 --> 00:20:29.090 align:middle line:90%
occurring-- the plural waving.

00:20:29.090 --> 00:20:31.310 align:middle line:84%
So in a very real
sense, their language

00:20:31.310 --> 00:20:33.729 align:middle line:84%
is more accurate
than ours, describing

00:20:33.729 --> 00:20:35.270 align:middle line:84%
what the waves are
doing, although it

00:20:35.270 --> 00:20:40.250 align:middle line:84%
feels awkward to us, because of
the way we're wired to think.

00:20:40.250 --> 00:20:45.070 align:middle line:84%
So the Hopi are using the
same words to describe what is

00:20:45.070 --> 00:20:46.600 align:middle line:90%
or what has already happened.

00:20:46.600 --> 00:20:50.590 align:middle line:84%
They're describing a quantum
possibility that has already

00:20:50.590 --> 00:20:53.380 align:middle line:84%
become manifest, while
leaving the future open

00:20:53.380 --> 00:20:56.750 align:middle line:84%
for other manifestations
and other possibilities.

00:20:56.750 --> 00:20:59.860 align:middle line:84%
Well, when we look at
the movie the "Arrival"

00:20:59.860 --> 00:21:03.400 align:middle line:84%
from this perspective, it
opens up a whole new realm

00:21:03.400 --> 00:21:04.600 align:middle line:90%
of possibilities.

00:21:04.600 --> 00:21:07.430 align:middle line:84%
Because this is the
central theme to the movie.

00:21:07.430 --> 00:21:12.280 align:middle line:84%
In the movie, humankind, through
the language of separation,

00:21:12.280 --> 00:21:14.590 align:middle line:84%
was on the brink of
war, on the brink

00:21:14.590 --> 00:21:16.480 align:middle line:84%
of destruction in
the modern world,

00:21:16.480 --> 00:21:19.450 align:middle line:84%
because of the weapons we
have and the kind of war

00:21:19.450 --> 00:21:21.070 align:middle line:90%
that was possible.

00:21:21.070 --> 00:21:25.120 align:middle line:84%
And it's precisely at
this moment in time

00:21:25.120 --> 00:21:28.420 align:middle line:84%
when a new language is
introduced to the world.

00:21:28.420 --> 00:21:32.110 align:middle line:84%
Now, in the movie it happened
to come from another world,

00:21:32.110 --> 00:21:34.930 align:middle line:90%
and that was the ET perspective.

00:21:34.930 --> 00:21:38.350 align:middle line:84%
But there is a growing
body of scientific evidence

00:21:38.350 --> 00:21:41.380 align:middle line:84%
that suggests something
very similar to what

00:21:41.380 --> 00:21:44.230 align:middle line:84%
happened in the "Arrival"
has already happened here

00:21:44.230 --> 00:21:46.810 align:middle line:84%
on Earth that didn't
necessarily come

00:21:46.810 --> 00:21:48.760 align:middle line:90%
from another world in our time.

00:21:48.760 --> 00:21:52.030 align:middle line:84%
It may have been left
to us in the past.

00:21:52.030 --> 00:21:58.000 align:middle line:10%
Right now, there are 23
examples of ancient texts,

00:21:58.000 --> 00:22:00.640 align:middle line:10%
ancient languages that
were given to the people

00:22:00.640 --> 00:22:04.070 align:middle line:10%
of the Earth that to this
day cannot be translated.

00:22:04.070 --> 00:22:06.100 align:middle line:90%
We don't know what they say.

00:22:06.100 --> 00:22:08.350 align:middle line:84%
And the reason I'm
sharing this is

00:22:08.350 --> 00:22:11.500 align:middle line:84%
because just like the
indigenous language of the Hopi

00:22:11.500 --> 00:22:13.820 align:middle line:90%
is a language of connection.

00:22:13.820 --> 00:22:17.800 align:middle line:84%
And when the Hopi speak in
the language of connection,

00:22:17.800 --> 00:22:21.970 align:middle line:84%
it wires their brain
to see the world

00:22:21.970 --> 00:22:26.050 align:middle line:84%
from a place of connectivity,
of unity, of aliveness,

00:22:26.050 --> 00:22:28.150 align:middle line:90%
of cooperation.

00:22:28.150 --> 00:22:30.790 align:middle line:84%
It's very possible
that at least one,

00:22:30.790 --> 00:22:32.910 align:middle line:84%
if not many of
the languages that

00:22:32.910 --> 00:22:37.810 align:middle line:84%
have been left in the past,
provide precisely the same idea

00:22:37.810 --> 00:22:42.510 align:middle line:84%
with an alphabet that helps us
to find this place of unity.

00:22:42.510 --> 00:22:45.850 align:middle line:84%
And we go back and we think
about this growing body

00:22:45.850 --> 00:22:49.960 align:middle line:84%
of evidence that suggests
consciousness informs itself

00:22:49.960 --> 00:22:51.820 align:middle line:90%
through its creations.

00:22:51.820 --> 00:22:55.990 align:middle line:84%
The movie "Arrival" is
perhaps mirroring to us

00:22:55.990 --> 00:23:00.160 align:middle line:84%
what has already happened in our
past or the potential of what

00:23:00.160 --> 00:23:02.140 align:middle line:84%
we can embrace in
the future, simply

00:23:02.140 --> 00:23:06.820 align:middle line:84%
by recognizing the power of our
language to change our biology.

00:23:06.820 --> 00:23:08.860 align:middle line:84%
Such a different
way of thinking.

00:23:08.860 --> 00:23:12.910 align:middle line:84%
The power of the words
we use again and again

00:23:12.910 --> 00:23:15.670 align:middle line:84%
to trigger the
neurons in our brain

00:23:15.670 --> 00:23:19.600 align:middle line:84%
and in our heart to find other
neurons to wire together,

00:23:19.600 --> 00:23:24.250 align:middle line:84%
so that we become networks of
peace, networks of cooperation,

00:23:24.250 --> 00:23:28.510 align:middle line:84%
networks of unity, rather than
in networks of separation,

00:23:28.510 --> 00:23:32.020 align:middle line:84%
competition, and conflict that
we've achieved in the past

00:23:32.020 --> 00:23:34.690 align:middle line:84%
through the use of a
language that was given to us

00:23:34.690 --> 00:23:35.900 align:middle line:90%
a very long time ago.

00:23:35.900 --> 00:23:38.640 align:middle line:90%


00:23:38.640 --> 00:23:41.850 align:middle line:84%
So maybe it's no accident
that the movie "Arrival"

00:23:41.850 --> 00:23:45.810 align:middle line:84%
has arrived in our
world precisely when it

00:23:45.810 --> 00:23:47.520 align:middle line:90%
has arrived in our world.

00:23:47.520 --> 00:23:49.510 align:middle line:84%
Step back and look
at the big picture.

00:23:49.510 --> 00:23:52.020 align:middle line:90%
We're living a time of extremes.

00:23:52.020 --> 00:23:54.130 align:middle line:84%
We're living a time
unlike any time

00:23:54.130 --> 00:23:57.300 align:middle line:84%
in 5,000 years of recorded
human history when

00:23:57.300 --> 00:24:00.705 align:middle line:84%
huge natural cycles that
include the cycles of climate,

00:24:00.705 --> 00:24:04.950 align:middle line:84%
the cycles of economy, the
cycles of human conflict.

00:24:04.950 --> 00:24:09.210 align:middle line:84%
Each of them are
converging at the same time

00:24:09.210 --> 00:24:12.900 align:middle line:84%
into an experience that
we've never seen before.

00:24:12.900 --> 00:24:15.180 align:middle line:84%
And at the same time
that has happened,

00:24:15.180 --> 00:24:18.270 align:middle line:84%
the people of the world
are being pushed together

00:24:18.270 --> 00:24:20.670 align:middle line:84%
across the boundaries
that we've known

00:24:20.670 --> 00:24:23.330 align:middle line:84%
in the past of
oceans, of mountains,

00:24:23.330 --> 00:24:25.230 align:middle line:90%
the borders between countries.

00:24:25.230 --> 00:24:27.870 align:middle line:84%
People of the world
are coming together.

00:24:27.870 --> 00:24:30.030 align:middle line:84%
And we're learning
what it means to live

00:24:30.030 --> 00:24:32.650 align:middle line:84%
amidst different cultures,
different religions,

00:24:32.650 --> 00:24:35.700 align:middle line:84%
different ways of thinking,
different ways of treating men,

00:24:35.700 --> 00:24:37.830 align:middle line:84%
different ways of
treating women.

00:24:37.830 --> 00:24:41.040 align:middle line:84%
All of this is happening within
the context of the big picture

00:24:41.040 --> 00:24:43.050 align:middle line:90%
of these converging cycles.

00:24:43.050 --> 00:24:46.770 align:middle line:84%
At the very time
when our differences

00:24:46.770 --> 00:24:49.020 align:middle line:84%
have led to the brink
of war in the world

00:24:49.020 --> 00:24:51.840 align:middle line:90%
today, the very instant--

00:24:51.840 --> 00:24:55.740 align:middle line:84%
maybe it's no accident that
the movie "Arrival" arrived

00:24:55.740 --> 00:24:59.130 align:middle line:84%
to remind us of the
power of the language

00:24:59.130 --> 00:25:02.220 align:middle line:84%
to change the way we think about
ourselves and our relationship

00:25:02.220 --> 00:25:03.310 align:middle line:90%
to one another.

00:25:03.310 --> 00:25:05.820 align:middle line:84%
When we think about it
from that perspective,

00:25:05.820 --> 00:25:09.480 align:middle line:84%
in addition to being an awesome
movie and one of my favorites,

00:25:09.480 --> 00:25:11.760 align:middle line:84%
the question that
it begs for me--

00:25:11.760 --> 00:25:15.330 align:middle line:84%
and I'm going to invite you
to think of the same question.

00:25:15.330 --> 00:25:20.640 align:middle line:84%
If our words are a reflection
of what's happening in the world

00:25:20.640 --> 00:25:23.020 align:middle line:84%
and our words are
directing our biology

00:25:23.020 --> 00:25:25.950 align:middle line:84%
in the way our neurons
fire, what words

00:25:25.950 --> 00:25:27.900 align:middle line:90%
are you feeding into the field?

00:25:27.900 --> 00:25:30.540 align:middle line:84%
What words are you
feeding into the matrix?

00:25:30.540 --> 00:25:33.530 align:middle line:84%
What words are you using
to direct your biology?

00:25:33.530 --> 00:25:36.284 align:middle line:84%
And when you become
conscious of the language

00:25:36.284 --> 00:25:37.950 align:middle line:84%
that you're using
from this perspective,

00:25:37.950 --> 00:25:41.640 align:middle line:84%
it opens up a whole new
realm of possibilities.

00:25:41.640 --> 00:25:44.760 align:middle line:84%
And that is the power
of the divine matrix

00:25:44.760 --> 00:25:47.580 align:middle line:84%
and the power of
understanding our language

00:25:47.580 --> 00:25:51.180 align:middle line:84%
and the role of our language
to direct the possibilities

00:25:51.180 --> 00:25:54.100 align:middle line:90%
within that matrix.

00:25:54.100 --> 00:25:55.600 align:middle line:84%
Through the wisdom
preserved in some

00:25:55.600 --> 00:25:58.120 align:middle line:84%
of our most ancient and
cherished, indigenous

00:25:58.120 --> 00:26:01.930 align:middle line:84%
and spiritual traditions,
we can now think of language

00:26:01.930 --> 00:26:05.050 align:middle line:84%
as the user interface for the
operating system of our lives,

00:26:05.050 --> 00:26:06.960 align:middle line:90%
the divine matrix.

00:26:06.960 --> 00:26:09.610 align:middle line:84%
Well, in the next episode,
we'll dive directly

00:26:09.610 --> 00:26:12.700 align:middle line:84%
into the physics of the
matrix itself to discover

00:26:12.700 --> 00:26:16.090 align:middle line:84%
how to transform the hurtful
creations in our lives

00:26:16.090 --> 00:26:18.650 align:middle line:84%
and the healthy outcomes of
relationship and even healing.

00:26:18.650 --> 00:26:21.970 align:middle line:84%
