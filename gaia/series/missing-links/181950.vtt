>>GREGG BRADEN: Hello,
my name's Gregg Braden.

00:00:26.790 --> 00:00:28.790 align:middle line:10%
And I'd like to welcome
you to today's very

00:00:28.790 --> 00:00:31.730 align:middle line:10%
special presentation
of "The Divine Matrix--

00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:35.240 align:middle line:10%
Bridging Time, Space,
Miracles and Belief."

00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:38.810 align:middle line:84%
In the last episode, we saw
how the code of language

00:00:38.810 --> 00:00:41.960 align:middle line:84%
and human emotion allows
us literally to hack

00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:44.210 align:middle line:90%
the field of all possibilities.

00:00:44.210 --> 00:00:48.250 align:middle line:84%
And when we do so, we achieve
superhuman potentials.

00:00:48.250 --> 00:00:52.250 align:middle line:84%
Well, additional discoveries
now catapult us even further.

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:54.950 align:middle line:84%
And they show that you
and I are biologically

00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:58.520 align:middle line:84%
wired to exceed the limits of
what we once believed possible

00:00:58.520 --> 00:00:59.930 align:middle line:90%
in our lives.

00:00:59.930 --> 00:01:04.040 align:middle line:84%
In this episode, we'll discover
how our super inner technology

00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:06.620 align:middle line:84%
works, as well as
the ancient technique

00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:08.210 align:middle line:84%
that uses this
technology to create

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:11.780 align:middle line:84%
the most advanced states of
consciousness known to exist.

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:14.210 align:middle line:84%
When I was in school
in the 1950s, '60s,

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:17.870 align:middle line:84%
and the early '70s, I was
taught that there are four brain

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:20.660 align:middle line:84%
states that we operate
in between our waking

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:23.355 align:middle line:84%
everyday reality and the
deepest states of sleep.

00:01:23.355 --> 00:01:25.850 align:middle line:84%
But new discoveries
have changed all that.

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:27.650 align:middle line:84%
They show us that,
now, those four states

00:01:27.650 --> 00:01:29.690 align:middle line:90%
are only part of the picture.

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:32.000 align:middle line:84%
Now we know that there
are at least twice

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:33.410 align:middle line:90%
that number of brain states--

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:35.730 align:middle line:84%
and I believe, very
possibly, even more.

00:01:35.730 --> 00:01:37.820 align:middle line:90%
Now, here's what I mean by this.

00:01:37.820 --> 00:01:40.610 align:middle line:10%
Typical brain states
of the past began

00:01:40.610 --> 00:01:44.450 align:middle line:10%
at the bottom of the scale
with a very slow delta waves,

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:49.070 align:middle line:10%
the long waves that range
between 0.5 and 3 cycles

00:01:49.070 --> 00:01:51.380 align:middle line:10%
per second or hertz.

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:53.030 align:middle line:84%
These are the waves
that we typically

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:56.210 align:middle line:84%
experience in our really
deep states of sleep,

00:01:56.210 --> 00:01:59.850 align:middle line:84%
sometimes when we don't even
know that we're dreaming.

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:02.770 align:middle line:84%
The next brain state
is a little bit faster.

00:02:02.770 --> 00:02:04.440 align:middle line:84%
But it still is a
slow wave, as well.

00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:06.990 align:middle line:10%
It's called the
theta brain state.

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:08.400 align:middle line:10%
These are long waves.

00:02:08.400 --> 00:02:13.230 align:middle line:10%
They range between 3 cycles
per second, or 3 hertz,

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:15.760 align:middle line:10%
and 8 cycles per second.

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:17.850 align:middle line:84%
So this is the brain
state that we experience

00:02:17.850 --> 00:02:22.170 align:middle line:84%
as, like, light meditation, or
we begin drifting into sleep,

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:23.940 align:middle line:84%
and then the typical
dream states.

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:25.665 align:middle line:84%
And it's also the
brain state that

00:02:25.665 --> 00:02:28.750 align:middle line:84%
is associated with very
deep states of healing.

00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:32.070 align:middle line:84%
And that's going to be important
for where we're going as we go

00:02:32.070 --> 00:02:34.140 align:middle line:90%
through these new brain states.

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:37.620 align:middle line:10%
Well, following the theta
brain state or the alpha waves

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:40.590 align:middle line:10%
that range between
8 and 12 hertz,

00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:42.840 align:middle line:10%
8 and 12 cycles per second--

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:44.850 align:middle line:10%
alpha, that's
where we experience

00:02:44.850 --> 00:02:46.680 align:middle line:10%
a very deep relaxation.

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:48.180 align:middle line:84%
And when we first
begin to meditate,

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:49.597 align:middle line:84%
when you close
your eyes, you take

00:02:49.597 --> 00:02:51.990 align:middle line:84%
those first few deep
breaths, and you

00:02:51.990 --> 00:02:55.050 align:middle line:84%
shift your sympathetic and
parasympathetic nervous

00:02:55.050 --> 00:02:59.310 align:middle line:84%
systems, this is the state
that we begin to drift into.

00:02:59.310 --> 00:03:03.270 align:middle line:10%
And from alpha, the next is
the beta, the very common brain

00:03:03.270 --> 00:03:04.170 align:middle line:10%
state.

00:03:04.170 --> 00:03:07.440 align:middle line:10%
It's typically ranging
between about 12 and 36 cycles

00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:10.230 align:middle line:10%
per second, or 12 and 36 hertz.

00:03:10.230 --> 00:03:15.990 align:middle line:84%
And this is our typical,
everyday waking brain state--

00:03:15.990 --> 00:03:17.790 align:middle line:84%
hopefully, the state
that you're probably

00:03:17.790 --> 00:03:20.020 align:middle line:84%
in when you're
watching me right now.

00:03:20.020 --> 00:03:23.680 align:middle line:84%
So in the past, this is where
our definition of brain states

00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:24.480 align:middle line:90%
has ended.

00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:27.000 align:middle line:84%
When I was in school and
I was in the university,

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:30.720 align:middle line:84%
this is where the definition
of the brain states ended.

00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:33.600 align:middle line:84%
New discoveries now
have changed all that.

00:03:33.600 --> 00:03:35.730 align:middle line:84%
And what I find
really fascinating

00:03:35.730 --> 00:03:38.340 align:middle line:84%
is that these discoveries
were made possible

00:03:38.340 --> 00:03:41.340 align:middle line:84%
through documenting the
meditative techniques

00:03:41.340 --> 00:03:43.410 align:middle line:90%
of Tibetan monks.

00:03:43.410 --> 00:03:48.660 align:middle line:84%
It was only when scientists went
into the monasteries in Tibet--

00:03:48.660 --> 00:03:53.250 align:middle line:84%
and they took, at that time,
relatively primitive equipment.

00:03:53.250 --> 00:03:57.180 align:middle line:84%
And they began to monitor the
brain waves of these monks--

00:03:57.180 --> 00:03:59.550 align:middle line:84%
that they discovered that
something was happening

00:03:59.550 --> 00:04:02.160 align:middle line:84%
in their bodies that
was beyond what had

00:04:02.160 --> 00:04:04.320 align:middle line:90%
been documented in the past.

00:04:04.320 --> 00:04:07.660 align:middle line:84%
Now in the 1990s, Tibet
was very accessible to me.

00:04:07.660 --> 00:04:11.050 align:middle line:84%
I had the opportunity
to do a number of trips,

00:04:11.050 --> 00:04:12.330 align:middle line:90%
of pilgrimages.

00:04:12.330 --> 00:04:15.660 align:middle line:10%
And I was leading
groups for 26-day trips

00:04:15.660 --> 00:04:18.180 align:middle line:10%
through 12 monasteries
and two nunneries

00:04:18.180 --> 00:04:20.839 align:middle line:10%
into some of the highest
altitude monasteries,

00:04:20.839 --> 00:04:24.280 align:middle line:10%
just under 17,000
feet above sea level.

00:04:24.280 --> 00:04:26.950 align:middle line:84%
So I'm sharing this with you,
because I had the opportunity

00:04:26.950 --> 00:04:30.370 align:middle line:84%
to see, amongst the
nuns, the abbots,

00:04:30.370 --> 00:04:33.610 align:middle line:84%
actually practicing
these traditions,

00:04:33.610 --> 00:04:34.960 align:middle line:90%
actually moving into the states.

00:04:34.960 --> 00:04:37.960 align:middle line:84%
And I also had the
opportunity to see the attempt

00:04:37.960 --> 00:04:40.900 align:middle line:84%
to document what some of
these monks were doing.

00:04:40.900 --> 00:04:42.760 align:middle line:84%
And I say and emphasize
the word "attempts."

00:04:42.760 --> 00:04:46.498 align:middle line:84%
Because it didn't work as
well as researchers had hoped.

00:04:46.498 --> 00:04:48.790 align:middle line:84%
They could obviously tell
that something was happening.

00:04:48.790 --> 00:04:51.730 align:middle line:84%
They couldn't really get
a handle on what it was.

00:04:51.730 --> 00:04:55.780 align:middle line:84%
So it was only when they were
able to invite those monks,

00:04:55.780 --> 00:04:59.770 align:middle line:84%
and nuns, and abbots from
those high-altitude monasteries

00:04:59.770 --> 00:05:03.920 align:middle line:84%
in the Tibetan Plateau into the
laboratory here in the United

00:05:03.920 --> 00:05:04.720 align:middle line:90%
States--

00:05:04.720 --> 00:05:07.510 align:middle line:84%
and they used really
sophisticated equipment

00:05:07.510 --> 00:05:10.420 align:middle line:84%
that was too big, too
massive, too heavy

00:05:10.420 --> 00:05:12.670 align:middle line:84%
to transport all
the way into Tibet.

00:05:12.670 --> 00:05:16.840 align:middle line:10%
And they were able to use
scanning techniques, MRIs

00:05:16.840 --> 00:05:21.880 align:middle line:10%
and CT scans to actually see
what was happening in the brain

00:05:21.880 --> 00:05:24.130 align:middle line:10%
and the body of these
people as they were

00:05:24.130 --> 00:05:25.810 align:middle line:10%
going through this process--

00:05:25.810 --> 00:05:28.897 align:middle line:10%
that science was able to
document the advanced brain

00:05:28.897 --> 00:05:30.980 align:middle line:10%
states that I'm going to
share with you right now.

00:05:30.980 --> 00:05:32.780 align:middle line:90%
So all this is relatively new.

00:05:32.780 --> 00:05:35.680 align:middle line:84%
It's at relatively different
way of thinking about it.

00:05:35.680 --> 00:05:37.270 align:middle line:84%
Even recently, I
was at a conference.

00:05:37.270 --> 00:05:40.540 align:middle line:84%
And I was talking to a medical
doctor after a presentation

00:05:40.540 --> 00:05:41.342 align:middle line:90%
that I had made.

00:05:41.342 --> 00:05:42.550 align:middle line:90%
And the doctor came up to me.

00:05:42.550 --> 00:05:45.655 align:middle line:84%
And he said, how come we don't
know about these new brain

00:05:45.655 --> 00:05:46.780 align:middle line:90%
states that you're sharing?

00:05:46.780 --> 00:05:48.980 align:middle line:84%
He said, they're not
teaching us this stuff.

00:05:48.980 --> 00:05:50.908 align:middle line:84%
So this is how new
this information is.

00:05:50.908 --> 00:05:53.200 align:middle line:84%
And I want to emphasize, I
don't think this is the end.

00:05:53.200 --> 00:05:54.590 align:middle line:90%
I don't think it's over.

00:05:54.590 --> 00:05:57.400 align:middle line:84%
I think we've opened the
door to an understanding

00:05:57.400 --> 00:05:59.080 align:middle line:90%
of human potential.

00:05:59.080 --> 00:06:02.980 align:middle line:84%
And now that we know
that potential exists,

00:06:02.980 --> 00:06:04.680 align:middle line:90%
humans are pushing the limits.

00:06:04.680 --> 00:06:07.310 align:middle line:84%
They're pushing the boundaries
of what that potential really

00:06:07.310 --> 00:06:08.110 align:middle line:90%
means.

00:06:08.110 --> 00:06:13.263 align:middle line:84%
And I, for one, am really
excited to see where this goes.

00:06:13.263 --> 00:06:15.430 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to continue with
the advanced brain states

00:06:15.430 --> 00:06:18.010 align:middle line:84%
now that were not in the
books, not in the texts.

00:06:18.010 --> 00:06:19.970 align:middle line:84%
They're not typically
being taught.

00:06:19.970 --> 00:06:22.900 align:middle line:84%
So researchers measuring
the activity of these monks

00:06:22.900 --> 00:06:25.300 align:middle line:84%
and using this new
technology, they

00:06:25.300 --> 00:06:27.520 align:middle line:84%
were surprised when
they discovered,

00:06:27.520 --> 00:06:32.410 align:middle line:84%
first of all, a brain state
above the beta brain state.

00:06:32.410 --> 00:06:36.940 align:middle line:84%
It began where the beta brain
state ended at 36 hertz.

00:06:36.940 --> 00:06:40.300 align:middle line:84%
And it extended as
high as 44 hertz.

00:06:40.300 --> 00:06:42.592 align:middle line:84%
Now you say, well, that
doesn't sound like a whole lot.

00:06:42.592 --> 00:06:44.175 align:middle line:84%
Well, you're going
to see, we're going

00:06:44.175 --> 00:06:45.470 align:middle line:90%
to go beyond that in a moment.

00:06:45.470 --> 00:06:48.440 align:middle line:84%
But this was news to the
researchers at the time.

00:06:48.440 --> 00:06:50.970 align:middle line:84%
So this new brain
state-- they said, well,

00:06:50.970 --> 00:06:52.220 align:middle line:90%
we don't know what to call it.

00:06:52.220 --> 00:06:54.380 align:middle line:84%
But it has different
characteristics.

00:06:54.380 --> 00:06:57.970 align:middle line:84%
They were looking at
the waves from the EEG.

00:06:57.970 --> 00:07:01.270 align:middle line:84%
And from 36 to 44 hertz, the
characteristics of the waves

00:07:01.270 --> 00:07:02.070 align:middle line:90%
are very different.

00:07:02.070 --> 00:07:04.255 align:middle line:84%
So they couldn't
call them high beta.

00:07:04.255 --> 00:07:06.060 align:middle line:84%
And they need to
call them something.

00:07:06.060 --> 00:07:10.450 align:middle line:84%
So following the standards for
the notation used in the past,

00:07:10.450 --> 00:07:12.800 align:middle line:84%
they called this new
brain state gamma.

00:07:12.800 --> 00:07:14.980 align:middle line:10%
This is the gamma brain state.

00:07:14.980 --> 00:07:17.960 align:middle line:10%
And the characteristics of
the gamma were fascinating.

00:07:17.960 --> 00:07:21.160 align:middle line:10%
One of the characteristics
is the sense of well-being,

00:07:21.160 --> 00:07:24.970 align:middle line:10%
the sense of unity, a sense of
connectedness with all things.

00:07:24.970 --> 00:07:28.180 align:middle line:84%
That sense of isolation,
and separation,

00:07:28.180 --> 00:07:31.780 align:middle line:84%
the sense of being a
local, tends to dissipate,

00:07:31.780 --> 00:07:33.610 align:middle line:84%
and you feel more
universal, as has

00:07:33.610 --> 00:07:35.020 align:middle line:84%
been reported
through many people

00:07:35.020 --> 00:07:37.930 align:middle line:90%
meditating and the monks.

00:07:37.930 --> 00:07:41.290 align:middle line:84%
It is a system where we feel
like all systems are go,

00:07:41.290 --> 00:07:43.060 align:middle line:90%
that we're in the zone.

00:07:43.060 --> 00:07:45.010 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes athletes
achieve this state.

00:07:45.010 --> 00:07:47.740 align:middle line:84%
And they may not even
know what to call it.

00:07:47.740 --> 00:07:51.370 align:middle line:84%
But the more the researchers
explored the higher brain

00:07:51.370 --> 00:07:54.880 align:middle line:84%
states revealed by the
monks and the nuns,

00:07:54.880 --> 00:07:57.040 align:middle line:84%
the higher the numbers
appeared to go.

00:07:57.040 --> 00:07:59.350 align:middle line:84%
And they discovered
yet another range

00:07:59.350 --> 00:08:01.930 align:middle line:84%
of waves that had
gamma characteristics.

00:08:01.930 --> 00:08:05.290 align:middle line:84%
But this range extended far
beyond the gamma waves that

00:08:05.290 --> 00:08:06.740 align:middle line:90%
had been measured in the past.

00:08:06.740 --> 00:08:07.540 align:middle line:90%
Listen to this.

00:08:07.540 --> 00:08:12.550 align:middle line:10%
It went from 44 hertz
all the way to 100 hertz.

00:08:12.550 --> 00:08:17.810 align:middle line:10%
Look at the range of this state,
44 to 100 cycles per second.

00:08:17.810 --> 00:08:20.710 align:middle line:84%
But it had the same
characteristics as gamma.

00:08:20.710 --> 00:08:24.110 align:middle line:84%
So it was a higher
form of gamma.

00:08:24.110 --> 00:08:25.780 align:middle line:84%
So this newly-discovered
brain state

00:08:25.780 --> 00:08:28.660 align:middle line:90%
is now called hyper-gamma.

00:08:28.660 --> 00:08:33.580 align:middle line:10%
And it provided the deepest
forms of insight and intuition

00:08:33.580 --> 00:08:36.405 align:middle line:10%
that the monks were
accessing at the time.

00:08:36.405 --> 00:08:38.280 align:middle line:84%
So the researchers, they
were thinking, well,

00:08:38.280 --> 00:08:42.210 align:middle line:84%
we've now reached the end
of the brain's capacity.

00:08:42.210 --> 00:08:44.650 align:middle line:90%
There must not be anything else.

00:08:44.650 --> 00:08:48.990 align:middle line:84%
And when they felt
that, further research

00:08:48.990 --> 00:08:53.280 align:middle line:84%
revealed yet another,
even higher brain state.

00:08:53.280 --> 00:08:56.730 align:middle line:84%
And this, again, was revealed
through the meditation,

00:08:56.730 --> 00:08:58.770 align:middle line:90%
certain kinds of meditation.

00:08:58.770 --> 00:09:01.500 align:middle line:84%
Certain sects of
Tibetan monks have

00:09:01.500 --> 00:09:03.655 align:middle line:90%
been trained in a specific way.

00:09:03.655 --> 00:09:05.280 align:middle line:84%
And this is a rare
brain state that I'm

00:09:05.280 --> 00:09:06.630 align:middle line:90%
going to talk to you about.

00:09:06.630 --> 00:09:09.060 align:middle line:84%
It exceeds everything
believed to be

00:09:09.060 --> 00:09:10.380 align:middle line:90%
humanly possible in the past.

00:09:10.380 --> 00:09:12.510 align:middle line:90%
It exceeds hyper-gamma.

00:09:12.510 --> 00:09:16.860 align:middle line:10%
It begins at the high end of
the hyper-gamma, 100 hertz.

00:09:16.860 --> 00:09:18.060 align:middle line:10%
Listen to this.

00:09:18.060 --> 00:09:23.610 align:middle line:10%
It extends all the way to
200 cycles per second, 200

00:09:23.610 --> 00:09:25.140 align:middle line:10%
hertz in the human brain.

00:09:25.140 --> 00:09:28.370 align:middle line:10%
It's called the
lambda brain state.

00:09:28.370 --> 00:09:30.120 align:middle line:84%
So what happens in the
lambda brain state?

00:09:30.120 --> 00:09:33.330 align:middle line:84%
Well, it's in this state
that the left hemisphere

00:09:33.330 --> 00:09:36.870 align:middle line:84%
and the right hemisphere of
the brain becomes synchronized.

00:09:36.870 --> 00:09:41.490 align:middle line:84%
And in that synchronization,
it allows tremendous levels,

00:09:41.490 --> 00:09:45.090 align:middle line:84%
tremendous states
of self-regulation.

00:09:45.090 --> 00:09:49.810 align:middle line:10%
For example, you may have
seen videos or documentaries

00:09:49.810 --> 00:09:54.690 align:middle line:10%
of monks meditating in subzero
temperatures, in the ice,

00:09:54.690 --> 00:09:58.590 align:middle line:10%
in the snow, in the high
elevations in Nepal or Tibet.

00:09:58.590 --> 00:10:01.380 align:middle line:84%
When you see monks
doing things like this,

00:10:01.380 --> 00:10:07.750 align:middle line:84%
this is happening in this
extended brain state.

00:10:07.750 --> 00:10:10.030 align:middle line:84%
I've seen where, not
only are they doing this,

00:10:10.030 --> 00:10:14.820 align:middle line:84%
but they will drench a cotton
or a linen cloth with water

00:10:14.820 --> 00:10:17.220 align:middle line:84%
and wrap themselves--
the loin cloth.

00:10:17.220 --> 00:10:18.870 align:middle line:84%
And wrap themselves
in a wet cloth

00:10:18.870 --> 00:10:22.020 align:middle line:84%
before going out into the
subzero, freezing temperatures

00:10:22.020 --> 00:10:25.830 align:middle line:84%
or subfreezing temperatures--
subzero and subfreezing.

00:10:25.830 --> 00:10:29.850 align:middle line:84%
And they will sit on
the bare ground, where,

00:10:29.850 --> 00:10:33.480 align:middle line:84%
typically in subzero
temperatures,

00:10:33.480 --> 00:10:35.855 align:middle line:84%
the warmth of our bodies would
create a layer of ice that

00:10:35.855 --> 00:10:36.655 align:middle line:90%
would freeze.

00:10:36.655 --> 00:10:37.690 align:middle line:90%
And we'd stick.

00:10:37.690 --> 00:10:40.190 align:middle line:84%
That's not what
happens to these monks.

00:10:40.190 --> 00:10:41.940 align:middle line:84%
What happens is, as
they're sitting there,

00:10:41.940 --> 00:10:44.820 align:middle line:84%
they go into this deep
meditation, this very high

00:10:44.820 --> 00:10:47.560 align:middle line:84%
level, up to 200 cycles per
second in the brain state.

00:10:47.560 --> 00:10:50.250 align:middle line:90%
It's a high level of meditation.

00:10:50.250 --> 00:10:54.420 align:middle line:84%
And they begin to self-regulate
their body temperature.

00:10:54.420 --> 00:10:55.890 align:middle line:84%
And they self-regulate
to the point

00:10:55.890 --> 00:10:59.230 align:middle line:84%
where steam begins to come
off of the linen or the cotton

00:10:59.230 --> 00:11:00.030 align:middle line:90%
cloths.

00:11:00.030 --> 00:11:03.030 align:middle line:84%
And they may actually dry
on the bodies of the monks.

00:11:03.030 --> 00:11:04.740 align:middle line:84%
The monks regulate
their temperature

00:11:04.740 --> 00:11:07.560 align:middle line:84%
so that the cold is
not a problem for them.

00:11:07.560 --> 00:11:13.410 align:middle line:84%
And in reflection of
that, the snow around them

00:11:13.410 --> 00:11:17.370 align:middle line:84%
actually begins to melt
away in a circumference

00:11:17.370 --> 00:11:20.340 align:middle line:84%
that measures in feet around
the physical body of the monk

00:11:20.340 --> 00:11:22.380 align:middle line:90%
as the heat is radiating.

00:11:22.380 --> 00:11:26.520 align:middle line:84%
So they're able to self-regulate
their personal body

00:11:26.520 --> 00:11:27.900 align:middle line:90%
temperature.

00:11:27.900 --> 00:11:30.420 align:middle line:10%
The ability to do
this is something

00:11:30.420 --> 00:11:32.430 align:middle line:10%
there's only been
recently documented

00:11:32.430 --> 00:11:36.660 align:middle line:10%
through this new brain state,
through the lambda brain

00:11:36.660 --> 00:11:39.720 align:middle line:10%
state I've just described.

00:11:39.720 --> 00:11:44.330 align:middle line:84%
So as astounding as all of these
discoveries sound right now,

00:11:44.330 --> 00:11:47.090 align:middle line:84%
I want you know that they
don't end with the lambda brain

00:11:47.090 --> 00:11:48.440 align:middle line:90%
state.

00:11:48.440 --> 00:11:51.890 align:middle line:84%
A new brain state now
has been discovered.

00:11:51.890 --> 00:11:55.940 align:middle line:84%
This one, it's on the
other end of the spectrum.

00:11:55.940 --> 00:11:57.620 align:middle line:84%
Remember we said
that the delta brain

00:11:57.620 --> 00:12:03.200 align:middle line:84%
state was a long, slow
wave, deep sleep, no dreams.

00:12:03.200 --> 00:12:08.240 align:middle line:84%
That's an extremely low
brain state below delta that

00:12:08.240 --> 00:12:10.080 align:middle line:90%
has recently been discovered.

00:12:10.080 --> 00:12:11.520 align:middle line:90%
Now listen to this.

00:12:11.520 --> 00:12:18.950 align:middle line:10%
It begins at only 0.5 cycles
per second, 1/2 half of a hertz.

00:12:18.950 --> 00:12:24.380 align:middle line:10%
And it ranges downward
to 0, to nothing.

00:12:24.380 --> 00:12:26.990 align:middle line:84%
It is possible for
humans to engage

00:12:26.990 --> 00:12:31.400 align:middle line:84%
in a brain state that brings
the brain activity down

00:12:31.400 --> 00:12:32.750 align:middle line:90%
to a level of 0.

00:12:32.750 --> 00:12:35.720 align:middle line:84%
Nothing is being
emitted from the brain.

00:12:35.720 --> 00:12:38.180 align:middle line:84%
This seemingly
bizarre brain state--

00:12:38.180 --> 00:12:41.710 align:middle line:84%
it's associated with what we
would call suspended animation.

00:12:41.710 --> 00:12:43.640 align:middle line:84%
When the monks
are in this state,

00:12:43.640 --> 00:12:45.930 align:middle line:84%
there is no
detectable heartbeat.

00:12:45.930 --> 00:12:47.510 align:middle line:90%
They cannot detect a pulse.

00:12:47.510 --> 00:12:49.010 align:middle line:84%
There is no
detectable breathing.

00:12:49.010 --> 00:12:51.950 align:middle line:84%
And I want to tell you, the
monks are very much alive.

00:12:51.950 --> 00:12:55.710 align:middle line:84%
And they are very conscious
within this state.

00:12:55.710 --> 00:12:57.590 align:middle line:84%
Now, I'm sharing these
discoveries with you.

00:12:57.590 --> 00:12:59.400 align:middle line:90%
We're going somewhere with this.

00:12:59.400 --> 00:13:02.510 align:middle line:84%
Because if you think about what
I'm saying to you with regard

00:13:02.510 --> 00:13:04.790 align:middle line:84%
to the brain states,
think about what

00:13:04.790 --> 00:13:07.370 align:middle line:84%
this means in terms
of our conversation

00:13:07.370 --> 00:13:09.350 align:middle line:90%
about the divine matrix.

00:13:09.350 --> 00:13:11.670 align:middle line:84%
That matrix is a
field of energy.

00:13:11.670 --> 00:13:14.390 align:middle line:10%
Once again-- I'm going
emphasize this again and again,

00:13:14.390 --> 00:13:16.160 align:middle line:10%
because we're so
conditioned to think

00:13:16.160 --> 00:13:17.825 align:middle line:10%
of ourselves in the field.

00:13:17.825 --> 00:13:19.200 align:middle line:84%
It's not that
we're in the field.

00:13:19.200 --> 00:13:20.750 align:middle line:90%
We are the field.

00:13:20.750 --> 00:13:27.800 align:middle line:84%
The field is every atom of
our bodies constantly emerging

00:13:27.800 --> 00:13:32.030 align:middle line:84%
in these quantum
pulses from this field.

00:13:32.030 --> 00:13:34.570 align:middle line:84%
And our ability to
interact with this field

00:13:34.570 --> 00:13:38.210 align:middle line:84%
is determined by our
heart and our brain state.

00:13:38.210 --> 00:13:40.970 align:middle line:84%
So what I'm sharing with
you are brain states

00:13:40.970 --> 00:13:46.430 align:middle line:84%
that now give us access
to places and experiences

00:13:46.430 --> 00:13:50.240 align:middle line:84%
in this field in ways
that science has never

00:13:50.240 --> 00:13:51.350 align:middle line:90%
recognized in the past.

00:13:51.350 --> 00:13:54.230 align:middle line:84%
Now, I'm not saying that ancient
and indigenous peoples didn't

00:13:54.230 --> 00:13:54.590 align:middle line:90%
know this.

00:13:54.590 --> 00:13:55.310 align:middle line:90%
Of course, they did.

00:13:55.310 --> 00:13:56.685 align:middle line:84%
I mean, the monks
have been doing

00:13:56.685 --> 00:13:59.110 align:middle line:90%
this for at least 1,500 years.

00:13:59.110 --> 00:14:01.460 align:middle line:84%
But it has not been
documented scientifically.

00:14:01.460 --> 00:14:04.460 align:middle line:84%
And this is important,
because this is how science

00:14:04.460 --> 00:14:06.640 align:middle line:90%
builds the new human story.

00:14:06.640 --> 00:14:09.650 align:middle line:84%
The story tells us
about ourselves.

00:14:09.650 --> 00:14:11.660 align:middle line:84%
And in a future
episode in this series,

00:14:11.660 --> 00:14:14.030 align:middle line:84%
you're going to see why
that story is so important.

00:14:14.030 --> 00:14:15.830 align:middle line:84%
And it brings all of
this back to what's

00:14:15.830 --> 00:14:18.920 align:middle line:84%
happening in your life, in
my life, and in our world,

00:14:18.920 --> 00:14:21.980 align:middle line:84%
and between nations on the
global stage right now.

00:14:21.980 --> 00:14:23.660 align:middle line:84%
So this is more than
just interesting.

00:14:23.660 --> 00:14:25.520 align:middle line:90%
I hope it is interesting to you.

00:14:25.520 --> 00:14:27.480 align:middle line:84%
It's more than a
philosophical conversation.

00:14:27.480 --> 00:14:30.380 align:middle line:84%
We're talking about
the nuts and bolts,

00:14:30.380 --> 00:14:32.750 align:middle line:84%
about the internal
technology that

00:14:32.750 --> 00:14:37.673 align:middle line:84%
allows us to have direct
access to this field.

00:14:37.673 --> 00:14:39.600 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:14:39.600 --> 00:14:42.860 align:middle line:84%
So I'm sharing all of
these discoveries because

00:14:42.860 --> 00:14:47.540 align:middle line:84%
of yet an additional discovery
that now links these brain

00:14:47.540 --> 00:14:51.200 align:middle line:84%
states, the highest of the
high and the lowest of the low.

00:14:51.200 --> 00:14:53.810 align:middle line:84%
It links these brain
states in a way

00:14:53.810 --> 00:14:57.610 align:middle line:84%
that tells us even more about
our relationship to the matrix.

00:14:57.610 --> 00:14:59.110 align:middle line:84%
Scientists have
recently discovered

00:14:59.110 --> 00:15:02.950 align:middle line:84%
this very curious link between
the low of the epsilon--

00:15:02.950 --> 00:15:05.830 align:middle line:84%
remember it goes from 0.5
hertz all the way to 0--

00:15:05.830 --> 00:15:07.790 align:middle line:90%
and the high of the lambda.

00:15:07.790 --> 00:15:11.200 align:middle line:10%
It goes all the way up to 200
cycles per second, 200 hertz.

00:15:11.200 --> 00:15:13.900 align:middle line:10%
As different as they
are in frequency--

00:15:13.900 --> 00:15:17.560 align:middle line:10%
this is so interesting--
they both allow

00:15:17.560 --> 00:15:21.400 align:middle line:10%
for precisely the same
state of consciousness.

00:15:21.400 --> 00:15:22.870 align:middle line:90%
Think about that.

00:15:22.870 --> 00:15:25.480 align:middle line:84%
As different as they are,
from the highest state

00:15:25.480 --> 00:15:27.190 align:middle line:90%
to the lowest state--

00:15:27.190 --> 00:15:28.930 align:middle line:84%
different ways of
getting there--

00:15:28.930 --> 00:15:33.160 align:middle line:84%
they both bring us to
precisely the same state

00:15:33.160 --> 00:15:35.050 align:middle line:90%
of consciousness.

00:15:35.050 --> 00:15:38.710 align:middle line:84%
The one difference is
that, when we achieve

00:15:38.710 --> 00:15:42.190 align:middle line:84%
the low state of consciousness
through the epsilon brain

00:15:42.190 --> 00:15:49.330 align:middle line:84%
state, we achieve it through
a very drowsy state that

00:15:49.330 --> 00:15:52.960 align:middle line:84%
typically would allow us
to facilitate a deep sleep.

00:15:52.960 --> 00:15:55.780 align:middle line:84%
But when we access the
state of consciousness

00:15:55.780 --> 00:15:59.440 align:middle line:84%
through the very high state of
lambda, we don't get drowsy.

00:15:59.440 --> 00:16:03.460 align:middle line:84%
We go into this state of
consciousness in a very full

00:16:03.460 --> 00:16:05.950 align:middle line:90%
and a very awakened state.

00:16:05.950 --> 00:16:07.840 align:middle line:84%
So the implications
for the discovery

00:16:07.840 --> 00:16:11.320 align:middle line:84%
could fill an entire media
special into themselves.

00:16:11.320 --> 00:16:13.330 align:middle line:84%
But for the purposes of
what we're doing here,

00:16:13.330 --> 00:16:15.100 align:middle line:84%
for the purpose
of our exploration

00:16:15.100 --> 00:16:17.650 align:middle line:84%
of the divine matrix,
it appears that there

00:16:17.650 --> 00:16:21.220 align:middle line:84%
is a circular link of
brain states leading

00:16:21.220 --> 00:16:23.290 align:middle line:84%
to different states
of consciousness.

00:16:23.290 --> 00:16:26.140 align:middle line:84%
And they all give
us specific kinds

00:16:26.140 --> 00:16:29.780 align:middle line:84%
of access to specific
places in the matrix.

00:16:29.780 --> 00:16:31.330 align:middle line:90%
You achieve the brain state.

00:16:31.330 --> 00:16:33.790 align:middle line:84%
And you tune into that
place in the field.

00:16:33.790 --> 00:16:36.410 align:middle line:84%
So it may be that what
appears to be our deepest

00:16:36.410 --> 00:16:38.410 align:middle line:84%
states of relaxation
are actually

00:16:38.410 --> 00:16:42.570 align:middle line:84%
the doorway to our most
awakened states of awareness.

00:16:42.570 --> 00:16:46.880 align:middle line:10%
So when we talk about the gamma
brain state, for example--

00:16:46.880 --> 00:16:49.490 align:middle line:10%
I'm going to go back to gamma,
because it is one of the most

00:16:49.490 --> 00:16:50.450 align:middle line:10%
common brain states.

00:16:50.450 --> 00:16:54.080 align:middle line:10%
We typically achieve
gamma in our lives.

00:16:54.080 --> 00:16:57.870 align:middle line:84%
We're averaging right
around 44 cycles per second.

00:16:57.870 --> 00:17:00.440 align:middle line:84%
But we typically achieve
it spontaneously.

00:17:00.440 --> 00:17:02.945 align:middle line:84%
It seems to happen under
certain conditions.

00:17:02.945 --> 00:17:04.700 align:middle line:84%
And one of the first
questions people

00:17:04.700 --> 00:17:06.680 align:middle line:84%
ask me is, where
does it come from?

00:17:06.680 --> 00:17:09.140 align:middle line:84%
And how do we create
this state intentionally?

00:17:09.140 --> 00:17:12.480 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to answer both
questions right here.

00:17:12.480 --> 00:17:15.920 align:middle line:84%
First of all, where does this
gamma brain state come from?

00:17:15.920 --> 00:17:17.030 align:middle line:90%
I want to be very clear.

00:17:17.030 --> 00:17:21.450 align:middle line:84%
When I talk about gamma
brainwaves and gamma waves,

00:17:21.450 --> 00:17:24.349 align:middle line:84%
these are very different
than the gamma waves

00:17:24.349 --> 00:17:26.030 align:middle line:84%
that we talk about
in the cosmos.

00:17:26.030 --> 00:17:29.075 align:middle line:84%
I'm not talking about
cosmic gamma waves.

00:17:29.075 --> 00:17:30.590 align:middle line:84%
It's the same
terminology, but it's

00:17:30.590 --> 00:17:32.090 align:middle line:84%
a completely different
kind of wave.

00:17:32.090 --> 00:17:34.070 align:middle line:84%
So I want to make
that distinction here.

00:17:34.070 --> 00:17:37.700 align:middle line:84%
The gamma brainwave
originates from a tiny organ

00:17:37.700 --> 00:17:39.300 align:middle line:90%
in the center of our brain.

00:17:39.300 --> 00:17:41.090 align:middle line:90%
It's called the thalamus.

00:17:41.090 --> 00:17:44.280 align:middle line:84%
From this tiny organ
in the thalamus--

00:17:44.280 --> 00:17:48.690 align:middle line:84%
it's in the center of the brain
just above the spinal column--

00:17:48.690 --> 00:17:51.830 align:middle line:90%
these super fast waves--

00:17:51.830 --> 00:17:55.290 align:middle line:84%
if you can imagine this--
they shoot from the thalamus.

00:17:55.290 --> 00:17:59.190 align:middle line:84%
And they go to the front
of the brain, and the back

00:17:59.190 --> 00:18:01.770 align:middle line:84%
of the brain, and to
the front of the brain

00:18:01.770 --> 00:18:07.440 align:middle line:84%
again at this incredibly
high speed of 40 times

00:18:07.440 --> 00:18:08.640 align:middle line:90%
every second--

00:18:08.640 --> 00:18:09.440 align:middle line:90%
40 times!

00:18:09.440 --> 00:18:11.680 align:middle line:90%
OK, that's a second--

00:18:11.680 --> 00:18:12.590 align:middle line:90%
1,001.

00:18:12.590 --> 00:18:16.350 align:middle line:84%
That's a second-- right
there, 40 times, gamma waves,

00:18:16.350 --> 00:18:17.880 align:middle line:84%
if I were in the
gamma state, would

00:18:17.880 --> 00:18:20.128 align:middle line:84%
have pulsed from the
front to the back,

00:18:20.128 --> 00:18:21.920 align:middle line:84%
to the front to the
back of my brain again.

00:18:21.920 --> 00:18:26.520 align:middle line:84%
Just to give you a sense
for how fast this is,

00:18:26.520 --> 00:18:30.270 align:middle line:84%
have you ever seen a
hummingbird's wings?

00:18:30.270 --> 00:18:32.180 align:middle line:84%
We actually hear them
before we see them.

00:18:32.180 --> 00:18:37.050 align:middle line:84%
A hummingbird's wings beat
at the rate of about 50 times

00:18:37.050 --> 00:18:38.290 align:middle line:90%
per second.

00:18:38.290 --> 00:18:41.130 align:middle line:84%
So this gamma brain state
is just a little bit slower

00:18:41.130 --> 00:18:42.450 align:middle line:90%
than the hummingbird's wings.

00:18:42.450 --> 00:18:45.150 align:middle line:84%
And that really helps
to give me some sense

00:18:45.150 --> 00:18:48.000 align:middle line:90%
for how amazing this state is.

00:18:48.000 --> 00:18:49.380 align:middle line:90%
But as these waves--

00:18:49.380 --> 00:18:52.700 align:middle line:84%
not only are they moving very
quickly through the brain.

00:18:52.700 --> 00:18:54.670 align:middle line:84%
Now listen to what
they're doing.

00:18:54.670 --> 00:18:56.970 align:middle line:84%
It's not that they are in a
narrow focus from the front

00:18:56.970 --> 00:18:58.450 align:middle line:90%
to the back, front to the back.

00:18:58.450 --> 00:18:59.770 align:middle line:90%
They are all encompassing.

00:18:59.770 --> 00:19:01.550 align:middle line:90%
It's called a sweeping wave.

00:19:01.550 --> 00:19:04.350 align:middle line:84%
The gamma wave
sweeps through all

00:19:04.350 --> 00:19:07.470 align:middle line:84%
of the lobes of the brain,
the front and the back.

00:19:07.470 --> 00:19:11.910 align:middle line:10%
And that is why it is also
called a unifying brain wave.

00:19:11.910 --> 00:19:15.900 align:middle line:10%
It offers the experience of a
number of different potentials.

00:19:15.900 --> 00:19:19.080 align:middle line:10%
And one of those is this
unifying experience.

00:19:19.080 --> 00:19:21.030 align:middle line:84%
When people are in
gamma, they seem

00:19:21.030 --> 00:19:24.350 align:middle line:84%
to feel less separate
from the world.

00:19:24.350 --> 00:19:26.490 align:middle line:84%
And I'll just
share with you why.

00:19:26.490 --> 00:19:30.540 align:middle line:84%
If you are able to
see the brain scans,

00:19:30.540 --> 00:19:35.850 align:middle line:84%
there's a part of our brain just
above the occipital area that

00:19:35.850 --> 00:19:41.940 align:middle line:84%
lights up when we sense
that we are somewhere

00:19:41.940 --> 00:19:43.590 align:middle line:90%
in a place in time.

00:19:43.590 --> 00:19:46.750 align:middle line:90%
It is our awareness of space.

00:19:46.750 --> 00:19:49.915 align:middle line:84%
So when we say, we're anchored
in this moment in time,

00:19:49.915 --> 00:19:51.540 align:middle line:84%
in the space, we're
present in the here

00:19:51.540 --> 00:19:55.620 align:middle line:84%
and now, that part of
the brain is very active.

00:19:55.620 --> 00:19:58.020 align:middle line:84%
In the gamma brain state,
what the scans show

00:19:58.020 --> 00:20:00.780 align:middle line:84%
is that part of the brain
becomes less active.

00:20:00.780 --> 00:20:07.020 align:middle line:84%
Because we're not so attached
to the space and the place.

00:20:07.020 --> 00:20:11.490 align:middle line:84%
We become more of the
essence of our environment.

00:20:11.490 --> 00:20:13.440 align:middle line:84%
And this is the
unity consciousness.

00:20:13.440 --> 00:20:15.310 align:middle line:84%
And it exemplifies
one of the benefits.

00:20:15.310 --> 00:20:17.940 align:middle line:84%
Why would we want to
access a gamma brain state?

00:20:17.940 --> 00:20:20.580 align:middle line:84%
Let me just go through a
list of some of the benefits

00:20:20.580 --> 00:20:21.940 align:middle line:90%
from the gamma brain state.

00:20:21.940 --> 00:20:23.790 align:middle line:84%
And let's talk about
how we can achieve

00:20:23.790 --> 00:20:26.620 align:middle line:90%
gamma brain state in our lives.

00:20:26.620 --> 00:20:30.100 align:middle line:84%
When we are in the gamma
brain state, as I said,

00:20:30.100 --> 00:20:33.310 align:middle line:84%
we achieve this sense
of unity consciousness.

00:20:33.310 --> 00:20:34.810 align:middle line:84%
And this is something
that the monks

00:20:34.810 --> 00:20:37.780 align:middle line:84%
talk about all the time,
the Tibetan monks, and nuns,

00:20:37.780 --> 00:20:40.480 align:middle line:84%
and the abbots, the
higher-order monks.

00:20:40.480 --> 00:20:44.380 align:middle line:84%
We achieve super cognitive
enhancement and super memory

00:20:44.380 --> 00:20:45.340 align:middle line:90%
recall.

00:20:45.340 --> 00:20:48.340 align:middle line:84%
If you've ever seen any
of the very popular movies

00:20:48.340 --> 00:20:52.000 align:middle line:84%
based on Jason Bourne,
the Jason Bourne series.

00:20:52.000 --> 00:20:54.580 align:middle line:84%
And I call this the
Jason Bourne brain state.

00:20:54.580 --> 00:20:57.310 align:middle line:84%
Because our intelligence
agencies are actually

00:20:57.310 --> 00:21:00.095 align:middle line:84%
training agents to
achieve this gamma brain

00:21:00.095 --> 00:21:01.720 align:middle line:84%
state for many of
the benefits that I'm

00:21:01.720 --> 00:21:03.100 align:middle line:90%
sharing with you right now--

00:21:03.100 --> 00:21:04.038 align:middle line:90%
super fast learning.

00:21:04.038 --> 00:21:05.830 align:middle line:84%
If you want to learn
something really fast,

00:21:05.830 --> 00:21:08.440 align:middle line:84%
if you want to learn a
language very quickly, if you

00:21:08.440 --> 00:21:11.420 align:middle line:84%
want to memorize
information in a book--

00:21:11.420 --> 00:21:12.870 align:middle line:90%
And when I was in college--

00:21:12.870 --> 00:21:16.120 align:middle line:84%
and I shared this
an earlier episode--

00:21:16.120 --> 00:21:19.893 align:middle line:84%
I had full credit, 19 credits,
in my earth sciences major.

00:21:19.893 --> 00:21:21.310 align:middle line:84%
I was paying
out-of-state tuition.

00:21:21.310 --> 00:21:22.110 align:middle line:90%
I had no money.

00:21:22.110 --> 00:21:23.770 align:middle line:90%
I was working three jobs.

00:21:23.770 --> 00:21:26.500 align:middle line:84%
One of those jobs was a job
that lasted from midnight

00:21:26.500 --> 00:21:27.370 align:middle line:90%
until 8:00 AM.

00:21:27.370 --> 00:21:29.200 align:middle line:10%
And my first class was at 10:00.

00:21:29.200 --> 00:21:31.630 align:middle line:10%
I didn't have a lot of
time for sleep or homework.

00:21:31.630 --> 00:21:35.230 align:middle line:84%
Now, I didn't know then
the details and the science

00:21:35.230 --> 00:21:36.700 align:middle line:90%
of what I'm saying to you.

00:21:36.700 --> 00:21:39.970 align:middle line:84%
What I learned then was
through my experiences

00:21:39.970 --> 00:21:43.870 align:middle line:84%
with indigenous people and my
own personal experimentation.

00:21:43.870 --> 00:21:47.110 align:middle line:84%
I learned how to be able
to absorb information

00:21:47.110 --> 00:21:47.910 align:middle line:90%
very quickly.

00:21:47.910 --> 00:21:50.670 align:middle line:84%
You can imagine in the
science major, biology,

00:21:50.670 --> 00:21:54.070 align:middle line:84%
it's all about
fila, and species.

00:21:54.070 --> 00:21:56.350 align:middle line:84%
And in earth
sciences major, it's

00:21:56.350 --> 00:21:59.320 align:middle line:84%
all about crystallography,
and mineralogy, and crystal

00:21:59.320 --> 00:22:02.290 align:middle line:84%
classes, and x-axis,
and z-axes, and y-axes,

00:22:02.290 --> 00:22:03.540 align:middle line:90%
and all those things.

00:22:03.540 --> 00:22:06.040 align:middle line:84%
I had to memorize this
stuff really fast.

00:22:06.040 --> 00:22:09.970 align:middle line:84%
This technique that I'm going
to share with you and this state

00:22:09.970 --> 00:22:12.530 align:middle line:84%
is what gave me the ability
to do that successfully--

00:22:12.530 --> 00:22:16.970 align:middle line:84%
so super, super learning,
super cognitive enhancement,

00:22:16.970 --> 00:22:19.090 align:middle line:90%
super memory recall.

00:22:19.090 --> 00:22:20.530 align:middle line:90%
We all take in the information.

00:22:20.530 --> 00:22:23.810 align:middle line:84%
We have the ability to recall
it-- super focus, really,

00:22:23.810 --> 00:22:25.600 align:middle line:84%
really fast information
processing--

00:22:25.600 --> 00:22:27.520 align:middle line:90%
I mean, just like that.

00:22:27.520 --> 00:22:30.970 align:middle line:84%
Gamma brain state is also
a natural antidepressant.

00:22:30.970 --> 00:22:33.580 align:middle line:84%
People who are in gamma, during
the time they're in gamma,

00:22:33.580 --> 00:22:34.810 align:middle line:90%
they're much calmer.

00:22:34.810 --> 00:22:38.630 align:middle line:84%
And their body is not in
a fight or flight mode.

00:22:38.630 --> 00:22:41.800 align:middle line:84%
And it is not in the mode
releasing the chemicals

00:22:41.800 --> 00:22:44.680 align:middle line:84%
and the hormones that
contribute to the depression.

00:22:44.680 --> 00:22:46.980 align:middle line:84%
It also gives us
access to the deepest

00:22:46.980 --> 00:22:49.310 align:middle line:90%
states of intuition on demand.

00:22:49.310 --> 00:22:50.530 align:middle line:90%
And this is the key.

00:22:50.530 --> 00:22:52.630 align:middle line:90%
We all have intuition.

00:22:52.630 --> 00:22:55.702 align:middle line:84%
Often, our intuition
happens when it happens.

00:22:55.702 --> 00:22:57.160 align:middle line:84%
It happens when
we're in the shower

00:22:57.160 --> 00:23:01.630 align:middle line:84%
in the privacy of our own home
and that very primal experience

00:23:01.630 --> 00:23:03.520 align:middle line:90%
of water pouring over us.

00:23:03.520 --> 00:23:05.960 align:middle line:84%
We have deep insights into
our work, our friendships,

00:23:05.960 --> 00:23:06.760 align:middle line:90%
our relationships.

00:23:06.760 --> 00:23:08.510 align:middle line:84%
We get out of the shower,
and boom, they're gone.

00:23:08.510 --> 00:23:08.970 align:middle line:90%
Where do they go?

00:23:08.970 --> 00:23:11.470 align:middle line:84%
Or you're sitting in a traffic
light waiting for a light

00:23:11.470 --> 00:23:12.310 align:middle line:90%
to turn green.

00:23:12.310 --> 00:23:13.510 align:middle line:84%
And you don't know when
that's going to happen.

00:23:13.510 --> 00:23:14.620 align:middle line:84%
So you don't want
to start anything.

00:23:14.620 --> 00:23:15.880 align:middle line:90%
So you're just there.

00:23:15.880 --> 00:23:18.717 align:middle line:84%
And it's in that openness
when those insights come in.

00:23:18.717 --> 00:23:20.800 align:middle line:84%
And then all of the sudden,
the light turns green.

00:23:20.800 --> 00:23:22.960 align:middle line:84%
And you're off looking at
the vehicle in front of you

00:23:22.960 --> 00:23:24.377 align:middle line:84%
or checking your
rear view mirror.

00:23:24.377 --> 00:23:25.960 align:middle line:90%
And those insights are gone.

00:23:25.960 --> 00:23:26.890 align:middle line:90%
Those are spontaneous.

00:23:26.890 --> 00:23:30.580 align:middle line:84%
How do you achieve that when
you want it the most, on demand?

00:23:30.580 --> 00:23:33.850 align:middle line:84%
Gamma is the answer to
that and much, much more.

00:23:33.850 --> 00:23:38.620 align:middle line:84%
And because of the link between
the high gamma brain state

00:23:38.620 --> 00:23:41.450 align:middle line:84%
and theta where the
healing happens,

00:23:41.450 --> 00:23:42.640 align:middle line:90%
there is a direct link.

00:23:42.640 --> 00:23:44.800 align:middle line:84%
Some of our deepest
states of healing

00:23:44.800 --> 00:23:47.350 align:middle line:90%
begin in the gamma brain state.

00:23:47.350 --> 00:23:49.060 align:middle line:84%
So I'm just giving
you some examples

00:23:49.060 --> 00:23:51.940 align:middle line:84%
of how powerful this
state is and why

00:23:51.940 --> 00:23:57.010 align:middle line:84%
we would want to access this
very powerful state on demand.

00:23:57.010 --> 00:24:00.960 align:middle line:84%
So with all these benefits in
mind, the obvious question is,

00:24:00.960 --> 00:24:01.760 align:middle line:90%
how do we do it?

00:24:01.760 --> 00:24:04.850 align:middle line:84%
How do we access this powerful
state of consciousness?

00:24:04.850 --> 00:24:07.240 align:middle line:84%
And this is one of
those places where

00:24:07.240 --> 00:24:11.380 align:middle line:84%
my direct experience in
Tibet give me the opportunity

00:24:11.380 --> 00:24:14.370 align:middle line:84%
to answer this
question firsthand.

00:24:14.370 --> 00:24:18.010 align:middle line:84%
So in season one of this
series, of "Missing Links,"

00:24:18.010 --> 00:24:23.170 align:middle line:84%
I described the 1991 discovery
of the 40,000 specialized

00:24:23.170 --> 00:24:26.440 align:middle line:84%
cells in the human heart,
sensory neurites, that

00:24:26.440 --> 00:24:29.420 align:middle line:84%
are focused in the heart
in a way that is called

00:24:29.420 --> 00:24:30.670 align:middle line:90%
the little brain of the heart.

00:24:30.670 --> 00:24:32.740 align:middle line:84%
It is a neural network
that is not a brain.

00:24:32.740 --> 00:24:34.060 align:middle line:90%
It's in the heart.

00:24:34.060 --> 00:24:37.142 align:middle line:84%
These sensory neurites are
essentially brain cells,

00:24:37.142 --> 00:24:38.350 align:middle line:90%
but they're not in the brain.

00:24:38.350 --> 00:24:40.620 align:middle line:84%
But they function the
way that brain cells do.

00:24:40.620 --> 00:24:41.420 align:middle line:90%
They think.

00:24:41.420 --> 00:24:42.400 align:middle line:90%
They feel.

00:24:42.400 --> 00:24:46.480 align:middle line:84%
They remember independently
of our cranial brain.

00:24:46.480 --> 00:24:49.150 align:middle line:84%
And when I shared
that with you, I also

00:24:49.150 --> 00:24:52.120 align:middle line:84%
opened the door to the potential
for the gamma brain state.

00:24:52.120 --> 00:24:54.190 align:middle line:90%
Here's what I mean by that.

00:24:54.190 --> 00:24:57.910 align:middle line:84%
In season 1, I shared
a technique that's

00:24:57.910 --> 00:25:00.700 align:middle line:84%
been developed in the laboratory
that reflects what some are

00:25:00.700 --> 00:25:03.790 align:middle line:84%
most ancient and
indigenous traditions

00:25:03.790 --> 00:25:09.130 align:middle line:84%
have taught us about harmonizing
the heart and the brain, two

00:25:09.130 --> 00:25:13.340 align:middle line:84%
organs, into a single,
potent system in our body.

00:25:13.340 --> 00:25:16.480 align:middle line:84%
So what we're really doing
is we are harmonizing neurons

00:25:16.480 --> 00:25:20.790 align:middle line:84%
in the brain and the neurons in
the heart, two separate organs.

00:25:20.790 --> 00:25:22.470 align:middle line:90%
The neurons are in two places.

00:25:22.470 --> 00:25:26.640 align:middle line:84%
We're harmonizing them into a
single, potent system called

00:25:26.640 --> 00:25:29.430 align:middle line:84%
heart brain harmony
or, more specifically,

00:25:29.430 --> 00:25:31.692 align:middle line:90%
heart brain coherence.

00:25:31.692 --> 00:25:33.150 align:middle line:84%
So if this is new
to you, I'm going

00:25:33.150 --> 00:25:34.858 align:middle line:84%
to invite you to go
back to season number

00:25:34.858 --> 00:25:36.630 align:middle line:90%
1 of "Missing Links."

00:25:36.630 --> 00:25:38.490 align:middle line:84%
And check out the
episodes where we're

00:25:38.490 --> 00:25:40.620 align:middle line:84%
talking about harmonizing
the heart and the brain

00:25:40.620 --> 00:25:41.940 align:middle line:90%
and the specific techniques.

00:25:41.940 --> 00:25:43.290 align:middle line:90%
I'm going to refer to them here.

00:25:43.290 --> 00:25:44.175 align:middle line:90%
But I detail them.

00:25:44.175 --> 00:25:46.050 align:middle line:84%
And I want you to know,
that detail is there.

00:25:46.050 --> 00:25:48.340 align:middle line:90%
I'm not just glossing over this.

00:25:48.340 --> 00:25:51.150 align:middle line:84%
So now that we
understand that it's

00:25:51.150 --> 00:25:54.090 align:middle line:84%
possible to harmonize the
heart and the brain and that

00:25:54.090 --> 00:25:59.400 align:middle line:84%
through breath and focus, we may
create this very, very powerful

00:25:59.400 --> 00:26:02.550 align:middle line:84%
state of coherence between
the heart and the brain--

00:26:02.550 --> 00:26:05.358 align:middle line:84%
coherence is defined
as 0.1 hertz.

00:26:05.358 --> 00:26:07.650 align:middle line:84%
When we can create a signal
between the heart and brain

00:26:07.650 --> 00:26:12.600 align:middle line:84%
of 0.1 hertz, we are
in this optimal place

00:26:12.600 --> 00:26:17.270 align:middle line:84%
where our body senses that
all systems are enabled.

00:26:17.270 --> 00:26:20.423 align:middle line:84%
It's in this place where
we are at our best.

00:26:20.423 --> 00:26:21.340 align:middle line:10%
And this is no secret.

00:26:21.340 --> 00:26:25.540 align:middle line:10%
Athletes at the Olympic Training
Center in Colorado Springs

00:26:25.540 --> 00:26:27.800 align:middle line:10%
are using these
techniques to optimize

00:26:27.800 --> 00:26:32.050 align:middle line:10%
their physical performance at
very high rates of metabolism.

00:26:32.050 --> 00:26:33.700 align:middle line:84%
This isn't something
you have to do

00:26:33.700 --> 00:26:36.430 align:middle line:84%
when you're in a deep meditative
state and completely relaxed.

00:26:36.430 --> 00:26:40.870 align:middle line:10%
The US military is using the
techniques, the very techniques

00:26:40.870 --> 00:26:45.250 align:middle line:10%
I'm sharing with you now to hone
the focus of our men and women

00:26:45.250 --> 00:26:49.240 align:middle line:10%
before they go into combat to
optimize their opportunities

00:26:49.240 --> 00:26:52.570 align:middle line:10%
for success but also, when
they return from combat,

00:26:52.570 --> 00:26:56.020 align:middle line:10%
to help them to reintegrate into
their homes and their families

00:26:56.020 --> 00:27:00.130 align:middle line:10%
and leave the battlefield
reflexes behind.

00:27:00.130 --> 00:27:01.750 align:middle line:84%
They serve them in
the battlefield,

00:27:01.750 --> 00:27:03.580 align:middle line:84%
but they don't necessarily
serve them when

00:27:03.580 --> 00:27:05.300 align:middle line:90%
they return to their homes.

00:27:05.300 --> 00:27:06.760 align:middle line:90%
So this is an optimum state.

00:27:06.760 --> 00:27:08.590 align:middle line:90%
All systems go.

00:27:08.590 --> 00:27:12.940 align:middle line:84%
Now, in this state,
one of the techniques

00:27:12.940 --> 00:27:16.780 align:middle line:84%
that I shared with you was to
create an emotional experience,

00:27:16.780 --> 00:27:18.130 align:middle line:90%
a feeling.

00:27:18.130 --> 00:27:20.710 align:middle line:84%
And the feelings
that I recommended

00:27:20.710 --> 00:27:22.880 align:middle line:84%
from the laboratory-- the
Institute of HeartMath

00:27:22.880 --> 00:27:25.750 align:middle line:84%
in Northern California is
developing these techniques

00:27:25.750 --> 00:27:28.370 align:middle line:84%
and honing these techniques
so that we can do these things

00:27:28.370 --> 00:27:29.170 align:middle line:90%
in our living room.

00:27:29.170 --> 00:27:32.350 align:middle line:84%
So we don't have to go to a
monastery on a mountain top

00:27:32.350 --> 00:27:35.560 align:middle line:84%
at high elevation half
a world away to do it.

00:27:35.560 --> 00:27:41.170 align:middle line:84%
One of the techniques I offered
was to feel the feeling--

00:27:41.170 --> 00:27:45.950 align:middle line:84%
one of four feelings-- to create
that 0.1 hertz, gratitude,

00:27:45.950 --> 00:27:50.090 align:middle line:84%
appreciation, care,
or compassion.

00:27:50.090 --> 00:27:51.580 align:middle line:90%
Compassion is the key.

00:27:51.580 --> 00:27:54.640 align:middle line:84%
Compassion is one of the
doorways to the gamma brain

00:27:54.640 --> 00:27:55.630 align:middle line:90%
state.

00:27:55.630 --> 00:27:58.160 align:middle line:90%
When we are in compassion--

00:27:58.160 --> 00:27:59.680 align:middle line:90%
now it makes perfect sense--

00:27:59.680 --> 00:28:01.430 align:middle line:84%
when we're in this
state of compassion,

00:28:01.430 --> 00:28:04.020 align:middle line:84%
now that we know it's
this sweeping wave,

00:28:04.020 --> 00:28:07.300 align:middle line:84%
the state of compassion
opens this realm

00:28:07.300 --> 00:28:10.230 align:middle line:84%
of possibilities to the way
that we think and we feel.

00:28:10.230 --> 00:28:12.370 align:middle line:84%
And I just want to talk
to you briefly about

00:28:12.370 --> 00:28:15.310 align:middle line:90%
how we access compassion.

00:28:15.310 --> 00:28:21.930 align:middle line:84%
In the West, compassion is often
mistaken for a form of pity,

00:28:21.930 --> 00:28:24.540 align:middle line:84%
where we feel sorry
for another person.

00:28:24.540 --> 00:28:26.560 align:middle line:84%
Well, in its truest
sense, when I'm

00:28:26.560 --> 00:28:28.420 align:middle line:84%
working with a
monks and nuns when

00:28:28.420 --> 00:28:31.000 align:middle line:84%
we were in Tibet, through the
translators, that's not the way

00:28:31.000 --> 00:28:32.050 align:middle line:90%
they think of compassion.

00:28:32.050 --> 00:28:34.360 align:middle line:84%
So let me talk to you
about this just briefly.

00:28:34.360 --> 00:28:38.200 align:middle line:84%
Compassion is the
end of a sequence.

00:28:38.200 --> 00:28:41.080 align:middle line:90%
A sequence begins with sympathy.

00:28:41.080 --> 00:28:46.660 align:middle line:84%
When we are in sympathy, what
we're saying is that we cannot

00:28:46.660 --> 00:28:48.950 align:middle line:84%
even imagine what
someone is going through.

00:28:48.950 --> 00:28:51.130 align:middle line:84%
But we can sympathize
with their hurt

00:28:51.130 --> 00:28:52.700 align:middle line:90%
or sympathize with their pain.

00:28:52.700 --> 00:28:53.700 align:middle line:90%
You get a sympathy card.

00:28:53.700 --> 00:28:54.370 align:middle line:90%
That's what it says.

00:28:54.370 --> 00:28:56.245 align:middle line:84%
I can only imagine what
you're going through.

00:28:56.245 --> 00:28:57.560 align:middle line:90%
And this is very honest.

00:28:57.560 --> 00:29:00.250 align:middle line:84%
So in sympathy, we
are not experiencing

00:29:00.250 --> 00:29:02.560 align:middle line:84%
the hurt or the pain,
but we're acknowledging

00:29:02.560 --> 00:29:04.347 align:middle line:84%
that hurt her pain
in another person.

00:29:04.347 --> 00:29:05.180 align:middle line:90%
It's the first step.

00:29:05.180 --> 00:29:08.440 align:middle line:84%
The next step from
sympathy is empathy.

00:29:08.440 --> 00:29:12.250 align:middle line:84%
In empathy, we are
actually feeling

00:29:12.250 --> 00:29:14.337 align:middle line:90%
the pain of another person.

00:29:14.337 --> 00:29:15.670 align:middle line:90%
Health care providers know this.

00:29:15.670 --> 00:29:17.860 align:middle line:84%
When you work in an
office as a doctor,

00:29:17.860 --> 00:29:21.280 align:middle line:84%
or a nurse, a practitioner,
a body worker, a massage

00:29:21.280 --> 00:29:26.380 align:middle line:84%
therapist, counselor,
relationship therapist,

00:29:26.380 --> 00:29:28.690 align:middle line:84%
physical therapy,
anything like that,

00:29:28.690 --> 00:29:30.910 align:middle line:84%
you automatically
empathize with the people

00:29:30.910 --> 00:29:33.100 align:middle line:84%
that you're with to
better serve them.

00:29:33.100 --> 00:29:36.280 align:middle line:84%
At the end of the day, if
you've seen 10, 12, 15 people,

00:29:36.280 --> 00:29:38.000 align:middle line:90%
they go home feeling better.

00:29:38.000 --> 00:29:41.620 align:middle line:84%
And if you have not yet learned
how to separate yourself

00:29:41.620 --> 00:29:44.037 align:middle line:84%
from your empathy, you go
home feeling maybe worse thing

00:29:44.037 --> 00:29:46.120 align:middle line:84%
than you did when you came
to work in the morning.

00:29:46.120 --> 00:29:47.662 align:middle line:84%
Because you're
empathizing with them.

00:29:47.662 --> 00:29:49.720 align:middle line:84%
The brain scans
actually show that, when

00:29:49.720 --> 00:29:51.730 align:middle line:84%
we empathize with
someone's pain,

00:29:51.730 --> 00:29:55.030 align:middle line:84%
the pain centers in
the brain of the person

00:29:55.030 --> 00:29:57.790 align:middle line:84%
empathizing light up
in the same places

00:29:57.790 --> 00:30:00.460 align:middle line:84%
but not to the same
degree as they light up

00:30:00.460 --> 00:30:02.590 align:middle line:90%
in the person having the hurt.

00:30:02.590 --> 00:30:03.610 align:middle line:90%
So we experience.

00:30:03.610 --> 00:30:08.740 align:middle line:84%
We say, in empathy, I can
empathize with your pain.

00:30:08.740 --> 00:30:12.110 align:middle line:84%
I am experiencing that pain, the
pain of the loss of a loved one

00:30:12.110 --> 00:30:15.160 align:middle line:84%
or whatever that is-- the
second step to compassion.

00:30:15.160 --> 00:30:17.240 align:middle line:90%
The third step is compassion.

00:30:17.240 --> 00:30:20.380 align:middle line:84%
Compassion is a
step beyond empathy.

00:30:20.380 --> 00:30:23.460 align:middle line:84%
Now I want to talk about
compassion just for a minute

00:30:23.460 --> 00:30:26.800 align:middle line:84%
and define it in a maybe a
little bit different way.

00:30:26.800 --> 00:30:31.630 align:middle line:84%
Compassion is defined as an
emotional experience where we,

00:30:31.630 --> 00:30:35.420 align:middle line:84%
first, accept the suffering
of another without judgment--

00:30:35.420 --> 00:30:37.510 align:middle line:84%
this is a very
Buddhist concept--

00:30:37.510 --> 00:30:41.763 align:middle line:84%
without judgment and without
attachment to the outcome,

00:30:41.763 --> 00:30:43.930 align:middle line:84%
to the rightness, or the
wrongness, or the goodness,

00:30:43.930 --> 00:30:45.550 align:middle line:90%
or the badness.

00:30:45.550 --> 00:30:48.220 align:middle line:84%
This is what gives
compassion so much power.

00:30:48.220 --> 00:30:52.570 align:middle line:84%
And a gamma brain state,
this sweeping wave,

00:30:52.570 --> 00:30:55.360 align:middle line:84%
it is sweeping all
the lobes of the brain

00:30:55.360 --> 00:30:57.850 align:middle line:90%
so that we are not anchored.

00:30:57.850 --> 00:31:00.010 align:middle line:84%
We're not stuck in the
rightness or the wrongness

00:31:00.010 --> 00:31:01.720 align:middle line:90%
of what we're seeing.

00:31:01.720 --> 00:31:05.560 align:middle line:84%
So compassion, we accept the
suffering without judgment.

00:31:05.560 --> 00:31:08.530 align:middle line:84%
We accept it without
attachment to the outcome.

00:31:08.530 --> 00:31:11.530 align:middle line:84%
The third piece here
is, at the same time,

00:31:11.530 --> 00:31:15.670 align:middle line:84%
we hold the focus for a greater
possibility or a greater

00:31:15.670 --> 00:31:16.683 align:middle line:90%
outcome.

00:31:16.683 --> 00:31:18.100 align:middle line:84%
So we acknowledge
what's happening

00:31:18.100 --> 00:31:21.250 align:middle line:84%
without the judgment of
what's happening while holding

00:31:21.250 --> 00:31:24.530 align:middle line:90%
a space for a greater outcome.

00:31:24.530 --> 00:31:25.645 align:middle line:90%
So there's a lot in there.

00:31:25.645 --> 00:31:26.710 align:middle line:90%
There's a lot to think about.

00:31:26.710 --> 00:31:28.918 align:middle line:84%
And for some people, I know
it's a very different way

00:31:28.918 --> 00:31:30.130 align:middle line:90%
of thinking about compassion.

00:31:30.130 --> 00:31:32.050 align:middle line:84%
This is the way
the Buddhist monks

00:31:32.050 --> 00:31:34.870 align:middle line:90%
in Tibet define compassion.

00:31:34.870 --> 00:31:36.220 align:middle line:90%
And it makes perfect sense.

00:31:36.220 --> 00:31:38.380 align:middle line:84%
Because when we are able
to do these things--

00:31:38.380 --> 00:31:39.220 align:middle line:90%
think about this.

00:31:39.220 --> 00:31:41.908 align:middle line:84%
When you're able to acknowledge
what's happening without

00:31:41.908 --> 00:31:43.450 align:middle line:84%
the attachment-- so
the attachment is

00:31:43.450 --> 00:31:44.637 align:middle line:90%
the polarization--

00:31:44.637 --> 00:31:46.970 align:middle line:84%
without the judgment of the
rightness, or the wrongness,

00:31:46.970 --> 00:31:49.345 align:middle line:84%
or the goodness or
the badness, then you

00:31:49.345 --> 00:31:50.470 align:middle line:90%
are not in your left brain.

00:31:50.470 --> 00:31:52.000 align:middle line:90%
You're not in your right brain.

00:31:52.000 --> 00:31:55.360 align:middle line:84%
You are able to move
into something beyond,

00:31:55.360 --> 00:31:57.548 align:middle line:90%
to transcend the judgment.

00:31:57.548 --> 00:31:59.590 align:middle line:84%
And this is where the
gamma brain state comes in.

00:31:59.590 --> 00:32:02.380 align:middle line:84%
Compassion is the key to
the game of brain state.

00:32:02.380 --> 00:32:06.280 align:middle line:84%
Compassion is the ancient
science that leads us directly

00:32:06.280 --> 00:32:07.804 align:middle line:90%
into that gamma brain state.

00:32:07.804 --> 00:32:09.500 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:32:09.500 --> 00:32:11.680 align:middle line:84%
So I'm going to offer
you a little formula

00:32:11.680 --> 00:32:14.350 align:middle line:84%
that you can think of
and carry in your lives

00:32:14.350 --> 00:32:17.900 align:middle line:84%
when you want to optimize your
opportunity for your greatest

00:32:17.900 --> 00:32:18.700 align:middle line:90%
potentials.

00:32:18.700 --> 00:32:20.400 align:middle line:90%
The formula is simply this.

00:32:20.400 --> 00:32:24.160 align:middle line:84%
Heart brain coherence
plus the gamma brain state

00:32:24.160 --> 00:32:26.620 align:middle line:90%
equals all systems go.

00:32:26.620 --> 00:32:28.720 align:middle line:84%
When you create the
heart brain coherence

00:32:28.720 --> 00:32:32.500 align:middle line:84%
and into that space of
coherence you drop the gamma

00:32:32.500 --> 00:32:35.200 align:middle line:84%
state of consciousness,
now you have

00:32:35.200 --> 00:32:37.360 align:middle line:90%
become a very different person.

00:32:37.360 --> 00:32:40.300 align:middle line:84%
You have transcended the
judgments of your peers,

00:32:40.300 --> 00:32:43.090 align:middle line:84%
of your society, of your
culture, of your family.

00:32:43.090 --> 00:32:46.690 align:middle line:84%
And you are opening the
door to a deep, deep, deep

00:32:46.690 --> 00:32:50.770 align:middle line:84%
communication with the field
of energy, the divine matrix.

00:32:50.770 --> 00:32:53.680 align:middle line:84%
And that is where
your mastery begins.

00:32:53.680 --> 00:32:57.790 align:middle line:84%
So it's from this place
of extraordinary abilities

00:32:57.790 --> 00:33:01.540 align:middle line:84%
that we actually learn
to hack the matrix.

00:33:01.540 --> 00:33:03.460 align:middle line:84%
We learn to hack
the matrix as we

00:33:03.460 --> 00:33:07.913 align:middle line:84%
are no longer subject
to the laws of physics

00:33:07.913 --> 00:33:08.830 align:middle line:90%
as we know them today.

00:33:08.830 --> 00:33:12.370 align:middle line:84%
We're no longer confined to
the limits of space and time.

00:33:12.370 --> 00:33:17.050 align:middle line:84%
It's from this place where
we create the prayers that

00:33:17.050 --> 00:33:19.360 align:middle line:84%
influence the
healing of our bodies

00:33:19.360 --> 00:33:22.270 align:middle line:84%
in a very powerful, very
profound way, as well

00:33:22.270 --> 00:33:24.280 align:middle line:90%
is the world beyond our bodies.

00:33:24.280 --> 00:33:25.970 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:33:25.970 --> 00:33:28.580 align:middle line:84%
Through embracing the deepest
truths of our relationship

00:33:28.580 --> 00:33:31.550 align:middle line:84%
to the divine matrix,
we are given the key

00:33:31.550 --> 00:33:34.550 align:middle line:84%
to transcend the rules
of physics, and time,

00:33:34.550 --> 00:33:37.340 align:middle line:84%
and space that seemed to
limit us in this world.

00:33:37.340 --> 00:33:40.490 align:middle line:84%
In doing so, we truly
have the divine matrix

00:33:40.490 --> 00:33:43.390 align:middle line:84%
as we express our highest
levels of mastery.

00:33:43.390 --> 00:33:46.610 align:middle line:84%
In the next episode, we'll
discover the prayer code from

00:33:46.610 --> 00:33:50.990 align:middle line:84%
a 2,500-year-old text that gives
us the instructions to breathe

00:33:50.990 --> 00:33:54.020 align:middle line:84%
life into our most
heartfelt creations.

00:33:54.020 --> 00:33:56.600 align:middle line:84%
I want to thank you for
joining me for today's program.
