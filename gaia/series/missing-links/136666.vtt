00:00:25.047 --> 00:00:27.630 align:middle line:84%
>> My name's Gregg Braden, and
I'd like to welcome you to this

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:30.540 align:middle line:84%
very special presentation
of "Missing Links",

00:00:30.540 --> 00:00:34.520 align:middle line:84%
the deep truth of our origin
history, destiny, and fate.

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:37.590 align:middle line:84%
In the last episode, I
shared the new evidence

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:40.920 align:middle line:84%
that is absolutely shaking the
foundation of modern science

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:44.000 align:middle line:84%
when it comes to the story
of human evolution, us

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:45.570 align:middle line:90%
and where we come from.

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:47.880 align:middle line:84%
Advanced CSI-like
technology is now

00:00:47.880 --> 00:00:51.150 align:middle line:84%
revealing DNA
evidence in our time

00:00:51.150 --> 00:00:55.050 align:middle line:84%
that Charles Darwin simply
could not have known in his.

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:58.260 align:middle line:84%
The DNA that was supposed
to represent our ancestors

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:00.000 align:middle line:90%
is now telling us a story--

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.340 align:middle line:84%
it's our story--
and the story is

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:06.060 align:middle line:84%
that we are not the product
of the long, slow process

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:08.955 align:middle line:84%
of evolution that we see
for other forms of life.

00:01:08.955 --> 00:01:10.080 align:middle line:90%
So I want to be very clear.

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:13.320 align:middle line:84%
DNA is telling us that
evolution is a fact.

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:14.400 align:middle line:90%
It's just not our story.

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:17.250 align:middle line:84%
The DNA is also telling
us that we did not

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:21.810 align:middle line:84%
descend from primitive beings
such as ancient Neanderthals.

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:25.920 align:middle line:84%
The DNA is telling us that
we appeared on this earth

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:28.680 align:middle line:84%
suddenly, in evolutionary
terms, as what

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:33.050 align:middle line:84%
are called now anatomically
modern humans, AMH.

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:35.670 align:middle line:84%
We appeared about
200,000 years ago,

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:39.150 align:middle line:84%
and the thing is we haven't
changed since we appeared.

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:41.790 align:middle line:84%
So now that we
know what we're not

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:44.160 align:middle line:84%
and we know how
quickly we did appear,

00:01:44.160 --> 00:01:47.500 align:middle line:84%
the questions that come
to mind are why and how.

00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:49.430 align:middle line:90%
Why did we suddenly appear?

00:01:49.430 --> 00:01:52.110 align:middle line:84%
Why did we show up on this
earth 200,000 years ago,

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:53.610 align:middle line:90%
and how did it happen?

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:55.860 align:middle line:84%
Well, that's what this
episode is all about.

00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:58.560 align:middle line:84%
In this episode, we'll
answer these questions.

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:01.080 align:middle line:84%
And in doing so, we're
going to open the door

00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:03.600 align:middle line:90%
to an even deeper mystery.

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:05.370 align:middle line:84%
Because the answer
to the mystery

00:02:05.370 --> 00:02:09.590 align:middle line:90%
begins in our chromosomes.

00:02:09.590 --> 00:02:12.710 align:middle line:84%
So one of the mysteries
when it comes to our origin

00:02:12.710 --> 00:02:16.730 align:middle line:84%
has always been our DNA,
specifically the way

00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:20.090 align:middle line:84%
that our DNA compares to our
nearest primate neighbors,

00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:22.580 align:middle line:90%
the great apes and chimpanzees.

00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:24.830 align:middle line:84%
And part of that
mystery is simply

00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:27.950 align:middle line:84%
in the sheer number of
chromosomes that we have.

00:02:27.950 --> 00:02:30.110 align:middle line:90%
Humans have 46 chromosomes.

00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:31.255 align:middle line:90%
The apes have 48.

00:02:31.255 --> 00:02:32.630 align:middle line:84%
And the question
has always been,

00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:34.310 align:middle line:90%
why do they have more than us?

00:02:34.310 --> 00:02:38.210 align:middle line:84%
Why do they appear to have two
more chromosomes than we do?

00:02:38.210 --> 00:02:41.360 align:middle line:84%
Well, it was only with
advances in genetic research

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:46.010 align:middle line:84%
relatively recently that
the answer to this mystery

00:02:46.010 --> 00:02:47.390 align:middle line:90%
has been determined.

00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:49.090 align:middle line:90%
The mystery has been solved.

00:02:49.090 --> 00:02:51.770 align:middle line:84%
But in solving the mystery,
it's opened the door

00:02:51.770 --> 00:02:53.360 align:middle line:84%
to an even deeper
mystery, and this

00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:55.640 align:middle line:84%
is something that
happens over and over

00:02:55.640 --> 00:02:58.760 align:middle line:84%
and over again in this
study of our origin.

00:02:58.760 --> 00:03:01.430 align:middle line:10%
So when we look at the
genome for the primates,

00:03:01.430 --> 00:03:05.360 align:middle line:10%
when we look at their 48
chromosomes, what we find

00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:10.250 align:middle line:10%
is that there is a place,
chromosome number 2, where they

00:03:10.250 --> 00:03:13.100 align:middle line:10%
have two separate chromosomes.

00:03:13.100 --> 00:03:15.200 align:middle line:10%
And only recently
have scientists

00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:20.360 align:middle line:10%
found that in the human genome,
our human chromosome number 2

00:03:20.360 --> 00:03:26.690 align:middle line:10%
is actually made of a very
specific, very precise union

00:03:26.690 --> 00:03:29.090 align:middle line:10%
of those two
primate chromosomes.

00:03:29.090 --> 00:03:30.840 align:middle line:90%
Let me say that again.

00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:33.140 align:middle line:84%
The mystery as to
why we seem to have

00:03:33.140 --> 00:03:35.780 align:middle line:84%
fewer chromosomes
than other primates

00:03:35.780 --> 00:03:39.170 align:middle line:84%
is because there are
two of theirs that

00:03:39.170 --> 00:03:43.610 align:middle line:90%
were fused into one of ours.

00:03:43.610 --> 00:03:47.210 align:middle line:84%
And that brings us to the
mystery of that chromosome--

00:03:47.210 --> 00:03:49.580 align:middle line:84%
why it was fused,
how it was fused,

00:03:49.580 --> 00:03:50.780 align:middle line:90%
what the fusion looks like.

00:03:50.780 --> 00:03:54.200 align:middle line:84%
It's all about human
chromosome number 2.

00:03:54.200 --> 00:03:55.820 align:middle line:84%
Human chromosome
number 2 has always

00:03:55.820 --> 00:03:58.040 align:middle line:90%
been fascinating to scientists.

00:03:58.040 --> 00:04:00.360 align:middle line:84%
It is one of the largest
chromosomes in the human body.

00:04:00.360 --> 00:04:05.190 align:middle line:84%
It makes about 8% of the DNA
in every cell in our body.

00:04:05.190 --> 00:04:09.050 align:middle line:84%
And the way that this
chromosome has formed

00:04:09.050 --> 00:04:12.440 align:middle line:84%
is very controversial
right now, so much so

00:04:12.440 --> 00:04:14.390 align:middle line:84%
that it was the subject
of an entire study.

00:04:14.390 --> 00:04:16.700 align:middle line:84%
It has been the subject
of entire conferences

00:04:16.700 --> 00:04:20.899 align:middle line:84%
that last a week and longer
on human chromosome number 2.

00:04:20.899 --> 00:04:23.090 align:middle line:84%
But what I'd like
to do right now,

00:04:23.090 --> 00:04:26.080 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to begin with
a technical paper that

00:04:26.080 --> 00:04:26.880 align:middle line:90%
was published.

00:04:26.880 --> 00:04:29.220 align:middle line:84%
So this is peer
reviewed science.

00:04:29.220 --> 00:04:30.020 align:middle line:90%
This isn't theory.

00:04:30.020 --> 00:04:32.150 align:middle line:90%
It's not hypothesis.

00:04:32.150 --> 00:04:36.020 align:middle line:84%
It is peer reviewed science
that now is telling us

00:04:36.020 --> 00:04:41.457 align:middle line:84%
precisely how these two
primate chromosomes were

00:04:41.457 --> 00:04:44.810 align:middle line:84%
fused to give us the
one chromosome that

00:04:44.810 --> 00:04:45.750 align:middle line:90%
makes us unique.

00:04:45.750 --> 00:04:46.850 align:middle line:90%
It makes us who we are.

00:04:46.850 --> 00:04:49.970 align:middle line:84%
It gives us the abilities that
we have that sets us apart

00:04:49.970 --> 00:04:50.930 align:middle line:90%
from all other life.

00:04:50.930 --> 00:04:53.150 align:middle line:84%
And I think because
of that, it's

00:04:53.150 --> 00:04:55.550 align:middle line:84%
worth taking a deeper
look at this chromosome.

00:04:55.550 --> 00:04:57.890 align:middle line:84%
So I'm going to
read to you directly

00:04:57.890 --> 00:05:01.160 align:middle line:84%
from a technical research
paper, the "National

00:05:01.160 --> 00:05:03.680 align:middle line:84%
Academy of Sciences"--
proceedings of the "National

00:05:03.680 --> 00:05:05.060 align:middle line:90%
Academy of Sciences."

00:05:05.060 --> 00:05:08.930 align:middle line:84%
Let me read what they say in
their language, and then let's

00:05:08.930 --> 00:05:10.610 align:middle line:84%
you and I talk about
what that means.

00:05:10.610 --> 00:05:12.530 align:middle line:84%
And we'll use some
graphics to help break this

00:05:12.530 --> 00:05:14.060 align:middle line:90%
down a little bit.

00:05:14.060 --> 00:05:17.000 align:middle line:10%
In the proceedings from the
"National Academy of Sciences"

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:20.780 align:middle line:10%
in the journal that
is titled "Genetics",

00:05:20.780 --> 00:05:22.850 align:middle line:10%
the subtitle tells
the whole story.

00:05:22.850 --> 00:05:24.920 align:middle line:84%
The "Origin of
human chromosome 2:

00:05:24.920 --> 00:05:30.050 align:middle line:84%
An ancestral
telomere-telomere fusion."

00:05:30.050 --> 00:05:31.520 align:middle line:10%
So before we go
any further, I want

00:05:31.520 --> 00:05:36.110 align:middle line:10%
to talk to you about
what a telomere is.

00:05:36.110 --> 00:05:39.314 align:middle line:84%
When we look at the ends
of a human chromosome,

00:05:39.314 --> 00:05:40.730 align:middle line:84%
what we see is the
chromosome that

00:05:40.730 --> 00:05:45.260 align:middle line:84%
looks essentially like a little
X. And within that X, the DNA--

00:05:45.260 --> 00:05:47.150 align:middle line:84%
the strands of the
DNA, the double helix--

00:05:47.150 --> 00:05:49.040 align:middle line:90%
are within that X. All right?

00:05:49.040 --> 00:05:53.320 align:middle line:84%
At the end of each
strand of chromosome,

00:05:53.320 --> 00:05:56.960 align:middle line:84%
there's a very
special kind of DNA.

00:05:56.960 --> 00:06:00.140 align:middle line:84%
It is a repeating
sequence, the same sequence

00:06:00.140 --> 00:06:02.670 align:middle line:90%
over and over and over again.

00:06:02.670 --> 00:06:04.594 align:middle line:84%
And this sequence is
called a telomere.

00:06:04.594 --> 00:06:06.260 align:middle line:84%
And we're going to
talk a lot about this

00:06:06.260 --> 00:06:07.809 align:middle line:90%
later in this episode.

00:06:07.809 --> 00:06:09.350 align:middle line:84%
But what I want you
to know right now

00:06:09.350 --> 00:06:10.820 align:middle line:90%
is that those telomeres--

00:06:10.820 --> 00:06:13.920 align:middle line:84%
at the end of each
repeating sequence,

00:06:13.920 --> 00:06:16.490 align:middle line:84%
they are the key to what
the scientists found

00:06:16.490 --> 00:06:20.000 align:middle line:84%
about the fusion of the primate
chromosomes that give us

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:22.430 align:middle line:84%
our chromosome 2,
that makes us unique,

00:06:22.430 --> 00:06:26.270 align:middle line:84%
because the fusion happened
at the end of those two

00:06:26.270 --> 00:06:27.580 align:middle line:90%
telomere sequences.

00:06:27.580 --> 00:06:28.580 align:middle line:10%
So I'm going to go back.

00:06:28.580 --> 00:06:31.270 align:middle line:10%
I'm going to read precisely
what this paper is saying,

00:06:31.270 --> 00:06:33.170 align:middle line:10%
and then we're going
to break this down.

00:06:33.170 --> 00:06:35.176 align:middle line:10%
I'm going to cut to
the chase, once again,

00:06:35.176 --> 00:06:37.800 align:middle line:10%
because I don't think we want to
read through the entire paper.

00:06:37.800 --> 00:06:41.420 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to go to the last
sentence of the conclusion

00:06:41.420 --> 00:06:44.660 align:middle line:84%
of the study from the "Origin
of human chromosome number 2"

00:06:44.660 --> 00:06:50.300 align:middle line:84%
And it says that "we conclude
that human chromosome number 2

00:06:50.300 --> 00:06:55.710 align:middle line:84%
is the relic of an ancient
telomere-telomere fusion."

00:06:55.710 --> 00:06:56.510 align:middle line:90%
All right?

00:06:56.510 --> 00:06:58.530 align:middle line:10%
And the paper goes on to say--

00:06:58.530 --> 00:07:00.650 align:middle line:10%
and this is what's
really important here--

00:07:00.650 --> 00:07:02.750 align:middle line:10%
not only did the fusion
happen, the paper says,

00:07:02.750 --> 00:07:06.950 align:middle line:10%
"this fusion must
have been followed

00:07:06.950 --> 00:07:10.560 align:middle line:10%
by the elimination of
overlapping functions

00:07:10.560 --> 00:07:14.070 align:middle line:10%
as well as by events that
stabilize the fusion."

00:07:14.070 --> 00:07:15.980 align:middle line:10%
Now, what are they saying here?

00:07:15.980 --> 00:07:17.920 align:middle line:84%
Well, it's telling
us two things.

00:07:17.920 --> 00:07:21.780 align:middle line:84%
First of all, they're telling
us that the second largest

00:07:21.780 --> 00:07:25.530 align:middle line:84%
chromosome in our body is
the chromosome that makes us

00:07:25.530 --> 00:07:29.880 align:middle line:84%
unique, that gives us the
advanced abilities that we have

00:07:29.880 --> 00:07:33.300 align:middle line:84%
that no other form of life
has-- things like intuition

00:07:33.300 --> 00:07:37.170 align:middle line:84%
and things like logic, all
of those kinds of things--

00:07:37.170 --> 00:07:41.050 align:middle line:84%
that chromosome is the
result of an ancient fusion.

00:07:41.050 --> 00:07:41.850 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:07:41.850 --> 00:07:43.860 align:middle line:84%
So that's the first
thing it's telling us--

00:07:43.860 --> 00:07:46.020 align:middle line:84%
that somehow through
a mechanism that

00:07:46.020 --> 00:07:50.400 align:middle line:84%
is not completely understood,
the primate, the great ape

00:07:50.400 --> 00:07:53.580 align:middle line:84%
chromosomes were fused to
make us who we are today.

00:07:53.580 --> 00:07:57.180 align:middle line:84%
Number one-- this is where
it gets really interesting.

00:07:57.180 --> 00:08:00.300 align:middle line:84%
Because they say that
the fusion that happen

00:08:00.300 --> 00:08:02.610 align:middle line:84%
could not happen under
natural conditions,

00:08:02.610 --> 00:08:04.830 align:middle line:84%
at least as we know
those conditions today.

00:08:04.830 --> 00:08:07.570 align:middle line:84%
This isn't something that
you see happen all the time.

00:08:07.570 --> 00:08:09.030 align:middle line:90%
And here's the reason why--

00:08:09.030 --> 00:08:13.470 align:middle line:84%
not only did the fusion occur,
the telomere-telomere fusion.

00:08:13.470 --> 00:08:17.110 align:middle line:84%
After it happened,
the redundant,

00:08:17.110 --> 00:08:20.650 align:middle line:84%
the overlapping portions
from the two chromosomes,

00:08:20.650 --> 00:08:23.740 align:middle line:84%
were removed so that
the chromosome became

00:08:23.740 --> 00:08:26.260 align:middle line:90%
efficient and very stable.

00:08:26.260 --> 00:08:27.670 align:middle line:90%
And that is something.

00:08:27.670 --> 00:08:30.400 align:middle line:84%
The precision and the timing
with which that happened

00:08:30.400 --> 00:08:33.052 align:middle line:84%
is where the mystery
really unfolds.

00:08:33.052 --> 00:08:34.510 align:middle line:84%
So let's take a
look at this again.

00:08:34.510 --> 00:08:37.220 align:middle line:84%
I want to show this to you
graphically so in your mind

00:08:37.220 --> 00:08:38.020 align:middle line:90%
you have a sense.

00:08:38.020 --> 00:08:41.500 align:middle line:84%
If you look at your screen,
let's go through this breakdown

00:08:41.500 --> 00:08:43.990 align:middle line:84%
how the chromosomes
actually came apart,

00:08:43.990 --> 00:08:48.080 align:middle line:84%
how they came back together,
and what that means to us today.

00:08:48.080 --> 00:08:51.010 align:middle line:84%
What you're seeing on the screen
is a graphic representation.

00:08:51.010 --> 00:08:53.060 align:middle line:84%
These are two
separate chromosomes.

00:08:53.060 --> 00:08:56.080 align:middle line:84%
So these were two
chromosomes already existing

00:08:56.080 --> 00:09:00.130 align:middle line:84%
in the primate genome, in the
great apes and the chimpanzees.

00:09:00.130 --> 00:09:03.820 align:middle line:84%
We're seeing a dotted line
across those chromosomes.

00:09:03.820 --> 00:09:05.620 align:middle line:84%
For a reason that we
don't understand--

00:09:05.620 --> 00:09:08.200 align:middle line:84%
we're not sure what
happened-- there was a break,

00:09:08.200 --> 00:09:13.570 align:middle line:84%
something broke or cut or
sliced those chromosomes.

00:09:13.570 --> 00:09:17.020 align:middle line:84%
And they were broken in
the way that you're seeing

00:09:17.020 --> 00:09:19.090 align:middle line:90%
on your screen right now.

00:09:19.090 --> 00:09:21.220 align:middle line:90%
Portions of those were deleted.

00:09:21.220 --> 00:09:23.200 align:middle line:84%
That material--
the longer portions

00:09:23.200 --> 00:09:26.260 align:middle line:84%
on the lower part of the graph,
the lower part of the chart--

00:09:26.260 --> 00:09:27.790 align:middle line:90%
it disappeared.

00:09:27.790 --> 00:09:30.700 align:middle line:84%
So that material
no longer exists.

00:09:30.700 --> 00:09:36.640 align:middle line:84%
Above the two portions
that you see are now free

00:09:36.640 --> 00:09:40.330 align:middle line:84%
actually came together
and fused at the ends,

00:09:40.330 --> 00:09:43.210 align:middle line:84%
as you're seeing on
your screen right now.

00:09:43.210 --> 00:09:47.430 align:middle line:84%
And that fusion created the
longer human chromosome number

00:09:47.430 --> 00:09:48.230 align:middle line:90%
2.

00:09:48.230 --> 00:09:50.620 align:middle line:84%
It makes 8% of the
DNA, as I mentioned,

00:09:50.620 --> 00:09:53.080 align:middle line:90%
in every cell in our body.

00:09:53.080 --> 00:09:55.630 align:middle line:84%
However, that's not
the end of the story

00:09:55.630 --> 00:09:59.380 align:middle line:84%
because after the fusion
happened, as you can imagine,

00:09:59.380 --> 00:10:03.160 align:middle line:84%
each of those chromosomes
was independent unto itself

00:10:03.160 --> 00:10:04.600 align:middle line:90%
before the fusion.

00:10:04.600 --> 00:10:09.370 align:middle line:84%
So each of those chromosomes
had information to help it

00:10:09.370 --> 00:10:10.780 align:middle line:90%
function in the way that it did.

00:10:10.780 --> 00:10:12.400 align:middle line:90%
When they were fused--

00:10:12.400 --> 00:10:14.530 align:middle line:84%
when the two pieces
came together--

00:10:14.530 --> 00:10:17.890 align:middle line:84%
all of a sudden there
were overlapping functions

00:10:17.890 --> 00:10:20.650 align:middle line:84%
that actually would have
made human chromosome

00:10:20.650 --> 00:10:23.350 align:middle line:90%
number 2 less efficient.

00:10:23.350 --> 00:10:27.970 align:middle line:10%
And to deal with that in a way
that is not understood today,

00:10:27.970 --> 00:10:30.010 align:middle line:10%
the overlapping
functions were either

00:10:30.010 --> 00:10:33.060 align:middle line:10%
turned off within the DNA--

00:10:33.060 --> 00:10:35.020 align:middle line:10%
they shut down within
the chromosomes--

00:10:35.020 --> 00:10:37.960 align:middle line:10%
or completely
removed altogether.

00:10:37.960 --> 00:10:40.450 align:middle line:90%
That is what changes the story.

00:10:40.450 --> 00:10:43.270 align:middle line:84%
So what we're looking
at is the mystery

00:10:43.270 --> 00:10:46.570 align:middle line:84%
of an ancient
telomere-telomere fusion.

00:10:46.570 --> 00:10:52.030 align:middle line:84%
The function, the precision, the
timing with which this fusion

00:10:52.030 --> 00:10:54.790 align:middle line:84%
happened, the fact that
it happened quickly,

00:10:54.790 --> 00:10:57.040 align:middle line:84%
the fact that it
is so precise that

00:10:57.040 --> 00:10:59.950 align:middle line:84%
certain redundant
functions were removed

00:10:59.950 --> 00:11:02.800 align:middle line:84%
and portions were
deleted, it tells us

00:11:02.800 --> 00:11:05.950 align:middle line:84%
that something more than
evolution has happened here.

00:11:05.950 --> 00:11:10.390 align:middle line:84%
Evolution, as we know it today,
cannot and does not explain

00:11:10.390 --> 00:11:11.350 align:middle line:90%
this fusion.

00:11:11.350 --> 00:11:13.600 align:middle line:84%
And this fusion is
key because it's

00:11:13.600 --> 00:11:15.160 align:middle line:90%
the fusion that makes us human.

00:11:15.160 --> 00:11:18.070 align:middle line:84%
It's the fusion
that sets us apart

00:11:18.070 --> 00:11:20.710 align:middle line:90%
from all other form of life.

00:11:20.710 --> 00:11:24.370 align:middle line:84%
It appears to be
intentional, and this

00:11:24.370 --> 00:11:29.050 align:middle line:84%
is where we begin to kind of
open the door to forbidden

00:11:29.050 --> 00:11:31.240 align:middle line:90%
territory in science.

00:11:31.240 --> 00:11:33.400 align:middle line:84%
So I'm sharing with
you the science--

00:11:33.400 --> 00:11:36.040 align:middle line:84%
this is peer reviewed science
that tells us what happened.

00:11:36.040 --> 00:11:37.720 align:middle line:90%
And we've just done that.

00:11:37.720 --> 00:11:42.670 align:middle line:84%
Now there's this gray, this
shady kind of fuzzy area--

00:11:42.670 --> 00:11:44.980 align:middle line:84%
why would something
like that happen?

00:11:44.980 --> 00:11:48.280 align:middle line:84%
There appears to be an
intent underlying this,

00:11:48.280 --> 00:11:50.810 align:middle line:84%
and scientists don't
know who or how or why.

00:11:50.810 --> 00:11:52.840 align:middle line:90%
And I don't either for certain.

00:11:52.840 --> 00:11:55.120 align:middle line:84%
I have my sense, my
suspicions, but I'd

00:11:55.120 --> 00:11:58.360 align:middle line:84%
like to explore some
possibilities with you.

00:11:58.360 --> 00:12:00.250 align:middle line:84%
Because the
conventional thinking--

00:12:00.250 --> 00:12:04.930 align:middle line:84%
when we hear about the fusion of
DNA a long time ago and the way

00:12:04.930 --> 00:12:06.310 align:middle line:90%
that that happened--

00:12:06.310 --> 00:12:08.410 align:middle line:84%
we're taught to think
in binary terms.

00:12:08.410 --> 00:12:10.190 align:middle line:84%
We say, well, it's
either evolution.

00:12:10.190 --> 00:12:12.290 align:middle line:84%
And if it's not evolution,
it's creationism.

00:12:12.290 --> 00:12:13.090 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:12:13.090 --> 00:12:16.570 align:middle line:84%
Creationism invoking
religion, invoking God,

00:12:16.570 --> 00:12:19.960 align:middle line:84%
invoking a lot of things
that seem to be hot buttons

00:12:19.960 --> 00:12:22.810 align:middle line:84%
for a lot of people just
because of the implications.

00:12:22.810 --> 00:12:25.090 align:middle line:84%
And I think for
that reason-- that's

00:12:25.090 --> 00:12:28.120 align:middle line:84%
why it has become forbidden
territory in science.

00:12:28.120 --> 00:12:30.390 align:middle line:84%
Science simply cannot
prove these things.

00:12:30.390 --> 00:12:34.540 align:middle line:84%
But there's a third option, a
third option that has happened.

00:12:34.540 --> 00:12:38.590 align:middle line:84%
For the fusion to
occur the way it did,

00:12:38.590 --> 00:12:41.200 align:middle line:90%
a mutation had to occur.

00:12:41.200 --> 00:12:42.580 align:middle line:90%
That fusion is a mutation.

00:12:42.580 --> 00:12:48.670 align:middle line:84%
It means that two genes mutated
into the new human chromosome

00:12:48.670 --> 00:12:51.850 align:middle line:84%
number 2, or two
chromosomes mutated

00:12:51.850 --> 00:12:54.520 align:middle line:84%
into the new human
chromosome number 2.

00:12:54.520 --> 00:12:57.910 align:middle line:84%
Because that is a
mutation, the third option

00:12:57.910 --> 00:12:59.890 align:middle line:90%
is now recognizing that.

00:12:59.890 --> 00:13:03.970 align:middle line:84%
The third option is
called directed mutation.

00:13:03.970 --> 00:13:07.510 align:middle line:84%
Directed mutation-- it means
it didn't happen spontaneously

00:13:07.510 --> 00:13:09.370 align:middle line:90%
from a natural process.

00:13:09.370 --> 00:13:11.200 align:middle line:90%
Something directed the mutation.

00:13:11.200 --> 00:13:15.300 align:middle line:84%
We don't know what
it was for sure.

00:13:15.300 --> 00:13:18.540 align:middle line:84%
And this is opening the doors
to new possibilities in science

00:13:18.540 --> 00:13:20.640 align:middle line:90%
and in scientific thinking.

00:13:20.640 --> 00:13:24.030 align:middle line:84%
So where and how
that happened, that's

00:13:24.030 --> 00:13:26.880 align:middle line:84%
where the study is
going right now.

00:13:26.880 --> 00:13:29.520 align:middle line:84%
And what the studies
are showing us

00:13:29.520 --> 00:13:34.320 align:middle line:84%
is telling a story that,
while it's new for science,

00:13:34.320 --> 00:13:37.170 align:middle line:84%
in our most ancient and
cherished spiritual traditions

00:13:37.170 --> 00:13:38.970 align:middle line:84%
we've heard this story
in different ways

00:13:38.970 --> 00:13:40.620 align:middle line:90%
many times before.

00:13:40.620 --> 00:13:44.450 align:middle line:84%
So when we talk about
this directed mutation,

00:13:44.450 --> 00:13:48.390 align:middle line:84%
it opens the door to one of
the most controversial facets

00:13:48.390 --> 00:13:51.360 align:middle line:84%
of evolutionary
theory and the ideas

00:13:51.360 --> 00:13:53.790 align:middle line:84%
and the beliefs that
support it and do not.

00:13:53.790 --> 00:13:56.160 align:middle line:84%
That is called
intelligent design.

00:13:56.160 --> 00:13:58.860 align:middle line:84%
Intelligent design--
precisely what it says,

00:13:58.860 --> 00:14:02.940 align:middle line:84%
that there is a design
that is in place underlying

00:14:02.940 --> 00:14:04.560 align:middle line:84%
the genetic
structure of all life

00:14:04.560 --> 00:14:07.170 align:middle line:84%
and that some form
of intelligence

00:14:07.170 --> 00:14:11.490 align:middle line:90%
has been the one to direct that.

00:14:11.490 --> 00:14:13.865 align:middle line:84%
For many people, this is where
the religious implications

00:14:13.865 --> 00:14:14.665 align:middle line:90%
come in.

00:14:14.665 --> 00:14:16.400 align:middle line:84%
For me, it doesn't
have to be that way.

00:14:16.400 --> 00:14:18.040 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't have to
be about religion.

00:14:18.040 --> 00:14:19.970 align:middle line:84%
It may, but it
doesn't have to be.

00:14:19.970 --> 00:14:23.670 align:middle line:84%
But the strongest evidence,
the strongest argument,

00:14:23.670 --> 00:14:28.620 align:middle line:84%
for what is called directed
mutation and intelligent design

00:14:28.620 --> 00:14:31.140 align:middle line:84%
comes from a principle
that I alluded to

00:14:31.140 --> 00:14:33.630 align:middle line:84%
in the previous episode,
but I didn't really

00:14:33.630 --> 00:14:36.360 align:middle line:84%
explain it very much because
I knew we would here.

00:14:36.360 --> 00:14:39.480 align:middle line:84%
It's called
irreducible complexity.

00:14:39.480 --> 00:14:41.610 align:middle line:90%
Irreducible complexity.

00:14:41.610 --> 00:14:42.850 align:middle line:90%
Here's what I mean by that.

00:14:42.850 --> 00:14:45.120 align:middle line:84%
If you are walking
in a field and you

00:14:45.120 --> 00:14:50.700 align:middle line:84%
find a watch, a watch
lying on the ground,

00:14:50.700 --> 00:14:55.500 align:middle line:84%
it is a safe assumption to
make that some intelligence

00:14:55.500 --> 00:14:57.930 align:middle line:84%
underlies the creation
of that watch.

00:14:57.930 --> 00:15:01.230 align:middle line:10%
The way the gears come
together and interlock

00:15:01.230 --> 00:15:06.390 align:middle line:10%
and the way that those gears
produce a function that

00:15:06.390 --> 00:15:10.050 align:middle line:10%
is useful and
meaningful obviously

00:15:10.050 --> 00:15:13.950 align:middle line:10%
reflects some
intent, some design.

00:15:13.950 --> 00:15:16.890 align:middle line:84%
And that's very different
than if we were just

00:15:16.890 --> 00:15:19.000 align:middle line:84%
to find a rock
laying on the ground,

00:15:19.000 --> 00:15:22.350 align:middle line:84%
and we say, well, that rock may
have been put there last week.

00:15:22.350 --> 00:15:24.260 align:middle line:84%
It could have been there
for a billion years.

00:15:24.260 --> 00:15:27.690 align:middle line:84%
But it didn't necessarily take
any intention to put it there.

00:15:27.690 --> 00:15:29.880 align:middle line:84%
So I'm just using
that as an example

00:15:29.880 --> 00:15:32.160 align:middle line:90%
because scientists use--

00:15:32.160 --> 00:15:37.410 align:middle line:84%
some scientists-- are using this
idea of irreducible complexity

00:15:37.410 --> 00:15:42.120 align:middle line:84%
to validate this idea
that there is some intent

00:15:42.120 --> 00:15:44.270 align:middle line:90%
under this directed mutation.

00:15:44.270 --> 00:15:46.620 align:middle line:84%
What irreducible
complexity says to us,

00:15:46.620 --> 00:15:49.350 align:middle line:84%
it says that a
system can only work

00:15:49.350 --> 00:15:53.880 align:middle line:84%
when all the pieces are in place
to function at the same time.

00:15:53.880 --> 00:15:55.460 align:middle line:84%
So when you think
about our watch,

00:15:55.460 --> 00:15:59.580 align:middle line:84%
it wouldn't work for one
gear to show up 100 years ago

00:15:59.580 --> 00:16:02.220 align:middle line:84%
and then another gear
show up 100 years later

00:16:02.220 --> 00:16:04.212 align:middle line:84%
and then another gear
show up 100 years later.

00:16:04.212 --> 00:16:05.920 align:middle line:84%
I mean, the pieces
may not even be there,

00:16:05.920 --> 00:16:08.340 align:middle line:84%
or they may corrode over
those hundreds of years.

00:16:08.340 --> 00:16:10.380 align:middle line:84%
So you get the idea of
what I'm saying here.

00:16:10.380 --> 00:16:13.290 align:middle line:84%
All the pieces for the
watch have to be in place

00:16:13.290 --> 00:16:15.780 align:middle line:84%
and available at the
same time for that watch

00:16:15.780 --> 00:16:18.060 align:middle line:84%
to become a watch and
function as it does.

00:16:18.060 --> 00:16:22.230 align:middle line:84%
That idea, that principle,
applies to so many facets

00:16:22.230 --> 00:16:24.240 align:middle line:90%
of biological life.

00:16:24.240 --> 00:16:26.880 align:middle line:84%
It's kind of like the
idea of a mouse trap.

00:16:26.880 --> 00:16:30.780 align:middle line:84%
And this is an idea that
scientists use a lot when

00:16:30.780 --> 00:16:32.470 align:middle line:90%
they're making this argument.

00:16:32.470 --> 00:16:35.590 align:middle line:84%
If you look at a mousetrap-- and
it's a very simple mechanism.

00:16:35.590 --> 00:16:37.569 align:middle line:84%
But if any one portion
of that mousetrap

00:16:37.569 --> 00:16:39.360 align:middle line:84%
were not there in the
moment it was needed,

00:16:39.360 --> 00:16:41.070 align:middle line:84%
it wouldn't function
as a mouse trap.

00:16:41.070 --> 00:16:42.210 align:middle line:90%
You could have the base.

00:16:42.210 --> 00:16:43.920 align:middle line:84%
You could have the
cheese for the bait.

00:16:43.920 --> 00:16:45.420 align:middle line:84%
But if that spring
isn't there, it's

00:16:45.420 --> 00:16:46.620 align:middle line:90%
not going to be a mousetrap.

00:16:46.620 --> 00:16:48.840 align:middle line:84%
If you have the spring and
the cheese but no base,

00:16:48.840 --> 00:16:49.830 align:middle line:90%
there's no contraption.

00:16:49.830 --> 00:16:51.960 align:middle line:84%
There's no mechanism
for it to work.

00:16:51.960 --> 00:16:54.360 align:middle line:84%
So again, you're seeing
this idea in principle.

00:16:54.360 --> 00:16:57.860 align:middle line:84%
Let's take a look at what
it means in real life.

00:16:57.860 --> 00:17:00.180 align:middle line:84%
And this is so amazing
when you really begin

00:17:00.180 --> 00:17:01.860 align:middle line:90%
to think about these things.

00:17:01.860 --> 00:17:04.260 align:middle line:90%
I mentioned the cells earlier.

00:17:04.260 --> 00:17:06.750 align:middle line:90%
Our cells are so complex.

00:17:06.750 --> 00:17:09.900 align:middle line:84%
Back in the early
1900s, cells were

00:17:09.900 --> 00:17:14.430 align:middle line:84%
thought of as little bags,
literally little sacks of fluid

00:17:14.430 --> 00:17:16.410 align:middle line:90%
and some sticky gooey stuff.

00:17:16.410 --> 00:17:21.900 align:middle line:84%
Science had no idea of literally
the hundreds of thousands

00:17:21.900 --> 00:17:24.240 align:middle line:84%
of mechanisms that
have to be working

00:17:24.240 --> 00:17:27.250 align:middle line:84%
in place in the cell
at the same time,

00:17:27.250 --> 00:17:30.120 align:middle line:84%
such as a cell has to be
able to nourish itself.

00:17:30.120 --> 00:17:33.450 align:middle line:84%
So the cell has to be
able to take in food,

00:17:33.450 --> 00:17:37.230 align:middle line:84%
process that food in the way
that is meaningful to the cell,

00:17:37.230 --> 00:17:39.090 align:middle line:84%
and then distribute
that beyond the cell

00:17:39.090 --> 00:17:40.780 align:middle line:90%
to the rest of the body.

00:17:40.780 --> 00:17:42.870 align:middle line:84%
If you're taking in
that food, then somehow

00:17:42.870 --> 00:17:44.440 align:middle line:90%
you have to eliminate that food.

00:17:44.440 --> 00:17:46.215 align:middle line:84%
So the elimination
system has to be there

00:17:46.215 --> 00:17:48.430 align:middle line:84%
or the cell won't
live very long.

00:17:48.430 --> 00:17:50.900 align:middle line:84%
So if the elimination
system were there first

00:17:50.900 --> 00:17:53.429 align:middle line:84%
and the cell were not taking
in food, that wouldn't work.

00:17:53.429 --> 00:17:55.470 align:middle line:84%
If the food was coming in
no way to eliminate it,

00:17:55.470 --> 00:17:56.400 align:middle line:90%
that wouldn't work.

00:17:56.400 --> 00:17:59.970 align:middle line:84%
If the cell could not
reproduce itself in some way

00:17:59.970 --> 00:18:02.070 align:middle line:84%
to create another
and another cell

00:18:02.070 --> 00:18:05.130 align:middle line:84%
or if the cell could not
repair and heal itself

00:18:05.130 --> 00:18:07.440 align:middle line:84%
in one way or another,
then the cell's life

00:18:07.440 --> 00:18:08.580 align:middle line:90%
wouldn't last very long.

00:18:08.580 --> 00:18:11.340 align:middle line:84%
All of these things
had to be in place

00:18:11.340 --> 00:18:13.560 align:middle line:84%
at precisely the same
time for the cell

00:18:13.560 --> 00:18:15.720 align:middle line:90%
to work the way it works.

00:18:15.720 --> 00:18:17.850 align:middle line:84%
Another place where
we see this is

00:18:17.850 --> 00:18:21.270 align:middle line:84%
with the function of human
blood, in the hemoglobins.

00:18:21.270 --> 00:18:26.730 align:middle line:84%
There are 20 proteins that have
to be in place simultaneously

00:18:26.730 --> 00:18:29.394 align:middle line:84%
for the clotting of
blood in our bodies.

00:18:29.394 --> 00:18:31.310 align:middle line:84%
And I want you to think
about what this means.

00:18:31.310 --> 00:18:33.690 align:middle line:84%
20 proteins-- they
have to be there.

00:18:33.690 --> 00:18:36.910 align:middle line:84%
If they were not there
with the first organism,

00:18:36.910 --> 00:18:39.915 align:middle line:84%
the first time that organism
received a cut or a scratch

00:18:39.915 --> 00:18:43.020 align:middle line:84%
that we take for granted
is going to heal quickly--

00:18:43.020 --> 00:18:46.644 align:middle line:84%
if those 20 proteins were
not already in place,

00:18:46.644 --> 00:18:48.060 align:middle line:84%
then the clotting
couldn't happen.

00:18:48.060 --> 00:18:50.430 align:middle line:84%
And that organism would
bleed and bleed and bleed

00:18:50.430 --> 00:18:54.750 align:middle line:84%
until it bled out,
until it died.

00:18:54.750 --> 00:18:56.820 align:middle line:84%
If even one of those
proteins is missing,

00:18:56.820 --> 00:18:59.064 align:middle line:84%
the clotting mechanism
doesn't work.

00:18:59.064 --> 00:19:00.480 align:middle line:84%
And another place--
I'm just going

00:19:00.480 --> 00:19:03.750 align:middle line:84%
to give you another example so
you see these aren't anomalies.

00:19:03.750 --> 00:19:06.600 align:middle line:84%
The cilia-- cilia are
the little wavy tails

00:19:06.600 --> 00:19:09.120 align:middle line:84%
that we see on the ends
of some kinds of bacteria.

00:19:09.120 --> 00:19:10.770 align:middle line:84%
We see them on
the ends of sperm,

00:19:10.770 --> 00:19:12.360 align:middle line:84%
and that makes them
really important

00:19:12.360 --> 00:19:13.800 align:middle line:84%
because the sperm
couldn't go anywhere

00:19:13.800 --> 00:19:15.216 align:middle line:84%
to create life if
they didn't have

00:19:15.216 --> 00:19:16.800 align:middle line:90%
the cilia, the little tails.

00:19:16.800 --> 00:19:18.900 align:middle line:84%
And many of the bacteria
couldn't function

00:19:18.900 --> 00:19:20.820 align:middle line:90%
the way they do without these.

00:19:20.820 --> 00:19:23.190 align:middle line:84%
And for those cilia
to work, there

00:19:23.190 --> 00:19:28.230 align:middle line:84%
is a very complex series
of over 40 mechanisms

00:19:28.230 --> 00:19:31.860 align:middle line:84%
that must be in
place for the nerves,

00:19:31.860 --> 00:19:35.330 align:middle line:84%
for the chemical reactions,
for the growth of the cells,

00:19:35.330 --> 00:19:38.886 align:middle line:84%
so that little tail can wiggle
and move in a fluid medium.

00:19:38.886 --> 00:19:40.260 align:middle line:84%
If they're not
there all at once,

00:19:40.260 --> 00:19:41.343 align:middle line:90%
they're not going to work.

00:19:41.343 --> 00:19:43.800 align:middle line:84%
They cannot evolve slowly,
gradually over a long period

00:19:43.800 --> 00:19:44.760 align:middle line:90%
of time--

00:19:44.760 --> 00:19:48.150 align:middle line:84%
just as the 20 proteins didn't,
just as what's happening

00:19:48.150 --> 00:19:49.960 align:middle line:90%
in our cells didn't.

00:19:49.960 --> 00:19:51.420 align:middle line:84%
So what I am sharing
with you now--

00:19:51.420 --> 00:19:54.510 align:middle line:90%
just so very clear about this--

00:19:54.510 --> 00:20:00.330 align:middle line:84%
irreducible complexity says that
there are some forms of life

00:20:00.330 --> 00:20:04.530 align:middle line:84%
that simply can not
evolve from simpler forms

00:20:04.530 --> 00:20:07.200 align:middle line:84%
gradually, slowly over
long periods of time.

00:20:07.200 --> 00:20:09.000 align:middle line:84%
I've just given
you three examples.

00:20:09.000 --> 00:20:11.680 align:middle line:90%
Well, DNA is another example.

00:20:11.680 --> 00:20:14.980 align:middle line:84%
DNA is a beautiful example
because it is the very basis--

00:20:14.980 --> 00:20:18.000 align:middle line:84%
it's the blueprint-- for
what's happening in our bodies.

00:20:18.000 --> 00:20:20.640 align:middle line:84%
And scientists now
are recognizing this.

00:20:20.640 --> 00:20:22.830 align:middle line:84%
And I just want
to share with you

00:20:22.830 --> 00:20:25.950 align:middle line:84%
from a very well known
scientist exactly.

00:20:25.950 --> 00:20:29.280 align:middle line:84%
I want you to hear his
words, in scientific words,

00:20:29.280 --> 00:20:32.610 align:middle line:84%
about what this means when we're
seeing it so you know it's not

00:20:32.610 --> 00:20:35.080 align:middle line:90%
just me, my opinion, my theory.

00:20:35.080 --> 00:20:37.920 align:middle line:84%
This is where a body
of scientific thinking

00:20:37.920 --> 00:20:39.360 align:middle line:90%
is now going.

00:20:39.360 --> 00:20:41.760 align:middle line:84%
So here is what this
scientist is saying.

00:20:41.760 --> 00:20:45.420 align:middle line:84%
This is from Dr. Cohen,
published in a research paper.

00:20:45.420 --> 00:20:47.190 align:middle line:90%
It was released in 1984.

00:20:47.190 --> 00:20:49.680 align:middle line:10%
He's a mathematician and
a member of the New York

00:20:49.680 --> 00:20:50.770 align:middle line:10%
Academy of Sciences.

00:20:50.770 --> 00:20:53.720 align:middle line:10%
So this is a very well
credentialed scientist.

00:20:53.720 --> 00:20:55.330 align:middle line:10%
And what he's saying
is this-- quote--

00:20:55.330 --> 00:21:00.090 align:middle line:10%
he says, "At the moment, when
the DNA/RNA system became

00:21:00.090 --> 00:21:03.960 align:middle line:10%
understood," he said, "the
debate between evolution

00:21:03.960 --> 00:21:06.810 align:middle line:10%
and creation should have
come to a screeching halt

00:21:06.810 --> 00:21:10.020 align:middle line:10%
because the
implications of the DNA

00:21:10.020 --> 00:21:13.980 align:middle line:10%
and the RNA are
obvious and clear."

00:21:13.980 --> 00:21:17.470 align:middle line:10%
So what he's saying is that the
moment our technology advanced

00:21:17.470 --> 00:21:21.210 align:middle line:10%
to the point where we could see
what it takes for DNA and its

00:21:21.210 --> 00:21:23.880 align:middle line:10%
complement, RNA, to
work in our bodies,

00:21:23.880 --> 00:21:28.500 align:middle line:10%
the complexities are so great
that the evolutionary theory

00:21:28.500 --> 00:21:30.800 align:middle line:10%
simply cannot explain
those complexities.

00:21:30.800 --> 00:21:33.300 align:middle line:84%
So he's saying this whole debate
should have come to an end.

00:21:33.300 --> 00:21:36.200 align:middle line:84%
It is obvious he's saying,
as a mathematician,

00:21:36.200 --> 00:21:41.850 align:middle line:84%
that there is some intent,
perhaps an intelligence.

00:21:41.850 --> 00:21:44.850 align:middle line:84%
Definitely something
is directing

00:21:44.850 --> 00:21:48.630 align:middle line:84%
this experience,
this mechanism, that

00:21:48.630 --> 00:21:50.820 align:middle line:90%
is at the core of our lives.

00:21:50.820 --> 00:21:54.510 align:middle line:84%
This hearkens back to the
very idea of our origin.

00:21:54.510 --> 00:21:55.410 align:middle line:90%
Who are we?

00:21:55.410 --> 00:21:57.090 align:middle line:90%
Where did we come from?

00:21:57.090 --> 00:22:01.260 align:middle line:84%
What is it that combined those
two chromosomes to produce

00:22:01.260 --> 00:22:03.720 align:middle line:84%
our one, chromosome
number 2, that

00:22:03.720 --> 00:22:07.410 align:middle line:84%
sets us apart from all other
life and makes us unique.

00:22:07.410 --> 00:22:10.830 align:middle line:84%
So I'd like to take this
opportunity and share with you

00:22:10.830 --> 00:22:12.820 align:middle line:90%
yet another perspective.

00:22:12.820 --> 00:22:16.200 align:middle line:84%
And for me, this is a
very personal perspective

00:22:16.200 --> 00:22:18.810 align:middle line:84%
because it involves
a research project

00:22:18.810 --> 00:22:21.810 align:middle line:90%
that I began over 30 years ago.

00:22:21.810 --> 00:22:23.900 align:middle line:90%
My background is scientist.

00:22:23.900 --> 00:22:25.830 align:middle line:84%
I was a degreed geologist
with a background

00:22:25.830 --> 00:22:28.620 align:middle line:84%
in marine ocean and life
sciences and mathematics

00:22:28.620 --> 00:22:29.970 align:middle line:90%
and physics.

00:22:29.970 --> 00:22:32.070 align:middle line:84%
All of these things worked
together for me early

00:22:32.070 --> 00:22:33.580 align:middle line:90%
in my life.

00:22:33.580 --> 00:22:36.090 align:middle line:84%
And when I looked
at them honestly and

00:22:36.090 --> 00:22:39.240 align:middle line:84%
asked myself truthfully
and factually--

00:22:39.240 --> 00:22:41.640 align:middle line:90%
what is nature telling us?

00:22:41.640 --> 00:22:45.420 align:middle line:84%
My sense at that time
early in my life was there

00:22:45.420 --> 00:22:48.900 align:middle line:84%
is something, something
more than evolution

00:22:48.900 --> 00:22:50.670 align:middle line:84%
that underlies our
existence, something

00:22:50.670 --> 00:22:53.320 align:middle line:84%
that is not being acknowledged
in the mainstream.

00:22:53.320 --> 00:22:56.130 align:middle line:84%
And while the fossils
are interesting,

00:22:56.130 --> 00:22:57.810 align:middle line:90%
I don't think they're about us.

00:22:57.810 --> 00:23:01.050 align:middle line:84%
And while the DNA is now
telling us more information,

00:23:01.050 --> 00:23:02.640 align:middle line:90%
we're still lacking a context.

00:23:02.640 --> 00:23:05.250 align:middle line:84%
And this may be one of
those places where we're not

00:23:05.250 --> 00:23:08.750 align:middle line:84%
going to find the answer
in the mystery itself,

00:23:08.750 --> 00:23:12.450 align:middle line:84%
where we'll have to find
the answer in other avenues

00:23:12.450 --> 00:23:15.825 align:middle line:84%
that help us to understand and
lead to solving this mystery.

00:23:15.825 --> 00:23:19.960 align:middle line:84%
So for me, a passion of
mine, as I mentioned earlier,

00:23:19.960 --> 00:23:25.560 align:middle line:84%
has been to look for clues in
our most ancient and cherished

00:23:25.560 --> 00:23:29.310 align:middle line:84%
traditions to see what those
clues may be saying to us

00:23:29.310 --> 00:23:31.650 align:middle line:84%
or what did our ancestors
know in their time

00:23:31.650 --> 00:23:34.766 align:middle line:84%
that we're only beginning
to discover in ours.

00:23:34.766 --> 00:23:36.390 align:middle line:84%
And I've always had
a very strong sense

00:23:36.390 --> 00:23:39.990 align:middle line:84%
that if we know where and
how to look into our past

00:23:39.990 --> 00:23:43.290 align:middle line:84%
that there are insights that
have been preserved in some

00:23:43.290 --> 00:23:46.500 align:middle line:84%
of our most ancient
texts and traditions,

00:23:46.500 --> 00:23:50.685 align:middle line:84%
insights that maybe just aren't
so well understood today.

00:23:50.685 --> 00:23:52.560 align:middle line:84%
So I'm going to share
with you very quickly--

00:23:52.560 --> 00:23:55.320 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to condense
30 years of research

00:23:55.320 --> 00:23:59.340 align:middle line:84%
into a project that
can only happen when

00:23:59.340 --> 00:24:02.610 align:middle line:84%
we cross the traditional
boundaries of science

00:24:02.610 --> 00:24:04.486 align:middle line:90%
and spirituality.

00:24:04.486 --> 00:24:06.360 align:middle line:84%
Now, I was told as a
scientist that these two

00:24:06.360 --> 00:24:08.120 align:middle line:90%
are mutually incompatible.

00:24:08.120 --> 00:24:10.020 align:middle line:90%
You must choose-- I was told--

00:24:10.020 --> 00:24:12.890 align:middle line:84%
the path of science or
the path of spirituality,

00:24:12.890 --> 00:24:15.540 align:middle line:84%
that the two were in
fact mutually exclusive.

00:24:15.540 --> 00:24:16.860 align:middle line:90%
Here's my thinking.

00:24:16.860 --> 00:24:18.570 align:middle line:84%
We're living in a
time of extremes.

00:24:18.570 --> 00:24:22.920 align:middle line:10%
We owe it to ourself to draw
upon every facet, every source

00:24:22.920 --> 00:24:26.040 align:middle line:10%
of information possible,
to give ourselves

00:24:26.040 --> 00:24:28.180 align:middle line:10%
whatever it is we
need and to call

00:24:28.180 --> 00:24:32.960 align:middle line:10%
whatever it is that exists so
that we can weave a new story--

00:24:32.960 --> 00:24:34.800 align:middle line:10%
honestly answer the
questions for ourselves

00:24:34.800 --> 00:24:37.780 align:middle line:10%
that we can thrive in
our time of extremes

00:24:37.780 --> 00:24:41.185 align:middle line:10%
so we can end the suffering and
move into a new way of living

00:24:41.185 --> 00:24:41.985 align:middle line:10%
and thinking.

00:24:41.985 --> 00:24:45.240 align:middle line:84%
And for me, I believe those
clues exist in our past

00:24:45.240 --> 00:24:47.220 align:middle line:84%
as well as in the
new discoveries

00:24:47.220 --> 00:24:49.050 align:middle line:90%
we're talking about now.

00:24:49.050 --> 00:24:51.660 align:middle line:84%
So here's what
that meant for me--

00:24:51.660 --> 00:24:53.880 align:middle line:84%
I went into one of
the oldest and most

00:24:53.880 --> 00:24:58.860 align:middle line:84%
mysterious spiritual texts that
has ever been known to exist.

00:24:58.860 --> 00:25:01.320 align:middle line:10%
And it's called
the Sefer Yetzirah.

00:25:01.320 --> 00:25:06.210 align:middle line:10%
It is a Hebrew text that is so
mystical that the rabbis say

00:25:06.210 --> 00:25:09.690 align:middle line:10%
it is not even something
that can be studied

00:25:09.690 --> 00:25:13.090 align:middle line:10%
by traditional students because
the mystery is so deep and so

00:25:13.090 --> 00:25:13.890 align:middle line:10%
great.

00:25:13.890 --> 00:25:17.400 align:middle line:84%
It's a relatively short text,
only about 1,000 lines long.

00:25:17.400 --> 00:25:20.160 align:middle line:84%
And it's only been
translated into English once.

00:25:20.160 --> 00:25:23.800 align:middle line:84%
And I took that translation,
and I read it through it very,

00:25:23.800 --> 00:25:25.970 align:middle line:90%
very carefully as a scientist.

00:25:25.970 --> 00:25:27.750 align:middle line:10%
And what I found is this--

00:25:27.750 --> 00:25:30.420 align:middle line:10%
the Sefer Yetzirah
is essentially

00:25:30.420 --> 00:25:36.420 align:middle line:10%
a step-by-step description
as if someone, an observer,

00:25:36.420 --> 00:25:40.350 align:middle line:10%
were present the day that the
universe and humankind were

00:25:40.350 --> 00:25:45.900 align:middle line:10%
created, an observer
describing the process in line

00:25:45.900 --> 00:25:49.230 align:middle line:10%
after line, the 1,000
lines, what it took

00:25:49.230 --> 00:25:52.130 align:middle line:10%
to get us where we are today.

00:25:52.130 --> 00:25:55.680 align:middle line:90%
But the text is 3,000 years old.

00:25:55.680 --> 00:25:58.380 align:middle line:10%
Whoever wrote that
text, 3,000 years old,

00:25:58.380 --> 00:26:01.020 align:middle line:10%
and it may be that whoever
wrote it received it

00:26:01.020 --> 00:26:04.140 align:middle line:10%
from a wisdom that's even
older than 3,000 years.

00:26:04.140 --> 00:26:06.330 align:middle line:84%
Whoever it is that put
that text together,

00:26:06.330 --> 00:26:07.830 align:middle line:84%
they didn't know
what we know today.

00:26:07.830 --> 00:26:10.260 align:middle line:90%
They didn't know about science.

00:26:10.260 --> 00:26:13.230 align:middle line:10%
They didn't know about the
periodic table of elements.

00:26:13.230 --> 00:26:17.970 align:middle line:10%
So I began to interpret
the text through the eyes

00:26:17.970 --> 00:26:19.560 align:middle line:10%
of a scientist.

00:26:19.560 --> 00:26:25.920 align:middle line:84%
And when the text began talking
about the elements of the earth

00:26:25.920 --> 00:26:30.550 align:middle line:84%
and of the wind and of
the sun, I asked myself

00:26:30.550 --> 00:26:32.710 align:middle line:84%
if I were writing
this text today,

00:26:32.710 --> 00:26:35.470 align:middle line:84%
are those the words
that I would use?

00:26:35.470 --> 00:26:38.590 align:middle line:90%
And my answer was, probably not.

00:26:38.590 --> 00:26:41.920 align:middle line:84%
As a scientist, when
I talk about the sun,

00:26:41.920 --> 00:26:43.660 align:middle line:84%
rather than calling
it the sun, I

00:26:43.660 --> 00:26:46.340 align:middle line:84%
would refer to the most
dominant element in the sun,

00:26:46.340 --> 00:26:51.020 align:middle line:84%
which is hydrogen. When
I talk about the air,

00:26:51.020 --> 00:26:55.010 align:middle line:84%
the wind, I would refer to the
most dominant element, which

00:26:55.010 --> 00:27:00.260 align:middle line:84%
is oxygen. And I began to
look at these overlaps.

00:27:00.260 --> 00:27:02.150 align:middle line:84%
Well, there's
another great mystery

00:27:02.150 --> 00:27:05.570 align:middle line:84%
when it comes to the
languages of our past.

00:27:05.570 --> 00:27:06.590 align:middle line:90%
Scientists know this.

00:27:06.590 --> 00:27:09.050 align:middle line:90%
Linguists know this very well.

00:27:09.050 --> 00:27:13.220 align:middle line:84%
Every language,
every single alphabet

00:27:13.220 --> 00:27:15.830 align:middle line:84%
that has ever been
known to exist,

00:27:15.830 --> 00:27:22.460 align:middle line:84%
bar none, cuneiform, Arabic,
Hebrew, Sanskrit, every Greek,

00:27:22.460 --> 00:27:25.490 align:middle line:84%
every alphabet that's
ever been created

00:27:25.490 --> 00:27:30.860 align:middle line:84%
has always had a mysterious
number linked to the letter

00:27:30.860 --> 00:27:32.420 align:middle line:90%
that it represents.

00:27:32.420 --> 00:27:34.700 align:middle line:84%
No one knows for sure where
those numbers came from.

00:27:34.700 --> 00:27:35.970 align:middle line:90%
The numbers never change.

00:27:35.970 --> 00:27:37.580 align:middle line:10%
They are a constant.

00:27:37.580 --> 00:27:41.330 align:middle line:84%
So the numbers that are
linked to the letters

00:27:41.330 --> 00:27:43.220 align:middle line:90%
of ancient alphabets--

00:27:43.220 --> 00:27:46.760 align:middle line:84%
they allow us to think of
those alphabets mathematically.

00:27:46.760 --> 00:27:49.190 align:middle line:84%
So here's what I
did as a scientist.

00:27:49.190 --> 00:27:52.850 align:middle line:84%
I compared the ancient
texts 3,000 years old

00:27:52.850 --> 00:27:54.770 align:middle line:84%
and the elements
that it describes

00:27:54.770 --> 00:28:00.100 align:middle line:84%
that make us with the elements
of the periodic table.

00:28:00.100 --> 00:28:03.260 align:middle line:84%
The ancient elements of
hydrogen, nitrogen, oxygen,

00:28:03.260 --> 00:28:06.340 align:middle line:84%
and carbon we find in the
periodic table as the letters,

00:28:06.340 --> 00:28:08.980 align:middle line:84%
and they have numbers
associated with them.

00:28:08.980 --> 00:28:12.850 align:middle line:84%
And the numbers that I linked
from those ancient alphabets,

00:28:12.850 --> 00:28:16.420 align:middle line:84%
as I looked at the atomic
mass and the atomic weight

00:28:16.420 --> 00:28:19.390 align:middle line:84%
of our elements, lo and
behold, they are the same.

00:28:19.390 --> 00:28:20.620 align:middle line:90%
They overlap.

00:28:20.620 --> 00:28:24.970 align:middle line:84%
The atomic mass of
hydrogen links precisely

00:28:24.970 --> 00:28:28.510 align:middle line:84%
with very specific letters
in ancient Hebrew, Arabic,

00:28:28.510 --> 00:28:30.130 align:middle line:90%
and Sanskrit.

00:28:30.130 --> 00:28:33.864 align:middle line:84%
The atomic mass for
oxygen links precisely

00:28:33.864 --> 00:28:35.530 align:middle line:84%
with letters in those
ancient alphabets.

00:28:35.530 --> 00:28:37.300 align:middle line:90%
So here's what I did.

00:28:37.300 --> 00:28:44.080 align:middle line:84%
I replaced the letters
in the ancient text

00:28:44.080 --> 00:28:46.250 align:middle line:84%
with the elements of
the periodic table.

00:28:46.250 --> 00:28:49.610 align:middle line:84%
And when I did that
and applied it to DNA--

00:28:49.610 --> 00:28:53.650 align:middle line:84%
because DNA is made of hydrogen,
nitrogen, oxygen, and carbon

00:28:53.650 --> 00:28:55.840 align:middle line:90%
in different combinations--

00:28:55.840 --> 00:28:58.390 align:middle line:84%
when I took the
ancient alphabets

00:28:58.390 --> 00:29:02.830 align:middle line:84%
and I replaced the elements of
the DNA with those alphabets,

00:29:02.830 --> 00:29:07.120 align:middle line:84%
the DNA began to read as you
read the letters in a sentence

00:29:07.120 --> 00:29:09.130 align:middle line:90%
in the page upon a book.

00:29:09.130 --> 00:29:13.240 align:middle line:84%
Our DNA holds a
message that can only

00:29:13.240 --> 00:29:15.640 align:middle line:84%
be read by crossing the
traditional boundaries

00:29:15.640 --> 00:29:17.740 align:middle line:90%
of science and spirituality.

00:29:17.740 --> 00:29:21.520 align:middle line:84%
And it helps us one more piece
with this clue of our origin

00:29:21.520 --> 00:29:24.220 align:middle line:84%
because the very first
sentence, the very first line

00:29:24.220 --> 00:29:27.040 align:middle line:84%
of every strand
of every human DNA

00:29:27.040 --> 00:29:29.000 align:middle line:90%
says exactly the same thing.

00:29:29.000 --> 00:29:30.730 align:middle line:90%
And here's what it says--

00:29:30.730 --> 00:29:33.580 align:middle line:84%
when we replace those letters
with the periodic table

00:29:33.580 --> 00:29:38.300 align:middle line:84%
and we begin reading the
text, the very first sentence

00:29:38.300 --> 00:29:41.560 align:middle line:84%
in every strand of DNA
literally says the words

00:29:41.560 --> 00:29:46.420 align:middle line:90%
"God Eternal Within The Body."

00:29:46.420 --> 00:29:50.065 align:middle line:90%
"God Eternal Within the Body."

00:29:50.065 --> 00:29:52.650 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't say who God
is, how that got there,

00:29:52.650 --> 00:29:53.450 align:middle line:90%
or why it's there.

00:29:53.450 --> 00:29:55.366 align:middle line:84%
I'm just sharing with
you what happens when we

00:29:55.366 --> 00:29:58.270 align:middle line:90%
marry science and spirituality.

00:29:58.270 --> 00:30:00.820 align:middle line:84%
So that gives us
one more insight.

00:30:00.820 --> 00:30:04.840 align:middle line:84%
Now that we know that we
appeared on this earth 200,000

00:30:04.840 --> 00:30:07.630 align:middle line:84%
years ago and we know
that we haven't changed

00:30:07.630 --> 00:30:10.780 align:middle line:84%
and now that we know that the
DNA that makes us who we are

00:30:10.780 --> 00:30:14.560 align:middle line:84%
appears to be more than a
random process of biology,

00:30:14.560 --> 00:30:19.370 align:middle line:84%
the question now is what does it
mean to have that kind of DNA?

00:30:19.370 --> 00:30:20.420 align:middle line:90%
What do we do with it?

00:30:20.420 --> 00:30:22.700 align:middle line:84%
How do we awaken the
extraordinary abilities

00:30:22.700 --> 00:30:25.720 align:middle line:84%
that that DNA, that fusion,
gives to us in our lives

00:30:25.720 --> 00:30:27.412 align:middle line:84%
and gives to no
other form of life?

00:30:27.412 --> 00:30:30.580 align:middle line:84%
In our next episode, that's
what we're going to explore.

00:30:30.580 --> 00:30:33.940 align:middle line:84%
I want to thank you for joining
me for this program today.

00:30:33.940 --> 00:30:35.920 align:middle line:84%
And be sure to tune
in for our next

00:30:35.920 --> 00:30:38.020 align:middle line:84%
all new episode of
"Missing Links",

00:30:38.020 --> 00:30:43.200 align:middle line:84%
the deep truth of our origin
history, destiny, and fate.

00:30:43.200 --> 00:30:56.968 align:middle line:90%
