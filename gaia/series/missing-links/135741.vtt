00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:27.900 align:middle line:84%
>> My name's Gregg Braden
and I'd like to welcome you

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:31.740 align:middle line:84%
to "Missing Links: The Deep
Truth of Our Origin, History,

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:33.570 align:middle line:90%
Destiny, and Fate."

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:35.700 align:middle line:84%
In this episode,
we'll explore one

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:37.830 align:middle line:84%
of the paradigm-shattering
discoveries

00:00:37.830 --> 00:00:40.330 align:middle line:84%
that you just aren't seeing
in mainstream science

00:00:40.330 --> 00:00:41.910 align:middle line:90%
and mainstream media.

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:44.430 align:middle line:84%
In our last episode,
we identified

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:47.700 align:middle line:84%
the three natural cycles that
are colliding in our world

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:50.280 align:middle line:84%
right now and wreaking
havoc on our lives.

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:54.330 align:middle line:84%
They're the cycles of climate
change, cycles of economy,

00:00:54.330 --> 00:00:57.430 align:middle line:90%
and cycles of human conflict.

00:00:57.430 --> 00:00:59.790 align:middle line:84%
Well, each of these
cycles alone would

00:00:59.790 --> 00:01:02.190 align:middle line:84%
be enough to disrupt
our lives and challenge

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:04.709 align:middle line:84%
our ways of living, and
the fact that all of them

00:01:04.709 --> 00:01:07.920 align:middle line:84%
are converging right now, it
leaves very little question

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:11.610 align:middle line:84%
as to why we're living
this time of extremes.

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:12.630 align:middle line:90%
Question now.

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:13.755 align:middle line:90%
So what can we do about it?

00:01:13.755 --> 00:01:15.820 align:middle line:84%
If we can't change
the cycles themselves,

00:01:15.820 --> 00:01:18.450 align:middle line:84%
then what can we change to make
our lives better and create

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:21.210 align:middle line:84%
better families and
stronger communities as we

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:22.750 align:middle line:90%
go through this change?

00:01:22.750 --> 00:01:24.830 align:middle line:84%
Well, the answer
to this question

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:26.880 align:middle line:84%
is what I want to talk
to you about today.

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:30.090 align:middle line:84%
It lies in the way
we ask ourselves

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:32.040 align:middle line:84%
a timeless question
and our willingness

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:33.720 align:middle line:90%
to answer that question.

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:36.060 align:middle line:84%
As I mentioned before,
there's a lot of good news

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:38.250 align:middle line:84%
that comes with our time
of extremes and part

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:40.740 align:middle line:84%
of that news is
that we already have

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:43.470 align:middle line:84%
the solutions to the big
problems in our world.

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:46.000 align:middle line:84%
We have the
technological solutions.

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:47.700 align:middle line:90%
Here's what I mean by that.

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:50.280 align:middle line:84%
We already have all
the food we need

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:52.890 align:middle line:84%
to feed every mouth of every
child, every woman, every man,

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:54.780 align:middle line:90%
on the face of the Earth today.

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:57.390 align:middle line:84%
The lack of food
is not the reason

00:01:57.390 --> 00:02:00.600 align:middle line:84%
that our global family goes to
bed hungry when and in the way

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:01.890 align:middle line:90%
that they do.

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:03.630 align:middle line:84%
The United Nations
recently told us

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:07.230 align:middle line:84%
that we have food security
for at least another 50 years

00:02:07.230 --> 00:02:10.080 align:middle line:84%
barring some calamity
like an asteroid hitting

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:13.690 align:middle line:84%
the Earth or a solar flare
wiping out the planet.

00:02:13.690 --> 00:02:15.150 align:middle line:90%
We have the food.

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:16.370 align:middle line:90%
So it's not the lack of food.

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:19.470 align:middle line:84%
It is the lack of the
priority that has yet

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:22.170 align:middle line:84%
to be made for that
food to be placed

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:24.180 align:middle line:90%
where it's needed right now.

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:27.240 align:middle line:84%
We already have all
of the technology

00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:29.910 align:middle line:84%
that we need to
create electricity

00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:32.610 align:middle line:84%
and to bring it into
the home of every family

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:35.580 align:middle line:84%
on the planet that wants
to have electricity.

00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:37.950 align:middle line:84%
I found recently that not all
families want electricity,

00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:41.250 align:middle line:84%
but those that do, we have
the way to create that power.

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:42.810 align:middle line:90%
We can do it affordably.

00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:45.270 align:middle line:84%
We can do it with
zero greenhouse gases.

00:02:45.270 --> 00:02:48.000 align:middle line:84%
And we can do it in a
way that's sustainable.

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:50.520 align:middle line:84%
We've already
discovered how to build

00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:55.200 align:middle line:84%
economies that are based
in cooperation and sharing,

00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:57.750 align:middle line:84%
rather than competition
and scarcity.

00:02:57.750 --> 00:03:00.870 align:middle line:84%
And we already know how to
build clean, sustainable, and

00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:03.660 align:middle line:84%
self-sufficient communities
like the one you're seeing

00:03:03.660 --> 00:03:04.870 align:middle line:90%
on your screen right now.

00:03:04.870 --> 00:03:09.080 align:middle line:10%
This community is designed
to house over 5,000 people.

00:03:09.080 --> 00:03:10.960 align:middle line:10%
They grow all of their own food.

00:03:10.960 --> 00:03:12.990 align:middle line:10%
They produce all their
own energy and they

00:03:12.990 --> 00:03:15.480 align:middle line:10%
have 100% employment
rate because everyone

00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:18.022 align:middle line:10%
that wants to work is
working to grow the food

00:03:18.022 --> 00:03:19.980 align:middle line:10%
and produce the power to
sustain the community.

00:03:19.980 --> 00:03:24.120 align:middle line:84%
This one is based in northern
Arizona in the United States.

00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:27.280 align:middle line:84%
We already have
everything we need.

00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:30.510 align:middle line:10%
The knowledge to reverse
disease, to reverse aging,

00:03:30.510 --> 00:03:33.360 align:middle line:10%
and to trigger the
healing mechanism

00:03:33.360 --> 00:03:35.640 align:middle line:10%
within our human body.

00:03:35.640 --> 00:03:39.120 align:middle line:84%
Every organ in the human
body is now documented

00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:43.950 align:middle line:84%
under laboratory conditions
with the ability to heal itself.

00:03:43.950 --> 00:03:46.290 align:middle line:84%
Even the organs we were
told could not do so,

00:03:46.290 --> 00:03:49.470 align:middle line:84%
brain tissue, spinal cord
tissue, heart tissue,

00:03:49.470 --> 00:03:52.440 align:middle line:84%
pancreatic tissue,
all of them now

00:03:52.440 --> 00:03:55.650 align:middle line:84%
are documented with the ability
to reverse disease and heal

00:03:55.650 --> 00:03:56.760 align:middle line:90%
themselves.

00:03:56.760 --> 00:04:01.400 align:middle line:84%
The key is they must be
given the right conditions.

00:04:01.400 --> 00:04:05.230 align:middle line:84%
So when you hear that all of
these solutions already exist,

00:04:05.230 --> 00:04:08.224 align:middle line:84%
when you hear that
they're already available,

00:04:08.224 --> 00:04:10.890 align:middle line:84%
there's probably a question that
immediately comes to your mind,

00:04:10.890 --> 00:04:13.223 align:middle line:84%
and it's probably the same
question that came to my mind

00:04:13.223 --> 00:04:15.580 align:middle line:84%
when I discovered
this technology

00:04:15.580 --> 00:04:19.240 align:middle line:84%
and that the solutions
have already been created.

00:04:19.240 --> 00:04:21.160 align:middle line:90%
The question is where are they?

00:04:21.160 --> 00:04:23.200 align:middle line:84%
Why don't we see them
in the world right now?

00:04:23.200 --> 00:04:25.090 align:middle line:84%
Why aren't we seeing
them in every nation?

00:04:25.090 --> 00:04:27.490 align:middle line:84%
Why aren't we seeing
this technology

00:04:27.490 --> 00:04:28.770 align:middle line:90%
to create the clean energy?

00:04:28.770 --> 00:04:31.270 align:middle line:84%
Why aren't we seeing the food
being distributed the way

00:04:31.270 --> 00:04:33.070 align:middle line:90%
it needs to be distributed?

00:04:33.070 --> 00:04:35.470 align:middle line:84%
Well, the answer
to that question

00:04:35.470 --> 00:04:38.710 align:middle line:84%
opens the door to what I believe
is an even greater crisis.

00:04:38.710 --> 00:04:41.480 align:middle line:84%
It's a silent crisis very
few people are talking about.

00:04:41.480 --> 00:04:43.510 align:middle line:90%
It's a crisis in thinking.

00:04:43.510 --> 00:04:46.240 align:middle line:84%
We've got to change
the way we think

00:04:46.240 --> 00:04:49.780 align:middle line:84%
before all of these solutions
can make sense in our lives

00:04:49.780 --> 00:04:52.870 align:middle line:84%
and unless the thinking
allows for the possibilities,

00:04:52.870 --> 00:04:56.740 align:middle line:84%
the solutions simply are
not being implemented.

00:04:56.740 --> 00:05:01.030 align:middle line:84%
Let me give you an example of
what I mean when I say this.

00:05:01.030 --> 00:05:04.870 align:middle line:84%
In the 1960s, we saw
something amazing

00:05:04.870 --> 00:05:06.610 align:middle line:90%
happening on this planet.

00:05:06.610 --> 00:05:11.170 align:middle line:84%
1961, then President
John F. Kennedy

00:05:11.170 --> 00:05:13.710 align:middle line:84%
gave a speech to the
United States Congress.

00:05:13.710 --> 00:05:16.600 align:middle line:84%
What he said in that speech, he
said, by the end of the decade,

00:05:16.600 --> 00:05:18.880 align:middle line:84%
by the end of the
1960s, he said,

00:05:18.880 --> 00:05:22.090 align:middle line:84%
we vow to place
a man on the moon

00:05:22.090 --> 00:05:23.920 align:middle line:90%
and to bring him back safely.

00:05:23.920 --> 00:05:26.830 align:middle line:84%
>> I believe that this
nation should commit itself

00:05:26.830 --> 00:05:30.790 align:middle line:84%
to achieving the goal,
before this decade is out,

00:05:30.790 --> 00:05:33.730 align:middle line:84%
of landing a man on the moon
and returning him safely

00:05:33.730 --> 00:05:35.440 align:middle line:90%
to the Earth.

00:05:35.440 --> 00:05:38.380 align:middle line:84%
No single space
project in this period

00:05:38.380 --> 00:05:40.780 align:middle line:84%
will be more
impressive to mankind.

00:05:40.780 --> 00:05:45.040 align:middle line:84%
>> And he met that goal with
the help of the science,

00:05:45.040 --> 00:05:47.950 align:middle line:84%
the engineering, the
ingenuity, the courage,

00:05:47.950 --> 00:05:50.740 align:middle line:84%
and the will of all the
people that made that happen.

00:05:50.740 --> 00:05:53.710 align:middle line:84%
He met that goal in
less than the 10 years

00:05:53.710 --> 00:05:56.170 align:middle line:90%
that he had committed to.

00:05:56.170 --> 00:05:58.120 align:middle line:84%
People ask me all
the time, Greg,

00:05:58.120 --> 00:06:00.040 align:middle line:90%
how did that happen so quickly?

00:06:00.040 --> 00:06:03.070 align:middle line:84%
How were we able to
develop the technology

00:06:03.070 --> 00:06:06.610 align:middle line:84%
and create the blueprints
and develop the engineering

00:06:06.610 --> 00:06:09.014 align:middle line:84%
skills to build the
spacecraft to send

00:06:09.014 --> 00:06:10.930 align:middle line:84%
those people and the
communication to the moon

00:06:10.930 --> 00:06:11.860 align:middle line:90%
and bring them back?

00:06:11.860 --> 00:06:13.630 align:middle line:90%
How did we do that so quickly?

00:06:13.630 --> 00:06:15.310 align:middle line:84%
Well, the answer
to that question

00:06:15.310 --> 00:06:17.830 align:middle line:84%
is the same answer to
the crisis in thinking

00:06:17.830 --> 00:06:20.080 align:middle line:84%
that I'm talking to
you about right now,

00:06:20.080 --> 00:06:21.590 align:middle line:90%
and here is the answer.

00:06:21.590 --> 00:06:24.160 align:middle line:84%
The answer is that
all of the solutions

00:06:24.160 --> 00:06:27.130 align:middle line:84%
to send a human to the moon
and bring that human back,

00:06:27.130 --> 00:06:29.980 align:middle line:90%
they already existed in 1961.

00:06:29.980 --> 00:06:33.340 align:middle line:84%
As difficult as
that might sound,

00:06:33.340 --> 00:06:37.370 align:middle line:84%
we already had all of
that technology available.

00:06:37.370 --> 00:06:40.120 align:middle line:10%
However, until John
Kennedy made it

00:06:40.120 --> 00:06:43.000 align:middle line:10%
a priority through
his leadership,

00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:45.970 align:middle line:10%
we never had the mandate
to focus that priority

00:06:45.970 --> 00:06:48.520 align:middle line:10%
to achieve a specific goal.

00:06:48.520 --> 00:06:51.580 align:middle line:84%
And I'm using that as an example
because that is precisely

00:06:51.580 --> 00:06:53.530 align:middle line:84%
the opportunity that
we have right now.

00:06:53.530 --> 00:06:55.030 align:middle line:84%
With leadership--
and I'm not saying

00:06:55.030 --> 00:06:57.370 align:middle line:84%
it has to come from
any specific country

00:06:57.370 --> 00:06:59.050 align:middle line:84%
or any specific
organization-- I'm

00:06:59.050 --> 00:07:02.890 align:middle line:84%
simply saying that
if we have the focus

00:07:02.890 --> 00:07:07.210 align:middle line:84%
to bring what we already
have achieved together

00:07:07.210 --> 00:07:11.110 align:middle line:84%
and to apply it in a meaningful
way to our global family,

00:07:11.110 --> 00:07:14.500 align:middle line:84%
we have the opportunity to
end much of the suffering

00:07:14.500 --> 00:07:17.740 align:middle line:84%
and the roots of the wars
that we're seeing today.

00:07:17.740 --> 00:07:20.410 align:middle line:84%
But to do that, we've
got to think differently.

00:07:20.410 --> 00:07:25.120 align:middle line:84%
It all comes down to the way
we answer a single question.

00:07:25.120 --> 00:07:30.100 align:middle line:84%
As individuals, each of us
answers a single question

00:07:30.100 --> 00:07:31.040 align:middle line:90%
in our lifetime.

00:07:31.040 --> 00:07:33.220 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes it's a
conscious answer.

00:07:33.220 --> 00:07:35.380 align:middle line:90%
Sometimes it's subconscious.

00:07:35.380 --> 00:07:38.380 align:middle line:84%
Every human who's ever
walked the face of the Earth

00:07:38.380 --> 00:07:40.990 align:middle line:84%
and looked into the cosmos
in the dead of night

00:07:40.990 --> 00:07:44.080 align:middle line:84%
has asked themselves this
question silently, out loud,

00:07:44.080 --> 00:07:46.750 align:middle line:90%
consciously, or subconsciously.

00:07:46.750 --> 00:07:50.224 align:middle line:84%
The question, it's the
basis for every choice

00:07:50.224 --> 00:07:51.640 align:middle line:84%
that we've ever
made in our lives.

00:07:51.640 --> 00:07:53.431 align:middle line:84%
The way we answer this
question, the reason

00:07:53.431 --> 00:07:56.710 align:middle line:84%
for every decision that we
have ever made in our lives

00:07:56.710 --> 00:07:59.110 align:middle line:84%
is linked to the way we
answer this question.

00:07:59.110 --> 00:08:03.160 align:middle line:84%
The heart of every challenge
we will ever have in our lives

00:08:03.160 --> 00:08:07.000 align:middle line:84%
is directly linked to the
way we answer this question.

00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:09.160 align:middle line:90%
So what is the question?

00:08:09.160 --> 00:08:13.840 align:middle line:84%
Please do not be deceived by
the simplicity of this question.

00:08:13.840 --> 00:08:14.950 align:middle line:90%
It is deceptively simple.

00:08:14.950 --> 00:08:18.940 align:middle line:84%
The question is simply
this, who are we?

00:08:18.940 --> 00:08:20.060 align:middle line:90%
Who are we?

00:08:20.060 --> 00:08:24.460 align:middle line:84%
Or as individuals, we ask
the question, who am I?

00:08:24.460 --> 00:08:28.810 align:middle line:84%
The way we answer this question,
it's important for this reason.

00:08:28.810 --> 00:08:30.250 align:middle line:84%
The way you answer
the question--

00:08:30.250 --> 00:08:32.620 align:middle line:84%
I want to make this
personal-- the way

00:08:32.620 --> 00:08:36.429 align:middle line:84%
you answer the question,
who am I for yourself, it

00:08:36.429 --> 00:08:40.539 align:middle line:84%
forms the lens, the
perceptual lens,

00:08:40.539 --> 00:08:43.600 align:middle line:84%
through which you
will see yourself,

00:08:43.600 --> 00:08:45.730 align:middle line:84%
through which you
will see other people,

00:08:45.730 --> 00:08:47.860 align:middle line:84%
through which you
will see the world,

00:08:47.860 --> 00:08:51.130 align:middle line:84%
through which you will see
every relationship, every job,

00:08:51.130 --> 00:08:53.890 align:middle line:84%
every career, every
health care choice,

00:08:53.890 --> 00:08:55.720 align:middle line:90%
every financial decision.

00:08:55.720 --> 00:08:59.560 align:middle line:84%
They all filter through
this perception of the way

00:08:59.560 --> 00:09:01.840 align:middle line:84%
we answer the
question, who am I?

00:09:01.840 --> 00:09:05.260 align:middle line:84%
All of a sudden, I can't think
of a more important question

00:09:05.260 --> 00:09:07.900 align:middle line:84%
for us to answer because it is
the foundation of our lives.

00:09:07.900 --> 00:09:09.760 align:middle line:84%
It's the foundation
of everything

00:09:09.760 --> 00:09:12.061 align:middle line:90%
that we do in our lives.

00:09:12.061 --> 00:09:16.930 align:middle line:84%
Well, I've spent the bulk of my
adult life searching the world

00:09:16.930 --> 00:09:19.630 align:middle line:84%
to answer this
question for myself.

00:09:19.630 --> 00:09:22.270 align:middle line:84%
I wanted to know for myself
who am I as an individual?

00:09:22.270 --> 00:09:24.760 align:middle line:90%
Who are we as humans?

00:09:24.760 --> 00:09:26.410 align:middle line:84%
What are we doing
here and what is

00:09:26.410 --> 00:09:28.630 align:middle line:90%
our relationship to the world?

00:09:28.630 --> 00:09:31.660 align:middle line:84%
Let me just share with you a
little bit about my thinking.

00:09:31.660 --> 00:09:35.830 align:middle line:84%
As an engineer, as a
scientist, as a geologist,

00:09:35.830 --> 00:09:39.790 align:middle line:84%
my thinking has been that if
I can find the places least

00:09:39.790 --> 00:09:44.500 align:middle line:84%
disturbed in the modern
world that the information

00:09:44.500 --> 00:09:48.145 align:middle line:84%
our ancestors left for us,
that they knew in their time,

00:09:48.145 --> 00:09:51.392 align:middle line:84%
that maybe we're only
now discovering in ours,

00:09:51.392 --> 00:09:53.350 align:middle line:84%
or the information that
they knew in their time

00:09:53.350 --> 00:09:57.920 align:middle line:84%
that we have yet to discover, if
I could find those places that

00:09:57.920 --> 00:09:59.510 align:middle line:84%
were least disturbed,
the information

00:09:59.510 --> 00:10:00.722 align:middle line:90%
would be more intact.

00:10:00.722 --> 00:10:02.180 align:middle line:84%
Very few people
would have seen it.

00:10:02.180 --> 00:10:04.100 align:middle line:84%
It wouldn't have been
disturbed the way

00:10:04.100 --> 00:10:07.220 align:middle line:84%
that so many of the easy to get
to places have already been.

00:10:07.220 --> 00:10:09.830 align:middle line:84%
Well, I want to
tell you, my journey

00:10:09.830 --> 00:10:13.730 align:middle line:84%
has taken me on some of
the most amazing journeys

00:10:13.730 --> 00:10:16.730 align:middle line:84%
and to some of the most
amazingly magnificent,

00:10:16.730 --> 00:10:19.820 align:middle line:84%
remote, isolated,
pristine, beautiful place

00:10:19.820 --> 00:10:22.490 align:middle line:90%
remaining in this planet today.

00:10:22.490 --> 00:10:24.980 align:middle line:84%
I've been to some of the
most amazing temples.

00:10:24.980 --> 00:10:29.150 align:middle line:84%
I've been to some of the most
awesome, awesome monasteries

00:10:29.150 --> 00:10:30.920 align:middle line:90%
on the face of the Earth today.

00:10:30.920 --> 00:10:33.340 align:middle line:10%
And I've been to very
humble monasteries.

00:10:33.340 --> 00:10:36.170 align:middle line:10%
It was on this
particular monastery,

00:10:36.170 --> 00:10:40.760 align:middle line:10%
on the Tibetan Plateau,
16,000 feet above sea level,

00:10:40.760 --> 00:10:44.150 align:middle line:10%
it took six days out of the
capitol of Tibet, out of Lhasa,

00:10:44.150 --> 00:10:47.494 align:middle line:10%
to get to this place, to
acclimate to the elevations.

00:10:47.494 --> 00:10:49.160 align:middle line:84%
And the only way to
get up to this place

00:10:49.160 --> 00:10:51.650 align:middle line:84%
was through the local
animals, the yak,

00:10:51.650 --> 00:10:54.080 align:middle line:84%
that were available to
us because there just

00:10:54.080 --> 00:10:56.840 align:middle line:84%
was no way to get a
vehicle up to where

00:10:56.840 --> 00:10:58.970 align:middle line:90%
this particular monastery is.

00:10:58.970 --> 00:11:02.600 align:middle line:84%
But it was worth it because
when we got to this place,

00:11:02.600 --> 00:11:04.850 align:middle line:84%
I had the opportunity to
interact with the people,

00:11:04.850 --> 00:11:08.180 align:middle line:84%
with the monks and the nuns
and the abbots that were here.

00:11:08.180 --> 00:11:12.196 align:middle line:84%
And I asked them a question that
I asked everywhere that I went.

00:11:12.196 --> 00:11:16.610 align:middle line:84%
And the question was
simply this, in this place,

00:11:16.610 --> 00:11:20.390 align:middle line:84%
do you have a repository
of the knowledge that

00:11:20.390 --> 00:11:23.810 align:middle line:84%
has been accumulated over
hundreds or thousands of years?

00:11:23.810 --> 00:11:27.710 align:middle line:84%
Do you have a library that
we can see that records

00:11:27.710 --> 00:11:30.140 align:middle line:84%
what you have come to
understand about this world

00:11:30.140 --> 00:11:34.040 align:middle line:84%
and how you answer the
question, who am I?

00:11:34.040 --> 00:11:37.100 align:middle line:84%
Well, people in this monastery
didn't have much company

00:11:37.100 --> 00:11:38.840 align:middle line:84%
and they were really
happy to see us

00:11:38.840 --> 00:11:42.710 align:middle line:84%
and they opened the door
to one of their monasteries

00:11:42.710 --> 00:11:45.020 align:middle line:84%
and gave us access
into a library.

00:11:45.020 --> 00:11:49.110 align:middle line:84%
And to get to that library
was an experience unto itself.

00:11:49.110 --> 00:11:50.720 align:middle line:10%
We had to walk
down the corridors

00:11:50.720 --> 00:11:53.720 align:middle line:10%
of 30-foot tall
Buddhas of compassion,

00:11:53.720 --> 00:11:58.420 align:middle line:10%
past the magnificent prayer
wheels that we rotate,

00:11:58.420 --> 00:12:00.420 align:middle line:10%
and as they rotate,
the prayers inside

00:12:00.420 --> 00:12:01.640 align:middle line:10%
are released into the world.

00:12:01.640 --> 00:12:03.230 align:middle line:90%
This is their custom.

00:12:03.230 --> 00:12:05.960 align:middle line:84%
And it is this
custom that allows

00:12:05.960 --> 00:12:09.470 align:middle line:84%
us to move into their
world and to understand

00:12:09.470 --> 00:12:12.020 align:middle line:84%
what it is that they
have come to understand.

00:12:12.020 --> 00:12:14.090 align:middle line:84%
Well, the library
that they took us to,

00:12:14.090 --> 00:12:16.130 align:middle line:90%
this is a Tibetan library.

00:12:16.130 --> 00:12:18.040 align:middle line:90%
It's three stories tall.

00:12:18.040 --> 00:12:19.550 align:middle line:90%
It's only about 12 feet wide.

00:12:19.550 --> 00:12:22.380 align:middle line:84%
It's a very tall room
but very, very narrow.

00:12:22.380 --> 00:12:24.750 align:middle line:90%
It's 1,500 years old.

00:12:24.750 --> 00:12:29.900 align:middle line:84%
For 1,500 years, the wisdom,
the cumulative wisdom

00:12:29.900 --> 00:12:34.222 align:middle line:84%
of this tradition has been
accumulated in this library.

00:12:34.222 --> 00:12:35.680 align:middle line:84%
This is what their
books look like.

00:12:35.680 --> 00:12:39.850 align:middle line:84%
They're loose papers that are
sandwiched between the covers.

00:12:39.850 --> 00:12:43.170 align:middle line:84%
But the thing is, the
wisdom that's in the books

00:12:43.170 --> 00:12:46.350 align:middle line:84%
is older than the paper
that they're written on.

00:12:46.350 --> 00:12:50.910 align:middle line:84%
The wisdom originated before
paper was ever even invented.

00:12:50.910 --> 00:12:54.780 align:middle line:84%
And we find this wisdom on the
cuneiform text of our past,

00:12:54.780 --> 00:12:58.170 align:middle line:84%
on the Sanskrit and the
Tibetan stone texts.

00:12:58.170 --> 00:13:01.880 align:middle line:84%
And it's this wisdom that is at
the core of the major religions

00:13:01.880 --> 00:13:02.680 align:middle line:90%
of the world.

00:13:02.680 --> 00:13:06.150 align:middle line:84%
The Hebraic traditions, the
Tibetan Buddhist traditions,

00:13:06.150 --> 00:13:08.470 align:middle line:84%
the traditional
Buddhist traditions.

00:13:08.470 --> 00:13:11.790 align:middle line:84%
We find it at the basis
of the Hindu traditions,

00:13:11.790 --> 00:13:13.680 align:middle line:84%
at the basis of
the pre-Christian

00:13:13.680 --> 00:13:17.640 align:middle line:84%
and the Christian traditions,
the Old and the New Testament.

00:13:17.640 --> 00:13:22.600 align:middle line:84%
And it's in places like this,
that are isolated and remote,

00:13:22.600 --> 00:13:26.420 align:middle line:84%
that I've had the opportunity
to be with the people that

00:13:26.420 --> 00:13:29.480 align:middle line:84%
live the traditions that
are in the libraries

00:13:29.480 --> 00:13:33.920 align:middle line:84%
with the monks, the nuns,
the abbots of these places,

00:13:33.920 --> 00:13:37.140 align:middle line:84%
and in other parts of the world
with the shaman in Bolivia

00:13:37.140 --> 00:13:40.334 align:middle line:84%
and in southern Peru,
and in the Yucatan.

00:13:40.334 --> 00:13:41.750 align:middle line:84%
And I've had the
opportunity to be

00:13:41.750 --> 00:13:45.440 align:middle line:84%
with the women, the women in
southern Peru, for example,

00:13:45.440 --> 00:13:47.180 align:middle line:84%
in the Andes Mountains
who were anchoring

00:13:47.180 --> 00:13:50.810 align:middle line:84%
this powerful feminine wisdom
that is resurging in the world

00:13:50.810 --> 00:13:51.890 align:middle line:90%
right now.

00:13:51.890 --> 00:13:53.390 align:middle line:84%
And the point of
all this, the point

00:13:53.390 --> 00:13:56.150 align:middle line:84%
of me sharing all
this with you, is

00:13:56.150 --> 00:14:01.400 align:middle line:84%
that for 5,000 years,
our indigenous ancestors,

00:14:01.400 --> 00:14:04.340 align:middle line:84%
they've asked themselves
the question, who am I?

00:14:04.340 --> 00:14:07.940 align:middle line:84%
And they answered the
question for themselves

00:14:07.940 --> 00:14:10.160 align:middle line:84%
in a way that made
sense to them?

00:14:10.160 --> 00:14:14.900 align:middle line:84%
It wasn't science but it
made sense to the time

00:14:14.900 --> 00:14:17.030 align:middle line:84%
and to the people
in their world.

00:14:17.030 --> 00:14:19.550 align:middle line:84%
It explained what they
saw in the heavens.

00:14:19.550 --> 00:14:21.740 align:middle line:84%
It explained what happened
within their bodies

00:14:21.740 --> 00:14:23.420 align:middle line:90%
and between people.

00:14:23.420 --> 00:14:25.940 align:middle line:84%
And what's really
fascinating to me right now

00:14:25.940 --> 00:14:28.550 align:middle line:84%
is that, in many instances,
the new discoveries

00:14:28.550 --> 00:14:31.760 align:middle line:84%
of modern science
actually parallel

00:14:31.760 --> 00:14:34.190 align:middle line:84%
the wisdom of our most
ancient and cherished

00:14:34.190 --> 00:14:36.480 align:middle line:90%
spiritual traditions.

00:14:36.480 --> 00:14:40.790 align:middle line:10%
So for 5,000 years, our
ancestors have done just that.

00:14:40.790 --> 00:14:45.770 align:middle line:84%
They've asked, who am I and
they answered it for themselves.

00:14:45.770 --> 00:14:50.450 align:middle line:84%
We live in the modern world
of science and science

00:14:50.450 --> 00:14:53.150 align:middle line:84%
is a relatively young way
of thinking about the world.

00:14:53.150 --> 00:14:56.450 align:middle line:84%
You know, science is
only about 300 years old.

00:14:56.450 --> 00:14:59.390 align:middle line:10%
We say that science
began in the 1700s

00:14:59.390 --> 00:15:01.970 align:middle line:10%
when Isaac Newton formulated
the laws of physics

00:15:01.970 --> 00:15:05.240 align:middle line:10%
and he formalized
them in his textbooks.

00:15:05.240 --> 00:15:08.450 align:middle line:84%
So for 300 years,
science has been

00:15:08.450 --> 00:15:11.000 align:middle line:84%
trying to answer
the same questions

00:15:11.000 --> 00:15:14.000 align:middle line:84%
that our indigenous ancestors
have tried to answer.

00:15:14.000 --> 00:15:19.310 align:middle line:84%
For 300 years, science has
asked the question, who are we?

00:15:19.310 --> 00:15:22.760 align:middle line:84%
And the way that science
answers this question, they say,

00:15:22.760 --> 00:15:25.430 align:middle line:90%
we can't answer it directly.

00:15:25.430 --> 00:15:29.570 align:middle line:84%
First we must ask
six sub-questions.

00:15:29.570 --> 00:15:33.480 align:middle line:84%
These are called the perennial
questions of science.

00:15:33.480 --> 00:15:36.500 align:middle line:84%
When we ask the
question, who are we,

00:15:36.500 --> 00:15:38.720 align:middle line:84%
science says to
answer that question

00:15:38.720 --> 00:15:41.990 align:middle line:84%
we must first answer the
six perennial questions

00:15:41.990 --> 00:15:44.832 align:middle line:84%
and I'm going to share
them with you in this chart

00:15:44.832 --> 00:15:46.040 align:middle line:90%
that you're seeing right now.

00:15:46.040 --> 00:15:48.610 align:middle line:90%
This is an inverted pyramid.

00:15:48.610 --> 00:15:50.677 align:middle line:10%
And at the bottom
of the pyramid,

00:15:50.677 --> 00:15:52.260 align:middle line:10%
the point at the
bottom of the pyramid

00:15:52.260 --> 00:15:55.850 align:middle line:10%
is where the first of our
perennial questions is listed.

00:15:55.850 --> 00:15:57.750 align:middle line:10%
It is the most
fundamental question.

00:15:57.750 --> 00:16:00.840 align:middle line:84%
It's one that we're going to
explore throughout this series.

00:16:00.840 --> 00:16:03.240 align:middle line:84%
The question is, what
is the origin of life?

00:16:03.240 --> 00:16:05.070 align:middle line:90%
Where does life come from?

00:16:05.070 --> 00:16:07.710 align:middle line:10%
And I can see why that would
be a foundational scientific

00:16:07.710 --> 00:16:09.130 align:middle line:10%
question.

00:16:09.130 --> 00:16:12.480 align:middle line:10%
And the second question
is fascinating to me.

00:16:12.480 --> 00:16:16.050 align:middle line:10%
It is the question of where
does human life come from?

00:16:16.050 --> 00:16:18.030 align:middle line:84%
And it is asked
the way that it is

00:16:18.030 --> 00:16:21.120 align:middle line:84%
because what if human life
does not come from where

00:16:21.120 --> 00:16:22.680 align:middle line:90%
all other life comes from?

00:16:22.680 --> 00:16:24.390 align:middle line:10%
It's a fascinating
question and it's one

00:16:24.390 --> 00:16:27.760 align:middle line:10%
that we will explore throughout
this series, as well.

00:16:27.760 --> 00:16:30.450 align:middle line:10%
The third question is
about relationships.

00:16:30.450 --> 00:16:33.450 align:middle line:10%
What is our relationship
to our bodies?

00:16:33.450 --> 00:16:37.620 align:middle line:84%
Are we separate from our bodies
and powerless to do anything

00:16:37.620 --> 00:16:40.050 align:middle line:84%
when we see things happening,
illness and disease,

00:16:40.050 --> 00:16:43.380 align:middle line:84%
within our bodies, or
are we somehow empowered

00:16:43.380 --> 00:16:46.780 align:middle line:84%
to participate and influence
what happens in our bodies?

00:16:46.780 --> 00:16:49.230 align:middle line:84%
And I'm using those
words very consciously

00:16:49.230 --> 00:16:52.380 align:middle line:84%
because it's not about
control and manipulation.

00:16:52.380 --> 00:16:54.000 align:middle line:90%
It's about influence.

00:16:54.000 --> 00:16:55.860 align:middle line:10%
Do we have the
power to influence

00:16:55.860 --> 00:16:58.200 align:middle line:10%
what happens at
the cellular level

00:16:58.200 --> 00:17:01.680 align:middle line:10%
or even deeper at the
genetic level or even deeper

00:17:01.680 --> 00:17:03.990 align:middle line:10%
at the energetic level?

00:17:03.990 --> 00:17:07.140 align:middle line:10%
The next question, the next
of our perennial questions,

00:17:07.140 --> 00:17:11.065 align:middle line:10%
is what is our relationship to
the world beyond our bodies?

00:17:11.065 --> 00:17:13.170 align:middle line:84%
And the question
is very similar.

00:17:13.170 --> 00:17:15.119 align:middle line:84%
Are we connected
or are we separate?

00:17:15.119 --> 00:17:18.599 align:middle line:84%
Are we empowered to
participate and influence

00:17:18.599 --> 00:17:22.780 align:middle line:84%
what happens in the
workplace, with our families,

00:17:22.780 --> 00:17:26.020 align:middle line:84%
with our jobs, with our careers,
and even between nations?

00:17:26.020 --> 00:17:28.830 align:middle line:84%
Or are we powerless to do
anything and we just sit

00:17:28.830 --> 00:17:31.500 align:middle line:84%
and watch things happen
for no apparent reason

00:17:31.500 --> 00:17:35.160 align:middle line:84%
feeling helpless and powerless
to do anything about it?

00:17:35.160 --> 00:17:40.080 align:middle line:10%
The next question is what is
our relationship to the past?

00:17:40.080 --> 00:17:43.960 align:middle line:10%
Is the past linear as we
have been led to believe

00:17:43.960 --> 00:17:48.310 align:middle line:10%
and been taught in schools
for the last 300 years?

00:17:48.310 --> 00:17:50.075 align:middle line:90%
Is the past linear?

00:17:50.075 --> 00:17:53.820 align:middle line:84%
Did civilization
begin 5,000 years ago

00:17:53.820 --> 00:17:57.780 align:middle line:84%
and progress in a linear
fashion to the pinnacle

00:17:57.780 --> 00:17:59.580 align:middle line:84%
of sophistication
that we see today?

00:17:59.580 --> 00:18:02.120 align:middle line:84%
Are we the only ones that
have developed the technology

00:18:02.120 --> 00:18:05.400 align:middle line:84%
that we have today or
have there been others?

00:18:05.400 --> 00:18:07.560 align:middle line:90%
Is civilization cyclic?

00:18:07.560 --> 00:18:09.900 align:middle line:10%
That's the question
that science is asking.

00:18:09.900 --> 00:18:13.710 align:middle line:10%
The next question, and
perhaps the most fundamental

00:18:13.710 --> 00:18:19.540 align:middle line:10%
beyond the origin of life, is
what is the rule of nature?

00:18:19.540 --> 00:18:21.840 align:middle line:90%
We are all part of nature.

00:18:21.840 --> 00:18:24.880 align:middle line:84%
Nature is the
foundation of our lives.

00:18:24.880 --> 00:18:27.480 align:middle line:84%
What is the fundamental
rule of nature?

00:18:27.480 --> 00:18:32.370 align:middle line:84%
Is it a rule based in
struggle and conflict,

00:18:32.370 --> 00:18:34.770 align:middle line:84%
as Charles Darwin
asked us to believe,

00:18:34.770 --> 00:18:36.720 align:middle line:84%
or is there something
else happening?

00:18:36.720 --> 00:18:39.510 align:middle line:84%
Is nature actually
based in cooperation?

00:18:39.510 --> 00:18:41.910 align:middle line:10%
These are the six
perennial questions.

00:18:41.910 --> 00:18:45.570 align:middle line:10%
If you were raised in the
West and if you were educated

00:18:45.570 --> 00:18:49.200 align:middle line:10%
in the West in the
last 150 years,

00:18:49.200 --> 00:18:53.700 align:middle line:10%
you, as I, have been
imbued with a story.

00:18:53.700 --> 00:18:57.670 align:middle line:84%
And it is a scientific story
that says the following.

00:18:57.670 --> 00:19:00.600 align:middle line:10%
It says that the origin of
life is completely random.

00:19:00.600 --> 00:19:03.780 align:middle line:84%
The origin of human life
is completely random.

00:19:03.780 --> 00:19:05.400 align:middle line:84%
Our relationship to
our bodies, we're

00:19:05.400 --> 00:19:07.860 align:middle line:84%
told that we are
separate from our bodies

00:19:07.860 --> 00:19:11.340 align:middle line:84%
and pretty much
powerless to do anything

00:19:11.340 --> 00:19:14.040 align:middle line:84%
when it comes to the condition
of healing in our bodies

00:19:14.040 --> 00:19:16.530 align:middle line:84%
and that's why we
need a third party.

00:19:16.530 --> 00:19:18.150 align:middle line:84%
That's why we need
the intervention

00:19:18.150 --> 00:19:20.280 align:middle line:84%
of a medical
professional to help us

00:19:20.280 --> 00:19:26.190 align:middle line:84%
because we have that experience,
because we have that belief.

00:19:26.190 --> 00:19:28.714 align:middle line:84%
The relationship to
the world around us?

00:19:28.714 --> 00:19:29.880 align:middle line:90%
Pretty much the same answer.

00:19:29.880 --> 00:19:32.400 align:middle line:10%
We've been led to believe that
we're separate from our world

00:19:32.400 --> 00:19:35.306 align:middle line:10%
and pretty much powerless
when it comes to influencing

00:19:35.306 --> 00:19:36.930 align:middle line:10%
the peace and
cooperation, whether it's

00:19:36.930 --> 00:19:40.920 align:middle line:10%
in our families or our
communities or between nations.

00:19:40.920 --> 00:19:42.600 align:middle line:10%
Our relationship
to our past-- we

00:19:42.600 --> 00:19:45.240 align:middle line:10%
have been taught that
civilization happened once.

00:19:45.240 --> 00:19:48.690 align:middle line:84%
It began 5,000 years ago
and we are the pinnacle

00:19:48.690 --> 00:19:50.400 align:middle line:90%
of that sophistication.

00:19:50.400 --> 00:19:53.040 align:middle line:10%
And we have been
taught number six,

00:19:53.040 --> 00:19:56.070 align:middle line:10%
that nature, the
fundamental rule of nature

00:19:56.070 --> 00:20:00.030 align:middle line:10%
is actually based upon
competition, conflict,

00:20:00.030 --> 00:20:01.590 align:middle line:10%
and struggle.

00:20:01.590 --> 00:20:07.350 align:middle line:84%
These are the principles of
the world that we see today.

00:20:07.350 --> 00:20:11.940 align:middle line:84%
New discoveries have now
overturned every single one

00:20:11.940 --> 00:20:13.694 align:middle line:90%
of these beliefs.

00:20:13.694 --> 00:20:15.360 align:middle line:10%
Every single one of
the beliefs that you

00:20:15.360 --> 00:20:17.370 align:middle line:10%
see on the left-hand
side of your screen

00:20:17.370 --> 00:20:19.980 align:middle line:10%
is now proven in
peer-reviewed science

00:20:19.980 --> 00:20:22.410 align:middle line:10%
to be scientifically false.

00:20:22.410 --> 00:20:23.760 align:middle line:90%
So this isn't my opinion.

00:20:23.760 --> 00:20:24.640 align:middle line:90%
It's not my theory.

00:20:24.640 --> 00:20:25.980 align:middle line:90%
It's not my hypothesis.

00:20:25.980 --> 00:20:29.070 align:middle line:84%
This is based in
peer-reviewed science.

00:20:29.070 --> 00:20:32.880 align:middle line:84%
What we now know is that these
false assumptions of science

00:20:32.880 --> 00:20:35.790 align:middle line:84%
are at the root, the foundation
of many of the extremes

00:20:35.790 --> 00:20:38.910 align:middle line:84%
that we're seeing in our
lives and in our world today.

00:20:38.910 --> 00:20:41.040 align:middle line:84%
New discoveries
now are telling us

00:20:41.040 --> 00:20:43.320 align:middle line:84%
where we need to
shift our thinking.

00:20:43.320 --> 00:20:46.260 align:middle line:84%
Now, I've had people say
to me in the past, Greg,

00:20:46.260 --> 00:20:48.840 align:middle line:84%
maybe science didn't get
all these things right,

00:20:48.840 --> 00:20:50.525 align:middle line:84%
but science, it's
been pretty good.

00:20:50.525 --> 00:20:51.900 align:middle line:10%
I mean, it did
get us to the moon

00:20:51.900 --> 00:20:56.040 align:middle line:10%
and it has brought us
penicillin and vaccines.

00:20:56.040 --> 00:20:58.000 align:middle line:90%
Where do we go with this?

00:20:58.000 --> 00:20:59.700 align:middle line:84%
Why is it important
in our lives?

00:20:59.700 --> 00:21:01.800 align:middle line:84%
And I want to just take
a minute and share this

00:21:01.800 --> 00:21:04.020 align:middle line:84%
with you because when we
really understand this,

00:21:04.020 --> 00:21:05.790 align:middle line:90%
it's so powerful.

00:21:05.790 --> 00:21:07.560 align:middle line:84%
Many of the scientific
discoveries,

00:21:07.560 --> 00:21:11.980 align:middle line:84%
the false assumptions,
were made in the late 1800s

00:21:11.980 --> 00:21:15.690 align:middle line:84%
and the early 1900s,
precisely the time

00:21:15.690 --> 00:21:19.140 align:middle line:84%
when our society
was being developed.

00:21:19.140 --> 00:21:22.270 align:middle line:84%
So the fundamental
essence of our society,

00:21:22.270 --> 00:21:24.660 align:middle line:84%
our economic system, our
corporate system, the way

00:21:24.660 --> 00:21:27.550 align:middle line:84%
we deal with natural resources,
the way we share resources,

00:21:27.550 --> 00:21:32.110 align:middle line:84%
like food and water, energy and
medicine, all of these things,

00:21:32.110 --> 00:21:33.930 align:middle line:84%
they are based in
the ideas that were

00:21:33.930 --> 00:21:38.550 align:middle line:84%
embraced as scientific in the
late 1800s and early 1900s.

00:21:38.550 --> 00:21:41.167 align:middle line:84%
And even though we now know
that many of them are false,

00:21:41.167 --> 00:21:42.750 align:middle line:84%
we're still living
in the system where

00:21:42.750 --> 00:21:44.340 align:middle line:90%
those principles are in place.

00:21:44.340 --> 00:21:47.160 align:middle line:10%
They are unsustainable
because they're

00:21:47.160 --> 00:21:49.780 align:middle line:10%
based in false assumptions.

00:21:49.780 --> 00:21:52.590 align:middle line:84%
So what do the new
discoveries now tell us?

00:21:52.590 --> 00:21:55.890 align:middle line:84%
The best science of the
20th, now the 21st century,

00:21:55.890 --> 00:21:58.740 align:middle line:84%
it's telling us, number
one, the origin of life,

00:21:58.740 --> 00:21:59.970 align:middle line:90%
it's not random.

00:21:59.970 --> 00:22:02.040 align:middle line:84%
Physical evidence
is telling us this.

00:22:02.040 --> 00:22:05.220 align:middle line:84%
The origin of human life
is definitely not random.

00:22:05.220 --> 00:22:07.890 align:middle line:84%
The DNA evidence
is telling us this.

00:22:07.890 --> 00:22:09.860 align:middle line:84%
We're going to explore
this in future episodes

00:22:09.860 --> 00:22:12.420 align:middle line:90%
in this program, this series.

00:22:12.420 --> 00:22:14.450 align:middle line:90%
Our relationship to our body?

00:22:14.450 --> 00:22:17.310 align:middle line:84%
Science is telling us that we
are deeply, deeply connected.

00:22:17.310 --> 00:22:19.910 align:middle line:84%
Our thoughts, feelings,
emotions, and beliefs

00:22:19.910 --> 00:22:22.290 align:middle line:84%
trigger the chemistry
in our brain

00:22:22.290 --> 00:22:26.040 align:middle line:84%
and in our heart that
releases the healing

00:22:26.040 --> 00:22:29.040 align:middle line:84%
hormones, the anti-aging
hormones, the powerful immune

00:22:29.040 --> 00:22:30.950 align:middle line:90%
response into our bodies.

00:22:30.950 --> 00:22:32.370 align:middle line:84%
And the beauty of
that is that we

00:22:32.370 --> 00:22:35.190 align:middle line:84%
get to choose the thoughts,
feelings, emotions and beliefs

00:22:35.190 --> 00:22:36.570 align:middle line:90%
that do the triggering.

00:22:36.570 --> 00:22:40.470 align:middle line:84%
So we are deeply, deeply
ingrained in this system.

00:22:40.470 --> 00:22:42.020 align:middle line:90%
Our relationship to the world?

00:22:42.020 --> 00:22:46.500 align:middle line:84%
What we now know is that
civilization is cyclic.

00:22:46.500 --> 00:22:49.020 align:middle line:84%
The 5,000 years that
we've been studying

00:22:49.020 --> 00:22:50.640 align:middle line:84%
as the history of
the world, that's

00:22:50.640 --> 00:22:53.040 align:middle line:84%
only the history of
the most recent cycle.

00:22:53.040 --> 00:22:56.020 align:middle line:84%
There was a 5,000-year cycle
before that and one before

00:22:56.020 --> 00:22:56.820 align:middle line:90%
that.

00:22:56.820 --> 00:22:59.100 align:middle line:84%
We're not sure how
far back that goes.

00:22:59.100 --> 00:23:01.140 align:middle line:90%
The fundamental rule of nature?

00:23:01.140 --> 00:23:05.670 align:middle line:84%
We now know that nature
is based upon a principle

00:23:05.670 --> 00:23:09.660 align:middle line:84%
of cooperation, not
conflict, in what biologists

00:23:09.660 --> 00:23:13.100 align:middle line:90%
call mutual aid not struggle.

00:23:13.100 --> 00:23:16.570 align:middle line:84%
Now, this isn't denying that
struggle and conflict happen.

00:23:16.570 --> 00:23:17.570 align:middle line:90%
We all see it.

00:23:17.570 --> 00:23:22.080 align:middle line:84%
But here's the deal, the more
struggle and conflict we see,

00:23:22.080 --> 00:23:24.840 align:middle line:84%
that tells us how
far we have strayed

00:23:24.840 --> 00:23:29.760 align:middle line:84%
as individuals or as nations
from the truest nature,

00:23:29.760 --> 00:23:33.850 align:middle line:84%
the most fundamental principle
of the natural world.

00:23:33.850 --> 00:23:38.220 align:middle line:84%
So now, 150 years of
this scientific thinking

00:23:38.220 --> 00:23:41.250 align:middle line:84%
is changing because these
new discoveries tell us

00:23:41.250 --> 00:23:43.230 align:middle line:90%
they must change.

00:23:43.230 --> 00:23:45.990 align:middle line:90%
So we're moving to a new story.

00:23:45.990 --> 00:23:48.480 align:middle line:84%
We're moving from a
story of separation

00:23:48.480 --> 00:23:50.760 align:middle line:90%
to a story of connection.

00:23:50.760 --> 00:23:54.750 align:middle line:10%
We're moving from a story
of competition and conflict,

00:23:54.750 --> 00:23:58.320 align:middle line:10%
based in Darwin's ideas
from 150 years ago,

00:23:58.320 --> 00:24:03.540 align:middle line:10%
to a new story that's based
upon cooperation and mutual aid

00:24:03.540 --> 00:24:07.170 align:middle line:10%
>> Darwin took us
forward to a hilltop,

00:24:07.170 --> 00:24:09.960 align:middle line:10%
from where we could look back
and see the way from which we

00:24:09.960 --> 00:24:10.760 align:middle line:10%
came.

00:24:10.760 --> 00:24:13.620 align:middle line:10%
But for this insight
and for this knowledge,

00:24:13.620 --> 00:24:18.326 align:middle line:10%
we must abandon our faith in
the pleasant poetry of Genesis.

00:24:18.326 --> 00:24:21.000 align:middle line:10%
>> We must not abandon fate.

00:24:21.000 --> 00:24:23.095 align:middle line:10%
Fate is the most
important thing.

00:24:23.095 --> 00:24:26.350 align:middle line:10%
>> Then why did God plague
us with the power to think?

00:24:26.350 --> 00:24:30.172 align:middle line:10%
Mr. Brady, why do you deny
the one faculty of man

00:24:30.172 --> 00:24:34.120 align:middle line:10%
that raises him above the
other creatures of the Earth?

00:24:34.120 --> 00:24:38.340 align:middle line:84%
>> This is important for us
right now because of our time

00:24:38.340 --> 00:24:39.990 align:middle line:90%
of extremes.

00:24:39.990 --> 00:24:42.360 align:middle line:84%
The world is changing,
and we're trying

00:24:42.360 --> 00:24:45.150 align:middle line:84%
to solve the problems of
our past in the same ways

00:24:45.150 --> 00:24:48.960 align:middle line:84%
that we always have in the
past and it's not working.

00:24:48.960 --> 00:24:52.110 align:middle line:84%
It's not working because we
are now a globalized society

00:24:52.110 --> 00:24:56.220 align:middle line:84%
and that globalization
has pushed our beliefs

00:24:56.220 --> 00:24:59.070 align:middle line:84%
and what we think is true about
ourselves and one another,

00:24:59.070 --> 00:25:03.240 align:middle line:84%
it's pushed it to the
very edge of what we now

00:25:03.240 --> 00:25:05.560 align:middle line:90%
understand is true.

00:25:05.560 --> 00:25:08.640 align:middle line:84%
And the only things that
are breaking down around us

00:25:08.640 --> 00:25:10.575 align:middle line:84%
are the unsustainable
ways of thinking,

00:25:10.575 --> 00:25:14.520 align:middle line:84%
the unsustainable
solutions of separation,

00:25:14.520 --> 00:25:16.570 align:middle line:90%
competition, and conflict.

00:25:16.570 --> 00:25:19.110 align:middle line:84%
So what does this mean
for you in your life?

00:25:19.110 --> 00:25:22.350 align:middle line:84%
You know, to get wherever you
are in your life right now,

00:25:22.350 --> 00:25:25.710 align:middle line:84%
you've had to create your own
ideas and your own beliefs.

00:25:25.710 --> 00:25:27.990 align:middle line:84%
And what I'm going to
invite you to do is this.

00:25:27.990 --> 00:25:30.810 align:middle line:84%
Take everything that
you've ever held true

00:25:30.810 --> 00:25:33.480 align:middle line:84%
and been taught and conditioned
to believe about yourself

00:25:33.480 --> 00:25:37.620 align:middle line:84%
and your world and put that into
a file folder called existing

00:25:37.620 --> 00:25:39.540 align:middle line:90%
beliefs in your mind, OK?

00:25:39.540 --> 00:25:41.040 align:middle line:84%
Because it's worked
for you and it's

00:25:41.040 --> 00:25:43.410 align:middle line:84%
gotten you to where
you are right now.

00:25:43.410 --> 00:25:46.770 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to invite you now to
create a second file folder,

00:25:46.770 --> 00:25:49.590 align:middle line:84%
and if you'll just
label it possibilities.

00:25:49.590 --> 00:25:52.560 align:middle line:84%
And into that file
folder of possibilities,

00:25:52.560 --> 00:25:54.270 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to invite
you to place all

00:25:54.270 --> 00:25:56.430 align:middle line:84%
of these new
discoveries, the fact,

00:25:56.430 --> 00:25:58.920 align:middle line:84%
the scientific fact,
that the origin of life,

00:25:58.920 --> 00:25:59.910 align:middle line:90%
it's not random.

00:25:59.910 --> 00:26:01.250 align:middle line:90%
Human life is not random.

00:26:01.250 --> 00:26:03.030 align:middle line:84%
That we're deeply
connected to our bodies.

00:26:03.030 --> 00:26:05.100 align:middle line:84%
We're deeply connected
to the world.

00:26:05.100 --> 00:26:07.140 align:middle line:84%
That civilization
is cyclic and we've

00:26:07.140 --> 00:26:10.650 align:middle line:84%
had advanced technological
civilizations here

00:26:10.650 --> 00:26:13.230 align:middle line:90%
multiple times in the past.

00:26:13.230 --> 00:26:17.790 align:middle line:84%
And the fact that nature, the
fundamental rule of nature

00:26:17.790 --> 00:26:21.540 align:middle line:84%
is based upon cooperation
and mutual aid

00:26:21.540 --> 00:26:23.610 align:middle line:90%
not survival of the strongest.

00:26:23.610 --> 00:26:26.490 align:middle line:84%
And those are Darwin's
actual words from his book,

00:26:26.490 --> 00:26:29.430 align:middle line:84%
survival of the strongest,
later translated

00:26:29.430 --> 00:26:31.830 align:middle line:90%
into survival of the fittest.

00:26:31.830 --> 00:26:35.520 align:middle line:84%
Nature is not based upon
survival of the strongest.

00:26:35.520 --> 00:26:40.050 align:middle line:84%
So when you find yourself
challenged in your world

00:26:40.050 --> 00:26:43.470 align:middle line:84%
or when you find
yourself asked to support

00:26:43.470 --> 00:26:47.910 align:middle line:84%
other people in positions of
power, who are being asked

00:26:47.910 --> 00:26:50.460 align:middle line:84%
to make decisions
on your behalf,

00:26:50.460 --> 00:26:52.830 align:middle line:84%
then you can ask
yourself the question,

00:26:52.830 --> 00:26:55.650 align:middle line:84%
are they using the file
folder of the old ideas or

00:26:55.650 --> 00:26:58.840 align:middle line:84%
are they using the file folder
of the new possibilities?

00:26:58.840 --> 00:27:01.410 align:middle line:84%
And when those old
ideas no longer work

00:27:01.410 --> 00:27:03.720 align:middle line:84%
and they begin to break
down, rather than struggle

00:27:03.720 --> 00:27:06.630 align:middle line:84%
in your personal life,
let that folder go.

00:27:06.630 --> 00:27:09.600 align:middle line:84%
Open up that new file
folder of possibilities

00:27:09.600 --> 00:27:15.630 align:middle line:84%
and you will be amazed at how
solutions flow into your life,

00:27:15.630 --> 00:27:20.250 align:middle line:84%
and how situations change very,
very quickly when we solve them

00:27:20.250 --> 00:27:24.480 align:middle line:84%
by applying natural principles
based in the harmony of what

00:27:24.480 --> 00:27:27.690 align:middle line:90%
is real and true in our world.

00:27:27.690 --> 00:27:29.640 align:middle line:84%
In our next segment,
we're going to zero

00:27:29.640 --> 00:27:31.800 align:middle line:84%
in on specific
discoveries that will

00:27:31.800 --> 00:27:35.400 align:middle line:84%
overturn that century and a
half of scientific thinking.

00:27:35.400 --> 00:27:38.700 align:middle line:84%
And we'll also see how
these discoveries parallel

00:27:38.700 --> 00:27:42.310 align:middle line:84%
some of our most ancient and
cherished spiritual traditions

00:27:42.310 --> 00:27:44.260 align:middle line:90%
and what they mean for us today.

00:27:44.260 --> 00:27:46.950 align:middle line:84%
So I want to thank you for
joining me for this program

00:27:46.950 --> 00:27:48.600 align:middle line:84%
and be sure and
tune in for our next
