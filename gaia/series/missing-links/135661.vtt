>>GREGG BRADEN: My
name is Gregg Braden.

00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:29.620 align:middle line:84%
I'd like to welcome you to
this very special presentation

00:00:29.620 --> 00:00:33.310 align:middle line:84%
of "Missing Links," the deep
truth of our origin, history,

00:00:33.310 --> 00:00:34.990 align:middle line:90%
destiny, and fate.

00:00:34.990 --> 00:00:37.060 align:middle line:84%
And the last episode,
we discovered

00:00:37.060 --> 00:00:40.420 align:middle line:84%
that the scientific
evidence for civilizations

00:00:40.420 --> 00:00:43.930 align:middle line:84%
simply don't fit the traditional
timeline for our past.

00:00:43.930 --> 00:00:46.270 align:middle line:10%
From Caral, Peru,
and the Great Sphinx

00:00:46.270 --> 00:00:48.850 align:middle line:10%
in Egypt to Turkey's
Gobekli Tepe

00:00:48.850 --> 00:00:51.970 align:middle line:10%
now dated into the
last ice age, we

00:00:51.970 --> 00:00:56.320 align:middle line:10%
saw examples of evidence that
was once discounted by science,

00:00:56.320 --> 00:00:59.140 align:middle line:10%
but now it's
scientifically accepted.

00:00:59.140 --> 00:01:02.160 align:middle line:84%
Well, in this episode, I'm
inviting you on a journey.

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:03.910 align:middle line:84%
And it's a journey
that goes beyond what's

00:01:03.910 --> 00:01:06.040 align:middle line:84%
accepted by conventional
science today,

00:01:06.040 --> 00:01:09.250 align:middle line:84%
the evidence that turns
history upside down.

00:01:09.250 --> 00:01:10.900 align:middle line:84%
And, in some
respects, it's going

00:01:10.900 --> 00:01:12.550 align:middle line:90%
to sound like science fiction.

00:01:12.550 --> 00:01:14.770 align:middle line:84%
The thing is, while these
discoveries may sound

00:01:14.770 --> 00:01:15.902 align:middle line:90%
like fiction, they're not.

00:01:15.902 --> 00:01:17.020 align:middle line:90%
They're real.

00:01:17.020 --> 00:01:20.530 align:middle line:84%
And because they are real,
we have to make room for them

00:01:20.530 --> 00:01:22.900 align:middle line:90%
in the story of our past.

00:01:22.900 --> 00:01:27.190 align:middle line:84%
New dating techniques are
now revealing brand new clues

00:01:27.190 --> 00:01:28.480 align:middle line:90%
about the mystery of our past.

00:01:28.480 --> 00:01:33.280 align:middle line:84%
And they're also revealing
a new and entirely new class

00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:35.710 align:middle line:84%
of artifacts that we've
never seen before.

00:01:35.710 --> 00:01:39.550 align:middle line:84%
They're called OOP Arts,
which stands for Out

00:01:39.550 --> 00:01:41.260 align:middle line:90%
Of Place Artifacts.

00:01:41.260 --> 00:01:44.230 align:middle line:84%
So I want to talk to you
about Out Of Place Artifacts.

00:01:44.230 --> 00:01:45.160 align:middle line:90%
What are they?

00:01:45.160 --> 00:01:46.600 align:middle line:90%
What do they mean?

00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:50.920 align:middle line:84%
And what do they say
to us about our past?

00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:56.230 align:middle line:84%
The idea is that when we look
into the Earth, the deeper we

00:01:56.230 --> 00:02:00.295 align:middle line:84%
go into the Earth's crust, the
older the rock layers become.

00:02:00.295 --> 00:02:02.120 align:middle line:90%
It makes perfect sense.

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:04.030 align:middle line:84%
So the newer layers
are on top the.

00:02:04.030 --> 00:02:05.810 align:middle line:90%
Older layers are at the bottom.

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:07.660 align:middle line:84%
And the reason that
this is important

00:02:07.660 --> 00:02:11.590 align:middle line:84%
is because scientists use
this principle to help

00:02:11.590 --> 00:02:13.540 align:middle line:90%
determine the age of artifacts.

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:16.960 align:middle line:84%
When they find an artifact
deep in the Earth,

00:02:16.960 --> 00:02:19.990 align:middle line:84%
in a layer of coal, for
example, the thinking

00:02:19.990 --> 00:02:25.330 align:middle line:84%
is that the artifact had to
be in place when that coal was

00:02:25.330 --> 00:02:27.760 align:middle line:84%
being developed, and
in the case of coal,

00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:30.520 align:middle line:84%
that means hundreds of
thousands of years ago.

00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:32.200 align:middle line:90%
So this is important.

00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:37.300 align:middle line:84%
It was in 1700s and the 1800s
when technology brought us

00:02:37.300 --> 00:02:40.180 align:middle line:84%
to the point where we could
actually drill into the Earth.

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:42.880 align:middle line:84%
And it was through the drill
bits that were coming up

00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:46.530 align:middle line:84%
in the coal seams of the
Carolinas and Virginia

00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:49.090 align:middle line:84%
here in America and in
Russia and other parts

00:02:49.090 --> 00:02:52.690 align:middle line:84%
of the world-- all of
a sudden in these coal

00:02:52.690 --> 00:02:57.670 align:middle line:84%
seams the researchers began
finding and the engineers

00:02:57.670 --> 00:03:01.630 align:middle line:84%
began finding artifacts that
simply should not be existing

00:03:01.630 --> 00:03:03.430 align:middle line:90%
in those coal seams.

00:03:03.430 --> 00:03:06.220 align:middle line:84%
They're called Out
Of Place Artifacts

00:03:06.220 --> 00:03:09.850 align:middle line:84%
because they don't fit the
traditional timeline for what

00:03:09.850 --> 00:03:13.000 align:middle line:84%
should have been happening
in that layer of Earth

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:14.477 align:middle line:90%
at the time.

00:03:14.477 --> 00:03:16.810 align:middle line:84%
So I'm just going to share
with you a sampling of these,

00:03:16.810 --> 00:03:19.940 align:middle line:84%
because we could do an entire
program based only on Out

00:03:19.940 --> 00:03:21.970 align:middle line:90%
Of Place Artifacts.

00:03:21.970 --> 00:03:25.700 align:middle line:84%
But the point is they
begin to tell us a story.

00:03:25.700 --> 00:03:28.735 align:middle line:84%
So let's look at some of the
confirmed examples of Out

00:03:28.735 --> 00:03:30.610 align:middle line:90%
Of Place Artifacts.

00:03:30.610 --> 00:03:32.770 align:middle line:84%
And again, this is only
a sampling of discoveries

00:03:32.770 --> 00:03:34.190 align:middle line:90%
that are being made.

00:03:34.190 --> 00:03:36.970 align:middle line:84%
The first one I want
to talk about it to me

00:03:36.970 --> 00:03:38.830 align:middle line:90%
is one of the most profound.

00:03:38.830 --> 00:03:41.620 align:middle line:84%
It's called the
Antikythera machine.

00:03:41.620 --> 00:03:45.820 align:middle line:84%
It was actually discovered by
divers off the shore of Crete

00:03:45.820 --> 00:03:48.090 align:middle line:90%
in 1901.

00:03:48.090 --> 00:03:53.440 align:middle line:84%
1901, the divers were looking
for other kinds of artifacts,

00:03:53.440 --> 00:03:57.596 align:middle line:84%
and they found this encrusted
conglomerate of something

00:03:57.596 --> 00:03:58.720 align:middle line:90%
they had never seen before.

00:03:58.720 --> 00:04:01.330 align:middle line:90%
Now, bear in mind this is 1901.

00:04:01.330 --> 00:04:04.990 align:middle line:84%
This is the turn of centuries
ago-- not last century,

00:04:04.990 --> 00:04:06.820 align:middle line:90%
but the century before.

00:04:06.820 --> 00:04:08.320 align:middle line:84%
And when they
brought this artifact

00:04:08.320 --> 00:04:14.650 align:middle line:84%
to the surface, what they
saw encrusted in the shells

00:04:14.650 --> 00:04:17.980 align:middle line:84%
and in the sediment
that was there

00:04:17.980 --> 00:04:22.270 align:middle line:84%
were a series of gears,
very sophisticated gears,

00:04:22.270 --> 00:04:24.279 align:middle line:84%
in a way that had
never been seen before.

00:04:24.279 --> 00:04:26.320 align:middle line:84%
Well, they took this
artifact, they preserved it.

00:04:26.320 --> 00:04:28.690 align:middle line:90%
They couldn't explain it.

00:04:28.690 --> 00:04:31.380 align:middle line:10%
And it wasn't until X-rays
became a little bit more

00:04:31.380 --> 00:04:33.810 align:middle line:10%
sophisticated that
the exhale rays were

00:04:33.810 --> 00:04:36.390 align:middle line:10%
able to actually
penetrate the sediment

00:04:36.390 --> 00:04:40.040 align:middle line:10%
and revealed inside
something even more profound,

00:04:40.040 --> 00:04:44.220 align:middle line:10%
the really sophisticated
variable gears

00:04:44.220 --> 00:04:46.770 align:middle line:10%
that interlock with one
another in a way that had never

00:04:46.770 --> 00:04:49.470 align:middle line:10%
been seen in the world before.

00:04:49.470 --> 00:04:51.570 align:middle line:84%
The interesting thing
is that the artifact

00:04:51.570 --> 00:04:57.930 align:middle line:84%
was dated to about 80 BCE,
Before Common Era, which

00:04:57.930 --> 00:05:01.380 align:middle line:90%
means it's over 2000 years old.

00:05:01.380 --> 00:05:03.960 align:middle line:84%
So the question is,
over 2000 years ago,

00:05:03.960 --> 00:05:06.360 align:middle line:84%
number one, who
had the technology

00:05:06.360 --> 00:05:08.430 align:middle line:90%
to make this kind of gear?

00:05:08.430 --> 00:05:12.270 align:middle line:10%
Number two, who had the
technology to take these gears

00:05:12.270 --> 00:05:17.190 align:middle line:10%
and apply them in the machine
that is now being suspected

00:05:17.190 --> 00:05:21.900 align:middle line:10%
as an astronomical
device to help calculate

00:05:21.900 --> 00:05:24.240 align:middle line:10%
the movements of
stars and planets

00:05:24.240 --> 00:05:25.830 align:middle line:10%
in the heavens in
the way that we did

00:05:25.830 --> 00:05:29.020 align:middle line:10%
see until later in
the 20th century?

00:05:29.020 --> 00:05:32.215 align:middle line:10%
So this is an example of
an Out Of Place Artifact.

00:05:32.215 --> 00:05:33.090 align:middle line:90%
But there are others.

00:05:33.090 --> 00:05:37.770 align:middle line:84%
Now, I'm going to go from some
of the most recent, backward

00:05:37.770 --> 00:05:41.520 align:middle line:84%
in geologic time, just to give
you a sense of what scientists

00:05:41.520 --> 00:05:42.676 align:middle line:90%
are dealing with.

00:05:42.676 --> 00:05:45.600 align:middle line:84%
Because remember,
science is telling us

00:05:45.600 --> 00:05:47.850 align:middle line:84%
through that pyramid
of thinking that we

00:05:47.850 --> 00:05:50.250 align:middle line:84%
saw in an earlier
episode that civilization

00:05:50.250 --> 00:05:52.110 align:middle line:90%
is only 5,000 years old.

00:05:52.110 --> 00:05:55.720 align:middle line:84%
That's the problem when we
start finding things like this.

00:05:55.720 --> 00:05:58.080 align:middle line:84%
What you're looking at
on your screen right now

00:05:58.080 --> 00:06:03.180 align:middle line:84%
is a clay human figure that
was found in Nampa, Idaho.

00:06:03.180 --> 00:06:05.070 align:middle line:84%
It was discovered
by drilling a well.

00:06:05.070 --> 00:06:07.500 align:middle line:84%
It was a water
well 300 feet deep.

00:06:07.500 --> 00:06:11.850 align:middle line:84%
And that 300 feet placed the
drill into the geologic strata

00:06:11.850 --> 00:06:13.560 align:middle line:90%
that we call the Pleistocene.

00:06:13.560 --> 00:06:16.110 align:middle line:90%
So this is the Pleistocene Age.

00:06:16.110 --> 00:06:22.260 align:middle line:84%
That is about 1.2 million
years before present.

00:06:22.260 --> 00:06:24.600 align:middle line:84%
So just for
reference, humans only

00:06:24.600 --> 00:06:28.550 align:middle line:84%
appeared on Earth about
200,000 years ago,

00:06:28.550 --> 00:06:29.880 align:middle line:90%
is what we're finding.

00:06:29.880 --> 00:06:34.920 align:middle line:84%
So the question is, what is
this clay figurine, a little bit

00:06:34.920 --> 00:06:37.560 align:middle line:84%
larger than the size
of an American dime,

00:06:37.560 --> 00:06:40.830 align:middle line:84%
you're seeing for scale
on the screen-- what

00:06:40.830 --> 00:06:45.960 align:middle line:84%
is that figurine doing in
Pleistocene strata that's

00:06:45.960 --> 00:06:49.560 align:middle line:84%
now being dated at
1.2 million years?

00:06:49.560 --> 00:06:50.775 align:middle line:90%
Scientists can't answer that.

00:06:50.775 --> 00:06:53.757 align:middle line:84%
That is why it is an
Out Of Place Artifact.

00:06:53.757 --> 00:06:55.590 align:middle line:84%
Now we're going to go
back a little further,

00:06:55.590 --> 00:06:58.620 align:middle line:84%
and this is a particularly
fascinating artifact for me.

00:06:58.620 --> 00:07:01.230 align:middle line:84%
This was found in northern
Russia in Lebinsk.

00:07:01.230 --> 00:07:03.180 align:middle line:84%
And if you look
closely, what you're

00:07:03.180 --> 00:07:11.640 align:middle line:84%
seeing in this piece of rock is
what looks to be a microchip.

00:07:11.640 --> 00:07:15.150 align:middle line:84%
It's a microchip
that should not be

00:07:15.150 --> 00:07:20.070 align:middle line:84%
where it is because this rock
comes from an even older period

00:07:20.070 --> 00:07:21.390 align:middle line:90%
in geologic history.

00:07:21.390 --> 00:07:23.130 align:middle line:84%
It comes from the
Permian period.

00:07:23.130 --> 00:07:29.310 align:middle line:84%
That's around 225 to 250
million years before present.

00:07:29.310 --> 00:07:32.850 align:middle line:84%
This cannot be hoaxed, because
this chip is actually embedded

00:07:32.850 --> 00:07:37.650 align:middle line:84%
in the strata, and the strata
was made 225 to 250 million

00:07:37.650 --> 00:07:38.670 align:middle line:90%
years ago.

00:07:38.670 --> 00:07:40.290 align:middle line:90%
How does this happen?

00:07:40.290 --> 00:07:41.964 align:middle line:84%
What is it telling
us about our past?

00:07:41.964 --> 00:07:43.380 align:middle line:84%
This is one of the
great mysteries

00:07:43.380 --> 00:07:45.780 align:middle line:84%
that researchers are
struggling with right now.

00:07:45.780 --> 00:07:47.670 align:middle line:90%
But it goes even further.

00:07:47.670 --> 00:07:50.040 align:middle line:84%
I live in northern
New Mexico, and it

00:07:50.040 --> 00:07:54.510 align:middle line:84%
was in New Mexico in 1987 that
a researcher found what you're

00:07:54.510 --> 00:07:56.520 align:middle line:84%
seeing on the screen
right now, and it

00:07:56.520 --> 00:07:57.870 align:middle line:90%
is just what it looks like it.

00:07:57.870 --> 00:08:00.210 align:middle line:90%
Is a human footprint.

00:08:00.210 --> 00:08:03.090 align:middle line:84%
And it's not just a piece
of a human footprint.

00:08:03.090 --> 00:08:07.290 align:middle line:84%
This is a fully formed, very
well developed human footprint.

00:08:07.290 --> 00:08:12.750 align:middle line:84%
The problem is this footprint
is in Permian strata, a time

00:08:12.750 --> 00:08:18.390 align:middle line:84%
from the Permian period, that's
about 290 million years before

00:08:18.390 --> 00:08:19.530 align:middle line:90%
present.

00:08:19.530 --> 00:08:21.630 align:middle line:84%
Again, just for
reference, humans first

00:08:21.630 --> 00:08:24.870 align:middle line:90%
appeared only 200,000 years ago.

00:08:24.870 --> 00:08:29.310 align:middle line:84%
So what is a fully formed
human footprint doing in strata

00:08:29.310 --> 00:08:33.750 align:middle line:90%
that's 290 million years old?

00:08:33.750 --> 00:08:37.679 align:middle line:84%
In the Ordovician period,
a group of scientists

00:08:37.679 --> 00:08:39.950 align:middle line:84%
discovered what you're
seeing right now,

00:08:39.950 --> 00:08:41.799 align:middle line:84%
and it is just
what it looks like.

00:08:41.799 --> 00:08:46.494 align:middle line:84%
This is an iron hammer
on a wooden shaft that

00:08:46.494 --> 00:08:48.810 align:middle line:90%
was found in a town in Texas.

00:08:48.810 --> 00:08:50.160 align:middle line:90%
It's called London, Texas.

00:08:50.160 --> 00:08:53.540 align:middle line:90%
It was found in 1934.

00:08:53.540 --> 00:08:55.310 align:middle line:90%
And this cannot be hoaxed.

00:08:55.310 --> 00:08:58.430 align:middle line:84%
The shaft is actually
embedded into the strata.

00:08:58.430 --> 00:09:00.680 align:middle line:84%
And the wood in the
shaft has been there

00:09:00.680 --> 00:09:04.640 align:middle line:84%
so long it's actually
becoming carbonized into coal.

00:09:04.640 --> 00:09:08.270 align:middle line:84%
So the shaft of this hammer
is turning into coal.

00:09:08.270 --> 00:09:13.710 align:middle line:84%
How did this hammer get into
400-million-year-old strata?

00:09:13.710 --> 00:09:15.152 align:middle line:90%
But it doesn't stop there.

00:09:15.152 --> 00:09:16.610 align:middle line:84%
And I wanted to
share this with you

00:09:16.610 --> 00:09:18.693 align:middle line:84%
before we bring this all
together and then take it

00:09:18.693 --> 00:09:19.880 align:middle line:90%
to the next step.

00:09:19.880 --> 00:09:22.350 align:middle line:84%
In South Africa, one of
the great mysteries--

00:09:22.350 --> 00:09:27.050 align:middle line:84%
it was found years ago--
was an entire field

00:09:27.050 --> 00:09:30.980 align:middle line:84%
of spheres that are
made of a metal that

00:09:30.980 --> 00:09:34.340 align:middle line:84%
is not native to our
planet as we know it today.

00:09:34.340 --> 00:09:37.260 align:middle line:84%
It's been combined, an
alloy, in a way that

00:09:37.260 --> 00:09:39.410 align:middle line:90%
does not happen naturally.

00:09:39.410 --> 00:09:42.380 align:middle line:84%
But the thing is, the
spheres are all machined.

00:09:42.380 --> 00:09:45.780 align:middle line:84%
That they have machined
grooves around them.

00:09:45.780 --> 00:09:47.099 align:middle line:90%
Some of them are very large.

00:09:47.099 --> 00:09:48.140 align:middle line:90%
They're feet in diameter.

00:09:48.140 --> 00:09:50.180 align:middle line:84%
Some of them are only a
few centimeters or inches

00:09:50.180 --> 00:09:50.980 align:middle line:90%
in diameter.

00:09:50.980 --> 00:09:52.970 align:middle line:84%
You're seeing some on
the screen right now.

00:09:52.970 --> 00:09:54.600 align:middle line:90%
But here's the thing.

00:09:54.600 --> 00:09:57.800 align:middle line:84%
These mysterious
spheres in South Africa

00:09:57.800 --> 00:10:02.930 align:middle line:84%
are now being dated-- look
at this-- 570 million years

00:10:02.930 --> 00:10:05.060 align:middle line:90%
before present.

00:10:05.060 --> 00:10:07.640 align:middle line:84%
Now, I just want to
give you some context.

00:10:07.640 --> 00:10:12.260 align:middle line:84%
What you're seeing is
a geologic map of time.

00:10:12.260 --> 00:10:14.120 align:middle line:84%
You're seeing the most
recent at the top,

00:10:14.120 --> 00:10:16.730 align:middle line:84%
and the oldest strata,
again, is at the bottom.

00:10:16.730 --> 00:10:18.440 align:middle line:84%
And we've talked
about the Permian,

00:10:18.440 --> 00:10:21.110 align:middle line:84%
the Ordovician periods,
the Pleistocene period

00:10:21.110 --> 00:10:22.700 align:middle line:90%
near the top.

00:10:22.700 --> 00:10:26.240 align:middle line:84%
These spheres are
coming from a time

00:10:26.240 --> 00:10:32.030 align:middle line:84%
at the bottom of the geologic
time table before life began.

00:10:32.030 --> 00:10:33.860 align:middle line:84%
At this time, if
there was life, it

00:10:33.860 --> 00:10:36.380 align:middle line:84%
was only primitive, single
cell, maybe amoebas,

00:10:36.380 --> 00:10:37.940 align:middle line:90%
very primitive biological life.

00:10:37.940 --> 00:10:41.240 align:middle line:90%
It's called Pre-Cambrian period.

00:10:41.240 --> 00:10:42.680 align:middle line:90%
So this is the mystery.

00:10:42.680 --> 00:10:47.630 align:middle line:84%
What are these technologically
advanced, machined spheres

00:10:47.630 --> 00:10:50.450 align:middle line:84%
doing in South Africa at a
time when, not only are there

00:10:50.450 --> 00:10:53.930 align:middle line:84%
no humans, but the most
advanced forms of life

00:10:53.930 --> 00:10:57.110 align:middle line:84%
known at that time
were single cells?

00:10:57.110 --> 00:11:00.230 align:middle line:84%
Now you're getting a sense of
what Out Of Place Artifacts

00:11:00.230 --> 00:11:01.760 align:middle line:90%
are all about.

00:11:01.760 --> 00:11:05.530 align:middle line:84%
There are so many Out Of Place
Artifacts that scientists

00:11:05.530 --> 00:11:08.210 align:middle line:84%
now, again, put them into a
separate pile, and they said,

00:11:08.210 --> 00:11:10.485 align:middle line:84%
you know, these don't fit
the traditional story.

00:11:10.485 --> 00:11:12.860 align:middle line:84%
We're going to have to come
back and look at these later.

00:11:12.860 --> 00:11:14.720 align:middle line:90%
Well, later is now.

00:11:14.720 --> 00:11:17.060 align:middle line:84%
Because there are
so many anomalies,

00:11:17.060 --> 00:11:20.090 align:middle line:84%
they're saying there
must be another story,

00:11:20.090 --> 00:11:22.760 align:middle line:84%
or at the very least, the
story that we've embraced

00:11:22.760 --> 00:11:23.984 align:middle line:90%
is incomplete.

00:11:23.984 --> 00:11:25.400 align:middle line:84%
Let me be really
clear about this.

00:11:25.400 --> 00:11:26.483 align:middle line:90%
I'm not saying it's wrong.

00:11:26.483 --> 00:11:29.210 align:middle line:84%
I'm saying there's a good
chance that it's incomplete.

00:11:29.210 --> 00:11:32.990 align:middle line:84%
We have only gleaned a small
part of our true history.

00:11:32.990 --> 00:11:36.710 align:middle line:84%
So the question is, how far back
do these Out Of Place Artifacts

00:11:36.710 --> 00:11:37.850 align:middle line:90%
go?

00:11:37.850 --> 00:11:39.800 align:middle line:90%
Here's an even bigger question.

00:11:39.800 --> 00:11:42.450 align:middle line:84%
Are they confined
only to this planet?

00:11:42.450 --> 00:11:44.510 align:middle line:90%
Are they confined only to Earth?

00:11:44.510 --> 00:11:46.130 align:middle line:84%
Or is it possible
we can find Out

00:11:46.130 --> 00:11:50.870 align:middle line:84%
Of Place Artifacts in other
places, maybe like the moon?

00:11:50.870 --> 00:11:53.630 align:middle line:84%
Well, something very
interesting has happened.

00:11:53.630 --> 00:11:58.100 align:middle line:10%
In the year 2016, so
very, very recently,

00:11:58.100 --> 00:12:02.870 align:middle line:10%
NASA has just released
its entire archive

00:12:02.870 --> 00:12:07.880 align:middle line:10%
of lunar images, images
taken of the lunar surface,

00:12:07.880 --> 00:12:12.380 align:middle line:10%
from the Apollo missions,
all the way from 1961,

00:12:12.380 --> 00:12:15.260 align:middle line:10%
when they began, through 1972.

00:12:15.260 --> 00:12:19.490 align:middle line:84%
There are things on these
images that NASA cannot explain.

00:12:19.490 --> 00:12:22.680 align:middle line:84%
So they are called
anomalous images.

00:12:22.680 --> 00:12:25.910 align:middle line:84%
Some of them are so anomalous
that they have been pixelated

00:12:25.910 --> 00:12:27.890 align:middle line:84%
out so that we can't
really see what they are,

00:12:27.890 --> 00:12:30.200 align:middle line:90%
but we can still see the pixels.

00:12:30.200 --> 00:12:32.459 align:middle line:84%
So there's something
happening on the moon,

00:12:32.459 --> 00:12:34.250 align:middle line:84%
and I want you to see
some of these images,

00:12:34.250 --> 00:12:37.070 align:middle line:90%
just a couple of them.

00:12:37.070 --> 00:12:41.280 align:middle line:84%
I was an amateur archeologist
when I was in college.

00:12:41.280 --> 00:12:44.060 align:middle line:84%
And one of the things,
the very first things,

00:12:44.060 --> 00:12:46.820 align:middle line:84%
that I learned as an
archeologist is this.

00:12:46.820 --> 00:12:52.190 align:middle line:84%
When we see 90-degree angles
on an archeological site,

00:12:52.190 --> 00:12:54.980 align:middle line:84%
that tells us that it is, in
fact, an archeological site,

00:12:54.980 --> 00:12:58.190 align:middle line:84%
that it is not a
natural formation.

00:12:58.190 --> 00:13:01.580 align:middle line:84%
Nature does not erode with
wind in 90-degree angles,

00:13:01.580 --> 00:13:06.410 align:middle line:84%
or nature does not erode
through a stream or a river

00:13:06.410 --> 00:13:07.520 align:middle line:90%
in 90-degree angles.

00:13:07.520 --> 00:13:08.900 align:middle line:84%
So when you see
a 90-degree angle

00:13:08.900 --> 00:13:11.550 align:middle line:84%
like you're seeing on
your screen right now,

00:13:11.550 --> 00:13:14.800 align:middle line:84%
this is an excavated
archeological site

00:13:14.800 --> 00:13:16.970 align:middle line:84%
that we're seeing
in aerial view.

00:13:16.970 --> 00:13:19.370 align:middle line:84%
And it's very clear to see--
the red lines are showing us

00:13:19.370 --> 00:13:21.700 align:middle line:90%
where that 90-degree angle is.

00:13:21.700 --> 00:13:23.330 align:middle line:84%
The next damage
that you're seeing,

00:13:23.330 --> 00:13:24.980 align:middle line:84%
this is from the
surface of the moon.

00:13:24.980 --> 00:13:28.250 align:middle line:84%
And this is among the
images that NASA released.

00:13:28.250 --> 00:13:31.460 align:middle line:84%
You're seeing on the
lower right-hand portion

00:13:31.460 --> 00:13:34.672 align:middle line:84%
of the screen, you can see
what looks like a little cube.

00:13:34.672 --> 00:13:36.380 align:middle line:84%
And then in the upper
right-hand portion,

00:13:36.380 --> 00:13:39.860 align:middle line:84%
you're seeing what definitely
is an enlargement of that cube.

00:13:39.860 --> 00:13:42.500 align:middle line:84%
Those are definitely
90-degree angles.

00:13:42.500 --> 00:13:45.320 align:middle line:84%
They are definitely
made intentionally.

00:13:45.320 --> 00:13:47.720 align:middle line:84%
They are not the
result of erosion.

00:13:47.720 --> 00:13:50.390 align:middle line:84%
The question is, what are
they doing on the moon?

00:13:50.390 --> 00:13:53.720 align:middle line:84%
We have been led to believe
that the moon is a sterile

00:13:53.720 --> 00:13:56.270 align:middle line:84%
surface, that there is no
life existing on the moon,

00:13:56.270 --> 00:13:58.190 align:middle line:90%
nor has there ever been.

00:13:58.190 --> 00:13:59.960 align:middle line:84%
So when we begin to
see things like this--

00:13:59.960 --> 00:14:03.680 align:middle line:84%
and again, these images are
from 1961 through 1972--

00:14:03.680 --> 00:14:05.060 align:middle line:90%
what do they mean?

00:14:05.060 --> 00:14:07.370 align:middle line:84%
Well, if it was only
one image, you'd say,

00:14:07.370 --> 00:14:09.330 align:middle line:84%
maybe it's just
a trick of light,

00:14:09.330 --> 00:14:11.300 align:middle line:90%
a trick of light and shadow.

00:14:11.300 --> 00:14:13.310 align:middle line:90%
But it's not just one image.

00:14:13.310 --> 00:14:15.110 align:middle line:84%
I want you to see some
of the other images

00:14:15.110 --> 00:14:17.000 align:middle line:90%
that NASA is releasing.

00:14:17.000 --> 00:14:19.550 align:middle line:84%
The Clementine
mission to the moon

00:14:19.550 --> 00:14:23.030 align:middle line:84%
came later, after
the Apollo missions.

00:14:23.030 --> 00:14:25.350 align:middle line:84%
So Clementine was
a separate mission

00:14:25.350 --> 00:14:26.750 align:middle line:84%
that went back to
the moon, maybe

00:14:26.750 --> 00:14:29.240 align:middle line:84%
to look a little closer
at some of the anomalies

00:14:29.240 --> 00:14:30.710 align:middle line:90%
that Apollo was seeing.

00:14:30.710 --> 00:14:33.890 align:middle line:84%
It's the Clementine images
that we're finding pixilated,

00:14:33.890 --> 00:14:36.329 align:middle line:84%
although they are
released to the public.

00:14:36.329 --> 00:14:37.370 align:middle line:90%
So you're seeing one now.

00:14:37.370 --> 00:14:39.530 align:middle line:84%
There's obviously
something here in the image

00:14:39.530 --> 00:14:42.770 align:middle line:84%
that you're seeing that
for whatever reason,

00:14:42.770 --> 00:14:44.964 align:middle line:90%
we're not being allowed to see.

00:14:44.964 --> 00:14:46.880 align:middle line:84%
What could that be on
the surface of the moon?

00:14:46.880 --> 00:14:49.730 align:middle line:84%
What is the Out Of Place
Artifact that we're not seeing?

00:14:49.730 --> 00:14:53.990 align:middle line:84%
Here's another one that looks
more like some kind of a tower,

00:14:53.990 --> 00:14:56.700 align:middle line:84%
perhaps, of some kind
or an obelisk that's

00:14:56.700 --> 00:14:58.310 align:middle line:90%
been pixeled out.

00:14:58.310 --> 00:15:00.860 align:middle line:84%
These are from the
Clementine mission.

00:15:00.860 --> 00:15:06.374 align:middle line:84%
Now, when people see things
like this on the moon,

00:15:06.374 --> 00:15:07.790 align:middle line:84%
the first thing
that comes to mind

00:15:07.790 --> 00:15:13.050 align:middle line:84%
is aliens, ETs, UFOs,
things like that.

00:15:13.050 --> 00:15:16.130 align:middle line:84%
And I fully believe,
I'm certain,

00:15:16.130 --> 00:15:18.290 align:middle line:84%
that we are not alone
in this universe.

00:15:18.290 --> 00:15:20.570 align:middle line:84%
It would make no
sense for us to be.

00:15:20.570 --> 00:15:24.080 align:middle line:84%
That there's an overwhelming
body of evidence suggesting now

00:15:24.080 --> 00:15:27.500 align:middle line:84%
that other life forms have been
with us for a very long time,

00:15:27.500 --> 00:15:29.780 align:middle line:84%
both in our world
and in other worlds.

00:15:29.780 --> 00:15:31.710 align:middle line:10%
The astronauts have
talked about this, those

00:15:31.710 --> 00:15:33.992 align:middle line:10%
that have been interviewed.

00:15:33.992 --> 00:15:36.200 align:middle line:84%
But I'm going to give you
just a little bit different

00:15:36.200 --> 00:15:37.760 align:middle line:90%
perspective.

00:15:37.760 --> 00:15:40.160 align:middle line:90%
This is the year 2016.

00:15:40.160 --> 00:15:42.770 align:middle line:84%
We are living a
time of extremes.

00:15:42.770 --> 00:15:45.470 align:middle line:84%
We are living a time when
the cycles of conflict

00:15:45.470 --> 00:15:47.702 align:middle line:84%
are ramping up
through the year 2020.

00:15:47.702 --> 00:15:49.160 align:middle line:84%
You don't need me
to tell you that.

00:15:49.160 --> 00:15:54.740 align:middle line:84%
You can feel the tension in
the world, the push toward war.

00:15:54.740 --> 00:15:56.720 align:middle line:84%
Doesn't mean that
war needs to happen,

00:15:56.720 --> 00:15:58.795 align:middle line:84%
but there are multiple
places and hotspots where

00:15:58.795 --> 00:16:00.170 align:middle line:84%
you can see right
now it wouldn't

00:16:00.170 --> 00:16:02.420 align:middle line:90%
take much to create that.

00:16:02.420 --> 00:16:06.370 align:middle line:84%
OK, at the same time,
something else is happening.

00:16:06.370 --> 00:16:10.720 align:middle line:84%
During the Cold War years,
there were only two nations

00:16:10.720 --> 00:16:12.520 align:middle line:84%
that had the money
and the technology

00:16:12.520 --> 00:16:16.420 align:middle line:84%
to go to the moon, the
former USSR, former Soviet

00:16:16.420 --> 00:16:19.052 align:middle line:84%
Union, and the former
United States of America.

00:16:19.052 --> 00:16:21.010 align:middle line:84%
And I have to say that
because both nations are

00:16:21.010 --> 00:16:24.010 align:middle line:84%
so broke right now that
we're not going back

00:16:24.010 --> 00:16:27.460 align:middle line:84%
to the moon, at least in the
way that we have in the past.

00:16:27.460 --> 00:16:30.940 align:middle line:84%
But there are other nations
that are going to the moon.

00:16:30.940 --> 00:16:36.280 align:middle line:84%
During the Cold War, even
though the former Soviet Union

00:16:36.280 --> 00:16:37.870 align:middle line:84%
and former United
States of America

00:16:37.870 --> 00:16:40.660 align:middle line:84%
were at war on one level,
it was a very civilized war

00:16:40.660 --> 00:16:42.370 align:middle line:84%
in some respects,
because there were

00:16:42.370 --> 00:16:45.130 align:middle line:84%
agreements among
scientists on other levels.

00:16:45.130 --> 00:16:48.040 align:middle line:84%
One of those agreements
was that things

00:16:48.040 --> 00:16:50.950 align:middle line:84%
that were found on the
moon, for whatever reason,

00:16:50.950 --> 00:16:54.880 align:middle line:84%
were not publicly
shared among the people

00:16:54.880 --> 00:16:56.475 align:middle line:90%
of the Earth at the time.

00:16:56.475 --> 00:16:58.850 align:middle line:84%
And I'm not going to say it's
right, wrong, good, or bad.

00:16:58.850 --> 00:17:00.940 align:middle line:84%
There were research
programs that

00:17:00.940 --> 00:17:03.010 align:middle line:84%
said that certain
kinds of information

00:17:03.010 --> 00:17:05.560 align:middle line:84%
could disrupt the
fabric of society

00:17:05.560 --> 00:17:07.387 align:middle line:90%
and overturn religious beliefs.

00:17:07.387 --> 00:17:08.720 align:middle line:90%
And again, it was another world.

00:17:08.720 --> 00:17:10.891 align:middle line:90%
This was the '60s and the '70s.

00:17:10.891 --> 00:17:12.849 align:middle line:84%
But the point is those
agreements were honored,

00:17:12.849 --> 00:17:14.807 align:middle line:84%
and I think that's one
of the reasons we're not

00:17:14.807 --> 00:17:17.079 align:middle line:90%
seeing some of these images.

00:17:17.079 --> 00:17:21.670 align:middle line:84%
The nations that are now
on their way to the moon,

00:17:21.670 --> 00:17:24.579 align:middle line:84%
the nations that have the
money and the technology

00:17:24.579 --> 00:17:27.550 align:middle line:84%
and the will to return, were
not part of those agreements.

00:17:27.550 --> 00:17:32.020 align:middle line:84%
China, for example, India are
both on their way to the moon.

00:17:32.020 --> 00:17:35.710 align:middle line:84%
And both nations have said that
when they land on the moon,

00:17:35.710 --> 00:17:38.200 align:middle line:84%
they will televise to the
people of the Earth whatever

00:17:38.200 --> 00:17:41.000 align:middle line:84%
it is that they find
live as they find it.

00:17:41.000 --> 00:17:43.151 align:middle line:84%
Here's why I believe
this is important.

00:17:43.151 --> 00:17:44.650 align:middle line:84%
And this is a place
where I'm moving

00:17:44.650 --> 00:17:46.120 align:middle line:90%
beyond peer-reviewed science.

00:17:46.120 --> 00:17:47.650 align:middle line:84%
I'm sharing with
you my perspective,

00:17:47.650 --> 00:17:50.620 align:middle line:90%
my sense, my belief.

00:17:50.620 --> 00:17:53.890 align:middle line:84%
When we find those Out Of
Place Artifacts on the moon,

00:17:53.890 --> 00:17:57.190 align:middle line:84%
when we find
archeological remnants

00:17:57.190 --> 00:18:00.270 align:middle line:84%
of intentional civilization
in a place where

00:18:00.270 --> 00:18:03.850 align:middle line:84%
we used to be hoping to find
microbes-- we were looking

00:18:03.850 --> 00:18:05.950 align:middle line:84%
for life, hoping to
find microscopic life,

00:18:05.950 --> 00:18:09.080 align:middle line:84%
and now we're finding
entire temple complexes,

00:18:09.080 --> 00:18:11.530 align:middle line:84%
is what appears to
be on those images.

00:18:11.530 --> 00:18:15.730 align:middle line:84%
When we find those,
my sense is that we're

00:18:15.730 --> 00:18:20.540 align:middle line:84%
going to discover something
that could be the most powerful,

00:18:20.540 --> 00:18:22.690 align:middle line:84%
the most unifying
experienced the people

00:18:22.690 --> 00:18:25.930 align:middle line:84%
in our global family, the people
of Earth, could ever have.

00:18:25.930 --> 00:18:29.710 align:middle line:84%
Because my sense is that when
we go into those ancient sites,

00:18:29.710 --> 00:18:32.740 align:middle line:84%
we're going to find the
hieroglyphs on the walls.

00:18:32.740 --> 00:18:34.870 align:middle line:84%
We're going to find
writing in languages

00:18:34.870 --> 00:18:38.530 align:middle line:84%
that we already know in the
original languages called

00:18:38.530 --> 00:18:43.390 align:middle line:84%
root languages of the Earth--
Hebrew, Sanskrit, Cuneiform,

00:18:43.390 --> 00:18:44.625 align:middle line:90%
Arabic.

00:18:44.625 --> 00:18:46.000 align:middle line:84%
And the reason
we're finding them

00:18:46.000 --> 00:18:50.110 align:middle line:84%
there is because those
sites are not necessarily

00:18:50.110 --> 00:18:52.600 align:middle line:90%
alien ET UFO sites.

00:18:52.600 --> 00:18:54.820 align:middle line:84%
I believe there are
sites that were developed

00:18:54.820 --> 00:19:00.820 align:middle line:84%
by us from another cycle of
another civilization, when

00:19:00.820 --> 00:19:04.450 align:middle line:84%
we worked together as a
family on this planet,

00:19:04.450 --> 00:19:09.430 align:middle line:84%
when we cooperated and achieved
great and beautiful things.

00:19:09.430 --> 00:19:12.670 align:middle line:84%
And my question is, if
we were able to do things

00:19:12.670 --> 00:19:14.830 align:middle line:84%
like that in the
past, how much further

00:19:14.830 --> 00:19:18.160 align:middle line:84%
could we go if we did
the same thing right now

00:19:18.160 --> 00:19:19.910 align:middle line:90%
with what we know today?

00:19:19.910 --> 00:19:21.400 align:middle line:90%
Here's the beauty.

00:19:21.400 --> 00:19:25.570 align:middle line:84%
Here we are on the verge of war
at a time when the cycles are

00:19:25.570 --> 00:19:29.200 align:middle line:84%
converging, creating the
tension in a time of extremes,

00:19:29.200 --> 00:19:34.420 align:middle line:84%
and at exactly that time, we
may find the evidence of us

00:19:34.420 --> 00:19:37.930 align:middle line:84%
from another time that
has the power to unify us

00:19:37.930 --> 00:19:39.700 align:middle line:90%
rather than divide us.

00:19:39.700 --> 00:19:41.170 align:middle line:84%
And I think we're
going to see that

00:19:41.170 --> 00:19:43.680 align:middle line:90%
very soon in our lifetimes.

00:19:43.680 --> 00:19:45.074 align:middle line:90%
So what would that mean?

00:19:45.074 --> 00:19:46.990 align:middle line:84%
Would it mean if we found
something like that?

00:19:46.990 --> 00:19:50.400 align:middle line:84%
And when we look at the
advanced civilizations on Earth,

00:19:50.400 --> 00:19:52.480 align:middle line:84%
why did those
civilizations collapse?

00:19:52.480 --> 00:19:55.210 align:middle line:90%
What happened in the past?

00:19:55.210 --> 00:19:58.510 align:middle line:84%
Is there something that
could have happened then

00:19:58.510 --> 00:20:00.150 align:middle line:90%
that we've forgotten?

00:20:00.150 --> 00:20:03.370 align:middle line:84%
Or maybe we chose to
forget, because whatever

00:20:03.370 --> 00:20:07.090 align:middle line:84%
it was was so painful we
didn't want to carry it

00:20:07.090 --> 00:20:09.260 align:middle line:90%
into future civilizations.

00:20:09.260 --> 00:20:11.500 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to share
with you another

00:20:11.500 --> 00:20:14.850 align:middle line:84%
Out Of Place Artifact,
an ancient clue

00:20:14.850 --> 00:20:18.480 align:middle line:84%
that it is happening in
what is now Pakistan.

00:20:18.480 --> 00:20:22.240 align:middle line:84%
It is in an area that used to
be between India and Pakistan,

00:20:22.240 --> 00:20:26.710 align:middle line:84%
ancient, ancient sites,
archeological sites,

00:20:26.710 --> 00:20:29.335 align:middle line:84%
such as Mohenjo
Daro and Harappa.

00:20:29.335 --> 00:20:31.360 align:middle line:84%
And we've known about
these sites for a while.

00:20:31.360 --> 00:20:35.050 align:middle line:84%
They're about 5,000
years before present,

00:20:35.050 --> 00:20:36.850 align:middle line:90%
is when we say they originated.

00:20:36.850 --> 00:20:39.386 align:middle line:84%
Interestingly, it's the
beginning of the last cycle,

00:20:39.386 --> 00:20:42.010 align:middle line:84%
and it also happens to be at the
time of the last great climate

00:20:42.010 --> 00:20:43.390 align:middle line:90%
change.

00:20:43.390 --> 00:20:46.840 align:middle line:84%
What we're finding is evidence
of an advanced society,

00:20:46.840 --> 00:20:49.240 align:middle line:84%
an advanced society that
had things in their time

00:20:49.240 --> 00:20:50.400 align:middle line:90%
that we have in ours today.

00:20:50.400 --> 00:20:51.775 align:middle line:84%
They had knowledge
of mathematics

00:20:51.775 --> 00:20:55.350 align:middle line:84%
and chemistry, architecture,
advanced architecture,

00:20:55.350 --> 00:20:57.040 align:middle line:90%
multi-story buildings.

00:20:57.040 --> 00:20:59.050 align:middle line:84%
They had closed,
indoor plumbing,

00:20:59.050 --> 00:21:01.600 align:middle line:84%
hot and cold running
water, flush toilets,

00:21:01.600 --> 00:21:03.260 align:middle line:90%
stained glass in their windows.

00:21:03.260 --> 00:21:05.260 align:middle line:84%
They even had buried
pipelines, where

00:21:05.260 --> 00:21:08.470 align:middle line:84%
there have been wires
and remnants of cables

00:21:08.470 --> 00:21:11.740 align:middle line:84%
and what are believed to
be ancient batteries found

00:21:11.740 --> 00:21:13.030 align:middle line:90%
in these sites.

00:21:13.030 --> 00:21:16.900 align:middle line:84%
So clearly, these were
not primitive grass huts.

00:21:16.900 --> 00:21:19.930 align:middle line:84%
These were advanced
technological civilizations,

00:21:19.930 --> 00:21:21.400 align:middle line:90%
and they had more.

00:21:21.400 --> 00:21:24.340 align:middle line:84%
They had amazing
art, beautiful art,

00:21:24.340 --> 00:21:28.040 align:middle line:84%
using techniques of sculpture
that we're only beginning

00:21:28.040 --> 00:21:30.710 align:middle line:90%
to use now in the 20th century.

00:21:30.710 --> 00:21:33.070 align:middle line:84%
But there are a lot of
mysteries in these sites.

00:21:33.070 --> 00:21:35.080 align:middle line:90%
One of the mysteries is this.

00:21:35.080 --> 00:21:38.500 align:middle line:84%
When the archeologists
began to uncover the sites,

00:21:38.500 --> 00:21:40.680 align:middle line:90%
they found human skeletons.

00:21:40.680 --> 00:21:43.690 align:middle line:84%
The skeletons were
not arranged randomly.

00:21:43.690 --> 00:21:46.450 align:middle line:84%
They were toward
one end of the city

00:21:46.450 --> 00:21:49.090 align:middle line:84%
and, to quote the words of
one of the archeologists,

00:21:49.090 --> 00:21:51.960 align:middle line:84%
they were in
"postures of flight."

00:21:51.960 --> 00:21:53.890 align:middle line:84%
That means they were
running from something.

00:21:53.890 --> 00:21:55.930 align:middle line:84%
They were moving
in one direction.

00:21:55.930 --> 00:21:57.430 align:middle line:84%
Some of the
skeletons, the bodies

00:21:57.430 --> 00:21:59.876 align:middle line:84%
were holding one
another for comfort.

00:21:59.876 --> 00:22:01.000 align:middle line:90%
Some of them were families.

00:22:01.000 --> 00:22:02.620 align:middle line:90%
Some of them were individuals.

00:22:02.620 --> 00:22:04.453 align:middle line:84%
There were animals that
were some with them.

00:22:04.453 --> 00:22:05.290 align:middle line:90%
They had their pets.

00:22:05.290 --> 00:22:07.190 align:middle line:90%
But here's the thing.

00:22:07.190 --> 00:22:11.710 align:middle line:84%
Some of those skeletons have a
higher degree of radioactivity

00:22:11.710 --> 00:22:14.540 align:middle line:84%
than they should have just
from being in the ground

00:22:14.540 --> 00:22:16.090 align:middle line:90%
from background radiation.

00:22:16.090 --> 00:22:18.500 align:middle line:84%
And this has been a big
mystery to the scientists

00:22:18.500 --> 00:22:19.300 align:middle line:90%
for a long time.

00:22:19.300 --> 00:22:22.350 align:middle line:84%
You're seeing an
image on your screen,

00:22:22.350 --> 00:22:24.870 align:middle line:84%
an actual photograph
of some of the bodies

00:22:24.870 --> 00:22:28.580 align:middle line:84%
and the way they're
arranged right now.

00:22:28.580 --> 00:22:30.650 align:middle line:84%
The scientists,
archeologists also

00:22:30.650 --> 00:22:34.880 align:middle line:84%
began to find evidence of what
is called vitrified stone.

00:22:34.880 --> 00:22:39.840 align:middle line:84%
What that means is that
in the walls of the homes,

00:22:39.840 --> 00:22:45.320 align:middle line:84%
for example, or in the floors
made of quartz or granite that

00:22:45.320 --> 00:22:49.719 align:middle line:84%
is made of quartz and feldspar
and mica, some of the minerals,

00:22:49.719 --> 00:22:51.260 align:middle line:84%
while they're still
in place, they've

00:22:51.260 --> 00:22:54.770 align:middle line:84%
been exposed to a heat that
was so intense it melted

00:22:54.770 --> 00:23:00.350 align:middle line:84%
the minerals in place-- a
high, intense, rapid heat that

00:23:00.350 --> 00:23:01.667 align:middle line:90%
melted these minerals in place.

00:23:01.667 --> 00:23:03.500 align:middle line:84%
And one of the mysteries--
the archeologists

00:23:03.500 --> 00:23:07.910 align:middle line:84%
began to find these
mysterious lumps of something.

00:23:07.910 --> 00:23:10.320 align:middle line:84%
And it took them a
while to understand

00:23:10.320 --> 00:23:13.070 align:middle line:84%
that what they were looking
at were lumps of clay that

00:23:13.070 --> 00:23:18.800 align:middle line:84%
used to be clay vases and
clay dolls for children

00:23:18.800 --> 00:23:20.360 align:middle line:90%
that had also been vitrified.

00:23:20.360 --> 00:23:23.240 align:middle line:84%
They were exposed to
a rapid, intense heat.

00:23:23.240 --> 00:23:26.540 align:middle line:84%
They were melted so
quickly all that's left now

00:23:26.540 --> 00:23:28.550 align:middle line:90%
is a stone ball.

00:23:28.550 --> 00:23:31.340 align:middle line:84%
So these kinds of things
are the mysteries.

00:23:31.340 --> 00:23:33.710 align:middle line:84%
The scientists are
saying, what happened?

00:23:33.710 --> 00:23:36.312 align:middle line:84%
What could have happened
in this part of the world?

00:23:36.312 --> 00:23:38.270 align:middle line:84%
Well, this is one of
those places where we have

00:23:38.270 --> 00:23:39.510 align:middle line:90%
to look beyond the evidence.

00:23:39.510 --> 00:23:40.889 align:middle line:84%
If you look only
at the evidence,

00:23:40.889 --> 00:23:42.930 align:middle line:84%
you'll never understand
what it is that happened.

00:23:42.930 --> 00:23:44.360 align:middle line:90%
We need context.

00:23:44.360 --> 00:23:48.920 align:middle line:84%
And some of that context is
coming from the oral traditions

00:23:48.920 --> 00:23:52.310 align:middle line:84%
of this part of the world
from the Hindu traditions

00:23:52.310 --> 00:23:55.010 align:middle line:84%
of the Mahabharata,
and specifically

00:23:55.010 --> 00:23:57.860 align:middle line:84%
in the Bhagavad Gita,
which is a small portion

00:23:57.860 --> 00:24:00.200 align:middle line:90%
of the Mahabharata.

00:24:00.200 --> 00:24:03.650 align:middle line:84%
This portion of the
Mahabharata tells a story

00:24:03.650 --> 00:24:05.870 align:middle line:84%
of an ancient
battle that happened

00:24:05.870 --> 00:24:09.480 align:middle line:84%
between two advanced
civilizations a long time ago.

00:24:09.480 --> 00:24:11.840 align:middle line:90%
It doesn't give the exact dates.

00:24:11.840 --> 00:24:15.740 align:middle line:84%
And as these two civilizations
clashed, one of them

00:24:15.740 --> 00:24:18.140 align:middle line:84%
began to lose the
battle, and they

00:24:18.140 --> 00:24:21.050 align:middle line:84%
resorted to using a
weapon that had never

00:24:21.050 --> 00:24:23.380 align:middle line:84%
been used before--
a technology that

00:24:23.380 --> 00:24:25.160 align:middle line:90%
had never been used before.

00:24:25.160 --> 00:24:28.910 align:middle line:84%
And they wrote about what
the effects of this weapon

00:24:28.910 --> 00:24:33.440 align:middle line:84%
were in a way that made no
sense until the 20th century

00:24:33.440 --> 00:24:35.690 align:middle line:84%
because we had nothing
to compare it to.

00:24:35.690 --> 00:24:37.310 align:middle line:10%
I'd like to read
portions of this

00:24:37.310 --> 00:24:41.290 align:middle line:10%
to you for accuracy right now.

00:24:41.290 --> 00:24:44.780 align:middle line:10%
So the ancient Mahabharata
says specifically,

00:24:44.780 --> 00:24:46.730 align:middle line:10%
and I'm going to
read these texts.

00:24:46.730 --> 00:24:48.060 align:middle line:10%
This is a quote.

00:24:48.060 --> 00:24:51.830 align:middle line:10%
"A single projectile
charged with all the power

00:24:51.830 --> 00:24:56.570 align:middle line:10%
of the universe, an incandescent
column of smoke and flame

00:24:56.570 --> 00:25:01.220 align:middle line:10%
as bright as 1,000 suns,
rose in all its splendor,

00:25:01.220 --> 00:25:05.720 align:middle line:10%
a perpendicular explosion with
its billowing smoke clouds,

00:25:05.720 --> 00:25:10.250 align:middle line:10%
the cloud of smoke rising after
its first explosion formed

00:25:10.250 --> 00:25:14.060 align:middle line:10%
into expanding, round
circles, like the opening

00:25:14.060 --> 00:25:16.570 align:middle line:10%
of giant parasols."

00:25:16.570 --> 00:25:19.520 align:middle line:10%
It's this next piece that
I think is so telling.

00:25:19.520 --> 00:25:20.610 align:middle line:90%
This is a direct quote.

00:25:20.610 --> 00:25:26.270 align:middle line:10%
It says, "It was an unknown
weapon, an iron thunderbolt,

00:25:26.270 --> 00:25:28.730 align:middle line:10%
a gigantic messenger
of death, which

00:25:28.730 --> 00:25:33.230 align:middle line:10%
reduced to ashes the entire
race of the Vrishnis"

00:25:33.230 --> 00:25:36.900 align:middle line:10%
and the other people
who were there.

00:25:36.900 --> 00:25:40.020 align:middle line:10%
"The corpses were
so burned as to be

00:25:40.020 --> 00:25:44.160 align:middle line:10%
unrecognizable the hair and
the fingernails fell out.

00:25:44.160 --> 00:25:46.650 align:middle line:10%
Pottery broke without
apparent cause.

00:25:46.650 --> 00:25:50.340 align:middle line:10%
And the birds turned
white in the sky and fell.

00:25:50.340 --> 00:25:54.290 align:middle line:10%
After a few hours, all
foodstuffs were infected.

00:25:54.290 --> 00:25:56.370 align:middle line:10%
To escape from this
fire, the soldiers

00:25:56.370 --> 00:25:57.930 align:middle line:10%
threw themselves
into the streams

00:25:57.930 --> 00:26:00.930 align:middle line:10%
to wash themselves
and their equipment."

00:26:00.930 --> 00:26:04.400 align:middle line:84%
Where did that
description come from?

00:26:04.400 --> 00:26:08.310 align:middle line:84%
What could have been seen in
the eyes of the people living

00:26:08.310 --> 00:26:12.510 align:middle line:84%
in Mohenjo Daro 5,000
years ago to prompt them

00:26:12.510 --> 00:26:15.840 align:middle line:84%
to describe something
that made no sense

00:26:15.840 --> 00:26:17.920 align:middle line:90%
until the 20th century?

00:26:17.920 --> 00:26:22.220 align:middle line:84%
Does Mohenjo Daro offer
evidence of the unthinkable?

00:26:22.220 --> 00:26:24.510 align:middle line:84%
And this is a question
that scientists are

00:26:24.510 --> 00:26:27.880 align:middle line:90%
asking themselves right now.

00:26:27.880 --> 00:26:31.900 align:middle line:84%
The father of the nuclear
age, the atomic bomb, Robert

00:26:31.900 --> 00:26:35.620 align:middle line:84%
Oppenheimer, after
the detonation

00:26:35.620 --> 00:26:39.580 align:middle line:84%
of the first nuclear device,
he was being interviewed

00:26:39.580 --> 00:26:41.380 align:middle line:90%
at Rochester University.

00:26:41.380 --> 00:26:44.800 align:middle line:84%
And the interviewer asked
Robert Oppenheimer a question.

00:26:44.800 --> 00:26:46.960 align:middle line:84%
And it's such a
telling question.

00:26:46.960 --> 00:26:49.930 align:middle line:84%
The answer that he
gave was so unexpected.

00:26:49.930 --> 00:26:53.350 align:middle line:84%
Listen to the question,
and listen to the answer.

00:26:53.350 --> 00:26:55.000 align:middle line:84%
The student asked
Mr. Oppenheimer,

00:26:55.000 --> 00:26:58.540 align:middle line:84%
he said, how do you feel
after having exploded

00:26:58.540 --> 00:27:02.060 align:middle line:90%
the first atomic bomb on Earth?

00:27:02.060 --> 00:27:05.060 align:middle line:84%
Oppenheimer answered,
and he said, well,

00:27:05.060 --> 00:27:10.700 align:middle line:84%
not the first atomic bomb, he
said, but the first atomic bomb

00:27:10.700 --> 00:27:12.872 align:middle line:90%
in modern times.

00:27:12.872 --> 00:27:14.920 align:middle line:84%
>> We knew the world
would not be the same.

00:27:14.920 --> 00:27:18.080 align:middle line:90%


00:27:18.080 --> 00:27:22.080 align:middle line:10%
A few people laughed.

00:27:22.080 --> 00:27:24.580 align:middle line:10%
A few people cried.

00:27:24.580 --> 00:27:25.785 align:middle line:10%
Most people were silent.

00:27:25.785 --> 00:27:29.390 align:middle line:90%


00:27:29.390 --> 00:27:33.340 align:middle line:10%
I remembered the line
from the Hindu scripture,

00:27:33.340 --> 00:27:41.810 align:middle line:10%
the Bhagavad Gita,
Vishnu was trying

00:27:41.810 --> 00:27:46.140 align:middle line:10%
persuade the prince
that he should

00:27:46.140 --> 00:27:54.090 align:middle line:10%
do his duty and, to impress him,
takes on his multi-armed form

00:27:54.090 --> 00:27:58.270 align:middle line:10%
and says, "Now I
am become death,

00:27:58.270 --> 00:28:02.422 align:middle line:10%
the destroyer of worlds."

00:28:02.422 --> 00:28:06.160 align:middle line:84%
I suppose we all though
that one way or another.

00:28:06.160 --> 00:28:08.530 align:middle line:84%
>>GREGG: Interestingly,
Robert Oppenheimer

00:28:08.530 --> 00:28:10.720 align:middle line:84%
was a student of
the Mahabharata.

00:28:10.720 --> 00:28:14.320 align:middle line:84%
He was a student of
the Bhagavad Gita.

00:28:14.320 --> 00:28:18.790 align:middle line:84%
And he is famously quoted as
witnessing that first mushroom

00:28:18.790 --> 00:28:21.490 align:middle line:84%
cloud and saying
under his breath,

00:28:21.490 --> 00:28:25.210 align:middle line:84%
"I have become death,
the destroyer of worlds,"

00:28:25.210 --> 00:28:27.550 align:middle line:84%
which is a direct quote
from the Mahabharata.

00:28:27.550 --> 00:28:30.900 align:middle line:84%
So Robert Oppenheimer
firmly believed

00:28:30.900 --> 00:28:34.870 align:middle line:84%
that there had been nuclear
devices on this Earth

00:28:34.870 --> 00:28:38.690 align:middle line:84%
from advanced civilizations in
the past, and he's not alone.

00:28:38.690 --> 00:28:41.410 align:middle line:84%
Other scientists have
sensed the same thing,

00:28:41.410 --> 00:28:44.440 align:middle line:84%
because they see the
trajectory of civilization

00:28:44.440 --> 00:28:48.340 align:middle line:84%
and how the cycles ebb and flow
and where we are in the cycles

00:28:48.340 --> 00:28:49.690 align:middle line:90%
today.

00:28:49.690 --> 00:28:52.990 align:middle line:90%
Well, this is all conjecture.

00:28:52.990 --> 00:28:55.750 align:middle line:84%
But it wasn't until
Google Earth began

00:28:55.750 --> 00:28:59.410 align:middle line:84%
looking at this part of the
world from another perspective,

00:28:59.410 --> 00:29:02.080 align:middle line:84%
from satellites, that they
found what you're seeing

00:29:02.080 --> 00:29:03.320 align:middle line:90%
on your screen right now.

00:29:03.320 --> 00:29:05.020 align:middle line:90%
This is a Google Earth image.

00:29:05.020 --> 00:29:07.330 align:middle line:90%
It is obviously a crater.

00:29:07.330 --> 00:29:09.010 align:middle line:84%
The first thing
that scientists did

00:29:09.010 --> 00:29:10.900 align:middle line:84%
when they saw this
crater in the area

00:29:10.900 --> 00:29:13.330 align:middle line:84%
of these archeological
sites, they said,

00:29:13.330 --> 00:29:16.870 align:middle line:84%
well, maybe an asteroid hit
the earth a long time ago.

00:29:16.870 --> 00:29:20.890 align:middle line:84%
When they excavated through
the bottom of this crater,

00:29:20.890 --> 00:29:23.710 align:middle line:84%
they found no evidence
of any kind of impact

00:29:23.710 --> 00:29:25.480 align:middle line:90%
from an asteroid.

00:29:25.480 --> 00:29:27.280 align:middle line:84%
So the fact that
this crater exists,

00:29:27.280 --> 00:29:29.950 align:middle line:84%
the fact that we
have vitrified stone,

00:29:29.950 --> 00:29:34.750 align:middle line:84%
that we have vitrified clay
vases and toys from children,

00:29:34.750 --> 00:29:38.770 align:middle line:84%
that we have radioactive
skeletons in postures of flight

00:29:38.770 --> 00:29:42.280 align:middle line:84%
in an ancient city that
is described in the text

00:29:42.280 --> 00:29:46.060 align:middle line:84%
as being the victim of an
ancient war using a weapon that

00:29:46.060 --> 00:29:50.710 align:middle line:84%
never been used before, it
brings all of this to a focus

00:29:50.710 --> 00:29:53.260 align:middle line:84%
and says, have we
been here before?

00:29:53.260 --> 00:29:55.840 align:middle line:90%
Have we done this in the past?

00:29:55.840 --> 00:30:00.490 align:middle line:84%
Are we unconsciously
living a cycle,

00:30:00.490 --> 00:30:03.880 align:middle line:84%
where technology advances
in one particular way at one

00:30:03.880 --> 00:30:07.720 align:middle line:84%
particular time to the point
where we are given the ability

00:30:07.720 --> 00:30:11.470 align:middle line:84%
to preserve or destroy all that
we love, all that we cherish,

00:30:11.470 --> 00:30:15.940 align:middle line:84%
all that we hold dear, and are
we at that point right now?

00:30:15.940 --> 00:30:18.760 align:middle line:84%
That's the question
that we need to ask.

00:30:18.760 --> 00:30:23.200 align:middle line:84%
So we owe it to ourselves
to answer this question.

00:30:23.200 --> 00:30:24.850 align:middle line:90%
What happened?

00:30:24.850 --> 00:30:27.850 align:middle line:84%
What happened to Mohenjo
Daro so long ago?

00:30:27.850 --> 00:30:31.310 align:middle line:84%
What can we learn from
what they left behind?

00:30:31.310 --> 00:30:33.970 align:middle line:84%
Well, in our next
episode, we're going

00:30:33.970 --> 00:30:37.210 align:middle line:84%
to take this exploration
beyond the temples

00:30:37.210 --> 00:30:40.840 align:middle line:84%
and the walls of advanced
civilizations from the past.

00:30:40.840 --> 00:30:43.810 align:middle line:84%
We're going to discover
the single truth that

00:30:43.810 --> 00:30:47.260 align:middle line:84%
has been so fundamental to
every ancient technological and

00:30:47.260 --> 00:30:49.610 align:middle line:84%
indigenous civilization
in the past.

00:30:49.610 --> 00:30:53.290 align:middle line:84%
It's a deep truth that a
new discovery is forcing

00:30:53.290 --> 00:30:56.470 align:middle line:90%
modern science now to embrace.
