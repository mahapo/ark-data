00:00:24.924 --> 00:00:25.840 align:middle line:90%
>>GREGG BRADEN: Hello.

00:00:25.840 --> 00:00:27.340 align:middle line:10%
My name's Gregg
Braden, and I'd like

00:00:27.340 --> 00:00:29.830 align:middle line:10%
to welcome you to this all
new episode of "The Divine

00:00:29.830 --> 00:00:33.970 align:middle line:10%
Matrix," Bridging Time,
Space, Miracles, and Belief.

00:00:33.970 --> 00:00:35.860 align:middle line:84%
In the last episode,
we explored what

00:00:35.860 --> 00:00:38.470 align:middle line:84%
it means to live in
a reflected reality,

00:00:38.470 --> 00:00:41.320 align:middle line:84%
where our truest thoughts,
feelings, and emotions,

00:00:41.320 --> 00:00:45.880 align:middle line:84%
and our beliefs are reflected
in the outer canvas of the world

00:00:45.880 --> 00:00:48.050 align:middle line:90%
around us, the Divine Matrix.

00:00:48.050 --> 00:00:50.710 align:middle line:84%
I also identified an
even deeper mystery

00:00:50.710 --> 00:00:53.170 align:middle line:84%
that allows us to give
and receive messages

00:00:53.170 --> 00:00:54.430 align:middle line:90%
from the matrix--

00:00:54.430 --> 00:00:57.100 align:middle line:90%
the mystery of time itself.

00:00:57.100 --> 00:00:58.960 align:middle line:84%
Well, in this
episode, I'll share

00:00:58.960 --> 00:01:01.030 align:middle line:84%
the discovery that
has forced scientists

00:01:01.030 --> 00:01:03.010 align:middle line:84%
to reconsider the way
they think of time,

00:01:03.010 --> 00:01:07.020 align:middle line:84%
as well as our
relationship to it.

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:10.320 align:middle line:84%
In the mid-1990s, I was
traveling with my group

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:14.010 align:middle line:84%
in Egypt when we experienced
something that cannot be

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:16.020 align:middle line:84%
explained by
conventional physics.

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:18.630 align:middle line:84%
At least, the way we
know physics today.

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:20.260 align:middle line:90%
Yet, the experience happened.

00:01:20.260 --> 00:01:23.190 align:middle line:84%
And it happened to the
50-plus people in our group.

00:01:23.190 --> 00:01:25.200 align:middle line:84%
It happened to the
Egyptian guides

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:26.490 align:middle line:90%
that were accompanying us.

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:30.480 align:middle line:84%
And it even happened to the
military convoy, both the one

00:01:30.480 --> 00:01:33.540 align:middle line:84%
in front and behind us that was
escorting us across the Sinai

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:35.940 align:middle line:90%
Desert into Cairo.

00:01:35.940 --> 00:01:39.360 align:middle line:84%
I had just been with
this group for two weeks.

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:41.890 align:middle line:84%
For two weeks, we had journeyed
through this mystical land

00:01:41.890 --> 00:01:42.690 align:middle line:90%
together.

00:01:42.690 --> 00:01:46.950 align:middle line:84%
We traveled down the Nile River,
experiencing all the temples

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:50.250 align:middle line:84%
along the Nile, into
Luxor, into the West Bank

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:52.380 align:middle line:90%
of the Nile, Tut's Tomb.

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:54.620 align:middle line:90%
We'd had an amazing experience.

00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:56.370 align:middle line:84%
And I'm sharing this
with you because it's

00:01:56.370 --> 00:01:57.930 align:middle line:84%
through these kinds
of experiences

00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:00.690 align:middle line:84%
that we bond together
with one another.

00:02:00.690 --> 00:02:02.940 align:middle line:84%
We find this with our
friends, with our families.

00:02:02.940 --> 00:02:04.530 align:middle line:90%
We bond in heart and in mind.

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:06.900 align:middle line:84%
And that's going to be
important to the experience

00:02:06.900 --> 00:02:09.400 align:middle line:84%
that I'm going to
describe in just a moment.

00:02:09.400 --> 00:02:12.880 align:middle line:84%
Well, from the foundation
of this bonding

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:14.880 align:middle line:84%
and this experience
that we'd had together,

00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:16.740 align:middle line:90%
we'd travel back to Cairo.

00:02:16.740 --> 00:02:19.290 align:middle line:10%
And we had driven
the eight-plus hours

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:22.260 align:middle line:10%
that it takes to go
across the Sinai,

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:26.190 align:middle line:10%
underneath the Suez Canal,
up to the top of the mountain

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:27.840 align:middle line:10%
on the Sinai Peninsula
that is known

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:30.490 align:middle line:10%
as Mount Sinai, Moses Mountain.

00:02:30.490 --> 00:02:33.300 align:middle line:10%
And we had spent time
together on Moses Mountain

00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:36.639 align:middle line:10%
and the magnificent monastery,
the Saint Catherine's Monastery

00:02:36.639 --> 00:02:37.680 align:middle line:10%
that's right at the base.

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:40.440 align:middle line:84%
We had hiked to the top
of the mountain at sunset.

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:44.160 align:middle line:84%
And all of these amazing,
beautiful, powerful, magical,

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:46.660 align:middle line:84%
mystical experiences
brought this group together

00:02:46.660 --> 00:02:49.370 align:middle line:90%
in a really powerful way.

00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:51.650 align:middle line:84%
From these experiences,
we were ready now

00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:55.040 align:middle line:84%
to make the journey
back across that desert,

00:02:55.040 --> 00:02:57.200 align:middle line:84%
that eight-hour
drive, and we were

00:02:57.200 --> 00:03:01.310 align:middle line:84%
going to go directly to
what many people considered

00:03:01.310 --> 00:03:03.360 align:middle line:84%
the reason that they
had come to Egypt.

00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:05.900 align:middle line:84%
We were going to go directly
to the Great Pyramid

00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:08.540 align:middle line:90%
on the plateau of Giza.

00:03:08.540 --> 00:03:10.010 align:middle line:84%
And we had been
given permission--

00:03:10.010 --> 00:03:12.380 align:middle line:90%
and again, this is in the 1990s.

00:03:12.380 --> 00:03:15.080 align:middle line:84%
We'd been given permission
for our entire group

00:03:15.080 --> 00:03:18.470 align:middle line:84%
to go inside the pyramid and
have the doors close behind us

00:03:18.470 --> 00:03:22.310 align:middle line:84%
and have all of the
chambers available to us

00:03:22.310 --> 00:03:23.540 align:middle line:90%
for almost six hours.

00:03:23.540 --> 00:03:26.330 align:middle line:84%
And the anticipation
was palpable.

00:03:26.330 --> 00:03:30.560 align:middle line:84%
Everyone was so excited to be
inside of the Great Pyramid.

00:03:30.560 --> 00:03:33.350 align:middle line:84%
So while we were
making the drive back--

00:03:33.350 --> 00:03:35.570 align:middle line:84%
we'd left Saint
Catherine's Monastery.

00:03:35.570 --> 00:03:37.040 align:middle line:90%
We were driving along the road.

00:03:37.040 --> 00:03:39.320 align:middle line:90%
The Red Sea was to one side.

00:03:39.320 --> 00:03:41.240 align:middle line:84%
We went through the
military checkpoints

00:03:41.240 --> 00:03:43.790 align:middle line:84%
about every 20 minutes
at that time, where

00:03:43.790 --> 00:03:45.090 align:middle line:90%
they would check passports.

00:03:45.090 --> 00:03:48.590 align:middle line:84%
They would check just to make
sure that everything was OK.

00:03:48.590 --> 00:03:51.170 align:middle line:84%
And I'm sharing this part of
the experience, because all

00:03:51.170 --> 00:03:55.070 align:middle line:84%
of these things added
time to the journey,

00:03:55.070 --> 00:03:59.360 align:middle line:84%
and time that should have
been a factor in when

00:03:59.360 --> 00:04:01.220 align:middle line:90%
we arrived in Cairo.

00:04:01.220 --> 00:04:04.505 align:middle line:10%
All of a sudden,
the bus stopped.

00:04:04.505 --> 00:04:06.630 align:middle line:10%
And I was in conversation
with a friend next to me,

00:04:06.630 --> 00:04:09.890 align:middle line:10%
and I didn't pay much
attention, because I assumed

00:04:09.890 --> 00:04:11.889 align:middle line:10%
it was just another checkpoint.

00:04:11.889 --> 00:04:14.180 align:middle line:84%
But the bus stopped, and this
time, something different

00:04:14.180 --> 00:04:14.980 align:middle line:90%
happened.

00:04:14.980 --> 00:04:18.260 align:middle line:84%
I heard voices outside, and
I looked out the window.

00:04:18.260 --> 00:04:20.240 align:middle line:84%
And from the troop
carrier that was in front

00:04:20.240 --> 00:04:21.630 align:middle line:90%
of us, the military convoy--

00:04:21.630 --> 00:04:25.700 align:middle line:84%
it was a large pickup
with a canvas cover--

00:04:25.700 --> 00:04:29.264 align:middle line:84%
I saw the military men
coming out from the truck.

00:04:29.264 --> 00:04:30.680 align:middle line:84%
They were milling
around the road,

00:04:30.680 --> 00:04:32.780 align:middle line:84%
and everybody was
looking at their watch.

00:04:32.780 --> 00:04:35.360 align:middle line:84%
And I looked in the mirrors,
the rearview mirrors of the bus,

00:04:35.360 --> 00:04:37.739 align:middle line:84%
and I could see that the
troop carrier behind us

00:04:37.739 --> 00:04:38.780 align:middle line:90%
was doing the same thing.

00:04:38.780 --> 00:04:43.130 align:middle line:84%
These soldiers were just
looking totally mystified.

00:04:43.130 --> 00:04:46.880 align:middle line:84%
My driver left the bus, and
he was talking with my guide.

00:04:46.880 --> 00:04:49.290 align:middle line:84%
And that was when I
knew something was up.

00:04:49.290 --> 00:04:51.050 align:middle line:84%
So I got off the
bus, and I went down

00:04:51.050 --> 00:04:53.380 align:middle line:84%
and I asked my guy--
his name was Mohammed.

00:04:53.380 --> 00:04:54.954 align:middle line:84%
Mohammed, I said,
what's going on?

00:04:54.954 --> 00:04:56.120 align:middle line:90%
I said, why have we stopped?

00:04:56.120 --> 00:04:58.080 align:middle line:90%
Why is everybody milling around?

00:04:58.080 --> 00:05:00.020 align:middle line:84%
Why does everybody
look so confused?

00:05:00.020 --> 00:05:02.300 align:middle line:84%
And he said, look where
we are, my brother.

00:05:02.300 --> 00:05:05.420 align:middle line:90%


00:05:05.420 --> 00:05:08.970 align:middle line:84%
And I said, we are in front of
Sadat's tomb, President Sadat's

00:05:08.970 --> 00:05:09.770 align:middle line:90%
tomb.

00:05:09.770 --> 00:05:14.250 align:middle line:84%
It is a very well-known marker,
but it's in the city of Cairo.

00:05:14.250 --> 00:05:16.130 align:middle line:84%
And I said, here we
are at Sadat's tomb.

00:05:16.130 --> 00:05:17.020 align:middle line:90%
We made good time.

00:05:17.020 --> 00:05:18.151 align:middle line:90%
And he says, no.

00:05:18.151 --> 00:05:19.400 align:middle line:90%
He said, you don't understand.

00:05:19.400 --> 00:05:21.200 align:middle line:90%
He said, we can't be here.

00:05:21.200 --> 00:05:22.880 align:middle line:90%
We cannot be here yet.

00:05:22.880 --> 00:05:25.850 align:middle line:84%
He said, it takes at
least seven to eight hours

00:05:25.850 --> 00:05:29.150 align:middle line:84%
to make this journey, as we
made last week when we came out.

00:05:29.150 --> 00:05:31.610 align:middle line:84%
He said, it's only
been four hours.

00:05:31.610 --> 00:05:35.090 align:middle line:84%
It's only been four hours
since we left Saint Catherine's

00:05:35.090 --> 00:05:36.770 align:middle line:90%
Monastery.

00:05:36.770 --> 00:05:38.630 align:middle line:90%
That's the point of this story.

00:05:38.630 --> 00:05:42.500 align:middle line:84%
It's a beautiful example of
our relationship to time.

00:05:42.500 --> 00:05:47.030 align:middle line:84%
What had happened in that
experience in Egypt is this.

00:05:47.030 --> 00:05:50.390 align:middle line:84%
And maybe you've had this
kind of experience yourself.

00:05:50.390 --> 00:05:54.890 align:middle line:84%
What happened was it was
the anticipation, the mental

00:05:54.890 --> 00:05:58.490 align:middle line:84%
and the emotional
anticipation of everyone

00:05:58.490 --> 00:06:01.310 align:middle line:84%
in this group, the 50-plus
people in this group,

00:06:01.310 --> 00:06:05.840 align:middle line:84%
as a combined consciousness
in their hearts

00:06:05.840 --> 00:06:06.710 align:middle line:90%
and in their minds.

00:06:06.710 --> 00:06:08.870 align:middle line:84%
They were so
excited to be inside

00:06:08.870 --> 00:06:11.520 align:middle line:84%
of the Great Pyramid in
their minds and their hearts,

00:06:11.520 --> 00:06:12.654 align:middle line:90%
they were already there.

00:06:12.654 --> 00:06:14.320 align:middle line:84%
Now, there's a powerful
difference here.

00:06:14.320 --> 00:06:17.210 align:middle line:90%
I'm going to make a distinction.

00:06:17.210 --> 00:06:19.970 align:middle line:84%
There's a powerful
difference between feeling

00:06:19.970 --> 00:06:24.830 align:middle line:84%
that you're already there
and feeling that this trip is

00:06:24.830 --> 00:06:25.640 align:middle line:90%
taking forever.

00:06:25.640 --> 00:06:27.110 align:middle line:90%
This trip is dragging on.

00:06:27.110 --> 00:06:29.900 align:middle line:84%
When are we finally
going to get there?

00:06:29.900 --> 00:06:33.410 align:middle line:84%
The emotional anticipation
and the feeling

00:06:33.410 --> 00:06:36.360 align:middle line:84%
that we were already
in this pyramid--

00:06:36.360 --> 00:06:39.440 align:middle line:84%
that we're feeling what it
would be like to be inside

00:06:39.440 --> 00:06:42.560 align:middle line:84%
of this mystical monument that
most of us have seen since we

00:06:42.560 --> 00:06:43.580 align:middle line:90%
were children.

00:06:43.580 --> 00:06:45.200 align:middle line:84%
We've seen it in
the pages of books.

00:06:45.200 --> 00:06:47.990 align:middle line:84%
They were feeling what
this would feel like.

00:06:47.990 --> 00:06:49.970 align:middle line:84%
What we now know,
through the science

00:06:49.970 --> 00:06:52.610 align:middle line:84%
and what I'm going to share
with you through this episode,

00:06:52.610 --> 00:06:56.570 align:middle line:84%
is how this emotional
component of our experience

00:06:56.570 --> 00:07:00.380 align:middle line:84%
ties into the mystery
of time on a level

00:07:00.380 --> 00:07:03.200 align:middle line:84%
where time becomes
insignificant.

00:07:03.200 --> 00:07:05.720 align:middle line:84%
So what I mean by
that is when we

00:07:05.720 --> 00:07:08.054 align:middle line:90%
are experiencing linear time--

00:07:08.054 --> 00:07:09.470 align:middle line:84%
and that's the
thinking that says,

00:07:09.470 --> 00:07:11.600 align:middle line:84%
man, this is taking
forever to get from point A

00:07:11.600 --> 00:07:14.780 align:middle line:84%
to point B. I can't
wait until we're there.

00:07:14.780 --> 00:07:17.600 align:middle line:84%
That's very different
than the emotional,

00:07:17.600 --> 00:07:21.800 align:middle line:84%
the heart-based experience
of actually feeling

00:07:21.800 --> 00:07:25.100 align:middle line:84%
that we are at the place
that we have arrived.

00:07:25.100 --> 00:07:28.040 align:middle line:84%
We are at the place
that ends our journey.

00:07:28.040 --> 00:07:31.100 align:middle line:84%
Because that emotion,
science is now telling us,

00:07:31.100 --> 00:07:35.000 align:middle line:84%
is occurring on a quantum level,
and it's happening at a place

00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:40.730 align:middle line:84%
where new discoveries have told
us that time is insignificant,

00:07:40.730 --> 00:07:44.750 align:middle line:84%
that time is
essentially meaningless.

00:07:44.750 --> 00:07:48.560 align:middle line:84%
Time either seems to speed up
and pass too quickly when we're

00:07:48.560 --> 00:07:50.270 align:middle line:84%
enjoying something
that we really love

00:07:50.270 --> 00:07:53.099 align:middle line:84%
or if we're spending time
with someone that we really

00:07:53.099 --> 00:07:54.140 align:middle line:90%
enjoy spending time with.

00:07:54.140 --> 00:07:56.348 align:middle line:84%
Or maybe just the opposite
maybe has happened to you.

00:07:56.348 --> 00:08:00.200 align:middle line:84%
Maybe time seemed to slow down
and drag through an experience

00:08:00.200 --> 00:08:01.700 align:middle line:90%
that you really didn't enjoy.

00:08:01.700 --> 00:08:04.580 align:middle line:84%
Well, in either
situation, your experience

00:08:04.580 --> 00:08:07.040 align:middle line:84%
was subjective, just like
the people on the bus.

00:08:07.040 --> 00:08:10.430 align:middle line:84%
And while the time shift
definitely happened for you

00:08:10.430 --> 00:08:12.530 align:middle line:84%
in your experience, it
may not have happened

00:08:12.530 --> 00:08:13.740 align:middle line:90%
for the people around you.

00:08:13.740 --> 00:08:15.980 align:middle line:84%
And that's the point of
what I'm saying here.

00:08:15.980 --> 00:08:19.930 align:middle line:84%
Our experience of time, what
happened to us on the bus,

00:08:19.930 --> 00:08:22.760 align:middle line:84%
it involved not only
us, but the field

00:08:22.760 --> 00:08:26.660 align:middle line:84%
influenced even the military
people in separate vehicles

00:08:26.660 --> 00:08:29.000 align:middle line:84%
that were in front
and behind our bus.

00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:33.049 align:middle line:84%
Our experience of time
appears to be directly linked

00:08:33.049 --> 00:08:36.247 align:middle line:84%
to our personal as well as
our collective experience.

00:08:36.247 --> 00:08:38.330 align:middle line:84%
And that is precisely what
happened with the group

00:08:38.330 --> 00:08:39.780 align:middle line:90%
in Egypt.

00:08:39.780 --> 00:08:41.196 align:middle line:90%
So time.

00:08:41.196 --> 00:08:42.820 align:middle line:84%
This is what this
episode is all about.

00:08:42.820 --> 00:08:44.630 align:middle line:90%
Every day, we talk about time.

00:08:44.630 --> 00:08:45.980 align:middle line:90%
We use it.

00:08:45.980 --> 00:08:47.180 align:middle line:90%
We try to save time.

00:08:47.180 --> 00:08:50.120 align:middle line:84%
We even have what we call
daylight savings time.

00:08:50.120 --> 00:08:52.230 align:middle line:90%
It fills our lives.

00:08:52.230 --> 00:08:55.370 align:middle line:84%
But we've never been
able to truly define

00:08:55.370 --> 00:08:56.360 align:middle line:90%
the mystery of time.

00:08:56.360 --> 00:09:00.350 align:middle line:90%


00:09:00.350 --> 00:09:03.500 align:middle line:84%
For the first time,
science is making inroads

00:09:03.500 --> 00:09:06.920 align:middle line:84%
to solving this mysterious
quality of our lives.

00:09:06.920 --> 00:09:10.250 align:middle line:84%
Science has historically
held two very different views

00:09:10.250 --> 00:09:13.730 align:middle line:84%
of what time is and what
it means in our lives.

00:09:13.730 --> 00:09:16.490 align:middle line:84%
Professor John Wheeler,
Princeton University,

00:09:16.490 --> 00:09:18.590 align:middle line:84%
the physicist and
colleague of Einstein

00:09:18.590 --> 00:09:21.170 align:middle line:84%
that I mentioned earlier
in this program--

00:09:21.170 --> 00:09:24.950 align:middle line:84%
he offered an obvious, yet
very functional view of time

00:09:24.950 --> 00:09:27.050 align:middle line:84%
when he said-- and
this is a quote.

00:09:27.050 --> 00:09:29.210 align:middle line:84%
He defined time by
saying, "Time is

00:09:29.210 --> 00:09:31.280 align:middle line:84%
nature's way of
keeping everything

00:09:31.280 --> 00:09:33.050 align:middle line:90%
from happening all at once."

00:09:33.050 --> 00:09:34.310 align:middle line:90%
End of quote.

00:09:34.310 --> 00:09:37.490 align:middle line:84%
When we think about it,
he's precisely correct.

00:09:37.490 --> 00:09:41.450 align:middle line:84%
Wheeler's view of time echoes
the traditional qualities

00:09:41.450 --> 00:09:44.900 align:middle line:84%
of time held by what we
call classical physics.

00:09:44.900 --> 00:09:49.220 align:middle line:10%
Those qualities tell us that
time, number one, is absolute,

00:09:49.220 --> 00:09:52.400 align:middle line:10%
that it is an absolute quality
that cannot be changed.

00:09:52.400 --> 00:09:55.570 align:middle line:84%
And number two, that
time is universal.

00:09:55.570 --> 00:09:57.980 align:middle line:84%
That no matter
where we are, time

00:09:57.980 --> 00:10:01.190 align:middle line:84%
exists, at the very large
scales of the universe,

00:10:01.190 --> 00:10:02.990 align:middle line:84%
at the very small
scales of the universe,

00:10:02.990 --> 00:10:05.550 align:middle line:84%
at the farthest
reaches of the cosmos.

00:10:05.550 --> 00:10:06.350 align:middle line:90%
All right.

00:10:06.350 --> 00:10:08.330 align:middle line:84%
So these are the
traditional views.

00:10:08.330 --> 00:10:12.410 align:middle line:84%
Now, not surprisingly, Wheeler's
friend and his colleague,

00:10:12.410 --> 00:10:14.540 align:middle line:90%
his peer, Albert Einstein--

00:10:14.540 --> 00:10:17.330 align:middle line:84%
again, they studied at
the same university.

00:10:17.330 --> 00:10:18.980 align:middle line:84%
They were using
the same equations.

00:10:18.980 --> 00:10:20.750 align:middle line:90%
They had the same mathematics.

00:10:20.750 --> 00:10:22.530 align:middle line:84%
They had very, very
different viewpoints,

00:10:22.530 --> 00:10:25.190 align:middle line:84%
as we saw earlier
in another episode.

00:10:25.190 --> 00:10:27.590 align:middle line:84%
Einstein offered a very
different view of time,

00:10:27.590 --> 00:10:30.590 align:middle line:84%
and it was based upon
his theory of relativity

00:10:30.590 --> 00:10:32.030 align:middle line:90%
that he was developing.

00:10:32.030 --> 00:10:33.980 align:middle line:84%
Einstein said, number
one-- no surprise--

00:10:33.980 --> 00:10:37.100 align:middle line:84%
that time is
relative, that it is

00:10:37.100 --> 00:10:40.540 align:middle line:84%
dependent upon the observer and
the experience of the observer.

00:10:40.540 --> 00:10:44.960 align:middle line:84%
And number two, Einstein
said that time is malleable.

00:10:44.960 --> 00:10:47.840 align:middle line:10%
So in Einstein's
very famous theories,

00:10:47.840 --> 00:10:51.320 align:middle line:10%
he considered time in a
way that science had never

00:10:51.320 --> 00:10:53.480 align:middle line:10%
thought of time in the past.

00:10:53.480 --> 00:10:56.150 align:middle line:84%
What Einstein said is that
when we think of time--

00:10:56.150 --> 00:11:00.860 align:middle line:84%
and this is very important--
he said we cannot separate time

00:11:00.860 --> 00:11:05.297 align:middle line:84%
from the space that the events
of time are traveling through.

00:11:05.297 --> 00:11:07.130 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to invite you
to think about that.

00:11:07.130 --> 00:11:11.330 align:middle line:84%
We cannot separate the time
from the things that are

00:11:11.330 --> 00:11:13.850 align:middle line:90%
experiencing the time.

00:11:13.850 --> 00:11:15.740 align:middle line:84%
And it was this thinking
that led Einstein

00:11:15.740 --> 00:11:20.210 align:middle line:84%
to coin the very famous
term space-time, mirroring

00:11:20.210 --> 00:11:24.650 align:middle line:84%
this belief that time and
space are forever related.

00:11:24.650 --> 00:11:29.090 align:middle line:84%
They are married as a higher
dimension, a fourth dimension

00:11:29.090 --> 00:11:30.800 align:middle line:90%
of our experience.

00:11:30.800 --> 00:11:33.680 align:middle line:84%
Well, Einstein's view
of relative time--

00:11:33.680 --> 00:11:36.020 align:middle line:84%
it's reflected in a
really beautiful poem

00:11:36.020 --> 00:11:37.962 align:middle line:90%
by Henry van Dyke, the poet.

00:11:37.962 --> 00:11:39.920 align:middle line:84%
And the poem-- let me
just share this with you,

00:11:39.920 --> 00:11:41.600 align:middle line:90%
because it's so true.

00:11:41.600 --> 00:11:45.890 align:middle line:84%
What van Dyke said was that
"time is too slow for those who

00:11:45.890 --> 00:11:48.560 align:middle line:84%
wait, time is too
swift for those

00:11:48.560 --> 00:11:52.760 align:middle line:84%
who fear, too long for those who
grieve, but for those who love,

00:11:52.760 --> 00:11:54.530 align:middle line:90%
time is an eternity."

00:11:54.530 --> 00:11:57.320 align:middle line:84%
You may recognize those
words as the lyrics

00:11:57.320 --> 00:11:59.120 align:middle line:84%
of a very famous
song in the 1980s

00:11:59.120 --> 00:12:01.500 align:middle line:84%
by a group called
"It's a Beautiful Day."

00:12:01.500 --> 00:12:05.510 align:middle line:84%
So the scientific study
of time has led scientists

00:12:05.510 --> 00:12:10.760 align:middle line:84%
to ask questions about just
what is the nature of time.

00:12:10.760 --> 00:12:12.440 align:middle line:90%
Is it a force?

00:12:12.440 --> 00:12:15.500 align:middle line:84%
Is time a force, something
that can be measured,

00:12:15.500 --> 00:12:17.960 align:middle line:90%
like the force of gravity?

00:12:17.960 --> 00:12:21.080 align:middle line:90%
Is time merely a perception?

00:12:21.080 --> 00:12:23.360 align:middle line:84%
Is it ours, something that
we manage and control?

00:12:23.360 --> 00:12:26.870 align:middle line:84%
If we weren't even
here, would time exist?

00:12:26.870 --> 00:12:30.290 align:middle line:84%
Like, if you weren't in a
forest to hear the tree fall,

00:12:30.290 --> 00:12:32.390 align:middle line:90%
would it make a sound?

00:12:32.390 --> 00:12:34.100 align:middle line:10%
1967.

00:12:34.100 --> 00:12:36.620 align:middle line:10%
John Wheeler and
another physicist--

00:12:36.620 --> 00:12:38.630 align:middle line:10%
his name was DeWitt--

00:12:38.630 --> 00:12:40.910 align:middle line:10%
they developed an
equation that is now

00:12:40.910 --> 00:12:43.910 align:middle line:10%
a very famous equation
in their attempt

00:12:43.910 --> 00:12:47.330 align:middle line:10%
to solve one of the problems
that has plagued scientists

00:12:47.330 --> 00:12:51.680 align:middle line:10%
from the beginning of the
time that physics was created.

00:12:51.680 --> 00:12:54.950 align:middle line:84%
It is the problem of
trying to unify the two

00:12:54.950 --> 00:12:58.040 align:middle line:84%
different schools of physics,
classical physics and quantum

00:12:58.040 --> 00:12:59.180 align:middle line:90%
physics.

00:12:59.180 --> 00:13:01.370 align:middle line:84%
To this day,
scientists are still

00:13:01.370 --> 00:13:04.730 align:middle line:84%
searching for this
elusive unified field

00:13:04.730 --> 00:13:08.570 align:middle line:84%
theory, where the laws of
the very small in the quantum

00:13:08.570 --> 00:13:12.170 align:middle line:84%
world and what we see happening
in the very large world

00:13:12.170 --> 00:13:16.430 align:middle line:84%
of galaxies and
the universe, where

00:13:16.430 --> 00:13:20.730 align:middle line:84%
those laws can be merged into
a single, beautiful, elegant

00:13:20.730 --> 00:13:21.530 align:middle line:90%
story.

00:13:21.530 --> 00:13:22.995 align:middle line:90%
It hasn't happened yet.

00:13:22.995 --> 00:13:28.250 align:middle line:84%
In 1967, Wheeler and
DeWitt created an equation

00:13:28.250 --> 00:13:32.000 align:middle line:84%
where they did, in fact,
solve this mysterious problem.

00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:34.010 align:middle line:84%
And in solving the
mystery of what

00:13:34.010 --> 00:13:36.650 align:middle line:84%
it takes to unify these two
different kinds of physics,

00:13:36.650 --> 00:13:38.810 align:middle line:84%
they made a
discovery that opened

00:13:38.810 --> 00:13:42.080 align:middle line:84%
a door to a
mind-boggling possibility

00:13:42.080 --> 00:13:44.070 align:middle line:90%
when it comes to time.

00:13:44.070 --> 00:13:47.725 align:middle line:84%
So the Wheeler-DeWitt equation,
as it's called-- it's elegant.

00:13:47.725 --> 00:13:49.350 align:middle line:90%
It's simple.

00:13:49.350 --> 00:13:52.400 align:middle line:84%
It works really, really
well, beautifully.

00:13:52.400 --> 00:13:55.550 align:middle line:84%
However, there is one small
glitch, one small catch

00:13:55.550 --> 00:13:57.740 align:middle line:90%
to the success of the equation.

00:13:57.740 --> 00:14:02.840 align:middle line:84%
It only works when time is
left out of the calculations.

00:14:02.840 --> 00:14:07.790 align:middle line:84%
If they throw the quality of
time out of the calculations,

00:14:07.790 --> 00:14:09.440 align:middle line:84%
all of the numbers,
all the equations,

00:14:09.440 --> 00:14:12.440 align:middle line:84%
all the factors fall
into place perfectly.

00:14:12.440 --> 00:14:14.900 align:middle line:84%
Everything else in
the equation reflects

00:14:14.900 --> 00:14:17.590 align:middle line:84%
what scientists accept to
be true about the world

00:14:17.590 --> 00:14:18.390 align:middle line:90%
as we know it.

00:14:18.390 --> 00:14:22.460 align:middle line:84%
It's just that time itself
does not seem to fit.

00:14:22.460 --> 00:14:24.170 align:middle line:90%
So this is a quandary.

00:14:24.170 --> 00:14:26.900 align:middle line:84%
And this is a quandary that has
led to the obvious question,

00:14:26.900 --> 00:14:28.820 align:middle line:90%
is time even real?

00:14:28.820 --> 00:14:31.190 align:middle line:90%
Is it as universal as we think?

00:14:31.190 --> 00:14:34.930 align:middle line:90%
Does it really exist everywhere?

00:14:34.930 --> 00:14:38.450 align:middle line:84%
At the Max Planck Institute
of Quantum Optics--

00:14:38.450 --> 00:14:42.040 align:middle line:84%
this is a leading
research institution

00:14:42.040 --> 00:14:44.410 align:middle line:84%
studying things
that are happening

00:14:44.410 --> 00:14:47.440 align:middle line:84%
on the very, very small
level of the quantum world--

00:14:47.440 --> 00:14:51.160 align:middle line:84%
scientists are exploring
quantum time, the tiniest units

00:14:51.160 --> 00:14:53.140 align:middle line:84%
of time imaginable,
in an attempt

00:14:53.140 --> 00:14:55.120 align:middle line:90%
to answer these questions.

00:14:55.120 --> 00:14:56.920 align:middle line:84%
I want to share with
you what they found,

00:14:56.920 --> 00:14:58.840 align:middle line:84%
because what they
found is forcing

00:14:58.840 --> 00:15:02.500 align:middle line:84%
the scientific community
to rethink everything

00:15:02.500 --> 00:15:06.250 align:middle line:84%
that they believed to be
true about time in the past.

00:15:06.250 --> 00:15:09.190 align:middle line:84%
The scientists at the
Institute discovered a place

00:15:09.190 --> 00:15:11.950 align:middle line:84%
where time appears
to be meaningless

00:15:11.950 --> 00:15:14.530 align:middle line:90%
and is essentially non-existent.

00:15:14.530 --> 00:15:16.880 align:middle line:84%
They found a place
where, essentially, time

00:15:16.880 --> 00:15:17.680 align:middle line:90%
doesn't exist.

00:15:17.680 --> 00:15:22.210 align:middle line:10%
This mysterious realm
is known as Planck time,

00:15:22.210 --> 00:15:25.940 align:middle line:10%
and it is described
as a scale of events

00:15:25.940 --> 00:15:27.160 align:middle line:10%
that's very, very small.

00:15:27.160 --> 00:15:29.590 align:middle line:10%
It measures-- I'll just
give you the measurement--

00:15:29.590 --> 00:15:33.930 align:middle line:10%
10 to the minus 43 seconds.

00:15:33.930 --> 00:15:36.830 align:middle line:10%
So if something is
happening and the time

00:15:36.830 --> 00:15:38.720 align:middle line:10%
between the beginning
of that something

00:15:38.720 --> 00:15:43.730 align:middle line:10%
and the end of that something
falls within this realm of 10

00:15:43.730 --> 00:15:45.950 align:middle line:10%
to the minus 43 seconds--
just to give you

00:15:45.950 --> 00:15:48.680 align:middle line:10%
an idea of what this
is, that is a minus 10

00:15:48.680 --> 00:15:51.380 align:middle line:10%
followed by 43 zeros.

00:15:51.380 --> 00:15:54.470 align:middle line:10%
If something is happening on
that scale, this quantum scale,

00:15:54.470 --> 00:15:58.810 align:middle line:10%
for all intents and all
purposes, time does not exist.

00:15:58.810 --> 00:16:00.800 align:middle line:84%
Now, this is an
important discovery,

00:16:00.800 --> 00:16:03.530 align:middle line:84%
because it suggests
that time may not

00:16:03.530 --> 00:16:05.430 align:middle line:90%
be what we think it is at all.

00:16:05.430 --> 00:16:09.270 align:middle line:84%
It may not be as universal as
we have thought in the past.

00:16:09.270 --> 00:16:11.180 align:middle line:84%
And there are a number
of physicists now

00:16:11.180 --> 00:16:12.890 align:middle line:84%
that are on board
with this thinking.

00:16:12.890 --> 00:16:16.890 align:middle line:84%
The theoretical Italian
physicist Carlo Rovelli--

00:16:16.890 --> 00:16:17.690 align:middle line:90%
he agrees.

00:16:17.690 --> 00:16:19.231 align:middle line:10%
And I want to share
with you a quote.

00:16:19.231 --> 00:16:20.930 align:middle line:10%
He said, "It may
be that the best

00:16:20.930 --> 00:16:23.570 align:middle line:10%
way to think about
quantum reality

00:16:23.570 --> 00:16:26.600 align:middle line:10%
is to give up the
notion of time."

00:16:26.600 --> 00:16:29.330 align:middle line:10%
He said, "the fundamental
description of the universe

00:16:29.330 --> 00:16:31.610 align:middle line:10%
must be timeless."

00:16:31.610 --> 00:16:33.550 align:middle line:10%
And that's the end of the quote.

00:16:33.550 --> 00:16:36.140 align:middle line:84%
Wow, that is a very
powerful statement.

00:16:36.140 --> 00:16:39.110 align:middle line:84%
That, again, is like an
earthquake reverberating

00:16:39.110 --> 00:16:40.790 align:middle line:84%
through the world
of physics, who

00:16:40.790 --> 00:16:46.760 align:middle line:84%
has struggled with this curious
factor of time from the time

00:16:46.760 --> 00:16:48.317 align:middle line:90%
that physics began.

00:16:48.317 --> 00:16:50.150 align:middle line:84%
Well I want to share,
there's another reason

00:16:50.150 --> 00:16:52.820 align:middle line:84%
that the discovery of
this place where time

00:16:52.820 --> 00:16:55.420 align:middle line:90%
doesn't exist as we know it--

00:16:55.420 --> 00:16:58.220 align:middle line:84%
there's another reason
this is important.

00:16:58.220 --> 00:17:01.730 align:middle line:84%
Because the quantum realm,
where time appears to be

00:17:01.730 --> 00:17:04.190 align:middle line:84%
meaningless-- you're
going to love this--

00:17:04.190 --> 00:17:08.720 align:middle line:84%
it is precisely the place
where human emotion begins.

00:17:08.720 --> 00:17:11.960 align:middle line:84%
It's the place where
human emotion creates

00:17:11.960 --> 00:17:15.079 align:middle line:84%
the effects that appear
to be spontaneous,

00:17:15.079 --> 00:17:17.630 align:middle line:84%
like instantaneous healings,
for example, that appear

00:17:17.630 --> 00:17:20.240 align:middle line:84%
to be miracles that
we can't explain

00:17:20.240 --> 00:17:22.760 align:middle line:84%
or the intuition
between the mother

00:17:22.760 --> 00:17:25.819 align:middle line:84%
and her son in a battlefield
halfway around the world

00:17:25.819 --> 00:17:28.040 align:middle line:84%
that we talked about
in a previous episode.

00:17:28.040 --> 00:17:31.460 align:middle line:84%
Those things are happening
not in the everyday world.

00:17:31.460 --> 00:17:33.740 align:middle line:84%
They're happening in
the quantum world.

00:17:33.740 --> 00:17:35.900 align:middle line:84%
And this is the place
where the ideas of time

00:17:35.900 --> 00:17:37.400 align:middle line:90%
appear to break down.

00:17:37.400 --> 00:17:41.300 align:middle line:84%
Well, in season 2
of "Missing Links,"

00:17:41.300 --> 00:17:45.260 align:middle line:84%
we explored a growing body
of scientific evidence

00:17:45.260 --> 00:17:47.390 align:middle line:84%
that suggests that
we are living in what

00:17:47.390 --> 00:17:50.930 align:middle line:84%
is called a simulation
that is happening inside

00:17:50.930 --> 00:17:52.370 align:middle line:90%
of a virtual reality.

00:17:52.370 --> 00:17:54.670 align:middle line:84%
If you haven't seen
that season, I'm

00:17:54.670 --> 00:17:56.270 align:middle line:84%
going invite you
to check it out,

00:17:56.270 --> 00:17:58.670 align:middle line:84%
because it ties in
beautifully to everything

00:17:58.670 --> 00:18:00.260 align:middle line:84%
we're saying right
now about time.

00:18:00.260 --> 00:18:02.780 align:middle line:84%
And I'm going to take it one
step further with something

00:18:02.780 --> 00:18:05.330 align:middle line:84%
that I did not share,
because the information

00:18:05.330 --> 00:18:08.480 align:middle line:90%
wasn't available in season 2.

00:18:08.480 --> 00:18:13.590 align:middle line:84%
This idea that time is
unfolding within this simulation

00:18:13.590 --> 00:18:15.860 align:middle line:84%
and the evidence that
supports it has now

00:18:15.860 --> 00:18:19.100 align:middle line:84%
opened the door to a
new way of thinking

00:18:19.100 --> 00:18:21.890 align:middle line:84%
about the mysteries of
the universe itself.

00:18:21.890 --> 00:18:22.750 align:middle line:90%
What is prayer?

00:18:22.750 --> 00:18:23.550 align:middle line:90%
What is life?

00:18:23.550 --> 00:18:24.350 align:middle line:90%
What is death?

00:18:24.350 --> 00:18:25.490 align:middle line:90%
Who is God?

00:18:25.490 --> 00:18:26.960 align:middle line:84%
All of those take
on a new meaning

00:18:26.960 --> 00:18:30.380 align:middle line:84%
when we think about a
simulation in a virtual reality.

00:18:30.380 --> 00:18:35.750 align:middle line:84%
And the idea of time takes
on a whole new meaning.

00:18:35.750 --> 00:18:38.690 align:middle line:84%
From the perspective
of simulation theory,

00:18:38.690 --> 00:18:41.990 align:middle line:84%
the mystery of time
actually becomes easier

00:18:41.990 --> 00:18:44.660 align:middle line:84%
to explain in the
traditional sense.

00:18:44.660 --> 00:18:47.730 align:middle line:84%
And in doing so, it also
becomes even more mysterious.

00:18:47.730 --> 00:18:49.910 align:middle line:90%
And here here's what I mean.

00:18:49.910 --> 00:18:53.660 align:middle line:84%
In simulation theory,
time is thought

00:18:53.660 --> 00:19:00.800 align:middle line:84%
of as a program, a program that
is running under the operating

00:19:00.800 --> 00:19:04.007 align:middle line:84%
system that we would
call the Divine Matrix.

00:19:04.007 --> 00:19:06.590 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to invite you to think
about that just for a moment.

00:19:06.590 --> 00:19:09.320 align:middle line:84%
Think about what you know
about computers right now.

00:19:09.320 --> 00:19:11.660 align:middle line:84%
Every computer has
an operating system.

00:19:11.660 --> 00:19:14.390 align:middle line:84%
The Apple computers have
the Apple operating system.

00:19:14.390 --> 00:19:17.600 align:middle line:90%
The IBM computers have theirs.

00:19:17.600 --> 00:19:21.530 align:middle line:84%
The operating system
is the big system

00:19:21.530 --> 00:19:24.110 align:middle line:84%
that allows all of
your other programs

00:19:24.110 --> 00:19:26.150 align:middle line:90%
to run under those systems.

00:19:26.150 --> 00:19:28.880 align:middle line:10%
So all the applications
we're running,

00:19:28.880 --> 00:19:35.330 align:middle line:10%
all of your Facebook, and
YouTube, and PowerPoint,

00:19:35.330 --> 00:19:38.390 align:middle line:10%
and Word, and all of the things
that we run-- they're all

00:19:38.390 --> 00:19:41.371 align:middle line:10%
running within this
operating system, depending

00:19:41.371 --> 00:19:42.620 align:middle line:10%
what kind of computer we have.

00:19:42.620 --> 00:19:46.220 align:middle line:84%
So we can think of the
divine matrix, this quantum

00:19:46.220 --> 00:19:47.720 align:middle line:84%
field of energy,
this Higgs field

00:19:47.720 --> 00:19:50.720 align:middle line:84%
that we talked about
earlier in this series--

00:19:50.720 --> 00:19:52.590 align:middle line:90%
that's the operating system.

00:19:52.590 --> 00:19:56.090 align:middle line:84%
Now scientists are
considering time

00:19:56.090 --> 00:20:00.950 align:middle line:84%
as a program, a program
that has been designed,

00:20:00.950 --> 00:20:02.510 align:middle line:90%
a piece of software.

00:20:02.510 --> 00:20:05.480 align:middle line:84%
Very high level, very
sophisticated software.

00:20:05.480 --> 00:20:08.090 align:middle line:84%
Time is a program running
underneath that operating

00:20:08.090 --> 00:20:11.810 align:middle line:84%
system, and you and I are
living within that program.

00:20:11.810 --> 00:20:13.310 align:middle line:84%
It's this program,
they say, that is

00:20:13.310 --> 00:20:15.770 align:middle line:90%
driving our experience forward.

00:20:15.770 --> 00:20:18.860 align:middle line:84%
We talk about the
forward arrow of time.

00:20:18.860 --> 00:20:21.510 align:middle line:84%
Time always seems to be
moving in one direction.

00:20:21.510 --> 00:20:23.205 align:middle line:84%
However, the
mystery-- and Einstein

00:20:23.205 --> 00:20:25.580 align:middle line:84%
talked about this-- is there's
nothing that prevents time

00:20:25.580 --> 00:20:27.290 align:middle line:90%
from moving in reverse.

00:20:27.290 --> 00:20:29.460 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to talk about
that in just a minute.

00:20:29.460 --> 00:20:31.251 align:middle line:84%
So I'm just going to
acknowledge right now,

00:20:31.251 --> 00:20:34.760 align:middle line:84%
I know these are huge concepts,
and I'm covering them quickly

00:20:34.760 --> 00:20:37.170 align:middle line:84%
in a relatively
short period of time.

00:20:37.170 --> 00:20:39.680 align:middle line:84%
But I wanted to
introduce these concepts

00:20:39.680 --> 00:20:44.930 align:middle line:84%
so that you have the opportunity
to know that this idea of time

00:20:44.930 --> 00:20:47.330 align:middle line:84%
and what we think
about as time--

00:20:47.330 --> 00:20:48.600 align:middle line:90%
it's changing.

00:20:48.600 --> 00:20:50.000 align:middle line:90%
It's not set in stone.

00:20:50.000 --> 00:20:53.570 align:middle line:84%
And the new discoveries,
such as the possibility

00:20:53.570 --> 00:20:56.330 align:middle line:84%
of us living in a
simulated reality,

00:20:56.330 --> 00:20:58.350 align:middle line:90%
they have helped to unstuck us.

00:20:58.350 --> 00:20:59.150 align:middle line:90%
All right?

00:20:59.150 --> 00:21:02.480 align:middle line:84%
They are taking us out of
the rut of the old ways

00:21:02.480 --> 00:21:07.400 align:middle line:84%
of thinking and introducing new
ways and new possibilities that

00:21:07.400 --> 00:21:11.960 align:middle line:84%
are suddenly opening myriad
doors to new understandings.

00:21:11.960 --> 00:21:15.320 align:middle line:84%
And this, for me, is one of
the most exciting-- thinking

00:21:15.320 --> 00:21:18.570 align:middle line:90%
of time as a program.

00:21:18.570 --> 00:21:22.100 align:middle line:84%
So I wanted to introduce
these ideas and these concepts

00:21:22.100 --> 00:21:25.040 align:middle line:84%
here in this episode so that
we can tie into it later

00:21:25.040 --> 00:21:26.330 align:middle line:90%
in this series.

00:21:26.330 --> 00:21:28.700 align:middle line:84%
So interestingly,
the characteristics

00:21:28.700 --> 00:21:31.890 align:middle line:84%
of time and the way it flows,
they all support this idea.

00:21:31.890 --> 00:21:32.690 align:middle line:90%
Think about this.

00:21:32.690 --> 00:21:34.550 align:middle line:90%
Time has a beginning.

00:21:34.550 --> 00:21:36.290 align:middle line:90%
Time has an end.

00:21:36.290 --> 00:21:40.080 align:middle line:84%
Time unfolds as events that
follow repeating patterns.

00:21:40.080 --> 00:21:41.690 align:middle line:84%
These are all the
kinds of things

00:21:41.690 --> 00:21:44.150 align:middle line:84%
you would expect to see
happening in a program.

00:21:44.150 --> 00:21:46.820 align:middle line:84%
The patterns of time
repeat on different scales,

00:21:46.820 --> 00:21:48.380 align:middle line:90%
just as they would in a program.

00:21:48.380 --> 00:21:51.780 align:middle line:84%
They reoccur as cycles, just
as they would in a program.

00:21:51.780 --> 00:21:54.590 align:middle line:84%
We can move forward and we
can move backward in the time

00:21:54.590 --> 00:21:57.500 align:middle line:90%
program by shifting our focus.

00:21:57.500 --> 00:22:01.320 align:middle line:84%
Meditative techniques help
us to do precisely that.

00:22:01.320 --> 00:22:05.630 align:middle line:84%
So I'm going to share this new
model, a new way of thinking

00:22:05.630 --> 00:22:10.850 align:middle line:84%
about time, that may help to
give you a visual image of how

00:22:10.850 --> 00:22:13.280 align:middle line:84%
it's possible,
why it's possible,

00:22:13.280 --> 00:22:17.310 align:middle line:84%
for you to see the future
before it actually happens.

00:22:17.310 --> 00:22:19.880 align:middle line:84%
And I believe that will
illustrate this idea of time

00:22:19.880 --> 00:22:22.020 align:middle line:90%
as a program.

00:22:22.020 --> 00:22:23.810 align:middle line:84%
So a recent series
of experiments

00:22:23.810 --> 00:22:25.580 align:middle line:84%
from seven independent
laboratories

00:22:25.580 --> 00:22:28.820 align:middle line:84%
indicate that the
human body apparently

00:22:28.820 --> 00:22:33.020 align:middle line:84%
can detect time and
events that have happened

00:22:33.020 --> 00:22:36.830 align:middle line:84%
before they occur,
randomly delivered stimulus

00:22:36.830 --> 00:22:38.240 align:middle line:90%
from the future.

00:22:38.240 --> 00:22:41.240 align:middle line:84%
Now, the phenomenon, we
would call this prescient,

00:22:41.240 --> 00:22:43.280 align:middle line:90%
as in feeling in the future.

00:22:43.280 --> 00:22:45.050 align:middle line:10%
In the paper that
was released, they've

00:22:45.050 --> 00:22:46.580 align:middle line:10%
got a new term for this.

00:22:46.580 --> 00:22:48.710 align:middle line:90%
It is called PAA.

00:22:48.710 --> 00:22:54.210 align:middle line:84%
And PAA stands for Predictive
Anticipatory Activity.

00:22:54.210 --> 00:22:57.300 align:middle line:84%
So let me share with
you how it works.

00:22:57.300 --> 00:22:59.870 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to invite you to
visualize in your mind--

00:22:59.870 --> 00:23:02.330 align:middle line:84%
or maybe you can see
this on the screen--

00:23:02.330 --> 00:23:06.440 align:middle line:84%
if you can think
of time as a flow,

00:23:06.440 --> 00:23:08.410 align:middle line:90%
just like the flow of a river.

00:23:08.410 --> 00:23:11.180 align:middle line:84%
So think of time like
the flow of a river.

00:23:11.180 --> 00:23:13.222 align:middle line:84%
And the river is moving
in one direction.

00:23:13.222 --> 00:23:15.680 align:middle line:84%
So in this case, I'm going to
say it's moving from the left

00:23:15.680 --> 00:23:16.620 align:middle line:90%
to the right.

00:23:16.620 --> 00:23:17.420 align:middle line:90%
All right.

00:23:17.420 --> 00:23:19.250 align:middle line:84%
Because we know
that time follows

00:23:19.250 --> 00:23:21.570 align:middle line:90%
what we call the arrow of time.

00:23:21.570 --> 00:23:22.370 align:middle line:90%
All right.

00:23:22.370 --> 00:23:25.700 align:middle line:84%
As that river is
flowing, if we were

00:23:25.700 --> 00:23:29.990 align:middle line:84%
to put a post in the
center of the river,

00:23:29.990 --> 00:23:35.480 align:middle line:84%
that post would represent a
significant emotional event

00:23:35.480 --> 00:23:38.330 align:middle line:84%
that will happen in our
lives in the future.

00:23:38.330 --> 00:23:39.350 align:middle line:90%
It could be a marriage.

00:23:39.350 --> 00:23:40.280 align:middle line:90%
It could be a divorce.

00:23:40.280 --> 00:23:42.590 align:middle line:84%
It could be a loss
of a loved one.

00:23:42.590 --> 00:23:47.660 align:middle line:84%
It could be an ecstatic,
joyous experience.

00:23:47.660 --> 00:23:52.500 align:middle line:84%
The key here is that it is
emotionally significant for us.

00:23:52.500 --> 00:23:56.540 align:middle line:84%
So if you think of the post
in the river representing

00:23:56.540 --> 00:23:59.360 align:middle line:84%
an emotionally
significant experience.

00:23:59.360 --> 00:24:02.930 align:middle line:84%
Now, you know that if
the river is flowing,

00:24:02.930 --> 00:24:05.630 align:middle line:84%
and when the flow
hits that post,

00:24:05.630 --> 00:24:09.470 align:middle line:84%
it will create ripples
around the post.

00:24:09.470 --> 00:24:11.660 align:middle line:84%
And here's where this
gets really interesting.

00:24:11.660 --> 00:24:15.230 align:middle line:84%
Some of those
ripples actually will

00:24:15.230 --> 00:24:22.440 align:middle line:84%
occur upstream before the
post is reached by the water.

00:24:22.440 --> 00:24:23.240 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:24:23.240 --> 00:24:25.050 align:middle line:90%
So you have the post.

00:24:25.050 --> 00:24:26.906 align:middle line:10%
The water is flowing,
creating the ripples,

00:24:26.906 --> 00:24:28.530 align:middle line:10%
but the ripples don't
stop at the post.

00:24:28.530 --> 00:24:32.960 align:middle line:10%
Some of those ripples
actually precede the posts.

00:24:32.960 --> 00:24:36.830 align:middle line:10%
Scientists believe this is the
way the program of time works.

00:24:36.830 --> 00:24:40.040 align:middle line:84%
Emotionally significant
events in our lives

00:24:40.040 --> 00:24:41.900 align:middle line:84%
are like the posts
in that river.

00:24:41.900 --> 00:24:46.430 align:middle line:84%
They create ripples that
move backward in space-time

00:24:46.430 --> 00:24:49.010 align:middle line:84%
and precede the event before
it ever even happened,

00:24:49.010 --> 00:24:53.060 align:middle line:84%
sometimes by moments, sometimes
by days, sometimes by weeks.

00:24:53.060 --> 00:24:55.310 align:middle line:84%
Now, where this gets
especially interesting

00:24:55.310 --> 00:24:58.700 align:middle line:84%
is, as you've seen in
previous episodes in "Missing

00:24:58.700 --> 00:25:00.360 align:middle line:90%
Links," the human body.

00:25:00.360 --> 00:25:04.370 align:middle line:84%
In 1991, science discovered
40,000 specialized cells

00:25:04.370 --> 00:25:08.720 align:middle line:84%
in the human heart that are
called sensory neurites.

00:25:08.720 --> 00:25:09.849 align:middle line:90%
The term says it all.

00:25:09.849 --> 00:25:11.390 align:middle line:84%
They're essentially
brain-like cells,

00:25:11.390 --> 00:25:12.260 align:middle line:90%
but they're not in the brain.

00:25:12.260 --> 00:25:13.400 align:middle line:90%
They're in the heart.

00:25:13.400 --> 00:25:17.330 align:middle line:84%
These sensory neurites
have the sensitivity

00:25:17.330 --> 00:25:20.660 align:middle line:84%
to pick up information
from the field.

00:25:20.660 --> 00:25:23.300 align:middle line:84%
And it is now
believed that it is

00:25:23.300 --> 00:25:26.720 align:middle line:84%
in our heart, those sensory
neurites that are picking up

00:25:26.720 --> 00:25:28.490 align:middle line:90%
the ripples of the events--

00:25:28.490 --> 00:25:33.440 align:middle line:84%
significant events in your life
and my life globally, locally.

00:25:33.440 --> 00:25:38.945 align:middle line:84%
And if we have the
sensitivity to acknowledge

00:25:38.945 --> 00:25:40.910 align:middle line:84%
and the willingness
to acknowledge

00:25:40.910 --> 00:25:42.800 align:middle line:84%
what it is our heart
is saying to us,

00:25:42.800 --> 00:25:47.510 align:middle line:84%
it's not surprising that we
can often pick up these ripples

00:25:47.510 --> 00:25:49.070 align:middle line:84%
and have a feeling
about the events

00:25:49.070 --> 00:25:50.780 align:middle line:90%
before the events ever happened.

00:25:50.780 --> 00:25:54.710 align:middle line:84%
We saw this on a mass scale
for September 11, 2001.

00:25:54.710 --> 00:25:56.507 align:middle line:84%
There are countless
reports of people

00:25:56.507 --> 00:25:58.340 align:middle line:84%
that changed their
plans, didn't go to work,

00:25:58.340 --> 00:26:00.980 align:middle line:84%
changed airplane flights
just because they

00:26:00.980 --> 00:26:03.110 align:middle line:84%
had a feeling that it
wasn't the best thing to do.

00:26:03.110 --> 00:26:05.030 align:middle line:84%
They had a sense that
something was up,

00:26:05.030 --> 00:26:06.640 align:middle line:90%
something was going to happen.

00:26:06.640 --> 00:26:09.272 align:middle line:84%
And I'll talk about
this in a later episode.

00:26:09.272 --> 00:26:10.730 align:middle line:84%
So I wanted to
share this with you.

00:26:10.730 --> 00:26:14.560 align:middle line:84%
And with these ideas in
mind, our exploration of time

00:26:14.560 --> 00:26:18.010 align:middle line:84%
is now taking on a whole new
meaning, both in the world

00:26:18.010 --> 00:26:23.470 align:middle line:84%
as well as in our personal
lives and our relationships.

00:26:23.470 --> 00:26:25.090 align:middle line:84%
Whether the cycles
are playing out

00:26:25.090 --> 00:26:27.310 align:middle line:84%
on the smaller scale
at a personal level

00:26:27.310 --> 00:26:30.250 align:middle line:84%
or the large scale
on a global level,

00:26:30.250 --> 00:26:33.520 align:middle line:84%
our lives are unfolding within
the container of the Divine

00:26:33.520 --> 00:26:35.340 align:middle line:90%
Matrix.

00:26:35.340 --> 00:26:39.960 align:middle line:84%
In the next episode, we'll
explore the 3,000-year-old map

00:26:39.960 --> 00:26:43.710 align:middle line:84%
of time that holds the key
to where the cycles lead

00:26:43.710 --> 00:26:47.089 align:middle line:84%
and the secret to our personal
as well as our global destiny.

00:26:47.089 --> 00:26:49.380 align:middle line:84%
I want to thank you for
joining me for today's program.
