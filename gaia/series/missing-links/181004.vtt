00:00:09.927 --> 00:00:13.430 align:middle line:90%
[THEME MUSIC]

00:00:27.361 --> 00:00:29.696 align:middle line:10%
>>GREGG BRADEN: In
1944, the architect

00:00:29.696 --> 00:00:32.491 align:middle line:10%
of quantum theory,
Max Planck, he

00:00:32.491 --> 00:00:34.493 align:middle line:10%
made a statement
that reverberated

00:00:34.493 --> 00:00:37.371 align:middle line:10%
throughout the scientific
community like a shockwave

00:00:37.371 --> 00:00:39.539 align:middle line:10%
of a huge earthquake.

00:00:39.539 --> 00:00:41.792 align:middle line:84%
While he was speaking at
a conference in Florence,

00:00:41.792 --> 00:00:46.755 align:middle line:84%
Italy, Planck stated,
there is no matter as such.

00:00:46.755 --> 00:00:50.217 align:middle line:84%
All matter, he said,
originates and exists only

00:00:50.217 --> 00:00:52.344 align:middle line:90%
by virtue of a force.

00:00:52.344 --> 00:00:57.349 align:middle line:84%
We must assume behind this force
the existence of a conscious

00:00:57.349 --> 00:00:58.934 align:middle line:90%
and an intelligent mind.

00:00:58.934 --> 00:01:03.188 align:middle line:84%
This mind, he said, is
the matrix of all matter.

00:01:03.188 --> 00:01:05.440 align:middle line:84%
Well, now we know
Planck was right.

00:01:05.440 --> 00:01:06.775 align:middle line:90%
There is a field of energy.

00:01:06.775 --> 00:01:07.567 align:middle line:90%
It's universal.

00:01:07.567 --> 00:01:09.861 align:middle line:90%
It's everywhere all of the time.

00:01:09.861 --> 00:01:11.655 align:middle line:84%
And it influences
everything that

00:01:11.655 --> 00:01:16.076 align:middle line:84%
happens in the world around us,
as well as the world within us.

00:01:16.076 --> 00:01:19.037 align:middle line:84%
But the new evidence now
goes beyond simply telling us

00:01:19.037 --> 00:01:20.956 align:middle line:90%
that this matrix exists.

00:01:20.956 --> 00:01:23.250 align:middle line:84%
The experiments are
revealing the rules

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:25.961 align:middle line:84%
that govern Planck's
matrix, also now known

00:01:25.961 --> 00:01:28.213 align:middle line:84%
as The Divine Matrix
and how we can

00:01:28.213 --> 00:01:30.090 align:middle line:90%
apply those rules in our lives.

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:33.093 align:middle line:84%
And that is what this
series is all about.

00:01:33.093 --> 00:01:34.803 align:middle line:10%
My name is Gregg
Braden, and I'd like

00:01:34.803 --> 00:01:39.140 align:middle line:10%
to welcome you to The Divine
Matrix, bridging time, space,

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:40.851 align:middle line:10%
miracles, and belief.

00:01:40.851 --> 00:01:43.103 align:middle line:84%
I am your host for
this entire series.

00:01:43.103 --> 00:01:45.271 align:middle line:84%
And I am absolutely
thrilled to bring you

00:01:45.271 --> 00:01:48.358 align:middle line:84%
the discoveries, as well as
the controversy surrounding

00:01:48.358 --> 00:01:49.526 align:middle line:90%
these discoveries.

00:01:49.526 --> 00:01:51.445 align:middle line:84%
So let's begin
with the beginning.

00:01:51.445 --> 00:01:52.988 align:middle line:90%
Just what is The Divine Matrix?

00:01:56.533 --> 00:01:59.369 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes the best way to
describe the discovery and what

00:01:59.369 --> 00:02:03.707 align:middle line:84%
it means is through a real life
example from the real world.

00:02:03.707 --> 00:02:07.669 align:middle line:10%
Between 1978 and
1995, a small group

00:02:07.669 --> 00:02:10.422 align:middle line:10%
of scientists working
in a makeshift lab

00:02:10.422 --> 00:02:13.133 align:middle line:10%
tucked away on a
US military base,

00:02:13.133 --> 00:02:15.010 align:middle line:10%
they accomplished
something that was believed

00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:17.054 align:middle line:10%
to be impossible at the time.

00:02:17.054 --> 00:02:18.847 align:middle line:84%
From their small,
leaky laboratory

00:02:18.847 --> 00:02:22.476 align:middle line:84%
at Fort Meade, Maryland,
using simple techniques,

00:02:22.476 --> 00:02:25.020 align:middle line:84%
the researchers were
exploring a sophisticated

00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:27.230 align:middle line:90%
and a mysterious new frontier.

00:02:27.230 --> 00:02:29.107 align:middle line:84%
But their frontier
wasn't located

00:02:29.107 --> 00:02:30.817 align:middle line:84%
at the edges of the
galaxy or hidden deep

00:02:30.817 --> 00:02:32.694 align:middle line:90%
inside the quantum atom.

00:02:32.694 --> 00:02:36.490 align:middle line:84%
The realm they were exploring
was an inner frontier,

00:02:36.490 --> 00:02:39.826 align:middle line:84%
an advanced state of
consciousness that had a "Star

00:02:39.826 --> 00:02:42.788 align:middle line:84%
Trek"-like potential for
gathering information during

00:02:42.788 --> 00:02:44.456 align:middle line:90%
the Cold War years.

00:02:44.456 --> 00:02:47.751 align:middle line:84%
If someone had casually
walked into the room

00:02:47.751 --> 00:02:49.836 align:middle line:84%
while one of the
experiments was happening,

00:02:49.836 --> 00:02:51.421 align:middle line:84%
they could have
easily mistaken what

00:02:51.421 --> 00:02:54.800 align:middle line:84%
they saw for a lunchtime
relaxation class.

00:02:54.800 --> 00:02:58.553 align:middle line:84%
But in truth, nothing could've
been further from the truth.

00:02:58.553 --> 00:03:01.139 align:middle line:84%
The researchers, who were
sitting quietly, their eyes

00:03:01.139 --> 00:03:05.185 align:middle line:84%
closed, were learning
to access and sustain

00:03:05.185 --> 00:03:07.354 align:middle line:84%
a mysterious state
of consciousness

00:03:07.354 --> 00:03:10.023 align:middle line:84%
that you and I typically
pass through every night

00:03:10.023 --> 00:03:11.942 align:middle line:90%
as we drift into a deep sleep.

00:03:11.942 --> 00:03:13.318 align:middle line:84%
The bottom line
is that they were

00:03:13.318 --> 00:03:14.945 align:middle line:90%
trying to achieve three things.

00:03:14.945 --> 00:03:17.072 align:middle line:84%
The first thing they
were trying to do

00:03:17.072 --> 00:03:21.451 align:middle line:84%
was, on demand, access
a state of consciousness

00:03:21.451 --> 00:03:24.538 align:middle line:84%
without slipping
into a deeper sleep.

00:03:24.538 --> 00:03:27.374 align:middle line:84%
Number two, once they
were in this state,

00:03:27.374 --> 00:03:28.792 align:middle line:90%
they wanted to stay there.

00:03:28.792 --> 00:03:31.628 align:middle line:84%
They wanted to stay
suspended, conscious

00:03:31.628 --> 00:03:36.341 align:middle line:84%
and actively awake and able
to function from this place.

00:03:36.341 --> 00:03:39.594 align:middle line:84%
And number three, they
wanted to discover

00:03:39.594 --> 00:03:42.930 align:middle line:84%
how the state of
consciousness can actually

00:03:42.930 --> 00:03:48.311 align:middle line:84%
be a conduit to other locations
in the physical world,

00:03:48.311 --> 00:03:52.691 align:middle line:84%
remote locations that they could
actually see and hear and smell

00:03:52.691 --> 00:03:56.570 align:middle line:84%
and even touch without
ever leaving a laboratory.

00:03:56.570 --> 00:03:58.196 align:middle line:84%
Well, the technique
they were exploring

00:03:58.196 --> 00:03:59.906 align:middle line:90%
is called remote viewing.

00:03:59.906 --> 00:04:01.533 align:middle line:84%
And the name given
to the project

00:04:01.533 --> 00:04:04.077 align:middle line:84%
at the time, that
tells the whole story.

00:04:04.077 --> 00:04:06.496 align:middle line:90%
It was called Project Stargate.

00:04:06.496 --> 00:04:09.749 align:middle line:10%
And it was a military attempt
to explore the deepest

00:04:09.749 --> 00:04:13.253 align:middle line:10%
realms of human potential
for military applications

00:04:13.253 --> 00:04:15.547 align:middle line:10%
during the Cold War years.

00:04:15.547 --> 00:04:18.550 align:middle line:84%
The idea was simply this,
that valuable and potentially

00:04:18.550 --> 00:04:21.511 align:middle line:84%
life-saving information
could be gathered

00:04:21.511 --> 00:04:25.891 align:middle line:84%
from the field around us
without risking the lives of men

00:04:25.891 --> 00:04:29.019 align:middle line:84%
and women with boots
physically on the ground going

00:04:29.019 --> 00:04:31.146 align:middle line:90%
to these remote locations.

00:04:31.146 --> 00:04:33.523 align:middle line:84%
The key here is
that the projects

00:04:33.523 --> 00:04:35.525 align:middle line:84%
at Fort Meade, and
remote viewing sessions,

00:04:35.525 --> 00:04:39.112 align:middle line:84%
in general, these things
can only be possible

00:04:39.112 --> 00:04:41.490 align:middle line:90%
because the matrix exists.

00:04:41.490 --> 00:04:44.409 align:middle line:10%
It provides something for the
consciousness of the viewer

00:04:44.409 --> 00:04:46.161 align:middle line:10%
to travel through.

00:04:46.161 --> 00:04:50.207 align:middle line:84%
Well, Project Stargate
officially ended in 1995,

00:04:50.207 --> 00:04:52.501 align:middle line:84%
and it's recently
been declassified.

00:04:52.501 --> 00:04:54.586 align:middle line:84%
So we now have
access to the results

00:04:54.586 --> 00:04:58.173 align:middle line:84%
that were produced during those
early sessions at Fort Meade.

00:04:58.173 --> 00:05:00.467 align:middle line:84%
And I'd like to use
some of those results,

00:05:00.467 --> 00:05:04.179 align:middle line:84%
as well as others to give
you just an example of how

00:05:04.179 --> 00:05:07.766 align:middle line:84%
real this matrix is and
how deeply it underlies

00:05:07.766 --> 00:05:10.519 align:middle line:90%
our physical reality.

00:05:10.519 --> 00:05:12.312 align:middle line:84%
In a typical remote
viewing session,

00:05:12.312 --> 00:05:14.648 align:middle line:84%
there are two people
that are involved.

00:05:14.648 --> 00:05:15.815 align:middle line:90%
One is the viewer.

00:05:15.815 --> 00:05:17.651 align:middle line:84%
And this is the one
whose consciousness

00:05:17.651 --> 00:05:19.402 align:middle line:90%
is actually traveling.

00:05:19.402 --> 00:05:21.571 align:middle line:84%
And the second is
called the monitor.

00:05:21.571 --> 00:05:23.448 align:middle line:84%
And the role of the
monitor is simple.

00:05:23.448 --> 00:05:26.618 align:middle line:84%
The role of the monitor
is to guide the viewer

00:05:26.618 --> 00:05:29.120 align:middle line:84%
into a specific state
of consciousness,

00:05:29.120 --> 00:05:32.916 align:middle line:84%
and then to help the viewer
stay in that state using

00:05:32.916 --> 00:05:37.796 align:middle line:84%
predetermined protocols, and
to communicate from that state

00:05:37.796 --> 00:05:40.549 align:middle line:84%
without dropping
into a deeper sleep.

00:05:40.549 --> 00:05:42.801 align:middle line:84%
The monitor guides
the viewer, step

00:05:42.801 --> 00:05:47.389 align:middle line:84%
by step, to help them focus on
things like a precise location

00:05:47.389 --> 00:05:51.058 align:middle line:84%
or an object that can be
either in another room,

00:05:51.058 --> 00:05:53.061 align:middle line:84%
could be another
city, or it can be

00:05:53.061 --> 00:05:55.897 align:middle line:84%
on a battlefield on the
other side of the planet.

00:05:55.897 --> 00:05:57.482 align:middle line:84%
Here's an example
of what I mean.

00:05:57.482 --> 00:06:01.069 align:middle line:10%
The viewers are typically
given a target of some kind.

00:06:01.069 --> 00:06:02.445 align:middle line:90%
It can be a building.

00:06:02.445 --> 00:06:03.738 align:middle line:90%
It can be a location.

00:06:03.738 --> 00:06:04.948 align:middle line:90%
It can be a geographic area.

00:06:04.948 --> 00:06:06.575 align:middle line:90%
It can be a person.

00:06:06.575 --> 00:06:08.451 align:middle line:84%
They are given
physical coordinates.

00:06:08.451 --> 00:06:10.120 align:middle line:90%
It can be a street address.

00:06:10.120 --> 00:06:12.664 align:middle line:84%
It can be a latitude
and a longitude.

00:06:12.664 --> 00:06:16.001 align:middle line:84%
And the viewers receive
subtle sensations

00:06:16.001 --> 00:06:18.211 align:middle line:84%
while they're in
this altered state.

00:06:18.211 --> 00:06:20.380 align:middle line:84%
And one of the things
that the researchers found

00:06:20.380 --> 00:06:25.510 align:middle line:84%
during these early experiments
is that the sensations are not

00:06:25.510 --> 00:06:28.513 align:middle line:84%
the most present,
the most visible,

00:06:28.513 --> 00:06:30.682 align:middle line:84%
the brightest,
the most profound,

00:06:30.682 --> 00:06:33.685 align:middle line:84%
but often the very,
very subtle sensations.

00:06:33.685 --> 00:06:37.272 align:middle line:84%
And they have to be trained to
recognize and be able to detect

00:06:37.272 --> 00:06:39.357 align:middle line:90%
these very subtle sensations.

00:06:39.357 --> 00:06:42.360 align:middle line:84%
And they begin to sketch
on a piece of paper what

00:06:42.360 --> 00:06:46.948 align:middle line:84%
it is that they see, as well
as other sensations of smell

00:06:46.948 --> 00:06:52.412 align:middle line:84%
or if they feel touch or
they hear specific sounds.

00:06:52.412 --> 00:06:54.539 align:middle line:10%
The image that you're
seeing on the screen

00:06:54.539 --> 00:06:58.460 align:middle line:10%
is an example from one
of these early sessions.

00:06:58.460 --> 00:07:01.004 align:middle line:84%
The viewer was
given coordinates,

00:07:01.004 --> 00:07:04.591 align:middle line:84%
latitude and longitude, of a
place somewhere on the earth.

00:07:04.591 --> 00:07:07.260 align:middle line:84%
They had no idea
where this place was.

00:07:07.260 --> 00:07:09.471 align:middle line:10%
And from the altered
state, the viewer

00:07:09.471 --> 00:07:11.598 align:middle line:10%
began to sketch
what you're seeing.

00:07:11.598 --> 00:07:14.601 align:middle line:10%
And what you're seeing in
the upper right-hand corner

00:07:14.601 --> 00:07:16.186 align:middle line:10%
is a body of water.

00:07:16.186 --> 00:07:20.023 align:middle line:10%
The viewer felt that this was
an ocean, and that was noted.

00:07:20.023 --> 00:07:25.278 align:middle line:10%
You're seeing the
longitudinal runway or highway

00:07:25.278 --> 00:07:27.364 align:middle line:10%
that was drawn-- it's very
obvious-- in the center

00:07:27.364 --> 00:07:28.156 align:middle line:10%
of the image.

00:07:28.156 --> 00:07:32.202 align:middle line:84%
And then just to the left
and to the upper-left,

00:07:32.202 --> 00:07:34.996 align:middle line:84%
they saw what they perceived
as some kind of buildings

00:07:34.996 --> 00:07:36.331 align:middle line:90%
that were there.

00:07:36.331 --> 00:07:42.128 align:middle line:84%
So the viewer is sketching
only what he or she perceives

00:07:42.128 --> 00:07:45.048 align:middle line:84%
in this subtle state
without imposing

00:07:45.048 --> 00:07:47.342 align:middle line:84%
their ideas and
their viewpoints,

00:07:47.342 --> 00:07:49.594 align:middle line:84%
their filters of what
should or should not be.

00:07:49.594 --> 00:07:51.429 align:middle line:84%
And this is what
takes the training.

00:07:51.429 --> 00:07:54.265 align:middle line:10%
Well, the next image that
you're seeing on the screen

00:07:54.265 --> 00:07:57.310 align:middle line:10%
is an actual photograph
of the location

00:07:57.310 --> 00:08:01.606 align:middle line:10%
that the viewer picked up in
the remote sensing session.

00:08:01.606 --> 00:08:04.067 align:middle line:10%
This is a military target.

00:08:04.067 --> 00:08:06.611 align:middle line:84%
And what you see
in the photograph

00:08:06.611 --> 00:08:10.532 align:middle line:84%
is there is an ocean in the
upper part of the image.

00:08:10.532 --> 00:08:12.534 align:middle line:90%
There is actually a runway.

00:08:12.534 --> 00:08:15.787 align:middle line:10%
And so the viewer was right
on, right on this target.

00:08:15.787 --> 00:08:19.040 align:middle line:10%
There's a runway that is running
through the center of the image

00:08:19.040 --> 00:08:20.125 align:middle line:10%
and to the left.

00:08:20.125 --> 00:08:23.044 align:middle line:10%
We begin seeing the
structures and the buildings.

00:08:23.044 --> 00:08:26.089 align:middle line:84%
So what happens in these
sessions is sometimes

00:08:26.089 --> 00:08:28.758 align:middle line:84%
a remote viewer can pick
up things that may not

00:08:28.758 --> 00:08:30.760 align:middle line:90%
be visible in the photographs.

00:08:30.760 --> 00:08:32.511 align:middle line:84%
And sometimes the
photographs have

00:08:32.511 --> 00:08:35.472 align:middle line:84%
things that may not be
visible to the remote viewer.

00:08:35.472 --> 00:08:39.102 align:middle line:84%
When we put these together,
they give us the opportunity

00:08:39.102 --> 00:08:43.440 align:middle line:84%
to gather information without
ever having a person physically

00:08:43.440 --> 00:08:45.400 align:middle line:90%
go to gather that information.

00:08:45.400 --> 00:08:46.776 align:middle line:90%
Let me give you another example.

00:08:46.776 --> 00:08:48.403 align:middle line:10%
And I find this one
really fascinating

00:08:48.403 --> 00:08:51.364 align:middle line:10%
because of the specificity here.

00:08:51.364 --> 00:08:54.284 align:middle line:84%
The remote viewer
was given a location.

00:08:54.284 --> 00:08:59.205 align:middle line:84%
And in that location, the
viewer began to detect,

00:08:59.205 --> 00:09:01.124 align:middle line:90%
very, very clearly, a structure.

00:09:01.124 --> 00:09:03.585 align:middle line:84%
And you're seeing that
structure on the screen.

00:09:03.585 --> 00:09:05.503 align:middle line:84%
He didn't know what
the structure was,

00:09:05.503 --> 00:09:07.964 align:middle line:84%
but the wheels
were very obvious.

00:09:07.964 --> 00:09:10.759 align:middle line:84%
And the form of the
structure was very obvious.

00:09:10.759 --> 00:09:14.262 align:middle line:84%
And the viewer was trained to
record without projecting his

00:09:14.262 --> 00:09:17.432 align:middle line:84%
or her impressions-- in
this case, it was a male--

00:09:17.432 --> 00:09:19.392 align:middle line:90%
what it is that they saw.

00:09:19.392 --> 00:09:22.061 align:middle line:84%
Well, the next image that
you're seeing on the screen

00:09:22.061 --> 00:09:23.188 align:middle line:90%
is what was actually there.

00:09:23.188 --> 00:09:25.398 align:middle line:90%
This is an industrial crane.

00:09:25.398 --> 00:09:27.192 align:middle line:84%
And you can see-- look
at the similarities.

00:09:27.192 --> 00:09:30.570 align:middle line:84%
There are two wheels
at each corner,

00:09:30.570 --> 00:09:32.113 align:middle line:84%
and the viewer
got that right on.

00:09:32.113 --> 00:09:34.991 align:middle line:84%
Look at the
structure and the way

00:09:34.991 --> 00:09:37.118 align:middle line:84%
that this is moving
along a track.

00:09:37.118 --> 00:09:40.997 align:middle line:10%
The photographs now show us that
this was an industrial crane

00:09:40.997 --> 00:09:44.834 align:middle line:10%
from a military industrial
complex, a very specific crane

00:09:44.834 --> 00:09:48.171 align:middle line:10%
used only to move very
specific kinds of material.

00:09:48.171 --> 00:09:52.133 align:middle line:10%
So this gives the
military analyst insight

00:09:52.133 --> 00:09:54.803 align:middle line:10%
into what's happening
at this location in ways

00:09:54.803 --> 00:09:57.931 align:middle line:10%
that they could only have
if someone were physically

00:09:57.931 --> 00:09:59.516 align:middle line:10%
there watching this.

00:09:59.516 --> 00:10:04.437 align:middle line:84%
So I'm sharing these two
images for a purpose.

00:10:04.437 --> 00:10:07.315 align:middle line:84%
The images begin as
general descriptions.

00:10:07.315 --> 00:10:11.569 align:middle line:84%
And the specifics can then
be identified and honed into.

00:10:11.569 --> 00:10:15.323 align:middle line:84%
So for example, on the
crane, the researchers

00:10:15.323 --> 00:10:19.077 align:middle line:84%
could have asked for the viewer
to spend more time and more

00:10:19.077 --> 00:10:21.746 align:middle line:84%
detail and go deeper into
what that crane was all about

00:10:21.746 --> 00:10:24.040 align:middle line:90%
and how it was being used.

00:10:24.040 --> 00:10:28.545 align:middle line:84%
So at its peak, the original
remote viewing project,

00:10:28.545 --> 00:10:32.966 align:middle line:84%
it employed 22 people,
cost about $20 million.

00:10:32.966 --> 00:10:36.511 align:middle line:84%
And it was used on
more than 450 missions.

00:10:36.511 --> 00:10:38.429 align:middle line:10%
The project was so successful.

00:10:38.429 --> 00:10:41.641 align:middle line:10%
It located American
hostages in Iran.

00:10:41.641 --> 00:10:45.395 align:middle line:84%
It successfully pinpointed scud
missiles during the Gulf War

00:10:45.395 --> 00:10:48.356 align:middle line:84%
without ever sending men
and women into the desert,

00:10:48.356 --> 00:10:51.401 align:middle line:84%
risking their lives physically
to find those missiles.

00:10:51.401 --> 00:10:55.655 align:middle line:84%
It even located the plutonium
in North Korea in 1994

00:10:55.655 --> 00:10:58.157 align:middle line:84%
when there was a question
as to where North Korea was

00:10:58.157 --> 00:11:00.201 align:middle line:90%
in their nuclear program.

00:11:00.201 --> 00:11:02.453 align:middle line:84%
The success of the remote
viewing experiments

00:11:02.453 --> 00:11:04.122 align:middle line:90%
poses a key question.

00:11:04.122 --> 00:11:06.958 align:middle line:84%
And the question
is this, what is

00:11:06.958 --> 00:11:11.045 align:middle line:84%
the stuff the viewer's
consciousness is traveling

00:11:11.045 --> 00:11:13.882 align:middle line:84%
through that allows the
viewer to see countries

00:11:13.882 --> 00:11:16.342 align:middle line:84%
in secret locations on the
other side of the planet?

00:11:16.342 --> 00:11:18.553 align:middle line:84%
In a nutshell, the
question is this.

00:11:18.553 --> 00:11:21.306 align:middle line:84%
It all boils down
to what is in what

00:11:21.306 --> 00:11:23.933 align:middle line:84%
we call the empty
space of the universe.

00:11:23.933 --> 00:11:26.686 align:middle line:84%
What is in the space
of the nothing?

00:11:26.686 --> 00:11:28.229 align:middle line:84%
Well, to answer
this question, we've

00:11:28.229 --> 00:11:29.814 align:middle line:84%
opened the door to
one of the greatest

00:11:29.814 --> 00:11:32.275 align:middle line:84%
mysteries of our
existence, a mystery

00:11:32.275 --> 00:11:35.737 align:middle line:84%
that our ancestors describe
in the language of their time,

00:11:35.737 --> 00:11:38.114 align:middle line:84%
and that modern science
is just beginning

00:11:38.114 --> 00:11:40.867 align:middle line:90%
to understand in ours.

00:11:40.867 --> 00:11:44.329 align:middle line:84%
Almost universally, ancient
texts and Indigenous traditions

00:11:44.329 --> 00:11:48.165 align:middle line:84%
describe a field of energy
that connects all things.

00:11:48.165 --> 00:11:52.003 align:middle line:84%
I want to give you some examples
for how those descriptions have

00:11:52.003 --> 00:11:53.796 align:middle line:84%
been created in the
past so that you

00:11:53.796 --> 00:11:57.634 align:middle line:84%
can see the parallels to
what we now know exist today.

00:11:57.634 --> 00:12:01.429 align:middle line:84%
Chief Seattle, a 19th century
elder of the Suquamish people,

00:12:01.429 --> 00:12:03.056 align:middle line:84%
he described this
mystery, and I'm

00:12:03.056 --> 00:12:05.141 align:middle line:90%
going to read this specifically.

00:12:05.141 --> 00:12:07.936 align:middle line:84%
He said, "All things
are connected.

00:12:07.936 --> 00:12:11.731 align:middle line:84%
Man did not weave
the web of life.

00:12:11.731 --> 00:12:13.566 align:middle line:90%
He's merely a strand in it.

00:12:13.566 --> 00:12:17.820 align:middle line:84%
And whatever he does to the
web, he does to himself."

00:12:17.820 --> 00:12:20.615 align:middle line:84%
In the processes of
the ancient Hopi,

00:12:20.615 --> 00:12:24.452 align:middle line:84%
there are descriptions of
a web, or a net as well.

00:12:24.452 --> 00:12:26.704 align:middle line:10%
And this comes from
the Hopi prophecy

00:12:26.704 --> 00:12:30.875 align:middle line:10%
of what happened after the
first world of the Hopi

00:12:30.875 --> 00:12:32.627 align:middle line:10%
was threatened.

00:12:32.627 --> 00:12:35.713 align:middle line:10%
Spider Grandmother emerged
after the destruction

00:12:35.713 --> 00:12:37.006 align:middle line:10%
of the first world.

00:12:37.006 --> 00:12:39.300 align:middle line:10%
She emerged into
the Second World.

00:12:39.300 --> 00:12:41.511 align:middle line:10%
And the first thing
that she did was

00:12:41.511 --> 00:12:44.806 align:middle line:10%
she wove the web of
creation, upon which

00:12:44.806 --> 00:12:47.016 align:middle line:10%
her children and
her grandchildren

00:12:47.016 --> 00:12:50.645 align:middle line:10%
and all things in the
universe could exist.

00:12:50.645 --> 00:12:53.856 align:middle line:84%
Now I want to share with you
the exact words from the Hopi

00:12:53.856 --> 00:12:57.610 align:middle line:84%
prophecy describing
how this happened.

00:12:57.610 --> 00:13:00.738 align:middle line:10%
This is a quote, "When
the universe was still

00:13:00.738 --> 00:13:05.034 align:middle line:10%
so dark that not even shadows
could be seen in the night,

00:13:05.034 --> 00:13:09.372 align:middle line:10%
Spider Grandmother began to
sing her weaving song while she

00:13:09.372 --> 00:13:11.541 align:middle line:10%
danced across the sky.

00:13:11.541 --> 00:13:14.794 align:middle line:10%
As she spun her
thread, the Sky World

00:13:14.794 --> 00:13:18.673 align:middle line:10%
filled with light and
life as the stars, suns,

00:13:18.673 --> 00:13:22.176 align:middle line:10%
and the planets prepared to
give birth to their children."

00:13:22.176 --> 00:13:23.845 align:middle line:84%
Well, you can see
from this description,

00:13:23.845 --> 00:13:25.805 align:middle line:90%
it certainly is not scientific.

00:13:25.805 --> 00:13:29.058 align:middle line:10%
But it is telling us that
this universal essence,

00:13:29.058 --> 00:13:32.520 align:middle line:10%
this substance, what
the Hopi saw as a "web"

00:13:32.520 --> 00:13:36.149 align:middle line:10%
was what began the
beginning of the universe

00:13:36.149 --> 00:13:38.192 align:middle line:10%
as we know it today.

00:13:38.192 --> 00:13:40.111 align:middle line:90%
Well, the Hopi aren't alone.

00:13:40.111 --> 00:13:42.864 align:middle line:84%
In a similar way, the
ancient Buddhist traditions

00:13:42.864 --> 00:13:48.494 align:middle line:84%
describe how the great god Indra
created the web of creation.

00:13:48.494 --> 00:13:51.998 align:middle line:84%
"Far away in the heavenly
abode of the great god Indra,"

00:13:51.998 --> 00:13:54.625 align:middle line:84%
the texts say, "there
is a wonderful net

00:13:54.625 --> 00:13:58.171 align:middle line:84%
that stretches out
infinitely in all directions.

00:13:58.171 --> 00:14:01.591 align:middle line:84%
And at the intersection
of each point on the net

00:14:01.591 --> 00:14:04.302 align:middle line:90%
is a glittering jewel of light.

00:14:04.302 --> 00:14:07.930 align:middle line:84%
And that light is a
universe unto itself."

00:14:07.930 --> 00:14:10.224 align:middle line:84%
Well, the scientific
community is

00:14:10.224 --> 00:14:12.518 align:middle line:84%
beginning to describe
a structure that

00:14:12.518 --> 00:14:16.981 align:middle line:84%
sounds very similar to the
Hopi web and to India's net.

00:14:16.981 --> 00:14:20.359 align:middle line:84%
It's a structure that
underlies our everyday reality.

00:14:20.359 --> 00:14:23.571 align:middle line:10%
And even Einstein sensed that
this structure was there,

00:14:23.571 --> 00:14:26.657 align:middle line:10%
although as a scientist,
interestingly he shared it

00:14:26.657 --> 00:14:29.368 align:middle line:10%
from a very poetic description.

00:14:29.368 --> 00:14:31.204 align:middle line:10%
What Einstein said
to us, he said,

00:14:31.204 --> 00:14:35.040 align:middle line:10%
"Nature shows us only
the tail of the lion."

00:14:35.040 --> 00:14:38.377 align:middle line:10%
He says, "I do not doubt that
the lion belongs to the tail,

00:14:38.377 --> 00:14:41.756 align:middle line:10%
even though he cannot at once
reveal himself because of his

00:14:41.756 --> 00:14:43.716 align:middle line:10%
enormous size."

00:14:43.716 --> 00:14:46.511 align:middle line:10%
So what Einstein was saying,
from his perspective,

00:14:46.511 --> 00:14:48.304 align:middle line:10%
is there's something out there.

00:14:48.304 --> 00:14:52.725 align:middle line:84%
It's so big, but we cannot see
it from our vantage point where

00:14:52.725 --> 00:14:55.103 align:middle line:90%
we are in space and time.

00:14:55.103 --> 00:14:58.147 align:middle line:84%
And this underlying thinking
played a powerful role

00:14:58.147 --> 00:15:00.900 align:middle line:84%
as he developed his theories
of relativity and some

00:15:00.900 --> 00:15:04.195 align:middle line:84%
of the other theories
and mathematics concepts

00:15:04.195 --> 00:15:06.906 align:middle line:90%
that led to those theories.

00:15:06.906 --> 00:15:10.201 align:middle line:84%
So there's a common
theme that weaves its way

00:15:10.201 --> 00:15:12.245 align:middle line:84%
through each of
these descriptions,

00:15:12.245 --> 00:15:14.288 align:middle line:84%
through the web of
Spider Grandmother,

00:15:14.288 --> 00:15:15.998 align:middle line:84%
through the net
of the god Indra,

00:15:15.998 --> 00:15:19.502 align:middle line:84%
and through Einstein's
perspective, this idea

00:15:19.502 --> 00:15:23.589 align:middle line:84%
that there is something out
there that connects all things.

00:15:23.589 --> 00:15:25.383 align:middle line:84%
Well, in the beginning
of this program,

00:15:25.383 --> 00:15:29.470 align:middle line:84%
I shared Max Planck's statement,
his perspective of this essence

00:15:29.470 --> 00:15:30.263 align:middle line:90%
as well.

00:15:30.263 --> 00:15:32.723 align:middle line:84%
And Planck's statement
of this matrix

00:15:32.723 --> 00:15:34.851 align:middle line:84%
that underlies our
physical reality

00:15:34.851 --> 00:15:38.688 align:middle line:84%
is a perfect example of what
this thinking is all about.

00:15:38.688 --> 00:15:42.525 align:middle line:84%
So the question is,
what is this made of?

00:15:42.525 --> 00:15:45.361 align:middle line:84%
What is the web or the
net or the matrix made of?

00:15:45.361 --> 00:15:48.489 align:middle line:84%
And what are the rules that
govern this fundamental field

00:15:48.489 --> 00:15:49.282 align:middle line:90%
of energy?

00:15:49.282 --> 00:15:51.993 align:middle line:84%
And what does it mean
to us in our lives?

00:15:51.993 --> 00:15:55.705 align:middle line:84%
Well, in Season 1 of "Missing
Links," the Fifth Episode,

00:15:55.705 --> 00:15:58.332 align:middle line:84%
I described an experiment
performed in Switzerland

00:15:58.332 --> 00:16:01.752 align:middle line:84%
at the University
of Geneva in 1997.

00:16:01.752 --> 00:16:03.921 align:middle line:84%
I want to summarize the
experiment for you now.

00:16:03.921 --> 00:16:05.590 align:middle line:84%
And I'm going to do
it from a little bit

00:16:05.590 --> 00:16:07.466 align:middle line:84%
different perspective,
with a little bit

00:16:07.466 --> 00:16:11.470 align:middle line:84%
different emphasis from what
I did in that first season.

00:16:11.470 --> 00:16:13.264 align:middle line:84%
The experiment itself,
it was no secret.

00:16:13.264 --> 00:16:16.767 align:middle line:10%
It was reported over 3,400
journalists, educators,

00:16:16.767 --> 00:16:19.478 align:middle line:10%
scientists, and
engineers, in more than 40

00:16:19.478 --> 00:16:21.147 align:middle line:10%
different countries.

00:16:21.147 --> 00:16:24.483 align:middle line:10%
And the experiment
simply goes like this.

00:16:24.483 --> 00:16:28.362 align:middle line:84%
Scientists took a photon,
a particle of light.

00:16:28.362 --> 00:16:31.199 align:middle line:84%
This is the stuff the
atoms are made of.

00:16:31.199 --> 00:16:33.034 align:middle line:90%
They took a single photon.

00:16:33.034 --> 00:16:35.328 align:middle line:84%
They wanted to create
two identical photons.

00:16:35.328 --> 00:16:39.248 align:middle line:84%
So they took the one and broke
it into two separate photons

00:16:39.248 --> 00:16:42.877 align:middle line:84%
so that each one would
have identical properties.

00:16:42.877 --> 00:16:47.006 align:middle line:84%
And those two photons, they
isolated into a chamber.

00:16:47.006 --> 00:16:50.927 align:middle line:84%
And from this chamber, they
used fiber optic cables,

00:16:50.927 --> 00:16:52.678 align:middle line:90%
moving in opposite directions.

00:16:52.678 --> 00:16:57.600 align:middle line:84%
And one cable went seven miles
to a town seven miles away.

00:16:57.600 --> 00:17:00.061 align:middle line:84%
The other cable went seven
miles to another town

00:17:00.061 --> 00:17:05.316 align:middle line:84%
seven miles away from the place
where these photons began.

00:17:05.316 --> 00:17:08.861 align:middle line:84%
Each of the photons
was shot seven miles

00:17:08.861 --> 00:17:10.655 align:middle line:90%
in opposite directions.

00:17:10.655 --> 00:17:12.031 align:middle line:84%
So when they reached
their targets

00:17:12.031 --> 00:17:13.574 align:middle line:90%
they were 14 miles apart.

00:17:13.574 --> 00:17:15.409 align:middle line:84%
And this is where the
experiments actually

00:17:15.409 --> 00:17:18.621 align:middle line:84%
began, because what
the scientists found

00:17:18.621 --> 00:17:23.251 align:middle line:84%
was whatever they did to one
of the photons in one location,

00:17:23.251 --> 00:17:26.796 align:middle line:84%
in one moment in time,
the other photon acted

00:17:26.796 --> 00:17:30.716 align:middle line:84%
like it was having exactly
the same experience at exactly

00:17:30.716 --> 00:17:32.885 align:middle line:90%
the same moment in time.

00:17:32.885 --> 00:17:36.681 align:middle line:10%
They used atomic clocks to
tell them how long it took,

00:17:36.681 --> 00:17:40.184 align:middle line:10%
how much time did it take
for the information to move

00:17:40.184 --> 00:17:41.769 align:middle line:10%
from one photon to the other.

00:17:41.769 --> 00:17:44.855 align:middle line:84%
And this is where the problems
begin, because the atomic clock

00:17:44.855 --> 00:17:46.691 align:middle line:90%
said the time was zero.

00:17:46.691 --> 00:17:47.858 align:middle line:90%
There was no lag time.

00:17:47.858 --> 00:17:49.902 align:middle line:90%
It was instantaneous.

00:17:49.902 --> 00:17:52.196 align:middle line:10%
This breaks the rules
of Einstein's theory

00:17:52.196 --> 00:17:53.572 align:middle line:10%
of relativity.

00:17:53.572 --> 00:17:55.658 align:middle line:84%
Relativity says that
nothing can travel faster

00:17:55.658 --> 00:17:57.243 align:middle line:90%
than the speed of light.

00:17:57.243 --> 00:18:00.496 align:middle line:84%
For the two photons to have
exactly the same experience

00:18:00.496 --> 00:18:03.374 align:middle line:84%
at exactly the same
time with no lag time

00:18:03.374 --> 00:18:05.251 align:middle line:84%
means that somehow
the information

00:18:05.251 --> 00:18:09.672 align:middle line:84%
had to move from point A
to point B instantaneously,

00:18:09.672 --> 00:18:11.882 align:middle line:90%
faster than the speed of light.

00:18:11.882 --> 00:18:14.385 align:middle line:84%
This is where the
problems began.

00:18:14.385 --> 00:18:17.722 align:middle line:84%
So the behavior of the
photons is a problem

00:18:17.722 --> 00:18:19.890 align:middle line:90%
for conventional physics.

00:18:19.890 --> 00:18:24.687 align:middle line:84%
Those photons are defying the
laws of conventional physics.

00:18:24.687 --> 00:18:27.773 align:middle line:84%
However, they conform to
the laws of relativity.

00:18:27.773 --> 00:18:30.067 align:middle line:84%
And this is where the
experiment becomes

00:18:30.067 --> 00:18:31.986 align:middle line:84%
very relevant to
everything that we're

00:18:31.986 --> 00:18:36.449 align:middle line:84%
talking about when we talk
about this matrix of energy.

00:18:36.449 --> 00:18:40.870 align:middle line:84%
What the experiment tells us
is that particles that are once

00:18:40.870 --> 00:18:46.584 align:middle line:84%
joined physically remain
linked energetically

00:18:46.584 --> 00:18:50.254 align:middle line:84%
even though they are physically
separated from one another.

00:18:50.254 --> 00:18:53.466 align:middle line:84%
Two photons were
once a single photon.

00:18:53.466 --> 00:18:56.886 align:middle line:84%
Even though they were split
into two separate photons,

00:18:56.886 --> 00:18:59.722 align:middle line:84%
energetically, they
were connected.

00:18:59.722 --> 00:19:02.016 align:middle line:84%
The term is called
entanglement--

00:19:02.016 --> 00:19:03.684 align:middle line:90%
quantum entanglement.

00:19:03.684 --> 00:19:06.729 align:middle line:84%
And what it means is that
whatever is happening

00:19:06.729 --> 00:19:08.981 align:middle line:84%
to one of those
photons in one place,

00:19:08.981 --> 00:19:11.859 align:middle line:84%
whether it's 14 miles from the
other one on the other side

00:19:11.859 --> 00:19:13.944 align:middle line:84%
of the planet or in the
other side of the universe

00:19:13.944 --> 00:19:16.197 align:middle line:84%
is irrelevant,
they're entangled.

00:19:16.197 --> 00:19:21.369 align:middle line:84%
And they will always reflect
the exact same parameters in one

00:19:21.369 --> 00:19:23.579 align:middle line:90%
that are happening to the other.

00:19:23.579 --> 00:19:26.165 align:middle line:84%
Let me tell you why
this is so powerful, why

00:19:26.165 --> 00:19:28.209 align:middle line:90%
this is so important.

00:19:28.209 --> 00:19:32.463 align:middle line:84%
If we think about the
model of creation,

00:19:32.463 --> 00:19:34.882 align:middle line:84%
if we think about our
universe, scientists

00:19:34.882 --> 00:19:39.428 align:middle line:84%
tell us that the universe began
with a tremendous release,

00:19:39.428 --> 00:19:42.932 align:middle line:84%
a primal release of energy
that we call the Big Bang.

00:19:42.932 --> 00:19:45.142 align:middle line:84%
In the Big Bang,
energy was released,

00:19:45.142 --> 00:19:47.144 align:middle line:90%
and it began to expand.

00:19:47.144 --> 00:19:50.398 align:middle line:84%
And physical matter began
to expand and move away

00:19:50.398 --> 00:19:54.610 align:middle line:84%
from the point of the
release of the energy.

00:19:54.610 --> 00:19:58.239 align:middle line:84%
If we could reverse
the Big Bang,

00:19:58.239 --> 00:20:00.366 align:middle line:84%
if we could take
that physical matter

00:20:00.366 --> 00:20:04.161 align:middle line:84%
and bring it all back to the
point where it all began,

00:20:04.161 --> 00:20:07.540 align:middle line:84%
what scientists tell us
is, at that moment just

00:20:07.540 --> 00:20:10.751 align:middle line:84%
after the release of energy,
all the matter in the universe,

00:20:10.751 --> 00:20:13.546 align:middle line:84%
as big as the universe
appears, all that matter

00:20:13.546 --> 00:20:19.677 align:middle line:84%
would fit into the space about
the size of a single green pea,

00:20:19.677 --> 00:20:23.180 align:middle line:84%
that all the physical matter
from all of the bodies, all

00:20:23.180 --> 00:20:27.059 align:middle line:84%
of the planets, all the stars,
all of that physical matter

00:20:27.059 --> 00:20:29.520 align:middle line:84%
which is believed to
take up only about 4%

00:20:29.520 --> 00:20:30.938 align:middle line:84%
of the whole
universe-- scientists

00:20:30.938 --> 00:20:33.774 align:middle line:84%
tell us 96% of the
matter is missing.

00:20:33.774 --> 00:20:36.777 align:middle line:84%
96% of our universe,
they believe, is empty.

00:20:36.777 --> 00:20:41.824 align:middle line:10%
So that 4% would be compacted
into a single sphere

00:20:41.824 --> 00:20:45.870 align:middle line:10%
about the size of a green pea,
a really hot single sphere.

00:20:45.870 --> 00:20:48.456 align:middle line:84%
They tell us about 18
billion, million, million,

00:20:48.456 --> 00:20:49.874 align:middle line:90%
million degrees.

00:20:49.874 --> 00:20:51.959 align:middle line:84%
And when I talked to the
scientists about that,

00:20:51.959 --> 00:20:53.419 align:middle line:84%
I said, now how do
you really know that?

00:20:53.419 --> 00:20:54.628 align:middle line:90%
And they say, well, we don't.

00:20:54.628 --> 00:20:57.256 align:middle line:84%
[CHUCKLES] They say, but we
know that it was really hot.

00:20:57.256 --> 00:21:01.635 align:middle line:84%
So when all of that matter was
compressed into that single

00:21:01.635 --> 00:21:03.429 align:middle line:90%
green pea-- here's the key--

00:21:03.429 --> 00:21:05.055 align:middle line:90%
everything was connected.

00:21:05.055 --> 00:21:06.724 align:middle line:90%
Everything was connected.

00:21:06.724 --> 00:21:11.770 align:middle line:84%
And even though the force
of that primal release

00:21:11.770 --> 00:21:13.981 align:middle line:84%
has allowed the
universe to expand,

00:21:13.981 --> 00:21:16.942 align:middle line:84%
and it's expanding today,
and the physical matter

00:21:16.942 --> 00:21:19.612 align:middle line:84%
is no longer
physically connected,

00:21:19.612 --> 00:21:22.114 align:middle line:84%
the experiment that we
saw with the twin photons

00:21:22.114 --> 00:21:25.326 align:middle line:84%
suggests that all physical
matter is still connected,

00:21:25.326 --> 00:21:27.786 align:middle line:84%
that we are still
connected to one another.

00:21:27.786 --> 00:21:29.955 align:middle line:90%
We're connected to our planet.

00:21:29.955 --> 00:21:33.000 align:middle line:84%
We're connected to other
stars and other planets.

00:21:33.000 --> 00:21:35.669 align:middle line:84%
This is the power
of understanding

00:21:35.669 --> 00:21:38.005 align:middle line:90%
what the matrix is all about.

00:21:38.005 --> 00:21:42.635 align:middle line:84%
The key is that the matrix
is not a byproduct that

00:21:42.635 --> 00:21:44.720 align:middle line:90%
happened after the Big Bang.

00:21:44.720 --> 00:21:47.014 align:middle line:90%
Let me say this again.

00:21:47.014 --> 00:21:48.516 align:middle line:84%
The matrix that
we're talking about,

00:21:48.516 --> 00:21:53.854 align:middle line:84%
it's not something that happened
after the primal release.

00:21:53.854 --> 00:21:56.815 align:middle line:90%
The matrix is the release.

00:21:56.815 --> 00:21:58.484 align:middle line:90%
the Big Bang is the matrix.

00:21:58.484 --> 00:22:03.489 align:middle line:84%
It's emerging as
itself, into itself.

00:22:03.489 --> 00:22:05.658 align:middle line:84%
Now the implications of
what I'm saying to you

00:22:05.658 --> 00:22:08.827 align:middle line:84%
and what these experiments
are showing are mind-boggling.

00:22:08.827 --> 00:22:11.288 align:middle line:84%
We're going to explore them
throughout this series.

00:22:11.288 --> 00:22:15.543 align:middle line:84%
But I really want to
emphasize that the field that

00:22:15.543 --> 00:22:18.963 align:middle line:84%
connects all things, the web,
the net, Planck's matrix,

00:22:18.963 --> 00:22:22.716 align:middle line:84%
The Divine Matrix,
this field, it

00:22:22.716 --> 00:22:26.720 align:middle line:90%
is the release of energy itself.

00:22:26.720 --> 00:22:28.180 align:middle line:90%
Where did the field come from?

00:22:28.180 --> 00:22:30.099 align:middle line:90%
It depends on who you talk to.

00:22:30.099 --> 00:22:33.310 align:middle line:84%
The ancient Vedas, for
example, over 7,000 years

00:22:33.310 --> 00:22:35.854 align:middle line:84%
before present, they
offer us a clue.

00:22:35.854 --> 00:22:37.523 align:middle line:90%
It's not in science.

00:22:37.523 --> 00:22:40.859 align:middle line:84%
But they describe a time
before the beginning

00:22:40.859 --> 00:22:45.406 align:middle line:84%
when what they call as
Brahman, "The unborn in whom

00:22:45.406 --> 00:22:47.533 align:middle line:90%
all existing things abide.

00:22:47.533 --> 00:22:52.746 align:middle line:84%
The one manifesting as the many,
the formless putting on forms."

00:22:52.746 --> 00:22:57.209 align:middle line:84%
This is the way the Rigveda
describes this primal energy

00:22:57.209 --> 00:23:01.297 align:middle line:84%
that is happening as
this release of energy

00:23:01.297 --> 00:23:03.340 align:middle line:90%
that we call the Big Bang.

00:23:03.340 --> 00:23:05.884 align:middle line:84%
So what we're finding
is that the field that

00:23:05.884 --> 00:23:10.264 align:middle line:84%
fills the empty space, this
96% of the universe that

00:23:10.264 --> 00:23:12.516 align:middle line:84%
is believed to be missing,
it's not missing at all.

00:23:12.516 --> 00:23:14.268 align:middle line:84%
It is a form of energy
that's been with us

00:23:14.268 --> 00:23:15.769 align:middle line:90%
from the very beginning.

00:23:15.769 --> 00:23:18.689 align:middle line:84%
And this is why I think
this is so important.

00:23:21.859 --> 00:23:23.319 align:middle line:10%
And cosmologists

00:23:23.319 --> 00:23:26.614 align:middle line:10%
at the University of California
in Santa Cruz, agrees.

00:23:26.614 --> 00:23:29.992 align:middle line:10%
What he says is that "The
Big Bang did not occur

00:23:29.992 --> 00:23:31.869 align:middle line:10%
'somewhere in space.'

00:23:31.869 --> 00:23:34.288 align:middle line:10%
But it occupied
the whole of space.

00:23:34.288 --> 00:23:37.583 align:middle line:10%
The Big Bang was
space itself, bursting

00:23:37.583 --> 00:23:38.792 align:middle line:10%
into a new kind of energy."

00:23:38.792 --> 00:23:41.962 align:middle line:84%
And that's the end of
the quote from him.

00:23:41.962 --> 00:23:44.923 align:middle line:84%
So with these ideas
in mind, let's go back

00:23:44.923 --> 00:23:46.634 align:middle line:90%
to that twin photon experiment.

00:23:46.634 --> 00:23:48.260 align:middle line:90%
What really happened?

00:23:48.260 --> 00:23:50.763 align:middle line:84%
Two photons, 14
miles apart, having

00:23:50.763 --> 00:23:53.724 align:middle line:84%
exactly the same experience
at exactly the same period

00:23:53.724 --> 00:23:54.808 align:middle line:90%
of time.

00:23:54.808 --> 00:23:57.519 align:middle line:84%
How did the information
get from one to the other?

00:23:57.519 --> 00:24:00.939 align:middle line:84%
Well, that's a trick question,
because now we know it didn't.

00:24:00.939 --> 00:24:03.150 align:middle line:84%
It didn't have to get
from one to the other,

00:24:03.150 --> 00:24:05.986 align:middle line:84%
because the information
was already there.

00:24:05.986 --> 00:24:06.904 align:middle line:90%
And this is the point.

00:24:06.904 --> 00:24:08.030 align:middle line:90%
This is the controversy.

00:24:08.030 --> 00:24:09.281 align:middle line:90%
This is the mystery.

00:24:09.281 --> 00:24:11.700 align:middle line:90%
It didn't need to travel at all.

00:24:11.700 --> 00:24:13.035 align:middle line:90%
It was already present.

00:24:13.035 --> 00:24:16.413 align:middle line:84%
The experiment is telling
us that we are still

00:24:16.413 --> 00:24:18.415 align:middle line:84%
connected to people
and places, no matter

00:24:18.415 --> 00:24:22.044 align:middle line:84%
where on the universe, where
on the planet they may be.

00:24:22.044 --> 00:24:24.421 align:middle line:84%
This is why intuition
works the way

00:24:24.421 --> 00:24:26.048 align:middle line:84%
it works between a
mother and her son,

00:24:26.048 --> 00:24:29.301 align:middle line:84%
for example, in a battlefield
halfway around the world.

00:24:29.301 --> 00:24:31.220 align:middle line:84%
We'll see this in
future episodes.

00:24:31.220 --> 00:24:33.180 align:middle line:84%
This is why remote viewing
works, that we just

00:24:33.180 --> 00:24:34.056 align:middle line:90%
saw in this episode.

00:24:34.056 --> 00:24:38.477 align:middle line:84%
This is why experiments in
teleportation are working.

00:24:38.477 --> 00:24:41.438 align:middle line:10%
Russell Targ, the co-founder
of the cognitive sciences

00:24:41.438 --> 00:24:44.108 align:middle line:10%
program at Stanford
Research Institute in Menlo

00:24:44.108 --> 00:24:46.652 align:middle line:10%
Park, California, he
describes this connection

00:24:46.652 --> 00:24:48.028 align:middle line:10%
in a really beautiful way.

00:24:48.028 --> 00:24:49.738 align:middle line:10%
Listen to what he says.

00:24:49.738 --> 00:24:53.951 align:middle line:10%
Russell Targ says, "We
live in a non-local world,

00:24:53.951 --> 00:24:56.620 align:middle line:10%
where things physically
separated from one

00:24:56.620 --> 00:25:01.041 align:middle line:10%
another can nonetheless be in
instantaneous communication."

00:25:01.041 --> 00:25:02.668 align:middle line:90%
That's the end of the quote.

00:25:02.668 --> 00:25:06.004 align:middle line:84%
Well, the Big Bang and
the twin photon experiment

00:25:06.004 --> 00:25:11.260 align:middle line:84%
tells us why Targ's statement is
so powerful, why it's so true.

00:25:11.260 --> 00:25:15.848 align:middle line:10%
In 2004, physicists from
Germany and China and Austria

00:25:15.848 --> 00:25:18.600 align:middle line:10%
reported the first
successful experiment

00:25:18.600 --> 00:25:22.146 align:middle line:10%
with teleportation of
quantum information.

00:25:22.146 --> 00:25:23.897 align:middle line:10%
Results are out there
for everyone to see.

00:25:23.897 --> 00:25:26.316 align:middle line:10%
They're reported in the very
prestigious journal "Nature,"

00:25:26.316 --> 00:25:29.194 align:middle line:10%
Volume 430, in the year 2004.

00:25:29.194 --> 00:25:32.614 align:middle line:84%
And what they did was they
teleported the blueprint

00:25:32.614 --> 00:25:36.410 align:middle line:84%
for quantum particles
from one place to another.

00:25:36.410 --> 00:25:38.245 align:middle line:90%
And they did it successfully.

00:25:38.245 --> 00:25:39.747 align:middle line:90%
This was the first step.

00:25:39.747 --> 00:25:42.541 align:middle line:84%
Huge implications now
in data encryption

00:25:42.541 --> 00:25:45.419 align:middle line:84%
and in data security and
information transfer, then

00:25:45.419 --> 00:25:49.965 align:middle line:84%
ultimately, the quantum transfer
of stuff, like you and me.

00:25:49.965 --> 00:25:53.469 align:middle line:84%
So all the things that I'm
talking to you about right now,

00:25:53.469 --> 00:25:57.723 align:middle line:84%
all of these things, they're
only possible because something

00:25:57.723 --> 00:26:01.101 align:middle line:84%
exists in the nothing,
because something fills

00:26:01.101 --> 00:26:03.771 align:middle line:90%
the space of the universe.

00:26:03.771 --> 00:26:06.940 align:middle line:84%
So as excited as the scientists
are about the twin photon

00:26:06.940 --> 00:26:10.027 align:middle line:84%
experiment, about the
teleportation experiment,

00:26:10.027 --> 00:26:13.572 align:middle line:84%
in the excitement of
reporting the strangeness

00:26:13.572 --> 00:26:16.450 align:middle line:84%
of the outcomes,
I sense that they

00:26:16.450 --> 00:26:18.786 align:middle line:84%
may be missing the
most significant part

00:26:18.786 --> 00:26:22.080 align:middle line:84%
of those experiments, what those
experiments are telling us.

00:26:22.080 --> 00:26:24.291 align:middle line:84%
They may be missing the most
shattering implications,

00:26:24.291 --> 00:26:27.044 align:middle line:84%
because for all of these
experiments to work,

00:26:27.044 --> 00:26:31.173 align:middle line:84%
it means that they must be
happening within something.

00:26:31.173 --> 00:26:33.008 align:middle line:84%
We're coming back to
the same question--

00:26:33.008 --> 00:26:35.677 align:middle line:84%
what is the stuff that makes
these experiments possible?

00:26:35.677 --> 00:26:38.096 align:middle line:84%
We know it's a field,
but what is it really?

00:26:38.096 --> 00:26:39.097 align:middle line:90%
What is it made of?

00:26:39.097 --> 00:26:40.808 align:middle line:90%
How does it work?

00:26:40.808 --> 00:26:42.851 align:middle line:10%
Well, in a makeshift
laboratory hidden

00:26:42.851 --> 00:26:45.729 align:middle line:10%
in the basement of a Case
Western Reserve University

00:26:45.729 --> 00:26:49.024 align:middle line:10%
building in Cleveland,
Ohio, 100 years ago,

00:26:49.024 --> 00:26:52.152 align:middle line:10%
two scientists performed
the first experiment

00:26:52.152 --> 00:26:55.197 align:middle line:10%
that was supposed to answer
this question, once and for all.

00:26:57.741 --> 00:27:00.118 align:middle line:84%
In the next episode,
we'll see the results

00:27:00.118 --> 00:27:04.248 align:middle line:84%
of this landmark experiment
and the first scientific study

00:27:04.248 --> 00:27:07.584 align:middle line:84%
designed to detect the matrix
and the secrets that it holds.

00:27:07.584 --> 00:27:09.545 align:middle line:84%
I want to thank you
for joining me today.

00:27:09.545 --> 00:27:12.673 align:middle line:84%
Be sure to tune in for our next
all-new episode of "The Divine

00:27:12.673 --> 00:27:13.507 align:middle line:90%
Matrix"--

00:27:13.507 --> 00:27:17.719 align:middle line:84%
bridging time and space,
miracles and belief."
