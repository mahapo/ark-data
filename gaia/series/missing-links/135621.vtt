00:00:25.010 --> 00:00:26.420 align:middle line:90%
>> My name's Gregg Braden.

00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:30.080 align:middle line:84%
And I'd like to welcome you to
this very special presentation

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:34.070 align:middle line:84%
of "Missing Links: The Deep
Truth of Our Origin, History,

00:00:34.070 --> 00:00:35.660 align:middle line:90%
Destiny, and Fate."

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:38.450 align:middle line:84%
Now last episode, we
discovered that the key

00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:42.410 align:middle line:84%
to the thinking that will guide
us through our time of extremes

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:46.030 align:middle line:84%
is found in the timeless
wisdom that our ancestors asked

00:00:46.030 --> 00:00:50.550 align:middle line:84%
themselves in their time and
that science is asking today.

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:54.590 align:middle line:10%
The question is simply
this who are we?

00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:57.760 align:middle line:84%
Well new discoveries
are changing our answer.

00:00:57.760 --> 00:00:59.840 align:middle line:10%
And as they do, they're
changing the way

00:00:59.840 --> 00:01:02.550 align:middle line:10%
we think of ourselves
and the world.

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:05.390 align:middle line:84%
Today, let's zero in on
some of those discoveries

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:06.815 align:middle line:90%
and what they mean in our lives.

00:01:06.815 --> 00:01:09.460 align:middle line:90%


00:01:09.460 --> 00:01:13.390 align:middle line:84%
When I was in school back
in the 1960s and '70s,

00:01:13.390 --> 00:01:18.250 align:middle line:84%
I was taught that the
fundamental essence of matter

00:01:18.250 --> 00:01:19.300 align:middle line:90%
looked like this.

00:01:19.300 --> 00:01:21.100 align:middle line:90%
It looks like an atom.

00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:23.410 align:middle line:84%
And the atom was
a mechanical atom.

00:01:23.410 --> 00:01:26.020 align:middle line:84%
It was little things
moving around the thing.

00:01:26.020 --> 00:01:28.930 align:middle line:84%
Electrons moving
around the nucleus.

00:01:28.930 --> 00:01:30.790 align:middle line:84%
Well, today, the
atom no longer looks

00:01:30.790 --> 00:01:33.790 align:middle line:84%
like little things moving around
the thing, it looks like this.

00:01:33.790 --> 00:01:36.490 align:middle line:84%
There are fields within
fields within field,

00:01:36.490 --> 00:01:38.090 align:middle line:90%
pulsing fields of energy.

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:40.390 align:middle line:84%
This is one of the
ways that our thinking

00:01:40.390 --> 00:01:43.290 align:middle line:90%
has changed very, very quickly.

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:46.320 align:middle line:84%
We now know that
everything is energy.

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:49.860 align:middle line:84%
We now know that
everything is connected.

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:53.340 align:middle line:84%
We now know that when we
look into the universe,

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:56.920 align:middle line:84%
for example, that the stars
that we're seeing that

00:01:56.920 --> 00:01:59.280 align:middle line:84%
appear to be separate
from one another

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:01.020 align:middle line:90%
aren't really separate at all.

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:02.670 align:middle line:84%
In this image that
you're seeing,

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:05.970 align:middle line:84%
this is from the
Hubble Space Telescope.

00:02:05.970 --> 00:02:07.920 align:middle line:90%
It is an optical telescope.

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:09.990 align:middle line:84%
It looks at the
universe much the way

00:02:09.990 --> 00:02:13.230 align:middle line:84%
you and I would look
through our eyes.

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:16.440 align:middle line:84%
And when it sees the
stars and the galaxies,

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:20.776 align:middle line:84%
it sees them as separate
from one another optically.

00:02:20.776 --> 00:02:22.650 align:middle line:84%
Now I'm going to share
with you another image

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:24.600 align:middle line:90%
from another telescope.

00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:26.610 align:middle line:84%
The image that you're
seeing right now

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:30.050 align:middle line:84%
is from the Chandra
Space Telescope.

00:02:30.050 --> 00:02:33.960 align:middle line:84%
It is not an optical
telescope, it senses energy.

00:02:33.960 --> 00:02:35.850 align:middle line:84%
We're looking at the
same place in space,

00:02:35.850 --> 00:02:37.590 align:middle line:84%
but look how
different this looks.

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:39.480 align:middle line:84%
All of a sudden, those
stars and galaxies,

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:41.560 align:middle line:84%
they're no longer
separate from one another.

00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:43.260 align:middle line:90%
They're all connected.

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:45.660 align:middle line:84%
And one of the things I
find really fascinating

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:50.010 align:middle line:84%
about this connection is that
we have a sense that it's almost

00:02:50.010 --> 00:02:53.040 align:middle line:90%
like a net or a web.

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:56.310 align:middle line:84%
Interestingly enough,
our indigenous ancestors

00:02:56.310 --> 00:03:00.450 align:middle line:84%
have always told us that we
live in the web of creation.

00:03:00.450 --> 00:03:02.940 align:middle line:84%
In the Hopi tradition,
for example,

00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:07.080 align:middle line:84%
when Spider Grandmother first
emerged into this world,

00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:10.320 align:middle line:84%
she wove the web of creation
so that her children

00:03:10.320 --> 00:03:11.310 align:middle line:90%
could live their lives.

00:03:11.310 --> 00:03:16.020 align:middle line:84%
Or in the Hindu traditions,
the great god Indra

00:03:16.020 --> 00:03:19.500 align:middle line:84%
wove the web of creation
at the intersection.

00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:24.510 align:middle line:84%
At each place in the web, Indra
put a glittering jewel of light

00:03:24.510 --> 00:03:26.250 align:middle line:84%
that became the
planets and the stars

00:03:26.250 --> 00:03:28.950 align:middle line:90%
that we see in our night sky.

00:03:28.950 --> 00:03:32.490 align:middle line:84%
So these ways of thinking,
they're not scientific.

00:03:32.490 --> 00:03:34.860 align:middle line:84%
But these are the ways
that our ancestors

00:03:34.860 --> 00:03:38.140 align:middle line:84%
made sense of what they
saw in their world.

00:03:38.140 --> 00:03:41.040 align:middle line:84%
And this is where much of what
science is revealing today

00:03:41.040 --> 00:03:42.850 align:middle line:90%
parallels those traditions.

00:03:42.850 --> 00:03:45.780 align:middle line:84%
We definitely are seeing
a web-like presence.

00:03:45.780 --> 00:03:48.260 align:middle line:84%
When we think about
one another, we've

00:03:48.260 --> 00:03:50.430 align:middle line:84%
been taught that we're
separate from one another,

00:03:50.430 --> 00:03:52.620 align:middle line:84%
that we're separate from
the world around us.

00:03:52.620 --> 00:03:55.166 align:middle line:84%
And that what we
do in our bodies,

00:03:55.166 --> 00:03:56.790 align:middle line:84%
in our thoughts,
feelings, and emotions

00:03:56.790 --> 00:03:58.380 align:middle line:84%
has very little
influence on anything

00:03:58.380 --> 00:04:00.607 align:middle line:84%
beyond our own
physical body, if that.

00:04:00.607 --> 00:04:02.190 align:middle line:84%
But the new discoveries
are telling us

00:04:02.190 --> 00:04:03.720 align:middle line:90%
that's not true at all.

00:04:03.720 --> 00:04:05.400 align:middle line:84%
The new discoveries
are showing us

00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:06.900 align:middle line:90%
that we are deeply connected.

00:04:06.900 --> 00:04:12.690 align:middle line:84%
And in some ways, the connection
arises from fields of energy

00:04:12.690 --> 00:04:15.070 align:middle line:84%
that we've only
begun to understand

00:04:15.070 --> 00:04:18.660 align:middle line:84%
in the late part of the 20th
and now the early 21st century.

00:04:18.660 --> 00:04:22.970 align:middle line:84%
The heart for example, we now
know around every human heart

00:04:22.970 --> 00:04:25.290 align:middle line:90%
there is a field of energy.

00:04:25.290 --> 00:04:27.574 align:middle line:84%
Now this is a field
that we can measure

00:04:27.574 --> 00:04:28.740 align:middle line:90%
with conventional equipment.

00:04:28.740 --> 00:04:32.160 align:middle line:84%
You can go to the hardware store
and build your own detector

00:04:32.160 --> 00:04:33.820 align:middle line:84%
if you know what
you're looking for.

00:04:33.820 --> 00:04:37.200 align:middle line:84%
So this energy, it's not the
prana, it's not the aura,

00:04:37.200 --> 00:04:38.850 align:middle line:90%
it's not the chakra.

00:04:38.850 --> 00:04:43.200 align:middle line:84%
It may be related to the prana
and the aura and the chakra,

00:04:43.200 --> 00:04:45.330 align:middle line:84%
but it is an
electromagnetic field

00:04:45.330 --> 00:04:47.460 align:middle line:90%
of energy shaped like a donut.

00:04:47.460 --> 00:04:49.020 align:middle line:90%
It's called the tube torus.

00:04:49.020 --> 00:04:52.560 align:middle line:84%
And it extends between
five and eight feet

00:04:52.560 --> 00:04:55.710 align:middle line:84%
from every human
heart around us.

00:04:55.710 --> 00:04:58.650 align:middle line:84%
When I asked the
researchers who were working

00:04:58.650 --> 00:05:01.260 align:middle line:84%
with these fields-- I know
that these fields are very

00:05:01.260 --> 00:05:04.830 align:middle line:84%
powerful-- and I said,
why would they only

00:05:04.830 --> 00:05:07.350 align:middle line:90%
extend to five to eight feet?

00:05:07.350 --> 00:05:09.930 align:middle line:84%
And the researchers said,
Gregg, it's a good question.

00:05:09.930 --> 00:05:11.640 align:middle line:84%
They said the five
to the eight feet,

00:05:11.640 --> 00:05:15.190 align:middle line:84%
that is the limitation of the
equipment doing the measuring.

00:05:15.190 --> 00:05:17.690 align:middle line:84%
They said in all
probability, the field

00:05:17.690 --> 00:05:20.160 align:middle line:84%
that extends around
every human heart

00:05:20.160 --> 00:05:24.150 align:middle line:84%
is probably an infinite
field on the quantum level.

00:05:24.150 --> 00:05:29.340 align:middle line:84%
An infinite field from our
hearts extending into creation.

00:05:29.340 --> 00:05:32.490 align:middle line:84%
And that means that what we
create in that heart field

00:05:32.490 --> 00:05:35.610 align:middle line:84%
is broadcast, and in
some ways influences,

00:05:35.610 --> 00:05:37.080 align:middle line:90%
the world around us.

00:05:37.080 --> 00:05:39.390 align:middle line:84%
And that's the beauty
of understanding

00:05:39.390 --> 00:05:43.180 align:middle line:84%
the science that parallels
these ancient traditions.

00:05:43.180 --> 00:05:44.820 align:middle line:84%
We interact with
one another everyday

00:05:44.820 --> 00:05:45.945 align:middle line:90%
through these heart fields.

00:05:45.945 --> 00:05:47.940 align:middle line:84%
And new discoveries
are telling us this.

00:05:47.940 --> 00:05:49.440 align:middle line:84%
The new discoveries
are telling us

00:05:49.440 --> 00:05:54.590 align:middle line:84%
a lot about, not only our
everyday lives, but our past.

00:05:54.590 --> 00:05:58.530 align:middle line:84%
We've been conditioned to
believe, for example, that we

00:05:58.530 --> 00:06:02.040 align:middle line:84%
as humans are the product of
an evolutionary process that

00:06:02.040 --> 00:06:06.420 align:middle line:84%
began long ago and has gone
through many iterations leading

00:06:06.420 --> 00:06:07.970 align:middle line:84%
to where we find
ourselves today.

00:06:07.970 --> 00:06:09.220 align:middle line:90%
That's what we've been taught.

00:06:09.220 --> 00:06:12.780 align:middle line:84%
We've been steeped in
a story that tells us

00:06:12.780 --> 00:06:15.040 align:middle line:90%
that evolution is our story.

00:06:15.040 --> 00:06:18.240 align:middle line:84%
However, the new
science, the best science

00:06:18.240 --> 00:06:20.820 align:middle line:84%
of the 21st century,
is now telling us,

00:06:20.820 --> 00:06:24.030 align:middle line:84%
while evolution is a fact
for some forms of life,

00:06:24.030 --> 00:06:26.310 align:middle line:84%
that the theory breaks down
when it comes to humans.

00:06:26.310 --> 00:06:28.270 align:middle line:90%
Something else is happening.

00:06:28.270 --> 00:06:31.155 align:middle line:84%
So all of these
discoveries that I

00:06:31.155 --> 00:06:32.880 align:middle line:84%
am sharing with you
right now, they're

00:06:32.880 --> 00:06:37.170 align:middle line:84%
all examples of where
new discoveries are

00:06:37.170 --> 00:06:41.800 align:middle line:84%
in fact changing the story of
the way we answer the question,

00:06:41.800 --> 00:06:43.190 align:middle line:90%
who am I?

00:06:43.190 --> 00:06:45.180 align:middle line:84%
We know that we are
connected and not separate.

00:06:45.180 --> 00:06:47.930 align:middle line:84%
We know that we are
energetic beings

00:06:47.930 --> 00:06:51.660 align:middle line:84%
and that we influence the world
around us through that energy.

00:06:51.660 --> 00:06:55.040 align:middle line:84%
So what I'd like to
do right now is zero

00:06:55.040 --> 00:06:59.480 align:middle line:84%
in on one place in
this conversation.

00:06:59.480 --> 00:07:02.420 align:middle line:84%
To zero in on one
of these places

00:07:02.420 --> 00:07:04.954 align:middle line:84%
where we're taught to
think about our past

00:07:04.954 --> 00:07:06.620 align:middle line:84%
in the way that no
longer works and that

00:07:06.620 --> 00:07:09.050 align:middle line:90%
is with civilization itself.

00:07:09.050 --> 00:07:11.837 align:middle line:84%
And I was in school back
in the '60s and '70s,

00:07:11.837 --> 00:07:13.670 align:middle line:84%
I think many of you
when you were in school,

00:07:13.670 --> 00:07:16.550 align:middle line:84%
or if you have young
people in school today,

00:07:16.550 --> 00:07:18.060 align:middle line:90%
we have been taught.

00:07:18.060 --> 00:07:20.690 align:middle line:84%
We've been steeped in the
belief that civilization

00:07:20.690 --> 00:07:26.570 align:middle line:84%
began about 5,000, maybe 5,500
years ago with ancient Sumeria.

00:07:26.570 --> 00:07:29.540 align:middle line:10%
And from that
point in time there

00:07:29.540 --> 00:07:34.200 align:middle line:10%
has been a linear progression
to the point where we are today.

00:07:34.200 --> 00:07:37.445 align:middle line:10%
And we're taught that we are the
most sophisticated civilization

00:07:37.445 --> 00:07:40.290 align:middle line:10%
that has ever graced
the face of the earth.

00:07:40.290 --> 00:07:43.780 align:middle line:84%
The problem is the data
doesn't support that story.

00:07:43.780 --> 00:07:46.020 align:middle line:84%
The data doesn't
support the story.

00:07:46.020 --> 00:07:49.090 align:middle line:84%
So what you're seeing
on this screen right now

00:07:49.090 --> 00:07:54.170 align:middle line:84%
is you're seeing an image
of the line of history,

00:07:54.170 --> 00:07:56.717 align:middle line:84%
the timeline of
history, that was being

00:07:56.717 --> 00:07:57.800 align:middle line:90%
used when I was in school.

00:07:57.800 --> 00:08:00.080 align:middle line:84%
And I asked my
history professor,

00:08:00.080 --> 00:08:04.400 align:middle line:84%
I said what happened
to the left of Sumeria?

00:08:04.400 --> 00:08:07.500 align:middle line:84%
What happened before
that 5,500 years?

00:08:07.500 --> 00:08:10.890 align:middle line:84%
And I remember my professor said
to me something very powerful.

00:08:10.890 --> 00:08:12.560 align:middle line:84%
It triggered
something within me.

00:08:12.560 --> 00:08:16.430 align:middle line:84%
He said don't worry about
anything to the left.

00:08:16.430 --> 00:08:17.990 align:middle line:90%
He said that's not important.

00:08:17.990 --> 00:08:20.060 align:middle line:84%
He said history
began, civilization

00:08:20.060 --> 00:08:21.470 align:middle line:90%
began, 5,000 years ago.

00:08:21.470 --> 00:08:22.940 align:middle line:90%
And I said what?

00:08:22.940 --> 00:08:25.759 align:middle line:84%
I said you mean we don't know
what happened before that?

00:08:25.759 --> 00:08:27.050 align:middle line:90%
I said that's the place for me.

00:08:27.050 --> 00:08:28.133 align:middle line:90%
That's where I want to be.

00:08:28.133 --> 00:08:29.480 align:middle line:90%
That's where I want to look.

00:08:29.480 --> 00:08:33.380 align:middle line:84%
And I have spent much of
my adult life exploring

00:08:33.380 --> 00:08:35.870 align:middle line:84%
the new archaeological
discoveries that are now

00:08:35.870 --> 00:08:40.140 align:middle line:84%
overturning these ideas of
history and civilization

00:08:40.140 --> 00:08:41.929 align:middle line:90%
and where we began.

00:08:41.929 --> 00:08:47.000 align:middle line:84%
So if you will look to this
chart, what you're seeing

00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:50.870 align:middle line:84%
is the timeline of
what we have been

00:08:50.870 --> 00:08:53.540 align:middle line:84%
led to believe-- you see
ancient Sumeria, ancient Egypt,

00:08:53.540 --> 00:08:57.540 align:middle line:84%
and everything, the Maya, the
Inca, the Aztec, the Olmec,

00:08:57.540 --> 00:08:59.540 align:middle line:84%
the Toltec, everything
is more recent than that.

00:08:59.540 --> 00:09:02.390 align:middle line:84%
Greece and Rome, as
old as they feel to us,

00:09:02.390 --> 00:09:05.140 align:middle line:90%
they are all more recent.

00:09:05.140 --> 00:09:07.370 align:middle line:84%
I have personally had
the opportunity now

00:09:07.370 --> 00:09:11.150 align:middle line:84%
to document some of the new
discoveries that are telling us

00:09:11.150 --> 00:09:13.640 align:middle line:84%
that civilization
is much, much older.

00:09:13.640 --> 00:09:15.710 align:middle line:84%
For example, what
you're seeing right now,

00:09:15.710 --> 00:09:19.550 align:middle line:84%
this is an image of
me in 2010 documenting

00:09:19.550 --> 00:09:22.650 align:middle line:90%
a new site in northern Peru.

00:09:22.650 --> 00:09:27.440 align:middle line:84%
And this site is rocking
the world of history,

00:09:27.440 --> 00:09:31.070 align:middle line:84%
of archeology, because
it is now documented

00:09:31.070 --> 00:09:34.280 align:middle line:84%
to be the single
oldest technologically

00:09:34.280 --> 00:09:37.500 align:middle line:84%
advanced civilization in
all of the Americas in all

00:09:37.500 --> 00:09:38.300 align:middle line:90%
the Americas.

00:09:38.300 --> 00:09:40.130 align:middle line:84%
It's older than the
Inca, than the Aztec,

00:09:40.130 --> 00:09:42.040 align:middle line:90%
than the Olmec, and the Toltec.

00:09:42.040 --> 00:09:43.910 align:middle line:84%
It's older than
anything in Mexico,

00:09:43.910 --> 00:09:46.550 align:middle line:84%
older than anything
in North America.

00:09:46.550 --> 00:09:48.980 align:middle line:90%
It is called Caral.

00:09:48.980 --> 00:09:49.780 align:middle line:90%
Caral.

00:09:49.780 --> 00:09:51.500 align:middle line:90%
C-A-R-A-L. Caral, Peru.

00:09:51.500 --> 00:09:55.550 align:middle line:84%
And Caral is a mystery
to us, because we've

00:09:55.550 --> 00:10:00.390 align:middle line:84%
been taught that civilization
began 5,000 years ago.

00:10:00.390 --> 00:10:03.380 align:middle line:84%
Interestingly, that's
when this one ended.

00:10:03.380 --> 00:10:06.410 align:middle line:90%
Caral collapsed 5,000 years ago.

00:10:06.410 --> 00:10:08.360 align:middle line:84%
And what the dating
now is showing

00:10:08.360 --> 00:10:12.205 align:middle line:84%
us is that thrived for
2,000 years before that.

00:10:12.205 --> 00:10:14.690 align:middle line:90%
That's 7,000 years ago.

00:10:14.690 --> 00:10:20.630 align:middle line:84%
So if this were the only
place where the data does not

00:10:20.630 --> 00:10:25.040 align:middle line:84%
fit the traditional story, maybe
we could call it an anomaly.

00:10:25.040 --> 00:10:26.870 align:middle line:84%
But what's happening
is there are

00:10:26.870 --> 00:10:30.590 align:middle line:84%
so many anomalies that
scientists and historians have

00:10:30.590 --> 00:10:31.400 align:middle line:90%
set aside.

00:10:31.400 --> 00:10:33.997 align:middle line:84%
And they said, well, you
know these archaeological

00:10:33.997 --> 00:10:35.330 align:middle line:90%
discoveries don't fit our story.

00:10:35.330 --> 00:10:37.530 align:middle line:84%
We'll come back and
look at them later.

00:10:37.530 --> 00:10:39.320 align:middle line:84%
Now there are so
many discoveries

00:10:39.320 --> 00:10:42.170 align:middle line:84%
to come back and look at
that the discoveries are

00:10:42.170 --> 00:10:43.870 align:middle line:90%
telling a new story.

00:10:43.870 --> 00:10:46.580 align:middle line:84%
And that new story is what
we're talking about right here.

00:10:46.580 --> 00:10:50.040 align:middle line:84%
Caral was a technologically
advanced civilization.

00:10:50.040 --> 00:10:52.130 align:middle line:90%
It is about 150 acres.

00:10:52.130 --> 00:10:53.930 align:middle line:90%
So it's a large site.

00:10:53.930 --> 00:10:57.650 align:middle line:84%
Five pyramids, three
circular plazas--

00:10:57.650 --> 00:11:00.470 align:middle line:84%
like the one you're seeing
in the image right now--

00:11:00.470 --> 00:11:05.790 align:middle line:84%
and a tremendous amount of
information in a nonwritten

00:11:05.790 --> 00:11:06.590 align:middle line:90%
form.

00:11:06.590 --> 00:11:08.690 align:middle line:84%
So they weren't using
writing, but they

00:11:08.690 --> 00:11:13.040 align:middle line:84%
were using symbols and geometry
to tell us that they understood

00:11:13.040 --> 00:11:14.300 align:middle line:90%
the cosmos.

00:11:14.300 --> 00:11:16.940 align:middle line:84%
And they understood their
relationship to the cosmos.

00:11:16.940 --> 00:11:20.060 align:middle line:84%
The astronomical markers
that remain in Caral

00:11:20.060 --> 00:11:22.970 align:middle line:84%
today are indicating
relationships

00:11:22.970 --> 00:11:25.040 align:middle line:84%
that were not even known
in the Western world

00:11:25.040 --> 00:11:26.045 align:middle line:90%
until the 20th century.

00:11:26.045 --> 00:11:28.100 align:middle line:90%
Yet this was 7,000 years ago.

00:11:28.100 --> 00:11:29.510 align:middle line:90%
How did they know?

00:11:29.510 --> 00:11:31.730 align:middle line:84%
Where did they get
their information?

00:11:31.730 --> 00:11:34.460 align:middle line:84%
So when we think about
Caral, that confirmed date

00:11:34.460 --> 00:11:37.340 align:middle line:90%
7,000 years, it's old.

00:11:37.340 --> 00:11:39.270 align:middle line:90%
But it's not the oldest.

00:11:39.270 --> 00:11:41.579 align:middle line:84%
Now I know there has
been a lot of controversy

00:11:41.579 --> 00:11:43.120 align:middle line:84%
around the discoveries
that have been

00:11:43.120 --> 00:11:44.617 align:middle line:90%
made in Egypt over the years.

00:11:44.617 --> 00:11:46.617 align:middle line:84%
And I've worked with some
of the researchers who

00:11:46.617 --> 00:11:52.010 align:middle line:84%
have done beautiful work on
pushing against the mainstream

00:11:52.010 --> 00:11:53.960 align:middle line:84%
history and the
mainstream classrooms

00:11:53.960 --> 00:11:57.890 align:middle line:84%
and the mainstream textbooks
that tell us about what really

00:11:57.890 --> 00:11:58.760 align:middle line:90%
happened in Egypt.

00:11:58.760 --> 00:12:02.300 align:middle line:84%
And specifically, one of the
best preserved places in Egypt

00:12:02.300 --> 00:12:03.500 align:middle line:90%
is the Giza Plateau.

00:12:03.500 --> 00:12:08.060 align:middle line:84%
This is where we find the Great
Pyramid as well as the Sphinx.

00:12:08.060 --> 00:12:11.180 align:middle line:84%
Well as a geologist--
I'm a degreed geologist--

00:12:11.180 --> 00:12:13.310 align:middle line:84%
and I've been
fascinated by what has

00:12:13.310 --> 00:12:15.980 align:middle line:84%
happened with the
Sphinx for this reason.

00:12:15.980 --> 00:12:20.090 align:middle line:84%
The traditional dating of
the Sphinx has been about

00:12:20.090 --> 00:12:24.380 align:middle line:84%
4,400-4,500 years
before present.

00:12:24.380 --> 00:12:27.860 align:middle line:84%
So we're told that that is
when the great pharaohs built

00:12:27.860 --> 00:12:29.270 align:middle line:90%
this structure.

00:12:29.270 --> 00:12:34.250 align:middle line:84%
The problem has always been
that the Sphinx is constructed

00:12:34.250 --> 00:12:40.550 align:middle line:84%
of material, of rock, that is
in situ, in other words that

00:12:40.550 --> 00:12:43.390 align:middle line:84%
are not made of blocks that were
brought in from another place,

00:12:43.390 --> 00:12:48.290 align:middle line:84%
it was carved out of the natural
rock out of the Mother Earth.

00:12:48.290 --> 00:12:52.570 align:middle line:84%
And because of that, what
we find on that rock,

00:12:52.570 --> 00:12:54.520 align:middle line:90%
we know happened in that place.

00:12:54.520 --> 00:12:56.060 align:middle line:90%
It didn't happen somewhere else.

00:12:56.060 --> 00:12:58.240 align:middle line:84%
Well here's where this
gets really interesting.

00:12:58.240 --> 00:13:02.800 align:middle line:84%
The erosion that we
see on the shoulders

00:13:02.800 --> 00:13:05.530 align:middle line:84%
and on the back of
the Sphinx, we've

00:13:05.530 --> 00:13:09.910 align:middle line:84%
been told for years that it was
from wind, high amounts of wind

00:13:09.910 --> 00:13:14.510 align:middle line:84%
over long periods of time,
that's called Aeolian erosion.

00:13:14.510 --> 00:13:17.950 align:middle line:84%
Well when geologists from Boston
University and specifically,

00:13:17.950 --> 00:13:20.380 align:middle line:84%
Robert Schoch, when
he went in and began

00:13:20.380 --> 00:13:24.400 align:middle line:84%
examining these erosion
marks, what he found,

00:13:24.400 --> 00:13:26.560 align:middle line:84%
as a geologist-- he's
actually a stratigrapher

00:13:26.560 --> 00:13:29.950 align:middle line:84%
and a paleontologist, I believe
are the two terms that he uses

00:13:29.950 --> 00:13:34.720 align:middle line:84%
to describe his expertise-- what
he found is that the erosion is

00:13:34.720 --> 00:13:36.250 align:middle line:90%
actually not made from wind.

00:13:36.250 --> 00:13:37.690 align:middle line:90%
It's made from water.

00:13:37.690 --> 00:13:38.770 align:middle line:90%
It's not Aeolian.

00:13:38.770 --> 00:13:42.670 align:middle line:84%
It's called fluvial erosion
made from tremendous amounts

00:13:42.670 --> 00:13:45.491 align:middle line:84%
of water moving quickly
over long periods of time.

00:13:45.491 --> 00:13:46.990 align:middle line:84%
That's where the
story of the Sphinx

00:13:46.990 --> 00:13:51.310 align:middle line:84%
gets really interesting
because there has not

00:13:51.310 --> 00:13:55.210 align:middle line:84%
been vast amounts of
water moving quickly

00:13:55.210 --> 00:13:59.530 align:middle line:84%
over long periods of time
for a very, very long time.

00:13:59.530 --> 00:14:02.770 align:middle line:84%
But the scientists, Robert
Schoch, and his team, this

00:14:02.770 --> 00:14:03.820 align:middle line:90%
was their conclusion.

00:14:03.820 --> 00:14:08.200 align:middle line:84%
They published this in peer
reviewed geologic journals.

00:14:08.200 --> 00:14:10.690 align:middle line:84%
And the interesting thing was
that geologists said, sure,

00:14:10.690 --> 00:14:11.490 align:middle line:90%
it's obvious.

00:14:11.490 --> 00:14:15.160 align:middle line:84%
We have no problem with this
conclusion, the geologists.

00:14:15.160 --> 00:14:19.150 align:middle line:84%
The historians have a terrible
problem with the conclusion,

00:14:19.150 --> 00:14:22.690 align:middle line:84%
because the conclusion says the
last time that kind of water

00:14:22.690 --> 00:14:25.430 align:middle line:84%
was moving through Egypt
where the Great Sphinx is

00:14:25.430 --> 00:14:29.290 align:middle line:84%
is between 8,000 and
12,000 years ago.

00:14:29.290 --> 00:14:31.840 align:middle line:84%
Now that messes up
all the history books.

00:14:31.840 --> 00:14:33.970 align:middle line:84%
However, that is what the
science is showing us.

00:14:33.970 --> 00:14:36.820 align:middle line:84%
8,000 to 12,000
years ago, the Sphinx

00:14:36.820 --> 00:14:40.360 align:middle line:84%
would have already had to been
in place, which means maybe it

00:14:40.360 --> 00:14:44.102 align:middle line:84%
was built even before that, for
the water to begin the erosion.

00:14:44.102 --> 00:14:46.060 align:middle line:84%
In his own words, I just
want to share with you

00:14:46.060 --> 00:14:47.184 align:middle line:90%
the words of Robert Schoch.

00:14:47.184 --> 00:14:50.170 align:middle line:84%
He said, quote "I
came to the conclusion

00:14:50.170 --> 00:14:52.240 align:middle line:84%
that the oldest portions
of the Great Sphinx

00:14:52.240 --> 00:14:56.595 align:middle line:84%
must date back to an earlier
period, at least 7,000 years

00:14:56.595 --> 00:14:59.830 align:middle line:84%
and maybe as early
as 9,000 years ago,

00:14:59.830 --> 00:15:02.140 align:middle line:84%
to a time when the
climate was very different

00:15:02.140 --> 00:15:04.540 align:middle line:90%
and included more rain."

00:15:04.540 --> 00:15:08.260 align:middle line:84%
So what we're talking
about are anomalies

00:15:08.260 --> 00:15:11.080 align:middle line:84%
in the archaeological
record as we

00:15:11.080 --> 00:15:14.230 align:middle line:84%
have been asked to embrace
that record in the past.

00:15:14.230 --> 00:15:17.320 align:middle line:84%
We're looking at evidence
of advanced technological

00:15:17.320 --> 00:15:20.260 align:middle line:84%
civilizations during
a time, we were told,

00:15:20.260 --> 00:15:24.760 align:middle line:84%
only primitive mud huts
in primitive societies

00:15:24.760 --> 00:15:26.320 align:middle line:90%
were existing.

00:15:26.320 --> 00:15:28.390 align:middle line:84%
Now there so many
of these anomalies

00:15:28.390 --> 00:15:31.870 align:middle line:84%
that we can take the time
to explore, right now,

00:15:31.870 --> 00:15:33.790 align:middle line:84%
but I'd like to
cut to the chase.

00:15:33.790 --> 00:15:35.530 align:middle line:84%
I want to spend a
little bit of time

00:15:35.530 --> 00:15:40.920 align:middle line:84%
on the oldest technologically
advanced civilization

00:15:40.920 --> 00:15:44.730 align:middle line:84%
that science has now
agreed is a technologically

00:15:44.730 --> 00:15:45.750 align:middle line:90%
advanced civilization.

00:15:45.750 --> 00:15:47.190 align:middle line:84%
And they've agreed
upon the dates.

00:15:47.190 --> 00:15:49.390 align:middle line:90%
It's a very mysterious site.

00:15:49.390 --> 00:15:52.470 align:middle line:84%
It's located in southern Turkey
near the Syrian border, which

00:15:52.470 --> 00:15:55.650 align:middle line:84%
makes it a very difficult
place for archeologists

00:15:55.650 --> 00:15:58.980 align:middle line:84%
to get into right now because of
the war that's happening there.

00:15:58.980 --> 00:16:03.780 align:middle line:84%
It is called Gobekli
Tepe, Gobekli Tepe.

00:16:03.780 --> 00:16:08.070 align:middle line:84%
And it is a site that
has been on the radar

00:16:08.070 --> 00:16:11.820 align:middle line:84%
of some archeologists
for some time.

00:16:11.820 --> 00:16:15.540 align:middle line:84%
Now I'm mentioning this
because in the last episode,

00:16:15.540 --> 00:16:18.020 align:middle line:84%
we talked about the false
assumptions of science

00:16:18.020 --> 00:16:20.000 align:middle line:90%
with the inverted pyramid.

00:16:20.000 --> 00:16:23.060 align:middle line:84%
One of those false
assumptions was the assumption

00:16:23.060 --> 00:16:26.810 align:middle line:84%
that civilization
began 5,000 years ago.

00:16:26.810 --> 00:16:29.390 align:middle line:84%
This is important because
when we ask ourselves

00:16:29.390 --> 00:16:32.470 align:middle line:84%
who am I as an individual,
who are we collectively,

00:16:32.470 --> 00:16:34.400 align:middle line:84%
and we look at where
we've come from,

00:16:34.400 --> 00:16:36.530 align:middle line:84%
we've been conditioned
to think in that box

00:16:36.530 --> 00:16:39.140 align:middle line:90%
to go back only 5,000 years.

00:16:39.140 --> 00:16:43.640 align:middle line:84%
Well let me share with you what
a profound and limiting effect

00:16:43.640 --> 00:16:47.270 align:middle line:84%
that can have on a
scientist who adheres

00:16:47.270 --> 00:16:48.800 align:middle line:90%
to this kind of thinking.

00:16:48.800 --> 00:16:52.970 align:middle line:84%
In the 1960s, there was
an American archaeologist.

00:16:52.970 --> 00:16:56.730 align:middle line:84%
He heard from villagers
about this site, Gobekli Tepe

00:16:56.730 --> 00:16:58.380 align:middle line:90%
and they took him there.

00:16:58.380 --> 00:17:00.080 align:middle line:84%
And he found some
pottery on a hill.

00:17:00.080 --> 00:17:02.360 align:middle line:84%
And he began dating
this pottery.

00:17:02.360 --> 00:17:07.520 align:middle line:84%
And the dates for the
pottery came back so old

00:17:07.520 --> 00:17:10.640 align:middle line:84%
that the scientist said
they can't be right

00:17:10.640 --> 00:17:14.810 align:middle line:84%
because civilization is
only 5,000 years old.

00:17:14.810 --> 00:17:17.390 align:middle line:84%
That is what we've
all agreed upon.

00:17:17.390 --> 00:17:20.420 align:middle line:84%
So even though the pottery
told him something older

00:17:20.420 --> 00:17:23.270 align:middle line:84%
was happening, he made
a professional choice.

00:17:23.270 --> 00:17:27.380 align:middle line:10%
He walked away from this site
because he said it cannot

00:17:27.380 --> 00:17:31.310 align:middle line:10%
possibly be as old as what
the dates are now revealing.

00:17:31.310 --> 00:17:34.790 align:middle line:10%
Well it wasn't until the 1990s
that German archaeologist

00:17:34.790 --> 00:17:36.470 align:middle line:10%
returned to this site.

00:17:36.470 --> 00:17:38.000 align:middle line:90%
He did the same dating.

00:17:38.000 --> 00:17:40.520 align:middle line:84%
The difference is
he was not bound

00:17:40.520 --> 00:17:43.170 align:middle line:84%
by the rigidity of the
scientific thinking.

00:17:43.170 --> 00:17:44.390 align:middle line:90%
He wasn't in that box.

00:17:44.390 --> 00:17:46.220 align:middle line:90%
And he believed the dates.

00:17:46.220 --> 00:17:48.410 align:middle line:84%
And he very famously
said, publicly,

00:17:48.410 --> 00:17:51.440 align:middle line:84%
and he said to his
crew, to his team,

00:17:51.440 --> 00:17:54.230 align:middle line:84%
he said if I don't walk away
from this site right now,

00:17:54.230 --> 00:17:58.580 align:middle line:84%
he said I will spend the rest
of my life excavating this site.

00:17:58.580 --> 00:18:01.280 align:middle line:84%
And that is precisely what
he did until he passed

00:18:01.280 --> 00:18:02.900 align:middle line:90%
just a couple of years ago.

00:18:02.900 --> 00:18:05.150 align:middle line:90%
So what is Gobekli Tepe?

00:18:05.150 --> 00:18:06.230 align:middle line:90%
It's a mysterious site.

00:18:06.230 --> 00:18:11.840 align:middle line:84%
It is believed to be a
series of circular temples

00:18:11.840 --> 00:18:13.880 align:middle line:90%
that are buried under the earth.

00:18:13.880 --> 00:18:16.610 align:middle line:84%
Apparently they were
intentionally buried.

00:18:16.610 --> 00:18:19.520 align:middle line:84%
And I say it is believed,
because they are still buried.

00:18:19.520 --> 00:18:22.970 align:middle line:84%
Scientists are using
Earth imaging radar, earth

00:18:22.970 --> 00:18:26.150 align:middle line:84%
penetrating radar, to
look into the earth

00:18:26.150 --> 00:18:27.860 align:middle line:90%
and see these temples.

00:18:27.860 --> 00:18:30.830 align:middle line:84%
Right now, there are, I
believe, five to eight

00:18:30.830 --> 00:18:33.050 align:middle line:90%
that have been unexcavated.

00:18:33.050 --> 00:18:36.500 align:middle line:84%
They are circular temples
of vertical columns.

00:18:36.500 --> 00:18:38.810 align:middle line:84%
Scientists don't know
who put them there,

00:18:38.810 --> 00:18:42.470 align:middle line:84%
why they were there, why they
were intentionally buried.

00:18:42.470 --> 00:18:45.110 align:middle line:84%
But the fact that they
were has preserved

00:18:45.110 --> 00:18:47.030 align:middle line:84%
what has been found
to such a degree

00:18:47.030 --> 00:18:50.300 align:middle line:84%
that the hieroglyphs look
like they were made yesterday.

00:18:50.300 --> 00:18:53.090 align:middle line:84%
Some of the most
magnificent images

00:18:53.090 --> 00:18:55.580 align:middle line:84%
of what these hieroglyphs
are all about.

00:18:55.580 --> 00:18:58.160 align:middle line:84%
Some of the hieroglyphs
are very mysterious

00:18:58.160 --> 00:19:00.320 align:middle line:84%
and are now being
linked directly

00:19:00.320 --> 00:19:04.130 align:middle line:84%
to constellations
and star systems that

00:19:04.130 --> 00:19:07.470 align:middle line:84%
were not even acknowledged
until the 20th century.

00:19:07.470 --> 00:19:09.500 align:middle line:84%
So once again, we're
saying how did they know?

00:19:09.500 --> 00:19:11.510 align:middle line:90%
How did these people know?

00:19:11.510 --> 00:19:14.990 align:middle line:84%
Well one of the things that
I find really intriguing

00:19:14.990 --> 00:19:21.350 align:middle line:84%
about Gobekli Tepe is the
remains, the artifacts,

00:19:21.350 --> 00:19:23.000 align:middle line:90%
that have been found there.

00:19:23.000 --> 00:19:26.630 align:middle line:84%
And there have been a
series of images of humans

00:19:26.630 --> 00:19:28.400 align:middle line:90%
that are anatomically correct.

00:19:28.400 --> 00:19:32.450 align:middle line:84%
And everything is done really
well with one exception.

00:19:32.450 --> 00:19:34.640 align:middle line:90%
None of them have a mouth.

00:19:34.640 --> 00:19:38.097 align:middle line:84%
The mouth on every one
of these is nonexistent.

00:19:38.097 --> 00:19:39.680 align:middle line:84%
Scientists don't
know what that means.

00:19:39.680 --> 00:19:41.240 align:middle line:90%
I don't know what that means.

00:19:41.240 --> 00:19:43.740 align:middle line:84%
We've never seen anything
like that before.

00:19:43.740 --> 00:19:47.120 align:middle line:84%
And because it is so consistent
throughout the Gobekli Tepe

00:19:47.120 --> 00:19:50.930 align:middle line:84%
site, we have to think that it
has some meaning that actually

00:19:50.930 --> 00:19:55.050 align:middle line:84%
will benefit us in helping to
understand the site itself.

00:19:55.050 --> 00:19:57.680 align:middle line:84%
So we're looking at a
series of circular temples,

00:19:57.680 --> 00:20:00.497 align:middle line:84%
underground, buried
intentionally.

00:20:00.497 --> 00:20:02.330 align:middle line:84%
This is where it gets
even more interesting.

00:20:02.330 --> 00:20:07.757 align:middle line:84%
The burial of the sites
happened about 8,000 years ago.

00:20:07.757 --> 00:20:09.590 align:middle line:84%
So remember we're taught
that civilization's

00:20:09.590 --> 00:20:11.270 align:middle line:90%
only 5,000 years old.

00:20:11.270 --> 00:20:14.220 align:middle line:84%
This site was buried
8,000 years ago.

00:20:14.220 --> 00:20:18.770 align:middle line:84%
But the dating now is
pushing its origin back far

00:20:18.770 --> 00:20:20.270 align:middle line:90%
beyond that.

00:20:20.270 --> 00:20:23.660 align:middle line:84%
The scientific dating for
Gobekli Tepe as it stands right

00:20:23.660 --> 00:20:32.330 align:middle line:84%
now, is between 11,300-11,500
years before present.

00:20:32.330 --> 00:20:34.820 align:middle line:84%
It's over twice as old as
what you and I were taught

00:20:34.820 --> 00:20:35.670 align:middle line:84%
when we were in
school and what we're

00:20:35.670 --> 00:20:37.461 align:middle line:84%
teaching our young
people in the classrooms

00:20:37.461 --> 00:20:39.050 align:middle line:90%
and from the textbooks today.

00:20:39.050 --> 00:20:41.540 align:middle line:90%
11,300-11,500.

00:20:41.540 --> 00:20:45.800 align:middle line:84%
Now if we begin plugging
in some of these dates

00:20:45.800 --> 00:20:48.380 align:middle line:84%
from what are called
the anomalous sites

00:20:48.380 --> 00:20:49.940 align:middle line:84%
on the traditional
timeline-- I'm

00:20:49.940 --> 00:20:52.790 align:middle line:84%
going to do this on your
screen so you can see it-- what

00:20:52.790 --> 00:20:56.420 align:middle line:90%
we see-- here is Caral in Peru.

00:20:56.420 --> 00:20:58.860 align:middle line:90%
There is Gobekli Tepe.

00:20:58.860 --> 00:21:00.170 align:middle line:90%
There is the Great Sphinx.

00:21:00.170 --> 00:21:03.290 align:middle line:84%
There are other sites--
Catalhoyuk, for example,

00:21:03.290 --> 00:21:04.490 align:middle line:90%
another site in Turkey.

00:21:04.490 --> 00:21:09.440 align:middle line:84%
Or the Gulf of Khambhat in
India, a fascinating site

00:21:09.440 --> 00:21:12.520 align:middle line:84%
just off the shore
the Indian continent

00:21:12.520 --> 00:21:16.160 align:middle line:90%
underneath 120 feet of water.

00:21:16.160 --> 00:21:18.520 align:middle line:84%
So scientists say
either this site

00:21:18.520 --> 00:21:21.040 align:middle line:84%
was built under water
intentionally-- which

00:21:21.040 --> 00:21:23.470 align:middle line:84%
isn't likely but you have
to say that as a scientist--

00:21:23.470 --> 00:21:27.970 align:middle line:84%
or it once was above
water and became submerged

00:21:27.970 --> 00:21:30.190 align:middle line:90%
when the sea levels rose.

00:21:30.190 --> 00:21:32.260 align:middle line:84%
Well that brings up
a problem for history

00:21:32.260 --> 00:21:36.280 align:middle line:84%
because the sea levels rose
at the end of the last Ice Age

00:21:36.280 --> 00:21:39.900 align:middle line:84%
when the ice melted and the
water raised the sea levels.

00:21:39.900 --> 00:21:42.070 align:middle line:90%
That was 12,000 years ago.

00:21:42.070 --> 00:21:46.060 align:middle line:84%
So the Gulf of Khambhat, a very
mysterious site, it is huge.

00:21:46.060 --> 00:21:47.350 align:middle line:90%
It is five miles long.

00:21:47.350 --> 00:21:49.450 align:middle line:90%
It's three miles wide.

00:21:49.450 --> 00:21:53.680 align:middle line:84%
And scientists now very, very
interested in excavating this.

00:21:53.680 --> 00:21:55.210 align:middle line:84%
The problem is it's
all under water

00:21:55.210 --> 00:21:56.890 align:middle line:90%
and it adds to the complexity.

00:21:56.890 --> 00:21:58.390 align:middle line:84%
So I'm just mentioning
it so you can

00:21:58.390 --> 00:22:00.355 align:middle line:90%
see it's not just about Caral.

00:22:00.355 --> 00:22:03.100 align:middle line:84%
It's not just Gobekli
Tepe, or the Sphinx,

00:22:03.100 --> 00:22:05.020 align:middle line:84%
but there are many
sites now that

00:22:05.020 --> 00:22:06.700 align:middle line:90%
don't fit this historic model.

00:22:06.700 --> 00:22:10.180 align:middle line:84%
As a geologist, I'd like to see
what's happening on the Earth

00:22:10.180 --> 00:22:14.260 align:middle line:84%
when the civilizations
are happening in the way

00:22:14.260 --> 00:22:15.490 align:middle line:90%
that they are.

00:22:15.490 --> 00:22:18.160 align:middle line:84%
So what I'm doing is
I'm drawing for you now,

00:22:18.160 --> 00:22:20.500 align:middle line:84%
on the chart, the
blue shaded box.

00:22:20.500 --> 00:22:22.120 align:middle line:90%
That is the last Ice Age.

00:22:22.120 --> 00:22:24.790 align:middle line:84%
And it ended about
12,000 years ago.

00:22:24.790 --> 00:22:29.050 align:middle line:84%
Gobekli Tepe, being
dated to 11,500 years,

00:22:29.050 --> 00:22:32.150 align:middle line:84%
that is the date that
scientists have now.

00:22:32.150 --> 00:22:33.850 align:middle line:84%
However, they have
yet to excavate

00:22:33.850 --> 00:22:36.692 align:middle line:90%
to the bottom of the site.

00:22:36.692 --> 00:22:39.150 align:middle line:84%
So they believe that when they
get to the bottom of Gobekli

00:22:39.150 --> 00:22:42.790 align:middle line:84%
Tepe, we're going to be
looking at around a 13,000

00:22:42.790 --> 00:22:45.310 align:middle line:90%
year old archaeological site.

00:22:45.310 --> 00:22:48.570 align:middle line:84%
That pushes it into
the last Ice Age.

00:22:48.570 --> 00:22:52.180 align:middle line:84%
We are now talking about
a technologically advanced

00:22:52.180 --> 00:22:56.860 align:middle line:84%
civilization dating back
into the last Ice Age.

00:22:56.860 --> 00:22:59.350 align:middle line:84%
So what I'd like to call
your attention to is

00:22:59.350 --> 00:23:03.790 align:middle line:84%
when you look at the chart,
I'm drawing the red lines

00:23:03.790 --> 00:23:08.800 align:middle line:84%
that represent the 5,000 year
cycles that we talked about

00:23:08.800 --> 00:23:10.750 align:middle line:90%
in an earlier episode.

00:23:10.750 --> 00:23:12.250 align:middle line:90%
These are 5,000 year cycles.

00:23:12.250 --> 00:23:15.100 align:middle line:84%
They were known by
Mesoamerican traditions--

00:23:15.100 --> 00:23:17.920 align:middle line:90%
the Aztek, the Maya, the Inca.

00:23:17.920 --> 00:23:19.600 align:middle line:84%
These are the 5,000
year cycles that

00:23:19.600 --> 00:23:23.740 align:middle line:84%
were the focus of
the 2012 phenomenon

00:23:23.740 --> 00:23:25.240 align:middle line:90%
in the Mayan calendar.

00:23:25.240 --> 00:23:27.400 align:middle line:84%
So on the chart,
what you're seeing,

00:23:27.400 --> 00:23:30.430 align:middle line:84%
the red line to the right, that
is the most recent 5,000 year

00:23:30.430 --> 00:23:31.420 align:middle line:90%
cycle completion.

00:23:31.420 --> 00:23:33.190 align:middle line:90%
That was 2012.

00:23:33.190 --> 00:23:36.550 align:middle line:84%
So as you go to the left,
you see when it began.

00:23:36.550 --> 00:23:38.980 align:middle line:84%
And interestingly,
when that cycle

00:23:38.980 --> 00:23:42.820 align:middle line:84%
began the space
between the beginning

00:23:42.820 --> 00:23:45.610 align:middle line:84%
and the end of this
5,000 year cycle

00:23:45.610 --> 00:23:47.859 align:middle line:84%
encompasses everything
that we have been taught

00:23:47.859 --> 00:23:49.150 align:middle line:90%
about the history of the world.

00:23:49.150 --> 00:23:51.730 align:middle line:84%
What we have been
led to believe is

00:23:51.730 --> 00:23:53.980 align:middle line:84%
the history of the
whole world forever

00:23:53.980 --> 00:23:57.490 align:middle line:84%
is actually only the history
within the most recent 5,000

00:23:57.490 --> 00:23:58.412 align:middle line:90%
year cycle.

00:23:58.412 --> 00:24:00.870 align:middle line:84%
There was another one before
that, another one before that,

00:24:00.870 --> 00:24:02.860 align:middle line:90%
another one before that.

00:24:02.860 --> 00:24:04.810 align:middle line:84%
And what scientists
are also finding

00:24:04.810 --> 00:24:07.510 align:middle line:84%
is that it is that
these 5,000 year cycles

00:24:07.510 --> 00:24:09.370 align:middle line:90%
when the climate changes.

00:24:09.370 --> 00:24:11.380 align:middle line:84%
And that climate change
is very, very similar

00:24:11.380 --> 00:24:13.990 align:middle line:84%
to the climate change that
we're seeing right now.

00:24:13.990 --> 00:24:18.210 align:middle line:84%
It may be the trigger for the
beginning of some civilizations

00:24:18.210 --> 00:24:20.740 align:middle line:90%
and the end for others.

00:24:20.740 --> 00:24:23.240 align:middle line:84%
As the climate changes,
the way our ancestors

00:24:23.240 --> 00:24:25.460 align:middle line:90%
grew their food changed.

00:24:25.460 --> 00:24:28.970 align:middle line:84%
And they had to find new ways
to take care of themselves

00:24:28.970 --> 00:24:30.710 align:middle line:84%
and to feed the
large populations

00:24:30.710 --> 00:24:32.480 align:middle line:90%
for some of these sites.

00:24:32.480 --> 00:24:34.610 align:middle line:84%
So now what we're
looking at is we're

00:24:34.610 --> 00:24:38.420 align:middle line:84%
looking at civilization
in 5,000 year cycles

00:24:38.420 --> 00:24:42.890 align:middle line:84%
rather than a linear event
that happened once and evolved

00:24:42.890 --> 00:24:45.050 align:middle line:84%
into the sophisticated
state that we see today.

00:24:45.050 --> 00:24:47.930 align:middle line:84%
We're looking at the beginning
and the end and the beginning

00:24:47.930 --> 00:24:51.650 align:middle line:84%
and the end and the beginning
and the end of technologically

00:24:51.650 --> 00:24:53.690 align:middle line:84%
advanced civilizations
in the past.

00:24:53.690 --> 00:24:56.550 align:middle line:84%
This opens the door to
a lot of possibilities.

00:24:56.550 --> 00:24:58.640 align:middle line:84%
One of the questions,
for example,

00:24:58.640 --> 00:25:02.330 align:middle line:84%
when scientists look at some
of the most magnificent temples

00:25:02.330 --> 00:25:06.170 align:middle line:84%
remaining on the earth today,
Machu Picchu, for example,

00:25:06.170 --> 00:25:09.950 align:middle line:84%
or if they look at the Giza
Plateau and the Great Pyramid

00:25:09.950 --> 00:25:13.670 align:middle line:84%
and the Great Sphinx, or they
look at Gobekli Tepe or they

00:25:13.670 --> 00:25:17.900 align:middle line:84%
look at Caral, and they look
at what these people knew,

00:25:17.900 --> 00:25:20.940 align:middle line:84%
the cosmological knowledge,
the astronomical knowledge,

00:25:20.940 --> 00:25:23.120 align:middle line:90%
the ability to calculate cycles.

00:25:23.120 --> 00:25:26.150 align:middle line:84%
And they say, where did
this knowledge come from?

00:25:26.150 --> 00:25:30.620 align:middle line:84%
The understanding of these
cycles may be giving us a clue.

00:25:30.620 --> 00:25:34.010 align:middle line:84%
Because it's possible,
it's possible now,

00:25:34.010 --> 00:25:37.910 align:middle line:84%
that our most technologically
advanced civilizations

00:25:37.910 --> 00:25:41.330 align:middle line:84%
had a knowledge
that was perpetuated

00:25:41.330 --> 00:25:43.340 align:middle line:90%
from one civilization.

00:25:43.340 --> 00:25:46.970 align:middle line:84%
And as it collapsed, remnants
became the next civilization.

00:25:46.970 --> 00:25:48.040 align:middle line:90%
And it collapsed.

00:25:48.040 --> 00:25:50.180 align:middle line:84%
Remnants became the
next civilization.

00:25:50.180 --> 00:25:55.550 align:middle line:84%
And in that way, we are looking
at a timeline and a heritage

00:25:55.550 --> 00:25:59.480 align:middle line:84%
of knowledge of the cosmos
and wisdom of us, who we are

00:25:59.480 --> 00:26:01.160 align:middle line:90%
and where we've come from.

00:26:01.160 --> 00:26:03.050 align:middle line:84%
Now I have to say
something here.

00:26:03.050 --> 00:26:06.350 align:middle line:84%
When people look at
this, the idea of cycles

00:26:06.350 --> 00:26:08.460 align:middle line:84%
and technologically
advanced civilizations,

00:26:08.460 --> 00:26:10.820 align:middle line:90%
two questions inevitably emerge.

00:26:10.820 --> 00:26:12.140 align:middle line:90%
What about Lemuria?

00:26:12.140 --> 00:26:14.510 align:middle line:90%
What about Atlantis?

00:26:14.510 --> 00:26:18.050 align:middle line:84%
I'm sharing what I know
to be true with you.

00:26:18.050 --> 00:26:20.300 align:middle line:84%
Through the language of
peer reviewed science,

00:26:20.300 --> 00:26:22.010 align:middle line:90%
as we know it today.

00:26:22.010 --> 00:26:24.380 align:middle line:84%
Now my personal
opinion, I believe

00:26:24.380 --> 00:26:26.060 align:middle line:84%
there were advanced
civilizations

00:26:26.060 --> 00:26:29.090 align:middle line:84%
before that may have been
called Lemuria and Atlantis.

00:26:29.090 --> 00:26:31.550 align:middle line:84%
And I think we're probably
finding evidence of that.

00:26:31.550 --> 00:26:34.520 align:middle line:84%
However, it is not yet
accepted by science.

00:26:34.520 --> 00:26:36.920 align:middle line:90%
It is not yet peer reviewed.

00:26:36.920 --> 00:26:38.120 align:middle line:90%
So I want to mention that.

00:26:38.120 --> 00:26:41.120 align:middle line:84%
And this is important
because in our next episode,

00:26:41.120 --> 00:26:43.190 align:middle line:84%
we'll take the
exploration of our past

00:26:43.190 --> 00:26:46.220 align:middle line:84%
back even further
in time to a time

00:26:46.220 --> 00:26:49.280 align:middle line:84%
when modern science tells
us that all that existed

00:26:49.280 --> 00:26:53.180 align:middle line:84%
were the microscopic
precursors of ancient amoeba.

00:26:53.180 --> 00:26:56.240 align:middle line:84%
The question is how do we
explain sophisticated artifacts

00:26:56.240 --> 00:26:59.840 align:middle line:84%
that we find linked to that
very same point in time,

00:26:59.840 --> 00:27:01.520 align:middle line:90%
to that same time in history?

00:27:01.520 --> 00:27:04.070 align:middle line:10%
And the growing body
of evidence that simply

00:27:04.070 --> 00:27:06.916 align:middle line:10%
does not fit the traditional
story of our past.

00:27:06.916 --> 00:27:08.540 align:middle line:84%
We're going to thank
you for joining me
