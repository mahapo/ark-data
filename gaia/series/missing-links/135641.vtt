>>GREGG BRADEN: My
name is Gregg Braden.

00:00:26.140 --> 00:00:29.710 align:middle line:84%
And I'd like to welcome you to
this very special presentation

00:00:29.710 --> 00:00:34.000 align:middle line:84%
of "Missing Links," the deep
truth of our origin, history,

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:35.680 align:middle line:90%
destiny, and fate.

00:00:35.680 --> 00:00:38.530 align:middle line:84%
In our last episode,
we saw the experiments

00:00:38.530 --> 00:00:40.870 align:middle line:84%
that confirm in
the laboratory what

00:00:40.870 --> 00:00:43.360 align:middle line:84%
ancient and indigenous
traditions have told us

00:00:43.360 --> 00:00:46.600 align:middle line:84%
for thousands of years,
that we are literally

00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:49.570 align:middle line:84%
wired to communicate
with our body for health

00:00:49.570 --> 00:00:50.862 align:middle line:90%
and self-healing.

00:00:50.862 --> 00:00:52.570 align:middle line:84%
Well, in this episode
what I'd like to do

00:00:52.570 --> 00:00:55.510 align:middle line:84%
is go beyond the
laboratory, beyond theory,

00:00:55.510 --> 00:01:00.490 align:middle line:84%
to see this quantum link applied
in the most intimate levels

00:01:00.490 --> 00:01:02.760 align:middle line:90%
of life and community.

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:05.220 align:middle line:84%
So to illustrate
this point, I'd like

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:08.190 align:middle line:84%
to share with you a story--
it's a deeply personal story

00:01:08.190 --> 00:01:13.890 align:middle line:84%
for me-- about a time in my
life when I was first exposed

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:16.770 align:middle line:84%
to this quantum
possibility and what

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:19.290 align:middle line:84%
it means for us
on an individual,

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:21.240 align:middle line:90%
on a personal level.

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:24.980 align:middle line:10%
My home is in the high deserts
of northern New Mexico.

00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:28.320 align:middle line:84%
It's one of the most beautiful,
amazing places remaining

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:30.090 align:middle line:90%
in the world today.

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:32.400 align:middle line:84%
It is very clean,
pristine, and it

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:36.220 align:middle line:84%
is the home for a number
of indigenous communities.

00:01:36.220 --> 00:01:40.230 align:middle line:84%
And it was in the early 1990s
that an indigenous friend

00:01:40.230 --> 00:01:43.410 align:middle line:84%
of mine called me on
the phone and asked me

00:01:43.410 --> 00:01:47.760 align:middle line:84%
if I wanted to join
him to pray rain

00:01:47.760 --> 00:01:50.330 align:middle line:84%
in a very, very specific
place in the high deserts

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:52.040 align:middle line:90%
of northern New Mexico.

00:01:52.040 --> 00:01:55.880 align:middle line:84%
So a little background
here-- in the early 1990s,

00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:59.540 align:middle line:84%
one of the worst droughts in the
history of all of the American

00:01:59.540 --> 00:02:01.730 align:middle line:90%
Desert Southwest was happening.

00:02:01.730 --> 00:02:05.840 align:middle line:84%
It had been over five years
since a significant regional

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:07.790 align:middle line:90%
rainfall had happened.

00:02:07.790 --> 00:02:11.220 align:middle line:84%
So at a pre-determined
time on a very special day,

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:17.150 align:middle line:84%
we met, and we hiked
across 135,000 acres

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:21.320 align:middle line:84%
of the most beautiful,
fragrant, high-altitude sage

00:02:21.320 --> 00:02:23.360 align:middle line:84%
that you can imagine,
until we came

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:26.510 align:middle line:84%
to a place very similar to what
you're seeing on the screen

00:02:26.510 --> 00:02:27.980 align:middle line:90%
right now.

00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:33.040 align:middle line:84%
And to protect the privacy and
the integrity of my friend's

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:35.230 align:middle line:84%
traditions, we're not
showing the actual site,

00:02:35.230 --> 00:02:37.351 align:middle line:84%
and I want to be very
honest with you about that.

00:02:37.351 --> 00:02:39.850 align:middle line:84%
But it was a medicine wheel
that looked very similar to what

00:02:39.850 --> 00:02:41.800 align:middle line:90%
you're seeing right now.

00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:45.010 align:middle line:84%
And this medicine
wheel, he said to me,

00:02:45.010 --> 00:02:49.130 align:middle line:84%
this wheel has been here
for so long we don't even

00:02:49.130 --> 00:02:50.540 align:middle line:90%
know who built this.

00:02:50.540 --> 00:02:53.480 align:middle line:84%
But every stone of
this medicine wheel

00:02:53.480 --> 00:02:57.380 align:middle line:84%
is in precisely the place
where our ancestors placed it

00:02:57.380 --> 00:03:00.050 align:middle line:84%
and where we maintain
it year after year

00:03:00.050 --> 00:03:05.030 align:middle line:84%
after year, generation after
generation after generation.

00:03:05.030 --> 00:03:07.730 align:middle line:84%
And I asked my friend--
and to protect his privacy,

00:03:07.730 --> 00:03:09.360 align:middle line:90%
I'm going to call him David.

00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:10.590 align:middle line:90%
That's not his real name.

00:03:10.590 --> 00:03:13.610 align:middle line:84%
Now, I asked David,
why this place?

00:03:13.610 --> 00:03:15.260 align:middle line:84%
What's so special
about this place?

00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:16.710 align:middle line:90%
Why is the medicine wheel here?

00:03:16.710 --> 00:03:19.550 align:middle line:84%
And he said, this
is a place where

00:03:19.550 --> 00:03:23.300 align:middle line:84%
the skin between the
worlds is very thin--

00:03:23.300 --> 00:03:26.840 align:middle line:84%
where the skin between
the worlds is very thin.

00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:30.080 align:middle line:84%
So he was referring to
the veil that we sometimes

00:03:30.080 --> 00:03:33.110 align:middle line:84%
feel separates us in this
world from the possibilities

00:03:33.110 --> 00:03:34.370 align:middle line:90%
of other worlds.

00:03:34.370 --> 00:03:36.620 align:middle line:84%
So for whatever reason,
whatever anomaly,

00:03:36.620 --> 00:03:39.740 align:middle line:84%
whether it's a magnetic anomaly
or a gravitational anomaly

00:03:39.740 --> 00:03:42.800 align:middle line:84%
or a climactic
anomaly, his ancestors

00:03:42.800 --> 00:03:45.380 align:middle line:84%
had found that this
place was very effective

00:03:45.380 --> 00:03:47.630 align:middle line:90%
for the time of prayers.

00:03:47.630 --> 00:03:50.570 align:middle line:84%
So I found myself on that
day with this medicine

00:03:50.570 --> 00:03:54.485 align:middle line:84%
wheel with my friend David at
the crack between the worlds

00:03:54.485 --> 00:03:57.110 align:middle line:84%
during one of the worst droughts
in the history of the American

00:03:57.110 --> 00:03:59.360 align:middle line:90%
Desert Southwest.

00:03:59.360 --> 00:04:05.420 align:middle line:84%
My ears had heard him
invite me to pray for rain.

00:04:05.420 --> 00:04:07.130 align:middle line:90%
That's not what happened.

00:04:07.130 --> 00:04:10.280 align:middle line:84%
And without the understanding
of the previous episodes, what

00:04:10.280 --> 00:04:13.650 align:middle line:84%
I say next probably
wouldn't make much sense,

00:04:13.650 --> 00:04:16.100 align:middle line:84%
but we have the benefit
of those episodes.

00:04:16.100 --> 00:04:19.610 align:middle line:84%
So let me now share with
you exactly what happened.

00:04:19.610 --> 00:04:22.079 align:middle line:84%
I wasn't prepared
for what I saw next.

00:04:22.079 --> 00:04:24.950 align:middle line:84%
My friend David sat in
the dirt next to me.

00:04:24.950 --> 00:04:28.400 align:middle line:84%
He unlaced the shoes
of his old work boots.

00:04:28.400 --> 00:04:30.890 align:middle line:84%
And he stepped into
the medicine wheel

00:04:30.890 --> 00:04:34.160 align:middle line:84%
with just his naked
feet on the ground.

00:04:34.160 --> 00:04:35.990 align:middle line:90%
And he closed his eyes.

00:04:35.990 --> 00:04:39.350 align:middle line:84%
He carried a prayer
mudra in front of him,

00:04:39.350 --> 00:04:43.550 align:middle line:84%
just for a few seconds--
just for a few seconds.

00:04:43.550 --> 00:04:45.880 align:middle line:84%
And then he turned around,
and he looked at me.

00:04:45.880 --> 00:04:48.150 align:middle line:90%
And he said, I'm hungry.

00:04:48.150 --> 00:04:50.180 align:middle line:90%
I'm going to go for lunch.

00:04:50.180 --> 00:04:51.770 align:middle line:90%
And I said, sure.

00:04:51.770 --> 00:04:53.740 align:middle line:90%
I said, we can go for lunch.

00:04:53.740 --> 00:04:56.020 align:middle line:84%
But I said, I thought
you invited me here

00:04:56.020 --> 00:04:58.690 align:middle line:90%
to pray for rain.

00:04:58.690 --> 00:05:01.450 align:middle line:84%
And this is when he
turned and looked at me,

00:05:01.450 --> 00:05:04.650 align:middle line:84%
and what he said
changed my life.

00:05:04.650 --> 00:05:06.910 align:middle line:84%
It changed my
perspective and the way

00:05:06.910 --> 00:05:10.327 align:middle line:84%
I think about my
relationship to the world.

00:05:10.327 --> 00:05:12.160 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to share it
with you, and maybe it

00:05:12.160 --> 00:05:13.690 align:middle line:90%
will change yours as well.

00:05:13.690 --> 00:05:15.790 align:middle line:90%
Here's what he said.

00:05:15.790 --> 00:05:18.430 align:middle line:84%
I said, I thought
you prayed for rain.

00:05:18.430 --> 00:05:20.080 align:middle line:90%
And he said, no.

00:05:20.080 --> 00:05:25.330 align:middle line:84%
He said, if I prayed for
rain, rain could never happen.

00:05:25.330 --> 00:05:28.660 align:middle line:84%
Because the moment
we ask for something

00:05:28.660 --> 00:05:32.770 align:middle line:84%
to happen in this world,
in the asking for,

00:05:32.770 --> 00:05:36.690 align:middle line:84%
we are affirming that
it does not exist now.

00:05:36.690 --> 00:05:39.430 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to invite you
to think about that.

00:05:39.430 --> 00:05:42.970 align:middle line:84%
When we ask the
universe for something,

00:05:42.970 --> 00:05:46.600 align:middle line:84%
we are implying that whatever
we're asking for or asking

00:05:46.600 --> 00:05:49.780 align:middle line:84%
about or asking to appear
or asking to happen

00:05:49.780 --> 00:05:51.940 align:middle line:90%
is not present in the moment.

00:05:51.940 --> 00:05:55.480 align:middle line:84%
And in that way, we
are actually affirming

00:05:55.480 --> 00:05:59.320 align:middle line:84%
in the field the very thing
that we were hoping to change.

00:05:59.320 --> 00:06:00.970 align:middle line:90%
I hope that makes sense.

00:06:00.970 --> 00:06:03.970 align:middle line:84%
The quantum field that we talked
about in the last episode,

00:06:03.970 --> 00:06:08.140 align:middle line:84%
if you recall, it is the
container for all things.

00:06:08.140 --> 00:06:11.560 align:middle line:84%
It is the bridge between
us and the world,

00:06:11.560 --> 00:06:14.650 align:middle line:84%
between what happens in here
and what happens out there.

00:06:14.650 --> 00:06:18.430 align:middle line:84%
And it is the mirror in
our world for what we

00:06:18.430 --> 00:06:20.710 align:middle line:90%
claim to be true in our hearts.

00:06:20.710 --> 00:06:23.260 align:middle line:84%
So if you think about that,
it makes perfect sense

00:06:23.260 --> 00:06:26.110 align:middle line:84%
if you're asking for
rain, as I thought

00:06:26.110 --> 00:06:29.380 align:middle line:84%
my friend David was going to
do, if he asked that, then

00:06:29.380 --> 00:06:33.760 align:middle line:84%
the field interprets that
as him asking for no rain,

00:06:33.760 --> 00:06:37.210 align:middle line:90%
because the rain is not there.

00:06:37.210 --> 00:06:39.730 align:middle line:84%
So I looked at him,
and I said, David,

00:06:39.730 --> 00:06:42.520 align:middle line:84%
if you didn't pray
for rain right now,

00:06:42.520 --> 00:06:44.320 align:middle line:90%
what did you just do?

00:06:44.320 --> 00:06:48.310 align:middle line:84%
And he said, when
I closed my eyes,

00:06:48.310 --> 00:06:54.160 align:middle line:84%
I felt the feeling as if the
rain has already happened.

00:06:54.160 --> 00:06:57.070 align:middle line:84%
I felt the feeling
of what it feels

00:06:57.070 --> 00:07:01.090 align:middle line:84%
like, he said, to stand
in my Pueblo village

00:07:01.090 --> 00:07:04.150 align:middle line:84%
with my naked feet in
the mud, and the mud

00:07:04.150 --> 00:07:06.220 align:middle line:84%
is there because there's
been so much rain.

00:07:06.220 --> 00:07:09.070 align:middle line:84%
He said, I smelled
the smells of what

00:07:09.070 --> 00:07:13.060 align:middle line:84%
it smells like when the rain
rolls off of the earthen

00:07:13.060 --> 00:07:15.550 align:middle line:90%
walls of our Pueblo homes.

00:07:15.550 --> 00:07:17.620 align:middle line:84%
He said, I felt
the feeling of what

00:07:17.620 --> 00:07:21.100 align:middle line:84%
it feels like when I walk
through the fields of corn that

00:07:21.100 --> 00:07:22.960 align:middle line:84%
are this high against
my naked chest.

00:07:22.960 --> 00:07:25.960 align:middle line:84%
And they're this high because
there's been so much rain.

00:07:25.960 --> 00:07:29.020 align:middle line:84%
He said, I felt
the feeling of what

00:07:29.020 --> 00:07:33.760 align:middle line:84%
it feels like when my
prayer is already answered.

00:07:33.760 --> 00:07:38.470 align:middle line:84%
And then, I give thanks for
what has already happened.

00:07:38.470 --> 00:07:41.410 align:middle line:84%
He said, in those few
seconds, I felt the feelings

00:07:41.410 --> 00:07:46.790 align:middle line:84%
and I gave thanks for the rain
that has already occurred.

00:07:46.790 --> 00:07:49.330 align:middle line:84%
This is a very, very
powerful story to me.

00:07:49.330 --> 00:07:52.540 align:middle line:84%
And it illustrates
a quantum principle.

00:07:52.540 --> 00:07:54.610 align:middle line:84%
Because there is
a huge difference

00:07:54.610 --> 00:08:00.220 align:middle line:84%
between working toward an
outcome and beginning as if

00:08:00.220 --> 00:08:02.065 align:middle line:90%
the outcome is already present.

00:08:02.065 --> 00:08:04.660 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to invite you
to think about that.

00:08:04.660 --> 00:08:06.820 align:middle line:84%
When I was a young
boy growing up

00:08:06.820 --> 00:08:11.510 align:middle line:84%
in a rural community in northern
Missouri, I spent a lot of time

00:08:11.510 --> 00:08:16.010 align:middle line:84%
working in a farm environment,
in a rural environment,

00:08:16.010 --> 00:08:19.640 align:middle line:84%
baling hay, mending
fences, training bird dogs,

00:08:19.640 --> 00:08:22.370 align:middle line:84%
feeding cows, all
those kinds of things.

00:08:22.370 --> 00:08:26.810 align:middle line:84%
I'd get cuts and bruises on my
hands, my legs all the time.

00:08:26.810 --> 00:08:29.310 align:middle line:84%
And I remember my mom
would always say to me--

00:08:29.310 --> 00:08:31.190 align:middle line:84%
and it was very
well-intentioned.

00:08:31.190 --> 00:08:34.190 align:middle line:84%
But she'd say, the
healing will happen slowly

00:08:34.190 --> 00:08:35.510 align:middle line:90%
over a long period of time.

00:08:35.510 --> 00:08:38.179 align:middle line:84%
She said, it will heal a little
bit today and a little bit

00:08:38.179 --> 00:08:40.770 align:middle line:84%
tomorrow, a little
bit the next day,

00:08:40.770 --> 00:08:42.830 align:middle line:90%
until pretty soon it's all gone.

00:08:42.830 --> 00:08:44.990 align:middle line:84%
And if we embrace that,
if we think that way,

00:08:44.990 --> 00:08:47.930 align:middle line:84%
if we accept that, that
is precisely the way

00:08:47.930 --> 00:08:49.070 align:middle line:90%
the healing happens.

00:08:49.070 --> 00:08:51.590 align:middle line:84%
This is a linear way of
thinking about the world.

00:08:51.590 --> 00:08:53.750 align:middle line:84%
And I'm not saying it's
right, wrong, good, or bad,

00:08:53.750 --> 00:08:55.250 align:middle line:84%
because there are
times in our lives

00:08:55.250 --> 00:08:57.300 align:middle line:84%
we definitely want
to think linear, OK?

00:08:57.300 --> 00:09:00.980 align:middle line:90%


00:09:00.980 --> 00:09:04.922 align:middle line:84%
If you're working on an assembly
line at an auto factory,

00:09:04.922 --> 00:09:06.380 align:middle line:84%
and you're putting
together the car

00:09:06.380 --> 00:09:10.190 align:middle line:84%
that I might drive later in that
year, I want you to be linear.

00:09:10.190 --> 00:09:12.980 align:middle line:84%
I want you to do everything
step by step by step,

00:09:12.980 --> 00:09:14.180 align:middle line:90%
working toward the goal.

00:09:14.180 --> 00:09:19.640 align:middle line:84%
When the scientists
designed the Apollo capsules

00:09:19.640 --> 00:09:23.180 align:middle line:84%
to take a human to the moon and
back, it was a linear process,

00:09:23.180 --> 00:09:26.060 align:middle line:84%
step by step, each one
building on the last.

00:09:26.060 --> 00:09:28.130 align:middle line:84%
So I'm making a
distinction here.

00:09:28.130 --> 00:09:32.750 align:middle line:84%
There are times when it's good
to think linear and good to act

00:09:32.750 --> 00:09:34.570 align:middle line:90%
in a linear way.

00:09:34.570 --> 00:09:37.910 align:middle line:84%
But we have just discovered,
science is telling us,

00:09:37.910 --> 00:09:41.510 align:middle line:84%
we are not bound by the
linear laws of physics

00:09:41.510 --> 00:09:44.450 align:middle line:84%
as we know them today and
that we have the ability

00:09:44.450 --> 00:09:45.470 align:middle line:90%
to be in both worlds.

00:09:45.470 --> 00:09:47.750 align:middle line:84%
And when it comes
to our healing,

00:09:47.750 --> 00:09:50.300 align:middle line:84%
there's a huge difference
between working

00:09:50.300 --> 00:09:53.810 align:middle line:84%
toward the healing and
coming from the outcome

00:09:53.810 --> 00:09:55.880 align:middle line:84%
that the healing
has already happened

00:09:55.880 --> 00:10:00.020 align:middle line:84%
or, in the case of my friend
David, coming from the outcome

00:10:00.020 --> 00:10:03.410 align:middle line:84%
that the rain has
already appeared.

00:10:03.410 --> 00:10:06.920 align:middle line:84%
Well we went into the nearest
town, Taos, New Mexico,

00:10:06.920 --> 00:10:08.850 align:middle line:90%
we had lunch that day.

00:10:08.850 --> 00:10:11.690 align:middle line:84%
And by the time I came
back on to my property

00:10:11.690 --> 00:10:14.120 align:middle line:84%
later that afternoon,
something began

00:10:14.120 --> 00:10:17.600 align:middle line:84%
to happen that we had not
seen for a very long time.

00:10:17.600 --> 00:10:21.230 align:middle line:84%
Big, black clouds were rolling
in over the Sangre de Cristo

00:10:21.230 --> 00:10:22.400 align:middle line:90%
Mountains.

00:10:22.400 --> 00:10:24.230 align:middle line:84%
And it started to
rain that afternoon.

00:10:24.230 --> 00:10:26.670 align:middle line:84%
And it rained and
rained and rained.

00:10:26.670 --> 00:10:28.010 align:middle line:90%
It rained all afternoon.

00:10:28.010 --> 00:10:29.450 align:middle line:90%
It rained all night.

00:10:29.450 --> 00:10:31.410 align:middle line:90%
It rained all the next morning.

00:10:31.410 --> 00:10:32.210 align:middle line:90%
It was a mess.

00:10:32.210 --> 00:10:34.430 align:middle line:84%
There was so much rain,
the roads were flooded.

00:10:34.430 --> 00:10:35.450 align:middle line:90%
The fields were flooded.

00:10:35.450 --> 00:10:36.590 align:middle line:90%
Cattle were stranded.

00:10:36.590 --> 00:10:39.410 align:middle line:84%
Crops that remained were
ruined, because the ground

00:10:39.410 --> 00:10:43.130 align:middle line:84%
had been so dry it couldn't
accept all the rain.

00:10:43.130 --> 00:10:45.800 align:middle line:84%
And I called my friend
David on the phone.

00:10:45.800 --> 00:10:47.300 align:middle line:84%
And I said, David,
this is a mess.

00:10:47.300 --> 00:10:49.010 align:middle line:84%
I said, what in the
world is going on?

00:10:49.010 --> 00:10:51.800 align:middle line:84%
I said it has rained since I
saw you yesterday afternoon.

00:10:51.800 --> 00:10:52.640 align:middle line:90%
It hasn't stopped.

00:10:52.640 --> 00:10:55.520 align:middle line:84%
And he was quiet
just for a moment.

00:10:55.520 --> 00:10:57.020 align:middle line:84%
And then he said
to me on the phone,

00:10:57.020 --> 00:10:59.900 align:middle line:84%
he said, Gregg, that's
the part of the prayer

00:10:59.900 --> 00:11:02.069 align:middle line:84%
that the elders could
never describe to me.

00:11:02.069 --> 00:11:03.860 align:middle line:84%
They couldn't tell me
how to stop the rain.

00:11:03.860 --> 00:11:05.690 align:middle line:84%
They told me how
to get it started,

00:11:05.690 --> 00:11:07.760 align:middle line:84%
but I never learned
how much to make

00:11:07.760 --> 00:11:09.890 align:middle line:90%
and when to tell it to stop.

00:11:09.890 --> 00:11:12.990 align:middle line:84%
So I'm sharing this story
now for a couple of reasons.

00:11:12.990 --> 00:11:16.160 align:middle line:84%
And one of those reasons is
because I cannot say to you

00:11:16.160 --> 00:11:20.000 align:middle line:84%
as a scientist, I cannot
prove as a scientist,

00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:22.850 align:middle line:84%
that David's prayer had anything
to do with the rain that

00:11:22.850 --> 00:11:23.990 align:middle line:90%
happened.

00:11:23.990 --> 00:11:27.500 align:middle line:84%
I have to say that there
is a high correlation--

00:11:27.500 --> 00:11:31.520 align:middle line:84%
a high correlation-- between
the time that prayer was offered

00:11:31.520 --> 00:11:33.560 align:middle line:84%
and when the rain
happened, a rain that

00:11:33.560 --> 00:11:36.500 align:middle line:84%
had not happened in that
way for five years previous.

00:11:36.500 --> 00:11:39.347 align:middle line:84%
We have to say as scientists,
there's a high correlation.

00:11:39.347 --> 00:11:40.805 align:middle line:84%
Because science is
not at the place

00:11:40.805 --> 00:11:43.520 align:middle line:84%
yet where they can embrace
the mechanism, the cause

00:11:43.520 --> 00:11:45.350 align:middle line:90%
and the effect.

00:11:45.350 --> 00:11:48.250 align:middle line:84%
Well, I watched
the news that night

00:11:48.250 --> 00:11:49.760 align:middle line:90%
in that part of New Mexico.

00:11:49.760 --> 00:11:52.220 align:middle line:84%
We were able to pull
in the TV stations

00:11:52.220 --> 00:11:54.845 align:middle line:84%
from parts of Colorado,
southern Colorado,

00:11:54.845 --> 00:11:56.220 align:middle line:84%
and parts of
northern New Mexico.

00:11:56.220 --> 00:11:59.630 align:middle line:84%
And I remember the weatherman
on the Colorado station,

00:11:59.630 --> 00:12:01.460 align:middle line:90%
and he showed the weather map.

00:12:01.460 --> 00:12:03.800 align:middle line:84%
And he showed a
low-pressure system coming

00:12:03.800 --> 00:12:06.060 align:middle line:90%
across northern Colorado.

00:12:06.060 --> 00:12:07.550 align:middle line:10%
And right about
the time of Denver,

00:12:07.550 --> 00:12:11.750 align:middle line:10%
this low-pressure system
dropped and made a loop right

00:12:11.750 --> 00:12:14.540 align:middle line:10%
around northern New Mexico where
we were and came right back up.

00:12:14.540 --> 00:12:17.840 align:middle line:84%
And that low pressure is
what brought the rain.

00:12:17.840 --> 00:12:19.220 align:middle line:90%
And I remember the weatherman.

00:12:19.220 --> 00:12:22.820 align:middle line:84%
He stepped back, and he looked
at that very unusual-looking

00:12:22.820 --> 00:12:26.960 align:middle line:84%
pattern where the pressure
system just dropped.

00:12:26.960 --> 00:12:29.506 align:middle line:90%
And all he said was, huh.

00:12:29.506 --> 00:12:30.380 align:middle line:90%
That was all he said.

00:12:30.380 --> 00:12:32.810 align:middle line:84%
Because he couldn't
explain what was happening.

00:12:32.810 --> 00:12:36.170 align:middle line:84%
So I'm sharing this with
you from a perspective

00:12:36.170 --> 00:12:39.320 align:middle line:84%
of everyday life,
indigenous traditions,

00:12:39.320 --> 00:12:41.240 align:middle line:84%
what they have learned
in their lives,

00:12:41.240 --> 00:12:43.430 align:middle line:84%
and how they apply
quantum principles,

00:12:43.430 --> 00:12:47.650 align:middle line:84%
without using that term, in a
very real way in their lives.

00:12:47.650 --> 00:12:52.190 align:middle line:84%
And what science has shown
us is that high pressure

00:12:52.190 --> 00:12:55.070 align:middle line:84%
systems and low pressure
systems, climate systems,

00:12:55.070 --> 00:12:57.410 align:middle line:90%
respond to magnetic fields.

00:12:57.410 --> 00:13:00.920 align:middle line:84%
The strongest biomagnetic
field in the human body

00:13:00.920 --> 00:13:02.090 align:middle line:90%
is not in the brain.

00:13:02.090 --> 00:13:03.390 align:middle line:90%
It's in the heart.

00:13:03.390 --> 00:13:05.990 align:middle line:84%
The heart is literally
hundreds of times

00:13:05.990 --> 00:13:08.260 align:middle line:84%
stronger magnetically
than the brain is.

00:13:08.260 --> 00:13:14.150 align:middle line:84%
So I'm not surprised at the
feeling, embracing the feeling

00:13:14.150 --> 00:13:16.160 align:middle line:84%
that the rain has
already happened,

00:13:16.160 --> 00:13:19.430 align:middle line:84%
would create at least a
localized effect, rain

00:13:19.430 --> 00:13:21.905 align:middle line:84%
over a particular village
or maybe rain in a valley.

00:13:21.905 --> 00:13:24.490 align:middle line:84%
But I've never seen it
happen on a regional scale

00:13:24.490 --> 00:13:26.840 align:middle line:90%
like I did with my friend David.

00:13:26.840 --> 00:13:28.420 align:middle line:90%
So this is an example.

00:13:28.420 --> 00:13:30.180 align:middle line:90%
Again, it's not scientific.

00:13:30.180 --> 00:13:31.040 align:middle line:90%
But it's real life.

00:13:31.040 --> 00:13:35.870 align:middle line:84%
And it opened my eyes to the
possibility of quantum prayer,

00:13:35.870 --> 00:13:39.440 align:middle line:84%
where we began the
prayer from the ending.

00:13:39.440 --> 00:13:41.570 align:middle line:84%
We begin at the
place where we would

00:13:41.570 --> 00:13:44.690 align:middle line:90%
like the prayer to complete.

00:13:44.690 --> 00:13:47.000 align:middle line:84%
And I know that concept,
and if you're taking notes

00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:50.040 align:middle line:84%
and you're writing this down,
it sounds very academic.

00:13:50.040 --> 00:13:52.340 align:middle line:84%
What I'd like to do
with you now that we've

00:13:52.340 --> 00:13:54.860 align:middle line:84%
shared these experiences
and that you've

00:13:54.860 --> 00:13:58.320 align:middle line:84%
seen how the field works
and the role that it plays,

00:13:58.320 --> 00:14:01.880 align:middle line:84%
I want to take this all out
of the realm of academia,

00:14:01.880 --> 00:14:04.430 align:middle line:84%
and I want to bring this
into something real,

00:14:04.430 --> 00:14:11.390 align:middle line:84%
concrete, tangible, awesome,
profound, paradigm-shattering,

00:14:11.390 --> 00:14:14.820 align:middle line:84%
and something that, once you
see, you will always remember.

00:14:14.820 --> 00:14:18.020 align:middle line:84%
You'll never forget what
you're going to see next.

00:14:18.020 --> 00:14:20.700 align:middle line:84%
So to do this, I'm going
to share another story.

00:14:20.700 --> 00:14:25.560 align:middle line:84%
This is the story of
a healing modality

00:14:25.560 --> 00:14:30.930 align:middle line:84%
that was developed 500 years ago
in the highlands of the Tibetan

00:14:30.930 --> 00:14:32.580 align:middle line:90%
Plateau.

00:14:32.580 --> 00:14:37.110 align:middle line:84%
It is a tradition that is
very well known and accepted

00:14:37.110 --> 00:14:40.390 align:middle line:84%
in some parts of the
Asian communities,

00:14:40.390 --> 00:14:43.740 align:middle line:84%
particularly in the
medicine-less hospitals.

00:14:43.740 --> 00:14:46.030 align:middle line:84%
They are called
"medicine-less hospitals,"

00:14:46.030 --> 00:14:50.170 align:middle line:84%
almost like an oxymoron
that we see in Tibet.

00:14:50.170 --> 00:14:53.310 align:middle line:84%
And I've had the opportunity
over the period of 10 years-- I

00:14:53.310 --> 00:14:55.530 align:middle line:84%
took a number of
groups into Tibet,

00:14:55.530 --> 00:14:57.870 align:middle line:84%
I've seen these
medicine less hospitals.

00:14:57.870 --> 00:14:59.820 align:middle line:84%
And they're in other
parts of China as well.

00:14:59.820 --> 00:15:01.680 align:middle line:90%
And there is not only one.

00:15:01.680 --> 00:15:04.956 align:middle line:84%
It is a tradition of
medicine-less healing.

00:15:04.956 --> 00:15:06.330 align:middle line:84%
Because many of
the people there,

00:15:06.330 --> 00:15:08.110 align:middle line:84%
they simply don't
have health insurance.

00:15:08.110 --> 00:15:11.604 align:middle line:84%
They don't have access
to the high-tech gadgets

00:15:11.604 --> 00:15:14.020 align:middle line:84%
that many of us have in the
Western world on the one hand.

00:15:14.020 --> 00:15:18.840 align:middle line:84%
On the other hand, they need
to address the health issues

00:15:18.840 --> 00:15:20.460 align:middle line:90%
that they have.

00:15:20.460 --> 00:15:24.960 align:middle line:84%
So it was in a medicine-less
hospital where a man I know

00:15:24.960 --> 00:15:32.010 align:middle line:84%
created a video, a film, that
documents quantum healing,

00:15:32.010 --> 00:15:34.360 align:middle line:84%
a quantum healing that
happens all the time

00:15:34.360 --> 00:15:35.570 align:middle line:90%
in their part of the world.

00:15:35.570 --> 00:15:38.260 align:middle line:84%
But he documented it
on film to share it

00:15:38.260 --> 00:15:39.825 align:middle line:90%
in our part of the world.

00:15:39.825 --> 00:15:41.800 align:middle line:84%
And I'm going to be
very clear about this.

00:15:41.800 --> 00:15:46.180 align:middle line:84%
He didn't create the film to
advertise for the hospital

00:15:46.180 --> 00:15:50.110 align:middle line:84%
or to advertise for a
clinic or for the tradition

00:15:50.110 --> 00:15:51.910 align:middle line:90%
that he is teaching.

00:15:51.910 --> 00:15:55.780 align:middle line:84%
He created this film,
and I'm sharing with you,

00:15:55.780 --> 00:15:59.410 align:middle line:84%
to illustrate a potential,
a possibility, that

00:15:59.410 --> 00:16:03.130 align:middle line:84%
is so very different from
what we are led to believe

00:16:03.130 --> 00:16:05.800 align:middle line:90%
in our lives and in our world.

00:16:05.800 --> 00:16:11.140 align:middle line:10%
If you remember back to that
inverted pyramid of thinking,

00:16:11.140 --> 00:16:13.510 align:middle line:10%
the perennial
questions of science,

00:16:13.510 --> 00:16:16.330 align:middle line:10%
and the scientific assumption--
the false scientific

00:16:16.330 --> 00:16:19.470 align:middle line:10%
assumption-- that we are
separate from our bodies

00:16:19.470 --> 00:16:22.220 align:middle line:10%
and that we're separate from
the world around our bodies

00:16:22.220 --> 00:16:25.390 align:middle line:10%
and that we have
little if any influence

00:16:25.390 --> 00:16:27.340 align:middle line:10%
when it comes to us
feeling a feeling

00:16:27.340 --> 00:16:30.040 align:middle line:10%
and affecting the
physical world.

00:16:30.040 --> 00:16:32.830 align:middle line:84%
For that reason, what
you're about to see

00:16:32.830 --> 00:16:35.260 align:middle line:84%
has been very
difficult for Western

00:16:35.260 --> 00:16:40.330 align:middle line:84%
practitioners, Western doctors,
Western researchers to see.

00:16:40.330 --> 00:16:43.840 align:middle line:84%
A friend of mine
spent a lot of money

00:16:43.840 --> 00:16:46.200 align:middle line:84%
through a very
well-known organization

00:16:46.200 --> 00:16:48.700 align:middle line:84%
and went through a lot
of time investigating

00:16:48.700 --> 00:16:50.530 align:middle line:84%
alternative
modalities of healing

00:16:50.530 --> 00:16:55.390 align:middle line:84%
and published a beautiful
hard-bound volume invalidating

00:16:55.390 --> 00:16:57.430 align:middle line:90%
those modalities of healing.

00:16:57.430 --> 00:16:58.990 align:middle line:84%
And it was after
that volume had been

00:16:58.990 --> 00:17:03.010 align:middle line:84%
published I had the opportunity
to visit with this friend.

00:17:03.010 --> 00:17:05.290 align:middle line:84%
And I said, would you
like to see one more

00:17:05.290 --> 00:17:07.180 align:middle line:90%
that you haven't written about?

00:17:07.180 --> 00:17:09.579 align:middle line:84%
And I shared the video
that you're going

00:17:09.579 --> 00:17:11.440 align:middle line:90%
to see here in just a moment.

00:17:11.440 --> 00:17:14.810 align:middle line:84%
And I have to say, that friend
doesn't talk to me very much

00:17:14.810 --> 00:17:16.000 align:middle line:90%
anymore.

00:17:16.000 --> 00:17:22.180 align:middle line:84%
Because what I shared in the
film was completely different

00:17:22.180 --> 00:17:24.300 align:middle line:84%
from all the conclusions
this scientist

00:17:24.300 --> 00:17:26.230 align:middle line:84%
had come to in
the research paper

00:17:26.230 --> 00:17:29.380 align:middle line:84%
because they have never
allowed for the possibility

00:17:29.380 --> 00:17:32.142 align:middle line:84%
of the connection that
you now understand.

00:17:32.142 --> 00:17:33.850 align:middle line:84%
They've never allowed
for the possibility

00:17:33.850 --> 00:17:36.190 align:middle line:84%
of the field and
our relationship

00:17:36.190 --> 00:17:39.520 align:middle line:84%
to the field and our
ability to influence matter

00:17:39.520 --> 00:17:42.430 align:middle line:84%
through the field from the
power of human emotions,

00:17:42.430 --> 00:17:47.050 align:middle line:84%
the very emotions that have
been largely discounted

00:17:47.050 --> 00:17:50.410 align:middle line:84%
in the modern world,
in the Western world.

00:17:50.410 --> 00:17:52.000 align:middle line:84%
So the film that
you're about to see

00:17:52.000 --> 00:17:56.500 align:middle line:84%
was created in one of these
medicine-less hospitals

00:17:56.500 --> 00:17:58.100 align:middle line:90%
in China.

00:17:58.100 --> 00:18:00.730 align:middle line:84%
And let me just set this up a
little bit before we actually

00:18:00.730 --> 00:18:02.260 align:middle line:90%
see the film.

00:18:02.260 --> 00:18:05.210 align:middle line:84%
In these traditional
hospitals, people

00:18:05.210 --> 00:18:07.780 align:middle line:84%
don't have access, as I
mentioned, to high-tech gadgets

00:18:07.780 --> 00:18:09.920 align:middle line:90%
and scanners and surgery.

00:18:09.920 --> 00:18:14.470 align:middle line:84%
So a lot of what happens
in terms of their healing

00:18:14.470 --> 00:18:17.020 align:middle line:84%
is done through
traditional methods.

00:18:17.020 --> 00:18:18.640 align:middle line:84%
And traditionally,
prayer has been

00:18:18.640 --> 00:18:22.610 align:middle line:84%
a very powerful form of healing
in this part of the world.

00:18:22.610 --> 00:18:25.210 align:middle line:84%
So I want to be really
clear about this.

00:18:25.210 --> 00:18:27.730 align:middle line:84%
It's not that people walk
into a clinic with a problem

00:18:27.730 --> 00:18:30.054 align:middle line:84%
and they say, you know, I've
got lunch in 20 minutes.

00:18:30.054 --> 00:18:31.720 align:middle line:84%
Can you fix me so I
can get to my lunch?

00:18:31.720 --> 00:18:33.720 align:middle line:90%
It's not like that.

00:18:33.720 --> 00:18:35.990 align:middle line:84%
To go through one
of these clinics

00:18:35.990 --> 00:18:38.740 align:middle line:84%
and to undergo the kind of
healing you're about to see,

00:18:38.740 --> 00:18:40.600 align:middle line:90%
there's a preparation.

00:18:40.600 --> 00:18:43.255 align:middle line:84%
People are taught to change
their diet-- it's not

00:18:43.255 --> 00:18:47.320 align:middle line:84%
a surprise-- to change
their diet into really

00:18:47.320 --> 00:18:52.240 align:middle line:84%
healthy forms of raw, organic
nutrients that come to them.

00:18:52.240 --> 00:18:53.690 align:middle line:84%
They've traditionally
been organic

00:18:53.690 --> 00:18:56.410 align:middle line:84%
in this part of the world,
long before there were ever

00:18:56.410 --> 00:18:59.840 align:middle line:84%
any pesticides or GMOs
or anything like that.

00:18:59.840 --> 00:19:01.720 align:middle line:84%
But they're taught
even more than that.

00:19:01.720 --> 00:19:05.950 align:middle line:84%
They're taught about physical
movement, very specific kinds

00:19:05.950 --> 00:19:11.230 align:middle line:84%
of physical movement, forms such
as Qigong where we are moving

00:19:11.230 --> 00:19:14.020 align:middle line:84%
energy in our bodies in
very, very specific, very

00:19:14.020 --> 00:19:16.300 align:middle line:90%
precise kinds of ways.

00:19:16.300 --> 00:19:18.280 align:middle line:84%
They're taught to
change the way they

00:19:18.280 --> 00:19:20.450 align:middle line:84%
feel about themselves,
their thoughts, feelings,

00:19:20.450 --> 00:19:21.250 align:middle line:90%
and emotions.

00:19:21.250 --> 00:19:25.480 align:middle line:84%
Because those qualities are
reflected within their bodies.

00:19:25.480 --> 00:19:29.710 align:middle line:84%
So they undergo a
process of where

00:19:29.710 --> 00:19:35.140 align:middle line:84%
they are educated to begin
to think, feel, and live

00:19:35.140 --> 00:19:37.649 align:middle line:84%
in a very different
way from the way

00:19:37.649 --> 00:19:39.940 align:middle line:84%
they were thinking, living,
and feeling before that led

00:19:39.940 --> 00:19:44.110 align:middle line:84%
to whatever condition it is that
they have within their bodies.

00:19:44.110 --> 00:19:46.090 align:middle line:84%
And once they have
done that, once they've

00:19:46.090 --> 00:19:49.150 align:middle line:84%
achieved that
successfully, then it

00:19:49.150 --> 00:19:52.720 align:middle line:84%
may make sense to
undergo the experience

00:19:52.720 --> 00:19:54.520 align:middle line:90%
that you're about to see.

00:19:54.520 --> 00:19:57.850 align:middle line:84%
So the woman that you're
going to see in this healing

00:19:57.850 --> 00:20:00.640 align:middle line:84%
has gone to the traditional
medicine-less hospital.

00:20:00.640 --> 00:20:07.360 align:middle line:84%
She was diagnosed with a bladder
tumor that is inoperable, OK?

00:20:07.360 --> 00:20:11.330 align:middle line:84%
So she had gone to a big city,
and the doctors had told her,

00:20:11.330 --> 00:20:12.680 align:middle line:90%
we can't help you.

00:20:12.680 --> 00:20:14.560 align:middle line:84%
And she said, thank
you for your opinion.

00:20:14.560 --> 00:20:18.650 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to go back into
the traditions that I know.

00:20:18.650 --> 00:20:23.900 align:middle line:84%
She is in the clinic, she
is awake, she is conscious,

00:20:23.900 --> 00:20:26.420 align:middle line:90%
she is not anesthetized.

00:20:26.420 --> 00:20:28.640 align:middle line:84%
She believes in what's
about to happen to her.

00:20:28.640 --> 00:20:31.620 align:middle line:84%
She embraces what's
about to happen to her.

00:20:31.620 --> 00:20:33.770 align:middle line:84%
And she willingly
accepts the healing

00:20:33.770 --> 00:20:35.281 align:middle line:90%
that's coming to her body.

00:20:35.281 --> 00:20:37.280 align:middle line:84%
And I'm saying this to
you because people ask me

00:20:37.280 --> 00:20:39.470 align:middle line:84%
all the time, does
the person receiving

00:20:39.470 --> 00:20:42.070 align:middle line:84%
have to believe in
what's happening?

00:20:42.070 --> 00:20:44.510 align:middle line:84%
And you're going to
see the answer to that.

00:20:44.510 --> 00:20:48.050 align:middle line:84%
The short answer is the effect
is there no matter what.

00:20:48.050 --> 00:20:50.870 align:middle line:84%
Whether the effect
remains, whether it lasts,

00:20:50.870 --> 00:20:53.331 align:middle line:84%
is determined by whether
or not the person

00:20:53.331 --> 00:20:55.580 align:middle line:84%
is willing to embrace
everything that they've learned,

00:20:55.580 --> 00:20:58.730 align:middle line:84%
the new ways of living to
supporting and nurturing life

00:20:58.730 --> 00:21:00.770 align:middle line:90%
within their bodies.

00:21:00.770 --> 00:21:03.140 align:middle line:90%
So she is conscious.

00:21:03.140 --> 00:21:04.190 align:middle line:90%
She's not anesthetized.

00:21:04.190 --> 00:21:08.780 align:middle line:84%
There are three practitioners
who are standing near her.

00:21:08.780 --> 00:21:11.370 align:middle line:84%
They are trained
in the techniques.

00:21:11.370 --> 00:21:13.680 align:middle line:90%
This is an inner technology.

00:21:13.680 --> 00:21:15.020 align:middle line:90%
It is a form of Qigong.

00:21:15.020 --> 00:21:18.140 align:middle line:84%
It is a form of breathing and
moving energy into the body

00:21:18.140 --> 00:21:21.160 align:middle line:84%
and sharing that energy
with another human body.

00:21:21.160 --> 00:21:25.100 align:middle line:84%
And what makes this film
especially significant

00:21:25.100 --> 00:21:26.960 align:middle line:84%
is there's another
person in the room.

00:21:26.960 --> 00:21:32.090 align:middle line:84%
It is a technician
with an old ultrasound,

00:21:32.090 --> 00:21:35.330 align:middle line:84%
an old-fashioned monitor
that has a split screen.

00:21:35.330 --> 00:21:40.190 align:middle line:84%
So on that split screen, we can
see two images simultaneously.

00:21:40.190 --> 00:21:44.060 align:middle line:84%
The left side of
the image is going

00:21:44.060 --> 00:21:49.460 align:middle line:84%
to be a snapshot, a freeze
frame, the before image of what

00:21:49.460 --> 00:21:51.140 align:middle line:90%
it is they're dealing with.

00:21:51.140 --> 00:21:54.650 align:middle line:84%
The right side you're
going to see real time.

00:21:54.650 --> 00:21:57.080 align:middle line:84%
So this isn't a
before-and-after photograph.

00:21:57.080 --> 00:22:02.470 align:middle line:84%
I want you to see real time
how real this relationship--

00:22:02.470 --> 00:22:06.950 align:middle line:84%
your relationship-- with
the quantum field can be.

00:22:06.950 --> 00:22:08.910 align:middle line:84%
So on the right
side of the screen,

00:22:08.910 --> 00:22:11.330 align:middle line:84%
you're going to see
real time the condition

00:22:11.330 --> 00:22:14.450 align:middle line:84%
that she's been
diagnosed with disappear.

00:22:14.450 --> 00:22:18.260 align:middle line:84%
And it disappears in two
minutes and 40 seconds.

00:22:18.260 --> 00:22:19.160 align:middle line:90%
And it's real time.

00:22:19.160 --> 00:22:23.330 align:middle line:84%
This isn't a time lapse like
on a nature channel, where

00:22:23.330 --> 00:22:27.120 align:middle line:84%
you see a rosebud
open in 10 seconds

00:22:27.120 --> 00:22:29.140 align:middle line:84%
but it's something that
happens over two days.

00:22:29.140 --> 00:22:30.140 align:middle line:90%
That's not what this is.

00:22:30.140 --> 00:22:31.514 align:middle line:84%
This is real time
you're actually

00:22:31.514 --> 00:22:33.380 align:middle line:90%
going to see this happen.

00:22:33.380 --> 00:22:39.550 align:middle line:84%
At the same time, you're going
to hear the practitioners

00:22:39.550 --> 00:22:41.160 align:middle line:90%
saying a chant.

00:22:41.160 --> 00:22:43.330 align:middle line:84%
And I'm almost reluctant
to use that word,

00:22:43.330 --> 00:22:45.070 align:middle line:84%
but it is a word
that they are using,

00:22:45.070 --> 00:22:47.140 align:middle line:90%
because of the connotations.

00:22:47.140 --> 00:22:48.750 align:middle line:84%
I want to be clear
about this as well.

00:22:48.750 --> 00:22:52.720 align:middle line:84%
There's no magic word that
is making the healing happen.

00:22:52.720 --> 00:22:57.370 align:middle line:84%
The chant is a word that they
have agreed among themselves

00:22:57.370 --> 00:23:00.250 align:middle line:84%
reinforces the power of
the energy that is moving

00:23:00.250 --> 00:23:03.070 align:middle line:90%
through their bodies, OK?

00:23:03.070 --> 00:23:06.220 align:middle line:84%
So that chant that they are
saying, you're going to hear,

00:23:06.220 --> 00:23:09.655 align:middle line:84%
loosely translates
into "already done."

00:23:09.655 --> 00:23:11.120 align:middle line:90%
It's already healed.

00:23:11.120 --> 00:23:12.539 align:middle line:90%
Wa-sa.

00:23:12.539 --> 00:23:13.960 align:middle line:90%
Wa-sa.

00:23:13.960 --> 00:23:15.310 align:middle line:90%
Wa-sa.

00:23:15.310 --> 00:23:17.020 align:middle line:90%
Loosely translates.

00:23:17.020 --> 00:23:19.330 align:middle line:90%
my Chinese may not be precise.

00:23:19.330 --> 00:23:23.040 align:middle line:84%
But the point is, they
are coming from the place

00:23:23.040 --> 00:23:24.910 align:middle line:84%
that the woman is
already healed.

00:23:24.910 --> 00:23:28.960 align:middle line:84%
They are feeling the feeling
as if she is already healed.

00:23:28.960 --> 00:23:32.920 align:middle line:84%
They are claiming and
creating an energetic pattern

00:23:32.920 --> 00:23:35.920 align:middle line:84%
of an already-healed,
fully-healed, fully-enabled,

00:23:35.920 --> 00:23:38.860 align:middle line:84%
fully-capacitated woman
rather than buying

00:23:38.860 --> 00:23:41.710 align:middle line:84%
into the illusion of
the tumor that she

00:23:41.710 --> 00:23:44.710 align:middle line:90%
has temporarily in that moment.

00:23:44.710 --> 00:23:47.532 align:middle line:84%
With that, let's take
a look at this film.

00:23:47.532 --> 00:23:49.240 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to play it
all the way through,

00:23:49.240 --> 00:23:50.170 align:middle line:90%
and then we'll talk about it.

00:23:50.170 --> 00:23:52.330 align:middle line:84%
And we're going to take
this one step further.

00:23:52.330 --> 00:23:54.670 align:middle line:84%
So if you watch on
your monitor, watch

00:23:54.670 --> 00:23:58.300 align:middle line:84%
on the screen, what
you're going to see

00:23:58.300 --> 00:24:02.040 align:middle line:84%
is the film and the
narration of the man who

00:24:02.040 --> 00:24:05.430 align:middle line:90%
actually made this film.

00:24:05.430 --> 00:24:09.980 align:middle line:84%
>> --years, the center has

00:24:09.980 --> 00:24:16.660 align:middle line:84%
180 types of illnesses,
including bladder cancer.

00:24:16.660 --> 00:24:19.130 align:middle line:84%
>>GREGG: OK, so you can see
the practitioners behind.

00:24:19.130 --> 00:24:22.097 align:middle line:84%
You can see the ultrasound,
the sonogram technician.

00:24:22.097 --> 00:24:23.180 align:middle line:90%
There's the woman's tummy.

00:24:23.180 --> 00:24:24.020 align:middle line:90%
It's exposed.

00:24:24.020 --> 00:24:27.080 align:middle line:90%
She obviously is awake.

00:24:27.080 --> 00:24:30.350 align:middle line:84%
OK, and here's the
split-screen monitor.

00:24:30.350 --> 00:24:33.280 align:middle line:84%
On the left side is the snapshot
that I was talking about,

00:24:33.280 --> 00:24:35.600 align:middle line:84%
a freeze frame in
the moment in time.

00:24:35.600 --> 00:24:38.090 align:middle line:84%
And the blackness is the
emptiness of the bladder.

00:24:38.090 --> 00:24:39.780 align:middle line:90%
The lump is the tumor.

00:24:39.780 --> 00:24:43.370 align:middle line:84%
In the curve is the
floor of the bladder.

00:24:43.370 --> 00:24:45.830 align:middle line:84%
On the right-hand
side, now you're

00:24:45.830 --> 00:24:50.440 align:middle line:84%
going to see the real-time
image of the tumor, OK?

00:24:50.440 --> 00:24:53.420 align:middle line:84%
And what I'm inviting you to
do now, what you want to do,

00:24:53.420 --> 00:24:56.990 align:middle line:84%
is watch and compare what's
happening on the right side

00:24:56.990 --> 00:25:00.564 align:middle line:84%
real time with the
before image on the left.

[APPLAUSE]

00:26:07.250 --> 00:26:09.980 align:middle line:84%
>>GREGG: When we see
something like this happen,

00:26:09.980 --> 00:26:12.120 align:middle line:90%
we call it a miracle.

00:26:12.120 --> 00:26:14.810 align:middle line:84%
It's only a miracle
until we understand

00:26:14.810 --> 00:26:15.830 align:middle line:90%
what has just happened.

00:26:15.830 --> 00:26:20.420 align:middle line:84%
Then it becomes a technology,
an inner technology.

00:26:20.420 --> 00:26:23.150 align:middle line:84%
And I realize that when you
see something like this,

00:26:23.150 --> 00:26:25.370 align:middle line:84%
it means different things
to different people.

00:26:25.370 --> 00:26:29.360 align:middle line:84%
And not everyone is open
to this kind of technology.

00:26:29.360 --> 00:26:31.730 align:middle line:84%
In the year 2000, my
mother was diagnosed

00:26:31.730 --> 00:26:34.010 align:middle line:90%
with cancer in her lung.

00:26:34.010 --> 00:26:37.070 align:middle line:84%
And she knew about my work,
she had seen this film,

00:26:37.070 --> 00:26:38.030 align:middle line:90%
and I talked my mom.

00:26:38.030 --> 00:26:39.950 align:middle line:84%
And I said, how do
you feel about this?

00:26:39.950 --> 00:26:43.220 align:middle line:84%
She said, Gregg, I know that
these things are possible,

00:26:43.220 --> 00:26:44.900 align:middle line:90%
and I know that you believe it.

00:26:44.900 --> 00:26:49.850 align:middle line:84%
She said, for me, I just need
to know that this tumor is gone.

00:26:49.850 --> 00:26:52.550 align:middle line:84%
She said, I need to know that
it's no longer in my body,

00:26:52.550 --> 00:26:57.180 align:middle line:84%
and that will free me to
make the changes in my life

00:26:57.180 --> 00:26:59.570 align:middle line:84%
so that I never have
this experience again.

00:26:59.570 --> 00:27:03.440 align:middle line:84%
So in knowing that that
tumor was no longer there,

00:27:03.440 --> 00:27:06.530 align:middle line:84%
she chose to undergo
conventional surgery.

00:27:06.530 --> 00:27:09.350 align:middle line:84%
And when she came out of
that surgery, in her mind,

00:27:09.350 --> 00:27:11.720 align:middle line:84%
knowing the tumor was
no longer in her body,

00:27:11.720 --> 00:27:14.420 align:middle line:84%
freed her to experience
a new lifestyle.

00:27:14.420 --> 00:27:15.620 align:middle line:90%
She began to exercise.

00:27:15.620 --> 00:27:17.150 align:middle line:90%
She changed her diet.

00:27:17.150 --> 00:27:19.460 align:middle line:84%
She began to think
differently about herself.

00:27:19.460 --> 00:27:24.650 align:middle line:84%
And to this day, so 16 years
later, she is cancer-free.

00:27:24.650 --> 00:27:28.680 align:middle line:84%
And I honored that for, her
because that was her choice.

00:27:28.680 --> 00:27:33.020 align:middle line:84%
Not everyone is a candidate
for this kind of healing.

00:27:33.020 --> 00:27:36.110 align:middle line:84%
However, for those that
are, what I'm saying

00:27:36.110 --> 00:27:39.080 align:middle line:84%
is it's something
that we participate in

00:27:39.080 --> 00:27:41.960 align:middle line:90%
rather than having done to us.

00:27:41.960 --> 00:27:45.980 align:middle line:84%
That woman participated
in all of the preparation

00:27:45.980 --> 00:27:50.960 align:middle line:84%
before she was willing to
accept that shift in her body.

00:27:50.960 --> 00:27:52.640 align:middle line:84%
And the question
is-- I get questions

00:27:52.640 --> 00:27:56.930 align:middle line:84%
all the time about what we've
just seen-- does it last?

00:27:56.930 --> 00:27:58.550 align:middle line:84%
As I mentioned, it
will last if she

00:27:58.550 --> 00:28:00.110 align:middle line:84%
can embrace the
changes she's been

00:28:00.110 --> 00:28:02.090 align:middle line:90%
invited to make in her body.

00:28:02.090 --> 00:28:04.590 align:middle line:90%
Did it take three technicians?

00:28:04.590 --> 00:28:07.520 align:middle line:84%
Did there have to be
three technicians there?

00:28:07.520 --> 00:28:11.060 align:middle line:84%
And when I asked the gentleman
that created the film

00:28:11.060 --> 00:28:13.400 align:middle line:84%
and I asked him this
question, I said, did there

00:28:13.400 --> 00:28:15.560 align:middle line:90%
need to be three practitioners?

00:28:15.560 --> 00:28:18.440 align:middle line:84%
He said, Gregg, it's a
very interesting question,

00:28:18.440 --> 00:28:19.880 align:middle line:90%
and here's the answer.

00:28:19.880 --> 00:28:22.280 align:middle line:84%
In truth, he said,
one practitioner

00:28:22.280 --> 00:28:23.720 align:middle line:90%
could have done it.

00:28:23.720 --> 00:28:26.570 align:middle line:84%
He said, but there's
something about us humans.

00:28:26.570 --> 00:28:29.690 align:middle line:84%
We feel more empowered
when we are surrounded

00:28:29.690 --> 00:28:32.360 align:middle line:90%
by others that think as we do.

00:28:32.360 --> 00:28:34.610 align:middle line:84%
And one of the places where
that becomes very apparent

00:28:34.610 --> 00:28:37.280 align:middle line:90%
is in a healing like this.

00:28:37.280 --> 00:28:40.862 align:middle line:84%
So the question is, what did
those practitioners just do?

00:28:40.862 --> 00:28:42.320 align:middle line:84%
Well, we've already
opened the door

00:28:42.320 --> 00:28:44.970 align:middle line:84%
to this answer in
my story of David

00:28:44.970 --> 00:28:46.370 align:middle line:84%
and my story about
the difference

00:28:46.370 --> 00:28:49.700 align:middle line:84%
between working
toward an outcome

00:28:49.700 --> 00:28:52.075 align:middle line:90%
and beginning with the outcome.

00:28:52.075 --> 00:28:54.200 align:middle line:84%
As I mentioned, there is
a very powerful difference

00:28:54.200 --> 00:28:58.280 align:middle line:84%
between working from the
place that the healing,

00:28:58.280 --> 00:29:01.114 align:middle line:84%
or whatever the outcome
is, if it's a relationship,

00:29:01.114 --> 00:29:02.780 align:middle line:84%
if it's a job, if
it's a career, if it's

00:29:02.780 --> 00:29:05.090 align:middle line:84%
rain in the desert,
whatever it is,

00:29:05.090 --> 00:29:08.780 align:middle line:84%
there's a powerful difference
between working toward that

00:29:08.780 --> 00:29:13.730 align:middle line:84%
and coming from the place that
already exists in your life.

00:29:13.730 --> 00:29:16.040 align:middle line:90%
And this is not a new idea.

00:29:16.040 --> 00:29:18.416 align:middle line:84%
So I'm going to shift
gears just a little bit,

00:29:18.416 --> 00:29:21.350 align:middle line:84%
and I'm going to go back
into one of our most

00:29:21.350 --> 00:29:25.250 align:middle line:84%
ancient and cherished
spiritual traditions,

00:29:25.250 --> 00:29:28.310 align:middle line:84%
where we were given the
instructions for what you

00:29:28.310 --> 00:29:30.860 align:middle line:90%
have just seen in that film.

00:29:30.860 --> 00:29:33.680 align:middle line:84%
We were literally
given the instructions.

00:29:33.680 --> 00:29:38.110 align:middle line:84%
I think it's probably no
surprise to most of our viewers

00:29:38.110 --> 00:29:41.090 align:middle line:84%
that the modern Bible
as we see it today,

00:29:41.090 --> 00:29:45.080 align:middle line:84%
as a historical text-- I'm not
talking about religion-- just

00:29:45.080 --> 00:29:48.620 align:middle line:84%
as a document of
history, that that Bible

00:29:48.620 --> 00:29:50.690 align:middle line:90%
has undergone some revisions.

00:29:50.690 --> 00:29:53.330 align:middle line:10%
And one of the big revisions
was in the fourth century

00:29:53.330 --> 00:29:58.520 align:middle line:10%
AD, or now Common Era, CE--
the fourth century, when

00:29:58.520 --> 00:30:03.110 align:middle line:10%
about 42 or 43
books were removed

00:30:03.110 --> 00:30:05.480 align:middle line:10%
during the time of the
emperor Constantine,

00:30:05.480 --> 00:30:08.480 align:middle line:10%
or they were
condensed, rearranged,

00:30:08.480 --> 00:30:11.720 align:middle line:10%
and translated in
a way that appears

00:30:11.720 --> 00:30:14.280 align:middle line:10%
as we see those books today.

00:30:14.280 --> 00:30:17.090 align:middle line:84%
The question is, what did
we lose in those 43 books?

00:30:17.090 --> 00:30:20.300 align:middle line:84%
Well, we don't have to
ask without the answer.

00:30:20.300 --> 00:30:25.400 align:middle line:10%
Because in the 1940s, 1947,
1948, right around in there,

00:30:25.400 --> 00:30:28.040 align:middle line:10%
amazing discoveries
in the Middle East

00:30:28.040 --> 00:30:32.060 align:middle line:10%
revealed the oldest records of
the books that had been edited,

00:30:32.060 --> 00:30:36.080 align:middle line:10%
the Dead Sea Scrolls and
the Nag Hammadi library,

00:30:36.080 --> 00:30:39.740 align:middle line:10%
the Dead Sea Scrolls
from the Old Testament,

00:30:39.740 --> 00:30:42.830 align:middle line:10%
the Nag Hammadi library
from the New Testament.

00:30:42.830 --> 00:30:47.030 align:middle line:84%
And in the Nag Hammadi library
in the Gospel of Thomas,

00:30:47.030 --> 00:30:49.730 align:middle line:84%
we actually find the
instructions for the healing

00:30:49.730 --> 00:30:51.039 align:middle line:90%
that you've just seen.

00:30:51.039 --> 00:30:52.580 align:middle line:84%
I know that you've
heard this before.

00:30:52.580 --> 00:30:56.030 align:middle line:84%
You've heard the axiom,
ask and you shall

00:30:56.030 --> 00:30:59.270 align:middle line:90%
receive, that your joy be full.

00:30:59.270 --> 00:31:02.420 align:middle line:84%
You've also heard
that sometimes things

00:31:02.420 --> 00:31:03.870 align:middle line:90%
are lost in the translation.

00:31:03.870 --> 00:31:05.610 align:middle line:90%
And this is one of those places.

00:31:05.610 --> 00:31:09.650 align:middle line:84%
Because when we go back and
translate the original Aramaic

00:31:09.650 --> 00:31:14.125 align:middle line:84%
of "ask and ye shall receive,"
here's what the text says.

00:31:14.125 --> 00:31:17.030 align:middle line:84%
And I'm going to read
this to you directly.

00:31:17.030 --> 00:31:20.810 align:middle line:84%
The text says, "Ask
without hidden motive,

00:31:20.810 --> 00:31:24.320 align:middle line:84%
and be surrounded
by your answer.

00:31:24.320 --> 00:31:31.220 align:middle line:84%
Be enveloped by what you
desire, your gladness be full."

00:31:31.220 --> 00:31:34.700 align:middle line:84%
When we be surrounded
with our answer

00:31:34.700 --> 00:31:37.370 align:middle line:84%
and be enveloped
by our desire, that

00:31:37.370 --> 00:31:40.640 align:middle line:84%
is us being in the presence
of the outcome of our prayer

00:31:40.640 --> 00:31:42.810 align:middle line:90%
as if it has already happened.

00:31:42.810 --> 00:31:47.289 align:middle line:84%
So now you know how this kind
of quantum healing occurs.

00:31:47.289 --> 00:31:48.830 align:middle line:84%
The key-- I'm just
going to summarize

00:31:48.830 --> 00:31:52.640 align:middle line:84%
very quickly for you-- is
to feel as if your prayer is

00:31:52.640 --> 00:31:55.420 align:middle line:84%
already answered, is if
your body is already healed,

00:31:55.420 --> 00:31:58.220 align:middle line:84%
as if your perfect
relationship is already here,

00:31:58.220 --> 00:32:01.640 align:middle line:84%
as if your abundance
is already present.

00:32:01.640 --> 00:32:03.950 align:middle line:84%
And when you feel, invoke
all of your senses,

00:32:03.950 --> 00:32:06.620 align:middle line:90%
just like David did in the rain.

00:32:06.620 --> 00:32:13.100 align:middle line:10%
In that way, we embrace quantum
prayer in our everyday lives

00:32:13.100 --> 00:32:17.900 align:middle line:10%
and we move from a
miracle to a technology.

00:32:17.900 --> 00:32:21.830 align:middle line:10%
In our next segment, we'll
zero in on the new evidence

00:32:21.830 --> 00:32:26.900 align:middle line:10%
of human origins that tell us
now precisely why this quantum

00:32:26.900 --> 00:32:30.710 align:middle line:10%
prayer is possible for us
and no other form of life

00:32:30.710 --> 00:32:35.500 align:middle line:10%
and why it is now time for
a new story of our past.

00:32:35.500 --> 00:32:37.737 align:middle line:84%
I want to thank you for
joining me for this program.

00:32:37.737 --> 00:32:39.320 align:middle line:84%
And I'm going to
invite you to be sure

00:32:39.320 --> 00:32:42.410 align:middle line:84%
