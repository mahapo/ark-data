[THEME MUSIC]

00:00:08.330 --> 00:00:25.040 align:middle line:90%


00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:27.830 align:middle line:84%
>> Welcome to a special
series of "Missing Links,"

00:00:27.830 --> 00:00:29.930 align:middle line:84%
where your questions
get answered.

00:00:29.930 --> 00:00:32.150 align:middle line:10%
I'm your host, Tiffany
Bush, and I'm also

00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:34.610 align:middle line:10%
the head of the member
support team here at Gaia.

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:37.666 align:middle line:84%
And with me today is the star
of the show, Gregg Braden.

00:00:37.666 --> 00:00:40.040 align:middle line:10%
We're here to answer your
questions from the first season

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:41.150 align:middle line:10%
of "Missing Links."

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:42.990 align:middle line:84%
Gregg, it's a
pleasure to have you.

00:00:42.990 --> 00:00:44.640 align:middle line:84%
Thank you so much
for joining me today.

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:45.650 align:middle line:90%
>> Thank you so much.

00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:46.608 align:middle line:90%
I don't know about you.

00:00:46.608 --> 00:00:48.733 align:middle line:84%
Does it seem like these
sessions go by really fast?

00:00:48.733 --> 00:00:49.533 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:00:49.533 --> 00:00:50.957 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:00:50.957 --> 00:00:52.040 align:middle line:90%
>> It does for me as well.

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:53.450 align:middle line:84%
I know the title of
what we're doing today.

00:00:53.450 --> 00:00:54.860 align:middle line:84%
I don't know the
questions, and I'm really

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:56.250 align:middle line:84%
excited to talk
about this topic.

00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:58.300 align:middle line:84%
So I'm going to let you
lead with first question.

00:00:58.300 --> 00:00:59.100 align:middle line:90%
>> Thank you.

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:00.766 align:middle line:84%
I'm so excited to
share these questions.

00:01:00.766 --> 00:01:03.950 align:middle line:84%
We get so many from the members
that have all these burning

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:04.750 align:middle line:90%
questions.

00:01:04.750 --> 00:01:06.329 align:middle line:90%
The first one is from Aaron.

00:01:06.329 --> 00:01:08.120 align:middle line:84%
He wants to know, is
it possible that there

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:12.310 align:middle line:84%
were civilizations that dated
back to billions of years?

00:01:12.310 --> 00:01:15.350 align:middle line:84%
>> As a degreed
geologist, scientifically,

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:19.400 align:middle line:84%
I have to say the answer
is probably not possible

00:01:19.400 --> 00:01:24.320 align:middle line:84%
because Earth, right now, is
scientifically dated at 4.5

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:25.857 align:middle line:90%
billion years old.

00:01:25.857 --> 00:01:27.690 align:middle line:84%
And that comes from
three different sources.

00:01:27.690 --> 00:01:31.610 align:middle line:84%
They've dated the solar
system itself, meteorites.

00:01:31.610 --> 00:01:35.540 align:middle line:84%
There's a process of dating
lead isotopes on the Earth,

00:01:35.540 --> 00:01:37.580 align:middle line:84%
and the age of the crust
of the Earth itself.

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:39.730 align:middle line:84%
And all three of those--
if it was just one,

00:01:39.730 --> 00:01:41.630 align:middle line:90%
I could question it.

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:44.540 align:middle line:84%
All three of them are pointing
to the same date, 4.5 billion

00:01:44.540 --> 00:01:47.474 align:middle line:90%
years, when the Earth formed.

00:01:47.474 --> 00:01:48.890 align:middle line:84%
And after the Earth
formed, it had

00:01:48.890 --> 00:01:51.560 align:middle line:84%
to go through a
cooling process that

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:53.090 align:middle line:90%
would take quite a bit of time.

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:57.200 align:middle line:84%
So I think what we're
finding is that civilization

00:01:57.200 --> 00:02:01.200 align:middle line:84%
is much older than we've
ever been led to believe.

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:03.020 align:middle line:84%
And I think we're
probably talking--

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:06.230 align:middle line:84%
now, we've been led to
believe that civilization,

00:02:06.230 --> 00:02:08.930 align:middle line:84%
that modern civilization,
advanced technological

00:02:08.930 --> 00:02:13.100 align:middle line:84%
civilization, began about
5,000, 5,500 years ago.

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:16.580 align:middle line:84%
Scientifically, that date is now
pushed back almost three times

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:19.580 align:middle line:90%
to 15,000 years before present.

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:24.590 align:middle line:84%
So Gobekli Tepe is now
dated into the last ice age.

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:27.140 align:middle line:84%
However, I believe
the new evidence--

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:29.570 align:middle line:84%
this is changing so
quickly, Tiffany.

00:02:29.570 --> 00:02:33.980 align:middle line:10%
As climate change melts
the ice on Antarctica,

00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:37.490 align:middle line:10%
on the continent of Antarctica,
the Earth penetrating radar

00:02:37.490 --> 00:02:40.880 align:middle line:10%
is now able to pick up images
underneath that ice suggesting,

00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:45.560 align:middle line:10%
large scale complex civilization
at the bottom of the ice,

00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:47.690 align:middle line:10%
and that implies
one of two things.

00:02:47.690 --> 00:02:49.621 align:middle line:84%
Either it was built
while the ice was there,

00:02:49.621 --> 00:02:51.620 align:middle line:84%
somebody dug down through
the ice to build this,

00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:55.250 align:middle line:84%
or it was there
when the ice formed,

00:02:55.250 --> 00:02:58.317 align:middle line:84%
and that dates back
over 20,000 plus years.

00:02:58.317 --> 00:02:59.900 align:middle line:84%
So I think what we're
finding is we're

00:02:59.900 --> 00:03:02.570 align:middle line:84%
writing a new history
of civilization,

00:03:02.570 --> 00:03:04.630 align:middle line:84%
and the dates are
changing so fast.

00:03:04.630 --> 00:03:06.880 align:middle line:84%
The textbooks and the
classrooms have yet to catch up,

00:03:06.880 --> 00:03:09.530 align:middle line:84%
and we're still teaching our
young people civilization is

00:03:09.530 --> 00:03:11.170 align:middle line:90%
5,000 years old.

00:03:11.170 --> 00:03:12.440 align:middle line:90%
>> Thank you.

00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:15.440 align:middle line:10%
So Jeff P wants
to know, what are

00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:18.680 align:middle line:10%
your thoughts on
extraterrestrial involvement

00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:20.720 align:middle line:10%
in the origin of humanity?

00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:23.330 align:middle line:10%
And did extraterrestrial
fellow beings

00:03:23.330 --> 00:03:25.490 align:middle line:10%
create us in their image?

00:03:25.490 --> 00:03:27.780 align:middle line:84%
>> Sure this, again, it
comes down to language.

00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:31.010 align:middle line:84%
It depends on how we
define extraterrestrial.

00:03:31.010 --> 00:03:33.110 align:middle line:90%
What I'll say is the science--

00:03:33.110 --> 00:03:35.870 align:middle line:84%
and I do talk about
this in "Missing Links."

00:03:35.870 --> 00:03:38.420 align:middle line:84%
The new genetic
discoveries are telling us,

00:03:38.420 --> 00:03:41.182 align:middle line:84%
beyond any reasonable
doubt, that evolution

00:03:41.182 --> 00:03:43.640 align:middle line:84%
as we've been led to believe,
Darwin's theory of evolution,

00:03:43.640 --> 00:03:44.930 align:middle line:90%
is a fact in the world.

00:03:44.930 --> 00:03:47.480 align:middle line:90%
It is not the human story.

00:03:47.480 --> 00:03:51.290 align:middle line:84%
Humans appeared suddenly on
Earth about 200,000 years ago.

00:03:51.290 --> 00:03:53.360 align:middle line:84%
We have not changed
since we appeared.

00:03:53.360 --> 00:03:56.660 align:middle line:84%
We are today as we
were 200,000 years ago.

00:03:56.660 --> 00:03:59.000 align:middle line:84%
That's not Darwin's
idea of evolution.

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:02.840 align:middle line:10%
And what makes us who we are,
what gives us our humanness,

00:04:02.840 --> 00:04:09.380 align:middle line:10%
is the result of a genetic
fusion, a fusion of DNA,

00:04:09.380 --> 00:04:12.245 align:middle line:10%
that gives us the human
qualities, specifically

00:04:12.245 --> 00:04:14.240 align:middle line:10%
in human chromosome number two.

00:04:14.240 --> 00:04:18.050 align:middle line:10%
We now know that this is the
result of a fusion of DNA

00:04:18.050 --> 00:04:19.279 align:middle line:10%
beyond the fusion.

00:04:19.279 --> 00:04:21.320 align:middle line:84%
Fusions we see sometimes
happen in nature,

00:04:21.320 --> 00:04:22.850 align:middle line:90%
but here's the giveaway.

00:04:22.850 --> 00:04:26.840 align:middle line:84%
After the chromosomes were fused
to give us our human chromosome

00:04:26.840 --> 00:04:28.490 align:middle line:84%
number two-- second
largest chromosome

00:04:28.490 --> 00:04:31.330 align:middle line:84%
in the human body,
8% of every cell.

00:04:31.330 --> 00:04:33.140 align:middle line:84%
It's the chromosome
that gives us

00:04:33.140 --> 00:04:37.490 align:middle line:84%
the cortex in our brain, that
allows us logic, compassion,

00:04:37.490 --> 00:04:40.550 align:middle line:84%
empathy, sympathy-- all of that
comes from human chromosome

00:04:40.550 --> 00:04:42.320 align:middle line:90%
number two.

00:04:42.320 --> 00:04:47.565 align:middle line:84%
After the chromosomes were
fused to give us that, there--

00:04:47.565 --> 00:04:50.520 align:middle line:90%


00:04:50.520 --> 00:04:54.240 align:middle line:84%
two complete and whole
chromosomes were fused.

00:04:54.240 --> 00:04:56.010 align:middle line:84%
Once that fusion
happened, you can

00:04:56.010 --> 00:04:58.260 align:middle line:84%
see where there would be
overlapping or redundant

00:04:58.260 --> 00:05:00.340 align:middle line:84%
functions because they
were complete before,

00:05:00.340 --> 00:05:02.370 align:middle line:84%
and now, when you
put them together,

00:05:02.370 --> 00:05:04.200 align:middle line:84%
those functions are
going to overlap.

00:05:04.200 --> 00:05:07.440 align:middle line:84%
So those overlapping
functions were turned off,

00:05:07.440 --> 00:05:11.220 align:middle line:84%
and in some cases, removed
completely to optimize

00:05:11.220 --> 00:05:13.490 align:middle line:90%
the new human chromosome two.

00:05:13.490 --> 00:05:15.900 align:middle line:84%
That's something that
cannot happen in evolution,

00:05:15.900 --> 00:05:17.550 align:middle line:90%
at least as we know it today.

00:05:17.550 --> 00:05:19.860 align:middle line:90%
It implies an intentionality.

00:05:19.860 --> 00:05:21.540 align:middle line:84%
That intentionality
is referenced

00:05:21.540 --> 00:05:23.780 align:middle line:84%
in every indigenous
tradition that I

00:05:23.780 --> 00:05:26.130 align:middle line:84%
have ever, ever
studied, including

00:05:26.130 --> 00:05:28.350 align:middle line:90%
ancient Sumerian civilization.

00:05:28.350 --> 00:05:30.690 align:middle line:84%
Every indigenous
tradition talks about us

00:05:30.690 --> 00:05:33.420 align:middle line:84%
being the product of
an intentional act

00:05:33.420 --> 00:05:37.320 align:middle line:84%
from an intelligent
source of life

00:05:37.320 --> 00:05:42.050 align:middle line:84%
that originates from some
other part of the universe,

00:05:42.050 --> 00:05:45.480 align:middle line:84%
and is not necessarily
native to this world.

00:05:45.480 --> 00:05:48.820 align:middle line:84%
And also suggests
that we are hybrids,

00:05:48.820 --> 00:05:54.060 align:middle line:84%
because those traditions tell
us that, while we are made

00:05:54.060 --> 00:05:56.310 align:middle line:84%
of the dust of the Earth,
as the terms they use,

00:05:56.310 --> 00:05:58.320 align:middle line:84%
or the minerals of
the Earth, we're also

00:05:58.320 --> 00:06:02.820 align:middle line:84%
infused with qualities from
these higher intelligences.

00:06:02.820 --> 00:06:05.610 align:middle line:84%
And if we're going to call
those the extraterrestrials--

00:06:05.610 --> 00:06:07.860 align:middle line:84%
I'm not even really sure
what that term means anymore.

00:06:07.860 --> 00:06:11.790 align:middle line:84%
Just means not from Earth,
as we know it today.

00:06:11.790 --> 00:06:13.530 align:middle line:84%
Maybe they have been
here in the past.

00:06:13.530 --> 00:06:14.940 align:middle line:90%
I don't know.

00:06:14.940 --> 00:06:22.410 align:middle line:84%
So it implies the engineering
of DNA to give us our humanness,

00:06:22.410 --> 00:06:25.230 align:middle line:84%
and that that was,
in fact, facilitated

00:06:25.230 --> 00:06:29.014 align:middle line:84%
by something other than
random acts of evolution.

00:06:29.014 --> 00:06:30.680 align:middle line:84%
That makes sense if
I answered that way?

00:06:30.680 --> 00:06:31.290 align:middle line:90%
>> It does, and I think--

00:06:31.290 --> 00:06:32.990 align:middle line:84%
>> It's a big question,
and I want to honor it.

00:06:32.990 --> 00:06:34.781 align:middle line:84%
But I also know that
we're limited on time,

00:06:34.781 --> 00:06:36.240 align:middle line:90%
and I want to do my best here.

00:06:36.240 --> 00:06:37.040 align:middle line:90%
>> We are.

00:06:37.040 --> 00:06:41.184 align:middle line:84%
So maybe this question from
Cliff might be a good one.

00:06:41.184 --> 00:06:43.350 align:middle line:84%
He says, how old do you
think the Earth actually is,

00:06:43.350 --> 00:06:45.020 align:middle line:84%
and when do you think
the human was created?

00:06:45.020 --> 00:06:45.940 align:middle line:90%
>> OK, perfect.

00:06:45.940 --> 00:06:49.379 align:middle line:84%
We know, as I mentioned,
geologically, I

00:06:49.379 --> 00:06:51.420 align:middle line:84%
think we've got a pretty
good date on the Earth--

00:06:51.420 --> 00:06:55.470 align:middle line:90%
4.5 billion years for the Earth.

00:06:55.470 --> 00:07:01.260 align:middle line:84%
Humankind, what are called
anatomically modern humans,

00:07:01.260 --> 00:07:03.150 align:middle line:90%
showed up 200,000 years ago.

00:07:03.150 --> 00:07:05.760 align:middle line:84%
When I was in school
back in the '50s, '60s,

00:07:05.760 --> 00:07:07.710 align:middle line:84%
they were called
Cro-Magnon, and we

00:07:07.710 --> 00:07:10.290 align:middle line:84%
were taught that it was
some kind of a caveman.

00:07:10.290 --> 00:07:12.330 align:middle line:90%
Now, we know that Cro-Magnon--

00:07:12.330 --> 00:07:14.550 align:middle line:84%
they're able--
this is so amazing.

00:07:14.550 --> 00:07:18.917 align:middle line:84%
They're able to pull the
DNA from fossilized remains,

00:07:18.917 --> 00:07:20.250 align:middle line:90%
the bone marrow of these beings.

00:07:20.250 --> 00:07:22.020 align:middle line:90%
It's like "Jurassic Park" stuff.

00:07:22.020 --> 00:07:25.080 align:middle line:84%
They can actually pull
the DNA out of the fossils

00:07:25.080 --> 00:07:27.880 align:middle line:84%
and build the genome, and what
they know is that they are us,

00:07:27.880 --> 00:07:28.680 align:middle line:90%
and we are them.

00:07:28.680 --> 00:07:29.490 align:middle line:90%
We haven't changed.

00:07:29.490 --> 00:07:32.970 align:middle line:84%
So we appeared-- anatomically
modern humans appeared

00:07:32.970 --> 00:07:34.620 align:middle line:84%
200,000 years ago,
but there doesn't

00:07:34.620 --> 00:07:37.801 align:middle line:84%
appear to be an evolutionary
path that led to us.

00:07:37.801 --> 00:07:40.050 align:middle line:84%
So like, boom, we showed
that, and that's the mystery.

00:07:40.050 --> 00:07:41.760 align:middle line:90%
How can that happen?

00:07:41.760 --> 00:07:45.120 align:middle line:84%
The genetic engineering now
is telling us how it happened.

00:07:45.120 --> 00:07:47.250 align:middle line:84%
It cannot tell us
why it happened.

00:07:47.250 --> 00:07:50.640 align:middle line:84%
>> So we do know that we
were created with lots

00:07:50.640 --> 00:07:55.590 align:middle line:84%
of capabilities, and one,
going back a long time ago,

00:07:55.590 --> 00:07:56.890 align:middle line:90%
pyramid technology.

00:07:56.890 --> 00:07:59.040 align:middle line:84%
So this is a question
that I actually submitted,

00:07:59.040 --> 00:08:02.100 align:middle line:84%
and maybe this is a good
way to talk about this.

00:08:02.100 --> 00:08:06.360 align:middle line:84%
But we know that sound
healing, sound technology,

00:08:06.360 --> 00:08:07.170 align:middle line:90%
helped create--

00:08:07.170 --> 00:08:10.140 align:middle line:84%
or possibly create the
huge pyramids that we see.

00:08:10.140 --> 00:08:14.340 align:middle line:84%
Inside those pyramids, there's
a lot of healing capabilities

00:08:14.340 --> 00:08:15.450 align:middle line:90%
that have been proven out.

00:08:15.450 --> 00:08:19.440 align:middle line:84%
So the big question is, we have
this great knowledge, so one,

00:08:19.440 --> 00:08:21.300 align:middle line:84%
is anyone doing
anything about it

00:08:21.300 --> 00:08:23.520 align:middle line:84%
to make this a reality for
the general population,

00:08:23.520 --> 00:08:26.250 align:middle line:84%
like access to healing
through pyramid

00:08:26.250 --> 00:08:28.110 align:middle line:90%
technology or sound healing?

00:08:28.110 --> 00:08:31.050 align:middle line:84%
And then just why don't
you think more people

00:08:31.050 --> 00:08:32.580 align:middle line:90%
are doing things like this?

00:08:32.580 --> 00:08:35.580 align:middle line:84%
>> To answer the question, I
have to go back to the way it

00:08:35.580 --> 00:08:40.380 align:middle line:84%
was phrased, in terms of
the way pyramids were built.

00:08:40.380 --> 00:08:42.980 align:middle line:84%
As a scientist, I have
to say, scientifically,

00:08:42.980 --> 00:08:46.080 align:middle line:84%
there's no evidence suggesting
the pyramids were built using

00:08:46.080 --> 00:08:47.370 align:middle line:90%
any kind of sound technology.

00:08:47.370 --> 00:08:51.030 align:middle line:84%
It's a theory that's out there,
and it certainly is possible,

00:08:51.030 --> 00:08:53.400 align:middle line:84%
but the evidence
doesn't support it.

00:08:53.400 --> 00:08:55.890 align:middle line:10%
When I was in Egypt in
the 1980s, for example,

00:08:55.890 --> 00:08:58.590 align:middle line:10%
they were doing core samples
into the building blocks

00:08:58.590 --> 00:09:02.190 align:middle line:10%
of the pyramid because they
thought that the pyramid was

00:09:02.190 --> 00:09:04.530 align:middle line:10%
built of limestone that
they carved out of the cliff

00:09:04.530 --> 00:09:07.410 align:middle line:10%
and moved and put in place.

00:09:07.410 --> 00:09:09.570 align:middle line:84%
The core samples told
them that's not true,

00:09:09.570 --> 00:09:11.670 align:middle line:84%
that the Great
Pyramid, for example,

00:09:11.670 --> 00:09:13.800 align:middle line:84%
when they took those
core samples, if it

00:09:13.800 --> 00:09:17.280 align:middle line:84%
were a naturally occurring
rock, it would have layers.

00:09:17.280 --> 00:09:20.670 align:middle line:84%
It would have fossilized
seashells if it's limestone.

00:09:20.670 --> 00:09:24.120 align:middle line:84%
And what they found was
that it wasn't layered.

00:09:24.120 --> 00:09:26.910 align:middle line:90%
It was completely homogeneous.

00:09:26.910 --> 00:09:30.240 align:middle line:84%
There were air bubbles
and traces of human hair

00:09:30.240 --> 00:09:32.640 align:middle line:90%
that were in the rock.

00:09:32.640 --> 00:09:34.467 align:middle line:84%
What scientists
now believe, those

00:09:34.467 --> 00:09:36.300 align:middle line:84%
that were doing the
study, is that that rock

00:09:36.300 --> 00:09:37.860 align:middle line:90%
is an artificial stone.

00:09:37.860 --> 00:09:41.770 align:middle line:84%
It's pulverized of natural
rock, mixed with an epoxy,

00:09:41.770 --> 00:09:42.570 align:middle line:90%
and poured.

00:09:42.570 --> 00:09:45.420 align:middle line:84%
The stones were poured
in place to give them

00:09:45.420 --> 00:09:48.480 align:middle line:84%
the high tolerances,
the close fit.

00:09:48.480 --> 00:09:50.790 align:middle line:84%
That way you don't have to
get the stone-- you pour it

00:09:50.790 --> 00:09:51.590 align:middle line:90%
in place.

00:09:51.590 --> 00:09:54.150 align:middle line:84%
You don't have to carry it up,
so I just want to say that.

00:09:54.150 --> 00:09:57.420 align:middle line:84%
There are healing properties
that are known within pyramids,

00:09:57.420 --> 00:10:02.340 align:middle line:84%
and that technology is
embraced in some capacities

00:10:02.340 --> 00:10:03.580 align:middle line:90%
to those that are open to it.

00:10:03.580 --> 00:10:04.380 align:middle line:90%
Others are not.

00:10:04.380 --> 00:10:07.380 align:middle line:84%
We may never see it
openly in our society

00:10:07.380 --> 00:10:10.830 align:middle line:84%
because of what we've
been taught about physics

00:10:10.830 --> 00:10:11.970 align:middle line:90%
and the way things work.

00:10:11.970 --> 00:10:15.720 align:middle line:84%
So there are commercial
applications using pyramid

00:10:15.720 --> 00:10:18.210 align:middle line:90%
technology, and some of those--

00:10:18.210 --> 00:10:21.300 align:middle line:84%
for example, in some
northern European countries,

00:10:21.300 --> 00:10:23.310 align:middle line:84%
they're using pyramid
shaped packages

00:10:23.310 --> 00:10:27.180 align:middle line:84%
to package the yogurt because
the yogurt doesn't go bad.

00:10:27.180 --> 00:10:29.350 align:middle line:10%
They're using the pyramid--

00:10:29.350 --> 00:10:32.760 align:middle line:10%
they call them chargers
for razor blades

00:10:32.760 --> 00:10:34.290 align:middle line:10%
because the razor
blades won't dull

00:10:34.290 --> 00:10:36.960 align:middle line:10%
when they're placed under these
after they're used each day.

00:10:36.960 --> 00:10:40.330 align:middle line:84%
So those-- the principles
are being incorporated

00:10:40.330 --> 00:10:42.580 align:middle line:90%
some commercial ways.

00:10:42.580 --> 00:10:45.270 align:middle line:84%
Whether or not we ever live in
a pyramid based society or not,

00:10:45.270 --> 00:10:48.030 align:middle line:84%
I don't-- personally, I don't
see that happening right now

00:10:48.030 --> 00:10:52.320 align:middle line:84%
because I think society doesn't
see a need for what is offered

00:10:52.320 --> 00:10:53.640 align:middle line:90%
in that technology.

00:10:53.640 --> 00:10:57.270 align:middle line:10%
>> Melinda Sweet wants to
address the Flat Earth theory.

00:10:57.270 --> 00:10:58.740 align:middle line:84%
We talked a little
bit about that

00:10:58.740 --> 00:11:01.290 align:middle line:84%
in season two episode
one of "Buzzsaw."

00:11:01.290 --> 00:11:03.540 align:middle line:84%
We asked Billy Carson
his take on that.

00:11:03.540 --> 00:11:05.220 align:middle line:84%
But Melinda wants
to know as well,

00:11:05.220 --> 00:11:09.180 align:middle line:84%
and that the reason is because
the ancient cosmologies have

00:11:09.180 --> 00:11:10.680 align:middle line:84%
indicated that the
world is a plain.

00:11:10.680 --> 00:11:13.260 align:middle line:90%
So can you address that?

00:11:13.260 --> 00:11:14.130 align:middle line:90%
>> I can address it.

00:11:14.130 --> 00:11:16.290 align:middle line:90%
I'm a degreed geologist.

00:11:16.290 --> 00:11:19.770 align:middle line:84%
I have looked into this to
satisfy my own curiosity.

00:11:19.770 --> 00:11:22.440 align:middle line:84%
So let me share with our viewers
what I have found, personally,

00:11:22.440 --> 00:11:23.981 align:middle line:84%
and then they can
do with it whatever

00:11:23.981 --> 00:11:26.790 align:middle line:90%
they would like to do with it.

00:11:26.790 --> 00:11:30.960 align:middle line:84%
I believe that the
evidence overwhelmingly

00:11:30.960 --> 00:11:35.510 align:middle line:84%
supports a curved Earth,
a spherical Earth.

00:11:35.510 --> 00:11:37.952 align:middle line:84%
I've talked to astronauts
that have been in space,

00:11:37.952 --> 00:11:39.660 align:middle line:84%
and their experience
of what they've seen

00:11:39.660 --> 00:11:43.620 align:middle line:84%
and what they have photographed,
so that's their experience.

00:11:43.620 --> 00:11:46.350 align:middle line:84%
And I said, well, OK, I
want my own experience,

00:11:46.350 --> 00:11:48.480 align:middle line:90%
so I've done my own experiments.

00:11:48.480 --> 00:11:53.430 align:middle line:84%
If we had a Flat Earth, I think
the phenomenon of the Eclipse

00:11:53.430 --> 00:11:55.500 align:middle line:84%
would not function
the way that it does.

00:11:55.500 --> 00:11:57.660 align:middle line:84%
When we see an eclipse,
the shadow of the Earth

00:11:57.660 --> 00:11:59.670 align:middle line:90%
on the moon, it's a sphere.

00:11:59.670 --> 00:12:00.670 align:middle line:90%
It's a circle.

00:12:00.670 --> 00:12:01.470 align:middle line:84%
Well, I have to
say it's a circle.

00:12:01.470 --> 00:12:03.380 align:middle line:84%
We don't know a sphere,
but it is a circle.

00:12:03.380 --> 00:12:05.340 align:middle line:90%
It's not flat.

00:12:05.340 --> 00:12:08.430 align:middle line:84%
When an experiment that
I've done-- if I take two

00:12:08.430 --> 00:12:12.000 align:middle line:84%
sticks, and I put
them in the ground

00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:14.640 align:middle line:84%
the shadow is going to
be cast exactly the same,

00:12:14.640 --> 00:12:21.510 align:middle line:84%
and if we were living
on a Flat Earth,

00:12:21.510 --> 00:12:23.550 align:middle line:90%
the shadows would be different.

00:12:23.550 --> 00:12:25.800 align:middle line:84%
When I'm at the beach,
and I see a ship coming

00:12:25.800 --> 00:12:29.940 align:middle line:84%
to me on the horizon, if this
was a Flat Earth it would start

00:12:29.940 --> 00:12:34.200 align:middle line:84%
is a tiny speck in the distance,
and I would see the full ship,

00:12:34.200 --> 00:12:36.420 align:middle line:84%
and it would simply become
larger as it came to me.

00:12:36.420 --> 00:12:38.634 align:middle line:84%
The reality of what
happens is when

00:12:38.634 --> 00:12:40.050 align:middle line:84%
you see that ship
in the distance,

00:12:40.050 --> 00:12:41.560 align:middle line:84%
first you see the
top of the ship,

00:12:41.560 --> 00:12:42.620 align:middle line:84%
and as it gets a
little closer, you

00:12:42.620 --> 00:12:44.078 align:middle line:84%
see a little more
and a little more

00:12:44.078 --> 00:12:48.300 align:middle line:84%
because it is coming up over
a spherical geometry rather

00:12:48.300 --> 00:12:50.020 align:middle line:90%
than a flat geometry.

00:12:50.020 --> 00:12:52.680 align:middle line:84%
I minored mathematics
in school, and I

00:12:52.680 --> 00:12:59.070 align:middle line:84%
think that the mathematics
and the geometry that we use,

00:12:59.070 --> 00:13:01.740 align:middle line:84%
that put us on
the moon, and that

00:13:01.740 --> 00:13:05.520 align:middle line:84%
has worked well enough to send
our probes to other planets,

00:13:05.520 --> 00:13:08.670 align:middle line:84%
and even land a probe
on a moving asteroid

00:13:08.670 --> 00:13:12.840 align:middle line:84%
and Earth, that is all
based on spherical geometry

00:13:12.840 --> 00:13:15.180 align:middle line:84%
of a spherical planet,
and the trajectories

00:13:15.180 --> 00:13:16.320 align:middle line:90%
of other spherical planets.

00:13:16.320 --> 00:13:18.660 align:middle line:84%
That math would not work
if this were a Flat Earth.

00:13:18.660 --> 00:13:23.670 align:middle line:84%
So my personal feeling is, when
the ancients talked about it,

00:13:23.670 --> 00:13:25.712 align:middle line:84%
I don't think they
mean it literally.

00:13:25.712 --> 00:13:27.420 align:middle line:84%
They did talk about
it, but I don't think

00:13:27.420 --> 00:13:29.850 align:middle line:90%
it was in a literal sense.

00:13:29.850 --> 00:13:32.790 align:middle line:84%
So that's what I have to
say to honor my audience

00:13:32.790 --> 00:13:34.650 align:middle line:84%
and my own experience
as a scientist.

00:13:34.650 --> 00:13:36.432 align:middle line:84%
And I'm open to
new possibilities,

00:13:36.432 --> 00:13:38.640 align:middle line:84%
and if somebody could show
me the evidence otherwise,

00:13:38.640 --> 00:13:40.480 align:middle line:90%
I'm certainly open to that.

00:13:40.480 --> 00:13:42.240 align:middle line:90%
>> Thank you.

00:13:42.240 --> 00:13:43.840 align:middle line:84%
>> Try your own
experiments, people.

00:13:43.840 --> 00:13:46.780 align:middle line:84%
Go out and do your own
experiments and see.

00:13:46.780 --> 00:13:50.340 align:middle line:84%
>> Debi Brown wants to know, is
it true that alien beings live

00:13:50.340 --> 00:13:53.100 align:middle line:84%
inside the Earth, which
supposedly has its own sun

00:13:53.100 --> 00:13:55.350 align:middle line:84%
and water like another
world inside the Earth?

00:13:55.350 --> 00:13:57.420 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, this is the
Hollow Earth theory.

00:13:57.420 --> 00:13:59.730 align:middle line:90%
You know, I studied this.

00:13:59.730 --> 00:14:01.922 align:middle line:84%
I saw it first
proposed in the 19--

00:14:01.922 --> 00:14:04.690 align:middle line:84%
well, early part of
the 20th Century.

00:14:04.690 --> 00:14:06.570 align:middle line:84%
And I studied this back
in the '60s and '70s,

00:14:06.570 --> 00:14:08.940 align:middle line:84%
and I've continued
to study because I

00:14:08.940 --> 00:14:11.640 align:middle line:90%
am open to all possibilities.

00:14:11.640 --> 00:14:13.260 align:middle line:84%
As a geologist--
it's interesting,

00:14:13.260 --> 00:14:15.420 align:middle line:84%
my background is in
geology because it's

00:14:15.420 --> 00:14:17.130 align:middle line:84%
given me the tools
to answer, you know,

00:14:17.130 --> 00:14:19.950 align:middle line:90%
a lot of these questions.

00:14:19.950 --> 00:14:24.450 align:middle line:84%
I worked in seismic geology
right out of college,

00:14:24.450 --> 00:14:27.391 align:middle line:84%
and seismic geology is
where we send vibration

00:14:27.391 --> 00:14:29.265 align:middle line:84%
into the Earth in a
number of different ways.

00:14:29.265 --> 00:14:33.330 align:middle line:84%
We can do it with a device
that hits the Earth very hard

00:14:33.330 --> 00:14:35.970 align:middle line:84%
and sends waves down, and we
can do it with small explosions.

00:14:35.970 --> 00:14:39.850 align:middle line:84%
We can do it with different
kinds of radio waves.

00:14:39.850 --> 00:14:44.280 align:middle line:84%
But the point is that the waves
travel at different speeds

00:14:44.280 --> 00:14:46.800 align:middle line:84%
through different
media, and what

00:14:46.800 --> 00:14:51.390 align:middle line:84%
we find is that there is
resistance to the waves

00:14:51.390 --> 00:14:52.870 align:middle line:90%
all the way down to the core.

00:14:52.870 --> 00:14:54.980 align:middle line:84%
So they travel through
the crust of the Earth,

00:14:54.980 --> 00:14:57.570 align:middle line:84%
the thickest part, at
one speed, and they try--

00:14:57.570 --> 00:14:59.550 align:middle line:84%
and then they bounce
back, and they

00:14:59.550 --> 00:15:01.530 align:middle line:84%
travel through the mantle
at a different speed

00:15:01.530 --> 00:15:03.840 align:middle line:84%
because it is more molten,
and then they bounce back.

00:15:03.840 --> 00:15:06.330 align:middle line:84%
And then there's an outer
core, and then there

00:15:06.330 --> 00:15:07.500 align:middle line:90%
is an inner core.

00:15:07.500 --> 00:15:10.590 align:middle line:84%
They believe it's solid
iron nickel, probably

00:15:10.590 --> 00:15:13.050 align:middle line:84%
is what they're
looking at right now,

00:15:13.050 --> 00:15:15.270 align:middle line:84%
that allows the magnetic
field of the Earth.

00:15:15.270 --> 00:15:17.400 align:middle line:84%
If the Earth were
hollow, we would

00:15:17.400 --> 00:15:20.024 align:middle line:90%
have space where those waves--

00:15:20.024 --> 00:15:20.940 align:middle line:90%
there's no resistance.

00:15:20.940 --> 00:15:22.940 align:middle line:84%
They'd travel so fast,
and they would come back,

00:15:22.940 --> 00:15:24.880 align:middle line:84%
and then they
don't tell us that.

00:15:24.880 --> 00:15:28.530 align:middle line:84%
Now, having said that, where
I think this idea comes from--

00:15:28.530 --> 00:15:31.140 align:middle line:84%
the crust is the thickest
part of the earth,

00:15:31.140 --> 00:15:36.750 align:middle line:84%
and I think the crust is
riddled with catacombs, tunnels,

00:15:36.750 --> 00:15:39.450 align:middle line:84%
artificial tunnels that were
created from lava tubes,

00:15:39.450 --> 00:15:43.800 align:middle line:84%
and things like that, that
have been used in ancient times

00:15:43.800 --> 00:15:44.640 align:middle line:90%
because they exist.

00:15:44.640 --> 00:15:46.890 align:middle line:84%
If they're there,
why not use them?

00:15:46.890 --> 00:15:51.480 align:middle line:84%
Almost universally, the creation
stories, native peoples,

00:15:51.480 --> 00:15:54.960 align:middle line:84%
talk about emerging from
underneath the Earth

00:15:54.960 --> 00:15:56.940 align:middle line:84%
after the times
of cataclysm where

00:15:56.940 --> 00:16:01.680 align:middle line:84%
they were safe, to emerge in
the new world of the surface.

00:16:01.680 --> 00:16:04.297 align:middle line:84%
And I've always
sensed, from talking

00:16:04.297 --> 00:16:05.880 align:middle line:84%
to my indigenous
friends, that they're

00:16:05.880 --> 00:16:09.600 align:middle line:84%
talking about preexisting
caverns that can go very, very

00:16:09.600 --> 00:16:11.500 align:middle line:84%
deep, but it's not
a hollow Earth,

00:16:11.500 --> 00:16:15.630 align:middle line:84%
and there's not another sun
per se living within the Earth.

00:16:15.630 --> 00:16:18.660 align:middle line:84%
Is it possible that
beings from the past

00:16:18.660 --> 00:16:22.470 align:middle line:84%
or beings from other worlds
could occupy those to have--

00:16:22.470 --> 00:16:23.760 align:middle line:90%
so they're not so obvious now?

00:16:23.760 --> 00:16:25.372 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely, I think.

00:16:25.372 --> 00:16:27.330 align:middle line:84%
I don't personally have
any experience with it.

00:16:27.330 --> 00:16:30.150 align:middle line:84%
I wouldn't be surprised
to find that that's true,

00:16:30.150 --> 00:16:33.060 align:middle line:84%
or to find that some of the
life forms of the past that we

00:16:33.060 --> 00:16:34.800 align:middle line:84%
thought were extinct
actually still exist

00:16:34.800 --> 00:16:35.799 align:middle line:90%
in some of these places.

00:16:35.799 --> 00:16:37.440 align:middle line:84%
They show up every
once in a while,

00:16:37.440 --> 00:16:39.900 align:middle line:84%
and you say, how could they
have hidden for all this time?

00:16:39.900 --> 00:16:42.180 align:middle line:90%
Bigfoot is a perfect example.

00:16:42.180 --> 00:16:44.310 align:middle line:84%
The high deserts of northern
New Mexico, my home,

00:16:44.310 --> 00:16:48.150 align:middle line:84%
are littered with these
underground caverns that

00:16:48.150 --> 00:16:49.740 align:middle line:84%
have been, and
continue to be, used

00:16:49.740 --> 00:16:52.539 align:middle line:84%
for a number of
different purposes.

00:16:52.539 --> 00:16:55.080 align:middle line:84%
So I think that might be where
the Hollow Earth come-- not so

00:16:55.080 --> 00:17:01.350 align:middle line:84%
much a hollow Earth per se,
but a tunneled crust that

00:17:01.350 --> 00:17:03.890 align:middle line:84%
goes very deep, that could
very well appear to be hollow,

00:17:03.890 --> 00:17:04.970 align:middle line:90%
a hollow Earth.

00:17:04.970 --> 00:17:05.480 align:middle line:90%
Does that makes sense?

00:17:05.480 --> 00:17:06.310 align:middle line:90%
Have I-- is that a good--

00:17:06.310 --> 00:17:08.559 align:middle line:84%
>> No, it does-- yeah,
absolutely, that was a great,

00:17:08.559 --> 00:17:09.359 align:middle line:90%
great explanation.

00:17:09.359 --> 00:17:10.159 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:17:10.159 --> 00:17:12.822 align:middle line:84%
>> If the Earth were hollow,
those waves would react

00:17:12.822 --> 00:17:14.280 align:middle line:84%
differently when
they come back up,

00:17:14.280 --> 00:17:18.540 align:middle line:84%
and I'm all about empirical
science and being honest with

00:17:18.540 --> 00:17:19.690 align:middle line:90%
myself.

00:17:19.690 --> 00:17:23.197 align:middle line:84%
>> Let's talk about the
vibrational frequencies.

00:17:23.197 --> 00:17:24.780 align:middle line:10%
Christopher Wolf
wants to know, do you

00:17:24.780 --> 00:17:28.770 align:middle line:10%
consider progression of time
as a change in vibration?

00:17:28.770 --> 00:17:31.130 align:middle line:10%
Is the ancient past
or distant future

00:17:31.130 --> 00:17:34.400 align:middle line:10%
just a perceptual
change in frequency?

00:17:34.400 --> 00:17:37.260 align:middle line:84%
>> So it's a really
good question.

00:17:37.260 --> 00:17:39.030 align:middle line:84%
A very famous
scientist once said,

00:17:39.030 --> 00:17:41.040 align:middle line:84%
time is what happens
to keep everything

00:17:41.040 --> 00:17:44.240 align:middle line:84%
from running together,
and if you think about it,

00:17:44.240 --> 00:17:46.950 align:middle line:90%
I think it makes a lot of sense.

00:17:46.950 --> 00:17:49.950 align:middle line:84%
Time, I believe, is
fractal, and what I

00:17:49.950 --> 00:17:52.170 align:middle line:84%
mean by that is the
experiences that we

00:17:52.170 --> 00:17:56.820 align:middle line:84%
have in one point in our
lives repeat on a rhythmic,

00:17:56.820 --> 00:18:00.750 align:middle line:84%
a cyclic basis, again
to a greater degree,

00:18:00.750 --> 00:18:02.000 align:middle line:90%
and again to a greater degree.

00:18:02.000 --> 00:18:06.250 align:middle line:84%
So rather than being linear,
I think time is cyclic itself,

00:18:06.250 --> 00:18:07.980 align:middle line:84%
and I think our
perception of time

00:18:07.980 --> 00:18:11.510 align:middle line:84%
is directly linked to
vibration and to emotion.

00:18:11.510 --> 00:18:16.890 align:middle line:84%
It's our emotional attachment to
the events as they're occurring

00:18:16.890 --> 00:18:22.170 align:middle line:84%
and the ability of our emotions
to link us into a quantum

00:18:22.170 --> 00:18:24.030 align:middle line:90%
field in a very precise way.

00:18:24.030 --> 00:18:26.490 align:middle line:84%
We are both quantum
and mechanistic beings.

00:18:26.490 --> 00:18:28.740 align:middle line:84%
Time is one of the
greatest mysteries.

00:18:28.740 --> 00:18:31.740 align:middle line:84%
And human emotion,
that's been discounted

00:18:31.740 --> 00:18:33.806 align:middle line:84%
by modern science
in many respects,

00:18:33.806 --> 00:18:35.430 align:middle line:84%
is actually, in the
ancient traditions,

00:18:35.430 --> 00:18:37.860 align:middle line:84%
is the key to
mastering this quantum

00:18:37.860 --> 00:18:39.652 align:middle line:84%
world, the key to
mastering time travel,

00:18:39.652 --> 00:18:40.860 align:middle line:90%
the key to mastering healing.

00:18:40.860 --> 00:18:41.860 align:middle line:90%
It's all about emotions.

00:18:41.860 --> 00:18:42.659 align:middle line:90%
>> Interesting.

00:18:42.659 --> 00:18:45.480 align:middle line:84%
>> And no other form of life
has the ability to trigger

00:18:45.480 --> 00:18:49.450 align:middle line:84%
the emotions intentionally
at will the way that we do

00:18:49.450 --> 00:18:50.250 align:middle line:90%
as humans.

00:18:50.250 --> 00:18:51.960 align:middle line:84%
I'm not saying they
don't have them,

00:18:51.960 --> 00:18:54.660 align:middle line:84%
but we have the ability
to bring them into play

00:18:54.660 --> 00:18:56.752 align:middle line:84%
when we feel they are
appropriate in ways

00:18:56.752 --> 00:18:57.960 align:middle line:90%
that we feel are appropriate.

00:18:57.960 --> 00:19:01.170 align:middle line:84%
No other form of life, to
the best of my knowledge,

00:19:01.170 --> 00:19:03.510 align:middle line:84%
gets up in the morning
and says, today, you know,

00:19:03.510 --> 00:19:06.180 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to trigger
this kind of emotion

00:19:06.180 --> 00:19:09.920 align:middle line:84%
or this kind of healing
in my body in this moment.

00:19:09.920 --> 00:19:12.980 align:middle line:10%
>> Mandy Sims wants to know
if you've discovered anything

00:19:12.980 --> 00:19:18.080 align:middle line:10%
recently, after the show,
and anything that proves that

00:19:18.080 --> 00:19:20.990 align:middle line:10%
humans have been on this planet
longer than scientifically

00:19:20.990 --> 00:19:21.920 align:middle line:10%
proven?

00:19:21.920 --> 00:19:23.795 align:middle line:10%
>> You know, after the
show was the election,

00:19:23.795 --> 00:19:27.080 align:middle line:10%
and everything just kind
of went crazy after that.

00:19:27.080 --> 00:19:33.740 align:middle line:84%
No, I-- I believe that the more
discoveries that are revealed--

00:19:33.740 --> 00:19:34.890 align:middle line:90%
and I'm a scholar.

00:19:34.890 --> 00:19:35.690 align:middle line:90%
I'm a researcher.

00:19:35.690 --> 00:19:37.190 align:middle line:84%
I spend a tremendous
amount of time

00:19:37.190 --> 00:19:38.360 align:middle line:90%
researching new discoveries.

00:19:38.360 --> 00:19:41.390 align:middle line:84%
I belong to scientific
organizations,

00:19:41.390 --> 00:19:44.510 align:middle line:84%
the American Association for the
Advancement of Science, AAAS.

00:19:44.510 --> 00:19:49.050 align:middle line:84%
I'm still active in some of
the geologic organizations

00:19:49.050 --> 00:19:52.610 align:middle line:84%
that I've participated
with in the past.

00:19:52.610 --> 00:19:53.870 align:middle line:90%
It's all about a perspective.

00:19:53.870 --> 00:19:56.660 align:middle line:84%
The discoveries are
there, but the discoveries

00:19:56.660 --> 00:19:58.055 align:middle line:90%
are not given context.

00:19:58.055 --> 00:19:59.930 align:middle line:84%
So scientists simply--
they make a discovery,

00:19:59.930 --> 00:20:01.013 align:middle line:90%
and they put it out there.

00:20:01.013 --> 00:20:04.280 align:middle line:84%
So for example, scientists
now are in agreement

00:20:04.280 --> 00:20:06.500 align:middle line:84%
that human chromosome
number two is

00:20:06.500 --> 00:20:11.360 align:middle line:84%
the result of an ancient fusion
of preexisting chromosomes.

00:20:11.360 --> 00:20:14.000 align:middle line:90%
That is scientifically accepted.

00:20:14.000 --> 00:20:16.220 align:middle line:84%
They're stuck because
there's no context for what

00:20:16.220 --> 00:20:17.020 align:middle line:90%
to do with that.

00:20:17.020 --> 00:20:19.050 align:middle line:84%
They say, well, what
do we do with that?

00:20:19.050 --> 00:20:22.250 align:middle line:84%
Well, there's another discovery
in chromosome number seven.

00:20:22.250 --> 00:20:27.920 align:middle line:84%
There's a gene called the
FOXP2, F-O-X P2, chromosome.

00:20:27.920 --> 00:20:30.560 align:middle line:84%
Other primates have
this chromosome,

00:20:30.560 --> 00:20:32.600 align:middle line:84%
and they've had it
for 75 million years.

00:20:32.600 --> 00:20:34.340 align:middle line:90%
It's never changed.

00:20:34.340 --> 00:20:37.460 align:middle line:84%
200,000 years ago,
precisely the time

00:20:37.460 --> 00:20:42.830 align:middle line:84%
when humans, anatomically modern
humans appeared, that FOXP2--

00:20:42.830 --> 00:20:47.180 align:middle line:84%
two little letters were
shifted and gave us

00:20:47.180 --> 00:20:50.720 align:middle line:84%
the ability for complex
language and speech in a way

00:20:50.720 --> 00:20:52.640 align:middle line:90%
that no other form of life has.

00:20:52.640 --> 00:20:56.630 align:middle line:84%
The fact that it happened
precisely when humans emerged,

00:20:56.630 --> 00:20:58.690 align:middle line:84%
the fact that it's
never happened

00:20:58.690 --> 00:21:02.810 align:middle line:84%
in the ape family, the
precision and the intentionality

00:21:02.810 --> 00:21:05.450 align:middle line:84%
that it takes to make
that simple switch,

00:21:05.450 --> 00:21:08.330 align:middle line:84%
and the fact that it happened at
the same time human chromosome

00:21:08.330 --> 00:21:12.375 align:middle line:84%
number two is being fused,
to me are genetic evidence.

00:21:12.375 --> 00:21:15.710 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't say
that it did happen.

00:21:15.710 --> 00:21:18.440 align:middle line:84%
It lends to the
credibility, correlates

00:21:18.440 --> 00:21:20.090 align:middle line:90%
with the origin of humans.

00:21:20.090 --> 00:21:23.990 align:middle line:84%
It tells us that we, our
story, is not evolution.

00:21:23.990 --> 00:21:27.020 align:middle line:84%
There's much more to our
story than human evolution,

00:21:27.020 --> 00:21:29.930 align:middle line:84%
and when we can
embrace that fact,

00:21:29.930 --> 00:21:32.540 align:middle line:84%
then we can dedicate
our brilliant minds

00:21:32.540 --> 00:21:34.550 align:middle line:84%
of brilliant scientists,
men and women,

00:21:34.550 --> 00:21:37.850 align:middle line:84%
and the tremendous energy, and
the resources, and the funding,

00:21:37.850 --> 00:21:39.800 align:middle line:84%
and the backing of
the universities,

00:21:39.800 --> 00:21:42.590 align:middle line:84%
to revealing the new human story
rather than spinning our wheels

00:21:42.590 --> 00:21:47.120 align:middle line:84%
on a 150-year-old story that has
gotten us nowhere in 150 years

00:21:47.120 --> 00:21:49.537 align:middle line:84%
because the evidence has
led us to a dead end.

00:21:49.537 --> 00:21:51.620 align:middle line:84%
I talked about this a
little earlier on a podcast.

00:21:51.620 --> 00:21:52.940 align:middle line:90%
Here's the deal.

00:21:52.940 --> 00:21:56.670 align:middle line:84%
There's a huge
difference between taking

00:21:56.670 --> 00:22:00.450 align:middle line:84%
the new discoveries and
forcing them into a preexisting

00:22:00.450 --> 00:22:04.530 align:middle line:84%
theory like evolution, and
allowing the new discoveries

00:22:04.530 --> 00:22:07.680 align:middle line:84%
to lead to the story
that they tell,

00:22:07.680 --> 00:22:10.180 align:middle line:84%
and my proposal is
let's do just that.

00:22:10.180 --> 00:22:13.585 align:middle line:84%
Let's allow the new discoveries
to lead us to what--

00:22:13.585 --> 00:22:15.210 align:middle line:84%
and be honest with
ourselves about what

00:22:15.210 --> 00:22:18.870 align:middle line:84%
it's saying, rather
than fighting to hold on

00:22:18.870 --> 00:22:23.790 align:middle line:84%
to a story that has not
budged since it was proposed

00:22:23.790 --> 00:22:27.570 align:middle line:84%
in 1859 with Darwin's
theory of evolution,

00:22:27.570 --> 00:22:30.070 align:middle line:84%
because that story is
no longer serving us,

00:22:30.070 --> 00:22:31.590 align:middle line:84%
and the evidence
doesn't support it.

00:22:31.590 --> 00:22:33.339 align:middle line:84%
The physical evidence
and the DNA evidence

00:22:33.339 --> 00:22:34.242 align:middle line:90%
doesn't support it.

00:22:34.242 --> 00:22:36.450 align:middle line:84%
>> What do you think it'll
take to let that story go.

00:22:36.450 --> 00:22:37.491 align:middle line:90%
It's happening right now.

00:22:37.491 --> 00:22:41.520 align:middle line:84%
>> There-- the scientists
who are fighting,

00:22:41.520 --> 00:22:43.200 align:middle line:84%
struggling to hang
onto that story,

00:22:43.200 --> 00:22:46.320 align:middle line:84%
they're the ones you see in
prominent view in the media.

00:22:46.320 --> 00:22:49.950 align:middle line:84%
Behind the scenes, there is
a whole cadre of scientists.

00:22:49.950 --> 00:22:52.440 align:middle line:84%
They've signed-- there's a
petition that you can actually

00:22:52.440 --> 00:22:55.410 align:middle line:84%
view on the worldwide web,
that say we don't know what

00:22:55.410 --> 00:22:57.780 align:middle line:84%
did happen, but we know
evolution's not our story,

00:22:57.780 --> 00:23:00.900 align:middle line:84%
and we would like the
freedom to pursue this.

00:23:00.900 --> 00:23:04.260 align:middle line:84%
But think about this-- if you're
a tenured university professor,

00:23:04.260 --> 00:23:06.570 align:middle line:84%
if you're working
in a corporation,

00:23:06.570 --> 00:23:08.820 align:middle line:84%
or if you're a
university grad student,

00:23:08.820 --> 00:23:11.310 align:middle line:84%
and your funding
hinges on a corporation

00:23:11.310 --> 00:23:14.310 align:middle line:84%
who has a vested interest
in evolutionary theory

00:23:14.310 --> 00:23:16.800 align:middle line:84%
because it's making drugs
based on that, pharmaceuticals

00:23:16.800 --> 00:23:19.680 align:middle line:84%
or something, they
don't have the freedom

00:23:19.680 --> 00:23:21.720 align:middle line:90%
to move forward with this.

00:23:21.720 --> 00:23:24.780 align:middle line:84%
My reputation as a
scientist was shot

00:23:24.780 --> 00:23:27.480 align:middle line:84%
the minute I started talking
about spirituality and science.

00:23:27.480 --> 00:23:30.150 align:middle line:84%
The minute I combine
those two, you

00:23:30.150 --> 00:23:34.180 align:middle line:84%
know, in terms of publishing
credible scientific papers--

00:23:34.180 --> 00:23:34.980 align:middle line:90%
and it's not me.

00:23:34.980 --> 00:23:37.980 align:middle line:84%
Other authors have had
the same experience.

00:23:37.980 --> 00:23:41.790 align:middle line:84%
And I'm OK with that
because I would rather

00:23:41.790 --> 00:23:44.550 align:middle line:84%
research thoroughly
the new discoveries

00:23:44.550 --> 00:23:46.650 align:middle line:84%
and share them with a
broad general audience

00:23:46.650 --> 00:23:49.650 align:middle line:84%
to bring this information
forward quickly,

00:23:49.650 --> 00:23:54.640 align:middle line:84%
than publish to a
small selected audience

00:23:54.640 --> 00:23:57.310 align:middle line:84%
where the general public
never sees these things.

00:23:57.310 --> 00:23:58.110 align:middle line:90%
And it works.

00:23:58.110 --> 00:24:00.180 align:middle line:84%
Quick example-- in
2007, I wrote a book

00:24:00.180 --> 00:24:02.017 align:middle line:90%
called "The Divine Matrix."

00:24:02.017 --> 00:24:04.350 align:middle line:84%
It's about the field of energy
that connects all things.

00:24:04.350 --> 00:24:06.900 align:middle line:84%
It was considered
fringe in 2007.

00:24:06.900 --> 00:24:09.630 align:middle line:84%
There were bookstores that
put it on the occult bookshelf

00:24:09.630 --> 00:24:10.770 align:middle line:90%
in the back.

00:24:10.770 --> 00:24:15.870 align:middle line:84%
Today, that book is a textbook
in leading universities

00:24:15.870 --> 00:24:19.410 align:middle line:84%
in the physics department
that are teaching-- physics

00:24:19.410 --> 00:24:21.840 align:middle line:84%
and consciousness is what
they're teaching together,

00:24:21.840 --> 00:24:24.270 align:middle line:84%
and it's become a "New
York Times" bestseller,

00:24:24.270 --> 00:24:27.240 align:middle line:84%
and it's become a classic
in the physics text.

00:24:27.240 --> 00:24:29.850 align:middle line:90%
In, what was that, 12 years--

00:24:29.850 --> 00:24:31.950 align:middle line:84%
so in that short
a period of time,

00:24:31.950 --> 00:24:36.210 align:middle line:84%
by taking my case to the
mainstream with peer reviewed

00:24:36.210 --> 00:24:38.070 align:middle line:90%
science backed up--

00:24:38.070 --> 00:24:40.830 align:middle line:84%
I mean, rock solid science
from Princeton University

00:24:40.830 --> 00:24:44.435 align:middle line:84%
and leading science, it
just wasn't well-known.

00:24:44.435 --> 00:24:45.810 align:middle line:84%
It's now almost
common knowledge.

00:24:45.810 --> 00:24:47.910 align:middle line:84%
Everybody says, sure, we're
connected with the field.

00:24:47.910 --> 00:24:48.710 align:middle line:90%
Of course.

00:24:48.710 --> 00:24:51.460 align:middle line:84%
You know, the question is now,
what do we do with that field?

00:24:51.460 --> 00:24:53.127 align:middle line:84%
And that's where we
all get to chime in.

00:24:53.127 --> 00:24:55.460 align:middle line:84%
>> You mentioned a few of the
books that you've written.

00:24:55.460 --> 00:24:57.240 align:middle line:84%
Are you working on
any new books now?

00:24:57.240 --> 00:25:00.780 align:middle line:84%
>> Oh, I'm so happy that
you asked me that question.

00:25:00.780 --> 00:25:03.630 align:middle line:84%
I was working on a new
book that is now complete.

00:25:03.630 --> 00:25:06.360 align:middle line:10%
Two weeks ago, I pushed the
Send button on my computer,

00:25:06.360 --> 00:25:09.300 align:middle line:10%
and I sent the finished
manuscript for a new book

00:25:09.300 --> 00:25:12.240 align:middle line:10%
that is entitled
"Human by Design--

00:25:12.240 --> 00:25:15.460 align:middle line:10%
From Evolution by Chance to
Transformation by Choice,"

00:25:15.460 --> 00:25:16.830 align:middle line:10%
is the subtitle.

00:25:16.830 --> 00:25:18.615 align:middle line:84%
We've touched on
some of the topics.

00:25:18.615 --> 00:25:21.830 align:middle line:84%
The bottom line-- the book
is essentially two parts.

00:25:21.830 --> 00:25:24.030 align:middle line:84%
The first part of the
book is the science.

00:25:24.030 --> 00:25:26.806 align:middle line:84%
It's not technical,
and it's a lot of fun

00:25:26.806 --> 00:25:27.930 align:middle line:90%
to read the case histories.

00:25:27.930 --> 00:25:30.690 align:middle line:84%
But it's the science
that is showing us

00:25:30.690 --> 00:25:33.690 align:middle line:84%
that there's something
very precious and very

00:25:33.690 --> 00:25:37.740 align:middle line:84%
unique and very special about
us, our origin, and human life,

00:25:37.740 --> 00:25:40.530 align:middle line:84%
that we're more than
an accident of nature

00:25:40.530 --> 00:25:43.770 align:middle line:84%
or a fluke of biology,
some random atoms

00:25:43.770 --> 00:25:45.840 align:middle line:84%
happened to come together
just the right time

00:25:45.840 --> 00:25:48.000 align:middle line:84%
to create random molecules
that came together

00:25:48.000 --> 00:25:50.310 align:middle line:84%
just the right time under
just the right conditions

00:25:50.310 --> 00:25:53.310 align:middle line:84%
to create the human body,
and boom, here we are.

00:25:53.310 --> 00:25:55.080 align:middle line:84%
There's much more
to us than that.

00:25:55.080 --> 00:25:58.119 align:middle line:84%
The second part of the book
is, now that we know that,

00:25:58.119 --> 00:25:59.410 align:middle line:90%
what does it mean in our lives?

00:25:59.410 --> 00:26:01.620 align:middle line:84%
How do we apply the
extraordinary abilities--

00:26:01.620 --> 00:26:05.220 align:middle line:84%
and we touched on some of
these, deep intuition, empathy,

00:26:05.220 --> 00:26:10.350 align:middle line:84%
self-healing on demand, enhanced
immune system on demand,

00:26:10.350 --> 00:26:12.260 align:middle line:90%
resilience to change?

00:26:12.260 --> 00:26:14.727 align:middle line:84%
How do we-- direct access
to our subconscious

00:26:14.727 --> 00:26:15.810 align:middle line:90%
when we choose to have it.

00:26:15.810 --> 00:26:21.150 align:middle line:84%
All of these abilities
are made possible to us

00:26:21.150 --> 00:26:24.750 align:middle line:84%
through the fusion of the DNA
that makes us human, that gives

00:26:24.750 --> 00:26:26.040 align:middle line:90%
us our humanness.

00:26:26.040 --> 00:26:27.930 align:middle line:84%
Our ancestors knew
this, and they used many

00:26:27.930 --> 00:26:29.880 align:middle line:90%
of these in the mystical sense.

00:26:29.880 --> 00:26:33.210 align:middle line:84%
My belief is that
what we've always

00:26:33.210 --> 00:26:36.600 align:middle line:84%
called extraordinary abilities
are actually ordinary abilities

00:26:36.600 --> 00:26:39.920 align:middle line:84%
that we're meant to embrace
in our everyday lives,

00:26:39.920 --> 00:26:42.780 align:middle line:84%
to become better people,
to create a better world,

00:26:42.780 --> 00:26:44.050 align:middle line:90%
that have been forgotten.

00:26:44.050 --> 00:26:48.750 align:middle line:84%
And so my hope is,
first, by describing

00:26:48.750 --> 00:26:50.970 align:middle line:84%
how we have come
to be as we are,

00:26:50.970 --> 00:26:54.840 align:middle line:84%
we can embrace ourselves as
something very unique, very

00:26:54.840 --> 00:26:58.440 align:middle line:84%
precious, very special,
and open the door

00:26:58.440 --> 00:27:00.890 align:middle line:84%
to applying those
abilities in our lives.

00:27:00.890 --> 00:27:03.360 align:middle line:84%
And this has a
tremendous social context

00:27:03.360 --> 00:27:06.810 align:middle line:84%
because the book answers
the question who are we.

00:27:06.810 --> 00:27:09.900 align:middle line:84%
The way we answer that question,
the way our young people

00:27:09.900 --> 00:27:13.230 align:middle line:84%
answer the question, who am
I, when they're in school--

00:27:13.230 --> 00:27:16.320 align:middle line:84%
that determines how
they respond when

00:27:16.320 --> 00:27:18.180 align:middle line:84%
they are bullied
by another person,

00:27:18.180 --> 00:27:20.250 align:middle line:84%
whether it's cyber bullying
or direct bullying.

00:27:20.250 --> 00:27:24.540 align:middle line:84%
It determines when those young
people create the bullying

00:27:24.540 --> 00:27:25.560 align:middle line:90%
towards other people.

00:27:25.560 --> 00:27:27.720 align:middle line:84%
It's all based on the way
we think of ourselves,

00:27:27.720 --> 00:27:31.680 align:middle line:84%
and when a young person knows
with rock solid certainty

00:27:31.680 --> 00:27:34.170 align:middle line:84%
that there is something very
unique, very special, very

00:27:34.170 --> 00:27:37.350 align:middle line:84%
valuable, and that they
have tremendous worth,

00:27:37.350 --> 00:27:41.354 align:middle line:84%
they will interpret that
bullying very differently

00:27:41.354 --> 00:27:43.020 align:middle line:84%
from a young person
who believes there's

00:27:43.020 --> 00:27:46.930 align:middle line:84%
nothing special about life,
that we're the process of this--

00:27:46.930 --> 00:27:49.950 align:middle line:84%
the result of this
random process.

00:27:49.950 --> 00:27:52.600 align:middle line:84%
There's nothing special
about it, and they're lost.

00:27:52.600 --> 00:27:54.340 align:middle line:90%
They don't have an identity.

00:27:54.340 --> 00:27:58.750 align:middle line:84%
So when they are ridiculed
at a very vulnerable age,

00:27:58.750 --> 00:28:00.601 align:middle line:84%
and they believe
that, sometimes, they

00:28:00.601 --> 00:28:02.850 align:middle line:84%
go as far as to even take
their own lives because they

00:28:02.850 --> 00:28:04.560 align:middle line:90%
believe they're not worth--

00:28:04.560 --> 00:28:07.250 align:middle line:84%
they're not worth
being in this world.

00:28:07.250 --> 00:28:08.940 align:middle line:90%
And that's just one example.

00:28:08.940 --> 00:28:11.730 align:middle line:84%
But the way we answer
the question who are we--

00:28:11.730 --> 00:28:13.590 align:middle line:84%
it defines the way
we build our society,

00:28:13.590 --> 00:28:16.290 align:middle line:84%
the way we solve our problems,
what kind of relationships

00:28:16.290 --> 00:28:18.990 align:middle line:84%
we create, who we
share our homes with,

00:28:18.990 --> 00:28:20.160 align:middle line:90%
who we share our bed with.

00:28:20.160 --> 00:28:21.785 align:middle line:84%
I mean, let's get
real, as adults, it's

00:28:21.785 --> 00:28:25.020 align:middle line:84%
all based on who am I, the
way we heal our bodies,

00:28:25.020 --> 00:28:27.810 align:middle line:84%
the way communities and
nations come together

00:28:27.810 --> 00:28:28.810 align:middle line:90%
to defend themselves.

00:28:28.810 --> 00:28:31.017 align:middle line:84%
When we send an army
into another nation,

00:28:31.017 --> 00:28:32.850 align:middle line:84%
and how we treat those
people-- as different

00:28:32.850 --> 00:28:36.990 align:middle line:84%
as all of those things are, it
all comes down to who are we.

00:28:36.990 --> 00:28:38.700 align:middle line:84%
And we've been led
to believe, and we've

00:28:38.700 --> 00:28:40.790 align:middle line:84%
been steeped in a
story that's not true.

00:28:40.790 --> 00:28:43.620 align:middle line:84%
It's a false story of
separation, competition,

00:28:43.620 --> 00:28:48.090 align:middle line:84%
conflict, that there's
nothing special about us

00:28:48.090 --> 00:28:50.670 align:middle line:84%
and about life, and we
have the opportunity now

00:28:50.670 --> 00:28:52.770 align:middle line:84%
to raise an entire
new generation

00:28:52.770 --> 00:28:55.320 align:middle line:84%
