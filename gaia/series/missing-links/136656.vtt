>>GREGG BRADEN: My
name's Gregg Braden.

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:30.020 align:middle line:84%
And I'd like to welcome you to
this very special presentation

00:00:30.020 --> 00:00:33.710 align:middle line:84%
of "Missing Links", the deep
truth of our origin, history,

00:00:33.710 --> 00:00:35.510 align:middle line:90%
destiny, and fate.

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:37.700 align:middle line:84%
In the last episode,
I shared with you

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:40.850 align:middle line:84%
the science based experiments
that not only confirm

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:43.040 align:middle line:84%
that we are deeply
connected to our world,

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:45.560 align:middle line:84%
but they go beyond that,
showing that this connection is

00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:49.460 align:middle line:84%
so deep, in fact, that it
begins at the very core

00:00:49.460 --> 00:00:53.450 align:middle line:84%
of our existence, with our DNA,
where we interact with life,

00:00:53.450 --> 00:00:55.550 align:middle line:90%
and even reality itself.

00:00:55.550 --> 00:00:57.020 align:middle line:84%
Well, today we're
going to zero in

00:00:57.020 --> 00:01:00.470 align:middle line:84%
on what it is about our
DNA that sets us apart

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:05.000 align:middle line:84%
from all other life and gives
us the extraordinary ability

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:07.610 align:middle line:84%
to influence our lives
and our world on such

00:01:07.610 --> 00:01:09.470 align:middle line:90%
a deep and intimate level.

00:01:09.470 --> 00:01:14.090 align:middle line:84%
And it all begins with where
we come from, our origins.

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:16.250 align:middle line:84%
While scientists are
scrambling to unlock

00:01:16.250 --> 00:01:18.230 align:middle line:84%
the mystery of our
beginning, they're

00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:22.280 align:middle line:84%
also confining themselves to
a limited belief system that

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:24.110 align:middle line:84%
says the mystery has
already been solved

00:01:24.110 --> 00:01:26.884 align:middle line:90%
and that evolution is our story.

00:01:26.884 --> 00:01:28.550 align:middle line:84%
Well, I want to say
right now that there

00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:32.390 align:middle line:84%
is a huge difference between
forcing the evidence that we

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:35.660 align:middle line:84%
discover, such as bones, teeth
and fossils of ancient forms

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:40.580 align:middle line:84%
of life, into a preconceived
idea of how, or even if, they

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:41.510 align:middle line:90%
relate to us.

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:45.320 align:middle line:84%
It's a huge difference between
doing that and allowing

00:01:45.320 --> 00:01:49.730 align:middle line:84%
these discoveries, wherever they
are, to lead where they will

00:01:49.730 --> 00:01:53.000 align:middle line:84%
and tell whatever
story it is they hold.

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:55.610 align:middle line:84%
Today, we're going to discover
why scientists have now

00:01:55.610 --> 00:01:58.580 align:middle line:84%
come to a dead end when
it comes to explaining

00:01:58.580 --> 00:02:02.480 align:middle line:84%
the mystery of our past
and why the new evidence no

00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:04.940 align:middle line:84%
longer supports the
conventional story when

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:07.050 align:middle line:90%
it comes to us and our origin.

00:02:07.050 --> 00:02:09.539 align:middle line:90%
And it all begins with a book.

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:12.260 align:middle line:84%
It's a book that was
published in 1859,

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:16.690 align:middle line:84%
and the beliefs of the man that
wrote the book, Charles Darwin.

00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:18.900 align:middle line:84%
Charles Darwin
released his book,

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:22.980 align:middle line:84%
titled "The Origin
of Species" in 1859.

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:26.760 align:middle line:10%
And prior to that
time, the big questions

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:29.607 align:middle line:10%
of life, when we asked those
questions of ourselves,

00:02:29.607 --> 00:02:31.440 align:middle line:10%
where does life come
from, how does it work,

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:34.560 align:middle line:10%
what do we do to make things
better in our world, the answer

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:37.110 align:middle line:10%
to those kinds of
questions, those answers

00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:39.240 align:middle line:10%
came from religious
organizations,

00:02:39.240 --> 00:02:40.810 align:middle line:10%
from the church primarily.

00:02:40.810 --> 00:02:43.650 align:middle line:84%
And Darwin said, he
said, I would like

00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:46.350 align:middle line:90%
to establish a stepping stone.

00:02:46.350 --> 00:02:51.000 align:middle line:84%
Let's make the first step
away from using faith

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:54.390 align:middle line:84%
to describe where it is that
we come from and who we are.

00:02:54.390 --> 00:02:56.550 align:middle line:90%
Let's do this based in science.

00:02:56.550 --> 00:02:59.100 align:middle line:10%
And it's for that
reason that in 1859,

00:02:59.100 --> 00:03:01.800 align:middle line:10%
when Darwin released
his first work, that it

00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:03.150 align:middle line:10%
was widely accepted.

00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:04.280 align:middle line:90%
It was quickly embraced.

00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:07.120 align:middle line:84%
It wasn't questioned very much,
because he was a scientist.

00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:08.550 align:middle line:90%
He was a geologist.

00:03:08.550 --> 00:03:10.320 align:middle line:84%
And when he released
this information,

00:03:10.320 --> 00:03:15.300 align:middle line:84%
it quickly became ingrained
into mainstream thinking.

00:03:15.300 --> 00:03:16.950 align:middle line:90%
I want to go back a little bit.

00:03:16.950 --> 00:03:18.491 align:middle line:84%
I want to share with
you a little bit

00:03:18.491 --> 00:03:21.150 align:middle line:84%
about Darwin, my
feelings about Darwin,

00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:25.290 align:middle line:84%
where I think he may have
strayed from the deepest truths

00:03:25.290 --> 00:03:27.210 align:middle line:90%
of our existence, and why.

00:03:27.210 --> 00:03:30.420 align:middle line:84%
And I want to begin
that conversation, first

00:03:30.420 --> 00:03:33.210 align:middle line:84%
just by sharing with you the
full title of the book that you

00:03:33.210 --> 00:03:35.130 align:middle line:90%
rarely get to see.

00:03:35.130 --> 00:03:37.080 align:middle line:84%
When Darwin's book
was published,

00:03:37.080 --> 00:03:39.580 align:middle line:84%
in the early part
of the 20th century,

00:03:39.580 --> 00:03:41.460 align:middle line:84%
the main title was on
the front of the book,

00:03:41.460 --> 00:03:43.230 align:middle line:90%
"The Origin of Species".

00:03:43.230 --> 00:03:46.290 align:middle line:84%
The rest of the title was taken
off of the front of the book.

00:03:46.290 --> 00:03:49.500 align:middle line:10%
It was relegated to
the inside covers,

00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:52.650 align:middle line:10%
because of the implications
of what he was saying.

00:03:52.650 --> 00:03:57.780 align:middle line:84%
So let me read to you precisely
what this lengthy title was,

00:03:57.780 --> 00:04:00.370 align:middle line:84%
and then we can talk about what
it means from his perspective.

00:04:00.370 --> 00:04:02.953 align:middle line:10%
And that will lead us right in
to what the new discoveries are

00:04:02.953 --> 00:04:04.840 align:middle line:10%
showing us.

00:04:04.840 --> 00:04:08.320 align:middle line:10%
The original tile,
"Origin of a Species",

00:04:08.320 --> 00:04:12.520 align:middle line:10%
was this, "The Origin
of Species by Means

00:04:12.520 --> 00:04:14.410 align:middle line:10%
of Natural Selection"--

00:04:14.410 --> 00:04:15.610 align:middle line:10%
that's the title.

00:04:15.610 --> 00:04:18.790 align:middle line:10%
The subtitle began
with the word "or".

00:04:18.790 --> 00:04:23.590 align:middle line:10%
And it says, "Or the
Preservation of Favored Races

00:04:23.590 --> 00:04:26.620 align:middle line:10%
in the Struggle for Life".

00:04:26.620 --> 00:04:30.490 align:middle line:84%
That title tells us a lot about
Darwin, about his thinking.

00:04:30.490 --> 00:04:32.830 align:middle line:84%
Number one, he believed that
there were favored races,

00:04:32.830 --> 00:04:35.890 align:middle line:84%
that there were some that were
favored over others in nature.

00:04:35.890 --> 00:04:39.310 align:middle line:84%
And he believed that life
was a struggle to begin with.

00:04:39.310 --> 00:04:41.890 align:middle line:84%
And it's through this lens,
through this perspective

00:04:41.890 --> 00:04:44.230 align:middle line:84%
of struggle that Darwin
interpreted everything

00:04:44.230 --> 00:04:47.220 align:middle line:84%
that he saw in his
studies and in his world.

00:04:47.220 --> 00:04:51.790 align:middle line:84%
Well, I'd like to begin, before
we get into the theory itself,

00:04:51.790 --> 00:04:55.240 align:middle line:84%
with a little bit about my
experience with Darwin's work.

00:04:55.240 --> 00:04:56.110 align:middle line:90%
I'm a geologist.

00:04:56.110 --> 00:04:57.250 align:middle line:90%
I'm a degreed geologist.

00:04:57.250 --> 00:05:01.570 align:middle line:84%
And so I relate to much
of Darwin's mechanism

00:05:01.570 --> 00:05:03.910 align:middle line:90%
of exploration, his thinking.

00:05:03.910 --> 00:05:05.070 align:middle line:90%
Darwin was a scientist.

00:05:05.070 --> 00:05:07.000 align:middle line:84%
And I think he was
a good scientist.

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:11.110 align:middle line:84%
He could not possibly have
known in his day what we now

00:05:11.110 --> 00:05:11.920 align:middle line:90%
know in ours.

00:05:11.920 --> 00:05:14.260 align:middle line:84%
He couldn't have
known about DNA.

00:05:14.260 --> 00:05:17.230 align:middle line:84%
He couldn't have known the
deep secrets of biology.

00:05:17.230 --> 00:05:21.880 align:middle line:84%
In the 1850s, scientists weren't
even sure what cells were.

00:05:21.880 --> 00:05:24.712 align:middle line:84%
So, just to invite you to
think about that a little bit.

00:05:24.712 --> 00:05:28.341 align:middle line:84%
I think Darwin's observations
were good, in my opinion.

00:05:28.341 --> 00:05:30.340 align:middle line:84%
And I'm deviating from
the science a little bit.

00:05:30.340 --> 00:05:32.200 align:middle line:90%
This is a personal perspective.

00:05:32.200 --> 00:05:34.540 align:middle line:84%
Here's where I think
Darwin went wrong.

00:05:34.540 --> 00:05:38.380 align:middle line:84%
Darwin went into nature
to observe nature.

00:05:38.380 --> 00:05:43.960 align:middle line:84%
And he believed that what he
saw happening in one place,

00:05:43.960 --> 00:05:47.500 align:middle line:84%
in one moment of time,
in one part of the world,

00:05:47.500 --> 00:05:48.490 align:middle line:90%
in the natural world.

00:05:48.490 --> 00:05:51.370 align:middle line:84%
If he saw birds behaving a
certain way or ants behaving

00:05:51.370 --> 00:05:56.290 align:middle line:84%
a certain way, he believed
that what he saw in that moment

00:05:56.290 --> 00:06:00.100 align:middle line:84%
was a little example that
represented a principle,

00:06:00.100 --> 00:06:04.810 align:middle line:84%
or a rule of nature that applied
to the big world and all life

00:06:04.810 --> 00:06:06.880 align:middle line:90%
everywhere, including us.

00:06:06.880 --> 00:06:09.220 align:middle line:84%
But we all know that there's
no one size that fits

00:06:09.220 --> 00:06:10.429 align:middle line:90%
all when it comes to nature.

00:06:10.429 --> 00:06:11.470 align:middle line:90%
It doesn't work that way.

00:06:11.470 --> 00:06:14.080 align:middle line:84%
But this is the assumption
that Darwin made.

00:06:14.080 --> 00:06:17.620 align:middle line:84%
So having said that, I
also want to say to you

00:06:17.620 --> 00:06:21.450 align:middle line:84%
that Darwin was very clear, when
he wrote his book, about why

00:06:21.450 --> 00:06:22.250 align:middle line:90%
he was writing it.

00:06:22.250 --> 00:06:25.000 align:middle line:84%
When I researched his
book for my writings,

00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:29.050 align:middle line:84%
I took the time to go back and
read Darwin's own words, not

00:06:29.050 --> 00:06:32.590 align:middle line:84%
the interpretation through an
academic professor or somewhere

00:06:32.590 --> 00:06:34.270 align:middle line:84%
from a university
or a philosopher.

00:06:34.270 --> 00:06:36.960 align:middle line:84%
I wanted to see what
Darwin was thinking.

00:06:36.960 --> 00:06:38.410 align:middle line:90%
And it's not an easy read.

00:06:38.410 --> 00:06:41.980 align:middle line:84%
He had very complex language,
very flowery kind of adjectives

00:06:41.980 --> 00:06:44.804 align:middle line:84%
that he was using, almost
like a philosopher.

00:06:44.804 --> 00:06:46.220 align:middle line:84%
But I want to share
this with you.

00:06:46.220 --> 00:06:48.850 align:middle line:84%
And I want to share this
in Darwin's own words.

00:06:48.850 --> 00:06:54.670 align:middle line:84%
Because even Darwin knew that
his theory would probably fall.

00:06:54.670 --> 00:06:57.580 align:middle line:84%
And I want you to know that he
was OK with his theory falling.

00:06:57.580 --> 00:07:00.680 align:middle line:84%
Darwin was perfectly OK
with his theory falling.

00:07:00.680 --> 00:07:03.010 align:middle line:84%
It's mainstream
academia today that's

00:07:03.010 --> 00:07:06.310 align:middle line:84%
having a problem letting
go of Darwin's theory.

00:07:06.310 --> 00:07:07.580 align:middle line:90%
Listen to Darwin's own word.

00:07:07.580 --> 00:07:09.370 align:middle line:90%
Here's what he said.

00:07:09.370 --> 00:07:10.700 align:middle line:90%
This is a quote.

00:07:10.700 --> 00:07:13.180 align:middle line:84%
He said, "if it
could be demonstrated

00:07:13.180 --> 00:07:18.190 align:middle line:84%
that any complex organ existed,
which could not possibly

00:07:18.190 --> 00:07:22.390 align:middle line:84%
have been formed by
numerous successive slight

00:07:22.390 --> 00:07:26.410 align:middle line:84%
modifications", he said,
"my theory would absolutely

00:07:26.410 --> 00:07:27.370 align:middle line:90%
break down."

00:07:27.370 --> 00:07:29.510 align:middle line:84%
My theory would
absolutely break down.

00:07:29.510 --> 00:07:30.310 align:middle line:90%
All right.

00:07:30.310 --> 00:07:32.290 align:middle line:90%
So what's Darwin saying to us?

00:07:32.290 --> 00:07:36.790 align:middle line:84%
He's saying that in this
theory of evolution of organs

00:07:36.790 --> 00:07:39.197 align:middle line:84%
and attributes developing
slowly, gradually

00:07:39.197 --> 00:07:40.780 align:middle line:84%
over long periods
of time, he's saying

00:07:40.780 --> 00:07:43.180 align:middle line:84%
if we could ever find
even one example,

00:07:43.180 --> 00:07:46.300 align:middle line:84%
if we found one example where
that theory didn't apply,

00:07:46.300 --> 00:07:48.260 align:middle line:84%
the whole theory
would fall apart.

00:07:48.260 --> 00:07:50.560 align:middle line:84%
Well, not only found one,
we found many examples.

00:07:50.560 --> 00:07:53.740 align:middle line:84%
The human eye is
a perfect example.

00:07:53.740 --> 00:07:57.700 align:middle line:84%
The way the proteins
come together

00:07:57.700 --> 00:08:00.250 align:middle line:84%
to create the clotting
mechanism in our blood

00:08:00.250 --> 00:08:01.900 align:middle line:90%
is a perfect example.

00:08:01.900 --> 00:08:04.150 align:middle line:84%
The way cells work
is a perfect example.

00:08:04.150 --> 00:08:07.660 align:middle line:84%
Every cell has to have
a way of taking in,

00:08:07.660 --> 00:08:10.660 align:middle line:84%
of eating nutrients, of
excreting those nutrients,

00:08:10.660 --> 00:08:12.610 align:middle line:90%
of reproducing.

00:08:12.610 --> 00:08:17.770 align:middle line:84%
And evolution says that
those kinds of attributes

00:08:17.770 --> 00:08:21.010 align:middle line:84%
should come slowly, gradually
over long periods of time.

00:08:21.010 --> 00:08:22.690 align:middle line:84%
But if you think
about it, it can't.

00:08:22.690 --> 00:08:25.148 align:middle line:84%
They all have to be there at
once for the cell to function.

00:08:25.148 --> 00:08:27.190 align:middle line:84%
If a cell is able to
eat but not excrete,

00:08:27.190 --> 00:08:28.540 align:middle line:90%
that's not going to work.

00:08:28.540 --> 00:08:30.970 align:middle line:84%
If a cell can live
but not produce,

00:08:30.970 --> 00:08:32.679 align:middle line:84%
you're not going to
see many more cells.

00:08:32.679 --> 00:08:35.289 align:middle line:84%
So a cell is a perfect
example of where

00:08:35.289 --> 00:08:39.280 align:middle line:84%
all of these attributes have
to be in place all at once

00:08:39.280 --> 00:08:40.539 align:middle line:90%
for the organism to live.

00:08:40.539 --> 00:08:47.920 align:middle line:84%
They cannot be gradually
created or gradually developed

00:08:47.920 --> 00:08:51.890 align:middle line:84%
in response to nature over
a long period of time.

00:08:51.890 --> 00:08:54.040 align:middle line:90%
So what I'd like to do--

00:08:54.040 --> 00:08:56.440 align:middle line:90%
I'm talking about evolution--

00:08:56.440 --> 00:08:59.402 align:middle line:84%
and I'd like to
define evolution.

00:08:59.402 --> 00:09:00.610 align:middle line:90%
Let's go on a little journey.

00:09:00.610 --> 00:09:05.470 align:middle line:84%
Let's go on a 58-second journey
of evolution and what it is

00:09:05.470 --> 00:09:06.490 align:middle line:90%
and what it says to us.

00:09:06.490 --> 00:09:08.110 align:middle line:84%
So if you look at
your screen, this

00:09:08.110 --> 00:09:12.160 align:middle line:84%
is a beautiful graphic example
of exactly how evolution works.

00:09:12.160 --> 00:09:16.420 align:middle line:84%
Darwin believed that in
the beginning, life formed.

00:09:16.420 --> 00:09:19.780 align:middle line:84%
And he said himself, he
didn't know how life began.

00:09:19.780 --> 00:09:24.190 align:middle line:84%
So he didn't try to explain how
life began in the first place.

00:09:24.190 --> 00:09:27.280 align:middle line:84%
He said, after life was
here, in a primitive form,

00:09:27.280 --> 00:09:29.750 align:middle line:90%
as a single cell, what happened?

00:09:29.750 --> 00:09:32.710 align:middle line:84%
He said that cell began
to grow and become

00:09:32.710 --> 00:09:36.520 align:middle line:84%
more complex over time
in response to what

00:09:36.520 --> 00:09:40.420 align:middle line:84%
the environment, to what
nature was showing that cell.

00:09:40.420 --> 00:09:43.690 align:middle line:84%
When the life form
needed to stay warmer,

00:09:43.690 --> 00:09:46.000 align:middle line:84%
or when it needed to adapt
to a different kind of food,

00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:49.240 align:middle line:84%
or when it needed to sense
differently in its environment,

00:09:49.240 --> 00:09:52.990 align:middle line:84%
those kinds of things
would trigger a mechanism

00:09:52.990 --> 00:09:56.170 align:middle line:84%
within the organism and new
attributes would develop,

00:09:56.170 --> 00:09:58.390 align:middle line:84%
slowly, gradually, over
long periods of time,

00:09:58.390 --> 00:10:01.750 align:middle line:84%
the organism became
more and more complex

00:10:01.750 --> 00:10:05.320 align:middle line:84%
until it reached the
point where we are

00:10:05.320 --> 00:10:08.770 align:middle line:84%
today, with humankind
being the pinnacle,

00:10:08.770 --> 00:10:12.520 align:middle line:84%
at this point, of what
evolution is saying to us.

00:10:12.520 --> 00:10:18.280 align:middle line:84%
So since 1859, this mechanism
that I've just shared with you

00:10:18.280 --> 00:10:21.640 align:middle line:84%
has been the thinking
underlying biology

00:10:21.640 --> 00:10:25.720 align:middle line:84%
and human origins, where we
come from and how we got here.

00:10:25.720 --> 00:10:28.090 align:middle line:84%
Since 1859, the
thinking has been

00:10:28.090 --> 00:10:32.320 align:middle line:84%
that those organisms, as
they grew and developed

00:10:32.320 --> 00:10:35.160 align:middle line:84%
new attributes over
long periods of time,

00:10:35.160 --> 00:10:39.040 align:middle line:84%
that when they would die, they
would leave a fossilized record

00:10:39.040 --> 00:10:43.770 align:middle line:84%
of that moment, a snapshot
of that moment in evolution,

00:10:43.770 --> 00:10:48.920 align:middle line:84%
and that we should be able
to find those in the world.

00:10:48.920 --> 00:10:52.810 align:middle line:84%
And when we do, they
will begin to give us

00:10:52.810 --> 00:10:54.790 align:middle line:84%
what's called the
evolutionary family

00:10:54.790 --> 00:10:57.640 align:middle line:84%
tree that leads from
those primitive organisms

00:10:57.640 --> 00:10:59.510 align:middle line:90%
to where we are today.

00:10:59.510 --> 00:11:01.150 align:middle line:84%
So the question has
always been, how

00:11:01.150 --> 00:11:02.590 align:middle line:90%
do we get from there to here?

00:11:02.590 --> 00:11:04.690 align:middle line:84%
How do we get from
those organisms

00:11:04.690 --> 00:11:06.560 align:middle line:90%
to where we are today?

00:11:06.560 --> 00:11:11.140 align:middle line:84%
And the thinking that this
gradual transition must

00:11:11.140 --> 00:11:14.110 align:middle line:84%
be available to us
in the fossil record

00:11:14.110 --> 00:11:18.190 align:middle line:84%
is at the very foundation, it's
at the root of human biology

00:11:18.190 --> 00:11:21.520 align:middle line:84%
and the way we think about
our evolutionary past today.

00:11:21.520 --> 00:11:24.400 align:middle line:84%
But I also want to say
to you that when Darwin

00:11:24.400 --> 00:11:29.800 align:middle line:84%
put his theory together, even
he had questions as to why

00:11:29.800 --> 00:11:34.090 align:middle line:84%
we don't see more of the
kind of evidence that he said

00:11:34.090 --> 00:11:36.940 align:middle line:84%
should be available
if we, in fact, are

00:11:36.940 --> 00:11:39.580 align:middle line:84%
the result of this long,
slow, gradual evolution.

00:11:39.580 --> 00:11:42.880 align:middle line:84%
He said, we ought to find
these fossils everywhere.

00:11:42.880 --> 00:11:45.820 align:middle line:84%
I want you to see, once again,
Darwin's own language, so

00:11:45.820 --> 00:11:49.360 align:middle line:84%
that in your mind, you're
beginning to have an insight

00:11:49.360 --> 00:11:51.940 align:middle line:84%
and beginning to think the
way that Darwin was thinking.

00:11:51.940 --> 00:11:54.340 align:middle line:90%
What Darwin said is this.

00:11:54.340 --> 00:11:56.390 align:middle line:10%
He said-- and this is a quote--

00:11:56.390 --> 00:11:59.290 align:middle line:10%
he said "the number of
intermediate varieties,

00:11:59.290 --> 00:12:03.256 align:middle line:10%
which have formerly existed,
must be truly enormous."

00:12:03.256 --> 00:12:05.380 align:middle line:84%
So he's saying there's
obviously been a lot of life

00:12:05.380 --> 00:12:07.240 align:middle line:90%
in the world in the past.

00:12:07.240 --> 00:12:08.830 align:middle line:90%
Here's his question.

00:12:08.830 --> 00:12:14.170 align:middle line:84%
He said, "why then is not
every geological formation

00:12:14.170 --> 00:12:19.960 align:middle line:84%
and every geologic stratum full
of such intermediate links?

00:12:19.960 --> 00:12:26.260 align:middle line:84%
Geology assuredly does not
reveal any such finely gradated

00:12:26.260 --> 00:12:27.640 align:middle line:90%
organic chain.

00:12:27.640 --> 00:12:32.740 align:middle line:84%
And this, perhaps, is the most
obvious and serious objection

00:12:32.740 --> 00:12:35.600 align:middle line:84%
which can be urged
against my theory."

00:12:35.600 --> 00:12:38.119 align:middle line:84%
So Darwin is saying, he's
admitting, he's saying,

00:12:38.119 --> 00:12:39.160 align:middle line:90%
you know, I've got this--

00:12:39.160 --> 00:12:42.040 align:middle line:84%
I'm paraphrasing-- he's
saying, I've got this theory.

00:12:42.040 --> 00:12:45.340 align:middle line:84%
And even I, as a geologist,
am a little amazed

00:12:45.340 --> 00:12:48.770 align:middle line:84%
that we're not finding more
evidence to support my theory.

00:12:48.770 --> 00:12:52.090 align:middle line:84%
So this is kind of the backdrop
that has been conveniently

00:12:52.090 --> 00:12:55.510 align:middle line:84%
forgotten in the modern world,
in academics and teaching,

00:12:55.510 --> 00:12:59.500 align:middle line:84%
that you won't hear high school,
college professors sharing

00:12:59.500 --> 00:13:00.700 align:middle line:90%
these kinds of doubts.

00:13:00.700 --> 00:13:02.560 align:middle line:84%
And I think it's
important that we

00:13:02.560 --> 00:13:07.710 align:middle line:84%
be honest with ourselves and our
young people in school today.

00:13:07.710 --> 00:13:10.480 align:middle line:84%
I think it's important to be
honest, truthful and factual.

00:13:10.480 --> 00:13:14.220 align:middle line:84%
And I'm about to share with
you the evidence, the very

00:13:14.220 --> 00:13:17.760 align:middle line:84%
unpopular evidence that does
not support Darwin's theory.

00:13:17.760 --> 00:13:18.970 align:middle line:90%
And I also want to be clear.

00:13:18.970 --> 00:13:21.390 align:middle line:84%
I'm not suggesting
that we throw out

00:13:21.390 --> 00:13:23.280 align:middle line:84%
all of the theories
of evolution and stop

00:13:23.280 --> 00:13:25.920 align:middle line:90%
teaching them in our schools.

00:13:25.920 --> 00:13:28.620 align:middle line:84%
I believe that we owe
it to our young people

00:13:28.620 --> 00:13:30.260 align:middle line:84%
to honor them with
all the information,

00:13:30.260 --> 00:13:33.390 align:middle line:84%
show them everything, show them
the idea of Darwin's theory,

00:13:33.390 --> 00:13:34.770 align:middle line:90%
show them the new evidence.

00:13:34.770 --> 00:13:36.480 align:middle line:90%
And here's why that's important.

00:13:36.480 --> 00:13:40.311 align:middle line:84%
Young people love to know if
they are living in a world

00:13:40.311 --> 00:13:42.060 align:middle line:84%
where the mysteries
have yet to be solved,

00:13:42.060 --> 00:13:43.893 align:middle line:84%
because it means maybe
they're the ones that

00:13:43.893 --> 00:13:44.970 align:middle line:90%
can solve the mystery.

00:13:44.970 --> 00:13:47.310 align:middle line:84%
And that's much more
exciting to study

00:13:47.310 --> 00:13:50.100 align:middle line:84%
than to study a rigid
academic theory,

00:13:50.100 --> 00:13:51.750 align:middle line:84%
where we say it's
all buttoned down

00:13:51.750 --> 00:13:53.749 align:middle line:84%
and we already know
everything there is to know.

00:13:53.749 --> 00:13:55.320 align:middle line:90%
That's not the case.

00:13:55.320 --> 00:13:58.860 align:middle line:84%
So the thinking
has been that as we

00:13:58.860 --> 00:14:01.690 align:middle line:84%
find these primitive
forms of life--

00:14:01.690 --> 00:14:04.200 align:middle line:84%
and I know you've
seen these before.

00:14:04.200 --> 00:14:06.810 align:middle line:90%
I grew up in the '50s, '60s.

00:14:06.810 --> 00:14:10.890 align:middle line:84%
And it was a very exciting
time in anthropology.

00:14:10.890 --> 00:14:14.160 align:middle line:84%
Louis Leakey, the Leakey
Foundation, the Olduvai gorge

00:14:14.160 --> 00:14:17.190 align:middle line:84%
in Africa, where
they kept finding

00:14:17.190 --> 00:14:20.970 align:middle line:84%
older and older examples,
fossilized examples

00:14:20.970 --> 00:14:22.620 align:middle line:90%
of these primitive beings.

00:14:22.620 --> 00:14:26.340 align:middle line:84%
And the magazines, the flashy
magazines on the newsstands

00:14:26.340 --> 00:14:29.400 align:middle line:84%
would have these big titles,
The Age of Human Ancestors,

00:14:29.400 --> 00:14:32.130 align:middle line:84%
would push back again
and again and again.

00:14:32.130 --> 00:14:34.590 align:middle line:84%
And we all heard things
like Australopithecus.

00:14:34.590 --> 00:14:37.700 align:middle line:84%
It was better known as
Lucy or Homo habilis.

00:14:37.700 --> 00:14:40.120 align:middle line:84%
It was called the
handyman, or Neanderthal.

00:14:40.120 --> 00:14:41.910 align:middle line:84%
And these are the
examples that were

00:14:41.910 --> 00:14:46.590 align:middle line:84%
given as being evidence that
was discovered that was believed

00:14:46.590 --> 00:14:48.941 align:middle line:90%
to support Darwin's theory.

00:14:48.941 --> 00:14:51.190 align:middle line:84%
Well, this is what I want
to share with you right now.

00:14:51.190 --> 00:14:54.900 align:middle line:84%
The problem is that the evidence
doesn't support the theory.

00:14:54.900 --> 00:14:57.540 align:middle line:84%
The evidence does not
support the theory.

00:14:57.540 --> 00:15:02.440 align:middle line:84%
If you look at a traditional
tree of human evolution,

00:15:02.440 --> 00:15:05.040 align:middle line:84%
it's called the human
evolutionary tree,

00:15:05.040 --> 00:15:09.957 align:middle line:84%
we see human at the top of
the tree and leading up to us

00:15:09.957 --> 00:15:12.540 align:middle line:84%
are all of what are believed to
be these intermediate species,

00:15:12.540 --> 00:15:15.360 align:middle line:84%
and we're all connected
by these lines from one

00:15:15.360 --> 00:15:17.230 align:middle line:90%
to another and another up to us.

00:15:17.230 --> 00:15:18.090 align:middle line:90%
Here's the thing.

00:15:18.090 --> 00:15:21.510 align:middle line:84%
Look closely the next time
you observe one of these,

00:15:21.510 --> 00:15:24.330 align:middle line:84%
or look at the one that's
on your screen right now.

00:15:24.330 --> 00:15:27.140 align:middle line:84%
And if you look at the
legend, the little box that

00:15:27.140 --> 00:15:29.040 align:middle line:84%
describes everything
that's happening,

00:15:29.040 --> 00:15:31.866 align:middle line:84%
those lines generally
are dotted lines.

00:15:31.866 --> 00:15:33.240 align:middle line:84%
And the reason
they are dotted is

00:15:33.240 --> 00:15:39.450 align:middle line:84%
because they are called inferred
or speculative relationships.

00:15:39.450 --> 00:15:42.180 align:middle line:90%
Inferred, or speculative.

00:15:42.180 --> 00:15:45.810 align:middle line:84%
That means the scientists
suspect they exist,

00:15:45.810 --> 00:15:48.780 align:middle line:84%
but they have yet
to find the proof

00:15:48.780 --> 00:15:52.500 align:middle line:84%
to actually nail down their
existence of this relationship.

00:15:52.500 --> 00:15:54.780 align:middle line:10%
They're believed to
be true, and they

00:15:54.780 --> 00:15:57.120 align:middle line:10%
have been believed
since 1859, when

00:15:57.120 --> 00:15:58.500 align:middle line:10%
Darwin proposed the theory.

00:15:58.500 --> 00:16:01.200 align:middle line:84%
I don't know about
you, my thinking,

00:16:01.200 --> 00:16:05.160 align:middle line:84%
since 1859 until where
we are right now,

00:16:05.160 --> 00:16:09.900 align:middle line:84%
it's about 150 years, we have
had the best minds in academia,

00:16:09.900 --> 00:16:12.172 align:middle line:84%
the best scientists, we've
had the most sophisticated

00:16:12.172 --> 00:16:14.130 align:middle line:84%
equipment, we've had the
greatest universities,

00:16:14.130 --> 00:16:16.650 align:middle line:84%
we've had the most
funding, the most money,

00:16:16.650 --> 00:16:20.242 align:middle line:84%
all directed toward solving
this mystery of our origin.

00:16:20.242 --> 00:16:22.200 align:middle line:84%
And I think that if we
were on the right track,

00:16:22.200 --> 00:16:24.540 align:middle line:84%
we'd be further along
than we are right now.

00:16:24.540 --> 00:16:27.060 align:middle line:84%
We would have some of those
dotted lines be solid lines.

00:16:27.060 --> 00:16:28.480 align:middle line:90%
But they are not.

00:16:28.480 --> 00:16:29.280 align:middle line:90%
They are not.

00:16:29.280 --> 00:16:32.520 align:middle line:84%
And the scientists keep saying--
and I have friends in academia

00:16:32.520 --> 00:16:34.890 align:middle line:84%
who are teaching this in
universities right now--

00:16:34.890 --> 00:16:37.440 align:middle line:84%
they're saying we just haven't
looked in the right place.

00:16:37.440 --> 00:16:39.510 align:middle line:84%
We just haven't found
the right fossil.

00:16:39.510 --> 00:16:42.270 align:middle line:84%
We just haven't looked in
the right part of the world

00:16:42.270 --> 00:16:44.160 align:middle line:90%
and found this evidence yet.

00:16:44.160 --> 00:16:48.570 align:middle line:84%
Well, that physical evidence
is only a part of the key.

00:16:48.570 --> 00:16:50.910 align:middle line:10%
Because now we have
new evidence that's

00:16:50.910 --> 00:16:52.590 align:middle line:10%
taking us light years
farther and it's

00:16:52.590 --> 00:16:54.900 align:middle line:10%
telling us why the
physical evidence may not

00:16:54.900 --> 00:16:56.790 align:middle line:10%
be supporting this story.

00:16:56.790 --> 00:17:01.020 align:middle line:84%
So you've all heard of missing
links, and the missing links

00:17:01.020 --> 00:17:03.450 align:middle line:84%
when it comes to
human evolution.

00:17:03.450 --> 00:17:05.849 align:middle line:84%
The truth is that the missing
links are still missing,

00:17:05.849 --> 00:17:08.490 align:middle line:84%
and I think they always will be,
because the evidence suggests

00:17:08.490 --> 00:17:10.970 align:middle line:90%
that they probably do not exist.

00:17:10.970 --> 00:17:12.599 align:middle line:90%
Let me tell you why.

00:17:12.599 --> 00:17:15.300 align:middle line:84%
Human DNA is beginning
to tell a new story.

00:17:15.300 --> 00:17:17.300 align:middle line:90%
And it's an exciting story.

00:17:17.300 --> 00:17:22.020 align:middle line:84%
This sounds like science
fiction, CSI kinds of stuff.

00:17:22.020 --> 00:17:25.560 align:middle line:84%
But we are actually
able to cull the DNA

00:17:25.560 --> 00:17:28.560 align:middle line:84%
from a human out
of the bone marrow

00:17:28.560 --> 00:17:32.250 align:middle line:84%
from their fossils that
are thousands and thousands

00:17:32.250 --> 00:17:34.470 align:middle line:84%
and thousands of
years old in a way

00:17:34.470 --> 00:17:36.490 align:middle line:84%
that we have not been
able to do in the past.

00:17:36.490 --> 00:17:38.564 align:middle line:84%
That's the state of
the DNA right now.

00:17:38.564 --> 00:17:40.230 align:middle line:84%
So I'm just going to
begin with a story.

00:17:40.230 --> 00:17:42.840 align:middle line:90%
In 1987, northern Europe.

00:17:42.840 --> 00:17:44.520 align:middle line:90%
We've all heard of Neanderthal.

00:17:44.520 --> 00:17:45.936 align:middle line:84%
We've been taught
that Neanderthal

00:17:45.936 --> 00:17:47.440 align:middle line:90%
is one of our ancestors.

00:17:47.440 --> 00:17:50.940 align:middle line:84%
Well, 1987, the body of a
Neanderthal infant, a baby

00:17:50.940 --> 00:17:54.030 align:middle line:84%
girl, was discovered in a
rare state of preservation

00:17:54.030 --> 00:17:57.750 align:middle line:84%
that we have never seen
before and never seen since.

00:17:57.750 --> 00:18:01.260 align:middle line:84%
She was carbon dated to
about 30,000 years old.

00:18:01.260 --> 00:18:03.580 align:middle line:84%
And she's supposed to
be one of our ancestors.

00:18:03.580 --> 00:18:06.210 align:middle line:84%
So all of a sudden
now, we have the DNA

00:18:06.210 --> 00:18:08.760 align:middle line:84%
of a being that's supposed
to be our ancestor

00:18:08.760 --> 00:18:12.030 align:middle line:84%
that we can compare
to our DNA today

00:18:12.030 --> 00:18:14.430 align:middle line:84%
to see how much overlap
there really is.

00:18:14.430 --> 00:18:16.920 align:middle line:84%
They were able to pull the
DNA out of the bone marrow

00:18:16.920 --> 00:18:20.100 align:middle line:84%
from one of her toes that
was preserved so very

00:18:20.100 --> 00:18:22.020 align:middle line:84%
well, the bone of
one of her toes

00:18:22.020 --> 00:18:24.240 align:middle line:90%
that was preserved so very well.

00:18:24.240 --> 00:18:25.950 align:middle line:90%
I'm going to cut to the chase.

00:18:25.950 --> 00:18:28.500 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to go to the very
last sentence of the very

00:18:28.500 --> 00:18:32.250 align:middle line:84%
last paragraph in the very
prestigious journal "Nature",

00:18:32.250 --> 00:18:35.250 align:middle line:84%
from the study that was
released in the year 2000,

00:18:35.250 --> 00:18:38.940 align:middle line:84%
the conclusion of what this
DNA investigation showed.

00:18:38.940 --> 00:18:41.470 align:middle line:84%
You remember, the
discovery is made in 1987.

00:18:41.470 --> 00:18:44.280 align:middle line:84%
The results were only
released in the year 2000.

00:18:44.280 --> 00:18:46.020 align:middle line:10%
Here's what they said.

00:18:46.020 --> 00:18:48.750 align:middle line:10%
The last sentence
says, "the results

00:18:48.750 --> 00:18:52.590 align:middle line:10%
suggest that modern
human was not, in fact,

00:18:52.590 --> 00:18:55.020 align:middle line:10%
descended from Neanderthals."

00:18:55.020 --> 00:18:58.110 align:middle line:10%
Modern human was not
descended from Neanderthals.

00:18:58.110 --> 00:19:01.140 align:middle line:10%
That is from the journal
"Nature", volume 404,

00:19:01.140 --> 00:19:03.570 align:middle line:10%
March 30th in the year 2000.

00:19:03.570 --> 00:19:05.450 align:middle line:90%
So now we know who we're not.

00:19:05.450 --> 00:19:07.200 align:middle line:84%
We're not descended
from Neanderthals.

00:19:07.200 --> 00:19:09.210 align:middle line:84%
And as a matter of
fact, since that time,

00:19:09.210 --> 00:19:12.004 align:middle line:84%
additional evidence has shown
that we shared the Earth

00:19:12.004 --> 00:19:13.920 align:middle line:84%
with the Neanderthal,
which means we could not

00:19:13.920 --> 00:19:15.580 align:middle line:90%
have descended from them.

00:19:15.580 --> 00:19:16.380 align:middle line:90%
All right.

00:19:16.380 --> 00:19:18.840 align:middle line:90%
So now we know who we are not.

00:19:18.840 --> 00:19:22.830 align:middle line:84%
Fast forward to
another DNA discovery.

00:19:22.830 --> 00:19:26.310 align:middle line:84%
You've probably
heard of Cro-Magnon.

00:19:26.310 --> 00:19:29.580 align:middle line:84%
That is a term that was used
when I was in school, back

00:19:29.580 --> 00:19:31.470 align:middle line:90%
in the '60s and '70s.

00:19:31.470 --> 00:19:34.440 align:middle line:84%
And it's still being used
in some places today.

00:19:34.440 --> 00:19:37.300 align:middle line:90%
But the term has been replaced.

00:19:37.300 --> 00:19:39.120 align:middle line:90%
It's no longer used now.

00:19:39.120 --> 00:19:43.050 align:middle line:84%
And the word, the words that
have replaced Cro-Magnon

00:19:43.050 --> 00:19:44.850 align:middle line:90%
are self-explanatory.

00:19:44.850 --> 00:19:50.610 align:middle line:84%
Cro-Magnon is now replaced
with an acronym that is A-M-H,

00:19:50.610 --> 00:19:55.910 align:middle line:84%
the letters A-M-H. They stand
for anatomically modern human.

00:19:55.910 --> 00:19:57.930 align:middle line:90%
And that tells the whole story.

00:19:57.930 --> 00:20:01.410 align:middle line:84%
Anatomically modern humans,
used to be Cro-Magnon.

00:20:01.410 --> 00:20:02.700 align:middle line:90%
We showed up.

00:20:02.700 --> 00:20:07.440 align:middle line:84%
They showed up 200,000
years ago on the earth.

00:20:07.440 --> 00:20:11.490 align:middle line:84%
And they have not
changed since that time.

00:20:11.490 --> 00:20:16.842 align:middle line:84%
That means they are
us, or we are them.

00:20:16.842 --> 00:20:21.750 align:middle line:84%
The DNA of the anatomically
modern humans that showed up

00:20:21.750 --> 00:20:25.340 align:middle line:84%
200,000 years ago and our DNA
is essentially the same DNA.

00:20:25.340 --> 00:20:28.550 align:middle line:84%
If you were to take the skeleton
of an anatomically modern human

00:20:28.550 --> 00:20:31.810 align:middle line:84%
and put it next to mine right
now, except for their legs

00:20:31.810 --> 00:20:34.310 align:middle line:84%
being maybe a little thicker,
their bones, because they were

00:20:34.310 --> 00:20:36.530 align:middle line:84%
running and walking probably
much more than I do,

00:20:36.530 --> 00:20:37.830 align:middle line:90%
you can't tell us apart.

00:20:37.830 --> 00:20:38.630 align:middle line:90%
We are them.

00:20:38.630 --> 00:20:39.800 align:middle line:90%
They are us.

00:20:39.800 --> 00:20:44.810 align:middle line:84%
We showed up on this earth as
fully realized, fully enabled,

00:20:44.810 --> 00:20:49.520 align:middle line:84%
fully capacitated, anatomically
modern humans 200,000 years

00:20:49.520 --> 00:20:51.317 align:middle line:90%
ago, and we haven't changed.

00:20:51.317 --> 00:20:53.150 align:middle line:84%
Now we're going to get
into what this means,

00:20:53.150 --> 00:20:55.940 align:middle line:84%
but I want to tell you, that's
not Darwin's idea of evolution.

00:20:55.940 --> 00:20:57.710 align:middle line:84%
And this is where
the problem comes in.

00:20:57.710 --> 00:21:01.010 align:middle line:84%
I want to read to you just
a couple of quotes from one

00:21:01.010 --> 00:21:02.750 align:middle line:84%
of the research
magazines, so there's

00:21:02.750 --> 00:21:05.840 align:middle line:84%
no doubt in your mind about
what it is that they're saying.

00:21:05.840 --> 00:21:08.330 align:middle line:84%
This is from the journal
"Advances in Anthropology".

00:21:08.330 --> 00:21:11.810 align:middle line:84%
In 2012, scientists
claimed that Cro-Magnon, is

00:21:11.810 --> 00:21:16.310 align:middle line:84%
what they're calling it, the DNA
is fully modern and unchanged.

00:21:16.310 --> 00:21:18.980 align:middle line:84%
They actually have
DNA now that goes back

00:21:18.980 --> 00:21:21.140 align:middle line:84%
over 28,000 years
from these beings.

00:21:21.140 --> 00:21:23.720 align:middle line:84%
They haven't gone all the way
back to the 200,000 year point

00:21:23.720 --> 00:21:24.520 align:middle line:90%
yet.

00:21:24.520 --> 00:21:25.790 align:middle line:90%
But they haven't changed.

00:21:25.790 --> 00:21:28.280 align:middle line:84%
And it says, "this
means that Cro-Magnon

00:21:28.280 --> 00:21:31.190 align:middle line:84%
was a fully modern
individual who

00:21:31.190 --> 00:21:35.200 align:middle line:84%
perhaps had even a larger brain
capacity than we have today."

00:21:35.200 --> 00:21:37.790 align:middle line:84%
Let me just talk to you a
little about the brain capacity.

00:21:37.790 --> 00:21:40.460 align:middle line:84%
They may have had a larger brain
capacity, because it gave them

00:21:40.460 --> 00:21:41.740 align:middle line:90%
more surface area.

00:21:41.740 --> 00:21:44.240 align:middle line:84%
Our brains are a little smaller,
but they're more efficient.

00:21:44.240 --> 00:21:47.180 align:middle line:84%
Because now we have more
folds in our brains.

00:21:47.180 --> 00:21:49.406 align:middle line:90%
That gives us more surface area.

00:21:49.406 --> 00:21:50.530 align:middle line:90%
So what are we saying here?

00:21:50.530 --> 00:21:52.520 align:middle line:84%
What's the bottom
line to all this?

00:21:52.520 --> 00:21:56.210 align:middle line:84%
What we're finding is that we
need a new evolutionary family

00:21:56.210 --> 00:21:57.170 align:middle line:90%
tree.

00:21:57.170 --> 00:21:59.900 align:middle line:84%
The old family tree that
has us at the top, that

00:21:59.900 --> 00:22:01.160 align:middle line:90%
can no longer be the tree.

00:22:01.160 --> 00:22:03.410 align:middle line:10%
Because the evidence
is not supporting what

00:22:03.410 --> 00:22:04.460 align:middle line:10%
that tree has said.

00:22:04.460 --> 00:22:07.850 align:middle line:10%
The new family tree probably
looks more like a bush.

00:22:07.850 --> 00:22:11.000 align:middle line:84%
It does not have
a long succession

00:22:11.000 --> 00:22:15.470 align:middle line:84%
of evolving life forms that
lead up to us It shows, boom,

00:22:15.470 --> 00:22:19.160 align:middle line:84%
we showed up 200,000
years ago in a form

00:22:19.160 --> 00:22:20.440 align:middle line:90%
that still exists today.

00:22:20.440 --> 00:22:21.710 align:middle line:90%
We don't know how or why.

00:22:21.710 --> 00:22:23.850 align:middle line:84%
We're going to begin
talking about that.

00:22:23.850 --> 00:22:26.780 align:middle line:84%
But when it comes to how we
appeared, this is the mystery,

00:22:26.780 --> 00:22:31.230 align:middle line:84%
we haven't changed in
those 200,000 years.

00:22:31.230 --> 00:22:35.090 align:middle line:84%
So now that we know humans
showed up 200,000 years ago,

00:22:35.090 --> 00:22:36.440 align:middle line:90%
two questions.

00:22:36.440 --> 00:22:38.360 align:middle line:90%
Two questions arise immediately.

00:22:38.360 --> 00:22:39.960 align:middle line:90%
Why did it happen?

00:22:39.960 --> 00:22:41.580 align:middle line:90%
Why did we show up as we have?

00:22:41.580 --> 00:22:42.380 align:middle line:90%
And how?

00:22:42.380 --> 00:22:43.588 align:middle line:90%
What is it that triggered it?

00:22:43.588 --> 00:22:46.320 align:middle line:90%
What caused this to happen?

00:22:46.320 --> 00:22:48.240 align:middle line:84%
So I'd like to
take just a moment

00:22:48.240 --> 00:22:52.860 align:middle line:84%
and look a little
closer at what these DNA

00:22:52.860 --> 00:22:55.074 align:middle line:84%
studies between modern
humans and Neanderthal

00:22:55.074 --> 00:22:55.990 align:middle line:90%
are really telling us.

00:22:55.990 --> 00:22:58.110 align:middle line:84%
I know you've heard
about them before.

00:22:58.110 --> 00:23:00.714 align:middle line:10%
I'd like for you to see
them with your own eyes,

00:23:00.714 --> 00:23:04.560 align:middle line:10%
so you know exactly what it is
that scientists are looking at,

00:23:04.560 --> 00:23:07.350 align:middle line:10%
you know what is matching,
what's not matching,

00:23:07.350 --> 00:23:11.640 align:middle line:10%
and you know why that overlap
is not occurring the way that

00:23:11.640 --> 00:23:14.050 align:middle line:10%
has been believed in the past.

00:23:14.050 --> 00:23:16.830 align:middle line:10%
So let me orient you to
what you're seeing here.

00:23:16.830 --> 00:23:22.500 align:middle line:10%
This is a graphic image
of the 23 chromosomes

00:23:22.500 --> 00:23:25.050 align:middle line:10%
that are both human
and Neanderthal.

00:23:25.050 --> 00:23:28.170 align:middle line:10%
We both have 23, 23 chromosomes.

00:23:28.170 --> 00:23:31.260 align:middle line:10%
And you're seeing them
overlaying one another,

00:23:31.260 --> 00:23:34.290 align:middle line:10%
so that we can see
where there is a match

00:23:34.290 --> 00:23:36.750 align:middle line:10%
and where there is not a match.

00:23:36.750 --> 00:23:38.610 align:middle line:90%
The blue is Neanderthal.

00:23:38.610 --> 00:23:40.440 align:middle line:90%
The red is human.

00:23:40.440 --> 00:23:43.760 align:middle line:84%
And if you look closely, and
they are few and far between,

00:23:43.760 --> 00:23:48.450 align:middle line:84%
there are orange bars that you
will see above each chromosome.

00:23:48.450 --> 00:23:53.770 align:middle line:84%
The orange bar tells us
where we have data in common.

00:23:53.770 --> 00:23:57.870 align:middle line:10%
So if you look at
chromosome number one,

00:23:57.870 --> 00:24:01.530 align:middle line:10%
for example, what
you're seeing, all

00:24:01.530 --> 00:24:09.180 align:middle line:10%
of the places above the
actual blue and the red graph,

00:24:09.180 --> 00:24:11.184 align:middle line:10%
every once in awhile--
and I'm highlighting them

00:24:11.184 --> 00:24:13.350 align:middle line:10%
on the screen for you-- you
see a little orange bar.

00:24:13.350 --> 00:24:16.710 align:middle line:10%
That orange bar tells
you where the DNA

00:24:16.710 --> 00:24:20.700 align:middle line:10%
between Neanderthal and human is
common, where it's overlapping.

00:24:20.700 --> 00:24:23.970 align:middle line:10%
And I'm going to share with
you, with these circles,

00:24:23.970 --> 00:24:25.410 align:middle line:10%
I'm going to
highlight them here.

00:24:25.410 --> 00:24:26.610 align:middle line:10%
You don't see very many.

00:24:26.610 --> 00:24:27.690 align:middle line:10%
There are some.

00:24:27.690 --> 00:24:30.810 align:middle line:10%
Because we obviously
are sharing DNA.

00:24:30.810 --> 00:24:32.920 align:middle line:10%
But we share DNA with
all forms of life.

00:24:32.920 --> 00:24:34.710 align:middle line:90%
We share DNA with a fruit fly.

00:24:34.710 --> 00:24:37.320 align:middle line:90%
We share DNA with a cow.

00:24:37.320 --> 00:24:41.820 align:middle line:84%
We share DNA with our pets, our
dogs and our cats and our fish.

00:24:41.820 --> 00:24:46.050 align:middle line:84%
So it's not surprising
that we would share DNA.

00:24:46.050 --> 00:24:48.480 align:middle line:84%
The question is, to
what degree is there

00:24:48.480 --> 00:24:51.780 align:middle line:84%
an overlap between
their DNA and ours?

00:24:51.780 --> 00:24:54.660 align:middle line:10%
And this graph is showing you
why the scientists are making

00:24:54.660 --> 00:24:58.650 align:middle line:10%
the conclusion that there is
such little overlap that they

00:24:58.650 --> 00:25:00.000 align:middle line:10%
are not our ancestors.

00:25:00.000 --> 00:25:02.760 align:middle line:10%
We are not descended
from the DNA.

00:25:02.760 --> 00:25:06.180 align:middle line:10%
And this image is actually
from a peer review journal.

00:25:06.180 --> 00:25:11.100 align:middle line:10%
It's again from the journal
"Nature", volume 444, July,

00:25:11.100 --> 00:25:12.960 align:middle line:10%
2006.

00:25:12.960 --> 00:25:15.950 align:middle line:10%
So scientists have known
about this for a while.

00:25:15.950 --> 00:25:18.656 align:middle line:84%
Yet you are not seeing this
in mainstream textbooks.

00:25:18.656 --> 00:25:20.280 align:middle line:84%
You're not seeing it
in the classrooms.

00:25:20.280 --> 00:25:22.260 align:middle line:84%
Our young people
are not seeing this.

00:25:22.260 --> 00:25:24.810 align:middle line:84%
And we're not seeing it on
the television documentaries

00:25:24.810 --> 00:25:26.010 align:middle line:90%
and the specials.

00:25:26.010 --> 00:25:29.130 align:middle line:84%
It does not support the
traditional mainstream story

00:25:29.130 --> 00:25:32.160 align:middle line:84%
of us, our origins,
where we came from

00:25:32.160 --> 00:25:34.290 align:middle line:90%
and who our ancestors are.

00:25:34.290 --> 00:25:37.620 align:middle line:84%
So Darwin knew that there
were problems with his theory.

00:25:37.620 --> 00:25:39.480 align:middle line:84%
And Darwin, as I
mentioned earlier,

00:25:39.480 --> 00:25:41.610 align:middle line:84%
never claimed that his
theory would be the theory

00:25:41.610 --> 00:25:42.550 align:middle line:90%
to end all theories.

00:25:42.550 --> 00:25:43.350 align:middle line:90%
It was a bridge.

00:25:43.350 --> 00:25:45.090 align:middle line:84%
It was intended as
a stepping stone

00:25:45.090 --> 00:25:47.370 align:middle line:84%
to get us started,
to get us from where

00:25:47.370 --> 00:25:50.640 align:middle line:84%
we had been on a path of
a new way of thinking.

00:25:50.640 --> 00:25:54.810 align:middle line:84%
And I'd like to share with you
one more time Darwin's own very

00:25:54.810 --> 00:25:59.460 align:middle line:84%
complex language, where he is
expressing, in his own book,

00:25:59.460 --> 00:26:03.150 align:middle line:84%
his doubts of how
his theory might not

00:26:03.150 --> 00:26:07.260 align:middle line:84%
support very complex organs
within the body or organisms

00:26:07.260 --> 00:26:08.520 align:middle line:90%
themselves.

00:26:08.520 --> 00:26:11.910 align:middle line:84%
So I'm going to read
directly from his quote,

00:26:11.910 --> 00:26:13.800 align:middle line:84%
so that I get every
word just right.

00:26:13.800 --> 00:26:17.490 align:middle line:10%
When Darwin was talking
about the improbability

00:26:17.490 --> 00:26:21.390 align:middle line:10%
of very complex
organs just happening

00:26:21.390 --> 00:26:24.660 align:middle line:10%
through evolution alone
and how improbable

00:26:24.660 --> 00:26:25.740 align:middle line:10%
that actually sounds--

00:26:25.740 --> 00:26:27.630 align:middle line:10%
I just want you to
hear his words--

00:26:27.630 --> 00:26:32.340 align:middle line:10%
he said, "to suppose that
the eye, for example,

00:26:32.340 --> 00:26:36.000 align:middle line:10%
with all its
inimitable contrivances

00:26:36.000 --> 00:26:39.540 align:middle line:10%
for adjusting the focus
to different distances,

00:26:39.540 --> 00:26:41.700 align:middle line:10%
for admitting different
amounts of light,

00:26:41.700 --> 00:26:44.130 align:middle line:10%
and for the correction of
spherical and chromatic

00:26:44.130 --> 00:26:46.860 align:middle line:10%
aberration, could
have been formed

00:26:46.860 --> 00:26:50.280 align:middle line:10%
by natural selection
seems, I freely

00:26:50.280 --> 00:26:55.060 align:middle line:10%
confess, absurd in the
highest possible degree."

00:26:55.060 --> 00:26:56.760 align:middle line:90%
End of quote.

00:26:56.760 --> 00:26:58.770 align:middle line:90%
These are Darwin's own words.

00:26:58.770 --> 00:27:02.640 align:middle line:84%
So he's saying very honestly,
as a scientist, he's saying,

00:27:02.640 --> 00:27:04.920 align:middle line:90%
I know this sounds outrageous.

00:27:04.920 --> 00:27:07.590 align:middle line:84%
He said, and I even think
it sounds outrageous,

00:27:07.590 --> 00:27:10.870 align:middle line:84%
but this is the best that
we have for right now.

00:27:10.870 --> 00:27:15.390 align:middle line:84%
So when it comes to the way we
are thinking about ourselves

00:27:15.390 --> 00:27:18.900 align:middle line:84%
and one another, I wanted
to give you some insights

00:27:18.900 --> 00:27:23.440 align:middle line:84%
into the most controversial
facets of Darwin's work

00:27:23.440 --> 00:27:25.260 align:middle line:90%
and what it means.

00:27:25.260 --> 00:27:29.040 align:middle line:84%
For me, one of the problems that
scientists are finding today,

00:27:29.040 --> 00:27:31.050 align:middle line:90%
it's all about context.

00:27:31.050 --> 00:27:33.210 align:middle line:84%
It's all about
the bigger picture

00:27:33.210 --> 00:27:36.430 align:middle line:84%
of where the little
discoveries actually fit.

00:27:36.430 --> 00:27:39.300 align:middle line:84%
Let me just give you an
example of I mean by that.

00:27:39.300 --> 00:27:43.050 align:middle line:84%
If you and I are walking
through a field somewhere

00:27:43.050 --> 00:27:46.240 align:middle line:84%
and we look on the ground and
we find a key, a car key, and we

00:27:46.240 --> 00:27:47.620 align:middle line:90%
pick it up.

00:27:47.620 --> 00:27:50.920 align:middle line:84%
From that car key,
unless you know more

00:27:50.920 --> 00:27:53.410 align:middle line:84%
about a bigger context,
you don't really

00:27:53.410 --> 00:27:54.850 align:middle line:90%
know much about that key.

00:27:54.850 --> 00:27:57.760 align:middle line:84%
You may not be able to tell
what kind of a car it goes to,

00:27:57.760 --> 00:28:00.130 align:middle line:84%
what year or make or
model that car is.

00:28:00.130 --> 00:28:02.440 align:middle line:84%
You don't know how long
that key has been there.

00:28:02.440 --> 00:28:06.250 align:middle line:84%
And you'll never know only
by looking at this key.

00:28:06.250 --> 00:28:08.500 align:middle line:84%
This is a principle that
comes up again and again

00:28:08.500 --> 00:28:10.240 align:middle line:90%
and again in science.

00:28:10.240 --> 00:28:12.086 align:middle line:84%
We find it in the
archaeological sites

00:28:12.086 --> 00:28:13.960 align:middle line:84%
and the out of place
artifacts that we talked

00:28:13.960 --> 00:28:15.880 align:middle line:90%
about earlier in this series.

00:28:15.880 --> 00:28:19.570 align:middle line:84%
If we look only at the
civilization itself,

00:28:19.570 --> 00:28:22.270 align:middle line:84%
if you look only at the
walls of an ancient temple,

00:28:22.270 --> 00:28:25.270 align:middle line:84%
if you read only the
hieroglyphs that are there,

00:28:25.270 --> 00:28:30.100 align:middle line:84%
and you expect to see from
that the big picture of who

00:28:30.100 --> 00:28:31.840 align:middle line:84%
created them and
where they came from

00:28:31.840 --> 00:28:34.335 align:middle line:84%
and why they were there, without
knowing what was happening

00:28:34.335 --> 00:28:35.710 align:middle line:84%
in the cosmos,
what was happening

00:28:35.710 --> 00:28:38.204 align:middle line:84%
in the climate, what's
happening on the Earth,

00:28:38.204 --> 00:28:40.120 align:middle line:84%
it's probably not going
to tell you the story.

00:28:40.120 --> 00:28:42.910 align:middle line:84%
The same principle
applies to human origins.

00:28:42.910 --> 00:28:46.810 align:middle line:84%
If we are looking only at
fossils in Olduvai Gorge,

00:28:46.810 --> 00:28:50.770 align:middle line:84%
or if we are looking
only at Darwin's theory

00:28:50.770 --> 00:28:54.640 align:middle line:84%
and trying to apply that
to everything that we find,

00:28:54.640 --> 00:28:59.500 align:middle line:84%
and if we're trying to take
every discovery that we find

00:28:59.500 --> 00:29:04.300 align:middle line:84%
and force it into a
preconceived idea of this tree,

00:29:04.300 --> 00:29:07.772 align:middle line:84%
we're probably not going
to find the answers

00:29:07.772 --> 00:29:08.730 align:middle line:90%
that we're looking for.

00:29:08.730 --> 00:29:12.490 align:middle line:84%
It's not going to lead us
to the place of our origin.

00:29:12.490 --> 00:29:14.690 align:middle line:84%
To do that, we've got to
look at the bigger picture.

00:29:14.690 --> 00:29:16.180 align:middle line:84%
We've got to look
at the context.

00:29:16.180 --> 00:29:18.205 align:middle line:90%
That's where human DNA comes in.

00:29:18.205 --> 00:29:22.690 align:middle line:84%
In the next episode, we'll
explore what the latest DNA

00:29:22.690 --> 00:29:25.890 align:middle line:84%
studies are now revealing
when it comes to our origin.

00:29:25.890 --> 00:29:28.510 align:middle line:84%
And while some of our questions
are going to be answered,

00:29:28.510 --> 00:29:30.220 align:middle line:84%
I have to tell you
right now, we'll

00:29:30.220 --> 00:29:33.040 align:middle line:84%
also find that the
answers that we do receive

00:29:33.040 --> 00:29:35.800 align:middle line:84%
are going to open up the door
to an even deeper mystery

00:29:35.800 --> 00:29:38.230 align:middle line:84%
and forbidden
territory when it comes

00:29:38.230 --> 00:29:40.810 align:middle line:84%
to modern science
and the human story.

00:29:40.810 --> 00:29:44.080 align:middle line:84%
Thank you for joining me for
this program today, and be sure

00:29:44.080 --> 00:29:47.080 align:middle line:84%
and tune in for our next all
new episode of "Missing Links",

00:29:47.080 --> 00:29:52.320 align:middle line:84%
the deep truth of our origin,
history, destiny, and fate.

00:29:52.320 --> 00:30:06.209 align:middle line:90%
