00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:26.260 align:middle line:90%
>> My name's Gregg Braden.

00:00:26.260 --> 00:00:28.750 align:middle line:84%
I'd like to welcome you to
this very special presentation

00:00:28.750 --> 00:00:32.020 align:middle line:84%
of "Missing Links, The
Deep Truth of our Origin,

00:00:32.020 --> 00:00:34.960 align:middle line:90%
History, Destiny, and Fate."

00:00:34.960 --> 00:00:36.970 align:middle line:84%
In our last episode,
we discovered

00:00:36.970 --> 00:00:40.630 align:middle line:84%
that we are literally wired
for healing and longevity,

00:00:40.630 --> 00:00:44.350 align:middle line:84%
and that the real life examples
that bring those miraculous

00:00:44.350 --> 00:00:47.410 align:middle line:84%
potentials into our lives,
you had the opportunity

00:00:47.410 --> 00:00:50.020 align:middle line:84%
to see through the
people who demonstrated

00:00:50.020 --> 00:00:51.550 align:middle line:90%
for us in their lives.

00:00:51.550 --> 00:00:53.470 align:middle line:84%
In this episode,
we're going to take

00:00:53.470 --> 00:00:56.200 align:middle line:84%
this idea of personal
healing and resilience

00:00:56.200 --> 00:00:59.860 align:middle line:84%
to the next level of
community and healing.

00:00:59.860 --> 00:01:03.100 align:middle line:84%
And we're going to begin
with an ancient map of time

00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:05.830 align:middle line:84%
and the guidelines
that it offers us today

00:01:05.830 --> 00:01:10.620 align:middle line:84%
as to how we can thrive
in our time of extremes.

00:01:10.620 --> 00:01:13.830 align:middle line:84%
Early in this program,
we identified the fact

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:16.920 align:middle line:84%
that we are, in fact, living
what the experts are calling

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:21.600 align:middle line:84%
a time of extremes, a
convergence of cycles that

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:24.030 align:middle line:84%
are wreaking havoc
in the way of life

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:26.130 align:middle line:84%
as we have known it in
the past, the climate

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:30.300 align:middle line:84%
cycles, the economic cycles, and
the cycles of human conflict.

00:01:30.300 --> 00:01:32.070 align:middle line:10%
And I intentionally
shared those with you

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:34.890 align:middle line:10%
earlier in the program, so
that we could refer back

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:37.530 align:middle line:10%
to those cycles in
different episodes,

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:39.780 align:middle line:10%
and this is one
of those episodes.

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:42.840 align:middle line:84%
We saw that these cycles
that are converging now,

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:44.730 align:middle line:84%
it's not the first
time it's happened.

00:01:44.730 --> 00:01:47.580 align:middle line:84%
They've converged in our
past, and that they appear

00:01:47.580 --> 00:01:51.720 align:middle line:84%
to do so on a rhythmic
basis, on a regular basis,

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:54.960 align:middle line:84%
that is approximately
every 5,000 years.

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:57.240 align:middle line:90%
Well, our ancestors knew this.

00:01:57.240 --> 00:01:58.860 align:middle line:90%
They prepared for it.

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:01.410 align:middle line:84%
The ancient astronomers,
the Mayan astronomers,

00:02:01.410 --> 00:02:06.120 align:middle line:84%
for example, they
dedicated an entire sect

00:02:06.120 --> 00:02:09.780 align:middle line:84%
of their population,
the scientists,

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:12.960 align:middle line:84%
to observing the heavens
throughout their entire

00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:16.290 align:middle line:84%
lifetimes, and recording
what they observed,

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:19.530 align:middle line:84%
and passing those observations
to the next generation

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:21.120 align:middle line:90%
and the next and the next.

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:25.200 align:middle line:84%
And in this way, they recorded
celestial events and cycles

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:27.840 align:middle line:84%
of time more
accurately in the way

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:31.854 align:middle line:84%
that we did not see again
until late in the 20th century.

00:02:31.854 --> 00:02:33.520 align:middle line:84%
And even then, it
wasn't done by people,

00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:37.775 align:middle line:84%
it was done by computers using
the data from ice cores and sea

00:02:37.775 --> 00:02:41.280 align:middle line:84%
floors to tell us what it is
that happened in the past.

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:44.250 align:middle line:84%
So I'm saying this to
you, because our ancestors

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:47.250 align:middle line:84%
knew that cycles of
change were coming.

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:50.790 align:middle line:84%
They knew that they would
live times of extremes,

00:02:50.790 --> 00:02:54.630 align:middle line:84%
because they always happen
when the cycles converge.

00:02:54.630 --> 00:02:57.660 align:middle line:84%
And because of that,
they knew that they

00:02:57.660 --> 00:03:00.810 align:middle line:84%
had the possibility
and the potential

00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:04.830 align:middle line:84%
and they had the honor of
leaving for the next generation

00:03:04.830 --> 00:03:07.260 align:middle line:84%
of people that would
come along, what

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:11.310 align:middle line:84%
they had learned in the past
generations for the cycles,

00:03:11.310 --> 00:03:17.730 align:middle line:84%
what they meant, how to navigate
these cycles in a healthy way.

00:03:17.730 --> 00:03:20.100 align:middle line:84%
Because they didn't
want to just survive

00:03:20.100 --> 00:03:23.010 align:middle line:84%
by the skin of their teeth and
get through some tough times.

00:03:23.010 --> 00:03:26.190 align:middle line:84%
They were learning
to thrive, to thrive

00:03:26.190 --> 00:03:29.040 align:middle line:90%
in the environment of a change.

00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:32.940 align:middle line:84%
And the only time that a
change becomes a problem for us

00:03:32.940 --> 00:03:35.130 align:middle line:84%
is when we're not
prepared for it.

00:03:35.130 --> 00:03:37.260 align:middle line:84%
When we see our
time of extremes,

00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:41.790 align:middle line:84%
if we cling to the
old ideas of living

00:03:41.790 --> 00:03:45.540 align:middle line:84%
and the old ideas of
what's sustainable,

00:03:45.540 --> 00:03:48.480 align:middle line:84%
and we try to implement
those in a world

00:03:48.480 --> 00:03:50.250 align:middle line:84%
where those ideas
no longer apply,

00:03:50.250 --> 00:03:52.630 align:middle line:84%
that's where the
struggle comes from.

00:03:52.630 --> 00:03:54.300 align:middle line:84%
That's where we
find the problems

00:03:54.300 --> 00:03:56.130 align:middle line:90%
in our times of extremes.

00:03:56.130 --> 00:03:57.880 align:middle line:84%
Well, I want to share
with you an example,

00:03:57.880 --> 00:04:01.770 align:middle line:84%
one of the most beautiful, one
of the clearest examples of how

00:04:01.770 --> 00:04:06.540 align:middle line:84%
our ancestors were able to
document the times of extremes,

00:04:06.540 --> 00:04:08.580 align:middle line:84%
and perhaps more
importantly, how

00:04:08.580 --> 00:04:10.860 align:middle line:84%
they were able to
share with us what

00:04:10.860 --> 00:04:13.740 align:middle line:84%
it would mean for future
generations, what to look for,

00:04:13.740 --> 00:04:17.550 align:middle line:84%
the actual markings
in time in history,

00:04:17.550 --> 00:04:20.070 align:middle line:84%
so that we would know
where we are in the cycles

00:04:20.070 --> 00:04:23.190 align:middle line:84%
and what it would take for us
in our thinking and the way

00:04:23.190 --> 00:04:25.590 align:middle line:84%
we live to get
through these cycles.

00:04:25.590 --> 00:04:29.750 align:middle line:84%
I'm talking about
the Hopi map of time.

00:04:29.750 --> 00:04:33.150 align:middle line:84%
The ancient Hopi, on the
mesas of northern Arizona

00:04:33.150 --> 00:04:39.630 align:middle line:84%
in the United States, have one
of the most continuous records

00:04:39.630 --> 00:04:42.540 align:middle line:84%
of their lineage and of their
history from their creation

00:04:42.540 --> 00:04:44.580 align:middle line:90%
story forward.

00:04:44.580 --> 00:04:48.210 align:middle line:84%
And the Hopi have,
in their homeland,

00:04:48.210 --> 00:04:49.860 align:middle line:90%
a very mysterious rock.

00:04:49.860 --> 00:04:53.580 align:middle line:84%
It's called Prophecy
Rock on the Third Mesa.

00:04:53.580 --> 00:04:57.300 align:middle line:84%
And this rock, they tell
us, even they do not

00:04:57.300 --> 00:05:00.930 align:middle line:84%
know for certain who
created the hieroglyphs that

00:05:00.930 --> 00:05:01.860 align:middle line:90%
were on this rock.

00:05:01.860 --> 00:05:05.130 align:middle line:84%
They don't know the
exact person that did it,

00:05:05.130 --> 00:05:07.620 align:middle line:84%
but they have a pretty good
idea of when it happened.

00:05:07.620 --> 00:05:09.630 align:middle line:84%
And they have a really
good idea of what

00:05:09.630 --> 00:05:11.950 align:middle line:90%
this rock is saying to them.

00:05:11.950 --> 00:05:14.250 align:middle line:84%
So what I'd like to do
is share this with you

00:05:14.250 --> 00:05:17.606 align:middle line:84%
and some very rare images that
we don't get to see very often.

00:05:17.606 --> 00:05:19.230 align:middle line:84%
What you're seeing
on your screen right

00:05:19.230 --> 00:05:24.000 align:middle line:84%
now is the major portion
of Prophecy Rock.

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:28.560 align:middle line:84%
And I recognize that the
lines are a little faint.

00:05:28.560 --> 00:05:31.920 align:middle line:10%
We had the opportunity
of one of the elders

00:05:31.920 --> 00:05:36.127 align:middle line:10%
to take a piece of chalk
and trace through the lines

00:05:36.127 --> 00:05:38.460 align:middle line:10%
that you're seeing, so that
the cameras could photograph

00:05:38.460 --> 00:05:40.620 align:middle line:10%
these a little bit better.

00:05:40.620 --> 00:05:42.600 align:middle line:84%
And I'm going to do
this with a computer.

00:05:42.600 --> 00:05:46.380 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to use a computer
to trace across the lines,

00:05:46.380 --> 00:05:49.200 align:middle line:84%
so that you can
see on your screen

00:05:49.200 --> 00:05:53.110 align:middle line:84%
precisely the timelines
that we're talking about.

00:05:53.110 --> 00:05:57.990 align:middle line:84%
So what the Hopi say is at the
end of the last great cycle

00:05:57.990 --> 00:06:01.320 align:middle line:84%
of change, what's called
a great world age,

00:06:01.320 --> 00:06:07.830 align:middle line:84%
a 5,000-year cycle that is
one fifth of the greater

00:06:07.830 --> 00:06:12.450 align:middle line:84%
26,000-year cycle that's called
precession of the equinoxes.

00:06:12.450 --> 00:06:15.840 align:middle line:84%
So at the end of that
last 5,000-year cycle,

00:06:15.840 --> 00:06:20.070 align:middle line:84%
those who had come before them
their ancestors created this

00:06:20.070 --> 00:06:21.010 align:middle line:90%
map.

00:06:21.010 --> 00:06:23.730 align:middle line:84%
And it was a map that
told them two things.

00:06:23.730 --> 00:06:26.340 align:middle line:84%
It told them when
the cycle ended.

00:06:26.340 --> 00:06:29.070 align:middle line:84%
It told them what they
could expect to happen--

00:06:29.070 --> 00:06:33.390 align:middle line:84%
big things, landmarks,
milestones of time

00:06:33.390 --> 00:06:35.040 align:middle line:90%
as they would go through--

00:06:35.040 --> 00:06:39.510 align:middle line:84%
and it would tell them
how to think and live

00:06:39.510 --> 00:06:43.170 align:middle line:84%
both on the inner world as
well as the outer world,

00:06:43.170 --> 00:06:45.480 align:middle line:84%
so they would successfully
thrive as they

00:06:45.480 --> 00:06:47.610 align:middle line:90%
go through the next change.

00:06:47.610 --> 00:06:50.370 align:middle line:84%
And they tell us that change
is the change that we're

00:06:50.370 --> 00:06:52.150 align:middle line:90%
experiencing right now.

00:06:52.150 --> 00:06:54.330 align:middle line:84%
So this Hopi map
of time has been

00:06:54.330 --> 00:06:55.830 align:middle line:90%
preserved for a very long time.

00:06:55.830 --> 00:06:58.950 align:middle line:84%
And they said they preserved
it for us, for you and me,

00:06:58.950 --> 00:07:02.790 align:middle line:84%
so that we can benefit
from their wisdom

00:07:02.790 --> 00:07:05.130 align:middle line:84%
and do it today when
we need it the most.

00:07:05.130 --> 00:07:07.730 align:middle line:84%
So what is this map
of time telling us?

00:07:07.730 --> 00:07:10.430 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to begin on the
left-hand side of the screen.

00:07:10.430 --> 00:07:14.420 align:middle line:84%
And what you see is that
I've traced out two paths.

00:07:14.420 --> 00:07:17.640 align:middle line:84%
And what the Hopi say is at
the end of the last cycle,

00:07:17.640 --> 00:07:20.820 align:middle line:84%
the people of this world
were given the opportunity

00:07:20.820 --> 00:07:24.150 align:middle line:84%
to walk two paths
that would carry them

00:07:24.150 --> 00:07:27.480 align:middle line:84%
to the end of their time
into the next cycle, where

00:07:27.480 --> 00:07:29.460 align:middle line:90%
we are right now.

00:07:29.460 --> 00:07:33.180 align:middle line:10%
What makes it so interesting
is that in the beginning,

00:07:33.180 --> 00:07:34.680 align:middle line:10%
both paths looked very similar.

00:07:34.680 --> 00:07:36.810 align:middle line:10%
And you can see that when
you look on the rock.

00:07:36.810 --> 00:07:39.681 align:middle line:10%
They both look very similar,
just in different places.

00:07:39.681 --> 00:07:42.630 align:middle line:10%
But if you look
closely, however, you'll

00:07:42.630 --> 00:07:46.440 align:middle line:10%
see that the people that
are depicted on each path

00:07:46.440 --> 00:07:49.120 align:middle line:10%
are telling a very
different story.

00:07:49.120 --> 00:07:50.970 align:middle line:84%
If you look at the
upper path, for example,

00:07:50.970 --> 00:07:54.090 align:middle line:84%
there are people there, people
living on the upper path.

00:07:54.090 --> 00:07:57.390 align:middle line:84%
Their heads are not
connected to their bodies.

00:07:57.390 --> 00:08:00.360 align:middle line:84%
And what the Hopi
elders say is that these

00:08:00.360 --> 00:08:03.570 align:middle line:84%
are the people who live in
this time, the people that

00:08:03.570 --> 00:08:07.350 align:middle line:84%
walk that path that do
not know themselves.

00:08:07.350 --> 00:08:09.769 align:middle line:84%
Their heads are not
connected to their bodies,

00:08:09.769 --> 00:08:11.310 align:middle line:84%
because they don't
know who they are.

00:08:11.310 --> 00:08:14.070 align:middle line:90%
They've lost themselves.

00:08:14.070 --> 00:08:16.260 align:middle line:84%
And if you look
closely at this path,

00:08:16.260 --> 00:08:19.680 align:middle line:84%
you see that while it begins
in a very similar fashion

00:08:19.680 --> 00:08:21.900 align:middle line:84%
to the one below, as
the path progresses,

00:08:21.900 --> 00:08:23.640 align:middle line:90%
it begins to change.

00:08:23.640 --> 00:08:25.110 align:middle line:90%
And look at what happens.

00:08:25.110 --> 00:08:28.080 align:middle line:84%
It begins to get a little
jagged, a little rough.

00:08:28.080 --> 00:08:31.080 align:middle line:84%
It begins to get
steep and an incline.

00:08:31.080 --> 00:08:34.340 align:middle line:84%
And if you look closely,
the path ends abruptly.

00:08:34.340 --> 00:08:35.640 align:middle line:90%
It goes nowhere.

00:08:35.640 --> 00:08:38.760 align:middle line:90%
The path just stops.

00:08:38.760 --> 00:08:40.679 align:middle line:84%
But if you look
at the lower path,

00:08:40.679 --> 00:08:43.620 align:middle line:84%
it, again, looks very
similar to the one above it.

00:08:43.620 --> 00:08:46.040 align:middle line:84%
It looks smooth and
relatively even.

00:08:46.040 --> 00:08:48.630 align:middle line:84%
The difference is,
it continues that way

00:08:48.630 --> 00:08:51.510 align:middle line:84%
throughout the
entire hieroglyph.

00:08:51.510 --> 00:08:55.710 align:middle line:84%
And along the lower path, there
are people depicted as well.

00:08:55.710 --> 00:08:57.300 align:middle line:90%
There is an elderly person.

00:08:57.300 --> 00:08:59.340 align:middle line:84%
And we know this
person is elderly,

00:08:59.340 --> 00:09:02.430 align:middle line:84%
because the person is
leaning over, hunched,

00:09:02.430 --> 00:09:06.600 align:middle line:84%
leaning on a cane, which
is a sign of advanced age.

00:09:06.600 --> 00:09:09.930 align:middle line:84%
We also know that food
is plentiful on the lower

00:09:09.930 --> 00:09:12.030 align:middle line:84%
path, because right
behind the person

00:09:12.030 --> 00:09:15.000 align:middle line:84%
is a stock of corn
that is growing,

00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:18.330 align:middle line:84%
and that is a sign that food
is abundant on this path.

00:09:18.330 --> 00:09:22.300 align:middle line:84%
You don't see any evidence
of that on the path above.

00:09:22.300 --> 00:09:24.810 align:middle line:10%
So right off, we're seeing a
distinction between these two

00:09:24.810 --> 00:09:26.130 align:middle line:10%
paths.

00:09:26.130 --> 00:09:28.050 align:middle line:10%
Now, there is a
third path as well

00:09:28.050 --> 00:09:29.382 align:middle line:10%
that may not be as evident.

00:09:29.382 --> 00:09:31.590 align:middle line:84%
And I'm going to trace it
out for you on your screen.

00:09:31.590 --> 00:09:35.010 align:middle line:84%
It's the green vertical line
that connects the two existing

00:09:35.010 --> 00:09:36.330 align:middle line:90%
paths.

00:09:36.330 --> 00:09:40.050 align:middle line:84%
That line, the Hopis say,
marks a point in time

00:09:40.050 --> 00:09:43.200 align:middle line:84%
that they call the
point of no return.

00:09:43.200 --> 00:09:47.640 align:middle line:84%
And for them, that point of
no return was the year 1998.

00:09:47.640 --> 00:09:53.430 align:middle line:84%
In 1998, the Hopi sent the
eldest elder of the Hopi nation

00:09:53.430 --> 00:09:56.850 align:middle line:84%
to the United Nations
to deliver the message

00:09:56.850 --> 00:10:00.150 align:middle line:84%
that this map has left for
the people of the Earth.

00:10:00.150 --> 00:10:05.130 align:middle line:84%
And what he said is in 1998,
that we are now living,

00:10:05.130 --> 00:10:09.730 align:middle line:84%
this moment in the map of
time, the point of no return.

00:10:09.730 --> 00:10:11.910 align:middle line:84%
That while in the
past, it's always

00:10:11.910 --> 00:10:15.570 align:middle line:84%
been possible to choose between
the upper and lower path--

00:10:15.570 --> 00:10:17.850 align:middle line:84%
and truthfully, we
can always choose--

00:10:17.850 --> 00:10:22.170 align:middle line:84%
from 1998 on, it becomes much
more difficult to choose.

00:10:22.170 --> 00:10:24.480 align:middle line:84%
So that was the time,
that was the warning, that

00:10:24.480 --> 00:10:27.900 align:middle line:84%
was the message that was
delivered to the United Nations

00:10:27.900 --> 00:10:30.850 align:middle line:90%
by the Hopi nation in 1998.

00:10:30.850 --> 00:10:33.455 align:middle line:84%
And to help them know where
they were on this map,

00:10:33.455 --> 00:10:37.560 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to invite you to look
at the image one more time.

00:10:37.560 --> 00:10:40.710 align:middle line:84%
And on the lower
path, what you see

00:10:40.710 --> 00:10:46.830 align:middle line:84%
are three circles that
straddle this lower path.

00:10:46.830 --> 00:10:51.420 align:middle line:84%
The first one on the left is
what the Hopi call the First

00:10:51.420 --> 00:10:54.810 align:middle line:90%
Great Shaking of the Earth.

00:10:54.810 --> 00:10:57.840 align:middle line:84%
They said, between the time
of the last 5,000-year cycle

00:10:57.840 --> 00:11:00.870 align:middle line:84%
beginning and when it ends,
the people of the Earth will go

00:11:00.870 --> 00:11:03.360 align:middle line:84%
through these three
great shakings.

00:11:03.360 --> 00:11:06.660 align:middle line:84%
And the first shaking they
say is the First World War.

00:11:06.660 --> 00:11:08.640 align:middle line:90%
It's already happened.

00:11:08.640 --> 00:11:11.280 align:middle line:84%
The second shaking,
you see right next to

00:11:11.280 --> 00:11:14.990 align:middle line:84%
that, you probably can guess,
is the Second World War.

00:11:14.990 --> 00:11:18.920 align:middle line:84%
And then we see the vertical
line, the point of no return.

00:11:18.920 --> 00:11:25.286 align:middle line:84%
And to the right of 1998, we
see the Third Great Shaking.

00:11:25.286 --> 00:11:27.990 align:middle line:84%
And when I asked the
elders, I asked them,

00:11:27.990 --> 00:11:30.074 align:middle line:84%
I said, does that mean
that we have another war?

00:11:30.074 --> 00:11:31.240 align:middle line:90%
What does that shaking mean?

00:11:31.240 --> 00:11:33.510 align:middle line:90%
And they said, we don't know.

00:11:33.510 --> 00:11:35.550 align:middle line:84%
Our ancestors could
never tell us.

00:11:35.550 --> 00:11:38.190 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't mean that
there necessarily

00:11:38.190 --> 00:11:40.530 align:middle line:90%
is a war between nations.

00:11:40.530 --> 00:11:43.500 align:middle line:90%
It can be a conflict in beliefs.

00:11:43.500 --> 00:11:46.380 align:middle line:84%
It can be a conflict
of ideas and ideology.

00:11:46.380 --> 00:11:48.820 align:middle line:84%
It could be a
conflict of religion.

00:11:48.820 --> 00:11:50.130 align:middle line:90%
It could be a war.

00:11:50.130 --> 00:11:52.110 align:middle line:84%
But they said, the
truth is, we don't know.

00:11:52.110 --> 00:11:57.000 align:middle line:84%
It's something to watch out
for in this time after 1998

00:11:57.000 --> 00:12:00.930 align:middle line:84%
before the end of the
close of this next cycle.

00:12:00.930 --> 00:12:03.900 align:middle line:90%
So what does this mean for us?

00:12:03.900 --> 00:12:06.150 align:middle line:90%
It's giving us indications.

00:12:06.150 --> 00:12:09.140 align:middle line:10%
If you could see further
down on this map,

00:12:09.140 --> 00:12:10.770 align:middle line:10%
you would actually
see the hieroglyphs

00:12:10.770 --> 00:12:12.180 align:middle line:10%
that identify those circles.

00:12:12.180 --> 00:12:15.060 align:middle line:10%
You would see the
swastika, for example,

00:12:15.060 --> 00:12:18.780 align:middle line:10%
and the sign of the Rising
Sun, Germany and Japan,

00:12:18.780 --> 00:12:20.770 align:middle line:10%
underneath the
World War II cycle.

00:12:20.770 --> 00:12:23.070 align:middle line:10%
And you say, how did they know?

00:12:23.070 --> 00:12:25.789 align:middle line:84%
How did they know, thousands of
years ago, what kind of symbols

00:12:25.789 --> 00:12:27.330 align:middle line:84%
would represent
what's happening now?

00:12:27.330 --> 00:12:31.170 align:middle line:10%
Well, this is part of
the mystery of cycles.

00:12:31.170 --> 00:12:34.320 align:middle line:84%
We begin to open to
the possibilities

00:12:34.320 --> 00:12:37.560 align:middle line:84%
of what is called
fractal time, the fact

00:12:37.560 --> 00:12:41.100 align:middle line:84%
that time and history repeats
itself again and again.

00:12:41.100 --> 00:12:43.320 align:middle line:84%
This is the wisdom
that our ancestors

00:12:43.320 --> 00:12:47.550 align:middle line:84%
tap into in their time, and
still do today, that is largely

00:12:47.550 --> 00:12:49.470 align:middle line:90%
discounted by modern science.

00:12:49.470 --> 00:12:51.310 align:middle line:84%
And I want to take
this to the next step.

00:12:51.310 --> 00:12:52.350 align:middle line:90%
This is the map.

00:12:52.350 --> 00:12:53.910 align:middle line:84%
It's telling us
what we can expect.

00:12:53.910 --> 00:12:55.890 align:middle line:84%
It's telling us
where we are now.

00:12:55.890 --> 00:12:57.990 align:middle line:84%
Wouldn't do us any
good if we didn't

00:12:57.990 --> 00:12:59.184 align:middle line:90%
know what to do about it.

00:12:59.184 --> 00:13:00.600 align:middle line:84%
So now I'm going
to share with you

00:13:00.600 --> 00:13:02.880 align:middle line:90%
another image of the same rock.

00:13:02.880 --> 00:13:05.362 align:middle line:90%
And you can see it now.

00:13:05.362 --> 00:13:07.320 align:middle line:84%
And on this image-- it's
a little bit different

00:13:07.320 --> 00:13:08.820 align:middle line:90%
perspective--

00:13:08.820 --> 00:13:12.870 align:middle line:84%
you can see where the upper path
ends abruptly and goes nowhere.

00:13:12.870 --> 00:13:15.570 align:middle line:84%
You can also see-- and this is
where the elder has traced out

00:13:15.570 --> 00:13:17.370 align:middle line:90%
the images with the chalk--

00:13:17.370 --> 00:13:20.730 align:middle line:84%
the lower image, it
reaches a corner,

00:13:20.730 --> 00:13:24.330 align:middle line:84%
which is the edge of the
rock, but it doesn't stop.

00:13:24.330 --> 00:13:25.200 align:middle line:90%
It continues.

00:13:25.200 --> 00:13:28.740 align:middle line:84%
It goes around that
edge, and it keeps going.

00:13:28.740 --> 00:13:32.640 align:middle line:84%
They tell us that that edge
is our time of extremes.

00:13:32.640 --> 00:13:35.790 align:middle line:84%
That edge is where
we are right now.

00:13:35.790 --> 00:13:39.690 align:middle line:84%
And that the path that will
carry us gracefully and allow

00:13:39.690 --> 00:13:44.200 align:middle line:84%
us to thrive with food into
advanced age across that path

00:13:44.200 --> 00:13:46.400 align:middle line:90%
is the lower path.

00:13:46.400 --> 00:13:49.150 align:middle line:84%
So when I had the opportunity
to meet with one of the Hopi

00:13:49.150 --> 00:13:51.970 align:middle line:84%
elders, one of the
eldest elders who has

00:13:51.970 --> 00:13:53.815 align:middle line:90%
passed and is no longer with us.

00:13:53.815 --> 00:13:55.390 align:middle line:84%
Now, I'm not sharing
his name, and I

00:13:55.390 --> 00:13:58.657 align:middle line:84%
don't mean to be mysterious,
but in honor of their tradition,

00:13:58.657 --> 00:14:01.240 align:middle line:84%
they asked that we not say the
name of someone who has passed,

00:14:01.240 --> 00:14:04.390 align:middle line:84%
because it keeps calling
the spirit back to us.

00:14:04.390 --> 00:14:08.050 align:middle line:84%
So I'm simply going to say a
recent elder elder who shared

00:14:08.050 --> 00:14:10.160 align:middle line:90%
this wisdom with us today.

00:14:10.160 --> 00:14:12.160 align:middle line:90%
And what he said is this.

00:14:12.160 --> 00:14:15.400 align:middle line:84%
The qualities of both of
these paths, the upper path,

00:14:15.400 --> 00:14:18.640 align:middle line:84%
he said, the people that
walk the upper path,

00:14:18.640 --> 00:14:23.514 align:middle line:84%
they live in the world of
comfort, greed, and profit.

00:14:23.514 --> 00:14:25.180 align:middle line:84%
And I looked at that,
and I thought, ah,

00:14:25.180 --> 00:14:26.380 align:middle line:90%
that's interesting.

00:14:26.380 --> 00:14:27.970 align:middle line:90%
Profit, especially.

00:14:27.970 --> 00:14:30.330 align:middle line:84%
I said, does that mean that
we shouldn't make money?

00:14:30.330 --> 00:14:31.871 align:middle line:84%
Does that mean profit
is a bad thing?

00:14:31.871 --> 00:14:34.630 align:middle line:84%
He said, no, no, it's
not that kind of profit.

00:14:34.630 --> 00:14:36.280 align:middle line:90%
It's not about money.

00:14:36.280 --> 00:14:38.770 align:middle line:84%
He said this, is the
kind of profit where

00:14:38.770 --> 00:14:42.790 align:middle line:84%
one person or a group
of people benefit

00:14:42.790 --> 00:14:46.410 align:middle line:84%
at the expense and the
suffering of another.

00:14:46.410 --> 00:14:50.620 align:middle line:84%
Whenever we do better at the
expense of someone else hurting

00:14:50.620 --> 00:14:54.220 align:middle line:84%
or doing worse, that's
the kind of profit

00:14:54.220 --> 00:14:56.680 align:middle line:84%
that is on the path
that leads nowhere.

00:14:56.680 --> 00:14:58.630 align:middle line:84%
It's the path that
ends abruptly.

00:14:58.630 --> 00:15:01.780 align:middle line:84%
It's a path that cannot possibly
carry us through our time

00:15:01.780 --> 00:15:05.380 align:middle line:84%
of extremes, because it
is not a sustainable path.

00:15:05.380 --> 00:15:07.660 align:middle line:84%
And I said, well, what is
this lower path all about?

00:15:07.660 --> 00:15:10.150 align:middle line:84%
What are the qualities
of the lower path?

00:15:10.150 --> 00:15:13.930 align:middle line:84%
The lower path, and probably
is no surprise to you,

00:15:13.930 --> 00:15:19.150 align:middle line:84%
is based upon a different kind
of quality, love, strength,

00:15:19.150 --> 00:15:20.450 align:middle line:90%
and balance.

00:15:20.450 --> 00:15:22.700 align:middle line:90%
Love, strength, and balance.

00:15:22.700 --> 00:15:26.470 align:middle line:84%
And if you look closely at each
of these qualities, what you'll

00:15:26.470 --> 00:15:29.890 align:middle line:84%
find is that comfort,
greed, profit, those are

00:15:29.890 --> 00:15:32.020 align:middle line:90%
things that we do in the world.

00:15:32.020 --> 00:15:34.150 align:middle line:84%
Love, strength,
and balance, those

00:15:34.150 --> 00:15:37.540 align:middle line:84%
are things that we
become in our lives.

00:15:37.540 --> 00:15:41.030 align:middle line:84%
And this is the essence of many
of the indigenous traditions,

00:15:41.030 --> 00:15:44.740 align:middle line:84%
including the Hopi, many
of the ancient traditions.

00:15:44.740 --> 00:15:48.220 align:middle line:84%
And now what you know
from quantum physics,

00:15:48.220 --> 00:15:50.920 align:middle line:84%
from the hologram, from
entanglement, from the photon

00:15:50.920 --> 00:15:54.040 align:middle line:84%
experiments, all the things
that we have talked about,

00:15:54.040 --> 00:15:56.410 align:middle line:84%
it all boils down to
this simple principle.

00:15:56.410 --> 00:15:59.710 align:middle line:84%
We must become, in
our lives, the things

00:15:59.710 --> 00:16:02.290 align:middle line:84%
that we choose to
experience in our world.

00:16:02.290 --> 00:16:05.170 align:middle line:84%
We want a world of love,
strength, and balance,

00:16:05.170 --> 00:16:07.990 align:middle line:84%
we must become those
things in our lives,

00:16:07.990 --> 00:16:10.660 align:middle line:84%
and live them every moment to
the best of our ability day in

00:16:10.660 --> 00:16:13.390 align:middle line:84%
and day out, not be out
on the street angrily

00:16:13.390 --> 00:16:15.912 align:middle line:84%
protesting that we want
love, strength, and balance.

00:16:15.912 --> 00:16:16.870 align:middle line:90%
It's counterproductive.

00:16:16.870 --> 00:16:18.400 align:middle line:90%
It makes no sense.

00:16:18.400 --> 00:16:20.182 align:middle line:90%
Now you begin to understand why.

00:16:20.182 --> 00:16:21.640 align:middle line:84%
So I wanted to
share this with you.

00:16:21.640 --> 00:16:24.650 align:middle line:90%
This is the Hopi perspective.

00:16:24.650 --> 00:16:27.580 align:middle line:84%
Well, this Hopi wisdom, it
should come as no surprise,

00:16:27.580 --> 00:16:29.680 align:middle line:84%
intuitively, we look
at this, we say, well,

00:16:29.680 --> 00:16:33.480 align:middle line:84%
of course, that
makes total sense.

00:16:33.480 --> 00:16:36.040 align:middle line:90%
Intuitively, it makes sense.

00:16:36.040 --> 00:16:40.300 align:middle line:84%
This all goes back to the
ideas of Charles Darwin.

00:16:40.300 --> 00:16:43.570 align:middle line:84%
So once again we're
hearkening back

00:16:43.570 --> 00:16:47.200 align:middle line:84%
to these ideas in the late
1800s and early 1900s.

00:16:47.200 --> 00:16:48.940 align:middle line:84%
Charles Darwin's
ideas of what it

00:16:48.940 --> 00:16:51.430 align:middle line:84%
takes to get through
the difficult times

00:16:51.430 --> 00:16:54.670 align:middle line:84%
are in direct
competition with what

00:16:54.670 --> 00:16:55.900 align:middle line:90%
the Hopi have just told us.

00:16:55.900 --> 00:16:59.880 align:middle line:84%
They're in direct opposition,
and they're about competition.

00:16:59.880 --> 00:17:02.290 align:middle line:84%
And just to refresh your
memory, what I'd like to do,

00:17:02.290 --> 00:17:05.050 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to read Darwin's
words to you once again.

00:17:05.050 --> 00:17:08.224 align:middle line:84%
And I mentioned this a
couple of segments earlier.

00:17:08.224 --> 00:17:12.880 align:middle line:84%
And what I said is that Darwin
went into the natural world,

00:17:12.880 --> 00:17:17.710 align:middle line:84%
and he observed in nature very
specific forms of life-- ants,

00:17:17.710 --> 00:17:19.030 align:middle line:90%
birds--

00:17:19.030 --> 00:17:20.619 align:middle line:90%
and the way that they behaved.

00:17:20.619 --> 00:17:22.930 align:middle line:84%
And what Darwin said,
his insight, he said,

00:17:22.930 --> 00:17:26.410 align:middle line:84%
ah what I'm seeing
here in this place

00:17:26.410 --> 00:17:28.780 align:middle line:84%
on the Earth in
this moment in time

00:17:28.780 --> 00:17:32.650 align:middle line:84%
must be a representative,
a little piece

00:17:32.650 --> 00:17:37.450 align:middle line:84%
of a bigger law that applies
to all life everywhere

00:17:37.450 --> 00:17:38.330 align:middle line:90%
all the time.

00:17:38.330 --> 00:17:39.280 align:middle line:84%
And as I mentioned
earlier, I think

00:17:39.280 --> 00:17:40.720 align:middle line:90%
this is where he went wrong.

00:17:40.720 --> 00:17:43.660 align:middle line:84%
This is a dangerous,
dangerous way to think.

00:17:43.660 --> 00:17:46.930 align:middle line:84%
Let me read you
Darwin's precise words,

00:17:46.930 --> 00:17:51.700 align:middle line:84%
so you can see his thinking
and why this is so dangerous.

00:17:51.700 --> 00:17:55.120 align:middle line:84%
In his book "Origin of
Species," what Darwin said,

00:17:55.120 --> 00:17:58.180 align:middle line:84%
he believed that
life was a struggle.

00:17:58.180 --> 00:18:00.460 align:middle line:10%
And while he believed
that on the one hand,

00:18:00.460 --> 00:18:04.270 align:middle line:10%
he also prefaces his
own words by telling us

00:18:04.270 --> 00:18:07.760 align:middle line:10%
what he's about to say to us
doesn't make a lot of sense.

00:18:07.760 --> 00:18:09.760 align:middle line:84%
So I want you to see
what he's saying,

00:18:09.760 --> 00:18:11.050 align:middle line:90%
and just hear his own words.

00:18:11.050 --> 00:18:16.670 align:middle line:84%
Darwin said, quote, it may
not be a logical deduction,

00:18:16.670 --> 00:18:21.170 align:middle line:84%
but it is far more satisfactory
to look at instincts,

00:18:21.170 --> 00:18:25.280 align:middle line:84%
such as ants making
slaves of other ants

00:18:25.280 --> 00:18:30.010 align:middle line:84%
as small examples of
one general law leading

00:18:30.010 --> 00:18:32.620 align:middle line:84%
to the advancement
of all beings.

00:18:32.620 --> 00:18:36.490 align:middle line:84%
And that law is the law that
says we should multiply.

00:18:36.490 --> 00:18:40.020 align:middle line:10%
We should vary, let
the strongest live,

00:18:40.020 --> 00:18:42.060 align:middle line:10%
and the weakest die.

00:18:42.060 --> 00:18:46.260 align:middle line:10%
Let the strongest live
and the weakest die.

00:18:46.260 --> 00:18:49.200 align:middle line:84%
This is such a
dangerous way to think.

00:18:49.200 --> 00:18:51.650 align:middle line:84%
And it's dangerous for
a couple of reasons,

00:18:51.650 --> 00:18:53.970 align:middle line:84%
particularly because of
when it was introduced,

00:18:53.970 --> 00:18:56.370 align:middle line:90%
late 1800s, early 1900s.

00:18:56.370 --> 00:18:58.500 align:middle line:84%
This is when the great
wars were being fought.

00:18:58.500 --> 00:19:03.270 align:middle line:10%
This is when the thinking
that was being created of how

00:19:03.270 --> 00:19:05.160 align:middle line:10%
people relate to other people.

00:19:05.160 --> 00:19:07.170 align:middle line:10%
Darwin is telling
us that when he

00:19:07.170 --> 00:19:10.784 align:middle line:10%
saw the ants capture
another colony of ants,

00:19:10.784 --> 00:19:11.700 align:middle line:10%
they didn't kill them.

00:19:11.700 --> 00:19:13.650 align:middle line:84%
They enslaved them
and made them work.

00:19:13.650 --> 00:19:16.209 align:middle line:84%
He said that is a reflection
of the general law.

00:19:16.209 --> 00:19:18.000 align:middle line:84%
Let the strongest live
and the weakest die.

00:19:18.000 --> 00:19:21.750 align:middle line:84%
This later became
survival of the fittest.

00:19:21.750 --> 00:19:23.940 align:middle line:84%
Darwin called it survival
of the strongest.

00:19:23.940 --> 00:19:25.570 align:middle line:84%
And he said this
in his own words.

00:19:25.570 --> 00:19:27.150 align:middle line:90%
And I want you to know that.

00:19:27.150 --> 00:19:28.380 align:middle line:90%
So I'm not mincing words.

00:19:28.380 --> 00:19:30.570 align:middle line:90%
Survival of the strongest.

00:19:30.570 --> 00:19:34.770 align:middle line:84%
The ideas of the great genocides
and the great suffering

00:19:34.770 --> 00:19:39.600 align:middle line:84%
of the late 1800s, the 1900s
throughout the 20th century

00:19:39.600 --> 00:19:41.850 align:middle line:84%
are directly linked
to this thinking.

00:19:41.850 --> 00:19:44.370 align:middle line:10%
If you look at the manifestos
and you look at the writings

00:19:44.370 --> 00:19:47.640 align:middle line:10%
and you look at the lengths
of the greatest acts of war,

00:19:47.640 --> 00:19:51.270 align:middle line:10%
aggression, and genocide,
the philosophies

00:19:51.270 --> 00:19:55.080 align:middle line:10%
are directly based
and sometimes quoted.

00:19:55.080 --> 00:19:57.270 align:middle line:10%
I'm not saying
Darwin intended this.

00:19:57.270 --> 00:20:00.120 align:middle line:10%
But this is how a dangerous
thinking like this

00:20:00.120 --> 00:20:03.000 align:middle line:10%
can be misinterpreted
and applied

00:20:03.000 --> 00:20:05.760 align:middle line:10%
in horrible ways that
create tremendous suffering

00:20:05.760 --> 00:20:07.000 align:middle line:10%
in our world.

00:20:07.000 --> 00:20:09.480 align:middle line:84%
And it's based on
something that's not true.

00:20:09.480 --> 00:20:11.790 align:middle line:84%
This is a false
assumption of science,

00:20:11.790 --> 00:20:13.350 align:middle line:90%
and that's the good news.

00:20:13.350 --> 00:20:16.650 align:middle line:84%
That's the good news I want
to share with you right now.

00:20:16.650 --> 00:20:19.020 align:middle line:84%
The best science
of the modern world

00:20:19.020 --> 00:20:22.590 align:middle line:84%
is now telling us one
of the deepest truths,

00:20:22.590 --> 00:20:24.900 align:middle line:84%
I believe, that has the
greatest impact, the greatest

00:20:24.900 --> 00:20:29.010 align:middle line:84%
consequence on our world as a
whole, on your life and my life

00:20:29.010 --> 00:20:30.290 align:middle line:90%
individually.

00:20:30.290 --> 00:20:32.700 align:middle line:10%
If you think back to the
inverted pyramid that

00:20:32.700 --> 00:20:36.180 align:middle line:10%
began this entire series,
it was in episode number

00:20:36.180 --> 00:20:40.690 align:middle line:10%
two, when we talked about the
false assumptions of science.

00:20:40.690 --> 00:20:43.260 align:middle line:10%
Assumption number six, at
the top of the pyramid,

00:20:43.260 --> 00:20:45.750 align:middle line:10%
was that the fundamental
law of nature

00:20:45.750 --> 00:20:49.740 align:middle line:10%
is based upon competition,
conflict, and struggle.

00:20:49.740 --> 00:20:52.200 align:middle line:10%
And that comes directly
from Darwin's ideas

00:20:52.200 --> 00:20:54.680 align:middle line:10%
that were embraced,
and not questioned,

00:20:54.680 --> 00:20:57.030 align:middle line:10%
in late 1800s and early 1900s.

00:20:57.030 --> 00:21:01.680 align:middle line:84%
It is deeply ingrained as the
fabric of our very society.

00:21:01.680 --> 00:21:03.720 align:middle line:84%
The economic system
that's collapsing

00:21:03.720 --> 00:21:07.500 align:middle line:84%
right now, the way that we're
dealing with differences

00:21:07.500 --> 00:21:11.460 align:middle line:84%
between nations unsuccessfully,
the way that we are trying

00:21:11.460 --> 00:21:16.080 align:middle line:84%
to share resources, food, water,
oil, energy, communications,

00:21:16.080 --> 00:21:19.740 align:middle line:84%
defense, all of these things
are based in this idea

00:21:19.740 --> 00:21:21.470 align:middle line:90%
of survival of the strongest.

00:21:21.470 --> 00:21:25.140 align:middle line:84%
And in our time of
extremes, as our ideas

00:21:25.140 --> 00:21:26.880 align:middle line:84%
and what we think
about ourselves

00:21:26.880 --> 00:21:29.970 align:middle line:84%
and our beliefs are being
pushed to the limits,

00:21:29.970 --> 00:21:33.450 align:middle line:84%
because the extremes are
changing the environment where

00:21:33.450 --> 00:21:36.270 align:middle line:84%
they've been applied, the ideas
have been applied in the past,

00:21:36.270 --> 00:21:37.830 align:middle line:84%
all those ideas
are breaking down.

00:21:37.830 --> 00:21:39.030 align:middle line:90%
They're not working.

00:21:39.030 --> 00:21:42.480 align:middle line:84%
They can't work, because
they're not true.

00:21:42.480 --> 00:21:44.430 align:middle line:84%
They're based in
false assumptions.

00:21:44.430 --> 00:21:49.140 align:middle line:84%
And this idea of cooperation
versus competition, this

00:21:49.140 --> 00:21:49.940 align:middle line:90%
is key.

00:21:49.940 --> 00:21:50.880 align:middle line:84%
So I want to share
this with you.

00:21:50.880 --> 00:21:52.463 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to take a
minute to do this.

00:21:52.463 --> 00:21:53.830 align:middle line:90%
I think it's important.

00:21:53.830 --> 00:21:56.070 align:middle line:84%
The best science
of the modern world

00:21:56.070 --> 00:22:01.230 align:middle line:84%
is now telling us that, in fact,
the fundamental rule of nature

00:22:01.230 --> 00:22:04.020 align:middle line:84%
is cooperation and
what biologists

00:22:04.020 --> 00:22:09.700 align:middle line:84%
call mutual aid, not competition
and conflict and survival.

00:22:09.700 --> 00:22:12.900 align:middle line:84%
Now, we all know that
competition, conflict,

00:22:12.900 --> 00:22:14.320 align:middle line:90%
and survival, they're a fact.

00:22:14.320 --> 00:22:15.120 align:middle line:90%
They happen.

00:22:15.120 --> 00:22:17.110 align:middle line:90%
We see them all the time.

00:22:17.110 --> 00:22:19.650 align:middle line:84%
They're not the
fundamental rule.

00:22:19.650 --> 00:22:22.980 align:middle line:84%
And to the degree that we
see violence, competition,

00:22:22.980 --> 00:22:26.610 align:middle line:84%
and conflict, to the degree
that we see that happening, what

00:22:26.610 --> 00:22:32.130 align:middle line:84%
we're actually witnessing is
how far we or any population

00:22:32.130 --> 00:22:37.470 align:middle line:84%
has strayed from the harmony
of the deepest truth of nature.

00:22:37.470 --> 00:22:40.050 align:middle line:84%
It tells us the more
violence and conflict we see,

00:22:40.050 --> 00:22:42.370 align:middle line:84%
it tells us how far we've
strayed from the natural laws

00:22:42.370 --> 00:22:43.170 align:middle line:90%
of this world.

00:22:43.170 --> 00:22:45.570 align:middle line:84%
And if we believe
that we somehow

00:22:45.570 --> 00:22:47.670 align:middle line:84%
are separate from
nature, that we

00:22:47.670 --> 00:22:50.610 align:middle line:84%
don't have to abide by the
fundamental laws of nature

00:22:50.610 --> 00:22:53.280 align:middle line:84%
that all the forms
of life abide by,

00:22:53.280 --> 00:22:55.860 align:middle line:84%
that is the opening
to our demise.

00:22:55.860 --> 00:22:58.340 align:middle line:84%
We've seen this happen in the
past with other civilizations

00:22:58.340 --> 00:22:59.500 align:middle line:90%
and other cultures.

00:22:59.500 --> 00:23:02.170 align:middle line:84%
There's a powerful lesson
that we can learn from this.

00:23:02.170 --> 00:23:05.850 align:middle line:84%
And our own science, the best
science of the modern world,

00:23:05.850 --> 00:23:07.930 align:middle line:84%
gives us the reason to
change our thinking.

00:23:07.930 --> 00:23:09.720 align:middle line:90%
We don't have to do it on faith.

00:23:09.720 --> 00:23:11.490 align:middle line:90%
We don't have to do it on trust.

00:23:11.490 --> 00:23:14.400 align:middle line:84%
Because we've asked
science to tell us

00:23:14.400 --> 00:23:16.620 align:middle line:84%
the deep truths of
our lives, now science

00:23:16.620 --> 00:23:17.760 align:middle line:90%
is revealing those truths.

00:23:17.760 --> 00:23:20.340 align:middle line:84%
The question is, will
we embrace those truths?

00:23:20.340 --> 00:23:24.797 align:middle line:84%
Well, here is the truth of what
Darwin said about cooperation.

00:23:24.797 --> 00:23:26.130 align:middle line:90%
There was a study that was done.

00:23:26.130 --> 00:23:31.650 align:middle line:84%
Over 400 papers were
written, asking the question

00:23:31.650 --> 00:23:34.200 align:middle line:90%
about competition and conflict.

00:23:34.200 --> 00:23:36.660 align:middle line:84%
Specifically, the
question was this.

00:23:36.660 --> 00:23:42.450 align:middle line:84%
What is the optimum amount of
competition in any situation,

00:23:42.450 --> 00:23:44.760 align:middle line:90%
in any place?

00:23:44.760 --> 00:23:46.380 align:middle line:84%
And when I say
competition, I just

00:23:46.380 --> 00:23:47.963 align:middle line:84%
want be very clear
of what I'm saying.

00:23:47.963 --> 00:23:51.950 align:middle line:84%
I'm not talking about a
friendly game of soccer or chess

00:23:51.950 --> 00:23:54.700 align:middle line:84%
or checkers at the
family dinner table.

00:23:54.700 --> 00:23:56.700 align:middle line:84%
When we say competition,
this is what biologists

00:23:56.700 --> 00:23:59.700 align:middle line:90%
call violent competition, OK?

00:23:59.700 --> 00:24:02.220 align:middle line:84%
What is the optimum amount
of violent competition

00:24:02.220 --> 00:24:03.480 align:middle line:90%
in the world?

00:24:03.480 --> 00:24:07.180 align:middle line:84%
Over 400 studies came
up with the same answer.

00:24:07.180 --> 00:24:11.610 align:middle line:84%
And once again for clarity, I
want to read to you directly

00:24:11.610 --> 00:24:13.590 align:middle line:90%
the results of that study.

00:24:13.590 --> 00:24:17.250 align:middle line:10%
In his book entitled
"No Contest, The Case

00:24:17.250 --> 00:24:21.600 align:middle line:10%
Against Competition,"
Alfie Kohn wrote, quote,

00:24:21.600 --> 00:24:26.730 align:middle line:10%
the ideal amount of violent
competition in any environment,

00:24:26.730 --> 00:24:28.620 align:middle line:10%
in the classroom,
in the workplace,

00:24:28.620 --> 00:24:32.010 align:middle line:10%
in the family in the
playing field, is none.

00:24:32.010 --> 00:24:35.850 align:middle line:10%
He said, violent
competition always, always,

00:24:35.850 --> 00:24:38.290 align:middle line:10%
always is destructive.

00:24:38.290 --> 00:24:40.950 align:middle line:84%
So this is one of
the first cases.

00:24:40.950 --> 00:24:42.570 align:middle line:84%
Late in the 20th
century, this was

00:24:42.570 --> 00:24:45.540 align:middle line:84%
in the 1990s, when these
studies were published,

00:24:45.540 --> 00:24:48.120 align:middle line:84%
and they opened the
door to a possibility.

00:24:48.120 --> 00:24:51.740 align:middle line:84%
Scientists began saying,
what if we're wrong?

00:24:51.740 --> 00:24:55.260 align:middle line:84%
What if the ideas that we've
embraced about competition

00:24:55.260 --> 00:24:58.200 align:middle line:84%
and conflict that are
reflected in our economy, that

00:24:58.200 --> 00:25:01.440 align:middle line:84%
are reflected in
our defense policy,

00:25:01.440 --> 00:25:03.690 align:middle line:84%
reflected in the way we
deal with other nations,

00:25:03.690 --> 00:25:04.650 align:middle line:90%
what if they're wrong?

00:25:04.650 --> 00:25:07.920 align:middle line:84%
And that led to
even more studies.

00:25:07.920 --> 00:25:10.170 align:middle line:90%
Alfie Kohn was one of the first.

00:25:10.170 --> 00:25:14.640 align:middle line:84%
But from there, scientists began
writing about this competition.

00:25:14.640 --> 00:25:17.390 align:middle line:84%
And what they found
in the year 2008

00:25:17.390 --> 00:25:19.880 align:middle line:84%
made headlines in one
of the most prestigious

00:25:19.880 --> 00:25:21.020 align:middle line:90%
scientific journals.

00:25:21.020 --> 00:25:22.550 align:middle line:90%
It's called "New Scientist."

00:25:22.550 --> 00:25:26.120 align:middle line:84%
There was an entire issue
based upon evolution.

00:25:26.120 --> 00:25:28.280 align:middle line:90%
And once again, not my words.

00:25:28.280 --> 00:25:32.390 align:middle line:84%
I want you to hear exactly the
words, the conclusions of what

00:25:32.390 --> 00:25:34.730 align:middle line:90%
this article is saying to us.

00:25:34.730 --> 00:25:37.580 align:middle line:84%
In an article by
Michael Le Page,

00:25:37.580 --> 00:25:41.240 align:middle line:84%
it was entitled "Evolution
myths, survival of the fittest

00:25:41.240 --> 00:25:43.580 align:middle line:84%
justifies everyone
for themselves,"

00:25:43.580 --> 00:25:47.510 align:middle line:84%
the "New Scientist,"
edition April 2008.

00:25:47.510 --> 00:25:49.640 align:middle line:84%
What Michael Le
Page said is this.

00:25:49.640 --> 00:25:52.850 align:middle line:84%
He said, quote, what
we see in the wild

00:25:52.850 --> 00:25:56.390 align:middle line:84%
is not every animal
out for itself.

00:25:56.390 --> 00:26:01.080 align:middle line:84%
He said, cooperation is an
incredibly successful survival

00:26:01.080 --> 00:26:01.880 align:middle line:90%
strategy.

00:26:01.880 --> 00:26:03.380 align:middle line:84%
And then he went
on to clarify that.

00:26:03.380 --> 00:26:06.080 align:middle line:84%
He said, when
cooperation breaks down,

00:26:06.080 --> 00:26:08.600 align:middle line:90%
the results can be disastrous.

00:26:08.600 --> 00:26:09.680 align:middle line:90%
End of quote.

00:26:09.680 --> 00:26:11.930 align:middle line:84%
So what Michael Le Page is
saying in "New Scientist"

00:26:11.930 --> 00:26:14.420 align:middle line:84%
and what that scientific
thinking is now

00:26:14.420 --> 00:26:17.600 align:middle line:84%
that is willing to embrace
the facts of what we're seeing

00:26:17.600 --> 00:26:21.830 align:middle line:84%
along these lines is that
it's not every animal out

00:26:21.830 --> 00:26:22.640 align:middle line:90%
for themselves.

00:26:22.640 --> 00:26:25.130 align:middle line:84%
There is violent competition,
but that competition

00:26:25.130 --> 00:26:26.870 align:middle line:84%
is part of a higher
order that we

00:26:26.870 --> 00:26:29.090 align:middle line:84%
see in the animal
kingdom that is actually

00:26:29.090 --> 00:26:30.530 align:middle line:90%
a form of cooperation.

00:26:30.530 --> 00:26:35.390 align:middle line:84%
When we see the weakest of
one form of life succumb

00:26:35.390 --> 00:26:38.750 align:middle line:84%
to other forms of life, that
is a cooperative endeavor.

00:26:38.750 --> 00:26:42.830 align:middle line:84%
It is not animal against animal
fighting for the survival

00:26:42.830 --> 00:26:44.522 align:middle line:90%
of their lives.

00:26:44.522 --> 00:26:46.730 align:middle line:84%
The same principle now that
we're seeing in science--

00:26:46.730 --> 00:26:48.110 align:middle line:90%
this is science--

00:26:48.110 --> 00:26:52.190 align:middle line:84%
it's telling us that what we've
been thinking about our deepest

00:26:52.190 --> 00:26:55.760 align:middle line:84%
truth is not necessarily
the deepest truth.

00:26:55.760 --> 00:27:02.270 align:middle line:84%
The biology now is reflected
in the archeology of our past.

00:27:02.270 --> 00:27:03.470 align:middle line:90%
This is fascinating to me.

00:27:03.470 --> 00:27:05.030 align:middle line:90%
Let me say it again.

00:27:05.030 --> 00:27:08.480 align:middle line:84%
The biology of this
discovery is reflected

00:27:08.480 --> 00:27:11.120 align:middle line:90%
in the archeology of our past.

00:27:11.120 --> 00:27:12.670 align:middle line:90%
Here's what I mean by that.

00:27:12.670 --> 00:27:15.530 align:middle line:84%
The biology is
telling us that we

00:27:15.530 --> 00:27:19.400 align:middle line:84%
live in this world of
cooperation and mutual aid

00:27:19.400 --> 00:27:22.370 align:middle line:84%
where conflict may
occur sometimes.

00:27:22.370 --> 00:27:24.190 align:middle line:84%
Now, I'm going to
go back to some

00:27:24.190 --> 00:27:25.940 align:middle line:84%
of the archaeological
sites that we talked

00:27:25.940 --> 00:27:28.070 align:middle line:84%
about earlier in
this episode, and I'm

00:27:28.070 --> 00:27:31.310 align:middle line:84%
going to reveal something now
that we didn't talk about then,

00:27:31.310 --> 00:27:33.380 align:middle line:90%
so that we can do it right now.

00:27:33.380 --> 00:27:35.360 align:middle line:84%
There is a mystery
that scientists

00:27:35.360 --> 00:27:38.540 align:middle line:84%
have found when
they are uncovering

00:27:38.540 --> 00:27:42.620 align:middle line:84%
some of those ancient sites,
the ancient civilizations that

00:27:42.620 --> 00:27:44.800 align:middle line:90%
are older than 5,000 years.

00:27:44.800 --> 00:27:47.300 align:middle line:84%
So remember, 5,000
years is when we're

00:27:47.300 --> 00:27:48.620 align:middle line:90%
taught civilization began.

00:27:48.620 --> 00:27:51.080 align:middle line:84%
I shared with you
earlier in this program

00:27:51.080 --> 00:27:52.640 align:middle line:84%
the evidence that
tells us there's

00:27:52.640 --> 00:27:55.040 align:middle line:90%
another cycle before that.

00:27:55.040 --> 00:27:57.650 align:middle line:84%
So I'm going to share with you
some of the hallmarks of this

00:27:57.650 --> 00:28:01.610 align:middle line:84%
previous 5,000-year cycle,
whether we're talking about

00:28:01.610 --> 00:28:04.550 align:middle line:84%
Gobekli Tepe, or whether
we're talking about the Gulf

00:28:04.550 --> 00:28:08.430 align:middle line:84%
of Khambhat off the coast of
India under 120 feet of water,

00:28:08.430 --> 00:28:10.850 align:middle line:84%
or whether we're talking
about Catalhoyuk--

00:28:10.850 --> 00:28:12.440 align:middle line:84%
now, didn't I
identify specifically,

00:28:12.440 --> 00:28:16.070 align:middle line:84%
did I mention it in Turkey
along with Gobekli Tepe--

00:28:16.070 --> 00:28:18.830 align:middle line:84%
or whether we're talking
about Caral, the oldest

00:28:18.830 --> 00:28:21.550 align:middle line:84%
technologically advanced
civilization in all

00:28:21.550 --> 00:28:24.110 align:middle line:84%
the Americas that's now
located in northern Peru,

00:28:24.110 --> 00:28:26.150 align:middle line:84%
there's a common theme
through all of these.

00:28:26.150 --> 00:28:27.740 align:middle line:90%
And the theme is amazing.

00:28:27.740 --> 00:28:31.850 align:middle line:84%
Every one of these sites, there
is no evidence of any weapons

00:28:31.850 --> 00:28:34.910 align:middle line:84%
that has been discovered in
any of these ancient sites

00:28:34.910 --> 00:28:38.220 align:middle line:84%
or others within this
5,000-year window.

00:28:38.220 --> 00:28:41.330 align:middle line:84%
There is no evidence
of mass war.

00:28:41.330 --> 00:28:43.340 align:middle line:90%
No evidence of mass graves.

00:28:43.340 --> 00:28:46.250 align:middle line:90%
No walls to protect the homes.

00:28:46.250 --> 00:28:49.370 align:middle line:84%
No walls protect
the communities.

00:28:49.370 --> 00:28:51.410 align:middle line:84%
No evidence of mutilated
bodies that you

00:28:51.410 --> 00:28:54.410 align:middle line:84%
would expect to see
from armies facing off

00:28:54.410 --> 00:28:57.680 align:middle line:84%
against other armies and the
result of ancient warfare.

00:28:57.680 --> 00:29:02.930 align:middle line:84%
It simply does not exist in
this block of archaeological

00:29:02.930 --> 00:29:08.750 align:middle line:84%
discoveries, this 5,000-year
block before our cycle began.

00:29:08.750 --> 00:29:10.280 align:middle line:90%
Why is that?

00:29:10.280 --> 00:29:13.640 align:middle line:84%
If we are to believe what
the texts themselves tell us,

00:29:13.640 --> 00:29:18.980 align:middle line:84%
they say that before we began
our cycle of war, darkness,

00:29:18.980 --> 00:29:23.330 align:middle line:84%
and violence 5,000 years
ago that now has brought us

00:29:23.330 --> 00:29:25.580 align:middle line:84%
to the point of extremes
where we are now,

00:29:25.580 --> 00:29:27.890 align:middle line:84%
the cycle before was a
very different cycle.

00:29:27.890 --> 00:29:31.310 align:middle line:84%
It was a golden age of
peace and cooperation.

00:29:31.310 --> 00:29:33.080 align:middle line:84%
And that the cycles
alternate one

00:29:33.080 --> 00:29:36.200 align:middle line:84%
after another, war,
peace, war and peace,

00:29:36.200 --> 00:29:38.540 align:middle line:84%
triggered by the climate
change and the competition

00:29:38.540 --> 00:29:41.420 align:middle line:84%
for resources when
that is needed.

00:29:41.420 --> 00:29:42.890 align:middle line:90%
What does that mean for us?

00:29:42.890 --> 00:29:46.340 align:middle line:84%
We've just crossed that
5,000-year mark, all right?

00:29:46.340 --> 00:29:47.910 align:middle line:90%
We are now into the next cycle.

00:29:47.910 --> 00:29:49.940 align:middle line:84%
The question is,
will we perpetuate

00:29:49.940 --> 00:29:54.350 align:middle line:84%
the cycle of war and violence
from our last 5,000 years?

00:29:54.350 --> 00:29:58.520 align:middle line:84%
Or will we choose a golden
age of peace and cooperation

00:29:58.520 --> 00:30:00.110 align:middle line:84%
based on the deepest
truth of nature,

00:30:00.110 --> 00:30:03.710 align:middle line:84%
and the harmony that
we know is possible?

00:30:03.710 --> 00:30:05.550 align:middle line:84%
In our next episode,
we're going to take

00:30:05.550 --> 00:30:09.570 align:middle line:84%
this idea of localized
change and peace and harmony

00:30:09.570 --> 00:30:11.640 align:middle line:84%
to another level,
to a global level.

00:30:11.640 --> 00:30:14.730 align:middle line:84%
And in doing so, we'll discover
the revolutionary science

00:30:14.730 --> 00:30:18.420 align:middle line:84%
that tells us that our
personal choices, what's

00:30:18.420 --> 00:30:22.020 align:middle line:84%
happening in here, is the
key to global cooperation

00:30:22.020 --> 00:30:25.080 align:middle line:84%
and lasting peace in
the world out there.

00:30:25.080 --> 00:30:26.835 align:middle line:84%
Thank you for joining
me for this program.

00:30:26.835 --> 00:30:30.900 align:middle line:84%
And be sure to tune in for
our next all-new episode

00:30:30.900 --> 00:30:34.020 align:middle line:84%
of "Missing Links, The
Deep Truth of our Origin,

00:30:34.020 --> 00:30:37.310 align:middle line:90%
History, Destiny, and Fate."

00:30:37.310 --> 00:30:54.460 align:middle line:90%
