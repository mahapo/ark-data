00:00:24.791 --> 00:00:27.290 align:middle line:84%
>> My name's Gregg Braden and
I'd like to welcome me to this

00:00:27.290 --> 00:00:30.080 align:middle line:84%
very special presentation
of "Missing Links",

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:34.420 align:middle line:84%
the deep truth of our origin,
history, destiny, and fate.

00:00:34.420 --> 00:00:36.970 align:middle line:10%
In our last episode
we discovered

00:00:36.970 --> 00:00:41.000 align:middle line:10%
that the mysterious
fusion of ancient DNA

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:44.720 align:middle line:10%
is what makes humans possible
and it's what sets us apart

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:46.790 align:middle line:10%
from all other life.

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:49.850 align:middle line:84%
We also discovered that
it was the precision,

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:54.530 align:middle line:84%
the extraordinary functions and
the timing of this fusion, that

00:00:54.530 --> 00:00:58.080 align:middle line:84%
suggests something much more
than nature, natural evolution,

00:00:58.080 --> 00:00:58.880 align:middle line:90%
were involved.

00:00:58.880 --> 00:01:01.180 align:middle line:90%
Something else had to happen.

00:01:01.180 --> 00:01:06.200 align:middle line:10%
This is where the real science
ends because the answer to what

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:09.740 align:middle line:10%
made that fusion happen cannot
be scientifically proven,

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:11.060 align:middle line:10%
at least yet.

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:13.820 align:middle line:10%
But what we do know
with absolute certainty

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:15.890 align:middle line:10%
is that because of
our genetic makeup,

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:18.830 align:middle line:10%
because that fusion happened
and we have human chromosome

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:24.110 align:middle line:10%
number 2, we are endowed with
extraordinary capabilities

00:01:24.110 --> 00:01:26.720 align:middle line:10%
that we can awaken
when we choose,

00:01:26.720 --> 00:01:28.710 align:middle line:10%
when we want, on demand.

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:31.760 align:middle line:84%
And in this episode we're going
to reveal those potentials

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:35.390 align:middle line:84%
and discover what it is
to be fully enabled, fully

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:37.550 align:middle line:90%
capacitated as a human.

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:42.200 align:middle line:84%
So one of the key tenets of
Darwin's theory of evolution

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:45.950 align:middle line:84%
was proposed by a colleague
of his, Alfred Wallace.

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:47.600 align:middle line:84%
During the same
time, Wallace was

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:50.655 align:middle line:84%
a supporter and a
researcher and a scientist.

00:01:50.655 --> 00:01:52.280 align:middle line:84%
He believed in the
theory of evolution,

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:54.650 align:middle line:84%
and he actually
collaborated with Darwin

00:01:54.650 --> 00:01:56.510 align:middle line:90%
to create this theory.

00:01:56.510 --> 00:01:59.610 align:middle line:84%
And the tenant that
Alfred Wallace put forward

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:03.260 align:middle line:84%
that has become a key facet
of evolutionary theory

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:04.820 align:middle line:90%
is simply this--

00:02:04.820 --> 00:02:09.120 align:middle line:84%
nature only gives us the things
that we need when we need them.

00:02:09.120 --> 00:02:11.960 align:middle line:84%
In other words,
nature only gives us

00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:14.450 align:middle line:84%
the ability to warm our
bodies when we have cooler

00:02:14.450 --> 00:02:16.390 align:middle line:90%
temperatures that require that.

00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:21.860 align:middle line:84%
Or, nature only gives us the
ability to see in the dark

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:25.850 align:middle line:84%
when we have no light
when we need that ability.

00:02:25.850 --> 00:02:29.630 align:middle line:10%
I'd like to read to you
precisely what Alfred Wallace

00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:32.395 align:middle line:10%
wrote, because it lays the
foundation for where we're

00:02:32.395 --> 00:02:34.520 align:middle line:10%
going to go and what the
discoveries are telling us

00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:35.660 align:middle line:10%
right now.

00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:39.620 align:middle line:10%
In his final chapter of the
book entitled "Contributions

00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:41.300 align:middle line:10%
to the Theory of
Natural Selection,"

00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:44.270 align:middle line:10%
it was published in
1870, Alfred Wallace

00:02:44.270 --> 00:02:50.210 align:middle line:10%
said this, quote, "Nature
never over-endows a species

00:02:50.210 --> 00:02:53.300 align:middle line:10%
beyond the needs of
everyday existence."

00:02:53.300 --> 00:02:55.310 align:middle line:10%
Nature never
over-endows a species

00:02:55.310 --> 00:02:56.960 align:middle line:10%
beyond the needs of
everyday existence,

00:02:56.960 --> 00:02:58.580 align:middle line:10%
and that's where the problem is.

00:02:58.580 --> 00:03:01.610 align:middle line:84%
The problem is, we
are all over-endowed.

00:03:01.610 --> 00:03:03.682 align:middle line:84%
We are over-endowed
as a species.

00:03:03.682 --> 00:03:04.640 align:middle line:90%
Here's your reason why.

00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:08.360 align:middle line:84%
We showed up, as we
said, 200,000 years ago.

00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:10.760 align:middle line:84%
And when we showed
up, we already

00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:13.640 align:middle line:84%
had the advanced features
that set us apart

00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:15.860 align:middle line:90%
from all other life intact.

00:03:15.860 --> 00:03:17.990 align:middle line:84%
We were fully enabled,
fully capacitated.

00:03:17.990 --> 00:03:19.730 align:middle line:84%
They didn't develop
slowly, gradually

00:03:19.730 --> 00:03:21.410 align:middle line:90%
over long periods of time.

00:03:21.410 --> 00:03:24.920 align:middle line:84%
For example, when we showed
up 200,000 years ago,

00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:29.090 align:middle line:84%
we had a brain that was
50% larger than our nearest

00:03:29.090 --> 00:03:31.130 align:middle line:84%
primate relatives
that we were supposed

00:03:31.130 --> 00:03:33.980 align:middle line:84%
to have evolved from
gradually, slowly

00:03:33.980 --> 00:03:35.990 align:middle line:90%
over long periods of time.

00:03:35.990 --> 00:03:38.210 align:middle line:90%
We had evolved speech.

00:03:38.210 --> 00:03:41.420 align:middle line:84%
We had advanced characteristics
of opposing digits-- thumb

00:03:41.420 --> 00:03:44.390 align:middle line:84%
and finger-- that allows us
to do all kinds of things.

00:03:44.390 --> 00:03:48.650 align:middle line:84%
We had complex
language, and we had

00:03:48.650 --> 00:03:52.610 align:middle line:84%
what is called an
extended neural network--

00:03:52.610 --> 00:03:56.270 align:middle line:84%
an advanced and
extended neural network.

00:03:56.270 --> 00:03:58.520 align:middle line:84%
That's where we're going
with this whole thing.

00:03:58.520 --> 00:04:01.590 align:middle line:84%
Our advanced, extended
neural network,

00:04:01.590 --> 00:04:04.760 align:middle line:84%
it gives us abilities that
no other form of life--

00:04:04.760 --> 00:04:08.000 align:middle line:84%
at least no other form of
life that we know of today

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:08.870 align:middle line:90%
on Earth--

00:04:08.870 --> 00:04:09.850 align:middle line:90%
have.

00:04:09.850 --> 00:04:11.120 align:middle line:90%
We have them.

00:04:11.120 --> 00:04:13.310 align:middle line:84%
And when we begin
to embrace what

00:04:13.310 --> 00:04:17.060 align:middle line:84%
it is those features are
and what they tell us,

00:04:17.060 --> 00:04:21.110 align:middle line:84%
it opens the door to an entire
new realm of possibilities,

00:04:21.110 --> 00:04:23.180 align:middle line:84%
and what it means
to be fully enabled,

00:04:23.180 --> 00:04:27.500 align:middle line:84%
fully capacitated as
a human in this world.

00:04:27.500 --> 00:04:31.655 align:middle line:84%
So I'm going to begin with
a relatively new discovery.

00:04:31.655 --> 00:04:33.770 align:middle line:90%
It was made only in 1991.

00:04:33.770 --> 00:04:37.490 align:middle line:84%
It's a discovery that
involves the human heart.

00:04:37.490 --> 00:04:41.900 align:middle line:84%
Now this is interesting
unto itself because we--

00:04:41.900 --> 00:04:46.280 align:middle line:84%
our society-- have been
doing heart transplants

00:04:46.280 --> 00:04:50.060 align:middle line:84%
from one human to
another since the 1960s,

00:04:50.060 --> 00:04:52.700 align:middle line:84%
and they have been
relatively successful.

00:04:52.700 --> 00:04:55.220 align:middle line:84%
They don't happen
necessarily every day,

00:04:55.220 --> 00:04:56.720 align:middle line:84%
but there are an
average of maybe

00:04:56.720 --> 00:05:00.020 align:middle line:84%
5,000 heart transplants
per year in the world,

00:05:00.020 --> 00:05:02.630 align:middle line:84%
and they are
relatively successful.

00:05:02.630 --> 00:05:07.220 align:middle line:84%
And scientists attribute
that success to their belief

00:05:07.220 --> 00:05:09.110 align:middle line:84%
that we pretty much
know everything there

00:05:09.110 --> 00:05:11.150 align:middle line:90%
is to know about the heart.

00:05:11.150 --> 00:05:13.820 align:middle line:84%
And it's for that reason
that a discovery--

00:05:13.820 --> 00:05:15.980 align:middle line:84%
such as the one I'm
about to share with you,

00:05:15.980 --> 00:05:19.340 align:middle line:90%
made relatively late in 1991--

00:05:19.340 --> 00:05:20.540 align:middle line:90%
is now on the radar.

00:05:20.540 --> 00:05:23.840 align:middle line:84%
How could we have gone so
long without recognizing what

00:05:23.840 --> 00:05:26.180 align:middle line:90%
this discovery is telling us?

00:05:26.180 --> 00:05:29.670 align:middle line:84%
Well, the discovery itself
is that scientists now

00:05:29.670 --> 00:05:33.450 align:middle line:84%
recognize we have
within our hearts

00:05:33.450 --> 00:05:39.600 align:middle line:84%
about 40,000 specialized
cells concentrated

00:05:39.600 --> 00:05:42.520 align:middle line:84%
in a very precise
way in our hearts.

00:05:42.520 --> 00:05:46.650 align:middle line:84%
The specialized cells, they
are called sensory neurites.

00:05:46.650 --> 00:05:49.890 align:middle line:84%
Sensory neurites, that's
a very technical term.

00:05:49.890 --> 00:05:52.500 align:middle line:84%
It means they're essentially
brain-like cells,

00:05:52.500 --> 00:05:53.910 align:middle line:90%
but they're not in our brain.

00:05:53.910 --> 00:05:55.550 align:middle line:90%
They're in our heart.

00:05:55.550 --> 00:05:59.790 align:middle line:84%
And that they are in our heart,
concentrated in such a way,

00:05:59.790 --> 00:06:03.660 align:middle line:84%
that scientists now call
these cells in our heart

00:06:03.660 --> 00:06:06.820 align:middle line:90%
the little brain in the heart.

00:06:06.820 --> 00:06:08.700 align:middle line:84%
One of the things that
is so amazing to me

00:06:08.700 --> 00:06:12.240 align:middle line:84%
is the name of the man
who found the cells.

00:06:12.240 --> 00:06:14.024 align:middle line:90%
His last name's Armour.

00:06:14.024 --> 00:06:17.520 align:middle line:90%
Armour-- this is love in French.

00:06:17.520 --> 00:06:21.120 align:middle line:84%
So when I think
about karmic destiny

00:06:21.120 --> 00:06:22.919 align:middle line:84%
and maybe what this
man's karma was--

00:06:22.919 --> 00:06:24.960 align:middle line:84%
at the age of five years
old if someone asked him

00:06:24.960 --> 00:06:26.460 align:middle line:84%
what he was going to do
for a living he would say,

00:06:26.460 --> 00:06:28.168 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to make a
discovery of a heart.

00:06:28.168 --> 00:06:29.490 align:middle line:90%
It's in my name.

00:06:29.490 --> 00:06:33.930 align:middle line:84%
But this kind of
discovery is so powerful.

00:06:33.930 --> 00:06:37.590 align:middle line:84%
And what it is that he found--
these 40,000 cells in the human

00:06:37.590 --> 00:06:38.490 align:middle line:90%
heart--

00:06:38.490 --> 00:06:40.480 align:middle line:90%
because this isn't a metaphor.

00:06:40.480 --> 00:06:41.580 align:middle line:90%
This is literal.

00:06:41.580 --> 00:06:46.950 align:middle line:84%
These cells in our heart,
they learn independently

00:06:46.950 --> 00:06:50.880 align:middle line:84%
of cells in our brain, of
the neurons in our brain.

00:06:50.880 --> 00:06:55.230 align:middle line:84%
They think independently
of the cells in our brain.

00:06:55.230 --> 00:06:59.890 align:middle line:84%
They feel independently
of the cells in our brain.

00:06:59.890 --> 00:07:02.310 align:middle line:84%
So what we're finding
now is that we

00:07:02.310 --> 00:07:06.660 align:middle line:84%
have a form of intelligence
focused in the heart that

00:07:06.660 --> 00:07:10.140 align:middle line:84%
can function completely
separately from what

00:07:10.140 --> 00:07:12.030 align:middle line:90%
we typically know in the brain.

00:07:12.030 --> 00:07:15.150 align:middle line:84%
And as you'll see in a moment,
they can also be married.

00:07:15.150 --> 00:07:18.340 align:middle line:84%
They can be harmonized
with the human brain.

00:07:18.340 --> 00:07:21.150 align:middle line:84%
The heart and the brain may be
harmonized in a very precise

00:07:21.150 --> 00:07:23.070 align:middle line:90%
way to awaken these functions.

00:07:23.070 --> 00:07:25.170 align:middle line:84%
Before we get into
that, I just want

00:07:25.170 --> 00:07:27.990 align:middle line:84%
to share with you
some examples of how

00:07:27.990 --> 00:07:32.630 align:middle line:84%
real these cells and
their function really are.

00:07:32.630 --> 00:07:35.740 align:middle line:84%
It is very common for medical
doctors and scientists--

00:07:35.740 --> 00:07:37.710 align:middle line:84%
they would go to
conferences and they

00:07:37.710 --> 00:07:40.020 align:middle line:84%
would share with other
scientists and researchers

00:07:40.020 --> 00:07:42.990 align:middle line:84%
and doctors their experiences
in heart research,

00:07:42.990 --> 00:07:46.200 align:middle line:84%
or for the doctors
sometimes, heart transplants.

00:07:46.200 --> 00:07:50.580 align:middle line:84%
And it was common
for stories to arise

00:07:50.580 --> 00:07:54.780 align:middle line:84%
where a recipient
of a heart would--

00:07:54.780 --> 00:07:59.490 align:middle line:84%
a successful recipient of a
heart would begin to assume

00:07:59.490 --> 00:08:01.620 align:middle line:84%
different characteristics
of personality

00:08:01.620 --> 00:08:04.320 align:middle line:84%
and different qualities
of the way they thought

00:08:04.320 --> 00:08:06.630 align:middle line:84%
about themselves and
viewed life after the heart

00:08:06.630 --> 00:08:10.590 align:middle line:84%
transplant from what they had
before the heart transplant.

00:08:10.590 --> 00:08:12.420 align:middle line:84%
So one of the first
stories, for example,

00:08:12.420 --> 00:08:15.990 align:middle line:84%
it was a woman that
received the heart--

00:08:15.990 --> 00:08:20.820 align:middle line:84%
she knew it was from a male, and
typically the donor information

00:08:20.820 --> 00:08:22.800 align:middle line:84%
is not shared with
the recipient.

00:08:22.800 --> 00:08:26.580 align:middle line:84%
Typically, that information
is sealed in the courts.

00:08:26.580 --> 00:08:27.690 align:middle line:90%
It can be discovered.

00:08:27.690 --> 00:08:29.900 align:middle line:84%
And there are ways to
do it, as you'll see,

00:08:29.900 --> 00:08:32.260 align:middle line:90%
but it's not commonly done.

00:08:32.260 --> 00:08:35.309 align:middle line:84%
So the woman's transplant
was successful.

00:08:35.309 --> 00:08:37.289 align:middle line:84%
And when the doctor
came to check on her

00:08:37.289 --> 00:08:39.960 align:middle line:84%
and he asked her the question,
he said, how do you feel?

00:08:39.960 --> 00:08:41.470 align:middle line:90%
She said, I feel fine.

00:08:41.470 --> 00:08:42.270 align:middle line:90%
I feel great.

00:08:42.270 --> 00:08:43.706 align:middle line:90%
She says, I'm hungry.

00:08:43.706 --> 00:08:46.080 align:middle line:84%
And the doctor said, OK, I'll
have the hospital bring you

00:08:46.080 --> 00:08:47.550 align:middle line:90%
some food.

00:08:47.550 --> 00:08:49.460 align:middle line:84%
And she immediately--
she recoiled.

00:08:49.460 --> 00:08:51.600 align:middle line:84%
She says, I don't
want hospital food.

00:08:51.600 --> 00:08:55.830 align:middle line:84%
She had very specific kinds of
food that she was asking for.

00:08:55.830 --> 00:08:57.600 align:middle line:84%
And what makes
this interesting is

00:08:57.600 --> 00:09:00.300 align:middle line:84%
that there were types of
food that she had never

00:09:00.300 --> 00:09:05.100 align:middle line:84%
eaten in her life before
she received this heart.

00:09:05.100 --> 00:09:06.900 align:middle line:84%
Very specific kinds
of food, and there

00:09:06.900 --> 00:09:09.670 align:middle line:84%
was only one place where
this food could be found,

00:09:09.670 --> 00:09:13.260 align:middle line:84%
and that is at a fast food
restaurant that is called KFC.

00:09:13.260 --> 00:09:16.950 align:middle line:84%
KFC is the only food that
would satisfy the cravings

00:09:16.950 --> 00:09:18.270 align:middle line:90%
that she was having.

00:09:18.270 --> 00:09:22.020 align:middle line:84%
Well after she was
released from the hospital,

00:09:22.020 --> 00:09:24.645 align:middle line:84%
she wanted to find out
whose heart she had.

00:09:24.645 --> 00:09:26.145 align:middle line:84%
The records were
sealed, but she did

00:09:26.145 --> 00:09:27.990 align:middle line:84%
a little personal
investigative work,

00:09:27.990 --> 00:09:29.790 align:middle line:84%
and she went through
some obituary columns.

00:09:29.790 --> 00:09:31.140 align:middle line:90%
It was a small town.

00:09:31.140 --> 00:09:35.340 align:middle line:84%
She was able to go
back, and she found

00:09:35.340 --> 00:09:37.950 align:middle line:84%
that the heart she
had received was

00:09:37.950 --> 00:09:42.060 align:middle line:84%
from a man who had died
in a motorcycle accident.

00:09:42.060 --> 00:09:44.710 align:middle line:84%
And she was able to track
down-- through the obituary--

00:09:44.710 --> 00:09:48.750 align:middle line:84%
his family, his parents, and
go to talk to them to find out

00:09:48.750 --> 00:09:52.170 align:middle line:84%
about the man's life whose
heart was now in her body.

00:09:52.170 --> 00:09:55.020 align:middle line:84%
And during that
conversation what she found

00:09:55.020 --> 00:09:58.140 align:middle line:84%
is this man's
favorite diet was KFC.

00:09:58.140 --> 00:10:01.380 align:middle line:84%
And when doctors hear
things like that they say,

00:10:01.380 --> 00:10:04.320 align:middle line:90%
huh, isn't that a coincidence.

00:10:04.320 --> 00:10:05.910 align:middle line:90%
Isn't that interesting?

00:10:05.910 --> 00:10:08.160 align:middle line:84%
And then they go on to
the next transplant.

00:10:08.160 --> 00:10:10.740 align:middle line:84%
Well this has happened
time and time again

00:10:10.740 --> 00:10:13.710 align:middle line:84%
and it has been written
off as anecdotal,

00:10:13.710 --> 00:10:19.260 align:middle line:84%
that is until one particular
story changed everything.

00:10:19.260 --> 00:10:24.180 align:middle line:84%
This is a story that happened
in a small town in the Midwest.

00:10:24.180 --> 00:10:28.050 align:middle line:84%
It was a story of
an 8-year-old girl

00:10:28.050 --> 00:10:31.940 align:middle line:84%
who received the heart of
another little girl who

00:10:31.940 --> 00:10:35.490 align:middle line:84%
was only two years older,
a 10-year-old girl.

00:10:35.490 --> 00:10:38.930 align:middle line:84%
And the heart transplant
was successful.

00:10:38.930 --> 00:10:40.430 align:middle line:84%
And typically, this
is what happens.

00:10:40.430 --> 00:10:44.840 align:middle line:84%
The doctors will try to match
the heart from the donor

00:10:44.840 --> 00:10:47.390 align:middle line:84%
to the recipient
within a range of ages

00:10:47.390 --> 00:10:48.890 align:middle line:84%
so that a very
young person isn't

00:10:48.890 --> 00:10:51.850 align:middle line:84%
getting a huge
heart or the older

00:10:51.850 --> 00:10:54.080 align:middle line:90%
heart of a very older person.

00:10:54.080 --> 00:10:56.200 align:middle line:84%
So the young girl, she
received the heart.

00:10:56.200 --> 00:10:58.820 align:middle line:84%
The transplant was
successful, but something

00:10:58.820 --> 00:11:00.980 align:middle line:90%
happened almost immediately.

00:11:00.980 --> 00:11:03.760 align:middle line:90%
She began having a dream--

00:11:03.760 --> 00:11:06.530 align:middle line:84%
a reoccurring dream--
and it was a bad dream,

00:11:06.530 --> 00:11:08.710 align:middle line:90%
so we will call it a nightmare.

00:11:08.710 --> 00:11:10.662 align:middle line:84%
And she began having
this nightmare

00:11:10.662 --> 00:11:11.870 align:middle line:90%
over and over and over again.

00:11:11.870 --> 00:11:13.200 align:middle line:84%
It wasn't every
single night, but it

00:11:13.200 --> 00:11:14.450 align:middle line:90%
was multiple times a week.

00:11:14.450 --> 00:11:18.020 align:middle line:84%
It was common enough that
her doctor recognized

00:11:18.020 --> 00:11:19.750 align:middle line:84%
that something
else was going on.

00:11:19.750 --> 00:11:23.420 align:middle line:84%
And it was something that was
out of his realm of expertise,

00:11:23.420 --> 00:11:25.610 align:middle line:84%
so the doctor said,
I've done my job.

00:11:25.610 --> 00:11:27.110 align:middle line:90%
I've given you a new heart.

00:11:27.110 --> 00:11:28.350 align:middle line:90%
It is successful.

00:11:28.350 --> 00:11:30.320 align:middle line:84%
Now you can go live
your life, and I

00:11:30.320 --> 00:11:32.960 align:middle line:84%
think you need to speak with
someone else about the dreams

00:11:32.960 --> 00:11:34.620 align:middle line:90%
that you're experiencing.

00:11:34.620 --> 00:11:37.730 align:middle line:84%
So the doctor set her
up with a psychiatrist,

00:11:37.730 --> 00:11:40.460 align:middle line:84%
and the psychiatrist
recognized immediately

00:11:40.460 --> 00:11:42.230 align:middle line:90%
this wasn't a typical dream.

00:11:42.230 --> 00:11:45.230 align:middle line:84%
It had the characteristics
of a memory.

00:11:45.230 --> 00:11:48.170 align:middle line:90%
The question is, whose memory?

00:11:48.170 --> 00:11:52.970 align:middle line:84%
Whose memory was this little
girl having night after night?

00:11:52.970 --> 00:11:56.360 align:middle line:84%
So they brought in
a forensic artist

00:11:56.360 --> 00:12:01.910 align:middle line:84%
so that the girl could detail
to the artist all of the clues

00:12:01.910 --> 00:12:04.349 align:middle line:84%
in the memories that she
was having as she was

00:12:04.349 --> 00:12:05.390 align:middle line:90%
going through this dream.

00:12:05.390 --> 00:12:08.330 align:middle line:84%
And the dream is very
similar every single night.

00:12:08.330 --> 00:12:12.350 align:middle line:84%
So the artist came in and the
girl began recounting the dream

00:12:12.350 --> 00:12:14.150 align:middle line:90%
and here's what she said.

00:12:14.150 --> 00:12:17.180 align:middle line:84%
She said the dream
always begins at night

00:12:17.180 --> 00:12:18.140 align:middle line:90%
and she's in the woods.

00:12:18.140 --> 00:12:20.570 align:middle line:84%
She's in a forested
area, and she's

00:12:20.570 --> 00:12:23.950 align:middle line:84%
running very fast because
someone is chasing her.

00:12:23.950 --> 00:12:27.110 align:middle line:84%
A man, a big man,
is chasing her.

00:12:27.110 --> 00:12:30.110 align:middle line:84%
And she's running fast in
the dark, and she trips

00:12:30.110 --> 00:12:32.720 align:middle line:90%
and she falls on the earth.

00:12:32.720 --> 00:12:36.920 align:middle line:84%
And the man catches up with her
and he begins to assault her.

00:12:36.920 --> 00:12:40.310 align:middle line:84%
He looks her in the eyes
as he is assaulting her,

00:12:40.310 --> 00:12:43.340 align:middle line:84%
and he said very
specific words to her.

00:12:43.340 --> 00:12:46.640 align:middle line:84%
She recounted these words
to the forensic artist,

00:12:46.640 --> 00:12:49.970 align:middle line:84%
and then the man killed
her, took her life.

00:12:49.970 --> 00:12:53.960 align:middle line:84%
So the artist now has
an image or rendering--

00:12:53.960 --> 00:12:56.510 align:middle line:84%
from the girl's
memory in the dreams--

00:12:56.510 --> 00:12:59.780 align:middle line:84%
of the man that she
saw, and the artist now

00:12:59.780 --> 00:13:02.630 align:middle line:84%
has the words that the
man was speaking as he

00:13:02.630 --> 00:13:03.860 align:middle line:90%
was taking this girl's life.

00:13:03.860 --> 00:13:07.160 align:middle line:10%
It was a small town,
and this information

00:13:07.160 --> 00:13:09.950 align:middle line:10%
was put out to the authorities
in an all points bulletin,

00:13:09.950 --> 00:13:12.620 align:middle line:10%
and it wasn't long before
they found the man that

00:13:12.620 --> 00:13:14.270 align:middle line:10%
matched the description.

00:13:14.270 --> 00:13:16.790 align:middle line:84%
And when they brought him
in, under questioning,

00:13:16.790 --> 00:13:19.610 align:middle line:84%
very quickly he
broke down and he

00:13:19.610 --> 00:13:23.450 align:middle line:84%
admitted that he had
actually killed the girl.

00:13:23.450 --> 00:13:25.700 align:middle line:90%
He admitted taking her life.

00:13:25.700 --> 00:13:29.540 align:middle line:84%
And here's the key, when
the questioners-- when

00:13:29.540 --> 00:13:33.110 align:middle line:84%
the interrogators were
asking him the details,

00:13:33.110 --> 00:13:38.060 align:middle line:84%
he recounted the very words to
them that the young girl had

00:13:38.060 --> 00:13:41.795 align:middle line:84%
shared with the artist that were
revealed to her in her dream.

00:13:41.795 --> 00:13:45.380 align:middle line:84%
It was based on this evidence
that the man was accused.

00:13:45.380 --> 00:13:46.490 align:middle line:90%
He was tried.

00:13:46.490 --> 00:13:49.040 align:middle line:84%
He was convicted,
sentenced, and he is now

00:13:49.040 --> 00:13:53.300 align:middle line:84%
serving time for the
murder of this young girl.

00:13:53.300 --> 00:13:57.860 align:middle line:84%
And it is only possible
because the memory

00:13:57.860 --> 00:14:01.040 align:middle line:84%
of the girl who was
killed was preserved

00:14:01.040 --> 00:14:03.230 align:middle line:84%
in the cells of her
heart that are now

00:14:03.230 --> 00:14:07.440 align:middle line:84%
in the body of the
new recipient--

00:14:07.440 --> 00:14:12.290 align:middle line:84%
the younger girl-- and she was
able to share those memories

00:14:12.290 --> 00:14:13.630 align:middle line:90%
with the authorities.

00:14:13.630 --> 00:14:16.880 align:middle line:84%
And I'm sharing this story
with you for one reason--

00:14:16.880 --> 00:14:20.570 align:middle line:84%
that is how real the
memory is in our hearts.

00:14:20.570 --> 00:14:21.980 align:middle line:90%
It's not a metaphor.

00:14:21.980 --> 00:14:26.390 align:middle line:84%
It is a literal
storage of impressions,

00:14:26.390 --> 00:14:28.990 align:middle line:90%
of memories that we all have.

00:14:28.990 --> 00:14:31.310 align:middle line:84%
But the heart has
its own language.

00:14:31.310 --> 00:14:33.050 align:middle line:84%
The heart speaks
to us in a language

00:14:33.050 --> 00:14:35.150 align:middle line:84%
different than our
mind, and we communicate

00:14:35.150 --> 00:14:38.780 align:middle line:84%
with our heart in a language
very different from our mind.

00:14:38.780 --> 00:14:41.960 align:middle line:84%
So we know now that
these specialized cells,

00:14:41.960 --> 00:14:45.230 align:middle line:84%
these sensory neurites, they
serve three functions-- they

00:14:45.230 --> 00:14:50.120 align:middle line:84%
learn, they remember, and
they think independently

00:14:50.120 --> 00:14:55.670 align:middle line:84%
of the cells in our brain,
and they can also be tuned,

00:14:55.670 --> 00:14:59.499 align:middle line:84%
harmonized, to function together
with the cells in our brain.

00:14:59.499 --> 00:15:01.040 align:middle line:84%
So I'm going to
invite you now, think

00:15:01.040 --> 00:15:02.480 align:middle line:90%
about what I'm saying to you.

00:15:02.480 --> 00:15:05.060 align:middle line:84%
Two separate organs--
a heart and a brain--

00:15:05.060 --> 00:15:08.450 align:middle line:84%
but they share an
extended neural network

00:15:08.450 --> 00:15:13.160 align:middle line:84%
that's made possible by
the genetic fusion that

00:15:13.160 --> 00:15:18.090 align:middle line:84%
happened 200,000 plus years
ago that makes us who we are.

00:15:18.090 --> 00:15:19.946 align:middle line:84%
We typically-- in
our culture, we

00:15:19.946 --> 00:15:21.320 align:middle line:84%
are very accustomed
to our brain.

00:15:21.320 --> 00:15:23.750 align:middle line:90%
Sometimes we discount our heart.

00:15:23.750 --> 00:15:25.970 align:middle line:84%
And especially for males
in the Western culture,

00:15:25.970 --> 00:15:29.139 align:middle line:84%
we've been conditioned to
discount the intuition that

00:15:29.139 --> 00:15:30.680 align:middle line:84%
comes from our heart,
and we're going

00:15:30.680 --> 00:15:33.200 align:middle line:90%
to explore in these episodes.

00:15:33.200 --> 00:15:35.030 align:middle line:84%
Other cultures do
just the opposite.

00:15:35.030 --> 00:15:38.030 align:middle line:84%
There are cultures when the
young children are born--

00:15:38.030 --> 00:15:42.020 align:middle line:84%
such as the Kogi, for
example, in South America--

00:15:42.020 --> 00:15:44.120 align:middle line:84%
their emphasis as
young children is

00:15:44.120 --> 00:15:47.510 align:middle line:84%
on developing the thinking,
the feeling, and the memory

00:15:47.510 --> 00:15:50.210 align:middle line:84%
of the heart first
for a period of years,

00:15:50.210 --> 00:15:53.090 align:middle line:84%
and then they are
immersed in the world

00:15:53.090 --> 00:15:55.460 align:middle line:84%
with all of the
physical activity

00:15:55.460 --> 00:15:57.890 align:middle line:90%
to engage their thinking mind.

00:15:57.890 --> 00:16:00.860 align:middle line:10%
But they learn about
the world of their mind

00:16:00.860 --> 00:16:02.510 align:middle line:10%
through their
heart, where we are

00:16:02.510 --> 00:16:04.460 align:middle line:10%
conditioned to learn
about the heart

00:16:04.460 --> 00:16:05.990 align:middle line:10%
through the world of our mind.

00:16:05.990 --> 00:16:07.370 align:middle line:10%
I think it's fascinating.

00:16:07.370 --> 00:16:10.077 align:middle line:84%
And I'm not saying what is
right and wrong, good or bad.

00:16:10.077 --> 00:16:11.660 align:middle line:84%
They're just very,
very different ways

00:16:11.660 --> 00:16:14.040 align:middle line:84%
of embracing the
potential, and that's

00:16:14.040 --> 00:16:15.290 align:middle line:90%
where I'm going with all this.

00:16:15.290 --> 00:16:16.880 align:middle line:84%
This is why I'm
sharing this with you.

00:16:16.880 --> 00:16:21.480 align:middle line:84%
We have this potential, and it's
been with us from the moment

00:16:21.480 --> 00:16:22.280 align:middle line:90%
that we appeared.

00:16:22.280 --> 00:16:24.740 align:middle line:84%
It didn't develop
slowly, gradually

00:16:24.740 --> 00:16:26.120 align:middle line:90%
over long periods of time.

00:16:26.120 --> 00:16:29.090 align:middle line:84%
We are over-endowed
with this potential.

00:16:29.090 --> 00:16:30.420 align:middle line:90%
So, what does that mean?

00:16:30.420 --> 00:16:33.290 align:middle line:84%
What does it mean in our lives
to have this kind of potential?

00:16:33.290 --> 00:16:37.730 align:middle line:84%
Well, when we harmonize our
heart and our brain together,

00:16:37.730 --> 00:16:40.550 align:middle line:84%
that's what gives us
our super abilities.

00:16:40.550 --> 00:16:43.120 align:middle line:84%
We harmonize the
heart and the brain.

00:16:43.120 --> 00:16:45.320 align:middle line:84%
Again, two separate
organs sharing

00:16:45.320 --> 00:16:48.080 align:middle line:90%
a common neural network.

00:16:48.080 --> 00:16:50.630 align:middle line:10%
So the neurites in our heart
and the neurites in our brain,

00:16:50.630 --> 00:16:54.210 align:middle line:10%
all of a sudden we have
access to super information

00:16:54.210 --> 00:16:55.010 align:middle line:10%
processing.

00:16:55.010 --> 00:16:58.100 align:middle line:84%
We can think and solve problems
really, really quickly.

00:16:58.100 --> 00:17:00.050 align:middle line:10%
We have almost total recall.

00:17:00.050 --> 00:17:01.730 align:middle line:90%
You walk into a room--

00:17:01.730 --> 00:17:05.000 align:middle line:84%
and if you think about
this, this is true.

00:17:05.000 --> 00:17:07.339 align:middle line:84%
When you walk into the room
and you look at the room,

00:17:07.339 --> 00:17:09.349 align:middle line:90%
your eyes have seen it.

00:17:09.349 --> 00:17:11.150 align:middle line:84%
You may not have made
a conscious effort

00:17:11.150 --> 00:17:12.859 align:middle line:84%
to remember it,
but you have just

00:17:12.859 --> 00:17:14.170 align:middle line:90%
taken in all that information.

00:17:14.170 --> 00:17:15.440 align:middle line:90%
It's there.

00:17:15.440 --> 00:17:18.470 align:middle line:84%
Heart brain harmony
allows us to access

00:17:18.470 --> 00:17:22.660 align:middle line:84%
and to have total recall of
that kind of information.

00:17:22.660 --> 00:17:25.069 align:middle line:84%
This harmonizing, the
heart and the brain,

00:17:25.069 --> 00:17:29.520 align:middle line:84%
it opens the door as a
conduit to our subconscious.

00:17:29.520 --> 00:17:31.070 align:middle line:90%
A conduit to our subconscious.

00:17:31.070 --> 00:17:33.870 align:middle line:84%
We don't need to
go under hypnosis

00:17:33.870 --> 00:17:35.150 align:middle line:90%
or be in an altered state.

00:17:35.150 --> 00:17:38.630 align:middle line:84%
We can, but we don't have to,
because we have the ability

00:17:38.630 --> 00:17:40.880 align:middle line:84%
to trigger these
states for ourselves.

00:17:40.880 --> 00:17:44.010 align:middle line:90%
We are self-healing beings.

00:17:44.010 --> 00:17:46.150 align:middle line:84%
What kind of healing
am I talking about?

00:17:46.150 --> 00:17:48.200 align:middle line:84%
When we talk about
subconscious, why

00:17:48.200 --> 00:17:51.560 align:middle line:84%
would you want direct
access to your subconscious?

00:17:51.560 --> 00:17:55.630 align:middle line:84%
Well, the short answer to
a very long story is this.

00:17:55.630 --> 00:17:57.760 align:middle line:84%
From the time we're
in our mother's womb

00:17:57.760 --> 00:18:00.040 align:middle line:84%
until we're about
six years old, we

00:18:00.040 --> 00:18:03.790 align:middle line:84%
begin to absorb
from our environment

00:18:03.790 --> 00:18:07.540 align:middle line:84%
patterns of personality,
patterns of behavior

00:18:07.540 --> 00:18:09.040 align:middle line:90%
from our caregivers--

00:18:09.040 --> 00:18:11.200 align:middle line:84%
maybe our parents, maybe
our adopted parents,

00:18:11.200 --> 00:18:13.240 align:middle line:84%
maybe our aunts and
uncles or grandparents,

00:18:13.240 --> 00:18:15.280 align:middle line:90%
maybe our friends.

00:18:15.280 --> 00:18:17.740 align:middle line:84%
From the time we're
in the womb hearing

00:18:17.740 --> 00:18:20.480 align:middle line:84%
through our mothers
stomach until the time

00:18:20.480 --> 00:18:23.680 align:middle line:84%
we're about 6 years old,
we are in a brain state

00:18:23.680 --> 00:18:25.160 align:middle line:90%
that is like a sponge.

00:18:25.160 --> 00:18:28.780 align:middle line:84%
It's called a hypnogogic
trance, and we don't know

00:18:28.780 --> 00:18:31.360 align:middle line:90%
how to filter what's coming in.

00:18:31.360 --> 00:18:33.160 align:middle line:84%
So this is nature's
way of preparing

00:18:33.160 --> 00:18:34.720 align:middle line:90%
us to be in the world.

00:18:34.720 --> 00:18:37.720 align:middle line:84%
We absorb these
patterns unconsciously

00:18:37.720 --> 00:18:40.390 align:middle line:84%
so that we learn how to
respond to the world.

00:18:40.390 --> 00:18:41.860 align:middle line:90%
Here's the deal.

00:18:41.860 --> 00:18:44.320 align:middle line:84%
If you were born into a
really healthy family that

00:18:44.320 --> 00:18:46.840 align:middle line:84%
had really healthy patterns
and healthy ways of dealing

00:18:46.840 --> 00:18:49.540 align:middle line:90%
with life, that's a great thing.

00:18:49.540 --> 00:18:51.730 align:middle line:84%
If you were not-- and I
know very few people who

00:18:51.730 --> 00:18:54.910 align:middle line:84%
can honestly say they
lived in a healthy family.

00:18:54.910 --> 00:18:57.520 align:middle line:84%
If we weren't,
then we're dealing

00:18:57.520 --> 00:18:59.510 align:middle line:84%
with patterns in
our relationships,

00:18:59.510 --> 00:19:01.690 align:middle line:84%
in our most intimate
relationships--

00:19:01.690 --> 00:19:05.110 align:middle line:84%
lovers, friends,
siblings, parents--

00:19:05.110 --> 00:19:06.640 align:middle line:84%
the relationship
with our bodies,

00:19:06.640 --> 00:19:09.730 align:middle line:84%
and our organs with our
bodies all linking back

00:19:09.730 --> 00:19:12.580 align:middle line:84%
to these subconscious
patterns that may not

00:19:12.580 --> 00:19:14.110 align:middle line:90%
be the healthiest patterns.

00:19:14.110 --> 00:19:16.420 align:middle line:84%
And it's through access
through the subconscious

00:19:16.420 --> 00:19:17.860 align:middle line:90%
that we can change those.

00:19:17.860 --> 00:19:22.750 align:middle line:84%
We can set new, healthy, vibrant
patterns, where we affirm life

00:19:22.750 --> 00:19:24.580 align:middle line:90%
by access to the subconscious.

00:19:24.580 --> 00:19:28.100 align:middle line:84%
So this is just one more
of the possibilities

00:19:28.100 --> 00:19:30.730 align:middle line:84%
when we could harmonize
the heart and the brain.

00:19:30.730 --> 00:19:32.680 align:middle line:84%
Harmonizing the
heart and the brain

00:19:32.680 --> 00:19:39.460 align:middle line:84%
gives us access to extraordinary
states of deep intuition.

00:19:39.460 --> 00:19:43.480 align:middle line:84%
Here's the key, deep
intuition on demand.

00:19:43.480 --> 00:19:45.550 align:middle line:90%
On demand.

00:19:45.550 --> 00:19:48.760 align:middle line:84%
I think we've all had the
experience of picking up

00:19:48.760 --> 00:19:51.130 align:middle line:84%
a telephone, for
example, to call someone,

00:19:51.130 --> 00:19:53.680 align:middle line:84%
and the other person
is already there.

00:19:53.680 --> 00:19:56.690 align:middle line:84%
There was a time in my life
where I was able to-- every

00:19:56.690 --> 00:19:57.490 align:middle line:90%
Sunday--

00:19:57.490 --> 00:19:59.740 align:middle line:84%
wherever I was in the world,
I would pick up the phone

00:19:59.740 --> 00:20:00.610 align:middle line:90%
and call my mom.

00:20:00.610 --> 00:20:03.250 align:middle line:84%
And we'd look forward to
our Sunday conversations.

00:20:03.250 --> 00:20:06.340 align:middle line:84%
It didn't happen every single
time, but it was common.

00:20:06.340 --> 00:20:09.670 align:middle line:84%
I would pick up the
phone to call my mom,

00:20:09.670 --> 00:20:11.320 align:middle line:84%
and she would already
be on the line.

00:20:11.320 --> 00:20:14.020 align:middle line:84%
Or I would pick up the phone
to dial my mom's number

00:20:14.020 --> 00:20:16.300 align:middle line:84%
and it was busy, and I
would hang up the phone

00:20:16.300 --> 00:20:18.280 align:middle line:84%
and it would ring because
she was calling me

00:20:18.280 --> 00:20:20.330 align:middle line:90%
that same instant in time.

00:20:20.330 --> 00:20:22.060 align:middle line:84%
And she used to get
a kick out of this.

00:20:22.060 --> 00:20:24.445 align:middle line:84%
My mom, she would
whisper on the phone

00:20:24.445 --> 00:20:25.570 align:middle line:90%
when we finally connected--

00:20:25.570 --> 00:20:28.210 align:middle line:84%
I mean, there's no one
listening-- she would whisper.

00:20:28.210 --> 00:20:30.820 align:middle line:84%
She'd say, see, you called
me when I called you

00:20:30.820 --> 00:20:32.530 align:middle line:90%
because we have ESP.

00:20:32.530 --> 00:20:33.970 align:middle line:90%
She says, we're psychic.

00:20:33.970 --> 00:20:36.070 align:middle line:84%
She used to love
to say that to me.

00:20:36.070 --> 00:20:37.390 align:middle line:90%
So when that happens--

00:20:37.390 --> 00:20:38.680 align:middle line:90%
now think about it.

00:20:38.680 --> 00:20:42.190 align:middle line:84%
When that happens, there has to
be a connection between the two

00:20:42.190 --> 00:20:43.750 align:middle line:90%
people that it's happening.

00:20:43.750 --> 00:20:48.010 align:middle line:84%
If I were on my way to the
telephone and I was diverted

00:20:48.010 --> 00:20:50.530 align:middle line:84%
even for an instant--
to get a glass of water,

00:20:50.530 --> 00:20:53.620 align:middle line:84%
to open up a window or
close a door for privacy--

00:20:53.620 --> 00:20:56.727 align:middle line:84%
even a nanosecond, I would
have missed the instant

00:20:56.727 --> 00:20:58.810 align:middle line:84%
that my mom was picking
up the phone, wherever she

00:20:58.810 --> 00:21:00.760 align:middle line:90%
was on the planet, to call me.

00:21:00.760 --> 00:21:02.380 align:middle line:90%
We wouldn't have had that.

00:21:02.380 --> 00:21:05.960 align:middle line:84%
When that connection
happens, that is intuition.

00:21:05.960 --> 00:21:07.930 align:middle line:90%
It is deep intuition.

00:21:07.930 --> 00:21:10.570 align:middle line:90%
However, it is spontaneous.

00:21:10.570 --> 00:21:12.460 align:middle line:84%
And I say that because
we didn't necessarily

00:21:12.460 --> 00:21:14.800 align:middle line:90%
do it intentionally.

00:21:14.800 --> 00:21:18.790 align:middle line:84%
How many times have you
been sitting at a stoplight

00:21:18.790 --> 00:21:21.550 align:middle line:84%
when the light was red and
you're waiting, waiting,

00:21:21.550 --> 00:21:23.406 align:middle line:84%
waiting for the
light to turn green.

00:21:23.406 --> 00:21:24.780 align:middle line:84%
And while you're
waiting you were

00:21:24.780 --> 00:21:26.549 align:middle line:84%
in an open state,
because you don't really

00:21:26.549 --> 00:21:28.090 align:middle line:84%
know when that
light's going to turn.

00:21:28.090 --> 00:21:30.370 align:middle line:84%
So you're kind of
not really thinking

00:21:30.370 --> 00:21:33.370 align:middle line:84%
about anything consciously,
and that openness

00:21:33.370 --> 00:21:37.180 align:middle line:90%
is the invitation for intuition.

00:21:37.180 --> 00:21:38.680 align:middle line:90%
That openness is the invitation.

00:21:38.680 --> 00:21:41.710 align:middle line:84%
All of a sudden, while you're
waiting for the light to turn,

00:21:41.710 --> 00:21:42.640 align:middle line:90%
you see this vision.

00:21:42.640 --> 00:21:44.320 align:middle line:84%
You understand
the nature of life

00:21:44.320 --> 00:21:47.111 align:middle line:84%
and the meaning of universe and
where your life is going to go.

00:21:47.111 --> 00:21:49.360 align:middle line:84%
And it's crystal clear, and
then the light turns green

00:21:49.360 --> 00:21:51.151 align:middle line:84%
and you start driving
and it all goes away.

00:21:51.151 --> 00:21:52.840 align:middle line:90%
And you say, where did that go?

00:21:52.840 --> 00:21:54.420 align:middle line:90%
How can I do that again?

00:21:54.420 --> 00:21:56.950 align:middle line:84%
Well I'm sharing these with
you because I think you

00:21:56.950 --> 00:21:58.810 align:middle line:90%
can relate to these examples.

00:21:58.810 --> 00:22:01.090 align:middle line:90%
They are spontaneous intuition.

00:22:01.090 --> 00:22:03.050 align:middle line:90%
They happen when they happen.

00:22:03.050 --> 00:22:06.070 align:middle line:84%
The key is-- and this is
where we find our power--

00:22:06.070 --> 00:22:08.950 align:middle line:84%
how can we trigger
those when we choose?

00:22:08.950 --> 00:22:12.640 align:middle line:84%
How can you tap into that
kind of information on demand

00:22:12.640 --> 00:22:15.340 align:middle line:90%
when you want to do so?

00:22:15.340 --> 00:22:17.500 align:middle line:84%
That is what harmonizing
the heart and the brain

00:22:17.500 --> 00:22:21.100 align:middle line:84%
is all about, and
that is only one more

00:22:21.100 --> 00:22:24.970 align:middle line:84%
of the powerful attributes
that are available to us

00:22:24.970 --> 00:22:28.380 align:middle line:84%
when we are able to harmonize
the heart and the brain.

00:22:28.380 --> 00:22:32.370 align:middle line:84%
These three examples I'm giving
you-- tapping the subconscious,

00:22:32.370 --> 00:22:35.550 align:middle line:84%
super learning, super
information processing,

00:22:35.550 --> 00:22:38.190 align:middle line:90%
deep intuition on demand--

00:22:38.190 --> 00:22:43.350 align:middle line:84%
these sort of form one
category of potential,

00:22:43.350 --> 00:22:46.320 align:middle line:84%
of human potential,
sometimes even relating

00:22:46.320 --> 00:22:49.372 align:middle line:84%
to the esoteric subconscious
and those kinds of things.

00:22:49.372 --> 00:22:51.330 align:middle line:84%
And if you're interested
in this but you're not

00:22:51.330 --> 00:22:54.240 align:middle line:84%
interested in those
kinds of things,

00:22:54.240 --> 00:22:56.090 align:middle line:84%
you still have benefit
from harmonizing

00:22:56.090 --> 00:22:57.090 align:middle line:90%
the heart and the brain.

00:22:57.090 --> 00:22:59.610 align:middle line:84%
Because even if you're
not into any of that,

00:22:59.610 --> 00:23:07.170 align:middle line:84%
your body interprets heart brain
harmony as healing, as love.

00:23:07.170 --> 00:23:10.800 align:middle line:84%
This is how we love our
bodies in a language

00:23:10.800 --> 00:23:12.840 align:middle line:90%
that our bodies recognize.

00:23:12.840 --> 00:23:14.970 align:middle line:84%
When we harmonize the
heart and the brain,

00:23:14.970 --> 00:23:18.480 align:middle line:84%
we set up a conversation
between the heart and the brain.

00:23:18.480 --> 00:23:21.510 align:middle line:84%
We're going to explore that
conversation a little bit more

00:23:21.510 --> 00:23:23.940 align:middle line:84%
in just a few minutes,
but that conversation

00:23:23.940 --> 00:23:29.370 align:middle line:84%
is what triggers over 1,300
biochemical reactions--

00:23:29.370 --> 00:23:32.300 align:middle line:84%
positive biochemical
reactions in our bodies.

00:23:32.300 --> 00:23:35.490 align:middle line:84%
Anti-aging hormones
kick into overdrive.

00:23:35.490 --> 00:23:38.850 align:middle line:84%
Powerful immune response
kicks into overdrive.

00:23:38.850 --> 00:23:42.570 align:middle line:84%
Cardiovascular benefits
kick into overdrive just

00:23:42.570 --> 00:23:45.330 align:middle line:84%
from this heart
brain communication.

00:23:45.330 --> 00:23:48.510 align:middle line:84%
So all of this becomes
possible, and more,

00:23:48.510 --> 00:23:50.600 align:middle line:84%
from harmonizing the
heart and the brain.

00:23:50.600 --> 00:23:53.550 align:middle line:84%
And one of the things I find
so fascinating is that our most

00:23:53.550 --> 00:23:56.160 align:middle line:84%
ancient and cherished--
once again--

00:23:56.160 --> 00:23:58.470 align:middle line:84%
spiritual traditions and
indigenous traditions,

00:23:58.470 --> 00:23:59.730 align:middle line:90%
they know this.

00:23:59.730 --> 00:24:02.850 align:middle line:84%
And they incorporate
this idea into many

00:24:02.850 --> 00:24:05.880 align:middle line:84%
of their traditions, their
ceremonies, their techniques,

00:24:05.880 --> 00:24:07.890 align:middle line:84%
even their prayers, but
they don't use science

00:24:07.890 --> 00:24:09.390 align:middle line:90%
to explain it.

00:24:09.390 --> 00:24:11.920 align:middle line:84%
This is what we're
going to do right now.

00:24:11.920 --> 00:24:14.580 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to share with
you precisely what it

00:24:14.580 --> 00:24:17.610 align:middle line:84%
is that's happening, because
it's all about the neurons.

00:24:17.610 --> 00:24:19.740 align:middle line:84%
And then I'd like for us
to have the opportunity

00:24:19.740 --> 00:24:22.410 align:middle line:84%
to experience this heart
brain harmony together

00:24:22.410 --> 00:24:23.800 align:middle line:90%
in this episode.

00:24:23.800 --> 00:24:28.230 align:middle line:84%
So everything that we're talking
about, it's all about neurons.

00:24:28.230 --> 00:24:31.410 align:middle line:84%
Neurons in the brain, and
we're all familiar with those,

00:24:31.410 --> 00:24:34.890 align:middle line:84%
but now we're talking
about neurons in the heart.

00:24:34.890 --> 00:24:38.190 align:middle line:84%
So I'd like for you to see,
maybe for the first time, what

00:24:38.190 --> 00:24:41.430 align:middle line:84%
those neurons really look
like, how they function,

00:24:41.430 --> 00:24:43.410 align:middle line:84%
what they do, and what
they mean in your life

00:24:43.410 --> 00:24:46.650 align:middle line:84%
so that we can use
this idea and you

00:24:46.650 --> 00:24:49.560 align:middle line:84%
can have this mental
imagery as you move forward

00:24:49.560 --> 00:24:52.620 align:middle line:84%
and begin to connect your
heart and your brain.

00:24:52.620 --> 00:24:54.630 align:middle line:84%
So on your screen right
now what you're seeing

00:24:54.630 --> 00:24:57.930 align:middle line:84%
is a typical neuron
in the brain.

00:24:57.930 --> 00:25:01.430 align:middle line:84%
The large nodule is
the neuron itself,

00:25:01.430 --> 00:25:04.410 align:middle line:84%
and the branches that
come out are the neurites.

00:25:04.410 --> 00:25:08.714 align:middle line:84%
So any appendage on the neuron
is considered to be a neurite.

00:25:08.714 --> 00:25:10.380 align:middle line:84%
The neurites can
become a lot of things.

00:25:10.380 --> 00:25:14.151 align:middle line:84%
They can become axions, if
you're familiar with neurology.

00:25:14.151 --> 00:25:15.900 align:middle line:84%
They can become a lot
of different things,

00:25:15.900 --> 00:25:18.270 align:middle line:84%
but these are what the
neurites are all about.

00:25:18.270 --> 00:25:21.450 align:middle line:10%
The next image that you're
looking at right now--

00:25:21.450 --> 00:25:23.730 align:middle line:10%
this is really
exciting because these

00:25:23.730 --> 00:25:26.780 align:middle line:10%
are some of the first
images of the neurons,

00:25:26.780 --> 00:25:28.080 align:middle line:10%
but they're not in the brain.

00:25:28.080 --> 00:25:30.000 align:middle line:90%
They're in the human heart.

00:25:30.000 --> 00:25:32.130 align:middle line:84%
There is an organization,
a pioneering research

00:25:32.130 --> 00:25:34.260 align:middle line:84%
organization in
Northern California,

00:25:34.260 --> 00:25:37.080 align:middle line:90%
The Institute of HeartMath--

00:25:37.080 --> 00:25:41.870 align:middle line:84%
H-E-A-R-T, capital M-A-T-H,
but it's all one word--

00:25:41.870 --> 00:25:45.660 align:middle line:84%
and they are pioneers at
researching the human heart

00:25:45.660 --> 00:25:49.890 align:middle line:84%
in non-conventional ways,
based on rock solid science.

00:25:49.890 --> 00:25:51.720 align:middle line:84%
They've made these
images available to us

00:25:51.720 --> 00:25:53.980 align:middle line:84%
today so I can
share them with you.

00:25:53.980 --> 00:25:57.570 align:middle line:84%
So you're actually seeing the
neurons in the human heart.

00:25:57.570 --> 00:25:59.340 align:middle line:84%
And these are the
neurons that begin

00:25:59.340 --> 00:26:02.760 align:middle line:84%
to communicate
with other neurons

00:26:02.760 --> 00:26:05.820 align:middle line:84%
and form the network between
the heart and the brain

00:26:05.820 --> 00:26:08.220 align:middle line:84%
that enable the activities,
all the things that we just

00:26:08.220 --> 00:26:09.210 align:middle line:90%
talked about--

00:26:09.210 --> 00:26:11.460 align:middle line:84%
subconscious access,
super learning,

00:26:11.460 --> 00:26:14.500 align:middle line:84%
super information processing,
deep intuition on-demand,

00:26:14.500 --> 00:26:16.180 align:middle line:90%
all of those things.

00:26:16.180 --> 00:26:18.310 align:middle line:84%
I want you to see
how this happens,

00:26:18.310 --> 00:26:21.590 align:middle line:84%
so I'm going to share with
you a brief film clip.

00:26:21.590 --> 00:26:25.650 align:middle line:84%
In this little clip-- the
technology now is so awesome.

00:26:25.650 --> 00:26:29.070 align:middle line:84%
It allows us to see these
neurons not as still images,

00:26:29.070 --> 00:26:32.130 align:middle line:84%
but we can actually see
them functioning inside

00:26:32.130 --> 00:26:34.120 align:middle line:90%
of living tissue.

00:26:34.120 --> 00:26:36.660 align:middle line:84%
So what you're seeing
on the screen right now

00:26:36.660 --> 00:26:40.680 align:middle line:84%
is you're seeing
neurons in time lapse,

00:26:40.680 --> 00:26:42.360 align:middle line:84%
and you're seeing
from the neurons--

00:26:42.360 --> 00:26:45.780 align:middle line:84%
you're seeing the
neurites as they move out.

00:26:45.780 --> 00:26:46.710 align:middle line:90%
They're very social.

00:26:46.710 --> 00:26:47.585 align:middle line:90%
They want to hook up.

00:26:47.585 --> 00:26:49.080 align:middle line:90%
They want to connect.

00:26:49.080 --> 00:26:51.540 align:middle line:84%
So these neurites are
looking for other neurites

00:26:51.540 --> 00:26:54.420 align:middle line:84%
to hook up with because
they want to form a network.

00:26:54.420 --> 00:26:56.122 align:middle line:90%
They want to form a chain.

00:26:56.122 --> 00:26:58.080 align:middle line:84%
And when they do, like
you're seeing right now,

00:26:58.080 --> 00:27:02.520 align:middle line:84%
the red arrows on your screen
are showing these networks

00:27:02.520 --> 00:27:05.040 align:middle line:84%
connecting, as well
as disconnecting.

00:27:05.040 --> 00:27:06.714 align:middle line:90%
A passing thought.

00:27:06.714 --> 00:27:08.880 align:middle line:84%
This is what happens when
we have a passing thought.

00:27:08.880 --> 00:27:09.755 align:middle line:90%
There's a connection.

00:27:09.755 --> 00:27:10.710 align:middle line:90%
It's brief.

00:27:10.710 --> 00:27:13.660 align:middle line:84%
And then that
connection goes away.

00:27:13.660 --> 00:27:16.950 align:middle line:84%
So as we see these
images, I'm going

00:27:16.950 --> 00:27:20.670 align:middle line:84%
to invite you to think about
what this means in your life.

00:27:20.670 --> 00:27:25.620 align:middle line:84%
Because when these
neurons are growing,

00:27:25.620 --> 00:27:28.650 align:middle line:84%
they are growing in
response to something

00:27:28.650 --> 00:27:30.840 align:middle line:90%
that you are doing in your life.

00:27:30.840 --> 00:27:32.400 align:middle line:90%
The act.

00:27:32.400 --> 00:27:38.310 align:middle line:84%
The act of you striving
to become something

00:27:38.310 --> 00:27:40.710 align:middle line:84%
more in the next
moments of your life

00:27:40.710 --> 00:27:43.290 align:middle line:84%
than you were in
the last moments.

00:27:43.290 --> 00:27:47.970 align:middle line:84%
The act of you choosing
to learn something new--

00:27:47.970 --> 00:27:50.010 align:middle line:84%
to learn a new way
to play your guitar,

00:27:50.010 --> 00:27:53.790 align:middle line:84%
to play the piano, or a new
form of art or a new thinking,

00:27:53.790 --> 00:27:56.970 align:middle line:84%
in terms of solving a mathematic
problem, or a new book

00:27:56.970 --> 00:28:00.160 align:middle line:84%
or a new play or
a new sculpture.

00:28:00.160 --> 00:28:02.790 align:middle line:90%
It is the act of creativity.

00:28:02.790 --> 00:28:09.670 align:middle line:10%
The act of you triggering that
creativity within your will,

00:28:09.670 --> 00:28:10.660 align:middle line:10%
within your being.

00:28:10.660 --> 00:28:14.650 align:middle line:84%
That act, that is the
biological trigger that

00:28:14.650 --> 00:28:18.130 align:middle line:84%
sets into motion the
neurons that you have just

00:28:18.130 --> 00:28:24.100 align:middle line:84%
seen as they begin to grow
and seek out partnerships

00:28:24.100 --> 00:28:26.320 align:middle line:84%
and connections
with other neurons,

00:28:26.320 --> 00:28:30.670 align:middle line:84%
to match what it is that you
have just asked them to do.

00:28:30.670 --> 00:28:34.924 align:middle line:84%
When you ask your being to
solve a mathematic problem

00:28:34.924 --> 00:28:37.090 align:middle line:84%
and you say, well, I've
never done this kind of math

00:28:37.090 --> 00:28:40.930 align:middle line:84%
before, or when you ask yourself
to learn a new language--

00:28:40.930 --> 00:28:42.970 align:middle line:84%
maybe you're learning
French, or when

00:28:42.970 --> 00:28:44.430 align:middle line:90%
I was trying to learn Tibetan.

00:28:44.430 --> 00:28:47.530 align:middle line:84%
Tibetan is a very
difficult language for me

00:28:47.530 --> 00:28:49.210 align:middle line:84%
because it doesn't
relate to English

00:28:49.210 --> 00:28:51.970 align:middle line:84%
the way alphabets and
the way that we're

00:28:51.970 --> 00:28:53.650 align:middle line:90%
used to hearing words.

00:28:53.650 --> 00:28:57.520 align:middle line:84%
So when I began learning the
little Tibetan that I do know,

00:28:57.520 --> 00:29:00.470 align:middle line:84%
what I would do is I would
go through the motion.

00:29:00.470 --> 00:29:02.920 align:middle line:84%
It's called fake it
until you make it.

00:29:02.920 --> 00:29:05.932 align:middle line:84%
I would go through and say
the words phonetically.

00:29:05.932 --> 00:29:07.390 align:middle line:84%
They didn't mean
a lot to me, but I

00:29:07.390 --> 00:29:09.310 align:middle line:90%
would say them again and again.

00:29:09.310 --> 00:29:11.410 align:middle line:90%
Here's what happens.

00:29:11.410 --> 00:29:14.470 align:middle line:84%
What scientists have
found is that when

00:29:14.470 --> 00:29:18.280 align:middle line:84%
those neurons are growing--
you saw the time-lapse.

00:29:18.280 --> 00:29:24.010 align:middle line:84%
That time-lapse doesn't
happen in an hour or in a day.

00:29:24.010 --> 00:29:29.020 align:middle line:84%
It happens in about 72
hours or about three days.

00:29:29.020 --> 00:29:33.640 align:middle line:84%
Scientists tell us it takes
about three days for us

00:29:33.640 --> 00:29:39.280 align:middle line:84%
to grow a new neural network
that will allow us to embrace

00:29:39.280 --> 00:29:42.355 align:middle line:84%
the new things that we have
asked ourselves to embrace so

00:29:42.355 --> 00:29:43.900 align:middle line:84%
that we can become
better people,

00:29:43.900 --> 00:29:46.090 align:middle line:84%
ultimately create
a better world.

00:29:46.090 --> 00:29:49.110 align:middle line:84%
And we trigger the whole
thing consciously, at will,

00:29:49.110 --> 00:29:52.510 align:middle line:84%
on demand in a way that no
other form of life can do.

00:29:52.510 --> 00:29:54.580 align:middle line:84%
In our next episode
we'll continue

00:29:54.580 --> 00:29:58.510 align:middle line:84%
exploring these extraordinary
abilities and others--

00:29:58.510 --> 00:30:01.060 align:middle line:84%
super learning, deep
intuition on demand--

00:30:01.060 --> 00:30:02.560 align:middle line:84%
but we're also
going to experience

00:30:02.560 --> 00:30:07.130 align:middle line:84%
the actual techniques to awaken
these potentials in our lives.

00:30:07.130 --> 00:30:09.620 align:middle line:84%
So I want to thank you
for joining me today.
