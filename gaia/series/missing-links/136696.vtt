00:00:25.090 --> 00:00:26.560 align:middle line:90%
>> My name is Gregg Braden.

00:00:26.560 --> 00:00:29.620 align:middle line:84%
I'd like to welcome you to
this very special presentation

00:00:29.620 --> 00:00:33.280 align:middle line:84%
of "Missing Links," the deep
truth of our origin, history,

00:00:33.280 --> 00:00:35.240 align:middle line:90%
destiny, and fate.

00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:37.990 align:middle line:10%
In the last episode,
we only began

00:00:37.990 --> 00:00:41.530 align:middle line:10%
to scratch the surface of the
extraordinary potential that's

00:00:41.530 --> 00:00:43.630 align:middle line:10%
available to us
through harmonizing

00:00:43.630 --> 00:00:46.840 align:middle line:10%
our heart and our brain,
marrying these two organs

00:00:46.840 --> 00:00:47.860 align:middle line:10%
together.

00:00:47.860 --> 00:00:50.020 align:middle line:84%
In this episode,
we're going to apply

00:00:50.020 --> 00:00:53.350 align:middle line:84%
what we learned to life
itself and to the secret

00:00:53.350 --> 00:00:55.420 align:middle line:90%
of an extended lifespan.

00:00:55.420 --> 00:00:58.570 align:middle line:84%
We'll also discover how
our advanced nervous system

00:00:58.570 --> 00:01:01.060 align:middle line:84%
triggers and
actually supercharges

00:01:01.060 --> 00:01:05.620 align:middle line:84%
our anti-aging mechanism so
that we can have long, healthy,

00:01:05.620 --> 00:01:08.690 align:middle line:90%
and vital lives.

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:11.390 align:middle line:84%
We've often heard it
said that from the moment

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:13.940 align:middle line:90%
we're born we began to die.

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:16.220 align:middle line:84%
Now, I know what the
intention is around that.

00:01:16.220 --> 00:01:19.010 align:middle line:84%
And I know where people's
thinking comes from,

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:21.845 align:middle line:84%
because they're referencing
the aging process.

00:01:21.845 --> 00:01:23.990 align:middle line:84%
But I want to tell you,
there's a consequence

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:25.190 align:middle line:90%
to thinking that way.

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:27.770 align:middle line:84%
And it's a consequence
that we probably

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:31.160 align:middle line:84%
would never consciously
inflict upon ourselves.

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:35.270 align:middle line:84%
Because our bodies respond
to those kinds of thoughts.

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:38.600 align:middle line:84%
The new science is showing us
something very, very different.

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:42.110 align:middle line:84%
It's actually more accurate
to say that from the moment

00:01:42.110 --> 00:01:44.900 align:middle line:90%
we're born, we begin to heal.

00:01:44.900 --> 00:01:47.390 align:middle line:84%
Here's where that
thinking is going.

00:01:47.390 --> 00:01:52.070 align:middle line:84%
There is a huge difference
between thinking of life

00:01:52.070 --> 00:01:58.430 align:middle line:84%
when we come into this world as
a finite amount of experience

00:01:58.430 --> 00:02:02.450 align:middle line:84%
that we use up
gradually over time.

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:04.640 align:middle line:84%
There's a big
difference between that

00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:10.070 align:middle line:84%
and thinking of life as a
living entity that is always

00:02:10.070 --> 00:02:13.760 align:middle line:84%
constantly replenishing,
rejuvenating,

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:15.590 align:middle line:90%
and healing itself.

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:19.310 align:middle line:84%
If you think about it, this
is a huge, huge difference.

00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:23.000 align:middle line:84%
Because when we think about
life as a finite quantity,

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:26.930 align:middle line:84%
we have set into motion
an expectation, maybe

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:31.400 align:middle line:84%
a subconscious expectation,
that every day, every year,

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:33.230 align:middle line:84%
every decade we're
using a little bit more,

00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:34.885 align:middle line:84%
a little bit more,
a little bit more.

00:02:34.885 --> 00:02:37.010 align:middle line:84%
And I'm not saying it's
right, wrong, good, or bad.

00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:40.220 align:middle line:84%
I'm saying it's all about how
you choose to live your life.

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:44.780 align:middle line:84%
If you choose to live a healthy
and vital and a productive life

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:47.990 align:middle line:84%
well beyond what is typically
accepted of the years

00:02:47.990 --> 00:02:50.600 align:middle line:84%
that we see today, the
70 to 100 years that

00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:53.660 align:middle line:84%
is the average in the
Western world today, then

00:02:53.660 --> 00:02:55.850 align:middle line:90%
that thinking has to change.

00:02:55.850 --> 00:03:00.680 align:middle line:84%
This explains why when we
see people that are typically

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:04.910 align:middle line:84%
of advanced age, they look
like they are of advanced age.

00:03:04.910 --> 00:03:06.490 align:middle line:90%
You ever thought about this?

00:03:06.490 --> 00:03:09.020 align:middle line:84%
You ever thought about
why is it that someone

00:03:09.020 --> 00:03:12.710 align:middle line:84%
when they are 100 or
110 or 114 years old,

00:03:12.710 --> 00:03:15.770 align:middle line:84%
which is right now the
oldest living person

00:03:15.770 --> 00:03:19.640 align:middle line:84%
is recorded in the Guinness
Book of Records, 114 years old.

00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:22.790 align:middle line:84%
When we see someone
who is 114 and that

00:03:22.790 --> 00:03:25.370 align:middle line:90%
their eyes appear dull.

00:03:25.370 --> 00:03:27.500 align:middle line:84%
They don't have that
sparkle anymore.

00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:31.310 align:middle line:84%
Their physical coordination
has begun to wane.

00:03:31.310 --> 00:03:34.460 align:middle line:84%
Their skin has lost
that elasticity.

00:03:34.460 --> 00:03:40.580 align:middle line:84%
And we look at them and they
look like 114 years old.

00:03:40.580 --> 00:03:44.870 align:middle line:84%
If we allow the
mechanisms in our bodies

00:03:44.870 --> 00:03:47.120 align:middle line:84%
to do what they're
designed to do,

00:03:47.120 --> 00:03:49.190 align:middle line:84%
there is, as I mentioned,
this huge difference

00:03:49.190 --> 00:03:52.040 align:middle line:84%
between thinking that
we're using up life

00:03:52.040 --> 00:03:55.490 align:middle line:84%
as we're going through
life and embracing

00:03:55.490 --> 00:03:59.030 align:middle line:84%
the fact that we are
constantly replenishing

00:03:59.030 --> 00:04:01.010 align:middle line:90%
the cells of our bodies.

00:04:01.010 --> 00:04:03.200 align:middle line:84%
We know that the
organs of our bodies

00:04:03.200 --> 00:04:05.900 align:middle line:84%
heal and replenish the
cells different rates.

00:04:05.900 --> 00:04:08.060 align:middle line:84%
The stomach lining
happens every day.

00:04:08.060 --> 00:04:11.510 align:middle line:84%
The heart tissue, for example,
happens less frequently.

00:04:11.510 --> 00:04:14.070 align:middle line:84%
But we know that
this is happening.

00:04:14.070 --> 00:04:16.190 align:middle line:84%
What I want to talk
to you about today

00:04:16.190 --> 00:04:20.690 align:middle line:84%
is the mechanism that allows
this replenishing to happen.

00:04:20.690 --> 00:04:23.830 align:middle line:84%
What we know about it,
what it means to us,

00:04:23.830 --> 00:04:26.480 align:middle line:84%
what it has meant in ages
past, and what it could mean

00:04:26.480 --> 00:04:28.460 align:middle line:90%
in your life in the future.

00:04:28.460 --> 00:04:30.500 align:middle line:84%
And to do this,
I'm going to begin

00:04:30.500 --> 00:04:33.260 align:middle line:90%
this conversation in Tibet.

00:04:33.260 --> 00:04:36.170 align:middle line:84%
I've had the opportunity,
I was blessed

00:04:36.170 --> 00:04:41.630 align:middle line:84%
with about a decade of travel
throughout Tibet in the time

00:04:41.630 --> 00:04:43.710 align:middle line:90%
when it was very accessible.

00:04:43.710 --> 00:04:47.300 align:middle line:84%
It was very easy to go
into the Tibetan Plateau,

00:04:47.300 --> 00:04:51.590 align:middle line:84%
and into the monasteries
and nunneries that

00:04:51.590 --> 00:04:55.250 align:middle line:84%
have the wisdom, the
records, the texts that

00:04:55.250 --> 00:04:56.690 align:middle line:90%
record the wisdom.

00:04:56.690 --> 00:04:59.750 align:middle line:10%
And also to be with the people
who live the wisdom that's

00:04:59.750 --> 00:05:02.030 align:middle line:10%
recorded in those texts.

00:05:02.030 --> 00:05:04.910 align:middle line:84%
So there are 12 monasteries
in two nunneries

00:05:04.910 --> 00:05:08.074 align:middle line:84%
between the capital
of Tibet, Lhasa,

00:05:08.074 --> 00:05:09.740 align:middle line:84%
and the highest
portions of the mountain

00:05:09.740 --> 00:05:12.340 align:middle line:84%
ranges where I
would routinely go.

00:05:12.340 --> 00:05:14.810 align:middle line:84%
And I had the opportunity to
lead small groups of people

00:05:14.810 --> 00:05:16.430 align:middle line:90%
into these places.

00:05:16.430 --> 00:05:19.040 align:middle line:84%
And we would go into
monastery after monastery

00:05:19.040 --> 00:05:21.630 align:middle line:84%
after monastery and
nunnery after nunnery

00:05:21.630 --> 00:05:23.540 align:middle line:90%
and be with the people.

00:05:23.540 --> 00:05:26.030 align:middle line:84%
Through the translators
we could sit with them

00:05:26.030 --> 00:05:28.550 align:middle line:84%
in the chanting halls when
they were doing the prayers

00:05:28.550 --> 00:05:30.680 align:middle line:84%
and when they were
doing their chants.

00:05:30.680 --> 00:05:33.650 align:middle line:84%
And for me, this is
the value, once again,

00:05:33.650 --> 00:05:39.950 align:middle line:84%
of being with our indigenous
family is something that we

00:05:39.950 --> 00:05:43.760 align:middle line:84%
simply cannot get from the
hieroglyphs on a temple wall

00:05:43.760 --> 00:05:47.030 align:middle line:84%
or from the words in
an old crumbling page.

00:05:47.030 --> 00:05:51.350 align:middle line:84%
Because it's only through human
interaction, heart to heart,

00:05:51.350 --> 00:05:55.220 align:middle line:84%
mind to mind, eye to eye,
god the god, human to human

00:05:55.220 --> 00:05:58.070 align:middle line:84%
that we can have the
kinds of conversations

00:05:58.070 --> 00:06:00.470 align:middle line:84%
where I can witness
in them something

00:06:00.470 --> 00:06:01.820 align:middle line:90%
that I may not understand.

00:06:01.820 --> 00:06:05.660 align:middle line:84%
Their ability to create
a miraculous healing

00:06:05.660 --> 00:06:08.290 align:middle line:84%
in their physical
body instantaneously.

00:06:08.290 --> 00:06:11.170 align:middle line:84%
Or to regulate their body
temperature, to raise and lower

00:06:11.170 --> 00:06:15.220 align:middle line:84%
that temperature instantaneously
when it's 15 degrees Fahrenheit

00:06:15.220 --> 00:06:18.340 align:middle line:84%
outside, they can go and
sit outside and consciously

00:06:18.340 --> 00:06:20.280 align:middle line:84%
raise their body
temperature to a point

00:06:20.280 --> 00:06:22.480 align:middle line:84%
where that cold
doesn't affect them.

00:06:22.480 --> 00:06:25.060 align:middle line:84%
I wasn't taught about that
in my life or my culture.

00:06:25.060 --> 00:06:28.124 align:middle line:84%
And so I can say to these
people, how did you do that?

00:06:28.124 --> 00:06:30.040 align:middle line:84%
How did you do what it
is that you were doing?

00:06:30.040 --> 00:06:32.756 align:middle line:84%
And they will answer me through
the translator in Tibetan.

00:06:32.756 --> 00:06:34.547 align:middle line:84%
And if I don't understand
what they've just

00:06:34.547 --> 00:06:37.480 align:middle line:84%
said through that translator, I
can go back and ask them again

00:06:37.480 --> 00:06:40.120 align:middle line:84%
and again and again until I
understand what's happening.

00:06:40.120 --> 00:06:43.570 align:middle line:84%
And that's something I cannot do
from the hieroglyphs of a Mayan

00:06:43.570 --> 00:06:46.510 align:middle line:90%
wall or an Egyptian temple wall.

00:06:46.510 --> 00:06:50.710 align:middle line:84%
That's why it's important
to be with our family,

00:06:50.710 --> 00:06:52.750 align:middle line:84%
our global family,
and to preserve

00:06:52.750 --> 00:06:54.580 align:middle line:90%
the wisdom in our time.

00:06:54.580 --> 00:06:56.060 align:middle line:84%
It's disappearing
so very quickly

00:06:56.060 --> 00:06:57.560 align:middle line:84%
that they've preserved
for hundreds,

00:06:57.560 --> 00:06:59.800 align:middle line:90%
some cases thousands of years.

00:06:59.800 --> 00:07:02.110 align:middle line:10%
So it was in Tibet.

00:07:02.110 --> 00:07:07.180 align:middle line:10%
And it was in the 2000s,
in this case in 2008,

00:07:07.180 --> 00:07:09.430 align:middle line:10%
where I had the
opportunity to go to one

00:07:09.430 --> 00:07:11.830 align:middle line:10%
of the most remote monasteries.

00:07:11.830 --> 00:07:15.610 align:middle line:10%
It took six days out of Lhasa
just to get to the monastery.

00:07:15.610 --> 00:07:19.480 align:middle line:84%
And once we were there, the
only way to get to the monastery

00:07:19.480 --> 00:07:23.260 align:middle line:84%
was through the local mode
of transportation, a yak.

00:07:23.260 --> 00:07:26.090 align:middle line:84%
Which is an amazing
way to travel

00:07:26.090 --> 00:07:28.360 align:middle line:84%
if you've never traveled
by yak up the mountain

00:07:28.360 --> 00:07:30.280 align:middle line:90%
trail to the monastery.

00:07:30.280 --> 00:07:32.110 align:middle line:84%
And it was in this
place where I first

00:07:32.110 --> 00:07:37.120 align:middle line:84%
encountered some of the nuns who
I sensed were of advanced age,

00:07:37.120 --> 00:07:39.250 align:middle line:90%
but I didn't know for sure.

00:07:39.250 --> 00:07:43.580 align:middle line:84%
Because on the one hand, they
looked like they might be,

00:07:43.580 --> 00:07:46.810 align:middle line:84%
but on the other hand, they
didn't look like elderly people

00:07:46.810 --> 00:07:48.850 align:middle line:84%
that I had encountered
in the West.

00:07:48.850 --> 00:07:50.410 align:middle line:90%
Their skin was taught.

00:07:50.410 --> 00:07:51.800 align:middle line:90%
It wasn't baggy and saggy.

00:07:51.800 --> 00:07:53.470 align:middle line:84%
Their eyes were
bright and clear.

00:07:53.470 --> 00:07:54.650 align:middle line:90%
They had teeth.

00:07:54.650 --> 00:07:55.450 align:middle line:90%
They had hair.

00:07:55.450 --> 00:07:58.630 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes they shave their
hair, especially the women

00:07:58.630 --> 00:08:01.120 align:middle line:84%
shave their hair for
convenience, for hygiene.

00:08:01.120 --> 00:08:02.890 align:middle line:90%
But it's still growing.

00:08:02.890 --> 00:08:05.350 align:middle line:84%
And so it was in this
particular monastery

00:08:05.350 --> 00:08:09.480 align:middle line:84%
where I asked one particular
woman, how old are you?

00:08:09.480 --> 00:08:11.680 align:middle line:84%
And I asked because
the Mother Superior

00:08:11.680 --> 00:08:13.930 align:middle line:90%
was able to provide the papers.

00:08:13.930 --> 00:08:17.290 align:middle line:84%
Now this is one of those places
in this program I cannot show

00:08:17.290 --> 00:08:22.180 align:middle line:84%
you her face for security and
to honor and respect her privacy

00:08:22.180 --> 00:08:24.100 align:middle line:90%
and her safety.

00:08:24.100 --> 00:08:25.750 align:middle line:84%
But I'm going to
tell you about her.

00:08:25.750 --> 00:08:28.540 align:middle line:84%
And then we are going to look
at a couple of other examples

00:08:28.540 --> 00:08:30.550 align:middle line:84%
where I can show you
their faces and you're

00:08:30.550 --> 00:08:32.032 align:middle line:90%
going to see the same thing.

00:08:32.032 --> 00:08:34.490 align:middle line:84%
But it was in this particular
woman, it was the first time.

00:08:34.490 --> 00:08:38.830 align:middle line:84%
This is my tip off, my clue that
longevity is possible in ways

00:08:38.830 --> 00:08:40.790 align:middle line:84%
that we simply don't
embrace in the West.

00:08:40.790 --> 00:08:41.590 align:middle line:90%
We discount it.

00:08:41.590 --> 00:08:43.929 align:middle line:84%
We call it a hoax or
we call it a fake.

00:08:43.929 --> 00:08:46.960 align:middle line:84%
But it's like those
out of place artifacts.

00:08:46.960 --> 00:08:49.719 align:middle line:84%
So many examples of
advanced age are cropping up

00:08:49.719 --> 00:08:51.010 align:middle line:90%
in so many places of the world.

00:08:51.010 --> 00:08:53.264 align:middle line:84%
The anomalies are now
beginning to tell a story,

00:08:53.264 --> 00:08:55.180 align:middle line:84%
and the story is very
different from the story

00:08:55.180 --> 00:08:57.220 align:middle line:84%
that you and I
probably have been

00:08:57.220 --> 00:08:59.140 align:middle line:90%
led to believe in the past.

00:08:59.140 --> 00:09:02.890 align:middle line:84%
The Tibetan nun that I'm
talking about right now,

00:09:02.890 --> 00:09:06.010 align:middle line:84%
when we saw her
papers, what we saw

00:09:06.010 --> 00:09:11.500 align:middle line:84%
is the confirmed date of her
birth was 1885, all right.

00:09:11.500 --> 00:09:15.460 align:middle line:84%
And the year that I was
with her was the year 2005.

00:09:15.460 --> 00:09:17.890 align:middle line:90%
We went back again in 2008.

00:09:17.890 --> 00:09:21.160 align:middle line:84%
My first contact
with her was in 2005.

00:09:21.160 --> 00:09:24.820 align:middle line:84%
1885 to 2005, that
means I was looking

00:09:24.820 --> 00:09:27.820 align:middle line:84%
in the eyes of a woman
who was 120 years old.

00:09:27.820 --> 00:09:31.060 align:middle line:84%
She did not look
like 120 years old.

00:09:31.060 --> 00:09:32.350 align:middle line:90%
She lived in a single room.

00:09:32.350 --> 00:09:34.760 align:middle line:84%
She walked to the river
every morning down

00:09:34.760 --> 00:09:36.280 align:middle line:84%
a hillside to
bring up the water.

00:09:36.280 --> 00:09:39.850 align:middle line:10%
She grew a lot of her own food
in the vessels and the vases

00:09:39.850 --> 00:09:43.510 align:middle line:10%
that were available to
her, basil, tomatoes,

00:09:43.510 --> 00:09:46.690 align:middle line:10%
herbs that she would eat
every day in a very, very

00:09:46.690 --> 00:09:47.710 align:middle line:10%
minimal diet.

00:09:47.710 --> 00:09:50.284 align:middle line:84%
She was good, healthy
strong, and vital.

00:09:50.284 --> 00:09:51.700 align:middle line:84%
And that told me
that something is

00:09:51.700 --> 00:09:54.820 align:middle line:84%
happening with her that maybe
is happening with other people.

00:09:54.820 --> 00:09:59.029 align:middle line:84%
Well interestingly, I asked
her what was her secret.

00:09:59.029 --> 00:10:00.820 align:middle line:84%
And she looked at me
through the translator

00:10:00.820 --> 00:10:03.640 align:middle line:84%
and she said one
word, compassion.

00:10:03.640 --> 00:10:06.340 align:middle line:84%
She said that's what we
learn in these monasteries.

00:10:06.340 --> 00:10:08.440 align:middle line:84%
That is the essence of
our Buddhist teachings.

00:10:08.440 --> 00:10:10.290 align:middle line:90%
It's all about compassion.

00:10:10.290 --> 00:10:12.040 align:middle line:84%
We'll see in a moment
why compassion would

00:10:12.040 --> 00:10:13.480 align:middle line:90%
have an effect of longevity.

00:10:13.480 --> 00:10:14.950 align:middle line:84%
Before we do that,
I want to show

00:10:14.950 --> 00:10:16.116 align:middle line:90%
you a couple of other cases.

00:10:16.116 --> 00:10:19.570 align:middle line:84%
Because I want you to see
this isn't an anomaly.

00:10:19.570 --> 00:10:22.150 align:middle line:84%
It wasn't long after I
met this Tibetan woman

00:10:22.150 --> 00:10:27.340 align:middle line:84%
that the national media
ran a story about a woman

00:10:27.340 --> 00:10:30.460 align:middle line:90%
in the Palestinian territories.

00:10:30.460 --> 00:10:32.590 align:middle line:10%
And you're seeing her
face on the screen

00:10:32.590 --> 00:10:35.530 align:middle line:10%
right now because she
made national news.

00:10:35.530 --> 00:10:39.400 align:middle line:10%
This was on the
Associated Press.

00:10:39.400 --> 00:10:42.280 align:middle line:84%
This woman, when
you look at her,

00:10:42.280 --> 00:10:44.260 align:middle line:84%
ask yourself how old
do you think she is.

00:10:44.260 --> 00:10:45.790 align:middle line:90%
Because here's her story.

00:10:45.790 --> 00:10:47.410 align:middle line:90%
She went shopping one day.

00:10:47.410 --> 00:10:49.270 align:middle line:90%
She hadn't been out for a while.

00:10:49.270 --> 00:10:51.250 align:middle line:84%
She had to go through
a military checkpoint

00:10:51.250 --> 00:10:53.140 align:middle line:84%
that she didn't have
to go through before,

00:10:53.140 --> 00:10:54.409 align:middle line:90%
didn't exist before.

00:10:54.409 --> 00:10:56.950 align:middle line:84%
They looked at her papers, they
said your papers are expired,

00:10:56.950 --> 00:10:59.080 align:middle line:84%
you have to go to
the authorities

00:10:59.080 --> 00:11:01.030 align:middle line:90%
and get some new papers.

00:11:01.030 --> 00:11:02.890 align:middle line:84%
And that's when
she made headlines.

00:11:02.890 --> 00:11:05.440 align:middle line:84%
Because when they checked
back through her records

00:11:05.440 --> 00:11:09.650 align:middle line:84%
they found her date
of birth was 1888.

00:11:09.650 --> 00:11:13.310 align:middle line:84%
And the woman you're
looking at in the year 2008,

00:11:13.310 --> 00:11:16.430 align:middle line:90%
she is 120 years old.

00:11:16.430 --> 00:11:19.430 align:middle line:84%
I'm not saying that she
looks like she's in her 20s,

00:11:19.430 --> 00:11:22.160 align:middle line:84%
but I think she looks really
good for 120 years old.

00:11:22.160 --> 00:11:23.330 align:middle line:90%
Her eyes are bright.

00:11:23.330 --> 00:11:24.500 align:middle line:90%
Her skin color is good.

00:11:24.500 --> 00:11:25.460 align:middle line:90%
Her teeth are good.

00:11:25.460 --> 00:11:27.370 align:middle line:90%
She still has her hair.

00:11:27.370 --> 00:11:29.450 align:middle line:84%
And I wanted to know
what is her secret.

00:11:29.450 --> 00:11:32.930 align:middle line:84%
And she said the secret
for her was the love

00:11:32.930 --> 00:11:36.530 align:middle line:84%
that she had for her family,
her children, her grandchildren,

00:11:36.530 --> 00:11:39.260 align:middle line:84%
her great grandchildren, her
great-great-grandchildren.

00:11:39.260 --> 00:11:40.940 align:middle line:84%
She said, they
need me every day.

00:11:40.940 --> 00:11:42.190 align:middle line:90%
What would they do without me?

00:11:42.190 --> 00:11:43.490 align:middle line:90%
She says, I fix their meals.

00:11:43.490 --> 00:11:45.540 align:middle line:84%
I help them with
their schoolwork.

00:11:45.540 --> 00:11:47.969 align:middle line:84%
I help them everything
they're doing in their lives.

00:11:47.969 --> 00:11:50.510 align:middle line:84%
I work in the garden so that I
can prepare the food for them.

00:11:50.510 --> 00:11:54.830 align:middle line:84%
She feels needed and she loves
her family and she feels loved.

00:11:54.830 --> 00:11:57.920 align:middle line:84%
That is a heart based
experience, all right.

00:11:57.920 --> 00:12:00.207 align:middle line:90%
So that's two.

00:12:00.207 --> 00:12:01.040 align:middle line:90%
And these are women.

00:12:01.040 --> 00:12:05.660 align:middle line:84%
And I wanted to find an
example that was of a male.

00:12:05.660 --> 00:12:07.490 align:middle line:84%
And it was only
through the research

00:12:07.490 --> 00:12:10.100 align:middle line:84%
I was able to find what I'm
about to share with you.

00:12:10.100 --> 00:12:13.070 align:middle line:10%
And I'm sharing
it with you, and I

00:12:13.070 --> 00:12:15.050 align:middle line:10%
believe this is
factual because it

00:12:15.050 --> 00:12:16.670 align:middle line:10%
was documented by the military.

00:12:16.670 --> 00:12:20.770 align:middle line:10%
And it was also documented in
an article in "Time" magazine

00:12:20.770 --> 00:12:22.791 align:middle line:10%
early in the 20th century.

00:12:22.791 --> 00:12:24.290 align:middle line:10%
The man that you're
looking at right

00:12:24.290 --> 00:12:28.970 align:middle line:10%
now has a very
interesting history.

00:12:28.970 --> 00:12:32.140 align:middle line:90%
His name is Li Ching-Yuen.

00:12:32.140 --> 00:12:34.750 align:middle line:84%
The image that you're
seeing is a photograph

00:12:34.750 --> 00:12:39.340 align:middle line:84%
that was taken of him in
1927 by the Chinese military.

00:12:39.340 --> 00:12:42.520 align:middle line:84%
He was at the residence
having a meal with an army

00:12:42.520 --> 00:12:45.220 align:middle line:90%
general at the time.

00:12:45.220 --> 00:12:48.910 align:middle line:90%
He was born in Sichuan China.

00:12:48.910 --> 00:12:51.520 align:middle line:84%
He spent the early part of
his life as an herbalist.

00:12:51.520 --> 00:12:53.530 align:middle line:84%
He was a high
altitude herbalist.

00:12:53.530 --> 00:12:56.170 align:middle line:90%
And he's also a martial artist.

00:12:56.170 --> 00:13:00.010 align:middle line:84%
So he lived in high
elevation, thin air,

00:13:00.010 --> 00:13:04.420 align:middle line:84%
a minimal diet of very
specific kinds of herbs.

00:13:04.420 --> 00:13:06.580 align:middle line:84%
And he learned about the
energy of the human body

00:13:06.580 --> 00:13:08.350 align:middle line:90%
through martial arts.

00:13:08.350 --> 00:13:11.560 align:middle line:84%
He enlisted in the
Chinese military

00:13:11.560 --> 00:13:12.820 align:middle line:90%
at a relatively late age.

00:13:12.820 --> 00:13:18.430 align:middle line:84%
He was 72 years old when he
enlisted as a cartographer.

00:13:18.430 --> 00:13:20.650 align:middle line:84%
And he is documented
as enlisting

00:13:20.650 --> 00:13:24.946 align:middle line:84%
in the Chinese military
in the year 1749.

00:13:24.946 --> 00:13:27.250 align:middle line:84%
Now the Chinese keep
meticulous records,

00:13:27.250 --> 00:13:31.960 align:middle line:84%
and that's why I trust
these records, 1749.

00:13:31.960 --> 00:13:33.790 align:middle line:90%
He left the military.

00:13:33.790 --> 00:13:36.490 align:middle line:84%
And he went back to his
home in the mountains

00:13:36.490 --> 00:13:41.800 align:middle line:84%
after he served as a
cartographer at the age of 97.

00:13:41.800 --> 00:13:45.430 align:middle line:10%
And three years later,
the military records

00:13:45.430 --> 00:13:49.480 align:middle line:10%
sent him a congratulations
on his 100th birthday.

00:13:49.480 --> 00:13:53.170 align:middle line:10%
That was the year 1777.

00:13:53.170 --> 00:13:55.990 align:middle line:10%
They sent him another
congratulations

00:13:55.990 --> 00:13:59.260 align:middle line:10%
on his 150th birthday,
and the records

00:13:59.260 --> 00:14:04.030 align:middle line:10%
shows this very clearly
in the year 1827.

00:14:04.030 --> 00:14:06.970 align:middle line:84%
And this is where it gets
really, really interesting.

00:14:06.970 --> 00:14:09.730 align:middle line:84%
They sent him another
congratulations

00:14:09.730 --> 00:14:15.400 align:middle line:84%
for his 200th birthday
in the year 1877.

00:14:15.400 --> 00:14:19.730 align:middle line:90%
He died May 6, 1933.

00:14:19.730 --> 00:14:22.480 align:middle line:84%
His birth date, now there
are two different dates.

00:14:22.480 --> 00:14:25.330 align:middle line:84%
He said that his
birth date was later.

00:14:25.330 --> 00:14:28.990 align:middle line:84%
He said he was
only born in 1736.

00:14:28.990 --> 00:14:34.270 align:middle line:84%
The military records, however,
show that he was born in 1677.

00:14:34.270 --> 00:14:37.000 align:middle line:84%
So either one of
these is showing a man

00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:39.280 align:middle line:90%
of tremendously advanced age.

00:14:39.280 --> 00:14:45.010 align:middle line:84%
His age at death was
either 197 or 256.

00:14:45.010 --> 00:14:49.060 align:middle line:84%
And this borders on what
are called biblical ages.

00:14:49.060 --> 00:14:51.920 align:middle line:84%
When he died he was
seven feet tall.

00:14:51.920 --> 00:14:56.980 align:middle line:84%
He had accomplished 14
marriages over 11 generations.

00:14:56.980 --> 00:15:01.480 align:middle line:10%
And by some estimates, had
as many as 180 children

00:15:01.480 --> 00:15:04.300 align:middle line:10%
that were attributed
to his marriages.

00:15:04.300 --> 00:15:08.650 align:middle line:84%
"Time" magazine wrote an
article on him, on Li,

00:15:08.650 --> 00:15:13.570 align:middle line:84%
and actually did an
obituary May 15, 1933.

00:15:13.570 --> 00:15:17.560 align:middle line:84%
They acknowledged the
validity of his longevity.

00:15:17.560 --> 00:15:20.050 align:middle line:84%
And in this article,
they asked what was

00:15:20.050 --> 00:15:21.550 align:middle line:90%
the secret to his long life.

00:15:21.550 --> 00:15:24.790 align:middle line:84%
Before he died he had
shared that secret.

00:15:24.790 --> 00:15:28.900 align:middle line:84%
This secret, he said,
was all about the heart.

00:15:28.900 --> 00:15:32.320 align:middle line:84%
The secret was to
keep a quiet heart.

00:15:32.320 --> 00:15:34.840 align:middle line:90%
Now this is not typical.

00:15:34.840 --> 00:15:36.730 align:middle line:90%
I don't think it's the oldest.

00:15:36.730 --> 00:15:39.640 align:middle line:84%
Because the time that
I've spent in Tibet,

00:15:39.640 --> 00:15:41.390 align:middle line:84%
the monks and nuns
have told me that there

00:15:41.390 --> 00:15:43.730 align:middle line:90%
are yogis that are much older.

00:15:43.730 --> 00:15:45.397 align:middle line:84%
I'm not sharing
those with you here,

00:15:45.397 --> 00:15:46.480 align:middle line:90%
and here's the reason why.

00:15:46.480 --> 00:15:47.830 align:middle line:90%
I cannot document it.

00:15:47.830 --> 00:15:52.780 align:middle line:84%
I cannot say to you factually
as a scientist those yogis are

00:15:52.780 --> 00:15:55.540 align:middle line:90%
actually 400 and 500 years old.

00:15:55.540 --> 00:15:59.470 align:middle line:84%
And the truth is, that the
lives that I'm told they live

00:15:59.470 --> 00:16:01.090 align:middle line:84%
don't sound like
very exciting lives.

00:16:01.090 --> 00:16:04.630 align:middle line:84%
They lived lives of ascetics,
very little clothing.

00:16:04.630 --> 00:16:05.846 align:middle line:90%
They don't move very much.

00:16:05.846 --> 00:16:07.470 align:middle line:84%
They spend a lot of
time in meditation.

00:16:07.470 --> 00:16:15.290 align:middle line:84%
And their bodies, their bodies
are strong and they're healthy,

00:16:15.290 --> 00:16:17.870 align:middle line:84%
but they're not as
engaged in everyday life.

00:16:17.870 --> 00:16:20.110 align:middle line:84%
If I'm going to live
200, 300, 400 years old,

00:16:20.110 --> 00:16:23.320 align:middle line:84%
I'd like to be very
engaged in everyday life.

00:16:23.320 --> 00:16:25.720 align:middle line:84%
From the time I
was five years old,

00:16:25.720 --> 00:16:28.180 align:middle line:84%
I told my mom that I
would be in this world,

00:16:28.180 --> 00:16:29.970 align:middle line:90%
I'd be on Earth for 200 years.

00:16:29.970 --> 00:16:32.470 align:middle line:90%
I'm on the 200 year plan.

00:16:32.470 --> 00:16:36.490 align:middle line:84%
And while mom used to laugh
when I would tell her that,

00:16:36.490 --> 00:16:39.494 align:middle line:84%
she later in life began
to take it very seriously.

00:16:39.494 --> 00:16:41.410 align:middle line:84%
And she would say that
to me when it came time

00:16:41.410 --> 00:16:43.200 align:middle line:84%
to wish me happy
birthday, she would say,

00:16:43.200 --> 00:16:44.950 align:middle line:84%
I could wish you happy
birthday, she said,

00:16:44.950 --> 00:16:46.491 align:middle line:84%
but you're on the
200 year plan, so I

00:16:46.491 --> 00:16:50.500 align:middle line:84%
have a lot more opportunities
to do just this.

00:16:50.500 --> 00:16:55.250 align:middle line:84%
The point is, can we live beyond
this traditional 70 to 100

00:16:55.250 --> 00:16:56.050 align:middle line:90%
years?

00:16:56.050 --> 00:16:57.610 align:middle line:90%
Would we want to?

00:16:57.610 --> 00:16:59.110 align:middle line:84%
And a lot of times
when I ask people

00:16:59.110 --> 00:17:02.260 align:middle line:84%
if they want to, what they say
to me is they don't want to.

00:17:02.260 --> 00:17:07.060 align:middle line:84%
Because to them, old age
equates to suffering.

00:17:07.060 --> 00:17:09.693 align:middle line:84%
Old age equates to
the body breaking down

00:17:09.693 --> 00:17:11.859 align:middle line:84%
and the things that they've
seen in their lifetimes.

00:17:11.859 --> 00:17:13.855 align:middle line:84%
And I want to say
to you right now,

00:17:13.855 --> 00:17:15.220 align:middle line:90%
it doesn't have to be that way.

00:17:15.220 --> 00:17:17.380 align:middle line:90%
The science is showing us this.

00:17:17.380 --> 00:17:20.470 align:middle line:84%
And the indigenous traditions
are telling us this.

00:17:20.470 --> 00:17:23.020 align:middle line:84%
What was the common
link between the three

00:17:23.020 --> 00:17:25.319 align:middle line:84%
people of advanced age
that we just talked about?

00:17:25.319 --> 00:17:29.440 align:middle line:84%
The Palestinian woman,
the Tibetan nun, and Li,

00:17:29.440 --> 00:17:30.919 align:middle line:90%
what was the common theme?

00:17:30.919 --> 00:17:32.710 align:middle line:84%
And I gave it away
already, because I'm not

00:17:32.710 --> 00:17:34.540 align:middle line:90%
good at keeping secrets.

00:17:34.540 --> 00:17:35.560 align:middle line:90%
I gave it away.

00:17:35.560 --> 00:17:38.360 align:middle line:90%
Each of them had a feeling.

00:17:38.360 --> 00:17:41.440 align:middle line:84%
The Palestinian woman
felt love for her family

00:17:41.440 --> 00:17:44.020 align:middle line:90%
and she felt that she was loved.

00:17:44.020 --> 00:17:47.320 align:middle line:84%
The Tibetan nun felt the
feeling of compassion.

00:17:47.320 --> 00:17:49.330 align:middle line:90%
That's a heart based experience.

00:17:49.330 --> 00:17:52.060 align:middle line:84%
Li said the secret
was a quiet heart,

00:17:52.060 --> 00:17:56.140 align:middle line:84%
feeling the feelings of calmness
and serenity in his life.

00:17:56.140 --> 00:17:58.600 align:middle line:84%
So the common thread
for all of these?

00:17:58.600 --> 00:18:01.420 align:middle line:84%
All of them are linked to
a heart-based experience.

00:18:01.420 --> 00:18:05.380 align:middle line:84%
And you say, well, why would
a heart-based experience

00:18:05.380 --> 00:18:08.080 align:middle line:90%
create this kind of longevity?

00:18:08.080 --> 00:18:10.030 align:middle line:84%
And the answer to
that is the secret

00:18:10.030 --> 00:18:12.490 align:middle line:90%
to where we're going right now.

00:18:12.490 --> 00:18:16.930 align:middle line:84%
It probably comes as no surprise
that a heart based experience

00:18:16.930 --> 00:18:20.650 align:middle line:84%
would have some effect
on our longevity.

00:18:20.650 --> 00:18:24.010 align:middle line:84%
But the mechanism is what I want
to talk to you about right now.

00:18:24.010 --> 00:18:26.980 align:middle line:84%
Because what you have just
learned in the last episode,

00:18:26.980 --> 00:18:29.560 align:middle line:84%
the ability to harmonize
your heart and your brain

00:18:29.560 --> 00:18:33.160 align:middle line:84%
in a very precise way, in
addition to all of the benefits

00:18:33.160 --> 00:18:37.960 align:middle line:84%
that we've already shared,
is the underlying trigger

00:18:37.960 --> 00:18:42.910 align:middle line:84%
to unlock the potential
of longevity and vitality,

00:18:42.910 --> 00:18:45.640 align:middle line:90%
healthy longevity in your life.

00:18:45.640 --> 00:18:47.950 align:middle line:84%
And it all begins,
not surprisingly,

00:18:47.950 --> 00:18:51.490 align:middle line:84%
with our DNA and the
chromosomes that we have talked

00:18:51.490 --> 00:18:53.740 align:middle line:90%
about earlier in this program.

00:18:53.740 --> 00:18:57.490 align:middle line:84%
Each time our cells divide,
something really, really

00:18:57.490 --> 00:18:59.560 align:middle line:84%
interesting begins
to happen among

00:18:59.560 --> 00:19:02.950 align:middle line:84%
the many interesting things that
happen within the chromosomes

00:19:02.950 --> 00:19:04.240 align:middle line:90%
themselves.

00:19:04.240 --> 00:19:06.910 align:middle line:84%
In the earlier
episode, I described

00:19:06.910 --> 00:19:10.600 align:middle line:84%
how the tip of every
chromosome, the DNA

00:19:10.600 --> 00:19:14.440 align:middle line:84%
at the tip of every chromosome
has a special component called

00:19:14.440 --> 00:19:16.512 align:middle line:90%
a telomere at the end.

00:19:16.512 --> 00:19:18.220 align:middle line:84%
I didn't talk a lot
about those telomeres

00:19:18.220 --> 00:19:20.870 align:middle line:84%
then because I knew
I would right now.

00:19:20.870 --> 00:19:24.310 align:middle line:84%
A telomere you can
think of in just the way

00:19:24.310 --> 00:19:27.910 align:middle line:84%
you would think of the shoe
laces on your tennis shoes.

00:19:27.910 --> 00:19:31.210 align:middle line:84%
If you look at the ends of the
shoelaces on your tennis shoes,

00:19:31.210 --> 00:19:33.040 align:middle line:84%
they typically have
a little plastic cap

00:19:33.040 --> 00:19:35.280 align:middle line:84%
over the end that
keeps them from fraying

00:19:35.280 --> 00:19:37.030 align:middle line:84%
and makes it possible
for you to lace them

00:19:37.030 --> 00:19:39.430 align:middle line:90%
through the eyes on your shoes.

00:19:39.430 --> 00:19:42.880 align:middle line:84%
Well, the ends of your
DNA, your telomeres,

00:19:42.880 --> 00:19:45.570 align:middle line:84%
are the equivalent of
those little plastic caps.

00:19:45.570 --> 00:19:51.170 align:middle line:84%
And every time your cell
divides, the chromosomes

00:19:51.170 --> 00:19:54.110 align:middle line:84%
in the division
process, they are

00:19:54.110 --> 00:19:58.250 align:middle line:84%
incapable of completing
division all the way

00:19:58.250 --> 00:20:00.290 align:middle line:90%
to the end of the DNA.

00:20:00.290 --> 00:20:02.510 align:middle line:84%
So what that means, is
with each cell division,

00:20:02.510 --> 00:20:05.050 align:middle line:84%
a little piece of
the DNA breaks off.

00:20:05.050 --> 00:20:07.940 align:middle line:10%
Its brittle, it breaks
away and its lost.

00:20:07.940 --> 00:20:10.190 align:middle line:10%
That is what the telomeres do.

00:20:10.190 --> 00:20:12.920 align:middle line:10%
They are the buffer so
that what breaks off

00:20:12.920 --> 00:20:17.180 align:middle line:10%
is the telomere and not the
information of the DNA itself.

00:20:17.180 --> 00:20:20.064 align:middle line:10%
So when one cell
divides in the two,

00:20:20.064 --> 00:20:21.980 align:middle line:10%
you lose a little bit
of telomeres at the end.

00:20:21.980 --> 00:20:23.354 align:middle line:10%
That's OK, you've
got a lot left.

00:20:23.354 --> 00:20:26.270 align:middle line:10%
Two divide into four, you
lose a little bit more.

00:20:26.270 --> 00:20:28.867 align:middle line:10%
You've got a lot left, but
not as much as you did before.

00:20:28.867 --> 00:20:30.200 align:middle line:10%
And you see where this is going.

00:20:30.200 --> 00:20:34.460 align:middle line:10%
It goes on and on for
a finite period of time

00:20:34.460 --> 00:20:39.350 align:middle line:10%
until we reach a point where
the telomere is so short

00:20:39.350 --> 00:20:42.200 align:middle line:10%
or it is so weak it
can no longer protect

00:20:42.200 --> 00:20:43.340 align:middle line:10%
the rest of the DNA.

00:20:43.340 --> 00:20:47.090 align:middle line:10%
And when your cell reaches that
point, we call it senescence.

00:20:47.090 --> 00:20:48.470 align:middle line:10%
We call it old age.

00:20:48.470 --> 00:20:51.000 align:middle line:10%
And eventually,
we call it death.

00:20:51.000 --> 00:20:54.690 align:middle line:10%
Because the cell cannot
preserve the information,

00:20:54.690 --> 00:20:57.250 align:middle line:10%
the DNA cannot preserve
the information.

00:20:57.250 --> 00:21:00.570 align:middle line:10%
And because of that, it
won't allow itself to divide

00:21:00.570 --> 00:21:02.550 align:middle line:10%
with bad information.

00:21:02.550 --> 00:21:04.770 align:middle line:84%
All right, so that's
the mechanism.

00:21:04.770 --> 00:21:06.930 align:middle line:84%
Telomere shortening,
it's directly

00:21:06.930 --> 00:21:10.060 align:middle line:90%
linked to stress in our lives.

00:21:10.060 --> 00:21:12.280 align:middle line:84%
And I want to say
this to you directly.

00:21:12.280 --> 00:21:15.257 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to read directly
from the scientific documents,

00:21:15.257 --> 00:21:16.590 align:middle line:90%
so you know it's not my opinion.

00:21:16.590 --> 00:21:19.230 align:middle line:10%
I want you to hear
exactly what it

00:21:19.230 --> 00:21:20.820 align:middle line:10%
is they're saying about this.

00:21:20.820 --> 00:21:23.640 align:middle line:10%
In the proceedings of the
National Academy of Sciences,

00:21:23.640 --> 00:21:25.479 align:middle line:10%
the title of this
research article,

00:21:25.479 --> 00:21:26.520 align:middle line:10%
it tells the whole story.

00:21:26.520 --> 00:21:27.690 align:middle line:10%
Listen to the title.

00:21:27.690 --> 00:21:33.780 align:middle line:10%
"Accelerated Telomere Shortening
in Response to Life Stress."

00:21:33.780 --> 00:21:38.320 align:middle line:10%
What they're saying is chronic
stress erodes the telomeres.

00:21:38.320 --> 00:21:43.470 align:middle line:10%
It impairs the DNA replication,
and it accelerates the aging.

00:21:43.470 --> 00:21:48.030 align:middle line:10%
So this is peer reviewed science
saying in open paper what

00:21:48.030 --> 00:21:50.020 align:middle line:10%
we're talking about right now.

00:21:50.020 --> 00:21:52.042 align:middle line:84%
It is the stress,
the stress of life.

00:21:52.042 --> 00:21:53.250 align:middle line:90%
It can come from many places.

00:21:53.250 --> 00:21:55.320 align:middle line:84%
It can come from the
job, come from work.

00:21:55.320 --> 00:21:56.770 align:middle line:90%
It can be emotional stress.

00:21:56.770 --> 00:21:58.270 align:middle line:90%
It can be environmental stress.

00:21:58.270 --> 00:22:00.220 align:middle line:90%
It can be psychological stress.

00:22:00.220 --> 00:22:01.470 align:middle line:90%
It can be a healing crisis.

00:22:01.470 --> 00:22:03.452 align:middle line:90%
There are all kinds of stress.

00:22:03.452 --> 00:22:04.410 align:middle line:90%
So it's not the stress.

00:22:04.410 --> 00:22:09.090 align:middle line:84%
It's about how we interpret and
how we deal with that stress.

00:22:09.090 --> 00:22:13.950 align:middle line:84%
When we are born, we have a very
high complement of telomeres.

00:22:13.950 --> 00:22:15.970 align:middle line:84%
What scientists tell
us is when we're born,

00:22:15.970 --> 00:22:20.160 align:middle line:84%
we have about 8,000 base pairs
of telomeres to begin with.

00:22:20.160 --> 00:22:24.770 align:middle line:84%
By the time we're in our 30s, we
have maybe half of that number.

00:22:24.770 --> 00:22:27.270 align:middle line:84%
And by the time we're in our
60s we have maybe about a third

00:22:27.270 --> 00:22:29.790 align:middle line:90%
of that number, typically.

00:22:29.790 --> 00:22:31.980 align:middle line:84%
But the good news is,
all that can change.

00:22:31.980 --> 00:22:36.720 align:middle line:84%
And you can direct how
it changes in your life.

00:22:36.720 --> 00:22:42.370 align:middle line:84%
The lifetime of a telomere
and the lifetime of a cell

00:22:42.370 --> 00:22:47.320 align:middle line:84%
are generally accepted to be
about 40 to 60 cell divisions.

00:22:47.320 --> 00:22:52.150 align:middle line:84%
So 40 to 60 cell divisions
is generally the lifetime

00:22:52.150 --> 00:22:53.260 align:middle line:90%
of an average cell.

00:22:53.260 --> 00:22:54.910 align:middle line:84%
And this is what
scientists tell us.

00:22:54.910 --> 00:22:57.460 align:middle line:84%
It is the limit
of that lifetime.

00:22:57.460 --> 00:22:58.910 align:middle line:84%
And the limit
actually has a name.

00:22:58.910 --> 00:23:01.180 align:middle line:84%
It's named after the man
that discovered the limit.

00:23:01.180 --> 00:23:05.500 align:middle line:84%
It is called the Hayflick
limit, Hayflick limit.

00:23:05.500 --> 00:23:08.650 align:middle line:84%
That is the number of
times, the Hayflick limit

00:23:08.650 --> 00:23:10.960 align:middle line:84%
defines how many
times our cells can

00:23:10.960 --> 00:23:14.050 align:middle line:84%
divide before they reach the
point where the telomeres

00:23:14.050 --> 00:23:15.760 align:middle line:90%
aren't working any longer.

00:23:15.760 --> 00:23:18.490 align:middle line:84%
Interestingly,
that Hayflick limit

00:23:18.490 --> 00:23:20.890 align:middle line:84%
equates, if you take that
number of cell divisions

00:23:20.890 --> 00:23:25.330 align:middle line:84%
and how long they live, that
equates to about 120 years

00:23:25.330 --> 00:23:26.890 align:middle line:90%
of human life.

00:23:26.890 --> 00:23:31.840 align:middle line:84%
So we're beginning to see why
we do see people living up

00:23:31.840 --> 00:23:32.940 align:middle line:90%
to 120 years.

00:23:32.940 --> 00:23:36.130 align:middle line:84%
We don't see a lot after
that, because they have

00:23:36.130 --> 00:23:37.360 align:middle line:90%
reached this Hayflick limit.

00:23:37.360 --> 00:23:41.410 align:middle line:84%
The question is, can we
increase that Hayflick limit?

00:23:41.410 --> 00:23:42.890 align:middle line:90%
Are we bound to that limit?

00:23:42.890 --> 00:23:44.431 align:middle line:84%
And the answer is
yes, or we wouldn't

00:23:44.431 --> 00:23:46.030 align:middle line:90%
be having this conversation.

00:23:46.030 --> 00:23:50.860 align:middle line:84%
And a discovery in 2009
tells us why it's possible.

00:23:50.860 --> 00:23:57.580 align:middle line:84%
In 2009, the Nobel Prize
in medicine and physiology

00:23:57.580 --> 00:24:00.190 align:middle line:84%
was awarded to three people,
to Carol Greider, Elizabeth

00:24:00.190 --> 00:24:03.130 align:middle line:90%
Blackburn, and Jack Szostak.

00:24:03.130 --> 00:24:06.220 align:middle line:84%
They all worked
together to discover

00:24:06.220 --> 00:24:07.962 align:middle line:90%
an enzyme in the human body.

00:24:07.962 --> 00:24:09.420 align:middle line:84%
Now think about
this, this is 2009,

00:24:09.420 --> 00:24:11.920 align:middle line:90%
that was just a few years ago.

00:24:11.920 --> 00:24:15.280 align:middle line:84%
And they're still discovering
things about the human body

00:24:15.280 --> 00:24:17.320 align:middle line:84%
that we haven't
known in the past.

00:24:17.320 --> 00:24:19.900 align:middle line:84%
This new enzyme was
mysterious at first.

00:24:19.900 --> 00:24:22.060 align:middle line:84%
They found the enzyme,
they weren't sure

00:24:22.060 --> 00:24:23.941 align:middle line:90%
what the function was.

00:24:23.941 --> 00:24:27.370 align:middle line:84%
But the only place
they found the enzyme

00:24:27.370 --> 00:24:32.260 align:middle line:84%
was hovering near the
end of the telomeres.

00:24:32.260 --> 00:24:35.350 align:middle line:84%
So they theorized, maybe
this enzyme has something

00:24:35.350 --> 00:24:36.970 align:middle line:90%
to do with the telomeres.

00:24:36.970 --> 00:24:39.310 align:middle line:84%
And if it does,
maybe the enzyme has

00:24:39.310 --> 00:24:41.800 align:middle line:90%
something to do with long life.

00:24:41.800 --> 00:24:45.610 align:middle line:84%
So their discovery
of this enzyme

00:24:45.610 --> 00:24:48.140 align:middle line:84%
is what the Nobel
Prize was awarded for.

00:24:48.140 --> 00:24:52.510 align:middle line:84%
The name of the enzyme tells the
whole story, it gives it away.

00:24:52.510 --> 00:24:56.110 align:middle line:84%
OK, the telomeres are what
determine how long the cell can

00:24:56.110 --> 00:24:57.490 align:middle line:90%
live and divide.

00:24:57.490 --> 00:25:01.510 align:middle line:84%
The enzyme they discovered
is called telomerase.

00:25:01.510 --> 00:25:04.930 align:middle line:84%
And the purpose of this
enzyme, the only purpose

00:25:04.930 --> 00:25:07.420 align:middle line:84%
of the telomerase
in our bodies is

00:25:07.420 --> 00:25:12.700 align:middle line:84%
to heal and repair the
telomeres at the end of our DNA.

00:25:12.700 --> 00:25:17.080 align:middle line:84%
The thing is, often
our telomerase is not

00:25:17.080 --> 00:25:20.660 align:middle line:84%
actively engaged in
its greatest potential.

00:25:20.660 --> 00:25:24.400 align:middle line:84%
It's dormant or if not
completely dormant,

00:25:24.400 --> 00:25:27.640 align:middle line:84%
it is not as active
as it can be.

00:25:27.640 --> 00:25:30.010 align:middle line:84%
Well, what scientists
found after they discovered

00:25:30.010 --> 00:25:32.440 align:middle line:84%
the telomeres,
they began looking

00:25:32.440 --> 00:25:34.990 align:middle line:84%
into the function
of the telomeres

00:25:34.990 --> 00:25:37.510 align:middle line:84%
and the telomerase
working together.

00:25:37.510 --> 00:25:39.610 align:middle line:90%
And once again, not my words.

00:25:39.610 --> 00:25:41.980 align:middle line:84%
I want to share with
you the exact words

00:25:41.980 --> 00:25:44.290 align:middle line:90%
of what it is that they found.

00:25:44.290 --> 00:25:46.900 align:middle line:84%
The National
Institutes of Health

00:25:46.900 --> 00:25:51.220 align:middle line:84%
produced a series of
articles in the year 2011.

00:25:51.220 --> 00:25:54.520 align:middle line:84%
I'm just going to share with you
two direct sentences from that.

00:25:54.520 --> 00:25:57.730 align:middle line:84%
Number one, they're saying
that the telomeres shortened

00:25:57.730 --> 00:25:58.530 align:middle line:90%
with age.

00:25:58.530 --> 00:26:01.150 align:middle line:84%
They say "telomere length
shortens with age."

00:26:01.150 --> 00:26:02.840 align:middle line:90%
That is a fact.

00:26:02.840 --> 00:26:05.650 align:middle line:84%
OK, the next
sentence is the key.

00:26:05.650 --> 00:26:09.460 align:middle line:10%
Because they say "The rate
of telomere shortening

00:26:09.460 --> 00:26:12.790 align:middle line:10%
can be either
increased or decreased

00:26:12.790 --> 00:26:16.330 align:middle line:10%
by specific lifestyle factors."

00:26:16.330 --> 00:26:19.390 align:middle line:10%
What that means is that
you and I have the ability

00:26:19.390 --> 00:26:22.750 align:middle line:10%
to make choices in our lives
that will either accelerate

00:26:22.750 --> 00:26:26.290 align:middle line:10%
the aging process,
senescence, old age and death,

00:26:26.290 --> 00:26:29.650 align:middle line:10%
or we make lifestyle
choices that breathe life

00:26:29.650 --> 00:26:33.190 align:middle line:10%
and activate these anti-aging
hormones and the telomerase

00:26:33.190 --> 00:26:33.999 align:middle line:10%
in our bodies.

00:26:33.999 --> 00:26:35.790 align:middle line:84%
And some of these
factors you already know.

00:26:35.790 --> 00:26:39.050 align:middle line:84%
Of course, diet,
exercise, lifestyle,

00:26:39.050 --> 00:26:40.750 align:middle line:90%
you know about those things.

00:26:40.750 --> 00:26:44.560 align:middle line:84%
But there's another factor
now that you already know,

00:26:44.560 --> 00:26:47.920 align:middle line:84%
but you may not
realize it is impacting

00:26:47.920 --> 00:26:52.120 align:middle line:90%
the duration of your cell life.

00:26:52.120 --> 00:26:54.550 align:middle line:84%
And that is the technique
of heart brain harmony

00:26:54.550 --> 00:26:56.830 align:middle line:84%
that we just learned
in the last episode.

00:26:56.830 --> 00:27:00.310 align:middle line:84%
Because that technique
of heart brain harmony,

00:27:00.310 --> 00:27:04.600 align:middle line:84%
as you activate that in
your life, what it's doing

00:27:04.600 --> 00:27:06.130 align:middle line:84%
is it setting up
the communication

00:27:06.130 --> 00:27:07.570 align:middle line:84%
between your heart
and your brain.

00:27:07.570 --> 00:27:09.850 align:middle line:84%
And your breathing
is telling your body

00:27:09.850 --> 00:27:11.740 align:middle line:84%
that you're in a
place that's safe.

00:27:11.740 --> 00:27:14.080 align:middle line:84%
And that is
redefining any stress

00:27:14.080 --> 00:27:15.460 align:middle line:90%
that you may feel in your body.

00:27:15.460 --> 00:27:18.970 align:middle line:84%
Remember stress is one of
the key factors to decreasing

00:27:18.970 --> 00:27:20.710 align:middle line:90%
the length of the telomeres.

00:27:20.710 --> 00:27:22.330 align:middle line:84%
So it's not just
about meditating,

00:27:22.330 --> 00:27:25.420 align:middle line:84%
and it's not just
about saying a chant,

00:27:25.420 --> 00:27:27.400 align:middle line:90%
although those things can help.

00:27:27.400 --> 00:27:33.040 align:middle line:84%
But it's about creating this
environment in our advanced

00:27:33.040 --> 00:27:37.390 align:middle line:84%
and extended neural network
that signals to our bodies

00:27:37.390 --> 00:27:40.420 align:middle line:84%
that we are in a
safe place where

00:27:40.420 --> 00:27:44.540 align:middle line:84%
it is OK to put all the
energy into the body

00:27:44.540 --> 00:27:49.480 align:middle line:84%
into the healing
regeneration and rejuvenation

00:27:49.480 --> 00:27:53.050 align:middle line:84%
rather than sending
that energy in defense

00:27:53.050 --> 00:27:57.490 align:middle line:84%
of the world around us
through the stress of cortisol

00:27:57.490 --> 00:27:58.540 align:middle line:90%
and adrenaline.

00:27:58.540 --> 00:28:01.120 align:middle line:90%
I know it's a big, big idea.

00:28:01.120 --> 00:28:03.520 align:middle line:84%
The bottom line is,
heart brain harmony

00:28:03.520 --> 00:28:05.240 align:middle line:90%
is a trigger for longevity.

00:28:05.240 --> 00:28:07.240 align:middle line:84%
Now what you're seeing
on your screen right now,

00:28:07.240 --> 00:28:09.156 align:middle line:84%
I didn't want you to
just take my word for it.

00:28:09.156 --> 00:28:10.570 align:middle line:90%
I want you to see this.

00:28:10.570 --> 00:28:13.030 align:middle line:90%
You're looking at telomeres.

00:28:13.030 --> 00:28:16.010 align:middle line:84%
These are photomicrographs
of telomeres.

00:28:16.010 --> 00:28:18.340 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to show you
a before and after.

00:28:18.340 --> 00:28:21.310 align:middle line:84%
This is a photograph
of telomeres

00:28:21.310 --> 00:28:23.410 align:middle line:90%
that are of advanced age.

00:28:23.410 --> 00:28:25.330 align:middle line:90%
There aren't many of them left.

00:28:25.330 --> 00:28:29.050 align:middle line:84%
They are the little pink areas
that you're seeing looking down

00:28:29.050 --> 00:28:33.110 align:middle line:90%
at the end of a strand of DNA.

00:28:33.110 --> 00:28:35.130 align:middle line:84%
And this is through
the aging process.

00:28:35.130 --> 00:28:37.870 align:middle line:84%
Now the next image
that you see is

00:28:37.870 --> 00:28:41.290 align:middle line:84%
going to be precisely
the same telomeres.

00:28:41.290 --> 00:28:45.530 align:middle line:84%
However, the telomerase
has been activated.

00:28:45.530 --> 00:28:48.790 align:middle line:84%
And when it's activated,
it will heal and reverse

00:28:48.790 --> 00:28:50.530 align:middle line:90%
the aging process.

00:28:50.530 --> 00:28:52.900 align:middle line:84%
And now you're
seeing it right here.

00:28:52.900 --> 00:28:54.220 align:middle line:90%
Look at this.

00:28:54.220 --> 00:28:58.000 align:middle line:84%
That is the same telomere
that now is rejuvenated.

00:28:58.000 --> 00:29:01.390 align:middle line:84%
What you're seeing
is anti-aging.

00:29:01.390 --> 00:29:04.420 align:middle line:84%
You're seeing it
real time in the DNA.

00:29:04.420 --> 00:29:05.710 align:middle line:90%
And this is human DNA.

00:29:05.710 --> 00:29:09.790 align:middle line:84%
What's possible in this slide
is possible in your body.

00:29:09.790 --> 00:29:13.060 align:middle line:84%
So modern science
is now revealing,

00:29:13.060 --> 00:29:17.320 align:middle line:84%
it's solving one of the deepest
mysteries of the greatest

00:29:17.320 --> 00:29:19.210 align:middle line:90%
truths of human existence.

00:29:19.210 --> 00:29:20.989 align:middle line:90%
We are literally wired.

00:29:20.989 --> 00:29:22.030 align:middle line:90%
I'm going to be personal.

00:29:22.030 --> 00:29:25.780 align:middle line:84%
You are wired to thrive
in life and to begin

00:29:25.780 --> 00:29:27.280 align:middle line:90%
healing of your body.

00:29:27.280 --> 00:29:29.450 align:middle line:84%
You begin the moment
that you're born.

00:29:29.450 --> 00:29:32.980 align:middle line:84%
And you can embrace that
at any time in your life.

00:29:32.980 --> 00:29:34.930 align:middle line:84%
In our next episode,
we're going to take

00:29:34.930 --> 00:29:39.010 align:middle line:84%
this idea of personal healing
to an even deeper level

00:29:39.010 --> 00:29:39.970 align:middle line:90%
with a bigger picture.

00:29:39.970 --> 00:29:42.910 align:middle line:84%
And in doing so, we'll
discover that the leading edge

00:29:42.910 --> 00:29:46.210 align:middle line:84%
science that tells us
our personal choices are

00:29:46.210 --> 00:29:49.030 align:middle line:84%
the key to global
cooperation and peace

00:29:49.030 --> 00:29:52.450 align:middle line:84%
are available to us in
our lives right now.
