>>GREGG BRADEN: Hello.

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:29.010 align:middle line:10%
My name's Gregg
Braden, and I'd like

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:32.700 align:middle line:10%
to welcome you to this very
special presentation of Missing

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:33.540 align:middle line:10%
Links--

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:35.220 align:middle line:10%
Simulation By Design.

00:00:35.220 --> 00:00:38.220 align:middle line:84%
Are We Living in
a Virtual Reality?

00:00:38.220 --> 00:00:40.830 align:middle line:84%
In the last episode, we
discovered that the key

00:00:40.830 --> 00:00:45.990 align:middle line:84%
to mastering our simulated world
is our ability to self-regulate

00:00:45.990 --> 00:00:47.790 align:middle line:90%
our inner experiences--

00:00:47.790 --> 00:00:50.910 align:middle line:84%
our thoughts, feelings,
emotions, and beliefs.

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:53.640 align:middle line:84%
In this episode, we're going
to go beyond our bodies

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:55.530 align:middle line:84%
to explore the
field that connects

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:58.230 align:middle line:84%
all things and the
master code that

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:00.780 align:middle line:84%
governs the patterns
of energy in our world

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:04.200 align:middle line:90%
as well as in our lives.

00:01:04.200 --> 00:01:08.500 align:middle line:10%
In 1949, the man known as the
father of modern computers

00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:10.980 align:middle line:10%
asked a question that
seemed off-the-charts

00:01:10.980 --> 00:01:12.660 align:middle line:10%
radical in his day.

00:01:12.660 --> 00:01:16.410 align:middle line:10%
The man's name was Konrad
Zuse, and his question

00:01:16.410 --> 00:01:19.110 align:middle line:10%
is actually the topic
of this entire series.

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:22.740 align:middle line:84%
Zuse asked if it's possible
that the universe operates

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:25.710 align:middle line:84%
just the way a
giant computer does,

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:28.710 align:middle line:84%
with a futuristic program
running somewhere out

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:31.590 align:middle line:84%
there in the universe that's
cranking out the energy

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:33.960 align:middle line:84%
and the information that
makes us what we are

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:36.030 align:middle line:90%
and our world as it is.

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:38.200 align:middle line:84%
In other words, in
today's language,

00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:41.610 align:middle line:84%
Zuse was asking if we are
living in a virtual world that

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:45.090 align:middle line:84%
operates like a 3D printer the
size of the whole universe.

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:47.550 align:middle line:90%
Wow, what a powerful question.

00:01:47.550 --> 00:01:51.015 align:middle line:84%
I can only imagine how
it was received in 1949,

00:01:51.015 --> 00:01:54.640 align:middle line:84%
but in recent times, we now
know that the answer to Zuse's

00:01:54.640 --> 00:01:56.790 align:middle line:90%
question is a resounding yes.

00:01:56.790 --> 00:02:00.220 align:middle line:84%
Not only is it possible, but as
we saw earlier in the series,

00:02:00.220 --> 00:02:04.410 align:middle line:84%
it's more likely than not that
we are living in a computer

00:02:04.410 --> 00:02:06.270 align:middle line:90%
simulation.

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:09.150 align:middle line:84%
Zuse was a man far
ahead of his time,

00:02:09.150 --> 00:02:11.550 align:middle line:84%
and his question didn't
make a lot of sense

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:14.670 align:middle line:84%
to the people of
his time until later

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:17.910 align:middle line:84%
in the 20th century, when
high-speed computers made

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:21.000 align:middle line:84%
it possible to run
simulated experiences

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:23.056 align:middle line:90%
in virtual realities.

00:02:23.056 --> 00:02:26.850 align:middle line:84%
As a testament to just how
powerful his ideas were,

00:02:26.850 --> 00:02:28.440 align:middle line:84%
it was Zuse's
thinking that formed

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:31.590 align:middle line:84%
the basis for the hugely
popular science fiction movie

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:34.080 align:middle line:90%
The Matrix in 1999.

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:36.210 align:middle line:84%
So for the rest of
this episode, I'd

00:02:36.210 --> 00:02:39.910 align:middle line:84%
like to explore Zuse's question
on a much deeper level.

00:02:39.910 --> 00:02:43.620 align:middle line:84%
I want to get into the nuts
and bolts of precisely how such

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:47.920 align:middle line:84%
a simulation could actually work
and what it means for us today.

00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:50.990 align:middle line:90%
Let's get started.

00:02:50.990 --> 00:02:53.320 align:middle line:84%
The key to mastering
our simulation

00:02:53.320 --> 00:02:55.300 align:middle line:84%
is that everything
in our world is

00:02:55.300 --> 00:02:57.580 align:middle line:84%
made of energy,
patterns of energy,

00:02:57.580 --> 00:03:00.550 align:middle line:84%
that can be thought
of as information.

00:03:00.550 --> 00:03:03.250 align:middle line:84%
Just the way the energy
from a television station

00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:06.250 align:middle line:84%
becomes information
to the television set

00:03:06.250 --> 00:03:07.750 align:middle line:84%
in your living
room or your laptop

00:03:07.750 --> 00:03:10.510 align:middle line:84%
or your iPad, the
energy that surrounds

00:03:10.510 --> 00:03:14.660 align:middle line:84%
us can be thought of as a
sea of living information.

00:03:14.660 --> 00:03:17.920 align:middle line:84%
So from mountains and rocks
and trees and flowers to you

00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:22.640 align:middle line:84%
and me and all life, everything
is made of this information.

00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:25.900 align:middle line:84%
The point here is that
for so much information

00:03:25.900 --> 00:03:29.020 align:middle line:84%
to be constantly
flowing and to continue

00:03:29.020 --> 00:03:31.630 align:middle line:84%
for such a long
period of time, there

00:03:31.630 --> 00:03:34.780 align:middle line:84%
must be a mechanism
that keeps things going,

00:03:34.780 --> 00:03:38.230 align:middle line:84%
a self-replicating,
self-sustaining code

00:03:38.230 --> 00:03:39.760 align:middle line:90%
of some kind.

00:03:39.760 --> 00:03:43.130 align:middle line:84%
That code was a
mystery until 1975,

00:03:43.130 --> 00:03:46.780 align:middle line:84%
when scientists discovered
the eloquent yet simple code

00:03:46.780 --> 00:03:48.940 align:middle line:84%
that we now know
exists at the most

00:03:48.940 --> 00:03:51.400 align:middle line:90%
fundamental levels of nature.

00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:54.310 align:middle line:84%
The code is called
a fractal, and it's

00:03:54.310 --> 00:03:56.420 align:middle line:90%
all about fractal patterns.

00:03:56.420 --> 00:03:59.170 align:middle line:84%
So let's take a look at
fractals, fractal patterns,

00:03:59.170 --> 00:04:03.460 align:middle line:84%
how they work, and what
they mean in our simulation.

00:04:03.460 --> 00:04:06.160 align:middle line:84%
A fractal can be thought
of as, number one,

00:04:06.160 --> 00:04:11.380 align:middle line:84%
a pattern that replicates itself
again and again and again.

00:04:11.380 --> 00:04:16.300 align:middle line:84%
Number two, a pattern that is
what is called self-similar

00:04:16.300 --> 00:04:18.050 align:middle line:90%
across different scales.

00:04:18.050 --> 00:04:20.709 align:middle line:84%
So in other words,
the pattern repeats

00:04:20.709 --> 00:04:24.640 align:middle line:84%
itself, the same pattern, from
the smallest levels of the atom

00:04:24.640 --> 00:04:28.330 align:middle line:84%
and even below to the largest
levels of our planet and even

00:04:28.330 --> 00:04:29.260 align:middle line:90%
beyond.

00:04:29.260 --> 00:04:31.400 align:middle line:90%
So here's what I mean.

00:04:31.400 --> 00:04:34.630 align:middle line:84%
If we look at an
atom, what we see

00:04:34.630 --> 00:04:38.410 align:middle line:84%
is an atom is made of
things, electrons, moving

00:04:38.410 --> 00:04:41.470 align:middle line:90%
around a thing, the nucleus.

00:04:41.470 --> 00:04:46.630 align:middle line:84%
So this is the pattern, things
are moving around things.

00:04:46.630 --> 00:04:49.180 align:middle line:84%
Now, if we look at a
planet with a moon,

00:04:49.180 --> 00:04:51.010 align:middle line:90%
we see the same pattern.

00:04:51.010 --> 00:04:54.880 align:middle line:84%
We see moons moving
around a planet,

00:04:54.880 --> 00:04:58.210 align:middle line:84%
just like electrons
moving around a nucleus,

00:04:58.210 --> 00:05:00.610 align:middle line:84%
except it's happening
on a much larger scale.

00:05:00.610 --> 00:05:03.420 align:middle line:84%
Now, if we go beyond that--
let's go to a solar system.

00:05:03.420 --> 00:05:07.940 align:middle line:84%
What we see are planets
moving around a sun.

00:05:07.940 --> 00:05:11.050 align:middle line:84%
It's the same pattern
as we saw for the atom,

00:05:11.050 --> 00:05:12.340 align:middle line:90%
but on a much larger scale.

00:05:12.340 --> 00:05:16.700 align:middle line:84%
And we can continue this
to the size of galaxies.

00:05:16.700 --> 00:05:20.680 align:middle line:84%
So the point here is that
the pattern is the same,

00:05:20.680 --> 00:05:25.850 align:middle line:84%
but it is repeating on
different scales of magnitude.

00:05:25.850 --> 00:05:29.260 align:middle line:84%
And we say that the pattern
is a fractal pattern.

00:05:29.260 --> 00:05:32.410 align:middle line:84%
So the atom is a
fractal pattern of what

00:05:32.410 --> 00:05:34.210 align:middle line:90%
we see in the solar system.

00:05:34.210 --> 00:05:36.220 align:middle line:84%
The solar system is
a fractal pattern

00:05:36.220 --> 00:05:38.470 align:middle line:90%
of what we see in a galaxy.

00:05:38.470 --> 00:05:41.470 align:middle line:84%
And the beauty of a fractal
and what makes it so powerful

00:05:41.470 --> 00:05:45.100 align:middle line:84%
is that if we understand
how the pattern of energy

00:05:45.100 --> 00:05:48.640 align:middle line:84%
works on the small scale,
it gives us insight

00:05:48.640 --> 00:05:51.130 align:middle line:84%
into what's happening
on the larger scale.

00:05:51.130 --> 00:05:54.280 align:middle line:84%
We understand the
relationship between electrons

00:05:54.280 --> 00:05:55.210 align:middle line:90%
and the nucleus.

00:05:55.210 --> 00:05:58.210 align:middle line:84%
It gives us insight into the
relationships between moons

00:05:58.210 --> 00:06:01.180 align:middle line:84%
and the planet or
planets and the sun.

00:06:01.180 --> 00:06:06.160 align:middle line:84%
So this is one example of
how fractal patterns play out

00:06:06.160 --> 00:06:12.190 align:middle line:84%
in nature on levels that
vary from the very small

00:06:12.190 --> 00:06:14.290 align:middle line:90%
to the very large.

00:06:14.290 --> 00:06:17.350 align:middle line:84%
The beauty of a fractal pattern
is that regardless of how

00:06:17.350 --> 00:06:22.000 align:middle line:84%
complex a fractal appears
to be, every one of them

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:25.360 align:middle line:84%
are made from a
very simple formula.

00:06:25.360 --> 00:06:29.050 align:middle line:84%
It is called a recursive
code, and you're looking at it

00:06:29.050 --> 00:06:31.096 align:middle line:90%
on your screen right now.

00:06:31.096 --> 00:06:32.470 align:middle line:84%
The code looks
like this, and I'm

00:06:32.470 --> 00:06:35.680 align:middle line:84%
going to just give you an
example with variables.

00:06:35.680 --> 00:06:38.650 align:middle line:84%
Z is the output of the
code on the left-hand side

00:06:38.650 --> 00:06:40.400 align:middle line:90%
of the equal sign.

00:06:40.400 --> 00:06:44.740 align:middle line:84%
On the right-hand side, we see
the actual code, the very, very

00:06:44.740 --> 00:06:49.540 align:middle line:84%
simple formula Z squared
plus C. And all this means

00:06:49.540 --> 00:06:53.890 align:middle line:84%
is that the information on
the right-hand side, as we

00:06:53.890 --> 00:06:58.180 align:middle line:84%
calculate that information
and it puts out

00:06:58.180 --> 00:07:02.110 align:middle line:84%
the result of that
calculation, that result

00:07:02.110 --> 00:07:05.770 align:middle line:84%
becomes the new input
for the next calculation.

00:07:05.770 --> 00:07:08.530 align:middle line:84%
So this code simply means that
the output of one calculation

00:07:08.530 --> 00:07:11.920 align:middle line:84%
becomes the input for the
next, and in this way,

00:07:11.920 --> 00:07:14.710 align:middle line:90%
the equation is self-sustaining.

00:07:14.710 --> 00:07:17.620 align:middle line:84%
And that's what makes
the fractal code so very

00:07:17.620 --> 00:07:20.830 align:middle line:90%
powerful in our simulation.

00:07:20.830 --> 00:07:23.230 align:middle line:84%
Once this code
was discovered, it

00:07:23.230 --> 00:07:25.960 align:middle line:84%
was recognized everywhere,
from the branches

00:07:25.960 --> 00:07:29.050 align:middle line:84%
of trees and plants to
the way rivers form.

00:07:29.050 --> 00:07:32.620 align:middle line:84%
The veins and the arteries
within our bodies,

00:07:32.620 --> 00:07:35.530 align:middle line:84%
the branching patterns of
the way the blood flows

00:07:35.530 --> 00:07:38.140 align:middle line:84%
within our bodies is
actually following

00:07:38.140 --> 00:07:40.390 align:middle line:90%
precisely the same pattern.

00:07:40.390 --> 00:07:43.610 align:middle line:84%
Even to the level of
how our cells reproduce.

00:07:43.610 --> 00:07:46.000 align:middle line:84%
So I'm giving you these
examples so that you

00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:50.790 align:middle line:84%
can see how it's
possible for one code

00:07:50.790 --> 00:07:55.350 align:middle line:84%
to sustain itself and
repeat itself seemingly

00:07:55.350 --> 00:07:58.980 align:middle line:84%
on an endless scale again
and again and again,

00:07:58.980 --> 00:08:01.800 align:middle line:84%
putting out new information
into the system.

00:08:01.800 --> 00:08:03.930 align:middle line:84%
This is the
fundamental code that

00:08:03.930 --> 00:08:06.300 align:middle line:90%
keeps our simulation running.

00:08:06.300 --> 00:08:07.390 align:middle line:90%
It is eloquent.

00:08:07.390 --> 00:08:08.280 align:middle line:90%
It is simple.

00:08:08.280 --> 00:08:11.580 align:middle line:90%
It is so beautiful.

00:08:11.580 --> 00:08:14.340 align:middle line:84%
So now that we understand
the code itself,

00:08:14.340 --> 00:08:18.310 align:middle line:84%
what I'd like to do is give you
a few examples of precisely how

00:08:18.310 --> 00:08:19.110 align:middle line:90%
this code works.

00:08:19.110 --> 00:08:21.930 align:middle line:84%
I want you to be very,
very clear in your mind

00:08:21.930 --> 00:08:23.870 align:middle line:90%
how this code is working.

00:08:23.870 --> 00:08:25.500 align:middle line:84%
And this is going
to be important,

00:08:25.500 --> 00:08:28.020 align:middle line:84%
because in future
episodes, we're

00:08:28.020 --> 00:08:31.980 align:middle line:84%
going to begin asking
questions about our simulation.

00:08:31.980 --> 00:08:33.150 align:middle line:90%
How long does it last?

00:08:33.150 --> 00:08:34.530 align:middle line:90%
How will it end?

00:08:34.530 --> 00:08:36.510 align:middle line:84%
And to answer those
kinds of questions,

00:08:36.510 --> 00:08:38.214 align:middle line:84%
we've got to
understand this code.

00:08:38.214 --> 00:08:40.630 align:middle line:84%
That's why I'm going to spend
a little bit of time sharing

00:08:40.630 --> 00:08:42.330 align:middle line:90%
this with you right now.

00:08:42.330 --> 00:08:44.550 align:middle line:10%
The image that you're
seeing on your screen

00:08:44.550 --> 00:08:48.630 align:middle line:10%
is going to help
understand this process.

00:08:48.630 --> 00:08:51.660 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to begin
with a straight line.

00:08:51.660 --> 00:08:54.820 align:middle line:10%
And in the center of
that straight line,

00:08:54.820 --> 00:09:00.510 align:middle line:10%
if we break the line apart and
we put an equal-sided triangle

00:09:00.510 --> 00:09:03.900 align:middle line:10%
in the center of the
line, that triangle

00:09:03.900 --> 00:09:07.640 align:middle line:10%
is the beginning of what
is called a Koch snowflake.

00:09:07.640 --> 00:09:11.700 align:middle line:10%
A Koch snowflake is an
example of a fractal pattern.

00:09:11.700 --> 00:09:17.170 align:middle line:10%
If we take each of the lines
that you now see on your screen

00:09:17.170 --> 00:09:21.690 align:middle line:10%
and in the midpoint of each
of those straight lines,

00:09:21.690 --> 00:09:25.980 align:middle line:10%
we place another triangle,
you see that the perimeter

00:09:25.980 --> 00:09:28.500 align:middle line:10%
is becoming more complex.

00:09:28.500 --> 00:09:32.730 align:middle line:10%
And if we do this again,
and again, and again, you

00:09:32.730 --> 00:09:35.340 align:middle line:10%
see that the simple
snowflake gets

00:09:35.340 --> 00:09:38.520 align:middle line:10%
very complex very, very fast.

00:09:38.520 --> 00:09:40.620 align:middle line:10%
I'm going to share
with you an animation

00:09:40.620 --> 00:09:43.560 align:middle line:10%
so you can see precisely
how this works,

00:09:43.560 --> 00:09:47.040 align:middle line:10%
so that you can see the
simplicity of the snowflake

00:09:47.040 --> 00:09:52.020 align:middle line:10%
going from very simple to
more complex, to more complex,

00:09:52.020 --> 00:09:53.850 align:middle line:10%
to more complex.

00:09:53.850 --> 00:09:55.980 align:middle line:10%
And this is important,
because as we

00:09:55.980 --> 00:10:00.720 align:middle line:10%
move beyond the static charts,
beyond the line drawings,

00:10:00.720 --> 00:10:07.290 align:middle line:10%
and you see in two dimensions
and you see the dynamics of how

00:10:07.290 --> 00:10:12.240 align:middle line:10%
this fractal pattern creates
this snowflake that becomes

00:10:12.240 --> 00:10:16.440 align:middle line:10%
more complex and
more complex, this

00:10:16.440 --> 00:10:19.530 align:middle line:10%
is an analogy for
what is actually

00:10:19.530 --> 00:10:21.810 align:middle line:10%
happening in our simulation.

00:10:21.810 --> 00:10:25.270 align:middle line:84%
We have patterns that begin
on a very simple level.

00:10:25.270 --> 00:10:28.110 align:middle line:84%
They become more
and more complex.

00:10:28.110 --> 00:10:32.220 align:middle line:84%
And I want you to notice how
the edges become more complex.

00:10:32.220 --> 00:10:33.870 align:middle line:90%
Here's the key.

00:10:33.870 --> 00:10:37.470 align:middle line:84%
The pattern itself doesn't
really change in size.

00:10:37.470 --> 00:10:39.750 align:middle line:90%
It stays pretty much the same.

00:10:39.750 --> 00:10:42.690 align:middle line:84%
That is a very, very
powerful concept.

00:10:42.690 --> 00:10:45.540 align:middle line:84%
Because what you're seeing
is an illustration of how

00:10:45.540 --> 00:10:49.980 align:middle line:84%
a simple code feeding
itself its own output

00:10:49.980 --> 00:10:54.120 align:middle line:84%
can continue calculations
for a long period of time

00:10:54.120 --> 00:10:57.990 align:middle line:84%
that seem to be indefinite,
but they're not.

00:10:57.990 --> 00:11:00.960 align:middle line:84%
This is precisely how
a simulation runs.

00:11:00.960 --> 00:11:04.320 align:middle line:84%
It continues to
process and calculate

00:11:04.320 --> 00:11:07.980 align:middle line:84%
until it reaches
some kind of limit,

00:11:07.980 --> 00:11:12.270 align:middle line:84%
either a limit of complexity
or a limit in time,

00:11:12.270 --> 00:11:16.302 align:middle line:84%
how long the process
can continue to run.

00:11:16.302 --> 00:11:17.760 align:middle line:84%
So I'm sharing
these ideas with you

00:11:17.760 --> 00:11:21.900 align:middle line:84%
now on the fractal
level of the snowflake

00:11:21.900 --> 00:11:25.560 align:middle line:84%
because what we begin to
understand on this level

00:11:25.560 --> 00:11:30.030 align:middle line:84%
is going to apply to our
entire simulation in our lives

00:11:30.030 --> 00:11:31.980 align:middle line:84%
and answer some of
the deepest questions

00:11:31.980 --> 00:11:33.930 align:middle line:84%
and solve some of the
greatest mysteries

00:11:33.930 --> 00:11:37.170 align:middle line:84%
that we're going to look
at in just a few minutes.

00:11:37.170 --> 00:11:40.680 align:middle line:84%
So it's precisely these
kinds of patterns,

00:11:40.680 --> 00:11:45.750 align:middle line:84%
these self-replicating
patterns, that we see in nature,

00:11:45.750 --> 00:11:47.130 align:middle line:90%
and we see it everywhere.

00:11:47.130 --> 00:11:49.320 align:middle line:84%
You see it on a
head of broccoli.

00:11:49.320 --> 00:11:51.390 align:middle line:84%
You see it in the
nautilus shell.

00:11:51.390 --> 00:11:55.030 align:middle line:84%
The chambers begin from the
center, and they unfold.

00:11:55.030 --> 00:11:57.550 align:middle line:84%
They become larger
and larger and larger,

00:11:57.550 --> 00:11:59.340 align:middle line:84%
but they're precisely
the same patterns.

00:11:59.340 --> 00:12:02.430 align:middle line:84%
You see it in the branching
patterns of rivers

00:12:02.430 --> 00:12:04.890 align:middle line:84%
and streams that you see
from satellite images.

00:12:04.890 --> 00:12:06.810 align:middle line:84%
And you see it as you
stand on the ground

00:12:06.810 --> 00:12:08.850 align:middle line:84%
and you look up to the
branches of the trees.

00:12:08.850 --> 00:12:11.550 align:middle line:90%


00:12:11.550 --> 00:12:14.590 align:middle line:84%
As different as those patterns
appear from one another,

00:12:14.590 --> 00:12:18.090 align:middle line:84%
they are based upon the same
principle-- a small pattern

00:12:18.090 --> 00:12:21.750 align:middle line:84%
repeating itself and
again on different scales.

00:12:21.750 --> 00:12:25.050 align:middle line:84%
This is the power of
the fractal patterns.

00:12:25.050 --> 00:12:30.510 align:middle line:84%
What scientists found in 1975
was that this pattern, in fact,

00:12:30.510 --> 00:12:35.100 align:middle line:84%
was so much closer to the
way that nature actually

00:12:35.100 --> 00:12:39.900 align:middle line:84%
works that this thinking now
has replaced the old ideas when

00:12:39.900 --> 00:12:42.990 align:middle line:90%
it comes to the natural world.

00:12:42.990 --> 00:12:44.940 align:middle line:84%
Remember when we
were kids and we

00:12:44.940 --> 00:12:48.100 align:middle line:84%
used to draw a
picture of a tree,

00:12:48.100 --> 00:12:51.810 align:middle line:84%
and the tree used to be a stick
with a circle on top of it?

00:12:51.810 --> 00:12:54.810 align:middle line:84%
We were using geometric
patterns that we

00:12:54.810 --> 00:12:59.520 align:middle line:84%
know to create and replicate
the nature that we see.

00:12:59.520 --> 00:13:01.650 align:middle line:90%
So they were approximations.

00:13:01.650 --> 00:13:05.250 align:middle line:84%
Well, a stick with a
circle on top of it

00:13:05.250 --> 00:13:09.450 align:middle line:84%
to approximate a tree, I think
you'll agree, is simply that.

00:13:09.450 --> 00:13:10.710 align:middle line:90%
It is an approximation.

00:13:10.710 --> 00:13:12.630 align:middle line:84%
We have to use our
imagination to make

00:13:12.630 --> 00:13:15.930 align:middle line:84%
the link between that
representation and the tree

00:13:15.930 --> 00:13:18.290 align:middle line:84%
that we actually
see in our backyard.

00:13:18.290 --> 00:13:21.000 align:middle line:84%
But what scientists
found in 1975,

00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:25.020 align:middle line:84%
they no longer needed to make
those kinds of approximations.

00:13:25.020 --> 00:13:30.170 align:middle line:84%
Because the fractal geometry,
the fractal mathematics

00:13:30.170 --> 00:13:34.080 align:middle line:84%
that I've just shared with
you, replicates nature almost

00:13:34.080 --> 00:13:39.660 align:middle line:84%
to a T. So now, scientists are
using these fractal patterns

00:13:39.660 --> 00:13:42.060 align:middle line:84%
to represent the
natural world in ways

00:13:42.060 --> 00:13:44.402 align:middle line:90%
that we've never done before.

00:13:44.402 --> 00:13:47.198 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:13:47.198 --> 00:13:48.600 align:middle line:90%


00:13:48.600 --> 00:13:52.380 align:middle line:84%
In fact, this code reproduces
nature so well that we often

00:13:52.380 --> 00:13:56.760 align:middle line:84%
cannot even tell a fractal
generated image from the real

00:13:56.760 --> 00:13:57.780 align:middle line:90%
thing.

00:13:57.780 --> 00:14:00.900 align:middle line:84%
And you've already seen this,
because in the first episode

00:14:00.900 --> 00:14:05.700 align:middle line:84%
of this series, I shared with
you a series of natural images.

00:14:05.700 --> 00:14:07.020 align:middle line:90%
I showed you mountains.

00:14:07.020 --> 00:14:08.700 align:middle line:90%
Some of them had snow.

00:14:08.700 --> 00:14:11.190 align:middle line:84%
Some of them were covered
with green forest.

00:14:11.190 --> 00:14:14.580 align:middle line:84%
And I asked you, are
these photographs,

00:14:14.580 --> 00:14:16.990 align:middle line:84%
are these real
images, or are they

00:14:16.990 --> 00:14:20.550 align:middle line:84%
digital images that have
been reproduced artificially?

00:14:20.550 --> 00:14:24.120 align:middle line:84%
Now, I can explain to an even
greater degree what I was

00:14:24.120 --> 00:14:26.640 align:middle line:90%
showing you in those images.

00:14:26.640 --> 00:14:29.370 align:middle line:84%
Every one of those
was a fractal image.

00:14:29.370 --> 00:14:34.870 align:middle line:84%
It was produced from the code
Z equals Z squared plus C.

00:14:34.870 --> 00:14:38.100 align:middle line:84%
So what happens with
that code, Z squared--

00:14:38.100 --> 00:14:41.190 align:middle line:90%
we give the Z a value.

00:14:41.190 --> 00:14:43.560 align:middle line:84%
And then we take that
value times itself,

00:14:43.560 --> 00:14:47.700 align:middle line:84%
Z squared, and we
add another value.

00:14:47.700 --> 00:14:50.430 align:middle line:84%
And the output from
that calculation

00:14:50.430 --> 00:14:54.810 align:middle line:84%
becomes the input for
the next calculation.

00:14:54.810 --> 00:14:58.580 align:middle line:84%
And it continues again
and again and again,

00:14:58.580 --> 00:15:02.790 align:middle line:84%
this self-replicating
code that feeds itself.

00:15:02.790 --> 00:15:05.140 align:middle line:84%
Again, seemingly on
an infinite level.

00:15:05.140 --> 00:15:07.780 align:middle line:84%
We're going to see in a moment
it's not quite infinite.

00:15:07.780 --> 00:15:11.370 align:middle line:84%
And that's why it's important
to understand this when

00:15:11.370 --> 00:15:13.900 align:middle line:90%
it comes to our simulation.

00:15:13.900 --> 00:15:16.200 align:middle line:10%
So what I want you
to see right now

00:15:16.200 --> 00:15:19.440 align:middle line:10%
is that this idea of
a fractal code, it

00:15:19.440 --> 00:15:24.120 align:middle line:10%
appears to approximate nature
so well that scientists now

00:15:24.120 --> 00:15:28.320 align:middle line:10%
believe that this is the
fundamental code that underlies

00:15:28.320 --> 00:15:30.520 align:middle line:10%
all of the natural world.

00:15:30.520 --> 00:15:34.980 align:middle line:84%
It is this code that directs
the cells of our bodies

00:15:34.980 --> 00:15:39.420 align:middle line:84%
or the atoms of physical
matter or the molecules

00:15:39.420 --> 00:15:40.500 align:middle line:90%
of physical matter.

00:15:40.500 --> 00:15:43.890 align:middle line:84%
It directs how
they are combining

00:15:43.890 --> 00:15:45.960 align:middle line:84%
to produce the
patterns and the images

00:15:45.960 --> 00:15:48.280 align:middle line:84%
that we see in
the natural world.

00:15:48.280 --> 00:15:52.230 align:middle line:84%
So in reality, as complex
as our world looks,

00:15:52.230 --> 00:15:56.070 align:middle line:84%
we're really looking at a
few very simple patterns

00:15:56.070 --> 00:15:58.160 align:middle line:90%
that are self-replicating.

00:15:58.160 --> 00:16:02.140 align:middle line:84%
You repeat on varying
scales of magnitude.

00:16:02.140 --> 00:16:06.400 align:middle line:84%
And that is precisely the
hallmark of a simulation.

00:16:06.400 --> 00:16:09.600 align:middle line:84%
This is how a computer
simulation works.

00:16:09.600 --> 00:16:14.910 align:middle line:84%
Mathematic codes are used
to continually put out

00:16:14.910 --> 00:16:18.450 align:middle line:84%
the information, to spew
out this information.

00:16:18.450 --> 00:16:21.240 align:middle line:84%
And the information is what
we see as the physical reality

00:16:21.240 --> 00:16:22.749 align:middle line:90%
of our world.

00:16:22.749 --> 00:16:25.290 align:middle line:84%
I know, for some people, it's
a very, very different concept,

00:16:25.290 --> 00:16:29.625 align:middle line:84%
and we think of
energy as information.

00:16:29.625 --> 00:16:34.080 align:middle line:84%
But the energy of our world is
nothing more than information,

00:16:34.080 --> 00:16:37.830 align:middle line:84%
and that is going to be very
important when we consider

00:16:37.830 --> 00:16:41.640 align:middle line:84%
our simulation, how it
began, how long it lasts,

00:16:41.640 --> 00:16:43.740 align:middle line:90%
and what happens when it ends.

00:16:43.740 --> 00:16:46.260 align:middle line:84%
So we're building a
vocabulary right now so we can

00:16:46.260 --> 00:16:49.200 align:middle line:90%
have this conversation shortly.

00:16:49.200 --> 00:16:54.300 align:middle line:84%
So when we apply this idea
of a simple recursive fractal

00:16:54.300 --> 00:16:57.750 align:middle line:84%
code to our
simulated reality, we

00:16:57.750 --> 00:17:01.240 align:middle line:84%
discover some very
powerful implications.

00:17:01.240 --> 00:17:04.619 align:middle line:84%
Let's go back to our
familiar Koch snowflake

00:17:04.619 --> 00:17:07.770 align:middle line:84%
so that I can show you
exactly what I mean here.

00:17:07.770 --> 00:17:11.450 align:middle line:84%
There are two big questions
that frequently come up

00:17:11.450 --> 00:17:14.520 align:middle line:84%
when we talk about us
living in a simulation.

00:17:14.520 --> 00:17:19.079 align:middle line:84%
First question is, what are
the limits of our simulation?

00:17:19.079 --> 00:17:20.190 align:middle line:90%
How long can it last?

00:17:20.190 --> 00:17:24.190 align:middle line:84%
Are we limited in terms
of the simulation's size?

00:17:24.190 --> 00:17:27.869 align:middle line:84%
And after all, if the
universe continues to expand,

00:17:27.869 --> 00:17:30.540 align:middle line:90%
how big can it really become?

00:17:30.540 --> 00:17:33.090 align:middle line:84%
Question number two,
if we are limited,

00:17:33.090 --> 00:17:35.310 align:middle line:84%
how long can this
simulation continue

00:17:35.310 --> 00:17:38.450 align:middle line:84%
to run before we
reach that limit?

00:17:38.450 --> 00:17:39.450 align:middle line:90%
These are big questions.

00:17:39.450 --> 00:17:41.340 align:middle line:90%
The implications are huge.

00:17:41.340 --> 00:17:46.500 align:middle line:84%
And our Koch snowflake gives
us the clues to both answers.

00:17:46.500 --> 00:17:48.030 align:middle line:84%
And they may
surprise you as much

00:17:48.030 --> 00:17:52.470 align:middle line:84%
as they did scientists that
discovered them in 1975.

00:17:52.470 --> 00:17:57.180 align:middle line:84%
So let me first summarize what
this snowflake is showing us.

00:17:57.180 --> 00:18:01.120 align:middle line:84%
The mathematics show us
that there is, in fact,

00:18:01.120 --> 00:18:04.410 align:middle line:84%
a limit when it
comes to the area

00:18:04.410 --> 00:18:06.360 align:middle line:90%
that the snowflake may occupy.

00:18:06.360 --> 00:18:09.920 align:middle line:84%
However, there
appears to be no limit

00:18:09.920 --> 00:18:14.610 align:middle line:84%
as to how complex the edges
of that area can become.

00:18:14.610 --> 00:18:16.710 align:middle line:84%
So let me repeat
what I just said.

00:18:16.710 --> 00:18:19.830 align:middle line:10%
There appears to
be no limit when

00:18:19.830 --> 00:18:24.630 align:middle line:10%
it comes to how complex
the edges of our pattern,

00:18:24.630 --> 00:18:26.760 align:middle line:10%
of our snowflake, can become.

00:18:26.760 --> 00:18:30.030 align:middle line:84%
But there is a limit to
how large it can grow.

00:18:30.030 --> 00:18:32.190 align:middle line:90%
And here's what I mean.

00:18:32.190 --> 00:18:35.760 align:middle line:84%
With the first iteration
of the fractal code

00:18:35.760 --> 00:18:38.190 align:middle line:84%
to create the
snowflake, the area

00:18:38.190 --> 00:18:41.000 align:middle line:90%
increased by a specific amount.

00:18:41.000 --> 00:18:43.510 align:middle line:90%
It was by a factor of one third.

00:18:43.510 --> 00:18:47.860 align:middle line:84%
Now, with the second iteration,
the area still increases,

00:18:47.860 --> 00:18:50.250 align:middle line:84%
but it increases to
a much lesser degree.

00:18:50.250 --> 00:18:54.000 align:middle line:90%
It's actually only 4/27.

00:18:54.000 --> 00:18:57.360 align:middle line:84%
That is the fractional
degree of the increase.

00:18:57.360 --> 00:19:00.780 align:middle line:84%
The third iteration when
we're building those triangles

00:19:00.780 --> 00:19:04.920 align:middle line:84%
along the flat edges,
that third iteration

00:19:04.920 --> 00:19:10.890 align:middle line:84%
increases by an even
smaller amount of 16/243,

00:19:10.890 --> 00:19:17.796 align:middle line:84%
and the fourth iteration by a
factor of 64/2187, and so on.

00:19:17.796 --> 00:19:19.170 align:middle line:84%
So you see what's
happening here.

00:19:19.170 --> 00:19:20.400 align:middle line:90%
You can see the trend.

00:19:20.400 --> 00:19:21.750 align:middle line:90%
It's clear.

00:19:21.750 --> 00:19:25.410 align:middle line:84%
The numbers that
represent the area

00:19:25.410 --> 00:19:28.170 align:middle line:84%
are getting smaller
and smaller, and they

00:19:28.170 --> 00:19:30.720 align:middle line:90%
seem to be moving towards zero.

00:19:30.720 --> 00:19:34.200 align:middle line:84%
So intuitively, this
is precisely where we'd

00:19:34.200 --> 00:19:36.520 align:middle line:90%
expect those numbers to go.

00:19:36.520 --> 00:19:39.960 align:middle line:84%
However, this is where things
get really, really interesting.

00:19:39.960 --> 00:19:44.580 align:middle line:10%
Because if we plot this
information on a graph, if we

00:19:44.580 --> 00:19:51.540 align:middle line:10%
plot on a graph the complexity
and how the size is changing,

00:19:51.540 --> 00:19:55.710 align:middle line:10%
what we see is that the change
does not continue indefinitely.

00:19:55.710 --> 00:19:59.490 align:middle line:10%
It actually levels out
at a specific size.

00:19:59.490 --> 00:20:02.430 align:middle line:10%
And you're going to find
this size very interesting.

00:20:02.430 --> 00:20:07.680 align:middle line:84%
The growth levels out
at 1.6 times the area

00:20:07.680 --> 00:20:09.000 align:middle line:90%
of the original triangle.

00:20:09.000 --> 00:20:10.870 align:middle line:90%
1.6.

00:20:10.870 --> 00:20:13.260 align:middle line:84%
Those of you watching this,
if you watch a lot of Gaia,

00:20:13.260 --> 00:20:14.843 align:middle line:84%
I know you've seen
this number before.

00:20:14.843 --> 00:20:16.710 align:middle line:90%
It's a very significant number.

00:20:16.710 --> 00:20:21.650 align:middle line:84%
It's part of a series that
we see commonly in nature.

00:20:21.650 --> 00:20:23.490 align:middle line:84%
We also see it in our
bodies, and we see it

00:20:23.490 --> 00:20:25.270 align:middle line:90%
in living systems.

00:20:25.270 --> 00:20:28.410 align:middle line:84%
It's part of a series that
is known as the Fibonacci

00:20:28.410 --> 00:20:29.840 align:middle line:90%
mathematic series.

00:20:29.840 --> 00:20:31.950 align:middle line:90%
1.6.

00:20:31.950 --> 00:20:35.640 align:middle line:10%
So what we're saying here
is that the area of our Koch

00:20:35.640 --> 00:20:39.510 align:middle line:10%
snowflake does have
a limit in terms

00:20:39.510 --> 00:20:44.520 align:middle line:10%
of how large it can become and
how much space it can occupy.

00:20:44.520 --> 00:20:46.220 align:middle line:90%
I'm going to pause right there.

00:20:46.220 --> 00:20:48.250 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to pause
and invite you now

00:20:48.250 --> 00:20:51.570 align:middle line:84%
to think about this in
terms of our simulation.

00:20:51.570 --> 00:20:54.210 align:middle line:84%
What this snowflake
is telling us

00:20:54.210 --> 00:20:57.060 align:middle line:84%
is that our simulation
has a limit in terms

00:20:57.060 --> 00:21:01.350 align:middle line:84%
of how large it can become and
how much space it can occupy.

00:21:01.350 --> 00:21:02.160 align:middle line:90%
All right?

00:21:02.160 --> 00:21:04.980 align:middle line:10%
Now, the perimeter
of the snowflake,

00:21:04.980 --> 00:21:06.720 align:middle line:10%
remember, the
perimeter is getting

00:21:06.720 --> 00:21:09.570 align:middle line:10%
more and more and more complex.

00:21:09.570 --> 00:21:11.790 align:middle line:10%
It tells us a different story.

00:21:11.790 --> 00:21:14.850 align:middle line:10%
The number of times
that the perimeter

00:21:14.850 --> 00:21:17.551 align:middle line:10%
can change to
become more complex,

00:21:17.551 --> 00:21:19.050 align:middle line:10%
the number of those
little triangles

00:21:19.050 --> 00:21:21.480 align:middle line:10%
that we can put
on that perimeter

00:21:21.480 --> 00:21:25.740 align:middle line:10%
as the edges become more
and more and more complex,

00:21:25.740 --> 00:21:27.120 align:middle line:10%
is infinite.

00:21:27.120 --> 00:21:27.920 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:21:27.920 --> 00:21:29.370 align:middle line:90%
And this is good news for us.

00:21:29.370 --> 00:21:33.750 align:middle line:84%
This fact is a key to
understanding our simulation,

00:21:33.750 --> 00:21:35.790 align:middle line:90%
and here's the reason why.

00:21:35.790 --> 00:21:38.640 align:middle line:84%
The rhythms of nature
in the natural world

00:21:38.640 --> 00:21:43.020 align:middle line:84%
and the universe all appear
to be governed by cycles.

00:21:43.020 --> 00:21:46.830 align:middle line:84%
And the limits that follow
this recursive code,

00:21:46.830 --> 00:21:50.700 align:middle line:84%
this suggests that our
simulated world does, in fact,

00:21:50.700 --> 00:21:55.260 align:middle line:84%
have limits, both in terms of
how much area the universe may

00:21:55.260 --> 00:21:59.820 align:middle line:84%
occupy and how long
our simulation lasts.

00:21:59.820 --> 00:22:03.360 align:middle line:84%
However, it also suggests
that the possibilities

00:22:03.360 --> 00:22:07.210 align:middle line:84%
of our experience within these
boundaries-- in other words,

00:22:07.210 --> 00:22:10.830 align:middle line:84%
how complex our
perimeter may become--

00:22:10.830 --> 00:22:14.020 align:middle line:90%
is infinite.

00:22:14.020 --> 00:22:17.940 align:middle line:84%
So I'm sharing this
with you as theory

00:22:17.940 --> 00:22:20.200 align:middle line:84%
so that you can see the
fundamental patterns,

00:22:20.200 --> 00:22:22.180 align:middle line:84%
the mathematics,
the recursive code,

00:22:22.180 --> 00:22:26.620 align:middle line:90%
the fractal patterns in nature.

00:22:26.620 --> 00:22:30.670 align:middle line:84%
And now we're taking the ideas
that the fractal patterns are

00:22:30.670 --> 00:22:32.920 align:middle line:84%
showing us on a small
scale, and we're

00:22:32.920 --> 00:22:36.490 align:middle line:84%
applying them to the large
scale of our simulation.

00:22:36.490 --> 00:22:39.160 align:middle line:84%
What we're saying is
that there are limits,

00:22:39.160 --> 00:22:41.345 align:middle line:84%
and I want you to know
that those limits now

00:22:41.345 --> 00:22:42.145 align:middle line:90%
are recognized.

00:22:42.145 --> 00:22:44.430 align:middle line:84%
And some of the greatest
minds in physics

00:22:44.430 --> 00:22:46.840 align:middle line:84%
agree with everything
that we're saying here.

00:22:46.840 --> 00:22:50.665 align:middle line:10%
I want you to hear Stephen
Hawking in a conversation

00:22:50.665 --> 00:22:53.630 align:middle line:10%
that he was having with a
number of other physicists.

00:22:53.630 --> 00:22:56.660 align:middle line:10%
A portion of that
conversation was recorded.

00:22:56.660 --> 00:22:58.490 align:middle line:10%
I'm going to play that
for you right now.

00:22:58.490 --> 00:23:00.400 align:middle line:84%
In the case of the
universe, there

00:23:00.400 --> 00:23:03.390 align:middle line:90%
seems to be a limiting scale.

00:23:03.390 --> 00:23:05.680 align:middle line:84%
It is called the
Planck length, and it's

00:23:05.680 --> 00:23:10.210 align:middle line:84%
about a million billion billion
times smaller than an inch.

00:23:10.210 --> 00:23:14.050 align:middle line:84%
This means that there is a limit
to how complex the universe can

00:23:14.050 --> 00:23:15.350 align:middle line:90%
be.

00:23:15.350 --> 00:23:17.410 align:middle line:10%
It also means that
the universe could

00:23:17.410 --> 00:23:20.950 align:middle line:10%
be described by a theory that
is fairly simple, at least

00:23:20.950 --> 00:23:23.960 align:middle line:10%
on scales of the Planck length.

00:23:23.960 --> 00:23:28.580 align:middle line:84%
I just hope that we are
smart enough to find it.

00:23:28.580 --> 00:23:33.290 align:middle line:84%
>> So we just used this Koch
snowflake to illustrate these

00:23:33.290 --> 00:23:36.020 align:middle line:84%
ideas of limits and
complexity when it comes

00:23:36.020 --> 00:23:37.880 align:middle line:90%
to our simulation.

00:23:37.880 --> 00:23:40.370 align:middle line:84%
And I did this
specifically so that we

00:23:40.370 --> 00:23:43.250 align:middle line:84%
could illustrate the principles
that Stephen Hawking has just

00:23:43.250 --> 00:23:44.600 align:middle line:90%
talked about.

00:23:44.600 --> 00:23:46.880 align:middle line:84%
You're probably familiar
with these ideas

00:23:46.880 --> 00:23:49.789 align:middle line:84%
from another pattern that
is seen much more commonly.

00:23:49.789 --> 00:23:51.830 align:middle line:10%
The image that you're
seeing on your screen right

00:23:51.830 --> 00:23:54.290 align:middle line:10%
now is called the
Mandelbrot set.

00:23:54.290 --> 00:23:57.920 align:middle line:10%
The Mandelbrot set
is also the output

00:23:57.920 --> 00:24:00.500 align:middle line:10%
from that fractal code,
that fractal pattern

00:24:00.500 --> 00:24:02.120 align:middle line:10%
that we just looked at.

00:24:02.120 --> 00:24:05.390 align:middle line:84%
And it shows us
something else that

00:24:05.390 --> 00:24:10.170 align:middle line:84%
is very key when we talk about
the limits of our experience

00:24:10.170 --> 00:24:12.890 align:middle line:84%
and we talk about the
limits of our simulation.

00:24:12.890 --> 00:24:15.500 align:middle line:90%


00:24:15.500 --> 00:24:20.850 align:middle line:84%
When the numbers of the fractal
code become very, very small

00:24:20.850 --> 00:24:23.520 align:middle line:84%
and they are plotted
as the Mandelbrot set,

00:24:23.520 --> 00:24:26.700 align:middle line:84%
they are bound within what
you see as the black pattern

00:24:26.700 --> 00:24:28.540 align:middle line:90%
on your screen.

00:24:28.540 --> 00:24:32.010 align:middle line:84%
So in this case,
the fractal pattern

00:24:32.010 --> 00:24:36.330 align:middle line:90%
is creating patterns of space.

00:24:36.330 --> 00:24:37.230 align:middle line:90%
All right?

00:24:37.230 --> 00:24:40.230 align:middle line:84%
And depending on the values
that go into the pattern,

00:24:40.230 --> 00:24:44.080 align:middle line:84%
the space can become very
large or can become very small.

00:24:44.080 --> 00:24:45.850 align:middle line:84%
So when the numbers
are very small,

00:24:45.850 --> 00:24:47.490 align:middle line:84%
they're bound by
the black pattern.

00:24:47.490 --> 00:24:49.740 align:middle line:84%
When they become
very large, they're

00:24:49.740 --> 00:24:52.680 align:middle line:84%
represented by what you see
as the colored portion, which

00:24:52.680 --> 00:24:55.030 align:middle line:90%
expands indefinitely.

00:24:55.030 --> 00:24:57.060 align:middle line:84%
So once again, what
we're saying is

00:24:57.060 --> 00:25:01.740 align:middle line:84%
that our experience
within this pattern

00:25:01.740 --> 00:25:04.710 align:middle line:84%
appears to be-- the opportunity
for our experience appears

00:25:04.710 --> 00:25:06.480 align:middle line:90%
to be infinite.

00:25:06.480 --> 00:25:09.900 align:middle line:84%
But the space that our
simulation occupies

00:25:09.900 --> 00:25:11.740 align:middle line:90%
appears to be finite.

00:25:11.740 --> 00:25:14.940 align:middle line:84%
And this is why the
Mandelbrot set is so powerful.

00:25:14.940 --> 00:25:18.570 align:middle line:84%
When we zoom in to
the Mandelbrot set,

00:25:18.570 --> 00:25:20.730 align:middle line:84%
the deeper and
deeper and deeper we

00:25:20.730 --> 00:25:23.460 align:middle line:84%
go into the pattern,
what we see is

00:25:23.460 --> 00:25:25.710 align:middle line:84%
that the patterns
continue to repeat

00:25:25.710 --> 00:25:27.930 align:middle line:90%
the hallmark of a fractal.

00:25:27.930 --> 00:25:31.350 align:middle line:84%
They repeat themselves
again and again and again

00:25:31.350 --> 00:25:33.300 align:middle line:90%
on infinitely smaller scales.

00:25:41.210 --> 00:25:45.960 align:middle line:84%
So let's take this out of the
realm of mathematics and images

00:25:45.960 --> 00:25:46.760 align:middle line:90%
on the screen.

00:25:46.760 --> 00:25:49.990 align:middle line:84%
Let's think about these patterns
in terms of our lives fractal

00:25:49.990 --> 00:25:53.020 align:middle line:84%
patterns repeat again
and on different scales.

00:25:53.020 --> 00:25:54.550 align:middle line:90%
You and I already know that.

00:25:54.550 --> 00:25:57.010 align:middle line:84%
You know that when you have
a pattern in your life,

00:25:57.010 --> 00:25:59.470 align:middle line:84%
when you have a pattern
in your relationships

00:25:59.470 --> 00:26:04.750 align:middle line:84%
and you are with one person in
one job with one company in one

00:26:04.750 --> 00:26:06.910 align:middle line:84%
city and things
aren't working well,

00:26:06.910 --> 00:26:08.380 align:middle line:84%
how many times have
you seen people

00:26:08.380 --> 00:26:10.270 align:middle line:90%
that say, OK, I need a change.

00:26:10.270 --> 00:26:12.790 align:middle line:84%
So they go to another city,
they find another partner,

00:26:12.790 --> 00:26:14.980 align:middle line:84%
another job, another
company, but they

00:26:14.980 --> 00:26:17.950 align:middle line:84%
find that the same patterns
are showing up in their lives

00:26:17.950 --> 00:26:19.180 align:middle line:90%
again and again and again.

00:26:19.180 --> 00:26:21.940 align:middle line:84%
And they say, well,
I didn't choose well.

00:26:21.940 --> 00:26:25.690 align:middle line:84%
Let me make another change,
another city, another job,

00:26:25.690 --> 00:26:27.970 align:middle line:84%
another company,
another partner.

00:26:27.970 --> 00:26:30.640 align:middle line:84%
How many times do we do
this before we realize

00:26:30.640 --> 00:26:33.220 align:middle line:84%
that no matter where we
go, the same patterns are

00:26:33.220 --> 00:26:36.430 align:middle line:84%
going to show up in our lives
again and again and again?

00:26:36.430 --> 00:26:37.810 align:middle line:90%
Now you know the reason.

00:26:37.810 --> 00:26:42.310 align:middle line:84%
The reason is because we
are living fractal patterns

00:26:42.310 --> 00:26:44.030 align:middle line:90%
in our biology.

00:26:44.030 --> 00:26:46.930 align:middle line:84%
We're living fractal
patterns in our emotions.

00:26:46.930 --> 00:26:50.770 align:middle line:84%
We're living fractal patterns
in our relationships.

00:26:50.770 --> 00:26:54.790 align:middle line:84%
Because the energy
of our simulation,

00:26:54.790 --> 00:26:56.830 align:middle line:84%
the information
of our simulation,

00:26:56.830 --> 00:27:02.050 align:middle line:84%
is governed by the fractal
code, that fractal formula.

00:27:02.050 --> 00:27:04.060 align:middle line:84%
And the beauty of
knowing this is

00:27:04.060 --> 00:27:09.497 align:middle line:84%
once we change that variable,
once we shift the way we think,

00:27:09.497 --> 00:27:11.080 align:middle line:84%
the way we solve our
problems, the way

00:27:11.080 --> 00:27:14.650 align:middle line:84%
we think of ourselves, once
we change our self-esteem,

00:27:14.650 --> 00:27:17.800 align:middle line:84%
once we change the way we
value our lives or the way

00:27:17.800 --> 00:27:21.100 align:middle line:84%
we value other people, that's
the equivalent of changing

00:27:21.100 --> 00:27:22.780 align:middle line:90%
the variable in the code.

00:27:22.780 --> 00:27:26.800 align:middle line:84%
Now we're writing a new
code, and the new patterns

00:27:26.800 --> 00:27:29.020 align:middle line:84%
are going to repeat again
and again and again.

00:27:29.020 --> 00:27:32.190 align:middle line:84%
If they're healthy patterns,
that's a really good thing.

00:27:32.190 --> 00:27:37.750 align:middle line:84%
So I'm illustrating how
our experience is actually

00:27:37.750 --> 00:27:41.620 align:middle line:84%
following the code that governs
the energy and the information

00:27:41.620 --> 00:27:43.480 align:middle line:90%
of our entire simulation.

00:27:43.480 --> 00:27:45.700 align:middle line:84%
It's a very, very
powerful way to think

00:27:45.700 --> 00:27:48.760 align:middle line:84%
about our lives and our world
and what we're experiencing

00:27:48.760 --> 00:27:50.710 align:middle line:90%
in our virtual reality.

00:27:50.710 --> 00:27:53.290 align:middle line:84%
Now that we understand
the simple mechanism that

00:27:53.290 --> 00:27:57.850 align:middle line:84%
allows our simulation to sustain
itself, the fractal code,

00:27:57.850 --> 00:27:59.800 align:middle line:84%
it makes perfect
sense that we would

00:27:59.800 --> 00:28:03.520 align:middle line:84%
have the inner tools to
master our simulation in order

00:28:03.520 --> 00:28:07.840 align:middle line:84%
to live the best lives and to
create the best world possible.

00:28:07.840 --> 00:28:10.120 align:middle line:84%
To awaken our tools,
however, we now

00:28:10.120 --> 00:28:13.810 align:middle line:84%
need to go one step further to
understand the rules that are

00:28:13.810 --> 00:28:15.860 align:middle line:90%
created by the fractal code.

00:28:15.860 --> 00:28:18.880 align:middle line:84%
And fortunately for us,
300 years of science

00:28:18.880 --> 00:28:22.120 align:middle line:84%
and 5,000 years of
indigenous wisdom

00:28:22.120 --> 00:28:23.820 align:middle line:90%
have already done that for us.

00:28:23.820 --> 00:28:27.490 align:middle line:84%
In the next episode, we'll
discover those rules, the three

00:28:27.490 --> 00:28:29.710 align:middle line:84%
fundamental laws
of physics, and how

00:28:29.710 --> 00:28:33.954 align:middle line:84%
they make it possible for us
to master our simulated world.

00:28:33.954 --> 00:28:36.370 align:middle line:84%
