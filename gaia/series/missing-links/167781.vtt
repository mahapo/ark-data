00:00:27.070 --> 00:00:28.900 align:middle line:10%
>> Hello, my name's
Gregg Braden,

00:00:28.900 --> 00:00:32.020 align:middle line:10%
and I'd like to welcome you to
this very special presentation

00:00:32.020 --> 00:00:33.580 align:middle line:10%
of "Missing Links".

00:00:33.580 --> 00:00:38.680 align:middle line:84%
Simulation by design, are we
living in a virtual reality?

00:00:38.680 --> 00:00:42.040 align:middle line:84%
In the last episode, we
discovered the simple code

00:00:42.040 --> 00:00:44.290 align:middle line:84%
that governs the
rhythms and the cycles

00:00:44.290 --> 00:00:48.460 align:middle line:84%
of our everyday lives, the
formula for a fractal pattern.

00:00:48.460 --> 00:00:51.790 align:middle line:84%
And while this high-level code
does regulate the beginnings

00:00:51.790 --> 00:00:55.000 align:middle line:84%
and the endings of everything
from love and romance

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:59.040 align:middle line:84%
and relationships and careers
to global patterns of innovation

00:00:59.040 --> 00:01:03.610 align:middle line:84%
and war and peace, it's within
these higher-level patterns

00:01:03.610 --> 00:01:06.970 align:middle line:84%
that we test our
personal limits of power

00:01:06.970 --> 00:01:09.410 align:middle line:84%
to discover what's possible
for us in our simulation

00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:11.200 align:middle line:90%
and what's not.

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:13.900 align:middle line:84%
In this episode, we're going
to go one step further.

00:01:13.900 --> 00:01:16.870 align:middle line:84%
We'll discover the laws
that define those limits

00:01:16.870 --> 00:01:18.835 align:middle line:84%
and how to master
them in our lives.

00:01:18.835 --> 00:01:25.220 align:middle line:90%


00:01:25.220 --> 00:01:27.860 align:middle line:84%
Modern scientists are
pretty much in agreement

00:01:27.860 --> 00:01:29.840 align:middle line:84%
that the universe
as we know it today

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:33.410 align:middle line:84%
began with this tremendous
release of energy, a release

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:35.896 align:middle line:90%
that we call the Big Bang.

00:01:35.896 --> 00:01:37.520 align:middle line:84%
And the reason that
I'm saying that now

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:41.600 align:middle line:84%
is because the idea
of a finite beginning

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:43.730 align:middle line:84%
and of this tremendous
release of energy,

00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:46.600 align:middle line:84%
it coincides beautifully with
the idea of a simulation.

00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:49.790 align:middle line:84%
A simulation has a
definite beginning,

00:01:49.790 --> 00:01:52.670 align:middle line:84%
and a simulation releases
a tremendous amount

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:56.910 align:middle line:84%
of information, or
energy, into the system.

00:01:56.910 --> 00:01:59.570 align:middle line:84%
So if we could go
back to that moment

00:01:59.570 --> 00:02:02.750 align:middle line:84%
when that release of energy
happened, if we could go back

00:02:02.750 --> 00:02:06.785 align:middle line:84%
within just a few fractions of
a second after the Big Bang,

00:02:06.785 --> 00:02:08.360 align:middle line:84%
what would our
universe look like?

00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:10.110 align:middle line:90%
What would we see?

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:13.850 align:middle line:84%
Well, scientists tell us that
immediately after the Big

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:18.740 align:middle line:84%
Bang occurred, the entire
universe as we know it today

00:02:18.740 --> 00:02:23.690 align:middle line:84%
was compressed into an
unimaginably tiny ball

00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:28.150 align:middle line:84%
of energy about the size
of a single green pea.

00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:31.070 align:middle line:84%
So if you can think about
this, if you think about all

00:02:31.070 --> 00:02:35.720 align:middle line:84%
of the physical matter in the
universe as it is today spread

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:39.200 align:middle line:84%
out, expanded, and complex,
and if you could take out

00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:43.730 align:middle line:84%
all of the empty space and
bring all of that matter

00:02:43.730 --> 00:02:49.550 align:middle line:84%
back into contact with
itself, the entire universe,

00:02:49.550 --> 00:02:51.830 align:middle line:84%
all of the matter in
the entire universe

00:02:51.830 --> 00:02:56.390 align:middle line:84%
would occupy the space of
about a single green pea.

00:02:56.390 --> 00:03:00.110 align:middle line:84%
And scientists say that, when
the universe was this size,

00:03:00.110 --> 00:03:02.330 align:middle line:90%
the heat was tremendous.

00:03:02.330 --> 00:03:05.660 align:middle line:84%
They say it was compressed
into a tiny ball

00:03:05.660 --> 00:03:11.420 align:middle line:84%
with temperatures estimated
to be about 18 billion million

00:03:11.420 --> 00:03:14.510 align:middle line:84%
million million
degrees Fahrenheit.

00:03:14.510 --> 00:03:18.680 align:middle line:84%
Then what began to happen
was that the energy began

00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:20.360 align:middle line:90%
to expand.

00:03:20.360 --> 00:03:22.730 align:middle line:84%
And this is the equivalent
of the beginning

00:03:22.730 --> 00:03:24.230 align:middle line:90%
of our simulation.

00:03:24.230 --> 00:03:27.950 align:middle line:84%
As the energy
expands, information

00:03:27.950 --> 00:03:32.810 align:middle line:84%
expands and begins to take
up more and more space.

00:03:32.810 --> 00:03:36.950 align:middle line:84%
The key here is that there was a
point where everything was once

00:03:36.950 --> 00:03:38.515 align:middle line:90%
physically connected.

00:03:38.515 --> 00:03:40.820 align:middle line:90%
And here's why that's important.

00:03:40.820 --> 00:03:43.520 align:middle line:84%
If everything was
once physically

00:03:43.520 --> 00:03:46.640 align:middle line:84%
connected at some
point in the past,

00:03:46.640 --> 00:03:51.470 align:middle line:84%
what does that mean for the
relationship with that energy

00:03:51.470 --> 00:03:54.800 align:middle line:84%
now as it is
dispersed throughout

00:03:54.800 --> 00:03:58.280 align:middle line:84%
this huge, vast expanse
that we call the universe?

00:03:58.280 --> 00:04:01.670 align:middle line:84%
In other words, because
the energy was once

00:04:01.670 --> 00:04:05.210 align:middle line:84%
physically connected, even
though it is no longer,

00:04:05.210 --> 00:04:07.280 align:middle line:90%
is the energy still connected?

00:04:07.280 --> 00:04:09.734 align:middle line:90%
Are we energetically connected?

00:04:09.734 --> 00:04:11.150 align:middle line:84%
Well, there was
an experiment that

00:04:11.150 --> 00:04:14.300 align:middle line:84%
was conducted to answer
precisely this question.

00:04:14.300 --> 00:04:17.170 align:middle line:84%
And I want to share this
experiment with you now.

00:04:17.170 --> 00:04:20.870 align:middle line:84%
It was called the twin
photon experiment.

00:04:20.870 --> 00:04:26.360 align:middle line:84%
It was conducted in 1997,
the University of Geneva.

00:04:26.360 --> 00:04:30.620 align:middle line:84%
It was reported to over
3,400 journalists, educators,

00:04:30.620 --> 00:04:33.680 align:middle line:84%
scientists, and engineers
in more than 40 countries

00:04:33.680 --> 00:04:37.100 align:middle line:84%
on Friday, July
25th of that year.

00:04:37.100 --> 00:04:39.950 align:middle line:84%
So let me share with you
how this experiment worked.

00:04:39.950 --> 00:04:42.170 align:middle line:84%
And we can take the
ideas from the experiment

00:04:42.170 --> 00:04:45.350 align:middle line:84%
itself and apply them to
our lives in the simulation

00:04:45.350 --> 00:04:47.390 align:middle line:90%
that we're living right now.

00:04:47.390 --> 00:04:49.640 align:middle line:10%
So in the experiment,
the scientists

00:04:49.640 --> 00:04:54.250 align:middle line:10%
began with a particle of
energy that forms atoms.

00:04:54.250 --> 00:04:56.210 align:middle line:10%
It's called a photon.

00:04:56.210 --> 00:05:00.380 align:middle line:10%
And they wanted to have
two identical photons,

00:05:00.380 --> 00:05:05.420 align:middle line:10%
so they took one and broke it
into two separate photons that

00:05:05.420 --> 00:05:07.790 align:middle line:10%
have precisely the
same properties.

00:05:07.790 --> 00:05:11.630 align:middle line:84%
They have to because they are
from the same original photon.

00:05:11.630 --> 00:05:15.500 align:middle line:84%
This is why they are
called the twin photons.

00:05:15.500 --> 00:05:19.820 align:middle line:84%
Once they had two
identical photons,

00:05:19.820 --> 00:05:23.030 align:middle line:84%
they placed them into
a specialized device

00:05:23.030 --> 00:05:26.720 align:middle line:84%
that was connected to
fiber optic cables that

00:05:26.720 --> 00:05:29.270 align:middle line:90%
ran in opposite directions.

00:05:29.270 --> 00:05:34.070 align:middle line:84%
From the device, one cable ran
seven miles in one direction.

00:05:34.070 --> 00:05:37.630 align:middle line:84%
One cable ran seven miles
in the other direction.

00:05:37.630 --> 00:05:44.330 align:middle line:84%
And they took these photons and
they fired them simultaneously

00:05:44.330 --> 00:05:49.250 align:middle line:84%
in the two directions so
that when each photon reached

00:05:49.250 --> 00:05:52.160 align:middle line:84%
the maximum distance from
the place where it began,

00:05:52.160 --> 00:05:54.570 align:middle line:90%
they were 14 miles apart.

00:05:54.570 --> 00:05:57.320 align:middle line:84%
But this is where
the experiment began

00:05:57.320 --> 00:06:02.480 align:middle line:84%
because, once those photons
were isolated, 14 miles apart,

00:06:02.480 --> 00:06:08.390 align:middle line:84%
scientists began to demonstrate
that what happened to one

00:06:08.390 --> 00:06:13.090 align:middle line:84%
photon was perceived and was
happening to the other photon

00:06:13.090 --> 00:06:15.600 align:middle line:90%
at exactly the same time.

00:06:15.600 --> 00:06:18.470 align:middle line:84%
So for example, if they would
change the magnetic charge

00:06:18.470 --> 00:06:22.010 align:middle line:84%
on one photon, the magnetic
charge in the other photon

00:06:22.010 --> 00:06:24.975 align:middle line:84%
changed as if it were
having the same experience,

00:06:24.975 --> 00:06:28.200 align:middle line:84%
as if it were the one
that had been tweaked.

00:06:28.200 --> 00:06:31.800 align:middle line:84%
Or if the rotation of one
of the photons was shifted,

00:06:31.800 --> 00:06:33.510 align:middle line:84%
the other one
acted as if it were

00:06:33.510 --> 00:06:36.660 align:middle line:90%
the one that had been changed.

00:06:36.660 --> 00:06:40.140 align:middle line:84%
They were communicating,
and the mystery, the mystery

00:06:40.140 --> 00:06:42.105 align:middle line:90%
was, how are they communicating?

00:06:42.105 --> 00:06:44.130 align:middle line:90%
And here's why it's a mystery.

00:06:44.130 --> 00:06:47.730 align:middle line:84%
Because we're told in
our world of physics

00:06:47.730 --> 00:06:52.200 align:middle line:84%
that information can only travel
as fast as the speed of light

00:06:52.200 --> 00:06:53.480 align:middle line:90%
and no faster.

00:06:53.480 --> 00:06:58.050 align:middle line:10%
All right, so the scientists
were using atomic clocks

00:06:58.050 --> 00:07:03.330 align:middle line:10%
to find out how much time lapsed
between the time one photon

00:07:03.330 --> 00:07:06.446 align:middle line:10%
was tweaked and when the
other photon responded.

00:07:06.446 --> 00:07:08.070 align:middle line:84%
And to their amazement,
what they found

00:07:08.070 --> 00:07:11.100 align:middle line:84%
is the amount of time
that lapsed was zero.

00:07:11.100 --> 00:07:13.230 align:middle line:90%
There was no time lapse.

00:07:13.230 --> 00:07:15.570 align:middle line:90%
The change was instantaneous.

00:07:15.570 --> 00:07:17.160 align:middle line:84%
And they said, well,
how can that be?

00:07:17.160 --> 00:07:21.090 align:middle line:84%
Because the information must
get from one to the other.

00:07:21.090 --> 00:07:23.130 align:middle line:84%
It cannot travel faster
than the speed of light.

00:07:23.130 --> 00:07:25.680 align:middle line:90%
How can this be simultaneous?

00:07:25.680 --> 00:07:28.052 align:middle line:84%
And this led them
to the understanding

00:07:28.052 --> 00:07:30.510 align:middle line:84%
that is relevant for everything
that we're doing here right

00:07:30.510 --> 00:07:32.850 align:middle line:90%
now in our simulation.

00:07:32.850 --> 00:07:37.320 align:middle line:84%
The photons did not need to
communicate from one place

00:07:37.320 --> 00:07:39.300 align:middle line:84%
to another, as
conventional thinking says.

00:07:39.300 --> 00:07:41.540 align:middle line:90%
It's a linear way of thinking.

00:07:41.540 --> 00:07:43.990 align:middle line:84%
They weren't
communicating, saying,

00:07:43.990 --> 00:07:46.620 align:middle line:84%
hey, I just had my
charge changed over here,

00:07:46.620 --> 00:07:49.080 align:middle line:84%
and now you need to
change yours over there.

00:07:49.080 --> 00:07:54.810 align:middle line:84%
What happened was, even though
they were physically separated,

00:07:54.810 --> 00:07:58.740 align:middle line:84%
because they had
once been combined,

00:07:58.740 --> 00:08:02.345 align:middle line:84%
they were still connected
on an energetic level.

00:08:02.345 --> 00:08:05.250 align:middle line:84%
And this is what the
experiment is showing.

00:08:05.250 --> 00:08:07.800 align:middle line:84%
It is called entanglement,
this relationship

00:08:07.800 --> 00:08:10.500 align:middle line:90%
is called quantum entanglement.

00:08:10.500 --> 00:08:13.830 align:middle line:84%
And what it says to
us is that matter,

00:08:13.830 --> 00:08:18.660 align:middle line:84%
once it is physically
connected, remains energetically

00:08:18.660 --> 00:08:23.850 align:middle line:84%
connected, even when the space
that separates the matter

00:08:23.850 --> 00:08:24.990 align:middle line:90%
is of great distance.

00:08:24.990 --> 00:08:27.250 align:middle line:84%
In this case, it was
measured in miles.

00:08:27.250 --> 00:08:32.100 align:middle line:84%
So now, scientists took this
understanding, this discovery,

00:08:32.100 --> 00:08:35.400 align:middle line:84%
and they began to
look into the universe

00:08:35.400 --> 00:08:38.970 align:middle line:84%
and see where else this
entanglement might apply.

00:08:38.970 --> 00:08:41.250 align:middle line:84%
And what they found is
that, not only does it

00:08:41.250 --> 00:08:47.520 align:middle line:84%
apply on distances as small
as 14 miles, what they found

00:08:47.520 --> 00:08:51.510 align:middle line:84%
is that galaxies on one
side of the universe

00:08:51.510 --> 00:08:54.450 align:middle line:84%
are actually entangled
with galaxies

00:08:54.450 --> 00:08:58.619 align:middle line:84%
on the other side of the
universe, light years distant.

00:08:58.619 --> 00:08:59.910 align:middle line:90%
And they said, how can this be?

00:08:59.910 --> 00:09:01.980 align:middle line:90%
How can this be possible?

00:09:01.980 --> 00:09:03.900 align:middle line:84%
Well, you already
know the answer

00:09:03.900 --> 00:09:06.090 align:middle line:84%
because we've shared
this in this program

00:09:06.090 --> 00:09:09.210 align:middle line:84%
and we also talked about this
in the first season of "Missing

00:09:09.210 --> 00:09:11.580 align:middle line:90%
Links" in greater detail.

00:09:11.580 --> 00:09:13.400 align:middle line:90%
What we're now seeing is this.

00:09:13.400 --> 00:09:15.240 align:middle line:84%
And this is why I took
a little bit of time

00:09:15.240 --> 00:09:17.490 align:middle line:90%
to talk about the Big Bang.

00:09:17.490 --> 00:09:21.120 align:middle line:84%
In the beginning, all
of the physical matter

00:09:21.120 --> 00:09:23.880 align:middle line:84%
in our universe, in
our known universe,

00:09:23.880 --> 00:09:28.350 align:middle line:84%
it was condensed into the
size of that single green pea.

00:09:28.350 --> 00:09:30.060 align:middle line:90%
It was connected.

00:09:30.060 --> 00:09:34.020 align:middle line:84%
And as the energy
began to expand

00:09:34.020 --> 00:09:36.960 align:middle line:84%
and the matter itself
became separate

00:09:36.960 --> 00:09:40.170 align:middle line:84%
from other particles of
matter physically, what

00:09:40.170 --> 00:09:42.900 align:middle line:84%
the experiment is showing
is that that matter is still

00:09:42.900 --> 00:09:45.100 align:middle line:90%
connected energetically.

00:09:45.100 --> 00:09:47.675 align:middle line:84%
So when we talk
about a connection

00:09:47.675 --> 00:09:49.800 align:middle line:84%
in our lives, when we talk
about us being connected

00:09:49.800 --> 00:09:52.410 align:middle line:84%
to other people, and we talk
about us being connected

00:09:52.410 --> 00:09:55.470 align:middle line:84%
to trees, to plants,
to insects, to animals,

00:09:55.470 --> 00:09:58.410 align:middle line:90%
we connect to other worlds.

00:09:58.410 --> 00:10:00.870 align:middle line:84%
Is there a scientific
basis for that connection?

00:10:00.870 --> 00:10:06.570 align:middle line:84%
Absolutely, physical matter
once physically connected

00:10:06.570 --> 00:10:08.865 align:middle line:84%
remains energetically
connected, even when

00:10:08.865 --> 00:10:12.540 align:middle line:84%
it is separated by
tremendous distances.

00:10:12.540 --> 00:10:15.090 align:middle line:10%
So this relationship
of entanglement

00:10:15.090 --> 00:10:18.720 align:middle line:10%
holds the key to
understanding our relationship

00:10:18.720 --> 00:10:21.270 align:middle line:10%
to our virtual world,
to our simulation.

00:10:21.270 --> 00:10:22.810 align:middle line:90%
There is a field of energy.

00:10:22.810 --> 00:10:27.150 align:middle line:84%
It connects all things
everywhere, and it connects us.

00:10:27.150 --> 00:10:28.670 align:middle line:90%
We are part of the field.

00:10:28.670 --> 00:10:31.100 align:middle line:84%
We are not separate
from that field.

00:10:31.100 --> 00:10:34.530 align:middle line:84%
So if we're going to
master our simulation,

00:10:34.530 --> 00:10:38.400 align:middle line:84%
we've got to master the
rules, the laws that

00:10:38.400 --> 00:10:41.910 align:middle line:84%
govern entangled
information in this field.

00:10:41.910 --> 00:10:44.700 align:middle line:84%
And in the modern world,
we know those laws

00:10:44.700 --> 00:10:47.961 align:middle line:90%
as the laws of modern physics.

00:10:47.961 --> 00:10:50.910 align:middle line:84%
So to be very clear, I'm going
to make a distinction here

00:10:50.910 --> 00:10:53.610 align:middle line:84%
between the fundamental
laws of physics

00:10:53.610 --> 00:10:58.225 align:middle line:84%
and what we know as constants
that operate within those laws.

00:10:58.225 --> 00:11:00.100 align:middle line:84%
So I know you're all
familiar with constants,

00:11:00.100 --> 00:11:02.058 align:middle line:84%
the speed of light, for
example, is a constant.

00:11:02.058 --> 00:11:05.390 align:middle line:84%
The speed of sound,
the magnetic field,

00:11:05.390 --> 00:11:07.890 align:middle line:84%
Coulomb's law,
Avogadro's number,

00:11:07.890 --> 00:11:14.130 align:middle line:84%
atomic mass, these are examples
of constants that operate

00:11:14.130 --> 00:11:16.634 align:middle line:90%
within the laws of the field.

00:11:16.634 --> 00:11:18.300 align:middle line:84%
And while those
constants are important,

00:11:18.300 --> 00:11:19.920 align:middle line:84%
what I'm really
interested in here

00:11:19.920 --> 00:11:22.860 align:middle line:84%
are the laws themselves
because those laws

00:11:22.860 --> 00:11:24.130 align:middle line:90%
apply to you and to me.

00:11:24.130 --> 00:11:26.460 align:middle line:90%
They apply to our lives.

00:11:26.460 --> 00:11:28.260 align:middle line:90%
They apply to our emotions.

00:11:28.260 --> 00:11:30.440 align:middle line:90%
They apply to our relationships.

00:11:30.440 --> 00:11:33.000 align:middle line:84%
They apply to the healing
of our bodies because--

00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:35.050 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to invite
you now to think back--

00:11:35.050 --> 00:11:37.140 align:middle line:90%
we are energy.

00:11:37.140 --> 00:11:39.180 align:middle line:90%
And energy is information.

00:11:39.180 --> 00:11:42.090 align:middle line:84%
This information is being
constantly cranked out

00:11:42.090 --> 00:11:44.100 align:middle line:90%
through this fractal pattern.

00:11:44.100 --> 00:11:48.030 align:middle line:84%
So as we change the way
that we think and feel,

00:11:48.030 --> 00:11:50.070 align:middle line:84%
what we're doing
is we're actually

00:11:50.070 --> 00:11:51.510 align:middle line:90%
tweaking the mathematics.

00:11:51.510 --> 00:11:54.570 align:middle line:84%
We're tweaking that code
that cranks the information.

00:11:54.570 --> 00:11:57.270 align:middle line:84%
And this is how we learn about
ourselves and our relationship

00:11:57.270 --> 00:11:58.562 align:middle line:90%
to the simulation.

00:11:58.562 --> 00:12:00.270 align:middle line:84%
This is going to be
important as we begin

00:12:00.270 --> 00:12:02.379 align:middle line:90%
to answer the big questions.

00:12:02.379 --> 00:12:03.670 align:middle line:90%
Why do we have this simulation?

00:12:03.670 --> 00:12:05.700 align:middle line:90%
And what are we learning?

00:12:05.700 --> 00:12:07.620 align:middle line:90%
What are we benefiting from?

00:12:07.620 --> 00:12:09.555 align:middle line:84%
And how can we make
our lives better?

00:12:09.555 --> 00:12:11.790 align:middle line:90%
How can we make a better world?

00:12:11.790 --> 00:12:14.070 align:middle line:84%
And ultimately, where's
this world leading?

00:12:14.070 --> 00:12:16.800 align:middle line:84%
All of these questions,
we can only answer them

00:12:16.800 --> 00:12:20.430 align:middle line:84%
when we have a firm
understanding of these rules

00:12:20.430 --> 00:12:23.610 align:middle line:84%
and the laws that govern the
energy that we're immersed in,

00:12:23.610 --> 00:12:25.520 align:middle line:90%
the energy of our experience.

00:12:25.520 --> 00:12:31.360 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:12:31.360 --> 00:12:36.610 align:middle line:10%
So in 1686, Sir Isaac
Newton, the mathematician,

00:12:36.610 --> 00:12:42.380 align:middle line:10%
he formalized the laws of
energy as the modern-day laws

00:12:42.380 --> 00:12:45.620 align:middle line:10%
of physics, what we know as
the laws of physics today.

00:12:45.620 --> 00:12:48.230 align:middle line:84%
But what Newton
probably didn't know

00:12:48.230 --> 00:12:50.870 align:middle line:84%
is that, when he
formalized those laws,

00:12:50.870 --> 00:12:55.030 align:middle line:84%
he formalized the description of
how energy moves in our world.

00:12:55.030 --> 00:12:58.490 align:middle line:84%
And without even knowing it,
he was identifying the rules

00:12:58.490 --> 00:13:00.560 align:middle line:84%
of the simulation
that he was living

00:13:00.560 --> 00:13:02.280 align:middle line:84%
and that we are
living right now,

00:13:02.280 --> 00:13:05.086 align:middle line:84%
the boundaries of what
it is and what it is not,

00:13:05.086 --> 00:13:06.710 align:middle line:84%
what's possible in
our lives and what's

00:13:06.710 --> 00:13:08.630 align:middle line:90%
not possible in our lives.

00:13:08.630 --> 00:13:12.650 align:middle line:10%
And he was also showing
us what it takes to master

00:13:12.650 --> 00:13:17.000 align:middle line:10%
and even transcend those laws to
free ourselves from the limits

00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:19.410 align:middle line:10%
that they impose in our lives.

00:13:19.410 --> 00:13:22.040 align:middle line:84%
So what are Newton's
laws for the way

00:13:22.040 --> 00:13:24.785 align:middle line:84%
that energy moves
in our simulation?

00:13:24.785 --> 00:13:27.230 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to share
three fundamental laws.

00:13:27.230 --> 00:13:32.450 align:middle line:84%
There are others, but the three
fundamental laws of motion

00:13:32.450 --> 00:13:34.400 align:middle line:84%
I'm choosing to share
with you now because it

00:13:34.400 --> 00:13:40.140 align:middle line:84%
is the motion of that energy
in our lives in our simulation

00:13:40.140 --> 00:13:44.670 align:middle line:84%
that we are directing through
the biology of our bodies.

00:13:44.670 --> 00:13:46.640 align:middle line:10%
Remember, what we
found was that,

00:13:46.640 --> 00:13:49.910 align:middle line:10%
when we shift our thoughts,
feelings, emotions,

00:13:49.910 --> 00:13:53.170 align:middle line:10%
and beliefs, we're changing
the biology of our body.

00:13:53.170 --> 00:13:55.700 align:middle line:84%
We're changing the way the
nerves are interacting.

00:13:55.700 --> 00:13:58.580 align:middle line:84%
We're changing the way
neurons are hooking up.

00:13:58.580 --> 00:14:01.870 align:middle line:84%
And when we do that, it shifts
the chemistry within us,

00:14:01.870 --> 00:14:04.310 align:middle line:84%
and that chemistry
influences the world

00:14:04.310 --> 00:14:06.530 align:middle line:90%
beyond our physical bodies.

00:14:06.530 --> 00:14:11.120 align:middle line:84%
So we are actually
interacting with the program.

00:14:11.120 --> 00:14:14.450 align:middle line:84%
We are interacting
with the fractal code

00:14:14.450 --> 00:14:17.480 align:middle line:84%
constantly, every moment,
every day of our lives.

00:14:17.480 --> 00:14:19.200 align:middle line:84%
I'm not saying that
we do it consciously

00:14:19.200 --> 00:14:21.590 align:middle line:84%
or that we know
what we're doing,

00:14:21.590 --> 00:14:24.350 align:middle line:84%
but what we are
actually doing is

00:14:24.350 --> 00:14:28.580 align:middle line:84%
we are tweaking this fundamental
mathematic code to change

00:14:28.580 --> 00:14:30.680 align:middle line:84%
the conditions of
the simulation,

00:14:30.680 --> 00:14:34.760 align:middle line:84%
reflecting the changes that
we've made within our lives.

00:14:34.760 --> 00:14:36.230 align:middle line:84%
So for that reason,
we're talking

00:14:36.230 --> 00:14:38.370 align:middle line:90%
about energy and motion.

00:14:38.370 --> 00:14:42.030 align:middle line:84%
And it makes sense to talk
about Newton's laws of motion.

00:14:42.030 --> 00:14:43.970 align:middle line:90%
So what are those laws?

00:14:43.970 --> 00:14:47.100 align:middle line:84%
Well, the first law of motion
is a very familiar one.

00:14:47.100 --> 00:14:48.830 align:middle line:84%
And I'm sure you've
heard of this before.

00:14:48.830 --> 00:14:52.705 align:middle line:84%
And I want to read it to
you as a direct quote.

00:14:52.705 --> 00:14:56.750 align:middle line:84%
What Newton says is
that, "A body at rest

00:14:56.750 --> 00:14:59.975 align:middle line:84%
will remain at rest,
and a body in motion

00:14:59.975 --> 00:15:03.290 align:middle line:84%
will remain in motion
unless it is acted

00:15:03.290 --> 00:15:05.795 align:middle line:90%
upon by an external force."

00:15:05.795 --> 00:15:07.719 align:middle line:90%
OK, that's his words.

00:15:07.719 --> 00:15:08.760 align:middle line:90%
So what is he telling us?

00:15:08.760 --> 00:15:11.150 align:middle line:84%
Well, he's telling us what
you probably already know.

00:15:11.150 --> 00:15:14.570 align:middle line:84%
In our simulation, the
energy of our life,

00:15:14.570 --> 00:15:17.125 align:middle line:84%
our relationships, the
state of our health,

00:15:17.125 --> 00:15:22.525 align:middle line:84%
it remains constant until
we initiate a change.

00:15:22.525 --> 00:15:25.140 align:middle line:84%
In other words, we are
all on a trajectory.

00:15:25.140 --> 00:15:26.840 align:middle line:90%
We are all on a course.

00:15:26.840 --> 00:15:29.554 align:middle line:84%
And unless something
shifts within us,

00:15:29.554 --> 00:15:31.220 align:middle line:84%
that course is going
to remain the same.

00:15:31.220 --> 00:15:33.680 align:middle line:84%
When we talked about
this in the last episode

00:15:33.680 --> 00:15:36.080 align:middle line:84%
with the fractal
patterns, we can

00:15:36.080 --> 00:15:38.540 align:middle line:90%
have a pattern in our lives.

00:15:38.540 --> 00:15:42.320 align:middle line:84%
And we think that we
don't like that pattern,

00:15:42.320 --> 00:15:44.240 align:middle line:90%
so we change our relationship.

00:15:44.240 --> 00:15:45.290 align:middle line:90%
We change our job.

00:15:45.290 --> 00:15:46.220 align:middle line:90%
We change our career.

00:15:46.220 --> 00:15:48.560 align:middle line:84%
We change the city
where we live.

00:15:48.560 --> 00:15:51.410 align:middle line:10%
And we find out that the
same pattern shows up again

00:15:51.410 --> 00:15:52.940 align:middle line:10%
and again and again.

00:15:52.940 --> 00:15:57.710 align:middle line:10%
If that's true, it's because
of this law of motion.

00:15:57.710 --> 00:16:01.970 align:middle line:84%
We have to change
the energy itself

00:16:01.970 --> 00:16:04.370 align:middle line:84%
before we're going
to see a change

00:16:04.370 --> 00:16:06.830 align:middle line:90%
in those patterns of our lives.

00:16:06.830 --> 00:16:11.000 align:middle line:84%
So it is our choice,
within this simulation,

00:16:11.000 --> 00:16:16.280 align:middle line:84%
that empowers us to make use of
Newton's first law of motion.

00:16:16.280 --> 00:16:18.270 align:middle line:84%
"A body at rest
remains at rest."

00:16:18.270 --> 00:16:19.730 align:middle line:84%
Whatever is happening
in your life

00:16:19.730 --> 00:16:21.770 align:middle line:84%
right now, think
about your life.

00:16:21.770 --> 00:16:23.560 align:middle line:90%
Think about your relationships.

00:16:23.560 --> 00:16:26.915 align:middle line:84%
Think about your body,
your health, your career,

00:16:26.915 --> 00:16:29.214 align:middle line:84%
the abundance in your
world, your friends,

00:16:29.214 --> 00:16:30.380 align:middle line:90%
your family, where you live.

00:16:30.380 --> 00:16:34.310 align:middle line:84%
All of those things, they
are energy in motion.

00:16:34.310 --> 00:16:36.360 align:middle line:84%
And that motion is
on a trajectory.

00:16:36.360 --> 00:16:40.160 align:middle line:84%
All right, if you do nothing,
what this law suggests

00:16:40.160 --> 00:16:44.630 align:middle line:84%
is that, within this simulation,
those patterns are pretty much

00:16:44.630 --> 00:16:46.430 align:middle line:90%
going to remain constant.

00:16:46.430 --> 00:16:49.010 align:middle line:84%
And if you're happy with those
patterns, it's a good thing.

00:16:49.010 --> 00:16:52.390 align:middle line:84%
If you're not happy, this law,
this very, very simple law--

00:16:52.390 --> 00:16:53.760 align:middle line:90%
it's deceptively simple.

00:16:53.760 --> 00:16:56.880 align:middle line:84%
Please do not be deceived by
the simplicity of this law.

00:16:56.880 --> 00:16:59.480 align:middle line:90%
Newton had to understand this.

00:16:59.480 --> 00:17:04.190 align:middle line:84%
He had to formalize what
we all knew at that time,

00:17:04.190 --> 00:17:06.589 align:middle line:84%
and what we now know, is
happening in our lives.

00:17:06.589 --> 00:17:08.090 align:middle line:90%
He had to formalize these laws.

00:17:08.090 --> 00:17:09.859 align:middle line:84%
And before he
could even do that,

00:17:09.859 --> 00:17:13.430 align:middle line:84%
he had to develop the
mathematics, the calculus,

00:17:13.430 --> 00:17:15.990 align:middle line:84%
that would allow him to
formalize these laws.

00:17:15.990 --> 00:17:18.770 align:middle line:84%
So he made our jobs
very, very easy.

00:17:18.770 --> 00:17:22.640 align:middle line:84%
Newton simply formalized
in mathematics

00:17:22.640 --> 00:17:25.585 align:middle line:84%
what we see happening
in the world around us.

00:17:25.585 --> 00:17:28.220 align:middle line:84%
So please don't be
deceived by the simplicity

00:17:28.220 --> 00:17:29.690 align:middle line:90%
of Newton's law of motion.

00:17:29.690 --> 00:17:31.370 align:middle line:90%
It is a very, very powerful law.

00:17:31.370 --> 00:17:33.200 align:middle line:90%
And it's just the first one.

00:17:33.200 --> 00:17:35.600 align:middle line:84%
Newton's second
law of motion says

00:17:35.600 --> 00:17:38.570 align:middle line:84%
that, "The force
acting upon an object

00:17:38.570 --> 00:17:42.950 align:middle line:84%
is equal to the mass of that
object times its acceleration."

00:17:42.950 --> 00:17:45.280 align:middle line:84%
I know it sounds maybe
a little complex.

00:17:45.280 --> 00:17:46.640 align:middle line:90%
Let me say it again.

00:17:46.640 --> 00:17:49.580 align:middle line:84%
He says that, "The force
acting upon an object

00:17:49.580 --> 00:17:54.140 align:middle line:84%
is equal to the mass of that
object times its acceleration."

00:17:54.140 --> 00:17:57.210 align:middle line:84%
What he's really
saying is simply this,

00:17:57.210 --> 00:17:58.970 align:middle line:84%
that the bigger the
energy is that we

00:17:58.970 --> 00:18:03.140 align:middle line:84%
want to change and the faster
that that change is occurring,

00:18:03.140 --> 00:18:06.090 align:middle line:84%
the more force it's going to
take to change that energy.

00:18:06.090 --> 00:18:08.420 align:middle line:84%
All right, but you
already know that as well.

00:18:08.420 --> 00:18:12.590 align:middle line:84%
Think about this in
terms of your own body.

00:18:12.590 --> 00:18:16.020 align:middle line:84%
If you are looking for
a healing in your body,

00:18:16.020 --> 00:18:20.240 align:middle line:84%
for example, if your body
has an infection, all right,

00:18:20.240 --> 00:18:22.730 align:middle line:84%
if it is a big
infection, then you're

00:18:22.730 --> 00:18:26.300 align:middle line:84%
going to need something
more than a small dose

00:18:26.300 --> 00:18:29.720 align:middle line:84%
of an herb or an
antibiotic typically

00:18:29.720 --> 00:18:32.600 align:middle line:84%
to deal with that infection
because the infection is

00:18:32.600 --> 00:18:34.040 align:middle line:90%
a pattern of energy.

00:18:34.040 --> 00:18:36.110 align:middle line:90%
It is already in motion.

00:18:36.110 --> 00:18:40.190 align:middle line:84%
That energy is moving
somewhere, and the bigger

00:18:40.190 --> 00:18:42.920 align:middle line:84%
the energy, the bigger the
infection, the more energy

00:18:42.920 --> 00:18:45.210 align:middle line:84%
it's going to take
to make that shift.

00:18:45.210 --> 00:18:47.210 align:middle line:84%
All right, so this is
what Newton is telling us.

00:18:47.210 --> 00:18:50.180 align:middle line:84%
The bigger the energy is
that we want to change

00:18:50.180 --> 00:18:53.120 align:middle line:84%
and the faster that change
is already occurring,

00:18:53.120 --> 00:18:55.520 align:middle line:84%
the more force it's
going to take to change

00:18:55.520 --> 00:18:57.770 align:middle line:90%
that energy in our lives.

00:18:57.770 --> 00:19:02.460 align:middle line:10%
Newton's third law of motion
is probably the best known,

00:19:02.460 --> 00:19:04.370 align:middle line:10%
and it simply says,
"For every action,

00:19:04.370 --> 00:19:07.640 align:middle line:10%
there is an equal and
opposite reaction."

00:19:07.640 --> 00:19:10.495 align:middle line:10%
Well, our mothers taught
us this in everyday life.

00:19:10.495 --> 00:19:13.430 align:middle line:10%
We know it as what we
call the golden rule.

00:19:13.430 --> 00:19:17.030 align:middle line:84%
Do unto others as we would
want them to do unto us.

00:19:17.030 --> 00:19:19.610 align:middle line:84%
And what this is
telling us, it simply

00:19:19.610 --> 00:19:22.820 align:middle line:84%
implies that what we put
out and how strongly we

00:19:22.820 --> 00:19:25.790 align:middle line:84%
put it out is what comes
back to us, the opposite

00:19:25.790 --> 00:19:27.940 align:middle line:90%
and the equal reaction.

00:19:27.940 --> 00:19:30.710 align:middle line:84%
All right, so this is
important in our lives

00:19:30.710 --> 00:19:33.670 align:middle line:84%
because, if we want
to create change,

00:19:33.670 --> 00:19:35.930 align:middle line:84%
we've got to do more than
simply think about it.

00:19:35.930 --> 00:19:37.170 align:middle line:90%
You know that.

00:19:37.170 --> 00:19:39.335 align:middle line:84%
The thinking is where
the change begins,

00:19:39.335 --> 00:19:43.640 align:middle line:84%
but we've got to
take that thinking

00:19:43.640 --> 00:19:48.200 align:middle line:84%
and create the energy that
reflects that thinking

00:19:48.200 --> 00:19:52.280 align:middle line:84%
to shift the patterns of
information in our simulation.

00:19:52.280 --> 00:19:55.250 align:middle line:84%
All right, now, these laws, they
may seem very obvious to us,

00:19:55.250 --> 00:19:56.990 align:middle line:84%
but what Newton
did was he actually

00:19:56.990 --> 00:20:00.260 align:middle line:84%
formalized the physical
laws, once again,

00:20:00.260 --> 00:20:03.830 align:middle line:84%
of how the energy in this
simulation is working.

00:20:03.830 --> 00:20:06.360 align:middle line:84%
And you think back to
the fractal formula,

00:20:06.360 --> 00:20:09.710 align:middle line:84%
the formula that governs
all patterns of energy,

00:20:09.710 --> 00:20:10.970 align:middle line:90%
self-replicating.

00:20:10.970 --> 00:20:13.570 align:middle line:84%
It's putting us out again
and again and again.

00:20:13.570 --> 00:20:16.970 align:middle line:84%
When we make a change in
our lives, what we're doing

00:20:16.970 --> 00:20:21.530 align:middle line:84%
is we're changing the variable
that is in that formula.

00:20:21.530 --> 00:20:26.450 align:middle line:84%
We are changing what
the c is in the formula

00:20:26.450 --> 00:20:29.900 align:middle line:84%
so that we can now
create a new output

00:20:29.900 --> 00:20:31.760 align:middle line:84%
and feed it back
into the formula,

00:20:31.760 --> 00:20:34.599 align:middle line:84%
reflecting that
change in our lives.

00:20:34.599 --> 00:20:36.890 align:middle line:84%
So this is the beauty-- it's
a very, very different way

00:20:36.890 --> 00:20:38.090 align:middle line:90%
of thinking.

00:20:38.090 --> 00:20:41.080 align:middle line:84%
You know, we think
about the natural world,

00:20:41.080 --> 00:20:44.930 align:middle line:84%
and we're conditioned to
think that everything happened

00:20:44.930 --> 00:20:46.970 align:middle line:90%
as a result of a natural force.

00:20:46.970 --> 00:20:48.890 align:middle line:90%
So the Big Bang happened.

00:20:48.890 --> 00:20:52.010 align:middle line:84%
Nobody really knows
exactly why it happened

00:20:52.010 --> 00:20:56.105 align:middle line:84%
and that we are the product
of mechanical patterns

00:20:56.105 --> 00:20:57.210 align:middle line:90%
of information.

00:20:57.210 --> 00:21:00.050 align:middle line:84%
This is a mechanical way
of thinking of the world

00:21:00.050 --> 00:21:04.100 align:middle line:84%
and that that pattern simply
continues forever, all right,

00:21:04.100 --> 00:21:07.970 align:middle line:84%
but what this is now telling us,
when we think of a simulation,

00:21:07.970 --> 00:21:09.770 align:middle line:90%
this is the shift.

00:21:09.770 --> 00:21:13.640 align:middle line:84%
We're thinking of a
program that began

00:21:13.640 --> 00:21:16.250 align:middle line:84%
and us being part
of that program.

00:21:16.250 --> 00:21:18.780 align:middle line:84%
The energy of our lives,
the energy of our thoughts,

00:21:18.780 --> 00:21:22.250 align:middle line:84%
feelings, emotions, and
beliefs actually interacting

00:21:22.250 --> 00:21:26.270 align:middle line:84%
with the mathematic code
with a fractal formula that

00:21:26.270 --> 00:21:30.080 align:middle line:84%
is cranking out the information,
perpetuating the patterns.

00:21:30.080 --> 00:21:33.080 align:middle line:84%
So in a very real sense,
we are all programmers.

00:21:33.080 --> 00:21:37.100 align:middle line:84%
And what we call
consciousness is the energy

00:21:37.100 --> 00:21:39.890 align:middle line:84%
that connects us
with the simulation

00:21:39.890 --> 00:21:42.660 align:middle line:90%
and with the world around us.

00:21:42.660 --> 00:21:46.850 align:middle line:84%
And as we shift our thoughts,
feelings, emotions, beliefs,

00:21:46.850 --> 00:21:49.910 align:middle line:84%
we are reprogramming
that fractal code

00:21:49.910 --> 00:21:52.850 align:middle line:84%
so that the energy
around us reflects

00:21:52.850 --> 00:21:55.320 align:middle line:90%
those beliefs and our lives.

00:21:55.320 --> 00:21:58.400 align:middle line:84%
And this is the basis,
precisely the basis,

00:21:58.400 --> 00:22:00.980 align:middle line:84%
for what many ancient
traditions tried to tell us.

00:22:00.980 --> 00:22:02.800 align:middle line:90%
And think about this.

00:22:02.800 --> 00:22:06.520 align:middle line:84%
You and I are having
this conversation.

00:22:06.520 --> 00:22:08.270 align:middle line:84%
Maybe you're having a
conversation with me

00:22:08.270 --> 00:22:09.070 align:middle line:90%
in your mind.

00:22:09.070 --> 00:22:10.800 align:middle line:84%
I'm speaking to you
directly right now.

00:22:10.800 --> 00:22:12.390 align:middle line:90%
We are interacting.

00:22:12.390 --> 00:22:17.210 align:middle line:84%
OK, and we're describing
this very complex idea

00:22:17.210 --> 00:22:19.610 align:middle line:84%
through contemporary
language, through the language

00:22:19.610 --> 00:22:21.443 align:middle line:84%
of science, through the
language of physics,

00:22:21.443 --> 00:22:23.529 align:middle line:84%
language of mathematics,
computer science.

00:22:23.529 --> 00:22:25.445 align:middle line:84%
But what we know to be
true today-- and let me

00:22:25.445 --> 00:22:26.805 align:middle line:90%
ask you a question.

00:22:26.805 --> 00:22:29.470 align:middle line:84%
If you understood
everything that we're

00:22:29.470 --> 00:22:32.620 align:middle line:84%
talking about right
now but you went back

00:22:32.620 --> 00:22:39.530 align:middle line:84%
in time 2,500 years ago, 3,000
years ago, 5,000 years ago,

00:22:39.530 --> 00:22:43.070 align:middle line:84%
and you wanted to convey
these ideas to the people

00:22:43.070 --> 00:22:46.340 align:middle line:84%
of your time in a
contemporary language,

00:22:46.340 --> 00:22:48.140 align:middle line:90%
how would you do that?

00:22:48.140 --> 00:22:49.930 align:middle line:90%
What language would you use?

00:22:49.930 --> 00:22:52.990 align:middle line:84%
Well, the answer to
that is the basis,

00:22:52.990 --> 00:22:55.460 align:middle line:84%
it's the core of
our most cherished

00:22:55.460 --> 00:22:58.100 align:middle line:84%
and ancient
spiritual traditions.

00:22:58.100 --> 00:22:59.810 align:middle line:84%
Now, I'm going to make
a distinction here

00:22:59.810 --> 00:23:02.420 align:middle line:84%
between spirituality
and religion.

00:23:02.420 --> 00:23:05.540 align:middle line:84%
The spiritual
traditions are about us,

00:23:05.540 --> 00:23:08.585 align:middle line:84%
our relationships, OK, our
relationship to our bodies,

00:23:08.585 --> 00:23:11.210 align:middle line:84%
our relationship to one another,
our relationship to the earth,

00:23:11.210 --> 00:23:14.270 align:middle line:84%
our relationship to the past,
to the future, to the cosmos,

00:23:14.270 --> 00:23:15.870 align:middle line:90%
to God.

00:23:15.870 --> 00:23:20.150 align:middle line:84%
OK, spirituality tells us
about our relationships.

00:23:20.150 --> 00:23:23.540 align:middle line:84%
Religions came along
at a later time.

00:23:23.540 --> 00:23:25.910 align:middle line:90%
Spirituality was there first.

00:23:25.910 --> 00:23:28.670 align:middle line:84%
The religions came
along later, and they

00:23:28.670 --> 00:23:33.470 align:middle line:84%
wrapped the rules and the
dogma around these fundamental

00:23:33.470 --> 00:23:35.450 align:middle line:90%
spiritual principles.

00:23:35.450 --> 00:23:39.710 align:middle line:84%
And the result was
that, in many cases,

00:23:39.710 --> 00:23:43.310 align:middle line:84%
we began to feel separate from
ourselves, from one another,

00:23:43.310 --> 00:23:46.490 align:middle line:84%
from the earth, from the past,
the future, the cosmos, and God

00:23:46.490 --> 00:23:49.490 align:middle line:84%
because the rules
created that separation.

00:23:49.490 --> 00:23:51.740 align:middle line:84%
So I'm making this distinction
between spirituality

00:23:51.740 --> 00:23:54.035 align:middle line:84%
and religion because
the spiritual traditions

00:23:54.035 --> 00:23:57.110 align:middle line:84%
of the past, for
example, Hindu traditions

00:23:57.110 --> 00:24:00.580 align:middle line:84%
talk about what we call
karma, the laws of karma.

00:24:00.580 --> 00:24:03.860 align:middle line:84%
Well, laws of
karma are us living

00:24:03.860 --> 00:24:07.550 align:middle line:84%
Newton's laws of
energy and motion

00:24:07.550 --> 00:24:12.440 align:middle line:84%
and the consequences, the
energetic consequences,

00:24:12.440 --> 00:24:15.230 align:middle line:84%
of the choices that we
make at one point in time

00:24:15.230 --> 00:24:18.320 align:middle line:84%
and how those choices
must be balanced out.

00:24:18.320 --> 00:24:21.470 align:middle line:84%
We're talking about energy and
information, mathematic codes.

00:24:21.470 --> 00:24:25.260 align:middle line:84%
They must balance out just like
you balance out an equation.

00:24:25.260 --> 00:24:27.740 align:middle line:84%
So you can think of
our karma and what

00:24:27.740 --> 00:24:31.740 align:middle line:84%
we call life circumstances
as part of that big equation.

00:24:31.740 --> 00:24:34.130 align:middle line:84%
And when we find
ourselves in need

00:24:34.130 --> 00:24:37.310 align:middle line:84%
to balance something that
has happened in our lives,

00:24:37.310 --> 00:24:40.830 align:middle line:84%
you can think of it as balancing
the other side of the equation.

00:24:40.830 --> 00:24:42.830 align:middle line:84%
Here's the key, in
the old days, we

00:24:42.830 --> 00:24:45.060 align:middle line:84%
used to think we have to
balance it through lifetime

00:24:45.060 --> 00:24:45.860 align:middle line:90%
after lifetime.

00:24:45.860 --> 00:24:47.960 align:middle line:84%
But if you understand
this process,

00:24:47.960 --> 00:24:51.620 align:middle line:84%
you can balance that karma in
a heartbeat, in a heartbeat,

00:24:51.620 --> 00:24:54.785 align:middle line:84%
because you understand your
relationship to the simulation.

00:24:54.785 --> 00:24:56.960 align:middle line:84%
And you understand
your relationship

00:24:56.960 --> 00:24:59.000 align:middle line:90%
to those laws of physics.

00:24:59.000 --> 00:25:00.380 align:middle line:84%
These fundamental
laws of energy,

00:25:00.380 --> 00:25:02.180 align:middle line:84%
they're playing out
each day of our lives.

00:25:02.180 --> 00:25:04.060 align:middle line:10%
They're playing out
this very minute

00:25:04.060 --> 00:25:05.840 align:middle line:10%
in every relationship
of your life

00:25:05.840 --> 00:25:09.760 align:middle line:10%
and every situation that you
face, in every condition that

00:25:09.760 --> 00:25:13.790 align:middle line:10%
is unfolding, and you
are finding yourself

00:25:13.790 --> 00:25:16.070 align:middle line:10%
in relationship to these laws.

00:25:16.070 --> 00:25:18.560 align:middle line:84%
And everything, from the most
joys to the most frightening

00:25:18.560 --> 00:25:22.610 align:middle line:84%
experiences, the whole
idea of a simulation

00:25:22.610 --> 00:25:25.910 align:middle line:84%
is for those that are
using the simulation

00:25:25.910 --> 00:25:27.530 align:middle line:84%
to master the
conditions that they

00:25:27.530 --> 00:25:29.443 align:middle line:90%
find themselves experiencing.

00:25:29.443 --> 00:25:31.610 align:middle line:90%
All right, we are the people.

00:25:31.610 --> 00:25:34.160 align:middle line:84%
This is our
simulation, and we are

00:25:34.160 --> 00:25:37.880 align:middle line:84%
living in a world of
energy, information,

00:25:37.880 --> 00:25:39.290 align:middle line:84%
and we're creating
the conditions

00:25:39.290 --> 00:25:40.670 align:middle line:90%
that we are learning to master.

00:25:40.670 --> 00:25:43.940 align:middle line:84%
And as we master those
conditions of our lives,

00:25:43.940 --> 00:25:49.860 align:middle line:84%
we master the laws of
the simulation as well.

00:25:49.860 --> 00:25:51.830 align:middle line:84%
Now that we've
identified the laws that

00:25:51.830 --> 00:25:54.230 align:middle line:84%
govern our virtual
world, we have

00:25:54.230 --> 00:25:57.530 align:middle line:84%
everything we need to dive
directly into the deepest

00:25:57.530 --> 00:26:00.260 align:middle line:84%
questions of what
our simulation means

00:26:00.260 --> 00:26:02.540 align:middle line:84%
to us in our everyday
lives and then discover

00:26:02.540 --> 00:26:04.990 align:middle line:84%
powerful new
perspectives regarding

00:26:04.990 --> 00:26:08.000 align:middle line:84%
our origin, our history,
our destiny, and our fate.

00:26:08.000 --> 00:26:10.970 align:middle line:84%
I want to thank you for
joining me for today's program.

00:26:10.970 --> 00:26:13.430 align:middle line:84%
And be sure to tune in
for our next all-new

00:26:13.430 --> 00:26:15.710 align:middle line:90%
episode of "Missing Links".

00:26:15.710 --> 00:26:19.550 align:middle line:84%
Simulation by design, are we
living in a virtual reality?

00:26:19.550 --> 00:26:21.700 align:middle line:90%
