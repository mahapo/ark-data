00:00:26.124 --> 00:00:27.040 align:middle line:90%
>>GREGG BRADEN: Hello.

00:00:27.040 --> 00:00:28.039 align:middle line:90%
My name is Gregg Braden.

00:00:28.039 --> 00:00:31.340 align:middle line:10%
And I'd like to welcome you to
this very special presentation

00:00:31.340 --> 00:00:34.460 align:middle line:10%
of "Missing Links,
Simulation by Design,

00:00:34.460 --> 00:00:37.310 align:middle line:10%
Are We Living in a
Virtual Reality?"

00:00:37.310 --> 00:00:40.640 align:middle line:84%
Well, in the last episode,
we identified the laws

00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:43.910 align:middle line:84%
that govern our virtual world,
the basic laws of physics

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:47.360 align:middle line:84%
and what it takes to master
those laws in our lives.

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:50.030 align:middle line:84%
When we consider
these understandings

00:00:50.030 --> 00:00:52.070 align:middle line:84%
and we merge them
with everything else

00:00:52.070 --> 00:00:54.445 align:middle line:84%
that we've learned throughout
this entire series,

00:00:54.445 --> 00:00:57.290 align:middle line:84%
well that's enough to make our
head spin with possibilities.

00:00:57.290 --> 00:01:00.470 align:middle line:84%
And suddenly we have
a new way of thinking

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:04.550 align:middle line:84%
and a new vocabulary to describe
our relationship to the world

00:01:04.550 --> 00:01:05.630 align:middle line:90%
and the life itself.

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:08.210 align:middle line:90%
The implications are staggering.

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:10.080 align:middle line:90%
And the questions are endless.

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:13.349 align:middle line:84%
So in this final episode
of "Simulation by Design,"

00:01:13.349 --> 00:01:14.890 align:middle line:84%
we'll answer many
of those questions.

00:01:14.890 --> 00:01:18.050 align:middle line:84%
And by doing so, we
will come full circle

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:19.910 align:middle line:90%
to where we began this series.

00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:22.370 align:middle line:84%
Only now we have the
vocabulary to make

00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:26.310 align:middle line:90%
sense of our virtual reality.

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:29.040 align:middle line:84%
In this program, you've
seen the evidence

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:32.490 align:middle line:84%
that tells us it is more
likely than not that we

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:37.650 align:middle line:84%
are living in a simulated
world, in a virtual universe.

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:41.030 align:middle line:84%
And you've seen the
evidence that is telling you

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:46.020 align:middle line:84%
that you have the potential to
interact with this universe,

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:49.860 align:middle line:84%
to interact with this reality in
ways that have seemed mystical

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:52.680 align:middle line:84%
in the past, and reserved
for the monks, and nuns,

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:59.100 align:middle line:84%
and the abbots, and the shamans
living mystical lifestyles.

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:01.680 align:middle line:84%
Now we know we don't need to
live on a monastery halfway

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:04.560 align:middle line:84%
around the world and leave
everything familiar to us--

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:08.100 align:middle line:84%
our loved ones, our jobs,
our families; to embrace

00:02:08.100 --> 00:02:10.590 align:middle line:90%
these seemingly mystical powers.

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:12.780 align:middle line:84%
Because when we understand
the relationships,

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:14.790 align:middle line:90%
we demystify the experience.

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:17.810 align:middle line:84%
In the contemporary
language of science

00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:20.910 align:middle line:84%
we are now talking about
mystical connections

00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:22.890 align:middle line:84%
and we are marrying
those connections

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:25.250 align:middle line:84%
with the best science
of the modern world

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:30.030 align:middle line:84%
to give us a new view,
an evolutionary edge,

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:32.760 align:middle line:84%
to understand what's
happening in our world

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:37.420 align:middle line:84%
and beyond that how we may
direct the events of our lives

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:39.900 align:middle line:84%
and the events of the world
in a positive, powerful way.

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:44.120 align:middle line:90%


00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:46.990 align:middle line:10%
So, as you've
seen, the parallels

00:02:46.990 --> 00:02:50.380 align:middle line:10%
between the laws of physics
as we know them today

00:02:50.380 --> 00:02:53.390 align:middle line:10%
and the rules of the simulation,
are absolutely clear.

00:02:53.390 --> 00:02:55.270 align:middle line:90%
They're unmistakable.

00:02:55.270 --> 00:02:57.490 align:middle line:84%
And the evidence is showing
us more likely than not,

00:02:57.490 --> 00:02:59.180 align:middle line:84%
we are, in fact
in the simulation.

00:02:59.180 --> 00:03:02.780 align:middle line:84%
So what I'd like to do
in this last segment now,

00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:04.510 align:middle line:90%
is pull all of this together.

00:03:04.510 --> 00:03:06.540 align:middle line:84%
Let's get down to
the nuts and bolts

00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:07.930 align:middle line:90%
of what this experience means.

00:03:07.930 --> 00:03:12.130 align:middle line:84%
Let's jump right into what it
means to be in a simulation--

00:03:12.130 --> 00:03:14.500 align:middle line:84%
the implications and
the questions that

00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:16.090 align:middle line:90%
invariably come up.

00:03:16.090 --> 00:03:20.470 align:middle line:84%
Questions like, where is
heaven; where is heaven?

00:03:20.470 --> 00:03:23.470 align:middle line:84%
When we think about
our simulation

00:03:23.470 --> 00:03:27.790 align:middle line:84%
and we think of the
descriptions of heaven, the word

00:03:27.790 --> 00:03:32.990 align:middle line:84%
itself was left to us
about 2,500 years ago.

00:03:32.990 --> 00:03:35.980 align:middle line:84%
What does that mean to us
in terms of the simulation?

00:03:35.980 --> 00:03:39.900 align:middle line:84%
Well, the simulation is
a localized experience.

00:03:39.900 --> 00:03:43.060 align:middle line:84%
But it tells us,
we're not really here.

00:03:43.060 --> 00:03:44.920 align:middle line:90%
You're not really here.

00:03:44.920 --> 00:03:49.510 align:middle line:84%
We exist somewhere outside
of the simulation and we are

00:03:49.510 --> 00:03:53.230 align:middle line:84%
projecting our energetic
body, what we call our spirit

00:03:53.230 --> 00:03:59.470 align:middle line:84%
or our soul or our avatar, into
this experience so that we can

00:03:59.470 --> 00:04:02.869 align:middle line:84%
learn something here that
apparently we cannot learn

00:04:02.869 --> 00:04:05.410 align:middle line:84%
where we've come from and that
apparently we're going to need

00:04:05.410 --> 00:04:07.480 align:middle line:90%
wherever we are going.

00:04:07.480 --> 00:04:10.540 align:middle line:84%
Now this is a really,
really powerful concept.

00:04:10.540 --> 00:04:12.820 align:middle line:84%
The idea that we are not
here-- and the biology

00:04:12.820 --> 00:04:13.800 align:middle line:90%
actually supports it.

00:04:13.800 --> 00:04:16.870 align:middle line:84%
What the biology
is showing us is

00:04:16.870 --> 00:04:20.740 align:middle line:84%
that our cells
receive information

00:04:20.740 --> 00:04:22.690 align:middle line:90%
that defines who we are.

00:04:22.690 --> 00:04:25.060 align:middle line:84%
The surface of the
cells, the receptors,

00:04:25.060 --> 00:04:27.030 align:middle line:90%
receive this information.

00:04:27.030 --> 00:04:29.320 align:middle line:84%
And that's why when
we take our cells

00:04:29.320 --> 00:04:31.300 align:middle line:84%
and we put them into the
body of another person

00:04:31.300 --> 00:04:33.650 align:middle line:84%
through an organ
transplant, for example,

00:04:33.650 --> 00:04:35.260 align:middle line:90%
that person rejects the cells.

00:04:35.260 --> 00:04:36.880 align:middle line:90%
Because it's not them.

00:04:36.880 --> 00:04:41.320 align:middle line:84%
We have an identity and that
identity begins somewhere

00:04:41.320 --> 00:04:43.450 align:middle line:90%
beyond our simulation.

00:04:43.450 --> 00:04:47.620 align:middle line:84%
And in terms of the ancient text
that is what was called heaven.

00:04:47.620 --> 00:04:52.390 align:middle line:84%
When we leave our simulation,
we shift our consciousness.

00:04:52.390 --> 00:04:55.010 align:middle line:84%
We go back to where it
is that we came from.

00:04:55.010 --> 00:04:57.044 align:middle line:90%
And for me, I believe that.

00:04:57.044 --> 00:04:58.460 align:middle line:84%
And I think it's
really good news.

00:04:58.460 --> 00:05:00.793 align:middle line:84%
It means that we will see our
friends and our loved ones

00:05:00.793 --> 00:05:04.090 align:middle line:84%
again on the other side,
what is called the veil,

00:05:04.090 --> 00:05:06.270 align:middle line:90%
on the other side of that veil.

00:05:06.270 --> 00:05:09.700 align:middle line:84%
And I hope that there's
a time on that other side

00:05:09.700 --> 00:05:11.680 align:middle line:84%
that we can look back
and review everything

00:05:11.680 --> 00:05:13.990 align:middle line:84%
we've done in this world and
hopefully laugh about some

00:05:13.990 --> 00:05:16.450 align:middle line:84%
of the mistakes that
we've made, that we've

00:05:16.450 --> 00:05:19.630 align:middle line:84%
made while we were trying
to learn about ourselves

00:05:19.630 --> 00:05:20.870 align:middle line:90%
in this simulation.

00:05:20.870 --> 00:05:25.780 align:middle line:84%
So heaven, heaven I believe is
the ancient word for the world

00:05:25.780 --> 00:05:29.740 align:middle line:84%
that we live in that
exists on the other side,

00:05:29.740 --> 00:05:34.480 align:middle line:84%
outside of the simulation that
we find ourselves in right now.

00:05:34.480 --> 00:05:37.660 align:middle line:84%
So the next question, what
does that mean for death?

00:05:37.660 --> 00:05:40.120 align:middle line:90%
Where do we go when we die?

00:05:40.120 --> 00:05:42.580 align:middle line:84%
If this simulation
theory works the way

00:05:42.580 --> 00:05:45.040 align:middle line:84%
that the science suggests
and the way that I

00:05:45.040 --> 00:05:48.834 align:middle line:84%
believe that the
evidence is directing us,

00:05:48.834 --> 00:05:49.750 align:middle line:90%
it's really good news.

00:05:49.750 --> 00:05:51.625 align:middle line:84%
Because it means
when we die, what

00:05:51.625 --> 00:05:58.060 align:middle line:84%
we call death is the end of
this representation of us

00:05:58.060 --> 00:06:03.100 align:middle line:84%
in this limited simulation,
what we would call our avatar,

00:06:03.100 --> 00:06:07.900 align:middle line:84%
just as we're seeing portrayed
in the films, in the media.

00:06:07.900 --> 00:06:11.890 align:middle line:84%
Again consciousness
reminding us of ourselves,

00:06:11.890 --> 00:06:16.270 align:middle line:84%
communicating with us, informing
us of the reality of our world,

00:06:16.270 --> 00:06:18.530 align:middle line:90%
consciously and subconsciously.

00:06:18.530 --> 00:06:22.510 align:middle line:84%
So when we die this
avatar no longer

00:06:22.510 --> 00:06:25.570 align:middle line:90%
exists in the physical realm.

00:06:25.570 --> 00:06:27.460 align:middle line:10%
But our essence
that we've projected

00:06:27.460 --> 00:06:30.990 align:middle line:10%
continues in the
realm outside, perhaps

00:06:30.990 --> 00:06:32.830 align:middle line:10%
in another physical body.

00:06:32.830 --> 00:06:34.210 align:middle line:90%
So once again, we think back.

00:06:34.210 --> 00:06:36.800 align:middle line:84%
What is the purpose
of the simulation?

00:06:36.800 --> 00:06:42.670 align:middle line:84%
Simulation is to learn a new
way of being in a realm that

00:06:42.670 --> 00:06:46.510 align:middle line:84%
is relatively safe, because
we need that way of being

00:06:46.510 --> 00:06:49.190 align:middle line:90%
when we go to another place.

00:06:49.190 --> 00:06:52.510 align:middle line:84%
So if we are individually,
collectively,

00:06:52.510 --> 00:06:56.040 align:middle line:84%
outside of our simulation, we're
in a control room somewhere,

00:06:56.040 --> 00:07:00.660 align:middle line:84%
we're in some kind of a
technological environment.

00:07:00.660 --> 00:07:03.240 align:middle line:84%
And we'll talk about this
in just a few minutes, where

00:07:03.240 --> 00:07:06.430 align:middle line:84%
whatever has happened in
our world is telling us

00:07:06.430 --> 00:07:09.150 align:middle line:84%
that we need to learn
a new way of being.

00:07:09.150 --> 00:07:14.380 align:middle line:84%
Here we are in this
situation and we are

00:07:14.380 --> 00:07:15.740 align:middle line:90%
learning what we're learning.

00:07:15.740 --> 00:07:17.740 align:middle line:84%
One of the things that I
find really interesting

00:07:17.740 --> 00:07:19.960 align:middle line:90%
is the concept of time.

00:07:19.960 --> 00:07:23.410 align:middle line:84%
You know, I think you
know that astronauts,

00:07:23.410 --> 00:07:27.550 align:middle line:84%
for example, when they
travel they age differently.

00:07:27.550 --> 00:07:30.130 align:middle line:84%
Their bodies age differently
than we do here on Earth.

00:07:30.130 --> 00:07:33.230 align:middle line:84%
This is about Einstein's
theory of relativity.

00:07:33.230 --> 00:07:38.380 align:middle line:84%
So, the thinking is that in the
future when we have astronauts

00:07:38.380 --> 00:07:41.080 align:middle line:84%
that leave the
earth, leave the moon

00:07:41.080 --> 00:07:43.180 align:middle line:84%
and go deep into the solar
system and maybe even

00:07:43.180 --> 00:07:49.120 align:middle line:84%
beyond, that they will age
slower than their husbands,

00:07:49.120 --> 00:07:52.210 align:middle line:84%
wives, families, their
children here on Earth.

00:07:52.210 --> 00:07:55.179 align:middle line:84%
And if they should ever return,
they would actually be younger,

00:07:55.179 --> 00:07:57.220 align:middle line:84%
and those that they'd left
behind would be older.

00:07:57.220 --> 00:08:01.335 align:middle line:84%
That tells us that our
simulation, the relationship

00:08:01.335 --> 00:08:02.710 align:middle line:84%
with time in our
simulation, what

00:08:02.710 --> 00:08:04.960 align:middle line:84%
seems like a lifetime to us,
what seems like a hundred

00:08:04.960 --> 00:08:10.510 align:middle line:84%
years, may only be a few moments
of time in the control room

00:08:10.510 --> 00:08:12.430 align:middle line:90%
outside of our simulation.

00:08:12.430 --> 00:08:16.760 align:middle line:84%
That it's all relative in terms
of the way we think about this.

00:08:16.760 --> 00:08:20.905 align:middle line:84%
The idea of God comes up a lot
when we talk about simulation.

00:08:20.905 --> 00:08:25.320 align:middle line:84%
And once again, I just invite
you to think about this.

00:08:25.320 --> 00:08:31.800 align:middle line:84%
We are now talking about
this very, very deep concept

00:08:31.800 --> 00:08:34.380 align:middle line:90%
in this contemporary language.

00:08:34.380 --> 00:08:38.520 align:middle line:84%
But those who understood
this simulation, those

00:08:38.520 --> 00:08:41.490 align:middle line:84%
who understood that we're
temporarily learning something

00:08:41.490 --> 00:08:44.880 align:middle line:84%
and that we're going to go to
another world; how in the world

00:08:44.880 --> 00:08:48.920 align:middle line:84%
would they have shared this
with the people of their time

00:08:48.920 --> 00:08:52.950 align:middle line:84%
2,000, 2,500, 3,000,
5,000 years ago?

00:08:52.950 --> 00:08:55.040 align:middle line:84%
When we look into
the ancient texts,

00:08:55.040 --> 00:08:57.630 align:middle line:84%
and I've spent much
of my adult life

00:08:57.630 --> 00:09:01.320 align:middle line:84%
searching not only the
contemporary texts, but also

00:09:01.320 --> 00:09:05.670 align:middle line:84%
the mystical texts and the
texts that have been relegated

00:09:05.670 --> 00:09:07.320 align:middle line:84%
to mystical texts,
because they were

00:09:07.320 --> 00:09:10.410 align:middle line:84%
deleted from the contemporary
canon of the Bible,

00:09:10.410 --> 00:09:12.040 align:middle line:90%
for example.

00:09:12.040 --> 00:09:15.390 align:middle line:84%
And not only the Christian,
Bible but the Hebrew Bible,

00:09:15.390 --> 00:09:18.840 align:middle line:84%
beyond the Torah, beyond
the first five books--

00:09:18.840 --> 00:09:21.870 align:middle line:84%
Genesis, Exodus, Leviticus,
Numbers and Deuteronomy;

00:09:21.870 --> 00:09:23.400 align:middle line:84%
there are other
Hebrew texts that

00:09:23.400 --> 00:09:27.130 align:middle line:84%
were also edited and
relegated to mystical texts.

00:09:27.130 --> 00:09:29.400 align:middle line:84%
They're not part of
the contemporary canon.

00:09:29.400 --> 00:09:32.520 align:middle line:84%
So, when we go back and we
look at those deleted texts

00:09:32.520 --> 00:09:35.880 align:middle line:84%
and the way that they were
condensed, we see a story.

00:09:35.880 --> 00:09:39.750 align:middle line:84%
And the story tells us
that in the beginning,

00:09:39.750 --> 00:09:43.020 align:middle line:84%
so whether you think the natural
beginning of the Big Bang

00:09:43.020 --> 00:09:46.080 align:middle line:84%
or you think the beginning
of our simulation.

00:09:46.080 --> 00:09:50.340 align:middle line:84%
In the beginning, there
was a prime creator

00:09:50.340 --> 00:09:52.505 align:middle line:90%
and that is the idea of God.

00:09:52.505 --> 00:09:56.790 align:middle line:84%
But the texts also tell us
that God did not create us.

00:09:56.790 --> 00:09:59.940 align:middle line:90%
God created the environment.

00:09:59.940 --> 00:10:04.050 align:middle line:90%
God created the universe.

00:10:04.050 --> 00:10:06.150 align:middle line:84%
But when you go into
those mystical texts.

00:10:06.150 --> 00:10:10.280 align:middle line:84%
It says that humans were
created by groups, they.

00:10:10.280 --> 00:10:13.980 align:middle line:84%
It says when they
created the first humans.

00:10:13.980 --> 00:10:16.560 align:middle line:10%
And it goes on to describe
in the book of the Haggadah,

00:10:16.560 --> 00:10:22.140 align:middle line:10%
for example, one of the
gnostic texts of the Mandaeans,

00:10:22.140 --> 00:10:23.130 align:middle line:10%
they created.

00:10:23.130 --> 00:10:25.950 align:middle line:84%
And when you go into the deleted
texts in the Christian Bible,

00:10:25.950 --> 00:10:29.280 align:middle line:90%
they created the first humans.

00:10:29.280 --> 00:10:31.890 align:middle line:84%
And what I find even
more interesting

00:10:31.890 --> 00:10:35.340 align:middle line:84%
is that when those texts talk
about the creation of humans

00:10:35.340 --> 00:10:42.310 align:middle line:84%
they say that a very
specific formula of human

00:10:42.310 --> 00:10:45.730 align:middle line:84%
had to be created to hold
the energy of the soul

00:10:45.730 --> 00:10:47.955 align:middle line:90%
or the spirit in this realm.

00:10:47.955 --> 00:10:49.720 align:middle line:90%
Now what does that mean?

00:10:49.720 --> 00:10:52.780 align:middle line:84%
When we think now
about a simulation,

00:10:52.780 --> 00:10:56.410 align:middle line:84%
we know that it takes a
certain genetic makeup

00:10:56.410 --> 00:11:01.770 align:middle line:84%
to hold the energy of the spirit
or the soul, the consciousness

00:11:01.770 --> 00:11:03.430 align:middle line:90%
that we bring into this world.

00:11:03.430 --> 00:11:07.250 align:middle line:84%
And apparently not
any old formula of DNA

00:11:07.250 --> 00:11:09.280 align:middle line:90%
was up to the task.

00:11:09.280 --> 00:11:13.690 align:middle line:84%
So, when we look into our past
and we find forms of life that

00:11:13.690 --> 00:11:17.950 align:middle line:84%
were perhaps not as conscious,
not as evolved as us;

00:11:17.950 --> 00:11:22.090 align:middle line:84%
in the simulation idea,
these are the forms

00:11:22.090 --> 00:11:24.190 align:middle line:90%
of life, the first forms.

00:11:24.190 --> 00:11:27.790 align:middle line:84%
They were the early attempts
to create the avatars

00:11:27.790 --> 00:11:30.550 align:middle line:90%
in this simulated world.

00:11:30.550 --> 00:11:33.730 align:middle line:84%
But their genetic makeup
was not strong enough

00:11:33.730 --> 00:11:35.410 align:middle line:90%
to hold the energy of the soul.

00:11:35.410 --> 00:11:38.890 align:middle line:84%
You and I are the product
of a genetic formula,

00:11:38.890 --> 00:11:41.140 align:middle line:90%
a very specific form of DNA.

00:11:41.140 --> 00:11:43.030 align:middle line:84%
And apparently it
is this form that's

00:11:43.030 --> 00:11:47.230 align:middle line:84%
required to hold the energy
of the soul in this simulation

00:11:47.230 --> 00:11:49.840 align:middle line:84%
experience so that we
could have the experiences,

00:11:49.840 --> 00:11:52.450 align:middle line:84%
learn what we're
learning, and maintain

00:11:52.450 --> 00:11:55.480 align:middle line:84%
the consciousness
that we have as we

00:11:55.480 --> 00:11:57.382 align:middle line:90%
go through our experience.

00:11:57.382 --> 00:11:58.840 align:middle line:84%
So, once again,
what we're doing is

00:11:58.840 --> 00:12:01.540 align:middle line:84%
we're taking these
very ancient ideas

00:12:01.540 --> 00:12:05.080 align:middle line:84%
and we're rethinking them
with a contemporary language,

00:12:05.080 --> 00:12:07.390 align:middle line:84%
based on what the best
science of the modern world

00:12:07.390 --> 00:12:10.130 align:middle line:84%
is now suggesting
is the realities

00:12:10.130 --> 00:12:11.800 align:middle line:90%
that we're experiencing.

00:12:11.800 --> 00:12:16.000 align:middle line:84%
So, heaven, where do we go
when when we die, what is God;

00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:17.950 align:middle line:84%
all of these now take
on a new meaning.

00:12:17.950 --> 00:12:21.160 align:middle line:84%
God, whoever god
is apparently is

00:12:21.160 --> 00:12:27.334 align:middle line:84%
the architect that was a primary
designer of this simulation.

00:12:27.334 --> 00:12:29.500 align:middle line:84%
And I'm looking forward to
getting to the other side

00:12:29.500 --> 00:12:33.880 align:middle line:84%
in meeting that architect
at some point in our future.

00:12:33.880 --> 00:12:35.620 align:middle line:84%
Perhaps the biggest
question that

00:12:35.620 --> 00:12:39.070 align:middle line:84%
comes up when I
have conversations

00:12:39.070 --> 00:12:42.940 align:middle line:84%
with other scientists and people
about what you and I are doing

00:12:42.940 --> 00:12:46.990 align:middle line:84%
right now, considering the
possibility of this simulation,

00:12:46.990 --> 00:12:49.660 align:middle line:84%
this virtual environment;
the big question

00:12:49.660 --> 00:12:54.010 align:middle line:84%
is how long could this
simulation possibly last.

00:12:54.010 --> 00:12:55.510 align:middle line:90%
How does it end?

00:12:55.510 --> 00:12:57.190 align:middle line:90%
What could cause it to end?

00:12:57.190 --> 00:12:58.690 align:middle line:84%
And to answer this
question, this

00:12:58.690 --> 00:13:02.290 align:middle line:84%
is precisely why I took
a little bit of time

00:13:02.290 --> 00:13:05.990 align:middle line:84%
in the previous episodes to
talk about the fractal patterns,

00:13:05.990 --> 00:13:10.150 align:middle line:84%
for example, and the fractal
codes, the Koch snowflake,

00:13:10.150 --> 00:13:13.060 align:middle line:84%
showing us about the
complexity of the parameter

00:13:13.060 --> 00:13:15.370 align:middle line:84%
and how it can change
while the space

00:13:15.370 --> 00:13:17.680 align:middle line:84%
that the snowflake
actually occupies

00:13:17.680 --> 00:13:19.780 align:middle line:90%
remains relatively constant.

00:13:19.780 --> 00:13:22.600 align:middle line:84%
All of those ideas now I'm
going to bring them together

00:13:22.600 --> 00:13:26.500 align:middle line:84%
to answer the question, how
long can our simulation last.

00:13:26.500 --> 00:13:28.750 align:middle line:90%
What would cause it to end?

00:13:28.750 --> 00:13:30.910 align:middle line:84%
In a simulation
environment, when

00:13:30.910 --> 00:13:33.100 align:middle line:84%
we ask ourselves
what could possibly

00:13:33.100 --> 00:13:37.590 align:middle line:84%
end this virtual reality,
this world that we know,

00:13:37.590 --> 00:13:41.600 align:middle line:84%
the end would be the same as
it is for any computer program.

00:13:41.600 --> 00:13:44.750 align:middle line:84%
When one of two possible
conditions exists,

00:13:44.750 --> 00:13:47.110 align:middle line:90%
the end of the program occurs.

00:13:47.110 --> 00:13:50.050 align:middle line:84%
Number one is when
the system runs out

00:13:50.050 --> 00:13:54.520 align:middle line:84%
of space to store the
information that is generated.

00:13:54.520 --> 00:13:57.610 align:middle line:84%
Number two is when
something unexpected

00:13:57.610 --> 00:14:01.070 align:middle line:84%
happens that corrupts
the entire system.

00:14:01.070 --> 00:14:03.070 align:middle line:84%
So let's take a
look at these two

00:14:03.070 --> 00:14:06.640 align:middle line:84%
very well-known possibilities
for conventional computer

00:14:06.640 --> 00:14:07.690 align:middle line:90%
programs.

00:14:07.690 --> 00:14:10.150 align:middle line:84%
And let's see how
they might apply

00:14:10.150 --> 00:14:14.860 align:middle line:84%
and what they may mean for
our simulated environment.

00:14:14.860 --> 00:14:19.600 align:middle line:10%
Before his death in 2008,
Princeton University Professor,

00:14:19.600 --> 00:14:23.410 align:middle line:10%
John Wheeler, a physicist, he
was a contemporary of Albert

00:14:23.410 --> 00:14:24.830 align:middle line:10%
Einstein's.

00:14:24.830 --> 00:14:28.810 align:middle line:84%
But he and Albert Einstein
had very, very different ideas

00:14:28.810 --> 00:14:32.050 align:middle line:84%
of our relationship to
our physical reality.

00:14:32.050 --> 00:14:35.800 align:middle line:84%
Nothing could have been
more diverse than the way

00:14:35.800 --> 00:14:39.100 align:middle line:84%
that these two men, looking
at the same information,

00:14:39.100 --> 00:14:41.480 align:middle line:84%
the same data,
the same formulas;

00:14:41.480 --> 00:14:44.050 align:middle line:84%
fought about our
relationship to the world.

00:14:44.050 --> 00:14:47.740 align:middle line:84%
And they came up with very,
very different perspectives.

00:14:47.740 --> 00:14:50.260 align:middle line:10%
Albert Einstein,
brilliant man that

00:14:50.260 --> 00:14:55.990 align:middle line:10%
was, he did not like the idea
that we could be so deeply

00:14:55.990 --> 00:14:59.260 align:middle line:10%
connected with our environment
that we could actually

00:14:59.260 --> 00:15:03.580 align:middle line:10%
influence our environment
and especially at a distance.

00:15:03.580 --> 00:15:07.510 align:middle line:84%
Albert Einstein did not like
the idea of entanglement.

00:15:07.510 --> 00:15:11.140 align:middle line:10%
These theories were just being
developed during his lifetime.

00:15:11.140 --> 00:15:13.930 align:middle line:10%
And when he heard that
it may be possible

00:15:13.930 --> 00:15:16.645 align:middle line:10%
for us to influence
from where we

00:15:16.645 --> 00:15:18.520 align:middle line:10%
are one part of the
world to what's happening

00:15:18.520 --> 00:15:20.228 align:middle line:10%
in another part of
the world, he actually

00:15:20.228 --> 00:15:22.490 align:middle line:10%
have a term for that
kind of influence.

00:15:22.490 --> 00:15:25.810 align:middle line:84%
He called it spooky
action at a distance.

00:15:25.810 --> 00:15:27.370 align:middle line:90%
Einstein didn't like that.

00:15:27.370 --> 00:15:30.790 align:middle line:84%
And he went to his
grave with a frustration

00:15:30.790 --> 00:15:34.300 align:middle line:84%
of never being able to
unify the laws of physics,

00:15:34.300 --> 00:15:36.685 align:middle line:84%
because he did not allow
for this relationship,

00:15:36.685 --> 00:15:39.680 align:middle line:84%
this entanglement that
we see in our world.

00:15:39.680 --> 00:15:40.680 align:middle line:90%
This is on the one hand.

00:15:40.680 --> 00:15:42.840 align:middle line:84%
On the other hand,
John Wheeler came up

00:15:42.840 --> 00:15:46.290 align:middle line:84%
with a completely different
view of the universe.

00:15:46.290 --> 00:15:49.860 align:middle line:84%
Wheeler said the universe
could not exist without us.

00:15:49.860 --> 00:15:53.730 align:middle line:84%
He said that we are part
of an ongoing process.

00:15:53.730 --> 00:15:55.920 align:middle line:84%
He said the universe
isn't finished yet.

00:15:55.920 --> 00:15:59.430 align:middle line:84%
He said it is
continually being built.

00:15:59.430 --> 00:16:01.890 align:middle line:84%
We are continually
adding to the universe

00:16:01.890 --> 00:16:04.410 align:middle line:84%
and we're doing it
through consciousness.

00:16:04.410 --> 00:16:06.830 align:middle line:10%
He said, we live
in what he called--

00:16:06.830 --> 00:16:10.590 align:middle line:10%
and I'm going to quote-- "a
participatory universe that

00:16:10.590 --> 00:16:13.100 align:middle line:10%
continues to build itself."

00:16:13.100 --> 00:16:15.770 align:middle line:10%
Well, the implications
of what John Wheeler said

00:16:15.770 --> 00:16:18.330 align:middle line:10%
have a direct
impact on the answer

00:16:18.330 --> 00:16:20.895 align:middle line:10%
to the question, how long
can our simulation last.

00:16:20.895 --> 00:16:23.650 align:middle line:90%
And here's the reason why.

00:16:23.650 --> 00:16:26.220 align:middle line:84%
What John Wheeler said
to us about living

00:16:26.220 --> 00:16:30.000 align:middle line:84%
in a participatory universe
suggests the following.

00:16:30.000 --> 00:16:34.020 align:middle line:84%
It suggests that we
will probably never find

00:16:34.020 --> 00:16:39.480 align:middle line:84%
the smallest particle of
matter, because every time we

00:16:39.480 --> 00:16:45.090 align:middle line:84%
peer deeper and deeper
into the fundamental nature

00:16:45.090 --> 00:16:46.395 align:middle line:90%
of our reality--

00:16:46.395 --> 00:16:48.390 align:middle line:84%
and this is what's
important here--

00:16:48.390 --> 00:16:54.920 align:middle line:84%
the act of us looking is an act
of creation in our simulation.

00:16:54.920 --> 00:16:58.320 align:middle line:84%
And it puts something
there for us to see.

00:16:58.320 --> 00:17:00.660 align:middle line:84%
So, the deeper we look,
every time scientists

00:17:00.660 --> 00:17:02.710 align:middle line:84%
think they've got the
smallest particle,

00:17:02.710 --> 00:17:04.410 align:middle line:84%
then they build new
equipment and they

00:17:04.410 --> 00:17:06.240 align:middle line:84%
find that they can
break that particle

00:17:06.240 --> 00:17:08.631 align:middle line:84%
and there's something
underlying that particle.

00:17:08.631 --> 00:17:11.089 align:middle line:84%
And then they do it again, and
they do it again, and again.

00:17:11.089 --> 00:17:14.970 align:middle line:84%
Now think about what this means
in terms of our simulation.

00:17:14.970 --> 00:17:18.950 align:middle line:84%
Every time we look and
consciousness puts something

00:17:18.950 --> 00:17:24.300 align:middle line:84%
there for us to see that
something is energy.

00:17:24.300 --> 00:17:26.280 align:middle line:90%
It is information.

00:17:26.280 --> 00:17:31.950 align:middle line:84%
And we are constantly adding
information to the system

00:17:31.950 --> 00:17:35.460 align:middle line:84%
through the act of
looking, searching,

00:17:35.460 --> 00:17:38.100 align:middle line:84%
to find the limits
of our experience.

00:17:38.100 --> 00:17:40.800 align:middle line:84%
So, the deeper we look into
the atom, the more information

00:17:40.800 --> 00:17:42.060 align:middle line:90%
we're putting out there.

00:17:42.060 --> 00:17:44.280 align:middle line:84%
The further we look
into the cosmos,

00:17:44.280 --> 00:17:47.070 align:middle line:84%
scientists are looking for
the edge of the universe.

00:17:47.070 --> 00:17:49.440 align:middle line:84%
And they thought
they found it twice.

00:17:49.440 --> 00:17:51.810 align:middle line:84%
They thought they
found the boundary that

00:17:51.810 --> 00:17:54.955 align:middle line:84%
marks the edge of our
physical universe.

00:17:54.955 --> 00:17:55.830 align:middle line:90%
Here's what happened.

00:17:55.830 --> 00:17:57.450 align:middle line:90%
They built new equipment.

00:17:57.450 --> 00:18:00.360 align:middle line:84%
And the new equipment
looked differently

00:18:00.360 --> 00:18:03.144 align:middle line:84%
at that boundary
and lo and behold,

00:18:03.144 --> 00:18:04.810 align:middle line:84%
they found that there
was something else

00:18:04.810 --> 00:18:07.080 align:middle line:90%
beyond the boundary.

00:18:07.080 --> 00:18:09.420 align:middle line:90%
I can't emphasize this enough.

00:18:09.420 --> 00:18:14.700 align:middle line:84%
Our act, the act of us
looking with the expectation

00:18:14.700 --> 00:18:19.050 align:middle line:84%
that we will see something,
is an act of creation

00:18:19.050 --> 00:18:21.840 align:middle line:90%
within our simulated universe.

00:18:21.840 --> 00:18:25.980 align:middle line:84%
And the more we create, the more
information we are generating.

00:18:25.980 --> 00:18:28.710 align:middle line:84%
And that information
has to go somewhere.

00:18:28.710 --> 00:18:34.310 align:middle line:84%
We are living in a finite
environment of our simulation.

00:18:34.310 --> 00:18:36.940 align:middle line:84%
And this is what the Koch
snowflake was telling us.

00:18:36.940 --> 00:18:40.860 align:middle line:84%
So the question is, how
much can we explore?

00:18:40.860 --> 00:18:43.470 align:middle line:84%
How much information
can we create?

00:18:43.470 --> 00:18:47.100 align:middle line:84%
How much energy can we
generate until our environment

00:18:47.100 --> 00:18:49.800 align:middle line:90%
is full and can hold no more?

00:18:49.800 --> 00:18:52.710 align:middle line:84%
And when we reach
that point, and I

00:18:52.710 --> 00:18:54.270 align:middle line:84%
don't know if it's
in the near future

00:18:54.270 --> 00:18:56.150 align:middle line:90%
or in the distant future.

00:18:56.150 --> 00:18:59.900 align:middle line:84%
But what the fractal code tells
us is that at some point--

00:18:59.900 --> 00:19:01.680 align:middle line:90%
remember the Koch snowflake.

00:19:01.680 --> 00:19:05.930 align:middle line:84%
It said we can
generate complexity.

00:19:05.930 --> 00:19:07.875 align:middle line:84%
But when it comes
to the actual space

00:19:07.875 --> 00:19:10.110 align:middle line:84%
that the snowflake
takes, it levels out.

00:19:10.110 --> 00:19:12.630 align:middle line:90%
It doesn't go on forever.

00:19:12.630 --> 00:19:17.340 align:middle line:84%
When we reach that level that
suggests that our simulation

00:19:17.340 --> 00:19:18.647 align:middle line:90%
would come to an end.

00:19:18.647 --> 00:19:20.730 align:middle line:84%
And this is really
interesting, because scientists

00:19:20.730 --> 00:19:22.710 align:middle line:84%
are telling us now
that we are doubling--

00:19:22.710 --> 00:19:26.620 align:middle line:84%
doubling the amount of
information that comes to us.

00:19:26.620 --> 00:19:30.450 align:middle line:84%
And at least every year we are
doubling what we have known.

00:19:30.450 --> 00:19:33.570 align:middle line:84%
It took 5,000 years
for the first doubling.

00:19:33.570 --> 00:19:35.850 align:middle line:84%
And now the second
and third and fourth

00:19:35.850 --> 00:19:37.890 align:middle line:90%
we're doubling every year.

00:19:37.890 --> 00:19:40.470 align:middle line:84%
So it means that we are
generating more information,

00:19:40.470 --> 00:19:42.720 align:middle line:84%
more energy than we
ever have in the past.

00:19:42.720 --> 00:19:46.140 align:middle line:84%
How long can we do that
before our simulation is full?

00:19:46.140 --> 00:19:48.660 align:middle line:90%
Before the storage device--

00:19:48.660 --> 00:19:50.110 align:middle line:90%
I don't think it's a hard drive.

00:19:50.110 --> 00:19:53.820 align:middle line:84%
I think we will have transcended
the hard drives by the time

00:19:53.820 --> 00:19:56.460 align:middle line:90%
the simulation is understood.

00:19:56.460 --> 00:19:58.920 align:middle line:84%
But whatever it is that's
generating this information,

00:19:58.920 --> 00:20:00.470 align:middle line:90%
how much energy can it hold?

00:20:00.470 --> 00:20:03.510 align:middle line:90%


00:20:03.510 --> 00:20:06.400 align:middle line:84%
So, for the first
time in human history,

00:20:06.400 --> 00:20:09.480 align:middle line:84%
we have a reason to question
how much information can we

00:20:09.480 --> 00:20:13.620 align:middle line:84%
generate and store in the
field that connects all things

00:20:13.620 --> 00:20:16.924 align:middle line:84%
before that field
actually reaches capacity.

00:20:16.924 --> 00:20:18.090 align:middle line:10%
I don't know the answer now.

00:20:18.090 --> 00:20:21.600 align:middle line:10%
But I think we're going to
find out within our lifetimes.

00:20:21.600 --> 00:20:26.070 align:middle line:84%
The very fact that we
are in a simulation

00:20:26.070 --> 00:20:28.770 align:middle line:84%
tells us something
very, very powerful.

00:20:28.770 --> 00:20:32.700 align:middle line:84%
It tells us because we are
here that we are either near

00:20:32.700 --> 00:20:35.100 align:middle line:84%
or that we've already
reached a place

00:20:35.100 --> 00:20:38.820 align:middle line:84%
in our evolutionary process
where we need a simulation.

00:20:38.820 --> 00:20:41.480 align:middle line:84%
We were already at
a place where we

00:20:41.480 --> 00:20:44.930 align:middle line:84%
need to find a new way of
being, a new way of living,

00:20:44.930 --> 00:20:47.030 align:middle line:90%
a new way of thinking.

00:20:47.030 --> 00:20:50.460 align:middle line:84%
Now it may be because
of a climate change.

00:20:50.460 --> 00:20:53.070 align:middle line:84%
Maybe we are an
advanced civilization.

00:20:53.070 --> 00:20:56.150 align:middle line:84%
We are an advanced
society living right here

00:20:56.150 --> 00:20:59.420 align:middle line:84%
on planet Earth or
maybe some other world.

00:20:59.420 --> 00:21:02.730 align:middle line:84%
And we've experienced
climate change.

00:21:02.730 --> 00:21:06.000 align:middle line:84%
And we did not know
how to address it.

00:21:06.000 --> 00:21:08.570 align:middle line:84%
And the planet is no longer
hospitable for that reason.

00:21:08.570 --> 00:21:11.480 align:middle line:84%
Or maybe we've had a
pandemic disease or maybe

00:21:11.480 --> 00:21:12.890 align:middle line:90%
we've had an atomic war.

00:21:12.890 --> 00:21:16.400 align:middle line:84%
Maybe we're close to one of
these and we are searching.

00:21:16.400 --> 00:21:19.820 align:middle line:84%
We are simulating environments,
searching for ways

00:21:19.820 --> 00:21:23.862 align:middle line:84%
so that we can avoid these
great crises in our lives.

00:21:23.862 --> 00:21:25.820 align:middle line:84%
And when I've said this
to people in the past--

00:21:25.820 --> 00:21:27.560 align:middle line:90%
I've had this conversation--

00:21:27.560 --> 00:21:30.590 align:middle line:84%
I've said it to a large
audience, I've said one on one.

00:21:30.590 --> 00:21:33.950 align:middle line:84%
And when I suggest these
possibilities of actually

00:21:33.950 --> 00:21:37.070 align:middle line:84%
seeing scientists look
at me, and they tear up

00:21:37.070 --> 00:21:39.680 align:middle line:84%
and they cry when they
hear this possibly.

00:21:39.680 --> 00:21:42.960 align:middle line:84%
Because it touches something
very deep and very real

00:21:42.960 --> 00:21:44.000 align:middle line:90%
within each of us.

00:21:44.000 --> 00:21:46.820 align:middle line:84%
I think we all know that
we're here for a reason.

00:21:46.820 --> 00:21:49.220 align:middle line:84%
We all know that there's
something much, much bigger

00:21:49.220 --> 00:21:51.540 align:middle line:84%
happening then what
we've come to understand

00:21:51.540 --> 00:21:53.510 align:middle line:84%
and what we've been
led to believe.

00:21:53.510 --> 00:21:56.690 align:middle line:84%
So I'm sharing the possibilities
that the evidence suggests.

00:21:56.690 --> 00:22:00.140 align:middle line:84%
The possibility of
running out of space

00:22:00.140 --> 00:22:03.290 align:middle line:84%
in our simulation that was
only one possibility of what

00:22:03.290 --> 00:22:05.580 align:middle line:90%
could end this experience.

00:22:05.580 --> 00:22:09.620 align:middle line:84%
The second is an unexpected
event, a tremendous release

00:22:09.620 --> 00:22:11.680 align:middle line:90%
of energy of some kind.

00:22:11.680 --> 00:22:15.530 align:middle line:84%
And that thinking
coincides with the theme

00:22:15.530 --> 00:22:18.590 align:middle line:84%
of what our simulation is
all about to begin with.

00:22:18.590 --> 00:22:23.870 align:middle line:84%
The theme of life on Earth
for the last 5,000 years

00:22:23.870 --> 00:22:27.530 align:middle line:84%
has been primarily a
theme of war and conflict.

00:22:27.530 --> 00:22:32.180 align:middle line:84%
For over 5,000 years, humans
have almost continuously been

00:22:32.180 --> 00:22:36.380 align:middle line:84%
in conflict to one degree or
another in one form or another.

00:22:36.380 --> 00:22:39.670 align:middle line:84%
And the consistency
of that experience

00:22:39.670 --> 00:22:44.130 align:middle line:84%
suggests that it must play a
powerful role in our simulation

00:22:44.130 --> 00:22:47.440 align:middle line:84%
and why we're here
to begin with.

00:22:47.440 --> 00:22:50.990 align:middle line:84%
Now the archaeological record
preserves that history.

00:22:50.990 --> 00:22:54.450 align:middle line:84%
And it tells us of different
kinds of global conflict.

00:22:54.450 --> 00:22:57.170 align:middle line:84%
And for me, this is the
value of looking at the past.

00:22:57.170 --> 00:22:58.810 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, sure it's interesting.

00:22:58.810 --> 00:23:02.030 align:middle line:84%
You know, it's interesting to
look at ancient civilizations.

00:23:02.030 --> 00:23:04.850 align:middle line:84%
It's interesting to see what
people have done in the past.

00:23:04.850 --> 00:23:09.290 align:middle line:84%
For me as a scientist, the
value of looking into the past

00:23:09.290 --> 00:23:14.390 align:middle line:84%
is to recognize the patterns,
the trends, and the cycles

00:23:14.390 --> 00:23:16.670 align:middle line:84%
of those who have
come before us;

00:23:16.670 --> 00:23:20.340 align:middle line:84%
and to compare those to where
we are today and ask ourselves,

00:23:20.340 --> 00:23:22.700 align:middle line:90%
are we repeating those trends?

00:23:22.700 --> 00:23:24.320 align:middle line:90%
Are we repeating the patterns?

00:23:24.320 --> 00:23:26.030 align:middle line:90%
Are we repeating the cycles?

00:23:26.030 --> 00:23:28.740 align:middle line:84%
And it would make sense
if the answer is yes.

00:23:28.740 --> 00:23:31.670 align:middle line:84%
Now that we understand
the fractal code

00:23:31.670 --> 00:23:33.560 align:middle line:90%
and Newton's laws of energy.

00:23:33.560 --> 00:23:35.930 align:middle line:84%
Because the fractal
code says that we

00:23:35.930 --> 00:23:39.560 align:middle line:84%
will continue those patterns
until something-- something

00:23:39.560 --> 00:23:41.060 align:middle line:90%
in the variable changes.

00:23:41.060 --> 00:23:43.190 align:middle line:10%
And Newton's law
tells us that once

00:23:43.190 --> 00:23:46.190 align:middle line:10%
the energy is set into
motion that same energy is

00:23:46.190 --> 00:23:49.440 align:middle line:10%
going to continue until
something changes the energy.

00:23:49.440 --> 00:23:52.210 align:middle line:84%
So if there is a
thinking of conflict,

00:23:52.210 --> 00:23:57.150 align:middle line:84%
if there is a fear that there's
not enough, of scarcity,

00:23:57.150 --> 00:24:00.830 align:middle line:84%
if there is a fear of
the unknown, a fear

00:24:00.830 --> 00:24:03.920 align:middle line:84%
of other people, a fear of
what those people's lives mean

00:24:03.920 --> 00:24:07.430 align:middle line:84%
to us; and if that fear is
so ancient and so primal

00:24:07.430 --> 00:24:10.640 align:middle line:84%
that it is played out in every
civilization for the last 5,000

00:24:10.640 --> 00:24:13.340 align:middle line:84%
years and beyond,
then it makes sense

00:24:13.340 --> 00:24:15.590 align:middle line:84%
that this idea of
conflict and war

00:24:15.590 --> 00:24:19.920 align:middle line:84%
would be a primary reason for
us to be in this simulation.

00:24:19.920 --> 00:24:21.590 align:middle line:84%
And the archeology
supports this.

00:24:21.590 --> 00:24:25.610 align:middle line:84%
If Bostrom's mathematic
arguments are correct,

00:24:25.610 --> 00:24:29.690 align:middle line:84%
the fact that we're here today
asking these questions that's

00:24:29.690 --> 00:24:31.070 align:middle line:90%
good news.

00:24:31.070 --> 00:24:34.340 align:middle line:84%
Because it implies that we
have the wisdom to recognize

00:24:34.340 --> 00:24:36.950 align:middle line:84%
we're at a point where we
need to ask these questions.

00:24:36.950 --> 00:24:41.130 align:middle line:84%
It tells us there is a
need for this simulation.

00:24:41.130 --> 00:24:42.710 align:middle line:90%
So these are big ideas.

00:24:42.710 --> 00:24:43.910 align:middle line:90%
And I know they are.

00:24:43.910 --> 00:24:46.430 align:middle line:84%
And I'm bringing
them together now

00:24:46.430 --> 00:24:49.640 align:middle line:84%
at the close of this series,
because we have the vocabulary.

00:24:49.640 --> 00:24:53.610 align:middle line:84%
And we have a new context within
which to share these ideas.

00:24:53.610 --> 00:24:56.150 align:middle line:84%
So, what I'd like to do now
is give you a specific example

00:24:56.150 --> 00:24:59.660 align:middle line:84%
of what I'm talking about, this
pattern of conflict and whether

00:24:59.660 --> 00:25:01.020 align:middle line:90%
or not repeating the cycle.

00:25:01.020 --> 00:25:04.160 align:middle line:84%
So I'm going to use archeology,
contemporary archeology to do

00:25:04.160 --> 00:25:05.760 align:middle line:90%
this.

00:25:05.760 --> 00:25:07.400 align:middle line:84%
There was an
archaeological discovery

00:25:07.400 --> 00:25:11.450 align:middle line:84%
that was made mid-20th century,
a very mysterious, very

00:25:11.450 --> 00:25:12.410 align:middle line:90%
powerful discovery.

00:25:12.410 --> 00:25:14.440 align:middle line:90%
It's very controversial today.

00:25:14.440 --> 00:25:18.080 align:middle line:84%
And it is in the region
that is now called Pakistan.

00:25:18.080 --> 00:25:21.650 align:middle line:84%
It used to be India before
that the division happened,

00:25:21.650 --> 00:25:24.920 align:middle line:84%
and in the disputed areas
between India and Pakistan

00:25:24.920 --> 00:25:26.890 align:middle line:90%
in the Kashmir area.

00:25:26.890 --> 00:25:30.970 align:middle line:84%
There is evidence of an
advanced technological society

00:25:30.970 --> 00:25:33.660 align:middle line:84%
and advanced technological
civilization.

00:25:33.660 --> 00:25:35.575 align:middle line:84%
They had hot and
cold running water.

00:25:35.575 --> 00:25:37.160 align:middle line:90%
They had flush toilets.

00:25:37.160 --> 00:25:38.930 align:middle line:90%
They had stained glass windows.

00:25:38.930 --> 00:25:40.310 align:middle line:90%
They had advanced mathematics.

00:25:40.310 --> 00:25:43.310 align:middle line:84%
They had beautiful,
beautiful art.

00:25:43.310 --> 00:25:47.750 align:middle line:84%
And this advanced civilization
came to an abrupt end.

00:25:47.750 --> 00:25:51.020 align:middle line:84%
And we know that because
of what was left behind.

00:25:51.020 --> 00:25:54.260 align:middle line:84%
Now, when the
scientists began finding

00:25:54.260 --> 00:25:56.690 align:middle line:84%
this evidence of
this civilization,

00:25:56.690 --> 00:25:59.270 align:middle line:84%
one of the first
things that they found

00:25:59.270 --> 00:26:04.190 align:middle line:84%
were walls and floors that were
made of natural stone, granite,

00:26:04.190 --> 00:26:05.940 align:middle line:90%
for example.

00:26:05.940 --> 00:26:09.904 align:middle line:84%
But the term that was used
that the stones were vitrified.

00:26:09.904 --> 00:26:10.820 align:middle line:90%
Now, what this means--

00:26:10.820 --> 00:26:13.190 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to use granite
as an example-- granite

00:26:13.190 --> 00:26:17.060 align:middle line:84%
is made of three
minerals-- quartz, feldspar

00:26:17.060 --> 00:26:19.790 align:middle line:90%
which is a clay, and mica.

00:26:19.790 --> 00:26:23.460 align:middle line:84%
So, the quartz, the feldspar,
in the mica were in place.

00:26:23.460 --> 00:26:29.040 align:middle line:84%
However, the quartz in place
was melted within the stone.

00:26:29.040 --> 00:26:32.660 align:middle line:84%
Now, to melt the courts
in place requires

00:26:32.660 --> 00:26:35.870 align:middle line:84%
number one, a high amount
of heat to do the melting;

00:26:35.870 --> 00:26:39.050 align:middle line:84%
but number two, it
has to be very fast.

00:26:39.050 --> 00:26:42.020 align:middle line:84%
Because it didn't destroy
the floors and the walls.

00:26:42.020 --> 00:26:46.880 align:middle line:84%
So, it suggest a
rapid very high heat,

00:26:46.880 --> 00:26:49.490 align:middle line:84%
some point in our ancient
past that melted the quartz,

00:26:49.490 --> 00:26:50.940 align:middle line:90%
left everything in place.

00:26:50.940 --> 00:26:54.790 align:middle line:84%
They also found
mysterious little spheres,

00:26:54.790 --> 00:26:56.830 align:middle line:90%
little balls of clay.

00:26:56.830 --> 00:26:58.550 align:middle line:84%
They didn't know
what these were.

00:26:58.550 --> 00:27:00.200 align:middle line:84%
And when they
began to understand

00:27:00.200 --> 00:27:02.750 align:middle line:84%
that the walls and the
floors were vitrified

00:27:02.750 --> 00:27:06.740 align:middle line:84%
from a rapid intense heat, they
found that these little spheres

00:27:06.740 --> 00:27:11.600 align:middle line:84%
were clay vases that had
also been exposed to the heat

00:27:11.600 --> 00:27:14.630 align:middle line:90%
and were simply melted in place.

00:27:14.630 --> 00:27:16.960 align:middle line:84%
So, the scientists
are asking, what

00:27:16.960 --> 00:27:19.370 align:middle line:84%
is it that could
have possibly caused

00:27:19.370 --> 00:27:23.180 align:middle line:84%
this kind of intense
heat, intense enough

00:27:23.180 --> 00:27:26.690 align:middle line:84%
to melt the quartz, but so
fast that the walls were still

00:27:26.690 --> 00:27:28.190 align:middle line:90%
in place?

00:27:28.190 --> 00:27:29.960 align:middle line:84%
Well, some of the
human skeletons

00:27:29.960 --> 00:27:32.840 align:middle line:84%
that were discovered-- and
this is very controversial.

00:27:32.840 --> 00:27:36.410 align:middle line:84%
Some of the human skeletons
may give us a clue.

00:27:36.410 --> 00:27:41.360 align:middle line:84%
The skeletons were found
primarily in this location.

00:27:41.360 --> 00:27:46.190 align:middle line:84%
They were all at one end of
this ancient city in what

00:27:46.190 --> 00:27:48.440 align:middle line:90%
are called postures of flight.

00:27:48.440 --> 00:27:51.230 align:middle line:84%
And these are Russian
scientists in the mid-1960s

00:27:51.230 --> 00:27:55.340 align:middle line:84%
that were the first to find
this, postures of flight.

00:27:55.340 --> 00:27:56.580 align:middle line:90%
What does that mean?

00:27:56.580 --> 00:27:58.790 align:middle line:84%
It means they were running
away from something.

00:27:58.790 --> 00:28:04.380 align:middle line:84%
They were all at one end of
the city and they were running.

00:28:04.380 --> 00:28:07.490 align:middle line:10%
And the giveaway is that
some of the skeletons

00:28:07.490 --> 00:28:09.180 align:middle line:10%
were actually radioactive.

00:28:09.180 --> 00:28:10.850 align:middle line:84%
They were more
radioactive than you

00:28:10.850 --> 00:28:14.780 align:middle line:84%
would expect from the
normal background radiation

00:28:14.780 --> 00:28:17.940 align:middle line:84%
that we have from the
earth and from cosmic rays.

00:28:17.940 --> 00:28:19.850 align:middle line:90%
We're all absorbing radiation.

00:28:19.850 --> 00:28:22.370 align:middle line:84%
But the level in these
skeletons was higher

00:28:22.370 --> 00:28:24.105 align:middle line:90%
than it should have been.

00:28:24.105 --> 00:28:25.730 align:middle line:84%
So, the scientists
are looking at this.

00:28:25.730 --> 00:28:26.970 align:middle line:84%
They're putting
this all together

00:28:26.970 --> 00:28:29.095 align:middle line:84%
and they're saying, what
in the world could happen.

00:28:29.095 --> 00:28:30.920 align:middle line:84%
And this is one of
those places where

00:28:30.920 --> 00:28:33.950 align:middle line:84%
if you look at the
evidence itself,

00:28:33.950 --> 00:28:36.720 align:middle line:84%
you're never going
to solve the mystery.

00:28:36.720 --> 00:28:38.540 align:middle line:90%
We don't live in a vacuum.

00:28:38.540 --> 00:28:40.550 align:middle line:84%
History does not
occur in a vacuum.

00:28:40.550 --> 00:28:43.740 align:middle line:84%
And this is where
context is so important.

00:28:43.740 --> 00:28:45.670 align:middle line:84%
So, the evidence is
showing us a mystery.

00:28:45.670 --> 00:28:48.600 align:middle line:10%
However in that
part of the world,

00:28:48.600 --> 00:28:51.650 align:middle line:10%
the sacred text of
Mahabharata tells

00:28:51.650 --> 00:28:55.424 align:middle line:10%
a story that is believed
to have been a fairytale.

00:28:55.424 --> 00:28:57.590 align:middle line:84%
It is believed to have been
a fairytale because what

00:28:57.590 --> 00:29:01.460 align:middle line:84%
it describes is something
that is unfathomable up

00:29:01.460 --> 00:29:03.170 align:middle line:90%
until the 20th century.

00:29:03.170 --> 00:29:06.290 align:middle line:84%
What this text
describes makes no sense

00:29:06.290 --> 00:29:09.536 align:middle line:84%
until the technology of
the mid-20th century.

00:29:09.536 --> 00:29:10.910 align:middle line:84%
So, what I'd like
to do, I'd like

00:29:10.910 --> 00:29:13.670 align:middle line:84%
to read a portion of
an English translation

00:29:13.670 --> 00:29:15.980 align:middle line:90%
to you from this text.

00:29:15.980 --> 00:29:18.170 align:middle line:84%
And then let's take
this translation,

00:29:18.170 --> 00:29:20.360 align:middle line:84%
apply it to what has been
found archaeologically,

00:29:20.360 --> 00:29:22.610 align:middle line:84%
and see where that
leaves us in terms

00:29:22.610 --> 00:29:25.250 align:middle line:90%
of the cycles in our simulation.

00:29:25.250 --> 00:29:27.600 align:middle line:84%
So here are passages
from the text.

00:29:27.600 --> 00:29:32.150 align:middle line:84%
There were two armies
that were in a great war

00:29:32.150 --> 00:29:34.020 align:middle line:90%
at the end of a cycle.

00:29:34.020 --> 00:29:34.970 align:middle line:90%
All right.

00:29:34.970 --> 00:29:36.630 align:middle line:90%
The two armies were fighting.

00:29:36.630 --> 00:29:38.570 align:middle line:84%
And one of the
armies began to lose

00:29:38.570 --> 00:29:40.580 align:middle line:84%
and they resorted
to a weapon that

00:29:40.580 --> 00:29:42.320 align:middle line:90%
had never been used before.

00:29:42.320 --> 00:29:44.960 align:middle line:84%
And this is the way the
text describes the weapon.

00:29:44.960 --> 00:29:47.810 align:middle line:84%
It says "a single
projectile charged

00:29:47.810 --> 00:29:50.090 align:middle line:84%
with all the power
of the universe,

00:29:50.090 --> 00:29:53.780 align:middle line:84%
an incandescent column of
smoke and flame, as bright

00:29:53.780 --> 00:29:57.890 align:middle line:84%
as a thousand suns rose
in all of its splendor.

00:29:57.890 --> 00:30:02.360 align:middle line:84%
A perpendicular explosion with
the billowing smoke clouds.

00:30:02.360 --> 00:30:05.960 align:middle line:10%
The cloud of smoke rising
after the first explosion,

00:30:05.960 --> 00:30:09.140 align:middle line:10%
formed into expanding
circles like the opening

00:30:09.140 --> 00:30:10.010 align:middle line:10%
of a giant parasol."

00:30:10.010 --> 00:30:13.260 align:middle line:90%


00:30:13.260 --> 00:30:16.260 align:middle line:84%
"It was an unknown weapon,
an iron thunderbolt,

00:30:16.260 --> 00:30:18.890 align:middle line:84%
a gigantic messenger
of death which

00:30:18.890 --> 00:30:23.250 align:middle line:84%
reduced to ashes the entire race
of Vrishnis and the Andhakas.

00:30:23.250 --> 00:30:27.130 align:middle line:84%
The corpses were so burned
as to be unrecognizable.

00:30:27.130 --> 00:30:28.830 align:middle line:90%
The hair and the nails fell out.

00:30:28.830 --> 00:30:31.360 align:middle line:84%
Pottery broke without
apparent cause,

00:30:31.360 --> 00:30:33.600 align:middle line:90%
and the birds turned white.

00:30:33.600 --> 00:30:36.570 align:middle line:84%
After a few hours all
food stuffs were infected,

00:30:36.570 --> 00:30:38.790 align:middle line:84%
and to escape from
this fire, the soldiers

00:30:38.790 --> 00:30:40.710 align:middle line:84%
threw themselves
into the streams

00:30:40.710 --> 00:30:42.985 align:middle line:84%
to wash themselves
and their equipment."

00:30:42.985 --> 00:30:45.660 align:middle line:90%


00:30:45.660 --> 00:30:47.790 align:middle line:84%
So, the description
that you've just heard

00:30:47.790 --> 00:30:49.470 align:middle line:90%
is from an ancient text.

00:30:49.470 --> 00:30:53.130 align:middle line:84%
However what it
describes sounds very

00:30:53.130 --> 00:30:57.120 align:middle line:84%
much like a contemporary
description of the unthinkable,

00:30:57.120 --> 00:31:01.830 align:middle line:84%
of a nuclear explosion happening
some time in our ancient past.

00:31:01.830 --> 00:31:03.330 align:middle line:90%
Is it possible?

00:31:03.330 --> 00:31:06.510 align:middle line:84%
Is it possible that these
advanced civilizations

00:31:06.510 --> 00:31:09.480 align:middle line:84%
that we now know are cyclic
that have risen and fallen

00:31:09.480 --> 00:31:12.090 align:middle line:84%
in the past, that
had electricity, that

00:31:12.090 --> 00:31:14.430 align:middle line:84%
had hot and cold running
water, and flush toilets,

00:31:14.430 --> 00:31:16.500 align:middle line:84%
and stained glass
windows, and advanced

00:31:16.500 --> 00:31:21.570 align:middle line:84%
mathematics of the cosmos and
of nature itself; is it possible

00:31:21.570 --> 00:31:25.470 align:middle line:84%
that they began a path
that we are following now?

00:31:25.470 --> 00:31:28.170 align:middle line:84%
Are we the first atomic
civilization or has there

00:31:28.170 --> 00:31:30.090 align:middle line:90%
been one before us?

00:31:30.090 --> 00:31:33.000 align:middle line:10%
Well, the father of the
modern nuclear program,

00:31:33.000 --> 00:31:36.390 align:middle line:10%
Robert Oppenheimer, was
asked this very question.

00:31:36.390 --> 00:31:39.960 align:middle line:10%
In an interview that he was
doing at Rochester University

00:31:39.960 --> 00:31:41.670 align:middle line:10%
there was a student
that asked it,

00:31:41.670 --> 00:31:43.890 align:middle line:10%
and he said, Dr.
Oppenheimer, how

00:31:43.890 --> 00:31:46.290 align:middle line:84%
do you feel after
having exploded

00:31:46.290 --> 00:31:49.200 align:middle line:90%
the first atomic bomb on Earth?

00:31:49.200 --> 00:31:50.820 align:middle line:90%
And Oppenheimer replied.

00:31:50.820 --> 00:31:53.280 align:middle line:84%
And his reply
shocked the audience.

00:31:53.280 --> 00:31:56.400 align:middle line:84%
It shocked the person who
was asking a question.

00:31:56.400 --> 00:31:58.920 align:middle line:84%
Because Oppenheimer
said, well, he

00:31:58.920 --> 00:32:04.830 align:middle line:84%
said not the first atomic bomb,
but the first in modern times.

00:32:04.830 --> 00:32:08.010 align:middle line:84%
Robert Oppenheimer was a
student of the Mahabharata.

00:32:08.010 --> 00:32:11.820 align:middle line:84%
He was a student of the
Bhagavad Gita, the related text.

00:32:11.820 --> 00:32:15.370 align:middle line:84%
And he firmly believed
that we are, in fact,

00:32:15.370 --> 00:32:18.090 align:middle line:84%
a cyclic civilization
and that we are repeating

00:32:18.090 --> 00:32:20.220 align:middle line:90%
a pattern from the past.

00:32:20.220 --> 00:32:23.820 align:middle line:84%
And if we are within the
context of our simulation,

00:32:23.820 --> 00:32:28.770 align:middle line:84%
we have to ask, what are the
consequences of our simulation

00:32:28.770 --> 00:32:33.170 align:middle line:84%
if we were to engage in a
large-scale nuclear war?

00:32:33.170 --> 00:32:37.050 align:middle line:84%
Now, think about this in terms
of this entire conversation.

00:32:37.050 --> 00:32:40.650 align:middle line:84%
The release of energy
from a nuclear weapon

00:32:40.650 --> 00:32:44.790 align:middle line:84%
is information, tremendous
amounts of information.

00:32:44.790 --> 00:32:48.540 align:middle line:84%
How much information would
be released into the system

00:32:48.540 --> 00:32:53.310 align:middle line:84%
if we had multiple nuclear
explosions in a conflict,

00:32:53.310 --> 00:32:57.030 align:middle line:84%
like we've had perhaps in
the past on a limited scale?

00:32:57.030 --> 00:32:59.364 align:middle line:84%
How long could we
continue to produce

00:32:59.364 --> 00:33:00.780 align:middle line:84%
that kind of
information before we

00:33:00.780 --> 00:33:04.860 align:middle line:84%
reach that capacity, that limit
that we talked about earlier?

00:33:04.860 --> 00:33:07.320 align:middle line:84%
So, this whole idea
of the simulation

00:33:07.320 --> 00:33:11.310 align:middle line:84%
is giving us new ways to think
about us, about what we're

00:33:11.310 --> 00:33:13.190 align:middle line:84%
living, about what's
happening in our world

00:33:13.190 --> 00:33:15.210 align:middle line:84%
and what's happening
in our lives.

00:33:15.210 --> 00:33:17.700 align:middle line:84%
If the unthinkable has
happened in the past,

00:33:17.700 --> 00:33:20.160 align:middle line:84%
are we repeating that
cycle again in our lives?

00:33:20.160 --> 00:33:21.810 align:middle line:84%
And if we are, can
we recognize it?

00:33:21.810 --> 00:33:24.780 align:middle line:84%
Do we have the wisdom
to recognize it

00:33:24.780 --> 00:33:28.230 align:middle line:84%
and as Newton's law
says, shift the energy.

00:33:28.230 --> 00:33:29.700 align:middle line:90%
Move to a new course.

00:33:29.700 --> 00:33:32.580 align:middle line:84%
Plug in a new variable
into that fractal code,

00:33:32.580 --> 00:33:35.280 align:middle line:84%
so that we can
avoid the suffering

00:33:35.280 --> 00:33:38.910 align:middle line:84%
that obviously would
come from such a path.

00:33:38.910 --> 00:33:40.897 align:middle line:84%
The common thread that
runs through every one

00:33:40.897 --> 00:33:42.605 align:middle line:84%
of the possibilities
that I've described,

00:33:42.605 --> 00:33:44.396 align:middle line:84%
whether we're talking
about climate change,

00:33:44.396 --> 00:33:48.060 align:middle line:84%
or we're talking about
disease pandemics or war;

00:33:48.060 --> 00:33:51.900 align:middle line:84%
is that every one of
these possibilities

00:33:51.900 --> 00:33:54.150 align:middle line:90%
is related to human choice.

00:33:54.150 --> 00:33:58.020 align:middle line:84%
It's the choices that we
are making within our lives,

00:33:58.020 --> 00:34:01.680 align:middle line:84%
now within our simulation,
that are resulting

00:34:01.680 --> 00:34:05.340 align:middle line:84%
in the very conditions that
could end this experience based

00:34:05.340 --> 00:34:07.080 align:middle line:90%
upon the way we think.

00:34:07.080 --> 00:34:09.255 align:middle line:84%
Now, my sense,
personally; my sense

00:34:09.255 --> 00:34:13.530 align:middle line:84%
is because conflict has
played such a dominant role

00:34:13.530 --> 00:34:16.920 align:middle line:84%
throughout history and that
that theme is playing out today

00:34:16.920 --> 00:34:21.989 align:middle line:84%
and it appears to be coming to a
head, again and again this idea

00:34:21.989 --> 00:34:23.250 align:middle line:90%
keeps coming up.

00:34:23.250 --> 00:34:25.679 align:middle line:84%
My sense is that we are
learning to create a world where

00:34:25.679 --> 00:34:29.040 align:middle line:84%
war doesn't exist or
it's become obsolete.

00:34:29.040 --> 00:34:31.860 align:middle line:84%
And we're doing so by
developing the potential that

00:34:31.860 --> 00:34:33.989 align:middle line:84%
lives within each of
us as individuals.

00:34:33.989 --> 00:34:38.040 align:middle line:84%
And remember, the better we know
ourselves, the less we fear--

00:34:38.040 --> 00:34:43.960 align:middle line:84%
the less we fear one another and
the less we fear the unknown.

00:34:43.960 --> 00:34:45.449 align:middle line:84%
If we're honest
with ourselves, we

00:34:45.449 --> 00:34:47.314 align:middle line:90%
know that the world is changing.

00:34:47.314 --> 00:34:49.230 align:middle line:84%
And we also know that
the old ways of thinking

00:34:49.230 --> 00:34:52.080 align:middle line:84%
are failing when it comes
to solving the big problems

00:34:52.080 --> 00:34:54.449 align:middle line:90%
like climate change and war.

00:34:54.449 --> 00:34:57.660 align:middle line:84%
We need a new way to think about
our world and a new language

00:34:57.660 --> 00:34:59.460 align:middle line:90%
to solve our problems.

00:34:59.460 --> 00:35:02.220 align:middle line:84%
Simulation by design
is an invitation.

00:35:02.220 --> 00:35:04.980 align:middle line:84%
It invites us to think
differently about ourselves,

00:35:04.980 --> 00:35:07.530 align:middle line:84%
about yourself, and what you've
been taught when it comes

00:35:07.530 --> 00:35:09.780 align:middle line:90%
to our world and our past.

00:35:09.780 --> 00:35:13.670 align:middle line:84%
The science gives us rock solid
reasons to think differently.

00:35:13.670 --> 00:35:16.440 align:middle line:84%
But the events of
today's world tell us

00:35:16.440 --> 00:35:19.330 align:middle line:90%
that now is the time to do so.

00:35:19.330 --> 00:35:22.380 align:middle line:84%
So, as we begin to embrace the
possibility that we are living

00:35:22.380 --> 00:35:26.490 align:middle line:84%
in a simulated world, we also
unlock the deepest mysteries

00:35:26.490 --> 00:35:27.684 align:middle line:90%
of our existence.

00:35:27.684 --> 00:35:29.100 align:middle line:84%
At the same time
we're discovering

00:35:29.100 --> 00:35:32.010 align:middle line:84%
what it takes for us to become
the best people we can be

00:35:32.010 --> 00:35:34.540 align:middle line:84%
and to create the
best possible world.

00:35:34.540 --> 00:35:37.314 align:middle line:84%
I want to thank you for
joining me throughout this very

00:35:37.314 --> 00:35:38.980 align:middle line:84%
special presentation
of "Missing Links,"

00:35:38.980 --> 00:35:41.010 align:middle line:84%
and I hope you've
enjoyed watching it as

00:35:41.010 --> 00:35:43.050 align:middle line:90%
much as I enjoyed creating it.

00:35:43.050 --> 00:35:45.740 align:middle line:84%
And while we have reached
the end of this program,

00:35:45.740 --> 00:35:48.600 align:middle line:84%
I want you to know that there's
more, much, much more to come.

00:35:48.600 --> 00:35:51.080 align:middle line:84%
So, be sure to tune in
to the all-new "Missing

00:35:51.080 --> 00:35:53.840 align:middle line:84%
Links" for the discoveries
that reveal the deepest

00:35:53.840 --> 00:35:57.650 align:middle line:84%
truths of our origin, history,
our destiny, and our fate.

00:35:57.650 --> 00:35:59.720 align:middle line:84%
Until then, thank
you for watching.
