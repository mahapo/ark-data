00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:29.270 align:middle line:84%
>> New discoveries have
overturned 150 years

00:00:29.270 --> 00:00:32.830 align:middle line:84%
of scientific thinking when
it comes to us, to and me,

00:00:32.830 --> 00:00:35.870 align:middle line:84%
and the way we think about
ourselves, about one another,

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:40.340 align:middle line:84%
about the world, from
undeniable evidence of advanced

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:41.180 align:middle line:90%
civilizations.

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:43.054 align:middle line:84%
They're now dating back
into the last Ice Age

00:00:43.054 --> 00:00:45.260 align:middle line:84%
and even before to
the way we think

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:47.810 align:middle line:84%
about other people and their
cultures, their religions,

00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:49.880 align:middle line:84%
their beliefs, and
even the way we

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:52.590 align:middle line:90%
view disease and immortality.

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:56.060 align:middle line:84%
There is a new story
that's emerging.

00:00:56.060 --> 00:00:57.260 align:middle line:90%
My name's Gregg Braden.

00:00:57.260 --> 00:01:00.560 align:middle line:84%
And I'd like to welcome you to
this very special presentation

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:03.890 align:middle line:84%
of "Missing Links: The Deep
Truth of Our Origin, History,

00:01:03.890 --> 00:01:06.920 align:middle line:90%
Destiny, and Fate."

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:08.920 align:middle line:90%
So here's my question to you.

00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:11.920 align:middle line:84%
How can we be resilient
in a world that's growing

00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:13.600 align:middle line:90%
more volatile by the day?

00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:16.330 align:middle line:84%
How can we thrive in
the new normal that's

00:01:16.330 --> 00:01:18.400 align:middle line:84%
already with us,
it's already here,

00:01:18.400 --> 00:01:22.030 align:middle line:84%
unless we're honest with
ourselves about that story

00:01:22.030 --> 00:01:23.770 align:middle line:90%
and what it's showing us?

00:01:23.770 --> 00:01:26.800 align:middle line:84%
"Missing Links: is all
about the new discoveries.

00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:28.450 align:middle line:10%
Discoveries that
you're just not seeing

00:01:28.450 --> 00:01:32.000 align:middle line:10%
in traditional mainstream media,
textbooks, and classrooms.

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:33.580 align:middle line:84%
What those discoveries
are telling us

00:01:33.580 --> 00:01:36.220 align:middle line:84%
and what they mean
in our lives, what's

00:01:36.220 --> 00:01:38.530 align:middle line:84%
causing these
extremes in our world?

00:01:38.530 --> 00:01:40.540 align:middle line:84%
Why are they
happening right now?

00:01:40.540 --> 00:01:44.170 align:middle line:84%
Well, it's all about
cycles, cycles of time.

00:01:44.170 --> 00:01:48.520 align:middle line:84%
Scientists now recognize that we
are living the rare convergence

00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:52.900 align:middle line:84%
of three massive cycles of
change-- cycles of, climate

00:01:52.900 --> 00:01:57.430 align:middle line:84%
economic cycles, and
cycles of human conflict.

00:01:57.430 --> 00:01:59.950 align:middle line:84%
And I want you to know
these are natural cycles

00:01:59.950 --> 00:02:02.290 align:middle line:84%
and they follow natural
rhythms that we can know,

00:02:02.290 --> 00:02:04.570 align:middle line:84%
we can predict, and
we can calculate.

00:02:04.570 --> 00:02:07.600 align:middle line:84%
And they appear on
a regular basis.

00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:09.669 align:middle line:84%
And that's what makes
today so different.

00:02:09.669 --> 00:02:12.580 align:middle line:84%
All three of these cycles are
appearing at the same time.

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:14.350 align:middle line:90%
They're colliding right now.

00:02:14.350 --> 00:02:17.980 align:middle line:84%
And it's happening
in our lifetime.

00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:20.530 align:middle line:84%
The primary source
of information

00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:23.740 align:middle line:84%
about the history of our
planet comes from the sea floor

00:02:23.740 --> 00:02:25.750 align:middle line:84%
sediments in the core
samples that scientists

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:27.340 align:middle line:90%
pull up out of the oceans.

00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:30.360 align:middle line:84%
It comes from the
ancient tree ring data.

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:32.110 align:middle line:84%
The problem is the
tree rings only go back

00:02:32.110 --> 00:02:34.000 align:middle line:90%
a couple of thousand years.

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:36.040 align:middle line:84%
And it comes from
the ice cores that we

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:39.670 align:middle line:84%
find in the ice sheets of
Antarctica and Greenland.

00:02:39.670 --> 00:02:43.810 align:middle line:84%
So I'd like to zero in on
those ice cores a little bit.

00:02:43.810 --> 00:02:47.860 align:middle line:10%
From the ice cores, tremendous
amounts of information

00:02:47.860 --> 00:02:50.440 align:middle line:10%
can be detailed
by scientists who

00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:52.870 align:middle line:10%
know how to read these
ice cores like we

00:02:52.870 --> 00:02:55.180 align:middle line:10%
read the pages of a book.

00:02:55.180 --> 00:02:58.750 align:middle line:84%
Each year, when that new
layer of ice is deposited,

00:02:58.750 --> 00:03:00.820 align:middle line:84%
that layer captures
the information

00:03:00.820 --> 00:03:03.160 align:middle line:84%
of whatever was happening
in the atmosphere.

00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:04.630 align:middle line:84%
If there was a
volcanic eruption,

00:03:04.630 --> 00:03:06.340 align:middle line:84%
we've got volcanic
dust particles.

00:03:06.340 --> 00:03:10.390 align:middle line:84%
If the wind has blown pollen
grains into Antarctica

00:03:10.390 --> 00:03:12.770 align:middle line:90%
from Europe, then we know that.

00:03:12.770 --> 00:03:16.000 align:middle line:84%
In the ice cores we can tell how
strong the magnetic fields have

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:17.590 align:middle line:84%
been the past, how
strong the sun is,

00:03:17.590 --> 00:03:19.600 align:middle line:84%
tremendous amount
of information,

00:03:19.600 --> 00:03:21.340 align:middle line:90%
how high the sea levels were.

00:03:21.340 --> 00:03:22.420 align:middle line:90%
Here's the key.

00:03:22.420 --> 00:03:27.060 align:middle line:10%
We can tell what the
temperatures were, as well.

00:03:27.060 --> 00:03:30.330 align:middle line:10%
What we're seeing now
is the information

00:03:30.330 --> 00:03:35.970 align:middle line:10%
going back over 420,000 years
into the history of the Earth.

00:03:35.970 --> 00:03:41.280 align:middle line:84%
1999, scientists,
international scientists,

00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:45.930 align:middle line:84%
recognized that global warming
was actually melting the ice

00:03:45.930 --> 00:03:48.690 align:middle line:84%
and destroying this
library, this record that we

00:03:48.690 --> 00:03:49.490 align:middle line:90%
have in Antarctica.

00:03:49.490 --> 00:03:52.140 align:middle line:84%
And they said even though we
don't know why the warming is

00:03:52.140 --> 00:03:55.980 align:middle line:84%
happening, let's drill through
the thickest part of the ice

00:03:55.980 --> 00:03:58.620 align:middle line:84%
and we'll capture as
much data as we can.

00:03:58.620 --> 00:04:01.480 align:middle line:84%
Then we can go back and figure
out what's causing the warming.

00:04:01.480 --> 00:04:03.240 align:middle line:10%
Well even the scientists
were absolutely

00:04:03.240 --> 00:04:06.300 align:middle line:10%
amazed because when they
pulled that ice core up,

00:04:06.300 --> 00:04:09.300 align:middle line:10%
from an area that is called
Vostok Lake in the very

00:04:09.300 --> 00:04:12.120 align:middle line:10%
famous Vostok ice
core, they pulled up

00:04:12.120 --> 00:04:16.440 align:middle line:10%
over 420,000 layers of ice.

00:04:16.440 --> 00:04:19.290 align:middle line:84%
Each layer represents one
year of the earth's history.

00:04:19.290 --> 00:04:23.670 align:middle line:10%
So all of a sudden, we've
got 420,000 years of our past

00:04:23.670 --> 00:04:26.280 align:middle line:10%
to compare to today to
see if something's wrong,

00:04:26.280 --> 00:04:29.610 align:middle line:10%
to see if Earth is broken, to
see if there's something truly

00:04:29.610 --> 00:04:32.360 align:middle line:10%
anomalous happening right now.

00:04:32.360 --> 00:04:34.850 align:middle line:10%
You're seeing two
different ice cores.

00:04:34.850 --> 00:04:39.350 align:middle line:84%
In blue is the EPICA ice
core from another location

00:04:39.350 --> 00:04:43.617 align:middle line:84%
in Antarctica. $ And the
green is the Vostok ice core.

00:04:43.617 --> 00:04:45.950 align:middle line:84%
And what I'd like to call
your attention to-- just right

00:04:45.950 --> 00:04:47.780 align:middle line:84%
off even if you know
nothing about how

00:04:47.780 --> 00:04:50.450 align:middle line:84%
to read this information--
you can see the cycles.

00:04:50.450 --> 00:04:52.100 align:middle line:90%
You can see the rhythms.

00:04:52.100 --> 00:04:53.750 align:middle line:10%
And it's not your imagination.

00:04:53.750 --> 00:04:57.200 align:middle line:10%
There are nested cycles,
cycles within cycles.

00:04:57.200 --> 00:04:58.850 align:middle line:10%
There are 100,000 year cycles.

00:04:58.850 --> 00:05:00.350 align:middle line:10%
There are 41,000 year cycles.

00:05:00.350 --> 00:05:01.970 align:middle line:10%
There are 26,000 year cycles.

00:05:01.970 --> 00:05:05.630 align:middle line:10%
There are even 5,000
year long cycles.

00:05:05.630 --> 00:05:08.690 align:middle line:10%
So the way that we
can read this graph,

00:05:08.690 --> 00:05:13.230 align:middle line:10%
the 420,000 years begins on the
right hand side of this screen.

00:05:13.230 --> 00:05:16.850 align:middle line:10%
We're present day on
the left at year zero.

00:05:16.850 --> 00:05:20.750 align:middle line:10%
And if you look at either the
blue or the green ice cores,

00:05:20.750 --> 00:05:24.067 align:middle line:10%
what you can see is they tend
to agree with one another.

00:05:24.067 --> 00:05:26.150 align:middle line:10%
There are times when the
temperatures of the earth

00:05:26.150 --> 00:05:28.460 align:middle line:10%
have ebbed and flowed,
when it's been warmer

00:05:28.460 --> 00:05:31.250 align:middle line:10%
and when it's been cooler, and
when it happens in one place,

00:05:31.250 --> 00:05:33.380 align:middle line:10%
it happens in another
place as well.

00:05:33.380 --> 00:05:35.870 align:middle line:10%
The red that you're seeing
at the bottom of the graph

00:05:35.870 --> 00:05:38.780 align:middle line:10%
is the thickness of the
ice as it correlates

00:05:38.780 --> 00:05:40.710 align:middle line:10%
to those temperatures.

00:05:40.710 --> 00:05:45.050 align:middle line:10%
So what is obvious when we look
at this graph is that if you

00:05:45.050 --> 00:05:48.200 align:middle line:10%
look at year zero, today,
we are a little bit

00:05:48.200 --> 00:05:50.660 align:middle line:10%
above the average
temperature for what

00:05:50.660 --> 00:05:51.890 align:middle line:10%
you would expect Earth to be.

00:05:51.890 --> 00:05:54.950 align:middle line:10%
I would expect to see some
global warming right now.

00:05:54.950 --> 00:05:57.260 align:middle line:84%
I'd be concerned if we
didn't, because that is

00:05:57.260 --> 00:05:59.000 align:middle line:90%
what has happened in the past.

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:02.450 align:middle line:84%
The question is how
much warming is normal?

00:06:02.450 --> 00:06:05.080 align:middle line:84%
How much warming should
we really be seeing?

00:06:05.080 --> 00:06:07.640 align:middle line:84%
Well the next graph that
I'd like for you to see

00:06:07.640 --> 00:06:11.490 align:middle line:84%
is a graph that also comes from
the ice core data and the sea

00:06:11.490 --> 00:06:12.800 align:middle line:90%
floor sediment data.

00:06:12.800 --> 00:06:15.530 align:middle line:10%
However, it does not
contain the tree ring data.

00:06:15.530 --> 00:06:18.830 align:middle line:10%
And it's telling us something
really, really interesting.

00:06:18.830 --> 00:06:22.640 align:middle line:10%
This graph begins
at year zero-- we

00:06:22.640 --> 00:06:24.740 align:middle line:10%
would say-- at the
time of Jesus--

00:06:24.740 --> 00:06:28.430 align:middle line:10%
just for point of reference--
and goes for 2,000 years

00:06:28.430 --> 00:06:30.350 align:middle line:10%
into the year 2000.

00:06:30.350 --> 00:06:32.300 align:middle line:84%
The green line
that you're seeing

00:06:32.300 --> 00:06:36.650 align:middle line:84%
in the middle of this chart
is the average temperature

00:06:36.650 --> 00:06:39.680 align:middle line:84%
for the Earth over
these 2,000 years.

00:06:39.680 --> 00:06:42.140 align:middle line:84%
And the chart, the
graph, is showing us

00:06:42.140 --> 00:06:45.530 align:middle line:84%
above and below that
average where we have seen

00:06:45.530 --> 00:06:47.030 align:middle line:90%
the temperatures in the past.

00:06:47.030 --> 00:06:47.510 align:middle line:90%
So it's obvious.

00:06:47.510 --> 00:06:49.343 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes the temperatures
are above normal.

00:06:49.343 --> 00:06:50.870 align:middle line:90%
Sometimes they're below normal.

00:06:50.870 --> 00:06:52.390 align:middle line:84%
Here's why this
is so interesting.

00:06:52.390 --> 00:06:56.100 align:middle line:10%
If you look closely, where we
are today, are we above normal?

00:06:56.100 --> 00:06:56.900 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

00:06:56.900 --> 00:06:59.660 align:middle line:84%
We're above the average
normal for where

00:06:59.660 --> 00:07:01.700 align:middle line:90%
Earth has been in the past.

00:07:01.700 --> 00:07:04.220 align:middle line:84%
Are we warmer now than
we have ever been?

00:07:04.220 --> 00:07:05.540 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely not.

00:07:05.540 --> 00:07:06.530 align:middle line:90%
Look at this.

00:07:06.530 --> 00:07:10.940 align:middle line:10%
If you go back into the
years 1200-1300 in what

00:07:10.940 --> 00:07:13.010 align:middle line:10%
is called Common
Era, CE, they're

00:07:13.010 --> 00:07:17.990 align:middle line:10%
using this notation now
instead of AD and BC

00:07:17.990 --> 00:07:19.700 align:middle line:10%
to remove any
religious implications.

00:07:19.700 --> 00:07:23.480 align:middle line:84%
So when I say CE, it means
Common Era from the year zero

00:07:23.480 --> 00:07:24.500 align:middle line:90%
to now.

00:07:24.500 --> 00:07:28.130 align:middle line:84%
1200-1300 Common
Era, the temperatures

00:07:28.130 --> 00:07:31.120 align:middle line:84%
were almost twice as warm
as they are right now,

00:07:31.120 --> 00:07:33.770 align:middle line:84%
twice the anomaly that
we're seeing right now.

00:07:33.770 --> 00:07:37.220 align:middle line:84%
And if you go back into the
years 820-1040 Common Era,

00:07:37.220 --> 00:07:38.210 align:middle line:90%
look at this.

00:07:38.210 --> 00:07:42.320 align:middle line:84%
Three times above where
the anomaly is right now.

00:07:42.320 --> 00:07:44.780 align:middle line:84%
And scientists know
this because they

00:07:44.780 --> 00:07:49.520 align:middle line:84%
have a name they give to
this period it's called MWP.

00:07:49.520 --> 00:07:53.370 align:middle line:10%
It means the Medieval
Warming Period.

00:07:53.370 --> 00:07:55.520 align:middle line:10%
So the point of me
sharing this with you

00:07:55.520 --> 00:07:57.950 align:middle line:10%
is to show that the
warming does happen.

00:07:57.950 --> 00:08:00.920 align:middle line:84%
And I would expect that we
would be in a warming cycle now.

00:08:00.920 --> 00:08:03.430 align:middle line:84%
And that the warming is not
the warmest it's ever been.

00:08:03.430 --> 00:08:06.650 align:middle line:84%
And if you look closely, the
warming, when it happens,

00:08:06.650 --> 00:08:09.360 align:middle line:90%
it's brief, it's intense.

00:08:09.360 --> 00:08:11.360 align:middle line:84%
And it's what comes right
after the warming that

00:08:11.360 --> 00:08:12.630 align:middle line:90%
sometimes can be the problem.

00:08:12.630 --> 00:08:14.840 align:middle line:10%
It's the cooling that follows.

00:08:14.840 --> 00:08:17.000 align:middle line:10%
This is a very,
very powerful graph.

00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:18.830 align:middle line:10%
And I'm going to walk
through it slowly

00:08:18.830 --> 00:08:22.355 align:middle line:10%
so you can see exactly what
Mother Earth is telling us.

00:08:22.355 --> 00:08:25.940 align:middle line:84%
And that is the value of
looking at the information

00:08:25.940 --> 00:08:27.650 align:middle line:90%
from the Earth herself.

00:08:27.650 --> 00:08:29.240 align:middle line:84%
We're not seeing
this interpreted

00:08:29.240 --> 00:08:31.280 align:middle line:84%
through the eyes
of a corporation

00:08:31.280 --> 00:08:33.590 align:middle line:84%
or of a political
or religious agenda.

00:08:33.590 --> 00:08:36.770 align:middle line:84%
This is the Earth
telling us her story.

00:08:36.770 --> 00:08:39.230 align:middle line:90%
And this story is fascinating.

00:08:39.230 --> 00:08:40.820 align:middle line:10%
In this particular
graph, the year

00:08:40.820 --> 00:08:43.100 align:middle line:10%
zero-- to the right hand
side of the screen-- that's

00:08:43.100 --> 00:08:44.870 align:middle line:10%
us, that's where we are today.

00:08:44.870 --> 00:08:48.530 align:middle line:10%
I'm going to go back
to the 420,000 years

00:08:48.530 --> 00:08:52.390 align:middle line:10%
from where the ice cores
were in the previous graphs.

00:08:52.390 --> 00:08:54.080 align:middle line:10%
And if you'll notice,
you're looking

00:08:54.080 --> 00:08:56.900 align:middle line:10%
at two colors, red and blue.

00:08:56.900 --> 00:08:59.930 align:middle line:10%
The red are the
temperatures of the earth,

00:08:59.930 --> 00:09:01.460 align:middle line:10%
the average temperatures.

00:09:01.460 --> 00:09:05.600 align:middle line:10%
And the blue are the levels of
greenhouse gases, particularly

00:09:05.600 --> 00:09:06.990 align:middle line:10%
carbon dioxide.

00:09:06.990 --> 00:09:09.320 align:middle line:10%
And I'm showing
this because we're

00:09:09.320 --> 00:09:13.110 align:middle line:10%
being told that it is the carbon
dioxide in the greenhouse gases

00:09:13.110 --> 00:09:16.370 align:middle line:10%
that is causing the temperatures
of the earth to rise

00:09:16.370 --> 00:09:18.260 align:middle line:10%
and causing the concern.

00:09:18.260 --> 00:09:22.320 align:middle line:84%
The data in this graph
doesn't support that theory.

00:09:22.320 --> 00:09:25.160 align:middle line:84%
And I want you to see
precisely how this works.

00:09:25.160 --> 00:09:26.270 align:middle line:10%
So follow with me.

00:09:26.270 --> 00:09:29.030 align:middle line:10%
If we're moving
from that 400,000

00:09:29.030 --> 00:09:31.310 align:middle line:10%
years toward the
present, so we're

00:09:31.310 --> 00:09:35.000 align:middle line:10%
moving from the left to the
right hand side of the graph.

00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:40.410 align:middle line:10%
What you see is that the red
lines rise before the blue.

00:09:40.410 --> 00:09:44.690 align:middle line:10%
That means the temperature is
rising before the greenhouse

00:09:44.690 --> 00:09:46.040 align:middle line:10%
gases.

00:09:46.040 --> 00:09:48.740 align:middle line:84%
And this is what's recorded
in the ice cores in Antarctica

00:09:48.740 --> 00:09:50.000 align:middle line:90%
and in Greenland.

00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:52.970 align:middle line:84%
The temperatures
rise first and then

00:09:52.970 --> 00:09:56.210 align:middle line:84%
the greenhouse gases, the
carbon dioxide, follow.

00:09:56.210 --> 00:09:57.850 align:middle line:90%
And there is a lag time.

00:09:57.850 --> 00:09:59.170 align:middle line:90%
And it's not our imagination.

00:09:59.170 --> 00:10:01.674 align:middle line:84%
This is from peer
reviewed science.

00:10:01.674 --> 00:10:03.090 align:middle line:10%
This is peer
reviewed science that

00:10:03.090 --> 00:10:06.830 align:middle line:10%
was published in the very
prestigious journal "Nature"

00:10:06.830 --> 00:10:10.180 align:middle line:10%
volume 329 in the year 1987.

00:10:10.180 --> 00:10:15.160 align:middle line:84%
Scientists knew this
as far back as 1987.

00:10:15.160 --> 00:10:18.560 align:middle line:84%
So I'm going to zero in on
what it is that they said.

00:10:18.560 --> 00:10:19.690 align:middle line:90%
And this is their language.

00:10:19.690 --> 00:10:21.910 align:middle line:10%
They said "when we
are going from what's

00:10:21.910 --> 00:10:24.004 align:middle line:10%
called an interglacial
condition--"

00:10:24.004 --> 00:10:25.420 align:middle line:10%
and that's where
we are right now.

00:10:25.420 --> 00:10:29.020 align:middle line:10%
We're not in the glaciers,
we're in between the time

00:10:29.020 --> 00:10:30.940 align:middle line:10%
when the glaciers appear.

00:10:30.940 --> 00:10:33.540 align:middle line:10%
So "when we're going
from interglacial

00:10:33.540 --> 00:10:38.040 align:middle line:10%
into a glacial condition--" into
a time when the earth cools--

00:10:38.040 --> 00:10:40.630 align:middle line:10%
"the change in the
carbon dioxide actually

00:10:40.630 --> 00:10:43.100 align:middle line:10%
lags the change in
the air temperature."

00:10:43.100 --> 00:10:43.900 align:middle line:90%
It lags.

00:10:43.900 --> 00:10:47.410 align:middle line:84%
And that lag time is usually
400, to 500, 600, 700, maybe

00:10:47.410 --> 00:10:48.280 align:middle line:90%
800 years.

00:10:48.280 --> 00:10:50.050 align:middle line:90%
So there is that lag time.

00:10:50.050 --> 00:10:52.720 align:middle line:84%
So this is from peer
reviewed science

00:10:52.720 --> 00:10:54.110 align:middle line:90%
in the journal "Nature."

00:10:54.110 --> 00:10:54.987 align:middle line:90%
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:10:54.987 --> 00:10:56.820 align:middle line:10%
- Here's an example of
a core that goes back

00:10:56.820 --> 00:11:01.390 align:middle line:10%
some 100,000 to 200,000 years.

00:11:01.390 --> 00:11:05.170 align:middle line:84%
And the sediments within
this show clear differences,

00:11:05.170 --> 00:11:09.920 align:middle line:84%
visually, which have been caused
by different seasons climate.

00:11:09.920 --> 00:11:13.900 align:middle line:84%
And you can see here a whiter
carbonate ooze and here

00:11:13.900 --> 00:11:16.861 align:middle line:90%
a red brown clay.

00:11:16.861 --> 00:11:18.910 align:middle line:84%
These carbonate oozes
meant is laid down

00:11:18.910 --> 00:11:22.360 align:middle line:84%
during interglacial
periods, warmer periods.

00:11:22.360 --> 00:11:24.280 align:middle line:84%
And these red clays
have been laid down

00:11:24.280 --> 00:11:26.807 align:middle line:84%
during the glacial
period, cooler periods.

00:11:26.807 --> 00:11:28.030 align:middle line:90%
[END PLAYBACK]

00:11:28.030 --> 00:11:31.060 align:middle line:84%
>> Now I want to go back and
take a closer look at this

00:11:31.060 --> 00:11:35.410 align:middle line:84%
chart because it's telling us
even something more profound.

00:11:35.410 --> 00:11:40.240 align:middle line:10%
If you look closely, when
the carbon dioxide levels

00:11:40.240 --> 00:11:45.340 align:middle line:10%
do increase when they go up,
the temperatures actually drop.

00:11:45.340 --> 00:11:47.720 align:middle line:84%
The stronger the
carbon dioxide levels,

00:11:47.720 --> 00:11:51.010 align:middle line:84%
the cooler the temperatures
on the Earth become.

00:11:51.010 --> 00:11:52.790 align:middle line:90%
Now why is that important?

00:11:52.790 --> 00:11:55.420 align:middle line:84%
Because it is a
fact we have thrown

00:11:55.420 --> 00:11:59.750 align:middle line:84%
tremendous amounts of carbon
dioxide into the atmosphere.

00:11:59.750 --> 00:12:02.980 align:middle line:84%
We have now created more
of a carbon dioxide burden

00:12:02.980 --> 00:12:04.690 align:middle line:84%
in the Earth's
atmosphere than we

00:12:04.690 --> 00:12:07.480 align:middle line:84%
have in the 420,000 years
that we have the history for.

00:12:07.480 --> 00:12:11.060 align:middle line:84%
We've never seen this much
CO2 in the atmosphere.

00:12:11.060 --> 00:12:14.800 align:middle line:84%
So if in the past,
higher levels of CO2

00:12:14.800 --> 00:12:17.560 align:middle line:84%
have created a cooling
effect with the levels

00:12:17.560 --> 00:12:19.720 align:middle line:84%
that were there
then, it makes sense

00:12:19.720 --> 00:12:23.050 align:middle line:84%
that we can expect a greater
degree of cooling because

00:12:23.050 --> 00:12:25.300 align:middle line:90%
of the higher degrees of CO2.

00:12:25.300 --> 00:12:26.630 align:middle line:90%
Why is that important?

00:12:26.630 --> 00:12:29.950 align:middle line:84%
Well a lot of that cooling
happens north of the equator.

00:12:29.950 --> 00:12:33.910 align:middle line:84%
The bulk of the earth's landmass
is north of the equator.

00:12:33.910 --> 00:12:35.890 align:middle line:84%
The bulk of the
world's population

00:12:35.890 --> 00:12:37.230 align:middle line:90%
is north of the equator.

00:12:37.230 --> 00:12:39.620 align:middle line:84%
And most of our food is
grown north of the equator.

00:12:39.620 --> 00:12:42.820 align:middle line:84%
So when we see a
change in climate,

00:12:42.820 --> 00:12:44.530 align:middle line:84%
when we see a cooling--
and that doesn't

00:12:44.530 --> 00:12:47.050 align:middle line:84%
mean that we're moving
into another Ice Age--

00:12:47.050 --> 00:12:50.260 align:middle line:84%
but even a little cooling
changes the conditions

00:12:50.260 --> 00:12:52.990 align:middle line:84%
that allow us to grow the food
and support the industries

00:12:52.990 --> 00:12:53.830 align:middle line:90%
that we depend upon.

00:12:53.830 --> 00:12:55.390 align:middle line:90%
So this is important.

00:12:55.390 --> 00:12:57.310 align:middle line:84%
And I think it is
important for us

00:12:57.310 --> 00:13:01.270 align:middle line:84%
to be honest, truthful,
and factual with ourselves.

00:13:01.270 --> 00:13:03.280 align:middle line:84%
I asked earlier in
the program how can we

00:13:03.280 --> 00:13:07.090 align:middle line:84%
be resilient to the extreme if
we're not honest with ourselves

00:13:07.090 --> 00:13:07.930 align:middle line:90%
about the extreme?

00:13:07.930 --> 00:13:11.870 align:middle line:84%
And this is a perfect example
of exactly what I mean here.

00:13:11.870 --> 00:13:14.770 align:middle line:84%
So the question that
obviously comes up

00:13:14.770 --> 00:13:18.790 align:middle line:84%
is if the carbon dioxide
is not causing the changes

00:13:18.790 --> 00:13:20.950 align:middle line:84%
in the climate, as
we have been led

00:13:20.950 --> 00:13:23.680 align:middle line:84%
to believe-- as many scientists
believe right now-- then what

00:13:23.680 --> 00:13:24.520 align:middle line:90%
is?

00:13:24.520 --> 00:13:27.160 align:middle line:84%
So this is the key
climate change is a fact,

00:13:27.160 --> 00:13:28.350 align:middle line:90%
it's happening.

00:13:28.350 --> 00:13:30.730 align:middle line:84%
But it may not be
happening for the reasons

00:13:30.730 --> 00:13:32.440 align:middle line:90%
that we have suspected.

00:13:32.440 --> 00:13:36.220 align:middle line:84%
So what we're now beginning
to understand parallels,

00:13:36.220 --> 00:13:39.430 align:middle line:84%
in many cases, what our
most ancient and indigenous

00:13:39.430 --> 00:13:41.460 align:middle line:90%
traditions have always told us.

00:13:41.460 --> 00:13:45.730 align:middle line:10%
If you go to the Inuit
elders in the Arctic regions

00:13:45.730 --> 00:13:49.210 align:middle line:10%
and you ask them what it is
that's causing this change,

00:13:49.210 --> 00:13:50.650 align:middle line:10%
they will tell you.

00:13:50.650 --> 00:13:52.810 align:middle line:84%
They will tell you
that the Earth has

00:13:52.810 --> 00:13:56.470 align:middle line:90%
changed her location in space.

00:13:56.470 --> 00:13:59.257 align:middle line:84%
They'll say that
their sky has changed.

00:13:59.257 --> 00:14:00.340 align:middle line:90%
This is the term they use.

00:14:00.340 --> 00:14:02.660 align:middle line:90%
Their sky has changed.

00:14:02.660 --> 00:14:06.520 align:middle line:84%
Well there was an
Australian astronomer.

00:14:06.520 --> 00:14:10.510 align:middle line:10%
His name is Milutin Milankovic
who agrees with this.

00:14:10.510 --> 00:14:14.770 align:middle line:10%
Before he died in 1958,
Milutin Milankovic

00:14:14.770 --> 00:14:18.540 align:middle line:10%
had created a theory that
was discounted at first,

00:14:18.540 --> 00:14:20.680 align:middle line:10%
but it is becoming
more popular now

00:14:20.680 --> 00:14:23.140 align:middle line:10%
because it is telling
us the story that

00:14:23.140 --> 00:14:26.500 align:middle line:10%
matches the data of what
we're actually saying.

00:14:26.500 --> 00:14:31.690 align:middle line:84%
Milutin Milankovic
recognized three big cycles,

00:14:31.690 --> 00:14:35.500 align:middle line:84%
shifts in the location,
of Earth in space.

00:14:35.500 --> 00:14:38.680 align:middle line:84%
Earth, it doesn't stay
stationary as Earth moves

00:14:38.680 --> 00:14:41.260 align:middle line:84%
around the sun, our
planet does a dance.

00:14:41.260 --> 00:14:43.150 align:middle line:84%
There's a tilt, an
angle, and a wobble.

00:14:43.150 --> 00:14:44.400 align:middle line:90%
And they have technical terms.

00:14:44.400 --> 00:14:47.170 align:middle line:84%
And let me just identify
those very quickly.

00:14:47.170 --> 00:14:50.980 align:middle line:84%
One of those is called the
precession of the equinoxes.

00:14:50.980 --> 00:14:55.180 align:middle line:84%
We all heard about precession
during the 2012 phenomenon

00:14:55.180 --> 00:14:56.860 align:middle line:90%
in the Mayan calendar.

00:14:56.860 --> 00:15:00.360 align:middle line:84%
Precessions are about
26,000 years long.

00:15:00.360 --> 00:15:01.930 align:middle line:90%
And our ancestors knew that.

00:15:01.930 --> 00:15:03.310 align:middle line:90%
So that is one of the cycles.

00:15:03.310 --> 00:15:07.470 align:middle line:84%
A second cycle is what
is called eccentricity.

00:15:07.470 --> 00:15:11.880 align:middle line:84%
And what that means is that
as earth moves around the sun,

00:15:11.880 --> 00:15:15.060 align:middle line:84%
it's not a circular orbit,
it is an elliptical orbit.

00:15:15.060 --> 00:15:17.790 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes in the ellipse,
we're closer to the sun.

00:15:17.790 --> 00:15:19.660 align:middle line:90%
Sometimes we're further away.

00:15:19.660 --> 00:15:21.930 align:middle line:84%
That means the cycle
varies when we're close,

00:15:21.930 --> 00:15:23.880 align:middle line:84%
about 41,000 years,
and we're further

00:15:23.880 --> 00:15:27.030 align:middle line:90%
apart about 100,000 years.

00:15:27.030 --> 00:15:28.560 align:middle line:90%
That's the second cycle.

00:15:28.560 --> 00:15:32.770 align:middle line:84%
And the third is called
the tilt, or the obliquity.

00:15:32.770 --> 00:15:33.570 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:15:33.570 --> 00:15:38.310 align:middle line:84%
So these three cycles that
Earth is going through

00:15:38.310 --> 00:15:40.750 align:middle line:84%
as it moves around the sun,
now you know what they are.

00:15:40.750 --> 00:15:44.020 align:middle line:84%
Let's take a look at them as
they are plotted on a graph.

00:15:44.020 --> 00:15:47.080 align:middle line:84%
You're going to see something
absolutely astounding.

00:15:47.080 --> 00:15:51.120 align:middle line:84%
So what you're seeing in the
graph on your screen right now,

00:15:51.120 --> 00:15:53.520 align:middle line:84%
the red is the precession
of the equinoxes.

00:15:53.520 --> 00:15:55.860 align:middle line:90%
The green is the obliquity.

00:15:55.860 --> 00:15:58.690 align:middle line:84%
And the blue is
the eccentricity.

00:15:58.690 --> 00:16:03.220 align:middle line:84%
Now, if you look closely
as they ebb and flow,

00:16:03.220 --> 00:16:09.610 align:middle line:84%
if either eccentricity or
obliquity or precession,

00:16:09.610 --> 00:16:12.890 align:middle line:84%
if any two of these
rise at the same time,

00:16:12.890 --> 00:16:14.070 align:middle line:90%
look at what happens.

00:16:14.070 --> 00:16:15.790 align:middle line:10%
At the bottom of
the screen, you're

00:16:15.790 --> 00:16:19.090 align:middle line:10%
seeing warming and
cooling of the Earth.

00:16:19.090 --> 00:16:22.000 align:middle line:10%
And you can see that when
eccentricity, for example,

00:16:22.000 --> 00:16:25.000 align:middle line:10%
and obliquity, when
those coincide,

00:16:25.000 --> 00:16:26.965 align:middle line:10%
we have a warming
period on the Earth.

00:16:26.965 --> 00:16:28.840 align:middle line:10%
I'm showing you this on
the screen right now.

00:16:28.840 --> 00:16:30.631 align:middle line:10%
And you say, well,
maybe that's an anomaly.

00:16:30.631 --> 00:16:32.325 align:middle line:10%
Maybe it's just that one time.

00:16:32.325 --> 00:16:33.125 align:middle line:10%
But look at this.

00:16:33.125 --> 00:16:35.400 align:middle line:10%
If we go back and
look at each of these.

00:16:35.400 --> 00:16:38.750 align:middle line:10%
Here we're seeing
eccentricity as a peak

00:16:38.750 --> 00:16:40.570 align:middle line:10%
and we're also seeing
obliquity as a peak

00:16:40.570 --> 00:16:41.740 align:middle line:10%
in the blue and the green.

00:16:41.740 --> 00:16:42.760 align:middle line:10%
and right below that.

00:16:42.760 --> 00:16:46.290 align:middle line:10%
Every place where that happened,
we saw warming in our planet.

00:16:46.290 --> 00:16:48.640 align:middle line:10%
And it happens all the time.

00:16:48.640 --> 00:16:52.570 align:middle line:10%
So the reason this is important
is because we are here

00:16:52.570 --> 00:16:54.580 align:middle line:10%
at the far left of the screen.

00:16:54.580 --> 00:16:56.980 align:middle line:10%
Where that red
line is, that's us.

00:16:56.980 --> 00:16:59.890 align:middle line:10%
And we're having a little
bump in eccentricity.

00:16:59.890 --> 00:17:02.650 align:middle line:10%
We're seeing that coincide
with the obliquity.

00:17:02.650 --> 00:17:05.410 align:middle line:84%
So we're seeing this
dance the Earth is

00:17:05.410 --> 00:17:08.319 align:middle line:84%
doing in a very precise
way that has created

00:17:08.319 --> 00:17:10.960 align:middle line:84%
warming in the past, and it's
doing the same thing right now.

00:17:10.960 --> 00:17:12.849 align:middle line:84%
I would expect to
see some warming.

00:17:12.849 --> 00:17:16.210 align:middle line:84%
And we are seeing a
relatively small warming

00:17:16.210 --> 00:17:18.770 align:middle line:84%
compared to what we
have seen in the past.

00:17:18.770 --> 00:17:21.760 align:middle line:84%
So this is one of
the cycles, climate.

00:17:21.760 --> 00:17:25.359 align:middle line:84%
And I mentioned there are three
cycles that are converging.

00:17:25.359 --> 00:17:29.377 align:middle line:84%
I spent a little bit
more time on this portion

00:17:29.377 --> 00:17:31.210 align:middle line:84%
because we're hearing
so much about climate.

00:17:31.210 --> 00:17:32.709 align:middle line:84%
And I think it's
important to really

00:17:32.709 --> 00:17:34.151 align:middle line:84%
understand throughout
this series,

00:17:34.151 --> 00:17:35.650 align:middle line:84%
throughout "Missing
Links" I'm going

00:17:35.650 --> 00:17:39.010 align:middle line:84%
to refer back to the
extremes that are

00:17:39.010 --> 00:17:41.140 align:middle line:90%
being caused by these cycles.

00:17:41.140 --> 00:17:43.750 align:middle line:84%
The second cycle that
I'd like to talk to you

00:17:43.750 --> 00:17:47.182 align:middle line:90%
about is the cycle of economies.

00:17:47.182 --> 00:17:48.640 align:middle line:84%
And when I talk
about economies, it

00:17:48.640 --> 00:17:49.750 align:middle line:90%
doesn't have to be about money.

00:17:49.750 --> 00:17:50.720 align:middle line:90%
It can be.

00:17:50.720 --> 00:17:53.470 align:middle line:84%
The economies are about
people, about the way

00:17:53.470 --> 00:17:56.440 align:middle line:84%
we work together and share
the vital resources that we

00:17:56.440 --> 00:17:59.040 align:middle line:90%
need-- food, water, medicine.

00:17:59.040 --> 00:18:02.870 align:middle line:10%
Well there was an economist
early in the 20th century.

00:18:02.870 --> 00:18:07.270 align:middle line:10%
His name was Nikolai
Kondratiev, Nikolai Kondratiev.

00:18:07.270 --> 00:18:12.760 align:middle line:10%
And he was the first to
recognize the rhythm of cycles

00:18:12.760 --> 00:18:15.820 align:middle line:10%
as it plays out in global
and local economies.

00:18:15.820 --> 00:18:18.460 align:middle line:84%
Whether we're talking the
small scale of a family,

00:18:18.460 --> 00:18:20.540 align:middle line:84%
or a large scale the
community, or a planet,

00:18:20.540 --> 00:18:21.790 align:middle line:90%
it seems to be the same thing.

00:18:21.790 --> 00:18:26.320 align:middle line:84%
And what he did is he identified
a 66-year economic cycle.

00:18:26.320 --> 00:18:28.375 align:middle line:84%
And he broke this
cycle into seasons.

00:18:28.375 --> 00:18:30.560 align:middle line:90%
And I find this fascinating.

00:18:30.560 --> 00:18:35.470 align:middle line:84%
Our 66-year cycle, that we're
in right now began in 1949.

00:18:35.470 --> 00:18:39.550 align:middle line:10%
That was what he called the
Spring of this economic cycle.

00:18:39.550 --> 00:18:46.840 align:middle line:10%
And it lasted from 1949
until the year 1966.

00:18:46.840 --> 00:18:48.550 align:middle line:10%
This was a time of inflation.

00:18:48.550 --> 00:18:51.010 align:middle line:10%
It was a beginning of
an inflationary cycle.

00:18:51.010 --> 00:18:52.630 align:middle line:10%
And in inflation,
as we all know,

00:18:52.630 --> 00:18:55.300 align:middle line:10%
there are certain stocks,
certain commodities,

00:18:55.300 --> 00:18:59.200 align:middle line:10%
certain bonds, that that
tend to do better or worse

00:18:59.200 --> 00:19:01.930 align:middle line:10%
depending on where
we are in this cycle.

00:19:01.930 --> 00:19:04.480 align:middle line:10%
In the inflationary
cycle, what we see is

00:19:04.480 --> 00:19:07.690 align:middle line:10%
there are certain assets that
tend to do better in the Spring

00:19:07.690 --> 00:19:09.460 align:middle line:10%
than they do in other times.

00:19:09.460 --> 00:19:12.520 align:middle line:84%
But the Spring only
lasted until 1966.

00:19:12.520 --> 00:19:16.660 align:middle line:10%
From 1966 until
the year 1980, we

00:19:16.660 --> 00:19:20.020 align:middle line:10%
were in the Summer of
this economic cycle.

00:19:20.020 --> 00:19:21.970 align:middle line:90%
And I remember this personally.

00:19:21.970 --> 00:19:26.680 align:middle line:84%
I was in school and I was
working in the 1960s, 1970s.

00:19:26.680 --> 00:19:29.290 align:middle line:84%
I remember when I could
deposit my paycheck in the bank

00:19:29.290 --> 00:19:33.040 align:middle line:84%
and I could get 16, 17,
18% interest on my money

00:19:33.040 --> 00:19:38.020 align:middle line:84%
because we were in an economic
cycle of this inflation.

00:19:38.020 --> 00:19:39.710 align:middle line:90%
It was called runaway inflation.

00:19:39.710 --> 00:19:40.510 align:middle line:90%
It was good for me.

00:19:40.510 --> 00:19:42.700 align:middle line:10%
It helped me to
save for college.

00:19:42.700 --> 00:19:45.730 align:middle line:10%
so that's something we may
not see again for a while.

00:19:45.730 --> 00:19:51.220 align:middle line:10%
So from 1980, we went into a
new economic cycle, the Autumn,

00:19:51.220 --> 00:19:54.250 align:middle line:10%
that lasts until the year 2000.

00:19:54.250 --> 00:19:55.720 align:middle line:10%
And in this cycle,
as the others,

00:19:55.720 --> 00:19:57.880 align:middle line:10%
there are certain investments.

00:19:57.880 --> 00:20:00.670 align:middle line:10%
There are certain
tangible assets

00:20:00.670 --> 00:20:02.200 align:middle line:10%
that seem to do
better in this cycle

00:20:02.200 --> 00:20:04.990 align:middle line:10%
than they do in
others until we enter

00:20:04.990 --> 00:20:07.240 align:middle line:10%
into the next
phase of the cycle.

00:20:07.240 --> 00:20:12.100 align:middle line:10%
In the year 2000, we went into
the Winter of the 66-year cycle

00:20:12.100 --> 00:20:13.100 align:middle line:10%
that we're in right now.

00:20:13.100 --> 00:20:16.730 align:middle line:10%
A period that is
less popularly known.

00:20:16.730 --> 00:20:20.380 align:middle line:10%
It's called dis-inflation
or deflation,

00:20:20.380 --> 00:20:23.620 align:middle line:10%
when the things that used to
have value begin to lose value.

00:20:23.620 --> 00:20:24.860 align:middle line:90%
Property loses value.

00:20:24.860 --> 00:20:27.200 align:middle line:84%
Precious metals
lose their value.

00:20:27.200 --> 00:20:30.160 align:middle line:10%
It's a very, very different
way of thinking about money

00:20:30.160 --> 00:20:31.330 align:middle line:10%
and about economies.

00:20:31.330 --> 00:20:35.680 align:middle line:10%
And that lasted
until the year 2015.

00:20:35.680 --> 00:20:39.250 align:middle line:10%
In 2015, according
to Kondratiev,

00:20:39.250 --> 00:20:42.970 align:middle line:10%
we now have entered into
a new economic cycle.

00:20:42.970 --> 00:20:46.600 align:middle line:10%
And we are beginning the
inflationary cycle once again.

00:20:46.600 --> 00:20:49.180 align:middle line:10%
And I think we're seeing this
as the Federal Reserve is

00:20:49.180 --> 00:20:52.350 align:middle line:10%
beginning to raise the interest
rates to create the inflation.

00:20:52.350 --> 00:20:54.100 align:middle line:10%
And we're seeing this
happen in the world.

00:20:54.100 --> 00:21:05.529 align:middle line:10%

wrong, good, or bad.

00:21:25.980 --> 00:21:29.670 align:middle line:84%
It is a period of time where
things change and the way

00:21:29.670 --> 00:21:31.660 align:middle line:90%
we think about things changes.

00:21:31.660 --> 00:21:34.980 align:middle line:10%
If you don't know that and
you see the economy making

00:21:34.980 --> 00:21:37.380 align:middle line:10%
wild swings, you think
something is wrong

00:21:37.380 --> 00:21:39.570 align:middle line:10%
and something's broken,
when actually we're

00:21:39.570 --> 00:21:43.579 align:middle line:10%
in a very volatile time
with this particular cycle.

00:21:43.579 --> 00:21:45.120 align:middle line:84%
Now, I mentioned
three cycles and I'm

00:21:45.120 --> 00:21:48.090 align:middle line:84%
going to talk about the
third one right now.

00:21:48.090 --> 00:21:52.140 align:middle line:84%
This cycle is a cycle that is
a little mysterious to people

00:21:52.140 --> 00:21:55.680 align:middle line:84%
because it is the cycle
of human conflict.

00:21:55.680 --> 00:21:58.239 align:middle line:84%
People say to me, what do
you mean a cycle of conflict?

00:21:58.239 --> 00:22:00.030 align:middle line:84%
Doesn't it just happen
whenever it happens?

00:22:00.030 --> 00:22:02.070 align:middle line:90%
Well the answer is no.

00:22:02.070 --> 00:22:03.630 align:middle line:90%
There is a rhythm.

00:22:03.630 --> 00:22:09.750 align:middle line:84%
There are cycles of conditions
that make us more vulnerable

00:22:09.750 --> 00:22:12.140 align:middle line:84%
and make us more
susceptible to conflict.

00:22:43.730 --> 00:22:47.730 align:middle line:84%
or find cooperation whether it's
with our families, our friends,

00:22:47.730 --> 00:22:50.270 align:middle line:84%
our communities or
between nations.

00:22:50.270 --> 00:22:53.000 align:middle line:84%
I recently had the opportunity
to speak at the United Nations

00:22:53.000 --> 00:22:56.180 align:middle line:84%
with a dear friend and colleague
of mine, Dr. Bruce Lipton.

00:22:56.180 --> 00:22:58.820 align:middle line:84%
And we were invited
to share with the UN

00:22:58.820 --> 00:23:02.690 align:middle line:84%
our perspective of cycles
of time, what we as a world

00:23:02.690 --> 00:23:04.900 align:middle line:84%
can expect so that
we can prepare,

00:23:04.900 --> 00:23:08.150 align:middle line:84%
know where to put our resources,
know where to put our energy.

00:23:08.150 --> 00:23:09.960 align:middle line:84%
And I'm sharing with
you precisely what

00:23:09.960 --> 00:23:10.760 align:middle line:90%
I shared with them.

00:23:10.760 --> 00:23:13.040 align:middle line:84%
The fact that we are living
this rare convergence

00:23:13.040 --> 00:23:14.330 align:middle line:90%
of these cycles.

00:23:14.330 --> 00:23:17.030 align:middle line:84%
And the economic cycles,
and the climate cycles,

00:23:17.030 --> 00:23:19.700 align:middle line:84%
many of those people
were not familiar with.

00:23:19.700 --> 00:23:21.770 align:middle line:84%
So the value of
knowing this that we

00:23:21.770 --> 00:23:26.480 align:middle line:84%
are in this cycle
of human conflict

00:23:26.480 --> 00:23:29.690 align:middle line:84%
when it's so easy
to be misunderstood

00:23:29.690 --> 00:23:32.600 align:middle line:84%
and to trigger an incident
that can wreak havoc

00:23:32.600 --> 00:23:34.410 align:middle line:90%
on entire nations.

00:23:34.410 --> 00:23:38.450 align:middle line:84%
The value of that is it
arms us with the wisdom

00:23:38.450 --> 00:23:41.510 align:middle line:84%
and the knowledge to
be very, very conscious

00:23:41.510 --> 00:23:44.750 align:middle line:84%
about our agreements,
about our communications.

00:23:44.750 --> 00:23:47.390 align:middle line:84%
You're actually
seeing the rhythm

00:23:47.390 --> 00:23:49.757 align:middle line:84%
of some of these conflict
cycles-- the beginning

00:23:49.757 --> 00:23:52.090 align:middle line:84%
and the end of the Korean
War, the beginning and the end

00:23:52.090 --> 00:23:54.860 align:middle line:90%
of World War I, World War II.

00:23:54.860 --> 00:23:57.530 align:middle line:84%
All of these pegged right
at the top and the bottom

00:23:57.530 --> 00:23:59.580 align:middle line:90%
of those cycles of conflict.

00:23:59.580 --> 00:24:02.300 align:middle line:84%
Well, what's interesting
is where are we

00:24:02.300 --> 00:24:03.560 align:middle line:90%
in these cycles right now?

00:24:03.560 --> 00:24:07.160 align:middle line:84%
In the year 2014,
we began an uptick

00:24:07.160 --> 00:24:09.980 align:middle line:90%
toward greater human conflict.

00:24:09.980 --> 00:24:13.190 align:middle line:84%
And that uptick peaks
in the year 2020.

00:24:13.190 --> 00:24:15.950 align:middle line:84%
So I would expect
between 2014 and 2020,

00:24:15.950 --> 00:24:17.750 align:middle line:84%
we would see a lot of
tension in the world.

00:24:17.750 --> 00:24:20.330 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't mean
we must have war,

00:24:20.330 --> 00:24:22.850 align:middle line:84%
it means we are vulnerable
and susceptible.

00:24:22.850 --> 00:24:26.030 align:middle line:84%
And it also means there's a
greater opportunity for deeper

00:24:26.030 --> 00:24:29.930 align:middle line:84%
communication to create peace in
the time of that vulnerability.

00:24:29.930 --> 00:24:32.280 align:middle line:90%
That's the good news.

00:24:32.280 --> 00:24:34.880 align:middle line:10%
So when I talk to people
about these conflict cycles,

00:24:34.880 --> 00:24:37.130 align:middle line:10%
they say what is it
that could possibly

00:24:37.130 --> 00:24:39.620 align:middle line:10%
be driving these cycles?

00:24:39.620 --> 00:24:42.025 align:middle line:84%
Well this is where it
goes back to Mother Earth.

00:24:42.025 --> 00:24:44.400 align:middle line:84%
I want to share something
quickly, I won't dwell on this,

00:24:44.400 --> 00:24:46.070 align:middle line:84%
but I want you to
see, so that you

00:24:46.070 --> 00:24:51.170 align:middle line:84%
can see how deeply connected
we are to our planet.

00:24:51.170 --> 00:24:53.870 align:middle line:84%
A lot of research
has been done now

00:24:53.870 --> 00:24:57.290 align:middle line:84%
relating human conflict
and social change

00:24:57.290 --> 00:24:59.990 align:middle line:90%
to the sun and solar cycles.

00:24:59.990 --> 00:25:04.680 align:middle line:84%
As far back as the 1700s,
1750 to the year 1920,

00:25:04.680 --> 00:25:07.460 align:middle line:84%
scientists had the
data where they

00:25:07.460 --> 00:25:09.890 align:middle line:84%
saw the ebb and the
flow of solar cycles

00:25:09.890 --> 00:25:13.160 align:middle line:84%
for the first time, they
could actually plot those out.

00:25:13.160 --> 00:25:15.980 align:middle line:84%
Some very far
reaching scientists

00:25:15.980 --> 00:25:19.950 align:middle line:84%
looked at human achievements
and human disasters

00:25:19.950 --> 00:25:20.750 align:middle line:90%
at the same time.

00:25:20.750 --> 00:25:24.786 align:middle line:84%
They said what are people doing
while these solar cycles are

00:25:24.786 --> 00:25:26.160 align:middle line:84%
ebbing and while
they're flowing?

00:25:26.160 --> 00:25:27.710 align:middle line:84%
And this isn't all
about bad things.

00:25:27.710 --> 00:25:30.290 align:middle line:84%
It's about innovation and
creativity, new inventions,

00:25:30.290 --> 00:25:34.400 align:middle line:84%
the automobile, and
the way that we're

00:25:34.400 --> 00:25:37.550 align:middle line:84%
using electronics today,
and all of these things.

00:25:37.550 --> 00:25:41.150 align:middle line:84%
The ideas of physics, Einstein,
Niels Bohr, Max Planck,

00:25:41.150 --> 00:25:43.040 align:middle line:90%
all of these ideas, Edison.

00:25:43.040 --> 00:25:45.500 align:middle line:84%
This is all happening
linked to the ebb

00:25:45.500 --> 00:25:47.150 align:middle line:90%
and flow of these cycles.

00:25:47.150 --> 00:25:50.150 align:middle line:84%
So what you're seeing on your
screen is a very rare image.

00:25:50.150 --> 00:25:53.780 align:middle line:10%
It is the image showing the
solar cycles ebbing and flowing

00:25:53.780 --> 00:25:56.120 align:middle line:10%
from 1750 to 1920.

00:25:56.120 --> 00:26:01.280 align:middle line:10%
And the blue line above
that is the human activity

00:26:01.280 --> 00:26:03.560 align:middle line:10%
all combined--
innovations and war.

00:26:03.560 --> 00:26:07.460 align:middle line:84%
Big stuff happens when the
solar cycles increase and we

00:26:07.460 --> 00:26:10.240 align:middle line:84%
seem to quiet down when
the solar cycles decrease.

00:26:10.240 --> 00:26:12.792 align:middle line:84%
Well that leads to the
question, this ends in 1920.

00:26:12.792 --> 00:26:13.750 align:middle line:90%
Where are we right now?

00:26:13.750 --> 00:26:16.700 align:middle line:84%
That was my question
as I was seeing this.

00:26:16.700 --> 00:26:18.000 align:middle line:90%
So I put this together.

00:26:18.000 --> 00:26:21.770 align:middle line:84%
So you can see precisely
what it is that's happening.

00:26:21.770 --> 00:26:25.340 align:middle line:84%
Now what you see is
that Solar Cycle 22,

00:26:25.340 --> 00:26:27.050 align:middle line:84%
right in the middle
of that cycle,

00:26:27.050 --> 00:26:31.370 align:middle line:84%
the peak, that was when we
had the Iraq Kuwaiti War,

00:26:31.370 --> 00:26:32.990 align:middle line:90%
a huge example of conflict.

00:26:32.990 --> 00:26:36.560 align:middle line:84%
Solar Cycle 23 was 9/11,
right in the middle.

00:26:36.560 --> 00:26:39.830 align:middle line:84%
And Solar Cycle
24, the first week

00:26:39.830 --> 00:26:44.030 align:middle line:84%
that the sun spots, that the
magnetic storms on the sun

00:26:44.030 --> 00:26:46.610 align:middle line:84%
began to increase,
that was when we

00:26:46.610 --> 00:26:49.100 align:middle line:84%
had what was called the Arab
Spring in places like Egypt

00:26:49.100 --> 00:26:51.920 align:middle line:84%
and Tunisia and
Libya, all of these

00:26:51.920 --> 00:26:53.810 align:middle line:90%
linked to the solar cycles.

00:26:53.810 --> 00:26:55.640 align:middle line:84%
So once again,
scientists are not

00:26:55.640 --> 00:26:59.240 align:middle line:84%
saying that the sun is
causing these effects.

00:26:59.240 --> 00:27:00.920 align:middle line:84%
What we're seeing
is that there are

00:27:00.920 --> 00:27:06.500 align:middle line:84%
natural conditions that create
the environment that we respond

00:27:06.500 --> 00:27:07.370 align:middle line:90%
to.

00:27:07.370 --> 00:27:10.460 align:middle line:84%
And that environment,
in that environment,

00:27:10.460 --> 00:27:13.970 align:middle line:84%
we are sometimes more
aggressive and sometimes

00:27:13.970 --> 00:27:15.400 align:middle line:90%
more willing to cooperate.

00:27:15.400 --> 00:27:17.650 align:middle line:84%
And that's going to be
important later in this series.

00:27:17.650 --> 00:27:19.880 align:middle line:84%
I'm wanting you to see it right
now so that we can refer back

00:27:19.880 --> 00:27:20.780 align:middle line:90%
to this.

00:27:20.780 --> 00:27:24.260 align:middle line:84%
So we are now in
the Solar Cycle 24.

00:27:24.260 --> 00:27:27.560 align:middle line:84%
What does all this
mean to us right now?

00:27:27.560 --> 00:27:32.330 align:middle line:84%
Well if we understand how
these cycles come together,

00:27:32.330 --> 00:27:36.950 align:middle line:84%
what we know is that nature--
nature-- uses the extremes

00:27:36.950 --> 00:27:39.980 align:middle line:84%
that we're seeing as a
trigger for new ideas

00:27:39.980 --> 00:27:42.020 align:middle line:90%
and new solutions.

00:27:42.020 --> 00:27:45.350 align:middle line:84%
I mentioned that we are
living in a time of extremes.

00:27:45.350 --> 00:27:48.020 align:middle line:84%
And I wanted to
share with you what

00:27:48.020 --> 00:27:50.390 align:middle line:84%
it is that's causing
extremes, the convergence

00:27:50.390 --> 00:27:51.800 align:middle line:90%
of these cycles.

00:27:51.800 --> 00:27:53.810 align:middle line:84%
So I think it's fair
to say to you now

00:27:53.810 --> 00:27:56.690 align:middle line:84%
the best minds of our time are
saying we are, in fact, living

00:27:56.690 --> 00:27:57.540 align:middle line:90%
a time of extremes.

00:27:57.540 --> 00:28:00.123 align:middle line:10%
It doesn't mean bad things are
happening, or even good things,

00:28:00.123 --> 00:28:03.260 align:middle line:10%
but big things, big, big,
changes in the world.

00:28:03.260 --> 00:28:06.890 align:middle line:84%
Our world is changing
in ways that we simply

00:28:06.890 --> 00:28:08.960 align:middle line:90%
have not been prepared for.

00:28:08.960 --> 00:28:11.600 align:middle line:84%
And I think it's fair
to say, for most of us,

00:28:11.600 --> 00:28:14.120 align:middle line:84%
that those changes
are happening faster

00:28:14.120 --> 00:28:15.716 align:middle line:90%
than we have come to expect.

00:28:15.716 --> 00:28:17.090 align:middle line:84%
And what that
means is that we've

00:28:17.090 --> 00:28:19.010 align:middle line:84%
got to think and
live differently,

00:28:19.010 --> 00:28:22.340 align:middle line:84%
perhaps more so now than
we ever have in the past.

00:28:22.340 --> 00:28:24.380 align:middle line:84%
So I began this episode
saying that we're

00:28:24.380 --> 00:28:25.940 align:middle line:90%
living a time of extremes.

00:28:25.940 --> 00:28:28.936 align:middle line:84%
And now we've backed up that
statement with the specifics.

00:28:28.936 --> 00:28:31.227 align:middle line:84%
You now understand the extremes
and what's causing them

00:28:31.227 --> 00:28:33.410 align:middle line:90%
and what they mean in your life.

00:28:33.410 --> 00:28:35.480 align:middle line:84%
In our next episode,
we'll discover

00:28:35.480 --> 00:28:38.060 align:middle line:84%
how our time of
extremes has already

00:28:38.060 --> 00:28:41.390 align:middle line:84%
led to new thinking and
beautiful new solutions

00:28:41.390 --> 00:28:44.870 align:middle line:84%
when it comes to solving the
big, big problems in the world.

00:28:44.870 --> 00:28:47.120 align:middle line:84%
So I want to thank you for
joining me for this program

00:28:47.120 --> 00:28:49.580 align:middle line:84%
today and be sure to
tune in for our next

00:28:49.580 --> 00:28:52.070 align:middle line:84%
all new episode of
"Missing Links: The Deep

00:28:52.070 --> 00:28:56.050 align:middle line:84%
Truth of Our Origin,
History, Destiny, and Faith."

00:28:56.050 --> 00:29:10.101 align:middle line:90%
