00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:12.740 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:12.740 --> 00:00:24.510 align:middle line:90%


00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:25.310 align:middle line:90%
>> Hello.

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:26.330 align:middle line:10%
My name's Gregg Braden.

00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:29.090 align:middle line:10%
And I'd like to welcome you
to this all-new presentation

00:00:29.090 --> 00:00:30.800 align:middle line:10%
of "The Divine Matrix--

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:34.250 align:middle line:10%
Bridging Time, Space,
Miracles and Belief."

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:37.010 align:middle line:10%
In the last episode,
we saw how the language

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:39.410 align:middle line:10%
that we use in our
lives is related

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:41.300 align:middle line:10%
to the growth of
the neurons that

00:00:41.300 --> 00:00:43.820 align:middle line:10%
determine what we
think, the way we think,

00:00:43.820 --> 00:00:46.110 align:middle line:10%
and how we relate to the matrix.

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:48.530 align:middle line:84%
Well, in this episode, we're
going to go one step further.

00:00:48.530 --> 00:00:51.950 align:middle line:84%
We'll explore the physics of
our relationship to the matrix

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:55.940 align:middle line:84%
and how that language opens the
door to our greatest potentials

00:00:55.940 --> 00:00:57.990 align:middle line:84%
and the greatest
possibilities of our lives.

00:00:57.990 --> 00:01:01.070 align:middle line:90%


00:01:01.070 --> 00:01:04.099 align:middle line:84%
A new physics is emerging to
reflect the new discoveries

00:01:04.099 --> 00:01:05.880 align:middle line:90%
regarding the divine matrix.

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:08.540 align:middle line:84%
And we need a new physics,
because the conventional

00:01:08.540 --> 00:01:11.480 align:middle line:84%
physics of the past
simply cannot explain what

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:14.660 align:middle line:84%
the experiments are showing us
and what we now know to be true

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:16.050 align:middle line:90%
about the universe.

00:01:16.050 --> 00:01:19.310 align:middle line:84%
For example, we discovered
in previous episodes

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:22.730 align:middle line:84%
conventional physics tells
us that only about 4%

00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:26.130 align:middle line:84%
of the universe is made of
what we call physical matter.

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:28.110 align:middle line:84%
Well, from a
scientific perspective,

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:32.190 align:middle line:84%
that means that 96% of the
universe is unaccounted for.

00:01:32.190 --> 00:01:34.550 align:middle line:84%
And because it is
unaccounted for,

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:36.620 align:middle line:90%
scientists say it is missing.

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:39.560 align:middle line:84%
They actually say 96% of
the universe is missing.

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:42.590 align:middle line:84%
Entire reports have been
written and magazine covers

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:48.010 align:middle line:84%
created saying just that-- that
96% of the universe is missing.

00:01:48.010 --> 00:01:49.970 align:middle line:84%
Well, based upon the
new physics and what

00:01:49.970 --> 00:01:52.700 align:middle line:84%
it's telling us about the
atom, these statistics

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:54.290 align:middle line:84%
shouldn't be all
that surprising.

00:01:54.290 --> 00:01:58.420 align:middle line:84%
In just a few short decades,
our view of physical matter

00:01:58.420 --> 00:02:00.020 align:middle line:84%
shifted from
thinking of the atom,

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:04.880 align:middle line:84%
for example, as a discrete
thing of electrons and protons

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:08.389 align:middle line:84%
and neutrons that look like a
tiny solar system with planets

00:02:08.389 --> 00:02:09.850 align:middle line:90%
orbiting a sun.

00:02:09.850 --> 00:02:12.770 align:middle line:84%
Well, we've gone from
that view to a new view

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:16.040 align:middle line:84%
of pulsing fields of
energy where electrons

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:19.910 align:middle line:84%
are places of probabilities,
rather than things

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:21.455 align:middle line:90%
in space and time.

00:02:21.455 --> 00:02:24.800 align:middle line:84%
Well, it's this shift that's led
to the acceptance of the idea

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:31.320 align:middle line:84%
that the atom itself is
about 99.999999999% percent

00:02:31.320 --> 00:02:32.120 align:middle line:90%
empty space.

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:34.622 align:middle line:90%


00:02:34.622 --> 00:02:36.330 align:middle line:84%
But from the recent
discoveries that I've

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:38.490 align:middle line:84%
shared with you in
this series, you and I

00:02:38.490 --> 00:02:40.090 align:middle line:84%
both know that is
simply not true.

00:02:40.090 --> 00:02:42.480 align:middle line:90%
There is no empty space.

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:44.410 align:middle line:90%
Nature doesn't like empty.

00:02:44.410 --> 00:02:48.360 align:middle line:84%
So what appears as
the empty is actually

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:51.900 align:middle line:84%
filled to the brim with the
energy of the field, the Higgs

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:54.960 align:middle line:84%
field, the divine matrix,
and all the potential

00:02:54.960 --> 00:02:56.940 align:middle line:90%
that that matrix holds.

00:02:56.940 --> 00:02:58.440 align:middle line:84%
Well, when we think
about this, it's

00:02:58.440 --> 00:03:00.630 align:middle line:84%
actually really good
news for you and me

00:03:00.630 --> 00:03:04.095 align:middle line:84%
because what it means is
that most of the stuff that

00:03:04.095 --> 00:03:05.970 align:middle line:84%
makes the universe, as
well as the stuff that

00:03:05.970 --> 00:03:09.510 align:middle line:84%
makes your body and
my body, that stuff--

00:03:09.510 --> 00:03:13.230 align:middle line:84%
beyond the 4% that we know
is matter, it's the matrix.

00:03:13.230 --> 00:03:17.410 align:middle line:84%
And we now know that the matrix
is a malleable field of energy.

00:03:17.410 --> 00:03:20.130 align:middle line:84%
It's a field of energy
that changes in response

00:03:20.130 --> 00:03:23.820 align:middle line:84%
to what we feed that field,
and that we have direct access

00:03:23.820 --> 00:03:27.960 align:middle line:84%
to that field through our
user interface of codes

00:03:27.960 --> 00:03:29.623 align:middle line:90%
like language and emotion.

00:03:29.623 --> 00:03:32.040 align:middle line:84%
Now, once again, I know this
is a very, very different way

00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:35.010 align:middle line:84%
of thinking about the world
and about our bodies--

00:03:35.010 --> 00:03:37.770 align:middle line:84%
on the one hand
because we are steeped

00:03:37.770 --> 00:03:41.100 align:middle line:84%
in the story of physical
matter and separation.

00:03:41.100 --> 00:03:43.770 align:middle line:84%
But on the other hand, what I'm
sharing with you right now--

00:03:43.770 --> 00:03:47.100 align:middle line:84%
it is where the leading
edge discoveries

00:03:47.100 --> 00:03:49.020 align:middle line:90%
are taking us right now.

00:03:49.020 --> 00:03:52.980 align:middle line:84%
So while these discoveries
may sound complex,

00:03:52.980 --> 00:03:55.290 align:middle line:84%
the whole process is
actually very simple,

00:03:55.290 --> 00:03:58.910 align:middle line:84%
the process of how we
interact with this matrix.

00:03:58.910 --> 00:04:01.560 align:middle line:84%
And I want to say
to you, in my years,

00:04:01.560 --> 00:04:06.360 align:middle line:84%
my decades of exploration of
the universe and the world

00:04:06.360 --> 00:04:09.020 align:middle line:84%
and my body, as
a scientist, I've

00:04:09.020 --> 00:04:11.400 align:middle line:84%
found that nature is
actually very simple.

00:04:11.400 --> 00:04:12.750 align:middle line:90%
Nature is simple.

00:04:12.750 --> 00:04:15.550 align:middle line:84%
Nature works upon
simple principles.

00:04:15.550 --> 00:04:17.430 align:middle line:84%
And it only becomes
complex when we

00:04:17.430 --> 00:04:19.410 align:middle line:84%
make it complex
through the words

00:04:19.410 --> 00:04:21.540 align:middle line:84%
that we use to describe
it, the mathematics

00:04:21.540 --> 00:04:23.470 align:middle line:90%
that we use to describe it.

00:04:23.470 --> 00:04:27.210 align:middle line:84%
So now that we've developed,
in the previous episodes,

00:04:27.210 --> 00:04:30.900 align:middle line:84%
the ideas and you and I
have a new vocabulary that

00:04:30.900 --> 00:04:33.600 align:middle line:84%
helps us to understand our
relationship to the matrix,

00:04:33.600 --> 00:04:37.200 align:middle line:84%
we can now use everything
that we have done together

00:04:37.200 --> 00:04:41.530 align:middle line:84%
to see precisely how this
act of creation works,

00:04:41.530 --> 00:04:47.590 align:middle line:84%
how we reach in to the quantum
potential of the divine matrix,

00:04:47.590 --> 00:04:52.020 align:middle line:84%
how we isolate a specific
possibility in our lives,

00:04:52.020 --> 00:04:55.410 align:middle line:84%
and how we collapse the
waves of that possibility

00:04:55.410 --> 00:04:58.450 align:middle line:84%
into the particles of
our everyday lives.

00:04:58.450 --> 00:05:00.572 align:middle line:90%
Here's what I mean.

00:05:00.572 --> 00:05:03.030 align:middle line:84%
If you consider the image that
you're seeing on your screen

00:05:03.030 --> 00:05:06.570 align:middle line:84%
right now, on the left hand
side, what you're seeing

00:05:06.570 --> 00:05:10.510 align:middle line:84%
is a representation of a field
of energy that's in motion.

00:05:10.510 --> 00:05:15.300 align:middle line:84%
Now, in the quantum world,
this represents potential.

00:05:15.300 --> 00:05:18.360 align:middle line:84%
But you can see that
the motion is behaving

00:05:18.360 --> 00:05:19.710 align:middle line:90%
in a very specific way.

00:05:19.710 --> 00:05:22.950 align:middle line:84%
Can you see on the
screen how the energy

00:05:22.950 --> 00:05:26.520 align:middle line:90%
seems to be imploding, OK?

00:05:26.520 --> 00:05:28.920 align:middle line:84%
The energy is
moving from outward.

00:05:28.920 --> 00:05:31.500 align:middle line:84%
And it's being directed
inward, toward the center.

00:05:31.500 --> 00:05:35.040 align:middle line:84%
If that's not clear to you,
the second image on your screen

00:05:35.040 --> 00:05:37.330 align:middle line:90%
may help to see by comparison.

00:05:37.330 --> 00:05:41.130 align:middle line:84%
This is also representing
energy in the matrix.

00:05:41.130 --> 00:05:43.260 align:middle line:84%
It's representing
quantum possibilities.

00:05:43.260 --> 00:05:45.240 align:middle line:84%
But can you see
what's happening?

00:05:45.240 --> 00:05:46.920 align:middle line:84%
Can you see how
the energy appears

00:05:46.920 --> 00:05:51.980 align:middle line:84%
to be emerging from a central
source and moving outward?

00:05:51.980 --> 00:05:55.440 align:middle line:84%
And when you look at
these two images together,

00:05:55.440 --> 00:05:59.100 align:middle line:84%
they are a very good, a
very accurate representation

00:05:59.100 --> 00:06:02.570 align:middle line:84%
of precisely what's happening in
the divine matrix all around us

00:06:02.570 --> 00:06:07.770 align:middle line:84%
in our lives all the time in
the field that surrounds us,

00:06:07.770 --> 00:06:09.810 align:middle line:90%
the field that we are part of.

00:06:09.810 --> 00:06:13.090 align:middle line:84%
Remember, every atom of your
body, every atom in my body--

00:06:13.090 --> 00:06:14.860 align:middle line:84%
it's not like
we're in the field.

00:06:14.860 --> 00:06:18.870 align:middle line:84%
We are emerging constantly
from this field.

00:06:18.870 --> 00:06:22.110 align:middle line:90%
It's a dynamic state, all right?

00:06:22.110 --> 00:06:25.900 align:middle line:84%
So if you consider this field
that we are emerging from,

00:06:25.900 --> 00:06:29.310 align:middle line:84%
that we're interacting with,
from the perspective of what

00:06:29.310 --> 00:06:33.390 align:middle line:84%
I'm saying to you right
now, all possibilities

00:06:33.390 --> 00:06:37.260 align:middle line:90%
already exist in this field.

00:06:37.260 --> 00:06:43.650 align:middle line:84%
All possibilities already
exist as quantum potential.

00:06:43.650 --> 00:06:46.690 align:middle line:84%
It's kind of like saying, there
really isn't anything new.

00:06:46.690 --> 00:06:51.060 align:middle line:84%
It's all already been created
as potential in the field.

00:06:51.060 --> 00:06:52.510 align:middle line:84%
All right, so
here's what happens.

00:06:52.510 --> 00:06:56.520 align:middle line:84%
You and I, when we choose
to create something new

00:06:56.520 --> 00:06:58.560 align:middle line:84%
in our lives, when we
choose to heal our bodies,

00:06:58.560 --> 00:07:02.610 align:middle line:84%
when we hold the image in our
mind of what it is that we

00:07:02.610 --> 00:07:08.940 align:middle line:84%
choose to create, the act of
holding the image in our minds

00:07:08.940 --> 00:07:14.910 align:middle line:84%
is the act of us reaching into
the potential of this field,

00:07:14.910 --> 00:07:16.170 align:middle line:90%
of the divine matrix.

00:07:16.170 --> 00:07:19.590 align:middle line:84%
We're literally reaching
in on an energetic level

00:07:19.590 --> 00:07:22.980 align:middle line:84%
in the presence of all
of these possibilities.

00:07:22.980 --> 00:07:26.160 align:middle line:84%
And we're finding the one
that we now have created

00:07:26.160 --> 00:07:27.720 align:middle line:90%
to focus upon, all right?

00:07:27.720 --> 00:07:31.470 align:middle line:84%
And once we find that, I want
to show you what happens.

00:07:31.470 --> 00:07:33.900 align:middle line:84%
The next image that
you see on your screen

00:07:33.900 --> 00:07:37.760 align:middle line:84%
is also a field of
energy, all right?

00:07:37.760 --> 00:07:39.680 align:middle line:84%
But can you see
how this field is

00:07:39.680 --> 00:07:41.330 align:middle line:90%
different than the other two?

00:07:41.330 --> 00:07:44.880 align:middle line:84%
The one on the left, the
energy is imploding inward.

00:07:44.880 --> 00:07:47.450 align:middle line:84%
The one in the center
now, the energy

00:07:47.450 --> 00:07:49.328 align:middle line:90%
is emerging from the center.

00:07:49.328 --> 00:07:50.870 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to ask
you to ask yourself,

00:07:50.870 --> 00:07:53.810 align:middle line:84%
what's happening to the one
that you see on the far right?

00:07:53.810 --> 00:07:54.970 align:middle line:90%
Is it imploding inward?

00:07:54.970 --> 00:07:55.880 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:07:55.880 --> 00:07:57.470 align:middle line:90%
Is it emerging from the center?

00:07:57.470 --> 00:07:58.430 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:07:58.430 --> 00:08:00.650 align:middle line:90%
It's pulsing in place.

00:08:00.650 --> 00:08:04.250 align:middle line:84%
That is the secret to
creating in the divine matrix.

00:08:04.250 --> 00:08:09.080 align:middle line:84%
That's the secret to
reaching into the potential,

00:08:09.080 --> 00:08:12.410 align:middle line:84%
grabbing that
potential in your life,

00:08:12.410 --> 00:08:15.530 align:middle line:84%
and isolating that
potential and making it

00:08:15.530 --> 00:08:18.710 align:middle line:84%
into something that is real,
because what you're seeing

00:08:18.710 --> 00:08:22.130 align:middle line:84%
right now, the energy
that is pulsing in place,

00:08:22.130 --> 00:08:24.750 align:middle line:90%
that is the energy of an atom.

00:08:24.750 --> 00:08:28.050 align:middle line:90%
So an atom is a field of energy.

00:08:28.050 --> 00:08:29.960 align:middle line:90%
It's not imploding inward.

00:08:29.960 --> 00:08:33.289 align:middle line:84%
It's not emerging
out from within.

00:08:33.289 --> 00:08:34.880 align:middle line:90%
It is vibrating.

00:08:34.880 --> 00:08:36.980 align:middle line:90%
It's pulsing in place.

00:08:36.980 --> 00:08:40.789 align:middle line:84%
That is the energy that is
represented as physical matter

00:08:40.789 --> 00:08:41.600 align:middle line:90%
in our world.

00:08:41.600 --> 00:08:44.750 align:middle line:84%
So now we've gone
from quantum potential

00:08:44.750 --> 00:08:49.110 align:middle line:84%
to physical reality in our
world and in our lives.

00:08:49.110 --> 00:08:50.900 align:middle line:84%
So what we have in
our imagination--

00:08:50.900 --> 00:08:51.950 align:middle line:84%
and there are different
ways that we're

00:08:51.950 --> 00:08:52.970 align:middle line:90%
conditioned to imagine.

00:08:52.970 --> 00:08:55.700 align:middle line:90%
Prayer is a form of imagination.

00:08:55.700 --> 00:09:00.590 align:middle line:84%
When we are asking
for a possibility

00:09:00.590 --> 00:09:04.580 align:middle line:84%
to be fulfilled in our
lives, what we're asking

00:09:04.580 --> 00:09:07.670 align:middle line:84%
is for the ability to reach
into that field of quantum

00:09:07.670 --> 00:09:10.700 align:middle line:84%
potential, isolate that
possibility-- our healing,

00:09:10.700 --> 00:09:12.290 align:middle line:84%
or the healing of
our loved ones,

00:09:12.290 --> 00:09:16.580 align:middle line:84%
or our perfect relationship,
or the abundance or success,

00:09:16.580 --> 00:09:18.613 align:middle line:90%
or whatever it is in our lives.

00:09:18.613 --> 00:09:20.030 align:middle line:84%
What we're doing
is we're reaching

00:09:20.030 --> 00:09:24.505 align:middle line:84%
into that field of potential
where all things are in motion,

00:09:24.505 --> 00:09:25.505 align:middle line:90%
all those possibilities.

00:09:25.505 --> 00:09:28.090 align:middle line:84%
It's like, oh, there's
my perfect relationship.

00:09:28.090 --> 00:09:31.600 align:middle line:84%
Oh, there it goes, because
look at what's happening.

00:09:31.600 --> 00:09:33.050 align:middle line:90%
It's in motion.

00:09:33.050 --> 00:09:35.180 align:middle line:90%
Or, there's my healing.

00:09:35.180 --> 00:09:37.220 align:middle line:84%
But oh, look--
well, it's fleeting.

00:09:37.220 --> 00:09:38.420 align:middle line:90%
Where did it go?

00:09:38.420 --> 00:09:40.370 align:middle line:90%
Because it's in motion.

00:09:40.370 --> 00:09:43.880 align:middle line:84%
We are the only form of
life that we're aware of,

00:09:43.880 --> 00:09:46.850 align:middle line:84%
right now, that are given
the gift of consciously--

00:09:46.850 --> 00:09:50.180 align:middle line:84%
in a moment in time--
choosing to reach

00:09:50.180 --> 00:09:54.110 align:middle line:84%
into this state of
energetic potential

00:09:54.110 --> 00:09:58.820 align:middle line:84%
to collapse the waves of what
is possible into something that

00:09:58.820 --> 00:09:59.750 align:middle line:90%
is real.

00:09:59.750 --> 00:10:02.768 align:middle line:84%
And it's represented by
the atom in our lives.

00:10:02.768 --> 00:10:04.310 align:middle line:84%
So another way of
saying this-- there

00:10:04.310 --> 00:10:06.830 align:middle line:84%
are different ways of
looking at what we're doing.

00:10:06.830 --> 00:10:10.610 align:middle line:84%
If you're a scientist, what you
would say is that in the field

00:10:10.610 --> 00:10:14.900 align:middle line:84%
are the scalar
potentials, scalar waves.

00:10:14.900 --> 00:10:17.360 align:middle line:84%
And it's when we
reach in and isolate

00:10:17.360 --> 00:10:20.420 align:middle line:84%
those they become the
vector reality of our lives.

00:10:20.420 --> 00:10:22.580 align:middle line:84%
Or if that sounds too
complicated, what you say

00:10:22.580 --> 00:10:24.230 align:middle line:84%
is we reach in with
the possibility

00:10:24.230 --> 00:10:26.060 align:middle line:90%
of a wish or a prayer.

00:10:26.060 --> 00:10:29.180 align:middle line:84%
And the reality is the outcome
of that wish or that prayer.

00:10:29.180 --> 00:10:31.820 align:middle line:90%


00:10:31.820 --> 00:10:35.730 align:middle line:10%
What I've just shared with
you is an explanation,

00:10:35.730 --> 00:10:39.150 align:middle line:10%
an illustration of a very
famous principle that was

00:10:39.150 --> 00:10:43.530 align:middle line:10%
demonstrated-- the first time
in 1801 and again in 1927--

00:10:43.530 --> 00:10:46.200 align:middle line:10%
in the realm of physics, an
experiment that is famously

00:10:46.200 --> 00:10:48.570 align:middle line:10%
called the double-slit
experiment.

00:10:48.570 --> 00:10:51.750 align:middle line:10%
And that double-slit
experiment is illustrating

00:10:51.750 --> 00:10:56.430 align:middle line:10%
the potential of us interacting
with the energy in this field.

00:10:56.430 --> 00:10:58.030 align:middle line:90%
In the double slit experiment--

00:10:58.030 --> 00:10:59.970 align:middle line:84%
I'll just summarize
it very briefly--

00:10:59.970 --> 00:11:03.960 align:middle line:84%
what scientists found was when
they direct a beam of light

00:11:03.960 --> 00:11:08.010 align:middle line:84%
through a shield that has
two openings, two slits,

00:11:08.010 --> 00:11:10.260 align:middle line:84%
the light will go through
both of those slits.

00:11:10.260 --> 00:11:12.900 align:middle line:84%
And it will appear as
an interference pattern

00:11:12.900 --> 00:11:17.700 align:middle line:84%
on a target on the
other side of the shield

00:11:17.700 --> 00:11:22.770 align:middle line:84%
only until the light beam
is observed in some way.

00:11:22.770 --> 00:11:24.570 align:middle line:84%
And the observation
can be a human eye.

00:11:24.570 --> 00:11:25.780 align:middle line:90%
It can be a machine.

00:11:25.780 --> 00:11:28.230 align:middle line:84%
It can be a camera
that's watching it.

00:11:28.230 --> 00:11:32.370 align:middle line:84%
And when the light is observed,
what the scientists found--

00:11:32.370 --> 00:11:33.660 align:middle line:90%
and this is the mystery.

00:11:33.660 --> 00:11:37.050 align:middle line:84%
And this is also
illustrating the potential

00:11:37.050 --> 00:11:38.490 align:middle line:90%
that I've just shared with you.

00:11:38.490 --> 00:11:42.320 align:middle line:84%
When that light, when the
energy of those photons,

00:11:42.320 --> 00:11:47.100 align:middle line:84%
that quantum energy is observed,
it changes its character

00:11:47.100 --> 00:11:51.750 align:middle line:84%
from waves that are going
through both of those slits

00:11:51.750 --> 00:11:53.070 align:middle line:90%
to particles.

00:11:53.070 --> 00:11:57.810 align:middle line:84%
And it changes the way that
that energy is illustrated

00:11:57.810 --> 00:11:59.940 align:middle line:90%
upon the screen of the target.

00:11:59.940 --> 00:12:05.010 align:middle line:84%
The act of observation is having
a direct effect upon the light.

00:12:05.010 --> 00:12:07.800 align:middle line:84%
The light "knows"-- and I'm
going to put that in quotes.

00:12:07.800 --> 00:12:10.290 align:middle line:84%
The light "knows" that
it's being observed.

00:12:10.290 --> 00:12:12.840 align:middle line:84%
And as it's being
observed, it collapses

00:12:12.840 --> 00:12:14.880 align:middle line:84%
from the wave
expression of itself

00:12:14.880 --> 00:12:17.320 align:middle line:84%
into the particle
expression of itself.

00:12:17.320 --> 00:12:19.200 align:middle line:84%
So this is the
scientific experiment--

00:12:19.200 --> 00:12:21.570 align:middle line:84%
and also the quandary
and the mystery--

00:12:21.570 --> 00:12:23.940 align:middle line:84%
that illustrates the principle
that I've just shared

00:12:23.940 --> 00:12:27.760 align:middle line:84%
and that we saw
illustrated on our screen.

00:12:27.760 --> 00:12:30.210 align:middle line:84%
So just to be absolutely
clear, what I'm saying

00:12:30.210 --> 00:12:34.200 align:middle line:84%
is that when we create in
the field, in the matrix--

00:12:34.200 --> 00:12:37.010 align:middle line:84%
either consciously
or subconsciously--

00:12:37.010 --> 00:12:40.380 align:middle line:84%
what we think of as
making something happen

00:12:40.380 --> 00:12:44.220 align:middle line:84%
is better described as us
choosing an outcome that

00:12:44.220 --> 00:12:47.640 align:middle line:84%
already exists in a field
of many possible outcomes

00:12:47.640 --> 00:12:51.720 align:middle line:84%
by collapsing the infinite
possibilities of the matrix

00:12:51.720 --> 00:12:55.000 align:middle line:84%
into the finite experience
of a single choice.

00:12:55.000 --> 00:12:57.810 align:middle line:84%
And that choice becomes part
of the 4% of the universe

00:12:57.810 --> 00:13:00.260 align:middle line:90%
that we see as physical matter.

00:13:00.260 --> 00:13:03.700 align:middle line:84%
Now, this is true for the
healing of our bodies.

00:13:03.700 --> 00:13:06.370 align:middle line:84%
It's true for the changes
that we bring into the world.

00:13:06.370 --> 00:13:07.787 align:middle line:84%
It's true for the
changes that you

00:13:07.787 --> 00:13:09.380 align:middle line:84%
create in your
relationships, changes

00:13:09.380 --> 00:13:10.920 align:middle line:90%
you create in your life.

00:13:10.920 --> 00:13:14.430 align:middle line:84%
And this is where you and your
choice of language comes in.

00:13:14.430 --> 00:13:18.870 align:middle line:84%
Because the science shows us
that the observation fueled

00:13:18.870 --> 00:13:21.750 align:middle line:84%
by emotion is what
translates the possibilities,

00:13:21.750 --> 00:13:23.790 align:middle line:84%
the quantum
possibilities the field,

00:13:23.790 --> 00:13:27.750 align:middle line:84%
into the physical reality
of our bodies and our world.

00:13:27.750 --> 00:13:32.100 align:middle line:84%
So the idea of the quantum
possibilities in our lives,

00:13:32.100 --> 00:13:37.320 align:middle line:84%
and the way they move from
potential into reality

00:13:37.320 --> 00:13:40.230 align:middle line:84%
through our interacting
with the field--

00:13:40.230 --> 00:13:42.720 align:middle line:84%
it opens the door to
even another possibility.

00:13:42.720 --> 00:13:44.670 align:middle line:84%
And it references
an idea that we

00:13:44.670 --> 00:13:48.370 align:middle line:84%
talked about in a previous
episode of this series.

00:13:48.370 --> 00:13:51.530 align:middle line:84%
Those quantum potentials--
the word "quanta,"

00:13:51.530 --> 00:13:53.410 align:middle line:90%
it is a packet of light.

00:13:53.410 --> 00:13:57.940 align:middle line:84%
But that packet of light is
not a solid beam of light.

00:13:57.940 --> 00:14:02.800 align:middle line:84%
The packet is a
periodic pulse of light.

00:14:02.800 --> 00:14:05.830 align:middle line:84%
We live in an
intermittent reality.

00:14:05.830 --> 00:14:07.840 align:middle line:84%
What we think of as
solid reality-- when

00:14:07.840 --> 00:14:09.520 align:middle line:84%
you look at me on
this camera, I'm

00:14:09.520 --> 00:14:12.010 align:middle line:84%
hoping that to
you, I look solid.

00:14:12.010 --> 00:14:17.740 align:middle line:84%
But the reason I look solid is
because every atom of my body

00:14:17.740 --> 00:14:20.980 align:middle line:84%
is emerging from
the field as pulses

00:14:20.980 --> 00:14:23.570 align:middle line:84%
of energy, little packets
that are called quanta.

00:14:23.570 --> 00:14:24.895 align:middle line:90%
Each pulse is called a quanta.

00:14:24.895 --> 00:14:27.790 align:middle line:84%
And this is where quantum
physics comes from.

00:14:27.790 --> 00:14:33.010 align:middle line:84%
And it's happening so quickly
that your brain is actually

00:14:33.010 --> 00:14:35.940 align:middle line:84%
taking what your eyes are
seeing-- your eyes see

00:14:35.940 --> 00:14:36.940 align:middle line:90%
the intermittent pulses.

00:14:36.940 --> 00:14:38.197 align:middle line:90%
Your eyes can see this.

00:14:38.197 --> 00:14:39.780 align:middle line:84%
And some people are
actually trained--

00:14:39.780 --> 00:14:41.920 align:middle line:84%
I've been with Tibetan
monks who are able to see

00:14:41.920 --> 00:14:43.150 align:middle line:90%
these individual pulses.

00:14:43.150 --> 00:14:45.310 align:middle line:84%
And the world looks
very different to them.

00:14:45.310 --> 00:14:47.980 align:middle line:90%
It's a very shimmering reality.

00:14:47.980 --> 00:14:50.890 align:middle line:84%
But your brain takes
what your eyes see

00:14:50.890 --> 00:14:53.020 align:middle line:84%
and your brain
averages all of those

00:14:53.020 --> 00:14:57.730 align:middle line:84%
pulses into a single,
constant, continuous stream

00:14:57.730 --> 00:15:01.150 align:middle line:84%
of information that
makes me appear to you

00:15:01.150 --> 00:15:03.155 align:middle line:90%
as a solid physical being.

00:15:03.155 --> 00:15:04.780 align:middle line:84%
Well, there's a lot
of really good news

00:15:04.780 --> 00:15:06.430 align:middle line:90%
in what I'm saying here.

00:15:06.430 --> 00:15:09.850 align:middle line:84%
This pulse reality,
it tells us where

00:15:09.850 --> 00:15:12.610 align:middle line:84%
the action is, as I mentioned
in the previous episode.

00:15:12.610 --> 00:15:14.890 align:middle line:84%
The action is in the
space between the pulses.

00:15:14.890 --> 00:15:16.900 align:middle line:90%
It's in the space between.

00:15:16.900 --> 00:15:19.960 align:middle line:84%
It means that any
possible reality only

00:15:19.960 --> 00:15:22.900 align:middle line:90%
exists until the pulse ends.

00:15:22.900 --> 00:15:24.700 align:middle line:84%
And then there's a
point in between where

00:15:24.700 --> 00:15:26.830 align:middle line:90%
that reality isn't present.

00:15:26.830 --> 00:15:29.360 align:middle line:84%
And it's not present--
it's neither.

00:15:29.360 --> 00:15:32.290 align:middle line:84%
And then the next
pulse will continue

00:15:32.290 --> 00:15:35.320 align:middle line:84%
to express the reality,
the previous pulse,

00:15:35.320 --> 00:15:37.240 align:middle line:90%
unless something changes it.

00:15:37.240 --> 00:15:38.680 align:middle line:84%
Well, it's pretty
much impossible

00:15:38.680 --> 00:15:43.510 align:middle line:84%
for you and I to go in and time
the pulse between one quanta

00:15:43.510 --> 00:15:45.230 align:middle line:90%
burst and another.

00:15:45.230 --> 00:15:48.220 align:middle line:84%
And that's why
we, instead, adapt

00:15:48.220 --> 00:15:50.440 align:middle line:90%
a way of thinking and feeling.

00:15:50.440 --> 00:15:54.460 align:middle line:84%
We fuel our imagination with
the power of human emotion.

00:15:54.460 --> 00:15:57.010 align:middle line:84%
And we create-- we
set in the place

00:15:57.010 --> 00:16:01.420 align:middle line:84%
a wave that is present
when the pulse ends

00:16:01.420 --> 00:16:03.610 align:middle line:84%
and the next one begins
in that space in between.

00:16:03.610 --> 00:16:05.045 align:middle line:90%
And the wave is already there.

00:16:05.045 --> 00:16:07.420 align:middle line:84%
And this is really good news
when it comes to you and me,

00:16:07.420 --> 00:16:10.150 align:middle line:84%
because if there is
something in our lives

00:16:10.150 --> 00:16:11.650 align:middle line:90%
that we would like to change--

00:16:11.650 --> 00:16:15.180 align:middle line:84%
we'd like a physical
healing in our bodies--

00:16:15.180 --> 00:16:18.370 align:middle line:84%
it is our ability to interact
with this pulse reality that

00:16:18.370 --> 00:16:21.670 align:middle line:84%
produces what medical
doctors and scientists often

00:16:21.670 --> 00:16:24.400 align:middle line:84%
call spontaneous
healings or miracles.

00:16:24.400 --> 00:16:26.940 align:middle line:84%
There's nothing in the
scientific literature

00:16:26.940 --> 00:16:29.440 align:middle line:84%
as it is today and is taught
in our universities that

00:16:29.440 --> 00:16:32.670 align:middle line:84%
makes room for this kind of
interaction within the body.

00:16:32.670 --> 00:16:34.510 align:middle line:84%
So when we see the
spontaneous healings that

00:16:34.510 --> 00:16:35.880 align:middle line:90%
we all have heard of--

00:16:35.880 --> 00:16:39.370 align:middle line:84%
and I've shared some with you
throughout "The Divine Matrix."

00:16:39.370 --> 00:16:41.350 align:middle line:84%
I've shared them with
you in "Missing Links."

00:16:41.350 --> 00:16:44.330 align:middle line:84%
I actually shared a
video in Season One

00:16:44.330 --> 00:16:46.003 align:middle line:90%
of one of these healings.

00:16:46.003 --> 00:16:47.920 align:middle line:84%
When scientists and
medical doctors see these,

00:16:47.920 --> 00:16:52.650 align:middle line:84%
they have to say either that
they originally misdiagnosed

00:16:52.650 --> 00:16:55.450 align:middle line:84%
what was happening or
that what has happened

00:16:55.450 --> 00:16:57.910 align:middle line:84%
is attributed to what
they call a miracle.

00:16:57.910 --> 00:16:59.260 align:middle line:90%
Well, it's only a miracle--

00:16:59.260 --> 00:17:01.630 align:middle line:84%
a miracle is only
a miracle until we

00:17:01.630 --> 00:17:03.740 align:middle line:90%
understand how it works.

00:17:03.740 --> 00:17:06.250 align:middle line:84%
And once we understand
how that miracle works,

00:17:06.250 --> 00:17:08.710 align:middle line:84%
maybe it doesn't sound quite
as romantic as a miracle.

00:17:08.710 --> 00:17:11.170 align:middle line:84%
But it becomes a technology,
becomes something

00:17:11.170 --> 00:17:14.300 align:middle line:84%
that we can replicate
again and again and again.

00:17:14.300 --> 00:17:15.819 align:middle line:90%
Well, we work this way.

00:17:15.819 --> 00:17:19.430 align:middle line:84%
Our lives, our bodies, and
our world work this way.

00:17:19.430 --> 00:17:20.420 align:middle line:90%
So what does this mean?

00:17:20.420 --> 00:17:22.750 align:middle line:84%
It tells us that we
have the opportunity

00:17:22.750 --> 00:17:24.220 align:middle line:90%
to make these changes.

00:17:24.220 --> 00:17:26.680 align:middle line:84%
Now, I want to share
something with you.

00:17:26.680 --> 00:17:29.750 align:middle line:84%
And my live audiences
find this fascinating.

00:17:29.750 --> 00:17:32.530 align:middle line:84%
Our bodies-- you know that our
bodies regenerate themselves

00:17:32.530 --> 00:17:33.700 align:middle line:90%
constantly.

00:17:33.700 --> 00:17:36.450 align:middle line:90%
In about a year--

00:17:36.450 --> 00:17:40.480 align:middle line:90%
365 days-- we become new people.

00:17:40.480 --> 00:17:42.950 align:middle line:84%
But we don't become new
people all at the same time.

00:17:42.950 --> 00:17:45.490 align:middle line:10%
Different parts of
our body regenerate

00:17:45.490 --> 00:17:47.710 align:middle line:10%
in different periods of time.

00:17:47.710 --> 00:17:51.550 align:middle line:84%
And I'd like to go through just
some specific organs and tissue

00:17:51.550 --> 00:17:55.330 align:middle line:84%
and DNA and give you an example
of what I'm talking about here,

00:17:55.330 --> 00:17:59.260 align:middle line:84%
because the fact that we
are constantly regenerating

00:17:59.260 --> 00:18:02.140 align:middle line:84%
means that the
pattern that gives us

00:18:02.140 --> 00:18:06.170 align:middle line:84%
what we are in the moment
is not set in stone.

00:18:06.170 --> 00:18:07.510 align:middle line:90%
It is constantly changing.

00:18:07.510 --> 00:18:12.430 align:middle line:84%
And we have the opportunity in
those periods of regeneration--

00:18:12.430 --> 00:18:14.980 align:middle line:84%
if we like what we have, we
don't need to do anything.

00:18:14.980 --> 00:18:16.690 align:middle line:84%
If we don't like
what we have, if we'd

00:18:16.690 --> 00:18:21.410 align:middle line:84%
like to change into a healthier
expression of ourselves,

00:18:21.410 --> 00:18:26.940 align:middle line:84%
then we can create the field
through our thoughts, feelings,

00:18:26.940 --> 00:18:27.740 align:middle line:90%
emotions.

00:18:27.740 --> 00:18:29.590 align:middle line:84%
And in the next
episode, we're going

00:18:29.590 --> 00:18:32.220 align:middle line:84%
to begin talking about the
actual techniques to do this.

00:18:32.220 --> 00:18:35.380 align:middle line:84%
So we're laying the foundation
and the segue for that

00:18:35.380 --> 00:18:38.140 align:middle line:84%
so that what we do in the
future episodes makes sense.

00:18:38.140 --> 00:18:41.500 align:middle line:84%
We'll tie it back
into this episode.

00:18:41.500 --> 00:18:43.480 align:middle line:84%
Again, we're building
a vocabulary.

00:18:43.480 --> 00:18:46.310 align:middle line:84%
And we're building a
common understanding

00:18:46.310 --> 00:18:47.650 align:middle line:90%
so that we are empowered.

00:18:47.650 --> 00:18:50.230 align:middle line:84%
And that's my goal, is to
empower you, to empower you

00:18:50.230 --> 00:18:52.390 align:middle line:90%
through this new wisdom.

00:18:52.390 --> 00:18:58.030 align:middle line:84%
So when we hold the image in
our mind of our perfect healing,

00:18:58.030 --> 00:19:03.040 align:middle line:84%
and then we fuel that image
through empowered emotion,

00:19:03.040 --> 00:19:05.920 align:middle line:84%
the emotion is what
gives the image the power

00:19:05.920 --> 00:19:08.890 align:middle line:84%
to collapse that
possibility into a particle.

00:19:08.890 --> 00:19:11.650 align:middle line:84%
What we're doing is we're
creating the blueprint that

00:19:11.650 --> 00:19:15.070 align:middle line:84%
now becomes the blueprint
for the next iteration

00:19:15.070 --> 00:19:17.350 align:middle line:84%
of whatever's happening
in the matrix.

00:19:17.350 --> 00:19:19.480 align:middle line:84%
And for this conversation,
I'm talking about what's

00:19:19.480 --> 00:19:21.310 align:middle line:90%
happening within our bodies.

00:19:21.310 --> 00:19:23.200 align:middle line:84%
So I'm going to
invite you to look

00:19:23.200 --> 00:19:25.060 align:middle line:90%
at the image on the screen.

00:19:25.060 --> 00:19:28.480 align:middle line:84%
I want to go through just a
few of the key organs and share

00:19:28.480 --> 00:19:31.420 align:middle line:84%
with you how quickly--
in what periods of time--

00:19:31.420 --> 00:19:34.270 align:middle line:90%
they typically regenerate.

00:19:34.270 --> 00:19:36.250 align:middle line:84%
So what you're
seeing on your screen

00:19:36.250 --> 00:19:40.330 align:middle line:84%
is an illustration of
some of the key places

00:19:40.330 --> 00:19:42.610 align:middle line:84%
in the body where this
regeneration happens.

00:19:42.610 --> 00:19:48.300 align:middle line:84%
DNA, for example, renews
itself every two months.

00:19:48.300 --> 00:19:50.730 align:middle line:84%
Every two months of
our lives, the DNA

00:19:50.730 --> 00:19:54.750 align:middle line:84%
is replicating in a way
that allows a new template

00:19:54.750 --> 00:19:56.292 align:middle line:90%
to be put into place.

00:19:56.292 --> 00:19:58.500 align:middle line:84%
So what that means is, if
you're happy with your body

00:19:58.500 --> 00:20:00.930 align:middle line:84%
and you're happy with the
expression of your DNA,

00:20:00.930 --> 00:20:02.550 align:middle line:90%
there's no need to do anything.

00:20:02.550 --> 00:20:04.200 align:middle line:84%
If your body is
showing you something

00:20:04.200 --> 00:20:06.090 align:middle line:84%
that you'd like to
change or something

00:20:06.090 --> 00:20:09.280 align:middle line:84%
that medical doctors are
saying that you must change,

00:20:09.280 --> 00:20:11.117 align:middle line:90%
this is an opportunity.

00:20:11.117 --> 00:20:13.200 align:middle line:84%
It's the potential-- it's
another way of thinking,

00:20:13.200 --> 00:20:15.000 align:middle line:84%
a very different
way of thinking--

00:20:15.000 --> 00:20:17.400 align:middle line:84%
of going in and
changing that template,

00:20:17.400 --> 00:20:21.160 align:middle line:84%
changing the blueprint for the
next expression of your DNA.

00:20:21.160 --> 00:20:24.510 align:middle line:84%
Your skin rebuilds
itself in about a month.

00:20:24.510 --> 00:20:27.670 align:middle line:84%
Your liver rebuilds
itself in about six weeks.

00:20:27.670 --> 00:20:31.455 align:middle line:84%
Your brain-- you have a brand
new brain after about one year.

00:20:31.455 --> 00:20:34.080 align:middle line:84%
And this is so interesting to me
because when I was in school--

00:20:34.080 --> 00:20:37.710 align:middle line:84%
once again, back in 1950s,
'60s, and early '70s--

00:20:37.710 --> 00:20:39.870 align:middle line:84%
I was taught that there
are certain organs

00:20:39.870 --> 00:20:43.620 align:middle line:84%
and certain tissues in the human
body that do not regenerate.

00:20:43.620 --> 00:20:45.780 align:middle line:84%
Now we know, every
organ in the human body

00:20:45.780 --> 00:20:49.680 align:middle line:84%
has the ability to regenerate
and replicate and heal itself,

00:20:49.680 --> 00:20:52.290 align:middle line:84%
even the organs and the tissues
we were told could not--

00:20:52.290 --> 00:20:55.860 align:middle line:84%
brain tissue, spinal cord
tissue, pancreatic tissue,

00:20:55.860 --> 00:20:57.060 align:middle line:90%
for example.

00:20:57.060 --> 00:21:00.480 align:middle line:84%
Your blood-- your blood rebuilds
itself in about four months.

00:21:00.480 --> 00:21:03.840 align:middle line:84%
Now, I'm being really careful
about what I'm saying here.

00:21:03.840 --> 00:21:05.460 align:middle line:90%
When you give blood--

00:21:05.460 --> 00:21:08.770 align:middle line:84%
for example, you have blood
drawn for medical tests--

00:21:08.770 --> 00:21:11.950 align:middle line:84%
the blood serum replenishes
itself very quickly.

00:21:11.950 --> 00:21:13.800 align:middle line:90%
But the red blood cells--

00:21:13.800 --> 00:21:16.350 align:middle line:84%
it takes about four
months for the blood cells

00:21:16.350 --> 00:21:17.800 align:middle line:90%
to actually rebuild itself.

00:21:17.800 --> 00:21:21.120 align:middle line:84%
So the volume replaces
itself quicker.

00:21:21.120 --> 00:21:24.070 align:middle line:10%
But the actual red blood cells
take a little bit longer.

00:21:24.070 --> 00:21:25.480 align:middle line:10%
Your bones?

00:21:25.480 --> 00:21:28.740 align:middle line:10%
Your bones-- you build a whole
new skeleton in about 90 days,

00:21:28.740 --> 00:21:30.430 align:middle line:10%
in about three months.

00:21:30.430 --> 00:21:34.270 align:middle line:10%
So from these examples, we can
see how the growth of our body

00:21:34.270 --> 00:21:35.070 align:middle line:10%
is intermittent.

00:21:35.070 --> 00:21:36.040 align:middle line:10%
It's not solid.

00:21:36.040 --> 00:21:36.910 align:middle line:10%
It's not continuous.

00:21:36.910 --> 00:21:38.250 align:middle line:10%
It's not constant.

00:21:38.250 --> 00:21:39.660 align:middle line:90%
There are cycles.

00:21:39.660 --> 00:21:41.800 align:middle line:84%
And if we know how
those cycles work,

00:21:41.800 --> 00:21:44.800 align:middle line:84%
and if we know those cycles
are based upon a pulse reality

00:21:44.800 --> 00:21:47.310 align:middle line:84%
and if we understand our
relationship to that reality,

00:21:47.310 --> 00:21:49.800 align:middle line:90%
we are empowered to participate.

00:21:49.800 --> 00:21:51.300 align:middle line:84%
I'm being very clear
with this word.

00:21:51.300 --> 00:21:52.633 align:middle line:90%
We're not talking about control.

00:21:52.633 --> 00:21:56.190 align:middle line:84%
I'm not talking about
manipulation of the human body.

00:21:56.190 --> 00:21:58.680 align:middle line:84%
I'm talking about
you consciously

00:21:58.680 --> 00:22:02.522 align:middle line:84%
participating with the health
and the healing of the vehicle

00:22:02.522 --> 00:22:04.230 align:middle line:84%
that gives you the
opportunity to express

00:22:04.230 --> 00:22:06.910 align:middle line:90%
your love in this world.

00:22:06.910 --> 00:22:09.840 align:middle line:84%
So now that we understand
this intermittent reality,

00:22:09.840 --> 00:22:14.040 align:middle line:84%
this pulse reality that
is expressed as our bodies

00:22:14.040 --> 00:22:16.200 align:middle line:84%
in the world, the
question becomes,

00:22:16.200 --> 00:22:19.030 align:middle line:90%
how do we actually interact?

00:22:19.030 --> 00:22:21.990 align:middle line:84%
How do we change that blueprint
of our body, or of the world

00:22:21.990 --> 00:22:24.810 align:middle line:90%
beyond our body?

00:22:24.810 --> 00:22:28.030 align:middle line:10%
A scientific paper
published in the year 2004

00:22:28.030 --> 00:22:31.172 align:middle line:10%
gives us the clue
for precisely this.

00:22:31.172 --> 00:22:33.130 align:middle line:10%
It was published in the
"Journal of Alternative

00:22:33.130 --> 00:22:35.920 align:middle line:10%
and Complementary Medicine,"
volume 10, number 1,

00:22:35.920 --> 00:22:37.360 align:middle line:10%
in the year 2004.

00:22:37.360 --> 00:22:39.840 align:middle line:84%
So you can go and check
this out for yourself.

00:22:39.840 --> 00:22:44.970 align:middle line:84%
But I'd like to read to
you directly a quote that

00:22:44.970 --> 00:22:48.810 align:middle line:84%
is in the conclusion of the
experiments in the studies,

00:22:48.810 --> 00:22:51.930 align:middle line:84%
because what I'm going to say
to you opens the door to all

00:22:51.930 --> 00:22:53.960 align:middle line:84%
the possibilities that
we're talking about,

00:22:53.960 --> 00:22:57.730 align:middle line:84%
and opens the door from
a scientific perspective

00:22:57.730 --> 00:23:01.170 align:middle line:84%
in a peer-reviewed journal,
rather than metaphor

00:23:01.170 --> 00:23:03.930 align:middle line:90%
or hypothesis or conjecture.

00:23:03.930 --> 00:23:07.180 align:middle line:10%
So this is why I think
this is so important.

00:23:07.180 --> 00:23:08.200 align:middle line:10%
So the paper states--

00:23:08.200 --> 00:23:09.370 align:middle line:10%
and this is a quote--

00:23:09.370 --> 00:23:13.450 align:middle line:10%
"there is compelling evidence to
suggest that the physical heart

00:23:13.450 --> 00:23:17.680 align:middle line:10%
is coupled to a field of
information that is not

00:23:17.680 --> 00:23:23.440 align:middle line:10%
bound by the classical limits of
time and space," end of quote.

00:23:23.440 --> 00:23:24.620 align:middle line:90%
Wow.

00:23:24.620 --> 00:23:27.910 align:middle line:84%
So what that is saying is
that within our hearts--

00:23:27.910 --> 00:23:30.490 align:middle line:84%
as we've discovered
throughout this series,

00:23:30.490 --> 00:23:33.280 align:middle line:90%
"Missing Links," we have cells.

00:23:33.280 --> 00:23:37.000 align:middle line:84%
We have sensory neurites,
brain-like cells

00:23:37.000 --> 00:23:40.480 align:middle line:84%
that function in a way
that give us an opportunity

00:23:40.480 --> 00:23:44.320 align:middle line:84%
to transcend the laws of
physics as we know them today.

00:23:44.320 --> 00:23:47.950 align:middle line:84%
Our intuition, our
emotion, our love

00:23:47.950 --> 00:23:51.370 align:middle line:84%
is not bound by the conventional
laws of physics in this world.

00:23:51.370 --> 00:23:55.690 align:middle line:84%
We transcend those laws when
we understand this principle,

00:23:55.690 --> 00:23:58.930 align:middle line:84%
and when we understand how
to work with the heart.

00:23:58.930 --> 00:24:00.640 align:middle line:90%
And language is a key to this.

00:24:00.640 --> 00:24:04.510 align:middle line:10%
This is why I shared the episode
about language in this series

00:24:04.510 --> 00:24:06.940 align:middle line:10%
before we get to the place
where we are right now.

00:24:06.940 --> 00:24:09.970 align:middle line:90%
This is where language comes in.

00:24:09.970 --> 00:24:15.580 align:middle line:84%
The words that we choose are the
codes that direct our neurons

00:24:15.580 --> 00:24:18.010 align:middle line:84%
to reach into the field
of all possibilities--

00:24:18.010 --> 00:24:20.830 align:middle line:84%
into the quantum matrix,
into the divine matrix--

00:24:20.830 --> 00:24:23.440 align:middle line:84%
and once again, to collapse
those many potentials

00:24:23.440 --> 00:24:25.870 align:middle line:84%
into the single
discrete experience

00:24:25.870 --> 00:24:27.790 align:middle line:84%
that we have chosen
in our lives.

00:24:27.790 --> 00:24:30.680 align:middle line:90%


00:24:30.680 --> 00:24:36.050 align:middle line:84%
So the question becomes,
what language are you using?

00:24:36.050 --> 00:24:40.780 align:middle line:84%
What language are you using
to direct your relationship

00:24:40.780 --> 00:24:42.430 align:middle line:90%
with the divine matrix?

00:24:42.430 --> 00:24:45.850 align:middle line:84%
What words do you use
in your conversations,

00:24:45.850 --> 00:24:48.090 align:middle line:84%
in your interactions with
people, day in and day out?

00:24:48.090 --> 00:24:49.590 align:middle line:84%
Do you use your
words consciously?

00:24:49.590 --> 00:24:50.590 align:middle line:90%
Or are they unconscious?

00:24:50.590 --> 00:24:52.930 align:middle line:84%
Are you saying
things subconsciously

00:24:52.930 --> 00:24:55.030 align:middle line:84%
to the field that you
would never intentionally

00:24:55.030 --> 00:24:57.370 align:middle line:90%
say in a million years?

00:24:57.370 --> 00:24:59.250 align:middle line:84%
And when you hear
things like this--

00:24:59.250 --> 00:25:01.910 align:middle line:84%
there was a brilliant man
that I studied with years ago,

00:25:01.910 --> 00:25:04.900 align:middle line:84%
Robert Tennyson
Stevens, who brought

00:25:04.900 --> 00:25:06.460 align:middle line:84%
the ideas of
conscious languaging

00:25:06.460 --> 00:25:09.070 align:middle line:84%
forward in the 20th
century in a way that

00:25:09.070 --> 00:25:12.490 align:middle line:84%
had not been done since the
time of Benjamin Lee Whorf.

00:25:12.490 --> 00:25:15.160 align:middle line:10%
And I remember some
of the examples

00:25:15.160 --> 00:25:17.590 align:middle line:10%
that Robert Stevens
gave to us, and things

00:25:17.590 --> 00:25:18.850 align:middle line:10%
that we say everyday.

00:25:18.850 --> 00:25:24.430 align:middle line:84%
What if everything that
you speak with your words

00:25:24.430 --> 00:25:27.800 align:middle line:84%
is actually a
command to the field?

00:25:27.800 --> 00:25:30.642 align:middle line:84%
What if every word is a
command, even the things

00:25:30.642 --> 00:25:33.100 align:middle line:84%
that we say-- oh, we're just
kidding, or we're just joking?

00:25:33.100 --> 00:25:36.790 align:middle line:84%
How many times do we say,
oh, that really cracks me up,

00:25:36.790 --> 00:25:38.900 align:middle line:84%
when you're laughing
about something?

00:25:38.900 --> 00:25:41.500 align:middle line:84%
Do you really want to be
saying that to the field?

00:25:41.500 --> 00:25:46.690 align:middle line:84%
How many times do people
say, oh, this is to die for.

00:25:46.690 --> 00:25:47.950 align:middle line:90%
I would die for this.

00:25:47.950 --> 00:25:50.650 align:middle line:84%
Is that really what you want
to be saying to the field?

00:25:50.650 --> 00:25:52.660 align:middle line:90%
I could give you examples--

00:25:52.660 --> 00:25:55.960 align:middle line:84%
and I do in the books and in
a lot of our live interactions

00:25:55.960 --> 00:25:58.420 align:middle line:84%
in our workshops-- of
people who have experienced

00:25:58.420 --> 00:26:02.120 align:middle line:84%
precisely what it is that
they're saying into the field.

00:26:02.120 --> 00:26:04.880 align:middle line:84%
It's very common in the
entertainment industry,

00:26:04.880 --> 00:26:07.400 align:middle line:84%
before someone goes onstage,
for the people behind you

00:26:07.400 --> 00:26:09.260 align:middle line:90%
to say, break a leg.

00:26:09.260 --> 00:26:12.830 align:middle line:84%
I cannot tell you how many times
that has happened to people.

00:26:12.830 --> 00:26:15.050 align:middle line:84%
And as they're walking
onto the stage--

00:26:15.050 --> 00:26:18.830 align:middle line:84%
or in one case, actually
already on the stage--

00:26:18.830 --> 00:26:21.440 align:middle line:84%
and the speaker
literally walked off

00:26:21.440 --> 00:26:25.520 align:middle line:84%
of the back of the stage, what
he thought was solid ground.

00:26:25.520 --> 00:26:29.450 align:middle line:84%
And I can't scientifically
connect that experience

00:26:29.450 --> 00:26:32.000 align:middle line:84%
of him literally
walking off the stage

00:26:32.000 --> 00:26:35.090 align:middle line:84%
and breaking a leg to what
happened behind the stage.

00:26:35.090 --> 00:26:39.210 align:middle line:90%
But the parallels are so close.

00:26:39.210 --> 00:26:41.210 align:middle line:84%
So what I have
learned to do now,

00:26:41.210 --> 00:26:43.430 align:middle line:84%
when I am backstage--
myself and my friends--

00:26:43.430 --> 00:26:47.600 align:middle line:84%
if someone comes up and says to
us, break a leg, I'll say, no.

00:26:47.600 --> 00:26:48.900 align:middle line:90%
Heal a heart.

00:26:48.900 --> 00:26:50.550 align:middle line:90%
And we'll walk out on the stage.

00:26:50.550 --> 00:26:53.050 align:middle line:84%
And now I'm going to stages
where I've never been.

00:26:53.050 --> 00:26:54.800 align:middle line:84%
And the people backstage
are saying to me,

00:26:54.800 --> 00:26:56.240 align:middle line:90%
hey, heal a heart.

00:26:56.240 --> 00:26:58.100 align:middle line:90%
So it's making the rounds.

00:26:58.100 --> 00:26:59.130 align:middle line:90%
It's having an effect.

00:26:59.130 --> 00:27:00.440 align:middle line:84%
And it's a very,
very conscious way

00:27:00.440 --> 00:27:01.607 align:middle line:90%
of thinking about ourselves.

00:27:01.607 --> 00:27:03.710 align:middle line:84%
But I'm going to invite
you to think about this.

00:27:03.710 --> 00:27:07.500 align:middle line:84%
Affirmations are very popular
in our culture right now.

00:27:07.500 --> 00:27:08.960 align:middle line:90%
And the idea of an affirmation--

00:27:08.960 --> 00:27:12.390 align:middle line:84%
I think it can be
potentially useful.

00:27:12.390 --> 00:27:16.670 align:middle line:84%
However, to simply say the
same thing a bajillion times

00:27:16.670 --> 00:27:19.710 align:middle line:84%
in a day may not
always have the impact

00:27:19.710 --> 00:27:22.580 align:middle line:84%
if we're not saying it within
the brain state and the heart

00:27:22.580 --> 00:27:25.160 align:middle line:84%
state that allows
what we're saying

00:27:25.160 --> 00:27:27.738 align:middle line:84%
to be interpreted in a
meaningful way by the matrix.

00:27:27.738 --> 00:27:29.780 align:middle line:84%
The next episode, we're
going to talk about this.

00:27:29.780 --> 00:27:31.350 align:middle line:84%
But I want to give
you some examples.

00:27:31.350 --> 00:27:33.910 align:middle line:90%
These are common affirmations.

00:27:33.910 --> 00:27:35.660 align:middle line:90%
I'm not criticizing the authors.

00:27:35.660 --> 00:27:37.160 align:middle line:84%
I'm not criticizing
the affirmation.

00:27:37.160 --> 00:27:39.080 align:middle line:84%
These people were
very well-intentioned.

00:27:39.080 --> 00:27:41.160 align:middle line:84%
But based on what you
and I are doing right now

00:27:41.160 --> 00:27:42.950 align:middle line:84%
and what you now
know to be true,

00:27:42.950 --> 00:27:45.920 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to invite you to
listen these affirmations

00:27:45.920 --> 00:27:48.725 align:middle line:84%
and see where they
could be stronger.

00:27:48.725 --> 00:27:50.850 align:middle line:84%
Now I've chosen-- you're
seeing them on the screen.

00:27:50.850 --> 00:27:54.770 align:middle line:10%
These are some cards, popular
cards from an affirmation deck.

00:27:54.770 --> 00:27:57.410 align:middle line:10%
Look at what the first one
is saying-- "new balance is

00:27:57.410 --> 00:27:59.510 align:middle line:10%
coming to my body now."

00:27:59.510 --> 00:28:01.160 align:middle line:10%
"New balance is coming
to my body now."

00:28:01.160 --> 00:28:02.280 align:middle line:10%
The second one--

00:28:02.280 --> 00:28:04.956 align:middle line:10%
"I'm ready to enjoy
perfect health."

00:28:04.956 --> 00:28:06.200 align:middle line:10%
Or the third one--

00:28:06.200 --> 00:28:10.357 align:middle line:10%
"I am willing to release old
patterns and negative beliefs."

00:28:10.357 --> 00:28:11.690 align:middle line:10%
Let's start with that third one.

00:28:11.690 --> 00:28:14.630 align:middle line:84%
"I'm willing to release old
patterns and negative beliefs."

00:28:14.630 --> 00:28:18.170 align:middle line:84%
If the universe, if the field,
if the matrix is hearing that,

00:28:18.170 --> 00:28:19.550 align:middle line:90%
what is the matrix hearing?

00:28:19.550 --> 00:28:20.810 align:middle line:90%
The matrix is hearing--

00:28:20.810 --> 00:28:22.820 align:middle line:90%
OK, you're ready.

00:28:22.820 --> 00:28:24.050 align:middle line:90%
And you're ready.

00:28:24.050 --> 00:28:25.550 align:middle line:90%
And you're ready.

00:28:25.550 --> 00:28:26.840 align:middle line:90%
But there is no outcome.

00:28:26.840 --> 00:28:28.380 align:middle line:84%
When is it actually
going to happen?

00:28:28.380 --> 00:28:29.810 align:middle line:84%
So the universe says,
OK, you can be ready.

00:28:29.810 --> 00:28:30.500 align:middle line:90%
And you can be ready.

00:28:30.500 --> 00:28:31.375 align:middle line:90%
And you can be ready.

00:28:31.375 --> 00:28:33.750 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't mean that
it's going to happen.

00:28:33.750 --> 00:28:36.470 align:middle line:84%
"I am ready to enjoy perfect
health"-- the same thing.

00:28:36.470 --> 00:28:39.110 align:middle line:84%
The universe says, wow, we're
really glad you're ready.

00:28:39.110 --> 00:28:40.515 align:middle line:90%
That's a good place to be.

00:28:40.515 --> 00:28:42.140 align:middle line:10%
Let us know when you
want it to happen,

00:28:42.140 --> 00:28:44.853 align:middle line:10%
because it's not
in the affirmation.

00:28:44.853 --> 00:28:47.020 align:middle line:10%
The first one-- "new balance
is coming to my body"--

00:28:47.020 --> 00:28:49.600 align:middle line:10%
if you stop there, it
would be open-ended.

00:28:49.600 --> 00:28:53.410 align:middle line:10%
The first one says, "new balance
is coming to my body now."

00:28:53.410 --> 00:28:54.490 align:middle line:10%
So there's an outcome.

00:28:54.490 --> 00:28:56.240 align:middle line:90%
It's happening in the moment.

00:28:56.240 --> 00:28:58.780 align:middle line:84%
Now, you might say
these are subtle

00:28:58.780 --> 00:29:01.920 align:middle line:90%
and that I'm dividing hairs.

00:29:01.920 --> 00:29:05.380 align:middle line:84%
What I want to say to you is
that our words are powerful.

00:29:05.380 --> 00:29:08.500 align:middle line:84%
And our words, as you saw
in the previous episode,

00:29:08.500 --> 00:29:11.050 align:middle line:84%
are the result of
the compression

00:29:11.050 --> 00:29:13.840 align:middle line:84%
of the air within our bodies
to create the acoustic wave

00:29:13.840 --> 00:29:17.230 align:middle line:84%
forms that we emit
into the divine matrix.

00:29:17.230 --> 00:29:18.253 align:middle line:90%
And they have an effect.

00:29:18.253 --> 00:29:20.170 align:middle line:84%
So I'm going to invite
you to think about what

00:29:20.170 --> 00:29:21.295 align:middle line:90%
you're saying to the field.

00:29:21.295 --> 00:29:22.890 align:middle line:84%
What are you saying
to the matrix?

00:29:22.890 --> 00:29:27.670 align:middle line:84%
And where it makes sense, maybe
change up that communication.

00:29:27.670 --> 00:29:29.590 align:middle line:84%
Change up that code
just a little bit.

00:29:29.590 --> 00:29:33.150 align:middle line:90%


00:29:33.150 --> 00:29:35.900 align:middle line:84%
I know what I'm saying to
you is a very different way

00:29:35.900 --> 00:29:36.710 align:middle line:90%
of thinking.

00:29:36.710 --> 00:29:38.600 align:middle line:84%
Once again, it's very
different from the way

00:29:38.600 --> 00:29:40.600 align:middle line:84%
you and I have been led
to think about ourselves

00:29:40.600 --> 00:29:42.660 align:middle line:84%
and our relationship
to the world.

00:29:42.660 --> 00:29:45.020 align:middle line:84%
It's a very different
way for science to think

00:29:45.020 --> 00:29:46.760 align:middle line:90%
about us and our reality.

00:29:46.760 --> 00:29:48.350 align:middle line:90%
But I also know this--

00:29:48.350 --> 00:29:50.990 align:middle line:84%
what I'm saying to you,
what I'm sharing with you--

00:29:50.990 --> 00:29:53.685 align:middle line:84%
the leading-edge discoveries,
the leading-edge research,

00:29:53.685 --> 00:29:55.640 align:middle line:90%
and the rock-solid science--

00:29:55.640 --> 00:30:00.420 align:middle line:84%
it's also the key to the
next step in human evolution.

00:30:00.420 --> 00:30:04.720 align:middle line:84%
We are moving from powerless
victims of life circumstances

00:30:04.720 --> 00:30:09.870 align:middle line:84%
to self-empowered masters of
our own internal technology.

00:30:09.870 --> 00:30:12.210 align:middle line:84%
In the next episode, we'll
discover the technique

00:30:12.210 --> 00:30:14.430 align:middle line:84%
to create an advanced
brain state that

00:30:14.430 --> 00:30:18.178 align:middle line:84%
optimizes our greatest
potential just for such mastery.

00:30:18.178 --> 00:30:20.470 align:middle line:84%
I want to thank you for
joining me for today's program.

00:30:20.470 --> 00:30:23.520 align:middle line:84%
