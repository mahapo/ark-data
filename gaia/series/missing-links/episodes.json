In this inaugural episode, best-selling author Gregg Braden guides us through the cyclic evidence, which charts the simultaneous peaking of economic and, human conflict, and solar system cycles. The rise and fall in each of these cycles holds major implications for our civilization and earth. As all three cycles are beginning to peak, a new story about humanity emerges. For us to understand how this story will unfold, we must first take an honest look at who we really are and where we came from. From the time of our ancestors to modern man, there are deep truths that returning patterns reveal. Bradenâ€™s work involves the idea of fractal patterns, which he developed writing Fractal Time: The Secret of 2012 and a New World Age.","teaser":"In this inaugural episode, Gregg Braden guides us through the evidence which charts the simultaneous peaking of economic, human conflict and solar cycles.

Gregg Braden discusses the various brain states known to science including the newly discovered states which help us to deeply and consciously connect with the Divine Matrix. These new layers of consciousness were discovered by scientists studying the meditation techniques of Tibetan monks. He shares techniques we can use to access the super-enhanced Gamma brain state by harmonizing the neurons in the heart with the neurons in the brain.","teaser":"By harmonizing the neurons in the heart and brain, it is possible to access the Gamma brain state as Tibetan monks have done for centuries.","keyart16x9WithText":{"small":"https://brooklyn.gaia.com/v1/image-render/b2322fdd-735c-4599-8c0b-766a0770ac92/181915_ML_s3e8_Brain-States-for-Accessing-the-Divine-Matrix_16x9.jpg"},"keyart16x9NoText":{"small":"https://brooklyn.gaia.com/v1/image-render/4562a891-b0eb-44b4-8281-a72d193adab9/181915_ML_s3e8_Brain-States-for-Accessing-the-Divine-Matrix_16x9_clean.jpg","medium":"https://brooklyn.gaia.com/v1/image-render/4562a891-b0eb-44b4-8281-a72d193adab9/181915_ML_s3e8_Brain-States-for-Accessing-the-Divine-Matrix_16x9_clean.jpg","large":"https://brooklyn.gaia.com/v1/image-render/4562a891-b0eb-44b4-8281-a72d193adab9/181915_ML_s3e8_Brain-States-for-Accessing-the-Divine-Matrix_16x9_clean.jpg"}},{"seriesId":135476,"seriesTitle":"Missing Links","seriesPath":"series/missing-links","seriesVoteDownCount":1206,"seriesVoteUpCount":21686,"coverartImage":"https://brooklyn.gaia.com/v1/image-render/c5eadfd0-060b-40ef-ad10-40494e32cf4d/181961_ML_s3e9_Manifestation-in-a-Participatory-Reality_cvr.jpg","created":"2019-04-04","episode":12,"classicFacets":{},"fitnessLevel":[],"fitnessStyle":[],"heroImage":"https://brooklyn.gaia.com/v1/image-render/6d5c6143-7fc1-4717-a3ed-38f5492ad88d/181961_ML_s3e9_Manifestation-in-a-Participatory-Reality_16x9.jpg","heroImageNotext":"https://brooklyn.gaia.com/v1/image-render/06a6ca2b-d7da-4e2a-a04f-077f8dd08465/181961_ML_s3e9_Manifestation-in-a-Participatory-Reality_hero-clean.jpg","host":"Gregg Braden","meditationStyle":null,"path":"video/manifestation-participatory-reality","previewImage":"https://brooklyn.gaia.com/v1/image-render/c5eadfd0-060b-40ef-ad10-40494e32cf4d/181961_ML_s3e9_Manifestation-in-a-Participatory-Reality_cvr.jpg","published":true,"season":3,"title":"Manifestation in a Participatory Reality","type":{"content":"video","display":"normal","product":"episode"},"voteDownCount":94,"voteUpCount":3812,"yogaLevel":[],"yogaStyle":[],"episodeCount":42,"seasonCount":3,"preview":{"duration":72,"mediaId":182067,"georestrictions":{"availability":"worldwide","countries":[]},"offerings":{"availability":"free","subscriptions":[]},"id":182067,"isFree":true},"feature":{"duration":1975,"mediaId":182078,"georestrictions":{"availability":"worldwide","countries":[]},"offerings":{"availability":"onlyWith","subscriptions":[253,280,290]},"id":182078,"isFree":false},"id":181961,"isNew":false,"featuredType":null,"body":"Throughout this season, we have learned the power of our thoughts, feelings and emotions for connecting with the Divine Matrix.
