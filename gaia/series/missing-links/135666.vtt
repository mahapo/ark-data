00:00:25.010 --> 00:00:27.740 align:middle line:84%
>> My name is Greg Braden, and
I'd like to welcome you to this

00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:31.550 align:middle line:84%
very special presentation
of "Missing Links,"

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:35.750 align:middle line:84%
the deep truth of our origin,
history, destiny, and fate.

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:38.180 align:middle line:84%
In our last episode,
we identified

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:40.790 align:middle line:84%
the science-based
discovery of a field

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:44.270 align:middle line:84%
of energy, a real-life
matrix, that functions

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:47.330 align:middle line:90%
in three very precise ways.

00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:50.270 align:middle line:84%
This matrix, number
one, it's the container

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:52.700 align:middle line:84%
for the universe itself
and for all things that

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:54.470 align:middle line:90%
can happen in the universe.

00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:57.920 align:middle line:84%
Number two, it's the
bridge between our inner

00:00:57.920 --> 00:00:58.970 align:middle line:90%
and our outer worlds.

00:00:58.970 --> 00:01:02.040 align:middle line:84%
Everything that happens from
within, our thoughts, feelings,

00:01:02.040 --> 00:01:04.489 align:middle line:84%
emotions, and beliefs
are conveyed to the world

00:01:04.489 --> 00:01:06.125 align:middle line:84%
beyond our bodies
through this field.

00:01:06.125 --> 00:01:10.475 align:middle line:84%
And number three, the mirror--
the mirror-- this field

00:01:10.475 --> 00:01:12.770 align:middle line:84%
is a mirror in
the world for what

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:15.650 align:middle line:84%
we claim to be true in
our deepest, sometimes

00:01:15.650 --> 00:01:17.690 align:middle line:90%
subconscious beliefs.

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:20.280 align:middle line:84%
Well, scientists are no
longer asking the question,

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:21.580 align:middle line:90%
are we connected?

00:01:21.580 --> 00:01:23.400 align:middle line:90%
The field tells us that we are.

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:27.050 align:middle line:84%
Now the question is, how
deeply are we connected?

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:30.140 align:middle line:84%
How much influence do we
really have in the world

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:32.090 align:middle line:90%
through this field?

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:35.210 align:middle line:84%
Well, there are two very
futuristic scientific

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:38.780 align:middle line:84%
experiments that take us
light years beyond anything

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:41.405 align:middle line:84%
that we believed in science
as accepted in the past.

00:01:41.405 --> 00:01:43.790 align:middle line:84%
And I want to share
those with you.

00:01:43.790 --> 00:01:47.330 align:middle line:84%
What they are showing,
however, has opened the door

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:52.200 align:middle line:84%
to a possibility that modern
science is now struggling with.

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:55.070 align:middle line:84%
So let's take a look at
these two experiments.

00:01:55.070 --> 00:01:58.700 align:middle line:84%
The first one was published
in the Russian bulletin

00:01:58.700 --> 00:02:02.650 align:middle line:84%
of the Lebedev Physics
Institute in 1992.

00:02:02.650 --> 00:02:06.680 align:middle line:84%
And the experiment begins
with something seemingly very

00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:12.320 align:middle line:84%
innocent-- a glass vessel,
a vase, where all of the air

00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:15.530 align:middle line:84%
has been completely drawn
out of this vessel to create

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:17.570 align:middle line:90%
what we call a vacuum.

00:02:17.570 --> 00:02:21.770 align:middle line:84%
So a vacuum implies that
this vessel is empty,

00:02:21.770 --> 00:02:25.370 align:middle line:84%
but we know it's not completely
empty, because there are still

00:02:25.370 --> 00:02:29.160 align:middle line:84%
little photons of light
that remain in this vessel.

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:31.100 align:middle line:90%
And scientists know this.

00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:34.550 align:middle line:84%
So the question now is,
where are those photons?

00:02:34.550 --> 00:02:38.390 align:middle line:84%
They want to get a baseline and
see where the photons are right

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:39.290 align:middle line:90%
now.

00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:41.090 align:middle line:84%
So the first part
of this experiment,

00:02:41.090 --> 00:02:43.740 align:middle line:84%
they draw the air
out of the vessel,

00:02:43.740 --> 00:02:47.030 align:middle line:84%
and then they measure
where these photons

00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:48.650 align:middle line:90%
are in the vessel.

00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:50.690 align:middle line:84%
Are they all piled
up on the bottom?

00:02:50.690 --> 00:02:52.340 align:middle line:84%
Or are they floating
around the inside?

00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:54.710 align:middle line:84%
Or are they all
stuck to the edges?

00:02:54.710 --> 00:02:57.500 align:middle line:84%
And what they found
was no surprise.

00:02:57.500 --> 00:03:01.887 align:middle line:84%
The vessel showed that these
photons are completely random.

00:03:01.887 --> 00:03:02.970 align:middle line:90%
They're completely random.

00:03:02.970 --> 00:03:05.060 align:middle line:84%
And by the way, these
are the same kinds

00:03:05.060 --> 00:03:07.490 align:middle line:84%
of photons, the
particles of matter,

00:03:07.490 --> 00:03:11.060 align:middle line:84%
that make up the
atom itself that we

00:03:11.060 --> 00:03:12.890 align:middle line:90%
described in the last episode.

00:03:12.890 --> 00:03:16.220 align:middle line:84%
So we're dealing with
these fundamental particles

00:03:16.220 --> 00:03:18.200 align:middle line:84%
of the stuff that
our world is made of.

00:03:18.200 --> 00:03:19.820 align:middle line:90%
And that's important.

00:03:19.820 --> 00:03:22.670 align:middle line:84%
So the scientists found
that the distribution

00:03:22.670 --> 00:03:26.310 align:middle line:84%
of the photons in this vessel
was completely random--

00:03:26.310 --> 00:03:27.110 align:middle line:90%
no surprise.

00:03:27.110 --> 00:03:29.520 align:middle line:90%
That's what they expected.

00:03:29.520 --> 00:03:32.220 align:middle line:84%
The next piece of
this experiment

00:03:32.220 --> 00:03:36.650 align:middle line:84%
is where, while the
experiment is fascinating,

00:03:36.650 --> 00:03:38.970 align:middle line:84%
what I find really
fascinating is

00:03:38.970 --> 00:03:40.500 align:middle line:84%
the thinking of
the scientists that

00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:42.780 align:middle line:90%
made the experiment possible.

00:03:42.780 --> 00:03:46.440 align:middle line:84%
For a scientist trained in
the scientific method based

00:03:46.440 --> 00:03:48.630 align:middle line:84%
upon all of those
false assumptions

00:03:48.630 --> 00:03:51.540 align:middle line:84%
that we saw earlier in this
program, those assumptions

00:03:51.540 --> 00:03:54.930 align:middle line:84%
of separation,
for the scientists

00:03:54.930 --> 00:03:58.200 align:middle line:84%
to move out of that
box of thinking

00:03:58.200 --> 00:04:00.780 align:middle line:84%
and begin asking
new questions like,

00:04:00.780 --> 00:04:02.760 align:middle line:84%
what if our
assumptions are wrong?

00:04:02.760 --> 00:04:04.740 align:middle line:84%
What would that tell
us about our world?

00:04:04.740 --> 00:04:06.660 align:middle line:84%
That's where it gets
really interesting,

00:04:06.660 --> 00:04:09.990 align:middle line:84%
and that's what the next part
of this experiment is all about.

00:04:09.990 --> 00:04:14.490 align:middle line:84%
Because what the scientists
did was, into the vessel

00:04:14.490 --> 00:04:17.100 align:middle line:84%
that had completely
random photons,

00:04:17.100 --> 00:04:21.600 align:middle line:90%
they put human DNA-- human DNA.

00:04:21.600 --> 00:04:25.410 align:middle line:84%
Because they wanted
to see if human DNA

00:04:25.410 --> 00:04:27.320 align:middle line:90%
has an effect on the photons.

00:04:27.320 --> 00:04:28.980 align:middle line:84%
And before I go
any further, I just

00:04:28.980 --> 00:04:31.410 align:middle line:84%
would invite you to think
about what they're asking.

00:04:31.410 --> 00:04:35.550 align:middle line:84%
Photons are the stuff
this world is made of.

00:04:35.550 --> 00:04:38.580 align:middle line:90%
DNA is the stuff we're made of.

00:04:38.580 --> 00:04:42.540 align:middle line:84%
And scientists are
asking in the laboratory,

00:04:42.540 --> 00:04:44.730 align:middle line:84%
does this stuff
we're made of have

00:04:44.730 --> 00:04:47.850 align:middle line:84%
an effect on this stuff
our world is made of?

00:04:47.850 --> 00:04:50.790 align:middle line:84%
This is where it starts to
sound like science fiction,

00:04:50.790 --> 00:04:53.130 align:middle line:84%
or at least something that
an advanced yogi would

00:04:53.130 --> 00:04:54.630 align:middle line:90%
be working with.

00:04:54.630 --> 00:04:58.710 align:middle line:84%
But these are in a bonafide
scientific laboratory,

00:04:58.710 --> 00:04:59.530 align:middle line:90%
these questions.

00:04:59.530 --> 00:05:00.970 align:middle line:84%
This is where
they're being asked.

00:05:00.970 --> 00:05:02.680 align:middle line:90%
So here's what they did.

00:05:02.680 --> 00:05:07.360 align:middle line:84%
They took human DNA, and they
placed it inside the vessel.

00:05:07.360 --> 00:05:12.040 align:middle line:84%
And then they measured the DNA
again to see what would happen.

00:05:12.040 --> 00:05:15.940 align:middle line:84%
And they measured the photons
again to see what would happen.

00:05:15.940 --> 00:05:17.820 align:middle line:84%
And the results
of this experiment

00:05:17.820 --> 00:05:21.000 align:middle line:84%
changed the way we had
been conditioned to think

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:23.100 align:middle line:90%
about ourselves and the world.

00:05:23.100 --> 00:05:26.190 align:middle line:84%
Because the photons went from
being completely random when

00:05:26.190 --> 00:05:30.660 align:middle line:84%
they were first measured, and in
the presence of the human DNA,

00:05:30.660 --> 00:05:33.420 align:middle line:84%
the photons are
no longer random.

00:05:33.420 --> 00:05:34.950 align:middle line:90%
They are ordered.

00:05:34.950 --> 00:05:39.600 align:middle line:84%
They followed precisely
the geometry of the DNA.

00:05:39.600 --> 00:05:43.590 align:middle line:84%
The DNA was having a direct
effect on the photons.

00:05:43.590 --> 00:05:47.250 align:middle line:84%
The stuff we're made of
is having a direct effect

00:05:47.250 --> 00:05:51.180 align:middle line:84%
on the stuff our world is made
of, just like some of our most

00:05:51.180 --> 00:05:54.720 align:middle line:84%
ancient and cherished indigenous
and spiritual traditions have

00:05:54.720 --> 00:05:59.340 align:middle line:84%
always told us, that we
are connected to the world.

00:05:59.340 --> 00:06:01.380 align:middle line:90%
So this is the first experiment.

00:06:01.380 --> 00:06:04.980 align:middle line:84%
Human DNA has a
measurable effect

00:06:04.980 --> 00:06:06.450 align:middle line:84%
on the stuff our
world is made of.

00:06:06.450 --> 00:06:09.430 align:middle line:84%
And I want you to see the
way the scientists responded

00:06:09.430 --> 00:06:10.230 align:middle line:90%
to this.

00:06:10.230 --> 00:06:11.980 align:middle line:10%
So I'm going to read
this to you directly.

00:06:11.980 --> 00:06:16.230 align:middle line:10%
In the journal "Nanobiology,"
and this was published in 1995,

00:06:16.230 --> 00:06:18.660 align:middle line:10%
the way the scientists
describe this,

00:06:18.660 --> 00:06:23.310 align:middle line:10%
they said that the photons
were described as behaving--

00:06:23.310 --> 00:06:26.010 align:middle line:10%
and this is a
quote-- "surprisingly

00:06:26.010 --> 00:06:30.270 align:middle line:10%
and counterintuitively"--
counterintuitively.

00:06:30.270 --> 00:06:33.480 align:middle line:10%
It's counterintuitive because
the scientific thinking

00:06:33.480 --> 00:06:35.850 align:middle line:10%
is that everything is
separate from everything else

00:06:35.850 --> 00:06:39.510 align:middle line:10%
and there is no stuff
to convey any effect

00:06:39.510 --> 00:06:40.920 align:middle line:10%
from the DNA to the matter.

00:06:40.920 --> 00:06:43.380 align:middle line:84%
That's why it's
counterintuitive to the science.

00:06:43.380 --> 00:06:47.010 align:middle line:84%
But the next piece is what I
find particularly interesting.

00:06:47.010 --> 00:06:49.360 align:middle line:10%
I'm going to invite you
to listen to the language.

00:06:49.360 --> 00:06:54.900 align:middle line:10%
It says, "We are forced to
accept the possibility"--

00:06:54.900 --> 00:06:56.400 align:middle line:10%
they're saying that
they are forced.

00:06:56.400 --> 00:06:58.770 align:middle line:10%
They're not saying "it looks
like," or "it appears,"

00:06:58.770 --> 00:07:00.420 align:middle line:10%
or "this is what we've found."

00:07:00.420 --> 00:07:04.020 align:middle line:10%
They're saying "we are forced
to accept the possibility

00:07:04.020 --> 00:07:10.440 align:middle line:10%
that some new field of energy
is being excited by the DNA."

00:07:10.440 --> 00:07:12.330 align:middle line:84%
Well, I think we know
it's not a new field.

00:07:12.330 --> 00:07:15.000 align:middle line:84%
It's a field that's
been around a long time.

00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:19.210 align:middle line:84%
It's simply that we are just
now recognizing that field

00:07:19.210 --> 00:07:21.210 align:middle line:90%
and what it means to us.

00:07:21.210 --> 00:07:24.690 align:middle line:84%
So the summary of
this second experiment

00:07:24.690 --> 00:07:30.180 align:middle line:84%
is that science now confirms
that human DNA influences

00:07:30.180 --> 00:07:33.960 align:middle line:84%
the stuff our world is
made of through the photons

00:07:33.960 --> 00:07:37.560 align:middle line:84%
by communicating directly
through the field.

00:07:37.560 --> 00:07:39.070 align:middle line:90%
That's a big piece.

00:07:39.070 --> 00:07:42.510 align:middle line:84%
But now let me go to
the second experiment.

00:07:42.510 --> 00:07:45.330 align:middle line:84%
This experiment was published
in the "Journal of Scientific

00:07:45.330 --> 00:07:49.850 align:middle line:90%
Exploration" in 1994.

00:07:49.850 --> 00:07:54.160 align:middle line:84%
It begins with human
DNA once again.

00:07:54.160 --> 00:07:57.770 align:middle line:84%
And this is a very
precise kind of human DNA.

00:07:57.770 --> 00:08:02.510 align:middle line:84%
It comes from umbilical
cords of newborns,

00:08:02.510 --> 00:08:07.670 align:middle line:84%
because that DNA is what's
called very pristine DNA.

00:08:07.670 --> 00:08:10.700 align:middle line:84%
It hasn't been eroded
over time, as happens

00:08:10.700 --> 00:08:12.250 align:middle line:90%
as we mature in life.

00:08:12.250 --> 00:08:15.470 align:middle line:84%
So it's a very
pristine kind of DNA.

00:08:15.470 --> 00:08:19.650 align:middle line:84%
And the DNA is
isolated in one vessel,

00:08:19.650 --> 00:08:21.800 align:middle line:84%
and that is encased
in another vessel

00:08:21.800 --> 00:08:24.830 align:middle line:84%
to make sure that there are
no other influences that

00:08:24.830 --> 00:08:29.750 align:middle line:84%
are happening from outside
to influence the DNA.

00:08:29.750 --> 00:08:32.480 align:middle line:10%
So here is the experiment.

00:08:32.480 --> 00:08:36.530 align:middle line:10%
This very unique
DNA is now placed

00:08:36.530 --> 00:08:41.150 align:middle line:10%
within the range of the
field of a human heart

00:08:41.150 --> 00:08:43.760 align:middle line:10%
that we described in
an earlier episode.

00:08:43.760 --> 00:08:45.830 align:middle line:84%
Every human heart,
if you recall,

00:08:45.830 --> 00:08:47.600 align:middle line:84%
has a field of
energy that extends

00:08:47.600 --> 00:08:50.990 align:middle line:84%
beyond the physical heart
for a distance between five

00:08:50.990 --> 00:08:52.580 align:middle line:90%
to eight feet.

00:08:52.580 --> 00:08:56.110 align:middle line:84%
And that field is an
electrical and a magnetic field

00:08:56.110 --> 00:08:59.060 align:middle line:84%
that we can measure with
conventional equipment.

00:08:59.060 --> 00:09:03.050 align:middle line:84%
So the question is,
through that field,

00:09:03.050 --> 00:09:09.350 align:middle line:84%
is the DNA influenced by the
emotions of another person?

00:09:09.350 --> 00:09:12.500 align:middle line:84%
Can our emotions
actually influence

00:09:12.500 --> 00:09:14.636 align:middle line:90%
the DNA in our bodies?

00:09:14.636 --> 00:09:16.010 align:middle line:84%
Before I tell you
the experiment,

00:09:16.010 --> 00:09:20.030 align:middle line:84%
let me just share a little bit
about why this is important.

00:09:20.030 --> 00:09:23.930 align:middle line:84%
Human DNA, when it
is in our cells,

00:09:23.930 --> 00:09:27.890 align:middle line:84%
it is coiled in very
specific kinds of ways.

00:09:27.890 --> 00:09:30.380 align:middle line:84%
And what scientists
have found is

00:09:30.380 --> 00:09:33.680 align:middle line:84%
that in the presence
of certain emotions

00:09:33.680 --> 00:09:36.020 align:middle line:84%
that we would call
negative emotions--

00:09:36.020 --> 00:09:38.310 align:middle line:84%
and I don't really
like to use that term,

00:09:38.310 --> 00:09:41.210 align:middle line:84%
but I'm going to use it to be
clear what we're talking about.

00:09:41.210 --> 00:09:44.720 align:middle line:84%
So when we talk about
emotions, for example,

00:09:44.720 --> 00:09:49.220 align:middle line:84%
of anger or hate or jealousy
or rage or frustration, those

00:09:49.220 --> 00:09:52.470 align:middle line:84%
that we would typically
consider as negative emotions,

00:09:52.470 --> 00:09:56.140 align:middle line:84%
they have an effect on
the DNA within our bodies.

00:09:56.140 --> 00:10:00.230 align:middle line:84%
And the effect is that in the
presence of those emotions,

00:10:00.230 --> 00:10:03.170 align:middle line:84%
the DNA is actually--
coil is tightened.

00:10:03.170 --> 00:10:05.510 align:middle line:84%
It's tightened
like a little knot.

00:10:05.510 --> 00:10:07.760 align:middle line:84%
And that's important,
because when

00:10:07.760 --> 00:10:12.020 align:middle line:84%
it is tightened in this way,
the DNA does not express

00:10:12.020 --> 00:10:14.180 align:middle line:90%
to its fullest capacity.

00:10:14.180 --> 00:10:17.810 align:middle line:84%
So negative emotions
tighten the coil

00:10:17.810 --> 00:10:20.600 align:middle line:84%
and prevent the
DNA from expressing

00:10:20.600 --> 00:10:23.300 align:middle line:84%
the fullest capacity of whatever
it is that it is expressing.

00:10:23.300 --> 00:10:26.930 align:middle line:84%
Whether it's our immune response
or our anti-aging hormones

00:10:26.930 --> 00:10:31.220 align:middle line:84%
or whatever it is, the DNA
simply cannot do its full

00:10:31.220 --> 00:10:33.890 align:middle line:84%
complement of what
it's designed to do.

00:10:33.890 --> 00:10:35.780 align:middle line:84%
So from this description,
you can probably

00:10:35.780 --> 00:10:38.210 align:middle line:84%
imagine what the
positive emotions do.

00:10:38.210 --> 00:10:42.190 align:middle line:84%
Positive emotions
actually loosen the DNA.

00:10:42.190 --> 00:10:44.660 align:middle line:90%
They relax the DNA.

00:10:44.660 --> 00:10:50.150 align:middle line:84%
So these are the emotions
of compassion, gratitude,

00:10:50.150 --> 00:10:51.980 align:middle line:90%
appreciation, for example.

00:10:51.980 --> 00:10:57.410 align:middle line:84%
Those kinds of emotions actually
relax the DNA within our bodies

00:10:57.410 --> 00:11:00.290 align:middle line:84%
and allow that
fullest expression.

00:11:00.290 --> 00:11:02.810 align:middle line:84%
Knowing this, the
scientists wanted

00:11:02.810 --> 00:11:07.520 align:middle line:84%
to see what effect human
emotion from one person

00:11:07.520 --> 00:11:12.120 align:middle line:84%
would have upon DNA that's
not in that person's body,

00:11:12.120 --> 00:11:14.360 align:middle line:84%
but it's in this special
container that was designed.

00:11:14.360 --> 00:11:16.370 align:middle line:90%
So that's the experiment.

00:11:16.370 --> 00:11:17.720 align:middle line:90%
Here's what they found.

00:11:17.720 --> 00:11:20.150 align:middle line:90%
The human DNA was isolated.

00:11:20.150 --> 00:11:24.032 align:middle line:10%
And in the presence of
the positive emotions,

00:11:24.032 --> 00:11:26.240 align:middle line:10%
in the presence of the
gratitude, appreciation, love,

00:11:26.240 --> 00:11:28.640 align:middle line:10%
and compassion,
what happened was

00:11:28.640 --> 00:11:35.390 align:middle line:10%
the DNA actually began to
relax, and it relaxed so much

00:11:35.390 --> 00:11:38.510 align:middle line:10%
that it began to unwind itself.

00:11:38.510 --> 00:11:43.910 align:middle line:84%
The two coils began to
unwind, as if the DNA

00:11:43.910 --> 00:11:49.640 align:middle line:84%
was about to replicate itself
and produce a new strand of DNA

00:11:49.640 --> 00:11:52.580 align:middle line:84%
in the presence of
positive emotion.

00:11:52.580 --> 00:11:58.350 align:middle line:84%
All that was happening was
gratitude, appreciation, care,

00:11:58.350 --> 00:12:00.890 align:middle line:84%
compassion, and the
DNA was responding

00:12:00.890 --> 00:12:06.080 align:middle line:84%
in such a positive manner
that the DNA acted, again,

00:12:06.080 --> 00:12:09.350 align:middle line:84%
as if it was about
to reproduce itself

00:12:09.350 --> 00:12:13.820 align:middle line:84%
in a new, vitalized,
healed state.

00:12:13.820 --> 00:12:17.450 align:middle line:84%
So this is something that
scientists were not expecting.

00:12:17.450 --> 00:12:21.410 align:middle line:84%
So now we've seen the results
of these two experiments.

00:12:21.410 --> 00:12:25.580 align:middle line:84%
In the presence of the positive
emotion, the DNA is relaxed.

00:12:25.580 --> 00:12:27.890 align:middle line:84%
In the presence of
negative emotions,

00:12:27.890 --> 00:12:31.250 align:middle line:84%
such as anger, hate,
jealousy, rage,

00:12:31.250 --> 00:12:34.220 align:middle line:84%
the DNA was tightened
like a little knot.

00:12:34.220 --> 00:12:36.800 align:middle line:90%
It coiled up very, very tightly.

00:12:36.800 --> 00:12:39.890 align:middle line:84%
And this is telling the
scientists something

00:12:39.890 --> 00:12:43.190 align:middle line:84%
that we've never seen
demonstrated under laboratory

00:12:43.190 --> 00:12:44.150 align:middle line:90%
conditions before.

00:12:44.150 --> 00:12:47.420 align:middle line:84%
Anecdotally, it may
have been suspected.

00:12:47.420 --> 00:12:51.740 align:middle line:84%
But this is the first time
in a laboratory environment

00:12:51.740 --> 00:12:56.810 align:middle line:84%
that we could actually see human
emotion, intentionally created

00:12:56.810 --> 00:13:00.530 align:middle line:84%
by those trained to create
very specific kinds and very

00:13:00.530 --> 00:13:04.820 align:middle line:84%
specific qualities of emotion,
that human emotion changed

00:13:04.820 --> 00:13:07.070 align:middle line:90%
the shape of the DNA.

00:13:07.070 --> 00:13:10.250 align:middle line:84%
It changed the
ability of the DNA

00:13:10.250 --> 00:13:14.090 align:middle line:84%
to fully express the full
complement of what it is,

00:13:14.090 --> 00:13:15.857 align:middle line:90%
whatever that DNA is expressing.

00:13:15.857 --> 00:13:17.690 align:middle line:84%
So I'm going to share
with you now directly.

00:13:17.690 --> 00:13:20.540 align:middle line:10%
I want you to hear from
the scientists, quote,

00:13:20.540 --> 00:13:25.820 align:middle line:10%
"Individuals trained in feelings
of deep love and appreciation

00:13:25.820 --> 00:13:28.550 align:middle line:10%
were able to
intentionally change

00:13:28.550 --> 00:13:32.120 align:middle line:10%
the shape of the DNA
in their bodies."

00:13:32.120 --> 00:13:36.440 align:middle line:84%
And they went on to say
that "human emotion produces

00:13:36.440 --> 00:13:41.686 align:middle line:84%
effects which defy
conventional laws of physics."

00:13:41.686 --> 00:13:44.230 align:middle line:84%
Now, what are those
results saying to us?

00:13:44.230 --> 00:13:50.630 align:middle line:10%
It's saying that when we embrace
the deepest truth, the power

00:13:50.630 --> 00:13:52.910 align:middle line:10%
that is available to us,
when we tap the fullest

00:13:52.910 --> 00:13:55.790 align:middle line:10%
potential that we
have available to us,

00:13:55.790 --> 00:13:59.970 align:middle line:10%
that we are not bound by the
conventional laws of physics,

00:13:59.970 --> 00:14:03.530 align:middle line:10%
at least as we have known
those laws in the past.

00:14:03.530 --> 00:14:06.060 align:middle line:10%
Maybe the laws of physics
are going to change.

00:14:06.060 --> 00:14:10.970 align:middle line:84%
But the fact that we have the
ability to feel a certain way,

00:14:10.970 --> 00:14:12.860 align:middle line:84%
to create a certain
emotion in our body

00:14:12.860 --> 00:14:16.580 align:middle line:84%
and literally change
the DNA within us

00:14:16.580 --> 00:14:20.420 align:middle line:84%
and, in the case of experiment,
that was not even part of us,

00:14:20.420 --> 00:14:23.390 align:middle line:90%
that tells a new story.

00:14:23.390 --> 00:14:25.057 align:middle line:84%
And here's what this
story is all about.

00:14:25.057 --> 00:14:27.348 align:middle line:84%
So I'm going to invite you
now to think about these two

00:14:27.348 --> 00:14:28.205 align:middle line:90%
experiments.

00:14:28.205 --> 00:14:31.820 align:middle line:84%
The first experiment,
human emotion

00:14:31.820 --> 00:14:35.300 align:middle line:84%
changes the shape of the
DNA, and you saw that.

00:14:35.300 --> 00:14:40.340 align:middle line:84%
The second experiment is that
DNA changes physical matter.

00:14:40.340 --> 00:14:44.610 align:middle line:84%
The DNA influenced the photons
that were in the vessel.

00:14:44.610 --> 00:14:48.200 align:middle line:84%
If you take out the middle
piece, human emotion changes

00:14:48.200 --> 00:14:52.430 align:middle line:84%
DNA, DNA changes matter, if
you take out the overlapping

00:14:52.430 --> 00:14:57.110 align:middle line:84%
statements of DNA, what we find
is this-- human emotion changes

00:14:57.110 --> 00:14:58.100 align:middle line:90%
matter.

00:14:58.100 --> 00:15:03.770 align:middle line:84%
Human emotion influences the
stuff our world is made of.

00:15:03.770 --> 00:15:08.750 align:middle line:84%
And as we learn to embrace
the qualities of feeling

00:15:08.750 --> 00:15:12.110 align:middle line:84%
and emotion that change
the DNA in our bodies,

00:15:12.110 --> 00:15:14.840 align:middle line:84%
not only does it influence
the healing in our own bodies,

00:15:14.840 --> 00:15:17.180 align:middle line:84%
as you'll see in
future episodes,

00:15:17.180 --> 00:15:20.630 align:middle line:84%
not only does it influence
the DNA in additional ways,

00:15:20.630 --> 00:15:22.520 align:middle line:84%
as you're going to see
in future episodes,

00:15:22.520 --> 00:15:26.240 align:middle line:84%
it literally taps, it
influences the stuff

00:15:26.240 --> 00:15:30.230 align:middle line:84%
our world is made of in ways
that sound superhuman, that

00:15:30.230 --> 00:15:32.330 align:middle line:84%
sounds like something
that a yogi studying

00:15:32.330 --> 00:15:34.520 align:middle line:84%
in a monastery on a
high mountaintop half

00:15:34.520 --> 00:15:37.460 align:middle line:84%
a world away for a lifetime
would be able to do.

00:15:37.460 --> 00:15:39.206 align:middle line:84%
But the beauty of
these experiments

00:15:39.206 --> 00:15:40.580 align:middle line:84%
is that we don't
have to do that.

00:15:40.580 --> 00:15:42.837 align:middle line:84%
We don't have to leave
everything that we love

00:15:42.837 --> 00:15:44.420 align:middle line:84%
and all the people
and the experiences

00:15:44.420 --> 00:15:46.460 align:middle line:84%
and live in a monastery
on the mountaintop

00:15:46.460 --> 00:15:50.480 align:middle line:84%
for a lifetime or two to embrace
what these technologies are all

00:15:50.480 --> 00:15:51.280 align:middle line:90%
about.

00:15:51.280 --> 00:15:53.980 align:middle line:84%
And this is precisely
what we are talking about.

00:15:53.980 --> 00:15:55.840 align:middle line:90%
This is a technology.

00:15:55.840 --> 00:15:59.020 align:middle line:84%
It is an internal
technology that

00:15:59.020 --> 00:16:02.260 align:middle line:84%
is available to every
human if we choose

00:16:02.260 --> 00:16:04.580 align:middle line:90%
to embrace it in our lives.

00:16:04.580 --> 00:16:07.540 align:middle line:84%
So what have we learned
from these experiments?

00:16:07.540 --> 00:16:11.350 align:middle line:84%
We now know, science
confirms, human emotion

00:16:11.350 --> 00:16:15.130 align:middle line:84%
influences the field
that connects all things

00:16:15.130 --> 00:16:18.190 align:middle line:84%
and the stuff our
world is made of.

00:16:18.190 --> 00:16:21.130 align:middle line:84%
When we study physics,
traditional physics,

00:16:21.130 --> 00:16:25.840 align:middle line:84%
one of the great mysteries of
the physics as we know it today

00:16:25.840 --> 00:16:30.310 align:middle line:84%
has to do with the outcome
of yet another experiment.

00:16:30.310 --> 00:16:34.300 align:middle line:84%
This experiment was
first performed in 1909,

00:16:34.300 --> 00:16:36.580 align:middle line:90%
at the turn of the 20th century.

00:16:36.580 --> 00:16:38.830 align:middle line:84%
And at that time, the
scientists didn't know what

00:16:38.830 --> 00:16:40.720 align:middle line:90%
to make of this experiment.

00:16:40.720 --> 00:16:45.040 align:middle line:84%
Prior to 1909, physics
was mechanistic.

00:16:45.040 --> 00:16:48.190 align:middle line:84%
They're called Newtonian
physics, classical physics.

00:16:48.190 --> 00:16:50.410 align:middle line:84%
It was all about
things bumping up

00:16:50.410 --> 00:16:55.840 align:middle line:84%
against other things, electrons
and atoms and neutrons.

00:16:55.840 --> 00:16:58.334 align:middle line:84%
But the new physics that
was developing at the time

00:16:58.334 --> 00:17:00.250 align:middle line:84%
through the theories
that were being developed

00:17:00.250 --> 00:17:03.220 align:middle line:84%
in the late 1800s
and early 1900s,

00:17:03.220 --> 00:17:05.770 align:middle line:84%
that physics said that
there's something else that's

00:17:05.770 --> 00:17:08.560 align:middle line:84%
happening that on the level
of things that are very small

00:17:08.560 --> 00:17:13.390 align:middle line:84%
and the level of things that are
very huge, in terms of galaxies

00:17:13.390 --> 00:17:17.319 align:middle line:84%
and in terms of very,
very small particles,

00:17:17.319 --> 00:17:19.300 align:middle line:84%
there's another
physics that's working.

00:17:19.300 --> 00:17:21.460 align:middle line:90%
That's the quantum physics.

00:17:21.460 --> 00:17:23.780 align:middle line:84%
And the experiment
that I'm talking about

00:17:23.780 --> 00:17:27.790 align:middle line:84%
was known as the very,
very famous double slit

00:17:27.790 --> 00:17:30.770 align:middle line:90%
experiment, performed in 1909.

00:17:30.770 --> 00:17:34.270 align:middle line:84%
And the mystery is
because the result

00:17:34.270 --> 00:17:37.810 align:middle line:84%
of the double-slit
experiment actually

00:17:37.810 --> 00:17:41.380 align:middle line:84%
is determined by
whether or not someone

00:17:41.380 --> 00:17:44.784 align:middle line:90%
is watching the experiment, OK?

00:17:44.784 --> 00:17:45.700 align:middle line:90%
Let me say that again.

00:17:45.700 --> 00:17:47.620 align:middle line:84%
Let me tell you how
this experiment works.

00:17:47.620 --> 00:17:53.290 align:middle line:84%
The double-slit experiment
begins as a beam of photons.

00:17:53.290 --> 00:17:55.390 align:middle line:90%
And you see a common theme here.

00:17:55.390 --> 00:17:56.980 align:middle line:90%
We're talking about photons.

00:17:56.980 --> 00:18:00.790 align:middle line:84%
They are the elementary
stuff that atoms are made of,

00:18:00.790 --> 00:18:02.380 align:middle line:84%
the stuff our world
is made of you.

00:18:02.380 --> 00:18:04.330 align:middle line:90%
You and I are made of photons.

00:18:04.330 --> 00:18:05.620 align:middle line:90%
Our world is made of photons.

00:18:05.620 --> 00:18:08.290 align:middle line:84%
So it's not surprising that
they would be used a lot

00:18:08.290 --> 00:18:10.340 align:middle line:90%
throughout these experiments.

00:18:10.340 --> 00:18:15.100 align:middle line:84%
So in the double-slit
experiment, a beam of light,

00:18:15.100 --> 00:18:21.100 align:middle line:84%
photons, particles of light,
was fired from a device.

00:18:21.100 --> 00:18:24.190 align:middle line:90%
And it was fired at a barrier.

00:18:24.190 --> 00:18:28.630 align:middle line:84%
And the barrier had two
slits on either side.

00:18:28.630 --> 00:18:30.610 align:middle line:84%
And what scientists
expected to see

00:18:30.610 --> 00:18:34.000 align:middle line:84%
was that once the
light hit the barrier,

00:18:34.000 --> 00:18:37.180 align:middle line:84%
it would go through
both of the slits,

00:18:37.180 --> 00:18:39.700 align:middle line:84%
and we would be able to
see the patterns that

00:18:39.700 --> 00:18:44.150 align:middle line:84%
was creating in a very
expected way on the other side.

00:18:44.150 --> 00:18:46.940 align:middle line:84%
Well, this is where
the mystery comes in.

00:18:46.940 --> 00:18:49.480 align:middle line:84%
Because what scientists
found is that when

00:18:49.480 --> 00:18:54.610 align:middle line:84%
the light hit the barrier
and it went through

00:18:54.610 --> 00:18:57.970 align:middle line:84%
and it was being observed--
now, the observer

00:18:57.970 --> 00:18:59.080 align:middle line:90%
could be another human.

00:18:59.080 --> 00:19:01.480 align:middle line:84%
It could be a
device watching it.

00:19:01.480 --> 00:19:05.500 align:middle line:84%
But somehow, the
observation actually

00:19:05.500 --> 00:19:10.330 align:middle line:84%
determined how those particles
of light would behave.

00:19:10.330 --> 00:19:13.540 align:middle line:84%
When no one and
nothing was observing,

00:19:13.540 --> 00:19:16.000 align:middle line:84%
the particles would
behave in one way.

00:19:16.000 --> 00:19:19.900 align:middle line:84%
When someone or a
gadget was recording,

00:19:19.900 --> 00:19:22.660 align:middle line:84%
the particles would
behave in another way.

00:19:22.660 --> 00:19:24.040 align:middle line:90%
And here's the difference.

00:19:24.040 --> 00:19:26.080 align:middle line:84%
Under one set of
circumstances, the particles

00:19:26.080 --> 00:19:26.880 align:middle line:90%
remained particles.

00:19:26.880 --> 00:19:28.860 align:middle line:84%
Under another set
of circumstances,

00:19:28.860 --> 00:19:31.510 align:middle line:90%
the particles became waves.

00:19:31.510 --> 00:19:34.120 align:middle line:84%
So now we're
talking on a quantum

00:19:34.120 --> 00:19:36.880 align:middle line:84%
level about the difference
between the particles

00:19:36.880 --> 00:19:37.900 align:middle line:90%
and waves.

00:19:37.900 --> 00:19:41.930 align:middle line:84%
It's the same energy expressing
in very, very different forms.

00:19:41.930 --> 00:19:43.970 align:middle line:84%
Now, this is going to
be really important,

00:19:43.970 --> 00:19:46.720 align:middle line:84%
because what we
have just done is

00:19:46.720 --> 00:19:49.330 align:middle line:84%
we've talked about
the ability of humans

00:19:49.330 --> 00:19:52.300 align:middle line:84%
to create the emotion
that influences their DNA

00:19:52.300 --> 00:19:55.690 align:middle line:84%
and influences the stuff
our world is made of.

00:19:55.690 --> 00:19:58.900 align:middle line:84%
And now we're talking about
the stuff our world is

00:19:58.900 --> 00:20:02.050 align:middle line:84%
made of behaves differently--
sometimes it's a particle,

00:20:02.050 --> 00:20:04.660 align:middle line:84%
sometimes it's a wave--
depending on whether or not

00:20:04.660 --> 00:20:06.310 align:middle line:90%
it's being observed.

00:20:06.310 --> 00:20:12.160 align:middle line:84%
The implications for healing,
the implications for prayer,

00:20:12.160 --> 00:20:17.020 align:middle line:84%
the implications
for remote healing

00:20:17.020 --> 00:20:19.780 align:middle line:84%
within the context
of these discoveries

00:20:19.780 --> 00:20:21.790 align:middle line:90%
take on a whole new meaning.

00:20:21.790 --> 00:20:25.690 align:middle line:84%
And if you think about
this, we know scientifically

00:20:25.690 --> 00:20:28.040 align:middle line:90%
that prayer has an effect.

00:20:28.040 --> 00:20:30.050 align:middle line:84%
Many studies have been
done, and the question

00:20:30.050 --> 00:20:33.187 align:middle line:84%
was, how could a prayer in
one person's living room

00:20:33.187 --> 00:20:35.770 align:middle line:84%
for their loved one, their son
or their daughter, their mother

00:20:35.770 --> 00:20:39.520 align:middle line:84%
or father in a battlefield of
Afghanistan half a world away,

00:20:39.520 --> 00:20:43.530 align:middle line:84%
how could the prayer have any
influence on the other side

00:20:43.530 --> 00:20:44.330 align:middle line:90%
of the planet?

00:20:44.330 --> 00:20:46.420 align:middle line:90%
And yet it does statistically.

00:20:46.420 --> 00:20:48.340 align:middle line:84%
What the studies
were showing was

00:20:48.340 --> 00:20:51.400 align:middle line:84%
that people fared better
when they were ill

00:20:51.400 --> 00:20:53.020 align:middle line:84%
or when they
underwent a surgery.

00:20:53.020 --> 00:20:55.270 align:middle line:84%
Those that had people praying
for them fared better,

00:20:55.270 --> 00:20:58.090 align:middle line:84%
recovered faster, had less
trauma, less bleeding,

00:20:58.090 --> 00:21:00.870 align:middle line:84%
less swelling, less bruising
than those that did not.

00:21:00.870 --> 00:21:03.219 align:middle line:84%
These are very, very
well documented studies.

00:21:03.219 --> 00:21:05.260 align:middle line:84%
So I'm not going to spend
a lot of time on those.

00:21:05.260 --> 00:21:07.670 align:middle line:84%
The question is,
why does it happen?

00:21:07.670 --> 00:21:08.930 align:middle line:90%
How does it happen?

00:21:08.930 --> 00:21:10.420 align:middle line:84%
That's what we're
spending time on.

00:21:10.420 --> 00:21:12.740 align:middle line:84%
Because we're going to take
us now to the next level.

00:21:12.740 --> 00:21:14.920 align:middle line:84%
We're going to take it
even further than we

00:21:14.920 --> 00:21:16.060 align:middle line:90%
have in the past.

00:21:16.060 --> 00:21:18.040 align:middle line:84%
Because it begins
to tie into what

00:21:18.040 --> 00:21:21.340 align:middle line:84%
we have called
"miracles" in the past.

00:21:21.340 --> 00:21:25.690 align:middle line:84%
A miracle is only a miracle
until we understand the science

00:21:25.690 --> 00:21:27.420 align:middle line:90%
underlying what's happening.

00:21:27.420 --> 00:21:29.560 align:middle line:90%
Then it becomes a technology.

00:21:29.560 --> 00:21:33.940 align:middle line:84%
And it's something that we
all have available to us.

00:21:33.940 --> 00:21:36.160 align:middle line:84%
Although the observer
effect was first

00:21:36.160 --> 00:21:39.130 align:middle line:84%
documented during the first
double-slit experiments

00:21:39.130 --> 00:21:41.230 align:middle line:90%
early in the 20th century.

00:21:41.230 --> 00:21:44.740 align:middle line:84%
As happens so often with these
very important experiments,

00:21:44.740 --> 00:21:48.040 align:middle line:84%
this particular experiment was
repeated later in the century,

00:21:48.040 --> 00:21:50.170 align:middle line:84%
using even better
equipment with new ideas

00:21:50.170 --> 00:21:51.790 align:middle line:90%
and new understandings.

00:21:51.790 --> 00:21:55.690 align:middle line:84%
And I'd like to share with you
precisely the exact language

00:21:55.690 --> 00:21:58.630 align:middle line:84%
of what the scientists at the
Weitzman Research Institute

00:21:58.630 --> 00:22:02.980 align:middle line:84%
discovered when they repeated
the double-slit experiment.

00:22:02.980 --> 00:22:06.880 align:middle line:84%
1998, scientific headlines
all over the world

00:22:06.880 --> 00:22:08.620 align:middle line:90%
reported this experiment.

00:22:08.620 --> 00:22:10.600 align:middle line:10%
And they read, and
this is a quote,

00:22:10.600 --> 00:22:13.840 align:middle line:10%
"researchers at the Weitzman
Institute of Science conducted

00:22:13.840 --> 00:22:18.580 align:middle line:10%
a highly controlled experiment
demonstrating how a beam

00:22:18.580 --> 00:22:21.610 align:middle line:10%
of electrons"-- so these
are quantum particles--

00:22:21.610 --> 00:22:28.330 align:middle line:10%
a beam of electrons "is affected
by the act of being observed."

00:22:28.330 --> 00:22:32.680 align:middle line:84%
But even beyond that--
that observation effect

00:22:32.680 --> 00:22:34.030 align:middle line:90%
was noted early in the century.

00:22:34.030 --> 00:22:35.380 align:middle line:90%
But listen to this.

00:22:35.380 --> 00:22:39.090 align:middle line:84%
Listen to the new portion
of this discovery.

00:22:39.090 --> 00:22:43.030 align:middle line:10%
The scientists said, quote,
"the experiment revealed

00:22:43.030 --> 00:22:46.870 align:middle line:10%
that the greater the
amount of watching,

00:22:46.870 --> 00:22:50.260 align:middle line:10%
the greater the observer's
influence on what actually

00:22:50.260 --> 00:22:52.950 align:middle line:10%
takes place," and of quote.

00:22:52.950 --> 00:22:55.660 align:middle line:84%
And this was actually reported
in a very prestigious journal

00:22:55.660 --> 00:23:00.340 align:middle line:84%
"Nature," February 26, 1998,
volume 391, if you want

00:23:00.340 --> 00:23:02.150 align:middle line:90%
to look it up for yourself.

00:23:02.150 --> 00:23:06.280 align:middle line:84%
This experiment is telling
us that not only are we

00:23:06.280 --> 00:23:10.600 align:middle line:84%
intimately enmeshed
with the world around us

00:23:10.600 --> 00:23:14.710 align:middle line:84%
and with the world within us,
but the more focus, the greater

00:23:14.710 --> 00:23:17.560 align:middle line:84%
our focus, the greater the
attention that we give,

00:23:17.560 --> 00:23:19.360 align:middle line:84%
specifically something
that's happening

00:23:19.360 --> 00:23:21.820 align:middle line:84%
in our lives, the
greater the effect.

00:23:21.820 --> 00:23:25.360 align:middle line:84%
But I think this is interesting,
because we already knew this

00:23:25.360 --> 00:23:27.075 align:middle line:84%
if we followed the
principles in some

00:23:27.075 --> 00:23:31.180 align:middle line:84%
of our most ancient, again, and
cherished spiritual traditions.

00:23:31.180 --> 00:23:36.970 align:middle line:84%
For example, in the Sutra
from the Mahayana Buddhist

00:23:36.970 --> 00:23:39.490 align:middle line:84%
traditions, there
is a statement that

00:23:39.490 --> 00:23:43.090 align:middle line:84%
essentially summarizes what
the Weitzman experience just

00:23:43.090 --> 00:23:44.050 align:middle line:90%
told us.

00:23:44.050 --> 00:23:48.670 align:middle line:84%
And that statement says,
quote, "Reality exists only

00:23:48.670 --> 00:23:51.820 align:middle line:84%
where the mind creates
a focus." "Reality

00:23:51.820 --> 00:23:54.640 align:middle line:84%
exists only where the
mind creates a focus."

00:23:54.640 --> 00:23:56.380 align:middle line:84%
So the ancient Buddhist
traditions, they

00:23:56.380 --> 00:23:57.850 align:middle line:84%
didn't have the
science, but they sure

00:23:57.850 --> 00:23:58.930 align:middle line:90%
understood the principle.

00:23:58.930 --> 00:24:00.640 align:middle line:90%
They understood the mechanism.

00:24:00.640 --> 00:24:05.450 align:middle line:84%
Where we create this
convergence of thought, feeling,

00:24:05.450 --> 00:24:09.130 align:middle line:84%
and emotion, where
we create that focus,

00:24:09.130 --> 00:24:12.340 align:middle line:84%
that is us observing
the world around us.

00:24:12.340 --> 00:24:16.580 align:middle line:84%
And it is that
experience and the fact

00:24:16.580 --> 00:24:20.870 align:middle line:84%
that that experience has such
a powerful effect in our lives

00:24:20.870 --> 00:24:22.760 align:middle line:84%
that actually made
Albert Einstein-- it

00:24:22.760 --> 00:24:24.660 align:middle line:90%
was making him crazy.

00:24:24.660 --> 00:24:28.160 align:middle line:84%
This is the piece of the
puzzle that Einstein was never

00:24:28.160 --> 00:24:29.840 align:middle line:90%
able to solve.

00:24:29.840 --> 00:24:32.060 align:middle line:10%
He began early in
the 20th century

00:24:32.060 --> 00:24:34.820 align:middle line:10%
with his theories of
relativity, and he was always

00:24:34.820 --> 00:24:40.539 align:middle line:10%
searching for a unified
theory, a unified field theory.

00:24:40.539 --> 00:24:41.830 align:middle line:90%
And here's what I mean by that.

00:24:41.830 --> 00:24:45.020 align:middle line:84%
A unified field theory
is where a scientist,

00:24:45.020 --> 00:24:49.730 align:middle line:84%
like Albert Einstein, creates a
single story that incorporates

00:24:49.730 --> 00:24:53.840 align:middle line:84%
all of the facets of nature
and physics and mathematics

00:24:53.840 --> 00:24:56.990 align:middle line:84%
into one coherent story
of us, our universe,

00:24:56.990 --> 00:24:58.680 align:middle line:90%
and our relationship to it.

00:24:58.680 --> 00:25:01.040 align:middle line:84%
The unified field theory
has been an elusive theory.

00:25:01.040 --> 00:25:03.710 align:middle line:90%
It has yet to be discovered.

00:25:03.710 --> 00:25:05.721 align:middle line:84%
And the world
supported Einstein,

00:25:05.721 --> 00:25:07.970 align:middle line:84%
thinking that this is the
man-- if anyone could do it,

00:25:07.970 --> 00:25:09.050 align:middle line:90%
he could do it.

00:25:09.050 --> 00:25:10.880 align:middle line:90%
Here's where Einstein got stuck.

00:25:10.880 --> 00:25:13.010 align:middle line:84%
And he actually admitted
this on his deathbed

00:25:13.010 --> 00:25:14.930 align:middle line:90%
in the early 1950s.

00:25:14.930 --> 00:25:20.360 align:middle line:84%
He got stuck because he did not
like the idea that we are so

00:25:20.360 --> 00:25:22.730 align:middle line:84%
intimately connected
with our universe

00:25:22.730 --> 00:25:25.850 align:middle line:84%
that we could have any
influence whatsoever

00:25:25.850 --> 00:25:30.260 align:middle line:84%
on the universe in one place
with us being in another place.

00:25:30.260 --> 00:25:32.760 align:middle line:84%
And as I mentioned earlier,
he actually had a name.

00:25:32.760 --> 00:25:37.010 align:middle line:84%
He called this "spooky
action at a distance."

00:25:37.010 --> 00:25:40.220 align:middle line:84%
He called this "spooky
action at a distance,"

00:25:40.220 --> 00:25:43.160 align:middle line:90%
because to him, it was spooky.

00:25:43.160 --> 00:25:45.920 align:middle line:84%
One of the things I find
particularly fascinating

00:25:45.920 --> 00:25:50.210 align:middle line:84%
is that although
Einstein was working

00:25:50.210 --> 00:25:52.970 align:middle line:84%
with the same mathematics
and the same equations

00:25:52.970 --> 00:25:57.110 align:middle line:84%
as his friends and colleagues,
he came to the conclusion

00:25:57.110 --> 00:25:59.870 align:middle line:84%
that we are separate
from one another

00:25:59.870 --> 00:26:02.600 align:middle line:84%
and that we are separate
from the universe

00:26:02.600 --> 00:26:05.430 align:middle line:84%
and that we can be
observers in the universe.

00:26:05.430 --> 00:26:08.360 align:middle line:84%
However, a dear
friend and colleague

00:26:08.360 --> 00:26:12.100 align:middle line:84%
of Albert Einstein's a man that
lived much longer than Einstein

00:26:12.100 --> 00:26:15.800 align:middle line:84%
and had a tremendously
powerful influence in quantum

00:26:15.800 --> 00:26:18.730 align:middle line:84%
physics at Princeton
University and our world today

00:26:18.730 --> 00:26:20.000 align:middle line:90%
was Professor John Wheeler.

00:26:20.000 --> 00:26:22.977 align:middle line:84%
He passed away just
a few years ago.

00:26:22.977 --> 00:26:25.310 align:middle line:10%
So John Wheeler and Albert
Einstein-- they were friends,

00:26:25.310 --> 00:26:27.435 align:middle line:10%
they were colleagues looking
at the same equations,

00:26:27.435 --> 00:26:31.860 align:middle line:10%
the same math, drawing
vastly different conclusions.

00:26:31.860 --> 00:26:34.160 align:middle line:10%
So while Einstein
believed that we're

00:26:34.160 --> 00:26:37.950 align:middle line:10%
separate and have no effect,
Wheeler said just the opposite.

00:26:37.950 --> 00:26:41.030 align:middle line:84%
And I want to share with you
John Wheeler's exact words

00:26:41.030 --> 00:26:44.990 align:middle line:84%
just so you can hear his
process and his thinking

00:26:44.990 --> 00:26:48.020 align:middle line:84%
and how passionate
he was about this.

00:26:48.020 --> 00:26:53.570 align:middle line:84%
John Wheeler said we had
this old idea that there is

00:26:53.570 --> 00:26:56.340 align:middle line:90%
a universe out there somewhere.

00:26:56.340 --> 00:27:00.530 align:middle line:84%
And here's man, what he
called the observer, safely

00:27:00.530 --> 00:27:04.400 align:middle line:84%
protected from the
universe by what he called

00:27:04.400 --> 00:27:07.720 align:middle line:90%
a six-inch slab of plate glass.

00:27:07.720 --> 00:27:09.770 align:middle line:84%
OK, so it's not
really plate glass,

00:27:09.770 --> 00:27:12.030 align:middle line:84%
but that is his way
of saying that there

00:27:12.030 --> 00:27:15.500 align:middle line:84%
is something between us
and the universe out there.

00:27:15.500 --> 00:27:16.790 align:middle line:90%
But he continues.

00:27:16.790 --> 00:27:21.350 align:middle line:84%
He said, now we learn that
to even observe an electron,

00:27:21.350 --> 00:27:23.570 align:middle line:84%
we have to shatter
that plate glass.

00:27:23.570 --> 00:27:24.990 align:middle line:90%
And listen to what he said.

00:27:24.990 --> 00:27:28.250 align:middle line:84%
He said, so the old
word "observer" simply

00:27:28.250 --> 00:27:30.410 align:middle line:90%
has to be crossed off the books.

00:27:30.410 --> 00:27:32.240 align:middle line:90%
He said, there are no observers.

00:27:32.240 --> 00:27:36.980 align:middle line:84%
We must put in the new word
"participator"-- no observers,

00:27:36.980 --> 00:27:38.320 align:middle line:90%
only participators.

00:27:38.320 --> 00:27:39.350 align:middle line:90%
So what does this mean?

00:27:39.350 --> 00:27:42.620 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to just
very, very quickly

00:27:42.620 --> 00:27:46.810 align:middle line:84%
encapsulate this idea of why
it's so powerful in our lives.

00:27:46.810 --> 00:27:48.560 align:middle line:84%
Because what John
Wheeler has just said to

00:27:48.560 --> 00:27:53.030 align:middle line:84%
us tells us that we will never
find the smallest particle

00:27:53.030 --> 00:27:57.290 align:middle line:84%
of matter, no matter how many
atoms and quantum particles

00:27:57.290 --> 00:27:59.180 align:middle line:84%
that we smash into
one another and break

00:27:59.180 --> 00:28:02.240 align:middle line:84%
into a bajillion pieces looking
for smaller smaller pieces.

00:28:02.240 --> 00:28:05.210 align:middle line:84%
And we will never find
the edge of the universe,

00:28:05.210 --> 00:28:08.660 align:middle line:84%
no matter how far we look
to the edge of the cosmos

00:28:08.660 --> 00:28:11.980 align:middle line:84%
and how technologically
sophisticated our equipment is.

00:28:11.980 --> 00:28:13.310 align:middle line:90%
And here's the reason why.

00:28:13.310 --> 00:28:15.530 align:middle line:84%
What John Wheeler
just said to us

00:28:15.530 --> 00:28:22.700 align:middle line:84%
is that every place that we look
into the universe, every place

00:28:22.700 --> 00:28:26.810 align:middle line:84%
that we look into nature with
the expectation that something

00:28:26.810 --> 00:28:30.350 align:middle line:84%
is there for us to
see, the expectation

00:28:30.350 --> 00:28:34.580 align:middle line:84%
is the principle that will put
something there for us to see.

00:28:34.580 --> 00:28:38.390 align:middle line:84%
So no matter how far, no matter
how deep, as long as we're

00:28:38.390 --> 00:28:42.140 align:middle line:84%
looking, the act of looking
is the act of creation

00:28:42.140 --> 00:28:44.420 align:middle line:84%
that makes sure there
will always be something

00:28:44.420 --> 00:28:47.120 align:middle line:90%
there for us to see.

00:28:47.120 --> 00:28:51.050 align:middle line:84%
So what we've just witnessed are
the science-based experiments

00:28:51.050 --> 00:28:54.200 align:middle line:84%
and the real-life application
of these experiments

00:28:54.200 --> 00:28:58.250 align:middle line:84%
that not only confirm we are
deeply connected to the world,

00:28:58.250 --> 00:29:02.840 align:middle line:84%
but also confirm that that
connection is so fundamental it

00:29:02.840 --> 00:29:06.440 align:middle line:84%
begins at the very core of
our existence with our DNA,

00:29:06.440 --> 00:29:10.820 align:middle line:84%
where we interact with
life and reality itself.

00:29:10.820 --> 00:29:13.370 align:middle line:84%
In our next episode, let's
take this one step further.

00:29:13.370 --> 00:29:15.830 align:middle line:84%
We'll discover that the
source of our connection

00:29:15.830 --> 00:29:20.880 align:middle line:84%
is directly linked to the
origin of the DNA in our bodies.

00:29:20.880 --> 00:29:24.330 align:middle line:84%
And that's what sets us
apart from all other life.

00:29:24.330 --> 00:29:26.330 align:middle line:84%
