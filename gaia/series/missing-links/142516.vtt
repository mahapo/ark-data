[THEME MUSIC]

00:00:08.432 --> 00:00:24.800 align:middle line:90%


00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:26.930 align:middle line:10%
>> If you're watching
this episode,

00:00:26.930 --> 00:00:30.560 align:middle line:10%
I'm assuming that you have
seen at least some of "Missing

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:31.970 align:middle line:10%
Links."

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:34.700 align:middle line:84%
And one of the things that
probably became very clear

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:37.746 align:middle line:84%
in those episodes
is that we live

00:00:37.746 --> 00:00:38.870 align:middle line:90%
in a world that's changing.

00:00:38.870 --> 00:00:42.110 align:middle line:84%
And it's changing in ways,
that we've never seen before.

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:44.180 align:middle line:84%
We're in uncharted
territory in many respects.

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:46.250 align:middle line:84%
We don't have a good
guidebook to tell us

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:48.620 align:middle line:84%
how to navigate through
the waters of change

00:00:48.620 --> 00:00:50.750 align:middle line:90%
that we find ourselves in today.

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:54.650 align:middle line:84%
So the program itself
laid out the science,

00:00:54.650 --> 00:00:56.480 align:middle line:84%
and some of the
applications in terms

00:00:56.480 --> 00:00:58.650 align:middle line:84%
of what that science
means in our lives.

00:00:58.650 --> 00:01:01.040 align:middle line:10%
But what I want to talk
to you about right now

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:06.530 align:middle line:10%
is the specific
examples of lifestyle,

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:10.190 align:middle line:10%
and how we can change
and adapt our lifestyle

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:11.855 align:middle line:10%
to this time of extremes.

00:01:11.855 --> 00:01:14.180 align:middle line:84%
And I want to be very
clear about the purpose.

00:01:14.180 --> 00:01:17.530 align:middle line:84%
Some people were talking about
how do we survive the changes.

00:01:17.530 --> 00:01:19.220 align:middle line:84%
I don't know about
you, but for me I

00:01:19.220 --> 00:01:21.560 align:middle line:84%
want to do more than
survive, I want to thrive.

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:24.050 align:middle line:84%
And that's precisely
what these changes do.

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:28.400 align:middle line:84%
They allow us to thrive in an
environment that's shifting,

00:01:28.400 --> 00:01:31.620 align:middle line:84%
because we've embraced the fact
of that shifting environment.

00:01:31.620 --> 00:01:35.240 align:middle line:84%
The topics some people
talk about diet,

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:37.520 align:middle line:84%
I prefer to think of
it more as nutrition.

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:40.490 align:middle line:84%
Diet brings to mind
some kind of a regimen

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:43.100 align:middle line:84%
that we do for a period
of time to achieve a goal.

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:45.350 align:middle line:84%
And when that goal is achieved,
maybe we stay with it,

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:46.580 align:middle line:90%
maybe we don't.

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:48.290 align:middle line:84%
It works for some
people, but for me I

00:01:48.290 --> 00:01:50.420 align:middle line:84%
prefer to think of it
as a way of living,

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:52.730 align:middle line:84%
and the nutrition that
I give my body everyday.

00:01:52.730 --> 00:01:55.670 align:middle line:10%
So, I want to talk to you
about nutrition, exercise,

00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:59.960 align:middle line:10%
supplements, and about
the heart-brain connection

00:01:59.960 --> 00:02:03.520 align:middle line:10%
that we've talked about
in "Missing Links."

00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:07.150 align:middle line:84%
When it comes to nutrition,
what the scientists are now

00:02:07.150 --> 00:02:10.330 align:middle line:84%
telling us, and they
think is new information,

00:02:10.330 --> 00:02:12.640 align:middle line:84%
parallels very
closely the wisdom

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:15.460 align:middle line:84%
of our most ancient and
cherished spiritual traditions.

00:02:15.460 --> 00:02:17.680 align:middle line:84%
And that is simply
this, the closer

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:23.110 align:middle line:84%
that we can gather our
nutrition from living foods,

00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:27.220 align:middle line:84%
plant-based diet, specifically
the more nutrition,

00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:28.960 align:middle line:84%
and the better
quality of nutrition

00:02:28.960 --> 00:02:30.880 align:middle line:90%
it creates for our bodies.

00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:32.500 align:middle line:84%
Now, for a lot of
doctors I know,

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:34.510 align:middle line:84%
they're saying it's
like it's something new.

00:02:34.510 --> 00:02:36.610 align:middle line:84%
But I want to share
something with you.

00:02:36.610 --> 00:02:40.690 align:middle line:10%
I mentioned in previous episodes
that the Nag Hammadi library,

00:02:40.690 --> 00:02:42.940 align:middle line:10%
for example, the Gnostic Texts.

00:02:42.940 --> 00:02:45.017 align:middle line:84%
That library was edited
in the fourth century

00:02:45.017 --> 00:02:47.350 align:middle line:84%
by the Catholic Church, and
there were at least 43 books

00:02:47.350 --> 00:02:49.900 align:middle line:84%
we know that were either
removed altogether, or condensed

00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:51.280 align:middle line:90%
and replaced.

00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:53.830 align:middle line:84%
Among those books,
the Gospel of Thomas.

00:02:53.830 --> 00:02:55.660 align:middle line:84%
Thomas being the
scribe that recorded

00:02:55.660 --> 00:02:58.960 align:middle line:84%
the words of the
master teacher, Jesus,

00:02:58.960 --> 00:03:00.790 align:middle line:90%
as he spoke to his community.

00:03:00.790 --> 00:03:03.550 align:middle line:84%
So, this isn't about
a religious man,

00:03:03.550 --> 00:03:05.716 align:middle line:84%
this is about a master
teacher answering

00:03:05.716 --> 00:03:07.840 align:middle line:84%
for his community many of
the same questions you're

00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:09.040 align:middle line:90%
asking me.

00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:10.750 align:middle line:84%
They were saying,
Master, what is it

00:03:10.750 --> 00:03:13.060 align:middle line:84%
that we should eat
to bring strength

00:03:13.060 --> 00:03:14.310 align:middle line:90%
and health to our bodies?

00:03:14.310 --> 00:03:16.480 align:middle line:84%
How do we bring healing
to our own bodies?

00:03:16.480 --> 00:03:19.190 align:middle line:84%
What he said to his
community was this.

00:03:19.190 --> 00:03:22.490 align:middle line:84%
He said, the things that
give life to your food

00:03:22.490 --> 00:03:24.750 align:middle line:84%
will give life to
your body, also.

00:03:24.750 --> 00:03:28.690 align:middle line:84%
And the things that destroy your
food will destroy your body.

00:03:28.690 --> 00:03:31.430 align:middle line:84%
I don't know about you, that
cannot be any clearer to me.

00:03:31.430 --> 00:03:35.530 align:middle line:84%
In the eloquent masterful words
spoken over 2,000 years ago,

00:03:35.530 --> 00:03:38.230 align:middle line:84%
he's telling us what the
best science of our time

00:03:38.230 --> 00:03:39.960 align:middle line:90%
has found for today.

00:03:39.960 --> 00:03:46.390 align:middle line:84%
That when we overcook our
foods, when we hydrogenate them

00:03:46.390 --> 00:03:49.000 align:middle line:84%
with oils, when
they're processed

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:53.680 align:middle line:84%
through artificial ways
of creating substances

00:03:53.680 --> 00:03:54.820 align:middle line:90%
that really aren't food.

00:03:54.820 --> 00:03:56.530 align:middle line:84%
If the food that
we're eating doesn't

00:03:56.530 --> 00:03:59.650 align:middle line:84%
come from a garden in the earth
where you can identify it,

00:03:59.650 --> 00:04:01.510 align:middle line:90%
it's probably not food.

00:04:01.510 --> 00:04:02.940 align:middle line:90%
And I think this is so true.

00:04:02.940 --> 00:04:05.590 align:middle line:84%
So, the closer we
can get our food

00:04:05.590 --> 00:04:08.920 align:middle line:84%
to its natural source, the
better quality of nutrition

00:04:08.920 --> 00:04:10.150 align:middle line:90%
that we're going to find.

00:04:10.150 --> 00:04:13.900 align:middle line:84%
Almost universally, scientists
have agreed that a plant-based

00:04:13.900 --> 00:04:15.834 align:middle line:90%
diet is optimum--

00:04:15.834 --> 00:04:17.500 align:middle line:84%
doesn't mean that we
shouldn't eat meat.

00:04:17.500 --> 00:04:18.958 align:middle line:10%
If you're going to
eat meat, it has

00:04:18.958 --> 00:04:23.386 align:middle line:10%
to be really cleanly grown,
fed, with the kinds of nutrients

00:04:23.386 --> 00:04:24.760 align:middle line:10%
we all know the
terms free-range,

00:04:24.760 --> 00:04:27.610 align:middle line:10%
grass-fed all those
kinds of things.

00:04:27.610 --> 00:04:30.430 align:middle line:84%
But here's the thing, and
I know this for myself.

00:04:30.430 --> 00:04:33.950 align:middle line:84%
When I travel, it's hard to
eat well every single day.

00:04:33.950 --> 00:04:36.610 align:middle line:84%
And I know people that beat
themselves up when they

00:04:36.610 --> 00:04:38.540 align:middle line:90%
can't honor that commitment.

00:04:38.540 --> 00:04:40.480 align:middle line:84%
So, I'm going to share
with you the promise I

00:04:40.480 --> 00:04:43.120 align:middle line:90%
made to myself a long time ago.

00:04:43.120 --> 00:04:44.900 align:middle line:90%
I'm living in the real world.

00:04:44.900 --> 00:04:46.870 align:middle line:84%
I'm walking in this
world, doing the best

00:04:46.870 --> 00:04:51.280 align:middle line:84%
I can to be the best person
I can to share with you what

00:04:51.280 --> 00:04:53.080 align:middle line:90%
I know to be true.

00:04:53.080 --> 00:04:55.300 align:middle line:84%
And the promise
I made to my body

00:04:55.300 --> 00:04:59.200 align:middle line:84%
is every meal that I
ingest in that moment,

00:04:59.200 --> 00:05:01.780 align:middle line:84%
I will give my body the
absolute best that's

00:05:01.780 --> 00:05:03.760 align:middle line:90%
available in that moment.

00:05:03.760 --> 00:05:06.760 align:middle line:84%
And if it's not what I
typically eat, that's OK.

00:05:06.760 --> 00:05:09.650 align:middle line:84%
Because that's the best
I have in that moment.

00:05:09.650 --> 00:05:11.830 align:middle line:84%
The next moment,
the next opportunity

00:05:11.830 --> 00:05:13.960 align:middle line:84%
I have for a meal,
if I'm given a choice

00:05:13.960 --> 00:05:16.990 align:middle line:84%
between a beautiful
meal of something

00:05:16.990 --> 00:05:21.340 align:middle line:84%
that I would typically
choose and some tasty snack

00:05:21.340 --> 00:05:23.680 align:middle line:84%
that the airplane
is offering me,

00:05:23.680 --> 00:05:26.020 align:middle line:84%
this is where the workshop
of my life begins.

00:05:26.020 --> 00:05:28.030 align:middle line:84%
Because the promise
I made to my body

00:05:28.030 --> 00:05:31.379 align:middle line:84%
was to choose the best that's
available in that moment.

00:05:31.379 --> 00:05:33.170 align:middle line:84%
And I'm going to do
that every single time.

00:05:33.170 --> 00:05:35.849 align:middle line:84%
So, this is the promise
I made to myself.

00:05:35.849 --> 00:05:37.390 align:middle line:84%
I don't typically
eat a lot of pasta,

00:05:37.390 --> 00:05:39.070 align:middle line:90%
for example, when I'm home.

00:05:39.070 --> 00:05:41.350 align:middle line:84%
On the road, it's
possible you can

00:05:41.350 --> 00:05:43.734 align:middle line:84%
be a non-carnivore
and starve in some

00:05:43.734 --> 00:05:45.650 align:middle line:84%
of the most beautiful
hotels in the world that

00:05:45.650 --> 00:05:48.340 align:middle line:84%
have beautiful
food, but it's not

00:05:48.340 --> 00:05:52.160 align:middle line:84%
the kind of food that is
grown in our father's garden,

00:05:52.160 --> 00:05:53.350 align:middle line:90%
for example.

00:05:53.350 --> 00:05:56.110 align:middle line:84%
So, I'm going to invite you just
to think about those things.

00:05:56.110 --> 00:05:58.485 align:middle line:84%
If you can give yourself the
highest quality of nutrition

00:05:58.485 --> 00:06:01.270 align:middle line:84%
at every meal, that's
key number one.

00:06:01.270 --> 00:06:03.040 align:middle line:90%
Number two, movement.

00:06:03.040 --> 00:06:05.680 align:middle line:90%
Our bodies are designed to move.

00:06:05.680 --> 00:06:08.170 align:middle line:84%
We typically think of
exercise in the way

00:06:08.170 --> 00:06:12.650 align:middle line:84%
that we do, as a diet, that it's
something you do in a moment,

00:06:12.650 --> 00:06:14.230 align:middle line:90%
and then you're done with it.

00:06:14.230 --> 00:06:15.790 align:middle line:84%
If you can think
of exercise more

00:06:15.790 --> 00:06:17.800 align:middle line:84%
as a way of being
throughout the day.

00:06:17.800 --> 00:06:21.880 align:middle line:84%
And every opportunity that you
have, move parts of your body

00:06:21.880 --> 00:06:25.540 align:middle line:84%
if you were living in the
jungle 10,000 years ago,

00:06:25.540 --> 00:06:29.654 align:middle line:84%
parts of your body that you
would need to move and to use.

00:06:29.654 --> 00:06:30.820 align:middle line:90%
So, it can be simple things.

00:06:30.820 --> 00:06:32.445 align:middle line:84%
When you're walking
through an airport,

00:06:32.445 --> 00:06:34.990 align:middle line:84%
you have a choice between
taking a moving stairway

00:06:34.990 --> 00:06:38.590 align:middle line:84%
and moving under your own
volition, take the walk.

00:06:38.590 --> 00:06:40.675 align:middle line:84%
You've been on a plane or
you've been in the car,

00:06:40.675 --> 00:06:42.400 align:middle line:90%
it's good for you to do that.

00:06:42.400 --> 00:06:45.310 align:middle line:84%
But the whole definition
of exercise is changing.

00:06:45.310 --> 00:06:48.050 align:middle line:90%


00:06:48.050 --> 00:06:50.320 align:middle line:84%
Exercise physiologists
now are telling us

00:06:50.320 --> 00:06:53.770 align:middle line:84%
that what we used to think of
as exercise 15 and 20 years ago,

00:06:53.770 --> 00:06:57.010 align:middle line:84%
high intensity aerobics,
distance running, and things

00:06:57.010 --> 00:07:00.320 align:middle line:90%
like that here's the key.

00:07:00.320 --> 00:07:03.230 align:middle line:84%
They can be good
for us, however,

00:07:03.230 --> 00:07:08.550 align:middle line:84%
what they mean to our
bodies changes as we age.

00:07:08.550 --> 00:07:11.030 align:middle line:84%
So, at different points of
our life, different ages

00:07:11.030 --> 00:07:13.670 align:middle line:84%
of our life, our body
interprets different kinds

00:07:13.670 --> 00:07:15.330 align:middle line:90%
of exercise in different ways.

00:07:15.330 --> 00:07:17.540 align:middle line:84%
For example, high
intensity aerobics,

00:07:17.540 --> 00:07:21.990 align:middle line:84%
distance running for man or
a woman under 40 years old.

00:07:21.990 --> 00:07:27.260 align:middle line:84%
These, are examples of
where we can optimize,

00:07:27.260 --> 00:07:29.150 align:middle line:84%
the way our bodies
are functioning.

00:07:29.150 --> 00:07:31.150 align:middle line:84%
After 40, as the
hormones begin to change,

00:07:31.150 --> 00:07:32.900 align:middle line:84%
our bodies interpret
that kind of exercise

00:07:32.900 --> 00:07:34.280 align:middle line:90%
completely differently.

00:07:34.280 --> 00:07:35.740 align:middle line:90%
So, what does that mean?

00:07:35.740 --> 00:07:37.970 align:middle line:84%
It means after
40, we are looking

00:07:37.970 --> 00:07:42.140 align:middle line:84%
for the kind of exercise that is
high intensity, short duration

00:07:42.140 --> 00:07:43.190 align:middle line:90%
intervals.

00:07:43.190 --> 00:07:47.330 align:middle line:84%
So, maybe 30 seconds of a
very high intensity cycling,

00:07:47.330 --> 00:07:50.380 align:middle line:90%
running, push ups, anything.

00:07:50.380 --> 00:07:52.250 align:middle line:84%
30 seconds all out,
as hard as you can.

00:07:52.250 --> 00:07:55.700 align:middle line:84%
Resting for 15 seconds, and
then going into another interval

00:07:55.700 --> 00:07:57.422 align:middle line:90%
of another kind of movement.

00:07:57.422 --> 00:07:58.880 align:middle line:84%
And what the studies
are showing is

00:07:58.880 --> 00:08:03.584 align:middle line:84%
if we can use multiple large
muscle groups simultaneously,

00:08:03.584 --> 00:08:05.750 align:middle line:84%
that's where we have the
greatest benefit to balance

00:08:05.750 --> 00:08:08.030 align:middle line:84%
the hormones for both
men and women over 40,

00:08:08.030 --> 00:08:09.900 align:middle line:90%
as our hormones begin to change.

00:08:09.900 --> 00:08:11.517 align:middle line:10%
We're both talking
about estrogen,

00:08:11.517 --> 00:08:13.100 align:middle line:10%
we're both talking
about testosterone,

00:08:13.100 --> 00:08:16.319 align:middle line:10%
progesterone, DHEA
levels-- the precursor

00:08:16.319 --> 00:08:18.110 align:middle line:10%
to every one of the
hormones in our bodies.

00:08:18.110 --> 00:08:19.820 align:middle line:10%
We need to optimize these.

00:08:19.820 --> 00:08:22.610 align:middle line:10%
And our bodies will interpret
exercise differently

00:08:22.610 --> 00:08:25.670 align:middle line:10%
after the age, right around 40,
it's different for everyone,

00:08:25.670 --> 00:08:28.130 align:middle line:10%
but generally, right
around 40 years of age.

00:08:28.130 --> 00:08:31.190 align:middle line:84%
So, that's why people I
know, 50's and 60's, are

00:08:31.190 --> 00:08:33.559 align:middle line:84%
on the treadmill,
they're doing the cycles.

00:08:33.559 --> 00:08:35.257 align:middle line:84%
They say, man, I
do this every day,

00:08:35.257 --> 00:08:36.590 align:middle line:90%
and I seem to be gaining weight.

00:08:36.590 --> 00:08:38.780 align:middle line:90%
And I seem to be out of shape.

00:08:38.780 --> 00:08:41.659 align:middle line:84%
My muscle tone is
gone, it's flab.

00:08:41.659 --> 00:08:46.400 align:middle line:84%
Our bodies, after the age of 40,
interpret that kind of exercise

00:08:46.400 --> 00:08:51.020 align:middle line:84%
as the need to pack on
the weight to prepare.

00:08:51.020 --> 00:08:52.829 align:middle line:84%
Because the body
says, I don't know

00:08:52.829 --> 00:08:55.370 align:middle line:84%
how long I'm going to need to
do this or when I need to rest.

00:08:55.370 --> 00:08:57.710 align:middle line:84%
So, it's a completely
different signal to the body.

00:08:57.710 --> 00:09:00.620 align:middle line:10%
I'm inviting you now to check
this stuff out for yourself.

00:09:00.620 --> 00:09:02.630 align:middle line:10%
Do your due diligence
on what works for you,

00:09:02.630 --> 00:09:04.520 align:middle line:10%
but the idea of
exercise is changing.

00:09:04.520 --> 00:09:05.930 align:middle line:90%
That's number two.

00:09:05.930 --> 00:09:07.340 align:middle line:90%
Number three, supplements.

00:09:07.340 --> 00:09:10.070 align:middle line:84%
A lot of controversy
about supplements.

00:09:10.070 --> 00:09:13.640 align:middle line:10%
In an ideal world,
10,000 years ago,

00:09:13.640 --> 00:09:15.340 align:middle line:10%
the food that we
get from the garden

00:09:15.340 --> 00:09:19.310 align:middle line:10%
that we grow in our backyard may
have had all of the nutrients

00:09:19.310 --> 00:09:21.260 align:middle line:10%
that we need to
sustain our bodies.

00:09:21.260 --> 00:09:22.940 align:middle line:10%
And the very sad
truth is right now,

00:09:22.940 --> 00:09:25.400 align:middle line:10%
even the best
homegrown gardens where

00:09:25.400 --> 00:09:29.360 align:middle line:10%
we cultivate our own
mixture of soil, the tests

00:09:29.360 --> 00:09:31.820 align:middle line:10%
are showing that the
food that comes from that

00:09:31.820 --> 00:09:35.620 align:middle line:10%
does not have the
density of nutrients

00:09:35.620 --> 00:09:38.750 align:middle line:10%
that our bodies were accustomed
to over 10,000 years ago.

00:09:38.750 --> 00:09:41.810 align:middle line:84%
That means it's a good
idea to supplement.

00:09:41.810 --> 00:09:43.430 align:middle line:84%
There is no one
size that fits all,

00:09:43.430 --> 00:09:45.050 align:middle line:84%
everyone needs
different supplements.

00:09:45.050 --> 00:09:48.020 align:middle line:84%
And this is where
where medical science

00:09:48.020 --> 00:09:50.360 align:middle line:90%
can help us pinpoint this.

00:09:50.360 --> 00:09:53.162 align:middle line:84%
You can't beat medical
science for diagnostics.

00:09:53.162 --> 00:09:54.620 align:middle line:84%
So when you do your
blood test, you

00:09:54.620 --> 00:09:57.770 align:middle line:84%
can find out the annual physical
what is it that's optimized?

00:09:57.770 --> 00:10:00.180 align:middle line:90%
What are you low in?

00:10:00.180 --> 00:10:02.420 align:middle line:84%
And you can
supplement accordingly

00:10:02.420 --> 00:10:05.030 align:middle line:84%
with high quality
therapeutic dosages

00:10:05.030 --> 00:10:07.250 align:middle line:90%
of standardized supplements.

00:10:07.250 --> 00:10:08.880 align:middle line:84%
And you can do an
internet search.

00:10:08.880 --> 00:10:11.450 align:middle line:84%
There are really, really good
supplements that we can buy.

00:10:11.450 --> 00:10:14.390 align:middle line:84%
Not necessarily stuff off
the shelf at the neighborhood

00:10:14.390 --> 00:10:16.880 align:middle line:84%
grocery store, because
the quality of what

00:10:16.880 --> 00:10:19.020 align:middle line:84%
we find the tests
have shown it varies,

00:10:19.020 --> 00:10:20.520 align:middle line:84%
it's not always
what's on the label.

00:10:20.520 --> 00:10:22.520 align:middle line:84%
So, you have to be really
aware of these things.

00:10:22.520 --> 00:10:24.140 align:middle line:10%
But a couple of key ones--

00:10:24.140 --> 00:10:27.170 align:middle line:10%
CoQ10 is an enzyme.

00:10:27.170 --> 00:10:31.250 align:middle line:10%
Every every cell in our body
is using CoQ10, and especially

00:10:31.250 --> 00:10:32.402 align:middle line:10%
our hearts.

00:10:32.402 --> 00:10:33.860 align:middle line:84%
And our hearts are
undergoing a lot

00:10:33.860 --> 00:10:37.070 align:middle line:84%
of stress emotional stress,
because of the uncertainty

00:10:37.070 --> 00:10:38.660 align:middle line:90%
in the world right now.

00:10:38.660 --> 00:10:40.760 align:middle line:90%
Physical stress for many of us.

00:10:40.760 --> 00:10:43.390 align:middle line:84%
Emotional stress translates
into physical stress.

00:10:43.390 --> 00:10:47.470 align:middle line:90%
CoQ10 is an absolute every day.

00:10:47.470 --> 00:10:51.350 align:middle line:90%
The vitamin C, for example.

00:10:51.350 --> 00:10:54.020 align:middle line:84%
What studies are now showing
is that our bodies actually

00:10:54.020 --> 00:10:56.690 align:middle line:84%
need much higher doses of C than
what we've been led to believe.

00:10:56.690 --> 00:11:01.700 align:middle line:84%
The FDA, you know, recommends at
least 1,000 to 2,000 milligrams

00:11:01.700 --> 00:11:02.730 align:middle line:90%
a day.

00:11:02.730 --> 00:11:05.720 align:middle line:84%
Here's the key, vitamin
C in the past has meant

00:11:05.720 --> 00:11:08.120 align:middle line:84%
rose hips, which are
not tolerated well

00:11:08.120 --> 00:11:08.960 align:middle line:90%
by the human body.

00:11:08.960 --> 00:11:10.695 align:middle line:84%
They upset the
stomach, digestion,

00:11:10.695 --> 00:11:12.570 align:middle line:84%
your body doesn't know
what to do with those.

00:11:12.570 --> 00:11:14.270 align:middle line:84%
There's another form
of vitamin C that's

00:11:14.270 --> 00:11:19.190 align:middle line:84%
called ascorbic-based vitamin C.
What that means is it is giving

00:11:19.190 --> 00:11:22.520 align:middle line:84%
your body everything your body
needs to create its own C.

00:11:22.520 --> 00:11:24.560 align:middle line:84%
And this opens the door
to a really interesting

00:11:24.560 --> 00:11:25.700 align:middle line:90%
conversation.

00:11:25.700 --> 00:11:27.710 align:middle line:84%
Humans are one of the
few mammals that do not

00:11:27.710 --> 00:11:30.800 align:middle line:84%
create their own vitamin
C. Most mammals create

00:11:30.800 --> 00:11:34.310 align:middle line:84%
their own vitamin C. If you've
ever been a pregnant woman,

00:11:34.310 --> 00:11:38.632 align:middle line:84%
your body kicked in the enzymes
it needed to create vitamin C.

00:11:38.632 --> 00:11:40.340 align:middle line:84%
And you actually
created your own vitamin

00:11:40.340 --> 00:11:43.220 align:middle line:90%
C while you were pregnant.

00:11:43.220 --> 00:11:45.740 align:middle line:84%
At the end of your pregnancy
when you gave birth,

00:11:45.740 --> 00:11:48.080 align:middle line:84%
that system begins
to shut down again.

00:11:48.080 --> 00:11:51.070 align:middle line:84%
And what it tells us is
that we have the capability.

00:11:51.070 --> 00:11:54.920 align:middle line:84%
That there are genetic
programs within us now

00:11:54.920 --> 00:11:57.800 align:middle line:84%
that seem to to not be
activated in the way

00:11:57.800 --> 00:11:59.310 align:middle line:84%
that they may have
been in the past.

00:11:59.310 --> 00:12:01.310 align:middle line:84%
That's why it's important
to supplement with C.

00:12:01.310 --> 00:12:02.820 align:middle line:10%
A good B complex.

00:12:02.820 --> 00:12:07.110 align:middle line:84%
Vitamin K is one that
is often left out

00:12:07.110 --> 00:12:08.947 align:middle line:90%
in the multi supplements.

00:12:08.947 --> 00:12:10.530 align:middle line:84%
And vitamin K, people
think that's all

00:12:10.530 --> 00:12:11.850 align:middle line:90%
about blood clotting.

00:12:11.850 --> 00:12:14.850 align:middle line:84%
Well, there are different kinds
of K there's K1, there's K2.

00:12:14.850 --> 00:12:20.550 align:middle line:84%
Here's the thing vitamin K
is necessary in our bodies

00:12:20.550 --> 00:12:24.300 align:middle line:84%
to transport the magnesium
and calcium into our bones

00:12:24.300 --> 00:12:26.250 align:middle line:90%
that people take as supplements.

00:12:26.250 --> 00:12:28.020 align:middle line:84%
Women, especially
after menopause,

00:12:28.020 --> 00:12:31.347 align:middle line:84%
begin taking a lot of
magnesium and calcium,

00:12:31.347 --> 00:12:33.180 align:middle line:84%
thinking they are
strengthening their bones.

00:12:33.180 --> 00:12:35.402 align:middle line:84%
If the vitamin K is not
present, it will never

00:12:35.402 --> 00:12:36.360 align:middle line:90%
find it into the bones.

00:12:36.360 --> 00:12:38.820 align:middle line:84%
It builds up as plaque
in the arteries.

00:12:38.820 --> 00:12:42.547 align:middle line:84%
People that are taking these
tremendous amounts of calcium,

00:12:42.547 --> 00:12:44.880 align:middle line:84%
magnesium, and they're finding
hardening in the arteries

00:12:44.880 --> 00:12:46.470 align:middle line:90%
and high instance of stroke.

00:12:46.470 --> 00:12:48.370 align:middle line:84%
And they just attribute
it to old age.

00:12:48.370 --> 00:12:50.850 align:middle line:84%
It's not old age, it's because
they're taking supplements

00:12:50.850 --> 00:12:51.970 align:middle line:90%
that can't be utilized.

00:12:51.970 --> 00:12:53.920 align:middle line:84%
So, they're building
up as plaque.

00:12:53.920 --> 00:12:59.880 align:middle line:84%
Another one, vitamin C. If
your body is low on vitamin C,

00:12:59.880 --> 00:13:06.420 align:middle line:84%
your body will adjust to
that by creating cholesterol

00:13:06.420 --> 00:13:08.850 align:middle line:84%
to strengthen the
inside of the arteries,

00:13:08.850 --> 00:13:11.220 align:middle line:84%
in response to the
lack of vitamin C.

00:13:11.220 --> 00:13:13.447 align:middle line:84%
So, the flip side of that
is an increase in vitamin C

00:13:13.447 --> 00:13:15.030 align:middle line:84%
creates lower
cholesterol and actually

00:13:15.030 --> 00:13:16.645 align:middle line:90%
is healthier for the arteries.

00:13:16.645 --> 00:13:18.270 align:middle line:84%
These are connections
that aren't often

00:13:18.270 --> 00:13:21.800 align:middle line:90%
made in our society today.

00:13:21.800 --> 00:13:26.210 align:middle line:84%
The fourth aspect,
heart-brain coherence.

00:13:26.210 --> 00:13:30.050 align:middle line:84%
I've talked about this in
depth in one of the episodes

00:13:30.050 --> 00:13:31.850 align:middle line:90%
in "Missing Links."

00:13:31.850 --> 00:13:35.120 align:middle line:84%
The ability to harmonize our
heart and our brain, two organs

00:13:35.120 --> 00:13:38.220 align:middle line:84%
into a single, potent
neural network.

00:13:38.220 --> 00:13:43.130 align:middle line:84%
In addition to the spiritual
implications of intuition,

00:13:43.130 --> 00:13:48.560 align:middle line:84%
deep intuition on demand, direct
access to the subconscious,

00:13:48.560 --> 00:13:50.750 align:middle line:84%
super learning like
Jason Bourne, where

00:13:50.750 --> 00:13:52.760 align:middle line:84%
you have total
recall of everything,

00:13:52.760 --> 00:13:54.410 align:middle line:84%
because we're in
the gamma state.

00:13:54.410 --> 00:13:56.460 align:middle line:84%
Those all come from harmonizing
the heart and the brain.

00:13:56.460 --> 00:13:58.335 align:middle line:84%
But in addition to all
of that, if you're not

00:13:58.335 --> 00:14:00.830 align:middle line:84%
into any of those things,
harmonizing the heart

00:14:00.830 --> 00:14:02.960 align:middle line:90%
and the brain is good for us.

00:14:02.960 --> 00:14:05.240 align:middle line:84%
What it does is it
kicks into high gear

00:14:05.240 --> 00:14:08.450 align:middle line:84%
our immune system, our
anti-aging hormones.

00:14:08.450 --> 00:14:12.260 align:middle line:84%
And it kicks into high
gear our body's ability

00:14:12.260 --> 00:14:15.410 align:middle line:84%
to create the DHEA
that's the precursor

00:14:15.410 --> 00:14:17.180 align:middle line:90%
for every other hormone.

00:14:17.180 --> 00:14:19.550 align:middle line:84%
And what the laboratory
studies have shown

00:14:19.550 --> 00:14:23.870 align:middle line:84%
is that three minutes of
heart-brain coherence,

00:14:23.870 --> 00:14:25.580 align:middle line:84%
where we optimize
this conversation

00:14:25.580 --> 00:14:29.750 align:middle line:84%
between the heart and the
brain, increases our DHEA levels

00:14:29.750 --> 00:14:32.210 align:middle line:90%
over 100%.

00:14:32.210 --> 00:14:33.950 align:middle line:84%
100%, and these
are the precursors

00:14:33.950 --> 00:14:35.750 align:middle line:84%
for all the other
hormones that we need.

00:14:35.750 --> 00:14:37.970 align:middle line:84%
And that increase will
last up to six hours

00:14:37.970 --> 00:14:40.490 align:middle line:84%
without doing anything
else special, simply

00:14:40.490 --> 00:14:44.880 align:middle line:84%
from allowing this heart-brain
coherence to come into place.

00:14:44.880 --> 00:14:48.770 align:middle line:84%
So at a very high level,
these are four categories

00:14:48.770 --> 00:14:52.490 align:middle line:84%
of conscious lifestyle,
conscious change that I

00:14:52.490 --> 00:14:55.520 align:middle line:84%
have found personally, that
I've shared with friends when

00:14:55.520 --> 00:14:57.560 align:middle line:90%
they ask in their audiences.

00:14:57.560 --> 00:15:00.890 align:middle line:84%
What do we do to
fortify ourselves

00:15:00.890 --> 00:15:02.020 align:middle line:90%
in a time of extremes?

00:15:02.020 --> 00:15:03.680 align:middle line:84%
In the presence of
the greatest change

00:15:03.680 --> 00:15:07.490 align:middle line:84%
of 5,000 years of recorded human
history technological change,

00:15:07.490 --> 00:15:10.370 align:middle line:90%
social change, economic change--

00:15:10.370 --> 00:15:12.320 align:middle line:84%
all coming down in
a single generation.

00:15:12.320 --> 00:15:17.480 align:middle line:84%
How do we strengthen ourselves
to embrace and thrive

00:15:17.480 --> 00:15:18.880 align:middle line:90%
in that kind of change?

00:15:18.880 --> 00:15:20.380 align:middle line:84%
The four things
I've shared with you

00:15:20.380 --> 00:15:23.810 align:middle line:84%
are very high level categories
that give us insights

00:15:23.810 --> 00:15:26.240 align:middle line:84%
into precisely things
that allow us to thrive

00:15:26.240 --> 00:15:27.920 align:middle line:90%
in our time of extremes.

00:15:27.920 --> 00:15:32.630 align:middle line:84%
There is a medical model
that has been in place.

00:15:32.630 --> 00:15:35.660 align:middle line:84%
It's a story that's part of
the scientific story that

00:15:35.660 --> 00:15:37.490 align:middle line:90%
is in place.

00:15:37.490 --> 00:15:40.940 align:middle line:84%
It was built, late
1800s, early 1900s.

00:15:40.940 --> 00:15:43.010 align:middle line:84%
And even though the
new research has

00:15:43.010 --> 00:15:44.840 align:middle line:84%
shown that part of
that model is obsolete,

00:15:44.840 --> 00:15:48.650 align:middle line:84%
there is a fight to hang
on to an obsolete story.

00:15:48.650 --> 00:15:51.770 align:middle line:84%
And sadly and honestly,
a big part of that

00:15:51.770 --> 00:15:56.855 align:middle line:84%
is the economic incentive to
hang on to an obsolete story.

00:15:56.855 --> 00:16:01.160 align:middle line:84%
If we continue to live according
to some of these old beliefs,

00:16:01.160 --> 00:16:05.090 align:middle line:84%
it assures a constant
market, and the need

00:16:05.090 --> 00:16:08.660 align:middle line:84%
for new medications,
new drugs to offset

00:16:08.660 --> 00:16:11.630 align:middle line:84%
the side effects of unhealthy
choices in lifestyle.

00:16:11.630 --> 00:16:13.310 align:middle line:84%
And these are all
lifestyle choices.

00:16:13.310 --> 00:16:15.500 align:middle line:84%
This is the beauty of
what we're talking about.

00:16:15.500 --> 00:16:17.510 align:middle line:84%
Everything that
I've just shared,

00:16:17.510 --> 00:16:22.160 align:middle line:84%
all comes under the heading
of choice lifestyle choice.

00:16:22.160 --> 00:16:24.830 align:middle line:84%
And more often than
not, now, new studies

00:16:24.830 --> 00:16:26.630 align:middle line:84%
I've seen a number
of studies were

00:16:26.630 --> 00:16:29.210 align:middle line:84%
published in the journal of
American American Medical

00:16:29.210 --> 00:16:31.894 align:middle line:84%
Association and some of
the scientific journals

00:16:31.894 --> 00:16:34.310 align:middle line:84%
are saying the diseases that
are taking the most lives are

00:16:34.310 --> 00:16:36.190 align:middle line:90%
lifestyle-based diseases.

00:16:36.190 --> 00:16:39.200 align:middle line:84%
And I have personally
been in cultures

00:16:39.200 --> 00:16:42.240 align:middle line:84%
in South America in
the Andes, in Asia,

00:16:42.240 --> 00:16:45.180 align:middle line:90%
where the incidences of cancer--

00:16:45.180 --> 00:16:48.810 align:middle line:84%
breast cancer, prostate
cancer, uterine cancer

00:16:48.810 --> 00:16:51.860 align:middle line:90%
Alzheimer's and dementia--

00:16:51.860 --> 00:16:54.890 align:middle line:84%
they simply do not exist
in these people's lives,

00:16:54.890 --> 00:16:57.770 align:middle line:84%
even though they are
living advanced ages.

00:16:57.770 --> 00:17:02.210 align:middle line:84%
So, to call these diseases
a product of aging,

00:17:02.210 --> 00:17:03.153 align:middle line:90%
makes no sense at all.

00:17:03.153 --> 00:17:04.819 align:middle line:84%
It's not about the
aging, it's about how

00:17:04.819 --> 00:17:08.089 align:middle line:84%
we live as we attain
those advanced ages.

00:17:08.089 --> 00:17:11.540 align:middle line:84%
And the fact that there are
societies and cultures that

00:17:11.540 --> 00:17:14.690 align:middle line:84%
don't reflect any of
those kinds of diseases

00:17:14.690 --> 00:17:17.900 align:middle line:84%
tells us it's about the way
we've been conditioned to think

00:17:17.900 --> 00:17:21.250 align:middle line:90%
and live our lives today.

00:17:21.250 --> 00:17:23.750 align:middle line:84%
A perfect example of this,
I spend a tremendous amount

00:17:23.750 --> 00:17:25.770 align:middle line:84%
of time in the high
Andes of southern Peru,

00:17:25.770 --> 00:17:27.950 align:middle line:90%
and I have since the 1980's.

00:17:27.950 --> 00:17:30.560 align:middle line:90%
The capital is Cusco.

00:17:30.560 --> 00:17:34.730 align:middle line:84%
And Cusco is over
400-year-old community,

00:17:34.730 --> 00:17:36.350 align:middle line:90%
surrounded by native villages.

00:17:36.350 --> 00:17:40.910 align:middle line:84%
Recently, fast food chains
have come into Cusco,

00:17:40.910 --> 00:17:44.120 align:middle line:84%
giving burgers, french
fries, and chicken.

00:17:44.120 --> 00:17:47.960 align:middle line:84%
Making it available
in large batches,

00:17:47.960 --> 00:17:50.600 align:middle line:90%
hydrogenated oils, fried foods.

00:17:50.600 --> 00:17:52.100 align:middle line:84%
And now, for the
first time ever,

00:17:52.100 --> 00:17:54.830 align:middle line:84%
the young people, the
incidences of diabetes,

00:17:54.830 --> 00:17:57.290 align:middle line:84%
are on the increase
with children,

00:17:57.290 --> 00:17:59.690 align:middle line:84%
because they have made
this a constant diet.

00:17:59.690 --> 00:18:02.690 align:middle line:84%
We've seen this within
a span of only 20 years.

00:18:02.690 --> 00:18:05.750 align:middle line:84%
You can see the change,
and their ancestors never

00:18:05.750 --> 00:18:08.150 align:middle line:90%
had these kinds of--

00:18:08.150 --> 00:18:10.010 align:middle line:84%
they ate meat, but
they ate clean meat

00:18:10.010 --> 00:18:12.230 align:middle line:84%
that came from the
environment-- guinea pigs,

00:18:12.230 --> 00:18:15.380 align:middle line:84%
mostly, that come
from the environment.

00:18:15.380 --> 00:18:17.870 align:middle line:84%
So it's all about lifestyle,
the choices that we're making.

00:18:17.870 --> 00:18:19.286 align:middle line:84%
And I think we owe
it to ourselves

00:18:19.286 --> 00:18:23.250 align:middle line:90%
to embrace these deep truths.

00:18:23.250 --> 00:18:25.140 align:middle line:84%
But it all comes down
to the first thing

00:18:25.140 --> 00:18:26.790 align:middle line:90%
we said in this episode.

00:18:26.790 --> 00:18:30.540 align:middle line:84%
And that is simply the things
that give life to our food,

00:18:30.540 --> 00:18:31.680 align:middle line:90%
give life to our bodies.

00:18:31.680 --> 00:18:35.620 align:middle line:84%
And that is so eloquent,
so simple, so powerful.

00:18:35.620 --> 00:18:37.380 align:middle line:84%
And I think about
it every single day,

00:18:37.380 --> 00:18:38.550 align:middle line:90%
every time I create a meal.

00:18:38.550 --> 00:18:42.670 align:middle line:84%
Is this the best I have
to offer in this moment?

00:18:42.670 --> 00:18:45.222 align:middle line:10%
So in the "Missing
Links" series,

00:18:45.222 --> 00:18:46.680 align:middle line:10%
there were a couple
of places where

00:18:46.680 --> 00:18:51.270 align:middle line:10%
I talked a little bit about the
discovery of telomeres-- number

00:18:51.270 --> 00:18:54.660 align:middle line:10%
one, the very
special pieces of DNA

00:18:54.660 --> 00:18:58.530 align:middle line:10%
at the end of each chromosome
that determine, in large part,

00:18:58.530 --> 00:19:01.470 align:middle line:10%
how long the chromosome lives.

00:19:01.470 --> 00:19:03.870 align:middle line:84%
And subsequently, how many
times that cell can divide.

00:19:03.870 --> 00:19:05.950 align:middle line:84%
So, I talked about
that a little bit.

00:19:05.950 --> 00:19:09.120 align:middle line:84%
Um, I want to tie that
in to this conversation

00:19:09.120 --> 00:19:11.100 align:middle line:84%
that we're having about
diet and exercise.

00:19:11.100 --> 00:19:15.030 align:middle line:84%
Because everything I just shared
with you, plant-based diet,

00:19:15.030 --> 00:19:17.400 align:middle line:84%
foods that come from
the earth, rather than

00:19:17.400 --> 00:19:21.319 align:middle line:84%
come from a machine
that's produced them,

00:19:21.319 --> 00:19:22.860 align:middle line:84%
then there's
supplements that we need

00:19:22.860 --> 00:19:25.830 align:middle line:84%
in in very specific
proportions or ratios

00:19:25.830 --> 00:19:29.850 align:middle line:84%
the exercise in our lives that
mimics the movements we would

00:19:29.850 --> 00:19:34.620 align:middle line:84%
go through if we were living,
in a little closer to the earth,

00:19:34.620 --> 00:19:37.350 align:middle line:84%
if we were living, more
active environments

00:19:37.350 --> 00:19:39.660 align:middle line:90%
outdoors, heart-brain coherence.

00:19:39.660 --> 00:19:42.450 align:middle line:84%
Every one of these things
that I've mentioned

00:19:42.450 --> 00:19:47.400 align:middle line:84%
is now being shown to have
a direct effect on our DNA,

00:19:47.400 --> 00:19:48.540 align:middle line:90%
in general.

00:19:48.540 --> 00:19:50.550 align:middle line:84%
And specifically,
on the telomeres

00:19:50.550 --> 00:19:52.454 align:middle line:90%
at the end of the chromosomes.

00:19:52.454 --> 00:19:54.120 align:middle line:84%
So, let me talk to
you just a little bit

00:19:54.120 --> 00:19:56.250 align:middle line:90%
about what that effect is.

00:19:56.250 --> 00:20:00.760 align:middle line:84%
The purpose of the
telomeres is very similar--

00:20:00.760 --> 00:20:02.790 align:middle line:90%
if we think of shoelaces.

00:20:02.790 --> 00:20:04.309 align:middle line:84%
I'm wearing boots
now, so I don't

00:20:04.309 --> 00:20:05.600 align:middle line:90%
have the shoelaces to show you.

00:20:05.600 --> 00:20:08.247 align:middle line:84%
But if you can imagine
at the end of shoelaces,

00:20:08.247 --> 00:20:10.080 align:middle line:84%
typically, there's a
little plastic cap that

00:20:10.080 --> 00:20:12.060 align:middle line:90%
keeps the ends from fraying.

00:20:12.060 --> 00:20:14.130 align:middle line:84%
As long as that cap
is there, those laces

00:20:14.130 --> 00:20:17.460 align:middle line:84%
are easy to lace
up on our shoes.

00:20:17.460 --> 00:20:22.450 align:middle line:84%
Telomeres serve a very similar
function on the end of the DNA.

00:20:22.450 --> 00:20:26.261 align:middle line:84%
Every time the cell divides,
the chromosomes divide.

00:20:26.261 --> 00:20:28.260 align:middle line:84%
And the way the division,
without getting really

00:20:28.260 --> 00:20:31.920 align:middle line:84%
technical, the way
the division happens,

00:20:31.920 --> 00:20:36.300 align:middle line:84%
the ends of the chromosomes will
become brittle and break off,

00:20:36.300 --> 00:20:40.290 align:middle line:84%
and will not go through the
complete division intact

00:20:40.290 --> 00:20:41.820 align:middle line:90%
and that's OK.

00:20:41.820 --> 00:20:45.150 align:middle line:10%
Nature has accounted for that
by putting the chromosome,

00:20:45.150 --> 00:20:47.100 align:middle line:10%
or, the telomeres, on the end.

00:20:47.100 --> 00:20:50.880 align:middle line:10%
So when the incomplete
breakage happens,

00:20:50.880 --> 00:20:53.370 align:middle line:10%
it doesn't happen
in the juicy stuff

00:20:53.370 --> 00:20:55.050 align:middle line:10%
where all the information
is, it happens

00:20:55.050 --> 00:20:57.270 align:middle line:10%
in the telomeres that
are designed to be broken

00:20:57.270 --> 00:20:58.215 align:middle line:10%
and shredded.

00:20:58.215 --> 00:21:00.060 align:middle line:10%
So, that's the good news.

00:21:00.060 --> 00:21:03.150 align:middle line:10%
The flip side of the good news
is every time the cell divides,

00:21:03.150 --> 00:21:06.420 align:middle line:10%
the telomere loses, a
little bit of its length.

00:21:06.420 --> 00:21:08.265 align:middle line:84%
That's OK, because
it divides again,

00:21:08.265 --> 00:21:09.390 align:middle line:90%
it loses a little bit more.

00:21:09.390 --> 00:21:10.530 align:middle line:84%
But that's OK, there's
still some there.

00:21:10.530 --> 00:21:12.064 align:middle line:84%
Divides a little
bit more, but you

00:21:12.064 --> 00:21:13.230 align:middle line:90%
can see where this is going.

00:21:13.230 --> 00:21:17.010 align:middle line:90%
Over time, it will lose so much.

00:21:17.010 --> 00:21:19.560 align:middle line:84%
The telomere will become
so short at the end

00:21:19.560 --> 00:21:24.580 align:middle line:84%
of the chromosome that it
cannot protect that division.

00:21:24.580 --> 00:21:26.880 align:middle line:84%
And when happens,
we call it old age,

00:21:26.880 --> 00:21:29.790 align:middle line:84%
we call it senescence,
we call it death.

00:21:29.790 --> 00:21:34.080 align:middle line:84%
So, this is the determining
factor for how many times

00:21:34.080 --> 00:21:37.440 align:middle line:84%
a cell can divide is how
long those telomeres are.

00:21:37.440 --> 00:21:41.220 align:middle line:10%
In 2009, Carol Greider
and Elizabeth Blackburn,

00:21:41.220 --> 00:21:44.730 align:middle line:10%
two Nobel Prize
winning scientists,

00:21:44.730 --> 00:21:47.640 align:middle line:10%
received the Nobel Prize
in physiology and medicine

00:21:47.640 --> 00:21:49.800 align:middle line:10%
for the discovery of an enzyme.

00:21:49.800 --> 00:21:52.590 align:middle line:84%
And if you haven't seen the
episode that talks about this,

00:21:52.590 --> 00:21:54.500 align:middle line:84%
you're going to love
the name of the enzyme.

00:21:54.500 --> 00:21:59.400 align:middle line:10%
OK, so telomeres are what
give the cells the longevity.

00:21:59.400 --> 00:22:02.550 align:middle line:10%
The name of the enzyme
is called telomerase,

00:22:02.550 --> 00:22:04.540 align:middle line:10%
and that tells the whole story.

00:22:04.540 --> 00:22:07.860 align:middle line:84%
The sole purpose of
the enzyme telomerase

00:22:07.860 --> 00:22:12.180 align:middle line:84%
is to heal, rejuvenate,
and lengthen the telomeres.

00:22:12.180 --> 00:22:15.846 align:middle line:84%
The catch is something has
to activate the telomerase.

00:22:15.846 --> 00:22:17.220 align:middle line:84%
The reason I'm
saying this now is

00:22:17.220 --> 00:22:19.636 align:middle line:84%
because everything I said at
the beginning of this episode

00:22:19.636 --> 00:22:23.340 align:middle line:84%
activates the telomerase--
nutrition, exercise,

00:22:23.340 --> 00:22:26.910 align:middle line:84%
supplements, and specifically,
heart-brain harmony.

00:22:26.910 --> 00:22:28.950 align:middle line:84%
It's called
heart-brain coherence

00:22:28.950 --> 00:22:31.650 align:middle line:84%
when we tune our
heart and our brain

00:22:31.650 --> 00:22:34.616 align:middle line:84%
so that the signal moving
up through the vagus nerve,

00:22:34.616 --> 00:22:35.990 align:middle line:84%
and down through
the spinal cord.

00:22:35.990 --> 00:22:42.600 align:middle line:84%
So, that signal is optimized at
.1 Hertz, a very low frequency.

00:22:42.600 --> 00:22:46.290 align:middle line:84%
When we can tune our heart
and brain to .1 Hertz,

00:22:46.290 --> 00:22:48.790 align:middle line:90%
that is an optimum conversation.

00:22:48.790 --> 00:22:52.410 align:middle line:84%
And one of the effects is
it triggers the telomerase

00:22:52.410 --> 00:22:55.230 align:middle line:84%
in our bodies that
activates that telomerase

00:22:55.230 --> 00:22:57.840 align:middle line:84%
and can actually stop
the aging process,

00:22:57.840 --> 00:23:01.020 align:middle line:84%
reverse the aging process, and
make those telomeres longer,

00:23:01.020 --> 00:23:03.180 align:middle line:90%
no matter how old we are.

00:23:03.180 --> 00:23:06.130 align:middle line:84%
So, this is the beauty of how
the science is tying everything

00:23:06.130 --> 00:23:06.930 align:middle line:90%
together.

00:23:06.930 --> 00:23:09.270 align:middle line:84%
And it helps us to
understand, some

00:23:09.270 --> 00:23:11.040 align:middle line:84%
of the traditions
that I've studied

00:23:11.040 --> 00:23:14.520 align:middle line:84%
were where monks
and nuns have lived,

00:23:14.520 --> 00:23:18.450 align:middle line:84%
exceedingly long lives
120 years and more.

00:23:18.450 --> 00:23:22.260 align:middle line:84%
But they don't look like they've
lived a 120 this is the key.

00:23:22.260 --> 00:23:26.730 align:middle line:84%
There's one way of thinking that
says we come into this world

00:23:26.730 --> 00:23:31.140 align:middle line:84%
as a vessel, for example,
a vessel of life.

00:23:31.140 --> 00:23:35.145 align:middle line:84%
And we have X amount of
life that we begin to use up

00:23:35.145 --> 00:23:36.270 align:middle line:90%
from the moment we're born.

00:23:36.270 --> 00:23:37.920 align:middle line:84%
And you've probably
heard this term

00:23:37.920 --> 00:23:40.374 align:middle line:84%
that we begin to die
the moment we're born.

00:23:40.374 --> 00:23:41.790 align:middle line:84%
That's a way of
thinking, and it's

00:23:41.790 --> 00:23:43.514 align:middle line:90%
embraced by a lot of people.

00:23:43.514 --> 00:23:45.680 align:middle line:84%
But the science is showing
something very different.

00:23:45.680 --> 00:23:48.600 align:middle line:84%
It's more accurate
to say that we begin

00:23:48.600 --> 00:23:51.290 align:middle line:90%
to heal the moment we're born.

00:23:51.290 --> 00:23:54.900 align:middle line:84%
That the vessel of life,
it's not a finite vessel

00:23:54.900 --> 00:23:57.330 align:middle line:84%
that we begin to
use up over time.

00:23:57.330 --> 00:24:00.836 align:middle line:84%
It is a vessel that's being
constantly replenished.

00:24:00.836 --> 00:24:02.460 align:middle line:84%
And we replenish it
through the choices

00:24:02.460 --> 00:24:04.890 align:middle line:90%
of lifestyle we make every day--

00:24:04.890 --> 00:24:08.030 align:middle line:84%
nutrition, movement,
supplements,

00:24:08.030 --> 00:24:11.070 align:middle line:84%
heart-brain connection what we
call our spiritual practices

00:24:11.070 --> 00:24:14.460 align:middle line:84%
all contribute to
filling this vessel.

00:24:14.460 --> 00:24:15.960 align:middle line:90%
So, here's why I'm saying this.

00:24:15.960 --> 00:24:19.400 align:middle line:84%
When I am with an
indigenous person,

00:24:19.400 --> 00:24:22.260 align:middle line:84%
and I talk about these in some
of the books in the exercises

00:24:22.260 --> 00:24:23.850 align:middle line:84%
I was with a Tibetan
nun, for example.

00:24:23.850 --> 00:24:24.650 align:middle line:90%


00:24:24.650 --> 00:24:26.730 align:middle line:84%
I had the entire
conversation with her

00:24:26.730 --> 00:24:29.560 align:middle line:84%
as we hiked up the side of
a mountain to a monastery.

00:24:29.560 --> 00:24:32.520 align:middle line:84%
And it was only after
she went indoors

00:24:32.520 --> 00:24:35.130 align:middle line:84%
that my Tibetan guide
asked me the question.

00:24:35.130 --> 00:24:37.740 align:middle line:84%
He said, Did you enjoy your
conversation with the gaeshi?

00:24:37.740 --> 00:24:39.536 align:middle line:84%
He said, How old do
you think she is?

00:24:39.536 --> 00:24:41.910 align:middle line:84%
I said, I would guess she's
probably in her early, maybe,

00:24:41.910 --> 00:24:42.710 align:middle line:90%
mid 80's.

00:24:42.710 --> 00:24:46.380 align:middle line:84%
He said, the woman you just
talked to is 120 years old.

00:24:46.380 --> 00:24:49.260 align:middle line:84%
The key is our thinking when
someone is 120 years old,

00:24:49.260 --> 00:24:52.500 align:middle line:84%
we think about "Raiders of
the Lost Ark" or the chalice

00:24:52.500 --> 00:24:55.650 align:middle line:84%
where you find a knight hovering
over an ancient secret that

00:24:55.650 --> 00:24:58.270 align:middle line:84%
looks like he's
frail and fragile.

00:24:58.270 --> 00:25:02.200 align:middle line:84%
But if an individual has learned
to embrace these principles,

00:25:02.200 --> 00:25:04.700 align:middle line:84%
then the body keeps
replenishing itself.

00:25:04.700 --> 00:25:09.900 align:middle line:84%
You don't look like you're using
up that last droplet of life

00:25:09.900 --> 00:25:12.280 align:middle line:84%
from a finite vessel, you
look like you're constantly

00:25:12.280 --> 00:25:13.080 align:middle line:90%
replenishing.

00:25:13.080 --> 00:25:14.100 align:middle line:90%
And the nun did.

00:25:14.100 --> 00:25:17.760 align:middle line:84%
Her skin color was good,
her eyes were good,

00:25:17.760 --> 00:25:18.882 align:middle line:90%
her walk was great.

00:25:18.882 --> 00:25:20.340 align:middle line:84%
I mean, she was
walking ahead of me

00:25:20.340 --> 00:25:22.936 align:middle line:84%
up the side of a
16,000 foot cliff.

00:25:22.936 --> 00:25:24.060 align:middle line:90%
And I asked her a question.

00:25:24.060 --> 00:25:26.460 align:middle line:84%
I said, what do you
attribute your longevity to?

00:25:26.460 --> 00:25:28.167 align:middle line:84%
And she pointed
like this to the--

00:25:28.167 --> 00:25:29.250 align:middle line:90%
she goes to the monastery.

00:25:29.250 --> 00:25:31.020 align:middle line:84%
She says, what do
you think we do here?

00:25:31.020 --> 00:25:33.510 align:middle line:84%
She says, I live
what's in these texts.

00:25:33.510 --> 00:25:35.610 align:middle line:84%
I live what's in
these practices.

00:25:35.610 --> 00:25:36.900 align:middle line:90%
The practices are compassion.

00:25:36.900 --> 00:25:41.070 align:middle line:84%
Compassion is a factor
of heart-brain coherence.

00:25:41.070 --> 00:25:42.330 align:middle line:90%
It is the end product.

00:25:42.330 --> 00:25:46.470 align:middle line:84%
First, we have the experience
of sympathy for others

00:25:46.470 --> 00:25:47.580 align:middle line:90%
and other forms of life.

00:25:47.580 --> 00:25:50.640 align:middle line:84%
And from the sympathy
we develop empathy

00:25:50.640 --> 00:25:52.410 align:middle line:84%
for others and
other forms of life.

00:25:52.410 --> 00:25:55.990 align:middle line:84%
Sympathy, we can
recognize the suffering.

00:25:55.990 --> 00:25:59.160 align:middle line:84%
Empathy, we can identify
with the suffering.

00:25:59.160 --> 00:26:01.800 align:middle line:84%
Compassion is the ability
to witness the suffering

00:26:01.800 --> 00:26:03.930 align:middle line:84%
without getting
lost in the hurt.

00:26:03.930 --> 00:26:07.380 align:middle line:84%
And that experience
is directly linked

00:26:07.380 --> 00:26:09.999 align:middle line:84%
to the heart-brain connection
that triggers longevity

00:26:09.999 --> 00:26:11.790 align:middle line:84%
in the cells, that
releases the telomerase.

00:26:11.790 --> 00:26:15.222 align:middle line:84%
So, why do we see so many
people of advanced age

00:26:15.222 --> 00:26:16.680 align:middle line:84%
in these monasteries
and nunneries?

00:26:16.680 --> 00:26:18.810 align:middle line:84%
Because they are
living in their lives

00:26:18.810 --> 00:26:21.570 align:middle line:84%
the principles that
science is now developing.

00:26:21.570 --> 00:26:23.610 align:middle line:84%
And in all fairness,
they don't have

00:26:23.610 --> 00:26:26.700 align:middle line:84%
to deal with the
challenges of life

00:26:26.700 --> 00:26:29.700 align:middle line:84%
because they are
protected, buffered

00:26:29.700 --> 00:26:31.050 align:middle line:90%
in the bubble of that monastery.

00:26:31.050 --> 00:26:32.490 align:middle line:84%
You and I live in
the real world.

00:26:32.490 --> 00:26:35.262 align:middle line:84%
The monastery, for us,
is the world around us.

00:26:35.262 --> 00:26:36.720 align:middle line:84%
And we have to find
the way to live

00:26:36.720 --> 00:26:39.300 align:middle line:84%
our truth in a world
that's constantly changing

00:26:39.300 --> 00:26:40.839 align:middle line:90%
and challenging our truth.

00:26:40.839 --> 00:26:42.630 align:middle line:84%
And one of the ways
that I found to do that

00:26:42.630 --> 00:26:44.640 align:middle line:84%
is by embodying every
one of those principles

00:26:44.640 --> 00:26:48.120 align:middle line:84%
that I've shared to
anchor the deepest

00:26:48.120 --> 00:26:49.610 align:middle line:90%
truth of who I am in the world.

00:26:49.610 --> 00:26:51.990 align:middle line:84%
So when I walk into the
world and I'm challenged,

00:26:51.990 --> 00:26:52.890 align:middle line:90%
that's my rock.

00:26:52.890 --> 00:26:53.930 align:middle line:90%
I call it my rock.

00:26:53.930 --> 00:26:55.920 align:middle line:84%
And as long as I
know what my rock is,

00:26:55.920 --> 00:26:59.490 align:middle line:84%
that's what I know absolutely
to be true in my life.

00:26:59.490 --> 00:27:03.120 align:middle line:10%
As long as I can hang
my emotional body

00:27:03.120 --> 00:27:04.770 align:middle line:10%
and my physicality
on the rock of what

00:27:04.770 --> 00:27:07.860 align:middle line:10%
I know to be true in my
life, I find the strength

00:27:07.860 --> 00:27:11.550 align:middle line:10%
to move into any unknown
situation, any changing world,

00:27:11.550 --> 00:27:13.880 align:middle line:10%
any audience, any challenge.

00:27:13.880 --> 00:27:16.720 align:middle line:84%
And I know I'm going to be
OK, because I know who I am.

00:27:16.720 --> 00:27:20.250 align:middle line:84%
And I'm learning more about
who I am by sharing this

00:27:20.250 --> 00:27:22.767 align:middle line:90%
and by exploring these episodes.

00:27:22.767 --> 00:27:25.690 align:middle line:90%


00:27:25.690 --> 00:27:31.240 align:middle line:10%
When it comes to the
accouterments of spirituality,

00:27:31.240 --> 00:27:33.152 align:middle line:10%
everyone learns differently.

00:27:33.152 --> 00:27:34.610 align:middle line:84%
And that's why it's
good that there

00:27:34.610 --> 00:27:37.750 align:middle line:84%
are so many different
tools to help people learn.

00:27:37.750 --> 00:27:42.850 align:middle line:10%
If a crystal, placed on a
third eye or worn around the,

00:27:42.850 --> 00:27:46.180 align:middle line:10%
throat chakra-- tourmaline
around the throat chakra.

00:27:46.180 --> 00:27:49.710 align:middle line:84%
Or, an elixir coming from
a mushroom fermenting

00:27:49.710 --> 00:27:52.240 align:middle line:84%
in the back of the refrigerator
first thing in the morning.

00:27:52.240 --> 00:27:55.420 align:middle line:84%
If that is useful to you
and your spiritual path,

00:27:55.420 --> 00:27:57.790 align:middle line:84%
then I think it's good
for you to follow that,

00:27:57.790 --> 00:27:59.060 align:middle line:90%
as long as it's useful.

00:27:59.060 --> 00:28:03.760 align:middle line:84%
Here's my caveat,
these are tools

00:28:03.760 --> 00:28:06.790 align:middle line:84%
that can help us achieve
a state of awareness

00:28:06.790 --> 00:28:09.340 align:middle line:90%
and a way of being.

00:28:09.340 --> 00:28:13.390 align:middle line:84%
The ultimate goal is for
us to become those things

00:28:13.390 --> 00:28:14.920 align:middle line:90%
without the tools.

00:28:14.920 --> 00:28:19.510 align:middle line:84%
So if the tools help us
to reach a state of being,

00:28:19.510 --> 00:28:21.940 align:middle line:84%
and then we can let the
tool go, it has served us.

00:28:21.940 --> 00:28:26.332 align:middle line:84%
If the tool is something that we
feel we have to have every day,

00:28:26.332 --> 00:28:28.540 align:middle line:84%
and the moment we feel
stressed, when we say, Oh God,

00:28:28.540 --> 00:28:29.340 align:middle line:90%
where's my crystal?

00:28:29.340 --> 00:28:32.110 align:middle line:84%
Oh God, where's my you
know, people hooked up

00:28:32.110 --> 00:28:33.830 align:middle line:84%
to the computer for
biofeedback-- oh God,

00:28:33.830 --> 00:28:35.950 align:middle line:90%
I've got to have my biofeedback.

00:28:35.950 --> 00:28:39.130 align:middle line:84%
If we get to that point, then
the tool has become a crutch.

00:28:39.130 --> 00:28:43.720 align:middle line:84%
And only you know when your
tool crosses that line.

00:28:43.720 --> 00:28:45.640 align:middle line:84%
Is it still a tool
for you that helps

00:28:45.640 --> 00:28:49.310 align:middle line:84%
you to become the most empowered
being that you can possibly

00:28:49.310 --> 00:28:50.110 align:middle line:90%
become?

00:28:50.110 --> 00:28:52.300 align:middle line:84%
Or, have you given your
power away to your tool

00:28:52.300 --> 00:28:54.939 align:middle line:84%
and allowed it to become
a crutch in your life?

00:28:54.939 --> 00:28:56.480 align:middle line:84%
If you don't know
the answer to that,

00:28:56.480 --> 00:28:58.819 align:middle line:84%
ask yourself, if I'm
out in the world,

00:28:58.819 --> 00:29:01.360 align:middle line:84%
if I'm walking down the street
and something crosses my path,

00:29:01.360 --> 00:29:04.600 align:middle line:84%
and that throws me into
an emotional chaos,

00:29:04.600 --> 00:29:07.570 align:middle line:84%
can I deal with it
without having my gadget?

00:29:07.570 --> 00:29:09.780 align:middle line:84%
And if the answer
is yes, then it

00:29:09.780 --> 00:29:11.530 align:middle line:84%
tells you that your
tools have served you.

00:29:11.530 --> 00:29:13.954 align:middle line:84%
And if the answer is no, that
tells you, in that moment,

00:29:13.954 --> 00:29:16.370 align:middle line:84%
that your tool is a crutch not
right, wrong, good, or bad,

00:29:16.370 --> 00:29:17.500 align:middle line:90%
you're just being honest--

00:29:17.500 --> 00:29:18.940 align:middle line:90%
it's a crutch for me right now.

00:29:18.940 --> 00:29:23.080 align:middle line:84%
How can I move from
this place of a crutch

00:29:23.080 --> 00:29:25.160 align:middle line:84%
to an empowered state
where it's nice to have?

00:29:25.160 --> 00:29:27.180 align:middle line:84%
And if I don't have
it, I'm OK without it?

00:29:27.180 --> 00:29:30.970 align:middle line:84%
And this is the way I feel
about everything, in our world,

00:29:30.970 --> 00:29:32.860 align:middle line:90%
including medicine.

00:29:32.860 --> 00:29:35.170 align:middle line:84%
I think medicine
is an amazing tool

00:29:35.170 --> 00:29:39.220 align:middle line:84%
to help us restore a health
and the feeling to our body.

00:29:39.220 --> 00:29:42.220 align:middle line:84%
And once we know what it
feels like to be healthy,

00:29:42.220 --> 00:29:46.150 align:middle line:84%
once we know what it feels like
to be well, when we can claim

00:29:46.150 --> 00:29:50.030 align:middle line:84%
that feeling in
our bodies, there

00:29:50.030 --> 00:29:53.200 align:middle line:84%
is a facet that I didn't get
to talk about of our existence.

00:29:53.200 --> 00:29:56.380 align:middle line:84%
I didn't get to talk about
in the "Missing Link"

00:29:56.380 --> 00:30:01.030 align:middle line:84%
series mirror
neurons in our brain.

00:30:01.030 --> 00:30:04.750 align:middle line:84%
Mirror neurons are a
special kind of neuron.

00:30:04.750 --> 00:30:08.200 align:middle line:84%
When they witness
something happening,

00:30:08.200 --> 00:30:10.467 align:middle line:84%
our brain can't
tell whether or not

00:30:10.467 --> 00:30:12.550 align:middle line:84%
we're seeing it in someone
else or experiencing it

00:30:12.550 --> 00:30:13.430 align:middle line:90%
within ourselves.

00:30:13.430 --> 00:30:18.820 align:middle line:84%
So when we listen to music
that we like, for example,

00:30:18.820 --> 00:30:21.370 align:middle line:84%
it will light up very
specific places in our brain.

00:30:21.370 --> 00:30:25.480 align:middle line:84%
The studies show that when
someone is playing the music,

00:30:25.480 --> 00:30:28.327 align:middle line:84%
the same places light
up in their brain

00:30:28.327 --> 00:30:30.160 align:middle line:84%
light up in our brain,
even though we're not

00:30:30.160 --> 00:30:31.118 align:middle line:90%
playing the instrument.

00:30:31.118 --> 00:30:34.510 align:middle line:84%
So, simply by having
the experience,

00:30:34.510 --> 00:30:36.950 align:middle line:84%
our same places in
the brain light up,

00:30:36.950 --> 00:30:39.070 align:middle line:84%
whether we're witnessing
or whether we're

00:30:39.070 --> 00:30:39.910 align:middle line:90%
having experience.

00:30:39.910 --> 00:30:42.140 align:middle line:84%
This is important when
it comes to healing.

00:30:42.140 --> 00:30:44.620 align:middle line:84%
If we can claim the
feeling of healing,

00:30:44.620 --> 00:30:47.330 align:middle line:84%
or if we can witness
that healing in others,

00:30:47.330 --> 00:30:51.580 align:middle line:84%
if we can appreciate what the
whole, complete, fully enabled,

00:30:51.580 --> 00:30:54.670 align:middle line:84%
fully capacitated human
looks like and behaves

00:30:54.670 --> 00:30:56.530 align:middle line:84%
like and claim
that for ourselves,

00:30:56.530 --> 00:30:59.180 align:middle line:84%
our brain will begin to release
the chemistry in our body

00:30:59.180 --> 00:30:59.980 align:middle line:90%
that matches that.

00:30:59.980 --> 00:31:01.438 align:middle line:84%
Because our brain
doesn't know that

00:31:01.438 --> 00:31:03.680 align:middle line:84%
we're witnessing
it in someone else.

00:31:03.680 --> 00:31:07.420 align:middle line:84%
So, all of this is my
way of saying to you,

00:31:07.420 --> 00:31:14.100 align:middle line:84%
whatever you do in your life to
move you along in your growth

00:31:14.100 --> 00:31:16.960 align:middle line:84%
and in your spiritual
progression,

00:31:16.960 --> 00:31:19.210 align:middle line:84%
I think it's a
good thing to do--

00:31:19.210 --> 00:31:21.040 align:middle line:90%
be conscious and aware.

00:31:21.040 --> 00:31:24.880 align:middle line:84%
Ask yourself, is this my
tool, or is it my crutch?

00:31:24.880 --> 00:31:28.150 align:middle line:84%
And your answer will tell
you what your next step is.

00:31:28.150 --> 00:31:30.340 align:middle line:84%
So, we've covered a lot
of ground in this episode.

00:31:30.340 --> 00:31:33.070 align:middle line:84%
And we began talking
about factors of lifestyle

00:31:33.070 --> 00:31:37.970 align:middle line:84%
to empower us, to help us to
thrive in the changing world.

00:31:37.970 --> 00:31:41.410 align:middle line:84%
If I had to mention a single
word that encapsulates

00:31:41.410 --> 00:31:43.480 align:middle line:84%
everything that we
have done today,

00:31:43.480 --> 00:31:45.280 align:middle line:84%
for me, that word
would be choice.

00:31:45.280 --> 00:31:47.690 align:middle line:90%
Because it is all about choice.

00:31:47.690 --> 00:31:50.830 align:middle line:84%
There are people in the world
and in our families around us

00:31:50.830 --> 00:31:53.620 align:middle line:84%
that will never make that choice
that you and I are talking

00:31:53.620 --> 00:31:55.875 align:middle line:84%
about making, and that's
a choice for them.

00:31:55.875 --> 00:31:57.250 align:middle line:84%
And I want to be
very clear, it's

00:31:57.250 --> 00:31:58.670 align:middle line:90%
not right, wrong, good, or bad.

00:31:58.670 --> 00:32:02.380 align:middle line:84%
It is about what
makes our hearts sing,

00:32:02.380 --> 00:32:05.020 align:middle line:84%
where we find our
greatest joy in life.

00:32:05.020 --> 00:32:08.680 align:middle line:84%
So, I'm inviting you to honor
the choices that you make

00:32:08.680 --> 00:32:12.250 align:middle line:84%
for yourself, and to
be conscious and aware

00:32:12.250 --> 00:32:15.370 align:middle line:84%
that every moment of every
day, you are making the choice.

00:32:15.370 --> 00:32:19.870 align:middle line:90%
