>>GREGG BRADEN: Hello.

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:27.178 align:middle line:90%
My name's Gregg Braden.

00:00:27.178 --> 00:00:30.300 align:middle line:10%
And I'd like to welcome you to
this very special presentation

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:32.040 align:middle line:10%
of "The Divine Matrix"--

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:35.670 align:middle line:10%
Bridging Time, Space,
Miracles, and Belief.

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:37.410 align:middle line:84%
In the last episode,
we discovered

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:41.010 align:middle line:84%
the rules of the matrix and
how the seemingly insignificant

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:42.780 align:middle line:84%
choices we make in
our everyday lives

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:46.920 align:middle line:84%
can show up in the world around
us in very unexpected ways.

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:49.470 align:middle line:84%
Well, in this
episode, we'll explore

00:00:49.470 --> 00:00:52.860 align:middle line:84%
how we're in a constant
dialogue with the field,

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:54.960 align:middle line:84%
and how to recognize
the messages that come

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:58.800 align:middle line:90%
to us from inside the matrix.

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:02.280 align:middle line:84%
The Divine Matrix
fulfills three properties

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:04.420 align:middle line:84%
in the world around us
when we think of ourselves

00:01:04.420 --> 00:01:05.220 align:middle line:90%
in the universe.

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:07.170 align:middle line:84%
Number one, as we
mentioned, it's

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:08.710 align:middle line:90%
the container for all things.

00:01:08.710 --> 00:01:13.080 align:middle line:84%
Number two, it's the bridge
between the world within us

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:14.970 align:middle line:90%
and the world beyond us.

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:19.260 align:middle line:84%
Number three, it is a
mirror in the outer world

00:01:19.260 --> 00:01:22.200 align:middle line:84%
for what it is that we
create, both consciously

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:24.900 align:middle line:84%
and subconsciously,
in our inner world--

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:28.350 align:middle line:84%
our thoughts, our
feelings, emotions,

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:31.750 align:middle line:84%
and our conscious and
subconscious beliefs.

00:01:31.750 --> 00:01:34.320 align:middle line:84%
So what we know from
this perspective

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:36.570 align:middle line:84%
is that we are
literally living in what

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:39.415 align:middle line:90%
is called a reflected reality.

00:01:39.415 --> 00:01:41.040 align:middle line:84%
Now, this is a little
bit different way

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:42.160 align:middle line:90%
of thinking about things.

00:01:42.160 --> 00:01:45.090 align:middle line:84%
Because when we talk
about a reflected reality,

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:49.620 align:middle line:84%
we typically think of a
projector in one place

00:01:49.620 --> 00:01:55.080 align:middle line:84%
in a linear fashion, projecting
into or upon the screen

00:01:55.080 --> 00:01:59.220 align:middle line:84%
that is across the room or
on the other side of a field.

00:01:59.220 --> 00:02:04.230 align:middle line:10%
The way that this mirror works
is, on the quantum level,

00:02:04.230 --> 00:02:07.660 align:middle line:10%
the mirror is
everywhere all the time.

00:02:07.660 --> 00:02:10.680 align:middle line:84%
It's not just in one place
in the moment in time.

00:02:10.680 --> 00:02:11.610 align:middle line:90%
It's behind us.

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:12.480 align:middle line:90%
It's in front of us.

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:13.470 align:middle line:90%
It's within us.

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:15.750 align:middle line:90%
It is without us.

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:19.740 align:middle line:84%
And maybe the best way to
share what I mean by this

00:02:19.740 --> 00:02:21.240 align:middle line:90%
is through specific examples.

00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:22.860 align:middle line:84%
And these are true
stories that I'd

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:26.880 align:middle line:84%
like to share with you, in
terms of people's relationships

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:30.480 align:middle line:84%
with the things that they share
their most intimate experiences

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:31.350 align:middle line:90%
with--

00:02:31.350 --> 00:02:35.380 align:middle line:84%
our homes, our automobiles,
and other people.

00:02:35.380 --> 00:02:38.460 align:middle line:84%
So maybe you've had
this experience,

00:02:38.460 --> 00:02:42.460 align:middle line:84%
where you have an
automobile, for example,

00:02:42.460 --> 00:02:45.210 align:middle line:84%
that runs perfectly as long
as you're the one driving.

00:02:45.210 --> 00:02:47.460 align:middle line:84%
And as soon as someone
else gets behind the wheel,

00:02:47.460 --> 00:02:49.170 align:middle line:90%
something begins to happen.

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:52.100 align:middle line:84%
Or you have an automobile
while you're driving

00:02:52.100 --> 00:02:53.100 align:middle line:90%
that's having a problem.

00:02:53.100 --> 00:02:56.880 align:middle line:84%
And the moment you take it
to a mechanic or someone that

00:02:56.880 --> 00:03:00.240 align:middle line:84%
is qualified to diagnose that
problem and they begin driving,

00:03:00.240 --> 00:03:01.050 align:middle line:90%
nothing happens.

00:03:01.050 --> 00:03:02.655 align:middle line:84%
Have you ever had
that happen to you?

00:03:02.655 --> 00:03:06.640 align:middle line:84%
Well, if you have,
you're not alone.

00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:10.440 align:middle line:10%
I had a 1984 Pontiac
6000 when I was

00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:13.830 align:middle line:10%
working in the corporations
in Denver, Colorado.

00:03:13.830 --> 00:03:16.350 align:middle line:84%
And I took really good
care of my Pontiac.

00:03:16.350 --> 00:03:20.760 align:middle line:84%
And it had over 300,000
miles on it before I

00:03:20.760 --> 00:03:23.280 align:middle line:90%
traded it in on another vehicle.

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:26.490 align:middle line:84%
My home in northern New Mexico,
in a rural area in northern New

00:03:26.490 --> 00:03:29.880 align:middle line:84%
Mexico, is about four hours
from the Albuquerque airport,

00:03:29.880 --> 00:03:32.610 align:middle line:84%
where I typically
fly in and out.

00:03:32.610 --> 00:03:34.860 align:middle line:84%
So when I would
drive back and forth,

00:03:34.860 --> 00:03:37.440 align:middle line:84%
I would end up putting a
lot of miles on my vehicle.

00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:40.952 align:middle line:84%
And I eventually began to
have someone else drive me

00:03:40.952 --> 00:03:43.410 align:middle line:84%
to the airport and drive me
back-- sometimes in my vehicle,

00:03:43.410 --> 00:03:45.210 align:middle line:90%
sometimes in theirs.

00:03:45.210 --> 00:03:48.150 align:middle line:84%
And inevitably,
the person driving,

00:03:48.150 --> 00:03:50.190 align:middle line:84%
I would go to the
airport, and I'd call.

00:03:50.190 --> 00:03:53.190 align:middle line:84%
And they'd say, OK, well,
I've made it back home.

00:03:53.190 --> 00:03:55.140 align:middle line:10%
But have you had problems
with your brakes,

00:03:55.140 --> 00:03:57.180 align:middle line:10%
or have you had problems
with the ignition?

00:03:57.180 --> 00:03:58.552 align:middle line:10%
Or something would happen.

00:03:58.552 --> 00:04:00.510 align:middle line:84%
And when I would get home
and drive my own car,

00:04:00.510 --> 00:04:02.370 align:middle line:90%
everything would be fine.

00:04:02.370 --> 00:04:04.770 align:middle line:84%
So these kinds of
experiences, they

00:04:04.770 --> 00:04:06.749 align:middle line:90%
extend beyond our vehicles.

00:04:06.749 --> 00:04:08.290 align:middle line:84%
But when they do
happen to a vehicle,

00:04:08.290 --> 00:04:09.860 align:middle line:84%
let me just share
with you an insight

00:04:09.860 --> 00:04:11.760 align:middle line:90%
of what might be happening.

00:04:11.760 --> 00:04:16.019 align:middle line:84%
If you consider the function
of the part of the vehicle that

00:04:16.019 --> 00:04:19.420 align:middle line:84%
is having a problem-- maybe it's
the transmission, for example,

00:04:19.420 --> 00:04:20.610 align:middle line:90%
or maybe it's the brakes.

00:04:20.610 --> 00:04:21.839 align:middle line:90%
Maybe it's the ignition.

00:04:21.839 --> 00:04:27.330 align:middle line:84%
Consider the function that that
part plays in the automobile.

00:04:27.330 --> 00:04:31.080 align:middle line:84%
And then ask yourself how that
function applies to what's

00:04:31.080 --> 00:04:33.400 align:middle line:90%
happening in your life.

00:04:33.400 --> 00:04:35.940 align:middle line:10%
For example, I live in
an artist's community

00:04:35.940 --> 00:04:37.480 align:middle line:10%
in northern New Mexico.

00:04:37.480 --> 00:04:39.750 align:middle line:84%
And it's very common
that the artists--

00:04:39.750 --> 00:04:44.460 align:middle line:84%
the musicians, the
designers, the writers

00:04:44.460 --> 00:04:48.210 align:middle line:84%
that are so creative
in their lives--

00:04:48.210 --> 00:04:50.807 align:middle line:84%
often have a difficult
time making a living

00:04:50.807 --> 00:04:52.890 align:middle line:84%
and supporting themselves
through their creations.

00:04:52.890 --> 00:04:55.590 align:middle line:84%
So they have to have
other jobs to do that.

00:04:55.590 --> 00:04:57.630 align:middle line:84%
And it's very common
for those people

00:04:57.630 --> 00:04:59.221 align:middle line:84%
to have problems
with their vehicles.

00:04:59.221 --> 00:05:00.720 align:middle line:84%
And nine times out
of 10, it's going

00:05:00.720 --> 00:05:02.227 align:middle line:90%
to be a transmission problem.

00:05:02.227 --> 00:05:03.060 align:middle line:90%
What does that mean?

00:05:03.060 --> 00:05:04.680 align:middle line:90%
Well, think about this.

00:05:04.680 --> 00:05:06.846 align:middle line:84%
The engine of the car
is creating the energy.

00:05:06.846 --> 00:05:08.220 align:middle line:84%
And their engine
is running fine.

00:05:08.220 --> 00:05:10.670 align:middle line:84%
Their creative engines
are rolling all the time.

00:05:10.670 --> 00:05:13.440 align:middle line:84%
The transmission
in the vehicle is

00:05:13.440 --> 00:05:16.380 align:middle line:84%
what takes the energy
from the engine

00:05:16.380 --> 00:05:18.690 align:middle line:84%
and transfers it
in a meaningful way

00:05:18.690 --> 00:05:23.359 align:middle line:84%
to the differential in the
wheels so the vehicle to move.

00:05:23.359 --> 00:05:25.650 align:middle line:84%
What's happening in their
lives is, their transmission,

00:05:25.650 --> 00:05:30.660 align:middle line:84%
their ability to translate their
powerful, masterful creations

00:05:30.660 --> 00:05:32.850 align:middle line:84%
into something
meaningful in their lives

00:05:32.850 --> 00:05:34.650 align:middle line:84%
is where they are
having the problems.

00:05:34.650 --> 00:05:36.100 align:middle line:90%
It's where they're stuck.

00:05:36.100 --> 00:05:37.920 align:middle line:84%
So it doesn't apply
100% of the time.

00:05:37.920 --> 00:05:40.350 align:middle line:84%
But these are
metaphors that show up

00:05:40.350 --> 00:05:43.230 align:middle line:84%
in our physical world for
what's happening within us.

00:05:43.230 --> 00:05:45.960 align:middle line:84%
Let me just share with you
a couple of other stories.

00:05:45.960 --> 00:05:49.920 align:middle line:84%
I had a friend in
the early 1990s who

00:05:49.920 --> 00:05:51.400 align:middle line:90%
I would see about once a week.

00:05:51.400 --> 00:05:52.200 align:middle line:90%
It was a woman.

00:05:52.200 --> 00:05:54.240 align:middle line:84%
I was just very good
friends with her.

00:05:54.240 --> 00:05:56.620 align:middle line:84%
And I went to see her
on a Thursday afternoon.

00:05:56.620 --> 00:05:58.890 align:middle line:84%
And I said, well, how
are things in your life?

00:05:58.890 --> 00:06:00.306 align:middle line:84%
And she said, you
wouldn't believe

00:06:00.306 --> 00:06:01.610 align:middle line:90%
what's happening in my life.

00:06:01.610 --> 00:06:03.080 align:middle line:90%
I said, well, try me.

00:06:03.080 --> 00:06:05.060 align:middle line:84%
She said, my
boyfriend and I were

00:06:05.060 --> 00:06:06.800 align:middle line:84%
sitting on the couch
in the living room.

00:06:06.800 --> 00:06:09.500 align:middle line:84%
We heard this crash
in the bathroom.

00:06:09.500 --> 00:06:11.960 align:middle line:84%
And we went into the
bathroom and looked.

00:06:11.960 --> 00:06:16.160 align:middle line:84%
And the hot water pipe had
blown apart under the vanity,

00:06:16.160 --> 00:06:18.740 align:middle line:84%
had blown the door off of
the hinges in the vanity

00:06:18.740 --> 00:06:21.720 align:middle line:84%
into the sheet rock on the
other side of the bathroom wall.

00:06:21.720 --> 00:06:22.950 align:middle line:90%
And I said, wow.

00:06:22.950 --> 00:06:25.010 align:middle line:84%
I said, that's a
pretty big story.

00:06:25.010 --> 00:06:26.810 align:middle line:90%
She goes, I'm not finished yet.

00:06:26.810 --> 00:06:30.950 align:middle line:84%
She said, we went to the
garage to get into the vehicle

00:06:30.950 --> 00:06:33.530 align:middle line:84%
to go to the hardware store
and get what we needed

00:06:33.530 --> 00:06:35.990 align:middle line:84%
to fix the vanity door,
and there was hot water

00:06:35.990 --> 00:06:38.000 align:middle line:90%
all over the garage floor.

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:40.290 align:middle line:90%
The water heater had exploded.

00:06:40.290 --> 00:06:41.090 align:middle line:90%
And I said, wow.

00:06:41.090 --> 00:06:42.170 align:middle line:84%
I said, what do you
think that's all about?

00:06:42.170 --> 00:06:43.640 align:middle line:90%
She says, I'm not done yet.

00:06:43.640 --> 00:06:46.460 align:middle line:84%
She said, while we were
backing down the driveway,

00:06:46.460 --> 00:06:49.940 align:middle line:84%
the lower radiator hose in
the car we were in blew up,

00:06:49.940 --> 00:06:53.960 align:middle line:84%
and there was hot radiator
fluid all over the driveway.

00:06:53.960 --> 00:06:55.620 align:middle line:90%
And I said, wow.

00:06:55.620 --> 00:06:58.070 align:middle line:84%
I said, this is a very
interesting story,

00:06:58.070 --> 00:06:58.940 align:middle line:90%
from my perspective.

00:06:58.940 --> 00:07:02.560 align:middle line:84%
Because we live in
this reflected reality.

00:07:02.560 --> 00:07:05.390 align:middle line:84%
And so I asked her, what's
happening in your life

00:07:05.390 --> 00:07:06.440 align:middle line:90%
right now?

00:07:06.440 --> 00:07:08.690 align:middle line:84%
And she said, this
relationship I'm in.

00:07:08.690 --> 00:07:11.090 align:middle line:84%
She called it the
never-ending date.

00:07:11.090 --> 00:07:12.950 align:middle line:84%
They had been
together for 11 years.

00:07:12.950 --> 00:07:15.116 align:middle line:84%
They couldn't move forward
to a deeper commitment,

00:07:15.116 --> 00:07:16.740 align:middle line:84%
but they couldn't
end the relationship.

00:07:16.740 --> 00:07:18.140 align:middle line:90%
They were stuck.

00:07:18.140 --> 00:07:21.380 align:middle line:84%
And the emotional
pressure from being stuck

00:07:21.380 --> 00:07:24.380 align:middle line:84%
was present in both of
their lives all the time.

00:07:24.380 --> 00:07:26.390 align:middle line:84%
And as she was
telling me this story

00:07:26.390 --> 00:07:29.510 align:middle line:84%
about being stuck in the
relationship and the pressure

00:07:29.510 --> 00:07:32.210 align:middle line:84%
that she was feeling in her
relationship, she looked at me

00:07:32.210 --> 00:07:33.710 align:middle line:84%
and she said, you
wouldn't believe

00:07:33.710 --> 00:07:35.300 align:middle line:90%
what's happening in this house.

00:07:35.300 --> 00:07:38.690 align:middle line:84%
She said, our house, it
feels like a pressure cooker.

00:07:38.690 --> 00:07:40.290 align:middle line:84%
And then she stopped
and she said,

00:07:40.290 --> 00:07:41.915 align:middle line:84%
you don't suppose
that what's happening

00:07:41.915 --> 00:07:44.249 align:middle line:84%
in my relationship has anything
to do with what happened

00:07:44.249 --> 00:07:46.789 align:middle line:84%
in the bathroom, with the hot
water heater, and with the car,

00:07:46.789 --> 00:07:47.990 align:middle line:90%
do you?

00:07:47.990 --> 00:07:50.480 align:middle line:84%
And I said, well,
in my world, it

00:07:50.480 --> 00:07:52.460 align:middle line:84%
has everything to do
with it, because we

00:07:52.460 --> 00:07:54.720 align:middle line:90%
live in this reflected reality.

00:07:54.720 --> 00:07:57.170 align:middle line:84%
It's very, very different
way of thinking about things.

00:07:57.170 --> 00:07:59.840 align:middle line:90%


00:07:59.840 --> 00:08:04.920 align:middle line:84%
In the late 1990s,
my mother and I,

00:08:04.920 --> 00:08:08.270 align:middle line:84%
we talked about once
a week on the phone.

00:08:08.270 --> 00:08:10.382 align:middle line:84%
She was living alone in
Albuquerque, New Mexico.

00:08:10.382 --> 00:08:11.840 align:middle line:84%
I was traveling
all over the world.

00:08:11.840 --> 00:08:13.940 align:middle line:84%
And I'd try to call
her every Sunday, just

00:08:13.940 --> 00:08:16.040 align:middle line:84%
to check in with
her and see what

00:08:16.040 --> 00:08:17.550 align:middle line:90%
was happening in her world.

00:08:17.550 --> 00:08:20.870 align:middle line:84%
And one day I called
her, a Sunday afternoon,

00:08:20.870 --> 00:08:22.980 align:middle line:84%
and I asked, how
are things going?

00:08:22.980 --> 00:08:24.980 align:middle line:90%
And she said, I'm OK.

00:08:24.980 --> 00:08:27.680 align:middle line:84%
But she says, I'm
concerned about my dog.

00:08:27.680 --> 00:08:29.960 align:middle line:84%
My mom's dog, next
to her two sons--

00:08:29.960 --> 00:08:31.790 align:middle line:90%
myself and my younger brother--

00:08:31.790 --> 00:08:34.580 align:middle line:84%
her dog was like the third
son that she never had.

00:08:34.580 --> 00:08:36.860 align:middle line:90%
Her dog's name was Corey Sue.

00:08:36.860 --> 00:08:38.450 align:middle line:90%
Corey Sue was a little terrier.

00:08:38.450 --> 00:08:41.309 align:middle line:84%
And Mom loved this
dog so much, and they

00:08:41.309 --> 00:08:42.950 align:middle line:90%
were constant companions.

00:08:42.950 --> 00:08:47.270 align:middle line:84%
So this dog was with
my mom almost 24/7.

00:08:47.270 --> 00:08:49.730 align:middle line:84%
I said to my mom, what's
happening with your dog?

00:08:49.730 --> 00:08:51.620 align:middle line:90%
What's happening with Corey Sue?

00:08:51.620 --> 00:08:53.330 align:middle line:90%
She said, I took her to the vet.

00:08:53.330 --> 00:08:55.430 align:middle line:90%
She was a little lethargic.

00:08:55.430 --> 00:08:57.230 align:middle line:90%
She was sleeping all the time.

00:08:57.230 --> 00:08:58.730 align:middle line:84%
I thought maybe
something was wrong.

00:08:58.730 --> 00:09:01.940 align:middle line:84%
And the vet X-rayed her,
and she has black spots

00:09:01.940 --> 00:09:03.784 align:middle line:90%
all over her lungs.

00:09:03.784 --> 00:09:05.450 align:middle line:84%
She said, I'm very
concerned about that.

00:09:05.450 --> 00:09:07.160 align:middle line:90%
What do you think about that?

00:09:07.160 --> 00:09:09.890 align:middle line:84%
So I said, of course, I'm
concerned about Corey Sue.

00:09:09.890 --> 00:09:16.130 align:middle line:84%
But I said, in my world,
the vehicles that we share

00:09:16.130 --> 00:09:18.620 align:middle line:84%
our time with, the homes
that we share our time with,

00:09:18.620 --> 00:09:21.830 align:middle line:84%
the animals and other people
that we share our time with,

00:09:21.830 --> 00:09:27.680 align:middle line:84%
they often will reflect in
themselves the conditions that

00:09:27.680 --> 00:09:31.250 align:middle line:84%
often happen before they ever
show up within our bodies.

00:09:31.250 --> 00:09:33.110 align:middle line:90%
So I said, how are you, Mom?

00:09:33.110 --> 00:09:34.520 align:middle line:90%
What's happening with you?

00:09:34.520 --> 00:09:35.930 align:middle line:84%
She said, you know, I
went to have a physical

00:09:35.930 --> 00:09:37.310 align:middle line:90%
and everything checked out fine.

00:09:37.310 --> 00:09:39.530 align:middle line:84%
I said, did you have
an X-ray of your lungs?

00:09:39.530 --> 00:09:42.530 align:middle line:84%
She said, that's the one part
of the physical that I put off.

00:09:42.530 --> 00:09:45.020 align:middle line:84%
She said, I'm going to go
back and do that later.

00:09:45.020 --> 00:09:47.990 align:middle line:84%
And I said, well, why
are you going to wait?

00:09:47.990 --> 00:09:50.090 align:middle line:84%
She said, well,
I'm going to wait

00:09:50.090 --> 00:09:52.430 align:middle line:84%
until I get the house
painted, until I get

00:09:52.430 --> 00:09:54.680 align:middle line:84%
the yard done, until I
get the flowers planted,

00:09:54.680 --> 00:09:57.290 align:middle line:84%
until I get the new
side put in, until I

00:09:57.290 --> 00:09:58.560 align:middle line:90%
get some work done on the car.

00:09:58.560 --> 00:10:01.130 align:middle line:84%
And I said, Mom,
you're procrastinating.

00:10:01.130 --> 00:10:02.239 align:middle line:90%
Just have it done.

00:10:02.239 --> 00:10:03.530 align:middle line:90%
And I called her the next week.

00:10:03.530 --> 00:10:05.029 align:middle line:84%
I said, Mom, did
you get your X-ray?

00:10:05.029 --> 00:10:06.290 align:middle line:90%
And she said no.

00:10:06.290 --> 00:10:08.750 align:middle line:90%
I said, Mom, go have the X-ray.

00:10:08.750 --> 00:10:09.890 align:middle line:90%
She went and had the X-ray.

00:10:09.890 --> 00:10:12.770 align:middle line:84%
Lo and behold, the
X-ray showed a spot

00:10:12.770 --> 00:10:17.810 align:middle line:84%
on her lung that was
a cancerous spot.

00:10:17.810 --> 00:10:19.520 align:middle line:90%
She had had TB as a child.

00:10:19.520 --> 00:10:24.110 align:middle line:84%
The TB had healed, developed
the scar tissue around the TB.

00:10:24.110 --> 00:10:27.900 align:middle line:84%
And now, at her age, that scar
tissue had become cancerous.

00:10:27.900 --> 00:10:30.890 align:middle line:84%
So I went with Mom
through a whole process

00:10:30.890 --> 00:10:33.560 align:middle line:84%
of finding doctors and
finding the hospital.

00:10:33.560 --> 00:10:35.270 align:middle line:84%
And she opted to
have the surgery

00:10:35.270 --> 00:10:39.680 align:middle line:84%
to have this cancerous place
removed, and, in doing so,

00:10:39.680 --> 00:10:42.830 align:middle line:84%
ended up losing 2/3
of her left lung.

00:10:42.830 --> 00:10:45.050 align:middle line:84%
Here's why I'm
sharing this story.

00:10:45.050 --> 00:10:47.840 align:middle line:84%
After her recovery--
Mom did recover 100%.

00:10:47.840 --> 00:10:49.170 align:middle line:90%
And she was cancer free.

00:10:49.170 --> 00:10:51.890 align:middle line:90%
She's cancer free to this day.

00:10:51.890 --> 00:10:54.102 align:middle line:84%
I asked her, what's
happening with Corey Sue?

00:10:54.102 --> 00:10:56.060 align:middle line:84%
And she said, you're not
going to believe this.

00:10:56.060 --> 00:10:57.710 align:middle line:90%
I said, try me.

00:10:57.710 --> 00:11:01.010 align:middle line:84%
She said, I took her back to
the vet and had the X-rays done,

00:11:01.010 --> 00:11:04.380 align:middle line:84%
and all the black spots in
her lungs had disappeared.

00:11:04.380 --> 00:11:06.140 align:middle line:90%
They're not there any longer.

00:11:06.140 --> 00:11:08.510 align:middle line:84%
And I said, you know, I'm
in awe when I hear it,

00:11:08.510 --> 00:11:10.100 align:middle line:90%
but I'm not surprised.

00:11:10.100 --> 00:11:12.200 align:middle line:84%
Because there's a
very good possibility

00:11:12.200 --> 00:11:16.640 align:middle line:84%
that your dog unconditionally
loves so deeply,

00:11:16.640 --> 00:11:19.700 align:middle line:84%
without the expectations,
without the judgments,

00:11:19.700 --> 00:11:22.160 align:middle line:84%
without the good or the bad
or the right or the wrong.

00:11:22.160 --> 00:11:25.640 align:middle line:84%
Our animals simply reflect
the field of energy

00:11:25.640 --> 00:11:28.730 align:middle line:84%
that is the field
that we are creating.

00:11:28.730 --> 00:11:30.310 align:middle line:90%
They reflect it in their lives.

00:11:30.310 --> 00:11:33.440 align:middle line:84%
And if we know that,
then we are often

00:11:33.440 --> 00:11:37.970 align:middle line:84%
given the opportunity to receive
messages from them about what's

00:11:37.970 --> 00:11:39.060 align:middle line:90%
happening in our lives.

00:11:39.060 --> 00:11:40.550 align:middle line:90%
And if we don't know that--

00:11:40.550 --> 00:11:44.210 align:middle line:84%
I've had friends that have
had to keep getting new pets,

00:11:44.210 --> 00:11:47.420 align:middle line:84%
because they say the old
pets, they always get sick.

00:11:47.420 --> 00:11:49.500 align:middle line:84%
They say, my pets get
sick all the time.

00:11:49.500 --> 00:11:50.300 align:middle line:90%
I need a new one.

00:11:50.300 --> 00:11:51.860 align:middle line:90%
I need a good one.

00:11:51.860 --> 00:11:56.360 align:middle line:84%
When in truth, those pets may
be unconditionally reflecting

00:11:56.360 --> 00:12:00.320 align:middle line:84%
to the owner, my friends in
this case, the conditions that

00:12:00.320 --> 00:12:02.450 align:middle line:84%
have yet to show up in
the owner's body, but

00:12:02.450 --> 00:12:06.840 align:middle line:84%
are there in the energetic
field, in the Divine Matrix.

00:12:06.840 --> 00:12:11.240 align:middle line:84%
So this is an example of how
our relationship to this field

00:12:11.240 --> 00:12:16.100 align:middle line:84%
can show up in very common ways,
everyday in our lives, in ways

00:12:16.100 --> 00:12:17.720 align:middle line:90%
that we may discount.

00:12:17.720 --> 00:12:20.990 align:middle line:84%
But as we gain the wisdom
to recognize this deeper

00:12:20.990 --> 00:12:23.550 align:middle line:84%
relationship we have
with the matrix,

00:12:23.550 --> 00:12:25.880 align:middle line:84%
then the matrix
begins to tell us

00:12:25.880 --> 00:12:29.330 align:middle line:84%
about where we are in our
lives, about the quality

00:12:29.330 --> 00:12:30.710 align:middle line:90%
of the choices that we make.

00:12:30.710 --> 00:12:33.290 align:middle line:84%
It begins to inform
us so that we

00:12:33.290 --> 00:12:36.320 align:middle line:84%
can become wiser in the
choices that we're making.

00:12:36.320 --> 00:12:38.750 align:middle line:84%
And this is especially
true when it

00:12:38.750 --> 00:12:41.390 align:middle line:84%
comes to our personal
relationships,

00:12:41.390 --> 00:12:45.560 align:middle line:84%
the most intimate relationships
that we have in our lives.

00:12:45.560 --> 00:12:49.040 align:middle line:84%
Because where we find the
deepest hurt, the deepest pain,

00:12:49.040 --> 00:12:51.290 align:middle line:84%
the greatest joy, and
the greatest ecstasy,

00:12:51.290 --> 00:12:54.320 align:middle line:84%
this is where the
matrix is going

00:12:54.320 --> 00:12:58.480 align:middle line:84%
to show us our deepest,
sometimes unconscious beliefs.

00:12:58.480 --> 00:13:01.670 align:middle line:84%
And this is what I want to
talk to you about right now.

00:13:01.670 --> 00:13:05.180 align:middle line:84%
I want to talk to you
about the ancient mirrors

00:13:05.180 --> 00:13:07.370 align:middle line:90%
of human relationship.

00:13:07.370 --> 00:13:08.510 align:middle line:90%
And they are ancient.

00:13:08.510 --> 00:13:13.490 align:middle line:84%
Because the experiences that
play out in our everyday lives

00:13:13.490 --> 00:13:16.940 align:middle line:84%
right now in the modern
world, although they play out

00:13:16.940 --> 00:13:20.480 align:middle line:84%
in modern ways, the principles
are the same principles that

00:13:20.480 --> 00:13:23.250 align:middle line:90%
played out 2,500 years ago.

00:13:23.250 --> 00:13:26.060 align:middle line:84%
And that's where
this mystery begins.

00:13:26.060 --> 00:13:29.570 align:middle line:84%
2,500 years ago, there
was a mysterious sect

00:13:29.570 --> 00:13:33.260 align:middle line:84%
of people that showed
up in the Middle East.

00:13:33.260 --> 00:13:35.474 align:middle line:84%
They were not understood
well in their day.

00:13:35.474 --> 00:13:36.890 align:middle line:84%
And they're still
a mystery today.

00:13:36.890 --> 00:13:38.900 align:middle line:90%
They are called the Essenes.

00:13:38.900 --> 00:13:43.880 align:middle line:84%
E-S-S-E-N-E-S. And the ancient
Essenes are believed to be

00:13:43.880 --> 00:13:46.700 align:middle line:84%
the scribes for the
Dead Sea Scrolls,

00:13:46.700 --> 00:13:49.310 align:middle line:84%
the oldest records
of the Old Testament,

00:13:49.310 --> 00:13:52.370 align:middle line:84%
in the Hebrew as well
as the Christian Bible.

00:13:52.370 --> 00:13:57.950 align:middle line:10%
They are also believed to be the
scribes for the New Testament--

00:13:57.950 --> 00:14:02.030 align:middle line:10%
the information that is
contained in a library,

00:14:02.030 --> 00:14:05.120 align:middle line:10%
interestingly, that was found
just about the same time

00:14:05.120 --> 00:14:07.059 align:middle line:10%
that the Dead Sea
Scrolls were found.

00:14:07.059 --> 00:14:08.850 align:middle line:10%
So the Dead Sea Scrolls,
the oldest records

00:14:08.850 --> 00:14:13.430 align:middle line:10%
of the Old Testament, in
the village of Nag Hammadi,

00:14:13.430 --> 00:14:17.240 align:middle line:10%
along the banks of the
Nile River in Egypt--

00:14:17.240 --> 00:14:19.160 align:middle line:10%
an ancient library
was discovered

00:14:19.160 --> 00:14:22.620 align:middle line:10%
that is called the
Nag Hammadi library.

00:14:22.620 --> 00:14:24.840 align:middle line:90%
And the story is as fascinating.

00:14:24.840 --> 00:14:27.860 align:middle line:84%
There aren't many trees that
grow along the Nile River.

00:14:27.860 --> 00:14:30.920 align:middle line:84%
A young Egyptian boy
was given the task

00:14:30.920 --> 00:14:35.120 align:middle line:84%
by his mother to go out and find
firewood to burn in the home,

00:14:35.120 --> 00:14:38.690 align:middle line:84%
so that they could heat their
home and cook their meals.

00:14:38.690 --> 00:14:41.330 align:middle line:84%
And this very ingenious
young boy said to himself--

00:14:41.330 --> 00:14:42.440 align:middle line:90%
and I'm paraphrasing.

00:14:42.440 --> 00:14:44.660 align:middle line:84%
I wasn't there--
not many trees here,

00:14:44.660 --> 00:14:46.970 align:middle line:84%
but I know where I can
find things to burn.

00:14:46.970 --> 00:14:50.930 align:middle line:84%
He went to an ancient tomb that
he had found with some friends,

00:14:50.930 --> 00:14:55.430 align:middle line:84%
and he began bringing back
books of ancient parchment.

00:14:55.430 --> 00:14:57.350 align:middle line:84%
And no one knows
for sure how many

00:14:57.350 --> 00:15:00.830 align:middle line:84%
of these books of parchment
were burned for fuel

00:15:00.830 --> 00:15:03.080 align:middle line:84%
and destroyed before the
authorities found out

00:15:03.080 --> 00:15:03.950 align:middle line:90%
about them.

00:15:03.950 --> 00:15:06.650 align:middle line:10%
But the books that
remain today are

00:15:06.650 --> 00:15:09.860 align:middle line:10%
what are called the
Nag Hammadi library.

00:15:09.860 --> 00:15:13.700 align:middle line:10%
And in the Nag Hammadi library
are some of the texts--

00:15:13.700 --> 00:15:14.900 align:middle line:10%
many of the texts--

00:15:14.900 --> 00:15:18.650 align:middle line:10%
that were edited by the Catholic
church in the fourth century

00:15:18.650 --> 00:15:22.520 align:middle line:10%
when the emperor Constantine
took 43 of the books

00:15:22.520 --> 00:15:27.260 align:middle line:10%
from the original biblical canon
and completely removed them

00:15:27.260 --> 00:15:29.990 align:middle line:10%
and condensed and rearranged
the remaining books into the New

00:15:29.990 --> 00:15:32.040 align:middle line:10%
Testament that we have today.

00:15:32.040 --> 00:15:35.630 align:middle line:84%
So we know the information was
lost, because the Nag Hammadi

00:15:35.630 --> 00:15:38.810 align:middle line:84%
library is showing us
that intact information.

00:15:38.810 --> 00:15:41.050 align:middle line:84%
And among the things
it is showing us--

00:15:41.050 --> 00:15:43.400 align:middle line:84%
this is so very,
very powerful, there

00:15:43.400 --> 00:15:48.290 align:middle line:84%
is one of the books that is
called the Gospel of Thomas.

00:15:48.290 --> 00:15:50.060 align:middle line:90%
Thomas was a scribe.

00:15:50.060 --> 00:15:54.440 align:middle line:84%
And it is if the scribe were
following the master Jesus

00:15:54.440 --> 00:15:56.150 align:middle line:90%
when he shared his teachings.

00:15:56.150 --> 00:15:59.950 align:middle line:84%
And I'm going to talk about this
from a historical perspective

00:15:59.950 --> 00:16:02.500 align:middle line:84%
as a highly learned
man and as a scholar,

00:16:02.500 --> 00:16:04.570 align:middle line:84%
not from a religious
perspective,

00:16:04.570 --> 00:16:06.880 align:middle line:84%
for the purposes of
what we're doing here.

00:16:06.880 --> 00:16:09.790 align:middle line:90%
Because Jesus was an Essene.

00:16:09.790 --> 00:16:12.640 align:middle line:84%
The Essenes were
known by the Egyptians

00:16:12.640 --> 00:16:16.324 align:middle line:84%
not by the word Essene, but
by the word Therapeutae.

00:16:16.324 --> 00:16:17.860 align:middle line:90%
Therapeutae.

00:16:17.860 --> 00:16:19.210 align:middle line:90%
Because they were healers.

00:16:19.210 --> 00:16:22.690 align:middle line:84%
They understood the relationship
between the human body

00:16:22.690 --> 00:16:25.750 align:middle line:84%
and this field around
us, as well as within us.

00:16:25.750 --> 00:16:27.430 align:middle line:84%
And these understandings
were reflected

00:16:27.430 --> 00:16:29.980 align:middle line:84%
in the teachings of
the master Jesus,

00:16:29.980 --> 00:16:34.360 align:middle line:84%
specifically when he was talking
about human relationships.

00:16:34.360 --> 00:16:37.480 align:middle line:84%
And I'm going to share
with you three mirrors

00:16:37.480 --> 00:16:39.970 align:middle line:84%
of human relationship
that he alluded to,

00:16:39.970 --> 00:16:42.280 align:middle line:84%
and how they can play
out in our lives today.

00:16:42.280 --> 00:16:44.110 align:middle line:84%
And if you've never
seen this before,

00:16:44.110 --> 00:16:45.910 align:middle line:90%
I think you'll be in awe--

00:16:45.910 --> 00:16:48.370 align:middle line:84%
maybe not surprised,
but in awe--

00:16:48.370 --> 00:16:51.370 align:middle line:84%
at how accurate
these mirrors are,

00:16:51.370 --> 00:16:53.650 align:middle line:84%
how they could have
been known so long ago,

00:16:53.650 --> 00:16:56.900 align:middle line:84%
and how they're still playing
out in our lives today.

00:16:56.900 --> 00:17:02.390 align:middle line:84%
So let me talk to you about the
first mirror of relationship.

00:17:02.390 --> 00:17:04.200 align:middle line:90%
Jesus spoke in parables.

00:17:04.200 --> 00:17:05.359 align:middle line:90%
He was not a scientist.

00:17:05.359 --> 00:17:09.440 align:middle line:84%
So he used stories to talk
about these specific mirrors.

00:17:09.440 --> 00:17:11.720 align:middle line:84%
So I'd like to share with
you, in his own words,

00:17:11.720 --> 00:17:15.400 align:middle line:84%
how he described the first
mirror of human relationship.

00:17:15.400 --> 00:17:18.619 align:middle line:84%
Mirror number one,
and this is a quote.

00:17:18.619 --> 00:17:22.760 align:middle line:84%
He said, "You read the face
of the sky and of the Earth,

00:17:22.760 --> 00:17:27.540 align:middle line:84%
but you have not recognized
how to read this very moment."

00:17:27.540 --> 00:17:29.670 align:middle line:84%
What he's talking
about in this parable

00:17:29.670 --> 00:17:31.920 align:middle line:84%
is the simplest of
all the mirrors.

00:17:31.920 --> 00:17:35.760 align:middle line:84%
The mirrors become more
complex, more sophisticated,

00:17:35.760 --> 00:17:39.000 align:middle line:84%
as they increase
two, three, and four.

00:17:39.000 --> 00:17:40.870 align:middle line:84%
Mirror number one
is the most obvious.

00:17:40.870 --> 00:17:42.210 align:middle line:90%
It's the mirror of the moment.

00:17:42.210 --> 00:17:45.650 align:middle line:84%
He's talking to us about
the mirror of the moment.

00:17:45.650 --> 00:17:47.820 align:middle line:84%
And this is the mirror
that you probably

00:17:47.820 --> 00:17:48.960 align:middle line:90%
are most familiar with.

00:17:48.960 --> 00:17:51.900 align:middle line:10%
It became popularized
in the mid-1980s

00:17:51.900 --> 00:17:55.170 align:middle line:10%
during the time of the
Harmonic Convergence,

00:17:55.170 --> 00:17:57.840 align:middle line:10%
when the New Thought movement,
the New Age movement,

00:17:57.840 --> 00:17:59.950 align:middle line:10%
was becoming very popular.

00:17:59.950 --> 00:18:03.360 align:middle line:84%
And it was often used
in a very cruel way.

00:18:03.360 --> 00:18:06.000 align:middle line:84%
People would often say, if you
don't like what's happening

00:18:06.000 --> 00:18:07.710 align:middle line:90%
in your life, look at yourself.

00:18:07.710 --> 00:18:10.154 align:middle line:84%
Because your life is just
showing you who you are.

00:18:10.154 --> 00:18:11.820 align:middle line:84%
So if you're surrounded
by angry people,

00:18:11.820 --> 00:18:12.986 align:middle line:90%
it's showing you your anger.

00:18:12.986 --> 00:18:14.970 align:middle line:84%
If you're surrounded
by hurtful people,

00:18:14.970 --> 00:18:16.770 align:middle line:90%
it's showing you your hurt.

00:18:16.770 --> 00:18:18.830 align:middle line:84%
If you're surrounded by
people who aren't honest,

00:18:18.830 --> 00:18:21.090 align:middle line:84%
it's showing you
your dishonesty.

00:18:21.090 --> 00:18:23.340 align:middle line:84%
And they didn't allow
for any other mirrors.

00:18:23.340 --> 00:18:25.380 align:middle line:84%
And this was a very,
very hurtful way

00:18:25.380 --> 00:18:26.920 align:middle line:90%
of thinking about this mirror.

00:18:26.920 --> 00:18:29.320 align:middle line:90%
But this is how we learn.

00:18:29.320 --> 00:18:33.570 align:middle line:84%
This was the community
of New Thought people

00:18:33.570 --> 00:18:36.460 align:middle line:84%
becoming aware of the
mirrors and the complexity

00:18:36.460 --> 00:18:37.260 align:middle line:90%
of the mirrors.

00:18:37.260 --> 00:18:39.400 align:middle line:84%
They were beginning
with mirror number One.

00:18:39.400 --> 00:18:40.860 align:middle line:90%
So sometimes, it's true.

00:18:40.860 --> 00:18:43.140 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes, the world
around us-- our co-workers,

00:18:43.140 --> 00:18:45.390 align:middle line:84%
our friends, our most
intimate relationships--

00:18:45.390 --> 00:18:48.300 align:middle line:84%
are showing us who
we are in the moment.

00:18:48.300 --> 00:18:50.160 align:middle line:90%
And if that's true--

00:18:50.160 --> 00:18:53.400 align:middle line:84%
if you ask yourself, are
these people showing me myself

00:18:53.400 --> 00:18:57.030 align:middle line:84%
in the moment, then you know
where your workshop begins--

00:18:57.030 --> 00:18:58.684 align:middle line:90%
in healing what's happening.

00:18:58.684 --> 00:18:59.850 align:middle line:90%
But there are other mirrors.

00:18:59.850 --> 00:19:02.294 align:middle line:84%
And sometimes, this
is not the case.

00:19:02.294 --> 00:19:03.960 align:middle line:84%
So I want to share
with you just quickly

00:19:03.960 --> 00:19:09.030 align:middle line:84%
a story that illustrates
the second mirror.

00:19:09.030 --> 00:19:12.000 align:middle line:84%
The early 1990s, three
people came into my life,

00:19:12.000 --> 00:19:13.080 align:middle line:90%
all in the same month.

00:19:13.080 --> 00:19:14.260 align:middle line:84%
And that should
have been my clue.

00:19:14.260 --> 00:19:16.551 align:middle line:84%
It should have been the heads
up that something big was

00:19:16.551 --> 00:19:17.550 align:middle line:90%
about to happen.

00:19:17.550 --> 00:19:20.010 align:middle line:84%
Because almost immediately,
all three of them

00:19:20.010 --> 00:19:22.530 align:middle line:90%
began to make me crazy.

00:19:22.530 --> 00:19:24.900 align:middle line:84%
One of them was a
business relationship,

00:19:24.900 --> 00:19:28.510 align:middle line:84%
one was a friendship, and one
was a romantic relationship.

00:19:28.510 --> 00:19:31.680 align:middle line:90%
And I had a pattern.

00:19:31.680 --> 00:19:34.180 align:middle line:84%
I was traveling a lot
for business at the time.

00:19:34.180 --> 00:19:36.120 align:middle line:10%
And rather than dealing
with these people,

00:19:36.120 --> 00:19:37.703 align:middle line:10%
I would say, you
know, if I could just

00:19:37.703 --> 00:19:40.620 align:middle line:10%
get by another couple of days,
I'm going to go on a trip

00:19:40.620 --> 00:19:43.486 align:middle line:10%
to another event, and then I'll
deal with it when I come back.

00:19:43.486 --> 00:19:44.610 align:middle line:90%
And that's what I would do.

00:19:44.610 --> 00:19:47.100 align:middle line:84%
And I would do this again
and again and again.

00:19:47.100 --> 00:19:50.640 align:middle line:84%
Well, one day, I came
home from an event.

00:19:50.640 --> 00:19:53.830 align:middle line:84%
And what I found was that I came
home to an empty bank account.

00:19:53.830 --> 00:19:58.200 align:middle line:84%
One of the people in my
series of relationships--

00:19:58.200 --> 00:20:00.760 align:middle line:84%
the romantic relationship--
had drained my bank account.

00:20:00.760 --> 00:20:02.070 align:middle line:90%
It was empty.

00:20:02.070 --> 00:20:04.289 align:middle line:10%
And it forced me
to stop everything

00:20:04.289 --> 00:20:06.330 align:middle line:10%
that was happening in my
life, because I couldn't

00:20:06.330 --> 00:20:09.730 align:middle line:10%
do anything else, and come to
terms with what was happening.

00:20:09.730 --> 00:20:12.712 align:middle line:10%
The business relationship-- I
had just been on a long tour.

00:20:12.712 --> 00:20:14.170 align:middle line:10%
The businessman
called me and said,

00:20:14.170 --> 00:20:17.760 align:middle line:10%
the good news is, the tour's
over and everything's paid for.

00:20:17.760 --> 00:20:19.620 align:middle line:84%
The flip side is,
there's no money left

00:20:19.620 --> 00:20:21.280 align:middle line:90%
to give you after the tour.

00:20:21.280 --> 00:20:23.310 align:middle line:90%
We broke even.

00:20:23.310 --> 00:20:25.780 align:middle line:84%
The third part of the
relationship was a friendship.

00:20:25.780 --> 00:20:27.595 align:middle line:84%
Now, this was in
the early 1990s.

00:20:27.595 --> 00:20:29.220 align:middle line:84%
And this is in the
state of New Mexico.

00:20:29.220 --> 00:20:33.920 align:middle line:84%
And I'm saying this
because my friend, who

00:20:33.920 --> 00:20:38.670 align:middle line:84%
was living on my land in
a home that I was loaning

00:20:38.670 --> 00:20:42.090 align:middle line:84%
to my friend, in exchange for
watching my land while I was

00:20:42.090 --> 00:20:44.940 align:middle line:84%
traveling, during the
time I was traveling,

00:20:44.940 --> 00:20:48.720 align:middle line:84%
had chosen to embark
upon growing hash

00:20:48.720 --> 00:20:51.420 align:middle line:84%
crop that was illegal
in the state of New

00:20:51.420 --> 00:20:53.490 align:middle line:90%
Mexico in the 1990s.

00:20:53.490 --> 00:20:55.710 align:middle line:84%
So I think you know
where that's going.

00:20:55.710 --> 00:20:59.760 align:middle line:84%
So each of these people
had done something

00:20:59.760 --> 00:21:02.790 align:middle line:84%
that had violated
my trust, that had

00:21:02.790 --> 00:21:06.330 align:middle line:84%
violated our confidence, that
had betrayed me in some way.

00:21:06.330 --> 00:21:08.610 align:middle line:84%
They did something
that wasn't honest.

00:21:08.610 --> 00:21:11.460 align:middle line:84%
I took a long walk
down a dirt road,

00:21:11.460 --> 00:21:15.160 align:middle line:84%
where I've created entire
books when I walk on this road.

00:21:15.160 --> 00:21:17.640 align:middle line:84%
You don't to worry about
traffic or other people.

00:21:17.640 --> 00:21:20.340 align:middle line:84%
It is a road that
goes on and on and on.

00:21:20.340 --> 00:21:22.590 align:middle line:84%
And while I was
walking on this road,

00:21:22.590 --> 00:21:24.210 align:middle line:90%
I asked myself this question.

00:21:24.210 --> 00:21:27.240 align:middle line:84%
I said, obviously,
something is up for me

00:21:27.240 --> 00:21:29.010 align:middle line:90%
with these relationships.

00:21:29.010 --> 00:21:30.450 align:middle line:84%
What are these
people showing me?

00:21:30.450 --> 00:21:33.000 align:middle line:84%
What is the common theme
that runs through each one

00:21:33.000 --> 00:21:35.010 align:middle line:90%
of these relationships?

00:21:35.010 --> 00:21:36.780 align:middle line:84%
And immediately,
this inner voice

00:21:36.780 --> 00:21:42.400 align:middle line:84%
came up and said,
honesty, trust, integrity.

00:21:42.400 --> 00:21:45.000 align:middle line:84%
Now, in the old way of
thinking about mirrors,

00:21:45.000 --> 00:21:48.480 align:middle line:84%
I would have taken
that to say that there

00:21:48.480 --> 00:21:52.260 align:middle line:84%
was a problem with my honesty,
my trust, my integrity.

00:21:52.260 --> 00:21:53.322 align:middle line:90%
And I asked from within.

00:21:53.322 --> 00:21:54.780 align:middle line:84%
I said, are these
people showing me

00:21:54.780 --> 00:21:56.821 align:middle line:84%
that I'm not honest, that
I don't have integrity,

00:21:56.821 --> 00:21:58.320 align:middle line:90%
that I lack trust?

00:21:58.320 --> 00:22:02.010 align:middle line:84%
And this voice welled up
inside and screamed, no, no.

00:22:02.010 --> 00:22:04.330 align:middle line:84%
That's what your
work is all about.

00:22:04.330 --> 00:22:06.900 align:middle line:84%
It's all about honesty,
trust, and integrity.

00:22:06.900 --> 00:22:12.240 align:middle line:84%
And immediately, that same voice
illuminated the second mirror

00:22:12.240 --> 00:22:14.940 align:middle line:84%
of relationship that I want
to share with you right now.

00:22:14.940 --> 00:22:17.790 align:middle line:84%
These people in
these relationships,

00:22:17.790 --> 00:22:21.510 align:middle line:84%
they were not showing me
what I was in the moment.

00:22:21.510 --> 00:22:25.170 align:middle line:84%
They were not showing me that
I lacked trust and integrity

00:22:25.170 --> 00:22:26.310 align:middle line:90%
and honesty.

00:22:26.310 --> 00:22:29.930 align:middle line:10%
They were showing me what
I judged in the moment.

00:22:29.930 --> 00:22:31.660 align:middle line:90%
And that's the second mirror--

00:22:31.660 --> 00:22:34.010 align:middle line:84%
the second mirror
of what we judge.

00:22:34.010 --> 00:22:35.080 align:middle line:90%
And it was true.

00:22:35.080 --> 00:22:37.690 align:middle line:84%
I had a powerful
charge on honesty,

00:22:37.690 --> 00:22:39.700 align:middle line:90%
on trust, and on integrity.

00:22:39.700 --> 00:22:44.740 align:middle line:84%
And that mirror was so powerful
and the energy was so powerful

00:22:44.740 --> 00:22:46.630 align:middle line:84%
that it was showing up
in three of the most

00:22:46.630 --> 00:22:49.990 align:middle line:84%
significant
relationships of my life.

00:22:49.990 --> 00:22:53.676 align:middle line:84%
This is an example of how
that second mirror shows up.

00:22:53.676 --> 00:22:55.300 align:middle line:84%
And when you think
about your own life,

00:22:55.300 --> 00:22:56.530 align:middle line:90%
look at the people in your life.

00:22:56.530 --> 00:22:57.904 align:middle line:84%
Look at what
they're showing you.

00:22:57.904 --> 00:22:59.510 align:middle line:84%
Ask yourself through
your intuition.

00:22:59.510 --> 00:23:00.310 align:middle line:90%
Close your eyes.

00:23:00.310 --> 00:23:01.480 align:middle line:90%
Go into your heart.

00:23:01.480 --> 00:23:05.380 align:middle line:84%
And say, are the people around
me-- my friends, my lovers,

00:23:05.380 --> 00:23:08.560 align:middle line:84%
my siblings, my
children, my co-workers--

00:23:08.560 --> 00:23:11.920 align:middle line:84%
are they showing me what
I am in the moment, when

00:23:11.920 --> 00:23:14.050 align:middle line:84%
they make me crazy, when
they make me angry, when

00:23:14.050 --> 00:23:15.940 align:middle line:90%
they push all those buttons?

00:23:15.940 --> 00:23:17.670 align:middle line:84%
If the answer is
yes, as I said, you

00:23:17.670 --> 00:23:19.003 align:middle line:90%
know where your workshop begins.

00:23:19.003 --> 00:23:21.970 align:middle line:84%
But if the answer is no,
there's a very good possibility

00:23:21.970 --> 00:23:25.480 align:middle line:84%
that they may be showing you the
second mirror of relationship--

00:23:25.480 --> 00:23:27.880 align:middle line:84%
not what you are in
the moment, rather,

00:23:27.880 --> 00:23:30.450 align:middle line:90%
what you judge in the moment.

00:23:30.450 --> 00:23:33.610 align:middle line:90%
And that's mirror number two.

00:23:33.610 --> 00:23:36.510 align:middle line:84%
I want to share with
you a third mirror.

00:23:36.510 --> 00:23:39.090 align:middle line:84%
And this is one of the most
powerful mirrors for me.

00:23:39.090 --> 00:23:42.000 align:middle line:84%
And I'm going to
begin with a parable

00:23:42.000 --> 00:23:44.310 align:middle line:84%
from Jesus, from
the master, again,

00:23:44.310 --> 00:23:47.230 align:middle line:84%
because it's such a
beautiful parable.

00:23:47.230 --> 00:23:49.770 align:middle line:90%
And what Jesus said is this.

00:23:49.770 --> 00:23:52.890 align:middle line:84%
"The kingdom of my father
is like a certain woman who

00:23:52.890 --> 00:23:56.070 align:middle line:90%
is carrying a jar full of meal.

00:23:56.070 --> 00:24:00.000 align:middle line:84%
While she was walking on a road,
still some distance from home,

00:24:00.000 --> 00:24:03.720 align:middle line:84%
the handle of the jar broke, and
the meal emptied out behind her

00:24:03.720 --> 00:24:05.190 align:middle line:90%
on the road.

00:24:05.190 --> 00:24:07.050 align:middle line:90%
She did not realize it.

00:24:07.050 --> 00:24:09.942 align:middle line:84%
She had not noticed
the incident."

00:24:09.942 --> 00:24:12.450 align:middle line:84%
Now I want you to think
about this parable

00:24:12.450 --> 00:24:15.150 align:middle line:84%
and what it's saying
and what it means to you

00:24:15.150 --> 00:24:17.500 align:middle line:90%
and how it applies in your life.

00:24:17.500 --> 00:24:19.680 align:middle line:84%
Let me share with
you an insight.

00:24:19.680 --> 00:24:24.600 align:middle line:84%
In this parable,
you are the vessel.

00:24:24.600 --> 00:24:30.250 align:middle line:84%
And the meal that's inside
the vessel is your love.

00:24:30.250 --> 00:24:34.350 align:middle line:84%
And as you-- and myself,
because we're in this together--

00:24:34.350 --> 00:24:38.160 align:middle line:84%
go through life, we find
ourselves in situations

00:24:38.160 --> 00:24:43.210 align:middle line:84%
where we give ourselves
away to compromise.

00:24:43.210 --> 00:24:45.510 align:middle line:84%
We give ourselves away
to keep the peace.

00:24:45.510 --> 00:24:48.930 align:middle line:84%
We give ourselves away,
sometimes consciously

00:24:48.930 --> 00:24:50.970 align:middle line:90%
and sometimes unconsciously.

00:24:50.970 --> 00:24:56.340 align:middle line:84%
Little by little by little,
we compromise ourselves.

00:24:56.340 --> 00:24:59.070 align:middle line:84%
And that is like
the meal draining

00:24:59.070 --> 00:25:02.130 align:middle line:84%
from that jar
throughout our lives.

00:25:02.130 --> 00:25:05.820 align:middle line:84%
And then at some point, we find
ourselves in a relationship

00:25:05.820 --> 00:25:08.970 align:middle line:84%
where we truly want to
give ourselves to love.

00:25:08.970 --> 00:25:13.556 align:middle line:84%
And we reach inside the
vessel of us, and it's empty.

00:25:13.556 --> 00:25:15.180 align:middle line:84%
Because we've given
all that love away.

00:25:15.180 --> 00:25:17.310 align:middle line:90%
We've compromised that love.

00:25:17.310 --> 00:25:19.780 align:middle line:84%
That's what this
mirror is all about.

00:25:19.780 --> 00:25:21.420 align:middle line:90%
It is a powerful mirror.

00:25:21.420 --> 00:25:25.150 align:middle line:84%
Let me share with
you how it works.

00:25:25.150 --> 00:25:28.770 align:middle line:84%
If you've ever felt a
really powerful attraction

00:25:28.770 --> 00:25:32.520 align:middle line:84%
to another person for reasons
that you could not explain--

00:25:32.520 --> 00:25:34.920 align:middle line:84%
you might be in a perfectly
happy relationship.

00:25:34.920 --> 00:25:36.660 align:middle line:84%
Maybe you're in a
committed relationship.

00:25:36.660 --> 00:25:38.430 align:middle line:90%
Maybe you're married.

00:25:38.430 --> 00:25:41.190 align:middle line:84%
And a friend or a co-worker
or someone in a grocery

00:25:41.190 --> 00:25:44.160 align:middle line:84%
store-- all of a sudden, you
find yourself powerfully,

00:25:44.160 --> 00:25:47.680 align:middle line:84%
magnetically attracted
to this other person.

00:25:47.680 --> 00:25:49.620 align:middle line:84%
This is how this
mirror plays out.

00:25:49.620 --> 00:25:52.680 align:middle line:84%
Now, often, we never get
to understand the mirror,

00:25:52.680 --> 00:25:56.200 align:middle line:84%
because our culture says it's
wrong to have those feelings.

00:25:56.200 --> 00:25:58.860 align:middle line:84%
So we spend our time
denying and hiding

00:25:58.860 --> 00:26:00.930 align:middle line:90%
and discounting the feelings.

00:26:00.930 --> 00:26:02.671 align:middle line:84%
Let me invite you
to try something.

00:26:02.671 --> 00:26:04.170 align:middle line:84%
Next time this
happens-- and it will

00:26:04.170 --> 00:26:05.970 align:middle line:84%
happen, because it
happens to all of us,

00:26:05.970 --> 00:26:07.830 align:middle line:90%
if we're honest about it.

00:26:07.830 --> 00:26:10.260 align:middle line:84%
Next time you find
yourself powerfully

00:26:10.260 --> 00:26:12.450 align:middle line:84%
drawn to another
person for reasons

00:26:12.450 --> 00:26:17.200 align:middle line:84%
that you may not understand,
ask yourself subconsciously

00:26:17.200 --> 00:26:18.000 align:middle line:90%
this question.

00:26:18.000 --> 00:26:20.080 align:middle line:84%
I'm not saying to
do it out loud.

00:26:20.080 --> 00:26:22.410 align:middle line:84%
But if you find yourself
powerfully drawn to a person,

00:26:22.410 --> 00:26:24.600 align:middle line:84%
engage them in conversation
about anything.

00:26:24.600 --> 00:26:25.620 align:middle line:90%
How's the weather?

00:26:25.620 --> 00:26:26.600 align:middle line:90%
How's your day?

00:26:26.600 --> 00:26:27.400 align:middle line:90%
How's the family?

00:26:27.400 --> 00:26:28.600 align:middle line:90%
Whatever it is.

00:26:28.600 --> 00:26:32.760 align:middle line:84%
While you're talking to them,
ask this question silently

00:26:32.760 --> 00:26:34.680 align:middle line:90%
inside of yourself.

00:26:34.680 --> 00:26:38.200 align:middle line:10%
What is it that I
see in this person

00:26:38.200 --> 00:26:40.900 align:middle line:10%
or that I sense in
this person that I've

00:26:40.900 --> 00:26:45.670 align:middle line:10%
lost, given away, or had
taken from me by those

00:26:45.670 --> 00:26:47.500 align:middle line:10%
who had power over me?

00:26:47.500 --> 00:26:50.200 align:middle line:84%
And you'll be amazed
at what comes to you.

00:26:50.200 --> 00:26:54.970 align:middle line:84%
You'll be amazed at the inner
voice, the inner insights that

00:26:54.970 --> 00:26:59.110 align:middle line:84%
come back and say to you, there
is a quality about the person

00:26:59.110 --> 00:27:02.860 align:middle line:84%
that you're magnetically
drawn to that you aspire to.

00:27:02.860 --> 00:27:04.900 align:middle line:84%
This is what the
attraction is all about.

00:27:04.900 --> 00:27:08.770 align:middle line:84%
And we feel this powerful
magnetic attraction.

00:27:08.770 --> 00:27:10.780 align:middle line:90%
The master is telling us why.

00:27:10.780 --> 00:27:15.070 align:middle line:84%
As we compromise, as we give
away pieces of ourselves,

00:27:15.070 --> 00:27:17.920 align:middle line:84%
some of us have
those pieces taken

00:27:17.920 --> 00:27:20.800 align:middle line:84%
by those who have power
over us when we're young.

00:27:20.800 --> 00:27:23.350 align:middle line:84%
And the pattern continues
throughout our lives.

00:27:23.350 --> 00:27:30.160 align:middle line:84%
As those things happen, you
and I will search the world.

00:27:30.160 --> 00:27:33.020 align:middle line:90%
Because we long to be complete.

00:27:33.020 --> 00:27:35.560 align:middle line:84%
We long for the
wholeness that can only

00:27:35.560 --> 00:27:38.950 align:middle line:84%
come from finding
those pieces again.

00:27:38.950 --> 00:27:42.190 align:middle line:84%
And when we find ourselves in
the presence of someone who

00:27:42.190 --> 00:27:46.370 align:middle line:84%
has what it is that we've lost,
given away, or had taken away,

00:27:46.370 --> 00:27:48.520 align:middle line:84%
and we say, I feel really
good around this person,

00:27:48.520 --> 00:27:50.890 align:middle line:90%
I feel whole, I feel complete--

00:27:50.890 --> 00:27:54.010 align:middle line:84%
couples often say, it's my
other half, my better half.

00:27:54.010 --> 00:27:56.216 align:middle line:90%
I'm complete with this person.

00:27:56.216 --> 00:27:58.090 align:middle line:84%
And we laugh when we
hear that as a metaphor.

00:27:58.090 --> 00:28:01.120 align:middle line:84%
But they may be actually
telling you the deepest

00:28:01.120 --> 00:28:03.640 align:middle line:90%
truth of their deepest secret--

00:28:03.640 --> 00:28:06.640 align:middle line:84%
that they are now in the
presence of someone that

00:28:06.640 --> 00:28:11.980 align:middle line:84%
fills in the gaps, that
completes the places

00:28:11.980 --> 00:28:13.630 align:middle line:90%
that they've lost or given away.

00:28:13.630 --> 00:28:17.320 align:middle line:84%
And we will continue
in these relationships,

00:28:17.320 --> 00:28:20.170 align:middle line:84%
and allow those people
to reflect back to us

00:28:20.170 --> 00:28:24.010 align:middle line:84%
what it is that we long to have,
until, subconsciously or maybe

00:28:24.010 --> 00:28:29.170 align:middle line:84%
consciously, we remember and we
reclaim that part of ourselves.

00:28:29.170 --> 00:28:31.090 align:middle line:84%
And this is where it
gets really interesting.

00:28:31.090 --> 00:28:34.210 align:middle line:84%
Because when we
reclaim those parts,

00:28:34.210 --> 00:28:36.474 align:middle line:84%
we no longer feel
the attraction.

00:28:36.474 --> 00:28:38.140 align:middle line:84%
And if we don't know
what just happened,

00:28:38.140 --> 00:28:40.750 align:middle line:84%
we say, oh, well, I'm
not in love anymore.

00:28:40.750 --> 00:28:43.630 align:middle line:84%
When the truth is that you
may be in a relationship

00:28:43.630 --> 00:28:46.780 align:middle line:84%
where the love is so deep, that
you are now more complete, more

00:28:46.780 --> 00:28:50.560 align:middle line:84%
whole, and healthier than you
have been for a very long time.

00:28:50.560 --> 00:28:52.090 align:middle line:84%
And then the question
becomes, do I

00:28:52.090 --> 00:28:55.660 align:middle line:84%
continue this relationship
because of that love?

00:28:55.660 --> 00:28:57.670 align:middle line:84%
How deep can we go
and how far can we

00:28:57.670 --> 00:28:59.380 align:middle line:90%
go in this new way of being?

00:28:59.380 --> 00:29:01.990 align:middle line:84%
Or do you find
yourself in a place

00:29:01.990 --> 00:29:03.460 align:middle line:90%
where you say, you know what?

00:29:03.460 --> 00:29:06.190 align:middle line:84%
I want to find another
piece of myself.

00:29:06.190 --> 00:29:09.610 align:middle line:84%
So you find another
person where you feel

00:29:09.610 --> 00:29:12.750 align:middle line:90%
that deep, powerful attraction.

00:29:12.750 --> 00:29:14.890 align:middle line:84%
So we're just barely
scratching the surface.

00:29:14.890 --> 00:29:19.290 align:middle line:84%
But I want to give you the
insights of how powerful

00:29:19.290 --> 00:29:22.575 align:middle line:90%
these mirrors are in our lives.

00:29:22.575 --> 00:29:24.950 align:middle line:84%
And once again, I'm going to
bring this back to the theme

00:29:24.950 --> 00:29:26.760 align:middle line:90%
of this entire series.

00:29:26.760 --> 00:29:30.680 align:middle line:84%
These mirrors are playing
out through the stuff

00:29:30.680 --> 00:29:35.810 align:middle line:84%
that fills the empty space
of the field of this matrix,

00:29:35.810 --> 00:29:38.180 align:middle line:84%
of the Higgs field,
of the divine matrix,

00:29:38.180 --> 00:29:40.280 align:middle line:84%
or whatever it is
we want to call it.

00:29:40.280 --> 00:29:43.280 align:middle line:84%
Because what's happening between
you and that other person

00:29:43.280 --> 00:29:48.060 align:middle line:84%
has to be happening through
the conduit of this field.

00:29:48.060 --> 00:29:50.470 align:middle line:84%
Mirror number three is
the mirror of the things

00:29:50.470 --> 00:29:52.930 align:middle line:84%
that we've lost, given
away, or had taken away

00:29:52.930 --> 00:29:55.950 align:middle line:90%
within ourselves.

00:29:55.950 --> 00:29:58.840 align:middle line:84%
And while the mirrors of
our reflected reality are

00:29:58.840 --> 00:30:02.890 align:middle line:84%
fascinating-- they're giving us
deeper insights into our very

00:30:02.890 --> 00:30:04.120 align:middle line:90%
existence--

00:30:04.120 --> 00:30:06.970 align:middle line:84%
even those mirrors
are playing out

00:30:06.970 --> 00:30:10.500 align:middle line:84%
from inside of an
even deeper mystery.

00:30:10.500 --> 00:30:13.450 align:middle line:84%
They're happening within
the Divine Matrix.

00:30:13.450 --> 00:30:16.090 align:middle line:84%
And they're part
of a mystery that

00:30:16.090 --> 00:30:20.360 align:middle line:84%
has haunted scientists
for over 300 years.

00:30:20.360 --> 00:30:24.550 align:middle line:84%
The mystery I'm talking about
is the mystery of time itself.

00:30:24.550 --> 00:30:28.420 align:middle line:84%
After 300 years of theories
and equations and experiments,

00:30:28.420 --> 00:30:30.830 align:middle line:84%
we still don't know
precisely what it is

00:30:30.830 --> 00:30:33.330 align:middle line:84%
and exactly how it
fits into our lives.

00:30:33.330 --> 00:30:36.430 align:middle line:84%
Well, in the next episode,
I'll share the mind boggling

00:30:36.430 --> 00:30:38.380 align:middle line:84%
discovery that's
forever changed the way

00:30:38.380 --> 00:30:41.060 align:middle line:90%
we think of time in our lives.

00:30:41.060 --> 00:30:43.570 align:middle line:84%
I want to thank you for
joining me for today's program.

00:30:43.570 --> 00:30:45.520 align:middle line:84%
And be sure to tune
in for our next

00:30:45.520 --> 00:30:48.070 align:middle line:84%

Bridging Time, Space,
Miracles, and Belief.

00:30:52.440 --> 00:31:03.638 align:middle line:90%
