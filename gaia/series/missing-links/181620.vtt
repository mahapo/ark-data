>>GREGG BRADEN: Hello.

00:00:25.110 --> 00:00:26.220 align:middle line:90%
My name's Gregg Braden.

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:28.800 align:middle line:10%
And I'd like to welcome you
to this all-new presentation

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:30.720 align:middle line:10%
of "The Divine Matrix--

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:34.250 align:middle line:10%
Bridging Time, Space,
Miracles, and Belief."

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:38.640 align:middle line:84%
For 3,000 years, sages,
mystics, and prophets

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:41.160 align:middle line:84%
have revered a single,
mysterious document

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:44.550 align:middle line:84%
as the manual that holds the
consequences and the outcome

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:46.830 align:middle line:84%
for every possible
choice that we could ever

00:00:46.830 --> 00:00:48.720 align:middle line:90%
make in our lives.

00:00:48.720 --> 00:00:51.460 align:middle line:84%
In this episode, we'll
marry the best science

00:00:51.460 --> 00:00:54.150 align:middle line:84%
of the modern world with
the secret of this manual

00:00:54.150 --> 00:00:57.870 align:middle line:84%
to reveal the unthinkable,
a time map that

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:00.930 align:middle line:84%
holds the details of every
major event that has occurred

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:04.800 align:middle line:84%
in the last 3,000 years, as
well as the consequences that

00:01:04.800 --> 00:01:06.270 align:middle line:90%
are yet to come.

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:09.060 align:middle line:10%
The assassination of Israeli
prime minister Yitzhak Rabin

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:13.100 align:middle line:10%
is a perfect example
of what I mean here.

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:15.560 align:middle line:84%
Israeli Prime
Minister Yitzhak Rabin

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:17.630 align:middle line:84%
was assassinated
by a lone gunman

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:21.720 align:middle line:84%
during a public appearance
on November 5, 1995.

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:24.600 align:middle line:84%
The motive for his
killing is believed

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:28.950 align:middle line:84%
to have been his willingness
to compromise so many policies

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:30.900 align:middle line:84%
in an effort to bring
a long-awaited peace

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:32.430 align:middle line:90%
to the Middle East.

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:35.560 align:middle line:84%
Well, the date of his
assassination, the time,

00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:38.250 align:middle line:84%
the location, and even
the name of the man

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:42.570 align:middle line:84%
that assassinated him were
discovered in an ancient code,

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:44.820 align:middle line:84%
in a book that was
written over 3,000 years

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:47.260 align:middle line:84%
before the assassination
ever happened.

00:01:47.260 --> 00:01:50.640 align:middle line:10%
Now interestingly, Rabin
was warned that his death

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:53.190 align:middle line:10%
was coded into this document.

00:01:53.190 --> 00:01:55.270 align:middle line:84%
And when he discovered
the source of the code,

00:01:55.270 --> 00:01:57.990 align:middle line:84%
he chose to go forward
in spite of the warning

00:01:57.990 --> 00:01:59.730 align:middle line:90%
with a public appearance.

00:01:59.730 --> 00:02:02.520 align:middle line:10%
The details of
Rabin's assassination

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:06.600 align:middle line:10%
are part of a mystery that
is known as the Torah code,

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:09.430 align:middle line:10%
or more commonly,
the Bible code.

00:02:09.430 --> 00:02:12.180 align:middle line:10%
And when we ask the question,
what is the Bible code,

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:14.010 align:middle line:10%
I know many people
have heard about it.

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:15.990 align:middle line:10%
Many people have heard
that it is a hoax.

00:02:15.990 --> 00:02:19.740 align:middle line:84%
There have been YouTube
videos and research projects

00:02:19.740 --> 00:02:23.490 align:middle line:84%
that tried to discount
this code that we find

00:02:23.490 --> 00:02:26.161 align:middle line:90%
within this singular document.

00:02:26.161 --> 00:02:27.660 align:middle line:84%
So I want to be
very clear with you.

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:29.020 align:middle line:90%
I've done my own research.

00:02:29.020 --> 00:02:30.780 align:middle line:84%
And I would not be
sharing this with you

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:33.270 align:middle line:84%
if I did not believe from
my own personal research

00:02:33.270 --> 00:02:35.160 align:middle line:84%
that everything I'm
going to share with you

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:37.740 align:middle line:90%
is absolutely accurate.

00:02:37.740 --> 00:02:39.840 align:middle line:84%
I'm not saying
that we understand

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:42.600 align:middle line:84%
100% this mystery,
how it has occurred,

00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:43.674 align:middle line:90%
or where it comes from.

00:02:43.674 --> 00:02:45.090 align:middle line:84%
But I want to say
to you that what

00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:47.230 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to share
with you is not a hoax.

00:02:47.230 --> 00:02:50.290 align:middle line:84%
And I think when you see the
evidence, you'll agree with me.

00:02:50.290 --> 00:02:52.770 align:middle line:84%
So when we ask, what
is the Bible code,

00:02:52.770 --> 00:02:55.050 align:middle line:84%
a really deceptively
simple answer

00:02:55.050 --> 00:02:57.810 align:middle line:84%
was offered by the
18th-century scholar that was

00:02:57.810 --> 00:03:00.270 align:middle line:90%
known as the Genius of Vilna.

00:03:00.270 --> 00:03:03.060 align:middle line:84%
In his own words, here's
what that scholar said.

00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:04.440 align:middle line:90%
And this is a quote.

00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:09.570 align:middle line:84%
He said, "The rule is, that
all that was, all that is,

00:03:09.570 --> 00:03:12.540 align:middle line:84%
and all that will be
until the end of time

00:03:12.540 --> 00:03:16.250 align:middle line:84%
is included in the Torah from
the first word to the last."

00:03:16.250 --> 00:03:18.180 align:middle line:90%
And that's the end of the quote.

00:03:18.180 --> 00:03:20.550 align:middle line:84%
Well, in my experience,
my research,

00:03:20.550 --> 00:03:22.800 align:middle line:84%
I want to tell you that
every query that has ever

00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:25.470 align:middle line:84%
been made into the
mystery of this code

00:03:25.470 --> 00:03:28.650 align:middle line:84%
has produced results that are
statistically significant.

00:03:28.650 --> 00:03:29.650 align:middle line:90%
They're not random.

00:03:29.650 --> 00:03:30.870 align:middle line:90%
They're not accidental.

00:03:30.870 --> 00:03:34.710 align:middle line:84%
And this even goes to the name
of every human who has ever

00:03:34.710 --> 00:03:35.940 align:middle line:90%
been entered into this code.

00:03:35.940 --> 00:03:39.000 align:middle line:84%
Your name is in the
Torah code, my name

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:42.060 align:middle line:84%
is in the Torah code,
the details of your life,

00:03:42.060 --> 00:03:43.990 align:middle line:90%
the details of my life.

00:03:43.990 --> 00:03:45.450 align:middle line:84%
And when you say,
how can that be,

00:03:45.450 --> 00:03:48.120 align:middle line:84%
that's why I wanted to
share this episode with you.

00:03:48.120 --> 00:03:51.210 align:middle line:84%
Because the Torah
code is believed now

00:03:51.210 --> 00:03:55.260 align:middle line:84%
to be a manual for the
quantum possibilities

00:03:55.260 --> 00:03:58.560 align:middle line:84%
that are available
within the Divine Matrix.

00:03:58.560 --> 00:04:01.500 align:middle line:84%
So we're coming
back to this idea

00:04:01.500 --> 00:04:03.570 align:middle line:84%
that we're living
within this field.

00:04:03.570 --> 00:04:06.210 align:middle line:84%
And within this field,
events are unfolding.

00:04:06.210 --> 00:04:07.590 align:middle line:90%
They are following patterns.

00:04:07.590 --> 00:04:09.360 align:middle line:90%
They are following cycles.

00:04:09.360 --> 00:04:11.370 align:middle line:84%
And now it's possible
that we actually

00:04:11.370 --> 00:04:13.530 align:middle line:84%
have a manual that
helps us to understand

00:04:13.530 --> 00:04:16.170 align:middle line:84%
how to interpret those
cycles, the consequences

00:04:16.170 --> 00:04:17.519 align:middle line:90%
of our choices.

00:04:17.519 --> 00:04:19.529 align:middle line:84%
That's what I want to
show you right now.

00:04:19.529 --> 00:04:22.280 align:middle line:10%
One year before
Rabin's assassination,

00:04:22.280 --> 00:04:26.310 align:middle line:10%
a scientific paper was
released-- the year 1994--

00:04:26.310 --> 00:04:28.050 align:middle line:10%
in the journal
"Statistical Science."

00:04:28.050 --> 00:04:31.650 align:middle line:10%
And it described this Bible
code for the first time

00:04:31.650 --> 00:04:34.080 align:middle line:10%
in scientific terms.

00:04:34.080 --> 00:04:36.690 align:middle line:84%
Now the paper was written
by two mathematicians,

00:04:36.690 --> 00:04:41.070 align:middle line:84%
Eliyahu Rips was the primary
author, and Doron Witztum.

00:04:41.070 --> 00:04:44.460 align:middle line:90%
The title is very interesting.

00:04:44.460 --> 00:04:47.190 align:middle line:84%
And it's one of the reasons
that I think the paper was not

00:04:47.190 --> 00:04:49.740 align:middle line:84%
widely accepted
in common circles,

00:04:49.740 --> 00:04:52.680 align:middle line:84%
because the title makes
it sound very complex.

00:04:52.680 --> 00:04:56.760 align:middle line:10%
The title was called,
"Equidistant Letter Sequences

00:04:56.760 --> 00:04:58.500 align:middle line:10%
in the Book of Genesis."

00:04:58.500 --> 00:05:02.640 align:middle line:10%
And this paper described
the first experiment using

00:05:02.640 --> 00:05:05.680 align:middle line:10%
computers to detect the code.

00:05:05.680 --> 00:05:08.550 align:middle line:84%
So let me just share with
you why that's important.

00:05:08.550 --> 00:05:12.300 align:middle line:84%
Because for at
least 1,000 years,

00:05:12.300 --> 00:05:14.790 align:middle line:84%
Torah scholars,
biblical scholars,

00:05:14.790 --> 00:05:19.920 align:middle line:84%
have suspected that there were
hidden codes within the Torah.

00:05:19.920 --> 00:05:22.260 align:middle line:84%
And I'm going to talk about
precisely what the Torah is

00:05:22.260 --> 00:05:23.520 align:middle line:90%
in just a moment.

00:05:23.520 --> 00:05:27.180 align:middle line:84%
But these scholars suspected
that this code was there.

00:05:27.180 --> 00:05:30.090 align:middle line:84%
They didn't have
computers 1,000 years ago.

00:05:30.090 --> 00:05:33.570 align:middle line:84%
So to find these codes, they
were doing everything by hand.

00:05:33.570 --> 00:05:37.200 align:middle line:84%
They were manually looking
for these relationships.

00:05:37.200 --> 00:05:39.630 align:middle line:84%
And it's said that some of
them actually went crazy.

00:05:39.630 --> 00:05:43.440 align:middle line:84%
They actually went insane
with the complexity of what

00:05:43.440 --> 00:05:45.045 align:middle line:90%
it was they were trying to do.

00:05:45.045 --> 00:05:47.440 align:middle line:90%
Well, it was only in 1994.

00:05:47.440 --> 00:05:49.680 align:middle line:10%
And you think back in
time, the computers

00:05:49.680 --> 00:05:51.714 align:middle line:10%
that we take for
granted today, they

00:05:51.714 --> 00:05:52.880 align:middle line:10%
haven't been around forever.

00:05:52.880 --> 00:05:57.510 align:middle line:84%
And in 1994, some of the kinds
of software we deal with today

00:05:57.510 --> 00:05:59.290 align:middle line:90%
were just in their infancy.

00:05:59.290 --> 00:06:03.270 align:middle line:84%
Now having worked in the
industry developing code

00:06:03.270 --> 00:06:06.810 align:middle line:84%
to look for patterns, I can
attest to this firsthand.

00:06:06.810 --> 00:06:11.340 align:middle line:84%
When I was in the industry
in the 1980s, 1990s,

00:06:11.340 --> 00:06:14.700 align:middle line:84%
pattern recognition software
is what we were developing.

00:06:14.700 --> 00:06:17.290 align:middle line:84%
And that pattern
recognition software

00:06:17.290 --> 00:06:20.640 align:middle line:84%
was running on computers that
are very, very different.

00:06:20.640 --> 00:06:23.530 align:middle line:84%
We didn't have our
Macintosh laptops

00:06:23.530 --> 00:06:24.930 align:middle line:90%
that so many people use today.

00:06:24.930 --> 00:06:28.870 align:middle line:84%
And we didn't have the
IBM laptops and the very

00:06:28.870 --> 00:06:32.980 align:middle line:84%
compact models running at
tremendously high speeds

00:06:32.980 --> 00:06:34.700 align:middle line:84%
with so much storage
that we see today.

00:06:34.700 --> 00:06:37.420 align:middle line:84%
So I'm going to invite
you to keep this in mind

00:06:37.420 --> 00:06:41.810 align:middle line:84%
as I describe what was
happening in the 1994 study.

00:06:41.810 --> 00:06:44.650 align:middle line:84%
So in 1994, the
paper was released.

00:06:44.650 --> 00:06:48.280 align:middle line:84%
The purpose of the paper was
to describe an experiment that

00:06:48.280 --> 00:06:49.510 align:middle line:90%
had been run.

00:06:49.510 --> 00:06:51.460 align:middle line:84%
And the experiment
was to determine

00:06:51.460 --> 00:06:56.530 align:middle line:84%
if the names of 32
very famous rabbis

00:06:56.530 --> 00:07:00.596 align:middle line:84%
could be identified using
algorithms in the Bible code.

00:07:00.596 --> 00:07:03.627 align:middle line:84%
Well, without going into all the
technical details right here,

00:07:03.627 --> 00:07:05.960 align:middle line:84%
I'm just going to tell you,
the results were astounding.

00:07:05.960 --> 00:07:07.870 align:middle line:10%
They were more than successful.

00:07:07.870 --> 00:07:09.850 align:middle line:10%
They exceeded all
the expectations.

00:07:09.850 --> 00:07:12.760 align:middle line:10%
Not only were the names
of those 32 scholars

00:07:12.760 --> 00:07:15.670 align:middle line:10%
there, but there was
additional information

00:07:15.670 --> 00:07:19.000 align:middle line:10%
that was not even queried that
was coming up with their names.

00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:21.340 align:middle line:84%
Well, this is where it gets
really, really interesting.

00:07:21.340 --> 00:07:26.660 align:middle line:84%
Because that idea, that theory,
was retested a few years later,

00:07:26.660 --> 00:07:28.270 align:middle line:90%
1997.

00:07:28.270 --> 00:07:30.790 align:middle line:10%
During an unprecedented
experiment--

00:07:30.790 --> 00:07:34.090 align:middle line:10%
it lasted 440 hours--

00:07:34.090 --> 00:07:36.790 align:middle line:10%
the computers were running
the search algorithms

00:07:36.790 --> 00:07:39.550 align:middle line:10%
for 440 hours.

00:07:39.550 --> 00:07:42.550 align:middle line:10%
And this time, rather
than the mathematicians

00:07:42.550 --> 00:07:44.620 align:middle line:10%
that had developed
the algorithms doing

00:07:44.620 --> 00:07:46.870 align:middle line:10%
the work, this
time, the experiment

00:07:46.870 --> 00:07:50.830 align:middle line:10%
was run by a former senior
cryptologic mathematician

00:07:50.830 --> 00:07:53.350 align:middle line:10%
for the NSA of
the United States.

00:07:53.350 --> 00:07:55.540 align:middle line:90%
His name was Harold Gans.

00:07:55.540 --> 00:08:00.230 align:middle line:84%
Harold Gans took the original
experiment one step further.

00:08:00.230 --> 00:08:04.990 align:middle line:84%
And he began with the
names of 66 famous rabbis.

00:08:04.990 --> 00:08:07.660 align:middle line:10%
He tested those names
against themselves.

00:08:07.660 --> 00:08:10.300 align:middle line:84%
But he wanted to
see if the dates

00:08:10.300 --> 00:08:13.390 align:middle line:84%
and the places of the birth
and the death for each rabbi

00:08:13.390 --> 00:08:15.010 align:middle line:90%
would also show up.

00:08:15.010 --> 00:08:17.710 align:middle line:84%
Well, once again, at the
end of this experiment,

00:08:17.710 --> 00:08:19.900 align:middle line:84%
the information that was
revealed by the codes

00:08:19.900 --> 00:08:23.140 align:middle line:84%
exceeded even Harold
Gans' expectations.

00:08:23.140 --> 00:08:26.890 align:middle line:84%
Not only did the names come up,
the exact dates of the birth,

00:08:26.890 --> 00:08:29.770 align:middle line:84%
the exact dates of the
death, and even the cities

00:08:29.770 --> 00:08:33.730 align:middle line:84%
where they were born and the
cities where the rabbis died--

00:08:33.730 --> 00:08:37.280 align:middle line:84%
even if they were different--
they showed up in this study.

00:08:37.280 --> 00:08:38.980 align:middle line:90%
Well, Harold Gans wrote a paper.

00:08:38.980 --> 00:08:42.070 align:middle line:84%
In his conclusion,
he stated that this

00:08:42.070 --> 00:08:45.030 align:middle line:84%
is statistically more
than significant,

00:08:45.030 --> 00:08:46.090 align:middle line:90%
that this is no accident.

00:08:46.090 --> 00:08:51.250 align:middle line:84%
There is a code that is
encoded within the Torah,

00:08:51.250 --> 00:08:54.220 align:middle line:84%
within the first five
books of the Hebrew Bible.

00:08:54.220 --> 00:08:57.650 align:middle line:84%
And it's encoded in a way
that exists nowhere else.

00:08:57.650 --> 00:09:00.460 align:middle line:84%
Well, since the time
of these experiments,

00:09:00.460 --> 00:09:03.130 align:middle line:84%
once the researchers
discovered how accurate

00:09:03.130 --> 00:09:04.870 align:middle line:84%
these codes were,
all of a sudden,

00:09:04.870 --> 00:09:06.190 align:middle line:90%
they began to query everything.

00:09:06.190 --> 00:09:10.900 align:middle line:84%
And everything that has ever
been queried in the code

00:09:10.900 --> 00:09:12.310 align:middle line:90%
has revealed specifics.

00:09:12.310 --> 00:09:14.530 align:middle line:90%
Just for example, World War II--

00:09:14.530 --> 00:09:19.170 align:middle line:84%
when World War II was
queried in the Torah code,

00:09:19.170 --> 00:09:22.300 align:middle line:84%
it actually spells out
the words "World War II."

00:09:22.300 --> 00:09:24.850 align:middle line:84%
It spells out the
words "final solution."

00:09:24.850 --> 00:09:26.830 align:middle line:84%
The code gives the
name of the leaders

00:09:26.830 --> 00:09:28.120 align:middle line:90%
who are present at the time--

00:09:28.120 --> 00:09:30.850 align:middle line:84%
Roosevelt, Stalin,
Hitler, Churchill.

00:09:30.850 --> 00:09:33.850 align:middle line:84%
It gives the exact names of the
countries that were involved--

00:09:33.850 --> 00:09:35.890 align:middle line:84%
England, Germany,
France, Russia, Japan,

00:09:35.890 --> 00:09:36.770 align:middle line:90%
the United States.

00:09:36.770 --> 00:09:42.500 align:middle line:84%
It even gives the words "atomic
Holocaust" and the year 1945.

00:09:42.500 --> 00:09:46.150 align:middle line:84%
Now one of the questions that
people have asked me when I do

00:09:46.150 --> 00:09:51.430 align:middle line:84%
lectures on this topic is, could
this information be random?

00:09:51.430 --> 00:09:53.960 align:middle line:84%
Could it be encoded
in other documents?

00:09:53.960 --> 00:09:56.260 align:middle line:84%
And what I want to
say to you, to date,

00:09:56.260 --> 00:09:59.200 align:middle line:84%
other texts have been
tested, including

00:09:59.200 --> 00:10:02.380 align:middle line:84%
"Webster's Dictionary,"
including novels, huge novels,

00:10:02.380 --> 00:10:06.990 align:middle line:84%
like the book "War and
Peace," the book "Moby Dick."

00:10:06.990 --> 00:10:09.630 align:middle line:84%
And in all of these
other texts, the codes

00:10:09.630 --> 00:10:12.300 align:middle line:84%
do not work the way
they do in the Torah.

00:10:12.300 --> 00:10:16.500 align:middle line:84%
There is something about the
way the Torah is put together,

00:10:16.500 --> 00:10:19.860 align:middle line:84%
something about the way
that it is arranged.

00:10:19.860 --> 00:10:21.600 align:middle line:84%
And that something
is the mystery

00:10:21.600 --> 00:10:23.730 align:middle line:84%
that we're going to
explore right now.

00:10:23.730 --> 00:10:26.850 align:middle line:84%
The precise results are only
possible with the Torah.

00:10:26.850 --> 00:10:30.030 align:middle line:84%
And in mathematics--
this is so interesting

00:10:30.030 --> 00:10:33.900 align:middle line:84%
to me-- the most stringent
standard for a statistical odd

00:10:33.900 --> 00:10:36.510 align:middle line:84%
to be significant is one
in 1,000 in mathematics,

00:10:36.510 --> 00:10:37.650 align:middle line:90%
typically.

00:10:37.650 --> 00:10:40.920 align:middle line:84%
The Torah code odds, the odds
of these things showing up

00:10:40.920 --> 00:10:45.450 align:middle line:84%
in the Torah the way they
do, are one in 100,000.

00:10:45.450 --> 00:10:48.360 align:middle line:84%
So we can see, statistically,
there's something happening

00:10:48.360 --> 00:10:51.862 align:middle line:84%
here that cannot be explained
by conventional thinking,

00:10:51.862 --> 00:10:53.820 align:middle line:84%
conventional physics,
conventional mathematics,

00:10:53.820 --> 00:10:56.390 align:middle line:90%
at least as we know it today.

00:10:56.390 --> 00:10:59.210 align:middle line:84%
The information
coded into the Torah

00:10:59.210 --> 00:11:03.170 align:middle line:84%
appears to follow the rule
of mathematician Heisenberg.

00:11:03.170 --> 00:11:06.650 align:middle line:84%
And he created something
called Heisenberg's uncertainty

00:11:06.650 --> 00:11:07.790 align:middle line:90%
principle.

00:11:07.790 --> 00:11:10.160 align:middle line:84%
And that principle is
summarized by Stephen Hawking.

00:11:10.160 --> 00:11:12.770 align:middle line:84%
And I want to share
with you, in a very

00:11:12.770 --> 00:11:16.400 align:middle line:84%
single, specific sentence,
what Hawking said.

00:11:16.400 --> 00:11:19.370 align:middle line:84%
Hawking said, and this is
a quote, "Quantum mechanics

00:11:19.370 --> 00:11:22.490 align:middle line:84%
does not predict a
single definite result

00:11:22.490 --> 00:11:24.200 align:middle line:90%
for an observation.

00:11:24.200 --> 00:11:29.360 align:middle line:84%
Instead, it predicts a number
of different possible outcomes

00:11:29.360 --> 00:11:33.050 align:middle line:84%
and then tells us how likely
each of these outcomes is,"

00:11:33.050 --> 00:11:34.430 align:middle line:90%
end of quote.

00:11:34.430 --> 00:11:38.190 align:middle line:84%
This appears to be the way
that the Bible code works.

00:11:38.190 --> 00:11:43.130 align:middle line:84%
It does not predict what will
happen when we query the Bible

00:11:43.130 --> 00:11:45.890 align:middle line:90%
code in a very specific manner.

00:11:45.890 --> 00:11:49.730 align:middle line:84%
It gives us the consequences
that are likely,

00:11:49.730 --> 00:11:52.060 align:middle line:84%
the consequences
that are possible.

00:11:52.060 --> 00:11:56.510 align:middle line:84%
And in this way, it is suspected
that this is a quantum code.

00:11:56.510 --> 00:11:59.840 align:middle line:84%
So I'm going to give you
some specific examples of how

00:11:59.840 --> 00:12:00.857 align:middle line:90%
this works.

00:12:00.857 --> 00:12:02.690 align:middle line:84%
But I want to begin
with the very beginning.

00:12:02.690 --> 00:12:05.148 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to go back to the
beginning of this conversation.

00:12:05.148 --> 00:12:07.070 align:middle line:84%
And I want to talk to
you about the Torah.

00:12:07.070 --> 00:12:08.690 align:middle line:90%
Just what is the Torah?

00:12:08.690 --> 00:12:11.490 align:middle line:84%
Why does it work the
way that it works?

00:12:11.490 --> 00:12:13.730 align:middle line:84%
Well, as I mentioned
earlier, the Torah

00:12:13.730 --> 00:12:18.020 align:middle line:84%
represents the first five
books of the Hebrew Bible--

00:12:18.020 --> 00:12:21.830 align:middle line:84%
Genesis, Exodus, Leviticus,
Numbers and Deuteronomy--

00:12:21.830 --> 00:12:24.500 align:middle line:84%
that happen to be the first
five books of the Old Testament

00:12:24.500 --> 00:12:27.290 align:middle line:90%
in the Christian Bible as well.

00:12:27.290 --> 00:12:30.440 align:middle line:84%
There's something very different
about these first five books.

00:12:30.440 --> 00:12:33.860 align:middle line:84%
The truth is, we don't really
know where they came from.

00:12:33.860 --> 00:12:35.030 align:middle line:90%
There's legend.

00:12:35.030 --> 00:12:36.260 align:middle line:90%
There's history.

00:12:36.260 --> 00:12:38.000 align:middle line:90%
There's speculation.

00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:42.170 align:middle line:10%
We're told that the book
containing the five books

00:12:42.170 --> 00:12:48.890 align:middle line:10%
was received on Mount Sinai
in Egypt as a single document.

00:12:48.890 --> 00:12:53.090 align:middle line:10%
And the ancient texts suggest
that it was a single document

00:12:53.090 --> 00:12:55.790 align:middle line:10%
that had no
punctuation, no spaces

00:12:55.790 --> 00:12:59.600 align:middle line:10%
between the words, a
single continuous output

00:12:59.600 --> 00:13:01.020 align:middle line:10%
of information.

00:13:01.020 --> 00:13:03.256 align:middle line:84%
And that's going to be
key in just a moment.

00:13:03.256 --> 00:13:05.630 align:middle line:84%
So when we talk about the
Torah, what we're talking about

00:13:05.630 --> 00:13:09.260 align:middle line:84%
are these first five
books of the Hebrew

00:13:09.260 --> 00:13:10.910 align:middle line:90%
Bible and the Christian Bible.

00:13:10.910 --> 00:13:13.440 align:middle line:84%
We're not talking about
the Bible in its entirety.

00:13:13.440 --> 00:13:15.500 align:middle line:84%
So I want to be very
clear about that.

00:13:15.500 --> 00:13:18.860 align:middle line:84%
Second thing that I
want to share with you--

00:13:18.860 --> 00:13:24.002 align:middle line:84%
I have studied, as an amateur,
linguistics all of my life.

00:13:24.002 --> 00:13:25.460 align:middle line:84%
And that's going
to become apparent

00:13:25.460 --> 00:13:27.920 align:middle line:84%
in the next episode
of this series--

00:13:27.920 --> 00:13:32.810 align:middle line:84%
the power of information being
transmitted as alphabets,

00:13:32.810 --> 00:13:36.420 align:middle line:84%
as language, and what
that means to our lives,

00:13:36.420 --> 00:13:39.125 align:middle line:84%
what it means to our bodies,
what it means to our brains.

00:13:39.125 --> 00:13:42.800 align:middle line:84%
Well, one of the fascinating
things that I discovered early

00:13:42.800 --> 00:13:46.040 align:middle line:90%
on about alphabets is this.

00:13:46.040 --> 00:13:51.470 align:middle line:10%
Every single alphabet known
to exist on this Earth

00:13:51.470 --> 00:13:55.670 align:middle line:10%
today, ancient and modern,
every letter of the alphabet

00:13:55.670 --> 00:13:58.460 align:middle line:10%
has always had a
mysterious number

00:13:58.460 --> 00:14:00.840 align:middle line:10%
associated with the letter.

00:14:00.840 --> 00:14:04.040 align:middle line:84%
We don't know for sure where
those numbers came from.

00:14:04.040 --> 00:14:05.960 align:middle line:90%
The numbers are stable.

00:14:05.960 --> 00:14:09.920 align:middle line:10%
Once those numbers were
assigned some time in antiquity,

00:14:09.920 --> 00:14:11.480 align:middle line:10%
they've never changed.

00:14:11.480 --> 00:14:16.820 align:middle line:10%
Every letter of every alphabet
has a numeric representation

00:14:16.820 --> 00:14:18.369 align:middle line:10%
for that letter.

00:14:18.369 --> 00:14:19.910 align:middle line:10%
Now some people say,
well, now you're

00:14:19.910 --> 00:14:22.252 align:middle line:10%
talking about numerology.

00:14:22.252 --> 00:14:23.710 align:middle line:84%
I want to be very
clear about this.

00:14:23.710 --> 00:14:26.900 align:middle line:84%
The science of numerology
was spelled out

00:14:26.900 --> 00:14:32.150 align:middle line:84%
in the second century
as 32 rabbinical rules

00:14:32.150 --> 00:14:36.930 align:middle line:84%
for how these numbers
may and may not be used.

00:14:36.930 --> 00:14:42.410 align:middle line:84%
So this is the science that
is called gematria or gematria

00:14:42.410 --> 00:14:46.250 align:middle line:90%
in the Hebrew language.

00:14:46.250 --> 00:14:50.180 align:middle line:84%
Numerology is a
subset of gematria.

00:14:50.180 --> 00:14:54.280 align:middle line:84%
And numerology, the
rules are very loose,

00:14:54.280 --> 00:14:56.280 align:middle line:90%
and they are malleable.

00:14:56.280 --> 00:14:59.960 align:middle line:84%
The rules for the
gematria are very strict.

00:14:59.960 --> 00:15:01.100 align:middle line:90%
They are very specific.

00:15:01.100 --> 00:15:02.570 align:middle line:90%
They're very stringent.

00:15:02.570 --> 00:15:05.490 align:middle line:84%
So I want to be very clear about
what we're talking about here.

00:15:05.490 --> 00:15:09.620 align:middle line:84%
And I'm saying this because
the alphabet of the Torah

00:15:09.620 --> 00:15:13.490 align:middle line:84%
is the Hebrew
alphabet, primarily,

00:15:13.490 --> 00:15:15.410 align:middle line:90%
in the original versions.

00:15:15.410 --> 00:15:18.170 align:middle line:84%
And every one of the letters
in the Hebrew alphabet

00:15:18.170 --> 00:15:19.940 align:middle line:84%
has always had a
mysterious number

00:15:19.940 --> 00:15:21.890 align:middle line:90%
associated with that letter.

00:15:21.890 --> 00:15:25.640 align:middle line:10%
So when we talk
about the Bible code,

00:15:25.640 --> 00:15:28.280 align:middle line:10%
the way this Bible
code is created

00:15:28.280 --> 00:15:30.260 align:middle line:10%
is that each of
those Hebrew letters

00:15:30.260 --> 00:15:34.910 align:middle line:10%
are converted into the numeric
equivalent for the letter.

00:15:34.910 --> 00:15:37.250 align:middle line:84%
So instead of seeing a bunch
of letters on the page, now

00:15:37.250 --> 00:15:40.280 align:middle line:84%
you're seeing a bunch
of numbers on the page.

00:15:40.280 --> 00:15:43.630 align:middle line:84%
Once that is done, all of
the spaces are taken out,

00:15:43.630 --> 00:15:48.350 align:middle line:84%
all of the punctuation, just the
way it was believed the Torah

00:15:48.350 --> 00:15:51.920 align:middle line:84%
was delivered to the Earth
at some point in antiquity,

00:15:51.920 --> 00:15:53.970 align:middle line:90%
3,000 years ago.

00:15:53.970 --> 00:15:57.940 align:middle line:84%
So now you're looking at a
continuous stream of numbers

00:15:57.940 --> 00:16:01.630 align:middle line:84%
creating an array or a matrix
that the computer can now

00:16:01.630 --> 00:16:05.290 align:middle line:84%
search and query
in different ways.

00:16:05.290 --> 00:16:12.300 align:middle line:84%
We're looking at a
matrix of 304,805 numbers

00:16:12.300 --> 00:16:15.570 align:middle line:90%
exactly, specifically, 304,805.

00:16:15.570 --> 00:16:19.140 align:middle line:84%
This is the number of letters
that are in the Torah.

00:16:19.140 --> 00:16:21.960 align:middle line:84%
And one of the
things that really

00:16:21.960 --> 00:16:26.130 align:middle line:84%
helps to anchor our
trust in this document

00:16:26.130 --> 00:16:28.770 align:middle line:84%
is that the Torah today
has this number of letters.

00:16:28.770 --> 00:16:31.290 align:middle line:84%
And when we go back into
the most ancient versions

00:16:31.290 --> 00:16:33.290 align:middle line:84%
of the Torah, it has the
same number of letters.

00:16:33.290 --> 00:16:36.450 align:middle line:84%
It's a very, very
stable document.

00:16:36.450 --> 00:16:41.310 align:middle line:84%
Typically, texts such
as this are translated.

00:16:41.310 --> 00:16:43.200 align:middle line:84%
And they lose information,
gain information.

00:16:43.200 --> 00:16:44.490 align:middle line:90%
They change over time.

00:16:44.490 --> 00:16:47.250 align:middle line:84%
The Torah is a very,
very stable document.

00:16:47.250 --> 00:16:51.990 align:middle line:10%
This is one of the reasons when
a rabbi is tasked with creating

00:16:51.990 --> 00:16:56.010 align:middle line:10%
a new copy of the Torah, it's
said that if even one letter

00:16:56.010 --> 00:16:59.910 align:middle line:10%
is changed, that that one
letter could change the outcome

00:16:59.910 --> 00:17:02.620 align:middle line:10%
and held the fate
for the entire world.

00:17:02.620 --> 00:17:05.634 align:middle line:10%
So if they got to the
fourth book in this document

00:17:05.634 --> 00:17:07.050 align:middle line:10%
and a mistake was
made, they would

00:17:07.050 --> 00:17:08.758 align:middle line:10%
have to destroy that
part of the document

00:17:08.758 --> 00:17:11.790 align:middle line:10%
and start over to preserve
the integrity of the Torah.

00:17:11.790 --> 00:17:15.069 align:middle line:10%
That's important for what it is
that we're talking about now.

00:17:15.069 --> 00:17:19.560 align:middle line:10%
So this matrix of
304,805 letters,

00:17:19.560 --> 00:17:23.310 align:middle line:10%
it is arranged into a matrix.

00:17:23.310 --> 00:17:25.020 align:middle line:84%
But it's called
a dynamic matrix,

00:17:25.020 --> 00:17:31.800 align:middle line:84%
because it is allowed the
change of 64 rows, 4,772

00:17:31.800 --> 00:17:33.340 align:middle line:90%
numbers in each row.

00:17:33.340 --> 00:17:35.280 align:middle line:90%
This is the way it begins.

00:17:35.280 --> 00:17:38.610 align:middle line:10%
And as the queries
begin, the queries

00:17:38.610 --> 00:17:42.250 align:middle line:10%
determine where
that matrix aligns.

00:17:42.250 --> 00:17:46.720 align:middle line:10%
So the number of numbers in a
row and the number of columns

00:17:46.720 --> 00:17:47.520 align:middle line:10%
can change.

00:17:47.520 --> 00:17:50.850 align:middle line:10%
It's a dynamic matrix
based upon the query that

00:17:50.850 --> 00:17:52.470 align:middle line:10%
is being offered.

00:17:52.470 --> 00:17:55.770 align:middle line:10%
Once the matrix is
established, then the queries

00:17:55.770 --> 00:17:59.220 align:middle line:10%
are created using
the information

00:17:59.220 --> 00:18:02.410 align:middle line:10%
that the scientific paper I
mentioned earlier talked about.

00:18:02.410 --> 00:18:05.680 align:middle line:84%
They're using what are
called Equidistant Letter

00:18:05.680 --> 00:18:08.655 align:middle line:90%
Searches, or ELS searches.

00:18:08.655 --> 00:18:10.660 align:middle line:10%
So let me talk to you
just briefly about what

00:18:10.660 --> 00:18:13.590 align:middle line:10%
an ELS search is all about.

00:18:13.590 --> 00:18:17.900 align:middle line:84%
An ELS search is commonly
called a skip code.

00:18:17.900 --> 00:18:21.090 align:middle line:10%
And that's a much easier
term to really embrace.

00:18:21.090 --> 00:18:24.540 align:middle line:10%
It means that we begin with
a particular letter somewhere

00:18:24.540 --> 00:18:29.250 align:middle line:10%
in the Torah, and we
determine how many letters

00:18:29.250 --> 00:18:33.210 align:middle line:10%
we will go through
before we expect

00:18:33.210 --> 00:18:36.540 align:middle line:10%
to find another significant
letter in that code.

00:18:36.540 --> 00:18:39.490 align:middle line:10%
It identifies what
letter in the matrix

00:18:39.490 --> 00:18:41.490 align:middle line:10%
will determine
this code sequence.

00:18:41.490 --> 00:18:44.050 align:middle line:84%
Let me give you an example
to help explain this.

00:18:44.050 --> 00:18:49.020 align:middle line:84%
Let's begin with a skip code
of 50 in the Book of Genesis--

00:18:49.020 --> 00:18:52.860 align:middle line:84%
in the Book of Genesis,
a skip code of 50.

00:18:52.860 --> 00:18:55.740 align:middle line:84%
The way we would apply
a skip code of 50

00:18:55.740 --> 00:18:58.330 align:middle line:84%
in the Book of Genesis
is very simple.

00:18:58.330 --> 00:19:01.110 align:middle line:84%
We begin with the very first
letter in the Book of Genesis.

00:19:01.110 --> 00:19:03.090 align:middle line:90%
And this is in the Hebrew code.

00:19:03.090 --> 00:19:04.540 align:middle line:90%
Now I want to be specific.

00:19:04.540 --> 00:19:07.440 align:middle line:84%
This code only works
with the Hebrew letters.

00:19:07.440 --> 00:19:10.410 align:middle line:84%
If you try to translate this
into English, it doesn't work.

00:19:10.410 --> 00:19:12.480 align:middle line:90%
The queries are only in Hebrew.

00:19:12.480 --> 00:19:15.630 align:middle line:84%
So if you're going to
query the Bible code,

00:19:15.630 --> 00:19:18.900 align:middle line:84%
you have to understand how
to query it in the language

00:19:18.900 --> 00:19:21.820 align:middle line:84%
that it was written in,
in the Hebrew language.

00:19:21.820 --> 00:19:24.990 align:middle line:84%
So in the Hebrew language,
the Book of Genesis,

00:19:24.990 --> 00:19:27.000 align:middle line:84%
a skip code of
50, we would begin

00:19:27.000 --> 00:19:28.970 align:middle line:84%
with the very first
letter of the code,

00:19:28.970 --> 00:19:30.620 align:middle line:90%
very first letter of the book.

00:19:30.620 --> 00:19:33.961 align:middle line:10%
And we would count
50 letters, or now

00:19:33.961 --> 00:19:35.460 align:middle line:10%
that the letters
have been converted

00:19:35.460 --> 00:19:38.260 align:middle line:10%
into numbers, 50 numbers over.

00:19:38.260 --> 00:19:42.420 align:middle line:10%
And when we do that, the
very first letter that we see

00:19:42.420 --> 00:19:48.390 align:middle line:10%
is the letter T. So 50 letters
in from the very first letter

00:19:48.390 --> 00:19:50.880 align:middle line:10%
of the book of Genesis
is the letter T.

00:19:50.880 --> 00:19:55.350 align:middle line:10%
When we go 50 more letters,
the next letter that we find

00:19:55.350 --> 00:19:57.840 align:middle line:10%
is the letter O.
When we go 50 more,

00:19:57.840 --> 00:20:00.660 align:middle line:10%
the next letter that we
find is the letter R.

00:20:00.660 --> 00:20:05.220 align:middle line:10%
The next letter is the letter
H. In the Hebrew language,

00:20:05.220 --> 00:20:06.810 align:middle line:10%
vowels are omitted.

00:20:06.810 --> 00:20:09.870 align:middle line:84%
So what we're seeing right
now, a skip code of 50

00:20:09.870 --> 00:20:12.010 align:middle line:90%
could be considered a primer.

00:20:12.010 --> 00:20:14.400 align:middle line:84%
It tells us of how
this code works.

00:20:14.400 --> 00:20:17.790 align:middle line:10%
And it tells us that a skip
code of 50 in the Torah

00:20:17.790 --> 00:20:20.220 align:middle line:10%
produces the word Torah.

00:20:20.220 --> 00:20:21.680 align:middle line:10%
So this is one of
the first things

00:20:21.680 --> 00:20:24.910 align:middle line:10%
that biblical scholars
found a long time ago.

00:20:24.910 --> 00:20:27.090 align:middle line:10%
And based on this,
they said, what happens

00:20:27.090 --> 00:20:29.130 align:middle line:10%
if we try other skip zip codes?

00:20:29.130 --> 00:20:31.680 align:middle line:84%
What happens if we allow
the computer to use

00:20:31.680 --> 00:20:34.320 align:middle line:90%
those skips codes for us?

00:20:34.320 --> 00:20:37.200 align:middle line:84%
The results of this
work were made popular

00:20:37.200 --> 00:20:39.930 align:middle line:84%
in the mainstream
in the year 1997.

00:20:39.930 --> 00:20:41.970 align:middle line:84%
They were released
as a book that

00:20:41.970 --> 00:20:45.030 align:middle line:84%
was called "The Bible Code,"
the author, a journalist.

00:20:45.030 --> 00:20:47.100 align:middle line:90%
His name was Michael Drosnin.

00:20:47.100 --> 00:20:49.650 align:middle line:84%
So maybe you read the book, the
first book, "The Bible Code."

00:20:49.650 --> 00:20:53.890 align:middle line:84%
And there were many subsequent
books that came later.

00:20:53.890 --> 00:20:57.660 align:middle line:84%
So I mentioned earlier
that specific details

00:20:57.660 --> 00:21:02.760 align:middle line:84%
of the assassination for Yitzhak
Rabin were in the Torah code,

00:21:02.760 --> 00:21:03.630 align:middle line:90%
in the Bible code.

00:21:03.630 --> 00:21:05.380 align:middle line:84%
Now I want to give
you an example

00:21:05.380 --> 00:21:06.830 align:middle line:90%
of exactly where I mean.

00:21:06.830 --> 00:21:10.840 align:middle line:10%
If you look on your screen, you
can see how this code works.

00:21:10.840 --> 00:21:15.970 align:middle line:10%
What you're seeing is a matrix
of a part of the Torah codes.

00:21:15.970 --> 00:21:19.810 align:middle line:10%
And when the algorithms
are given the instructions

00:21:19.810 --> 00:21:24.130 align:middle line:10%
to search in the code, they can
search vertically in columns,

00:21:24.130 --> 00:21:26.710 align:middle line:10%
they can search
horizontally in rows,

00:21:26.710 --> 00:21:28.480 align:middle line:10%
and they can search diagonally.

00:21:28.480 --> 00:21:31.090 align:middle line:10%
And you'll see examples
of each of these.

00:21:31.090 --> 00:21:35.320 align:middle line:84%
What the mathematicians said
is that if we find words that

00:21:35.320 --> 00:21:38.170 align:middle line:84%
are related to one
another within what

00:21:38.170 --> 00:21:42.280 align:middle line:84%
is called a statistically
significant distance--

00:21:42.280 --> 00:21:45.430 align:middle line:84%
so they have
calculations to tell us

00:21:45.430 --> 00:21:47.800 align:middle line:84%
if the distance from
one word to another

00:21:47.800 --> 00:21:49.600 align:middle line:90%
is statistically significant.

00:21:49.600 --> 00:21:52.390 align:middle line:84%
If it's not-- if in
one part of the code,

00:21:52.390 --> 00:21:56.170 align:middle line:84%
you find Yitzhak Rabin,
and 500 pages later,

00:21:56.170 --> 00:21:58.030 align:middle line:84%
you find the date of
his assassination--

00:21:58.030 --> 00:22:01.430 align:middle line:84%
that would not be called
statistically significant.

00:22:01.430 --> 00:22:02.980 align:middle line:84%
But what you're
seeing on the screen

00:22:02.980 --> 00:22:06.820 align:middle line:84%
is where these words
actually intersect.

00:22:06.820 --> 00:22:09.340 align:middle line:84%
So what you're seeing
is a place in the code

00:22:09.340 --> 00:22:12.040 align:middle line:84%
where the name "Yitzhak
Rabin" is actually

00:22:12.040 --> 00:22:14.150 align:middle line:90%
spelled out vertically.

00:22:14.150 --> 00:22:18.310 align:middle line:84%
And you see that, horizontally,
the phrase "assassin

00:22:18.310 --> 00:22:21.670 align:middle line:84%
who will assassinate"--
it's very specific--

00:22:21.670 --> 00:22:22.970 align:middle line:90%
spelled out horizontally.

00:22:22.970 --> 00:22:25.690 align:middle line:84%
And it intersects
the name of the man

00:22:25.690 --> 00:22:28.050 align:middle line:84%
that this information
is directed to.

00:22:28.050 --> 00:22:32.170 align:middle line:10%
Well, the information goes
beyond just saying "assassin

00:22:32.170 --> 00:22:34.090 align:middle line:10%
who will assassinate."

00:22:34.090 --> 00:22:37.420 align:middle line:10%
The time of day is
encoded in the Torah code.

00:22:37.420 --> 00:22:40.240 align:middle line:10%
The name of the assassin--
his name was Amir--

00:22:40.240 --> 00:22:42.670 align:middle line:10%
Amir is encoded in this.

00:22:42.670 --> 00:22:45.460 align:middle line:10%
The street upon which the
assassination occurred,

00:22:45.460 --> 00:22:49.670 align:middle line:10%
it's all encoded
in this Torah code.

00:22:49.670 --> 00:22:51.700 align:middle line:84%
And Yitzhak Rabin,
when he was told

00:22:51.700 --> 00:22:53.920 align:middle line:84%
that the information
of his death

00:22:53.920 --> 00:22:57.880 align:middle line:84%
was encoded in the
Torah, what he said is,

00:22:57.880 --> 00:23:00.580 align:middle line:84%
"If it's in the Bible,
then it is meant to be.

00:23:00.580 --> 00:23:05.230 align:middle line:84%
And I'm going to go forward with
my plans as originally made."

00:23:05.230 --> 00:23:06.070 align:middle line:90%
He did.

00:23:06.070 --> 00:23:10.120 align:middle line:84%
And the outcome was what
we now know as history.

00:23:10.120 --> 00:23:12.430 align:middle line:10%
Now one of the questions
that has come up

00:23:12.430 --> 00:23:16.270 align:middle line:10%
is, what if Yitzhak Rabin
had heeded the warning?

00:23:16.270 --> 00:23:19.690 align:middle line:10%
What if he had not made the
public display on the day

00:23:19.690 --> 00:23:20.770 align:middle line:10%
that he did?

00:23:20.770 --> 00:23:23.320 align:middle line:10%
What would the Bible
code tell us about that?

00:23:23.320 --> 00:23:25.300 align:middle line:84%
Well, when that
query was entered,

00:23:25.300 --> 00:23:28.810 align:middle line:84%
very interestingly, it
still came up with his name.

00:23:28.810 --> 00:23:30.530 align:middle line:84%
It still came up
with "assassination"

00:23:30.530 --> 00:23:31.780 align:middle line:90%
across the name.

00:23:31.780 --> 00:23:35.980 align:middle line:84%
And off to the side, it said
"assassination delayed"--

00:23:35.980 --> 00:23:38.470 align:middle line:90%
"assassination delayed."

00:23:38.470 --> 00:23:41.650 align:middle line:84%
Somehow, the Bible code
knew that it would not

00:23:41.650 --> 00:23:44.230 align:middle line:90%
happen precisely on that day.

00:23:44.230 --> 00:23:46.680 align:middle line:84%
Now I'm going to give you
some other examples of how

00:23:46.680 --> 00:23:47.480 align:middle line:90%
this works.

00:23:47.480 --> 00:23:49.990 align:middle line:84%
But the point here
is this information

00:23:49.990 --> 00:23:53.080 align:middle line:84%
is encoded in a
document that was

00:23:53.080 --> 00:23:56.050 align:middle line:84%
given to the people of
the Earth 3,000 years ago.

00:23:56.050 --> 00:23:57.940 align:middle line:90%
How could this be possible?

00:23:57.940 --> 00:24:02.410 align:middle line:84%
How is it possible to
encode so many potentials

00:24:02.410 --> 00:24:06.670 align:middle line:84%
of so many outcomes in
such a precise way for all

00:24:06.670 --> 00:24:08.360 align:middle line:90%
of the people of the world?

00:24:08.360 --> 00:24:09.880 align:middle line:84%
Now I'm going to
re-emphasize this.

00:24:09.880 --> 00:24:13.480 align:middle line:84%
Every name that has ever
been entered is in the code.

00:24:13.480 --> 00:24:15.730 align:middle line:10%
And the details, my details--

00:24:15.730 --> 00:24:18.040 align:middle line:10%
where I lived, who
my parents were,

00:24:18.040 --> 00:24:21.460 align:middle line:10%
how old I was when
my family split up--

00:24:21.460 --> 00:24:25.240 align:middle line:10%
all of this information, all
this is in the code for me,

00:24:25.240 --> 00:24:27.322 align:middle line:10%
and it is for you as well.

00:24:27.322 --> 00:24:29.530 align:middle line:10%
There are other examples of
what we find in the code.

00:24:29.530 --> 00:24:34.270 align:middle line:10%
The time and the date
for the atomic detonation

00:24:34.270 --> 00:24:37.210 align:middle line:10%
of Hiroshima-- you're seeing
this on the screen right now--

00:24:37.210 --> 00:24:40.510 align:middle line:10%
the exact date, 1945, the
words "atomic holocaust."

00:24:40.510 --> 00:24:42.580 align:middle line:10%
Look at how they cross.

00:24:42.580 --> 00:24:45.340 align:middle line:10%
The assassination of
President John F. Kennedy--

00:24:45.340 --> 00:24:46.560 align:middle line:10%
it's in the code.

00:24:46.560 --> 00:24:48.910 align:middle line:10%
And this is an example of
a little bit of a diagonal.

00:24:48.910 --> 00:24:52.960 align:middle line:10%
You can see the word
"Dallas" in the diagonal.

00:24:52.960 --> 00:24:57.850 align:middle line:10%
And you see his name
as the vertical.

00:24:57.850 --> 00:25:01.120 align:middle line:10%
And you actually see
the words "to die."

00:25:01.120 --> 00:25:07.600 align:middle line:10%
It says "to die," referencing
both of these things together.

00:25:07.600 --> 00:25:11.080 align:middle line:84%
September 11 that I spoke about
a couple of episodes earlier--

00:25:11.080 --> 00:25:12.950 align:middle line:90%
it's in the Bible code.

00:25:12.950 --> 00:25:16.511 align:middle line:10%
I'm not surprised, because this
is such a significant event.

00:25:16.511 --> 00:25:18.010 align:middle line:10%
But I want you to
see on the screen.

00:25:18.010 --> 00:25:21.250 align:middle line:10%
Look on your screen, and you
can see how it's encoded.

00:25:21.250 --> 00:25:24.580 align:middle line:10%
The word "twin
towers" is vertical.

00:25:24.580 --> 00:25:29.580 align:middle line:10%
What you see is the words
"knocked down" twice

00:25:29.580 --> 00:25:32.560 align:middle line:10%
and the word "airplane,"
all within statistically

00:25:32.560 --> 00:25:36.100 align:middle line:10%
significant relationships
to what we're seeing here.

00:25:36.100 --> 00:25:38.566 align:middle line:84%
Now one of the things that
the scholars believe--

00:25:38.566 --> 00:25:39.940 align:middle line:84%
the mathematicians--
they believe

00:25:39.940 --> 00:25:42.050 align:middle line:84%
that, although
they're onto the code,

00:25:42.050 --> 00:25:44.110 align:middle line:84%
they are not completely
onto the code,

00:25:44.110 --> 00:25:45.975 align:middle line:84%
that they haven't
completely solved it.

00:25:45.975 --> 00:25:47.350 align:middle line:84%
Because what we're
looking at are

00:25:47.350 --> 00:25:49.600 align:middle line:90%
fragments or bits and pieces.

00:25:49.600 --> 00:25:52.300 align:middle line:84%
But it may be because
that is the way

00:25:52.300 --> 00:25:53.870 align:middle line:90%
that this code was designed.

00:25:53.870 --> 00:25:57.520 align:middle line:84%
It's not designed to
predict the future.

00:25:57.520 --> 00:26:03.070 align:middle line:10%
It is designed to tell us the
consequences of our choices.

00:26:03.070 --> 00:26:08.090 align:middle line:10%
Even the election of President
Obama is in the Torah codes.

00:26:08.090 --> 00:26:12.520 align:middle line:84%
So there's a very famous image
of Obama actually looking

00:26:12.520 --> 00:26:14.080 align:middle line:90%
at the great Isaiah scroll.

00:26:14.080 --> 00:26:16.180 align:middle line:84%
This is the most complete
of the Dead Sea Scrolls.

00:26:16.180 --> 00:26:21.670 align:middle line:84%
It is completely unrolled on
the replica of a large Torah

00:26:21.670 --> 00:26:23.860 align:middle line:84%
vertically in the Shrine
of the Book Museum.

00:26:23.860 --> 00:26:25.810 align:middle line:90%
And Obama is looking.

00:26:25.810 --> 00:26:27.850 align:middle line:84%
And it's believed
that he was looking

00:26:27.850 --> 00:26:31.700 align:middle line:84%
to see where his name and
the details for his election

00:26:31.700 --> 00:26:33.970 align:middle line:84%
and his presidency
and the outcome

00:26:33.970 --> 00:26:36.580 align:middle line:84%
were contained in
the Torah codes.

00:26:36.580 --> 00:26:39.640 align:middle line:84%
So this is so fascinating
to me, because when

00:26:39.640 --> 00:26:43.270 align:middle line:84%
we look at the words
themselves, the words

00:26:43.270 --> 00:26:47.380 align:middle line:84%
tell a story in a language
that we recognize.

00:26:47.380 --> 00:26:50.590 align:middle line:84%
Underlying that
story, the mathematics

00:26:50.590 --> 00:26:53.620 align:middle line:84%
are telling another
story on a deeper level.

00:26:53.620 --> 00:26:56.790 align:middle line:84%
That is the mystery
of the Bible code.

00:26:56.790 --> 00:26:59.670 align:middle line:84%
Now I want to be
very clear once again

00:26:59.670 --> 00:27:03.570 align:middle line:84%
that the code doesn't tell
us what is going to happen.

00:27:03.570 --> 00:27:05.790 align:middle line:90%
It talks about potentials.

00:27:05.790 --> 00:27:07.980 align:middle line:84%
And one of the potentials--
and this is, I think,

00:27:07.980 --> 00:27:11.340 align:middle line:84%
the most powerful, powerful
thing we can know about

00:27:11.340 --> 00:27:13.710 align:middle line:84%
the Torah codes, about
the Bible codes--

00:27:13.710 --> 00:27:18.410 align:middle line:84%
is that whenever the Bible code
shows something frightening

00:27:18.410 --> 00:27:22.040 align:middle line:84%
that is possible, that is
potential in our world,

00:27:22.040 --> 00:27:24.770 align:middle line:84%
next to that
frightening possibility,

00:27:24.770 --> 00:27:28.040 align:middle line:84%
there is always a phrase
that gives us hope.

00:27:28.040 --> 00:27:30.230 align:middle line:90%
And the phrase is this.

00:27:30.230 --> 00:27:33.500 align:middle line:84%
When we find the most
frightening examples

00:27:33.500 --> 00:27:36.530 align:middle line:84%
of atomic holocaust
or war or pandemic

00:27:36.530 --> 00:27:39.290 align:middle line:84%
or whatever it is,
the Bible code always

00:27:39.290 --> 00:27:43.670 align:middle line:84%
comes up with the phrase
"Will you change it?"

00:27:43.670 --> 00:27:46.690 align:middle line:90%
"Will you change it?"

00:27:46.690 --> 00:27:50.920 align:middle line:84%
This 3,000-year-old code
is not only telling us what

00:27:50.920 --> 00:27:53.770 align:middle line:84%
the consequences
may be for a choice.

00:27:53.770 --> 00:27:57.100 align:middle line:84%
It's telling us that
we have the opportunity

00:27:57.100 --> 00:27:58.660 align:middle line:90%
to change that outcome.

00:27:58.660 --> 00:28:00.020 align:middle line:90%
"Will you change it?"

00:28:00.020 --> 00:28:00.820 align:middle line:90%
So beautiful.

00:28:00.820 --> 00:28:02.880 align:middle line:90%
So powerful.

00:28:02.880 --> 00:28:04.860 align:middle line:10%
The last example
of the Bible code

00:28:04.860 --> 00:28:07.290 align:middle line:10%
that I want to share
with you was one

00:28:07.290 --> 00:28:11.340 align:middle line:10%
that impressed me so deeply.

00:28:11.340 --> 00:28:14.280 align:middle line:10%
And you're seeing it on
your screen right now.

00:28:14.280 --> 00:28:18.630 align:middle line:10%
It is the part of the code
that says that the code itself

00:28:18.630 --> 00:28:21.840 align:middle line:10%
was sealed until what is
called "the end of time."

00:28:21.840 --> 00:28:24.405 align:middle line:84%
Now the end of time,
many people interpret it

00:28:24.405 --> 00:28:25.650 align:middle line:90%
as the end of the world.

00:28:25.650 --> 00:28:28.020 align:middle line:84%
But that's certainly not how
the Mayans interpreted it.

00:28:28.020 --> 00:28:30.030 align:middle line:84%
It's not how mathematicians
interpret it.

00:28:30.030 --> 00:28:31.860 align:middle line:84%
And if you understand
cycles, it's

00:28:31.860 --> 00:28:33.390 align:middle line:84%
not what the cycles
are telling us.

00:28:33.390 --> 00:28:35.340 align:middle line:84%
Because the end of one
cycle, by definition,

00:28:35.340 --> 00:28:36.840 align:middle line:84%
is always the
beginning of the next.

00:28:36.840 --> 00:28:39.510 align:middle line:84%
It's the beginning of what
comes next, of the new.

00:28:39.510 --> 00:28:42.660 align:middle line:84%
We are living the close
of a great cycle of time,

00:28:42.660 --> 00:28:46.530 align:middle line:84%
a 5,125-year cycle,
and by definition,

00:28:46.530 --> 00:28:48.320 align:middle line:90%
the beginning of a new cycle.

00:28:48.320 --> 00:28:50.580 align:middle line:90%
We are living the end of time.

00:28:50.580 --> 00:28:52.200 align:middle line:10%
And it's only now,
at the end of time,

00:28:52.200 --> 00:28:55.080 align:middle line:10%
when our computers
and the mathematics

00:28:55.080 --> 00:28:56.760 align:middle line:10%
have come together
in a way that allows

00:28:56.760 --> 00:29:00.210 align:middle line:10%
us to unlock the mystery of this
code and to reap its benefits.

00:29:00.210 --> 00:29:03.890 align:middle line:84%
The code is sealed
until the end of time.

00:29:03.890 --> 00:29:05.760 align:middle line:10%
And that's what we're
seeing in the code

00:29:05.760 --> 00:29:07.010 align:middle line:10%
that you're seeing right now.

00:29:07.010 --> 00:29:09.840 align:middle line:10%
And the word "computer"
is right next to it.

00:29:09.840 --> 00:29:12.720 align:middle line:84%
So once again, the
Torah code is telling us

00:29:12.720 --> 00:29:15.840 align:middle line:84%
about what's possible
in our lives.

00:29:15.840 --> 00:29:21.150 align:middle line:84%
If time is actually a program
running under the operating

00:29:21.150 --> 00:29:25.370 align:middle line:84%
system of the Divine
Matrix, as we expressed

00:29:25.370 --> 00:29:28.620 align:middle line:84%
in the couple of episodes
prior to this one, then

00:29:28.620 --> 00:29:29.820 align:middle line:90%
the Torah code--

00:29:29.820 --> 00:29:32.700 align:middle line:84%
the Bible code that we
have just explored--

00:29:32.700 --> 00:29:37.350 align:middle line:84%
can be thought of as
the manual that tells us

00:29:37.350 --> 00:29:40.200 align:middle line:90%
what is happening within time.

00:29:40.200 --> 00:29:43.500 align:middle line:84%
The Torah codes are the
manual for the possibilities

00:29:43.500 --> 00:29:46.050 align:middle line:90%
within time.

00:29:46.050 --> 00:29:48.080 align:middle line:84%
So once again, we've
covered a tremendous amount

00:29:48.080 --> 00:29:51.020 align:middle line:90%
of information in this episode.

00:29:51.020 --> 00:29:53.130 align:middle line:84%
To bring this all
together, the beauty

00:29:53.130 --> 00:29:55.560 align:middle line:84%
of understanding
the Torah code is

00:29:55.560 --> 00:29:58.710 align:middle line:84%
that the Torah code is
the map of possibilities

00:29:58.710 --> 00:30:01.590 align:middle line:84%
within the program of time,
running under the Divine

00:30:01.590 --> 00:30:02.700 align:middle line:90%
Matrix.

00:30:02.700 --> 00:30:04.830 align:middle line:84%
We are part of that
program of time.

00:30:04.830 --> 00:30:08.370 align:middle line:84%
And we are subject to the
rules and the laws of time

00:30:08.370 --> 00:30:10.030 align:middle line:90%
until we understand them.

00:30:10.030 --> 00:30:13.050 align:middle line:84%
And then we also understand
that our biology gives us

00:30:13.050 --> 00:30:15.030 align:middle line:90%
the way to hack time.

00:30:15.030 --> 00:30:17.940 align:middle line:84%
We can short-circuit
the processes.

00:30:17.940 --> 00:30:19.449 align:middle line:84%
We can short-circuit
these cycles

00:30:19.449 --> 00:30:21.240 align:middle line:84%
when it comes to the
healing of our bodies,

00:30:21.240 --> 00:30:24.360 align:middle line:84%
for example, or the
peace between nations.

00:30:24.360 --> 00:30:28.020 align:middle line:84%
And all of this is
possible because we are now

00:30:28.020 --> 00:30:32.520 align:middle line:84%
unlocking the mystery, and
we're telling a new human story.

00:30:32.520 --> 00:30:35.910 align:middle line:84%
And it's a story of us and our
relationship to the matrix that

00:30:35.910 --> 00:30:37.365 align:middle line:90%
underlies all reality.

00:30:37.365 --> 00:30:40.174 align:middle line:90%


00:30:40.174 --> 00:30:42.340 align:middle line:84%
Whether we're looking at
the big events of the world

00:30:42.340 --> 00:30:45.310 align:middle line:84%
or the details of our
everyday lives, everything

00:30:45.310 --> 00:30:49.240 align:middle line:84%
that we experience, it's
happening within possibilities

00:30:49.240 --> 00:30:52.030 align:middle line:84%
already coded into the
ancient map of time,

00:30:52.030 --> 00:30:53.740 align:middle line:90%
into the Bible code.

00:30:53.740 --> 00:30:56.380 align:middle line:84%
The scientific key to
choosing our possibilities

00:30:56.380 --> 00:30:58.330 align:middle line:84%
was preserved in
some of the most

00:30:58.330 --> 00:31:01.090 align:middle line:84%
ancient and indigenous
languages of the past.

00:31:01.090 --> 00:31:02.920 align:middle line:84%
In the next episode,
we'll discover

00:31:02.920 --> 00:31:06.379 align:middle line:84%
that key, how it works, and
what it means in our lives.

00:31:06.379 --> 00:31:08.170 align:middle line:84%
So I want to thank you
for joining me today
