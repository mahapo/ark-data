00:00:25.964 --> 00:00:26.880 align:middle line:90%
>>GREGG BRADEN: Hello.

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:28.440 align:middle line:10%
My name's Gregg
Braden and I'd like

00:00:28.440 --> 00:00:31.140 align:middle line:10%
to welcome you to this
very special presentation

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:35.460 align:middle line:10%
of "Missing Links: Simulation
by Design: Are We Living

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:37.830 align:middle line:10%
in a Virtual Reality?"

00:00:37.830 --> 00:00:40.410 align:middle line:84%
In the last episode,
we went beyond asking

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:43.260 align:middle line:84%
what if to this question,
with the studies

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:45.450 align:middle line:84%
now showing that
it's more likely

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:48.000 align:middle line:84%
than not that we are
living in a simulation.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.160 align:middle line:90%
The question now becomes, why?

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:51.540 align:middle line:90%
What are we learning?

00:00:51.540 --> 00:00:54.680 align:middle line:84%
Well, the clue to our
answer is in plain sight

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:57.750 align:middle line:84%
of everyday life; in the
biology of life itself

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:01.850 align:middle line:84%
and our ability to
self-regulate our own bodies.

00:01:01.850 --> 00:01:04.459 align:middle line:84%
In this episode, let's
explore these ideas--

00:01:04.459 --> 00:01:07.020 align:middle line:84%
who built our simulation,
what are we learning

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:09.600 align:middle line:90%
from this cosmic program?

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:11.730 align:middle line:84%
There are two schools
of thought when

00:01:11.730 --> 00:01:16.050 align:middle line:84%
it comes to the beginning of our
universe and our place in it.

00:01:16.050 --> 00:01:18.630 align:middle line:84%
The first school
of thought suggests

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:23.160 align:middle line:84%
that we are the product of
an unimaginably lucky series

00:01:23.160 --> 00:01:27.000 align:middle line:84%
of events where just the
right conditions appeared

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:30.180 align:middle line:84%
in just the right way
at just the right time

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:32.670 align:middle line:84%
to create the perfect
environment to form

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:36.000 align:middle line:84%
the perfect atoms that combined
in just the right proportions

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:38.490 align:middle line:84%
to form the first elements
that gave birth to the very

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:40.470 align:middle line:90%
first DNA molecule of life.

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:46.390 align:middle line:90%


00:01:46.390 --> 00:01:50.920 align:middle line:10%
Mathematician Chandra
Wickramasinghe says the odds

00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:53.200 align:middle line:10%
of this happening--
the mathematical odds--

00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:57.445 align:middle line:10%
are about 1 in 10 to 40,000th.

00:01:57.445 --> 00:02:02.410 align:middle line:10%
So just to be clear, that's a
one with 40,000 zeros after it.

00:02:02.410 --> 00:02:06.850 align:middle line:84%
Just to give you some idea
of how absurd these odds are

00:02:06.850 --> 00:02:10.840 align:middle line:84%
that this could have
happened purely by chance,

00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:12.625 align:middle line:84%
scientists generally
agree that when

00:02:12.625 --> 00:02:15.580 align:middle line:84%
the odds of something
happening are 1 to 10

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:19.660 align:middle line:84%
in the 110th or more,
that we say that something

00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:21.640 align:middle line:90%
is pretty much impossible.

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:25.030 align:middle line:84%
So now we're talking about
one to the 40,000ths.

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:28.840 align:middle line:84%
But for the non-mathematician,
astronomer Fred Hoyle

00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:31.720 align:middle line:84%
offers another
analogy that I love.

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:36.310 align:middle line:10%
He said, the odds of
life forming randomly--

00:02:36.310 --> 00:02:40.540 align:middle line:10%
of the first DNA molecule
forming completely randomly

00:02:40.540 --> 00:02:42.670 align:middle line:10%
under natural
conditions-- he said,

00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:45.880 align:middle line:10%
those odds are the
equivalent of a tornado

00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:51.070 align:middle line:10%
sweeping through a junkyard
and assembling a Boeing 747

00:02:51.070 --> 00:02:53.944 align:middle line:10%
jetliner from the
scattered debris.

00:02:53.944 --> 00:02:56.110 align:middle line:10%
Well, I think we can all
agree that this is probably

00:02:56.110 --> 00:02:59.590 align:middle line:10%
never going to happen, that's
how steep those odds are.

00:02:59.590 --> 00:03:02.415 align:middle line:84%
And that's why we look to
the second possibility.

00:03:02.415 --> 00:03:05.650 align:middle line:84%
The second possibility
suggests that we

00:03:05.650 --> 00:03:09.790 align:middle line:84%
are the product of an
ancient simulation,

00:03:09.790 --> 00:03:14.650 align:middle line:84%
a computerized virtual reality
that was set into motion long

00:03:14.650 --> 00:03:21.280 align:middle line:84%
ago in our ancient past as the
cosmic machinery that churns

00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:24.760 align:middle line:84%
out information and
energy, the ones

00:03:24.760 --> 00:03:26.860 align:middle line:84%
and zeros, the
elements of the atoms

00:03:26.860 --> 00:03:29.630 align:middle line:84%
that make our physical
reality a possibility.

00:03:29.630 --> 00:03:33.920 align:middle line:84%
It's a process that's continuing
today right this moment.

00:03:33.920 --> 00:03:38.930 align:middle line:10%
MIT Physicist Seth Lloyd
supported this idea in a book

00:03:38.930 --> 00:03:43.830 align:middle line:10%
that he wrote in 2006 entitled
"Programming the Universe."

00:03:43.830 --> 00:03:45.770 align:middle line:10%
He suggested that
the universe itself

00:03:45.770 --> 00:03:50.900 align:middle line:10%
is one big quantum computer
producing what we see around

00:03:50.900 --> 00:03:56.570 align:middle line:10%
us, and us, as it runs this
massive computer program.

00:03:56.570 --> 00:03:59.510 align:middle line:84%
So regardless of which
idea turns out to be true--

00:03:59.510 --> 00:04:02.630 align:middle line:84%
whether or not we are, in
fact, the product of this

00:04:02.630 --> 00:04:07.430 align:middle line:84%
unimaginably lucky series of
events or if we are the product

00:04:07.430 --> 00:04:13.050 align:middle line:84%
of a simulation an
intentional virtual reality--

00:04:13.050 --> 00:04:15.650 align:middle line:84%
the questions that we're
trying to answer right now

00:04:15.650 --> 00:04:18.140 align:middle line:90%
are still the same two big ones.

00:04:18.140 --> 00:04:21.470 align:middle line:84%
First question, who
built this simulation?

00:04:21.470 --> 00:04:23.390 align:middle line:84%
Who could have started
something like this

00:04:23.390 --> 00:04:25.970 align:middle line:84%
long ago in our ancient
past, number one?

00:04:25.970 --> 00:04:30.170 align:middle line:84%
Number two, what are we
learning in this cosmic program?

00:04:30.170 --> 00:04:31.790 align:middle line:90%
Are we here just for fun?

00:04:31.790 --> 00:04:34.310 align:middle line:84%
Is this an amusement
and entertainment,

00:04:34.310 --> 00:04:35.900 align:middle line:90%
or is there a need--

00:04:35.900 --> 00:04:37.820 align:middle line:84%
as we mentioned in
previous episodes--

00:04:37.820 --> 00:04:42.050 align:middle line:84%
is there a possibility that
we are immersing ourselves

00:04:42.050 --> 00:04:47.240 align:middle line:84%
into an environment to learn a
way of being here in this world

00:04:47.240 --> 00:04:50.360 align:middle line:84%
that we need because we're
going somewhere else where

00:04:50.360 --> 00:04:52.910 align:middle line:84%
those skills and
that way of being

00:04:52.910 --> 00:04:54.935 align:middle line:90%
is going to be a necessity?

00:04:54.935 --> 00:04:57.980 align:middle line:84%
Well, let's explore
both of these.

00:04:57.980 --> 00:05:01.310 align:middle line:84%
A clue as to who
built our simulation

00:05:01.310 --> 00:05:04.820 align:middle line:84%
can be found from
asking ourselves, who

00:05:04.820 --> 00:05:07.590 align:middle line:90%
benefits from the simulation?

00:05:07.590 --> 00:05:10.310 align:middle line:84%
Well, as in any
simulation, those

00:05:10.310 --> 00:05:13.490 align:middle line:84%
who are actually
experiencing the simulation

00:05:13.490 --> 00:05:15.270 align:middle line:84%
are the ones that
are benefiting.

00:05:15.270 --> 00:05:18.920 align:middle line:84%
And that means
that you and me, we

00:05:18.920 --> 00:05:21.290 align:middle line:84%
are benefiting from
this simulation.

00:05:21.290 --> 00:05:24.060 align:middle line:84%
Is it possible that we're
the ones that built it?

00:05:24.060 --> 00:05:27.710 align:middle line:84%
Is it possible that
we are the product

00:05:27.710 --> 00:05:30.604 align:middle line:84%
of an advanced civilization
that has, in fact, lived

00:05:30.604 --> 00:05:32.270 align:middle line:84%
through some of the
scenarios that we've

00:05:32.270 --> 00:05:35.000 align:middle line:84%
talked about earlier
in these programs

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:38.720 align:middle line:84%
and that we are the
pioneers, that we are

00:05:38.720 --> 00:05:41.100 align:middle line:84%
the explorers, that
we are the ones that

00:05:41.100 --> 00:05:43.730 align:middle line:84%
have immersed ourselves into
this alternate reality--

00:05:43.730 --> 00:05:46.720 align:middle line:84%
temporarily the
Maya, the illusion--

00:05:46.720 --> 00:05:48.620 align:middle line:84%
so that we can
learn a way of being

00:05:48.620 --> 00:05:50.570 align:middle line:84%
and share that way
of being with others

00:05:50.570 --> 00:05:53.420 align:middle line:84%
here because we're going
somewhere where we're going

00:05:53.420 --> 00:05:57.520 align:middle line:90%
to need this way of being?

00:05:57.520 --> 00:06:00.860 align:middle line:84%
Well, when we think about
the idea of a simulation,

00:06:00.860 --> 00:06:06.950 align:middle line:84%
this answer becomes even clearer
as we examine our relationship

00:06:06.950 --> 00:06:09.200 align:middle line:90%
to our physical reality.

00:06:09.200 --> 00:06:10.850 align:middle line:84%
We know, as we
mentioned previously,

00:06:10.850 --> 00:06:13.183 align:middle line:84%
that there's a field of energy
that connects all things.

00:06:13.183 --> 00:06:14.270 align:middle line:90%
We know that.

00:06:14.270 --> 00:06:17.120 align:middle line:84%
We also know that we
are part of that field.

00:06:17.120 --> 00:06:21.890 align:middle line:84%
We know that human
DNA actually interacts

00:06:21.890 --> 00:06:26.420 align:middle line:84%
with the photons of atoms, the
stuff this world is made of.

00:06:26.420 --> 00:06:29.690 align:middle line:84%
And we know that
human emotion changes

00:06:29.690 --> 00:06:34.350 align:middle line:84%
the DNA that changes the
stuff this world is made of.

00:06:34.350 --> 00:06:38.750 align:middle line:84%
It means that we are immersed
in an interactive reality where

00:06:38.750 --> 00:06:41.030 align:middle line:84%
the choices that we
make in our lives--

00:06:41.030 --> 00:06:45.770 align:middle line:84%
the choices of our emotions, of
our feelings, of our thoughts,

00:06:45.770 --> 00:06:47.390 align:middle line:90%
of our beliefs--

00:06:47.390 --> 00:06:49.380 align:middle line:90%
are changing our biology.

00:06:49.380 --> 00:06:51.860 align:middle line:84%
They're changing our
chemistry and allowing

00:06:51.860 --> 00:06:56.390 align:middle line:84%
us to interact and change
the chemistry of the field

00:06:56.390 --> 00:06:59.060 align:middle line:84%
that we find
ourselves immersed in.

00:06:59.060 --> 00:07:02.690 align:middle line:84%
So we ask ourselves the
question, what are we learning?

00:07:02.690 --> 00:07:05.660 align:middle line:84%
We must assume that
whatever we're learning

00:07:05.660 --> 00:07:09.140 align:middle line:84%
has something to do with
this deep relationship

00:07:09.140 --> 00:07:12.860 align:middle line:84%
that we have with our
reality with our ability

00:07:12.860 --> 00:07:17.600 align:middle line:84%
to self-regulate
ourselves from within so

00:07:17.600 --> 00:07:22.010 align:middle line:84%
that we can experience the
results of that self-regulation

00:07:22.010 --> 00:07:24.060 align:middle line:90%
in the world around us.

00:07:24.060 --> 00:07:25.880 align:middle line:84%
Maybe we're going to
a world where this

00:07:25.880 --> 00:07:28.130 align:middle line:90%
is going to be very important.

00:07:28.130 --> 00:07:30.230 align:middle line:84%
It's interesting,
scientists have

00:07:30.230 --> 00:07:33.980 align:middle line:84%
found that here
on Earth, we live

00:07:33.980 --> 00:07:36.530 align:middle line:84%
in a world of very
high magnetic fields.

00:07:36.530 --> 00:07:41.080 align:middle line:84%
There's a very strong magnetic
field that surrounds the Earth

00:07:41.080 --> 00:07:43.280 align:middle line:84%
and there is a very
powerful magnetic field

00:07:43.280 --> 00:07:45.590 align:middle line:84%
within your body--
two of them, actually.

00:07:45.590 --> 00:07:48.650 align:middle line:84%
One of them is in the brain
and the second is in the heart.

00:07:48.650 --> 00:07:51.290 align:middle line:84%
And the heart is the
strongest magnetic field

00:07:51.290 --> 00:07:53.190 align:middle line:90%
in the human body.

00:07:53.190 --> 00:07:56.810 align:middle line:84%
Well, the reason I'm saying
this is because what we now know

00:07:56.810 --> 00:08:03.560 align:middle line:84%
is that magnetic field
produces a lag in the time

00:08:03.560 --> 00:08:06.380 align:middle line:84%
that we have an
experience and when

00:08:06.380 --> 00:08:09.590 align:middle line:84%
we see that experience
reflected either in our bodies

00:08:09.590 --> 00:08:11.390 align:middle line:90%
or in the outer world.

00:08:11.390 --> 00:08:14.630 align:middle line:84%
The magnetic field
creates a lag time

00:08:14.630 --> 00:08:18.020 align:middle line:84%
that gives us the
opportunity to really think

00:08:18.020 --> 00:08:20.780 align:middle line:84%
about the choices we
make, about the emotions

00:08:20.780 --> 00:08:24.290 align:middle line:84%
that we're creating,
to hone those choices

00:08:24.290 --> 00:08:29.130 align:middle line:84%
before they become a reality
in our world and in our bodies.

00:08:29.130 --> 00:08:31.100 align:middle line:90%
So it suggests that maybe--

00:08:31.100 --> 00:08:34.080 align:middle line:84%
maybe-- we're going
find ourselves

00:08:34.080 --> 00:08:38.580 align:middle line:84%
at some future time in a world
where that magnetic field is

00:08:38.580 --> 00:08:42.240 align:middle line:84%
not so strong, where our
choices become reality almost

00:08:42.240 --> 00:08:45.180 align:middle line:84%
instantaneously; where our
thoughts, feelings, emotions,

00:08:45.180 --> 00:08:48.609 align:middle line:84%
and beliefs manifest
almost immediately.

00:08:48.609 --> 00:08:50.400 align:middle line:84%
And if that's the case,
it would make sense

00:08:50.400 --> 00:08:54.630 align:middle line:84%
that we're learning to master
the consequences of our choices

00:08:54.630 --> 00:08:58.300 align:middle line:84%
now, in this world, in a
relatively safe environment.

00:08:58.300 --> 00:09:03.210 align:middle line:84%
Can you imagine what would your
life look like if every fantasy

00:09:03.210 --> 00:09:05.760 align:middle line:84%
that you have; if every
passing thought, feeling,

00:09:05.760 --> 00:09:08.310 align:middle line:84%
and emotion suddenly
became manifest?

00:09:08.310 --> 00:09:10.440 align:middle line:84%
I think you can agree
that all of our lives

00:09:10.440 --> 00:09:12.840 align:middle line:84%
would look very different
than they look today.

00:09:12.840 --> 00:09:17.430 align:middle line:84%
So this relationship
between the biology

00:09:17.430 --> 00:09:19.740 align:middle line:84%
of our bodies and
the physical world

00:09:19.740 --> 00:09:22.680 align:middle line:84%
strongly suggests that whatever
it is that we're learning

00:09:22.680 --> 00:09:27.810 align:middle line:84%
has to do with our mastery
of our inner technology

00:09:27.810 --> 00:09:31.590 align:middle line:84%
and its relationship
to the world around us.

00:09:31.590 --> 00:09:34.850 align:middle line:84%
So these relationships
make even more sense

00:09:34.850 --> 00:09:37.970 align:middle line:84%
when we begin to consider
them within the context

00:09:37.970 --> 00:09:42.370 align:middle line:84%
of the mystical teachings of the
past, the spiritual traditions

00:09:42.370 --> 00:09:47.060 align:middle line:84%
that have always told us that
there is a power within us

00:09:47.060 --> 00:09:50.630 align:middle line:84%
to change the conditions
not only of our bodies,

00:09:50.630 --> 00:09:53.520 align:middle line:84%
but of our relationship
to the physical world.

00:09:53.520 --> 00:09:57.560 align:middle line:84%
And it's these abilities,
this human potential,

00:09:57.560 --> 00:10:00.290 align:middle line:84%
that has been the
core of the mysteries

00:10:00.290 --> 00:10:03.680 align:middle line:84%
and the secrets that were
preserved in the monasteries,

00:10:03.680 --> 00:10:05.210 align:middle line:84%
in the nunneries,
in the teachings

00:10:05.210 --> 00:10:08.690 align:middle line:84%
of the shamans and the
healers and the curanderos

00:10:08.690 --> 00:10:10.170 align:middle line:90%
throughout the world.

00:10:10.170 --> 00:10:13.340 align:middle line:10%
I've had the opportunity
to experience

00:10:13.340 --> 00:10:16.010 align:middle line:10%
precisely these kinds
of teachings personally,

00:10:16.010 --> 00:10:17.750 align:middle line:10%
and I'd like to take
just a few moments

00:10:17.750 --> 00:10:20.540 align:middle line:10%
to share with you an
example of exactly what it

00:10:20.540 --> 00:10:23.780 align:middle line:10%
is that I mean here.

00:10:23.780 --> 00:10:27.890 align:middle line:84%
In the 1990s, I had a
number of opportunities

00:10:27.890 --> 00:10:30.530 align:middle line:84%
to visit the monasteries
and nunneries

00:10:30.530 --> 00:10:33.840 align:middle line:84%
in the highlands of central
China on the Tibetan Plateau.

00:10:33.840 --> 00:10:37.580 align:middle line:84%
And at that time, Tibet
was very accessible to me.

00:10:37.580 --> 00:10:40.280 align:middle line:84%
12 monasteries and
two nunneries and some

00:10:40.280 --> 00:10:43.820 align:middle line:84%
of the most mystical
caves of the yogis

00:10:43.820 --> 00:10:46.190 align:middle line:84%
preserving the wisdom and
the teachings of those

00:10:46.190 --> 00:10:48.330 align:middle line:90%
who have come before us.

00:10:48.330 --> 00:10:53.030 align:middle line:84%
So it was in these places
where I had the opportunity

00:10:53.030 --> 00:10:57.840 align:middle line:84%
to see something that I have
studied since my childhood.

00:10:57.840 --> 00:11:02.570 align:middle line:84%
It is the dwelling of an
ancient yogi, a mystical yogi.

00:11:02.570 --> 00:11:03.840 align:middle line:90%
His name was Milarepa.

00:11:03.840 --> 00:11:06.920 align:middle line:84%
His full name was
Jetsun Milarepa.

00:11:06.920 --> 00:11:11.180 align:middle line:84%
And he lived between
the years 1052 and 1135.

00:11:11.180 --> 00:11:13.630 align:middle line:84%
Let me tell you a little
bit about Milarepa's life

00:11:13.630 --> 00:11:15.830 align:middle line:84%
and it will help to
understand what it is

00:11:15.830 --> 00:11:18.040 align:middle line:90%
that he left in his teaching.

00:11:18.040 --> 00:11:21.740 align:middle line:84%
Milarepa came from
a privileged family.

00:11:21.740 --> 00:11:25.880 align:middle line:84%
His parents were wealthy,
his life was relatively easy.

00:11:25.880 --> 00:11:29.960 align:middle line:84%
He studied the mystical arts
because he had the opportunity

00:11:29.960 --> 00:11:32.510 align:middle line:90%
to do precisely that.

00:11:32.510 --> 00:11:35.510 align:middle line:84%
And it was during
his youth that there

00:11:35.510 --> 00:11:40.730 align:middle line:84%
was a battle between his village
and a neighboring village.

00:11:40.730 --> 00:11:46.070 align:middle line:84%
And his entire family was
killed in this battle.

00:11:46.070 --> 00:11:48.710 align:middle line:84%
His village was destroyed,
all of his friends,

00:11:48.710 --> 00:11:52.010 align:middle line:84%
his neighbors, everyone that
he had known were killed.

00:11:52.010 --> 00:11:56.000 align:middle line:84%
And he survived and became
enraged from within.

00:11:56.000 --> 00:12:00.260 align:middle line:84%
And he channeled his
rage into revenge.

00:12:00.260 --> 00:12:06.320 align:middle line:84%
He used what he knew of the
mystical arts to exact revenge

00:12:06.320 --> 00:12:09.590 align:middle line:84%
upon those who had taken the
lives of everyone that he knew.

00:12:09.590 --> 00:12:12.560 align:middle line:84%
He went and he took
many lives himself.

00:12:12.560 --> 00:12:14.600 align:middle line:84%
He killed the people
responsible for killing

00:12:14.600 --> 00:12:17.810 align:middle line:84%
his family, killed the people
responsible for destroying

00:12:17.810 --> 00:12:19.070 align:middle line:90%
his village.

00:12:19.070 --> 00:12:22.310 align:middle line:84%
And immediately, he knew
that what he had done

00:12:22.310 --> 00:12:25.910 align:middle line:84%
was not honoring the
mystical teachings as they

00:12:25.910 --> 00:12:29.780 align:middle line:84%
had been shared with him and he
felt very remorseful for what

00:12:29.780 --> 00:12:30.790 align:middle line:90%
he had done.

00:12:30.790 --> 00:12:34.130 align:middle line:84%
It was in that moment
that Milarepa renounced

00:12:34.130 --> 00:12:36.270 align:middle line:90%
his physical possessions.

00:12:36.270 --> 00:12:38.960 align:middle line:84%
He left the world
of comfort and he

00:12:38.960 --> 00:12:43.040 align:middle line:84%
went to a cave high in
the mountains of Tibet

00:12:43.040 --> 00:12:46.970 align:middle line:84%
to reconcile his
emotions, the guilt

00:12:46.970 --> 00:12:51.950 align:middle line:84%
that he felt for taking so
many human lives in retribution

00:12:51.950 --> 00:12:55.160 align:middle line:84%
for the loss of his
family and his loved ones.

00:12:55.160 --> 00:13:01.280 align:middle line:84%
He vowed in that moment to
stay in a cave of seclusion

00:13:01.280 --> 00:13:03.350 align:middle line:84%
and to spend the
rest of his life

00:13:03.350 --> 00:13:07.700 align:middle line:84%
honing his skills
only for good things.

00:13:07.700 --> 00:13:12.710 align:middle line:84%
He would no longer use his
abilities to hurt other people.

00:13:12.710 --> 00:13:14.420 align:middle line:84%
For the rest of
his life, Milarepa

00:13:14.420 --> 00:13:19.760 align:middle line:84%
lived in a series of caves
high in the Tibetan Plateau.

00:13:19.760 --> 00:13:22.940 align:middle line:84%
And the writings of those
who had the opportunity

00:13:22.940 --> 00:13:25.910 align:middle line:84%
to spend time with him
describe his condition

00:13:25.910 --> 00:13:27.140 align:middle line:90%
in very graphic terms.

00:13:27.140 --> 00:13:32.900 align:middle line:84%
They say he ate only the nettles
that grew near the caves.

00:13:32.900 --> 00:13:35.060 align:middle line:84%
They were very high
and chlorophyll.

00:13:35.060 --> 00:13:40.850 align:middle line:84%
The diet of 100% chlorophyll
turned his body green.

00:13:40.850 --> 00:13:45.020 align:middle line:84%
His skin turned green,
his hair turned green.

00:13:45.020 --> 00:13:48.860 align:middle line:84%
His clothing became
tattered and his hair

00:13:48.860 --> 00:13:50.360 align:middle line:90%
grew down to his waist.

00:13:50.360 --> 00:13:52.730 align:middle line:84%
And they say he was a
very frightening sight

00:13:52.730 --> 00:13:57.080 align:middle line:84%
to see this man with green
skin, green teeth, green hair,

00:13:57.080 --> 00:14:00.350 align:middle line:84%
and tattered clothing come
to the mouth of the cave

00:14:00.350 --> 00:14:02.670 align:middle line:90%
when visitors would go there.

00:14:02.670 --> 00:14:04.760 align:middle line:84%
But the point that
the story is this,

00:14:04.760 --> 00:14:10.160 align:middle line:84%
Milarepa mastered his inner
potential and the ability

00:14:10.160 --> 00:14:11.840 align:middle line:90%
to use it for good things.

00:14:11.840 --> 00:14:13.280 align:middle line:84%
And there were
students that would

00:14:13.280 --> 00:14:18.290 align:middle line:84%
come to him who wanted to learn
what it is that he had learned.

00:14:18.290 --> 00:14:21.440 align:middle line:84%
And Milarepa would use the
opportunity of this cave

00:14:21.440 --> 00:14:24.440 align:middle line:84%
to demonstrate something
for his students

00:14:24.440 --> 00:14:27.710 align:middle line:84%
that has great relevance in
what we're talking about here.

00:14:27.710 --> 00:14:31.370 align:middle line:10%
When pilgrims visit
Milarepa's cave today,

00:14:31.370 --> 00:14:34.010 align:middle line:10%
they see the remnants
of his teachings

00:14:34.010 --> 00:14:37.970 align:middle line:10%
that he offered to his students
and they see the remnants

00:14:37.970 --> 00:14:41.420 align:middle line:10%
on the ceiling of the cave
walls just as you're seeing

00:14:41.420 --> 00:14:42.810 align:middle line:10%
on your screen right now.

00:14:42.810 --> 00:14:45.260 align:middle line:84%
There are pilgrims
that come to pay homage

00:14:45.260 --> 00:14:49.400 align:middle line:84%
to Milarepa's teaching, but
there are students who come

00:14:49.400 --> 00:14:51.440 align:middle line:84%
and they literally
will place their hands

00:14:51.440 --> 00:14:54.230 align:middle line:84%
at very specific
places on the walls

00:14:54.230 --> 00:14:55.640 align:middle line:90%
and on the ceilings of the cave.

00:14:55.640 --> 00:14:57.740 align:middle line:90%
These are not random places.

00:14:57.740 --> 00:14:59.740 align:middle line:84%
Because what they
are doing is they

00:14:59.740 --> 00:15:04.300 align:middle line:84%
are placing their hands
precisely in the place

00:15:04.300 --> 00:15:06.380 align:middle line:90%
that Milarepa placed his.

00:15:06.380 --> 00:15:08.400 align:middle line:90%
Here's the reason why.

00:15:08.400 --> 00:15:11.360 align:middle line:84%
What Milarepa demonstrated
for his students

00:15:11.360 --> 00:15:15.170 align:middle line:84%
was that he would place his
hand against the physical wall

00:15:15.170 --> 00:15:16.060 align:middle line:90%
of the cave.

00:15:16.060 --> 00:15:19.970 align:middle line:84%
He would close his eyes,
take a deep breath.

00:15:19.970 --> 00:15:22.950 align:middle line:84%
He would create an
inner experience

00:15:22.950 --> 00:15:27.310 align:middle line:84%
within his body that
changed his relationship

00:15:27.310 --> 00:15:29.260 align:middle line:90%
with his physical world.

00:15:29.260 --> 00:15:33.730 align:middle line:84%
And to demonstrate that, as he
touched the rock of the cave,

00:15:33.730 --> 00:15:36.280 align:middle line:84%
he would continue
to press his hand

00:15:36.280 --> 00:15:39.190 align:middle line:84%
and his hand would
continue to move

00:15:39.190 --> 00:15:44.000 align:middle line:84%
into the ceiling of the cave
as if the rock did not exist.

00:15:44.000 --> 00:15:46.300 align:middle line:84%
What Milarepa was
doing was transcending

00:15:46.300 --> 00:15:49.090 align:middle line:84%
the limits of his
physical reality,

00:15:49.090 --> 00:15:51.250 align:middle line:84%
and he was doing
it by regulating

00:15:51.250 --> 00:15:53.980 align:middle line:90%
his inner technology.

00:15:53.980 --> 00:16:00.070 align:middle line:84%
When he felt the feelings, when
he created this inner condition

00:16:00.070 --> 00:16:04.870 align:middle line:84%
of being able to move his
hand through that rock,

00:16:04.870 --> 00:16:08.230 align:middle line:84%
the walls of the cave
were no longer boundaries

00:16:08.230 --> 00:16:09.700 align:middle line:90%
to his experience.

00:16:09.700 --> 00:16:14.530 align:middle line:84%
He was no longer limited by
the physical walls of the cave.

00:16:14.530 --> 00:16:18.850 align:middle line:84%
And as he demonstrated
this for his students,

00:16:18.850 --> 00:16:22.210 align:middle line:84%
what he showed his students
was that they are only

00:16:22.210 --> 00:16:24.580 align:middle line:90%
limited in their lives.

00:16:24.580 --> 00:16:27.670 align:middle line:84%
They're only bound in
their physical world

00:16:27.670 --> 00:16:31.690 align:middle line:84%
as long as their beliefs
create that boundary.

00:16:31.690 --> 00:16:36.160 align:middle line:84%
And by seeing Milarepa
transcend these limits,

00:16:36.160 --> 00:16:39.970 align:middle line:84%
it freed the inner
beliefs of his students

00:16:39.970 --> 00:16:42.000 align:middle line:90%
to do the same for themselves.

00:16:42.000 --> 00:16:44.260 align:middle line:84%
And I want you to
know the reason why.

00:16:44.260 --> 00:16:48.100 align:middle line:84%
It's because this ties
precisely into what we're

00:16:48.100 --> 00:16:50.770 align:middle line:90%
learning in our simulation.

00:16:50.770 --> 00:16:53.560 align:middle line:84%
How do we relate to
the laws of physics?

00:16:53.560 --> 00:16:56.770 align:middle line:84%
How do we relate to the laws
of our physical reality?

00:16:56.770 --> 00:17:02.890 align:middle line:84%
What is our inner potential to
actually transcend the limits

00:17:02.890 --> 00:17:05.650 align:middle line:84%
that we perceive in our
world and what might that

00:17:05.650 --> 00:17:07.240 align:middle line:84%
mean in the world
that we're going

00:17:07.240 --> 00:17:11.377 align:middle line:84%
to as we learn of our greatest
potential in this simulation?

00:17:11.377 --> 00:17:18.069 align:middle line:90%


00:17:18.069 --> 00:17:22.720 align:middle line:84%
So when we think about what
Milarepa showed his students

00:17:22.720 --> 00:17:24.990 align:middle line:84%
on the walls of
that cave, I want

00:17:24.990 --> 00:17:27.190 align:middle line:84%
to tell you I went
there myself personally

00:17:27.190 --> 00:17:30.920 align:middle line:84%
because I wanted to see the
legacy that Milarepa had left.

00:17:30.920 --> 00:17:34.410 align:middle line:84%
I physically placed my
hands into the impressions

00:17:34.410 --> 00:17:38.040 align:middle line:84%
that he left, multiple
impressions, in that cave wall.

00:17:38.040 --> 00:17:40.830 align:middle line:84%
Some of them came all
the way up to my mid-arm.

00:17:40.830 --> 00:17:44.090 align:middle line:84%
And my hands fit perfectly
into those imprints.

00:17:44.090 --> 00:17:46.170 align:middle line:84%
I'm absolutely certain
that this is not a hoax,

00:17:46.170 --> 00:17:50.610 align:middle line:84%
that this rock actually changed
its consistency in the presence

00:17:50.610 --> 00:17:53.850 align:middle line:84%
of this man's physical body
as a result of something

00:17:53.850 --> 00:17:57.280 align:middle line:90%
that he changed within himself.

00:17:57.280 --> 00:18:00.150 align:middle line:84%
So when we see something
like this, the question is,

00:18:00.150 --> 00:18:04.090 align:middle line:84%
is it a miracle or
is it a technology?

00:18:04.090 --> 00:18:05.700 align:middle line:84%
Well, the answer
to this question

00:18:05.700 --> 00:18:08.820 align:middle line:84%
depends upon you and how
you think of yourself.

00:18:08.820 --> 00:18:10.590 align:middle line:90%
What is your story?

00:18:10.590 --> 00:18:13.890 align:middle line:84%
What is your story that you
tell yourself and believe

00:18:13.890 --> 00:18:16.380 align:middle line:84%
about your relationship
to the world?

00:18:16.380 --> 00:18:20.340 align:middle line:84%
Do you believe that you are
limited in your experience,

00:18:20.340 --> 00:18:24.030 align:middle line:84%
that you live in a world
of separation, competition,

00:18:24.030 --> 00:18:27.374 align:middle line:84%
conflict where you are separate
from your physical reality,

00:18:27.374 --> 00:18:29.040 align:middle line:84%
where you're separate
from your own body

00:18:29.040 --> 00:18:31.860 align:middle line:84%
and powerless over
any circumstances

00:18:31.860 --> 00:18:33.160 align:middle line:90%
or conditions in your life?

00:18:33.160 --> 00:18:37.830 align:middle line:84%
Or do you believe that you live
in a world that is connected,

00:18:37.830 --> 00:18:39.720 align:middle line:84%
that is unified,
that you are part of

00:18:39.720 --> 00:18:42.750 align:middle line:84%
rather than separate from
the world that you see

00:18:42.750 --> 00:18:46.110 align:middle line:84%
and because of that, as
you change in yourself

00:18:46.110 --> 00:18:49.680 align:middle line:84%
from within that you can full
well expect those changes to be

00:18:49.680 --> 00:18:52.920 align:middle line:84%
reflected and mirrored
in your physical reality

00:18:52.920 --> 00:18:54.790 align:middle line:90%
in the world around you?

00:18:54.790 --> 00:18:56.640 align:middle line:84%
Well, your answer
to the question

00:18:56.640 --> 00:18:58.710 align:middle line:84%
determines the
answer as to whether

00:18:58.710 --> 00:19:00.930 align:middle line:84%
or not what Milarepa
showed us is

00:19:00.930 --> 00:19:03.930 align:middle line:84%
a miracle or a
technology helping

00:19:03.930 --> 00:19:09.030 align:middle line:84%
us to remember the potential
that lives within each of us.

00:19:09.030 --> 00:19:11.400 align:middle line:84%
Well, our own science
now is beginning

00:19:11.400 --> 00:19:14.550 align:middle line:84%
to reveal relationships
within our bodies

00:19:14.550 --> 00:19:17.430 align:middle line:84%
in just the last
few years that help

00:19:17.430 --> 00:19:20.640 align:middle line:84%
us to give credence to
what Milarepa showed us.

00:19:20.640 --> 00:19:24.210 align:middle line:84%
I want to share two recent
discoveries with you.

00:19:24.210 --> 00:19:27.180 align:middle line:84%
These discoveries are
so recent they're rarely

00:19:27.180 --> 00:19:31.470 align:middle line:84%
taught in textbooks and in the
classrooms on the one hand.

00:19:31.470 --> 00:19:35.040 align:middle line:84%
And on the other hand, they are
based in peer-reviewed science

00:19:35.040 --> 00:19:38.040 align:middle line:84%
and they tell us
something about ourselves,

00:19:38.040 --> 00:19:40.410 align:middle line:84%
and that something
changes the way

00:19:40.410 --> 00:19:43.770 align:middle line:84%
we think of ourselves and our
relationship to the world.

00:19:43.770 --> 00:19:45.480 align:middle line:84%
Now, the first of
these discoveries I

00:19:45.480 --> 00:19:49.110 align:middle line:84%
talked about in greater detail
in the first season of "Missing

00:19:49.110 --> 00:19:50.340 align:middle line:90%
Links."

00:19:50.340 --> 00:19:56.160 align:middle line:84%
In 1991, scientists discovered
approximately 40,000

00:19:56.160 --> 00:20:00.300 align:middle line:84%
specialized cells concentrated
within every human heart

00:20:00.300 --> 00:20:04.110 align:middle line:84%
in a way that simply had not
been recognized previously.

00:20:04.110 --> 00:20:07.020 align:middle line:84%
They're called sensory
neurites, which

00:20:07.020 --> 00:20:09.120 align:middle line:84%
is a little bit of a
technical-sounding word.

00:20:09.120 --> 00:20:11.280 align:middle line:84%
They're essentially
brain-like cells,

00:20:11.280 --> 00:20:13.900 align:middle line:84%
but they're not in the
brain, they're in the heart.

00:20:13.900 --> 00:20:15.750 align:middle line:84%
They are concentrated
in such a way

00:20:15.750 --> 00:20:19.050 align:middle line:84%
that they're actually called
the little brain in the heart.

00:20:19.050 --> 00:20:23.157 align:middle line:84%
And these cells literally
think independently

00:20:23.157 --> 00:20:24.240 align:middle line:90%
of the cells in our brain.

00:20:24.240 --> 00:20:27.480 align:middle line:84%
They feel and they
remember independently

00:20:27.480 --> 00:20:30.010 align:middle line:90%
of the neurons in our brain.

00:20:30.010 --> 00:20:33.720 align:middle line:84%
So what we're talking about are
two separate organs, the brain

00:20:33.720 --> 00:20:35.080 align:middle line:90%
and the heart.

00:20:35.080 --> 00:20:39.300 align:middle line:84%
However, we also know that
there is the potential

00:20:39.300 --> 00:20:42.090 align:middle line:84%
to harmonize the
heart and the brain

00:20:42.090 --> 00:20:46.320 align:middle line:84%
into a single potent system,
to harmonize the heart

00:20:46.320 --> 00:20:50.190 align:middle line:84%
and the brain through what we
call heart-brain coherence.

00:20:50.190 --> 00:20:54.900 align:middle line:84%
And when we do that, we change
our relationship to our bodies,

00:20:54.900 --> 00:20:58.680 align:middle line:84%
we change our relationship
to our physical world.

00:20:58.680 --> 00:21:02.490 align:middle line:84%
For example, when we harmonize
the heart and the brain,

00:21:02.490 --> 00:21:06.660 align:middle line:84%
we open the doorway
to self-regulation

00:21:06.660 --> 00:21:10.620 align:middle line:84%
of some of the most mystical
systems within the human body.

00:21:10.620 --> 00:21:13.260 align:middle line:84%
We open the door to
the self-regulation

00:21:13.260 --> 00:21:18.210 align:middle line:84%
of deep intuition, for example,
on demand, deep intuition when

00:21:18.210 --> 00:21:22.110 align:middle line:84%
we choose to have it, rather
than waiting for the universe

00:21:22.110 --> 00:21:26.927 align:middle line:84%
to simply surprise us
with spontaneous intuition

00:21:26.927 --> 00:21:28.260 align:middle line:90%
at different times in our lives.

00:21:28.260 --> 00:21:31.380 align:middle line:84%
We've all experienced
spontaneous intuition.

00:21:31.380 --> 00:21:33.810 align:middle line:84%
When you pick up the
telephone to call someone

00:21:33.810 --> 00:21:36.030 align:middle line:84%
that you care about and
they're already on the phone

00:21:36.030 --> 00:21:38.130 align:middle line:84%
before you dial
that number, that's

00:21:38.130 --> 00:21:40.570 align:middle line:84%
an example of
spontaneous intuition.

00:21:40.570 --> 00:21:42.570 align:middle line:84%
You had that
experience, and I know

00:21:42.570 --> 00:21:44.440 align:middle line:84%
we've all had this
from time to time,

00:21:44.440 --> 00:21:47.400 align:middle line:84%
and we say, that was really
interesting, that was cool.

00:21:47.400 --> 00:21:48.930 align:middle line:90%
Can I do it again?

00:21:48.930 --> 00:21:50.550 align:middle line:90%
Can I do it again?

00:21:50.550 --> 00:21:51.810 align:middle line:90%
This is the key.

00:21:51.810 --> 00:21:54.480 align:middle line:84%
Can I do it again because
I choose to do it,

00:21:54.480 --> 00:21:58.650 align:middle line:84%
or must I wait for the
universe to simply give me

00:21:58.650 --> 00:22:00.510 align:middle line:84%
that experience
whenever it happens

00:22:00.510 --> 00:22:02.400 align:middle line:90%
to give me the experience?

00:22:02.400 --> 00:22:04.590 align:middle line:84%
Well, the answer
to that question

00:22:04.590 --> 00:22:07.800 align:middle line:84%
hinges upon our ability to
self-regulate our intuition.

00:22:07.800 --> 00:22:09.570 align:middle line:84%
We pick up that
phone to call someone

00:22:09.570 --> 00:22:12.870 align:middle line:84%
and they're already there,
that is a form of intuition.

00:22:12.870 --> 00:22:17.890 align:middle line:84%
We had an inner sense to walk
over, pick up that receiver--

00:22:17.890 --> 00:22:21.790 align:middle line:84%
or cell phone these days--
and dial that number.

00:22:21.790 --> 00:22:25.910 align:middle line:84%
We had the intuition
possibly subconsciously

00:22:25.910 --> 00:22:27.670 align:middle line:90%
and we followed it.

00:22:27.670 --> 00:22:32.890 align:middle line:84%
If we had consciously
chosen to do the same thing,

00:22:32.890 --> 00:22:34.840 align:middle line:84%
we probably would never
make that connection

00:22:34.840 --> 00:22:38.274 align:middle line:84%
because the intuition is what
connects us with other people.

00:22:38.274 --> 00:22:39.940 align:middle line:84%
So we harmonize the
heart and the brain,

00:22:39.940 --> 00:22:43.540 align:middle line:84%
we open the door to deep
intuition on demand,

00:22:43.540 --> 00:22:47.050 align:middle line:84%
when we choose because we
choose to have that experience.

00:22:47.050 --> 00:22:50.200 align:middle line:84%
We open the door to
deep experiences,

00:22:50.200 --> 00:22:52.630 align:middle line:84%
direct access to the
subconscious, for example.

00:22:52.630 --> 00:22:54.460 align:middle line:84%
We harmonize the
heart and the brain.

00:22:54.460 --> 00:22:56.680 align:middle line:84%
That's a hotline to
the subconscious,

00:22:56.680 --> 00:23:00.550 align:middle line:84%
and that's important to you
and to me for this reason--

00:23:00.550 --> 00:23:05.440 align:middle line:84%
if we ever choose to
change an unhealthy pattern

00:23:05.440 --> 00:23:08.260 align:middle line:84%
from our childhood,
from our parents,

00:23:08.260 --> 00:23:10.690 align:middle line:84%
from our caregivers
when we were young,

00:23:10.690 --> 00:23:13.540 align:middle line:84%
those deeply embedded
subconscious patterns,

00:23:13.540 --> 00:23:17.050 align:middle line:84%
we must communicate with the
subconscious in a language

00:23:17.050 --> 00:23:18.340 align:middle line:90%
that it recognizes.

00:23:18.340 --> 00:23:21.400 align:middle line:84%
It's not enough to say
a verbal affirmation

00:23:21.400 --> 00:23:24.970 align:middle line:84%
a million times if the
subconscious does not

00:23:24.970 --> 00:23:26.740 align:middle line:90%
register that affirmation.

00:23:26.740 --> 00:23:28.240 align:middle line:84%
Harmonizing the
heart and the brain,

00:23:28.240 --> 00:23:31.600 align:middle line:84%
it's a hotline directly
to the subconscious.

00:23:31.600 --> 00:23:35.170 align:middle line:84%
Extraordinary states of
super learning, precognition,

00:23:35.170 --> 00:23:37.420 align:middle line:84%
knowing when things are going
to happen before they're

00:23:37.420 --> 00:23:39.466 align:middle line:84%
happening-- these
are all examples

00:23:39.466 --> 00:23:40.840 align:middle line:84%
of what happens
when we harmonize

00:23:40.840 --> 00:23:42.610 align:middle line:90%
the heart and the brain.

00:23:42.610 --> 00:23:46.300 align:middle line:84%
So it's through these
experiences of self-regulation,

00:23:46.300 --> 00:23:48.970 align:middle line:84%
choosing to harmonize
the heart and the brain,

00:23:48.970 --> 00:23:51.670 align:middle line:84%
that we trigger these
states, as well as

00:23:51.670 --> 00:23:53.950 align:middle line:90%
extraordinary states of health.

00:23:53.950 --> 00:23:56.750 align:middle line:84%
When we harmonize the
heart and the brain,

00:23:56.750 --> 00:24:01.690 align:middle line:84%
it is a catalyst for over 1,300
positive biochemical reactions

00:24:01.690 --> 00:24:02.980 align:middle line:90%
in your body--

00:24:02.980 --> 00:24:06.100 align:middle line:84%
a powerful immune
response, the release

00:24:06.100 --> 00:24:10.640 align:middle line:84%
of anti-aging enzymes for
extraordinary longevity.

00:24:10.640 --> 00:24:11.740 align:middle line:90%
So it's healthy.

00:24:11.740 --> 00:24:15.160 align:middle line:84%
Even if you're not into
deep intuition or access

00:24:15.160 --> 00:24:17.590 align:middle line:84%
to the subconscious, it's
a really healthy thing

00:24:17.590 --> 00:24:20.830 align:middle line:84%
to do to harmonize the
heart and the brain.

00:24:20.830 --> 00:24:23.650 align:middle line:84%
Resilience to life
stress and life

00:24:23.650 --> 00:24:26.020 align:middle line:90%
change-- our world is changing.

00:24:26.020 --> 00:24:29.070 align:middle line:84%
Your world is changing,
my world is changing.

00:24:29.070 --> 00:24:32.470 align:middle line:84%
We've got to find a way to be
resilient to this tremendous

00:24:32.470 --> 00:24:33.850 align:middle line:90%
amount of change.

00:24:33.850 --> 00:24:38.740 align:middle line:84%
Our bodies can do it if we
tune and harmonize our bodies

00:24:38.740 --> 00:24:39.940 align:middle line:90%
with the world.

00:24:39.940 --> 00:24:44.320 align:middle line:84%
Heart-brain coherence helps
us to do precisely that.

00:24:44.320 --> 00:24:47.020 align:middle line:84%
So this discovery of
these 40,000 neurites

00:24:47.020 --> 00:24:49.360 align:middle line:84%
in the heart and the
ability to harmonize

00:24:49.360 --> 00:24:51.434 align:middle line:84%
the heart and the brain,
it changes everything,

00:24:51.434 --> 00:24:53.350 align:middle line:84%
the way we think about
ourselves and our body,

00:24:53.350 --> 00:24:55.025 align:middle line:84%
and that's just the
first discovery.

00:24:55.025 --> 00:24:59.460 align:middle line:84%
The second discovery, this is
even more fascinating for me.

00:24:59.460 --> 00:25:04.060 align:middle line:84%
It is a discovery that
was made in the year 2004

00:25:04.060 --> 00:25:07.600 align:middle line:84%
by Italian scientists,
and it is the discovery

00:25:07.600 --> 00:25:12.010 align:middle line:84%
of what are called mirror
neurons in the brain,

00:25:12.010 --> 00:25:14.320 align:middle line:90%
in the neocortex of the brain--

00:25:14.320 --> 00:25:16.940 align:middle line:84%
very specific places
in the neocortex

00:25:16.940 --> 00:25:19.510 align:middle line:84%
is where these specialized
cells are found.

00:25:19.510 --> 00:25:21.100 align:middle line:90%
Now, what is a mirror neuron?

00:25:21.100 --> 00:25:22.930 align:middle line:90%
You'll love this.

00:25:22.930 --> 00:25:27.220 align:middle line:84%
A mirror neuron is
a specialized neuron

00:25:27.220 --> 00:25:32.740 align:middle line:84%
that fires both when
we have an experience

00:25:32.740 --> 00:25:36.340 align:middle line:84%
and it also fires when
we witness the experience

00:25:36.340 --> 00:25:39.700 align:middle line:84%
even though we're not really
having the experience.

00:25:39.700 --> 00:25:41.840 align:middle line:90%
Think about what that means.

00:25:41.840 --> 00:25:44.170 align:middle line:84%
It means that when
we watch something--

00:25:44.170 --> 00:25:47.020 align:middle line:84%
this is why sports
is so powerful.

00:25:47.020 --> 00:25:49.250 align:middle line:84%
We can lie on the couch
on a Sunday afternoon

00:25:49.250 --> 00:25:50.890 align:middle line:90%
and watch a football game.

00:25:50.890 --> 00:25:52.000 align:middle line:90%
We're lying down.

00:25:52.000 --> 00:25:55.390 align:middle line:84%
Our hearts are racing, our
bodies may be perspiring,

00:25:55.390 --> 00:25:57.410 align:middle line:90%
we are agitated, we're excited.

00:25:57.410 --> 00:25:59.170 align:middle line:90%
But we're not even moving.

00:25:59.170 --> 00:26:01.450 align:middle line:84%
Because our mirror
neuron does not

00:26:01.450 --> 00:26:03.730 align:middle line:84%
know the difference
between us watching

00:26:03.730 --> 00:26:05.980 align:middle line:90%
and having the experience.

00:26:05.980 --> 00:26:10.026 align:middle line:84%
This plays a very powerful
role in the way we learn.

00:26:10.026 --> 00:26:11.650 align:middle line:84%
And I'm sharing this
with you right now

00:26:11.650 --> 00:26:16.240 align:middle line:84%
because mirror neurons
play a very powerful role

00:26:16.240 --> 00:26:19.690 align:middle line:84%
in what Milarepa was
showing to his students.

00:26:19.690 --> 00:26:24.190 align:middle line:84%
When his students
witnessed him doing

00:26:24.190 --> 00:26:26.890 align:middle line:84%
what was believed
to be impossible,

00:26:26.890 --> 00:26:30.430 align:middle line:84%
their mirror neurons
fired as if they

00:26:30.430 --> 00:26:34.510 align:middle line:84%
were having their experience
and their brain did not

00:26:34.510 --> 00:26:39.770 align:middle line:84%
know the difference between
watching and experiencing.

00:26:39.770 --> 00:26:42.040 align:middle line:90%
This is what frees us.

00:26:42.040 --> 00:26:45.490 align:middle line:84%
When we see a miracle
happen with someone else,

00:26:45.490 --> 00:26:50.350 align:middle line:84%
it frees us to allow that
possibility within ourselves.

00:26:50.350 --> 00:26:54.580 align:middle line:84%
These two discoveries-- 40,000
neurites in the human heart

00:26:54.580 --> 00:26:58.390 align:middle line:84%
and the sensory neurites and
our ability to learn through

00:26:58.390 --> 00:26:59.680 align:middle line:90%
witnessing--

00:26:59.680 --> 00:27:02.380 align:middle line:84%
these two discoveries
together change

00:27:02.380 --> 00:27:05.470 align:middle line:84%
everything we've been led to
believe about our relationship

00:27:05.470 --> 00:27:07.360 align:middle line:90%
to our physical reality.

00:27:07.360 --> 00:27:11.650 align:middle line:84%
And in our simulation in this
virtual world that we live in,

00:27:11.650 --> 00:27:14.110 align:middle line:84%
what could be more
important than learning

00:27:14.110 --> 00:27:17.200 align:middle line:84%
to physically interact
with our world

00:27:17.200 --> 00:27:20.970 align:middle line:84%
on demand, when we choose,
in the way and the time

00:27:20.970 --> 00:27:22.520 align:middle line:90%
that we choose to do so?

00:27:22.520 --> 00:27:23.520 align:middle line:90%
Wow.

00:27:23.520 --> 00:27:26.280 align:middle line:84%
This is an awesome--
an awesome--

00:27:26.280 --> 00:27:29.490 align:middle line:84%
new series of
discoveries that empower

00:27:29.490 --> 00:27:34.450 align:middle line:84%
us to feel that we are part of,
rather than separate from, that

00:27:34.450 --> 00:27:36.720 align:middle line:84%
empowers to
participate, rather than

00:27:36.720 --> 00:27:39.150 align:middle line:84%
be victims, of what
we see happening

00:27:39.150 --> 00:27:41.790 align:middle line:90%
in our lives and our world.

00:27:41.790 --> 00:27:45.510 align:middle line:84%
So with these ideas
in mind, the ideas

00:27:45.510 --> 00:27:49.230 align:middle line:84%
that we are biologically
wired to interact

00:27:49.230 --> 00:27:51.870 align:middle line:84%
with our physical
reality and that we

00:27:51.870 --> 00:27:55.140 align:middle line:84%
can change our physical
reality by changing

00:27:55.140 --> 00:27:58.890 align:middle line:84%
our biology, these two very
powerful ideas in mind,

00:27:58.890 --> 00:28:01.980 align:middle line:84%
let's go back into
one of our most

00:28:01.980 --> 00:28:06.030 align:middle line:84%
cherished and ancient
spiritual traditions,

00:28:06.030 --> 00:28:08.460 align:middle line:84%
a tradition that
was actually edited

00:28:08.460 --> 00:28:12.249 align:middle line:84%
from the modern biblical
canon in the fourth century

00:28:12.249 --> 00:28:14.040 align:middle line:84%
during the time of the
Emperor Constantine,

00:28:14.040 --> 00:28:17.330 align:middle line:84%
when we know over
40 biblical books

00:28:17.330 --> 00:28:20.130 align:middle line:84%
were either completely
taken out or they

00:28:20.130 --> 00:28:22.650 align:middle line:84%
were edited and
rearranged and condensed

00:28:22.650 --> 00:28:26.240 align:middle line:84%
into what we know as the modern
Bible, today the New Testament.

00:28:26.240 --> 00:28:31.980 align:middle line:84%
And what we find is that the
instructions for us relating

00:28:31.980 --> 00:28:34.110 align:middle line:84%
to our physical
reality in just the way

00:28:34.110 --> 00:28:37.260 align:middle line:84%
that I've described to
you were left for us

00:28:37.260 --> 00:28:39.420 align:middle line:84%
in this ancient
text before it was

00:28:39.420 --> 00:28:42.240 align:middle line:90%
edited in the fourth century.

00:28:42.240 --> 00:28:45.030 align:middle line:84%
In the fourth century,
the Emperor Constantine

00:28:45.030 --> 00:28:48.180 align:middle line:84%
held a council, the
Council of Nicea.

00:28:48.180 --> 00:28:50.340 align:middle line:84%
And in that council,
there was an effort

00:28:50.340 --> 00:28:56.700 align:middle line:84%
to streamline and modernize what
was then a collection of texts.

00:28:56.700 --> 00:28:59.490 align:middle line:84%
And among the texts
that were edited

00:28:59.490 --> 00:29:05.250 align:middle line:84%
was a biblical book that is
called the Gospel of Thomas.

00:29:05.250 --> 00:29:08.670 align:middle line:84%
Now, we know about
these books because they

00:29:08.670 --> 00:29:12.790 align:middle line:84%
have been rediscovered
in the mid-20th century

00:29:12.790 --> 00:29:15.720 align:middle line:84%
in a little village in
Egypt along the Nile River.

00:29:15.720 --> 00:29:19.440 align:middle line:10%
The name of the village
is called Nag Hammadi.

00:29:19.440 --> 00:29:24.420 align:middle line:10%
And the collection of texts
are now called the Nag Hammadi

00:29:24.420 --> 00:29:27.810 align:middle line:10%
texts, the Nag Hammadi library.

00:29:27.810 --> 00:29:30.390 align:middle line:84%
And it is in this
Nag Hammadi library

00:29:30.390 --> 00:29:32.790 align:middle line:84%
that we find the original
versions of the texts that

00:29:32.790 --> 00:29:37.200 align:middle line:84%
were edited and that's how we
know that they were taken away.

00:29:37.200 --> 00:29:40.710 align:middle line:84%
In the Gospel of Thomas,
there is a very, very precise

00:29:40.710 --> 00:29:41.510 align:middle line:90%
passage.

00:29:41.510 --> 00:29:45.720 align:middle line:84%
And it is also reflected in
the authorized King James

00:29:45.720 --> 00:29:47.800 align:middle line:90%
version of the Book of John.

00:29:47.800 --> 00:29:53.220 align:middle line:84%
So if you're looking at the
modern Bible, John 16:23-24.

00:29:53.220 --> 00:29:57.210 align:middle line:84%
And I know you're familiar with
this text, the edited version

00:29:57.210 --> 00:30:00.450 align:middle line:84%
that was lost in the translation
where the original meaning was

00:30:00.450 --> 00:30:01.440 align:middle line:90%
lost.

00:30:01.440 --> 00:30:03.720 align:middle line:84%
You've all heard
this before, ask

00:30:03.720 --> 00:30:07.740 align:middle line:84%
and he shall receive that
your joy may be full.

00:30:07.740 --> 00:30:09.720 align:middle line:10%
I heard that when I was a kid.

00:30:09.720 --> 00:30:12.279 align:middle line:10%
People around me said, I
ask and ask all the time

00:30:12.279 --> 00:30:13.320 align:middle line:10%
and nothing ever happens.

00:30:13.320 --> 00:30:14.670 align:middle line:90%
Why is that?

00:30:14.670 --> 00:30:16.830 align:middle line:84%
Well, if this is true
for you, the answer

00:30:16.830 --> 00:30:23.130 align:middle line:84%
may be because we received
in our biblical traditions

00:30:23.130 --> 00:30:25.680 align:middle line:90%
the condensed version.

00:30:25.680 --> 00:30:27.840 align:middle line:84%
And you've heard the
phrase that something

00:30:27.840 --> 00:30:29.460 align:middle line:84%
is lost in
translation, and that's

00:30:29.460 --> 00:30:31.800 align:middle line:84%
precisely what
happened in this text.

00:30:31.800 --> 00:30:36.830 align:middle line:10%
If we go back to the original
Aramaic text before the edits,

00:30:36.830 --> 00:30:40.180 align:middle line:10%
it reads similar but
with key differences.

00:30:40.180 --> 00:30:42.000 align:middle line:10%
Here's what I mean.

00:30:42.000 --> 00:30:44.490 align:middle line:84%
In the original
texts, the Aramaic

00:30:44.490 --> 00:30:48.600 align:middle line:84%
translates to ask
without hidden motive

00:30:48.600 --> 00:30:52.260 align:middle line:84%
and be surrounded
by your answer,

00:30:52.260 --> 00:30:55.720 align:middle line:90%
be enveloped by what you desire.

00:30:55.720 --> 00:30:58.530 align:middle line:90%
And those are the key words, be.

00:30:58.530 --> 00:31:01.320 align:middle line:84%
If you are being
surrounded by your answer,

00:31:01.320 --> 00:31:03.930 align:middle line:84%
if you are being enveloped
by what you desire,

00:31:03.930 --> 00:31:07.810 align:middle line:84%
it means that you are having
the emotional experience

00:31:07.810 --> 00:31:11.020 align:middle line:84%
as if those things
are already present.

00:31:11.020 --> 00:31:13.800 align:middle line:84%
And this is a very,
very powerful concept.

00:31:13.800 --> 00:31:17.490 align:middle line:84%
There is a huge
difference between working

00:31:17.490 --> 00:31:22.950 align:middle line:84%
toward an outcome and
beginning as if that outcome is

00:31:22.950 --> 00:31:24.030 align:middle line:90%
already present.

00:31:24.030 --> 00:31:25.200 align:middle line:90%
Think about this.

00:31:25.200 --> 00:31:27.120 align:middle line:84%
Think about it for
your own healing,

00:31:27.120 --> 00:31:28.870 align:middle line:84%
think about it for
your own relationships,

00:31:28.870 --> 00:31:32.340 align:middle line:84%
think about it for the
abundance in your life.

00:31:32.340 --> 00:31:34.890 align:middle line:84%
If you are asking for
them to be present,

00:31:34.890 --> 00:31:37.800 align:middle line:84%
it means they are
not present now.

00:31:37.800 --> 00:31:42.390 align:middle line:84%
If you are giving thanks
for what already exists,

00:31:42.390 --> 00:31:46.290 align:middle line:84%
you are claiming that it
is present in this moment.

00:31:46.290 --> 00:31:48.810 align:middle line:84%
You are changing the
biology of your body,

00:31:48.810 --> 00:31:51.240 align:middle line:84%
you are changing the
chemistry of your body

00:31:51.240 --> 00:31:53.850 align:middle line:84%
as it interacts with
your physical environment

00:31:53.850 --> 00:31:56.640 align:middle line:84%
so that that reality
may be present.

00:31:56.640 --> 00:31:59.820 align:middle line:84%
Remember, the field is
a mirror or for what

00:31:59.820 --> 00:32:02.490 align:middle line:90%
we claim to be true within.

00:32:02.490 --> 00:32:07.890 align:middle line:84%
In a simulation, what could be
more powerful than the ability

00:32:07.890 --> 00:32:14.220 align:middle line:84%
to think, feel, and
emote our true desires,

00:32:14.220 --> 00:32:17.420 align:middle line:84%
our true wishes as
if they have already

00:32:17.420 --> 00:32:21.110 align:middle line:84%
happened, rather than asking
for them to come to pass?

00:32:21.110 --> 00:32:24.620 align:middle line:84%
Where did we learn to focus
on what we don't have?

00:32:24.620 --> 00:32:27.980 align:middle line:84%
Where did you learn
to focus on what

00:32:27.980 --> 00:32:31.160 align:middle line:90%
is not present in your life?

00:32:31.160 --> 00:32:32.330 align:middle line:90%
Turn that around.

00:32:32.330 --> 00:32:35.600 align:middle line:84%
Just a little shift
in thinking and you

00:32:35.600 --> 00:32:38.240 align:middle line:84%
are now working with
a quantum principle.

00:32:38.240 --> 00:32:41.850 align:middle line:84%
Quantum thinking begins
with the outcome.

00:32:41.850 --> 00:32:44.820 align:middle line:84%
This is what was left for us in
our most ancient and cherished

00:32:44.820 --> 00:32:46.340 align:middle line:90%
spiritual traditions.

00:32:46.340 --> 00:32:48.470 align:middle line:84%
It's what's taught
in the monasteries,

00:32:48.470 --> 00:32:52.070 align:middle line:84%
in the nunneries, the healers,
the curanderos, the mystics,

00:32:52.070 --> 00:32:53.600 align:middle line:90%
the shamans.

00:32:53.600 --> 00:32:57.460 align:middle line:10%
It's what was left for us
by the yogis in the past,

00:32:57.460 --> 00:32:59.960 align:middle line:10%
it's what Milarepa was
showing to his students.

00:32:59.960 --> 00:33:03.500 align:middle line:10%
And in a simulated
environment, this

00:33:03.500 --> 00:33:06.200 align:middle line:10%
is where you find your
power in interacting

00:33:06.200 --> 00:33:08.240 align:middle line:10%
with that simulation
consciously,

00:33:08.240 --> 00:33:10.520 align:middle line:10%
intentionally, on demand.

00:33:10.520 --> 00:33:12.710 align:middle line:84%
Now that we
understand the secret

00:33:12.710 --> 00:33:14.930 align:middle line:84%
to our relationship
with our own bodies

00:33:14.930 --> 00:33:17.510 align:middle line:84%
and the extraordinary
potential that we

00:33:17.510 --> 00:33:21.470 align:middle line:84%
have to self-regulate, let's
take these understandings

00:33:21.470 --> 00:33:23.810 align:middle line:84%
beyond our bodies,
into the rhythms

00:33:23.810 --> 00:33:27.290 align:middle line:84%
and the cycles of nature
and the world around us.

00:33:27.290 --> 00:33:31.130 align:middle line:84%
In the next episode, we'll
discover the elegant yet simple

00:33:31.130 --> 00:33:35.180 align:middle line:84%
code that forms the patterns
we see all around us

00:33:35.180 --> 00:33:37.250 align:middle line:84%
as nature and everything
in the natural world,

00:33:37.250 --> 00:33:39.290 align:middle line:84%
from rocks and trees
and plants and mountains

00:33:39.290 --> 00:33:43.880 align:middle line:84%
and rivers to the most intimate
relationships in our lives

00:33:43.880 --> 00:33:46.370 align:middle line:84%
and the universe as
we know it today.
