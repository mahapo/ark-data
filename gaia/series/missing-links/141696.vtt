00:00:25.210 --> 00:00:27.190 align:middle line:10%
>>GREGG BRADEN: Hello,
my name's Gregg Braden.

00:00:27.190 --> 00:00:29.410 align:middle line:10%
And I know that if
you're watching me today,

00:00:29.410 --> 00:00:31.600 align:middle line:10%
you have seen the
program "Missing Links."

00:00:31.600 --> 00:00:33.730 align:middle line:84%
And we have a lot of
people that are asking me

00:00:33.730 --> 00:00:35.890 align:middle line:90%
questions behind the scenes.

00:00:35.890 --> 00:00:37.200 align:middle line:90%
What has happened in my life?

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:38.000 align:middle line:90%
What was involved?

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:39.307 align:middle line:90%
What have I found?

00:00:39.307 --> 00:00:41.140 align:middle line:84%
When I was putting that
information together

00:00:41.140 --> 00:00:42.720 align:middle line:84%
and I think you're
probably aware

00:00:42.720 --> 00:00:44.530 align:middle line:84%
it's just the tip of
the iceberg of all

00:00:44.530 --> 00:00:48.920 align:middle line:84%
of the research that went into
putting this series together.

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:50.170 align:middle line:90%
We know our world is changing.

00:00:50.170 --> 00:00:52.760 align:middle line:84%
And I think one of the most
common themes of the questions

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:55.390 align:middle line:84%
that people ask me from all
over the world, every culture,

00:00:55.390 --> 00:00:58.510 align:middle line:84%
every continent that I'm
on, two things, economy,

00:00:58.510 --> 00:01:01.570 align:middle line:84%
self-sustainability-- how do
we bring those into our lives?

00:01:01.570 --> 00:01:03.653 align:middle line:84%
And that's what I want to
talk to you about today.

00:01:03.653 --> 00:01:06.690 align:middle line:90%


00:01:06.690 --> 00:01:10.110 align:middle line:84%
So when I hear questions
coming to me about economy,

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:11.824 align:middle line:84%
one of the first
things that I found

00:01:11.824 --> 00:01:13.740 align:middle line:84%
is that the word itself
means different things

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:15.180 align:middle line:90%
to different people.

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:17.860 align:middle line:84%
Economy for some
people is about money.

00:01:17.860 --> 00:01:19.500 align:middle line:84%
But I want to say,
today, that economy

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:20.970 align:middle line:90%
is much more than money.

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:23.500 align:middle line:84%
It can be about money
but it's more about us.

00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:24.970 align:middle line:90%
It's about people.

00:01:24.970 --> 00:01:28.890 align:middle line:84%
It's about the way we share the
things that we need to sustain

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:30.210 align:middle line:90%
us in our everyday lives.

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:34.910 align:middle line:84%
The way we share food, energy,
medicine, communications,

00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:38.340 align:middle line:84%
the vital things that are
necessary in everyday life.

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:41.640 align:middle line:84%
Those are the things that are
changing in our world today.

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:46.080 align:middle line:84%
We have found ourselves in a
world where much of our economy

00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:48.100 align:middle line:90%
has been centralized.

00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:51.810 align:middle line:84%
And what's changing, now,
in our time of extremes,

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:53.710 align:middle line:90%
is we see the climate change.

00:01:53.710 --> 00:01:57.930 align:middle line:84%
And we see all of the
factors of conflict,

00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:01.440 align:middle line:84%
and we see all the factors of
the financial economy changing.

00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:04.140 align:middle line:84%
All those systems
coming together.

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:06.690 align:middle line:84%
What we're finding is, this
centralized model no longer

00:02:06.690 --> 00:02:08.020 align:middle line:90%
works anymore.

00:02:08.020 --> 00:02:09.870 align:middle line:84%
So when people ask me,
what is it that they

00:02:09.870 --> 00:02:11.280 align:middle line:90%
can do in their own lives?

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:14.710 align:middle line:84%
The answer for me
is very simple.

00:02:14.710 --> 00:02:17.640 align:middle line:90%
The key is a localized economy.

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:20.350 align:middle line:84%
Localized economy,
what does that mean?

00:02:20.350 --> 00:02:25.170 align:middle line:84%
It means living within our
means in a local community

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:28.380 align:middle line:84%
while that community is part of
an even greater community that

00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:30.990 align:middle line:84%
can be a nation,
it can be a planet.

00:02:30.990 --> 00:02:33.150 align:middle line:84%
It means localized
forms of energy.

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:35.310 align:middle line:84%
It means localized
sources of food.

00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:37.290 align:middle line:90%
It means localized businesses.

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:40.680 align:middle line:84%
It means localized
money, localized loans.

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:43.590 align:middle line:84%
These are the things that
are sustainable in a time

00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:45.480 align:middle line:84%
of extremes when
the world is going

00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:49.100 align:middle line:84%
through a time of such
volatility and uncertainty.

00:02:49.100 --> 00:02:54.180 align:middle line:84%
It is the fragile centralized
system that is most at risk.

00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:56.920 align:middle line:84%
And it's this system
that you and I sense.

00:02:56.920 --> 00:02:57.720 align:middle line:90%
We feel it.

00:02:57.720 --> 00:02:59.250 align:middle line:84%
We don't need
someone to tell us.

00:02:59.250 --> 00:03:00.970 align:middle line:90%
We know this system is at risk.

00:03:00.970 --> 00:03:03.810 align:middle line:84%
And this is where a lot
of the fear comes from.

00:03:03.810 --> 00:03:04.680 align:middle line:90%
What if?

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:06.370 align:middle line:90%
What if the banks fail?

00:03:06.370 --> 00:03:08.640 align:middle line:84%
What if the storms
from the climate change

00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:11.790 align:middle line:84%
are so bad that delivery trucks
can't come across the roads

00:03:11.790 --> 00:03:14.200 align:middle line:84%
into the mountain communities
of Colorado and New Mexico?

00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:15.574 align:middle line:84%
Which has just
happened recently.

00:03:15.574 --> 00:03:16.920 align:middle line:90%
These are a real time thing.

00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:19.530 align:middle line:84%
This isn't just a make
believe hypothesis.

00:03:19.530 --> 00:03:20.460 align:middle line:90%
What do we do then?

00:03:20.460 --> 00:03:23.250 align:middle line:84%
And this is where
people get nervous.

00:03:23.250 --> 00:03:25.704 align:middle line:84%
The key here, in
localized living,

00:03:25.704 --> 00:03:27.870 align:middle line:84%
is we don't have to worry
about any of those things.

00:03:27.870 --> 00:03:30.000 align:middle line:84%
Let me just give
you a quick example.

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:33.210 align:middle line:84%
A couple of years ago,
there was a bacteria

00:03:33.210 --> 00:03:36.550 align:middle line:84%
that was found on certain kinds
of fruits, melons, cantaloupes,

00:03:36.550 --> 00:03:39.670 align:middle line:84%
that were being grown in
portions of the Rocky Mountain

00:03:39.670 --> 00:03:40.470 align:middle line:90%
area.

00:03:40.470 --> 00:03:43.800 align:middle line:84%
And they pulled these from
the grocery store shelves.

00:03:43.800 --> 00:03:46.050 align:middle line:84%
They were warning people
not to eat these things.

00:03:46.050 --> 00:03:48.350 align:middle line:84%
They were having the same
problems with lettuces.

00:03:48.350 --> 00:03:50.433 align:middle line:84%
There were having the same
problems with broccoli.

00:03:50.433 --> 00:03:52.710 align:middle line:84%
And there was another
bacterial issue with eggs,

00:03:52.710 --> 00:03:54.287 align:middle line:90%
with fresh eggs.

00:03:54.287 --> 00:03:56.370 align:middle line:84%
I live in the high deserts
of northern New Mexico,

00:03:56.370 --> 00:03:58.620 align:middle line:90%
a rural localized economy.

00:03:58.620 --> 00:04:01.080 align:middle line:84%
We went to our
neighborhood restaurants

00:04:01.080 --> 00:04:02.190 align:middle line:90%
and we had no problem.

00:04:02.190 --> 00:04:04.273 align:middle line:10%
We didn't have to worry
about any of those things,

00:04:04.273 --> 00:04:06.720 align:middle line:10%
because our food came
from about a block away

00:04:06.720 --> 00:04:08.600 align:middle line:10%
from where the restaurant
was, farm to table.

00:04:08.600 --> 00:04:10.350 align:middle line:84%
And I know, many of
you listening to this,

00:04:10.350 --> 00:04:14.100 align:middle line:84%
you're already experiencing
this because it has made sense.

00:04:14.100 --> 00:04:17.940 align:middle line:84%
What I want you to know is that
it's more than a convenience.

00:04:17.940 --> 00:04:21.360 align:middle line:84%
This is the way of sustainable
living in our future.

00:04:21.360 --> 00:04:24.240 align:middle line:84%
And just as the
localized sources of food

00:04:24.240 --> 00:04:28.860 align:middle line:84%
work to help us provide reliable
systems that we can count on,

00:04:28.860 --> 00:04:30.720 align:middle line:84%
the same thing is
true for energy.

00:04:30.720 --> 00:04:34.219 align:middle line:84%
Energy is determined
by environment.

00:04:34.219 --> 00:04:36.510 align:middle line:84%
Not every environment supports
the same kind of energy.

00:04:36.510 --> 00:04:38.520 align:middle line:84%
If your living out West
and you have a lot of sun,

00:04:38.520 --> 00:04:39.750 align:middle line:90%
solar makes tremendous sense.

00:04:39.750 --> 00:04:41.541 align:middle line:84%
If you're living under
a lot of cloud cover

00:04:41.541 --> 00:04:43.470 align:middle line:84%
in a rainforest in
Byron Bay, Australia,

00:04:43.470 --> 00:04:45.240 align:middle line:84%
it doesn't make
quite so much sense.

00:04:45.240 --> 00:04:46.830 align:middle line:90%
There are other forms of energy.

00:04:46.830 --> 00:04:49.570 align:middle line:84%
The key is that one
size does not fit all.

00:04:49.570 --> 00:04:52.320 align:middle line:84%
And this is where the
centralized model in the past

00:04:52.320 --> 00:04:53.790 align:middle line:90%
has gotten us into trouble.

00:04:53.790 --> 00:04:59.280 align:middle line:84%
It has invited us to rely
upon a single source of energy

00:04:59.280 --> 00:05:02.715 align:middle line:84%
mostly burning of fossil fuels
that we know is not sustainable

00:05:02.715 --> 00:05:04.980 align:middle line:84%
and it's causing
more problems now

00:05:04.980 --> 00:05:08.200 align:middle line:84%
when, in fact, we have so many
localized and sustainable ways

00:05:08.200 --> 00:05:09.000 align:middle line:90%
of living.

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:10.650 align:middle line:84%
And some of them are
conventional, some of them

00:05:10.650 --> 00:05:11.490 align:middle line:90%
are unconventional.

00:05:11.490 --> 00:05:13.380 align:middle line:90%
We all know about wind.

00:05:13.380 --> 00:05:17.130 align:middle line:84%
Here in northern New Mexico
we have geothermal because

00:05:17.130 --> 00:05:18.555 align:middle line:90%
of the volcanic activity.

00:05:18.555 --> 00:05:21.150 align:middle line:84%
You drill a hole in
the ground, pump water

00:05:21.150 --> 00:05:24.332 align:middle line:84%
into the molten lava,
that turns into steam.

00:05:24.332 --> 00:05:26.040 align:middle line:84%
That steam drives the
turbines and you've

00:05:26.040 --> 00:05:28.410 align:middle line:84%
got a beautiful source
of electricity that's

00:05:28.410 --> 00:05:31.050 align:middle line:90%
not dependent on sun or wind.

00:05:31.050 --> 00:05:32.520 align:middle line:84%
So these are
examples of the kinds

00:05:32.520 --> 00:05:34.409 align:middle line:90%
of things in the near term.

00:05:34.409 --> 00:05:36.700 align:middle line:84%
One of the other questions
that people ask all the time

00:05:36.700 --> 00:05:38.190 align:middle line:90%
is what about free energy.

00:05:38.190 --> 00:05:39.900 align:middle line:84%
As a scientist, what
I can say to you

00:05:39.900 --> 00:05:43.570 align:middle line:84%
is the principles of free
energy, the physics exist.

00:05:43.570 --> 00:05:45.510 align:middle line:84%
And we are surrounded,
we are bathed

00:05:45.510 --> 00:05:49.560 align:middle line:84%
in energy that can be tapped
and used in a very real

00:05:49.560 --> 00:05:51.030 align:middle line:90%
and a commercial way.

00:05:51.030 --> 00:05:54.460 align:middle line:84%
Realistically, are those
systems available right now?

00:05:54.460 --> 00:05:56.460 align:middle line:84%
What I say to people that
ask me this, they say,

00:05:56.460 --> 00:05:58.251 align:middle line:84%
why aren't we using
these things right now?

00:05:58.251 --> 00:06:00.810 align:middle line:84%
And I say to them, the systems
that are available now,

00:06:00.810 --> 00:06:02.610 align:middle line:84%
to the best of my
knowledge I wouldn't want

00:06:02.610 --> 00:06:03.750 align:middle line:90%
to depend on those systems.

00:06:03.750 --> 00:06:06.110 align:middle line:84%
If I were on an operating
table in an operating room

00:06:06.110 --> 00:06:08.460 align:middle line:84%
and knew that those systems
were running all the power--

00:06:08.460 --> 00:06:11.110 align:middle line:84%
or if I were in an
airplane depending

00:06:11.110 --> 00:06:13.330 align:middle line:84%
upon those systems for
navigation and guidance--

00:06:13.330 --> 00:06:16.420 align:middle line:84%
they're not at the point where
I would want those things,

00:06:16.420 --> 00:06:18.340 align:middle line:90%
my life to depend upon them.

00:06:18.340 --> 00:06:22.720 align:middle line:84%
I think what we're
seeing is a gradation.

00:06:22.720 --> 00:06:27.970 align:middle line:10%
It's a phasing in of these
new forms of energy and forms

00:06:27.970 --> 00:06:29.470 align:middle line:10%
of economy.

00:06:29.470 --> 00:06:31.524 align:middle line:84%
Humans are very interesting
in this respect.

00:06:31.524 --> 00:06:33.190 align:middle line:84%
And we've talked about
this a little bit

00:06:33.190 --> 00:06:39.100 align:middle line:84%
before in that we seem to
learn what we do not want

00:06:39.100 --> 00:06:40.690 align:middle line:90%
by experiencing that first.

00:06:40.690 --> 00:06:43.689 align:middle line:84%
Rather than simply
saying, this is the way

00:06:43.689 --> 00:06:45.730 align:middle line:84%
we choose to live and
let's put all of our energy

00:06:45.730 --> 00:06:47.063 align:middle line:90%
into making these things happen.

00:06:47.063 --> 00:06:50.120 align:middle line:90%


00:06:50.120 --> 00:06:52.312 align:middle line:84%
It seems that we experience
war, for example,

00:06:52.312 --> 00:06:54.270 align:middle line:84%
before we say we don't
want that we want peace.

00:06:54.270 --> 00:06:56.820 align:middle line:84%
Or we experience a breakdown
of the financial system

00:06:56.820 --> 00:06:58.500 align:middle line:84%
before we say, we
don't want that.

00:06:58.500 --> 00:07:00.060 align:middle line:90%
Let's regulate that.

00:07:00.060 --> 00:07:06.600 align:middle line:84%
So we could, in a
six month period

00:07:06.600 --> 00:07:08.490 align:middle line:84%
of time, the
leaders of the world

00:07:08.490 --> 00:07:10.290 align:middle line:84%
could come together
and say, hey, look.

00:07:10.290 --> 00:07:12.750 align:middle line:84%
All these new technologies
already exist.

00:07:12.750 --> 00:07:14.790 align:middle line:90%
Let's put the world on hold.

00:07:14.790 --> 00:07:16.110 align:middle line:90%
Let's put our people to work.

00:07:16.110 --> 00:07:17.220 align:middle line:90%
Let's give people jobs.

00:07:17.220 --> 00:07:19.652 align:middle line:84%
Let's rebuild an infrastructure
and six months from now

00:07:19.652 --> 00:07:20.860 align:middle line:90%
we're going to push a button.

00:07:20.860 --> 00:07:23.320 align:middle line:84%
And we're going to be clean,
green, sustainable, smart grid,

00:07:23.320 --> 00:07:25.403 align:middle line:84%
and we'll never looked
back at fossil fuels again.

00:07:25.403 --> 00:07:26.550 align:middle line:90%
That could happen.

00:07:26.550 --> 00:07:28.230 align:middle line:84%
Is it going to
happen, realistically?

00:07:28.230 --> 00:07:29.430 align:middle line:90%
Probably not.

00:07:29.430 --> 00:07:31.230 align:middle line:10%
So realistically,
what we're doing

00:07:31.230 --> 00:07:34.500 align:middle line:10%
is we're doing this
piecemeal, step by step,

00:07:34.500 --> 00:07:40.440 align:middle line:10%
as aspects of the centralized
forms of economy--

00:07:40.440 --> 00:07:44.010 align:middle line:10%
food, medicine, communications,
energy, defense,

00:07:44.010 --> 00:07:45.810 align:middle line:10%
all these things, finances--

00:07:45.810 --> 00:07:48.106 align:middle line:10%
as they break down, we're
fixing them piecemeal.

00:07:48.106 --> 00:07:50.230 align:middle line:84%
And I'm not saying it's
good, bad, right, or wrong.

00:07:50.230 --> 00:07:51.960 align:middle line:90%
It just is a path we've taken.

00:07:51.960 --> 00:07:54.620 align:middle line:84%
Ultimately, they
are stepping stones.

00:07:54.620 --> 00:07:58.260 align:middle line:84%
They're leading us toward
what you and I both know

00:07:58.260 --> 00:08:01.230 align:middle line:84%
is possible for us and
our children in our world.

00:08:01.230 --> 00:08:04.810 align:middle line:84%
And that is a world where we
live in harmony with nature.

00:08:04.810 --> 00:08:07.200 align:middle line:84%
Localized living is
the way nature works.

00:08:07.200 --> 00:08:11.940 align:middle line:10%
And that should be the model
for the way we live our lives.

00:08:11.940 --> 00:08:14.700 align:middle line:84%
So one of the questions that
people ask me all the time,

00:08:14.700 --> 00:08:17.490 align:middle line:84%
and this is true in
every country I go to,

00:08:17.490 --> 00:08:19.770 align:middle line:84%
when they talk about
the economy they're

00:08:19.770 --> 00:08:22.290 align:middle line:90%
being very specific about money.

00:08:22.290 --> 00:08:24.690 align:middle line:84%
And this is the physical
money that we all use

00:08:24.690 --> 00:08:25.810 align:middle line:90%
and that we all depend on.

00:08:25.810 --> 00:08:27.090 align:middle line:84%
They say, where are we
going with the money?

00:08:27.090 --> 00:08:28.462 align:middle line:90%
What's happening with the money?

00:08:28.462 --> 00:08:29.670 align:middle line:90%
So I'm going to preface this.

00:08:29.670 --> 00:08:33.330 align:middle line:84%
I'm a scientist and when I
give you a scientific answer

00:08:33.330 --> 00:08:35.610 align:middle line:84%
I identify it as a
scientific answer.

00:08:35.610 --> 00:08:36.870 align:middle line:90%
I'm not an economist.

00:08:36.870 --> 00:08:39.522 align:middle line:84%
I've spent a lot of energy,
my energy researching this.

00:08:39.522 --> 00:08:40.980 align:middle line:84%
So I'm going to
share with you what

00:08:40.980 --> 00:08:43.679 align:middle line:84%
I have found to be true to
the best of my knowledge.

00:08:43.679 --> 00:08:46.110 align:middle line:84%
The global financial
system is changing.

00:08:46.110 --> 00:08:47.640 align:middle line:84%
And one of the
reasons it's changing

00:08:47.640 --> 00:08:50.160 align:middle line:84%
is because it is now a
global financial system.

00:08:50.160 --> 00:08:53.160 align:middle line:84%
We never have had this in
the history of the world.

00:08:53.160 --> 00:08:56.074 align:middle line:84%
The world has never been
connected the way that we

00:08:56.074 --> 00:08:57.240 align:middle line:90%
see the world connected now.

00:08:57.240 --> 00:09:00.457 align:middle line:84%
We've never lived in a
truly globalized society.

00:09:00.457 --> 00:09:02.040 align:middle line:84%
And people ask me
all the time, are we

00:09:02.040 --> 00:09:04.679 align:middle line:84%
going to a global government,
a one-world government?

00:09:04.679 --> 00:09:06.220 align:middle line:84%
Are we going to a
one-world currency?

00:09:06.220 --> 00:09:08.460 align:middle line:84%
And my answer is, we're
pretty much already there.

00:09:08.460 --> 00:09:10.030 align:middle line:90%
Nobody told us when it happened.

00:09:10.030 --> 00:09:13.710 align:middle line:84%
It wasn't like, flash,
CNN, BBC World--

00:09:13.710 --> 00:09:17.130 align:middle line:84%
one-world government,
one-world monetary system.

00:09:17.130 --> 00:09:21.310 align:middle line:84%
But if you think about it,
we've got a 24/7 global stock

00:09:21.310 --> 00:09:22.110 align:middle line:90%
exchange.

00:09:22.110 --> 00:09:23.026 align:middle line:90%
We already have that--

00:09:23.026 --> 00:09:26.500 align:middle line:84%
24/7 global news, 24/7
global communications,

00:09:26.500 --> 00:09:28.320 align:middle line:84%
we've already got
global defense.

00:09:28.320 --> 00:09:30.780 align:middle line:84%
We've got global energy
sharing, global technology,

00:09:30.780 --> 00:09:32.117 align:middle line:90%
global medicine.

00:09:32.117 --> 00:09:34.200 align:middle line:84%
The way that governments
are now working together,

00:09:34.200 --> 00:09:38.370 align:middle line:84%
in many respects they are
cooperating in a global sense.

00:09:38.370 --> 00:09:39.900 align:middle line:84%
So where are we
going with all this?

00:09:39.900 --> 00:09:42.670 align:middle line:84%
Ultimately, ultimately,
at some point,

00:09:42.670 --> 00:09:47.340 align:middle line:84%
I think we will see more
of what we would interpret

00:09:47.340 --> 00:09:49.540 align:middle line:90%
as a global government.

00:09:49.540 --> 00:09:51.690 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't mean that
there is one person that's

00:09:51.690 --> 00:09:54.000 align:middle line:84%
dictating what's happening
with everyone else.

00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:57.960 align:middle line:84%
It is more of the sense where
the world has the opportunity

00:09:57.960 --> 00:10:01.655 align:middle line:84%
to chime in on the input of the
policies that are happening.

00:10:01.655 --> 00:10:03.030 align:middle line:84%
And I think you're
already seeing

00:10:03.030 --> 00:10:05.310 align:middle line:90%
this happen in our world today.

00:10:05.310 --> 00:10:06.690 align:middle line:90%
And the same is true with money.

00:10:06.690 --> 00:10:08.231 align:middle line:84%
So this is where
I'm going with this.

00:10:08.231 --> 00:10:11.940 align:middle line:84%
People ask, are we going
to lose physical money?

00:10:11.940 --> 00:10:15.630 align:middle line:10%
My sense is we will always have
among us in our communities,

00:10:15.630 --> 00:10:17.550 align:middle line:10%
we will always have
an Australian dollar,

00:10:17.550 --> 00:10:19.250 align:middle line:10%
a Canadian dollar,
an American dollar

00:10:19.250 --> 00:10:23.610 align:middle line:10%
to exchange at the grocery
store or for a tank of gas.

00:10:23.610 --> 00:10:28.270 align:middle line:84%
But the role of that
dollar is going to change.

00:10:28.270 --> 00:10:30.000 align:middle line:84%
And there are already
efforts right now--

00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:34.360 align:middle line:84%
the G20 met recently,
this is the year 2017.

00:10:34.360 --> 00:10:38.070 align:middle line:84%
2016, and as far
back as 2008/2009,

00:10:38.070 --> 00:10:41.010 align:middle line:84%
after the financial
crisis, they've

00:10:41.010 --> 00:10:44.700 align:middle line:84%
proposed-- the G20, the 20
most powerful economic forces

00:10:44.700 --> 00:10:48.090 align:middle line:84%
on the Earth-- proposing
a cashless society.

00:10:48.090 --> 00:10:49.410 align:middle line:90%
So is that good or bad?

00:10:49.410 --> 00:10:50.940 align:middle line:90%
Is it right or wrong?

00:10:50.940 --> 00:10:54.421 align:middle line:84%
People ask me that, I say, it's
all about how it's implemented.

00:10:54.421 --> 00:10:56.670 align:middle line:84%
If it's implemented for the
purpose of bringing people

00:10:56.670 --> 00:11:02.580 align:middle line:84%
together for accountability
and to honor people and the way

00:11:02.580 --> 00:11:05.090 align:middle line:84%
that we exchange
vital resources,

00:11:05.090 --> 00:11:06.750 align:middle line:90%
it could be a very good thing.

00:11:06.750 --> 00:11:09.720 align:middle line:84%
If it is implemented
with the greed

00:11:09.720 --> 00:11:12.384 align:middle line:84%
that we have seen in the past
from large centralized banks

00:11:12.384 --> 00:11:13.800 align:middle line:84%
and corporations--
we already know

00:11:13.800 --> 00:11:16.626 align:middle line:84%
what that looks like because
we're living in it right now.

00:11:16.626 --> 00:11:18.000 align:middle line:84%
So ultimately,
when we're talking

00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:20.620 align:middle line:84%
about a global currency,
is it going to happen?

00:11:20.620 --> 00:11:22.620 align:middle line:84%
Well, what I can tell
you, is it's already here.

00:11:22.620 --> 00:11:24.036 align:middle line:84%
We already have a
global currency.

00:11:24.036 --> 00:11:26.490 align:middle line:84%
It's a currency very few
people have heard about,

00:11:26.490 --> 00:11:30.630 align:middle line:84%
but it's already in use
between the central banks.

00:11:30.630 --> 00:11:32.250 align:middle line:10%
It's called the SDR.

00:11:32.250 --> 00:11:35.460 align:middle line:84%
SDR means Special
Drawing Rights.

00:11:35.460 --> 00:11:37.860 align:middle line:10%
This is a form of currency
when the Federal Reserve,

00:11:37.860 --> 00:11:40.562 align:middle line:10%
for example, gives money to
the European Central Bank

00:11:40.562 --> 00:11:41.520 align:middle line:10%
or something like that.

00:11:41.520 --> 00:11:44.040 align:middle line:84%
This is the currency
that they use.

00:11:44.040 --> 00:11:47.420 align:middle line:84%
And because it is
a solvent currency,

00:11:47.420 --> 00:11:51.780 align:middle line:84%
it is not burdened in the way
that other currencies are right

00:11:51.780 --> 00:11:54.630 align:middle line:84%
now, including the
dollar, it's being

00:11:54.630 --> 00:11:56.452 align:middle line:90%
accepted as a global currency.

00:11:56.452 --> 00:11:58.410 align:middle line:84%
So this is a currency
that's going to be used--

00:11:58.410 --> 00:12:01.980 align:middle line:84%
it's already existing--
it'll be used more widespread

00:12:01.980 --> 00:12:05.520 align:middle line:84%
and more applications
is how it will be used.

00:12:05.520 --> 00:12:07.666 align:middle line:84%
When it comes down to us
and our everyday lives,

00:12:07.666 --> 00:12:09.540 align:middle line:84%
this is what people are
really interested in.

00:12:09.540 --> 00:12:13.020 align:middle line:84%
As I mentioned, I think we'll
still use our local currencies

00:12:13.020 --> 00:12:14.490 align:middle line:90%
for the time being.

00:12:14.490 --> 00:12:16.620 align:middle line:84%
Ultimately, I
think we are moving

00:12:16.620 --> 00:12:18.309 align:middle line:90%
toward a cashless society.

00:12:18.309 --> 00:12:20.850 align:middle line:84%
And there have been movements
that some countries are already

00:12:20.850 --> 00:12:24.910 align:middle line:84%
taking denominations of their
currency out of circulation.

00:12:24.910 --> 00:12:28.170 align:middle line:84%
And I personally have
been to businesses here

00:12:28.170 --> 00:12:31.110 align:middle line:84%
in the United States
that refuse my cash.

00:12:31.110 --> 00:12:34.710 align:middle line:84%
I was staying at a hotel,
I had an early flight--

00:12:34.710 --> 00:12:37.080 align:middle line:84%
I won't share the name
of the hotel chain.

00:12:37.080 --> 00:12:39.420 align:middle line:84%
I went to the front
desk and I was

00:12:39.420 --> 00:12:42.030 align:middle line:84%
trying to use credit cards
as little as possible.

00:12:42.030 --> 00:12:44.970 align:middle line:84%
And they said, we are not
equipped to take your cash

00:12:44.970 --> 00:12:46.150 align:middle line:90%
to pay for this.

00:12:46.150 --> 00:12:48.682 align:middle line:84%
And I recently was
at a restaurant

00:12:48.682 --> 00:12:49.640 align:middle line:90%
and had the same thing.

00:12:49.640 --> 00:12:51.098 align:middle line:84%
I didn't even think
twice about it.

00:12:51.098 --> 00:12:52.166 align:middle line:90%
I paid the man cash--

00:12:52.166 --> 00:12:54.040 align:middle line:84%
because I don't like to
use credit cards when

00:12:54.040 --> 00:12:57.810 align:middle line:84%
I'm traveling so much
because of identity theft

00:12:57.810 --> 00:12:58.980 align:middle line:90%
and things like that--

00:12:58.980 --> 00:13:00.250 align:middle line:90%
and they refused my cash.

00:13:00.250 --> 00:13:03.720 align:middle line:84%
So this is already
happening in some places.

00:13:03.720 --> 00:13:05.880 align:middle line:84%
I want to say one
more thing quickly.

00:13:05.880 --> 00:13:10.940 align:middle line:84%
In rural communities, the
idea of a cashless society

00:13:10.940 --> 00:13:13.650 align:middle line:84%
has been around for
a very long time.

00:13:13.650 --> 00:13:17.020 align:middle line:84%
And we see these not only
in the mountain states

00:13:17.020 --> 00:13:18.020 align:middle line:90%
or in the high deserts--

00:13:18.020 --> 00:13:19.730 align:middle line:84%
Colorado, New Mexico,
Arizona-- but I've

00:13:19.730 --> 00:13:21.290 align:middle line:90%
seen them back east, as well.

00:13:21.290 --> 00:13:24.170 align:middle line:10%
Barter-- and there are
very formalized ways

00:13:24.170 --> 00:13:27.080 align:middle line:10%
of doing barter
where people register

00:13:27.080 --> 00:13:29.030 align:middle line:10%
their particular skills
or their talents.

00:13:29.030 --> 00:13:30.920 align:middle line:90%
It's like a tally sheet.

00:13:30.920 --> 00:13:33.080 align:middle line:84%
And when someone needs
a roof on their house,

00:13:33.080 --> 00:13:35.450 align:middle line:84%
the person that can
do the roof goes

00:13:35.450 --> 00:13:37.340 align:middle line:84%
and puts the roof on
their house and charges

00:13:37.340 --> 00:13:40.070 align:middle line:84%
so many-- they are called green
units-- the system is you don't

00:13:40.070 --> 00:13:42.329 align:middle line:90%
exchange them hand to hand.

00:13:42.329 --> 00:13:44.870 align:middle line:84%
So many green units went into
putting the roof on that house.

00:13:44.870 --> 00:13:47.450 align:middle line:10%
And now someone needs a
transmission in their car.

00:13:47.450 --> 00:13:50.090 align:middle line:10%
And another person will
go and the exchange

00:13:50.090 --> 00:13:54.140 align:middle line:10%
happens on this tally sheet
so that ultimately people

00:13:54.140 --> 00:13:56.600 align:middle line:10%
are getting what they
need from their neighbors

00:13:56.600 --> 00:14:00.560 align:middle line:10%
in a sustainable way without
any cash ever changing hands.

00:14:00.560 --> 00:14:01.850 align:middle line:90%
It's very difficult to tax.

00:14:01.850 --> 00:14:05.540 align:middle line:84%
And this is a
problem where the IRS

00:14:05.540 --> 00:14:08.670 align:middle line:84%
has as a big problem with things
like this for this reason.

00:14:08.670 --> 00:14:11.160 align:middle line:90%
So it's not a perfect system.

00:14:11.160 --> 00:14:13.550 align:middle line:84%
But it is a system that is in
place and is used commonly.

00:14:13.550 --> 00:14:16.130 align:middle line:90%


00:14:16.130 --> 00:14:18.680 align:middle line:84%
My experience, this is what I
think is happening-- in steps,

00:14:18.680 --> 00:14:20.545 align:middle line:84%
we're moving toward
a cashless society.

00:14:20.545 --> 00:14:21.920 align:middle line:84%
These are some of
the steps we'll

00:14:21.920 --> 00:14:24.560 align:middle line:84%
go through, global
currency, the devaluing

00:14:24.560 --> 00:14:28.100 align:middle line:84%
of our local currencies,
ultimately, to the point where

00:14:28.100 --> 00:14:30.320 align:middle line:90%
we are electronic currencies.

00:14:30.320 --> 00:14:33.140 align:middle line:84%
People ask about
Bitcoin all the time.

00:14:33.140 --> 00:14:34.380 align:middle line:90%
I'm not a Bitcoin expert.

00:14:34.380 --> 00:14:37.400 align:middle line:90%
I'm not a big fan of Bitcoin.

00:14:37.400 --> 00:14:38.732 align:middle line:90%
I like the idea.

00:14:38.732 --> 00:14:40.190 align:middle line:84%
The way it was
implemented, I think

00:14:40.190 --> 00:14:41.660 align:middle line:90%
it could have been done better.

00:14:41.660 --> 00:14:43.160 align:middle line:10%
There are some
loopholes and I think

00:14:43.160 --> 00:14:45.110 align:middle line:10%
we've all seen some
of the drawbacks

00:14:45.110 --> 00:14:48.650 align:middle line:10%
where the Bitcoin has
lost value overnight

00:14:48.650 --> 00:14:50.900 align:middle line:10%
and people lost tremendous
amounts of money.

00:14:50.900 --> 00:14:52.880 align:middle line:10%
It can be implemented I
think, in a better way.

00:14:52.880 --> 00:14:55.200 align:middle line:84%
But we're in
uncharted territory.

00:14:55.200 --> 00:14:56.420 align:middle line:90%
This is the thing.

00:14:56.420 --> 00:15:01.400 align:middle line:84%
We are a global community in
an uncharted territory forging

00:15:01.400 --> 00:15:03.500 align:middle line:84%
our way forward, trying
to do something has never

00:15:03.500 --> 00:15:04.644 align:middle line:90%
been done before.

00:15:04.644 --> 00:15:05.810 align:middle line:90%
And I think that's exciting.

00:15:05.810 --> 00:15:07.910 align:middle line:10%
And I couldn't think
of a more exciting time

00:15:07.910 --> 00:15:11.240 align:middle line:10%
to be experimenting with all
of these different things.

00:15:11.240 --> 00:15:13.130 align:middle line:10%
But I think the
key here is, when

00:15:13.130 --> 00:15:15.290 align:middle line:10%
we find that something
doesn't work,

00:15:15.290 --> 00:15:17.540 align:middle line:10%
rather than clinging
to it and trying

00:15:17.540 --> 00:15:19.949 align:middle line:10%
to force a square
peg in a round hole

00:15:19.949 --> 00:15:21.740 align:middle line:10%
like we see happening
in the European Union

00:15:21.740 --> 00:15:25.340 align:middle line:10%
right now which is
undergoing a change--

00:15:25.340 --> 00:15:31.160 align:middle line:10%
Because one policy set in one
nation cannot possibly fit

00:15:31.160 --> 00:15:34.730 align:middle line:10%
for all of the 28 nations
that were involved originally

00:15:34.730 --> 00:15:37.040 align:middle line:10%
in the European Union.

00:15:37.040 --> 00:15:38.900 align:middle line:84%
So it's changing
to reflect that.

00:15:38.900 --> 00:15:41.090 align:middle line:84%
And I think the smart
thing for us to do,

00:15:41.090 --> 00:15:44.090 align:middle line:84%
if we have the wisdom to
recognize when a system is

00:15:44.090 --> 00:15:48.290 align:middle line:84%
no longer working, to
allow the change to flow

00:15:48.290 --> 00:15:51.830 align:middle line:84%
and to find new ways to
implement what does work,

00:15:51.830 --> 00:15:53.900 align:middle line:84%
rather than trying to
cling to something that's

00:15:53.900 --> 00:15:56.476 align:middle line:84%
not sustainable and
forcing it where

00:15:56.476 --> 00:15:57.600 align:middle line:90%
people aren't accepting it.

00:15:57.600 --> 00:16:01.480 align:middle line:90%


00:16:01.480 --> 00:16:04.240 align:middle line:84%
People ask me all
the time if I sense

00:16:04.240 --> 00:16:08.530 align:middle line:84%
that we are heading toward a
crash in the economic system,

00:16:08.530 --> 00:16:11.170 align:middle line:84%
whether it's America's
economy or whether it's

00:16:11.170 --> 00:16:12.910 align:middle line:90%
a global economy?

00:16:12.910 --> 00:16:14.432 align:middle line:90%
I don't know the answer to that.

00:16:14.432 --> 00:16:16.390 align:middle line:84%
I don't know that we're
heading toward a crash.

00:16:16.390 --> 00:16:18.355 align:middle line:84%
What I do know is
this the system that

00:16:18.355 --> 00:16:22.450 align:middle line:84%
is in place right now is being
stretched like a rubber band.

00:16:22.450 --> 00:16:23.890 align:middle line:90%
And it can only stretch so far.

00:16:23.890 --> 00:16:26.210 align:middle line:90%
Something has to give.

00:16:26.210 --> 00:16:28.390 align:middle line:84%
Where this stretching
is occurring right now

00:16:28.390 --> 00:16:31.420 align:middle line:84%
is the debt that
has been accrued.

00:16:31.420 --> 00:16:37.310 align:middle line:84%
When a city goes bankrupt, it
can be bailed out by a state.

00:16:37.310 --> 00:16:39.947 align:middle line:84%
Or when a state goes bankrupt
in the United States of America

00:16:39.947 --> 00:16:41.530 align:middle line:84%
it's common for the
federal government

00:16:41.530 --> 00:16:42.850 align:middle line:90%
to bail out that state.

00:16:42.850 --> 00:16:45.220 align:middle line:84%
And we've all seen
that happen and we have

00:16:45.220 --> 00:16:46.880 align:middle line:90%
a lot of experience with that.

00:16:46.880 --> 00:16:48.190 align:middle line:90%
Here's the question.

00:16:48.190 --> 00:16:54.640 align:middle line:84%
What happens when the debt of
the nations of an entire planet

00:16:54.640 --> 00:16:59.110 align:middle line:84%
becomes greater than the GDP,
than what they are producing?

00:16:59.110 --> 00:17:02.230 align:middle line:84%
What happens when an entire
planet goes bankrupt?

00:17:02.230 --> 00:17:04.597 align:middle line:90%
Who bails out a planet?

00:17:04.597 --> 00:17:06.180 align:middle line:84%
I don't know the
answer to that, and I

00:17:06.180 --> 00:17:07.089 align:middle line:90%
don't know that anyone does.

00:17:07.089 --> 00:17:08.440 align:middle line:90%
I think we're going to find out.

00:17:08.440 --> 00:17:12.310 align:middle line:84%
Because the debt of
the entire planet,

00:17:12.310 --> 00:17:15.970 align:middle line:84%
now, is essentially-- we
are a bankrupt planet.

00:17:15.970 --> 00:17:19.150 align:middle line:84%
The major economic nations
have assumed the policy

00:17:19.150 --> 00:17:21.700 align:middle line:90%
of creating this debt.

00:17:21.700 --> 00:17:25.540 align:middle line:84%
And the money is leveraged
to such a degree,

00:17:25.540 --> 00:17:27.730 align:middle line:84%
I think, it will be
very difficult to ever

00:17:27.730 --> 00:17:30.280 align:middle line:84%
realistically pay down the
debt, including America's debt.

00:17:30.280 --> 00:17:34.420 align:middle line:84%
I think America right now,
our debt ratio is about 105%.

00:17:34.420 --> 00:17:37.450 align:middle line:84%
Which means, we
owe more than we're

00:17:37.450 --> 00:17:39.790 align:middle line:90%
able to produce by over 5%.

00:17:39.790 --> 00:17:43.300 align:middle line:84%
Other nations 30%
and 40% over that.

00:17:43.300 --> 00:17:46.887 align:middle line:84%
So if that were you and me, we
would say that we're bankrupt

00:17:46.887 --> 00:17:48.970 align:middle line:84%
and we wouldn't be allowed
to function any longer.

00:17:48.970 --> 00:17:53.847 align:middle line:84%
Nations continue but
this debt accumulates.

00:17:53.847 --> 00:17:55.930 align:middle line:84%
And it accumulates because
of the interest that is

00:17:55.930 --> 00:17:57.250 align:middle line:90%
owed on the debt we're paying.

00:17:57.250 --> 00:17:58.840 align:middle line:90%
So it is an unsustainable cycle.

00:17:58.840 --> 00:18:00.550 align:middle line:90%
Something's got to give.

00:18:00.550 --> 00:18:03.520 align:middle line:84%
The question is, do we
have a soft landing?

00:18:03.520 --> 00:18:08.350 align:middle line:84%
Do we have leaders who
are proactive and are

00:18:08.350 --> 00:18:13.150 align:middle line:84%
willing to actually lead
nations and the world

00:18:13.150 --> 00:18:16.150 align:middle line:84%
together into a new
form of economy?

00:18:16.150 --> 00:18:20.170 align:middle line:84%
Or do we have a hard landing,
do we have a crash landing

00:18:20.170 --> 00:18:22.270 align:middle line:84%
where we wait for
the system to break?

00:18:22.270 --> 00:18:24.640 align:middle line:84%
And then we say, OK, here's
what we're going to do.

00:18:24.640 --> 00:18:26.660 align:middle line:90%
I don't know the answer to that.

00:18:26.660 --> 00:18:30.610 align:middle line:84%
But what I know is, this
is precisely the reason

00:18:30.610 --> 00:18:33.520 align:middle line:84%
that the conversation we had a
little earlier about localized

00:18:33.520 --> 00:18:35.200 align:middle line:90%
economy is important.

00:18:35.200 --> 00:18:38.470 align:middle line:84%
Because what we saw the last
time the economy crashed

00:18:38.470 --> 00:18:42.130 align:middle line:84%
is that localized economies
are affected much, much less,

00:18:42.130 --> 00:18:46.300 align:middle line:84%
to a lesser degree, than
centralized economies.

00:18:46.300 --> 00:18:50.260 align:middle line:10%
So to the degree that we
can keep our money local--

00:18:50.260 --> 00:18:52.750 align:middle line:10%
and again, there are
rural communities,

00:18:52.750 --> 00:18:54.730 align:middle line:10%
northern New Mexico,
Colorado I'm familiar with

00:18:54.730 --> 00:18:56.920 align:middle line:10%
because that's my home--

00:18:56.920 --> 00:18:59.410 align:middle line:10%
we encourage buying locally.

00:18:59.410 --> 00:19:02.650 align:middle line:84%
We buy our produce locally,
buy our automobiles locally,

00:19:02.650 --> 00:19:04.765 align:middle line:84%
instead of going
to another city.

00:19:04.765 --> 00:19:06.610 align:middle line:84%
And maybe we get a
little bit better deal.

00:19:06.610 --> 00:19:08.560 align:middle line:84%
We spend more money to
keep the money local.

00:19:08.560 --> 00:19:11.980 align:middle line:84%
These are the things I think
that will help sustain us

00:19:11.980 --> 00:19:14.820 align:middle line:90%
as individuals.

00:19:14.820 --> 00:19:16.770 align:middle line:84%
The United States
debt, a lot of people

00:19:16.770 --> 00:19:19.110 align:middle line:84%
don't understand
why it happened.

00:19:19.110 --> 00:19:20.970 align:middle line:84%
We've had tremendous
amounts of debt before.

00:19:20.970 --> 00:19:24.810 align:middle line:84%
World War II, the debt we ran up
was tremendous to fight a war.

00:19:24.810 --> 00:19:27.450 align:middle line:84%
And we paid it back
almost immediately.

00:19:27.450 --> 00:19:31.260 align:middle line:10%
When citizens, you and I,
we bought savings bonds.

00:19:31.260 --> 00:19:34.632 align:middle line:10%
A savings bond was
us buying a bond,

00:19:34.632 --> 00:19:36.340 align:middle line:10%
it was loaning the
government some money.

00:19:36.340 --> 00:19:38.730 align:middle line:10%
I remember when I was
a kid, for my birthday,

00:19:38.730 --> 00:19:41.400 align:middle line:10%
my grandparents would
always proudly hand me,

00:19:41.400 --> 00:19:43.170 align:middle line:10%
here's a United
States Savings Bond

00:19:43.170 --> 00:19:45.336 align:middle line:10%
you save it until it's
maturity and you put yourself

00:19:45.336 --> 00:19:48.040 align:middle line:10%
through college, or
something like that.

00:19:48.040 --> 00:19:48.840 align:middle line:90%
But we did that.

00:19:48.840 --> 00:19:50.160 align:middle line:90%
We paid back the debt.

00:19:50.160 --> 00:19:54.450 align:middle line:84%
Also we levied something called
an income tax, which did not

00:19:54.450 --> 00:19:56.644 align:middle line:90%
exist prior to that time.

00:19:56.644 --> 00:19:58.560 align:middle line:84%
So the people say, well,
we paid it back then.

00:19:58.560 --> 00:20:00.030 align:middle line:90%
Why can't we pay this debt?

00:20:00.030 --> 00:20:03.389 align:middle line:84%
Because we already have used all
of the ammunition that we have.

00:20:03.389 --> 00:20:04.680 align:middle line:90%
We already have the income tax.

00:20:04.680 --> 00:20:06.950 align:middle line:84%
We can't implement
something we already have.

00:20:06.950 --> 00:20:09.247 align:middle line:84%
The savings bonds, we
have bonds, as well.

00:20:09.247 --> 00:20:11.080 align:middle line:84%
They're called something
a little different,

00:20:11.080 --> 00:20:13.800 align:middle line:84%
but they're working
the same way.

00:20:13.800 --> 00:20:16.230 align:middle line:84%
And the third thing I
want to say very quickly

00:20:16.230 --> 00:20:21.810 align:middle line:84%
is up until early 1970s
our currency was linked,

00:20:21.810 --> 00:20:26.640 align:middle line:84%
it was pegged to something that
was solid, tangible, and real.

00:20:26.640 --> 00:20:28.260 align:middle line:90%
It was linked to gold.

00:20:28.260 --> 00:20:30.810 align:middle line:90%
Gold was about $32 an ounce.

00:20:30.810 --> 00:20:33.330 align:middle line:84%
And every dollar that
we held in our hand

00:20:33.330 --> 00:20:36.810 align:middle line:84%
was a paper representation,
a convenient way

00:20:36.810 --> 00:20:39.369 align:middle line:84%
of using that gold rather than
carrying heavy gold around

00:20:39.369 --> 00:20:40.410 align:middle line:90%
or silver in your pocket.

00:20:40.410 --> 00:20:42.870 align:middle line:84%
You'd say, this piece of
paper represents that.

00:20:42.870 --> 00:20:45.760 align:middle line:10%
And it actually said, a Silver
Certificate on the dollar bill,

00:20:45.760 --> 00:20:48.960 align:middle line:10%
or we knew that dollars
were back in gold.

00:20:48.960 --> 00:20:53.400 align:middle line:84%
1971, President Nixon
de-coupled the US dollar

00:20:53.400 --> 00:20:55.920 align:middle line:90%
from the gold standard.

00:20:55.920 --> 00:21:01.440 align:middle line:84%
So that meant that we could
begin printing more money

00:21:01.440 --> 00:21:04.140 align:middle line:90%
than the gold could back.

00:21:04.140 --> 00:21:06.750 align:middle line:84%
And this is where we started
getting into trouble.

00:21:06.750 --> 00:21:11.380 align:middle line:84%
This is where the debt and
the inflation actually began.

00:21:11.380 --> 00:21:14.080 align:middle line:84%
So there are proposals
now to go back

00:21:14.080 --> 00:21:15.790 align:middle line:90%
to some kind of a gold standard.

00:21:15.790 --> 00:21:17.950 align:middle line:84%
Whether that happens
or not, I don't know.

00:21:17.950 --> 00:21:22.000 align:middle line:84%
China is amassing
tremendous amounts of gold

00:21:22.000 --> 00:21:23.830 align:middle line:84%
to give them
financial credibility.

00:21:23.830 --> 00:21:25.480 align:middle line:84%
And they'd like to
go to gold standard.

00:21:25.480 --> 00:21:27.580 align:middle line:90%
India is doing the same thing.

00:21:27.580 --> 00:21:29.900 align:middle line:90%
Russia is doing the same thing.

00:21:29.900 --> 00:21:32.110 align:middle line:10%
So there is a
movement we're seeing

00:21:32.110 --> 00:21:34.450 align:middle line:10%
in the markets of
nations amassing

00:21:34.450 --> 00:21:36.490 align:middle line:10%
tremendous amounts
of gold, presumably

00:21:36.490 --> 00:21:38.110 align:middle line:10%
so that they can
peg their currencies

00:21:38.110 --> 00:21:41.440 align:middle line:10%
to this tangible
asset once again

00:21:41.440 --> 00:21:44.770 align:middle line:10%
and maybe get this debt under
control for a soft landing.

00:21:44.770 --> 00:21:48.160 align:middle line:84%
We'll keep our eyes peeled
and see what happens.

00:21:48.160 --> 00:21:52.690 align:middle line:84%
But this is where it looks like
we're going with all of this.

00:21:52.690 --> 00:21:55.210 align:middle line:84%
I think it's obvious
to anyone who

00:21:55.210 --> 00:21:56.679 align:middle line:84%
is in any way
engaged in the world

00:21:56.679 --> 00:21:58.720 align:middle line:84%
that we are, in fact,
living in time of extremes.

00:21:58.720 --> 00:22:01.570 align:middle line:84%
And those extremes are touching
every facet of our lives.

00:22:01.570 --> 00:22:04.360 align:middle line:84%
And the question that comes up
so many times-- and that I ask,

00:22:04.360 --> 00:22:06.280 align:middle line:90%
myself, constantly--

00:22:06.280 --> 00:22:07.570 align:middle line:90%
how do we keep positive?

00:22:07.570 --> 00:22:10.780 align:middle line:84%
I mean, how do we keep
a positive outlook

00:22:10.780 --> 00:22:14.380 align:middle line:84%
and live our lives in a
meaningful, productive way,

00:22:14.380 --> 00:22:16.650 align:middle line:84%
in a useful way, every
day of our lives,

00:22:16.650 --> 00:22:18.649 align:middle line:84%
knowing that all these
things are happening?

00:22:18.649 --> 00:22:20.440 align:middle line:84%
That's one of the
reasons that I've created

00:22:20.440 --> 00:22:22.000 align:middle line:90%
"Missing Links" for you.

00:22:22.000 --> 00:22:23.980 align:middle line:84%
Because I want you
to know why I'm

00:22:23.980 --> 00:22:25.660 align:middle line:90%
optimistic about our future.

00:22:25.660 --> 00:22:28.240 align:middle line:84%
I've never been more optimistic
about my nation, the United

00:22:28.240 --> 00:22:30.777 align:middle line:84%
States, your nation, all
nations, the world, our future.

00:22:30.777 --> 00:22:32.110 align:middle line:90%
I've never been more optimistic.

00:22:32.110 --> 00:22:33.980 align:middle line:90%
And here's the reason why.

00:22:33.980 --> 00:22:36.130 align:middle line:84%
Because, we now know
what doesn't work.

00:22:36.130 --> 00:22:37.180 align:middle line:90%
We know what's broken.

00:22:37.180 --> 00:22:39.700 align:middle line:10%
We know what's not
sustainable, on the one hand.

00:22:39.700 --> 00:22:41.151 align:middle line:84%
And on the other
hand, we already

00:22:41.151 --> 00:22:43.650 align:middle line:84%
have all the solutions to all
the big problems in the world.

00:22:43.650 --> 00:22:45.250 align:middle line:90%
They already exist.

00:22:45.250 --> 00:22:49.570 align:middle line:84%
We don't have to get all of
the leaders of the corporations

00:22:49.570 --> 00:22:52.390 align:middle line:84%
and the politicians
and the spiritual

00:22:52.390 --> 00:22:54.880 align:middle line:84%
and the religious leaders
and scientists and engineers

00:22:54.880 --> 00:22:57.280 align:middle line:84%
and the technological
people together in a room

00:22:57.280 --> 00:22:59.110 align:middle line:84%
and say, OK, figure
this out, because we

00:22:59.110 --> 00:23:00.700 align:middle line:90%
did that in the 20th century.

00:23:00.700 --> 00:23:03.850 align:middle line:84%
We have all the solutions
to all the big problems.

00:23:03.850 --> 00:23:05.350 align:middle line:84%
We have all the
food we need to feed

00:23:05.350 --> 00:23:07.600 align:middle line:84%
every mouth of every child,
every woman, every man

00:23:07.600 --> 00:23:09.430 align:middle line:90%
on the face of the Earth.

00:23:09.430 --> 00:23:12.580 align:middle line:84%
We have the ability
to create energy,

00:23:12.580 --> 00:23:16.540 align:middle line:84%
free energy with zero greenhouse
gases and no fossil fuels.

00:23:16.540 --> 00:23:18.730 align:middle line:84%
And we've had that
for over 60 years.

00:23:18.730 --> 00:23:21.550 align:middle line:84%
We've already
determined that we know

00:23:21.550 --> 00:23:24.560 align:middle line:84%
how to build an economy based
upon sharing and cooperation.

00:23:24.560 --> 00:23:27.850 align:middle line:84%
Which is very different from
an economy of competition

00:23:27.850 --> 00:23:31.060 align:middle line:84%
and scarcity where one person
has what other people need

00:23:31.060 --> 00:23:32.437 align:middle line:90%
and they leverage that.

00:23:32.437 --> 00:23:34.270 align:middle line:84%
It's a very, very
different way of thinking.

00:23:34.270 --> 00:23:35.830 align:middle line:84%
We already have all
of these things.

00:23:35.830 --> 00:23:37.512 align:middle line:90%
Here's what's lacking.

00:23:37.512 --> 00:23:39.970 align:middle line:84%
People say to me, if we've got
all this stuff, where is it?

00:23:39.970 --> 00:23:41.650 align:middle line:90%
Why don't we see it now?

00:23:41.650 --> 00:23:43.960 align:middle line:84%
We're lacking the
leadership that

00:23:43.960 --> 00:23:49.060 align:middle line:84%
makes it a priority to implement
these things in our world.

00:23:49.060 --> 00:23:52.990 align:middle line:84%
We're lacking the leadership
that makes it a priority

00:23:52.990 --> 00:23:56.830 align:middle line:84%
to bring into our lives what
already exists in the world.

00:23:56.830 --> 00:24:00.040 align:middle line:84%
These things--
they already exist

00:24:00.040 --> 00:24:02.770 align:middle line:84%
and they're waiting to
be implemented-- however,

00:24:02.770 --> 00:24:04.390 align:middle line:90%
we have leadership.

00:24:04.390 --> 00:24:06.370 align:middle line:84%
And I'm not saying it's
the fault of any one

00:24:06.370 --> 00:24:07.420 align:middle line:90%
person or any nation.

00:24:07.420 --> 00:24:09.590 align:middle line:84%
I'm saying this is
a way of thinking.

00:24:09.590 --> 00:24:12.160 align:middle line:84%
And I think many of us as
individuals are guilty of this,

00:24:12.160 --> 00:24:13.510 align:middle line:90%
as well.

00:24:13.510 --> 00:24:16.540 align:middle line:90%
Because no one in the media--

00:24:16.540 --> 00:24:20.800 align:middle line:84%
the media, typically, has
never acknowledged that we're

00:24:20.800 --> 00:24:22.630 align:middle line:90%
going through this big change.

00:24:22.630 --> 00:24:27.250 align:middle line:84%
And so it's important for the
media to say at some point,

00:24:27.250 --> 00:24:31.370 align:middle line:84%
the world has changed and
we're living a new normal.

00:24:31.370 --> 00:24:34.150 align:middle line:84%
So without having
said that, so many

00:24:34.150 --> 00:24:36.730 align:middle line:84%
of us, consciously
and subconsciously,

00:24:36.730 --> 00:24:40.120 align:middle line:84%
are waiting for things
to get back to normal.

00:24:40.120 --> 00:24:42.400 align:middle line:84%
We're seeing these
extremes as a little speed

00:24:42.400 --> 00:24:44.500 align:middle line:84%
bump in the road
of life and we're

00:24:44.500 --> 00:24:46.430 align:middle line:84%
waiting for things
to settle down,

00:24:46.430 --> 00:24:49.450 align:middle line:84%
we're waiting for
the dust to settle.

00:24:49.450 --> 00:24:51.490 align:middle line:84%
The speed bump is
the new normal.

00:24:51.490 --> 00:24:54.580 align:middle line:84%
Volatility is the name of
the game for our lifetimes

00:24:54.580 --> 00:24:56.830 align:middle line:84%
and probably our
children's lifetimes,

00:24:56.830 --> 00:25:00.220 align:middle line:84%
because we're living the
transition of a global society.

00:25:00.220 --> 00:25:01.550 align:middle line:90%
It doesn't mean it's bad.

00:25:01.550 --> 00:25:06.850 align:middle line:84%
It just means if we are clinging
to the ideas, the old ideas

00:25:06.850 --> 00:25:10.030 align:middle line:84%
of a world that used to be and
were waiting for things to get

00:25:10.030 --> 00:25:15.280 align:middle line:84%
back to normal, there's no
room, emotionally, psychically,

00:25:15.280 --> 00:25:19.420 align:middle line:84%
there's no room to embrace the
new world that's already here.

00:25:19.420 --> 00:25:21.520 align:middle line:84%
And think about this
in your own life.

00:25:21.520 --> 00:25:23.470 align:middle line:84%
Think about this
with a relationship.

00:25:23.470 --> 00:25:27.010 align:middle line:84%
If you are filled to
the brim with the love

00:25:27.010 --> 00:25:31.270 align:middle line:84%
and the passion
of a new romance,

00:25:31.270 --> 00:25:35.290 align:middle line:84%
there is no room to
entertain another romance

00:25:35.290 --> 00:25:38.995 align:middle line:84%
because you're wired for the
one that's present in your life.

00:25:38.995 --> 00:25:42.340 align:middle line:84%
Now I'm using that as an example
because, in many respects,

00:25:42.340 --> 00:25:45.460 align:middle line:84%
the romance that we've had
with the world of the past,

00:25:45.460 --> 00:25:47.860 align:middle line:84%
if we are filled to
the brim with expecting

00:25:47.860 --> 00:25:49.990 align:middle line:84%
the climate, the weather
to behave a certain way,

00:25:49.990 --> 00:25:51.531 align:middle line:84%
for spring to start
on a certain day,

00:25:51.531 --> 00:25:53.320 align:middle line:84%
the rain to come
in a certain time,

00:25:53.320 --> 00:25:56.860 align:middle line:84%
for the economy to move
within certain boundaries,

00:25:56.860 --> 00:26:00.070 align:middle line:84%
if we're waiting for that
world, that world is gone.

00:26:00.070 --> 00:26:03.724 align:middle line:84%
And the new world now is
this world of volatility.

00:26:03.724 --> 00:26:05.140 align:middle line:84%
But the volatility
is where we can

00:26:05.140 --> 00:26:06.970 align:middle line:90%
embrace the new discoveries.

00:26:06.970 --> 00:26:08.590 align:middle line:90%
Bring in the new economy.

00:26:08.590 --> 00:26:10.070 align:middle line:84%
Bring in the new
forms of energy.

00:26:10.070 --> 00:26:11.204 align:middle line:90%
Bring in the new jobs.

00:26:11.204 --> 00:26:12.620 align:middle line:84%
Bring in the new
forms of healing.

00:26:12.620 --> 00:26:14.660 align:middle line:84%
Bring in the new forms
of communication.

00:26:14.660 --> 00:26:16.550 align:middle line:90%
It's all, already there.

00:26:16.550 --> 00:26:20.900 align:middle line:84%
We lack the leadership that is
willing to make it a priority

00:26:20.900 --> 00:26:26.090 align:middle line:84%
to bring these beautiful,
beautiful, amazing, powerful

00:26:26.090 --> 00:26:29.450 align:middle line:84%
discoveries to the people
of the Earth to give us

00:26:29.450 --> 00:26:33.830 align:middle line:84%
the quality, the healthy
lives, the quality of life

00:26:33.830 --> 00:26:35.510 align:middle line:90%
that we all know is possible.

00:26:35.510 --> 00:26:37.250 align:middle line:84%
So within that
quality of life we

00:26:37.250 --> 00:26:42.330 align:middle line:84%
can thrive, create, innovate,
and bring to the world

00:26:42.330 --> 00:26:43.280 align:middle line:90%
our heart's desire.

00:26:43.280 --> 00:26:45.620 align:middle line:84%
And that's the world we
all know is possible.

00:26:45.620 --> 00:26:47.780 align:middle line:90%
So what does that mean for us?

00:26:47.780 --> 00:26:50.480 align:middle line:84%
As long as we live in
communities, or nations

00:26:50.480 --> 00:26:54.890 align:middle line:84%
or societies where we choose to
elect people to represent us,

00:26:54.890 --> 00:26:57.440 align:middle line:84%
it's incumbent upon us
to hold those elected

00:26:57.440 --> 00:26:59.900 align:middle line:84%
officials accountable
to represent

00:26:59.900 --> 00:27:01.160 align:middle line:90%
our views and our values.

00:27:01.160 --> 00:27:04.200 align:middle line:84%
And when they don't, we need
to let them know about that.

00:27:04.200 --> 00:27:06.680 align:middle line:84%
So this is where the
process all come into play.

00:27:06.680 --> 00:27:08.526 align:middle line:84%
It brings in a lot
of ideas and it

00:27:08.526 --> 00:27:11.150 align:middle line:84%
touches on a lot of things I am
very passionate about because I

00:27:11.150 --> 00:27:13.590 align:middle line:90%
know the world that's possible.

00:27:13.590 --> 00:27:15.110 align:middle line:90%
And we're right there.

00:27:15.110 --> 00:27:17.640 align:middle line:84%
We're just, mm,
we're right there.

00:27:17.640 --> 00:27:19.470 align:middle line:84%
And we're going to see
it in this lifetime.

00:27:19.470 --> 00:27:21.120 align:middle line:90%
And I vote for a soft landing.

00:27:21.120 --> 00:27:24.940 align:middle line:90%


00:27:24.940 --> 00:27:27.910 align:middle line:84%
So when people ask
me about where we

00:27:27.910 --> 00:27:29.390 align:middle line:90%
are in this time in history--

00:27:29.390 --> 00:27:32.170 align:middle line:84%
and many people have
literally asked me,

00:27:32.170 --> 00:27:36.730 align:middle line:84%
how do we get out of
this mindset of scarcity?

00:27:36.730 --> 00:27:39.480 align:middle line:84%
This is one of those
places where the answer is

00:27:39.480 --> 00:27:43.240 align:middle line:84%
in the question, because
the idea of scarcity

00:27:43.240 --> 00:27:46.840 align:middle line:84%
is nothing more, nothing
less than a mindset.

00:27:46.840 --> 00:27:48.670 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't exist
in the world, it

00:27:48.670 --> 00:27:50.290 align:middle line:84%
exists in our
perception of what we're

00:27:50.290 --> 00:27:52.331 align:middle line:90%
willing to accept in the world.

00:27:52.331 --> 00:27:53.830 align:middle line:84%
Perhaps more
importantly, what we're

00:27:53.830 --> 00:27:55.870 align:middle line:90%
willing to accept of ourselves.

00:27:55.870 --> 00:27:59.350 align:middle line:84%
Every one of us is a being
that needs to create,

00:27:59.350 --> 00:28:03.400 align:middle line:84%
to express in our lives,
in our world in some way.

00:28:03.400 --> 00:28:05.170 align:middle line:84%
Our creations and
our expressions

00:28:05.170 --> 00:28:09.100 align:middle line:84%
are the fuel that give
meaning to our lives

00:28:09.100 --> 00:28:11.860 align:middle line:84%
and contribute in a
meaningful way to our society

00:28:11.860 --> 00:28:13.600 align:middle line:84%
and to our economy
if we're talking

00:28:13.600 --> 00:28:15.310 align:middle line:90%
about that specifically.

00:28:15.310 --> 00:28:17.380 align:middle line:84%
So when people have
asked me, I have never

00:28:17.380 --> 00:28:20.530 align:middle line:90%
felt a scarcity in my life.

00:28:20.530 --> 00:28:25.180 align:middle line:84%
Although, when I was young,
my father left our family.

00:28:25.180 --> 00:28:26.050 align:middle line:90%
We were broke.

00:28:26.050 --> 00:28:26.850 align:middle line:90%
We were in debt.

00:28:26.850 --> 00:28:29.110 align:middle line:84%
That means you're
broke and beyond broke.

00:28:29.110 --> 00:28:32.019 align:middle line:84%
We were so in debt, we lived in
government subsidized housing.

00:28:32.019 --> 00:28:34.060 align:middle line:84%
We moved every year, I
went to a different school

00:28:34.060 --> 00:28:37.420 align:middle line:84%
in some really
rough neighborhoods.

00:28:37.420 --> 00:28:40.990 align:middle line:84%
I never felt that
idea of scarcity,

00:28:40.990 --> 00:28:43.420 align:middle line:84%
because I always
had the opportunity

00:28:43.420 --> 00:28:46.880 align:middle line:90%
to make my life better.

00:28:46.880 --> 00:28:49.270 align:middle line:10%
I always had the
opportunity to find some way

00:28:49.270 --> 00:28:53.290 align:middle line:10%
to contribute doing something
that would benefit someone else

00:28:53.290 --> 00:28:55.420 align:middle line:10%
and benefit me, as well.

00:28:55.420 --> 00:28:57.100 align:middle line:90%
And I think this is the key.

00:28:57.100 --> 00:29:01.450 align:middle line:10%
If we're relying upon
our sense of abundance,

00:29:01.450 --> 00:29:03.460 align:middle line:10%
if we rely upon
the external world

00:29:03.460 --> 00:29:07.780 align:middle line:10%
to give that to us
emotionally and psychically,

00:29:07.780 --> 00:29:10.430 align:middle line:10%
it will show up in
our physical world.

00:29:10.430 --> 00:29:13.360 align:middle line:84%
So if we're relying
on the outer world

00:29:13.360 --> 00:29:18.670 align:middle line:84%
for our sense of well-being,
for our abundance,

00:29:18.670 --> 00:29:22.570 align:middle line:84%
and if we believe that it is
a right for us to have it,

00:29:22.570 --> 00:29:24.760 align:middle line:84%
we will be disappointed
continuously.

00:29:24.760 --> 00:29:27.100 align:middle line:84%
Because the universe
doesn't see it as a right,

00:29:27.100 --> 00:29:29.980 align:middle line:84%
it's an opportunity to
create for ourselves.

00:29:29.980 --> 00:29:34.000 align:middle line:84%
And when we recognize, when
we perceive the abundance

00:29:34.000 --> 00:29:35.470 align:middle line:90%
that is already present--

00:29:35.470 --> 00:29:37.420 align:middle line:90%
it's not just about money.

00:29:37.420 --> 00:29:39.070 align:middle line:84%
Money is simply an
energy and we're

00:29:39.070 --> 00:29:40.810 align:middle line:90%
talking about energy here--

00:29:40.810 --> 00:29:42.700 align:middle line:84%
when we begin to
see the abundance

00:29:42.700 --> 00:29:45.610 align:middle line:90%
that we have in our lives--

00:29:45.610 --> 00:29:47.020 align:middle line:84%
people say, count
your blessings.

00:29:47.020 --> 00:29:49.750 align:middle line:10%
And I give thanks of
gratitude the last thing

00:29:49.750 --> 00:29:51.730 align:middle line:10%
before I go to
sleep every night.

00:29:51.730 --> 00:29:54.115 align:middle line:84%
I give thanks for
the day that has been

00:29:54.115 --> 00:29:56.320 align:middle line:90%
and the day that has yet to be.

00:29:56.320 --> 00:29:58.570 align:middle line:84%
The day that has been,
I will go through

00:29:58.570 --> 00:30:01.390 align:middle line:84%
the highlights and important
things and the people

00:30:01.390 --> 00:30:03.580 align:middle line:90%
and what they shared with me.

00:30:03.580 --> 00:30:05.230 align:middle line:90%
How they made me feel.

00:30:05.230 --> 00:30:07.480 align:middle line:84%
What they offered
me in their stories.

00:30:07.480 --> 00:30:10.977 align:middle line:84%
What they offered me in the
ways that we've collaborated

00:30:10.977 --> 00:30:11.810 align:middle line:90%
and worked together.

00:30:11.810 --> 00:30:14.050 align:middle line:84%
I give thanks for every
one of those things.

00:30:14.050 --> 00:30:16.510 align:middle line:84%
And then I give thanks for
the day that is yet to be.

00:30:16.510 --> 00:30:21.820 align:middle line:84%
The day that will dawn
when I awake is full.

00:30:21.820 --> 00:30:24.970 align:middle line:84%
It is ripe, it is pregnant
with possibilities.

00:30:24.970 --> 00:30:26.830 align:middle line:84%
And every one of
those is a potential.

00:30:26.830 --> 00:30:29.000 align:middle line:90%
Abundance is a consciousness.

00:30:29.000 --> 00:30:30.520 align:middle line:90%
It's a state of being.

00:30:30.520 --> 00:30:32.740 align:middle line:84%
And my experience
is, as we embrace

00:30:32.740 --> 00:30:40.630 align:middle line:84%
that on the emotional level
and receive the abundance that

00:30:40.630 --> 00:30:44.620 align:middle line:84%
is offered to us in so
many ways every day,

00:30:44.620 --> 00:30:48.760 align:middle line:84%
that shows up in our economic
and our financial lives,

00:30:48.760 --> 00:30:49.560 align:middle line:90%
as well.

00:30:49.560 --> 00:30:50.800 align:middle line:90%
It has to.

00:30:50.800 --> 00:30:53.470 align:middle line:84%
And that's different than
simply going out and saying,

00:30:53.470 --> 00:30:55.420 align:middle line:90%
I need to make money.

00:30:55.420 --> 00:30:57.760 align:middle line:84%
Because that comes from
a place of lack saying,

00:30:57.760 --> 00:30:59.230 align:middle line:90%
I don't have any.

00:30:59.230 --> 00:31:01.090 align:middle line:84%
And this is where
I find people that

00:31:01.090 --> 00:31:02.629 align:middle line:90%
have the greatest unhappiness.

00:31:02.629 --> 00:31:04.420 align:middle line:84%
Because they'll always
compare what they're

00:31:04.420 --> 00:31:06.730 align:middle line:84%
doing to others around
them and they'll

00:31:06.730 --> 00:31:09.130 align:middle line:84%
always see themselves
as less than.

00:31:09.130 --> 00:31:12.580 align:middle line:84%
Perfect example-- I just had
someone recently say to me,

00:31:12.580 --> 00:31:14.110 align:middle line:84%
don't you think it
should be illegal

00:31:14.110 --> 00:31:16.830 align:middle line:84%
for people like Bill
Gates to make the money

00:31:16.830 --> 00:31:18.287 align:middle line:90%
that he has made?

00:31:18.287 --> 00:31:20.620 align:middle line:84%
And I surprise him with the
answer and my answer was no.

00:31:20.620 --> 00:31:22.990 align:middle line:84%
I don't think that and
here's the reason why.

00:31:22.990 --> 00:31:24.320 align:middle line:90%
Bill Gates is a brilliant man.

00:31:24.320 --> 00:31:27.070 align:middle line:84%
He had an idea that
changed the planet.

00:31:27.070 --> 00:31:29.972 align:middle line:84%
And he fought to
implement that idea

00:31:29.972 --> 00:31:31.180 align:middle line:90%
when it wasn't well-received.

00:31:31.180 --> 00:31:32.554 align:middle line:84%
And I was working
in the industry

00:31:32.554 --> 00:31:34.180 align:middle line:90%
when this was all happening.

00:31:34.180 --> 00:31:36.550 align:middle line:84%
He has empowered
hundreds and hundreds

00:31:36.550 --> 00:31:38.110 align:middle line:90%
of thousands of people.

00:31:38.110 --> 00:31:39.280 align:middle line:90%
Is he a wealthy man?

00:31:39.280 --> 00:31:40.080 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:31:40.080 --> 00:31:44.170 align:middle line:84%
And he has created hundreds
of other wealthy people, given

00:31:44.170 --> 00:31:47.560 align:middle line:84%
people jobs, new technologies
have spun off from the idea

00:31:47.560 --> 00:31:48.550 align:middle line:90%
that one man had.

00:31:48.550 --> 00:31:52.160 align:middle line:84%
Why would I ever want
to limit his abundance?

00:31:52.160 --> 00:31:54.880 align:middle line:84%
The same thing with Facebook,
the founder of Facebook.

00:31:54.880 --> 00:31:57.100 align:middle line:84%
Same thing with the
founder of Amazon.

00:31:57.100 --> 00:31:59.710 align:middle line:84%
There is a list of the
wealthiest people in the world.

00:31:59.710 --> 00:32:03.430 align:middle line:84%
In no way do I
think those people

00:32:03.430 --> 00:32:06.670 align:middle line:84%
should have been limited when
it comes to them expressing

00:32:06.670 --> 00:32:08.860 align:middle line:90%
their potential in the past.

00:32:08.860 --> 00:32:12.040 align:middle line:84%
When it comes to the nuts and
bolts of tax laws and things

00:32:12.040 --> 00:32:14.120 align:middle line:84%
like that, it's a
whole different story.

00:32:14.120 --> 00:32:16.870 align:middle line:84%
But the principle of what has
happened with them is they

00:32:16.870 --> 00:32:19.690 align:middle line:84%
were inspired, just
like you and I.

00:32:19.690 --> 00:32:22.780 align:middle line:84%
And they took that
inspiration and they made it

00:32:22.780 --> 00:32:24.600 align:middle line:90%
into something real.

00:32:24.600 --> 00:32:27.150 align:middle line:84%
And that reality has
changed our planet.

00:32:27.150 --> 00:32:28.260 align:middle line:90%
You can do that.

00:32:28.260 --> 00:32:29.250 align:middle line:90%
I can do that.

00:32:29.250 --> 00:32:30.780 align:middle line:90%
Together we can do it.

00:32:30.780 --> 00:32:32.700 align:middle line:84%
And when we begin looking
at things this way,

00:32:32.700 --> 00:32:40.090 align:middle line:84%
the idea of scarcity
simply becomes obsolete.

00:32:40.090 --> 00:32:43.860 align:middle line:84%
So as we come to the
close of this episode,

00:32:43.860 --> 00:32:49.110 align:middle line:84%
if there was a single word that
I could offer to you my viewing

00:32:49.110 --> 00:32:54.420 align:middle line:84%
audience that would embody my
sense for everything that we've

00:32:54.420 --> 00:32:57.120 align:middle line:84%
talked about that could give
us that sense of security

00:32:57.120 --> 00:32:58.890 align:middle line:84%
in a world of volatility
and uncertainty,

00:32:58.890 --> 00:33:00.130 align:middle line:90%
what would that be?

00:33:00.130 --> 00:33:02.130 align:middle line:84%
And when I ask myself
the same question,

00:33:02.130 --> 00:33:04.920 align:middle line:84%
the word that comes to me
just like that is honesty.

00:33:04.920 --> 00:33:08.310 align:middle line:84%
I think it's important that
we are honest with ourselves,

00:33:08.310 --> 00:33:11.400 align:middle line:84%
about the world that's at our
doorstep, about what we're up

00:33:11.400 --> 00:33:13.890 align:middle line:84%
against, individually
and collectively.

00:33:13.890 --> 00:33:17.650 align:middle line:84%
Honest, truthful, and factual
about what the new discoveries

00:33:17.650 --> 00:33:18.450 align:middle line:90%
are showing--

00:33:18.450 --> 00:33:20.880 align:middle line:84%
and that's why I've
created "Missing Links."

00:33:20.880 --> 00:33:23.460 align:middle line:84%
And honest with
ourselves about what

00:33:23.460 --> 00:33:27.260 align:middle line:84%
it takes to implement
this new world.

00:33:27.260 --> 00:33:29.280 align:middle line:84%
I am optimistic and
I'm also a realist.

00:33:29.280 --> 00:33:32.010 align:middle line:84%
I'm under no illusion that
it takes a lot of work

00:33:32.010 --> 00:33:36.240 align:middle line:84%
to shift the thinking within a
single generation of how we've

00:33:36.240 --> 00:33:38.430 align:middle line:84%
lived our lives and
what money means to us

00:33:38.430 --> 00:33:42.630 align:middle line:84%
and what savings and retirement
and education and energy

00:33:42.630 --> 00:33:44.010 align:middle line:90%
and all those things mean.

00:33:44.010 --> 00:33:45.710 align:middle line:90%
It's all changing right now.

00:33:45.710 --> 00:33:48.960 align:middle line:84%
I think it's exciting
but it takes work.

00:33:48.960 --> 00:33:52.350 align:middle line:84%
And as I've mentioned
previously in this episode,

00:33:52.350 --> 00:33:54.330 align:middle line:84%
the prophet Kahlil
Gibran said to us,

00:33:54.330 --> 00:33:56.220 align:middle line:90%
"work is our love made visible."

00:33:56.220 --> 00:33:58.950 align:middle line:84%
It takes a lot of work to
change the way we think.

00:33:58.950 --> 00:34:00.440 align:middle line:90%
I think we're worth it.

00:34:00.440 --> 00:34:02.560 align:middle line:10%
And I think this
world is worth it.

00:34:02.560 --> 00:34:04.830 align:middle line:10%
And I think it's worth the
work that goes into it.

00:34:04.830 --> 00:34:07.222 align:middle line:84%
Because that work is our
way of loving ourselves.

00:34:07.222 --> 00:34:09.180 align:middle line:84%
And loving the world, is
our love made visible.

00:34:09.180 --> 00:34:13.080 align:middle line:90%
