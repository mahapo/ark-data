>>GREGG BRADEN: This
is the way we think.

00:00:33.970 --> 00:00:36.122 align:middle line:84%
Like, we complete each
other's sentences.

00:00:36.122 --> 00:00:40.190 align:middle line:90%


00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:42.110 align:middle line:10%
Hello, my name's
Gregg Braden, and I

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:44.900 align:middle line:10%
want to welcome you to this
very special edition of Missing

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:45.780 align:middle line:10%
Links.

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:50.150 align:middle line:84%
Today, I am very blessed to
have with me a dear friend,

00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:52.970 align:middle line:84%
a colleague I've known for more
years than either one of us

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:54.080 align:middle line:90%
can count.

00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:56.060 align:middle line:84%
I've had the privilege
of touring the world

00:00:56.060 --> 00:00:59.690 align:middle line:84%
and speaking with this man on
every continent of the Earth

00:00:59.690 --> 00:01:02.330 align:middle line:84%
about the new science
that is overturning

00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:06.460 align:middle line:84%
150 years of scientific thinking
when it comes to you and me

00:01:06.460 --> 00:01:08.180 align:middle line:84%
and the way we think
about our bodies,

00:01:08.180 --> 00:01:10.970 align:middle line:84%
our relationship to the world,
to the past, to the future,

00:01:10.970 --> 00:01:12.690 align:middle line:90%
to one another.

00:01:12.690 --> 00:01:14.870 align:middle line:10%
We were recently
invited as a team

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:18.740 align:middle line:10%
to speak at the United Nations
in New York as the 2030

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:21.560 align:middle line:10%
developmental goals-- the new
Sustainable Development Goals--

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:23.030 align:middle line:10%
were being developed.

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:25.100 align:middle line:84%
And I want to share
with you a little bit

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:26.780 align:middle line:84%
about what happened
during that meeting

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:29.790 align:middle line:84%
and what it meant to us, what
we had the opportunity to share

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:30.790 align:middle line:90%
with the United Nations.

00:01:30.790 --> 00:01:33.442 align:middle line:84%
So Bruce Lipton, thank
you so much for being

00:01:33.442 --> 00:01:35.900 align:middle line:84%
with us on "Missing Links" and
welcome to the show tonight.

00:01:35.900 --> 00:01:36.920 align:middle line:84%
>>BRUCE LIPTON: Well,
thank you, Gregg.

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:39.050 align:middle line:10%
I certainly appreciate
being here with you

00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:40.380 align:middle line:10%
and this wonderful audience.

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:41.250 align:middle line:90%
Thank you very much.

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:42.350 align:middle line:84%
>>BRADEN: Oh you're
very, very welcome.

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:43.308 align:middle line:90%
I know we're both busy.

00:01:43.308 --> 00:01:46.070 align:middle line:84%
We're speaking at a conference
here in northern New Mexico

00:01:46.070 --> 00:01:49.315 align:middle line:84%
with people from 19 nations
are with us this weekend.

00:01:49.315 --> 00:01:50.690 align:middle line:84%
>>LIPTON: Our own
United Nations.

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:52.670 align:middle line:84%
>>BRADEN: Our own-- they are
our little United Nations,

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:54.337 align:middle line:84%
and we've had the
opportunity break away

00:01:54.337 --> 00:01:56.030 align:middle line:90%
and have this conversation.

00:01:56.030 --> 00:01:58.370 align:middle line:84%
And I think this is an
important conversation.

00:01:58.370 --> 00:02:00.057 align:middle line:84%
It's a little bit
behind the scenes

00:02:00.057 --> 00:02:01.640 align:middle line:84%
of what really
happened for you and I.

00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:05.960 align:middle line:84%
We were blessed to be
invited to speak to some very

00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:08.570 align:middle line:84%
specific groups as the
Sustainable Development

00:02:08.570 --> 00:02:10.520 align:middle line:90%
Goals were being developed.

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:12.860 align:middle line:84%
And you know, you and I
never really talked afterward

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:17.360 align:middle line:84%
about what that was all about
for you, how you felt about it,

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:18.702 align:middle line:90%
why you think it was important.

00:02:18.702 --> 00:02:20.910 align:middle line:84%
And I thought it might be
interesting to do that now.

00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:23.930 align:middle line:84%
So I'd like to just ask you--
when we had the opportunity

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:26.420 align:middle line:84%
to speak at the UN,
how did you feel

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:28.070 align:middle line:84%
about sharing the
new discoveries?

00:02:28.070 --> 00:02:30.740 align:middle line:84%
And did you feel that it was a
receptive audience that we had?

00:02:30.740 --> 00:02:32.330 align:middle line:84%
>>LIPTON: Well, first of
all, I enjoyed very much

00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:34.190 align:middle line:84%
the opportunity to give
them some new information,

00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:36.680 align:middle line:84%
because they're really
operating from outdated science.

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:39.830 align:middle line:84%
And how can you plan the
future if your whole background

00:02:39.830 --> 00:02:42.050 align:middle line:84%
is really not living up to
the current understanding

00:02:42.050 --> 00:02:43.020 align:middle line:90%
of the world.

00:02:43.020 --> 00:02:44.900 align:middle line:84%
So this gave us an
opportunity to give them

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:46.310 align:middle line:90%
some new information.

00:02:46.310 --> 00:02:48.300 align:middle line:84%
I felt they were
really very receptive.

00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:50.240 align:middle line:84%
Also very confused
about, well, this

00:02:50.240 --> 00:02:53.210 align:middle line:84%
is very different than their
normal operating procedure.

00:02:53.210 --> 00:02:55.550 align:middle line:84%
But for us, it was
really important

00:02:55.550 --> 00:02:58.520 align:middle line:84%
because the new science
reveals that we're

00:02:58.520 --> 00:03:01.350 align:middle line:84%
moving through an evolutionary
paradigm at this time,

00:03:01.350 --> 00:03:04.100 align:middle line:84%
and it's necessary
for an organization,

00:03:04.100 --> 00:03:06.860 align:middle line:84%
such as the United Nations,
to be fully informed

00:03:06.860 --> 00:03:09.680 align:middle line:84%
of this because how can
we successfully move

00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:12.350 align:middle line:84%
into the future on
problems that we've

00:03:12.350 --> 00:03:13.630 align:middle line:90%
been carrying from the past?

00:03:13.630 --> 00:03:16.460 align:middle line:84%
>>BRADEN: You know, I
was really encouraged,

00:03:16.460 --> 00:03:18.410 align:middle line:90%
first by the invitation--

00:03:18.410 --> 00:03:21.770 align:middle line:84%
and I'll just be very honest
with our listeners here.

00:03:21.770 --> 00:03:24.200 align:middle line:84%
The United Nations-- when
we talk about the UN,

00:03:24.200 --> 00:03:26.750 align:middle line:84%
it is not like there
is one specific UN.

00:03:26.750 --> 00:03:28.130 align:middle line:90%
There are UNs within UNs.

00:03:28.130 --> 00:03:30.890 align:middle line:84%
It's like a big company,
in some respects.

00:03:30.890 --> 00:03:33.500 align:middle line:84%
And there are some
really excited,

00:03:33.500 --> 00:03:35.420 align:middle line:84%
forward-thinking,
young people who

00:03:35.420 --> 00:03:38.510 align:middle line:84%
are very interested in
embracing the new ideas

00:03:38.510 --> 00:03:41.540 align:middle line:84%
and applying them to what we
see happening in the world

00:03:41.540 --> 00:03:43.020 align:middle line:90%
and where it's moving.

00:03:43.020 --> 00:03:44.810 align:middle line:84%
And there were some
other people there

00:03:44.810 --> 00:03:47.450 align:middle line:84%
that, I'm just going to use
the word a little reluctant

00:03:47.450 --> 00:03:51.200 align:middle line:84%
because the new discoveries that
you and I are talking about--

00:03:51.200 --> 00:03:54.960 align:middle line:84%
Bruce, they present such a
different way of thinking.

00:03:54.960 --> 00:03:56.360 align:middle line:90%
It's so different.

00:03:56.360 --> 00:03:58.910 align:middle line:84%
In a single lifetime,
the revolution

00:03:58.910 --> 00:04:01.580 align:middle line:84%
in the way we're being
invited to think--

00:04:01.580 --> 00:04:04.430 align:middle line:84%
we've asked science
to tell us who we are.

00:04:04.430 --> 00:04:07.100 align:middle line:84%
And for 150 years, since
the time of Charles Darwin,

00:04:07.100 --> 00:04:09.400 align:middle line:84%
science has been
revealing the deepest

00:04:09.400 --> 00:04:10.400 align:middle line:90%
truths of our existence.

00:04:10.400 --> 00:04:12.830 align:middle line:84%
And the question is,
now, are scientists

00:04:12.830 --> 00:04:15.500 align:middle line:84%
willing to embrace the truth
the science is revealing

00:04:15.500 --> 00:04:18.680 align:middle line:84%
and apply those
truths in the world

00:04:18.680 --> 00:04:21.095 align:middle line:84%
as we are moving forward with
organizations like the UN.

00:04:21.095 --> 00:04:22.970 align:middle line:84%
>>LIPTON: Well, it's
very difficult for them.

00:04:22.970 --> 00:04:25.070 align:middle line:84%
Because if you've had your
whole career and this is the way

00:04:25.070 --> 00:04:27.130 align:middle line:84%
you understood life and
you did research this way

00:04:27.130 --> 00:04:29.630 align:middle line:84%
and you did work this way and
then someone walks in the door

00:04:29.630 --> 00:04:32.445 align:middle line:84%
and goes, well, you know that's
not exactly the way it is.

00:04:32.445 --> 00:04:34.210 align:middle line:90%
It pulls the rug out from them.

00:04:34.210 --> 00:04:35.210 align:middle line:90%
They feel very insecure.

00:04:35.210 --> 00:04:37.838 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it was exactly like
this when quantum physics

00:04:37.838 --> 00:04:40.130 align:middle line:84%
was introduced to the world
because the only physicists

00:04:40.130 --> 00:04:41.430 align:middle line:90%
were Newtonian physicists.

00:04:41.430 --> 00:04:44.420 align:middle line:84%
Then imagine you had your whole
career, university professor,

00:04:44.420 --> 00:04:48.080 align:middle line:84%
research guy, and you walk in
one day and somebody says--

00:04:48.080 --> 00:04:50.720 align:middle line:84%
especially young guys,
because that's who they were--

00:04:50.720 --> 00:04:55.680 align:middle line:84%
says, well, your idea about the
universe is really incorrect.

00:04:55.680 --> 00:04:57.680 align:middle line:90%
And it's like, what?

00:04:57.680 --> 00:05:00.660 align:middle line:84%
So basically, there's
a lot of resistance

00:05:00.660 --> 00:05:02.970 align:middle line:84%
because if this is what
you've done your whole life,

00:05:02.970 --> 00:05:05.327 align:middle line:84%
it's not easy for some
people say, oh, OK,

00:05:05.327 --> 00:05:06.410 align:middle line:90%
let's drop what I've done.

00:05:06.410 --> 00:05:08.410 align:middle line:84%
And let's go on
a whole new tact.

00:05:08.410 --> 00:05:10.220 align:middle line:84%
>>BRADEN: Yeah, there
was some resistance.

00:05:10.220 --> 00:05:11.930 align:middle line:84%
You know what I found
really encouraging?

00:05:11.930 --> 00:05:13.880 align:middle line:84%
Well, I felt like it
was a little microcosm

00:05:13.880 --> 00:05:16.460 align:middle line:84%
of the world speaking
to the people

00:05:16.460 --> 00:05:18.680 align:middle line:84%
because there are so many
different and very unique

00:05:18.680 --> 00:05:19.870 align:middle line:90%
views.

00:05:19.870 --> 00:05:22.370 align:middle line:84%
And I think you know about what
I'm going to share with you.

00:05:22.370 --> 00:05:24.870 align:middle line:84%
While we were speaking-- we'd
already started the meetings--

00:05:24.870 --> 00:05:26.900 align:middle line:84%
the door opened in
the back of the room

00:05:26.900 --> 00:05:29.700 align:middle line:84%
and a few people filed in and
stood along the back wall.

00:05:29.700 --> 00:05:31.405 align:middle line:84%
They never sat down,
and then they left.

00:05:31.405 --> 00:05:33.530 align:middle line:84%
And you and I looked at
each other, and we thought,

00:05:33.530 --> 00:05:34.910 align:middle line:90%
what was that?

00:05:34.910 --> 00:05:36.860 align:middle line:84%
We didn't know until
after the meeting

00:05:36.860 --> 00:05:38.390 align:middle line:84%
that the Secretary
General of the UN

00:05:38.390 --> 00:05:41.727 align:middle line:90%
had sent a team to check us out.

00:05:41.727 --> 00:05:43.310 align:middle line:84%
They wanted to see
what we were saying

00:05:43.310 --> 00:05:47.180 align:middle line:84%
and where the relevance
may have fallen.

00:05:47.180 --> 00:05:49.730 align:middle line:84%
And we also found-- what
we heard afterward--

00:05:49.730 --> 00:05:53.510 align:middle line:84%
was that they turned on the
CCTV-- the closed circuit TVs--

00:05:53.510 --> 00:05:55.160 align:middle line:84%
in the UN complex
for people that

00:05:55.160 --> 00:05:57.050 align:middle line:84%
wanted to hear our
presentation who

00:05:57.050 --> 00:05:58.640 align:middle line:90%
were not in the room with us.

00:05:58.640 --> 00:06:00.210 align:middle line:84%
And I found that
really encouraging.

00:06:00.210 --> 00:06:01.260 align:middle line:90%
I was excited.

00:06:01.260 --> 00:06:03.660 align:middle line:84%
And I was encouraged to
know that that had happened.

00:06:03.660 --> 00:06:05.452 align:middle line:84%
And I think that's an
indication that there

00:06:05.452 --> 00:06:09.560 align:middle line:84%
is an openness for new
ideas that in my lifetime--

00:06:09.560 --> 00:06:13.070 align:middle line:84%
I went to school in
1950s, 60s, early 70s,

00:06:13.070 --> 00:06:15.590 align:middle line:84%
and I remember there was a time
when the science was taught,

00:06:15.590 --> 00:06:17.360 align:middle line:90%
it was so buttoned up.

00:06:17.360 --> 00:06:18.860 align:middle line:90%
It was so perfect.

00:06:18.860 --> 00:06:22.260 align:middle line:84%
It's like, this is the way it
is, and there was no question.

00:06:22.260 --> 00:06:24.680 align:middle line:84%
And now the new
discoveries are actually

00:06:24.680 --> 00:06:27.980 align:middle line:84%
opening the door
to deeper questions

00:06:27.980 --> 00:06:32.030 align:middle line:84%
than answering definitively many
of the questions of the past.

00:06:32.030 --> 00:06:34.550 align:middle line:84%
And that tells us that
we're on the precipice,

00:06:34.550 --> 00:06:37.220 align:middle line:84%
we're on the verge of a
very, very different way

00:06:37.220 --> 00:06:38.555 align:middle line:90%
of thinking-- a new paradigm--

00:06:38.555 --> 00:06:40.430 align:middle line:84%
and we're being forced
to do it because where

00:06:40.430 --> 00:06:41.880 align:middle line:90%
we are in the world right now.

00:06:41.880 --> 00:06:45.020 align:middle line:84%
The world is pushing us to the
very edge of who we believe

00:06:45.020 --> 00:06:47.840 align:middle line:84%
we are, and the old solutions,
based on the old ideas,

00:06:47.840 --> 00:06:49.490 align:middle line:84%
aren't working and
that's creating

00:06:49.490 --> 00:06:50.955 align:middle line:90%
the opening for the new ideas.

00:06:50.955 --> 00:06:52.580 align:middle line:10%
>>LIPTON: Let's face
a simple fact here

00:06:52.580 --> 00:06:56.360 align:middle line:10%
that right now, civilization
is facing the sixth mass

00:06:56.360 --> 00:06:57.920 align:middle line:10%
extinction of life
on this planet.

00:06:57.920 --> 00:07:00.290 align:middle line:10%
Five times in history,
life was thriving

00:07:00.290 --> 00:07:03.980 align:middle line:10%
and some event essentially
wiped out 79% of life.

00:07:03.980 --> 00:07:07.160 align:middle line:84%
Today, we're in those
numbers right now.

00:07:07.160 --> 00:07:09.205 align:middle line:84%
And what's more important
about it is science

00:07:09.205 --> 00:07:11.810 align:middle line:84%
has recognized that
it's human behavior that

00:07:11.810 --> 00:07:14.510 align:middle line:84%
is responsible for the
extinction that will actually

00:07:14.510 --> 00:07:15.522 align:middle line:90%
do us in.

00:07:15.522 --> 00:07:17.480 align:middle line:84%
And the significance
about that is very simple.

00:07:17.480 --> 00:07:20.105 align:middle line:84%
It says, if we want to survive,
then you cannot keep doing what

00:07:20.105 --> 00:07:20.940 align:middle line:90%
we've been doing.

00:07:20.940 --> 00:07:23.540 align:middle line:84%
So the old stories are
actually the problem,

00:07:23.540 --> 00:07:26.510 align:middle line:84%
and Einstein's quote, you
can't solve the problems

00:07:26.510 --> 00:07:28.610 align:middle line:84%
with the same thinking
that created the problems.

00:07:28.610 --> 00:07:31.670 align:middle line:84%
And fortunately,
you and I have been

00:07:31.670 --> 00:07:34.100 align:middle line:84%
at the leading edge
of a new science

00:07:34.100 --> 00:07:36.010 align:middle line:84%
and a new understanding
of the world.

00:07:36.010 --> 00:07:38.150 align:middle line:84%
And it's been really
great to lecture with you

00:07:38.150 --> 00:07:41.030 align:middle line:84%
and to go out, because
instead of lecturing

00:07:41.030 --> 00:07:44.060 align:middle line:84%
to our former colleagues,
it's really taking the message

00:07:44.060 --> 00:07:46.430 align:middle line:84%
and talking to the
public, because the public

00:07:46.430 --> 00:07:49.280 align:middle line:84%
is the one that really
needs this information.

00:07:49.280 --> 00:07:50.870 align:middle line:90%
Knowledge is power.

00:07:50.870 --> 00:07:52.745 align:middle line:84%
Lack of knowledge
is a lack of power.

00:07:52.745 --> 00:07:54.620 align:middle line:84%
And the knowledge that
they've been operating

00:07:54.620 --> 00:07:57.770 align:middle line:84%
from on the basic science,
that we always thought,

00:07:57.770 --> 00:08:01.730 align:middle line:84%
that was truth, turns out
to be flawed, so much flawed

00:08:01.730 --> 00:08:04.310 align:middle line:84%
that that's why we're
creating our own extinction,

00:08:04.310 --> 00:08:06.410 align:middle line:84%
because our belief
systems are flawed.

00:08:06.410 --> 00:08:08.630 align:middle line:84%
And now we have the
opportunity to go out and talk

00:08:08.630 --> 00:08:12.290 align:middle line:84%
to the public and offer them a
more empowering understanding

00:08:12.290 --> 00:08:14.330 align:middle line:84%
of life than the
conventional belief

00:08:14.330 --> 00:08:16.228 align:middle line:84%
that we're just victims
of circumstances.

00:08:16.228 --> 00:08:18.020 align:middle line:84%
>>BRADEN: So you and
I are both scientists,

00:08:18.020 --> 00:08:21.020 align:middle line:84%
and I think this is why
we received the invitation

00:08:21.020 --> 00:08:22.600 align:middle line:90%
in the way that we did.

00:08:22.600 --> 00:08:24.990 align:middle line:84%
You're a life
scientist, biologist.

00:08:24.990 --> 00:08:28.010 align:middle line:84%
I'm an earth scientist,
a geologist by degree.

00:08:28.010 --> 00:08:29.990 align:middle line:84%
And from our unique
perspectives,

00:08:29.990 --> 00:08:32.090 align:middle line:84%
although they're very
different sciences,

00:08:32.090 --> 00:08:34.340 align:middle line:84%
it's hard to draw a line
from one to the other

00:08:34.340 --> 00:08:36.320 align:middle line:90%
because they're so interrelated.

00:08:36.320 --> 00:08:41.390 align:middle line:84%
Both of them are involved
with cycles, cycles of time,

00:08:41.390 --> 00:08:43.260 align:middle line:90%
cycles of experience.

00:08:43.260 --> 00:08:45.680 align:middle line:84%
And you're talking to me about
this cycle, the extinction

00:08:45.680 --> 00:08:48.152 align:middle line:84%
cycle, that you're
talking about right now.

00:08:48.152 --> 00:08:49.610 align:middle line:84%
>>LIPTON: And it's
really important

00:08:49.610 --> 00:08:51.693 align:middle line:84%
that you brought up the
fact that, while the earth

00:08:51.693 --> 00:08:54.710 align:middle line:84%
science and life sciences
are coming together here,

00:08:54.710 --> 00:08:57.140 align:middle line:84%
the idea of a separation,
which was in some sense

00:08:57.140 --> 00:08:59.600 align:middle line:84%
based on the Newtonian physics
that there is a material

00:08:59.600 --> 00:09:01.430 align:middle line:84%
existence and an
energy existence,

00:09:01.430 --> 00:09:03.680 align:middle line:84%
and they don't
relate to each other.

00:09:03.680 --> 00:09:06.187 align:middle line:84%
Well, that's gone by the wayside
because quantum mechanics

00:09:06.187 --> 00:09:07.520 align:middle line:90%
revealed there's only one thing.

00:09:07.520 --> 00:09:09.727 align:middle line:84%
It's energy, and everything
is interconnected.

00:09:09.727 --> 00:09:11.310 align:middle line:84%
And when it comes
to Earth and humans,

00:09:11.310 --> 00:09:12.768 align:middle line:84%
this is really
profoundly important

00:09:12.768 --> 00:09:15.650 align:middle line:84%
because our evolution did
not happen by accident.

00:09:15.650 --> 00:09:17.670 align:middle line:90%
Our evolution was adaptation.

00:09:17.670 --> 00:09:19.790 align:middle line:84%
So as earth changes
were occurring,

00:09:19.790 --> 00:09:23.210 align:middle line:84%
biological organisms were
responding to the Earth

00:09:23.210 --> 00:09:27.030 align:middle line:84%
by adjusting the genetics of
the organism to sustain life.

00:09:27.030 --> 00:09:30.470 align:middle line:84%
So you can never separate
earth science from biology,

00:09:30.470 --> 00:09:33.650 align:middle line:84%
because that's one of the
primary sources of information

00:09:33.650 --> 00:09:35.698 align:middle line:90%
that controls our own biology.

00:09:35.698 --> 00:09:37.490 align:middle line:84%
>>BRADEN: What you're
saying about the past

00:09:37.490 --> 00:09:38.740 align:middle line:90%
is true in the present moment.

00:09:38.740 --> 00:09:40.370 align:middle line:90%
It's happening to us right now.

00:09:40.370 --> 00:09:42.860 align:middle line:84%
We are living this
rare convergence--

00:09:42.860 --> 00:09:44.600 align:middle line:84%
and I've talked about
it in this series--

00:09:44.600 --> 00:09:46.610 align:middle line:84%
this convergence
of natural rhythms

00:09:46.610 --> 00:09:51.453 align:middle line:84%
and natural cycles, any one
of which in and of themselves

00:09:51.453 --> 00:09:53.620 align:middle line:84%
would be enough to change
the way we think and live.

00:09:53.620 --> 00:09:56.480 align:middle line:84%
But the fact that at least
three of these cycles

00:09:56.480 --> 00:09:59.210 align:middle line:84%
are converging-- the climate
cycle, economic cycles,

00:09:59.210 --> 00:10:01.520 align:middle line:84%
and cycles of human
conflict, they're

00:10:01.520 --> 00:10:02.848 align:middle line:90%
all converging right now.

00:10:02.848 --> 00:10:04.640 align:middle line:84%
They're creating the
conditions that you're

00:10:04.640 --> 00:10:09.020 align:middle line:84%
talking about that drive
evolution, so the changes that

00:10:09.020 --> 00:10:11.180 align:middle line:84%
are being forced
upon us in the world.

00:10:11.180 --> 00:10:12.360 align:middle line:90%
Our world is changing.

00:10:12.360 --> 00:10:13.160 align:middle line:90%
We can't stop that.

00:10:13.160 --> 00:10:17.300 align:middle line:84%
We've got to either think and
live differently or resist

00:10:17.300 --> 00:10:19.550 align:middle line:84%
that change, and that's where
the struggle comes from.

00:10:19.550 --> 00:10:21.230 align:middle line:84%
>>LIPTON: Well, I
think resisting is

00:10:21.230 --> 00:10:22.770 align:middle line:90%
futile in this particular case.

00:10:22.770 --> 00:10:25.230 align:middle line:84%
The Earth is a lot bigger
than we are on this.

00:10:25.230 --> 00:10:28.340 align:middle line:84%
And while we have certainly
put our hand in the system

00:10:28.340 --> 00:10:30.085 align:middle line:84%
and messed it up
a bit, the Earth

00:10:30.085 --> 00:10:31.460 align:middle line:84%
is trying to get
us to come back.

00:10:31.460 --> 00:10:33.207 align:middle line:84%
It's giving us these
lessons that say,

00:10:33.207 --> 00:10:34.790 align:middle line:84%
if you don't learn
to live in harmony,

00:10:34.790 --> 00:10:37.310 align:middle line:84%
then you won't be here
either, because extinction

00:10:37.310 --> 00:10:38.720 align:middle line:90%
is going to affect all of us.

00:10:38.720 --> 00:10:41.150 align:middle line:84%
And we're not talking
1,000 years from now.

00:10:41.150 --> 00:10:42.900 align:middle line:90%
We're talking within a century.

00:10:42.900 --> 00:10:46.258 align:middle line:84%
And so it really is important
for people to wake up and say,

00:10:46.258 --> 00:10:48.050 align:middle line:84%
what have we done, and
why have we done it,

00:10:48.050 --> 00:10:49.508 align:middle line:84%
and is there a
better way to do it?

00:10:49.508 --> 00:10:52.910 align:middle line:84%
And this is why I enjoy
our collaboration,

00:10:52.910 --> 00:10:56.105 align:middle line:84%
because we offer answers to
those very vital questions.

00:10:56.105 --> 00:10:57.480 align:middle line:84%
>>BRADEN: When
you're presenting,

00:10:57.480 --> 00:11:00.590 align:middle line:84%
and you have such an
awesome way of being

00:11:00.590 --> 00:11:03.080 align:middle line:90%
very present with the audience.

00:11:03.080 --> 00:11:04.993 align:middle line:84%
Whether there are 5,000
people in the room

00:11:04.993 --> 00:11:06.410 align:middle line:84%
or there's 200
people in the room,

00:11:06.410 --> 00:11:09.743 align:middle line:84%
everybody feels like you
were there just for them.

00:11:09.743 --> 00:11:10.910 align:middle line:90%
>>LIPTON: Well, I am, Gregg.

00:11:10.910 --> 00:11:11.710 align:middle line:90%
You know why?

00:11:11.710 --> 00:11:15.200 align:middle line:84%
Because I was a teacher,
a professor in a medical

00:11:15.200 --> 00:11:18.590 align:middle line:84%
school teaching the old science
and living the old science.

00:11:18.590 --> 00:11:22.130 align:middle line:84%
And my lessons came not
from textbooks or anything.

00:11:22.130 --> 00:11:23.630 align:middle line:90%
They came directly from cells.

00:11:23.630 --> 00:11:29.060 align:middle line:84%
I was cloning stem
cells 52 years ago now.

00:11:29.060 --> 00:11:31.650 align:middle line:84%
But the relevance about that
is by studying the cells,

00:11:31.650 --> 00:11:33.860 align:middle line:84%
I really learned
another way of life.

00:11:33.860 --> 00:11:35.540 align:middle line:90%
They taught me.

00:11:35.540 --> 00:11:38.210 align:middle line:84%
And the relevance about
that is when I applied it,

00:11:38.210 --> 00:11:40.020 align:middle line:90%
my life completely changed.

00:11:40.020 --> 00:11:43.400 align:middle line:84%
So I let go of the concept that
we're victims of our genetics,

00:11:43.400 --> 00:11:46.280 align:middle line:84%
let's say, or victims of
world changes and all that.

00:11:46.280 --> 00:11:47.570 align:middle line:90%
We are actually creators.

00:11:47.570 --> 00:11:50.410 align:middle line:84%
And this is really the principle
that quantum physics leaves us

00:11:50.410 --> 00:11:51.210 align:middle line:90%
with.

00:11:51.210 --> 00:11:54.800 align:middle line:84%
It recognizes that
mind is really

00:11:54.800 --> 00:11:56.325 align:middle line:84%
the source of all
of this creation,

00:11:56.325 --> 00:11:58.580 align:middle line:84%
and if we don't like
the creation, then

00:11:58.580 --> 00:12:01.100 align:middle line:84%
rather than going out and
changing the creation,

00:12:01.100 --> 00:12:04.280 align:middle line:84%
we really have to go back
inside and change the mind.

00:12:04.280 --> 00:12:05.930 align:middle line:84%
And this is, well,
all empowering,

00:12:05.930 --> 00:12:08.240 align:middle line:84%
because it means that an
individual doesn't have

00:12:08.240 --> 00:12:09.920 align:middle line:90%
to go out and fight the world.

00:12:09.920 --> 00:12:13.250 align:middle line:84%
They just have to learn how
to change their consciousness

00:12:13.250 --> 00:12:15.510 align:middle line:84%
to accommodate a
better, healthier life.

00:12:15.510 --> 00:12:17.695 align:middle line:84%
>>BRADEN: So you're
touching on some things.

00:12:17.695 --> 00:12:19.695 align:middle line:84%
When I'm sitting in that
audience listening you,

00:12:19.695 --> 00:12:22.845 align:middle line:84%
you do such a beautiful
job of illustrating

00:12:22.845 --> 00:12:23.720 align:middle line:90%
some of the concepts.

00:12:23.720 --> 00:12:24.680 align:middle line:90%
You're covering a lot of ground.

00:12:24.680 --> 00:12:25.940 align:middle line:90%
We both are right now.

00:12:25.940 --> 00:12:28.320 align:middle line:84%
But I want to ask you
a couple of specifics

00:12:28.320 --> 00:12:32.100 align:middle line:84%
just so our viewers have a
sense of precisely what you're

00:12:32.100 --> 00:12:32.900 align:middle line:90%
talking about.

00:12:32.900 --> 00:12:34.490 align:middle line:84%
So I'm going to take
about a half a step back.

00:12:34.490 --> 00:12:35.290 align:middle line:90%
>>LIPTON: OK.

00:12:35.290 --> 00:12:37.790 align:middle line:84%
>>BRADEN: When you
talked about the impact

00:12:37.790 --> 00:12:41.180 align:middle line:84%
that humans are having
upon the earth right now,

00:12:41.180 --> 00:12:44.450 align:middle line:84%
you give a statistic
for the amount of life

00:12:44.450 --> 00:12:46.820 align:middle line:84%
that has disappeared
in our lifetimes,

00:12:46.820 --> 00:12:49.280 align:middle line:84%
and it is a mind
blowing statistic.

00:12:49.280 --> 00:12:52.600 align:middle line:84%
I watch people in the audience
when they hear this number.

00:12:52.600 --> 00:12:53.990 align:middle line:90%
Nobody's talking about this.

00:12:53.990 --> 00:12:55.150 align:middle line:90%
They can't believe it.

00:12:55.150 --> 00:12:56.540 align:middle line:84%
And I wonder if you'd
like to share that.

00:12:56.540 --> 00:12:58.498 align:middle line:84%
>>LIPTON: Well, I would,
because I think we all

00:12:58.498 --> 00:13:00.140 align:middle line:90%
have to wake up to this fact.

00:13:00.140 --> 00:13:02.780 align:middle line:84%
In 1970, the World
Wildlife Foundation

00:13:02.780 --> 00:13:06.320 align:middle line:84%
took a survey of how many
animals are on planet Earth.

00:13:06.320 --> 00:13:10.110 align:middle line:84%
They just completed a second
one of those two years ago,

00:13:10.110 --> 00:13:15.770 align:middle line:84%
and at that point, 62% of the
total animal population in 1970

00:13:15.770 --> 00:13:17.010 align:middle line:90%
had disappeared.

00:13:17.010 --> 00:13:19.880 align:middle line:84%
So there's about one third
of the animals left just

00:13:19.880 --> 00:13:21.920 align:middle line:90%
since 1970.

00:13:21.920 --> 00:13:24.530 align:middle line:84%
And the reality about
that is that not

00:13:24.530 --> 00:13:26.660 align:middle line:84%
only are the animals on
the earth being infected,

00:13:26.660 --> 00:13:28.910 align:middle line:84%
science has also recognized
that there will be

00:13:28.910 --> 00:13:31.740 align:middle line:90%
no fish in the ocean in 2048.

00:13:31.740 --> 00:13:34.460 align:middle line:84%
Now, that's not a
million years from now.

00:13:34.460 --> 00:13:36.500 align:middle line:84%
My own kids will be
living on a planet

00:13:36.500 --> 00:13:40.190 align:middle line:84%
where there's no fish because
overfishing, destroying

00:13:40.190 --> 00:13:43.180 align:middle line:84%
breeding grounds, and
especially polluting the water

00:13:43.180 --> 00:13:45.560 align:middle line:90%
is killing the ocean.

00:13:45.560 --> 00:13:48.683 align:middle line:84%
When the ocean's dead, for
sure we're on the slab next.

00:13:48.683 --> 00:13:50.725 align:middle line:84%
>>BRADEN: No, that's where
the food chain begins.

00:13:50.725 --> 00:13:51.860 align:middle line:84%
So I just want to
clarify, when you

00:13:51.860 --> 00:13:54.120 align:middle line:84%
say one third of the life,
that includes the ocean

00:13:54.120 --> 00:13:54.920 align:middle line:90%
life as well?

00:13:54.920 --> 00:13:55.450 align:middle line:90%
One third of--

00:13:55.450 --> 00:13:56.950 align:middle line:84%
>>LIPTON: We've
lost more than that.

00:13:56.950 --> 00:13:59.435 align:middle line:84%
We've lost 90% of the
ocean life since 1950.

00:13:59.435 --> 00:14:00.560 align:middle line:90%
>>BRADEN: In our lifetimes?

00:14:00.560 --> 00:14:01.370 align:middle line:90%
>>LIPTON: In our lifetime.

00:14:01.370 --> 00:14:02.670 align:middle line:84%
>>BRADEN: That
just blows me away.

00:14:02.670 --> 00:14:04.070 align:middle line:84%
I mean, that's a mind
boggling statistic.

00:14:04.070 --> 00:14:04.550 align:middle line:90%
That's unsustainable.

00:14:04.550 --> 00:14:06.717 align:middle line:84%
>>LIPTON: When you were
young, you maybe even on TV,

00:14:06.717 --> 00:14:08.845 align:middle line:84%
they'd always have big
fishing expeditions.

00:14:08.845 --> 00:14:10.220 align:middle line:84%
They go out there,
and they catch

00:14:10.220 --> 00:14:14.082 align:middle line:84%
these big hammerhead sharks
and these big swordfish ones

00:14:14.082 --> 00:14:15.290 align:middle line:90%
and all these strange things.

00:14:15.290 --> 00:14:17.130 align:middle line:84%
It's like you can't
catch them now.

00:14:17.130 --> 00:14:18.130 align:middle line:90%
We can't even find them.

00:14:18.130 --> 00:14:19.890 align:middle line:84%
>>BRADEN: Yeah, it
is hard to find them.

00:14:19.890 --> 00:14:21.740 align:middle line:84%
So the next thing that
I wanted to clarify

00:14:21.740 --> 00:14:25.050 align:middle line:84%
was when you were talking about
the work that you were doing.

00:14:25.050 --> 00:14:28.190 align:middle line:84%
And I really want our
viewers to understand this.

00:14:28.190 --> 00:14:31.250 align:middle line:84%
Bruce Lipton was in the
laboratory performing

00:14:31.250 --> 00:14:37.550 align:middle line:84%
experiments over 50 years ago
that were discounted in his day

00:14:37.550 --> 00:14:39.590 align:middle line:84%
and now are the foundation
for the new science

00:14:39.590 --> 00:14:41.180 align:middle line:90%
that we call epigenetics.

00:14:41.180 --> 00:14:45.620 align:middle line:84%
Epigenetics, where the
environment of a cell

00:14:45.620 --> 00:14:48.230 align:middle line:84%
determines how that
cell expresses itself.

00:14:48.230 --> 00:14:49.370 align:middle line:90%
And you were--

00:14:49.370 --> 00:14:51.560 align:middle line:84%
I've seen the publications,
peer-reviewed scientific

00:14:51.560 --> 00:14:52.360 align:middle line:90%
journals.

00:14:52.360 --> 00:14:53.777 align:middle line:84%
So can you talk
to me a little bit

00:14:53.777 --> 00:14:55.400 align:middle line:84%
about what you learned
from the cells.

00:14:55.400 --> 00:14:56.260 align:middle line:90%
You alluded to this.

00:14:56.260 --> 00:14:59.920 align:middle line:84%
What did the cells teach
you in the Petri dish,

00:14:59.920 --> 00:15:02.960 align:middle line:84%
and how do we apply that to what
we're doing in our world today?

00:15:02.960 --> 00:15:04.960 align:middle line:84%
>>LIPTON: Well, the first
thing, let's start off

00:15:04.960 --> 00:15:07.130 align:middle line:84%
with what I was teaching
students in school

00:15:07.130 --> 00:15:07.930 align:middle line:90%
at that time.

00:15:07.930 --> 00:15:09.597 align:middle line:84%
And I was teaching
them a concept called

00:15:09.597 --> 00:15:11.830 align:middle line:84%
genetic determinism,
which is a concept that

00:15:11.830 --> 00:15:14.500 align:middle line:84%
says your genes can
determine the character

00:15:14.500 --> 00:15:15.633 align:middle line:90%
and quality of your life.

00:15:15.633 --> 00:15:17.800 align:middle line:84%
So everybody's bought into
that, and matter of fact,

00:15:17.800 --> 00:15:19.390 align:middle line:84%
they're still
teaching the same idea

00:15:19.390 --> 00:15:21.650 align:middle line:84%
in elementary levels
and high school levels.

00:15:21.650 --> 00:15:24.520 align:middle line:84%
But when you go up in college,
that sort of disappears,

00:15:24.520 --> 00:15:26.530 align:middle line:84%
because at a higher
understanding,

00:15:26.530 --> 00:15:28.120 align:middle line:84%
genetic determinism
is not valid.

00:15:28.120 --> 00:15:30.280 align:middle line:90%
Genes do not control us.

00:15:30.280 --> 00:15:33.220 align:middle line:84%
The whole belief that
genes turn on and off

00:15:33.220 --> 00:15:34.810 align:middle line:90%
is a false understanding.

00:15:34.810 --> 00:15:36.790 align:middle line:84%
Genes are blueprints
just like a blueprint

00:15:36.790 --> 00:15:37.990 align:middle line:90%
in an architect's office.

00:15:37.990 --> 00:15:41.020 align:middle line:84%
You go in an architects
office and ask her,

00:15:41.020 --> 00:15:42.940 align:middle line:84%
is your blueprint
on or off, and she'd

00:15:42.940 --> 00:15:44.902 align:middle line:90%
look at you like you're crazy.

00:15:44.902 --> 00:15:47.110 align:middle line:84%
Well, people talk about the
genes turning on and off,

00:15:47.110 --> 00:15:49.342 align:middle line:84%
and I go, that's
completely false.

00:15:49.342 --> 00:15:51.550 align:middle line:84%
So this is really hard,
because almost everyone, when

00:15:51.550 --> 00:15:52.690 align:middle line:84%
you go out in the
street, goes, oh yeah,

00:15:52.690 --> 00:15:54.190 align:middle line:84%
a gene turned on
and gave me cancer.

00:15:54.190 --> 00:15:55.367 align:middle line:90%
A gene did this.

00:15:55.367 --> 00:15:57.700 align:middle line:84%
And I say, well, what's the
consequence of that thought?

00:15:57.700 --> 00:15:58.825 align:middle line:90%
And very simply, it's this.

00:15:58.825 --> 00:16:01.345 align:middle line:84%
As far as we know, we didn't
pick the genes we came with.

00:16:01.345 --> 00:16:03.220 align:middle line:84%
If we don't like the
characteristics we have,

00:16:03.220 --> 00:16:05.560 align:middle line:84%
you can't change
the genes anyway.

00:16:05.560 --> 00:16:07.600 align:middle line:84%
And the belief that
genes turn on and off

00:16:07.600 --> 00:16:10.330 align:middle line:84%
takes you out of the
equation, and that leaves us

00:16:10.330 --> 00:16:12.722 align:middle line:84%
as victims, victims
of our heredity.

00:16:12.722 --> 00:16:14.680 align:middle line:84%
Oh my god, there's cancer
running in my family,

00:16:14.680 --> 00:16:15.823 align:middle line:90%
or something like that.

00:16:15.823 --> 00:16:17.740 align:middle line:84%
And we believe the genes
are going to do this.

00:16:17.740 --> 00:16:19.570 align:middle line:90%
So that's what I'm teaching.

00:16:19.570 --> 00:16:21.070 align:middle line:84%
But in the laboratory,
I was cloning

00:16:21.070 --> 00:16:23.608 align:middle line:84%
stem cells, which are the
equivalent of embryonic cells.

00:16:23.608 --> 00:16:24.900 align:middle line:90%
>>BRADEN: This is in the 1960s?

00:16:24.900 --> 00:16:25.660 align:middle line:90%
>>LIPTON: '67.

00:16:25.660 --> 00:16:27.520 align:middle line:84%
>>BRADEN: You were
cloning stem cells in '67?

00:16:27.520 --> 00:16:28.320 align:middle line:90%
>>LIPTON: Yeah.

00:16:28.320 --> 00:16:30.340 align:middle line:84%
I think they were
probably not more than 20

00:16:30.340 --> 00:16:31.990 align:middle line:84%
or 30 people in
the world that knew

00:16:31.990 --> 00:16:33.642 align:middle line:90%
what a stem cell was in 1967.

00:16:33.642 --> 00:16:36.100 align:middle line:84%
I just happened to be in the
right place at the right time.

00:16:36.100 --> 00:16:37.750 align:middle line:84%
A stem cell is an
embryonic cell.

00:16:37.750 --> 00:16:39.490 align:middle line:84%
And I put one stem
cell in a dish,

00:16:39.490 --> 00:16:41.060 align:middle line:84%
and then it divides
every 10 hours.

00:16:41.060 --> 00:16:43.180 align:middle line:84%
So first there's one, then
two, four, eight, doubling,

00:16:43.180 --> 00:16:43.980 align:middle line:90%
doubling.

00:16:43.980 --> 00:16:46.420 align:middle line:84%
At the end of week, 30,000
cells in the Petri dish,

00:16:46.420 --> 00:16:49.670 align:middle line:84%
but the most important fact is
they all came from one parent.

00:16:49.670 --> 00:16:52.840 align:middle line:84%
So that meant I had 30,000
genetically identical cells.

00:16:52.840 --> 00:16:53.837 align:middle line:90%
>>BRADEN: OK.

00:16:53.837 --> 00:16:56.170 align:middle line:84%
>>LIPTON: And we grow cells
in a laboratory in something

00:16:56.170 --> 00:16:58.300 align:middle line:84%
called culture medium,
and culture medium is

00:16:58.300 --> 00:17:00.320 align:middle line:90%
a laboratory version of blood.

00:17:00.320 --> 00:17:03.070 align:middle line:84%
So if I grow human cells, I say,
what is human blood made out

00:17:03.070 --> 00:17:03.610 align:middle line:90%
of?

00:17:03.610 --> 00:17:05.693 align:middle line:84%
And then I take those
ingredients, synthesize them

00:17:05.693 --> 00:17:08.050 align:middle line:84%
in a lab, and feed
cells culture medium.

00:17:08.050 --> 00:17:10.240 align:middle line:84%
But since I create
the culture medium,

00:17:10.240 --> 00:17:12.579 align:middle line:84%
I can change some of the
composition a little tiny bit.

00:17:12.579 --> 00:17:14.610 align:middle line:84%
So I created three
slightly different versions

00:17:14.610 --> 00:17:15.410 align:middle line:90%
of culture medium.

00:17:15.410 --> 00:17:17.349 align:middle line:84%
Slightly different
chemistry, OK?

00:17:17.349 --> 00:17:21.200 align:middle line:84%
But the culture medium is the
environment for the cells.

00:17:21.200 --> 00:17:24.290 align:middle line:84%
I fed these dishes, and they all
had genetically identical cells

00:17:24.290 --> 00:17:27.079 align:middle line:84%
in them because I split up
the 30,000 into three dishes.

00:17:27.079 --> 00:17:29.630 align:middle line:84%
But each one had a slightly
different environment

00:17:29.630 --> 00:17:31.880 align:middle line:84%
because I had slightly
different culture medium.

00:17:31.880 --> 00:17:33.530 align:middle line:84%
In one dish, the
cells formed muscle.

00:17:33.530 --> 00:17:35.780 align:middle line:84%
The other dish, they formed
bone, and in a third dish,

00:17:35.780 --> 00:17:37.550 align:middle line:90%
the cells formed fat cells.

00:17:37.550 --> 00:17:39.470 align:middle line:84%
Well, the profound
important question

00:17:39.470 --> 00:17:42.245 align:middle line:84%
is, well, what controls
the fate of the cells?

00:17:42.245 --> 00:17:44.495 align:middle line:84%
And we've always said genes
control the fate of cells.

00:17:44.495 --> 00:17:46.490 align:middle line:84%
And I go, yeah, but
all of these cells

00:17:46.490 --> 00:17:47.615 align:middle line:90%
were genetically identical.

00:17:47.615 --> 00:17:49.615 align:middle line:84%
So all of a sudden, it's
like, well, they didn't

00:17:49.615 --> 00:17:50.990 align:middle line:90%
have different genes in them.

00:17:50.990 --> 00:17:52.340 align:middle line:90%
They had different environments.

00:17:52.340 --> 00:17:53.140 align:middle line:90%
>>BRADEN: Right.

00:17:53.140 --> 00:17:56.600 align:middle line:84%
>>LIPTON: And the environment
was interacting with the cell

00:17:56.600 --> 00:17:58.968 align:middle line:84%
and selecting gene
activity in the cell.

00:17:58.968 --> 00:18:01.010 align:middle line:84%
And all of a sudden, this
says, my goodness, then

00:18:01.010 --> 00:18:02.720 align:middle line:84%
the belief that the
genes inside of us

00:18:02.720 --> 00:18:04.390 align:middle line:84%
are controlling us
from inside-- it

00:18:04.390 --> 00:18:08.810 align:middle line:84%
says no, it's our environment
and our perceptions,

00:18:08.810 --> 00:18:12.500 align:middle line:84%
because the blood in our body
is the original culture medium.

00:18:12.500 --> 00:18:14.810 align:middle line:84%
And our body, when
we look in the mirror

00:18:14.810 --> 00:18:17.900 align:middle line:84%
and see one living entity,
I go, that's an illusion,

00:18:17.900 --> 00:18:21.140 align:middle line:84%
because a body's made
out of 50 trillion cells.

00:18:21.140 --> 00:18:23.552 align:middle line:84%
So a body, by definition,
is a community of cells,

00:18:23.552 --> 00:18:25.010 align:middle line:84%
because they're
the living element.

00:18:25.010 --> 00:18:27.558 align:middle line:84%
The body is represented
by the community.

00:18:27.558 --> 00:18:28.850 align:middle line:90%
>>BRADEN: We're the Petri dish?

00:18:28.850 --> 00:18:31.130 align:middle line:84%
>>LIPTON: We are a skin
covered Petri dish,

00:18:31.130 --> 00:18:33.182 align:middle line:84%
and we have original
culture medium called blood.

00:18:33.182 --> 00:18:34.640 align:middle line:84%
I say, it doesn't
make a difference

00:18:34.640 --> 00:18:38.300 align:middle line:84%
if the cell is in a plastic
dish or in a skin covered dish.

00:18:38.300 --> 00:18:40.760 align:middle line:84%
The fate of the cell is not
controlled by its genes,

00:18:40.760 --> 00:18:43.290 align:middle line:84%
it's controlled by the
information in the environment.

00:18:43.290 --> 00:18:46.250 align:middle line:84%
Well, in my skin covered
Petri dish, of course,

00:18:46.250 --> 00:18:48.260 align:middle line:84%
the original culture
medium is blood.

00:18:48.260 --> 00:18:49.710 align:middle line:84%
And then the
question comes, well,

00:18:49.710 --> 00:18:51.590 align:middle line:84%
if the chemistry of the
blood is controlling

00:18:51.590 --> 00:18:53.270 align:middle line:84%
the fate of the
cells, what controls

00:18:53.270 --> 00:18:54.395 align:middle line:90%
the chemistry of the blood?

00:18:54.395 --> 00:18:55.850 align:middle line:90%
Well, you take it up one notch.

00:18:55.850 --> 00:18:57.780 align:middle line:90%
The brain is the chemist.

00:18:57.780 --> 00:18:59.630 align:middle line:84%
And then I go, OK, so
what chemicals should

00:18:59.630 --> 00:19:01.067 align:middle line:90%
the brain put into the blood?

00:19:01.067 --> 00:19:02.900 align:middle line:84%
And all of a sudden,
we go up one more notch

00:19:02.900 --> 00:19:07.070 align:middle line:84%
and recognize whatever
picture we have in our mind,

00:19:07.070 --> 00:19:10.267 align:middle line:84%
it is translated by the brain
into complementary chemistry.

00:19:10.267 --> 00:19:11.725 align:middle line:84%
>>BRADEN: OK, so
this is important.

00:19:11.725 --> 00:19:12.980 align:middle line:84%
And I'm going to
bring us back to--

00:19:12.980 --> 00:19:14.140 align:middle line:84%
>>LIPTON: I think
it's important, yeah.

00:19:14.140 --> 00:19:15.265 align:middle line:90%
>>BRADEN: --where it began.

00:19:15.265 --> 00:19:17.270 align:middle line:84%
We are living a convergence
of these cycles.

00:19:17.270 --> 00:19:18.980 align:middle line:90%
The world is changing.

00:19:18.980 --> 00:19:20.600 align:middle line:84%
And your experiments
in the laboratory

00:19:20.600 --> 00:19:25.730 align:middle line:84%
were showing you that the
environment is what determines

00:19:25.730 --> 00:19:28.370 align:middle line:90%
how we respond to the change.

00:19:28.370 --> 00:19:31.820 align:middle line:84%
What we now know is that our
perceptions of the change

00:19:31.820 --> 00:19:33.920 align:middle line:84%
are what's driving
the shift that we

00:19:33.920 --> 00:19:36.537 align:middle line:84%
see at the genetic level,
at the level of the genes.

00:19:36.537 --> 00:19:37.430 align:middle line:90%
>>LIPTON: Exactly.

00:19:37.430 --> 00:19:40.040 align:middle line:84%
>>BRADEN: So here
we are at the UN.

00:19:40.040 --> 00:19:41.780 align:middle line:84%
We're sharing these
new discoveries.

00:19:41.780 --> 00:19:44.360 align:middle line:84%
We're talking about
converging cycles.

00:19:44.360 --> 00:19:46.460 align:middle line:84%
And they're asking for
input because they're

00:19:46.460 --> 00:19:48.770 align:middle line:84%
developing the
sustainable development

00:19:48.770 --> 00:19:51.390 align:middle line:90%
goals through the year 2030.

00:19:51.390 --> 00:19:53.870 align:middle line:90%
So what can we learn?

00:19:53.870 --> 00:19:59.030 align:middle line:84%
What is the lesson that we
can learn from the cells?

00:19:59.030 --> 00:20:01.160 align:middle line:84%
At the deepest
level of life, what

00:20:01.160 --> 00:20:04.340 align:middle line:84%
is the wisdom that they
preserve and show us every day,

00:20:04.340 --> 00:20:06.440 align:middle line:84%
if we have the wisdom
to recognize it,

00:20:06.440 --> 00:20:08.690 align:middle line:84%
that we can apply to
this time in our lives

00:20:08.690 --> 00:20:10.610 align:middle line:84%
and the convergence
of these cycles

00:20:10.610 --> 00:20:12.830 align:middle line:84%
so we can thrive
in a healthy way

00:20:12.830 --> 00:20:14.630 align:middle line:90%
and move through these changes?

00:20:14.630 --> 00:20:16.630 align:middle line:84%
>>LIPTON: Well, the most
important understanding

00:20:16.630 --> 00:20:18.890 align:middle line:84%
is that over evolution, it's
all been driven by what's

00:20:18.890 --> 00:20:20.540 align:middle line:90%
going on in the environment.

00:20:20.540 --> 00:20:22.500 align:middle line:84%
And we came from a very
healthy environment.

00:20:22.500 --> 00:20:24.500 align:middle line:84%
So the whole web of life
grew up in something we

00:20:24.500 --> 00:20:26.840 align:middle line:90%
called the Garden, so to speak.

00:20:26.840 --> 00:20:30.290 align:middle line:84%
And the reality is we've
lost our understanding of why

00:20:30.290 --> 00:20:31.490 align:middle line:90%
we were here.

00:20:31.490 --> 00:20:32.990 align:middle line:84%
We have this belief
that we got here

00:20:32.990 --> 00:20:35.960 align:middle line:84%
by accidents of genetic
mutation, the Darwinian theory.

00:20:35.960 --> 00:20:37.910 align:middle line:84%
Oh, a gene changed,
and they went off

00:20:37.910 --> 00:20:39.420 align:middle line:90%
in a different direction.

00:20:39.420 --> 00:20:42.530 align:middle line:84%
The belief that these
gene changes occur

00:20:42.530 --> 00:20:46.460 align:middle line:84%
is really emphasized as
being a random mutation.

00:20:46.460 --> 00:20:48.090 align:middle line:90%
That's an accidental mutation.

00:20:48.090 --> 00:20:50.090 align:middle line:84%
So I said, well, what's
the function of a human?

00:20:50.090 --> 00:20:51.770 align:middle line:84%
They said, well, we
got here through,

00:20:51.770 --> 00:20:53.660 align:middle line:84%
what, a whole
series of accidents,

00:20:53.660 --> 00:20:54.710 align:middle line:90%
accidental mutations.

00:20:54.710 --> 00:20:56.450 align:middle line:84%
So I say, then
what is the purpose

00:20:56.450 --> 00:20:57.533 align:middle line:90%
of us being on the planet?

00:20:57.533 --> 00:20:59.450 align:middle line:84%
And if you look at it
from that point of view,

00:20:59.450 --> 00:21:00.860 align:middle line:84%
it says, we have
no purpose, it's

00:21:00.860 --> 00:21:03.270 align:middle line:84%
only an accident that we're
here in the first place.

00:21:03.270 --> 00:21:04.645 align:middle line:84%
But if you go back
and understand

00:21:04.645 --> 00:21:07.670 align:middle line:84%
that every organism is adjusting
itself to the environment

00:21:07.670 --> 00:21:10.250 align:middle line:84%
and trying to keep balance
with all the other organisms,

00:21:10.250 --> 00:21:12.860 align:middle line:84%
every time nature
add in an organism,

00:21:12.860 --> 00:21:15.830 align:middle line:84%
she added it because the
previous system was getting out

00:21:15.830 --> 00:21:16.637 align:middle line:90%
of balance.

00:21:16.637 --> 00:21:19.220 align:middle line:84%
And you bring a new one in, and
it returns it back to balance.

00:21:19.220 --> 00:21:21.920 align:middle line:84%
But inevitably, that will throw
it out of balance as well.

00:21:21.920 --> 00:21:23.870 align:middle line:90%
Then another new one comes in.

00:21:23.870 --> 00:21:26.880 align:middle line:84%
And we are near the
top of this addition.

00:21:26.880 --> 00:21:30.620 align:middle line:84%
We are so powerful an
influence in the environment

00:21:30.620 --> 00:21:33.980 align:middle line:84%
that without knowledge that was
our job, look what we've done.

00:21:33.980 --> 00:21:35.720 align:middle line:84%
We're destroying
the environment.

00:21:35.720 --> 00:21:37.820 align:middle line:90%
So the wake up call is this.

00:21:37.820 --> 00:21:41.370 align:middle line:84%
We cannot live without nature
because we came from nature.

00:21:41.370 --> 00:21:42.950 align:middle line:84%
If we destroy nature
as we're doing,

00:21:42.950 --> 00:21:45.350 align:middle line:84%
then we're actually
cutting our own lifeline

00:21:45.350 --> 00:21:47.210 align:middle line:90%
to the planet at this point.

00:21:47.210 --> 00:21:49.230 align:middle line:84%
So the issue is,
what can we learn?

00:21:49.230 --> 00:21:52.760 align:middle line:84%
The answer is, we must learn to
return the environment as best

00:21:52.760 --> 00:21:55.820 align:middle line:84%
we can, or at least learn
how to live in harmony

00:21:55.820 --> 00:21:57.200 align:middle line:90%
with this environment.

00:21:57.200 --> 00:22:00.320 align:middle line:84%
And I understand very
importantly, as you talk about,

00:22:00.320 --> 00:22:02.540 align:middle line:84%
the idea that climate
change is occurring.

00:22:02.540 --> 00:22:06.260 align:middle line:84%
Yes, that's a natural
process in itself.

00:22:06.260 --> 00:22:10.010 align:middle line:84%
Of course, we're exacerbating
it because our own activities

00:22:10.010 --> 00:22:12.087 align:middle line:90%
are making it worse.

00:22:12.087 --> 00:22:14.420 align:middle line:84%
But the most important thing
that you say, and it really

00:22:14.420 --> 00:22:16.143 align:middle line:90%
should come out again, is this.

00:22:16.143 --> 00:22:18.560 align:middle line:84%
The idea that we'll sit around
one day and the environment

00:22:18.560 --> 00:22:20.268 align:middle line:84%
will return, and
everybody will be happy,

00:22:20.268 --> 00:22:24.470 align:middle line:84%
get back in the garden again,
this is not really a likely

00:22:24.470 --> 00:22:27.080 align:middle line:84%
possibility, the
idea that we should

00:22:27.080 --> 00:22:30.297 align:middle line:84%
learn to move with the change
and not sit in this space

00:22:30.297 --> 00:22:32.630 align:middle line:84%
and hope that the climate
decides to come back and visit

00:22:32.630 --> 00:22:33.710 align:middle line:90%
us over here.

00:22:33.710 --> 00:22:36.530 align:middle line:84%
We must prepare for a
future that's different,

00:22:36.530 --> 00:22:39.560 align:middle line:84%
and therefore, sitting around
and waiting for change,

00:22:39.560 --> 00:22:42.500 align:middle line:84%
or thinking if, well, we just
stop burning some fossil fuel,

00:22:42.500 --> 00:22:44.420 align:middle line:84%
life will return--
it's like, no.

00:22:44.420 --> 00:22:47.810 align:middle line:84%
We start now to plan
how we will live

00:22:47.810 --> 00:22:50.960 align:middle line:84%
in an environment that
is complex and changing

00:22:50.960 --> 00:22:52.220 align:middle line:90%
all the time.

00:22:52.220 --> 00:22:54.470 align:middle line:84%
That means we now have
to really use our heads

00:22:54.470 --> 00:22:57.780 align:middle line:84%
to say, how can we
compensate for this?

00:22:57.780 --> 00:22:59.480 align:middle line:84%
And if we don't go
in that direction--

00:22:59.480 --> 00:23:02.360 align:middle line:84%
and we just sit here in the
chair and say, hey, Gregg,

00:23:02.360 --> 00:23:05.070 align:middle line:84%
look out the window and tell me,
has it returned back to normal

00:23:05.070 --> 00:23:05.870 align:middle line:90%
yet--

00:23:05.870 --> 00:23:07.910 align:middle line:84%
we're doomed in that
particular case.

00:23:07.910 --> 00:23:09.230 align:middle line:84%
>>BRADEN: That's the
thing with so many people.

00:23:09.230 --> 00:23:10.700 align:middle line:84%
This is such a different
way of thinking,

00:23:10.700 --> 00:23:12.747 align:middle line:84%
and I've emphasized that
throughout this series.

00:23:12.747 --> 00:23:14.330 align:middle line:84%
It's a very different
way of thinking,

00:23:14.330 --> 00:23:17.120 align:middle line:84%
and it can be frightening
for people who

00:23:17.120 --> 00:23:18.860 align:middle line:90%
don't know all the parameters.

00:23:18.860 --> 00:23:21.890 align:middle line:84%
Many people are waiting for the
world to get back to normal,

00:23:21.890 --> 00:23:25.470 align:middle line:84%
and we cannot go back to a
world that no longer exists.

00:23:25.470 --> 00:23:27.980 align:middle line:84%
So if we're clinging
to those old ideas,

00:23:27.980 --> 00:23:30.390 align:middle line:84%
it's difficult to embrace
the new discoveries that

00:23:30.390 --> 00:23:31.380 align:middle line:90%
are coming.

00:23:31.380 --> 00:23:33.620 align:middle line:84%
And I think the value of what
you're doing through your work,

00:23:33.620 --> 00:23:35.078 align:middle line:84%
hopefully what I'm
doing with mine,

00:23:35.078 --> 00:23:37.640 align:middle line:84%
and what we do as we
share this together,

00:23:37.640 --> 00:23:42.080 align:middle line:84%
is that we're sharing rock solid
science, new discoveries that

00:23:42.080 --> 00:23:45.470 align:middle line:84%
give us reasons to think
differently at a time

00:23:45.470 --> 00:23:48.890 align:middle line:84%
when the changing world requires
us to think differently.

00:23:48.890 --> 00:23:51.660 align:middle line:84%
So we have the
information we need,

00:23:51.660 --> 00:23:54.260 align:middle line:84%
and your studies of
the cells are showing

00:23:54.260 --> 00:23:59.240 align:middle line:84%
that when we can allow ourselves
to adapt to that environment

00:23:59.240 --> 00:24:02.160 align:middle line:84%
rather than
resisting the change,

00:24:02.160 --> 00:24:04.400 align:middle line:84%
we are the cells in this
new emerging humanity.

00:24:04.400 --> 00:24:05.200 align:middle line:90%
>>LIPTON: Right.

00:24:05.200 --> 00:24:06.783 align:middle line:84%
Well that, to me,
is really important,

00:24:06.783 --> 00:24:09.320 align:middle line:84%
because we have a
theory of evolution

00:24:09.320 --> 00:24:12.140 align:middle line:84%
from a Darwinian perspective,
which unfortunately is not

00:24:12.140 --> 00:24:12.980 align:middle line:90%
accurate enough.

00:24:12.980 --> 00:24:14.438 align:middle line:84%
And it has caused
a lot of problems

00:24:14.438 --> 00:24:17.480 align:middle line:84%
because the premise of it
is that life is a struggle

00:24:17.480 --> 00:24:19.250 align:middle line:90%
and that there's competition.

00:24:19.250 --> 00:24:22.200 align:middle line:84%
And there's going to be winners,
and there's going to be losers.

00:24:22.200 --> 00:24:24.060 align:middle line:84%
And I said, well,
what kind of result

00:24:24.060 --> 00:24:25.310 align:middle line:90%
comes from a theory like that?

00:24:25.310 --> 00:24:27.352 align:middle line:84%
I said, well first,
competition leads to violate,

00:24:27.352 --> 00:24:28.765 align:middle line:90%
and violence leads to war.

00:24:28.765 --> 00:24:30.890 align:middle line:84%
And all of this fighting
over this, in the process,

00:24:30.890 --> 00:24:33.290 align:middle line:84%
we destroy the environment
that's giving us life.

00:24:33.290 --> 00:24:36.140 align:middle line:84%
And the reality is this
theory is not correct,

00:24:36.140 --> 00:24:39.110 align:middle line:84%
that there is actually
two phases of evolution.

00:24:39.110 --> 00:24:41.630 align:middle line:84%
First, make the smarter
individual, the smartest one.

00:24:41.630 --> 00:24:43.700 align:middle line:84%
That's somewhat of
a Darwinian theory.

00:24:43.700 --> 00:24:45.740 align:middle line:84%
But once you get the
smartest individual,

00:24:45.740 --> 00:24:47.780 align:middle line:84%
you can't make an
individual any smarter,

00:24:47.780 --> 00:24:49.440 align:middle line:90%
there's physical parameters.

00:24:49.440 --> 00:24:52.310 align:middle line:84%
But it turns out nature
has repeated a cycle.

00:24:52.310 --> 00:24:55.520 align:middle line:84%
Once it always made the
smartest individual and species,

00:24:55.520 --> 00:24:59.900 align:middle line:84%
the next level of evolution is
to bring individuals together

00:24:59.900 --> 00:25:02.610 align:middle line:84%
to share their awareness
in a community.

00:25:02.610 --> 00:25:06.050 align:middle line:84%
So the phase of evolution that
we're experiencing right now

00:25:06.050 --> 00:25:08.300 align:middle line:84%
is, OK, we got all
the smart humans,

00:25:08.300 --> 00:25:11.720 align:middle line:84%
but now we have to bring the
humans together collectively

00:25:11.720 --> 00:25:15.170 align:middle line:84%
into a new organism, a super
organism called humanity.

00:25:15.170 --> 00:25:17.270 align:middle line:84%
Well, we have 50
trillion cells making up

00:25:17.270 --> 00:25:19.280 align:middle line:90%
a body we call a human.

00:25:19.280 --> 00:25:22.310 align:middle line:84%
Humanity, as an
organism, will have

00:25:22.310 --> 00:25:25.490 align:middle line:84%
approximately 8 billion
human cells as part

00:25:25.490 --> 00:25:27.500 align:middle line:90%
of this one living structure.

00:25:27.500 --> 00:25:30.510 align:middle line:84%
When our cells in our body
don't live in harmony,

00:25:30.510 --> 00:25:32.240 align:middle line:84%
that's called
autoimmune disease.

00:25:32.240 --> 00:25:34.742 align:middle line:84%
It's self-destruction
by definition.

00:25:34.742 --> 00:25:36.200 align:middle line:84%
If you look at the
world right now,

00:25:36.200 --> 00:25:38.630 align:middle line:84%
you start to realize
the human cells are not

00:25:38.630 --> 00:25:40.240 align:middle line:84%
living in harmony
with each other,

00:25:40.240 --> 00:25:42.860 align:middle line:84%
that the planet is experiencing
autoimmune disease,

00:25:42.860 --> 00:25:44.180 align:middle line:90%
self-destruction.

00:25:44.180 --> 00:25:45.830 align:middle line:90%
So the evolution is what?

00:25:45.830 --> 00:25:48.980 align:middle line:84%
Breaking down the
barriers that separate us,

00:25:48.980 --> 00:25:50.630 align:middle line:84%
because ultimately,
it's only when

00:25:50.630 --> 00:25:53.330 align:middle line:84%
we come together and recognize
the unity, that all humans are

00:25:53.330 --> 00:25:56.420 align:middle line:84%
cells in the same body, that
there will be a time where

00:25:56.420 --> 00:25:57.860 align:middle line:84%
we stop competing
with each other

00:25:57.860 --> 00:25:59.840 align:middle line:84%
and start cooperating
with each other.

00:25:59.840 --> 00:26:02.138 align:middle line:84%
And cooperation is
the new science.

00:26:02.138 --> 00:26:03.180 align:middle line:90%
>>BRADEN: That's the key.

00:26:03.180 --> 00:26:05.150 align:middle line:84%
This is why what we
shared at the UN,

00:26:05.150 --> 00:26:07.750 align:middle line:84%
I think of all the
things that we shared--

00:26:07.750 --> 00:26:09.260 align:middle line:84%
and just to bring
this to a close--

00:26:09.260 --> 00:26:13.790 align:middle line:84%
is the idea that nature is based
upon a model of cooperation,

00:26:13.790 --> 00:26:17.150 align:middle line:84%
not competition, of all
places, at the United Nations,

00:26:17.150 --> 00:26:21.305 align:middle line:84%
where they are helping people of
very different beliefs and very

00:26:21.305 --> 00:26:23.430 align:middle line:84%
different cultures work
together to solve problems.

00:26:23.430 --> 00:26:28.100 align:middle line:84%
To begin doing it from the
perspective of this model based

00:26:28.100 --> 00:26:30.590 align:middle line:84%
upon the harmony
in nature, I think,

00:26:30.590 --> 00:26:32.270 align:middle line:90%
is a powerful step forward.

00:26:32.270 --> 00:26:33.770 align:middle line:84%
And I want to thank
you for the work

00:26:33.770 --> 00:26:36.600 align:middle line:84%
that you're doing to
bring that forward.

00:26:36.600 --> 00:26:38.360 align:middle line:84%
>>LIPTON: Well, I
think collectively,

00:26:38.360 --> 00:26:41.120 align:middle line:84%
I enjoy what we do because we
offer the world an opportunity

00:26:41.120 --> 00:26:44.277 align:middle line:84%
to let go of the old beliefs
of limitation and separation

00:26:44.277 --> 00:26:45.860 align:middle line:84%
and allow them to
come together and be

00:26:45.860 --> 00:26:48.920 align:middle line:84%
more empowered to control
their own biology as well

00:26:48.920 --> 00:26:51.320 align:middle line:84%
as the nature of the
community of life

00:26:51.320 --> 00:26:53.000 align:middle line:90%
that we're in right now.

00:26:53.000 --> 00:26:56.270 align:middle line:10%
Just in closing, what
I have in my book

00:26:56.270 --> 00:26:58.970 align:middle line:10%
"Spontaneous Evolution" is
a humorous little thing.

00:26:58.970 --> 00:27:02.210 align:middle line:10%
It's that a garden is
not a battleground.

00:27:02.210 --> 00:27:03.908 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:27:03.908 --> 00:27:06.200 align:middle line:84%
And the simple reality is,
what happened to our garden?

00:27:06.200 --> 00:27:08.540 align:middle line:84%
I say the battle is
destroying the garden,

00:27:08.540 --> 00:27:10.918 align:middle line:84%
and peace is what is required
to bring it back again.

00:27:10.918 --> 00:27:12.710 align:middle line:84%
>>BRADEN: Bruce Lipton,
I want to thank you

00:27:12.710 --> 00:27:14.127 align:middle line:84%
for the work you
do, and thank you

00:27:14.127 --> 00:27:17.120 align:middle line:84%
for taking a few minutes
to talk with us tonight,

00:27:17.120 --> 00:27:17.920 align:middle line:90%
share this wisdom.

00:27:17.920 --> 00:27:20.253 align:middle line:84%
We're going to have another
conversation on a little bit

00:27:20.253 --> 00:27:22.880 align:middle line:84%
different topic in this series,
and I look forward to that

00:27:22.880 --> 00:27:23.400 align:middle line:90%
as well.

00:27:23.400 --> 00:27:23.930 align:middle line:90%
>>LIPTON: I do too.

00:27:23.930 --> 00:27:26.420 align:middle line:84%
Thank you so very much for this
opportunity, brother Gregg.

00:27:26.420 --> 00:27:27.800 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:27:27.800 --> 00:27:29.450 align:middle line:84%
>>BRADEN: I'm your
host, Gregg Braden,

00:27:29.450 --> 00:27:31.220 align:middle line:84%
and I'm inviting
you to stay tuned

00:27:31.220 --> 00:27:34.010 align:middle line:84%
for another episode of
"Missing Links," a very

00:27:34.010 --> 00:27:36.020 align:middle line:84%
special episode where
Bruce and I are going

00:27:36.020 --> 00:27:38.420 align:middle line:84%
to talk about the new
discoveries that are continuing

00:27:38.420 --> 00:27:39.380 align:middle line:90%
to support our work.

00:27:39.380 --> 00:27:42.730 align:middle line:90%
