00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:27.860 align:middle line:84%
>> Welcome to a special
series of "Missing Links,"

00:00:27.860 --> 00:00:29.930 align:middle line:84%
where your questions
get answered.

00:00:29.930 --> 00:00:32.150 align:middle line:10%
I'm your host, Tiffany
Bush, and I'm also

00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:34.610 align:middle line:10%
the head of the member
support team here at Gaia.

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:37.665 align:middle line:84%
And with me today is the star
of the show, Gregg Braden.

00:00:37.665 --> 00:00:40.040 align:middle line:10%
We're here to answer your
questions from the first season

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:41.120 align:middle line:10%
of "Missing Links."

00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:42.310 align:middle line:90%
Welcome, Gregg.

00:00:42.310 --> 00:00:45.050 align:middle line:84%
>> Tiffany, I am so excited
to be here today and really

00:00:45.050 --> 00:00:46.467 align:middle line:84%
thrilled to talk
about this topic.

00:00:46.467 --> 00:00:48.258 align:middle line:84%
Thank you for having
me, and I look forward

00:00:48.258 --> 00:00:49.110 align:middle line:90%
to these questions.

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:49.910 align:middle line:90%
>> Thank you.

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:51.350 align:middle line:90%
We're excited to have you too.

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:54.560 align:middle line:84%
I get so many great questions
from our members, and just

00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:56.840 align:middle line:84%
the fact that you're here
is just an honor for me

00:00:56.840 --> 00:01:00.710 align:middle line:84%
to talk to you, but also for our
members that really are looking

00:01:00.710 --> 00:01:02.090 align:middle line:90%
for answers, so thank you.

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:04.610 align:middle line:84%
>> Can I share a little
secret with our members?

00:01:04.610 --> 00:01:07.272 align:middle line:84%
Where we're seeing right now is
the very room, the very studio,

00:01:07.272 --> 00:01:09.230 align:middle line:84%
and the very place where
all of "Missing Links"

00:01:09.230 --> 00:01:10.490 align:middle line:90%
was filmed originally.

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:13.430 align:middle line:84%
So this is like
deja vu coming back,

00:01:13.430 --> 00:01:14.907 align:middle line:84%
and it's the rest
of the program.

00:01:14.907 --> 00:01:16.740 align:middle line:84%
So it feels really good
to be here with you.

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:16.880 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:17.330 align:middle line:90%
>> Love it.

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:17.720 align:middle line:90%
Love it.

00:01:17.720 --> 00:01:19.560 align:middle line:84%
So it's just like they're
here with us today.

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:20.190 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:01:20.190 --> 00:01:22.565 align:middle line:84%
>> Let's go ahead and get
started with Leanne's question.

00:01:22.565 --> 00:01:24.560 align:middle line:10%
She wants to know,
"Can you clarify

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:27.440 align:middle line:10%
the connection between
our hearts' intelligence

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:30.470 align:middle line:10%
and our subconsciousness?

00:01:30.470 --> 00:01:33.200 align:middle line:10%
Are they the same
intelligence, or is the heart

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:37.100 align:middle line:10%
our higher consciousness,
which acts as a gateway

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:38.727 align:middle line:10%
to our subconsciousness?"

00:01:38.727 --> 00:01:39.920 align:middle line:90%
[CHUCKLING]

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:41.660 align:middle line:84%
I think it's important
to understand

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:44.540 align:middle line:84%
if our blocking
subconscious beliefs can

00:01:44.540 --> 00:01:48.482 align:middle line:84%
affect our hearts' intelligence
and the messages it gives us.

00:01:48.482 --> 00:01:49.940 align:middle line:84%
>> That's a really
good-- actually,

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:51.840 align:middle line:84%
three or four questions
that are in there.

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:52.640 align:middle line:90%
So I'm going to--

00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:54.598 align:middle line:84%
I want to address this
quickly at a high level,

00:01:54.598 --> 00:01:56.300 align:middle line:84%
but I want it to be
complete, and I want

00:01:56.300 --> 00:01:58.220 align:middle line:90%
to be complete in saying this.

00:01:58.220 --> 00:02:01.280 align:middle line:90%


00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:04.490 align:middle line:84%
1991-- as I talked about in
"Missing Links," the discovery

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:07.150 align:middle line:84%
of 40,000 specialized
cells in the human heart

00:02:07.150 --> 00:02:10.169 align:middle line:84%
changed the way we think
about the heart forever.

00:02:10.169 --> 00:02:12.620 align:middle line:90%
These are sensory neurites.

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:14.162 align:middle line:84%
They're essentially
brain-like cells,

00:02:14.162 --> 00:02:15.370 align:middle line:90%
but they're not in the brain.

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:16.310 align:middle line:90%
They're in the heart.

00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:22.520 align:middle line:84%
They think, remember, and learn
independently of the brain

00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:23.960 align:middle line:90%
in our head.

00:02:23.960 --> 00:02:28.280 align:middle line:84%
And one of the ways that
that independence occurs

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:34.450 align:middle line:84%
is our heart doesn't work
through the filters of the ego,

00:02:34.450 --> 00:02:38.640 align:middle line:84%
the self-doubt, the criticism
that we hear from the time

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:40.640 align:middle line:84%
that we're young, sometimes
from the people that

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:42.150 align:middle line:90%
are closest to us.

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:45.710 align:middle line:84%
So when we communicate
directly with our hearts,

00:02:45.710 --> 00:02:47.690 align:middle line:84%
the information
usually comes quickly.

00:02:47.690 --> 00:02:48.590 align:middle line:90%
It's very concise.

00:02:48.590 --> 00:02:49.610 align:middle line:90%
It's very direct.

00:02:49.610 --> 00:02:52.400 align:middle line:84%
There's no preamble or
introduction to the answer,

00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:54.770 align:middle line:84%
And it doesn't need to
have that because it's not

00:02:54.770 --> 00:02:55.940 align:middle line:90%
going through those filters.

00:02:55.940 --> 00:02:57.960 align:middle line:90%
Our brain, on the other hand--

00:02:57.960 --> 00:03:00.340 align:middle line:84%
when we ask ourselves
a question, our brain--

00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:04.220 align:middle line:84%
we can go through the loop, the
endless loop of all the doubt,

00:03:04.220 --> 00:03:05.810 align:middle line:84%
and the criticisms,
and the questions,

00:03:05.810 --> 00:03:08.180 align:middle line:84%
and the circular logic,
and the reasoning.

00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:11.060 align:middle line:84%
That is a distinction between
the heart and the brain.

00:03:11.060 --> 00:03:13.400 align:middle line:84%
However, the brain
can think in logic.

00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:16.950 align:middle line:84%
The heart doesn't think
in logic in the same way.

00:03:16.950 --> 00:03:19.680 align:middle line:84%
So this is how they
function independently.

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:21.980 align:middle line:84%
What we are talking
about in "Missing Links"

00:03:21.980 --> 00:03:26.600 align:middle line:84%
is these two separate
organs may be harmonized

00:03:26.600 --> 00:03:29.930 align:middle line:84%
into a single,
potent neural network

00:03:29.930 --> 00:03:32.680 align:middle line:84%
so that we can tap
the benefit of both.

00:03:32.680 --> 00:03:35.120 align:middle line:84%
And when we do that,
we harmonize the heart

00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:36.645 align:middle line:84%
and the brain
through the process

00:03:36.645 --> 00:03:38.930 align:middle line:84%
that I shared in
"Missing Links" where

00:03:38.930 --> 00:03:41.270 align:middle line:84%
we create a 0.1 hertz
signal between the heart

00:03:41.270 --> 00:03:42.070 align:middle line:90%
and the brain.

00:03:42.070 --> 00:03:44.690 align:middle line:84%
We feel the feelings
to create that signal.

00:03:44.690 --> 00:03:47.720 align:middle line:84%
That is the hot line
to the subconscious.

00:03:47.720 --> 00:03:50.210 align:middle line:84%
It is the harmonization
of the heart and the brain

00:03:50.210 --> 00:03:54.200 align:middle line:84%
that gives us direct access
into the subconscious.

00:03:54.200 --> 00:03:57.930 align:middle line:84%
So when we are working
with our heart,

00:03:57.930 --> 00:04:00.500 align:middle line:90%
we're working with heart wisdom.

00:04:00.500 --> 00:04:01.970 align:middle line:84%
And the beauty of
that heart wisdom

00:04:01.970 --> 00:04:04.299 align:middle line:84%
is that we can ask anything
that we choose to ask.

00:04:04.299 --> 00:04:05.840 align:middle line:84%
And what I'm hearing
in this question

00:04:05.840 --> 00:04:08.090 align:middle line:84%
is, how do we know
what we're hearing?

00:04:08.090 --> 00:04:10.490 align:middle line:84%
And this is-- people ask me
this all the time, Tiffany.

00:04:10.490 --> 00:04:13.322 align:middle line:84%
They'll come up to me and
they'll say, I had this dream,

00:04:13.322 --> 00:04:15.530 align:middle line:84%
and it is so vivid, and the
very detail-- and they'll

00:04:15.530 --> 00:04:17.100 align:middle line:84%
give me all the details
about this dream.

00:04:17.100 --> 00:04:19.329 align:middle line:84%
But then they look at me and
they say, what does that mean?

00:04:19.329 --> 00:04:21.110 align:middle line:84%
And I have to say
them, I have no idea

00:04:21.110 --> 00:04:22.760 align:middle line:90%
because it's your dream.

00:04:22.760 --> 00:04:24.620 align:middle line:84%
If you're empowered
to have the dream

00:04:24.620 --> 00:04:29.300 align:middle line:84%
or you receive a message
from the universe

00:04:29.300 --> 00:04:30.920 align:middle line:84%
and you're not sure
what that means,

00:04:30.920 --> 00:04:33.260 align:middle line:84%
you're empowered
to use the system

00:04:33.260 --> 00:04:37.999 align:middle line:84%
to go back and query
this intelligence.

00:04:37.999 --> 00:04:39.290 align:middle line:90%
What does this mean in my life?

00:04:39.290 --> 00:04:40.700 align:middle line:84%
What am I being
shown in this dream?

00:04:40.700 --> 00:04:42.283 align:middle line:84%
Where's this
intelligence coming from?

00:04:42.283 --> 00:04:43.450 align:middle line:90%
Where does this message--

00:04:43.450 --> 00:04:45.890 align:middle line:84%
where's this
message originating?

00:04:45.890 --> 00:04:47.720 align:middle line:84%
Rather than trying
to guess-- and

00:04:47.720 --> 00:04:50.030 align:middle line:84%
this heart-brain
communication empowers

00:04:50.030 --> 00:04:52.070 align:middle line:90%
us to be able to do that.

00:04:52.070 --> 00:04:54.560 align:middle line:90%
So we're talking heart-brain--

00:04:54.560 --> 00:04:57.710 align:middle line:84%
the connection to
the subconscious

00:04:57.710 --> 00:05:01.400 align:middle line:84%
without going through the
hypnosis or relaxation

00:05:01.400 --> 00:05:02.720 align:middle line:90%
or anything like that.

00:05:02.720 --> 00:05:06.350 align:middle line:84%
>> I think it's interesting
that you even mention the idea

00:05:06.350 --> 00:05:10.290 align:middle line:84%
of talking to the heart and
having a conversation with it.

00:05:10.290 --> 00:05:14.600 align:middle line:84%
Let's move on to Lisa's
question about manifestation.

00:05:14.600 --> 00:05:16.100 align:middle line:84%
So I'm going to
read the whole thing

00:05:16.100 --> 00:05:18.790 align:middle line:84%
because it's really interesting,
the way she words it.

00:05:18.790 --> 00:05:21.680 align:middle line:84%
"You related the story of a
shaman manifesting an outcome--

00:05:21.680 --> 00:05:22.880 align:middle line:90%
in this case, rain--

00:05:22.880 --> 00:05:24.920 align:middle line:84%
through the mind
framework of it already

00:05:24.920 --> 00:05:27.080 align:middle line:84%
having occurred and
internalizing it

00:05:27.080 --> 00:05:31.430 align:middle line:84%
correspondingly with the
feeling of wet feet, et cetera.

00:05:31.430 --> 00:05:34.940 align:middle line:84%
How does this paradigm compare
with that of intention?

00:05:34.940 --> 00:05:36.680 align:middle line:84%
For example, if I
set my intention

00:05:36.680 --> 00:05:39.590 align:middle line:84%
towards manifesting a
particular reality or goal,

00:05:39.590 --> 00:05:41.480 align:middle line:84%
is that self-defeating
in the sense

00:05:41.480 --> 00:05:44.960 align:middle line:84%
that I am desiring an outcome
rather than treating it

00:05:44.960 --> 00:05:46.460 align:middle line:90%
as already realized?

00:05:46.460 --> 00:05:48.540 align:middle line:84%
Does intention still play
a role in manifesting?"

00:05:48.540 --> 00:05:50.810 align:middle line:84%
>> That's a great
question, and once again,

00:05:50.810 --> 00:05:52.820 align:middle line:84%
and not surprisingly, there are
multiple questions within that

00:05:52.820 --> 00:05:53.620 align:middle line:90%
question.

00:05:53.620 --> 00:05:55.580 align:middle line:90%
I'll be as concise as I can.

00:05:55.580 --> 00:05:57.479 align:middle line:84%
Part of this-- we're
dealing with language.

00:05:57.479 --> 00:05:59.270 align:middle line:84%
The word "intention"
means different things

00:05:59.270 --> 00:06:00.590 align:middle line:90%
to different people.

00:06:00.590 --> 00:06:03.980 align:middle line:84%
A lot of the answers
is in how intention

00:06:03.980 --> 00:06:07.490 align:middle line:84%
is defined by the person
asking the question,

00:06:07.490 --> 00:06:08.600 align:middle line:90%
and there's a difference.

00:06:08.600 --> 00:06:09.950 align:middle line:90%
There's a distinction.

00:06:09.950 --> 00:06:13.110 align:middle line:84%
When we intend something,
more often than not,

00:06:13.110 --> 00:06:15.320 align:middle line:90%
there is no outcome.

00:06:15.320 --> 00:06:16.610 align:middle line:90%
It's open-ended.

00:06:16.610 --> 00:06:19.850 align:middle line:84%
So we can intend that
we're going to be abundant.

00:06:19.850 --> 00:06:22.460 align:middle line:84%
We can intend that our
perfect mate is manifesting

00:06:22.460 --> 00:06:24.080 align:middle line:90%
for us in our lives.

00:06:24.080 --> 00:06:25.460 align:middle line:90%
And to the universe--

00:06:25.460 --> 00:06:27.290 align:middle line:90%
the universe is very literal.

00:06:27.290 --> 00:06:30.060 align:middle line:84%
Nature interprets
that very literally.

00:06:30.060 --> 00:06:31.510 align:middle line:84%
And if you say,
I intend for this

00:06:31.510 --> 00:06:34.300 align:middle line:84%
to happen, the universe will
say, OK, you can intend,

00:06:34.300 --> 00:06:37.180 align:middle line:84%
and intend, and
intend, and intend.

00:06:37.180 --> 00:06:38.660 align:middle line:90%
But there's no outcome.

00:06:38.660 --> 00:06:42.410 align:middle line:84%
There's no way for that
intent to become manifest

00:06:42.410 --> 00:06:43.210 align:middle line:90%
on the one hand.

00:06:43.210 --> 00:06:50.530 align:middle line:84%
And on the other hand,
when we come from the sense

00:06:50.530 --> 00:06:54.280 align:middle line:84%
that whatever it is that we're
hoping to have in our world

00:06:54.280 --> 00:06:57.260 align:middle line:84%
is already in place, when
we begin with the outcome--

00:06:57.260 --> 00:07:00.250 align:middle line:84%
this is so powerful,
and it's so subtle.

00:07:00.250 --> 00:07:02.830 align:middle line:84%
This is a form of
prayer that was

00:07:02.830 --> 00:07:05.320 align:middle line:84%
lost in the fourth century
when it was edited out

00:07:05.320 --> 00:07:08.200 align:middle line:84%
of the modern Christian
text by the Church

00:07:08.200 --> 00:07:10.160 align:middle line:90%
in the fourth century.

00:07:10.160 --> 00:07:13.800 align:middle line:10%
And we see this form of
prayer in the edited books,

00:07:13.800 --> 00:07:16.360 align:middle line:10%
such as the Gospel
of Thomas, where

00:07:16.360 --> 00:07:18.760 align:middle line:10%
we're told to begin
with the outcome

00:07:18.760 --> 00:07:20.170 align:middle line:10%
as if it's already happened.

00:07:20.170 --> 00:07:21.760 align:middle line:90%
Begin with the healing.

00:07:21.760 --> 00:07:23.080 align:middle line:90%
Claim the healing.

00:07:23.080 --> 00:07:24.770 align:middle line:84%
Give thanks for
what's already there.

00:07:24.770 --> 00:07:27.430 align:middle line:84%
And people say, well,
am I fooling myself

00:07:27.430 --> 00:07:29.430 align:middle line:84%
if I do that, if I'm
giving thanks for something

00:07:29.430 --> 00:07:30.229 align:middle line:90%
I don't see?

00:07:30.229 --> 00:07:32.260 align:middle line:84%
And the answer is no, and
here's the reason why.

00:07:32.260 --> 00:07:38.080 align:middle line:84%
We are quantum beings as well
as linear, mechanistic beings.

00:07:38.080 --> 00:07:39.610 align:middle line:90%
We live in both worlds.

00:07:39.610 --> 00:07:42.910 align:middle line:84%
On the quantum level, all
possibilities already exist.

00:07:42.910 --> 00:07:45.045 align:middle line:90%
A perfect mate already exists.

00:07:45.045 --> 00:07:46.420 align:middle line:84%
Perfect abundance
already exists.

00:07:46.420 --> 00:07:48.760 align:middle line:90%
Perfect healing already exists.

00:07:48.760 --> 00:07:50.135 align:middle line:84%
What we do-- and
this is-- again,

00:07:50.135 --> 00:07:51.718 align:middle line:84%
I'm probably not
even doing it justice

00:07:51.718 --> 00:07:53.080 align:middle line:90%
in this brief period of time.

00:07:53.080 --> 00:07:55.559 align:middle line:84%
When we through our
heart-brain harmony--

00:07:55.559 --> 00:07:57.850 align:middle line:84%
so think about this, the
electrical and magnetic fields

00:07:57.850 --> 00:07:59.380 align:middle line:90%
of the heart and the brain--

00:07:59.380 --> 00:08:04.000 align:middle line:84%
the heart is 5,000 times
more powerful magnetically

00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:07.484 align:middle line:84%
than the brain, and it's at
least 100 times more powerful

00:08:07.484 --> 00:08:08.650 align:middle line:90%
electrically than the brain.

00:08:08.650 --> 00:08:11.912 align:middle line:84%
When you combine these
together, what we're doing--

00:08:11.912 --> 00:08:13.120 align:middle line:90%
you can think of it this way.

00:08:13.120 --> 00:08:15.340 align:middle line:84%
We are literally, through
heart-brain harmony--

00:08:15.340 --> 00:08:21.610 align:middle line:84%
we are reaching into the quantum
soup of all possibilities.

00:08:21.610 --> 00:08:25.480 align:middle line:84%
And the possibility that is
nebulous and moving around-- we

00:08:25.480 --> 00:08:26.380 align:middle line:90%
are collapsing it.

00:08:26.380 --> 00:08:27.220 align:middle line:90%
We're claiming it.

00:08:27.220 --> 00:08:31.400 align:middle line:84%
We're pulling it out of
that soup to make it real.

00:08:31.400 --> 00:08:35.500 align:middle line:84%
So the example that I
gave of my native friend

00:08:35.500 --> 00:08:38.740 align:middle line:84%
creating rain in the high
desert of northern Mexico--

00:08:38.740 --> 00:08:41.230 align:middle line:84%
the rain existed in the
quantum possibility.

00:08:41.230 --> 00:08:43.220 align:middle line:84%
He claimed it
through his senses.

00:08:43.220 --> 00:08:46.060 align:middle line:84%
He felt the feeling as if
he were standing in the mud.

00:08:46.060 --> 00:08:48.130 align:middle line:84%
He smelled the
smells of the rain

00:08:48.130 --> 00:08:51.490 align:middle line:84%
coming off of the walls
of his pueblo village

00:08:51.490 --> 00:08:53.867 align:middle line:84%
as well as feeling the
feeling of gratitude

00:08:53.867 --> 00:08:55.450 align:middle line:84%
for the rain that's
already happening.

00:08:55.450 --> 00:08:57.760 align:middle line:84%
And in that way,
these are the words

00:08:57.760 --> 00:09:01.180 align:middle line:84%
that we use for the inner
technology, the quantum

00:09:01.180 --> 00:09:07.270 align:middle line:84%
technology, to collapse
the waves of possibilities

00:09:07.270 --> 00:09:11.930 align:middle line:84%
into the particle world of
something actually happening.

00:09:11.930 --> 00:09:13.987 align:middle line:90%
So the answer is yes.

00:09:13.987 --> 00:09:15.610 align:middle line:90%
[CHUCKLING]

00:09:15.610 --> 00:09:18.857 align:middle line:84%
No, but that is the
distinction between intention.

00:09:18.857 --> 00:09:20.440 align:middle line:84%
And again, this is
part of the problem

00:09:20.440 --> 00:09:23.020 align:middle line:84%
with the way many people are
taught to do affirmations.

00:09:23.020 --> 00:09:24.250 align:middle line:90%
Affirmations are powerful.

00:09:24.250 --> 00:09:25.540 align:middle line:90%
They're good.

00:09:25.540 --> 00:09:33.260 align:middle line:84%
And an affirmation has to be
given a way to resolve itself.

00:09:33.260 --> 00:09:35.120 align:middle line:84%
So the resolution
comes in the outcome.

00:09:35.120 --> 00:09:39.370 align:middle line:84%
So if you say,
I'm ready, I'm now

00:09:39.370 --> 00:09:43.060 align:middle line:84%
ready to manifest
my perfect partner.

00:09:43.060 --> 00:09:45.740 align:middle line:84%
The universe will
say, OK, you're ready,

00:09:45.740 --> 00:09:47.740 align:middle line:84%
and you're ready now, and
you're ready tomorrow,

00:09:47.740 --> 00:09:50.530 align:middle line:84%
and you're ready-- you can be
ready for a bajillion years

00:09:50.530 --> 00:09:51.685 align:middle line:90%
because there's no outcome.

00:09:51.685 --> 00:09:52.890 align:middle line:84%
Does that make sense
if I say it that way?

00:09:52.890 --> 00:09:53.690 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes, absolutely.

00:09:53.690 --> 00:09:57.610 align:middle line:84%
>> So the difference in quantum,
rather than saying you're open

00:09:57.610 --> 00:10:01.130 align:middle line:84%
to something, you're claiming
as if it has already occurred.

00:10:01.130 --> 00:10:03.400 align:middle line:10%
So in the words of
the Master Jesus--

00:10:03.400 --> 00:10:05.390 align:middle line:10%
not from a religious
perspective,

00:10:05.390 --> 00:10:07.810 align:middle line:10%
but as a masterful teacher--

00:10:07.810 --> 00:10:13.430 align:middle line:10%
what he told his students was
be surrounded by your desire.

00:10:13.430 --> 00:10:17.320 align:middle line:84%
Be surrounded by your joy
so that it can be fulfilled.

00:10:17.320 --> 00:10:20.200 align:middle line:84%
The only way to be is for
it to have already happened,

00:10:20.200 --> 00:10:22.550 align:middle line:84%
to feel the feelings as
if it's already there.

00:10:22.550 --> 00:10:26.320 align:middle line:84%
And this is-- so we're talking
about the power of human

00:10:26.320 --> 00:10:31.780 align:middle line:84%
emotion to bring an internal
technology of quantum

00:10:31.780 --> 00:10:35.410 align:middle line:84%
manifestation into reality
in our physical world,

00:10:35.410 --> 00:10:37.540 align:middle line:84%
and we're trying to do it
in a couple of minutes--

00:10:37.540 --> 00:10:38.456 align:middle line:90%
>> That's interesting.

00:10:38.456 --> 00:10:39.666 align:middle line:90%
>> --on this Q&A.

00:10:39.666 --> 00:10:40.540 align:middle line:90%
>> It makes me think.

00:10:40.540 --> 00:10:43.930 align:middle line:10%
So the editing out of the--

00:10:43.930 --> 00:10:46.090 align:middle line:10%
almost the key--
there's these key words,

00:10:46.090 --> 00:10:49.750 align:middle line:10%
so I wonder if it's a bit of
telephone happening when it

00:10:49.750 --> 00:10:52.040 align:middle line:10%
gets reinterpreted
or if it's more--

00:10:52.040 --> 00:10:54.070 align:middle line:10%
they intentionally
know that if you

00:10:54.070 --> 00:10:58.250 align:middle line:10%
ask in knowing that it will be.

00:10:58.250 --> 00:10:59.730 align:middle line:90%
It's a hard thing to understand.

00:10:59.730 --> 00:11:02.250 align:middle line:84%
>> As a scientist, I can
only speculate on that.

00:11:02.250 --> 00:11:05.750 align:middle line:84%
I'll say that the
impact of removing this

00:11:05.750 --> 00:11:10.850 align:middle line:84%
from our most cherished and
sacred spiritual text of 2/3

00:11:10.850 --> 00:11:17.640 align:middle line:84%
of the religious world, the
2 billion-plus Christians

00:11:17.640 --> 00:11:20.370 align:middle line:84%
and Judeo-Christian
traditions, is--

00:11:20.370 --> 00:11:22.950 align:middle line:84%
the net effect is
that people were left

00:11:22.950 --> 00:11:26.270 align:middle line:84%
feeling powerless and
helpless in a world

00:11:26.270 --> 00:11:29.340 align:middle line:84%
where they actually have
the ability not to control

00:11:29.340 --> 00:11:32.820 align:middle line:84%
and not to manipulate,
but to influence and tip

00:11:32.820 --> 00:11:35.400 align:middle line:84%
the scales of balance
in their favor.

00:11:35.400 --> 00:11:37.900 align:middle line:84%
And for me, that makes all
the difference in the world.

00:11:37.900 --> 00:11:38.700 align:middle line:90%
>> Absolutely.

00:11:38.700 --> 00:11:41.680 align:middle line:84%
And Daniela C. wants to know
a little bit more about this.

00:11:41.680 --> 00:11:44.070 align:middle line:84%
So this is another
long question,

00:11:44.070 --> 00:11:46.500 align:middle line:84%
and it's really well-written,
so I will read it out.

00:11:46.500 --> 00:11:48.960 align:middle line:84%
She says, "If a
group of people have

00:11:48.960 --> 00:11:52.770 align:middle line:84%
the intention and the power to
emanate a peaceful feeling that

00:11:52.770 --> 00:11:56.190 align:middle line:84%
may condition those within
their radius in a positive way,

00:11:56.190 --> 00:11:59.190 align:middle line:84%
like decreasing episodes of
crime and violence for example,

00:11:59.190 --> 00:12:01.650 align:middle line:84%
presumably, there's
also the possibility

00:12:01.650 --> 00:12:03.960 align:middle line:84%
to do the same with
negative intentions

00:12:03.960 --> 00:12:06.780 align:middle line:84%
in order to achieve
the exact opposite.

00:12:06.780 --> 00:12:10.740 align:middle line:84%
If this is a potential
reality, it is also presumable

00:12:10.740 --> 00:12:13.380 align:middle line:84%
that powerful stakeholders
may have used these tactics

00:12:13.380 --> 00:12:16.650 align:middle line:84%
to obtain the public's
support for acts of war,

00:12:16.650 --> 00:12:19.610 align:middle line:90%
economic maneuvers, et cetera.

00:12:19.610 --> 00:12:22.830 align:middle line:84%
Without going into too
much conspiracy theory,

00:12:22.830 --> 00:12:25.130 align:middle line:84%
how can we recognize
those feelings

00:12:25.130 --> 00:12:26.427 align:middle line:90%
which are not our own?"

00:12:26.427 --> 00:12:28.760 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, that's a different
question, so let me do this.

00:12:28.760 --> 00:12:30.320 align:middle line:90%
I'm going to back off.

00:12:30.320 --> 00:12:31.820 align:middle line:84%
Rather than being
that specific, let

00:12:31.820 --> 00:12:36.200 align:middle line:84%
me say it in general because
I get this question a lot.

00:12:36.200 --> 00:12:39.050 align:middle line:84%
If we can feel the feeling
and create good things,

00:12:39.050 --> 00:12:41.510 align:middle line:84%
can other people feel the
feelings and create bad things?

00:12:41.510 --> 00:12:42.350 align:middle line:90%
That's the essence.

00:12:42.350 --> 00:12:42.860 align:middle line:90%
Would you agree?

00:12:42.860 --> 00:12:43.910 align:middle line:84%
Is that the essence
of the question?

00:12:43.910 --> 00:12:44.870 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, I agree.

00:12:44.870 --> 00:12:48.590 align:middle line:84%
>> Nature has built
in a fail safe,

00:12:48.590 --> 00:12:51.230 align:middle line:84%
which is so awesome when
you think about this.

00:12:51.230 --> 00:12:53.330 align:middle line:90%
And here's the way it works.

00:12:53.330 --> 00:12:57.350 align:middle line:84%
Whatever it is that we claim,
whatever it is that we create,

00:12:57.350 --> 00:13:02.480 align:middle line:84%
we will experience in our
own bodies, in our own cells,

00:13:02.480 --> 00:13:04.490 align:middle line:84%
in our own existence
before it ever

00:13:04.490 --> 00:13:07.530 align:middle line:84%
becomes manifest in
the world around us.

00:13:07.530 --> 00:13:12.920 align:middle line:84%
So if we are beings of
cooperation, peace, love,

00:13:12.920 --> 00:13:16.010 align:middle line:84%
and healing, what a
beautiful thing for us

00:13:16.010 --> 00:13:17.870 align:middle line:84%
not only to choose
that for the world,

00:13:17.870 --> 00:13:20.840 align:middle line:84%
but for us to claim it
for ourselves as well.

00:13:20.840 --> 00:13:26.620 align:middle line:84%
If we are, in my estimation,
abusing this power

00:13:26.620 --> 00:13:29.530 align:middle line:84%
to create harmful
things for other people,

00:13:29.530 --> 00:13:32.950 align:middle line:84%
we will experience that
harm, and it will destroy us

00:13:32.950 --> 00:13:35.350 align:middle line:84%
before it will ever have the
impact that many people are

00:13:35.350 --> 00:13:37.160 align:middle line:84%
concerned about in
the world around us--

00:13:37.160 --> 00:13:39.306 align:middle line:90%
nature's fail safe.

00:13:39.306 --> 00:13:40.180 align:middle line:90%
Does that make sense?

00:13:40.180 --> 00:13:40.300 align:middle line:90%
>> It does.

00:13:40.300 --> 00:13:40.860 align:middle line:10%
>> Have I answered that?

00:13:40.860 --> 00:13:40.960 align:middle line:10%
>> It's almost like--

00:13:40.960 --> 00:13:41.690 align:middle line:10%
>> I want to be brief.

00:13:41.690 --> 00:13:42.565 align:middle line:10%
I want to be concise.

00:13:42.565 --> 00:13:46.770 align:middle line:84%
>> No, it is, and basically,
we create our own feelings,

00:13:46.770 --> 00:13:49.440 align:middle line:84%
so we can tell if
they're our own or not.

00:13:49.440 --> 00:13:51.870 align:middle line:10%
>> Well, if the question
is, is this feeling my own,

00:13:51.870 --> 00:13:54.270 align:middle line:10%
this is the power of harmonizing
the heart and the brain.

00:13:54.270 --> 00:13:57.960 align:middle line:84%
Any experience-- this is a
beautiful question of where

00:13:57.960 --> 00:14:02.740 align:middle line:84%
we've been taught to feel
disempowered when in fact,

00:14:02.740 --> 00:14:07.180 align:middle line:84%
we are empowered to go
in and ask, specifically,

00:14:07.180 --> 00:14:07.990 align:middle line:90%
these kinds of--

00:14:07.990 --> 00:14:09.865 align:middle line:84%
when there's no one else
to ask, when there's

00:14:09.865 --> 00:14:11.380 align:middle line:90%
no book to ask and everybody--

00:14:11.380 --> 00:14:14.350 align:middle line:84%
I have friends who
have health issues,

00:14:14.350 --> 00:14:16.931 align:middle line:84%
and every one of their
friends is giving them

00:14:16.931 --> 00:14:18.430 align:middle line:84%
advice that's
different, and they're

00:14:18.430 --> 00:14:19.721 align:middle line:90%
pulled in a million directions.

00:14:19.721 --> 00:14:21.430 align:middle line:90%
Drink this.

00:14:21.430 --> 00:14:22.880 align:middle line:90%
Smoke this.

00:14:22.880 --> 00:14:24.460 align:middle line:90%
Wear one of these crystals.

00:14:24.460 --> 00:14:26.712 align:middle line:84%
Eat this-- they're all
good for some things,

00:14:26.712 --> 00:14:28.420 align:middle line:84%
but how do you know
what's right for you?

00:14:28.420 --> 00:14:31.390 align:middle line:84%
Nobody can tell you, and this
is one of those times where

00:14:31.390 --> 00:14:32.620 align:middle line:90%
nobody can tell you.

00:14:32.620 --> 00:14:34.786 align:middle line:84%
This is where you harmonize
the heart and the brain.

00:14:34.786 --> 00:14:37.360 align:middle line:84%
You go into your heart
wisdom and you ask what's

00:14:37.360 --> 00:14:39.820 align:middle line:90%
right for you in this moment.

00:14:39.820 --> 00:14:42.675 align:middle line:84%
Part of my heritage is
Cherokee, Southeastern Cherokee,

00:14:42.675 --> 00:14:44.675 align:middle line:84%
and there's a word for
what we're talking about.

00:14:44.675 --> 00:14:46.550 align:middle line:90%
It's called [CHEROKEE].

00:14:46.550 --> 00:14:49.420 align:middle line:84%
[CHEROKEE] means the
single eye of the heart--

00:14:49.420 --> 00:14:53.140 align:middle line:84%
the eye that knows what's
right for you in this moment--

00:14:53.140 --> 00:14:56.110 align:middle line:84%
not for your neighbor, not for
your parents or your sibling,

00:14:56.110 --> 00:14:57.820 align:middle line:90%
only for you in this moment.

00:14:57.820 --> 00:14:59.660 align:middle line:84%
And this question is
a perfect example.

00:14:59.660 --> 00:15:02.650 align:middle line:84%
If you want to know what
it is that you're hearing,

00:15:02.650 --> 00:15:06.100 align:middle line:84%
go into your heart and ask, and
you're empowered to do that.

00:15:06.100 --> 00:15:07.630 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes, thank you.

00:15:07.630 --> 00:15:10.690 align:middle line:84%
Let's talk about the
amazing doctors in China

00:15:10.690 --> 00:15:12.400 align:middle line:90%
that healed the tumor.

00:15:12.400 --> 00:15:15.160 align:middle line:84%
So Javier U. wants
to know, have you

00:15:15.160 --> 00:15:17.860 align:middle line:84%
learned to heal yourself
with the power of belief,

00:15:17.860 --> 00:15:20.760 align:middle line:84%
as seen with the tumor with all
the doctors surrounding the one

00:15:20.760 --> 00:15:21.560 align:middle line:90%
lady?

00:15:21.560 --> 00:15:23.920 align:middle line:84%
>> My answer is it
goes beyond belief.

00:15:23.920 --> 00:15:25.560 align:middle line:90%
It is claiming.

00:15:25.560 --> 00:15:27.700 align:middle line:84%
There is the belief
that it's possible,

00:15:27.700 --> 00:15:30.710 align:middle line:84%
and then there's the
claiming it in our lives.

00:15:30.710 --> 00:15:32.380 align:middle line:90%
What I showed in the film--

00:15:32.380 --> 00:15:34.840 align:middle line:90%
these were Qigong masters.

00:15:34.840 --> 00:15:36.790 align:middle line:84%
And I studied with the
man that made the film,

00:15:36.790 --> 00:15:39.010 align:middle line:84%
so I've experienced personally,
and I have applied it

00:15:39.010 --> 00:15:41.166 align:middle line:84%
in my own life, and I've
talked about it in some

00:15:41.166 --> 00:15:42.390 align:middle line:90%
of my books and programs.

00:15:42.390 --> 00:15:45.400 align:middle line:84%
It is quantum healing, and we
can answer this now because

00:15:45.400 --> 00:15:47.020 align:middle line:90%
of the previous questions.

00:15:47.020 --> 00:15:49.780 align:middle line:84%
What they are doing in
that film is an example

00:15:49.780 --> 00:15:53.830 align:middle line:84%
of what we spoke about three
questions ago, of reaching

00:15:53.830 --> 00:15:56.500 align:middle line:84%
into the quantum field
of all possibilities,

00:15:56.500 --> 00:16:01.280 align:middle line:84%
claiming the one that
has already happened.

00:16:01.280 --> 00:16:05.140 align:middle line:84%
And with the power of
those three practitioners,

00:16:05.140 --> 00:16:08.090 align:middle line:84%
who are attuned to
the human energy field

00:16:08.090 --> 00:16:13.000 align:middle line:84%
and to what we would call the
pranic energy field, of making

00:16:13.000 --> 00:16:15.010 align:middle line:90%
that possibility a reality--

00:16:15.010 --> 00:16:19.510 align:middle line:84%
in the "Missing Link"
series, I showed the film,

00:16:19.510 --> 00:16:21.820 align:middle line:84%
where we could see
with an ultrasound--

00:16:21.820 --> 00:16:23.650 align:middle line:84%
the sonogram-- inside
the body of a living

00:16:23.650 --> 00:16:28.680 align:middle line:84%
woman whose condition changed
in 2 minutes and 40 seconds.

00:16:28.680 --> 00:16:31.060 align:middle line:84%
What you were seeing at
2 minutes and 40 seconds

00:16:31.060 --> 00:16:34.120 align:middle line:84%
is how quickly that
quantum possibility

00:16:34.120 --> 00:16:36.250 align:middle line:84%
can replace an
existing possibility

00:16:36.250 --> 00:16:38.950 align:middle line:90%
because it's all quantum.

00:16:38.950 --> 00:16:40.430 align:middle line:84%
Have I applied it
in my own life?

00:16:40.430 --> 00:16:41.500 align:middle line:90%
I'll just be very candid.

00:16:41.500 --> 00:16:42.300 align:middle line:90%
The answer is yes.

00:16:42.300 --> 00:16:46.870 align:middle line:84%
In the year 2000, at a
routine medical exam,

00:16:46.870 --> 00:16:49.270 align:middle line:84%
I was told I had
something inside my body

00:16:49.270 --> 00:16:51.940 align:middle line:84%
that shouldn't be there,
in my bladder, after I'd

00:16:51.940 --> 00:16:55.310 align:middle line:84%
been seeing this film for years
in front of live audiences,

00:16:55.310 --> 00:16:57.400 align:middle line:90%
and I needed surgery.

00:16:57.400 --> 00:17:00.460 align:middle line:90%
And I said, give me two weeks.

00:17:00.460 --> 00:17:03.400 align:middle line:84%
And I applied everything
that I've ever learned,

00:17:03.400 --> 00:17:07.660 align:middle line:84%
but still, I had that little
doubt that we often have.

00:17:07.660 --> 00:17:09.640 align:middle line:84%
And I said, how do
I know if it's real?

00:17:09.640 --> 00:17:13.240 align:middle line:84%
I went to the Mayo Clinic
in Jacksonville, Florida,

00:17:13.240 --> 00:17:16.089 align:middle line:84%
and actually underwent
what we thought

00:17:16.089 --> 00:17:17.890 align:middle line:90%
was going to be a procedure.

00:17:17.890 --> 00:17:20.140 align:middle line:84%
And I was anesthetized,
and when I woke up,

00:17:20.140 --> 00:17:22.222 align:middle line:84%
the doctor was saying
to me, why are you here?

00:17:22.222 --> 00:17:23.680 align:middle line:84%
And I said, well,
what do you mean?

00:17:23.680 --> 00:17:25.874 align:middle line:84%
And he said, there's
nothing to remove.

00:17:25.874 --> 00:17:27.040 align:middle line:90%
There's no sign that it was.

00:17:27.040 --> 00:17:27.840 align:middle line:90%
There's no redness.

00:17:27.840 --> 00:17:29.830 align:middle line:90%
There's no scarring.

00:17:29.830 --> 00:17:31.379 align:middle line:84%
And he was trying
to figure out why

00:17:31.379 --> 00:17:32.920 align:middle line:84%
his team was working
on somebody that

00:17:32.920 --> 00:17:34.810 align:middle line:90%
didn't need to be worked on.

00:17:34.810 --> 00:17:37.210 align:middle line:84%
I was anesthetized,
so I was trying

00:17:37.210 --> 00:17:42.340 align:middle line:84%
to explain to him about
quantum healing and medicine--

00:17:42.340 --> 00:17:45.310 align:middle line:84%
this hospital in Beijing,
China, as he turned to walk out

00:17:45.310 --> 00:17:49.572 align:middle line:84%
the door because there's
nothing in his belief system

00:17:49.572 --> 00:17:51.070 align:middle line:90%
where that would fit.

00:17:51.070 --> 00:17:55.989 align:middle line:84%
So the answer is I have applied
it in my own life, and I do--

00:17:55.989 --> 00:17:58.030 align:middle line:84%
rather than trying to
apply it, I try to live it.

00:17:58.030 --> 00:17:58.880 align:middle line:90%
I do my very best.

00:17:58.880 --> 00:17:59.680 align:middle line:90%
And I'm a student.

00:17:59.680 --> 00:18:00.850 align:middle line:90%
I'm learning.

00:18:00.850 --> 00:18:03.790 align:middle line:84%
I'll learn 'til my
last day on Earth.

00:18:03.790 --> 00:18:06.550 align:middle line:84%
But I think the best
we can do is not

00:18:06.550 --> 00:18:10.720 align:middle line:84%
to discount the wisdom of
those who have come before us,

00:18:10.720 --> 00:18:12.360 align:middle line:84%
but to embrace it
where it makes sense.

00:18:12.360 --> 00:18:14.443 align:middle line:84%
Marry it with the best
science of the modern world

00:18:14.443 --> 00:18:16.160 align:middle line:84%
to be the best people
that we can be.

00:18:16.160 --> 00:18:16.570 align:middle line:90%
>> Love it.

00:18:16.570 --> 00:18:17.370 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:18:17.370 --> 00:18:18.385 align:middle line:90%
That's awesome.

00:18:18.385 --> 00:18:20.680 align:middle line:84%
And I love that you said
that you're always learning.

00:18:20.680 --> 00:18:24.890 align:middle line:84%
I heard a quote the other
day that teachers always

00:18:24.890 --> 00:18:25.690 align:middle line:90%
have teachers.

00:18:25.690 --> 00:18:26.606 align:middle line:90%
It doesn't stop there.

00:18:26.606 --> 00:18:28.010 align:middle line:90%
There's always another level.

00:18:28.010 --> 00:18:29.500 align:middle line:90%
So it's beautiful.

00:18:29.500 --> 00:18:33.040 align:middle line:84%
DJ Walker wants to know a little
bit more about 3-D reality.

00:18:33.040 --> 00:18:37.630 align:middle line:84%
So she or he says, I'm
trying to maintain a lift-off

00:18:37.630 --> 00:18:39.340 align:middle line:90%
from the 3-D reality.

00:18:39.340 --> 00:18:41.270 align:middle line:90%
I've stopped watching TV.

00:18:41.270 --> 00:18:43.540 align:middle line:84%
So the question is,
what vision can I

00:18:43.540 --> 00:18:46.450 align:middle line:84%
maintain in my mind
of a future dimension?

00:18:46.450 --> 00:18:49.450 align:middle line:84%
>> If I'm understanding
what's asked,

00:18:49.450 --> 00:18:55.180 align:middle line:84%
what vision DJ can maintain
is the vision that brings joy

00:18:55.180 --> 00:18:58.710 align:middle line:84%
to his or her heart and
that makes their soul sing,

00:18:58.710 --> 00:19:00.170 align:middle line:90%
and this is the beauty.

00:19:00.170 --> 00:19:01.200 align:middle line:90%
We have personal vision.

00:19:01.200 --> 00:19:03.520 align:middle line:90%
We have collective vision.

00:19:03.520 --> 00:19:08.296 align:middle line:84%
I couldn't possibly tell this
individual what vision to hold.

00:19:08.296 --> 00:19:09.670 align:middle line:84%
And I'm not sure--
when they talk

00:19:09.670 --> 00:19:11.950 align:middle line:84%
about a dimensional
reality, I'm not sure

00:19:11.950 --> 00:19:14.582 align:middle line:84%
exactly where the
question fits into that.

00:19:14.582 --> 00:19:16.540 align:middle line:84%
So I may not be doing
justice to this question.

00:19:16.540 --> 00:19:19.240 align:middle line:90%


00:19:19.240 --> 00:19:24.190 align:middle line:84%
We live in a three-dimensional
world, and we're here.

00:19:24.190 --> 00:19:25.600 align:middle line:90%
That's our reality.

00:19:25.600 --> 00:19:28.782 align:middle line:84%
We also live in other
dimensions simultaneously.

00:19:28.782 --> 00:19:30.490 align:middle line:84%
When we go to sleep,
in our dream states,

00:19:30.490 --> 00:19:34.280 align:middle line:84%
we're in other
dimensions as well,

00:19:34.280 --> 00:19:35.860 align:middle line:90%
and they're all very real.

00:19:35.860 --> 00:19:40.570 align:middle line:84%
There are indigenous
tribes, some

00:19:40.570 --> 00:19:45.085 align:middle line:84%
that are in Africa, that spend
more time in the dream state

00:19:45.085 --> 00:19:46.210 align:middle line:90%
than they do in the waking.

00:19:46.210 --> 00:19:48.585 align:middle line:84%
They wake up every once in a
while to go to the bathroom,

00:19:48.585 --> 00:19:49.490 align:middle line:90%
get a bite to eat.

00:19:49.490 --> 00:19:53.560 align:middle line:84%
Their tribal business,
their elders,

00:19:53.560 --> 00:19:57.592 align:middle line:84%
their marriages-- they're all
arranged in the dream state.

00:19:57.592 --> 00:19:59.800 align:middle line:84%
If you and I were to go in
their tribe, we would look

00:19:59.800 --> 00:20:01.720 align:middle line:84%
and say, oh, they're
all sleeping.

00:20:01.720 --> 00:20:03.070 align:middle line:90%
It's a lucid dream.

00:20:03.070 --> 00:20:05.080 align:middle line:84%
They've learned to stay
awake in their dreams

00:20:05.080 --> 00:20:08.640 align:middle line:84%
in that altered state, and
they live much of their lives

00:20:08.640 --> 00:20:10.990 align:middle line:90%
in another dimensional reality.

00:20:10.990 --> 00:20:17.187 align:middle line:10%
We tune ours out, and we tend to
isolate one reality or another.

00:20:17.187 --> 00:20:18.520 align:middle line:90%
So it's an interesting question.

00:20:18.520 --> 00:20:20.320 align:middle line:84%
I'm not sure I've honored
it and done justice,

00:20:20.320 --> 00:20:22.153 align:middle line:84%
but that's what I'm
understanding right now.

00:20:22.153 --> 00:20:24.790 align:middle line:10%
>> I'm wondering if
it's more about--

00:20:24.790 --> 00:20:27.250 align:middle line:10%
what will you see in
this other dimension?

00:20:27.250 --> 00:20:30.040 align:middle line:84%
What should you be focusing
on if you know that--

00:20:30.040 --> 00:20:32.431 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, what the
evidence-- as a scientist--

00:20:32.431 --> 00:20:33.430 align:middle line:90%
I'm a trained scientist.

00:20:33.430 --> 00:20:35.410 align:middle line:84%
What the evidence suggests
in the other dimensions is

00:20:35.410 --> 00:20:36.868 align:middle line:84%
we won't be seeing
much of anything

00:20:36.868 --> 00:20:39.820 align:middle line:84%
because we won't use our eyes
the way we use our eyes now.

00:20:39.820 --> 00:20:44.830 align:middle line:84%
We use our eyes to
interpret signals of light

00:20:44.830 --> 00:20:47.050 align:middle line:84%
because we've separated
ourselves from our world.

00:20:47.050 --> 00:20:49.270 align:middle line:84%
In other dimensions,
we're not that separate.

00:20:49.270 --> 00:20:53.560 align:middle line:84%
So we become the
essence of that world.

00:20:53.560 --> 00:20:56.590 align:middle line:90%
We're not seeing it as separate.

00:20:56.590 --> 00:21:00.910 align:middle line:84%
>> Let's talk about
Kathryn question.

00:21:00.910 --> 00:21:04.420 align:middle line:84%
And I'm happy that she asked
this question because I just

00:21:04.420 --> 00:21:07.090 align:middle line:84%
think as Gaia and
a network, people

00:21:07.090 --> 00:21:11.195 align:middle line:84%
feel sometimes disconnected
when the people around them--

00:21:11.195 --> 00:21:13.810 align:middle line:84%
the people you grow up
with and go to school with,

00:21:13.810 --> 00:21:16.480 align:middle line:84%
go to church with,
have different opinions

00:21:16.480 --> 00:21:19.090 align:middle line:90%
about the heart-mind connection.

00:21:19.090 --> 00:21:21.120 align:middle line:84%
So let's talk
about her question.

00:21:21.120 --> 00:21:24.930 align:middle line:84%
She says, waking up can be
a lonely process for many.

00:21:24.930 --> 00:21:27.910 align:middle line:84%
Would you mind giving us your
top three most important things

00:21:27.910 --> 00:21:31.300 align:middle line:84%
to do to move forward once
you have come into your truth?

00:21:31.300 --> 00:21:34.300 align:middle line:84%
It seems to be really easy
to get stalled by fear,

00:21:34.300 --> 00:21:36.982 align:middle line:84%
even when you are aware that
fear is just an illusion.

00:21:36.982 --> 00:21:38.440 align:middle line:84%
>> I could give
those very quickly.

00:21:38.440 --> 00:21:42.296 align:middle line:84%
Live your truth, believe in your
truth, and trust your truth.

00:21:42.296 --> 00:21:44.800 align:middle line:84%
And what that means
to me, that she's

00:21:44.800 --> 00:21:46.640 align:middle line:84%
asking for the top
three things-- and those

00:21:46.640 --> 00:21:47.440 align:middle line:90%
are the top three.

00:21:47.440 --> 00:21:49.650 align:middle line:84%
Honest to God, they
just came to me right

00:21:49.650 --> 00:21:52.600 align:middle line:84%
as she was saying that,
and I think that's the key.

00:21:52.600 --> 00:21:55.120 align:middle line:90%
What I've found is this.

00:21:55.120 --> 00:21:59.360 align:middle line:84%
Everyone is waking
up because we're told

00:21:59.360 --> 00:22:01.460 align:middle line:90%
that this world is a dream.

00:22:01.460 --> 00:22:04.790 align:middle line:84%
So we're waking up from
a dream in some sense.

00:22:04.790 --> 00:22:06.740 align:middle line:84%
But just as we all
wake up differently

00:22:06.740 --> 00:22:08.330 align:middle line:84%
in the morning from
our bed, we all

00:22:08.330 --> 00:22:10.810 align:middle line:84%
wake up at different
times in different ways.

00:22:10.810 --> 00:22:15.360 align:middle line:84%
And we can't possibly judge
when or how or to what degree

00:22:15.360 --> 00:22:18.350 align:middle line:84%
another person is
awake because of--

00:22:18.350 --> 00:22:21.910 align:middle line:84%
choices they make in
one facet of their lives

00:22:21.910 --> 00:22:23.870 align:middle line:84%
may look to us like an
unconscious choice when

00:22:23.870 --> 00:22:25.490 align:middle line:84%
in another part of
their lives, they

00:22:25.490 --> 00:22:28.250 align:middle line:90%
may be so totally tuned in.

00:22:28.250 --> 00:22:30.410 align:middle line:84%
So my experience
is the best that we

00:22:30.410 --> 00:22:34.500 align:middle line:84%
can hope to do is live
our truths for ourselves.

00:22:34.500 --> 00:22:36.990 align:middle line:84%
And this is where
the workshop of life

00:22:36.990 --> 00:22:40.830 align:middle line:84%
begins, because it's easy to
live your truth when you're

00:22:40.830 --> 00:22:42.840 align:middle line:84%
in a New Age workshop
or you're isolated

00:22:42.840 --> 00:22:45.780 align:middle line:84%
in a monastery on a mountaintop
halfway around the world.

00:22:45.780 --> 00:22:47.490 align:middle line:90%
Where the challenge comes--

00:22:47.490 --> 00:22:48.930 align:middle line:90%
go to a public school.

00:22:48.930 --> 00:22:51.900 align:middle line:84%
Go to your place of work,
your employment, your friends,

00:22:51.900 --> 00:22:54.780 align:middle line:84%
your family, and
live what you know

00:22:54.780 --> 00:22:58.230 align:middle line:84%
to be true in the
presence of others,

00:22:58.230 --> 00:23:00.210 align:middle line:84%
regardless of their
beliefs or not.

00:23:00.210 --> 00:23:01.740 align:middle line:90%
But here's the key--

00:23:01.740 --> 00:23:07.410 align:middle line:84%
to live it in a way that's
kind, to be kind to others--

00:23:07.410 --> 00:23:11.580 align:middle line:84%
not critical, not judgmental
because someone else may not

00:23:11.580 --> 00:23:13.810 align:middle line:90%
see or think the same way.

00:23:13.810 --> 00:23:16.185 align:middle line:84%
This is where
compassion comes in.

00:23:16.185 --> 00:23:19.540 align:middle line:84%
But compassion is the
end of a sequence.

00:23:19.540 --> 00:23:23.910 align:middle line:90%
First, we must have sympathy.

00:23:23.910 --> 00:23:27.510 align:middle line:84%
Then we must have empathy
to gain compassion.

00:23:27.510 --> 00:23:30.270 align:middle line:84%
You cannot have compassion
without the empathy

00:23:30.270 --> 00:23:32.130 align:middle line:84%
and the sympathy, and
we've got to be able--

00:23:32.130 --> 00:23:35.610 align:middle line:84%
you have to sympathize with
someone else who's having

00:23:35.610 --> 00:23:37.660 align:middle line:90%
a difficult time.

00:23:37.660 --> 00:23:39.680 align:middle line:84%
That's recognizing
the suffering.

00:23:39.680 --> 00:23:43.290 align:middle line:84%
Empathizing is feeling
that suffering with us--

00:23:43.290 --> 00:23:44.090 align:middle line:90%
with them.

00:23:44.090 --> 00:23:47.690 align:middle line:84%
Compassion is the
ability to witness

00:23:47.690 --> 00:23:49.970 align:middle line:84%
the suffering of another
without judging it

00:23:49.970 --> 00:23:53.270 align:middle line:84%
and without getting
lost in the suffering.

00:23:53.270 --> 00:23:57.320 align:middle line:84%
So this is where those people,
the very situation that she's

00:23:57.320 --> 00:24:00.590 align:middle line:84%
describing, is our greatest
workshop, because it's

00:24:00.590 --> 00:24:04.824 align:middle line:84%
where we learn to be
and live our own truth

00:24:04.824 --> 00:24:06.740 align:middle line:84%
in the presence of a
world that doesn't always

00:24:06.740 --> 00:24:08.510 align:middle line:90%
support that truth.

00:24:08.510 --> 00:24:11.590 align:middle line:84%
You know, a place where
I get this a lot--

00:24:11.590 --> 00:24:14.120 align:middle line:84%
I hired-- well, it
was a consultant--

00:24:14.120 --> 00:24:16.727 align:middle line:84%
to come into some
of our workshops,

00:24:16.727 --> 00:24:18.560 align:middle line:84%
because I wanted to see
who my audience was.

00:24:18.560 --> 00:24:20.518 align:middle line:84%
And they did focus groups
and things like that,

00:24:20.518 --> 00:24:23.060 align:middle line:84%
and they compiled a beautifully
bound volume of pie charts

00:24:23.060 --> 00:24:26.152 align:middle line:84%
and bar charts of age
groups and demographics.

00:24:26.152 --> 00:24:28.610 align:middle line:84%
One of the things they found,
we have a lot of young people

00:24:28.610 --> 00:24:30.419 align:middle line:84%
that come with their
parents, and sometimes

00:24:30.419 --> 00:24:32.960 align:middle line:84%
three generations, with their
parents and their grandparents,

00:24:32.960 --> 00:24:34.580 align:middle line:90%
to our events.

00:24:34.580 --> 00:24:36.630 align:middle line:84%
And the young people--
here's what they say.

00:24:36.630 --> 00:24:38.720 align:middle line:90%
They say, Gregg-- or Mr. Braden.

00:24:38.720 --> 00:24:40.025 align:middle line:90%
I said, please call me Gregg.

00:24:40.025 --> 00:24:41.900 align:middle line:84%
I don't know when I
became a Mr. I'm not sure

00:24:41.900 --> 00:24:42.700 align:middle line:90%
when that happened.

00:24:42.700 --> 00:24:44.300 align:middle line:90%
[CHUCKLING]

00:24:44.300 --> 00:24:48.650 align:middle line:84%
They say, it's easy to
live the way that you're

00:24:48.650 --> 00:24:50.510 align:middle line:84%
talking about in this
room with these people

00:24:50.510 --> 00:24:52.910 align:middle line:84%
because we all believe
the same thing.

00:24:52.910 --> 00:24:56.260 align:middle line:84%
But when I go to my school,
nobody thinks this way.

00:24:56.260 --> 00:24:59.210 align:middle line:84%
And this is where a young
person will be tested,

00:24:59.210 --> 00:25:00.837 align:middle line:84%
and this is where,
in my opinion,

00:25:00.837 --> 00:25:03.170 align:middle line:84%
the parents can give them the
guidance and the strength.

00:25:03.170 --> 00:25:06.080 align:middle line:84%
If they know that what I
call a spiritual rock--

00:25:06.080 --> 00:25:09.740 align:middle line:84%
if they know that their
spiritual rock is who they are

00:25:09.740 --> 00:25:12.800 align:middle line:84%
in this world and what
their life is all about

00:25:12.800 --> 00:25:17.570 align:middle line:84%
because they've been through
the guidance of their parents--

00:25:17.570 --> 00:25:19.550 align:middle line:90%
have given them those values--

00:25:19.550 --> 00:25:21.140 align:middle line:84%
then when they go
into a situation

00:25:21.140 --> 00:25:23.660 align:middle line:84%
where that's not supported,
it's not a problem for them.

00:25:23.660 --> 00:25:26.840 align:middle line:84%
It's when they are
vulnerable, when they're lost,

00:25:26.840 --> 00:25:29.600 align:middle line:84%
when they don't have that
identity and they go to school

00:25:29.600 --> 00:25:32.410 align:middle line:84%
and they want to be
with the in crowd,

00:25:32.410 --> 00:25:35.420 align:middle line:84%
with their doing the drugs
or the cyber-bullying

00:25:35.420 --> 00:25:36.712 align:middle line:90%
or whatever it is.

00:25:36.712 --> 00:25:37.920 align:middle line:90%
They don't know who they are.

00:25:37.920 --> 00:25:40.980 align:middle line:84%
That's where they become more
susceptible to those things.

00:25:40.980 --> 00:25:44.660 align:middle line:84%
So the things that we're talking
about on a very spiritual level

00:25:44.660 --> 00:25:47.180 align:middle line:84%
have a very practical
application in our lives.

00:25:47.180 --> 00:25:50.720 align:middle line:84%
When we know who we are,
it's much easier for us

00:25:50.720 --> 00:25:52.140 align:middle line:90%
to live our truth.

00:25:52.140 --> 00:25:52.940 align:middle line:90%
>> Well, thank you.

00:25:52.940 --> 00:25:57.440 align:middle line:84%
It's obvious that you
were drawn to the sciences

00:25:57.440 --> 00:26:02.180 align:middle line:84%
for some reason, so Cherie wants
to know, how and when did it

00:26:02.180 --> 00:26:05.570 align:middle line:84%
occur to you personally that
all these aspects of history,

00:26:05.570 --> 00:26:09.380 align:middle line:84%
spirituality, and science
were all connected?

00:26:09.380 --> 00:26:10.700 align:middle line:90%
>> Well, that's a big question.

00:26:10.700 --> 00:26:14.190 align:middle line:90%


00:26:14.190 --> 00:26:16.640 align:middle line:84%
I've answered this in some of
the social media interviews

00:26:16.640 --> 00:26:20.880 align:middle line:84%
that we've had, and it's
no secret to our audience.

00:26:20.880 --> 00:26:22.550 align:middle line:84%
I come from a very
dysfunctional,

00:26:22.550 --> 00:26:23.420 align:middle line:90%
alcoholic family.

00:26:23.420 --> 00:26:25.525 align:middle line:90%
Father was alcoholic.

00:26:25.525 --> 00:26:26.900 align:middle line:84%
He left our family
when I was 10.

00:26:26.900 --> 00:26:31.400 align:middle line:84%
Science and music were the
refuge for me, in that order.

00:26:31.400 --> 00:26:34.040 align:middle line:84%
I became a scientist
at the age of five--

00:26:34.040 --> 00:26:36.620 align:middle line:84%
didn't have the
degree, obviously.

00:26:36.620 --> 00:26:40.430 align:middle line:84%
So science has always
been a very powerful--

00:26:40.430 --> 00:26:43.310 align:middle line:84%
played a very powerful role in
my life, and I've been drawn--

00:26:43.310 --> 00:26:45.560 align:middle line:84%
I knew from the time I was
five years old that I would

00:26:45.560 --> 00:26:47.067 align:middle line:90%
be a geologist, and I was.

00:26:47.067 --> 00:26:48.650 align:middle line:84%
I also thought I
might be a rock star,

00:26:48.650 --> 00:26:50.590 align:middle line:84%
and I'm still thinking
about that one.

00:26:50.590 --> 00:26:53.180 align:middle line:90%
But the role of science--

00:26:53.180 --> 00:26:55.330 align:middle line:84%
the reason I think
it's important

00:26:55.330 --> 00:26:58.670 align:middle line:84%
is because science
is a language.

00:26:58.670 --> 00:27:00.180 align:middle line:90%
It's only one language.

00:27:00.180 --> 00:27:01.910 align:middle line:84%
It's a way of
interpreting our world.

00:27:01.910 --> 00:27:05.000 align:middle line:84%
And for us to make
the kind of changes

00:27:05.000 --> 00:27:06.970 align:middle line:84%
that we all hope
for in the world,

00:27:06.970 --> 00:27:10.610 align:middle line:84%
to have the cooperation
and the peace,

00:27:10.610 --> 00:27:13.670 align:middle line:84%
the sharing, and the equitable
kind of world we have,

00:27:13.670 --> 00:27:16.320 align:middle line:84%
we've got to think differently
than we ever have before.

00:27:16.320 --> 00:27:18.710 align:middle line:84%
And people, I think, are
willing to do that if they

00:27:18.710 --> 00:27:20.630 align:middle line:90%
are given a reason.

00:27:20.630 --> 00:27:23.180 align:middle line:90%
Science is a neutral language.

00:27:23.180 --> 00:27:25.460 align:middle line:84%
It's not charged with
religious connotations

00:27:25.460 --> 00:27:27.390 align:middle line:90%
or with New Age connotations.

00:27:27.390 --> 00:27:30.200 align:middle line:84%
So science is a way of honoring
my audience through what

00:27:30.200 --> 00:27:32.450 align:middle line:90%
I've come to understand.

00:27:32.450 --> 00:27:33.830 align:middle line:90%
I began at five years old.

00:27:33.830 --> 00:27:36.452 align:middle line:84%
I formalized it with
my degree later on.

00:27:36.452 --> 00:27:37.910 align:middle line:84%
But I also want to
be really clear.

00:27:37.910 --> 00:27:39.830 align:middle line:84%
Science doesn't have
all the answers.

00:27:39.830 --> 00:27:40.680 align:middle line:90%
Science is new.

00:27:40.680 --> 00:27:41.960 align:middle line:90%
It's only 300 years old.

00:27:41.960 --> 00:27:44.210 align:middle line:84%
Spirituality is over
5,000 years old.

00:27:44.210 --> 00:27:46.800 align:middle line:84%
We've had spiritual
understandings.

00:27:46.800 --> 00:27:51.020 align:middle line:84%
So I think we owe it to
ourselves to draw upon every

00:27:51.020 --> 00:27:54.470 align:middle line:84%
iota of information that's
available to us today--

00:27:54.470 --> 00:27:57.710 align:middle line:84%
because we're in uncharted
territory in our world--

00:27:57.710 --> 00:28:02.750 align:middle line:84%
to draw upon everything to be
honest, truthful, and factual.

00:28:02.750 --> 00:28:04.750 align:middle line:84%
With the material that's
real, hang onto it.

00:28:04.750 --> 00:28:06.560 align:middle line:84%
With the stuff that's
not real, let it go.

00:28:06.560 --> 00:28:07.580 align:middle line:90%
That comes to healing.

00:28:07.580 --> 00:28:09.050 align:middle line:90%
That comes to peace.

00:28:09.050 --> 00:28:11.360 align:middle line:90%
That comes to free energy.

00:28:11.360 --> 00:28:13.580 align:middle line:84%
It comes to medicine,
all of those things.

00:28:13.580 --> 00:28:16.250 align:middle line:84%
And allow the science
and the spirituality

00:28:16.250 --> 00:28:20.060 align:middle line:84%
to come together to marry
the two into a wisdom that's

00:28:20.060 --> 00:28:22.250 align:middle line:84%
greater than science
could ever be alone

00:28:22.250 --> 00:28:24.380 align:middle line:84%
or that spirituality
could be on its own

00:28:24.380 --> 00:28:27.080 align:middle line:84%
to give us the evolutionary
edge to thrive--

00:28:27.080 --> 00:28:29.900 align:middle line:84%
to thrive, not just survive--
thrive in the new world that's

00:28:29.900 --> 00:28:31.220 align:middle line:90%
at our doorstep right now.

00:28:31.220 --> 00:28:34.170 align:middle line:84%
>> I'm just so thankful for
science to help back these

00:28:34.170 --> 00:28:36.606 align:middle line:90%
spiritual facts, really.

00:28:36.606 --> 00:28:38.480 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, science can
help us know what's real

00:28:38.480 --> 00:28:39.280 align:middle line:90%
and what's not.

00:28:39.280 --> 00:28:41.864 align:middle line:84%
And if it's not real,
then stop doing it.

00:28:41.864 --> 00:28:44.030 align:middle line:84%
>> So thank you so much for
being here again, Gregg.

00:28:44.030 --> 00:28:45.440 align:middle line:90%
It's so great to have you.

00:28:45.440 --> 00:28:48.170 align:middle line:84%
Thanks for answering the
viewers' questions and spending

00:28:48.170 --> 00:28:49.010 align:middle line:90%
time with me today.

00:28:49.010 --> 00:28:50.134 align:middle line:90%
>> Tiffany, you're awesome.

00:28:50.134 --> 00:28:53.150 align:middle line:10%
You're a very easy person to
work with on these questions,

00:28:53.150 --> 00:28:55.610 align:middle line:10%
and I'm excited to honor our
audience through answering

00:28:55.610 --> 00:28:56.410 align:middle line:10%
some of these.

00:28:56.410 --> 00:28:57.650 align:middle line:10%
Thanks for making that possible.

00:28:57.650 --> 00:28:58.450 align:middle line:10%
>> Of course.

00:28:58.450 --> 00:28:59.870 align:middle line:10%
That's all we have for today.

00:28:59.870 --> 00:29:01.450 align:middle line:10%
