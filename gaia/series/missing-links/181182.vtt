00:00:11.808 --> 00:00:24.330 align:middle line:90%


00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:25.130 align:middle line:90%
>> Hello.

00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:26.330 align:middle line:90%
My name's Gregg Braden.

00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:29.060 align:middle line:10%
And I'd like to welcome you to
this very special presentation

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:32.330 align:middle line:10%
of The Divine Matrix,
bridging time, space,

00:00:32.330 --> 00:00:34.160 align:middle line:10%
miracles in belief.

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:36.620 align:middle line:84%
In the last episode,
we saw the evidence

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:40.010 align:middle line:84%
for a universal field of
energy, the matrix, that

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:43.400 align:middle line:84%
provides the container for
everything in our lives.

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:45.470 align:middle line:84%
It also provides the
bridge between our inner

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:47.750 align:middle line:84%
and our outer worlds
and the mirror

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:51.780 align:middle line:84%
for our deepest and truest
beliefs in the world around us.

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:54.410 align:middle line:84%
Well, in this episode
we'll turn our attention

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:56.960 align:middle line:84%
to how the matrix
works, the rules, that

00:00:56.960 --> 00:00:59.890 align:middle line:84%
determine what's possible in
the world, as well as our body.

00:00:59.890 --> 00:01:02.870 align:middle line:90%


00:01:02.870 --> 00:01:05.700 align:middle line:84%
It was a Sunday
evening in 2003 when

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:10.470 align:middle line:84%
Hei Young had a feeling about
her son Ron, a premonition.

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:13.470 align:middle line:84%
At the very instant that
she was having the feeling,

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:16.530 align:middle line:84%
he was on a military mission
just outside of Baghdad

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:17.820 align:middle line:90%
in Iraq.

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:20.130 align:middle line:84%
He was piloting an
Apache helicopter

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:22.080 align:middle line:90%
that would been shot down.

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:25.200 align:middle line:84%
I wanted to share with you, in
her own words, precisely what

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:27.930 align:middle line:84%
it is that Hei felt as she
shared in an interview that

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:29.850 align:middle line:90%
happened later.

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:32.400 align:middle line:84%
She said, "I just had
a mother's feeling.

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:35.350 align:middle line:10%
I felt like Ron
was there with me.

00:01:35.350 --> 00:01:36.930 align:middle line:90%
I felt like he was there.

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:39.920 align:middle line:90%
And he put his arms around me."

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:41.850 align:middle line:84%
Well, not long after
she had the feeling,

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:43.680 align:middle line:90%
her fears were confirmed.

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:45.990 align:middle line:84%
There was a knock at
the door, and that visit

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:48.990 align:middle line:84%
from a military
entourage told her

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:50.690 align:middle line:90%
what she didn't want to hear--

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:52.920 align:middle line:84%
that Ron's helicopter
had been shot down.

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:55.462 align:middle line:84%
And he and another
pilot had gone missing.

00:01:55.462 --> 00:01:56.920 align:middle line:84%
And their whereabouts
were unknown.

00:01:56.920 --> 00:01:59.520 align:middle line:84%
He was missing in
action at that time.

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:01.650 align:middle line:84%
It was only on a
news broadcast that

00:02:01.650 --> 00:02:04.890 align:middle line:84%
happened later that evening
from a Middle Eastern station

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:08.820 align:middle line:84%
that she saw the film footage
of her son and the other pilot.

00:02:08.820 --> 00:02:10.870 align:middle line:90%
They were being held captive.

00:02:10.870 --> 00:02:13.650 align:middle line:84%
The good news is
that they were alive.

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:17.440 align:middle line:84%
When Kay saw that news footage,
she screamed out, "I knew it.

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:18.280 align:middle line:90%
I knew it.

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:19.080 align:middle line:90%
I knew it."

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:22.390 align:middle line:84%
Three times because her
intuition was right on.

00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:25.500 align:middle line:84%
She knew that her son was in
trouble before anyone had ever

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:26.640 align:middle line:90%
told her.

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:29.010 align:middle line:84%
The question is,
how did she know?

00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:32.610 align:middle line:84%
What is it that conveys the
information from our loved ones

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:34.980 align:middle line:84%
happening in one
place in the world,

00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:38.300 align:middle line:84%
halfway across the nation,
or halfway across the planet?

00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:39.990 align:middle line:84%
And what is it within
us that receives

00:02:39.990 --> 00:02:43.360 align:middle line:84%
that information in a
way that is meaningful,

00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:46.590 align:middle line:84%
that we can interpret as a
message the way that we do?

00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:48.660 align:middle line:84%
Well, the good news
is that Ron's story

00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:50.510 align:middle line:90%
has a really happy ending.

00:02:50.510 --> 00:02:52.830 align:middle line:84%
In one of the most
daring military missions

00:02:52.830 --> 00:02:56.430 align:middle line:84%
during the war, Ron, as
well as five other POWs,

00:02:56.430 --> 00:02:59.370 align:middle line:84%
were rescued in April
of the same year.

00:02:59.370 --> 00:03:01.485 align:middle line:84%
And all of them were
reunited with their families.

00:03:01.485 --> 00:03:05.010 align:middle line:90%


00:03:05.010 --> 00:03:08.660 align:middle line:84%
When we hear about stories
like Kay and her son Ron

00:03:08.660 --> 00:03:12.280 align:middle line:84%
and we have these familiar
experiences in our lives,

00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:14.370 align:middle line:84%
what is it that's really
happening and would

00:03:14.370 --> 00:03:17.470 align:middle line:84%
become so accustomed to
the experience itself?

00:03:17.470 --> 00:03:22.240 align:middle line:84%
Do we ever really consider how
that experience is unfolding?

00:03:22.240 --> 00:03:26.220 align:middle line:84%
What is it that allows us to
be in such a deep connection

00:03:26.220 --> 00:03:28.590 align:middle line:90%
with a loved one so far away?

00:03:28.590 --> 00:03:30.660 align:middle line:84%
Well, you already know
the answer to this

00:03:30.660 --> 00:03:32.280 align:middle line:84%
because the science
has determined--

00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:36.240 align:middle line:84%
as we saw in the last episode,
in Episode 1 of this series--

00:03:36.240 --> 00:03:39.580 align:middle line:84%
when two things are once
physically connected,

00:03:39.580 --> 00:03:42.330 align:middle line:84%
even though they become
separate energetically,

00:03:42.330 --> 00:03:43.920 align:middle line:90%
they are still connected.

00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:45.960 align:middle line:84%
The connection is
the entanglement.

00:03:45.960 --> 00:03:49.080 align:middle line:84%
Ron and his mother
were entangled,

00:03:49.080 --> 00:03:52.230 align:middle line:84%
as well as you and your
mother, me and my mother,

00:03:52.230 --> 00:03:53.130 align:middle line:90%
and our loved ones.

00:03:53.130 --> 00:03:56.430 align:middle line:84%
And this entanglement allows
us to have connections

00:03:56.430 --> 00:03:58.740 align:middle line:84%
and interactions on this
very, very subtle level

00:03:58.740 --> 00:04:00.930 align:middle line:90%
that sometimes we discount.

00:04:00.930 --> 00:04:03.510 align:middle line:84%
But sometimes, they play
a very, very powerful role

00:04:03.510 --> 00:04:04.980 align:middle line:90%
in our lives.

00:04:04.980 --> 00:04:08.700 align:middle line:84%
Well, this first rule of
The Divine Matrix, this

00:04:08.700 --> 00:04:10.710 align:middle line:84%
is the rule that
tells us precisely

00:04:10.710 --> 00:04:12.370 align:middle line:90%
why this connection happens.

00:04:12.370 --> 00:04:13.950 align:middle line:84%
And I'm just going
to reiterate--

00:04:13.950 --> 00:04:17.760 align:middle line:84%
when something is
once joined, even

00:04:17.760 --> 00:04:19.649 align:middle line:84%
though that something
becomes separate,

00:04:19.649 --> 00:04:22.470 align:middle line:84%
physically, energetically,
it remains connected.

00:04:22.470 --> 00:04:25.620 align:middle line:84%
This is the first rule
of The Divine Matrix.

00:04:25.620 --> 00:04:27.570 align:middle line:84%
But in addition to
the entanglement,

00:04:27.570 --> 00:04:30.210 align:middle line:84%
there is another principle,
a second principle,

00:04:30.210 --> 00:04:33.300 align:middle line:84%
in a divine matrix that allows
these kinds of experiences

00:04:33.300 --> 00:04:34.900 align:middle line:90%
to happen as well.

00:04:34.900 --> 00:04:38.640 align:middle line:84%
And I'd like to share
this rule of the matrix

00:04:38.640 --> 00:04:42.270 align:middle line:84%
from a poetic perspective
from William Blake.

00:04:42.270 --> 00:04:45.260 align:middle line:84%
"To see a world in
a grain of sand,

00:04:45.260 --> 00:04:48.750 align:middle line:84%
and heaven in a
wildflower, hold infinity

00:04:48.750 --> 00:04:53.710 align:middle line:84%
in the palm of your hand
and eternity in an hour."

00:04:53.710 --> 00:04:56.050 align:middle line:84%
What is William
Blake telling us?

00:04:56.050 --> 00:04:59.060 align:middle line:84%
He's describing from
a poetic perspective

00:04:59.060 --> 00:05:03.280 align:middle line:84%
the second very, very powerful
rule of The Divine Matrix.

00:05:03.280 --> 00:05:06.130 align:middle line:84%
The Divine Matrix
is holographic.

00:05:06.130 --> 00:05:09.550 align:middle line:84%
And William Blake is talking
to us about the hologram.

00:05:09.550 --> 00:05:12.640 align:middle line:84%
Now, I know that the term
"hologram," it's a common word,

00:05:12.640 --> 00:05:14.540 align:middle line:90%
and we hear it used frequently.

00:05:14.540 --> 00:05:17.530 align:middle line:84%
But I also know that different
people use it in different ways

00:05:17.530 --> 00:05:19.390 align:middle line:90%
to describe different things.

00:05:19.390 --> 00:05:22.180 align:middle line:84%
So I'd like to be really
clear about precisely

00:05:22.180 --> 00:05:23.960 align:middle line:90%
what a hologram is.

00:05:23.960 --> 00:05:27.430 align:middle line:84%
So the definition
of a true hologram

00:05:27.430 --> 00:05:31.900 align:middle line:84%
is that for every piece of
something, in that piece,

00:05:31.900 --> 00:05:34.337 align:middle line:84%
the rest of the
something is reflected.

00:05:34.337 --> 00:05:36.670 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to share this with
you in three different ways

00:05:36.670 --> 00:05:39.010 align:middle line:84%
just to give you three
different perspectives of what

00:05:39.010 --> 00:05:40.480 align:middle line:90%
this means.

00:05:40.480 --> 00:05:43.030 align:middle line:84%
In previous episodes
of "Missing Links,"

00:05:43.030 --> 00:05:46.630 align:middle line:84%
I shared with you one
example of a bookmark.

00:05:46.630 --> 00:05:50.950 align:middle line:10%
So back in the 1980s,
holographic bookmarks

00:05:50.950 --> 00:05:54.280 align:middle line:10%
were becoming very, very popular
with the new thought movement.

00:05:54.280 --> 00:05:57.210 align:middle line:84%
We saw these amazing
holographic bookmarks

00:05:57.210 --> 00:06:01.090 align:middle line:84%
of dolphins jumping over
pyramids, or of Mother Mary,

00:06:01.090 --> 00:06:04.880 align:middle line:90%
or of a rose in full bloom.

00:06:04.880 --> 00:06:06.580 align:middle line:84%
And these were
holographic bookmarks.

00:06:06.580 --> 00:06:08.121 align:middle line:84%
When you held them
in the light, they

00:06:08.121 --> 00:06:10.510 align:middle line:84%
looked as if they were
hovering above your hand

00:06:10.510 --> 00:06:12.310 align:middle line:90%
while you were holding them.

00:06:12.310 --> 00:06:14.020 align:middle line:84%
Well, in a true
hologram, I'm going

00:06:14.020 --> 00:06:16.080 align:middle line:84%
to give you an example
with a bookmark,

00:06:16.080 --> 00:06:18.445 align:middle line:84%
and then, I'm going to
apply it to our bodies.

00:06:18.445 --> 00:06:20.320 align:middle line:84%
And then, I'm going to
apply it to our brain.

00:06:20.320 --> 00:06:22.850 align:middle line:84%
And then, I'm going to apply
it to the universe around us.

00:06:22.850 --> 00:06:25.456 align:middle line:84%
So from different perspectives,
we all learn differently.

00:06:25.456 --> 00:06:26.830 align:middle line:84%
And this is why
it's good to have

00:06:26.830 --> 00:06:28.930 align:middle line:90%
so many different perspectives.

00:06:28.930 --> 00:06:31.880 align:middle line:84%
In a true hologram,
here's what happens.

00:06:31.880 --> 00:06:34.510 align:middle line:84%
You can take one of those
beautiful, shiny, and

00:06:34.510 --> 00:06:36.730 align:middle line:84%
holographic bookmarks,
and you can cut it

00:06:36.730 --> 00:06:39.310 align:middle line:90%
into a million different pieces.

00:06:39.310 --> 00:06:42.060 align:middle line:84%
And with each of those
million different pieces,

00:06:42.060 --> 00:06:43.630 align:middle line:90%
you put them under a microscope.

00:06:43.630 --> 00:06:46.690 align:middle line:84%
If it is a true hologram,
under the microscope,

00:06:46.690 --> 00:06:51.320 align:middle line:84%
you will see the entire image
reproduced in that fraction

00:06:51.320 --> 00:06:55.109 align:middle line:84%
because the fraction
always holds the whole.

00:06:55.109 --> 00:06:56.650 align:middle line:84%
This is what William
Blake was saying

00:06:56.650 --> 00:06:59.380 align:middle line:90%
to us in the grain of sand.

00:06:59.380 --> 00:07:02.770 align:middle line:84%
So when we see these
holographic images,

00:07:02.770 --> 00:07:06.130 align:middle line:84%
these holographic bookmarks,
what they're telling us,

00:07:06.130 --> 00:07:10.750 align:middle line:84%
they're reminding us of a
principle that actually allows

00:07:10.750 --> 00:07:14.290 align:middle line:84%
us to function in this matrix
in the way that Kay and her son

00:07:14.290 --> 00:07:16.390 align:middle line:84%
did, as I just
described earlier,

00:07:16.390 --> 00:07:18.250 align:middle line:90%
through their intuition.

00:07:18.250 --> 00:07:23.860 align:middle line:10%
Well, it wasn't until the 1990s,
when this holographic principle

00:07:23.860 --> 00:07:26.620 align:middle line:10%
went beyond just the
bookmarks, that scientists

00:07:26.620 --> 00:07:30.640 align:middle line:10%
began to understand that it
applies to our bodies as well.

00:07:30.640 --> 00:07:32.350 align:middle line:84%
The holographic
principle gives us

00:07:32.350 --> 00:07:36.810 align:middle line:84%
a clue as to why a
change in your DNA

00:07:36.810 --> 00:07:39.710 align:middle line:84%
can be reflected throughout
your body as quickly as it is.

00:07:39.710 --> 00:07:41.320 align:middle line:84%
And I want you to
think about this.

00:07:41.320 --> 00:07:45.520 align:middle line:84%
The average human body has
about 50 trillion cells

00:07:45.520 --> 00:07:47.770 align:middle line:84%
in the body-- so
50 trillion cells

00:07:47.770 --> 00:07:51.980 align:middle line:84%
that have the DNA within
them for the average person.

00:07:51.980 --> 00:07:55.600 align:middle line:84%
If you made a
change in one cell,

00:07:55.600 --> 00:08:01.330 align:middle line:84%
and that change had to be
reflected cell by cell by cell

00:08:01.330 --> 00:08:04.400 align:middle line:84%
for the whole body
to mirror the change,

00:08:04.400 --> 00:08:06.190 align:middle line:84%
think about how long
that would take.

00:08:06.190 --> 00:08:09.610 align:middle line:84%
50 trillion cells-- if
it even took one second

00:08:09.610 --> 00:08:11.620 align:middle line:84%
for every one of those
50 trillion cells

00:08:11.620 --> 00:08:13.551 align:middle line:84%
to reflect the change,
I can tell you,

00:08:13.551 --> 00:08:14.800 align:middle line:90%
you don't have to do the math.

00:08:14.800 --> 00:08:15.880 align:middle line:90%
I've done it for you.

00:08:15.880 --> 00:08:22.030 align:middle line:10%
It would take 1,585,600
years for one change

00:08:22.030 --> 00:08:25.120 align:middle line:10%
in your DNA to be reflected
throughout your body.

00:08:25.120 --> 00:08:27.640 align:middle line:84%
But you know that it
doesn't happen that way.

00:08:27.640 --> 00:08:31.210 align:middle line:84%
When we receive a
vaccination, for example,

00:08:31.210 --> 00:08:33.880 align:middle line:84%
it happens very, very
quickly that our body

00:08:33.880 --> 00:08:36.669 align:middle line:84%
begins to reflect what's
happening in that vaccine--

00:08:36.669 --> 00:08:39.700 align:middle line:84%
or if our cells are
modified in any way.

00:08:39.700 --> 00:08:41.679 align:middle line:84%
And it's because of the
holographic principle--

00:08:41.679 --> 00:08:44.760 align:middle line:84%
our DNA is holographic
within our bodies.

00:08:44.760 --> 00:08:46.930 align:middle line:84%
But let me give you an
even deeper example when

00:08:46.930 --> 00:08:48.920 align:middle line:90%
it comes to the brain.

00:08:48.920 --> 00:08:51.130 align:middle line:10%
There was a time when I
was studying biology--

00:08:51.130 --> 00:08:54.850 align:middle line:10%
again, back in
the 1960s, 1970s--

00:08:54.850 --> 00:08:58.360 align:middle line:10%
when I was taught
that the brain has

00:08:58.360 --> 00:09:00.130 align:middle line:10%
very specific parts
of the brain that

00:09:00.130 --> 00:09:02.980 align:middle line:10%
do very specific functions.

00:09:02.980 --> 00:09:05.230 align:middle line:10%
And if we lose that
part of the brain,

00:09:05.230 --> 00:09:07.270 align:middle line:10%
that we lose that function.

00:09:07.270 --> 00:09:11.050 align:middle line:10%
Well, it was through the work of
pioneering neuroscientist Karl

00:09:11.050 --> 00:09:15.460 align:middle line:10%
Pribram and physicist David Bohm
that we discovered that this

00:09:15.460 --> 00:09:16.940 align:middle line:10%
simply is not the case.

00:09:16.940 --> 00:09:21.640 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't work quite the way
we had been led to believe.

00:09:21.640 --> 00:09:25.000 align:middle line:84%
During their experiments,
they showed that our brain

00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:26.980 align:middle line:90%
is holographic as well.

00:09:26.980 --> 00:09:29.590 align:middle line:84%
What happened was that
there was research

00:09:29.590 --> 00:09:31.510 align:middle line:84%
that was being done
when laboratory

00:09:31.510 --> 00:09:34.600 align:middle line:84%
animals, for example, would lose
a certain part of their brain

00:09:34.600 --> 00:09:36.970 align:middle line:84%
that had been
believed to perform

00:09:36.970 --> 00:09:38.366 align:middle line:90%
only a certain function.

00:09:38.366 --> 00:09:40.990 align:middle line:84%
So maybe there is a part of the
brain that was used for speech,

00:09:40.990 --> 00:09:44.330 align:middle line:84%
or part of the brain that
was used for motor function.

00:09:44.330 --> 00:09:46.450 align:middle line:84%
The old thinking says,
if that part of the brain

00:09:46.450 --> 00:09:49.690 align:middle line:84%
no longer exists, that
that function is lost.

00:09:49.690 --> 00:09:51.970 align:middle line:84%
It's not what was happening
in the experiments.

00:09:51.970 --> 00:09:53.920 align:middle line:84%
When a specific
part of the brain

00:09:53.920 --> 00:09:56.650 align:middle line:84%
was damaged, or in some
cases even removed,

00:09:56.650 --> 00:10:01.360 align:middle line:84%
other parts of the brain began
to reflect the characteristics

00:10:01.360 --> 00:10:04.060 align:middle line:84%
that were present in the
part of the brain that

00:10:04.060 --> 00:10:06.160 align:middle line:90%
was no longer there.

00:10:06.160 --> 00:10:11.380 align:middle line:84%
This led the scientists to
hypothesize-- maybe the brain

00:10:11.380 --> 00:10:12.850 align:middle line:90%
is not as linear as we think.

00:10:12.850 --> 00:10:14.710 align:middle line:90%
Maybe it is holographic.

00:10:14.710 --> 00:10:16.150 align:middle line:90%
So they began to do experiments.

00:10:16.150 --> 00:10:18.670 align:middle line:84%
And I'll tell you
exactly how this works.

00:10:18.670 --> 00:10:20.560 align:middle line:90%
Karl Pribram postulated.

00:10:20.560 --> 00:10:23.830 align:middle line:84%
He hypothesized that
since the brain releases

00:10:23.830 --> 00:10:26.029 align:middle line:84%
electromagnetic
fields of energy,

00:10:26.029 --> 00:10:27.820 align:middle line:84%
that we should be able
to take those fields

00:10:27.820 --> 00:10:30.430 align:middle line:84%
and analyze them as we do other
fields through what's called

00:10:30.430 --> 00:10:32.350 align:middle line:90%
a Fast Fourier Transform.

00:10:32.350 --> 00:10:34.790 align:middle line:84%
And in doing that, what they
found is the information

00:10:34.790 --> 00:10:36.940 align:middle line:84%
the brain is
actually distributed.

00:10:36.940 --> 00:10:40.450 align:middle line:84%
And I want to share with you,
in his own words, Karl Pribram's

00:10:40.450 --> 00:10:44.320 align:middle line:84%
words, what this
distribution is all about.

00:10:44.320 --> 00:10:46.270 align:middle line:84%
He said that quote,
"the holograms

00:10:46.270 --> 00:10:49.090 align:middle line:84%
within the visual
system are what

00:10:49.090 --> 00:10:51.010 align:middle line:90%
are called 'patch' holograms."

00:10:51.010 --> 00:10:52.200 align:middle line:90%
End of quote.

00:10:52.200 --> 00:10:54.700 align:middle line:84%
A patch hologram--
what does that mean?

00:10:54.700 --> 00:10:57.400 align:middle line:84%
If you've ever seen
the eye of an insect,

00:10:57.400 --> 00:11:00.030 align:middle line:84%
like a fly for example,
there's a single eye.

00:11:00.030 --> 00:11:02.440 align:middle line:10%
But the eye has multiple lenses.

00:11:02.440 --> 00:11:06.200 align:middle line:84%
Each lens is
interpreting the reality.

00:11:06.200 --> 00:11:09.400 align:middle line:84%
But it's feeding into the
brain as a single image

00:11:09.400 --> 00:11:12.130 align:middle line:84%
of the insect, of
the fly for example.

00:11:12.130 --> 00:11:15.100 align:middle line:84%
It appears our brains work
in a very similar way.

00:11:15.100 --> 00:11:18.130 align:middle line:84%
It's not through our eyes,
but through our perceptions.

00:11:18.130 --> 00:11:19.810 align:middle line:84%
Patch holograms
within the brain,

00:11:19.810 --> 00:11:22.840 align:middle line:84%
they are feeding into
the common perception.

00:11:22.840 --> 00:11:25.540 align:middle line:84%
So I'm sharing this
with you because it

00:11:25.540 --> 00:11:29.990 align:middle line:84%
is this potential of the
hologram in our bodies,

00:11:29.990 --> 00:11:34.030 align:middle line:84%
in our DNA, and the principle
that I'm describing that I just

00:11:34.030 --> 00:11:35.500 align:middle line:90%
described in the bookmark.

00:11:35.500 --> 00:11:40.090 align:middle line:84%
These principles are all
playing out in the matrix,

00:11:40.090 --> 00:11:43.540 align:middle line:84%
in the field that surrounds
us, the field that

00:11:43.540 --> 00:11:45.310 align:middle line:90%
permeates our bodies.

00:11:45.310 --> 00:11:48.730 align:middle line:84%
We are living in a
holographic reality.

00:11:48.730 --> 00:11:50.497 align:middle line:84%
Now, I know you've
heard that before.

00:11:50.497 --> 00:11:52.455 align:middle line:84%
And the words, as I said,
mean different things

00:11:52.455 --> 00:11:53.840 align:middle line:90%
to different people.

00:11:53.840 --> 00:11:55.810 align:middle line:84%
And I'm hoping to bring
a new understanding

00:11:55.810 --> 00:11:57.460 align:middle line:84%
to the potential
of what this can

00:11:57.460 --> 00:12:00.890 align:middle line:90%
mean in your life and my life.

00:12:00.890 --> 00:12:02.900 align:middle line:84%
The holographic
principle gives us

00:12:02.900 --> 00:12:06.260 align:middle line:84%
a clue as to some of the
very potent possibilities

00:12:06.260 --> 00:12:07.060 align:middle line:90%
in our lives.

00:12:07.060 --> 00:12:10.760 align:middle line:84%
And let me just use one
other example to help

00:12:10.760 --> 00:12:12.490 align:middle line:90%
understand what this means.

00:12:12.490 --> 00:12:15.800 align:middle line:84%
And we'll begin applying
this in our lives.

00:12:15.800 --> 00:12:22.100 align:middle line:84%
In 1972, there was a study that
was done with 24 United States

00:12:22.100 --> 00:12:23.060 align:middle line:90%
cities.

00:12:23.060 --> 00:12:26.490 align:middle line:84%
Each city had populations
of over 10,000 people.

00:12:26.490 --> 00:12:31.340 align:middle line:84%
The study was done by the TM
people, the Transcendental

00:12:31.340 --> 00:12:34.790 align:middle line:90%
Meditation Research Lab.

00:12:34.790 --> 00:12:38.360 align:middle line:84%
And the purpose of the
study was to determine

00:12:38.360 --> 00:12:44.600 align:middle line:84%
if people trained in
TM and who are actually

00:12:44.600 --> 00:12:49.580 align:middle line:84%
using TM techniques within
a specific window of time,

00:12:49.580 --> 00:12:52.130 align:middle line:84%
if they had the
ability to influence

00:12:52.130 --> 00:12:55.730 align:middle line:84%
what was happening in the
world beyond their bodies.

00:12:55.730 --> 00:12:59.240 align:middle line:84%
So they were using TM to
create peace and balance

00:12:59.240 --> 00:13:01.070 align:middle line:90%
within themselves.

00:13:01.070 --> 00:13:04.580 align:middle line:84%
The experiment was designed to
see if that peace and balance

00:13:04.580 --> 00:13:06.830 align:middle line:84%
somehow went beyond
their physical bodies

00:13:06.830 --> 00:13:08.630 align:middle line:90%
into the world around them.

00:13:08.630 --> 00:13:11.220 align:middle line:84%
Well, the results of this
study were astounding.

00:13:11.220 --> 00:13:14.150 align:middle line:84%
And what they showed was that
during the window of time--

00:13:14.150 --> 00:13:21.080 align:middle line:84%
when the facilitators who were
trained in the practice of TM--

00:13:21.080 --> 00:13:24.770 align:middle line:84%
when they went into
their meditative states,

00:13:24.770 --> 00:13:29.540 align:middle line:84%
statistically significant
changes happened in the world

00:13:29.540 --> 00:13:30.560 align:middle line:90%
around them.

00:13:30.560 --> 00:13:32.720 align:middle line:10%
Emergency hospital
room visits declined.

00:13:32.720 --> 00:13:34.610 align:middle line:90%
Traffic accidents declined.

00:13:34.610 --> 00:13:36.950 align:middle line:90%
Crimes against people declined.

00:13:36.950 --> 00:13:37.760 align:middle line:90%
And here's the key.

00:13:37.760 --> 00:13:39.500 align:middle line:84%
When they stopped
what they were doing,

00:13:39.500 --> 00:13:41.910 align:middle line:90%
all those statistics reversed.

00:13:41.910 --> 00:13:44.060 align:middle line:84%
Well, this
understanding, and this

00:13:44.060 --> 00:13:48.170 align:middle line:84%
is a holographic principle
that is in place functioning

00:13:48.170 --> 00:13:49.580 align:middle line:84%
in the world--
this principle was

00:13:49.580 --> 00:13:52.550 align:middle line:84%
taken to an even
larger experiment that

00:13:52.550 --> 00:13:55.820 align:middle line:84%
was done in the Middle East
during the war between Lebanon

00:13:55.820 --> 00:13:57.742 align:middle line:90%
and Israel in the 1980s.

00:13:57.742 --> 00:13:59.450 align:middle line:84%
And it was called the
International Peace

00:13:59.450 --> 00:14:01.520 align:middle line:90%
Project in the Middle East.

00:14:01.520 --> 00:14:04.250 align:middle line:84%
The same thing, a same
protocol, was used.

00:14:04.250 --> 00:14:08.750 align:middle line:84%
People who were specifically--
these were experts in TM--

00:14:08.750 --> 00:14:12.290 align:middle line:84%
and they were trained within
a specific window of time

00:14:12.290 --> 00:14:17.240 align:middle line:84%
to create peace within
their physical bodies

00:14:17.240 --> 00:14:20.210 align:middle line:84%
to create peace
through the TM process.

00:14:20.210 --> 00:14:24.440 align:middle line:84%
And while they were doing
this in the world around them,

00:14:24.440 --> 00:14:27.710 align:middle line:84%
statistically significant
results occurred.

00:14:27.710 --> 00:14:31.340 align:middle line:84%
Terrorist activities
dropped to zero while they

00:14:31.340 --> 00:14:33.290 align:middle line:90%
were in their meditative state.

00:14:33.290 --> 00:14:35.090 align:middle line:84%
Once again, violent
crimes, crimes

00:14:35.090 --> 00:14:37.610 align:middle line:84%
against people, emergency
hospital room visits,

00:14:37.610 --> 00:14:40.160 align:middle line:84%
traffic accidents--
all declined.

00:14:40.160 --> 00:14:43.070 align:middle line:84%
And when they stopped
what they were doing,

00:14:43.070 --> 00:14:45.000 align:middle line:90%
all of the statistics changed.

00:14:45.000 --> 00:14:47.540 align:middle line:84%
So a couple of things that
I want to point out here

00:14:47.540 --> 00:14:48.420 align:middle line:90%
about this study.

00:14:48.420 --> 00:14:51.280 align:middle line:84%
First of all, it
illustrates a very powerful,

00:14:51.280 --> 00:14:55.920 align:middle line:84%
a very powerful
principle, in that

00:14:55.920 --> 00:15:01.670 align:middle line:84%
the piece that was being
created is less about something

00:15:01.670 --> 00:15:03.420 align:middle line:90%
that we do in a moment in time.

00:15:03.420 --> 00:15:07.200 align:middle line:84%
It's more about something
that we become in our lives.

00:15:07.200 --> 00:15:10.760 align:middle line:84%
The matrix, the
field is reflecting

00:15:10.760 --> 00:15:14.520 align:middle line:84%
what it is that we have
become in our bodies.

00:15:14.520 --> 00:15:18.230 align:middle line:84%
If we are that peace only for
a window of time, when we stop,

00:15:18.230 --> 00:15:20.360 align:middle line:84%
of course, it's going
to stop being reflected

00:15:20.360 --> 00:15:21.720 align:middle line:90%
in the world around us.

00:15:21.720 --> 00:15:23.540 align:middle line:84%
So rather than
something that we do,

00:15:23.540 --> 00:15:26.120 align:middle line:84%
the invitation is for
peace to become something

00:15:26.120 --> 00:15:28.250 align:middle line:84%
that we become to the
best of our ability.

00:15:28.250 --> 00:15:29.570 align:middle line:90%
That's number 1.

00:15:29.570 --> 00:15:33.620 align:middle line:84%
Number 2, mathematically,
what the researchers found

00:15:33.620 --> 00:15:36.140 align:middle line:84%
was a formula for
how many people

00:15:36.140 --> 00:15:38.630 align:middle line:84%
it would take in a
given geographic area

00:15:38.630 --> 00:15:40.760 align:middle line:90%
to facilitate the peace.

00:15:40.760 --> 00:15:43.100 align:middle line:84%
So the formula they
came up with originally

00:15:43.100 --> 00:15:47.120 align:middle line:84%
was the square root of
1% of a given population.

00:15:47.120 --> 00:15:49.130 align:middle line:84%
That number is actually
a pretty small number--

00:15:49.130 --> 00:15:53.850 align:middle line:84%
the square root of 1%
of a given population.

00:15:53.850 --> 00:15:56.420 align:middle line:84%
Well, the reason that I'm
hesitating a little bit

00:15:56.420 --> 00:15:59.570 align:middle line:84%
as I share this with you is
because new studies have now

00:15:59.570 --> 00:16:03.170 align:middle line:84%
gone beyond this linear
thinking of a square root

00:16:03.170 --> 00:16:04.970 align:middle line:90%
of 1% of a given population.

00:16:04.970 --> 00:16:08.240 align:middle line:84%
It's less about the
numbers of people

00:16:08.240 --> 00:16:12.320 align:middle line:84%
and more about the quality
of the peace that's being

00:16:12.320 --> 00:16:13.940 align:middle line:90%
created within their bodies.

00:16:13.940 --> 00:16:18.080 align:middle line:84%
And the reason is because
of the holographic principle

00:16:18.080 --> 00:16:19.910 align:middle line:84%
that you and I are
exploring right now.

00:16:19.910 --> 00:16:23.690 align:middle line:84%
In the hologram, a relatively
small number of people

00:16:23.690 --> 00:16:28.100 align:middle line:84%
can create a powerful change
in the quantum hologram

00:16:28.100 --> 00:16:30.950 align:middle line:84%
as a result of the
clarity of whatever it

00:16:30.950 --> 00:16:33.440 align:middle line:84%
is that they have created
within their bodies-- the peace

00:16:33.440 --> 00:16:35.606 align:middle line:84%
or the healing that they
create within their bodies.

00:16:35.606 --> 00:16:40.090 align:middle line:90%


00:16:40.090 --> 00:16:43.490 align:middle line:84%
And this brings us to the second
rule of The Divine Matrix.

00:16:43.490 --> 00:16:46.940 align:middle line:84%
The first one is that
the matrix is entangled.

00:16:46.940 --> 00:16:50.270 align:middle line:84%
The second rule is that
the matrix is holographic.

00:16:50.270 --> 00:16:53.870 align:middle line:84%
And what that means is that
on the quantum level, when

00:16:53.870 --> 00:16:56.870 align:middle line:84%
a change is made in one
place in the hologram,

00:16:56.870 --> 00:17:00.150 align:middle line:84%
it is reflected
throughout the hologram.

00:17:00.150 --> 00:17:02.620 align:middle line:84%
So I want to take this
back to the experiment

00:17:02.620 --> 00:17:05.230 align:middle line:84%
that we did earlier in this
series, The Twin Photon

00:17:05.230 --> 00:17:06.440 align:middle line:90%
experiment.

00:17:06.440 --> 00:17:08.500 align:middle line:84%
And I asked you a trick
question in the past.

00:17:08.500 --> 00:17:12.190 align:middle line:84%
When the two photons were
separated by 14 miles--

00:17:12.190 --> 00:17:14.319 align:middle line:84%
they were in
laboratories in cities

00:17:14.319 --> 00:17:16.180 align:middle line:90%
that were 14 miles apart--

00:17:16.180 --> 00:17:17.859 align:middle line:90%
one photon had an experience.

00:17:17.859 --> 00:17:20.710 align:middle line:84%
The other one in
exactly the same time

00:17:20.710 --> 00:17:23.555 align:middle line:84%
had precisely the
same experience.

00:17:23.555 --> 00:17:24.680 align:middle line:90%
Here's what I mean by that.

00:17:24.680 --> 00:17:28.210 align:middle line:84%
If one of the photons was
given a specific charge,

00:17:28.210 --> 00:17:30.490 align:middle line:84%
the other one had
exactly the same charge.

00:17:30.490 --> 00:17:34.660 align:middle line:84%
If one photon was forced to
take a path in one direction

00:17:34.660 --> 00:17:36.640 align:middle line:84%
when two paths were
available, the other one

00:17:36.640 --> 00:17:38.900 align:middle line:84%
would take precisely
the same path,

00:17:38.900 --> 00:17:40.950 align:middle line:84%
even though another
path was available.

00:17:40.950 --> 00:17:44.020 align:middle line:84%
And the question was, how did
the information get from point

00:17:44.020 --> 00:17:46.400 align:middle line:84%
A to point B. In
the last episode,

00:17:46.400 --> 00:17:48.170 align:middle line:84%
I shared with you
that it didn't.

00:17:48.170 --> 00:17:50.290 align:middle line:84%
It was already there
because it's entangled.

00:17:50.290 --> 00:17:52.540 align:middle line:84%
The second piece
of this answer is

00:17:52.540 --> 00:17:55.720 align:middle line:84%
because of the holographic
nature of the field that

00:17:55.720 --> 00:17:57.820 align:middle line:90%
contains these photons.

00:17:57.820 --> 00:18:00.790 align:middle line:84%
When something is happening
in one place on the quantum

00:18:00.790 --> 00:18:01.600 align:middle line:90%
level--

00:18:01.600 --> 00:18:03.490 align:middle line:84%
and these are
quantum particles--

00:18:03.490 --> 00:18:08.350 align:middle line:84%
that change is reflected another
place in the quantum field.

00:18:08.350 --> 00:18:12.090 align:middle line:90%


00:18:12.090 --> 00:18:14.206 align:middle line:84%
So when it comes
to our relationship

00:18:14.206 --> 00:18:16.080 align:middle line:84%
with the world around
us and with what we now

00:18:16.080 --> 00:18:19.260 align:middle line:84%
know is this matrix,
this field of energy,

00:18:19.260 --> 00:18:22.320 align:middle line:84%
there've been two very,
very different perspectives

00:18:22.320 --> 00:18:25.260 align:middle line:84%
that scientists have
held in considering

00:18:25.260 --> 00:18:27.240 align:middle line:90%
our relationship to the field.

00:18:27.240 --> 00:18:31.170 align:middle line:84%
One of those perspectives
was held by Albert Einstein.

00:18:31.170 --> 00:18:34.290 align:middle line:84%
He believed that we are separate
from the world around us

00:18:34.290 --> 00:18:36.390 align:middle line:84%
and that we have very,
very little influence

00:18:36.390 --> 00:18:38.490 align:middle line:90%
on the world around us.

00:18:38.490 --> 00:18:42.180 align:middle line:84%
And I want to share with you,
in Einstein's own words, what

00:18:42.180 --> 00:18:43.890 align:middle line:90%
that perspective was.

00:18:43.890 --> 00:18:46.440 align:middle line:84%
Albert Einstein said,
and this is a quote,

00:18:46.440 --> 00:18:50.400 align:middle line:84%
"we live in a world which
exists independently of us

00:18:50.400 --> 00:18:53.460 align:middle line:84%
human beings, which
stands before us like

00:18:53.460 --> 00:18:56.850 align:middle line:84%
a great eternal riddle,
at least partially

00:18:56.850 --> 00:18:59.400 align:middle line:84%
accessible to our inspection
and our thinking."

00:18:59.400 --> 00:19:00.630 align:middle line:90%
End of quote.

00:19:00.630 --> 00:19:02.490 align:middle line:84%
And Einstein took
us even further

00:19:02.490 --> 00:19:07.020 align:middle line:84%
because when quantum physics
began to suggest that somehow,

00:19:07.020 --> 00:19:12.600 align:middle line:84%
we have within us the ability to
influence the world beyond us,

00:19:12.600 --> 00:19:16.770 align:middle line:84%
Einstein coined a very, very
specific word that has caught

00:19:16.770 --> 00:19:19.260 align:middle line:90%
on in the scientific lingo.

00:19:19.260 --> 00:19:23.070 align:middle line:84%
He called this spooky
action at a distance--

00:19:23.070 --> 00:19:25.300 align:middle line:90%
spooky action at a distance.

00:19:25.300 --> 00:19:29.460 align:middle line:84%
And Einstein struggled with
this relationship between us

00:19:29.460 --> 00:19:32.040 align:middle line:84%
and the quantum world
in the world around us.

00:19:32.040 --> 00:19:35.580 align:middle line:84%
He never could embrace
the possibility

00:19:35.580 --> 00:19:40.020 align:middle line:84%
that we somehow have something
to do with what's happening

00:19:40.020 --> 00:19:41.900 align:middle line:90%
in our physical world.

00:19:41.900 --> 00:19:44.670 align:middle line:84%
Well, at exactly the
same time that Einstein

00:19:44.670 --> 00:19:50.250 align:middle line:84%
held this perspective, a friend
of his, a peer, a colleague,

00:19:50.250 --> 00:19:52.260 align:middle line:84%
they worked with
exactly the same data.

00:19:52.260 --> 00:19:54.750 align:middle line:84%
They had the same equations,
the same information

00:19:54.750 --> 00:19:56.730 align:middle line:90%
in the same period of time.

00:19:56.730 --> 00:19:59.160 align:middle line:84%
But this colleague had a very,
very different perspective.

00:19:59.160 --> 00:20:01.830 align:middle line:10%
His name is Professor
John Wheeler.

00:20:01.830 --> 00:20:04.950 align:middle line:10%
He was working at Princeton
University, as well as

00:20:04.950 --> 00:20:06.720 align:middle line:10%
Albert Einstein.

00:20:06.720 --> 00:20:10.110 align:middle line:84%
Wheeler sensed that something
very, very different

00:20:10.110 --> 00:20:12.510 align:middle line:84%
was happening in this
relationship between us

00:20:12.510 --> 00:20:13.310 align:middle line:90%
and the matrix.

00:20:13.310 --> 00:20:16.120 align:middle line:84%
And also, I want to share
with you Wheeler's own words.

00:20:16.120 --> 00:20:17.700 align:middle line:90%
They're so powerful.

00:20:17.700 --> 00:20:22.710 align:middle line:84%
And while what he said may
seem commonplace in our world

00:20:22.710 --> 00:20:27.145 align:middle line:84%
today-- if you can think back
to the 1940s and 1950s, when

00:20:27.145 --> 00:20:29.520 align:middle line:84%
these scientists were making
these discoveries-- for John

00:20:29.520 --> 00:20:32.940 align:middle line:84%
Wheeler to have the
strength, and the fortitude,

00:20:32.940 --> 00:20:36.360 align:middle line:84%
and the courage to say in the
scientific community what it is

00:20:36.360 --> 00:20:39.420 align:middle line:84%
that you're about to hear in the
presence of a world that didn't

00:20:39.420 --> 00:20:42.540 align:middle line:84%
support his theories,
it gives us insight

00:20:42.540 --> 00:20:45.360 align:middle line:84%
into what a very
powerful man he was

00:20:45.360 --> 00:20:48.620 align:middle line:84%
and how powerful his insights
continue to be in our lives

00:20:48.620 --> 00:20:49.420 align:middle line:90%
today.

00:20:49.420 --> 00:20:51.480 align:middle line:10%
Listen to what
John Wheeler said.

00:20:51.480 --> 00:20:53.190 align:middle line:10%
Wheeler said, and
this is a quote.

00:20:53.190 --> 00:20:57.120 align:middle line:10%
He said, "we could not even
imagine a universe that did not

00:20:57.120 --> 00:21:00.810 align:middle line:10%
contain us as the observers."

00:21:00.810 --> 00:21:05.790 align:middle line:10%
He said, "because the very
building blocks of the universe

00:21:05.790 --> 00:21:12.030 align:middle line:10%
are the acts of us looking
and observing the universe."

00:21:12.030 --> 00:21:14.340 align:middle line:10%
Wheeler said, and
this is a quote,

00:21:14.340 --> 00:21:18.610 align:middle line:10%
"we are part of a universe
that is a work in progress.

00:21:18.610 --> 00:21:21.990 align:middle line:10%
We are tiny patches of the
universe looking at itself

00:21:21.990 --> 00:21:23.790 align:middle line:10%
and building itself."

00:21:23.790 --> 00:21:28.170 align:middle line:10%
We live in what he called
"a participatory universe."

00:21:28.170 --> 00:21:29.640 align:middle line:90%
I love this.

00:21:29.640 --> 00:21:33.180 align:middle line:84%
We live in a
participatory universe.

00:21:33.180 --> 00:21:35.580 align:middle line:84%
Think about what John
Wheeler has just said.

00:21:35.580 --> 00:21:41.250 align:middle line:84%
He said that the universe exists
because we are creating it

00:21:41.250 --> 00:21:42.480 align:middle line:90%
as we go along.

00:21:42.480 --> 00:21:45.600 align:middle line:84%
It's a very, very different idea
from conventional physics that

00:21:45.600 --> 00:21:47.970 align:middle line:84%
says the universe
was here first,

00:21:47.970 --> 00:21:51.330 align:middle line:84%
and we've come along
later as an afterthought,

00:21:51.330 --> 00:21:53.370 align:middle line:84%
and that we have
very little influence

00:21:53.370 --> 00:21:54.690 align:middle line:90%
in the world around us.

00:21:54.690 --> 00:21:57.990 align:middle line:84%
Wheeler is saying
that we are actually

00:21:57.990 --> 00:21:59.010 align:middle line:90%
building this universe.

00:21:59.010 --> 00:21:59.940 align:middle line:90%
It's not finished yet.

00:21:59.940 --> 00:22:04.230 align:middle line:84%
We are still building in
a participatory universe.

00:22:04.230 --> 00:22:07.650 align:middle line:84%
And I want to take just
a moment, just a moment,

00:22:07.650 --> 00:22:10.920 align:middle line:84%
and really dive in to
the implications of what

00:22:10.920 --> 00:22:12.810 align:middle line:90%
Wheeler has just said here.

00:22:12.810 --> 00:22:15.240 align:middle line:84%
What he's saying is
that we will probably

00:22:15.240 --> 00:22:17.940 align:middle line:84%
never find the smallest
particle in the universe.

00:22:17.940 --> 00:22:20.640 align:middle line:84%
The particle that they're
looking for at CERN,

00:22:20.640 --> 00:22:22.680 align:middle line:84%
he said, we'll probably
never find that.

00:22:22.680 --> 00:22:24.990 align:middle line:84%
He also is implying
that we will probably

00:22:24.990 --> 00:22:29.610 align:middle line:84%
never find the edge of the
universe and what's beyond.

00:22:29.610 --> 00:22:31.530 align:middle line:84%
We're building
machines, telescopes

00:22:31.530 --> 00:22:33.780 align:middle line:84%
that keep looking
further, and further,

00:22:33.780 --> 00:22:36.150 align:middle line:84%
and further to the
edge of the universe.

00:22:36.150 --> 00:22:37.830 align:middle line:84%
Wheeler is saying,
we'll never find it.

00:22:37.830 --> 00:22:38.790 align:middle line:90%
And here's why.

00:22:38.790 --> 00:22:40.420 align:middle line:90%
Here's what he's saying.

00:22:40.420 --> 00:22:42.240 align:middle line:90%
He's saying, the act--

00:22:42.240 --> 00:22:47.190 align:middle line:84%
it is the act of you
and I looking, peering

00:22:47.190 --> 00:22:50.430 align:middle line:84%
into the universe
with the expectation

00:22:50.430 --> 00:22:53.670 align:middle line:84%
that something exists
for us to see that is

00:22:53.670 --> 00:22:57.100 align:middle line:90%
an act of creation unto itself.

00:22:57.100 --> 00:23:01.020 align:middle line:84%
So the act of peering into
the smallest, smallest

00:23:01.020 --> 00:23:03.840 align:middle line:84%
particles of matter
with the expectation

00:23:03.840 --> 00:23:05.640 align:middle line:84%
that something is
there is always

00:23:05.640 --> 00:23:07.890 align:middle line:84%
going to put another
particle there for us to see.

00:23:07.890 --> 00:23:09.540 align:middle line:90%
That's exactly what's happening.

00:23:09.540 --> 00:23:12.010 align:middle line:84%
We build bigger
and bigger machines

00:23:12.010 --> 00:23:13.930 align:middle line:84%
with more and more
energy to collide

00:23:13.930 --> 00:23:16.550 align:middle line:84%
these quantum particles that
are breaking into a bazillion

00:23:16.550 --> 00:23:17.350 align:middle line:90%
pieces.

00:23:17.350 --> 00:23:19.780 align:middle line:84%
And every time,
scientists say, aha,

00:23:19.780 --> 00:23:21.640 align:middle line:84%
we've got the ultimate
smallest particle.

00:23:21.640 --> 00:23:25.030 align:middle line:84%
They look a little closer, and
there's something else there.

00:23:25.030 --> 00:23:27.670 align:middle line:10%
It wasn't long ago
scientist using

00:23:27.670 --> 00:23:30.040 align:middle line:10%
radio telescopes
believed they had

00:23:30.040 --> 00:23:31.690 align:middle line:10%
found the edge of the universe.

00:23:31.690 --> 00:23:34.720 align:middle line:10%
They said, we've
reached a boundary,

00:23:34.720 --> 00:23:36.220 align:middle line:10%
the edge of our
universe, that we've

00:23:36.220 --> 00:23:38.200 align:middle line:10%
got to build another
telescope to see

00:23:38.200 --> 00:23:39.850 align:middle line:10%
what's beyond the boundary.

00:23:39.850 --> 00:23:42.450 align:middle line:84%
And they built another,
more powerful telescope.

00:23:42.450 --> 00:23:44.200 align:middle line:84%
And now, they said,
oops, it wasn't really

00:23:44.200 --> 00:23:47.530 align:middle line:84%
the edge because there
is something beyond that.

00:23:47.530 --> 00:23:50.890 align:middle line:84%
What Wheeler is saying
to us, what he's telling

00:23:50.890 --> 00:23:54.970 align:middle line:84%
us is that our role
in The Divine Matrix

00:23:54.970 --> 00:23:59.930 align:middle line:84%
is a living, vibrant role,
where we are creating as we go.

00:23:59.930 --> 00:24:02.830 align:middle line:84%
So as we know the
rules of the Matrix,

00:24:02.830 --> 00:24:05.980 align:middle line:84%
it empowers us in terms
of how we interpret

00:24:05.980 --> 00:24:07.810 align:middle line:84%
what's happening in
our lives and what's

00:24:07.810 --> 00:24:08.800 align:middle line:90%
happening in our world.

00:24:08.800 --> 00:24:11.580 align:middle line:90%


00:24:11.580 --> 00:24:15.900 align:middle line:84%
So with these ideas in mind,
what John Wheeler is telling us

00:24:15.900 --> 00:24:19.410 align:middle line:84%
that we are living in a
participatory universe,

00:24:19.410 --> 00:24:23.400 align:middle line:84%
with the rules that we know
so far of the quantum matrix,

00:24:23.400 --> 00:24:25.680 align:middle line:84%
of the divine matrix--
number 1, it's entangled.

00:24:25.680 --> 00:24:28.290 align:middle line:90%
Number two, it's holographic.

00:24:28.290 --> 00:24:31.780 align:middle line:84%
Now, we come back to what the
abbot in Tibet said to us.

00:24:31.780 --> 00:24:33.610 align:middle line:90%
And it makes perfect sense.

00:24:33.610 --> 00:24:36.150 align:middle line:84%
We must become in
our lives what we

00:24:36.150 --> 00:24:39.810 align:middle line:84%
choose to experience in the
world, as well as our body.

00:24:39.810 --> 00:24:42.510 align:middle line:90%


00:24:42.510 --> 00:24:45.620 align:middle line:84%
So in addition to telling
us how this Matrix,

00:24:45.620 --> 00:24:50.150 align:middle line:84%
this field is receiving
information from us,

00:24:50.150 --> 00:24:52.160 align:middle line:84%
the new discoveries
are also telling us

00:24:52.160 --> 00:24:55.430 align:middle line:84%
how we receive information
from the field.

00:24:55.430 --> 00:24:57.650 align:middle line:84%
And every moment of
every day, you and I

00:24:57.650 --> 00:25:00.110 align:middle line:84%
are part of a conversation
that is unfolding.

00:25:00.110 --> 00:25:02.100 align:middle line:90%
It's a two-way conversation.

00:25:02.100 --> 00:25:05.360 align:middle line:84%
We are feeding information
into The Divine Matrix,

00:25:05.360 --> 00:25:07.580 align:middle line:84%
and it is giving
information back

00:25:07.580 --> 00:25:09.800 align:middle line:84%
about what it is
that we've said--

00:25:09.800 --> 00:25:13.190 align:middle line:84%
what we've said through our
thoughts, feelings, emotions,

00:25:13.190 --> 00:25:15.840 align:middle line:90%
and beliefs.

00:25:15.840 --> 00:25:18.420 align:middle line:84%
In the next episode, we'll
discover the elegant, yet

00:25:18.420 --> 00:25:20.550 align:middle line:84%
simple language
that the Matrix uses

00:25:20.550 --> 00:25:22.080 align:middle line:84%
to communicate with
you and me when

00:25:22.080 --> 00:25:24.930 align:middle line:84%
it comes to our beliefs,
our relationships, and even

00:25:24.930 --> 00:25:26.389 align:middle line:90%
the healing of our body.

00:25:26.389 --> 00:25:27.680 align:middle line:90%
Thank you for joining me today.
