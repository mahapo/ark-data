>>GREGG BRADEN: Hello.

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:27.360 align:middle line:10%
My name's Gregg Braden, and
I'd like to welcome you to this

00:00:27.360 --> 00:00:29.880 align:middle line:10%
all-new presentation
of "The Divine Matrix--

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:33.570 align:middle line:10%
Bridging Time, Space,
Miracles, and Belief."

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:37.410 align:middle line:84%
In the last episode, we saw
how the course of world events

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:40.500 align:middle line:84%
follows natural cycles that
can be known and calculated

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:42.660 align:middle line:90%
is what we called fractal time.

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:46.350 align:middle line:84%
Well, in this episode, we'll
apply these very principles

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:48.420 align:middle line:84%
on a personal level
as we discover

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:51.060 align:middle line:84%
the cyclic patterns
of our relationships

00:00:51.060 --> 00:00:54.030 align:middle line:84%
and the choice points for
the most potent opportunities

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:55.670 align:middle line:90%
of positive change in our lives.

00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:58.370 align:middle line:90%


00:00:58.370 --> 00:01:02.240 align:middle line:84%
I'd like to use a personal
example from my own life

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:04.489 align:middle line:84%
to demonstrate how
these cycles work

00:01:04.489 --> 00:01:07.970 align:middle line:84%
and how we can calculate
those repeat cycles.

00:01:07.970 --> 00:01:11.430 align:middle line:84%
So I'm going to begin with
an early time in my life.

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:15.300 align:middle line:84%
My father left our family
when I was 11 years old.

00:01:15.300 --> 00:01:18.890 align:middle line:10%
But it wasn't until 30 years
after that event that I fully

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:21.650 align:middle line:10%
understood the impact
that losing my father

00:01:21.650 --> 00:01:25.820 align:middle line:10%
had on my life, because
while I still knew in my mind

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:26.780 align:middle line:10%
that I had a family--

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:29.180 align:middle line:10%
I had a mom and my
younger brother--

00:01:29.180 --> 00:01:31.520 align:middle line:10%
I felt in my heart
something very different.

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:35.810 align:middle line:10%
My heart and my emotions said
that I had lost my family,

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:39.110 align:middle line:10%
that I had been betrayed by
what happened in my father

00:01:39.110 --> 00:01:40.790 align:middle line:10%
leaving the family.

00:01:40.790 --> 00:01:43.850 align:middle line:84%
Well, that feeling
of loss and betrayal

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:45.470 align:middle line:90%
planted the seed for a pattern.

00:01:45.470 --> 00:01:49.070 align:middle line:84%
It was a pattern of sabotage
for the relationships

00:01:49.070 --> 00:01:51.140 align:middle line:84%
that I loved and held
most dear in my life,

00:01:51.140 --> 00:01:54.230 align:middle line:90%
and it happened for decades.

00:01:54.230 --> 00:01:56.690 align:middle line:84%
It was this seed of
loss and betrayal

00:01:56.690 --> 00:01:59.570 align:middle line:84%
that will continue throughout
much of my adult life-- that

00:01:59.570 --> 00:02:02.150 align:middle line:84%
is, until I recognized
that pattern

00:02:02.150 --> 00:02:04.920 align:middle line:90%
and had the wisdom to change it.

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:06.850 align:middle line:84%
While using the
principles of fractal time

00:02:06.850 --> 00:02:11.770 align:middle line:84%
from the last episode, we can
build a time code calculator

00:02:11.770 --> 00:02:14.500 align:middle line:84%
to find out exactly
when we can expect

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:18.010 align:middle line:84%
the conditions of deep
emotional experience, like loss

00:02:18.010 --> 00:02:20.800 align:middle line:84%
and betrayal-- or even
positive experiences--

00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:23.450 align:middle line:90%
to repeat in our lives again.

00:02:23.450 --> 00:02:25.180 align:middle line:84%
So what I'd like to
do in this episode

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:29.380 align:middle line:84%
is I'd like to walk you through
the actual calculations, step

00:02:29.380 --> 00:02:32.020 align:middle line:84%
by step, so that you can
do these for yourself,

00:02:32.020 --> 00:02:34.570 align:middle line:84%
so you can calculate these
cycles in your own life.

00:02:34.570 --> 00:02:38.950 align:middle line:84%
Or, if you prefer, you can use
the handy time code calculator

00:02:38.950 --> 00:02:41.950 align:middle line:84%
that I've created that's
available on my website

00:02:41.950 --> 00:02:43.057 align:middle line:90%
for absolutely no charge.

00:02:43.057 --> 00:02:44.140 align:middle line:90%
You don't have to sign up.

00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:46.130 align:middle line:90%
There are no strings attached.

00:02:46.130 --> 00:02:50.000 align:middle line:84%
I just wanted to make it very
easy to use this algorithm.

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:52.930 align:middle line:10%
So if you go to the website
www.GreggBraden.com--

00:02:52.930 --> 00:02:55.570 align:middle line:10%
that's Gregg with two G's--

00:02:55.570 --> 00:02:59.590 align:middle line:10%
and you use mode number 3 as
it's described on the website,

00:02:59.590 --> 00:03:01.090 align:middle line:10%
you can plug in the
dates that we're

00:03:01.090 --> 00:03:05.590 align:middle line:10%
about to describe and have,
automated for you, the longer

00:03:05.590 --> 00:03:09.260 align:middle line:10%
system that we're about to
do right now, step by step.

00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:13.300 align:middle line:10%
So I'm going to invite
you to begin this process

00:03:13.300 --> 00:03:17.200 align:middle line:10%
by identifying an
age in your life

00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:21.280 align:middle line:10%
for a seed event
that is emotionally

00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:22.870 align:middle line:10%
significant in your life.

00:03:22.870 --> 00:03:24.640 align:middle line:10%
Now, it can be a positive event.

00:03:24.640 --> 00:03:26.500 align:middle line:90%
It can be a frightening event.

00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:29.140 align:middle line:84%
It can be a sad event
of loss or betrayal--

00:03:29.140 --> 00:03:31.810 align:middle line:84%
and I'm going to use my
father leaving my family,

00:03:31.810 --> 00:03:34.480 align:middle line:84%
as I said, for the example,
just to demonstrate

00:03:34.480 --> 00:03:36.140 align:middle line:90%
what's happening here.

00:03:36.140 --> 00:03:39.520 align:middle line:84%
So on a piece of paper,
in your mind's eye--

00:03:39.520 --> 00:03:42.070 align:middle line:84%
the first variable that
we're going to create

00:03:42.070 --> 00:03:44.650 align:middle line:84%
is a variable called
the Seed Event Age,

00:03:44.650 --> 00:03:49.660 align:middle line:84%
or SEA, and then a little 1 just
to the right and below-- sub 1.

00:03:49.660 --> 00:03:51.520 align:middle line:90%
So SEA sub 1.

00:03:51.520 --> 00:03:55.930 align:middle line:84%
So in my example, age
11 is the seed age

00:03:55.930 --> 00:03:57.910 align:middle line:90%
that we're going to begin with.

00:03:57.910 --> 00:04:02.980 align:middle line:84%
Step number 2-- we're using
the mathematics of nature

00:04:02.980 --> 00:04:05.440 align:middle line:84%
that we talked about in
the previous episode.

00:04:05.440 --> 00:04:09.250 align:middle line:84%
In this case, I'm going to
use the phi ratio of your age.

00:04:09.250 --> 00:04:12.440 align:middle line:84%
Now, in other programs, we've
talked about the phi ratio.

00:04:12.440 --> 00:04:14.530 align:middle line:90%
It's a mystical, magical number.

00:04:14.530 --> 00:04:18.490 align:middle line:10%
It's the number that governs
the proportions of our body,

00:04:18.490 --> 00:04:21.459 align:middle line:10%
the ratio of our
shoulders to our elbow

00:04:21.459 --> 00:04:25.090 align:middle line:10%
and our elbow to our wrist,
the ratio of the tip of one

00:04:25.090 --> 00:04:28.240 align:middle line:10%
finger to the first joint, and
then the ratio of that distance

00:04:28.240 --> 00:04:30.880 align:middle line:10%
to the next joint and
to the next joint,

00:04:30.880 --> 00:04:34.930 align:middle line:10%
the ratio of where our eyes
are located on our face,

00:04:34.930 --> 00:04:36.670 align:middle line:10%
and the distance
between our nose

00:04:36.670 --> 00:04:39.940 align:middle line:10%
and our lip in proportion
to the rest of our head.

00:04:39.940 --> 00:04:44.187 align:middle line:84%
We see this unfolding
beautifully as the spirals

00:04:44.187 --> 00:04:46.270 align:middle line:84%
that we see, and the
nautilus shells, for example,

00:04:46.270 --> 00:04:48.110 align:middle line:90%
are the classic example.

00:04:48.110 --> 00:04:51.550 align:middle line:84%
So this mystical phi
ratio applies to so much

00:04:51.550 --> 00:04:52.480 align:middle line:90%
of the natural world.

00:04:52.480 --> 00:04:56.840 align:middle line:84%
I'm not surprised that it would
apply, also, to cycles of time.

00:04:56.840 --> 00:04:58.810 align:middle line:84%
So in the last
episode, we used this

00:04:58.810 --> 00:05:03.100 align:middle line:84%
to help us calculate, in an
algorithm that you did not see,

00:05:03.100 --> 00:05:06.700 align:middle line:84%
the cycles from one
world event to the next

00:05:06.700 --> 00:05:09.340 align:middle line:84%
within the overall
cycle of time--

00:05:09.340 --> 00:05:11.890 align:middle line:90%
5,125 years.

00:05:11.890 --> 00:05:15.100 align:middle line:84%
In this algorithm, we
don't need that big cycle.

00:05:15.100 --> 00:05:17.590 align:middle line:84%
We're talking about what
has happened in your life

00:05:17.590 --> 00:05:20.120 align:middle line:84%
from one point to
the next to the next?

00:05:20.120 --> 00:05:25.360 align:middle line:84%
So in this example,
that number is 0.618.

00:05:25.360 --> 00:05:27.130 align:middle line:90%
This is the phi ratio--

00:05:27.130 --> 00:05:29.890 align:middle line:84%
mathematic representation
of the phi ratio.

00:05:29.890 --> 00:05:33.700 align:middle line:84%
And you would multiply that
times your seed event age.

00:05:33.700 --> 00:05:36.800 align:middle line:84%
My seed event age
was 11 years of age,

00:05:36.800 --> 00:05:43.930 align:middle line:84%
so when we multiply 0.618 times
11, we get the number 6.798.

00:05:43.930 --> 00:05:50.680 align:middle line:84%
So my variable of the
interval I sub phi,

00:05:50.680 --> 00:05:55.060 align:middle line:84%
as you're seeing on
the screen, is 6.798.

00:05:55.060 --> 00:05:57.130 align:middle line:90%
Third step-- very simple.

00:05:57.130 --> 00:05:59.860 align:middle line:90%
We add this phi ratio interval--

00:05:59.860 --> 00:06:06.580 align:middle line:84%
6.798-- to the seed event age at
the time of the emotional event

00:06:06.580 --> 00:06:11.440 align:middle line:84%
to determine when you can expect
the conditions for that seed

00:06:11.440 --> 00:06:14.030 align:middle line:84%
event to repeat
again in your life.

00:06:14.030 --> 00:06:16.690 align:middle line:84%
And once again, doesn't
mean the event will occur.

00:06:16.690 --> 00:06:19.300 align:middle line:84%
It means that's when
we can reasonably

00:06:19.300 --> 00:06:24.410 align:middle line:84%
expect the conditions that
precipitate the event to occur.

00:06:24.410 --> 00:06:26.930 align:middle line:84%
And when you do this,
you will get an age.

00:06:26.930 --> 00:06:31.000 align:middle line:84%
Now, if that age is
not your current age,

00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:33.550 align:middle line:84%
that age will be an
age in your past,

00:06:33.550 --> 00:06:36.190 align:middle line:84%
and then you can look at
the events of your life

00:06:36.190 --> 00:06:37.990 align:middle line:84%
during the time that
you were that age,

00:06:37.990 --> 00:06:41.080 align:middle line:84%
and you can see how those
events apply to the age.

00:06:41.080 --> 00:06:44.650 align:middle line:84%
If you want to bring
this cycle current,

00:06:44.650 --> 00:06:47.260 align:middle line:84%
the age that you have
just calculated now

00:06:47.260 --> 00:06:49.450 align:middle line:90%
becomes the new input.

00:06:49.450 --> 00:06:52.300 align:middle line:84%
It becomes the new seed
for the calculation.

00:06:52.300 --> 00:06:54.160 align:middle line:90%
And we'll do this together.

00:06:54.160 --> 00:06:57.220 align:middle line:84%
I'm just walking you
through where this is going.

00:06:57.220 --> 00:06:58.870 align:middle line:84%
It will become the
new seed, and we'll

00:06:58.870 --> 00:07:01.190 align:middle line:84%
go through the
calculation again.

00:07:01.190 --> 00:07:05.290 align:middle line:84%
So in my example, the
first calculation results

00:07:05.290 --> 00:07:10.840 align:middle line:84%
in an age of 6.798 plus
the age of 11, and that

00:07:10.840 --> 00:07:15.110 align:middle line:90%
gives me the age of 17.798.

00:07:15.110 --> 00:07:17.320 align:middle line:84%
Now, interestingly,
this is precisely

00:07:17.320 --> 00:07:21.340 align:middle line:84%
the age when I lost two
very powerfully significant

00:07:21.340 --> 00:07:23.570 align:middle line:90%
relationships in my life.

00:07:23.570 --> 00:07:26.830 align:middle line:84%
One was the very first
romance that I ever had--

00:07:26.830 --> 00:07:30.550 align:middle line:84%
and you know, when you're young,
those romances are important.

00:07:30.550 --> 00:07:37.360 align:middle line:84%
I embarked upon a path
when I lost my family.

00:07:37.360 --> 00:07:42.580 align:middle line:84%
I tried, as a child, to
recreate family on my own

00:07:42.580 --> 00:07:47.380 align:middle line:84%
without having the greater
family of my parents.

00:07:47.380 --> 00:07:51.460 align:middle line:84%
So I began creating
romantic relationships,

00:07:51.460 --> 00:07:56.170 align:middle line:84%
I began creating family of
my own at the age of 11.

00:07:56.170 --> 00:07:58.850 align:middle line:84%
And my relationships were
typically long-lasting.

00:07:58.850 --> 00:08:03.120 align:middle line:84%
So the first romance I had at
11, I lost at the age of 17.

00:08:03.120 --> 00:08:06.370 align:middle line:84%
And for me, at that time, that
was a long period of time.

00:08:06.370 --> 00:08:10.600 align:middle line:84%
That was very difficult. And
I also lost a dear friend

00:08:10.600 --> 00:08:11.800 align:middle line:90%
at the same time.

00:08:11.800 --> 00:08:13.270 align:middle line:90%
I didn't lose him in life.

00:08:13.270 --> 00:08:15.790 align:middle line:90%
I lost him as a friend.

00:08:15.790 --> 00:08:18.070 align:middle line:84%
As different as these
relationships were from one

00:08:18.070 --> 00:08:20.170 align:middle line:84%
another-- a friendship
and a romance--

00:08:20.170 --> 00:08:22.180 align:middle line:84%
the common denominator
to both, as I

00:08:22.180 --> 00:08:24.310 align:middle line:90%
was able to later recognize--

00:08:24.310 --> 00:08:27.550 align:middle line:84%
that in both instances,
it was loss--

00:08:27.550 --> 00:08:29.010 align:middle line:90%
because I lost them both--

00:08:29.010 --> 00:08:31.240 align:middle line:84%
but I lost them
both to betrayal.

00:08:31.240 --> 00:08:34.090 align:middle line:90%
Both of them betrayed my trust.

00:08:34.090 --> 00:08:36.520 align:middle line:84%
Both of them betrayed
my confidence.

00:08:36.520 --> 00:08:40.030 align:middle line:84%
And it was the betrayal
that was planted as the seed

00:08:40.030 --> 00:08:44.160 align:middle line:84%
that I felt when my father
left, that sense of loss

00:08:44.160 --> 00:08:44.960 align:middle line:90%
and betrayal.

00:08:44.960 --> 00:08:47.140 align:middle line:84%
And I'm giving you this as an
example of how it played out

00:08:47.140 --> 00:08:47.940 align:middle line:90%
in my life.

00:08:47.940 --> 00:08:50.192 align:middle line:90%


00:08:50.192 --> 00:08:51.650 align:middle line:84%
So what I've just
shared with you--

00:08:51.650 --> 00:08:55.130 align:middle line:84%
this was the first repeat
of the fractal cycle

00:08:55.130 --> 00:08:58.280 align:middle line:84%
after the original seed
event at the age of 11.

00:08:58.280 --> 00:09:01.160 align:middle line:84%
When I plug this date
back into the calculator,

00:09:01.160 --> 00:09:08.195 align:middle line:84%
the next age that comes up as
a cycle was the age of 24.596.

00:09:08.195 --> 00:09:10.580 align:middle line:84%
Well, interestingly,
this is precisely

00:09:10.580 --> 00:09:14.630 align:middle line:84%
the age when, again, loss and
betrayal played a powerful role

00:09:14.630 --> 00:09:15.860 align:middle line:90%
in my life.

00:09:15.860 --> 00:09:19.730 align:middle line:84%
In this instance, it was an
academic betrayal, as well as

00:09:19.730 --> 00:09:22.790 align:middle line:84%
the loss of a
significant relationship.

00:09:22.790 --> 00:09:26.600 align:middle line:84%
The academic betrayal was
completely unexpected.

00:09:26.600 --> 00:09:30.770 align:middle line:10%
I was studying as an
undergraduate in a geology

00:09:30.770 --> 00:09:34.070 align:middle line:10%
program, had a
full-credit 19 credits,

00:09:34.070 --> 00:09:35.870 align:middle line:10%
and I was also
working three jobs

00:09:35.870 --> 00:09:37.910 align:middle line:10%
to pay for the out-of-state
tuition that was

00:09:37.910 --> 00:09:41.810 align:middle line:10%
allowing me to take this major.

00:09:41.810 --> 00:09:45.830 align:middle line:84%
And while I was doing so,
my GPA dropped briefly

00:09:45.830 --> 00:09:49.880 align:middle line:84%
below the level that was
expected at the time,

00:09:49.880 --> 00:09:53.180 align:middle line:84%
and the university felt that
I was not a good candidate

00:09:53.180 --> 00:09:56.115 align:middle line:84%
to continue in a
geology program.

00:09:56.115 --> 00:09:57.740 align:middle line:10%
Now, where this gets
really interesting

00:09:57.740 --> 00:09:59.570 align:middle line:10%
is I end up leaving
the university

00:09:59.570 --> 00:10:02.660 align:middle line:10%
and working as a geologist
during the first energy

00:10:02.660 --> 00:10:07.430 align:middle line:10%
crisis of the 1970s
and using my job

00:10:07.430 --> 00:10:11.120 align:middle line:10%
to have academic credits
to complete my degree.

00:10:11.120 --> 00:10:14.690 align:middle line:84%
So I was actually
paid for working

00:10:14.690 --> 00:10:16.640 align:middle line:90%
as a geologist at that time.

00:10:16.640 --> 00:10:19.190 align:middle line:84%
I was working as a
computer geologist--

00:10:19.190 --> 00:10:22.970 align:middle line:84%
subsurface mapping during the
energy crisis of the '70s.

00:10:22.970 --> 00:10:24.890 align:middle line:84%
And the work that
I was doing counted

00:10:24.890 --> 00:10:28.950 align:middle line:84%
towards college credits, and I
finished my degree in that way.

00:10:28.950 --> 00:10:30.680 align:middle line:84%
But the university
that I had trusted,

00:10:30.680 --> 00:10:34.310 align:middle line:84%
that I'd put so much trust
and faith into, simply

00:10:34.310 --> 00:10:35.930 align:middle line:84%
looked at one parameter
and they said,

00:10:35.930 --> 00:10:37.764 align:middle line:84%
this is what's
happening in your life.

00:10:37.764 --> 00:10:38.930 align:middle line:90%
You're not a good candidate.

00:10:38.930 --> 00:10:42.740 align:middle line:84%
And I interpreted that
as a tremendous betrayal

00:10:42.740 --> 00:10:45.110 align:middle line:84%
of an institution that
I had a lot of faith

00:10:45.110 --> 00:10:47.810 align:middle line:84%
in, that I trusted, and that
I'd put a lot of time and energy

00:10:47.810 --> 00:10:48.980 align:middle line:90%
into.

00:10:48.980 --> 00:10:53.270 align:middle line:84%
Not surprisingly, once again, I
lost an intimate relationship--

00:10:53.270 --> 00:10:55.260 align:middle line:90%
a romance-- at the same time.

00:10:55.260 --> 00:10:57.710 align:middle line:90%
Once again, both as loss--

00:10:57.710 --> 00:11:02.280 align:middle line:84%
I was losing both-- and
once again as betrayal.

00:11:02.280 --> 00:11:06.420 align:middle line:84%
The next fractal cycle
that played out in my life

00:11:06.420 --> 00:11:11.940 align:middle line:84%
as loss and betrayal was at
the age of 38 years 0.192--

00:11:11.940 --> 00:11:14.535 align:middle line:90%
38.192 years.

00:11:14.535 --> 00:11:16.860 align:middle line:84%
And this was a really
interesting time for me,

00:11:16.860 --> 00:11:21.450 align:middle line:84%
because it was the
loss of both a business

00:11:21.450 --> 00:11:24.450 align:middle line:84%
and a financial betrayal,
as well as the loss

00:11:24.450 --> 00:11:26.530 align:middle line:90%
of a significant relationship.

00:11:26.530 --> 00:11:29.490 align:middle line:84%
And I actually talked about
this in a previous episode

00:11:29.490 --> 00:11:31.320 align:middle line:90%
of this series.

00:11:31.320 --> 00:11:34.260 align:middle line:84%
I mentioned that three
people came into my life

00:11:34.260 --> 00:11:35.130 align:middle line:90%
all at one time.

00:11:35.130 --> 00:11:37.770 align:middle line:84%
We're talking about the
mirrors of relationship.

00:11:37.770 --> 00:11:40.980 align:middle line:84%
One of those people had
access to my finances.

00:11:40.980 --> 00:11:42.720 align:middle line:84%
The other one was
a business partner,

00:11:42.720 --> 00:11:44.850 align:middle line:84%
and then the third
was a friendship.

00:11:44.850 --> 00:11:48.240 align:middle line:90%
So it was these relationships--

00:11:48.240 --> 00:11:53.430 align:middle line:84%
the person that had access to
my finances took those finances,

00:11:53.430 --> 00:11:57.840 align:middle line:84%
and I had no way to continue
my business and life.

00:11:57.840 --> 00:12:00.580 align:middle line:84%
And that was what forced me
to stop and look and say, wow,

00:12:00.580 --> 00:12:01.380 align:middle line:90%
what's going on?

00:12:01.380 --> 00:12:03.240 align:middle line:84%
What is the pattern
that's playing here?

00:12:03.240 --> 00:12:06.124 align:middle line:84%
And that led me to the
understanding of the mirror

00:12:06.124 --> 00:12:08.040 align:middle line:84%
that we talked about--
the mirror of judgment,

00:12:08.040 --> 00:12:09.440 align:middle line:90%
mirror number 2--

00:12:09.440 --> 00:12:11.400 align:middle line:90%
in the earlier episode.

00:12:11.400 --> 00:12:14.670 align:middle line:84%
But the business relationship
was also about betrayal.

00:12:14.670 --> 00:12:17.980 align:middle line:84%
Here was a man that I had
trusted with my livelihood.

00:12:17.980 --> 00:12:21.810 align:middle line:84%
He had toured me, for six
weeks, all up and down the West

00:12:21.810 --> 00:12:24.824 align:middle line:84%
Coast of the United States,
from Washington state

00:12:24.824 --> 00:12:26.490 align:middle line:84%
all the way down to
Southern California.

00:12:26.490 --> 00:12:28.320 align:middle line:90%
And I'd done really good work.

00:12:28.320 --> 00:12:31.950 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I'd given it everything,
and I was doing presentations.

00:12:31.950 --> 00:12:33.940 align:middle line:90%
I was doing interviews.

00:12:33.940 --> 00:12:35.520 align:middle line:90%
I was doing keynotes.

00:12:35.520 --> 00:12:37.560 align:middle line:90%
I was doing weekend workshops--

00:12:37.560 --> 00:12:39.050 align:middle line:90%
for six weeks.

00:12:39.050 --> 00:12:41.670 align:middle line:84%
And at the end of the six
weeks, this is when he said,

00:12:41.670 --> 00:12:43.530 align:middle line:84%
we have the money to
cover the expenses.

00:12:43.530 --> 00:12:45.690 align:middle line:84%
We'd broken even, but
there's nothing left.

00:12:45.690 --> 00:12:47.700 align:middle line:84%
And I actually went
back to my home

00:12:47.700 --> 00:12:51.330 align:middle line:84%
with less money after the six
weeks than I had when I began.

00:12:51.330 --> 00:12:55.600 align:middle line:84%
No money to pay my bills, my
mortgage, insurance, nothing.

00:12:55.600 --> 00:12:58.350 align:middle line:84%
It was at this time that
the person that I trusted

00:12:58.350 --> 00:13:01.410 align:middle line:84%
in my personal life-- my
intimate relationship--

00:13:01.410 --> 00:13:03.960 align:middle line:84%
went and took whatever money
was there out of the bank.

00:13:03.960 --> 00:13:06.840 align:middle line:84%
So these give you some
details, and maybe

00:13:06.840 --> 00:13:09.720 align:middle line:84%
by sharing my experience,
you can see parallels.

00:13:09.720 --> 00:13:12.404 align:middle line:84%
I'm not saying exactly the
same thing has happened

00:13:12.404 --> 00:13:14.820 align:middle line:84%
in your life, but maybe you
can see parallels in your life

00:13:14.820 --> 00:13:17.220 align:middle line:84%
and begin to apply
how these things work.

00:13:17.220 --> 00:13:19.030 align:middle line:90%
The pattern was the same.

00:13:19.030 --> 00:13:20.560 align:middle line:90%
It was playing out again--

00:13:20.560 --> 00:13:23.800 align:middle line:84%
the pattern of
loss and betrayal.

00:13:23.800 --> 00:13:26.230 align:middle line:84%
The next time this pattern
showed up in my life

00:13:26.230 --> 00:13:27.654 align:middle line:90%
was the last time--

00:13:27.654 --> 00:13:30.070 align:middle line:84%
and that's the really good
news of being able to recognize

00:13:30.070 --> 00:13:31.600 align:middle line:90%
these patterns.

00:13:31.600 --> 00:13:38.690 align:middle line:84%
I was 44.99 years old when this
pattern repeated in my life.

00:13:38.690 --> 00:13:41.050 align:middle line:84%
So from the time that my
father left at the age of 11

00:13:41.050 --> 00:13:44.680 align:middle line:84%
until the age of 44, those,
essentially, three decades

00:13:44.680 --> 00:13:47.920 align:middle line:84%
is where the pattern repeated
again and again until I

00:13:47.920 --> 00:13:50.350 align:middle line:90%
had the wisdom to recognize it.

00:13:50.350 --> 00:13:54.820 align:middle line:84%
At the age of 44.99
years, there was again

00:13:54.820 --> 00:13:56.650 align:middle line:90%
a loss and a betrayal.

00:13:56.650 --> 00:13:58.870 align:middle line:84%
It was a business
betrayal, followed

00:13:58.870 --> 00:14:02.560 align:middle line:84%
by the healing of a friendship
and a healing of that business

00:14:02.560 --> 00:14:06.850 align:middle line:84%
relationship, and that is
what changed the pattern.

00:14:06.850 --> 00:14:10.270 align:middle line:84%
The loss occurred, but
I had changed the way

00:14:10.270 --> 00:14:12.190 align:middle line:90%
that I perceived the loss.

00:14:12.190 --> 00:14:14.800 align:middle line:84%
In the past, I had
simply cut the ties

00:14:14.800 --> 00:14:16.485 align:middle line:84%
with those relationships
and moved on,

00:14:16.485 --> 00:14:18.730 align:middle line:84%
and this time I did
something different.

00:14:18.730 --> 00:14:22.190 align:middle line:84%
This time, I went back, and
I talked to these people.

00:14:22.190 --> 00:14:23.860 align:middle line:84%
And I said, look,
we have a history.

00:14:23.860 --> 00:14:24.490 align:middle line:90%
We're friends.

00:14:24.490 --> 00:14:25.864 align:middle line:84%
We've been through
this together.

00:14:25.864 --> 00:14:27.040 align:middle line:90%
What's happening?

00:14:27.040 --> 00:14:31.300 align:middle line:84%
And it was the ability to
consciously communicate

00:14:31.300 --> 00:14:33.340 align:middle line:84%
in a way without
judgment-- and there's

00:14:33.340 --> 00:14:35.980 align:middle line:84%
a whole story, a whole
workshop about how

00:14:35.980 --> 00:14:37.390 align:middle line:90%
I arrived at that place.

00:14:37.390 --> 00:14:39.790 align:middle line:84%
Has to do with the
mirrors of relationship.

00:14:39.790 --> 00:14:43.300 align:middle line:84%
But it was my
ability to reconcile

00:14:43.300 --> 00:14:47.230 align:middle line:84%
what had happened
without the judgment that

00:14:47.230 --> 00:14:48.750 align:middle line:90%
freed me from the cycle.

00:14:48.750 --> 00:14:50.583 align:middle line:84%
Now, I just want to
talk to you a little bit

00:14:50.583 --> 00:14:53.350 align:middle line:84%
about how this works,
because it's fascinating.

00:14:53.350 --> 00:14:55.810 align:middle line:84%
I mentioned that the patterns
repeat again and again

00:14:55.810 --> 00:14:58.720 align:middle line:84%
until something
changes the patterns.

00:14:58.720 --> 00:15:01.220 align:middle line:84%
One of the things that allows
those patterns to repeat--

00:15:01.220 --> 00:15:03.250 align:middle line:84%
and I'm going to go
back to mirrors--

00:15:03.250 --> 00:15:06.114 align:middle line:84%
one of the things that allows
those mirrors to show up again

00:15:06.114 --> 00:15:08.530 align:middle line:84%
and again and again in our
lives-- the mirror of judgment,

00:15:08.530 --> 00:15:10.190 align:middle line:90%
for example--

00:15:10.190 --> 00:15:13.000 align:middle line:84%
it is the judgment
itself, the judgment

00:15:13.000 --> 00:15:16.210 align:middle line:90%
when we judge our experiences--

00:15:16.210 --> 00:15:19.530 align:middle line:90%
that judgment is like a magnet.

00:15:19.530 --> 00:15:23.120 align:middle line:84%
It is an energetic
magnet that promises

00:15:23.120 --> 00:15:26.690 align:middle line:84%
that the same experience will
come to you again and again

00:15:26.690 --> 00:15:30.050 align:middle line:84%
and again until you
demagnetize the experience,

00:15:30.050 --> 00:15:32.400 align:middle line:90%
until you release that judgment.

00:15:32.400 --> 00:15:35.600 align:middle line:84%
Once you do-- and
this is so powerful--

00:15:35.600 --> 00:15:39.230 align:middle line:84%
once you release the
judgment of one experience

00:15:39.230 --> 00:15:42.840 align:middle line:84%
and one relationship in
one place in your life,

00:15:42.840 --> 00:15:46.800 align:middle line:84%
there is what is called
the cascade effect.

00:15:46.800 --> 00:15:51.570 align:middle line:84%
The cascade effect is you will
see the ripples of that healing

00:15:51.570 --> 00:15:55.260 align:middle line:84%
permeate all the other
relationships in your life that

00:15:55.260 --> 00:15:57.340 align:middle line:84%
are based on that
same principle.

00:15:57.340 --> 00:15:59.740 align:middle line:84%
So the judgment in a
business relationship,

00:15:59.740 --> 00:16:02.910 align:middle line:84%
for example, once it's
healed, or the judgment

00:16:02.910 --> 00:16:06.700 align:middle line:84%
in an intimate relationship
with a partner or a spouse

00:16:06.700 --> 00:16:07.500 align:middle line:90%
or with a sibling--

00:16:07.500 --> 00:16:13.350 align:middle line:84%
once that's healed, that healing
ripples throughout your work,

00:16:13.350 --> 00:16:16.320 align:middle line:84%
throughout your friendships,
throughout your business

00:16:16.320 --> 00:16:18.780 align:middle line:84%
relationships, throughout
every relationship

00:16:18.780 --> 00:16:20.970 align:middle line:84%
you have without going
to each relationship

00:16:20.970 --> 00:16:23.024 align:middle line:84%
individually and saying,
OK, this one's healed.

00:16:23.024 --> 00:16:23.940 align:middle line:90%
OK, this one's healed.

00:16:23.940 --> 00:16:25.140 align:middle line:90%
This one's healed.

00:16:25.140 --> 00:16:27.510 align:middle line:84%
This is the value of
understanding these patterns

00:16:27.510 --> 00:16:28.680 align:middle line:90%
in our lives.

00:16:28.680 --> 00:16:33.660 align:middle line:84%
So at the age of
44.99 years, I healed

00:16:33.660 --> 00:16:36.510 align:middle line:84%
the judgment of
loss and betrayal

00:16:36.510 --> 00:16:38.530 align:middle line:84%
and what it had
meant in my life.

00:16:38.530 --> 00:16:41.130 align:middle line:84%
And the moment that I did
that, that pattern shifted.

00:16:41.130 --> 00:16:45.360 align:middle line:84%
I had created a seed
for a new cycle,

00:16:45.360 --> 00:16:50.310 align:middle line:84%
and the seed is what sets into
motion a pattern of energy that

00:16:50.310 --> 00:16:52.740 align:middle line:84%
will repeat on a rhythmic
basis until something

00:16:52.740 --> 00:16:53.914 align:middle line:90%
changes the pattern.

00:16:53.914 --> 00:16:55.830 align:middle line:84%
Or maybe you don't want
to change the pattern.

00:16:55.830 --> 00:16:58.500 align:middle line:84%
If you have changed the
pattern in a healthy way

00:16:58.500 --> 00:17:01.712 align:middle line:84%
to abundance and
success and trust,

00:17:01.712 --> 00:17:04.170 align:middle line:84%
then there's every reason to
believe that that pattern will

00:17:04.170 --> 00:17:08.160 align:middle line:84%
continue in your life again and
again and again until something

00:17:08.160 --> 00:17:10.776 align:middle line:84%
changes, and if you don't
want to change that pattern,

00:17:10.776 --> 00:17:11.859 align:middle line:90%
it doesn't have to change.

00:17:11.859 --> 00:17:14.700 align:middle line:84%
I want to give you some
examples of really good things

00:17:14.700 --> 00:17:17.160 align:middle line:84%
that can happen from
these kinds of changes

00:17:17.160 --> 00:17:20.280 align:middle line:84%
as well, because the
fractal cycles work

00:17:20.280 --> 00:17:23.700 align:middle line:84%
for good and beautiful
and powerful and positive

00:17:23.700 --> 00:17:28.079 align:middle line:84%
changes, as well as the deeply
significant emotional changes

00:17:28.079 --> 00:17:31.600 align:middle line:90%
of loss and betrayal.

00:17:31.600 --> 00:17:35.950 align:middle line:84%
After my father left our family,
my mother, my younger brother,

00:17:35.950 --> 00:17:37.690 align:middle line:84%
and I-- he's four
years younger--

00:17:37.690 --> 00:17:40.450 align:middle line:84%
we were left to be
a family on our own.

00:17:40.450 --> 00:17:43.590 align:middle line:84%
It was completely unexpected--
at least to my mother.

00:17:43.590 --> 00:17:45.640 align:middle line:84%
And I'll just tell you,
as I mentioned earlier,

00:17:45.640 --> 00:17:50.990 align:middle line:84%
it was an abusive, alcoholic,
very dysfunctional family.

00:17:50.990 --> 00:17:54.040 align:middle line:84%
So for me, even though it
was about loss and betrayal,

00:17:54.040 --> 00:17:56.170 align:middle line:84%
I was not that
unhappy when my father

00:17:56.170 --> 00:17:59.410 align:middle line:84%
left, because we had relief
in the family on the one hand.

00:17:59.410 --> 00:18:02.240 align:middle line:84%
And on the other hand,
things changed for me.

00:18:02.240 --> 00:18:04.960 align:middle line:90%
And this was back in the 1960s.

00:18:04.960 --> 00:18:07.310 align:middle line:90%
We had no money.

00:18:07.310 --> 00:18:09.994 align:middle line:84%
My mother had been a
homemaker and a parent.

00:18:09.994 --> 00:18:11.410 align:middle line:84%
She had not been
in the workplace.

00:18:11.410 --> 00:18:14.110 align:middle line:84%
And she found herself going
back into the workplace

00:18:14.110 --> 00:18:16.030 align:middle line:84%
and found how difficult
it was to make

00:18:16.030 --> 00:18:19.150 align:middle line:84%
enough money to cover the
expenses for a household

00:18:19.150 --> 00:18:21.610 align:middle line:90%
and two young boys.

00:18:21.610 --> 00:18:25.780 align:middle line:84%
And I went to work at an early
age to help contribute to that.

00:18:25.780 --> 00:18:27.640 align:middle line:84%
Now, what I'm
going to say next--

00:18:27.640 --> 00:18:31.464 align:middle line:84%
I'm not necessarily
bragging about it,

00:18:31.464 --> 00:18:33.130 align:middle line:84%
and I'm not recommending
that you do it.

00:18:33.130 --> 00:18:37.070 align:middle line:84%
I lied about my age, and I
went to work at an early age.

00:18:37.070 --> 00:18:40.690 align:middle line:90%
I was 16, 17 years old.

00:18:40.690 --> 00:18:44.260 align:middle line:84%
When I went to work, I
began working in factories,

00:18:44.260 --> 00:18:49.530 align:middle line:84%
because the money was really
good in the factories.

00:18:49.530 --> 00:18:53.400 align:middle line:84%
So I had my first corporate
paycheck at the age of 16,

00:18:53.400 --> 00:18:56.130 align:middle line:84%
and I have to tell you, I
remember it to this day,

00:18:56.130 --> 00:18:57.480 align:middle line:90%
in my 60s.

00:18:57.480 --> 00:18:59.340 align:middle line:84%
I remember it as if
it was yesterday.

00:18:59.340 --> 00:19:04.560 align:middle line:84%
I was standing in line in front
of an old-fashioned time clock.

00:19:04.560 --> 00:19:07.470 align:middle line:84%
We used to punch in and
punch out your time card.

00:19:07.470 --> 00:19:09.120 align:middle line:84%
And I was with a
row of all men that

00:19:09.120 --> 00:19:10.560 align:middle line:90%
were working in a copper mill.

00:19:10.560 --> 00:19:13.480 align:middle line:84%
It was a copper factory
in northern Missouri.

00:19:13.480 --> 00:19:17.070 align:middle line:84%
Very difficult conditions, our
shift-- we were union shift.

00:19:17.070 --> 00:19:20.160 align:middle line:84%
It was from 4:00 o'clock in
the afternoon until midnight,

00:19:20.160 --> 00:19:22.350 align:middle line:84%
and if we worked overtime,
it was until 4:00 AM

00:19:22.350 --> 00:19:24.585 align:middle line:84%
in the morning-- so 12:00
to 12:00, or 4:00 to 4:00--

00:19:24.585 --> 00:19:26.370 align:middle line:90%
12-hour shifts.

00:19:26.370 --> 00:19:28.230 align:middle line:90%
I remember the very first time--

00:19:28.230 --> 00:19:29.880 align:middle line:90%
the very first time--

00:19:29.880 --> 00:19:33.660 align:middle line:84%
that our supervisor handed
me a physical paycheck.

00:19:33.660 --> 00:19:35.910 align:middle line:84%
And he looked at me, and
what he said to me-- he said,

00:19:35.910 --> 00:19:39.480 align:middle line:84%
this is a man's wage
for a man's work.

00:19:39.480 --> 00:19:42.300 align:middle line:90%
A man's wage for a man's work.

00:19:42.300 --> 00:19:45.750 align:middle line:84%
And it gave me the freedom
to contribute to my family,

00:19:45.750 --> 00:19:50.310 align:middle line:84%
and it set into motion
a powerful seed for me.

00:19:50.310 --> 00:19:53.010 align:middle line:84%
And that seed has continued
with me throughout my life.

00:19:53.010 --> 00:19:56.580 align:middle line:10%
It was the seed of
abundance and success,

00:19:56.580 --> 00:20:01.590 align:middle line:10%
because I understood
that by my work,

00:20:01.590 --> 00:20:03.947 align:middle line:10%
something good could
come from that.

00:20:03.947 --> 00:20:05.780 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to share
something else with you--

00:20:05.780 --> 00:20:08.040 align:middle line:90%
and this is very personal.

00:20:08.040 --> 00:20:11.130 align:middle line:84%
At the age of 11, when
the family broke up,

00:20:11.130 --> 00:20:13.000 align:middle line:90%
my mom gave me a book.

00:20:13.000 --> 00:20:15.489 align:middle line:84%
And she said, I think
this book will help you

00:20:15.489 --> 00:20:16.530 align:middle line:90%
through a difficult time.

00:20:16.530 --> 00:20:18.570 align:middle line:84%
Many of you, I know,
know this book.

00:20:18.570 --> 00:20:20.880 align:middle line:10%
It was a book that was
called "The Prophet,"

00:20:20.880 --> 00:20:24.210 align:middle line:10%
and it was written by a
man called Kahlil Gibran.

00:20:24.210 --> 00:20:25.440 align:middle line:10%
Very, very powerful book.

00:20:25.440 --> 00:20:28.560 align:middle line:10%
Each chapter was just
a couple of paragraphs,

00:20:28.560 --> 00:20:32.580 align:middle line:10%
or maybe a couple of pages,
but they spoke volumes to me.

00:20:32.580 --> 00:20:35.250 align:middle line:84%
And I remember there
was a chapter on work,

00:20:35.250 --> 00:20:36.840 align:middle line:90%
and Kahlil Gibran--

00:20:36.840 --> 00:20:39.720 align:middle line:84%
he ended that chapter
by simply stating,

00:20:39.720 --> 00:20:42.990 align:middle line:90%
"Work is love made visible."

00:20:42.990 --> 00:20:45.930 align:middle line:90%
"Work is love made visible."

00:20:45.930 --> 00:20:49.620 align:middle line:84%
That meant something to me, and
that became my anchor in life.

00:20:49.620 --> 00:20:51.300 align:middle line:84%
And every job that
I took, whether I

00:20:51.300 --> 00:20:55.290 align:middle line:84%
was loading box cars with
cat litter in 50-pound bags

00:20:55.290 --> 00:20:57.765 align:middle line:84%
or working in a copper mill
or working in a fabric mill

00:20:57.765 --> 00:21:00.630 align:middle line:84%
or working in a restaurant-- no
matter what it was, for me, it

00:21:00.630 --> 00:21:02.280 align:middle line:90%
wasn't about the work.

00:21:02.280 --> 00:21:04.450 align:middle line:84%
It was about my
love made visible--

00:21:04.450 --> 00:21:07.380 align:middle line:84%
how good of a job could I do
no matter what I was doing?

00:21:07.380 --> 00:21:10.290 align:middle line:84%
And that thinking--
that thinking

00:21:10.290 --> 00:21:13.560 align:middle line:84%
is part of what this
seed was all about.

00:21:13.560 --> 00:21:16.680 align:middle line:84%
It's why that paycheck
at 16 was so important.

00:21:16.680 --> 00:21:19.230 align:middle line:84%
So I just want to share
with you, at 16 years old,

00:21:19.230 --> 00:21:22.280 align:middle line:84%
I planted the seed for
abundance and success,

00:21:22.280 --> 00:21:25.190 align:middle line:90%
and that seed continued.

00:21:25.190 --> 00:21:30.980 align:middle line:84%
At the age of 25.88 years, I
had my first corporate position.

00:21:30.980 --> 00:21:33.865 align:middle line:84%
I was hired to work in the
corporations as a geologist--

00:21:33.865 --> 00:21:36.290 align:middle line:84%
and I've shared
that story with you

00:21:36.290 --> 00:21:38.510 align:middle line:84%
from what happened
in the universities.

00:21:38.510 --> 00:21:41.990 align:middle line:84%
The next fractal--
and that 25.88,

00:21:41.990 --> 00:21:44.240 align:middle line:84%
that's exactly on
the fractal cycle.

00:21:44.240 --> 00:21:47.030 align:middle line:84%
The next fractal cycle-- using
the time code calculator--

00:21:47.030 --> 00:21:52.620 align:middle line:84%
the next age was
exactly 35.7 years.

00:21:52.620 --> 00:21:56.380 align:middle line:84%
35.7 years is a very
significant year for me.

00:21:56.380 --> 00:21:57.930 align:middle line:84%
I was working in
the corporations

00:21:57.930 --> 00:22:00.240 align:middle line:90%
during the Cold War.

00:22:00.240 --> 00:22:05.550 align:middle line:84%
I was a software designer, and
I received an award for the job

00:22:05.550 --> 00:22:08.220 align:middle line:84%
that myself and my
department had accomplished

00:22:08.220 --> 00:22:10.620 align:middle line:84%
during that time,
and the invitation

00:22:10.620 --> 00:22:13.410 align:middle line:84%
to continue with
another project.

00:22:13.410 --> 00:22:15.030 align:middle line:84%
And I knew that I
would not be there

00:22:15.030 --> 00:22:16.740 align:middle line:90%
to see that project through.

00:22:16.740 --> 00:22:19.290 align:middle line:84%
That was the year I
left the corporations

00:22:19.290 --> 00:22:22.260 align:middle line:84%
and began writing full
time and exploring

00:22:22.260 --> 00:22:24.510 align:middle line:84%
the principles that you and
I are talking about today.

00:22:24.510 --> 00:22:25.940 align:middle line:90%
That's exactly when it happened.

00:22:25.940 --> 00:22:28.990 align:middle line:90%


00:22:28.990 --> 00:22:33.030 align:middle line:84%
My next fractal cycle
was the age of 45.6. .

00:22:33.030 --> 00:22:38.860 align:middle line:84%
At 45.6, the fruits of my labor
from leaving the corporations

00:22:38.860 --> 00:22:42.625 align:middle line:84%
unfolded as my first
corporate publishing offer.

00:22:42.625 --> 00:22:45.160 align:middle line:10%
It was at that time
Random House offered me

00:22:45.160 --> 00:22:46.810 align:middle line:10%
a publishing contract.

00:22:46.810 --> 00:22:48.910 align:middle line:10%
I had self-published two books.

00:22:48.910 --> 00:22:50.770 align:middle line:84%
They were successful
enough for Random House

00:22:50.770 --> 00:22:54.290 align:middle line:84%
to come and invite me to
write a third book with them.

00:22:54.290 --> 00:22:56.180 align:middle line:84%
As they say, the
rest is history.

00:22:56.180 --> 00:22:58.900 align:middle line:84%
So I'm giving you examples--
all these things I just shared,

00:22:58.900 --> 00:23:01.660 align:middle line:84%
you can see them on the
time code calculator.

00:23:01.660 --> 00:23:05.680 align:middle line:84%
When I planted that seed
of abundance and success

00:23:05.680 --> 00:23:10.360 align:middle line:84%
at the age of 16, I set into
motion a pattern of energy,

00:23:10.360 --> 00:23:12.310 align:middle line:84%
and that pattern
is a pattern that

00:23:12.310 --> 00:23:15.610 align:middle line:84%
has stayed with me on another
level-- beyond the hurt,

00:23:15.610 --> 00:23:17.620 align:middle line:84%
beyond the loss,
beyond the betrayal--

00:23:17.620 --> 00:23:20.120 align:middle line:84%
because these patterns play
out this way in our lives.

00:23:20.120 --> 00:23:22.960 align:middle line:84%
They play out again
and again and again.

00:23:22.960 --> 00:23:27.130 align:middle line:84%
Now, I want to mention something
about these personal patterns

00:23:27.130 --> 00:23:29.170 align:middle line:84%
that also applies to
the global patterns

00:23:29.170 --> 00:23:31.690 align:middle line:84%
that we talked about
earlier, because nature

00:23:31.690 --> 00:23:33.650 align:middle line:90%
doesn't turn on a dime.

00:23:33.650 --> 00:23:36.310 align:middle line:84%
Now, I had a supervisor
once, and he said,

00:23:36.310 --> 00:23:39.880 align:middle line:84%
change in the world
is kind of like change

00:23:39.880 --> 00:23:41.380 align:middle line:90%
on a big ship on the ocean.

00:23:41.380 --> 00:23:44.980 align:middle line:84%
He'd been a Navy captain
during the Vietnam War.

00:23:44.980 --> 00:23:46.481 align:middle line:84%
And he said, when
a battleship wants

00:23:46.481 --> 00:23:48.188 align:middle line:84%
to turn around and go
back the other way,

00:23:48.188 --> 00:23:49.450 align:middle line:90%
it doesn't turn on a dime.

00:23:49.450 --> 00:23:53.350 align:middle line:84%
It makes a big, long,
slow turn to begin

00:23:53.350 --> 00:23:55.180 align:middle line:90%
going back the other way.

00:23:55.180 --> 00:23:57.260 align:middle line:84%
Our cycles tend to
work this way as well.

00:23:57.260 --> 00:23:59.860 align:middle line:84%
They don't end at
midnight on a specific day

00:23:59.860 --> 00:24:01.960 align:middle line:84%
just because the
cycle says it ends.

00:24:01.960 --> 00:24:03.650 align:middle line:84%
What's really
interesting-- and again,

00:24:03.650 --> 00:24:06.340 align:middle line:84%
this applies to your personal
cycles as well as global

00:24:06.340 --> 00:24:07.600 align:middle line:90%
cycles--

00:24:07.600 --> 00:24:10.390 align:middle line:90%
is that there is a buffer--

00:24:10.390 --> 00:24:12.400 align:middle line:84%
that I mentioned in
the last episode.

00:24:12.400 --> 00:24:15.370 align:middle line:84%
What I did not mention then--
and I'd like to share with you

00:24:15.370 --> 00:24:16.330 align:middle line:90%
now--

00:24:16.330 --> 00:24:20.560 align:middle line:84%
is how to calculate that
buffer, what it's determined by.

00:24:20.560 --> 00:24:23.990 align:middle line:84%
The buffer between when
one cycle ends and the next

00:24:23.990 --> 00:24:24.790 align:middle line:90%
begins--

00:24:24.790 --> 00:24:26.850 align:middle line:90%
where that choice point lies--

00:24:26.850 --> 00:24:35.190 align:middle line:84%
it is determined by a factor of
how long the original cycle is.

00:24:35.190 --> 00:24:39.840 align:middle line:84%
And I want to give you the
number for that factor.

00:24:39.840 --> 00:24:43.280 align:middle line:84%
So the factor that is
applied to the length

00:24:43.280 --> 00:24:45.830 align:middle line:84%
of the previous
cycle is a fraction.

00:24:45.830 --> 00:24:51.080 align:middle line:90%
It is 0.0070243.

00:24:51.080 --> 00:24:52.910 align:middle line:90%
I'm going to say this again.

00:24:52.910 --> 00:24:57.260 align:middle line:90%
0.0070243.

00:24:57.260 --> 00:25:02.900 align:middle line:10%
If you apply that fraction to
the length of the cycle you've

00:25:02.900 --> 00:25:05.300 align:middle line:10%
calculated in
years, it will tell

00:25:05.300 --> 00:25:10.040 align:middle line:10%
you approximately how long
the buffer for that cycle

00:25:10.040 --> 00:25:13.520 align:middle line:10%
is, and the conditions
for the previous cycle--

00:25:13.520 --> 00:25:14.930 align:middle line:10%
as well as for the new ones--

00:25:14.930 --> 00:25:17.580 align:middle line:10%
are both happening during
that period of time.

00:25:17.580 --> 00:25:19.190 align:middle line:90%
This is your choice point.

00:25:19.190 --> 00:25:21.970 align:middle line:84%
This is when your choices
become most potent.

00:25:21.970 --> 00:25:24.000 align:middle line:84%
And once again, you
can choose at any time.

00:25:24.000 --> 00:25:26.530 align:middle line:84%
We have free will to
choose at any time.

00:25:26.530 --> 00:25:29.390 align:middle line:84%
But if you want to stack
the deck in your favor

00:25:29.390 --> 00:25:32.720 align:middle line:84%
within the rules of
nature's rhythms and cycles,

00:25:32.720 --> 00:25:37.439 align:middle line:84%
the choice point is the
place to do just that.

00:25:37.439 --> 00:25:38.980 align:middle line:84%
So the value of
everything we've just

00:25:38.980 --> 00:25:41.650 align:middle line:84%
done in this episode
for personal cycles--

00:25:41.650 --> 00:25:43.900 align:middle line:84%
and what I'm going to say
applies to the global cycles

00:25:43.900 --> 00:25:44.800 align:middle line:90%
as well--

00:25:44.800 --> 00:25:49.330 align:middle line:84%
is first to even recognize that
these cycles are playing out,

00:25:49.330 --> 00:25:52.900 align:middle line:84%
that things are not just
happening for no reason.

00:25:52.900 --> 00:25:55.120 align:middle line:84%
If there's a lot of
chaos in your life

00:25:55.120 --> 00:25:56.884 align:middle line:84%
or a lot of chaos
in the world, it's

00:25:56.884 --> 00:25:58.300 align:middle line:84%
not that your life
is coming apart

00:25:58.300 --> 00:26:00.930 align:middle line:84%
at the seams for no reason or
that the world is falling apart

00:26:00.930 --> 00:26:01.730 align:middle line:90%
for no reason.

00:26:01.730 --> 00:26:04.220 align:middle line:84%
We step back and look
at the big picture,

00:26:04.220 --> 00:26:07.000 align:middle line:84%
we're able to see that
all of the chaos that we

00:26:07.000 --> 00:26:12.640 align:middle line:84%
see up close actually falls
into patterns of beautiful order

00:26:12.640 --> 00:26:15.047 align:middle line:84%
that makes sense from
the larger scale.

00:26:15.047 --> 00:26:16.130 align:middle line:90%
So that's the first thing.

00:26:16.130 --> 00:26:19.430 align:middle line:90%


00:26:19.430 --> 00:26:22.000 align:middle line:84%
The second thing
is when we begin

00:26:22.000 --> 00:26:24.190 align:middle line:84%
to recognize the
patterns, we also

00:26:24.190 --> 00:26:27.180 align:middle line:84%
begin to see where the
patterns end, where they begin.

00:26:27.180 --> 00:26:29.320 align:middle line:84%
All of a sudden, these
are the a-ha moments.

00:26:29.320 --> 00:26:31.480 align:middle line:90%
First of all, you say, a-ha!

00:26:31.480 --> 00:26:34.120 align:middle line:84%
Wow, look at that pattern
hat has played out

00:26:34.120 --> 00:26:37.660 align:middle line:84%
in my relationships-- in my
most intimate relationships.

00:26:37.660 --> 00:26:41.260 align:middle line:84%
Look at the patterns of sabotage
where I've sabotaged myself

00:26:41.260 --> 00:26:43.930 align:middle line:84%
based upon events that happened
so long ago I don't even

00:26:43.930 --> 00:26:45.460 align:middle line:90%
remember when they were.

00:26:45.460 --> 00:26:48.430 align:middle line:84%
Or look at those patterns
of loss and betrayal.

00:26:48.430 --> 00:26:51.710 align:middle line:84%
And third, when we
recognize those patterns,

00:26:51.710 --> 00:26:54.370 align:middle line:84%
we recognize, once
again, the places where

00:26:54.370 --> 00:26:58.240 align:middle line:90%
our choices are most potent.

00:26:58.240 --> 00:27:01.330 align:middle line:84%
So the key to everything
that we're saying right now

00:27:01.330 --> 00:27:04.255 align:middle line:84%
is to recognize, number one,
that these patterns exist,

00:27:04.255 --> 00:27:08.630 align:middle line:84%
but number two, you and I are
not slaves to these patterns.

00:27:08.630 --> 00:27:13.210 align:middle line:84%
These patterns direct
general fields of energy

00:27:13.210 --> 00:27:16.330 align:middle line:84%
and when the conditions
of a seed event

00:27:16.330 --> 00:27:17.950 align:middle line:90%
may repeat in our lives.

00:27:17.950 --> 00:27:21.280 align:middle line:84%
We are free will
beings in this world,

00:27:21.280 --> 00:27:24.065 align:middle line:84%
and we have the opportunity to
make our choices at any time

00:27:24.065 --> 00:27:26.470 align:middle line:84%
when we recognize that
the patterns are actually

00:27:26.470 --> 00:27:28.780 align:middle line:90%
playing out.

00:27:28.780 --> 00:27:30.670 align:middle line:84%
So we've just covered
a lot of ground,

00:27:30.670 --> 00:27:33.100 align:middle line:84%
and I'm going to acknowledge
that, for a lot of people,

00:27:33.100 --> 00:27:34.516 align:middle line:84%
this is a very,
very different way

00:27:34.516 --> 00:27:38.120 align:middle line:84%
to think about our world,
as well as our lives.

00:27:38.120 --> 00:27:39.910 align:middle line:84%
So I want to reiterate
a couple of points

00:27:39.910 --> 00:27:44.500 align:middle line:84%
as we go into the next episode
of "The Divine Matrix."

00:27:44.500 --> 00:27:46.270 align:middle line:90%
We talk about the cycles.

00:27:46.270 --> 00:27:50.320 align:middle line:84%
These are rhythms and
patterns that are playing out.

00:27:50.320 --> 00:27:53.290 align:middle line:84%
However, they do not
dictate precisely what

00:27:53.290 --> 00:27:54.590 align:middle line:90%
happens in our lives.

00:27:54.590 --> 00:27:56.410 align:middle line:84%
They simply show us
when the conditions--

00:27:56.410 --> 00:27:57.850 align:middle line:90%
the opportunities--

00:27:57.850 --> 00:28:01.570 align:middle line:84%
for events to unfold are
appearing in our lives.

00:28:01.570 --> 00:28:04.210 align:middle line:84%
Once we recognize
these natural rhythms

00:28:04.210 --> 00:28:06.430 align:middle line:84%
and these natural
cycles, we can work

00:28:06.430 --> 00:28:08.770 align:middle line:84%
with the rhythms,
work with the cycles

00:28:08.770 --> 00:28:10.750 align:middle line:84%
to bring about positive
change in the world,

00:28:10.750 --> 00:28:14.430 align:middle line:84%
as well as positive
change in our lives.

00:28:14.430 --> 00:28:16.900 align:middle line:84%
Whether the cycles are playing
out on the smaller scale,

00:28:16.900 --> 00:28:19.180 align:middle line:84%
at a personal level,
or in a large scale--

00:28:19.180 --> 00:28:20.620 align:middle line:90%
the global level--

00:28:20.620 --> 00:28:22.630 align:middle line:84%
our lives are unfolding
within the container

00:28:22.630 --> 00:28:24.610 align:middle line:90%
of the divine matrix.

00:28:24.610 --> 00:28:29.080 align:middle line:84%
In the next episode, we'll
explore the 3,000-year-old map

00:28:29.080 --> 00:28:32.470 align:middle line:84%
of time that holds the key
to where the cycles lead

00:28:32.470 --> 00:28:36.325 align:middle line:84%
and the secret to our personal
as well as our global destiny.

00:28:36.325 --> 00:28:38.200 align:middle line:84%
Thank you for joining
me for today's program,

00:28:38.200 --> 00:28:41.440 align:middle line:84%
and be sure to tune in for our
next all-new episode of "The

00:28:41.440 --> 00:28:42.910 align:middle line:90%
Divine Matrix--

00:28:42.910 --> 00:28:47.070 align:middle line:84%
Bridging Time, Space,
Miracles, and Belief."

00:28:47.070 --> 00:28:56.726 align:middle line:90%
