once a planet similar to Earth.

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:36.570 align:middle line:10%
According to research conducted
by different scientists

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:40.320 align:middle line:10%
from various specialty
fields, Mars once

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:45.860 align:middle line:10%
had oceans, vegetation, and
possibly human or alien life.

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:48.990 align:middle line:84%
Several likelihoods
have been suggested

00:00:48.990 --> 00:00:54.420 align:middle line:84%
that would explain how Mars
could have lost its ecosystem

available about life on Mars is

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:07.950 align:middle line:84%
that the Red Planet was once
habitable for living things,

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:10.470 align:middle line:90%
until about 4 million years ago.

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:12.870 align:middle line:84%
As published in the
magazine, "Science,"

00:01:12.870 --> 00:01:16.650 align:middle line:84%
the most detailed and complete
analysis of Mars atmosphere

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:20.820 align:middle line:84%
came from data obtained
by the robot, Curiosity.

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:23.040 align:middle line:84%
The Red Planet was
much like Earth.

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:25.200 align:middle line:84%
The results indicate
that Mars once

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:27.570 align:middle line:84%
had a dense atmosphere,
which supports

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:29.640 align:middle line:84%
the view that the
planet's surface was

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:32.610 align:middle line:90%
warm and humid at one point.

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:35.790 align:middle line:84%

And now, for the first time,
the results of its data

00:01:41.370 --> 00:01:45.585 align:middle line:84%
provides a clearer picture of
how much water Mars has lost.

00:01:48.510 --> 00:01:50.610 align:middle line:84%
How much has the
atmosphere changed,

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:53.700 align:middle line:84%
and what kind of atmosphere
did it have in the past?

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:56.220 align:middle line:84%
We believe that the
dense atmosphere of Mars

00:01:56.220 --> 00:01:58.620 align:middle line:84%
was protected from
strong solar wind

00:01:58.620 --> 00:02:01.260 align:middle line:84%
by the magnetic
field of the planet.

00:02:01.260 --> 00:02:04.080 align:middle line:84%
This would support the theory
that the surface of the planet

00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:06.780 align:middle line:90%
was warm and had running water.

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:10.259 align:middle line:84%
Some scientists believe that
its magnetic field collapsed

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:12.030 align:middle line:84%
and that the atmosphere
was gradually

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:14.430 align:middle line:84%
destroyed by solar
winds, leaving

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:17.970 align:middle line:84%
the planet dry and
desolate, as it is today.

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:20.970 align:middle line:84%
Other scientists think that
it was volcanic activity that

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:23.010 align:middle line:90%
ended life on Mars.

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:25.410 align:middle line:84%
A group of American
and French scientists,

00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:29.460 align:middle line:84%
led by researcher Sylvain
Goulet say that tons of lava

00:02:29.460 --> 00:02:33.300 align:middle line:84%
flowed with such intensity
that it poured over the crust

00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:36.090 align:middle line:84%
and mantle of Mars,
covering the surface

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:39.120 align:middle line:84%
and preventing any
life to exist there.

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:42.180 align:middle line:84%
This volcanic rock and
lava flooded the surface

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:45.300 align:middle line:84%
with such intensity
that it caused the crust

00:02:45.300 --> 00:02:48.100 align:middle line:84%
to move and change
its center of gravity,

00:02:48.100 --> 00:02:51.910 align:middle line:84%
which activated the planet
to alter its orientation.

00:02:51.910 --> 00:02:55.080 align:middle line:84%
However, others claim that the
destruction and annihilation

00:02:55.080 --> 00:02:59.040 align:middle line:84%
of the Mars atmosphere was
due to a nuclear war that

00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:02.160 align:middle line:90%
killed all life on the planet.

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:06.930 align:middle line:84%
Dr. John Brandenburg claims
that large amounts of xenon-129

00:03:06.930 --> 00:03:09.570 align:middle line:84%
have been found on
the surface of Mars.

00:03:09.570 --> 00:03:12.360 align:middle line:84%
He even published an image
that would show where

00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:14.730 align:middle line:90%
those explosions occurred.

00:03:14.730 --> 00:03:18.000 align:middle line:84%
According to Brandenburg,
the color red, in this image,

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:21.930 align:middle line:84%
shows high concentrations
of radioactive material.

00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:26.380 align:middle line:84%
Brandenburg authored a book,
titled "Death on Mars."

00:03:26.380 --> 00:03:28.290 align:middle line:10%
And I quote his words.

00:03:28.290 --> 00:03:31.950 align:middle line:10%
"Consider the large number of
nuclear isotopes in the Martian

00:03:31.950 --> 00:03:35.610 align:middle line:10%
atmosphere and that those
same residual isotopes,

00:03:35.610 --> 00:03:38.040 align:middle line:10%
from hydrogen bomb
tests on Earth,

00:03:38.040 --> 00:03:41.370 align:middle line:10%
are also found in
Mars's atmosphere.

00:03:41.370 --> 00:03:44.640 align:middle line:10%
Mars could be an example of
a civilization devastated

00:03:44.640 --> 00:03:47.760 align:middle line:10%
by a nuclear attack from space."

00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:50.760 align:middle line:10%
I continue to quote
Dr. Brandenburg.

00:03:50.760 --> 00:03:53.220 align:middle line:10%
"Fortunately, we are
warned of this calamity

00:03:53.220 --> 00:03:55.170 align:middle line:10%
that could happen to us.

00:03:55.170 --> 00:03:58.590 align:middle line:10%

for a manned mission to Mars

00:03:58.590 --> 00:04:00.990 align:middle line:10%
to be planned

00:04:00.990 --> 00:04:04.230 align:middle line:10%

Dr. Brandenburg is undoubtedly
one of the most qualified

00:04:33.060 --> 00:04:36.060 align:middle line:84%
voices to make a

00:04:36.060 --> 00:04:39.120 align:middle line:84%
that Mars was destroyed
by a nuclear war.

00:05:01.030 --> 00:05:04.420 align:middle line:84%
spoke further about his
extraordinary discoveries.

00:05:04.420 --> 00:05:08.900 align:middle line:90%


00:05:08.900 --> 00:05:12.500 align:middle line:84%
>> I got involved in an
investigation of these

00:05:12.500 --> 00:05:14.010 align:middle line:90%
interesting things on Mars.

00:05:14.010 --> 00:05:16.370 align:middle line:84%
And then because I'm
a trained scientist,

00:05:16.370 --> 00:05:18.080 align:middle line:84%
I basically just
became an expert

00:05:18.080 --> 00:05:24.720 align:middle line:84%
on Mars geochemistry and
evidence for past life on Mars.

00:05:24.720 --> 00:05:29.240 align:middle line:84%
And then later, when
we became acquainted

00:05:29.240 --> 00:05:33.470 align:middle line:84%
with the very strange
nuclear data from Mars,

00:05:33.470 --> 00:05:42.590 align:middle line:84%
my training in nuclear physics
came back, and also weapons--

00:05:42.590 --> 00:05:44.270 align:middle line:90%
nuclear weapons physics.

00:05:44.270 --> 00:05:48.440 align:middle line:84%
I was able to put that all
together and figure out--

00:05:48.440 --> 00:05:52.670 align:middle line:84%
to propose this theory as
a coherent, logical theory.

00:05:52.670 --> 00:05:56.250 align:middle line:84%
>> And what is it that you
propose happened on Mars?

00:05:56.250 --> 00:06:01.940 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, Mars looks like the
Earth would look like after

00:06:01.940 --> 00:06:03.890 align:middle line:90%
a big nuclear war.

00:06:03.890 --> 00:06:05.870 align:middle line:90%
It's a kind of destroyed planet.

00:06:05.870 --> 00:06:08.180 align:middle line:90%
It used to have an ocean.

00:06:08.180 --> 00:06:10.400 align:middle line:90%
It's bright red.

00:06:10.400 --> 00:06:13.500 align:middle line:10%
If you look at pictures
of Earth from space,

00:06:13.500 --> 00:06:15.980 align:middle line:10%
of deserts on Earth,
like the Sahara Desert,

00:06:15.980 --> 00:06:19.340 align:middle line:10%
it's bright red because of
the oxygen in the Earth's

00:06:19.340 --> 00:06:22.400 align:middle line:10%
atmosphere oxidizes
the iron in the soil

00:06:22.400 --> 00:06:25.370 align:middle line:10%
from being a low
oxidation state,

00:06:25.370 --> 00:06:31.550 align:middle line:10%
a black iron called ferrous,
to a bright red variety called

00:06:31.550 --> 00:06:34.100 align:middle line:10%
hematite, or ferric iron.

00:06:34.100 --> 00:06:37.920 align:middle line:84%
It's also what gives our
blood the bright red color.

00:06:37.920 --> 00:06:43.370 align:middle line:84%
And so Mars looks
like a planet that

00:06:43.370 --> 00:06:46.400 align:middle line:90%
has been devastated by some--

00:06:46.400 --> 00:06:50.690 align:middle line:84%
that was once Earth-like but has
now, because of some cataclysm,

00:06:50.690 --> 00:06:55.190 align:middle line:84%
become dead and
almost moon-like.

00:06:55.190 --> 00:06:59.700 align:middle line:90%
And so it's a very confusing--

00:06:59.700 --> 00:07:03.710 align:middle line:84%
it's a very confusing
picture we have on Mars.

00:07:03.710 --> 00:07:08.480 align:middle line:84%
You may be aware that the Mars
rover has been driving around

00:07:08.480 --> 00:07:12.230 align:middle line:84%
in uncovered sediments,
apparently laid down.

00:07:12.230 --> 00:07:14.845 align:middle line:84%
And they're halfway up
the side of a mountain,

00:07:14.845 --> 00:07:16.220 align:middle line:84%
and they discover
the mountain is

00:07:16.220 --> 00:07:18.950 align:middle line:84%
made of sediments,
laid down, apparently,

00:07:18.950 --> 00:07:21.290 align:middle line:90%
in an ocean or lake.

00:07:21.290 --> 00:07:23.060 align:middle line:90%
And they're bright red.

00:07:23.060 --> 00:07:25.970 align:middle line:84%
And they look just like
something on Earth.

00:07:25.970 --> 00:07:30.410 align:middle line:84%
They look just like a road
cut in upper-state New York

00:07:30.410 --> 00:07:34.130 align:middle line:84%
or in the Midwest, which
used to have an ocean in it,

00:07:34.130 --> 00:07:38.510 align:middle line:90%
and positively Earth-like.

00:07:38.510 --> 00:07:42.080 align:middle line:84%
And this is from the
middle age of Mars,

00:07:42.080 --> 00:07:47.310 align:middle line:84%
indicating that Mars was
very Earth for a long time.

00:07:47.310 --> 00:07:51.470 align:middle line:84%
But what the basic
finding has been

00:07:51.470 --> 00:07:58.970 align:middle line:84%
is that, looking at nuclear
data from Mars meteorites

00:07:58.970 --> 00:08:01.192 align:middle line:84%
and satellites that
have orbited Mars

00:08:01.192 --> 00:08:02.900 align:middle line:84%
and can look right
through the atmosphere

00:08:02.900 --> 00:08:05.720 align:middle line:84%
and monitor gamma
rays, there are

00:08:05.720 --> 00:08:09.500 align:middle line:84%
two large radioactive
hot spots on Mars.

00:08:09.500 --> 00:08:13.060 align:middle line:84%
In radioactive
potassium and thorium--

00:08:13.060 --> 00:08:16.130 align:middle line:84%
you can actually
go on the internet

00:08:16.130 --> 00:08:19.250 align:middle line:84%
and just say "thorium
maps of Mars"

00:08:19.250 --> 00:08:22.190 align:middle line:84%
or "potassium maps of Mars,"
and they'll show them.

00:08:22.190 --> 00:08:25.670 align:middle line:84%
You can see there's
two hot spots on Mars.

00:08:25.670 --> 00:08:30.440 align:middle line:84%
And they look as though
something exploded

00:08:30.440 --> 00:08:33.740 align:middle line:84%
at those places and
spread a debris pattern

00:08:33.740 --> 00:08:36.020 align:middle line:90%
all the way around the planet.

00:08:36.020 --> 00:08:37.880 align:middle line:84%
It created a shock
wave, apparently,

00:08:37.880 --> 00:08:39.710 align:middle line:84%
that wrapped all the
way around the planet

00:08:39.710 --> 00:08:42.860 align:middle line:84%
and ran into itself on the other
side of the planet, at a place

00:08:42.860 --> 00:08:47.050 align:middle line:84%
called antipode, the
opposite point on the globe,

00:08:47.050 --> 00:08:50.030 align:middle line:84%
and piled up a bunch of
radioactive debris there.

00:08:50.030 --> 00:08:52.520 align:middle line:84%
So the potassium
and thorium looks

00:08:52.520 --> 00:08:55.820 align:middle line:84%
as though there was a
large explosion, especially

00:08:55.820 --> 00:09:00.717 align:middle line:84%
at a place called Mare
Acidalium was the biggest one.

00:09:00.717 --> 00:09:02.300 align:middle line:84%
And there was a
smaller one in a place

00:09:02.300 --> 00:09:05.390 align:middle line:90%
called the Plains of Utopia.

00:09:05.390 --> 00:09:12.320 align:middle line:84%
So the theory is
that, apparently, Mars

00:09:12.320 --> 00:09:16.950 align:middle line:84%
suffered a very large nuclear
explosion, or a very large one

00:09:16.950 --> 00:09:18.530 align:middle line:90%
and a smaller one.

00:09:18.530 --> 00:09:21.800 align:middle line:84%
This also filled the Mars
atmosphere with residues

00:09:21.800 --> 00:09:26.240 align:middle line:84%
from nuclear reactions,
particularly xenon gas,

00:09:26.240 --> 00:09:29.990 align:middle line:84%
which is found in
flash strobe lights.

00:09:29.990 --> 00:09:33.650 align:middle line:90%
It's a very heavy gas.

00:09:33.650 --> 00:09:36.950 align:middle line:84%
And it has an
isotopic fingerprint

00:09:36.950 --> 00:09:39.110 align:middle line:84%
so you can tell what
kind of nuclear reactions

00:09:39.110 --> 00:09:43.700 align:middle line:84%
created the xenon that's
there by measuring

00:09:43.700 --> 00:09:49.210 align:middle line:84%
the ratio of which type
of isotope like on Earth,

00:09:49.210 --> 00:09:50.915 align:middle line:90%
in the sun, on Jupiter.

00:09:50.915 --> 00:09:53.810 align:middle line:90%


00:09:53.810 --> 00:10:01.520 align:middle line:84%
The isotope of xenon called
was xenon-129 and xenon-132

00:10:01.520 --> 00:10:04.950 align:middle line:84%
are almost equal everywhere
in the solar system.

00:10:04.950 --> 00:10:08.190 align:middle line:84%
In fact, meteorites-- they
break open the meteorites.

00:10:08.190 --> 00:10:09.210 align:middle line:90%
They extract the gas.

00:10:09.210 --> 00:10:15.370 align:middle line:84%
From the xenon, gas is almost
equal xenon-129 and xenon-132.

00:10:15.370 --> 00:10:20.670 align:middle line:84%
But on Mars, xenon-129 is
two and a half times greater

00:10:20.670 --> 00:10:23.430 align:middle line:90%
than the 132.

00:10:23.430 --> 00:10:29.610 align:middle line:84%
This is like a detective coming
and finding a shell casing,

00:10:29.610 --> 00:10:33.480 align:middle line:84%
or a bullet, a spent
bullet implanted in a wall.

00:10:33.480 --> 00:10:38.750 align:middle line:84%
And he looks at the shell
casing and the bullet.

00:10:38.750 --> 00:10:41.070 align:middle line:84%
He looks at the rifling
marks on the bullet.

00:10:41.070 --> 00:10:44.850 align:middle line:84%
He can figure out what kind
of gun fired that bullet.

00:10:44.850 --> 00:10:48.630 align:middle line:84%
And this is a kind
of nuclear forensics.

00:10:48.630 --> 00:10:54.345 align:middle line:84%
And what happens is this
is weapons signature.

00:10:54.345 --> 00:10:57.450 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:10:57.450 --> 00:11:00.630 align:middle line:84%
>> According to Brandenburg,
his first theory was that

00:11:00.630 --> 00:11:04.320 align:middle line:84%
the explosions could have been
natural when large deposits

00:11:04.320 --> 00:11:06.910 align:middle line:84%
of enriched uranium
were present.

00:11:06.910 --> 00:11:09.510 align:middle line:84%
However, this did not
explain the reason xenon

00:11:09.510 --> 00:11:13.530 align:middle line:84%
gas 129 was present,
which can only occur when

00:11:13.530 --> 00:11:16.830 align:middle line:90%
a nuclear weapon is detonated.

00:11:16.830 --> 00:11:18.480 align:middle line:84%
It is also interesting
to note there

00:11:18.480 --> 00:11:21.660 align:middle line:84%
are no extremely large
craters on Mars that

00:11:21.660 --> 00:11:25.110 align:middle line:84%
would have been formed by an
explosion of that magnitude.

00:11:25.110 --> 00:11:28.740 align:middle line:84%
That's because the explosion
occurred in Mars atmosphere,

00:11:28.740 --> 00:11:30.690 align:middle line:90%
not on the surface.

00:11:30.690 --> 00:11:33.390 align:middle line:84%
He says the incident was
not caused naturally.

00:11:33.390 --> 00:11:36.390 align:middle line:84%
It was the result
of a nuclear weapon.

00:11:36.390 --> 00:11:38.640 align:middle line:84%
When asked what the
size of a nuclear bomb

00:11:38.640 --> 00:11:41.500 align:middle line:84%
would have been to create
that kind of destruction,

00:11:41.500 --> 00:11:44.460 align:middle line:84%
this was John
Brandenburg's response.

00:11:44.460 --> 00:11:47.340 align:middle line:84%
>> This was a hydrogen bomb
as big as the Empire State

00:11:47.340 --> 00:11:48.870 align:middle line:90%
Building.

00:11:48.870 --> 00:11:52.710 align:middle line:84%
This was absolutely-- it
was a billion megatons.

00:11:52.710 --> 00:11:57.100 align:middle line:84%
>> And you propose that it
wiped out the entire planet.

00:11:57.100 --> 00:11:57.900 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, yeah.

00:11:57.900 --> 00:12:00.330 align:middle line:84%
Its explosion would have
absolutely devastated

00:12:00.330 --> 00:12:03.630 align:middle line:90%
the entire planet.

00:12:03.630 --> 00:12:06.900 align:middle line:84%
It would have ripped
most the atmosphere off

00:12:06.900 --> 00:12:10.620 align:middle line:84%
and spread radioactive debris
all over the entire planet,

00:12:10.620 --> 00:12:14.850 align:middle line:84%
which would have
killed all life--

00:12:14.850 --> 00:12:16.200 align:middle line:90%
basically sterilized the planet.

00:12:16.200 --> 00:12:19.500 align:middle line:84%
Only the most rugged,
most primitive bacteria

00:12:19.500 --> 00:12:20.380 align:middle line:90%
would have survived.

by one, or possibly two
major nuclear explosions

00:12:38.590 --> 00:12:40.300 align:middle line:90%

This occurrence of another
nuclear explosion on Mars

00:13:09.010 --> 00:13:13.180 align:middle line:84%
was recorded on
October 19, 2014.

00:13:13.180 --> 00:13:15.460 align:middle line:84%
It happened almost
at the same time

00:13:15.460 --> 00:13:19.900 align:middle line:84%
that the comet, Siding Springs,
passed by the Red Planet,

00:13:19.900 --> 00:13:25.590 align:middle line:84%
engulfing the entire
planet in a dust trail.

the moment at which the comet,

00:13:29.190 --> 00:13:32.670 align:middle line:84%
Siding Spring,
passed close to Mars.

00:13:32.670 --> 00:13:36.240 align:middle line:84%
You can clearly see that an
extremely large explosion

00:13:36.240 --> 00:13:37.620 align:middle line:90%
happened there.

00:13:37.620 --> 00:13:40.830 align:middle line:84%
It has been ruled out that this
is a fragment of the comet.

00:13:40.830 --> 00:13:44.020 align:middle line:84%
It must have been a
nuclear explosion.

00:13:44.020 --> 00:13:46.020 align:middle line:84%
But the most noteworthy
thing that happened

00:13:46.020 --> 00:13:49.200 align:middle line:84%
was that NASA cut the
live broadcast just

00:13:49.200 --> 00:13:53.860 align:middle line:84%
before the moment the
explosion near Mars took place.

00:13:53.860 --> 00:13:59.130 align:middle line:84%
This is clear evidence of an
effort to cover up the event.

There were many
internet news sites

that exclaimed that the
astronomer, Dr. Fritz Helmut

00:14:04.560 --> 00:14:08.340 align:middle line:10%
Hemmerich, managed to record
the nuclear explosion on Mars,

00:14:08.340 --> 00:14:11.940 align:middle line:10%
during the tracking of the
comet, Siding Spring, which

00:14:11.940 --> 00:14:14.250 align:middle line:10%
happened near the Red Planet.

00:14:14.250 --> 00:14:18.780 align:middle line:10%
Dr. Hemmerich recorded the
video using a 14-inch telescope,

thought that what

00:15:17.530 --> 00:15:20.440 align:middle line:84%
appeared to be the flash
of a big explosion in Dr.

00:15:20.440 --> 00:15:24.760 align:middle line:84%
Hemmerich's short video
was just an overexposure.

00:15:24.760 --> 00:15:27.970 align:middle line:10%
But nobody expected that
the India Space Research

00:15:27.970 --> 00:15:31.570 align:middle line:10%
Organization, ISRO,
would publish images

00:15:31.570 --> 00:15:33.700 align:middle line:10%
that supported the event.

00:15:33.700 --> 00:15:36.790 align:middle line:84%
Those images occurred at
the same time as the video

of the nuclear explosion

00:15:39.790 --> 00:15:42.790 align:middle line:90%
in the Mars atmosphere.

00:15:42.790 --> 00:15:44.920 align:middle line:84%
Look at this image
carefully and you

00:15:44.920 --> 00:15:47.710 align:middle line:84%
can see the classic
remnants, or fungus, as it's

00:15:47.710 --> 00:15:51.250 align:middle line:90%
called, of a nuclear explosion.

00:15:51.250 --> 00:15:57.070 align:middle line:84%
Here, you see the so-called
trunk of the explosion.

Some experts have ruled
out possible causes

00:15:59.800 --> 00:16:02.710 align:middle line:84%
of the mushroom-shaped
cloud, such as surface

00:16:02.710 --> 00:16:06.670 align:middle line:84%
wind or a methane explosion,
leaving only the fact of what

00:16:06.670 --> 00:16:11.230 align:middle line:84%
we have recorded, that it was
an actual nuclear explosion

00:16:11.230 --> 00:16:12.955 align:middle line:90%

that methane that was recently
discovered by the Curiosity

as a cause of the explosion.

The quantities of
methane on Mars

00:16:39.280 --> 00:16:43.060 align:middle line:84%
are too small to cause an
explosion of this type.

happened on Mars, that perhaps

00:16:52.360 --> 00:16:56.560 align:middle line:84%
until a few thousand years ago,
Mars was very much like earth

00:16:56.560 --> 00:17:00.670 align:middle line:84%
but was destroyed
by a nuclear war.

Our investigation
also establishes

00:17:02.830 --> 00:17:05.440 align:middle line:84%
that nuclear explosions
of this magnitude

00:17:05.440 --> 00:17:08.230 align:middle line:90%
have continued to transpire.

what is it that NASA is hiding
behind these images that

00:17:55.240 --> 00:17:58.450 align:middle line:84%

Complete sections of
the Martian surface

00:18:02.170 --> 00:18:05.740 align:middle line:10%
were copied, moved, and pasted
in places where they were not

00:18:05.740 --> 00:18:07.510 align:middle line:10%
previously found.

00:18:07.510 --> 00:18:11.260 align:middle line:10%
Let's take a closer look
at NASA's photo montages.

00:18:11.260 --> 00:18:14.410 align:middle line:84%

00:18:17.950 --> 00:18:20.290 align:middle line:84%
Look carefully at
these two photographs.

00:18:20.290 --> 00:18:22.750 align:middle line:84%
On the right, we see
the Google Earth photo,

00:18:22.750 --> 00:18:27.100 align:middle line:84%
before the arrival of the
Curiosity rover on Mars.

00:18:27.100 --> 00:18:29.890 align:middle line:84%
And look how the
formation appears.

00:18:29.890 --> 00:18:32.200 align:middle line:84%
In the image on
the left, in color,

00:18:32.200 --> 00:18:34.480 align:middle line:84%

in the program Mars Exploration
for the Curiosity mission.

00:18:40.330 --> 00:18:42.910 align:middle line:10%
We carried out our
own analysis and can

00:18:42.910 --> 00:18:46.960 align:middle line:10%

showing us false photographs

00:18:46.960 --> 00:18:48.520 align:middle line:10%

00:18:48.520 --> 00:18:49.690 align:middle line:90%
Watch carefully.

00:18:49.690 --> 00:18:52.300 align:middle line:84%
This is NASA's virtual

00:18:52.300 --> 00:18:54.700 align:middle line:84%

of the probe satellite

00:18:54.700 --> 00:18:55.660 align:middle line:90%
that orbits Mars.

00:18:55.660 --> 00:18:58.360 align:middle line:90%


00:18:58.360 --> 00:19:04.870 align:middle line:84%
Here are the areas that were
copied, moved, and pasted.

00:19:04.870 --> 00:19:06.220 align:middle line:90%
Now watch this.

00:19:06.220 --> 00:19:10.910 align:middle line:84%
We select the false area on
the left that appears darker.

00:19:10.910 --> 00:19:14.420 align:middle line:84%
We move it by placing it in
the middle of the screen.

00:19:14.420 --> 00:19:17.320 align:middle line:84%
Now we select the
original zone and place it

00:19:17.320 --> 00:19:21.040 align:middle line:84%
on top of the other one,
verifying that they are exactly

00:19:21.040 --> 00:19:23.630 align:middle line:90%
the same shape.

00:19:23.630 --> 00:19:26.380 align:middle line:84%
Finally, we paste the
darkest zone in the place

00:19:26.380 --> 00:19:30.250 align:middle line:84%
where it was copied, and
it matches perfectly,

00:19:30.250 --> 00:19:35.280 align:middle line:84%
which verifies the NASA
photo image had been altered.

00:19:35.280 --> 00:19:37.410 align:middle line:84%
Researcher Linda
Moulton, of Earthfiles,

00:19:37.410 --> 00:19:40.080 align:middle line:84%
completed an extensive
special investigation

00:19:40.080 --> 00:19:42.960 align:middle line:84%
of the false images
that NASA released.

00:19:42.960 --> 00:19:48.120 align:middle line:84%
This report was exclusively
for Third Millennium.

00:19:48.120 --> 00:19:53.950 align:middle line:10%
>> On September 19, I got a very
puzzling and disturbing email.

00:19:53.950 --> 00:19:58.080 align:middle line:10%
It was from a man who was
calling himself Sun's Flare.

00:19:58.080 --> 00:20:02.190 align:middle line:10%
And it was a URL link.

00:20:02.190 --> 00:20:07.620 align:middle line:10%
And the headline was,
"why is NASA faking images

00:20:07.620 --> 00:20:10.380 align:middle line:10%
on Mars in Gale Crater?"

00:20:10.380 --> 00:20:14.430 align:middle line:10%
And that's where Curiosity
had landed was in Gale Crater.

00:20:14.430 --> 00:20:17.490 align:middle line:10%
So this is what I did.

00:20:17.490 --> 00:20:18.780 align:middle line:90%
I opened up--

00:20:18.780 --> 00:20:20.363 align:middle line:84%
>> (ON VIDEO) Hello,
Sun's Flare here.

00:20:20.363 --> 00:20:21.645 align:middle line:90%
It is September 19, 2012.

00:20:21.645 --> 00:20:25.410 align:middle line:10%
We're taking a look at the
Gale Crater composite image,

00:20:25.410 --> 00:20:30.975 align:middle line:10%
by NASA's JPL on the explore
mars Curiosity program.

00:20:30.975 --> 00:20:32.930 align:middle line:10%
A little zoom in here--

00:20:32.930 --> 00:20:37.100 align:middle line:10%
and what I'd like to
point out is this.

00:20:37.100 --> 00:20:39.810 align:middle line:10%
In the previous
video, I pointed out

00:20:39.810 --> 00:20:46.890 align:middle line:10%
this section where it was
not visible in a prior image,

00:20:46.890 --> 00:20:49.120 align:middle line:10%
yet it is here.

00:20:49.120 --> 00:20:51.910 align:middle line:10%
So this is very
intriguing to me.

00:20:51.910 --> 00:20:55.724 align:middle line:10%
And I may have more
explanation why this is.

00:20:55.724 --> 00:20:58.980 align:middle line:84%
>> These are official
photographs from the US space

00:20:58.980 --> 00:20:59.820 align:middle line:90%
agency.

00:20:59.820 --> 00:21:03.090 align:middle line:84%
But unfortunately, they
are not entirely correct.

00:21:03.090 --> 00:21:05.100 align:middle line:90%
They are not the originals.

00:21:05.100 --> 00:21:08.730 align:middle line:84%
This is demonstrated by the
analysis of Linda Moulton.

00:21:08.730 --> 00:21:12.275 align:middle line:84%
Now watch carefully as she
unveils more surprises.

00:21:12.275 --> 00:21:16.900 align:middle line:10%
>> And as Sun's
Flare pointed out,

00:21:16.900 --> 00:21:22.690 align:middle line:10%
this whole area seems to have
been brought from someplace

00:21:22.690 --> 00:21:24.170 align:middle line:10%
else.

00:21:24.170 --> 00:21:30.700 align:middle line:10%
And the Navy captain that I went
to for help sent me an email

00:21:30.700 --> 00:21:35.080 align:middle line:10%
and said Linda, if you look
at the large gullies and rock

00:21:35.080 --> 00:21:39.910 align:middle line:10%
features to the immediate left
of the so-called panhandle

00:21:39.910 --> 00:21:46.810 align:middle line:10%
lake, the whole area has been
pasted in from a different Gale

00:21:46.810 --> 00:21:48.620 align:middle line:10%
Crater section.

00:21:48.620 --> 00:21:55.210 align:middle line:10%
So now, he did a loop
here, with arrows showing

00:21:55.210 --> 00:21:59.590 align:middle line:10%
that this was moved or copied.

00:21:59.590 --> 00:22:01.810 align:middle line:10%
This is a copy and paste.

00:22:01.810 --> 00:22:04.840 align:middle line:10%
These rocks and
gullies were copied,

00:22:04.840 --> 00:22:10.150 align:middle line:10%
and now they're pasted
over to the left of what

00:22:10.150 --> 00:22:15.460 align:middle line:10%
was the original, hi-res,
strange lake-like feature,

00:22:15.460 --> 00:22:17.740 align:middle line:10%
with the three
little islands in it.

00:22:17.740 --> 00:22:22.150 align:middle line:10%
So when you come
back up here, this

00:22:22.150 --> 00:22:32.350 align:middle line:10%
was moved to here to
make this NASA JPL image,

00:22:32.350 --> 00:22:35.035 align:middle line:10%
after Curiosity landed
in Gale Crater--

00:22:35.035 --> 00:22:37.630 align:middle line:10%


00:22:37.630 --> 00:22:40.000 align:middle line:10%
this was not there.

00:22:40.000 --> 00:22:42.100 align:middle line:10%
This was not there.

00:22:42.100 --> 00:22:48.580 align:middle line:10%
This is this strange lake thing
turned, with that panhandle--

00:22:48.580 --> 00:22:50.470 align:middle line:10%
only two islands.

00:22:50.470 --> 00:22:55.600 align:middle line:10%
And everything from
here was moved, copied,

00:22:55.600 --> 00:22:59.380 align:middle line:10%
and pasted there.

00:22:59.380 --> 00:23:02.350 align:middle line:84%
>> In addition to the
existence of altered photos,

00:23:02.350 --> 00:23:06.110 align:middle line:84%
this original image
was somehow inverted.

00:23:06.110 --> 00:23:07.990 align:middle line:90%
North should be at the top.

00:23:07.990 --> 00:23:10.880 align:middle line:84%
But here, it appears
at the bottom.

00:23:10.880 --> 00:23:14.290 align:middle line:10%
>> So now we come back down.

00:23:14.290 --> 00:23:17.740 align:middle line:10%
Here where the original,
the very original,

00:23:17.740 --> 00:23:19.540 align:middle line:10%
images of this area.

00:23:19.540 --> 00:23:24.700 align:middle line:10%
Here is that
strange, little lake.

00:23:24.700 --> 00:23:28.600 align:middle line:10%
Here it is in a tighter closeup,
still in the high resolution.

00:23:28.600 --> 00:23:31.900 align:middle line:10%
This is an enlargement,
high resolution.

00:23:31.900 --> 00:23:36.550 align:middle line:10%
From this side to this side,
it is about a quarter of a mile

00:23:36.550 --> 00:23:38.170 align:middle line:10%
wide.

00:23:38.170 --> 00:23:44.110 align:middle line:10%
Note that we have been viewing
this area with the South on top

00:23:44.110 --> 00:23:46.460 align:middle line:10%
and the north on the bottom.

00:23:46.460 --> 00:23:51.340 align:middle line:10%
And this is not a normal way
for us to think about images.

00:23:51.340 --> 00:23:54.040 align:middle line:10%
We are always looking at images
from the north to the south.

releasing to the public,
