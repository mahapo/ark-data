the Viper F-16C of the

Ground-based air

00:07:34.330 --> 00:07:38.200 align:middle line:84%

that a "flock of birds

00:07:40.510 --> 00:07:43.930 align:middle line:90%

00:07:43.930 --> 00:07:46.630 align:middle line:10%
"The comments you are hearing

"confirm "nor deny that
it was a flock of birds.

00:08:02.440 --> 00:08:06.640 align:middle line:10%
Using the MH-65 to intercept
whatever appeared on the radar

00:08:06.640 --> 00:08:09.790 align:middle line:10%
screens indicates that
the target, real or not,

00:08:09.790 --> 00:08:13.210 align:middle line:10%
was seen as slow, very slow.

00:08:13.210 --> 00:08:17.110 align:middle line:84%
This is backed by another

00:08:17.110 --> 00:08:20.990 align:middle line:84%
an unidentified source from the
United States Capitol Police

00:08:20.990 --> 00:08:25.570 align:middle line:84%

track as a "slow drop."

Another unidentified

00:08:28.300 --> 00:08:31.300 align:middle line:84%
said the Federal
Aviation Administration

00:08:31.300 --> 00:08:33.669 align:middle line:84%
claimed that air
traffic controllers also

00:08:33.669 --> 00:08:37.900 align:middle line:84%
did not see the alleged
runway on their radar screens.

00:08:37.900 --> 00:08:40.659 align:middle line:10%
However, another
unidentified source

00:08:40.659 --> 00:08:45.550 align:middle line:10%
told this outlet that it could
have been a "weather anomaly."

00:08:45.550 --> 00:08:49.390 align:middle line:10%
While exactly what

00:08:49.390 --> 00:08:52.360 align:middle line:10%
the incident and these
sometimes conflicting reports

00:08:52.360 --> 00:08:55.210 align:middle line:10%

and landed on the Capitol lawn

in 2015.

00:09:19.230 --> 00:09:23.190 align:middle line:84%
He was hoping to deliver letters

was widespread corruption

00:09:26.220 --> 00:09:27.600 align:middle line:90%

00:09:27.600 --> 00:09:29.940 align:middle line:84%
Hughes later pleaded
guilty to a felony,

00:09:29.940 --> 00:09:32.700 align:middle line:84%
and spent 120 days
in prison, followed

00:09:32.700 --> 00:09:34.560 align:middle line:90%
by a year of probation.

to the air defense network

00:09:42.270 --> 00:09:45.540 align:middle line:10%
an area collectively referred

00:09:46.560 --> 00:09:48.900 align:middle line:84%

00:10:19.570 --> 00:10:23.080 align:middle line:84%
an alert from personnel working
on the NORAD Distant Early

00:10:23.080 --> 00:10:27.880 align:middle line:84%
Warning Line, DEW radar network,
which initially mistook them

00:10:27.880 --> 00:10:30.280 align:middle line:90%
for massive Soviet bombers.

00:10:30.280 --> 00:10:34.440 align:middle line:84%
When it comes to the air defense
network around Washington, DC,

00:10:34.440 --> 00:10:37.510 align:middle line:84%
even if it detects a real
threat, how to respond

00:10:37.510 --> 00:10:39.790 align:middle line:90%
remains complicated.

00:10:39.790 --> 00:10:43.030 align:middle line:84%
Firing ground to air
or air to air missiles

00:10:43.030 --> 00:10:46.060 align:middle line:84%
at a target over a
densely populated area,

00:10:46.060 --> 00:10:48.280 align:middle line:84%
especially on a
low flying target,

00:10:48.280 --> 00:10:52.270 align:middle line:84%
poses inherent risks of
causing collateral damage.

00:10:52.270 --> 00:10:54.630 align:middle line:84%
The use of automatic
cannons or machine

00:10:54.630 --> 00:10:57.280 align:middle line:84%
guns from airplanes
or ground locations

00:10:57.280 --> 00:11:00.910 align:middle line:84%
still presents dangers
for innocent bystanders.

00:11:00.910 --> 00:11:03.370 align:middle line:84%
It is evident that the
maximum security measures

00:11:03.370 --> 00:11:07.480 align:middle line:84%
were taken in Washington without
so far being able to determine

00:11:07.480 --> 00:11:09.790 align:middle line:90%
what happened.

00:11:09.790 --> 00:11:12.490 align:middle line:84%
The helicopters that
came to the area seconds

00:11:12.490 --> 00:11:16.540 align:middle line:84%
after the alert was
declared found nothing.

00:11:16.540 --> 00:11:19.420 align:middle line:84%
There was nothing in the
skies over Washington.

00:11:19.420 --> 00:11:21.880 align:middle line:84%
However, there is
another possibility.

00:11:21.880 --> 00:12:34.800 align:middle line:90%


00:12:34.800 --> 00:12:39.690 align:middle line:10%
On Saturday, July 19th,
1952, at 11:40 PM,

00:12:39.690 --> 00:12:42.000 align:middle line:10%
Edward Nugent, an air
traffic controller

00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:45.630 align:middle line:10%
at Washington National Airport,
today Ronald Reagan National

00:12:45.630 --> 00:12:48.330 align:middle line:10%
Airport, saw seven
objects on his radar.

00:12:48.330 --> 00:12:51.340 align:middle line:90%


00:12:51.340 --> 00:12:55.030 align:middle line:84%
These were 24 kilometers
south, southwest of the city.

00:12:55.030 --> 00:12:58.260 align:middle line:90%


00:12:58.260 --> 00:13:00.770 align:middle line:10%
There were no known
aircraft in the area,

00:13:00.770 --> 00:13:03.030 align:middle line:10%
and the objects were not
following established flight

00:13:03.030 --> 00:13:03.830 align:middle line:10%
paths.

00:13:03.830 --> 00:13:06.610 align:middle line:90%


00:13:06.610 --> 00:13:10.150 align:middle line:84%
Nugent's superior, Harry
Barnes, a high level airport air

00:13:10.150 --> 00:13:13.120 align:middle line:84%
traffic controller,
saw the objects

00:13:13.120 --> 00:13:15.100 align:middle line:90%
on Nugent's radar screen.

00:13:15.100 --> 00:13:17.950 align:middle line:84%
He later wrote, "We
knew immediately

00:13:17.950 --> 00:13:20.470 align:middle line:84%
that a very strange
situation existed.

00:13:20.470 --> 00:13:22.600 align:middle line:10%
Their movements were
completely radical

00:13:22.600 --> 00:13:25.600 align:middle line:10%
compared to those of
ordinary aircrafts."

00:13:25.600 --> 00:13:29.620 align:middle line:84%
Barnes sent two more controllers
to check Nugent's radar.

00:13:29.620 --> 00:13:33.160 align:middle line:84%
They reported that it
was operating normally.

00:13:33.160 --> 00:13:36.840 align:middle line:84%
Barnes then called another
airport radar center.

00:13:36.840 --> 00:13:38.920 align:middle line:84%
The controller there,
Howard Coughlin,

00:13:38.920 --> 00:13:43.310 align:middle line:84%
told Barnes that he also had
the objects on his radar screen.

00:13:43.310 --> 00:13:45.640 align:middle line:84%
In addition, Coughlin
stated that looking out

00:13:45.640 --> 00:13:47.530 align:middle line:84%
the window of the
control tower, he

00:13:47.530 --> 00:13:51.100 align:middle line:84%
could see one of the objects,
and more specifically,

00:13:51.100 --> 00:13:52.630 align:middle line:90%
a bright orange light.

00:13:52.630 --> 00:13:54.760 align:middle line:90%
I can't tell what's behind it.

00:13:54.760 --> 00:13:56.890 align:middle line:84%
At this point in the
night, other objects

00:13:56.890 --> 00:13:58.990 align:middle line:84%
appeared in all sectors
of the radar screen.

00:13:58.990 --> 00:14:05.300 align:middle line:90%


00:14:05.300 --> 00:14:08.210 align:middle line:84%
When they moved over the White
House and the United States

00:14:08.210 --> 00:14:11.240 align:middle line:84%
Capital, Barnes called
Andrews Air Force Base,

00:14:11.240 --> 00:14:14.030 align:middle line:84%
located 10 miles from
the national airport.

00:14:14.030 --> 00:14:15.740 align:middle line:84%
Although, Andrews
reported that they

00:14:15.740 --> 00:14:18.350 align:middle line:84%
had no unusual objects
on their radar,

00:14:18.350 --> 00:14:21.320 align:middle line:84%
an aviator soon called
the base's control tower

00:14:21.320 --> 00:14:24.020 align:middle line:84%
to report the sighting
of a foreign object.

00:14:24.020 --> 00:14:26.840 align:middle line:84%
Airman William Brady
who was in the tower

00:14:26.840 --> 00:14:30.530 align:middle line:84%
saw an object that appeared to
be like an orange ball of fire

00:14:30.530 --> 00:14:32.690 align:middle line:90%
dragging a tail or trail.

00:14:32.690 --> 00:14:35.060 align:middle line:84%
When Brady attempted to
alert the other staff

00:14:35.060 --> 00:14:37.430 align:middle line:84%
members in the tower,
the strange object

00:14:37.430 --> 00:14:40.490 align:middle line:84%
took off with incredible
speed, he stated.

00:14:40.490 --> 00:14:42.920 align:middle line:84%
Meanwhile, another person
at the control tower

00:14:42.920 --> 00:14:46.850 align:middle line:84%
of the national airport reported
seeing an orange disk nearby

00:14:46.850 --> 00:14:50.480 align:middle line:90%
at about 900 meters high.

00:14:50.480 --> 00:14:53.790 align:middle line:84%
On one of the airport
runways, S.C. Peterman,

00:14:53.790 --> 00:14:56.840 align:middle line:84%
a Capital Airlines pilot,
was waiting for permission

00:14:56.840 --> 00:15:00.560 align:middle line:84%
to take off in the
cabin of his DC4.

00:15:00.560 --> 00:15:03.470 align:middle line:84%
After spotting what he
believes to be a meteorite,

00:15:03.470 --> 00:15:06.980 align:middle line:84%
he was told that unknown
objects near his position

00:15:06.980 --> 00:15:09.890 align:middle line:84%
had been detected on the
control tower's radar.

00:15:09.890 --> 00:15:12.560 align:middle line:84%
For their part at
Andrews Air Force Base,

00:15:12.560 --> 00:15:14.570 align:middle line:84%
control tower
personnel were tracking

00:15:14.570 --> 00:15:17.150 align:middle line:84%
on radar what they believed
to be unknown objects.

00:15:17.150 --> 00:15:24.190 align:middle line:90%


00:15:24.190 --> 00:15:26.530 align:middle line:84%
But others suspected
and in one case

00:15:26.530 --> 00:15:29.080 align:middle line:84%
were able to demonstrate
that they were simply

00:15:29.080 --> 00:15:30.850 align:middle line:90%
stars and meteors.

00:15:30.850 --> 00:15:32.980 align:middle line:84%
However, Sergeant
Charles Davenport

00:15:32.980 --> 00:15:35.920 align:middle line:84%
observed an orange red
light to the south.

00:15:35.920 --> 00:15:37.810 align:middle line:84%
The light appears
to have stopped.

00:15:37.810 --> 00:15:40.360 align:middle line:84%
And then it has made a
sharp change in direction

00:15:40.360 --> 00:15:41.530 align:middle line:90%
in altitude.

00:15:41.530 --> 00:15:43.510 align:middle line:90%
This happened multiple times.

00:15:43.510 --> 00:15:46.720 align:middle line:84%
At one point, the two radar
centers at national airport

00:15:46.720 --> 00:15:49.040 align:middle line:84%
and the one at
Andrews Air Force Base

00:15:49.040 --> 00:15:52.480 align:middle line:84%
where tracking an object
floating on a radio beacon.

00:15:52.480 --> 00:15:55.410 align:middle line:84%
The object disappeared at
all three radar centers

00:15:55.410 --> 00:15:56.590 align:middle line:90%
at the same time.

00:15:56.590 --> 00:16:00.130 align:middle line:84%
At three in the morning, shortly
before two Newcastle Base Air

00:16:00.130 --> 00:16:03.820 align:middle line:84%
Force One F-94 Starfire
fighters in Delaware

00:16:03.820 --> 00:16:06.070 align:middle line:84%
arrived in Washington,
all the objects

00:16:06.070 --> 00:16:09.040 align:middle line:84%
disappeared from the reader
of the national airport.

00:16:09.040 --> 00:16:11.500 align:middle line:84%
However, when the
planes had to refuel,

00:16:11.500 --> 00:16:14.170 align:middle line:84%
the objects returned,
which convinced Barnes

00:16:14.170 --> 00:16:16.840 align:middle line:84%
that the UFOs were
monitoring air traffic,

00:16:16.840 --> 00:16:18.520 align:middle line:90%
behaving accordingly.

00:16:18.520 --> 00:16:22.660 align:middle line:84%
The objects were last detected
on radar at 5:30 near dawn.

00:16:22.660 --> 00:16:27.350 align:middle line:90%


00:16:27.350 --> 00:16:31.210 align:middle line:84%
E.W. Chambers, a civilian radio
engineer from the Washington

00:16:31.210 --> 00:16:34.300 align:middle line:84%
suburbs, observed five
huge discs suspending

00:16:34.300 --> 00:16:35.650 align:middle line:90%
in a loose formation.

00:16:35.650 --> 00:16:39.220 align:middle line:84%
They were leaning up and to
the left in a steep climb.

00:16:39.220 --> 00:16:42.100 align:middle line:10%
A few days later, Major
General John Samford,

00:16:42.100 --> 00:16:44.470 align:middle line:10%
director of intelligence
for the Air Force,

00:16:44.470 --> 00:16:46.780 align:middle line:10%
gave a press conference
to try to explain

00:16:46.780 --> 00:16:48.550 align:middle line:10%
the extraordinary
phenomenon that

00:16:48.550 --> 00:16:51.220 align:middle line:10%
had caused great
expectation in Washington

00:16:51.220 --> 00:16:54.130 align:middle line:10%
and throughout
the United States.

00:16:54.130 --> 00:16:58.000 align:middle line:10%
>> And analyzed to the best of
our ability anything in the air

00:16:58.000 --> 00:17:02.050 align:middle line:10%
that may have the possibility of
threat or menace to the United

00:17:02.050 --> 00:17:03.820 align:middle line:10%
States.

00:17:03.820 --> 00:17:08.260 align:middle line:84%
In pursuit of this
obligation, since 1947

00:17:08.260 --> 00:17:13.150 align:middle line:84%
we have received and analyzed
between 1 and 2,000 reports

00:17:13.150 --> 00:17:16.869 align:middle line:84%
that have come to us from
all kinds of sources.

00:17:16.869 --> 00:17:21.190 align:middle line:84%
Of this great mass of reports
we have been able adequately

00:17:21.190 --> 00:17:24.670 align:middle line:84%
to explain the
great bulk of them,

00:17:24.670 --> 00:17:27.910 align:middle line:84%
explain them to our
own satisfaction.

00:17:27.910 --> 00:17:31.180 align:middle line:84%
We have been able to
explain them as hoaxes,

00:17:31.180 --> 00:17:34.900 align:middle line:84%
as erroneously identified
friendly aircraft,

00:17:34.900 --> 00:17:38.790 align:middle line:84%
as meteorological or
electronic phenomenon,

00:17:38.790 --> 00:17:41.230 align:middle line:90%
or as light aberrations.

00:17:41.230 --> 00:17:43.780 align:middle line:84%
However, there have been
a certain percentage

00:17:43.780 --> 00:17:46.780 align:middle line:84%
of this volume of
reports that have

00:17:46.780 --> 00:17:50.920 align:middle line:84%
been made by credible
observers of relatively

00:17:50.920 --> 00:17:53.830 align:middle line:90%
incredible things.

00:17:53.830 --> 00:17:56.770 align:middle line:84%
It is this group of
observations that we now

00:17:56.770 --> 00:18:00.010 align:middle line:90%
are attempting to resolve.

00:18:00.010 --> 00:18:02.230 align:middle line:84%
Our basic difficulty
in dealing with these

00:18:02.230 --> 00:18:08.110 align:middle line:84%
is that there is no measurement
of them that makes it possible

00:18:08.110 --> 00:18:11.110 align:middle line:84%
for us to put them
in any pattern that

00:18:11.110 --> 00:18:15.970 align:middle line:84%
would be profitable
for a deliberate custom

00:18:15.970 --> 00:18:19.750 align:middle line:84%
sort of analysis to
take the next step.

00:18:19.750 --> 00:18:24.100 align:middle line:84%
We have, as of date, come
to only one firm conclusion

00:18:24.100 --> 00:18:27.240 align:middle line:84%
with respect to this
remaining percentage.

00:18:27.240 --> 00:18:32.950 align:middle line:84%
And that is that it does not
contain any pattern of purpose

00:18:32.950 --> 00:18:36.340 align:middle line:84%
or of consistency
that we can relate

00:18:36.340 --> 00:18:41.020 align:middle line:84%
to any conceivable threat
to the United States.

00:18:41.020 --> 00:18:44.200 align:middle line:84%
>> These are some of the images
captured during that night

00:18:44.200 --> 00:18:45.310 align:middle line:90%
in Washington.

00:18:45.310 --> 00:18:47.650 align:middle line:84%
Thousands of people
observed the UFOs

00:18:47.650 --> 00:18:52.770 align:middle line:84%
during the nights of
July 19 through 20, 1952.

00:18:52.770 --> 00:18:56.740 align:middle line:84%
But the UFOs would
return a week later.

00:18:56.740 --> 00:19:00.750 align:middle line:84%
The sightings from
July 19 to 20, 1952

00:19:00.750 --> 00:19:05.240 align:middle line:84%
were front page in newspapers
across the country.

00:19:05.240 --> 00:19:08.230 align:middle line:84%
One example was the headline
of a newspaper from the "Cedar

00:19:08.230 --> 00:19:12.190 align:middle line:84%
Rapids Gazette" said in Iowa
which said, "Swarm of Saucers

00:19:12.190 --> 00:19:13.690 align:middle line:90%
Over the Capital."

00:19:13.690 --> 00:19:16.210 align:middle line:84%
By coincidence,
Captain Edward Ruppelt,

00:19:16.210 --> 00:19:19.170 align:middle line:84%
supervisor of the Blue Book
Project from the Air Force

00:19:19.170 --> 00:19:23.480 align:middle line:84%
was in Washington and
requested a car to investigate.

00:19:23.480 --> 00:19:25.480 align:middle line:10%
He waited for several hours.

00:19:25.480 --> 00:19:27.970 align:middle line:84%
The car was denied,
and he, therefore,

00:19:27.970 --> 00:19:31.720 align:middle line:84%
decided to return to his base
in Ohio Wright-Patterson.

00:19:31.720 --> 00:19:35.170 align:middle line:84%
However, before leaving he
spoke with an Air Force radar

00:19:35.170 --> 00:19:38.710 align:middle line:84%
specialist, Captain
Roy James, who

00:19:38.710 --> 00:19:41.860 align:middle line:84%
conceded that certain unusual
weather conditions could

00:19:41.860 --> 00:19:46.510 align:middle line:84%
have caused such objects
to appear on radar screens.

00:19:46.510 --> 00:19:50.880 align:middle line:84%
It is surprising that almost
70 years later explanations

00:19:50.880 --> 00:19:52.660 align:middle line:90%
are alike.

00:19:52.660 --> 00:19:56.710 align:middle line:84%
In 1952, it was
a climatic event.

00:19:56.710 --> 00:20:00.940 align:middle line:84%
In 2019, it was a flock
of birds that no one saw.

00:20:00.940 --> 00:20:04.210 align:middle line:10%
However, it is more surprising
that between 3:00 and 4:00

00:20:04.210 --> 00:20:06.700 align:middle line:10%
in the morning a
large object was video

00:20:06.700 --> 00:20:11.500 align:middle line:10%
recorded directly on the
Pentagon at very low altitude

00:20:11.500 --> 00:20:15.970 align:middle line:10%
by four different witnesses,
and that in that occasion

00:20:15.970 --> 00:20:19.820 align:middle line:10%
no security measure
had been taken.

00:20:19.820 --> 00:20:23.740 align:middle line:10%
It is very hard to believe
that it was not detected.

00:20:23.740 --> 00:20:28.660 align:middle line:84%
Surely that information is
now a national security issue.

00:20:28.660 --> 00:20:31.000 align:middle line:84%
A confrontation
with such an object

00:20:31.000 --> 00:20:33.460 align:middle line:90%
could have generated a reaction.

00:20:33.460 --> 00:20:37.480 align:middle line:84%
The combat jets could have been
shut down, and without a doubt,

00:20:37.480 --> 00:20:39.610 align:middle line:84%
as if it were a
movie, a direct war

00:20:39.610 --> 00:20:42.520 align:middle line:84%
had been launched at
once against the forces

00:20:42.520 --> 00:20:45.760 align:middle line:84%
that they would have been
considered as invasive.

00:20:45.760 --> 00:20:51.160 align:middle line:90%


00:20:51.160 --> 00:20:55.340 align:middle line:84%
>> The great giant of Washington
showed up the same night that

00:20:55.340 --> 00:21:00.170 align:middle line:84%
the United States Air Force
Space Combat Command Project

00:21:00.170 --> 00:21:01.940 align:middle line:90%
was declared official.

00:21:01.940 --> 00:21:06.890 align:middle line:84%
This November 26 probably it
was a new warning that we cannot

00:21:06.890 --> 00:21:09.520 align:middle line:90%
use the space to make war.

00:21:09.520 --> 00:21:12.500 align:middle line:84%
First, in December,
they presented us

00:21:12.500 --> 00:21:13.940 align:middle line:90%
with a huge object.

00:21:13.940 --> 00:21:16.430 align:middle line:84%
Then the second
time in November,

00:21:16.430 --> 00:21:19.910 align:middle line:84%
an invisible one appeared,
proving that they are so far

00:21:19.910 --> 00:21:23.150 align:middle line:84%
advanced that we
cannot match them.

00:21:23.150 --> 00:21:24.860 align:middle line:90%
The air belongs to us.

00:21:24.860 --> 00:21:28.940 align:middle line:84%
But outer space belongs to
all the intelligent creatures

00:21:28.940 --> 00:21:30.730 align:middle line:90%
of the universe.

00:21:30.730 --> 00:21:34.300 align:middle line:84%
Just think about
that for a moment.

00:21:34.300 --> 00:21:38.470 align:middle line:84%
I am Jaime MaussÃ¡n and I wait
for you in the next episode

00:21:38.470 --> 00:21:39.370 align:middle line:90%
of "Nuevo".
