my life, my work.

00:10:14.770 --> 00:10:17.460 align:middle line:84%
The robot kept moving

00:10:17.460 --> 00:10:19.755 align:middle line:84%
It passed over the
roof of all the houses.

00:10:19.755 --> 00:10:23.340 align:middle line:90%


00:10:23.340 --> 00:10:26.710 align:middle line:90%
It turns and it looks at me.

00:10:26.710 --> 00:10:30.990 align:middle line:84%
I called Simona, because I
wanted her to come and see it.

00:10:30.990 --> 00:10:34.080 align:middle line:90%
After that, another event--

00:10:34.080 --> 00:10:38.760 align:middle line:84%
an orange light that rose above
the cars, over the traffic

00:10:38.760 --> 00:10:42.210 align:middle line:90%
lights and even us.

00:10:42.210 --> 00:10:45.620 align:middle line:84%
We have the testimony
of Gloria, also Luca.

00:10:45.620 --> 00:10:50.550 align:middle line:84%
They remembered that well and
said, incredible, how big.

00:10:50.550 --> 00:10:52.110 align:middle line:90%
But it's not normal.

00:10:52.110 --> 00:10:55.620 align:middle line:90%
How can you tell that to people?

00:10:55.620 --> 00:10:58.110 align:middle line:84%
But now I can say it, because
we have a lot of material

00:10:58.110 --> 00:11:01.650 align:middle line:90%
from that part of my life.

00:11:01.650 --> 00:11:04.170 align:middle line:84%
And I think it's time to
talk, because I'm not alone

00:11:04.170 --> 00:11:06.840 align:middle line:90%
recording those phenomena.

00:11:06.840 --> 00:11:11.490 align:middle line:84%
Many people in the world
also have these experiences.

00:11:11.490 --> 00:11:18.060 align:middle line:84%
And this is a way to give
them strength, courage

00:11:18.060 --> 00:11:19.440 align:middle line:90%
to even speak without fear.

00:11:19.440 --> 00:11:22.160 align:middle line:90%


00:11:22.160 --> 00:11:26.120 align:middle line:84%
>> Continuing with the
experience of May 8, 2005,

00:11:26.120 --> 00:11:30.500 align:middle line:84%
Antonio would record an energy
object at a low altitude.

00:11:30.500 --> 00:11:33.170 align:middle line:10%
In the image, recorded
during the night,

00:11:33.170 --> 00:11:35.870 align:middle line:10%
we can see a ship with
the characteristic shape

00:11:35.870 --> 00:11:41.600 align:middle line:10%
of the so-called flying saucers,
which displays immense energy.

00:11:41.600 --> 00:11:45.920 align:middle line:84%
Nevertheless, you can see the
configuration of the object.

00:11:45.920 --> 00:11:47.960 align:middle line:84%
More than 30 minutes
later, the ship

00:11:47.960 --> 00:11:51.940 align:middle line:90%
moved away until it disappeared.

00:11:51.940 --> 00:11:55.000 align:middle line:84%
Simona Sibila has
shared these experiences

00:11:55.000 --> 00:12:01.090 align:middle line:84%
with Antonio Urzi since the
first months of the year 2000.

00:12:01.090 --> 00:12:05.370 align:middle line:90%
>> [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

00:12:05.370 --> 00:12:09.120 align:middle line:84%
>> The first time I saw a ship
with Antonio was in Portofino.

00:12:09.120 --> 00:12:10.575 align:middle line:90%
And I started shouting.

00:12:10.575 --> 00:12:14.310 align:middle line:90%


00:12:14.310 --> 00:12:17.580 align:middle line:84%
I was in the car and
screaming like crazy.

00:12:17.580 --> 00:12:19.680 align:middle line:84%
I bent down, because
I was terrified.

00:12:19.680 --> 00:12:23.380 align:middle line:90%


00:12:23.380 --> 00:12:27.060 align:middle line:84%
But now when I see a UFO,
it's already a regular thing

00:12:27.060 --> 00:12:28.125 align:middle line:90%
that's part of my life.

00:12:28.125 --> 00:12:30.940 align:middle line:90%


00:12:30.940 --> 00:12:33.375 align:middle line:84%
And at that moment,
I feel happy.

00:12:33.375 --> 00:12:36.360 align:middle line:90%


00:12:36.360 --> 00:12:37.950 align:middle line:90%
Sometimes I'm a little nervous.

00:12:37.950 --> 00:12:39.735 align:middle line:90%
But Antonio is more in control.

00:12:39.735 --> 00:12:43.050 align:middle line:90%


00:12:43.050 --> 00:12:47.550 align:middle line:84%
I think it's even
more natural for him,

00:12:47.550 --> 00:12:51.450 align:middle line:84%
because I see him happy from the
moment he wakes in the morning.

00:12:51.450 --> 00:12:54.600 align:middle line:90%

>> [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

00:13:05.150 --> 00:13:08.580 align:middle line:84%
>> Yes, there have been many
sightings with Antonio during

00:13:08.580 --> 00:13:11.790 align:middle line:84%
the 18 years that
we've been together.

00:13:11.790 --> 00:13:17.430 align:middle line:84%
Since 2003, we began to
have those experiences.

00:13:17.430 --> 00:13:22.095 align:middle line:84%
We saw many ships of different
shapes and a variety of colors.

00:13:22.095 --> 00:13:25.260 align:middle line:90%


00:13:25.260 --> 00:13:27.720 align:middle line:90%
But lately it's less frequent.

00:13:27.720 --> 00:13:32.300 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't happen every
day as it did before.

00:13:32.300 --> 00:13:34.860 align:middle line:84%
In comparison, these
experiences have

00:13:34.860 --> 00:13:37.320 align:middle line:84%
diminished, especially
the large ships

00:13:37.320 --> 00:13:38.455 align:middle line:90%
that Antonio has recorded.

00:13:38.455 --> 00:13:41.340 align:middle line:90%


00:13:41.340 --> 00:13:43.665 align:middle line:84%
Now when they appear,
they're much smaller.

>> [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

00:14:06.030 --> 00:14:07.320 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes, of course.

00:14:07.320 --> 00:14:10.510 align:middle line:84%
The first year when we started
having those experiences,

00:14:10.510 --> 00:14:14.220 align:middle line:90%
we didn't have a video camera.

00:14:14.220 --> 00:14:17.640 align:middle line:84%
And we didn't think about
telling anyone what we saw,

00:14:17.640 --> 00:14:19.800 align:middle line:84%
because it was something
just between us,

00:14:19.800 --> 00:14:23.160 align:middle line:84%
a private experience that we
wouldn't share with anyone.

00:14:23.160 --> 00:14:25.980 align:middle line:90%


00:14:25.980 --> 00:14:28.080 align:middle line:84%
But when Antonio
got the cameras,

00:14:28.080 --> 00:14:32.670 align:middle line:84%
he started videotaping the ships
almost every day, close up,

00:14:32.670 --> 00:14:36.210 align:middle line:84%
from a distance, and
also the gray beings

00:14:36.210 --> 00:14:38.310 align:middle line:84%
when they appeared and
disappeared in the house.

00:14:38.310 --> 00:14:41.010 align:middle line:90%


00:14:41.010 --> 00:14:43.770 align:middle line:84%
I can assure you that
Antonio recorded a lot,

00:14:43.770 --> 00:14:49.350 align:middle line:84%
without exaggerating, for
six or seven times a day,

00:14:49.350 --> 00:14:52.950 align:middle line:84%
always capturing an image of
things that were not normal

00:14:52.950 --> 00:14:56.820 align:middle line:90%
as seen in the previous video.

00:14:56.820 --> 00:14:57.645 align:middle line:90%
That is our story.

>> Of course.

00:15:13.860 --> 00:15:17.370 align:middle line:84%
Most people go to bed at
11:00 or 12:00 at night.

00:15:17.370 --> 00:15:20.280 align:middle line:84%
When I woke up at 4:00
or 5:00 in the morning,

00:15:20.280 --> 00:15:23.130 align:middle line:90%
Antonio was not in bed.

00:15:23.130 --> 00:15:26.040 align:middle line:84%
He was in the window
of the bathroom

00:15:26.040 --> 00:15:28.170 align:middle line:84%
or the one near
the bed, observing

00:15:28.170 --> 00:15:31.950 align:middle line:90%
the sky, totally obsessed.

00:15:31.950 --> 00:15:36.090 align:middle line:84%
On one occasion in summer,
it was so hot, I got up.

00:15:36.090 --> 00:15:38.490 align:middle line:90%
And Antonio was not in bed.

00:15:38.490 --> 00:15:41.340 align:middle line:84%
I found him in the
window with the camera,

00:15:41.340 --> 00:15:47.300 align:middle line:84%
recording a large number of
UFOs of all types and sizes.

00:15:47.300 --> 00:15:49.048 align:middle line:90%
It was something incredible.

00:15:49.048 --> 00:15:50.715 align:middle line:84%
And it was already
10:00 in the morning.

00:15:50.715 --> 00:15:54.130 align:middle line:90%


00:15:54.130 --> 00:15:57.630 align:middle line:84%
It's one of the first episodes
that I remember the most,

00:15:57.630 --> 00:16:00.810 align:middle line:84%
because Antonio
almost passed out.

00:16:00.810 --> 00:16:02.340 align:middle line:90%
He had an attack.

00:16:02.340 --> 00:16:04.400 align:middle line:90%
He had a tachycardia.

00:16:04.400 --> 00:16:08.820 align:middle line:84%
So I took him to bed and told
him, now you're going to sleep,

00:16:08.820 --> 00:16:10.680 align:middle line:90%
because you're not well.

00:16:10.680 --> 00:16:12.660 align:middle line:84%
It really is an
obsession for him.

00:16:12.660 --> 00:16:16.560 align:middle line:90%


00:16:16.560 --> 00:16:21.280 align:middle line:84%

life is filming those ships.

As I mentioned to you, for
us, it was a natural thing.

00:16:36.870 --> 00:16:40.440 align:middle line:10%
Antonio filming those
ships was like having

00:16:40.440 --> 00:16:42.090 align:middle line:10%
coffee in the morning.

00:16:42.090 --> 00:16:46.500 align:middle line:10%
And he drank several
because he needed them.

00:16:46.500 --> 00:16:50.250 align:middle line:84%
Lately, the recordings
have decreased.

00:16:50.250 --> 00:16:53.130 align:middle line:84%
He used to spend a good
part of the night filming

00:16:53.130 --> 00:16:56.160 align:middle line:90%
with his camera.

00:16:56.160 --> 00:17:00.860 align:middle line:84%
And then in the day,
he continued filming--

00:17:00.860 --> 00:17:03.169 align:middle line:90%
filming and filming.

"Granny's Video"

00:18:19.060 --> 00:18:24.400 align:middle line:84%
he called me immediately,
"Simona, Simona."

00:18:24.400 --> 00:18:27.490 align:middle line:84%
When I heard it, I
was scared because I

00:18:27.490 --> 00:18:29.830 align:middle line:90%
didn't know what was happening.

00:18:29.830 --> 00:18:34.520 align:middle line:84%
Then, I saw that big
and awesome object.

And he told me to call my
grandmother at the same time

00:18:38.230 --> 00:18:39.940 align:middle line:90%
he was cursing.

00:18:39.940 --> 00:18:42.520 align:middle line:84%
And I told him, don't
say those things.

00:18:42.520 --> 00:18:46.450 align:middle line:84%
But he insisted that
I call my grandmother.

00:18:46.450 --> 00:18:47.890 align:middle line:90%
I was standing beside him.

00:18:47.890 --> 00:18:50.950 align:middle line:84%
And the UFO was
moving very fast.

00:18:50.950 --> 00:18:53.470 align:middle line:90%
So Antonio told me to run.

00:18:53.470 --> 00:18:59.470 align:middle line:84%
So I put on a robe and left
quickly to go for Granny.

00:18:59.470 --> 00:19:03.160 align:middle line:84%
Luckily, I was able to
bring her to see the UFO.

00:19:03.160 --> 00:19:05.290 align:middle line:90%
Suddenly, that ship disappeared.

00:19:05.290 --> 00:19:07.720 align:middle line:90%
But there were many other UFOs.

00:19:07.720 --> 00:19:10.600 align:middle line:84%
It really was an

laughing that we

call that video the

That video has no additions.

00:19:18.250 --> 00:19:20.860 align:middle line:84%
And we can clearly
hear what Antonio says.

00:19:20.860 --> 00:19:22.930 align:middle line:90%
"Simona, look at this UFO.

00:19:22.930 --> 00:19:26.800 align:middle line:84%
Quickly, run and
bring Grandmother."

You know that I've
deleted a lot of videos

And I was hoping to
get better images.

00:22:09.110 --> 00:22:10.910 align:middle line:84%
So, I could not
keep many pictures

00:22:10.910 --> 00:22:12.770 align:middle line:84%

the same cassettes

on December 24, 2008, with
considerable reflection

00:30:51.720 --> 00:30:57.100 align:middle line:84%

and, therefore,

00:30:57.100 --> 00:31:01.300 align:middle line:84%
have anomalies in
the bright spots.

00:31:01.300 --> 00:31:04.045 align:middle line:84%

By analyzing the
image of Urzi's video,

00:31:14.810 --> 00:31:20.750 align:middle line:84%
we can see the buildings and
that the object interacts

00:31:20.750 --> 00:31:27.530 align:middle line:84%
with sunlight, thus creating
the same anomalies that

00:31:27.530 --> 00:31:30.740 align:middle line:84%
are identical to those caused
by the discoidal object.

00:31:37.540 --> 00:31:42.100 align:middle line:84%
If we filter the object,
it is possible to notice

00:31:42.100 --> 00:31:45.640 align:middle line:84%
with the effect of the
edge utilizing the filters,

00:31:45.640 --> 00:31:49.930 align:middle line:84%
which we do not see
in the video and which

00:31:49.930 --> 00:31:52.960 align:middle line:84%
are the reflections at the
same distance between them.

00:31:58.720 --> 00:32:04.270 align:middle line:84%

any thread, as some have said,

00:32:10.540 --> 00:32:14.875 align:middle line:84%
It also checks that the object
is large and very bulky.

00:32:18.460 --> 00:32:24.080 align:middle line:84%
Here, we also apply
several filters.

00:32:24.080 --> 00:32:25.750 align:middle line:90%
And no anomalies are visible.

00:32:30.040 --> 00:32:32.090 align:middle line:90%
These are simple reflections.

00:32:32.090 --> 00:32:33.880 align:middle line:84%
And there is nothing
artificial that has

00:32:33.880 --> 00:32:35.580 align:middle line:90%
been created by human hands.

00:32:41.380 --> 00:32:46.450 align:middle line:84%
Here we can see this
is very noticeable.

00:32:46.450 --> 00:32:50.710 align:middle line:84%
Someone smart has taken a
picture of Antonio's video

00:32:50.710 --> 00:32:51.775 align:middle line:90%
and added some threads.

00:32:54.800 --> 00:32:58.355 align:middle line:84%

00:33:01.660 --> 00:33:06.280 align:middle line:84%
And it proves that the
object has been altered.

00:33:10.360 --> 00:33:14.080 align:middle line:84%
We can see it with
the mapping of pixels,

which is modified here.

00:33:16.710 --> 00:33:20.400 align:middle line:84%
And therefore, the pixel
structure has lost definition.

show any alteration.

00:33:37.900 --> 00:33:40.090 align:middle line:90%

on YouTube of the images
published by Antonio.

00:34:19.199 --> 00:34:25.270 align:middle line:84%
Utilizing software, he
applied some threads awkwardly

00:34:25.270 --> 00:34:29.760 align:middle line:84%
to simulate that they are
those of a fishing rod

00:34:29.760 --> 00:34:34.840 align:middle line:84%
and that those threads support
the supposedly false object.

00:34:34.840 --> 00:34:38.560 align:middle line:84%
Then, when analyzing the
image, we immediately

00:34:38.560 --> 00:34:42.639 align:middle line:84%
notice that the
definition is lost

00:34:42.639 --> 00:34:45.130 align:middle line:90%
because it is not the original.

00:34:45.130 --> 00:34:47.350 align:middle line:84%
When an image is
loaded on YouTube,

00:34:47.350 --> 00:34:51.805 align:middle line:84%
it is compressed and
then loses its quality.

00:34:51.805 --> 00:34:55.760 align:middle line:84%
In the example of this

alleging that it is deceitful.

00:35:00.310 --> 00:35:05.140 align:middle line:84%
However, this is not the case,
because comparing the image

00:35:05.140 --> 00:35:08.920 align:middle line:84%
with the original, we have
the absolute certainty

00:35:08.920 --> 00:35:11.230 align:middle line:84%

been manipulation,
