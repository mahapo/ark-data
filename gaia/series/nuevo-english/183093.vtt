by the Russian scientists,

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:51.920 align:middle line:10%
to be 20 to 25
kilometers in size.

Previous to that incident,
the Phobos 2 probe

00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:59.510 align:middle line:84%
had taken pictures of Mars

had appeared.

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:28.700 align:middle line:84%

This report was
featured and shown

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:39.440 align:middle line:84%
on Soviet television, a
very mysterious occurrence.

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:42.620 align:middle line:10%
More than 25 years ago, we
conducted an investigation

00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:44.720 align:middle line:10%
into this extraordinary case.

00:01:44.720 --> 00:01:47.540 align:middle line:10%
And were even able to find
the original report that

00:01:47.540 --> 00:01:49.880 align:middle line:10%
was shown on Soviet television.

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:52.220 align:middle line:84%
This was a very
important achievement

00:01:52.220 --> 00:01:55.460 align:middle line:84%
considering the censorship that
existed in the Soviet Union

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:57.980 align:middle line:84%
before the fall of
the Iron Curtain.

00:01:57.980 --> 00:02:00.275 align:middle line:84%
Here are details from
that original report.

00:02:00.275 --> 00:02:03.260 align:middle line:90%


00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:06.830 align:middle line:10%
On March 27, 1989,
flight controllers

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:11.660 align:middle line:10%
lost contact with the small
probe located more than 180

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:13.910 align:middle line:10%
million kilometers from Earth.

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:18.230 align:middle line:10%
Phobos 2 was in orbit around
Mars when it disappeared.

00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:20.300 align:middle line:84%
According to the
official story, the probe

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:24.170 align:middle line:84%
became lost when turning to
photograph the Phobos moon.

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:28.790 align:middle line:84%
Apparently, it could not
reorient itself, and vanished.

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:31.610 align:middle line:84%
For the controllers at the Space
Center in the former Soviet

00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:36.440 align:middle line:84%
Union, it was incomprehensible
that Phobos was missing.

00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:38.720 align:middle line:84%
After orbiting
Mars several times

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:41.210 align:middle line:84%
and obtaining some of the
best photographs ever taken

00:02:41.210 --> 00:02:44.150 align:middle line:84%
of the Red Planet,
it had unaccountably,

00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:46.070 align:middle line:90%
stopped transmitting.

00:02:46.070 --> 00:02:49.970 align:middle line:84%
This multinational project had
been seriously compromised.

00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:51.830 align:middle line:84%
And the disappearance
of the probe

00:02:51.830 --> 00:02:54.500 align:middle line:84%
was an embarrassment
to the Soviets.

00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:56.690 align:middle line:84%
The world would
question the capability

00:02:56.690 --> 00:03:00.380 align:middle line:84%
of the Soviet scientists because
of the inexplicable omission

00:03:00.380 --> 00:03:01.590 align:middle line:90%
failure.

00:03:01.590 --> 00:03:04.190 align:middle line:84%
Especially after the
mysterious photographs

00:03:04.190 --> 00:03:06.590 align:middle line:90%
had been viewed by the world.

00:03:06.590 --> 00:03:08.930 align:middle line:10%
These photographs
showed a huge shadow

00:03:08.930 --> 00:03:12.860 align:middle line:10%
projected onto the Martian
surface, a shadow of 27

00:03:12.860 --> 00:03:14.880 align:middle line:10%
or 28 kilometers.

00:03:14.880 --> 00:03:18.530 align:middle line:10%
It was as if a very large
object behind the probe--

00:03:18.530 --> 00:03:20.750 align:middle line:10%
that is, between the
probe and the sun--

00:03:20.750 --> 00:03:23.060 align:middle line:10%
had projected this
mysterious shadow

00:03:23.060 --> 00:03:25.250 align:middle line:10%
onto the surface of Mars.

00:03:25.250 --> 00:03:27.320 align:middle line:84%
The shadow had been
photographed twice

00:03:27.320 --> 00:03:29.510 align:middle line:84%
by the two available
cameras on the ship that

00:03:29.510 --> 00:03:32.840 align:middle line:84%
were equipped with infrared
spectrum and normal spectrum

00:03:32.840 --> 00:03:34.220 align:middle line:90%
systems.

00:03:34.220 --> 00:03:36.470 align:middle line:84%
Each camera was programmed
to take pictures

00:03:36.470 --> 00:03:38.210 align:middle line:90%
every eight hours.

00:03:38.210 --> 00:03:40.880 align:middle line:10%
After taking the last
picture of Phobos,

00:03:40.880 --> 00:03:43.100 align:middle line:10%
an elliptical
object was detected

00:03:43.100 --> 00:03:47.480 align:middle line:10%
moving towards the satellite
probe seconds before it failed.

00:03:47.480 --> 00:03:49.790 align:middle line:84%
Indications were that
the elliptical object

00:03:49.790 --> 00:03:52.370 align:middle line:84%
had attacked the satellite,
which was now dead

00:03:52.370 --> 00:03:54.780 align:middle line:84%
and left spinning
out of control.

00:03:54.780 --> 00:03:57.980 align:middle line:84%
The Phobos 2 probe
simply disappeared.

00:04:04.400 --> 00:04:06.740 align:middle line:10%
>> We have some extraordinary
news tonight that has been

00:04:06.740 --> 00:04:09.980 align:middle line:10%
the subject of a lot of
talk from Western reporters.

00:04:09.980 --> 00:04:12.080 align:middle line:10%
The interplanetary
station Phobos

00:04:12.080 --> 00:04:15.170 align:middle line:10%
1, the satellite that
has been orbiting Mars,

00:04:15.170 --> 00:04:16.990 align:middle line:10%
has suffered a catastrophe.

00:04:16.990 --> 00:04:19.880 align:middle line:10%
And the international
program between 14 countries

00:04:19.880 --> 00:04:21.779 align:middle line:10%
has been compromised.

00:04:21.779 --> 00:04:23.300 align:middle line:10%
Now let's look at the facts.

00:04:23.300 --> 00:04:26.340 align:middle line:10%
The Phobos program
consisted of three parts.

00:04:26.340 --> 00:04:29.330 align:middle line:10%
The first was the initial
flight of the spacecraft

00:04:29.330 --> 00:04:32.360 align:middle line:10%
that blasted off from
Earth on its way to Mars.

00:04:32.360 --> 00:04:36.200 align:middle line:10%
And during that voyage,
solar wind would be studied.

00:04:36.200 --> 00:04:39.710 align:middle line:10%
The second stage was the
study and exploration of Mars

00:04:39.710 --> 00:04:41.930 align:middle line:10%
from the spacecraft.

00:04:41.930 --> 00:04:44.360 align:middle line:10%
Now, here is a beautiful
detailed photograph

00:04:44.360 --> 00:04:46.940 align:middle line:10%
that was taken by the
Soviet spacecraft.

00:04:46.940 --> 00:04:49.130 align:middle line:84%
Images that have
never before been seen

00:04:49.130 --> 00:04:51.890 align:middle line:90%
by any person or scientist.

00:04:51.890 --> 00:04:53.540 align:middle line:84%
So the third story
here to consider

00:04:53.540 --> 00:04:57.020 align:middle line:84%
was the loss of the
spacecraft, Phobos 1.

00:04:57.020 --> 00:05:00.950 align:middle line:10%
We have now received news that
after the photographic images

00:05:00.950 --> 00:05:05.450 align:middle line:10%
were taken, Phobos 1 veered
off its projected track.

00:05:05.450 --> 00:05:08.330 align:middle line:10%
And the link to the controllers
at the Soviet Space Command

00:05:08.330 --> 00:05:09.680 align:middle line:10%
was lost.

00:05:09.680 --> 00:05:12.320 align:middle line:10%
Today, we happened to
be filming in the Flight

00:05:12.320 --> 00:05:14.090 align:middle line:10%
Center on a
different assignment,

00:05:14.090 --> 00:05:16.340 align:middle line:10%
and we were able
to film firsthand,

00:05:16.340 --> 00:05:19.070 align:middle line:10%
scientists trying to
communicate with Phobos 1

00:05:19.070 --> 00:05:21.680 align:middle line:10%
and bring it back to life.

00:05:21.680 --> 00:05:23.150 align:middle line:10%
Now we'd like to
show you the film

00:05:23.150 --> 00:05:24.800 align:middle line:10%
that many Soviet
research centers

00:05:24.800 --> 00:05:26.000 align:middle line:10%
are trying to understand.

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:26.990 align:middle line:10%
This is it.

00:05:26.990 --> 00:05:31.260 align:middle line:10%
What you're seeing here is a
shot of the surface of Mars.

00:05:31.260 --> 00:05:34.160 align:middle line:10%
This is a beautiful
image from a thermal map.

00:05:34.160 --> 00:05:36.380 align:middle line:10%
And here's a line almost
20 kilometers long,

00:05:36.380 --> 00:05:38.660 align:middle line:10%
that was unexpectedly
discovered.

00:05:38.660 --> 00:05:40.780 align:middle line:10%
It can be seen in
this area here,

00:05:40.780 --> 00:05:43.040 align:middle line:10%
that's visible to the naked eye.

00:05:43.040 --> 00:05:47.300 align:middle line:10%
The line ends in this
inexplicable formation.

00:05:47.300 --> 00:05:51.260 align:middle line:10%
Now, here's what the specialists
are saying about this story

00:05:51.260 --> 00:05:53.690 align:middle line:10%
as it unfolds.

00:05:53.690 --> 00:05:56.190 align:middle line:10%
We've asked ourselves
what areas of the planet

00:05:56.190 --> 00:05:58.520 align:middle line:10%
they saw in the photographs
that were received.

00:05:58.520 --> 00:06:01.850 align:middle line:10%
Were they infrared
or visible areas?

00:06:01.850 --> 00:06:04.400 align:middle line:10%
Some maps of Mars already
exist-- like this Mars atlas

00:06:04.400 --> 00:06:05.200 align:middle line:10%
map.

00:06:05.200 --> 00:06:07.490 align:middle line:10%
And on this map,
it's possible to see

00:06:07.490 --> 00:06:09.680 align:middle line:10%
with areas Phobos photographed.

00:06:09.680 --> 00:06:12.790 align:middle line:10%
>> This first series
is the closest one.

00:06:12.790 --> 00:06:15.830 align:middle line:10%
Here, we obtained the
most detailed images

00:06:15.830 --> 00:06:18.350 align:middle line:10%
that helped us create this map.

00:06:18.350 --> 00:06:21.420 align:middle line:10%
Here, other colors
are displayed.

00:06:21.420 --> 00:06:24.380 align:middle line:84%
There are three other series
of images that were recently

00:06:24.380 --> 00:06:27.050 align:middle line:90%
taken of the surface of Mars.

00:06:27.050 --> 00:06:31.730 align:middle line:10%
>> This red color on the map,
is this just a coincidence?

00:06:31.730 --> 00:06:33.680 align:middle line:10%
>> Yes, it's coincidental.

00:06:33.680 --> 00:06:35.900 align:middle line:10%
Red Planet, red map.

00:06:35.900 --> 00:06:38.780 align:middle line:10%
The photograph for this
map was taken several days

00:06:38.780 --> 00:06:43.590 align:middle line:10%
before the unexplained lost
spacecraft situation happened.

00:06:43.590 --> 00:06:46.820 align:middle line:10%
>> But even if the people who
designed and constructed Phobos

00:06:46.820 --> 00:06:50.090 align:middle line:10%
1 explained what happened, is
it possible to say that they

00:06:50.090 --> 00:06:53.460 align:middle line:10%
received inexplicable
results, but at the same time,

00:06:53.460 --> 00:06:55.490 align:middle line:10%
new and incredible information?

00:06:55.490 --> 00:06:59.220 align:middle line:10%
>> Yes, what you're talking
about is visible in the shot.

00:06:59.220 --> 00:07:01.880 align:middle line:10%
However, we believe
an optical phenomenon

00:07:01.880 --> 00:07:04.290 align:middle line:10%
like this is not
yet explainable.

00:07:04.290 --> 00:07:06.110 align:middle line:10%
>> So what part of
the planet is this?

00:07:06.110 --> 00:07:08.930 align:middle line:84%
Is this what we're
talking about?

00:07:08.930 --> 00:07:11.150 align:middle line:10%
>> Well, here in this place--

00:07:11.150 --> 00:07:12.470 align:middle line:10%
as you can see--

00:07:12.470 --> 00:07:16.880 align:middle line:10%
in this area on the map and
here, starting about here

00:07:16.880 --> 00:07:19.780 align:middle line:10%
and ending over here,
this strip measure

00:07:19.780 --> 00:07:23.750 align:middle line:10%
is somewhere between
20 and 25 kilometers.

00:07:23.750 --> 00:07:28.460 align:middle line:10%
And is visible in the
optical and infrared zone.

00:07:28.460 --> 00:07:31.250 align:middle line:10%
The satellite shots
were taken the same day,

00:07:31.250 --> 00:07:34.200 align:middle line:10%
but every eight
hours, twice a day,

00:07:34.200 --> 00:07:36.950 align:middle line:10%
eight hours apart-- you see.

00:07:36.950 --> 00:07:41.530 align:middle line:10%
In addition, here and right
here, this strip is visible.

00:07:41.530 --> 00:07:43.640 align:middle line:10%
There's also another
shape in some

00:07:43.640 --> 00:07:47.690 align:middle line:10%
of these photographs, a shape
that is quite easy to see,

00:07:47.690 --> 00:07:51.890 align:middle line:10%
measuring between 26
and 30 kilometers.

00:07:51.890 --> 00:07:55.190 align:middle line:10%
It's a shadow or
shape of some kind,

00:07:55.190 --> 00:07:57.710 align:middle line:10%
but it differs from this strip.

00:07:57.710 --> 00:08:00.620 align:middle line:10%
It's shorter, a little narrower.

00:08:00.620 --> 00:08:03.920 align:middle line:10%
And has a different shape,
which is visible only

00:08:03.920 --> 00:08:08.450 align:middle line:10%
in the two shots received in the
optical and infrared zone that

00:08:08.450 --> 00:08:13.280 align:middle line:10%
were taken at about
midnight, 12:00 AM

00:08:13.280 --> 00:08:15.500 align:middle line:10%
in the morning-- you see.

00:08:15.500 --> 00:08:18.350 align:middle line:10%
>> So the most important thing
is that in the previous maps,

00:08:18.350 --> 00:08:21.140 align:middle line:10%
these shapes or shadows
were not visible?

00:08:21.140 --> 00:08:22.070 align:middle line:10%
>> Correct.

00:08:22.070 --> 00:08:25.260 align:middle line:10%
No shapes are visible
on the screen.

00:08:25.260 --> 00:08:27.830 align:middle line:10%
>> Well, the shadow
appeared unexpectedly.

00:08:27.830 --> 00:08:29.610 align:middle line:10%
We didn't understand it.

00:08:29.610 --> 00:08:32.030 align:middle line:10%
And we didn't really pay
much attention to it.

00:08:32.030 --> 00:08:34.100 align:middle line:10%
Because it appears again later.

00:08:34.100 --> 00:08:37.710 align:middle line:10%
In the next series of shots,
it was even less visible.

00:08:37.710 --> 00:08:40.309 align:middle line:10%
But it was there, nonetheless.

00:08:40.309 --> 00:08:43.700 align:middle line:10%
In another area of the
shots it was also observed,

00:08:43.700 --> 00:08:46.050 align:middle line:10%
although to a lesser extent.

00:08:46.050 --> 00:08:49.730 align:middle line:10%
>> So it was a shadow on the
surface, rather than an object?

00:08:49.730 --> 00:08:50.780 align:middle line:10%
>> Probably.

00:08:50.780 --> 00:08:54.410 align:middle line:10%
Because this shadow, it
is not completely obscure

00:08:54.410 --> 00:08:57.710 align:middle line:10%
or cover this area or
the surface of Mars.

00:08:57.710 --> 00:09:01.790 align:middle line:10%
>> This looks like a remarkable
image that was taken when

00:09:01.790 --> 00:09:04.700 align:middle line:10%
the satellite passed
over Mars, correct?

00:09:04.700 --> 00:09:06.110 align:middle line:10%
What do you think about it?

00:09:06.110 --> 00:09:08.000 align:middle line:10%
>> Well, it is
quite fantastical,

00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:10.010 align:middle line:10%
but it could be possible.

00:09:10.010 --> 00:09:12.950 align:middle line:10%
We see it in a
coherent and real way.

00:09:12.950 --> 00:09:17.120 align:middle line:10%
Although whatever caused the
shadow is not easily explained.

00:09:17.120 --> 00:09:20.300 align:middle line:10%
It's more likely to be the
shadow of an object in the area

00:09:20.300 --> 00:09:23.850 align:middle line:10%
because the surface of the
shadows tail is translucent.

00:09:23.850 --> 00:09:25.310 align:middle line:10%
You can see through it.

00:09:25.310 --> 00:09:29.320 align:middle line:10%
Also, the concentration of
the image is hard to decipher.

00:09:29.320 --> 00:09:32.120 align:middle line:10%
What I'm saying is that
in order to understand it,

00:09:32.120 --> 00:09:36.800 align:middle line:10%
it will be necessary to carry
out scientific analysis.

00:09:36.800 --> 00:09:40.310 align:middle line:10%
This phenomenon or
unexplained singular image

00:09:40.310 --> 00:09:42.590 align:middle line:10%
is the same as what
you saw before.

00:09:42.590 --> 00:09:45.560 align:middle line:10%
But you have to be very
careful since any spectacle

00:09:45.560 --> 00:09:48.500 align:middle line:10%
of this type requires
deep analysis

00:09:48.500 --> 00:09:50.390 align:middle line:10%
and study by our scientists.

00:09:50.390 --> 00:09:54.230 align:middle line:10%
And only then, will it be
possible to better understand

00:09:54.230 --> 00:09:56.490 align:middle line:10%
what we are looking at here.

00:09:56.490 --> 00:09:57.890 align:middle line:90%
[PLAYBACK ENDS]

00:09:57.890 --> 00:10:01.040 align:middle line:84%
>> Concerning the disappearance
of the Phobos 2 probe,

00:10:01.040 --> 00:10:05.330 align:middle line:84%
they had no explanation for the
loss of control of the probe.

00:10:05.330 --> 00:10:09.260 align:middle line:84%
Soviet scientists would not
consider another possibility.

00:10:09.260 --> 00:10:12.980 align:middle line:84%
One that suggests that the probe
had been hijacked or destroyed

00:10:12.980 --> 00:10:16.130 align:middle line:84%
by intelligences
alien to our planet.

00:10:16.130 --> 00:10:18.980 align:middle line:84%
Consider the fact that many
nations had participated

00:10:18.980 --> 00:10:21.860 align:middle line:84%
economically in a project
that should have produced

00:10:21.860 --> 00:10:24.530 align:middle line:84%
a large amount of
data about Mars,

00:10:24.530 --> 00:10:27.095 align:middle line:84%
especially data about
the Martian moon Phobos.

00:10:27.095 --> 00:10:29.640 align:middle line:90%


00:10:29.640 --> 00:10:32.400 align:middle line:84%
In early research,
Phobos had attracted

00:10:32.400 --> 00:10:34.710 align:middle line:84%
the attention of
Soviet researchers,

00:10:34.710 --> 00:10:37.080 align:middle line:84%
especially of the
Cydonia region,

00:10:37.080 --> 00:10:40.590 align:middle line:84%
after carrying out
a mapping of Mars.

00:10:40.590 --> 00:10:42.900 align:middle line:84%
Phobos 2 should
have landed on Mars

00:10:42.900 --> 00:10:46.990 align:middle line:84%
to perform various analysis
of the strange planet.

00:10:46.990 --> 00:10:49.500 align:middle line:84%
However, only a few days
after entering orbit

00:10:49.500 --> 00:10:52.620 align:middle line:84%
around the planet,
the craft disappeared,

00:10:52.620 --> 00:10:57.180 align:middle line:84%
preventing the mission
from being carried out.

00:10:57.180 --> 00:11:02.310 align:middle line:84%
On March 27, 1989, it was
declared officially lost.

00:11:02.310 --> 00:11:04.140 align:middle line:90%
Something had happened to it.

00:11:04.140 --> 00:11:06.210 align:middle line:84%
Something very
strange had happened

00:11:06.210 --> 00:11:12.560 align:middle line:84%
to Phobos 2, more than 1,800,000
kilometers from the Earth.

00:11:12.560 --> 00:11:16.800 align:middle line:84%
Its twin, Phobos 1, was also
lost on its trip to Mars.

00:11:16.800 --> 00:11:21.660 align:middle line:84%
This had happened previously,
on September 1, 1988.

00:11:21.660 --> 00:11:24.960 align:middle line:84%
Apparently, due to a data
transmission failure,

00:11:24.960 --> 00:11:27.970 align:middle line:84%
the scientists had
sent it off route.

00:11:27.970 --> 00:11:29.340 align:middle line:90%
And it had been lost in space.

00:11:29.340 --> 00:11:36.053 align:middle line:90%

00:11:42.460 --> 00:11:46.870 align:middle line:84%
In 1991, the Russian
cosmonaut Marina Popovich

00:11:46.870 --> 00:11:49.330 align:middle line:84%
unveiled extraordinary
evidence that

00:11:49.330 --> 00:11:52.480 align:middle line:84%
could possibly explain the
disappearance of the space

00:11:52.480 --> 00:11:55.780 align:middle line:90%
probe Phobos 2.

00:11:55.780 --> 00:11:59.170 align:middle line:84%
The evidence was the last
photograph taken by the Phobos

00:11:59.170 --> 00:12:02.140 align:middle line:90%
2 probe before disappearing.

00:12:02.140 --> 00:12:05.290 align:middle line:84%
In the image, there
is an object measuring

00:12:05.290 --> 00:12:09.490 align:middle line:84%
approximately 25 kilometers
in length, floating in space

00:12:09.490 --> 00:12:12.310 align:middle line:90%
near the moon of Phobos.

00:12:12.310 --> 00:12:15.160 align:middle line:84%
After taking the picture
and examining it,

00:12:15.160 --> 00:12:18.850 align:middle line:84%
the object mysteriously
disappeared.

00:12:18.850 --> 00:12:21.520 align:middle line:84%
The strange events that
occurred on the Phobos mission

00:12:21.520 --> 00:12:24.760 align:middle line:84%
would remain unnoticed
by Western scientists,

00:12:24.760 --> 00:12:27.940 align:middle line:84%
until cosmonaut Marina
Popovich unveiled

00:12:27.940 --> 00:12:31.090 align:middle line:84%
the final photograph
obtained by Phobos 2

00:12:31.090 --> 00:12:34.700 align:middle line:84%
before its long
object disappeared.

00:12:34.700 --> 00:12:37.510 align:middle line:10%
An official photograph from
the Russian Space Agency

00:12:37.510 --> 00:12:41.870 align:middle line:10%
in early December of 1991
exposed the evidence,

00:12:41.870 --> 00:12:46.120 align:middle line:10%
which shows a large object,
almost 30 kilometers long,

00:12:46.120 --> 00:12:48.760 align:middle line:10%
very close to the
moon of Phobos.

00:12:48.760 --> 00:12:52.270 align:middle line:84%
Despite the weight of this
evidence, the public at large

00:12:52.270 --> 00:12:54.310 align:middle line:90%
was unaware of it.

00:12:54.310 --> 00:12:57.640 align:middle line:84%
Dr. James Harder, renowned
researcher from the United

00:12:57.640 --> 00:12:59.440 align:middle line:90%
States, explains what happened.

[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:13:00.850 --> 00:13:02.410 align:middle line:90%
>> I'm Dr. James Harder.

00:13:02.410 --> 00:13:05.410 align:middle line:10%
And I first saw this
picture last week,

00:13:05.410 --> 00:13:08.510 align:middle line:10%
when Marina showed
it to a conference.

00:13:08.510 --> 00:13:12.760 align:middle line:10%
And at a press conference
at the Soviet Embassy,

00:13:12.760 --> 00:13:14.800 align:middle line:10%
she released this
for the first time,

00:13:14.800 --> 00:13:16.690 align:middle line:10%
essentially, to the press.

00:13:16.690 --> 00:13:22.390 align:middle line:10%
It's the third picture taken
by the Martian probe Phobos 2.

00:13:22.390 --> 00:13:24.730 align:middle line:10%
This was the last picture taken.

00:13:24.730 --> 00:13:27.070 align:middle line:10%
There is an object
that appears to be

00:13:27.070 --> 00:13:29.290 align:middle line:10%
in the vicinity of
Phobos, but it could be,

00:13:29.290 --> 00:13:32.050 align:middle line:10%
of course, smaller
and much closer.

00:13:32.050 --> 00:13:34.870 align:middle line:10%
And the interesting thing
is that after having made it

00:13:34.870 --> 00:13:38.500 align:middle line:10%
through all of the high
G-Forces of launch,

00:13:38.500 --> 00:13:41.820 align:middle line:10%
having made it through a
year's worth of time and space,

00:13:41.820 --> 00:13:44.410 align:middle line:10%
that it should
suddenly disappear

00:13:44.410 --> 00:13:47.740 align:middle line:10%
or at least, disappear
from radio contact

00:13:47.740 --> 00:13:52.340 align:middle line:10%
after it took this rather
interesting photograph.

00:13:52.340 --> 00:13:54.230 align:middle line:10%
>> What it is for you?

00:13:54.230 --> 00:13:58.240 align:middle line:10%
>> Well, all we can say is
that it's an unknown object,

00:13:58.240 --> 00:14:01.550 align:middle line:10%
but it's very likely to be real.

00:14:01.550 --> 00:14:05.890 align:middle line:10%
I don't think you can exhaust
all of the other possibilities

00:14:05.890 --> 00:14:08.800 align:middle line:10%
that it's some
kind of a mistake,

00:14:08.800 --> 00:14:12.400 align:middle line:10%
or if it's some kind
of transmission error,

00:14:12.400 --> 00:14:14.040 align:middle line:10%
or if it's a hoax.

00:14:14.040 --> 00:14:15.100 align:middle line:10%
None of those things.

00:14:15.100 --> 00:14:18.400 align:middle line:10%
>> Do know that there are other
pictures of Mars where you can

00:14:18.400 --> 00:14:22.603 align:middle line:10%
see a very long shadow, a shadow
of probably 20 kilometers long?

00:14:22.603 --> 00:14:23.770 align:middle line:10%
>> I've heard of the shadow.

00:14:23.770 --> 00:14:25.420 align:middle line:10%
I've not seen it.

00:14:25.420 --> 00:14:28.150 align:middle line:10%
But of course,
from what you say,

00:14:28.150 --> 00:14:30.820 align:middle line:10%
this object could have
left that kind of a shadow.

00:14:30.820 --> 00:14:33.970 align:middle line:90%


00:14:33.970 --> 00:14:36.930 align:middle line:10%
The length of this
object, if it's

00:14:36.930 --> 00:14:43.090 align:middle line:10%
at the same distance as Phobos,
would be about 15 miles.

00:14:43.090 --> 00:14:46.810 align:middle line:90%


00:14:46.810 --> 00:14:51.310 align:middle line:10%
So I think, it's a
rather simple picture,

00:14:51.310 --> 00:14:53.260 align:middle line:10%
but it doesn't
have an explanation

00:14:53.260 --> 00:14:56.200 align:middle line:10%
of any natural sort.

00:14:56.200 --> 00:14:57.620 align:middle line:10%
>> It's very important.

00:14:57.620 --> 00:15:01.220 align:middle line:10%
>> I think it's important
because if it's not a hoax,

00:15:01.220 --> 00:15:03.790 align:middle line:10%
and I don't think it is a
hoax because it came from

00:15:03.790 --> 00:15:07.690 align:middle line:10%
the highest people in the
Soviet Space Agency who gave it

00:15:07.690 --> 00:15:09.193 align:middle line:10%
to Marina.

00:15:09.193 --> 00:15:10.610 align:middle line:10%
It doesn't look
like it's anything

00:15:10.610 --> 00:15:12.550 align:middle line:10%
that could be a transmission
error or an error

00:15:12.550 --> 00:15:15.090 align:middle line:10%
in the photographic technique.

00:15:15.090 --> 00:15:18.170 align:middle line:10%
And if it's not a hoax
and it's not a mistake,

00:15:18.170 --> 00:15:20.190 align:middle line:10%
it's definitely unknown.

00:15:20.190 --> 00:15:21.828 align:middle line:10%
And definitely unexplained.

over 90 meters in height.

00:20:44.570 --> 00:20:46.850 align:middle line:84%
According to NASA
and other scientists,

00:20:46.850 --> 00:20:49.040 align:middle line:84%
there had to be a
natural explanation

00:20:49.040 --> 00:20:50.750 align:middle line:90%

However, there are no
similar examples in our world

00:20:57.290 --> 00:21:00.470 align:middle line:84%

a rock of this size

00:21:00.470 --> 00:21:04.610 align:middle line:84%
stands erect in the middle
of the desert of Phobos.

00:21:04.610 --> 00:21:09.140 align:middle line:84%
This monolith is truly,
an unidentified mystery.

00:21:09.140 --> 00:21:13.370 align:middle line:84%
The monolith was observed from

there are no other protrusions

Its existence on Phobos is
incredible, to say the least.

00:21:29.600 --> 00:21:31.490 align:middle line:84%
The images have
led some to believe

00:21:31.490 --> 00:21:33.200 align:middle line:84%
that it was
constructed and erected

00:21:33.200 --> 00:21:36.200 align:middle line:84%

civilization.

00:21:36.200 --> 00:21:39.020 align:middle line:84%

with a huge protoplanet,
a planetary embryo

00:24:57.270 --> 00:25:00.660 align:middle line:84%
billions of years ago, which
created the two moons that we

00:25:00.660 --> 00:25:04.350 align:middle line:90%
have named, Phobos and Deimos.

00:25:04.350 --> 00:25:06.570 align:middle line:84%
It is believed that a
similar type of collision

00:25:06.570 --> 00:25:09.210 align:middle line:84%
led to the creation
of Earth's moon.

00:25:09.210 --> 00:25:12.540 align:middle line:84%
But our moon is large,
and Phobos and Deimos

00:25:12.540 --> 00:25:14.250 align:middle line:90%
are quite small.

00:25:14.250 --> 00:25:18.600 align:middle line:84%
Such an impact should have given
Mars a much larger satellite.

00:25:18.600 --> 00:25:23.870 align:middle line:90%


00:25:23.870 --> 00:25:27.530 align:middle line:84%
However, a couple of
studies published in 2016

00:25:27.530 --> 00:25:29.480 align:middle line:90%
might have solved the mystery.

00:25:29.480 --> 00:25:32.810 align:middle line:84%
Both concluded that the
third idea is correct.

00:25:32.810 --> 00:25:35.180 align:middle line:84%
And while one says
that the moons are not

00:25:35.180 --> 00:25:38.420 align:middle line:84%
trapped asteroids,
the second establishes

00:25:38.420 --> 00:25:42.920 align:middle line:84%
a detailed hypothesis that
can explain how Mars ended up

00:25:42.920 --> 00:25:45.650 align:middle line:90%
having two small moons.

00:25:45.650 --> 00:25:49.430 align:middle line:84%
Apparently, a huge impact on
Mars generated a large moon.

00:25:49.430 --> 00:25:52.190 align:middle line:10%
And that great moon
split, and gave rise

00:25:52.190 --> 00:25:55.040 align:middle line:10%
to the formation of
Phobos and Deimos.

00:25:55.040 --> 00:25:59.360 align:middle line:10%
And left many other satellite
objects from the debris.

00:25:59.360 --> 00:26:01.970 align:middle line:84%
And finally, the great
moon, and everything

00:26:01.970 --> 00:26:07.640 align:middle line:84%
except the two small moons,
Phobos and Deimos, survived.

00:26:07.640 --> 00:26:10.835 align:middle line:84%
Other pieces disintegrated or
crashed to the Martian surface.

00:26:10.835 --> 00:26:14.998 align:middle line:90%

00:26:18.370 --> 00:26:22.110 align:middle line:84%
>> However, some expeditions
that had been proposed

00:26:22.110 --> 00:26:26.040 align:middle line:84%
to analyze the composition of
Phobos and its monolith could

00:26:26.040 --> 00:26:29.850 align:middle line:84%
test the idea that it is not
a natural moon, but really,

00:26:29.850 --> 00:26:30.930 align:middle line:90%
a hollow moon.

00:26:30.930 --> 00:26:33.900 align:middle line:90%
However, time is of the essence.

00:26:33.900 --> 00:26:39.300 align:middle line:84%
In 2015, NASA suggested that
Phobos is disintegrating little

00:26:39.300 --> 00:26:40.370 align:middle line:90%
by little.

00:26:40.370 --> 00:26:45.150 align:middle line:84%
The furrows of its surface could
be early signs of this process.

00:26:45.150 --> 00:26:47.610 align:middle line:84%
Luckily, there is
still a lot of time

00:26:47.610 --> 00:26:50.070 align:middle line:90%
to visit Phobos before it dies.

00:26:50.070 --> 00:26:53.400 align:middle line:84%
It will take 30 to 50
million years for it

00:26:53.400 --> 00:26:55.650 align:middle line:90%
to completely disintegrate.

00:26:55.650 --> 00:26:57.630 align:middle line:84%
On the next episode
of "Nuevo", we

00:26:57.630 --> 00:27:00.150 align:middle line:84%
analyze other strange
structures that

00:27:00.150 --> 00:27:02.460 align:middle line:84%
have been photographed
on Mars that

00:27:02.460 --> 00:27:06.120 align:middle line:84%
suggest the possibility
of intelligent presence

00:27:06.120 --> 00:27:07.320 align:middle line:90%
on the planet.
