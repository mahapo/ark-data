phenomenon was observed.

Russian military,

00:12:00.130 --> 00:12:02.500 align:middle line:84%
it could have been a
Bulava nuclear missile

00:12:02.500 --> 00:12:05.140 align:middle line:84%

Russia in the wide sea.

but that the third stage
strangely did not work.

they had denied failure

and would do so
until 24 hours later.

phenomenon was solely

observed in Norway and not
in the territory closer

missile failure

was not confirmed by the
Norwegian Defense Secretary.

that it is an out of control

is a tetrahedron

But a pyramid is five sided,
so this was a tetrahedron.

00:19:34.460 --> 00:19:38.690 align:middle line:84%
And it was floating over the
Kremlin for several hours.

And my conclusion
was that there was

00:20:14.040 --> 00:20:19.860 align:middle line:84%
some linkage between those
different events, that somehow,

00:20:19.860 --> 00:20:24.510 align:middle line:84%
the pyramid or the
tetrahedron, it either

00:20:24.510 --> 00:20:29.190 align:middle line:84%
was something that
came out of the spiral,

00:20:29.190 --> 00:20:31.920 align:middle line:84%
as some people
contend, or it was

00:20:31.920 --> 00:20:37.140 align:middle line:84%
something that caused the
spiral, because there was also

00:20:37.140 --> 00:20:43.230 align:middle line:84%
a Russian ballistic missile test
that occurred at the same time.

00:20:43.230 --> 00:20:45.600 align:middle line:84%

time, was developing

its ballistic missile for

00:20:55.420 --> 00:20:58.560 align:middle line:84%
And it malfunctioned,
according to the Russians.

00:20:58.560 --> 00:21:02.060 align:middle line:84%
And so the Russians said that
this is what caused the spiral.

00:21:02.060 --> 00:21:05.540 align:middle line:84%
But many people believe that
it could not have possibly have

00:21:05.540 --> 00:21:06.630 align:middle line:90%
caused the spiral.

00:21:06.630 --> 00:21:12.090 align:middle line:84%
The spiral was very different
to a disintegrating or a failed

00:21:12.090 --> 00:21:15.773 align:middle line:90%
ballistic missile test.

00:21:15.773 --> 00:21:16.940 align:middle line:90%
>> What do you think it was?

00:21:16.940 --> 00:21:20.830 align:middle line:90%
Why did this happen?

00:21:20.830 --> 00:21:23.850 align:middle line:84%
>> What I think happened
was that basically,

00:21:23.850 --> 00:21:27.090 align:middle line:84%
this was an incident that
I think was basically sent

00:21:27.090 --> 00:21:29.650 align:middle line:90%
to send--

00:21:29.650 --> 00:21:31.560 align:middle line:84%
this was something
that was intended

00:21:31.560 --> 00:21:35.940 align:middle line:84%
to send a message that the
development of nuclear weapons

00:21:35.940 --> 00:21:38.790 align:middle line:90%
was not a good idea.

00:21:38.790 --> 00:21:41.790 align:middle line:84%
>> Dr. Michael Salla is
graduated with a doctorate

00:21:41.790 --> 00:21:44.830 align:middle line:84%
in political science from
the University of Queensland

00:21:44.830 --> 00:21:47.080 align:middle line:84%
and has taught at different
universities in the United

00:21:47.080 --> 00:21:49.300 align:middle line:90%
States.

00:21:49.300 --> 00:21:52.150 align:middle line:84%
He is the founder of
Exopolitical Science,

00:21:52.150 --> 00:21:54.760 align:middle line:84%
presides over the Institute
Effects of Politics

00:21:54.760 --> 00:21:58.870 align:middle line:84%
in Honolulu in Hawaii, has
made various specialized

00:21:58.870 --> 00:22:02.230 align:middle line:84%
publications, and is one of
the most respected authorities

00:22:02.230 --> 00:22:05.500 align:middle line:84%
in the world, although his
comments aroused the most

00:22:05.500 --> 00:22:06.720 align:middle line:90%
opposite reactions.

00:22:06.720 --> 00:22:11.650 align:middle line:84%
But each day, he gains
greater acceptance.

00:22:11.650 --> 00:22:13.700 align:middle line:84%
>> I think there were
extraterrestrials involved

00:22:13.700 --> 00:22:15.110 align:middle line:90%
in this incident.

00:22:15.110 --> 00:22:21.080 align:middle line:84%
And that's why they were
really showing the Russians

00:22:21.080 --> 00:22:24.180 align:middle line:90%
that this was not a good path.

00:22:24.180 --> 00:22:26.000 align:middle line:84%
Because they
basically placed one

00:22:26.000 --> 00:22:30.145 align:middle line:84%
of their craft, the tetrahedron,
directly over the Kremlin,

00:22:30.145 --> 00:22:31.520 align:middle line:84%
sending a message
that, you know,

00:22:31.520 --> 00:22:34.070 align:middle line:84%
your military force
is no match for us.

00:22:34.070 --> 00:22:37.700 align:middle line:84%
You really need to go down
a path of global peace.

00:22:37.700 --> 00:22:40.520 align:middle line:84%
The Russian government
tried to cover it up.

00:22:40.520 --> 00:22:44.840 align:middle line:84%
But nevertheless, we
did have a few people

00:22:44.840 --> 00:22:47.280 align:middle line:84%
that were able to upload
this to the internet.

00:22:47.280 --> 00:22:48.080 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:22:48.080 --> 00:22:53.500 align:middle line:84%
We have two videos, one at
night and one in the daytime.

00:22:53.500 --> 00:22:54.500 align:middle line:90%
>> That's exactly right.

00:22:54.500 --> 00:22:57.880 align:middle line:84%
Yes, we see very clearly
that this was something that

00:22:57.880 --> 00:23:00.500 align:middle line:90%
was hovering over the Kremlin.

00:23:00.500 --> 00:23:03.420 align:middle line:84%
There were different sources,
photographing and videotaping

00:23:03.420 --> 00:23:04.220 align:middle line:90%
this.

00:23:04.220 --> 00:23:09.370 align:middle line:84%
And it's very clear that this
was a very large tetrahedron

00:23:09.370 --> 00:23:15.320 align:middle line:84%
that basically had some kind of
incredibly advanced technology

00:23:15.320 --> 00:23:18.950 align:middle line:84%
so that it could just hover over
the Kremlin for several hours

00:23:18.950 --> 00:23:22.820 align:middle line:84%
without displaying any
kind of jet engines

00:23:22.820 --> 00:23:25.850 align:middle line:84%
or any kind of
propulsion system.

00:23:25.850 --> 00:23:30.350 align:middle line:84%
So you know, it was using some
kind of anti-gravity technology

00:23:30.350 --> 00:23:35.840 align:middle line:84%
that we would probably have
developed in secret programs.

00:23:35.840 --> 00:23:39.110 align:middle line:84%
But you know, for
a craft that large,

00:23:39.110 --> 00:23:43.910 align:middle line:84%
one mile in diameter, that
must have very powerful engines

00:23:43.910 --> 00:23:46.130 align:middle line:84%
to have it just sit
over the Kremlin

00:23:46.130 --> 00:23:48.710 align:middle line:84%
for several hours
in the early morning

00:23:48.710 --> 00:23:54.330 align:middle line:84%
and in the early morning
day, during the day as well.

00:23:54.330 --> 00:23:58.190 align:middle line:84%
>> 10 years later, President
Vladimir Putin announced

00:23:58.190 --> 00:24:00.920 align:middle line:84%
the result of the development
of the newest and most

00:24:00.920 --> 00:24:04.020 align:middle line:84%
sophisticated weapons that
could end life on Earth.

00:24:04.020 --> 00:24:07.250 align:middle line:90%


00:24:07.250 --> 00:24:09.470 align:middle line:84%
For decades, the
world was on the brink

00:24:09.470 --> 00:24:13.340 align:middle line:84%
of a catastrophic nuclear
war between the United States

00:24:13.340 --> 00:24:16.850 align:middle line:84%
and the Union of Soviet
Socialist Republics.

00:24:16.850 --> 00:24:19.490 align:middle line:84%
This danger was averted
with the dissolution

00:24:19.490 --> 00:24:23.000 align:middle line:90%
of the Soviet bloc in 1991.

00:24:23.000 --> 00:24:25.310 align:middle line:84%
But now, the nuclear
threat returns

00:24:25.310 --> 00:24:27.920 align:middle line:84%
with a new rivalry
between the United States

00:24:27.920 --> 00:24:34.190 align:middle line:84%
and nations such as Russia,
China, Iran, and North Korea.

00:24:34.190 --> 00:24:36.590 align:middle line:10%
A new arms race has
begun that could

00:24:36.590 --> 00:24:38.760 align:middle line:10%
culminate in the complete
destruction of much

00:24:38.760 --> 00:24:39.560 align:middle line:10%
of our planet.

00:24:39.560 --> 00:24:42.460 align:middle line:90%


00:24:42.460 --> 00:24:46.080 align:middle line:84%
The atomic bomb, the
deadliest man-made weapon,

00:24:46.080 --> 00:24:49.830 align:middle line:84%
has evolved since it was first
used by the United States

00:24:49.830 --> 00:24:53.730 align:middle line:84%
in 1945 against the population
of the Japanese cities

00:24:53.730 --> 00:24:55.350 align:middle line:90%
of Hiroshima and Nagasaki.

00:24:55.350 --> 00:24:58.610 align:middle line:90%


00:24:58.610 --> 00:25:01.320 align:middle line:10%
Today, there are bombs
thousands of times

00:25:01.320 --> 00:25:05.120 align:middle line:10%
more powerful than those
detonated in Japan,

00:25:05.120 --> 00:25:07.440 align:middle line:10%
and are so small
that they can be

00:25:07.440 --> 00:25:12.360 align:middle line:10%
integrated into small
missiles and submarines.

00:25:12.360 --> 00:25:14.340 align:middle line:84%
On the other hand,
nuclear powers

00:25:14.340 --> 00:25:16.890 align:middle line:84%
could be developing
intercontinental ballistic

00:25:16.890 --> 00:25:20.190 align:middle line:84%
missiles with the ability to
hit anywhere on the globe.

00:25:20.190 --> 00:25:23.230 align:middle line:90%


00:25:23.230 --> 00:25:27.000 align:middle line:10%
This was revealed on
August 18th, 2019,

00:25:27.000 --> 00:25:29.010 align:middle line:10%
when an explosion
occurred on a test

00:25:29.010 --> 00:25:33.060 align:middle line:10%
platform in the Arkhangelsk
region in the north of Russia,

00:25:33.060 --> 00:25:35.640 align:middle line:10%
with a balance of at
least seven deaths

00:25:35.640 --> 00:25:38.520 align:middle line:10%
and that released a radiation
to the environment that

00:25:38.520 --> 00:25:42.300 align:middle line:10%
was detected miles away.

00:25:42.300 --> 00:25:47.490 align:middle line:84%
These are experiments with a new
class of nuclear fuel, material

00:25:47.490 --> 00:25:51.480 align:middle line:84%
that, among other applications,
would allow missiles to reach

00:25:51.480 --> 00:25:54.150 align:middle line:90%
anywhere on the planet.

00:25:54.150 --> 00:25:57.880 align:middle line:84%
The missile, called
9M730 Burevestnik,

00:25:57.880 --> 00:26:00.880 align:middle line:84%
is one of the six new
strategic weapons announced

00:26:00.880 --> 00:26:04.030 align:middle line:84%
by the president of
Russia, Vladimir Putin,

00:26:04.030 --> 00:26:07.480 align:middle line:90%
on March 1st, 2018.

00:26:07.480 --> 00:26:09.100 align:middle line:90%
We call it Sarmat.

00:26:09.100 --> 00:26:11.590 align:middle line:84%
It will be equipped
with a wide variety

00:26:11.590 --> 00:26:15.850 align:middle line:84%
of powerful nuclear munitions,
hypersonic missiles included.

00:26:15.850 --> 00:26:19.420 align:middle line:84%
The new system has practically
no limits on a scope.

00:26:19.420 --> 00:26:20.250 align:middle line:90%
We call it Kinzhal.

00:26:20.250 --> 00:26:22.990 align:middle line:90%


00:26:22.990 --> 00:26:25.750 align:middle line:84%
The new missile flies
at hypersonic speed

00:26:25.750 --> 00:26:28.190 align:middle line:84%
and even maneuvers
throughout its trajectory.

00:26:28.190 --> 00:26:31.580 align:middle line:90%


00:26:31.580 --> 00:26:34.010 align:middle line:84%
We successfully launched
a new cruise missile

00:26:34.010 --> 00:26:36.710 align:middle line:84%
with a nuclear power
system that guarantees

00:26:36.710 --> 00:26:43.390 align:middle line:84%
a flight distance
10 times greater,

00:26:43.390 --> 00:26:45.970 align:middle line:90%
so it is practically unlimited.

00:26:45.970 --> 00:26:49.540 align:middle line:84%
Russia has developed
unmanned underwater vehicles

00:26:49.540 --> 00:26:52.060 align:middle line:84%
capable of operating
at great depths

00:26:52.060 --> 00:26:54.550 align:middle line:84%
and traveling
intercontinental distances,

00:26:54.550 --> 00:26:57.760 align:middle line:84%
with a speed exceeding several
times that of the fastest

00:26:57.760 --> 00:27:00.430 align:middle line:84%
submarines, torpedoes,
and surface ships.

00:27:00.430 --> 00:27:03.850 align:middle line:90%


00:27:03.850 --> 00:27:06.820 align:middle line:90%
We call this missile Avangard.

00:27:06.820 --> 00:27:11.560 align:middle line:84%
It goes towards a target like
a meteorite, like a fireball.

00:27:11.560 --> 00:27:16.420 align:middle line:84%
Its surface temperature
reaches between 1,600 and 2,000

00:27:16.420 --> 00:27:18.500 align:middle line:90%
degrees Celsius.

00:27:18.500 --> 00:27:23.080 align:middle line:84%
This kind of weaponry is not
owned by anyone in the world.

00:27:23.080 --> 00:27:25.630 align:middle line:10%
For its part, the
United States is also

00:27:25.630 --> 00:27:31.720 align:middle line:10%
developing new nuclear weapons
such as a W76-2 warhead,

00:27:31.720 --> 00:27:34.960 align:middle line:10%
a nuclear weapon with a third of
the power of the bomb detonated

00:27:34.960 --> 00:27:38.620 align:middle line:10%
in Hiroshima with which the
American submarines are being

00:27:38.620 --> 00:27:42.010 align:middle line:10%
equipped, a new strategy
that could increase

00:27:42.010 --> 00:27:46.880 align:middle line:10%
the risk of conflict, as
these smaller bombs are more

00:27:46.880 --> 00:27:50.480 align:middle line:10%
likely to be used compared
to weapons hundreds

00:27:50.480 --> 00:27:54.590 align:middle line:10%
or even thousands of
times more powerful.

00:27:54.590 --> 00:27:58.670 align:middle line:84%
Another event that has increased
the risk of armed conflict

00:27:58.670 --> 00:28:00.620 align:middle line:84%
is the departure of
the United States,

00:28:00.620 --> 00:28:02.870 align:middle line:84%
by order of President
Donald Trump,

00:28:02.870 --> 00:28:06.390 align:middle line:84%
from the agreement
reached in 2015 with Iran,

00:28:06.390 --> 00:28:08.840 align:middle line:84%
which sought to prevent
this country from developing

00:28:08.840 --> 00:28:10.380 align:middle line:90%
nuclear weapons.

00:28:10.380 --> 00:28:15.410 align:middle line:84%
Instead, the US president has
implemented economic sanctions

00:28:15.410 --> 00:28:19.310 align:middle line:84%
which so far, have
proven to be ineffective.

00:28:19.310 --> 00:28:21.620 align:middle line:84%
Since countries like
China and Russia

00:28:21.620 --> 00:28:25.550 align:middle line:84%
financially helped the Iranian
regime and those most affected,

00:28:25.550 --> 00:28:27.350 align:middle line:84%
it is a people,
in general, which

00:28:27.350 --> 00:28:30.080 align:middle line:84%
increases hatred and the
rejection towards the North

00:28:30.080 --> 00:28:31.910 align:middle line:90%
American country.

00:28:31.910 --> 00:28:34.820 align:middle line:10%
For its part, Iran has
been gradually increasing

00:28:34.820 --> 00:28:39.190 align:middle line:10%
the level of uranium
enrichment, increasing tension

00:28:39.190 --> 00:28:42.010 align:middle line:10%
and the possibility of a
new armed conflict starting

00:28:42.010 --> 00:28:46.900 align:middle line:10%
in the Middle East, war in which
countries such as China, which

00:28:46.900 --> 00:28:49.810 align:middle line:10%
has a strong economic
interest in the region,

00:28:49.810 --> 00:28:51.430 align:middle line:10%
could be involved.

00:28:51.430 --> 00:28:54.340 align:middle line:84%
Not content with ending
all kinds of regulations

00:28:54.340 --> 00:28:57.580 align:middle line:84%
to protect the
environment, Donald Trump

00:28:57.580 --> 00:29:02.110 align:middle line:84%
seems to be working to make the
world a more dangerous place.

00:29:02.110 --> 00:29:05.470 align:middle line:10%
This is demonstrated by the
recent departure of the United

00:29:05.470 --> 00:29:09.010 align:middle line:10%
States from the Intermediate
Range Nuclear Forces Treaty,

00:29:09.010 --> 00:29:12.530 align:middle line:10%
an agreement signed in 1987 by
then president of the United

00:29:12.530 --> 00:29:15.580 align:middle line:10%
States, Ronald
Reagan, and president

00:29:15.580 --> 00:29:19.930 align:middle line:10%
of the Soviet Union, Mikhail
Gorbachev, which prohibited

00:29:19.930 --> 00:29:23.950 align:middle line:10%
the deployment of all ballistic,
cruise, or shuttle missile

00:29:23.950 --> 00:29:27.550 align:middle line:10%
with a range of between
500 and 5,000 kilometers

00:29:27.550 --> 00:29:29.440 align:middle line:10%
in European territory.

00:29:29.440 --> 00:29:37.270 align:middle line:84%
As a result of that agreement,
by 1991, 2,692 NATO missiles

00:29:37.270 --> 00:29:43.090 align:middle line:84%
were destroyed, while the
Soviet Union destroyed 1,846.

00:29:43.090 --> 00:29:47.110 align:middle line:84%
Now, the suspension of the
agreement by President Trump

00:29:47.110 --> 00:29:49.390 align:middle line:84%
marks the beginning
of a new arms race

00:29:49.390 --> 00:29:51.940 align:middle line:84%
and brings us closer to
a large scale conflict.

00:29:55.820 --> 00:29:58.130 align:middle line:84%
Today, we are closer
than ever to what

00:29:58.130 --> 00:29:59.930 align:middle line:90%
could become a nuclear war.

00:29:59.930 --> 00:30:03.600 align:middle line:90%


00:30:03.600 --> 00:30:05.700 align:middle line:10%
Atomic weapons have multiplied.

00:30:05.700 --> 00:30:07.710 align:middle line:10%
The words of
President Barack Obama

00:30:07.710 --> 00:30:12.280 align:middle line:10%
when he received the Nobel
Prize on December 10th, 2009

00:30:12.280 --> 00:30:15.750 align:middle line:10%
acquire a relevant meaning
from the extraordinary events

00:30:15.750 --> 00:30:19.590 align:middle line:10%
that occurred in
Norway and Russia,

00:30:19.590 --> 00:30:23.040 align:middle line:10%
without a doubt, one of the
most extraordinary mysteries

00:30:23.040 --> 00:30:25.990 align:middle line:10%
of all time.

00:30:25.990 --> 00:30:29.690 align:middle line:10%
>> The non-violence practiced
by men like Gandhi and King may

00:30:29.690 --> 00:30:32.630 align:middle line:10%
not have been practical or
possible in every circumstance.

00:30:32.630 --> 00:30:38.930 align:middle line:10%
But the love that they preached,
their fundamental faith

00:30:38.930 --> 00:30:42.650 align:middle line:10%
in human progress, that must
always be the North Star that

00:30:42.650 --> 00:30:43.790 align:middle line:10%
guides us on our journey.

00:30:43.790 --> 00:30:46.540 align:middle line:10%


00:30:46.540 --> 00:30:53.060 align:middle line:10%
For if we lose that faith, if
we dismiss it as silly or naive,

00:30:53.060 --> 00:30:54.710 align:middle line:10%
if we divorce it
from the decisions

00:30:54.710 --> 00:30:59.030 align:middle line:10%
that we make on issues
of war and peace,

00:30:59.030 --> 00:31:02.730 align:middle line:10%
then we lose what's
best about humanity.

00:31:02.730 --> 00:31:06.440 align:middle line:10%
We lose our sense
of possibility.

00:31:06.440 --> 00:31:07.700 align:middle line:10%
We lose our moral compass.

00:31:07.700 --> 00:31:10.930 align:middle line:90%


00:31:10.930 --> 00:31:17.120 align:middle line:10%
Like generations have before
us, we must reject that future.

00:31:17.120 --> 00:31:20.480 align:middle line:10%
As Dr. King said at this
occasion so many years ago,

00:31:20.480 --> 00:31:23.840 align:middle line:10%
"I refuse to accept despair
as the final response

00:31:23.840 --> 00:31:27.120 align:middle line:10%
to the ambiguities of history.

00:31:27.120 --> 00:31:31.410 align:middle line:10%
I refuse to accept the idea
that the is-ness of man's

00:31:31.410 --> 00:31:34.500 align:middle line:10%
present condition makes him
morally incapable of reaching

00:31:34.500 --> 00:31:38.970 align:middle line:10%
up for the eternal ought-ness
that forever confronts him."

00:31:38.970 --> 00:31:43.510 align:middle line:90%


00:31:43.510 --> 00:31:48.020 align:middle line:10%
Let us reach for the
world that ought to be,

00:31:48.020 --> 00:31:50.900 align:middle line:10%
that spark of the
divine that still steers

00:31:50.900 --> 00:31:52.270 align:middle line:10%
within each of our souls.

00:31:52.270 --> 00:31:55.602 align:middle line:10%

00:32:01.790 --> 00:32:04.010 align:middle line:84%
>> The cases that were
caught on December 9th,

00:32:04.010 --> 00:32:09.160 align:middle line:84%
2009 in Russia and Norway
are not only extraordinary,

00:32:09.160 --> 00:32:13.310 align:middle line:84%
but are clearly a message, a
warning that, unfortunately,

00:32:13.310 --> 00:32:14.990 align:middle line:90%
is being fulfilled.

00:32:14.990 --> 00:32:19.980 align:middle line:84%
Today, we are closer than ever
to a possible nuclear war.

00:32:19.980 --> 00:32:23.390 align:middle line:84%
However, nine years
after this warning,

00:32:23.390 --> 00:32:26.000 align:middle line:84%
it would be presented
again, but now

00:32:26.000 --> 00:32:29.630 align:middle line:84%
above the Pentagon in
Washington, a warning that

00:32:29.630 --> 00:32:31.640 align:middle line:90%
should not be ignored.

00:32:31.640 --> 00:32:34.340 align:middle line:84%

00:32:34.340 --> 00:32:37.115 align:middle line:90%
