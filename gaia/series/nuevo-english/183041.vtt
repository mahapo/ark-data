Wednesday, March 25, 1948,

when patrolman Manuel Sandoval
followed a strange light

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:34.820 align:middle line:10%
in the desert, similar to what
had been seen the previous

00:01:34.820 --> 00:01:38.480 align:middle line:10%
three nights in the small
town of Cuba, New Mexico.

The mysterious
light appeared to be

00:01:40.430 --> 00:01:45.470 align:middle line:84%
an airship or saucer that was
moving slowly over New Mexico.

00:01:45.470 --> 00:01:49.370 align:middle line:84%
Officer Sandoval was determined
to uncover the mystery.

00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:51.290 align:middle line:84%
After several hours
on a remote road

00:01:51.290 --> 00:01:54.170 align:middle line:84%
in Hart Canyon near
Aztec, New Mexico,

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:57.620 align:middle line:84%
he encountered an
unexpected scene.

00:01:57.620 --> 00:02:00.350 align:middle line:84%
Patrolman Sandoval was
surprised that the object

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:03.980 align:middle line:84%
could have landed so softly
on a clearing in the brush.

00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:06.440 align:middle line:84%
It was dawn, and
20 men surrounded

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:08.600 align:middle line:84%
a strange circular
metal ship that

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:11.450 align:middle line:90%
lay on a plateau near a gorge.

00:02:11.450 --> 00:02:13.730 align:middle line:84%
According to their
version of the story,

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:15.440 align:middle line:84%
they didn't reach
the site as quickly

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:18.290 align:middle line:84%
as they wanted because a brush
fire was close to where they

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:21.380 align:middle line:84%
worked and could have threatened
the equipment that extracted

00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:23.660 align:middle line:90%
natural gas from the ground.

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:25.970 align:middle line:84%
The workers in the
oil and gas industry

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:28.430 align:middle line:84%
were fascinated
with what they saw.

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:31.070 align:middle line:84%
They thought that it was a
new type of airplane belonging

00:02:31.070 --> 00:02:32.990 align:middle line:90%
to the United States Air Force.

00:02:32.990 --> 00:02:35.300 align:middle line:84%
However, it was
strangely shaped.

00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:38.600 align:middle line:84%
It didn't have wings, nor
the form of an airplane.

00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:42.380 align:middle line:84%
They surmised it was some kind
of strategic secret weapon.

00:02:42.380 --> 00:02:45.050 align:middle line:84%
After all, the military
had surprised the world

00:02:45.050 --> 00:02:48.590 align:middle line:84%
by manufacturing the first
atomic bomb and the use

00:02:48.590 --> 00:02:50.570 align:middle line:90%
of nuclear energy in the area.

00:02:54.320 --> 00:02:58.840 align:middle line:84%
The ship metallic and silver
in color but not shiny.

00:02:58.840 --> 00:03:02.890 align:middle line:84%
Inside, they observed at
least four small dead bodies

00:03:02.890 --> 00:03:05.960 align:middle line:90%
in the main cabin.

00:03:05.960 --> 00:03:08.330 align:middle line:90%
The beings did not look human.

00:03:08.330 --> 00:03:11.240 align:middle line:84%
It was then that they realized
that the reports of flying

00:03:11.240 --> 00:03:14.510 align:middle line:84%
saucers were real, and
that the stories of aliens

00:03:14.510 --> 00:03:17.600 align:middle line:84%
from another world had
crashed in San Antonio, New

00:03:17.600 --> 00:03:18.980 align:middle line:90%
Mexico, and Roswell.

00:03:22.190 --> 00:03:24.650 align:middle line:84%
Later, after the
military arrived,

00:03:24.650 --> 00:03:27.260 align:middle line:84%
everyone was questioned,
interrogated,

00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:29.030 align:middle line:90%
and even threatened.

00:03:29.030 --> 00:03:31.940 align:middle line:84%
Their cameras and
film were confiscated.

00:03:31.940 --> 00:03:37.370 align:middle line:84%
In total, there were between
14 and 16 small dead bodies.

00:03:37.370 --> 00:03:40.220 align:middle line:84%
The beings were barely
1 meter in height.

00:03:40.220 --> 00:03:43.100 align:middle line:84%
They all looked
burned and dehydrated.

00:03:43.100 --> 00:03:45.335 align:middle line:84%
And they were wearing
odd metallic clothes.

00:03:45.335 --> 00:03:48.830 align:middle line:90%


00:03:48.830 --> 00:03:52.100 align:middle line:84%
Years later, one of the
scientists involved thoroughly

00:03:52.100 --> 00:03:54.990 align:middle line:84%
studied the findings
and wrote a book.

00:03:54.990 --> 00:03:57.530 align:middle line:84%
He presented his
conclusions in a conference

00:03:57.530 --> 00:04:01.970 align:middle line:84%
and revealed specific details
of the crashes and beings.

00:04:01.970 --> 00:04:04.970 align:middle line:84%
Those involved in releasing
the information to the public

00:04:04.970 --> 00:04:08.300 align:middle line:84%
were prosecuted and
brought to trial.

00:04:08.300 --> 00:04:11.720 align:middle line:84%
History would be forgotten
for more than 40 years,

00:04:11.720 --> 00:04:16.079 align:middle line:84%
until another investigation
was carried out.

00:04:16.079 --> 00:04:19.230 align:middle line:84%
More details had been
found, facts that would

00:04:19.230 --> 00:04:22.350 align:middle line:90%
confirm the extraordinary case.

00:04:22.350 --> 00:04:24.780 align:middle line:84%
Then, another 20
years had passed,

00:04:24.780 --> 00:04:26.940 align:middle line:84%
which would be more
than 60 years total

00:04:26.940 --> 00:04:30.090 align:middle line:84%
from the original
sightings and discoveries

00:04:30.090 --> 00:04:34.680 align:middle line:84%
before a new investigation
revealed the names of all those

00:04:34.680 --> 00:04:37.310 align:middle line:90%
involved.

00:04:37.310 --> 00:04:39.500 align:middle line:84%
Direct testimonies
were obtained,

00:04:39.500 --> 00:04:41.990 align:middle line:84%
and finally the identities
of the scientists

00:04:41.990 --> 00:04:45.110 align:middle line:84%

most extraordinary incidents

00:04:45.110 --> 00:04:46.790 align:middle line:90%

kilometers-- away

00:05:06.610 --> 00:05:10.200 align:middle line:90%

the first atomic bomb

00:05:13.140 --> 00:05:18.750 align:middle line:10%
was detonated and
tested in 1945.

00:05:18.750 --> 00:05:22.830 align:middle line:84%
Aztec is located very close to
the Los Alamos Nuclear Power

00:05:22.830 --> 00:05:28.360 align:middle line:84%
Plant, where the first
atomic bombs were built.

00:05:28.360 --> 00:05:30.970 align:middle line:84%
This area is called
Aztec because it

00:05:30.970 --> 00:05:34.240 align:middle line:84%
was named after Aztec
archaeological mines that

00:05:34.240 --> 00:05:35.340 align:middle line:90%
were discovered there.

Curiously, all those

However, one Doug Nolan decided
to talk before he passed away.

Here is a testimony

00:06:40.940 --> 00:06:43.910 align:middle line:84%
At the time of his
experience in 1948,

Doug was just 19 years old.

00:06:51.760 --> 00:06:53.230 align:middle line:90%
And that's what the book says.

00:06:53.230 --> 00:06:55.700 align:middle line:84%
>> And it had a
dome at the bottom.

Well, I don't know.

00:06:56.650 --> 00:06:58.020 align:middle line:90%
Never paid any-- it was buried.

00:06:58.020 --> 00:06:59.870 align:middle line:90%
It was sitting in the dirt.

This up here is where the
door come down, though.

00:07:02.566 --> 00:07:07.100 align:middle line:84%
It opened from right at the
top out and just folded down.

00:07:07.100 --> 00:07:10.286 align:middle line:84%
>> So how long were you there
before the military got there?

00:07:10.286 --> 00:07:14.630 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, about five hours--

00:07:14.630 --> 00:07:16.270 align:middle line:90%
five or six.

00:07:16.270 --> 00:07:18.060 align:middle line:90%

that it was the police
who informed the army

of the crash of the alien ship.

neighbors in the area that

00:07:40.940 --> 00:07:44.510 align:middle line:90%
alerted authorities.

Or did you call the sheriff?

00:07:48.820 --> 00:07:51.146 align:middle line:90%
>> We didn't call the military.

who called them.

I don't know whether he
called the military or not.

00:17:26.369 --> 00:17:29.700 align:middle line:84%
Army inadvertently brought
their craft to the ground

00:17:29.700 --> 00:17:32.610 align:middle line:84%
and caused the
death of the beings?

00:17:32.610 --> 00:17:34.920 align:middle line:84%
Later, that type
of powerful radar

00:17:34.920 --> 00:17:38.340 align:middle line:84%
was discontinued because
it caused serious injuries

00:17:38.340 --> 00:17:41.550 align:middle line:84%
to their operators and
was suspected to interfere

00:17:41.550 --> 00:17:44.190 align:middle line:90%
with airplanes' instruments.

00:17:44.190 --> 00:17:48.210 align:middle line:84%
Even today, we acknowledge that
strong microwaves and radiation

00:17:48.210 --> 00:17:51.870 align:middle line:84%
can affect human health
in a harmful way.

00:17:51.870 --> 00:17:55.200 align:middle line:10%
We know that the radars
operating in 1945

00:17:55.200 --> 00:17:57.930 align:middle line:10%
used up to 1 megawatt
of power, which

00:17:57.930 --> 00:17:59.970 align:middle line:10%
made it a lethal
weapon for flying

00:17:59.970 --> 00:18:01.860 align:middle line:10%
ships and their occupants.

00:18:01.860 --> 00:18:03.960 align:middle line:84%
Over the years, it
has been demonstrated

00:18:03.960 --> 00:18:07.020 align:middle line:84%
that radars and microwaves
are dangerous and should

00:18:07.020 --> 00:18:08.790 align:middle line:90%
be handled with care.

00:18:08.790 --> 00:18:11.460 align:middle line:84%
The case of Aztec seems
to be a clear indication

00:18:11.460 --> 00:18:16.870 align:middle line:84%
that microwaves literally cooked
the beings inside their ship.

00:18:16.870 --> 00:18:19.570 align:middle line:84%
Scott Ramsey was able
to locate information

00:18:19.570 --> 00:18:22.360 align:middle line:84%
on the radars that
were used back then,

00:18:22.360 --> 00:18:25.150 align:middle line:84%
evidence that included
documentation in the FBI

00:18:25.150 --> 00:18:28.660 align:middle line:84%
memorandum we have revealed
that supports the reality

00:18:28.660 --> 00:18:32.230 align:middle line:84%
that microwaves were, indeed,
responsible for bringing down

00:18:32.230 --> 00:18:34.390 align:middle line:84%
the objects that
fell from the sky

00:18:34.390 --> 00:18:38.530 align:middle line:84%
in New Mexico between
1945 and 1950.

00:18:38.530 --> 00:18:40.450 align:middle line:84%
Evidence demonstrates
the likelihood

00:18:40.450 --> 00:18:43.480 align:middle line:84%
that strong radars interfered
with the navigation

00:18:43.480 --> 00:18:46.510 align:middle line:84%
system of the
extraterrestrial spacecraft.

00:18:46.510 --> 00:18:49.360 align:middle line:84%
The first of these bases
was known as El Vado

00:18:49.360 --> 00:18:52.120 align:middle line:90%
and operated until 1950.

00:18:52.120 --> 00:18:58.960 align:middle line:84%
>> El Vado Dam, or the entire
El Vado Lake was built prior

00:18:58.960 --> 00:19:03.220 align:middle line:90%
to Los Alamos being completed.

00:19:03.220 --> 00:19:06.910 align:middle line:84%
Los Alamos is right over the
mountain range over there.

00:19:06.910 --> 00:19:10.967 align:middle line:84%
They needed electricity
at Los Alamos

00:19:10.967 --> 00:19:12.550 align:middle line:84%
to do all the things
they were doing--

00:19:12.550 --> 00:19:18.700 align:middle line:84%
fusion, fission, splitting
atoms, refining the plutonium.

00:19:18.700 --> 00:19:20.950 align:middle line:84%
So what they did was they--
you can see how this is

00:19:20.950 --> 00:19:23.230 align:middle line:90%
hand-carved, this whole like.

00:19:23.230 --> 00:19:25.360 align:middle line:90%
This is a man-made lake.

00:19:25.360 --> 00:19:29.110 align:middle line:84%
And there's a GE
hydroelectric generator

00:19:29.110 --> 00:19:32.290 align:middle line:84%
just below that building
that makes the power.

00:19:32.290 --> 00:19:34.960 align:middle line:84%
And then the power was
transmitted down these lines

00:19:34.960 --> 00:19:36.324 align:middle line:90%
to Los Alamos.

00:19:36.324 --> 00:19:37.940 align:middle line:90%

base was known as Tierra

operated between 1950 and 1957.

The development
of new technology

00:19:50.620 --> 00:19:52.850 align:middle line:90%
eventually made it obsolete.

00:19:52.850 --> 00:19:58.826 align:middle line:84%
And the base was abandoned,
not to be used since 1957.

>> How many people were here?

00:20:01.070 --> 00:20:03.110 align:middle line:90%
>> About 100.

00:20:03.110 --> 00:20:05.240 align:middle line:90%
They worked three shifts.

00:20:05.240 --> 00:20:14.720 align:middle line:84%
I think it grew to about 200 by
the mid '50s and through 1957,

00:20:14.720 --> 00:20:17.750 align:middle line:84%
when they were announcing that
they were closing it and going

00:20:17.750 --> 00:20:19.130 align:middle line:90%
with the DEW Line radar system.

radars right after the war?

>> These were here
for one main purpose,

00:20:29.430 --> 00:20:35.620 align:middle line:84%
and that was to protect Los
Alamos, Sandia National Labs,

00:20:35.620 --> 00:20:38.858 align:middle line:90%
and Kirtland Air Force Base.

00:20:38.858 --> 00:20:41.150 align:middle line:84%
And if you look at where they
are on a map, which we'll

00:20:41.150 --> 00:20:45.380 align:middle line:90%
do later, El Vado was north.

00:20:45.380 --> 00:20:47.270 align:middle line:90%
It was far north.

00:20:47.270 --> 00:20:52.790 align:middle line:84%

Continental Divide was west.

We were well-- actually,
well into the Cold War.

00:21:00.230 --> 00:21:03.770 align:middle line:84%
So we were protecting
these bases

00:21:03.770 --> 00:21:09.800 align:middle line:84%
against espionage, spy planes,
or bomber raids by the Soviets.

back in January 8th of 1999,

by accident.

looking for the, quote,
unquote, "secret radar bases."

quite by accident.

00:21:39.075 --> 00:21:41.450 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, it was powerful enough
that even though this was

00:21:41.450 --> 00:21:44.360 align:middle line:84%
a restricted airspace
for private aircraft,

00:21:44.360 --> 00:21:48.800 align:middle line:84%
or commercial for that matter,
there were manuals written

00:21:48.800 --> 00:21:53.630 align:middle line:84%
on how to quickly shut the
radar down if a private aircraft

00:21:53.630 --> 00:21:55.520 align:middle line:90%
wandered into this airspace.
