00:00:00.800 --> 00:00:02.260 align:middle line:90%
>> This is "Nuevo."

00:00:02.260 --> 00:00:07.340 align:middle line:84%
Dr. Michio Kaku, one of the
brightest man of the world,

00:00:07.340 --> 00:00:10.100 align:middle line:90%
a privileged mind of our time.

00:00:10.100 --> 00:00:12.770 align:middle line:84%
This is an exclusive
interview that we

00:00:12.770 --> 00:00:16.100 align:middle line:84%
had with Dr. Kaku
recently in Barcelona.

00:00:16.100 --> 00:00:19.495 align:middle line:90%
[THEME MUSIC]

00:00:19.495 --> 00:00:25.800 align:middle line:90%


00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:34.026 align:middle line:10%
>> Gaia presents "Nuevo"
with Jaime Maussan.

00:00:34.026 --> 00:00:39.960 align:middle line:90%


00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:44.850 align:middle line:10%
>> Dr. Michio Kaku was recently
invited to the Ufology World

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:47.010 align:middle line:10%
Congress in Barcelona.

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:50.520 align:middle line:10%
For the first time,
this bright scientist

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:54.360 align:middle line:10%
accepted to participate
in an event like this.

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:57.900 align:middle line:84%
Everyone was really
curious to know what

00:00:57.900 --> 00:01:00.890 align:middle line:90%
he was going to talk about.

00:01:00.890 --> 00:01:03.790 align:middle line:84%
I have this chance to
have this interview,

00:01:03.790 --> 00:01:08.210 align:middle line:84%
and to ask him why finally
he was participating

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:10.840 align:middle line:90%
in a conference like this.

00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:13.980 align:middle line:90%
The answers were surprising.

00:01:13.980 --> 00:01:17.170 align:middle line:84%
And I feel you're going
to enjoy this interview.

00:01:17.170 --> 00:01:20.750 align:middle line:84%
Because she's going to tell
us how the new future is going

00:01:20.750 --> 00:01:24.070 align:middle line:84%
to be, what is going to
happen with the human being,

00:01:24.070 --> 00:01:25.850 align:middle line:90%
and so on.

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:28.600 align:middle line:84%
This is an exclusive
interview of "Nuevo,"

00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:31.370 align:middle line:90%
and I hope you will enjoy it.

00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:33.830 align:middle line:90%
Thank you very much Dr. Kaku.

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:35.380 align:middle line:84%
It's a pleasure to
be here with you.

00:01:35.380 --> 00:01:37.360 align:middle line:90%
>> Mm-hmm.

00:01:37.360 --> 00:01:40.450 align:middle line:84%
>> Why did you accept to
participate in a conference

00:01:40.450 --> 00:01:41.530 align:middle line:90%
like this?

00:01:41.530 --> 00:01:43.210 align:middle line:90%
>> Well, I'm a physicist.

00:01:43.210 --> 00:01:47.050 align:middle line:84%
We believe in things that
are testable, reproducible,

00:01:47.050 --> 00:01:48.790 align:middle line:90%
and falsifiable.

00:01:48.790 --> 00:01:53.380 align:middle line:10%
Now the tide has turned, because
traditionally, scientists

00:01:53.380 --> 00:01:58.480 align:middle line:10%
would giggle and laugh talking
about flying saucers and UFOs.

00:01:58.480 --> 00:02:00.730 align:middle line:10%
The burden of proof
was on the believers--

00:02:00.730 --> 00:02:04.000 align:middle line:10%
prove it, give me the
evidence, show me.

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:07.480 align:middle line:84%
Now the burden of proof has
shifted to the government

00:02:07.480 --> 00:02:08.860 align:middle line:90%
and the military.

00:02:08.860 --> 00:02:12.220 align:middle line:84%
Now they have to prove that
these sightings are not

00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:15.992 align:middle line:84%
from outer space and
another civilization.

00:02:15.992 --> 00:02:17.200 align:middle line:90%
Several things have happened.

00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:20.080 align:middle line:84%
First we have
videotapes, videotapes

00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:24.610 align:middle line:84%
taken by United States Navy
pilots that are testable.

00:02:24.610 --> 00:02:27.790 align:middle line:84%
We can now see and
calculate how fast

00:02:27.790 --> 00:02:32.660 align:middle line:84%
they move, how fast they can
zigzag, what is the altitude.

00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:35.560 align:middle line:84%
We know the parameters
of these objects now.

00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:37.340 align:middle line:90%
We didn't have that before.

00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:40.930 align:middle line:84%
And so this means that the
burden of proof has shifted.

00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:43.000 align:middle line:84%
Now the military,
the government,

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:46.330 align:middle line:84%
has to prove that they are
not from another planet.

00:02:46.330 --> 00:02:50.290 align:middle line:84%
Now, they still might be
hypersonic test vehicles.

00:02:50.290 --> 00:02:54.010 align:middle line:84%
Russia, the United States,
and China, all three countries

00:02:54.010 --> 00:02:57.130 align:middle line:84%
are experimenting with
hypersonic vehicles.

00:02:57.130 --> 00:02:59.140 align:middle line:90%
But that's a big question mark.

00:02:59.140 --> 00:03:01.430 align:middle line:84%
The other possibility
is that-- who knows--

00:03:01.430 --> 00:03:05.420 align:middle line:84%
maybe they are
evidence of visitation.

00:03:05.420 --> 00:03:08.290 align:middle line:84%
>> All this evidence
of visitation,

00:03:08.290 --> 00:03:10.090 align:middle line:90%
what do you think of it?

00:03:10.090 --> 00:03:12.730 align:middle line:84%
>> I think we have to be
open to the possibility.

00:03:12.730 --> 00:03:15.450 align:middle line:84%
Because of the fact that
we have now discovered

00:03:15.450 --> 00:03:19.960 align:middle line:84%
4,000 exoplanets
orbiting other stars.

00:03:19.960 --> 00:03:23.890 align:middle line:84%
On average-- tonight, when you
look in the sky, on average,

00:03:23.890 --> 00:03:28.700 align:middle line:84%
every single star has a
planet going around it.

00:03:28.700 --> 00:03:32.590 align:middle line:84%
And in fact, in the galaxy,
we can now do a census.

00:03:32.590 --> 00:03:36.430 align:middle line:84%
We now realize that there are
over a billion planets that are

00:03:36.430 --> 00:03:39.530 align:middle line:90%
Earth-like in our own backyard.

00:03:39.530 --> 00:03:42.820 align:middle line:84%
So to assume that we
are the only ones,

00:03:42.820 --> 00:03:45.970 align:middle line:84%
I think, is a bit presumptuous,
when there are literally

00:03:45.970 --> 00:03:50.290 align:middle line:84%
billions of Earth-like
planets orbiting other stars.

00:03:50.290 --> 00:03:52.460 align:middle line:90%
That's also a game-changer.

00:03:52.460 --> 00:03:54.550 align:middle line:90%
So I think the tightest turn--

00:03:54.550 --> 00:03:58.210 align:middle line:84%
now people are open to the
idea that, yes, maybe there

00:03:58.210 --> 00:04:00.400 align:middle line:90%
are civilizations in space.

00:04:00.400 --> 00:04:05.200 align:middle line:84%
After all, the universe is
13.8 billion years old--

00:04:05.200 --> 00:04:07.750 align:middle line:90%
13.8 billion years old.

00:04:07.750 --> 00:04:10.100 align:middle line:90%
How old is science?

00:04:10.100 --> 00:04:13.450 align:middle line:90%
Science is 300 years old.

00:04:13.450 --> 00:04:15.610 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, if you consider
from Galileo to now.

00:04:15.610 --> 00:04:16.410 align:middle line:90%
>> That's right.

00:04:16.410 --> 00:04:18.700 align:middle line:84%
300 years ago, we
were all peasants,

00:04:18.700 --> 00:04:22.900 align:middle line:84%
and we believed in books
rather than doing experiments

00:04:22.900 --> 00:04:24.230 align:middle line:90%
on the universe.

00:04:24.230 --> 00:04:26.350 align:middle line:84%
So we have to be
open to technologies

00:04:26.350 --> 00:04:29.260 align:middle line:90%
beyond the conventional realm.

00:04:29.260 --> 00:04:33.580 align:middle line:84%
>> Can we learn from them
if we start to study them?

00:04:33.580 --> 00:04:36.910 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, we physicists
have seriously analyzed

00:04:36.910 --> 00:04:40.250 align:middle line:84%
the possibility of intelligence
throughout the universe.

00:04:40.250 --> 00:04:43.420 align:middle line:84%
How did we become
intelligent, for example?

00:04:43.420 --> 00:04:45.010 align:middle line:90%
We have eyes.

00:04:45.010 --> 00:04:48.850 align:middle line:84%
We have thumbs and
grasping ability.

00:04:48.850 --> 00:04:53.650 align:middle line:84%
And we have a vocabulary, we
have voice, we have language.

00:04:53.650 --> 00:04:57.130 align:middle line:84%
Those are the three
ingredients for intelligence.

00:04:57.130 --> 00:04:59.720 align:middle line:84%
Now, look at the Earth today,
the animals of the planet

00:04:59.720 --> 00:05:00.520 align:middle line:90%
Earth.

00:05:00.520 --> 00:05:03.280 align:middle line:84%
How many of them
have good eyesight,

00:05:03.280 --> 00:05:07.810 align:middle line:84%
opposable thumb or a tentacle,
and a large vocabulary?

00:05:07.810 --> 00:05:09.640 align:middle line:90%
We're the only ones.

00:05:09.640 --> 00:05:12.490 align:middle line:10%
However, in outer
space, Why can't we

00:05:12.490 --> 00:05:14.410 align:middle line:10%
have alien
civilizations that also

00:05:14.410 --> 00:05:17.560 align:middle line:10%
have good eyesight,
good grasping ability,

00:05:17.560 --> 00:05:18.900 align:middle line:10%
and a language?

00:05:18.900 --> 00:05:21.010 align:middle line:84%
That is the
prerequisite to create

00:05:21.010 --> 00:05:23.440 align:middle line:90%
an intelligent civilization.

00:05:23.440 --> 00:05:25.470 align:middle line:84%
>> You mentioned the
number of planets that have

00:05:25.470 --> 00:05:26.990 align:middle line:90%
the possibility.

00:05:26.990 --> 00:05:28.690 align:middle line:84%
According to
National Geographic,

00:05:28.690 --> 00:05:33.820 align:middle line:84%
it could be 40 billion planets
that could be like Earth.

00:05:33.820 --> 00:05:39.260 align:middle line:84%
And these really could harbor
many civilizations out there.

00:05:39.260 --> 00:05:40.060 align:middle line:90%
>> That's right.

00:05:40.060 --> 00:05:44.440 align:middle line:84%
Realize that, since the universe
is 13.8 billion years old,

00:05:44.440 --> 00:05:47.950 align:middle line:84%
civilizations could have
risen and fallen many times

00:05:47.950 --> 00:05:51.550 align:middle line:84%
in the past, and we
wouldn't even know about it.

00:05:51.550 --> 00:05:53.720 align:middle line:90%
That's how primitive we are.

00:05:53.720 --> 00:05:56.050 align:middle line:84%
Now, I have friends
of mine, physicists,

00:05:56.050 --> 00:05:58.990 align:middle line:84%
who search for signals
from outer space,

00:05:58.990 --> 00:06:00.490 align:middle line:90%
but it's very primitive.

00:06:00.490 --> 00:06:02.920 align:middle line:90%
We looked at radio signals.

00:06:02.920 --> 00:06:05.620 align:middle line:84%
But maybe civilizations
don't use radio.

00:06:05.620 --> 00:06:09.190 align:middle line:84%
Maybe for us, radio is
old-fashioned already.

00:06:09.190 --> 00:06:10.935 align:middle line:90%
But that's what we look for.

00:06:10.935 --> 00:06:12.310 align:middle line:84%
And so we realize
that we're just

00:06:12.310 --> 00:06:17.210 align:middle line:84%
beginning to confront the
possibility that there

00:06:17.210 --> 00:06:20.210 align:middle line:84%
are intelligent
civilizations out there.

00:06:20.210 --> 00:06:23.690 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, there are other signs
that have been discovered

00:06:23.690 --> 00:06:28.250 align:middle line:84%
recently, like the Tabby's
star, like these probably huge

00:06:28.250 --> 00:06:30.830 align:middle line:84%
structures around
some other stars.

00:06:30.830 --> 00:06:34.380 align:middle line:84%
It looks like now we have three
different examples of that.

00:06:34.380 --> 00:06:35.180 align:middle line:90%
>> That's right.

00:06:35.180 --> 00:06:38.030 align:middle line:84%
And we have to realize that
civilizations in the future

00:06:38.030 --> 00:06:40.880 align:middle line:84%
could be type 1,
type 2, or type 3.

00:06:40.880 --> 00:06:43.000 align:middle line:90%
They could be type 1, planetary.

00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:44.930 align:middle line:84%
They control the
weather, they control

00:06:44.930 --> 00:06:46.770 align:middle line:90%
volcanoes and the oceans.

00:06:46.770 --> 00:06:48.000 align:middle line:90%
That's type 1.

00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:51.260 align:middle line:84%
Type 2 controls a star,
like which you mentioned.

00:06:51.260 --> 00:06:54.260 align:middle line:84%
Perhaps they can cover
their entire star,

00:06:54.260 --> 00:06:56.390 align:middle line:84%
and use that as
an energy source.

00:06:56.390 --> 00:06:57.680 align:middle line:90%
That's type 2.

00:06:57.680 --> 00:07:01.520 align:middle line:84%
Then there's type 3, a
civilization which is galactic,

00:07:01.520 --> 00:07:04.550 align:middle line:84%
which is several thousand years
more advanced than us, that

00:07:04.550 --> 00:07:07.070 align:middle line:90%
roam the galactic space lanes.

00:07:07.070 --> 00:07:09.590 align:middle line:84%
So if these evidence
of visitation

00:07:09.590 --> 00:07:11.920 align:middle line:84%
is from an extraterrestrial
civilization,

00:07:11.920 --> 00:07:13.580 align:middle line:90%
they could be type 3.

00:07:13.580 --> 00:07:14.960 align:middle line:90%
That is, galactic.

00:07:14.960 --> 00:07:16.640 align:middle line:90%
They play with black holes.

00:07:16.640 --> 00:07:19.430 align:middle line:84%
They roam the
galactic space lanes.

00:07:19.430 --> 00:07:22.310 align:middle line:90%
And they could be eternal.

00:07:22.310 --> 00:07:25.550 align:middle line:84%
>> Immortality is something
that we scientists are looking

00:07:25.550 --> 00:07:29.540 align:middle line:84%
at even today, two types of
immortality that perhaps aliens

00:07:29.540 --> 00:07:30.410 align:middle line:90%
may have.

00:07:30.410 --> 00:07:34.190 align:middle line:84%
One is digital immortality,
to digitize everything

00:07:34.190 --> 00:07:39.020 align:middle line:84%
known about us, to create a copy
of us that is totally digital.

00:07:39.020 --> 00:07:42.140 align:middle line:84%
I would love, for example,
to talk to Einstein.

00:07:42.140 --> 00:07:45.140 align:middle line:84%
Everything known about him
can be digitized-- his books,

00:07:45.140 --> 00:07:47.510 align:middle line:90%
diaries, videotapes, lectures.

00:07:47.510 --> 00:07:49.410 align:middle line:90%
Everything can be digitized.

00:07:49.410 --> 00:07:51.890 align:middle line:84%
I would love an
opportunity to talk to him.

00:07:51.890 --> 00:07:54.560 align:middle line:84%
Then there is
genetic immortality.

00:07:54.560 --> 00:07:58.250 align:middle line:84%
We are now isolating the genes
that control the aging process.

00:07:58.250 --> 00:07:59.450 align:middle line:90%
What is aging?

00:07:59.450 --> 00:08:03.380 align:middle line:84%
Aging is the build up of
errors, mistakes in our DNA

00:08:03.380 --> 00:08:04.950 align:middle line:90%
they build up with time.

00:08:04.950 --> 00:08:06.440 align:middle line:90%
That's why we get old.

00:08:06.440 --> 00:08:08.210 align:middle line:90%
That's why we die.

00:08:08.210 --> 00:08:10.040 align:middle line:84%
But now we have
genetic engineering

00:08:10.040 --> 00:08:13.210 align:middle line:90%
to fix many of these mistakes.

00:08:13.210 --> 00:08:17.150 align:middle line:84%
And so genetic immortality may
be possible, perhaps sometime

00:08:17.150 --> 00:08:19.670 align:middle line:90%
in this century.

00:08:19.670 --> 00:08:26.592 align:middle line:84%
>> And also the Kardashev
is telling us that these--

00:08:26.592 --> 00:08:30.020 align:middle line:84%
how you call it, they call
the levels of society.

00:08:30.020 --> 00:08:33.049 align:middle line:84%
>> Right, the Kardashev
classification.

00:08:33.049 --> 00:08:36.409 align:middle line:84%
>> They mention that probably
the most difficult is to go

00:08:36.409 --> 00:08:42.330 align:middle line:84%
from civilization type 0, like
we are, to civilization type 1,

00:08:42.330 --> 00:08:46.010 align:middle line:84%
especially because of
interest in the oil industry,

00:08:46.010 --> 00:08:48.600 align:middle line:90%
in the oil, in the fossil fuels.

00:08:48.600 --> 00:08:49.400 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:08:49.400 --> 00:08:52.070 align:middle line:10%
We realize that we are type 0.

00:08:52.070 --> 00:08:53.900 align:middle line:90%
We do not play with the weather.

00:08:53.900 --> 00:08:55.430 align:middle line:90%
We don't play with stars.

00:08:55.430 --> 00:08:57.290 align:middle line:90%
We don't play with galaxies.

00:08:57.290 --> 00:09:01.430 align:middle line:84%
We use oil and coal as
our main energy supply.

00:09:01.430 --> 00:09:04.850 align:middle line:84%
But we are about 100 years
from becoming type 1.

00:09:04.850 --> 00:09:06.270 align:middle line:90%
What is the internet?

00:09:06.270 --> 00:09:10.220 align:middle line:10%
The internet is the first
planetary type 1 technology

00:09:10.220 --> 00:09:14.660 align:middle line:10%
to fall into our
century by accident.

00:09:14.660 --> 00:09:18.380 align:middle line:10%
English and Mandarin Chinese
are the two dominant languages

00:09:18.380 --> 00:09:19.220 align:middle line:10%
on the internet.

00:09:19.220 --> 00:09:21.860 align:middle line:84%
Planetary languages
are being formed.

00:09:21.860 --> 00:09:26.120 align:middle line:84%
Planetary sports-- soccer,
football, the Olympics,

00:09:26.120 --> 00:09:27.830 align:middle line:90%
planetary sports.

00:09:27.830 --> 00:09:30.320 align:middle line:90%
Planetary music-- rock and roll.

00:09:30.320 --> 00:09:34.250 align:middle line:84%
Planetary fashion--
Chanel and Gucci.

00:09:34.250 --> 00:09:36.680 align:middle line:84%
So we're beginning to see
the beginning of a planetary

00:09:36.680 --> 00:09:38.780 align:middle line:90%
culture emerging.

00:09:38.780 --> 00:09:42.950 align:middle line:84%
And by 2100, we will become
a planetary civilization.

00:09:42.950 --> 00:09:45.080 align:middle line:84%
But I think that if
we are ever visited

00:09:45.080 --> 00:09:49.590 align:middle line:84%
by another civilization,
they will probably be type 3.

00:09:49.590 --> 00:09:51.180 align:middle line:90%
Now, why do I believe that?

00:09:51.180 --> 00:09:54.650 align:middle line:84%
When you talk to most
scientists about flying saucers,

00:09:54.650 --> 00:09:55.460 align:middle line:90%
they laugh.

00:09:55.460 --> 00:09:56.260 align:middle line:90%
They giggle.

00:09:56.260 --> 00:10:00.980 align:middle line:84%
Because the distances between
stars is so great, they say.

00:10:00.980 --> 00:10:03.860 align:middle line:84%
It would take thousands of years
for them to go from one planet

00:10:03.860 --> 00:10:04.880 align:middle line:90%
to another.

00:10:04.880 --> 00:10:08.030 align:middle line:84%
But you see, that assumes
that they're type 1.

00:10:08.030 --> 00:10:11.360 align:middle line:84%
That assumes that they have
anti-matter, fusion-type

00:10:11.360 --> 00:10:14.060 align:middle line:90%
rockets, very old-fashioned.

00:10:14.060 --> 00:10:16.580 align:middle line:84%
But if they're a few
thousand years ahead of us,

00:10:16.580 --> 00:10:19.730 align:middle line:84%
a million years ahead of us--
that's the blink of an eye

00:10:19.730 --> 00:10:21.680 align:middle line:90%
in the age of the galaxy--

00:10:21.680 --> 00:10:26.820 align:middle line:84%
then perhaps they have new ways
of going across the universe.

00:10:26.820 --> 00:10:29.950 align:middle line:84%
>> That's traveling faster
than the speed of light.

00:10:29.950 --> 00:10:33.050 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, we have something
called the Planck energy

00:10:33.050 --> 00:10:36.680 align:middle line:84%
the Planck energy is the energy
of the stability of space

00:10:36.680 --> 00:10:38.450 align:middle line:90%
and time itself.

00:10:38.450 --> 00:10:41.030 align:middle line:84%
Space and time
become unstable when

00:10:41.030 --> 00:10:43.430 align:middle line:90%
you go to the Planck energy.

00:10:43.430 --> 00:10:46.400 align:middle line:84%
We have, in Geneva, the
Large Hadron Collider.

00:10:46.400 --> 00:10:49.640 align:middle line:84%
The Planck energy is a
quadrillion times greater

00:10:49.640 --> 00:10:51.830 align:middle line:90%
than the Large Hadron Collider.

00:10:51.830 --> 00:10:54.170 align:middle line:84%
And if you could attain
the Planck energy,

00:10:54.170 --> 00:10:56.030 align:middle line:90%
you can create shortcuts--

00:10:56.030 --> 00:10:59.090 align:middle line:84%
perhaps shortcuts
through space and time.

00:10:59.090 --> 00:11:01.400 align:middle line:84%
In other words, go faster
than the speed of light

00:11:01.400 --> 00:11:04.130 align:middle line:90%
using Einstein's own equations.

00:11:04.130 --> 00:11:08.430 align:middle line:84%
>> It means the so-called
wormholes could be a reality?

00:11:08.430 --> 00:11:09.230 align:middle line:90%
>> That's right.

00:11:09.230 --> 00:11:13.460 align:middle line:84%
In 1935, it was Einstein
himself who first introduced

00:11:13.460 --> 00:11:15.400 align:middle line:90%
the concept of the wormhole.

00:11:15.400 --> 00:11:17.350 align:middle line:84%
He took two black
hole solutions,

00:11:17.350 --> 00:11:20.740 align:middle line:84%
stuck them together to create
a gateway between them.

00:11:20.740 --> 00:11:23.770 align:middle line:84%
And that became
the first wormhole.

00:11:23.770 --> 00:11:28.030 align:middle line:84%
And that's like Alice's looking
glass in "Alice in Wonderland."

00:11:28.030 --> 00:11:30.610 align:middle line:10%
When Alice had a looking
glass, and she put her hand

00:11:30.610 --> 00:11:34.960 align:middle line:10%
through the looking glass, her
hand went from Oxford, England,

00:11:34.960 --> 00:11:37.000 align:middle line:10%
to Wonderland.

00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:38.440 align:middle line:90%
That is a wormhole.

00:11:38.440 --> 00:11:41.200 align:middle line:84%
And it is a solution of
Einstein's equations.

00:11:41.200 --> 00:11:43.690 align:middle line:84%
And a type 3 civilization
may have access

00:11:43.690 --> 00:11:45.790 align:middle line:84%
to the Planck energy,
in which case, they

00:11:45.790 --> 00:11:50.182 align:middle line:84%
may be able to use
this as a technology.

00:11:50.182 --> 00:11:55.660 align:middle line:84%
>> In January 20, 2005, there
was a huge solar explosion from

00:11:55.660 --> 00:11:56.950 align:middle line:90%
the sun.

00:11:56.950 --> 00:12:00.520 align:middle line:84%
And the protons-- the
matter from the sun

00:12:00.520 --> 00:12:03.400 align:middle line:84%
came to Earth in
just eight minutes.

00:12:03.400 --> 00:12:08.110 align:middle line:84%
The scientists wonder if
there were some portals

00:12:08.110 --> 00:12:09.820 align:middle line:90%
between the sun and the earth.

00:12:09.820 --> 00:12:13.750 align:middle line:84%
And as we understand,
it was proven by 2008

00:12:13.750 --> 00:12:15.790 align:middle line:90%
that they really existed.

00:12:15.790 --> 00:12:19.670 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, we do know that if the
sun were to explode right now,

00:12:19.670 --> 00:12:22.000 align:middle line:84%
it would take eight minutes
for us to realize that,

00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:25.480 align:middle line:84%
because gravity travels
at the speed of light.

00:12:25.480 --> 00:12:28.390 align:middle line:84%
We know that now we have
gravity wave detectors, first

00:12:28.390 --> 00:12:30.970 align:middle line:90%
predicted by Einstein in 1916.

00:12:30.970 --> 00:12:31.960 align:middle line:90%
We now measure it.

00:12:31.960 --> 00:12:35.540 align:middle line:84%
Gravity travels at
the speed of light.

00:12:35.540 --> 00:12:37.780 align:middle line:84%
Then the question is,
are there anomalies there

00:12:37.780 --> 00:12:40.210 align:middle line:90%
in the fabric of space and time?

00:12:40.210 --> 00:12:43.660 align:middle line:84%
We now know that when light
goes around a galaxy, it bends.

00:12:43.660 --> 00:12:45.080 align:middle line:90%
Light can actually bend.

00:12:45.080 --> 00:12:49.370 align:middle line:84%
Because space itself
bends around a galaxy.

00:12:49.370 --> 00:12:52.630 align:middle line:84%
So space is not
uniform and flat.

00:12:52.630 --> 00:12:55.870 align:middle line:84%
We now know that space and time
is like a river, a river that

00:12:55.870 --> 00:13:00.170 align:middle line:84%
can bend, and twist, and turn
as it goes across the heavens.

00:13:00.170 --> 00:13:04.060 align:middle line:84%
And so we now realize
that Einstein's equations

00:13:04.060 --> 00:13:08.620 align:middle line:84%
had more surprises than
we originally thought.

00:13:08.620 --> 00:13:13.240 align:middle line:84%
>> One of them is this
possibility that it could be

00:13:13.240 --> 00:13:18.320 align:middle line:84%
something else besides
the relativity.

00:13:18.320 --> 00:13:20.230 align:middle line:84%
>> In fact, Einstein
didn't go far enough.

00:13:20.230 --> 00:13:22.300 align:middle line:84%
I work in something called
string theory, where

00:13:22.300 --> 00:13:27.200 align:middle line:84%
we believe in higher dimensions
beyond length, width,

00:13:27.200 --> 00:13:28.480 align:middle line:90%
and height.

00:13:28.480 --> 00:13:30.520 align:middle line:84%
We think of a
three-dimensional world

00:13:30.520 --> 00:13:33.800 align:middle line:84%
where we can move freely
in three dimensions.

00:13:33.800 --> 00:13:37.180 align:middle line:90%
But why not four, five, six?

00:13:37.180 --> 00:13:39.040 align:middle line:90%
Why not hyperspace?

00:13:39.040 --> 00:13:41.110 align:middle line:84%
Well, in physics, we do
believe that there could

00:13:41.110 --> 00:13:44.350 align:middle line:90%
be up to perhaps 11 dimensions.

00:13:44.350 --> 00:13:46.960 align:middle line:84%
I work in something called
string theory, which

00:13:46.960 --> 00:13:49.720 align:middle line:84%
we think will allow us
to have a theory that

00:13:49.720 --> 00:13:52.300 align:middle line:90%
goes beyond Einstein.

00:13:52.300 --> 00:13:56.290 align:middle line:84%
Einstein's equations break down
at the instant of the big bang

00:13:56.290 --> 00:13:58.450 align:middle line:90%
and the center of a black hole.

00:13:58.450 --> 00:14:02.650 align:middle line:84%
To go beyond a black hole, to
go through creation itself,

00:14:02.650 --> 00:14:04.360 align:middle line:90%
requires a higher theory.

00:14:04.360 --> 00:14:05.680 align:middle line:90%
And that's string theory.

00:14:05.680 --> 00:14:07.180 align:middle line:84%
And string theory
says that we could

00:14:07.180 --> 00:14:09.240 align:middle line:84%
exist in a higher
dimension, perhaps

00:14:09.240 --> 00:14:11.660 align:middle line:90%
11-dimensional hyperspace.

00:14:11.660 --> 00:14:12.850 align:middle line:90%
>> Is that possible?

00:14:12.850 --> 00:14:13.870 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, yeah.

00:14:13.870 --> 00:14:16.510 align:middle line:84%
In fact, that's the dominant
theory in theoretical physics,

00:14:16.510 --> 00:14:18.640 align:middle line:84%
that there are other
dimensions out there.

00:14:18.640 --> 00:14:21.940 align:middle line:84%
Something that used to be
considered a crackpot idea

00:14:21.940 --> 00:14:25.360 align:middle line:90%
is now mainstream physics.

00:14:25.360 --> 00:14:27.760 align:middle line:84%
>> This string theory
is your theory.

00:14:27.760 --> 00:14:31.695 align:middle line:84%
I mean, you have become one
of the main experts on this.

00:14:31.695 --> 00:14:33.820 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, I'm one of the
co-founders of string field

00:14:33.820 --> 00:14:36.350 align:middle line:84%
theory, one of the main
branches of string theory.

00:14:36.350 --> 00:14:38.380 align:middle line:84%
And we think that
it is the solution

00:14:38.380 --> 00:14:42.790 align:middle line:84%
to Einstein's famous question--
can we read the mind of God?

00:14:42.790 --> 00:14:45.730 align:middle line:84%
Is there a God
equation, one equation

00:14:45.730 --> 00:14:50.050 align:middle line:84%
that goes beyond relativity,
beyond the quantum theory, that

00:14:50.050 --> 00:14:55.150 align:middle line:84%
unifies everything into one
consistent, coherent theory?

00:14:55.150 --> 00:14:58.260 align:middle line:84%
And we think that
is string theory.

00:14:58.260 --> 00:14:59.260 align:middle line:90%
>> Your last book--

00:14:59.260 --> 00:15:02.500 align:middle line:84%
one of you last books,
"The Future of Humanity,"

00:15:02.500 --> 00:15:04.210 align:middle line:84%
can you tell us
about that, please?

00:15:04.210 --> 00:15:05.110 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:15:05.110 --> 00:15:06.940 align:middle line:84%
We now realize
that, perhaps, when

00:15:06.940 --> 00:15:12.190 align:middle line:84%
we become a type 1 civilization,
we will go to the stars.

00:15:12.190 --> 00:15:15.880 align:middle line:84%
We will have fusion engines,
maybe antimatter engines,

00:15:15.880 --> 00:15:18.100 align:middle line:84%
with the ability to go
to the nearby stars.

00:15:18.100 --> 00:15:22.570 align:middle line:84%
But that's just 10, 20 light
years from the planet Earth.

00:15:22.570 --> 00:15:24.250 align:middle line:10%
But I think, in
the next century,

00:15:24.250 --> 00:15:26.380 align:middle line:10%
we will have the
first starships.

00:15:26.380 --> 00:15:29.160 align:middle line:84%
Now, once we become
type 2, then there's

00:15:29.160 --> 00:15:34.130 align:middle line:84%
a possibility of going beyond,
into the galaxy itself.

00:15:34.130 --> 00:15:37.270 align:middle line:84%
And I think it's inevitable
that we will have to do this.

00:15:37.270 --> 00:15:42.130 align:middle line:84%
You see, the dinosaurs did
not have a space program.

00:15:42.130 --> 00:15:43.660 align:middle line:84%
That's why they're
not here today.

00:15:43.660 --> 00:15:45.790 align:middle line:84%
How come there are no
dinosaurs here today?

00:15:45.790 --> 00:15:47.680 align:middle line:90%
They had no space program.

00:15:47.680 --> 00:15:51.610 align:middle line:84%
We have a space program, which
means we need an insurance

00:15:51.610 --> 00:15:55.240 align:middle line:84%
policy, plan B. Just
in case something bad

00:15:55.240 --> 00:15:58.600 align:middle line:84%
happens on the planet Earth,
it's good to have a settlement.

00:15:58.600 --> 00:16:01.480 align:middle line:84%
And we will be on the
moon starting next year.

00:16:01.480 --> 00:16:04.600 align:middle line:84%
We're going to orbit the moon
with the SLS booster rocket.

00:16:04.600 --> 00:16:08.740 align:middle line:84%
By mid-decade, we'll be on
the moon, and by 15 years,

00:16:08.740 --> 00:16:10.580 align:middle line:90%
we hope to be on Mars.

00:16:10.580 --> 00:16:13.880 align:middle line:84%
And so that's just the beginning
of a type 1 civilization.

00:16:13.880 --> 00:16:16.540 align:middle line:84%
And imagine by the
time we're type 2,

00:16:16.540 --> 00:16:19.150 align:middle line:84%
we will have colonized
the entire solar system,

00:16:19.150 --> 00:16:22.610 align:middle line:84%
and even beyond to
nearby solar systems.

00:16:22.610 --> 00:16:25.490 align:middle line:84%
>> What are the challenges
to colonize Mars?

00:16:25.490 --> 00:16:27.350 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, one of the
problems is cost.

00:16:27.350 --> 00:16:29.350 align:middle line:90%
But costs are dropping.

00:16:29.350 --> 00:16:32.500 align:middle line:84%
For example, if you take
a car ride from your home

00:16:32.500 --> 00:16:35.480 align:middle line:84%
to work, and then
you junk your car,

00:16:35.480 --> 00:16:39.340 align:middle line:84%
cars would be very
expensive-- one ride, one car.

00:16:39.340 --> 00:16:41.650 align:middle line:90%
That's rocketry today.

00:16:41.650 --> 00:16:44.320 align:middle line:84%
We only use rockets
once, just once.

00:16:44.320 --> 00:16:45.400 align:middle line:90%
We junk them.

00:16:45.400 --> 00:16:47.630 align:middle line:90%
What a waste of money.

00:16:47.630 --> 00:16:49.300 align:middle line:90%
That's why we reuse cars.

00:16:49.300 --> 00:16:52.870 align:middle line:84%
And now reusable rockets
are coming into play.

00:16:52.870 --> 00:16:56.710 align:middle line:84%
It costs $10,000 to
put a pound of anything

00:16:56.710 --> 00:16:59.050 align:middle line:84%
in orbit around
the planet Earth.

00:16:59.050 --> 00:17:00.055 align:middle line:90%
Take a book.

00:17:00.055 --> 00:17:02.010 align:middle line:90%
It weighs about a pound.

00:17:02.010 --> 00:17:04.970 align:middle line:84%
Put it in outer space,
how much does it cost?

00:17:04.970 --> 00:17:07.099 align:middle line:90%
$10,000 a pound.

00:17:07.099 --> 00:17:09.339 align:middle line:90%
Now, that's your weight in gold.

00:17:09.339 --> 00:17:12.069 align:middle line:84%
Think of your body
made out of gold.

00:17:12.069 --> 00:17:16.150 align:middle line:84%
That's what it costs to put
you in orbit around the Earth.

00:17:16.150 --> 00:17:19.329 align:middle line:84%
To go to the moon is
about $100,000 a pound.

00:17:19.329 --> 00:17:23.599 align:middle line:84%
To put you on Mars is about
a million dollars a pound.

00:17:23.599 --> 00:17:26.859 align:middle line:84%
But once we have
reusable rockets,

00:17:26.859 --> 00:17:30.220 align:middle line:84%
once we decrease the
cost of space travel,

00:17:30.220 --> 00:17:33.010 align:middle line:84%
then perhaps these costs
will drop to the point

00:17:33.010 --> 00:17:36.070 align:middle line:84%
where families can
go into outer space.

00:17:36.070 --> 00:17:41.063 align:middle line:84%
I believe that our grandkids,
they may honeymoon on the moon.

00:17:41.063 --> 00:17:42.730 align:middle line:84%
They may consider the
moon a great place

00:17:42.730 --> 00:17:44.230 align:middle line:90%
to have a honeymoon.

00:17:44.230 --> 00:17:47.090 align:middle line:84%
And on Mars-- yeah, by
the end of this century,

00:17:47.090 --> 00:17:50.020 align:middle line:84%
we will have a permanent
settlement on Mars.

00:17:50.020 --> 00:17:53.380 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, they are planning to
have our hotel around the Earth

00:17:53.380 --> 00:17:54.520 align:middle line:90%
by 2025.

00:17:54.520 --> 00:17:55.400 align:middle line:90%
Is that possible?

00:17:55.400 --> 00:17:56.200 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, yeah.

00:17:56.200 --> 00:17:56.800 align:middle line:90%
It's possible.

00:17:56.800 --> 00:17:57.908 align:middle line:90%
It's a question of cost.

00:17:57.908 --> 00:17:59.200 align:middle line:90%
We have to bring the cost down.

00:17:59.200 --> 00:18:00.490 align:middle line:90%
It's an engineering problem.

00:18:00.490 --> 00:18:04.000 align:middle line:84%
The basic physics was worked
out during World War II.

00:18:04.000 --> 00:18:06.670 align:middle line:84%
So it's a question of
engineering and cost

00:18:06.670 --> 00:18:10.650 align:middle line:84%
to make it safe, and make it
affordable for mom and dad.

00:18:10.650 --> 00:18:14.590 align:middle line:84%
>> And is the moon
going to be habitable?

00:18:14.590 --> 00:18:16.010 align:middle line:90%
>> Well, in principle, yes.

00:18:16.010 --> 00:18:18.460 align:middle line:84%
But there's not much
on the moon that we

00:18:18.460 --> 00:18:20.860 align:middle line:90%
can use to live off the land.

00:18:20.860 --> 00:18:24.370 align:middle line:84%
You see, the early pioneers
were able to live off the land.

00:18:24.370 --> 00:18:26.110 align:middle line:90%
They could plant crops.

00:18:26.110 --> 00:18:27.402 align:middle line:90%
They could shoot game.

00:18:27.402 --> 00:18:28.610 align:middle line:90%
They could live off the land.

00:18:28.610 --> 00:18:29.943 align:middle line:90%
They didn't have to bring water.

00:18:29.943 --> 00:18:31.510 align:middle line:90%
They didn't have to bring air.

00:18:31.510 --> 00:18:33.460 align:middle line:84%
They didn't have to
bring soil with them

00:18:33.460 --> 00:18:35.260 align:middle line:90%
when they came to a new world.

00:18:35.260 --> 00:18:37.220 align:middle line:90%
On Mars, we do.

00:18:37.220 --> 00:18:40.480 align:middle line:84%
So we have to create a
self-sustaining colony.

00:18:40.480 --> 00:18:44.380 align:middle line:84%
One way to do this is to have
satellites go around Mars

00:18:44.380 --> 00:18:46.600 align:middle line:90%
to heat up the ice caps.

00:18:46.600 --> 00:18:48.850 align:middle line:84%
The ice caps have
plenty of water.

00:18:48.850 --> 00:18:52.480 align:middle line:84%
Mars once had oceans,
rivers, lakes,

00:18:52.480 --> 00:18:55.060 align:middle line:84%
almost a tropical
environment, practically.

00:18:55.060 --> 00:18:58.420 align:middle line:84%
By beaming energy from
the sun onto the icecaps,

00:18:58.420 --> 00:19:01.510 align:middle line:84%
we can melt the
ice caps, and water

00:19:01.510 --> 00:19:04.270 align:middle line:90%
will flow on Mars once again.

00:19:04.270 --> 00:19:05.470 align:middle line:90%
>> What happened in Mars?

00:19:05.470 --> 00:19:06.430 align:middle line:90%
What happened?

00:19:06.430 --> 00:19:10.060 align:middle line:84%
They say now that it was like
some billions of years ago.

00:19:10.060 --> 00:19:12.550 align:middle line:84%
>> In fact, Mars was
tropical before the Earth.

00:19:12.550 --> 00:19:14.860 align:middle line:84%
Mars cooled off
before the Earth.

00:19:14.860 --> 00:19:18.790 align:middle line:84%
Some people think that maybe
DNA got off the ground on Mars

00:19:18.790 --> 00:19:20.800 align:middle line:84%
first, because it
cooled off first.

00:19:20.800 --> 00:19:23.080 align:middle line:90%
>> We are martians probably.

00:19:23.080 --> 00:19:25.180 align:middle line:90%
>> We are the Martians, right?

00:19:25.180 --> 00:19:27.080 align:middle line:84%
So what we have to
do is several things.

00:19:27.080 --> 00:19:29.750 align:middle line:84%
First of all, once we're on
Mars, we have to have energy.

00:19:29.750 --> 00:19:31.300 align:middle line:90%
We'll get that from sunlight.

00:19:31.300 --> 00:19:33.940 align:middle line:84%
We have to create
genetically modified

00:19:33.940 --> 00:19:40.060 align:middle line:84%
algae to thrive in a carbon
dioxide cold environment.

00:19:40.060 --> 00:19:42.920 align:middle line:84%
So genetically
engineered plants,

00:19:42.920 --> 00:19:46.930 align:middle line:84%
algae, to thrive in this
environment of the planet Mars,

00:19:46.930 --> 00:19:49.660 align:middle line:90%
to create crops so we can eat.

00:19:49.660 --> 00:19:50.930 align:middle line:90%
>> Like in "The Martian"?

00:19:50.930 --> 00:19:53.200 align:middle line:84%
>> Like in the movie,
"The Martian," right.

00:19:53.200 --> 00:19:54.370 align:middle line:90%
>> Is that possible?

00:19:54.370 --> 00:19:55.760 align:middle line:90%
Are we going to do it?

00:19:55.760 --> 00:19:59.890 align:middle line:84%
Are you looking at Mars as the
next house for human beings?

00:19:59.890 --> 00:20:01.060 align:middle line:90%
>> It's definitely possible.

00:20:01.060 --> 00:20:03.610 align:middle line:84%
However, cost, again, is
going to be a problem.

00:20:03.610 --> 00:20:06.850 align:middle line:84%
One of the things about
cost is that the asteroids

00:20:06.850 --> 00:20:10.000 align:middle line:84%
may be the stepping
stone for colonization.

00:20:10.000 --> 00:20:13.510 align:middle line:84%
For example, years ago,
when Thomas Jefferson

00:20:13.510 --> 00:20:18.610 align:middle line:84%
negotiated with Napoleon
to buy the mid half of what

00:20:18.610 --> 00:20:22.900 align:middle line:84%
became the United
States, Thomas Jefferson

00:20:22.900 --> 00:20:24.940 align:middle line:84%
thought that it would
take 1,000 years--

00:20:24.940 --> 00:20:29.290 align:middle line:84%
1,000 years to
colonize the Midwest.

00:20:29.290 --> 00:20:30.880 align:middle line:90%
It took a few decades.

00:20:30.880 --> 00:20:32.290 align:middle line:90%
Why?

00:20:32.290 --> 00:20:33.670 align:middle line:90%
The Gold Rush.

00:20:33.670 --> 00:20:37.730 align:middle line:84%
In 1848, gold was
discovered in California,

00:20:37.730 --> 00:20:40.030 align:middle line:84%
and instead of
taking 1,000 years

00:20:40.030 --> 00:20:43.840 align:middle line:84%
to colonize the United States,
it took us a few decades.

00:20:43.840 --> 00:20:46.180 align:middle line:84%
There's a new gold
rush because asteroids

00:20:46.180 --> 00:20:50.650 align:middle line:84%
have platinum and rare earth
elements in large quantities.

00:20:50.650 --> 00:20:53.500 align:middle line:84%
You see, when the Earth was
molten billions of years ago,

00:20:53.500 --> 00:20:57.610 align:middle line:84%
many of the rare elements sunk
to the center of the Earth.

00:20:57.610 --> 00:21:00.700 align:middle line:84%
So the crust does not have too
much of these very valuable

00:21:00.700 --> 00:21:01.620 align:middle line:90%
elements.

00:21:01.620 --> 00:21:03.700 align:middle line:90%
Asteroids never had that.

00:21:03.700 --> 00:21:06.250 align:middle line:84%
Therefore, asteroids
have more platinum,

00:21:06.250 --> 00:21:09.940 align:middle line:84%
more rare earth elements that
are commercially valuable.

00:21:09.940 --> 00:21:13.510 align:middle line:84%
One large asteroid can
pay for space program.

00:21:13.510 --> 00:21:14.310 align:middle line:90%
>> Really?

00:21:14.310 --> 00:21:15.110 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:21:15.110 --> 00:21:17.740 align:middle line:84%
That's how much platinum-based
materials and rare earth

00:21:17.740 --> 00:21:18.540 align:middle line:90%
there are.

00:21:18.540 --> 00:21:21.760 align:middle line:84%
>> I even heard that there
was one asteroid with gold.

00:21:21.760 --> 00:21:22.940 align:middle line:90%
It was made of gold.

00:21:22.940 --> 00:21:23.790 align:middle line:90%
Is that true?

00:21:23.790 --> 00:21:24.590 align:middle line:90%
>> Well, possibly.

00:21:24.590 --> 00:21:26.930 align:middle line:84%
We have a planet in
outer space that we

00:21:26.930 --> 00:21:28.820 align:middle line:90%
discovered that has diamonds.

00:21:28.820 --> 00:21:31.340 align:middle line:84%
It turns out that
carbon is in very hot

00:21:31.340 --> 00:21:35.510 align:middle line:84%
form sufficient to create a
planet made out of diamonds.

00:21:35.510 --> 00:21:36.800 align:middle line:90%
>> However it's far away.

00:21:36.800 --> 00:21:38.650 align:middle line:90%
>> Very far away, right?

00:21:38.650 --> 00:21:42.650 align:middle line:84%
>> Do you think, then, the
future of humanity is safe?

00:21:42.650 --> 00:21:45.830 align:middle line:84%
Because now we are looking
to the climate change,

00:21:45.830 --> 00:21:54.110 align:middle line:84%
we are looking to the population
growth, the scarce quantity

00:21:54.110 --> 00:21:56.760 align:middle line:90%
of food, the elements.

00:21:56.760 --> 00:21:59.840 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, I don't think we should
go to Mars and the universe

00:21:59.840 --> 00:22:02.570 align:middle line:84%
to escape the problems
of the planet Earth.

00:22:02.570 --> 00:22:04.100 align:middle line:90%
We are earthlings.

00:22:04.100 --> 00:22:05.720 align:middle line:10%
This is going to
be our home planet

00:22:05.720 --> 00:22:07.530 align:middle line:10%
for many thousands of years.

00:22:07.530 --> 00:22:10.970 align:middle line:84%
So we have to use our own
intelligence on the earth

00:22:10.970 --> 00:22:13.250 align:middle line:90%
to solve Earth-like problems.

00:22:13.250 --> 00:22:16.380 align:middle line:84%
I think we should go to
Mars as an insurance policy,

00:22:16.380 --> 00:22:19.310 align:middle line:84%
to spread our wings,
to see what's out there

00:22:19.310 --> 00:22:22.790 align:middle line:84%
in the universe, not necessarily
to settle the entire universe--

00:22:22.790 --> 00:22:24.990 align:middle line:84%
that would be very,
very expensive--

00:22:24.990 --> 00:22:28.070 align:middle line:84%
but to begin the
process of creating

00:22:28.070 --> 00:22:29.810 align:middle line:90%
a settlement on another world.

00:22:29.810 --> 00:22:31.610 align:middle line:84%
>> Are you optimistic
about this?

00:22:31.610 --> 00:22:36.830 align:middle line:84%
I mean, will human being learn
about all these mistakes,

00:22:36.830 --> 00:22:39.448 align:middle line:84%
and solve the problems
in the future?

00:22:39.448 --> 00:22:40.490 align:middle line:90%
>> Well, I would hope so.

00:22:40.490 --> 00:22:42.710 align:middle line:84%
You mentioned
overpopulation, right?

00:22:42.710 --> 00:22:46.100 align:middle line:10%
We realize that, every
few years, United Nations

00:22:46.100 --> 00:22:48.650 align:middle line:10%
projects the population
of the future.

00:22:48.650 --> 00:22:52.800 align:middle line:10%
And it gets more and more
reasonable every year.

00:22:52.800 --> 00:22:53.600 align:middle line:90%
Why?

00:22:53.600 --> 00:22:57.680 align:middle line:84%
Because when nations
get old, like Japan,

00:22:57.680 --> 00:22:59.450 align:middle line:90%
they have fewer children.

00:22:59.450 --> 00:23:03.140 align:middle line:84%
The population of Japan
is contracting now.

00:23:03.140 --> 00:23:06.770 align:middle line:84%
By mid-century, it'll lose
about a million people per year

00:23:06.770 --> 00:23:09.860 align:middle line:84%
according to the latest
projections in Japan.

00:23:09.860 --> 00:23:11.180 align:middle line:90%
Europe is next.

00:23:11.180 --> 00:23:14.840 align:middle line:84%
Germany, Austria,
Switzerland-- populations

00:23:14.840 --> 00:23:18.450 align:middle line:84%
are not growing as fast
as we once projected.

00:23:18.450 --> 00:23:19.250 align:middle line:90%
Why?

00:23:19.250 --> 00:23:20.660 align:middle line:90%
Because people are richer.

00:23:20.660 --> 00:23:22.490 align:middle line:84%
When you're richer,
you live longer,

00:23:22.490 --> 00:23:24.060 align:middle line:90%
you have fewer children.

00:23:24.060 --> 00:23:27.390 align:middle line:84%
And so the population explosion
never happened in Japan.

00:23:27.390 --> 00:23:28.760 align:middle line:90%
And it's going backwards.

00:23:28.760 --> 00:23:31.490 align:middle line:84%
China is beginning to
experience the same problem.

00:23:31.490 --> 00:23:35.360 align:middle line:84%
So overpopulation is a
problem, but it's not as big

00:23:35.360 --> 00:23:37.730 align:middle line:90%
as we thought.

00:23:37.730 --> 00:23:40.250 align:middle line:84%
>> And what about
the climate change?

00:23:40.250 --> 00:23:42.860 align:middle line:84%
What about the fossil
fuels and the burning?

00:23:42.860 --> 00:23:45.320 align:middle line:84%
Now are very rewarded
because the whole world

00:23:45.320 --> 00:23:47.690 align:middle line:90%
seems to be in flames.

00:23:47.690 --> 00:23:49.430 align:middle line:90%
>> Global warming is real.

00:23:49.430 --> 00:23:50.900 align:middle line:90%
It's not science fiction.

00:23:50.900 --> 00:23:52.550 align:middle line:90%
We measure with our satellites.

00:23:52.550 --> 00:23:54.830 align:middle line:84%
Every glacier is
receding on the planet

00:23:54.830 --> 00:23:56.570 align:middle line:90%
Earth, every major glacier.

00:23:56.570 --> 00:23:58.700 align:middle line:84%
All the indicators
are pointing up--

00:23:58.700 --> 00:24:04.070 align:middle line:84%
more forest fires, more
floods, more extreme weather.

00:24:04.070 --> 00:24:06.170 align:middle line:90%
All the indicators point up.

00:24:06.170 --> 00:24:07.760 align:middle line:90%
But there is some good news.

00:24:07.760 --> 00:24:11.990 align:middle line:84%
Why don't we have solar power
and wind power everywhere?

00:24:11.990 --> 00:24:14.900 align:middle line:84%
We've made inroads, especially
in Europe, with wind power.

00:24:14.900 --> 00:24:19.670 align:middle line:84%
But why don't we have all of it
with sun power and wind power?

00:24:19.670 --> 00:24:22.520 align:middle line:84%
The problem is
not wind or solar.

00:24:22.520 --> 00:24:25.040 align:middle line:90%
The problem is storage.

00:24:25.040 --> 00:24:27.770 align:middle line:84%
Everyone forgets
this-- the battery.

00:24:27.770 --> 00:24:30.320 align:middle line:84%
The battery does not
obey Moore's law.

00:24:30.320 --> 00:24:33.270 align:middle line:84%
Moore's Law says computers
double in power every 18

00:24:33.270 --> 00:24:34.070 align:middle line:90%
months.

00:24:34.070 --> 00:24:35.480 align:middle line:90%
That's computers.

00:24:35.480 --> 00:24:38.630 align:middle line:84%
Solar cells do
not become cheaper

00:24:38.630 --> 00:24:40.880 align:middle line:90%
by half every 18 months.

00:24:40.880 --> 00:24:44.600 align:middle line:84%
But now inventors are
creating the superbattery,

00:24:44.600 --> 00:24:48.740 align:middle line:84%
superbatteries that can
make power generation when

00:24:48.740 --> 00:24:51.740 align:middle line:84%
the sun doesn't shine
and the winds don't blow.

00:24:51.740 --> 00:24:55.610 align:middle line:84%
That could easily double the
efficiency of solar and wind.

00:24:55.610 --> 00:24:57.890 align:middle line:84%
And so now inventors
are concentrating

00:24:57.890 --> 00:25:01.160 align:middle line:84%
on creating batteries which
can store this energy when

00:25:01.160 --> 00:25:03.770 align:middle line:84%
the sun doesn't shine
and the winds don't blow.

00:25:03.770 --> 00:25:08.720 align:middle line:84%
Plus, on a scale now of decades,
fusion power is a possibility.

00:25:08.720 --> 00:25:11.180 align:middle line:84%
In southern France,
Cadarache, France,

00:25:11.180 --> 00:25:15.530 align:middle line:84%
the European Union is betting
on the ITER hydrogen fusion

00:25:15.530 --> 00:25:16.850 align:middle line:90%
reactor.

00:25:16.850 --> 00:25:23.000 align:middle line:84%
That would mean that, one day,
seawater would give us energy

00:25:23.000 --> 00:25:24.220 align:middle line:90%
forever.

00:25:24.220 --> 00:25:25.950 align:middle line:90%
>> And the batteries?

00:25:25.950 --> 00:25:27.580 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, so the
batteries are coming.

00:25:27.580 --> 00:25:31.640 align:middle line:84%
Realize that battery efficiency
is increasing every year.

00:25:31.640 --> 00:25:35.270 align:middle line:84%
Prices for batteries have
dropped, efficiency is up.

00:25:35.270 --> 00:25:37.190 align:middle line:84%
And it means that with
superbatteries, we'll

00:25:37.190 --> 00:25:39.590 align:middle line:84%
be able to even out
the energy cycle.

00:25:39.590 --> 00:25:41.360 align:middle line:84%
For example, utilities
have to prepare

00:25:41.360 --> 00:25:43.760 align:middle line:90%
for peak summer, peak winter.

00:25:43.760 --> 00:25:45.200 align:middle line:90%
That's when people want power--

00:25:45.200 --> 00:25:47.490 align:middle line:90%
peak winter, peak summer.

00:25:47.490 --> 00:25:50.690 align:middle line:84%
And you cannot store
electrical energy very well.

00:25:50.690 --> 00:25:54.320 align:middle line:84%
With a superbattery, you can
even out the energy cycle.

00:25:54.320 --> 00:25:56.240 align:middle line:84%
So the energy cycle
does not look like this,

00:25:56.240 --> 00:25:57.890 align:middle line:90%
it becomes much flatter.

00:25:57.890 --> 00:26:01.490 align:middle line:84%
And you can save a tremendous
amount of money with utilities.

00:26:01.490 --> 00:26:05.840 align:middle line:84%
So the utilities are very much
interested in the superbattery.

00:26:05.840 --> 00:26:09.560 align:middle line:90%
>> And what about trash?

00:26:09.560 --> 00:26:11.070 align:middle line:90%
What about plastics?

00:26:11.070 --> 00:26:13.020 align:middle line:90%
What about plastics on the sea?

00:26:13.020 --> 00:26:14.970 align:middle line:90%
Do you see any solution there?

00:26:14.970 --> 00:26:18.990 align:middle line:84%
Are we going to leave these
behind for other generations?

00:26:18.990 --> 00:26:22.230 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, I think we should,
one, pass legislation so that

00:26:22.230 --> 00:26:26.010 align:middle line:84%
nations have to be responsible
for the garbage they create.

00:26:26.010 --> 00:26:29.160 align:middle line:84%
But two, let market
forces kick into play,

00:26:29.160 --> 00:26:33.390 align:middle line:84%
that objects should include
the price of disposal.

00:26:33.390 --> 00:26:35.340 align:middle line:84%
When you buy
something, you're not

00:26:35.340 --> 00:26:36.990 align:middle line:84%
paying for the
price for disposal.

00:26:36.990 --> 00:26:38.990 align:middle line:84%
You're just paying for
the manufacturing cost.

00:26:38.990 --> 00:26:39.790 align:middle line:90%
>> Exactly.

00:26:39.790 --> 00:26:40.590 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:26:40.590 --> 00:26:43.470 align:middle line:84%
So we may have to
tax certain products,

00:26:43.470 --> 00:26:45.450 align:middle line:84%
so that we can,
from the tax money,

00:26:45.450 --> 00:26:48.210 align:middle line:90%
pay for the cleanup operation.

00:26:48.210 --> 00:26:51.150 align:middle line:84%
And that would
allow market forces

00:26:51.150 --> 00:26:53.580 align:middle line:90%
to drive down the cost of waste.

00:26:53.580 --> 00:26:54.860 align:middle line:90%
>> Recycle?

00:26:54.860 --> 00:26:57.420 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, recycling,
government regulation,

00:26:57.420 --> 00:27:00.360 align:middle line:84%
plus the market
forces, by taxing,

00:27:00.360 --> 00:27:04.680 align:middle line:84%
by putting more taxes to
include the cost of disposal.

00:27:04.680 --> 00:27:07.530 align:middle line:84%
>> What about the
conscience of the people?

00:27:07.530 --> 00:27:09.250 align:middle line:90%
>> Well, that's a slow process.

00:27:09.250 --> 00:27:12.480 align:middle line:84%
You see, democracies do not
work in a straight line.

00:27:12.480 --> 00:27:15.120 align:middle line:84%
Democracies depend upon
an educated population.

00:27:15.120 --> 00:27:17.490 align:middle line:84%
And it takes time
to educate people.

00:27:17.490 --> 00:27:18.990 align:middle line:90%
It takes time and effort.

00:27:18.990 --> 00:27:20.220 align:middle line:90%
But I think it's happening.

00:27:20.220 --> 00:27:23.350 align:middle line:84%
I think people are aware that
global warming is a problem.

00:27:23.350 --> 00:27:25.230 align:middle line:84%
They are aware that we
have limited resources

00:27:25.230 --> 00:27:26.430 align:middle line:90%
on the planet Earth.

00:27:26.430 --> 00:27:28.905 align:middle line:84%
I think that things
have changed.

00:27:28.905 --> 00:27:33.780 align:middle line:84%
>> And what about something
that really worries us,

00:27:33.780 --> 00:27:36.180 align:middle line:90%
that is the extinction of life--

00:27:36.180 --> 00:27:38.340 align:middle line:90%
I mean, animals and species.

00:27:38.340 --> 00:27:40.140 align:middle line:84%
What is happening
around the world?

00:27:40.140 --> 00:27:43.860 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, many people
believe that, in the past,

00:27:43.860 --> 00:27:48.030 align:middle line:84%
perhaps there was a comet or a
meteor that wiped out diversity

00:27:48.030 --> 00:27:49.440 align:middle line:90%
on the planet Earth.

00:27:49.440 --> 00:27:52.350 align:middle line:10%
Some people think
that a new comet has

00:27:52.350 --> 00:27:54.860 align:middle line:10%
hit the earth, called humans.

00:27:54.860 --> 00:27:58.350 align:middle line:84%
That is, you and me,
we are the new comet

00:27:58.350 --> 00:28:00.090 align:middle line:90%
that has hit the earth.

00:28:00.090 --> 00:28:03.990 align:middle line:84%
And it means that life forms
are disappearing on the planet.

00:28:03.990 --> 00:28:05.910 align:middle line:84%
Now, that's very
dangerous, because we are

00:28:05.910 --> 00:28:07.790 align:middle line:90%
at the top of the food chain.

00:28:07.790 --> 00:28:10.110 align:middle line:84%
Here is the food chain,
starting with the oceans,

00:28:10.110 --> 00:28:12.240 align:middle line:90%
going all the way to the top.

00:28:12.240 --> 00:28:13.170 align:middle line:90%
We're at the very top.

00:28:13.170 --> 00:28:16.290 align:middle line:84%
Now, if the food chain
were destabilized,

00:28:16.290 --> 00:28:20.010 align:middle line:84%
it wouldn't take much for us
to fall off the food chain.

00:28:20.010 --> 00:28:22.380 align:middle line:84%
For example, look
at cereal crops.

00:28:22.380 --> 00:28:24.600 align:middle line:90%
How many cereals do we eat?

00:28:24.600 --> 00:28:28.440 align:middle line:84%
Corn, wheat, rye,
just a handful.

00:28:28.440 --> 00:28:30.630 align:middle line:84%
But if there is a
disease, a blight,

00:28:30.630 --> 00:28:33.420 align:middle line:84%
which affects corn
or wheat, you're

00:28:33.420 --> 00:28:35.580 align:middle line:90%
talking about mass starvation.

00:28:35.580 --> 00:28:38.710 align:middle line:84%
A rice blight could
affect all of Asia.

00:28:38.710 --> 00:28:42.420 align:middle line:84%
So we are so dependent
upon just a few crops

00:28:42.420 --> 00:28:45.010 align:middle line:84%
because we are at the
top of the food chain.

00:28:45.010 --> 00:28:49.050 align:middle line:84%
So we have to be more careful
about the world around us

00:28:49.050 --> 00:28:50.720 align:middle line:90%
that we pollute.

00:28:50.720 --> 00:28:53.080 align:middle line:84%
>> You talk about a
comet and meteorites.

00:28:53.080 --> 00:28:56.520 align:middle line:84%
Just recently we
have found that there

00:28:56.520 --> 00:29:00.930 align:middle line:84%
were many different asteroids
coming to Earth, just

00:29:00.930 --> 00:29:05.530 align:middle line:84%
in the last month, two
months, July and August.

00:29:05.530 --> 00:29:09.870 align:middle line:84%
Now the European
Space Agency and NASA

00:29:09.870 --> 00:29:12.320 align:middle line:84%
are talking about
joining efforts

00:29:12.320 --> 00:29:14.790 align:middle line:90%
to do something about it.

00:29:14.790 --> 00:29:17.460 align:middle line:90%
Are we in really a real danger?

00:29:17.460 --> 00:29:19.710 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, not in any
immediate danger.

00:29:19.710 --> 00:29:22.620 align:middle line:84%
However, we have to realize
that the threat is real.

00:29:22.620 --> 00:29:24.450 align:middle line:84%
We now realize that,
when rocks come

00:29:24.450 --> 00:29:27.390 align:middle line:84%
in from outer space, deep
space, they hit the earth,

00:29:27.390 --> 00:29:31.200 align:middle line:84%
sometimes they explode with
the power of an atomic bomb.

00:29:31.200 --> 00:29:34.080 align:middle line:84%
Now, we didn't know this,
because we don't register--

00:29:34.080 --> 00:29:35.610 align:middle line:84%
we don't measure
things happening

00:29:35.610 --> 00:29:37.800 align:middle line:90%
way up there in outer space.

00:29:37.800 --> 00:29:39.190 align:middle line:90%
But now we do.

00:29:39.190 --> 00:29:41.060 align:middle line:84%
And we found what
are called bolides.

00:29:41.060 --> 00:29:46.350 align:middle line:84%
Bolides are rocks that explode
way up in the upper atmosphere.

00:29:46.350 --> 00:29:49.900 align:middle line:84%
And they explode with the
power of an atomic bomb.

00:29:49.900 --> 00:29:51.712 align:middle line:90%
So this is serious.

00:29:51.712 --> 00:29:53.670 align:middle line:84%
Now, they don't reach
the surface of the earth,

00:29:53.670 --> 00:29:56.160 align:middle line:84%
because they vaporize
way up in space.

00:29:56.160 --> 00:29:59.080 align:middle line:84%
But it means that they're
more common than we thought.

00:29:59.080 --> 00:30:03.600 align:middle line:84%
Now, Near-Earth Object,
NEO, Near-Earth Objects,

00:30:03.600 --> 00:30:05.830 align:middle line:84%
we now realize that there
are thousands of them.

00:30:05.830 --> 00:30:07.280 align:middle line:90%
And we track them.

00:30:07.280 --> 00:30:09.930 align:middle line:84%
The military tracks
all these thousands

00:30:09.930 --> 00:30:13.490 align:middle line:84%
of Near-Earth Objects, but
we don't get all of them.

00:30:13.490 --> 00:30:17.400 align:middle line:84%
And we basically look at them
larger than a soccer field.

00:30:17.400 --> 00:30:20.650 align:middle line:84%
If an object is larger
than a football field,

00:30:20.650 --> 00:30:21.660 align:middle line:90%
we can monitor it.

00:30:21.660 --> 00:30:25.860 align:middle line:84%
Smaller than a football
field, we don't, which

00:30:25.860 --> 00:30:29.850 align:middle line:84%
means that there could be
thousands of objects that

00:30:29.850 --> 00:30:32.100 align:middle line:84%
are the size of an
apartment building

00:30:32.100 --> 00:30:36.240 align:middle line:84%
that could hit the earth
and destroy an entire city.

00:30:36.240 --> 00:30:39.780 align:middle line:84%
Now, a city-buster that
could hit the earth

00:30:39.780 --> 00:30:42.800 align:middle line:84%
and wipe out London,
New York, or Moscow,

00:30:42.800 --> 00:30:45.570 align:middle line:84%
hits the Earth about
once every 100 years.

00:30:45.570 --> 00:30:47.950 align:middle line:84%
We've had two of them
now hitting Russia.

00:30:47.950 --> 00:30:50.250 align:middle line:90%
>> In Chelyabinsk, yes.

00:30:50.250 --> 00:30:53.440 align:middle line:84%
>> So two of them hit Russia
within the last 100 years.

00:30:53.440 --> 00:30:55.860 align:middle line:84%
So we expect that, on
average, a city-buster

00:30:55.860 --> 00:30:57.320 align:middle line:90%
hits the planet Earth.

00:30:57.320 --> 00:30:59.490 align:middle line:84%
On average of a
few thousand years,

00:30:59.490 --> 00:31:03.140 align:middle line:84%
we have a nation-buster,
like Apophis.

00:31:03.140 --> 00:31:07.950 align:middle line:84%
Apophis is an asteroid
about 1,000 feet across.

00:31:07.950 --> 00:31:12.880 align:middle line:84%
And it could destroy England
if it were to hit England.

00:31:12.880 --> 00:31:15.520 align:middle line:90%
And that's a nation-buster.

00:31:15.520 --> 00:31:19.360 align:middle line:84%
Every 10 million years,
there's a planet-buster,

00:31:19.360 --> 00:31:23.270 align:middle line:84%
like what hit Mexico
65 million years ago.

00:31:23.270 --> 00:31:26.560 align:middle line:84%
So we have to realize that it's
a crapshoot, it's a gamble.

00:31:26.560 --> 00:31:29.800 align:middle line:84%
We're gambling with
objects in outer space.

00:31:29.800 --> 00:31:31.420 align:middle line:90%
We track the big ones.

00:31:31.420 --> 00:31:33.700 align:middle line:84%
But the little ones,
we don't track.

00:31:33.700 --> 00:31:37.240 align:middle line:84%
And it means that we could
be caught totally unprepared,

00:31:37.240 --> 00:31:39.400 align:middle line:84%
like we were just
this year, when

00:31:39.400 --> 00:31:42.850 align:middle line:84%
an object with a force
of 10 atomic bombs

00:31:42.850 --> 00:31:44.530 align:middle line:90%
came right by the planet Earth.

00:31:44.530 --> 00:31:46.037 align:middle line:90%
>> On July 23?

00:31:46.037 --> 00:31:46.870 align:middle line:90%
>> Around that time.

00:31:46.870 --> 00:31:48.390 align:middle line:84%
Right, in fact, two
of them, not just one.

00:31:48.390 --> 00:31:49.860 align:middle line:84%
>> Yes, and now
there's another one.

00:31:49.860 --> 00:31:50.660 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:31:50.660 --> 00:31:53.890 align:middle line:84%
So we now realize that
we are more in danger

00:31:53.890 --> 00:31:55.360 align:middle line:90%
than we previously thought.

00:31:55.360 --> 00:31:59.020 align:middle line:84%
But on average, once every 100
years, one of the big ones,

00:31:59.020 --> 00:32:02.110 align:middle line:84%
about the size of an apartment
building, hits the Earth.

00:32:02.110 --> 00:32:05.840 align:middle line:84%
>> Will be able to do
something about Apophis?

00:32:05.840 --> 00:32:06.640 align:middle line:90%
it's coming.

00:32:06.640 --> 00:32:08.660 align:middle line:90%
I mean, it's just 10 years away.

00:32:08.660 --> 00:32:10.120 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, the answer is no.

00:32:10.120 --> 00:32:12.370 align:middle line:90%
We are sitting ducks.

00:32:12.370 --> 00:32:15.310 align:middle line:84%
We are defenseless,
totally helpless.

00:32:15.310 --> 00:32:19.510 align:middle line:84%
Let's say, right now,
some amateur astronomer

00:32:19.510 --> 00:32:22.540 align:middle line:84%
sees an object bigger
than an apartment building

00:32:22.540 --> 00:32:23.800 align:middle line:90%
headed to the planet Earth.

00:32:23.800 --> 00:32:24.940 align:middle line:90%
What could we do?

00:32:24.940 --> 00:32:27.100 align:middle line:90%
The answer is nothing.

00:32:27.100 --> 00:32:28.990 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely nothing.

00:32:28.990 --> 00:32:31.060 align:middle line:90%
We have no space shuttle.

00:32:31.060 --> 00:32:35.140 align:middle line:84%
We have no rockets that could
easily reach deep space.

00:32:35.140 --> 00:32:36.820 align:middle line:90%
We don't know the physics.

00:32:36.820 --> 00:32:39.250 align:middle line:84%
Is the rocket going to
blow up the asteroid?

00:32:39.250 --> 00:32:41.230 align:middle line:84%
We have a lot of
small asteroids.

00:32:41.230 --> 00:32:43.790 align:middle line:84%
We don't know about the
physics of these things.

00:32:43.790 --> 00:32:45.040 align:middle line:90%
So we are children.

00:32:45.040 --> 00:32:48.400 align:middle line:84%
We're children when it comes
to threats from outer space.

00:32:48.400 --> 00:32:51.640 align:middle line:84%
>> However, humanity
feels like, when it comes,

00:32:51.640 --> 00:32:53.660 align:middle line:84%
we are going to do
something about it.

00:32:53.660 --> 00:32:54.650 align:middle line:90%
>> That's the movie.

00:32:54.650 --> 00:32:58.030 align:middle line:84%
Everyone expects Bruce Willis
to jump into the space shuttle.

But A, there's no
more space shuttle.

B, there's no replacement
for the space shuttle.

00:33:02.920 --> 00:33:06.760 align:middle line:84%
C, we have no rockets capable
of reaching deep space

00:33:06.760 --> 00:33:08.620 align:middle line:90%
on a moment's notice.

00:33:08.620 --> 00:33:11.110 align:middle line:90%
>> Are you afraid of Apophis?

00:33:11.110 --> 00:33:13.660 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, the latest
projection of Apophis,

00:33:13.660 --> 00:33:16.660 align:middle line:84%
which is an asteroid
about 1,000 feet across,

00:33:16.660 --> 00:33:19.360 align:middle line:84%
shows that it will probably
miss the first time around,

00:33:19.360 --> 00:33:20.660 align:middle line:90%
about 2029.

00:33:20.660 --> 00:33:26.350 align:middle line:84%
However, on the second pass,
that's when all bets are off.

00:33:26.350 --> 00:33:28.030 align:middle line:84%
Because on the first
pass, it's going

00:33:28.030 --> 00:33:30.400 align:middle line:90%
to go through the atmosphere.

00:33:30.400 --> 00:33:32.620 align:middle line:84%
And we cannot
predict accurately,

00:33:32.620 --> 00:33:35.950 align:middle line:84%
using Newton's laws, what
happens when an asteroid goes

00:33:35.950 --> 00:33:38.020 align:middle line:90%
through the air very well.

00:33:38.020 --> 00:33:40.150 align:middle line:84%
So we don't know,
on the second pass,

00:33:40.150 --> 00:33:42.830 align:middle line:84%
if it will hit the Earth
or not-- big question mark.

00:33:42.830 --> 00:33:44.960 align:middle line:90%

00:33:44.960 --> 00:33:46.942 align:middle line:90%

then we will have
numbers to work with.

00:33:53.863 --> 00:33:55.280 align:middle line:84%
But I think that,
in the meantime,

00:33:55.280 --> 00:33:57.400 align:middle line:84%
we should seriously think
about the possibility

00:33:57.400 --> 00:34:01.260 align:middle line:84%
of one day doing something
if an object that big

00:34:01.260 --> 00:34:02.390 align:middle line:90%
were to come by.

00:34:02.390 --> 00:34:04.780 align:middle line:90%
Apophis is a nation-buster.

00:34:04.780 --> 00:34:07.060 align:middle line:84%
It could take out England
if it were to hit the Earth.

00:34:07.060 --> 00:34:14.679 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, after 2029, before
it comes 2036, the same day,

00:34:14.679 --> 00:34:19.030 align:middle line:84%
April 13, we will have
the time to do something.

00:34:19.030 --> 00:34:21.280 align:middle line:84%
Because then is when
we are going to say,

00:34:21.280 --> 00:34:23.889 align:middle line:90%
we have to do something now.

00:34:23.889 --> 00:34:26.929 align:middle line:84%

00:34:26.929 --> 00:34:27.846 align:middle line:90%

00:34:27.846 --> 00:34:28.646 align:middle line:90%
That's right.

00:34:28.646 --> 00:34:30.489 align:middle line:84%
Now, some people say,
why not simply nuke it

00:34:30.489 --> 00:34:31.929 align:middle line:90%
with a nuclear weapon?

00:34:31.929 --> 00:34:33.040 align:middle line:90%
That could make it worse.

00:34:33.040 --> 00:34:35.739 align:middle line:84%

So right now, like I
said, we are defenseless.

00:34:44.000 --> 00:34:44.800 align:middle line:90%
We're clueless.

00:34:44.800 --> 00:34:45.909 align:middle line:90%

You see, most of us spend our
lives looking at the ground.

00:35:27.580 --> 00:35:29.590 align:middle line:84%
Because what's happening
now is that people

00:35:29.590 --> 00:35:31.780 align:middle line:84%
are realizing that we're
reaching critical mass.

00:35:31.780 --> 00:35:35.020 align:middle line:84%

so many videotapes,

hey, maybe, just maybe,
there is something there.

With a fraction of the money
we spend on a battleship,

we could definitely explore

behind these things.

00:36:23.410 --> 00:36:25.930 align:middle line:84%
See, this is a question
of national security.

00:36:25.930 --> 00:36:27.210 align:middle line:90%
Why do we have armies?

00:36:27.210 --> 00:36:28.600 align:middle line:90%
Why do we have navies?

00:36:28.600 --> 00:36:29.940 align:middle line:90%
Why do we have air forces?

00:36:29.940 --> 00:36:31.410 align:middle line:90%
For security.

00:36:31.410 --> 00:36:34.340 align:middle line:84%
But what happens if we bump into
a civilization more advanced

00:36:34.340 --> 00:36:35.140 align:middle line:90%
than us?

00:36:35.140 --> 00:36:36.930 align:middle line:90%
That's a security question.

>> But it's difficult.
They do something to us,

00:36:39.610 --> 00:36:41.378 align:middle line:84%
they will have done
it long ago, I think.

00:36:41.378 --> 00:36:43.170 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, I think that's
an important point.

00:36:43.170 --> 00:36:45.540 align:middle line:90%
They could be dangerous.

00:36:45.540 --> 00:36:46.800 align:middle line:90%
They could be rapacious.

00:36:46.800 --> 00:36:48.480 align:middle line:90%
They may want to conquer us.

00:36:48.480 --> 00:36:49.800 align:middle line:90%
But I think not.

00:36:49.800 --> 00:36:51.180 align:middle line:84%
Because if they're
that advanced,

00:36:51.180 --> 00:36:52.500 align:middle line:90%
they've already been here.

00:36:52.500 --> 00:36:54.150 align:middle line:84%
They already decoded
our language.

00:36:54.150 --> 00:36:56.190 align:middle line:90%
They know our culture.

00:36:56.190 --> 00:36:58.410 align:middle line:84%
And as a consequence,
they haven't

00:36:58.410 --> 00:37:00.270 align:middle line:90%
bothered to take us over.

00:37:00.270 --> 00:37:02.850 align:middle line:84%
So I think, for the most part,
they're going to be peaceful.

00:37:02.850 --> 00:37:06.150 align:middle line:84%
Because what do we have
to offer them, gold?

00:37:06.150 --> 00:37:08.290 align:middle line:84%
I mean, for them,
gold could be useless.

00:37:08.290 --> 00:37:09.720 align:middle line:90%
It's just a yellow mineral.

00:37:09.720 --> 00:37:11.250 align:middle line:90%
That's all it is for them.

00:37:11.250 --> 00:37:12.190 align:middle line:90%
What do they want?

00:37:12.190 --> 00:37:12.990 align:middle line:90%
water?

00:37:12.990 --> 00:37:15.270 align:middle line:84%
There's plenty of
water in outer space.

00:37:15.270 --> 00:37:16.210 align:middle line:90%
What do they want?

00:37:16.210 --> 00:37:18.030 align:middle line:84%
There's nothing that
we have that they

00:37:18.030 --> 00:37:21.073 align:middle line:90%
can't get by going to Mars.

00:37:21.073 --> 00:37:22.740 align:middle line:84%
And the uninhabited
planet where there's

00:37:22.740 --> 00:37:25.290 align:middle line:84%
nobody to worry about,
plenty of resources

00:37:25.290 --> 00:37:26.950 align:middle line:90%
to plunder if they want.

00:37:26.950 --> 00:37:29.340 align:middle line:84%
And so we have
nothing to offer them

00:37:29.340 --> 00:37:30.900 align:middle line:90%
for them to want to conquer us.

00:37:30.900 --> 00:37:33.480 align:middle line:90%


00:37:33.480 --> 00:37:36.570 align:middle line:84%
>> If they are here,
why would they be here?

00:37:36.570 --> 00:37:39.960 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, we physicists have
looked into the question of how

00:37:39.960 --> 00:37:42.120 align:middle line:90%
to best explore the galaxy.

00:37:42.120 --> 00:37:44.790 align:middle line:84%
In the movie,
"2001," you remember

00:37:44.790 --> 00:37:48.160 align:middle line:84%
that there was, on the
moon, an object, an object

00:37:48.160 --> 00:37:52.230 align:middle line:84%
that scanned the solar system,
looking for intelligent life.

00:37:52.230 --> 00:37:54.930 align:middle line:84%
And it reproduced itself,
made copies of itself,

00:37:54.930 --> 00:37:57.540 align:middle line:84%
and shot into other
distant moons.

00:37:57.540 --> 00:37:58.910 align:middle line:90%
That is like a virus.

00:37:58.910 --> 00:38:02.190 align:middle line:84%
A virus is just
one molecule that

00:38:02.190 --> 00:38:05.110 align:middle line:84%
colonizes your entire
body in two weeks,

00:38:05.110 --> 00:38:07.320 align:middle line:84%
and you start to
sneeze and cough.

00:38:07.320 --> 00:38:08.640 align:middle line:90%
That's amazing.

00:38:08.640 --> 00:38:10.770 align:middle line:90%
So we shoot these viruses.

00:38:10.770 --> 00:38:12.870 align:middle line:84%
And these intelligent
civilizations

00:38:12.870 --> 00:38:15.720 align:middle line:84%
can shoot these viruses,
called von Neumann probes,

00:38:15.720 --> 00:38:18.990 align:middle line:84%
to reproduce on
moons, and to scatter

00:38:18.990 --> 00:38:20.250 align:middle line:90%
throughout the universe.

00:38:20.250 --> 00:38:23.310 align:middle line:84%
So in other words,
on our moon, there

00:38:23.310 --> 00:38:26.610 align:middle line:84%
could be an object left
over from a passing

00:38:26.610 --> 00:38:28.350 align:middle line:90%
type 3 civilization.

00:38:28.350 --> 00:38:30.570 align:middle line:84%
Because that's the
most efficient way

00:38:30.570 --> 00:38:32.700 align:middle line:90%
to explore the galaxy.

00:38:32.700 --> 00:38:35.640 align:middle line:84%
>> In your book, you mention
the possibility that probably

00:38:35.640 --> 00:38:37.980 align:middle line:90%
the visitors are not organic.

00:38:37.980 --> 00:38:39.790 align:middle line:84%
Probably they are
something else.

00:38:39.790 --> 00:38:40.590 align:middle line:90%
>> That's right.

00:38:40.590 --> 00:38:44.640 align:middle line:84%
We, as humans, may eventually
become part cybernetic

00:38:44.640 --> 00:38:45.930 align:middle line:90%
in the future.

00:38:45.930 --> 00:38:48.960 align:middle line:84%
We may actually merge with
some of our creations.

00:38:48.960 --> 00:38:50.610 align:middle line:84%
Now, realize that
some people think

00:38:50.610 --> 00:38:52.140 align:middle line:84%
that robots will
eventually become

00:38:52.140 --> 00:38:54.330 align:middle line:90%
so smart they'll take over.

00:38:54.330 --> 00:38:55.980 align:middle line:84%
Because they can
be made smarter,

00:38:55.980 --> 00:38:57.270 align:middle line:90%
and smarter, and smarter.

00:38:57.270 --> 00:38:58.810 align:middle line:90%
And we are humans.

00:38:58.810 --> 00:39:00.690 align:middle line:90%
We can't do that, OK.

00:39:00.690 --> 00:39:02.910 align:middle line:84%
At a certain point,
they may take over.

00:39:02.910 --> 00:39:06.060 align:middle line:84%
However, there's another,
third, possibility.

00:39:06.060 --> 00:39:09.210 align:middle line:84%
And the third possibility is
maybe we'll merge with them.

00:39:09.210 --> 00:39:11.440 align:middle line:84%
This is not going to
happen anytime soon,

00:39:11.440 --> 00:39:14.400 align:middle line:84%
maybe on a scale of
centuries into the future.

00:39:14.400 --> 00:39:15.930 align:middle line:90%
But that is an option.

00:39:15.930 --> 00:39:17.610 align:middle line:84%
Because once you're
part cybernetic,

00:39:17.610 --> 00:39:19.080 align:middle line:90%
you can become Superman.

00:39:19.080 --> 00:39:20.370 align:middle line:90%
You can live forever.

00:39:20.370 --> 00:39:23.130 align:middle line:84%
You can live on any
planet you want--

00:39:23.130 --> 00:39:26.400 align:middle line:84%
any gravity, any
atmospheric content.

00:39:26.400 --> 00:39:28.110 align:middle line:84%
You can live anywhere
in the universe

00:39:28.110 --> 00:39:29.310 align:middle line:90%
if you're part cybernetic.

00:39:29.310 --> 00:39:31.620 align:middle line:84%
And that could be the
future of the human race.

00:39:31.620 --> 00:39:34.890 align:middle line:84%
So when we meet an
intelligent civilization,

00:39:34.890 --> 00:39:40.260 align:middle line:84%
we should not be surprised
if they're part cybernetic.

00:39:40.260 --> 00:39:43.440 align:middle line:84%
>> Are you excited to
be living at this time?

00:39:43.440 --> 00:39:46.860 align:middle line:84%
>> I think, of all the eras
to be born in, this is perhaps

00:39:46.860 --> 00:39:48.270 align:middle line:90%
the most exciting.

00:39:48.270 --> 00:39:53.280 align:middle line:84%
Because we're at the cusp of
this rapid increase in science

00:39:53.280 --> 00:39:54.750 align:middle line:90%
and technology.

00:39:54.750 --> 00:39:58.440 align:middle line:84%
When I was a child, I used to
read about the solar system.

00:39:58.440 --> 00:40:00.930 align:middle line:84%
And we used to talk
about Mars and Martians,

00:40:00.930 --> 00:40:02.770 align:middle line:90%
talk about Saturn and Jupiter.

00:40:02.770 --> 00:40:04.470 align:middle line:90%
But we had never visited them.

00:40:04.470 --> 00:40:06.910 align:middle line:90%
They were a complete mystery.

00:40:06.910 --> 00:40:09.420 align:middle line:84%
Now we've been to
all the planets.

00:40:09.420 --> 00:40:12.250 align:middle line:84%
We have gorgeous photographs
of all these things.

00:40:12.250 --> 00:40:16.260 align:middle line:84%
But when I was a child, we knew
nothing, absolutely nothing,

00:40:16.260 --> 00:40:19.390 align:middle line:84%
about these planets
and what's out there.

00:40:19.390 --> 00:40:21.180 align:middle line:84%
So this, I think, is
one of the best times

00:40:21.180 --> 00:40:24.570 align:middle line:84%
to be alive, because we're
at the cusp of understanding

00:40:24.570 --> 00:40:25.980 align:middle line:90%
the universe.

00:40:25.980 --> 00:40:27.780 align:middle line:90%
>> You're an amazing person.

00:40:27.780 --> 00:40:30.450 align:middle line:84%
Why did you become
an astrophysicist?

00:40:30.450 --> 00:40:32.790 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, when I was
eight years old,

00:40:32.790 --> 00:40:35.190 align:middle line:84%
something happened
which changed my life.

00:40:35.190 --> 00:40:37.180 align:middle line:90%
The newspapers had a story.

00:40:37.180 --> 00:40:39.260 align:middle line:90%
A great scientist had died.

00:40:39.260 --> 00:40:42.060 align:middle line:84%
And they put a picture of
his desk on the front page.

00:40:42.060 --> 00:40:46.050 align:middle line:84%
The caption said, this is
the unfinished manuscript

00:40:46.050 --> 00:40:48.490 align:middle line:84%
of the greatest
scientist of our time.

00:40:48.490 --> 00:40:50.010 align:middle line:90%
So I was 8 years old.

00:40:50.010 --> 00:40:52.560 align:middle line:84%
I said, well, why couldn't
he finish this book?

00:40:52.560 --> 00:40:53.820 align:middle line:90%
What's so hard?

00:40:53.820 --> 00:40:55.450 align:middle line:90%
It's a homework problem, right?

00:40:55.450 --> 00:40:57.240 align:middle line:90%
Why didn't he ask his mother?

00:40:57.240 --> 00:40:59.520 align:middle line:84%
Well, I went to the
library, and I found out

00:40:59.520 --> 00:41:02.580 align:middle line:90%
this man was Albert Einstein.

00:41:02.580 --> 00:41:05.910 align:middle line:84%
And the book was "The
Theory of Everything."

00:41:05.910 --> 00:41:10.140 align:middle line:84%
He wanted the God equation,
one equation, 1 inch long,

00:41:10.140 --> 00:41:13.470 align:middle line:84%
that would allow us to
read the mind of God,

00:41:13.470 --> 00:41:17.590 align:middle line:84%
to unify all physical
laws into one equation.

00:41:17.590 --> 00:41:20.310 align:middle line:84%
So for me, this was greater
than any murder mystery.

00:41:20.310 --> 00:41:22.530 align:middle line:84%
This is greater than
any adventure story.

00:41:22.530 --> 00:41:25.830 align:middle line:84%
I had to know what
was in that book.

00:41:25.830 --> 00:41:28.500 align:middle line:90%
Why couldn't he finish it?

00:41:28.500 --> 00:41:31.390 align:middle line:84%
Well, today, that's
what I do for a living.

00:41:31.390 --> 00:41:33.810 align:middle line:84%
We think we have the theory,
the theory of everything,

00:41:33.810 --> 00:41:34.950 align:middle line:90%
string theory.

00:41:34.950 --> 00:41:38.760 align:middle line:84%
It's not in its final form,
but we're testing aspects of it

00:41:38.760 --> 00:41:41.550 align:middle line:90%
with the Large Hadron Collider.

00:41:41.550 --> 00:41:45.030 align:middle line:84%
The God particle was discovered
just a few years ago.

00:41:45.030 --> 00:41:46.920 align:middle line:84%
And we think that
this could be it.

00:41:46.920 --> 00:41:50.325 align:middle line:84%
We're hot on the trail of
the theory of everything.

00:41:50.325 --> 00:41:51.450 align:middle line:90%
>> Tell us more about that.

00:41:51.450 --> 00:41:52.885 align:middle line:90%
This is fascinating.

00:41:52.885 --> 00:41:55.260 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, we believe that,
well, why do we have electrons,

00:41:55.260 --> 00:41:56.580 align:middle line:90%
neutrons, protons?

00:41:56.580 --> 00:41:58.830 align:middle line:84%
Why do you have
so many particles?

00:41:58.830 --> 00:42:00.690 align:middle line:84%
Because they're
just rubber bands,

00:42:00.690 --> 00:42:03.330 align:middle line:84%
tiny rubber bands that
vibrate in a certain way.

00:42:03.330 --> 00:42:05.820 align:middle line:84%
This is an electron,
and this is a quark,

00:42:05.820 --> 00:42:07.980 align:middle line:90%
this is a gauge particle.

00:42:07.980 --> 00:42:09.420 align:middle line:90%
That's what we have so many.

00:42:09.420 --> 00:42:11.280 align:middle line:84%
So all the subatomic
particles are nothing

00:42:11.280 --> 00:42:13.380 align:middle line:90%
but musical notes on a string.

00:42:13.380 --> 00:42:14.760 align:middle line:90%
What is physics?

00:42:14.760 --> 00:42:17.310 align:middle line:84%
Physics is the
harmonies you can write

00:42:17.310 --> 00:42:19.260 align:middle line:90%
on these vibrating strings.

00:42:19.260 --> 00:42:20.740 align:middle line:90%
What is chemistry?

00:42:20.740 --> 00:42:23.130 align:middle line:84%
Chemistry is the melodies
that you can play

00:42:23.130 --> 00:42:25.350 align:middle line:90%
and all these vibrating strings?

00:42:25.350 --> 00:42:26.790 align:middle line:90%
What is the universe?

00:42:26.790 --> 00:42:30.310 align:middle line:84%
The universe is a
symphony of strings.

00:42:30.310 --> 00:42:35.340 align:middle line:10%
And then what is the mind of
God that Einstein spent 30 years

00:42:35.340 --> 00:42:37.440 align:middle line:10%
of his life chasing after?

00:42:37.440 --> 00:42:44.610 align:middle line:84%
The mind of God is cosmic music
resonating through hyperspace.

00:42:44.610 --> 00:42:46.784 align:middle line:90%
That is the mind of God.

00:42:46.784 --> 00:42:48.635 align:middle line:90%
>> And are you going to find it?

00:42:48.635 --> 00:42:50.010 align:middle line:84%
Are you going to
finish the book?

00:42:50.010 --> 00:42:51.218 align:middle line:90%
>> Well, that's what we hope.

00:42:51.218 --> 00:42:53.410 align:middle line:84%
We hope to finish it, dot
the i's and cross the t's.

00:42:53.410 --> 00:42:54.210 align:middle line:90%
We hope to finish.

00:42:54.210 --> 00:42:55.260 align:middle line:90%
We have the theory.

00:42:55.260 --> 00:42:58.470 align:middle line:84%
The theory is not quite
in its final form yet.

00:42:58.470 --> 00:43:04.560 align:middle line:84%
>> I heard that just
nanoseconds after the big bang,

00:43:04.560 --> 00:43:08.070 align:middle line:84%
it's when really God
manifested himself,

00:43:08.070 --> 00:43:13.960 align:middle line:84%
because everything is a
consequence of what is before.

00:43:13.960 --> 00:43:17.460 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, when I was a child, I
realized that my parents were

00:43:17.460 --> 00:43:18.510 align:middle line:90%
Buddhists.

00:43:18.510 --> 00:43:22.400 align:middle line:84%
But I was raised as a
Christian as a youth.

00:43:22.400 --> 00:43:24.090 align:middle line:84%
And they have two
different opinions

00:43:24.090 --> 00:43:25.860 align:middle line:84%
about the origin
of the universe.

00:43:25.860 --> 00:43:27.900 align:middle line:84%
Christianity says
there was a moment when

00:43:27.900 --> 00:43:30.360 align:middle line:90%
God said, let there be light.

00:43:30.360 --> 00:43:32.310 align:middle line:90%
In Buddhism is nirvana--

00:43:32.310 --> 00:43:36.030 align:middle line:84%
no beginning, no end,
just timeless nirvana.

00:43:36.030 --> 00:43:38.950 align:middle line:84%
Now we have a new theory,
called the multiverse,

00:43:38.950 --> 00:43:42.990 align:middle line:84%
which allows us to unify
two different pictures.

00:43:42.990 --> 00:43:45.060 align:middle line:90%
Our universe had a beginning.

00:43:45.060 --> 00:43:46.620 align:middle line:90%
Our universe is a bubble.

00:43:46.620 --> 00:43:47.790 align:middle line:90%
The bubble's expanding.

00:43:47.790 --> 00:43:49.350 align:middle line:84%
That's called the
Big Bang Theory.

00:43:49.350 --> 00:43:53.460 align:middle line:84%
But there are other bubbles
out there, other universes.

00:43:53.460 --> 00:43:55.080 align:middle line:90%
They pop into existence.

00:43:55.080 --> 00:43:56.970 align:middle line:90%
Maybe they disappear.

00:43:56.970 --> 00:43:58.650 align:middle line:90%
We have a bubble bath--

00:43:58.650 --> 00:44:01.410 align:middle line:90%
a bubble bath of baby universes.

00:44:01.410 --> 00:44:04.500 align:middle line:84%
Well, our universe is
one of these bubbles.

00:44:04.500 --> 00:44:08.400 align:middle line:84%
And so, yes, our universe had a
beginning, like the Bible says.

00:44:08.400 --> 00:44:10.440 align:middle line:90%
Our universe had a beginning.

00:44:10.440 --> 00:44:13.290 align:middle line:84%
But in nirvana,
its timelessness.

00:44:13.290 --> 00:44:15.730 align:middle line:90%
And that is the bubble bath.

00:44:15.730 --> 00:44:18.300 align:middle line:84%
So nirvana is the
hyperspace in which

00:44:18.300 --> 00:44:20.550 align:middle line:90%
bubbles form all the time.

00:44:20.550 --> 00:44:22.920 align:middle line:84%
And that is called
the multiverse theory,

00:44:22.920 --> 00:44:26.610 align:middle line:84%
which is now the dominant
theory in theoretical physics.

00:44:26.610 --> 00:44:29.190 align:middle line:84%
It means that big bangs
happen all the time.

00:44:29.190 --> 00:44:31.440 align:middle line:84%
It means that we can go
before the beginning.

00:44:31.440 --> 00:44:35.460 align:middle line:84%
We can go before the
instant of creation itself.

00:44:35.460 --> 00:44:37.290 align:middle line:84%
Now, Stephen Hawking,
my colleague,

00:44:37.290 --> 00:44:41.420 align:middle line:84%
said that he did not believe in
God because if the universe was

00:44:41.420 --> 00:44:45.880 align:middle line:84%
created instantly, there was
no time for God to create

00:44:45.880 --> 00:44:48.020 align:middle line:84%
the universe, because the
universe happened just

00:44:48.020 --> 00:44:49.100 align:middle line:90%
like that.

00:44:49.100 --> 00:44:51.230 align:middle line:84%
But you see, if
there's a multiverse,

00:44:51.230 --> 00:44:53.570 align:middle line:84%
and universes are
constantly being created,

00:44:53.570 --> 00:44:56.750 align:middle line:84%
there's plenty of time
to create a universe.

00:44:56.750 --> 00:44:59.900 align:middle line:84%
So I think Stephen was
wrong on this question.

00:44:59.900 --> 00:45:05.240 align:middle line:84%
>> Before we finish, I just
want your opinion on Avi Loeb,

00:45:05.240 --> 00:45:08.685 align:middle line:90%
what he found with 'Oumuamua.

00:45:08.685 --> 00:45:11.840 align:middle line:84%
Do you think this was
really a meteorite,

00:45:11.840 --> 00:45:14.180 align:middle line:90%
or was intelligent craft?

00:45:14.180 --> 00:45:18.500 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, we saw this object
coming in from outer space.

00:45:18.500 --> 00:45:20.990 align:middle line:84%
And using Newton's laws of
motion, we went backwards.

00:45:20.990 --> 00:45:22.820 align:middle line:90%
We tracked where it came from.

00:45:22.820 --> 00:45:27.530 align:middle line:84%
And we said, my God, it came
from outside the solar system.

00:45:27.530 --> 00:45:29.360 align:middle line:90%
We've never seen this before--

00:45:29.360 --> 00:45:33.770 align:middle line:84%
an object not within
Saturn and Jupiter's orbit,

00:45:33.770 --> 00:45:36.950 align:middle line:84%
but outside the
solar system itself.

00:45:36.950 --> 00:45:39.350 align:middle line:90%
And the orbit was eccentric.

00:45:39.350 --> 00:45:42.570 align:middle line:84%
It did not quite obey
Newton' laws of motion.

00:45:42.570 --> 00:45:45.290 align:middle line:84%
So maybe it was a rocket
ship, some people said.

00:45:45.290 --> 00:45:47.210 align:middle line:90%
Or maybe it was space dust.

00:45:47.210 --> 00:45:50.030 align:middle line:84%
That's why the orbit is
not quite exactly according

00:45:50.030 --> 00:45:51.770 align:middle line:90%
to Einstein prediction.

00:45:51.770 --> 00:45:53.750 align:middle line:90%
Well, it came and it left.

00:45:53.750 --> 00:45:55.590 align:middle line:90%
So we don't know.

00:45:55.590 --> 00:45:58.100 align:middle line:84%
All we do know is that the
universe is more mysterious

00:45:58.100 --> 00:45:59.090 align:middle line:90%
than we thought.

00:45:59.090 --> 00:46:03.260 align:middle line:84%
And visitors from
above the solar system

00:46:03.260 --> 00:46:05.990 align:middle line:84%
are more common than
we previously thought.

00:46:05.990 --> 00:46:08.620 align:middle line:84%
Outside our solar system--
who would have thought?

00:46:08.620 --> 00:46:11.510 align:middle line:84%
And it means that we are part
of a much larger universe.

00:46:11.510 --> 00:46:13.910 align:middle line:84%
We spend all our time thinking
about our solar system

00:46:13.910 --> 00:46:14.960 align:middle line:90%
and the Earth.

00:46:14.960 --> 00:46:17.780 align:middle line:84%
But there are other solar
system that can touch us.

00:46:17.780 --> 00:46:22.040 align:middle line:84%
Things from other solar systems
go right through our backyard

00:46:22.040 --> 00:46:23.300 align:middle line:90%
all the time.

00:46:23.300 --> 00:46:26.180 align:middle line:84%
And we were clueless
until recently.

00:46:26.180 --> 00:46:29.040 align:middle line:90%
>> Like the TRAPPIST system?

00:46:29.040 --> 00:46:29.840 align:middle line:90%
>> That's right.

00:46:29.840 --> 00:46:31.820 align:middle line:84%
All of a sudden, we
see systems with not

00:46:31.820 --> 00:46:35.960 align:middle line:84%
just one Earth-like
planet, but many planets

00:46:35.960 --> 00:46:37.190 align:middle line:90%
that are Earth-like.

00:46:37.190 --> 00:46:38.840 align:middle line:90%
Remember the movie, "Star Wars"?

00:46:38.840 --> 00:46:41.630 align:middle line:84%
There was a scene where Luke
Skywalker looked up in the sky,

00:46:41.630 --> 00:46:44.330 align:middle line:90%
and there were two suns.

00:46:44.330 --> 00:46:45.680 align:middle line:90%
Astronomers laughed.

00:46:45.680 --> 00:46:47.750 align:middle line:90%
They said, ha, stupid.

00:46:47.750 --> 00:46:50.510 align:middle line:84%
People don't realize
you can't have two suns.

00:46:50.510 --> 00:46:53.570 align:middle line:84%
The planet going around
would be unstable.

00:46:53.570 --> 00:46:55.550 align:middle line:90%
All the astronomers laughed.

00:46:55.550 --> 00:47:00.120 align:middle line:84%
Now we find triple star
systems, three-star systems.

00:47:00.120 --> 00:47:04.100 align:middle line:10%
In fact, the nearest star to the
earth is the Centauri system.

00:47:04.100 --> 00:47:08.420 align:middle line:10%
Proxima Centauri is the third
star of a triple-star system.

00:47:08.420 --> 00:47:10.160 align:middle line:84%
And it has a planet
going around it,

00:47:10.160 --> 00:47:15.140 align:middle line:84%
called Proxima B, which is the
closest planet to the planet

00:47:15.140 --> 00:47:17.480 align:middle line:90%
Earth that is Earth-like.

00:47:17.480 --> 00:47:21.180 align:middle line:84%
And so the creators of Star
Wars have the last laugh.

00:47:21.180 --> 00:47:24.840 align:middle line:84%
They were right,
astronomers were wrong.

00:47:24.840 --> 00:47:27.550 align:middle line:84%

very much for this interview.

00:47:27.550 --> 00:47:31.230 align:middle line:84%
On the name of all the
Spanish-speaking viewers,

00:47:31.230 --> 00:47:32.030 align:middle line:90%
thank you.

so much knowledge,

00:47:36.560 --> 00:47:38.720 align:middle line:84%

wise man, probably

00:47:38.720 --> 00:47:41.120 align:middle line:90%
the cleverest in the planet.

00:47:41.120 --> 00:47:41.960 align:middle line:90%
Thank you very much.

00:47:41.960 --> 00:47:44.450 align:middle line:90%
>> Thank you very much.

00:47:44.450 --> 00:47:45.744 align:middle line:90%

00:47:48.910 --> 00:47:52.930 align:middle line:84%
The burden of proof is now on
the side of the government.

00:47:52.930 --> 00:47:57.670 align:middle line:84%
Finally a great
scientist is recognizing

00:47:57.670 --> 00:48:00.520 align:middle line:90%
that this phenomenon is real.

00:48:00.520 --> 00:48:06.620 align:middle line:84%
Now the authorities hope to
demonstrate that this is not,

00:48:06.620 --> 00:48:09.410 align:middle line:84%
and that is going to be
very difficult, especially

00:48:09.410 --> 00:48:13.550 align:middle line:84%
with the kind of
proof we have now,

00:48:13.550 --> 00:48:17.940 align:middle line:84%
that it comes directly
from the authorities.

00:48:17.940 --> 00:48:20.670 align:middle line:84%
This is a new time,
a new beginning.

00:48:20.670 --> 00:48:25.670 align:middle line:84%
And I think Dr. Kaku set the
stage for the near future.

00:48:25.670 --> 00:48:28.970 align:middle line:84%
I hope you have
enjoyed this interview.
