as we shall see, it was crucial.

On March 25, 2011, at
5:00 in the afternoon

00:01:47.080 --> 00:01:49.870 align:middle line:84%
from a park near
his home, Antonio

00:01:49.870 --> 00:01:52.210 align:middle line:84%
would take 22
photographs of a ship

00:01:52.210 --> 00:01:56.210 align:middle line:84%
with his camera using a
1,000 millimeter lens.

00:01:56.210 --> 00:01:58.000 align:middle line:84%
The images are
clear, and you can

00:01:58.000 --> 00:01:59.770 align:middle line:84%
follow the sequence
that allows you

00:01:59.770 --> 00:02:03.200 align:middle line:84%
to establish the possible
movements of the object.

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:06.400 align:middle line:84%
This would be the first time
he would only take photographs,

00:02:06.400 --> 00:02:07.330 align:middle line:90%
and not videos.

00:02:07.330 --> 00:02:10.570 align:middle line:90%


00:02:10.570 --> 00:02:12.940 align:middle line:84%
In the images you can
see the reflection

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:15.190 align:middle line:90%
of the sun on the UFO.

00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:19.240 align:middle line:84%
This happened on March 25,
at 5:40 in the afternoon,

00:02:19.240 --> 00:02:21.250 align:middle line:90%
in northern Italy.

00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:25.930 align:middle line:84%
Later, on September
19, 2011, Antonio

00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:29.350 align:middle line:84%
captured a new
photographic sequence.

00:02:29.350 --> 00:02:31.840 align:middle line:84%
The photographs
were taken at 6:55

00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:35.890 align:middle line:84%
in the early evening, with a
professional type DSLR camera

00:02:35.890 --> 00:02:40.340 align:middle line:84%
model 60D, with a
Samyang telephoto lens.

00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:44.470 align:middle line:84%
The digital photography
specialist, Guillermo Anaya,

00:02:44.470 --> 00:02:47.890 align:middle line:84%
was commissioned to perform
one of the two analyses

00:02:47.890 --> 00:02:50.680 align:middle line:84%
that were made on this
material, and reached

00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:53.200 align:middle line:90%
several conclusions.

00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:55.780 align:middle line:10%
The photographs
show two objects,

00:02:55.780 --> 00:02:59.820 align:middle line:10%
one about 10 feet in diameter
with a circular shape

00:02:59.820 --> 00:03:02.250 align:middle line:10%
and a sphere that
apparently revolved

00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:05.430 align:middle line:10%
around the more massive object.

00:03:05.430 --> 00:03:08.730 align:middle line:84%
The analyst verified the
time of sunset in Milan

00:03:08.730 --> 00:03:12.330 align:middle line:84%
on that day, which
was at 7:28 PM.

00:03:12.330 --> 00:03:14.970 align:middle line:84%
This means that for the
period of the sequence,

00:03:14.970 --> 00:03:18.800 align:middle line:84%
there was still 30
minutes of sunlight.

00:03:18.800 --> 00:03:23.300 align:middle line:84%
The photograph studied were
the original 17.9 megapixels,

00:03:23.300 --> 00:03:26.360 align:middle line:84%
which is the base
resolution of the camera.

00:03:26.360 --> 00:03:28.730 align:middle line:84%
It also showed
its original mark,

00:03:28.730 --> 00:03:33.180 align:middle line:84%
which allowed a study of camera
movement by the photographer.

00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:37.770 align:middle line:84%
The format of the files, like
jpg, which is used the most,

00:03:37.770 --> 00:03:40.320 align:middle line:84%
permits us to keep a
history of the changes

00:03:40.320 --> 00:03:42.570 align:middle line:90%
by the EXIF standard.

00:03:42.570 --> 00:03:46.560 align:middle line:84%
When this file is created by
a photographic or video medium

00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:48.900 align:middle line:84%
or by the different
editing programs,

00:03:48.900 --> 00:03:53.130 align:middle line:90%
it is the soul of an image.

00:03:53.130 --> 00:03:58.440 align:middle line:84%
Then he made the analysis with
the ELA, Error Level Analysis.

00:03:58.440 --> 00:04:00.990 align:middle line:84%
And it turned out that
the edge that appears

00:04:00.990 --> 00:04:03.450 align:middle line:84%
is due to the
degradation of the file,

00:04:03.450 --> 00:04:05.670 align:middle line:84%
and not because of
the superimposition

00:04:05.670 --> 00:04:08.730 align:middle line:90%
of a foreign object.

00:04:08.730 --> 00:04:14.280 align:middle line:84%
Here we see that the side is
softer, almost imperceptible,

00:04:14.280 --> 00:04:17.610 align:middle line:84%
which indicates that the
objects are fully integrated

00:04:17.610 --> 00:04:18.690 align:middle line:90%
into the background.

00:04:18.690 --> 00:04:22.600 align:middle line:90%


00:04:22.600 --> 00:04:25.840 align:middle line:84%
When carrying out the
study by other methods,

00:04:25.840 --> 00:04:29.410 align:middle line:84%
it was found that there are
no superimposed pixels that

00:04:29.410 --> 00:04:33.190 align:middle line:84%
can be detected in a gradual
and constant increase

00:04:33.190 --> 00:04:35.860 align:middle line:90%
of the edge towards the bottom.

00:04:35.860 --> 00:04:41.950 align:middle line:10%
However, the material of the
spheres in the image IMG0081

00:04:41.950 --> 00:04:45.100 align:middle line:10%
is different.

00:04:45.100 --> 00:04:49.290 align:middle line:84%
But here we have a case that
has been thoroughly studied.

00:04:49.290 --> 00:04:51.700 align:middle line:84%
The threads of
evidence are digital,

00:04:51.700 --> 00:04:53.760 align:middle line:90%
which could be falsified.

00:04:53.760 --> 00:04:56.820 align:middle line:84%
Nevertheless, at the same
time, the modern tools

00:04:56.820 --> 00:05:01.200 align:middle line:84%
allow us to detect any
type of alteration.

00:05:01.200 --> 00:05:03.300 align:middle line:84%
You can determine
the size or if it

00:05:03.300 --> 00:05:06.240 align:middle line:90%
is animated with relative ease.

00:05:06.240 --> 00:05:10.370 align:middle line:84%
That is why here they will
show, in great detail,

00:05:10.370 --> 00:05:13.500 align:middle line:84%
the step-by-step analysis
by one of the best

00:05:13.500 --> 00:05:15.330 align:middle line:90%
specialists in the world.

00:05:15.330 --> 00:05:18.240 align:middle line:90%


00:05:18.240 --> 00:05:23.040 align:middle line:84%
Giuseppe Garófalo has analyzed
each one of Antonio's videos

00:05:23.040 --> 00:05:28.210 align:middle line:84%
and images over 15 years
without finding a single fake.

00:05:28.210 --> 00:05:31.720 align:middle line:84%
Garófalo is a video analyst
with more than 20 years

00:05:31.720 --> 00:05:35.530 align:middle line:84%
of experience, and has knowledge
of practically all the programs

00:05:35.530 --> 00:05:38.540 align:middle line:84%
available to perform
digital image analysis.

00:05:38.540 --> 00:05:41.570 align:middle line:90%


00:05:41.570 --> 00:05:44.810 align:middle line:84%
First, it is necessary
to establish whether it

00:05:44.810 --> 00:05:47.660 align:middle line:90%
is a large or small object.

00:05:47.660 --> 00:05:52.090 align:middle line:84%
Small objects closer to a lens
generate very thick edges,

00:05:52.090 --> 00:05:56.210 align:middle line:84%
while at a greater distance
they create subtle borders.

00:05:56.210 --> 00:05:59.150 align:middle line:84%
This can be determined
using Gaussian filters.

00:05:59.150 --> 00:06:02.240 align:middle line:90%


00:06:02.240 --> 00:06:11.690 align:middle line:10%
>> [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

00:06:11.690 --> 00:06:12.490 align:middle line:10%
>> Yes.

00:06:12.490 --> 00:06:15.770 align:middle line:10%
>> [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

00:06:15.770 --> 00:06:18.890 align:middle line:84%
>> The results are conclusive
because all the material

00:06:18.890 --> 00:06:21.595 align:middle line:84%
of Antonio Urzi
is original, real.

00:06:21.595 --> 00:06:25.320 align:middle line:90%


00:06:25.320 --> 00:06:29.230 align:middle line:10%
Before reaching this decision,
I had to make a precise analysis

00:06:29.230 --> 00:06:32.235 align:middle line:10%
specifically concerning
the edges and contours.

00:06:32.235 --> 00:06:36.410 align:middle line:90%


00:06:36.410 --> 00:06:40.160 align:middle line:84%
I used a software filter,
such as the Gaussian Filter

00:06:40.160 --> 00:06:44.060 align:middle line:84%
Operator, which is the best
way to determine the margins

00:06:44.060 --> 00:06:47.220 align:middle line:90%
and outline of an object.

00:06:47.220 --> 00:06:49.160 align:middle line:84%
When an object has
large dimensions

00:06:49.160 --> 00:06:52.580 align:middle line:84%
and a particular volume
while at high altitude,

00:06:52.580 --> 00:06:59.300 align:middle line:84%
its edges are very thin,
contrary to when an object is

00:06:59.300 --> 00:07:02.480 align:middle line:90%
smaller and a closer distance.

00:07:02.480 --> 00:07:04.280 align:middle line:84%
The edges are
thicker and denser.

00:07:04.280 --> 00:07:10.660 align:middle line:90%


00:07:10.660 --> 00:07:13.040 align:middle line:84%
Now I'm going to show
you Antonio's material.

00:07:13.040 --> 00:07:16.430 align:middle line:90%


00:07:16.430 --> 00:07:19.870 align:middle line:84%
As we can see, the
edge is very thin.

00:07:19.870 --> 00:07:26.080 align:middle line:90%


00:07:26.080 --> 00:07:30.455 align:middle line:84%
Here we can compare the
discoidal object of Antonio.

00:07:30.455 --> 00:07:33.020 align:middle line:90%


00:07:33.020 --> 00:07:34.870 align:middle line:90%
We can see the whole image.

00:07:34.870 --> 00:07:39.050 align:middle line:84%
And it is possible to notice
the edges are very thick, which

00:07:39.050 --> 00:07:41.800 align:middle line:84%
means that the object is very
close to the trees, which

00:07:41.800 --> 00:07:42.600 align:middle line:90%
appear smaller.

00:07:42.600 --> 00:07:46.300 align:middle line:90%


00:07:46.300 --> 00:07:48.530 align:middle line:84%
The disk that
appears to be bigger,

00:07:48.530 --> 00:07:52.220 align:middle line:84%
and has more volume
as it moves away.

00:07:52.220 --> 00:07:55.240 align:middle line:84%
Here are other examples
of flying objects.

00:07:55.240 --> 00:07:58.280 align:middle line:84%
And with this, we go
from unknown objects

00:07:58.280 --> 00:08:01.770 align:middle line:90%
to ordinary terrestrial objects.

00:08:01.770 --> 00:08:05.465 align:middle line:84%
As you can see in this picture,
I applied the Gaussian filter.

00:08:05.465 --> 00:08:08.070 align:middle line:90%


00:08:08.070 --> 00:08:11.500 align:middle line:84%
And we noticed that the edge
or the outline of the airplane

00:08:11.500 --> 00:08:12.300 align:middle line:90%
is thin.

00:08:12.300 --> 00:08:16.020 align:middle line:90%


00:08:16.020 --> 00:08:18.110 align:middle line:84%
Then I looked for
an image where it

00:08:18.110 --> 00:08:20.720 align:middle line:84%
was possible to see
the roof of a building.

00:08:20.720 --> 00:08:23.360 align:middle line:84%
And upon closer
examination, the edge

00:08:23.360 --> 00:08:26.770 align:middle line:84%
is much thicker than that, of
the airplane, which is thinner.

00:08:26.770 --> 00:08:32.950 align:middle line:90%
On

00:08:32.950 --> 00:08:40.609 align:middle line:84%
This school is a UFO filmed
by Antonio on April 19, 2007.

00:08:40.609 --> 00:08:43.590 align:middle line:84%
Also, here I made the
analysis of the edges.

00:08:43.590 --> 00:08:46.560 align:middle line:90%
And indeed, these are very thin.

00:08:46.560 --> 00:08:49.110 align:middle line:84%
In another case, here
is a large object

00:08:49.110 --> 00:08:51.030 align:middle line:90%
in the sky at high altitude.

00:08:51.030 --> 00:08:53.950 align:middle line:90%


00:08:53.950 --> 00:09:01.350 align:middle line:84%
This is the tubular object
filmed on April 16, 2016.

00:09:01.350 --> 00:09:04.200 align:middle line:84%
Also in this case,
I made a comparison

00:09:04.200 --> 00:09:08.340 align:middle line:84%
with the vegetation
and nearby trees.

00:09:08.340 --> 00:09:13.470 align:middle line:84%
As we can see in this box,
the vegetation is filtered.

00:09:13.470 --> 00:09:17.550 align:middle line:84%
And the edges of the
tree are very thick.

00:09:17.550 --> 00:09:23.760 align:middle line:10%
Meanwhile, the object in the sky
is far away and is very thin.

00:09:23.760 --> 00:09:25.960 align:middle line:10%
Therefore, it is a large object.

00:09:25.960 --> 00:09:29.580 align:middle line:90%


00:09:29.580 --> 00:09:32.700 align:middle line:84%
Here we can see the
stadium where Antonio

00:09:32.700 --> 00:09:34.045 align:middle line:90%
filmed this tubular object.

00:09:34.045 --> 00:09:41.220 align:middle line:90%


00:09:41.220 --> 00:09:45.090 align:middle line:84%
I also made the comparison
specifically of the thickness

00:09:45.090 --> 00:09:46.515 align:middle line:90%
of the stadium and the object.

00:09:46.515 --> 00:09:50.850 align:middle line:90%


00:09:50.850 --> 00:09:56.460 align:middle line:10%
In this case, the stadium
has considerable depth,

00:09:56.460 --> 00:09:59.670 align:middle line:10%
while the subject in
question, the UFO,

00:09:59.670 --> 00:10:03.680 align:middle line:10%
has a more subtle thickness,
like we can see here.

00:10:03.680 --> 00:10:06.220 align:middle line:10%


00:10:06.220 --> 00:10:08.730 align:middle line:10%
Here you can see the
trees in correlation

00:10:08.730 --> 00:10:10.405 align:middle line:10%
to the tubular object
and the stadium.

00:10:10.405 --> 00:10:14.860 align:middle line:90%


00:10:14.860 --> 00:10:23.890 align:middle line:84%
Now let's move on to a
small inserted model,

00:10:23.890 --> 00:10:27.400 align:middle line:84%
a model that has been
added into an environment

00:10:27.400 --> 00:10:29.440 align:middle line:84%
to see how the
thickness of an object

00:10:29.440 --> 00:10:34.300 align:middle line:84%
appears with the reconstruction
of a photo montage.

00:10:34.300 --> 00:10:37.690 align:middle line:84%
This disc that is
already reconstructed

00:10:37.690 --> 00:10:38.545 align:middle line:90%
is completely fake.

00:10:38.545 --> 00:10:41.830 align:middle line:90%


00:10:41.830 --> 00:10:44.170 align:middle line:84%
I studied the
contour of the edges,

00:10:44.170 --> 00:10:47.980 align:middle line:84%
where it turns out that the
edge is much more pronounced.

00:10:47.980 --> 00:10:49.270 align:middle line:90%
So it is a small model.

00:10:49.270 --> 00:10:52.460 align:middle line:90%


00:10:52.460 --> 00:10:56.285 align:middle line:84%
In this case, this is the object
seen from a different position.

00:10:56.285 --> 00:10:59.390 align:middle line:90%


00:10:59.390 --> 00:11:05.240 align:middle line:84%
This photo of April 29,
2011, is from Antonio Urzi,

00:11:05.240 --> 00:11:08.600 align:middle line:84%
in which the UFO has a
much thinner surface,

00:11:08.600 --> 00:11:12.140 align:middle line:90%
but also much more nuanced.

00:11:12.140 --> 00:11:17.090 align:middle line:84%
So it is an object that
has considerable volume.

00:11:17.090 --> 00:11:21.020 align:middle line:84%
I make a comparison between
this object, which is real,

00:11:21.020 --> 00:11:22.610 align:middle line:90%
and the fake one.

00:11:22.610 --> 00:11:24.620 align:middle line:90%
All the parameters are genuine.

00:11:24.620 --> 00:11:27.860 align:middle line:10%
For example, the
reflection of light

00:11:27.860 --> 00:11:29.690 align:middle line:10%
and all the other details.

00:11:29.690 --> 00:11:33.080 align:middle line:10%
Here is the difference between
an object that is fake and then

00:11:33.080 --> 00:11:34.820 align:middle line:10%
created in post-production.

00:11:34.820 --> 00:11:37.890 align:middle line:10%
In a real one, this is how
the edge should be seen.

00:11:37.890 --> 00:11:41.770 align:middle line:90%


00:11:41.770 --> 00:11:44.540 align:middle line:90%
This is another comparison.

00:11:44.540 --> 00:11:48.110 align:middle line:84%
I do the same,
although with a button.

00:11:48.110 --> 00:11:50.270 align:middle line:84%
Because I have seen
how many counterfeiters

00:11:50.270 --> 00:11:53.090 align:middle line:84%
use it on the
internet and say, here

00:11:53.090 --> 00:11:55.790 align:middle line:90%
is the UFO of Antonio Urzi.

00:11:55.790 --> 00:12:00.470 align:middle line:84%
For that reason, I had to
scan the outline of a button.

00:12:00.470 --> 00:12:03.530 align:middle line:10%
>> It is evident that at a
greater distance the edges

00:12:03.530 --> 00:12:08.270 align:middle line:10%
of the objects appear very
thin, meaning if the object is

00:12:08.270 --> 00:12:11.510 align:middle line:10%
of a large size and
is at a far distance,

00:12:11.510 --> 00:12:14.150 align:middle line:10%
it generates softer edges.

00:12:14.150 --> 00:12:16.940 align:middle line:10%
With the JPEGsnoop
program, it is

00:12:16.940 --> 00:12:19.610 align:middle line:10%
possible to determine the
compression of an image,

00:12:19.610 --> 00:12:23.820 align:middle line:10%
to determine if an image is
retouched or if it is original.

00:12:23.820 --> 00:12:28.160 align:middle line:84%
Four different classifications
have been established.

00:12:28.160 --> 00:12:30.860 align:middle line:90%
>> There are four grades.

00:12:30.860 --> 00:12:35.300 align:middle line:84%
The first indicates that the
image has been manipulated.

00:12:35.300 --> 00:12:40.720 align:middle line:84%
There is total certainty
that it is not the original.

00:12:40.720 --> 00:12:44.360 align:middle line:84%
In number two, the image has
probably been manipulated.

00:12:44.360 --> 00:12:47.970 align:middle line:84%
But there is no certainty
or complete certainty.

00:12:47.970 --> 00:12:50.720 align:middle line:84%
In number three, the image
has all the qualities

00:12:50.720 --> 00:12:55.020 align:middle line:84%
to be originally,
which we will see.

00:12:55.020 --> 00:12:57.500 align:middle line:84%
Then there is number
four, which says

00:12:57.500 --> 00:12:59.510 align:middle line:84%
that you can not
determine if the image is

00:12:59.510 --> 00:13:00.920 align:middle line:90%
real or manipulated.

00:13:00.920 --> 00:13:05.900 align:middle line:90%


00:13:05.900 --> 00:13:08.960 align:middle line:84%
This happens when they do
not come from the database

00:13:08.960 --> 00:13:09.935 align:middle line:90%
of the camera itself.

00:13:09.935 --> 00:13:12.530 align:middle line:90%


00:13:12.530 --> 00:13:18.080 align:middle line:84%
When they do not originate in
the configuration of the camera

00:13:18.080 --> 00:13:21.530 align:middle line:84%
there is a lack of
data verification.

00:13:21.530 --> 00:13:24.080 align:middle line:84%
That is the analysis
of the photos.

00:13:24.080 --> 00:13:26.910 align:middle line:10%
You must also do
the experimentation,

00:13:26.910 --> 00:13:28.460 align:middle line:10%
which is essential.

00:13:28.460 --> 00:13:31.410 align:middle line:10%
This is an all encompassing
effort to take the pictures,

00:13:31.410 --> 00:13:36.530 align:middle line:10%
and do the tests, analyze them,
check them, and, of course,

00:13:36.530 --> 00:13:37.940 align:middle line:10%
combine the different programs.

00:13:37.940 --> 00:13:40.460 align:middle line:90%


00:13:40.460 --> 00:13:45.110 align:middle line:84%
What I discovered is that all
the original photos of the Urzi

00:13:45.110 --> 00:13:48.440 align:middle line:84%
case, including all
the digital ones,

00:13:48.440 --> 00:13:53.420 align:middle line:84%
are authentic grade three,
all of them, absolutely all

00:13:53.420 --> 00:13:54.220 align:middle line:90%
of them.

00:13:54.220 --> 00:13:58.750 align:middle line:90%


00:13:58.750 --> 00:14:01.590 align:middle line:90%
Let's take a look at this.

00:14:01.590 --> 00:14:04.470 align:middle line:84%
The result of grade
three for the images

00:14:04.470 --> 00:14:07.860 align:middle line:84%
has a high probability
of being original.

00:14:07.860 --> 00:14:10.950 align:middle line:84%
It is always the same
result, grade three.

00:14:10.950 --> 00:14:14.100 align:middle line:90%


00:14:14.100 --> 00:14:19.260 align:middle line:84%
These images have a high
probability of being original.

00:14:19.260 --> 00:14:21.120 align:middle line:84%
I am presenting
some programs that

00:14:21.120 --> 00:14:24.150 align:middle line:84%
are used to collect data from
the photos that are basic,

00:14:24.150 --> 00:14:26.340 align:middle line:90%
essential information.

00:14:26.340 --> 00:14:29.730 align:middle line:84%
the program can detect
the brand, the model,

00:14:29.730 --> 00:14:32.550 align:middle line:84%
date information,
light exposure,

00:14:32.550 --> 00:14:34.770 align:middle line:84%
everything that is used
and stored on the photo.

00:14:34.770 --> 00:14:39.090 align:middle line:90%


00:14:39.090 --> 00:14:41.620 align:middle line:90%
now let's see the photos.

00:14:41.620 --> 00:14:42.620 align:middle line:90%
I would like to explain.

00:14:42.620 --> 00:14:47.420 align:middle line:90%


00:14:47.420 --> 00:14:49.700 align:middle line:84%
Here is what I have done
with this comparison.

00:14:49.700 --> 00:14:53.960 align:middle line:90%


00:14:53.960 --> 00:14:58.310 align:middle line:84%
I made it out of a real
object filmed by Antonio Urzi,

00:14:58.310 --> 00:15:01.880 align:middle line:84%
and an object made in
post-production, the object

00:15:01.880 --> 00:15:03.450 align:middle line:90%
from Brownsville.

00:15:03.450 --> 00:15:05.450 align:middle line:84%
And I have made
the analysis using

00:15:05.450 --> 00:15:07.479 align:middle line:90%
a metadata of the recording.

00:15:07.479 --> 00:15:13.310 align:middle line:90%


00:15:13.310 --> 00:15:16.360 align:middle line:84%
These are the three videos
from Brownsville, Texas.

00:15:16.360 --> 00:15:20.570 align:middle line:84%
And these are the three videos
of Antonio Urzi from April 15,

00:15:20.570 --> 00:15:23.390 align:middle line:90%
2015.

00:15:23.390 --> 00:15:26.600 align:middle line:84%
>> All the videos have a
record of their metadata.

00:15:26.600 --> 00:15:28.610 align:middle line:84%
This allows you to
know immediately

00:15:28.610 --> 00:15:32.870 align:middle line:84%
if the image has been altered
or if it is an original, as

00:15:32.870 --> 00:15:36.320 align:middle line:84%
in this case that analyzes
a video supposedly recorded

00:15:36.320 --> 00:15:39.950 align:middle line:84%
in Brownsville, Texas, which
resulted in it being a fake.

00:15:39.950 --> 00:15:45.110 align:middle line:90%


00:15:45.110 --> 00:15:49.640 align:middle line:84%
>> The importance of the outcome
of analyzing the evidence

00:15:49.640 --> 00:15:53.630 align:middle line:84%
presented by Antonio
Urzi is significant.

00:15:53.630 --> 00:15:56.330 align:middle line:84%
It is to determine
the authenticity

00:15:56.330 --> 00:16:00.500 align:middle line:84%
of a case that exceeds all
the expectations generated

00:16:00.500 --> 00:16:04.670 align:middle line:84%
by previous cases, only
comparable to the claims

00:16:04.670 --> 00:16:08.060 align:middle line:84%
of George Adamski and
Edward Billy Meier,

00:16:08.060 --> 00:16:10.580 align:middle line:84%
cases that due to
their importance

00:16:10.580 --> 00:16:16.000 align:middle line:84%
are not accepted by many
researchers and skeptics.

00:16:16.000 --> 00:16:18.280 align:middle line:90%
>> [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

00:16:18.280 --> 00:16:21.930 align:middle line:84%
>> Now let's see the
development of the pixel map.

00:16:21.930 --> 00:16:24.220 align:middle line:10%
We know that an image
is composed of thousands

00:16:24.220 --> 00:16:26.010 align:middle line:10%
and thousands of pixels.

00:16:26.010 --> 00:16:29.110 align:middle line:84%
When they are placed
together like a mosaic,

00:16:29.110 --> 00:16:31.900 align:middle line:84%
they form a complete,
very defined image.

00:16:31.900 --> 00:16:34.510 align:middle line:90%


00:16:34.510 --> 00:16:36.250 align:middle line:84%
Let's check the
pixels on the image,

00:16:36.250 --> 00:16:40.630 align:middle line:84%
and its local and
general displacement.

00:16:40.630 --> 00:16:47.320 align:middle line:84%
As we can see, here we have
a disk or a rhomboid object

00:16:47.320 --> 00:16:48.175 align:middle line:90%
filmed by Antonio.

00:16:48.175 --> 00:16:52.210 align:middle line:90%


00:16:52.210 --> 00:16:55.790 align:middle line:84%
The pixels are very
homogeneous, harmonic,

00:16:55.790 --> 00:16:57.700 align:middle line:90%
and there are no changes.

00:16:57.700 --> 00:16:59.770 align:middle line:84%
There are not discrepancies
with the structure

00:16:59.770 --> 00:17:01.200 align:middle line:84%
or the composition
of the pixels.

00:17:01.200 --> 00:17:05.599 align:middle line:90%


00:17:05.599 --> 00:17:08.800 align:middle line:84%
I wanted to start with the
Brownsville sighting that

00:17:08.800 --> 00:17:11.480 align:middle line:90%
is declared a fake video.

00:17:11.480 --> 00:17:15.800 align:middle line:84%
And we will see the
pixels that are presented.

00:17:15.800 --> 00:17:18.619 align:middle line:84%
The object, with regard
to the background,

00:17:18.619 --> 00:17:21.680 align:middle line:84%
shows very different
pixels, as you

00:17:21.680 --> 00:17:23.104 align:middle line:90%
can see in these two images.

00:17:23.104 --> 00:17:30.770 align:middle line:90%


00:17:30.770 --> 00:17:35.320 align:middle line:84%
And we see even more,
especially in this case.

00:17:35.320 --> 00:17:40.550 align:middle line:84%
It looks evident that the object
was superimposed later on.

00:17:40.550 --> 00:17:43.520 align:middle line:90%


00:17:43.520 --> 00:17:46.340 align:middle line:84%
The pixels of the
object with the sky

00:17:46.340 --> 00:17:48.980 align:middle line:90%
form another composition.

00:17:48.980 --> 00:17:51.600 align:middle line:84%
The pixels in this
object are more intense.

00:17:51.600 --> 00:17:57.680 align:middle line:90%


00:17:57.680 --> 00:18:00.760 align:middle line:84%
Let's see the differences
between the pixels.

00:18:00.760 --> 00:18:03.380 align:middle line:84%
You can see how the
background of the top photo

00:18:03.380 --> 00:18:05.390 align:middle line:84%
is more compact than
the bottom picture.

00:18:05.390 --> 00:18:08.330 align:middle line:90%


00:18:08.330 --> 00:18:11.660 align:middle line:84%
Here we compare it with
a photo by Antonio Urzi.

00:18:11.660 --> 00:18:14.390 align:middle line:90%


00:18:14.390 --> 00:18:16.880 align:middle line:84%
Let's see the pixels
of the background,

00:18:16.880 --> 00:18:19.250 align:middle line:84%
and the pixels that
show the pixels

00:18:19.250 --> 00:18:28.460 align:middle line:84%
of the figure of the image, the
image of the discoidal object,

00:18:28.460 --> 00:18:30.650 align:middle line:84%
compared to the false
Brownsville video.

00:18:30.650 --> 00:18:35.950 align:middle line:90%


00:18:35.950 --> 00:18:43.480 align:middle line:84%
We can see how the
picture and its background

00:18:43.480 --> 00:18:47.410 align:middle line:84%
coincides with the pixels
of the image of the UFO,

00:18:47.410 --> 00:18:54.910 align:middle line:84%
and our harmonic, unlike this
one where it looks more open.

00:18:54.910 --> 00:18:57.640 align:middle line:84%
There are discrepancies
between the pixels

00:18:57.640 --> 00:19:02.630 align:middle line:84%
of the external contour, and the
internal contour of the object.

00:19:02.630 --> 00:19:08.730 align:middle line:90%


00:19:08.730 --> 00:19:14.100 align:middle line:84%
In particular, we can
notice the difference

00:19:14.100 --> 00:19:16.850 align:middle line:84%
in the pixels of
the disk and those

00:19:16.850 --> 00:19:24.200 align:middle line:84%
of an object of small dimensions
superimposed on the bottom.

00:19:24.200 --> 00:19:26.490 align:middle line:84%
And they repeated
several times on the sky.

00:19:26.490 --> 00:19:33.160 align:middle line:90%


00:19:33.160 --> 00:19:37.970 align:middle line:10%
The difference is just
enormous, in the quality

00:19:37.970 --> 00:19:40.825 align:middle line:10%
and in the composition
of the image.

00:19:40.825 --> 00:19:47.210 align:middle line:90%


00:19:47.210 --> 00:19:52.830 align:middle line:84%
Compared to a
scale model, a disk

00:19:52.830 --> 00:19:58.170 align:middle line:84%
created by CGI
from a real model,

00:19:58.170 --> 00:20:02.460 align:middle line:84%
but made entirely by a graphic
computer with an object

00:20:02.460 --> 00:20:07.140 align:middle line:90%
photographed by Antonio Urzi.

00:20:07.140 --> 00:20:10.276 align:middle line:84%
It is obvious, and we can
notice the differences.

00:20:10.276 --> 00:20:15.920 align:middle line:90%


00:20:15.920 --> 00:20:26.440 align:middle line:84%
As we can see in the case of
the object created by CGI,

00:20:26.440 --> 00:20:28.610 align:middle line:84%
there is a difference
in the composition

00:20:28.610 --> 00:20:33.320 align:middle line:84%
of the pixels of the object
concerning the background.

00:20:33.320 --> 00:20:36.140 align:middle line:84%
If we compare it, again,
with the object photographed

00:20:36.140 --> 00:20:40.663 align:middle line:84%
by Antonio, here the pixels
present a harmonic structure.

00:20:40.663 --> 00:20:43.980 align:middle line:90%


00:20:43.980 --> 00:20:46.730 align:middle line:90%
The difference is obvious.

00:20:46.730 --> 00:20:48.030 align:middle line:90%
Now we enlarge the image.

00:20:48.030 --> 00:20:56.870 align:middle line:90%


00:20:56.870 --> 00:20:59.030 align:middle line:90%
The image is destroyed.

00:20:59.030 --> 00:21:01.340 align:middle line:90%
The pixels are not in harmony.

00:21:01.340 --> 00:21:03.690 align:middle line:84%
There is a
significant difference

00:21:03.690 --> 00:21:05.210 align:middle line:84%
in the structure
of these pixels.

00:21:05.210 --> 00:21:08.600 align:middle line:90%


00:21:08.600 --> 00:21:10.790 align:middle line:84%
In this case, we
notice the difference

00:21:10.790 --> 00:21:16.130 align:middle line:84%
in the object created
by CGI, and the pixels

00:21:16.130 --> 00:21:18.770 align:middle line:84%
of the real object
and its dimensions.

00:21:18.770 --> 00:21:21.735 align:middle line:90%


00:21:21.735 --> 00:21:23.232 align:middle line:10%
>> Por que?

00:21:23.232 --> 00:21:26.060 align:middle line:90%


00:21:26.060 --> 00:21:28.840 align:middle line:84%
>> Because they
present a structure,

00:21:28.840 --> 00:21:34.180 align:middle line:84%
while the images by CGI
start in a fundamental way,

00:21:34.180 --> 00:21:38.440 align:middle line:84%
with its interaction with the
spectrum of chromatic light,

00:21:38.440 --> 00:21:41.080 align:middle line:84%
allowing the picture to be
created from the brightness

00:21:41.080 --> 00:21:46.930 align:middle line:84%
that enters the object,
and that gives it a CGI.

00:21:46.930 --> 00:21:49.810 align:middle line:84%
Now the difference is
that the pixels are

00:21:49.810 --> 00:21:51.595 align:middle line:90%
presented in a distinct mode.

00:21:51.595 --> 00:21:55.240 align:middle line:90%


00:21:55.240 --> 00:21:59.260 align:middle line:84%
One is created with digital
graphics manipulation,

00:21:59.260 --> 00:22:02.170 align:middle line:84%
where all those elements
that are natural are missing.

00:22:02.170 --> 00:22:05.450 align:middle line:90%


00:22:05.450 --> 00:22:09.190 align:middle line:84%
The light enters the
lens, thanks to a sensor,

00:22:09.190 --> 00:22:10.890 align:middle line:84%
creates an image
based on reality.

00:22:10.890 --> 00:22:14.170 align:middle line:90%


00:22:14.170 --> 00:22:17.770 align:middle line:84%
So when all these elements
are missing in the images,

00:22:17.770 --> 00:22:18.840 align:middle line:90%
the pixels are false.

00:22:18.840 --> 00:22:21.670 align:middle line:90%


00:22:21.670 --> 00:22:24.980 align:middle line:84%
The structure of the
pixels is not coherent.

00:22:24.980 --> 00:22:28.840 align:middle line:84%
This is the photo from
December 22, 2012.

00:22:28.840 --> 00:22:30.830 align:middle line:84%
If I'm not mistaken,
it's a rhomboid.

00:22:30.830 --> 00:22:38.407 align:middle line:90%


00:22:38.407 --> 00:22:40.240 align:middle line:84%
I have made a quick
extension of the pixels.

00:22:40.240 --> 00:22:46.660 align:middle line:90%


00:22:46.660 --> 00:22:54.190 align:middle line:84%
In this case, you
can see how precisely

00:22:54.190 --> 00:22:56.562 align:middle line:84%
the pixels of the
background coincide

00:22:56.562 --> 00:22:57.895 align:middle line:90%
with the pixels of the rhomboid.

00:22:57.895 --> 00:23:00.700 align:middle line:90%


00:23:00.700 --> 00:23:02.980 align:middle line:90%
There are no discrepancies.

00:23:02.980 --> 00:23:06.940 align:middle line:84%
There is continuity,
there is harmony.

00:23:06.940 --> 00:23:11.010 align:middle line:84%
The object was not
inserted at any time.

00:23:11.010 --> 00:23:13.690 align:middle line:84%
In my opinion, if
they were different

00:23:13.690 --> 00:23:16.690 align:middle line:84%
there would be a different
density, composition,

00:23:16.690 --> 00:23:20.010 align:middle line:90%
and displacement.

00:23:20.010 --> 00:23:23.580 align:middle line:84%
Here, as you can see,
the vegetation pixels

00:23:23.580 --> 00:23:26.560 align:middle line:84%
are coherent with the
pixels of the background,

00:23:26.560 --> 00:23:28.540 align:middle line:84%
just as the pixels
of the disk are

00:23:28.540 --> 00:23:31.600 align:middle line:84%
coherent with the pixels of
the UFO background in the sky.

00:23:31.600 --> 00:23:35.550 align:middle line:90%


00:23:35.550 --> 00:23:39.250 align:middle line:84%
In all the tests, with
all the investigations,

00:23:39.250 --> 00:23:40.820 align:middle line:90%
the results do not change.

00:23:40.820 --> 00:23:44.200 align:middle line:90%


00:23:44.200 --> 00:23:49.630 align:middle line:84%
That means that in this
case, the disk is coherent,

00:23:49.630 --> 00:23:53.110 align:middle line:84%
that it is in the same
environment at the same time.

00:23:53.110 --> 00:23:57.520 align:middle line:84%
Like the plants and the whole
context, the photo is genuine,

00:23:57.520 --> 00:23:59.980 align:middle line:90%
and the pixels are not modified.

00:23:59.980 --> 00:24:03.190 align:middle line:84%
>> Another important aspect
when performing the analysis

00:24:03.190 --> 00:24:06.490 align:middle line:84%
of photographs and videos
is the sunlight reflected

00:24:06.490 --> 00:24:08.170 align:middle line:90%
on the surface of the object.

00:24:08.170 --> 00:24:10.060 align:middle line:84%
If it is large,
the light will be

00:24:10.060 --> 00:24:12.340 align:middle line:90%
reflected on a smaller surface.

00:24:12.340 --> 00:24:15.640 align:middle line:84%
On the contrary, on
smaller UFOs the light

00:24:15.640 --> 00:24:19.360 align:middle line:84%
will be thrown back
onto a larger surface.

00:24:19.360 --> 00:24:23.440 align:middle line:84%
>> This is a flying disk
from April 29, 2007,

00:24:23.440 --> 00:24:27.550 align:middle line:90%
and this one from March 8, 2010.

00:24:27.550 --> 00:24:31.040 align:middle line:84%
In this case, they are
not very large objects.

00:24:31.040 --> 00:24:32.785 align:middle line:90%
But they can exceed 45 feet.

00:24:32.785 --> 00:24:35.800 align:middle line:90%


00:24:35.800 --> 00:24:37.180 align:middle line:90%
This is smaller.

00:24:37.180 --> 00:24:39.420 align:middle line:90%
The object is much smaller.

00:24:39.420 --> 00:24:42.640 align:middle line:84%
It can be classified
as an explorer-type.

00:24:42.640 --> 00:24:45.460 align:middle line:84%
We call those objects
explorer-type.

00:24:45.460 --> 00:24:49.510 align:middle line:84%
I think it measures
between 30 feet up to 45,

00:24:49.510 --> 00:24:51.420 align:middle line:90%
no more than that.

00:24:51.420 --> 00:24:54.630 align:middle line:84%
>> The density of the object
is of vital importance in these

00:24:54.630 --> 00:24:55.950 align:middle line:90%
analysis.

00:24:55.950 --> 00:24:59.040 align:middle line:84%
The larger the mass,
the more the possibility

00:24:59.040 --> 00:24:59.940 align:middle line:90%
that they are real.

00:24:59.940 --> 00:25:03.860 align:middle line:90%


00:25:03.860 --> 00:25:08.030 align:middle line:84%
>> All of the objects of Antonio
Urzi present a high density

00:25:08.030 --> 00:25:12.350 align:middle line:84%
because they are voluminous
and absorb light.

00:25:12.350 --> 00:25:16.580 align:middle line:84%
That is why they give a
few points of reflection.

00:25:16.580 --> 00:25:20.270 align:middle line:90%


00:25:20.270 --> 00:25:22.140 align:middle line:90%
Here, we have standard buttons.

00:25:22.140 --> 00:25:25.280 align:middle line:90%


00:25:25.280 --> 00:25:28.340 align:middle line:84%
Here, the reflection tells
me that the measurement

00:25:28.340 --> 00:25:33.980 align:middle line:84%
is 117 in one and
89 and the other,

00:25:33.980 --> 00:25:41.210 align:middle line:84%
while Antonio's recordings reach
a density of 15, 17, and 20.

00:25:41.210 --> 00:25:43.740 align:middle line:84%
When they are suspect, it's
usually a large measurement

00:25:43.740 --> 00:25:44.540 align:middle line:90%
of the object.

00:25:44.540 --> 00:25:48.250 align:middle line:90%


00:25:48.250 --> 00:25:54.680 align:middle line:10%
>> [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

00:25:54.680 --> 00:25:58.465 align:middle line:84%
>> I will show a scale that
shows a value from zero to 55.

00:25:58.465 --> 00:26:02.390 align:middle line:90%


00:26:02.390 --> 00:26:06.620 align:middle line:84%
When it approaches 255,
that is the maximum amount

00:26:06.620 --> 00:26:08.900 align:middle line:90%
of illumination.

00:26:08.900 --> 00:26:10.910 align:middle line:84%
Also, the reflection
and absorption

00:26:10.910 --> 00:26:12.800 align:middle line:90%
are minor, and vise versa.

00:26:12.800 --> 00:26:15.815 align:middle line:90%


00:26:15.815 --> 00:26:19.520 align:middle line:84%
This is a parameter to
determine if the object is

00:26:19.520 --> 00:26:24.920 align:middle line:84%
reflecting light in major
quantities or absorbing light.

00:26:24.920 --> 00:26:28.970 align:middle line:90%


00:26:28.970 --> 00:26:32.090 align:middle line:84%
An object of small
dimensions reflects

00:26:32.090 --> 00:26:37.820 align:middle line:84%
much more light with density,
and absorption is nothing.

00:26:37.820 --> 00:26:41.600 align:middle line:84%
Meanwhile, if the object
is bigger, is more dense,

00:26:41.600 --> 00:26:42.920 align:middle line:90%
it absorbs more light.

00:26:42.920 --> 00:26:47.410 align:middle line:90%


00:26:47.410 --> 00:26:50.290 align:middle line:84%
In this case, it
is a small button

00:26:50.290 --> 00:26:53.910 align:middle line:84%
that is completely
illuminated by light.

00:26:53.910 --> 00:26:56.510 align:middle line:84%
More light is
reflected in comparison

00:26:56.510 --> 00:26:57.445 align:middle line:90%
with a larger object.

00:26:57.445 --> 00:27:00.520 align:middle line:90%


00:27:00.520 --> 00:27:04.720 align:middle line:84%
To clarify, if the object
is bigger, is more dense,

00:27:04.720 --> 00:27:05.910 align:middle line:90%
it absorbs more light.

00:27:05.910 --> 00:27:09.170 align:middle line:90%


00:27:09.170 --> 00:27:12.130 align:middle line:84%
Here we we're going
to calculate the area.

00:27:12.130 --> 00:27:15.580 align:middle line:84%
And we see that the
density of the object

00:27:15.580 --> 00:27:17.860 align:middle line:90%
is more or less similar.

00:27:17.860 --> 00:27:22.050 align:middle line:84%
They are very similar in
the form of their structure.

00:27:22.050 --> 00:27:23.890 align:middle line:84%
Let's look at the
one on the left,

00:27:23.890 --> 00:27:26.440 align:middle line:84%
comparing it with the
one on the right, which

00:27:26.440 --> 00:27:34.390 align:middle line:84%
shows 24, then very close
to zero, and then 34.

00:27:34.390 --> 00:27:38.410 align:middle line:84%
A minimum of seven
and a maximum of 160--

00:27:38.410 --> 00:27:41.860 align:middle line:84%
these are the minimum and
maximum of extreme values,

00:27:41.860 --> 00:27:44.990 align:middle line:90%
and the average is 19.

00:27:44.990 --> 00:27:47.530 align:middle line:84%
They are not extreme,
therefore, they

00:27:47.530 --> 00:27:50.260 align:middle line:84%
are the lightest points
of the object, which

00:27:50.260 --> 00:27:54.740 align:middle line:84%
means that it is not a printed
object over another one,

00:27:54.740 --> 00:27:58.540 align:middle line:84%
and there is a volume
because there are variations

00:27:58.540 --> 00:28:00.250 align:middle line:90%
in tone and reflection.

00:28:00.250 --> 00:28:03.340 align:middle line:90%


00:28:03.340 --> 00:28:11.760 align:middle line:10%
>> [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

00:28:11.760 --> 00:28:12.730 align:middle line:90%
>> No.

00:28:12.730 --> 00:28:14.830 align:middle line:84%
These two are totally
different because they

00:28:14.830 --> 00:28:17.110 align:middle line:90%
have varied shapes.

00:28:17.110 --> 00:28:18.940 align:middle line:84%
The details are
different, which you

00:28:18.940 --> 00:28:20.710 align:middle line:84%
can see in the underneath
of the objects.

00:28:20.710 --> 00:28:25.210 align:middle line:90%


00:28:25.210 --> 00:28:26.470 align:middle line:90%
This is the same object.

00:28:26.470 --> 00:28:29.470 align:middle line:90%


00:28:29.470 --> 00:28:34.810 align:middle line:84%
I used this area to make the
densitometery calculation.

00:28:34.810 --> 00:28:37.120 align:middle line:84%
It is possible they may
show the same values.

00:28:37.120 --> 00:28:40.070 align:middle line:90%


00:28:40.070 --> 00:28:41.860 align:middle line:84%
I believe we will
find the relationship

00:28:41.860 --> 00:28:46.630 align:middle line:84%
with the light, which is
reflected in the same way,

00:28:46.630 --> 00:28:51.520 align:middle line:84%
and therefore equal amounts
of vibration intensity

00:28:51.520 --> 00:28:53.620 align:middle line:90%
are presented.

00:28:53.620 --> 00:28:57.990 align:middle line:84%
Here we see the density
of a small object,

00:28:57.990 --> 00:29:03.490 align:middle line:84%
and one created by CGI, made
with graphical manipulation.

00:29:03.490 --> 00:29:07.060 align:middle line:90%


00:29:07.060 --> 00:29:09.850 align:middle line:84%
It is possible to see
that the values are

00:29:09.850 --> 00:29:13.830 align:middle line:90%
entirely consistent among them.

00:29:13.830 --> 00:29:20.340 align:middle line:84%
In fact, remember that if
the values are close to 255

00:29:20.340 --> 00:29:24.010 align:middle line:90%
or higher, they are rejected.

00:29:24.010 --> 00:29:30.370 align:middle line:84%
The indicated values
here are 182, 123, 117,

00:29:30.370 --> 00:29:36.610 align:middle line:84%
which are entirely different
from those of a large object.

00:29:36.610 --> 00:29:39.970 align:middle line:84%
>> Based on this analysis, in
addition to the ones we have

00:29:39.970 --> 00:29:44.290 align:middle line:84%
already seen, it is virtually
impossible to present a false

00:29:44.290 --> 00:29:46.340 align:middle line:90%
object as if it were real.

00:29:46.340 --> 00:29:49.480 align:middle line:84%
Now let's look at the
case of three buttons,

00:29:49.480 --> 00:29:51.370 align:middle line:84%
that some researchers
in Italy have

00:29:51.370 --> 00:29:54.520 align:middle line:84%
used to try to explain
the videos and photographs

00:29:54.520 --> 00:29:56.380 align:middle line:90%
of Antonio Urzi.

00:29:56.380 --> 00:30:02.290 align:middle line:84%
>> Jaime, here we have the
densitometery of three buttons.

00:30:02.290 --> 00:30:06.250 align:middle line:84%
Three buttons, which
as I explained before,

00:30:06.250 --> 00:30:11.900 align:middle line:84%
have a greater reflex because
they are small objects.

00:30:11.900 --> 00:30:21.310 align:middle line:84%
So the measurement
parameters are 115, 88, 81.

00:30:21.310 --> 00:30:29.510 align:middle line:84%
Considering them here in
this scenario, 115, 88, 81,

00:30:29.510 --> 00:30:32.210 align:middle line:90%
we are in the middle.

00:30:32.210 --> 00:30:39.070 align:middle line:84%
115, 88-- so it has more
light and reflection,

00:30:39.070 --> 00:30:43.180 align:middle line:84%
while all of Antonio's objects
measure between 28 and 40.

00:30:43.180 --> 00:30:47.760 align:middle line:84%
They are objects
of higher density.

00:30:47.760 --> 00:30:51.010 align:middle line:84%
This is another proof
of how small objects can

00:30:51.010 --> 00:30:55.300 align:middle line:84%
be distinguished by mass,
calculating the density

00:30:55.300 --> 00:31:00.010 align:middle line:84%
measurement of a small object
against falling objects that

00:31:00.010 --> 00:31:01.540 align:middle line:90%
have large volume.

00:31:01.540 --> 00:31:04.870 align:middle line:90%


00:31:04.870 --> 00:31:07.430 align:middle line:84%
>> A UFO recorded
on December 22,

00:31:07.430 --> 00:31:11.330 align:middle line:84%
2012 presented some of the
strangest characteristics

00:31:11.330 --> 00:31:15.140 align:middle line:84%
of all those analyzed
by Guiseppe Garófalo.

00:31:20.600 --> 00:31:21.400 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

>> [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

00:31:22.760 --> 00:31:26.510 align:middle line:84%
>> It is possible that we can
realize with the analysis what

00:31:26.510 --> 00:31:29.900 align:middle line:90%
I've done to this video.

00:31:29.900 --> 00:31:33.380 align:middle line:84%
It's not the whole video
that has been reviewed here,

00:31:33.380 --> 00:31:36.300 align:middle line:84%
but only what was taken
to analyze individually.

00:31:36.300 --> 00:31:40.130 align:middle line:90%


00:31:40.130 --> 00:31:44.620 align:middle line:84%
It was examined and taken from
the video in a particular way.

00:31:44.620 --> 00:31:47.450 align:middle line:84%
Here, we used colors to
intensify the radiation

00:31:47.450 --> 00:31:48.860 align:middle line:90%
degree of the object.

00:31:48.860 --> 00:31:51.710 align:middle line:90%


00:31:51.710 --> 00:31:56.000 align:middle line:84%
You can see the frames of this
emission, this energetic fluid

00:31:56.000 --> 00:32:01.970 align:middle line:84%
that leaves the central part,
that rises over the device

00:32:01.970 --> 00:32:04.370 align:middle line:90%
and is continuous.

00:32:04.370 --> 00:32:05.765 align:middle line:90%
The emissions remain constant.

00:32:05.765 --> 00:32:08.610 align:middle line:90%


00:32:08.610 --> 00:32:10.610 align:middle line:90%
It is essential.

00:32:10.610 --> 00:32:13.670 align:middle line:84%
Because what is happening
with this object

00:32:13.670 --> 00:32:17.480 align:middle line:84%
is very complex due to
the way it is working.

00:32:17.480 --> 00:32:22.880 align:middle line:84%
It is rotating around its axis
in a counterclockwise fashion.

00:32:22.880 --> 00:32:27.020 align:middle line:84%
Then, a darker cold area
rotates in a counterclockwise

00:32:27.020 --> 00:32:30.230 align:middle line:84%
direction, while
the upper part makes

00:32:30.230 --> 00:32:36.530 align:middle line:84%
a different emanation in a form
that is practically etheric.

00:32:36.530 --> 00:32:38.865 align:middle line:84%
And that, in turn,
radiates energy.

00:32:38.865 --> 00:32:42.500 align:middle line:90%


00:32:42.500 --> 00:32:47.060 align:middle line:84%
This object is a paradox,
something incomprehensible

00:32:47.060 --> 00:32:49.800 align:middle line:84%
according to our
technological parameters.

00:32:49.800 --> 00:32:53.990 align:middle line:10%
>> [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

00:32:53.990 --> 00:32:57.980 align:middle line:84%
>> These are all the analysis
that I have made on the filmed

00:32:57.980 --> 00:33:00.080 align:middle line:90%
objects by Antonio Urzi.

00:33:00.080 --> 00:33:01.670 align:middle line:90%
They are quite unique.

00:33:01.670 --> 00:33:03.020 align:middle line:90%
It is quite rare.

00:33:03.020 --> 00:33:06.070 align:middle line:84%
I can tell you this, I have
never done a similar analysis.

00:33:06.070 --> 00:33:08.300 align:middle line:90%

00:33:08.300 --> 00:33:09.230 align:middle line:90%

Not that I know of.

>> [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

00:33:13.510 --> 00:33:14.960 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes, very important.

00:33:14.960 --> 00:33:19.200 align:middle line:84%
Because it has many
elements of interest.

00:33:19.200 --> 00:33:22.260 align:middle line:84%
>> This is a case that indicates
that we are facing a new

00:33:22.260 --> 00:33:23.520 align:middle line:90%
reality.

00:33:23.520 --> 00:33:25.770 align:middle line:10%
The importance of
these analysis is

00:33:25.770 --> 00:33:29.460 align:middle line:10%
that they prove we are dealing
with a unique situation.

00:33:29.460 --> 00:33:31.740 align:middle line:10%
Here is a man who
seems to be followed

00:33:31.740 --> 00:33:34.590 align:middle line:10%
by sophisticated
technological objects that

00:33:34.590 --> 00:33:37.030 align:middle line:10%
are not terrestrial.

00:33:37.030 --> 00:33:39.970 align:middle line:84%
Here, it is confirmed that
this is not a fantasy, .

00:33:39.970 --> 00:33:43.750 align:middle line:84%
But a reality this has
continued to happen intensely

00:33:43.750 --> 00:33:45.820 align:middle line:90%
for the last 20 years.

00:33:45.820 --> 00:33:50.530 align:middle line:84%
This could become a
window of communication.

00:33:50.530 --> 00:33:53.740 align:middle line:84%
Another of the videos
recorded in 2011

00:33:53.740 --> 00:33:56.710 align:middle line:84%
is of an object that
appears transparent.

00:33:56.710 --> 00:33:59.900 align:middle line:84%
It was at an altitude of
approximately 1,000 feet,

00:33:59.900 --> 00:34:01.870 align:middle line:84%
and it was still
possible to capture

00:34:01.870 --> 00:34:04.180 align:middle line:90%
these incredible images.

00:34:04.180 --> 00:34:08.469 align:middle line:90%
The date was November 13, 2011.

00:34:08.469 --> 00:34:10.449 align:middle line:84%
We can compare this
image to some others

00:34:10.449 --> 00:34:12.250 align:middle line:90%
that Antonio has filmed.

00:34:12.250 --> 00:34:16.270 align:middle line:84%
It is very similar, although
in this case it is transparent.

00:34:16.270 --> 00:34:21.000 align:middle line:90%


00:34:21.000 --> 00:34:24.715 align:middle line:84%

of Antonio Urzi is a milestone,

00:34:24.715 --> 00:34:27.699 align:middle line:90%
a before and after.

00:34:27.699 --> 00:34:30.310 align:middle line:84%
In the history of
the UFO phenomenon,

00:34:30.310 --> 00:34:34.840 align:middle line:84%
never before has someone
done something like this.

00:34:34.840 --> 00:34:37.969 align:middle line:84%
The abundance and
quality of the images

00:34:37.969 --> 00:34:42.730 align:middle line:84%
force us to recognize the
true relevance they have.

00:34:42.730 --> 00:34:45.909 align:middle line:84%
Antonio has never profited
from these videos.

00:34:45.909 --> 00:34:47.260 align:middle line:90%
He has no money.

00:34:47.260 --> 00:34:49.900 align:middle line:84%
His cinematic
knowledge is minimal.

00:34:49.900 --> 00:34:53.960 align:middle line:84%
He is not even able to
acquire much needed equipment,

00:34:53.960 --> 00:34:57.430 align:middle line:84%
yet they attacked him,
and invent evidence

00:34:57.430 --> 00:34:58.720 align:middle line:90%
to discredit him.

00:34:58.720 --> 00:35:02.860 align:middle line:84%
Not accepting such a case
means that the truth has

00:35:02.860 --> 00:35:06.730 align:middle line:84%
been relegated to the
fringe, and that for some it

00:35:06.730 --> 00:35:11.290 align:middle line:84%
is better to live in the
darkness of ignorance.
