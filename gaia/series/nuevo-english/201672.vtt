00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:32.810 align:middle line:10%
According to the "Nuevo"
investigation on December 18,

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:36.480 align:middle line:10%
2018, a few hours after
President Donald Trump

00:01:36.480 --> 00:01:39.930 align:middle line:10%
signed a memorandum ordering the
creation of the United States

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:43.050 align:middle line:10%
Space Combat Command,
it is evident

00:01:43.050 --> 00:01:45.180 align:middle line:10%
that it was a demonstration
and an advert.

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:49.350 align:middle line:90%


00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:50.310 align:middle line:90%

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:52.880 align:middle line:90%


00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:56.650 align:middle line:84%
>> This was a very important
memorandum that was issued that

00:01:56.650 --> 00:02:02.950 align:middle line:84%
day in December 18 of 2018
where President Donald Trump

00:02:02.950 --> 00:02:06.940 align:middle line:84%
authorized the creation
of a Space Command,

00:02:06.940 --> 00:02:12.880 align:middle line:84%
which was basically set up as a
precursor to a Space Force that

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:16.420 align:middle line:84%
is being legislated through
the US Congress at the moment.

00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:19.600 align:middle line:84%
So this was a critical
step in that process.

00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:23.380 align:middle line:84%
And by authorizing the
creation of Space Command back

00:02:23.380 --> 00:02:26.980 align:middle line:84%
in December 2018, what
happened was that basically

00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:34.720 align:middle line:84%
now the US was moving forward
in having a first tier

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:36.750 align:middle line:90%
Space Command set up.

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:41.200 align:middle line:84%
So that way all
activities occurring

00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:45.100 align:middle line:84%
in space with some kind of
military component to it

00:02:45.100 --> 00:02:48.270 align:middle line:84%
would be under the authority
of the Space Command.

00:02:48.270 --> 00:02:50.510 align:middle line:84%
And this is a very
important step,

00:02:50.510 --> 00:02:52.870 align:middle line:84%
because it meant that
the US military would now

00:02:52.870 --> 00:02:56.260 align:middle line:84%
have more authorization
to go and find out

00:02:56.260 --> 00:03:00.360 align:middle line:84%
what the major US companies
had been doing in space.

00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:02.590 align:middle line:84%
But this has been one of
the big problems, Jaime,

00:03:02.590 --> 00:03:06.280 align:middle line:84%
that in the United States,
you have many special access

00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:07.850 align:middle line:90%
programs.

00:03:07.850 --> 00:03:12.070 align:middle line:84%
These are programs that are
run by corporations on behalf

00:03:12.070 --> 00:03:16.360 align:middle line:84%
of the military, where the
military pays the corporations

00:03:16.360 --> 00:03:19.240 align:middle line:90%
money to do something.

00:03:19.240 --> 00:03:22.310 align:middle line:84%
But then the corporations
do things in space,

00:03:22.310 --> 00:03:25.640 align:middle line:84%
but the military doesn't
know what they're doing.

00:03:25.640 --> 00:03:29.410 align:middle line:84%
So the question of Space
Command provides the US military

00:03:29.410 --> 00:03:32.980 align:middle line:84%
a means of being able
to, for the first time,

00:03:32.980 --> 00:03:35.500 align:middle line:84%
control everything
that is happening

00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:40.700 align:middle line:84%
in space that involves the US
military or US corporations.

Hillary Clinton and her
campaign manager John Podesta

00:04:06.010 --> 00:04:09.640 align:middle line:84%
were constantly
talking, using the words

00:04:09.640 --> 00:04:14.080 align:middle line:84%
"anomalous aerial phenomenon,"
"unidentified object,"

00:04:14.080 --> 00:04:16.630 align:middle line:84%
repeating it several times
in the interviews that

00:04:16.630 --> 00:04:19.149 align:middle line:90%
touched the topic.

00:04:19.149 --> 00:04:21.399 align:middle line:84%

or exhaust columns observed
in the infrared spectrum,

00:08:50.860 --> 00:08:54.030 align:middle line:10%
but that they could reach
9,000 meters in altitude

00:08:54.030 --> 00:08:56.500 align:middle line:10%
in hypersonic speeds.

00:08:56.500 --> 00:09:00.670 align:middle line:84%
Lieutenant Ryan Graves, a
10-year experienced Navy F/A-18

00:09:00.670 --> 00:09:04.450 align:middle line:84%
Super Hornet pilot, reported
that the objects were

00:09:04.450 --> 00:09:09.250 align:middle line:84%
in the sky all day, and made
his report to the Pentagon

00:09:09.250 --> 00:09:11.050 align:middle line:90%
and Congress.

00:09:11.050 --> 00:09:13.660 align:middle line:84%
At the end of 2014,
there was a report

00:09:13.660 --> 00:09:15.820 align:middle line:84%
of a Super Hornet
plane's pilot that

00:09:15.820 --> 00:09:20.350 align:middle line:84%
had an approach with an
unidentified flying object,

00:09:20.350 --> 00:09:21.910 align:middle line:90%
almost a collision.

00:09:21.910 --> 00:09:25.360 align:middle line:84%
The incident was so serious
that an Aviation Safety

00:09:25.360 --> 00:09:27.160 align:middle line:90%
Report was filed.

00:09:27.160 --> 00:09:30.990 align:middle line:84%
Lieutenant Graves said
some of these encounters

00:09:30.990 --> 00:09:35.560 align:middle line:84%
were videotaped from the planes
that followed the object,

00:09:35.560 --> 00:09:38.520 align:middle line:84%
and are gradually
being declassified.

00:09:38.520 --> 00:09:41.610 align:middle line:10%
So far there are only
three recordings recently

00:09:41.610 --> 00:09:44.880 align:middle line:10%

opinion by the Pentagon

00:09:44.880 --> 00:09:47.780 align:middle line:10%
through the program called
"Advanced Aerospace Threat

00:09:47.780 --> 00:09:51.240 align:middle line:10%
Identification Program,"
where these subjects can

00:09:51.240 --> 00:09:52.230 align:middle line:10%
be clearly seen.

00:09:52.230 --> 00:09:55.580 align:middle line:90%


00:09:55.580 --> 00:09:58.880 align:middle line:10%
Finally, Lieutenant Graves
and four other Navy pilots

00:09:58.880 --> 00:10:00.770 align:middle line:10%
told the "New York
Times" that they

00:10:00.770 --> 00:10:05.060 align:middle line:10%
saw the objects in 2014 and
2015 in training maneuvers

00:10:05.060 --> 00:10:08.150 align:middle line:10%
from Virginia to Florida
from the aircraft carrier

00:10:08.150 --> 00:10:13.190 align:middle line:10%
Theodore Roosevelt. All this
has caused the Navy to create

00:10:13.190 --> 00:10:15.350 align:middle line:10%
a classified guide.

00:10:15.350 --> 00:10:18.950 align:middle line:84%
There is a protocol on how to
report what the military calls

00:10:18.950 --> 00:10:23.120 align:middle line:84%
"inexplicable aerial
phenomena," commonly known

00:10:23.120 --> 00:10:29.210 align:middle line:84%
among the civilian population as
"unidentified flying objects."

00:10:29.210 --> 00:10:33.230 align:middle line:10%
May 28, 2019, the
prestigious newspaper

00:10:33.230 --> 00:10:37.340 align:middle line:10%
"The Washington Post" publishes
that UFOs exist, and we'll

00:10:37.340 --> 00:10:40.490 align:middle line:10%
need to accept to that fact.

00:10:40.490 --> 00:10:43.760 align:middle line:84%
UFOs are not the same as
extraterrestrial life.

00:10:43.760 --> 00:10:47.410 align:middle line:84%
But we should start thinking
about that possibility.

00:10:47.410 --> 00:10:50.850 align:middle line:84%
And they are declassifying
little by little.

00:10:50.850 --> 00:10:54.140 align:middle line:10%
So far there are only three

00:10:54.140 --> 00:10:57.020 align:middle line:10%
to public opinion
by the Pentagon

00:10:57.020 --> 00:11:00.710 align:middle line:10%
through the so-called "Advanced
Aerospace Threat Identification

00:11:00.710 --> 00:11:07.250 align:middle line:10%
Program," where these objects
can be seen with great clarity.

00:11:07.250 --> 00:11:12.350 align:middle line:84%
May 31, 2019, on television,
the History Channel began

00:11:12.350 --> 00:11:15.040 align:middle line:84%
presenting the series
"Unidentified,"

00:11:15.040 --> 00:11:19.520 align:middle line:84%
where it has shown the United
States Congress on record--

00:11:19.520 --> 00:11:21.380 align:middle line:90%
this means "officially."

00:11:21.380 --> 00:11:23.300 align:middle line:84%
This television show
had an encounter

00:11:23.300 --> 00:11:26.990 align:middle line:84%
with the pilots Captain David
Fravor of the USS Nimitz

00:11:26.990 --> 00:11:30.980 align:middle line:84%
and a pilot named "Wee
Man," who, when interviewed,

00:11:30.980 --> 00:11:36.350 align:middle line:84%
shared all their experience with
unidentified flying objects.

00:11:36.350 --> 00:11:39.400 align:middle line:84%
This favorably impressed
high-ranking figures,

00:11:39.400 --> 00:11:42.410 align:middle line:84%
both military and government
of the United States,

00:11:42.410 --> 00:11:44.780 align:middle line:90%
and the Congress.

00:11:44.780 --> 00:11:48.590 align:middle line:10%
After this encounter, it is that
the United States Navy makes

00:11:48.590 --> 00:11:52.210 align:middle line:10%
the announcement that the pilots
must report to their sightings

00:11:52.210 --> 00:11:55.980 align:middle line:10%
officially, but not publicly--

00:11:55.980 --> 00:11:58.650 align:middle line:10%
only report to their
superiors the encounters

00:11:58.650 --> 00:12:00.810 align:middle line:10%
that are generated in flight.

00:12:00.810 --> 00:12:04.260 align:middle line:84%
Now we begin to understand,
thanks to this TV show,

00:12:04.260 --> 00:12:09.120 align:middle line:84%
how the pieces of these
huge puzzles are moving.

00:12:09.120 --> 00:12:11.830 align:middle line:10%
This came shortly
before the news came out

00:12:11.830 --> 00:12:14.550 align:middle line:10%
that the pilots gave
their official testimonies

00:12:14.550 --> 00:12:18.430 align:middle line:10%
to the most important newspapers
in the US, such as the "New

00:12:18.430 --> 00:12:21.120 align:middle line:10%
York Times," the "Washington
Post," and others

00:12:21.120 --> 00:12:24.920 align:middle line:10%
around the world later,
where it would be disclosed

00:12:24.920 --> 00:12:27.510 align:middle line:10%
at this important event.

00:12:27.510 --> 00:12:31.140 align:middle line:10%
It was also revealed how
musician Tom DeLonge related

00:12:31.140 --> 00:12:33.690 align:middle line:10%
to senior government
and military officials

00:12:33.690 --> 00:12:36.690 align:middle line:10%

of the UFO phenomenon.

to open and establish

00:12:39.540 --> 00:12:42.090 align:middle line:10%

figures, such as John

00:12:42.090 --> 00:12:46.530 align:middle line:10%

personnel within the Pentagon,

00:12:46.530 --> 00:12:50.610 align:middle line:10%
as well as with Chris Mellon, a
member of military intelligence

important budgets

00:12:52.830 --> 00:12:55.710 align:middle line:10%

so that the great opening
of the phenomenon occurs.

00:13:08.760 --> 00:13:11.970 align:middle line:10%
Undoubtedly, key moments
are being experienced

00:13:11.970 --> 00:13:14.280 align:middle line:10%

September 20, 2019, Navy
spokesman Joseph Gradisher

00:14:24.360 --> 00:14:26.340 align:middle line:10%
confirmed to various
media outlets

00:14:26.340 --> 00:14:28.740 align:middle line:10%
that the three videos
obtained by fighter jets

00:14:28.740 --> 00:14:33.540 align:middle line:10%
from the United States
in 2004 and 2015

are 100% real

00:14:37.080 --> 00:14:41.580 align:middle line:10%
that, with this declaration, the
possibility of any manipulation

00:14:41.580 --> 00:14:43.690 align:middle line:10%
is totally ruled out.

00:14:43.690 --> 00:14:45.780 align:middle line:84%
Gradisher also said
the videos were not

00:14:45.780 --> 00:14:48.940 align:middle line:90%
intended to be made public.

The news in which they accept
the reality of the existence

00:14:51.810 --> 00:14:54.600 align:middle line:84%

The statement, which has been
replicated by the mainstream

00:15:04.740 --> 00:15:09.000 align:middle line:10%

result of a story that

00:15:09.000 --> 00:15:13.350 align:middle line:10%

00:17:33.440 --> 00:17:37.300 align:middle line:10%
of unidentified
flying objects, which

00:17:37.300 --> 00:17:43.120 align:middle line:10%
were detected by powerful radar
aboard the USS Princeton, whose

00:17:43.120 --> 00:17:47.410 align:middle line:10%
mission was to protect the
airspace around the USS Nimitz

00:17:47.410 --> 00:17:50.110 align:middle line:10%
off the coast of San
Diego, California.

00:17:50.110 --> 00:17:54.520 align:middle line:84%
Near San Clemente Island, five
to 10 unidentified radar echoes

00:17:54.520 --> 00:17:58.270 align:middle line:84%
were detected, appearing
and disappearing

00:17:58.270 --> 00:18:03.520 align:middle line:84%
on screens at an altitude
of more than 8,500 meters.

00:18:03.520 --> 00:18:06.550 align:middle line:84%
For two days, these subjects
appeared in formation

00:18:06.550 --> 00:18:08.430 align:middle line:90%
on the radars.

00:18:08.430 --> 00:18:11.010 align:middle line:84%
The objects did not
present any information

00:18:11.010 --> 00:18:14.310 align:middle line:84%
from the normal
transponder of an airplane.

00:18:14.310 --> 00:18:16.620 align:middle line:84%
At times, objects
descended from space

00:18:16.620 --> 00:18:19.080 align:middle line:84%
into the area of the
Northern Pacific Coast,

00:18:19.080 --> 00:18:21.600 align:middle line:90%
off the coast of California.

00:18:21.600 --> 00:18:26.370 align:middle line:10%
Within seconds, objects
descended at hypersonic speed.

00:18:26.370 --> 00:18:29.370 align:middle line:10%
This news would be the tip of
the iceberg, which gradually

00:18:29.370 --> 00:18:34.020 align:middle line:10%
began to reveal the framework
of a complex story in which

00:18:34.020 --> 00:18:38.250 align:middle line:10%
characters such as Tom DeLonge
and his academy to the stars

00:18:38.250 --> 00:18:42.990 align:middle line:10%
were involved, to which Mr. Luis
Elizondo who, for many years,

00:18:42.990 --> 00:18:46.350 align:middle line:10%
has spearheaded the top secret
program, Advanced Aerospace

00:18:46.350 --> 00:18:50.370 align:middle line:10%
Threat Identification Program.

00:18:50.370 --> 00:18:52.830 align:middle line:84%
However, according to
specialists' opinion

00:18:52.830 --> 00:18:56.040 align:middle line:84%
on the subject, it
can be seen very dimly

00:18:56.040 --> 00:18:58.500 align:middle line:84%
that they are accepting
that this technology far

00:18:58.500 --> 00:19:02.040 align:middle line:84%
exceeds them, and that it pales
when presented by our combat

00:19:02.040 --> 00:19:04.060 align:middle line:90%
aircraft.

00:19:04.060 --> 00:19:07.780 align:middle line:84%
Joseph Gradisher, a spokesman
for the United States Navy,

00:19:07.780 --> 00:19:10.810 align:middle line:84%
for the first time confirmed
the authenticity of documents

00:19:10.810 --> 00:19:13.420 align:middle line:84%
on the website called
"The Black Vault,"

00:19:13.420 --> 00:19:16.060 align:middle line:84%
dedicated to collecting
information that the US

00:19:16.060 --> 00:19:18.720 align:middle line:90%
government declassifies.

00:19:18.720 --> 00:19:21.720 align:middle line:10%
Likewise, in an interview
with "Time" magazine,

00:19:21.720 --> 00:19:27.030 align:middle line:10%
he stated that these are
unidentified aerial phenomena,

00:19:27.030 --> 00:19:29.730 align:middle line:10%
which represent a danger
to the safety of pilots

00:19:29.730 --> 00:19:34.670 align:middle line:10%
and also a security
problem for operations.

00:19:34.670 --> 00:19:37.880 align:middle line:10%
The Navy's investigating the
incursions seen in the three

00:19:37.880 --> 00:19:44.000 align:middle line:10%
declassified videos, adding that
the sightings occur frequently.

00:19:44.000 --> 00:19:46.230 align:middle line:10%
Jan Harzan, who
designed and planned

00:19:46.230 --> 00:19:50.010 align:middle line:10%
the most veteran organization
in the world dedicated

00:19:50.010 --> 00:19:53.640 align:middle line:10%
to the investigation of the UFO
extraterrestrial phenomenon,

00:19:53.640 --> 00:19:56.970 align:middle line:10%
the Mutual UFO Network,
whose acronym in English

00:19:56.970 --> 00:20:00.210 align:middle line:10%
is MUFON in the
United States, told us

00:20:00.210 --> 00:20:02.550 align:middle line:10%
about the most recent
declassification

00:20:02.550 --> 00:20:04.980 align:middle line:10%
and what this implies.

00:20:04.980 --> 00:20:08.340 align:middle line:10%
>> I think disclosure
happened on December 16,

00:20:08.340 --> 00:20:12.210 align:middle line:10%
2017 when the "New York Times"
had a front page article

00:20:12.210 --> 00:20:15.840 align:middle line:10%
declaring that the Pentagon
had a secret UFO program.

00:20:15.840 --> 00:20:17.760 align:middle line:84%
If there are people
waiting, they're

00:20:17.760 --> 00:20:19.442 align:middle line:90%
waiting for confirmation.

00:20:19.442 --> 00:20:21.900 align:middle line:84%
The waiting for the president
to step to the podium to say,

00:20:21.900 --> 00:20:22.700 align:middle line:90%
UFOs are here.

00:20:22.700 --> 00:20:23.543 align:middle line:90%
They're real.

00:20:23.543 --> 00:20:24.960 align:middle line:84%
I don't think
that'll ever happen.

00:20:24.960 --> 00:20:27.210 align:middle line:84%
They're waiting for
NASA to announce

00:20:27.210 --> 00:20:30.600 align:middle line:84%
that they found life on Mars,
or some other planet or moon.

00:20:30.600 --> 00:20:32.940 align:middle line:90%
That could happen very soon.

00:20:32.940 --> 00:20:35.190 align:middle line:84%
They're looking
for SETI to declare

00:20:35.190 --> 00:20:38.250 align:middle line:84%
they found a signal from some
civilization billions years

00:20:38.250 --> 00:20:39.090 align:middle line:90%
away.

00:20:39.090 --> 00:20:40.660 align:middle line:90%
That could happen.

00:20:40.660 --> 00:20:42.810 align:middle line:84%
There's a lot of ways
that confirmation could

00:20:42.810 --> 00:20:44.473 align:middle line:90%
happen for various people.

00:20:44.473 --> 00:20:46.140 align:middle line:84%
But I think unless
you come face-to-face

00:20:46.140 --> 00:20:50.890 align:middle line:84%
with one of these craft yourself
and/or one of these beings,

00:20:50.890 --> 00:20:53.656 align:middle line:84%
for most people, they
want to sit and wait.

[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:20:55.430 --> 00:20:57.540 align:middle line:84%
>> At the conclusion
of this investigation,

00:20:57.540 --> 00:21:01.560 align:middle line:84%
the reasons that motivated
this demonstration are evident.

00:21:01.560 --> 00:21:03.420 align:middle line:10%
Both the Kremlin
and the Pentagon

00:21:03.420 --> 00:21:06.540 align:middle line:10%
avoided a confrontation
with these intelligences.

00:21:06.540 --> 00:21:09.120 align:middle line:10%
A combat over the
skies of Washington

00:21:09.120 --> 00:21:12.240 align:middle line:10%
would have exposed the
presence of other intelligences

00:21:12.240 --> 00:21:13.736 align:middle line:10%
in our world.

00:21:13.736 --> 00:21:16.270 align:middle line:10%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:21:16.270 --> 00:21:17.070 align:middle line:90%


00:21:17.070 --> 00:21:21.910 align:middle line:84%
>> I think when we look at that
tetrahedron over the Pentagon

00:21:21.910 --> 00:21:24.580 align:middle line:84%
that happened
basically the night--

00:21:24.580 --> 00:21:28.510 align:middle line:84%
that very night that
the memorandum came out,

00:21:28.510 --> 00:21:30.160 align:middle line:84%
I mean, you know,
we can look at that

00:21:30.160 --> 00:21:33.130 align:middle line:84%
and say, well, this does
look like a warning to me.

00:21:33.130 --> 00:21:34.870 align:middle line:90%
I mean, it's a one mile--

00:21:34.870 --> 00:21:38.740 align:middle line:84%
estimated to be one
mile in diameter,

00:21:38.740 --> 00:21:42.670 align:middle line:84%
or its vertices
are one mile apart.

00:21:42.670 --> 00:21:45.910 align:middle line:84%
And this is something
that looks threatening.

00:21:45.910 --> 00:21:49.210 align:middle line:84%
And it was just hovered over
the Pentagon for several hours,

00:21:49.210 --> 00:21:52.300 align:middle line:84%
and was witnessed
by multiple people,

00:21:52.300 --> 00:21:55.190 align:middle line:90%
and photographed, and videotape.

00:21:55.190 --> 00:21:57.550 align:middle line:84%
And when I look
at that, it seems

00:21:57.550 --> 00:21:59.615 align:middle line:90%
to be some kind of a warning.

00:21:59.615 --> 00:22:02.140 align:middle line:84%
You know, and then
of course, what

00:22:02.140 --> 00:22:04.330 align:middle line:84%
makes it even more
interesting is the connection

00:22:04.330 --> 00:22:10.510 align:middle line:84%
to that 2009 incident over the
Kremlin where you actually have

00:22:10.510 --> 00:22:15.010 align:middle line:84%
what looked like pretty much
the same tetrahedron pyramid

00:22:15.010 --> 00:22:17.930 align:middle line:90%
hovering over the Kremlin for--

00:22:17.930 --> 00:22:18.730 align:middle line:90%
for hours.

00:22:18.730 --> 00:22:20.813 align:middle line:84%
Even during the day, people
were seeing this thing

00:22:20.813 --> 00:22:22.000 align:middle line:90%
during the day.

00:22:22.000 --> 00:22:25.720 align:middle line:84%
So this was, I think,
a kind of demonstration

00:22:25.720 --> 00:22:31.420 align:middle line:84%
of power by some force,
some off-planet force that

00:22:31.420 --> 00:22:34.940 align:middle line:84%
has much more advanced
technology than anything

00:22:34.940 --> 00:22:38.530 align:middle line:84%
possessed by the Kremlin
or by the Pentagon,

00:22:38.530 --> 00:22:42.580 align:middle line:84%
and really basically laying
down some kind of threat,

00:22:42.580 --> 00:22:46.450 align:middle line:84%
some kind of ultimatum,
something about the US

00:22:46.450 --> 00:22:51.970 align:middle line:84%
and Russia doing things
in a certain way.

00:22:51.970 --> 00:22:54.970 align:middle line:84%
>> It is incomprehensible how
such an important event like

00:22:54.970 --> 00:22:58.840 align:middle line:84%
this has been
ignored by the media,

00:22:58.840 --> 00:23:01.180 align:middle line:84%
investigators of
the UFO phenomenon,

00:23:01.180 --> 00:23:03.420 align:middle line:84%
and the Pentagon
authorities themselves.

00:23:03.420 --> 00:23:06.150 align:middle line:90%


00:23:06.150 --> 00:23:09.180 align:middle line:84%
>> It's very interesting that
there's been very little media

00:23:09.180 --> 00:23:14.220 align:middle line:84%
coverage of the tetrahedron
pyramid over the Pentagon

00:23:14.220 --> 00:23:15.600 align:middle line:90%
in 2018.

00:23:15.600 --> 00:23:19.470 align:middle line:84%
I mean, you struggle to find
any kind of media reports

00:23:19.470 --> 00:23:20.520 align:middle line:90%
about this.

00:23:20.520 --> 00:23:23.490 align:middle line:84%
And, of course, the military
hasn't released anything

00:23:23.490 --> 00:23:25.360 align:middle line:90%
about the story.

00:23:25.360 --> 00:23:29.940 align:middle line:84%
So, to me, this is
almost like an attempt

00:23:29.940 --> 00:23:34.590 align:middle line:84%
to maybe smother the issue,
just kind of ignore it, and not

00:23:34.590 --> 00:23:37.080 align:middle line:84%
have any kind of
attention placed on it.

00:23:37.080 --> 00:23:40.260 align:middle line:84%
Because whether
that was, whoever

00:23:40.260 --> 00:23:45.500 align:middle line:84%
was behind that mile-wide
tetrahedron over the Pentagon,

00:23:45.500 --> 00:23:50.190 align:middle line:84%
whoever was behind that has
really advanced technology.

00:23:50.190 --> 00:23:53.430 align:middle line:84%
And that is far in
excess of anything

00:23:53.430 --> 00:23:55.870 align:middle line:84%
that the US military
has at this point.

00:23:55.870 --> 00:24:00.570 align:middle line:84%
So I think this is something
that the Pentagon didn't

00:24:00.570 --> 00:24:05.040 align:middle line:84%
want the public to know
about because it is something

00:24:05.040 --> 00:24:08.010 align:middle line:90%
that could scare people.

00:24:08.010 --> 00:24:12.450 align:middle line:10%
And the Pentagon don't want to
scare people about technologies

00:24:12.450 --> 00:24:16.970 align:middle line:10%
that they don't know about,
that the US military would

00:24:16.970 --> 00:24:20.310 align:middle line:10%
have a lot of trouble matching.

00:24:20.310 --> 00:24:23.980 align:middle line:10%
>> It was possible to get to
know this extraordinary events

00:24:23.980 --> 00:24:25.380 align:middle line:10%
thanks to the internet.

00:24:25.380 --> 00:24:28.140 align:middle line:10%
It is no longer possible
to prevent citizens

00:24:28.140 --> 00:24:30.570 align:middle line:10%
from having access
to information.

00:24:30.570 --> 00:24:32.910 align:middle line:10%
In other times, an
event of this nature

00:24:32.910 --> 00:24:37.290 align:middle line:10%
would not have been known
to the civilian population.

00:24:37.290 --> 00:24:39.060 align:middle line:10%
>> The internet
has many problems.

00:24:39.060 --> 00:24:41.500 align:middle line:10%
There is a lot of
nonsense about UFOs on it.

00:24:41.500 --> 00:24:44.250 align:middle line:10%
You have to separate the
signal from the noise,

00:24:44.250 --> 00:24:45.960 align:middle line:10%
get the good cases,
and separate them

00:24:45.960 --> 00:24:48.910 align:middle line:10%
from all the bad cases, and
the rumors, and so forth.

00:24:48.910 --> 00:24:51.960 align:middle line:84%
But the internet does allow
people all over the planet

00:24:51.960 --> 00:24:55.500 align:middle line:84%
to communicate openly about
UFOs, where the major news

00:24:55.500 --> 00:24:58.590 align:middle line:84%
organizations, in my country
and many other countries,

00:24:58.590 --> 00:25:00.330 align:middle line:90%
will not cover the story.

00:25:00.330 --> 00:25:03.572 align:middle line:84%
So people everywhere have
bypassed the official news

00:25:03.572 --> 00:25:05.280 align:middle line:84%
and said, we're going
to talk about this,

00:25:05.280 --> 00:25:07.540 align:middle line:84%
whether you want to
talk about it or not.

00:25:07.540 --> 00:25:09.570 align:middle line:84%
And so they're openly
discussing, yes,

00:25:09.570 --> 00:25:11.910 align:middle line:84%
UFO activity at
nuclear weapons sites

00:25:11.910 --> 00:25:15.810 align:middle line:84%
and other types
of UFO incidents.

00:25:15.810 --> 00:25:20.110 align:middle line:84%
>> Since 1947, the UFO
phenomenon has been considered

00:25:20.110 --> 00:25:24.870 align:middle line:84%
a secret of national
security in the US.

00:25:24.870 --> 00:25:28.690 align:middle line:84%
Does that have something to do
with the attitude of the media?

00:25:28.690 --> 00:25:33.060 align:middle line:84%
It means, OK, you cover the
event because it happened.

00:25:33.060 --> 00:25:35.040 align:middle line:90%
But then you don't insist?

00:25:35.040 --> 00:25:36.690 align:middle line:90%
You don't go deeper?

00:25:36.690 --> 00:25:39.000 align:middle line:90%
You just let it go?

00:25:39.000 --> 00:25:41.310 align:middle line:84%
>> I think that is
certainly part of it.

00:25:41.310 --> 00:25:43.740 align:middle line:84%
There were hearings in
the United States Senate

00:25:43.740 --> 00:25:47.610 align:middle line:84%
in 1975 called the "Church
Committee Hearings" in which it

00:25:47.610 --> 00:25:50.880 align:middle line:84%
came out and publicly became
known that the CIA had

00:25:50.880 --> 00:25:54.100 align:middle line:84%
infiltrated many of the media
organizations in my country,

00:25:54.100 --> 00:25:57.360 align:middle line:84%
including the "New York
Times," "Time" magazine,

00:25:57.360 --> 00:25:59.100 align:middle line:84%
"CBS News" were
the ones that were

00:25:59.100 --> 00:26:01.590 align:middle line:90%
named in these panels hearings.

00:26:01.590 --> 00:26:05.040 align:middle line:84%
Clearly, what you had is
cooperation between the news

00:26:05.040 --> 00:26:09.120 align:middle line:84%
organizations and the CIA
on national security issues.

00:26:09.120 --> 00:26:13.620 align:middle line:84%
There was no explicit mention
of UFOs in these hearings.

00:26:13.620 --> 00:26:16.770 align:middle line:84%
But what you have is,
again, this situation

00:26:16.770 --> 00:26:19.710 align:middle line:84%
where the government is saying
to the mainstream media,

00:26:19.710 --> 00:26:21.720 align:middle line:84%
the big, big players,
the "New York Times,"

00:26:21.720 --> 00:26:25.030 align:middle line:84%
the "Washington Post,"
this is national security.

00:26:25.030 --> 00:26:28.740 align:middle line:84%
So very rarely do you
find stories about UFOs.

00:26:28.740 --> 00:26:32.880 align:middle line:84%
And in 1979, a rare
exception of that happened.

00:26:32.880 --> 00:26:37.410 align:middle line:84%
In January of '79, the
"Washington Post"--

00:26:37.410 --> 00:26:39.630 align:middle line:84%
the "Washington Post"--
on its front page

00:26:39.630 --> 00:26:43.500 align:middle line:84%
had a story about UFOs hovering
above nuclear missile sites.

00:26:43.500 --> 00:26:47.550 align:middle line:84%
That is the last story that has
taken place and been published

00:26:47.550 --> 00:26:50.580 align:middle line:84%
in the "Washington Post"
about UFOs hovering over

00:26:50.580 --> 00:26:52.860 align:middle line:90%
nuclear weapons, even though--

00:26:52.860 --> 00:26:55.800 align:middle line:84%
>> Edgar Mitchell, the sixth
man to walk on the moon,

00:26:55.800 --> 00:26:58.980 align:middle line:90%
died on February 4, 2016.

00:26:58.980 --> 00:27:00.960 align:middle line:84%
But he left us a
message that takes

00:27:00.960 --> 00:27:03.855 align:middle line:84%
a special relevance in the
face of the latest events.

00:27:03.855 --> 00:27:06.380 align:middle line:90%


00:27:06.380 --> 00:27:11.290 align:middle line:10%
>> I have been totally opposed
to weapons in space since

00:27:11.290 --> 00:27:12.940 align:middle line:10%
the very beginning.

00:27:12.940 --> 00:27:17.680 align:middle line:10%
Now, we do use observation
platforms in space,

00:27:17.680 --> 00:27:19.465 align:middle line:10%
but what I mean is
active weaponry.

00:27:19.465 --> 00:27:22.610 align:middle line:90%


00:27:22.610 --> 00:27:25.140 align:middle line:84%
I think that active
weaponry in space

00:27:25.140 --> 00:27:27.070 align:middle line:90%
is a sure way to begin war.

00:27:27.070 --> 00:27:29.050 align:middle line:84%
Because what the
civilized nation

00:27:29.050 --> 00:27:33.560 align:middle line:84%
is going to allow a
weapon orbiting overhead?

00:27:33.560 --> 00:27:36.220 align:middle line:84%
It could cause destruction
at a moment's notice.

00:27:36.220 --> 00:27:38.428 align:middle line:84%
The first thing they're
going to do is shoot it down.

00:27:38.428 --> 00:27:41.320 align:middle line:84%
So you're putting a hair
trigger on confrontation,

00:27:41.320 --> 00:27:43.930 align:middle line:84%
and in particular, a
nuclear confrontation when

00:27:43.930 --> 00:27:46.040 align:middle line:90%
you have weapons in space.

00:27:46.040 --> 00:27:49.300 align:middle line:84%
So it's vital that the
nations of the world

00:27:49.300 --> 00:27:52.360 align:middle line:84%
agree not to have
weapons in space,

00:27:52.360 --> 00:27:55.770 align:middle line:84%
and that the United Nations
be the lead, take the lead,

00:27:55.770 --> 00:27:58.690 align:middle line:84%
and keeping this
from happening, if we

00:27:58.690 --> 00:28:01.780 align:middle line:84%
want to survive, to
ensure the survival

00:28:01.780 --> 00:28:04.561 align:middle line:90%
of our planetary civilization.

00:28:04.561 --> 00:28:07.510 align:middle line:10%

00:28:07.510 --> 00:28:10.720 align:middle line:84%
>> This story will
remain for history.

00:28:10.720 --> 00:28:12.450 align:middle line:90%
The facts are real.

00:28:12.450 --> 00:28:15.010 align:middle line:90%
The witnesses are authentic.

00:28:15.010 --> 00:28:16.960 align:middle line:90%
The images are true.

00:28:16.960 --> 00:28:20.650 align:middle line:84%
And it will surely
happen again very soon.

00:28:20.650 --> 00:28:22.840 align:middle line:84%
A demonstration
like this will not

00:28:22.840 --> 00:28:26.440 align:middle line:84%
take place at dawn,
but in broad daylight,

00:28:26.440 --> 00:28:30.310 align:middle line:84%
in front of thousands or
possibly millions of people,

00:28:30.310 --> 00:28:31.735 align:middle line:90%
on television.

00:28:31.735 --> 00:28:34.690 align:middle line:84%
We are living through
extraordinary times.

00:28:34.690 --> 00:28:37.420 align:middle line:84%
Very soon the discovery
of life on Mars

00:28:37.420 --> 00:28:42.050 align:middle line:84%
will be announced, and
later on, in other worlds

00:28:42.050 --> 00:28:44.600 align:middle line:90%
it is only a matter of time.
