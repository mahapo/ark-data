in my life, especially
when I had the opportunity

essential inner maturity.

00:06:59.750 --> 00:07:01.730 align:middle line:84%
I knew that these beings
revealed themselves

00:07:01.730 --> 00:07:05.720 align:middle line:90%
for some extraordinary reason.

00:07:05.720 --> 00:07:08.150 align:middle line:84%
That is why coming
back here reminds me

00:07:08.150 --> 00:07:13.730 align:middle line:84%
of those beautiful memories
of lights and objects

00:07:13.730 --> 00:07:16.970 align:middle line:90%
that I saw in my youth.

00:07:16.970 --> 00:07:18.860 align:middle line:84%
Over time, we have come
to know that there's

00:07:18.860 --> 00:07:20.165 align:middle line:90%
a variety of these objects.

00:07:22.800 --> 00:07:26.990 align:middle line:84%
The ones I saw here are part
of classic examples, which

00:07:26.990 --> 00:07:29.000 align:middle line:84%
have been observed in
many parts of the world

00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:31.760 align:middle line:90%
by numerous witnesses.

00:07:31.760 --> 00:07:33.890 align:middle line:84%
During that time, there
were unknown facts.

00:07:36.620 --> 00:07:40.560 align:middle line:84%
We came here every
day to the same place,

00:07:40.560 --> 00:07:44.210 align:middle line:84%
and I remember that we saw two
and sometimes four luminous

00:07:44.210 --> 00:07:47.240 align:middle line:90%
objects flying over us.

00:07:47.240 --> 00:07:49.520 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes we stayed
for an hour standing,

00:07:49.520 --> 00:07:52.160 align:middle line:84%
and then lights and objects
of different shapes and sizes

00:07:52.160 --> 00:07:52.960 align:middle line:90%
appeared.

00:07:52.960 --> 00:07:56.040 align:middle line:90%


00:07:56.040 --> 00:07:58.320 align:middle line:84%
We also saw a
triangular light which

00:07:58.320 --> 00:08:04.410 align:middle line:84%
describes the UFOs
that Carlos Diaz saw,

00:08:04.410 --> 00:08:07.530 align:middle line:90%
and that is very important.

00:08:07.530 --> 00:08:09.330 align:middle line:84%
Remember that we were
just a group of three

00:08:09.330 --> 00:08:10.960 align:middle line:84%
or four boys standing
in this place

00:08:10.960 --> 00:08:12.210 align:middle line:90%

00:08:15.040 --> 00:08:16.680 align:middle line:84%
And sometimes people
would pass by,

00:08:16.680 --> 00:08:21.220 align:middle line:84%
and we wanted them to see
the flying lights too.

00:08:21.220 --> 00:08:23.220 align:middle line:84%
Almost nobody stopped
because they thought maybe

00:08:23.220 --> 00:08:26.100 align:middle line:90%
we would try to assault them.

00:08:26.100 --> 00:08:28.815 align:middle line:84%
Nevertheless, many people
did witness those events.

lived in this area

00:08:34.780 --> 00:08:37.860 align:middle line:84%
also had memories of seeing
similar things for a long time.

00:08:45.190 --> 00:08:48.130 align:middle line:84%
10 years later,
I moved to Milan,

00:08:48.130 --> 00:08:51.850 align:middle line:84%
but still this place remains in

began, and would continue
at my house in Livorno.

00:20:16.840 --> 00:20:22.520 align:middle line:84%
and Antonio told me, mom,
look what's up there.

00:20:22.520 --> 00:20:23.980 align:middle line:90%
I told him, it's a plane.

00:20:23.980 --> 00:20:27.940 align:middle line:84%
And he said, no, the
plane is over there.

00:20:27.940 --> 00:20:32.980 align:middle line:84%
It seems that there is something
that always follows him.

at the sky.

00:20:54.610 --> 00:20:56.530 align:middle line:84%
Personally, I'm not
someone who spends

00:20:56.530 --> 00:20:59.410 align:middle line:90%
a lot of time doing that.

00:20:59.410 --> 00:21:04.900 align:middle line:84%
One day, I went to the terrace
because Antonio was there,

00:21:04.900 --> 00:21:08.620 align:middle line:84%
and as always, he was absorbed
in looking at the sky.

00:21:08.620 --> 00:21:14.330 align:middle line:90%


00:21:14.330 --> 00:21:18.120 align:middle line:84%
He told me that
he had seen a UFO.

00:21:18.120 --> 00:21:21.400 align:middle line:84%
I thought it was
just his imagination.

00:21:21.400 --> 00:21:23.950 align:middle line:84%
I think most children
his age do not spend

00:21:23.950 --> 00:21:26.480 align:middle line:90%
time doing this sort of thing.

00:21:26.480 --> 00:21:28.540 align:middle line:90%
But for him, it was his passion.

It was not that we did not
going to believe him, my wife

his age were playing soccer.

00:21:47.530 --> 00:21:49.930 align:middle line:84%
Actually, I was
surprised that he was not

00:21:49.930 --> 00:21:53.350 align:middle line:84%
more interested in
those kind of games.

00:21:53.350 --> 00:22:02.440 align:middle line:84%
One morning, he was
waiting for the school bus,

00:22:02.440 --> 00:22:07.080 align:middle line:84%
suddenly, he came back to
the house and told my wife,

00:22:07.080 --> 00:22:09.940 align:middle line:84%
while I was getting
ready to go to work,

00:22:09.940 --> 00:22:13.690 align:middle line:84%
I saw this huge beam of
light, and I followed it

00:22:13.690 --> 00:22:14.916 align:middle line:90%
until it disappeared.

00:22:18.370 --> 00:22:20.650 align:middle line:84%
It was not a plane,
because he pointed

in the opposite direction
of the Piza airport.
