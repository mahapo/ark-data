saw an extraterrestrial

From that ship,
a few days later,

00:00:55.940 --> 00:00:58.130 align:middle line:84%
they would extract
a piece of metal

00:00:58.130 --> 00:01:02.420 align:middle line:84%
that has been kept hidden
for more than 70 years

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:05.250 align:middle line:90%

month after an atomic bomb was

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:20.360 align:middle line:84%
detonated in a place known
as Trinity in New Mexico,

00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:25.240 align:middle line:84%
only 15 kilometers away on the
property of the Padilla family,

00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:26.885 align:middle line:90%
a ship fell from space.

00:01:26.885 --> 00:01:30.330 align:middle line:90%


00:01:30.330 --> 00:01:33.890 align:middle line:84%
The ship measured about five
meters in height and 10 meters

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:35.280 align:middle line:90%
in diameter.

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:37.820 align:middle line:84%
It came down and crashed
into a brick tower

00:01:37.820 --> 00:01:41.430 align:middle line:90%
that had an antenna on top.

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:43.440 align:middle line:84%
After impacting
the tower, it fell

00:01:43.440 --> 00:01:46.200 align:middle line:84%
to the ground, slid
for about 70 meters

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:48.720 align:middle line:84%
until it stopped on
a sandbank, which

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:52.650 align:middle line:90%
was part of an old stream bed.

00:01:52.650 --> 00:01:55.560 align:middle line:84%
The object had a
hole from the damage

00:01:55.560 --> 00:02:01.110 align:middle line:84%
that was three meters
high and two meters wide.

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:03.240 align:middle line:90%
Two children saw the crash--

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:08.400 align:middle line:84%
Jose Padilla, seven years old,
and Remigio, or Reme, Baca

00:02:08.400 --> 00:02:09.870 align:middle line:90%
six years old.

00:02:09.870 --> 00:02:12.120 align:middle line:84%
They both observed
with their binoculars,

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:15.180 align:middle line:84%
for almost two
hours, beings that

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:18.160 align:middle line:90%
moved about inside the ship.

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:20.650 align:middle line:84%
They could see that they were
practically the same height

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:22.880 align:middle line:84%
as they were just
over one meter.

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:25.950 align:middle line:90%


00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:27.740 align:middle line:84%
They noticed they
had four fingers

00:02:27.740 --> 00:02:33.560 align:middle line:84%
on each hand, elongated
eyes, and no hair or ears.

00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:36.410 align:middle line:84%
They appeared to be wearing
silver suits which were

00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:38.760 align:middle line:90%
tight against their bodies.

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:43.520 align:middle line:84%
One of the beings was lying on
the ground and did not move.

00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:46.670 align:middle line:10%
Two days later, the
beings had disappeared,

00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:50.120 align:middle line:10%
and the ship had been moved
and was hidden out of sight.

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:53.360 align:middle line:84%
The remains of the
bodies were gone, too.

00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:55.820 align:middle line:84%
This sighting occurred
about 48 hours

00:02:55.820 --> 00:03:01.920 align:middle line:84%
before the Army showed
up on August 20, 1945.

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:04.410 align:middle line:84%
The Army fenced the
crash v and removed

00:03:04.410 --> 00:03:06.300 align:middle line:90%
the remains of the ship.

00:03:06.300 --> 00:03:10.500 align:middle line:84%
For one week, seven military
personnel worked there.

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:13.260 align:middle line:84%
Every day the children
returned to observe them

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:15.060 align:middle line:90%
with their binoculars.

00:03:15.060 --> 00:03:17.700 align:middle line:84%
On the last day,
August 28, the ship

00:03:17.700 --> 00:03:21.330 align:middle line:84%
was loaded onto a military
transport vehicle.

00:03:21.330 --> 00:03:24.510 align:middle line:84%
The men left their truck
and cargo unattended

00:03:24.510 --> 00:03:29.690 align:middle line:84%
and headed to the Owl Bar Cafe
in San Antonio that night.

00:03:29.690 --> 00:03:33.810 align:middle line:84%
Jose and Reme then climbed into
the truck, entered the ship,

00:03:33.810 --> 00:03:36.510 align:middle line:90%
taking a souvenir from inside.

00:03:36.510 --> 00:03:37.590 align:middle line:90%
They hid it.

00:03:37.590 --> 00:03:39.300 align:middle line:84%
And although the
military personnel

00:03:39.300 --> 00:03:42.690 align:middle line:84%
ended up searching their homes,
they couldn't find the item.

00:03:42.690 --> 00:03:46.510 align:middle line:90%


00:03:46.510 --> 00:03:51.520 align:middle line:84%
>> Today, 72 years later, the
piece of metal that was extract

00:03:51.520 --> 00:03:56.530 align:middle line:84%
from that ship and its analysis
are presented on "Nuevo."

00:03:56.530 --> 00:04:02.350 align:middle line:84%
Remigio Baca, known as
Reme, died on July 13, 2013

00:04:02.350 --> 00:04:05.380 align:middle line:90%
at 74 years of age.

00:04:05.380 --> 00:04:08.050 align:middle line:84%
Before he died, he
gave me an interview

00:04:08.050 --> 00:04:11.230 align:middle line:84%
in which he details this
extraordinary experience

00:04:11.230 --> 00:04:12.820 align:middle line:90%
with his friend Jose Padilla.

00:04:12.820 --> 00:04:17.555 align:middle line:90%


00:04:17.555 --> 00:04:22.510 align:middle line:84%
>> Today, here on "Nuevo," we
present the last interview Reme

00:04:22.510 --> 00:04:27.190 align:middle line:84%
gave during his life, a personal
experience and exclusive

00:04:27.190 --> 00:04:28.330 align:middle line:90%
interview.

00:04:28.330 --> 00:04:32.874 align:middle line:84%
He always insisted that
his story was true.

00:04:32.874 --> 00:04:36.620 align:middle line:10%
>> [SPEAKING SPANISH]

00:04:36.620 --> 00:05:45.676 align:middle line:90%


00:05:45.676 --> 00:05:49.800 align:middle line:84%
>> Remigio Baca, just 6
years old at the time,

00:05:49.800 --> 00:05:59.571 align:middle line:84%
perfectly recalls what happened
on that day, August 16, 1945.

00:05:59.571 --> 00:06:03.230 align:middle line:90%
>> We hear this big, loud sound.

00:06:03.230 --> 00:06:04.070 align:middle line:90%
But it's not there.

00:06:04.070 --> 00:06:07.940 align:middle line:10%
It's a couple of canyons away.

00:06:07.940 --> 00:06:10.270 align:middle line:10%
And you see this
flash, you know.

00:06:10.270 --> 00:06:12.660 align:middle line:84%
And I said, what the
hell is that, Jose?

00:06:12.660 --> 00:06:17.120 align:middle line:84%
Jose says, I hope they're not
testing another bomb, you know.

00:06:17.120 --> 00:06:17.920 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:06:17.920 --> 00:06:20.850 align:middle line:84%
And so I said, ah, I
hope not, you know.

00:06:20.850 --> 00:06:23.390 align:middle line:84%
So well, let's--
now let's go see.

00:06:23.390 --> 00:06:30.020 align:middle line:84%
So we started walking towards
that way, and it was tough.

00:06:30.020 --> 00:06:31.762 align:middle line:90%
The rocks are hard on your feet.

00:06:31.762 --> 00:06:32.720 align:middle line:90%
And it's hot out there.

00:06:32.720 --> 00:06:35.590 align:middle line:84%
You've got, you know,
high temperature.

00:06:35.590 --> 00:06:40.700 align:middle line:84%
And so we went over this ledge,
and we saw some smoke coming.

00:06:40.700 --> 00:06:42.680 align:middle line:90%
So we now we have a direction.

00:06:42.680 --> 00:06:45.380 align:middle line:84%
And so well, maybe a plane must
have gotten down, you know.

00:06:45.380 --> 00:06:47.617 align:middle line:84%
And somebody might
need some help.

00:06:47.617 --> 00:06:48.700 align:middle line:90%
So that was our intention.

00:06:48.700 --> 00:06:50.780 align:middle line:84%
We would-- we made
our way there,

00:06:50.780 --> 00:06:52.640 align:middle line:90%
and we got down the hill.

00:06:52.640 --> 00:06:55.640 align:middle line:84%
And the smoke and
rocks were hot.

00:06:55.640 --> 00:07:01.160 align:middle line:84%
And we started-- we saw this
gouge in the-- the only way I

00:07:01.160 --> 00:07:02.240 align:middle line:90%
can describe it--

00:07:02.240 --> 00:07:05.180 align:middle line:84%
in the dirt like a
big blade had gone by.

00:07:05.180 --> 00:07:08.280 align:middle line:10%
Only this big blade was
maybe like 50 feet long,

00:07:08.280 --> 00:07:14.070 align:middle line:10%
you know, like a grater, only
big and maybe like a foot deep.

00:07:14.070 --> 00:07:16.930 align:middle line:84%
And so we started
following this.

00:07:16.930 --> 00:07:21.090 align:middle line:84%
And then we started watching
debris, pieces of stuff

00:07:21.090 --> 00:07:22.790 align:middle line:90%
on the ground.

00:07:22.790 --> 00:07:24.110 align:middle line:90%
And so I'm looking at them.

00:07:24.110 --> 00:07:27.242 align:middle line:90%
So I look at this one piece.

00:07:27.242 --> 00:07:29.450 align:middle line:84%
Out of the corner of my eye,
I saw this thing glitter

00:07:29.450 --> 00:07:30.830 align:middle line:90%
and flicker.

00:07:30.830 --> 00:07:32.760 align:middle line:84%
And so I reached--
it was under a rock.

00:07:32.760 --> 00:07:34.820 align:middle line:84%
So I reached for the rock
and got it, you know.

00:07:34.820 --> 00:07:35.848 align:middle line:90%
And I was looking at it.

00:07:35.848 --> 00:07:37.140 align:middle line:90%
And I said, Jose, look at this.

00:07:37.140 --> 00:07:37.940 align:middle line:90%
Oh yeah.

00:07:37.940 --> 00:07:39.380 align:middle line:90%
So I looked at that.

00:07:39.380 --> 00:07:41.810 align:middle line:90%
And it was scrunched, you know.

00:07:41.810 --> 00:07:44.660 align:middle line:84%
And so when I put it in my hand,
it kind of like [INAUDIBLE],,

00:07:44.660 --> 00:07:45.500 align:middle line:90%
unfolded.

00:07:45.500 --> 00:07:46.958 align:middle line:84%
And that scared
the hell out of me.

00:07:46.958 --> 00:07:48.620 align:middle line:84%
So you know, it's
alive, you know.

00:07:48.620 --> 00:07:50.065 align:middle line:84%
And so I said,
well, I don't know.

00:07:50.065 --> 00:07:51.190 align:middle line:90%
Said, I think I'll take it.

00:07:51.190 --> 00:07:53.790 align:middle line:84%
So I took it, and I put
it in my jacket pocket,

00:07:53.790 --> 00:07:56.190 align:middle line:84%
you know, the Levi
jackets that we wore.

00:07:56.190 --> 00:08:00.910 align:middle line:90%
And so we continued on.

00:08:00.910 --> 00:08:05.000 align:middle line:84%
And Jose got out his binoculars
and started looking down

00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:06.420 align:middle line:90%
the ways and so forth.

00:08:06.420 --> 00:08:12.620 align:middle line:84%
And we could see that
this gouge went like this,

00:08:12.620 --> 00:08:14.840 align:middle line:90%
and then it made a turn.

00:08:14.840 --> 00:08:17.435 align:middle line:84%
And I says, what the
heck is that, you know?

00:08:17.435 --> 00:08:20.520 align:middle line:84%
What's at the end that
would make a turn like that?

00:08:20.520 --> 00:08:27.350 align:middle line:84%
Anyway, so we got maybe 100
yards from-- close to it,

00:08:27.350 --> 00:08:29.150 align:middle line:90%
as close as we could get.

00:08:29.150 --> 00:08:32.750 align:middle line:84%
Because there's a lot
of smoke, and it's hot.

00:08:32.750 --> 00:08:37.400 align:middle line:84%
The rocks are hot, so it kind
of plays heck with your feet.

00:08:37.400 --> 00:08:38.995 align:middle line:90%
And so we sat there and looked.

00:08:38.995 --> 00:08:40.745 align:middle line:84%
And so Jose looked
through his binoculars,

00:08:40.745 --> 00:08:41.840 align:middle line:90%
passed them on to me.

00:08:41.840 --> 00:08:43.620 align:middle line:90%
And we're looking at this.

00:08:43.620 --> 00:08:45.240 align:middle line:90%
And it looks like an avocado.

00:08:45.240 --> 00:08:47.270 align:middle line:84%
It's got a hole
in the side of it.

00:08:47.270 --> 00:08:49.350 align:middle line:84%
And Jose says, you
know, there's--

00:08:49.350 --> 00:08:52.670 align:middle line:84%
[SPEAKING SPANISH] And I
said, oh shit, you know.

00:08:52.670 --> 00:08:54.260 align:middle line:90%
And I look in.

00:08:54.260 --> 00:08:55.910 align:middle line:84%
And yeah, there's
some little critters

00:08:55.910 --> 00:08:58.770 align:middle line:84%
walking back and forth, you
know, but not really walking.

00:08:58.770 --> 00:08:59.570 align:middle line:90%
They're sliding.

00:08:59.570 --> 00:09:02.868 align:middle line:90%
They like slide back and forth.

00:09:02.868 --> 00:09:04.910 align:middle line:84%
And so he looks at them,
and I'm looking at then.

00:09:04.910 --> 00:09:08.596 align:middle line:84%
At then we hear-- at least
I start hearing some voices

00:09:08.596 --> 00:09:10.735 align:middle line:90%
and such, like--

00:09:10.735 --> 00:09:12.110 align:middle line:84%
the only thing I
could compare it

00:09:12.110 --> 00:09:16.160 align:middle line:84%
was like a Jackrabbit,
when a Jackrabbit is hurt.

00:09:16.160 --> 00:09:20.090 align:middle line:84%
You know, real high-- a
baby when it's really mad,

00:09:20.090 --> 00:09:21.440 align:middle line:90%
you know, and that high shrill?

00:09:21.440 --> 00:09:24.540 align:middle line:90%
That was what I was hearing.

00:09:24.540 --> 00:09:28.340 align:middle line:84%
And so Jose was
hearing that, too.

00:09:28.340 --> 00:09:31.040 align:middle line:84%
And we're looking
through the binoculars

00:09:31.040 --> 00:09:33.840 align:middle line:84%
and seeing these guys and trying
to figure out what in the world

00:09:33.840 --> 00:09:34.640 align:middle line:90%
they are.

00:09:34.640 --> 00:09:37.070 align:middle line:84%
Because they're very
different from us, you know.

00:09:37.070 --> 00:09:41.140 align:middle line:84%
Not that anybody-- you know,
I mean, Ben was very different

00:09:41.140 --> 00:09:41.940 align:middle line:90%
when I met him.

00:09:41.940 --> 00:09:44.357 align:middle line:84%
You know, Ben had freckles all
over his face and so forth.

00:09:44.357 --> 00:09:46.520 align:middle line:84%
But after a while, he's
all right, you know?

00:09:46.520 --> 00:09:48.740 align:middle line:90%
He just another person.

00:09:48.740 --> 00:09:50.870 align:middle line:84%
Well, these guys
were different, too.

00:09:50.870 --> 00:09:55.000 align:middle line:84%
Their eyes were kind of
bigger, and their faces

00:09:55.000 --> 00:09:57.170 align:middle line:90%
were kind of like different.

00:09:57.170 --> 00:09:59.630 align:middle line:84%
Couldn't see, you know,
much more than that.

00:09:59.630 --> 00:10:01.460 align:middle line:90%
They moved back and forth.

00:10:01.460 --> 00:10:03.170 align:middle line:84%
Jose could see a little
bit than I could.

00:10:03.170 --> 00:10:06.020 align:middle line:90%
He was taller in the brush.

00:10:06.020 --> 00:10:07.288 align:middle line:90%
But we're looking out.

00:10:07.288 --> 00:10:09.830 align:middle line:84%
Eventually, you know, you kind
of get used to them, you know.

00:10:09.830 --> 00:10:10.350 align:middle line:90%
You're watching.

00:10:10.350 --> 00:10:11.460 align:middle line:90%
And well, you know--

00:10:11.460 --> 00:10:14.876 align:middle line:84%
and so Jose says, well, shall
we go in there and help them?

00:10:14.876 --> 00:10:16.030 align:middle line:90%
I don't know.

00:10:16.030 --> 00:10:17.090 align:middle line:90%
I says, I don't know.

00:10:17.090 --> 00:10:20.970 align:middle line:90%
Jose says, what is it, you know?

00:10:20.970 --> 00:10:25.200 align:middle line:84%
And I says, well, we'll find out
when we get there and inside.

00:10:25.200 --> 00:10:26.000 align:middle line:90%
Well, no, I don't--

00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:28.330 align:middle line:84%
I don't feel good
about going there.

00:10:28.330 --> 00:10:29.360 align:middle line:90%
And we're talking.

00:10:29.360 --> 00:10:33.030 align:middle line:84%
And then we're-- you know, I'm
getting these images through

00:10:33.030 --> 00:10:36.230 align:middle line:84%
my head and the
sounds and all that.

00:10:36.230 --> 00:10:41.010 align:middle line:84%
And I'm getting these
pictures of tall buildings.

00:10:41.010 --> 00:10:44.080 align:middle line:84%
Nah, they ain't no tall building
in San Antonio nor anywhere

00:10:44.080 --> 00:10:45.100 align:middle line:90%
that I'd ever been.

00:10:45.100 --> 00:10:47.830 align:middle line:84%
At seven years of age,
I ain't been nowhere.

00:10:47.830 --> 00:10:54.817 align:middle line:84%
And so these tall buildings
and I'm looking from up high.

00:10:54.817 --> 00:10:56.900 align:middle line:84%
I must have been in another
building or something.

00:10:56.900 --> 00:10:59.450 align:middle line:84%
I'm looking up high, and I'm
looking at these buildings

00:10:59.450 --> 00:11:00.890 align:middle line:90%
crumbling down.

00:11:00.890 --> 00:11:03.380 align:middle line:84%
And there's cars
down there, you know.

00:11:03.380 --> 00:11:06.500 align:middle line:84%
Automobiles, and it's going,
and there's color to it.

00:11:06.500 --> 00:11:08.490 align:middle line:84%
They're going down
there, wow, you know?

00:11:08.490 --> 00:11:10.550 align:middle line:90%
What is it, you know?

00:11:10.550 --> 00:11:13.280 align:middle line:84%
And I'm seeing
these things coming.

00:11:13.280 --> 00:11:16.280 align:middle line:84%
And then the other thing
that I see is these--

00:11:16.280 --> 00:11:20.450 align:middle line:84%
I used to call them when
I was a kid [SPANISH]..

00:11:20.450 --> 00:11:22.830 align:middle line:90%
There's just numbers, you know.

00:11:22.830 --> 00:11:25.280 align:middle line:84%
And the only thing I could
make out was from 1 to 10

00:11:25.280 --> 00:11:27.390 align:middle line:84%
because that's as much
as I knew about numbers.

00:11:27.390 --> 00:11:31.490 align:middle line:84%
I didn't know--
learned up that far.

00:11:31.490 --> 00:11:35.450 align:middle line:84%
But they would come in
combinations of numbers,

00:11:35.450 --> 00:11:37.790 align:middle line:90%
you know, and such.

00:11:37.790 --> 00:11:40.790 align:middle line:84%
And so you could see them
come through and so forth.

00:11:40.790 --> 00:11:44.045 align:middle line:84%
And as watching, I
couldn't figure that out.

00:11:44.045 --> 00:11:44.845 align:middle line:90%
And so--

00:11:44.845 --> 00:11:46.850 align:middle line:84%
>> And you saw that
through the binoculars?

00:11:46.850 --> 00:11:47.650 align:middle line:90%
>> No.

00:11:47.650 --> 00:11:51.728 align:middle line:84%
I saw it through
my mind in my head.

00:11:51.728 --> 00:11:53.270 align:middle line:84%
>> And you were
looking at the craft?

00:11:53.270 --> 00:11:56.070 align:middle line:84%
>> And I was looking
at the craft.

00:11:56.070 --> 00:11:58.400 align:middle line:84%
And so I'm trying
to-- so all and that,

00:11:58.400 --> 00:12:01.180 align:middle line:84%
and Jose wants to go
over there and look.

00:12:01.180 --> 00:12:03.220 align:middle line:84%
I told him, look, you
know, I tell you what.

00:12:03.220 --> 00:12:04.370 align:middle line:90%
You go look.

00:12:04.370 --> 00:12:06.110 align:middle line:90%
I'm going back to the ranch.

00:12:06.110 --> 00:12:09.580 align:middle line:84%
You know, I don't
understand this.

00:12:09.580 --> 00:12:12.680 align:middle line:84%
But you know, I had no idea
what in the world/ and I still

00:12:12.680 --> 00:12:13.490 align:middle line:90%
don't.

00:12:13.490 --> 00:12:17.258 align:middle line:84%
I still don't have no
idea what that was.

00:12:17.258 --> 00:12:21.170 align:middle line:84%
>> Soon after, the children
took Jose Padilla's father

00:12:21.170 --> 00:12:26.060 align:middle line:84%
and a police officer named
Eddie Apodaca to the crash site.

00:12:26.060 --> 00:12:29.990 align:middle line:84%
He also remembered that someone
had moved the object or ship

00:12:29.990 --> 00:12:32.360 align:middle line:90%
and tried to hide it.

00:12:32.360 --> 00:12:36.170 align:middle line:84%
Besides the shipping gone,
the beings that they had seen

00:12:36.170 --> 00:12:37.055 align:middle line:90%
were also missing.

00:12:37.055 --> 00:12:39.570 align:middle line:90%


00:12:39.570 --> 00:12:45.450 align:middle line:84%
>> Faustino had got Eddie
Apodaca to come over to his

00:12:45.450 --> 00:12:46.250 align:middle line:90%
house.

00:12:46.250 --> 00:12:48.990 align:middle line:90%
And it was about noon.

00:12:48.990 --> 00:12:51.350 align:middle line:90%
And so Jose and I went there.

00:12:51.350 --> 00:12:56.160 align:middle line:84%
And Eddie Apodaca wanted
us to show him and Faustino

00:12:56.160 --> 00:12:57.230 align:middle line:90%
where this took place.

00:12:57.230 --> 00:12:58.750 align:middle line:90%
So we went there.

00:12:58.750 --> 00:13:00.110 align:middle line:90%
We showed them where it was.

00:13:00.110 --> 00:13:02.510 align:middle line:84%
And when we got there,
we're on this ledge.

00:13:02.510 --> 00:13:05.840 align:middle line:84%
And it's probably
maybe like 2 o'clock

00:13:05.840 --> 00:13:08.650 align:middle line:90%
in the afternoon and such.

00:13:08.650 --> 00:13:11.640 align:middle line:84%
And so we're going
down the ledge.

00:13:11.640 --> 00:13:15.110 align:middle line:84%
And I says, it was
right over there.

00:13:15.110 --> 00:13:16.180 align:middle line:90%
But it ain't there.

00:13:16.180 --> 00:13:17.870 align:middle line:90%
You can't see it, you know?

00:13:17.870 --> 00:13:21.090 align:middle line:84%
And so he says, what do
you mean right over there?

00:13:21.090 --> 00:13:23.060 align:middle line:90%
I don't see anything over there.

00:13:23.060 --> 00:13:26.300 align:middle line:84%
And Jose said, well, it
was there when we left.

00:13:26.300 --> 00:13:31.360 align:middle line:84%
And I says, nah, you know,
what's going on guys?

00:13:31.360 --> 00:13:35.010 align:middle line:84%
And so Faustino, with
better judgment, says,

00:13:35.010 --> 00:13:37.440 align:middle line:84%
well, let's go
down there and see.

00:13:37.440 --> 00:13:38.670 align:middle line:90%
So we kept on walking.

00:13:38.670 --> 00:13:40.530 align:middle line:90%
And sure enough, there it it.

00:13:40.530 --> 00:13:43.200 align:middle line:84%
Had a lot of dust
over it, debris--

00:13:43.200 --> 00:13:44.640 align:middle line:90%
probably winds or whatever.

00:13:44.640 --> 00:13:45.640 align:middle line:90%
I don't know.

00:13:45.640 --> 00:13:48.900 align:middle line:84%
But anyway,
camouflaged, you know--

00:13:48.900 --> 00:13:50.040 align:middle line:90%
you couldn't see it.

00:13:50.040 --> 00:13:52.560 align:middle line:84%
The sun may have been
in a different direction

00:13:52.560 --> 00:13:53.810 align:middle line:90%
than when it was before.

00:13:53.810 --> 00:13:56.093 align:middle line:84%
You know, anyway,
so we went there.

00:13:56.093 --> 00:13:57.510 align:middle line:84%
We found it, and
we were relieved.

00:13:57.510 --> 00:14:01.440 align:middle line:84%
Because, boy, you
know, in those days,

00:14:01.440 --> 00:14:02.610 align:middle line:90%
they didn't spare the rod.

00:14:02.610 --> 00:14:04.260 align:middle line:90%
You got a whipping.

00:14:04.260 --> 00:14:06.760 align:middle line:84%
And it didn't have to
be your dad, you know.

00:14:06.760 --> 00:14:08.370 align:middle line:90%
If you did anything wrong.

00:14:08.370 --> 00:14:12.300 align:middle line:84%
If you'd told a lie or
you mistreated somebody,

00:14:12.300 --> 00:14:15.495 align:middle line:84%
anybody was entitled to
straighten you up, you know.

00:14:15.495 --> 00:14:17.370 align:middle line:84%
And then if you went
told your dad, you know,

00:14:17.370 --> 00:14:18.530 align:middle line:90%
Gonzalez gave me a whipping.

00:14:18.530 --> 00:14:19.330 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:14:19.330 --> 00:14:21.810 align:middle line:84%
You're getting
another one, you know.

00:14:21.810 --> 00:14:23.130 align:middle line:90%
So yeah.

00:14:23.130 --> 00:14:27.880 align:middle line:84%
And so they says,
OK, you stay here.

00:14:27.880 --> 00:14:29.790 align:middle line:84%
We're going to go
check it out, you know.

00:14:29.790 --> 00:14:32.717 align:middle line:84%
And so they went in
and checked it out.

00:14:32.717 --> 00:14:34.050 align:middle line:90%
And then they came out of there.

00:14:34.050 --> 00:14:34.920 align:middle line:90%
And so they're saying--

00:14:34.920 --> 00:14:35.753 align:middle line:90%
>> They went inside?

00:14:35.753 --> 00:14:37.110 align:middle line:90%
>> They went inside.

00:14:37.110 --> 00:14:38.940 align:middle line:90%
And then they came out.

00:14:38.940 --> 00:14:41.798 align:middle line:84%
And they were different people
when they came out, you know?

00:14:41.798 --> 00:14:43.590 align:middle line:84%
When they went in, they
were really grumpy.

00:14:43.590 --> 00:14:45.220 align:middle line:84%
You know, they must've
gotten grumpy out there

00:14:45.220 --> 00:14:46.762 align:middle line:84%
because they thought
maybe we're were

00:14:46.762 --> 00:14:48.280 align:middle line:90%
telling a lie or something.

00:14:48.280 --> 00:14:51.100 align:middle line:84%
But they came out and they
were saying, you know,

00:14:51.100 --> 00:14:53.160 align:middle line:90%
Faustino [SPEAKING SPANISH].

00:14:53.160 --> 00:14:56.870 align:middle line:90%
And said, yeah, sí.

00:14:56.870 --> 00:14:59.950 align:middle line:84%
And instead of saying,
you know, he says,

00:14:59.950 --> 00:15:02.700 align:middle line:84%
did you get the
feeling that that

00:15:02.700 --> 00:15:09.300 align:middle line:84%
was bigger when we were
inside than we were outside?

00:15:09.300 --> 00:15:11.910 align:middle line:84%
So it appeared to
them bigger inside

00:15:11.910 --> 00:15:14.530 align:middle line:90%
than what the actual size was.

00:15:14.530 --> 00:15:17.100 align:middle line:90%
And that was incomprehensible.

00:15:17.100 --> 00:15:22.740 align:middle line:84%
I had-- you know, at that age,
I had no idea what they meant.

00:15:22.740 --> 00:15:26.340 align:middle line:84%
>> Reme Baca recalls that a
few days after the military

00:15:26.340 --> 00:15:30.766 align:middle line:84%
arrived, Jose Padilla's
father spoke with them.

00:15:30.766 --> 00:15:34.460 align:middle line:10%
>> When we're getting into
his house, there's a vehicle--

00:15:34.460 --> 00:15:37.230 align:middle line:10%
an Army vehicle sitting
there, a military vehicle.

00:15:37.230 --> 00:15:39.030 align:middle line:10%
And so we went in
the kitchen door.

00:15:39.030 --> 00:15:42.220 align:middle line:10%
And his dad was at the
screen door with them.

00:15:42.220 --> 00:15:44.220 align:middle line:84%
And so we went in, put
the stuff in the kitchen,

00:15:44.220 --> 00:15:46.010 align:middle line:84%
and then went over
to join his dad.

00:15:46.010 --> 00:15:47.940 align:middle line:90%
And so they were talking.

00:15:47.940 --> 00:15:51.720 align:middle line:90%
And so his dad was--

00:15:51.720 --> 00:15:53.550 align:middle line:84%
they were talking
about the military

00:15:53.550 --> 00:15:55.650 align:middle line:84%
coming in and putting
a gate in there

00:15:55.650 --> 00:15:57.460 align:middle line:90%
because they needed to get in.

00:15:57.460 --> 00:15:59.380 align:middle line:90%
And so it's-- well, come on in.

00:15:59.380 --> 00:16:01.620 align:middle line:90%
You know, so he invited him in.

00:16:01.620 --> 00:16:04.590 align:middle line:90%
And a the soldier came in.

00:16:04.590 --> 00:16:06.580 align:middle line:84%
And they talked back
and forth and so forth.

00:16:06.580 --> 00:16:08.760 align:middle line:90%
And finally, they agreed.

00:16:08.760 --> 00:16:09.690 align:middle line:90%
OK, yeah.

00:16:09.690 --> 00:16:12.150 align:middle line:90%
Sure, you know, OK.

00:16:12.150 --> 00:16:13.490 align:middle line:90%
How long is it going to take?

00:16:13.490 --> 00:16:14.490 align:middle line:90%
And they said, aw, heck.

00:16:14.490 --> 00:16:16.780 align:middle line:84%
We shouldn't be there
any more than two weeks,

00:16:16.780 --> 00:16:18.570 align:middle line:90%
maybe even less than that.

00:16:18.570 --> 00:16:22.890 align:middle line:84%
But we've got this
experimental weather

00:16:22.890 --> 00:16:26.138 align:middle line:84%
balloon that fell there--
accidentally fell there.

00:16:26.138 --> 00:16:27.430 align:middle line:90%
And so we've got to get it out.

00:16:27.430 --> 00:16:31.370 align:middle line:84%
And also you know, we need
to do it as soon as possible.

00:16:31.370 --> 00:16:33.810 align:middle line:84%
But we need to kind of keep
things quiet, you know.

00:16:33.810 --> 00:16:35.220 align:middle line:90%
And he said, OK.

00:16:35.220 --> 00:16:38.370 align:middle line:84%
So that was essentially--
the guy left.

00:16:38.370 --> 00:16:39.420 align:middle line:90%
He shook our hand.

00:16:39.420 --> 00:16:42.000 align:middle line:90%
Seems a real nice guy.

00:16:42.000 --> 00:16:44.550 align:middle line:90%
And so he took off.

00:16:44.550 --> 00:16:48.870 align:middle line:84%
And it wasn't very
much after that they

00:16:48.870 --> 00:16:52.840 align:middle line:84%
started bringing the equipment--
a road grater and a low boy

00:16:52.840 --> 00:16:53.640 align:middle line:90%
truck.

00:16:53.640 --> 00:16:58.216 align:middle line:84%
That's a semi with a real low
trailer, about 4 foot tall.

00:16:58.216 --> 00:17:01.320 align:middle line:84%
And they brought the
tractor trailer in there.

00:17:01.320 --> 00:17:05.609 align:middle line:90%
There was people with torches--

00:17:05.609 --> 00:17:07.020 align:middle line:90%
welding torches.

00:17:07.020 --> 00:17:12.430 align:middle line:84%
And they're building this rack
on top of a truck out of metal.

00:17:12.430 --> 00:17:13.650 align:middle line:90%
They're welding that.

00:17:13.650 --> 00:17:17.906 align:middle line:84%
It's like at an angle
as such in there.

00:17:17.906 --> 00:17:20.970 align:middle line:84%
So they're doing what they know
how to do, I guess, you know.

00:17:20.970 --> 00:17:24.210 align:middle line:84%
And so they're doing
that and picking stuff.

00:17:24.210 --> 00:17:27.750 align:middle line:84%
There was probably one guy there
always at the tent at night--

00:17:27.750 --> 00:17:30.480 align:middle line:84%
he stayed back
there every night--

00:17:30.480 --> 00:17:33.300 align:middle line:84%
Three guys that would
work around there,

00:17:33.300 --> 00:17:36.270 align:middle line:84%
working on the trailer and
so forth, and picking up

00:17:36.270 --> 00:17:37.240 align:middle line:90%
stuff and so forth.

00:17:37.240 --> 00:17:40.200 align:middle line:90%
And finally, on the last--

00:17:40.200 --> 00:17:42.600 align:middle line:84%
I didn't go there
every time and such.

00:17:42.600 --> 00:17:44.370 align:middle line:84%
But most of the time
I went with Jose.

00:17:44.370 --> 00:17:46.343 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes, you
know, in the evening

00:17:46.343 --> 00:17:47.760 align:middle line:84%
when it was getting
dark, and we'd

00:17:47.760 --> 00:17:50.238 align:middle line:90%
go up there and take a look.

00:17:50.238 --> 00:17:52.970 align:middle line:84%
But on the final day,
he come and got me.

00:17:52.970 --> 00:17:55.470 align:middle line:84%
And he says, you know, I says
I've been watching these guys,

00:17:55.470 --> 00:17:57.560 align:middle line:84%
and I think they're
just about done.

00:17:57.560 --> 00:18:00.450 align:middle line:84%
Jose and I talked
about a souvenir.

00:18:00.450 --> 00:18:02.610 align:middle line:84%
And so we waited
until everybody left.

00:18:02.610 --> 00:18:06.030 align:middle line:84%
That night, they
pulled down the tent.

00:18:06.030 --> 00:18:07.813 align:middle line:84%
And they used to have
a radio in there.

00:18:07.813 --> 00:18:08.730 align:middle line:90%
They took their radio.

00:18:08.730 --> 00:18:10.748 align:middle line:90%
They took their lantern.

00:18:10.748 --> 00:18:11.790 align:middle line:90%
There was no electricity.

00:18:11.790 --> 00:18:15.540 align:middle line:84%
There was no power
generators, you know.

00:18:15.540 --> 00:18:17.430 align:middle line:84%
And so they did what
they always did,

00:18:17.430 --> 00:18:20.700 align:middle line:84%
except this time they drove
that truck out the gate--

00:18:20.700 --> 00:18:22.620 align:middle line:84%
the brand new gate
that they made--

00:18:22.620 --> 00:18:23.520 align:middle line:90%
and they'd locked it.

00:18:23.520 --> 00:18:24.960 align:middle line:90%
They put a lock on it.

00:18:24.960 --> 00:18:26.460 align:middle line:84%
And they went up,
and they parked it

00:18:26.460 --> 00:18:28.305 align:middle line:84%
alongside the road,
the dirt road.

00:18:28.305 --> 00:18:29.680 align:middle line:84%
That's what you've
got, you know.

00:18:29.680 --> 00:18:31.097 align:middle line:84%
And they parked
it alongside there

00:18:31.097 --> 00:18:32.523 align:middle line:90%
so it would be out of the way.

00:18:32.523 --> 00:18:34.440 align:middle line:84%
And they got in their
jeeps and they went down

00:18:34.440 --> 00:18:37.590 align:middle line:90%
to the Owl Bar and Cafe.

00:18:37.590 --> 00:18:39.660 align:middle line:84%
We would go-- we
would stop by there

00:18:39.660 --> 00:18:42.450 align:middle line:84%
very often at the Owl Bar and
Cafe after they had left there.

00:18:42.450 --> 00:18:44.910 align:middle line:90%
And we saw them there.

00:18:44.910 --> 00:18:46.093 align:middle line:90%
They didn't see us.

00:18:46.093 --> 00:18:47.010 align:middle line:90%
We knew who they were.

00:18:47.010 --> 00:18:49.890 align:middle line:84%
They didn't know who
we were, you know.

00:18:49.890 --> 00:18:54.550 align:middle line:84%
And so we'd see them there,
dancing and drinking beer.

00:18:54.550 --> 00:18:56.492 align:middle line:90%
Anyway, so they did--

00:18:56.492 --> 00:18:57.700 align:middle line:90%
they were creatures of habit.

00:18:57.700 --> 00:18:58.742 align:middle line:90%
They did that that night.

00:18:58.742 --> 00:19:05.640 align:middle line:84%
And that is when we went up on
the trailer and got that piece.

00:19:05.640 --> 00:19:11.010 align:middle line:84%
Initially, we untied the
tarp, and I pulled it off.

00:19:11.010 --> 00:19:13.990 align:middle line:84%
And I stepped into that hole and
stayed there on the edge of it,

00:19:13.990 --> 00:19:14.790 align:middle line:90%
holding the tarp.

00:19:14.790 --> 00:19:19.440 align:middle line:84%
And Jose went in
further into the craft

00:19:19.440 --> 00:19:21.690 align:middle line:90%
and started jerking on that.

00:19:21.690 --> 00:19:22.840 align:middle line:90%
But he couldn't get it off.

00:19:22.840 --> 00:19:24.400 align:middle line:90%
It was strong.

00:19:24.400 --> 00:19:32.170 align:middle line:84%
So he went over to the truck
and got one of these bars.

00:19:32.170 --> 00:19:35.070 align:middle line:84%
They use those bars
to check the change

00:19:35.070 --> 00:19:38.240 align:middle line:90%
when they lowered the tension.

00:19:38.240 --> 00:19:39.990 align:middle line:84%
They call them cheater
bars, you know.

00:19:39.990 --> 00:19:42.350 align:middle line:84%
Most people don't know
what a cheater bar is.

00:19:42.350 --> 00:19:44.190 align:middle line:90%
But that's what he used.

00:19:44.190 --> 00:19:45.660 align:middle line:84%
And he got on m
and he jerked it.

00:19:45.660 --> 00:19:47.100 align:middle line:90%
And he took it down.

00:19:47.100 --> 00:19:48.120 align:middle line:90%
Great.

00:19:48.120 --> 00:19:50.310 align:middle line:90%
So now we've got a piece.

00:19:50.310 --> 00:19:54.180 align:middle line:90%
And he handed it to me.

00:19:54.180 --> 00:19:57.090 align:middle line:84%
And I took it, held on
to it, looked at it.

00:19:57.090 --> 00:20:02.578 align:middle line:90%
And it reminded me of a sundial.

00:20:02.578 --> 00:20:03.870 align:middle line:90%
Doesn't it look like a sundial?

00:20:03.870 --> 00:20:06.635 align:middle line:90%


00:20:06.635 --> 00:20:08.010 align:middle line:84%
That's what I
could relate to it.

00:20:08.010 --> 00:20:09.990 align:middle line:90%
Looked like a sundial to me.

00:20:09.990 --> 00:20:13.770 align:middle line:10%
Anyway, so then we
got out of there.

00:20:13.770 --> 00:20:16.920 align:middle line:84%
He wrapped it up in his
pocket in his jacket.

00:20:16.920 --> 00:20:19.551 align:middle line:90%
And we went home.

00:20:19.551 --> 00:20:22.960 align:middle line:84%
>> Shortly, after finding
the craft the military came

00:20:22.960 --> 00:20:26.470 align:middle line:84%
to the home of Jose Padilla,
looking for something that had

00:20:26.470 --> 00:20:27.980 align:middle line:90%
been lost.

00:20:27.980 --> 00:20:30.790 align:middle line:10%
It was a good thing that Jose
decided that the piece should

00:20:30.790 --> 00:20:33.010 align:middle line:10%
be kept by Reme.

00:20:33.010 --> 00:20:37.840 align:middle line:84%
Reme decided to bury it in a
room of farm tools at his home.

00:20:37.840 --> 00:20:41.300 align:middle line:84%
And then something
extraordinary happened.

00:20:41.300 --> 00:20:43.480 align:middle line:84%
This was not a
science fiction story.

00:20:43.480 --> 00:20:46.942 align:middle line:90%


00:20:46.942 --> 00:20:50.420 align:middle line:84%
>> The metal piece was
subject to analysis in England

00:20:50.420 --> 00:20:51.560 align:middle line:90%
and Mexico.

00:20:51.560 --> 00:20:54.290 align:middle line:90%
The results were truly amazing.

00:20:54.290 --> 00:20:56.510 align:middle line:84%
If these findings
are confirmed, it

00:20:56.510 --> 00:20:59.720 align:middle line:84%
will show not only
that this story's real

00:20:59.720 --> 00:21:01.610 align:middle line:84%
but that we have
to ignore allergy

00:21:01.610 --> 00:21:03.830 align:middle line:90%
from other worlds in our hands.

00:21:03.830 --> 00:21:06.020 align:middle line:84%
I'm Jaime Maussan,
and I'll see you

00:21:06.020 --> 00:21:07.925 align:middle line:90%
on the next episode of "Nuevo."

00:21:07.925 --> 00:21:12.980 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:21:12.980 --> 00:21:17.300 align:middle line:90%


00:21:17.300 --> 00:21:27.250 align:middle line:10%
>> Gaia presented "Nuevo"
with Jaime Maussan.

00:21:27.250 --> 00:21:31.328 align:middle line:90%
