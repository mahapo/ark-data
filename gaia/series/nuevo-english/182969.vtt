there a record of four ships

Between 1945 and 1948 near
the Los Alamos nuclear plant,

00:01:06.070 --> 00:01:11.200 align:middle line:10%
at least four spaceships crashed
to the ground, most likely

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:15.400 align:middle line:10%
due to the interference
generated by powerful microwave

00:01:15.400 --> 00:01:18.580 align:middle line:10%

that were operating

00:01:18.580 --> 00:01:21.730 align:middle line:10%

protection of the only place

00:01:21.730 --> 00:01:26.150 align:middle line:10%
where atomic bombs
were produced in 1947.

00:01:26.150 --> 00:01:30.880 align:middle line:84%

ships came down in the vicinity

plant in New Mexico.

00:01:39.490 --> 00:01:41.800 align:middle line:84%
Consider for a moment
that the three ships that

00:01:41.800 --> 00:01:46.810 align:middle line:84%
crashed to the Earth were very
near to the only place in 1945

00:01:46.810 --> 00:01:50.560 align:middle line:84%
that atomic bombs were
being built and tested.

00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:54.010 align:middle line:84%
As indicated by the only
official information available,

00:01:54.010 --> 00:01:57.160 align:middle line:84%
a memorandum that the director
of the field investigation

00:01:57.160 --> 00:02:01.180 align:middle line:84%
office of the FBI in
Washington, DC, Guy Hottel,

00:02:01.180 --> 00:02:05.320 align:middle line:84%
sent to the Director General
of the agency, J. Edgar Hoover,

00:02:05.320 --> 00:02:07.630 align:middle line:90%
in March of 1950.

00:02:07.630 --> 00:02:10.930 align:middle line:84%
In this document, the
Special Agent informed Hoover

00:02:10.930 --> 00:02:12.850 align:middle line:84%
that an Air Force
pilot had told him

00:02:12.850 --> 00:02:16.570 align:middle line:84%
that three extraterrestrial
spacecraft had crashed

00:02:16.570 --> 00:02:18.910 align:middle line:84%
in New Mexico, that
they had recovered

00:02:18.910 --> 00:02:21.520 align:middle line:84%
the bodies of the occupants,
which were only one

00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:24.790 align:middle line:84%
meter in height, and the
ships were brought down

00:02:24.790 --> 00:02:28.090 align:middle line:84%
due to high frequencies
and powerful radars that

00:02:28.090 --> 00:02:31.300 align:middle line:84%
operated in the area to
interfere with airplanes'

00:02:31.300 --> 00:02:33.490 align:middle line:90%
navigation systems.

00:02:33.490 --> 00:02:37.330 align:middle line:84%
Although the FBI has denied any
possibility of this information

00:02:37.330 --> 00:02:40.330 align:middle line:84%
being true, the discovery
that a third ship

00:02:40.330 --> 00:02:43.690 align:middle line:84%
crashed in the vicinity of
the Los Alamos nuclear plant

00:02:43.690 --> 00:02:47.170 align:middle line:84%
changes the story and
adds additional proof

00:02:47.170 --> 00:02:50.110 align:middle line:84%
that these incidents
really happened.

00:02:50.110 --> 00:02:53.410 align:middle line:84%
Not only do we understand
that the information was real,

00:02:53.410 --> 00:02:57.250 align:middle line:84%
but what is increasingly
evident and continually denied

00:02:57.250 --> 00:03:01.120 align:middle line:84%
is what we present in
our video investigations.

00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:04.240 align:middle line:10%
However, every piece of
evidence, every testimony,

00:03:04.240 --> 00:03:06.790 align:middle line:10%
and every inquiry
has been ruled out

00:03:06.790 --> 00:03:08.800 align:middle line:10%
by the government
of the United States

00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:11.320 align:middle line:10%
by skeptics and
even, in some cases,

00:03:11.320 --> 00:03:13.870 align:middle line:10%
by UFO researchers themselves.

00:03:13.870 --> 00:03:17.890 align:middle line:84%
The actuality of what
happened is becoming clearer.

00:03:17.890 --> 00:03:22.180 align:middle line:10%
The concealment of the
truth began on July 9, 1947,

00:03:22.180 --> 00:03:24.760 align:middle line:10%
and the government decided
to repress all those who

00:03:24.760 --> 00:03:26.710 align:middle line:10%
contributed to the stories.

00:03:26.710 --> 00:03:28.780 align:middle line:84%
In the end, the
military actually

00:03:28.780 --> 00:03:31.030 align:middle line:84%
found a second ship
that had crashed

00:03:31.030 --> 00:03:34.160 align:middle line:84%
near the Los Alamos nuclear
plant, a national security

00:03:34.160 --> 00:03:34.960 align:middle line:90%
secret.

00:03:34.960 --> 00:03:41.900 align:middle line:90%


00:03:41.900 --> 00:03:47.990 align:middle line:84%
>> On the afternoon of July
8, 1947, a Tuesday, I believe,

00:03:47.990 --> 00:03:51.590 align:middle line:84%
the "Roswell Daily Record"
would publish a historical cover

00:03:51.590 --> 00:03:55.520 align:middle line:84%
story that the Air Force
recovered an extraterrestrial

00:03:55.520 --> 00:03:57.350 align:middle line:90%
ship nearby.

00:03:57.350 --> 00:04:00.380 align:middle line:84%
One day later, on
Wednesday, July the 9th,

00:04:00.380 --> 00:04:03.980 align:middle line:84%
the Air Force said it was
mistaken, that it was just

00:04:03.980 --> 00:04:06.180 align:middle line:90%
a weather balloon.

00:04:06.180 --> 00:04:09.870 align:middle line:84%
Your father, Walter Haut,
was a very important man

00:04:09.870 --> 00:04:12.510 align:middle line:90%
in this story.

00:04:12.510 --> 00:04:15.330 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, he put out the first
press release, so I'd say yes.

00:04:15.330 --> 00:04:17.490 align:middle line:84%
I issued the press
release saying,

00:04:17.490 --> 00:04:20.880 align:middle line:84%
basically, we have in our
possession a flying saucer,

00:04:20.880 --> 00:04:23.550 align:middle line:84%
and it's being flown to
a higher headquarters.

00:04:23.550 --> 00:04:26.490 align:middle line:84%
And typically, he would
end any conversation

00:04:26.490 --> 00:04:30.030 align:middle line:84%
about the press release or
about the incident of by saying

00:04:30.030 --> 00:04:32.240 align:middle line:90%
it was not of this Earth.

00:04:32.240 --> 00:04:34.740 align:middle line:84%
>> The statement that the
"Roswell Daily Record"

00:04:34.740 --> 00:04:39.150 align:middle line:84%
published on the afternoon
of Tuesday, July 8, 1947,

00:04:39.150 --> 00:04:43.410 align:middle line:84%
is now a historical
record on the front page.

00:04:43.410 --> 00:04:46.410 align:middle line:84%
Later the US Army
modified it, assuring

00:04:46.410 --> 00:04:50.650 align:middle line:84%
that it was not a flying saucer
or an extraterrestrial craft,

00:04:50.650 --> 00:04:53.880 align:middle line:84%
but that it was a simple
meteorological balloon that

00:04:53.880 --> 00:04:55.930 align:middle line:90%
had fallen from the sky.

00:04:55.930 --> 00:04:59.100 align:middle line:84%
They forced Mack Brazel to
change his testimony, who

00:04:59.100 --> 00:05:02.370 align:middle line:90%
then said he had exaggerated.

00:05:02.370 --> 00:05:03.370 align:middle line:90%
>> What is this here?

00:05:03.370 --> 00:05:11.520 align:middle line:84%
>> This is when the military
in their futile attempt to find

00:05:11.520 --> 00:05:16.050 align:middle line:84%
Brazel, to find the one witness
who could blow up the whole

00:05:16.050 --> 00:05:20.970 align:middle line:84%
story, not only the ship, the
remains of the flying saucer,

00:05:20.970 --> 00:05:27.600 align:middle line:84%
but the very bodies, they found
him and they kept him here.

00:05:27.600 --> 00:05:31.410 align:middle line:84%
They kept him here for five
days after the weather balloon

00:05:31.410 --> 00:05:34.725 align:middle line:84%
explanation was put
out, and they kept him

00:05:34.725 --> 00:05:36.900 align:middle line:84%
in what they called
the guesthouse.

00:05:36.900 --> 00:05:40.080 align:middle line:84%
>> After Mack Brazel was
kidnapped and held against his

00:05:40.080 --> 00:05:42.570 align:middle line:84%
will in this place
for five days,

00:05:42.570 --> 00:05:46.170 align:middle line:84%
he was escorted by the Army
to the "Roswell Daily Record"

00:05:46.170 --> 00:05:50.260 align:middle line:84%
and to the local radio
station to deny his story.

00:05:50.260 --> 00:05:54.480 align:middle line:84%
>> Frank Joyce, that original
reporter who encouraged him

00:05:54.480 --> 00:05:58.980 align:middle line:84%
to report it to the military,
he puts him on the air

00:05:58.980 --> 00:06:02.140 align:middle line:90%
and he's talking to the people.

00:06:02.140 --> 00:06:03.840 align:middle line:90%
It's just a weather balloon.

00:06:03.840 --> 00:06:08.280 align:middle line:90%
I'm sorry that I overreacted.

00:06:08.280 --> 00:06:12.450 align:middle line:84%
And Joyce takes him off
mic and follows him out

00:06:12.450 --> 00:06:15.510 align:middle line:84%
into the lobby of
the radio station,

00:06:15.510 --> 00:06:17.790 align:middle line:84%
and then he sees
what's going on.

00:06:17.790 --> 00:06:21.660 align:middle line:10%
He sees a number of MPs, a
number of military police,

00:06:21.660 --> 00:06:27.040 align:middle line:10%
standing right outside the radio
station waiting for Brazel.

00:06:27.040 --> 00:06:30.780 align:middle line:84%
Well, he's being
forced to do this.

00:06:30.780 --> 00:06:34.770 align:middle line:84%
And Joyce asks
Brazel, why are you

00:06:34.770 --> 00:06:36.700 align:middle line:90%
telling me the second story?

00:06:36.700 --> 00:06:39.900 align:middle line:84%
This isn't what you
originally told me.

00:06:39.900 --> 00:06:44.430 align:middle line:84%
And Brazel, being the older
of the two, says, son,

00:06:44.430 --> 00:06:48.060 align:middle line:84%
they told me they would
go awful hard on me

00:06:48.060 --> 00:06:52.340 align:middle line:84%
if I didn't do
exactly as they said.

00:06:52.340 --> 00:06:55.710 align:middle line:84%
And Brazel turned and
started to walk out.

00:06:55.710 --> 00:06:58.140 align:middle line:84%
And Joyce says to
him, well, what

00:06:58.140 --> 00:07:01.430 align:middle line:90%
about the little green men?

00:07:01.430 --> 00:07:07.290 align:middle line:84%
And Brazel turns back and
says, they weren't green.

00:07:07.290 --> 00:07:10.620 align:middle line:84%
>> From Washington, DC, the
media was ordered to remain

00:07:10.620 --> 00:07:11.650 align:middle line:90%
silent.

00:07:11.650 --> 00:07:13.650 align:middle line:84%
Any attempt to spread
the original story

00:07:13.650 --> 00:07:16.950 align:middle line:84%
of the extraterrestrial
craft and its beings

00:07:16.950 --> 00:07:18.710 align:middle line:90%
would be silenced.

00:07:18.710 --> 00:07:22.020 align:middle line:90%
>> The FBI, stop immediately.

00:07:22.020 --> 00:07:24.180 align:middle line:90%
So they shut it down.

00:07:24.180 --> 00:07:26.850 align:middle line:84%
>> The compulsory
untruth was imposed.

00:07:26.850 --> 00:07:29.490 align:middle line:84%
The story of the weather
balloon was created,

00:07:29.490 --> 00:07:32.670 align:middle line:84%
and people everywhere
were forced to accept it.

00:07:32.670 --> 00:07:36.060 align:middle line:84%
The extraterrestrial
story was silenced.

00:07:36.060 --> 00:07:43.140 align:middle line:10%
>> Something that General
Ramey was able to accomplish

00:07:43.140 --> 00:07:47.250 align:middle line:10%
in getting the press to believe,
that the men who were stationed

00:07:47.250 --> 00:07:51.270 align:middle line:10%
here back in '47, the men who
were in charge of the atomic

00:07:51.270 --> 00:07:55.980 align:middle line:10%
bomb, the men who had the
highest security clearances

00:07:55.980 --> 00:08:00.690 align:middle line:10%
in the United States military
could not recognize a very

00:08:00.690 --> 00:08:04.770 align:middle line:10%
common weather balloon device
that even a five-year-old child

00:08:04.770 --> 00:08:06.180 align:middle line:10%
would have.

00:08:06.180 --> 00:08:08.565 align:middle line:90%
And the press accepted it.

00:08:08.565 --> 00:08:10.440 align:middle line:84%
And that's how this all
had to come together.

00:08:10.440 --> 00:08:14.640 align:middle line:84%
And they had to ensure that
the media, that the press

00:08:14.640 --> 00:08:19.440 align:middle line:84%
completely cooperated because
if the press wouldn't have,

00:08:19.440 --> 00:08:23.978 align:middle line:84%
they would have discovered that
there were many more witnesses.

00:08:23.978 --> 00:08:25.520 align:middle line:84%
They would have
discovered that there

00:08:25.520 --> 00:08:27.800 align:middle line:90%
are many more people involved.

00:08:27.800 --> 00:08:31.670 align:middle line:84%
And it would have
come out to the extent

00:08:31.670 --> 00:08:34.490 align:middle line:84%
that we wouldn't be
talking about it right now.

00:08:34.490 --> 00:08:36.289 align:middle line:90%
It would be common knowledge.

00:08:36.289 --> 00:09:16.770 align:middle line:10%
>> [SPEAKING SPANISH]

00:09:16.770 --> 00:09:20.720 align:middle line:84%
>> My dad was one of the
soldiers or the military people

00:09:20.720 --> 00:09:24.050 align:middle line:84%
that went out and picked the
aliens up when they crashed

00:09:24.050 --> 00:09:25.700 align:middle line:90%
here in 1947.

00:09:25.700 --> 00:09:28.580 align:middle line:84%
When he was starting he
had agent orange cancer

00:09:28.580 --> 00:09:31.590 align:middle line:84%
from the military
from being in Vietnam,

00:09:31.590 --> 00:09:37.456 align:middle line:84%
and he finally told us about it,
told my sister and I about it,

00:09:37.456 --> 00:09:40.270 align:middle line:84%
and said, the government
was trying to cover it up,

00:09:40.270 --> 00:09:43.290 align:middle line:90%
that it really happened.

00:09:43.290 --> 00:09:45.230 align:middle line:84%
It's not something that
was just fictitious,

00:09:45.230 --> 00:09:46.230 align:middle line:90%
that it really happened.

00:09:46.230 --> 00:09:47.640 align:middle line:90%
It wasn't a weather balloon.

00:09:47.640 --> 00:09:48.995 align:middle line:90%
It was a crash site.

00:09:48.995 --> 00:09:51.400 align:middle line:84%
And he said he
went out and found,

00:09:51.400 --> 00:09:55.660 align:middle line:84%
that when he got there that
he observed the crash site,

00:09:55.660 --> 00:09:58.440 align:middle line:90%
a circular-type ship crash site.

00:09:58.440 --> 00:10:00.350 align:middle line:84%
And there was debris
strewn everywhere,

00:10:00.350 --> 00:10:04.420 align:middle line:84%
and that he had
found three bodies.

00:10:04.420 --> 00:10:07.370 align:middle line:84%
They had large hands on him,
and at least one of them

00:10:07.370 --> 00:10:10.680 align:middle line:84%
was still alive when they
brought him back to the base.

00:10:10.680 --> 00:10:14.750 align:middle line:84%
>> Donald Schmitt interviewed
more than 150 direct witnesses

00:10:14.750 --> 00:10:17.510 align:middle line:84%
and more than 600
indirect witnesses.

00:10:17.510 --> 00:10:20.150 align:middle line:10%
Many of them received the
testimony of their relatives

00:10:20.150 --> 00:10:22.610 align:middle line:10%
on their deathbed,
their last testament

00:10:22.610 --> 00:10:25.400 align:middle line:10%
of their phenomenal experience.

00:10:25.400 --> 00:10:30.050 align:middle line:84%
>> As he is giving his
last testimony to his wife,

00:10:30.050 --> 00:10:33.890 align:middle line:84%
and she describes this, and
she starts to become emotional.

00:10:33.890 --> 00:10:37.550 align:middle line:90%
And she says, he told me.

00:10:37.550 --> 00:10:43.040 align:middle line:84%
He said, I want you to know,
I've always been true to you.

00:10:43.040 --> 00:10:46.100 align:middle line:90%
I've always been faithful.

00:10:46.100 --> 00:10:48.920 align:middle line:84%
And then he tells
her about Roswell.

00:10:48.920 --> 00:10:52.100 align:middle line:84%
He equated that--
so in other words,

00:10:52.100 --> 00:10:56.990 align:middle line:84%
that level of emotional
attachment, his marriage,

00:10:56.990 --> 00:11:02.180 align:middle line:84%
his faithfulness to his wife was
on the same level of importance

00:11:02.180 --> 00:11:05.830 align:middle line:90%
as what happened in 1947.

00:11:05.830 --> 00:11:08.970 align:middle line:10%
>> A similar case is
voiced by Carlene Green.

00:11:08.970 --> 00:11:11.400 align:middle line:84%
Her father had the
highest security clearance

00:11:11.400 --> 00:11:13.440 align:middle line:90%
in the United States Air Force.

00:11:13.440 --> 00:11:16.620 align:middle line:84%
Two weeks before he
died, he broke silence

00:11:16.620 --> 00:11:20.810 align:middle line:84%
and told the secret he kept
for more than 26 years.

00:11:20.810 --> 00:11:23.670 align:middle line:10%
>> As they were getting ready
to put him on the gurney,

00:11:23.670 --> 00:11:26.670 align:middle line:10%
to load them up, he told me.

00:11:26.670 --> 00:11:29.950 align:middle line:84%
He said-- he always
called me his baby.

00:11:29.950 --> 00:11:33.090 align:middle line:10%
He said, baby, don't
ever let anyone tell you

00:11:33.090 --> 00:11:36.190 align:middle line:10%
that that crash didn't happen.

00:11:36.190 --> 00:11:38.100 align:middle line:90%
He said, it happened.

00:11:38.100 --> 00:11:39.690 align:middle line:90%
I was out there.

00:11:39.690 --> 00:11:41.550 align:middle line:90%
I saw the crash site.

00:11:41.550 --> 00:11:45.120 align:middle line:84%
I saw the spacecraft,
and the saw the grays.

00:11:45.120 --> 00:11:49.530 align:middle line:10%
I knelt beside him and I kissed
him, and I told him, Daddy,

00:11:49.530 --> 00:11:51.670 align:middle line:10%
I love you.

00:11:51.670 --> 00:11:54.090 align:middle line:10%
And I'll see you soon.

00:11:54.090 --> 00:11:59.310 align:middle line:84%
To see grown men cry,
to well up and cry over

00:11:59.310 --> 00:12:02.640 align:middle line:84%
something that, according
to the government,

00:12:02.640 --> 00:12:06.420 align:middle line:84%
was something so
conventional, so recognizable

00:12:06.420 --> 00:12:08.280 align:middle line:90%
as just being a weather balloon.

00:12:08.280 --> 00:12:12.870 align:middle line:84%
So I'm at the point
that I just can't

00:12:12.870 --> 00:12:19.230 align:middle line:84%
accept that all these people are
lying about this common thread

00:12:19.230 --> 00:12:22.460 align:middle line:90%
describing this same incident.

00:12:22.460 --> 00:12:28.630 align:middle line:84%
And my conclusion is
that I am 99% convinced.

00:12:28.630 --> 00:13:15.090 align:middle line:10%
>> [SPEAKING SPANISH]

00:13:15.090 --> 00:13:17.730 align:middle line:84%
>> Like this witness,
who as a young man worked

00:13:17.730 --> 00:13:20.530 align:middle line:84%
in the Strategic Air Command of
the armed forces of the United

00:13:20.530 --> 00:13:26.250 align:middle line:84%
States, and who had access
to Roswell secret files.

00:13:26.250 --> 00:13:28.410 align:middle line:84%
>> There were a few
pictures in there,

00:13:28.410 --> 00:13:34.300 align:middle line:84%
showed three dead aliens and
two standing, apparently alive.

00:13:34.300 --> 00:13:36.700 align:middle line:90%
I have no way of knowing that.

00:13:36.700 --> 00:13:39.180 align:middle line:84%
And I looked at
the pictures, and I

00:13:39.180 --> 00:13:41.130 align:middle line:84%
saw the pictures of
the craft as they

00:13:41.130 --> 00:13:47.650 align:middle line:84%
were taken after it had come
to rest on the neutral ground.

00:13:47.650 --> 00:13:49.020 align:middle line:90%
I'll be honest with you.

00:13:49.020 --> 00:13:54.510 align:middle line:84%
I regret deeply
not being able to--

00:13:54.510 --> 00:13:57.460 align:middle line:84%
not having read
the entire report.

00:13:57.460 --> 00:13:59.120 align:middle line:84%
There must have
been a lot in there.

00:13:59.120 --> 00:14:02.190 align:middle line:84%
Now, I am a firm believer
that the government

00:14:02.190 --> 00:14:04.720 align:middle line:90%
wants to keep quiet.

00:14:04.720 --> 00:14:07.410 align:middle line:90%
The saucer existed.

00:14:07.410 --> 00:14:08.760 align:middle line:90%
I saw the pictures of it.

00:14:08.760 --> 00:14:11.940 align:middle line:84%
The back-- well, I assume
the back right-hand corner

00:14:11.940 --> 00:14:13.630 align:middle line:90%
was gone.

00:14:13.630 --> 00:14:17.730 align:middle line:84%
There was no way to determine
if it was the front, the side,

00:14:17.730 --> 00:14:22.790 align:middle line:90%
or the rear of the spacecraft.

00:14:22.790 --> 00:14:26.310 align:middle line:84%
I quit calling it flying
saucer because, yes, it

00:14:26.310 --> 00:14:31.000 align:middle line:84%
looked like one, but it
was actual spacecraft.

00:14:31.000 --> 00:14:34.050 align:middle line:84%
>> In Roswell, New Mexico,
where the second ship came down

00:14:34.050 --> 00:14:38.970 align:middle line:84%
on July 3 of '47, witnesses such
as Frankie Rowe were threatened

00:14:38.970 --> 00:14:41.160 align:middle line:84%
if they talked
about what they saw.

00:14:41.160 --> 00:14:42.870 align:middle line:84%
She was told that
she and her parents

00:14:42.870 --> 00:14:45.420 align:middle line:84%
would be killed and
buried in the desert where

00:14:45.420 --> 00:14:47.970 align:middle line:84%
no one would find
them if she revealed

00:14:47.970 --> 00:14:50.340 align:middle line:90%
any details of the incident.

00:14:50.340 --> 00:14:52.900 align:middle line:84%
>> Probably in the wrong
place at the wrong time.

00:14:52.900 --> 00:14:55.200 align:middle line:84%
I was at the fire
station the day

00:14:55.200 --> 00:15:02.580 align:middle line:84%
the state policeman came by, and
he had a piece of the material.

00:15:02.580 --> 00:15:06.548 align:middle line:84%
And all of the firemen
handled it and played with it.

00:15:06.548 --> 00:15:08.340 align:middle line:84%
And when they were
through playing with it,

00:15:08.340 --> 00:15:12.880 align:middle line:84%
I got to handle it and
play with it for a while.

00:15:12.880 --> 00:15:14.980 align:middle line:90%
>> What did you do with it?

00:15:14.980 --> 00:15:18.960 align:middle line:84%
>> I would wad it up in my hand
and then drop it on the table.

00:15:18.960 --> 00:15:22.680 align:middle line:84%
And by the time it hit the
table, it was totally flat.

00:15:22.680 --> 00:15:27.840 align:middle line:84%
And it was so soft,
that it did not wrinkle.

00:15:27.840 --> 00:15:28.940 align:middle line:90%
It didn't make a noise.

00:15:28.940 --> 00:15:31.290 align:middle line:84%
There was no noise, and
you couldn't feel anything

00:15:31.290 --> 00:15:33.750 align:middle line:90%
when it was in your hand.

00:15:33.750 --> 00:15:35.220 align:middle line:90%
>> Did you crush it?

00:15:35.220 --> 00:15:38.310 align:middle line:84%
>> You could just
mash it up to nothing.

00:15:38.310 --> 00:15:40.610 align:middle line:90%
You couldn't feel it in there.

00:15:40.610 --> 00:15:45.180 align:middle line:84%
It was like holding air
or maybe quicksilver,

00:15:45.180 --> 00:15:47.430 align:middle line:84%
if you've ever played with
a thermometer when you were

00:15:47.430 --> 00:15:50.170 align:middle line:90%
a kid, which that's poisonous.

00:15:50.170 --> 00:15:54.560 align:middle line:84%
I understand now, but
we didn't know it then.

00:15:54.560 --> 00:15:58.140 align:middle line:84%
But it was like holding
nothing in your hand.

00:15:58.140 --> 00:16:00.390 align:middle line:90%
>> What happened to it?

00:16:00.390 --> 00:16:02.510 align:middle line:90%
>> To the piece of material?

00:16:02.510 --> 00:16:04.540 align:middle line:84%
The state policemen
took it back.

00:16:04.540 --> 00:16:06.870 align:middle line:84%
I don't know what
happened to it, finally,

00:16:06.870 --> 00:16:12.370 align:middle line:84%
because after everybody
talked about it,

00:16:12.370 --> 00:16:14.430 align:middle line:84%
I went back to Daddy's
room after a while.

00:16:14.430 --> 00:16:18.060 align:middle line:84%
I was there because I had
had to go to the doctor,

00:16:18.060 --> 00:16:22.650 align:middle line:84%
and I had been sitting out in
the kitchen area eating ice

00:16:22.650 --> 00:16:26.220 align:middle line:84%
chips after I came
back from the doctor's.

00:16:26.220 --> 00:16:30.840 align:middle line:84%
And otherwise, I would
not have been there.

00:16:30.840 --> 00:16:34.020 align:middle line:84%
And we knew about Daddy
going to the crash site

00:16:34.020 --> 00:16:36.850 align:middle line:84%
because a few days before
that, when he came home,

00:16:36.850 --> 00:16:38.700 align:middle line:90%
he told us about it.

00:16:38.700 --> 00:16:41.550 align:middle line:84%
So it wasn't a surprise when
the state policeman said

00:16:41.550 --> 00:16:46.050 align:middle line:84%
that he wanted to show Daddy
and his crew something he

00:16:46.050 --> 00:16:48.990 align:middle line:90%
had gotten at the crash site.

00:16:48.990 --> 00:16:51.870 align:middle line:84%
>> A few days later, a
serviceman who was a New York

00:16:51.870 --> 00:16:55.860 align:middle line:84%
state policeman showed up at
her house to threaten Frankie

00:16:55.860 --> 00:16:58.920 align:middle line:84%
and her family that if
she continued to talk,

00:16:58.920 --> 00:17:01.956 align:middle line:90%
she would be silenced forever.

00:17:01.956 --> 00:17:04.960 align:middle line:84%
>> He first tried to convince
me I didn't know anything,

00:17:04.960 --> 00:17:07.170 align:middle line:84%
I didn't see anything, and
I didn't hear anything.

00:17:07.170 --> 00:17:09.839 align:middle line:84%
And I kept insisting
I did because we

00:17:09.839 --> 00:17:12.359 align:middle line:90%
were taught you couldn't lie.

00:17:12.359 --> 00:17:20.230 align:middle line:84%
And when he insisted, you
don't know anything at all.

00:17:20.230 --> 00:17:24.000 align:middle line:84%
And he finally said,
if you don't understand

00:17:24.000 --> 00:17:26.430 align:middle line:84%
that you don't know
anything, I'll tell you

00:17:26.430 --> 00:17:27.520 align:middle line:90%
what will happen to you.

00:17:27.520 --> 00:17:30.210 align:middle line:84%
He said, you know,
we've still got--

00:17:30.210 --> 00:17:34.530 align:middle line:84%
we had to POW camps here
during World War II.

00:17:34.530 --> 00:17:37.050 align:middle line:84%
This is very shortly
after World War II is over

00:17:37.050 --> 00:17:39.340 align:middle line:90%
that this all happened.

00:17:39.340 --> 00:17:43.110 align:middle line:84%
And he said, you can be
taken from your parents.

00:17:43.110 --> 00:17:46.910 align:middle line:84%
We'll send them to
one of the POW camps.

00:17:46.910 --> 00:17:49.920 align:middle line:84%
We'll send all of the
kids to the other.

00:17:49.920 --> 00:17:52.980 align:middle line:84%
And one was south of
Roswell, called Orchard Park,

00:17:52.980 --> 00:17:55.930 align:middle line:84%
and the other one
was in Artesia.

00:17:55.930 --> 00:18:00.120 align:middle line:84%
And the Artesia camp was
not actually a POW camp.

00:18:00.120 --> 00:18:05.290 align:middle line:84%
It was the Japanese internment
camp for the Japanese citizens.

00:18:05.290 --> 00:18:10.080 align:middle line:84%
And he said, now, if
that doesn't convince you

00:18:10.080 --> 00:18:12.570 align:middle line:84%
that you can't
talk about this, we

00:18:12.570 --> 00:18:15.260 align:middle line:84%
can just take you out here
and kill you in the desert.

00:18:15.260 --> 00:18:17.430 align:middle line:90%
He said, it's a big, old desert.

00:18:17.430 --> 00:18:20.130 align:middle line:84%
Nobody will ever
find your bodies.

00:18:20.130 --> 00:18:21.780 align:middle line:84%
So we'll just bury
you out there.

00:18:21.780 --> 00:18:24.510 align:middle line:84%
Nobody will ever know
you were ever here.

00:18:24.510 --> 00:18:27.240 align:middle line:84%
So I promised I
wouldn't talk about it.

00:18:27.240 --> 00:18:30.540 align:middle line:90%


00:18:30.540 --> 00:18:34.020 align:middle line:90%
>> Were you impressed?

00:18:34.020 --> 00:18:40.930 align:middle line:84%
>> I was scared to death,
absolutely scared to death.

00:18:40.930 --> 00:18:46.630 align:middle line:84%
It was probably '91 before
I ever mentioned it again.

00:18:46.630 --> 00:18:51.430 align:middle line:84%
And at that point in time,
Kevin Randle and Don Schmitt

00:18:51.430 --> 00:18:56.100 align:middle line:84%
had just partnered up and
started researching it.

00:18:56.100 --> 00:19:00.420 align:middle line:84%
And Kevin convinced me that they
weren't going to hurt me now.

00:19:00.420 --> 00:19:03.630 align:middle line:84%
I was an adult. I
decided, because my mother

00:19:03.630 --> 00:19:06.990 align:middle line:84%
had just passed away
two years prior,

00:19:06.990 --> 00:19:10.320 align:middle line:90%
that she wouldn't be hurt.

00:19:10.320 --> 00:19:14.490 align:middle line:84%
So I went ahead and talked
about it for the first time.

00:19:14.490 --> 00:19:16.680 align:middle line:90%
He said that they had gone--

00:19:16.680 --> 00:19:20.760 align:middle line:84%
they thought they were
going to plane crash site.

00:19:20.760 --> 00:19:24.660 align:middle line:84%
And they did go out for things
like range fires and plane

00:19:24.660 --> 00:19:27.090 align:middle line:84%
crashes and things
like that, but he

00:19:27.090 --> 00:19:31.440 align:middle line:84%
said, when we got there we found
a flying saucer had crashed.

00:19:31.440 --> 00:19:35.100 align:middle line:84%
And there was one
that was still alive,

00:19:35.100 --> 00:19:40.170 align:middle line:84%
and he was walking
around, and two

00:19:40.170 --> 00:19:43.960 align:middle line:84%
that were in body bags
laying on the ground.

00:19:43.960 --> 00:19:48.030 align:middle line:84%
And he said they were already in
the bags before they got there.

00:19:48.030 --> 00:19:50.380 align:middle line:84%
And the little one that
was walking around,

00:19:50.380 --> 00:19:54.510 align:middle line:84%
talked to them in their
head, and that was

00:19:54.510 --> 00:19:56.790 align:middle line:90%
a shock to all of the firemen.

00:19:56.790 --> 00:19:59.610 align:middle line:84%
And he said, we talked
about it, and everybody

00:19:59.610 --> 00:20:03.750 align:middle line:84%
heard the same thing,
although there was no sound.

00:20:03.750 --> 00:20:06.030 align:middle line:84%
So it was mental
telepathy, but my dad

00:20:06.030 --> 00:20:10.020 align:middle line:84%
wouldn't have known
the terminology for it,

00:20:10.020 --> 00:20:13.600 align:middle line:84%
not in 1950 or
'47 when that was.

00:20:13.600 --> 00:20:15.040 align:middle line:90%
>> What did he tell you?

00:20:15.040 --> 00:20:16.012 align:middle line:90%
What did he tell him?

00:20:16.012 --> 00:20:18.650 align:middle line:90%


00:20:18.650 --> 00:20:23.670 align:middle line:84%
>> The little person told him,
we're not here to hurt you.

00:20:23.670 --> 00:20:25.845 align:middle line:90%
We don't mean anybody any harm.

00:20:25.845 --> 00:20:29.640 align:middle line:90%


00:20:29.640 --> 00:20:32.580 align:middle line:84%
There's nothing you
can do to help us.

00:20:32.580 --> 00:20:35.530 align:middle line:84%
Because they were talking
about, among themselves,

00:20:35.530 --> 00:20:36.420 align:middle line:90%
what can we do?

00:20:36.420 --> 00:20:37.770 align:middle line:90%
What should we do?

00:20:37.770 --> 00:20:39.450 align:middle line:84%
And the little person
told them, there's

00:20:39.450 --> 00:20:41.970 align:middle line:90%
nothing you can do to help us.

00:20:41.970 --> 00:20:45.420 align:middle line:84%
He said, there's
nothing you can do.

00:20:45.420 --> 00:20:49.240 align:middle line:84%
And that's pretty
close to the point

00:20:49.240 --> 00:20:54.120 align:middle line:84%
that the military got there
and told them to leave.

00:20:54.120 --> 00:20:56.522 align:middle line:90%
So they left.

00:20:56.522 --> 00:20:58.920 align:middle line:90%
>> But they saw everything.

00:20:58.920 --> 00:21:02.910 align:middle line:84%
>> They saw two that
were obviously dead,

00:21:02.910 --> 00:21:06.330 align:middle line:84%
and one that was alive
and walking and talking.

00:21:06.330 --> 00:21:08.580 align:middle line:84%
And he made a believer that
they would take care of us

00:21:08.580 --> 00:21:11.620 align:middle line:90%
if we talked about it.

00:21:11.620 --> 00:21:13.440 align:middle line:90%
>> And you think they would?

00:21:13.440 --> 00:21:15.900 align:middle line:90%
>> Absolutely.

00:21:15.900 --> 00:21:18.370 align:middle line:90%
Not a doubt in my mind.

00:21:18.370 --> 00:21:21.790 align:middle line:90%


00:21:21.790 --> 00:21:23.640 align:middle line:84%
I guess the man
really did impress me

00:21:23.640 --> 00:21:29.160 align:middle line:84%
because I did remember what
he looked like about 50 years

00:21:29.160 --> 00:21:30.630 align:middle line:90%
after it happened.

00:21:30.630 --> 00:21:34.110 align:middle line:90%
I could still see his face.

00:21:34.110 --> 00:21:38.490 align:middle line:84%
>> Frankie Rowe died
on July 28, 2017.

00:21:38.490 --> 00:21:40.380 align:middle line:84%
She was the last
witness who claimed

00:21:40.380 --> 00:21:44.370 align:middle line:84%
to have had one of the pieces of
the Roswell ship in her hands.

00:21:44.370 --> 00:21:48.390 align:middle line:84%
Frankie died without having
seen her dream come to fruition,

00:21:48.390 --> 00:21:50.490 align:middle line:84%
that the government
of the United States

00:21:50.490 --> 00:21:52.800 align:middle line:84%
would accept and
recognize that the crash

00:21:52.800 --> 00:21:55.230 align:middle line:84%
landing of an
extraterrestrial ship

00:21:55.230 --> 00:22:00.630 align:middle line:84%
actually happened in
Roswell, New Mexico, in 1947.

00:22:00.630 --> 00:22:02.510 align:middle line:84%
>> I think someday the
truth will come out,

00:22:02.510 --> 00:22:07.950 align:middle line:84%
but it won't be in my lifetime
because when Jimmy Carter was

00:22:07.950 --> 00:22:09.960 align:middle line:84%
running for president,
he promised to bring all

00:22:09.960 --> 00:22:11.220 align:middle line:90%
the details out.

00:22:11.220 --> 00:22:13.530 align:middle line:90%
But he couldn't.

00:22:13.530 --> 00:22:17.760 align:middle line:84%
And I still think they're
probably still watching this.

00:22:17.760 --> 00:22:22.235 align:middle line:84%
They did tell Daddy they'd been
watching us for a long time.

00:22:22.235 --> 00:22:23.610 align:middle line:84%
And he said, we
mean you no harm.

00:22:23.610 --> 00:22:28.690 align:middle line:90%


00:22:28.690 --> 00:22:33.430 align:middle line:84%
>> Frankie Rowe, who was a
12-year-old girl in 1947,

00:22:33.430 --> 00:22:39.310 align:middle line:84%
died in 2017 without having
seen her dream come true,

00:22:39.310 --> 00:22:42.940 align:middle line:84%
that the government of the
United States accept what

00:22:42.940 --> 00:22:46.540 align:middle line:84%
happened in Roswell as something
that actually happened,

00:22:46.540 --> 00:22:51.160 align:middle line:84%
that one or even two ships of
extraterrestrial origin crash

00:22:51.160 --> 00:22:52.430 align:middle line:90%
landed there.

00:22:52.430 --> 00:22:56.440 align:middle line:84%
There are fewer and fewer
witnesses that are still alive.

00:22:56.440 --> 00:23:00.190 align:middle line:84%
Unfortunately, time
has outrun them.

00:23:00.190 --> 00:23:03.340 align:middle line:84%
However, their testimonies
and their records

00:23:03.340 --> 00:23:05.950 align:middle line:84%
remain as a
testament to history.

00:23:05.950 --> 00:23:08.650 align:middle line:84%
I am Jaime Maussan,
and I will see you

00:23:08.650 --> 00:23:11.120 align:middle line:90%
