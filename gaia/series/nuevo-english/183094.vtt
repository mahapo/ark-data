is a distinctive feature on
the surface of the Red Planet,

00:01:00.370 --> 00:01:03.280 align:middle line:10%
located in the Cydonia region.

00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:05.379 align:middle line:84%
More specifically,
it is a figure

00:01:05.379 --> 00:01:08.140 align:middle line:90%
that resembles a human face.

00:01:08.140 --> 00:01:11.320 align:middle line:10%
It measures approximately
3 kilometers long

00:01:25.390 --> 00:01:29.920 align:middle line:84%
by the space probe Viking 1,
which was orbiting the planet.

00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:33.280 align:middle line:84%
News of this photo caught
the attention of the public.

00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:37.720 align:middle line:84%
And six days later, a press
report was delivered by NASA.

00:01:37.720 --> 00:01:40.870 align:middle line:84%
For more than a decade, many
consider this information

00:01:40.870 --> 00:01:43.300 align:middle line:90%
to be that of a human face.

00:01:43.300 --> 00:01:46.120 align:middle line:84%
And many people believe
it's a clear depiction

00:01:46.120 --> 00:01:49.810 align:middle line:84%
of an intelligent
alien presence on Mars.

00:01:49.810 --> 00:01:51.700 align:middle line:10%
It could have been
left as a message

00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:54.550 align:middle line:10%
by an ancient civilization
that at one time,

00:01:54.550 --> 00:01:56.920 align:middle line:10%
inhabited the Red Planet.

00:01:56.920 --> 00:02:00.010 align:middle line:10%
Two photographs taken
by Viking 1 and Viking 2

00:02:00.010 --> 00:02:02.980 align:middle line:10%
at different times
clearly show a face

00:02:02.980 --> 00:02:06.770 align:middle line:10%
with human characteristics.

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:09.840 align:middle line:84%
From the onset, NASA
assured the public

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:11.875 align:middle line:90%
it was just an optical illusion.

00:02:11.875 --> 00:02:14.380 align:middle line:90%


00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:18.610 align:middle line:84%
In 1998 and then in
2001, new photographs

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:22.540 align:middle line:84%
were released that were taken
by the Mars Global Surveyor.

00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:25.760 align:middle line:84%
And in 2002, another
photo was released

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:28.720 align:middle line:84%
that was shot by the
Mars Odyssey Orbiter.

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:30.320 align:middle line:10%
The light was different.

00:02:30.320 --> 00:02:32.080 align:middle line:10%
And the perspective
of the photographs

00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:34.960 align:middle line:10%
left diverse opinions
and impressions.

00:02:34.960 --> 00:02:37.150 align:middle line:10%
NASA scientists
ensured the public

00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:40.270 align:middle line:10%
that the structure was a
natural rock formation.

00:02:40.270 --> 00:02:42.880 align:middle line:84%
And that there was no reason
to believe that it could have

00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:46.240 align:middle line:90%
been built by any alien beings.

00:02:46.240 --> 00:02:48.910 align:middle line:84%
In addition to the
face seen from space,

00:02:48.910 --> 00:02:51.010 align:middle line:84%
there were some
pyramidal shapes that

00:02:51.010 --> 00:02:53.410 align:middle line:84%
were found on Mars
that confirmed,

00:02:53.410 --> 00:02:57.970 align:middle line:84%
for some, that an intelligent
civilization had existed there.

00:02:57.970 --> 00:03:01.420 align:middle line:84%
At this point in history,
these pyramid-shaped objects

00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:03.580 align:middle line:90%
remain unexplained.

00:03:03.580 --> 00:03:07.180 align:middle line:84%
However, evidence of suspected
intelligent presence on Mars

00:03:07.180 --> 00:03:08.470 align:middle line:90%
has continued.

00:03:08.470 --> 00:03:11.440 align:middle line:84%
And many believe that the
pyramids were built by someone

00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:13.330 align:middle line:90%
from another planet.

00:03:13.330 --> 00:03:17.560 align:middle line:84%
On May 19, 2000, the Mars
Global Surveyor probe

00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:20.945 align:middle line:84%
took a series of photographs
in the Acidalia region

00:03:20.945 --> 00:03:21.745 align:middle line:90%
of the Red Planet.

00:03:21.745 --> 00:03:24.800 align:middle line:90%


00:03:24.800 --> 00:03:27.470 align:middle line:84%
In these images,
tunnels can be seen

00:03:27.470 --> 00:03:30.560 align:middle line:84%
that appear to be
semi-transparent, and run

00:03:30.560 --> 00:03:31.535 align:middle line:90%
for many miles.

00:03:31.535 --> 00:03:44.030 align:middle line:90%


00:03:44.030 --> 00:03:47.150 align:middle line:84%
These extraordinary
images suggest

00:03:47.150 --> 00:03:49.940 align:middle line:84%
that the tunnels might have
been used for a communication

00:03:49.940 --> 00:03:50.740 align:middle line:90%
system.

00:03:50.740 --> 00:03:53.570 align:middle line:90%


00:03:53.570 --> 00:03:59.960 align:middle line:84%
Or the complex array of tunnels
were for inner planet travel.

00:03:59.960 --> 00:04:03.050 align:middle line:84%
We can see from different
angles in this enhanced digital

00:04:03.050 --> 00:04:05.000 align:middle line:84%
illustration that
these tunnels are

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:07.610 align:middle line:90%
quite large in size and height.

00:04:07.610 --> 00:04:11.940 align:middle line:90%


00:04:11.940 --> 00:04:14.670 align:middle line:84%
An extraordinary

00:04:14.670 --> 00:04:16.949 align:middle line:84%
Mars that we call
the Red Planet.

>> Using Google
Mars in June 2011,

00:05:08.950 --> 00:05:13.480 align:middle line:84%
researcher David Martines found
a structure that he called

00:05:13.480 --> 00:05:19.780 align:middle line:84%
the Bio Alpha Station, measuring
230 meters long and 45 meters

00:05:19.780 --> 00:05:20.680 align:middle line:90%
wide.

00:05:20.680 --> 00:05:23.360 align:middle line:84%
It is located near
the north pole.

00:05:25.900 --> 00:05:30.640 align:middle line:10%
>> In June 2011, David Martines
was viewing the Mars Globe

00:05:30.640 --> 00:05:33.640 align:middle line:10%
program on the internet,
which is a detailed map

00:05:33.640 --> 00:05:37.600 align:middle line:10%
of the surface of Mars, when
he stumbled across a surprising

00:05:37.600 --> 00:05:39.670 align:middle line:10%
structure.

00:05:39.670 --> 00:05:42.940 align:middle line:84%
The structure contrasts
with the Martian soil.

00:05:42.940 --> 00:05:44.140 align:middle line:90%
It wasn't ice.

00:05:44.140 --> 00:05:45.910 align:middle line:90%
It wasn't a Martian rock.

00:05:45.910 --> 00:05:49.720 align:middle line:84%
And in this region of Mars,
there aren't any mountains.

00:05:49.720 --> 00:05:53.740 align:middle line:84%
It looks like a building with
several cylindrical objects

00:05:53.740 --> 00:05:56.650 align:middle line:90%
that are connected.

00:05:56.650 --> 00:05:58.660 align:middle line:10%
According to the
scale of the map,

00:05:58.660 --> 00:06:03.430 align:middle line:10%
it measured about 700 feet
long and 150 feet wide,

00:06:03.430 --> 00:06:08.410 align:middle line:10%
or about 213 meters
long and 45 meters wide.

00:06:08.410 --> 00:06:10.720 align:middle line:90%
It is white or bright silver.

00:06:10.720 --> 00:06:13.390 align:middle line:84%
And very different from
the surrounding soil.

00:06:13.390 --> 00:06:15.730 align:middle line:84%
Because of its
symmetry, it definitely

00:06:15.730 --> 00:06:19.460 align:middle line:84%
looks like some kind
of base or housing.

00:06:19.460 --> 00:06:23.500 align:middle line:84%
>> This is a video of something
that I discovered on Google

00:06:23.500 --> 00:06:25.660 align:middle line:90%
Mars, quite by accident.

00:06:28.570 --> 00:06:31.750 align:middle line:90%
I call it Bio Station Alpha.

00:06:31.750 --> 00:06:37.790 align:middle line:84%
It's very unusual in
that it's quite large.

00:06:37.790 --> 00:06:43.580 align:middle line:84%
It's over 700 feet
long, 150 feet wide.

00:06:43.580 --> 00:06:46.630 align:middle line:84%
It looks like it's a
cylinder or made up

00:06:46.630 --> 00:06:48.310 align:middle line:90%
of cylinders-- cylinder shapes.

00:06:51.520 --> 00:06:53.860 align:middle line:84%
And news of this
discovery was reported

00:06:53.860 --> 00:06:57.250 align:middle line:84%
on the internet and television
in the United States.

00:06:57.250 --> 00:07:00.910 align:middle line:84%
But NASA has not yet
explained what it is.

00:07:00.910 --> 00:07:03.160 align:middle line:84%
Spokesman Don Brown
said there is not

00:07:03.160 --> 00:07:07.360 align:middle line:84%
enough evidence to consider
it an artificial structure.

00:07:07.360 --> 00:07:10.390 align:middle line:84%
It's possible that they don't
know the origin of this object

00:07:10.390 --> 00:07:11.530 align:middle line:90%
or building.

00:07:11.530 --> 00:07:14.350 align:middle line:84%
We were able to confirm
from the Mars Globe

00:07:14.350 --> 00:07:17.140 align:middle line:84%
that the structure
really does exist.

00:07:17.140 --> 00:07:20.290 align:middle line:84%
We searched the maps and
regions near the Martian pole

00:07:20.290 --> 00:07:23.920 align:middle line:84%
for other forms like this
or even similar to it,

00:07:23.920 --> 00:07:25.390 align:middle line:90%
and found nothing.

00:07:25.390 --> 00:07:28.840 align:middle line:84%
This discovery is an additional
unexplained phenomenon

00:07:28.840 --> 00:07:30.490 align:middle line:90%
on the Red Planet.

00:07:30.490 --> 00:07:32.890 align:middle line:90%
David simply states--

00:07:32.890 --> 00:07:37.220 align:middle line:90%
>> Clearly, it's not a rock.

00:07:37.220 --> 00:07:39.980 align:middle line:90%
It's not a mountain.

00:07:39.980 --> 00:07:40.790 align:middle line:90%
So there it is.

[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:07:42.900 --> 00:07:43.700 align:middle line:90%


00:07:43.700 --> 00:07:48.950 align:middle line:84%
>> Indeed, there is what appears
to be an artificial structure.

00:07:48.950 --> 00:07:50.840 align:middle line:84%
Evidence that allows
us to consider

00:07:50.840 --> 00:07:56.900 align:middle line:84%
the possibility that life
exists or once existed on Mars.

00:07:56.900 --> 00:08:00.950 align:middle line:84%
There could be a civilization
that survived a great storm.

00:08:00.950 --> 00:08:05.030 align:middle line:84%
And what was left is the
building we just observed.

00:08:05.030 --> 00:08:08.030 align:middle line:10%
The Mars Science
Lab Curiosity Rover

00:08:08.030 --> 00:08:11.210 align:middle line:10%
sent very clear images back
to Earth from the moment

00:08:11.210 --> 00:08:14.360 align:middle line:10%
it started to survey
the surface of Mars.

00:08:14.360 --> 00:08:17.420 align:middle line:10%
That was on August 9, 2012.

00:08:17.420 --> 00:08:20.330 align:middle line:10%
As it captured its first
images, in the distance,

00:08:20.330 --> 00:08:25.910 align:middle line:10%
you can make out what appears
to be an extremely large dome.

00:08:25.910 --> 00:08:28.460 align:middle line:84%
When making the approach,
it is very clear

00:08:28.460 --> 00:08:30.020 align:middle line:84%
that it's an object
that does not

00:08:30.020 --> 00:08:32.820 align:middle line:84%
seem to be part of
the Martian landscape,

00:08:32.820 --> 00:08:37.010 align:middle line:84%
rather something
that was built there.

00:08:37.010 --> 00:08:41.600 align:middle line:84%
One cannot help but wonder,
why the Curiosity Rover did not

00:08:41.600 --> 00:08:44.720 align:middle line:84%
head to that place
immediately after seeing it.

00:08:44.720 --> 00:08:48.470 align:middle line:10%
Or why it has not
returned to explore it.

00:08:48.470 --> 00:08:52.490 align:middle line:10%
The Curiosity Rover captured
another enigmatic image

00:08:52.490 --> 00:08:54.770 align:middle line:10%
when leaving the Gale Crater.

00:08:54.770 --> 00:08:59.450 align:middle line:84%
Here, we see what seems to be
a semi-buried pyramid, of which

00:08:59.450 --> 00:09:01.340 align:middle line:90%
we can only see its tip.

00:09:01.340 --> 00:09:04.490 align:middle line:84%
However, it could be
a marker of some kind.

00:09:04.490 --> 00:09:07.370 align:middle line:84%
Here on Earth, in
almost every culture,

00:09:07.370 --> 00:09:10.940 align:middle line:84%
we have found pyramidal
forms such as this.

00:09:10.940 --> 00:09:13.250 align:middle line:84%
Often, they were used
to mark specific points

00:09:13.250 --> 00:09:14.730 align:middle line:90%
on the landscape.

00:09:14.730 --> 00:09:16.940 align:middle line:84%
What is very clear
is that this is

00:09:16.940 --> 00:09:20.270 align:middle line:84%
a structure that was
artificially constructed, not

00:09:20.270 --> 00:09:22.820 align:middle line:90%
naturally formed.

00:09:22.820 --> 00:09:27.500 align:middle line:10%
The Opportunity Rover landed
on Mars in January of 2004,

00:09:27.500 --> 00:09:31.430 align:middle line:10%
and captured the image of what
appears to be two structures--

00:09:31.430 --> 00:09:36.050 align:middle line:10%
a larger dome and a smaller dome
sitting isolated in the dirt.

00:09:36.050 --> 00:09:38.990 align:middle line:10%
Later, these unique
structures were observed again

00:09:38.990 --> 00:09:43.640 align:middle line:10%

Rover has been able to survive
almost 14 years in such adverse

00:10:03.030 --> 00:10:05.490 align:middle line:90%
conditions and extreme weather.

00:10:05.490 --> 00:10:08.130 align:middle line:84%

a cleaning event.

What or who is
cleaning the rovers?

00:10:11.040 --> 00:10:14.370 align:middle line:84%
There are two pieces of
evidence that could provide us

00:10:14.370 --> 00:10:15.180 align:middle line:90%
with the answer.

to be an ancient city.

00:10:22.990 --> 00:10:26.290 align:middle line:10%
These images were captured
by the Mars Express probe

00:10:26.290 --> 00:10:31.310 align:middle line:10%
in August of 2004, and
speak for themselves.

00:10:31.310 --> 00:10:34.540 align:middle line:84%
It is clear that these are the
remains of destroyed buildings

00:10:34.540 --> 00:10:38.170 align:middle line:84%
of what might have been a
large complex, with terraces

00:10:38.170 --> 00:10:42.130 align:middle line:84%
and lines of vertical
and horizontal structure.

00:10:42.130 --> 00:10:45.640 align:middle line:84%
It is for you to decide
its authenticity.

00:10:45.640 --> 00:10:50.200 align:middle line:84%
Are these abandoned remains of
an ancient city eroded by time?

00:10:50.200 --> 00:10:53.350 align:middle line:10%
Are they ghost remnants
that speak of other eras

00:10:53.350 --> 00:10:56.290 align:middle line:10%
on our neighboring planet, Mars?

00:10:56.290 --> 00:10:58.930 align:middle line:84%
Thanks to the work of
passionate scientists,

00:10:58.930 --> 00:11:01.930 align:middle line:84%
we have added additional
contrast to these images

00:11:01.930 --> 00:11:07.000 align:middle line:84%
to allow us to observe
the details more clearly.

00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:10.720 align:middle line:10%
Could these be the remains of
an unknown galactic city that

00:11:10.720 --> 00:11:13.270 align:middle line:10%
succumbed to a nuclear war?

00:11:13.270 --> 00:11:17.330 align:middle line:84%
Even though these images were
taken more than 13 years ago,

00:11:17.330 --> 00:11:21.670 align:middle line:84%
the European Space Agency
has not commented on them.

00:11:21.670 --> 00:11:24.490 align:middle line:84%
These images are
very compelling,

00:11:24.490 --> 00:11:26.470 align:middle line:84%
real evidence of
structures of what

00:11:26.470 --> 00:11:30.310 align:middle line:84%
could have been an
active city on Mars.

00:11:30.310 --> 00:11:32.680 align:middle line:84%
Another of the great
mysteries of Mars

00:11:32.680 --> 00:11:36.730 align:middle line:84%
were unveiled by the
Opportunity and Spirit rovers.

00:11:36.730 --> 00:11:38.980 align:middle line:84%
Both rovers were
programmed for a mission

00:11:38.980 --> 00:11:43.480 align:middle line:84%
to explore, take soil
and rock samples, videos,

00:11:43.480 --> 00:11:46.600 align:middle line:90%
and photographs.

00:11:46.600 --> 00:11:50.290 align:middle line:84%
The mission on the Red Planet
was expected to last three

00:11:50.290 --> 00:11:52.600 align:middle line:90%
to six months.

00:11:52.600 --> 00:11:56.440 align:middle line:84%
Often, the solar panels would
get covered with Martian dust.

00:11:56.440 --> 00:12:00.040 align:middle line:84%
Not a surprise, considering
the landscape and weather.

00:12:00.040 --> 00:12:03.200 align:middle line:84%
So with the panels enveloped
in a layer of dust,

00:12:03.200 --> 00:12:05.680 align:middle line:84%
the electrical systems
would stop working,

00:12:05.680 --> 00:12:07.780 align:middle line:90%
and shut down the rover.

00:12:07.780 --> 00:12:11.380 align:middle line:84%
But mysteriously, the two
rover panels would somehow

00:12:11.380 --> 00:12:13.420 align:middle line:84%
get cleaned, and
their solar systems

00:12:13.420 --> 00:12:15.490 align:middle line:90%
would begin working again.

00:12:15.490 --> 00:12:18.430 align:middle line:84%
Even after 14 years,
the NASA engineers

00:12:18.430 --> 00:12:21.970 align:middle line:84%
were astonished that both
rovers continued to function.

00:12:21.970 --> 00:12:24.700 align:middle line:84%
Someone is cleaning
the solar panels.

00:12:24.700 --> 00:12:27.130 align:middle line:10%
The Opportunity rover
continues to work today,

00:12:27.130 --> 00:12:29.410 align:middle line:10%
years after arriving on Mars.

00:12:29.410 --> 00:12:32.080 align:middle line:10%
These events have been
called cleaning events,

00:12:32.080 --> 00:12:35.540 align:middle line:10%
and can even be
found on Wikipedia.

00:12:35.540 --> 00:12:39.550 align:middle line:84%
So far, the Opportunity rover
has been cleaned five times.

00:12:39.550 --> 00:12:42.520 align:middle line:84%
While the Spirit rover, after
being cleaned repeatedly,

00:12:42.520 --> 00:12:47.560 align:middle line:84%
got stuck in 2020, and
became immobilized.

00:12:47.560 --> 00:12:51.310 align:middle line:84%
Curiously, since then, its
panels have not been cleaned.

00:12:51.310 --> 00:12:54.850 align:middle line:84%
And it remains incommunicado
with the Earth.

00:12:54.850 --> 00:12:58.720 align:middle line:84%
Recently, the Opportunity rover
was cleaned for the last time,

00:12:58.720 --> 00:13:00.880 align:middle line:84%
and at that moment,
its solar panels

00:13:00.880 --> 00:13:05.710 align:middle line:84%
were as clean as when it began
its mission on Mars years ago.

00:13:05.710 --> 00:13:09.520 align:middle line:84%
We can clearly see that the
panels are covered with dust.

00:13:09.520 --> 00:13:12.220 align:middle line:84%
And then suddenly, from
one day to the next,

00:13:12.220 --> 00:13:15.850 align:middle line:90%
they appear totally clean.

00:13:15.850 --> 00:13:18.070 align:middle line:84%
Here are some
photographic examples

00:13:18.070 --> 00:13:21.670 align:middle line:84%

cleaning events on the rovers

00:13:21.670 --> 00:13:22.840 align:middle line:90%
that we have talked about.

Unfortunately, her face is

With a computer program, we have
created the image of this woman

00:18:56.280 --> 00:19:02.040 align:middle line:84%
as a 3D animation, respecting
even the smallest detail.

00:19:02.040 --> 00:19:04.930 align:middle line:90%
Watch and examine it carefully.

00:19:04.930 --> 00:19:07.530 align:middle line:90%
It has to be a human form.

00:19:07.530 --> 00:19:09.690 align:middle line:90%
Clearly, that of a woman.

00:19:09.690 --> 00:19:14.610 align:middle line:90%


00:19:14.610 --> 00:19:17.970 align:middle line:84%
However, it is difficult to
believe that any person could

00:19:17.970 --> 00:19:21.210 align:middle line:84%
survive in such extreme
conditions on such

00:19:21.210 --> 00:19:23.070 align:middle line:90%
a hostile planet.

00:19:23.070 --> 00:19:26.310 align:middle line:84%
There is practically no
oxygen in the Mars atmosphere.

00:19:26.310 --> 00:19:28.680 align:middle line:90%
And no perceivable water.

00:19:28.680 --> 00:19:30.780 align:middle line:84%
And with extreme
temperatures ranging

00:19:30.780 --> 00:19:33.720 align:middle line:84%
between 20 and 80
degrees below zero

00:19:33.720 --> 00:19:36.090 align:middle line:84%
in this region where
the image was taken,

00:19:36.090 --> 00:19:39.960 align:middle line:84%
survival would be
difficult. This photograph

00:19:39.960 --> 00:19:42.630 align:middle line:84%
was captured by
the Spirit rover,

00:19:42.630 --> 00:19:44.545 align:middle line:90%
and is not an optical illusion.

00:19:44.545 --> 00:19:48.960 align:middle line:90%


00:19:48.960 --> 00:19:52.980 align:middle line:10%
Almost two years earlier,
in January of 2006,

00:19:52.980 --> 00:19:56.670 align:middle line:10%
the Spirit rover obtained
another very strange image

00:19:56.670 --> 00:19:58.560 align:middle line:10%
in the Gusev crater.

00:19:58.560 --> 00:20:01.770 align:middle line:84%
What we see here seems
to be an object made

00:20:01.770 --> 00:20:03.840 align:middle line:84%
of stone that would
have been placed

00:20:03.840 --> 00:20:06.690 align:middle line:90%
one object next to the other.

00:20:06.690 --> 00:20:10.620 align:middle line:84%
This image also has no
conventional explanation,

00:20:10.620 --> 00:20:14.610 align:middle line:84%
yet it is clear that this
object was not formed naturally.

00:20:14.610 --> 00:20:18.594 align:middle line:90%


00:20:18.594 --> 00:20:20.910 align:middle line:90%
Who or what made it?

00:20:20.910 --> 00:20:25.793 align:middle line:90%


00:20:25.793 --> 00:20:28.765 align:middle line:90%
And why does this room exist?

00:20:28.765 --> 00:20:35.980 align:middle line:90%


00:20:35.980 --> 00:20:39.010 align:middle line:84%
There are many unanswered
questions on Mars.

00:20:39.010 --> 00:20:41.170 align:middle line:84%
And surely, the
most important query

00:20:41.170 --> 00:20:45.880 align:middle line:84%
would be, why weren't these two
objects investigated further?

00:20:45.880 --> 00:20:47.680 align:middle line:84%
Why didn't the
Spirit rover, which

00:20:47.680 --> 00:20:52.360 align:middle line:84%
wasn't far from this place,
return to take new images?

00:20:52.360 --> 00:20:54.370 align:middle line:84%
The possibility of
having confirmed

00:20:54.370 --> 00:20:57.700 align:middle line:84%
an intelligent presence
on Mars would undoubtedly

00:20:57.700 --> 00:21:01.430 align:middle line:84%
justify any effort by the
scientists who were controlling

00:21:01.430 --> 00:21:02.230 align:middle line:90%
the Spirit rover.

00:21:02.230 --> 00:21:06.790 align:middle line:90%


00:21:06.790 --> 00:21:09.430 align:middle line:84%
Could a human being
survive on Mars?

00:21:09.430 --> 00:21:11.660 align:middle line:84%
According to the
information available,

00:21:11.660 --> 00:21:14.440 align:middle line:84%
it would be difficult since
the availability of oxygen

00:21:14.440 --> 00:21:16.750 align:middle line:90%
is practically non-existent.

00:21:16.750 --> 00:21:19.250 align:middle line:84%
However, we already know that
there is some water present

00:21:19.250 --> 00:21:20.050 align:middle line:90%
there.

00:21:20.050 --> 00:21:24.050 align:middle line:84%
And we know that the soil
is fertile for plant growth.

00:21:24.050 --> 00:21:26.350 align:middle line:84%
We also know that
temperatures during the day

00:21:26.350 --> 00:21:28.660 align:middle line:90%
are similar to those on Earth.

00:21:28.660 --> 00:21:32.950 align:middle line:84%
But no one really knows if
we could survive underground.

00:21:32.950 --> 00:21:35.170 align:middle line:84%
We'll only be able to
answer those questions when

00:21:35.170 --> 00:21:38.470 align:middle line:84%
human beings land on Mars,
and can explore its surface

00:21:38.470 --> 00:21:40.390 align:middle line:90%
in person.

00:21:40.390 --> 00:21:44.410 align:middle line:84%
In other released images,
we can view objects or ships

00:21:44.410 --> 00:21:46.780 align:middle line:90%
flying over the surface of Mars.

00:21:46.780 --> 00:21:49.600 align:middle line:84%
Objects that have no
predictable explanation.

00:21:49.600 --> 00:21:52.440 align:middle line:90%


00:21:52.440 --> 00:21:55.200 align:middle line:10%
These photographs of
a dish-shaped object

00:21:55.200 --> 00:22:01.950 align:middle line:10%
were captured in July of 2014.

00:22:01.950 --> 00:22:05.790 align:middle line:84%
In another photo, here
cylindrical objects or ships,

00:22:05.790 --> 00:22:10.080 align:middle line:84%
such as in the sequence, were
taken by the Curiosity rover

00:22:10.080 --> 00:22:16.768 align:middle line:90%
on April 28, 2014.

episode of "Nuevo",

00:22:23.040 --> 00:22:27.690 align:middle line:84%
we will present irrefutable
proof that an atomic explosion

00:22:27.690 --> 00:22:31.830 align:middle line:84%
occurred on the Red Planet,
Mars, on October 19.

00:22:31.830 --> 00:22:33.600 align:middle line:90%
2015.

00:22:33.600 --> 00:22:36.570 align:middle line:84%
This explosion was
captured by cameras

00:22:36.570 --> 00:22:39.180 align:middle line:90%
from space, and from there.

00:22:39.180 --> 00:22:41.550 align:middle line:84%
I'm Jaime Maussan,

00:22:41.550 --> 00:22:43.110 align:middle line:90%
