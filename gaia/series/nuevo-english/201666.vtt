>> This is Nuevo.

00:00:02.770 --> 00:00:05.170 align:middle line:84%
We continue with
the investigation

00:00:05.170 --> 00:00:09.040 align:middle line:84%
of the extraordinary events
that occurred over the Pentagon

00:00:09.040 --> 00:00:15.850 align:middle line:84%
in the capital of the United
States on December 19, 2018.

with Jaime Maussan.

00:00:39.060 --> 00:00:43.110 align:middle line:10%
>> The Nuevo team was able to
find two of the witnesses who

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:47.760 align:middle line:10%
were driving in a car in the
vicinity of the Pentagon,

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:51.810 align:middle line:10%
and were able to record two
videos with the images closest

00:00:51.810 --> 00:00:55.018 align:middle line:10%
to the United States
Intelligence Center.

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:04.950 align:middle line:84%
>> Richard and Nick had attended
a party with old friends from

00:01:04.950 --> 00:01:06.600 align:middle line:90%
the university.

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:09.630 align:middle line:84%
Around 4:00 in the morning,
they were driving in a taxi

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:11.460 align:middle line:84%
when they observed
a large object

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:14.100 align:middle line:90%
floating above the Pentagon.

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:17.700 align:middle line:84%
They thought it was
a joke or a hologram.

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:20.760 align:middle line:84%
However, they decided to
go around the high security

00:01:20.760 --> 00:01:23.730 align:middle line:84%
facilities several
times to take a closer

00:01:23.730 --> 00:01:27.120 align:middle line:90%
look at what was in the sky.

00:01:27.120 --> 00:01:31.080 align:middle line:84%
According to the images, they
were moving in a fast track.

00:01:31.080 --> 00:01:33.270 align:middle line:84%
These are the
extraordinary images

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:36.420 align:middle line:90%
captured from a moving car.

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:39.480 align:middle line:84%
It's surprising the similarity
with the recording made

00:01:39.480 --> 00:01:43.770 align:middle line:84%
nine years before in
Russia above the Kremlin,

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:46.290 align:middle line:84%
several friends who were
walking late at night

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:49.410 align:middle line:84%
in front of very
sensitive places.

00:01:49.410 --> 00:01:52.560 align:middle line:84%
In both cases, they
had attended a party

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:57.730 align:middle line:84%
and had a higher resolution
camera than cell phones.

00:01:57.730 --> 00:02:01.200 align:middle line:84%
This is a direct copy
of the original video.

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:03.780 align:middle line:84%
Richard and Nick recorded
two different videos.

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:06.840 align:middle line:90%


00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:09.840 align:middle line:84%
These are the images
from the first video.

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:13.635 align:middle line:84%
These images have never been
presented in any other media.

00:02:13.635 --> 00:02:29.389 align:middle line:90%


00:02:29.389 --> 00:02:30.387 align:middle line:90%
>> Look up.

00:02:30.387 --> 00:02:31.385 align:middle line:90%
Look up, man.

00:02:31.385 --> 00:02:35.900 align:middle line:90%


00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:38.830 align:middle line:90%
>> It's bigger than a plane.

00:02:38.830 --> 00:02:41.520 align:middle line:90%
I mean, this is real big.

00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:43.520 align:middle line:84%
>> Bro, I think it's
a weather balloon.

00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:44.660 align:middle line:90%
I tell you.

00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:46.320 align:middle line:90%
>> No, this is not a balloon.

00:02:46.320 --> 00:02:47.310 align:middle line:90%
This is alien shit.

00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:50.820 align:middle line:90%


00:02:50.820 --> 00:02:54.510 align:middle line:84%
>> The second video was
recorded a few minutes later,

00:02:54.510 --> 00:02:56.400 align:middle line:90%
very close to the Pentagon.

00:02:56.400 --> 00:02:59.460 align:middle line:84%
It is necessary to clarify
that the witnesses could not

00:02:59.460 --> 00:03:02.560 align:middle line:84%
specify the exact
location of the recording,

00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:05.910 align:middle line:84%
so it was necessary to use
different internet applications

00:03:05.910 --> 00:03:08.460 align:middle line:84%
to locate the exact
location of the recording.

00:03:08.460 --> 00:03:11.880 align:middle line:90%


00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:13.740 align:middle line:84%
The recording begins
the moment they

00:03:13.740 --> 00:03:17.880 align:middle line:84%
were traveling under Interstate
395 and Henry G. Shirley

00:03:17.880 --> 00:03:21.260 align:middle line:90%
Memorial Highway.

00:03:21.260 --> 00:03:24.680 align:middle line:84%
Obviously, they saw the
large object on the Pentagon

00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:30.140 align:middle line:84%
and activated their camera when
they were under the overpass.

00:03:30.140 --> 00:03:33.090 align:middle line:84%
When they were in South
Hayes Street to their right,

00:03:33.090 --> 00:03:34.550 align:middle line:84%
they look at the
object that looked

00:03:34.550 --> 00:03:38.760 align:middle line:84%
like a pyramid in the
sky above the Pentagon,

00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:40.640 align:middle line:90%
and they were surprised.

00:03:40.640 --> 00:03:42.530 align:middle line:84%
Nick comments that
it is a bigger

00:03:42.530 --> 00:03:44.630 align:middle line:90%
object than an airplane--

00:03:44.630 --> 00:03:46.390 align:middle line:90%
really big.

00:03:46.390 --> 00:03:51.020 align:middle line:84%
While Richard is more skeptical
that it is a weather balloon.

00:03:51.020 --> 00:03:53.390 align:middle line:84%
Nick replies that
it is not a balloon,

00:03:53.390 --> 00:03:55.670 align:middle line:90%
and that he is sure of it.

00:03:55.670 --> 00:03:58.109 align:middle line:90%
>> Right, right!

00:03:58.109 --> 00:04:00.524 align:middle line:90%
Oh, oh, man.

00:04:00.524 --> 00:04:01.490 align:middle line:90%
What is this?

00:04:01.490 --> 00:04:07.780 align:middle line:90%


00:04:07.780 --> 00:04:12.010 align:middle line:84%
>> This is a fucking
alien invasion.

00:04:12.010 --> 00:04:13.498 align:middle line:90%
>> Do you see it?

00:04:13.498 --> 00:04:14.986 align:middle line:90%
Where is it?

00:04:14.986 --> 00:04:16.637 align:middle line:90%
Give me the camera.

00:04:16.637 --> 00:04:20.750 align:middle line:90%


00:04:20.750 --> 00:04:24.140 align:middle line:84%
>> In the second video these
friends recorded that night,

00:04:24.140 --> 00:04:27.680 align:middle line:84%
we can see that they are now
circulating on Columbia Pike

00:04:27.680 --> 00:04:31.010 align:middle line:84%
until they take the exit to
Washington South Boulevard

00:04:31.010 --> 00:04:35.540 align:middle line:84%
and avoid reaching the
Pentagon's restricted area.

00:04:35.540 --> 00:04:39.500 align:middle line:84%
There, they comment if it
is really an alien ship,

00:04:39.500 --> 00:04:44.150 align:middle line:84%
while the camera passes from
Nick's hands to Richard's.

00:04:44.150 --> 00:04:48.030 align:middle line:84%
They turn right and continue
on the same boulevard.

00:04:48.030 --> 00:04:49.850 align:middle line:84%
They seem to be
even more surprised

00:04:49.850 --> 00:04:54.636 align:middle line:84%
and wondering again what
that object really was.

00:04:54.636 --> 00:04:55.582 align:middle line:90%
>> I got you, baby.

00:04:55.582 --> 00:04:58.420 align:middle line:90%


00:04:58.420 --> 00:05:00.820 align:middle line:90%
I see it.

00:05:00.820 --> 00:05:04.180 align:middle line:84%
>> They then order the driver
to turn right, and again,

00:05:04.180 --> 00:05:07.900 align:middle line:84%
the camera returns
to Nick's hands,

00:05:07.900 --> 00:05:10.415 align:middle line:84%
and they request
that he slow down.

00:05:10.415 --> 00:05:12.760 align:middle line:90%
>> Can it be like a ancient god?

00:05:12.760 --> 00:05:15.060 align:middle line:90%
You know.

00:05:15.060 --> 00:05:17.950 align:middle line:84%
>> A few seconds later,
they stop seeing it.

00:05:17.950 --> 00:05:22.890 align:middle line:84%
However, if we look carefully,
the object is still there.

00:05:22.890 --> 00:05:24.870 align:middle line:84%
Nick commented that
he heard something

00:05:24.870 --> 00:05:28.710 align:middle line:84%
on the news, something about
Russia from the military,

00:05:28.710 --> 00:05:31.770 align:middle line:84%
while Richard replies that
it is not from the Russians,

00:05:31.770 --> 00:05:33.810 align:middle line:90%
that it is from the Pentagon.

00:05:33.810 --> 00:05:36.780 align:middle line:84%
Finally, Richard asks
them to turn on the radio

00:05:36.780 --> 00:05:38.460 align:middle line:90%
to listen to the news.

00:05:38.460 --> 00:05:41.570 align:middle line:84%
The authenticity of
these images is evident.

00:05:41.570 --> 00:05:42.616 align:middle line:90%
>> --Russia.

00:05:42.616 --> 00:05:43.416 align:middle line:90%
Military.

00:05:43.416 --> 00:05:44.400 align:middle line:90%
>> No.

00:05:44.400 --> 00:05:46.370 align:middle line:90%
It's not Russia.

00:05:46.370 --> 00:05:47.990 align:middle line:90%
It's Pentagon.

00:05:47.990 --> 00:05:49.445 align:middle line:90%
>> I've seen it already, man.

00:05:49.445 --> 00:05:50.620 align:middle line:90%
It's the new stealth bomber.

00:05:50.620 --> 00:05:52.760 align:middle line:90%
It was announced on the news.

00:05:52.760 --> 00:05:53.795 align:middle line:90%
You know.

00:05:53.795 --> 00:05:54.785 align:middle line:90%
>> No, man.

00:05:54.785 --> 00:06:07.620 align:middle line:90%


00:06:07.620 --> 00:06:08.420 align:middle line:90%
Turn on the radio.

00:06:08.420 --> 00:06:10.500 align:middle line:90%
They should tell us something.

00:06:10.500 --> 00:06:13.660 align:middle line:90%
Turn on the radio.

00:06:13.660 --> 00:06:16.390 align:middle line:84%
>> Richard, whose full
name is Richard Wilson,

00:06:16.390 --> 00:06:20.050 align:middle line:84%
did not express any fear
that his name was known.

00:06:20.050 --> 00:06:22.990 align:middle line:84%
He was born in
Oregon in California,

00:06:22.990 --> 00:06:24.880 align:middle line:84%
currently lives
in Ireland, and is

00:06:24.880 --> 00:06:27.340 align:middle line:84%
dedicated to representing
musical bands that

00:06:27.340 --> 00:06:31.060 align:middle line:84%
perform at different
concerts around the world.

00:06:31.060 --> 00:06:33.880 align:middle line:84%
On December 19, he was
visiting Washington

00:06:33.880 --> 00:06:36.880 align:middle line:84%
and met Nick, a colleague
from the university.

00:06:36.880 --> 00:06:38.590 align:middle line:90%
This is his testimony.

00:06:38.590 --> 00:06:41.170 align:middle line:90%


00:06:41.170 --> 00:06:44.440 align:middle line:84%
>> Can you tell me what were you
doing the morning of December

00:06:44.440 --> 00:06:49.594 align:middle line:84%
19 in Washington, DC
near the Pentagon?

00:06:49.594 --> 00:06:52.810 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, we were coming
back from a friend's house.

00:06:52.810 --> 00:06:57.100 align:middle line:90%
And I was with Nick.

00:06:57.100 --> 00:06:59.770 align:middle line:90%
We were in a cab.

00:06:59.770 --> 00:07:03.640 align:middle line:84%
And it was about
4:00 in the morning.

00:07:03.640 --> 00:07:05.650 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, about 4:00 in the morning.

00:07:05.650 --> 00:07:12.760 align:middle line:10%
And just driving down the
road, and then up in the--

00:07:12.760 --> 00:07:19.205 align:middle line:10%
above the Pentagon, I
saw this pyramid shape.

00:07:19.205 --> 00:07:25.060 align:middle line:84%
And on the bottom, it
seemed darker than the rest.

00:07:25.060 --> 00:07:30.820 align:middle line:84%
My first thought was, it's a
hologram or a trick, a hoax,

00:07:30.820 --> 00:07:32.420 align:middle line:90%
some kind of trick.

00:07:32.420 --> 00:07:34.270 align:middle line:84%
Somebody putting this
hologram up there.

00:07:34.270 --> 00:07:37.450 align:middle line:90%


00:07:37.450 --> 00:07:43.360 align:middle line:84%
But then the more I looked,
I thought maybe it's not.

00:07:43.360 --> 00:07:47.530 align:middle line:84%
And then we drove a little
bit, and it was just

00:07:47.530 --> 00:07:51.910 align:middle line:84%
a couple of minutes later,
and when we turned around--

00:07:51.910 --> 00:07:55.690 align:middle line:84%
and the driver
couldn't see anything.

00:07:55.690 --> 00:07:57.970 align:middle line:84%
And then when we turned
around, it was gone.

00:07:57.970 --> 00:07:59.360 align:middle line:90%
There was nothing in the sky.

00:07:59.360 --> 00:08:05.280 align:middle line:84%
It was just that couple
minutes there, gone.

00:08:05.280 --> 00:08:06.610 align:middle line:90%
And we couldn't hear anything.

00:08:06.610 --> 00:08:15.340 align:middle line:84%
There was no sound, no humming,
no electrical noise, nothing.

00:08:15.340 --> 00:08:20.830 align:middle line:84%
The sound of a couple airplanes
over the head, and then

00:08:20.830 --> 00:08:21.650 align:middle line:90%
some cars.

00:08:21.650 --> 00:08:22.450 align:middle line:90%
That's it.

00:08:22.450 --> 00:08:24.390 align:middle line:90%
It was nothing.

00:08:24.390 --> 00:08:25.190 align:middle line:90%
So.

00:08:25.190 --> 00:08:29.330 align:middle line:90%


00:08:29.330 --> 00:08:33.530 align:middle line:84%
And then nothing else the
rest of the night, so.

00:08:33.530 --> 00:08:34.910 align:middle line:84%
>> Can it be like
an ancient god?

00:08:34.910 --> 00:08:35.710 align:middle line:90%
You know.

00:08:35.710 --> 00:08:38.190 align:middle line:84%
>> And what happened
you recorded this?

00:08:38.190 --> 00:08:40.810 align:middle line:90%
Were you able to record this?

00:08:40.810 --> 00:08:41.610 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, we both--

00:08:41.610 --> 00:08:43.504 align:middle line:84%
well, we tried to
record it on our phones,

00:08:43.504 --> 00:08:46.380 align:middle line:90%
and that didn't work.

00:08:46.380 --> 00:08:50.310 align:middle line:84%
I couldn't see
anything in the phone.

00:08:50.310 --> 00:08:52.050 align:middle line:84%
And so then we
used Nick's camera.

00:08:52.050 --> 00:08:54.360 align:middle line:84%
And I don't know what
kind of camera he's got,

00:08:54.360 --> 00:08:59.700 align:middle line:84%
but we used the
camera back and forth.

00:08:59.700 --> 00:09:03.965 align:middle line:84%

didn't see it.

it or he didn't see it, so.

it can't be a joke,

00:16:43.243 --> 00:16:44.660 align:middle line:84%
but he wasn't so
interested in it.

00:16:44.660 --> 00:16:46.910 align:middle line:84%
He was interested, I think,
in just getting his money,

00:16:46.910 --> 00:16:49.340 align:middle line:84%
and going home, and
seeing his family.

00:16:49.340 --> 00:16:53.530 align:middle line:84%
So my first reaction was,
this is very strange.

00:16:53.530 --> 00:16:56.570 align:middle line:84%
And my first reaction--
well, my second reaction was,

00:16:56.570 --> 00:16:58.345 align:middle line:90%
we got to record this.

00:16:58.345 --> 00:17:02.930 align:middle line:84%
And my third reaction was, why
is it just around the Pentagon?

00:17:02.930 --> 00:17:05.660 align:middle line:84%
Why did I never see
anything like this before,

00:17:05.660 --> 00:17:08.270 align:middle line:90%
and why am I only seeing it now?

00:17:08.270 --> 00:17:10.780 align:middle line:84%
And yeah, I thought it
was weird at the Pentagon,

00:17:10.780 --> 00:17:13.880 align:middle line:84%
early in the morning, not
too many people around.

00:17:13.880 --> 00:17:18.235 align:middle line:84%
My first reaction was,
what the hell is this?

00:17:18.235 --> 00:17:22.310 align:middle line:84%
>> Then he was asked if there
was a possibility that this was

00:17:22.310 --> 00:17:24.119 align:middle line:90%
a hologram.

00:17:24.119 --> 00:17:26.710 align:middle line:84%
>> I've seen some
holograms before.

00:17:26.710 --> 00:17:29.730 align:middle line:84%
Not very often, but I've seen
holograms from time to time.

00:17:29.730 --> 00:17:33.775 align:middle line:84%
And if this was a
hologram, it was a--

00:17:33.775 --> 00:17:34.640 align:middle line:90%
I don't know.

00:17:34.640 --> 00:17:38.330 align:middle line:84%
It was a very, very
professionally done

00:17:38.330 --> 00:17:41.270 align:middle line:84%
and probably very
expensive hologram, Jaime.

00:17:41.270 --> 00:17:46.720 align:middle line:84%
And I'm more convinced that
it was something that was--

00:17:46.720 --> 00:17:51.110 align:middle line:84%
I don't know, a cloaked
type of flying machine,

00:17:51.110 --> 00:17:53.510 align:middle line:90%
or something from the--

00:17:53.510 --> 00:17:54.855 align:middle line:90%
not from this world.

00:17:54.855 --> 00:17:56.480 align:middle line:84%
Or certainly something
that I had never

00:17:56.480 --> 00:17:59.540 align:middle line:84%
seen before, because
just trying to put

00:17:59.540 --> 00:18:01.700 align:middle line:90%
my finger on what it was is--

00:18:01.700 --> 00:18:04.352 align:middle line:84%
it's still making me a bit crazy
trying to think what it was.

00:18:04.352 --> 00:18:06.560 align:middle line:84%
And when I mention the story
to people, when they see

00:18:06.560 --> 00:18:10.090 align:middle line:90%
the footage, they still think--

00:18:10.090 --> 00:18:12.110 align:middle line:84%
I don't know, they think
I'm imagining things,

00:18:12.110 --> 00:18:14.120 align:middle line:84%
and I'm doing my best
to convince people

00:18:14.120 --> 00:18:17.360 align:middle line:84%
that I'm not crazy, and there's
something real going on.

00:18:17.360 --> 00:18:19.710 align:middle line:84%
There was something very
odd going on that night.

00:18:19.710 --> 00:18:20.780 align:middle line:90%
>> How did you record it?

00:18:20.780 --> 00:18:24.780 align:middle line:84%
Because it seems that both
of you took the camera.

00:18:24.780 --> 00:18:25.580 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:18:25.580 --> 00:18:26.810 align:middle line:90%
Well, we took turns.

00:18:26.810 --> 00:18:28.650 align:middle line:84%
Richard used the
camera for some time.

00:18:28.650 --> 00:18:32.077 align:middle line:84%
I used the camera for some
time, because I guess both of us

00:18:32.077 --> 00:18:33.410 align:middle line:90%
wanted to get a good look at it.

00:18:33.410 --> 00:18:35.520 align:middle line:84%
Both of us wanted
to get some proof

00:18:35.520 --> 00:18:38.190 align:middle line:84%
to make sure that we
weren't both going crazy.

00:18:38.190 --> 00:18:43.080 align:middle line:84%
He wanted, I guess, to prove his
theory of it being a hologram.

00:18:43.080 --> 00:18:46.470 align:middle line:84%
I wanted to just get a better
understanding of what it was,

00:18:46.470 --> 00:18:48.340 align:middle line:84%
just to try to figure
it out in more detail.

00:18:48.340 --> 00:18:50.340 align:middle line:84%
So luckily, we had
the camera with us,

00:18:50.340 --> 00:18:51.630 align:middle line:90%
and we were able to get--

00:18:51.630 --> 00:18:53.078 align:middle line:84%
yeah, get a little
bit of footage.

00:18:53.078 --> 00:18:54.870 align:middle line:84%
Not a lot, but at least
we got a little bit

00:18:54.870 --> 00:18:59.350 align:middle line:84%
of footage of this thing,
this object, or this thing

00:18:59.350 --> 00:19:01.600 align:middle line:90%
in the sky.

00:19:01.600 --> 00:19:04.690 align:middle line:84%
>> Nick was the first to record
the object with his camera from

00:19:04.690 --> 00:19:05.830 align:middle line:90%
the front seat.

00:19:05.830 --> 00:19:11.020 align:middle line:84%
And later, Richard did it from
the rear seat on the left side.

00:19:11.020 --> 00:19:13.420 align:middle line:84%
>> Yes, I think both of
us probably took turns,

00:19:13.420 --> 00:19:18.948 align:middle line:84%
although I definitely was
recording longer than he was,

00:19:18.948 --> 00:19:19.990 align:middle line:90%
because it was my camera.

00:19:19.990 --> 00:19:21.010 align:middle line:90%
[CHUCKLES]

00:19:21.010 --> 00:19:23.860 align:middle line:84%
I wasn't going to give my
friend the camera for too long.

00:19:23.860 --> 00:19:26.110 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, no, I was [MUMBLES].

00:19:26.110 --> 00:19:29.680 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, there is
something very interesting.

00:19:29.680 --> 00:19:34.820 align:middle line:84%
We have been analyzing the
review that Richard provided

00:19:34.820 --> 00:19:39.010 align:middle line:84%
us, and we can see
that if you check it

00:19:39.010 --> 00:19:43.290 align:middle line:84%
out again, at the end, at
the last part of the video,

00:19:43.290 --> 00:19:45.660 align:middle line:90%
you say it's gone.

00:19:45.660 --> 00:19:47.460 align:middle line:90%
And it's still there.

00:19:47.460 --> 00:19:48.820 align:middle line:90%
It's still there.

00:19:48.820 --> 00:19:52.960 align:middle line:84%
It seems that you lost the
track-- you couldn't see it

00:19:52.960 --> 00:19:56.140 align:middle line:84%
with your eyes, but the
camera was still recording

00:19:56.140 --> 00:19:57.900 align:middle line:90%
the image of the pyramid.

00:19:57.900 --> 00:19:58.737 align:middle line:90%
>> Ah.

00:19:58.737 --> 00:20:00.820 align:middle line:84%
So the camera still-- when
we thought it was gone,

00:20:00.820 --> 00:20:02.600 align:middle line:90%
the camera still picked up--

00:20:02.600 --> 00:20:04.460 align:middle line:90%
I have to check it again, yeah.

00:20:04.460 --> 00:20:07.155 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I remember him
saying, yeah, it's gone.

00:20:07.155 --> 00:20:09.355 align:middle line:84%
And I remember myself
thinking, yeah, that's it.

00:20:09.355 --> 00:20:10.480 align:middle line:90%
We won't get anything else.

00:20:10.480 --> 00:20:12.443 align:middle line:84%
We'll have to look
at it again and see.

00:20:12.443 --> 00:20:13.360 align:middle line:90%
So it's still visible?

00:20:13.360 --> 00:20:15.780 align:middle line:84%
The video, you looked
at it in more detail,

00:20:15.780 --> 00:20:16.580 align:middle line:90%
it's still visible?

00:20:16.580 --> 00:20:16.970 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:20:16.970 --> 00:20:18.160 align:middle line:90%
It's still there.

00:20:18.160 --> 00:20:20.040 align:middle line:84%
Unfortunately, you
didn't realize,

00:20:20.040 --> 00:20:22.270 align:middle line:84%
or Richard didn't
realize, because you could

00:20:22.270 --> 00:20:25.070 align:middle line:90%
have continued the recording.

00:20:25.070 --> 00:20:26.090 align:middle line:90%
>> We could have.

00:20:26.090 --> 00:20:28.710 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, I think the taxi driver
had had enough at that stage.

00:20:28.710 --> 00:20:32.360 align:middle line:84%
We'd already gone around
the Pentagon a few times.

00:20:32.360 --> 00:20:34.650 align:middle line:84%
He probably thought we
were going to keep going,

00:20:34.650 --> 00:20:36.270 align:middle line:84%
and as I said, he
was probably ready--

00:20:36.270 --> 00:20:37.270 align:middle line:90%
I was ready to get home.

00:20:37.270 --> 00:20:39.760 align:middle line:84%
We were all ready to get home
at 4 o'clock in the morning.

00:20:39.760 --> 00:20:43.040 align:middle line:84%
We were tired, so the driver to
circle-- how many times did he

00:20:43.040 --> 00:20:44.745 align:middle line:90%
circle around?

00:20:44.745 --> 00:20:46.030 align:middle line:90%
Eh, two, three times--

00:20:46.030 --> 00:20:49.300 align:middle line:84%
I think about three times,
the driver circled around.

00:20:49.300 --> 00:20:51.710 align:middle line:90%
So we were able to--

00:20:51.710 --> 00:20:55.270 align:middle line:84%
there wasn't much light from
it, but there was some--

00:20:55.270 --> 00:20:57.620 align:middle line:84%
probably the bottom of
it that was more visible,

00:20:57.620 --> 00:21:02.320 align:middle line:84%
so we were able to see
that it was in our circle.

00:21:02.320 --> 00:21:05.470 align:middle line:10%
We were moving around,
and the distance it moved

00:21:05.470 --> 00:21:08.110 align:middle line:10%
was not very far,
because we're talking

00:21:08.110 --> 00:21:11.470 align:middle line:10%
about a fairly big block
here, and we moved around.

00:21:11.470 --> 00:21:13.960 align:middle line:84%
So I guess the
distance that it moved

00:21:13.960 --> 00:21:16.010 align:middle line:90%
wasn't far from the Pentagon.

00:21:16.010 --> 00:21:18.250 align:middle line:10%
It was visible that
it wasn't moving far.

00:21:18.250 --> 00:21:22.750 align:middle line:10%
And even because it was
so dark, and because also,

00:21:22.750 --> 00:21:25.750 align:middle line:10%
we couldn't-- the problem was
we couldn't open the windows.

00:21:25.750 --> 00:21:27.550 align:middle line:84%
We were thinking,
let's open the windows,

00:21:27.550 --> 00:21:29.650 align:middle line:84%
let's get a better
look with the camera.

00:21:29.650 --> 00:21:31.580 align:middle line:84%
Number one, I didn't
want to drop the camera,

00:21:31.580 --> 00:21:34.390 align:middle line:84%
and my father would
be going crazy.

00:21:34.390 --> 00:21:37.607 align:middle line:84%
And number two, who's to
say-- it was cold that night,

00:21:37.607 --> 00:21:39.940 align:middle line:84%
and we weren't too sure if
we were going to get a better

00:21:39.940 --> 00:21:45.990 align:middle line:84%
image or not if we had gone out,
opened the window of the taxi

00:21:45.990 --> 00:21:46.790 align:middle line:90%
that night.

00:21:46.790 --> 00:21:50.950 align:middle line:84%
It's hard to say really what
difference it would have made.

00:21:50.950 --> 00:21:54.520 align:middle line:84%
I think the quality was OK, but
it just wasn't moving very far.

00:21:54.520 --> 00:21:57.760 align:middle line:84%
We did the round, and
from our experience,

00:21:57.760 --> 00:22:00.280 align:middle line:84%
from what we could
see, this thing,

00:22:00.280 --> 00:22:04.012 align:middle line:84%
it just didn't move
far from the Pentagon.

00:22:04.012 --> 00:22:08.680 align:middle line:84%
>> Both testimonies confirm
that the morning of December 19,

00:22:08.680 --> 00:22:13.420 align:middle line:84%
a flying object of about 100
and 200 meters remained above

00:22:13.420 --> 00:22:14.320 align:middle line:90%
the Pentagon.

00:22:14.320 --> 00:22:16.030 align:middle line:84%
>> This is a fucking
alien invasion.

00:22:16.030 --> 00:22:17.170 align:middle line:90%
>> No doubt.

00:22:17.170 --> 00:22:19.170 align:middle line:90%
However, why?

00:22:19.170 --> 00:22:22.890 align:middle line:84%
It is one of the most
restricted places on the planet.

00:22:22.890 --> 00:22:24.415 align:middle line:90%
It is not any kind of place.

00:22:24.415 --> 00:22:27.530 align:middle line:90%


00:22:27.530 --> 00:22:28.720 align:middle line:90%
Why there?

00:22:28.720 --> 00:22:30.140 align:middle line:90%
Was it a warning?

00:22:30.140 --> 00:22:31.730 align:middle line:90%
Was it a message?

00:22:31.730 --> 00:22:35.630 align:middle line:90%
Was it a communication attempt?

00:22:35.630 --> 00:22:39.380 align:middle line:84%
And why in the Kremlin and the
Pentagon, in the two countries

00:22:39.380 --> 00:22:42.530 align:middle line:84%
with the greatest nuclear
power in the world?

00:22:42.530 --> 00:22:44.420 align:middle line:84%
Robert Hastings is
a researcher who

00:22:44.420 --> 00:22:46.640 align:middle line:84%
has most studied
the relationship

00:22:46.640 --> 00:22:49.040 align:middle line:84%
between the presence
of unidentified flying

00:22:49.040 --> 00:22:51.350 align:middle line:84%
objects and the development
of nuclear weapons.

00:22:51.350 --> 00:22:54.320 align:middle line:90%


00:22:54.320 --> 00:22:58.550 align:middle line:10%
>> We have technology that is
so advanced associated with UFOs

00:22:58.550 --> 00:23:01.100 align:middle line:10%
that they cannot be from
any country on Earth.

00:23:01.100 --> 00:23:03.020 align:middle line:10%
Therefore, I believe
we have visitors

00:23:03.020 --> 00:23:06.110 align:middle line:10%
from somewhere else in the
universe operating here

00:23:06.110 --> 00:23:07.640 align:middle line:10%
on planet Earth.

00:23:07.640 --> 00:23:10.760 align:middle line:84%
In my view, the fact
that UFO reports just

00:23:10.760 --> 00:23:13.640 align:middle line:84%
went through the roof,
skyrocketed dramatically

00:23:13.640 --> 00:23:17.210 align:middle line:84%
at the end of World War II, when
we developed nuclear weapons,

00:23:17.210 --> 00:23:19.940 align:middle line:84%
my view is that the
reason this activity

00:23:19.940 --> 00:23:23.360 align:middle line:84%
has increased since that
time is directly related

00:23:23.360 --> 00:23:24.900 align:middle line:90%
to nuclear weapons.

00:23:24.900 --> 00:23:27.050 align:middle line:84%
Whatever else is on
their agenda, whatever

00:23:27.050 --> 00:23:29.490 align:middle line:84%
else they're doing,
we have the documents,

00:23:29.490 --> 00:23:31.700 align:middle line:84%
we have the retired Air
Force personnel saying

00:23:31.700 --> 00:23:33.950 align:middle line:84%
that they monitor
our nuclear weapons

00:23:33.950 --> 00:23:36.260 align:middle line:84%
and interfere with their
functionality from time

00:23:36.260 --> 00:23:37.340 align:middle line:90%
to time.

00:23:37.340 --> 00:23:42.080 align:middle line:84%
I think, therefore, that they
are trying to warn mankind--

00:23:42.080 --> 00:23:45.770 align:middle line:84%
Washington and Moscow, who have
most of the nuclear weapons--

00:23:45.770 --> 00:23:47.300 align:middle line:90%
you're playing with fire.

00:23:47.300 --> 00:23:49.880 align:middle line:84%
You are risking
human civilization.

00:23:49.880 --> 00:23:52.010 align:middle line:84%
You are risking the
environmental integrity

00:23:52.010 --> 00:23:56.420 align:middle line:84%
of your planet if you actually
shoot these nuclear weapons off

00:23:56.420 --> 00:23:58.350 align:middle line:90%
and engage in war with them.

00:23:58.350 --> 00:24:01.730 align:middle line:10%
So in my view, based on the
available evidence, the best

00:24:01.730 --> 00:24:05.210 align:middle line:10%
scenario, the best case
for what is occurring

00:24:05.210 --> 00:24:07.820 align:middle line:10%
is that someone is
trying to warn humanity

00:24:07.820 --> 00:24:11.080 align:middle line:10%
that we are playing with fire.

00:24:11.080 --> 00:24:13.120 align:middle line:10%
>> What could be the
consequences of announcing

00:24:13.120 --> 00:24:17.230 align:middle line:10%
an event like the one that
occurred on December 19, 2018,

00:24:17.230 --> 00:24:19.596 align:middle line:10%
in Washington, DC?

00:24:19.596 --> 00:24:25.000 align:middle line:84%
>> I think these incidents where
you have huge UFOs hovering

00:24:25.000 --> 00:24:27.850 align:middle line:84%
over major cities from time
to time over the last several

00:24:27.850 --> 00:24:33.610 align:middle line:84%
decades all around the world
is a suggestion that they are

00:24:33.610 --> 00:24:34.720 align:middle line:90%
saying, look at us.

00:24:34.720 --> 00:24:35.890 align:middle line:90%
We're real, we're here.

00:24:35.890 --> 00:24:38.710 align:middle line:84%
And to me, that suggests
they intend to open contact.

00:24:38.710 --> 00:24:41.410 align:middle line:90%
>> Are they dangerous?

00:24:41.410 --> 00:24:42.440 align:middle line:90%
>> Are they dangerous?

00:24:42.440 --> 00:24:43.810 align:middle line:90%
That's the question.

00:24:43.810 --> 00:24:46.240 align:middle line:84%
The Pentagon would say yes
because they're interfering

00:24:46.240 --> 00:24:47.710 align:middle line:90%
with our nuclear weapons.

00:24:47.710 --> 00:24:51.820 align:middle line:84%
The CIA would say yes
for the same reason.

00:24:51.820 --> 00:24:54.070 align:middle line:84%
Even if they're
not hostile, even

00:24:54.070 --> 00:24:56.650 align:middle line:84%
if they don't mean to
conquer us or do things that

00:24:56.650 --> 00:24:59.920 align:middle line:84%
are bad for humanity,
there is still

00:24:59.920 --> 00:25:03.220 align:middle line:84%
a number of repercussions, just
the fact that they're here.

00:25:03.220 --> 00:25:05.140 align:middle line:90%
Human religion could be changed.

00:25:05.140 --> 00:25:07.970 align:middle line:90%
Societal institutions.

00:25:07.970 --> 00:25:10.000 align:middle line:84%
The many, many people
all around the planet who

00:25:10.000 --> 00:25:12.820 align:middle line:84%
think that UFOs don't
exist are suddenly

00:25:12.820 --> 00:25:15.100 align:middle line:84%
going to be deeply shocked
that they were wrong,

00:25:15.100 --> 00:25:17.050 align:middle line:90%
and that UFOs do exist.

00:25:17.050 --> 00:25:19.950 align:middle line:90%
So there are all sorts of--

00:25:19.950 --> 00:25:27.130 align:middle line:84%
and even, when 9/11 occurred,
the stock market collapsed.

00:25:27.130 --> 00:25:28.270 align:middle line:90%
The stock market fell.

00:25:28.270 --> 00:25:31.150 align:middle line:84%
We had to close the stock market
for three days, the first time

00:25:31.150 --> 00:25:33.917 align:middle line:84%
since the Great Depression,
to prevent the stocks

00:25:33.917 --> 00:25:36.250 align:middle line:84%
from going lower, because
people were so shocked by what

00:25:36.250 --> 00:25:37.570 align:middle line:90%
happened in 9/11.

00:25:37.570 --> 00:25:40.930 align:middle line:84%
Can you imagine that even if the
president of the United States

00:25:40.930 --> 00:25:44.260 align:middle line:84%
gets on television and says,
we have alien visitors,

00:25:44.260 --> 00:25:46.270 align:middle line:84%
don't worry,
they're not hostile,

00:25:46.270 --> 00:25:48.730 align:middle line:84%
some number of Americans are
going to run to the banks,

00:25:48.730 --> 00:25:51.670 align:middle line:84%
going to call their stockbroker
and say, take my money out,

00:25:51.670 --> 00:25:53.070 align:middle line:90%
give it to me, I want cash.

00:25:53.070 --> 00:25:55.180 align:middle line:84%
They're going to bury
it in their backyard.

00:25:55.180 --> 00:25:57.730 align:middle line:84%
There could be grave
economic consequences

00:25:57.730 --> 00:25:58.720 align:middle line:90%
to that announcement.

00:25:58.720 --> 00:26:01.270 align:middle line:84%
Even if the president
says, they're not hostile,

00:26:01.270 --> 00:26:03.440 align:middle line:84%
don't worry, people
are going to say,

00:26:03.440 --> 00:26:06.220 align:middle line:84%
well, you lied to us
before about aliens,

00:26:06.220 --> 00:26:07.570 align:middle line:90%
why should we trust you now?

00:26:07.570 --> 00:26:08.795 align:middle line:90%
I want my money.

00:26:08.795 --> 00:26:11.650 align:middle line:10%
