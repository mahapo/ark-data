It is a polyhedron

This data imply
that the tetrahedra

00:10:08.430 --> 00:10:11.550 align:middle line:10%
are convex polyhedra,

almost three hours,

00:23:05.560 --> 00:23:07.700 align:middle line:90%
the Kremlin for several hours.

00:23:07.700 --> 00:23:09.820 align:middle line:84%
And what that tells us
is that the Russians

00:23:09.820 --> 00:23:11.950 align:middle line:90%
knew exactly who this was.

00:23:11.950 --> 00:23:14.180 align:middle line:84%
That this was a group
of extraterrestrials

00:23:14.180 --> 00:23:16.840 align:middle line:84%
that had very powerful
technologies, much more

00:23:16.840 --> 00:23:19.570 align:middle line:84%
powerful than anything
that the Russians had.

00:23:19.570 --> 00:23:23.320 align:middle line:84%
And if the Russians
tried to shoot it down,

00:23:23.320 --> 00:23:26.260 align:middle line:84%
basically, they
would not succeed

00:23:26.260 --> 00:23:28.060 align:middle line:84%
and all they would
eventually do was

00:23:28.060 --> 00:23:31.990 align:middle line:84%
basically demonstrate to
the Russian population

00:23:31.990 --> 00:23:36.100 align:middle line:84%
that there is a
force out there that

00:23:36.100 --> 00:23:40.960 align:middle line:84%
is much more powerful
than the Russian military.

00:23:40.960 --> 00:23:44.200 align:middle line:84%
>> Then you think is was on
purpose not to do anything

00:23:44.200 --> 00:23:48.400 align:middle line:84%
because it would be
worthless to do it?

00:23:48.400 --> 00:23:50.920 align:middle line:84%
>> I think that that was
the decision that was taken

00:23:50.920 --> 00:23:53.860 align:middle line:84%
by the Russian military,
by the Kremlin,

00:23:53.860 --> 00:23:56.650 align:middle line:84%
not to respond in
any way militarily,

00:23:56.650 --> 00:23:58.960 align:middle line:84%
because they knew
they wouldn't succeed,

00:23:58.960 --> 00:24:04.360 align:middle line:84%
and to just ignore it and to not
allow any major Russian media

00:24:04.360 --> 00:24:05.650 align:middle line:90%
to discuss it.

00:24:05.650 --> 00:24:08.297 align:middle line:84%
One of the things that I
found in my investigation

00:24:08.297 --> 00:24:09.880 align:middle line:84%
was that there were
a number of people

00:24:09.880 --> 00:24:12.490 align:middle line:84%
that took photographs and
video in trying to put this up

00:24:12.490 --> 00:24:13.570 align:middle line:90%
on the internet.

00:24:13.570 --> 00:24:18.490 align:middle line:84%
And the Russian intelligence
was removing that evidence

00:24:18.490 --> 00:24:21.580 align:middle line:84%
and basically silencing
people to make

00:24:21.580 --> 00:24:24.010 align:middle line:84%
it look like it was
a non-event or make

00:24:24.010 --> 00:24:28.060 align:middle line:84%
it look like it was just a few
people trying to create a hoax.

00:24:28.060 --> 00:24:31.300 align:middle line:84%
But in fact, this was a very
real, very serious event.

00:24:31.300 --> 00:24:34.120 align:middle line:84%
The Russian government
tried to cover it up.

00:24:34.120 --> 00:24:38.440 align:middle line:84%
But nevertheless, we
did have a few people

00:24:38.440 --> 00:24:42.310 align:middle line:84%

this to the internet.
