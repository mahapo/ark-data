>> On August 16, 1945, barely a
month after an atomic bomb was

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:46.790 align:middle line:10%
detonated in New Mexico, only 10
miles away from the bomb site,

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:51.240 align:middle line:10%
a ship fell from the sky and
members of the Padilla family

00:00:51.240 --> 00:00:52.830 align:middle line:10%
saw it happen.

00:00:52.830 --> 00:00:57.536 align:middle line:10%
This detonation was later
called name Trinity.

00:00:57.536 --> 00:01:01.770 align:middle line:84%
>> The ship measured about
five meters high and 10 meters

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:04.239 align:middle line:90%
in diameter.

00:01:04.239 --> 00:01:09.210 align:middle line:84%
It crashed into a brick tower
that had an antenna on top.

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:11.340 align:middle line:84%
After impacting
the tower, it fell

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:15.150 align:middle line:84%
to the ground, skid
for about 70 meters

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:17.850 align:middle line:84%
until it stopped on
a sandbank, which

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:21.730 align:middle line:90%
was part of an old stream bed.

00:01:21.730 --> 00:01:24.220 align:middle line:84%
The object, or
airship, was damaged

00:01:24.220 --> 00:01:29.200 align:middle line:84%
and had a hole in it more than
3 meters high and 2 meters wide.

00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:33.190 align:middle line:84%
Two young children-- Jose
Padilla, seven years old,

00:01:33.190 --> 00:01:38.470 align:middle line:84%
and Remigio Baca, Reme, six
years old-- saw the crash.

00:01:38.470 --> 00:01:40.420 align:middle line:84%
With their binoculars,
they observed

00:01:40.420 --> 00:01:43.150 align:middle line:84%
odd looking beings that
moved inside the ship

00:01:43.150 --> 00:01:45.195 align:middle line:90%
for almost two hours.

00:01:45.195 --> 00:01:47.320 align:middle line:84%
They could see that they
were about the same height

00:01:47.320 --> 00:01:50.950 align:middle line:84%
as they were and stood a
little more than a meter tall.

00:01:50.950 --> 00:01:54.790 align:middle line:84%
They had four fingers on
each hand, elongated eyes,

00:01:54.790 --> 00:01:57.790 align:middle line:84%
and no hair or
ears on their head.

00:01:57.790 --> 00:02:01.100 align:middle line:84%
They were wearing suits which
were tight to their bodies.

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:04.270 align:middle line:84%
One of the beings was lying on
the ground and did not move.

00:02:04.270 --> 00:02:07.160 align:middle line:90%


00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:17.140 align:middle line:10%
This strange occurrence
happened on August 20, 1945.

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:20.710 align:middle line:84%
About 48 hours later,
the army showed up.

00:02:20.710 --> 00:02:26.640 align:middle line:84%
Soon the site was fenced off,
and an access gate was built.

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:31.390 align:middle line:84%
The men examined the ship
and searched for parts.

00:02:31.390 --> 00:02:34.000 align:middle line:84%
For one week, seven
military personnel

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:38.040 align:middle line:84%
hunted for any other remains
that might have been missed.

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:40.300 align:middle line:84%
Every day, the two
children returned

00:02:40.300 --> 00:02:43.570 align:middle line:84%
to observe them at a distance
with their binoculars.

00:02:43.570 --> 00:02:45.760 align:middle line:84%
On the last day the
army was there--

00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:49.300 align:middle line:84%
August 28, 1945--
the ship was loaded

00:02:49.300 --> 00:02:52.240 align:middle line:84%
onto a military
transport vehicle.

00:02:52.240 --> 00:02:54.250 align:middle line:84%
That night, they
left their cargo

00:02:54.250 --> 00:02:58.390 align:middle line:84%
unattended and went to the
Owl Bar Cafe in San Antonio.

00:02:58.390 --> 00:03:02.200 align:middle line:10%
While they were gone, Jose and
Reme climbed into the truck,

00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:05.740 align:middle line:10%
entered the object, extracted
a souvenir from inside,

00:03:05.740 --> 00:03:08.170 align:middle line:10%
then took it home, and hid it.

00:03:08.170 --> 00:03:10.780 align:middle line:84%
Later, military personnel
showed up at their homes

00:03:10.780 --> 00:03:12.700 align:middle line:90%
but couldn't find anything.

00:03:12.700 --> 00:03:15.340 align:middle line:84%
Then something happened
that seems to be straight

00:03:15.340 --> 00:03:18.430 align:middle line:90%
out of a science fiction story.

00:03:18.430 --> 00:03:21.450 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, we were having
breakfast one morning.

00:03:21.450 --> 00:03:23.500 align:middle line:90%
And so the door--

00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:24.750 align:middle line:90%
I heard the knock of the door.

00:03:24.750 --> 00:03:26.667 align:middle line:84%
And of course, I answered
it, opened the door,

00:03:26.667 --> 00:03:27.510 align:middle line:90%
and there he was.

00:03:27.510 --> 00:03:29.010 align:middle line:84%
He says, I need to
talk to your dad.

00:03:29.010 --> 00:03:31.290 align:middle line:84%
And my dad heard that--
come on in, you know.

00:03:31.290 --> 00:03:34.273 align:middle line:84%
Hey, he says, come on in
and have a cup of coffee.

00:03:34.273 --> 00:03:36.440 align:middle line:84%
We're just about done with
breakfast here, you know.

00:03:36.440 --> 00:03:38.700 align:middle line:84%
And so he gave him a cup
of coffee, and he sat down.

00:03:38.700 --> 00:03:40.450 align:middle line:84%
And they talked about
all times, you know,

00:03:40.450 --> 00:03:43.680 align:middle line:84%
because my dad used to do
that kind of work, too.

00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:46.800 align:middle line:84%
And so he said, well, you
know, what do you got?

00:03:46.800 --> 00:03:48.900 align:middle line:84%
And he says, well-- he
says, you know, Alejandro,

00:03:48.900 --> 00:03:49.775 align:middle line:90%
I hate to bother you.

00:03:49.775 --> 00:03:54.790 align:middle line:84%
But last night, I was asleep,
and I heard this noise.

00:03:54.790 --> 00:03:56.910 align:middle line:84%
And I looked outside
the window, and there's

00:03:56.910 --> 00:04:00.560 align:middle line:84%
this light right
by the well, right

00:04:00.560 --> 00:04:03.720 align:middle line:84%
where you've got all that
wood, the pile of wood.

00:04:03.720 --> 00:04:05.860 align:middle line:84%
And there's this
light out there.

00:04:05.860 --> 00:04:08.910 align:middle line:84%
And then the next
thing I know, there's

00:04:08.910 --> 00:04:12.480 align:middle line:84%
these two ugly creatures
that are standing right

00:04:12.480 --> 00:04:13.490 align:middle line:90%
in front of me.

00:04:13.490 --> 00:04:17.220 align:middle line:84%
And he says, what
ugly creatures?

00:04:17.220 --> 00:04:19.890 align:middle line:84%
He says, well, you
know, they were there.

00:04:19.890 --> 00:04:23.760 align:middle line:84%
and they had their fingers
pointed down under the floor.

00:04:23.760 --> 00:04:26.708 align:middle line:90%
And they're saying, Tesoro.

00:04:26.708 --> 00:04:28.050 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:04:28.050 --> 00:04:30.060 align:middle line:84%
When they said that,
my heart kind of

00:04:30.060 --> 00:04:32.400 align:middle line:84%
dropped because that's
the name of the piece.

00:04:32.400 --> 00:04:33.720 align:middle line:90%
That's a Tesoro.

00:04:33.720 --> 00:04:36.660 align:middle line:84%
That was our Tesoro,
our treasure.

00:04:36.660 --> 00:04:39.118 align:middle line:90%
That was our souvenir.

00:04:39.118 --> 00:04:41.660 align:middle line:84%
And I says, you know, all hell's
going to break loose, right?

00:04:41.660 --> 00:04:42.950 align:middle line:84%
Because now my dad's
going to find out.

00:04:42.950 --> 00:04:44.920 align:middle line:84%
He don't know nothing
about all this stuff.

00:04:44.920 --> 00:04:46.920 align:middle line:90%
You know, he can't be told.

00:04:46.920 --> 00:04:50.040 align:middle line:84%
Eddie suggested that he
not be told because he

00:04:50.040 --> 00:04:51.620 align:middle line:90%
worked for the government.

00:04:51.620 --> 00:04:54.420 align:middle line:84%
You know what they do to people
that talk about all this stuff?

00:04:54.420 --> 00:04:57.540 align:middle line:84%
They lose their jobs because
that's classified stuff,

00:04:57.540 --> 00:04:58.520 align:middle line:90%
you know.

00:04:58.520 --> 00:05:03.060 align:middle line:84%
So my dad says, well,
and what happened?

00:05:03.060 --> 00:05:08.220 align:middle line:84%
Well, he says, I grabbed
my gun, and these creatures

00:05:08.220 --> 00:05:09.720 align:middle line:90%
went through the wall.

00:05:09.720 --> 00:05:11.940 align:middle line:84%
He says, you won't
believe it, Alejandro.

00:05:11.940 --> 00:05:14.390 align:middle line:84%
They went right
through the wall.

00:05:14.390 --> 00:05:15.950 align:middle line:90%
And so my dad said, OK.

00:05:15.950 --> 00:05:18.210 align:middle line:84%
Well, let's go down
there and take a look.

00:05:18.210 --> 00:05:22.980 align:middle line:84%
And so he got a
shovel, got one of my--

00:05:22.980 --> 00:05:26.280 align:middle line:84%
my older brother,
and got a shovel,

00:05:26.280 --> 00:05:28.380 align:middle line:84%
and went over
across the street--

00:05:28.380 --> 00:05:31.090 align:middle line:90%
so maybe like 100 feet--

00:05:31.090 --> 00:05:32.700 align:middle line:90%
and went over to the room.

00:05:32.700 --> 00:05:34.500 align:middle line:90%
And they pulled the planks out.

00:05:34.500 --> 00:05:36.650 align:middle line:84%
And he says, OK,
where was he pointing?

00:05:36.650 --> 00:05:38.442 align:middle line:84%
It was right there in
the middle, you know.

00:05:38.442 --> 00:05:40.470 align:middle line:84%
So dug a hole
there in the middle

00:05:40.470 --> 00:05:42.990 align:middle line:90%
and didn't find anything.

00:05:42.990 --> 00:05:44.490 align:middle line:90%
I guess it wasn't there.

00:05:44.490 --> 00:05:46.266 align:middle line:90%
Oh, man.

00:05:46.266 --> 00:05:47.070 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:05:47.070 --> 00:05:47.900 align:middle line:90%


00:05:47.900 --> 00:05:48.880 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:05:48.880 --> 00:05:49.695 align:middle line:90%
Thank you, god.

00:05:49.695 --> 00:05:52.240 align:middle line:90%

>> Years later, Reme Baca showed
us the piece that he and his

00:05:55.870 --> 00:06:00.160 align:middle line:10%
friend had taken from that
ship more than 70 years ago.

00:06:00.160 --> 00:06:04.460 align:middle line:84%
The metal piece was part
of the central panel.

INTERPRETER: Yes.

00:06:11.090 --> 00:06:12.740 align:middle line:90%
That's from the inside.

00:06:12.740 --> 00:06:15.800 align:middle line:90%
It was like that in a--

00:06:15.800 --> 00:06:19.400 align:middle line:90%


00:06:19.400 --> 00:06:21.290 align:middle line:90%
oh yeah, in a panel.

00:06:21.290 --> 00:06:22.130 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:06:22.130 --> 00:06:24.150 align:middle line:90%
We didn't know what it was.

00:06:24.150 --> 00:06:26.510 align:middle line:84%
The reason that we
removed this piece

00:06:26.510 --> 00:06:29.030 align:middle line:84%
is that he wanted
something to take with us.

00:06:29.030 --> 00:06:30.500 align:middle line:90%
A lot of people we know--

00:06:30.500 --> 00:06:33.800 align:middle line:84%
brothers and cousins and
folks that were in the war--

00:06:33.800 --> 00:06:35.520 align:middle line:84%
asked me to bring
them something that we

00:06:35.520 --> 00:06:37.940 align:middle line:90%
could keep, like a memento.

00:06:37.940 --> 00:06:39.500 align:middle line:90%
So we understood that.

00:06:39.500 --> 00:06:41.500 align:middle line:84%
Anyway, this ship had
lots of stuff in it.

00:06:41.500 --> 00:06:44.780 align:middle line:84%
And we wanted something that we
could take home, something that

00:06:44.780 --> 00:06:47.190 align:middle line:90%
was from this strange ship.

00:06:47.190 --> 00:06:50.360 align:middle line:84%
So I said to Jose,
why don't we grab

00:06:50.360 --> 00:06:54.320 align:middle line:84%
something that looks, you
know, interesting, so we can

00:06:54.320 --> 00:06:56.480 align:middle line:90%
show our friends what we found?

00:06:56.480 --> 00:07:00.050 align:middle line:84%
So we managed to take a panel
piece and put it in our truck.

00:07:05.132 --> 00:07:06.590 align:middle line:84%
INTERPRETER: It's
really incredible

00:07:06.590 --> 00:07:11.030 align:middle line:84%
because we didn't have any idea
what we had or what its use was

00:07:11.030 --> 00:07:12.890 align:middle line:90%
or where it's from.

00:07:12.890 --> 00:07:16.730 align:middle line:84%
So here we are years later,
and I'm showing you the part

00:07:16.730 --> 00:07:18.850 align:middle line:90%
that we hid for so long.

00:07:18.850 --> 00:07:21.020 align:middle line:90%
It's really something, isn't it?

00:07:21.020 --> 00:07:24.170 align:middle line:84%
I said to Jose, I wonder
what it's made of?

00:07:24.170 --> 00:07:25.590 align:middle line:90%
He goes, I don't know.

00:07:25.590 --> 00:07:26.830 align:middle line:90%
Do you?

00:07:26.830 --> 00:07:28.700 align:middle line:90%
But we didn't know.

00:07:28.700 --> 00:07:30.610 align:middle line:90%
The ship looked strange.

00:07:30.610 --> 00:07:33.770 align:middle line:84%
Now I think about it, it
was maybe 14 feet tall,

00:07:33.770 --> 00:07:35.270 align:middle line:90%
30 or 40 feet long.

00:07:35.270 --> 00:07:36.740 align:middle line:90%
I'd never seen anything like it.

00:07:36.740 --> 00:07:38.390 align:middle line:84%
Jose, either-- we
were both amazed.

00:07:38.390 --> 00:07:41.760 align:middle line:84%
We were just kids, six
or seven years old.

00:07:41.760 --> 00:07:45.810 align:middle line:84%
And when you're that age,
you don't understand stuff.

in the laboratory in England.

The results astonished
the researchers.

00:07:54.600 --> 00:07:59.340 align:middle line:84%
The piece had carbon
nanotubes, a technology unknown

00:07:59.340 --> 00:08:02.230 align:middle line:90%
in the year of 1945.

00:08:02.230 --> 00:08:05.340 align:middle line:84%
They also found what appeared
to be circuits integrated

00:08:05.340 --> 00:08:08.550 align:middle line:84%
into the metal and probably
connected to a mainframe

00:08:08.550 --> 00:08:10.980 align:middle line:90%
computer in the ship.

If these evaluations
were correct,

00:08:13.890 --> 00:08:18.145 align:middle line:84%
the ship would far exceed
the technology of 1945.

is what they found.

00:08:23.930 --> 00:08:25.130 align:middle line:90%
This is a printout.

00:08:25.130 --> 00:08:26.690 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:08:26.690 --> 00:08:28.540 align:middle line:90%
That is some form of aluminum.

00:08:28.540 --> 00:08:33.030 align:middle line:84%
It maybe carbon, but
I'm not a scientist.

00:08:33.030 --> 00:08:36.679 align:middle line:84%
I guess they say it looks
like some kind of carbon

00:08:36.679 --> 00:08:38.260 align:middle line:90%
tubes of some kind.

00:08:38.260 --> 00:08:41.360 align:middle line:84%
We didn't fully understand
what that means--

00:08:41.360 --> 00:08:44.179 align:middle line:90%
carbon tubes.

00:08:44.179 --> 00:08:46.190 align:middle line:84%
Well, we started to
fire it up to see

00:08:46.190 --> 00:08:50.150 align:middle line:90%
what the carbon tubes did.

00:08:50.150 --> 00:08:51.980 align:middle line:10%
The reason it's
cold all the time

00:08:51.980 --> 00:08:57.920 align:middle line:10%
is because it transfers the
heat from one to the other.

00:08:57.920 --> 00:08:59.390 align:middle line:90%
And it goes out.

00:08:59.390 --> 00:09:02.390 align:middle line:90%
That's why it's cold.

00:09:02.390 --> 00:09:04.986 align:middle line:90%

They did.

00:09:09.540 --> 00:09:11.870 align:middle line:84%
I've been fascinated
by this experience.

00:09:11.870 --> 00:09:13.280 align:middle line:90%
That was one of the things.

00:09:13.280 --> 00:09:18.705 align:middle line:84%
The other thing they found and
didn't understand was this.

00:09:21.310 --> 00:09:23.340 align:middle line:84%

inside this part,

00:09:23.340 --> 00:09:26.840 align:middle line:90%

They looked like
centipedes like that.

00:09:40.770 --> 00:09:44.190 align:middle line:90%

technology.

00:09:48.180 --> 00:09:50.550 align:middle line:84%
And so they searched
for a scientist that

00:09:50.550 --> 00:09:52.724 align:middle line:90%
could interpret this discovery.

that's a first-- the very
first kind of printed circuits

And these printed circuits--
it's inside the metal?

00:10:17.940 --> 00:10:20.340 align:middle line:90%
>> That's right.

00:10:20.340 --> 00:10:25.410 align:middle line:90%
>> Then it's very sophisticated.

00:10:25.410 --> 00:10:29.130 align:middle line:10%
>> These designs are
thinner than a hair.

The measurements that
are printed on the image

00:10:31.350 --> 00:10:34.230 align:middle line:84%
show that regardless of the
function of these design

00:10:34.230 --> 00:10:41.710 align:middle line:84%
circuits, it is an unimaginable
technology for the 1940s.

00:10:41.710 --> 00:10:46.720 align:middle line:84%
>> When you are looking at
this piece and you're looking

00:10:46.720 --> 00:10:48.160 align:middle line:84%
at this, and we've
got a circuit,

00:10:48.160 --> 00:10:52.120 align:middle line:84%
an electrical circuit
that they had in there.

00:10:52.120 --> 00:11:01.320 align:middle line:84%
So how did that craft fly
when we did not see anywhere

00:11:01.320 --> 00:11:03.200 align:middle line:90%
where they had any engine?

00:11:03.200 --> 00:11:04.000 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:04.990 align:middle line:90%
There wasn't no motors.

00:11:04.990 --> 00:11:06.310 align:middle line:90%
There wasn't no leverage.

00:11:06.310 --> 00:11:08.030 align:middle line:90%
There was no gauges.

00:11:08.030 --> 00:11:08.830 align:middle line:90%
We know that.

00:11:08.830 --> 00:11:10.030 align:middle line:90%
We were in there.

00:11:10.030 --> 00:11:12.390 align:middle line:84%
There was no place where we
would have taken them off.

00:11:12.390 --> 00:11:13.480 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:11:13.480 --> 00:11:14.980 align:middle line:84%
If there had been
something that had

00:11:14.980 --> 00:11:16.990 align:middle line:84%
been a hole in
there or something--

00:11:16.990 --> 00:11:19.360 align:middle line:90%
there was nothing like that.

00:11:19.360 --> 00:11:20.830 align:middle line:90%
So how do they drive that?

00:11:20.830 --> 00:11:23.060 align:middle line:90%
What kind of a mechanism?

00:11:23.060 --> 00:11:27.400 align:middle line:84%
And so what some
of the opinions are

00:11:27.400 --> 00:11:32.030 align:middle line:84%
that these suits that
Corso talks about there

00:11:32.030 --> 00:11:34.130 align:middle line:90%
had circuits in them.

00:11:34.130 --> 00:11:36.800 align:middle line:84%
And they interfaced
with this, and this

00:11:36.800 --> 00:11:39.250 align:middle line:90%
interfaced with the ship.

00:11:39.250 --> 00:11:41.450 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:11:41.450 --> 00:11:44.960 align:middle line:84%
How do we know that this
material was just inside

00:11:44.960 --> 00:11:48.210 align:middle line:84%
and the outside was not
made of that same material?

00:11:48.210 --> 00:11:51.960 align:middle line:90%
Well, we know because of this.

00:11:51.960 --> 00:11:58.450 align:middle line:84%
This was found in our
time there, you know,

00:11:58.450 --> 00:12:01.288 align:middle line:90%
in the past 10 years.

00:12:01.288 --> 00:12:05.590 align:middle line:84%
>> Other evidence of the strange
characteristics of this metal

00:12:05.590 --> 00:12:09.190 align:middle line:84%
was found when a piece of metal
recovered at the accident site

00:12:09.190 --> 00:12:11.935 align:middle line:90%
was subjected to fire.

00:12:11.935 --> 00:12:17.110 align:middle line:84%
>> This was found embedded
in the Cholla cactus there

00:12:17.110 --> 00:12:20.800 align:middle line:90%
in the last 10 years as such.

00:12:20.800 --> 00:12:22.260 align:middle line:90%
And the cactus was dry.

00:12:22.260 --> 00:12:25.937 align:middle line:84%
So the cactus would have
been anywhere up to 100 years

00:12:25.937 --> 00:12:27.520 align:middle line:84%
because they lived
up to be 100 years.

00:12:27.520 --> 00:12:29.090 align:middle line:90%
And then they died and dried.

00:12:29.090 --> 00:12:32.440 align:middle line:90%
So it served its purpose.

00:12:32.440 --> 00:12:33.430 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:12:33.430 --> 00:12:40.480 align:middle line:90%
this is an outside piece.

00:12:40.480 --> 00:12:42.070 align:middle line:10%
And we believe it's
an outside piece

00:12:42.070 --> 00:12:50.110 align:middle line:10%
because when they put an
acetylene torch on this piece,

00:12:50.110 --> 00:12:55.790 align:middle line:10%
aluminum will melt at
550 to 700 degrees.

00:12:55.790 --> 00:12:57.700 align:middle line:90%
That's what it-- that's a known.

00:12:57.700 --> 00:13:00.100 align:middle line:90%
That's how it does.

00:13:00.100 --> 00:13:03.470 align:middle line:84%
They put a torch, and they
ran it up to 2000 degrees.

00:13:03.470 --> 00:13:05.080 align:middle line:90%
And what did you get?

00:13:05.080 --> 00:13:09.740 align:middle line:84%
It went through there, and it
melted out on the other side.

00:13:09.740 --> 00:13:12.550 align:middle line:10%
After the death of
Remigio Baca, the piece

00:13:12.550 --> 00:13:16.840 align:middle line:10%
extracted from the ship was sent
to Jose Padilla in New Mexico.

00:13:16.840 --> 00:13:20.080 align:middle line:84%
Mr. Padilla agreed to provide
us with a small sample

00:13:20.080 --> 00:13:22.195 align:middle line:90%
to carry out an analysis.

00:13:22.195 --> 00:13:26.670 align:middle line:84%
>> I'm going to cut this
a little piece off of here

00:13:26.670 --> 00:13:29.750 align:middle line:84%
and give it to you so
that you can have a test.

00:13:29.750 --> 00:13:34.500 align:middle line:84%
A piece that I wanted to keep
as a souvenir to let the people

00:13:34.500 --> 00:13:38.340 align:middle line:84%
know, you know, that I found
something that doesn't belong

00:13:38.340 --> 00:13:42.850 align:middle line:90%
to us, is not from this world.

00:13:42.850 --> 00:13:50.940 align:middle line:84%
But there is a lot of people
that think that I lie.

00:13:50.940 --> 00:13:56.420 align:middle line:84%
Even my older sister
thought that it a lie

00:13:56.420 --> 00:14:02.180 align:middle line:84%
and that it was impossible that
I took this thing out of there.

00:14:02.180 --> 00:14:06.210 align:middle line:84%
That's when I drove all the way
to California to the hospital

00:14:06.210 --> 00:14:07.340 align:middle line:90%
where she was.

00:14:07.340 --> 00:14:11.840 align:middle line:84%
And I asked her if she was
there, and she says, no.

00:14:11.840 --> 00:14:13.900 align:middle line:90%
Well, I was.

00:14:13.900 --> 00:14:16.700 align:middle line:90%
I experienced it, not her.

00:14:16.700 --> 00:14:18.258 align:middle line:90%
And that was it.

00:14:18.258 --> 00:14:19.550 align:middle line:90%
>> Your father never told them?

Apache Refuge.

00:14:34.670 --> 00:14:40.070 align:middle line:84%
And they didn't want
to spread anything

00:14:40.070 --> 00:14:45.200 align:middle line:84%
because of the military,
especially when my father and I

00:14:45.200 --> 00:14:47.560 align:middle line:84%
used to pick up a lot
of weather balloons

00:14:47.560 --> 00:14:50.880 align:middle line:90%
that belonged to the military.

00:14:50.880 --> 00:14:55.700 align:middle line:84%
And they thought that
that UFO was part of it.

00:14:55.700 --> 00:14:59.800 align:middle line:10%
But when this came out
there, they took an inventory

00:14:59.800 --> 00:15:02.910 align:middle line:10%
and loaded that
object on the trailer.

00:15:02.910 --> 00:15:06.820 align:middle line:84%
And someone went over
and took a part of.

00:15:06.820 --> 00:15:08.920 align:middle line:84%
When they got over
to the White Sands,

00:15:08.920 --> 00:15:11.230 align:middle line:84%
they took another
inventory list,

00:15:11.230 --> 00:15:13.990 align:middle line:90%
and a part of was missing.

00:15:13.990 --> 00:15:16.750 align:middle line:84%
That's when they sent
soldiers up there

00:15:16.750 --> 00:15:20.290 align:middle line:84%
to check and see what-- and
they came over to the ranch.

00:15:20.290 --> 00:15:22.270 align:middle line:90%
That's when I didn't get scared.

00:15:22.270 --> 00:15:24.490 align:middle line:90%
I never been scared of nobody.

00:15:24.490 --> 00:15:28.090 align:middle line:84%
That's where I took this part
from underneath the floor

00:15:28.090 --> 00:15:31.440 align:middle line:84%
on the ranch and took
it over to Reme's house.

>> Very hard?

00:15:32.760 --> 00:15:33.630 align:middle line:90%
>> No.

00:15:33.630 --> 00:15:34.430 align:middle line:90%
>> It's not--

00:15:34.430 --> 00:15:35.980 align:middle line:90%
>> It's hard.

00:15:35.980 --> 00:15:38.860 align:middle line:90%
But the only way that--

00:15:38.860 --> 00:15:43.390 align:middle line:84%
this will not melt. Because
I melt another piece,

00:15:43.390 --> 00:15:45.760 align:middle line:84%
and it doesn't melt
from the outside.

00:15:45.760 --> 00:15:47.790 align:middle line:90%
It bubbles from the inside out.

00:16:12.360 --> 00:16:15.426 align:middle line:90%
they were further analyzed.

00:16:15.426 --> 00:16:19.230 align:middle line:84%
>> Fluorescence analysis and
digital radio graphs were

00:16:19.230 --> 00:16:21.960 align:middle line:84%
performed to analyze
the chemical composition

00:16:21.960 --> 00:16:25.410 align:middle line:84%
of the metals and the internal
structure of the metals.

00:16:25.410 --> 00:16:28.770 align:middle line:84%
It was determined that they
correspond to two aluminum

00:16:28.770 --> 00:16:31.440 align:middle line:90%
alloys--

00:16:31.440 --> 00:16:42.870 align:middle line:84%
A332 and A380 that contain
88.71% aluminum, 6.97% silicon,

00:16:42.870 --> 00:16:54.440 align:middle line:84%
0.82% iron, 0.18% manganese,
0.19% nickel, 0.63% zinc,

00:16:54.440 --> 00:16:57.520 align:middle line:90%
and 0.04% tin.

00:16:57.520 --> 00:16:59.680 align:middle line:84%
Regarding the
digital radiographs,

00:16:59.680 --> 00:17:01.450 align:middle line:84%
it was observed that
these pieces were

00:17:01.450 --> 00:17:04.660 align:middle line:84%
very porous beyond
what's normal in a metal

00:17:04.660 --> 00:17:06.430 align:middle line:90%
with these characteristics.

00:17:06.430 --> 00:17:09.280 align:middle line:84%
It's not known if they could
be carbon nanotubes that

00:17:09.280 --> 00:17:12.670 align:middle line:84%
would help this metal stay
cold, despite the application

00:17:12.670 --> 00:17:14.800 align:middle line:90%
of high intensity heat.

00:17:14.800 --> 00:17:17.800 align:middle line:84%
Aluminum is the most
abundant metal on Earth.

00:17:17.800 --> 00:17:20.599 align:middle line:90%


00:17:20.599 --> 00:17:23.780 align:middle line:10%
8% of our planet
contains aluminum.

00:17:23.780 --> 00:17:26.000 align:middle line:84%
It was discovered
in 1820, but it

00:17:26.000 --> 00:17:28.580 align:middle line:84%
wasn't until the end
of the 19th century

00:17:28.580 --> 00:17:32.610 align:middle line:84%
that an accessible method
of extraction was developed.

00:17:32.610 --> 00:17:36.230 align:middle line:84%
The name of alumin was
used by [INAUDIBLE]..

00:17:36.230 --> 00:17:41.490 align:middle line:84%
But it wasn't until 1722 that
it was considered a metal.

00:17:41.490 --> 00:17:48.330 align:middle line:84%
During the First World War, 5%
of all metals were aluminum.

00:17:48.330 --> 00:17:52.880 align:middle line:84%
In World War II,
aluminum was widely used.

00:17:52.880 --> 00:17:55.460 align:middle line:84%
In 1941, the first
tests were carried out

00:17:55.460 --> 00:17:58.970 align:middle line:84%
to create an aluminum
alloy combined

00:17:58.970 --> 00:18:03.230 align:middle line:84%
with magnesium by the Canadian
scientist Lloyd Montgomery

00:18:03.230 --> 00:18:05.630 align:middle line:90%
Pidgeon.

00:18:05.630 --> 00:18:07.640 align:middle line:84%
It wasn't until
the end of the '40s

00:18:07.640 --> 00:18:11.900 align:middle line:84%
that more emphasis was
placed on aluminum alloys.

00:18:11.900 --> 00:18:14.720 align:middle line:10%
And then in the '50s,
more sophisticated alloys

00:18:14.720 --> 00:18:16.680 align:middle line:10%
would be developed.

00:18:16.680 --> 00:18:21.830 align:middle line:10%
However, in 1945 when Jose
Padilla and Reme Baca, who

00:18:21.830 --> 00:18:23.870 align:middle line:10%
claimed to have extracted
the piece of metal

00:18:23.870 --> 00:18:26.690 align:middle line:10%
from the alien ship,
this type of alloy

00:18:26.690 --> 00:18:29.620 align:middle line:10%
had not even been
developed or invented yet.

00:18:29.620 --> 00:18:32.960 align:middle line:90%


00:18:32.960 --> 00:18:35.180 align:middle line:10%
No historical reference
has been found

00:18:35.180 --> 00:18:38.480 align:middle line:10%
that demonstrates that such
metal compounds existed

00:18:38.480 --> 00:18:40.340 align:middle line:10%
at that time.

00:18:40.340 --> 00:18:43.370 align:middle line:84%
Today, the aluminum
alloy is common.

00:18:43.370 --> 00:18:47.380 align:middle line:10%
But in August 1945,
it was unknown.

00:18:47.380 --> 00:18:50.560 align:middle line:10%
If the authenticity of
the dates is confirmed,

00:18:50.560 --> 00:18:53.560 align:middle line:10%
it could also be established
that the first alien ship

00:18:53.560 --> 00:18:55.960 align:middle line:10%
discovery could have
served to assist

00:18:55.960 --> 00:18:59.800 align:middle line:10%
our scientists to develop
more sophisticated alloys

00:18:59.800 --> 00:19:02.560 align:middle line:10%
and thus improve production
practices for aluminum

00:19:02.560 --> 00:19:06.280 align:middle line:10%
technologies that would
be used in the future.

00:19:06.280 --> 00:19:10.060 align:middle line:84%
The images obtained in England
with an electron microscope

00:19:10.060 --> 00:19:12.160 align:middle line:84%
demonstrate the
presence of what appears

00:19:12.160 --> 00:19:15.430 align:middle line:84%
to be electronic circuits
similar to the circuits

00:19:15.430 --> 00:19:17.830 align:middle line:90%
of today's modern computers.

00:19:17.830 --> 00:19:20.650 align:middle line:84%
Even more surprising
was the analysis

00:19:20.650 --> 00:19:23.320 align:middle line:84%
carried out by the
Analytical Educational Center

00:19:23.320 --> 00:19:24.760 align:middle line:90%
in Mexico City.

00:19:24.760 --> 00:19:29.590 align:middle line:84%
The analysis was performed by
a Thermo Scientific iCE 3000

00:19:29.590 --> 00:19:32.230 align:middle line:90%
Atomic Absorption Spectrometer.

00:19:32.230 --> 00:19:35.650 align:middle line:84%
The examination results
confirmed an alloy

00:19:35.650 --> 00:19:37.420 align:middle line:90%
based on aluminum.

00:19:37.420 --> 00:19:41.540 align:middle line:10%
It was even identified
as an alloy of duralumin.

00:19:41.540 --> 00:19:44.500 align:middle line:10%
However, 15% of the
compounds were not

00:19:44.500 --> 00:19:47.980 align:middle line:10%
identified, very
possibly because they

00:19:47.980 --> 00:19:51.160 align:middle line:10%
are non-organic materials.

00:19:51.160 --> 00:19:56.410 align:middle line:84%
The chemist that performed the
analysis was Maria [INAUDIBLE]..

00:19:56.410 --> 00:19:59.920 align:middle line:84%
We were able to interview Maria
and get a better understanding

00:19:59.920 --> 00:20:01.000 align:middle line:90%
of what she found.

00:20:03.740 --> 00:20:07.390 align:middle line:84%

if it is indeed an
organic material

INTERPRETER: Well, steel
itself is an alloy with carbon.

00:20:45.520 --> 00:20:47.230 align:middle line:90%
That's quite common.

00:20:47.230 --> 00:20:51.340 align:middle line:84%
But the types of alloys in
this material with aluminum

00:20:51.340 --> 00:20:52.930 align:middle line:90%
are not common.

00:20:52.930 --> 00:20:55.600 align:middle line:90%
For example, we have duralumin.

00:20:55.600 --> 00:20:58.630 align:middle line:84%
That complies with the
proportions of the material

00:20:58.630 --> 00:21:00.010 align:middle line:90%
that we analyzed.

00:21:00.010 --> 00:21:02.720 align:middle line:84%
But this material's
components are well known.

00:21:02.720 --> 00:21:06.780 align:middle line:84%

any organic component.

it is an unconventional
finding that

00:21:22.350 --> 00:21:24.750 align:middle line:10%

INTERPRETER: Well, in all
analytical measurement

00:21:42.160 --> 00:21:45.280 align:middle line:84%
techniques, there is
a margin of error.

00:21:45.280 --> 00:21:49.350 align:middle line:84%
That margin of error depends
a lot on the technique used.

00:21:49.350 --> 00:21:52.660 align:middle line:84%
In the case of atomic
fusion, the margin

00:21:52.660 --> 00:21:57.660 align:middle line:84%
can be 5.5% and even
parts per million.

00:21:57.660 --> 00:22:02.470 align:middle line:84%
But a percentage of 15% is
very high for this material

00:22:02.470 --> 00:22:06.330 align:middle line:84%
because current analytical
techniques have advanced a lot.

00:22:06.330 --> 00:22:10.270 align:middle line:84%

good technology, which allows

it to reach quite low levels.

considerable amount that

until I find the final function
of each of these elements.

00:23:44.720 --> 00:23:47.990 align:middle line:84%
Because each of the elements
that the alloy contains

00:23:47.990 --> 00:23:49.400 align:middle line:90%
has a function.

00:23:49.400 --> 00:23:51.320 align:middle line:84%
For example, zinc
has the function

00:23:51.320 --> 00:23:53.240 align:middle line:90%
of preventing corruption.

00:23:53.240 --> 00:23:56.840 align:middle line:84%
Aluminum is a metal that
oxidizes very easily.

00:23:56.840 --> 00:24:00.170 align:middle line:84%
And combining it with
magnesium and manganese it

00:24:00.170 --> 00:24:03.170 align:middle line:84%
has the function of
giving greater resistance

to oxidation.

00:24:05.090 --> 00:24:08.270 align:middle line:84%
On the other hand, iron
adds hardness to the metal

00:24:08.270 --> 00:24:11.600 align:middle line:84%
because aluminum is very
malleable and breaks easily.

00:24:11.600 --> 00:24:14.790 align:middle line:84%
So iron gives it a
mechanical resistance.

00:24:14.790 --> 00:24:17.810 align:middle line:84%
However, there is no
concoction of this type that

00:24:17.810 --> 00:24:20.220 align:middle line:90%

A case that has remained
unknown to most people--

00:24:49.700 --> 00:24:52.430 align:middle line:84%
why would researchers
dismiss the findings

00:24:52.430 --> 00:24:56.460 align:middle line:84%
without even having
investigated the findings?

00:24:56.460 --> 00:24:58.970 align:middle line:84%
This would have been the
first case of a UFO recovered

00:24:58.970 --> 00:25:02.510 align:middle line:84%
by the US government, the
first of three foreign objects

00:25:02.510 --> 00:25:04.610 align:middle line:84%
recovered around
the Los Alamos plant

00:25:04.610 --> 00:25:08.090 align:middle line:84%
in New Mexico, the only
area that designed and built

00:25:08.090 --> 00:25:10.460 align:middle line:90%
atomic bombs at that time.

00:25:10.460 --> 00:25:12.620 align:middle line:84%
Later, two more ships
would crash land

00:25:12.620 --> 00:25:15.260 align:middle line:84%
in Roswell and
Austin, New Mexico.

00:25:15.260 --> 00:25:17.720 align:middle line:84%
We discovered that those
crashes very possibly

00:25:17.720 --> 00:25:20.570 align:middle line:84%
were a result of
powerful radars.

00:25:20.570 --> 00:25:23.120 align:middle line:10%
We will prove that
hypothesis in future

00:25:23.120 --> 00:25:27.170 align:middle line:10%
shows as this investigation
continues to unfold.

00:25:27.170 --> 00:25:30.620 align:middle line:10%
You will see the memo that Guy
Hotell addressed to J. Edgar

00:25:30.620 --> 00:25:33.800 align:middle line:10%
Hoover, informing him of
three ships that crashed

00:25:33.800 --> 00:25:42.540 align:middle line:10%
into Mexico in the 1940s.
