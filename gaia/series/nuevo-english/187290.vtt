"No," I said to Giuseppe,
"they are too perfect.

00:18:01.440 --> 00:18:03.270 align:middle line:90%
I think they're false.

00:18:03.270 --> 00:18:04.980 align:middle line:84%
Are you sure that

00:18:10.580 --> 00:18:13.230 align:middle line:84%

"No, I'm an analyst

Something else that
surprised me was

00:18:35.370 --> 00:18:39.030 align:middle line:84%
to learn that Antonio
was a fashion designer.

00:18:39.030 --> 00:18:42.180 align:middle line:84%

For me, one of the

00:20:10.890 --> 00:20:12.660 align:middle line:90%
surprising cases.

00:20:12.660 --> 00:20:16.920 align:middle line:84%
But once we have proof, once the
investigations have been made,

00:20:16.920 --> 00:20:20.610 align:middle line:84%
why continue to doubt and
attack and place at risk

00:20:20.610 --> 00:20:22.920 align:middle line:90%
the safety of the person?

00:20:22.920 --> 00:20:25.870 align:middle line:84%
It does not make sense,
because at this moment

00:20:25.870 --> 00:20:29.070 align:middle line:84%
I have proof that
the case is valid.

00:20:29.070 --> 00:20:33.060 align:middle line:84%
We have demonstrated this
using the latest technology.

00:20:33.060 --> 00:20:37.080 align:middle line:84%
In a world as violent and
complicated as the one

00:20:37.080 --> 00:20:41.400 align:middle line:84%
we live, why have those
beings not declared war on us

00:20:41.400 --> 00:20:44.340 align:middle line:90%
in all of these years?

00:20:44.340 --> 00:20:47.550 align:middle line:84%
Maybe this is a
hope for humanity.

00:20:47.550 --> 00:20:50.260 align:middle line:90%


00:20:50.260 --> 00:20:54.340 align:middle line:84%
>> This case represents hope for
humanity because it shows that

00:20:54.340 --> 00:20:57.880 align:middle line:84%
the phenomenon is real,
that it is not dangerous,

00:20:57.880 --> 00:21:01.630 align:middle line:84%
that these beings are here, and
that their actions show that

00:21:01.630 --> 00:21:04.960 align:middle line:84%
they want to have contact
with human beings.

00:21:04.960 --> 00:21:09.760 align:middle line:84%
Giorgio Bongiovanni represents
a vital part in Antonio's life,

00:21:09.760 --> 00:21:13.150 align:middle line:84%
not only because he announces
crucial events in advance,

00:21:13.150 --> 00:21:17.810 align:middle line:84%
but because he has established
himself as a guide for Antonio.

00:21:17.810 --> 00:21:21.380 align:middle line:84%
Bongiovanni lives with his
own physical body experience,

00:21:21.380 --> 00:21:24.190 align:middle line:90%
which is extraordinary.

00:21:24.190 --> 00:21:26.440 align:middle line:84%
He reveals on his
hands and on his feet

00:21:26.440 --> 00:21:28.490 align:middle line:90%
the stigmata of Christ.

00:21:28.490 --> 00:21:31.000 align:middle line:84%
He has been analyzed by
different specialists, who

00:21:31.000 --> 00:21:34.360 align:middle line:84%
have concluded that this
case is inexplicable.

00:21:34.360 --> 00:21:36.820 align:middle line:84%
Even blood that
emanates from the wounds

00:21:36.820 --> 00:21:40.000 align:middle line:84%
not only clots instantly,
but sometimes emits

00:21:40.000 --> 00:21:41.950 align:middle line:90%
an intense smell of flowers.

00:21:41.950 --> 00:21:47.610 align:middle line:90%


00:21:47.610 --> 00:21:54.900 align:middle line:84%
>> We met for the first time in
2005 at a conference in Milan.

00:21:54.900 --> 00:21:59.850 align:middle line:84%
Antonio told me that I
have a lot of videos.

00:21:59.850 --> 00:22:02.030 align:middle line:84%
I would like to
show them to you.

00:22:02.030 --> 00:22:04.650 align:middle line:90%


00:22:04.650 --> 00:22:12.030 align:middle line:84%
Of course, at first I was
very cautious and respectful.

00:22:12.030 --> 00:22:16.740 align:middle line:90%
I said to him, let's see them.

00:22:16.740 --> 00:22:20.610 align:middle line:10%
By that time, we
already had thousands

00:22:20.610 --> 00:22:27.000 align:middle line:10%
of videos of UFOs, which were
being sent to us by many people

00:22:27.000 --> 00:22:29.790 align:middle line:10%
from different places.

00:22:29.790 --> 00:22:35.220 align:middle line:10%
Antonio and Simona, who
was then his girlfriend,

00:22:35.220 --> 00:22:42.660 align:middle line:10%
caught my attention because they
had something extraordinary.

00:22:42.660 --> 00:22:46.680 align:middle line:90%
They exuded great energy.

00:22:46.680 --> 00:22:54.310 align:middle line:84%
When we saw the videos of
Urzi, it was a revelation.

00:22:54.310 --> 00:22:59.580 align:middle line:84%
We were all amazed, as they
showed UFOs as we had never

00:22:59.580 --> 00:23:02.250 align:middle line:90%
seen them before.

00:23:02.250 --> 00:23:06.630 align:middle line:84%
So we started with
the investigation.

00:23:06.630 --> 00:23:11.190 align:middle line:84%
I'm not a researcher, so I
gave those videos to you,

00:23:11.190 --> 00:23:17.820 align:middle line:84%
my good friend Jaime Maussan,
as well as other researchers.

00:23:17.820 --> 00:23:19.860 align:middle line:90%
They are shocking.

00:23:19.860 --> 00:23:25.140 align:middle line:84%
We had to resolve the doubt
of knowing if they were fake.

00:23:25.140 --> 00:23:28.240 align:middle line:84%
Thank God they are
the real thing.

00:23:28.240 --> 00:23:31.520 align:middle line:90%


00:23:31.520 --> 00:23:35.700 align:middle line:84%
For me, the importance
of Antonio's videos

00:23:35.700 --> 00:23:38.700 align:middle line:90%
is not for this era.

00:23:38.700 --> 00:23:44.520 align:middle line:84%
For now, they serve to awaken
the curiosity of UFO fans

00:23:44.520 --> 00:23:49.350 align:middle line:84%
and to share with those who are
passionate about spirituality

00:23:49.350 --> 00:23:53.060 align:middle line:84%
and about the presence
of extraterrestrials.

00:23:53.060 --> 00:24:01.610 align:middle line:90%


00:24:01.610 --> 00:24:04.880 align:middle line:84%
The number of these
people is considerable.

00:24:04.880 --> 00:24:07.190 align:middle line:90%
I think we are in the millions.

00:24:07.190 --> 00:24:13.490 align:middle line:84%
And I include myself with them
because I am also a believer.

00:24:13.490 --> 00:24:19.550 align:middle line:84%
I support the in-depth and
positive investigations.

00:24:19.550 --> 00:24:25.020 align:middle line:10%
For me, the extensive contact
revealed by Antonio Urzi

00:24:25.020 --> 00:24:28.310 align:middle line:10%
is to prepare us
for real contact.

00:24:28.310 --> 00:24:31.370 align:middle line:84%
I feel we know
through inspiration

00:24:31.370 --> 00:24:35.870 align:middle line:84%
that Antonio is one of those
people along with others

00:24:35.870 --> 00:24:40.310 align:middle line:84%
in the world who are going
to film a massive contact

00:24:40.310 --> 00:24:42.560 align:middle line:90%
with the aliens.

00:24:42.560 --> 00:24:46.460 align:middle line:84%
Then all of humanity
will listen.

00:24:46.460 --> 00:24:49.910 align:middle line:84%
As I said, it's
not just Antonio.

00:24:49.910 --> 00:24:54.380 align:middle line:84%
There are other people on
basically every continent just

00:24:54.380 --> 00:25:01.040 align:middle line:84%
like our Antonio Urzi who
will all film the aliens

00:25:01.040 --> 00:25:05.540 align:middle line:84%
and thus open the doors
to a massive communication

00:25:05.540 --> 00:25:07.220 align:middle line:90%
with all humanity.

00:25:07.220 --> 00:25:11.560 align:middle line:90%


00:25:11.560 --> 00:25:14.560 align:middle line:84%
>> How is it possible that this
man knows when there will be

00:25:14.560 --> 00:25:20.790 align:middle line:84%
an important sighting, like
the one on April 17, 2018?

00:25:20.790 --> 00:25:24.420 align:middle line:84%
>> I have had a
spiritual inspiration.

00:25:24.420 --> 00:25:29.460 align:middle line:84%
My contact is not
physical, but spiritual.

00:25:29.460 --> 00:25:33.070 align:middle line:90%
These beings are angels.

00:25:33.070 --> 00:25:36.510 align:middle line:84%
In the last event
in particular, I

00:25:36.510 --> 00:25:41.820 align:middle line:84%
called Antonio and
said, "Go now and wait

00:25:41.820 --> 00:25:45.480 align:middle line:90%
because a huge UFO is coming."

00:25:45.480 --> 00:25:47.840 align:middle line:90%
That is how it happened.

00:25:47.840 --> 00:25:52.160 align:middle line:84%
>> However with Antonio's
case so clear and so powerful,

00:25:52.160 --> 00:25:54.650 align:middle line:84%
why is it that humanity
has not reacted?

00:25:54.650 --> 00:25:57.710 align:middle line:90%


00:25:57.710 --> 00:26:05.060 align:middle line:10%
>> You are afraid of the new,
the unknown, of the beautiful.

00:26:05.060 --> 00:26:08.990 align:middle line:10%
If we continue thinking
only about the past,

00:26:08.990 --> 00:26:13.370 align:middle line:10%
we are just holding
on to old ideas.

00:26:13.370 --> 00:26:19.040 align:middle line:84%
I am not saying that these
are wrong, just outdated,

00:26:19.040 --> 00:26:23.240 align:middle line:90%
old-fashioned, and obsolete.

00:26:23.240 --> 00:26:27.320 align:middle line:84%
We are afraid that a
man like Antonio Urzi

00:26:27.320 --> 00:26:33.690 align:middle line:84%
can change my life of
materialism, of selfishness.

00:26:33.690 --> 00:26:37.060 align:middle line:84%
It has always been
my way of thinking,

00:26:37.060 --> 00:26:41.210 align:middle line:90%
and now I have to change.

00:26:41.210 --> 00:26:44.420 align:middle line:84%
I believe and there
is evidence that there

00:26:44.420 --> 00:26:48.500 align:middle line:84%
is a persecution
against those who think

00:26:48.500 --> 00:26:52.760 align:middle line:90%
that Antonio is a contact.

00:26:52.760 --> 00:26:59.630 align:middle line:84%
His mission is not to send
messages but to be a contact,

00:26:59.630 --> 00:27:04.040 align:middle line:84%
because those
beings pose for him.

00:27:04.040 --> 00:27:08.810 align:middle line:84%
Antonio does not record UFOs
because he suddenly sees

00:27:08.810 --> 00:27:11.990 align:middle line:90%
them walking through a plaza.

00:27:11.990 --> 00:27:19.530 align:middle line:84%
On the contrary, these beings
seek him, move in front of him.

00:27:19.530 --> 00:27:23.370 align:middle line:84%
So at least he has a
telepathic contact.

00:27:23.370 --> 00:27:26.360 align:middle line:90%


00:27:26.360 --> 00:27:33.100 align:middle line:84%
So far I do not know if
Antonio sends messages.

00:27:33.100 --> 00:27:36.920 align:middle line:84%
If you would allow me
to share my opinion,

00:27:36.920 --> 00:27:42.440 align:middle line:84%
I don't think he does,
because writing messages is

00:27:42.440 --> 00:27:47.610 align:middle line:84%
very complicated and can cause
a very difficult dynamic.

00:27:47.610 --> 00:27:51.280 align:middle line:84%
I'm not saying that one
day he will do this,

00:27:51.280 --> 00:27:54.860 align:middle line:84%
but I think that at
this moment the contact

00:27:54.860 --> 00:27:58.670 align:middle line:84%
is very coherent with
the current method.

00:27:58.670 --> 00:28:01.160 align:middle line:90%
This relationship is not casual.

00:28:01.160 --> 00:28:05.240 align:middle line:84%
These beings are
communicating with Antonio.

00:28:05.240 --> 00:28:10.670 align:middle line:84%
They are interested in spreading
a peaceful, spiritual, positive

00:28:10.670 --> 00:28:15.230 align:middle line:90%
message of love and brotherhood.

00:28:15.230 --> 00:28:19.520 align:middle line:84%
I have insisted with
Antonio, be very careful,

00:28:19.520 --> 00:28:21.410 align:middle line:84%
and do not get
involved in matters

00:28:21.410 --> 00:28:26.180 align:middle line:84%
of money and materialism,
because he would lose contact,

00:28:26.180 --> 00:28:29.090 align:middle line:90%
as has happened to many others.

00:28:29.090 --> 00:28:33.050 align:middle line:84%
I think I know all or
most of the contact that

00:28:33.050 --> 00:28:38.360 align:middle line:84%
exists historically, having
read or met them personally.

00:28:38.360 --> 00:28:40.970 align:middle line:84%
I think that Antonio's
is the most coherent

00:28:40.970 --> 00:28:45.260 align:middle line:90%
of all up to this moment.

00:28:45.260 --> 00:28:49.580 align:middle line:84%
Others, like the case
of [INAUDIBLE],, Adamski,

00:28:49.580 --> 00:28:52.700 align:middle line:84%
and Siragusa, I
consider them to be

00:28:52.700 --> 00:28:55.610 align:middle line:84%
of a significant
spiritual level.

00:28:55.610 --> 00:29:04.370 align:middle line:84%
Those three, they have
always offered proof.

00:29:04.370 --> 00:29:10.730 align:middle line:10%
>> On January 4, 2017, Antonio
recorded a kind of energy ring.

00:29:10.730 --> 00:29:14.610 align:middle line:10%
It moved at a constant
speed at a high altitude.

00:29:14.610 --> 00:29:19.570 align:middle line:84%
The scene was filmed with
the 2,200-millimeter lens.

00:29:19.570 --> 00:29:23.210 align:middle line:84%
Shortly before concluding this
stage of our investigation,

00:29:23.210 --> 00:29:26.110 align:middle line:84%
Antonio shot two
other incredible views

00:29:26.110 --> 00:29:27.790 align:middle line:84%
of the extraterrestrial
presence.

00:29:27.790 --> 00:29:32.840 align:middle line:90%


00:29:32.840 --> 00:29:35.150 align:middle line:84%
The first one, after
not having recorded

00:29:35.150 --> 00:29:41.300 align:middle line:84%
a similar ship in three years,
happened on April 17, 2018.

00:29:41.300 --> 00:29:44.090 align:middle line:84%
Giorgio Bongiovanni had
warned him in advance

00:29:44.090 --> 00:29:49.080 align:middle line:84%
that a gold UFO was
going to appear.

00:29:49.080 --> 00:29:51.840 align:middle line:84%
In the film, you can
hear the singing of birds

00:29:51.840 --> 00:29:55.290 align:middle line:84%
where Antonio has captured
the scene from a park.

00:29:55.290 --> 00:29:58.830 align:middle line:84%
We hear Antonio call a guard
to witness the sighting.

00:29:58.830 --> 00:30:01.950 align:middle line:84%
He also mentions that Giorgio
Bongiovanni had told him

00:30:01.950 --> 00:30:06.660 align:middle line:84%
beforehand that you will see the
son's reflections on the ship.

00:30:06.660 --> 00:30:09.150 align:middle line:90%
A truly extraordinary video.

00:30:09.150 --> 00:30:12.531 align:middle line:90%
[BIRDS CHIRPING]

00:30:12.531 --> 00:30:17.860 align:middle line:90%


00:30:17.860 --> 00:30:18.782 align:middle line:90%
>> Ciao.

00:30:18.782 --> 00:30:21.680 align:middle line:90%


00:30:21.680 --> 00:30:24.100 align:middle line:90%
Bellissimo.

00:30:24.100 --> 00:30:24.900 align:middle line:90%
Bello.

00:30:24.900 --> 00:30:45.430 align:middle line:90%


00:30:45.430 --> 00:30:49.540 align:middle line:84%
>> On June 10, 2018 in the
company of the group called

00:30:49.540 --> 00:30:54.610 align:middle line:84%
Mass Contact, Antonio was able
to videorecord an extraordinary

00:30:54.610 --> 00:30:58.600 align:middle line:84%
body with three or four bright
objects that rotated at high

00:30:58.600 --> 00:31:00.520 align:middle line:90%
speed inside.

00:31:00.520 --> 00:31:04.720 align:middle line:84%
To shoot these images, he used
the 2,200-millimeter Samyang

00:31:04.720 --> 00:31:05.860 align:middle line:90%
lens.

00:31:05.860 --> 00:31:08.410 align:middle line:84%
We can clearly
see and appreciate

00:31:08.410 --> 00:31:12.345 align:middle line:84%
the details of this object
or form of energy in the sky.

00:31:12.345 --> 00:31:18.580 align:middle line:90%


00:31:18.580 --> 00:31:22.450 align:middle line:10%
>> Four years ago, I formed
a group called Mass Contact.

00:31:22.450 --> 00:31:26.350 align:middle line:10%
More than 70 people meet with
me in the park, in the garden,

00:31:26.350 --> 00:31:28.915 align:middle line:10%
to observe the UFOs
for two or three hours.

00:31:28.915 --> 00:31:31.600 align:middle line:90%


00:31:31.600 --> 00:31:33.790 align:middle line:84%
Many people passing
by laugh at us

00:31:33.790 --> 00:31:38.830 align:middle line:84%
when they see us with the
cameras and all our equipment.

00:31:38.830 --> 00:31:43.450 align:middle line:84%
To them, the attraction is not
the objects in the sky, but us.

00:31:43.450 --> 00:31:46.990 align:middle line:90%
Don't you think it's absurd?

00:31:46.990 --> 00:31:48.760 align:middle line:84%
It's a sample of the
intellectual level

00:31:48.760 --> 00:31:50.870 align:middle line:90%
of many people in the world.

00:31:50.870 --> 00:31:55.340 align:middle line:84%
It's not really their fault.
We don't feel offended.

00:31:55.340 --> 00:31:56.230 align:middle line:90%
We understand them.

00:31:56.230 --> 00:31:59.290 align:middle line:90%


00:31:59.290 --> 00:32:01.240 align:middle line:84%
That's the way it's
always been until now.

00:32:01.240 --> 00:32:04.420 align:middle line:90%


00:32:04.420 --> 00:32:06.310 align:middle line:84%
Today I am more
aware than before.

00:32:06.310 --> 00:32:09.610 align:middle line:90%


00:32:09.610 --> 00:32:11.680 align:middle line:84%
The difference is
that in the past,

00:32:11.680 --> 00:32:14.670 align:middle line:84%
I was not sure of what was
happening to me, the events

00:32:14.670 --> 00:32:15.470 align:middle line:90%
that I saw.

00:32:15.470 --> 00:32:19.630 align:middle line:90%


00:32:19.630 --> 00:32:21.970 align:middle line:84%
Now it's different because
I have the certainty

00:32:21.970 --> 00:32:22.960 align:middle line:90%
that I am a contact.

00:32:22.960 --> 00:32:27.430 align:middle line:90%


00:32:27.430 --> 00:32:30.250 align:middle line:84%
Like having a cell
phone, I dial the number,

00:32:30.250 --> 00:32:31.800 align:middle line:90%
and I hope they answer the call.

00:32:31.800 --> 00:32:36.660 align:middle line:90%


00:32:36.660 --> 00:32:40.870 align:middle line:84%
So I make my contacts,
I concentrate,

00:32:40.870 --> 00:32:44.200 align:middle line:84%
I clear my mind of any
problem, and I establish

00:32:44.200 --> 00:32:46.450 align:middle line:90%
this special communication.

00:32:46.450 --> 00:32:51.690 align:middle line:90%


00:32:51.690 --> 00:32:54.990 align:middle line:84%
>> All the videos and
photographs of Antonio Urzi are

00:32:54.990 --> 00:32:58.830 align:middle line:84%
available to professional
researchers who maintain

00:32:58.830 --> 00:33:00.690 align:middle line:90%
an objective attitude.

00:33:00.690 --> 00:33:03.960 align:middle line:84%
It is without a doubt
an authentic case

00:33:03.960 --> 00:33:05.850 align:middle line:90%
like no other in the world--

00:33:05.850 --> 00:33:10.210 align:middle line:84%
a situation that is still
active and is happening today

00:33:10.210 --> 00:33:13.500 align:middle line:84%
and that could be the
beginning of a true contact

00:33:13.500 --> 00:33:15.840 align:middle line:90%
with other intelligences.

00:33:15.840 --> 00:33:18.300 align:middle line:84%
