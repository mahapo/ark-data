00:09:27.910 --> 00:09:31.330 align:middle line:10%
when the UFOs activity
became much more active.

00:09:31.330 --> 00:09:33.700 align:middle line:90%
And it was happening every day.

00:09:33.700 --> 00:09:37.810 align:middle line:84%
Each day, there was a different
surprise or manifestation.

00:09:37.810 --> 00:09:41.020 align:middle line:84%
This gave me the opportunity to
capture all the transformations

00:10:20.100 --> 00:10:25.000 align:middle line:84%
The authorities in Italy
must share what is happening.

00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:28.150 align:middle line:84%
We certainly need to spread
this information openly, as well

as the recorded
activity that exists.

00:10:31.900 --> 00:10:34.480 align:middle line:84%

if no one in Italy shares this
information about the UFOs?

00:10:39.010 --> 00:10:42.480 align:middle line:84%
That's why the information
we have goes unnoticed.

a truly extraordinary story.

00:14:37.346 --> 00:14:42.998 align:middle line:10%
A young designer, 33 year old,
Antonio Urzi, who, as a child,

00:14:42.998 --> 00:14:45.040 align:middle line:10%
began to observe unidentified
flying objects that

00:14:45.040 --> 00:14:46.240 align:middle line:10%
seemed to approach him.

00:14:46.240 --> 00:14:49.000 align:middle line:10%


00:14:49.000 --> 00:14:51.930 align:middle line:10%
His family and his
friends did not

00:14:51.930 --> 00:14:54.630 align:middle line:10%
believe him, until they
also became witnesses.

00:14:54.630 --> 00:14:56.660 align:middle line:10%


00:14:56.660 --> 00:15:00.005 align:middle line:10%
And soon he began to video
record his first objects.

00:15:00.005 --> 00:15:02.570 align:middle line:10%
And soon he began to video
record his first objects.

00:15:02.570 --> 00:15:09.640 align:middle line:90%


00:15:09.640 --> 00:15:11.970 align:middle line:10%
This strange

00:15:19.110 --> 00:15:21.830 align:middle line:10%
As time has passed, Antonio
has been able to record,

00:15:21.830 --> 00:15:24.140 align:middle line:10%
in a clearer and closer
way, these objects.

00:15:24.140 --> 00:15:27.090 align:middle line:10%


00:15:27.090 --> 00:15:29.960 align:middle line:10%
Since 2004, they seemed
to approach his home,

00:15:29.960 --> 00:15:38.480 align:middle line:10%
here, in Milan, where, from
his windows in the attic,

00:15:38.480 --> 00:15:40.425 align:middle line:10%
he could record
beautiful images,

00:15:40.425 --> 00:15:44.500 align:middle line:10%
as rarely seen in the
history of this phenomenon.

00:15:44.500 --> 00:15:46.190 align:middle line:90%
It is genuinely extraordinary.

00:15:46.190 --> 00:15:48.260 align:middle line:90%


00:15:48.260 --> 00:15:49.820 align:middle line:10%
These are some of the best.

00:15:49.820 --> 00:15:52.650 align:middle line:10%
This attracted our
attention since 2006,

00:15:52.650 --> 00:15:54.660 align:middle line:10%
when we began our
relationship and research

00:15:54.660 --> 00:15:55.950 align:middle line:10%
in this unique case.

00:15:55.950 --> 00:15:58.420 align:middle line:10%


00:15:58.420 --> 00:16:01.640 align:middle line:10%
Soon we saw the
video of a horse that

00:16:01.640 --> 00:16:04.200 align:middle line:10%
had been videotaped in the sky.

00:16:04.200 --> 00:16:06.170 align:middle line:10%
And the critics started.

00:16:06.170 --> 00:16:07.500 align:middle line:10%
Some said it was a balloon.

00:16:07.500 --> 00:16:08.990 align:middle line:10%


00:16:08.990 --> 00:16:11.180 align:middle line:10%
We did the tests and it
should that it was not that.

00:16:11.180 --> 00:16:13.820 align:middle line:10%


00:16:13.820 --> 00:16:16.070 align:middle line:10%
In fact, in the Vatican,
we found a fresco

00:16:16.070 --> 00:16:21.890 align:middle line:10%
with an image of a horse that
reflect a previous event, which

00:16:21.890 --> 00:16:23.750 align:middle line:10%
was recorded in
the 16th century.

00:16:23.750 --> 00:16:26.345 align:middle line:10%


00:16:26.345 --> 00:16:27.970 align:middle line:10%
Then, in December
2006, he would record

00:16:27.970 --> 00:16:30.820 align:middle line:10%
what seems to be the image of
a virgin floating in the sky.

00:16:30.820 --> 00:16:35.132 align:middle line:90%


00:16:35.132 --> 00:16:36.965 align:middle line:10%
A sizable, remarkable
object came very close

00:16:36.965 --> 00:16:46.020 align:middle line:10%
and was captured with
a new video camera,

00:16:46.020 --> 00:16:48.663 align:middle line:10%
given to him by
Giorgio Giorgiobanni.

00:16:48.663 --> 00:16:51.350 align:middle line:10%
Antonio was able to take
this incredible image.

00:16:51.350 --> 00:16:52.980 align:middle line:10%
Then there would be others.

00:16:52.980 --> 00:16:56.450 align:middle line:10%
On March 12, 2008,
again, a nearby

00:16:56.450 --> 00:16:58.910 align:middle line:10%
object that seems to
dance before his camera.

00:16:58.910 --> 00:17:01.370 align:middle line:10%
Something unique,
never seen before.

00:17:01.370 --> 00:17:03.500 align:middle line:10%


00:17:03.500 --> 00:17:07.668 align:middle line:10%
And finally, on August
26, 2008, the same device

00:17:07.668 --> 00:17:09.460 align:middle line:10%
that we had already
seen on other occasions

00:17:09.460 --> 00:17:14.780 align:middle line:10%
appeared one more time.

00:17:14.780 --> 00:17:17.569 align:middle line:10%
And was now closer than ever.

00:17:17.569 --> 00:17:19.900 align:middle line:10%
It is evident that
this young person lives

00:17:19.900 --> 00:17:21.947 align:middle line:10%
an extraordinary situation.

00:17:21.947 --> 00:17:23.655 align:middle line:10%
The objects approach
his camera, allowing

00:17:23.655 --> 00:17:25.880 align:middle line:10%
him to record them and
share with the world

00:17:25.880 --> 00:17:27.410 align:middle line:10%
this fantastic evidence.

00:17:27.410 --> 00:17:29.800 align:middle line:10%


00:17:29.800 --> 00:17:33.230 align:middle line:10%
We believe that other cases
around the planet are similar

00:17:33.230 --> 00:17:34.190 align:middle line:10%
to Antonio's.

00:17:34.190 --> 00:17:36.050 align:middle line:10%


00:17:36.050 --> 00:17:39.440 align:middle line:10%
In Turkey, Yan Zimarman.

00:17:39.440 --> 00:17:41.870 align:middle line:10%
In Mexico, Arturo Robles Gill.

00:17:41.870 --> 00:17:44.350 align:middle line:10%
In the United States,
Mauricio Ruiz.

00:17:44.350 --> 00:17:48.990 align:middle line:10%
Therefore, it seems that this
is all a strategy, a plan

00:17:48.990 --> 00:17:52.910 align:middle line:10%
to awaken the conscience of
man, to finally open our minds.

00:17:52.910 --> 00:17:57.060 align:middle line:90%


00:17:57.060 --> 00:18:00.750 align:middle line:84%
>> Milan is the largest
metropolitan area in Italy,

00:18:00.750 --> 00:18:04.380 align:middle line:84%
and the second largest city
in Italy, in population.

00:18:04.380 --> 00:18:07.530 align:middle line:84%
It is the capital of the
metropolitan city of Milan

00:18:07.530 --> 00:18:09.480 align:middle line:90%
and the Lombardy region.

00:18:09.480 --> 00:18:12.810 align:middle line:84%
Located in the north, it is
one of the most developed areas

00:18:12.810 --> 00:18:14.550 align:middle line:90%
of the country.

00:18:14.550 --> 00:18:16.860 align:middle line:84%
The gross domestic
product of Lombardy

00:18:16.860 --> 00:18:20.670 align:middle line:84%
has been estimated
at 366 billion Euros,

00:18:20.670 --> 00:18:22.980 align:middle line:90%
the second largest in Europe.

00:18:22.980 --> 00:18:26.040 align:middle line:84%
It is considered the economic
and industrial capital

00:18:26.040 --> 00:18:27.460 align:middle line:90%
of Italy.

00:18:27.460 --> 00:18:30.630 align:middle line:84%
It is also where the most famous
fashion center in the world

00:18:30.630 --> 00:18:32.250 align:middle line:90%
is established.

00:18:32.250 --> 00:18:35.760 align:middle line:84%
This is the primary reason
why Antonio Urzi changed

00:18:35.760 --> 00:18:38.610 align:middle line:84%
his residence from Livorno,
on the Italian coast

00:18:38.610 --> 00:18:41.700 align:middle line:84%
of the Mediterranean
Sea, to Milan.

00:18:41.700 --> 00:18:45.900 align:middle line:84%
One of the suburbs of
Milan is Cinisello Balsamo.

00:18:45.900 --> 00:18:50.250 align:middle line:84%
There, on the street of
Giovanni Battista Pergolesi,

00:18:50.250 --> 00:18:52.740 align:middle line:84%
is the attic where
Antonio Urzi lives

00:18:52.740 --> 00:18:57.470 align:middle line:84%
with his wife, Simona Sibilla,
and his little daughter.

00:18:57.470 --> 00:19:02.000 align:middle line:10%
>> We are on the street,
Giovanni Battista Pergolesi,

00:19:02.000 --> 00:19:07.920 align:middle line:10%
in Cinisello Balsamo, one of the
suburbs of the city of Milan.

00:19:07.920 --> 00:19:13.820 align:middle line:10%
It is here, in this place,
very close to a police station,

00:19:13.820 --> 00:19:17.660 align:middle line:10%
where Antonio,
during the year 2004,

00:19:17.660 --> 00:19:20.180 align:middle line:10%
had been videotaping some of
the most impressive videos.

00:19:20.180 --> 00:19:22.900 align:middle line:10%


00:19:22.900 --> 00:19:27.590 align:middle line:10%
Between June and December of
2004, he would get a half dozen

00:19:27.590 --> 00:19:28.830 align:middle line:10%
really spectacular videos.

00:19:28.830 --> 00:19:32.070 align:middle line:90%


00:19:32.070 --> 00:19:35.190 align:middle line:10%
Both from day and night,
from the first days of June.

00:19:35.190 --> 00:19:40.240 align:middle line:10%
And then, on July
30, a genuinely out

00:19:40.240 --> 00:19:41.990 align:middle line:10%
of the ordinary video,
where we observe

00:19:41.990 --> 00:19:44.930 align:middle line:10%
how this object literally
approaches his small window,

00:19:44.930 --> 00:19:50.200 align:middle line:10%
which is actually a skylight
on the roof of his house.

00:19:50.200 --> 00:19:53.910 align:middle line:10%
As a point of
reference, we can see

00:19:53.910 --> 00:19:55.857 align:middle line:10%
one of the frames
of Antonio's house

00:19:55.857 --> 00:19:56.940 align:middle line:10%
that appears in the video.

00:19:56.940 --> 00:20:01.200 align:middle line:90%


00:20:01.200 --> 00:20:03.340 align:middle line:10%
You will see, by the
small angle that it

00:20:03.340 --> 00:20:09.940 align:middle line:10%
has, all the difficulties
that Antonio has to deal with

00:20:09.940 --> 00:20:12.270 align:middle line:10%
to take these shots.

00:20:12.270 --> 00:20:17.530 align:middle line:10%
It would seem planned,
very well recorded,

00:20:17.530 --> 00:20:20.120 align:middle line:10%
but you can see how
difficult it is.

00:20:20.120 --> 00:20:24.060 align:middle line:84%
There are other videos where you
can see the object very close.

00:20:24.060 --> 00:20:28.000 align:middle line:10%
And also, at night, where,
despite the darkness,

00:20:28.000 --> 00:20:29.480 align:middle line:10%
the UFO remains in a shadow.

00:20:29.480 --> 00:20:33.640 align:middle line:90%


00:20:33.640 --> 00:20:36.340 align:middle line:10%
Its silhouette is
clearly noticeable.

00:20:36.340 --> 00:20:39.050 align:middle line:10%


00:20:39.050 --> 00:20:41.710 align:middle line:10%
There are two significant ones.

00:20:41.710 --> 00:20:45.560 align:middle line:10%
One at night, around
November 27, 2004,

00:20:45.560 --> 00:20:47.840 align:middle line:10%
that captures this structure.

00:20:47.840 --> 00:20:50.000 align:middle line:10%
And then on December 3,
the first time this object

00:20:50.000 --> 00:20:50.870 align:middle line:10%
is outlined.

00:20:50.870 --> 00:20:57.950 align:middle line:90%


00:20:57.950 --> 00:20:59.630 align:middle line:10%
It has the
characteristic form that

00:20:59.630 --> 00:21:03.440 align:middle line:10%
would appear in 2005, and
again in 2007, and 2008.

00:21:03.440 --> 00:21:06.640 align:middle line:10%
It is the same object that
has arisen both night and day.

00:21:06.640 --> 00:21:09.980 align:middle line:90%


00:21:09.980 --> 00:21:11.720 align:middle line:10%
This could be
compared to something

00:21:11.720 --> 00:21:17.190 align:middle line:10%
that has been happening
in Turkey, where

00:21:17.190 --> 00:21:18.940 align:middle line:10%
very similar ships
with the same structure

00:21:18.940 --> 00:21:20.523 align:middle line:10%
are those that
approach Yalcin Yalman.

00:21:20.523 --> 00:21:27.230 align:middle line:90%


00:21:27.230 --> 00:21:30.720 align:middle line:10%
In Antonio's case, the
forms are more traditional.

00:21:30.720 --> 00:21:35.060 align:middle line:10%
The objects are round,
as we see in the videos.

00:21:35.060 --> 00:21:38.875 align:middle line:10%
If you have seen the
complete collection of 2004,

00:21:38.875 --> 00:21:41.200 align:middle line:10%
you will find them spectacular.

00:21:41.200 --> 00:21:43.870 align:middle line:84%
Rarely has a person been able
to record such similar videos so

00:21:43.870 --> 00:21:45.820 align:middle line:90%
many times.

00:21:45.820 --> 00:21:47.750 align:middle line:10%
What does it mean?

00:21:47.750 --> 00:21:50.520 align:middle line:10%
Where does this lead us?

00:21:50.520 --> 00:21:52.770 align:middle line:10%
Are these beings looking for
Antonio to be videotaped,

00:21:52.770 --> 00:21:56.050 align:middle line:10%
to appear before the camera
and he will share them

00:21:56.050 --> 00:21:57.100 align:middle line:10%
with the world?

00:21:57.100 --> 00:21:59.480 align:middle line:10%


00:21:59.480 --> 00:22:04.370 align:middle line:10%
Personally, as a
researcher, I think so.

00:22:04.370 --> 00:22:06.390 align:middle line:10%
There cannot be a coincidence.

00:22:06.390 --> 00:22:08.660 align:middle line:10%
Or is this gentleman
deceiving us

00:22:08.660 --> 00:22:11.630 align:middle line:10%
all, and he has
an army of people

00:22:11.630 --> 00:22:16.160 align:middle line:10%
helping him to do something
that seems impossible?

00:22:16.160 --> 00:22:18.920 align:middle line:10%
Or it is, and it is, one of the
most amazing shreds of evidence

00:22:18.920 --> 00:22:21.850 align:middle line:10%
of all time.

>> We arrived in Antonio's
little house, a man who,

00:22:26.760 --> 00:22:30.240 align:middle line:84%
by the way, has never asked
for money for his videos.

I used to have this
kind of camera.

My camera's always
with me because I

00:25:32.350 --> 00:25:34.360 align:middle line:84%
want to be ready to
film at any moment.

00:25:34.360 --> 00:25:39.130 align:middle line:90%


00:25:39.130 --> 00:25:41.320 align:middle line:90%
The objects are always nearby.

00:25:41.320 --> 00:25:43.810 align:middle line:84%
Where I was standing, the
spaceship stopped above us.

00:25:43.810 --> 00:25:47.860 align:middle line:90%


00:25:47.860 --> 00:25:50.950 align:middle line:90%
I immediately took the camera.

00:25:50.950 --> 00:25:54.400 align:middle line:84%
And in June, 2004,
I was not going

00:25:54.400 --> 00:25:55.960 align:middle line:84%
to miss the opportunity
to film that

00:25:55.960 --> 00:25:57.340 align:middle line:90%
object flying in front of me.

00:25:57.340 --> 00:25:59.415 align:middle line:90%


00:25:59.415 --> 00:26:00.790 align:middle line:84%
Allow me to show
you how I filmed

00:26:00.790 --> 00:26:01.900 align:middle line:90%
the object, at that time.

00:26:01.900 --> 00:26:06.060 align:middle line:90%


00:26:06.060 --> 00:26:10.510 align:middle line:84%
I'm generally at this level,
where I can see the object.

00:26:10.510 --> 00:26:13.000 align:middle line:84%
I have the habit to
look up everywhere I go.

00:26:13.000 --> 00:26:14.755 align:middle line:84%
My head turns up
towards the sky.

00:26:14.755 --> 00:26:17.690 align:middle line:90%


00:26:17.690 --> 00:26:20.170 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes I just look down for
an ancient stone, you know?

00:26:20.170 --> 00:26:22.780 align:middle line:90%


00:26:22.780 --> 00:26:26.230 align:middle line:84%
And, at that moment, I
looked for my camera.

00:26:26.230 --> 00:26:29.888 align:middle line:84%
And I step on a stool that
allows me to look out.

00:26:29.888 --> 00:26:31.180 align:middle line:90%
That is when I start to record.

00:26:31.180 --> 00:26:34.840 align:middle line:90%


00:26:34.840 --> 00:26:38.080 align:middle line:84%
With the window
open, this way, it's

00:26:38.080 --> 00:26:40.075 align:middle line:84%
easy to film the objects
from this location.

00:26:40.075 --> 00:26:45.570 align:middle line:90%


00:26:45.570 --> 00:26:46.680 align:middle line:90%
I always did this.

00:26:46.680 --> 00:26:50.520 align:middle line:90%


00:26:50.520 --> 00:26:53.990 align:middle line:84%
And in 2004, when the
spaceship showed up.

00:26:53.990 --> 00:26:55.365 align:middle line:84%
They were still
at this location.

00:26:55.365 --> 00:26:58.740 align:middle line:90%


00:26:58.740 --> 00:27:00.540 align:middle line:84%
It seemed that they
knew I would film them.

00:27:00.540 --> 00:27:03.180 align:middle line:90%


00:27:03.180 --> 00:27:06.230 align:middle line:84%
In another position, I
have some other videos

00:27:06.230 --> 00:27:08.700 align:middle line:84%
that show this part of
the window as a reference.

00:27:08.700 --> 00:27:15.240 align:middle line:90%


00:27:15.240 --> 00:27:17.630 align:middle line:84%
When the object moved
from left to right,

00:27:17.630 --> 00:27:20.160 align:middle line:84%
I had to open the lens to
get a better visual field.

00:27:20.160 --> 00:27:23.370 align:middle line:90%


00:27:23.370 --> 00:27:25.860 align:middle line:84%
Remember that we have a
video of the UFO recorded

00:27:25.860 --> 00:27:28.410 align:middle line:84%
in June that looks like
the one of Vedonsky,

00:27:28.410 --> 00:27:30.840 align:middle line:90%
shaped like a bell.

00:27:30.840 --> 00:27:34.798 align:middle line:84%
This is the way I've been
filming here, in this house.

00:27:34.798 --> 00:27:37.950 align:middle line:10%

00:27:45.570 --> 00:27:48.600 align:middle line:90%


00:27:48.600 --> 00:27:52.740 align:middle line:84%
>> The ship's images recorded by
Antonio during his first years

00:27:52.740 --> 00:27:57.210 align:middle line:84%
were filmed on videotape,
using an analog camera.

00:27:57.210 --> 00:28:00.660 align:middle line:84%
It was in 2003, when he
bought his first camera,

00:28:00.660 --> 00:28:03.030 align:middle line:90%
and then began recording.

00:28:03.030 --> 00:28:06.720 align:middle line:84%
His first UFO video
came in September.

00:28:06.720 --> 00:28:11.370 align:middle line:84%
It was very low quality and not
an entirely convincing video.

00:28:11.370 --> 00:28:14.400 align:middle line:84%
However, it was just the
beginning of a series

00:28:14.400 --> 00:28:18.120 align:middle line:84%
that he would record in
June, 2004, all of them

00:28:18.120 --> 00:28:19.710 align:middle line:90%
during the day.

00:28:19.710 --> 00:28:23.130 align:middle line:84%
The ships filmed by Antonio
were at a low altitude.

00:28:23.130 --> 00:28:27.420 align:middle line:84%
And they appeared practically
in front of Antonio's eyes.

00:28:27.420 --> 00:28:31.590 align:middle line:84%
Unfortunately, his camera had
a reduced resolution and scope.

00:28:31.590 --> 00:28:34.410 align:middle line:84%
Years later, thanks to
the analysis made on them,

00:28:34.410 --> 00:28:38.010 align:middle line:84%
it was determined that the
objects had different sizes.

00:28:38.010 --> 00:28:42.990 align:middle line:10%
One seemed to be almost 99 feet
long, and the other, only about

00:28:42.990 --> 00:28:44.160 align:middle line:10%
16.

00:28:44.160 --> 00:28:46.890 align:middle line:10%
On June 4th, at
10:30 in the morning,

00:28:46.890 --> 00:28:49.980 align:middle line:10%
Antonio was able to
capture, for the first time,

00:28:49.980 --> 00:28:53.740 align:middle line:10%
images of exceptional
clarity and medium size.

00:28:53.740 --> 00:28:56.190 align:middle line:84%
One appeared as a
metallic object,

00:28:56.190 --> 00:29:00.760 align:middle line:84%
possibly about 32 to
49 feet in diameter.

00:29:00.760 --> 00:29:04.150 align:middle line:84%
On June 17, at 07:28
in the morning,

00:29:04.150 --> 00:29:07.180 align:middle line:84%
he filmed an object that,
according to investigations,

00:29:07.180 --> 00:29:11.930 align:middle line:84%
seemed to be larger, maybe
about 98 feet in diameter.

00:29:11.930 --> 00:29:13.960 align:middle line:90%
The UFO stopped.

00:29:13.960 --> 00:29:16.090 align:middle line:90%
It looked as if it was posing.

00:29:16.090 --> 00:29:19.230 align:middle line:84%
You can see it is
evident in the image.

00:29:19.230 --> 00:29:22.980 align:middle line:84%
Later, on June 30,
another UFO, an object

00:29:22.980 --> 00:29:25.830 align:middle line:84%
of approximately 33
feet in diameter,

00:29:25.830 --> 00:29:30.120 align:middle line:84%
appeared in front Urzi's
house at a very low altitude.

00:29:30.120 --> 00:29:32.700 align:middle line:84%
In the image, you can
see the window's frame

00:29:32.700 --> 00:29:35.640 align:middle line:84%
and how it is open,
eliminating any possibility

00:29:35.640 --> 00:29:37.440 align:middle line:90%
of being a fraud.

00:29:37.440 --> 00:29:40.860 align:middle line:10%
The evidence, in addition to
the investigation and analysis,

00:29:40.860 --> 00:29:45.231 align:middle line:10%
revealed that it was
not a scale model.

00:29:45.231 --> 00:29:48.160 align:middle line:10%
>> Here we have four objects.

00:29:48.160 --> 00:29:52.670 align:middle line:10%

or less, you can

know if an object has a
large or small dimension,

00:29:59.150 --> 00:30:02.790 align:middle line:84%
and if it's a real object,
because of the volume it has.

00:30:02.790 --> 00:30:09.450 align:middle line:84%
This looks as if it was 32.8
feet to 65.6 feet in size.

00:30:09.450 --> 00:30:10.650 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:30:12.758 --> 00:30:15.300 align:middle line:84%
>>INTERPRETER: In this case,
and because of the many analysis

00:30:15.300 --> 00:30:18.210 align:middle line:84%
in the interaction of the
light with their surface,

00:30:18.210 --> 00:30:20.490 align:middle line:84%
it is possible to
understand that it presents

00:30:20.490 --> 00:30:23.490 align:middle line:84%
some reflections in the
form of very small points,

00:30:23.490 --> 00:30:27.180 align:middle line:84%
like the dish that
was recorded in 2004.

00:30:27.180 --> 00:30:30.540 align:middle line:84%
And that seems like
a very large object.

00:30:30.540 --> 00:30:34.560 align:middle line:84%
And here, in this one,
also recorded in 2004,

00:30:34.560 --> 00:30:36.810 align:middle line:84%
it also looks to be
a big object that

00:30:36.810 --> 00:30:40.470 align:middle line:84%
has a great volume in
comparison with this here.

00:30:40.470 --> 00:30:43.410 align:middle line:84%
The main point is
that in general bases,

00:30:43.410 --> 00:30:45.090 align:middle line:84%
the light elevation
from the position

00:30:45.090 --> 00:30:48.000 align:middle line:84%
the object is in with
respect to the sun,

00:30:48.000 --> 00:30:50.970 align:middle line:84%
there still need to be
investigative procedures.

00:30:50.970 --> 00:30:56.790 align:middle line:84%
In this case, the object here is
bigger than this one, and this,

00:30:56.790 --> 00:30:58.140 align:middle line:90%
then this.

00:30:58.140 --> 00:31:01.290 align:middle line:84%
And this other is
smaller than these two.

00:31:01.290 --> 00:31:03.660 align:middle line:84%
This is an object
of great dimensions.

00:31:03.660 --> 00:31:06.240 align:middle line:90%
Almost 98.4 feet.

00:31:06.240 --> 00:31:10.440 align:middle line:84%
This, maybe, is
32.8 to 49.2 feet.

00:31:10.440 --> 00:31:12.570 align:middle line:84%
And this here, I
think it could be

00:31:12.570 --> 00:31:16.740 align:middle line:90%
55 to 65.6 feet, approximately.

00:31:16.740 --> 00:31:19.020 align:middle line:90%
This one, 198.4.

00:31:19.020 --> 00:31:22.050 align:middle line:90%
And this, 55.7 feet.

00:31:22.050 --> 00:31:28.020 align:middle line:84%
And this is about
16.4 to 19.6 feet.

00:31:28.020 --> 00:31:31.680 align:middle line:84%
>> On July 20th, according
to Antonio's testimony,

00:31:31.680 --> 00:31:34.560 align:middle line:84%
he recorded two different
objects within a few minutes

00:31:34.560 --> 00:31:35.850 align:middle line:90%
of each other.

00:31:35.850 --> 00:31:38.380 align:middle line:84%
The UFOs, according
to the analysis,

00:31:38.380 --> 00:31:41.350 align:middle line:84%
were more than 60
feet in diameter.

00:31:41.350 --> 00:31:45.150 align:middle line:84%
The first video was
recorded at 03:49 PM.

00:31:45.150 --> 00:31:48.030 align:middle line:84%
The second, just
four minutes later.

00:31:48.030 --> 00:31:51.360 align:middle line:84%
However, you can see the
difference was remarkable.

00:31:51.360 --> 00:31:57.590 align:middle line:90%


00:31:57.590 --> 00:32:01.310 align:middle line:10%
In November of that same year,
Antonio started recording

00:32:01.310 --> 00:32:02.660 align:middle line:10%
during the night.

00:32:02.660 --> 00:32:05.600 align:middle line:10%
On November 18th, he
filmed a metallic ship

00:32:05.600 --> 00:32:10.640 align:middle line:10%
of significant size for
around 45 minutes, at 1:00 AM.

00:32:10.640 --> 00:32:12.740 align:middle line:10%
He was able to see
a metallic body

00:32:12.740 --> 00:32:16.535 align:middle line:10%
with a violet light that was
moving above and below the UFO.

00:32:16.535 --> 00:32:22.160 align:middle line:90%


00:32:22.160 --> 00:32:25.160 align:middle line:10%
On November 27th, at
about the same time,

00:32:25.160 --> 00:32:27.590 align:middle line:10%
after midnight, he
was able to record

00:32:27.590 --> 00:32:30.950 align:middle line:10%
a ship that came directly
to where he was standing.

00:32:30.950 --> 00:32:34.400 align:middle line:10%
Below it was a reflection
that, according to Antonio,

00:32:34.400 --> 00:32:36.110 align:middle line:10%
seemed like the
lights of a soccer

00:32:36.110 --> 00:32:38.900 align:middle line:10%
field that was near his home.

00:32:38.900 --> 00:32:43.580 align:middle line:10%
Finally, on December 3rd,
around 10:00 at night,

00:32:43.580 --> 00:32:45.950 align:middle line:10%
he was able to capture an
object that would appear

00:32:45.950 --> 00:32:48.890 align:middle line:10%
in other videos, years later.

00:32:48.890 --> 00:32:51.950 align:middle line:10%
It seems like it stopped in
front of Antonio's house,

00:32:51.950 --> 00:32:53.780 align:middle line:10%
in Cinisello Balsamo.

00:32:53.780 --> 00:33:00.120 align:middle line:90%


00:33:00.120 --> 00:33:04.180 align:middle line:10%
Analysis showed that
these objects were real.

00:33:04.180 --> 00:33:07.540 align:middle line:10%
They were not models or
images produced on a computer.

00:33:07.540 --> 00:33:11.680 align:middle line:10%

00:34:01.310 --> 00:34:03.670 align:middle line:84%
It was only a
personal experience.

00:34:05.085 --> 00:34:07.030 align:middle line:84%
And people question
why it was only

00:34:07.030 --> 00:34:09.370 align:middle line:84%
me who could record
these spaceships.

00:34:09.370 --> 00:34:12.350 align:middle line:90%
But it's not my fault.

00:34:13.150 --> 00:34:16.000 align:middle line:84%
It's not me who
decides this situation.

If the spacecraft
arrives, I will film them.

In August of 2003, I
had a camera with me.

00:34:35.120 --> 00:34:37.800 align:middle line:84%
I did not know what was about
to happen at that moment.

00:34:41.632 --> 00:34:43.340 align:middle line:10%
I never thought about
recording the UFOs.

incredible collection

of hundreds and hundreds
of videos of UFOs.

00:34:58.930 --> 00:35:00.700 align:middle line:84%
Of course, everything
is recorded,

00:35:00.700 --> 00:35:05.260 align:middle line:84%
including balloons that,
initially, I thought were UFOs.

00:35:05.260 --> 00:35:08.560 align:middle line:84%
After reviewing the videos,
you can see the thread on them.

I consider myself
an investigator

00:35:13.630 --> 00:35:15.820 align:middle line:84%

intimately experienced

this phenomenon for many years.

00:35:20.360 --> 00:35:22.900 align:middle line:84%
I can say I have a deep
conscience about this,

not only in a technical way,
but also in a spiritual sense.

00:35:36.040 --> 00:35:37.820 align:middle line:84%
And those beings
have talked to me.

00:35:40.390 --> 00:35:43.030 align:middle line:84%

to me the reasons

This is an extraordinary
case in which we still

00:36:04.740 --> 00:36:06.075 align:middle line:90%

Incredible.

It is a case that, perhaps,
the human mind cannot yet

understand or imagine.

We have seen that the others
contacted only saw two,

or three, or maybe
five spaceships.

00:36:33.040 --> 00:36:37.800 align:middle line:84%
Antonio-- he has
seen many, many more.

00:36:37.800 --> 00:36:41.220 align:middle line:84%
But as a researcher,
we did not publish them

00:36:41.220 --> 00:36:44.560 align:middle line:84%
because we do not
know what they are.

00:36:44.560 --> 00:36:48.790 align:middle line:10%
This event is something
that happens up in the sky.

00:36:48.790 --> 00:36:50.730 align:middle line:10%
And you can watch it.

They are not of this earth.

It is much more significant,
and much more critical,

and complex than we can
imagine in our fantasies.

00:37:04.530 --> 00:37:08.180 align:middle line:84%

talent working with computers,

as well as an impressive
level of analysis.

00:37:35.700 --> 00:37:39.660 align:middle line:84%
I can tell you that in all
the videos that were reviewed,

00:37:39.660 --> 00:37:43.470 align:middle line:84%
we proved that none of
this material was false.

00:37:43.470 --> 00:37:45.870 align:middle line:90%

revealed much more information
