00:00:50.650 --> 00:00:54.850 align:middle line:84%
I noted it was similar to the
one that was observed on video

00:00:54.850 --> 00:01:00.340 align:middle line:84%
recorded above the Kremlin
the 9 of December 2009.

And for the time being,
we are not sure still

00:01:57.730 --> 00:02:00.360 align:middle line:10%
about what this object is.

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:03.850 align:middle line:10%
And the information that
we do have on the object

00:02:03.850 --> 00:02:07.150 align:middle line:10%

fired from a nuclear

00:02:40.070 --> 00:02:43.630 align:middle line:10%
But telemetry showed everything
went well in the first two

00:02:43.630 --> 00:02:45.560 align:middle line:10%
stages of the flight.

00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:48.370 align:middle line:10%
However, an engine problem
developed in the third stage.

the case of the misfire.

00:02:51.700 --> 00:02:54.580 align:middle line:10%
>> It is likely that Russia
did Indeed inform the Norwegian

00:02:54.580 --> 00:02:55.810 align:middle line:10%
government about the test.

00:02:55.810 --> 00:02:57.520 align:middle line:10%
And though the cause
of the spiraling

00:02:57.520 --> 00:02:59.860 align:middle line:10%
light in the Nordic
sky is now known,

00:02:59.860 --> 00:03:04.180 align:middle line:10%
it does not make the images
any less spectacular.

00:03:04.180 --> 00:03:07.390 align:middle line:10%
>> According to a statement, the
missile failed for an unknown

00:03:07.390 --> 00:03:11.700 align:middle line:10%
reason and generated the
so-called Norway spiral,

00:03:11.700 --> 00:03:15.190 align:middle line:10%
a spiral figure in the sky that
ended up generating an empty

black space.

00:03:17.330 --> 00:03:21.500 align:middle line:84%
An event that was observed by
thousands of people in Norway,

00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:25.130 align:middle line:84%
especially in Tromso,
facing the Atlantic Ocean.

00:03:25.130 --> 00:03:28.730 align:middle line:84%
Never before had something
like this been seen.

00:03:28.730 --> 00:03:30.490 align:middle line:10%
Because a failure
of this missile

00:03:30.490 --> 00:03:34.100 align:middle line:10%
is simultaneous to the presence
of the large tetrahedron shaped

00:03:34.100 --> 00:03:40.060 align:middle line:10%
object above the Kremlin,
it could be a warning,

00:03:40.060 --> 00:03:43.570 align:middle line:10%
especially since Bulava type
missiles represent of Russia's

00:03:43.570 --> 00:03:47.440 align:middle line:10%
most advanced strategic weapon.

00:03:47.440 --> 00:03:52.000 align:middle line:84%
Bulava rockets can fly up
to 9,000 kilometers away,

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:55.360 align:middle line:84%
carry six nuclear
warheads, and are

00:03:55.360 --> 00:03:57.640 align:middle line:84%
armed with computers
that allow them

00:03:57.640 --> 00:04:02.440 align:middle line:84%
to launch decoys to avoid being
intercepted by defense systems.

00:04:02.440 --> 00:04:04.685 align:middle line:84%
This is one of the most
important projects.

00:04:04.685 --> 00:04:14.210 align:middle line:90%


00:04:14.210 --> 00:04:17.269 align:middle line:84%
On November 8,
2010, another event

00:04:17.269 --> 00:04:21.529 align:middle line:84%
occurred that, until today,
has no real explanation.

00:04:21.529 --> 00:04:25.550 align:middle line:84%
Today, it is remembered as the
mystery missile in the United

00:04:25.550 --> 00:04:26.540 align:middle line:90%
States.

00:04:26.540 --> 00:04:30.590 align:middle line:84%
That day, a cameraman from
the CBS network, Gil Leyvas,

00:04:30.590 --> 00:04:34.430 align:middle line:84%
captured images of what clearly
looked like a missile ascending

00:04:34.430 --> 00:04:38.760 align:middle line:84%
into space off the California
coast, according to analysis,

00:04:38.760 --> 00:04:44.130 align:middle line:84%
very close to Catalina Island
off the Los Angeles coast.

00:04:44.130 --> 00:04:47.100 align:middle line:10%
>> The video of what looks for
all the world like the contrail

00:04:47.100 --> 00:04:51.030 align:middle line:10%
of a missile was shot Monday
evening by KCBS cameraman Gil

00:04:51.030 --> 00:04:53.925 align:middle line:10%
Leyvas from a news
helicopter over Los Angeles.

00:04:53.925 --> 00:04:57.990 align:middle line:10%
>> I saw a big plume
coming up rising from,

00:04:57.990 --> 00:04:59.640 align:middle line:10%
it looked like
beyond the horizon.

00:04:59.640 --> 00:05:01.140 align:middle line:10%
And it continued to grow.

00:05:01.140 --> 00:05:04.350 align:middle line:10%
>> He zoomed in and stayed
on it for about 10 minutes.

00:05:04.350 --> 00:05:06.380 align:middle line:10%
To him, it looked like
an incoming missile.

00:05:06.380 --> 00:05:07.180 align:middle line:10%
It was unique.

00:05:07.180 --> 00:05:08.730 align:middle line:10%
It was moving.

00:05:08.730 --> 00:05:10.470 align:middle line:10%
It was growing in the sky.

00:05:10.470 --> 00:05:13.020 align:middle line:10%
>> The Pentagon spends billions
of dollars a year making sure

00:05:13.020 --> 00:05:15.220 align:middle line:10%
it is never surprised
by a missile launch.

00:05:15.220 --> 00:05:19.780 align:middle line:10%
So finding out what the camera
saw became a top priority.

00:05:19.780 --> 00:05:22.440 align:middle line:10%
Both Navy and Air Force
insisted they had not

00:05:22.440 --> 00:05:23.870 align:middle line:10%
launched any missiles.

00:05:23.870 --> 00:05:25.800 align:middle line:10%
And the North American
Air Defense Command,

00:05:25.800 --> 00:05:28.350 align:middle line:10%
which is supposed to
track incoming missiles

00:05:28.350 --> 00:05:31.740 align:middle line:10%
declared it had not been
fired by any other military.

00:05:31.740 --> 00:05:34.100 align:middle line:10%
But nobody could
say what it was.

00:05:34.100 --> 00:05:36.990 align:middle line:10%
>> Nobody's willing to
make a definitive statement

00:05:36.990 --> 00:05:40.360 align:middle line:10%
because they just don't have
the data to prove it was

00:05:40.360 --> 00:05:41.160 align:middle line:10%
an airplane.

00:05:41.160 --> 00:05:43.500 align:middle line:10%
They have the data
to demonstrate

00:05:43.500 --> 00:05:48.070 align:middle line:10%
that it was not a missile, but
they can't prove what it was.

00:05:48.070 --> 00:05:51.220 align:middle line:10%
>> On the other side, Fox
network presented the following

00:05:51.220 --> 00:05:52.680 align:middle line:10%
report.

00:05:52.680 --> 00:05:55.180 align:middle line:84%
>> The Pentagon still does not
know that there was a missile

00:05:55.180 --> 00:05:55.980 align:middle line:90%
launch.

00:05:55.980 --> 00:05:56.785 align:middle line:90%
Can't confirm it.

00:05:56.785 --> 00:05:58.660 align:middle line:84%
If there was one, they
don't know who did it,

00:05:58.660 --> 00:06:00.280 align:middle line:90%
or how it happened.

00:06:00.280 --> 00:06:01.580 align:middle line:90%
So they're making calls now.

00:06:01.580 --> 00:06:03.550 align:middle line:90%
The Navy's still checking.

00:06:03.550 --> 00:06:06.910 align:middle line:84%
NORAD and NORTHCOM are
still checking to find out

00:06:06.910 --> 00:06:08.500 align:middle line:90%
what, if anything, happened.

00:06:08.500 --> 00:06:12.070 align:middle line:84%
Now, the possible suspects
are Vandenberg Air Force base,

00:06:12.070 --> 00:06:13.750 align:middle line:90%
which does do missile launches.

00:06:13.750 --> 00:06:15.460 align:middle line:90%
They say it wasn't them.

00:06:15.460 --> 00:06:17.290 align:middle line:84%
Point Mugu Naval
Air Station, closer

00:06:17.290 --> 00:06:20.110 align:middle line:84%
in to Los Angeles, which
also does missile testing,

00:06:20.110 --> 00:06:21.398 align:middle line:90%
it wasn't them.

00:06:21.398 --> 00:06:22.690 align:middle line:90%
So who else could it have been?

00:06:22.690 --> 00:06:27.280 align:middle line:84%
A Navy ship, a Navy submarine,
a private contractor?

00:06:27.280 --> 00:06:28.840 align:middle line:84%
We checked with
the FAA, and they

00:06:28.840 --> 00:06:31.270 align:middle line:84%
say for there to be a
private commercial launch,

00:06:31.270 --> 00:06:32.800 align:middle line:84%
there has to be
a license issued.

00:06:32.800 --> 00:06:37.240 align:middle line:10%
And no license was
issued last night.

00:06:37.240 --> 00:06:41.010 align:middle line:10%
>> The Russia Today, RT, Network
represents a spokesperson

00:06:41.010 --> 00:06:44.480 align:middle line:10%
for the Russian government at
international level presented

00:06:44.480 --> 00:06:47.940 align:middle line:10%
the following report where even
Russian experts consider that

00:06:47.940 --> 00:06:50.490 align:middle line:10%
it was a missile.

00:06:50.490 --> 00:06:53.400 align:middle line:84%
>> A lot of people are not
buying that information.

00:06:53.400 --> 00:06:55.800 align:middle line:84%
Now, most of us
have seen the video

00:06:55.800 --> 00:07:00.630 align:middle line:84%
by now of this huge
condensation trail going

00:07:00.630 --> 00:07:04.230 align:middle line:84%
after what looks like a
missile or some sort of rocket.

00:07:04.230 --> 00:07:07.140 align:middle line:84%
Now, we've talked to a
lot of military experts

00:07:07.140 --> 00:07:08.610 align:middle line:90%
who have weighed in on this.

00:07:08.610 --> 00:07:10.440 align:middle line:84%
Some of them say
that it could have

00:07:10.440 --> 00:07:12.930 align:middle line:84%
been a missile that was
fired off accidentally

00:07:12.930 --> 00:07:14.280 align:middle line:90%
by the US military.

00:07:14.280 --> 00:07:18.060 align:middle line:84%
Some say that it was just
some sort of fighter jet.

00:07:18.060 --> 00:07:20.190 align:middle line:84%
And the trail that
it left behind

00:07:20.190 --> 00:07:21.870 align:middle line:90%
made it look like a missile.

00:07:21.870 --> 00:07:24.540 align:middle line:84%
However, the fact
that the US government

00:07:24.540 --> 00:07:29.490 align:middle line:84%
has been hush on this, saying
they don't know what it is

00:07:29.490 --> 00:07:32.850 align:middle line:84%
has raised a lot of suspicions
about what this truly is.

00:07:32.850 --> 00:07:35.860 align:middle line:84%
Now, we've talked to military
experts from around the world,

00:07:35.860 --> 00:07:38.310 align:middle line:84%
including in Russia, who
have weighed in on what

00:07:38.310 --> 00:07:41.640 align:middle line:90%
they think might have happened.

00:07:41.640 --> 00:07:46.320 align:middle line:84%
>> All experts, I think, agree
that it's the launch some kind

00:07:46.320 --> 00:07:50.670 align:middle line:84%
of ballistic missile,
probably under water.

00:07:50.670 --> 00:07:52.900 align:middle line:84%
And I think that it's
a great embarrassment

00:07:52.900 --> 00:07:55.480 align:middle line:84%
for the American
military to show

00:07:55.480 --> 00:07:59.310 align:middle line:84%
with all the billions spent
on the missile defense,

00:07:59.310 --> 00:08:02.370 align:middle line:84%
United States basically
is vulnerable to this kind

00:08:02.370 --> 00:08:06.550 align:middle line:90%
of unwarranted attacks.

00:08:06.550 --> 00:08:09.000 align:middle line:84%
>> There would never be
a convincing explanation

00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:10.770 align:middle line:90%
for these images.

00:08:10.770 --> 00:08:13.290 align:middle line:84%
According to the Pentagon,
it was a contrail

00:08:13.290 --> 00:08:15.780 align:middle line:84%
of a commercial airplane
heading from the ocean

00:08:15.780 --> 00:08:17.610 align:middle line:90%
into the United States.

00:08:17.610 --> 00:08:19.650 align:middle line:90%
But it never proved it.

00:08:19.650 --> 00:08:21.450 align:middle line:90%
Which airplane did it?

00:08:21.450 --> 00:08:22.470 align:middle line:90%
Where was it going?

00:08:22.470 --> 00:08:25.350 align:middle line:90%


00:08:25.350 --> 00:08:27.300 align:middle line:84%
If it had been a
commercial airplane,

00:08:27.300 --> 00:08:30.630 align:middle line:84%
it could have been demonstrated
with great precision,

00:11:57.110 --> 00:11:59.870 align:middle line:84%
I think that whoever are
aboard these craft have been

00:11:59.870 --> 00:12:01.700 align:middle line:84%
monitoring the
nuclear arms race,

00:12:01.700 --> 00:12:04.730 align:middle line:84%
both here and in the

00:12:04.730 --> 00:12:08.570 align:middle line:84%
My view is that they are
keeping an eye on things.

00:12:08.570 --> 00:12:10.980 align:middle line:84%
They are someone
from somewhere else.

00:12:10.980 --> 00:12:14.450 align:middle line:84%
And because of the very
dangerous situation

00:12:14.450 --> 00:12:16.520 align:middle line:84%
during the Cold
War, when we almost

00:12:16.520 --> 00:12:19.940 align:middle line:84%

on a number of occasions--

00:12:19.940 --> 00:12:23.870 align:middle line:84%
the Cuban Missile Crisis
being the best known example--

00:12:23.870 --> 00:12:27.350 align:middle line:84%
I think whoever they are, are
just monitoring very closely

00:12:27.350 --> 00:12:29.300 align:middle line:84%
the fact that humans
now have weapons

00:12:29.300 --> 00:12:32.360 align:middle line:84%
that can destroy not
only human civilization,

00:12:32.360 --> 00:12:34.580 align:middle line:84%
but pollute the
environment of the planet

00:12:34.580 --> 00:12:37.410 align:middle line:84%

for many, many years.

00:12:37.410 --> 00:12:41.360 align:middle line:84%
I think they have a concern for

And I've interviewed ex-Air

00:12:46.280 --> 00:12:49.250 align:middle line:84%

said that UFOs hover

00:12:49.250 --> 00:12:51.940 align:middle line:84%
over their missiles and
the missiles malfunction.

00:12:51.940 --> 00:12:54.320 align:middle line:84%
There are similar reports
in the Soviet Union

00:12:54.320 --> 00:12:57.200 align:middle line:84%
that have now become available
to Western journalists

00:12:57.200 --> 00:12:58.590 align:middle line:90%

00:12:58.590 --> 00:13:02.030 align:middle line:84%
So not only are they
monitoring nuclear weapons

00:13:02.030 --> 00:13:04.800 align:middle line:84%
on an ongoing basis,
from time to time,

00:13:04.800 --> 00:13:08.060 align:middle line:84%
it appears that they
actually interject themselves

00:13:08.060 --> 00:13:11.030 align:middle line:84%
into the situation and
interfere with the functionality

00:13:11.030 --> 00:13:12.140 align:middle line:90%
of the weapons.

00:13:12.140 --> 00:13:14.120 align:middle line:84%
This has occurred a

according to my retired

00:13:17.870 --> 00:13:20.180 align:middle line:84%
>> According to the
Robert Hastings' research,

00:13:20.180 --> 00:13:24.140 align:middle line:84%
reports on UFOs on nuclear
bases are quite often.

I am just barely scratching
the surface, in my opinion.

00:13:35.900 --> 00:13:39.110 align:middle line:84%
It's difficult for witnesses
to come forward and talk

00:13:39.110 --> 00:13:40.820 align:middle line:90%
about these things.

00:13:40.820 --> 00:13:43.280 align:middle line:84%
I think there are many
more cases than the ones

00:13:43.280 --> 00:13:44.210 align:middle line:90%
that I've uncovered.

00:13:44.210 --> 00:13:47.090 align:middle line:84%
But there are at least
100 that I can point to

>> My witnesses include
persons who launched,

would be responsible for
launching nuclear weapons--

nuclear bombers--

00:14:01.250 --> 00:14:03.920 align:middle line:84%
launch officers, missile

00:14:03.920 --> 00:14:06.800 align:middle line:84%
missile maintenance
officers, security guards

00:14:06.800 --> 00:14:08.810 align:middle line:90%
at nuclear missile sites.

00:14:08.810 --> 00:14:12.170 align:middle line:84%
These are persons that the
US government entrusted

00:14:12.170 --> 00:14:15.650 align:middle line:84%
with the responsibility
of starting World War III.

00:14:15.650 --> 00:14:17.480 align:middle line:84%
If the President of
the United States

00:14:17.480 --> 00:14:21.020 align:middle line:84%
had given an order to launch a
nuclear war against the Soviet

00:14:21.020 --> 00:14:23.270 align:middle line:84%
Union, the people
that I've interviewed,

00:14:23.270 --> 00:14:25.130 align:middle line:84%
the launch officers
in particular,

00:14:25.130 --> 00:14:27.230 align:middle line:84%
would have been among
the group of officers

00:14:27.230 --> 00:14:29.330 align:middle line:84%
that would have actually
launched nuclear missiles

00:14:29.330 --> 00:14:31.010 align:middle line:90%
against the Soviet Union.

00:14:31.010 --> 00:14:33.830 align:middle line:84%
So they're very
trustworthy, very reliable,

00:14:33.830 --> 00:14:36.290 align:middle line:84%
very psychologically
stable individuals.

00:14:36.290 --> 00:14:40.280 align:middle line:84%
The government would not entrust
this grave responsibility

00:14:40.280 --> 00:14:41.720 align:middle line:90%
to just anyone.

00:14:41.720 --> 00:14:43.940 align:middle line:84%
And yet, over 130
of these people

00:14:43.940 --> 00:14:46.910 align:middle line:84%
now, over the years that I've
tracked down and interviewed,

00:14:46.910 --> 00:14:49.100 align:middle line:84%
are saying that on
occasion they're

00:14:49.100 --> 00:14:51.950 align:middle line:84%
down in the launch control
facility underground.

00:14:51.950 --> 00:14:54.920 align:middle line:84%
They get a call from their
guard at ground level

00:14:54.920 --> 00:14:58.200 align:middle line:84%
scared, very frightened,
screaming into the phone.

00:14:58.200 --> 00:15:01.220 align:middle line:84%
There's a round object hovering
over the missile launch control

00:15:01.220 --> 00:15:02.330 align:middle line:90%
facility.

00:15:02.330 --> 00:15:04.310 align:middle line:10%
And these officers
say, you know, they're

00:15:04.310 --> 00:15:07.520 align:middle line:10%
about to ask these guards
what have you been drinking.

00:15:07.520 --> 00:15:09.680 align:middle line:10%
They doubt what
they're being told.

00:15:09.680 --> 00:15:12.080 align:middle line:10%
But before they can get the
words out of their mouths,

00:15:12.080 --> 00:15:14.810 align:middle line:10%
suddenly their missiles
begin malfunctioning.

00:15:14.810 --> 00:15:18.140 align:middle line:10%
What the Air Force calls
dropping off alert status.

00:15:18.140 --> 00:15:22.010 align:middle line:10%
And military investigators
come in, debrief,

00:15:22.010 --> 00:15:23.810 align:middle line:10%
interrogate these individuals.

00:15:23.810 --> 00:15:25.160 align:middle line:90%
Swear them to secrecy.

00:15:25.160 --> 00:15:27.950 align:middle line:84%
Say you must never
talk about this ever.

00:15:27.950 --> 00:15:31.100 align:middle line:84%
And it's decades, 20,
30, 40 years later

00:15:31.100 --> 00:15:32.720 align:middle line:84%
before they're
willing to talk to me.

00:15:32.720 --> 00:15:37.670 align:middle line:84%
They're so concerned about the
government, the FBI, or someone

00:15:37.670 --> 00:15:40.940 align:middle line:84%
from the Pentagon
creating problems for them

00:15:40.940 --> 00:15:44.470 align:middle line:84%
because they've come
forward and talked to me.

00:15:44.470 --> 00:15:47.050 align:middle line:84%

2009 when that pyramidal
object remained on red square

00:15:50.920 --> 00:15:54.490 align:middle line:84%

related to the launch

00:15:54.490 --> 00:15:57.820 align:middle line:84%
of the Bulava missile
over the White Sea.

00:15:57.820 --> 00:15:59.660 align:middle line:84%

00:16:02.620 --> 00:16:05.110 align:middle line:90%
in the famous Norwegian spiral.

00:16:05.110 --> 00:16:08.680 align:middle line:10%
However, what was the reason
why the same large object

00:16:08.680 --> 00:16:10.120 align:middle line:10%
was presented on the Pentagon?

00:16:12.770 --> 00:16:18.410 align:middle line:10%
By deeply investigating the news

00:16:18.410 --> 00:16:20.960 align:middle line:10%
we found one that could

undoubtedly means a last piece

00:16:27.350 --> 00:16:30.710 align:middle line:10%
of this great puzzle.

00:16:30.710 --> 00:16:34.130 align:middle line:10%
That December 18th, the
President of the United States

00:16:34.130 --> 00:16:37.490 align:middle line:10%
signed a memorandum officially
creating the United States

It is a unified combat command

00:16:45.300 --> 00:16:48.720 align:middle line:10%
It was originally
created in September 1985

to coordinate the use and
protection of outer space

00:16:56.270 --> 00:16:58.190 align:middle line:10%
The mission of the

00:16:58.190 --> 00:17:00.440 align:middle line:10%
to discourage
aggression and conflict,

00:17:00.440 --> 00:17:03.770 align:middle line:10%
as well as to defend the freedom

00:17:03.770 --> 00:17:05.849 align:middle line:10%
and allied countries.

00:17:05.849 --> 00:17:07.980 align:middle line:84%
However, several
observers consider

00:17:07.980 --> 00:17:10.550 align:middle line:84%
that it is really about
the militarization

00:17:10.550 --> 00:17:14.160 align:middle line:84%
of the outer space
of our planet.

00:17:14.160 --> 00:17:16.130 align:middle line:84%
The start of a career
that could lead

00:17:16.130 --> 00:17:21.050 align:middle line:84%
us to place nuclear
weapons off planet Earth.

00:17:21.050 --> 00:17:23.780 align:middle line:84%
This is the document that
President Donald Trump

00:17:23.780 --> 00:17:25.940 align:middle line:84%
sent to the
Secretary of Defense,

00:17:25.940 --> 00:17:28.220 align:middle line:84%

combat unit in space.

00:17:32.390 --> 00:17:37.250 align:middle line:84%
And authorizes its publication
on December 18, 2018.

00:17:45.990 --> 00:17:48.210 align:middle line:84%
While Russian president
Vladimir Putin

00:17:48.210 --> 00:17:50.670 align:middle line:84%
warned in a speech
on October 11th

00:17:50.670 --> 00:17:53.400 align:middle line:84%
that Russia will respond
to the United States

00:17:53.400 --> 00:17:56.490 align:middle line:84%
by creating new
weapons for space,

00:17:56.490 --> 00:18:00.120 align:middle line:84%
he considered it very dangerous
to place weapons in near Earth

00:18:00.120 --> 00:18:01.020 align:middle line:90%
space.

00:18:01.020 --> 00:18:03.180 align:middle line:84%
He said it was
still more dangerous

00:18:03.180 --> 00:18:06.270 align:middle line:84%
than intermediate range
missiles in Europe.

00:18:06.270 --> 00:18:09.180 align:middle line:84%
This situation, according
to Vladimir Putin,

00:18:09.180 --> 00:18:11.850 align:middle line:90%
will worsen global security.

00:18:11.850 --> 00:18:16.250 align:middle line:84%
The time will come when weapons
will be placed on countries.

00:18:16.250 --> 00:18:18.150 align:middle line:84%
The time for
missiles to hit Earth

00:18:18.150 --> 00:18:21.600 align:middle line:84%
will be between five
and eight minutes.

00:18:21.600 --> 00:18:25.020 align:middle line:84%
The possibility of an
error is a very feasible,

00:18:25.020 --> 00:18:26.820 align:middle line:84%
according to the
Russian president.

00:18:26.820 --> 00:18:33.330 align:middle line:90%


00:18:33.330 --> 00:18:36.240 align:middle line:84%
>> It is now evident that
the presence of the giant

00:18:36.240 --> 00:18:40.860 align:middle line:84%
tetrahedron over the Pentagon
and the Kremlin was a warning

00:18:40.860 --> 00:18:45.690 align:middle line:84%
about the extraordinary danger
in which humanity finds itself.

00:18:45.690 --> 00:18:48.050 align:middle line:90%
There are no coincidences.

00:18:48.050 --> 00:18:51.320 align:middle line:84%
Although very few have
realized what all means,

00:18:51.320 --> 00:18:53.810 align:middle line:84%
it is clear that
in a war there is

00:18:53.810 --> 00:18:58.160 align:middle line:84%
a presence that tries to avoid
the end of humanity and life

00:18:58.160 --> 00:18:59.330 align:middle line:90%
as we know it.

00:18:59.330 --> 00:19:00.730 align:middle line:90%
