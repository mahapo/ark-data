First event is an explosion.

00:09:42.785 --> 00:09:44.045 align:middle line:90%

00:09:44.045 --> 00:09:45.940 align:middle line:90%

the debris field.

00:09:48.433 --> 00:09:49.475 align:middle line:90%

of the bodies end up here.

capsule of some sort,

about the size of a
Volkswagen Beetle,

00:10:01.150 --> 00:10:05.220 align:middle line:84%

the same place where Mac Brazel

00:10:13.720 --> 00:10:17.470 align:middle line:84%
discovered the alien ship debris
that would have spread after

00:10:17.470 --> 00:10:18.700 align:middle line:90%
the impact.

00:10:18.700 --> 00:10:22.750 align:middle line:84%
Then, just two days later, Mr.
Brazel found a new crash site.

00:10:22.750 --> 00:10:25.600 align:middle line:84%
However, he didn't find any
parts of the craft there

00:10:25.600 --> 00:10:28.360 align:middle line:90%
but did find some alien corpses.

00:10:28.360 --> 00:10:32.650 align:middle line:84%
What he saw and discovered
there affected his life forever.

00:10:32.650 --> 00:10:34.890 align:middle line:90%
The smells, the dead bodies--

00:10:34.890 --> 00:10:38.300 align:middle line:84%
an impression that
would never leave him.

00:10:38.300 --> 00:10:42.460 align:middle line:84%
>> I'm sure that after
he found the remains,

00:10:42.460 --> 00:10:46.540 align:middle line:84%
that's when he realized
this was something that--

00:10:46.540 --> 00:10:50.170 align:middle line:84%
and it really shook him to
the core because he kept

00:10:50.170 --> 00:10:54.900 align:middle line:84%
describing, even afterwards,
that as he mentioned

00:10:54.900 --> 00:10:58.360 align:middle line:84%
in the presence of his
granddaughter that you

00:10:58.360 --> 00:11:01.450 align:middle line:84%
didn't want to see
what I saw out there.

00:11:01.450 --> 00:11:05.246 align:middle line:84%
You didn't want to be
there because it just--

00:11:05.246 --> 00:11:08.020 align:middle line:84%
again, it was something
that affected him

00:11:08.020 --> 00:11:09.820 align:middle line:90%
for the rest of his life.

00:11:09.820 --> 00:11:12.160 align:middle line:84%

accompanied by
Timothy "Dee" Proctor,

00:11:14.380 --> 00:11:18.010 align:middle line:84%
the son of one of his neighbors,
found remains of beings that

00:11:18.010 --> 00:11:19.930 align:middle line:90%
were not of this planet.

00:11:19.930 --> 00:11:22.280 align:middle line:84%
Timothy took years
to reveal the story.

about to have some surgery that

00:11:31.300 --> 00:11:36.200 align:middle line:84%
was very serious, her son
stopped by the ranch house one

00:11:36.200 --> 00:11:40.880 align:middle line:84%
particular day and said mom,
I'd like to show you something.

00:11:40.880 --> 00:11:43.640 align:middle line:84%
And they got in
his pickup truck,

00:11:43.640 --> 00:11:46.030 align:middle line:84%
and he drove her
out into this area.

00:11:46.030 --> 00:11:48.470 align:middle line:84%
And they didn't go to
the debris field site.

00:11:48.470 --> 00:11:52.460 align:middle line:84%
They came on top of this
ridge, on top this bluff.

00:11:52.460 --> 00:11:56.690 align:middle line:84%
And they stepped out, and
all he would say was mom,

00:11:56.690 --> 00:12:01.470 align:middle line:84%
this is where Mac
found something else.

00:12:01.470 --> 00:12:06.620 align:middle line:84%
There was another-- there
was a young boy, another boy,

00:12:06.620 --> 00:12:08.480 align:middle line:90%
with Brazel at the time.

00:12:08.480 --> 00:12:12.770 align:middle line:84%
His name is Sydney
Jack-- they called him--

00:12:12.770 --> 00:12:14.390 align:middle line:90%
Wright.

00:12:14.390 --> 00:12:18.170 align:middle line:84%
And he admitted that
he was with Brazel

00:12:18.170 --> 00:12:20.900 align:middle line:84%
when they found the
bodies a couple of miles,

00:12:20.900 --> 00:12:24.830 align:middle line:84%
as he put it, from
the debris field.

00:12:24.830 --> 00:12:27.860 align:middle line:84%
>> One further testimony
supports this story.

00:12:27.860 --> 00:12:32.240 align:middle line:84%
Mac Brazel was interviewed by
Frank Joyce on a radio show.

00:12:32.240 --> 00:12:34.610 align:middle line:84%
Even in his
retirement, Mr. Brazel

00:12:34.610 --> 00:12:41.143 align:middle line:84%
revealed additional information
about what happened in 1947.

00:12:41.143 --> 00:12:42.310 align:middle line:90%
>> He was talking to Brazel.

00:12:42.310 --> 00:12:46.190 align:middle line:84%
And Brazel kept talking
about, it was just horrible.

00:12:46.190 --> 00:12:48.300 align:middle line:90%
It was just horrible.

00:12:48.300 --> 00:12:53.760 align:middle line:84%
And Joyce kept asking him, well,
what are you talking about?

00:12:53.760 --> 00:12:55.050 align:middle line:90%
And it was horrible--

00:12:55.050 --> 00:12:56.980 align:middle line:90%
Brazel kept going on.

00:12:56.980 --> 00:13:01.050 align:middle line:84%
And Joyce would say,
are you suggesting

00:13:01.050 --> 00:13:02.370 align:middle line:90%
there was something else?

00:13:02.370 --> 00:13:07.530 align:middle line:84%
And Joyce then said, well,
are you talking about bodies?

00:13:07.530 --> 00:13:11.250 align:middle line:84%
And Brazel kept going on-- you
wouldn't believe the smell.

00:13:11.250 --> 00:13:13.830 align:middle line:90%
The stench was terrible.

00:13:13.830 --> 00:13:14.770 align:middle line:90%
And Joyce suggests--

00:13:14.770 --> 00:13:15.570 align:middle line:90%


00:13:15.570 --> 00:13:18.600 align:middle line:84%
Well, you know they're
launching those rockets

00:13:18.600 --> 00:13:20.520 align:middle line:90%
over at White Sands?

00:13:20.520 --> 00:13:22.425 align:middle line:90%
Maybe they launched a monkey.

00:13:22.425 --> 00:13:24.080 align:middle line:90%


00:13:24.080 --> 00:13:29.850 align:middle line:84%
And Brazel fired back, they
weren't any damn monkeys.

00:13:29.850 --> 00:13:31.200 align:middle line:90%
They weren't human.

00:13:31.200 --> 00:13:32.145 align:middle line:90%
So--

00:13:32.145 --> 00:13:33.540 align:middle line:90%
>> And they were here?

00:13:33.540 --> 00:13:34.920 align:middle line:90%
And they were found here?

00:13:34.920 --> 00:13:35.950 align:middle line:90%

00:13:37.080 --> 00:13:37.880 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

What did the authorities
do with them?

00:13:44.870 --> 00:13:47.840 align:middle line:84%
A ship crashed on the
property of the Foster Ranch

00:13:47.840 --> 00:13:50.480 align:middle line:90%
on July 4, 1947.

00:13:50.480 --> 00:13:54.950 align:middle line:84%
There, Mac Brazel discovered
the remains of the alien saucer.

00:13:54.950 --> 00:13:57.830 align:middle line:84%
The previous night, there
had been a strong storm,

00:13:57.830 --> 00:14:01.340 align:middle line:84%
and some considered that the
ship had been hit by lightning

00:14:01.340 --> 00:14:03.800 align:middle line:90%
and had fallen to earth.

00:14:03.800 --> 00:14:06.440 align:middle line:84%
Mac grabbed a few
pieces of the ship

00:14:06.440 --> 00:14:08.540 align:middle line:84%
and took them to
Roswell to deliver them

00:14:08.540 --> 00:14:09.950 align:middle line:90%
to the authorities.

00:14:09.950 --> 00:14:15.710 align:middle line:90%
That was July 5, 1947.

>> That is where Brazel,
the first evening after he

00:14:20.120 --> 00:14:21.440 align:middle line:90%
discovered the debris--

00:14:21.440 --> 00:14:23.840 align:middle line:84%
he went back with
his pickup truck.

00:14:23.840 --> 00:14:28.880 align:middle line:84%
And he either loaded it
into the box or dragged it--

00:14:28.880 --> 00:14:31.100 align:middle line:90%
the largest piece.

00:14:31.100 --> 00:14:35.120 align:middle line:84%

Sunday, July 6, 1947,

00:14:35.120 --> 00:14:39.110 align:middle line:84%

notify the authorities of what

00:14:39.110 --> 00:14:40.370 align:middle line:90%
he had found.

00:14:40.370 --> 00:14:44.060 align:middle line:84%
Once there, he went to see the
local sheriff, Sheriff George

00:14:44.060 --> 00:14:46.550 align:middle line:84%
Wilcox, who, in
turn, gave notice

00:14:46.550 --> 00:14:49.190 align:middle line:84%
to the military authorities
of the Roswell air base

00:14:49.190 --> 00:14:52.460 align:middle line:84%
in New Mexico that strange
remains of an aircraft

00:14:52.460 --> 00:14:56.180 align:middle line:84%
had been discovered on
Mr. Brazel's property.

00:14:56.180 --> 00:14:59.540 align:middle line:84%
Colonel William Blanchard
sent two military intelligence

00:14:59.540 --> 00:15:02.060 align:middle line:84%
officers to
investigate and recover

00:15:02.060 --> 00:15:05.750 align:middle line:84%
any strange objects that had
been scattered in the field.

00:15:05.750 --> 00:15:09.585 align:middle line:84%
They arrived at this small
shelter on July 6, 1947,

00:15:09.585 --> 00:15:10.385 align:middle line:90%
in the evening.

00:15:10.385 --> 00:15:13.250 align:middle line:90%


00:15:13.250 --> 00:15:16.780 align:middle line:84%
>> We're standing in front
of the old ranch house.

00:15:16.780 --> 00:15:18.490 align:middle line:90%
It was called-- still is--

00:15:18.490 --> 00:15:20.060 align:middle line:90%
the Hines House.

00:15:20.060 --> 00:15:24.920 align:middle line:84%
And this is where when Mac
Brazel led the two intelligence

00:15:24.920 --> 00:15:29.150 align:middle line:84%
officers, Major Jesse Marcell
and Captain Sheridan Cabot,

00:15:29.150 --> 00:15:31.880 align:middle line:84%
out to investigate
the debris field.

of intelligence for the 509th

00:15:36.050 --> 00:15:39.230 align:middle line:10%
Bombers Group in Roswell,
brought some of the materials

00:15:39.230 --> 00:15:42.530 align:middle line:10%
back to his base for inspection.

00:15:42.530 --> 00:15:47.720 align:middle line:84%
>> And the very night that
Marcell would return back from

00:15:47.720 --> 00:15:53.240 align:middle line:84%
the debris field with his
'42 Buick convertible full

00:15:53.240 --> 00:15:56.960 align:middle line:84%
of debris, full of wreckage--
the back seat, the trunk--

00:15:56.960 --> 00:16:00.170 align:middle line:84%
he would wake his son,
Jess Jr., and wife up--

00:16:00.170 --> 00:16:02.000 align:middle line:90%
take them into the kitchen.

00:16:02.000 --> 00:16:03.480 align:middle line:90%
And there, he had wreckage.

00:16:03.480 --> 00:16:06.820 align:middle line:84%
He had debris scattered all
over the kitchen floor--

00:16:06.820 --> 00:16:10.160 align:middle line:84%
wanted them to see
it before he took it

00:16:10.160 --> 00:16:12.440 align:middle line:90%
all the way to the base.

00:16:12.440 --> 00:16:19.100 align:middle line:84%
And it was there that Jesse Jr.,
examining one of the pieces,

00:16:19.100 --> 00:16:24.360 align:middle line:84%
noticed some of the
hieroglyphic-like symbology

00:16:24.360 --> 00:16:28.760 align:middle line:90%
and immediately observed that--

00:16:28.760 --> 00:16:30.690 align:middle line:84%
you know, noticed that
this was something

00:16:30.690 --> 00:16:35.700 align:middle line:84%
that his father had never seen
anything like this before.

00:16:35.700 --> 00:16:38.130 align:middle line:84%
And his father kept talking
about pieces of a flying

00:16:38.130 --> 00:16:41.550 align:middle line:90%
saucer, a flying saucer crash.

00:16:41.550 --> 00:16:44.310 align:middle line:10%
>> Another serviceman,
Colonel William Blanchard,

00:16:44.310 --> 00:16:47.490 align:middle line:10%
commander in chief of the
Roswell military base,

00:16:47.490 --> 00:16:49.680 align:middle line:10%
was also a witness.

00:16:49.680 --> 00:16:51.900 align:middle line:84%
Years later, his
daughter would reveal

00:16:51.900 --> 00:16:56.070 align:middle line:84%
what happened that night
in 1947, in his house where

00:16:56.070 --> 00:16:59.360 align:middle line:90%
the Blanchard family lived.

00:16:59.360 --> 00:17:05.630 align:middle line:84%
>> Blanchard's daughter, Dale,
describes that when her father

00:17:05.630 --> 00:17:09.920 align:middle line:84%
came home late that
night, that first night,

00:17:09.920 --> 00:17:15.000 align:middle line:84%
that he was beside himself
for being a big man--

00:17:15.000 --> 00:17:16.700 align:middle line:90%
he played football.

00:17:16.700 --> 00:17:18.910 align:middle line:90%
And there were little people.

00:17:18.910 --> 00:17:20.390 align:middle line:90%
There were little men.

00:17:20.390 --> 00:17:22.220 align:middle line:90%
And they weren't from here.

00:17:22.220 --> 00:17:26.420 align:middle line:84%
And then he would say that
they weren't from this earth.

00:17:26.420 --> 00:17:31.370 align:middle line:84%
So the family described how
when Blanchard came home

00:17:31.370 --> 00:17:34.640 align:middle line:84%
that this was something
very unsettling,

00:17:34.640 --> 00:17:39.120 align:middle line:84%
something that, again, defied
conventional explanation.

00:17:39.120 --> 00:17:41.190 align:middle line:10%
[SPEAKING SPANISH]

00:17:41.190 --> 00:17:50.070 align:middle line:90%


00:17:50.070 --> 00:17:52.560 align:middle line:84%
>> This is the area that
the military would come

00:17:52.560 --> 00:17:55.950 align:middle line:90%
to and spend about three days--

00:17:55.950 --> 00:18:01.320 align:middle line:84%
50 to 60 men on hands and
knees, shoulder to shoulder,

00:18:01.320 --> 00:18:03.660 align:middle line:90%
picking up every last piece.

00:18:03.660 --> 00:18:06.810 align:middle line:84%
As one of the MPs
said to us, they

00:18:06.810 --> 00:18:11.380 align:middle line:84%
were told if doesn't
move, pick it up.

00:18:11.380 --> 00:18:13.920 align:middle line:84%
And so there were
trucks, and they

00:18:13.920 --> 00:18:17.550 align:middle line:84%
would take sacks,
over their shoulders,

00:18:17.550 --> 00:18:19.030 align:middle line:90%
full of the material.

00:18:19.030 --> 00:18:22.200 align:middle line:84%
>> Why they had to pick
every single piece?

00:18:22.200 --> 00:18:26.580 align:middle line:84%
>> Because they realized they
had something extraordinary.

00:18:26.580 --> 00:18:28.920 align:middle line:84%
It was something beyond
their comprehension,

00:18:28.920 --> 00:18:31.740 align:middle line:84%
and they wanted to
make sure that they

00:18:31.740 --> 00:18:38.768 align:middle line:84%
had every possible piece, not
only that any outside people

00:18:38.768 --> 00:18:39.810 align:middle line:90%
would possibly discover--

00:18:39.810 --> 00:18:40.590 align:middle line:90%
>> Like you.

00:18:40.590 --> 00:18:41.390 align:middle line:90%
>> Like us.

00:18:41.390 --> 00:18:44.430 align:middle line:84%
[CHUCKLES] But at
that time, there

00:18:44.430 --> 00:18:47.610 align:middle line:84%
were a lot of Soviet
spies, especially

00:18:47.610 --> 00:18:50.070 align:middle line:84%
given that the first atomic
bomb was detonated just

00:18:50.070 --> 00:18:51.970 align:middle line:90%
to the west of here.

00:18:51.970 --> 00:18:53.580 align:middle line:84%
And so as a result,
they were also

00:18:53.580 --> 00:18:57.730 align:middle line:84%
making sure that none of
it fell into enemy hands.

00:18:57.730 --> 00:18:58.530 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:18:58.530 --> 00:19:01.770 align:middle line:84%
>> Everything that was
recovered at the crash site,

00:19:01.770 --> 00:19:04.950 align:middle line:84%
all the parts and bodies,
were transferred by the United

00:19:04.950 --> 00:19:10.980 align:middle line:84%
States Army to the P-3 hangar
of Building 84, which, in 1947,

00:19:10.980 --> 00:19:14.900 align:middle line:90%
was known as the Black Hangar.

00:19:14.900 --> 00:19:19.580 align:middle line:84%
>> This is where we taxi the
aircraft to load up certain

00:19:19.580 --> 00:19:20.820 align:middle line:90%
cargo.

00:19:20.820 --> 00:19:25.070 align:middle line:84%
This is where it all
happened, this very hangar.

00:19:25.070 --> 00:19:28.940 align:middle line:84%
This is where they
took the remains

00:19:28.940 --> 00:19:32.810 align:middle line:84%
of the ship and the bodies that
were recovered north of Roswell

00:19:32.810 --> 00:19:35.210 align:middle line:90%
in July of 1947.

00:19:35.210 --> 00:19:38.030 align:middle line:84%
>> In this hangar, where the
atomic bomber planes from

00:19:38.030 --> 00:19:41.930 align:middle line:84%
the Second World War were kept,
bodies of alien beings were

00:19:41.930 --> 00:19:46.550 align:middle line:84%
stored and examined, bodies
unlike any humans ever seen

00:19:46.550 --> 00:19:47.600 align:middle line:90%
before.

00:19:47.600 --> 00:19:50.570 align:middle line:84%
All the witnesses interviewed by
Donald Schmidt and his research

00:19:50.570 --> 00:19:52.910 align:middle line:84%
team were also there
to be interviewed.

00:19:52.910 --> 00:19:55.850 align:middle line:84%
They all claimed and
supported the same story,

00:19:55.850 --> 00:19:57.890 align:middle line:90%
that this case was authentic.

00:19:57.890 --> 00:20:00.290 align:middle line:84%
It really happened--
truths that had been

00:20:00.290 --> 00:20:03.470 align:middle line:90%
hidden for more than 60 years.

00:20:03.470 --> 00:20:08.420 align:middle line:84%
>> They saw two that were
obviously dead and one that was

00:20:08.420 --> 00:20:10.910 align:middle line:90%
alive and walking and talking.

00:20:10.910 --> 00:20:13.820 align:middle line:10%
>> He said that he went out and
found that when he got there

00:20:13.820 --> 00:20:18.830 align:middle line:10%
that he observed the crash
site, a circular-type ship crash

00:20:18.830 --> 00:20:19.930 align:middle line:10%
site.

00:20:19.930 --> 00:20:21.830 align:middle line:84%
And there was debris
strewn everywhere

00:20:21.830 --> 00:20:25.890 align:middle line:84%
and that he had
found three bodies.

00:20:25.890 --> 00:20:27.680 align:middle line:90%
They had large heads on them.

00:20:27.680 --> 00:20:29.690 align:middle line:84%
And at least one of
them was still alive

00:20:29.690 --> 00:20:32.390 align:middle line:84%
when they brought
him back to the base.

00:20:32.390 --> 00:20:34.400 align:middle line:10%
>> He said it happened.

00:20:34.400 --> 00:20:35.990 align:middle line:10%
I was out there.

00:20:35.990 --> 00:20:37.880 align:middle line:10%
I saw the crash site.

00:20:37.880 --> 00:20:39.820 align:middle line:10%
I saw the spacecraft.

00:20:39.820 --> 00:20:41.960 align:middle line:10%
And I saw the grays.

00:20:41.960 --> 00:20:45.680 align:middle line:10%
And "the grays" was in reference
to the color of the skin.

00:20:45.680 --> 00:20:47.880 align:middle line:84%
>> And some described,
for example,

00:20:47.880 --> 00:20:52.250 align:middle line:84%
not only seeing areas where
bodies were laid out with

00:20:52.250 --> 00:20:56.300 align:middle line:84%
a canvas tarpaulin covering
everything but the heads,

00:20:56.300 --> 00:21:00.460 align:middle line:84%
but then off to the side,
others would describe seeing

00:21:00.460 --> 00:21:04.890 align:middle line:84%
an egg-shaped object, a pod,
a capsule about the size

00:21:04.890 --> 00:21:06.500 align:middle line:90%
of a car.

00:21:06.500 --> 00:21:09.650 align:middle line:84%
And then others would describe
seeing areas of nothing

00:21:09.650 --> 00:21:11.630 align:middle line:90%
but wreckage scattered.

00:21:11.630 --> 00:21:14.030 align:middle line:84%
Because they were
actually attempting

00:21:14.030 --> 00:21:18.140 align:middle line:84%
to reassemble, almost like
a crash investigation,

00:21:18.140 --> 00:21:22.120 align:middle line:90%
portions of this unknown object.

00:21:22.120 --> 00:21:25.590 align:middle line:84%
>> The materials classified in
this hangar were moved to Fort

00:21:25.590 --> 00:21:30.820 align:middle line:84%
Worth, Texas on a flight that
left this operation center.

00:21:30.820 --> 00:21:37.100 align:middle line:84%
>> In in 1947, the very first
flight that transported actual

00:21:37.100 --> 00:21:42.470 align:middle line:84%
wreckage from the crash site
came through this building,

00:21:42.470 --> 00:21:44.730 align:middle line:84%
through this
operations building.

00:21:44.730 --> 00:21:47.330 align:middle line:84%
And that would have been
Major Jesse Marcell.

00:21:47.330 --> 00:21:50.900 align:middle line:84%
And the base commander,
Colonel William Blanchard,

00:21:50.900 --> 00:21:54.710 align:middle line:84%
was observed in this
building as the men escorted,

00:21:54.710 --> 00:22:01.700 align:middle line:84%
in boxes, open boxes, actual
replica, as far as remnants,

00:22:01.700 --> 00:22:03.200 align:middle line:90%
from the crash--

00:22:03.200 --> 00:22:05.300 align:middle line:84%
and came through a
hallway and there

00:22:05.300 --> 00:22:13.250 align:middle line:84%
was a B-29 that taxied up,
which was called Dave's Dream.

00:22:13.250 --> 00:22:15.620 align:middle line:10%
>> The bodies of the
alien beings were moved

00:22:15.620 --> 00:22:17.300 align:middle line:10%
to the restricted area.

00:22:17.300 --> 00:22:20.300 align:middle line:10%
Joseph Montoya, the vice
governor of New Mexico,

00:22:20.300 --> 00:22:23.870 align:middle line:10%
observed these amazing beings
recovered by the United States

00:22:23.870 --> 00:22:25.010 align:middle line:10%
Army.

00:22:25.010 --> 00:22:26.670 align:middle line:90%
>> Was beside himself--

00:22:26.670 --> 00:22:27.650 align:middle line:90%
he was distraught.

00:22:27.650 --> 00:22:29.120 align:middle line:90%
He was upset.

00:22:29.120 --> 00:22:32.450 align:middle line:84%
And all at once, he
went, they weren't human.

00:22:32.450 --> 00:22:33.530 align:middle line:90%
They weren't human.

00:22:33.530 --> 00:22:34.850 align:middle line:90%
You won't believe it.

00:22:34.850 --> 00:22:36.780 align:middle line:90%
You won't believe it.

00:22:36.780 --> 00:22:39.050 align:middle line:84%
And then later,
he would describe

00:22:39.050 --> 00:22:42.470 align:middle line:84%
that he was taken
into the hangar,

00:22:42.470 --> 00:22:46.340 align:middle line:84%
and he was shown what he
thought were children.

00:22:46.340 --> 00:22:49.400 align:middle line:84%
And he heard one
of them moaning.

00:22:49.400 --> 00:22:53.570 align:middle line:84%
And its leg was rocking, its
knee rocking back and forth.

00:22:53.570 --> 00:22:55.250 align:middle line:90%
It was alive.

00:22:55.250 --> 00:22:59.060 align:middle line:90%
And he saw that it wasn't human.

00:22:59.060 --> 00:23:01.880 align:middle line:90%
And he became immediately upset.

00:23:01.880 --> 00:23:06.380 align:middle line:84%
And get me out of here-- get
me away from here right away.

00:23:06.380 --> 00:23:10.580 align:middle line:84%
And that's when he called for
his friends to pick him up.

00:23:10.580 --> 00:23:13.910 align:middle line:84%
And he would always
warn them afterwards,

00:23:13.910 --> 00:23:17.210 align:middle line:84%
if you ever repeat
what I've told you,

00:23:17.210 --> 00:23:19.130 align:middle line:90%
I will say you're a liar.

00:23:19.130 --> 00:23:21.060 align:middle line:90%
I will say you're lying.

00:23:21.060 --> 00:23:24.740 align:middle line:84%
And he would also warn them
that I can't stop the FBI.

00:23:24.740 --> 00:23:28.820 align:middle line:84%
I can't stop the government
from hurting you.

00:23:28.820 --> 00:23:32.370 align:middle line:84%
So he warned them never
to talk about this again.

00:23:32.370 --> 00:23:35.660 align:middle line:84%
So it was after he had
passed away that they finally

00:23:35.660 --> 00:23:40.430 align:middle line:84%
started to confide to us and
repeat what he had originally

00:23:40.430 --> 00:23:44.420 align:middle line:84%
told them, that
they weren't human.

00:23:44.420 --> 00:23:47.240 align:middle line:84%
>> Today, thanks to witnesses
who saw what happened

00:23:47.240 --> 00:23:50.780 align:middle line:84%
in the hangar, as well as in the
hospital and the transferring

00:23:50.780 --> 00:23:53.990 align:middle line:84%
of those bodies to the
Wright-Patterson military base,

00:23:53.990 --> 00:23:56.300 align:middle line:90%
we know what really happened.

00:23:56.300 --> 00:23:59.360 align:middle line:84%
The witnesses decided to
speak before they died

00:23:59.360 --> 00:24:03.520 align:middle line:84%
and leave their testimony
for the history books.

00:24:03.520 --> 00:24:07.840 align:middle line:84%
>> One of our first 10
witnesses, Eli Benjamin,

00:24:07.840 --> 00:24:11.560 align:middle line:84%
who we describe in our
book, "Witness to Roswell,"

00:24:11.560 --> 00:24:16.900 align:middle line:84%
described how they were called
and assigned to guard duty over

00:24:16.900 --> 00:24:20.140 align:middle line:90%
at the hangar, Building 84.

00:24:20.140 --> 00:24:23.650 align:middle line:84%
And then they were
instructed to escort,

00:24:23.650 --> 00:24:26.830 align:middle line:84%
in ambulance trucks,
a number of gurneys,

00:24:26.830 --> 00:24:32.320 align:middle line:84%
transporting a number of
bodies to this very location.

00:24:32.320 --> 00:24:35.050 align:middle line:84%
It was there, as
they were unloading,

00:24:35.050 --> 00:24:40.420 align:middle line:84%
most likely from this area
right here, that one of the MPs

00:24:40.420 --> 00:24:44.590 align:middle line:84%
stepped on one of the
sheets, pulling it away

00:24:44.590 --> 00:24:48.490 align:middle line:84%
from one of the bodies
on one of the gurneys.

00:24:48.490 --> 00:24:50.140 align:middle line:90%
And it moved.

00:24:50.140 --> 00:24:52.300 align:middle line:90%
And the eyes opened.

00:24:52.300 --> 00:24:56.260 align:middle line:84%
And he saw that, clearly,
you know, it wasn't human,

00:24:56.260 --> 00:24:59.320 align:middle line:84%
that it was something, as
he describes to this day,

00:24:59.320 --> 00:25:00.400 align:middle line:90%
haunts him.

00:25:00.400 --> 00:25:03.220 align:middle line:84%
He gets very emotional
when he talks about it

00:25:03.220 --> 00:25:07.330 align:middle line:84%
because he can't forget the
face and that clearly it

00:25:07.330 --> 00:25:10.430 align:middle line:84%
was something beyond this
planet, beyond our existence

00:25:10.430 --> 00:25:11.230 align:middle line:90%
here.

00:25:11.230 --> 00:25:13.590 align:middle line:90%
>> Were these creatures hurt?

00:25:13.590 --> 00:25:18.220 align:middle line:84%
>> Some were described,
even at the crash site,

00:25:18.220 --> 00:25:21.670 align:middle line:84%
as being burned,
as being mangled.

00:25:21.670 --> 00:25:27.300 align:middle line:84%
Some were described as
uninjured, almost peaceful,

00:25:27.300 --> 00:25:33.820 align:middle line:84%
as in repose, as though they
were very serene even in dying.

00:25:33.820 --> 00:25:38.380 align:middle line:84%
And the surviving one was
described, at some point,

00:25:38.380 --> 00:25:44.440 align:middle line:84%
even walking on its own or
being brought in on a gurney.

00:25:44.440 --> 00:25:49.180 align:middle line:84%
And then as the
base administrator

00:25:49.180 --> 00:25:55.780 align:middle line:84%
who worked in the hospital, his
private secretary, Miriam Bush,

00:25:55.780 --> 00:26:00.250 align:middle line:84%
described that when she was
taken into an examination room

00:26:00.250 --> 00:26:05.240 align:middle line:84%
here at this hospital
facility, she was shocked.

00:26:05.240 --> 00:26:07.360 align:middle line:84%
She thought they
were children, again,

00:26:07.360 --> 00:26:11.050 align:middle line:84%
based on the size of the
outline under the sheets

00:26:11.050 --> 00:26:12.490 align:middle line:90%
on the gurneys.

00:26:12.490 --> 00:26:15.100 align:middle line:84%
And then she saw
one of them move.

00:26:15.100 --> 00:26:19.720 align:middle line:84%
And she saw, again, the larger
head and the larger eyes.

00:26:19.720 --> 00:26:23.560 align:middle line:84%
And it was something that
affected her as well,

00:26:23.560 --> 00:26:26.470 align:middle line:90%
for the rest of her life.

00:26:26.470 --> 00:26:29.500 align:middle line:84%
>> From the military hospital,
telephone calls were made

00:26:29.500 --> 00:26:32.290 align:middle line:84%
to the only funeral
home in Roswell,

00:26:32.290 --> 00:26:36.890 align:middle line:84%
the Ballard Funeral Home, a
call that was made 64 years ago.

00:26:36.890 --> 00:26:39.250 align:middle line:84%
Glenn Dennis took
the call but did not

00:26:39.250 --> 00:26:44.010 align:middle line:84%
understand the unusual
request made by the Army.

00:26:44.010 --> 00:26:48.690 align:middle line:84%
>> And Glenn's story was
that at first the calls were

00:26:48.690 --> 00:26:53.250 align:middle line:84%
as to the availability
of child-sized caskets.

00:26:53.250 --> 00:26:56.540 align:middle line:84%
Do you have any
children's caskets?

00:26:56.540 --> 00:26:58.770 align:middle line:90%
OK, that was believable.

00:26:58.770 --> 00:27:01.530 align:middle line:84%
But then there were
follow-up calls

00:27:01.530 --> 00:27:05.610 align:middle line:84%
as to what type
of chemicals could

00:27:05.610 --> 00:27:13.050 align:middle line:84%
be used for the preservation
of bodily tissue and bodily

that he shouldn't be there.

preliminary examinations were

00:27:54.510 --> 00:27:58.170 align:middle line:84%
done at the funeral home and
at the military hospital.

00:27:58.170 --> 00:28:00.660 align:middle line:84%

00:28:00.660 --> 00:28:03.180 align:middle line:84%
at other military
facilities too.

beings of unknown origin.

that the United States

00:28:26.610 --> 00:28:28.480 align:middle line:90%
was in grave danger.

The news had to be
stopped and controlled,

kept in the strictest
secrecy or, otherwise, it

00:28:34.860 --> 00:28:36.315 align:middle line:90%
