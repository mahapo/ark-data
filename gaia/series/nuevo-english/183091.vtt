>> Gaia presents "Nuevo"
with Jaime Maussan.

00:00:21.950 --> 00:00:27.800 align:middle line:90%


00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:30.650 align:middle line:10%
>> Today on "Nuevo,"
a story that, if true,

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:34.340 align:middle line:10%
would be the most extraordinary
discovery of our times.

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:37.600 align:middle line:10%
According to three witnesses,
teleportation to Mars

00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:42.560 align:middle line:10%
is not just possible, but it is
an unexpected reality that has

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:45.760 align:middle line:10%
been used for almost 30 years.

00:00:45.760 --> 00:00:47.260 align:middle line:84%
>> How could we
possibly be on Mars?

00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:49.380 align:middle line:84%
And nobody would believe me if
I said I'm invited to go to Mars

00:00:49.380 --> 00:00:51.047 align:middle line:84%
and that there's
serious technologies,

00:00:51.047 --> 00:00:52.880 align:middle line:84%
and the people that are
behind recruiting me

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:58.400 align:middle line:84%
have incredible technologies and
a serious mission to get there.

00:00:58.400 --> 00:01:01.610 align:middle line:84%
>> As a six-year-old, I first
teleported with my late father,

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:04.849 align:middle line:84%
Raymond F. Basiago, who was
one of the project principals.

00:01:04.849 --> 00:01:07.220 align:middle line:84%
And beginning in
the very beginning

00:01:07.220 --> 00:01:09.950 align:middle line:84%
of the summer of
1981, Courtney Hunt

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:12.560 align:middle line:84%
was asking me a question I
really didn't want to be asked.

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:16.970 align:middle line:84%
And that question was, so, tell
me, do you want to go to Mars?

00:01:16.970 --> 00:01:20.180 align:middle line:84%
And then in the late June of
1981, I said, why should I go?

00:01:20.180 --> 00:01:22.550 align:middle line:84%
Why are you asking
me to go to Mars?

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:24.890 align:middle line:84%
And he said, because the
survival of human life

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:26.030 align:middle line:90%
depends on it.

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:27.960 align:middle line:84%
I'm speaking out
now for two reasons.

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:29.960 align:middle line:84%
One is we're going to be
needing this technology

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:31.020 align:middle line:90%
to save our civilization.

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:33.500 align:middle line:84%
So I think that's
important a reason enough.

00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:36.380 align:middle line:84%
People, I think, also have
a human right, a birthright,

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:39.110 align:middle line:84%
to a true telling of the natural
history of the solar system

00:01:39.110 --> 00:01:40.170 align:middle line:90%
that we inhabit.

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:44.660 align:middle line:84%
>> Is not this dangerous for
you to speak about all this?

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:47.878 align:middle line:84%
>> Yes, and I've realized
since the inception

00:01:47.878 --> 00:01:50.420 align:middle line:84%
of my investigation that I might
be assassinated for carrying

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:53.340 align:middle line:84%
out my investigation of
such a sensitive topic.

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:55.970 align:middle line:84%
But that's a risk that
I'm willing to take.

00:01:55.970 --> 00:01:58.190 align:middle line:84%
Teleportation has been
used since at least

00:01:58.190 --> 00:02:01.860 align:middle line:84%
around 1980 to place
human personnel on Mars.

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:03.000 align:middle line:90%
Why do I know that?

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:05.180 align:middle line:84%
I know that because
I participated

00:02:05.180 --> 00:02:07.700 align:middle line:84%
in later activities in which
that is what we were doing.

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:09.919 align:middle line:84%
When I was trained
on Project Pegasus,

00:02:09.919 --> 00:02:13.460 align:middle line:84%
that they were utilizing 140
American school children.

00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:15.380 align:middle line:84%
>> Was it dangerous
for the children?

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:18.380 align:middle line:84%
>> Yes, it was new, dangerous,
and experimental when we began

00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:19.190 align:middle line:90%
teleporting.

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:20.565 align:middle line:84%
So they were
actually training us

00:02:20.565 --> 00:02:22.757 align:middle line:84%
to contingency plan
for the possibility

00:02:22.757 --> 00:02:25.340 align:middle line:84%
that we might be lost in time,
which was a very fearsome thing

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:28.370 align:middle line:84%
to contemplate for those
of us in the program.

00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:30.800 align:middle line:84%
We were concerned about
literally leaving this time

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:33.060 align:middle line:90%
and being stuck in another one.

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:35.910 align:middle line:84%
>> One, they wanted to test
the mental and physical effects

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:38.206 align:middle line:90%
of teleportation on children.

00:02:38.206 --> 00:02:40.950 align:middle line:84%
Two, they had these
electro-optical devices

00:02:40.950 --> 00:02:43.110 align:middle line:84%
called chronovisors
that prompted

00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:46.650 align:middle line:84%
moving holographic images
of past and future events.

00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:49.350 align:middle line:84%
The third purpose is that
they knew that children

00:02:49.350 --> 00:02:52.005 align:middle line:84%
are exceptionally accurate
in their observations,

00:02:52.005 --> 00:02:54.630 align:middle line:84%
or at least they tend to be much
more accurate than what adults

00:02:54.630 --> 00:02:56.700 align:middle line:90%
report that they're seeing.

00:02:56.700 --> 00:02:58.860 align:middle line:84%
Their perceptions are
not influenced in the way

00:02:58.860 --> 00:03:02.310 align:middle line:84%
that adults' perceptions are by
the selection bias of what they

00:03:02.310 --> 00:03:04.050 align:middle line:90%
have previously experienced.

00:03:04.050 --> 00:03:06.150 align:middle line:84%
The fourth reason,
and that which

00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:08.010 align:middle line:84%
we were most excited
about, is they told us

00:03:08.010 --> 00:03:11.340 align:middle line:84%
that in adulthood, we would
be admitted to the US Naval

00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:14.850 align:middle line:84%
Academy at Annapolis, and that
would be used as a pretext

00:03:14.850 --> 00:03:17.310 align:middle line:84%
to involve us in future
time travel activities,

00:03:17.310 --> 00:03:19.740 align:middle line:84%
that we were being trained
to become America's

00:03:19.740 --> 00:03:23.370 align:middle line:84%
first cadre of chrononauts
in a secret program that

00:03:23.370 --> 00:03:27.090 align:middle line:84%
would run parallel to
the US space program.

00:03:27.090 --> 00:03:30.600 align:middle line:84%
>> Could Nikola Tesla's
experiments been successful?

00:03:30.600 --> 00:03:33.040 align:middle line:90%
We are convinced of that today.

00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:36.120 align:middle line:84%
We believe it is possible
to teleport a human being

00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:38.850 align:middle line:90%
successfully without injury.

00:03:38.850 --> 00:03:41.430 align:middle line:84%
We have proof that
scientists have been working

00:03:41.430 --> 00:03:44.550 align:middle line:84%
on teleportation for
at least 30 years

00:03:44.550 --> 00:03:48.220 align:middle line:84%
and have been successful
on at least two occasions.

00:03:48.220 --> 00:03:50.280 align:middle line:84%
The first was
almost 20 years ago,

00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:54.450 align:middle line:84%
when a photon was teleported
at a distance of 800 meters.

00:03:54.450 --> 00:03:57.360 align:middle line:84%
And the second
occurred in 2016, when

00:03:57.360 --> 00:04:00.030 align:middle line:84%
scientists from China
and Canada managed

00:04:00.030 --> 00:04:03.750 align:middle line:84%
to teleport photons through
fiber optics between the two

00:04:03.750 --> 00:04:04.950 align:middle line:90%
countries.

00:04:04.950 --> 00:04:08.530 align:middle line:84%
The good news is that
in 2017, the same.

00:04:08.530 --> 00:04:12.570 align:middle line:84%
scientists in China were able
to take a photon to space

00:04:12.570 --> 00:04:16.380 align:middle line:84%
and use the quantum method for
teleportation of the photon.

00:04:16.380 --> 00:04:18.870 align:middle line:84%
However, there are reports
that the United States

00:04:18.870 --> 00:04:22.350 align:middle line:84%
Army has been using
teleportation for a few decades

00:04:22.350 --> 00:04:23.280 align:middle line:90%
now.

00:04:23.280 --> 00:04:28.090 align:middle line:84%
But this has not been confirmed
by the Armed Forces of America.

00:04:28.090 --> 00:04:30.940 align:middle line:10%
We have heard that Army
scientists have managed

00:04:30.940 --> 00:04:35.020 align:middle line:10%
to teleport a fully equipped
group of nine soldiers

00:04:35.020 --> 00:04:37.900 align:middle line:10%
from the United States
Army Natick Soldier System

00:04:37.900 --> 00:04:41.860 align:middle line:10%
Center, SSC, to a
training site in Germany.

00:04:41.860 --> 00:04:45.730 align:middle line:10%
The SSC is a military
research complex installation

00:04:45.730 --> 00:04:49.390 align:middle line:10%
in Natick, Massachusetts.

00:04:49.390 --> 00:04:51.520 align:middle line:84%
The nine volunteers
had completed

00:04:51.520 --> 00:04:54.970 align:middle line:84%
individual advanced training
and were participating

00:04:54.970 --> 00:04:58.360 align:middle line:84%
in experiments using the
Doriot Environmental Climate

00:04:58.360 --> 00:05:02.350 align:middle line:84%
Chambers at SSC when
they disappeared

00:05:02.350 --> 00:05:06.130 align:middle line:84%
and moments later materialized
in the Hydra Sever Training

00:05:06.130 --> 00:05:11.370 align:middle line:84%
Site in Germany
completely unharmed.

00:05:11.370 --> 00:05:15.230 align:middle line:10%
The chambers can replicate any
climate's environment or time

00:05:15.230 --> 00:05:18.950 align:middle line:10%
zone in the world, but they
had never been used in this way

00:05:18.950 --> 00:05:21.710 align:middle line:10%
before.

00:05:21.710 --> 00:05:25.160 align:middle line:84%
Teleportation was made famous
in the "Star Trek" television

00:05:25.160 --> 00:05:27.000 align:middle line:90%
series and movies.

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:30.360 align:middle line:84%
The Army called the process
the Natick Incident,

00:05:30.360 --> 00:05:35.970 align:middle line:84%
a hypothetical way of moving
objects from place to place.

00:05:35.970 --> 00:05:38.490 align:middle line:10%
American writer Charles
Fort is reported

00:05:38.490 --> 00:05:42.050 align:middle line:10%
to have coined the
word Natick in 1931.

00:05:42.050 --> 00:05:45.420 align:middle line:84%
Natick officials were
enthusiastic about the event

00:05:45.420 --> 00:05:47.940 align:middle line:84%
that promises to one
day revolutionize

00:05:47.940 --> 00:05:50.940 align:middle line:84%
the way in which United States
troops and equipment could

00:05:50.940 --> 00:05:54.820 align:middle line:84%
be moved or transported
around the world.

00:05:54.820 --> 00:05:58.800 align:middle line:84%
It could also ultimately
make overseas bases obsolete,

00:05:58.800 --> 00:06:01.290 align:middle line:84%
as forces would
move from US soil

00:06:01.290 --> 00:06:05.770 align:middle line:84%
to remote points of conflict
in the blink of an eye.

00:06:05.770 --> 00:06:08.560 align:middle line:84%
"Nobody is more impressed
by this than I am,"

00:06:08.560 --> 00:06:12.490 align:middle line:84%
said Benjamin Storm, 61,
who manages Natick's Climate

00:06:12.490 --> 00:06:13.630 align:middle line:90%
Chambers.

00:06:13.630 --> 00:06:16.600 align:middle line:10%
One moment he was chatting
with the young soldiers,

00:06:16.600 --> 00:06:21.080 align:middle line:10%
and the next they all
vanished in the air.

00:06:21.080 --> 00:06:23.450 align:middle line:10%
The soldiers were
dressed in combat gear

00:06:23.450 --> 00:06:26.660 align:middle line:10%
for the revolutionary
experiment and supervised

00:06:26.660 --> 00:06:29.450 align:middle line:10%
by STORM and his colleagues
when they were sent

00:06:29.450 --> 00:06:31.160 align:middle line:10%
from one continent to another.

00:06:31.160 --> 00:06:34.140 align:middle line:90%


00:06:34.140 --> 00:06:36.270 align:middle line:84%
Photographs of the
chambers from the event

00:06:36.270 --> 00:06:39.660 align:middle line:84%
were captured and have
been revealed by the Army.

00:06:39.660 --> 00:06:41.670 align:middle line:84%
After thorough
medical examinations

00:06:41.670 --> 00:06:45.180 align:middle line:84%
at an Army hospital, they
flew back to the United States

00:06:45.180 --> 00:06:48.030 align:middle line:84%
and returned to their
duties at Natick.

00:06:48.030 --> 00:06:51.300 align:middle line:84%
"It's one thing to see Captain
Kirk or Mr. Spock do it

00:06:51.300 --> 00:06:53.430 align:middle line:84%
in the movies, but it's
something else when

00:06:53.430 --> 00:06:55.980 align:middle line:84%
it happens to you in
real life," said, Kelley

00:06:55.980 --> 00:06:58.680 align:middle line:84%
McCoy, one of the
teleported soldiers.

00:06:58.680 --> 00:07:01.870 align:middle line:84%
"I felt a little tingling,
and the next thing I knew,

00:07:01.870 --> 00:07:03.780 align:middle line:90%
I was in Bavaria, Germany.

00:07:03.780 --> 00:07:05.880 align:middle line:10%
I always wanted to
visit Europe, but I

00:07:05.880 --> 00:07:08.250 align:middle line:10%
thought I would go by plane."

00:07:08.250 --> 00:07:10.710 align:middle line:10%
Benjamin Storm and
other Natick researchers

00:07:10.710 --> 00:07:14.130 align:middle line:10%
are now poring over mountains
of data and research

00:07:14.130 --> 00:07:17.190 align:middle line:10%
in hopes of duplicating
teleportation.

00:07:17.190 --> 00:07:19.290 align:middle line:84%
Meanwhile, the Army
quickly established

00:07:19.290 --> 00:07:21.840 align:middle line:84%
a Teleportation
Study Task Force,

00:07:21.840 --> 00:07:24.120 align:middle line:90%
which will be based on Natick.

00:07:24.120 --> 00:07:27.300 align:middle line:84%
Leading scientists from
private industry and academia

00:07:27.300 --> 00:07:29.550 align:middle line:84%
from around the
globe are gathering

00:07:29.550 --> 00:07:33.090 align:middle line:84%
at the Client Chambers
at SSC in Massachusetts

00:07:33.090 --> 00:07:35.940 align:middle line:84%
to provide whatever
help they can.

00:07:35.940 --> 00:07:39.480 align:middle line:84%
According to Storm, a device
similar to the flux capacitor,

00:07:39.480 --> 00:07:41.550 align:middle line:84%
seen in the "Back to
the Future" movies

00:07:41.550 --> 00:07:45.280 align:middle line:90%
was used during the experiment.

00:07:45.280 --> 00:07:47.340 align:middle line:84%
This led to
immediate speculation

00:07:47.340 --> 00:07:50.890 align:middle line:84%
that the US Army was also
working on time travel.

00:07:50.890 --> 00:07:54.300 align:middle line:84%
But it is believed that in
order for time travel to work,

00:07:54.300 --> 00:08:00.270 align:middle line:84%
they would have to generate 1.21
gigawatts, not a trivial feat.

00:08:00.270 --> 00:08:03.150 align:middle line:84%
Storm is quoted as saying,
"We are only concerned

This development could change
the course of human history,"

00:08:08.660 --> 00:08:11.700 align:middle line:84%
Storm said with a
gleam in his eye.

00:08:11.700 --> 00:08:14.520 align:middle line:84%
This story, like Andrew
Basiago's claims,

00:08:14.520 --> 00:08:16.770 align:middle line:90%
could be science fiction.

00:08:16.770 --> 00:08:19.670 align:middle line:84%
However, the stories
could also be true.

00:08:19.670 --> 00:08:24.420 align:middle line:84%
Today, it isn't possible to
confirm them as authentic.

00:08:24.420 --> 00:08:26.970 align:middle line:84%
Only time will tell
if teleportation is

00:08:26.970 --> 00:08:28.665 align:middle line:90%
possible in the 21st century.

00:08:28.665 --> 00:08:32.830 align:middle line:90%


00:08:32.830 --> 00:08:35.080 align:middle line:84%
>> What are we doing trying
to fund teleportation when

00:08:35.080 --> 00:08:36.530 align:middle line:90%
it's existed for 40 years?

00:08:36.530 --> 00:08:38.140 align:middle line:90%
I'm not lying.

00:08:38.140 --> 00:08:40.809 align:middle line:84%
I can give you the
names of the locations

00:08:40.809 --> 00:08:45.230 align:middle line:84%
we were taken to, where time
travel activities occurred.

00:08:45.230 --> 00:08:48.340 align:middle line:84%
I can give you the name
and describe the structure

00:08:48.340 --> 00:08:49.990 align:middle line:90%
and function of the devices.

00:08:49.990 --> 00:08:52.930 align:middle line:84%
I'm giving the name not only of
project insiders, whose names

00:08:52.930 --> 00:08:55.540 align:middle line:84%
will show up in government
records as a result of entering

00:08:55.540 --> 00:08:58.695 align:middle line:84%
certain facilities or having
security badges and so forth.

00:08:58.695 --> 00:09:00.820 align:middle line:84%
I can give you the names
of their friends in places

00:09:00.820 --> 00:09:02.445 align:middle line:84%
like New Mexico and
New Jersey who were

00:09:02.445 --> 00:09:03.640 align:middle line:90%
aware of what was going on.

00:09:03.640 --> 00:09:07.300 align:middle line:90%


00:09:07.300 --> 00:09:11.620 align:middle line:84%
>> The question we ask is, why
were children used for this

00:09:11.620 --> 00:09:12.610 align:middle line:90%
experiment?

00:09:12.610 --> 00:09:15.295 align:middle line:84%
We asked Andrew
Basiago that question.

00:09:15.295 --> 00:09:18.950 align:middle line:90%


00:09:18.950 --> 00:09:23.240 align:middle line:84%
>> Nikola Tesla found a way to
create an apparatus that draws

00:09:23.240 --> 00:09:25.970 align:middle line:84%
radiant energy from the
time-space continuum.

00:09:25.970 --> 00:09:29.900 align:middle line:84%
Radiant energy is a form of
energy that he discovered.

00:09:29.900 --> 00:09:33.930 align:middle line:84%
It is a latent and
pervasive in the universe.

00:09:33.930 --> 00:09:38.160 align:middle line:84%
>> According to Andrew Basiago,
who practices law in Portland,

00:09:38.160 --> 00:09:41.810 align:middle line:84%
Oregon, his father was a
scientist who worked with

00:09:41.810 --> 00:09:46.760 align:middle line:84%
the CIA and was involved in
teleportation experiments

00:09:46.760 --> 00:09:49.100 align:middle line:90%
in the early 1960s.

00:09:49.100 --> 00:09:53.240 align:middle line:84%
>> My father and I first jumped
through a Tesla teleporter

00:09:53.240 --> 00:09:55.970 align:middle line:84%
in Building 68 at the old Curtis
Wright Aeronautical Company

00:09:55.970 --> 00:09:59.000 align:middle line:84%
facility in
Woodbridge, New Jersey,

00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:04.340 align:middle line:84%
sometime between September of
1967 and September of 1968.

00:10:04.340 --> 00:10:07.670 align:middle line:84%
We know that because we arrived
in the state capital complex

00:10:07.670 --> 00:10:08.560 align:middle line:90%
in Santa Fe.

00:10:08.560 --> 00:10:11.450 align:middle line:84%
The teleport would
open up a tunnel

00:10:11.450 --> 00:10:13.540 align:middle line:90%
in the time-space continuum.

00:10:13.540 --> 00:10:16.408 align:middle line:84%
You would find yourself
moving through it.

00:10:16.408 --> 00:10:18.950 align:middle line:84%
And when the tunnel closed, you
would find yourself elsewhere

00:10:18.950 --> 00:10:21.320 align:middle line:90%
on the surface of the planet.

00:10:21.320 --> 00:10:25.400 align:middle line:84%
>> Andrew Basiago only traveled
in the Tesla transporter when

00:10:25.400 --> 00:10:26.750 align:middle line:90%
he was a child.

00:10:26.750 --> 00:10:29.130 align:middle line:90%
Years later, he did it again.

00:10:29.130 --> 00:10:33.260 align:middle line:10%
But on that occasion, the CIA
career officer Courtney Hunt,

00:10:33.260 --> 00:10:36.680 align:middle line:10%
cousin of Howard Hunt, one
of the Watergate figures,

00:10:36.680 --> 00:10:40.940 align:middle line:10%
would convince Andrew Basiago to
participate in a teleportation

00:10:40.940 --> 00:10:42.830 align:middle line:10%
program to the planet Mars.

00:10:42.830 --> 00:10:45.530 align:middle line:90%


00:10:45.530 --> 00:10:50.360 align:middle line:84%
>> So in July 1981, I met
him at the corner of Mason

00:10:50.360 --> 00:10:53.270 align:middle line:84%
and Devonshire in
Chatsworth, California.

00:10:53.270 --> 00:10:56.930 align:middle line:84%
In his car, we drove
to the office building

00:10:56.930 --> 00:11:02.720 align:middle line:84%
that is at the corner of
North Sepulveda Boulevard

00:11:02.720 --> 00:11:05.030 align:middle line:84%
and Imperial
Boulevard, immediately

00:11:05.030 --> 00:11:07.760 align:middle line:84%
southeast of the grounds of
the Los Angeles International

00:11:07.760 --> 00:11:08.690 align:middle line:90%

00:12:19.190 --> 00:12:21.410 align:middle line:84%
>> And Courtney Hunt was
speaking to me through

00:12:21.410 --> 00:12:24.650 align:middle line:84%
the telecom and saying,
are you ready and so forth.

00:12:24.650 --> 00:12:27.150 align:middle line:84%
And I finally grew impatient
because I wanted to go to Mars.

00:12:27.150 --> 00:12:28.970 align:middle line:90%
I don't like waiting for things.

00:12:28.970 --> 00:12:31.640 align:middle line:84%
And so I borrowed
a line, I believe

00:12:31.640 --> 00:12:34.490 align:middle line:84%
that was from Alan Shepard
during the space program, which

00:12:34.490 --> 00:12:35.660 align:middle line:90%
was, "light this candle."

00:12:35.660 --> 00:12:37.040 align:middle line:90%
Maybe it was John Glenn.

00:12:37.040 --> 00:12:41.533 align:middle line:84%
But I cribbed some wording from
one of the American astronauts.

00:12:41.533 --> 00:12:43.700 align:middle line:84%
And I said, rather impatiently,
"light this candle."

00:12:43.700 --> 00:12:45.763 align:middle line:84%
I was really
growing exasperated.

00:12:45.763 --> 00:12:47.430 align:middle line:84%
I couldn't tell that
much was happening.

00:12:47.430 --> 00:12:49.013 align:middle line:84%
All that was happening
was that panels

00:12:49.013 --> 00:12:51.350 align:middle line:84%
of light on the top and
bottom of the elevator

00:12:51.350 --> 00:12:53.330 align:middle line:90%
started blinking.

00:12:53.330 --> 00:12:57.510 align:middle line:84%
And then about 10 minutes into
the 20-minute journey to Mars,

00:12:57.510 --> 00:13:01.340 align:middle line:84%
the entire form of
this box-like elevator

00:13:01.340 --> 00:13:05.840 align:middle line:84%
began to morph and crumple
and reposition itself

00:13:05.840 --> 00:13:07.100 align:middle line:90%
into a cylinder.

00:13:07.100 --> 00:13:10.522 align:middle line:84%
And when that happened, I had
to steady myself in the elevator

00:13:10.522 --> 00:13:12.980 align:middle line:84%
such as you would if you were
walking through a water main.

00:13:12.980 --> 00:13:14.655 align:middle line:84%
You're walking in a
cylindrical object,

00:13:14.655 --> 00:13:16.280 align:middle line:84%
so you have to kind
of steady yourself.

00:13:16.280 --> 00:13:18.860 align:middle line:84%
And I saw that the
ceiling had become

00:13:18.860 --> 00:13:20.190 align:middle line:90%
the surface I was looking at.

00:13:20.190 --> 00:13:22.107 align:middle line:84%
And I could see this
sort of swirling pattern.

00:13:22.107 --> 00:13:24.770 align:middle line:84%
They'd opened up a vortal tunnel
in the fabric of time-space,

00:13:24.770 --> 00:13:26.960 align:middle line:84%
just as the teleporter
did back when I

00:13:26.960 --> 00:13:29.520 align:middle line:90%
was a child on Project Pegasus.

00:13:29.520 --> 00:13:32.610 align:middle line:84%
And that lasted for maybe
two to four minutes or so,

00:13:32.610 --> 00:13:34.370 align:middle line:90%
and then it became a cylinder.

00:13:34.370 --> 00:13:35.990 align:middle line:84%
And then it began
correcting itself,

00:13:35.990 --> 00:13:41.002 align:middle line:84%
and then it just completely
rectified its original shape.

00:13:41.002 --> 00:13:43.460 align:middle line:84%
And then about 10 minutes later,
as Courtney had described,

00:13:43.460 --> 00:13:45.800 align:middle line:84%
the door opened,
and I walked out

00:13:45.800 --> 00:13:47.960 align:middle line:84%
into what looked like,
if you can imagine

00:13:47.960 --> 00:13:51.940 align:middle line:84%
the basement of a modern sports
arena, the infrastructure

00:13:51.940 --> 00:13:54.860 align:middle line:84%
of that built into an
existing underground cavern

00:13:54.860 --> 00:13:56.570 align:middle line:90%
of an ancient civilization.

00:13:56.570 --> 00:14:00.020 align:middle line:84%
There was a big cave in which I
could see these modern tension

00:14:00.020 --> 00:14:02.690 align:middle line:84%
struts, a sort of infrastructure
that had been placed inside,

00:14:02.690 --> 00:14:04.357 align:middle line:84%
and the jump room
itself had been placed

00:14:04.357 --> 00:14:05.630 align:middle line:90%
inside this ancient cavern.

00:14:05.630 --> 00:14:07.005 align:middle line:84%
I walked through
what was clearly

00:14:07.005 --> 00:14:09.260 align:middle line:84%
the irregular eye sockets
of some kind of skull

00:14:09.260 --> 00:14:10.470 align:middle line:90%
on the surface.

00:14:10.470 --> 00:14:11.270 align:middle line:90%
I turned around.

00:14:11.270 --> 00:14:12.770 align:middle line:90%
I could see it was a skull.

00:14:12.770 --> 00:14:15.980 align:middle line:84%
I could see the rust-red
terrain of Mars.

00:14:15.980 --> 00:14:19.250 align:middle line:84%
I could see that Mars
has a pale blue sky.

00:14:19.250 --> 00:14:23.730 align:middle line:84%
I could see, or sense, rather,
that Mars smelt of gunpowder,

00:14:23.730 --> 00:14:26.960 align:middle line:84%
which must have been some
sulfur content, at least

00:14:26.960 --> 00:14:28.030 align:middle line:90%
at that location.

temperature on Mars?

00:14:30.140 --> 00:14:31.630 align:middle line:90%
What do they keep on Mars?

00:14:31.630 --> 00:14:33.210 align:middle line:90%
>> It was about 70 degrees.

00:14:33.210 --> 00:14:36.260 align:middle line:84%
Now, the conventional
scientific literature about Mars

00:14:36.260 --> 00:14:39.680 align:middle line:84%
states either that Mars
is prohibitively cold

00:14:39.680 --> 00:14:41.630 align:middle line:84%
or that Mars has
temperate regions that

00:14:41.630 --> 00:14:44.000 align:middle line:90%
would be survivable by humans.

00:14:44.000 --> 00:14:45.960 align:middle line:84%
And I turned, and I
saw a small human being

00:14:45.960 --> 00:14:48.390 align:middle line:84%
from our civilization
on Earth run up to me.

00:14:48.390 --> 00:14:51.585 align:middle line:84%
And then two more individuals
a couple years older than me--

00:14:51.585 --> 00:14:55.350 align:middle line:84%
and I would say they were
maybe 21, 22, 23 years of age--

00:14:55.350 --> 00:14:58.192 align:middle line:84%
ran up to me, two
men and a woman.

00:14:58.192 --> 00:15:00.150 align:middle line:84%
And I was interacting
with the first individual

00:15:00.150 --> 00:15:01.683 align:middle line:90%
who ran up to my location.

00:15:01.683 --> 00:15:03.600 align:middle line:84%
And they were clearly
human beings from Earth.

00:15:03.600 --> 00:15:04.920 align:middle line:90%
They weren't Martians.

00:15:04.920 --> 00:15:06.480 align:middle line:90%
They looked normal.

00:15:06.480 --> 00:15:08.131 align:middle line:90%
They were speaking English.

What we can say is
that this is a detail.

00:15:20.270 --> 00:15:23.930 align:middle line:10%
It's an enlargement of a segment
of one of the glass tubes

00:15:23.930 --> 00:15:26.750 align:middle line:10%
that have been found in
various places on Mars.

goes against their free will.

the world the truth.

00:17:45.970 --> 00:17:48.750 align:middle line:84%

to tell the whole world
because what we were

And I recognize that
that was a privilege.

And certainly telling the
story of those technical

achievements,
because of the value

00:19:33.600 --> 00:19:35.760 align:middle line:84%
that they could bring to
our global civilization,

00:19:35.760 --> 00:19:37.802 align:middle line:84%
is more important than
worrying about whether I'm

00:19:37.802 --> 00:19:41.010 align:middle line:84%
going to be killed or not as
a result of coming forward.

be a truth teller,

say anything for sure--

00:19:50.410 --> 00:19:51.210 align:middle line:90%
anything.

00:19:51.210 --> 00:19:53.580 align:middle line:84%
But the fact that when I
came out with my story,

00:19:53.580 --> 00:19:55.830 align:middle line:84%
I discovered that all these
other people had something

00:19:55.830 --> 00:19:58.380 align:middle line:84%
to say about it, people that
are very credible, people that

00:19:58.380 --> 00:20:02.310 align:middle line:84%
have had their lives
taken away from them.

00:20:02.310 --> 00:20:06.900 align:middle line:84%
Even somebody like Andy,
who had this happen starting

as a child who lived
to tell the tale

00:20:09.570 --> 00:20:14.180 align:middle line:84%

to what I discovered.

since the inception

such a sensitive topic.

I'm willing to take.

I'm pursuing a cause that
I'm not willing to postpone,

00:20:32.550 --> 00:20:34.650 align:middle line:84%
and I believe that
I will prevail it.

00:20:34.650 --> 00:20:39.330 align:middle line:84%

this revolutionary form
