In 1976, a team of scientist led
by NASA engineer Gilbert Levin

00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:21.030 align:middle line:84%
claimed to have found
life on the Red Planet.

00:00:21.030 --> 00:00:24.170 align:middle line:84%
However, the directors
of the Viking mission

00:00:24.170 --> 00:00:28.190 align:middle line:84%
did not reach a consensus
on whether his results were

00:00:28.190 --> 00:00:29.780 align:middle line:90%
proof of life.

00:00:29.780 --> 00:00:34.280 align:middle line:84%

no future searches for life

the European Space Agency
has sought to confirm that

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:56.690 align:middle line:84%
the presence of methane on
Mars is a result of bacteria

00:01:56.690 --> 00:01:59.450 align:middle line:90%
activity producing this gas.

are a key piece of the ExoMars

00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:11.150 align:middle line:90%
to study methane--

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:13.970 align:middle line:90%
a gas that the Earth produces.

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:17.390 align:middle line:84%
Living organisms naturally
produce this gas.

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:23.490 align:middle line:84%
And the discovery on Mars was
a complete surprise in 2004.

00:02:23.490 --> 00:02:27.150 align:middle line:84%
The European Space Agency's
Mars Express Orbiter

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:30.150 align:middle line:84%
found large amounts of
methane at that time

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:31.920 align:middle line:90%
on the surface of Mars.

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:34.650 align:middle line:90%
And then oddly, it disappeared.

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:38.370 align:middle line:84%
Methane, a natural gas,
takes centuries to degrade.

00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:40.470 align:middle line:84%
Therefore, the
surprising variability

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:43.170 align:middle line:84%
of methane abundance
led some scientists

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:47.220 align:middle line:84%
to suggest its organic
origin and its presence

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:52.440 align:middle line:84%
was cyclical, meaning it is
related to seasonal spikes.

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:55.470 align:middle line:84%
Since then, European scientists
have carried out missions

00:02:55.470 --> 00:02:58.830 align:middle line:84%
to search for bacteria
that produce methane.

00:02:58.830 --> 00:03:01.080 align:middle line:84%
But they have been
faced with a planet that

00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:02.640 align:middle line:90%
is very unpredictable.

00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:07.540 align:middle line:90%


00:03:07.540 --> 00:03:12.010 align:middle line:84%
Both the Beagle mission in 2003
and the Schiaparelli mission

00:03:12.010 --> 00:03:15.550 align:middle line:84%
in 2016 succumbed
to a planet that

00:03:15.550 --> 00:03:18.520 align:middle line:84%
has become the graveyard
of countless missions

00:03:18.520 --> 00:03:21.710 align:middle line:90%
over the past 50 years.

00:03:21.710 --> 00:03:24.310 align:middle line:84%
However, the Trace
Gas Orbiter mission

00:03:24.310 --> 00:03:27.860 align:middle line:84%
could generate extraordinary
results in the coming months.

00:03:27.860 --> 00:03:30.370 align:middle line:84%
But only if it was
confirmed that methane

00:03:30.370 --> 00:03:34.510 align:middle line:84%
appears and disappears with
a predictable regularity.

00:03:34.510 --> 00:03:38.080 align:middle line:84%
The Schiaparelli mission could
have confirmed these results

00:03:38.080 --> 00:03:41.920 align:middle line:84%
with an analysis on the
ground, but unfortunately, it

00:03:41.920 --> 00:03:44.510 align:middle line:90%
did not happen.

00:03:44.510 --> 00:03:48.370 align:middle line:84%
NOMAD will not only generate
the first accurate global map

00:03:48.370 --> 00:03:52.870 align:middle line:84%
of methane in the atmosphere of
Mars, but will also track it.

Observing it against the
surface of the Red Planet

00:03:55.690 --> 00:03:57.790 align:middle line:84%
to find the source
of production,

00:03:57.790 --> 00:04:00.580 align:middle line:84%
and the disappearance of
the gas when it happens.

00:04:00.580 --> 00:04:03.850 align:middle line:84%
NOMAD will also be able to
distinguish the methane's

00:04:03.850 --> 00:04:07.300 align:middle line:84%
isotopic composition
to find its geological

00:04:07.300 --> 00:04:08.860 align:middle line:90%
or biological origin.

00:04:08.860 --> 00:04:14.110 align:middle line:90%

Meanwhile, the
2020 rover mission

00:04:16.899 --> 00:04:20.350 align:middle line:84%
is preparing to collect
samples of the Martian soil,

00:04:20.350 --> 00:04:25.130 align:middle line:84%
and send them back to
Earth, not an easy task.

00:04:25.130 --> 00:04:29.980 align:middle line:84%
The general mission is known
as MSR, the Mars Sample Return

00:04:29.980 --> 00:04:34.180 align:middle line:84%
mission, and will consist of at
least three separate missions.

00:04:34.180 --> 00:04:38.530 align:middle line:84%
In the first mission, the 2020
Mars, a twin of Curiosity,

00:04:38.530 --> 00:04:41.530 align:middle line:84%
will take a drill and
collect soil samples

00:04:41.530 --> 00:04:43.810 align:middle line:84%
throughout its land
exploration process.

00:04:43.810 --> 00:04:46.470 align:middle line:90%


00:04:46.470 --> 00:04:51.170 align:middle line:84%
The second stage will be the
SRL probe, a sample retrieval

00:04:51.170 --> 00:04:54.170 align:middle line:84%
and launch mission to
collect the samples obtained

00:04:54.170 --> 00:04:58.550 align:middle line:84%
by the 2020 Rover, and
launch them into Mars orbit

00:04:58.550 --> 00:05:02.890 align:middle line:84%
to be collected
by the SRO probes.

00:05:02.890 --> 00:05:06.100 align:middle line:84%
The probe will be launched
into space by a MAV--

00:05:06.100 --> 00:05:08.180 align:middle line:90%
a Mars ascent vehicle.

00:05:08.180 --> 00:05:10.930 align:middle line:84%
This is a rover based
on the Curiosity design

00:05:10.930 --> 00:05:15.740 align:middle line:84%
that would transport the
MAV rocket on its back.

00:05:15.740 --> 00:05:18.010 align:middle line:84%
This mobile MAV would
be able to travel over

00:05:18.010 --> 00:05:21.010 align:middle line:84%
a considerable distance,
and could launch the MAV

00:05:21.010 --> 00:05:23.170 align:middle line:84%
from almost any
point in its journey.

00:05:23.170 --> 00:05:26.850 align:middle line:90%


00:05:26.850 --> 00:05:30.540 align:middle line:84%
The orbiter that will transport
the samples back to Earth

00:05:30.540 --> 00:05:33.270 align:middle line:90%
will be launched in 2024.

00:05:33.270 --> 00:05:36.360 align:middle line:84%
And it is thought that before
the end of the next decade,

00:05:36.360 --> 00:05:40.320 align:middle line:84%
it will be possible to confirm
or reject the possibility

00:05:40.320 --> 00:05:43.535 align:middle line:84%
that microscopic life
on Mars now exists.

00:05:43.535 --> 00:05:49.110 align:middle line:90%


00:05:49.110 --> 00:05:53.220 align:middle line:84%
According to the plans, NASA
has three possible scenarios

00:05:53.220 --> 00:05:55.800 align:middle line:90%
to search for life on Mars.

00:05:55.800 --> 00:05:59.190 align:middle line:84%
The Jezero crater, a
favorite among researchers,

00:05:59.190 --> 00:06:01.320 align:middle line:84%
is an ancient lake
with sediments

00:06:01.320 --> 00:06:04.350 align:middle line:90%
of all types and fossil deltas.

00:06:04.350 --> 00:06:07.170 align:middle line:84%
The presence of carbonates
and phyllosilicates

00:06:07.170 --> 00:06:09.960 align:middle line:84%
indicate that the water
of the lake at one time

00:06:09.960 --> 00:06:15.160 align:middle line:84%
had a neutral pH, meaning that
it was habitable for life.

00:06:15.160 --> 00:06:18.930 align:middle line:84%
Unlike other younger areas on
Mars, such as the Meridiani

00:06:18.930 --> 00:06:21.510 align:middle line:84%
Planum, the second
place, selected

00:06:21.510 --> 00:06:25.890 align:middle line:84%
is the region of Syrtis Major,
one of the oldest on Mars.

00:06:25.890 --> 00:06:27.900 align:middle line:84%
And is covered by
clay minerals that

00:06:27.900 --> 00:06:33.300 align:middle line:84%
revealed the ancient presence
of water at high temperatures.

area of Columbia Hills,

00:06:36.300 --> 00:06:39.150 align:middle line:84%
the Gusev crater is
already well-known

00:06:39.150 --> 00:06:43.440 align:middle line:84%
as it was explored by the famous
Spirit rover a decade ago.

00:06:43.440 --> 00:06:45.960 align:middle line:84%

2020 exploration

00:06:48.930 --> 00:06:51.450 align:middle line:90%
has caused much controversy.

00:06:51.450 --> 00:06:54.600 align:middle line:84%
The discovery of the
presence of silica by Spirit

00:06:54.600 --> 00:06:56.640 align:middle line:84%
is evidence that
in the past, there

00:06:56.640 --> 00:07:01.260 align:middle line:84%
were hydrothermal vents
in the surface of Mars.

00:07:01.260 --> 00:07:05.910 align:middle line:84%
Syrtis Major, or Jezero, are
areas in which liquid water

00:07:05.910 --> 00:07:08.760 align:middle line:90%
ran across the Martian surface.

00:07:08.760 --> 00:07:12.540 align:middle line:84%
In Columbia Hills, the water
came out of its interior.

00:07:12.540 --> 00:07:15.300 align:middle line:84%
If this place is chosen,
it would be the first time

00:07:15.300 --> 00:07:18.300 align:middle line:84%
that a Martian probe has
landed in the same place

00:07:18.300 --> 00:07:20.310 align:middle line:90%
as a previous mission.

00:07:20.310 --> 00:07:23.490 align:middle line:84%
However, of the three
places, Columbia Hills

00:07:23.490 --> 00:07:25.290 align:middle line:90%
was the least preferred.

00:07:25.290 --> 00:07:28.290 align:middle line:84%

be in the final selection.

their destination respectively

00:08:28.640 --> 00:08:33.470 align:middle line:10%
in July and September
of 1976, were expressly

00:08:33.470 --> 00:08:37.280 align:middle line:10%
equipped for a series of
specific organic tests.

00:08:37.280 --> 00:08:40.940 align:middle line:84%

The soil study,
on the other hand,

00:08:49.470 --> 00:08:53.300 align:middle line:84%
was carried out through
four biochemical tests.

an experiment that went to Mars

00:09:46.760 --> 00:09:52.640 align:middle line:84%
to look for life, by picking up
a sample of the Martian soil--

00:09:52.640 --> 00:09:56.720 align:middle line:84%
the Viking spacecraft
Lander did that.

00:09:56.720 --> 00:10:01.850 align:middle line:84%
And inoculating it
into a small tube,

00:10:01.850 --> 00:10:07.850 align:middle line:84%
in which a squirt of
radioactive nutrient was placed.

00:10:07.850 --> 00:10:10.640 align:middle line:84%
Were any microorganisms
present--

00:10:10.640 --> 00:10:14.450 align:middle line:84%
hopefully-- they would
recognize the nutrient,

00:10:14.450 --> 00:10:18.050 align:middle line:84%
eat it, and give
off radioactive gas.

00:10:18.050 --> 00:10:22.880 align:middle line:84%
Well, no one, including
me, was very hopeful this

00:10:22.880 --> 00:10:25.130 align:middle line:90%
would work on Mars.

00:10:25.130 --> 00:10:28.940 align:middle line:84%
However, the possibility
of life on Mars

00:10:28.940 --> 00:10:33.800 align:middle line:84%
was so astounding that NASA
described the whole experiment

00:10:33.800 --> 00:10:37.460 align:middle line:84%
of looking for life on Mars
as perhaps, the greatest

00:10:37.460 --> 00:10:40.460 align:middle line:84%
experiment in the
history of science.

00:10:40.460 --> 00:10:41.900 align:middle line:90%
Which is puzzling.

00:10:41.900 --> 00:10:44.250 align:middle line:84%
Because while they
still say that,

00:10:44.250 --> 00:10:49.280 align:middle line:84%
there's something wrong in
their lack of pursuit of it.

00:10:49.280 --> 00:10:52.400 align:middle line:84%
At any rate,
surprisingly, as soon

00:10:52.400 --> 00:10:56.420 align:middle line:84%
as the first square squirt of
nutrient hit that Martian soil,

00:10:56.420 --> 00:11:00.080 align:middle line:84%
we got a big bulge
of gas coming out.

00:11:00.080 --> 00:11:06.590 align:middle line:84%
And it came out for the entire
seven days, or Martian sols,

00:11:06.590 --> 00:11:09.200 align:middle line:90%
of the experiment.

00:11:09.200 --> 00:11:11.000 align:middle line:90%
That was astounding.

00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:15.740 align:middle line:10%
But we had conceived
of that possibility

00:11:15.740 --> 00:11:20.270 align:middle line:10%
being false, being
absolutely conducted

00:11:20.270 --> 00:11:24.030 align:middle line:10%
by chemicals in the soil,
rather than microorganisms.

00:11:24.030 --> 00:11:26.450 align:middle line:90%
So we had a test for that, too.

00:11:26.450 --> 00:11:30.140 align:middle line:84%
We had a control experiment
carefully designed,

00:11:30.140 --> 00:11:32.390 align:middle line:90%
really designed by NASA.

00:11:32.390 --> 00:11:38.070 align:middle line:84%
And it was if you ever unlikely
got a positive response,

00:11:38.070 --> 00:11:42.260 align:middle line:84%
you would take a duplicate
sample of that same soil.

00:11:42.260 --> 00:11:47.720 align:middle line:84%
And put it in a little tube,
just like the first sample.

00:11:47.720 --> 00:11:52.430 align:middle line:84%
But now heated to 160 degrees
centigrade-- a temperature

00:11:52.430 --> 00:11:57.560 align:middle line:84%
they selected as killing any
microorganisms known on Earth,

00:11:57.560 --> 00:12:02.840 align:middle line:84%
but not high enough to
destroy oxidizing chemicals

00:12:02.840 --> 00:12:05.330 align:middle line:84%
that might have
given a false answer.

00:12:05.330 --> 00:12:07.550 align:middle line:90%
So this is called the control.

00:12:07.550 --> 00:12:09.530 align:middle line:90%
You run the control.

00:12:09.530 --> 00:12:15.110 align:middle line:84%
And if it's positive, then
the agent that was active,

00:12:15.110 --> 00:12:18.440 align:middle line:84%
survived the heating-- so it's
not microbial, it's chemical.

00:12:18.440 --> 00:12:20.900 align:middle line:84%
But if it's negative,
you've killed

00:12:20.900 --> 00:12:23.190 align:middle line:90%
something that had been alive.

00:12:23.190 --> 00:12:26.390 align:middle line:84%
And that's the confirmation
that it was indeed,

00:12:26.390 --> 00:12:29.810 align:middle line:84%
a positive response for
living microorganisms

00:12:29.810 --> 00:12:32.150 align:middle line:90%
in the soil of Mars.

00:12:32.150 --> 00:12:33.880 align:middle line:90%
That is what happened.

00:12:45.480 --> 00:12:48.680 align:middle line:84%

one of the experiments

showed that the soil

test positive for a
metabolism or microorganism.

excavation near the north pole

00:18:38.970 --> 00:18:40.350 align:middle line:10%
of Mars.

00:18:40.350 --> 00:18:43.020 align:middle line:84%
Earlier, some pieces
of ice were classified

00:18:43.020 --> 00:18:46.860 align:middle line:84%
after being unearthed on
June 15 by the mechanical arm

00:18:46.860 --> 00:18:48.330 align:middle line:90%
of the robot.

00:18:48.330 --> 00:18:52.080 align:middle line:84%
Later, it was determined that
the Martian soil is alkaline,

00:18:52.080 --> 00:18:55.050 align:middle line:84%
with a pH of between
eight and nine.

00:18:55.050 --> 00:18:58.050 align:middle line:84%
And was analogous to the
soil of the nearby surface

00:18:58.050 --> 00:19:01.680 align:middle line:84%
in the valleys of
Antarctica on Earth.

00:19:01.680 --> 00:19:04.530 align:middle line:84%
On September 30,
2008, the Phoenix

00:19:04.530 --> 00:19:07.540 align:middle line:84%
detected snow in the
atmosphere of Mars,

00:19:07.540 --> 00:19:10.590 align:middle line:84%
which was an
unprecedented observation.

00:19:10.590 --> 00:19:12.840 align:middle line:84%
A laser instrument
designed to analyze

00:19:12.840 --> 00:19:15.180 align:middle line:84%
interactions between
the atmosphere

00:19:15.180 --> 00:19:17.280 align:middle line:84%
and the surface of
the Martian soil

00:19:17.280 --> 00:19:23.040 align:middle line:84%
detected snow from clouds at
4,000 meters above Phoenix.

00:19:23.040 --> 00:19:25.350 align:middle line:84%
According to the
observations, the snowflakes

00:19:25.350 --> 00:19:29.610 align:middle line:84%
turned into gas before
reaching the surface of Mars.

00:19:29.610 --> 00:19:32.310 align:middle line:84%
Experiments conducted
with Phoenix instruments

00:19:32.310 --> 00:19:36.270 align:middle line:84%
also revealed traces of chemical
reactions between minerals

00:19:36.270 --> 00:19:39.840 align:middle line:84%
from the Martian soil
and liquid water,

00:19:39.840 --> 00:19:43.080 align:middle line:84%
indicating periods in
Mars historical past

00:19:43.080 --> 00:19:46.410 align:middle line:90%
that water ran on the surface.

00:19:46.410 --> 00:19:48.750 align:middle line:84%
The data generated
by the Phoenix probes

00:19:48.750 --> 00:19:51.150 align:middle line:84%
also suggests the
presence of calcium

00:19:51.150 --> 00:19:55.290 align:middle line:84%
carbonate, the main
component of limestone.

00:19:55.290 --> 00:19:57.780 align:middle line:84%
Most carbonates
and clays on Earth

00:19:57.780 --> 00:20:00.990 align:middle line:84%
are formed in the
presence of water.

00:20:00.990 --> 00:20:03.720 align:middle line:84%
The analysis of
some images and data

00:20:03.720 --> 00:20:07.380 align:middle line:84%
show what appeared to be drops
of liquid saline water that

00:20:07.380 --> 00:20:10.830 align:middle line:84%
splashed the legs of
the probe after landing.

00:20:10.830 --> 00:20:14.790 align:middle line:84%
The climate on Mars is more
extreme than that on Earth.

00:20:14.790 --> 00:20:17.190 align:middle line:10%
And given that it is
farther from the sun,

00:20:17.190 --> 00:20:20.430 align:middle line:10%
the cold is more intense,
with an average temperature

00:20:20.430 --> 00:20:23.730 align:middle line:10%
of minus 63 degrees Celsius.

00:20:23.730 --> 00:20:28.170 align:middle line:10%
Although it can descend to 80
degrees below zero Celsius.

00:20:28.170 --> 00:20:29.910 align:middle line:84%
However, during the
day, the temperature

00:20:29.910 --> 00:20:33.040 align:middle line:90%
can reach 20 degrees Celsius.

00:20:33.040 --> 00:20:36.030 align:middle line:10%
The temperature at the Mars
two poles during the winter

00:20:36.030 --> 00:20:39.990 align:middle line:10%
can drop to 140
degrees below zero.

00:20:39.990 --> 00:20:43.440 align:middle line:84%
And in the summer, it can
exceed 30 degrees centigrade

00:20:43.440 --> 00:20:46.600 align:middle line:90%
or 86 degrees Fahrenheit.

00:20:46.600 --> 00:20:50.210 align:middle line:10%
It is possible that Mars
could be a habitable planet.

00:20:50.210 --> 00:20:52.560 align:middle line:10%
Its temperatures are
lower than on Earth,

00:20:52.560 --> 00:20:55.830 align:middle line:10%
but not enough to consider that
life could not exist there.

00:20:55.830 --> 00:20:59.500 align:middle line:90%


00:20:59.500 --> 00:21:03.040 align:middle line:84%
The device that you see
here is called MOXIE.

00:21:03.040 --> 00:21:06.520 align:middle line:84%
MOXIE is being designed to
use the electricity generated

00:21:06.520 --> 00:21:11.470 align:middle line:84%
by a separate machine to convert
carbon monoxide to oxygen.

00:21:11.470 --> 00:21:15.490 align:middle line:84%
Mars' atmosphere has the
presence of 96% oxygen

00:21:15.490 --> 00:21:17.620 align:middle line:90%
and carbon monoxide.

00:21:17.620 --> 00:21:22.210 align:middle line:84%
The goal is to build a 100 scale
MOXIE so then in the 2030s,

00:21:22.210 --> 00:21:25.060 align:middle line:84%
it could produce liquid
oxygen for tanks.

00:21:25.060 --> 00:21:27.130 align:middle line:84%
The purpose of these
liquid oxygen tanks

00:21:27.130 --> 00:21:29.800 align:middle line:84%
would be to store fuel
so that astronauts could

00:21:29.800 --> 00:21:33.790 align:middle line:84%
breathe oxygen. And be able
to return to Earth from Mars.

00:21:33.790 --> 00:21:36.130 align:middle line:84%
It has been determined
that MOXIE could operate

00:21:36.130 --> 00:21:40.420 align:middle line:84%
for a period of 50 Martian days,
equivalent to about 51 Earth

00:21:40.420 --> 00:21:44.530 align:middle line:84%
days, producing about 20
grams of oxygen per hour.

00:21:44.530 --> 00:21:46.660 align:middle line:84%
With the extended
version of the device,

00:21:46.660 --> 00:21:50.980 align:middle line:84%
it is expected to produce about
2 kilograms of oxygen per hour.

00:21:50.980 --> 00:21:53.530 align:middle line:84%
The MOXIE device would
be a necessary piece

00:21:53.530 --> 00:21:55.090 align:middle line:90%
of Mars equipment.

00:21:55.090 --> 00:21:59.900 align:middle line:90%


00:21:59.900 --> 00:22:03.440 align:middle line:84%
>> This means that there
are great possibilities

00:22:03.440 --> 00:22:07.040 align:middle line:84%
for the existence of
human life on Mars.

00:22:07.040 --> 00:22:10.070 align:middle line:84%
In our next episode,
we will analyze

00:22:10.070 --> 00:22:12.590 align:middle line:84%
the life forms that
could be living

00:22:12.590 --> 00:22:14.930 align:middle line:84%
on the Red Planet
at this moment.

00:22:14.930 --> 00:22:18.110 align:middle line:84%
The extremophile
organisms that thrive

00:22:18.110 --> 00:22:21.650 align:middle line:84%
in extreme conditions that
have been found on the Earth

00:22:21.650 --> 00:22:25.520 align:middle line:84%
show that they are very
resistant to practically,

00:22:25.520 --> 00:22:28.340 align:middle line:84%
all of the most difficult
conditions for life.

00:22:28.340 --> 00:22:30.980 align:middle line:84%
I am Jaime Maussan,
and I will see you

00:22:30.980 --> 00:22:33.340 align:middle line:90%
on the next episode of "Nuevo."
