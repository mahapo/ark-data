a videotape for 53 minutes,

00:04:21.920 --> 00:04:25.560 align:middle line:10%
and at the end, at 4:00
o'clock in the afternoon,

my camera suddenly stopped
working and became unusable.

these excellent images, where

00:04:34.310 --> 00:04:36.740 align:middle line:10%

it is the Virgin Mary.

that it was a light that

emanated and vibrated.

kept moving forward to us.

00:16:13.050 --> 00:16:18.450 align:middle line:84%
At that time, Antonio's
camera was not very modern.

00:16:18.450 --> 00:16:21.360 align:middle line:84%
By the way, when he
finished recording,

00:16:21.360 --> 00:16:25.590 align:middle line:84%
the camera broke and
did not work again.

00:16:25.590 --> 00:16:27.360 align:middle line:84%
As I said, the
figure came closer,

00:16:27.360 --> 00:16:30.840 align:middle line:84%
but we did not know
she was the Virgin.

00:16:32.790 --> 00:16:39.510 align:middle line:84%
First, we thought it was maybe
a saint or a mystical object.

00:16:39.510 --> 00:16:42.390 align:middle line:84%
At no time did we think
it was the Virgin.

00:16:42.390 --> 00:16:46.080 align:middle line:84%
But then we saw the
characteristics of her figure,

00:16:46.080 --> 00:16:48.870 align:middle line:90%
and the child in her arms.

As witnesses, we have my

before filming the Virgin,

00:16:56.130 --> 00:16:59.860 align:middle line:84%
I took the video of an
eagle above my house.

00:16:59.860 --> 00:17:02.550 align:middle line:84%
At that time, many
eagles passed by here,

significant to me.

to those of Giorgio Bongiovanni.

00:19:03.650 --> 00:19:06.610 align:middle line:84%
The two unite their
incredible abilities

00:19:06.610 --> 00:19:09.580 align:middle line:84%
in the mystical
and cosmic part--

00:19:09.580 --> 00:19:12.630 align:middle line:84%
the stigmatized
and the contacted.

00:19:12.630 --> 00:19:14.350 align:middle line:84%
There is a very
close relationship

00:19:14.350 --> 00:19:16.570 align:middle line:90%
between the two of them.

00:19:16.570 --> 00:19:19.660 align:middle line:84%
You know that many times
Giorgio notifies Antonio

00:19:19.660 --> 00:19:22.150 align:middle line:84%
that he is going
to record an event,

00:19:22.150 --> 00:19:25.090 align:middle line:84%
and that happens
a few days later.

00:19:25.090 --> 00:19:28.550 align:middle line:84%
In the video of the
Virgin, the two qualities,

00:19:28.550 --> 00:19:33.820 align:middle line:84%
mysticism and extraterrestrial
contact, are combined.

00:19:33.820 --> 00:19:36.520 align:middle line:84%
The video is fascinating
because the figure

00:19:36.520 --> 00:19:43.030 align:middle line:84%
is human, feminine, very
similar to the many painted

00:19:43.030 --> 00:19:49.360 align:middle line:84%
representations of the Virgin
that exists in the world.

00:19:49.360 --> 00:19:52.780 align:middle line:84%
Another point of
interest is that a sphere

00:19:52.780 --> 00:19:57.700 align:middle line:84%
is passes below the Virgin,
and the female figure

00:19:57.700 --> 00:20:00.220 align:middle line:90%
carries a child in her arms.

00:20:00.220 --> 00:20:02.950 align:middle line:90%
She moves, she turns her head.

00:20:02.950 --> 00:20:05.980 align:middle line:84%
I think it is a unique event
in the history of humanity.

00:20:05.980 --> 00:20:09.190 align:middle line:84%
Never seen anything like
it about the Virgin.

00:20:09.190 --> 00:20:12.370 align:middle line:84%
So summarizing, in the case
of Antonio and Giorgio,

00:20:12.370 --> 00:20:15.670 align:middle line:84%
the video combines the two
manifestations-- the cosmic

00:20:15.670 --> 00:20:17.425 align:middle line:90%
and the divine, the mystical.

00:20:17.425 --> 00:20:20.060 align:middle line:90%


00:20:20.060 --> 00:20:23.390 align:middle line:84%
>> A week before the
extraordinary apparition,

00:20:23.390 --> 00:20:27.080 align:middle line:84%
Giorgio told Antonio Urzi that
he would get a vision from

00:20:27.080 --> 00:20:30.800 align:middle line:84%
the Virgin, exactly
as it happened.

00:20:30.800 --> 00:20:33.230 align:middle line:84%
Why has this event,
that in the past

00:20:33.230 --> 00:20:35.270 align:middle line:84%
would have been
considered a miracle,

00:20:35.270 --> 00:20:39.660 align:middle line:84%
not received any attention
from the public or the media?

00:20:39.660 --> 00:20:41.845 align:middle line:90%
Giorgio Bongiovanni responded.

00:20:41.845 --> 00:20:42.720 align:middle line:90%
>> [SPEAKING ITALIAN]

00:20:42.720 --> 00:20:47.730 align:middle line:84%
>> Today, in our
materialistic modern society,

00:20:47.730 --> 00:20:52.980 align:middle line:84%
a large percentage of people now
have easy access to the latest

00:20:52.980 --> 00:20:55.350 align:middle line:90%
technology.

00:20:55.350 --> 00:21:02.100 align:middle line:84%
Video cameras can be purchased
with the best image definition.

00:21:02.100 --> 00:21:07.470 align:middle line:84%
They can do with them what
they like without hesitation.

00:21:07.470 --> 00:21:10.590 align:middle line:90%
It is a double-edged sword--

00:21:10.590 --> 00:21:16.170 align:middle line:84%
one being indifferent, and
the other is materialism--

00:21:16.170 --> 00:21:21.020 align:middle line:84%
which makes us ignorant to
extraordinary realities.

00:21:21.020 --> 00:21:26.160 align:middle line:90%


00:21:26.160 --> 00:21:30.420 align:middle line:84%
For many, the
civilizations of antiquity

00:21:30.420 --> 00:21:34.530 align:middle line:84%
are considered
savage or backward,

00:21:34.530 --> 00:21:37.320 align:middle line:90%
which is not the case.

00:21:37.320 --> 00:21:41.730 align:middle line:84%
I think we have fallen
behind spiritually,

00:21:41.730 --> 00:21:46.500 align:middle line:84%
despite the
technological revolution.

00:21:46.500 --> 00:21:52.380 align:middle line:84%
If Antonio's video had
been filmed 50, or 60,

00:21:52.380 --> 00:21:57.450 align:middle line:84%
or 70 years ago, a global
commotion would have occurred.

00:21:57.450 --> 00:22:02.100 align:middle line:90%


00:22:02.100 --> 00:22:06.870 align:middle line:84%
But not today, because
very few get excited

00:22:06.870 --> 00:22:12.950 align:middle line:84%
about the search for
God and spirituality.

00:22:12.950 --> 00:22:16.170 align:middle line:10%
[SOUND EFFECT]

the evidence to determine its

00:22:19.550 --> 00:22:21.110 align:middle line:90%
authenticity.

00:22:21.110 --> 00:22:24.710 align:middle line:84%
If they are real, that
indicates that Antonio is not

00:22:24.710 --> 00:22:28.550 align:middle line:84%
only an exceptional person, but
that the extraterrestrial visit

00:22:28.550 --> 00:22:29.570 align:middle line:90%
is true.

00:22:29.570 --> 00:22:31.830 align:middle line:84%
In the next part of
this investigation,

00:22:31.830 --> 00:22:34.250 align:middle line:84%
we will know all
the analyses that

00:22:34.250 --> 00:22:37.520 align:middle line:84%
had been done on these
images, and the results

00:22:37.520 --> 00:22:39.650 align:middle line:90%
