He's a very old dog.

00:04:11.960 --> 00:04:14.790 align:middle line:84%
He has some bladder
problem, so the dog

00:04:14.790 --> 00:04:16.390 align:middle line:90%
has to pee all the time.

00:04:16.390 --> 00:04:20.339 align:middle line:84%

yeah, 9:30, 10:00 with my wife.

00:04:20.339 --> 00:04:22.485 align:middle line:90%
And I probably woke up around--

00:04:22.485 --> 00:04:25.350 align:middle line:84%
I don't know--
2:30 in the morning

00:04:25.350 --> 00:04:28.440 align:middle line:84%
because the dog was
whining in the living room.

00:04:28.440 --> 00:04:30.360 align:middle line:84%
So and every time
the dog is whining,

00:04:30.360 --> 00:04:33.100 align:middle line:84%
it makes this sound,
like ew-ew-ew.

00:04:33.100 --> 00:04:37.200 align:middle line:84%
So I know the dog had to go
pee, so I had to walk the dog.

00:04:37.200 --> 00:04:41.970 align:middle line:84%
So I got dressed, took the dog
outside, and then walked around

00:04:41.970 --> 00:04:43.850 align:middle line:90%
the neighborhood a little bit.

00:04:43.850 --> 00:04:48.210 align:middle line:84%
And the Air Force Memorial
is not far from my house.

00:04:48.210 --> 00:04:50.220 align:middle line:90%
Usually I walk past--

00:04:50.220 --> 00:04:51.990 align:middle line:84%
I always walk the same
route with my dog.

00:04:51.990 --> 00:04:54.150 align:middle line:84%
Like, usually I walk past
the Air Force memorial.

00:04:54.150 --> 00:04:57.180 align:middle line:84%
Then I walk around the block,
and then I go back home.

00:04:57.180 --> 00:05:00.810 align:middle line:84%
It usually takes, like, 45
minutes, like, the walk, maybe

00:05:00.810 --> 00:05:04.280 align:middle line:84%
an hour, depends, you
know, how fast I walk.

00:05:04.280 --> 00:05:07.170 align:middle line:84%
I was a bit tired,
and so I was walking

00:05:07.170 --> 00:05:09.390 align:middle line:90%
a bit slowly that night.

00:05:09.390 --> 00:05:12.300 align:middle line:84%
So I think I was probably
at the Air Force Memorial

00:05:12.300 --> 00:05:13.200 align:middle line:90%
around, like--

00:05:13.200 --> 00:05:17.470 align:middle line:84%
I'm not sure-- like,
3:30, maybe 3:45.

00:05:17.470 --> 00:05:20.040 align:middle line:84%
And the dog was peeing
in some corner there.

00:05:20.040 --> 00:05:23.100 align:middle line:90%
And I noticed some drunk guy.

00:05:23.100 --> 00:05:28.080 align:middle line:84%
He was walking or rather
stumbling near the trash cans.

00:05:28.080 --> 00:05:30.000 align:middle line:84%
I think he had had
a lot to drink,

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:31.830 align:middle line:84%
so he kept falling
into the trash cans.

00:05:31.830 --> 00:05:32.630 align:middle line:90%
I'm not sure.

00:05:32.630 --> 00:05:34.970 align:middle line:84%
Maybe he was looking for
something in the trash cans.

00:05:34.970 --> 00:05:37.420 align:middle line:84%
And the drunk guy was
mumbling to himself.

00:05:37.420 --> 00:05:39.110 align:middle line:84%
He was talking to
himself, I suppose

00:05:39.110 --> 00:05:41.250 align:middle line:90%
like lots of drunk people do.

00:05:41.250 --> 00:05:43.500 align:middle line:84%
I personally don't
drink so I don't have

00:05:43.500 --> 00:05:46.890 align:middle line:90%
any experience with alcohol.

00:05:46.890 --> 00:05:48.990 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, so I just looked
at the drunk guy,

00:05:48.990 --> 00:05:51.720 align:middle line:84%
waiting for my dog to
finish his business.

00:05:51.720 --> 00:05:53.970 align:middle line:84%
And then I saw [INAUDIBLE]
because the Pentagon is not

00:05:53.970 --> 00:05:56.280 align:middle line:90%
that far--

00:05:56.280 --> 00:05:58.620 align:middle line:84%
not that far from the
Air Force Memorial.

00:05:58.620 --> 00:06:01.500 align:middle line:84%
But I saw something in the
distance, like in the sky,

00:06:01.500 --> 00:06:02.543 align:middle line:90%
something black.

00:06:02.543 --> 00:06:03.960 align:middle line:84%
And I was squinting
because it was

00:06:03.960 --> 00:06:05.730 align:middle line:84%
very difficult to
see because there

00:06:05.730 --> 00:06:07.530 align:middle line:90%
were a few clouds in the sky.

00:06:07.530 --> 00:06:10.870 align:middle line:84%
But I could make out the shape
of a pyramid, this three--

00:06:10.870 --> 00:06:12.660 align:middle line:90%
a three-sided pyramid.

00:06:12.660 --> 00:06:17.010 align:middle line:84%
The bottom of the pyramid
was lighter than the sides.

00:06:17.010 --> 00:06:19.560 align:middle line:84%
And it was rotating
on its own axis.

00:06:19.560 --> 00:06:20.400 align:middle line:90%
It was floating.

00:06:20.400 --> 00:06:22.320 align:middle line:10%
So it wasn't moving
left or right,

00:06:22.320 --> 00:06:25.890 align:middle line:10%
up and down, just
rotating on its own axis,

00:06:25.890 --> 00:06:29.310 align:middle line:10%
like, above the Pentagon.

00:06:29.310 --> 00:06:31.610 align:middle line:84%
So I took up my mobile
because I was...

00:06:31.610 --> 00:06:33.650 align:middle line:90%
I was very surprised, of course.

00:06:33.650 --> 00:06:36.360 align:middle line:84%
So I was, like, wow, my,
what the hell is that?

00:06:36.360 --> 00:06:40.110 align:middle line:84%
So I took out my mobile,
and I tried to film it.

00:06:40.110 --> 00:06:43.650 align:middle line:84%
I was about filming it for
maybe four or five minutes

00:06:43.650 --> 00:06:44.825 align:middle line:90%
when my wife called.

00:06:44.825 --> 00:06:47.340 align:middle line:84%
At that time, I think
it was like around 4:00

00:06:47.340 --> 00:06:51.210 align:middle line:84%
in the morning at that
time, December 19th.

00:06:51.210 --> 00:06:54.860 align:middle line:84%
My wife called during the
filming while I was filming

00:06:54.860 --> 00:06:58.330 align:middle line:84%
and so I had to pick up
because she's-- how do I say--

00:06:58.330 --> 00:06:59.370 align:middle line:90%
a rather strict wife.

00:06:59.370 --> 00:07:01.650 align:middle line:84%
And so when she calls,
I have to answer.

00:07:01.650 --> 00:07:05.830 align:middle line:84%
And so I answer, and she
was worried because of--

00:07:05.830 --> 00:07:08.580 align:middle line:84%
she says, where are you, you
know, because she had woken up

00:07:08.580 --> 00:07:09.528 align:middle line:90%
and I wasn't in bed.

00:07:09.528 --> 00:07:11.070 align:middle line:84%
So I just told her,
you know, I said,

00:07:11.070 --> 00:07:13.695 align:middle line:84%
I'm just walking the dog because
the dog was whining, you know.

00:07:13.695 --> 00:07:14.660 align:middle line:90%
The dog had to pee.

00:07:14.660 --> 00:07:16.410 align:middle line:84%
And I tried to tell
her about the pyramid,

00:07:16.410 --> 00:07:18.540 align:middle line:84%
but I guess she was sleepy
or she didn't really

00:07:18.540 --> 00:07:20.458 align:middle line:84%
understand what I was
saying on the phone

00:07:20.458 --> 00:07:21.750 align:middle line:90%
because she didn't really care.

00:07:21.750 --> 00:07:23.542 align:middle line:84%
She just said, "I don't
care, I don't care.

00:07:23.542 --> 00:07:25.260 align:middle line:84%
Come home immediately,
basically.

00:07:25.260 --> 00:07:28.495 align:middle line:84%
I'm worried because there's
some bad people sometimes around

00:07:28.495 --> 00:07:29.370 align:middle line:90%
in the neighborhood."

00:07:29.370 --> 00:07:32.580 align:middle line:84%
It can be dangerous,
I suppose, she thinks.

00:07:32.580 --> 00:07:33.990 align:middle line:90%
I think it's safe.

00:07:33.990 --> 00:07:36.870 align:middle line:84%
She thinks it's unsafe,
because sometimes there

00:07:36.870 --> 00:07:41.370 align:middle line:84%
are like, these gangster or
hoodlum types roaming around.

00:07:41.370 --> 00:07:43.120 align:middle line:10%
So she wanted me to
come home immediately.

00:07:43.120 --> 00:07:44.940 align:middle line:90%
So I said, "OK, OK, I'll come."

00:07:44.940 --> 00:07:48.090 align:middle line:84%
I stayed a couple more minutes,
maybe another five minutes,

00:07:48.090 --> 00:07:51.480 align:middle line:84%
and I continued filming it,
but then I had to leave.

00:07:51.480 --> 00:07:56.300 align:middle line:84%
So I stopped and, yeah, just
basically walked straight home.

>> You recorded this with
your iPhone or your mobile.

00:07:59.240 --> 00:08:02.710 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, yeah, yeah,
exactly, correct, yes.

00:08:02.710 --> 00:08:03.940 align:middle line:90%
Well, I did that--

00:08:03.940 --> 00:08:05.670 align:middle line:90%
nobody has a camera nowadays.

00:08:05.670 --> 00:08:07.760 align:middle line:84%
I mean everybody uses
mobile phones, I guess.

>> He was then asked about the
voice heard in the recording.

00:08:12.570 --> 00:08:15.120 align:middle line:84%
Faruh would have
encountered a homeless man

00:08:15.120 --> 00:08:17.280 align:middle line:84%
whose voice can be
heard in the recording

00:08:17.280 --> 00:08:21.320 align:middle line:84%
and who explicitly refers to the
object as an alien spacecraft.

00:08:21.320 --> 00:08:24.170 align:middle line:90%


00:08:24.170 --> 00:08:27.500 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, you know, to be honest,
I'm not sure what it was.

00:08:27.500 --> 00:08:29.870 align:middle line:84%
I don't really have
any theories of my own.

00:08:29.870 --> 00:08:34.549 align:middle line:84%
And I am pretty much what
you'd call a skeptic.

00:08:34.549 --> 00:08:39.260 align:middle line:84%
So usually, I don't believe in
conspiracy theories or UFOs.

00:08:39.260 --> 00:08:41.990 align:middle line:84%
UFOs meeting like
aliens, you know?

00:08:41.990 --> 00:08:45.230 align:middle line:84%
Because UFO just means
unidentified flying objects.

00:08:45.230 --> 00:08:47.630 align:middle line:10%
And it definitely was an
unidentified flying object.

00:08:47.630 --> 00:08:50.060 align:middle line:90%
So it technically was a UFO.

00:08:50.060 --> 00:08:53.690 align:middle line:84%
Like, I personally don't
believe it was aliens,

00:08:53.690 --> 00:08:56.030 align:middle line:84%
just because I don't believe
that aliens are here.

00:08:56.030 --> 00:08:58.700 align:middle line:84%
So I believe it's
probably some--

00:08:58.700 --> 00:08:59.540 align:middle line:90%
I don't know--

00:08:59.540 --> 00:09:04.820 align:middle line:84%
CIA-related, US
military, maybe a weapon

00:09:04.820 --> 00:09:06.800 align:middle line:84%
or some other kind
of flying machine,

00:09:06.800 --> 00:09:10.170 align:middle line:84%
some kind of new plane,
spy plane, not sure.

00:09:10.170 --> 00:09:11.378 align:middle line:90%
But that's just what I think.

00:09:11.378 --> 00:09:12.587 align:middle line:90%
But, of course, I don't know.

00:09:12.587 --> 00:09:13.700 align:middle line:90%
It's just what I believe.

00:09:13.700 --> 00:09:17.370 align:middle line:84%
Because just because it
was above the Pentagon,

00:09:17.370 --> 00:09:19.700 align:middle line:84%
and it's Washington
DC, and there's

00:09:19.700 --> 00:09:22.290 align:middle line:84%
a lot of military around, a
lot of military installations

00:09:22.290 --> 00:09:26.270 align:middle line:84%
around, so that's
why I believe it.

00:09:26.270 --> 00:09:29.540 align:middle line:84%
>> Could this be a
holographic projection?

00:09:29.540 --> 00:09:33.120 align:middle line:90%


00:09:33.120 --> 00:09:35.300 align:middle line:90%
>> I suppose it may be.

00:09:35.300 --> 00:09:38.280 align:middle line:84%
Well, I don't know, because
it looked solid to me.

00:09:38.280 --> 00:09:41.430 align:middle line:84%
But if it was a
holographic projection,

00:09:41.430 --> 00:09:43.050 align:middle line:84%
it was a really
good one, I suppose.

00:09:43.050 --> 00:09:46.050 align:middle line:84%
I mean I've never
seen such technology,

00:09:46.050 --> 00:09:47.400 align:middle line:90%
such holographic technology.

00:09:47.400 --> 00:09:51.090 align:middle line:84%
And I don't know if such
holographic technology exists.

00:09:51.090 --> 00:09:53.520 align:middle line:84%
But I suppose, yes, it's
possible it could have been,

00:09:53.520 --> 00:09:53.850 align:middle line:90%
yes.

00:09:53.850 --> 00:09:55.950 align:middle line:84%
But if it was, it looked
like the real thing.

00:09:55.950 --> 00:10:00.080 align:middle line:84%
I mean it looked
completely real and solid.

00:10:00.080 --> 00:10:02.970 align:middle line:84%
>> Have someone approached to
you after you recorded this

00:10:02.970 --> 00:10:06.580 align:middle line:84%
video and present
it in the internet?

00:10:06.580 --> 00:10:07.750 align:middle line:90%
>> No, no.

00:10:07.750 --> 00:10:09.970 align:middle line:84%
I just read the
comments, nothing else.

00:10:09.970 --> 00:10:10.770 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:10:10.770 --> 00:10:12.450 align:middle line:84%
Because nobody
knows where I live.

00:10:12.450 --> 00:10:14.550 align:middle line:90%
And nobody knows my last name.

00:10:14.550 --> 00:10:17.340 align:middle line:84%
So nobody can contact me
even if they wanted to.

00:10:17.340 --> 00:10:19.770 align:middle line:84%
Because I don't want
people contacting me.

00:10:19.770 --> 00:10:22.860 align:middle line:84%
So I just moved to the US
like a couple of years ago.

00:10:22.860 --> 00:10:24.390 align:middle line:84%
And I don't want
to draw attention

00:10:24.390 --> 00:10:27.840 align:middle line:90%
to myself or anything.

00:10:27.840 --> 00:10:30.630 align:middle line:84%

you have given about this

00:10:40.680 --> 00:10:42.250 align:middle line:90%
event?

00:10:42.250 --> 00:10:43.530 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:10:43.530 --> 00:10:44.390 align:middle line:90%
It's the first one.

Do you know any of
the other witness that

00:10:55.150 --> 00:10:57.930 align:middle line:90%
presented-- got the videos?

00:10:57.930 --> 00:10:59.070 align:middle line:90%
>> No.

00:10:59.070 --> 00:11:00.270 align:middle line:10%
You mean personally?

00:11:00.270 --> 00:11:01.260 align:middle line:10%
>> Yeah.

00:11:01.260 --> 00:11:03.613 align:middle line:10%
>> No, no, no, no, no.

00:11:03.613 --> 00:11:04.655 align:middle line:10%
>> You don't know anyone.

00:11:04.655 --> 00:11:05.613 align:middle line:90%
>> I don't know anyone.

00:11:05.613 --> 00:11:08.940 align:middle line:84%
>> And you had not contact
anyone after this video?

00:11:08.940 --> 00:11:10.110 align:middle line:90%
Nothing.

00:11:10.110 --> 00:11:10.500 align:middle line:90%
>> Nobody.

00:11:10.500 --> 00:11:12.240 align:middle line:84%
Because I just called
my wife, basically,

00:11:12.240 --> 00:11:15.612 align:middle line:84%
when I came home and I showed
it to her, the same night,

00:11:15.612 --> 00:11:17.070 align:middle line:84%
of course, but she
was very sleepy.

00:11:17.070 --> 00:11:18.893 align:middle line:90%
And she was like, uh-uh-uh.

00:11:18.893 --> 00:11:20.310 align:middle line:84%
And the next morning
at breakfast,

00:11:20.310 --> 00:11:21.390 align:middle line:90%
she said the same thing.

00:11:21.390 --> 00:11:25.300 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, it's probably some
CIA, military related stuff,

00:11:25.300 --> 00:11:28.750 align:middle line:84%
so we basically were in
agreement on this one.

00:11:28.750 --> 00:11:29.550 align:middle line:90%
But that's it.

00:11:29.550 --> 00:11:33.720 align:middle line:84%
So other than that, I hadn't
spoken about it to anybody.

00:11:33.720 --> 00:11:38.640 align:middle line:84%
>> Even if this was holographic,
even if this was from the CIA,

00:11:38.640 --> 00:11:41.810 align:middle line:84%
why we have not seen
any report from that?

00:11:41.810 --> 00:11:43.860 align:middle line:90%
Even if that?

00:11:43.860 --> 00:11:48.500 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, isn't that usually,
if it's from the CIA, usually,

00:11:48.500 --> 00:11:49.420 align:middle line:90%
they don't admit it.

00:11:49.420 --> 00:11:51.510 align:middle line:84%
So they're not going to
comment on it, if it was.

00:11:51.510 --> 00:11:54.210 align:middle line:84%
>> But the media
could present it.

00:11:54.210 --> 00:11:59.100 align:middle line:90%
The information to be there.

00:11:59.100 --> 00:12:01.410 align:middle line:84%
I mean it should have
been in the media

00:12:01.410 --> 00:12:03.930 align:middle line:84%
in the "Washington
Post" or something,

00:12:03.930 --> 00:12:08.790 align:middle line:84%
you know, the CIA flew this
above the Pentagon or anyone.

00:12:08.790 --> 00:12:10.200 align:middle line:90%
There is nothing.

00:12:10.200 --> 00:12:12.463 align:middle line:90%
I am surprised.

00:12:12.463 --> 00:12:13.380 align:middle line:90%
>> I can't answer you.

00:12:13.380 --> 00:12:14.390 align:middle line:90%
I can't answer it.

00:12:14.390 --> 00:12:14.940 align:middle line:90%
I don't know why.

00:12:14.940 --> 00:12:15.300 align:middle line:90%
I don't know.

00:12:15.300 --> 00:12:17.008 align:middle line:84%
I don't know why
there's a media silence.

00:12:17.008 --> 00:12:18.960 align:middle line:90%
I have no clue, actually.

00:12:18.960 --> 00:12:22.900 align:middle line:84%
>> Tell me about your
video, how long it is?

00:12:22.900 --> 00:12:26.910 align:middle line:84%
>> For five, five
to six minutes.

00:12:26.910 --> 00:12:28.210 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, it's very interesting.

00:12:28.210 --> 00:12:30.870 align:middle line:84%
We really like to
see it because we

00:12:30.870 --> 00:12:35.310 align:middle line:84%
want to work with it to make
it the most visible possible.

00:12:35.310 --> 00:12:38.040 align:middle line:84%
Because as you
said, this pyramid,

00:12:38.040 --> 00:12:42.230 align:middle line:84%
it was very difficult to
see this object in the sky.

00:12:42.230 --> 00:12:44.920 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, it wasn't difficult
to see at first because it was

00:12:44.920 --> 00:12:45.720 align:middle line:90%
at nighttime.

00:12:45.720 --> 00:12:46.520 align:middle line:90%
It was dark.

00:12:46.520 --> 00:12:48.255 align:middle line:84%
And there were
like a few clouds,

00:12:48.255 --> 00:12:49.560 align:middle line:90%
so it wasn't very cloudy.

00:12:49.560 --> 00:12:51.990 align:middle line:84%
So I couldn't make
it out at first.

00:12:51.990 --> 00:12:54.760 align:middle line:84%
But you know, when your
eyes adjust to the dark

00:12:54.760 --> 00:12:55.560 align:middle line:90%
and then you can--

00:12:55.560 --> 00:12:57.450 align:middle line:84%
because at first, you're
like, what is this?

00:12:57.450 --> 00:12:58.250 align:middle line:90%
You're not sure.

00:12:58.250 --> 00:13:00.790 align:middle line:84%
It's just like hmm,
some indistinct shape.

00:13:00.790 --> 00:13:05.610 align:middle line:84%
And then you squint your eyes
and you focus on the darkness.

00:13:05.610 --> 00:13:09.113 align:middle line:84%
And your eyes get used to it
and then you see it much better.

00:13:09.113 --> 00:13:10.030 align:middle line:90%
>> What did you do it?

00:13:10.030 --> 00:13:12.142 align:middle line:10%
Why did you present
it in YouTube?

00:13:12.142 --> 00:13:13.350 align:middle line:90%
>> Just because it's unusual.

00:13:13.350 --> 00:13:16.260 align:middle line:84%
And lots of people post stuff
on YouTube about their--

00:13:16.260 --> 00:13:19.620 align:middle line:84%
I don't know-- dancing
dogs, or singing cats,

00:13:19.620 --> 00:13:21.893 align:middle line:90%
and other unusual, fun stuff.

00:13:21.893 --> 00:13:23.310 align:middle line:84%
You know, just for
no reason, just

00:13:23.310 --> 00:13:27.870 align:middle line:84%
because I felt like it, just
to see how many people would

00:13:27.870 --> 00:13:28.740 align:middle line:90%
actually watch it.

In addition to
that, the witnesses

00:14:47.970 --> 00:14:49.980 align:middle line:84%
didn't know each
other, elements that

00:14:49.980 --> 00:14:53.160 align:middle line:84%
allow us to affirm with
a high level of certainty

00:14:53.160 --> 00:14:56.100 align:middle line:84%
that they are authentic,
not tampered with.

00:14:56.100 --> 00:14:58.350 align:middle line:84%
And they present the
true image of a pyramid

00:14:58.350 --> 00:15:01.860 align:middle line:84%
shaped, tetrahedron
between 100 and 200 meters

00:15:01.860 --> 00:15:04.890 align:middle line:84%

levitated over the most

00:15:04.890 --> 00:15:08.640 align:middle line:84%
important military installations
in the United States

00:15:08.640 --> 00:15:11.730 align:middle line:84%
without a single combat
aircraft having confronted

00:15:11.730 --> 00:15:15.990 align:middle line:84%
this presence, without
generating any type of response

00:15:15.990 --> 00:15:17.535 align:middle line:90%

00:15:20.330 --> 00:15:23.720 align:middle line:84%
The event was not presented
by any written or electronic

00:15:23.720 --> 00:15:27.940 align:middle line:84%
media, as was the case with
Russia in which, until now,

00:15:27.940 --> 00:15:30.470 align:middle line:84%
is unknown to most of
citizens of the United

conquest would be presented.

00:15:48.250 --> 00:15:51.670 align:middle line:84%
She is the owner and director
of the company Galactica

00:15:51.670 --> 00:15:55.060 align:middle line:84%
that aims to develop
habitats in space for humans,

00:15:55.060 --> 00:15:58.930 align:middle line:90%
here in an interview for CNN.

00:15:58.930 --> 00:16:02.650 align:middle line:84%
>> Since childhood, I had this
idea is so clear inside me that

00:16:02.650 --> 00:16:05.170 align:middle line:90%
space could be habitable.

00:16:05.170 --> 00:16:07.030 align:middle line:84%
It could be
habitable for people.

00:16:07.030 --> 00:16:09.490 align:middle line:84%
It could be habitable
for everyone.

00:16:09.490 --> 00:16:12.810 align:middle line:10%
And it could be the way like
we live here on the earth,

00:16:12.810 --> 00:16:16.660 align:middle line:10%
so like with trees, with cafes,
with restaurants, and so on.

00:16:16.660 --> 00:16:20.590 align:middle line:10%
And I had this idea like
that it's so normal.

00:16:20.590 --> 00:16:23.350 align:middle line:10%
Of course, in school
and in university,

00:16:23.350 --> 00:16:25.900 align:middle line:10%
I wasn't so kept with this idea.

00:16:25.900 --> 00:16:28.240 align:middle line:84%
I had different
businesses and tries.

00:16:28.240 --> 00:16:30.640 align:middle line:84%
But two years ago,
I decided finally

00:16:30.640 --> 00:16:35.290 align:middle line:84%
to do what I really want to do,
to do what is my passion about.

00:17:38.150 --> 00:17:42.110 align:middle line:10%
Now, I am welcoming a visionary

00:17:51.670 --> 00:17:54.250 align:middle line:10%
>> Honorable President of
the United Nations General

00:17:54.250 --> 00:17:58.360 align:middle line:10%
Assembly, Maria Fernanda
Espinosa Garces.

00:17:58.360 --> 00:18:02.020 align:middle line:10%
Ladies and gentlemen,
I have an announcement.

00:18:02.020 --> 00:18:07.090 align:middle line:10%
On December at 4:07 PM, an
extraterrestrial contact

00:18:07.090 --> 00:18:08.770 align:middle line:10%
occurred.

00:18:08.770 --> 00:18:12.910 align:middle line:10%
A metal object,
shaped like a pyramid,

00:18:12.910 --> 00:18:16.240 align:middle line:10%
appeared over the
Pentagon, Washington DC,

00:18:16.240 --> 00:18:18.580 align:middle line:10%
the United States of America.

00:18:18.580 --> 00:18:24.850 align:middle line:10%
An unidentified flying object,
diameter around 100 meters,

00:18:24.850 --> 00:18:27.580 align:middle line:10%
rotated around its own
axis at an altitude

00:18:27.580 --> 00:18:30.340 align:middle line:10%
of around 500 meters.

00:18:30.340 --> 00:18:33.340 align:middle line:10%
NASA operational task
group, specializing

00:18:33.340 --> 00:18:36.040 align:middle line:10%
in the receiving and
processing of the space data,

00:18:36.040 --> 00:18:38.530 align:middle line:10%
received an incoming
data from the object.

00:18:38.530 --> 00:18:41.260 align:middle line:10%
At the moment as I
speak here, now the data

00:18:41.260 --> 00:18:44.410 align:middle line:10%
has been processed and
investigated by NASA.

00:18:44.410 --> 00:18:47.290 align:middle line:10%
The information from the
radars, the visual information

00:18:47.290 --> 00:18:49.535 align:middle line:10%
and the fixation of
the radio signals

00:18:49.535 --> 00:18:54.040 align:middle line:10%
incoming from the unidentified
flying object were made.

00:18:54.040 --> 00:18:55.720 align:middle line:10%
According to the
data, we can say

00:18:55.720 --> 00:18:59.980 align:middle line:10%
that the object hovering
over the Pentagon

00:18:59.980 --> 00:19:04.390 align:middle line:10%
can be identified as an
aircraft of unknown origin,

00:19:04.390 --> 00:19:06.670 align:middle line:10%
hypothetically extraterrestrial.

00:19:06.670 --> 00:19:10.550 align:middle line:84%
However, there were no
signs of aggression.

00:19:10.550 --> 00:19:20.360 align:middle line:10%
The repeating radio burst,
named FRB 180814.J0422+73,

00:19:20.360 --> 00:19:25.700 align:middle line:10%
recorded by the specialists
of the CHIME Observatory,

00:19:25.700 --> 00:19:28.670 align:middle line:10%
British Columbia's
Okanagan Valley,

00:19:28.670 --> 00:19:31.950 align:middle line:10%
matches the pattern of the
signal fixated by NASA,

00:19:31.950 --> 00:19:35.240 align:middle line:10%
incoming from the object
hovering over the Pentagon.

00:19:35.240 --> 00:19:38.150 align:middle line:10%
Currently, work is already
underway to calculate

00:19:38.150 --> 00:19:41.000 align:middle line:10%
the coordinates of
the signal source

00:19:41.000 --> 00:19:44.870 align:middle line:10%
and the corresponding
inhabited celestial.

00:19:44.870 --> 00:19:49.310 align:middle line:10%
This video was released
on January 29, 2019.

However, the identity
of the person

who originally
uploaded the images

00:19:53.660 --> 00:19:56.480 align:middle line:10%
deleted all their
personal information.

00:19:56.480 --> 00:19:59.270 align:middle line:10%
It was only possible to
obtain the information

00:19:59.270 --> 00:20:02.660 align:middle line:10%
of the first YouTube user
who copied the video.

00:20:02.660 --> 00:20:05.800 align:middle line:90%
This is JassLatta65.

00:20:05.800 --> 00:20:09.210 align:middle line:10%
Just two days later,
on January 31,

00:20:09.210 --> 00:20:12.950 align:middle line:10%
the user ufoofinterest
claimed to have discovered

00:20:12.950 --> 00:20:14.060 align:middle line:10%
that it was a forgery.

Recep Tayyip Erdogan

00:20:22.310 --> 00:20:25.370 align:middle line:10%
would have been replaced with
that of the Russian scientist

Aliya Prokofyeva in
an exceptional work.

00:21:13.440 --> 00:21:17.220 align:middle line:84%
>> Now, let's see the precise
moment in which the images were

00:21:17.220 --> 00:21:18.030 align:middle line:90%
altered.

00:21:18.030 --> 00:21:21.810 align:middle line:84%
You can see how this is the
same video but in each one,

00:21:21.810 --> 00:21:24.000 align:middle line:90%
a different person appears.

00:21:24.000 --> 00:21:27.270 align:middle line:84%
It is a very high
level counterfeiting

00:21:27.270 --> 00:21:30.120 align:middle line:84%
made with very
sophisticated equipment.

00:21:30.120 --> 00:21:35.580 align:middle line:84%
Carefully compare both
Images the forgery is clear.

00:21:35.580 --> 00:21:39.240 align:middle line:84%
But also note the perfection
with which it was made.

00:21:39.240 --> 00:21:41.880 align:middle line:84%
It would be very
difficult to discover.

00:21:41.880 --> 00:21:46.050 align:middle line:84%
However, ufoofinterest claims
that he used a special Google

00:21:46.050 --> 00:21:48.900 align:middle line:84%
software to find
the original image.

00:21:48.900 --> 00:21:51.600 align:middle line:84%
And from there, it was
very easy to discover

00:21:51.600 --> 00:21:53.650 align:middle line:90%
that the video was a fake.

00:21:53.650 --> 00:21:55.920 align:middle line:84%
It is evident that
this extraordinary work

00:21:55.920 --> 00:22:00.180 align:middle line:84%
was done by professionals of
a very high level, most likely

00:22:00.180 --> 00:22:03.480 align:middle line:84%
to discredit the
original videos.

00:22:03.480 --> 00:22:06.870 align:middle line:84%
The fact of having involved
a scientist like Dr. Aliya

00:22:06.870 --> 00:22:10.950 align:middle line:84%
Prokofyeva affecting
her personal prestige

00:22:10.950 --> 00:22:12.960 align:middle line:84%
suggests that this
video was made

00:22:12.960 --> 00:22:17.400 align:middle line:84%
by true professionals, possibly
a specialized agency that

00:22:17.400 --> 00:22:21.170 align:middle line:84%
is dedicated to carrying
out this type of animation.

00:22:21.170 --> 00:22:24.930 align:middle line:10%
Here, it cannot be considered
that it was made by an amateur

00:22:24.930 --> 00:22:28.260 align:middle line:10%
who wanted to attract
attention or viralize the image

00:22:28.260 --> 00:22:31.470 align:middle line:10%
for economic reasons, but to
generate confusion towards

00:22:31.470 --> 00:22:34.050 align:middle line:10%
the authenticity of the
event that occurred over

00:22:34.050 --> 00:22:36.862 align:middle line:10%

The presence of this great
pyramid, of this tetrahedron,

00:22:47.950 --> 00:22:51.100 align:middle line:84%
could be a warning to the
highest military commanders,

00:22:51.100 --> 00:22:55.040 align:middle line:84%
not only of the United
States but also of Russia.

00:22:55.040 --> 00:22:58.210 align:middle line:84%
A case that we must consider
as the most important

00:22:58.210 --> 00:23:02.570 align:middle line:84%
of all time because of its
extraordinary significance.

00:23:02.570 --> 00:23:05.800 align:middle line:84%

going to discover that.
