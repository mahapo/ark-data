>> About 100.

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:09.380 align:middle line:90%
They worked three shifts.

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:18.850 align:middle line:84%
I think it grew to about 200
by the mid 50s and through 1957

>> Why did they install these
radar right after the war?

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:33.570 align:middle line:84%
>> These were here
for one main purpose.

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:39.750 align:middle line:84%
And that was to protect Los
Alamos, Sandia National Labs,

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:42.998 align:middle line:90%
and Kirkland Air Force Base.

00:01:42.998 --> 00:01:45.290 align:middle line:84%
And if you look at where they
are on a map, which we'll

00:01:45.290 --> 00:01:53.360 align:middle line:84%
do later, El Vado was north, is
far north, Moriarty was east,

00:01:53.360 --> 00:01:56.930 align:middle line:90%
and Continental Divide was west.

00:01:56.930 --> 00:01:59.740 align:middle line:90%
>> They were afraid of what?

00:01:59.740 --> 00:02:02.270 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, we were at the
beginning-- well, actually,

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:04.370 align:middle line:90%
well into the Cold War.

00:02:04.370 --> 00:02:07.880 align:middle line:84%
So we were protecting
these bases

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:12.665 align:middle line:84%
against espionage, spy planes,
or bomber raids by the Soviets.

were experimental,

very powerful by the way?

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:21.260 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes, these were brand new.

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:25.190 align:middle line:90%


00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:28.460 align:middle line:84%
They weren't the military
surplus that some people claim.

00:02:28.460 --> 00:02:32.030 align:middle line:84%
I've done extensive
research on this.

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:37.250 align:middle line:84%
They had brand new height
finder, range finder, locator.

00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:39.050 align:middle line:84%
And then they had,
where we were standing

00:02:39.050 --> 00:02:41.540 align:middle line:84%
before, that was the
experimental lash-up that

00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:43.400 align:middle line:90%
was up here for the Navy.

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:44.300 align:middle line:90%
>> Very powerful.

00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:45.980 align:middle line:90%
>> Very, very powerful, yeah.

00:02:45.980 --> 00:02:48.380 align:middle line:84%
That was to be used
and experimented

00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:50.540 align:middle line:84%
for the Navy where
they could look over

00:02:50.540 --> 00:02:54.170 align:middle line:84%
the horizon for metallic,
anything metallic,

00:02:54.170 --> 00:02:56.720 align:middle line:90%

00:02:56.720 --> 00:02:59.980 align:middle line:84%
>> Was UFO the purpose
of these radars too?

00:02:59.980 --> 00:03:03.160 align:middle line:84%
>> No, no, I think
that was a secondary--

00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:05.210 align:middle line:84%
this, right here
where we are now--

00:03:05.210 --> 00:03:07.970 align:middle line:84%
I could show you on maps--
was all restricted airspace.

00:03:07.970 --> 00:03:12.740 align:middle line:84%
Because Los Alamos is
just straight down there.

00:03:12.740 --> 00:03:16.910 align:middle line:84%
They did in their quarterly
journals report UFOs

00:03:16.910 --> 00:03:19.430 align:middle line:84%
that they had picked
up on the radar, which

00:03:19.430 --> 00:03:20.960 align:middle line:90%
I found interesting.

00:03:20.960 --> 00:03:23.780 align:middle line:84%
But those reports did not go
to Wright-Patterson Air Force

00:03:23.780 --> 00:03:25.160 align:middle line:90%
Base.

00:03:25.160 --> 00:03:27.410 align:middle line:84%
Those reports went right
up here to Colorado

00:03:27.410 --> 00:03:30.620 align:middle line:84%
to the Ent Air Force Base
near Colorado Springs.

00:03:30.620 --> 00:03:34.460 align:middle line:84%
Actually, it's at the other
end of Colorado Springs.

00:03:34.460 --> 00:03:39.590 align:middle line:84%
They had a group up there,
AISS, Air Intelligence Service

00:03:39.590 --> 00:03:40.880 align:middle line:90%
Squadron.

00:03:40.880 --> 00:03:43.280 align:middle line:84%
And they went under
then the call letters

00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:48.230 align:middle line:84%
of the 4602 small "d"
was their group number.

00:03:48.230 --> 00:03:53.870 align:middle line:84%
That was a very secretive
investigative group

00:03:53.870 --> 00:03:55.730 align:middle line:90%
for the United States Air Force.

00:03:55.730 --> 00:03:57.200 align:middle line:84%
They're still in
existence today,

00:03:57.200 --> 00:04:01.460 align:middle line:90%
but they don't go under 4602.

00:04:01.460 --> 00:04:07.580 align:middle line:84%
They were discovered by a
researcher, Donald Keyhoe,

00:04:07.580 --> 00:04:09.950 align:middle line:84%
retired from the United
States Marine Corps

00:04:09.950 --> 00:04:13.230 align:middle line:84%
at one point where he
mentioned their existence.

00:04:13.230 --> 00:04:15.920 align:middle line:84%
So then they changed
their designation

00:04:15.920 --> 00:04:19.870 align:middle line:90%
to the 1006th, 1006.

00:04:19.870 --> 00:04:22.760 align:middle line:84%
And I have no idea
what it is today,

00:04:22.760 --> 00:04:24.980 align:middle line:90%
not much published about them.

00:04:24.980 --> 00:04:28.100 align:middle line:84%
But that's where the UFO
reports from this base

00:04:28.100 --> 00:04:31.430 align:middle line:90%
would go, directly up to AISS.

00:04:31.430 --> 00:04:36.770 align:middle line:84%
>> You said the main purpose
was to track UFOs from here.

00:04:36.770 --> 00:04:40.970 align:middle line:84%
But at the same time,
could these radars

00:04:40.970 --> 00:04:44.270 align:middle line:90%
have affected the UFOs?

00:04:44.270 --> 00:04:47.060 align:middle line:84%
Could these be the
reason of the crashes

00:04:47.060 --> 00:04:53.960 align:middle line:84%
we have in New Mexico from
1945 to 1948 or probably later.

00:04:53.960 --> 00:04:56.810 align:middle line:84%
>> I've never been
able to prove that.

00:04:56.810 --> 00:05:01.310 align:middle line:84%
The original radar base
was down at El Vado Lake.

00:05:01.310 --> 00:05:05.300 align:middle line:84%
This one it was under-- probably
well under construction in 1948

00:05:05.300 --> 00:05:06.412 align:middle line:90%
when Aztec happened.

00:05:06.412 --> 00:05:08.120 align:middle line:84%
Because I noticed when
they moved up here

00:05:08.120 --> 00:05:11.180 align:middle line:84%
they are already
calling for repairs.

00:05:11.180 --> 00:05:13.460 align:middle line:84%
And this probably took a
couple of years to build.

00:05:13.460 --> 00:05:15.410 align:middle line:84%
You're only seeing
just a fraction

00:05:15.410 --> 00:05:16.760 align:middle line:90%
of how large this base is.

00:05:16.760 --> 00:05:19.290 align:middle line:90%


00:05:19.290 --> 00:05:22.430 align:middle line:84%
I have never been able to
tie-- because the original one

00:05:22.430 --> 00:05:26.363 align:middle line:84%
that we know is in
operation from '46 on,

00:05:26.363 --> 00:05:28.280 align:middle line:84%
I don't think they had
a powerful enough radar

00:05:28.280 --> 00:05:29.730 align:middle line:90%
to knock it out.

00:05:29.730 --> 00:05:30.620 align:middle line:90%
But we can't tell.

00:05:30.620 --> 00:05:31.638 align:middle line:90%
We can't prove it.

00:05:31.638 --> 00:05:32.930 align:middle line:90%
You know, we came looking for--

00:05:32.930 --> 00:05:33.770 align:middle line:90%
>> It's possible.

00:05:33.770 --> 00:05:35.537 align:middle line:90%
>> I guess anything is possible.

a secret that there are very few

00:05:43.650 --> 00:05:47.250 align:middle line:84%
historical references
about their operation.

00:05:47.250 --> 00:05:51.210 align:middle line:84%
Thanks to years of searching,
Scott and Suzanne Ramsey

00:05:51.210 --> 00:05:54.630 align:middle line:84%
found evidence that
they were real.

00:05:54.630 --> 00:05:57.345 align:middle line:84%
>> Finally, you proved that
these secret that radar bases

00:05:57.345 --> 00:05:58.145 align:middle line:90%
existed?

00:05:58.145 --> 00:05:59.240 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:05:59.240 --> 00:06:02.140 align:middle line:84%
>> Because many people
had mentioned them,

00:06:02.140 --> 00:06:05.660 align:middle line:90%
but nobody had found them.

00:06:05.660 --> 00:06:06.800 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, that's true.

00:06:06.800 --> 00:06:09.790 align:middle line:84%
And we photographed and mapped
this place the best we could

00:06:09.790 --> 00:06:10.590 align:middle line:90%
that day.

00:06:10.590 --> 00:06:13.810 align:middle line:90%
It was very, very snowy up here.

00:06:13.810 --> 00:06:16.700 align:middle line:84%
I went down to Maxwell
Air Force Base.

00:06:16.700 --> 00:06:18.920 align:middle line:84%
They had trouble locating
it because there was a--

00:06:18.920 --> 00:06:20.600 align:middle line:90%
there had been a transition.

00:06:20.600 --> 00:06:22.640 align:middle line:84%
The original bases
were built and run

00:06:22.640 --> 00:06:26.540 align:middle line:84%
by the Atomic Energy
Commission then taken over

00:06:26.540 --> 00:06:28.490 align:middle line:90%
by the Air Force.

00:06:28.490 --> 00:06:31.490 align:middle line:84%
And the three bases
I don't think we're

00:06:31.490 --> 00:06:35.060 align:middle line:84%
intentionally packed
away in some archive,

00:06:35.060 --> 00:06:37.700 align:middle line:84%
but because there had been
a transition between Atomic

00:06:37.700 --> 00:06:42.320 align:middle line:84%
Energy Commission and the Air
Force, they had been misplaced.

00:06:42.320 --> 00:06:44.700 align:middle line:84%
But once we showed the Air
Force, here's the pictures,

00:06:44.700 --> 00:06:47.033 align:middle line:84%
here's the map,
here's a rough sketch

00:06:47.033 --> 00:06:48.200 align:middle line:90%
where all the buildings are.

00:06:48.200 --> 00:06:52.760 align:middle line:84%
We have the powerhouse, the
radar building, the steam room,

00:06:52.760 --> 00:06:55.760 align:middle line:84%
the machine shop, the
barracks, and all the buildings

00:06:55.760 --> 00:06:59.580 align:middle line:90%
that go down forever and ever.

00:06:59.580 --> 00:07:01.870 align:middle line:84%
They were very helpful in
locating it and saying,

00:07:01.870 --> 00:07:03.500 align:middle line:90%
oh, here it is.

00:07:03.500 --> 00:07:05.300 align:middle line:90%
>> Without any doubt.

00:07:05.300 --> 00:07:07.590 align:middle line:90%
>> Without any doubt, yeah.

00:07:07.590 --> 00:07:10.070 align:middle line:84%
They gave us the
historical records and maps

00:07:10.070 --> 00:07:13.070 align:middle line:90%
and the whole bit, sure.

00:07:13.070 --> 00:07:15.585 align:middle line:84%
>> How powerful
it was this radar?

00:07:15.585 --> 00:07:17.960 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, it was powerful enough
that even though this was

00:07:17.960 --> 00:07:21.470 align:middle line:84%
a restricted airspace for
private aircraft or commercial,

00:07:21.470 --> 00:07:25.790 align:middle line:84%
for that matter, there
were manuals written on how

00:07:25.790 --> 00:07:30.590 align:middle line:84%
to quickly shut the radar down
if a private aircraft wandered

00:07:30.590 --> 00:07:32.630 align:middle line:90%
into this airspace.

00:07:32.630 --> 00:07:35.390 align:middle line:84%
>> What could happen
to that airplane?

00:07:35.390 --> 00:07:37.820 align:middle line:84%
>> Probably knock out the
electrical system and possibly

00:07:37.820 --> 00:07:40.640 align:middle line:90%
harm the people on the plane.

00:07:40.640 --> 00:07:43.400 align:middle line:84%
>> And that's exactly what
happened to these UFOs,

00:07:43.400 --> 00:07:46.460 align:middle line:84%
at least what most people
believe it happened?

00:07:46.460 --> 00:07:49.880 align:middle line:90%
>> Could be, could be.

00:07:49.880 --> 00:07:54.430 align:middle line:84%
It's a good theory, but
it's a tough one to prove.

00:07:54.430 --> 00:08:00.440 align:middle line:84%
>> And also, we have the
memorandum from the FBI where

00:08:00.440 --> 00:08:06.125 align:middle line:84%
they mention the possibility
that these secret radars were--

00:08:06.125 --> 00:08:07.250 align:middle line:90%
>> Mhm, had knocked it out.

00:08:07.250 --> 00:08:09.410 align:middle line:84%
>> --possible to
knock these UFOs down.

00:08:09.410 --> 00:08:12.950 align:middle line:84%
>> Right, yep, that document
was released back in, what,

00:08:12.950 --> 00:08:14.530 align:middle line:90%
the 70s.

00:08:14.530 --> 00:08:18.170 align:middle line:84%
And they talk about three
powerful radar bases.

00:08:18.170 --> 00:08:19.630 align:middle line:90%
We found three.

00:08:19.630 --> 00:08:22.480 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, this is an
amazing discovery.

00:08:22.480 --> 00:08:25.880 align:middle line:84%
You proved what
nobody else could.

00:08:25.880 --> 00:08:26.840 align:middle line:90%
We are very thankful.

00:08:26.840 --> 00:08:30.020 align:middle line:84%
Because this is just the
second time that a camera has--

00:08:30.020 --> 00:08:34.539 align:middle line:84%
>> --has ever been
here, yeah, that's true.

00:08:34.539 --> 00:08:38.140 align:middle line:84%
>> Scott Ramsey's investigation
confirms that photographs

00:08:38.140 --> 00:08:41.590 align:middle line:84%
of the saucer and alien beings
in the Aztec incident were

00:08:41.590 --> 00:08:44.200 align:middle line:84%
taken from the men
that saw the event.

00:08:44.200 --> 00:08:46.330 align:middle line:84%
And even though the cameras
and the rolls of film

00:08:46.330 --> 00:08:49.840 align:middle line:84%
were confiscated, it is
possible they still exist

00:08:49.840 --> 00:08:51.970 align:middle line:90%
and might one day be released.

00:08:51.970 --> 00:08:55.523 align:middle line:84%
Scott Ramsey revealed
other details.

00:08:55.523 --> 00:08:57.190 align:middle line:84%
>> When was the next
time you went back?

00:08:57.190 --> 00:09:00.210 align:middle line:84%
After you left and
the saucer was there,

00:09:00.210 --> 00:09:01.930 align:middle line:84%
when was the next
time you went back--

00:09:01.930 --> 00:09:03.180 align:middle line:90%
>> Never did go back in there.

00:09:03.180 --> 00:09:05.257 align:middle line:90%
They used to have the guard up.

00:09:05.257 --> 00:09:09.560 align:middle line:84%
You're not going to
get back in there.

00:09:09.560 --> 00:09:12.490 align:middle line:84%
>> So on this day,
you haven't been back?

00:09:12.490 --> 00:09:13.960 align:middle line:90%
>> No.

00:09:13.960 --> 00:09:15.240 align:middle line:90%
What's the use?

00:09:15.240 --> 00:09:17.580 align:middle line:90%
I saw it when it was there.

00:09:17.580 --> 00:09:20.290 align:middle line:84%
They wouldn't let us
take any pictures.

00:09:20.290 --> 00:09:23.820 align:middle line:84%
And the cameras that we had
that did have pictures in them,

00:09:23.820 --> 00:09:27.310 align:middle line:90%
they just confiscated all those.

00:09:27.310 --> 00:09:31.580 align:middle line:10%
>> There are documents that
indicate that the FBI, the CIA,

00:09:31.580 --> 00:09:35.020 align:middle line:10%
and the Army were involved in
an investigation concerning

00:09:35.020 --> 00:09:39.010 align:middle line:10%
photographs of the Aztec
UFO and its beings.

00:09:39.010 --> 00:09:44.180 align:middle line:10%
>> The most interesting ones I
find are the fact that the FBI,

00:09:44.180 --> 00:09:48.910 align:middle line:10%
the Air Force OSI, and possibly
the CIA had set up a sting

00:09:48.910 --> 00:09:53.800 align:middle line:10%
operation in downtown Denver to
recover pictures of the Aztec

00:09:53.800 --> 00:09:55.270 align:middle line:10%
crash--

00:09:55.270 --> 00:09:57.430 align:middle line:10%
their words, not ours--

00:09:57.430 --> 00:10:01.120 align:middle line:10%
and that a reporter from
the Baltimore Sun Times

00:10:01.120 --> 00:10:03.538 align:middle line:10%
had come out and was
trying to purchase them

00:10:03.538 --> 00:10:05.830 align:middle line:10%
for the purpose of publishing
them in the Baltimore Sun

00:10:05.830 --> 00:10:08.320 align:middle line:10%
Times.

00:10:08.320 --> 00:10:10.930 align:middle line:84%
That said, I'll let
you read the documents.

00:10:10.930 --> 00:10:13.990 align:middle line:84%
And we can pick up what
the documents mean.

00:10:13.990 --> 00:10:18.550 align:middle line:10%
Those documents, to me,
are much more interesting

00:10:18.550 --> 00:10:23.260 align:middle line:10%
because we have three
divisions of our government

00:10:23.260 --> 00:10:28.970 align:middle line:10%
trying to set up a
sting operation at a bar

00:10:28.970 --> 00:10:33.370 align:middle line:10%
and restaurant in
downtown Denver

00:10:33.370 --> 00:10:35.910 align:middle line:10%
and getting the
parties involved that

00:10:35.910 --> 00:10:40.020 align:middle line:10%
were trying to purchase the
pictures, the person involved

00:10:40.020 --> 00:10:41.940 align:middle line:10%
in selling the pictures.

00:10:41.940 --> 00:10:45.810 align:middle line:84%
And the fact that the Air Force
and the FBI in their words

00:10:45.810 --> 00:10:51.630 align:middle line:84%
say, at the end, the person
selling and buying both

00:10:51.630 --> 00:10:55.350 align:middle line:84%
claimed that it was a hoax,
but we don't believe them.

00:10:55.350 --> 00:10:59.490 align:middle line:84%
The FBI and Air Force believed
that there were pictures.

00:10:59.490 --> 00:11:02.760 align:middle line:10%
>> In the declassified document
of the United States Air Force

00:11:02.760 --> 00:11:07.470 align:middle line:10%
from September 30, 1950 it is
established that an individual,

00:11:07.470 --> 00:11:10.800 align:middle line:10%
identified as Klein from
the Baltimore Sun newspaper,

00:11:10.800 --> 00:11:14.940 align:middle line:10%
wanted to pay $1,500 for
photographs of the Aztec alien

00:11:14.940 --> 00:11:17.400 align:middle line:10%
ship from Agent McGuffin.

00:11:17.400 --> 00:11:20.010 align:middle line:10%
McGuffin assured him that
he had a roll of film

00:11:20.010 --> 00:11:22.680 align:middle line:10%
with photographs that
he had taken of the ship

00:11:22.680 --> 00:11:25.410 align:middle line:10%
and that he had hidden
them from the Army.

00:11:25.410 --> 00:11:28.560 align:middle line:84%
He assured McGuffin that
he had been at the site

00:11:28.560 --> 00:11:30.540 align:middle line:90%
where the ship had gone down.

00:11:30.540 --> 00:11:34.980 align:middle line:84%
On October 2, 1950, Klein was
questioned at the Army offices

00:11:34.980 --> 00:11:37.290 align:middle line:84%
in Denver, where
he denied having

00:11:37.290 --> 00:11:40.140 align:middle line:90%
any knowledge of the Aztec UFO.

00:11:40.140 --> 00:11:42.150 align:middle line:84%
Army personnel felt
that the man had

00:11:42.150 --> 00:11:44.940 align:middle line:84%
specific knowledge about
the Aztec incident,

00:11:44.940 --> 00:11:46.860 align:middle line:90%
but wouldn't admit it.

00:11:46.860 --> 00:11:49.050 align:middle line:10%
According to a
personality analysis,

00:11:49.050 --> 00:11:50.790 align:middle line:10%
Klein did not give
the impression

00:11:50.790 --> 00:11:54.990 align:middle line:10%
of being mentally unstable or
was one to attract attention.

00:11:54.990 --> 00:11:58.290 align:middle line:84%
Although he did admit that he
had drank alcohol at the time

00:11:58.290 --> 00:12:00.630 align:middle line:84%
he offered to buy
the photographs.

00:12:00.630 --> 00:12:04.050 align:middle line:84%
Klein claimed to be a reporter
for the Baltimore Sun.

00:12:04.050 --> 00:12:09.945 align:middle line:10%
The report is signed by Wallace
B. Scholes, district commander.

00:12:09.945 --> 00:12:12.878 align:middle line:84%
>> In a way, they are
recognizing that this really

00:12:12.878 --> 00:12:13.920 align:middle line:90%
happened and that's why--

00:12:13.920 --> 00:12:17.550 align:middle line:84%
>> Oh yeah, they're not denying
that the Aztec UFO incident

00:12:17.550 --> 00:12:19.240 align:middle line:90%
happened at all.

00:12:19.240 --> 00:12:22.190 align:middle line:84%
As a matter of fact,
they're reacting, saying,

00:12:22.190 --> 00:12:24.480 align:middle line:84%
"My god, if there's pictures
of it floating around,

00:12:24.480 --> 00:12:26.280 align:middle line:84%
we need to get the
pictures back."

00:12:26.280 --> 00:12:29.250 align:middle line:84%
We know from several
good witnesses

00:12:29.250 --> 00:12:32.130 align:middle line:84%
that black and white photos
were taken of the crash.

00:12:32.130 --> 00:12:34.470 align:middle line:84%
Frank Scully tells
it in his book.

00:12:34.470 --> 00:12:36.480 align:middle line:84%
And Frank Scully's
wife confirms it.

00:12:36.480 --> 00:12:40.323 align:middle line:84%
She held pictures of
the UFO crash landing,

00:12:40.323 --> 00:12:42.240 align:middle line:84%
whatever we want to call
it, that happened out

00:12:42.240 --> 00:12:43.320 align:middle line:90%
on Hart Canyon Road.

00:12:43.320 --> 00:12:44.670 align:middle line:90%
She held them in her hand.

00:12:44.670 --> 00:12:49.770 align:middle line:84%
Another researcher, who is now
deceased, backs that story up.

00:12:49.770 --> 00:12:52.590 align:middle line:84%
>> In another recently
declassified document from

00:12:52.590 --> 00:12:56.910 align:middle line:84%
October 16, 1950, the Army
closed the investigation

00:12:56.910 --> 00:13:01.480 align:middle line:84%
of the Aztec UFO photographs,
finding no evidence.

00:13:01.480 --> 00:13:02.940 align:middle line:84%
However, the
photographs, according

00:13:02.940 --> 00:13:07.780 align:middle line:84%
to the testimony of a few
people, claimed they did exist.

00:13:07.780 --> 00:13:10.950 align:middle line:84%
The Aztec case came under
public scrutiny thanks

00:13:10.950 --> 00:13:13.860 align:middle line:84%
to Frank Scully, an
investigative journalist,

00:13:13.860 --> 00:13:17.730 align:middle line:84%
who published the book, "Behind
the Flying Saucer" in September

00:13:17.730 --> 00:13:23.250 align:middle line:84%
1950, an overnight success that
sold more than 50,000 copies

00:13:23.250 --> 00:13:25.440 align:middle line:90%
in a few weeks.

00:13:25.440 --> 00:13:27.930 align:middle line:84%
The public was fascinated
with the story.

00:13:27.930 --> 00:13:30.540 align:middle line:10%
However, a smear campaign
would be carried out

00:13:30.540 --> 00:13:33.390 align:middle line:10%
after finding two of the
key players in the story

00:13:33.390 --> 00:13:35.280 align:middle line:10%
admitted they lied.

00:13:35.280 --> 00:13:38.610 align:middle line:10%
Silas Newton and Leo
Ge Bauer were legally

00:13:38.610 --> 00:13:43.560 align:middle line:10%
charged with committing fraud,
fraud that was never proven.

00:13:43.560 --> 00:13:46.980 align:middle line:84%
Unfortunately, it was too late
and the public lost interest

00:13:46.980 --> 00:13:50.790 align:middle line:84%
in the alien claims just as
had happened before in the case

00:13:50.790 --> 00:13:52.800 align:middle line:90%
of the Roswell crashes.

00:13:52.800 --> 00:13:56.310 align:middle line:84%
Today we know that both
cases are authentic.

00:13:56.310 --> 00:14:01.200 align:middle line:84%
Frank Fair, a journalism scholar
at New Mexico State University,

00:14:01.200 --> 00:14:02.525 align:middle line:90%
confirms this.

00:14:02.525 --> 00:14:03.900 align:middle line:84%
>> Frank Scully
was a journalist.

00:14:03.900 --> 00:14:06.090 align:middle line:84%
He was an entertainment
journalist.

00:14:06.090 --> 00:14:10.050 align:middle line:84%
And he wrote in a very
breezy, entertaining style.

00:14:10.050 --> 00:14:12.990 align:middle line:84%
But underneath, I began
to see that everything

00:14:12.990 --> 00:14:19.890 align:middle line:84%
in his book that seemed so
bizarre had a factual base.

00:14:19.890 --> 00:14:22.920 align:middle line:84%
And the more I
learned about him,

00:14:22.920 --> 00:14:26.820 align:middle line:84%
the more I felt that
we had something--

00:14:26.820 --> 00:14:30.310 align:middle line:84%
he had almost like a
puzzle in his book.

00:14:30.310 --> 00:14:31.840 align:middle line:10%
And you began to--

00:14:31.840 --> 00:14:33.810 align:middle line:10%
and I can turn to
any page in his book

00:14:33.810 --> 00:14:37.560 align:middle line:10%
and find something that
looks strange when we first

00:14:37.560 --> 00:14:40.560 align:middle line:10%
looked at it, turned out he
was telling the absolute truth

00:14:40.560 --> 00:14:41.970 align:middle line:10%
and he knew.

00:14:41.970 --> 00:14:44.130 align:middle line:84%
He had talked to
these scientists.

00:14:44.130 --> 00:14:47.070 align:middle line:84%
Silas Newton had introduced
him to scientists

00:14:47.070 --> 00:14:51.180 align:middle line:84%
who had probably pieces of
the craft, I don't know.

00:14:51.180 --> 00:14:57.300 align:middle line:84%
And Scully, to his dying day,
Scully said that this was true,

00:14:57.300 --> 00:14:59.640 align:middle line:90%
he never backed down from it.

00:14:59.640 --> 00:15:04.650 align:middle line:84%
And now Scott Ramsey has
proved him to be a prophet,

00:15:04.650 --> 00:15:06.930 align:middle line:90%
theoretically, you know?

00:15:06.930 --> 00:15:12.720 align:middle line:84%
In 1950, this book, Scully's
book sold 50,000 copies.

00:15:12.720 --> 00:15:16.440 align:middle line:84%
That should have ended the
secrecy about flying saucers.

00:15:16.440 --> 00:15:19.470 align:middle line:90%
But it was just beginning.

00:15:19.470 --> 00:15:21.330 align:middle line:90%
Somebody-- we don't know who--

00:15:21.330 --> 00:15:26.190 align:middle line:84%
some government agency
began to do a hatchet job

00:15:26.190 --> 00:15:30.660 align:middle line:84%
on Frank Scully and his
sources until he was

00:15:30.660 --> 00:15:33.560 align:middle line:90%
branded a hokester or a dupe.

00:15:33.560 --> 00:15:35.945 align:middle line:84%
Either he had hoaxed
the story or he

00:15:35.945 --> 00:15:40.905 align:middle line:84%
had been conned by Silas Newton
and his friend, Leo Ge Bauer.

00:15:40.905 --> 00:15:42.530 align:middle line:84%
And they said, there
were no such thing

00:15:42.530 --> 00:15:44.960 align:middle line:90%
as these nine scientists.

00:15:44.960 --> 00:15:49.580 align:middle line:84%
And now you read chapter
four of Scott Ramsey's book.

00:15:49.580 --> 00:15:51.560 align:middle line:84%
And you can see
all the scientists.

00:15:51.560 --> 00:15:55.220 align:middle line:84%
They all worked under Vannevar
Bush in the War Department.

00:15:55.220 --> 00:15:58.940 align:middle line:84%
They all were working
on magnetic anomalies.

00:15:58.940 --> 00:16:02.680 align:middle line:90%
And they all knew Silas Newton--

00:16:02.680 --> 00:16:04.730 align:middle line:90%
or most of them did.

00:16:04.730 --> 00:16:06.297 align:middle line:90%
And they talked to Frank Scully.

00:16:06.297 --> 00:16:08.130 align:middle line:84%
And they believed the
story should come out.

00:16:08.130 --> 00:16:11.540 align:middle line:84%
They believe the people
should get the story.

00:16:11.540 --> 00:16:14.960 align:middle line:84%
And then they realized that the
secrecy oaths they had taken

00:16:14.960 --> 00:16:17.630 align:middle line:84%
were very serious
and the penalties

00:16:17.630 --> 00:16:19.820 align:middle line:90%
very severe for revealing it.

00:16:19.820 --> 00:16:23.100 align:middle line:84%
So as Scully said, in 1949,
they would tell their stories

00:16:23.100 --> 00:16:23.900 align:middle line:90%
for free.

00:16:23.900 --> 00:16:27.230 align:middle line:84%
By 1950, they wouldn't tell
their stories for $20 million.

00:16:27.230 --> 00:16:32.700 align:middle line:90%
Scully was telling the truth.

00:16:32.700 --> 00:16:35.610 align:middle line:84%
>> We believe that Scully
was telling the truth,

00:16:35.610 --> 00:16:38.940 align:middle line:84%
a truth that is again
resurfacing more than 60 years

00:16:38.940 --> 00:16:39.910 align:middle line:90%
later.

00:16:39.910 --> 00:16:43.050 align:middle line:84%
The United States government
had undertaken a campaign

00:16:43.050 --> 00:16:46.650 align:middle line:84%
to discourage the authenticity
of Scully's story.

00:16:46.650 --> 00:16:51.450 align:middle line:84%
They wanted the case to
be literally forgotten.

00:16:51.450 --> 00:16:56.460 align:middle line:84%
>> We want to confirm that
this incident really happened,

00:16:56.460 --> 00:17:02.070 align:middle line:84%
that that 100-foot disk landed
on Hart Canyon Mesa and that

00:17:02.070 --> 00:17:06.210 align:middle line:84%
the military opened it up
and took away these bodies.

00:17:06.210 --> 00:17:08.579 align:middle line:90%
We can prove this happened.

00:17:08.579 --> 00:17:09.960 align:middle line:90%
We have the witnesses.

00:17:09.960 --> 00:17:12.990 align:middle line:84%
In a courtroom case, if you
have two witnesses who do not

00:17:12.990 --> 00:17:15.819 align:middle line:84%
know each other and they
tell the same story,

00:17:15.819 --> 00:17:17.490 align:middle line:84%
the jury is going
to have to say,

00:17:17.490 --> 00:17:19.869 align:middle line:90%
"They are telling the truth."

00:17:19.869 --> 00:17:23.520 align:middle line:84%
And I will say, certainly, Scott
Ramsey wants to tell the truth.

00:17:23.520 --> 00:17:26.700 align:middle line:84%
I've never seen him want
to change anything or make

00:17:26.700 --> 00:17:32.670 align:middle line:84%
it better or fill in something
with a fictional edition.

00:17:32.670 --> 00:17:35.550 align:middle line:84%
Everything in the book
is documented fact

00:17:35.550 --> 00:17:38.410 align:middle line:90%
as best he can do it.

00:17:38.410 --> 00:17:43.660 align:middle line:84%
>> Frank Scully was told
this story by scientists that

00:17:43.660 --> 00:17:47.620 align:middle line:84%
allegedly worked on the craft
after it was recovered out here

00:17:47.620 --> 00:17:48.640 align:middle line:90%
on Hart Canyon Road.

00:17:48.640 --> 00:17:51.740 align:middle line:90%


00:17:51.740 --> 00:17:54.260 align:middle line:10%
Throughout his book,
"Behind the Flying Saucers,"

00:17:54.260 --> 00:17:59.570 align:middle line:10%
that came out September
1950, he completely

00:17:59.570 --> 00:18:04.520 align:middle line:10%
goes through the whole scenario
with the scientists, what they

00:18:04.520 --> 00:18:06.890 align:middle line:10%
saw, what they experienced.

00:18:06.890 --> 00:18:09.710 align:middle line:84%
And he leaves you little
hints throughout the book book

00:18:09.710 --> 00:18:11.450 align:middle line:90%
on who these scientists were.

00:18:11.450 --> 00:18:13.850 align:middle line:90%
I've read that book 20 times.

00:18:13.850 --> 00:18:15.930 align:middle line:84%
And each time I
would reread it--

00:18:15.930 --> 00:18:18.890 align:middle line:84%
I have a copy that I've
marked all up with a Sharpie

00:18:18.890 --> 00:18:20.540 align:middle line:90%
highlighter.

00:18:20.540 --> 00:18:23.090 align:middle line:84%
And I go back and he'd be
talking about a scientist.

00:18:23.090 --> 00:18:25.990 align:middle line:84%
And I'd highlight certain
things he said about them.

00:18:25.990 --> 00:18:31.130 align:middle line:10%
And Suzanne and I spent hundreds
of hours looking at the eight

00:18:31.130 --> 00:18:33.740 align:middle line:10%
to nine scientists that
Scully claimed made up

00:18:33.740 --> 00:18:37.130 align:middle line:10%
the composite of Dr. Gee.

00:18:37.130 --> 00:18:39.290 align:middle line:84%
We've compared them
to all the scientists

00:18:39.290 --> 00:18:42.530 align:middle line:84%
that worked on the
Manhattan Project

00:18:42.530 --> 00:18:46.010 align:middle line:84%
or OSRD during World War II
where these guys allegedly

00:18:46.010 --> 00:18:50.180 align:middle line:84%
came from, peeling back layers
and layers of the onion,

00:18:50.180 --> 00:18:53.930 align:middle line:84%
comparing resumes, schooling,
what colleges, what

00:18:53.930 --> 00:18:57.140 align:middle line:84%
universities, what
degrees they had,

00:18:57.140 --> 00:19:00.030 align:middle line:84%
how many PhDs were
within the group.

00:19:00.030 --> 00:19:01.970 align:middle line:84%
And it took us years
until we came up

00:19:01.970 --> 00:19:06.140 align:middle line:84%
with what we figured
is a near-perfect list

00:19:06.140 --> 00:19:09.980 align:middle line:84%
of the scientists that we felt
talked to Frank Scully back

00:19:09.980 --> 00:19:13.720 align:middle line:90%
in 1949 for his book in 1950.

00:19:13.720 --> 00:19:15.630 align:middle line:90%
>> Who's Dr. Ge?

00:19:15.630 --> 00:19:19.730 align:middle line:84%
>> Dr. Gee, in our opinion,
the main Dr. Gee was Dr.

00:19:19.730 --> 00:19:26.550 align:middle line:84%
Jonathan Torrence Tate, who
was a fantastic physicist,

00:19:26.550 --> 00:19:29.600 align:middle line:84%
had gone to school at University
of Berlin in Germany prior

00:19:29.600 --> 00:19:34.130 align:middle line:84%
to the war breaking out,
finished his college

00:19:34.130 --> 00:19:38.210 align:middle line:84%
at Nebraska, went on
to get his doctorate.

00:19:38.210 --> 00:19:41.240 align:middle line:84%
We go into great detail
about him in our book.

00:19:41.240 --> 00:19:43.420 align:middle line:84%
And then the
peripheral scientist

00:19:43.420 --> 00:19:46.550 align:middle line:84%
that he actually would have
worked with during World War II

00:19:46.550 --> 00:19:50.790 align:middle line:84%
and after, he headed up
Division 6 of the OSRD.

00:19:50.790 --> 00:19:53.630 align:middle line:90%


00:19:53.630 --> 00:19:56.510 align:middle line:84%
The head of OSRD
was a name that's

00:19:56.510 --> 00:20:01.160 align:middle line:84%
very familiar to people
who studied UFOs and flying

00:20:01.160 --> 00:20:03.730 align:middle line:90%
saucers, Dr. Vannevar Bush.

00:20:03.730 --> 00:20:05.840 align:middle line:90%
That was the boss.

00:20:05.840 --> 00:20:09.330 align:middle line:84%
All of a sudden, pieces of
the puzzle started to fit.

00:20:09.330 --> 00:20:12.260 align:middle line:84%
Then we started looking at
schedules, travel schedules.

00:20:12.260 --> 00:20:14.360 align:middle line:90%
Where were these people in '49?

00:20:14.360 --> 00:20:16.340 align:middle line:90%
Where were they in '48?

00:20:16.340 --> 00:20:17.570 align:middle line:90%
Where were they traveling?

00:20:17.570 --> 00:20:20.780 align:middle line:10%
Frank Scully goes into detail
where he met some of them

00:20:20.780 --> 00:20:22.850 align:middle line:10%
in his travels.

00:20:22.850 --> 00:20:25.640 align:middle line:84%
If he doesn't go into
those details in his book,

00:20:25.640 --> 00:20:28.040 align:middle line:84%
he goes into those details
in his private letters

00:20:28.040 --> 00:20:31.400 align:middle line:84%
and memoirs, which
we've spent hundreds

00:20:31.400 --> 00:20:32.660 align:middle line:90%
of hours poring through.

00:20:32.660 --> 00:20:36.010 align:middle line:90%


00:20:36.010 --> 00:20:41.080 align:middle line:84%
It's just an amazing
puzzle that Scully left.

00:20:41.080 --> 00:20:44.610 align:middle line:84%
He left a paper trail
when it comes to Dr. Gee

00:20:44.610 --> 00:20:46.990 align:middle line:84%
that we were able
to put together.

00:20:46.990 --> 00:20:48.610 align:middle line:90%
>> I know that Frank Scully--

00:20:48.610 --> 00:20:50.230 align:middle line:84%
and I now believe
what he said-- he

00:20:50.230 --> 00:20:54.140 align:middle line:84%
said that there were eight
scientists in one place,

00:20:54.140 --> 00:20:55.330 align:middle line:90%
he said.

00:20:55.330 --> 00:20:57.280 align:middle line:90%
They all knew Silas Newton.

00:20:57.280 --> 00:21:00.010 align:middle line:84%
They knew him because Silas
Newton wanted to find oil.

00:21:00.010 --> 00:21:04.180 align:middle line:84%
And he wanted to use magnetic
anomaly detection devices

00:21:04.180 --> 00:21:06.610 align:middle line:90%
to find oil, which he did.

00:21:06.610 --> 00:21:09.400 align:middle line:10%
And these people had
created these devices

00:21:09.400 --> 00:21:12.580 align:middle line:10%
for finding submarines
during World War II.

00:21:12.580 --> 00:21:13.450 align:middle line:90%
And they did.

00:21:13.450 --> 00:21:15.520 align:middle line:84%
They sank submarines
because they

00:21:15.520 --> 00:21:17.110 align:middle line:84%
were able to find
them with something

00:21:17.110 --> 00:21:21.260 align:middle line:90%
beyond sonar and beyond radar.

00:21:21.260 --> 00:21:26.502 align:middle line:84%
And so I think that he knew,
and it was his opinion,

00:21:26.502 --> 00:21:28.210 align:middle line:84%
that the public should
find out about it.

00:21:28.210 --> 00:21:29.440 align:middle line:90%
The war was over.

00:21:29.440 --> 00:21:31.570 align:middle line:90%
We didn't need secrecy anymore.

00:21:31.570 --> 00:21:34.630 align:middle line:10%
And these scientists
met with Frank Scully.

00:21:34.630 --> 00:21:38.350 align:middle line:84%
Yet, he was smart enough
never to reveal their names.

00:21:38.350 --> 00:21:42.010 align:middle line:10%
He called them
collectively Dr. Gee.

00:21:42.010 --> 00:21:47.050 align:middle line:10%
And the main Dr. Gee,
as Scott has found out

00:21:47.050 --> 00:21:53.080 align:middle line:10%
through, oh, laborious research,
he's found out that Dr. Gee,

00:21:53.080 --> 00:21:59.330 align:middle line:10%
the main Dr. Gee was probably
Dr. Tate who died in 1950.

00:21:59.330 --> 00:22:00.280 align:middle line:90%
>> John Torrence Tate?

00:22:00.280 --> 00:22:01.900 align:middle line:90%
>> John Torrence Tate.

00:22:01.900 --> 00:22:03.980 align:middle line:90%
The place was packed.

00:22:03.980 --> 00:22:07.930 align:middle line:84%
And he said, "There is such
a thing as a flying saucer."

00:22:07.930 --> 00:22:10.950 align:middle line:84%
And he went on for
50 some odd minutes.

00:22:10.950 --> 00:22:13.690 align:middle line:84%
And then they rushed him
out of the auditorium.

00:22:13.690 --> 00:22:16.010 align:middle line:84%
And the Air Force
was hot on his heels.

00:22:16.010 --> 00:22:17.450 align:middle line:90%
They were trying to find him.

00:22:17.450 --> 00:22:19.090 align:middle line:90%
They didn't know where he was.

00:22:19.090 --> 00:22:23.410 align:middle line:84%
And the radio man
John Keeler Kohler

00:22:23.410 --> 00:22:26.040 align:middle line:90%
hid him and got him out of--

00:22:26.040 --> 00:22:28.300 align:middle line:84%
and it was a long time
before they figured out.

00:22:28.300 --> 00:22:31.330 align:middle line:84%
But Scully finally said
it was Silas Newton who

00:22:31.330 --> 00:22:33.180 align:middle line:90%
gave the lecture.

00:22:33.180 --> 00:22:36.500 align:middle line:84%
But from then on, Silas
Newton was a marked man.

00:22:36.500 --> 00:22:40.240 align:middle line:10%
And by 1952, they were starting
to build a case against him,

00:22:40.240 --> 00:22:44.200 align:middle line:10%
trying to find something
to prosecute him on,

00:22:44.200 --> 00:22:46.660 align:middle line:10%
not because they wanted
to prosecute him,

00:22:46.660 --> 00:22:51.160 align:middle line:10%
but because they wanted to
destroy the Aztec story.

00:22:51.160 --> 00:22:52.810 align:middle line:10%
And it worked.

00:22:52.810 --> 00:22:55.346 align:middle line:10%
It worked for another 50 years.

00:22:55.346 --> 00:22:58.610 align:middle line:10%

Newton, Leo Ge Bauer,

00:23:05.380 --> 00:23:09.470 align:middle line:10%
and Frank Scully were
persecuted and discredited.

00:23:09.470 --> 00:23:11.930 align:middle line:10%
The case was considered a fraud.

00:23:11.930 --> 00:23:15.140 align:middle line:10%
It took more than 60 years
for new investigators

00:23:15.140 --> 00:23:17.900 align:middle line:10%

and discover that truth

an authentic case

In that area, near the
Aztec in Farmington,

00:23:31.580 --> 00:23:34.070 align:middle line:10%
there were waves
of UFO sightings

00:23:34.070 --> 00:23:37.100 align:middle line:10%
shortly after the
Aztec case, showing

00:23:37.100 --> 00:23:42.020 align:middle line:10%

flying objects flew in
formation over Farmington,

>> I don't know.

00:26:01.080 --> 00:26:03.520 align:middle line:10%
There's been some that
speculate that maybe this

00:26:03.520 --> 00:26:08.080 align:middle line:10%
was close to two years to the
date of the Aztec incident

00:26:08.080 --> 00:26:13.030 align:middle line:10%
and maybe they were coming over
and show their comrades support

00:26:13.030 --> 00:26:15.910 align:middle line:10%
or maybe it was just
another sighting altogether.

But it's one that, even
for UFO researchers that

still find this one fascinating
and very well-documented.

00:26:29.160 --> 00:26:31.960 align:middle line:84%
>> Shortly before finishing
this investigation,

00:26:31.960 --> 00:26:34.710 align:middle line:84%
our crew witnessed
a strange sighting.

00:26:34.710 --> 00:26:37.260 align:middle line:84%
Shortly before 6 o'clock
in the afternoon,

00:26:37.260 --> 00:26:40.380 align:middle line:84%
they observed a very
bright object in the sky

00:26:40.380 --> 00:26:43.710 align:middle line:84%
over Farmington near
Aztec, New Mexico.

00:26:43.710 --> 00:26:46.290 align:middle line:90%
The UFO was extremely bright.

00:26:46.290 --> 00:26:48.810 align:middle line:84%
Unfortunately, they didn't
have a camera with them

00:26:48.810 --> 00:26:51.600 align:middle line:84%
and were concerned it
wouldn't be documented.

00:26:51.600 --> 00:26:54.190 align:middle line:84%
However, upon returning
to New Mexico,

00:26:54.190 --> 00:26:57.210 align:middle line:84%
they were able to obtain
this video from a witness who

00:26:57.210 --> 00:27:00.990 align:middle line:84%
recorded the object in Aztec
at exactly the same time

00:27:00.990 --> 00:27:03.900 align:middle line:84%
and day of the crew's
sighting, confirming

00:27:03.900 --> 00:27:07.950 align:middle line:84%
the presence of a bright
triangular object in the sky.

00:27:07.950 --> 00:27:09.290 align:middle line:90%
What do you think?

00:27:37.180 --> 00:27:40.900 align:middle line:10%
>> All the events presented in
this investigation are subject

00:27:40.900 --> 00:27:42.220 align:middle line:10%
to debate.

00:27:42.220 --> 00:27:46.780 align:middle line:10%
And several researchers
do not consider them real.

00:27:46.780 --> 00:27:49.630 align:middle line:10%
However, as it's
been demonstrated

00:27:49.630 --> 00:27:54.210 align:middle line:10%
throughout this investigation,
the evidence, the witnesses,

00:27:54.210 --> 00:27:58.520 align:middle line:10%
and the investigation of those
who have been directly involved

00:27:58.520 --> 00:28:01.750 align:middle line:10%
such as Paola Harris, in
the case of San Antonio, New

00:28:01.750 --> 00:28:06.430 align:middle line:10%
Mexico, Donald Schmitt and Tom
Carey in the case of Roswell,

00:28:06.430 --> 00:28:09.800 align:middle line:10%
and Scott and Suzanne
Ramsey in the case of Aztec

00:28:09.800 --> 00:28:15.010 align:middle line:10%
show that these events are real,
and that they happened exactly

00:28:15.010 --> 00:28:19.930 align:middle line:10%
as they are referred to in
Guy Hottel memo to Hoover.

Even though the FBI
continues to deny it,

00:28:22.830 --> 00:28:26.110 align:middle line:10%
today we know that
everything was true

00:28:26.110 --> 00:28:28.240 align:middle line:10%
and that the events happened.
