between 1945 and '48, at least

00:00:51.990 --> 00:00:55.900 align:middle line:10%
three UFO crash
around Los Alamos,

00:00:55.900 --> 00:00:58.920 align:middle line:10%
the first one in San
Antonio, Nuevo Mexico.

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:01.910 align:middle line:10%
Not too many people
know about this case.

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:05.940 align:middle line:84%
We are going to present all
the evidence, all the details

00:01:05.940 --> 00:01:09.990 align:middle line:84%
for the first time, and
probably its connection

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:13.401 align:middle line:90%
to Roswell, and also to Aztec.

00:01:13.401 --> 00:01:19.710 align:middle line:84%
Probably all these UFOs crash
because of the same reason.

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:23.700 align:middle line:90%
This is the full investigation.

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:27.360 align:middle line:10%
>> On March 22,
1950, Guy Hottel,

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:31.590 align:middle line:10%
the Field Investigator Director
of the FBI in Washington, DC,

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:36.030 align:middle line:10%
wrote a memo to J. Edgar
Hoover, Director of the FBI,

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:38.640 align:middle line:10%
quoting an Air Force
investigator that revealed

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:42.390 align:middle line:10%
to him that three unidentified
flying objects have been

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:44.090 align:middle line:10%
recovered in the
New Mexico area.

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:47.640 align:middle line:90%


00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:49.530 align:middle line:84%
According to the
information, the objects

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:52.650 align:middle line:84%
measured a little over
15 meters in diameter

00:01:52.650 --> 00:01:57.120 align:middle line:84%
and were occupied by beings less
than one meter tall, dressed

00:01:57.120 --> 00:02:02.080 align:middle line:84%
in silver suits, similar
to those of test pilots.

00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:03.910 align:middle line:84%
One of the most
important aspects

00:02:03.910 --> 00:02:06.640 align:middle line:84%
was that these ships had
fallen out of the sky

00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:08.830 align:middle line:84%
because powerful
radar systems used

00:02:08.830 --> 00:02:10.840 align:middle line:84%
by the government
of the United States

00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:13.720 align:middle line:84%
had interfered with
their navigation systems

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:17.050 align:middle line:90%
and had brought them down.

00:02:17.050 --> 00:02:19.300 align:middle line:84%
According to the
memorandum, this story

00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:21.760 align:middle line:84%
had not been officially
investigated yet.

00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:24.930 align:middle line:90%


00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:27.900 align:middle line:10%
Here we present to
you, word for word,

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:34.870 align:middle line:10%
agent Guy Hottel's memo to
FBI Director J. Edgar Hoover.

00:02:34.870 --> 00:02:37.840 align:middle line:10%
Office memorandum from the
United States government

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:44.500 align:middle line:10%
to the Director of the
FBI, March 22, 1950.

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:47.980 align:middle line:10%
Guy Hottel, Special
Investigative Agent,

00:02:47.980 --> 00:02:50.700 align:middle line:10%
Washington.

00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:53.430 align:middle line:84%
Here is that information
from Agent Hottel.

00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:57.230 align:middle line:90%


00:02:57.230 --> 00:03:00.860 align:middle line:10%
An Air Force investigator said
three of the so-called flying

00:03:00.860 --> 00:03:05.490 align:middle line:10%
saucers had been
recovered in New Mexico.

00:03:05.490 --> 00:03:09.080 align:middle line:10%
They were described as
circular, approximately 50 feet

00:03:09.080 --> 00:03:14.180 align:middle line:10%
in diameter, each occupied
by three alien bodies

00:03:14.180 --> 00:03:19.430 align:middle line:10%
with similar human attributes,
but only three feet tall,

00:03:19.430 --> 00:03:22.610 align:middle line:10%
dressed in metallic
clothes of fine texture.

00:03:22.610 --> 00:03:24.650 align:middle line:10%
Each body was covered
in a similar way

00:03:24.650 --> 00:03:26.645 align:middle line:10%
to the suits worn
by test pilots.

00:03:26.645 --> 00:03:29.360 align:middle line:90%


00:03:29.360 --> 00:03:31.370 align:middle line:10%
According to an
informant, the ships

00:03:31.370 --> 00:03:33.890 align:middle line:10%
were found in New
Mexico due to the fact

00:03:33.890 --> 00:03:36.260 align:middle line:10%
that the government
has a high power radar

00:03:36.260 --> 00:03:39.580 align:middle line:10%
operating in the area.

00:03:39.580 --> 00:03:42.520 align:middle line:84%
It is thought that the radar
interfered with the navigation

00:03:42.520 --> 00:03:45.430 align:middle line:90%
mechanisms of the ship.

00:03:45.430 --> 00:03:47.350 align:middle line:10%
The special agent
did not attempt

00:03:47.350 --> 00:03:51.920 align:middle line:10%
to conduct a more in-depth
assessment of this case.

00:03:51.920 --> 00:03:58.710 align:middle line:90%
Received on March 23, 1950.

00:03:58.710 --> 00:04:01.290 align:middle line:84%
This memo is the
most read document

00:04:01.290 --> 00:04:05.380 align:middle line:84%
in the declassified
files of the FBI.

00:04:05.380 --> 00:04:09.100 align:middle line:84%
Millions of people have
been captivated by it.

00:04:09.100 --> 00:04:13.600 align:middle line:84%
The FBI, however, considers that
it is an unconfirmed one page

00:04:13.600 --> 00:04:16.209 align:middle line:84%
report which was
never investigated.

00:04:16.209 --> 00:04:19.370 align:middle line:90%


00:04:19.370 --> 00:04:22.550 align:middle line:84%
According to the FBI,
Agent Hottel's memorandum

00:04:22.550 --> 00:04:25.910 align:middle line:84%
was released in his declassified
files at the end of the '70s.

00:04:25.910 --> 00:04:29.540 align:middle line:90%


00:04:29.540 --> 00:04:31.730 align:middle line:84%
Secondly, the
document was drafted

00:04:31.730 --> 00:04:36.110 align:middle line:84%
three years after the
supposed case of Roswell

00:04:36.110 --> 00:04:39.200 align:middle line:84%
and therefore it is considered
that both cases are not

00:04:39.200 --> 00:04:41.270 align:middle line:90%
connected.

00:04:41.270 --> 00:04:44.150 align:middle line:84%
Thirdly they claim
that the FBI does not

00:04:44.150 --> 00:04:48.440 align:middle line:84%
investigate UFO cases except
when they are officially

00:04:48.440 --> 00:04:51.060 align:middle line:90%
requested.

00:04:51.060 --> 00:04:55.770 align:middle line:84%
None of the arguments of
the FBI are convincing.

00:04:55.770 --> 00:04:58.320 align:middle line:10%
On the contrary, the
memo from Guy Hottel

00:04:58.320 --> 00:05:01.980 align:middle line:10%
reveals something that
was not known until now,

00:05:01.980 --> 00:05:04.050 align:middle line:10%
that there were
three ships recovered

00:05:04.050 --> 00:05:07.800 align:middle line:10%
in the vicinity of the nuclear
power plant of the Alamos

00:05:07.800 --> 00:05:10.050 align:middle line:10%
and that high
powered radars were

00:05:10.050 --> 00:05:13.370 align:middle line:10%
those responsible for the ships
having fallen from the sky.

00:05:13.370 --> 00:05:18.510 align:middle line:90%


00:05:18.510 --> 00:05:22.950 align:middle line:10%
>> Today we know that there is
evidence and testimonials that

00:05:22.950 --> 00:05:27.270 align:middle line:10%
show that three ships crash and
were recovered in the vicinity

00:05:27.270 --> 00:05:32.520 align:middle line:10%
of Los Alamos nuclear power
plant between 1945 and 1948.

00:05:32.520 --> 00:05:35.550 align:middle line:10%
The first one crash in
San Antonio, New Mexico

00:05:35.550 --> 00:05:38.310 align:middle line:10%
on August 16, 1945.

00:05:38.310 --> 00:05:42.900 align:middle line:10%
The second in Roswell, New
Mexico on July 3, 1947.

00:05:42.900 --> 00:05:50.650 align:middle line:10%
The third in Aztec, New
Mexico on March 25, 1948.

00:05:50.650 --> 00:05:53.710 align:middle line:84%
>> The author of this document
was also a man of great

00:05:53.710 --> 00:05:58.620 align:middle line:84%
confidence to FBI
Director J. Edgar Hoover.

00:05:58.620 --> 00:06:01.490 align:middle line:10%
He was the director of field
research of the Federal

00:06:01.490 --> 00:06:03.740 align:middle line:10%
Bureau of Investigation.

00:06:03.740 --> 00:06:07.940 align:middle line:10%
Guy Hottel, born in
1902 and graduated

00:06:07.940 --> 00:06:11.570 align:middle line:10%
from George Washington
University in Washington, DC.

00:06:11.570 --> 00:06:16.370 align:middle line:84%
He joined the FBI as
special agent in 1934.

00:06:16.370 --> 00:06:19.580 align:middle line:84%
In 1936, he was appointed
head of the field research

00:06:19.580 --> 00:06:26.390 align:middle line:84%
office, a position he held
until his retirement in 1955.

00:06:26.390 --> 00:06:29.420 align:middle line:90%
He died in 1990.

00:06:29.420 --> 00:06:32.210 align:middle line:84%
During his service as
Director of the FBI,

00:06:32.210 --> 00:06:34.280 align:middle line:84%
J. Edgar Hoover
knew that the Army

00:06:34.280 --> 00:06:36.860 align:middle line:84%
was in possession of
the unidentified flying

00:06:36.860 --> 00:06:42.020 align:middle line:84%
objects that crashed in
the New Mexico desert.

00:06:42.020 --> 00:06:45.320 align:middle line:84%
There is evidence to show
that the FBI was excluded

00:06:45.320 --> 00:06:48.200 align:middle line:84%
from conducting its
own investigation

00:06:48.200 --> 00:06:49.370 align:middle line:90%
into the recovered objects.

00:06:49.370 --> 00:06:52.140 align:middle line:90%


00:06:52.140 --> 00:06:54.590 align:middle line:10%
However, in a declassified
official document

00:06:54.590 --> 00:06:59.840 align:middle line:10%
known as Hoover's
Memorandum, Agent E.J. Fitch

00:06:59.840 --> 00:07:04.250 align:middle line:10%
informs agent D.M. Ladd
that the Army requested

00:07:04.250 --> 00:07:07.340 align:middle line:10%
the FBI to be involved
in the investigation

00:07:07.340 --> 00:07:11.950 align:middle line:10%
since the recovered objects
were not part of any experiment.

00:07:11.950 --> 00:07:14.590 align:middle line:10%
Clyde Tolson, the
deputy director,

00:07:14.590 --> 00:07:19.060 align:middle line:10%
wrote in his own handwriting,
I think we should do it,

00:07:19.060 --> 00:07:20.860 align:middle line:10%
while J. Edgar
Hoover, the Director,

00:07:20.860 --> 00:07:25.510 align:middle line:10%
also in his own handwriting,
but not very readable, says,

00:07:25.510 --> 00:07:27.530 align:middle line:10%
we should do it.

00:07:27.530 --> 00:07:30.490 align:middle line:84%
But before accepting,
we should insist

00:07:30.490 --> 00:07:34.090 align:middle line:84%
on having total access
to the recovered disks.

00:07:34.090 --> 00:07:38.420 align:middle line:10%
For example, Hoover writes,
in the case of the SA,

00:07:38.420 --> 00:07:43.480 align:middle line:10%
the Army appropriated the object
and did not let us examine it.

00:07:43.480 --> 00:07:45.980 align:middle line:90%
Some think that is reality.

00:07:45.980 --> 00:07:49.970 align:middle line:84%
It referred to an alleged
case in Shreveport, Louisiana.

00:07:49.970 --> 00:07:54.620 align:middle line:10%
However, that case was already
known to be a fraud in 1947.

00:07:54.620 --> 00:07:59.410 align:middle line:10%
It is more than evident that it
referred to a different case.

00:07:59.410 --> 00:08:01.390 align:middle line:10%
Today, thanks to
the investigations

00:08:01.390 --> 00:08:04.300 align:middle line:10%
carried out by
journalist Paola Harris,

00:08:04.300 --> 00:08:07.330 align:middle line:10%
we know that is the
case that occurred

00:08:07.330 --> 00:08:09.084 align:middle line:10%
in San Antonio, New Mexico.

00:08:09.084 --> 00:08:14.760 align:middle line:90%


00:08:14.760 --> 00:08:18.840 align:middle line:10%
>> On "Nuevo," we present the
investigation of extraordinary

00:08:18.840 --> 00:08:24.330 align:middle line:10%
cases that evidently are related
to the Los Alamos nuclear base,

00:08:24.330 --> 00:08:27.540 align:middle line:10%
the only place in the world
where nuclear weapons were

00:08:27.540 --> 00:08:33.870 align:middle line:10%
manufactured between
1945 and 1949.

00:08:33.870 --> 00:08:39.960 align:middle line:84%
>> On July 16, 1945, a bomb
of unknown proportions was

00:08:39.960 --> 00:08:45.540 align:middle line:84%
detonated only 15 kilometers
from San Antonio, New Mexico.

00:08:45.540 --> 00:08:48.840 align:middle line:84%
The place is known as
Trinity and gave its name

00:08:48.840 --> 00:08:50.820 align:middle line:84%
to the first nuclear
test conducted

00:08:50.820 --> 00:08:54.630 align:middle line:90%
in history, the Trinity test.

00:08:54.630 --> 00:08:58.270 align:middle line:84%
After more than five years
of secret operations,

00:08:58.270 --> 00:09:01.320 align:middle line:84%
the team, led by
Robert Oppenheimer,

00:09:01.320 --> 00:09:06.210 align:middle line:84%
was able to detonate a bomb
like no other whose destructive

00:09:06.210 --> 00:09:11.340 align:middle line:84%
power would forever change
the destiny of humanity.

00:09:11.340 --> 00:09:16.620 align:middle line:84%
On July 16, at 5 hours, 29
minutes, and 45 seconds,

00:09:16.620 --> 00:09:18.285 align:middle line:90%
history changed forever.

00:09:18.285 --> 00:09:24.240 align:middle line:90%


00:09:24.240 --> 00:09:28.080 align:middle line:84%
The so-called Manhattan Project
allowed the United States

00:09:28.080 --> 00:09:31.410 align:middle line:84%
to begin a new era
which, nevertheless,

00:09:31.410 --> 00:09:34.530 align:middle line:84%
has been constituted
as the greatest danger

00:09:34.530 --> 00:09:38.280 align:middle line:84%
that humanity has faced, a
danger that could one day

00:09:38.280 --> 00:09:41.130 align:middle line:90%
destroy life on planet Earth.

00:09:41.130 --> 00:09:44.850 align:middle line:84%
This experiment was so
secretive and dangerous

00:09:44.850 --> 00:09:48.390 align:middle line:84%
that the inhabitants of San
Antonio and Carrizozo, New

00:09:48.390 --> 00:09:51.630 align:middle line:84%
Mexico were never informed
of the danger they

00:09:51.630 --> 00:09:53.700 align:middle line:90%
faced that morning.

00:09:53.700 --> 00:09:55.190 align:middle line:90%
>> Were you there?

00:09:55.190 --> 00:10:03.000 align:middle line:84%
Were you here that day, July 16,
when the atomic bomb exploded?

00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:05.505 align:middle line:84%
>> It was early in the
morning there in Socorro,

00:10:05.505 --> 00:10:07.830 align:middle line:90%
that's about 10 miles.

00:10:07.830 --> 00:10:09.550 align:middle line:90%
I got up about that--

00:10:09.550 --> 00:10:10.350 align:middle line:90%
about that time.

00:10:10.350 --> 00:10:12.985 align:middle line:84%
At that time, they didn't
have an inside toilets and all

00:10:12.985 --> 00:10:16.500 align:middle line:90%
that stuff, so we--

00:10:16.500 --> 00:10:17.920 align:middle line:90%
I never did use the toilet.

00:10:17.920 --> 00:10:21.600 align:middle line:84%
I saw that flash
and then a boom.

00:10:21.600 --> 00:10:22.600 align:middle line:90%
I went to bed.

00:10:22.600 --> 00:10:25.050 align:middle line:84%
I didn't even tell
my folks about it.

00:10:25.050 --> 00:10:31.230 align:middle line:90%
Till my dad had a radio with--

00:10:31.230 --> 00:10:32.280 align:middle line:90%
a battery radio.

00:10:32.280 --> 00:10:34.890 align:middle line:90%
He had two batteries.

00:10:34.890 --> 00:10:38.890 align:middle line:84%
And one he would have for the
radio at night and the other

00:10:38.890 --> 00:10:42.990 align:middle line:84%
to put in the truck, you
know, before he'd go to work.

00:10:42.990 --> 00:10:49.490 align:middle line:84%
And we heard in the radio
that the ammunition dump

00:10:49.490 --> 00:10:52.400 align:middle line:90%
had exploded White Sands--

00:10:52.400 --> 00:10:55.020 align:middle line:90%


00:10:55.020 --> 00:10:55.820 align:middle line:90%
exploded.

00:10:55.820 --> 00:10:59.950 align:middle line:90%


00:10:59.950 --> 00:11:04.960 align:middle line:84%
But everybody figured
it was bigger.

00:11:04.960 --> 00:11:05.980 align:middle line:90%
>> Something bigger.

00:11:05.980 --> 00:11:08.210 align:middle line:90%
>> No.

00:11:08.210 --> 00:11:09.985 align:middle line:84%
But you know the
funny part about it

00:11:09.985 --> 00:11:12.580 align:middle line:84%
is they didn't let the
people know what they

00:11:12.580 --> 00:11:13.883 align:middle line:90%
were going to do, you know.

00:11:13.883 --> 00:11:15.550 align:middle line:84%
They didn't know if
that thing was going

00:11:15.550 --> 00:11:18.170 align:middle line:90%
to tear up the whole world or--

00:11:18.170 --> 00:11:20.700 align:middle line:90%


00:11:20.700 --> 00:11:23.830 align:middle line:90%
my mother-in-law was serious.

00:11:23.830 --> 00:11:26.911 align:middle line:84%
In fact, there's a picture of
her talking to some reporters

00:11:26.911 --> 00:11:27.711 align:middle line:90%
about--

00:11:27.711 --> 00:11:30.570 align:middle line:84%
I don't know where
the hell that--

00:11:30.570 --> 00:11:32.100 align:middle line:84%
>> Because they
didn't tell them?

00:11:32.100 --> 00:11:34.380 align:middle line:90%
>> They didn't tell anybody.

00:11:34.380 --> 00:11:39.300 align:middle line:84%
>> Two weeks later, that's
when they had the meeting over

00:11:39.300 --> 00:11:44.890 align:middle line:84%
at the Owl Bar company there,
telling the government,

00:11:44.890 --> 00:11:47.290 align:middle line:84%
telling all the people,
all the ranchers over here,

00:11:47.290 --> 00:11:52.630 align:middle line:84%
that it was a ammunition
dump that had blown up.

00:11:52.630 --> 00:11:56.250 align:middle line:90%


00:11:56.250 --> 00:11:59.060 align:middle line:90%
>> And they believed that?

00:11:59.060 --> 00:12:02.359 align:middle line:84%
>> We ranchers
were stupid enough.

00:12:02.359 --> 00:12:06.150 align:middle line:10%
We didn't know, you know?

00:12:06.150 --> 00:12:10.270 align:middle line:10%
But at the same
time, the animals,

00:12:10.270 --> 00:12:13.740 align:middle line:10%
their fur turned white
where it was black,

00:12:13.740 --> 00:12:17.100 align:middle line:10%
was a reflection of the light.

00:12:17.100 --> 00:12:20.990 align:middle line:84%
And that's why the government
just lied to the people.

00:12:20.990 --> 00:12:25.565 align:middle line:84%
And they kept it hush hush, and
no one done nothing about it.

00:12:25.565 --> 00:12:30.330 align:middle line:84%
And now it'll be fourth
or fifth generation

00:12:30.330 --> 00:12:32.771 align:middle line:90%
that are trying to bring out--

00:12:32.771 --> 00:12:36.430 align:middle line:84%
but there's no
one to fight with.

00:12:36.430 --> 00:12:40.710 align:middle line:84%
>> That morning, my mom
and I went over to the--

00:12:40.710 --> 00:12:43.740 align:middle line:84%
because [INAUDIBLE] we also
had a grocery store there.

00:12:43.740 --> 00:12:47.200 align:middle line:84%
And so we went over there to
get something that she needed

00:12:47.200 --> 00:12:49.020 align:middle line:90%
and such.

00:12:49.020 --> 00:12:53.106 align:middle line:84%
And there were soldiers
in front of the store.

00:12:53.106 --> 00:12:55.048 align:middle line:84%
And so they were
saying, oh, by the way,

00:12:55.048 --> 00:12:56.840 align:middle line:84%
you know that sound
you heard this morning?

00:12:56.840 --> 00:12:57.640 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:12:57.640 --> 00:12:59.370 align:middle line:84%
Well, some explosives,
you know, there

00:12:59.370 --> 00:13:02.590 align:middle line:84%
were some explosives in one
of the houses over there

00:13:02.590 --> 00:13:05.160 align:middle line:84%
in the places where
they store them

00:13:05.160 --> 00:13:07.800 align:middle line:84%
over at Alamogordo
that exploded,

00:13:07.800 --> 00:13:09.270 align:middle line:90%
and that's what you heard.

00:13:09.270 --> 00:13:12.140 align:middle line:90%
And that's what we believed.

00:13:12.140 --> 00:13:16.090 align:middle line:84%
>> Then you didn't even know
after the explosion what it

00:13:16.090 --> 00:13:16.890 align:middle line:90%
was.

00:13:16.890 --> 00:13:18.600 align:middle line:90%
>> We don't know what it was.

00:13:18.600 --> 00:13:23.310 align:middle line:84%
Until they dropped the bomb
on Hiroshima and Nagasaki

00:13:23.310 --> 00:13:25.770 align:middle line:84%
on August, I think it
was the 7th and the 9th.

00:13:25.770 --> 00:13:26.790 align:middle line:90%
>> The 6th and the 9th.

00:13:26.790 --> 00:13:28.360 align:middle line:90%
>> The 6th and the 9th.

00:13:28.360 --> 00:15:10.140 align:middle line:10%
>> [SPEAKING SPANISH]

00:15:10.140 --> 00:15:13.350 align:middle line:84%
>> According to historical
records regarding Trinity,

00:15:13.350 --> 00:15:16.320 align:middle line:84%
as well as the Los Alamos
nuclear power plant,

00:15:16.320 --> 00:15:19.860 align:middle line:84%
there were numerous reports of
the presence of strange objects

00:15:19.860 --> 00:15:22.170 align:middle line:90%
in the heavens, in the clouds.

00:15:22.170 --> 00:15:24.760 align:middle line:84%
At that time, people were just
not sure what was happening

00:15:24.760 --> 00:15:25.560 align:middle line:90%
or why.

00:15:25.560 --> 00:15:33.920 align:middle line:90%


00:15:33.920 --> 00:15:38.630 align:middle line:84%
On August 16, 1945, just 30
days after the detonation

00:15:38.630 --> 00:15:42.380 align:middle line:84%
of the first atomic bomb
in White Sands, New Mexico,

00:15:42.380 --> 00:15:46.190 align:middle line:84%
a few miles away, two
children, six and seven years

00:15:46.190 --> 00:15:50.720 align:middle line:84%
of age, respectively, Jose
Padilla and Reme Baca,

00:15:50.720 --> 00:15:55.580 align:middle line:84%
witnessed an
extraordinary event.

00:15:55.580 --> 00:15:57.360 align:middle line:10%
>> [SPEAKING SPANISH]

00:15:57.360 --> 00:17:18.810 align:middle line:90%


00:17:18.810 --> 00:17:23.130 align:middle line:84%
>> According to the testimony
of Reme Baca and Jose Padilla,

00:17:23.130 --> 00:17:26.670 align:middle line:84%
two children of Hispanic
origin who lived in the area,

00:17:26.670 --> 00:17:30.960 align:middle line:84%
claimed they observed an oval
object approximately 5 meters

00:17:30.960 --> 00:17:36.390 align:middle line:84%
high by 10 meters in diameter
crash into a brick tower 15

00:17:36.390 --> 00:17:39.210 align:middle line:84%
or 20 meters high with
an antenna on top of its

00:17:39.210 --> 00:17:40.710 align:middle line:90%
structure.

00:17:40.710 --> 00:17:45.060 align:middle line:84%
On impact, the tower
exploded and the foreign UFO

00:17:45.060 --> 00:17:48.840 align:middle line:84%
fell to the ground, skidding
across the sand and burning

00:17:48.840 --> 00:17:52.380 align:middle line:84%
vegetation for more
than 50 to 100 meters,

00:17:52.380 --> 00:17:56.160 align:middle line:84%
until it stopped on a sandbank
at the edge of a stream.

00:17:56.160 --> 00:17:56.980 align:middle line:90%
>> It landed there?

00:17:56.980 --> 00:17:57.780 align:middle line:90%
It crash?

00:17:57.780 --> 00:17:58.580 align:middle line:90%
What happened?

00:17:58.580 --> 00:18:01.713 align:middle line:90%


00:18:01.713 --> 00:18:03.630 align:middle line:84%
>> You can see the side
of the road over here,

00:18:03.630 --> 00:18:05.070 align:middle line:90%
on the hill over there.

00:18:05.070 --> 00:18:07.230 align:middle line:90%
Like a cut the old road.

00:18:07.230 --> 00:18:09.150 align:middle line:90%
That road wasn't there.

00:18:09.150 --> 00:18:14.850 align:middle line:84%
It came around like that and
hit the dirt right there,

00:18:14.850 --> 00:18:18.480 align:middle line:84%
and it made a big groove
all the way around,

00:18:18.480 --> 00:18:20.940 align:middle line:90%
like it was turning.

00:18:20.940 --> 00:18:22.110 align:middle line:90%
And it came down.

00:18:22.110 --> 00:18:27.730 align:middle line:84%
And this right here was like
a bunch of sand, an arroyo,

00:18:27.730 --> 00:18:29.040 align:middle line:90%
and a bunch of sand.

00:18:29.040 --> 00:18:32.890 align:middle line:84%
And he just buried
himself right in here.

00:18:32.890 --> 00:18:35.418 align:middle line:90%
And he stood up and this way.

00:18:35.418 --> 00:18:37.710 align:middle line:84%
That's where the hull-- you
can see the hull right here

00:18:37.710 --> 00:18:40.360 align:middle line:90%
on the side, on the top up here.

00:18:40.360 --> 00:18:43.820 align:middle line:90%
But this where he stopped.

00:18:43.820 --> 00:18:50.310 align:middle line:10%
And years and years
that it rains out here,

00:18:50.310 --> 00:18:54.330 align:middle line:10%
wheats come out,
except for here.

00:18:54.330 --> 00:18:55.620 align:middle line:90%
Nothing grows over here.

00:18:55.620 --> 00:18:58.210 align:middle line:90%


00:18:58.210 --> 00:18:59.010 align:middle line:90%
>> Where were you?

00:18:59.010 --> 00:19:01.990 align:middle line:90%


00:19:01.990 --> 00:19:04.020 align:middle line:90%
>> Up above here.

00:19:04.020 --> 00:19:06.600 align:middle line:90%
See the mesquite, mesquite.

00:19:06.600 --> 00:19:08.260 align:middle line:90%
See that right there?

00:19:08.260 --> 00:19:10.710 align:middle line:84%
The mesquite right
there, there were trees.

00:19:10.710 --> 00:19:12.900 align:middle line:84%
I mean, that's 70
years, you know.

00:19:12.900 --> 00:19:14.070 align:middle line:90%
There were trees.

00:19:14.070 --> 00:19:15.810 align:middle line:90%
We used to hide right there.

00:19:15.810 --> 00:19:18.288 align:middle line:90%
The horses were behind there.

00:19:18.288 --> 00:19:19.830 align:middle line:84%
And we used to hide
right there where

00:19:19.830 --> 00:19:26.160 align:middle line:84%
the military used to be working
over here on that object.

00:19:26.160 --> 00:19:28.640 align:middle line:84%
The trailer was loaded
right over here.

00:19:28.640 --> 00:19:29.730 align:middle line:90%
Where is it?

00:19:29.730 --> 00:19:34.620 align:middle line:84%
They picked it up from
there and loaded up on it.

00:19:34.620 --> 00:19:35.760 align:middle line:90%
>> You came every day.

00:19:35.760 --> 00:19:37.878 align:middle line:90%
>> Every day.

00:19:37.878 --> 00:19:39.670 align:middle line:84%
>> What do you remember
from the first day?

00:19:39.670 --> 00:19:42.960 align:middle line:84%
You came running, because
you saw the smoke.

00:19:42.960 --> 00:19:45.270 align:middle line:90%
>> We came running through here.

00:19:45.270 --> 00:19:49.890 align:middle line:84%
That little canyon right there,
we came out on the horses

00:19:49.890 --> 00:19:51.420 align:middle line:90%
through there.

00:19:51.420 --> 00:19:54.015 align:middle line:84%
When you see in that
thing smoking over here,

00:19:54.015 --> 00:19:58.060 align:middle line:84%
on the bottom over here, there
was a bunch of that chamiso--

00:19:58.060 --> 00:19:58.980 align:middle line:90%
you know chamiso?

00:19:58.980 --> 00:20:00.120 align:middle line:90%
Mesquite.

00:20:00.120 --> 00:20:04.440 align:middle line:84%
It was burning,
where it skidded,

00:20:04.440 --> 00:20:06.630 align:middle line:84%
metal, something
that you skidded.

00:20:06.630 --> 00:20:08.870 align:middle line:90%
It was burning, smoking.

00:20:08.870 --> 00:20:12.276 align:middle line:84%
When we came down over here, we
climbed that hill over and came

00:20:12.276 --> 00:20:14.820 align:middle line:90%
all the way to this side.

00:20:14.820 --> 00:20:16.950 align:middle line:84%
That's when we starting
seeing over here.

00:20:16.950 --> 00:20:18.780 align:middle line:90%
>> What did you see here?

00:20:18.780 --> 00:20:23.610 align:middle line:90%
>> That round UFO, you know.

00:20:23.610 --> 00:20:25.655 align:middle line:84%
>> And you saw the
creatures, too?

00:20:25.655 --> 00:20:26.490 align:middle line:90%
>> Pardon me?

00:20:26.490 --> 00:20:27.390 align:middle line:90%
>> The creatures.

00:20:27.390 --> 00:20:28.590 align:middle line:90%
>> The creatures were--

00:20:28.590 --> 00:20:32.370 align:middle line:84%
he was leaning up,
upright like that.

00:20:32.370 --> 00:20:36.510 align:middle line:84%
When he landed, he'd buried
part of it on the sand

00:20:36.510 --> 00:20:39.740 align:middle line:84%
and the hull was
right over here.

00:20:39.740 --> 00:20:42.810 align:middle line:84%
So how come we could
see from up above.

00:20:42.810 --> 00:20:45.990 align:middle line:84%
They were running, these
little four guys who

00:20:45.990 --> 00:20:47.410 align:middle line:90%
were running back and forth.

00:20:47.410 --> 00:20:48.970 align:middle line:90%
>> Who were they?

00:20:48.970 --> 00:20:49.922 align:middle line:90%
>> How were they?

00:20:49.922 --> 00:20:50.826 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:20:50.826 --> 00:20:53.990 align:middle line:90%


00:20:53.990 --> 00:20:57.870 align:middle line:10%
>> You know like a fire ant--

00:20:57.870 --> 00:20:59.420 align:middle line:10%
hormiga?

00:20:59.420 --> 00:21:01.720 align:middle line:90%
Like that, except that gray.

00:21:01.720 --> 00:21:08.150 align:middle line:84%
And they had long arms,
four fingers, no ears,

00:21:08.150 --> 00:21:11.720 align:middle line:84%
and the eyes were,
what, teardrop.

00:21:11.720 --> 00:21:14.620 align:middle line:90%


00:21:14.620 --> 00:21:19.390 align:middle line:84%
It looked like they
were naked, but it

00:21:19.390 --> 00:21:22.090 align:middle line:84%
looked like they
had like a uniform,

00:21:22.090 --> 00:21:27.550 align:middle line:84%
or I don't know what, it
was a smooth, you know?

00:21:27.550 --> 00:21:28.780 align:middle line:10%
But I noticed the arms.

00:21:28.780 --> 00:21:31.390 align:middle line:10%
There were longer than ours.

00:21:31.390 --> 00:21:35.350 align:middle line:10%
And I noticed that the
four fingers only, and--

00:21:35.350 --> 00:21:37.330 align:middle line:10%
>> Gray in color?

00:21:37.330 --> 00:21:38.980 align:middle line:10%
>> Grayish, yeah, grayish color.

00:21:38.980 --> 00:21:39.940 align:middle line:10%
>> Pinkish?

00:21:39.940 --> 00:21:40.740 align:middle line:90%
>> No.

00:21:40.740 --> 00:21:41.680 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:21:41.680 --> 00:21:45.070 align:middle line:84%
The ears were black, you know,
but long, like a football,

00:21:45.070 --> 00:21:46.480 align:middle line:90%
you know.

00:21:46.480 --> 00:21:48.310 align:middle line:10%
But no ears.

00:21:48.310 --> 00:21:51.520 align:middle line:90%
The mouth was a--

00:21:51.520 --> 00:21:53.110 align:middle line:90%
They remind me of a rabbit.

00:21:53.110 --> 00:21:56.550 align:middle line:84%
When we used to shoot the
rabbits, they'd cry, you know.

00:21:56.550 --> 00:21:58.510 align:middle line:10%
They remind me of
something like that.

00:21:58.510 --> 00:21:59.630 align:middle line:10%
>> They made noises?

00:21:59.630 --> 00:22:00.430 align:middle line:10%
>> Yeah.

00:22:00.430 --> 00:22:04.120 align:middle line:10%
Like a weird noise like
a baby crying, you know.

00:22:04.120 --> 00:22:06.810 align:middle line:10%
That's when I spotted
them from there, you know,

00:22:06.810 --> 00:22:09.580 align:middle line:10%
when I told Reme, let's--

00:22:09.580 --> 00:22:10.460 align:middle line:10%
they're hurt.

00:22:10.460 --> 00:22:11.650 align:middle line:10%
Let's go help them.

00:22:11.650 --> 00:22:14.690 align:middle line:10%
And Reme didn't want to.

00:22:14.690 --> 00:22:15.970 align:middle line:10%
>> He was scared?

00:22:15.970 --> 00:22:17.200 align:middle line:10%
>> He was scared.

00:22:17.200 --> 00:22:19.240 align:middle line:10%
As a matter of fact,
he started crying.

00:22:19.240 --> 00:22:22.620 align:middle line:10%
That's like, I went and got
on the horse and took off.

00:22:22.620 --> 00:22:24.310 align:middle line:10%
But who knows?

00:22:24.310 --> 00:22:28.360 align:middle line:10%
If I would have come
over here, maybe I

00:22:28.360 --> 00:22:31.750 align:middle line:10%
wouldn't be here telling
you this, you know.

00:22:31.750 --> 00:22:33.610 align:middle line:10%
Maybe I would have
been somewhere else.

00:22:33.610 --> 00:22:38.920 align:middle line:10%
Because the following day,
two days that came after that,

00:22:38.920 --> 00:22:40.370 align:middle line:10%
there weren't here.

00:22:40.370 --> 00:22:43.120 align:middle line:84%
But all the debris
that was out here

00:22:43.120 --> 00:22:47.200 align:middle line:84%
was cleaned up,
like with a rake.

00:22:47.200 --> 00:22:48.640 align:middle line:90%
>> Who did that?

00:22:48.640 --> 00:22:49.440 align:middle line:90%
>> Who knows?

00:22:49.440 --> 00:22:50.710 align:middle line:90%
>> The military?

00:22:50.710 --> 00:22:51.520 align:middle line:90%
>> No, no, no.

00:22:51.520 --> 00:22:54.190 align:middle line:84%
The military didn't appear
over here until the fourth day.

00:22:54.190 --> 00:22:56.710 align:middle line:90%


00:22:56.710 --> 00:22:59.372 align:middle line:84%
>> It means that
they received help.

00:22:59.372 --> 00:23:01.580 align:middle line:10%
>> And they might have had
scouts up there, you know,

00:23:01.580 --> 00:23:04.150 align:middle line:10%
that came over and took them.

00:23:04.150 --> 00:23:05.970 align:middle line:84%
That's how come we
never did find out,

00:23:05.970 --> 00:23:08.012 align:middle line:84%
state police and
my father, that's

00:23:08.012 --> 00:23:09.220 align:middle line:90%
how come we didn't find them.

00:23:09.220 --> 00:23:11.950 align:middle line:90%


00:23:11.950 --> 00:23:15.190 align:middle line:84%
>> You remember, this was
August 16, that is correct?

00:23:15.190 --> 00:23:16.630 align:middle line:90%
>> August 16th.

00:23:16.630 --> 00:23:18.910 align:middle line:90%
>> And you didn't come next day?

00:23:18.910 --> 00:23:19.910 align:middle line:90%
>> No, no.

00:23:19.910 --> 00:23:21.493 align:middle line:84%
>> On August 17, you
didn't come here.

00:23:21.493 --> 00:23:22.293 align:middle line:90%
>> No.

00:23:22.293 --> 00:23:24.062 align:middle line:84%
On the 18th is
when we came here.

00:23:24.062 --> 00:23:25.270 align:middle line:90%
>> And there was nobody here.

00:23:25.270 --> 00:23:27.220 align:middle line:90%
>> There was just a cleared up.

00:23:27.220 --> 00:23:30.960 align:middle line:84%
When we came out,
that state police

00:23:30.960 --> 00:23:33.100 align:middle line:90%
parked their car up above.

00:23:33.100 --> 00:23:35.370 align:middle line:90%
And they walked.

00:23:35.370 --> 00:23:37.790 align:middle line:90%
And we walked right behind them.

00:23:37.790 --> 00:23:40.750 align:middle line:90%
And we couldn't see right here.

00:23:40.750 --> 00:23:43.960 align:middle line:84%
It looked like they had threw
dirt on top of it or something.

00:23:43.960 --> 00:23:45.940 align:middle line:90%
So someone was here before.

00:23:45.940 --> 00:23:46.930 align:middle line:90%
Not the military.

00:23:46.930 --> 00:23:48.530 align:middle line:90%
>> And tried to hide the craft?

00:23:48.530 --> 00:23:50.440 align:middle line:90%
>> It's possible, yeah.

00:23:50.440 --> 00:23:51.860 align:middle line:90%
>> It had dirt on it?

00:23:51.860 --> 00:23:54.270 align:middle line:84%
>> Just dirt, degree, and
everything else, you know.

00:23:54.270 --> 00:23:57.550 align:middle line:84%
But the rest of it
was just cleaned up.

00:23:57.550 --> 00:24:03.760 align:middle line:10%
Afterwards, when the military
came over here and started

00:24:03.760 --> 00:24:08.770 align:middle line:10%
building that L-frame
to load that object on,

00:24:08.770 --> 00:24:24.130 align:middle line:10%
then that is when they started
pushing the gap, the arroyo,

00:24:24.130 --> 00:24:27.820 align:middle line:10%
[SPANISH] or whatever, was
on that side over there.

00:24:27.820 --> 00:24:32.110 align:middle line:84%
From here, the soldiers start
pushing junk in there, metal,

00:24:32.110 --> 00:24:35.960 align:middle line:90%
whatever, started pushing it.

00:24:35.960 --> 00:24:37.960 align:middle line:90%
>> That is still there?

00:24:37.960 --> 00:24:49.370 align:middle line:84%
>> We're about 20 feet
high over here of dirt.

00:24:49.370 --> 00:24:50.170 align:middle line:90%
Who knows?

00:24:50.170 --> 00:24:51.220 align:middle line:90%
It might be there.

00:24:51.220 --> 00:24:54.430 align:middle line:84%
My cousin came over
with a bulldozer

00:24:54.430 --> 00:24:57.670 align:middle line:84%
and pushed some of that dirt
and build this right here.

00:24:57.670 --> 00:24:58.470 align:middle line:90%
That wasn't there.

00:24:58.470 --> 00:25:02.200 align:middle line:90%


00:25:02.200 --> 00:25:03.670 align:middle line:84%
He pushed this out
here, you know,

00:25:03.670 --> 00:25:06.280 align:middle line:84%
so that we can get some
water for the cows over here.

00:25:06.280 --> 00:25:08.950 align:middle line:90%


00:25:08.950 --> 00:25:13.690 align:middle line:84%
Afterwards, the rains came,
push all that hump right there.

00:25:13.690 --> 00:25:16.300 align:middle line:84%
It's possible they push
some of the dirt up there

00:25:16.300 --> 00:25:18.560 align:middle line:84%
and some of that material
that fell on the other side.

00:25:18.560 --> 00:25:22.390 align:middle line:90%


00:25:22.390 --> 00:25:25.330 align:middle line:84%
>> It is possible that you
can still find small remains

00:25:25.330 --> 00:25:27.280 align:middle line:90%
of the ship that crashed there.

00:25:27.280 --> 00:25:29.530 align:middle line:84%
An earlier archaeological
investigation

00:25:29.530 --> 00:25:32.650 align:middle line:84%
found pieces of the craft,
or unidentified ship,

00:25:32.650 --> 00:25:34.285 align:middle line:90%
that apparently fell from space.

00:25:34.285 --> 00:25:38.647 align:middle line:90%


00:25:38.647 --> 00:25:41.320 align:middle line:90%
>> Who knows what happened here?

00:25:41.320 --> 00:25:46.180 align:middle line:84%
Just me and you, and Paul,
and these other girls.

00:25:46.180 --> 00:25:46.980 align:middle line:90%
>> Nobody else.

00:25:46.980 --> 00:25:47.780 align:middle line:90%
>> Nobody else.

00:25:47.780 --> 00:25:51.250 align:middle line:90%


00:25:51.250 --> 00:25:57.360 align:middle line:84%
They know and they heard that
something had happened here.

00:25:57.360 --> 00:26:00.900 align:middle line:84%
But let me tell
you something else,

00:26:00.900 --> 00:26:04.860 align:middle line:84%
people from New
York, scientists,

00:26:04.860 --> 00:26:10.810 align:middle line:84%
had come over here trying to
find where the wreckage was.

00:26:10.810 --> 00:26:13.500 align:middle line:90%
And they went right by here.

00:26:13.500 --> 00:26:16.020 align:middle line:84%
They didn't know what
the heck's going on.

00:26:16.020 --> 00:26:18.050 align:middle line:84%
They wind up over
in the [SPANISH]..

00:26:18.050 --> 00:26:21.920 align:middle line:90%


00:26:21.920 --> 00:26:24.140 align:middle line:90%
Yet they put it in the paper.

00:26:24.140 --> 00:26:25.550 align:middle line:90%
It's not true.

00:26:25.550 --> 00:26:28.190 align:middle line:84%
Why the military
bury metal here?

00:26:28.190 --> 00:26:30.680 align:middle line:90%
Why they didn't take it?

00:26:30.680 --> 00:26:37.160 align:middle line:84%
>> Because they had a group of
seven men that they sent over

00:26:37.160 --> 00:26:38.300 align:middle line:90%
here.

00:26:38.300 --> 00:26:44.420 align:middle line:84%
That my opinion is that they
were too lazy to do their job.

00:26:44.420 --> 00:26:45.830 align:middle line:90%
They used to come over here.

00:26:45.830 --> 00:26:50.180 align:middle line:84%
One man used to sit on
post over here to watch.

00:26:50.180 --> 00:26:55.010 align:middle line:84%
And the six men used to start
digging, cleaning up the stuff.

00:26:55.010 --> 00:26:59.690 align:middle line:84%
Part of it they were
digging it and burying it.

00:26:59.690 --> 00:27:01.160 align:middle line:84%
They were waiting
for the evening

00:27:01.160 --> 00:27:06.000 align:middle line:84%
to come to go to the Owl
Bar to see their girls.

00:27:06.000 --> 00:27:09.590 align:middle line:90%
That's what my opinion was.

00:27:09.590 --> 00:27:10.510 align:middle line:90%
>> They were careless.

00:27:10.510 --> 00:27:11.310 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:27:11.310 --> 00:27:12.110 align:middle line:90%
They were careless.

00:27:12.110 --> 00:27:14.840 align:middle line:84%
They were not doing their
job the way they should.

00:27:14.840 --> 00:27:20.750 align:middle line:84%
And I say that I would blame the
man that was posted out here.

00:27:20.750 --> 00:27:22.560 align:middle line:90%
He was the one in command.

00:27:22.560 --> 00:27:25.425 align:middle line:90%
He didn't do his job right.

00:27:25.425 --> 00:27:27.050 align:middle line:84%
He didn't do his job
right because they

00:27:27.050 --> 00:27:28.070 align:middle line:90%
stole a part from it.

00:27:28.070 --> 00:27:32.260 align:middle line:90%


00:27:32.260 --> 00:27:33.972 align:middle line:90%
Someone took it.

00:27:33.972 --> 00:27:34.904 align:middle line:90%
>> Someone took it.

00:27:34.904 --> 00:27:37.450 align:middle line:90%
And you were a little kid.

00:27:37.450 --> 00:27:38.670 align:middle line:90%
And you were a little kid.

00:27:38.670 --> 00:27:40.790 align:middle line:90%
>> Except for the last day.

00:27:40.790 --> 00:27:44.060 align:middle line:84%
The last day that they came over
and they loaded up everything

00:27:44.060 --> 00:27:48.290 align:middle line:84%
up here, put the tarp on it, the
ropes, we were hiding up there,

00:27:48.290 --> 00:27:50.420 align:middle line:90%
looking at them.

00:27:50.420 --> 00:27:52.730 align:middle line:84%
They all, seven of
them, they all got

00:27:52.730 --> 00:27:56.480 align:middle line:84%
in the Jeep in the
evening and took off to go

00:27:56.480 --> 00:27:58.320 align:middle line:90%
see the girls in the Owl Bar.

00:27:58.320 --> 00:28:00.330 align:middle line:90%
>> And that's up there.

00:28:00.330 --> 00:28:03.080 align:middle line:84%
>> That's where we
decided to come down here.

00:28:03.080 --> 00:28:06.440 align:middle line:10%
There was no one over here.

00:28:06.440 --> 00:28:09.440 align:middle line:84%
>> The craft was in
the trailer already.

00:28:09.440 --> 00:28:13.620 align:middle line:84%
>> It was on the trailer, with
a tarp on top and the ropes tied

00:28:13.620 --> 00:28:14.420 align:middle line:90%
down.

00:28:14.420 --> 00:28:15.880 align:middle line:90%
>> And was alone here.

00:28:15.880 --> 00:28:17.370 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, myself, yeah.

00:28:17.370 --> 00:28:21.160 align:middle line:84%
There's no one-- took off
on the Jeep and took off.

00:28:21.160 --> 00:28:25.050 align:middle line:84%
I don't know what
time they came back.

00:28:25.050 --> 00:28:30.500 align:middle line:84%
But that object was moved
that night around 12:00.

00:28:30.500 --> 00:28:34.480 align:middle line:84%
Because at 12:00 clock,
San Antonio is asleep.

00:28:34.480 --> 00:28:38.870 align:middle line:90%


00:28:38.870 --> 00:28:40.830 align:middle line:84%
Because the following
day, we came out here

00:28:40.830 --> 00:28:42.400 align:middle line:90%
and it wasn't here.

00:28:42.400 --> 00:28:45.800 align:middle line:84%
But we had seen
it the day before.

00:28:45.800 --> 00:28:47.880 align:middle line:84%
>> Then they did it in
