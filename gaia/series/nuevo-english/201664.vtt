and 4:00 in the morning,

00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:50.010 align:middle line:10%
a tetrahedron of the same
dimensions appeared again,

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:58.160 align:middle line:10%
but now over the Pentagon

00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:02.330 align:middle line:10%
the case that occurred
on December 19,

00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:06.740 align:middle line:10%
2018 is very similar to the
one that happened between 5:00

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:10.250 align:middle line:10%
and 8:00 in the morning
in December 2009.

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:12.710 align:middle line:10%
This was presented,
again, on another

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:15.260 align:middle line:10%
of the most restricted
and safe places

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:17.480 align:middle line:10%
in the world, the Pentagon.

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:20.870 align:middle line:10%
That morning, at least four
people observed and video

00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:25.610 align:middle line:10%
recorded a similar object,
a tetrahedron between 100

00:01:25.610 --> 00:01:29.660 align:middle line:10%
and 200 meters in size,
according to witnesses.

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:33.020 align:middle line:84%
It was larger than an
airplane, perhaps up

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:36.560 align:middle line:84%
to twice the size of the
largest of today's aircrafts.

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:41.870 align:middle line:90%


00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:44.540 align:middle line:90%
The similarities are surprising.

00:01:44.540 --> 00:01:49.740 align:middle line:84%
In both cases, it was spaces
restricted to navigation.

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:52.380 align:middle line:84%
Any aircraft that had
approached the facilities

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:57.240 align:middle line:84%
would have been attacked,
and very possibly shot down.

00:01:57.240 --> 00:02:00.600 align:middle line:10%
In both cases, it happened
during the first hours

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:03.030 align:middle line:10%
of the day in the
month of December.

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:05.820 align:middle line:10%
In both cases, the
images were captured

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:09.840 align:middle line:10%
with photographic cameras,
except for one of the videos.

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:12.090 align:middle line:10%
In both cases, one
of the recordings

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:15.330 align:middle line:10%
was made from a moving car
with young people returning

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:20.130 align:middle line:10%
from a party, and who casually
brought a camera that they

00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:23.910 align:middle line:10%
had to use before
at a social event.

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:28.350 align:middle line:10%
In both cases, the governments
decided to remain silent.

00:02:28.350 --> 00:02:31.440 align:middle line:10%
In the United States,
unlike Russia, the media

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:36.640 align:middle line:10%
did not present the information
or conduct an investigation.

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:38.830 align:middle line:10%
In neither case has
anyone attempted

00:02:38.830 --> 00:02:42.540 align:middle line:10%
to demonstrate the
possibility of a joke.

00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:46.800 align:middle line:10%
In both cases, the object
was dark, almost invisible

00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:47.820 align:middle line:10%
to the eye.

00:02:47.820 --> 00:02:49.980 align:middle line:10%
And even as it had
been pointed out,

00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:52.740 align:middle line:10%
it was not possible to
record it with cell phones,

00:02:52.740 --> 00:02:56.580 align:middle line:10%
because it was very
difficult to see.

00:02:56.580 --> 00:02:59.940 align:middle line:10%
It was practically
mimicking the sky.

00:02:59.940 --> 00:03:03.860 align:middle line:10%
In both cases, the
weather was very cold.

00:03:03.860 --> 00:03:07.220 align:middle line:10%
There were practically
no people on the streets.

00:03:07.220 --> 00:03:11.000 align:middle line:10%
The implications in both
the United States and Russia

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:12.950 align:middle line:10%
are extraordinary.

00:03:21.910 --> 00:03:25.660 align:middle line:84%
It's hard to believe,
but the cases are true,

00:03:25.660 --> 00:03:28.900 align:middle line:84%
and this research, all the
evidence, and all the people

00:03:28.900 --> 00:03:32.190 align:middle line:84%
who could record the images
of a tetrahedron over 100

00:03:32.190 --> 00:03:40.420 align:middle line:84%
meters in diameter will be
presented as the images show.

involved in this case

00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:46.720 align:middle line:84%
requested to be recognized
only by their first name,

00:03:46.720 --> 00:03:50.740 align:middle line:84%
because they do not wish
to be publicly identified.

00:03:50.740 --> 00:03:54.250 align:middle line:84%
Nuevo has fully
investigated the witnesses

00:03:54.250 --> 00:03:57.100 align:middle line:84%
and has corroborated
information and verified

00:03:57.100 --> 00:04:02.750 align:middle line:84%
their identity, which it would
make public only if necessary.

they observed the giant object.

00:04:24.450 --> 00:04:26.820 align:middle line:84%
He tried to record it
with his cell phone,

00:04:26.820 --> 00:04:29.580 align:middle line:84%
and as in other cases,
the picture definition

00:04:29.580 --> 00:04:32.700 align:middle line:90%
was not clear enough.

00:04:32.700 --> 00:04:34.770 align:middle line:84%
Luckily, he had a
camera with which

00:04:34.770 --> 00:04:36.120 align:middle line:90%

National Airport, located very

00:06:47.400 --> 00:06:50.760 align:middle line:90%
close to the Potomac River.

00:07:05.940 --> 00:07:10.050 align:middle line:84%

of the lights from the city.

should not walk around.

Well, OK.

00:07:35.370 --> 00:07:39.330 align:middle line:84%
I am living in Washington
now for a long time.

00:07:39.330 --> 00:07:42.750 align:middle line:84%
And my profession
in Czechoslovakia

00:07:42.750 --> 00:07:44.990 align:middle line:90%
was a photographer.

00:07:44.990 --> 00:07:47.140 align:middle line:90%
In Washington, it's not.

00:07:47.140 --> 00:07:48.980 align:middle line:90%
I am just studying for docs.

00:07:48.980 --> 00:07:51.350 align:middle line:84%
But I love to make
photographies,

00:07:51.350 --> 00:07:56.860 align:middle line:84%
and I have a little
project I have

00:07:56.860 --> 00:08:02.980 align:middle line:84%
to make at Arlington
cemetery during dark times.

00:08:02.980 --> 00:08:06.660 align:middle line:84%
Well, it's not allowed to
stay at Arlington Cemetery

00:08:06.660 --> 00:08:08.950 align:middle line:90%
at the dark time of day.

00:08:08.950 --> 00:08:14.990 align:middle line:84%
So me and my wife
got hidden there,

00:08:14.990 --> 00:08:18.750 align:middle line:90%
and we were shooting my project.

00:08:18.750 --> 00:08:20.460 align:middle line:10%
And then I definitely--

00:08:20.460 --> 00:08:27.440 align:middle line:10%
I saw something hovering
over the Pentagon, far away.

00:08:27.440 --> 00:08:29.840 align:middle line:10%
I didn't understand
what is this.

00:08:29.840 --> 00:08:34.820 align:middle line:90%
It was a black, big object.

00:08:34.820 --> 00:08:40.230 align:middle line:10%
I tried to film it with my
iPhone, but it didn't see it.

00:08:40.230 --> 00:08:43.730 align:middle line:10%
It was just pitch black skies.

00:08:43.730 --> 00:08:50.810 align:middle line:10%
But with my camera, Nikon,
I could make some shots.

00:08:50.810 --> 00:08:52.610 align:middle line:90%
And so it is this story.

00:08:52.610 --> 00:08:55.250 align:middle line:84%
But my wife became
really scared.

00:08:55.250 --> 00:08:58.070 align:middle line:10%
She asked me, come on, go away.

00:08:58.070 --> 00:08:59.890 align:middle line:10%
We should not be here.

00:08:59.890 --> 00:09:03.610 align:middle line:10%
Well, well, basically,
I was afraid to,

00:09:03.610 --> 00:09:05.890 align:middle line:10%
because I didn't
know what is this.

00:09:05.890 --> 00:09:07.700 align:middle line:84%
>> Were you
surprised about this,

00:09:07.700 --> 00:09:13.020 align:middle line:84%
a huge pyramid hovering
over the Pentagon?

00:09:13.020 --> 00:09:14.000 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, yes.

00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:15.460 align:middle line:90%
Of course, I was surprised.

00:09:15.460 --> 00:09:18.760 align:middle line:84%
And then I was afraid because
you know, this is Pentagon,

00:09:18.760 --> 00:09:19.990 align:middle line:90%
the military.

00:09:19.990 --> 00:09:24.280 align:middle line:84%
And I thought, and this is
what I am thinking still,

00:09:24.280 --> 00:09:28.000 align:middle line:84%
I thought that this is some
secret weapon they are testing,

00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:30.460 align:middle line:90%
and I should not be seeing it.

00:09:30.460 --> 00:09:33.960 align:middle line:90%
So that is why I was afraid.

00:09:33.960 --> 00:09:35.700 align:middle line:90%
This is Pentagon.

00:09:35.700 --> 00:09:38.160 align:middle line:84%

00:09:42.600 --> 00:09:44.970 align:middle line:90%

the Kremlin, but now I know.

00:09:53.510 --> 00:09:56.280 align:middle line:84%

told me about that.

00:09:56.280 --> 00:09:57.800 align:middle line:90%

00:09:57.800 --> 00:10:00.175 align:middle line:90%

00:10:14.270 --> 00:10:18.290 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, I don't know, but
if it's hovering over big

00:10:18.290 --> 00:10:22.660 align:middle line:84%
government buildings
in Russia and America,

00:10:22.660 --> 00:10:26.120 align:middle line:84%
I think it means that
it's something connected.

00:10:26.120 --> 00:10:28.080 align:middle line:84%
The governments,
they know about it.

00:10:28.080 --> 00:10:32.240 align:middle line:84%
It should be some sort
of aircraft, I think.

00:10:32.240 --> 00:10:35.480 align:middle line:84%
I don't believe it
was [INAUDIBLE]..

00:10:35.480 --> 00:10:38.433 align:middle line:84%
>> Do you know if
many people saw it?

00:10:38.433 --> 00:10:40.280 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:10:40.280 --> 00:10:42.480 align:middle line:90%
>> Many people saw it.

00:10:42.480 --> 00:10:43.280 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes, I know.

00:10:43.280 --> 00:10:46.730 align:middle line:84%
Many-- I have seen
another two videos

00:10:46.730 --> 00:10:48.590 align:middle line:84%
of that pyramid
over the Pentagon,

00:10:48.590 --> 00:10:52.520 align:middle line:84%
so I suppose a lot of people saw
it but they could not film it,

00:10:52.520 --> 00:10:58.400 align:middle line:84%
because it's impossible
with a simple iPhone, phone.

00:10:58.400 --> 00:11:02.890 align:middle line:90%
You need a good camera.

00:11:02.890 --> 00:11:06.130 align:middle line:90%
I couldn't film it on my iPhone.

00:11:06.130 --> 00:11:09.800 align:middle line:84%
>> It was very fortunate
you had another camera.

00:11:09.800 --> 00:11:10.600 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes, yes.

00:11:10.600 --> 00:11:13.190 align:middle line:84%
I was there was my
camera for my project.

00:11:13.190 --> 00:11:15.000 align:middle line:10%
So--

00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:18.540 align:middle line:10%
>> Without a doubt, one of the
reasons why an event like this

00:11:18.540 --> 00:11:22.830 align:middle line:10%
did not cause panic was because
a great tetrahedron blending

00:11:22.830 --> 00:11:25.950 align:middle line:10%
into the sky was
difficult to perceive,

00:11:25.950 --> 00:11:28.150 align:middle line:10%
even with the naked eye.

00:11:28.150 --> 00:11:30.900 align:middle line:10%
Just the fact that it
rotated and the city lights

00:11:30.900 --> 00:11:35.340 align:middle line:10%
reflected off the bottom
allowed some to watch it.

00:11:35.340 --> 00:11:40.710 align:middle line:10%
According to Alex, the object
was there for at least an hour.

00:11:40.710 --> 00:11:43.723 align:middle line:84%
>> Did you see the object
for what, one hour there?

00:11:43.723 --> 00:11:45.390 align:middle line:84%
I mean, when you were
there, you still--

00:11:45.390 --> 00:11:49.530 align:middle line:84%
even though you didn't record
it, you still saw the object?

00:11:49.530 --> 00:11:50.880 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:11:50.880 --> 00:11:55.550 align:middle line:84%
When we were going out, over the
cemetery is quite a long way.

00:11:55.550 --> 00:11:57.940 align:middle line:90%
We were seeing it.

00:11:57.940 --> 00:12:00.120 align:middle line:90%
But then it's gone.

00:12:00.120 --> 00:12:01.580 align:middle line:90%
>> Do you know--

00:12:01.580 --> 00:12:05.010 align:middle line:84%
>> It was not like flew
away, it was not obscured.

00:12:05.010 --> 00:12:07.380 align:middle line:10%
It's just like in
a blink of an eye.

00:12:07.380 --> 00:12:09.630 align:middle line:10%
It was there, and
another second, it's

00:12:09.630 --> 00:12:10.830 align:middle line:10%
not there, like that.

00:12:10.830 --> 00:12:13.510 align:middle line:10%


00:12:13.510 --> 00:12:14.370 align:middle line:10%
It's not there.

00:12:14.370 --> 00:12:15.940 align:middle line:90%
>> Just disappeared.

00:12:15.940 --> 00:12:16.970 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:12:16.970 --> 00:12:18.490 align:middle line:90%
>> Momentary.

00:12:18.490 --> 00:12:21.400 align:middle line:10%
>> Have many people approached
you to have an interview with

00:12:21.400 --> 00:12:22.770 align:middle line:10%
you?

00:12:22.770 --> 00:12:24.010 align:middle line:10%
>> You are the third person.

00:12:24.010 --> 00:12:27.530 align:middle line:90%


00:12:27.530 --> 00:12:30.820 align:middle line:10%
>> I think it's very important.

00:12:30.820 --> 00:12:31.620 align:middle line:90%
>> I agree.

00:12:31.620 --> 00:12:33.080 align:middle line:90%
It's important.

00:12:33.080 --> 00:12:34.680 align:middle line:90%
And I may be wrong.

00:12:34.680 --> 00:12:37.550 align:middle line:10%
I would love to be wrong, and
then if this is [INAUDIBLE]

00:12:37.550 --> 00:12:42.440 align:middle line:84%
this is cool, because
something evil will happen.

00:12:42.440 --> 00:12:44.750 align:middle line:10%
We opened everything.

00:12:44.750 --> 00:12:48.190 align:middle line:84%
There is no place
for adventures.

00:12:48.190 --> 00:12:54.445 align:middle line:10%
We have-- but the only place
which is left for unknown

00:12:54.445 --> 00:12:56.260 align:middle line:10%
is space.

00:12:56.260 --> 00:12:57.180 align:middle line:10%
That's what I think.

00:12:57.180 --> 00:12:59.370 align:middle line:10%
So it's important, yes.

00:12:59.370 --> 00:13:00.720 align:middle line:10%

00:13:02.070 --> 00:13:05.250 align:middle line:84%
>> To Alex, as well
as other witnesses,

00:13:05.250 --> 00:13:10.200 align:middle line:84%
the object seemed to be secret
technology, a new type of ship,

00:13:10.200 --> 00:13:15.460 align:middle line:84%
anything but an
extraterrestrial ship.

some sort of mirage, miracle,

00:13:27.970 --> 00:13:28.820 align:middle line:10%
I didn't know.

00:13:28.820 --> 00:13:30.810 align:middle line:10%
I didn't understand what I see.

00:13:33.410 --> 00:13:34.910 align:middle line:10%
That's why I shot it.

00:13:34.910 --> 00:13:39.740 align:middle line:10%
I thought that if I will
upload it on YouTube,

00:13:39.740 --> 00:13:42.680 align:middle line:10%
people will say to
me, "What is this?"

00:13:42.680 --> 00:13:45.690 align:middle line:90%
But they don't know, too.

00:13:45.690 --> 00:13:47.010 align:middle line:90%
>> How high it was?

00:13:47.010 --> 00:13:48.970 align:middle line:84%
Have you considered
how high it was?

00:13:48.970 --> 00:13:52.230 align:middle line:90%


00:13:52.230 --> 00:14:00.810 align:middle line:10%
>> I suppose 100 meters
maybe 200 meters,

00:14:00.810 --> 00:14:07.070 align:middle line:10%
not very far from the Pentagon.

00:14:07.070 --> 00:14:08.690 align:middle line:90%

00:14:08.690 --> 00:14:12.760 align:middle line:90%


00:14:12.760 --> 00:14:18.460 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, it was 12
Pentagon windows long.

00:14:18.460 --> 00:14:20.810 align:middle line:90%
>> 12 pentagon windows long.

00:14:20.810 --> 00:14:21.610 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:14:21.610 --> 00:14:25.510 align:middle line:84%
>> Like, what 100 meters,
200 meters probably?

00:14:25.510 --> 00:14:27.510 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes, very close.

would have been one of the most

important investigators of the
case that occurred in Russia

00:14:35.720 --> 00:14:39.740 align:middle line:84%
in December 2009, analyzed
the videos and listened

00:14:39.740 --> 00:14:41.640 align:middle line:90%
to the testimonies.

00:14:41.640 --> 00:14:45.080 align:middle line:84%
>> I looked at the videos and
watched some of the witnesses

00:14:45.080 --> 00:14:46.520 align:middle line:84%
that you were able
to track down.

00:14:46.520 --> 00:14:49.640 align:middle line:84%
I want to congratulate you on
tracking down those witnesses.

00:14:49.640 --> 00:14:53.120 align:middle line:84%
I think that's very
important what you've done

00:14:53.120 --> 00:14:57.680 align:middle line:84%
and to have that corroboration
that these videos that

00:14:57.680 --> 00:15:00.560 align:middle line:84%
were uploaded to the
internet showing that,

00:15:00.560 --> 00:15:05.130 align:middle line:84%
again, a four-sided triangular
shaped, like a tetrahedron

00:15:05.130 --> 00:15:09.080 align:middle line:84%
floating over the Pentagon
in the early morning

00:15:09.080 --> 00:15:12.680 align:middle line:90%
hours of December 19.

00:15:12.680 --> 00:15:16.910 align:middle line:84%
That this was something
that was very large, again.

00:15:16.910 --> 00:15:20.360 align:middle line:84%
It looked like it was identical
to the one over the Kremlin

00:15:20.360 --> 00:15:22.700 align:middle line:90%
in terms of size and appearance.

00:15:22.700 --> 00:15:25.100 align:middle line:84%
This was something
that, again, we

00:15:25.100 --> 00:15:30.320 align:middle line:84%
have the same example where the
Pentagon did not announce this

00:15:30.320 --> 00:15:33.680 align:middle line:84%
or the US government did not
announce this in any way.

00:15:33.680 --> 00:15:36.260 align:middle line:90%
They tried to keep it silent.

00:15:36.260 --> 00:15:41.910 align:middle line:84%
The media reaction to this was
kind of like very, very rare.

00:15:41.910 --> 00:15:44.600 align:middle line:84%
I think there was just a
few British tabloids that

00:15:44.600 --> 00:15:45.710 align:middle line:90%
ran stories on it.

00:15:45.710 --> 00:15:48.980 align:middle line:84%
The American media was
pretty silent on it.

00:15:48.980 --> 00:15:50.990 align:middle line:84%
And, again, this
is the same kind

00:15:50.990 --> 00:15:55.880 align:middle line:84%
of strategy, which is when
you have extraterrestrials

00:15:55.880 --> 00:16:00.770 align:middle line:84%
appearing over major
global facilities,

00:16:00.770 --> 00:16:03.110 align:middle line:84%
the reaction by the
major governments

00:16:03.110 --> 00:16:06.830 align:middle line:84%
is to ignore it, not to try
to engage with it militarily,

00:16:06.830 --> 00:16:10.220 align:middle line:84%
because they know that they
don't have the technology

00:16:10.220 --> 00:16:12.350 align:middle line:90%
to destroy that kind of craft.

00:16:12.350 --> 00:16:15.680 align:middle line:84%
And so this was
something that, I think,

00:16:15.680 --> 00:16:21.620 align:middle line:84%
the Pentagon decided to just
not try to respond militarily,

00:16:21.620 --> 00:16:24.640 align:middle line:84%
not give it any
publicity at all,

00:16:24.640 --> 00:16:28.850 align:middle line:84%
and watch the issue kind
of die away in the media.

00:16:28.850 --> 00:16:32.960 align:middle line:84%
>> Why do you think
has happened this time?

00:16:32.960 --> 00:16:34.820 align:middle line:90%
>> I think the same thing.

00:16:34.820 --> 00:16:39.470 align:middle line:84%
Basically, the message is
that the Pentagon really

00:16:39.470 --> 00:16:42.950 align:middle line:84%
needs to pursue
peaceful solutions

00:16:42.950 --> 00:16:44.150 align:middle line:90%
to international problems.

00:16:44.150 --> 00:16:47.240 align:middle line:84%
That we cannot-- that the
Pentagon is the world's largest

00:16:47.240 --> 00:16:48.170 align:middle line:90%
military--

00:16:48.170 --> 00:16:51.740 align:middle line:84%
it cannot just go out
and continue to do,

00:16:51.740 --> 00:16:54.920 align:middle line:84%
start military interventions
around the planet,

00:16:54.920 --> 00:16:58.370 align:middle line:84%
and to really promote
peaceful solutions

00:16:58.370 --> 00:17:00.560 align:middle line:90%
to humanity's problems.

00:17:00.560 --> 00:17:05.060 align:middle line:84%
And also to take steps to tell
the truth-- that we are not

00:17:05.060 --> 00:17:10.970 align:middle line:84%
alone, that there is a large
galactic society out there that

00:17:10.970 --> 00:17:13.609 align:middle line:84%
are part of something
like a galactic federation

00:17:13.609 --> 00:17:17.000 align:middle line:84%
and want us to join, that
they see us as ready to join.

00:17:17.000 --> 00:17:20.060 align:middle line:84%
And the one thing that
stops us from joining

00:17:20.060 --> 00:17:23.910 align:middle line:84%
is that we are not united
politically as a planet.

00:17:23.910 --> 00:17:26.660 align:middle line:10%
We are still fighting
amongst each other.

00:17:26.660 --> 00:17:30.320 align:middle line:10%
We have all of the
huge resources going

00:17:30.320 --> 00:17:33.110 align:middle line:10%
into developing
military technologies

00:17:33.110 --> 00:17:35.810 align:middle line:10%
when really we
should be fostering

00:17:35.810 --> 00:17:38.840 align:middle line:10%
as many peaceful solutions
to international problems as

00:17:38.840 --> 00:17:42.710 align:middle line:10%
possible, trying to help
citizens in every country

00:17:42.710 --> 00:17:45.860 align:middle line:10%
live prosperous
and healthy lives

00:17:45.860 --> 00:17:51.700 align:middle line:10%
rather than continue down this
path of conflict and disunity.

00:17:51.700 --> 00:17:55.880 align:middle line:10%
And I think this is why
the secrecy is maintained

00:17:55.880 --> 00:17:57.680 align:middle line:10%
because governments
don't want us

00:17:57.680 --> 00:17:59.960 align:middle line:10%
to know the truth that
extraterrestrials are here

00:17:59.960 --> 00:18:04.040 align:middle line:10%
to help us unite as a
planet in a peaceful way

00:18:04.040 --> 00:18:09.260 align:middle line:10%
where technology can be spread
in a way to uplift us all.

00:18:09.260 --> 00:18:13.370 align:middle line:84%
But major governments and
elite groups don't want this.

sightings that that had happened

in December 2009 over the
Kremlin and again in December

important, because, basically,

00:21:06.120 --> 00:21:09.660 align:middle line:84%
the occupants of those
craft, who I believe are

00:21:09.660 --> 00:21:14.640 align:middle line:84%
extraterrestrials, basically
are wanting to promote peaceful

00:21:14.640 --> 00:21:17.040 align:middle line:84%
solutions to
international conflict.

00:21:17.040 --> 00:21:22.360 align:middle line:10%
And they appeared over the
two major military complexes

00:21:22.360 --> 00:21:24.900 align:middle line:10%
on the planet, the
complexes that are probably

00:21:24.900 --> 00:21:28.170 align:middle line:10%
most responsible
for most of the wars

00:21:28.170 --> 00:21:30.120 align:middle line:10%
that have occurred
around the planet,

00:21:30.120 --> 00:21:34.260 align:middle line:10%
and, basically, signaling to
the Kremlin and to the Pentagon,

00:21:34.260 --> 00:21:37.050 align:middle line:10%
we know you have
advanced technologies,

00:21:37.050 --> 00:21:40.260 align:middle line:10%
but those technologies
will not work against us,

00:21:40.260 --> 00:21:44.570 align:middle line:10%
and that you really need to
go down the path of peace.

00:21:44.570 --> 00:21:49.230 align:middle line:84%
And I think the fact that
in 2009 that the Kremlin

00:21:49.230 --> 00:21:51.090 align:middle line:84%
sighting occurred
at the same time

00:21:51.090 --> 00:21:56.550 align:middle line:84%
as President Obama was giving
a speech in commemoration

00:21:56.550 --> 00:22:00.420 align:middle line:84%
of his Nobel Peace Prize, I
think that that was really

00:22:00.420 --> 00:22:03.570 align:middle line:84%
a sign that these
sightings are all

00:22:03.570 --> 00:22:06.160 align:middle line:90%
about promoting a world peace.

00:22:06.160 --> 00:22:08.070 align:middle line:84%
And that's what the
extraterrestrials want.

00:22:08.070 --> 00:22:10.650 align:middle line:84%
And that's what humanity
desperately needs.

what few coins she has to
send that child to school,

00:22:48.800 --> 00:22:50.720 align:middle line:10%
because she believes
that a cruel world still

00:22:50.720 --> 00:22:55.550 align:middle line:10%
has a place for
that child's dreams.

be with us, and still
strive for justice.

and still strive for dignity.

understand that there

00:23:14.130 --> 00:23:18.690 align:middle line:10%
will be war, and still
strive for peace.
