>> This is "Nuevo."

00:00:02.550 --> 00:00:05.540 align:middle line:84%
Shortly before his
death, Walter Haut

00:00:05.540 --> 00:00:08.240 align:middle line:84%
wrote a letter
before a notary where

00:00:08.240 --> 00:00:11.860 align:middle line:84%
he unveiled all the secrets
surrounding the plan that

00:00:11.860 --> 00:00:15.440 align:middle line:84%
was followed to disprove
the case of the alien ship

00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:18.600 align:middle line:90%
that crash landed in Roswell.

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:23.401 align:middle line:84%
Today on Nuevo, we present
that plan and the letter.

>> Gaia presents "Nuevo"
with Jaime Maussan.

00:00:41.102 --> 00:00:46.540 align:middle line:90%


00:00:46.540 --> 00:00:51.150 align:middle line:10%
>> No case in the history of the
extraterrestrial phenomenon has

00:00:51.150 --> 00:00:55.550 align:middle line:10%
garnered as many testimonials
as the case of Roswell.

00:00:55.550 --> 00:00:58.410 align:middle line:10%
Tom Carey and Don
Schmitt directed

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:01.080 align:middle line:10%
one of the most
thorough investigations

00:01:01.080 --> 00:01:02.680 align:middle line:10%
of a similar case.

00:01:02.680 --> 00:01:07.740 align:middle line:84%
They were able to speak with
at least 150 direct witnesses

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:11.650 align:middle line:84%
and 600 indirect
witnesses, people

00:01:11.650 --> 00:01:15.090 align:middle line:84%
very close to those who were
in contact with this case.

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:17.610 align:middle line:84%
It is a truly
extraordinary story

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:22.060 align:middle line:84%
investigated in every
detail, which we present here

00:01:22.060 --> 00:01:24.000 align:middle line:90%
on "Nuevo."

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:26.220 align:middle line:10%
>> Due to the
historical significance

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:29.550 align:middle line:10%
of extraterrestrial research,
firsthand testimonials were

00:01:29.550 --> 00:01:32.250 align:middle line:10%
made public by the
SyFy TV network.

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:34.800 align:middle line:10%
Because these important
witnesses have died,

00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:37.230 align:middle line:10%
SyFy gave us permission
to present them

00:01:37.230 --> 00:01:39.510 align:middle line:10%
in our Nuevo video programs.

00:01:39.510 --> 00:01:42.810 align:middle line:84%
Our first comments come from
Lieutenant Jack Trowbridge,

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:46.110 align:middle line:84%
who had the chance to see
firsthand the remains recovered

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:49.620 align:middle line:84%
by the lieutenant of military
intelligence Jesse Marcel.

00:01:49.620 --> 00:01:55.020 align:middle line:84%
>> My name is Jack Trowbridge,
and I was assigned to Roswell

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:59.400 align:middle line:90%
in April of 1947.

00:01:59.400 --> 00:02:03.690 align:middle line:84%
I was further assigned
into intelligence

00:02:03.690 --> 00:02:09.100 align:middle line:84%
with Jesse Marcel, who was the
head of intelligence, a major.

00:02:09.100 --> 00:02:11.850 align:middle line:90%
I was a first lieutenant.

00:02:11.850 --> 00:02:16.140 align:middle line:84%
We were having bridge
at Major Marcel's home.

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:18.900 align:middle line:90%


00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:22.200 align:middle line:90%
He was there in a basket.

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:25.170 align:middle line:84%
My wife was there and
all of intelligence

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:29.270 align:middle line:84%
was there playing
bridge except Jesse.

00:02:29.270 --> 00:02:32.290 align:middle line:84%
He was out with a pickup
gathering his junk

00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:35.820 align:middle line:90%
in the debris field, OK?

00:02:35.820 --> 00:02:40.930 align:middle line:84%
So when you came in it was
fairly late, I believe.

00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:43.140 align:middle line:84%
And we broke up the
bridge game then

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:47.490 align:middle line:84%
to go out and see what
Jess had brought in.

00:02:47.490 --> 00:02:51.120 align:middle line:90%
And it was of great interest.

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:56.280 align:middle line:90%
It was aluminum in appearance.

00:02:56.280 --> 00:03:01.470 align:middle line:84%
There were fragments of
aircraft scanner, whatever

00:03:01.470 --> 00:03:06.110 align:middle line:84%
the thing was, and
also some girders

00:03:06.110 --> 00:03:12.360 align:middle line:84%
with pictures of
hieroglyphic-like things on it.

00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:17.020 align:middle line:84%
I took them to be
owls, but who knows.

00:03:17.020 --> 00:03:18.840 align:middle line:90%
Anyhow, it was interesting.

00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:21.900 align:middle line:84%
I did get to handle
the material,

00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:28.290 align:middle line:84%
and the material had
some peculiar properties.

00:03:28.290 --> 00:03:32.310 align:middle line:84%
For instance, it looked
like Hershey bar wrappings.

00:03:32.310 --> 00:03:35.910 align:middle line:84%
But you squeeze it up in your
hand as hard as you could, let

00:03:35.910 --> 00:03:41.840 align:middle line:84%
go, and it returned originally
to the original shape

00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:43.450 align:middle line:90%
instantly.

00:03:43.450 --> 00:03:46.960 align:middle line:84%
Then the next day Jesse
brought some of the stuff

00:03:46.960 --> 00:03:51.060 align:middle line:90%
into the intelligence office.

00:03:51.060 --> 00:03:54.750 align:middle line:84%
And we looked at it and
played with it awhile

00:03:54.750 --> 00:03:58.050 align:middle line:84%
and then everybody
went back to work.

00:03:58.050 --> 00:04:01.790 align:middle line:90%
Later that day, boom.

00:04:01.790 --> 00:04:08.880 align:middle line:84%
Nobody knows anything, shut up,
nothing happened, et cetera.

00:04:08.880 --> 00:04:13.990 align:middle line:84%
And when you're in the service,
you do what they say to them.

00:04:13.990 --> 00:04:19.709 align:middle line:84%
Major Marcel was
called up to Fort Worth

00:04:19.709 --> 00:04:22.740 align:middle line:90%
to show the press what he found.

00:04:22.740 --> 00:04:27.720 align:middle line:84%
Well, what he had
to show at the press

00:04:27.720 --> 00:04:30.300 align:middle line:90%
was really a weather balloon.

00:04:30.300 --> 00:04:35.490 align:middle line:84%
This stuff was not a weather
balloon, what he brought back.

00:04:35.490 --> 00:04:42.330 align:middle line:84%
So he was forced to lie
to the press we say.

00:04:42.330 --> 00:04:44.520 align:middle line:84%
I don't think he was
too happy about it,

00:04:44.520 --> 00:04:46.670 align:middle line:84%
but you do what
you're told, again.

00:04:46.670 --> 00:04:49.350 align:middle line:90%


00:04:49.350 --> 00:04:50.460 align:middle line:90%
You're in the service.

00:04:50.460 --> 00:04:52.340 align:middle line:90%
You follow the orders.

00:04:52.340 --> 00:05:01.080 align:middle line:84%
And they were afraid of the
American public panicking

00:05:01.080 --> 00:05:02.970 align:middle line:90%
with this knowledge.

00:05:02.970 --> 00:05:04.870 align:middle line:84%
I don't think that
would have happened,

00:05:04.870 --> 00:05:12.220 align:middle line:84%
but the word came down from up
above and you do what it says.

00:05:12.220 --> 00:05:15.100 align:middle line:84%
>> Pat Bush was Miriam
Bush's sister-in-law,

00:05:15.100 --> 00:05:18.320 align:middle line:84%
the nurse who had viewed the
bodies of the dead aliens.

00:05:18.320 --> 00:05:20.440 align:middle line:84%
Pat said she received
death threats

00:05:20.440 --> 00:05:24.940 align:middle line:84%
because of what she knew, and in
the end she died mysteriously.

00:05:24.940 --> 00:05:28.160 align:middle line:84%
Her cause of death
was never understood.

00:05:28.160 --> 00:05:33.328 align:middle line:84%
>> I'm Pat Bush, and I was
married to George Bush,

00:05:33.328 --> 00:05:34.245 align:middle line:90%
the brother of Miriam.

00:05:34.245 --> 00:05:38.040 align:middle line:90%


00:05:38.040 --> 00:05:43.090 align:middle line:84%
And I am-- her name was Miriam
Titus whenever I knew her.

00:05:43.090 --> 00:05:47.700 align:middle line:84%
She worked at the hospital,
at the base hospital.

00:05:47.700 --> 00:05:51.310 align:middle line:84%
She was an executive secretary
there, had a high security

00:05:51.310 --> 00:05:52.110 align:middle line:90%
rating.

00:05:52.110 --> 00:05:54.450 align:middle line:84%
The head of the
hospital there came

00:05:54.450 --> 00:05:58.020 align:middle line:84%
to her one evening or
one afternoon and said,

00:05:58.020 --> 00:06:01.260 align:middle line:84%
I think there's something
you would like to see.

00:06:01.260 --> 00:06:04.620 align:middle line:84%
And he took her down
to the surgical suite

00:06:04.620 --> 00:06:07.140 align:middle line:84%
or whatever it was in
the hospital, where

00:06:07.140 --> 00:06:10.770 align:middle line:90%
they had brought these beings.

00:06:10.770 --> 00:06:15.810 align:middle line:84%
And they took her into
the room and she saw them.

00:06:15.810 --> 00:06:17.830 align:middle line:84%
They wouldn't let her
get close to them,

00:06:17.830 --> 00:06:22.560 align:middle line:84%
but she stood by the
doorway and looked at them.

00:06:22.560 --> 00:06:24.823 align:middle line:84%
As she was looking
at them, one of them

00:06:24.823 --> 00:06:31.256 align:middle line:84%
moved its middle
finger on its hand.

00:06:31.256 --> 00:06:33.170 align:middle line:90%
The hand moved.

00:06:33.170 --> 00:06:37.160 align:middle line:84%
So whatever it was was
living at that time.

00:06:37.160 --> 00:06:40.640 align:middle line:84%
She went home that
evening and she

00:06:40.640 --> 00:06:42.680 align:middle line:84%
was excited about
what she had seen.

00:06:42.680 --> 00:06:46.030 align:middle line:84%
And she sat at the dinner
table and told the family

00:06:46.030 --> 00:06:51.000 align:middle line:84%
what she had seen and what
they had told her had happened.

00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:54.620 align:middle line:84%
And they were all interested
and asked questions.

00:06:54.620 --> 00:06:59.180 align:middle line:84%
And the next day when
she came in from work,

00:06:59.180 --> 00:07:04.790 align:middle line:84%
she was very somber
and she just told them,

00:07:04.790 --> 00:07:08.350 align:middle line:84%
don't ever mention
what I told you

00:07:08.350 --> 00:07:11.780 align:middle line:84%
and don't ever ask
me anything about it.

00:07:11.780 --> 00:07:15.550 align:middle line:90%
And she was very frightened.

00:07:15.550 --> 00:07:17.880 align:middle line:84%
I felt very sorry
for her because she

00:07:17.880 --> 00:07:24.120 align:middle line:84%
lived a very frightened life
because they had told her

00:07:24.120 --> 00:07:26.940 align:middle line:84%
not to ever speak
of it again and what

00:07:26.940 --> 00:07:29.140 align:middle line:90%
the consequences would be.

00:07:29.140 --> 00:07:32.880 align:middle line:84%
And she was frightened her
whole life long about it.

00:07:32.880 --> 00:07:37.150 align:middle line:84%
She passed away in
this unusual way.

00:07:37.150 --> 00:07:41.100 align:middle line:84%
And we started looking at
things and talking to people

00:07:41.100 --> 00:07:43.440 align:middle line:84%
and realizing that many
of the other people that

00:07:43.440 --> 00:07:47.820 align:middle line:84%
were involved in it had
died mysterious deaths

00:07:47.820 --> 00:07:50.400 align:middle line:90%
or disappearances.

00:07:50.400 --> 00:07:59.670 align:middle line:84%
She was in a motel, and she
was not registered at the motel

00:07:59.670 --> 00:08:02.950 align:middle line:90%
under her name.

00:08:02.950 --> 00:08:09.780 align:middle line:10%
It was registered under
her sister's name,

00:08:09.780 --> 00:08:11.880 align:middle line:10%
which is very strange.

00:08:11.880 --> 00:08:14.260 align:middle line:84%
And her sister didn't
know she was there.

00:08:14.260 --> 00:08:19.770 align:middle line:84%
The authorities came in because
it was the sister's name

00:08:19.770 --> 00:08:29.490 align:middle line:84%
and address on the registration,
they called her home

00:08:29.490 --> 00:08:35.140 align:middle line:84%
and then she knew that her
sister had passed away.

00:08:35.140 --> 00:08:36.970 align:middle line:84%
When the police
came and everything,

00:08:36.970 --> 00:08:41.110 align:middle line:84%
they said that it had to be
a suicide, that the door was

00:08:41.110 --> 00:08:43.780 align:middle line:84%
locked from inside
like nobody could

00:08:43.780 --> 00:08:46.010 align:middle line:90%
lock the door from the inside.

00:08:46.010 --> 00:08:49.780 align:middle line:84%
And you know, it was all
kind of-- they skimmed

00:08:49.780 --> 00:08:55.470 align:middle line:84%
over the top of it and they
didn't go into any research,

00:08:55.470 --> 00:08:59.676 align:middle line:84%
try to find out
anything about her.

00:08:59.676 --> 00:09:06.370 align:middle line:84%
It just-- I just don't believe
that she killed herself.

00:09:06.370 --> 00:09:08.750 align:middle line:90%
I think somebody else did it.

00:09:08.750 --> 00:09:11.470 align:middle line:84%
There was something that
was being covered up

00:09:11.470 --> 00:09:13.930 align:middle line:84%
and evidently something
important enough

00:09:13.930 --> 00:09:17.880 align:middle line:84%
that they would kill
to keep it a secret.

00:09:17.880 --> 00:09:21.370 align:middle line:90%


00:09:21.370 --> 00:09:24.430 align:middle line:84%
>> Families received word that
their loved ones who would soon

00:09:24.430 --> 00:09:26.980 align:middle line:84%
be on their deathbed
wanted to talk.

00:09:26.980 --> 00:09:30.130 align:middle line:84%
This was the case of Walter
Haut, who passed away shortly

00:09:30.130 --> 00:09:32.020 align:middle line:90%
after he shared information.

00:09:32.020 --> 00:09:34.720 align:middle line:84%
Walter was in charge of
reporting relevant facts

00:09:34.720 --> 00:09:36.490 align:middle line:90%
on behalf of the Air Force.

00:09:36.490 --> 00:09:39.670 align:middle line:84%
Haut was the one who wrote the
controversial press release

00:09:39.670 --> 00:09:41.650 align:middle line:90%
that circulated the world.

00:09:41.650 --> 00:09:44.540 align:middle line:84%
>> Story that I put
out was very simple.

00:09:44.540 --> 00:09:48.340 align:middle line:84%
It was what Colonel
Blanchard said he wanted put

00:09:48.340 --> 00:09:49.930 align:middle line:90%
into a press release.

00:09:49.930 --> 00:09:52.810 align:middle line:84%
When the Colonel tells
a first lieutenant

00:09:52.810 --> 00:09:58.600 align:middle line:84%
almost verbatim what he wants
in a press release, guess what?

00:09:58.600 --> 00:09:59.770 align:middle line:90%
He gets.

00:09:59.770 --> 00:10:02.140 align:middle line:84%
You don't argue with
them and say, oh, I

00:10:02.140 --> 00:10:04.750 align:middle line:84%
think it'd sound
better if we said

00:10:04.750 --> 00:10:07.990 align:middle line:90%
it this way or the next way.

00:10:07.990 --> 00:10:13.720 align:middle line:90%
The answer to all was, Yes, sir.

00:10:13.720 --> 00:10:16.510 align:middle line:84%
>> So what exactly did
the press release say?

00:10:16.510 --> 00:10:19.390 align:middle line:84%
>> In essence, it
was very simple,

00:10:19.390 --> 00:10:24.070 align:middle line:84%
to the effect that we had in
our possession a flying saucer.

00:10:24.070 --> 00:10:28.660 align:middle line:84%
It was found on a ranch
up north of Roswell.

00:10:28.660 --> 00:10:34.810 align:middle line:84%
It was being flown to
General Ramey's office, that

00:10:34.810 --> 00:10:37.240 align:middle line:90%
being the next higher command.

00:10:37.240 --> 00:10:40.010 align:middle line:90%
That was the 8th Air Force.

00:10:40.010 --> 00:10:43.120 align:middle line:90%
And that was the end of it.

00:10:43.120 --> 00:10:45.430 align:middle line:90%
Pretty well orchestrated.

00:10:45.430 --> 00:10:50.170 align:middle line:84%
I think the thought
of handling it

00:10:50.170 --> 00:10:54.970 align:middle line:84%
that way came down from
Washington through channels.

00:10:54.970 --> 00:10:59.050 align:middle line:84%
And we were told that we were
all wrong, that it was just

00:10:59.050 --> 00:10:59.920 align:middle line:90%
a weather balloon.

00:10:59.920 --> 00:11:02.970 align:middle line:90%


00:11:02.970 --> 00:11:06.210 align:middle line:84%
>> Shortly before his
death, Walter Haut signed

00:11:06.210 --> 00:11:10.350 align:middle line:84%
a declaration before a notary
that was sealed and couldn't be

00:11:10.350 --> 00:11:13.270 align:middle line:90%
opened until after his death.

00:11:13.270 --> 00:11:15.360 align:middle line:84%
This is his textual
statement that

00:11:15.360 --> 00:11:21.420 align:middle line:84%
wasn't made public until after
he died on December 15, 2005.

00:11:21.420 --> 00:11:24.630 align:middle line:84%
These are the words from the
affidavit that Walter Haut

00:11:24.630 --> 00:11:28.830 align:middle line:90%
signed on December 26, 2002.

00:11:28.830 --> 00:11:30.510 align:middle line:90%
Witness-- Chris.

00:11:30.510 --> 00:11:33.210 align:middle line:90%
Notary-- Beverly Morgan.

00:11:33.210 --> 00:11:36.000 align:middle line:10%
My name is Walter G. Haut.

00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:41.740 align:middle line:10%
My address is 1405 West 7th
Street, Roswell, New Mexico.

00:11:41.740 --> 00:11:43.530 align:middle line:10%
I am now retired.

00:11:43.530 --> 00:11:47.730 align:middle line:10%
In July 1947, I was stationed
at the Roswell Army Air Base

00:11:47.730 --> 00:11:51.480 align:middle line:10%
in Roswell, New Mexico, serving
as the base Public Information

00:11:51.480 --> 00:11:52.620 align:middle line:10%
Officer.

00:11:52.620 --> 00:11:54.720 align:middle line:10%
I had spent the
4th of July weekend

00:11:54.720 --> 00:11:58.260 align:middle line:10%
at my private residence about 10
miles north of the base, which

00:11:58.260 --> 00:11:59.970 align:middle line:10%
was south of town.

00:11:59.970 --> 00:12:01.950 align:middle line:10%
I was aware that
someone had reported

00:12:01.950 --> 00:12:04.830 align:middle line:10%
the remains of a downed
vehicle by midmorning

00:12:04.830 --> 00:12:08.610 align:middle line:10%
after my return to duty
at the base on July 7th.

00:12:08.610 --> 00:12:11.970 align:middle line:84%
I was aware that Major Jesse
Marcel, head of intelligence,

00:12:11.970 --> 00:12:14.790 align:middle line:84%
was sent by the base commander,
Colonel William Blanchard,

00:12:14.790 --> 00:12:16.320 align:middle line:90%
to investigate.

00:12:16.320 --> 00:12:18.690 align:middle line:10%
By late in the
afternoon that same day,

00:12:18.690 --> 00:12:21.090 align:middle line:10%
I would learn that
additional civilian reports

00:12:21.090 --> 00:12:25.140 align:middle line:10%
came in regarding a second
site just north of Roswell.

00:12:25.140 --> 00:12:27.390 align:middle line:10%
I would spend the better
part of the day attending

00:12:27.390 --> 00:12:31.500 align:middle line:10%
to my regular duties, hearing
little, if anything, more.

00:12:31.500 --> 00:12:33.810 align:middle line:10%
On Tuesday morning,
July 8, I would

00:12:33.810 --> 00:12:37.800 align:middle line:10%
attend the regularly scheduled
staff meeting at 7:30 AM.

00:12:37.800 --> 00:12:39.780 align:middle line:10%
In addition to
Blanchard and Marcel,

00:12:39.780 --> 00:12:43.320 align:middle line:10%
Counterintelligence Captain
Sheridan Cavett and others

00:12:43.320 --> 00:12:44.920 align:middle line:10%
were in attendance.

00:12:44.920 --> 00:12:48.750 align:middle line:10%
The main topic of discussion was
reported by Marcel and Cavett

00:12:48.750 --> 00:12:51.000 align:middle line:10%
regarding an
extensive debris field

00:12:51.000 --> 00:12:56.250 align:middle line:10%
in Lincoln County, approximately
75 miles northwest of Roswell.

00:12:56.250 --> 00:12:58.620 align:middle line:84%
Blanchard indicated
some brief details

00:12:58.620 --> 00:13:02.760 align:middle line:84%
about the second site, located
40 miles north of town.

00:13:02.760 --> 00:13:06.090 align:middle line:84%
Samples of the wreckage were
passed around the table.

00:13:06.090 --> 00:13:09.240 align:middle line:84%
Walter Haut said they did
not resemble any material

00:13:09.240 --> 00:13:11.280 align:middle line:90%
he had ever seen in his life.

00:13:11.280 --> 00:13:15.300 align:middle line:10%
Pieces, which resembled metal
foil, thin but extremely

00:13:15.300 --> 00:13:17.760 align:middle line:10%
strong material, and
other pieces that

00:13:17.760 --> 00:13:20.640 align:middle line:10%
had unusual markings
along their length

00:13:20.640 --> 00:13:23.580 align:middle line:10%
all were touched and
handled by each man.

00:13:23.580 --> 00:13:28.020 align:middle line:10%
No one could identify the
remains of the crash debris.

00:13:28.020 --> 00:13:30.390 align:middle line:84%
One of the main concerns
discussed at the meeting

00:13:30.390 --> 00:13:33.300 align:middle line:84%
was whether to go public
or not with the discovery.

00:13:33.300 --> 00:13:35.670 align:middle line:84%
General Ramey
proposed a plan, which

00:13:35.670 --> 00:13:39.390 align:middle line:84%
I believe originated with
his bosses at the Pentagon.

00:13:39.390 --> 00:13:42.810 align:middle line:84%
Attention needed to be diverted
from the more important site

00:13:42.810 --> 00:13:46.380 align:middle line:84%
north of town by acknowledging
the other location.

00:13:46.380 --> 00:13:48.870 align:middle line:84%
Too many civilians
were already involved

00:13:48.870 --> 00:13:51.390 align:middle line:84%
and the press
already was informed.

00:13:51.390 --> 00:13:55.110 align:middle line:84%
I was not completely informed
how this would be accomplished.

00:13:55.110 --> 00:13:57.900 align:middle line:84%
At 9:30 AM, Colonel
Blanchard called me

00:13:57.900 --> 00:14:00.690 align:middle line:84%
and dictated the press release
of having in our possession

00:14:00.690 --> 00:14:02.100 align:middle line:90%
a flying disc.

00:14:02.100 --> 00:14:04.770 align:middle line:84%
I was to deliver the news
release to radio stations

00:14:04.770 --> 00:14:05.940 align:middle line:90%
and newspapers.

00:14:05.940 --> 00:14:07.920 align:middle line:84%
By the time news
had hit the wire,

00:14:07.920 --> 00:14:11.100 align:middle line:84%
my office was inundated
with phone calls, messages

00:14:11.100 --> 00:14:12.190 align:middle line:90%
stacked up.

00:14:12.190 --> 00:14:14.220 align:middle line:84%
And rather than deal with
it, Colonel Blanchard

00:14:14.220 --> 00:14:16.170 align:middle line:90%
suggested I go home.

00:14:16.170 --> 00:14:18.540 align:middle line:84%
Before leaving the
base, Colonel Blanchard

00:14:18.540 --> 00:14:23.160 align:middle line:84%
took me personally to Building
84, a B-29 hangar located

00:14:23.160 --> 00:14:25.410 align:middle line:90%
on the east side of the tarmac.

00:14:25.410 --> 00:14:27.240 align:middle line:84%
Upon first approaching
the building,

00:14:27.240 --> 00:14:29.580 align:middle line:84%
I observed that it
was under heavy guard

00:14:29.580 --> 00:14:32.190 align:middle line:90%
both outside and inside.

00:14:32.190 --> 00:14:35.040 align:middle line:84%
Once inside, I was permitted
from a safe distance

00:14:35.040 --> 00:14:38.970 align:middle line:84%
to first observe the object
just recovered north of town.

00:14:38.970 --> 00:14:42.060 align:middle line:84%
It was approximately 12
to 15 feet in length,

00:14:42.060 --> 00:14:45.210 align:middle line:84%
not quite as wide,
about six feet high,

00:14:45.210 --> 00:14:47.310 align:middle line:90%
and more of an egg shape.

00:14:47.310 --> 00:14:51.480 align:middle line:84%
Lighting was poor, but its
surface did appear metallic.

00:14:51.480 --> 00:14:56.130 align:middle line:84%
No windows, portholes, wings,
tail section, or landing gear

00:14:56.130 --> 00:14:57.810 align:middle line:90%
were visible.

00:14:57.810 --> 00:15:01.200 align:middle line:10%
Also from a distance, I was
able to see a couple of bodies

00:15:01.200 --> 00:15:03.330 align:middle line:10%
under a canvas tarpaulin.

00:15:03.330 --> 00:15:05.980 align:middle line:84%
Only the heads extended
beyond the covering

00:15:05.980 --> 00:15:09.000 align:middle line:84%
and I was not able to
make out any features.

00:15:09.000 --> 00:15:11.290 align:middle line:84%
The heads did appear
larger than normal,

00:15:11.290 --> 00:15:13.560 align:middle line:84%
and the contour of the
canvas over the bodies

00:15:13.560 --> 00:15:16.800 align:middle line:84%
suggested the size of
a 10-year-old child.

00:15:16.800 --> 00:15:19.350 align:middle line:10%
At a later date at
Blanchard's office,

00:15:19.350 --> 00:15:22.860 align:middle line:10%
he would extend his arm about
four feet above the floor

00:15:22.860 --> 00:15:25.320 align:middle line:10%
to indicate their height.

00:15:25.320 --> 00:15:28.080 align:middle line:10%
I was informed of a
temporary morgue set up

00:15:28.080 --> 00:15:31.020 align:middle line:10%
to accommodate the
recovered bodies.

00:15:31.020 --> 00:15:34.740 align:middle line:10%
I was aware two separate teams
would return to each site

00:15:34.740 --> 00:15:38.490 align:middle line:10%
months later for periodic
searches for any remaining

00:15:38.490 --> 00:15:39.810 align:middle line:10%
evidence.

00:15:39.810 --> 00:15:42.780 align:middle line:84%
I am convinced that what
I personally observed

00:15:42.780 --> 00:15:46.710 align:middle line:84%
was some type of craft and
its crew from outer space.

00:15:46.710 --> 00:15:50.203 align:middle line:90%

00:15:50.203 --> 00:15:56.690 align:middle line:90%


00:15:56.690 --> 00:16:00.890 align:middle line:84%
>> This document, written by
Walter Haut before a notary

00:16:00.890 --> 00:16:04.760 align:middle line:84%
to be released after his
death, has great implications,

00:16:04.760 --> 00:16:09.110 align:middle line:84%
not only because he is convinced
that the ship and the beings he

00:16:09.110 --> 00:16:14.810 align:middle line:84%
saw were not of this world,
because it reveals the plan

00:16:14.810 --> 00:16:18.770 align:middle line:84%
of the military to distract
attention from the crash that

00:16:18.770 --> 00:16:23.630 align:middle line:84%
occurred north of Roswell, where
a full ship was recovered with

00:16:23.630 --> 00:16:28.844 align:middle line:84%
at least four occupants,
one of them alive.

00:16:28.844 --> 00:16:31.310 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:16:31.310 --> 00:16:34.620 align:middle line:10%
>> It is unknown if this second
ship was part of the one that

00:16:34.620 --> 00:16:38.040 align:middle line:10%
crashed on the forest
ranch of Mac Brasel,

00:16:38.040 --> 00:16:41.490 align:middle line:10%
or if it was a second crash
ship that was affected by radars

00:16:41.490 --> 00:16:44.850 align:middle line:10%
in the area to protect the
facilities of the Los Alamos

00:16:44.850 --> 00:16:48.840 align:middle line:10%
plant, the only place in the
world where atomic bombs were

00:16:48.840 --> 00:16:51.450 align:middle line:10%
built during the 1940s.

00:16:51.450 --> 00:16:53.820 align:middle line:84%
After publishing news
in the local papers

00:16:53.820 --> 00:16:56.220 align:middle line:84%
and attracting the
attention of the media,

00:16:56.220 --> 00:16:58.680 align:middle line:84%
the findings were
later discredited,

00:16:58.680 --> 00:17:01.440 align:middle line:84%
saying that it was a
meteorological balloon

00:17:01.440 --> 00:17:03.810 align:middle line:84%
that the military had
launched for the first time

00:17:03.810 --> 00:17:05.430 align:middle line:90%
as an experiment.

00:17:05.430 --> 00:17:07.950 align:middle line:84%
This strategy continued
when questioned

00:17:07.950 --> 00:17:10.230 align:middle line:84%
about the extraterrestrial
facts that were

00:17:10.230 --> 00:17:12.240 align:middle line:90%
presented to the government.

00:17:12.240 --> 00:17:15.150 align:middle line:84%
Regardless of the credible
arguments and the evidence

00:17:15.150 --> 00:17:18.119 align:middle line:84%
presented, even if the
evidence was proven,

00:17:18.119 --> 00:17:20.069 align:middle line:84%
they would continue
to discredit it,

00:17:20.069 --> 00:17:23.040 align:middle line:84%
no matter how much
weight it may have had.

00:17:23.040 --> 00:17:26.400 align:middle line:84%
The media and public opinion
immediately lost interest

00:17:26.400 --> 00:17:29.220 align:middle line:90%
in the story about the aliens.

00:17:29.220 --> 00:17:32.070 align:middle line:84%
While the entire world
watched expectantly,

00:17:32.070 --> 00:17:35.040 align:middle line:84%
General Roger Ramey
presented the remains

00:17:35.040 --> 00:17:37.950 align:middle line:84%
of the meteorological
balloon, bearing witness

00:17:37.950 --> 00:17:40.710 align:middle line:90%
to Major Jesse Marcel's report.

00:17:40.710 --> 00:17:42.840 align:middle line:84%
We know differently--
that the ship

00:17:42.840 --> 00:17:46.380 align:middle line:84%
and the extraterrestrial
corpses from the site located

00:17:46.380 --> 00:17:50.670 align:middle line:84%
to the north of the city
were recovered in Roswell.

00:17:50.670 --> 00:17:52.920 align:middle line:10%
However, in the same
photographs taken

00:17:52.920 --> 00:17:54.750 align:middle line:10%
at the time the
remains of the balloon

00:17:54.750 --> 00:17:57.840 align:middle line:10%
were presented to the
media, General Ramey

00:17:57.840 --> 00:18:01.170 align:middle line:10%
can be observed holding
a document that today

00:18:01.170 --> 00:18:05.040 align:middle line:10%
is known as Ramey's Memorandum.

00:18:05.040 --> 00:18:08.430 align:middle line:10%
In that document, what is
written can now be seen.

00:18:08.430 --> 00:18:11.280 align:middle line:10%
And thanks to modern
digitized analysis,

00:18:11.280 --> 00:18:13.800 align:middle line:10%
two sentences have
been deciphered,

00:18:13.800 --> 00:18:18.390 align:middle line:10%
where one reads, and the
victims of the accident.

00:18:18.390 --> 00:18:20.340 align:middle line:10%
In the second line
it says, they will

00:18:20.340 --> 00:18:23.370 align:middle line:10%
be sent in the saucer ship.

00:18:23.370 --> 00:18:28.510 align:middle line:10%
Major Jesse Marcel
remains silent until 1977.

00:18:28.510 --> 00:18:30.690 align:middle line:84%
When he retired,
he decided to talk

00:18:30.690 --> 00:18:33.600 align:middle line:84%
about his own experience
in an interview

00:18:33.600 --> 00:18:37.955 align:middle line:84%
with a local TV
station, Channel 55.

00:18:37.955 --> 00:18:39.330 align:middle line:84%
>> They took
pictures, of course.

00:18:39.330 --> 00:18:41.870 align:middle line:84%
They had a whole flock
of microphones there.

00:18:41.870 --> 00:18:43.400 align:middle line:90%
They wanted me to--

00:18:43.400 --> 00:18:44.910 align:middle line:84%
they wanted some
comments from me,

00:18:44.910 --> 00:18:48.120 align:middle line:84%
but I wasn't at
liberty to do that.

00:18:48.120 --> 00:18:51.380 align:middle line:84%
So all I could do is
keep my mouth shut.

00:18:51.380 --> 00:18:55.100 align:middle line:84%
And General Ramey is the
one who discussed, or told

00:18:55.100 --> 00:18:58.715 align:middle line:84%
the newspapers, I
mean the newsman, what

00:18:58.715 --> 00:19:01.010 align:middle line:90%
it was and to forget about it.

00:19:01.010 --> 00:19:04.770 align:middle line:84%
It was nothing more than a
weather observation balloon.

00:19:04.770 --> 00:19:08.690 align:middle line:84%
Of course, which we
both knew differently.

00:19:08.690 --> 00:19:12.390 align:middle line:84%
>> On July 6, Major Marcel,
accompanied by Brasel

00:19:12.390 --> 00:19:16.050 align:middle line:84%
and another person from the
army, went to the forest ranch,

00:19:16.050 --> 00:19:19.530 align:middle line:84%
spent the night there, and on
the morning of July 6 arrived

00:19:19.530 --> 00:19:22.590 align:middle line:84%
at the scene of the accident,
where the crashed alien ship

00:19:22.590 --> 00:19:23.390 align:middle line:90%
was.

00:19:23.390 --> 00:19:26.060 align:middle line:90%


00:19:26.060 --> 00:19:28.990 align:middle line:84%
>> The following morning we went
out to the site where the crash

00:19:28.990 --> 00:19:32.380 align:middle line:84%
was and what I saw
I couldn't believe.

00:19:32.380 --> 00:19:34.060 align:middle line:90%
There was so much of it.

00:19:34.060 --> 00:19:36.760 align:middle line:84%
It was scattered over
such a vast area.

00:19:36.760 --> 00:19:40.570 align:middle line:84%
So we proceeded to pick up as
much of the debris as we could,

00:19:40.570 --> 00:19:42.790 align:middle line:90%
load it in our wagon.

00:19:42.790 --> 00:19:43.880 align:middle line:90%
We filled that up.

00:19:43.880 --> 00:19:45.380 align:middle line:84%
Took us a good part
of the day to do

00:19:45.380 --> 00:19:48.990 align:middle line:84%
that because it was
such small fragments

00:19:48.990 --> 00:19:51.250 align:middle line:84%
and we had to do
a lot of picking.

00:19:51.250 --> 00:19:55.780 align:middle line:84%
We found a piece of
metal about a foot

00:19:55.780 --> 00:19:59.583 align:middle line:84%
and a half to two feet wide, and
about two or three feet long.

00:19:59.583 --> 00:20:01.250 align:middle line:84%
Felt like you had
nothing in your hands.

00:20:01.250 --> 00:20:03.300 align:middle line:84%
It wasn't any
thicker than the foil

00:20:03.300 --> 00:20:05.720 align:middle line:90%
out of a pack of cigarettes.

00:20:05.720 --> 00:20:09.810 align:middle line:84%
But the thing about that it got
me is that you couldn't even

00:20:09.810 --> 00:20:12.060 align:middle line:90%
bend it, you couldn't dent it.

00:20:12.060 --> 00:20:14.840 align:middle line:84%
Even with a sledgehammer,
it would bounce off of it.

00:20:14.840 --> 00:20:18.610 align:middle line:84%
So I knew that I had never
seen anything like that before.

00:20:18.610 --> 00:20:21.730 align:middle line:84%
And as of now, I don't
know what it was.

00:20:21.730 --> 00:20:25.210 align:middle line:84%
>> Major Jesse Marcel is
convinced that the material

00:20:25.210 --> 00:20:28.270 align:middle line:84%
and the ship was
not from this world.

00:20:28.270 --> 00:20:32.263 align:middle line:84%
>> It was not anything from this
Earth, that I'm quite sure of.

00:20:32.263 --> 00:20:34.180 align:middle line:84%
Because I was-- being
an intelligence officer,

00:20:34.180 --> 00:20:38.290 align:middle line:84%
I was familiar with just about
all materials used in aircraft

00:20:38.290 --> 00:20:40.420 align:middle line:90%
and in our air travel.

00:20:40.420 --> 00:20:41.800 align:middle line:90%
This is nothing that.

00:20:41.800 --> 00:20:43.120 align:middle line:90%
It could not been.

00:20:43.120 --> 00:20:45.980 align:middle line:90%
It could not have been.

00:20:45.980 --> 00:20:49.310 align:middle line:84%
>> Major Jesse Marcel
was in charge of security

00:20:49.310 --> 00:20:53.720 align:middle line:84%
and intelligence for all nuclear
testing in the United States

00:20:53.720 --> 00:20:56.060 align:middle line:90%
and in the Pacific Ocean.

00:20:56.060 --> 00:20:59.540 align:middle line:84%
Major Marcel, one of the most
significant military witnesses

00:20:59.540 --> 00:21:04.850 align:middle line:84%
in this case, died in
1986 at the age of 79

00:21:04.850 --> 00:21:08.894 align:middle line:84%
shortly after giving
his exclusive interview.

00:21:08.894 --> 00:21:16.260 align:middle line:10%
>> [SPEAKING SPANISH]

00:21:16.260 --> 00:21:20.040 align:middle line:84%
>> Why did the witnesses keep
the Roswell incident secret?

00:21:20.040 --> 00:21:23.640 align:middle line:84%
Who forced them to remain
silent until, on their deathbed,

00:21:23.640 --> 00:21:27.000 align:middle line:84%
they would confess what
they found and experienced?

00:21:27.000 --> 00:21:30.790 align:middle line:84%
What really happened
so many years ago?

00:21:30.790 --> 00:21:32.760 align:middle line:84%
>> He said, it's
a big old desert.

00:21:32.760 --> 00:21:35.450 align:middle line:84%
Nobody will ever
find your bodies.

00:21:35.450 --> 00:21:37.130 align:middle line:84%
So we'll just bury
you out there.

00:21:37.130 --> 00:21:39.860 align:middle line:84%
Nobody will ever know
you were ever here.

00:21:39.860 --> 00:21:42.890 align:middle line:84%
So I promised I
wouldn't talk about it.

00:21:42.890 --> 00:21:44.658 align:middle line:84%
>> The government had
told those people,

00:21:44.658 --> 00:21:45.950 align:middle line:90%
there's a big desert out there.

00:21:45.950 --> 00:21:49.050 align:middle line:90%
You'll never be found.

00:21:49.050 --> 00:21:51.127 align:middle line:84%
That's pretty scary,
for your own government

00:21:51.127 --> 00:21:52.460 align:middle line:90%
to tell you something like that.

00:21:52.460 --> 00:21:55.760 align:middle line:84%
>> We have to continue to go
after the remaining witnesses.

00:21:55.760 --> 00:21:56.900 align:middle line:90%
We're running out of time.

00:21:56.900 --> 00:21:59.810 align:middle line:90%
Once they're gone, it's gone.

00:21:59.810 --> 00:22:04.520 align:middle line:84%
And we have to at least provide
them with an opportunity

00:22:04.520 --> 00:22:09.890 align:middle line:84%
to go on the record and tell
us through their eyes what they

00:22:09.890 --> 00:22:14.210 align:middle line:84%
saw, have them provide
to us the truth

00:22:14.210 --> 00:22:19.580 align:middle line:84%
that each and every one of us on
this planet so richly deserves.

00:22:19.580 --> 00:22:25.370 align:middle line:10%
>> This country was based on
the premise that it should be

00:22:25.370 --> 00:22:33.365 align:middle line:10%
an open society and that we
should not have a closed one.

00:22:33.365 --> 00:22:36.830 align:middle line:90%


00:22:36.830 --> 00:22:44.270 align:middle line:10%
And here, we have a
government, supposedly

00:22:44.270 --> 00:22:50.870 align:middle line:10%
the servant of the
people and not the people

00:22:50.870 --> 00:22:56.390 align:middle line:10%
being subjects of the
government, the people,

00:22:56.390 --> 00:23:03.410 align:middle line:10%
of course, being sovereigns and
therefore over the government.

00:23:03.410 --> 00:23:11.100 align:middle line:10%
We have the government keeping
it secret all these many years

00:23:11.100 --> 00:23:14.120 align:middle line:10%
from the people.

00:23:14.120 --> 00:23:20.560 align:middle line:10%
How can we have
the type of system

00:23:20.560 --> 00:23:29.020 align:middle line:10%
our founders set up if the
people do not know the truth?

00:23:29.020 --> 00:23:36.880 align:middle line:84%
The people have to know the
truth to make proper judgments.

00:23:36.880 --> 00:23:41.820 align:middle line:84%
We do not live in a
democracy in this country.

00:23:41.820 --> 00:23:44.890 align:middle line:84%
Now, make sure you
understand that one.

00:23:44.890 --> 00:23:50.410 align:middle line:84%
We live in a republic,
but the republic

00:23:50.410 --> 00:23:55.060 align:middle line:90%
is governed by the people.

00:23:55.060 --> 00:24:02.320 align:middle line:84%
And the government is by
the will of those governed.

00:24:02.320 --> 00:24:07.010 align:middle line:84%
And the people have
to know the truth

00:24:07.010 --> 00:24:11.160 align:middle line:90%
to make the right choices.

00:24:11.160 --> 00:24:16.100 align:middle line:90%
That is the whole issue.

00:24:16.100 --> 00:24:20.330 align:middle line:90%
That is what it's all about.

00:24:20.330 --> 00:24:22.260 align:middle line:90%
You asked the question.

00:24:22.260 --> 00:24:25.270 align:middle line:90%
That's the answer.

00:24:25.270 --> 00:24:27.432 align:middle line:90%
Does that make any sense?

recovered by the United
