It was the month
of October, and I

00:09:49.600 --> 00:09:52.690 align:middle line:84%
went to pick up my sister
Gloria at her school.

00:09:52.690 --> 00:09:54.910 align:middle line:84%
It was about 4:00
in the afternoon.

We returned home and
started preparing dinner.

00:09:57.730 --> 00:09:59.020 align:middle line:90%
I was in the kitchen.

00:09:59.020 --> 00:10:02.230 align:middle line:84%
Suddenly I turned my head and
looked towards the terrace

00:10:02.230 --> 00:10:07.150 align:middle line:84%
because I thought I
heard someone calling me.

00:10:07.150 --> 00:10:12.250 align:middle line:84%
I didn't see anyone so
I continued cooking.

00:10:12.250 --> 00:10:15.970 align:middle line:84%
Gloria went out on the
balcony since the evening air

00:10:15.970 --> 00:10:19.600 align:middle line:90%
was fresh and pleasant.

00:10:19.600 --> 00:10:22.000 align:middle line:90%
Suddenly I heard her voice.

00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:23.440 align:middle line:90%
Simona, come quickly!

00:10:23.440 --> 00:10:25.090 align:middle line:90%
Look at this!

00:10:25.090 --> 00:10:28.780 align:middle line:84%
Her tone sounded
with some urgency

00:10:28.780 --> 00:10:31.300 align:middle line:90%
so I went to see what it was.

00:10:31.300 --> 00:10:34.090 align:middle line:84%
Standing on the balcony
I saw that thing

00:10:34.090 --> 00:10:38.560 align:middle line:84%
that at first I did
not know what it was.

00:10:38.560 --> 00:10:42.180 align:middle line:84%
It was about a hundred
feet from the house.

00:10:42.180 --> 00:10:48.340 align:middle line:84%
It was something strange, dark,
and took two or three laps.

00:10:48.340 --> 00:10:51.100 align:middle line:84%
I tried to identify
the object, and then it

00:10:51.100 --> 00:10:55.600 align:middle line:84%
began to materialize
in the form of a horse,

00:10:55.600 --> 00:10:59.980 align:middle line:84%
large, perfectly
formed, well delineated.

00:10:59.980 --> 00:11:04.060 align:middle line:90%
Gloria and I were amazed.

00:11:04.060 --> 00:11:08.050 align:middle line:90%
Quickly we went to call Antonio.

It was incredible.

it made turns and movements

It made natural movements.

00:11:29.440 --> 00:11:33.430 align:middle line:84%
He was shaking his head,
although the rest of his body

00:11:33.430 --> 00:11:38.410 align:middle line:84%
seemed rigid, as if he were
sick, carrying a dead weight

Of course.

00:12:08.530 --> 00:12:11.410 align:middle line:84%
Seeing a flying
horse is not common.

00:12:11.410 --> 00:12:14.380 align:middle line:84%

in some old paintings.

The task of shooting hours

Filming a flying

You can shoot spaceships,
what we call UFOs,

and still many people
say that is impossible.

But filming a horse that flies
goes beyond believability.

So what do I think about
those who say it's a balloon?

00:13:49.270 --> 00:13:51.610 align:middle line:84%

because I would not

allow myself to tell such a
big lie, a deception, just

00:13:55.540 --> 00:13:59.050 align:middle line:90%

my sister and asked her

00:17:10.550 --> 00:17:17.089 align:middle line:84%
if she could see the
horse, and she said yes.

00:17:17.089 --> 00:17:22.325 align:middle line:84%
We both realized that it was
not a balloon but a horse.

00:17:22.325 --> 00:17:24.920 align:middle line:90%


00:17:24.920 --> 00:17:28.940 align:middle line:90%
A balloon cannot move its legs.

00:17:28.940 --> 00:17:33.110 align:middle line:84%
The figure moved
like a living being.

00:17:33.110 --> 00:17:37.040 align:middle line:90%
Slowly, it approached us.

00:17:37.040 --> 00:17:40.230 align:middle line:90%
It looked very large.

00:17:40.230 --> 00:17:43.640 align:middle line:90%
And then it began to move away.

It was almost like
seeing it life-size.

00:17:52.460 --> 00:17:55.511 align:middle line:90%

Like a horse walking in a

I saw the steady movements
of his slow and firm step.

00:18:10.370 --> 00:18:13.775 align:middle line:84%
And I'm pretty sure it
moved its tail and head.

00:18:24.380 --> 00:18:26.810 align:middle line:90%
He looked very spirited.

00:18:26.810 --> 00:18:30.020 align:middle line:90%
It was not a small horse.

00:18:30.020 --> 00:18:34.190 align:middle line:84%
It had all the elements
of an adult animal.

00:18:34.190 --> 00:18:35.990 align:middle line:90%
This is not normal.

00:18:35.990 --> 00:18:38.960 align:middle line:90%
You do not see this every day.

00:18:38.960 --> 00:18:41.450 align:middle line:90%
I was in shock.

00:18:41.450 --> 00:18:45.860 align:middle line:84%
That's why I called
Simona to see him too.

00:18:45.860 --> 00:18:49.190 align:middle line:90%
I thought I was seeing things.

00:18:49.190 --> 00:18:53.990 align:middle line:84%
So when she saw it too,
I knew it was true.

00:18:53.990 --> 00:18:57.410 align:middle line:84%
Then we called Antonio who
arrived with a video camera

00:18:57.410 --> 00:18:59.420 align:middle line:90%
and filmed everything.

00:18:59.420 --> 00:19:00.650 align:middle line:90%
It was impressive.

I think they ignore
and deny the facts.

00:19:11.630 --> 00:19:15.830 align:middle line:84%
They think it's a
lot of nonsense.

00:19:15.830 --> 00:19:20.210 align:middle line:84%
They want to make us feel
that we are making it up.

00:19:20.210 --> 00:19:25.670 align:middle line:84%
When they say to me that it is
not true, I just ignore them.

00:19:25.670 --> 00:19:30.950 align:middle line:84%
It is useless to try to explain
the evidence and what I saw.

00:19:30.950 --> 00:19:34.710 align:middle line:84%
Also, there were
other witnesses.

00:19:34.710 --> 00:19:39.160 align:middle line:90%
There's not much else I can do.

00:19:39.160 --> 00:19:43.570 align:middle line:84%
>> Also in January, 2007,
Antonio Urzi expressed his

00:19:43.570 --> 00:19:46.240 align:middle line:90%
comments on this strange event.

00:19:46.240 --> 00:19:48.340 align:middle line:84%
Urzi had started
his recording when

00:19:48.340 --> 00:19:50.320 align:middle line:84%
the horse was no
longer as close as it

00:19:50.320 --> 00:19:51.972 align:middle line:90%
had been when he first saw it.

>> [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

00:19:52.930 --> 00:20:00.050 align:middle line:84%
When I turned on the camera, the
horse had already moved away.

00:20:00.050 --> 00:20:04.750 align:middle line:84%
It was beyond that tree
which is in the foreground.

00:20:04.750 --> 00:20:09.160 align:middle line:84%
When Simona saw him, he was
standing in that direction

00:20:09.160 --> 00:20:12.730 align:middle line:90%
near the top of that building.

00:20:12.730 --> 00:20:18.290 align:middle line:84%
And the dimensions of the
animal were more than six feet,

00:20:18.290 --> 00:20:19.090 align:middle line:90%
like a real horse.

00:20:19.090 --> 00:20:22.510 align:middle line:90%


00:20:22.510 --> 00:20:28.900 align:middle line:84%
When I saw it there, where that
antenna is, the second antenna,

00:20:28.900 --> 00:20:33.060 align:middle line:84%
it was noticeable that
it was a real horse.

00:20:33.060 --> 00:20:38.320 align:middle line:84%
It was behind the first
antenna to the left.

00:20:38.320 --> 00:20:41.500 align:middle line:84%
Then that's when I realized
it was a real thing,

00:20:41.500 --> 00:20:43.165 align:middle line:90%
and he was moving very slowly.

00:20:43.165 --> 00:20:45.940 align:middle line:90%


00:20:45.940 --> 00:20:48.760 align:middle line:84%
Then I took the camera and
positioned myself here.

00:20:48.760 --> 00:20:52.560 align:middle line:90%


00:20:52.560 --> 00:20:58.450 align:middle line:84%
And when it came near the
tree and the larger antenna,

00:20:58.450 --> 00:20:59.380 align:middle line:90%
I settled here.

00:20:59.380 --> 00:21:02.200 align:middle line:90%


00:21:02.200 --> 00:21:03.685 align:middle line:84%
Then I started to
use the camera.

00:21:03.685 --> 00:21:09.340 align:middle line:90%


00:21:09.340 --> 00:21:13.990 align:middle line:84%
It did not look clear
in the viewfinder,

00:21:13.990 --> 00:21:17.380 align:middle line:84%
so I changed places
and recorded again.

00:21:17.380 --> 00:21:20.800 align:middle line:84%
It was not easy to focus,
but I just tried again.

00:21:20.800 --> 00:21:23.380 align:middle line:90%


00:21:23.380 --> 00:21:30.100 align:middle line:84%
Normally when I zoom, I have
a closeup of the object.

00:21:30.100 --> 00:21:33.760 align:middle line:84%
My heart was beating a
thousand times a minute.

00:21:33.760 --> 00:21:36.310 align:middle line:84%
When I was standing
there, I managed

00:21:36.310 --> 00:21:39.395 align:middle line:84%
to see that it was
wagging its tail.

00:21:39.395 --> 00:21:41.320 align:middle line:90%
And what a view.

00:21:41.320 --> 00:21:44.710 align:middle line:84%
You can clearly see how the
tail moves, and also the legs,

00:21:44.710 --> 00:21:47.455 align:middle line:90%
very, very slowly.

00:21:47.455 --> 00:21:50.410 align:middle line:84%
It was something I will never
forget for the rest of my life.

00:21:50.410 --> 00:21:54.280 align:middle line:90%


00:21:54.280 --> 00:21:58.840 align:middle line:84%
Simona was beside me
and I asked her, Simona,

00:21:58.840 --> 00:22:00.220 align:middle line:90%
what do you think that is?

00:22:00.220 --> 00:22:02.920 align:middle line:90%


00:22:02.920 --> 00:22:06.080 align:middle line:84%
Where I was standing
the door was closed,

00:22:06.080 --> 00:22:08.830 align:middle line:84%
so I opened a nearby
window and said, let's see.

00:22:08.830 --> 00:22:11.800 align:middle line:90%


00:22:11.800 --> 00:22:13.510 align:middle line:84%
Viewing from this
position made it

00:22:13.510 --> 00:22:16.960 align:middle line:84%
easy to see that it
was not a balloon.

00:22:16.960 --> 00:22:20.080 align:middle line:84%
Obviously it was not, even
though many people denied

00:22:20.080 --> 00:22:22.360 align:middle line:90%
the evidence.

00:22:22.360 --> 00:22:26.620 align:middle line:84%
They say it does not look
real, it could be a balloon.

00:22:26.620 --> 00:22:31.480 align:middle line:84%
They try to deny the evidences,
but it was not like that.

00:22:31.480 --> 00:22:34.030 align:middle line:84%
If we make a comparison
taking specific points

00:22:34.030 --> 00:22:37.430 align:middle line:84%
as a reference of the
surroundings, the antennas,

00:22:37.430 --> 00:22:41.380 align:middle line:84%
the tree, we can see the
real size of the animal.

00:22:41.380 --> 00:22:43.798 align:middle line:84%
It is not possible
that it was a balloon.

00:22:43.798 --> 00:22:45.340 align:middle line:84%
If we were to film
a balloon inflated

00:22:45.340 --> 00:22:47.740 align:middle line:84%
with helium for
five or six minutes,

00:22:47.740 --> 00:22:49.930 align:middle line:84%
we would see how it
rises and disappears.

00:22:49.930 --> 00:22:52.900 align:middle line:90%


00:22:52.900 --> 00:22:58.960 align:middle line:84%
This figure was moving
horizontally while maintaining

00:22:58.960 --> 00:23:02.245 align:middle line:84%
the same height, and
that cannot be denied.

00:23:02.245 --> 00:23:04.970 align:middle line:90%


00:23:04.970 --> 00:23:08.570 align:middle line:84%

we asked Antonio to verify his

statement about the experience
with the horse he had filmed

00:23:11.660 --> 00:23:13.770 align:middle line:90%

00:23:15.820 --> 00:23:18.070 align:middle line:84%
The video of the horse
is very interesting

00:23:18.070 --> 00:23:22.235 align:middle line:84%
because it was something
entirely different.

00:23:22.235 --> 00:23:26.110 align:middle line:84%
And my niece Gloria called
me saying, come quick.

00:23:26.110 --> 00:23:28.200 align:middle line:84%
There is an incredible
thing in the sky.

00:23:28.200 --> 00:23:30.710 align:middle line:90%
It looks like a horse.

00:23:30.710 --> 00:23:32.670 align:middle line:84%
And that was the
impression of the girl.

00:23:32.670 --> 00:23:36.040 align:middle line:90%


00:23:36.040 --> 00:23:38.200 align:middle line:90%
I always have the camera ready.

00:23:38.200 --> 00:23:40.300 align:middle line:84%
When I get to the
balcony, I immediately

00:23:40.300 --> 00:23:41.965 align:middle line:84%
realize that it
is not a balloon.

00:23:41.965 --> 00:23:45.010 align:middle line:90%


00:23:45.010 --> 00:23:50.200 align:middle line:84%
With a reference point,
the antenna of the house,

00:23:50.200 --> 00:23:52.060 align:middle line:84%
it was easy to
calculate and verify

00:23:52.060 --> 00:23:58.960 align:middle line:84%
that this was not a balloon,
not only by the dimensions

00:23:58.960 --> 00:24:06.190 align:middle line:84%
but by the way it was
moving its legs as well

00:24:06.190 --> 00:24:12.040 align:middle line:90%
as its tail and even the head.

00:24:12.040 --> 00:24:13.930 align:middle line:84%
Anyone can see by
watching the video.

00:24:13.930 --> 00:24:17.200 align:middle line:90%


00:24:17.200 --> 00:24:22.550 align:middle line:84%
Then he moved from left to
right and from right to left.

00:24:22.550 --> 00:24:25.865 align:middle line:84%
All those movements were
languid as if trotting calmly.

00:24:31.120 --> 00:24:34.810 align:middle line:84%
It was evident that this
was not a plastic figure

00:24:34.810 --> 00:24:36.120 align:middle line:90%
since he was moving freely.

00:24:36.120 --> 00:24:39.400 align:middle line:90%


00:24:39.400 --> 00:24:41.095 align:middle line:84%
It was not a balloon
that had escaped.

00:24:41.095 --> 00:24:45.370 align:middle line:90%


00:24:45.370 --> 00:24:49.420 align:middle line:84%
It was making movements
that were controlled.

00:24:49.420 --> 00:24:52.850 align:middle line:84%
You can see the
movements in the video.

00:24:52.850 --> 00:24:55.410 align:middle line:84%
Then it began to drift
away more and more

00:24:55.410 --> 00:24:59.080 align:middle line:90%
until it became a small point.

00:24:59.080 --> 00:25:02.440 align:middle line:84%
And the video lasts
almost 15 minutes.

00:25:02.440 --> 00:25:04.550 align:middle line:84%
We have all the evidence
which speaks for itself.

00:25:04.550 --> 00:25:07.240 align:middle line:90%


00:25:07.240 --> 00:25:08.380 align:middle line:90%

00:25:19.360 --> 00:25:20.750 align:middle line:90%

to deal seriously

with the theme of the extra
terrestrial phenomenon.

00:25:40.610 --> 00:25:44.150 align:middle line:84%
And even once they had the nerve
to show this video of a horse

00:25:44.150 --> 00:25:50.840 align:middle line:84%
on one of those shows, the
satire, the prank shows.

00:25:50.840 --> 00:25:53.240 align:middle line:84%
The problem continued when
we then appeared twice

in regular programs.

00:25:56.180 --> 00:26:00.500 align:middle line:84%
They said that he
was not a real horse.

00:26:00.500 --> 00:26:04.130 align:middle line:84%
I filmed it and they
do not believe me.

00:26:04.130 --> 00:26:07.610 align:middle line:84%
They insisted that it
was a simple balloon

00:26:07.610 --> 00:26:11.660 align:middle line:84%
even though they did not
make any kind of analysis.

00:26:11.660 --> 00:26:13.790 align:middle line:84%

consider it absurd

00:26:23.090 --> 00:26:28.250 align:middle line:84%
by those dumb
programs, and that's

00:26:28.250 --> 00:26:31.850 align:middle line:84%
why they mock the
phenomenon of strange UFOs

00:26:31.850 --> 00:26:36.500 align:middle line:84%
without real evidence and say
that a flying horse does not

00:26:36.500 --> 00:26:38.040 align:middle line:90%
exist.

00:26:38.040 --> 00:26:40.820 align:middle line:90%
>> So we decided to make a test.

00:26:40.820 --> 00:26:43.370 align:middle line:84%
The first thing was to try
to find a balloon shaped

00:26:43.370 --> 00:26:46.070 align:middle line:84%
like a horse and release
it in the same place

00:26:46.070 --> 00:26:48.410 align:middle line:84%
where the filmed
horse had been seen.

00:26:48.410 --> 00:26:51.050 align:middle line:84%
We recorded an interview
with Jaime Maussan

00:26:51.050 --> 00:26:52.910 align:middle line:90%
from Mexican television.

00:26:52.910 --> 00:26:55.820 align:middle line:10%
He had directed the test
and made the analysis

00:26:55.820 --> 00:26:57.970 align:middle line:10%
with the following
considerations.

00:26:57.970 --> 00:28:19.600 align:middle line:10%
>> [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

00:28:19.600 --> 00:28:24.220 align:middle line:84%
>> On May 11, 2007, the
test was carried out.

00:28:24.220 --> 00:28:26.350 align:middle line:84%
To do this, we had
to travel again

00:28:26.350 --> 00:28:29.110 align:middle line:90%
to Cinisello Balsamo in Milan.

00:28:29.110 --> 00:28:31.855 align:middle line:84%
There, we did the test
using several cameras.

00:28:31.855 --> 00:28:38.336 align:middle line:90%


00:28:38.336 --> 00:28:40.920 align:middle line:10%
>> [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

00:28:40.920 --> 00:29:55.730 align:middle line:90%


00:29:55.730 --> 00:29:58.430 align:middle line:10%
>> Perhaps the most critical
evidence that would prove

00:29:58.430 --> 00:30:01.910 align:middle line:10%
the authenticity of this
case is this mural that is

00:30:01.910 --> 00:30:06.290 align:middle line:10%
in the Vatican Museum in the
Chapel of San Pedro Mártir

00:30:06.290 --> 00:30:08.900 align:middle line:10%
where some of the miracles
of Peter of Verona are

00:30:08.900 --> 00:30:10.520 align:middle line:10%
represented.

00:30:10.520 --> 00:30:16.400 align:middle line:84%
Pedro was born in 1205 and
was killed on April 6, 1252.

00:30:16.400 --> 00:30:19.340 align:middle line:84%
He was canonized 11
months after his death

00:30:19.340 --> 00:30:22.190 align:middle line:90%
due to his innumerable miracles.

00:30:22.190 --> 00:30:25.910 align:middle line:84%
This would change the name of
Peter of Verona to that of San

00:30:25.910 --> 00:30:28.250 align:middle line:90%
Pedro Mártir.

00:30:28.250 --> 00:30:30.470 align:middle line:84%
On one of its walls,
there is a mural

00:30:30.470 --> 00:30:32.780 align:middle line:84%
where you can clearly
see a group of people

00:30:32.780 --> 00:30:36.110 align:middle line:84%
before whom Peter of
Verona is preaching.

00:30:36.110 --> 00:30:38.240 align:middle line:90%
Observe the image carefully.

00:30:38.240 --> 00:30:42.450 align:middle line:84%
The place is the Plaza de la
Santa Trinidad in Florence

00:30:42.450 --> 00:30:44.150 align:middle line:84%
where this Saint
used to give sermons

00:30:44.150 --> 00:30:47.600 align:middle line:84%
to the faithful who gathered
in significant numbers.

00:30:47.600 --> 00:30:50.990 align:middle line:84%
The Column of Justice, which
is located in that place,

00:30:50.990 --> 00:30:53.090 align:middle line:90%
can be clearly identified.

00:30:53.090 --> 00:30:56.340 align:middle line:84%
The preacher appears with
an oriole around his head

00:30:56.340 --> 00:30:58.550 align:middle line:90%
which represents his holiness.

00:30:58.550 --> 00:31:01.400 align:middle line:84%
It appears that Pedro
is looking up at the sky

00:31:01.400 --> 00:31:04.370 align:middle line:84%
and seems to point to
the horse that flies.

00:31:04.370 --> 00:31:05.990 align:middle line:84%
More than half of
the worshippers

00:31:05.990 --> 00:31:08.300 align:middle line:84%
direct their eyes
towards the sky

00:31:08.300 --> 00:31:10.820 align:middle line:84%
where they see before
them what was probably

00:31:10.820 --> 00:31:12.065 align:middle line:90%
considered a miracle.

00:31:12.065 --> 00:31:14.600 align:middle line:90%


00:31:14.600 --> 00:31:17.750 align:middle line:84%
This mural seems to
represent a real fact.

00:31:17.750 --> 00:31:21.440 align:middle line:10%
Its characteristics are not
those of a figurative painting

00:31:21.440 --> 00:31:24.380 align:middle line:10%
but instead of an
event that happened.

00:31:24.380 --> 00:31:26.900 align:middle line:84%
Even the horse opens
its mouth indicating

00:31:26.900 --> 00:31:28.820 align:middle line:90%
that it was a living animal.

00:31:28.820 --> 00:31:31.400 align:middle line:84%
Why would an artist
represent such an event

00:31:31.400 --> 00:31:34.430 align:middle line:84%
embodied on one of the
walls of the Vatican Museum

00:31:34.430 --> 00:31:36.470 align:middle line:90%
if it were not real?

00:31:36.470 --> 00:31:38.120 align:middle line:84%
It would seem that
this is evidence

00:31:38.120 --> 00:31:41.480 align:middle line:84%
that shows that these
events have happened before

00:31:41.480 --> 00:31:44.450 align:middle line:84%
and for which there is
no real explanation.

00:31:44.450 --> 00:31:48.650 align:middle line:90%


00:31:48.650 --> 00:31:50.620 align:middle line:10%
There are two more
representations

00:31:50.620 --> 00:31:52.690 align:middle line:10%
of the event of the
horse that flies

00:31:52.690 --> 00:31:57.130 align:middle line:10%
over a crowd in the Plaza de
la Santa Trinidad in Florence.

00:31:57.130 --> 00:32:00.190 align:middle line:10%
This is a painting that
is in the Davanzati Palace

00:32:00.190 --> 00:32:04.780 align:middle line:10%
Museum in Florence by the
author Maestro de Marathi who

00:32:04.780 --> 00:32:10.570 align:middle line:10%
produced his works
between 1480 and 1513.

00:32:10.570 --> 00:32:14.710 align:middle line:84%
This seems to represent a real
event and not an allegory.

00:32:14.710 --> 00:32:18.520 align:middle line:84%
Here, we can observe again
some Pedro Mártir preaching

00:32:18.520 --> 00:32:22.300 align:middle line:84%
and clearly see the horse above
the crowd while watching him

00:32:22.300 --> 00:32:23.750 align:middle line:90%
flying over their heads.

00:32:23.750 --> 00:32:29.410 align:middle line:90%


00:32:29.410 --> 00:32:32.410 align:middle line:84%
The third representation
is a Fresco painted

00:32:32.410 --> 00:32:35.410 align:middle line:90%
by Franchi Rosello di Jacopo.

00:32:35.410 --> 00:32:36.790 align:middle line:90%
This image is older.

00:32:36.790 --> 00:32:39.490 align:middle line:90%
It was made in 1445.

00:32:39.490 --> 00:32:42.520 align:middle line:84%
It is shown on a wall in
the lodge of the Bigallo

00:32:42.520 --> 00:32:46.210 align:middle line:84%
in Florence indicating an
event that greatly affected

00:32:46.210 --> 00:32:47.455 align:middle line:90%
the inhabitants of Florence.

00:32:47.455 --> 00:32:50.480 align:middle line:90%


00:32:50.480 --> 00:32:53.720 align:middle line:84%
They must have considered
Peter of Verona a true Saint

00:32:53.720 --> 00:32:57.260 align:middle line:84%
when observing a horse that
flew low over their heads.

00:32:57.260 --> 00:32:59.840 align:middle line:84%
This undoubtedly
influenced them so much

00:32:59.840 --> 00:33:02.690 align:middle line:84%
that this man was
considered a Saint only 11

00:33:02.690 --> 00:33:04.370 align:middle line:90%
months after being killed.

00:33:04.370 --> 00:33:08.470 align:middle line:90%


00:33:08.470 --> 00:33:12.160 align:middle line:84%
Today, Antonio Urzi is
ridiculed for insisting

00:33:12.160 --> 00:33:15.490 align:middle line:84%
that his recording is
that of a live horse.

00:33:15.490 --> 00:33:17.470 align:middle line:84%
History shows us
that these events

00:33:17.470 --> 00:33:19.330 align:middle line:90%
have happened before in Italy.

00:33:19.330 --> 00:33:24.030 align:middle line:90%


00:33:24.030 --> 00:33:27.060 align:middle line:84%
At the conclusion of this
part of the investigation,

00:33:27.060 --> 00:33:30.600 align:middle line:84%
it is obvious that the
dedication of Antonio Urzi

00:33:30.600 --> 00:33:34.500 align:middle line:84%
has presented some of the
best evidence of all time.

00:33:34.500 --> 00:33:36.870 align:middle line:84%
These images are
available to anyone

00:33:36.870 --> 00:33:38.580 align:middle line:90%
who wants to analyze them.

00:33:38.580 --> 00:33:41.280 align:middle line:84%
They constitute the
proof that demonstrates

00:33:41.280 --> 00:33:42.625 align:middle line:90%
this extraordinary case.

00:33:42.625 --> 00:33:46.450 align:middle line:90%


00:33:46.450 --> 00:33:48.880 align:middle line:84%
>> Can a horse fly
through the heavens?

00:33:48.880 --> 00:33:50.880 align:middle line:90%
Logic tells us no.

00:33:50.880 --> 00:33:52.910 align:middle line:84%
But the evidence that
we have presented

00:33:52.910 --> 00:33:56.710 align:middle line:84%
affirms that, yes,
including the paintings

00:33:56.710 --> 00:33:59.470 align:middle line:84%
that we can see in
Florence and also

00:33:59.470 --> 00:34:01.840 align:middle line:90%
in the Museum of the Vatican.

00:34:01.840 --> 00:34:05.050 align:middle line:84%
All of them now
constitute a valid proof

00:34:05.050 --> 00:34:07.090 align:middle line:90%
that we are facing a real fact.

00:34:07.090 --> 00:34:11.600 align:middle line:84%
