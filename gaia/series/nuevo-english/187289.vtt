close to this man

I checked if it was possibly
the iridium satellite,

but it is not.

00:05:29.420 --> 00:05:33.200 align:middle line:84%
Objectively, I would say
that it moved very slowly.

00:05:33.200 --> 00:05:36.410 align:middle line:84%
Besides, we're not within the
coordinates for that satellite,

00:05:36.410 --> 00:05:38.960 align:middle line:90%
which passes over the city.

00:05:38.960 --> 00:05:41.830 align:middle line:84%

>> Yes, and it's
moving too slow.

00:05:45.380 --> 00:05:48.380 align:middle line:84%

high to be a balloon.

It's very unstable.

00:07:32.668 --> 00:07:34.710 align:middle line:84%
Although with some pauses,

00:08:38.280 --> 00:08:39.080 align:middle line:90%
Bye.

00:08:39.080 --> 00:08:44.970 align:middle line:90%


00:08:44.970 --> 00:08:48.450 align:middle line:84%
>> Antonio presents here some
of the most important videos

00:08:48.450 --> 00:08:49.770 align:middle line:90%
for him.

00:08:49.770 --> 00:08:51.435 align:middle line:84%
It is interesting to
hear his comments.

00:08:51.435 --> 00:08:54.780 align:middle line:90%


00:08:54.780 --> 00:08:58.950 align:middle line:84%
>> This case occurred within
a two-week period which began

00:08:58.950 --> 00:09:02.250 align:middle line:90%
on June 4, 2004.

00:09:02.250 --> 00:09:07.830 align:middle line:84%
And here we see scenes
from June 17, 2004,

00:09:07.830 --> 00:09:09.585 align:middle line:90%
which are very interesting.

00:09:09.585 --> 00:09:13.650 align:middle line:90%


00:09:13.650 --> 00:09:18.300 align:middle line:84%
Although the image is
not of excellent quality,

00:09:18.300 --> 00:09:22.860 align:middle line:84%
we can see well the
reflection of the sun

00:09:22.860 --> 00:09:26.310 align:middle line:84%
because the UFO is
positioned in front of it.

00:09:26.310 --> 00:09:28.470 align:middle line:84%
For me, this is
very, very important

00:09:28.470 --> 00:09:31.890 align:middle line:84%
because it can be verified
using the analysis, which

00:09:31.890 --> 00:09:37.430 align:middle line:84%
shows it has an elongated
object, and it is not small.

00:09:37.430 --> 00:09:41.180 align:middle line:84%
>> The test showed the size,
which is important since it is

00:09:41.180 --> 00:09:44.120 align:middle line:84%
complicated for someone to
manipulate an object more than

00:09:44.120 --> 00:09:45.395 align:middle line:90%
100 feet in diameter.

00:09:45.395 --> 00:09:49.370 align:middle line:90%


00:09:49.370 --> 00:09:52.390 align:middle line:84%
>> Many people kept
saying this is all fake,

00:09:52.390 --> 00:09:57.800 align:middle line:84%
that they are miniature
models, that it is a deception.

00:09:57.800 --> 00:10:00.020 align:middle line:90%
It's not like that.

00:10:00.020 --> 00:10:03.720 align:middle line:84%
To prove this, we have critical
elements, such as this data,

00:10:03.720 --> 00:10:06.260 align:middle line:84%
including images and
laboratory analysis.

00:10:06.260 --> 00:10:08.900 align:middle line:90%


00:10:08.900 --> 00:10:12.560 align:middle line:84%
Those tests will then confirm
that it is a massive object

00:10:12.560 --> 00:10:13.625 align:middle line:90%
and that it is not small.

00:10:13.625 --> 00:10:18.110 align:middle line:90%


00:10:18.110 --> 00:10:24.110 align:middle line:84%
>> Some of the UFOs
measure only 15 or 20 feet.

00:10:24.110 --> 00:10:28.580 align:middle line:84%
>> In this case, the UFO has
a maximum size of 20 feet.

00:10:28.580 --> 00:10:32.600 align:middle line:90%


00:10:32.600 --> 00:10:35.510 align:middle line:90%
It's really not a small object.

00:10:35.510 --> 00:10:37.715 align:middle line:84%
Here we can see a
fascinating detail.

00:10:37.715 --> 00:10:41.900 align:middle line:90%


00:10:41.900 --> 00:10:48.320 align:middle line:10%
I had the window open
because many times

00:10:48.320 --> 00:10:50.480 align:middle line:10%
some people have
said that I filmed

00:10:50.480 --> 00:10:54.830 align:middle line:10%
a button attached to the glass.

00:10:54.830 --> 00:10:56.660 align:middle line:10%
But do not be fooled.

00:10:56.660 --> 00:10:58.370 align:middle line:10%
We have many
minutes in the video

00:10:58.370 --> 00:11:01.730 align:middle line:10%
where you can see that the
window is open and not closed.

00:11:01.730 --> 00:11:04.750 align:middle line:90%


00:11:04.750 --> 00:11:07.370 align:middle line:84%
That's why I ask people to think
and pay attention to details.

00:11:07.370 --> 00:11:11.630 align:middle line:90%


00:11:11.630 --> 00:11:15.950 align:middle line:84%
In this example, we see the
UFO starting to disappear.

00:11:15.950 --> 00:11:17.750 align:middle line:84%
Now, I'm going to
enlarge the image

00:11:17.750 --> 00:11:19.400 align:middle line:90%
and you can see the window open.

00:11:19.400 --> 00:11:32.670 align:middle line:90%


00:11:32.670 --> 00:11:34.720 align:middle line:84%
We can notice the
clouds are moving,

00:11:34.720 --> 00:11:38.920 align:middle line:84%
and they move just
like the object.

00:11:38.920 --> 00:11:41.220 align:middle line:84%
It's something
beautiful and fantastic.

00:11:41.220 --> 00:11:49.020 align:middle line:90%


00:11:49.020 --> 00:11:52.950 align:middle line:84%
We see that it is a
physically solid structure.

00:11:52.950 --> 00:11:54.680 align:middle line:84%
The window serves
as a reference.

00:11:54.680 --> 00:11:59.130 align:middle line:90%


00:11:59.130 --> 00:12:03.540 align:middle line:84%
And when the UFO leaves the
frame, I use a wide angle,

00:12:03.540 --> 00:12:04.980 align:middle line:90%
and we can see the window open.

00:12:04.980 --> 00:12:08.640 align:middle line:90%


00:12:08.640 --> 00:12:10.800 align:middle line:90%
This cannot be faked.

00:12:10.800 --> 00:12:15.180 align:middle line:84%
If I could create a
deception of this size,

00:12:15.180 --> 00:12:17.850 align:middle line:84%
tomorrow I would be hired in
Hollywood as a special effects

00:12:17.850 --> 00:12:21.630 align:middle line:84%
magician making a lot
of money, because it

00:12:21.630 --> 00:12:23.337 align:middle line:84%
seems that I can
manipulate and deceive

00:12:23.337 --> 00:12:24.420 align:middle line:90%
the people with my videos.

00:12:24.420 --> 00:12:28.260 align:middle line:90%


00:12:28.260 --> 00:12:32.700 align:middle line:84%
>> After the fascinating
videos of June and July 2004,

00:12:32.700 --> 00:12:36.630 align:middle line:84%
in November of that same year
he would record these UFOs

00:12:36.630 --> 00:12:39.150 align:middle line:90%
at night.

00:12:39.150 --> 00:12:42.000 align:middle line:84%
>> In this case, I
will expand the field.

00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:43.620 align:middle line:84%
And you can see the
structure that I

00:12:43.620 --> 00:12:49.890 align:middle line:84%
have in front of my house as
well as the luminous object

00:12:49.890 --> 00:12:51.280 align:middle line:90%
that will later transform.

00:12:51.280 --> 00:12:53.910 align:middle line:90%


00:12:53.910 --> 00:12:55.440 align:middle line:84%
You cannot say
that this is fake--

00:12:55.440 --> 00:12:58.920 align:middle line:84%
a toy, or a button, which many
people say without thinking.

00:12:58.920 --> 00:13:10.350 align:middle line:90%


00:13:10.350 --> 00:13:12.870 align:middle line:10%
This is a solid,
circular object.

00:13:12.870 --> 00:13:16.170 align:middle line:84%
And here we can see this light,
which illuminates the bottom.

00:13:16.170 --> 00:13:22.220 align:middle line:90%


00:13:22.220 --> 00:13:26.150 align:middle line:90%
Here is the violet UFO.

00:13:26.150 --> 00:13:29.390 align:middle line:90%
It is easily visible.

00:13:29.390 --> 00:13:32.880 align:middle line:84%
In this closeup, we
appreciate the violet light

00:13:32.880 --> 00:13:35.895 align:middle line:84%
that perfectly delineates
the figure of the object.

00:13:35.895 --> 00:13:39.270 align:middle line:90%


00:13:39.270 --> 00:13:42.450 align:middle line:84%
On April 29, 2007,
we filmed a ship

00:13:42.450 --> 00:13:47.660 align:middle line:84%
similar to this one
from November 27, 2004.

00:13:47.660 --> 00:13:51.090 align:middle line:84%
Observe the light projected
on the lower part,

00:13:51.090 --> 00:13:55.230 align:middle line:84%
the reflection of the soccer
field over which it flew.

00:13:55.230 --> 00:14:00.040 align:middle line:84%
My opinion is that this UFO
is of extraterrestrial origin.

00:14:00.040 --> 00:14:01.200 align:middle line:90%
This UFO is closer--

00:14:01.200 --> 00:14:04.590 align:middle line:84%
less than 500 meters
from our house.

00:14:04.590 --> 00:14:06.810 align:middle line:84%
These few seconds really
are fascinating due

00:14:06.810 --> 00:14:08.890 align:middle line:84%
to their characteristics
and color.

00:14:08.890 --> 00:14:12.210 align:middle line:84%
And even in the
dark, it can be seen.

00:14:12.210 --> 00:14:15.640 align:middle line:84%
You need to look
at all the details.

00:14:15.640 --> 00:14:21.060 align:middle line:10%
Here is the light
underneath that's reflected

00:14:21.060 --> 00:14:22.140 align:middle line:10%
from the soccer field.

00:14:22.140 --> 00:14:27.780 align:middle line:90%


00:14:27.780 --> 00:14:30.960 align:middle line:84%
In my point of view, this
is extraterrestrial origin.

00:14:30.960 --> 00:14:33.830 align:middle line:90%


00:14:33.830 --> 00:14:37.850 align:middle line:84%
>> On December 3, 2004, he
filmed for the first time

00:14:37.850 --> 00:14:40.640 align:middle line:84%
an object that was visible
on several occasions.

00:14:40.640 --> 00:14:43.250 align:middle line:90%


00:14:43.250 --> 00:14:47.450 align:middle line:90%
>> December 3, 2004.

00:14:47.450 --> 00:14:50.270 align:middle line:10%
Observe its movements.

00:14:50.270 --> 00:14:53.420 align:middle line:10%
It has light on the bottom that
is a reflection of the sports

00:14:53.420 --> 00:14:54.220 align:middle line:10%
field.

00:14:54.220 --> 00:14:59.040 align:middle line:90%


00:14:59.040 --> 00:15:02.460 align:middle line:84%
Making a comparison
with the video of 2007,

00:15:02.460 --> 00:15:04.560 align:middle line:84%
we clearly see that
it's the same UFO.

00:15:04.560 --> 00:15:07.740 align:middle line:90%


00:15:07.740 --> 00:15:12.780 align:middle line:84%
On May 8, 2005, I
managed to shoot

00:15:12.780 --> 00:15:14.130 align:middle line:90%
a completely different ship.

00:15:14.130 --> 00:15:18.570 align:middle line:90%


00:15:18.570 --> 00:15:22.560 align:middle line:84%
We have discovered that these
structures can be transformed

00:15:22.560 --> 00:15:26.530 align:middle line:84%
into luminous objects due
to a change of frequency

00:15:26.530 --> 00:15:27.330 align:middle line:90%
and vibration.

00:15:27.330 --> 00:15:30.510 align:middle line:90%


00:15:30.510 --> 00:15:33.810 align:middle line:84%
In this case, it is
a real flying disk

00:15:33.810 --> 00:15:35.790 align:middle line:90%
in the form of light.

00:15:35.790 --> 00:15:36.780 align:middle line:90%
Watch the video.

00:15:36.780 --> 00:15:51.920 align:middle line:90%


00:15:51.920 --> 00:15:54.840 align:middle line:84%
The strong luminescence
will cause a lens flare

00:15:54.840 --> 00:15:55.770 align:middle line:90%
that affects my lens.

00:15:55.770 --> 00:15:58.960 align:middle line:90%


00:15:58.960 --> 00:16:02.130 align:middle line:10%
It is this light
that we see here.

00:16:02.130 --> 00:16:04.390 align:middle line:10%
The intensity of the
light was immense

00:16:04.390 --> 00:16:08.575 align:middle line:10%
and caused this bright sphere,
which in reality is not.

00:16:08.575 --> 00:16:13.260 align:middle line:90%


00:16:13.260 --> 00:16:17.610 align:middle line:84%
I can assure you having
witnessed this very special UFO

00:16:17.610 --> 00:16:19.530 align:middle line:84%
that this light cannot
be produced on Earth.

00:16:19.530 --> 00:16:24.720 align:middle line:90%


00:16:24.720 --> 00:16:30.870 align:middle line:10%
I have a lot of experience
with these ships, both day

00:16:30.870 --> 00:16:34.890 align:middle line:10%
and night, and the energy
that comes from these devices

00:16:34.890 --> 00:16:39.020 align:middle line:10%
is totally different
from what we know.

00:16:39.020 --> 00:16:41.340 align:middle line:84%
It is not an artificial
light or solar.

00:16:41.340 --> 00:16:44.850 align:middle line:90%


00:16:44.850 --> 00:16:47.010 align:middle line:84%
Now I'm going to
present another video

00:16:47.010 --> 00:16:50.430 align:middle line:90%
from the 1st of July 2006.

00:16:50.430 --> 00:16:53.070 align:middle line:84%
In the early hours
of the morning,

00:16:53.070 --> 00:16:57.750 align:middle line:84%
there appeared a UFO
of the Adamski type

00:16:57.750 --> 00:17:02.750 align:middle line:84%
where the window and
light can be seen

00:17:02.750 --> 00:17:06.960 align:middle line:84%
and a small object,
a sphere, which

00:17:06.960 --> 00:17:09.839 align:middle line:90%
we do not know what it is.

00:17:09.839 --> 00:17:14.040 align:middle line:84%
A few people have only
seen these scenes.

00:17:14.040 --> 00:17:17.680 align:middle line:84%
I have a considerable amount of
material that I have not shown,

00:17:17.680 --> 00:17:19.190 align:middle line:90%
but now you can see them all.

00:17:19.190 --> 00:17:22.359 align:middle line:90%


00:17:22.359 --> 00:17:25.304 align:middle line:84%
Here it looks like it
was a window, a skylight.

00:17:25.304 --> 00:17:32.410 align:middle line:90%


00:17:32.410 --> 00:17:36.940 align:middle line:84%
George Adamski, who was
contacted in the '50s and '60s,

00:17:36.940 --> 00:17:38.740 align:middle line:90%
photographed a bell-shaped ship.

00:17:38.740 --> 00:17:42.430 align:middle line:90%


00:17:42.430 --> 00:17:46.390 align:middle line:90%
Here is an object near the UFO.

00:17:46.390 --> 00:17:52.150 align:middle line:84%
We don't know what it is, even
though the contact sometimes

00:17:52.150 --> 00:17:53.490 align:middle line:90%
has more information.

00:17:53.490 --> 00:18:02.293 align:middle line:90%


00:18:02.293 --> 00:18:03.835 align:middle line:84%
I have had contact
with these beings.

00:18:03.835 --> 00:18:06.460 align:middle line:90%


00:18:06.460 --> 00:18:09.880 align:middle line:84%
I will not talk more about that
because I do not have material

00:18:09.880 --> 00:18:11.125 align:middle line:90%
to show that I made contact.

00:18:11.125 --> 00:18:15.280 align:middle line:90%


00:18:15.280 --> 00:18:20.985 align:middle line:84%
But later, when I have proof,
I will talk about that topic.

00:18:20.985 --> 00:18:26.080 align:middle line:90%


00:18:26.080 --> 00:18:29.750 align:middle line:84%
I think I know a
good bit about this.

00:18:29.750 --> 00:18:32.130 align:middle line:84%
I know where they
are coming from

00:18:32.130 --> 00:18:34.850 align:middle line:84%
and what time they're
going to arrive,

00:18:34.850 --> 00:18:38.770 align:middle line:84%
and I see the message
of those beings.

00:18:38.770 --> 00:18:41.950 align:middle line:84%
>> Then Antonio gave the
testimony of what could be his

00:18:41.950 --> 00:18:43.840 align:middle line:90%
most significant experience.

00:18:43.840 --> 00:18:48.040 align:middle line:90%


00:18:48.040 --> 00:18:50.365 align:middle line:84%
>> These images were captured
with an analog camera.

00:18:50.365 --> 00:18:53.950 align:middle line:90%


00:18:53.950 --> 00:18:57.100 align:middle line:84%
I did not have an HD or a
telephoto to make closeups,

00:18:57.100 --> 00:19:00.270 align:middle line:84%
but it is possible to see
that this is the structure--

00:19:00.270 --> 00:19:03.070 align:middle line:90%


00:19:03.070 --> 00:19:07.180 align:middle line:84%
the silhouette of a being that
carries in her arms a child.

00:19:07.180 --> 00:19:10.570 align:middle line:90%


00:19:10.570 --> 00:19:13.510 align:middle line:10%
Here we have the comparison
made by Giuseppe Garofalo

00:19:13.510 --> 00:19:17.260 align:middle line:10%
at that time where you can
see the outline of this figure

00:19:17.260 --> 00:19:19.870 align:middle line:10%
with a classic iconology
of the Christian church.

00:19:19.870 --> 00:19:24.780 align:middle line:90%


00:19:24.780 --> 00:19:27.250 align:middle line:90%
See the position?

00:19:27.250 --> 00:19:30.670 align:middle line:90%
That's how it moved in the sky.

00:19:30.670 --> 00:19:34.690 align:middle line:84%
We can clearly see that there
are two different figures.

00:19:34.690 --> 00:19:36.340 align:middle line:84%
Something important
about this event

00:19:36.340 --> 00:19:39.730 align:middle line:84%
is that in Italy in December,
the Virgin of Loreto

00:19:39.730 --> 00:19:41.680 align:middle line:90%
is celebrated--

00:19:41.680 --> 00:19:44.920 align:middle line:84%
on December 12, the
Virgin of Guadalupe--

00:19:44.920 --> 00:19:47.960 align:middle line:84%
and on December 8, the
Immaculate Conception.

00:19:47.960 --> 00:19:52.540 align:middle line:90%


00:19:52.540 --> 00:19:55.490 align:middle line:84%
These are significant dates
in the Christian traditions.

00:19:55.490 --> 00:19:59.850 align:middle line:90%


00:19:59.850 --> 00:20:02.470 align:middle line:10%
When Giorgio
Bongiovanni told me,

00:20:02.470 --> 00:20:06.310 align:middle line:10%
"Get ready because the Virgin
is going to give you a signal,"

00:20:06.310 --> 00:20:11.260 align:middle line:10%
I never thought that she would
come to appear before us.

00:20:11.260 --> 00:20:13.600 align:middle line:90%
Fortunately, we have a video.

00:20:13.600 --> 00:20:17.520 align:middle line:84%
We have a date which agrees
with the Christian tradition.

00:20:17.520 --> 00:20:27.530 align:middle line:90%


00:20:27.530 --> 00:20:29.710 align:middle line:84%
And also the excited
witnesses who

00:20:29.710 --> 00:20:31.800 align:middle line:84%
observed this celestial
appearance in the sky.

00:20:31.800 --> 00:20:36.470 align:middle line:90%


00:20:36.470 --> 00:20:46.810 align:middle line:84%
Another critical part is when a
sphere appears near the Virgin,

00:20:46.810 --> 00:20:50.080 align:middle line:84%
for me, it is surely of
extraterrestrial origin.

00:20:50.080 --> 00:20:55.080 align:middle line:90%


00:20:55.080 --> 00:20:58.690 align:middle line:84%
Here we can look at the
arrival of a small sphere that

00:20:58.690 --> 00:21:00.000 align:middle line:90%
is placed to the left.

00:21:00.000 --> 00:21:05.980 align:middle line:90%


00:21:05.980 --> 00:21:12.100 align:middle line:84%
Here you can see it is the
sphere passing near the Virgin.

00:21:12.100 --> 00:21:17.830 align:middle line:90%


00:21:17.830 --> 00:21:23.360 align:middle line:84%
And it is positioned
there for a few minutes.

00:21:23.360 --> 00:21:27.350 align:middle line:84%
>> Next, Antonio presents
another of his favorite videos,

00:21:27.350 --> 00:21:33.800 align:middle line:90%
recorded on April 29, 2007.

00:21:33.800 --> 00:21:37.340 align:middle line:90%
>> This UFO is incredible.

00:21:37.340 --> 00:21:39.800 align:middle line:84%
Who would have imagined
that such an object would

00:21:39.800 --> 00:21:43.630 align:middle line:90%
manifest itself in this way?

00:21:43.630 --> 00:21:45.489 align:middle line:90%
Oh, look how beautiful.

00:21:45.489 --> 00:21:54.330 align:middle line:90%


00:21:54.330 --> 00:21:57.450 align:middle line:90%
We can look at the top.

00:21:57.450 --> 00:22:04.110 align:middle line:84%
We do not know if it is glass,
but it seems transparent.

00:22:04.110 --> 00:22:07.810 align:middle line:84%
Using our imagination, we can
see these beings observing us.

00:22:07.810 --> 00:22:10.860 align:middle line:90%


00:22:10.860 --> 00:22:13.080 align:middle line:84%
We do not know
why, but this ship

00:22:13.080 --> 00:22:16.080 align:middle line:90%
has specific color differences.

00:22:16.080 --> 00:22:18.870 align:middle line:84%
Perhaps it's due
to the time of day,

00:22:18.870 --> 00:22:22.470 align:middle line:84%
due to the reflection
of the light.

00:22:22.470 --> 00:22:26.370 align:middle line:84%
But we can see its
structure well.

00:22:26.370 --> 00:22:29.640 align:middle line:84%
As a reference, we have
clouds and sunlight.

00:22:29.640 --> 00:22:31.830 align:middle line:84%
Garofalo made
analysis on this UFO

00:22:31.830 --> 00:22:37.170 align:middle line:84%
as well as an
Arizona technician,

00:22:37.170 --> 00:22:40.650 align:middle line:84%
and it showed that it is
a big object, not small.

00:22:40.650 --> 00:22:43.770 align:middle line:84%
I felt pleased when they
explained it to me in detail.

00:22:43.770 --> 00:22:49.070 align:middle line:90%
This happened in 2007.

00:22:49.070 --> 00:22:53.570 align:middle line:84%
>> On December 3, Antonio filmed
another UFO that he considers

00:22:53.570 --> 00:22:56.580 align:middle line:90%
close to his heart.

00:22:56.580 --> 00:23:01.100 align:middle line:84%
>> This is a shocking video
which only lasts a few seconds,

00:23:01.100 --> 00:23:03.330 align:middle line:84%
but it's very important
for all its dynamics.

00:23:03.330 --> 00:23:06.930 align:middle line:90%


00:23:06.930 --> 00:23:08.930 align:middle line:84%
We have the building
as a reference.

00:23:08.930 --> 00:23:12.330 align:middle line:90%


00:23:12.330 --> 00:23:17.250 align:middle line:84%
I calculate that the object
measures maximum 20 feet.

00:23:17.250 --> 00:23:19.800 align:middle line:84%
The light that is reflected
is from the building

00:23:19.800 --> 00:23:20.730 align:middle line:90%
we see on the screen.

00:23:20.730 --> 00:23:23.375 align:middle line:90%


00:23:23.375 --> 00:23:24.250 align:middle line:90%
There's the building.

00:23:24.250 --> 00:23:28.360 align:middle line:90%


00:23:28.360 --> 00:23:31.350 align:middle line:90%
Observe its shape.

00:23:31.350 --> 00:23:34.740 align:middle line:84%
When I tried to zoom in with
a telephoto, the ship left.

00:23:34.740 --> 00:23:38.310 align:middle line:90%


00:23:38.310 --> 00:23:40.755 align:middle line:84%
This is a small, black
sphere that followed the UFO.

00:23:40.755 --> 00:23:44.790 align:middle line:90%


00:23:44.790 --> 00:23:46.030 align:middle line:90%
The building is greenish.

00:23:46.030 --> 00:23:49.170 align:middle line:84%
And the wonderful thing is to
be able to admire the shape

00:23:49.170 --> 00:23:55.320 align:middle line:84%
and contours of this object,
of which we do not yet

00:23:55.320 --> 00:23:56.415 align:middle line:90%
know its true origin.

00:23:56.415 --> 00:24:05.030 align:middle line:90%


00:24:05.030 --> 00:24:08.040 align:middle line:84%
We have another very
interesting UFO,

00:24:08.040 --> 00:24:12.000 align:middle line:84%
and with it we remember the
objects that Adamski saw,

00:24:12.000 --> 00:24:14.600 align:middle line:84%
which were all in the
shape of a bell at the top.

00:24:14.600 --> 00:24:20.090 align:middle line:90%


00:24:20.090 --> 00:24:24.180 align:middle line:84%
But before I clarify
that, many people

00:24:24.180 --> 00:24:28.320 align:middle line:84%
insist that what I
film is not uncommon

00:24:28.320 --> 00:24:30.260 align:middle line:84%
and that it is
from the military.

00:24:30.260 --> 00:24:33.720 align:middle line:90%


00:24:33.720 --> 00:24:38.130 align:middle line:90%
And I ask them, why military?

00:24:38.130 --> 00:24:42.390 align:middle line:84%
Why did they come looking
for me since I was a child?

00:24:42.390 --> 00:24:45.470 align:middle line:84%
With that, the theory of
military gadgets is over.

00:24:45.470 --> 00:24:48.510 align:middle line:90%


00:24:48.510 --> 00:24:51.660 align:middle line:84%
Now let's see the video that
I told you about before.

00:24:51.660 --> 00:24:54.180 align:middle line:84%
We have references,
like, for example, you

00:24:54.180 --> 00:24:56.280 align:middle line:84%
see that the window
is not closed

00:24:56.280 --> 00:25:01.770 align:middle line:84%
but open and corroborates
when I move away.

00:25:01.770 --> 00:25:11.970 align:middle line:84%
And You can clearly see
the window, the frame,

00:25:11.970 --> 00:25:13.620 align:middle line:90%
and the UFO that flies away.

00:25:13.620 --> 00:25:17.760 align:middle line:90%


00:25:17.760 --> 00:25:19.470 align:middle line:84%
Here you have as a
reference the frame

00:25:19.470 --> 00:25:21.140 align:middle line:90%
of the window, which is open.

00:25:21.140 --> 00:25:27.010 align:middle line:90%


00:25:27.010 --> 00:25:30.070 align:middle line:10%
I believe that this object
measured maximum 20 feet.

00:25:30.070 --> 00:25:35.920 align:middle line:90%


00:25:35.920 --> 00:25:36.940 align:middle line:10%
It was incredible.

00:25:36.940 --> 00:25:40.400 align:middle line:90%


00:25:40.400 --> 00:25:44.570 align:middle line:84%
>> Now Antonio describes the
extraordinary video capture

00:25:44.570 --> 00:25:49.550 align:middle line:84%
on December 22, 2012, the
day that marked the end

00:25:49.550 --> 00:25:53.813 align:middle line:84%
of the Mayan calendar and also
the beginning of a new era.

00:25:53.813 --> 00:25:56.230 align:middle line:84%
>> All the people said that
the end of the world was going

00:25:56.230 --> 00:26:00.890 align:middle line:84%
to happen, but
it's not like that.

00:26:00.890 --> 00:26:03.240 align:middle line:90%
It is a generational change.

00:26:03.240 --> 00:26:06.680 align:middle line:84%
And that was when
this UFO appeared.

00:26:06.680 --> 00:26:09.920 align:middle line:84%
In the middle of the
sky was a black dot.

00:26:09.920 --> 00:26:13.010 align:middle line:90%
I thought it was a UFO.

00:26:13.010 --> 00:26:16.640 align:middle line:84%
I focused on it with
more magnification.

00:26:16.640 --> 00:26:19.310 align:middle line:84%
And then we see the
structure of an object

00:26:19.310 --> 00:26:23.480 align:middle line:84%
in the shape of a rhomboid,
which in 2011 and 2013

00:26:23.480 --> 00:26:26.390 align:middle line:84%
appeared in Mexico in a
shocking video showing

00:26:26.390 --> 00:26:28.560 align:middle line:90%
a similar structure.

00:26:28.560 --> 00:26:29.360 align:middle line:90%
Here you have it.

00:26:29.360 --> 00:26:38.660 align:middle line:90%


00:26:38.660 --> 00:26:42.375 align:middle line:10%
Here is a sphere, which is
always close to the UFO.

00:26:42.375 --> 00:26:45.450 align:middle line:90%


00:26:45.450 --> 00:26:49.170 align:middle line:10%
We can see the
structure in detail.

00:26:49.170 --> 00:26:53.160 align:middle line:84%
The lower part is dark,
and, according to Garofalo,

00:26:53.160 --> 00:26:56.730 align:middle line:84%
the upper part seems to
have different dimensions

00:26:56.730 --> 00:26:58.160 align:middle line:90%
and is transparent.

00:26:58.160 --> 00:27:01.950 align:middle line:90%


00:27:01.950 --> 00:27:05.160 align:middle line:90%
It is a fascinating video.

00:27:05.160 --> 00:27:06.660 align:middle line:90%
Very, very interesting.

00:27:06.660 --> 00:27:09.650 align:middle line:90%


00:27:09.650 --> 00:27:13.190 align:middle line:84%
>> He recorded another
exceptional video on August 30

00:27:13.190 --> 00:27:15.110 align:middle line:90%
of 2013.

00:27:15.110 --> 00:27:16.145 align:middle line:90%
These were his comments.

00:27:16.145 --> 00:27:19.580 align:middle line:90%


00:27:19.580 --> 00:27:23.870 align:middle line:84%
>> On August 30, 2013,
exactly eight months apart,

00:27:23.870 --> 00:27:27.880 align:middle line:84%
in front of my house
appeared an elongated UFO,

00:27:27.880 --> 00:27:29.940 align:middle line:90%
a metallic silver structure.

00:27:29.940 --> 00:27:34.370 align:middle line:90%


00:27:34.370 --> 00:27:36.740 align:middle line:10%
We have a building
as a reference.

00:27:36.740 --> 00:27:40.820 align:middle line:10%
And that day I was on the
phone with Giorgio Caria.

00:27:40.820 --> 00:27:44.480 align:middle line:10%
I managed to film some
closeups, and in that way,

00:27:44.480 --> 00:27:46.220 align:middle line:10%
I observed the object
in great detail.

00:27:46.220 --> 00:27:49.002 align:middle line:90%


00:27:49.002 --> 00:27:50.960 align:middle line:84%
It would seem that it
had a hole in the bottom.

00:27:50.960 --> 00:27:57.100 align:middle line:90%


00:27:57.100 --> 00:27:58.940 align:middle line:84%
The final analysis
showed that it is

00:27:58.940 --> 00:28:00.930 align:middle line:90%
a large object and not small.

00:28:00.930 --> 00:28:04.540 align:middle line:90%


00:28:04.540 --> 00:28:08.880 align:middle line:84%
The reflection of the sun
was taken into consideration.

00:28:08.880 --> 00:28:12.590 align:middle line:84%
And because of its
position, the object

00:28:12.590 --> 00:28:16.040 align:middle line:84%
was flying over
my house, and here

00:28:16.040 --> 00:28:17.480 align:middle line:90%
are these scenes that show it.

00:28:17.480 --> 00:28:20.330 align:middle line:90%


00:28:20.330 --> 00:28:25.140 align:middle line:84%
>> On April 15, 2015, he would
record one of his last videos

00:28:25.140 --> 00:28:25.940 align:middle line:90%
of that year.

00:28:25.940 --> 00:28:32.990 align:middle line:90%


00:28:32.990 --> 00:28:36.170 align:middle line:84%
>> In this case, we have
as a reference the trees,

00:28:36.170 --> 00:28:39.640 align:middle line:84%
and that beautiful UFO
with a flashing gold color.

00:28:39.640 --> 00:28:42.290 align:middle line:90%


00:28:42.290 --> 00:28:46.970 align:middle line:84%
We do not know more
details of this object,

00:28:46.970 --> 00:28:49.490 align:middle line:84%
but we can deduce that
it is a spaceship flying

00:28:49.490 --> 00:28:51.205 align:middle line:90%
in the sky of Cinisello Balsamo.

00:28:51.205 --> 00:29:05.890 align:middle line:90%


00:29:05.890 --> 00:29:08.700 align:middle line:90%
The object is striking.

00:29:08.700 --> 00:29:12.130 align:middle line:84%
We see the sun, which
illuminates the UFO.

00:29:12.130 --> 00:29:16.120 align:middle line:90%


00:29:16.120 --> 00:29:18.070 align:middle line:90%
It was a pleasant afternoon.

00:29:18.070 --> 00:29:20.380 align:middle line:84%
I spent more than five
hours waiting in the forest

00:29:20.380 --> 00:29:21.625 align:middle line:90%
for the UFO to appear.

00:29:21.625 --> 00:29:27.590 align:middle line:90%


00:29:27.590 --> 00:29:30.410 align:middle line:84%
I had everything ready to film
the encounter that I was sure

00:29:30.410 --> 00:29:34.340 align:middle line:84%
was going to happen, but
it seemed that everything

00:29:34.340 --> 00:29:35.440 align:middle line:90%
was going to be in vain.

00:29:35.440 --> 00:29:39.020 align:middle line:90%


00:29:39.020 --> 00:29:40.940 align:middle line:84%
My wife, Simona,
called me to dinner

00:29:40.940 --> 00:29:44.240 align:middle line:90%
because it was already late.

00:29:44.240 --> 00:29:47.020 align:middle line:84%
It was almost 8
o'clock at night.

00:29:47.020 --> 00:29:50.660 align:middle line:84%
I had been there since 3 o'clock
in the afternoon in the forest.

00:29:50.660 --> 00:29:54.380 align:middle line:84%
And at the moment I was packing
the photography equipment,

00:29:54.380 --> 00:29:57.130 align:middle line:90%
this incredible ship appeared.

00:29:57.130 --> 00:30:00.260 align:middle line:84%
>> It would be three years
before Antonio filmed another

00:30:00.260 --> 00:30:03.320 align:middle line:90%
UFO again.

00:30:03.320 --> 00:30:06.800 align:middle line:90%
It happened on April 17, 2018.

00:30:06.800 --> 00:30:10.970 align:middle line:84%
The fact was also announced
by Giorgio Bongiovanni.

00:30:10.970 --> 00:30:13.430 align:middle line:84%
>> Here we have memorable
scenes of a real ship

00:30:13.430 --> 00:30:14.850 align:middle line:90%
of extraterrestrial origin.

00:30:14.850 --> 00:30:18.140 align:middle line:90%


00:30:18.140 --> 00:30:22.340 align:middle line:84%
I assure you that they
filled me with emotion.

00:30:22.340 --> 00:30:23.780 align:middle line:84%
I hope people
really get motivated

00:30:23.780 --> 00:30:24.905 align:middle line:90%
when they see these scenes.

00:30:24.905 --> 00:30:29.270 align:middle line:90%


00:30:29.270 --> 00:30:33.250 align:middle line:84%
I saw the ship because Giorgio
Bongiovanni, who was a mystic,

00:30:33.250 --> 00:30:36.410 align:middle line:84%
called me a week earlier and
said, "Antonio, get ready

00:30:36.410 --> 00:30:39.420 align:middle line:84%
because the next UFO will
be a gold-colored ship."

00:30:39.420 --> 00:30:44.380 align:middle line:90%


00:30:44.380 --> 00:30:45.700 align:middle line:90%
Here are the results--

00:30:45.700 --> 00:30:49.040 align:middle line:90%
a fantastic UFO.

00:30:49.040 --> 00:30:52.210 align:middle line:90%
It was a terrific day.

00:30:52.210 --> 00:30:55.530 align:middle line:84%
And then the UFO appeared
in size very large,

00:30:55.530 --> 00:30:57.040 align:middle line:90%
and the color is natural.

00:30:57.040 --> 00:30:59.990 align:middle line:90%


00:30:59.990 --> 00:31:00.790 align:middle line:90%
There's no trick.

00:31:00.790 --> 00:31:04.750 align:middle line:90%
It merely reflects the sunset.

00:31:04.750 --> 00:31:07.810 align:middle line:84%
Again, having witnessed
this, I assure you

00:31:07.810 --> 00:31:09.290 align:middle line:84%
that all this
happened like that.

00:31:09.290 --> 00:31:16.540 align:middle line:90%


00:31:16.540 --> 00:31:19.170 align:middle line:90%
It's just beautiful.

00:31:19.170 --> 00:31:21.130 align:middle line:84%
You can really appreciate
the whole structure.

00:31:21.130 --> 00:31:26.530 align:middle line:90%


00:31:26.530 --> 00:31:31.330 align:middle line:84%
This is the last ship I filmed
in this period on April 17,

00:31:31.330 --> 00:31:40.690 align:middle line:90%
2018.

00:31:40.690 --> 00:31:43.030 align:middle line:84%
It is this first
sighting of the year,

00:31:43.030 --> 00:31:46.360 align:middle line:84%
and after three years,
the most important thing

00:31:46.360 --> 00:31:48.880 align:middle line:84%
I can present to the
world as evidence.

00:31:48.880 --> 00:31:53.650 align:middle line:90%


00:31:53.650 --> 00:31:56.290 align:middle line:84%
The most important
thing I can present

00:31:56.290 --> 00:32:00.170 align:middle line:90%
to the world as evidence.

00:32:00.170 --> 00:32:01.795 align:middle line:84%
I am honored to
receive these visitors.

00:32:01.795 --> 00:32:04.480 align:middle line:90%


00:32:04.480 --> 00:32:09.130 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes I cannot find the
words to express how excited I

00:32:09.130 --> 00:32:12.475 align:middle line:84%
am to be the conduit
for this contact.

00:32:12.475 --> 00:32:17.470 align:middle line:90%


00:32:17.470 --> 00:32:21.250 align:middle line:84%
I believe I am a
bearer of a mission.

00:32:21.250 --> 00:32:24.340 align:middle line:90%
I know it's a mission.

00:32:24.340 --> 00:32:26.050 align:middle line:90%
Those beings told me.

00:32:26.050 --> 00:32:28.440 align:middle line:84%
They confirmed everything
I'm going to do this year.

00:32:28.440 --> 00:32:32.290 align:middle line:90%


00:32:32.290 --> 00:32:34.630 align:middle line:10%
I thank the journalist
Jaime Maussan.

00:32:34.630 --> 00:32:37.960 align:middle line:10%
Because of him, my case
is known more and more.

00:32:37.960 --> 00:32:41.020 align:middle line:10%
Also I thank the researcher
Pier Giorgio Caria

00:32:41.020 --> 00:32:43.410 align:middle line:10%
as well as my great
friend Giuseppe Garofalo.

00:32:43.410 --> 00:32:48.030 align:middle line:90%


00:32:48.030 --> 00:32:52.750 align:middle line:84%
It is a great team, and we do
it with the help of heaven.

00:32:52.750 --> 00:32:56.470 align:middle line:84%
Unfortunately, people
still do not believe.

00:32:56.470 --> 00:32:59.710 align:middle line:84%
They must experience
this for themselves.

00:32:59.710 --> 00:33:02.590 align:middle line:84%
I'm sure that very soon
these beings and their ships

00:33:02.590 --> 00:33:05.380 align:middle line:84%
will appear before
the whole world.

00:33:05.380 --> 00:33:07.420 align:middle line:84%
The problem is that
many people still

00:33:07.420 --> 00:33:11.980 align:middle line:84%
do not understand that
we are being visited

00:33:11.980 --> 00:33:21.280 align:middle line:84%
by another intelligence from
other planets helping us,

00:33:21.280 --> 00:33:28.810 align:middle line:84%
especially those who
love life and truth.

00:33:28.810 --> 00:33:32.830 align:middle line:84%
>> This is the life and
history of Antonio Urzi,

00:33:32.830 --> 00:33:36.250 align:middle line:84%
a talented man who wants to
achieve fame as a fashion

00:33:36.250 --> 00:33:39.670 align:middle line:84%
designer and who has lived
one of the most extraordinary

00:33:39.670 --> 00:33:41.485 align:middle line:90%
experiences in history.

00:33:41.485 --> 00:33:47.140 align:middle line:90%


00:33:47.140 --> 00:33:51.140 align:middle line:84%
>> This is a case out of
the ordinary experience,

00:33:51.140 --> 00:33:55.420 align:middle line:84%
a case that presents
extraordinary evidence.

00:33:55.420 --> 00:33:58.630 align:middle line:84%
This evidence has not
only been investigated

00:33:58.630 --> 00:34:01.640 align:middle line:84%
and its authenticity
demonstrated,

00:34:01.640 --> 00:34:05.710 align:middle line:84%
but it's also available to
professional researchers,

00:34:05.710 --> 00:34:09.130 align:middle line:84%
to computer specialists
who wish to carry out

00:34:09.130 --> 00:34:12.760 align:middle line:84%
their own analysis,
where, very likely,

00:34:12.760 --> 00:34:14.889 align:middle line:84%
they will obtain
the same results.

00:34:14.889 --> 00:34:17.350 align:middle line:84%
In the next episode
of "Nuevo," we

00:34:17.350 --> 00:34:20.199 align:middle line:84%
will present to you
the conclusions.

00:34:20.199 --> 00:34:22.750 align:middle line:84%
I am Jaime Maussan,
and I will see you

00:34:22.750 --> 00:34:25.820 align:middle line:90%
in the next program of "Nuevo."

00:34:25.820 --> 00:34:29.320 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:34:29.320 --> 00:34:34.610 align:middle line:90%


00:34:34.610 --> 00:34:44.290 align:middle line:10%
>> Gaia presented "Nuevo"
with Jaime Maussan.
