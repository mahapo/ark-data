craft that we know crash landed
near Los Alamos in Roswell,

00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:41.420 align:middle line:10%
New Mexico on July 3rd, 1947.

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:43.760 align:middle line:84%
However, recent
investigations have

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:48.200 align:middle line:84%
shown that the first ship
fell just 18 miles from where

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:51.470 align:middle line:84%
the first atomic
bomb was detonated.

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:54.620 align:middle line:84%
30 days after this
happened, the atomic bomb

00:00:54.620 --> 00:00:56.900 align:middle line:90%
was detonated on July 16th.

00:00:56.900 --> 00:01:01.680 align:middle line:84%
And on August 16th, precisely
in New Mexico in San Antonio,

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:05.390 align:middle line:84%
this ship was seen to
crash land with up to four

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:07.460 align:middle line:90%
extraterrestrials inside.

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:09.070 align:middle line:90%
Quite a fantastic story.

>> San Antonio, New Mexico.

00:01:14.720 --> 00:01:19.940 align:middle line:84%
Almost two years before an alien
ship crash landed in Roswell,

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:22.250 align:middle line:84%
a ship with four
occupants came down

00:01:22.250 --> 00:01:25.670 align:middle line:84%
just 18 miles from
that site, and 30 days

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:29.300 align:middle line:84%
after the detonation of
the first atomic bomb test.

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:34.400 align:middle line:10%
A memo from a special agent to
the director of the FBI in 1950

00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:36.440 align:middle line:10%
discovered that there
were three ships that

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:40.010 align:middle line:10%
crashed around the Los
Alamos nuclear power plant

00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:42.500 align:middle line:10%
in New Mexico.

00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:45.680 align:middle line:84%
The documents said that
extraterrestrial beings had

00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:48.650 align:middle line:84%
been recovered, and that the
ships had been brought down

00:01:48.650 --> 00:01:50.840 align:middle line:84%
as a result of the
powerful radars that

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:54.220 align:middle line:90%
operated in the area.

00:01:54.220 --> 00:01:59.200 align:middle line:84%
On August 16, 1945, two
children 6 and 7 years old

00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:02.590 align:middle line:84%
were looking for a cow in the
vicinity of a New Mexico ranch

00:02:02.590 --> 00:02:05.890 align:middle line:84%
just a few miles away
from the Trinity site.

00:02:05.890 --> 00:02:08.590 align:middle line:84%
These children witnessed
the crash landing

00:02:08.590 --> 00:02:12.160 align:middle line:84%
of an oval-shaped ship
that crashed into a tower

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:14.050 align:middle line:90%
and fell to the ground.

00:02:14.050 --> 00:02:17.320 align:middle line:84%
They saw beings with
nonhuman characteristics

00:02:17.320 --> 00:02:20.560 align:middle line:84%
who were barely larger
than themselves.

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:23.080 align:middle line:84%
With binoculars, they
observed the little beings

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:25.960 align:middle line:84%
for almost two
hours, an experience

00:02:25.960 --> 00:02:29.230 align:middle line:90%
that they would never forget.

00:02:29.230 --> 00:02:31.420 align:middle line:84%
Later, the army arrived,
and took the ship

00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:33.770 align:middle line:90%
to an unknown location.

00:02:33.770 --> 00:02:38.020 align:middle line:84%
However, the children, Jose
Padilla, and Reme Baca,

00:02:38.020 --> 00:02:41.830 align:middle line:84%
took a piece of metal from
inside the ship, a piece

00:02:41.830 --> 00:02:44.710 align:middle line:84%
that they have preserved
until this day.

00:02:44.710 --> 00:02:49.510 align:middle line:10%
Journalist Paola Harris was the
first to investigate this case,

00:02:49.510 --> 00:02:53.920 align:middle line:10%
and reached the conclusion
that it was authentic.

00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:57.340 align:middle line:10%
We had the opportunity to talk
with her at the historic Owl

00:02:57.340 --> 00:03:00.100 align:middle line:10%
Bar and Cafe, the
very same place

00:03:00.100 --> 00:03:02.770 align:middle line:10%
those people that participated
in the development

00:03:02.770 --> 00:03:07.370 align:middle line:10%
of the first atomic bomb met,
codenamed Manhattan Project.

00:03:07.370 --> 00:03:09.640 align:middle line:84%
They came to this
bar and cafe to talk

00:03:09.640 --> 00:03:12.836 align:middle line:84%
about these
extraordinary events.

00:03:12.836 --> 00:03:17.590 align:middle line:84%
>> So where did you find
the story of San Antonio?

00:03:17.590 --> 00:03:21.640 align:middle line:84%
Where did you find Jose
Padilla and Reme Baca?

00:03:21.640 --> 00:03:25.240 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, in about 2004,
I was living in Italy,

00:03:25.240 --> 00:03:30.670 align:middle line:84%
and I read a story by Ben
Moffett for the newspaper here

00:03:30.670 --> 00:03:32.290 align:middle line:90%
in San Antonio.

00:03:32.290 --> 00:03:34.170 align:middle line:90%
And I read this story--

00:03:34.170 --> 00:03:38.080 align:middle line:84%
it was on internet-- about two
little Mexican boys that had

00:03:38.080 --> 00:03:40.500 align:middle line:90%
witnessed a crash with beings.

00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:42.680 align:middle line:84%
And when I was in
Italy, I thought, well,

00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:44.980 align:middle line:84%
why isn't somebody
researching this?

00:03:44.980 --> 00:03:50.410 align:middle line:84%
Then years later, I got a tip
from a friend and the telephone

00:03:50.410 --> 00:03:51.670 align:middle line:90%
number of Reme Baca.

00:03:51.670 --> 00:03:53.110 align:middle line:90%
He was one of those little boys.

00:03:53.110 --> 00:03:55.600 align:middle line:84%
I had already read the
Ben Moffett article.

00:03:55.600 --> 00:03:59.620 align:middle line:84%
And Ben Moffett went to
school with Reme and Jose,

00:03:59.620 --> 00:04:02.440 align:middle line:84%
so he knew about this story,
because they had told him.

00:04:02.440 --> 00:04:06.530 align:middle line:84%
So I got a tip, and also
I got the telephone number

00:04:06.530 --> 00:04:09.950 align:middle line:84%
of Reme Baca, who lived
in Gig Harbor, Washington.

00:04:09.950 --> 00:04:13.300 align:middle line:90%
And I called for one solid year.

00:04:13.300 --> 00:04:17.420 align:middle line:10%
I called for one solid year
and made friends with him

00:04:17.420 --> 00:04:18.730 align:middle line:10%
so he would trust me.

00:04:18.730 --> 00:04:21.370 align:middle line:84%
And he began telling
me about this story.

00:04:21.370 --> 00:04:26.320 align:middle line:84%
Then he asked me to speak to
Jose, who was in California.

00:04:26.320 --> 00:04:27.670 align:middle line:90%
And I verified this story.

00:04:27.670 --> 00:04:30.640 align:middle line:84%
Because both men had
the very same story.

00:04:30.640 --> 00:04:34.360 align:middle line:84%
I wrote an article for X Times
in Italy about the story.

00:04:34.360 --> 00:04:35.700 align:middle line:90%
I contacted you.

00:04:35.700 --> 00:04:37.480 align:middle line:90%
I contacted James Fox.

00:04:37.480 --> 00:04:41.790 align:middle line:84%
I contacted Swiss TV,
who went to interview

00:04:41.790 --> 00:04:43.150 align:middle line:90%
Reme Baca in Washington.

00:04:43.150 --> 00:04:46.540 align:middle line:84%
Thank god I did that, because
like Don Schmitt says,

00:04:46.540 --> 00:04:48.010 align:middle line:90%
it's a race with the undertaker.

00:04:48.010 --> 00:04:51.010 align:middle line:84%
Because these people are
dying, and they are witnesses

00:04:51.010 --> 00:04:53.350 align:middle line:90%
to very amazing events.

00:04:53.350 --> 00:04:57.950 align:middle line:84%
So we have on camera, Reme
Baca, who died in June.

00:04:57.950 --> 00:05:02.200 align:middle line:84%
And today you have Jose Padilla,
who actually brought you

00:05:02.200 --> 00:05:03.340 align:middle line:90%
to the site.

00:05:03.340 --> 00:05:06.160 align:middle line:84%
And this is my job
as an investigator.

00:05:06.160 --> 00:05:09.180 align:middle line:84%
I've been working
at it since 2009.

00:05:09.180 --> 00:05:10.600 align:middle line:90%
We're at 2014.

00:05:10.600 --> 00:05:13.270 align:middle line:84%
Five years to work on
this story, which I think

00:05:13.270 --> 00:05:15.580 align:middle line:84%
is one of the most
amazing stories ever.

00:05:15.580 --> 00:05:19.630 align:middle line:84%
Because it connects to the
atomic bomb situation, which

00:05:19.630 --> 00:05:22.360 align:middle line:84%
I think was the
stimulus for a lot

00:05:22.360 --> 00:05:25.360 align:middle line:90%
of the crashes in New Mexico.

00:05:25.360 --> 00:05:29.650 align:middle line:84%
>> We are hearing about where
Robert Oppenheimer used to sit

00:05:29.650 --> 00:05:34.750 align:middle line:84%
and drink and relax and
talk about the bomb.

00:05:34.750 --> 00:05:36.120 align:middle line:90%
And nobody knew about it.

00:05:36.120 --> 00:05:37.235 align:middle line:90%
>> Nobody knew about it.

00:05:37.235 --> 00:05:39.650 align:middle line:84%
>> The bomb was detonated
not very far from here.

00:05:39.650 --> 00:05:41.590 align:middle line:90%
>> No, 18 miles from here.

00:05:41.590 --> 00:05:43.930 align:middle line:90%
And the crash site is behind us.

00:05:43.930 --> 00:05:47.380 align:middle line:84%
It's about maybe
seven or eight miles.

00:05:47.380 --> 00:05:52.700 align:middle line:84%
And it's in the township
of San Antonio, New Mexico.

00:05:52.700 --> 00:05:58.780 align:middle line:84%
So all of these events took
place in August of 1945.

00:05:58.780 --> 00:06:00.130 align:middle line:90%
This bar is very important.

00:06:00.130 --> 00:06:04.757 align:middle line:84%
Because I really believe
that if there was a crash--

00:06:04.757 --> 00:06:06.340 align:middle line:84%
I mean, Oppenheimer
and the scientists

00:06:06.340 --> 00:06:08.058 align:middle line:90%
would have to know about it.

00:06:08.058 --> 00:06:09.850 align:middle line:84%
They would certainly
have to know about it.

00:06:09.850 --> 00:06:11.590 align:middle line:84%
And they may have
even gone on the site.

00:06:11.590 --> 00:06:12.670 align:middle line:90%
Because this was amazing.

00:06:12.670 --> 00:06:14.320 align:middle line:90%
This was news.

00:06:14.320 --> 00:06:16.600 align:middle line:84%
This was something
that affected them.

00:06:16.600 --> 00:06:19.420 align:middle line:10%
So I think that in those
days, the scientists that

00:06:19.420 --> 00:06:22.570 align:middle line:10%
were working on this knew very
well that there were crashes,

00:06:22.570 --> 00:06:27.280 align:middle line:10%
and they were related to either
the high intensity radar that

00:06:27.280 --> 00:06:30.922 align:middle line:10%
brought them down, or some
kind of environmental thing

00:06:30.922 --> 00:06:31.880 align:middle line:10%
that brought them down.

00:06:31.880 --> 00:06:36.700 align:middle line:84%
But the visitations in those
days was around this big event.

00:06:36.700 --> 00:06:40.780 align:middle line:84%
This planet had discovered
the nuclear age.

00:06:40.780 --> 00:06:43.606 align:middle line:90%


00:06:43.606 --> 00:06:49.370 align:middle line:84%
>> And the crash, according to
how it was reported it happened

00:06:49.370 --> 00:06:53.560 align:middle line:84%
when I was 16, just a month
after the atomic bomb was

00:06:53.560 --> 00:06:54.360 align:middle line:90%
detonated.

00:06:54.360 --> 00:06:55.750 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:06:55.750 --> 00:06:57.920 align:middle line:84%
But there are photographs--
and I have some--

00:06:57.920 --> 00:07:02.280 align:middle line:84%
of the men on the Trinity
site with the mushroom

00:07:02.280 --> 00:07:04.650 align:middle line:84%
cloud with UFOs
in the background.

00:07:04.650 --> 00:07:06.390 align:middle line:90%
They have been leaked out.

00:07:06.390 --> 00:07:11.340 align:middle line:84%
So when we did that, it upset
something in the environment,

00:07:11.340 --> 00:07:15.740 align:middle line:84%
or in dimensions, where
it caused this phenomenon.

00:07:15.740 --> 00:07:18.300 align:middle line:84%
And you know that it's
the birth of ufology.

00:07:18.300 --> 00:07:21.150 align:middle line:84%
Roswell is considered
mythologically, the birth

00:07:21.150 --> 00:07:23.310 align:middle line:90%
of the modern UFO era.

00:07:23.310 --> 00:07:25.840 align:middle line:84%
But this is even more
amazing, because it's 1945,

00:07:25.840 --> 00:07:28.716 align:middle line:90%
which is two years before.

00:07:28.716 --> 00:07:32.850 align:middle line:10%
>> Thus the case of the San
Antonio alien incident would

00:07:32.850 --> 00:07:37.770 align:middle line:10%
join the cases that occurred in
Roswell and Aztec, New Mexico.

00:07:37.770 --> 00:07:40.440 align:middle line:84%
All of them were in close
proximity to the place

00:07:40.440 --> 00:07:46.170 align:middle line:84%
where atomic bombs were
detonated between 1945 and '48.

00:07:46.170 --> 00:07:49.080 align:middle line:84%
It's not by chance that
these alien visitors

00:07:49.080 --> 00:07:51.930 align:middle line:84%
had been so interested
in the new technology

00:07:51.930 --> 00:07:54.705 align:middle line:84%
that human beings had
developed for war purposes.

00:07:54.705 --> 00:07:57.560 align:middle line:90%


00:07:57.560 --> 00:08:02.470 align:middle line:84%
>> How far are we
hear from Los Alamos,

00:08:02.470 --> 00:08:07.156 align:middle line:84%
from the Trinity site
where the bomb exploded?

00:08:07.156 --> 00:08:08.900 align:middle line:90%
>> See those bumpy hills there?

00:08:08.900 --> 00:08:09.700 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:08:09.700 --> 00:08:12.180 align:middle line:90%
>> That's Trinity site.

00:08:12.180 --> 00:08:15.310 align:middle line:84%
Over to the left
of there, that's

00:08:15.310 --> 00:08:20.080 align:middle line:84%
where the entrance is
to that Trinity site.

00:08:20.080 --> 00:08:22.960 align:middle line:84%
Well, they used to call
it Stallion site before.

00:08:22.960 --> 00:08:24.970 align:middle line:84%
>> Where is San
Antonio from here?

00:08:24.970 --> 00:08:29.890 align:middle line:84%
>> Our ranch is down on
this gully right here

00:08:29.890 --> 00:08:34.760 align:middle line:84%
to the right-hand
side about four miles.

00:08:34.760 --> 00:08:37.346 align:middle line:84%
>> You were so
close from Trinity.

00:08:37.346 --> 00:08:40.809 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, from where the
bomb was, it's 18 miles.

00:08:40.809 --> 00:08:41.919 align:middle line:90%
>> 18 miles?

00:08:41.919 --> 00:08:44.384 align:middle line:90%
>> 18 miles.

00:08:44.384 --> 00:08:45.670 align:middle line:90%
>> It's too close, isn't it?

00:08:45.670 --> 00:08:50.230 align:middle line:90%


00:08:50.230 --> 00:08:51.930 align:middle line:90%
>> It is too close.

00:08:51.930 --> 00:08:53.820 align:middle line:90%
Because that's when my mother--

00:08:53.820 --> 00:08:56.770 align:middle line:84%
we see when that
bomb exploded there--

00:08:56.770 --> 00:09:00.260 align:middle line:90%


00:09:00.260 --> 00:09:03.740 align:middle line:84%
when she looked out
through to the door at it,

00:09:03.740 --> 00:09:05.120 align:middle line:90%
she got blind from that eye.

00:09:05.120 --> 00:09:07.770 align:middle line:90%


00:09:07.770 --> 00:09:15.090 align:middle line:84%
It took about three minutes for
the wind, hot wind floating up

00:09:15.090 --> 00:09:15.940 align:middle line:90%
this way.

00:09:15.940 --> 00:09:18.548 align:middle line:90%
That was the radiation.

00:09:18.548 --> 00:09:19.955 align:middle line:90%
>> You were hit by it?

00:09:19.955 --> 00:09:23.060 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh yes.

00:09:23.060 --> 00:09:25.980 align:middle line:10%
We felt it, it was
warm, like a warm--

00:09:25.980 --> 00:09:28.900 align:middle line:10%
not this fast, you know?

00:09:28.900 --> 00:09:32.752 align:middle line:10%
But there was like a warm
wind coming through then.

00:09:32.752 --> 00:09:34.320 align:middle line:10%
>> And your mother?

00:09:34.320 --> 00:09:36.810 align:middle line:84%
>> My mother lost the sight
of that eye, you know?

00:09:36.810 --> 00:09:37.990 align:middle line:90%
She was looking at that.

00:09:37.990 --> 00:09:44.790 align:middle line:84%
But she lost it from the
[INAUDIBLE] explosion

00:09:44.790 --> 00:09:46.330 align:middle line:90%
when she [INAUDIBLE].

00:09:46.330 --> 00:09:47.250 align:middle line:90%
>> But you didn't?

00:09:47.250 --> 00:09:48.240 align:middle line:90%
>> Just burned.

00:09:48.240 --> 00:09:51.900 align:middle line:84%
Well, no I jumped
underneath the bed.

00:09:51.900 --> 00:09:54.240 align:middle line:84%
Then about three minutes
later, I came out.

00:09:54.240 --> 00:09:57.870 align:middle line:84%
That's when everything
was kind of silent.

00:09:57.870 --> 00:10:03.030 align:middle line:84%
And we seen an aeroplane
flying over our range

00:10:03.030 --> 00:10:04.267 align:middle line:90%
coming up this way.

00:10:04.267 --> 00:10:05.850 align:middle line:84%
I guess they were
checking out, seeing

00:10:05.850 --> 00:10:09.746 align:middle line:90%
if there was any damage here.

00:10:09.746 --> 00:10:13.520 align:middle line:10%
>> How did you feel then?

00:10:13.520 --> 00:10:25.487 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, I just felt a strong
blow and the light of it.

00:10:25.487 --> 00:10:26.320 align:middle line:90%
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:10:26.320 --> 00:10:29.590 align:middle line:84%
>> Do you think it's a relation
between this UFO and the atomic

00:10:29.590 --> 00:10:31.880 align:middle line:90%
bomb?

00:10:31.880 --> 00:10:36.390 align:middle line:84%
>> It could be more like the
White Sands experimental thing

00:10:36.390 --> 00:10:39.070 align:middle line:90%
there.

00:10:39.070 --> 00:10:41.500 align:middle line:84%
And in other words
too, my opinion

00:10:41.500 --> 00:10:46.600 align:middle line:84%
is that these people that
are coming around over here,

00:10:46.600 --> 00:10:51.305 align:middle line:84%
they're trying to
see how we live.

00:10:51.305 --> 00:10:52.105 align:middle line:90%
Because--

00:10:52.105 --> 00:10:53.040 align:middle line:90%
>> They were curious.

00:10:53.040 --> 00:10:54.130 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:10:54.130 --> 00:10:58.700 align:middle line:84%
Because if they were
out here to kill us,

00:10:58.700 --> 00:11:01.340 align:middle line:90%
it'd be really easy for them.

00:11:01.340 --> 00:11:04.030 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't take long for them
to get down here from up there,

00:11:04.030 --> 00:11:05.040 align:middle line:90%
you know?

00:11:05.040 --> 00:11:10.520 align:middle line:84%
It takes us forever to get
up from here to the moon.

00:11:10.520 --> 00:11:12.457 align:middle line:84%
And that's what I
think, you know?

00:11:12.457 --> 00:11:14.290 align:middle line:84%
They're trying to find
out, see the way we--

00:11:14.290 --> 00:11:17.340 align:middle line:84%
>> I mean, it would have to
be a big coincidence that this

00:11:17.340 --> 00:11:21.400 align:middle line:84%
happened just a few days after
an atomic bomb was exploded

00:11:21.400 --> 00:11:22.200 align:middle line:90%
right here.

00:11:22.200 --> 00:11:25.950 align:middle line:84%
>> That's why I say they
were trying to find out what

00:11:25.950 --> 00:11:27.965 align:middle line:90%
happened, and what we had--

00:11:27.965 --> 00:11:29.130 align:middle line:90%
>> What we had done.

00:11:29.130 --> 00:11:30.892 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:11:30.892 --> 00:11:34.620 align:middle line:84%
>> One of the most outstanding
aspects of the case is that

00:11:34.620 --> 00:11:37.500 align:middle line:84%
they had a clear vision of
the beings that were injured

00:11:37.500 --> 00:11:39.120 align:middle line:90%
in the ship.

00:11:39.120 --> 00:11:43.320 align:middle line:84%
They all appeared hurt, and one
of them couldn't move at all.

00:11:43.320 --> 00:11:45.450 align:middle line:84%
The children watched
them with binoculars

00:11:45.450 --> 00:11:48.216 align:middle line:90%
for almost two hours.

00:11:48.216 --> 00:11:49.995 align:middle line:90%
>> But it was--

00:11:49.995 --> 00:11:51.960 align:middle line:90%
>> You saw the little creatures?

00:11:51.960 --> 00:11:54.690 align:middle line:84%
>> From here, yes,
with the binoculars.

00:11:54.690 --> 00:11:55.490 align:middle line:90%
We used--

00:11:55.490 --> 00:11:55.650 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, you had binoculars?

00:11:55.650 --> 00:11:56.360 align:middle line:90%
>> --to carry binoculars.

00:11:56.360 --> 00:11:57.960 align:middle line:84%
Oh yeah, we had
carried binoculars.

00:11:57.960 --> 00:12:00.574 align:middle line:90%
I still have them.

00:12:00.574 --> 00:12:02.990 align:middle line:84%
>> That's why you
saw them so clearly?

00:12:02.990 --> 00:12:04.400 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah!

00:12:04.400 --> 00:12:07.845 align:middle line:90%
>> Both of you.

00:12:07.845 --> 00:12:10.090 align:middle line:90%
How many creatures you saw?

00:12:10.090 --> 00:12:10.890 align:middle line:90%
>> Four.

00:12:10.890 --> 00:12:12.246 align:middle line:90%
>> Four creatures?

00:12:12.246 --> 00:12:15.410 align:middle line:90%
>> Four.

00:12:15.410 --> 00:12:19.040 align:middle line:90%
Three of them were running--

00:12:19.040 --> 00:12:21.110 align:middle line:84%
you could see it
through that hole--

00:12:21.110 --> 00:12:28.000 align:middle line:84%
running back and forth like they
were hurt, they were injured.

00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:32.140 align:middle line:84%
And the other one just sitting
right there in the side.

00:12:32.140 --> 00:12:36.280 align:middle line:84%
I don't know if that
guy was dead or was hurt

00:12:36.280 --> 00:12:38.260 align:middle line:90%
and couldn't move.

00:12:38.260 --> 00:12:43.040 align:middle line:84%
That's why I decided to
go down there to help him.

00:12:43.040 --> 00:12:47.140 align:middle line:90%
But Reme doesn't let me.

00:12:47.140 --> 00:12:48.400 align:middle line:90%
He was scared.

00:12:48.400 --> 00:12:51.310 align:middle line:84%
Like I said, I told
you before, maybe

00:12:51.310 --> 00:12:54.220 align:middle line:84%
if I would have gone up there,
I wouldn't be here today,

00:12:54.220 --> 00:12:55.510 align:middle line:90%
you know?

00:12:55.510 --> 00:12:59.020 align:middle line:90%
I'd be somewhere else, you know?

00:12:59.020 --> 00:13:01.400 align:middle line:90%
>> Were they screaming?

00:13:01.400 --> 00:13:05.280 align:middle line:84%
>> They had a scream
like a jackrabbit.

00:13:05.280 --> 00:13:07.920 align:middle line:84%
What do you call a
jackrabbit in Spanish?

00:13:07.920 --> 00:13:08.720 align:middle line:90%
La liebre?

00:13:08.720 --> 00:13:09.520 align:middle line:90%
>> Si.

00:13:09.520 --> 00:13:11.050 align:middle line:90%
>> Liebre.

00:13:11.050 --> 00:13:13.380 align:middle line:84%
Like, when we used to
shoot them and they

00:13:13.380 --> 00:13:17.350 align:middle line:84%
used to squeal
[SQUEALING] like a baby.

00:13:17.350 --> 00:13:22.005 align:middle line:84%
That's why I say that they
were hurt, they were injured.

00:13:22.005 --> 00:13:24.981 align:middle line:90%
>> All of them were screaming?

00:13:24.981 --> 00:13:26.120 align:middle line:90%
>> All?

00:13:26.120 --> 00:13:27.120 align:middle line:90%
we don't know, you know?

00:13:27.120 --> 00:13:30.670 align:middle line:84%
It was off and on,
off and on, you know?

00:13:30.670 --> 00:13:35.580 align:middle line:84%
But we were here for
about an hour and a half,

00:13:35.580 --> 00:13:39.150 align:middle line:84%
almost an hour and 45 minutes,
two hours watching them.

00:13:39.150 --> 00:13:42.516 align:middle line:84%
>> You saw them
very, very clear?

00:13:42.516 --> 00:13:44.070 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh yeah.

00:13:44.070 --> 00:13:49.110 align:middle line:84%
They were-- like I said, I
could see the four fingers,

00:13:49.110 --> 00:13:52.200 align:middle line:90%
the long arms.

00:13:52.200 --> 00:13:56.190 align:middle line:90%
And they didn't have no ears.

00:13:56.190 --> 00:14:02.380 align:middle line:84%
So I thought maybe they had
an overall or a uniform.

00:14:02.380 --> 00:14:11.760 align:middle line:90%
But the mouth was kind of small.

00:14:11.760 --> 00:14:14.670 align:middle line:84%
And that's what the
song was coming out of.

00:14:14.670 --> 00:14:18.990 align:middle line:84%
It wasn't a mouth
like ours, you know?

00:14:18.990 --> 00:14:24.075 align:middle line:84%
No beard, it was just a
straight slicker like a uniform.

00:14:24.075 --> 00:14:27.216 align:middle line:90%


00:14:27.216 --> 00:14:30.850 align:middle line:84%
>> What kind of
insect remind you?

00:14:30.850 --> 00:14:37.290 align:middle line:84%
>> Like hormiga, an ant--
you know those red ants?--

00:14:37.290 --> 00:14:39.130 align:middle line:90%
standing up.

00:14:39.130 --> 00:14:42.068 align:middle line:84%
Have you ever seen
them standing up?

00:14:42.068 --> 00:14:43.110 align:middle line:90%
It's something like that.

00:14:43.110 --> 00:14:47.510 align:middle line:84%
>> Somebody said in Spanish,
it would be cara de niño.

00:14:47.510 --> 00:14:49.030 align:middle line:90%
What is that?

00:14:49.030 --> 00:14:51.190 align:middle line:84%
>> There is another
red thing like--

00:14:51.190 --> 00:14:51.990 align:middle line:90%
>> Maybe--

00:14:51.990 --> 00:14:53.490 align:middle line:90%
>> --niño de la tierra.

00:14:53.490 --> 00:14:54.530 align:middle line:90%
>> Si.

00:14:54.530 --> 00:14:56.130 align:middle line:90%
>> It's something like that.

00:14:56.130 --> 00:15:00.580 align:middle line:90%
It almost resembles an ant.

00:15:00.580 --> 00:15:06.060 align:middle line:84%
But if you would get
an ant and draw it up--

00:15:06.060 --> 00:15:07.690 align:middle line:90%
a big picture of it--

00:15:07.690 --> 00:15:11.210 align:middle line:84%
it would be something like
that except for the arms.

00:15:11.210 --> 00:15:13.350 align:middle line:90%
>> Children of the earth?

00:15:13.350 --> 00:15:17.390 align:middle line:90%
>> Children on the Earth, yeah.

00:15:17.390 --> 00:15:19.160 align:middle line:90%
There was something like that.

00:15:19.160 --> 00:15:23.655 align:middle line:84%
But the niño de la
tierra is usually curled.

00:15:23.655 --> 00:15:26.270 align:middle line:90%


00:15:26.270 --> 00:15:28.960 align:middle line:84%
Now if he was
straightened upright,

00:15:28.960 --> 00:15:32.110 align:middle line:84%
he would resemble
something like that.

00:15:32.110 --> 00:15:33.950 align:middle line:90%
And according to the head--

00:15:33.950 --> 00:15:38.580 align:middle line:84%
the head more likely
look like an ant.

00:15:38.580 --> 00:15:46.164 align:middle line:84%
It was shaped like that, with
teardrop eyes and no ears.

00:15:46.164 --> 00:15:47.902 align:middle line:90%
>> How tall?

00:15:47.902 --> 00:15:52.390 align:middle line:90%
>> OK, we were about that tall.

00:15:52.390 --> 00:15:54.450 align:middle line:90%
I would say 3 and 1/2 feet.

00:15:54.450 --> 00:15:57.770 align:middle line:90%


00:15:57.770 --> 00:15:58.590 align:middle line:90%
>> 3 and 1/2 feet?

00:15:58.590 --> 00:15:59.790 align:middle line:90%
>> About 3 and 1/2 feet.

00:15:59.790 --> 00:16:00.590 align:middle line:90%
Just like us.

00:16:00.590 --> 00:16:04.160 align:middle line:84%
You know, we were little
kids then, you know?

00:16:04.160 --> 00:16:06.500 align:middle line:90%
>> Did you feel scared by them?

00:16:06.500 --> 00:16:07.300 align:middle line:90%
>> No.

00:16:07.300 --> 00:16:08.100 align:middle line:90%
>> No?

00:16:08.100 --> 00:16:11.300 align:middle line:84%
>> No, I have never
been scared of nothing.

00:16:11.300 --> 00:16:14.545 align:middle line:84%
That's why I wanted to
go in there, you know?

00:16:14.545 --> 00:16:16.250 align:middle line:90%
>> Were you impressed?

00:16:16.250 --> 00:16:19.210 align:middle line:84%
Did you know they weren't
from the earth at that moment?

00:16:19.210 --> 00:16:20.350 align:middle line:90%
>> No?

00:16:20.350 --> 00:16:21.267 align:middle line:90%
>> What did you think?

00:16:21.267 --> 00:16:24.760 align:middle line:84%
>> I thought that
something crashed,

00:16:24.760 --> 00:16:26.760 align:middle line:84%
that those guys
out there are hurt.

00:16:26.760 --> 00:16:29.590 align:middle line:90%
Let's go help them, you know.

00:16:29.590 --> 00:16:33.130 align:middle line:84%
My intentions has been
for life, you know?

00:16:33.130 --> 00:16:38.170 align:middle line:84%
If I see anybody getting hurt,
I try to go and help them

00:16:38.170 --> 00:16:39.330 align:middle line:90%
if I can help.

00:16:39.330 --> 00:16:41.530 align:middle line:84%
If I can't help, I
just go around and keep

00:16:41.530 --> 00:16:43.090 align:middle line:90%
on going my way, you know?

00:16:43.090 --> 00:16:44.980 align:middle line:84%
And that's what I
thought about this.

00:16:44.980 --> 00:16:47.230 align:middle line:84%
They were running back and
forth, squealing, you know?

00:16:47.230 --> 00:16:50.298 align:middle line:84%
>> Did you realize
they were not humans?

00:16:50.298 --> 00:16:55.210 align:middle line:84%
>> To me, they looked like
little boys since they were

00:16:55.210 --> 00:16:56.890 align:middle line:90%
short, you know?

00:16:56.890 --> 00:16:59.740 align:middle line:84%
The only thing different
on them that was surprising

00:16:59.740 --> 00:17:02.590 align:middle line:84%
is the four fingers
and the long arms.

00:17:02.590 --> 00:17:06.640 align:middle line:84%
Then I remember a monkey
has got long arms.

00:17:06.640 --> 00:17:09.730 align:middle line:84%
>> When did you realize that
what you saw probably was not

00:17:09.730 --> 00:17:10.530 align:middle line:90%
from this earth?

00:17:10.530 --> 00:17:14.440 align:middle line:90%


00:17:14.440 --> 00:17:19.240 align:middle line:84%
>> I never thought anything
about that until they started

00:17:19.240 --> 00:17:25.089 align:middle line:84%
bringing out that UFOs,
like Roswell and all that.

00:17:25.089 --> 00:17:30.200 align:middle line:84%
That's when I thought, well,
was that thing that we've seen,

00:17:30.200 --> 00:17:32.560 align:middle line:90%
you know?

00:17:32.560 --> 00:17:35.470 align:middle line:84%
>> It is remarkable the
similarity of the description

00:17:35.470 --> 00:17:38.980 align:middle line:84%
that was offered by witnesses
who observed what appeared

00:17:38.980 --> 00:17:43.720 align:middle line:84%
to be alien beings in the
cases of Roswell and Aztec,

00:17:43.720 --> 00:17:48.670 align:middle line:84%
and what also occurred in New
Mexico in subsequent years.

00:17:48.670 --> 00:17:51.700 align:middle line:84%
Four days after the
accident on August 20th,

00:17:51.700 --> 00:17:53.800 align:middle line:84%
seven members of the
army were assigned

00:17:53.800 --> 00:17:57.910 align:middle line:84%
to the security of the
Los Alamos nuclear base,

00:17:57.910 --> 00:18:01.600 align:middle line:84%
the same men that had
participated as test subjects

00:18:01.600 --> 00:18:06.016 align:middle line:84%
to measure the effects of
the atomic bomb on humans.

00:18:06.016 --> 00:18:10.766 align:middle line:84%
>> Who told the military
that this craft was here?

00:18:10.766 --> 00:18:18.040 align:middle line:84%
>> That William Bodi
from Hollywood, Florida,

00:18:18.040 --> 00:18:23.000 align:middle line:84%
was assigned from the Stallion
site in White Sands on a plane

00:18:23.000 --> 00:18:26.530 align:middle line:84%
to check around for
weather balloons.

00:18:26.530 --> 00:18:30.200 align:middle line:10%
And that's when he
reported that there

00:18:30.200 --> 00:18:35.210 align:middle line:10%
was an object on the ground,
and there was two little Indians

00:18:35.210 --> 00:18:37.070 align:middle line:10%
on horses watching it.

00:18:37.070 --> 00:18:39.695 align:middle line:90%
That's what we were here.

00:18:39.695 --> 00:18:40.700 align:middle line:90%
>> He saw you?

00:18:40.700 --> 00:18:42.868 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, he saw us.

00:18:42.868 --> 00:18:43.910 align:middle line:90%
He reported us, you know?

00:18:43.910 --> 00:18:49.550 align:middle line:84%
We were two little
Indians on two horses.

00:18:49.550 --> 00:18:51.518 align:middle line:84%
And that's when they
started coming in

00:18:51.518 --> 00:18:56.886 align:middle line:84%
after-- this was about four
days after it had happened.

00:18:56.886 --> 00:19:02.520 align:middle line:84%
>> Jose and Remigio watched the
military work for several days.

00:19:02.520 --> 00:19:05.120 align:middle line:84%
They were waiting for a
chance to grab a souvenir

00:19:05.120 --> 00:19:09.470 align:middle line:84%
from the ship to remember
their experience.

00:19:09.470 --> 00:19:12.440 align:middle line:84%
They didn't know that it
was a ship from outer space

00:19:12.440 --> 00:19:15.980 align:middle line:90%
that held nonhuman beings.

00:19:15.980 --> 00:19:19.370 align:middle line:84%
In 1945, that concept
did not exist, especially

00:19:19.370 --> 00:19:21.710 align:middle line:84%
for two children who
were born and raised

00:19:21.710 --> 00:19:26.520 align:middle line:84%
in the countryside
far from civilization.

00:19:26.520 --> 00:19:30.330 align:middle line:84%
They just wanted
a little souvenir.

00:19:30.330 --> 00:19:33.870 align:middle line:84%
After the soldiers loaded
the ship onto a truck,

00:19:33.870 --> 00:19:37.860 align:middle line:84%
they drove it to an old
barn in San Antonio.

00:19:37.860 --> 00:19:40.620 align:middle line:84%
It was there that
they entered the ship

00:19:40.620 --> 00:19:42.720 align:middle line:84%
and took a souvenir,
which they have

00:19:42.720 --> 00:19:48.984 align:middle line:84%
kept for more than 70 years
and are now revealing to us.

00:19:48.984 --> 00:19:52.290 align:middle line:84%
>> The last day that they
came over and they loaded up

00:19:52.290 --> 00:19:55.770 align:middle line:84%
everything up here, put
the tarp on it, the ropes.

00:19:55.770 --> 00:19:59.250 align:middle line:84%
We were hiding up
there looking at them.

00:19:59.250 --> 00:20:03.570 align:middle line:84%
All seven of them all got
in the Jeep in the evening

00:20:03.570 --> 00:20:06.620 align:middle line:84%
and took off to go see
the girls in the Owl Bar.

00:20:06.620 --> 00:20:08.576 align:middle line:90%
>> And that's up there?

00:20:08.576 --> 00:20:11.700 align:middle line:84%
>> That's when we decided
to come down here.

00:20:11.700 --> 00:20:14.562 align:middle line:90%
There was no one over here.

00:20:14.562 --> 00:20:17.580 align:middle line:84%
>> The craft was in
the trailer already?

00:20:17.580 --> 00:20:21.880 align:middle line:84%
>> It was on the trailer with a
tarp on top and the ropes tied

00:20:21.880 --> 00:20:22.680 align:middle line:90%
down.

00:20:22.680 --> 00:20:24.190 align:middle line:90%
>> And was alone here?

00:20:24.190 --> 00:20:25.600 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, by itself, yeah.

00:20:25.600 --> 00:20:26.400 align:middle line:90%
There was no one.

00:20:26.400 --> 00:20:30.050 align:middle line:84%
They took off on the Jeep
and took off, you know?

00:20:30.050 --> 00:20:33.700 align:middle line:84%
I don't know what
time they came back,

00:20:33.700 --> 00:20:39.120 align:middle line:84%
but that object was moved
that night around 12 o'clock.

00:20:39.120 --> 00:20:42.855 align:middle line:84%
Because at 12 o'clock,
San Antonio is asleep.

00:20:42.855 --> 00:20:46.470 align:middle line:90%


00:20:46.470 --> 00:20:51.150 align:middle line:84%
And the following day, we came
out here and it wasn't here.

00:20:51.150 --> 00:20:54.818 align:middle line:84%
But we had seen
it the day before.

00:20:54.818 --> 00:20:59.000 align:middle line:84%
>> It wasn't long before the
military realized that a piece

00:20:59.000 --> 00:21:02.726 align:middle line:84%
from the inside of
the ship was missing.

00:21:02.726 --> 00:21:06.080 align:middle line:84%
>> They took inventory of what
they loaded on the trailer.

00:21:06.080 --> 00:21:08.620 align:middle line:90%


00:21:08.620 --> 00:21:11.560 align:middle line:84%
But like I said, someone broke
in there and took something.

00:21:11.560 --> 00:21:13.720 align:middle line:84%
When they got over there,
they took inventory,

00:21:13.720 --> 00:21:15.530 align:middle line:90%
and a piece was missing.

00:21:15.530 --> 00:21:18.550 align:middle line:90%


00:21:18.550 --> 00:21:19.995 align:middle line:84%
They couldn't find
out who it was.

00:21:19.995 --> 00:21:21.240 align:middle line:90%
>> They came back?

00:21:21.240 --> 00:21:27.380 align:middle line:84%
>> They came back two days
afterwards to my dad's ranch,

00:21:27.380 --> 00:21:32.280 align:middle line:84%
the house, and asked, seeing
if there was anything that

00:21:32.280 --> 00:21:34.590 align:middle line:90%
belonged to the military.

00:21:34.590 --> 00:21:36.700 align:middle line:84%
That's when my dad
told Manuel, there's

00:21:36.700 --> 00:21:41.680 align:middle line:84%
some weather balloons that are
sitting out there on the shack,

00:21:41.680 --> 00:21:42.870 align:middle line:90%
you know?

00:21:42.870 --> 00:21:44.620 align:middle line:84%
They went over and
they took that.

00:21:44.620 --> 00:21:53.160 align:middle line:84%
But afterwards-- back
in 1965, my cousin

00:21:53.160 --> 00:21:57.270 align:middle line:84%
was driving up here to
go check the windmill.

00:21:57.270 --> 00:22:01.500 align:middle line:84%
And they pulled him over
before the cattle guard.

00:22:01.500 --> 00:22:06.410 align:middle line:84%
The soldiers pulled him over
and they wouldn't let him cross.

00:22:06.410 --> 00:22:07.210 align:middle line:90%
>> Why?

00:22:07.210 --> 00:22:10.300 align:middle line:84%
>> They went after
something that was missing.

00:22:10.300 --> 00:22:12.270 align:middle line:90%
>> They didn't come here?

00:22:12.270 --> 00:22:15.215 align:middle line:84%
>> It possible that
they were out here too.

00:22:15.215 --> 00:22:17.090 align:middle line:84%
But they were stopping
all traffic out there.

00:22:17.090 --> 00:22:20.060 align:middle line:84%
Because there's a Y where you
go to Biancas and Padilla.

00:22:20.060 --> 00:22:25.070 align:middle line:84%
>> So you think they came to
look for the pieces here or no?

00:22:25.070 --> 00:22:27.610 align:middle line:90%


00:22:27.610 --> 00:22:30.250 align:middle line:90%
>> It's possible that they did.

00:22:30.250 --> 00:22:32.910 align:middle line:84%
But they didn't look
too good, though.

00:22:32.910 --> 00:22:36.950 align:middle line:84%
>> According to Jose Padilla,
some of the parts of the ship

00:22:36.950 --> 00:22:39.941 align:middle line:90%
are still buried at the site.

00:22:39.941 --> 00:22:42.290 align:middle line:84%
>> Where did they bury
the pieces, right there,

00:22:42.290 --> 00:22:43.690 align:middle line:90%
right here?

00:22:43.690 --> 00:22:45.990 align:middle line:84%
>> No, the crevice
was right here.

00:22:45.990 --> 00:22:49.182 align:middle line:90%


00:22:49.182 --> 00:22:50.250 align:middle line:90%
It was right here.

00:22:50.250 --> 00:22:52.330 align:middle line:84%
[INAUDIBLE] sitting right
there, and the crevice

00:22:52.330 --> 00:22:53.810 align:middle line:90%
was right next to it.

00:22:53.810 --> 00:22:57.390 align:middle line:84%
And they used to come
down and come right-- see

00:22:57.390 --> 00:22:59.670 align:middle line:90%
where that clay is right there?

00:22:59.670 --> 00:23:02.732 align:middle line:84%
Used to come right
straight down like that.

00:23:02.732 --> 00:23:03.825 align:middle line:90%
>> The stream?

00:23:03.825 --> 00:23:05.230 align:middle line:90%
>> The stream, yeah.

00:23:05.230 --> 00:23:06.382 align:middle line:90%
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:23:06.382 --> 00:23:08.340 align:middle line:84%
>> On the side of the
stream, they buried this?

00:23:08.340 --> 00:23:09.876 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:23:09.876 --> 00:23:10.935 align:middle line:90%
>> How many pieces?

00:23:10.935 --> 00:23:12.343 align:middle line:90%
It was too much?

00:23:12.343 --> 00:23:14.760 align:middle line:84%
>> I couldn't tell you how
many, because I didn't know it.

00:23:14.760 --> 00:23:16.260 align:middle line:84%
They were kicking
it with their feet

00:23:16.260 --> 00:23:20.625 align:middle line:84%
and they're pushing it in and
putting dirt on top of it.

00:23:20.625 --> 00:23:21.825 align:middle line:90%
>> This was before Roswell?

00:23:21.825 --> 00:23:24.046 align:middle line:90%


00:23:24.046 --> 00:23:24.846 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes it was.

00:23:24.846 --> 00:23:25.980 align:middle line:90%
>> Roswell was in 1947.

00:23:25.980 --> 00:23:27.326 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:23:27.326 --> 00:23:29.230 align:middle line:84%
>> Then at that
moment, probably,

00:23:29.230 --> 00:23:31.730 align:middle line:84%
they were not so
concerned about security.

00:23:31.730 --> 00:23:37.680 align:middle line:84%
>> We were-- the United States
was too busy fighting the war,

00:23:37.680 --> 00:23:39.480 align:middle line:90%
you know?

00:23:39.480 --> 00:23:45.360 align:middle line:84%
Waiting for them to send
Jumbo or Big Fat Boy from here

00:23:45.360 --> 00:23:50.100 align:middle line:84%
to beat the hell out
of Iwo Jima, you know?

00:23:50.100 --> 00:23:52.719 align:middle line:84%
That's why they never
investigated over here.

00:23:52.719 --> 00:23:56.850 align:middle line:90%


00:23:56.850 --> 00:24:01.150 align:middle line:84%
>> The case of San Antonio,
New Mexico is extraordinary.

00:24:01.150 --> 00:24:04.810 align:middle line:84%
Because it was the first ship
that landed near Los Alamos

00:24:04.810 --> 00:24:09.320 align:middle line:84%
not long after the detonation
of atomic bombs there.

00:24:09.320 --> 00:24:12.370 align:middle line:84%
In addition, it is believed
that it was the first one that

00:24:12.370 --> 00:24:15.850 align:middle line:84%
crashed as a result of the
powerful military microwave

00:24:15.850 --> 00:24:17.920 align:middle line:90%
radars at the site.

00:24:17.920 --> 00:24:22.060 align:middle line:84%
The radars were there to protect
the Los Alamos nuclear plant.

00:24:22.060 --> 00:24:24.490 align:middle line:84%
It's the case that,
without any doubt,

00:24:24.490 --> 00:24:29.256 align:middle line:84%
raises many questions that
still must be answered.

00:24:29.256 --> 00:24:32.370 align:middle line:84%
>> After you had
investigated this case,

00:24:32.370 --> 00:24:35.080 align:middle line:84%
after you talked to Reme
Baca and Jose Padilla,

00:24:35.080 --> 00:24:39.635 align:middle line:84%
after you have learned so
many details about the case,

00:24:39.635 --> 00:24:40.635 align:middle line:90%
what do you think of it?

00:24:40.635 --> 00:24:42.590 align:middle line:90%
>> I think it's an amazing case.

00:24:42.590 --> 00:24:43.790 align:middle line:90%
We've got everything here.

00:24:43.790 --> 00:24:47.930 align:middle line:84%
We have the site, and the
site it needs to be examined,

00:24:47.930 --> 00:24:49.460 align:middle line:90%
the soil and so forth.

00:24:49.460 --> 00:24:51.670 align:middle line:90%
We have the witnesses.

00:24:51.670 --> 00:24:53.630 align:middle line:90%
And we have a piece.

00:24:53.630 --> 00:24:55.205 align:middle line:90%
What else has that?

00:24:55.205 --> 00:24:58.730 align:middle line:84%
The problem with the
case is it is so simple.

00:24:58.730 --> 00:25:03.290 align:middle line:84%
It's so simple that it's
hard for people to believe.

00:25:03.290 --> 00:25:04.955 align:middle line:90%
You've talked to Jose.

00:25:04.955 --> 00:25:06.920 align:middle line:84%
He's telling you
the truth is simple.

00:25:06.920 --> 00:25:10.560 align:middle line:84%
So they say if it walks like a
duck, if it quacks like a duck,

00:25:10.560 --> 00:25:13.320 align:middle line:84%
it's a duck, which
means this is a case.

00:25:13.320 --> 00:25:14.120 align:middle line:90%
This is a case.

00:25:14.120 --> 00:25:15.080 align:middle line:90%
>> It's real?

00:25:15.080 --> 00:25:15.927 align:middle line:90%
>> It's real.

00:25:15.927 --> 00:25:16.760 align:middle line:90%
I mean, it's simple.

00:25:16.760 --> 00:25:19.100 align:middle line:90%
It's so simple it's real.

00:25:19.100 --> 00:25:23.460 align:middle line:84%
What needs to happen now is the
analysis, which you're doing

00:25:23.460 --> 00:25:28.190 align:middle line:84%
and we're doing on the piece,
the analysis on the soil.

00:25:28.190 --> 00:25:32.330 align:middle line:84%
And the problem is that
we waited too long.

00:25:32.330 --> 00:25:33.590 align:middle line:90%
Don Schmitt talks about this.

00:25:33.590 --> 00:25:35.090 align:middle line:84%
We wait too long,
the people die,

00:25:35.090 --> 00:25:37.850 align:middle line:84%
so we don't have
any more witnesses.

00:25:37.850 --> 00:25:39.650 align:middle line:84%
We can't, because
it's so long ago.

00:25:39.650 --> 00:25:41.970 align:middle line:90%
It's 69 years ago.

00:25:41.970 --> 00:25:46.130 align:middle line:84%
But I think that we're very
lucky to speak to Jose Padilla

00:25:46.130 --> 00:25:47.690 align:middle line:90%
while he's still here.

00:25:47.690 --> 00:25:52.090 align:middle line:84%
And we're very lucky to have
him take us on the location

00:25:52.090 --> 00:25:53.940 align:middle line:90%
while he's still here.

00:25:53.940 --> 00:25:56.510 align:middle line:84%
So I think the way I
feel as a researcher--

00:25:56.510 --> 00:25:59.300 align:middle line:84%
and you asked me that--
is this is history.

00:25:59.300 --> 00:26:02.390 align:middle line:84%
We just recorded history
for our grandchildren,

00:26:02.390 --> 00:26:04.730 align:middle line:84%
our great-grandchildren, our
great-great-grandchildren,

00:26:04.730 --> 00:26:07.130 align:middle line:90%
and for his grandchildren.

00:26:07.130 --> 00:26:10.610 align:middle line:84%
I hope we to give
his grandchildren

00:26:10.610 --> 00:26:14.085 align:middle line:84%
a copy of what we did, which
is the most important thing

00:26:14.085 --> 00:26:14.885 align:middle line:90%
of all.

00:26:14.885 --> 00:26:19.215 align:middle line:84%
>> Why they waited game until
2003 to release this story?

00:26:19.215 --> 00:26:21.660 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, because they
couldn't find each other.

00:26:21.660 --> 00:26:24.570 align:middle line:84%
Because when Jose came
back to look for Reme,

00:26:24.570 --> 00:26:26.310 align:middle line:84%
he had moved to Gig
Harbor, Washington.

00:26:26.310 --> 00:26:30.610 align:middle line:84%
It is only because
of Jose's son, Sammy,

00:26:30.610 --> 00:26:32.970 align:middle line:84%
that did a genealogical
check where

00:26:32.970 --> 00:26:34.940 align:middle line:90%
he found out where Reme was.

00:26:34.940 --> 00:26:36.030 align:middle line:90%
And this is years later.

00:26:36.030 --> 00:26:39.218 align:middle line:84%
Reme had gone somewhere else,
they didn't know where he was.

00:26:39.218 --> 00:26:41.760 align:middle line:84%
And when they found out where
Reme was, they got on the phone

00:26:41.760 --> 00:26:44.640 align:middle line:84%
like two boys, and they said,
do you remember what happened?

00:26:44.640 --> 00:26:47.790 align:middle line:84%
And the other one said, yes,
do you remember what happened?

00:26:47.790 --> 00:26:52.050 align:middle line:84%
And naturally,
Reme says to Jose,

00:26:52.050 --> 00:26:53.970 align:middle line:84%
do you remember what
you took out of there?

00:26:53.970 --> 00:26:55.690 align:middle line:84%
And he said, where
is it right now?

00:26:55.690 --> 00:27:01.140 align:middle line:84%
And then Jose proceeded
to mail it to Reme.

00:27:01.140 --> 00:27:02.100 align:middle line:90%
Reme had the piece.

00:27:02.100 --> 00:27:05.550 align:middle line:84%
You saw it in your first
film that you took of him.

00:27:05.550 --> 00:27:07.820 align:middle line:90%
And this is how they connected.

00:27:07.820 --> 00:27:10.950 align:middle line:84%
It was by coincidence that
they found each other again

00:27:10.950 --> 00:27:13.680 align:middle line:84%
that we're able to
verify their story.

00:27:13.680 --> 00:27:15.570 align:middle line:84%
Because they both
experienced that.

00:27:15.570 --> 00:27:18.770 align:middle line:84%
There's nobody else
that experienced that.

00:27:18.770 --> 00:27:22.490 align:middle line:84%
And we're very lucky, because
we were able to get both of them

00:27:22.490 --> 00:27:23.400 align:middle line:90%
while they're alive.

00:27:23.400 --> 00:27:30.100 align:middle line:84%
>> In this story, besides the
metal and we have the testimony

00:27:30.100 --> 00:27:33.230 align:middle line:90%
of two little kids.

00:27:33.230 --> 00:27:35.990 align:middle line:90%
I never heard that story before.

00:27:35.990 --> 00:27:39.695 align:middle line:84%
I mean, the main witnesses
were two little kids.

00:27:39.695 --> 00:27:41.780 align:middle line:84%
>> 9 years old and
6 years old, yeah.

00:27:41.780 --> 00:27:43.490 align:middle line:84%
Why would they invent
all those details?

00:27:43.490 --> 00:27:46.490 align:middle line:84%
And we have details,
so many details.

00:27:46.490 --> 00:27:51.600 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, they were in the wrong
place at the wrong time.

00:27:51.600 --> 00:27:55.100 align:middle line:90%
And this event for them--

00:27:55.100 --> 00:27:57.980 align:middle line:84%
because there was no
television, there was no movies,

00:27:57.980 --> 00:28:00.090 align:middle line:84%
there was no talk
of it in 1944--

00:28:00.090 --> 00:28:02.870 align:middle line:84%
they didn't even
know what UFO's were.

00:28:02.870 --> 00:28:07.840 align:middle line:84%
Basically, for two little kids,
it's purity, it's innocence.

00:28:07.840 --> 00:28:10.340 align:middle line:84%
They're telling the truth,
because they have nothing

00:28:10.340 --> 00:28:11.570 align:middle line:90%
like today--

00:28:11.570 --> 00:28:13.700 align:middle line:84%
the science fiction--
to compare it to.

00:28:13.700 --> 00:28:15.350 align:middle line:84%
They have nothing
to compare it to.

00:28:15.350 --> 00:28:17.660 align:middle line:84%
What's totally amazing is
that one of the little kids

00:28:17.660 --> 00:28:20.145 align:middle line:84%
went inside the craft
and wanted a souvenir.

00:28:20.145 --> 00:28:21.570 align:middle line:90%
>> And they got it.

00:28:21.570 --> 00:28:23.470 align:middle line:90%
>> And they got it.

00:28:23.470 --> 00:28:25.400 align:middle line:84%
And even though
the military tried

00:28:25.400 --> 00:28:28.790 align:middle line:90%
to take the souvenir back--

00:28:28.790 --> 00:28:32.210 align:middle line:84%
because a part of the
inventory was missing--

00:28:32.210 --> 00:28:35.150 align:middle line:84%
he was able to keep that
souvenir for all these years

00:28:35.150 --> 00:28:37.230 align:middle line:84%
what he called the--
but that's normal.

00:28:37.230 --> 00:28:38.330 align:middle line:90%
A little boy wants--

00:28:38.330 --> 00:28:41.810 align:middle line:84%
I want piece of this,
I want a souvenir.

00:28:41.810 --> 00:28:44.210 align:middle line:84%
So I think it's a very
fascinating story, Jaime.

00:28:44.210 --> 00:28:47.500 align:middle line:84%
And I'm really, really happy
that we were able to do it.

00:28:47.500 --> 00:28:51.020 align:middle line:84%
>> Today we know that the
first radars developed were

00:28:51.020 --> 00:28:54.890 align:middle line:84%
dangerous, not only for the
people who operated them

00:28:54.890 --> 00:28:57.640 align:middle line:90%
but for airplanes in flight.

00:28:57.640 --> 00:29:01.390 align:middle line:10%
The radars could interfere
with their electronic devices

00:29:01.390 --> 00:29:04.330 align:middle line:10%
and cause them to crash.

00:29:04.330 --> 00:29:07.360 align:middle line:84%
Many years before,
agent Guy Hottel

00:29:07.360 --> 00:29:09.880 align:middle line:84%
had become aware
of the crashed UFOs

00:29:09.880 --> 00:29:12.370 align:middle line:90%
in the vicinity of Los Alamos.

00:29:12.370 --> 00:29:16.240 align:middle line:84%
Hottel had informed J. Edgar
Hoover, director of the FBI,

00:29:16.240 --> 00:29:17.950 align:middle line:84%
that the ships had
been brought down

00:29:17.950 --> 00:29:20.800 align:middle line:84%
due to the interference
of powerful radars,

00:29:20.800 --> 00:29:22.985 align:middle line:84%
that it interfered with
their navigation system.

00:29:22.985 --> 00:29:26.740 align:middle line:90%


00:29:26.740 --> 00:29:31.150 align:middle line:84%
Later, these radars were taken
out of operation in 1957,

00:29:31.150 --> 00:29:35.530 align:middle line:84%
because they were very dangerous
for aircraft and for humans.

00:29:35.530 --> 00:29:38.530 align:middle line:10%
We do know that very powerful
experimental models were

00:29:38.530 --> 00:29:44.990 align:middle line:10%
used that transmitted microwaves
and emitted ionized radiation.

00:29:44.990 --> 00:29:48.580 align:middle line:84%
There are no studies
of how many people died

00:29:48.580 --> 00:29:52.450 align:middle line:84%
and how many planes were
lost with that technology

00:29:52.450 --> 00:29:57.390 align:middle line:84%
between 1945 and
1959 in New Mexico.

00:29:57.390 --> 00:30:00.400 align:middle line:84%
However, there was a study
conducted in Belgium,

00:30:00.400 --> 00:30:03.070 align:middle line:90%
which was recently published.

00:30:03.070 --> 00:30:05.430 align:middle line:10%
And according to their
findings, the exposure

00:30:05.430 --> 00:30:07.350 align:middle line:10%
of professional
military personnel

00:30:07.350 --> 00:30:12.360 align:middle line:10%
to antiaircraft radars used
in Europe in the '50s and '60s

00:30:12.360 --> 00:30:16.140 align:middle line:10%
may have increased the incidence
of immune lymphatic cancer.

00:30:16.140 --> 00:30:18.850 align:middle line:10%


00:30:18.850 --> 00:30:22.290 align:middle line:10%
However, they were unable to
identify whether this tumorous

00:30:22.290 --> 00:30:27.030 align:middle line:10%
cancer was due to microwaves
or ionized radiation produced

00:30:27.030 --> 00:30:29.550 align:middle line:10%
by electronic devices.

00:30:29.550 --> 00:30:34.140 align:middle line:84%
This type of radar was
discontinued in 1957,

00:30:34.140 --> 00:30:37.770 align:middle line:84%
not only because they affected
the operator's health,

00:30:37.770 --> 00:30:42.390 align:middle line:84%
but because there was a
real danger to aviation.

00:30:42.390 --> 00:30:44.670 align:middle line:84%
There are unregistered
cases where

00:30:44.670 --> 00:30:47.730 align:middle line:84%
aircraft, mainly of
a military nature,

00:30:47.730 --> 00:30:50.070 align:middle line:84%
crashed as a result
of the radars

00:30:50.070 --> 00:30:53.820 align:middle line:84%
interfering with their
navigation systems.

00:30:53.820 --> 00:30:55.440 align:middle line:84%
It was feared that
at any moment,

00:30:55.440 --> 00:30:58.170 align:middle line:84%
they could cause a commercial
airplane with passengers

00:30:58.170 --> 00:31:00.900 align:middle line:90%
on board to crash.

00:31:00.900 --> 00:31:03.930 align:middle line:84%
Little by little, we're
getting a better understanding

00:31:03.930 --> 00:31:09.240 align:middle line:84%
of what happened in New
Mexico between 1945 and '48.

00:31:09.240 --> 00:31:12.600 align:middle line:10%
We do know that three alien
ships crashed to the ground

00:31:12.600 --> 00:31:16.380 align:middle line:10%
in the vicinity of the
Los Alamos nuclear plant.

00:31:16.380 --> 00:31:22.050 align:middle line:10%
The first incident was in San
Antonio on August 16th, 1945,

00:31:22.050 --> 00:31:27.210 align:middle line:10%
the second in Roswell on
July 2nd or 3rd, 1947,

00:31:27.210 --> 00:31:32.520 align:middle line:10%
and the third in Aztec
on March 25th, 1948.

00:31:32.520 --> 00:31:36.420 align:middle line:84%
These occurrences were
indicated by a short memorandum

00:31:36.420 --> 00:31:39.450 align:middle line:84%
that the FBI has
tried to discredit.

00:31:39.450 --> 00:31:44.310 align:middle line:84%
>> So there is a document in
Ryan Wood and Bob Wood's files

00:31:44.310 --> 00:31:46.020 align:middle line:90%
from Majestic-12.

00:31:46.020 --> 00:31:49.290 align:middle line:84%
It is a letter from
Oppenheimer and Einstein

00:31:49.290 --> 00:31:51.930 align:middle line:84%
called "Relationships
with Celestial Bodies."

00:31:51.930 --> 00:31:58.830 align:middle line:84%
And it went to Truman in
June of 1947, before Roswell.

00:31:58.830 --> 00:32:01.200 align:middle line:84%
And it said to
President Truman, we

00:32:01.200 --> 00:32:04.590 align:middle line:84%
are having a situation
with extraterrestrials

00:32:04.590 --> 00:32:08.360 align:middle line:84%
and we need to put some
protocols in place.

00:32:08.360 --> 00:32:10.788 align:middle line:84%
Because we're seeing
that they're coming.

00:32:10.788 --> 00:32:13.080 align:middle line:84%
This is Einstein and Oppenheimer
who wrote this letter.

00:32:13.080 --> 00:32:15.810 align:middle line:90%
It's in the MJ-12 documents.

00:32:15.810 --> 00:32:19.260 align:middle line:10%
>> A letter was written by
Albert Einstein and Robert

00:32:19.260 --> 00:32:23.280 align:middle line:10%
Oppenheimer to US
President Harry S. Truman.

00:32:23.280 --> 00:32:25.440 align:middle line:84%
Although it has been
questioned whether it

00:32:25.440 --> 00:32:28.980 align:middle line:84%
is authentic evidence, this
is a fragment of that letter.

00:32:28.980 --> 00:32:34.210 align:middle line:90%


00:32:34.210 --> 00:32:37.150 align:middle line:84%
"Relationships with
extraterrestrial men

00:32:37.150 --> 00:32:39.460 align:middle line:84%
presents basically
no new problem

00:32:39.460 --> 00:32:41.980 align:middle line:84%
from the standpoint
of international law.

00:32:41.980 --> 00:32:45.460 align:middle line:84%
But the possibility of
confronting intelligent beings

00:32:45.460 --> 00:32:47.560 align:middle line:84%
that do not belong
to the human race

00:32:47.560 --> 00:32:49.540 align:middle line:84%
would bring up
problems whose solution

00:32:49.540 --> 00:32:52.120 align:middle line:90%
it is difficult to conceive.

00:32:52.120 --> 00:32:54.190 align:middle line:84%
In principle, there
is no difficulty

00:32:54.190 --> 00:32:56.050 align:middle line:84%
in accepting the
possibility of coming

00:32:56.050 --> 00:32:59.050 align:middle line:84%
to an understanding with
them and of establishing

00:32:59.050 --> 00:33:01.300 align:middle line:90%
all kinds of relationships.

00:33:01.300 --> 00:33:04.060 align:middle line:84%
The difficulty lies
in trying to establish

00:33:04.060 --> 00:33:07.780 align:middle line:84%
the principles on which these
relationships should be based.

00:33:07.780 --> 00:33:10.720 align:middle line:84%
In the first place, it would
be necessary to establish

00:33:10.720 --> 00:33:13.990 align:middle line:84%
communication with them
through some language or other,

00:33:13.990 --> 00:33:17.650 align:middle line:84%
and afterwards, as a first
condition for all intelligence,

00:33:17.650 --> 00:33:20.290 align:middle line:84%
that they should have a
psychology similar to that

00:33:20.290 --> 00:33:21.790 align:middle line:90%
of men.

00:33:21.790 --> 00:33:24.880 align:middle line:84%
At any rate, international
law should make place

00:33:24.880 --> 00:33:27.400 align:middle line:84%
for a new law on
a different basis.

00:33:27.400 --> 00:33:31.210 align:middle line:84%
And it might be called 'law
among planetary peoples.'

00:33:31.210 --> 00:33:34.240 align:middle line:84%
following the guidelines
found in the Pentateuch.

00:33:34.240 --> 00:33:36.670 align:middle line:10%
Obviously, the idea
of revolutionizing

00:33:36.670 --> 00:33:38.530 align:middle line:10%
international law to
the point to where

00:33:38.530 --> 00:33:41.650 align:middle line:10%
it would be capable of
coping with new situations

00:33:41.650 --> 00:33:44.740 align:middle line:10%
would compel us to make a
change in its structure,

00:33:44.740 --> 00:33:47.050 align:middle line:10%
a change so basic that
it would no longer be

00:33:47.050 --> 00:33:49.570 align:middle line:10%
international law,
that is to say,

00:33:49.570 --> 00:33:53.860 align:middle line:10%
as it is conceived today, but
something altogether different,

00:33:53.860 --> 00:33:57.370 align:middle line:10%
so that it could no
longer bear the same name.

00:33:57.370 --> 00:33:59.770 align:middle line:10%
If these intelligent
beings were in possession

00:33:59.770 --> 00:34:02.860 align:middle line:10%
of more or less culture,
and more or less perfect

00:34:02.860 --> 00:34:06.370 align:middle line:10%
political organization, they
would have an absolute right

00:34:06.370 --> 00:34:09.500 align:middle line:10%
to be recognized as independent
and sovereign peoples."

00:34:09.500 --> 00:34:15.850 align:middle line:90%


00:34:15.850 --> 00:34:19.150 align:middle line:10%
President Truman did not
agree to discuss the proposal

00:34:19.150 --> 00:34:21.170 align:middle line:10%
with Einstein and Oppenheimer.

00:34:21.170 --> 00:34:25.150 align:middle line:84%
However, it is clear that their
letter had a decisive influence

00:34:25.150 --> 00:34:30.170 align:middle line:84%
in declaring the UFO phenomenon
a matter of national security.

00:34:30.170 --> 00:34:33.010 align:middle line:84%
The considerations presented by
the scientists to the president

00:34:33.010 --> 00:34:35.409 align:middle line:84%
showed that accepting
this phenomenon

00:34:35.409 --> 00:34:38.560 align:middle line:84%
and giving rights to
extraterrestrial beings

00:34:38.560 --> 00:34:41.110 align:middle line:90%
was a very complex issue.

00:34:41.110 --> 00:34:44.469 align:middle line:10%
The otherworldly incident would
be buried in government files

00:34:44.469 --> 00:34:47.920 align:middle line:10%
and kept secret, or left
for future generations

00:34:47.920 --> 00:34:50.080 align:middle line:10%
to discover and
ascertain their meaning.

00:34:50.080 --> 00:34:55.415 align:middle line:90%

>> In the next
edition of "Nuevo,"

00:34:58.010 --> 00:35:02.330 align:middle line:84%
we will present an exclusive
interview with Remigio Baca,

00:35:02.330 --> 00:35:06.140 align:middle line:84%
the second witness who died
shortly after giving us that

00:35:06.140 --> 00:35:07.280 align:middle line:90%
interview.

00:35:07.280 --> 00:35:10.820 align:middle line:84%
We will present the object
that both Remigio Baca and Jose

00:35:10.820 --> 00:35:13.790 align:middle line:84%
Padilla recovered when
they were children,

00:35:13.790 --> 00:35:17.600 align:middle line:84%
and that has remained hidden
for more than 70 years.

00:35:17.600 --> 00:35:20.090 align:middle line:84%
I'm Jaime Maussan,
