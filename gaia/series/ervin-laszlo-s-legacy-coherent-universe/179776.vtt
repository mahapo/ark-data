00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:28.220 align:middle line:90%


00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:30.030 align:middle line:10%
>> In the beginning
of modern age,

00:00:30.030 --> 00:00:33.150 align:middle line:10%
it's a thought that
this solar system--

00:00:33.150 --> 00:00:37.080 align:middle line:10%
what we now know as the solar
system-- is all that was.

00:00:37.080 --> 00:00:38.430 align:middle line:10%
That's the whole universe.

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:42.150 align:middle line:10%
And if we come from anywhere,
we come from someplace

00:00:42.150 --> 00:00:44.280 align:middle line:10%
inside that universe.

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:47.880 align:middle line:84%
Then, by the time
of last century--

00:00:47.880 --> 00:00:50.010 align:middle line:90%
or the 19th Century--

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:53.810 align:middle line:84%
we knew that the solar
system is part of the galaxy.

00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:56.460 align:middle line:84%
But then, we saw that the
galaxy is all there is.

00:00:56.460 --> 00:00:57.930 align:middle line:90%
So we come from the galaxy.

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:01.200 align:middle line:84%
If we come from the universe,
we come from the galaxy.

00:01:01.200 --> 00:01:04.160 align:middle line:84%
Then, it turned out that
this is just one of millions

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:07.300 align:middle line:90%
of billions of galaxies.

00:01:07.300 --> 00:01:10.780 align:middle line:90%
So our vision is expanding.

00:01:10.780 --> 00:01:13.800 align:middle line:84%
Where we come from is
something far bigger,

00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:15.770 align:middle line:90%
far deeper than what we thought.

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:19.840 align:middle line:90%


00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:24.070 align:middle line:84%
Where do the stars come from
if we come from the stars?

00:01:24.070 --> 00:01:26.590 align:middle line:84%
We come from this
universe, but where

00:01:26.590 --> 00:01:28.720 align:middle line:90%
did this universe come from?

00:01:28.720 --> 00:01:32.870 align:middle line:84%
That is now the question that is
being discussed more and more.

00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:35.690 align:middle line:84%
This universe
wasn't there always.

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:37.550 align:middle line:90%
It came to be.

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:40.420 align:middle line:90%
It evolved.

00:01:40.420 --> 00:01:43.390 align:middle line:84%
Now, the universe
was born probably--

00:01:43.390 --> 00:01:45.880 align:middle line:84%
according to the
best guesses today--

00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:50.860 align:middle line:84%
at the time of the Big Bang,
80.3 billion years ago,

00:01:50.860 --> 00:01:53.170 align:middle line:90%
more or less.

00:01:53.170 --> 00:01:57.010 align:middle line:84%
And this cosmic event
gave birth to everything

00:01:57.010 --> 00:01:59.790 align:middle line:84%
that we can now observe
in the universe.

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:03.430 align:middle line:84%
It gave birth to the
observable universe.

00:02:03.430 --> 00:02:06.880 align:middle line:84%
Therefore, it gave birth
also to the seeds--

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:10.840 align:middle line:84%
to the predecessors--
of living things.

00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:14.650 align:middle line:84%
So if we came from anywhere,
he came from the universe

00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:17.050 align:middle line:90%
that was born in the Big Bang.

00:02:17.050 --> 00:02:22.300 align:middle line:84%
And out of that, chaos
then gradually distilled

00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:25.090 align:middle line:90%
what we know as the universe--

00:02:25.090 --> 00:02:28.400 align:middle line:84%
distilled what we know are
the things in the universe.

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:30.580 align:middle line:90%
So, also us.

00:02:30.580 --> 00:02:36.430 align:middle line:84%
Also, not us as we are now
but the origins of life.

00:02:36.430 --> 00:02:42.730 align:middle line:84%
The origins of everything--
planets, solar systems.

00:02:42.730 --> 00:02:45.130 align:middle line:84%
So if we ask, where
did we come from?

00:02:45.130 --> 00:02:49.440 align:middle line:84%
I would have to say, we come
from the deeper dimension which

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:55.350 align:middle line:84%
became, then, the explicate,
the known, the perceivable order

00:02:55.350 --> 00:02:58.020 align:middle line:90%
of the universe.

00:02:58.020 --> 00:03:00.470 align:middle line:84%
This deeper level is
known by various names--

00:03:00.470 --> 00:03:03.110 align:middle line:90%
the deeper dimension.

00:03:03.110 --> 00:03:07.220 align:middle line:84%
Some people call it the akashic
dimension or the akashic field

00:03:07.220 --> 00:03:10.730 align:middle line:84%
or a grand unified field
or the implicate order,

00:03:10.730 --> 00:03:12.142 align:middle line:90%
according to David Bohm.

00:03:12.142 --> 00:03:14.800 align:middle line:90%


00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:16.720 align:middle line:90%
We are children of the cosmos.

00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:20.980 align:middle line:90%


00:03:20.980 --> 00:03:24.380 align:middle line:84%
Now, this very interesting
question, then, our origin

00:03:24.380 --> 00:03:25.180 align:middle line:90%
truly--

00:03:25.180 --> 00:03:26.860 align:middle line:90%
if it reaches back--

00:03:26.860 --> 00:03:28.990 align:middle line:90%
are we truly alive?

00:03:28.990 --> 00:03:32.010 align:middle line:84%
Are we truly part of
the deeper dimension?

00:03:32.010 --> 00:03:35.570 align:middle line:84%
Is there discoverable
still in us?

00:03:35.570 --> 00:03:39.850 align:middle line:84%
Are we truly beings
of the cosmos?

00:03:39.850 --> 00:03:42.640 align:middle line:90%
And I think the answer is yes.

00:03:42.640 --> 00:03:48.280 align:middle line:84%
Because who we are is not
just what we've always been.

00:03:48.280 --> 00:03:51.190 align:middle line:90%
It is what we have become.

00:03:51.190 --> 00:03:54.100 align:middle line:84%
And this who we are,
what we will become,

00:03:54.100 --> 00:04:00.250 align:middle line:84%
is not just a body, but it's
also a mind, a consciousness.

00:04:00.250 --> 00:04:02.450 align:middle line:84%
And that consciousness
very probably

00:04:02.450 --> 00:04:06.320 align:middle line:84%
has its roots in that
deeper dimension--

00:04:06.320 --> 00:04:08.840 align:middle line:84%
the dimension that
gave rise to everything

00:04:08.840 --> 00:04:12.440 align:middle line:84%
that there is,
including the laws that

00:04:12.440 --> 00:04:14.780 align:middle line:90%
circulates what there is.

00:04:14.780 --> 00:04:18.620 align:middle line:84%
The laws of nature
about which scientists--

00:04:18.620 --> 00:04:20.890 align:middle line:90%
such as Einstein among them--

00:04:20.890 --> 00:04:23.870 align:middle line:84%
said that when we really
discover them and take them

00:04:23.870 --> 00:04:27.920 align:middle line:84%
seriously, we recognize
that there must

00:04:27.920 --> 00:04:29.960 align:middle line:90%
be at work a great spirit--

00:04:29.960 --> 00:04:34.190 align:middle line:84%
a great mind must be
behind these laws,

00:04:34.190 --> 00:04:36.710 align:middle line:90%
because they are coherent.

00:04:36.710 --> 00:04:42.090 align:middle line:84%
They create an observable,
intelligible universe.

00:04:42.090 --> 00:04:44.620 align:middle line:10%
We are part of that
intelligible universe,

00:04:44.620 --> 00:04:48.200 align:middle line:10%
and we have co-created
that universe

00:04:48.200 --> 00:04:51.200 align:middle line:10%
with the laws that were
born at the same time

00:04:51.200 --> 00:04:53.020 align:middle line:10%
that we were born.

00:04:53.020 --> 00:04:55.130 align:middle line:90%
When was this?

00:04:55.130 --> 00:04:57.020 align:middle line:84%
Now we enter the
deepest mysteries.

00:04:57.020 --> 00:05:01.880 align:middle line:84%
We can't say what was
there before the Big Bang.

00:05:01.880 --> 00:05:05.850 align:middle line:84%
Probably it was a
field of potentials--

00:05:05.850 --> 00:05:10.160 align:middle line:84%
a field where everything
that is possible to happen

00:05:10.160 --> 00:05:14.060 align:middle line:84%
could have its
happening possibility.

00:05:14.060 --> 00:05:17.660 align:middle line:84%
If there was anything
prior to the Big Bang,

00:05:17.660 --> 00:05:20.470 align:middle line:90%
it was as an intelligence.

00:05:20.470 --> 00:05:22.820 align:middle line:90%
It was a cosmic mind.

00:05:22.820 --> 00:05:27.080 align:middle line:84%
In Christian origins,
we talk about the word.

00:05:27.080 --> 00:05:29.660 align:middle line:84%
The word was, in the
beginning there was the word.

00:05:29.660 --> 00:05:32.010 align:middle line:90%
It was the logos.

00:05:32.010 --> 00:05:36.540 align:middle line:84%
In the Eastern religions,
the same idea crops up--

00:05:36.540 --> 00:05:40.280 align:middle line:84%
the intelligence, the
dao, whatever we call it.

00:05:40.280 --> 00:05:43.310 align:middle line:90%
The brahmin was there first.

00:05:43.310 --> 00:05:46.400 align:middle line:84%
And everything else
developed out of that.

00:05:46.400 --> 00:05:48.950 align:middle line:84%
You say now, am I
talking mysticism or am I

00:05:48.950 --> 00:05:50.990 align:middle line:90%
talking science?

00:05:50.990 --> 00:05:54.290 align:middle line:84%
I'm talking science
with its roots

00:05:54.290 --> 00:06:00.380 align:middle line:84%
on the same dimension from
where mysticism also stems.

00:06:00.380 --> 00:06:03.110 align:middle line:84%
This universe is
a mystic universe.

00:06:03.110 --> 00:06:04.520 align:middle line:90%
It's a miraculous universe.

00:06:04.520 --> 00:06:07.670 align:middle line:90%


00:06:07.670 --> 00:06:11.930 align:middle line:10%
Over 100 years ago, the
great astronomer James Jeans

00:06:11.930 --> 00:06:16.040 align:middle line:10%
said the universe
resembles a big thought

00:06:16.040 --> 00:06:18.950 align:middle line:10%
more than a big mechanism.

00:06:18.950 --> 00:06:21.710 align:middle line:84%
And sure enough, more
and more we investigate

00:06:21.710 --> 00:06:25.910 align:middle line:84%
the finest, the smallest
details, the deepest

00:06:25.910 --> 00:06:27.490 align:middle line:84%
elements of this
universe, the more

00:06:27.490 --> 00:06:33.020 align:middle line:84%
we find that it is more
like a great thought--

00:06:33.020 --> 00:06:37.980 align:middle line:84%
that it is information, that
it is something intelligible.

00:06:37.980 --> 00:06:40.490 align:middle line:84%
A very, very different
concept from what

00:06:40.490 --> 00:06:45.500 align:middle line:84%
there was 50 years ago, but
still is there in so-called

00:06:45.500 --> 00:06:47.330 align:middle line:84%
"mainstream science,"
much of what

00:06:47.330 --> 00:06:50.862 align:middle line:84%
is being taught today
in universities.

00:06:50.862 --> 00:06:53.370 align:middle line:84%
But if you really contemplate
this question-- who are we;

00:06:53.370 --> 00:06:54.950 align:middle line:90%
where we come from--

00:06:54.950 --> 00:06:57.440 align:middle line:84%
you must say we have
to go beyond that.

00:06:57.440 --> 00:07:00.730 align:middle line:84%
Because in the new
quantum sciences,

00:07:00.730 --> 00:07:04.310 align:middle line:84%
we recognize that what
there is in the world

00:07:04.310 --> 00:07:07.410 align:middle line:90%
is a quantum system.

00:07:07.410 --> 00:07:10.230 align:middle line:10%
The great scientist
Max Planck said,

00:07:10.230 --> 00:07:15.210 align:middle line:10%
after 40 years of studying,
the deepest elements

00:07:15.210 --> 00:07:17.910 align:middle line:10%
of this physical reality--

00:07:17.910 --> 00:07:19.950 align:middle line:10%
which means the atoms--

00:07:19.950 --> 00:07:22.950 align:middle line:10%
I can tell you one thing,
there is no such thing

00:07:22.950 --> 00:07:25.540 align:middle line:10%
as matter in the universe.

00:07:25.540 --> 00:07:27.010 align:middle line:90%
What is there?

00:07:27.010 --> 00:07:32.550 align:middle line:84%
He said, what there is
is a set of vibrations

00:07:32.550 --> 00:07:36.240 align:middle line:84%
that are held together
by a force that creates

00:07:36.240 --> 00:07:38.850 align:middle line:84%
the atom from the
atoms that created

00:07:38.850 --> 00:07:44.580 align:middle line:84%
the molecules, and the
supermolecular objects--

00:07:44.580 --> 00:07:47.830 align:middle line:84%
the many things that we can
observe, that we can touch--

00:07:47.830 --> 00:07:51.740 align:middle line:84%
and all of those
are finally sets

00:07:51.740 --> 00:07:54.990 align:middle line:90%
of vibration acting together.

00:07:54.990 --> 00:07:59.180 align:middle line:84%
And as Planck said, this force
that holds the atom together--

00:07:59.180 --> 00:08:00.860 align:middle line:90%
the proton and the neutron--

00:08:00.860 --> 00:08:04.260 align:middle line:84%
and then the electrons
that come into this--

00:08:04.260 --> 00:08:08.260 align:middle line:84%
that we must consider
as an intelligence--

00:08:08.260 --> 00:08:10.910 align:middle line:90%
a cosmic intelligence.

00:08:10.910 --> 00:08:13.970 align:middle line:84%
Wherever we look, however
we look at the world,

00:08:13.970 --> 00:08:20.000 align:middle line:84%
its origins are beyond
matter, beyond even energy

00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:22.990 align:middle line:90%
in a conventional form.

00:08:22.990 --> 00:08:25.460 align:middle line:90%
What are the origins then?

00:08:25.460 --> 00:08:27.950 align:middle line:84%
Where we come from
and, therefore,

00:08:27.950 --> 00:08:30.650 align:middle line:90%
indirectly, who we are--

00:08:30.650 --> 00:08:35.799 align:middle line:84%
the answer to that is
in formed vibration--

00:08:35.799 --> 00:08:40.909 align:middle line:84%
in formed energy-- energy
in the form of vibration.

00:08:40.909 --> 00:08:43.549 align:middle line:84%
Because when we examine
the smallest parts,

00:08:43.549 --> 00:08:45.440 align:middle line:90%
no matter is there.

00:08:45.440 --> 00:08:50.480 align:middle line:84%
What there is is vibration
of a given frequency,

00:08:50.480 --> 00:08:53.340 align:middle line:90%
phase, magnitude.

00:08:53.340 --> 00:08:56.420 align:middle line:84%
And these vibrations,
when they are in phase,

00:08:56.420 --> 00:08:58.520 align:middle line:90%
they create structures.

00:08:58.520 --> 00:09:03.430 align:middle line:84%
They create things that appear
as though they have a material.

00:09:03.430 --> 00:09:10.640 align:middle line:84%
So we are, ourselves,
clusters or sets of vibration

00:09:10.640 --> 00:09:15.251 align:middle line:84%
that appear as though we
were solid material bodies.

00:09:15.251 --> 00:09:17.360 align:middle line:90%
But we are more than that.

00:09:17.360 --> 00:09:19.300 align:middle line:90%
I simply call it, nowadays--

00:09:19.300 --> 00:09:21.440 align:middle line:84%
to give the simplest
possible term

00:09:21.440 --> 00:09:24.050 align:middle line:84%
that is acceptable to
modern science also--

00:09:24.050 --> 00:09:25.970 align:middle line:90%
I call it an attractor.

00:09:25.970 --> 00:09:29.450 align:middle line:84%
An attractor is something that
acts within a complex system

00:09:29.450 --> 00:09:32.160 align:middle line:84%
and makes it behave
in a certain way.

00:09:32.160 --> 00:09:34.130 align:middle line:84%
This universe is not
a random universe, not

00:09:34.130 --> 00:09:36.150 align:middle line:90%
a chance universe.

00:09:36.150 --> 00:09:38.840 align:middle line:84%
This attractor is
in the universe;

00:09:38.840 --> 00:09:41.000 align:middle line:90%
it's part of the universe.

00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:43.430 align:middle line:84%
At its deepest level
is the information

00:09:43.430 --> 00:09:48.830 align:middle line:84%
of the energy that makes up
this universe, makes what it is.

00:09:48.830 --> 00:09:52.670 align:middle line:84%
The universe is not
what you thought it was.

00:09:52.670 --> 00:09:54.270 align:middle line:90%
It's a quantum system.

00:09:54.270 --> 00:09:57.770 align:middle line:84%
More exactly, it's a
macroscopic, highly-integrated

00:09:57.770 --> 00:09:59.870 align:middle line:90%
quantum system.

00:09:59.870 --> 00:10:02.510 align:middle line:84%
What you're
recognizing now, that

00:10:02.510 --> 00:10:05.170 align:middle line:90%
in this remarkable universe--

00:10:05.170 --> 00:10:07.510 align:middle line:84%
a truly mysterious
universe that we

00:10:07.510 --> 00:10:10.760 align:middle line:90%
are decoding little by little--

00:10:10.760 --> 00:10:13.340 align:middle line:90%
that all things act together.

00:10:13.340 --> 00:10:15.970 align:middle line:90%
All things act as one.

00:10:15.970 --> 00:10:18.590 align:middle line:84%
What quantum
science teaches us--

00:10:18.590 --> 00:10:22.910 align:middle line:84%
any part of a quantum
system is not local.

00:10:22.910 --> 00:10:25.880 align:middle line:84%
It's also present
in every other part.

00:10:25.880 --> 00:10:28.250 align:middle line:90%
You can't act local.

00:10:28.250 --> 00:10:30.170 align:middle line:90%
There is nothing local.

00:10:30.170 --> 00:10:31.580 align:middle line:90%
No causality.

00:10:31.580 --> 00:10:36.530 align:middle line:84%
No push and pull, no
affect and cause is local.

00:10:36.530 --> 00:10:41.930 align:middle line:84%
Whatever you do is penetrating
throughout this system.

00:10:41.930 --> 00:10:45.625 align:middle line:84%
It's part of that system, and
we are part of the system.

00:10:45.625 --> 00:10:47.430 align:middle line:90%
How we come in --

00:10:47.430 --> 00:10:51.120 align:middle line:84%
think we come from beyond, it
can be very easily illustrated.

00:10:51.120 --> 00:10:55.980 align:middle line:84%
This beyond, where the
laws of nature reside--

00:10:55.980 --> 00:10:58.940 align:middle line:84%
that is something
like the laws--

00:10:58.940 --> 00:11:00.690 align:middle line:90%
the laws, let's say of a game--

00:11:00.690 --> 00:11:04.860 align:middle line:84%
laws of cards, laws
of chess or whatever.

00:11:04.860 --> 00:11:08.160 align:middle line:84%
These laws are given
and you play the game.

00:11:08.160 --> 00:11:10.100 align:middle line:90%
You don't play with the laws.

00:11:10.100 --> 00:11:11.580 align:middle line:90%
The laws are already given.

00:11:11.580 --> 00:11:14.610 align:middle line:84%
The laws just tell you
how you can play the game.

00:11:14.610 --> 00:11:16.620 align:middle line:84%
And they're the
same for the novice

00:11:16.620 --> 00:11:20.460 align:middle line:84%
and for the grand
master in chess.

00:11:20.460 --> 00:11:24.870 align:middle line:84%
The laws are what this
universe is fundamentally.

00:11:24.870 --> 00:11:26.560 align:middle line:90%
And it's not the game.

00:11:26.560 --> 00:11:28.740 align:middle line:90%
It's what governs the game.

00:11:28.740 --> 00:11:30.920 align:middle line:84%
So we talk about
the laws of nature,

00:11:30.920 --> 00:11:35.190 align:middle line:84%
we can no longer say that
they are part of the universe.

00:11:35.190 --> 00:11:35.990 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:11:35.990 --> 00:11:38.550 align:middle line:84%
They were there when
the universe was born;

00:11:38.550 --> 00:11:41.430 align:middle line:84%
and they will be there,
as far as we can tell,

00:11:41.430 --> 00:11:43.230 align:middle line:90%
when the universe will end.

00:11:43.230 --> 00:11:46.170 align:middle line:84%
Because that's also the
case that this universe

00:11:46.170 --> 00:11:50.970 align:middle line:84%
is not a permanent feature
of reality or the cosmos.

00:11:50.970 --> 00:11:54.170 align:middle line:84%
Because if there is one thing
we recognize more and more--

00:11:54.170 --> 00:11:57.370 align:middle line:84%
and this is also fairly recent,
surprisingly recent in science

00:11:57.370 --> 00:12:00.600 align:middle line:84%
also-- it's not recent in
religion and spirituality--

00:12:00.600 --> 00:12:04.100 align:middle line:84%
namely, the idea that
there is a higher will,

00:12:04.100 --> 00:12:08.520 align:middle line:84%
a higher intellect, that
governs the evolution of things

00:12:08.520 --> 00:12:10.800 align:middle line:84%
in the universe and of
the universe itself--

00:12:10.800 --> 00:12:13.120 align:middle line:90%
the structure itself.

00:12:13.120 --> 00:12:16.110 align:middle line:90%
It all hangs together.

00:12:16.110 --> 00:12:19.170 align:middle line:84%
And this evolution
is not random--

00:12:19.170 --> 00:12:21.750 align:middle line:84%
not just one darned
thing after another.

00:12:21.750 --> 00:12:24.450 align:middle line:84%
As philosophers used
to say not so long ago,

00:12:24.450 --> 00:12:27.330 align:middle line:84%
describe what the universe
really is, they would say,

00:12:27.330 --> 00:12:30.222 align:middle line:84%
it's just one darned
thing after another.

00:12:30.222 --> 00:12:35.070 align:middle line:84%
They're recognizing more that
the universe is progressing

00:12:35.070 --> 00:12:38.460 align:middle line:90%
from chaos to order.

00:12:38.460 --> 00:12:41.190 align:middle line:84%
And you're part of
this progression.

00:12:41.190 --> 00:12:43.560 align:middle line:84%
Our consciousness,
our body expresses

00:12:43.560 --> 00:12:46.300 align:middle line:90%
this in different ways.

00:12:46.300 --> 00:12:52.710 align:middle line:84%
We are part of an evolutionary
process that is nonrandom,

00:12:52.710 --> 00:12:56.730 align:middle line:84%
because we can go as far
as saying there is nothing

00:12:56.730 --> 00:12:59.290 align:middle line:90%
random in the universe.

00:12:59.290 --> 00:13:00.090 align:middle line:90%
Why?

00:13:00.090 --> 00:13:03.130 align:middle line:84%
Because there is nothing
disconnected from anything

00:13:03.130 --> 00:13:03.990 align:middle line:90%
in the universe.

00:13:03.990 --> 00:13:05.880 align:middle line:90%
It all hangs together.

00:13:05.880 --> 00:13:08.970 align:middle line:84%
Whatever you do
here and now also

00:13:08.970 --> 00:13:13.580 align:middle line:84%
affects everything
there and then.

00:13:13.580 --> 00:13:16.950 align:middle line:10%
So all this progress is--

00:13:16.950 --> 00:13:21.124 align:middle line:10%
to use a good term suggested
in a different context

00:13:21.124 --> 00:13:22.790 align:middle line:10%
by the great psychiatrist,
a good friend

00:13:22.790 --> 00:13:24.840 align:middle line:10%
of mine, Stanislav Grof--

00:13:24.840 --> 00:13:27.960 align:middle line:10%
he uses the term "holotropic."

00:13:27.960 --> 00:13:31.500 align:middle line:10%
"Holo" means oneness in Greek.

00:13:31.500 --> 00:13:33.500 align:middle line:90%
"Tropic" means tropicus.

00:13:33.500 --> 00:13:36.630 align:middle line:84%
Tropism means something
that you tend toward.

00:13:36.630 --> 00:13:39.210 align:middle line:84%
A fish, towards
food has a tropism.

00:13:39.210 --> 00:13:41.940 align:middle line:90%
Even bacteria has tropisms.

00:13:41.940 --> 00:13:45.030 align:middle line:84%
And, of course, our instincts--
everything that we are

00:13:45.030 --> 00:13:47.190 align:middle line:90%
has a tropistic element.

00:13:47.190 --> 00:13:51.750 align:middle line:84%
We are tending towards some
direction rather than another.

00:13:51.750 --> 00:13:53.310 align:middle line:90%
And so does the universe.

00:13:53.310 --> 00:13:58.230 align:middle line:84%
All of evolution is
holotropic in that sense.

00:13:58.230 --> 00:14:03.960 align:middle line:84%
All elements work together,
and they need to, as it were.

00:14:03.960 --> 00:14:07.140 align:middle line:84%
In human life-- in any
life, any living system--

00:14:07.140 --> 00:14:09.870 align:middle line:90%
they need to work together.

00:14:09.870 --> 00:14:13.380 align:middle line:84%
Because if they don't,
life is no longer capable.

00:14:13.380 --> 00:14:19.450 align:middle line:84%
Life is not possible except
in a quantum coherent system.

00:14:19.450 --> 00:14:22.330 align:middle line:84%
On the physical
level, the objective

00:14:22.330 --> 00:14:27.610 align:middle line:84%
is to maintain this system,
this living system that is us.

00:14:27.610 --> 00:14:31.320 align:middle line:84%
And if we are healthy,
if we are normal,

00:14:31.320 --> 00:14:33.040 align:middle line:90%
we are part of this drive.

00:14:33.040 --> 00:14:34.000 align:middle line:90%
We obey it.

00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:35.050 align:middle line:90%
We live it.

00:14:35.050 --> 00:14:37.750 align:middle line:90%
We express it.

00:14:37.750 --> 00:14:40.300 align:middle line:90%
Intuitive people express it.

00:14:40.300 --> 00:14:43.450 align:middle line:84%
So-called primitive cultures,
who are far from primitive,

00:14:43.450 --> 00:14:45.780 align:middle line:90%
they express it.

00:14:45.780 --> 00:14:46.870 align:middle line:90%
They knew it.

00:14:46.870 --> 00:14:51.120 align:middle line:84%
Animals know it without
being able to verbalize

00:14:51.120 --> 00:14:53.870 align:middle line:90%
it or conceptualize it.

00:14:53.870 --> 00:14:58.340 align:middle line:84%
And we, with our ability
to conceptualize,

00:14:58.340 --> 00:15:01.820 align:middle line:84%
to put together and
interpret things,

00:15:01.820 --> 00:15:06.540 align:middle line:84%
we are interpreting this drive,
and we are mis-apprehending--

00:15:06.540 --> 00:15:09.010 align:middle line:90%
misinterpreting it very often.

00:15:09.010 --> 00:15:14.670 align:middle line:84%
We're interpreting it as a
drive for power, for domination,

00:15:14.670 --> 00:15:17.680 align:middle line:90%
in the human world, for wealth.

00:15:17.680 --> 00:15:22.720 align:middle line:84%
We are interpreting it as
we first, our country first,

00:15:22.720 --> 00:15:24.270 align:middle line:90%
never mind the rest.

00:15:24.270 --> 00:15:28.000 align:middle line:84%
We are replacing this
inherent oneness,

00:15:28.000 --> 00:15:32.680 align:middle line:84%
which is there in the evolution
of all life in the universe--

00:15:32.680 --> 00:15:36.080 align:middle line:84%
we're interpreting
it as competition,

00:15:36.080 --> 00:15:39.440 align:middle line:90%
where the fittest survives.

00:15:39.440 --> 00:15:41.930 align:middle line:84%
This is not that
kind of a universe.

00:15:41.930 --> 00:15:44.170 align:middle line:90%
This is not this kind of nature.

00:15:44.170 --> 00:15:46.330 align:middle line:84%
Sure, there is
competition in nature.

00:15:46.330 --> 00:15:48.910 align:middle line:84%
There appears to
be also violence.

00:15:48.910 --> 00:15:51.700 align:middle line:84%
But it's always toward
a larger objective.

00:15:51.700 --> 00:15:54.910 align:middle line:84%
The deeper objective
in nature is always

00:15:54.910 --> 00:15:58.930 align:middle line:84%
the survival of a species,
the maintenance of the species

00:15:58.930 --> 00:16:00.740 align:middle line:90%
within that context.

00:16:00.740 --> 00:16:05.040 align:middle line:84%
And the context is always and
ultimately the web of life--

00:16:05.040 --> 00:16:08.120 align:middle line:84%
the system of life
on this planet.

00:16:08.120 --> 00:16:10.300 align:middle line:84%
And one day, I think
we will discover

00:16:10.300 --> 00:16:12.640 align:middle line:84%
that the system of
life on this planet

00:16:12.640 --> 00:16:15.310 align:middle line:84%
is part of a larger
system of life

00:16:15.310 --> 00:16:17.630 align:middle line:90%
elsewhere in this universe.

00:16:17.630 --> 00:16:20.350 align:middle line:84%
This will be an
incredible sophistry

00:16:20.350 --> 00:16:24.010 align:middle line:84%
to believe that we alone
possess intelligence,

00:16:24.010 --> 00:16:26.020 align:middle line:90%
we alone are living.

00:16:26.020 --> 00:16:30.970 align:middle line:84%
We are part of an
ongoing evolution of life

00:16:30.970 --> 00:16:34.160 align:middle line:84%
and of consciousness
in this universe.

00:16:34.160 --> 00:16:39.330 align:middle line:84%
To recognize it, that is
one great challenge for us.

00:16:39.330 --> 00:16:42.520 align:middle line:84%
And I mean recognize-- there's
a hyphen if you write it--

00:16:42.520 --> 00:16:44.260 align:middle line:90%
re-cognize.

00:16:44.260 --> 00:16:46.180 align:middle line:90%
Because we have cognized it--

00:16:46.180 --> 00:16:49.210 align:middle line:84%
classical cultures,
traditional cultures.

00:16:49.210 --> 00:16:51.700 align:middle line:84%
The Mystery Schools
have known this.

00:16:51.700 --> 00:16:56.260 align:middle line:84%
Now, we need to
re-cognize it on the basis

00:16:56.260 --> 00:16:58.390 align:middle line:90%
of scientific evidence.

00:16:58.390 --> 00:17:00.150 align:middle line:84%
And when we talk
about "new science,"

00:17:00.150 --> 00:17:01.690 align:middle line:90%
that's the new science.

00:17:01.690 --> 00:17:05.470 align:middle line:84%
New science is a science
of oneness and science

00:17:05.470 --> 00:17:10.540 align:middle line:84%
of striving together
toward a higher objective.

00:17:10.540 --> 00:17:15.160 align:middle line:84%
The big challenge is that
we, with our conscious mind,

00:17:15.160 --> 00:17:17.069 align:middle line:90%
we can mis-apprehend this.

00:17:17.069 --> 00:17:19.420 align:middle line:90%
We can misinterpret this.

00:17:19.420 --> 00:17:26.530 align:middle line:84%
We are free to develop valid
interpretations, valid ideas

00:17:26.530 --> 00:17:28.870 align:middle line:90%
based on our experience.

00:17:28.870 --> 00:17:32.770 align:middle line:84%
We are also free to
disregard those experiences,

00:17:32.770 --> 00:17:37.510 align:middle line:90%
free to misconstrue them.

00:17:37.510 --> 00:17:40.000 align:middle line:84%
It's a very
interesting phenomenon

00:17:40.000 --> 00:17:45.640 align:middle line:84%
that what we believe so
strongly influences what we see.

00:17:45.640 --> 00:17:50.770 align:middle line:84%
It used to be said that what
we see is what we believe.

00:17:50.770 --> 00:17:53.280 align:middle line:90%
We believe what we see.

00:17:53.280 --> 00:17:56.710 align:middle line:90%
Both ways it works, sure enough.

00:17:56.710 --> 00:18:00.700 align:middle line:84%
As a skeptic, we
believe what we see,

00:18:00.700 --> 00:18:04.570 align:middle line:84%
but also to recognize that
we see what we believe.

00:18:04.570 --> 00:18:07.510 align:middle line:84%
Because if we strongly
disbelieve something-- you say,

00:18:07.510 --> 00:18:10.550 align:middle line:84%
that's nonsense;
that cannot be--

00:18:10.550 --> 00:18:12.160 align:middle line:90%
you don't see it.

00:18:12.160 --> 00:18:14.320 align:middle line:84%
The evidence may be
there in front of us.

00:18:14.320 --> 00:18:18.340 align:middle line:84%
We don't see it or we
see it as something else.

00:18:18.340 --> 00:18:21.190 align:middle line:84%
It takes a long time
for something unfamiliar

00:18:21.190 --> 00:18:25.870 align:middle line:84%
to be built into something
that is familiar;

00:18:25.870 --> 00:18:30.310 align:middle line:84%
that if it has a deeper root,
accept that this information is

00:18:30.310 --> 00:18:35.620 align:middle line:84%
coming to us from that same
drive that is behind evolution.

00:18:35.620 --> 00:18:38.290 align:middle line:84%
Then, we can also
recognize things--

00:18:38.290 --> 00:18:41.726 align:middle line:84%
re-cognize things-- that
you otherwise disbelieve.

00:18:41.726 --> 00:18:50.160 align:middle line:90%


00:18:50.160 --> 00:18:54.610 align:middle line:10%
So there we are at the cusp
of an evolutionary process.

00:18:54.610 --> 00:18:58.320 align:middle line:84%
We built it up to a
point where it really

00:18:58.320 --> 00:19:01.960 align:middle line:84%
is in question whether
it can continue this way.

00:19:01.960 --> 00:19:05.170 align:middle line:90%
It has become unstable.

00:19:05.170 --> 00:19:09.660 align:middle line:10%
But instability is fine, because
without instability there

00:19:09.660 --> 00:19:12.740 align:middle line:10%
is no change, there
is no progress.

00:19:12.740 --> 00:19:15.360 align:middle line:10%
Things progress-- things move--

00:19:15.360 --> 00:19:19.290 align:middle line:10%
when the previous level
of being of that system

00:19:19.290 --> 00:19:21.720 align:middle line:10%
has become unstable, untenable.

00:19:21.720 --> 00:19:25.080 align:middle line:10%
Then we move, then we
search, then we finally find,

00:19:25.080 --> 00:19:27.940 align:middle line:10%
hopefully, or we disappear.

00:19:27.940 --> 00:19:31.750 align:middle line:84%
But if we survive, we
move on to something else.

00:19:31.750 --> 00:19:35.670 align:middle line:10%
And this cusp at which
we find ourselves

00:19:35.670 --> 00:19:42.240 align:middle line:10%
is precisely that
moment in history

00:19:42.240 --> 00:19:47.480 align:middle line:10%
where things either change
or they become extinct.

00:19:47.480 --> 00:19:52.070 align:middle line:84%
The great overwhelming majority
of species on this planet

00:19:52.070 --> 00:19:54.416 align:middle line:90%
have become extinct.

00:19:54.416 --> 00:19:58.340 align:middle line:10%
The human species
is not so old--

00:19:58.340 --> 00:20:00.890 align:middle line:10%
as a conscious
species, 50,000 years;

00:20:00.890 --> 00:20:03.570 align:middle line:10%
perhaps as a biological
species, maybe 3 million,

00:20:03.570 --> 00:20:06.490 align:middle line:10%
3.5 million years.

00:20:06.490 --> 00:20:10.040 align:middle line:84%
But as a conscious
species, able reason,

00:20:10.040 --> 00:20:13.220 align:middle line:84%
able to interpret
things, and therefore,

00:20:13.220 --> 00:20:17.900 align:middle line:84%
able to choose a
faulty direction,

00:20:17.900 --> 00:20:21.200 align:middle line:84%
that is recent, and is
the power that we now

00:20:21.200 --> 00:20:23.780 align:middle line:90%
have through technology.

00:20:23.780 --> 00:20:28.670 align:middle line:84%
We can implement our
poor interpretations.

00:20:28.670 --> 00:20:30.110 align:middle line:90%
A great danger.

00:20:30.110 --> 00:20:32.240 align:middle line:90%
Freedom is opportunity.

00:20:32.240 --> 00:20:34.620 align:middle line:90%
Freedom is the greatest value.

00:20:34.620 --> 00:20:38.450 align:middle line:84%
But it's also danger,
because opportunity

00:20:38.450 --> 00:20:43.740 align:middle line:84%
is to develop the good as
well as to develop the bad,

00:20:43.740 --> 00:20:46.910 align:middle line:90%
only if you go in on the issue.

00:20:46.910 --> 00:20:49.520 align:middle line:84%
Go back to the drive
that has created

00:20:49.520 --> 00:20:54.590 align:middle line:84%
this universe, which is living
in us, which is part of us.

00:20:54.590 --> 00:20:58.300 align:middle line:84%
Only if you do that do we
find the right interpretation,

00:20:58.300 --> 00:21:00.710 align:middle line:90%
do we find who we are.

00:21:00.710 --> 00:21:04.880 align:middle line:84%
I sound like a mystique perhaps,
but I can quote none other

00:21:04.880 --> 00:21:06.980 align:middle line:84%
than Erwin Schrodinger,
one of the greatest

00:21:06.980 --> 00:21:13.060 align:middle line:84%
physicists of our day, who
said, consciousness is one.

00:21:13.060 --> 00:21:15.570 align:middle line:84%
To use consciousness
in the plural

00:21:15.570 --> 00:21:19.310 align:middle line:84%
is misapprehend
it, to mistake it.

00:21:19.310 --> 00:21:21.620 align:middle line:84%
There is no sense in
which we can think

00:21:21.620 --> 00:21:24.260 align:middle line:90%
of consciousness in the plural.

00:21:24.260 --> 00:21:27.170 align:middle line:84%
Ultimately, there is
one consciousness.

00:21:27.170 --> 00:21:29.390 align:middle line:90%
And Einstein agreed.

00:21:29.390 --> 00:21:31.550 align:middle line:10%
He said, this is a kind
of an optical illusion

00:21:31.550 --> 00:21:35.150 align:middle line:10%
to think of consciousness
as residing severally

00:21:35.150 --> 00:21:37.830 align:middle line:10%
in each of us separately.

00:21:37.830 --> 00:21:41.600 align:middle line:84%
We are one
consciousness, one mind,

00:21:41.600 --> 00:21:48.500 align:middle line:84%
and that same mind stems from
this dimension which created

00:21:48.500 --> 00:21:50.990 align:middle line:90%
all things in the universe--

00:21:50.990 --> 00:21:58.850 align:middle line:84%
from the atoms to the amoeba to
the seeds of the simplest plant

00:21:58.850 --> 00:22:03.210 align:middle line:84%
to the algae to the
complex organisms

00:22:03.210 --> 00:22:07.670 align:middle line:84%
to societies of
organisms to ecosystems

00:22:07.670 --> 00:22:11.970 align:middle line:84%
to entire societies in our
global society of human beings.

00:22:11.970 --> 00:22:15.980 align:middle line:10%
It's all a product
of this drive--

00:22:15.980 --> 00:22:18.770 align:middle line:10%
drive towards oneness,
drive towards wholeness.

00:22:18.770 --> 00:22:21.570 align:middle line:90%


00:22:21.570 --> 00:22:24.840 align:middle line:84%
But if you now say
that these systems--

00:22:24.840 --> 00:22:27.750 align:middle line:84%
from the simplest to
the most complex--

00:22:27.750 --> 00:22:30.180 align:middle line:90%
also have a mental dimension--

00:22:30.180 --> 00:22:31.890 align:middle line:90%
a mental pull.

00:22:31.890 --> 00:22:34.910 align:middle line:10%
Again, the great philosopher
Alfred North Whitehead

00:22:34.910 --> 00:22:37.890 align:middle line:10%
talked about the physical
pull and the mental pull

00:22:37.890 --> 00:22:40.770 align:middle line:10%
of all the things which he
called the "actual entities."

00:22:40.770 --> 00:22:43.110 align:middle line:84%
All things are actual
entities, and they all

00:22:43.110 --> 00:22:45.300 align:middle line:90%
have a mental pull, as well.

00:22:45.300 --> 00:22:50.100 align:middle line:84%
Mysticism is the best guess
that we have in science

00:22:50.100 --> 00:22:53.070 align:middle line:90%
as to how our mind operates.

00:22:53.070 --> 00:22:57.360 align:middle line:84%
Our mind, it operates,
it's there, even when

00:22:57.360 --> 00:22:58.530 align:middle line:90%
the brain is turned off.

00:22:58.530 --> 00:23:01.707 align:middle line:90%


00:23:01.707 --> 00:23:02.540 align:middle line:90%
How do we know this?

00:23:02.540 --> 00:23:05.880 align:middle line:90%
The evidence is manifold today.

00:23:05.880 --> 00:23:09.840 align:middle line:84%
It's there in the near-death
experiences most explicitly,

00:23:09.840 --> 00:23:12.180 align:middle line:84%
because people who have
near-death experiences,

00:23:12.180 --> 00:23:14.430 align:middle line:84%
very often, they
are in hospitals

00:23:14.430 --> 00:23:17.850 align:middle line:84%
and they're hooked
up to instrumentation

00:23:17.850 --> 00:23:22.380 align:middle line:84%
that shows the waves of their
movement of their brain.

00:23:22.380 --> 00:23:24.540 align:middle line:90%
And there are periods--

00:23:24.540 --> 00:23:27.210 align:middle line:84%
not for everybody, obviously--
but there is very often--

00:23:27.210 --> 00:23:30.600 align:middle line:84%
many, many cases--
when this is flatlined.

00:23:30.600 --> 00:23:32.060 align:middle line:90%
The line is flat.

00:23:32.060 --> 00:23:37.740 align:middle line:10%
The brain doesn't operate
in any normal way.

00:23:37.740 --> 00:23:40.860 align:middle line:84%
And during this
period, the individuals

00:23:40.860 --> 00:23:43.470 align:middle line:84%
are in a given setting,
they're exposed

00:23:43.470 --> 00:23:47.220 align:middle line:84%
to sights and
sounds, happenings,

00:23:47.220 --> 00:23:48.340 align:middle line:90%
and then they come back.

00:23:48.340 --> 00:23:50.020 align:middle line:84%
And if they come
back-- not always,

00:23:50.020 --> 00:23:53.190 align:middle line:84%
but often they do come back
to normal functioning--

00:23:53.190 --> 00:23:55.740 align:middle line:84%
they describe in detail what
happened during the time

00:23:55.740 --> 00:23:58.660 align:middle line:90%
that their brain was flatlined.

00:23:58.660 --> 00:24:01.020 align:middle line:90%
How is that possible?

00:24:01.020 --> 00:24:03.090 align:middle line:84%
Today, even the
greatest skeptics

00:24:03.090 --> 00:24:07.380 align:middle line:84%
admit that this is
possible, not because they

00:24:07.380 --> 00:24:11.530 align:middle line:84%
are convinced by arguments
but because they lived it.

00:24:11.530 --> 00:24:15.090 align:middle line:10%
There was a case of a famous
Harvard neurosurgeon--

00:24:15.090 --> 00:24:23.186 align:middle line:10%
Eben Alexander-- who spent
seven days in deep coma,

00:24:23.186 --> 00:24:27.460 align:middle line:10%
where there was no possibility--
as he would have said before--

00:24:27.460 --> 00:24:31.510 align:middle line:10%
no possibility of any
conscious experience.

00:24:31.510 --> 00:24:32.970 align:middle line:10%
When he came back--

00:24:32.970 --> 00:24:36.340 align:middle line:10%
which was half of a miracle,
because he was given up

00:24:36.340 --> 00:24:38.860 align:middle line:10%
by standard medical science--

00:24:38.860 --> 00:24:42.940 align:middle line:10%
when he came back, he described
in detail what happened

00:24:42.940 --> 00:24:45.790 align:middle line:10%
in ways that are verifiable.

00:24:45.790 --> 00:24:51.100 align:middle line:84%
We are no longer entitled
to believe that all we are

00:24:51.100 --> 00:24:57.940 align:middle line:84%
is a series of brain functions
in the cerebellum, which

00:24:57.940 --> 00:25:01.840 align:middle line:84%
produce, as kind of a
byproduct, sensations.

00:25:01.840 --> 00:25:04.100 align:middle line:84%
And these sensations,
we call consciousness.

00:25:04.100 --> 00:25:07.780 align:middle line:84%
So when you turn off the
system, the sensations stop.

00:25:07.780 --> 00:25:10.980 align:middle line:84%
Sure enough, they stop,
but the sensations

00:25:10.980 --> 00:25:12.570 align:middle line:90%
may exist outside the brain.

00:25:12.570 --> 00:25:16.380 align:middle line:90%


00:25:16.380 --> 00:25:19.500 align:middle line:84%
Maybe the ancient
insight is true;

00:25:19.500 --> 00:25:22.890 align:middle line:84%
namely, that there
is life beyond.

00:25:22.890 --> 00:25:25.950 align:middle line:10%
Call it the "soul," call it the
"spirit," whatever we call it--

00:25:25.950 --> 00:25:28.990 align:middle line:10%
I prefer to call it
just a consciousness--

00:25:28.990 --> 00:25:33.710 align:middle line:10%
a cosmic consciousness--
which operates in us.

00:25:33.710 --> 00:25:38.110 align:middle line:84%
And we can explain this now
fairly well modern concepts.

00:25:38.110 --> 00:25:39.510 align:middle line:90%
Because think of it--

00:25:39.510 --> 00:25:43.540 align:middle line:84%
this cosmic consciousness
could be like a hologram.

00:25:43.540 --> 00:25:49.140 align:middle line:84%
A hologram is a system
of information such

00:25:49.140 --> 00:25:52.890 align:middle line:84%
that every part is represented
in every other part.

00:25:52.890 --> 00:25:55.030 align:middle line:84%
Because say that
in the hologram,

00:25:55.030 --> 00:25:58.340 align:middle line:84%
the totality of the information,
that creates the image.

00:25:58.340 --> 00:26:03.242 align:middle line:84%
Whatever the hologram is is
present in every small part.

00:26:03.242 --> 00:26:05.470 align:middle line:90%
And we can show this.

00:26:05.470 --> 00:26:08.420 align:middle line:84%
This is scientifically
proveable.

00:26:08.420 --> 00:26:10.650 align:middle line:84%
You don't have to have
a complete hologram.

00:26:10.650 --> 00:26:15.660 align:middle line:84%
It's enough to take a classical
projector-- a slide projector--

00:26:15.660 --> 00:26:18.080 align:middle line:84%
or anything that projects
an image, you see.

00:26:18.080 --> 00:26:20.340 align:middle line:90%
Take the lens out of it.

00:26:20.340 --> 00:26:23.550 align:middle line:84%
What you get then is what is
known as the optical arrays.

00:26:23.550 --> 00:26:27.120 align:middle line:84%
You don't see everything
because all of the elements

00:26:27.120 --> 00:26:30.930 align:middle line:84%
is present simultaneously
together on the screen

00:26:30.930 --> 00:26:32.730 align:middle line:84%
if you project it
toward the screen.

00:26:32.730 --> 00:26:36.690 align:middle line:84%
Then, you take off your glasses
and you hold the glasses

00:26:36.690 --> 00:26:38.740 align:middle line:90%
in front of the screen--

00:26:38.740 --> 00:26:41.600 align:middle line:90%
anywhere in front of the screen.

00:26:41.600 --> 00:26:44.940 align:middle line:84%
The total image appears
very small behind the glass

00:26:44.940 --> 00:26:46.560 align:middle line:90%
on the screen.

00:26:46.560 --> 00:26:49.630 align:middle line:84%
This is known as
distributed information.

00:26:49.630 --> 00:26:51.840 align:middle line:90%
Information is most local.

00:26:51.840 --> 00:26:54.240 align:middle line:84%
And we can say this cosmic
consciousness, which

00:26:54.240 --> 00:26:59.810 align:middle line:84%
is present in all of us,
is distributed information.

00:26:59.810 --> 00:27:04.670 align:middle line:84%
It is something that we
receive, we can decode.

00:27:04.670 --> 00:27:08.210 align:middle line:84%
What the brain does is
decodes it, it transmits it.

00:27:08.210 --> 00:27:10.870 align:middle line:90%
It makes it perceivable.

00:27:10.870 --> 00:27:17.090 align:middle line:84%
But doesn't just make it,
that consciousness is present.

00:27:17.090 --> 00:27:19.730 align:middle line:84%
So you might ask, so
is everything that we

00:27:19.730 --> 00:27:22.770 align:middle line:90%
perceive such a consciousness?

00:27:22.770 --> 00:27:23.570 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:27:23.570 --> 00:27:27.360 align:middle line:84%
Obviously, the inner
consciousness in our mind,

00:27:27.360 --> 00:27:31.880 align:middle line:84%
there are many elements
that come from the senses.

00:27:31.880 --> 00:27:34.780 align:middle line:90%
We see sights or we hear sounds.

00:27:34.780 --> 00:27:37.490 align:middle line:10%
We taste tastes, etc.

00:27:37.490 --> 00:27:43.280 align:middle line:84%
So our consciousness is filled
with sensory information.

00:27:43.280 --> 00:27:46.280 align:middle line:84%
The big mistake of
modern times was that we

00:27:46.280 --> 00:27:48.920 align:middle line:90%
saw that that's all there is.

00:27:48.920 --> 00:27:51.240 align:middle line:90%
There is more to it.

00:27:51.240 --> 00:27:55.240 align:middle line:84%
We all have experiences
that go beyond the senses.

00:27:55.240 --> 00:27:58.130 align:middle line:84%
They are called
transcendental experiences.

00:27:58.130 --> 00:28:02.990 align:middle line:84%
But there's a whole
school on transcendental,

00:28:02.990 --> 00:28:08.450 align:middle line:84%
transpersonal psychology
and psychiatry,

00:28:08.450 --> 00:28:12.590 align:middle line:84%
investigating in detail the
elements of consciousness that

00:28:12.590 --> 00:28:18.680 align:middle line:84%
cannot be derived from sensory
information conveyed from

00:28:18.680 --> 00:28:21.380 align:middle line:90%
the five senses to the brain.

00:28:21.380 --> 00:28:23.180 align:middle line:90%
There are things that happen--

00:28:23.180 --> 00:28:26.710 align:middle line:90%
near-death experience is one.

00:28:26.710 --> 00:28:31.040 align:middle line:84%
Out-of-body experiences
very frequent as well.

00:28:31.040 --> 00:28:34.850 align:middle line:84%
And there are
spontaneous intuitions.

00:28:34.850 --> 00:28:38.020 align:middle line:84%
You might ask, do I
have such intuitions?

00:28:38.020 --> 00:28:38.820 align:middle line:10%
I might say yes.

00:28:38.820 --> 00:28:41.030 align:middle line:10%
I am not I mystique.

00:28:41.030 --> 00:28:44.460 align:middle line:10%
I try to be a philosopher--
a philosopher of science.

00:28:44.460 --> 00:28:48.320 align:middle line:10%
But whether I like it or not,
I do have such experiences.

00:28:48.320 --> 00:28:52.360 align:middle line:84%
They appear in the form of
a spontaneous but otherwise

00:28:52.360 --> 00:28:54.890 align:middle line:90%
inexplicable guidance.

00:28:54.890 --> 00:28:57.630 align:middle line:84%
When I work on a problem,
when I work on something,

00:28:57.630 --> 00:29:00.650 align:middle line:84%
when I think about it,
when I write something,

00:29:00.650 --> 00:29:04.790 align:middle line:84%
work on something, I think about
it day or night, all the time.

00:29:04.790 --> 00:29:08.310 align:middle line:84%
And very often, ideas
come to the surface.

00:29:08.310 --> 00:29:12.155 align:middle line:84%
And these ideas are not
rational ideas, not sensory--

00:29:12.155 --> 00:29:15.750 align:middle line:90%
produced ideas.

00:29:15.750 --> 00:29:16.710 align:middle line:90%
They come.

00:29:16.710 --> 00:29:19.520 align:middle line:84%
They come very often in
these half conscious states

00:29:19.520 --> 00:29:22.830 align:middle line:90%
between sleep and awakeness--

00:29:22.830 --> 00:29:26.150 align:middle line:84%
awakening-- the
hypnogogic state.

00:29:26.150 --> 00:29:28.380 align:middle line:90%
They come meditation.

00:29:28.380 --> 00:29:31.220 align:middle line:84%
And this is not
inexplicable in the sense

00:29:31.220 --> 00:29:34.430 align:middle line:84%
if you are dealing with a
holographic consciousness

00:29:34.430 --> 00:29:37.520 align:middle line:90%
of which we are an expression.

00:29:37.520 --> 00:29:42.150 align:middle line:84%
Because then we are part of the
consciousness of other people.

00:29:42.150 --> 00:29:47.000 align:middle line:84%
We are part of the
consciousness of predecessors.

00:29:47.000 --> 00:29:50.060 align:middle line:84%
It's open whether we are part
of the experience of also

00:29:50.060 --> 00:29:52.760 align:middle line:90%
of people who come after us.

00:29:52.760 --> 00:29:55.660 align:middle line:84%
Because is the future
also part of the hologram?

00:29:55.660 --> 00:29:56.840 align:middle line:90%
I won't deal with that.

00:29:56.840 --> 00:29:58.680 align:middle line:90%
I don't know.

00:29:58.680 --> 00:30:00.930 align:middle line:90%
But I can say the past is.

00:30:00.930 --> 00:30:04.270 align:middle line:84%
The past is there
in the present.

00:30:04.270 --> 00:30:10.590 align:middle line:84%
And whatever happens to
us, it has been informed.

00:30:10.590 --> 00:30:13.070 align:middle line:84%
It's not the first time
we live in the sense

00:30:13.070 --> 00:30:16.790 align:middle line:84%
that the consciousness
that is operating in us

00:30:16.790 --> 00:30:20.240 align:middle line:84%
has been picking up information
from other existences

00:30:20.240 --> 00:30:22.140 align:middle line:90%
from other lives.

00:30:22.140 --> 00:30:26.940 align:middle line:84%
Whether it's literally us,
that's a moot question.

00:30:26.940 --> 00:30:29.870 align:middle line:84%
It's something
that we experience.

00:30:29.870 --> 00:30:30.950 align:middle line:90%
Who is us?

00:30:30.950 --> 00:30:33.840 align:middle line:84%
If you just say this
is limited to our body,

00:30:33.840 --> 00:30:37.800 align:middle line:84%
then it wasn't us, because this
body after awhile will be dead.

00:30:37.800 --> 00:30:41.720 align:middle line:84%
But if it's us in terms of the
consciousness that we possess,

00:30:41.720 --> 00:30:42.635 align:middle line:90%
then, yes.

00:30:42.635 --> 00:30:45.020 align:middle line:90%
Then we are the hologram.

00:30:45.020 --> 00:30:46.166 align:middle line:90%
We are part of it.

00:30:46.166 --> 00:30:49.360 align:middle line:90%


00:30:49.360 --> 00:30:54.310 align:middle line:84%
Because we have gone so far
now in ignoring this dimension

00:30:54.310 --> 00:30:57.185 align:middle line:84%
that we have created
tensions that

00:30:57.185 --> 00:31:00.550 align:middle line:84%
are leading to almost
critical instabilities

00:31:00.550 --> 00:31:03.970 align:middle line:90%
in the world around us.

00:31:03.970 --> 00:31:07.360 align:middle line:90%
The future is in our hands.

00:31:07.360 --> 00:31:13.100 align:middle line:84%
And the great fortunate lemma
to this statement is that

00:31:13.100 --> 00:31:18.460 align:middle line:84%
the "our" of which the future is
in the hands of-- this "our" is

00:31:18.460 --> 00:31:23.060 align:middle line:84%
a multidimensional,
deeply conscious being--

00:31:23.060 --> 00:31:28.585 align:middle line:84%
a being who can
be one in the way

00:31:28.585 --> 00:31:31.690 align:middle line:90%
that the system can operate.

00:31:31.690 --> 00:31:36.460 align:middle line:84%
Our Earth system cannot operate
as a plurality of conflicting

00:31:36.460 --> 00:31:37.840 align:middle line:90%
elements.

00:31:37.840 --> 00:31:40.450 align:middle line:84%
And that's what
we are doing now.

00:31:40.450 --> 00:31:43.330 align:middle line:84%
We cannot fight each other and
hope that somehow out of these

00:31:43.330 --> 00:31:46.480 align:middle line:84%
many conflicts something will
happen that will maintain

00:31:46.480 --> 00:31:47.940 align:middle line:90%
the system.

00:31:47.940 --> 00:31:52.210 align:middle line:84%
By "system," I don't mean
just energy and matter.

00:31:52.210 --> 00:31:56.290 align:middle line:84%
I mean it's also a set
of relationships that

00:31:56.290 --> 00:31:59.380 align:middle line:84%
makes the web of
life a global quantum

00:31:59.380 --> 00:32:03.120 align:middle line:84%
system on this planet,
where everybody can live,

00:32:03.120 --> 00:32:07.930 align:middle line:84%
where everybody has a chance
to develop, to evolve.

00:32:07.930 --> 00:32:13.160 align:middle line:84%
That's cause for becoming
one, for cooperating,

00:32:13.160 --> 00:32:15.440 align:middle line:90%
for acting as one.

00:32:15.440 --> 00:32:18.960 align:middle line:84%
And it is possible, because
our consciousness is one.

00:32:18.960 --> 00:32:22.690 align:middle line:10%
We can believe Carl Jung
who said the same thing

00:32:22.690 --> 00:32:25.790 align:middle line:10%
about the unus mundus, one
world, one consciousness

00:32:25.790 --> 00:32:27.590 align:middle line:10%
in the world.

00:32:27.590 --> 00:32:29.980 align:middle line:10%
So where did we
get the guidance?

00:32:29.980 --> 00:32:32.770 align:middle line:90%
We get it from us, from inside.

00:32:32.770 --> 00:32:33.860 align:middle line:90%
We have it there.

00:32:33.860 --> 00:32:36.760 align:middle line:84%
We wouldn't have survived
as individuals so far.

00:32:36.760 --> 00:32:39.210 align:middle line:90%
Every child has it.

00:32:39.210 --> 00:32:41.470 align:middle line:90%
As we said, every animal has it.

00:32:41.470 --> 00:32:44.110 align:middle line:90%
Every living thing has it.

00:32:44.110 --> 00:32:47.810 align:middle line:10%
We have disregarded
it, ignored it.

00:32:47.810 --> 00:32:53.530 align:middle line:84%
But now we know and the time
has come to take seriously

00:32:53.530 --> 00:32:57.160 align:middle line:84%
who we are, who we
really truly are--

00:32:57.160 --> 00:33:01.720 align:middle line:84%
a quantum system informed
by a quantum consciousness.

00:33:01.720 --> 00:33:03.740 align:middle line:90%
I know it sounds--

00:33:03.740 --> 00:33:06.010 align:middle line:90%
it sounds esoteric.

00:33:06.010 --> 00:33:08.510 align:middle line:90%
It sounds mysticist.

00:33:08.510 --> 00:33:13.000 align:middle line:84%
But if we interpret correctly
and deeply the findings that's

00:33:13.000 --> 00:33:17.840 align:middle line:84%
coming now from the cutting
edge sciences, sciences both

00:33:17.840 --> 00:33:23.050 align:middle line:84%
of the brain, of the universe,
of the physical domain,

00:33:23.050 --> 00:33:25.630 align:middle line:84%
of the biological
systems, all of this

00:33:25.630 --> 00:33:30.490 align:middle line:84%
tell us we are basically
quantum systems interacting

00:33:30.490 --> 00:33:32.920 align:middle line:84%
with each other
and being guided,

00:33:32.920 --> 00:33:38.140 align:middle line:84%
I think, being governed by
a holotropic consciousness.

00:33:38.140 --> 00:33:41.490 align:middle line:84%
That's my religion,
if you ask me.

00:33:41.490 --> 00:33:46.090 align:middle line:84%
And I'd say that this is not
religion in a classical sense.

00:33:46.090 --> 00:33:49.030 align:middle line:84%
It is close to some
Eastern religions--

00:33:49.030 --> 00:33:52.690 align:middle line:90%
close to Buddhism, to Taoism.

00:33:52.690 --> 00:33:56.380 align:middle line:84%
But it's close also
to the Old Testament.

00:33:56.380 --> 00:33:58.360 align:middle line:84%
And it's also close
to the teachings

00:33:58.360 --> 00:34:01.930 align:middle line:84%
of Jesus, who was
alternately teaching

00:34:01.930 --> 00:34:05.770 align:middle line:84%
love and oneness as the
goal, as the objective

00:34:05.770 --> 00:34:08.650 align:middle line:90%
of our earthly existence.

00:34:08.650 --> 00:34:14.179 align:middle line:84%
What we have to change is the
superficial interpretations,

00:34:14.179 --> 00:34:18.940 align:middle line:84%
the symbolic packages in which
these deep spiritual insights

00:34:18.940 --> 00:34:21.850 align:middle line:84%
have come down to
us and have become

00:34:21.850 --> 00:34:27.610 align:middle line:84%
part of a power hierarchy
in every organized religion.

00:34:27.610 --> 00:34:30.250 align:middle line:84%
We can go back
beyond the religions

00:34:30.250 --> 00:34:34.989 align:middle line:84%
and form a religion of our
own-- a spiritual community,

00:34:34.989 --> 00:34:38.830 align:middle line:84%
which is, at the same time,
a scientific community.

00:34:38.830 --> 00:34:43.449 align:middle line:84%
Authentic spirituality
stems from the same root

00:34:43.449 --> 00:34:46.030 align:middle line:90%
as deep science does.

00:34:46.030 --> 00:34:48.300 align:middle line:90%
The origins are there.

00:34:48.300 --> 00:34:52.900 align:middle line:84%
The great prophets are the
great religious leaders

00:34:52.900 --> 00:34:55.820 align:middle line:84%
and the great scientists,
great thinkers.

00:34:55.820 --> 00:34:57.760 align:middle line:90%
It's all one.

00:34:57.760 --> 00:35:03.550 align:middle line:10%
I was fortunate in coming
toward these insights

00:35:03.550 --> 00:35:07.180 align:middle line:10%
by having spent my childhood
as an artist, as a concert

00:35:07.180 --> 00:35:12.910 align:middle line:10%
pianist, having made my living,
actually, giving concerts

00:35:12.910 --> 00:35:15.370 align:middle line:10%
in public in all
parts of the world,

00:35:15.370 --> 00:35:17.770 align:middle line:10%
until I was in my mid-30s.

00:35:17.770 --> 00:35:21.160 align:middle line:84%
And the experience I
had on the concert stage

00:35:21.160 --> 00:35:24.420 align:middle line:84%
was a deep spiritual
experience--

00:35:24.420 --> 00:35:27.400 align:middle line:84%
is the experience of
what you could, today,

00:35:27.400 --> 00:35:29.260 align:middle line:90%
express with the word--

00:35:29.260 --> 00:35:30.850 align:middle line:84%
I know it's
controversial, but I know

00:35:30.850 --> 00:35:33.540 align:middle line:84%
it's very, very meaningful,
very appropriate.

00:35:33.540 --> 00:35:35.590 align:middle line:90%
The word is love.

00:35:35.590 --> 00:35:40.600 align:middle line:84%
The experience of love
for all things around me,

00:35:40.600 --> 00:35:45.250 align:middle line:84%
for creating a single
domain, a single sphere

00:35:45.250 --> 00:35:50.080 align:middle line:84%
of unconditional perpetual
love around with me.

00:35:50.080 --> 00:35:52.900 align:middle line:84%
That's when you're
really playing music.

00:35:52.900 --> 00:35:56.710 align:middle line:84%
That's when you're not
just following notes,

00:35:56.710 --> 00:35:58.250 align:middle line:90%
then you're harmonized.

00:35:58.250 --> 00:36:01.030 align:middle line:90%
They are one with the world.

00:36:01.030 --> 00:36:06.040 align:middle line:84%
And that experience stayed with
me as I left the concert stage.

00:36:06.040 --> 00:36:09.070 align:middle line:84%
And when I write,
I write and speak

00:36:09.070 --> 00:36:12.580 align:middle line:84%
on the basis of
scientific findings,

00:36:12.580 --> 00:36:14.500 align:middle line:90%
but I put them together--

00:36:14.500 --> 00:36:17.440 align:middle line:84%
I interpret them
in ways that also

00:36:17.440 --> 00:36:20.670 align:middle line:90%
correspond to my experience.

00:36:20.670 --> 00:36:24.150 align:middle line:84%
And that's the opportunity
that I want to pursue--

00:36:24.150 --> 00:36:29.880 align:middle line:84%
this opportunity of
bringing out to people

00:36:29.880 --> 00:36:37.680 align:middle line:84%
this insight that we have a
deeper eye, a deeper oneness.

00:36:37.680 --> 00:36:40.980 align:middle line:90%
And we are not alone.

00:36:40.980 --> 00:36:44.800 align:middle line:84%
We don't need to go to other
planets to find our community.

00:36:44.800 --> 00:36:46.540 align:middle line:90%
The community is here.

00:36:46.540 --> 00:36:49.440 align:middle line:90%
It's the community of all life.

00:36:49.440 --> 00:36:53.840 align:middle line:84%
And together, we can make
this a living community.

00:36:53.840 --> 00:36:56.970 align:middle line:84%
Because, today, we
need to transform.

We need to change.

00:36:58.670 --> 00:37:02.330 align:middle line:84%
The community that we

00:37:02.330 --> 00:37:06.400 align:middle line:84%
