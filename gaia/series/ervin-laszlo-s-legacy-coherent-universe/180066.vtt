00:00:28.090 --> 00:00:31.450 align:middle line:10%
>> We talked about
health, organic health.

00:00:31.450 --> 00:00:34.262 align:middle line:10%
Let's talk about
another kind of health.

00:00:34.262 --> 00:00:38.440 align:middle line:10%
You can call it social health,
ecological health, humanity

00:00:38.440 --> 00:00:40.100 align:middle line:10%
health, instead of
human being health,

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:45.280 align:middle line:10%
it's the same
thing, writ larger.

00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:52.110 align:middle line:10%
But whereas, in human health,
biological, individual health,

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:55.950 align:middle line:10%
there are things we can
do to turn to nature.

00:00:55.950 --> 00:00:59.070 align:middle line:10%
It's more difficult to do
it on the larger scale.

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:02.620 align:middle line:10%
On the larger scale,
we have to act.

00:01:02.620 --> 00:01:04.480 align:middle line:10%
It's up to us.

00:01:04.480 --> 00:01:08.410 align:middle line:84%
We cannot expect nature,
any larger system,

00:01:08.410 --> 00:01:13.150 align:middle line:84%
simply to come in and conduct
this, direct what we are doing.

00:01:13.150 --> 00:01:15.190 align:middle line:90%
We have to find the way.

00:01:15.190 --> 00:01:19.090 align:middle line:84%
Now, here are some guidelines
that we can discover.

00:01:19.090 --> 00:01:21.720 align:middle line:84%
And these guidelines
comes from coherence.

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:24.725 align:middle line:84%
More exactly, a
new term, which is

00:01:24.725 --> 00:01:26.350 align:middle line:84%
going to be more and
more popular, more

00:01:26.350 --> 00:01:30.370 align:middle line:84%
and more important,
which is super-coherence.

00:01:30.370 --> 00:01:34.630 align:middle line:10%
Coherence, in the classical way,
means that you have a system

00:01:34.630 --> 00:01:36.530 align:middle line:10%
and every part of
it is connected

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:37.820 align:middle line:10%
with every other part.

00:01:37.820 --> 00:01:41.110 align:middle line:84%
So what you do to one part
responds to the others.

00:01:41.110 --> 00:01:44.050 align:middle line:90%
And they together are coherent.

00:01:44.050 --> 00:01:49.630 align:middle line:84%
Super-coherence means that this
coherent system is coherently

00:01:49.630 --> 00:01:52.540 align:middle line:90%
related to other systems.

00:01:52.540 --> 00:01:56.560 align:middle line:84%
So the system formed by
all these coherent systems

00:01:56.560 --> 00:01:58.940 align:middle line:90%
is itself coherent.

00:01:58.940 --> 00:02:03.640 align:middle line:84%
Coherent is coherent
in the system.

00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:07.630 align:middle line:84%
Super-coherent means it's
coherent in the system

00:02:07.630 --> 00:02:10.960 align:middle line:84%
and between the system
and other systems.

00:02:10.960 --> 00:02:13.630 align:middle line:84%
When we talk about
health, normally we

00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:16.150 align:middle line:90%
mean internal coherence.

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:18.460 align:middle line:84%
But in super-coherence,
we have to talk

00:02:18.460 --> 00:02:23.150 align:middle line:84%
about internal coherence plus
external extrinsic coherence.

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:23.950 align:middle line:90%
Why?

00:02:23.950 --> 00:02:28.120 align:middle line:84%
Because we are also
part of a larger system.

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:33.160 align:middle line:84%
We are all ourselves, a dynamic
information-based quantum

00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:34.352 align:middle line:90%
system.

00:02:34.352 --> 00:02:38.470 align:middle line:84%
But we are also forming
such systems with others.

00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:41.230 align:middle line:84%
A family is already
such a system

00:02:41.230 --> 00:02:43.510 align:middle line:90%
on a level of several people.

00:02:43.510 --> 00:02:47.350 align:middle line:84%
Kinship systems, you
are producing together.

00:02:47.350 --> 00:02:52.550 align:middle line:84%
A community, a village,
a community of any kind

00:02:52.550 --> 00:02:56.680 align:middle line:84%
is already a larger system
of more people forming

00:02:56.680 --> 00:03:01.510 align:middle line:90%
such a common quantum system.

00:03:01.510 --> 00:03:05.220 align:middle line:84%
And these systems are
forming all the time.

00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:08.260 align:middle line:90%
They are all around us.

00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:09.310 align:middle line:90%
They are the economy.

00:03:09.310 --> 00:03:10.990 align:middle line:90%
They are society.

00:03:10.990 --> 00:03:12.880 align:middle line:90%
They are the culture.

00:03:12.880 --> 00:03:16.720 align:middle line:84%
They are every community
that we can think of.

00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:20.500 align:middle line:84%
Every village, every town,
every city, every region

00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:22.310 align:middle line:90%
is already a system.

00:03:22.310 --> 00:03:24.580 align:middle line:84%
Some are more
developed than others.

00:03:24.580 --> 00:03:26.800 align:middle line:84%
We can discuss it in
terms of integration.

00:03:26.800 --> 00:03:29.530 align:middle line:90%
How integral is such a system?

00:03:29.530 --> 00:03:31.270 align:middle line:90%
How well is it integrated?

00:03:31.270 --> 00:03:34.180 align:middle line:84%
So it's how well does
it hang together?

00:03:34.180 --> 00:03:37.640 align:middle line:90%
How stable or healthy is it?

00:03:37.640 --> 00:03:42.610 align:middle line:84%
Is not usual talk about health
in this social, socioeconomic,

00:03:42.610 --> 00:03:43.900 align:middle line:90%
sociocultural context.

00:03:43.900 --> 00:03:49.000 align:middle line:84%
But it is the same process,
writ large, as an individual.

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:54.010 align:middle line:84%
Now we are talking about how we
can jointly create and maintain

00:03:54.010 --> 00:03:57.280 align:middle line:90%
a healthy system on this planet.

00:03:57.280 --> 00:03:59.470 align:middle line:84%
And that healthy
system is one in which

00:03:59.470 --> 00:04:02.950 align:middle line:84%
every element can be in
touch and is in touch

00:04:02.950 --> 00:04:04.570 align:middle line:90%
with every other element.

00:04:04.570 --> 00:04:10.000 align:middle line:84%
And every element has what
it needs to live, to exist,

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:12.070 align:middle line:90%
and to develop.

00:04:12.070 --> 00:04:15.640 align:middle line:84%
The same as a cell in our
body, so an individual

00:04:15.640 --> 00:04:19.630 align:middle line:84%
in a social system needs
to be part of that system

00:04:19.630 --> 00:04:24.040 align:middle line:84%
and remain viable
within the system.

00:04:24.040 --> 00:04:27.350 align:middle line:90%
How to become super-coherent?

00:04:27.350 --> 00:04:30.040 align:middle line:84%
First of all, we
need to be healthy.

00:04:30.040 --> 00:04:33.290 align:middle line:84%
Obviously, if we are very
sick, we cannot contribute,

00:04:33.290 --> 00:04:36.430 align:middle line:84%
or, it's more difficult anyway
to contribute to the health

00:04:36.430 --> 00:04:41.200 align:middle line:84%
of the society, the
community in which we live.

00:04:41.200 --> 00:04:44.870 align:middle line:84%
Relatively healthy being
who can act, who can think,

00:04:44.870 --> 00:04:50.170 align:middle line:84%
who can be normal, can
be and must be healthy

00:04:50.170 --> 00:04:53.085 align:middle line:90%
contributing members of society.

00:04:53.085 --> 00:04:54.780 align:middle line:90%
This we know.

00:04:54.780 --> 00:04:57.100 align:middle line:90%
We have always been saying this.

00:04:57.100 --> 00:05:00.700 align:middle line:84%
But now another
consideration comes in.

00:05:00.700 --> 00:05:04.020 align:middle line:84%
This is not something that
would be good to have.

00:05:04.020 --> 00:05:07.870 align:middle line:84%
It's something that's
absolutely essential to have.

00:05:07.870 --> 00:05:10.530 align:middle line:84%
The discovery which dates
back a couple of decades,

00:05:10.530 --> 00:05:13.090 align:middle line:84%
and not really much
more than that,

00:05:13.090 --> 00:05:17.560 align:middle line:84%
is that these systems
are a particular kind

00:05:17.560 --> 00:05:24.810 align:middle line:84%
of holistic systems which are
called nondecomposable systems.

00:05:24.810 --> 00:05:29.000 align:middle line:84%
Decomposing a system
means taking it apart.

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:31.095 align:middle line:84%
Now, you can't take
apart a living system.

00:05:31.095 --> 00:05:33.380 align:middle line:90%
It will die.

00:05:33.380 --> 00:05:36.340 align:middle line:84%
We thought we can take
apart society and then

00:05:36.340 --> 00:05:39.730 align:middle line:84%
fix it if there something
wrong with it in any one part,

00:05:39.730 --> 00:05:43.180 align:middle line:84%
and then the whole
society will continue.

00:05:43.180 --> 00:05:46.940 align:middle line:84%
In some ways, it appears
that this goes like that.

00:05:46.940 --> 00:05:50.570 align:middle line:84%
But on the more basic
level on the longer term,

00:05:50.570 --> 00:05:55.180 align:middle line:84%
if you kill that society,
if you keep taking it apart,

00:05:55.180 --> 00:05:58.480 align:middle line:84%
and you only work on
the level of the part,

00:05:58.480 --> 00:06:02.830 align:middle line:84%
that overall system will
start to degenerate.

00:06:02.830 --> 00:06:05.680 align:middle line:84%
And think of what's
happening in the world today.

00:06:05.680 --> 00:06:08.750 align:middle line:84%
Doesn't this sound like
what's actually happening?

00:06:08.750 --> 00:06:13.510 align:middle line:84%
We are taking apart the system
that we can call human system.

00:06:13.510 --> 00:06:17.260 align:middle line:84%
The human biological,
socioeconomic, sociocultural

00:06:17.260 --> 00:06:20.720 align:middle line:84%
system on this planet
is being taken apart.

00:06:20.720 --> 00:06:24.700 align:middle line:84%
And a very good question whether
the individual human being

00:06:24.700 --> 00:06:29.620 align:middle line:84%
or populations, what level of
populations of human beings

00:06:29.620 --> 00:06:34.060 align:middle line:84%
can still survive when you've
taken apart the system.

00:06:34.060 --> 00:06:36.310 align:middle line:90%
The system's self-forming.

00:06:36.310 --> 00:06:40.470 align:middle line:84%
We have now formed a
global level system.

00:06:40.470 --> 00:06:44.880 align:middle line:84%
We no longer have the luxury
of just fixing some part of it.

00:06:44.880 --> 00:06:46.840 align:middle line:84%
We no longer have
the luxury of saying

00:06:46.840 --> 00:06:50.910 align:middle line:84%
this is what I'm interested in,
I don't care about the rest.

00:06:50.910 --> 00:06:54.100 align:middle line:84%
Yet, they think they can take
the most powerful system,

00:06:54.100 --> 00:06:58.370 align:middle line:84%
and if you say this is my
interest, never mind the rest,

00:06:58.370 --> 00:07:01.420 align:middle line:84%
sooner or later you will
suboptimize the system.

00:07:01.420 --> 00:07:04.310 align:middle line:84%
That means you are in favor of
some parts against the other.

00:07:04.310 --> 00:07:07.360 align:middle line:84%
The system will start
becoming unstable.

00:07:07.360 --> 00:07:09.000 align:middle line:90%
And it will come apart.

00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:12.114 align:middle line:84%
What is a stable component
of a human being?

00:07:12.114 --> 00:07:14.500 align:middle line:90%
When it dies?

00:07:14.500 --> 00:07:16.680 align:middle line:90%
Then the level of the cell.

00:07:16.680 --> 00:07:20.380 align:middle line:84%
The cell also dies but some
cells may survive for a while.

00:07:20.380 --> 00:07:23.420 align:middle line:84%
Then the molecule of those still
survived, then the molecule.

00:07:23.420 --> 00:07:27.670 align:middle line:84%
So a set of molecules, billions
of billions of molecules,

00:07:27.670 --> 00:07:30.470 align:middle line:84%
is not a living system,
not necessarily.

00:07:30.470 --> 00:07:34.120 align:middle line:84%
What makes it a living system
is the epigenetic guidance

00:07:34.120 --> 00:07:37.040 align:middle line:84%
to its genetic system
so that it becomes

00:07:37.040 --> 00:07:40.230 align:middle line:90%
a living and working whole.

00:07:40.230 --> 00:07:43.980 align:middle line:84%
Taking apart the society
to its components

00:07:43.980 --> 00:07:47.820 align:middle line:84%
will make it very difficult
for that component to live

00:07:47.820 --> 00:07:50.540 align:middle line:84%
and will make it
impossible sooner or later

00:07:50.540 --> 00:07:53.030 align:middle line:84%
for the other
components to survive.

00:07:53.030 --> 00:07:59.130 align:middle line:84%
The more powerful this action
of taking apart, the more it

00:07:59.130 --> 00:08:02.430 align:middle line:90%
endangers the entire system.

00:08:02.430 --> 00:08:08.330 align:middle line:84%
What has become clear is you
cannot live on this planet,

00:08:08.330 --> 00:08:12.630 align:middle line:84%
this nondecomposable
system in such a way,

00:08:12.630 --> 00:08:17.000 align:middle line:84%
that you only take care of
that system, any one system.

00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:19.470 align:middle line:84%
You have to take
care of all of it.

00:08:19.470 --> 00:08:21.830 align:middle line:90%
That's an old insight.

00:08:21.830 --> 00:08:25.500 align:middle line:84%
And the ancient cultures
talk about how we have to not

00:08:25.500 --> 00:08:29.580 align:middle line:90%
harm even a bird or a bug.

00:08:29.580 --> 00:08:31.620 align:middle line:84%
Anything that's
living is part of us.

00:08:31.620 --> 00:08:34.230 align:middle line:84%
And therefore, we have
to take care of it.

00:08:34.230 --> 00:08:37.049 align:middle line:84%
This insight is now
becoming very pragmatically

00:08:37.049 --> 00:08:41.169 align:middle line:84%
true, because we are in the
process of disintegrating,

00:08:41.169 --> 00:08:45.910 align:middle line:84%
decomposing the human
system on this planet.

00:08:45.910 --> 00:08:48.880 align:middle line:84%
We are creating, whether
we know it or not,

00:08:48.880 --> 00:08:53.700 align:middle line:84%
we are creating a new
level of a quantum system,

00:08:53.700 --> 00:08:57.870 align:middle line:84%
an integrated,
interwoven, jointly,

00:08:57.870 --> 00:09:00.780 align:middle line:84%
non-local quantum
system which is

00:09:00.780 --> 00:09:05.980 align:middle line:84%
the level of humanity as part of
the web of life on this planet.

00:09:05.980 --> 00:09:07.620 align:middle line:90%
It's one system.

00:09:07.620 --> 00:09:11.520 align:middle line:84%
Humanity has now become a
very major factor in it.

00:09:11.520 --> 00:09:15.310 align:middle line:84%
It conducts the
well-being of that system,

00:09:15.310 --> 00:09:19.950 align:middle line:84%
because this system is now
at a point of a bifurcation.

00:09:19.950 --> 00:09:23.490 align:middle line:84%
What we mean by that, it
can go this way or that,

00:09:23.490 --> 00:09:27.000 align:middle line:84%
but it cannot stay
the way it is.

00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:33.360 align:middle line:84%
So this cusp, this level, of
a critical bifurcation calls

00:09:33.360 --> 00:09:36.390 align:middle line:84%
for some conscious
considerations,

00:09:36.390 --> 00:09:40.140 align:middle line:84%
calls for consciously
changing the way we operate.

00:09:40.140 --> 00:09:48.450 align:middle line:84%
Moving from this decomposed,
artificially segregated level

00:09:48.450 --> 00:09:51.630 align:middle line:84%
to a more whole
systemic thinking

00:09:51.630 --> 00:09:54.900 align:middle line:90%
and acting in our interest.

00:09:54.900 --> 00:09:59.850 align:middle line:84%
Because if there is a mosquito
is missing in this Earth,

00:09:59.850 --> 00:10:02.640 align:middle line:84%
if there is a rhinoceros
missing in this Earth,

00:10:02.640 --> 00:10:05.990 align:middle line:84%
the rest of the balance
of life is threatened.

00:10:05.990 --> 00:10:10.680 align:middle line:84%
And if any one part of the
human community is dying out,

00:10:10.680 --> 00:10:14.310 align:middle line:84%
that's a threat to all the
other parts that are still

00:10:14.310 --> 00:10:17.280 align:middle line:84%
appear to be surviving,
but no longer

00:10:17.280 --> 00:10:21.890 align:middle line:84%
surviving with the balances
that it needs for life.

00:10:21.890 --> 00:10:25.880 align:middle line:84%
The entire conduct
of life today is

00:10:25.880 --> 00:10:30.450 align:middle line:84%
based on power, praise
for it's economic power,

00:10:30.450 --> 00:10:35.360 align:middle line:84%
political power,
financial power.

00:10:35.360 --> 00:10:39.830 align:middle line:84%
It's all based on
concentration of power

00:10:39.830 --> 00:10:44.050 align:middle line:84%
in favor of those who wield
the power, who possess it.

00:10:44.050 --> 00:10:46.970 align:middle line:90%
What does this mean in practice?

00:10:46.970 --> 00:10:48.890 align:middle line:90%
In practice at several levels--

00:10:48.890 --> 00:10:51.860 align:middle line:84%
because think of the highest
political level for example,

00:10:51.860 --> 00:10:55.810 align:middle line:84%
and then on the lowest level
of what I do, what you do.

00:10:55.810 --> 00:10:57.510 align:middle line:84%
On the highest level--
and term higher,

00:10:57.510 --> 00:11:01.350 align:middle line:84%
I mean in terms of the
most encompassing level--

00:11:01.350 --> 00:11:07.790 align:middle line:84%
it means that to beat your
swords into plowshares,

00:11:07.790 --> 00:11:13.400 align:middle line:84%
as it still says on a statue
in front of the United Nations.

00:11:13.400 --> 00:11:18.500 align:middle line:84%
Work together, yes,
not fight each other.

00:11:18.500 --> 00:11:24.140 align:middle line:84%
If there is something doesn't
work, the way to fix it

00:11:24.140 --> 00:11:27.530 align:middle line:84%
is the way to fix the
cells, by reprogramming.

00:11:27.530 --> 00:11:30.770 align:middle line:84%
Not artificially brainwashing,
I don't mean that.

00:11:30.770 --> 00:11:35.450 align:middle line:84%
I mean by thinking, education,
coming to new insights,

00:11:35.450 --> 00:11:38.540 align:middle line:84%
coming to new
considerations, understanding

00:11:38.540 --> 00:11:43.940 align:middle line:84%
that I need you and I need
the third person for myself.

00:11:43.940 --> 00:11:45.560 align:middle line:90%
You are a part of me.

00:11:45.560 --> 00:11:49.940 align:middle line:84%
And this consideration, coming
from the quantum sciences,

00:11:49.940 --> 00:11:52.930 align:middle line:90%
has very practical implications.

00:11:52.930 --> 00:12:00.890 align:middle line:84%
I cannot promote my well being
without promoting also yours.

00:12:00.890 --> 00:12:04.590 align:middle line:84%
Together we can make it,
but only by together,

00:12:04.590 --> 00:12:06.120 align:middle line:90%
being together.

00:12:06.120 --> 00:12:10.020 align:middle line:84%
And the key term here
is now corporation.

00:12:10.020 --> 00:12:11.420 align:middle line:90%
It has to replace--

00:12:11.420 --> 00:12:15.740 align:middle line:84%
not completely replace-- but in
large part replace competition.

00:12:15.740 --> 00:12:20.270 align:middle line:84%
Competition is good as long
as it aims to a common goal

00:12:20.270 --> 00:12:25.040 align:middle line:84%
and objective, which means
that it results in the better

00:12:25.040 --> 00:12:30.350 align:middle line:84%
life, in the wellness, of the
group of which competition

00:12:30.350 --> 00:12:33.470 align:middle line:84%
is a part, in which
competition is occurring.

00:12:33.470 --> 00:12:38.510 align:middle line:84%
Competition which kills the
competitors and all it favors

00:12:38.510 --> 00:12:43.070 align:middle line:84%
is strongest, old Darwinian
concept of competition,

00:12:43.070 --> 00:12:45.930 align:middle line:90%
that is today suicidal.

00:12:45.930 --> 00:12:48.380 align:middle line:90%
It kills the entire system.

00:12:48.380 --> 00:12:53.930 align:middle line:84%
Interestingly enough, the last
few decades, population biology

00:12:53.930 --> 00:12:56.990 align:middle line:84%
and ecobiology have
come up with the notion

00:12:56.990 --> 00:13:00.710 align:middle line:84%
that even when there seemed
to be competition and conflict

00:13:00.710 --> 00:13:04.700 align:middle line:84%
and violence, it's always
part of a food chain, part

00:13:04.700 --> 00:13:07.460 align:middle line:84%
of a system, in which
the overall system,

00:13:07.460 --> 00:13:14.270 align:middle line:84%
the total system is what is
survival, what stays there.

00:13:14.270 --> 00:13:17.420 align:middle line:84%
Within that system,
there are changes.

00:13:17.420 --> 00:13:19.796 align:middle line:84%
Always in the
classical civilization,

00:13:19.796 --> 00:13:21.170 align:middle line:84%
we have known
there was conflict.

00:13:21.170 --> 00:13:22.710 align:middle line:90%
There was warfare.

00:13:22.710 --> 00:13:26.850 align:middle line:84%
But the civilizations as a
whole were not threatened.

00:13:26.850 --> 00:13:29.490 align:middle line:84%
Some civilizations
that could not

00:13:29.490 --> 00:13:31.890 align:middle line:84%
learn this, that
could not learn how

00:13:31.890 --> 00:13:33.960 align:middle line:90%
to distribute their resources--

00:13:33.960 --> 00:13:38.680 align:middle line:84%
like Easter Island, for
example, or some of the violent,

00:13:38.680 --> 00:13:43.350 align:middle line:84%
the great Mongolian
Tatars moving into Europe

00:13:43.350 --> 00:13:46.480 align:middle line:84%
and killing, even
the Huns of Attila--

00:13:46.480 --> 00:13:52.560 align:middle line:84%
these civilizations were not
communicative, cooperative

00:13:52.560 --> 00:13:54.780 align:middle line:90%
civilizations.

00:13:54.780 --> 00:13:57.130 align:middle line:84%
But we can't afford
to have those anymore.

00:13:57.130 --> 00:13:59.070 align:middle line:84%
We live on a finite
planet where we

00:13:59.070 --> 00:14:01.440 align:middle line:84%
are fully dependent
for our life,

00:14:01.440 --> 00:14:04.230 align:middle line:84%
for our well-being
on each other,

00:14:04.230 --> 00:14:08.880 align:middle line:84%
for life can survive
together and not in part.

00:14:08.880 --> 00:14:12.000 align:middle line:84%
So on the highest level,
we have to understand

00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:16.260 align:middle line:84%
cooperate, move together,
don't remove yourself

00:14:16.260 --> 00:14:19.090 align:middle line:90%
from the seeds of cooperation.

00:14:19.090 --> 00:14:23.450 align:middle line:84%
Even if it looks good in the
short term, in the long term,

00:14:23.450 --> 00:14:25.010 align:middle line:90%
we won't make it well.

00:14:25.010 --> 00:14:26.400 align:middle line:90%
You won't do it.

00:14:26.400 --> 00:14:30.340 align:middle line:84%
You won't be able to survive
with limited resources

00:14:30.340 --> 00:14:32.820 align:middle line:84%
and with many claims
on those resources

00:14:32.820 --> 00:14:36.480 align:middle line:84%
unless you involve
others as well.

00:14:36.480 --> 00:14:39.720 align:middle line:84%
A different concept than
the current concepts

00:14:39.720 --> 00:14:43.160 align:middle line:84%
in many parts of the world,
we can't build walls anymore.

00:14:43.160 --> 00:14:46.110 align:middle line:84%
How ridiculous,
childish, it seems,

00:14:46.110 --> 00:14:49.530 align:middle line:84%
that's when we as
a flow of people,

00:14:49.530 --> 00:14:52.350 align:middle line:84%
which is a part of this
flow of information,

00:14:52.350 --> 00:14:56.740 align:middle line:84%
which is a consequence of the
flawed flow of information.

00:14:56.740 --> 00:15:00.510 align:middle line:84%
Then we try, instead of
readjusting the information

00:15:00.510 --> 00:15:08.580 align:middle line:84%
flow, we put up a wall or we
kill if nothing else helps.

00:15:08.580 --> 00:15:12.460 align:middle line:84%
Totally different
philosophies needed today.

00:15:12.460 --> 00:15:15.910 align:middle line:84%
So on the highest
level, cooperation.

00:15:15.910 --> 00:15:19.480 align:middle line:84%
On the lower levels
of communities,

00:15:19.480 --> 00:15:27.800 align:middle line:84%
and congregations, groups
of people who live together,

00:15:27.800 --> 00:15:30.060 align:middle line:84%
we have to pay
attention to the fact

00:15:30.060 --> 00:15:34.970 align:middle line:84%
that we are embedded
in larger systems.

00:15:34.970 --> 00:15:40.370 align:middle line:84%
Can we, on that lower level,
make a meaningful difference?

00:15:40.370 --> 00:15:41.230 align:middle line:90%
I think we can.

00:15:41.230 --> 00:15:46.140 align:middle line:84%
We can because there is
a paradoxical feature.

00:15:46.140 --> 00:15:51.940 align:middle line:84%
The weaker the overall
system, the more we can act.

00:15:51.940 --> 00:15:55.480 align:middle line:84%
As long as the highest level
system, the most encompassing

00:15:55.480 --> 00:15:59.860 align:middle line:84%
system is strong, it's
powerful, it has resistance,

00:15:59.860 --> 00:16:01.360 align:middle line:90%
you can't interact with it.

00:16:01.360 --> 00:16:02.710 align:middle line:90%
It defends itself.

00:16:02.710 --> 00:16:06.040 align:middle line:84%
It protects itself
from any change.

00:16:06.040 --> 00:16:09.550 align:middle line:84%
You can't change a
powerful hierarchy.

00:16:09.550 --> 00:16:15.160 align:middle line:84%
You can only change systems
that have an opening to change

00:16:15.160 --> 00:16:18.910 align:middle line:84%
and that are in a process
of change themselves.

00:16:18.910 --> 00:16:21.070 align:middle line:84%
The change can be
toward a hierarchy

00:16:21.070 --> 00:16:26.170 align:middle line:84%
or can be towards wholeness, a
wholearchy as it's also called.

00:16:26.170 --> 00:16:29.710 align:middle line:84%
It can be toward
good and toward bad.

00:16:29.710 --> 00:16:32.770 align:middle line:84%
To guide this process
of change is necessary.

00:16:32.770 --> 00:16:37.060 align:middle line:84%
And we can, we can,
because the overall system

00:16:37.060 --> 00:16:43.170 align:middle line:84%
within which we operate is now
becoming critically unstable.

00:16:43.170 --> 00:16:45.650 align:middle line:90%
So it is really open to change.

00:16:45.650 --> 00:16:49.400 align:middle line:84%
This brings forth the whole
notion of a critical mass.

00:16:49.400 --> 00:16:52.710 align:middle line:10%
You know, the great
anthropologist Margaret Mead

00:16:52.710 --> 00:16:55.770 align:middle line:10%
said never doubt the power
of a small group of people

00:16:55.770 --> 00:16:58.070 align:middle line:10%
to change the world.

00:16:58.070 --> 00:17:00.730 align:middle line:84%
And she added nothing
else ever did.

00:17:00.730 --> 00:17:03.270 align:middle line:84%
But we ought to add to
this that this is true.

00:17:03.270 --> 00:17:06.530 align:middle line:84%
But we also have to say that
this small group of people

00:17:06.530 --> 00:17:10.430 align:middle line:84%
have to operate in
an unstable system.

00:17:10.430 --> 00:17:14.060 align:middle line:84%
That means the critical
mass is a variable mass.

00:17:14.060 --> 00:17:14.930 align:middle line:90%
It's not the same.

00:17:14.930 --> 00:17:18.020 align:middle line:84%
People ask what is the
critical mass that you

00:17:18.020 --> 00:17:20.130 align:middle line:90%
need to really create change?

00:17:20.130 --> 00:17:22.440 align:middle line:90%
The answer is it depends.

00:17:22.440 --> 00:17:26.099 align:middle line:84%
It depends on the overall system
within which they operate.

00:17:26.099 --> 00:17:31.640 align:middle line:84%
If it's a hierarchy bolstered
by a high disciplined system

00:17:31.640 --> 00:17:36.440 align:middle line:84%
with strong weapons,
OK, then it takes a lot,

00:17:36.440 --> 00:17:40.100 align:middle line:84%
because then the smaller
groups of people try to change,

00:17:40.100 --> 00:17:42.260 align:middle line:90%
they will be put in prison.

00:17:42.260 --> 00:17:46.250 align:middle line:84%
They will be killed
if they don't resist.

00:17:46.250 --> 00:17:50.380 align:middle line:84%
But if a system is
open, like the regime

00:17:50.380 --> 00:17:52.690 align:middle line:84%
into which Castro,
for example, appeared,

00:17:52.690 --> 00:17:57.310 align:middle line:90%
like the empire of Germany.

00:17:57.310 --> 00:18:03.970 align:middle line:84%
Well, when these are breaking
down, then you can change.

00:18:03.970 --> 00:18:06.070 align:middle line:84%
Then you can bring
in something new.

00:18:06.070 --> 00:18:10.300 align:middle line:84%
When Tsarist Russia became
internally unstable,

00:18:10.300 --> 00:18:14.490 align:middle line:84%
then you could bring in a small
group of people moving in.

00:18:14.490 --> 00:18:17.720 align:middle line:84%
Lenin and his followers claiming
that they are the majority--

00:18:17.720 --> 00:18:19.105 align:middle line:84%
they were not,
actually, but they

00:18:19.105 --> 00:18:22.960 align:middle line:90%
said so-- to gain credibility.

00:18:22.960 --> 00:18:25.930 align:middle line:84%
And they managed to break
open this incredibly

00:18:25.930 --> 00:18:31.000 align:middle line:84%
large and long-term
Tsarist system.

00:18:31.000 --> 00:18:31.800 align:middle line:90%
It depends.

00:18:31.800 --> 00:18:35.700 align:middle line:84%
Critical mass depends
on where you operate.

00:18:35.700 --> 00:18:39.600 align:middle line:84%
Now, the good news is
that we now no longer need

00:18:39.600 --> 00:18:41.610 align:middle line:90%
a large critical mass.

00:18:41.610 --> 00:18:44.460 align:middle line:84%
The system has
become so unstable

00:18:44.460 --> 00:18:48.360 align:middle line:84%
that even small groups
of people can change it.

00:18:48.360 --> 00:18:50.520 align:middle line:90%
The system is interdependent.

00:18:50.520 --> 00:18:52.800 align:middle line:90%
And it runs on information.

00:18:52.800 --> 00:18:57.660 align:middle line:84%
What you need is no
longer weapons, not guns.

00:18:57.660 --> 00:19:02.285 align:middle line:84%
What you need is the key
ideas that become powerful.

00:19:02.285 --> 00:19:03.285 align:middle line:10%
Nothing is as powerful--

00:19:03.285 --> 00:19:05.520 align:middle line:10%
I think Victor Hugo
said that nothing

00:19:05.520 --> 00:19:10.650 align:middle line:10%
is as powerful as an
idea whose time has come.

00:19:10.650 --> 00:19:13.540 align:middle line:10%
We have seen that
over and over again.

00:19:13.540 --> 00:19:17.730 align:middle line:84%
The challenge is to live
with the right ideas,

00:19:17.730 --> 00:19:20.160 align:middle line:84%
be committed to
the right concepts,

00:19:20.160 --> 00:19:23.650 align:middle line:90%
and then let it spread.

00:19:23.650 --> 00:19:28.680 align:middle line:10%
Another great insight
is from that of Gandhi.

00:19:28.680 --> 00:19:32.170 align:middle line:10%
Gandhi managed to change
the powerful British empire

00:19:32.170 --> 00:19:33.970 align:middle line:10%
in India.

00:19:33.970 --> 00:19:37.570 align:middle line:84%
It fell apart in
India and was replaced

00:19:37.570 --> 00:19:41.800 align:middle line:84%
by an Indian regime which was
much more humanistic, much

00:19:41.800 --> 00:19:44.050 align:middle line:90%
more distributed.

00:19:44.050 --> 00:19:45.350 align:middle line:90%
Just by ideas.

00:19:45.350 --> 00:19:48.280 align:middle line:84%
He never picked up
a gun in his life.

00:19:48.280 --> 00:19:49.710 align:middle line:90%
He wasn't even dressed.

00:19:49.710 --> 00:19:53.810 align:middle line:84%
He was just there in his poor
clothes sitting on his mat.

00:19:53.810 --> 00:19:55.390 align:middle line:84%
But he came forth
with his ideas.

00:19:55.390 --> 00:19:58.690 align:middle line:90%


00:19:58.690 --> 00:20:00.860 align:middle line:10%
Another architect of
Indian independence

00:20:00.860 --> 00:20:03.810 align:middle line:10%
was Sri Aurobindo,
a philosopher,

00:20:03.810 --> 00:20:07.090 align:middle line:10%
likewise dealing all of
his ideas, even sometimes

00:20:07.090 --> 00:20:09.400 align:middle line:10%
mystical ideas.

00:20:09.400 --> 00:20:12.790 align:middle line:84%
But became an architect
of a new regime

00:20:12.790 --> 00:20:14.950 align:middle line:84%
in a country of hundreds
of millions of people.

00:20:14.950 --> 00:20:17.480 align:middle line:90%


00:20:17.480 --> 00:20:19.070 align:middle line:90%
Ideas are very important.

00:20:19.070 --> 00:20:21.400 align:middle line:84%
They have to come
injected at the right time

00:20:21.400 --> 00:20:24.040 align:middle line:90%
in the right way.

00:20:24.040 --> 00:20:25.790 align:middle line:90%
We have the internet.

00:20:25.790 --> 00:20:28.090 align:middle line:90%
We have communication systems.

00:20:28.090 --> 00:20:29.420 align:middle line:90%
We could do that.

00:20:29.420 --> 00:20:31.300 align:middle line:84%
So therefore, a
small group of people

00:20:31.300 --> 00:20:35.160 align:middle line:84%
with the right ideas
using the right means

00:20:35.160 --> 00:20:37.570 align:middle line:90%
can change the world.

00:20:37.570 --> 00:20:41.140 align:middle line:84%
A critical mass is
already coming to be,

00:20:41.140 --> 00:20:42.800 align:middle line:90%
becoming available.

00:20:42.800 --> 00:20:45.220 align:middle line:90%
It's not yet organized.

00:20:45.220 --> 00:20:49.180 align:middle line:84%
And it is not full
focused on what?

00:20:49.180 --> 00:20:52.810 align:middle line:84%
I suggest that the focus
for such an activity

00:20:52.810 --> 00:20:55.630 align:middle line:84%
is this notion of
super-coherence.

00:20:55.630 --> 00:20:59.080 align:middle line:84%
Let's be coherent,
coherent within ourselves,

00:20:59.080 --> 00:21:01.890 align:middle line:90%
coherent with others.

00:21:01.890 --> 00:21:03.700 align:middle line:90%
Be one.

00:21:03.700 --> 00:21:07.570 align:middle line:84%
An organization that I called
into life some decades ago,

00:21:07.570 --> 00:21:09.130 align:middle line:84%
it's called the
Club of Budapest.

00:21:09.130 --> 00:21:12.700 align:middle line:84%
It has now 24
national associations.

00:21:12.700 --> 00:21:16.460 align:middle line:84%
And I proposed two years ago
that we should all create

00:21:16.460 --> 00:21:19.610 align:middle line:90%
a network of super-coherence.

00:21:19.610 --> 00:21:23.290 align:middle line:84%
So now we have 24 small
organizations operating

00:21:23.290 --> 00:21:26.820 align:middle line:84%
on a shoestring mostly,
but dedicated to an idea

00:21:26.820 --> 00:21:29.580 align:middle line:84%
that they're trying to be
coherent within themselves,

00:21:29.580 --> 00:21:32.950 align:middle line:84%
in fact, to relate coherently to
the other members of this group

00:21:32.950 --> 00:21:35.230 align:middle line:84%
so that the whole group,
the whole network,

00:21:35.230 --> 00:21:38.650 align:middle line:84%
could become coherent with
the world around them.

00:21:38.650 --> 00:21:40.280 align:middle line:90%
Small little inputs.

00:21:40.280 --> 00:21:41.720 align:middle line:90%
It didn't yet blow up.

00:21:41.720 --> 00:21:44.230 align:middle line:84%
It didn't yet flower
into that way that

00:21:44.230 --> 00:21:46.510 align:middle line:90%
would make a major difference.

00:21:46.510 --> 00:21:48.520 align:middle line:84%
Here and there,
there are changes.

00:21:48.520 --> 00:21:52.160 align:middle line:84%
But the time is nearing
when we have no choice.

00:21:52.160 --> 00:21:57.730 align:middle line:84%
We either create a global impact
or we really risk coming apart.

00:21:57.730 --> 00:22:01.420 align:middle line:84%
And that consequences
of that is violence,

00:22:01.420 --> 00:22:03.790 align:middle line:84%
fought with the weapons
of mass destruction

00:22:03.790 --> 00:22:06.230 align:middle line:90%
that are available today.

00:22:06.230 --> 00:22:08.710 align:middle line:84%
So we have to learn
on the middle level

00:22:08.710 --> 00:22:14.030 align:middle line:84%
to operate with an eye to
how we relate to others.

00:22:14.030 --> 00:22:16.930 align:middle line:84%
Now let me go down
to the lowest level.

00:22:16.930 --> 00:22:20.920 align:middle line:84%
Some time ago, some years
ago, I put it forward

00:22:20.920 --> 00:22:23.320 align:middle line:84%
a little book called "You
Can Change the World."

00:22:23.320 --> 00:22:26.170 align:middle line:84%
To which at the time Mikhail
Gorbachev, who was clearly

00:22:26.170 --> 00:22:29.710 align:middle line:84%
one of the leading figures
of the 20th century,

00:22:29.710 --> 00:22:34.150 align:middle line:84%
wrote a beautiful preface saying
that don't trust your leaders,

00:22:34.150 --> 00:22:36.550 align:middle line:90%
take things into your own hands.

00:22:36.550 --> 00:22:38.110 align:middle line:84%
One of the top
leaders of the world

00:22:38.110 --> 00:22:40.840 align:middle line:84%
at the time, the head of the
Communist Party of the Soviet

00:22:40.840 --> 00:22:44.380 align:middle line:84%
Union, coming up with
this insight, you see.

00:22:44.380 --> 00:22:46.030 align:middle line:90%
So we have to act on that.

00:22:46.030 --> 00:22:47.890 align:middle line:90%
But how do we take hands?

00:22:47.890 --> 00:22:51.490 align:middle line:84%
How do we take things
into our own hands?

00:22:51.490 --> 00:22:56.410 align:middle line:84%
I drafted, at one point, a
little list of 10 insights.

00:22:56.410 --> 00:23:00.430 align:middle line:84%
I call them the 10 Commandments
of Responsible Living.

00:23:00.430 --> 00:23:02.560 align:middle line:84%
Allow me to present the
basic points of that.

00:23:02.560 --> 00:23:20.750 align:middle line:90%


00:23:20.750 --> 00:23:23.730 align:middle line:90%
All right.

00:23:23.730 --> 00:23:27.840 align:middle line:84%
First of these 10 Commandments
of Responsible Living,

00:23:27.840 --> 00:23:30.000 align:middle line:84%
and you must all
adjust this, adapt it

00:23:30.000 --> 00:23:31.960 align:middle line:90%
to your own circumstances.

00:23:31.960 --> 00:23:34.060 align:middle line:90%
These are general commandments.

00:23:34.060 --> 00:23:36.780 align:middle line:84%
But the first one says
live in a way that

00:23:36.780 --> 00:23:40.350 align:middle line:84%
satisfies your need
without distracting

00:23:40.350 --> 00:23:45.180 align:middle line:84%
from the opportunity of other
people to satisfy their needs.

00:23:45.180 --> 00:23:47.220 align:middle line:84%
Live in a way, in
other words, that

00:23:47.220 --> 00:23:52.480 align:middle line:84%
allows other people
to live as well.

00:23:52.480 --> 00:23:54.485 align:middle line:84%
So that you can
all live together.

00:23:54.485 --> 00:23:55.860 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't mean
that other people

00:23:55.860 --> 00:23:58.280 align:middle line:90%
have to live the way you live.

00:23:58.280 --> 00:24:00.500 align:middle line:84%
We just simply think
of it, we are members,

00:24:00.500 --> 00:24:03.710 align:middle line:84%
we are part of a large
community, a global community.

00:24:03.710 --> 00:24:07.100 align:middle line:84%
Don't live in a way that
prevents the other people

00:24:07.100 --> 00:24:07.910 align:middle line:90%
to live as well.

00:24:07.910 --> 00:24:11.190 align:middle line:90%


00:24:11.190 --> 00:24:13.050 align:middle line:84%
Live in a way that
respects the right

00:24:13.050 --> 00:24:15.990 align:middle line:84%
to life and to
development of all people.

00:24:15.990 --> 00:24:17.460 align:middle line:90%
It's basically the same thing.

00:24:17.460 --> 00:24:19.510 align:middle line:90%
But it says without--

00:24:19.510 --> 00:24:23.520 align:middle line:84%
without counting ethnic
origin, sex, citizenship,

00:24:23.520 --> 00:24:25.170 align:middle line:90%
or belief systems.

00:24:25.170 --> 00:24:30.930 align:middle line:84%
All people have equally a right
both to live and to develop.

00:24:30.930 --> 00:24:33.450 align:middle line:84%
So that we could
have 7.5 billion,

00:24:33.450 --> 00:24:37.350 align:middle line:84%
moving on to 8 billion
people who can be normal,

00:24:37.350 --> 00:24:40.770 align:middle line:84%
healthy human beings,
healthy biologically,

00:24:40.770 --> 00:24:43.320 align:middle line:84%
healthy ecologically
and socially living

00:24:43.320 --> 00:24:44.550 align:middle line:90%
in a healthy environment.

00:24:44.550 --> 00:24:48.535 align:middle line:84%
And now this comes
down to the third one.

00:24:48.535 --> 00:24:51.030 align:middle line:84%
Live in a way that
safeguards the right

00:24:51.030 --> 00:24:53.490 align:middle line:84%
to a healthy environment
of all the things

00:24:53.490 --> 00:24:55.980 align:middle line:90%
that live on this earth.

00:24:55.980 --> 00:24:57.525 align:middle line:90%
That's also a basic right.

00:24:57.525 --> 00:24:59.080 align:middle line:90%
We have to respect it.

00:24:59.080 --> 00:25:00.740 align:middle line:90%
A healthy environment.

00:25:00.740 --> 00:25:02.800 align:middle line:84%
Now it turns out, a
healthy environment

00:25:02.800 --> 00:25:05.410 align:middle line:84%
is also a key to our
individual health,

00:25:05.410 --> 00:25:07.930 align:middle line:90%
to our biological health even.

00:25:07.930 --> 00:25:12.880 align:middle line:84%
To resonate with a healthy
tree, with a healthy pond,

00:25:12.880 --> 00:25:20.230 align:middle line:84%
with a healthy forest around
us is a key to health in us

00:25:20.230 --> 00:25:21.460 align:middle line:90%
and for us.

00:25:21.460 --> 00:25:27.940 align:middle line:84%
And allow such environment to
be, to exist on this Earth,

00:25:27.940 --> 00:25:31.300 align:middle line:84%
because it's in danger
of disappearing.

00:25:31.300 --> 00:25:34.750 align:middle line:84%
Pursue happiness, freedom,
and personal fulfillment

00:25:34.750 --> 00:25:39.040 align:middle line:84%
in consideration of the
similar pursuits of all people

00:25:39.040 --> 00:25:41.950 align:middle line:90%
in your community.

00:25:41.950 --> 00:25:44.460 align:middle line:90%
You adopt certain goals.

00:25:44.460 --> 00:25:48.360 align:middle line:84%
And you have to recognize that
these goals, other people have

00:25:48.360 --> 00:25:50.740 align:middle line:90%
also a right to these goals.

00:25:50.740 --> 00:25:53.030 align:middle line:90%
They are not unique to you.

00:25:53.030 --> 00:25:54.520 align:middle line:90%
They are basic goals.

00:25:54.520 --> 00:25:58.960 align:middle line:84%
And the basic goals means
that everybody on this Earth

00:25:58.960 --> 00:26:03.660 align:middle line:84%
has a chance to live
and to live well.

00:26:03.660 --> 00:26:06.360 align:middle line:84%
Very specifically,
so number five,

00:26:06.360 --> 00:26:09.990 align:middle line:84%
do your best to help those that
are less privileged than you

00:26:09.990 --> 00:26:14.400 align:middle line:84%
to live without deprivation,
without hunger, without penury.

00:26:14.400 --> 00:26:18.840 align:middle line:84%
We are in a very unequally
developed system.

00:26:18.840 --> 00:26:23.610 align:middle line:84%
A great majority of the people
live at or below the level

00:26:23.610 --> 00:26:25.730 align:middle line:90%
of survival.

00:26:25.730 --> 00:26:29.520 align:middle line:84%
And this diversity is
true on every level,

00:26:29.520 --> 00:26:32.470 align:middle line:84%
even in the richest
country in the world.

00:26:32.470 --> 00:26:34.835 align:middle line:84%
It is sometimes moderated
in some countries.

00:26:34.835 --> 00:26:38.490 align:middle line:84%
For example, the European Nordic
countries, it's very nice.

00:26:38.490 --> 00:26:41.455 align:middle line:84%
The gap between the rich
and the poor is moderated.

00:26:41.455 --> 00:26:45.630 align:middle line:84%
But most everywhere else, it
is a very, very great gap.

00:26:45.630 --> 00:26:51.750 align:middle line:84%
And it's not overcome simply by
taking from the rich and giving

00:26:51.750 --> 00:26:54.750 align:middle line:84%
to the poor-- that's
the Robin Hood idea--

00:26:54.750 --> 00:26:57.560 align:middle line:84%
because that's a
form of violence.

00:26:57.560 --> 00:27:00.360 align:middle line:84%
It's overcome by
recognizing that we

00:27:00.360 --> 00:27:05.835 align:middle line:84%
live in a way that allows even
the poorer people to develop.

00:27:05.835 --> 00:27:11.100 align:middle line:84%
Not to become rich as an idea,
but to survive and fulfill

00:27:11.100 --> 00:27:13.890 align:middle line:84%
their needs, develop,
become healthy,

00:27:13.890 --> 00:27:15.020 align:middle line:90%
developing human beings.

00:27:15.020 --> 00:27:19.600 align:middle line:90%


00:27:19.600 --> 00:27:22.390 align:middle line:84%
Number six, join with
like-minded people

00:27:22.390 --> 00:27:26.290 align:middle line:84%
to preserve or restore the
integrity of the environment.

00:27:26.290 --> 00:27:29.080 align:middle line:84%
Not only allow the
environment to persist,

00:27:29.080 --> 00:27:33.160 align:middle line:84%
to exist, but to actually
restore it, natural.

00:27:33.160 --> 00:27:35.080 align:middle line:90%
Interact with nature.

00:27:35.080 --> 00:27:37.330 align:middle line:84%
From the simplest
way of picking up

00:27:37.330 --> 00:27:39.400 align:middle line:84%
garbage if you walk
around someplace

00:27:39.400 --> 00:27:41.950 align:middle line:84%
and you see that people
throw things out,

00:27:41.950 --> 00:27:43.190 align:middle line:90%
you will pick it up.

00:27:43.190 --> 00:27:45.460 align:middle line:90%
You'll help a little bit.

00:27:45.460 --> 00:27:49.510 align:middle line:84%
Even if you say, well, sooner
or later, some sanitation system

00:27:49.510 --> 00:27:52.840 align:middle line:84%
will come and pick it up,
that's not a good reason,

00:27:52.840 --> 00:27:55.840 align:middle line:84%
because it's no longer a
question of just reasoning it

00:27:55.840 --> 00:27:56.770 align:middle line:90%
out.

00:27:56.770 --> 00:27:57.820 align:middle line:90%
Should I do it?

00:27:57.820 --> 00:27:59.420 align:middle line:90%
It's a question of feeling it.

00:27:59.420 --> 00:28:01.510 align:middle line:90%
It becomes a moral imperative.

00:28:01.510 --> 00:28:05.860 align:middle line:84%
I have to do what I can, because
that's part of my health.

00:28:05.860 --> 00:28:08.080 align:middle line:84%
I live better, I'm
healthier, when

00:28:08.080 --> 00:28:10.900 align:middle line:84%
I allow the environment
to become healthy.

00:28:10.900 --> 00:28:14.035 align:middle line:84%
And so it's deep down at
the core of our heart,

00:28:14.035 --> 00:28:15.940 align:middle line:90%
the core of our existence.

00:28:15.940 --> 00:28:22.220 align:middle line:84%
It becomes ethics, morality, and
not just a pragmatic command.

00:28:22.220 --> 00:28:26.830 align:middle line:90%


00:28:26.830 --> 00:28:29.110 align:middle line:84%
Help children and young
people to discover

00:28:29.110 --> 00:28:33.530 align:middle line:84%
sustainable ways of thinking
and acting of their own.

00:28:33.530 --> 00:28:35.350 align:middle line:90%
Education.

00:28:35.350 --> 00:28:37.530 align:middle line:90%
Education, what is education?

00:28:37.530 --> 00:28:40.020 align:middle line:84%
Just handing down
knowledge that's

00:28:40.020 --> 00:28:42.630 align:middle line:84%
already been
accumulated and codified

00:28:42.630 --> 00:28:45.960 align:middle line:90%
in books and in other ways?

00:28:45.960 --> 00:28:49.800 align:middle line:84%
Or is it really to provide
some of those insights, some

00:28:49.800 --> 00:28:54.870 align:middle line:84%
of those principles that allow
people to live, live together,

00:28:54.870 --> 00:28:57.690 align:middle line:90%
to live well in company?

00:28:57.690 --> 00:29:01.620 align:middle line:84%
I think that's real
education is to teach

00:29:01.620 --> 00:29:04.980 align:middle line:90%
how to live, not by conduct--

00:29:04.980 --> 00:29:09.660 align:middle line:84%
not by directing actions,
but by coming to insights

00:29:09.660 --> 00:29:14.940 align:middle line:84%
that certain things are my
privilege and my duty to live.

00:29:14.940 --> 00:29:16.560 align:middle line:84%
And these commandments
are really

00:29:16.560 --> 00:29:19.530 align:middle line:84%
all about how we
ourselves can educate

00:29:19.530 --> 00:29:22.770 align:middle line:84%
ourselves but help
us and help others

00:29:22.770 --> 00:29:23.870 align:middle line:90%
to come to these insights.

00:29:23.870 --> 00:29:28.360 align:middle line:90%


00:29:28.360 --> 00:29:31.810 align:middle line:84%
Now, we're coming onto the
higher level with number eight

00:29:31.810 --> 00:29:33.970 align:middle line:90%
of these commandments.

00:29:33.970 --> 00:29:36.200 align:middle line:84%
Ask your government that
it deal cooperatively

00:29:36.200 --> 00:29:39.970 align:middle line:84%
with other nations and
cultures, recognizing

00:29:39.970 --> 00:29:42.820 align:middle line:84%
the legitimate
aspirations of all people

00:29:42.820 --> 00:29:46.610 align:middle line:84%
for a better life and a
life supporting environment.

00:29:46.610 --> 00:29:50.950 align:middle line:84%
This means the action, the
principle of cooperation,

00:29:50.950 --> 00:29:53.440 align:middle line:90%
instead of domination.

00:29:53.440 --> 00:29:54.640 align:middle line:90%
Do it together.

00:29:54.640 --> 00:29:58.110 align:middle line:84%
Recognize you can't do
it alone, nobody can.

00:29:58.110 --> 00:29:59.980 align:middle line:90%
We have to cooperate.

00:29:59.980 --> 00:30:05.290 align:middle line:84%
And cooperation means
better life for me, too.

00:30:05.290 --> 00:30:08.460 align:middle line:90%
Pure competition is no good.

00:30:08.460 --> 00:30:09.440 align:middle line:90%
Facing limitations?

00:30:09.440 --> 00:30:10.240 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:30:10.240 --> 00:30:11.440 align:middle line:90%
For common objectives?

00:30:11.440 --> 00:30:12.240 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:30:12.240 --> 00:30:14.220 align:middle line:90%
Compete who can do it best.

00:30:14.220 --> 00:30:17.000 align:middle line:84%
But to kill others
who don't live up

00:30:17.000 --> 00:30:22.220 align:middle line:84%
to the imperatives of the
winner of the competition, that

00:30:22.220 --> 00:30:25.450 align:middle line:84%
is an outdated and very,
very dangerous notion.

00:30:25.450 --> 00:30:28.210 align:middle line:90%


00:30:28.210 --> 00:30:33.490 align:middle line:84%
Next to last, in a practical
way, patronize businesses that

00:30:33.490 --> 00:30:36.130 align:middle line:84%
produce goods and
offer services that

00:30:36.130 --> 00:30:39.580 align:middle line:84%
satisfy your needs and
needs of other people

00:30:39.580 --> 00:30:42.160 align:middle line:84%
without impairing
the environment

00:30:42.160 --> 00:30:46.440 align:middle line:84%
and without extending the gap
between the rich and the poor.

00:30:46.440 --> 00:30:49.810 align:middle line:84%
So relating to business,
relate to others,

00:30:49.810 --> 00:30:52.845 align:middle line:84%
I've talked about so far,
but relate to companies.

00:30:52.845 --> 00:30:56.010 align:middle line:10%
Relate to organized
economic activity

00:30:56.010 --> 00:31:01.350 align:middle line:10%
in such a way that it doesn't
destroy the world around you,

00:31:01.350 --> 00:31:04.770 align:middle line:10%
doesn't grow the gap also.

00:31:04.770 --> 00:31:08.070 align:middle line:10%
Create a healthier,
wholearchic society.

00:31:08.070 --> 00:31:10.840 align:middle line:84%
Hierarchy means the
upper level command.

00:31:10.840 --> 00:31:13.680 align:middle line:84%
A wholearchy means
everybody is interacting

00:31:13.680 --> 00:31:17.010 align:middle line:84%
with everybody else in an
organized, ordered way,

00:31:17.010 --> 00:31:21.720 align:middle line:84%
but not that one level
dictates and the others obey.

00:31:21.720 --> 00:31:23.420 align:middle line:90%
Everybody has an input.

00:31:23.420 --> 00:31:26.640 align:middle line:84%
In a truly democratic system,
everybody has an input.

00:31:26.640 --> 00:31:28.970 align:middle line:84%
It's a wholearchy
and not a hierarchy.

00:31:28.970 --> 00:31:32.010 align:middle line:84%
But today, there is a
hierarchy dictated by wealth

00:31:32.010 --> 00:31:35.020 align:middle line:90%
and by military power.

00:31:35.020 --> 00:31:40.230 align:middle line:84%
Last, but not least, coming
back to what you are doing here

00:31:40.230 --> 00:31:45.010 align:middle line:84%
on this program, give
preference to media

00:31:45.010 --> 00:31:49.390 align:middle line:84%
that provides regular reliable
information on the events that

00:31:49.390 --> 00:31:51.540 align:middle line:90%
effect our lives.

00:31:51.540 --> 00:31:54.550 align:middle line:84%
And make decisions on the
basis of the information

00:31:54.550 --> 00:31:57.380 align:middle line:90%
that you can get from the media.

00:31:57.380 --> 00:32:01.330 align:middle line:84%
The media has this obligation
to talk about the issues that

00:32:01.330 --> 00:32:02.680 align:middle line:90%
effect our life.

00:32:02.680 --> 00:32:06.490 align:middle line:84%
There are now issues
that decide our lives,

00:32:06.490 --> 00:32:11.970 align:middle line:84%
decide whether we can survive
on this planet or collapse.

00:32:11.970 --> 00:32:14.740 align:middle line:90%
Breaks through, break down.

00:32:14.740 --> 00:32:19.710 align:middle line:84%
And the media has the obligation
to report on the events,

00:32:19.710 --> 00:32:22.620 align:middle line:84%
on the trends, on
the facts, that

00:32:22.620 --> 00:32:26.310 align:middle line:84%
enter into this decision,
which way do we go.

00:32:26.310 --> 00:32:30.390 align:middle line:84%
Not just the superficial,
sensationalistic headlines,

00:32:30.390 --> 00:32:32.340 align:middle line:90%
but what lies behind that.

00:32:32.340 --> 00:32:35.340 align:middle line:84%
What is it that really
makes a difference?

00:32:35.340 --> 00:32:39.710 align:middle line:84%
What's that key thing
at its heart itself?

00:32:39.710 --> 00:32:42.060 align:middle line:84%
A difference that
makes a difference.

00:32:42.060 --> 00:32:46.080 align:middle line:84%
What is it truly in the world
that makes a difference?

00:32:46.080 --> 00:32:50.970 align:middle line:84%
Not necessarily just giving,
pie in the sky, beautiful images

00:32:50.970 --> 00:32:55.020 align:middle line:84%
of what could be, but to
show what is happening today.

00:32:55.020 --> 00:32:59.280 align:middle line:84%
And how you, the viewer, the
listener, the participant

00:32:59.280 --> 00:33:03.240 align:middle line:84%
can join in to make
that happen more often.

00:33:03.240 --> 00:33:07.350 align:middle line:84%
To make the good things
happen, to make more equality,

00:33:07.350 --> 00:33:12.420 align:middle line:84%
to make more happiness,
by very concrete ways,

00:33:12.420 --> 00:33:15.240 align:middle line:84%
by allowing all
people following some

00:33:15.240 --> 00:33:18.240 align:middle line:84%
of these very simple
guidelines, allowing all people

00:33:18.240 --> 00:33:23.460 align:middle line:84%
to develop without precluding
anybody from developing

00:33:23.460 --> 00:33:25.260 align:middle line:90%
his or her own destiny.

00:33:25.260 --> 00:33:28.610 align:middle line:90%
