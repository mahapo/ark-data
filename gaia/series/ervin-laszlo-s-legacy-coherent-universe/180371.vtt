00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:31.280 align:middle line:10%
>> There is a very curious
phenomenon in the world which

00:00:31.280 --> 00:00:33.440 align:middle line:10%
is coming more and
more to the fore,

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:36.150 align:middle line:10%
that things happen
at the same time.

00:00:36.150 --> 00:00:38.960 align:middle line:10%
They fall together, as it
were, even though there

00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:41.660 align:middle line:10%
is no way that we would
know how they would actually

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:43.010 align:middle line:10%
be connected.

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:46.110 align:middle line:84%
Great discoveries happened
at the same time period,

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:50.580 align:middle line:84%
with architecture, with the
pyramids being born in--

00:00:50.580 --> 00:00:56.240 align:middle line:84%
in middle America, in some
parts of Europe, and in the east

00:00:56.240 --> 00:01:00.680 align:middle line:84%
and following the same laws,
practically, all at once

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:02.850 align:middle line:90%
in historical time.

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:05.390 align:middle line:84%
Same discoveries--
the great appearance

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:09.040 align:middle line:84%
of the great teachers
in Greece and in China

00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:10.680 align:middle line:90%
almost at the same time.

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:13.620 align:middle line:84%
Now, as far as we know, they
didn't talk to each other.

00:01:13.620 --> 00:01:16.110 align:middle line:90%
They didn't have the internet.

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:19.280 align:middle line:84%
So how come did these
things happen together?

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:23.700 align:middle line:84%
Coincidences that are
meaningful are synchronicity.

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:26.510 align:middle line:84%
So the question is,
what is synchronicity?

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:29.200 align:middle line:90%
It's acausal connection.

00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:31.910 align:middle line:84%
That is almost the
official definition of it,

00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:34.010 align:middle line:90%
no cause and effect, no--

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:36.170 align:middle line:90%
knowable cause and effect.

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:38.300 align:middle line:84%
Of course, there's
a deeper cause.

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:41.170 align:middle line:84%
My consciousness is
collected with yours,

00:01:41.170 --> 00:01:44.120 align:middle line:84%
as we are part of the
same cosmic hologram.

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:47.630 align:middle line:84%
But this is not the
normal push and pull

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:54.980 align:middle line:84%
connection, not by energy and
words creating a difference.

00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:57.320 align:middle line:84%
It's a spontaneous
connection between two

00:01:57.320 --> 00:02:01.130 align:middle line:84%
seemingly unconnected things
that connect together.

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:04.950 align:middle line:84%
And together, they
lead to something.

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:06.360 align:middle line:90%
This is a true synchronicity.

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:08.487 align:middle line:84%
Entire big volumes,
learned volumes,

00:02:08.487 --> 00:02:10.070 align:middle line:84%
have been written
on this because it's

00:02:10.070 --> 00:02:11.810 align:middle line:90%
a remarkable phenomenon.

00:02:11.810 --> 00:02:15.238 align:middle line:84%
And we can't dismiss
it as just imagination.

00:02:15.238 --> 00:02:17.560 align:middle line:90%
[CHIMING]

00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:20.290 align:middle line:84%
The world is an illusion
is one possible answer

00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:23.210 align:middle line:84%
to the question,
what is the world?

00:02:23.210 --> 00:02:25.460 align:middle line:84%
Maybe everything that
we perceive of the world

00:02:25.460 --> 00:02:28.910 align:middle line:84%
is an illusion
created by our mind.

00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:33.410 align:middle line:84%
Or maybe the
illusion is our mind,

00:02:33.410 --> 00:02:39.410 align:middle line:84%
and the world is really there as
a bit of unsensing, non-living,

00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:42.260 align:middle line:90%
just brute matter, as it were.

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:44.290 align:middle line:84%
The Buddha took the
answer, thinking--

00:02:44.290 --> 00:02:47.390 align:middle line:84%
saying that the
world as we perceive

00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:50.270 align:middle line:84%
it is an illusion because
there is something

00:02:50.270 --> 00:02:53.540 align:middle line:84%
more to the world, something
deeper, an underlying

00:02:53.540 --> 00:02:58.460 align:middle line:84%
reality, which-- which is
producing the sensations which

00:02:58.460 --> 00:02:59.760 align:middle line:90%
we call "the world."

00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:01.230 align:middle line:90%
But that's an illusion.

00:03:01.230 --> 00:03:04.280 align:middle line:84%
The reality lies
deeper, more profoundly.

00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:06.200 align:middle line:84%
And that-- by the
way, that thought

00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:09.090 align:middle line:84%
is now shared at the
leading edge of science,

00:03:09.090 --> 00:03:11.790 align:middle line:84%
especially in quantum
science, when we talk

00:03:11.790 --> 00:03:13.430 align:middle line:90%
about the fundamental field.

00:03:13.430 --> 00:03:15.035 align:middle line:90%
But it's also there in--

00:03:15.035 --> 00:03:19.050 align:middle line:84%
in the grand unified
theories, in the theories

00:03:19.050 --> 00:03:20.390 align:middle line:90%
of solid-state matter.

00:03:20.390 --> 00:03:25.090 align:middle line:84%
For example, matter, per se,
had to originate someplace.

00:03:25.090 --> 00:03:27.710 align:middle line:84%
And it originates
at a deeper level.

00:03:27.710 --> 00:03:30.650 align:middle line:84%
And then the deeper
level is the real world,

00:03:30.650 --> 00:03:32.640 align:middle line:90%
and matter is an illusion.

00:03:32.640 --> 00:03:37.769 align:middle line:84%
This statement would now be
accepted by leading physicists.

00:03:37.769 --> 00:03:40.040 align:middle line:90%
[CHIMING]

00:03:40.040 --> 00:03:43.820 align:middle line:84%
My acquaintance with
Taoism shows that this is--

00:03:43.820 --> 00:03:47.330 align:middle line:84%
what I'm doing is rediscovering
something that has already

00:03:47.330 --> 00:03:51.200 align:middle line:84%
been discovered and discussed
but rediscovering in my way,

00:03:51.200 --> 00:03:52.410 align:middle line:90%
in my own way.

00:03:52.410 --> 00:03:56.090 align:middle line:84%
But Tao is entirely--
the idea of the Tao

00:03:56.090 --> 00:04:00.470 align:middle line:84%
as the guidance system is
coming from a deeper level.

00:04:00.470 --> 00:04:03.380 align:middle line:84%
It's coming from an
Akashic dimension.

00:04:03.380 --> 00:04:04.820 align:middle line:90%
That is entirely true.

00:04:04.820 --> 00:04:08.320 align:middle line:84%
And I am today also working
with Taoist masters,

00:04:08.320 --> 00:04:10.832 align:middle line:90%
for example, Master Sha.

00:04:10.832 --> 00:04:13.760 align:middle line:84%
I am an advisor to his
university, which is just

00:04:13.760 --> 00:04:16.950 align:middle line:90%
opening now in Colorado.

00:04:16.950 --> 00:04:22.310 align:middle line:84%
So Tao is something that we have
discussed in this same place,

00:04:22.310 --> 00:04:25.986 align:middle line:84%
in this room here, the Taoist
master, for days on end.

00:04:25.986 --> 00:04:28.470 align:middle line:90%
[CHIMING]

00:04:28.470 --> 00:04:31.160 align:middle line:84%
This-- makes this
misinterpretation

00:04:31.160 --> 00:04:32.660 align:middle line:90%
of the world as an illusion.

00:04:32.660 --> 00:04:35.450 align:middle line:84%
Therefore, it doesn't
matter what we do.

00:04:35.450 --> 00:04:40.140 align:middle line:84%
It's a misinterpretation
because it's--

00:04:40.140 --> 00:04:43.800 align:middle line:84%
the world as we think
it comes from someplace.

00:04:43.800 --> 00:04:46.080 align:middle line:84%
The thought comes
from someplace.

00:04:46.080 --> 00:04:48.240 align:middle line:90%
If it's absolutely arbitrary--

00:04:48.240 --> 00:04:52.180 align:middle line:90%
mistaken, yes-- then--

00:04:52.180 --> 00:04:53.760 align:middle line:84%
then the source
might be mistaken,

00:04:53.760 --> 00:04:55.620 align:middle line:90%
but the consequences are real.

00:04:55.620 --> 00:04:59.030 align:middle line:84%
If you think it doesn't
matter and in reality--

00:04:59.030 --> 00:05:03.070 align:middle line:84%
reality, it does, and we destroy
something, then, of course,

00:05:03.070 --> 00:05:04.280 align:middle line:90%
we'll pay the consequence.

00:05:04.280 --> 00:05:06.280 align:middle line:90%
We'll pay the price.

00:05:06.280 --> 00:05:09.580 align:middle line:90%
So it's-- the world is--

00:05:09.580 --> 00:05:12.640 align:middle line:90%
as it is out there is out there.

00:05:12.640 --> 00:05:15.108 align:middle line:84%
How we think of it
can be an illusion.

[CHIMING]

00:05:18.390 --> 00:05:24.460 align:middle line:84%
We have divorced ourselves
from our true nature.

00:05:24.460 --> 00:05:26.380 align:middle line:90%
We are not here by accident.

00:05:26.380 --> 00:05:29.410 align:middle line:84%
We are here for the same reason
that the galaxies are here

00:05:29.410 --> 00:05:32.555 align:middle line:84%
and that the single-celled
organisms are here

00:05:32.555 --> 00:05:34.610 align:middle line:90%
and the plants are here.

00:05:34.610 --> 00:05:37.460 align:middle line:84%
We are here as part of
an evolutionary process.

00:05:37.460 --> 00:05:39.270 align:middle line:90%
But we have ignored--

00:05:39.270 --> 00:05:40.570 align:middle line:90%
we are ignoring this.

00:05:40.570 --> 00:05:42.320 align:middle line:84%
We are also rejecting
the idea that

00:05:42.320 --> 00:05:46.970 align:middle line:84%
there being a higher purpose
built into the universe.

00:05:46.970 --> 00:05:49.160 align:middle line:84%
And we are destroying
the environment

00:05:49.160 --> 00:05:52.310 align:middle line:84%
because we are no
longer connected

00:05:52.310 --> 00:05:55.670 align:middle line:90%
on that felt experience level.

00:05:55.670 --> 00:06:01.130 align:middle line:84%
Our connection is there, but we
don't feel it, don't sense it.

00:06:01.130 --> 00:06:04.370 align:middle line:84%
We will need to
recover that to become

00:06:04.370 --> 00:06:09.450 align:middle line:84%
more aware of the true nature
of nature, so to speak.

00:06:09.450 --> 00:06:14.160 align:middle line:84%
But the nature of nature is also
the nature of our being here.

00:06:14.160 --> 00:06:18.190 align:middle line:84%
We are destroying something
that we don't feel connected to.

00:06:18.190 --> 00:06:23.210 align:middle line:84%
We think it's just there
as-- as a mechanical,

00:06:23.210 --> 00:06:26.870 align:middle line:84%
uncaused consequence and
meaningless consequence

00:06:26.870 --> 00:06:30.410 align:middle line:84%
of the universe operating
in a certain way,

00:06:30.410 --> 00:06:31.860 align:middle line:90%
just happening to be--

00:06:31.860 --> 00:06:35.350 align:middle line:84%
to produce these kind of things,
no further meaning to it.

00:06:35.350 --> 00:06:40.640 align:middle line:84%
We need to recover our oneness,
our contact, our communication,

00:06:40.640 --> 00:06:43.510 align:middle line:84%
if you like, with
the environment.

to assist in people
taking themselves

seriously and exploring
themselves, stopping

00:06:57.860 --> 00:06:58.890 align:middle line:90%
for a moment.

00:06:58.890 --> 00:07:00.800 align:middle line:84%
Stop the world, and
think of who you

00:07:00.800 --> 00:07:03.630 align:middle line:84%
are because when
you come back, you

00:07:03.630 --> 00:07:07.200 align:middle line:84%
might act more together
in synchronicity,

00:07:07.200 --> 00:07:10.620 align:middle line:90%
in syntony with the world.

from this my-- wild rush

00:07:16.130 --> 00:07:22.170 align:middle line:84%
toward technically and
mechanically exploiting things

00:07:22.170 --> 00:07:26.010 align:middle line:84%
that satisfy our
immediate wants and needs

00:07:26.010 --> 00:07:29.470 align:middle line:84%
and understand
better who we are,

00:07:29.470 --> 00:07:34.480 align:middle line:84%
how we relate to nature, what
nature is, not philosophically,

00:07:34.480 --> 00:07:40.980 align:middle line:84%
not having to go even into deep
theoretical considerations.

00:07:40.980 --> 00:07:42.420 align:middle line:90%
Just sense it.

00:07:42.420 --> 00:07:45.690 align:middle line:84%
Sense the world as
it is around you.

00:07:45.690 --> 00:07:46.820 align:middle line:90%
Become one with it.

00:07:46.820 --> 00:07:48.990 align:middle line:90%
Walk in the forest.

00:07:48.990 --> 00:07:51.760 align:middle line:84%
Sit down for a moment,
and look at the sun

00:07:51.760 --> 00:07:54.270 align:middle line:84%
or look at the
brightness around.

00:07:54.270 --> 00:07:58.210 align:middle line:10%
It's a remarkable world,
and it's not a casual world.

00:07:58.210 --> 00:08:00.850 align:middle line:84%
It's a world that has
its meaning and sense.

00:08:00.850 --> 00:08:05.396 align:middle line:84%
So I would say reorient
yourself, the individual,

00:08:05.396 --> 00:08:07.270 align:middle line:84%
and then groups of
individuals, because those

00:08:07.270 --> 00:08:08.660 align:middle line:90%
will change the world.

00:08:08.660 --> 00:08:12.390 align:middle line:84%
Reorient toward an
understanding that you

00:08:12.390 --> 00:08:15.390 align:middle line:84%
are part of a larger
development, which

00:08:15.390 --> 00:08:16.590 align:middle line:90%
you call "evolution."

00:08:16.590 --> 00:08:20.810 align:middle line:84%
And evolution on Earth is part
of evolution in the universe.

00:08:20.810 --> 00:08:23.500 align:middle line:84%
That is what I think
we need to recognize.

00:08:23.500 --> 00:08:26.940 align:middle line:84%
And then we'll come back
and be more careful, more--

00:08:26.940 --> 00:08:32.340 align:middle line:84%
more and better advised,
more sound in our decisions

00:08:32.340 --> 00:08:33.179 align:middle line:90%
as to how to live.

Some years ago, Marshall
McLuhan, the Canadian,

00:08:40.340 --> 00:08:45.130 align:middle line:10%
the thinker of the connections,
of electronic connections,

00:08:45.130 --> 00:08:48.000 align:middle line:10%
he said, "The medium
is the message."

00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:49.670 align:middle line:90%
But I don't agree.

00:08:49.670 --> 00:08:52.530 align:middle line:84%
A medium is an instrument
to convey the message.

00:08:52.530 --> 00:08:55.712 align:middle line:84%
The medium itself
is not the message.

00:08:55.712 --> 00:08:58.500 align:middle line:84%
He thought if you start
connecting to each other,

00:08:58.500 --> 00:09:00.910 align:middle line:90%
then you will be connected.

00:09:00.910 --> 00:09:04.050 align:middle line:84%
But you can be connected
in so many different ways.

00:09:04.050 --> 00:09:07.080 align:middle line:84%
You can be connected as
part of a terrorist group.

00:09:07.080 --> 00:09:09.240 align:middle line:84%
You can be part of
an evangelical group.

00:09:09.240 --> 00:09:11.950 align:middle line:84%
You can be part of
a business group.

00:09:11.950 --> 00:09:14.490 align:middle line:84%
You can be many
things, and they all

00:09:14.490 --> 00:09:16.200 align:middle line:90%
will be based on connection.

00:09:16.200 --> 00:09:18.810 align:middle line:84%
But the internet is an
instrument for connection,

00:09:18.810 --> 00:09:22.230 align:middle line:84%
for the good, for the
indifferent, and for the bad.

00:09:22.230 --> 00:09:25.380 align:middle line:84%
Let's try to make it
work in such a way

00:09:25.380 --> 00:09:28.410 align:middle line:84%
that it promotes our
being in the world

00:09:28.410 --> 00:09:30.480 align:middle line:84%
and being together
with each other

00:09:30.480 --> 00:09:34.620 align:middle line:84%
and creating a sphere
of meaningful life

00:09:34.620 --> 00:09:38.136 align:middle line:84%
on this planet, which we're
in danger of losing that.

00:09:38.136 --> 00:09:41.280 align:middle line:84%
Losing life is becoming
meaningless and becoming

00:09:41.280 --> 00:09:46.440 align:middle line:84%
conflictual and is in danger
of disappearing altogether

00:09:46.440 --> 00:09:52.800 align:middle line:84%
as we use more and more powerful
means of enforcing our contact,

00:09:52.800 --> 00:09:55.400 align:middle line:90%
our domination over others.

00:09:55.400 --> 00:09:57.990 align:middle line:84%
The internet could facilitate
all the good things

00:09:57.990 --> 00:10:01.650 align:middle line:84%
in the world, as well as the
best things in the world.

00:10:01.650 --> 00:10:03.630 align:middle line:84%
So the adults in
the room, if they

00:10:03.630 --> 00:10:08.850 align:middle line:84%
use the internet to share their
insights, their conclusions,

00:10:08.850 --> 00:10:11.710 align:middle line:84%
or even just their
explorations, it

00:10:11.710 --> 00:10:14.520 align:middle line:84%
will be a very
great step forward.

00:10:14.520 --> 00:10:16.440 align:middle line:84%
The problem is to
use the internet

00:10:16.440 --> 00:10:19.020 align:middle line:90%
for itself, just as a--

00:10:19.020 --> 00:10:20.070 align:middle line:90%
as a use technology.

00:10:20.070 --> 00:10:22.860 align:middle line:84%
Then it's a kind of a
toy, like you're using--

00:10:22.860 --> 00:10:26.730 align:middle line:84%
a new car comes along that it's
more powerful than the others,

00:10:26.730 --> 00:10:27.750 align:middle line:90%
you know?

00:10:27.750 --> 00:10:28.080 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:10:28.080 --> 00:10:29.370 align:middle line:90%
That's a great fascination.

00:10:29.370 --> 00:10:32.270 align:middle line:84%
I used to love
driving sports cars.

00:10:32.270 --> 00:10:35.760 align:middle line:84%
But I realized that the point
is where this car takes you.

00:10:35.760 --> 00:10:38.850 align:middle line:84%
Now I'm more interested in
where I'm going with the car

00:10:38.850 --> 00:10:41.630 align:middle line:84%
than just the technology
of getting there, you know?

00:10:41.630 --> 00:10:43.380 align:middle line:84%
So the internet--
in the internet

00:10:43.380 --> 00:10:46.050 align:middle line:84%
is a technology for
getting someplace.

00:10:46.050 --> 00:10:49.960 align:middle line:84%
But we have forgotten to
ask, where do we want to go?

00:10:49.960 --> 00:10:52.200 align:middle line:84%
So a great instrument,
almost, I would

00:10:52.200 --> 00:10:56.070 align:middle line:84%
say, an essential instrument,
irreplaceable instrument today

00:10:56.070 --> 00:10:59.670 align:middle line:84%
in a complex world of
seven billion people

00:10:59.670 --> 00:11:02.760 align:middle line:84%
to use this connection,
which is the internet.

00:11:02.760 --> 00:11:06.390 align:middle line:84%
But use it consciously and
not just as a fascination

00:11:06.390 --> 00:11:08.806 align:middle line:90%
for technology itself.

00:11:08.806 --> 00:11:11.290 align:middle line:90%
[CHIMING]

00:11:11.290 --> 00:11:14.930 align:middle line:84%
Well, Plato's analogy
of the cave, of a--

00:11:14.930 --> 00:11:18.170 align:middle line:84%
of a group of
prisoners, we call it,

00:11:18.170 --> 00:11:20.760 align:middle line:84%
who are changed in
such a way in a cave

00:11:20.760 --> 00:11:22.530 align:middle line:90%
that they only can see forward.

00:11:22.530 --> 00:11:25.860 align:middle line:84%
And there's a fire, big fire
behind this, a big flame.

00:11:25.860 --> 00:11:29.160 align:middle line:90%
And they-- these flames show--

00:11:29.160 --> 00:11:31.200 align:middle line:84%
throw shadows on the
wall in front of them.

00:11:31.200 --> 00:11:33.250 align:middle line:84%
So the prisoners
see the shadows.

00:11:33.250 --> 00:11:35.440 align:middle line:84%
They can only speculate
what the nature of the fire

00:11:35.440 --> 00:11:36.240 align:middle line:90%
is behind them.

00:11:36.240 --> 00:11:38.110 align:middle line:84%
They can't turn
their heads around.

00:11:38.110 --> 00:11:38.910 align:middle line:90%
We are like that.

00:11:38.910 --> 00:11:40.890 align:middle line:90%
We can't turn our heads around.

00:11:40.890 --> 00:11:43.620 align:middle line:84%
We see superficial
phenomena, and we

00:11:43.620 --> 00:11:46.830 align:middle line:84%
try to think what
they really could be.

00:11:46.830 --> 00:11:50.520 align:middle line:84%
The key insight
to this is perhaps

00:11:50.520 --> 00:11:53.610 align:middle line:90%
the truth of this assumption.

00:11:53.610 --> 00:11:56.770 align:middle line:84%
The shadows are not
really a reality.

00:11:56.770 --> 00:11:59.320 align:middle line:90%
That's not all there is.

00:11:59.320 --> 00:12:03.840 align:middle line:84%
The shadows are something
that represents a reality.

00:12:03.840 --> 00:12:07.040 align:middle line:90%
We need to penetrate to it.

00:12:07.040 --> 00:12:10.710 align:middle line:84%
In Plato's analogy, turning
our head to look behind

00:12:10.710 --> 00:12:11.950 align:middle line:90%
is equivalent in the--

00:12:11.950 --> 00:12:16.140 align:middle line:84%
in the latest science and the
scientific and practical sense,

00:12:16.140 --> 00:12:19.650 align:middle line:84%
understanding that
the sensory reality

00:12:19.650 --> 00:12:22.710 align:middle line:84%
is one element, one
dimension, which is

00:12:22.710 --> 00:12:26.560 align:middle line:90%
produced by a deeper dimension.

00:12:26.560 --> 00:12:30.300 align:middle line:84%
But they call it the "Akashic
field" or "Akashic dimension"

00:12:30.300 --> 00:12:35.060 align:middle line:84%
or call it the "implicate order"
or the "grand unified field"

00:12:35.060 --> 00:12:38.120 align:middle line:90%
or the "cosmic quantum field."

00:12:38.120 --> 00:12:40.740 align:middle line:84%
Whatever-- however we
call it, it's there.

00:12:40.740 --> 00:12:44.730 align:middle line:84%
There is something which
holds all the things that

00:12:44.730 --> 00:12:46.590 align:middle line:84%
are happening in
the world together,

00:12:46.590 --> 00:12:50.940 align:middle line:84%
creates orientation,
creates guidance, conveys

00:12:50.940 --> 00:12:55.260 align:middle line:84%
the laws of nature, and this
is by nature of our mind.

00:12:55.260 --> 00:12:59.940 align:middle line:84%
So it is a deep mind, as
without it, the universe

00:12:59.940 --> 00:13:01.440 align:middle line:90%
is inconceivable.

00:13:01.440 --> 00:13:02.790 align:middle line:90%
It would be chaotic.

00:13:02.790 --> 00:13:05.160 align:middle line:84%
The very fact that the
universe is not chaotic,

00:13:05.160 --> 00:13:09.300 align:middle line:84%
not purely prey to
chance, supposes,

00:13:09.300 --> 00:13:13.410 align:middle line:84%
makes you postulate
that there is

00:13:13.410 --> 00:13:17.740 align:middle line:84%
some thing, some intelligence
that is behind it.

00:13:17.740 --> 00:13:20.020 align:middle line:90%
So Plato had this idea.

00:13:20.020 --> 00:13:22.350 align:middle line:84%
I was-- for a long time
in my-- in my life,

00:13:22.350 --> 00:13:26.190 align:middle line:84%
I was more an Aristotelian
than Platonist-- than Platonist

00:13:26.190 --> 00:13:28.730 align:middle line:84%
because I was thinking you
have to observe and make

00:13:28.730 --> 00:13:31.380 align:middle line:84%
your theories on the
basis of observation.

00:13:31.380 --> 00:13:34.350 align:middle line:84%
Then I began to realize
already now for the past 10,

00:13:34.350 --> 00:13:37.720 align:middle line:84%
15 years that you don't
understand what you really

00:13:37.720 --> 00:13:41.920 align:middle line:84%
observe until you go to
the roots, to the source.

00:13:41.920 --> 00:13:43.320 align:middle line:90%
And that's deeper.

00:13:43.320 --> 00:13:45.322 align:middle line:90%
That's beyond what you observe.

00:13:45.322 --> 00:13:48.100 align:middle line:90%
[CHIMING]

00:13:48.100 --> 00:13:49.810 align:middle line:84%
I believe in life
after death because I

00:13:49.810 --> 00:13:54.810 align:middle line:84%
believe in consciousness not
being limited to the brain.

00:13:54.810 --> 00:13:56.780 align:middle line:84%
So if you call
consciousness, "life," yes.

00:13:56.780 --> 00:14:01.940 align:middle line:84%
It's not organic life, not
the ordinary organic life.

00:14:01.940 --> 00:14:06.080 align:middle line:84%
I can-- in my terms, I
can explain, so to speak.

00:14:06.080 --> 00:14:08.550 align:middle line:84%
I can provide the
best explanation

00:14:08.550 --> 00:14:11.820 align:middle line:84%
that I can come up with
out of this phenomenon

00:14:11.820 --> 00:14:15.590 align:middle line:84%
by saying that the
life, organic life,

00:14:15.590 --> 00:14:19.910 align:middle line:84%
is one set of vibrations,
a given frequency.

00:14:19.910 --> 00:14:25.185 align:middle line:84%
And consciousness, which exists
independently of organic life,

00:14:25.185 --> 00:14:27.080 align:middle line:90%
organic picks it up.

00:14:27.080 --> 00:14:28.880 align:middle line:90%
It's another frequency.

00:14:28.880 --> 00:14:33.180 align:middle line:84%
It's a deeper frequency of
vibration in the universe.

00:14:33.180 --> 00:14:38.910 align:middle line:84%
So incarnate living,
body and soul together,

00:14:38.910 --> 00:14:41.610 align:middle line:84%
means that you are
receiving and work--

00:14:41.610 --> 00:14:45.150 align:middle line:84%
decoding, working
with both the one

00:14:45.150 --> 00:14:48.720 align:middle line:84%
level of vibration, the everyday
world, and the deep level.

00:14:48.720 --> 00:14:52.450 align:middle line:84%
They're joined together,
your mind and body together.

00:14:52.450 --> 00:14:58.050 align:middle line:84%
When die-- when one dies, then
that one level of vibration,

00:14:58.050 --> 00:15:02.230 align:middle line:84%
the surface level, the level
of the body, it disappears.

00:15:02.230 --> 00:15:03.720 align:middle line:90%
It vanishes.

00:15:03.720 --> 00:15:06.540 align:middle line:84%
If you are reborn,
then it comes in again.

00:15:06.540 --> 00:15:11.210 align:middle line:84%
But until then, the other
level, which is the deep level,

00:15:11.210 --> 00:15:12.240 align:middle line:90%
continues.

00:15:12.240 --> 00:15:14.820 align:middle line:84%
It's still there
because it does--

00:15:14.820 --> 00:15:18.150 align:middle line:84%
it is not produced by
the brain, by the body.

00:15:18.150 --> 00:15:19.180 align:middle line:90%
But it is interacting.

00:15:19.180 --> 00:15:19.980 align:middle line:90%
It shows up.

00:15:19.980 --> 00:15:22.600 align:middle line:90%
It is manifested by the body.

00:15:22.600 --> 00:15:25.860 align:middle line:84%
So I do believe that our
mind, our consciousness,

00:15:25.860 --> 00:15:30.450 align:middle line:84%
is immortal, as immortal
as the deep dimension,

00:15:30.450 --> 00:15:33.460 align:middle line:84%
as the laws of nature,
as everything that--

00:15:33.460 --> 00:15:36.250 align:middle line:84%
as that intelligence
that governs the world.

00:15:36.250 --> 00:15:37.500 align:middle line:90%
That's all immortal.

00:15:37.500 --> 00:15:39.170 align:middle line:90%
It's eternal.

00:15:39.170 --> 00:15:43.620 align:middle line:84%
Well, what is transitory is
the manifestation of this.

00:15:43.620 --> 00:15:45.450 align:middle line:84%
And therefore,
this manifestation

00:15:45.450 --> 00:15:49.110 align:middle line:84%
is also what appears in
our everyday consciousness.

00:15:49.110 --> 00:15:52.800 align:middle line:84%
It's our manifestation of
the transient phenomenon

00:15:52.800 --> 00:15:54.160 align:middle line:90%
of the body.

00:15:54.160 --> 00:16:00.010 align:middle line:84%
Deep down, we can find that
source, that origin of things.

00:16:00.010 --> 00:16:05.930 align:middle line:84%
And that is what is the reality,
which is not transitory.

00:16:05.930 --> 00:16:10.230 align:middle line:84%
The Akashic record is
a record of the events

00:16:10.230 --> 00:16:13.580 align:middle line:84%
that happen in what people
call the "deep mind."

00:16:13.580 --> 00:16:19.350 align:middle line:10%
Record-- the Akashic record
is memory, is a memory field.

00:16:19.350 --> 00:16:21.970 align:middle line:84%
In that sense,
it's-- it's a mind.

00:16:21.970 --> 00:16:25.500 align:middle line:84%
If you ask yourself, is
the hard drive of memory

00:16:25.500 --> 00:16:28.840 align:middle line:84%
that you hold in your hand, is
that the same as your computer,

00:16:28.840 --> 00:16:32.790 align:middle line:84%
it's an element of your computer
when you're switched into it.

00:16:32.790 --> 00:16:34.890 align:middle line:90%
It's a record.

00:16:34.890 --> 00:16:39.620 align:middle line:84%
The great assumption
and I would say

00:16:39.620 --> 00:16:42.140 align:middle line:84%
discovery is that
there's nothing

00:16:42.140 --> 00:16:44.900 align:middle line:90%
purely transient in the world.

00:16:44.900 --> 00:16:49.020 align:middle line:84%
Everything happens--
remains, in a sense.

00:16:49.020 --> 00:16:51.800 align:middle line:84%
It remains part of what
is happening after that.

00:16:51.800 --> 00:16:53.750 align:middle line:84%
And it's the best
part because there

00:16:53.750 --> 00:16:58.010 align:middle line:84%
is this deep mind,
this intricate order,

00:16:58.010 --> 00:17:01.240 align:middle line:84%
our Akashic field,
which is a memory.

00:17:01.240 --> 00:17:03.080 align:middle line:84%
It's a memory of
all that happens.

00:17:03.080 --> 00:17:04.640 align:middle line:84%
It's a governing
factor because it's

00:17:04.640 --> 00:17:08.990 align:middle line:84%
built into-- into it is built
the direction, built how

00:17:08.990 --> 00:17:11.720 align:middle line:84%
to proceed, built to
proceed through what

00:17:11.720 --> 00:17:14.800 align:middle line:90%
I call a "holistic dimension."

00:17:14.800 --> 00:17:19.440 align:middle line:84%
We are creating systems,
creating integral systems that

00:17:19.440 --> 00:17:20.890 align:middle line:90%
evolve together.

00:17:20.890 --> 00:17:23.540 align:middle line:84%
What was called
"Akashic records,"

00:17:23.540 --> 00:17:25.440 align:middle line:90%
that's only a part of it.

00:17:25.440 --> 00:17:28.000 align:middle line:84%
That's the recording
part, so to speak.

00:17:28.000 --> 00:17:30.860 align:middle line:84%
But the deep mind has
also a dynamic part.

00:17:30.860 --> 00:17:33.290 align:middle line:84%
It has what I call
"attractors," and attractors

00:17:33.290 --> 00:17:36.920 align:middle line:84%
that are shifting constantly
evolution and guiding it

00:17:36.920 --> 00:17:41.720 align:middle line:84%
in a direction, a direction
of building complex systems,

00:17:41.720 --> 00:17:44.960 align:middle line:90%
building unity and diversity.

00:17:44.960 --> 00:17:51.170 align:middle line:84%
And so I think the Akashic
field is the together.

00:17:51.170 --> 00:17:53.750 align:middle line:84%
The Akashic record,
in a deeper sense

00:17:53.750 --> 00:17:57.740 align:middle line:84%
of a field, a guidance field,
is a deep mind operating

00:17:57.740 --> 00:17:58.550 align:middle line:90%
in the world.

00:17:58.550 --> 00:18:01.280 align:middle line:84%
I would accept the deep
mind as an expression

00:18:01.280 --> 00:18:02.990 align:middle line:90%
for the implicate order.

00:18:02.990 --> 00:18:04.915 align:middle line:90%
The cosmos is the deep mind.

00:18:04.915 --> 00:18:07.820 align:middle line:84%
The universe is something
that is produced

00:18:07.820 --> 00:18:10.890 align:middle line:90%
in and by the deep mind.

00:18:10.890 --> 00:18:14.650 align:middle line:84%
The cosmos is and the
universe, as far as we know,

00:18:14.650 --> 00:18:19.800 align:middle line:84%
now this universe has appeared
13.8 billion years ago,

00:18:19.800 --> 00:18:23.520 align:middle line:84%
roughly, after the Big
Bang or with the Big Bang.

00:18:23.520 --> 00:18:26.260 align:middle line:84%
But the cosmos was something
there that was there before

00:18:26.260 --> 00:18:27.895 align:middle line:90%
and will be there after.

00:18:27.895 --> 00:18:30.120 align:middle line:90%
[CHIMING]

00:18:30.120 --> 00:18:32.130 align:middle line:90%
It's possible to con--

00:18:32.130 --> 00:18:35.520 align:middle line:84%
we are always in contact
with the deep mind.

00:18:35.520 --> 00:18:40.410 align:middle line:84%
To be really guided by it,
to be consonant with it,

00:18:40.410 --> 00:18:41.890 align:middle line:90%
we have to resonate with it.

00:18:41.890 --> 00:18:47.080 align:middle line:84%
We have to tune ourselves so
that it acts physically on us,

00:18:47.080 --> 00:18:51.600 align:middle line:84%
so that it guides our movements
and guides our thinking, also.

00:18:51.600 --> 00:18:57.760 align:middle line:84%
So it's a question of using the
contact for effective change,

00:18:57.760 --> 00:19:00.670 align:middle line:90%
for effective information.

00:19:00.670 --> 00:19:03.130 align:middle line:84%
Let me use this term
"information" as a hyphen,

00:19:03.130 --> 00:19:04.760 align:middle line:90%
"in-form."

00:19:04.760 --> 00:19:06.410 align:middle line:90%
The deep mind is contacted.

00:19:06.410 --> 00:19:08.120 align:middle line:90%
We are constantly in contact.

00:19:08.120 --> 00:19:09.960 align:middle line:90%
We're living with the deep mind.

00:19:09.960 --> 00:19:13.340 align:middle line:84%
But for most of it and for
most people, it's ignored.

00:19:13.340 --> 00:19:16.280 align:middle line:84%
It's simply as if
it didn't exist.

00:19:16.280 --> 00:19:18.100 align:middle line:84%
Fortunately, it
exists sufficiently so

00:19:18.100 --> 00:19:22.000 align:middle line:84%
that physically, our physical
body has this ki or the chi

00:19:22.000 --> 00:19:24.640 align:middle line:84%
and this kind of information
which the Easterners say

00:19:24.640 --> 00:19:27.210 align:middle line:90%
is the chi, which enables the--

00:19:27.210 --> 00:19:28.870 align:middle line:90%
the bodies, these organs.

00:19:28.870 --> 00:19:33.640 align:middle line:84%
And it's also the body to become
a single, coherent, viable

00:19:33.640 --> 00:19:35.080 align:middle line:90%
organism.

00:19:35.080 --> 00:19:39.430 align:middle line:84%
But beyond that, we often
disregard and neglect

00:19:39.430 --> 00:19:43.360 align:middle line:84%
the deeper information,
which would also make us

00:19:43.360 --> 00:19:47.870 align:middle line:84%
as individuals be a coherent
part of the human community

00:19:47.870 --> 00:19:50.730 align:middle line:90%
and in the community of life.

00:19:50.730 --> 00:19:53.440 align:middle line:90%
So we become-- become--

00:19:53.440 --> 00:19:58.150 align:middle line:84%
we need to tune ourselves
to receive and to be

00:19:58.150 --> 00:20:00.611 align:middle line:90%
guided by this deep mind.

00:20:00.611 --> 00:20:03.200 align:middle line:90%
[CHIMING]

00:20:03.200 --> 00:20:06.080 align:middle line:84%
Yes, I think the deep mind
is the opposite of entropy.

00:20:06.080 --> 00:20:09.850 align:middle line:84%
Entropy is a physical process
that really only exists

00:20:09.850 --> 00:20:13.150 align:middle line:84%
in a closed system, a
system that doesn't pick up

00:20:13.150 --> 00:20:15.550 align:middle line:84%
energy information and
matter from outside

00:20:15.550 --> 00:20:17.560 align:middle line:90%
and doesn't exchange.

00:20:17.560 --> 00:20:20.980 align:middle line:84%
There are no such systems
actually in reality.

00:20:20.980 --> 00:20:22.390 align:middle line:90%
That we from physics.

00:20:22.390 --> 00:20:24.850 align:middle line:84%
Everything that exists
in this universe

00:20:24.850 --> 00:20:28.440 align:middle line:84%
is in one way or
another available for--

00:20:28.440 --> 00:20:31.690 align:middle line:84%
for receiving energy
and information,

00:20:31.690 --> 00:20:35.610 align:middle line:84%
even if it seems on the short
term locally that it's closed.

00:20:35.610 --> 00:20:37.640 align:middle line:84%
There's nothing
absolutely closed.

00:20:37.640 --> 00:20:41.350 align:middle line:84%
So in as much as we
are also open systems

00:20:41.350 --> 00:20:47.940 align:middle line:84%
and basically are open systems,
we are open to evolution

00:20:47.940 --> 00:20:52.360 align:middle line:84%
and guided by the
attractors, by the deep mind,

00:20:52.360 --> 00:20:56.410 align:middle line:84%
because we are constantly
interchanging, exchanging,

00:20:56.410 --> 00:20:57.820 align:middle line:90%
information.

00:20:57.820 --> 00:21:01.600 align:middle line:84%
Therefore, this motivation,
this impulse toward wholeness,

00:21:01.600 --> 00:21:06.170 align:middle line:84%
toward oneness, toward
creating larger unities,

00:21:06.170 --> 00:21:08.070 align:middle line:84%
we are constantly
subject to this.

00:21:08.070 --> 00:21:09.690 align:middle line:84%
We are constantly
receiving that.

00:21:09.690 --> 00:21:11.036 align:middle line:90%
We are part of that.

00:21:11.036 --> 00:21:13.170 align:middle line:90%
[CHIMING]

00:21:13.170 --> 00:21:15.110 align:middle line:90%
Our consciousness was always--

00:21:15.110 --> 00:21:18.540 align:middle line:84%
is always a part of
this deeper dimension,

00:21:18.540 --> 00:21:20.230 align:middle line:90%
the Akashic dimension.

00:21:20.230 --> 00:21:24.740 align:middle line:84%
It's-- when we die, it's only
the aspect of our experience

00:21:24.740 --> 00:21:30.020 align:middle line:84%
which is produced by our
physical brain is seizing.

00:21:30.020 --> 00:21:32.650 align:middle line:90%
That no longer is operating.

00:21:32.650 --> 00:21:36.160 align:middle line:84%
In rebirth-- rebirth, that
same element is coming back

00:21:36.160 --> 00:21:42.070 align:middle line:84%
and gets conjugated again with
the experience of the deeper

00:21:42.070 --> 00:21:42.960 align:middle line:90%
level.

[CHIMING]

00:21:45.160 --> 00:21:50.270 align:middle line:84%
Probably, it would be very
difficult, if not impossible,

00:21:50.270 --> 00:21:53.900 align:middle line:84%
to behave coherently
for all people

00:21:53.900 --> 00:21:58.910 align:middle line:84%
if we have a full recall
of our previous lives.

00:21:58.910 --> 00:22:03.990 align:middle line:84%
Some information has to be
lost but not irrevocably

00:22:03.990 --> 00:22:06.340 align:middle line:90%
or unrecoverably lost.

00:22:06.340 --> 00:22:10.610 align:middle line:84%
I think we can recover much,
if not all, of previous lives.

00:22:10.610 --> 00:22:12.690 align:middle line:84%
And there are people
who did have life--

00:22:12.690 --> 00:22:15.040 align:middle line:90%
previous lifetime experiences.

00:22:15.040 --> 00:22:17.506 align:middle line:90%
I believe I have some myself.

00:22:17.506 --> 00:22:19.500 align:middle line:90%
[CHIMING]

00:22:19.500 --> 00:22:23.390 align:middle line:84%
There is a race between
education and disaster.

00:22:23.390 --> 00:22:28.040 align:middle line:84%
Information-- it is the
opening to information

00:22:28.040 --> 00:22:33.020 align:middle line:84%
so that we all become
mystics to some extent.

00:22:33.020 --> 00:22:37.360 align:middle line:84%
That mystical element
has to be part of our--

00:22:37.360 --> 00:22:39.800 align:middle line:84%
of our consciousness,
part of our mind.

00:22:39.800 --> 00:22:43.425 align:middle line:84%
The reason we deny that, the
reason we ignore that is we

00:22:43.425 --> 00:22:44.840 align:middle line:90%
are afraid of it.

00:22:44.840 --> 00:22:50.360 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't fit into our
everyday reality concept.

00:22:50.360 --> 00:22:54.560 align:middle line:84%
So the question is how
to open us in such a way

00:22:54.560 --> 00:22:57.830 align:middle line:84%
that there is a mystical element
in our consciousness, which

00:22:57.830 --> 00:23:03.230 align:middle line:84%
means the element beyond
sensory input, an element that

00:23:03.230 --> 00:23:04.670 align:middle line:90%
is transcendental.

00:23:04.670 --> 00:23:06.590 align:middle line:90%
Psychiatrists discover that.

00:23:06.590 --> 00:23:08.470 align:middle line:90%
They know that.

00:23:08.470 --> 00:23:11.080 align:middle line:84%
Artists know it, and
they act like it.

00:23:11.080 --> 00:23:13.150 align:middle line:84%
Scientists, the
great scientists,

00:23:13.150 --> 00:23:16.120 align:middle line:84%
are beginning to
recognize it, you know?

00:23:16.120 --> 00:23:22.600 align:middle line:84%
The general run of the mill of
society or layers of society,

00:23:22.600 --> 00:23:26.140 align:middle line:84%
so far, they refuse
to take it seriously

00:23:26.140 --> 00:23:28.300 align:middle line:90%
because it's inconvenient.

00:23:28.300 --> 00:23:31.690 align:middle line:84%
It's an inconvenient
truth, in a way,

00:23:31.690 --> 00:23:35.620 align:middle line:84%
because it doesn't
fit as what we know--

00:23:35.620 --> 00:23:37.270 align:middle line:90%
we think we know.

00:23:37.270 --> 00:23:39.370 align:middle line:84%
But it's a deeper
reality that we have

00:23:39.370 --> 00:23:42.640 align:middle line:90%
to know and take seriously.

00:23:42.640 --> 00:23:46.140 align:middle line:84%
And then we can live
in a better way.

00:23:46.140 --> 00:23:50.290 align:middle line:84%
We can live more aligned
with the world around us.

00:23:50.290 --> 00:23:52.650 align:middle line:90%
Information is everywhere.

00:23:52.650 --> 00:23:55.920 align:middle line:84%
This information, which
is behind all things,

00:23:55.920 --> 00:23:58.750 align:middle line:84%
is like a holographic
information.

00:23:58.750 --> 00:23:59.680 align:middle line:90%
It's there.

00:23:59.680 --> 00:24:00.610 align:middle line:90%
It's distributed.

00:24:00.610 --> 00:24:02.090 align:middle line:90%
It's everywhere.

00:24:02.090 --> 00:24:05.380 align:middle line:84%
So what we need to
resort to is this idea

00:24:05.380 --> 00:24:09.040 align:middle line:84%
of the cosmos as a
holographic information

00:24:09.040 --> 00:24:14.470 align:middle line:84%
field that affects the
everyday level, the surface

00:24:14.470 --> 00:24:16.570 align:middle line:90%
level of information.

00:24:16.570 --> 00:24:20.590 align:middle line:84%
So what is there is
the information which

00:24:20.590 --> 00:24:24.370 align:middle line:84%
is expressed in the laws of
nature, is expressed in memory.

00:24:24.370 --> 00:24:26.940 align:middle line:84%
And expressed in all
things that we experience,

00:24:26.940 --> 00:24:29.300 align:middle line:84%
there's this element
of information.

00:24:29.300 --> 00:24:32.205 align:middle line:84%
And that-- that
information is directional.

00:24:32.205 --> 00:24:33.260 align:middle line:90%
It drives.

00:24:33.260 --> 00:24:36.580 align:middle line:84%
It moves us in-- sort
of in a given direction.

00:24:36.580 --> 00:24:46.000 align:middle line:84%
It's not random, and it's
not insignificant or casual.

00:24:46.000 --> 00:24:47.140 align:middle line:90%
It's there.

00:24:47.140 --> 00:24:51.700 align:middle line:84%
It's a-- a cosmos that
provides information

00:24:51.700 --> 00:24:54.880 align:middle line:84%
for a universe that
evolves, evolves

00:24:54.880 --> 00:24:57.730 align:middle line:84%
toward higher and higher
levels of integration.

00:24:57.730 --> 00:25:00.370 align:middle line:84%
And possibly, these highest
levels of integration

00:25:00.370 --> 00:25:02.830 align:middle line:84%
lead to a kind of
a cosmic union,

00:25:02.830 --> 00:25:04.980 align:middle line:84%
like the Eastern
religions talk about,

00:25:04.980 --> 00:25:08.230 align:middle line:84%
between the consciousness
that is-- becomes available,

00:25:08.230 --> 00:25:10.780 align:middle line:84%
becomes possible in
the universe at higher

00:25:10.780 --> 00:25:15.310 align:middle line:84%
levels, of that consciousness
to find communion

00:25:15.310 --> 00:25:20.618 align:middle line:84%
with the consciousness, which
is the cosmos itself, nirvana.

[CHIMING]

00:25:23.010 --> 00:25:25.190 align:middle line:84%
I-- in my books,
I've been talking

00:25:25.190 --> 00:25:29.750 align:middle line:84%
about two kinds of purpose
or destiny, a proximal

00:25:29.750 --> 00:25:31.750 align:middle line:90%
and an ultimate.

00:25:31.750 --> 00:25:34.730 align:middle line:84%
The proximal objective
and therefore also mission

00:25:34.730 --> 00:25:39.930 align:middle line:84%
and destiny is to behave
coherently, to become coherent.

00:25:39.930 --> 00:25:43.350 align:middle line:84%
That means relate to each
other in a coherent way.

00:25:43.350 --> 00:25:46.070 align:middle line:84%
Relate to nature
in a coherent way

00:25:46.070 --> 00:25:49.200 align:middle line:84%
so that we become a sphere
of coherence on this planet.

00:25:49.200 --> 00:25:50.660 align:middle line:90%
That's the proximal level.

00:25:50.660 --> 00:25:52.560 align:middle line:90%
But you can ask why.

00:25:52.560 --> 00:25:56.710 align:middle line:84%
What does this serve,
this super coherence?

It serves-- then here, we
come to a mystical dimension.

00:26:00.860 --> 00:26:03.250 align:middle line:84%
It serves we're
ultimately reaching

00:26:03.250 --> 00:26:07.330 align:middle line:84%
that level of evolution
in the consciousness that

00:26:07.330 --> 00:26:11.240 align:middle line:84%
is made possible by this
coherent system on Earth.

00:26:11.240 --> 00:26:17.110 align:middle line:84%
That level of coherence,
that makes possible

00:26:17.110 --> 00:26:22.060 align:middle line:84%
a union with the deep
mind itself so that we

00:26:22.060 --> 00:26:25.680 align:middle line:84%
no longer continue this
evolutionary process.

00:26:25.680 --> 00:26:29.920 align:middle line:84%
At the highest level,
we enter into communion

00:26:29.920 --> 00:26:33.530 align:middle line:84%
with the mind of
the cosmos itself,

00:26:33.530 --> 00:26:35.477 align:middle line:90%

Love is a manifestation of
the action of an attractor.

00:26:43.320 --> 00:26:45.940 align:middle line:84%
Sorry to be seemingly
splitting hairs,

00:26:45.940 --> 00:26:49.330 align:middle line:84%
but I think love
is a phenomenon.

00:26:49.330 --> 00:26:53.310 align:middle line:84%
And their attractor is what
creates this phenomenon.

00:26:53.310 --> 00:26:57.760 align:middle line:84%
The attractor simply means that
there is something predisposed

00:26:57.760 --> 00:27:02.830 align:middle line:84%
in the universe
which moves, enables

00:27:02.830 --> 00:27:07.470 align:middle line:84%
individuals, even seeds
of a tree, you know,

00:27:07.470 --> 00:27:10.630 align:middle line:84%
whatever appears
in this universe,

00:27:10.630 --> 00:27:15.360 align:middle line:84%
to integrate with one another,
to create larger holes,

00:27:15.360 --> 00:27:16.840 align:middle line:90%
integral holes.

00:27:16.840 --> 00:27:20.260 align:middle line:84%
And love is a manifestation
in the human mind

00:27:20.260 --> 00:27:24.792 align:middle line:84%
of this-- of this drive
toward creating holes.

If people are afraid
of consequences,

00:27:30.170 --> 00:27:34.630 align:middle line:84%
if they don't obey, then
they are motivated to obey.

00:27:34.630 --> 00:27:38.690 align:middle line:84%
But I have no good answer
as to what is fear.

00:27:38.690 --> 00:27:40.510 align:middle line:84%
It sounds presumptuous,
but I have

00:27:40.510 --> 00:27:43.900 align:middle line:90%
no real experience with fear.

00:27:43.900 --> 00:27:47.700 align:middle line:84%
Of course, I fear if somebody
would pull a knife at me.

00:27:47.700 --> 00:27:49.960 align:middle line:90%
I will be fearsome.

00:27:49.960 --> 00:27:53.320 align:middle line:84%
I fear sometimes of missing
a plane because something

00:27:53.320 --> 00:27:55.360 align:middle line:90%
has happened on the way.

00:27:55.360 --> 00:28:01.210 align:middle line:84%
But I-- fear itself is not
an element of my experience.

00:28:01.210 --> 00:28:03.820 align:middle line:90%
So I can't really answer that.

00:28:03.820 --> 00:28:05.410 align:middle line:90%
I think what happens--

00:28:05.410 --> 00:28:09.130 align:middle line:84%
I always believe that what
happens has a reason to it.

00:28:09.130 --> 00:28:11.560 align:middle line:84%
And it's better to
understand the reason

00:28:11.560 --> 00:28:14.670 align:middle line:84%
than just simply fear
the consequences.

00:28:14.670 --> 00:28:15.970 align:middle line:90%
I suppose the unknown--

00:28:15.970 --> 00:28:17.860 align:middle line:84%
why people fear what
they don't understand

00:28:17.860 --> 00:28:24.130 align:middle line:84%
is the unknown holds a
deeply embedded fear.

00:28:24.130 --> 00:28:28.960 align:middle line:84%
I think that comes to us, if I
would try to give an anthropo--

00:28:28.960 --> 00:28:31.620 align:middle line:84%
anthropomorphic
explanation of this,

00:28:31.620 --> 00:28:34.540 align:middle line:84%
it has to do probably
with the animals howling

00:28:34.540 --> 00:28:36.970 align:middle line:90%
outside our cave.

00:28:36.970 --> 00:28:39.100 align:middle line:90%
It's something out there.

00:28:39.100 --> 00:28:41.950 align:middle line:90%
That is a primeval fear.

00:28:41.950 --> 00:28:43.420 align:middle line:90%
And I can experience that.

00:28:43.420 --> 00:28:47.560 align:middle line:90%
I can-- I can appreciate that.

00:28:47.560 --> 00:28:49.860 align:middle line:90%
But I don't let it in, in a way.

00:28:49.860 --> 00:28:54.070 align:middle line:84%
I don't let it bias my
thinking and my feeling

00:28:54.070 --> 00:28:56.780 align:middle line:84%
because I know it's
something primeval.

00:28:56.780 --> 00:28:58.110 align:middle line:90%
It's something there.

00:28:58.110 --> 00:29:02.500 align:middle line:84%
We are not beings that have
their existence assured

00:29:02.500 --> 00:29:05.020 align:middle line:90%
for the rest of our lifetime.

00:29:05.020 --> 00:29:09.550 align:middle line:84%
But once said that, I
can go past it, you know?

00:29:09.550 --> 00:29:11.550 align:middle line:90%
So it's an irrational factor.

00:29:11.550 --> 00:29:13.090 align:middle line:90%
Fear is irrational.

00:29:13.090 --> 00:29:16.221 align:middle line:84%
And it's highly dangerous to
let it dominate your life.

[CHIMING]

00:29:19.450 --> 00:29:23.140 align:middle line:84%
It's-- to some extent, I
know that the existence that

00:29:23.140 --> 00:29:27.970 align:middle line:84%
I've built up here will
not continue in this form.

00:29:27.970 --> 00:29:31.090 align:middle line:84%
And I also know that
another kind of an existence

00:29:31.090 --> 00:29:34.210 align:middle line:84%
will take its place,
but it's a big change.

00:29:34.210 --> 00:29:36.620 align:middle line:90%
I'm afraid of it the same way--

00:29:36.620 --> 00:29:38.400 align:middle line:90%
which is not a real fear--

00:29:38.400 --> 00:29:42.950 align:middle line:84%
that I will be actually afraid
of moving to another city.

00:29:42.950 --> 00:29:45.830 align:middle line:90%
It's a change of venue.

00:29:45.830 --> 00:29:50.290 align:middle line:84%
But I'm not afraid of it
as-- as the end of something.
