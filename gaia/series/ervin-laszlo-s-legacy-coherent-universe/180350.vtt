00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:29.140 align:middle line:10%
>> When my great friend the
brilliant director Jay Weidner

00:00:29.140 --> 00:00:33.850 align:middle line:10%
came to me on behalf of Gaia
network to suggest that I

00:00:33.850 --> 00:00:38.170 align:middle line:10%
record a series of shows,
all under the general heading

00:00:38.170 --> 00:00:42.670 align:middle line:10%
of "Legacy," first I
asked myself, well,

00:00:42.670 --> 00:00:44.060 align:middle line:10%
does that make sense?

00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:44.860 align:middle line:90%
Why?

00:00:44.860 --> 00:00:47.380 align:middle line:84%
I've already published
a lot of books.

00:00:47.380 --> 00:00:49.350 align:middle line:90%
You can look at those.

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:52.420 align:middle line:84%
Then I sat there thinking, yes,
this is perhaps an occasion

00:00:52.420 --> 00:00:56.820 align:middle line:84%
to summarize, also for
myself, what I have done,

00:00:56.820 --> 00:01:00.600 align:middle line:84%
what I've accomplished
or failed to accomplish.

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:04.260 align:middle line:84%
And so to ask myself
some serious questions.

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:08.870 align:middle line:84%
So let me now speculate just
for a few minutes on the answers

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:11.640 align:middle line:90%
that I've come up with.

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:14.420 align:middle line:84%
First of all, the
question I ask myself,

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:17.150 align:middle line:90%
why did I do what I did?

00:01:17.150 --> 00:01:20.810 align:middle line:84%
Why did I inquire
into these issues that

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:24.320 align:middle line:90%
have occupied most of my life?

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:28.140 align:middle line:84%
What did I hope to
accomplish by that?

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:31.920 align:middle line:84%
Well, I should add that
this why has very much

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:38.180 align:middle line:84%
to do with my experience, life
experience from childhood on.

00:01:38.180 --> 00:01:41.430 align:middle line:84%
As some of our
viewers might know,

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:44.320 align:middle line:84%
I have started my
professional life

00:01:44.320 --> 00:01:48.240 align:middle line:90%
in this lifetime as a musician.

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:51.800 align:middle line:10%
And my experience as,
first a piano prodigy,

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:55.380 align:middle line:10%
started at the age of
nine to play concerts,

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:59.940 align:middle line:10%
and then as a serious musician
for touring the world,

00:01:59.940 --> 00:02:03.930 align:middle line:10%
my experience playing
to public, to audiences

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:05.970 align:middle line:10%
was a remarkable one.

00:02:05.970 --> 00:02:08.250 align:middle line:90%
It's not an ordinary experience.

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:11.039 align:middle line:84%
When things really
work, you move

00:02:11.039 --> 00:02:13.690 align:middle line:90%
into another sphere in music.

00:02:13.690 --> 00:02:16.485 align:middle line:84%
You become one with
the public and so

00:02:16.485 --> 00:02:19.040 align:middle line:84%
the people, as
individuals, disappear.

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:24.090 align:middle line:84%
We are all a resonance,
vibrating field, together

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:26.910 align:middle line:84%
beyond any ordinary
bounds of space and time.

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:30.750 align:middle line:84%
We can go anywhere we want,
and we feel anything we want.

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:32.940 align:middle line:90%
There are no limits to that.

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:35.200 align:middle line:90%
This is when it really works.

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:39.390 align:middle line:84%
Then you are on this high,
on this great aesthetic

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:43.080 align:middle line:84%
experience, the
catharsis, perhaps.

00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:45.930 align:middle line:84%
So I had that
experience, and I always

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:50.110 align:middle line:84%
suspected that this
is not accidental.

00:02:50.110 --> 00:02:52.050 align:middle line:84%
It's something--
there is something

00:02:52.050 --> 00:02:57.390 align:middle line:84%
in truth in the world that
allows these experiences,

00:02:57.390 --> 00:03:01.000 align:middle line:84%
and that they have a
root in the real world.

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:02.960 align:middle line:84%
So I started asking,
what are they?

00:03:02.960 --> 00:03:05.670 align:middle line:84%
What kind of a world
is this in which

00:03:05.670 --> 00:03:11.295 align:middle line:84%
one can experience wholeness and
oneness and a higher dimension,

00:03:11.295 --> 00:03:14.400 align:middle line:90%
or perhaps a deeper dimension?

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:19.000 align:middle line:84%
And I started
trying for answers.

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:21.890 align:middle line:84%
Now, here I must,
right away, follow up

00:03:21.890 --> 00:03:25.560 align:middle line:84%
this little introspection
that I'm doing now.

00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:29.920 align:middle line:84%
The answers I gave were
not limited by convention.

00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:30.720 align:middle line:90%
Why?

00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:34.590 align:middle line:84%
Because for the very reason that
I was asking these questions,

00:03:34.590 --> 00:03:38.880 align:middle line:84%
I also had no limits in
trying to give the answers,

00:03:38.880 --> 00:03:42.990 align:middle line:84%
because I did not lead
a conventional life.

00:03:42.990 --> 00:03:45.990 align:middle line:84%
From the time I was
discovered, so to say,

00:03:45.990 --> 00:03:50.140 align:middle line:84%
so to speak, as
a musical talent,

00:03:50.140 --> 00:03:56.750 align:middle line:84%
I have not been part of any
standard life expectancy, life

00:03:56.750 --> 00:03:59.530 align:middle line:90%
style, life community.

00:03:59.530 --> 00:04:03.400 align:middle line:84%
I have lived a bit
outside of the box.

00:04:03.400 --> 00:04:05.770 align:middle line:84%
Even as a child, I
was considered already

00:04:05.770 --> 00:04:09.880 align:middle line:84%
a piano prodigy and did
not visit at school.

00:04:09.880 --> 00:04:12.010 align:middle line:90%
But I was a private student.

00:04:12.010 --> 00:04:16.870 align:middle line:84%
I just went for the exams
at the end of the term,

00:04:16.870 --> 00:04:20.000 align:middle line:84%
and otherwise, I did
the studies on my own.

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:22.760 align:middle line:84%
And I worked with my mother,
who was a piano teacher,

00:04:22.760 --> 00:04:26.360 align:middle line:84%
and who had ambitions herself
for becoming a concert pianist.

00:04:26.360 --> 00:04:28.870 align:middle line:84%
But she started
in life too late,

00:04:28.870 --> 00:04:31.930 align:middle line:84%
and her family was not
enough understanding for what

00:04:31.930 --> 00:04:33.610 align:middle line:90%
she really wanted.

00:04:33.610 --> 00:04:36.760 align:middle line:84%
And if one starts much later
than seven or eight or nine

00:04:36.760 --> 00:04:40.420 align:middle line:84%
years old to work on an
instrument like the piano,

00:04:40.420 --> 00:04:44.020 align:middle line:84%
you cannot make it to this level
of perfection that you need

00:04:44.020 --> 00:04:45.070 align:middle line:90%
as a concert pianist.

00:04:45.070 --> 00:04:48.220 align:middle line:84%
So she took it out on
her son, so to speak.

00:04:48.220 --> 00:04:51.130 align:middle line:84%
She expected me to
become a concert pianist,

00:04:51.130 --> 00:04:53.920 align:middle line:90%
and this start like that, also.

00:04:53.920 --> 00:04:58.680 align:middle line:84%
Now, the questions that I
asked then were out of the box,

00:04:58.680 --> 00:05:02.400 align:middle line:84%
were not the standard question,
not limited by anything.

00:05:02.400 --> 00:05:05.920 align:middle line:84%
I asked, what kind
of a world is this?

00:05:05.920 --> 00:05:11.120 align:middle line:84%
And I did not accept
any standard answer.

00:05:11.120 --> 00:05:16.940 align:middle line:84%
It was any answer I would get
from books, from conversations,

00:05:16.940 --> 00:05:19.870 align:middle line:84%
I would always ask, does
that really make sense?

00:05:19.870 --> 00:05:23.540 align:middle line:84%
And being a musician,
you are very intuitive.

00:05:23.540 --> 00:05:26.410 align:middle line:84%
You know how to rely
on your intuition.

00:05:26.410 --> 00:05:28.000 align:middle line:90%
Does it sound good?

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:31.610 align:middle line:90%
Is it really likely to be true?

00:05:31.610 --> 00:05:34.530 align:middle line:84%
What does one really
feel about it, you know?

00:05:34.530 --> 00:05:36.870 align:middle line:84%
So I asked these questions,
and I tested them

00:05:36.870 --> 00:05:39.180 align:middle line:90%
against my feelings.

00:05:39.180 --> 00:05:45.220 align:middle line:84%
So I was wide-ranging answers,
wide-ranging inquirer.

00:05:45.220 --> 00:05:48.670 align:middle line:84%
Is this world really
a material sphere?

00:05:48.670 --> 00:05:50.860 align:middle line:84%
Is this one limited
to bodies moving

00:05:50.860 --> 00:05:54.270 align:middle line:90%
about in space and in time?

00:05:54.270 --> 00:05:55.710 align:middle line:90%
Is there more to it?

00:05:55.710 --> 00:05:58.980 align:middle line:84%
Is everything we know coming
to us through our senses?

00:05:58.980 --> 00:06:02.190 align:middle line:90%
Could there be more to it?

00:06:02.190 --> 00:06:06.090 align:middle line:84%
And these questions led
me to different concepts.

00:06:06.090 --> 00:06:10.680 align:middle line:84%
First, to the idea of-- which
nowadays is very much known,

00:06:10.680 --> 00:06:13.400 align:middle line:90%
but it wasn't at the time--

00:06:13.400 --> 00:06:17.520 align:middle line:84%
namely of interaction,
interdependence,

00:06:17.520 --> 00:06:20.260 align:middle line:84%
of the kind of world
where everything

00:06:20.260 --> 00:06:22.680 align:middle line:90%
affects everything else.

00:06:22.680 --> 00:06:25.100 align:middle line:84%
I was thinking, if I
have these experiences,

00:06:25.100 --> 00:06:28.910 align:middle line:84%
perhaps they are part of
a chain of experiences

00:06:28.910 --> 00:06:31.970 align:middle line:84%
that are rooted in
reality, which itself

00:06:31.970 --> 00:06:37.270 align:middle line:84%
is a chain of events, all
things connected, and together

00:06:37.270 --> 00:06:40.610 align:middle line:84%
producing this
experience that we have.

00:06:40.610 --> 00:06:44.870 align:middle line:84%
So maybe our experience is
not just limited to the here

00:06:44.870 --> 00:06:50.510 align:middle line:84%
and now what we perceive with
our eyes or ears, et cetera.

00:06:50.510 --> 00:06:56.720 align:middle line:84%
So I did not hesitate to
explore this possibility.

00:06:56.720 --> 00:07:01.220 align:middle line:84%
The experience I had in music
was beyond the ordinary bounds

00:07:01.220 --> 00:07:04.070 align:middle line:84%
of the senses, and I
asked, what kind of a world

00:07:04.070 --> 00:07:09.720 align:middle line:84%
is it in which such
experiences can come about?

00:07:09.720 --> 00:07:11.990 align:middle line:84%
Truly, the first
concept that came

00:07:11.990 --> 00:07:16.730 align:middle line:84%
is that beyond, above
or below, someplace,

00:07:16.730 --> 00:07:18.920 align:middle line:84%
somehow beyond
the everyday world

00:07:18.920 --> 00:07:22.640 align:middle line:84%
that we experience, there
is another reality, a higher

00:07:22.640 --> 00:07:24.990 align:middle line:90%
reality, a transcendent reality.

00:07:24.990 --> 00:07:29.510 align:middle line:84%
Now, I was not about to go into
any religious dogma or doctrine

00:07:29.510 --> 00:07:31.220 align:middle line:90%
and say, well, this is it.

00:07:31.220 --> 00:07:33.020 align:middle line:90%
This has been written over here.

00:07:33.020 --> 00:07:34.880 align:middle line:90%
This is how it must be.

00:07:34.880 --> 00:07:38.180 align:middle line:84%
Because I was asking
questions out of the box,

00:07:38.180 --> 00:07:43.730 align:middle line:84%
I was not ready to accept any
prepackaged answer as it were.

00:07:43.730 --> 00:07:45.390 align:middle line:90%
So I explored.

00:07:45.390 --> 00:07:48.160 align:middle line:84%
What kind of a
world could that be?

00:07:48.160 --> 00:07:53.960 align:middle line:84%
And the answers that I came up
with were more based on process

00:07:53.960 --> 00:08:00.680 align:middle line:84%
than on existence, more
on becoming than on being.

00:08:00.680 --> 00:08:04.400 align:middle line:84%
Constantly things are moving,
constantly developing,

00:08:04.400 --> 00:08:06.440 align:middle line:90%
constantly evolving.

00:08:06.440 --> 00:08:08.210 align:middle line:90%
Things are not what they are.

00:08:08.210 --> 00:08:10.050 align:middle line:90%
Things are what become--

00:08:10.050 --> 00:08:13.630 align:middle line:84%
Things are how they
relate to others.

00:08:13.630 --> 00:08:18.980 align:middle line:10%
Then I discovered some
philosophies and though

00:08:18.980 --> 00:08:21.440 align:middle line:10%
and thinkers, for
example, the process

00:08:21.440 --> 00:08:24.320 align:middle line:10%
thinkers like Alfred
North Whitehead, who

00:08:24.320 --> 00:08:27.770 align:middle line:10%
said that a thing in the
world is what it is because

00:08:27.770 --> 00:08:30.540 align:middle line:10%
of its relation to
everything else,

00:08:30.540 --> 00:08:34.880 align:middle line:10%
and it is also something
that is constantly becoming.

00:08:34.880 --> 00:08:39.830 align:middle line:84%
So my first concept was this
relational becoming, relational

00:08:39.830 --> 00:08:42.679 align:middle line:84%
interdependence, and
to my great amazement,

00:08:42.679 --> 00:08:46.690 align:middle line:84%
I discovered that this is the
Buddhist notion of reality.

00:08:46.690 --> 00:08:52.260 align:middle line:84%
Interdependent co-origination
it's called in the Buddhist

00:08:52.260 --> 00:08:53.640 align:middle line:90%
philosophy.

00:08:53.640 --> 00:08:56.290 align:middle line:84%
I didn't know that others
were thinking like this.

00:08:56.290 --> 00:08:58.070 align:middle line:84%
There's a whole
tradition like this.

00:08:58.070 --> 00:09:01.480 align:middle line:84%
I started exploring
this more and more.

00:09:01.480 --> 00:09:04.460 align:middle line:84%
I had a number of experiences
that I will recount, perhaps,

00:09:04.460 --> 00:09:07.850 align:middle line:84%
in a moment, but
the gist of it was

00:09:07.850 --> 00:09:11.300 align:middle line:84%
that I moved from the idea of
single things moving in space

00:09:11.300 --> 00:09:14.240 align:middle line:84%
and time to the idea
of things so related

00:09:14.240 --> 00:09:18.230 align:middle line:84%
together that they make each
other, they create each other.

00:09:18.230 --> 00:09:20.420 align:middle line:84%
They become what they are
because of each other,

00:09:20.420 --> 00:09:22.200 align:middle line:90%
you know?

00:09:22.200 --> 00:09:25.430 align:middle line:84%
And this has to be
embedded in something.

00:09:25.430 --> 00:09:28.910 align:middle line:84%
Reality had to have
a basis is something.

00:09:28.910 --> 00:09:30.380 align:middle line:84%
So then the question
I asked, what

00:09:30.380 --> 00:09:33.960 align:middle line:90%
is this reality grounded in?

00:09:33.960 --> 00:09:36.700 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to say it's not
grounded in anything hard,

00:09:36.700 --> 00:09:41.170 align:middle line:84%
feeling like some solid
rock or whatever, you know?

00:09:41.170 --> 00:09:42.920 align:middle line:84%
It had to be grounded
in something fluid

00:09:42.920 --> 00:09:45.790 align:middle line:90%
but yet meaningful.

00:09:45.790 --> 00:09:48.850 align:middle line:84%
I came across but later,
when I came across

00:09:48.850 --> 00:09:52.014 align:middle line:84%
in my inquiry, the
idea of a field.

00:09:52.014 --> 00:09:55.015 align:middle line:84%
A field is-- nowadays we
speak very much more of field

00:09:55.015 --> 00:09:58.280 align:middle line:84%
because it's an age of
technology, of information.

00:09:58.280 --> 00:10:00.430 align:middle line:90%
This was before that.

00:10:00.430 --> 00:10:03.430 align:middle line:84%
So it's a fairly new
idea, but in the sciences,

00:10:03.430 --> 00:10:06.930 align:middle line:84%
especially in biology,
it was already

00:10:06.930 --> 00:10:09.340 align:middle line:84%
existing, already
started up, this notion

00:10:09.340 --> 00:10:14.300 align:middle line:84%
of a field in which the organism
appears, a field of life.

00:10:14.300 --> 00:10:18.540 align:middle line:84%
Also going back again
to ancient traditions,

00:10:18.540 --> 00:10:23.180 align:middle line:84%
a field in which all
living things can evolve.

00:10:23.180 --> 00:10:25.180 align:middle line:84%
But could it be a
single field or would it

00:10:25.180 --> 00:10:28.480 align:middle line:84%
be part of the overall
field of the world,

00:10:28.480 --> 00:10:32.710 align:middle line:84%
of the reality in which
these experiences are

00:10:32.710 --> 00:10:35.610 align:middle line:90%
field experiences?

00:10:35.610 --> 00:10:40.990 align:middle line:84%
I moved from there to the
idea that all this field

00:10:40.990 --> 00:10:44.260 align:middle line:84%
is basically not something
solid and material.

00:10:44.260 --> 00:10:45.490 align:middle line:90%
It's real, all right.

00:10:45.490 --> 00:10:48.760 align:middle line:84%
It's real, but it's
not something concrete,

00:10:48.760 --> 00:10:52.260 align:middle line:84%
cannot be limited
to the here and now.

00:10:52.260 --> 00:10:55.770 align:middle line:84%
But think what happens in
this field at any one part

00:10:55.770 --> 00:10:57.590 align:middle line:84%
also happening in
these other parts.

00:10:57.590 --> 00:11:00.100 align:middle line:90%
It's all happening together.

00:11:00.100 --> 00:11:02.630 align:middle line:90%
It's all evolving as one thing.

00:11:02.630 --> 00:11:07.081 align:middle line:84%
Now, this was, just recall, way
before the quantum revolution.

00:11:07.081 --> 00:11:10.510 align:middle line:90%
It was in the 1950s, 1960s.

00:11:10.510 --> 00:11:12.770 align:middle line:84%
Some scientists already
had these notions,

00:11:12.770 --> 00:11:17.640 align:middle line:84%
but the wide quantum revolution
at the end of the 20th century

00:11:17.640 --> 00:11:20.470 align:middle line:90%
didn't arrive yet at that time.

00:11:20.470 --> 00:11:24.100 align:middle line:84%
So I asked myself,
could this field

00:11:24.100 --> 00:11:28.910 align:middle line:84%
be a psychic field,
a mental field?

00:11:28.910 --> 00:11:32.680 align:middle line:84%
But I did not like, finally,
the idea that we just

00:11:32.680 --> 00:11:36.250 align:middle line:84%
have to give up our
notions of reality

00:11:36.250 --> 00:11:38.720 align:middle line:90%
and say everything is a thought.

00:11:38.720 --> 00:11:40.780 align:middle line:84%
If it's a thought,
if it's an idea,

00:11:40.780 --> 00:11:43.600 align:middle line:84%
also that must be rooted
in something that produces

00:11:43.600 --> 00:11:45.950 align:middle line:90%
that thought, that idea.

00:11:45.950 --> 00:11:50.120 align:middle line:84%
So the field as an
informational reality,

00:11:50.120 --> 00:11:53.000 align:middle line:84%
that was then the next
step and probably,

00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:55.770 align:middle line:84%
that's where I'm
still today, someplace

00:11:55.770 --> 00:12:02.560 align:middle line:84%
where I think that the world
is running on information,

00:12:02.560 --> 00:12:05.920 align:middle line:84%
and the field is primarily
energy of a particular kind.

00:12:05.920 --> 00:12:09.370 align:middle line:84%
Not a random energy, but
highly-focused energy

00:12:09.370 --> 00:12:11.670 align:middle line:90%
moving in a given direction.

00:12:11.670 --> 00:12:16.310 align:middle line:84%
Now, this to me, has always
been very intriguing.

00:12:16.310 --> 00:12:20.510 align:middle line:84%
I might also say satisfactory,
because it gives answers

00:12:20.510 --> 00:12:23.600 align:middle line:84%
to the question,
why are we here,

00:12:23.600 --> 00:12:26.060 align:middle line:90%
and also where are we going?

00:12:26.060 --> 00:12:29.810 align:middle line:84%
Because the answer to why
we are here is to go where

00:12:29.810 --> 00:12:31.800 align:middle line:90%
we are meant to go.

00:12:31.800 --> 00:12:34.590 align:middle line:84%
So if there is a purpose
underlying things,

00:12:34.590 --> 00:12:36.770 align:middle line:84%
then we are here
as an instrument

00:12:36.770 --> 00:12:40.240 align:middle line:90%
to fulfill that purpose.

00:12:40.240 --> 00:12:44.930 align:middle line:84%
Maybe the instrument is our
thinking, is our consciousness,

00:12:44.930 --> 00:12:49.820 align:middle line:84%
is our mind, but it is here
to explore a reality which

00:12:49.820 --> 00:12:51.550 align:middle line:90%
is also beyond that.

00:12:51.550 --> 00:12:55.400 align:middle line:84%
This, which is connected,
but it's not limited to that.

00:12:55.400 --> 00:12:58.080 align:middle line:84%
There is a reality
beyond the mind.

00:12:58.080 --> 00:13:02.840 align:middle line:84%
Of course, I started reading
major philosophers, East

00:13:02.840 --> 00:13:08.060 align:middle line:84%
and West, and discovered that
what I am thinking of exploring

00:13:08.060 --> 00:13:10.820 align:middle line:84%
has been known for thousands
of years, has been explored,

00:13:10.820 --> 00:13:12.200 align:middle line:90%
developed.

00:13:12.200 --> 00:13:15.620 align:middle line:84%
But I did it, I think,
in the right order.

00:13:15.620 --> 00:13:18.670 align:middle line:84%
Most students of
philosophy and of science,

00:13:18.670 --> 00:13:23.300 align:middle line:84%
but especially philosophy,
work in the wrong order.

00:13:23.300 --> 00:13:26.760 align:middle line:84%
They get the answers before
they pose the questions.

00:13:26.760 --> 00:13:30.530 align:middle line:84%
When you go to an academy,
to a school, to a university,

00:13:30.530 --> 00:13:34.820 align:middle line:84%
you're being taught all kinds
of doctrines and answers

00:13:34.820 --> 00:13:37.670 align:middle line:84%
to questions that
you didn't ask.

00:13:37.670 --> 00:13:40.610 align:middle line:84%
The real philosophy, I
think, the real insight

00:13:40.610 --> 00:13:45.410 align:middle line:84%
comes from asking and
asking the kind of questions

00:13:45.410 --> 00:13:51.830 align:middle line:84%
that I've been asking myself
in a very presumptuous way.

00:13:51.830 --> 00:13:58.430 align:middle line:10%
Because in my early 20s,
mid-20s and late 20s,

00:13:58.430 --> 00:14:00.710 align:middle line:10%
I somehow had the
idea that if I am

00:14:00.710 --> 00:14:04.190 align:middle line:10%
serious about posing
this question,

00:14:04.190 --> 00:14:07.250 align:middle line:10%
then I come to insights, even
though everything has already

00:14:07.250 --> 00:14:09.799 align:middle line:10%
been explored and written about.

00:14:09.799 --> 00:14:11.840 align:middle line:84%
Maybe I can come up with
something new, certainly

00:14:11.840 --> 00:14:15.860 align:middle line:84%
something that will
satisfy me more.

00:14:15.860 --> 00:14:18.950 align:middle line:84%
It's a presumption I would
hesitate to undertake today,

00:14:18.950 --> 00:14:21.080 align:middle line:84%
but I still believe
that there are things

00:14:21.080 --> 00:14:23.570 align:middle line:90%
to be explored, to discover.

00:14:23.570 --> 00:14:26.690 align:middle line:84%
But at that time, I
looked at the world

00:14:26.690 --> 00:14:30.230 align:middle line:84%
as an open area for
exploration, something

00:14:30.230 --> 00:14:32.690 align:middle line:90%
that you could get to know.

00:14:32.690 --> 00:14:35.190 align:middle line:84%
And then you get to
know, you get the world

00:14:35.190 --> 00:14:37.200 align:middle line:90%
that you get to know yourself.

00:14:37.200 --> 00:14:39.530 align:middle line:90%
Because this idea that I--

00:14:39.530 --> 00:14:43.420 align:middle line:84%
I'm speaking of myself in
this self-exploration mode,

00:14:43.420 --> 00:14:48.320 align:middle line:84%
because I, myself, am very much
a part of what I experience.

00:14:48.320 --> 00:14:51.140 align:middle line:84%
I'm out here and what I
experience being over there.

00:14:51.140 --> 00:14:54.620 align:middle line:90%
I am the experience.

00:14:54.620 --> 00:14:57.110 align:middle line:84%
And I evolve, because
the world evolves.

00:14:57.110 --> 00:14:59.650 align:middle line:90%
I become something.

00:14:59.650 --> 00:15:02.860 align:middle line:84%
And this process philosophy,
applied to the mind,

00:15:02.860 --> 00:15:05.190 align:middle line:84%
didn't become for me
a kind of idealism,

00:15:05.190 --> 00:15:09.210 align:middle line:84%
where it says that all there is,
is mind and everything is mind.

00:15:09.210 --> 00:15:10.800 align:middle line:90%
Mind is an element of this.

00:15:10.800 --> 00:15:13.690 align:middle line:84%
The consciousness is
an element of this.

00:15:13.690 --> 00:15:17.220 align:middle line:84%
But the whole thing cannot
be said is purely mind,

00:15:17.220 --> 00:15:20.160 align:middle line:84%
anymore than it's said it's
probably purely matter,

00:15:20.160 --> 00:15:21.240 align:middle line:90%
all things.

00:15:21.240 --> 00:15:24.390 align:middle line:90%
It's something beyond all that.

00:15:24.390 --> 00:15:29.290 align:middle line:84%
And then strangely, or perhaps
not so strangely, I ended up--

00:15:29.290 --> 00:15:31.530 align:middle line:84%
up till now, at least,
up to this point,

00:15:31.530 --> 00:15:35.040 align:middle line:84%
because I want to evolve,
continue to think about this--

00:15:35.040 --> 00:15:40.210 align:middle line:84%
I ended up with something like
Oriental or basic mysticism,

00:15:40.210 --> 00:15:46.090 align:middle line:84%
the idea that the fundamental
element of the universe

00:15:46.090 --> 00:15:52.390 align:middle line:84%
is a mystical intelligence, is
an intelligence that decides,

00:15:52.390 --> 00:15:55.470 align:middle line:90%
that conducts, that guides.

00:15:55.470 --> 00:15:58.490 align:middle line:84%
It governs, but in a
cybernetic sense of governing,

00:15:58.490 --> 00:16:04.780 align:middle line:84%
as a governing function,
guides the way things evolve.

00:16:04.780 --> 00:16:07.630 align:middle line:84%
There is something that is
being realized in this world.

00:16:07.630 --> 00:16:10.330 align:middle line:84%
There's something that is
becoming in the world, which

00:16:10.330 --> 00:16:14.470 align:middle line:84%
is bigger than you and me, which
is bigger than any human being,

00:16:14.470 --> 00:16:19.030 align:middle line:84%
but it is something that
we can try to explore.

00:16:19.030 --> 00:16:21.340 align:middle line:84%
We will never get
to the bottom of it,

00:16:21.340 --> 00:16:24.340 align:middle line:84%
but we will understand,
perhaps, a little bit,

00:16:24.340 --> 00:16:26.480 align:middle line:90%
always a little bit more.

00:16:26.480 --> 00:16:28.570 align:middle line:84%
And this understanding
can give us

00:16:28.570 --> 00:16:32.660 align:middle line:84%
answers as to who we are, why
we are here, where we come from,

00:16:32.660 --> 00:16:35.830 align:middle line:90%
where we are going.

00:16:35.830 --> 00:16:39.470 align:middle line:84%
Included in this
exploration is the idea

00:16:39.470 --> 00:16:41.880 align:middle line:84%
that there is more to
the world than what

00:16:41.880 --> 00:16:43.660 align:middle line:90%
we perceive with our senses.

00:16:43.660 --> 00:16:46.810 align:middle line:84%
If you assume that and
you're willing to ask

00:16:46.810 --> 00:16:52.790 align:middle line:84%
for questions without limits,
leading a life out of the box,

00:16:52.790 --> 00:16:55.450 align:middle line:84%
so to speak, where
you don't feel limited

00:16:55.450 --> 00:16:57.520 align:middle line:84%
and you are presumptuous
to the extent

00:16:57.520 --> 00:17:01.720 align:middle line:84%
that you think you can
find answers, then you get,

00:17:01.720 --> 00:17:04.210 align:middle line:84%
I think, to these ideas
that I've gotten to.

00:17:04.210 --> 00:17:07.690 align:middle line:84%
I still believe that these
are the most logical ideas,

00:17:07.690 --> 00:17:10.359 align:middle line:90%
the most coherent ideas.

00:17:10.359 --> 00:17:13.579 align:middle line:84%
The world is really
truly like a great idea,

00:17:13.579 --> 00:17:14.740 align:middle line:90%
but it's not just an idea.

00:17:14.740 --> 00:17:19.810 align:middle line:84%
It's everything that there
is, is idea-like, mental-like.

00:17:19.810 --> 00:17:22.839 align:middle line:84%
It's there, of course, in
all the base philosophies.

00:17:22.839 --> 00:17:26.892 align:middle line:84%
It's been also in Hegel
in wherever you look.

00:17:26.892 --> 00:17:28.670 align:middle line:90%
It's in Eastern philosophies.

00:17:28.670 --> 00:17:30.220 align:middle line:90%
It's all there.

00:17:30.220 --> 00:17:33.730 align:middle line:84%
But I discovered it for
myself, the hard way.

00:17:33.730 --> 00:17:35.670 align:middle line:90%
I asked myself this question.

00:17:35.670 --> 00:17:37.670 align:middle line:84%
I was privileged
in the sense that I

00:17:37.670 --> 00:17:39.010 align:middle line:90%
could ask these questions.

00:17:39.010 --> 00:17:41.970 align:middle line:10%
I had the opportunity.

00:17:41.970 --> 00:17:45.760 align:middle line:84%
I led a life as
a concert pianist

00:17:45.760 --> 00:17:48.450 align:middle line:90%
until I was in my mid-30s.

00:17:48.450 --> 00:17:49.880 align:middle line:90%
I was exploring these questions.

00:17:49.880 --> 00:17:50.680 align:middle line:90%
I was reading.

00:17:50.680 --> 00:17:52.410 align:middle line:90%
I was writing.

00:17:52.410 --> 00:17:54.430 align:middle line:90%
I was publishing, also.

00:17:54.430 --> 00:17:58.690 align:middle line:84%
But I could survive
without being

00:17:58.690 --> 00:18:01.990 align:middle line:90%
forced into more into a box.

00:18:01.990 --> 00:18:06.650 align:middle line:84%
And I'm very grateful to have
had this opportunity to do so.

00:18:06.650 --> 00:18:08.580 align:middle line:10%
And I always
continue doing this.

00:18:08.580 --> 00:18:12.520 align:middle line:10%
I feel it is is part
of my goal in life,

00:18:12.520 --> 00:18:16.300 align:middle line:10%
part of my mission in
life to ask questions

00:18:16.300 --> 00:18:20.830 align:middle line:10%
without limits as to ordinary,
everyday rationality,

00:18:20.830 --> 00:18:25.360 align:middle line:10%
ask questions and explore
where they will take me.

00:18:25.360 --> 00:18:27.015 align:middle line:84%
So this lifestyle,
this exploration,

00:18:27.015 --> 00:18:31.650 align:middle line:84%
which has been going on now
for well over half a century,

00:18:31.650 --> 00:18:35.680 align:middle line:84%
is perhaps my
mission in life, what

00:18:35.680 --> 00:18:39.040 align:middle line:84%
I want to communicate
as my legacy,

00:18:39.040 --> 00:18:41.050 align:middle line:90%
the fruits of this exploration.

00:18:41.050 --> 00:18:44.320 align:middle line:84%
Not because it's a
final answer, but it's

00:18:44.320 --> 00:18:49.320 align:middle line:84%
the answer that somebody who
dared to ask the questions

00:18:49.320 --> 00:18:53.580 align:middle line:84%
and was lucky enough to have
the opportunity to explore,

00:18:53.580 --> 00:18:56.000 align:middle line:90%
to look for answers.

00:18:56.000 --> 00:19:02.050 align:middle line:84%
These are the answers that
I've come up in this lifetime.

00:19:02.050 --> 00:19:07.040 align:middle line:84%
I should add that I believe that
this is not the only lifetime,

00:19:07.040 --> 00:19:12.160 align:middle line:84%
that these explorations,
that this adventure of mine

00:19:12.160 --> 00:19:17.830 align:middle line:84%
in the universe will continue
beyond any individual lifetime,

00:19:17.830 --> 00:19:21.460 align:middle line:84%
and that perhaps
the one lifetime can

00:19:21.460 --> 00:19:24.130 align:middle line:90%
prepare the ground for another.

00:19:24.130 --> 00:19:27.610 align:middle line:84%
And so then, let's address
this one last issue, question

00:19:27.610 --> 00:19:32.350 align:middle line:84%
about why I was engaging
in these explorations?

00:19:32.350 --> 00:19:36.700 align:middle line:84%
Because I've come to
believe, cautiously believe,

00:19:36.700 --> 00:19:43.000 align:middle line:84%
not automatically, that what
I'm doing now in this lifetime

00:19:43.000 --> 00:19:46.165 align:middle line:84%
will affect my future
lifetimes and will

00:19:46.165 --> 00:19:50.830 align:middle line:84%
affect the lives of others,
now and in the future.

00:19:50.830 --> 00:19:54.980 align:middle line:84%
That we are sufficiently
interdependent, interacting,

00:19:54.980 --> 00:19:57.830 align:middle line:90%
sufficiently co-evolving.

00:19:57.830 --> 00:20:00.130 align:middle line:84%
So what happens
to one, especially

00:20:00.130 --> 00:20:05.210 align:middle line:84%
to one consciousness, one
mind, also affects others.

00:20:05.210 --> 00:20:07.990 align:middle line:84%
So if I come up
with some answers,

00:20:07.990 --> 00:20:13.360 align:middle line:84%
some hunches as to what this
bigger reality that we call

00:20:13.360 --> 00:20:17.680 align:middle line:84%
the universe may
be like, then that

00:20:17.680 --> 00:20:20.560 align:middle line:84%
could possibly be
of use to others,

00:20:20.560 --> 00:20:23.930 align:middle line:90%
so it's worth communicating.

00:20:23.930 --> 00:20:28.420 align:middle line:84%
My attempt at communicating
were unintentional.

00:20:28.420 --> 00:20:30.170 align:middle line:84%
It came about
accidentally, and I

00:20:30.170 --> 00:20:33.750 align:middle line:84%
will recall some of those
anecdotes in a moment.

00:20:33.750 --> 00:20:37.160 align:middle line:84%
But I never really
intended what I've

00:20:37.160 --> 00:20:44.330 align:middle line:84%
been doing to be written down,
to be recorded, to be conveyed.

00:20:44.330 --> 00:20:47.930 align:middle line:84%
I did it for myself, because
I wanted to find out.

00:20:47.930 --> 00:20:51.240 align:middle line:84%
And I believed that by
finding out for myself,

00:20:51.240 --> 00:20:53.840 align:middle line:84%
I help others,
even without having

00:20:53.840 --> 00:20:59.030 align:middle line:84%
to put it on a piece of
paper or a tape or whatever.

00:20:59.030 --> 00:21:02.900 align:middle line:84%
So I am here now,
when I can communicate

00:21:02.900 --> 00:21:05.370 align:middle line:90%
and I wish to communicate.

00:21:05.370 --> 00:21:09.980 align:middle line:84%
And this lifetime of
experiences is possibly

00:21:09.980 --> 00:21:14.060 align:middle line:84%
the kind of experience
that will enrich

00:21:14.060 --> 00:21:16.570 align:middle line:84%
the experience of
others, and this

00:21:16.570 --> 00:21:19.710 align:middle line:84%
could have concrete
implications,

00:21:19.710 --> 00:21:22.190 align:middle line:90%
concrete consequences.

00:21:22.190 --> 00:21:27.440 align:middle line:84%
In the last count, who we are
is what our consciousness is.

00:21:27.440 --> 00:21:30.440 align:middle line:84%
We see the world through
our consciousness.

00:21:30.440 --> 00:21:34.280 align:middle line:84%
If that changes, if
that grows and evolves,

00:21:34.280 --> 00:21:37.640 align:middle line:84%
we'll act differently
and perhaps it

00:21:37.640 --> 00:21:41.930 align:middle line:84%
has this indirect but
very meaningful effect.

00:21:41.930 --> 00:21:45.860 align:middle line:84%
When you come to true
insights, you change yourself,

00:21:45.860 --> 00:21:49.250 align:middle line:84%
and by changing yourself,
you change the world.

00:21:49.250 --> 00:21:52.580 align:middle line:84%
Another presumption,
if you like, but it's

00:21:52.580 --> 00:21:56.780 align:middle line:84%
something that motivated me
to continue these explorations

00:21:56.780 --> 00:22:00.740 align:middle line:84%
and now motivates me
to try to summarize it

00:22:00.740 --> 00:22:03.530 align:middle line:84%
as part of my legacy,
a personal element

00:22:03.530 --> 00:22:08.200 align:middle line:84%
of my legacy for whoever
wishes to enter into it.

00:22:08.200 --> 00:22:13.160 align:middle line:84%
My explorations began
as a concert pianist,

00:22:13.160 --> 00:22:17.330 align:middle line:84%
not a regular, normal concert
pianist but as a child.

00:22:17.330 --> 00:22:19.555 align:middle line:84%
I remember the first
concert in Budapest.

00:22:19.555 --> 00:22:20.930 align:middle line:84%
It was the Budapest
Philharmonic.

00:22:20.930 --> 00:22:23.950 align:middle line:84%
The first public concert,
because I played many times

00:22:23.950 --> 00:22:25.760 align:middle line:90%
in private, in salons.

00:22:25.760 --> 00:22:29.390 align:middle line:84%
It was fashionable in those days
to have it in private salons,

00:22:29.390 --> 00:22:30.350 align:middle line:90%
and you invite people.

00:22:30.350 --> 00:22:33.815 align:middle line:84%
You had 20, 30, maybe
up to 50 people,

00:22:33.815 --> 00:22:37.200 align:middle line:84%
and somebody is
invited to play music.

00:22:37.200 --> 00:22:39.710 align:middle line:84%
And I did that from the
time I was seven years old,

00:22:39.710 --> 00:22:44.240 align:middle line:84%
when it was discovered that
I have some gift for music.

00:22:44.240 --> 00:22:48.980 align:middle line:84%
Indeed, it was very simple
for me to play music.

00:22:48.980 --> 00:22:51.020 align:middle line:90%
Didn't have to study it.

00:22:51.020 --> 00:22:54.680 align:middle line:84%
Even to this day, I'm very
poor at reading scores.

00:22:54.680 --> 00:22:57.770 align:middle line:84%
I hardly ever
learned from scores.

00:22:57.770 --> 00:23:00.830 align:middle line:84%
As a child, I learned by my
mother playing for me a piece,

00:23:00.830 --> 00:23:02.210 align:middle line:90%
and I would then play it again.

00:23:02.210 --> 00:23:05.510 align:middle line:84%
I would play that, pick it
up, and continue, or just

00:23:05.510 --> 00:23:06.450 align:middle line:90%
learn that.

00:23:06.450 --> 00:23:10.520 align:middle line:84%
But I never studied this from
a school, much less studied

00:23:10.520 --> 00:23:12.260 align:middle line:90%
what the composer had in mind.

00:23:12.260 --> 00:23:15.890 align:middle line:84%
I just intuitively,
I played the music.

00:23:15.890 --> 00:23:18.364 align:middle line:84%
So I played private
concerts like this,

00:23:18.364 --> 00:23:20.530 align:middle line:84%
and then when I was nine,
I played with the Budapest

00:23:20.530 --> 00:23:25.820 align:middle line:84%
Philharmonic in a concert hall,
which still exists in Budapest.

00:23:25.820 --> 00:23:28.220 align:middle line:10%
And it was a memorable
event, but you

00:23:28.220 --> 00:23:30.900 align:middle line:10%
would think that this is
a big event for a child.

00:23:30.900 --> 00:23:33.360 align:middle line:84%
But I was more
interested in the gifts

00:23:33.360 --> 00:23:36.130 align:middle line:84%
that I would get after each
of these appearances, which

00:23:36.130 --> 00:23:40.300 align:middle line:90%
are usually beautiful wreathes.

00:23:40.300 --> 00:23:42.880 align:middle line:84%
That was, in those days,
you were given a wreath.

00:23:42.880 --> 00:23:48.080 align:middle line:84%
It had a silk ribbon with all
the date of the concert on it.

00:23:48.080 --> 00:23:52.670 align:middle line:84%
And and I had a wall of my
room in my parents' apartment

00:23:52.670 --> 00:23:55.970 align:middle line:84%
covered with these
decorations on the wall.

00:23:55.970 --> 00:23:57.410 align:middle line:90%
So I was interested in that.

00:23:57.410 --> 00:23:59.340 align:middle line:84%
I was also interested
in the candies

00:23:59.340 --> 00:24:03.200 align:middle line:84%
I would be getting
after each concert.

00:24:03.200 --> 00:24:07.010 align:middle line:84%
And so the first concert that
I had at the age of nine,

00:24:07.010 --> 00:24:09.500 align:middle line:84%
I played a Mozart
piano concerto.

00:24:09.500 --> 00:24:12.800 align:middle line:84%
And when I walked on the
stage, there was, instead

00:24:12.800 --> 00:24:15.320 align:middle line:84%
of the usual applause,
there was this sort

00:24:15.320 --> 00:24:20.215 align:middle line:84%
of some astonished
people laughing and sort

00:24:20.215 --> 00:24:22.700 align:middle line:90%
of talking to each other.

00:24:22.700 --> 00:24:23.570 align:middle line:90%
Ha, ha, ha, ha.

00:24:23.570 --> 00:24:24.450 align:middle line:90%
What's that?

00:24:24.450 --> 00:24:27.470 align:middle line:84%
Because there was a child, a
nine-year-old child in shorts,

00:24:27.470 --> 00:24:30.680 align:middle line:90%
moving up on the stage.

00:24:30.680 --> 00:24:32.360 align:middle line:90%
Who was here?

00:24:32.360 --> 00:24:34.490 align:middle line:84%
It finally turns out who
he was, and I sat down

00:24:34.490 --> 00:24:36.122 align:middle line:90%
in front of the piano.

00:24:36.122 --> 00:24:38.080 align:middle line:84%
And the orchestra started
playing the concerto,

00:24:38.080 --> 00:24:40.610 align:middle line:90%
and I played.

00:24:40.610 --> 00:24:44.810 align:middle line:84%
So it was a big
experience for the public,

00:24:44.810 --> 00:24:47.050 align:middle line:84%
and it was then
remarked, many times,

00:24:47.050 --> 00:24:48.620 align:middle line:84%
and I was asked to
play the concert.

00:24:48.620 --> 00:24:52.340 align:middle line:84%
For me, the principal
experience was

00:24:52.340 --> 00:24:56.060 align:middle line:84%
seeing the lady, who was the
sponsor of many musicians.

00:24:56.060 --> 00:25:01.260 align:middle line:84%
She was a wealthy lady, who
was not there at the beginning

00:25:01.260 --> 00:25:02.060 align:middle line:90%
of the concert.

00:25:02.060 --> 00:25:03.893 align:middle line:84%
And I missed her, because
she is the one who

00:25:03.893 --> 00:25:06.410 align:middle line:84%
usually brought me all the
candies and the flowers

00:25:06.410 --> 00:25:07.900 align:middle line:90%
and everything.

00:25:07.900 --> 00:25:11.180 align:middle line:84%
And in the first movement
of this concerto,

00:25:11.180 --> 00:25:13.190 align:middle line:84%
I saw a sort of a
little commotion

00:25:13.190 --> 00:25:16.940 align:middle line:84%
there in the first row, and
there was the lady coming in.

00:25:16.940 --> 00:25:19.970 align:middle line:84%
And I was so pleased to see
her, and she was holding

00:25:19.970 --> 00:25:21.700 align:middle line:90%
a big basket in her arm.

00:25:21.700 --> 00:25:23.200 align:middle line:84%
And I was so pleased
to look at it,

00:25:23.200 --> 00:25:27.110 align:middle line:84%
that I speculated for a moment,
what could be in the basket,

00:25:27.110 --> 00:25:30.770 align:middle line:84%
and failed to come in on time,
when the piano is supposed

00:25:30.770 --> 00:25:33.160 align:middle line:90%
to come in with the orchestra.

00:25:33.160 --> 00:25:37.931 align:middle line:84%
I remember to this moment,
the conductor turning around

00:25:37.931 --> 00:25:39.430 align:middle line:84%
with astonishment
and looking at me.

00:25:39.430 --> 00:25:41.740 align:middle line:84%
There's a child,
what's he doing?

00:25:41.740 --> 00:25:44.410 align:middle line:84%
He's not coming in
when he should be.

00:25:44.410 --> 00:25:50.100 align:middle line:84%
Turning to me and lifting
the score, and this movement

00:25:50.100 --> 00:25:53.490 align:middle line:84%
on his part, of turning to
me and lifting the score,

00:25:53.490 --> 00:25:55.224 align:middle line:90%
it gave me such a fright.

00:25:55.224 --> 00:25:56.640 align:middle line:84%
It's given me such
a sensation of,

00:25:56.640 --> 00:26:00.870 align:middle line:84%
my god, what am I doing,
that I never forgot it.

00:26:00.870 --> 00:26:03.860 align:middle line:84%
I've always been extra
careful as a musician

00:26:03.860 --> 00:26:08.880 align:middle line:84%
as to know exactly what I'm
doing and to stay concentrated.

00:26:08.880 --> 00:26:12.560 align:middle line:84%
This is something that
impressed, imprinted itself

00:26:12.560 --> 00:26:13.360 align:middle line:90%
on my mind.

00:26:13.360 --> 00:26:15.210 align:middle line:84%
Well, anyway, the
concert went well.

00:26:15.210 --> 00:26:17.920 align:middle line:84%
I duly got the candy and
the wreaths afterwards.

00:26:17.920 --> 00:26:20.040 align:middle line:90%
So it all went very well.

00:26:20.040 --> 00:26:23.500 align:middle line:84%
And I kept-- then the war years
came, but after the war years

00:26:23.500 --> 00:26:25.020 align:middle line:90%
I continued to play.

00:26:25.020 --> 00:26:29.340 align:middle line:84%
And the big event was that,
when I was 15 years old,

00:26:29.340 --> 00:26:33.690 align:middle line:84%
I could be registered as a
candidate as a participant

00:26:33.690 --> 00:26:36.240 align:middle line:84%
for the International
Music Competition

00:26:36.240 --> 00:26:40.080 align:middle line:84%
in Geneva, which took place
once a year in September.

00:26:40.080 --> 00:26:42.810 align:middle line:84%
And so after the war,
it was the second time,

00:26:42.810 --> 00:26:47.240 align:middle line:84%
in September of, I think,
it's '45, I believe.

00:26:47.240 --> 00:26:49.830 align:middle line:84%
And the previous year,
I couldn't be accepted,

00:26:49.830 --> 00:26:51.200 align:middle line:90%
because I was 14 years old.

00:26:51.200 --> 00:26:52.950 align:middle line:84%
And this time I
was 15 years old.

00:26:52.950 --> 00:26:55.740 align:middle line:84%
I already had my
degree from music

00:26:55.740 --> 00:26:57.360 align:middle line:90%
from the Academy of Music.

00:26:57.360 --> 00:27:02.010 align:middle line:84%
And I was sent out
as a participant

00:27:02.010 --> 00:27:07.505 align:middle line:84%
on behalf of the State
Ministry in Hungary.

00:27:07.505 --> 00:27:10.160 align:middle line:84%
Because these were the
years, as some of the viewers

00:27:10.160 --> 00:27:13.627 align:middle line:84%
will remember, of the Cold
War, the Iron Curtain.

00:27:13.627 --> 00:27:15.960 align:middle line:84%
You couldn't move from Eastern
Europe to Western Europe,

00:27:15.960 --> 00:27:18.310 align:middle line:84%
except by very
special permission.

00:27:18.310 --> 00:27:19.850 align:middle line:90%
So I got this permission.

00:27:19.850 --> 00:27:22.710 align:middle line:84%
And because I was just
turned 15, I could go.

00:27:22.710 --> 00:27:24.990 align:middle line:84%
My mother could come
with me, being a minor.

00:27:24.990 --> 00:27:28.470 align:middle line:84%
And we went out, carrying
a small suitcase, which

00:27:28.470 --> 00:27:31.890 align:middle line:84%
is all they would let us carry,
and having a passport which is

00:27:31.890 --> 00:27:35.100 align:middle line:90%
valid for all of three weeks.

00:27:35.100 --> 00:27:37.240 align:middle line:90%
We were expected to return.

00:27:37.240 --> 00:27:39.720 align:middle line:84%
And then when I got one
of the grand prizes there,

00:27:39.720 --> 00:27:43.620 align:middle line:84%
jointly with a Spanish
pianist, then I didn't return.

00:27:43.620 --> 00:27:45.690 align:middle line:90%
We got offers to go out.

00:27:45.690 --> 00:27:49.110 align:middle line:84%
And carrying the small suitcase,
went on to Paris and then

00:27:49.110 --> 00:27:54.950 align:middle line:84%
to other cities and managed
to get an international visa--

00:27:54.950 --> 00:27:59.580 align:middle line:84%
an international passport, which
is limited in its validity,

00:27:59.580 --> 00:28:02.100 align:middle line:90%
but it served for a time being.

00:28:02.100 --> 00:28:04.800 align:middle line:84%
And so I never returned
to our native Hungary

00:28:04.800 --> 00:28:07.080 align:middle line:90%
to live after that.

00:28:07.080 --> 00:28:11.070 align:middle line:84%
Interestingly enough, that
international passport

00:28:11.070 --> 00:28:15.420 align:middle line:84%
was then supplemented
or substituted

00:28:15.420 --> 00:28:21.450 align:middle line:84%
by the resident permit in the
US, not by a normal means.

00:28:21.450 --> 00:28:25.080 align:middle line:84%
Because the normal means would
have been a quota from Hungary,

00:28:25.080 --> 00:28:27.197 align:middle line:84%
which would take six
years to run through,

00:28:27.197 --> 00:28:29.280 align:middle line:84%
because there were a very
limited number of people

00:28:29.280 --> 00:28:30.830 align:middle line:90%
who were accepted.

00:28:30.830 --> 00:28:36.930 align:middle line:84%
But a special permission,
which was done through,

00:28:36.930 --> 00:28:39.750 align:middle line:84%
what's known as a private
bill by a Senator,

00:28:39.750 --> 00:28:42.690 align:middle line:84%
Senator of the US,
Senator Pepper,

00:28:42.690 --> 00:28:45.210 align:middle line:84%
who heard my concert in
Washington in the Constitution

00:28:45.210 --> 00:28:46.260 align:middle line:90%
Hall.

00:28:46.260 --> 00:28:48.780 align:middle line:84%
And he asked if there is
anything he can do for me.

00:28:48.780 --> 00:28:51.650 align:middle line:84%
I said, certainly, Senator,
something you can do for me,

00:28:51.650 --> 00:28:54.000 align:middle line:90%
stop me from being deported.

00:28:54.000 --> 00:28:58.710 align:middle line:84%
Because my visa for the US on
this international passport

00:28:58.710 --> 00:29:02.470 align:middle line:84%
would expire the following week,
and I would have to return.

00:29:02.470 --> 00:29:04.460 align:middle line:90%
And I would like to stay.

00:29:04.460 --> 00:29:06.630 align:middle line:10%
And Senator Pepper
said, come see me

00:29:06.630 --> 00:29:10.530 align:middle line:10%
in my office tomorrow
in the Capitol building.

00:29:10.530 --> 00:29:12.770 align:middle line:90%
I did, and he said, don't worry.

00:29:12.770 --> 00:29:14.970 align:middle line:84%
I'll introduce a private
bill in the Congress

00:29:14.970 --> 00:29:17.580 align:middle line:90%
to nominate you for citizenship.

00:29:17.580 --> 00:29:19.530 align:middle line:84%
And even though that
will take maybe up

00:29:19.530 --> 00:29:22.124 align:middle line:84%
to a year to run through,
but in the meanwhile,

00:29:22.124 --> 00:29:23.040 align:middle line:90%
you can't be deported.

00:29:23.040 --> 00:29:24.005 align:middle line:90%
You can stay.

00:29:24.005 --> 00:29:25.950 align:middle line:90%
And I said fine.

00:29:25.950 --> 00:29:27.660 align:middle line:10%
And so he signed the papers.

00:29:27.660 --> 00:29:30.430 align:middle line:84%
And not about six or
eight months later,

00:29:30.430 --> 00:29:34.940 align:middle line:84%
I got my US citizenship based
on the private bill in Congress.

00:29:34.940 --> 00:29:37.710 align:middle line:90%


00:29:37.710 --> 00:29:43.470 align:middle line:84%
The next step in this
adventurous developments

00:29:43.470 --> 00:29:51.680 align:middle line:84%
from concert pianist was an
event, a New Year's event,

00:29:51.680 --> 00:29:53.790 align:middle line:90%
which was not a musical event.

00:29:53.790 --> 00:29:58.970 align:middle line:84%
But it was the first New Year
after my first son was born.

00:29:58.970 --> 00:30:02.880 align:middle line:84%
And with my wife, we went
out to the Austrian Alps

00:30:02.880 --> 00:30:04.950 align:middle line:90%
for that weekend.

00:30:04.950 --> 00:30:06.960 align:middle line:90%
And we skated.

00:30:06.960 --> 00:30:10.590 align:middle line:84%
We looked at these
beautiful outbound regions.

00:30:10.590 --> 00:30:13.350 align:middle line:84%
And at night, that night,
before going to sleep,

00:30:13.350 --> 00:30:17.350 align:middle line:84%
I looked out on the
balcony of my hotel

00:30:17.350 --> 00:30:21.530 align:middle line:84%
in Garmisch, which was
the name of the town.

00:30:21.530 --> 00:30:26.040 align:middle line:84%
And there I saw the villages,
like pearls lying in the snow

00:30:26.040 --> 00:30:29.190 align:middle line:84%
all around us and the
peaks of the mountains.

00:30:29.190 --> 00:30:31.620 align:middle line:84%
And I said, those
thoughts that I've

00:30:31.620 --> 00:30:36.180 align:middle line:84%
had ever since as a child about
what meaning there is to life

00:30:36.180 --> 00:30:39.690 align:middle line:84%
and there is more to
it than what you see,

00:30:39.690 --> 00:30:42.780 align:middle line:84%
I should look at
those more seriously.

00:30:42.780 --> 00:30:46.370 align:middle line:84%
And then, at that
moment, I had the resolve

00:30:46.370 --> 00:30:49.020 align:middle line:84%
that, together with my
life as a concert pianist,

00:30:49.020 --> 00:30:52.570 align:middle line:84%
I would also start reading,
start attending courses.

00:30:52.570 --> 00:30:54.790 align:middle line:84%
I ascribed in various
courses in New York,

00:30:54.790 --> 00:30:58.410 align:middle line:84%
for example, at Columbia at the
famous New School for Social

00:30:58.410 --> 00:31:01.050 align:middle line:84%
Research, in Munich
in the University

00:31:01.050 --> 00:31:03.000 align:middle line:90%
there, wherever I was.

00:31:03.000 --> 00:31:05.430 align:middle line:84%
And I followed these
courses without actually

00:31:05.430 --> 00:31:08.530 align:middle line:84%
taking degrees, because I
already had a music degree.

00:31:08.530 --> 00:31:11.620 align:middle line:84%
And as a concert pianist, I
didn't need any other degree.

00:31:11.620 --> 00:31:14.910 align:middle line:84%
But there I was, basically
following the courses,

00:31:14.910 --> 00:31:20.320 align:middle line:84%
making notes, reading, taking
notes, and writing, as well.

00:31:20.320 --> 00:31:25.750 align:middle line:84%
So this resolve
resulted in my becoming

00:31:25.750 --> 00:31:30.600 align:middle line:84%
serious about exploring these
things that I talked about.

00:31:30.600 --> 00:31:35.490 align:middle line:84%
The next major step came when
these explorations gave rise

00:31:35.490 --> 00:31:39.130 align:middle line:84%
to a first step in a
professional career,

00:31:39.130 --> 00:31:40.740 align:middle line:90%
the change of career.

00:31:40.740 --> 00:31:44.340 align:middle line:84%
Unexpected, totally,
but perhaps not

00:31:44.340 --> 00:31:49.990 align:middle line:84%
entirely meaningless
or accidental.

00:31:49.990 --> 00:31:53.010 align:middle line:84%
I had a concert in
the Hague, in Holland.

00:31:53.010 --> 00:31:55.680 align:middle line:84%
And I was feeling
very well, because I

00:31:55.680 --> 00:31:57.640 align:middle line:90%
thought the concerts went well.

00:31:57.640 --> 00:32:01.050 align:middle line:84%
And after the concert,
there was a usual dinner

00:32:01.050 --> 00:32:04.050 align:middle line:90%
served near the concert hall.

00:32:04.050 --> 00:32:08.106 align:middle line:84%
And this hall was also near
the hotel that I stayed.

00:32:08.106 --> 00:32:10.820 align:middle line:84%
And in this dinner, some
special guests were invited

00:32:10.820 --> 00:32:13.410 align:middle line:84%
and one of them
started talking to me,

00:32:13.410 --> 00:32:16.590 align:middle line:84%
and asking me whether
I ever thought

00:32:16.590 --> 00:32:18.600 align:middle line:90%
why I'm doing what I'm doing?

00:32:18.600 --> 00:32:19.890 align:middle line:90%
What good is it?

00:32:19.890 --> 00:32:22.320 align:middle line:90%
And this sort of challenged me.

00:32:22.320 --> 00:32:27.210 align:middle line:84%
What am I really doing, playing
concerts, spending my life

00:32:27.210 --> 00:32:29.910 align:middle line:90%
playing in the public?

00:32:29.910 --> 00:32:32.560 align:middle line:84%
And I said, yes indeed, I have
thought about these things.

00:32:32.560 --> 00:32:34.850 align:middle line:84%
And he said, did you
ever write anything down.

00:32:34.850 --> 00:32:35.720 align:middle line:90%
I said, sure.

00:32:35.720 --> 00:32:38.120 align:middle line:84%
I was carrying-- my
notebook is with me always.

00:32:38.120 --> 00:32:41.910 align:middle line:84%
It had become quite a
thick book, and I have it.

00:32:41.910 --> 00:32:43.030 align:middle line:90%
I have it with me.

00:32:43.030 --> 00:32:44.320 align:middle line:90%
And he said, can I read it?

00:32:44.320 --> 00:32:45.120 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:32:45.120 --> 00:32:45.920 align:middle line:90%
I was feeling good.

00:32:45.920 --> 00:32:47.470 align:middle line:90%
It was after the concert.

00:32:47.470 --> 00:32:49.000 align:middle line:90%
I thought it went well.

00:32:49.000 --> 00:32:50.190 align:middle line:90%
So I went over to my room.

00:32:50.190 --> 00:32:52.740 align:middle line:90%
I got him a pile of notes.

00:32:52.740 --> 00:32:55.050 align:middle line:84%
And I said, here, I don't
know what to do with it.

00:32:55.050 --> 00:32:57.660 align:middle line:84%
I keep writing every day
on it, but this is just

00:32:57.660 --> 00:32:59.520 align:middle line:90%
what occurs to me.

00:32:59.520 --> 00:33:00.469 align:middle line:90%
And he said thank you.

00:33:00.469 --> 00:33:02.760 align:middle line:84%
And then he talked to others,
and then I looked around,

00:33:02.760 --> 00:33:04.452 align:middle line:90%
and he wasn't there anymore.

00:33:04.452 --> 00:33:06.660 align:middle line:84%
These were handwritten notes,
and I was a bit worried

00:33:06.660 --> 00:33:07.493 align:middle line:90%
about what happened.

00:33:07.493 --> 00:33:09.450 align:middle line:90%
I didn't have any copies.

00:33:09.450 --> 00:33:12.340 align:middle line:84%
But he showed up next
morning, and he said,

00:33:12.340 --> 00:33:14.090 align:middle line:90%
we will publish it.

00:33:14.090 --> 00:33:15.930 align:middle line:90%
And I said, who are you?

00:33:15.930 --> 00:33:18.270 align:middle line:84%
I said, well, the gentleman
who I met last night

00:33:18.270 --> 00:33:21.240 align:middle line:84%
turned out to be the editor
of a prestigious publishing

00:33:21.240 --> 00:33:25.770 align:middle line:84%
house, Martinus Nijhoff
of the Hague in Holland.

00:33:25.770 --> 00:33:27.360 align:middle line:90%
And he indeed did publish it.

00:33:27.360 --> 00:33:29.070 align:middle line:84%
It wasn't as simple
as that, because it

00:33:29.070 --> 00:33:32.430 align:middle line:84%
took a year to put the notes
into order and the chapters,

00:33:32.430 --> 00:33:33.990 align:middle line:90%
make references and so on.

00:33:33.990 --> 00:33:36.780 align:middle line:84%
He helped me with
the formalities.

00:33:36.780 --> 00:33:40.980 align:middle line:84%
But this is how my book got
published, the first book.

00:33:40.980 --> 00:33:43.710 align:middle line:84%
And this is the first
time it occurred to me

00:33:43.710 --> 00:33:47.160 align:middle line:84%
that what I'm doing for myself
could be of interest to anybody

00:33:47.160 --> 00:33:48.240 align:middle line:90%
else.

00:33:48.240 --> 00:33:51.060 align:middle line:84%
Up till then, I didn't
even show it to others,

00:33:51.060 --> 00:33:54.540 align:middle line:84%
because my sense was that
people don't take seriously

00:33:54.540 --> 00:33:57.930 align:middle line:84%
what a concert artist is doing
when he starts philosophizing.

00:33:57.930 --> 00:34:00.540 align:middle line:84%
Leave that to philosophers
or to scientists.

00:34:00.540 --> 00:34:02.430 align:middle line:90%
Just play the music.

00:34:02.430 --> 00:34:06.750 align:middle line:84%
But somehow, I was very
protectionist about it,

00:34:06.750 --> 00:34:09.510 align:middle line:90%
protective about it.

00:34:09.510 --> 00:34:12.409 align:middle line:90%
But here, the book appeared.

00:34:12.409 --> 00:34:14.570 align:middle line:90%
It was in 1963 that it appeared.

00:34:14.570 --> 00:34:17.008 align:middle line:90%
This incidence was in '61.

00:34:17.008 --> 00:34:19.159 align:middle line:90%
In 1963, it was my first book.

00:34:19.159 --> 00:34:22.460 align:middle line:90%
I was 31 years old at the time.

00:34:22.460 --> 00:34:26.449 align:middle line:84%
And that changed my whole
career, my whole life,

00:34:26.449 --> 00:34:30.449 align:middle line:84%
because this book came to the
attention of various people,

00:34:30.449 --> 00:34:33.739 align:middle line:84%
including the head of the
Department of Philosophy

00:34:33.739 --> 00:34:36.320 align:middle line:84%
at Yale University,
who at one point

00:34:36.320 --> 00:34:39.139 align:middle line:84%
just simply invited me,
and said come over and give

00:34:39.139 --> 00:34:43.389 align:middle line:84%
a series of seminars on
the ideas of your book.

00:34:43.389 --> 00:34:46.080 align:middle line:84%
Because your idea is
very close to Whitehead

00:34:46.080 --> 00:34:49.260 align:middle line:84%
and to [INAUDIBLE],,
Umberto, and others.

00:34:49.260 --> 00:34:53.179 align:middle line:84%
[INAUDIBLE] came later,
but Umberto [INAUDIBLE]..

00:34:53.179 --> 00:34:56.100 align:middle line:90%
So I didn't know what to do.

00:34:56.100 --> 00:34:58.850 align:middle line:90%
I was on the horns of a dilemma.

00:34:58.850 --> 00:35:01.960 align:middle line:84%
Because you can't
do serious seminars

00:35:01.960 --> 00:35:06.050 align:middle line:84%
at Yale and at the same live
the life of a concert artist.

00:35:06.050 --> 00:35:09.500 align:middle line:84%
You have to choose, at
least for the time being.

00:35:09.500 --> 00:35:12.020 align:middle line:84%
And I was undecided
until it was also

00:35:12.020 --> 00:35:16.820 align:middle line:84%
decided for me by any incident,
which happened in Bonn.

00:35:16.820 --> 00:35:20.410 align:middle line:10%
Now, Bonn is the birthplace
of Ludwig van Beethoven, who

00:35:20.410 --> 00:35:21.785 align:middle line:10%
lived most of his
life in Vienna,

00:35:21.785 --> 00:35:25.220 align:middle line:10%
but he was born in
Bonn, near Cologne.

00:35:25.220 --> 00:35:29.660 align:middle line:10%
And this town, to this day,
remains a kind of a shrine

00:35:29.660 --> 00:35:31.940 align:middle line:10%
to the genius of the Beethoven.

00:35:31.940 --> 00:35:33.920 align:middle line:10%
And I was very
honored by having been

00:35:33.920 --> 00:35:39.710 align:middle line:10%
asked to give a recital of
Beethoven sonatas in Bonn.

00:35:39.710 --> 00:35:42.980 align:middle line:84%
I was settling
into this concept,

00:35:42.980 --> 00:35:45.650 align:middle line:84%
and I remember forgetting
to get off the train,

00:35:45.650 --> 00:35:48.770 align:middle line:84%
because I was so busy
thinking about my thoughts,

00:35:48.770 --> 00:35:50.420 align:middle line:90%
that I had to finally jump off.

00:35:50.420 --> 00:35:53.000 align:middle line:84%
Because we already
arrived, and I

00:35:53.000 --> 00:35:56.450 align:middle line:84%
was deep in thinking about
the ideas of evolution

00:35:56.450 --> 00:36:01.100 align:middle line:84%
and universal interdependence
and all these things.

00:36:01.100 --> 00:36:03.799 align:middle line:84%
And during the concept,
I kept thinking about it.

00:36:03.799 --> 00:36:05.840 align:middle line:84%
In fact, it was very
difficult to remove my mind.

00:36:05.840 --> 00:36:08.300 align:middle line:84%
So while I was
playing, as it happens,

00:36:08.300 --> 00:36:13.465 align:middle line:84%
it's Sonata Opus 53, which is
known as the Waldstein Sonata.

00:36:13.465 --> 00:36:16.470 align:middle line:10%
While I was playing it, I was
thinking about these ideas,

00:36:16.470 --> 00:36:18.590 align:middle line:10%
and I forgot where I was.

00:36:18.590 --> 00:36:20.510 align:middle line:84%
And in the middle of
the second movement,

00:36:20.510 --> 00:36:23.290 align:middle line:84%
which has the usual structure,
where you play the first, then

00:36:23.290 --> 00:36:24.090 align:middle line:90%
the second.

00:36:24.090 --> 00:36:25.720 align:middle line:84%
Then you need to go
back to the first part

00:36:25.720 --> 00:36:27.050 align:middle line:90%
and go back to the second part.

00:36:27.050 --> 00:36:30.380 align:middle line:84%
You continue in a
different way to the end.

00:36:30.380 --> 00:36:33.170 align:middle line:84%
So in the middle of that part,
I was playing the main theme.

00:36:33.170 --> 00:36:36.050 align:middle line:84%
I realized that here I'm
sitting in a concert hall,

00:36:36.050 --> 00:36:38.227 align:middle line:84%
playing the second
movement of the sonata,

00:36:38.227 --> 00:36:40.310 align:middle line:84%
and I don't know if I
played it for the first time

00:36:40.310 --> 00:36:43.400 align:middle line:84%
or for the second time,
because it comes back again.

00:36:43.400 --> 00:36:45.500 align:middle line:10%
You see, if I make
the wrong decision,

00:36:45.500 --> 00:36:51.170 align:middle line:10%
I either skip the entire rest
of the movement, or I repeat it.

00:36:51.170 --> 00:36:55.800 align:middle line:84%
Either one, would be very
unpleasant, unprecedented.

00:36:55.800 --> 00:36:56.780 align:middle line:90%
So I said--

00:36:56.780 --> 00:36:58.400 align:middle line:84%
I had to jump and
make a decision.

00:36:58.400 --> 00:37:00.020 align:middle line:90%
I decided I already played it.

00:37:00.020 --> 00:37:03.040 align:middle line:84%
I go on to the third movement
and nobody said anything.

00:37:03.040 --> 00:37:05.150 align:middle line:84%
It must have been
the right decision.

00:37:05.150 --> 00:37:08.250 align:middle line:84%
But then I said, if this turns
out to be the right decision,

00:37:08.250 --> 00:37:11.540 align:middle line:84%
I am going to accept
the offer from Yale.

00:37:11.540 --> 00:37:13.750 align:middle line:84%
The next morning, I
went to the post office.

00:37:13.750 --> 00:37:17.900 align:middle line:84%
I sent a telegram to the head
of the department of philosophy,

00:37:17.900 --> 00:37:21.890 align:middle line:84%
Professor Shrader and
I said, I'm coming.

00:37:21.890 --> 00:37:25.950 align:middle line:84%
And that meant that I had to
give up the life of a concert

00:37:25.950 --> 00:37:28.580 align:middle line:90%
artist and become an academic.

00:37:28.580 --> 00:37:30.770 align:middle line:84%
From Yale, I went
on to other places.

00:37:30.770 --> 00:37:35.210 align:middle line:84%
I met another guest
professor at Yale

00:37:35.210 --> 00:37:40.340 align:middle line:84%
who was from the University
in Paris, Sorbonne,

00:37:40.340 --> 00:37:42.980 align:middle line:84%
and he said, I read
your book, and I

00:37:42.980 --> 00:37:49.406 align:middle line:84%
would like you to present
these ideas at the Sorbonne.

00:37:49.406 --> 00:37:51.310 align:middle line:90%
And how could we do this?

00:37:51.310 --> 00:37:53.820 align:middle line:84%
And I said, very simple,
if you invite me to present

00:37:53.820 --> 00:37:55.310 align:middle line:90%
a thesis for a doctorate.

00:37:55.310 --> 00:37:56.910 align:middle line:90%
He said, of course.

00:37:56.910 --> 00:38:00.610 align:middle line:84%
And so I presented a
thesis, a doctoral thesis

00:38:00.610 --> 00:38:03.460 align:middle line:84%
at the Sorbonne, for which
I got a doctoral degree

00:38:03.460 --> 00:38:05.850 align:middle line:84%
at the Sorbonne,
without ever having

00:38:05.850 --> 00:38:09.200 align:middle line:84%
attended a university
in my life,

00:38:09.200 --> 00:38:14.070 align:middle line:84%
except in this very informal
way of sitting in, in classes.

00:38:14.070 --> 00:38:19.580 align:middle line:84%
And I've got jobs of teaching in
various universities in the US,

00:38:19.580 --> 00:38:20.974 align:middle line:90%
then in other places, as well.

00:38:20.974 --> 00:38:23.140 align:middle line:84%
But in the US, on the west
coast in the Middle East,

00:38:23.140 --> 00:38:24.830 align:middle line:90%
and the east.

00:38:24.830 --> 00:38:26.300 align:middle line:84%
And I was in the
curious position

00:38:26.300 --> 00:38:33.170 align:middle line:84%
of teaching students, who are
already well into the subject

00:38:33.170 --> 00:38:34.250 align:middle line:90%
matter of philosophy.

00:38:34.250 --> 00:38:36.040 align:middle line:84%
And I have never
learned any of that.

00:38:36.040 --> 00:38:39.530 align:middle line:84%
I was just working on my
own, exploring my own.

00:38:39.530 --> 00:38:41.240 align:middle line:90%
So I didn't even know--

00:38:41.240 --> 00:38:43.220 align:middle line:84%
one of the biggest
problems I had,

00:38:43.220 --> 00:38:45.290 align:middle line:84%
I didn't know how
to give an exam.

00:38:45.290 --> 00:38:48.590 align:middle line:84%
I never took an exam in
a university, you know?

00:38:48.590 --> 00:38:52.790 align:middle line:84%
All through these years
of teaching and acting

00:38:52.790 --> 00:38:57.890 align:middle line:84%
as an academic, my music
was in the background

00:38:57.890 --> 00:39:01.560 align:middle line:84%
but it created both
inspiration and framework.

00:39:01.560 --> 00:39:07.790 align:middle line:84%
It was a framework for
seeking something in science,

00:39:07.790 --> 00:39:11.060 align:middle line:84%
seeking wholeness, seeking
completion, seeking

00:39:11.060 --> 00:39:13.130 align:middle line:90%
meaning, not just the part.

00:39:13.130 --> 00:39:17.370 align:middle line:84%
I would never look at just one
thing as one thing in itself.

00:39:17.370 --> 00:39:21.020 align:middle line:84%
I would always look, how
is it related to the rest?

00:39:21.020 --> 00:39:23.602 align:middle line:84%
In music, a single tone
doesn't make any sense,

00:39:23.602 --> 00:39:24.560 align:middle line:90%
doesn't have a meaning.

00:39:24.560 --> 00:39:26.960 align:middle line:84%
Only the relationship
has a meaning.

00:39:26.960 --> 00:39:28.280 align:middle line:90%
So I was always looking.

00:39:28.280 --> 00:39:30.980 align:middle line:84%
A single statement in
philosophy or science

00:39:30.980 --> 00:39:33.280 align:middle line:84%
doesn't have a
meaning in itself.

00:39:33.280 --> 00:39:36.170 align:middle line:84%
What is the whole thing
that it conveys, meaning?

00:39:36.170 --> 00:39:38.750 align:middle line:84%
What is the whole thing
that we want to know?

00:39:38.750 --> 00:39:40.480 align:middle line:90%
What kind of a world is this?

00:39:40.480 --> 00:39:42.140 align:middle line:90%
Always the big questions.

00:39:42.140 --> 00:39:45.230 align:middle line:84%
So I never stopped
with a given question.

00:39:45.230 --> 00:39:48.290 align:middle line:84%
I always asked, how is
this possible in the world

00:39:48.290 --> 00:39:49.210 align:middle line:90%
in which we live?

00:39:49.210 --> 00:39:51.650 align:middle line:84%
Is the experience that
we have of this world?

00:39:51.650 --> 00:39:54.320 align:middle line:84%
That's why I always
pursued the big questions,

00:39:54.320 --> 00:39:57.480 align:middle line:84%
and I didn't really care
what, in the profession,

00:39:57.480 --> 00:40:00.090 align:middle line:90%
my colleagues would say to them.

00:40:00.090 --> 00:40:01.640 align:middle line:90%
I just went ahead.

00:40:01.640 --> 00:40:07.790 align:middle line:84%
Music is an experience
of meaning and wholeness,

00:40:07.790 --> 00:40:09.640 align:middle line:90%
and that's a mystical quest.

00:40:09.640 --> 00:40:13.040 align:middle line:84%
That is the quest, I
think, basically to also

00:40:13.040 --> 00:40:15.200 align:middle line:84%
to all great
thinkers, whether they

00:40:15.200 --> 00:40:18.920 align:middle line:84%
call themselves scientists
or theologians or mystics

00:40:18.920 --> 00:40:20.400 align:middle line:90%
or whatever.

00:40:20.400 --> 00:40:26.390 align:middle line:10%
The ideas that I could
pursue, insisted on pursuing,

00:40:26.390 --> 00:40:31.040 align:middle line:10%
led me to some concepts,
some insights that

00:40:31.040 --> 00:40:34.910 align:middle line:10%
have practical consequences,
practical in the sense

00:40:34.910 --> 00:40:37.220 align:middle line:10%
that you could
apply to your life.

00:40:37.220 --> 00:40:40.390 align:middle line:84%
Systems theory was
new at the time,

00:40:40.390 --> 00:40:44.030 align:middle line:84%
when I started working with
it in the '60s and '70s.

00:40:44.030 --> 00:40:45.790 align:middle line:90%
Now, it's very widespread.

00:40:45.790 --> 00:40:47.960 align:middle line:84%
But systems theory says
that one thing is always

00:40:47.960 --> 00:40:51.620 align:middle line:84%
connected so that
together they create

00:40:51.620 --> 00:40:53.930 align:middle line:90%
an action, a development.

00:40:53.930 --> 00:40:57.820 align:middle line:84%
And I would say to young people,
don't look only at the part,

00:40:57.820 --> 00:41:01.290 align:middle line:84%
at the single element, look
at how it hangs together.

00:41:01.290 --> 00:41:02.870 align:middle line:90%
What does it finally do?

00:41:02.870 --> 00:41:04.650 align:middle line:90%
What does it do to you?

00:41:04.650 --> 00:41:06.560 align:middle line:90%
What does it do to your world?

00:41:06.560 --> 00:41:09.890 align:middle line:84%
Think systemically, which
today, in a less forbidding way,

00:41:09.890 --> 00:41:12.710 align:middle line:84%
perhaps you can say,
think holistically.

00:41:12.710 --> 00:41:16.330 align:middle line:84%
And this is mysticism in one
way, but it's not science.

00:41:16.330 --> 00:41:20.240 align:middle line:84%
In between, came quantum
science, quantum theory, which

00:41:20.240 --> 00:41:23.480 align:middle line:84%
shows that each thing in a
system, in a quantum system

00:41:23.480 --> 00:41:26.720 align:middle line:84%
is so related to the
others, that simultaneously,

00:41:26.720 --> 00:41:29.190 align:middle line:84%
nonlocally, all
things occur together.

00:41:29.190 --> 00:41:32.900 align:middle line:84%
So I would say to young
people, look at the context

00:41:32.900 --> 00:41:37.490 align:middle line:84%
and try to understand how
your situation, your existence

00:41:37.490 --> 00:41:40.340 align:middle line:84%
in this world can
relate to that.

00:41:40.340 --> 00:41:44.060 align:middle line:84%
So that that context becomes
more whole, more true.

00:41:44.060 --> 00:41:47.060 align:middle line:84%
We talked about it before,
and we will talk again

00:41:47.060 --> 00:41:51.050 align:middle line:84%
about the fact that what
there is in the world

00:41:51.050 --> 00:41:56.510 align:middle line:84%
is a series of co-evolutions,
series of things

00:41:56.510 --> 00:41:58.460 align:middle line:90%
that are evolving together.

00:41:58.460 --> 00:42:04.070 align:middle line:84%
And only when that
co-evolution is moving forward

00:42:04.070 --> 00:42:08.180 align:middle line:84%
is your participation
in it meaningful.

00:42:08.180 --> 00:42:11.260 align:middle line:84%
Only then, you contribute
to that co-evolution.

00:42:11.260 --> 00:42:13.820 align:middle line:84%
Because the world does not
run by looking at the whole.

00:42:13.820 --> 00:42:18.680 align:middle line:84%
The world looks at only what
happens now, in a momentary way

00:42:18.680 --> 00:42:22.690 align:middle line:84%
and only in one part
and disregards this.

00:42:22.690 --> 00:42:26.240 align:middle line:84%
So bringing this back,
it's not only idealistic,

00:42:26.240 --> 00:42:28.370 align:middle line:90%
it's very, very practical.

00:42:28.370 --> 00:42:30.980 align:middle line:84%
Because unless you look
at the whole thing, how

00:42:30.980 --> 00:42:34.130 align:middle line:84%
it develops, how it hangs
together, how what you do

00:42:34.130 --> 00:42:35.730 align:middle line:90%
belongs to that.

00:42:35.730 --> 00:42:38.570 align:middle line:84%
Otherwise, you can go
off on the wrong tangent,

00:42:38.570 --> 00:42:42.320 align:middle line:84%
and you won't find out until
you notice that really it

00:42:42.320 --> 00:42:44.360 align:middle line:90%
doesn't lead to anywhere.

00:42:44.360 --> 00:42:47.630 align:middle line:84%
What leads someplace
is this total system

00:42:47.630 --> 00:42:50.780 align:middle line:84%
that evolves with
you as a part of it.

00:42:50.780 --> 00:42:53.530 align:middle line:90%
