00:00:27.870 --> 00:00:32.310 align:middle line:10%
>> The whole universe consists
of vibration, we can say,

00:00:32.310 --> 00:00:35.290 align:middle line:10%
different clusters, different
patterns of vibration.

00:00:35.290 --> 00:00:38.680 align:middle line:84%
The galaxies have their
own vibration pattern.

00:00:38.680 --> 00:00:41.840 align:middle line:84%
An amoeba has its own
vibration pattern.

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:43.410 align:middle line:90%
A mouse has.

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:47.160 align:middle line:84%
And so do we, individually
and collectively.

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:50.730 align:middle line:84%
So there's this great
insight that is coming.

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:54.270 align:middle line:84%
We individually are a
pattern of vibration

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:57.780 align:middle line:84%
in this Akashic field
in the total pattern

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:00.780 align:middle line:90%
of the universal vibration.

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:08.360 align:middle line:84%
And this particular pattern
is there to give us viability.

00:01:08.360 --> 00:01:11.880 align:middle line:84%
We would not be
here, we could not

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:16.780 align:middle line:84%
have been here unless we
were attuned to this pattern.

00:01:16.780 --> 00:01:20.280 align:middle line:84%
And when I am in
touch with that,

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:23.910 align:middle line:84%
when I am one with that
vibrational aspect which

00:01:23.910 --> 00:01:28.110 align:middle line:84%
is there in the universe,
then I'm healthy.

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:32.760 align:middle line:84%
So this gives us a new
concept of health and disease.

00:01:32.760 --> 00:01:35.400 align:middle line:84%
It's not so new that it
will be unprecedented,

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:40.590 align:middle line:84%
because the ancient wisdom
traditions talked about this.

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:44.440 align:middle line:10%
But being aligned to something
that is there in the universe,

00:01:44.440 --> 00:01:47.530 align:middle line:10%
that is produced in the
universe independently

00:01:47.530 --> 00:01:52.210 align:middle line:10%
of us, which is already there,
that is the great challenge.

00:01:52.210 --> 00:01:57.560 align:middle line:10%
Define then health, being
healthy, being attuned,

00:01:57.560 --> 00:02:03.720 align:middle line:10%
aligned with, governed by,
being one with all of these,

00:02:03.720 --> 00:02:08.870 align:middle line:10%
with that vibration, pattern
of vibration in the universe.

00:02:08.870 --> 00:02:13.390 align:middle line:84%
This is information medicine,
very different from the concept

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:17.020 align:middle line:84%
of classical medicine,
not the old classical,

00:02:17.020 --> 00:02:19.840 align:middle line:90%
but the new, modern medicine.

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:22.360 align:middle line:84%
Very different from what
is being practiced now,

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:25.280 align:middle line:90%
which is biochemical medicine.

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:27.890 align:middle line:84%
We would say that the
biochemistry of the body

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:31.010 align:middle line:84%
is something that
expresses this pattern.

00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:35.430 align:middle line:84%
When we are well-aligned, then
the biochemistry works, then

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:37.960 align:middle line:90%
the organs work, the cells work.

00:02:37.960 --> 00:02:40.180 align:middle line:90%
They're all functional.

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:43.030 align:middle line:84%
When we are not
well-aligned, then there

00:02:43.030 --> 00:02:46.090 align:middle line:90%
is a flaw in this information.

00:02:46.090 --> 00:02:49.450 align:middle line:84%
And it's expressed in
a poor biochemistry,

00:02:49.450 --> 00:02:52.200 align:middle line:84%
in a poor relationship of
the cells to each other

00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:54.380 align:middle line:90%
through the organs.

00:02:54.380 --> 00:02:58.100 align:middle line:84%
Even the cell has a
program, now we recognize.

00:02:58.100 --> 00:03:01.940 align:middle line:84%
And in fact, the new medicine
is programming medicine,

00:03:01.940 --> 00:03:04.800 align:middle line:90%
is information programming.

00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:07.960 align:middle line:84%
That is the cure for many,
many diseases, perhaps

00:03:07.960 --> 00:03:14.940 align:middle line:84%
all, Because when we are
one with this pattern,

00:03:14.940 --> 00:03:18.640 align:middle line:84%
then all the
information is flowing.

00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:22.870 align:middle line:84%
And when we are not, then
some blockages appear.

00:03:22.870 --> 00:03:26.400 align:middle line:84%
Now, it's interesting that you
can talk about local blockages.

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:28.652 align:middle line:90%
Something is wrong locally.

00:03:28.652 --> 00:03:29.960 align:middle line:90%
But you don't realize--

00:03:29.960 --> 00:03:31.670 align:middle line:84%
I think we mentioned
this already--

00:03:31.670 --> 00:03:35.060 align:middle line:84%
that that local is
part of the whole.

00:03:35.060 --> 00:03:40.910 align:middle line:84%
You can't break open the human
system or any living system,

00:03:40.910 --> 00:03:43.010 align:middle line:90%
probably any complex system.

00:03:43.010 --> 00:03:46.430 align:middle line:84%
You can't make just
one part whole.

00:03:46.430 --> 00:03:47.710 align:middle line:90%
You have to do the whole.

00:03:47.710 --> 00:03:51.580 align:middle line:84%
Whatever you do interacts
with the whole system.

00:03:51.580 --> 00:03:56.590 align:middle line:84%
So a very different concept
from standard medical practice,

00:03:56.590 --> 00:03:58.910 align:middle line:90%
which takes one thing at a time.

00:03:58.910 --> 00:04:01.340 align:middle line:84%
The problem is, let's
say, your liver.

00:04:01.340 --> 00:04:03.450 align:middle line:84%
And then you work
on your liver, never

00:04:03.450 --> 00:04:06.620 align:middle line:90%
mind the lungs or the heart.

00:04:06.620 --> 00:04:09.940 align:middle line:84%
Here, every part-- the new
realization, every part

00:04:09.940 --> 00:04:13.670 align:middle line:84%
is interacting with
every other part

00:04:13.670 --> 00:04:18.920 align:middle line:84%
so that we are a
non-decomposable whole system.

00:04:18.920 --> 00:04:24.250 align:middle line:84%
That is the standard
good expert expression.

00:04:24.250 --> 00:04:27.230 align:middle line:84%
Decomposability means
that you can take apart

00:04:27.230 --> 00:04:30.425 align:middle line:84%
the system and work
on the part and then

00:04:30.425 --> 00:04:32.630 align:middle line:90%
you put it together again.

00:04:32.630 --> 00:04:34.490 align:middle line:10%
There are certain
mechanical systems

00:04:34.490 --> 00:04:37.630 align:middle line:10%
that we create that
are decomposable.

00:04:37.630 --> 00:04:40.350 align:middle line:90%
A bicycle is decomposable.

00:04:40.350 --> 00:04:43.590 align:middle line:84%
You can take the steering
rod or the pedal.

00:04:43.590 --> 00:04:47.490 align:middle line:84%
And if it doesn't work well,
doesn't run well, doesn't turn,

00:04:47.490 --> 00:04:48.840 align:middle line:90%
then fix it.

00:04:48.840 --> 00:04:51.870 align:middle line:10%
You put it back
and it works again.

00:04:51.870 --> 00:04:55.350 align:middle line:84%
You can't take an
organ from an organism

00:04:55.350 --> 00:04:57.870 align:middle line:84%
and try to fix it and
put it back again.

00:04:57.870 --> 00:04:59.910 align:middle line:90%
These are whole systems.

00:04:59.910 --> 00:05:01.890 align:middle line:84%
And every part of
it is interacting

00:05:01.890 --> 00:05:03.990 align:middle line:90%
with every other part.

00:05:03.990 --> 00:05:08.430 align:middle line:84%
And all together are dedicated
to this sole basic task,

00:05:08.430 --> 00:05:14.390 align:middle line:84%
maintain the system in its
current state of life, living.

00:05:14.390 --> 00:05:17.330 align:middle line:84%
Every system, if
it's not living,

00:05:17.330 --> 00:05:21.480 align:middle line:84%
if it's not dynamic,
biological, sociobiological,

00:05:21.480 --> 00:05:25.910 align:middle line:84%
sociopsychobiological system,
it turns to this lowest level

00:05:25.910 --> 00:05:27.630 align:middle line:90%
of equilibrium.

00:05:27.630 --> 00:05:32.250 align:middle line:84%
It goes back to the basic,
just becomes balanced,

00:05:32.250 --> 00:05:34.310 align:middle line:90%
but at the lowest level.

00:05:34.310 --> 00:05:37.420 align:middle line:84%
And then life is not possible
at that lowest level.

00:05:37.420 --> 00:05:40.310 align:middle line:84%
Sure death is to
return to equilibrium

00:05:40.310 --> 00:05:42.020 align:middle line:90%
in the physical sense.

00:05:42.020 --> 00:05:46.820 align:middle line:84%
Every part, every cell
returns to its bottom state,

00:05:46.820 --> 00:05:48.260 align:middle line:90%
ground state.

00:05:48.260 --> 00:05:50.180 align:middle line:90%
But they don't work together.

00:05:50.180 --> 00:05:52.580 align:middle line:84%
To be alive means
to be constantly

00:05:52.580 --> 00:05:57.980 align:middle line:84%
out of this bottom equilibrium
and in a dynamic balance,

00:05:57.980 --> 00:06:00.420 align:middle line:90%
where things work together.

00:06:00.420 --> 00:06:04.880 align:middle line:84%
The system in which we
live, the human system,

00:06:04.880 --> 00:06:10.550 align:middle line:84%
as all living systems, is
an open, dynamic system.

00:06:10.550 --> 00:06:15.320 align:middle line:84%
Open means that the system
is available to flows,

00:06:15.320 --> 00:06:21.240 align:middle line:84%
is transitory to flows of
energy, meta, or information.

00:06:21.240 --> 00:06:24.080 align:middle line:84%
By meta, I don't mean
something metaphysical.

00:06:24.080 --> 00:06:26.420 align:middle line:84%
At this point I just
mean the substances

00:06:26.420 --> 00:06:28.220 align:middle line:90%
that flow through it.

00:06:28.220 --> 00:06:31.370 align:middle line:84%
Every time we take a breath,
we take in oxygen. Every time

00:06:31.370 --> 00:06:34.980 align:middle line:84%
we eat a sandwich,
we take in protein.

00:06:34.980 --> 00:06:36.560 align:middle line:90%
It's all coming in.

00:06:36.560 --> 00:06:38.790 align:middle line:84%
It's being digested,
being processed.

00:06:38.790 --> 00:06:40.340 align:middle line:90%
It's going out again.

00:06:40.340 --> 00:06:41.940 align:middle line:90%
And we are a flow.

00:06:41.940 --> 00:06:46.590 align:middle line:84%
We are a flow just the same way
as a candle is a flow process.

00:06:46.590 --> 00:06:50.660 align:middle line:84%
When we light it, that flame
eats through the candle,

00:06:50.660 --> 00:06:53.530 align:middle line:84%
goes through the
candle, and transforms

00:06:53.530 --> 00:06:58.520 align:middle line:84%
the light into heat,
and then into the oxygen

00:06:58.520 --> 00:07:04.940 align:middle line:84%
process, which melts the candle
and converts it into light,

00:07:04.940 --> 00:07:09.230 align:middle line:84%
so a flow process, in which
we are a transitory pattern.

00:07:09.230 --> 00:07:13.640 align:middle line:84%
Now, that pattern
who we are has to be

00:07:13.640 --> 00:07:18.980 align:middle line:84%
related to the pattern
which is there in nature.

00:07:18.980 --> 00:07:23.840 align:middle line:84%
So to put it in simple
terms, we healthy human--

00:07:23.840 --> 00:07:28.400 align:middle line:84%
normal, let's say, human
beings are a pattern

00:07:28.400 --> 00:07:32.210 align:middle line:84%
which is aligned with
the global pattern, which

00:07:32.210 --> 00:07:37.380 align:middle line:84%
reflects our health,
which gives us our health.

00:07:37.380 --> 00:07:41.240 align:middle line:84%
Once we are healthy,
we are one with nature.

00:07:41.240 --> 00:07:46.010 align:middle line:84%
That's the current expression
for it, being one with nature.

00:07:46.010 --> 00:07:49.070 align:middle line:84%
Very, very different
from the medical practice

00:07:49.070 --> 00:07:52.730 align:middle line:84%
of these days, where it says
if something is not right,

00:07:52.730 --> 00:07:56.770 align:middle line:84%
doesn't work right, you
change the biochemistry.

00:07:56.770 --> 00:08:00.500 align:middle line:84%
If that doesn't work, you
excise it, if you can,

00:08:00.500 --> 00:08:01.490 align:middle line:90%
and then you kill it.

00:08:01.490 --> 00:08:04.520 align:middle line:84%
Take for example what happens
with cancer, which is perhaps

00:08:04.520 --> 00:08:07.370 align:middle line:90%
the most horrendous disease.

00:08:07.370 --> 00:08:10.550 align:middle line:84%
If there's any part,
these tumors show up,

00:08:10.550 --> 00:08:15.470 align:middle line:84%
then the standard practice
is try to kill those cells.

00:08:15.470 --> 00:08:18.050 align:middle line:84%
If you can't fully
kill them, excise them.

00:08:18.050 --> 00:08:20.930 align:middle line:84%
Operate on the
organism, take it out.

00:08:20.930 --> 00:08:23.870 align:middle line:84%
Then of course, they are dead,
they are out of the organism.

00:08:23.870 --> 00:08:27.050 align:middle line:84%
And then you hope that
the organism recovers.

00:08:27.050 --> 00:08:28.490 align:middle line:90%
Sometimes it does.

00:08:28.490 --> 00:08:32.000 align:middle line:84%
Often it does not,
because what is wrong

00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:36.620 align:middle line:84%
here is the whole
orientation, the whole dynamic

00:08:36.620 --> 00:08:39.470 align:middle line:90%
of the organism.

00:08:39.470 --> 00:08:42.770 align:middle line:84%
It's not being guided
by the pattern which

00:08:42.770 --> 00:08:45.800 align:middle line:90%
is there in nature.

00:08:45.800 --> 00:08:49.980 align:middle line:84%
To return to nature, we
have to re-code ourselves.

00:08:49.980 --> 00:08:52.950 align:middle line:90%
We have to open up our antenna.

00:08:52.950 --> 00:08:56.900 align:middle line:84%
Now, this can be done in
many very different ways.

00:08:56.900 --> 00:08:59.330 align:middle line:84%
You can ask, how did
they always do it?

00:08:59.330 --> 00:09:02.540 align:middle line:84%
Traditional societies were
healthier on the whole

00:09:02.540 --> 00:09:04.820 align:middle line:90%
than we are.

00:09:04.820 --> 00:09:06.950 align:middle line:90%
They lived more in nature.

00:09:06.950 --> 00:09:09.670 align:middle line:84%
So one thing that we
are discovering today,

00:09:09.670 --> 00:09:12.830 align:middle line:84%
and there's very good
medical evidence for this,

00:09:12.830 --> 00:09:15.530 align:middle line:84%
people who spend
more time in nature

00:09:15.530 --> 00:09:17.540 align:middle line:90%
are less prone to disease.

00:09:17.540 --> 00:09:19.670 align:middle line:90%
They are healthier.

00:09:19.670 --> 00:09:21.425 align:middle line:84%
Something that is
ancient practice

00:09:21.425 --> 00:09:26.360 align:middle line:84%
is now being rediscovered,
for example the forest walk.

00:09:26.360 --> 00:09:31.480 align:middle line:84%
The forest walk, just get into
a forest and try to walk around

00:09:31.480 --> 00:09:34.720 align:middle line:84%
and feel yourself
part of that forest.

00:09:34.720 --> 00:09:38.370 align:middle line:84%
And it turns out that people
who do that regularly, they

00:09:38.370 --> 00:09:41.540 align:middle line:84%
are healthier and
less prone to disease.

00:09:41.540 --> 00:09:44.470 align:middle line:84%
Now, forests very
often, unfortunately,

00:09:44.470 --> 00:09:49.159 align:middle line:84%
in our day and age are not
available to everybody.

00:09:49.159 --> 00:09:50.950 align:middle line:84%
And when they are
available, sometimes they

00:09:50.950 --> 00:09:54.300 align:middle line:84%
are not pristine
forests anymore.

00:09:54.300 --> 00:09:55.590 align:middle line:90%
So we have to compensate.

00:09:55.590 --> 00:09:59.890 align:middle line:84%
That means medicine can
come in as an active force

00:09:59.890 --> 00:10:04.271 align:middle line:84%
re-establishing our
contact with nature.

00:10:04.271 --> 00:10:07.580 align:middle line:84%
It would be ideal if we could
just all get out to nature

00:10:07.580 --> 00:10:10.100 align:middle line:84%
and feel ourselves
being part of nature,

00:10:10.100 --> 00:10:14.930 align:middle line:84%
relax, meditate, talk to
each other or to ourselves,

00:10:14.930 --> 00:10:17.360 align:middle line:84%
and feel nature in
every part of our body.

00:10:17.360 --> 00:10:18.810 align:middle line:90%
That would be ideal.

00:10:18.810 --> 00:10:20.120 align:middle line:90%
We can't always do that.

00:10:20.120 --> 00:10:21.740 align:middle line:84%
And when there are
diseases already

00:10:21.740 --> 00:10:26.270 align:middle line:84%
shown up, when already has
been this disconnected--

00:10:26.270 --> 00:10:29.120 align:middle line:84%
this disconnect,
then you need to do

00:10:29.120 --> 00:10:31.410 align:middle line:90%
some more active measures.

00:10:31.410 --> 00:10:33.890 align:middle line:84%
Now, there are things
that we can do.

00:10:33.890 --> 00:10:37.250 align:middle line:84%
And there is a modern
branch of medicine

00:10:37.250 --> 00:10:39.080 align:middle line:84%
which is based on
energy and information.

00:10:39.080 --> 00:10:42.680 align:middle line:84%
It's called energy medicine
or information medicine.

00:10:42.680 --> 00:10:46.610 align:middle line:84%
Let me tell you an experience
or a new development

00:10:46.610 --> 00:10:49.490 align:middle line:84%
about information
medicine that I

00:10:49.490 --> 00:10:53.420 align:middle line:84%
have been involved with in a
modest way, because I suggested

00:10:53.420 --> 00:10:56.690 align:middle line:84%
some treatment along these
lines and it turned out

00:10:56.690 --> 00:10:59.220 align:middle line:90%
that this treatment works.

00:10:59.220 --> 00:11:01.550 align:middle line:90%
What is the mission?

00:11:01.550 --> 00:11:03.320 align:middle line:90%
What is the task?

00:11:03.320 --> 00:11:08.030 align:middle line:84%
The task is to align the
programming of the cells

00:11:08.030 --> 00:11:13.310 align:middle line:84%
in the organism in such a
way that work coherently.

00:11:13.310 --> 00:11:17.900 align:middle line:84%
Let's think about for one moment
this term again, coherence.

00:11:17.900 --> 00:11:21.710 align:middle line:84%
When the organism is
healthy, then it's coherent.

00:11:21.710 --> 00:11:25.100 align:middle line:84%
And by coherence, we
mean that every cell

00:11:25.100 --> 00:11:28.460 align:middle line:84%
is programmed to
coherent functioning,

00:11:28.460 --> 00:11:32.870 align:middle line:84%
complementary functioning,
contact with every other cell.

00:11:32.870 --> 00:11:36.350 align:middle line:84%
Every organ is tuned
to every other organ,

00:11:36.350 --> 00:11:40.220 align:middle line:84%
so the whole system
works as one system,

00:11:40.220 --> 00:11:42.710 align:middle line:90%
which is healthy and whole.

00:11:42.710 --> 00:11:47.490 align:middle line:84%
The idea was on this particular
discovery to ask when,

00:11:47.490 --> 00:11:50.570 align:middle line:84%
at what point in the
life of an organism

00:11:50.570 --> 00:11:54.910 align:middle line:84%
is this information really
accessible, really there,

00:11:54.910 --> 00:12:00.130 align:middle line:84%
full information on which the
organism runs, full contact

00:12:00.130 --> 00:12:04.500 align:middle line:90%
with this pattern in nature?

00:12:04.500 --> 00:12:07.610 align:middle line:84%
And the answer is, at the
very beginning of life.

00:12:07.610 --> 00:12:10.530 align:middle line:84%
In a complex system,
it's the embryo.

00:12:10.530 --> 00:12:13.690 align:middle line:84%
In the embryo, in the
very first phases,

00:12:13.690 --> 00:12:17.880 align:middle line:84%
when the cells of the
embryo multiply from 2 to 4

00:12:17.880 --> 00:12:21.750 align:middle line:84%
to 8 to 16, 32, and so on,
they don't really change yet,

00:12:21.750 --> 00:12:23.790 align:middle line:90%
but they multiply.

00:12:23.790 --> 00:12:27.240 align:middle line:84%
And at that point,
the full information

00:12:27.240 --> 00:12:31.050 align:middle line:84%
of the mother organism
is present in the embryo.

00:12:31.050 --> 00:12:34.350 align:middle line:84%
When organs start forming,
then that information

00:12:34.350 --> 00:12:38.070 align:middle line:84%
is no longer fully present,
because then the cells, which

00:12:38.070 --> 00:12:41.700 align:middle line:84%
up until then were capable
of developing, evolving

00:12:41.700 --> 00:12:45.790 align:middle line:84%
into any cell in the organism,
all the possibilities

00:12:45.790 --> 00:12:46.590 align:middle line:90%
are there--

00:12:46.590 --> 00:12:51.720 align:middle line:84%
it's called totipotent,
total potency of the cells.

00:12:51.720 --> 00:12:56.040 align:middle line:84%
Any one cell can become any
other cell in the organism.

00:12:56.040 --> 00:12:59.760 align:middle line:84%
Once the organs have
formed, then the cells--

00:12:59.760 --> 00:13:03.490 align:middle line:84%
some of these cells have
become multi-potent.

00:13:03.490 --> 00:13:06.990 align:middle line:84%
That means there can be
some of the other cells,

00:13:06.990 --> 00:13:08.430 align:middle line:90%
but not all anymore.

00:13:08.430 --> 00:13:10.660 align:middle line:84%
So the full information
is not there.

00:13:10.660 --> 00:13:13.110 align:middle line:84%
So let's think of
the full information

00:13:13.110 --> 00:13:15.810 align:middle line:90%
before the organs are generated.

00:13:15.810 --> 00:13:19.560 align:middle line:84%
First thing to note is
that in the laboratory,

00:13:19.560 --> 00:13:25.350 align:middle line:84%
when you inject into that
embryo in that primary phase--

00:13:25.350 --> 00:13:31.800 align:middle line:84%
inject a virus that has cancer
and cancer information into it,

00:13:31.800 --> 00:13:33.330 align:middle line:90%
it doesn't take.

00:13:33.330 --> 00:13:38.060 align:middle line:84%
The embryo simply
doesn't pick up cancer.

00:13:38.060 --> 00:13:41.240 align:middle line:84%
Apparently, it won't pick
up other diseases as well.

00:13:41.240 --> 00:13:45.950 align:middle line:84%
The experiments were
specifically on cancer.

00:13:45.950 --> 00:13:48.690 align:middle line:90%
Now, how do you access this?

00:13:48.690 --> 00:13:50.730 align:middle line:84%
You should take some
part of that embryo

00:13:50.730 --> 00:13:54.930 align:middle line:84%
at that particular
early phase and make

00:13:54.930 --> 00:13:58.440 align:middle line:84%
it available to a
sick human being.

00:13:58.440 --> 00:14:01.350 align:middle line:90%
Why is that likely to work?

00:14:01.350 --> 00:14:05.610 align:middle line:84%
It is very likely to work
because at that point

00:14:05.610 --> 00:14:10.500 align:middle line:84%
the cells become normal
cells, differentiate

00:14:10.500 --> 00:14:13.950 align:middle line:84%
into normal healthy cells
of a coming organism,

00:14:13.950 --> 00:14:16.590 align:middle line:90%
of a developing organism.

00:14:16.590 --> 00:14:20.250 align:middle line:84%
And we have many cells
like this in our body.

00:14:20.250 --> 00:14:23.950 align:middle line:84%
They are known as stem
cells, the original cells.

00:14:23.950 --> 00:14:27.780 align:middle line:84%
Out of the stem cells
come differentiation

00:14:27.780 --> 00:14:29.010 align:middle line:90%
in the organism.

00:14:29.010 --> 00:14:32.460 align:middle line:84%
The organism is
formed of these cells.

00:14:32.460 --> 00:14:35.250 align:middle line:84%
Now, when the embryo
starts differentiating,

00:14:35.250 --> 00:14:37.860 align:middle line:84%
what it does is the
same thing that a stem

00:14:37.860 --> 00:14:40.380 align:middle line:84%
cell in the human
body needs to do,

00:14:40.380 --> 00:14:43.560 align:middle line:84%
differentiate to
become a normal cell.

00:14:43.560 --> 00:14:45.270 align:middle line:84%
If that stem cell
is in the bone,

00:14:45.270 --> 00:14:46.833 align:middle line:90%
it has to become a bone cell.

00:14:46.833 --> 00:14:49.333 align:middle line:84%
If it is in the brain, it has
to become a brain cell, and so

00:14:49.333 --> 00:14:50.820 align:middle line:90%
on in the whole organism.

00:14:50.820 --> 00:14:55.230 align:middle line:84%
150 or more different kinds
of cells, and the stem cells

00:14:55.230 --> 00:14:58.960 align:middle line:84%
are capable of differentiating
into any one of these.

00:14:58.960 --> 00:15:03.150 align:middle line:84%
Now, if you get this
information from the embryo

00:15:03.150 --> 00:15:05.900 align:middle line:90%
of another organism.

00:15:05.900 --> 00:15:11.490 align:middle line:84%
Then we can induce the stem
cells to become normal cells.

00:15:11.490 --> 00:15:14.970 align:middle line:84%
If they were malignant,
if they were mutant,

00:15:14.970 --> 00:15:18.300 align:middle line:84%
then the cells get
reprogrammed and differentiate

00:15:18.300 --> 00:15:19.800 align:middle line:90%
into normal cells.

00:15:19.800 --> 00:15:21.120 align:middle line:90%
There's another alternative.

00:15:21.120 --> 00:15:24.690 align:middle line:84%
If they can't be reprogrammed,
they undergo cell death.

00:15:24.690 --> 00:15:26.610 align:middle line:90%
It's known as apoptosis.

00:15:26.610 --> 00:15:29.070 align:middle line:90%
And these cells die off.

00:15:29.070 --> 00:15:32.310 align:middle line:84%
So if you have a tumor, for
example, the cells in the tumor

00:15:32.310 --> 00:15:35.850 align:middle line:84%
either die off,
leave the organism,

00:15:35.850 --> 00:15:38.220 align:middle line:84%
or they become
normal cells, which

00:15:38.220 --> 00:15:40.680 align:middle line:90%
is the ideal cure for cancer.

00:15:40.680 --> 00:15:43.560 align:middle line:84%
It is very different
from taking the cells

00:15:43.560 --> 00:15:45.970 align:middle line:84%
and killing it and hoping
that another cell will

00:15:45.970 --> 00:15:47.400 align:middle line:90%
come in its place.

00:15:47.400 --> 00:15:50.970 align:middle line:90%
Here, you reprogram the cells.

00:15:50.970 --> 00:15:53.800 align:middle line:10%
Where can you get
this information?

00:15:53.800 --> 00:15:55.810 align:middle line:10%
You have to get it
from another organism.

00:15:55.810 --> 00:15:57.518 align:middle line:10%
It would be beautiful
if you could get it

00:15:57.518 --> 00:15:59.820 align:middle line:10%
from a human embryo,
maybe not so beautiful,

00:15:59.820 --> 00:16:02.610 align:middle line:10%
because you would
damage the embryo if you

00:16:02.610 --> 00:16:05.400 align:middle line:10%
start extracting cells from it.

00:16:05.400 --> 00:16:07.050 align:middle line:90%
But it's not possible.

00:16:07.050 --> 00:16:10.070 align:middle line:84%
There are too many defenses
built into this system.

00:16:10.070 --> 00:16:13.800 align:middle line:84%
It will probably kill the
mother organism in the process.

00:16:13.800 --> 00:16:17.980 align:middle line:84%
So I said to my friends
the researchers, let's try

00:16:17.980 --> 00:16:21.180 align:middle line:84%
to go down the
scale of evolution

00:16:21.180 --> 00:16:24.450 align:middle line:84%
and see where you can
find an embryo where

00:16:24.450 --> 00:16:27.190 align:middle line:84%
this differentiation
process is such that it

00:16:27.190 --> 00:16:29.160 align:middle line:90%
will work in the human being.

00:16:29.160 --> 00:16:30.850 align:middle line:90%
So we went down the scale.

00:16:30.850 --> 00:16:33.480 align:middle line:84%
And you know where
they found it?

00:16:33.480 --> 00:16:35.280 align:middle line:90%
They found it in a tiny fish.

00:16:35.280 --> 00:16:38.300 align:middle line:90%
It's known as the zebrafish.

00:16:38.300 --> 00:16:41.250 align:middle line:84%
The zebrafish has
some advantages,

00:16:41.250 --> 00:16:44.250 align:middle line:84%
because it has been
very thoroughly studied.

00:16:44.250 --> 00:16:47.490 align:middle line:84%
They know exactly how it
develops to the second

00:16:47.490 --> 00:16:49.890 align:middle line:84%
or to the millisecond
practically,

00:16:49.890 --> 00:16:52.860 align:middle line:84%
how it starts to differentiate
and make another zebrafish

00:16:52.860 --> 00:16:57.700 align:middle line:84%
and how the embryo develops and
what happens at the given time.

00:16:57.700 --> 00:17:00.510 align:middle line:84%
What happens is a
constant dialogue

00:17:00.510 --> 00:17:04.190 align:middle line:84%
between that developing organism
and the mother, the mother

00:17:04.190 --> 00:17:05.849 align:middle line:90%
fish in this case.

00:17:05.849 --> 00:17:07.859 align:middle line:90%
And this is true of any embryo.

00:17:07.859 --> 00:17:10.230 align:middle line:84%
Between the mother and
the developing organism,

00:17:10.230 --> 00:17:12.890 align:middle line:84%
there is a constant
inflow, a dialogue.

00:17:12.890 --> 00:17:15.990 align:middle line:84%
Constantly the mother is
producing information.

00:17:15.990 --> 00:17:19.319 align:middle line:10%
It's being processed in
the cell, in the embryo,

00:17:19.319 --> 00:17:22.530 align:middle line:10%
and then in the fetus,
and then in the more

00:17:22.530 --> 00:17:24.630 align:middle line:10%
fully developed organism.

00:17:24.630 --> 00:17:30.420 align:middle line:84%
And from this information,
we can extract that element

00:17:30.420 --> 00:17:34.380 align:middle line:84%
which can induce the
stem cells in our body

00:17:34.380 --> 00:17:36.690 align:middle line:84%
or any sick body,
any other body,

00:17:36.690 --> 00:17:38.860 align:middle line:84%
to differentiate and
become normal cells.

00:17:38.860 --> 00:17:39.960 align:middle line:90%
Sounds fabulous.

00:17:39.960 --> 00:17:40.830 align:middle line:90%
It is.

00:17:40.830 --> 00:17:42.240 align:middle line:90%
It works actually.

00:17:42.240 --> 00:17:44.400 align:middle line:90%
That's why it's fabulous.

00:17:44.400 --> 00:17:51.440 align:middle line:84%
The zebrafish has 95% the
same DNA as a human being.

00:17:51.440 --> 00:17:54.500 align:middle line:84%
It's not known, but
practically all organisms,

00:17:54.500 --> 00:17:59.030 align:middle line:84%
living organisms on this planet
have basically the same set

00:17:59.030 --> 00:18:00.740 align:middle line:90%
of DNAs.

00:18:00.740 --> 00:18:03.630 align:middle line:84%
What is different
is not the DNA,

00:18:03.630 --> 00:18:06.560 align:middle line:84%
because that's the
genetic system.

00:18:06.560 --> 00:18:10.670 align:middle line:84%
What the difference is is
in the epigenetic system.

00:18:10.670 --> 00:18:14.840 align:middle line:84%
And that's another incredible
discovery the last few years.

00:18:14.840 --> 00:18:19.430 align:middle line:84%
This system is the
key to why we are here

00:18:19.430 --> 00:18:22.820 align:middle line:84%
and why the universe is
here, because it orders

00:18:22.820 --> 00:18:27.080 align:middle line:84%
the vibrations in such a
way that every element is

00:18:27.080 --> 00:18:30.870 align:middle line:84%
consistent, coherent
with every other element.

00:18:30.870 --> 00:18:34.350 align:middle line:84%
It's an information
management system operating

00:18:34.350 --> 00:18:37.470 align:middle line:90%
in the living organism.

00:18:37.470 --> 00:18:41.240 align:middle line:84%
The DNA is like the
keys of an instrument.

00:18:41.240 --> 00:18:44.250 align:middle line:84%
In themselves, the instrument
doesn't produce the music.

00:18:44.250 --> 00:18:46.320 align:middle line:84%
The keys are there
to produce the music,

00:18:46.320 --> 00:18:48.630 align:middle line:90%
but they don't in themselves.

00:18:48.630 --> 00:18:52.440 align:middle line:84%
What produces the music is the
way the keys are depressed,

00:18:52.440 --> 00:18:54.190 align:middle line:90%
the keys are operated.

00:18:54.190 --> 00:18:54.990 align:middle line:90%
Think of a piano.

00:18:54.990 --> 00:18:56.730 align:middle line:90%
You have to play that.

00:18:56.730 --> 00:19:00.900 align:middle line:84%
Or a violin, you have to play
it so as to have the music.

00:19:00.900 --> 00:19:04.320 align:middle line:84%
But just by themselves,
they're just they're.

00:19:04.320 --> 00:19:06.500 align:middle line:84%
What plays the
music, what creates

00:19:06.500 --> 00:19:10.090 align:middle line:84%
the music is the
epigenetic system.

00:19:10.090 --> 00:19:12.410 align:middle line:84%
This epigenetic
system is what makes

00:19:12.410 --> 00:19:16.470 align:middle line:84%
the difference between a
healthy organism and a sick one.

00:19:16.470 --> 00:19:18.770 align:middle line:90%
It activates given genes.

00:19:18.770 --> 00:19:20.820 align:middle line:90%
It suppresses given genes.

00:19:20.820 --> 00:19:22.080 align:middle line:90%
It makes them work.

00:19:22.080 --> 00:19:23.700 align:middle line:90%
It makes them pause.

00:19:23.700 --> 00:19:28.440 align:middle line:84%
It's what works so that the
living system is not just

00:19:28.440 --> 00:19:31.110 align:middle line:84%
a genetic system,
but a genetic system

00:19:31.110 --> 00:19:34.590 align:middle line:84%
governed by an
epigenetic system.

00:19:34.590 --> 00:19:37.950 align:middle line:84%
And what information
does is interacts

00:19:37.950 --> 00:19:41.130 align:middle line:90%
with the epigenetic system.

00:19:41.130 --> 00:19:45.180 align:middle line:84%
So we get this information
from the zebrafish.

00:19:45.180 --> 00:19:48.420 align:middle line:84%
It interacts with
the epigenetic system

00:19:48.420 --> 00:19:51.150 align:middle line:84%
of another organism, which
can be a human being suffering

00:19:51.150 --> 00:19:53.940 align:middle line:90%
from cancer, let's say.

00:19:53.940 --> 00:19:59.340 align:middle line:84%
And that information activates
the genes in such a way

00:19:59.340 --> 00:20:02.670 align:middle line:84%
that they differentiate,
that they produce

00:20:02.670 --> 00:20:05.310 align:middle line:90%
a differentiation in the cells.

00:20:05.310 --> 00:20:09.260 align:middle line:84%
We are a complex system, where
the epigenetic system governs

00:20:09.260 --> 00:20:13.500 align:middle line:84%
the whole
instrumentation of genes.

00:20:13.500 --> 00:20:15.540 align:middle line:84%
And the genes then
govern actually

00:20:15.540 --> 00:20:18.270 align:middle line:90%
what is happening to the system.

00:20:18.270 --> 00:20:20.700 align:middle line:84%
It's interesting that this
particular substance--

00:20:20.700 --> 00:20:24.300 align:middle line:84%
it has a complex name
from the zebrafish,

00:20:24.300 --> 00:20:27.480 align:middle line:84%
stem cell
differentiating factors.

00:20:27.480 --> 00:20:31.920 align:middle line:84%
What it does is differentiates
the cells of the embryo

00:20:31.920 --> 00:20:34.350 align:middle line:84%
and the stem cells in
the body in such a way

00:20:34.350 --> 00:20:37.520 align:middle line:84%
that they create a
healthy organism.

00:20:37.520 --> 00:20:39.930 align:middle line:84%
So again, just as
the other day we

00:20:39.930 --> 00:20:45.090 align:middle line:84%
talked about being part of a
deeper level of information

00:20:45.090 --> 00:20:48.360 align:middle line:84%
in the universe,
so our health is

00:20:48.360 --> 00:20:51.100 align:middle line:90%
originating at a deeper level.

00:20:51.100 --> 00:20:57.490 align:middle line:84%
We create this deeper
level by being part of it.

00:20:57.490 --> 00:21:03.060 align:middle line:84%
And we can access that by
having a substance that

00:21:03.060 --> 00:21:04.980 align:middle line:90%
conveys to us that level.

00:21:04.980 --> 00:21:08.840 align:middle line:90%


00:21:08.840 --> 00:21:11.770 align:middle line:84%
It turns out, namely,
that in the very beginning

00:21:11.770 --> 00:21:15.880 align:middle line:84%
of this embryo process,
development process,

00:21:15.880 --> 00:21:19.270 align:middle line:84%
there is a substance,
a DNA attached

00:21:19.270 --> 00:21:24.310 align:middle line:84%
to each cell in the embryo,
which is called telomerase.

00:21:24.310 --> 00:21:27.760 align:middle line:84%
And this telomerase is
what enables the cell

00:21:27.760 --> 00:21:30.760 align:middle line:84%
to multiply, to
duplicate itself.

00:21:30.760 --> 00:21:36.040 align:middle line:84%
But every duplication cuts off
some parts of the telomerase.

00:21:36.040 --> 00:21:40.760 align:middle line:84%
So soon, relatively soon,
after a number of replications,

00:21:40.760 --> 00:21:43.950 align:middle line:84%
the cell can no
longer replicate.

00:21:43.950 --> 00:21:47.030 align:middle line:84%
That's why we are mortal,
because our cells stop

00:21:47.030 --> 00:21:49.310 align:middle line:90%
being able to replicate.

00:21:49.310 --> 00:21:50.930 align:middle line:84%
Now, imagine if
the cells wouldn't

00:21:50.930 --> 00:21:55.850 align:middle line:84%
stop replicating, if they
could continue to replicate.

00:21:55.850 --> 00:21:57.510 align:middle line:90%
It turns out that they can.

00:21:57.510 --> 00:22:01.490 align:middle line:84%
In fact, they do replicate
continuously and perfectly

00:22:01.490 --> 00:22:03.620 align:middle line:90%
in the laboratory already.

00:22:03.620 --> 00:22:08.420 align:middle line:84%
You can create stem cells that
maintain their property almost

00:22:08.420 --> 00:22:09.530 align:middle line:90%
indefinitely.

00:22:09.530 --> 00:22:12.200 align:middle line:84%
And the supplies of stem
cells, which are constantly

00:22:12.200 --> 00:22:14.990 align:middle line:84%
needed in the pharma
industry, are now

00:22:14.990 --> 00:22:18.560 align:middle line:84%
produced in several
laboratories by this method.

00:22:18.560 --> 00:22:19.860 align:middle line:90%
What does it?

00:22:19.860 --> 00:22:24.890 align:middle line:84%
It does that the same factor
that creates differentiation

00:22:24.890 --> 00:22:27.770 align:middle line:84%
in the cell also
maintains the cell

00:22:27.770 --> 00:22:32.980 align:middle line:84%
in this state of perfect
replication in principle.

00:22:32.980 --> 00:22:34.670 align:middle line:90%
So far it's in principle.

00:22:34.670 --> 00:22:41.000 align:middle line:84%
But it's perfectly possible to
translate this into practice.

00:22:41.000 --> 00:22:45.080 align:middle line:84%
Cells could become
immortal and organs

00:22:45.080 --> 00:22:48.160 align:middle line:84%
based on the cells,
and organ systems,

00:22:48.160 --> 00:22:51.680 align:middle line:84%
could become immortal if
there's nothing else interfering

00:22:51.680 --> 00:22:53.360 align:middle line:90%
with them.

00:22:53.360 --> 00:22:56.510 align:middle line:84%
The telomerase is not cut
off in the first phase

00:22:56.510 --> 00:22:58.250 align:middle line:84%
of the development
of the embryo.

00:22:58.250 --> 00:22:59.630 align:middle line:90%
This we know.

00:22:59.630 --> 00:23:03.080 align:middle line:84%
And now we also know that
through this extract,

00:23:03.080 --> 00:23:06.650 align:middle line:84%
this differentiation
factors injected

00:23:06.650 --> 00:23:10.010 align:middle line:84%
into this culture made
up of these cells,

00:23:10.010 --> 00:23:12.410 align:middle line:90%
the telomerase is not cut off.

00:23:12.410 --> 00:23:14.810 align:middle line:90%
The cells continue to multiply.

00:23:14.810 --> 00:23:19.160 align:middle line:84%
So you might say, are we on
the way to becoming immortal?

00:23:19.160 --> 00:23:20.805 align:middle line:90%
In principle we could.

00:23:20.805 --> 00:23:23.570 align:middle line:84%
But what is certainly
the case, we

00:23:23.570 --> 00:23:28.220 align:middle line:84%
could extend human
lifespan, healthy lifespan,

00:23:28.220 --> 00:23:30.030 align:middle line:84%
because the cells,
healthy cells,

00:23:30.030 --> 00:23:33.590 align:middle line:84%
would continue to act,
to be in the body,

00:23:33.590 --> 00:23:36.180 align:middle line:90%
and to function normally.

00:23:36.180 --> 00:23:39.170 align:middle line:84%
The limitation is
removed, not completely

00:23:39.170 --> 00:23:43.240 align:middle line:84%
because other things are in
the organism that interfere.

00:23:43.240 --> 00:23:46.580 align:middle line:84%
But in principle,
cells can continue

00:23:46.580 --> 00:23:50.160 align:middle line:84%
to be active in a healthy
way longer than before.

00:23:50.160 --> 00:23:51.800 align:middle line:90%
That's the bottom line.

00:23:51.800 --> 00:23:54.260 align:middle line:84%
And this soon will
become available.

00:23:54.260 --> 00:23:56.870 align:middle line:84%
So even if we don't become
immediately immortal,

00:23:56.870 --> 00:24:01.550 align:middle line:84%
we can live longer in a
healthy way than we did before.

00:24:01.550 --> 00:24:08.360 align:middle line:84%
This is probably as
fundamental as the phase

00:24:08.360 --> 00:24:11.910 align:middle line:84%
originally with the discovery
of the circulation of the blood,

00:24:11.910 --> 00:24:13.080 align:middle line:90%
for example.

00:24:13.080 --> 00:24:16.110 align:middle line:84%
It was not even so long
ago that this was not known

00:24:16.110 --> 00:24:18.510 align:middle line:90%
that the blood circulates.

00:24:18.510 --> 00:24:20.590 align:middle line:84%
It's a different kind
of a system, which

00:24:20.590 --> 00:24:23.740 align:middle line:84%
is based on this
constant input of oxygen

00:24:23.740 --> 00:24:26.390 align:middle line:90%
provided by the blood.

00:24:26.390 --> 00:24:30.010 align:middle line:84%
This is similarly a
groundbreaking discovery,

00:24:30.010 --> 00:24:34.210 align:middle line:84%
that information is
constantly produced,

00:24:34.210 --> 00:24:40.670 align:middle line:84%
inputted into the organism,
and produces a healthy system.

00:24:40.670 --> 00:24:41.930 align:middle line:90%
We can help.

00:24:41.930 --> 00:24:48.500 align:middle line:84%
We can help this natural flow
of not being so much in touch

00:24:48.500 --> 00:24:49.490 align:middle line:90%
with nature.

00:24:49.490 --> 00:24:53.150 align:middle line:90%
We can help it by medical means.

00:24:53.150 --> 00:24:56.570 align:middle line:84%
But informational medical
means, not just biochemical

00:24:56.570 --> 00:24:59.600 align:middle line:90%
means, and not surgical means.

00:24:59.600 --> 00:25:04.130 align:middle line:84%
We let nature do
what nature can do.

00:25:04.130 --> 00:25:06.840 align:middle line:90%
And we just help it.

00:25:06.840 --> 00:25:12.160 align:middle line:84%
We don't need to do the
artificial therapies that

00:25:12.160 --> 00:25:14.960 align:middle line:84%
up until now have
dominated medicine.

00:25:14.960 --> 00:25:18.410 align:middle line:84%
This is now becoming available
for certain diseases,

00:25:18.410 --> 00:25:21.680 align:middle line:84%
tumoral diseases, yes;
neurodegenerative diseases

00:25:21.680 --> 00:25:26.510 align:middle line:84%
also, Alzheimer's, Parkinson's,
multiple sclerosis,

00:25:26.510 --> 00:25:27.740 align:middle line:90%
all of these.

00:25:27.740 --> 00:25:31.860 align:middle line:84%
We can show because the
clinical tests show this.

00:25:31.860 --> 00:25:34.970 align:middle line:84%
We can show, for example,
with ultrasound methods how

00:25:34.970 --> 00:25:38.510 align:middle line:84%
tumors that at one point in
the liver just was taking over,

00:25:38.510 --> 00:25:42.410 align:middle line:84%
growing, growing, starts
stopping growth, start

00:25:42.410 --> 00:25:43.760 align:middle line:90%
degenerating.

00:25:43.760 --> 00:25:47.420 align:middle line:84%
And after several weeks,
the tumors disappear.

00:25:47.420 --> 00:25:49.980 align:middle line:90%
The liver becomes healthy again.

00:25:49.980 --> 00:25:51.710 align:middle line:90%
So it's not just imagination.

00:25:51.710 --> 00:25:53.210 align:middle line:90%
We have the clinical tests.

00:25:53.210 --> 00:25:57.790 align:middle line:84%
And that means a deeper
cause is at work here,

00:25:57.790 --> 00:26:00.890 align:middle line:84%
a deeper process, the
process that we are again

00:26:00.890 --> 00:26:03.890 align:middle line:84%
becoming part of
the universe, part

00:26:03.890 --> 00:26:07.610 align:middle line:84%
of the information on which
the universe runs, whether we

00:26:07.610 --> 00:26:10.130 align:middle line:84%
take a pill and let it
dissolve in our mouth

00:26:10.130 --> 00:26:14.810 align:middle line:84%
and help it like that, or we
walk in the forest or we swim

00:26:14.810 --> 00:26:20.060 align:middle line:84%
or we meditate,
become healthy again.

00:26:20.060 --> 00:26:21.800 align:middle line:90%
That's a new phase.

00:26:21.800 --> 00:26:23.900 align:middle line:84%
And it's a phase
that can correct

00:26:23.900 --> 00:26:31.370 align:middle line:84%
for the tremendously polluted,
tremendously misplaced

00:26:31.370 --> 00:26:38.120 align:middle line:84%
chemistry with which we are
over-flooding our environment.

00:26:38.120 --> 00:26:41.240 align:middle line:84%
That's the way for
internal health,

00:26:41.240 --> 00:26:44.150 align:middle line:84%
for organic health
based on information,

00:26:44.150 --> 00:26:47.120 align:middle line:90%
nature's information.

00:26:47.120 --> 00:26:50.170 align:middle line:90%
