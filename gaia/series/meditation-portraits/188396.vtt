00:00:05.916 --> 00:00:09.367 align:middle line:10%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:09.367 --> 00:00:11.360 align:middle line:90%


00:00:11.360 --> 00:00:13.970 align:middle line:84%
>> If you think of the moments
in your life that are just

00:00:13.970 --> 00:00:20.150 align:middle line:84%
so off the charts,
exciting, or fulfilling,

00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:23.360 align:middle line:84%
they are the moments when
you are really connected.

00:00:23.360 --> 00:00:36.990 align:middle line:90%


00:00:36.990 --> 00:00:42.870 align:middle line:84%
I was Congressman at
29 and doing all right.

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:46.290 align:middle line:10%
And then in 2008 after being in
Congress for about six years,

00:00:46.290 --> 00:00:49.380 align:middle line:10%
and my life getting more and
more hectic, more and more

00:00:49.380 --> 00:00:51.570 align:middle line:10%
responsibilities,
more and more burdens,

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:55.620 align:middle line:10%
a lot of negative thoughts, a
lot of self-criticism of you

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:58.810 align:middle line:10%
can do better, why didn't you
do this, or why did you do that,

00:00:58.810 --> 00:01:00.840 align:middle line:10%
and really beating
yourself up to where

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:02.940 align:middle line:10%
I felt like I was
going to be burnt out.

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:04.157 align:middle line:90%
And I was 35 years old.

00:01:04.157 --> 00:01:06.240 align:middle line:84%
And I thought, you know,
I'm going to be burnt out

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:09.600 align:middle line:90%
by the time I'm 40.

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:11.640 align:middle line:84%
There was always
a sense growing up

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:14.820 align:middle line:84%
that there needed to
be a space, a time,

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:19.260 align:middle line:84%
for contemplation, for some
silence, for some prayer.

00:01:19.260 --> 00:01:21.960 align:middle line:84%
There were rosaries everywhere
in the house, on the chairs,

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:24.480 align:middle line:90%
on the bed posts.

00:01:24.480 --> 00:01:29.070 align:middle line:84%
I meditated on and off for
years with no real discipline.

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:31.680 align:middle line:84%
After the 2008
election, I really

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:35.505 align:middle line:84%
wanted to jump start a
daily meditation practice.

00:01:35.505 --> 00:01:41.750 align:middle line:90%


00:01:41.750 --> 00:01:45.580 align:middle line:90%
It really changed my life.

00:01:45.580 --> 00:01:49.210 align:middle line:84%
I really got a taste of what
it is like to have your mind

00:01:49.210 --> 00:01:51.130 align:middle line:90%
and your body synchronized.

00:01:51.130 --> 00:01:58.010 align:middle line:90%


00:01:58.010 --> 00:02:00.350 align:middle line:84%
Mindfulness is a
type of meditation

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:04.440 align:middle line:90%
that works on awareness.

00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:07.950 align:middle line:84%
We honor and respect that
athletes and the performers

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:10.470 align:middle line:84%
should do this all the
time, the musicians.

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:13.440 align:middle line:84%
When we see someone pay
attention completely, wholly,

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:16.410 align:middle line:84%
mind and body in the
same spot, we love that.

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:18.400 align:middle line:84%
We go to concerts,
we all sing along

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:21.720 align:middle line:84%
to the same song, all in unison,
all in the present moment,

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:22.740 align:middle line:90%
all being moved.

00:02:22.740 --> 00:02:30.400 align:middle line:90%


00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:32.560 align:middle line:84%
And after I got a
taste of it, I really

00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:34.870 align:middle line:84%
thought we have to introduce
this into the health care

00:02:34.870 --> 00:02:36.367 align:middle line:90%
system in America.

00:02:36.367 --> 00:02:40.615 align:middle line:90%


00:02:40.615 --> 00:02:42.480 align:middle line:84%
I'm on the Armed
Services Committee,

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:45.900 align:middle line:84%
which oversees the
entire policies that

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:50.100 align:middle line:84%
affect the men and women
in our armed services.

00:02:50.100 --> 00:02:52.020 align:middle line:84%
Part of what we're
working on now

00:02:52.020 --> 00:02:54.480 align:middle line:84%
is trying to really get
mindfulness training

00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:58.890 align:middle line:84%
and mind fitness training into
some of the basic training

00:02:58.890 --> 00:03:01.890 align:middle line:84%
that the men and women have
to get before they even

00:03:01.890 --> 00:03:05.220 align:middle line:84%
go overseas or become
fully certified

00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:06.975 align:middle line:90%
as soldiers for our country.

00:03:06.975 --> 00:03:10.260 align:middle line:90%


00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:12.980 align:middle line:84%
The openness has
really been surprising.

00:03:12.980 --> 00:03:15.710 align:middle line:84%
Members of Congress
pull me off to the side

00:03:15.710 --> 00:03:20.080 align:middle line:84%
and say, hey, what is this
you're talking about here.

00:03:20.080 --> 00:03:23.349 align:middle line:84%
Because I'm fried,
and I need something.

00:03:23.349 --> 00:03:30.340 align:middle line:90%


00:03:30.340 --> 00:03:33.580 align:middle line:84%
The greatest waste I think
we have in the country

00:03:33.580 --> 00:03:38.270 align:middle line:84%
today is the wasting
of our human resources

00:03:38.270 --> 00:03:42.610 align:middle line:84%
that go untapped, the
inner resources that we

00:03:42.610 --> 00:03:45.790 align:middle line:84%
have at our disposal
that we never tap into.

00:03:45.790 --> 00:03:49.440 align:middle line:90%


00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:51.630 align:middle line:84%
We don't need to go
further to the left

00:03:51.630 --> 00:03:53.320 align:middle line:90%
or further to the right.

00:03:53.320 --> 00:03:55.140 align:middle line:90%
We all need to go deeper.

00:03:55.140 --> 00:03:57.720 align:middle line:84%
We need everyone committed
to growing and developing

00:03:57.720 --> 00:04:00.060 align:middle line:84%
themselves to their
full potential.

00:04:00.060 --> 00:04:01.500 align:middle line:84%
Much of our talent
in this country

00:04:01.500 --> 00:04:04.200 align:middle line:90%
goes untapped and undeveloped.

00:04:04.200 --> 00:04:07.980 align:middle line:84%
It sits on the sidelines or is
pushed there because of fear,

00:04:07.980 --> 00:04:10.320 align:middle line:90%
doubt, and suffering.

00:04:10.320 --> 00:04:12.840 align:middle line:84%
This is an excerpt from my
book, "A Mindful Nation".

00:04:12.840 --> 00:04:16.170 align:middle line:90%


00:04:16.170 --> 00:04:20.459 align:middle line:84%
Every time I fly into New
York City, I think about 9/11,

00:04:20.459 --> 00:04:26.610 align:middle line:84%
and I think about the people
calling from the airplane

00:04:26.610 --> 00:04:28.990 align:middle line:90%
to their family members.

00:04:28.990 --> 00:04:32.912 align:middle line:84%
And they were all calling
to say I love you.

00:04:32.912 --> 00:04:35.010 align:middle line:84%
You know, that
was the last thing

00:04:35.010 --> 00:04:36.600 align:middle line:84%
they were going to
say to somebody.

00:04:36.600 --> 00:04:39.000 align:middle line:84%
Because at that point,
nothing else mattered.

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:41.700 align:middle line:90%


00:04:41.700 --> 00:04:43.230 align:middle line:90%
Everything else falls off.

00:04:43.230 --> 00:04:48.870 align:middle line:90%
I mean, all the BS is gone.

00:04:48.870 --> 00:04:55.252 align:middle line:84%
And it's just basic humanity,
a realization of the connection

00:04:55.252 --> 00:04:56.460 align:middle line:90%
that we have with each other.

00:04:56.460 --> 00:05:01.060 align:middle line:90%


00:05:01.060 --> 00:05:04.810 align:middle line:84%
We are born with
an understanding

00:05:04.810 --> 00:05:07.570 align:middle line:84%
that we need each
other to survive.

00:05:07.570 --> 00:05:09.880 align:middle line:84%
And our species has
evolved in a way

00:05:09.880 --> 00:05:13.000 align:middle line:84%
that we understand
at the deepest levels

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:14.500 align:middle line:84%
that we are connected
to each other.

00:05:14.500 --> 00:05:18.510 align:middle line:90%


00:05:18.510 --> 00:05:21.090 align:middle line:84%
Once we see we're
connected, I think

00:05:21.090 --> 00:05:22.740 align:middle line:90%
that will change our politics.

00:05:22.740 --> 00:05:28.140 align:middle line:84%
Because it's not the 1%,
the 99%, it's the 100%.

00:05:28.140 --> 00:05:29.530 align:middle line:90%
We're all in this together.

00:05:29.530 --> 00:05:32.290 align:middle line:90%
We're all connected.

00:05:32.290 --> 00:05:36.060 align:middle line:84%
So how do we figure out how to
bring that into our daily life?

00:05:36.060 --> 00:05:40.220 align:middle line:90%


00:05:40.220 --> 00:05:43.640 align:middle line:84%
I think it begins by developing
those inner resources

00:05:43.640 --> 00:05:46.910 align:middle line:84%
and teaching Americans
how to have and cultivate

00:05:46.910 --> 00:05:54.100 align:middle line:84%
that inner life, which
is, I think, fundamental.

00:05:54.100 --> 00:05:57.790 align:middle line:84%
My hope really is that by
slowing down and practicing

00:05:57.790 --> 00:05:59.500 align:middle line:84%
mindfulness in
whatever way people

00:05:59.500 --> 00:06:05.290 align:middle line:84%
see fit gets us back in tune
with that basic connection

00:06:05.290 --> 00:06:07.260 align:middle line:90%
that we have.

00:06:07.260 --> 00:06:38.000 align:middle line:90%
