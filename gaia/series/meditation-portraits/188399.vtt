00:00:01.497 --> 00:00:04.491 align:middle line:90%

00:00:04.491 --> 00:00:15.480 align:middle line:90%


00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:20.100 align:middle line:84%
>> We sort of live all our
life preparing to be happy.

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:23.830 align:middle line:84%
We never actually are happy
when we experience things.

00:00:23.830 --> 00:00:30.630 align:middle line:90%


00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:34.460 align:middle line:84%
My name is Nateya, and
I'm from New Guinea.

00:00:34.460 --> 00:00:38.580 align:middle line:84%
It's a very small little town
in the modern country of Nepal,

00:00:38.580 --> 00:00:41.030 align:middle line:84%
actually well known as the
birthplace of Lord Buddha.

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:42.750 align:middle line:90%
And I was born in that village.

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:46.010 align:middle line:84%
It gives me great
fortune to be born there.

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:49.920 align:middle line:84%
And I have devoted a
major part of my life

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:52.958 align:middle line:84%
in the study and practice
of Buddhist teachings.

00:00:52.958 --> 00:01:01.750 align:middle line:90%


00:01:01.750 --> 00:01:05.102 align:middle line:84%
When I started studying,
I went to college.

00:01:05.102 --> 00:01:06.560 align:middle line:84%
I was actually
enrolled in science,

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:09.514 align:middle line:90%
so I was doing physics and bio.

00:01:09.514 --> 00:01:10.660 align:middle line:90%
Fortunately, I quit.

00:01:10.660 --> 00:01:11.460 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:13.810 align:middle line:84%
Otherwise, I don't know
where I would end up.

00:01:13.810 --> 00:01:15.880 align:middle line:84%
Maybe some major in
college or something,

00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:17.890 align:middle line:84%
because my senior
brother is an engineer.

00:01:17.890 --> 00:01:19.790 align:middle line:84%
And that's what my
family wanted me to be.

00:01:19.790 --> 00:01:21.410 align:middle line:84%
Personally, I wanted
to be a doctor.

00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:25.300 align:middle line:84%
I thought maybe that way, I
can serve this society better.

00:01:25.300 --> 00:01:27.670 align:middle line:90%
What was I searching for?

00:01:27.670 --> 00:01:28.820 align:middle line:90%
What was I looking for?

00:01:28.820 --> 00:01:33.370 align:middle line:84%
What I really wanted to
do becomes very clear.

00:01:33.370 --> 00:01:36.060 align:middle line:84%
Just like Buddha, I
want to get enlightened.

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:38.190 align:middle line:84%
I have such a burning
desire, you know?

00:01:38.190 --> 00:01:42.920 align:middle line:90%


00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:44.590 align:middle line:84%
At that time, I was
trying to understand

00:01:44.590 --> 00:01:45.982 align:middle line:90%
what is this Western world.

00:01:45.982 --> 00:01:47.440 align:middle line:84%
Because by that
time, I had started

00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:50.530 align:middle line:84%
hearing about it, the Western
world, and the developed

00:01:50.530 --> 00:01:52.000 align:middle line:84%
countries, and all
of these ideas.

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:54.390 align:middle line:84%
I really wanted to
understand how it's going on.

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:57.220 align:middle line:84%
I realized that all
the genius people born

00:01:57.220 --> 00:02:00.910 align:middle line:84%
in Western hemisphere,
they've been somehow

00:02:00.910 --> 00:02:04.380 align:middle line:84%
naturally very interested
in searching that is outer.

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:07.931 align:middle line:84%
Like electricity
was discovered here.

00:02:07.931 --> 00:02:09.639 align:middle line:84%
So many other things,
these technologies,

00:02:09.639 --> 00:02:12.280 align:middle line:84%
the wonderful roads, the
buildings, and everything.

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:14.508 align:middle line:84%
How to design, how to
improve the life in outer.

00:02:14.508 --> 00:02:16.300 align:middle line:84%
And when I really
started searching deeply,

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:20.290 align:middle line:84%
I realized all the genius people
that were born in our culture,

00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:25.870 align:middle line:84%
in our Western world,
somehow annoyingly devoted

00:02:25.870 --> 00:02:27.850 align:middle line:84%
all their life, all
their time, trying

00:02:27.850 --> 00:02:31.795 align:middle line:84%
to find out something that
is inner, investigating mind.

00:02:31.795 --> 00:02:37.750 align:middle line:90%


00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:40.990 align:middle line:84%
Mind is a very
mysterious subject.

00:02:40.990 --> 00:02:46.772 align:middle line:84%
It has no shape, no
form, and no address.

00:02:46.772 --> 00:02:47.980 align:middle line:90%
We never know where it lives.

00:02:47.980 --> 00:02:52.786 align:middle line:90%


00:02:52.786 --> 00:02:55.720 align:middle line:84%
So we say that
closest link to reach

00:02:55.720 --> 00:02:59.090 align:middle line:84%
to the mind is with
the body, our own body.

00:02:59.090 --> 00:03:02.560 align:middle line:84%
And we can say, for example,
when we are very angry,

00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:05.030 align:middle line:84%
and let's say our mind is
very angry at something,

00:03:05.030 --> 00:03:07.660 align:middle line:84%
we start showing
result in our body.

00:03:07.660 --> 00:03:09.010 align:middle line:90%
Our heartbeats raise up.

00:03:09.010 --> 00:03:11.070 align:middle line:90%
Our breathing becomes very fast.

00:03:11.070 --> 00:03:13.590 align:middle line:84%
We start feeling hardened
when bad things happen.

00:03:13.590 --> 00:03:16.430 align:middle line:84%
So the ritual in a way
is to train the body.

00:03:16.430 --> 00:03:19.890 align:middle line:90%


00:03:19.890 --> 00:03:24.106 align:middle line:84%
When we calm down our
body, make it relaxed,

00:03:24.106 --> 00:03:28.130 align:middle line:84%
it becomes able to identify
the mind and work with it.

00:03:28.130 --> 00:03:33.870 align:middle line:90%


00:03:33.870 --> 00:03:39.210 align:middle line:84%
There are certain facts, certain
truths about the universe,

00:03:39.210 --> 00:03:42.290 align:middle line:90%
that affect every single thing.

00:03:42.290 --> 00:03:46.730 align:middle line:90%


00:03:46.730 --> 00:03:49.970 align:middle line:84%
When we start observing, a
very universal phenomenon

00:03:49.970 --> 00:03:50.900 align:middle line:90%
starts arising.

00:03:50.900 --> 00:03:54.380 align:middle line:84%
It starts becoming very
apparent that things change,

00:03:54.380 --> 00:03:58.720 align:middle line:90%
things are evolving constantly.

00:03:58.720 --> 00:04:02.770 align:middle line:84%
When we begin the observing
around, very absolutely

00:04:02.770 --> 00:04:05.380 align:middle line:84%
doing nothing from our
side and just observing,

00:04:05.380 --> 00:04:07.060 align:middle line:90%
reality starts appearing.

00:04:07.060 --> 00:04:09.430 align:middle line:84%
We start seeing that
our minds are changing,

00:04:09.430 --> 00:04:11.170 align:middle line:84%
our thoughts are
changing, our emotions

00:04:11.170 --> 00:04:12.790 align:middle line:90%
are changing all the time.

00:04:12.790 --> 00:04:16.070 align:middle line:84%
Also outside, the
seasons are changing.

00:04:16.070 --> 00:04:16.945 align:middle line:90%
Everything is moving.

00:04:16.945 --> 00:04:25.310 align:middle line:90%


00:04:25.310 --> 00:04:27.950 align:middle line:84%
This is a universal
principle, a universal law

00:04:27.950 --> 00:04:31.940 align:middle line:84%
that affects and governs
every single entity in it.

00:04:31.940 --> 00:04:34.190 align:middle line:84%
And it also affects
our own life.

00:04:34.190 --> 00:04:37.910 align:middle line:84%
From our thoughts, to our
environment, to our community.

00:04:37.910 --> 00:04:41.390 align:middle line:84%
It says when we meditate,
we become aware and develop

00:04:41.390 --> 00:04:45.060 align:middle line:84%
a quality to be able to perceive
that everything is changing.

00:04:45.060 --> 00:04:54.800 align:middle line:90%


00:04:54.800 --> 00:04:57.170 align:middle line:84%
Once that starts
becoming apparent,

00:04:57.170 --> 00:05:00.110 align:middle line:84%
we start connecting ourselves
to this bigger phenomenon that's

00:05:00.110 --> 00:05:02.237 align:middle line:90%
all around us.

00:05:02.237 --> 00:05:03.320 align:middle line:90%
This is the enlightenment.

00:05:03.320 --> 00:05:06.740 align:middle line:84%
This is this state leading
towards the enlightenment.

00:05:06.740 --> 00:05:08.487 align:middle line:90%
That gives us a profound peace.

00:05:08.487 --> 00:05:09.737 align:middle line:90%
That's the beginning of peace.

00:05:09.737 --> 00:05:17.370 align:middle line:90%


00:05:17.370 --> 00:05:20.790 align:middle line:84%
My initial question was
something like a seed.

00:05:20.790 --> 00:05:23.467 align:middle line:90%
And over the years, it evolved.

00:05:23.467 --> 00:05:25.050 align:middle line:84%
There were roots,
there were branches,

00:05:25.050 --> 00:05:29.480 align:middle line:84%
and several other things
that started happening.

00:05:29.480 --> 00:05:32.000 align:middle line:84%
And I started searching for
something else and something

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:32.800 align:middle line:90%
else.

00:05:32.800 --> 00:05:36.400 align:middle line:84%
So it has been a
continuously evolving search.

00:05:36.400 --> 00:06:09.000 align:middle line:90%
