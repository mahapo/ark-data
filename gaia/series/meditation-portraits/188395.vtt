00:00:28.100 --> 00:00:28.900 align:middle line:90%
It makes me cry.

>> Why does it make you cry?

00:00:32.560 --> 00:00:34.910 align:middle line:84%

practicing Kundalini right,

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:36.280 align:middle line:90%

00:00:48.340 --> 00:00:51.250 align:middle line:84%
When I was 16 years old, I
really struggled with anxiety,

00:00:51.250 --> 00:00:54.350 align:middle line:84%
and my mom taught
me how to meditate.

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:57.440 align:middle line:84%
But then, like most adolescents,
I turned my back on that truth

00:00:57.440 --> 00:01:00.980 align:middle line:84%
and I started to really seek my
self-worth outside of myself.

By the time I was 25 years
old, I was severely addicted

00:01:09.400 --> 00:01:12.280 align:middle line:84%
to drugs and alcohol,
to relationships,

00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:16.300 align:middle line:84%
very co-dependent, and I hit
that big bottom, that life

00:01:16.300 --> 00:01:20.320 align:middle line:84%
bottom that was the greatest
blessing of my life, which

00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:22.272 align:middle line:84%
was that moment where
I recognize there has

00:01:22.272 --> 00:01:23.480 align:middle line:90%

Kundalini is the
yoga of awareness.

00:01:58.810 --> 00:02:02.440 align:middle line:84%
It's a practice of really
elevating your dormant energy.

00:02:02.440 --> 00:02:08.880 align:middle line:90%


00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:11.997 align:middle line:84%
But the Kundalini energy sits
at the base of our spine,

00:02:11.997 --> 00:02:13.580 align:middle line:84%
and through the
practice of Kundalini,

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:18.500 align:middle line:84%
we can raise that energy up so
we can have stronger intuition.

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:21.050 align:middle line:84%
It's all about really
raising our vitality

00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:24.240 align:middle line:84%
and opening our
heart in a major way.

So when we're repeating
mantras or we're

00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:55.050 align:middle line:84%
moving our hands
in a specific way,

00:02:55.050 --> 00:02:58.470 align:middle line:84%
we're allowing ourselves
to get into the meditation.

00:02:58.470 --> 00:03:02.250 align:middle line:84%
We can allow ourselves to lose
our fears in that meditation,

00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:04.920 align:middle line:84%
lose our anxieties
in that meditation,

00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:10.830 align:middle line:84%
and we can go into a space where
we're actually flowing with it

00:03:10.830 --> 00:03:12.690 align:middle line:90%
rather than moving against it.

00:03:12.690 --> 00:03:18.760 align:middle line:90%


00:03:18.760 --> 00:03:21.800 align:middle line:84%
I think that the more I have
expanded my inner awareness

00:03:21.800 --> 00:03:24.830 align:middle line:90%
and the longer I can be still--

00:03:24.830 --> 00:03:30.470 align:middle line:84%
not even length of time, just
having the desire to be still--

00:03:30.470 --> 00:03:34.730 align:middle line:84%
helps me tap into listening
to what needs to come through

00:03:34.730 --> 00:03:36.920 align:middle line:84%
rather than thinking about
what needs to be said.

00:03:36.920 --> 00:03:42.390 align:middle line:90%


00:03:42.390 --> 00:03:47.487 align:middle line:84%
That silence allows you to be a
greater messenger for the work

00:03:47.487 --> 00:03:48.570 align:middle line:90%
that you're here to share.

00:03:48.570 --> 00:04:00.270 align:middle line:90%


00:04:00.270 --> 00:04:05.190 align:middle line:84%
I suffer from still just sort
of addiction in other forms--

00:04:05.190 --> 00:04:07.250 align:middle line:84%
so now maybe just
addiction to the internet

00:04:07.250 --> 00:04:11.460 align:middle line:84%
or whatever pops
up and creeps up.

00:04:11.460 --> 00:04:14.490 align:middle line:84%
The automatic response
is to turn to the food

00:04:14.490 --> 00:04:18.660 align:middle line:84%
or turn to the drugs or turn
to the work or roll out of bed

00:04:18.660 --> 00:04:21.000 align:middle line:84%
and just check your email
rather than roll out of bed

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:21.800 align:middle line:90%
and breathe.

00:04:21.800 --> 00:04:25.437 align:middle line:90%


00:04:25.437 --> 00:04:27.270 align:middle line:84%
That's why the commitment
and the discipline

00:04:27.270 --> 00:04:28.990 align:middle line:90%
is really important to me.

00:04:28.990 --> 00:04:31.590 align:middle line:84%
I require discipline in
order to stay on path.

We've spent most of our
lives forgetting, unlearning,

unlearning the
love that we were,

and the real work
that we have to do

00:05:08.350 --> 00:05:10.517 align:middle line:84%
is unlearn the fear that
we've chosen to believe in.

philosophy, one third, one

third, one third, that when
we would come to this time

00:05:19.010 --> 00:05:21.500 align:middle line:84%
that we are now known
as the Aquarian Age,

00:05:21.500 --> 00:05:23.650 align:middle line:84%
we would be living
in this time of chaos

go mad, one third will die,

00:05:37.570 --> 00:05:39.550 align:middle line:90%
and one third will wake up.

generation, my question

00:05:42.740 --> 00:05:44.690 align:middle line:84%
is, which one third
would you like to be?
