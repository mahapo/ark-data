I practice is to heal.

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:41.817 align:middle line:84%
I had wanted to go maybe do some
therapy, but couldn't afford it

00:00:41.817 --> 00:00:44.400 align:middle line:84%
and I didn't have enough money
to sort of sit and tell someone

00:00:44.400 --> 00:00:46.970 align:middle line:84%
all of my troubles and
all of my problems.

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:50.835 align:middle line:84%
And I realized there's another

You know, I've been a drinker,

all this stuff.

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:03.440 align:middle line:84%
Nothing has given me the peace
that meditation has given me.

00:01:03.440 --> 00:01:07.820 align:middle line:84%
It allowed me now to go, oh,
all that's still out there.

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:10.730 align:middle line:84%
I could do all that
to kill my pain again,

00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:12.590 align:middle line:84%
but I've already
done that dance.

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:13.820 align:middle line:90%

00:01:20.365 --> 00:01:22.240 align:middle line:84%
I had to learn the hard
way, and go bankrupt,

00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:26.020 align:middle line:84%
and be poor, and be broke, and
hold onto my little food stamp

when I was seven years old.

00:01:29.350 --> 00:01:32.800 align:middle line:84%
I had to begin to sever my
connection to a consciousness

00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:34.210 align:middle line:90%
that was poverty-stricken.

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:44.650 align:middle line:84%
So now, I just try to go,
when I get antsy, sit down.

00:01:44.650 --> 00:01:45.450 align:middle line:90%
Just sit down.

itself out that way.

So how do I develop the ability
to slow my computer down so

00:02:21.130 --> 00:02:22.810 align:middle line:90%
I have peace?

00:02:22.810 --> 00:02:23.890 align:middle line:90%

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:35.460 align:middle line:84%
The only way for

Even if I can't completely
let go of all my thoughts,

if I could observe
them going by,

00:02:59.800 --> 00:03:02.500 align:middle line:84%
and have a little giggle
about them, and release them,

00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:04.900 align:middle line:84%
then I feel like I'm getting
closer to my true presence.

00:03:07.485 --> 00:03:08.860 align:middle line:84%
I could sit in

on a beach for hours.

00:03:12.240 --> 00:03:16.920 align:middle line:84%

I sort of feel more connected.

tonight and be this other guy.

himself so fully into his work

can soak up all that ego.

And there's the Giancarlo
who is the yogi, who

who practices the physical yoga

open because I completely

I would go off to the side
and sit, and close my eyes,

00:04:46.510 --> 00:04:48.700 align:middle line:10%
and stare at my nose,
and listen to my breath

00:04:55.360 --> 00:05:00.990 align:middle line:84%
And then I wanted to
add just the quiet peace

00:05:00.990 --> 00:05:03.820 align:middle line:90%
to that observance of people.

00:05:03.820 --> 00:05:12.500 align:middle line:84%

to access focus and intention,

I think what I'm realizing
is I'm perfect just as I am.

And there's nothing
I need to do.

really great calm.
