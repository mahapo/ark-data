>> Close your eyes.

00:00:23.190 --> 00:00:29.850 align:middle line:90%
And in moments, you're diving.

00:00:29.850 --> 00:00:30.795 align:middle line:90%
You're diving within.

00:00:30.795 --> 00:00:33.300 align:middle line:90%


00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:35.970 align:middle line:90%
It's like soft electricity.

00:00:39.880 --> 00:00:44.910 align:middle line:84%
The whole thing opens up
to an unbounded feeling.

00:01:02.620 --> 00:01:07.820 align:middle line:84%
Before I started meditating,
I heard the word meditation,

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:10.420 align:middle line:84%
and it meant almost
nothing to me.

00:01:10.420 --> 00:01:13.240 align:middle line:90%


00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:22.030 align:middle line:84%
It seemed like a fad, and a
waste of time, and not for me.

00:01:22.030 --> 00:01:24.640 align:middle line:84%
Being an artist, I
felt like maybe it's

00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:27.010 align:middle line:84%
going to fiddle
with my creativity.

00:01:27.010 --> 00:01:28.900 align:middle line:84%
Maybe this thing
is going to make

00:01:28.900 --> 00:01:31.975 align:middle line:84%
me want to just stop working
and sit under a tree.

00:01:31.975 --> 00:01:36.480 align:middle line:90%


00:01:36.480 --> 00:01:39.630 align:middle line:84%
I was accepted to the
American Film Institute.

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:43.020 align:middle line:84%
And I was given an opportunity
to make my first feature.

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:45.380 align:middle line:90%
I was given money.

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:51.520 align:middle line:84%
I had all the equipment I
could dream of given to me.

00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:55.180 align:middle line:84%
At this point, I remember
standing and looking

00:01:55.180 --> 00:01:58.270 align:middle line:84%
at this wall
thinking I should be

00:01:58.270 --> 00:02:01.150 align:middle line:90%
the happiest person on Earth.

00:02:01.150 --> 00:02:02.890 align:middle line:90%
But I looked inside.

00:02:02.890 --> 00:02:07.155 align:middle line:84%
And the happiness was just
a dance on the surface.

00:02:07.155 --> 00:02:10.970 align:middle line:90%


00:02:10.970 --> 00:02:13.410 align:middle line:90%
Below-- hollow.

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:21.700 align:middle line:90%
I said, whoa.

00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:25.240 align:middle line:90%
No inner happiness.

00:02:25.240 --> 00:02:27.335 align:middle line:84%
Looking back, I felt
I had a weakness.

00:02:27.335 --> 00:02:30.430 align:middle line:90%


00:02:30.430 --> 00:02:32.080 align:middle line:90%
I wasn't self-assured.

00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:36.790 align:middle line:84%
Even though I had great
desires and ideas,

00:02:36.790 --> 00:02:41.690 align:middle line:84%
I had anxieties like
crazy like everybody.

00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:47.060 align:middle line:84%
I had a kind of a tremendous
anger toward my first wife.

00:02:47.060 --> 00:02:50.180 align:middle line:84%
I wasn't dealing
with a full deck.

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:54.000 align:middle line:90%


00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:58.890 align:middle line:84%
There's a thing in people where
for one reason or another,

00:02:58.890 --> 00:03:01.770 align:middle line:90%
suddenly they become a seeker.

00:03:01.770 --> 00:03:04.050 align:middle line:90%
They just become a seeker.

00:03:04.050 --> 00:03:06.090 align:middle line:84%
Somewhere along
the line, I heard

00:03:06.090 --> 00:03:09.570 align:middle line:84%
this phrase true happiness
is not out there.

00:03:09.570 --> 00:03:12.480 align:middle line:90%
True happiness lies within.

00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:16.950 align:middle line:84%
And this phrase had a
ring of truth to it.

00:03:16.950 --> 00:03:21.120 align:middle line:84%
But the phrase doesn't tell you
where the within is, nor does

00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:22.470 align:middle line:90%
it tell you how to get there.

00:03:22.470 --> 00:03:28.530 align:middle line:90%


00:03:28.530 --> 00:03:32.790 align:middle line:84%
You need a key that opens
the door to that treasury.

00:03:32.790 --> 00:03:34.680 align:middle line:90%
That's the trick.

00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:35.485 align:middle line:90%
That's the trick.

00:03:35.485 --> 00:03:45.020 align:middle line:90%


00:03:45.020 --> 00:03:46.190 align:middle line:90%
I might draw you a picture.

00:03:46.190 --> 00:03:49.190 align:middle line:90%


00:03:49.190 --> 00:03:53.255 align:middle line:84%
This line here we'll say
represents surface of life.

00:03:53.255 --> 00:03:56.880 align:middle line:90%


00:03:56.880 --> 00:03:58.115 align:middle line:90%
And this here is matter.

00:03:58.115 --> 00:04:01.290 align:middle line:90%


00:04:01.290 --> 00:04:04.010 align:middle line:90%
And this is mind--

00:04:04.010 --> 00:04:06.960 align:middle line:90%
mind and matter.

00:04:06.960 --> 00:04:09.980 align:middle line:84%
They say scientists about
200 or 300 years ago started

00:04:09.980 --> 00:04:11.870 align:middle line:90%
wondering what was this matter?

00:04:11.870 --> 00:04:15.170 align:middle line:90%
What was it really?

00:04:15.170 --> 00:04:18.329 align:middle line:84%
And they started
delving into matter.

00:04:18.329 --> 00:04:21.140 align:middle line:84%
And in about the
1970s, quantum physics

00:04:21.140 --> 00:04:31.580 align:middle line:84%
discovered the unified field,
the unity of all the particles

00:04:31.580 --> 00:04:34.460 align:middle line:84%
and all the forces
of manifestation

00:04:34.460 --> 00:04:40.610 align:middle line:90%
of creation, unity, oneness.

00:04:40.610 --> 00:04:45.410 align:middle line:84%
Everything that is a thing,
including frogs, fish,

00:04:45.410 --> 00:04:50.550 align:middle line:84%
babbling brooks, sun, stars,
galaxies, the whole universe,

00:04:50.550 --> 00:04:54.380 align:middle line:84%
super structures, and all those
little elementary particles

00:04:54.380 --> 00:04:55.675 align:middle line:90%
has emerged from this field.

00:04:55.675 --> 00:04:59.460 align:middle line:90%


00:04:59.460 --> 00:05:04.055 align:middle line:84%
The experience of this field is
what's missing in today's life.

00:05:04.055 --> 00:05:10.120 align:middle line:90%

00:05:13.010 --> 00:05:19.970 align:middle line:84%
I thought maybe this
thing of meditation

00:05:19.970 --> 00:05:21.105 align:middle line:90%
is a way to go within.

00:05:21.105 --> 00:05:26.670 align:middle line:90%


00:05:26.670 --> 00:05:29.670 align:middle line:84%
I had doubts at the
same time, I felt

00:05:29.670 --> 00:05:32.590 align:middle line:84%
there was something
truthful about it.

00:05:32.590 --> 00:05:34.920 align:middle line:90%
And I wanted it.

00:05:34.920 --> 00:05:41.070 align:middle line:84%
And I went and I learned on
July 1, 1973, about 11:30

00:05:41.070 --> 00:05:43.430 align:middle line:84%
on a Saturday, beautiful
sunny Saturday morning.

00:05:43.430 --> 00:05:46.590 align:middle line:90%


00:05:46.590 --> 00:05:49.530 align:middle line:84%
Within the first
two weeks, I started

00:05:49.530 --> 00:05:56.040 align:middle line:84%
getting happier within the work,
more happiness in the doing.

00:05:56.040 --> 00:05:59.260 align:middle line:90%
Ideas seem to come more easily.

00:05:59.260 --> 00:06:01.590 align:middle line:90%
This anger kind of went away.

00:06:01.590 --> 00:06:04.195 align:middle line:90%
I got a feeling of more freedom.

00:06:04.195 --> 00:06:08.690 align:middle line:90%


00:06:08.690 --> 00:06:11.435 align:middle line:84%
And it felt very,
very good to be alive.

00:06:11.435 --> 00:06:14.240 align:middle line:90%


00:06:14.240 --> 00:06:16.650 align:middle line:84%
A bigger picture of
life started emerging.

00:06:16.650 --> 00:06:28.600 align:middle line:90%


00:06:28.600 --> 00:06:31.450 align:middle line:84%
Transcendental
meditation opens the door

00:06:31.450 --> 00:06:33.850 align:middle line:84%
to this deepest level
of life, this treasury.

00:06:40.880 --> 00:06:43.550 align:middle line:84%
In transcendental meditation,
you're given a mantra--

00:06:43.550 --> 00:06:46.480 align:middle line:90%


00:06:46.480 --> 00:06:49.570 align:middle line:84%
the very specific
sound vibration

00:06:49.570 --> 00:06:53.080 align:middle line:84%
thought designed to
turn the awareness

00:06:53.080 --> 00:06:57.835 align:middle line:90%
from out 180 degrees to within.

00:06:57.835 --> 00:07:00.640 align:middle line:90%


00:07:00.640 --> 00:07:08.240 align:middle line:84%
Once you're pointed within,
you will naturally and easily

00:07:08.240 --> 00:07:21.690 align:middle line:84%
dive and experience this
unbounded, eternal, infinite,

00:07:21.690 --> 00:07:26.595 align:middle line:84%
immutable, immortal field of
consciousness, unity, oneness.

00:07:26.595 --> 00:07:30.100 align:middle line:90%


00:07:30.100 --> 00:07:34.200 align:middle line:84%
In Vedic terms this
field is called Atma,

00:07:34.200 --> 00:07:41.730 align:middle line:84%
meaning the Self
with a capital S.

00:07:41.730 --> 00:07:47.720 align:middle line:84%
Another is brahm,
meaning totality.

00:07:47.720 --> 00:07:49.910 align:middle line:90%
This Atma is brahm.

00:07:49.910 --> 00:07:53.060 align:middle line:90%
This Self is totality.

00:07:53.060 --> 00:07:54.420 align:middle line:90%
So beautiful.

00:07:54.420 --> 00:07:59.460 align:middle line:84%
This is our full potential
to live totality.

00:07:59.460 --> 00:08:07.370 align:middle line:90%


00:08:07.370 --> 00:08:17.230 align:middle line:84%
Stories throughout time
have conflict, and torment,

00:08:17.230 --> 00:08:19.990 align:middle line:90%
and struggles.

00:08:19.990 --> 00:08:23.350 align:middle line:84%
The artist doesn't have to
suffer to show suffering.

00:08:23.350 --> 00:08:26.290 align:middle line:84%
You have to
understand the thing.

Every human being has
consciousness, but not

00:08:38.390 --> 00:08:42.740 align:middle line:84%
every human being
has the same amount.

00:08:42.740 --> 00:08:47.180 align:middle line:84%
So if you have a ball of
consciousness this big,

00:08:47.180 --> 00:08:50.810 align:middle line:84%
and you start transcending
on a regular basis,

00:08:50.810 --> 00:08:54.320 align:middle line:84%
this ball of consciousness
will start expanding.

00:08:54.320 --> 00:08:58.920 align:middle line:84%
What you're doing is making
the subconscious now conscious.

00:08:58.920 --> 00:09:02.720 align:middle line:84%
You're unfolding the full
potential of the human being.

00:09:02.720 --> 00:09:07.280 align:middle line:84%
You're cleaning the machine
of stresses, anxieties,

00:09:07.280 --> 00:09:12.400 align:middle line:84%
depression, hate,
anger, rage, despair,

00:09:12.400 --> 00:09:16.865 align:middle line:84%

in more and more freedom.

garbage going out,

and those things that
used to stress you

00:09:29.910 --> 00:09:34.550 align:middle line:84%
don't have the
same power anymore.

00:09:34.550 --> 00:09:36.880 align:middle line:90%
This is magical.
