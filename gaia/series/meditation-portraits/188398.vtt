00:00:01.473 --> 00:00:03.928 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:03.928 --> 00:00:13.750 align:middle line:90%


00:00:13.750 --> 00:00:19.240 align:middle line:84%
>> I think for all of us there
is a closeness to ourselves

00:00:19.240 --> 00:00:20.860 align:middle line:90%
that we're longing for.

00:00:20.860 --> 00:00:36.380 align:middle line:90%


00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:39.910 align:middle line:90%
So I live in New York City.

00:00:39.910 --> 00:00:44.710 align:middle line:84%
We are sitting in my apartment
with my kid's toys everywhere

00:00:44.710 --> 00:00:48.730 align:middle line:84%
and my work things
everywhere, food and plants

00:00:48.730 --> 00:00:52.170 align:middle line:84%
and noise and cars,
and the whole city

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:54.010 align:middle line:90%
is happening around us.

00:00:54.010 --> 00:00:56.905 align:middle line:84%
We're two blocks away
from that big protest.

00:00:56.905 --> 00:01:00.803 align:middle line:90%


00:01:00.803 --> 00:01:02.220 align:middle line:10%
I didn't know
before I learned how

00:01:02.220 --> 00:01:04.959 align:middle line:10%
to just sit and
be still and watch

00:01:04.959 --> 00:01:08.820 align:middle line:10%
that all of the chaos and all
of the doubt and all of the fear

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:15.540 align:middle line:10%
is actually exactly
the road to my freedom.

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:20.040 align:middle line:84%
You don't have to go to the
mountaintop to meditate.

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:23.370 align:middle line:84%
We should and could
do it right here.

00:01:23.370 --> 00:01:27.160 align:middle line:84%
This is where we figure out
exactly how much power we have.

00:01:27.160 --> 00:01:31.580 align:middle line:90%


00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:36.440 align:middle line:84%
I started trying to
meditate in 1998 when

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:38.420 align:middle line:90%
I was training to be a teacher.

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:44.330 align:middle line:84%
And my teacher was a
Tibetan Buddhist teacher,

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:49.700 align:middle line:84%
and that's how the practice
of meditation began for me.

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:57.400 align:middle line:84%
I really struggled for a
really long time to sit at all.

00:01:57.400 --> 00:02:02.550 align:middle line:90%


00:02:02.550 --> 00:02:06.770 align:middle line:84%
And around 2000, 2001,
I met another teacher

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:10.460 align:middle line:84%
who taught me that five
minutes a day is all I need.

00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:12.200 align:middle line:84%
Just do five minutes,
dead or alive,

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:13.325 align:middle line:90%
first thing in the morning.

00:02:13.325 --> 00:02:16.300 align:middle line:90%


00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:18.788 align:middle line:84%
To sit and be quiet
for five minutes

00:02:18.788 --> 00:02:20.830 align:middle line:84%
and just watch my breathing
and listen to the way

00:02:20.830 --> 00:02:24.210 align:middle line:84%
it reached all these
different parts of my body

00:02:24.210 --> 00:02:25.870 align:middle line:90%
was a big effort for me.

00:02:25.870 --> 00:02:28.840 align:middle line:90%


00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:34.590 align:middle line:84%
There is now a need
for it in my life.

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:37.590 align:middle line:84%
As much as I need to brush
my teeth, I need to sit,

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:43.560 align:middle line:84%
because if I don't sit,
I feel static inside.

00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:44.910 align:middle line:90%
I feel sharper.

00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:51.090 align:middle line:84%
I feel less a master
of my experience.

00:02:51.090 --> 00:02:56.900 align:middle line:90%


00:02:56.900 --> 00:03:02.300 align:middle line:84%
In the practices of yoga and
particularly in meditation,

00:03:02.300 --> 00:03:04.910 align:middle line:90%
it's you and you.

00:03:04.910 --> 00:03:07.380 align:middle line:90%
There's nobody else there.

00:03:07.380 --> 00:03:09.030 align:middle line:84%
And the hilarious
paradox is that we're

00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:12.000 align:middle line:84%
tuning in to
ourselves, and that's

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:14.550 align:middle line:84%
exactly the thing that helps
us listen to other people.

00:03:14.550 --> 00:03:23.050 align:middle line:90%


00:03:23.050 --> 00:03:25.800 align:middle line:84%
One of the most important
aspects of my job,

00:03:25.800 --> 00:03:29.460 align:middle line:84%
I feel, as a teacher is to make
sure that everybody's aware

00:03:29.460 --> 00:03:34.725 align:middle line:84%
that everything that they do is
having an impact on all of us.

00:03:34.725 --> 00:03:42.370 align:middle line:90%


00:03:42.370 --> 00:03:44.800 align:middle line:84%
Every thought that I
have is impacting you.

00:03:44.800 --> 00:03:47.290 align:middle line:84%
Every thought that you
have is impacting me.

00:03:47.290 --> 00:03:49.840 align:middle line:84%
Every move that I make
is impacting and rippling

00:03:49.840 --> 00:03:53.300 align:middle line:90%
into everything around me.

00:03:53.300 --> 00:03:55.490 align:middle line:84%
We're all having these
little resonances

00:03:55.490 --> 00:03:58.160 align:middle line:90%
with each other all the time.

00:03:58.160 --> 00:04:00.260 align:middle line:84%
For more of us to
be meditating is

00:04:00.260 --> 00:04:04.618 align:middle line:84%
to refine that resonance
so that when we share space

00:04:04.618 --> 00:04:06.410 align:middle line:84%
with another person,
when we share thoughts

00:04:06.410 --> 00:04:10.250 align:middle line:84%
with another person, when we
share love with another person,

00:04:10.250 --> 00:04:16.250 align:middle line:84%
there is not only a clarity, but
a directionality to what we're

00:04:16.250 --> 00:04:18.279 align:middle line:90%
doing.

00:04:18.279 --> 00:04:19.370 align:middle line:90%
There's a purpose.

00:04:19.370 --> 00:04:20.950 align:middle line:90%
There's a mission.

00:04:20.950 --> 00:04:24.970 align:middle line:84%
There's-- this word keeps coming
up, but there's an elegance.

00:04:24.970 --> 00:04:27.700 align:middle line:84%
Like, I longed
for that as a kid.

00:04:27.700 --> 00:04:30.580 align:middle line:84%
I longed for that
even into my 20's.

00:04:30.580 --> 00:04:32.890 align:middle line:84%
I just want to-- can I
please just be elegant?

00:04:32.890 --> 00:04:33.690 align:middle line:90%
Why?

00:04:33.690 --> 00:04:35.380 align:middle line:84%
I just-- I know
what it looks like.

00:04:35.380 --> 00:04:39.000 align:middle line:84%
I recognize it in other
people, men and women.

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:40.810 align:middle line:84%
Why can't I just
find that in myself?

00:04:40.810 --> 00:04:43.660 align:middle line:90%


00:04:43.660 --> 00:04:50.220 align:middle line:84%
For all of us to go
deeper into that practice

00:04:50.220 --> 00:04:55.800 align:middle line:84%
is to refine our
contributions on the earth in,

00:04:55.800 --> 00:04:56.760 align:middle line:90%
our emanations.

00:04:56.760 --> 00:05:05.290 align:middle line:90%


00:05:05.290 --> 00:05:08.410 align:middle line:84%
I just want to make sure that
I'm grateful for everything

00:05:08.410 --> 00:05:13.230 align:middle line:84%
so that I can keep
perpetuating what is amazing

00:05:13.230 --> 00:05:18.880 align:middle line:84%
and what isn't can
just slowly fade.

00:05:18.880 --> 00:06:08.000 align:middle line:90%
