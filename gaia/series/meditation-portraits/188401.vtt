>> The first Buddhist text
that I ever read says,

00:00:19.360 --> 00:00:22.490 align:middle line:84%
look to your mind, wise
man, look to it well.

00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:25.790 align:middle line:84%
It is subtle, invisible,
and treacherous.

00:00:25.790 --> 00:00:31.780 align:middle line:90%


00:00:31.780 --> 00:00:33.770 align:middle line:84%
I really related
to the treacherous.

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:36.510 align:middle line:84%
I mean, the whole thing, subtle
and invisible, but treacherous.

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:42.900 align:middle line:90%


00:00:42.900 --> 00:00:45.720 align:middle line:84%
My name is Mark Epstein,
and I'm a psychiatrist

00:00:45.720 --> 00:00:48.970 align:middle line:84%
and a writer about Buddhism
and psychoanalysis.

00:00:48.970 --> 00:00:52.530 align:middle line:90%


00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:56.310 align:middle line:84%
I started doing meditation
retreats when I was 21 or so

00:00:56.310 --> 00:00:58.730 align:middle line:84%
and then started
writing about it.

00:00:58.730 --> 00:01:00.480 align:middle line:84%
So it's been a part
of my life ever since.

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:11.220 align:middle line:90%


00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:14.320 align:middle line:84%
When I was still in
college, I looked

00:01:14.320 --> 00:01:16.660 align:middle line:84%
to both Buddhism
and psychotherapy

00:01:16.660 --> 00:01:20.010 align:middle line:90%
to try to find some relief.

00:01:20.010 --> 00:01:22.350 align:middle line:84%
My first therapist
told me, you're

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:24.840 align:middle line:84%
just suffering from what
we call an Oedipus Complex.

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:27.690 align:middle line:84%
And you should feel better
once you realize that.

00:01:27.690 --> 00:01:30.240 align:middle line:84%
And the language
helped me, but it

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:37.380 align:middle line:84%
didn't give me an experience of
relief that I was looking for.

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:41.340 align:middle line:84%
I went straight from there
to the Buddhist world.

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:44.430 align:middle line:84%
And the first Buddhist
teachers that I met basically

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:47.730 align:middle line:90%
told me, learn how to feel.

00:01:47.730 --> 00:01:51.330 align:middle line:84%
I had to sit back
into myself and start

00:01:51.330 --> 00:01:54.330 align:middle line:84%
to feel the texture
of my own experience.

00:01:54.330 --> 00:01:57.410 align:middle line:90%


00:01:57.410 --> 00:02:00.920 align:middle line:84%
Relaxing into that is
what I sometimes call

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:02.780 align:middle line:90%
the formless art of meditation.

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:12.460 align:middle line:90%

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:25.230 align:middle line:84%
After graduate school, I
would listen to public radio

00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:27.150 align:middle line:90%
while I was working.

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:31.080 align:middle line:90%
And they had Alan Watts tapes.

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:32.910 align:middle line:84%
Sort of perked
something up in me

00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:38.155 align:middle line:84%
that I started to think of as
very aligned with art making.

00:02:38.155 --> 00:02:40.530 align:middle line:84%
>> You can look at something
with a microscope and see it

00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:41.620 align:middle line:90%
a certain way.

00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:43.110 align:middle line:84%
You can look at it
with a naked eye

00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:44.610 align:middle line:90%
and see it in a certain way.

00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:46.193 align:middle line:84%
You could look at
it with a telescope,

00:02:46.193 --> 00:02:49.070 align:middle line:90%
and you'd see it in another way.

00:02:49.070 --> 00:02:52.890 align:middle line:84%
>> The drone of his voice
and the strangeness of his

00:02:52.890 --> 00:02:57.060 align:middle line:90%
metaphors was attractive to me.

00:02:57.060 --> 00:03:00.410 align:middle line:84%
>> Some human beings have
slipped somehow or other

00:03:00.410 --> 00:03:04.590 align:middle line:84%
into states of consciousness
where they see the apparent

00:03:04.590 --> 00:03:07.620 align:middle line:84%
disintegration and
disorganization of everyday

00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:10.890 align:middle line:90%
life as completely harmonious.

00:03:10.890 --> 00:03:15.720 align:middle line:84%
>> The notion of being in the
zone or a creative state was

00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:19.380 align:middle line:84%
very much the kind of meditative
consciousness that he was

00:03:19.380 --> 00:03:20.180 align:middle line:90%
talking about.

00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:24.900 align:middle line:90%


00:03:24.900 --> 00:03:27.330 align:middle line:84%
I don't think meditation
is about stillness.

00:03:27.330 --> 00:03:32.000 align:middle line:90%


00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:40.500 align:middle line:84%
A spiritual practice has to do
with awareness and attention

00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:43.560 align:middle line:90%
and sensitivity to being alive.

00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:49.200 align:middle line:84%
And to those things,
those qualities

00:03:49.200 --> 00:03:57.080 align:middle line:84%
of aliveness and everything,
I use awareness in the studio.

00:03:57.080 --> 00:04:00.620 align:middle line:84%
And I want to be bringing
that aliveness into the work.

00:04:00.620 --> 00:04:04.340 align:middle line:84%
And I want to be paying
attention in the studio

00:04:04.340 --> 00:04:05.664 align:middle line:90%
to what's happening.

00:04:05.664 --> 00:04:12.450 align:middle line:90%


00:04:12.450 --> 00:04:16.500 align:middle line:84%
>> There's a text about
mindfulness that when I was

00:04:16.500 --> 00:04:19.210 align:middle line:84%
on one of these retreats, the
phrase came to me when I was

00:04:19.210 --> 00:04:20.010 align:middle line:90%
sitting.

00:04:20.010 --> 00:04:24.060 align:middle line:84%
Something like the monk sits
down cross-legged and places

00:04:24.060 --> 00:04:25.740 align:middle line:90%
his mindfulness before him.

00:04:25.740 --> 00:04:34.230 align:middle line:90%


00:04:34.230 --> 00:04:36.940 align:middle line:84%
>> There was one time when Mark
went on a meditation retreat

00:04:36.940 --> 00:04:42.660 align:middle line:84%
that both kids got chicken
pox at the same time,

00:04:42.660 --> 00:04:43.560 align:middle line:90%
and I was alone.

00:04:43.560 --> 00:04:46.398 align:middle line:84%
So that was sort of a
memorable experience.

00:04:46.398 --> 00:04:47.440 align:middle line:90%
>> I don't remember that.

00:04:47.440 --> 00:04:48.450 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:04:48.450 --> 00:04:50.553 align:middle line:90%
We're married.

00:04:50.553 --> 00:04:51.970 align:middle line:84%
>> How long have
you been married?

00:04:51.970 --> 00:04:53.570 align:middle line:90%
>> 30 years.

00:04:53.570 --> 00:04:56.190 align:middle line:90%
>> 30-- no, 31.

00:04:56.190 --> 00:04:57.060 align:middle line:90%
31.

00:04:57.060 --> 00:04:58.134 align:middle line:90%
>> And counting.

00:04:58.134 --> 00:04:59.790 align:middle line:90%
>> Mhm.

00:04:59.790 --> 00:05:03.040 align:middle line:84%
>> It wasn't either of our
first major relationships.

00:05:03.040 --> 00:05:05.670 align:middle line:84%
And one of the things that
we always talked about

00:05:05.670 --> 00:05:08.910 align:middle line:84%
was that we needed
the separate time,

00:05:08.910 --> 00:05:11.400 align:middle line:90%
but also the together time.

00:05:11.400 --> 00:05:13.952 align:middle line:90%
>> He didn't actually get--

00:05:13.952 --> 00:05:14.910 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, what that was.

00:05:14.910 --> 00:05:23.280 align:middle line:84%
>> How much time, how much
time and effort that I required

00:05:23.280 --> 00:05:24.670 align:middle line:90%
in that forum.

00:05:24.670 --> 00:05:26.670 align:middle line:84%
Because when we first got
together, he was like,

00:05:26.670 --> 00:05:27.750 align:middle line:90%
where are you going.

00:05:27.750 --> 00:05:30.700 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, that's when
I started writing.

00:05:30.700 --> 00:05:31.500 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:05:31.500 --> 00:05:34.320 align:middle line:84%
>> I started writing when
Arlene went to her studio.

00:05:34.320 --> 00:05:36.630 align:middle line:84%
Because I was just assuming
we'd be together, you know?

00:05:36.630 --> 00:05:37.630 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, you were like, what?

00:05:37.630 --> 00:05:38.500 align:middle line:90%
Where are you going?

00:05:38.500 --> 00:05:40.770 align:middle line:90%
I said, studio.

00:05:40.770 --> 00:05:43.365 align:middle line:90%
So it was a little bumpy there.

00:05:43.365 --> 00:05:46.772 align:middle line:90%


00:05:46.772 --> 00:05:48.480 align:middle line:84%
>> I never thought of
myself as a writer.

00:05:48.480 --> 00:05:49.320 align:middle line:90%
It surprised me.

00:05:49.320 --> 00:05:54.420 align:middle line:90%


00:05:54.420 --> 00:05:59.100 align:middle line:84%
My latest book is called "The
Trauma of Everyday Life".

00:05:59.100 --> 00:06:00.480 align:middle line:84%
What I realized
is that we're all

00:06:00.480 --> 00:06:04.110 align:middle line:84%
going to experience the
trauma of our own deaths

00:06:04.110 --> 00:06:08.160 align:middle line:84%
or the deaths of the people
that we love the most.

00:06:08.160 --> 00:06:11.250 align:middle line:84%
If we're not suffering
from post-traumatic stress,

00:06:11.250 --> 00:06:13.320 align:middle line:84%
we're suffering from
pre-traumatic stress.

00:06:13.320 --> 00:06:16.540 align:middle line:90%
And we sense that.

00:06:16.540 --> 00:06:19.420 align:middle line:84%
That's part of the shaky
ground of everyday life.

00:06:19.420 --> 00:06:23.750 align:middle line:90%


00:06:23.750 --> 00:06:26.990 align:middle line:84%
From the Buddhist point of
view, the way out is through.

00:06:26.990 --> 00:06:29.540 align:middle line:84%
That by facing those
most difficult feelings,

00:06:29.540 --> 00:06:31.710 align:middle line:84%
we actually can find
some relief from them.

00:06:31.710 --> 00:06:38.540 align:middle line:90%


00:06:38.540 --> 00:06:41.450 align:middle line:84%
There comes a point, I
found, with meditation

00:06:41.450 --> 00:06:45.650 align:middle line:84%
where you have to really take
it inside and make it your own.

00:06:45.650 --> 00:06:49.910 align:middle line:84%
And that's about
figuring out how

00:06:49.910 --> 00:06:53.780 align:middle line:84%
to let yourself present
itself to your mind.

00:06:53.780 --> 00:06:56.920 align:middle line:90%


00:06:56.920 --> 00:06:59.560 align:middle line:84%
Get who you think you
are out of the way

00:06:59.560 --> 00:07:03.325 align:middle line:84%
so that what you don't
know can begin to surface.

00:07:03.325 --> 00:07:20.670 align:middle line:90%


00:07:20.670 --> 00:07:23.210 align:middle line:10%
>> I make decisions about
how I'm going to work,

00:07:23.210 --> 00:07:26.300 align:middle line:10%
what I'm going to work
with, and ultimately, then,

00:07:26.300 --> 00:07:31.910 align:middle line:10%
what is made based on not
predetermining what I'm going

00:07:31.910 --> 00:07:35.550 align:middle line:10%
to create before I
actually make the thing.

00:07:35.550 --> 00:07:38.660 align:middle line:10%
So I choose materials
based on how

00:07:38.660 --> 00:07:42.260 align:middle line:10%
they respond to me,
to the moment, body

00:07:42.260 --> 00:07:44.090 align:middle line:10%
to body, right then and there.

00:07:44.090 --> 00:07:47.580 align:middle line:90%


00:07:47.580 --> 00:07:50.080 align:middle line:84%
When I first started
thinking like this,

00:07:50.080 --> 00:07:53.550 align:middle line:84%
I was using hydracal,
a combination

00:07:53.550 --> 00:07:55.530 align:middle line:90%
of cement and plaster.

00:07:55.530 --> 00:07:59.260 align:middle line:84%
And that material,
within 5 to 10 minutes,

00:07:59.260 --> 00:08:01.980 align:middle line:84%
it is transformed
from something that

00:08:01.980 --> 00:08:06.960 align:middle line:84%
is a liquid to something
that is completely hard.

00:08:06.960 --> 00:08:10.965 align:middle line:84%
So it was like working against
time with time using time.

00:08:10.965 --> 00:08:16.800 align:middle line:90%


00:08:16.800 --> 00:08:20.040 align:middle line:84%
That was probably my
first Buddhist version

00:08:20.040 --> 00:08:22.315 align:middle line:84%
of what it could be like
to be in the studio.

00:08:22.315 --> 00:08:31.600 align:middle line:90%


00:08:31.600 --> 00:08:34.600 align:middle line:84%
>> I've learned from being
married to an artist there was

00:08:34.600 --> 00:08:39.400 align:middle line:84%
a process of making art which
is akin to the process of making

00:08:39.400 --> 00:08:42.669 align:middle line:84%
meditation where you have
to be both the maker,

00:08:42.669 --> 00:08:46.280 align:middle line:84%
but also you have to be able to
lose yourself in the thing that

00:08:46.280 --> 00:08:47.080 align:middle line:90%
you are making.

00:08:47.080 --> 00:08:51.830 align:middle line:90%


00:08:51.830 --> 00:08:56.840 align:middle line:84%
>> One day I was working, and I
made this lump that most people

00:08:56.840 --> 00:08:59.390 align:middle line:90%
would not identify as a Buddha.

00:08:59.390 --> 00:09:05.300 align:middle line:84%
But I realized I was already
thinking about this time issue,

00:09:05.300 --> 00:09:09.800 align:middle line:84%
and that it had in
fact made me see

00:09:09.800 --> 00:09:13.610 align:middle line:90%
this lump as something iconic.

00:09:13.610 --> 00:09:18.200 align:middle line:84%
And to have the
Buddha around was

00:09:18.200 --> 00:09:20.530 align:middle line:90%
reminding me to pay attention.

00:09:20.530 --> 00:09:25.010 align:middle line:10%
And not thinking about it
as anything but practice,

00:09:25.010 --> 00:09:33.380 align:middle line:10%
I grew the next two years this
family of Buddhas that I felt,

00:09:33.380 --> 00:09:36.425 align:middle line:10%
in fact, became art,
but also something else.

00:09:36.425 --> 00:09:42.810 align:middle line:90%


00:09:42.810 --> 00:09:47.850 align:middle line:84%
We have two kids, a
27-year-old daughter and a son

00:09:47.850 --> 00:09:50.280 align:middle line:90%
who just turned 24 this week.

00:09:50.280 --> 00:09:53.010 align:middle line:90%
They're just spectacular.

00:09:53.010 --> 00:09:58.200 align:middle line:90%


00:09:58.200 --> 00:10:04.240 align:middle line:84%
We're all, I think,
pretty secure in wanting

00:10:04.240 --> 00:10:08.035 align:middle line:84%
to be in the family,
which is exciting.

00:10:08.035 --> 00:10:12.460 align:middle line:90%


00:10:12.460 --> 00:10:16.030 align:middle line:84%
Having kids has been a
complete and utter teaching

00:10:16.030 --> 00:10:22.120 align:middle line:84%
about things changing and
growing and transforming.

00:10:22.120 --> 00:10:26.440 align:middle line:84%
>> The core teaching of Buddhism
not to push away the unpleasant

00:10:26.440 --> 00:10:30.940 align:middle line:84%
and not to cling to the pleasant
let me see how family life was

00:10:30.940 --> 00:10:33.630 align:middle line:84%
a kind of extended
meditation retreat.

00:10:33.630 --> 00:10:35.710 align:middle line:84%
You know, like a 20
year meditation retreat.

00:10:35.710 --> 00:10:39.170 align:middle line:84%
That you needed the same
approach, which was whatever

00:10:39.170 --> 00:10:42.780 align:middle line:90%
comes I'm going to deal with.

00:10:42.780 --> 00:10:46.650 align:middle line:84%
>> Accepting that the
relationship is alive means

00:10:46.650 --> 00:10:51.030 align:middle line:84%
accepting that it's not
necessarily an easy thing.

00:10:51.030 --> 00:10:53.440 align:middle line:84%
>> The relationship
itself is always evolving.

00:10:53.440 --> 00:10:54.990 align:middle line:90%
It's always changing.

00:10:54.990 --> 00:10:57.600 align:middle line:84%
And to treat it as something
that has to be nourished,

00:10:57.600 --> 00:10:59.280 align:middle line:84%
that could never be
totally understood.

00:10:59.280 --> 00:11:02.250 align:middle line:84%
That whole way of approaching
the relationship for me

00:11:02.250 --> 00:11:03.810 align:middle line:90%
comes out of the Dharma.

00:11:03.810 --> 00:11:10.690 align:middle line:90%


00:11:10.690 --> 00:11:15.580 align:middle line:84%
>> We've had really strong
times and really, you know,

00:11:15.580 --> 00:11:17.920 align:middle line:90%
weak links.

00:11:17.920 --> 00:11:22.970 align:middle line:90%
But we've managed to pull it--

00:11:22.970 --> 00:11:25.730 align:middle line:90%
we're here right now.

00:11:25.730 --> 00:11:27.490 align:middle line:90%
I don't know what to say.

00:11:27.490 --> 00:11:28.990 align:middle line:90%
We're the--

00:11:28.990 --> 00:11:29.900 align:middle line:90%
>> Still ongoing.

00:11:29.900 --> 00:11:32.660 align:middle line:84%
>> We're for-- the
forum is ongoing.

00:11:32.660 --> 00:11:36.340 align:middle line:90%
We're inventing it as we speak.

00:11:36.340 --> 00:13:08.000 align:middle line:90%
