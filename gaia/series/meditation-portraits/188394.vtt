00:00:06.874 --> 00:00:09.820 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:09.820 --> 00:00:13.750 align:middle line:90%


00:00:13.750 --> 00:00:18.460 align:middle line:84%
>> Somebody said very rightly,
the purpose of our lives is

00:00:18.460 --> 00:00:19.650 align:middle line:90%
to help others through it.

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:30.890 align:middle line:90%


00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:32.890 align:middle line:84%
I'm a writer, and I'm
an environmentalist,

00:00:32.890 --> 00:00:34.250 align:middle line:90%
and I'm an activist.

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:37.090 align:middle line:84%
And I work for
American Indian people.

00:00:37.090 --> 00:00:39.125 align:middle line:84%
And I used to work
for Cesar Chavez.

00:00:39.125 --> 00:00:41.890 align:middle line:84%
And you know, I'm
kind of an old lefty.

00:00:41.890 --> 00:00:54.110 align:middle line:90%


00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:58.370 align:middle line:84%
As a kid, I was
very wild as a boy.

00:00:58.370 --> 00:01:01.880 align:middle line:84%
And in fact, my father felt
obliged to throw me out

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:04.610 align:middle line:90%
when I was 17.

00:01:04.610 --> 00:01:05.920 align:middle line:90%
And he was right.

00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:13.080 align:middle line:84%
He was right, and I was kind of
a, I don't know, an angry kid.

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:17.500 align:middle line:84%
And since then, I've
obviously modified my ways.

00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:20.090 align:middle line:84%
I've certainly patched
it up with him.

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:24.360 align:middle line:84%
We were good friends
by the time he died.

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:29.840 align:middle line:84%
But I was difficult.
I was very difficult.

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:32.990 align:middle line:84%
And my wives have found
me difficult, too.

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:50.230 align:middle line:90%


00:01:50.230 --> 00:01:53.650 align:middle line:84%
I've been a Zen
student for many years,

00:01:53.650 --> 00:02:00.550 align:middle line:84%
and really since
about 1969 or 70.

00:02:00.550 --> 00:02:02.300 align:middle line:84%
I've been looking for
a spiritual practice

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:03.785 align:middle line:90%
for quite a long time.

00:02:03.785 --> 00:02:31.550 align:middle line:90%


00:02:31.550 --> 00:02:34.380 align:middle line:84%
The search may begin
with a restless feeling

00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:36.870 align:middle line:90%
as if one were being watched.

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:40.890 align:middle line:84%
One turns in all directions
and sees nothing,

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:42.950 align:middle line:84%
yet one senses that
there is a source

00:02:42.950 --> 00:02:44.960 align:middle line:90%
for this deep restlessness.

00:02:44.960 --> 00:02:49.360 align:middle line:84%
And the path that leads there is
not a path to a strange place,

00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:50.690 align:middle line:90%
but the path home.

00:02:50.690 --> 00:02:55.780 align:middle line:90%


00:02:55.780 --> 00:02:58.420 align:middle line:84%
But you are home, cries
the witch of the north.

00:02:58.420 --> 00:03:02.100 align:middle line:90%
All you have to do is wake up.

00:03:02.100 --> 00:03:03.655 align:middle line:90%
The journey is hard.

00:03:03.655 --> 00:03:07.210 align:middle line:84%
But the secret place
where we have always been

00:03:07.210 --> 00:03:12.870 align:middle line:84%
is overgrown with thorns and
thickets of ideas, of fears,

00:03:12.870 --> 00:03:16.080 align:middle line:84%
and defenses, prejudices,
and repressions.

00:03:16.080 --> 00:03:19.710 align:middle line:90%


00:03:19.710 --> 00:03:21.820 align:middle line:84%
The holy grail is
what Zen Buddhists

00:03:21.820 --> 00:03:24.430 align:middle line:90%
call one's own true nature.

00:03:24.430 --> 00:03:28.770 align:middle line:90%


00:03:28.770 --> 00:03:32.130 align:middle line:84%
Each man is his own
savior after all.

00:03:32.130 --> 00:03:36.450 align:middle line:90%


00:03:36.450 --> 00:03:39.150 align:middle line:84%
Meditation has nothing
to do with contemplation

00:03:39.150 --> 00:03:42.810 align:middle line:84%
or eternal questions
or of one's own folly

00:03:42.810 --> 00:03:46.140 align:middle line:84%
or even of one's navel,
although a clearer view on all

00:03:46.140 --> 00:03:49.350 align:middle line:84%
of these enigmas may
result. It has nothing

00:03:49.350 --> 00:03:51.810 align:middle line:84%
to do with thought of
any kind, with anything

00:03:51.810 --> 00:03:56.340 align:middle line:84%
at all in fact but intuiting the
true nature of existence, which

00:03:56.340 --> 00:03:59.910 align:middle line:84%
is why it has appeared
in one form or another

00:03:59.910 --> 00:04:02.330 align:middle line:84%
in almost every
culture known to man.

00:04:02.330 --> 00:04:07.180 align:middle line:90%


00:04:07.180 --> 00:04:09.430 align:middle line:84%
We're all enlightened
beings in our true nature.

00:04:09.430 --> 00:04:12.740 align:middle line:90%


00:04:12.740 --> 00:04:14.880 align:middle line:84%
But there are lights that
haven't been turned on.

00:04:14.880 --> 00:04:22.160 align:middle line:90%


00:04:22.160 --> 00:04:26.480 align:middle line:84%
All it takes is that little
glimpse, that breakthrough,

00:04:26.480 --> 00:04:27.904 align:middle line:84%
that opening to
turn the light on.

00:04:27.904 --> 00:04:28.704 align:middle line:90%
What?

00:04:28.704 --> 00:04:31.420 align:middle line:90%


00:04:31.420 --> 00:04:36.135 align:middle line:84%
And whatever you're looking
at was there the whole time.

00:04:36.135 --> 00:04:38.420 align:middle line:84%
You know, we don't
acquire wisdom.

00:04:38.420 --> 00:04:40.870 align:middle line:90%
We get rid of things.

00:04:40.870 --> 00:04:44.930 align:middle line:84%
This is, as always, based on
the most simple spare things

00:04:44.930 --> 00:04:47.650 align:middle line:90%
we know.

00:04:47.650 --> 00:04:51.350 align:middle line:84%
You drop all these
acquired emotions

00:04:51.350 --> 00:04:55.660 align:middle line:90%
and prejudices and bad habits.

00:04:55.660 --> 00:04:58.642 align:middle line:84%
And you have, you get
ideally simpler, and simpler,

00:04:58.642 --> 00:04:59.926 align:middle line:90%
and simples.

00:04:59.926 --> 00:05:02.620 align:middle line:90%
More and more spare.

00:05:02.620 --> 00:05:06.640 align:middle line:84%
And I find that just very
beautiful and a great relief.

00:05:06.640 --> 00:05:08.910 align:middle line:90%
You just drop stuff.

00:05:08.910 --> 00:05:52.000 align:middle line:90%
