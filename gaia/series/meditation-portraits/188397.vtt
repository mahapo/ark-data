00:00:05.916 --> 00:00:10.170 align:middle line:10%
>> The insecurity of life, the
instability of life is so true

00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:11.750 align:middle line:10%
for each of us.

00:00:11.750 --> 00:00:14.510 align:middle line:84%
It's like any
single one of us can

00:00:14.510 --> 00:00:18.392 align:middle line:84%
check our cell phone messages
and listen to one message.

00:00:18.392 --> 00:00:20.600 align:middle line:84%
And by the time we hang up,
we have a different life.

00:00:20.600 --> 00:00:36.830 align:middle line:90%


00:00:36.830 --> 00:00:40.210 align:middle line:90%
My mother died when I was nine.

00:00:40.210 --> 00:00:41.800 align:middle line:90%
And then, my father disappeared.

00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:45.840 align:middle line:90%


00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:48.270 align:middle line:84%
By the time I went
to college, I had

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:52.530 align:middle line:84%
lived in five different
family configurations.

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:58.160 align:middle line:84%
I was just so deeply unhappy
and confused and frightened.

00:00:58.160 --> 00:01:00.900 align:middle line:84%
And that was all covered
over with this layer

00:01:00.900 --> 00:01:05.910 align:middle line:84%
of, as many people experience,
this kind of opaque silence.

00:01:05.910 --> 00:01:08.130 align:middle line:84%
Because no one ever talked
about what had happened.

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:13.320 align:middle line:90%


00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:15.990 align:middle line:84%
When I was a
sophomore in college,

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:17.790 align:middle line:84%
I had took an Asian
philosophy course.

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:20.280 align:middle line:84%
And honestly, looking
back, it feels like it

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:21.650 align:middle line:90%
was kind of happenstance.

00:01:21.650 --> 00:01:23.238 align:middle line:90%
I was on a Tuesday or something.

00:01:23.238 --> 00:01:24.780 align:middle line:84%
And I thought, oh,
that's convenient.

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:25.680 align:middle line:90%
I'll do that course.

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:28.090 align:middle line:84%
And it completely
changed my life.

00:01:28.090 --> 00:01:30.220 align:middle line:84%
It turned out to be
a course in Buddhism.

00:01:30.220 --> 00:01:32.520 align:middle line:84%
And the first thing I
heard in that course that

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:36.600 align:middle line:84%
was just riveting and amazing
was the Buddha's very unafraid,

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:39.370 align:middle line:84%
unashamed acknowledgment
of the suffering in life.

00:01:39.370 --> 00:01:41.220 align:middle line:84%
And so he was saying,
you're not alone.

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:43.790 align:middle line:84%
You don't have to feel weird
or isolated or cut off.

00:01:43.790 --> 00:01:45.150 align:middle line:90%
This is a part of life.

00:01:45.150 --> 00:01:52.940 align:middle line:90%


00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:55.120 align:middle line:84%
I think it's a pretty
revolutionary act

00:01:55.120 --> 00:01:59.800 align:middle line:84%
to admit and acknowledge the
suffering and the potential

00:01:59.800 --> 00:02:01.340 align:middle line:90%
for suffering that we all share.

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:04.780 align:middle line:84%
And it has, I think,
really for me brought me

00:02:04.780 --> 00:02:08.139 align:middle line:84%
to a different level of
understanding about compassion,

00:02:08.139 --> 00:02:12.980 align:middle line:84%
both compassion for myself
and compassion for others.

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:16.130 align:middle line:84%
Compassion, the trembling
or the quivering

00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:18.650 align:middle line:84%
of the heart in response
to seeing someone's pain

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:22.070 align:middle line:90%
or suffering.

00:02:22.070 --> 00:02:24.530 align:middle line:84%
We hear so many messages
about what we need

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:28.730 align:middle line:84%
and what we should have, and
we should never make a mistake.

00:02:28.730 --> 00:02:31.610 align:middle line:84%
There's so many things
that we kind of take on.

00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:34.190 align:middle line:84%
I think it's very powerful, and
it's kind of a big adventure,

00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:36.600 align:middle line:90%
to say, well, you know what?

00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:37.700 align:middle line:90%
Let me really look.

00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:40.010 align:middle line:90%
Let me see for myself.

00:02:40.010 --> 00:02:44.830 align:middle line:84%
So I feel very empowered by that
possibility of introspection

00:02:44.830 --> 00:02:49.055 align:middle line:84%
and discernment and not
necessarily believing

00:02:49.055 --> 00:02:49.855 align:middle line:90%
all those messages.

00:02:49.855 --> 00:02:54.010 align:middle line:90%


00:02:54.010 --> 00:02:56.180 align:middle line:90%
I do have a daily practice.

00:02:56.180 --> 00:03:00.110 align:middle line:84%
That's really the bedrock of
not only my day, but really

00:03:00.110 --> 00:03:01.030 align:middle line:90%
of my life.

00:03:01.030 --> 00:03:03.490 align:middle line:84%
Because if I think
about the qualities

00:03:03.490 --> 00:03:06.040 align:middle line:84%
I try to bring into
my day of integrity

00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:09.520 align:middle line:84%
or presence or
listening or compassion,

00:03:09.520 --> 00:03:11.420 align:middle line:84%
I really find it's
centered there.

00:03:11.420 --> 00:03:17.450 align:middle line:90%


00:03:17.450 --> 00:03:19.130 align:middle line:84%
I often do loving
kind of practice

00:03:19.130 --> 00:03:22.410 align:middle line:84%
just walking down the
streets in New York City.

00:03:22.410 --> 00:03:25.420 align:middle line:90%
It's great fun.

00:03:25.420 --> 00:03:29.250 align:middle line:84%
I'll be silently
offering phrases

00:03:29.250 --> 00:03:33.780 align:middle line:84%
of loving kindness to myself
as I walk down the street.

00:03:33.780 --> 00:03:34.592 align:middle line:90%
May you be happy.

00:03:34.592 --> 00:03:35.425 align:middle line:90%
May you be peaceful.

00:03:35.425 --> 00:03:38.860 align:middle line:90%


00:03:38.860 --> 00:03:42.190 align:middle line:84%
Then, as people walk by,
I'll just include them.

00:03:42.190 --> 00:03:45.770 align:middle line:84%
Just kind of silently
saying, be happy.

00:03:45.770 --> 00:03:46.885 align:middle line:90%
May you be happy.

00:03:46.885 --> 00:03:50.300 align:middle line:90%
May you be peaceful.

00:03:50.300 --> 00:03:52.530 align:middle line:84%
May you be happy, and
may you be peaceful.

00:03:52.530 --> 00:03:54.410 align:middle line:90%
Something like that.

00:03:54.410 --> 00:04:59.000 align:middle line:90%
