00:00:03.968 --> 00:00:06.450 align:middle line:90%


00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:09.270 align:middle line:84%
>> Let's give a warm welcome
to Emery Smith and Randy

00:00:09.270 --> 00:00:10.070 align:middle line:90%
Veitenheimer.

00:00:10.070 --> 00:00:13.269 align:middle line:90%
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:13.269 --> 00:00:14.190 align:middle line:90%


00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:17.370 align:middle line:90%
>> Thank you, guys.

00:00:17.370 --> 00:00:19.110 align:middle line:90%
Thank you so much.

00:00:19.110 --> 00:00:22.560 align:middle line:10%
We're not going to do a little
PowerPoint because Randy

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:24.960 align:middle line:10%
and I are really good
at just rambling on

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:27.540 align:middle line:10%
about amazing things, and it
leads to more amazing things.

00:00:27.540 --> 00:00:29.790 align:middle line:10%
And sometimes, we both
impress each other

00:00:29.790 --> 00:00:32.130 align:middle line:10%
and find out something
that we never--

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:33.770 align:middle line:10%
or we'll slip up
and say something

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:37.120 align:middle line:10%
that we were hiding from
each other for a while.

00:00:37.120 --> 00:00:39.360 align:middle line:10%
So that's always fun.

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:42.600 align:middle line:10%
The great thing about this
is in the projects, when

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:46.050 align:middle line:10%
I was working with
extraterrestrial entities

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:48.930 align:middle line:10%
and humans that
were very gifted,

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:51.720 align:middle line:10%
telepathy was one
of the main ways

00:00:51.720 --> 00:00:56.940 align:middle line:10%
to get a point across
in its totality.

00:00:56.940 --> 00:01:00.030 align:middle line:10%
And communication
is really the key

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:04.650 align:middle line:10%
to success in any
type of project.

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:10.170 align:middle line:10%
And in the beginning, there's
so many different languages

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:13.600 align:middle line:10%
out there that it can be
easily misinterpreted.

00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:16.350 align:middle line:10%
But with telepathy, it's not.

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:20.160 align:middle line:10%
So I'm going to ask
Randy a question.

00:01:20.160 --> 00:01:22.920 align:middle line:84%
How can we scientifically
talk about what

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:27.410 align:middle line:84%
comes first in your energy
field before you speak?

00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:32.020 align:middle line:10%
>> The way the human brain is
constructed is we say we have

00:01:32.020 --> 00:01:33.500 align:middle line:10%
a thought.

00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:38.020 align:middle line:10%
But that thought had to
flow through a neuropathway.

00:01:38.020 --> 00:01:41.030 align:middle line:90%
And so there is a time lapse.

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:43.150 align:middle line:84%
There is a time lapse
between having a thought

00:01:43.150 --> 00:01:45.190 align:middle line:90%
and expressing it, right?

00:01:45.190 --> 00:01:47.595 align:middle line:84%
So you have a thought,
and you think,

00:01:47.595 --> 00:01:49.720 align:middle line:84%
well, I originally had the
thought, and I spoke it.

00:01:49.720 --> 00:01:53.140 align:middle line:90%
But there's time lags in there.

00:01:53.140 --> 00:01:55.900 align:middle line:84%
And what that does is start
bringing in the question

00:01:55.900 --> 00:01:58.300 align:middle line:84%
is where did that
thought come from?

00:01:58.300 --> 00:02:04.750 align:middle line:84%
So it's easy in our educational
system to say I had a thought.

00:02:04.750 --> 00:02:08.729 align:middle line:84%
And we may not think that
that thought may have had us.

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:12.340 align:middle line:84%
It's a different way
of looking at things.

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:14.680 align:middle line:84%
So the physical reality
of having a thought

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:19.570 align:middle line:84%
is electrons or whatever
travel along neuropathways.

00:02:19.570 --> 00:02:24.670 align:middle line:84%
And they stimulate
the speech centers.

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:27.760 align:middle line:90%
And you say words.

00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:29.800 align:middle line:84%
But if you break it
down, that thought

00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:34.790 align:middle line:84%
originated way before that
as far as time is concerned.

00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:36.940 align:middle line:84%
So your thoughts do
originate somewhere else.

00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:40.120 align:middle line:84%
They don't originate in
the physicality of you.

00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:42.640 align:middle line:84%
And automatically,
that says that they

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:44.270 align:middle line:90%
originate in the field.

00:02:44.270 --> 00:02:47.890 align:middle line:84%
And we're going to call
that the information field.

00:02:47.890 --> 00:02:50.910 align:middle line:84%
So you contain an
information field.

00:02:50.910 --> 00:02:54.520 align:middle line:84%
If you think of yourself
as a bubble, a three foot

00:02:54.520 --> 00:02:59.050 align:middle line:84%
bubble, a nine foot bubble,
that is your information field.

00:02:59.050 --> 00:03:00.700 align:middle line:10%
That's your energy field.

00:03:00.700 --> 00:03:03.350 align:middle line:10%
Energy slowed down
this information.

00:03:03.350 --> 00:03:05.590 align:middle line:10%
So when you have
a thought and it

00:03:05.590 --> 00:03:07.870 align:middle line:10%
flows through the conscious
mind, subconscious,

00:03:07.870 --> 00:03:11.560 align:middle line:10%
unconscious, and you
finally express it,

00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:13.750 align:middle line:10%
it has gone through a process.

00:03:13.750 --> 00:03:15.880 align:middle line:10%
It has gone through
a process of filters.

00:03:15.880 --> 00:03:18.100 align:middle line:10%
It's gone through a
process of what language

00:03:18.100 --> 00:03:20.120 align:middle line:10%
you're going to speak it in.

00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:25.840 align:middle line:10%
It's amazing what all goes on
that you basically, unless you

00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:29.590 align:middle line:10%
spent hours not watching
the TV, finding out

00:03:29.590 --> 00:03:31.330 align:middle line:10%
like how does that work?

00:03:31.330 --> 00:03:34.420 align:middle line:10%
And I work on people, and
if they have a speech issue,

00:03:34.420 --> 00:03:37.060 align:middle line:10%
you actually have two speech
centers in the brain, not one.

00:03:37.060 --> 00:03:40.870 align:middle line:10%
And there can be a
breakdown in communication,

00:03:40.870 --> 00:03:43.690 align:middle line:10%
let alone drugs, alcohol, food.

00:03:43.690 --> 00:03:48.850 align:middle line:84%
Anything can affect the neuron
pathways and how they process.

00:03:48.850 --> 00:03:52.210 align:middle line:84%
But we go back to where
does that thought originate?

00:03:52.210 --> 00:03:55.570 align:middle line:84%
So it's possible
through meditation

00:03:55.570 --> 00:03:57.610 align:middle line:90%
to actually go looking.

00:03:57.610 --> 00:04:00.880 align:middle line:84%
And we look at people like
Tesla and Einstein, and they go,

00:04:00.880 --> 00:04:03.060 align:middle line:90%
I had this thought.

00:04:03.060 --> 00:04:05.050 align:middle line:84%
I literally woke
up, and I drew out

00:04:05.050 --> 00:04:06.880 align:middle line:90%
the entire electrical motor.

00:04:06.880 --> 00:04:12.640 align:middle line:84%
Or I drew out the
equations for relativity.

00:04:12.640 --> 00:04:15.700 align:middle line:10%
And each of those
very succinctly

00:04:15.700 --> 00:04:18.850 align:middle line:10%
said they weren't my thoughts.

00:04:18.850 --> 00:04:20.890 align:middle line:10%
They came to me.

00:04:20.890 --> 00:04:22.285 align:middle line:10%
And so we have that language.

00:04:22.285 --> 00:04:24.120 align:middle line:10%
Oh, something came to me.

00:04:24.120 --> 00:04:28.490 align:middle line:84%
And the way I think is to
go where did it come from?

00:04:28.490 --> 00:04:32.320 align:middle line:84%
So one of the other things
is that in martial arts,

00:04:32.320 --> 00:04:37.820 align:middle line:84%
we teach the distance
between time and action.

00:04:37.820 --> 00:04:40.510 align:middle line:84%
So I'm not giving you
a scientific thing.

00:04:40.510 --> 00:04:43.270 align:middle line:84%
I'm giving you martial
arts I learned, right?

00:04:43.270 --> 00:04:47.047 align:middle line:10%
And you think about the distance
between thought and action.

00:04:47.047 --> 00:04:48.880 align:middle line:84%
I have the thought,
like I'll throw a punch,

00:04:48.880 --> 00:04:52.480 align:middle line:84%
or I'll reach for something,
or I'll do something.

00:04:52.480 --> 00:04:56.680 align:middle line:84%
And that time lag was
something that we worked on

00:04:56.680 --> 00:04:58.120 align:middle line:90%
as a martial artist.

00:04:58.120 --> 00:05:00.550 align:middle line:84%
Because we said the distance
between thought and actions

00:05:00.550 --> 00:05:03.400 align:middle line:84%
instead of being this, we
would try to shrink it.

00:05:03.400 --> 00:05:06.550 align:middle line:10%
We would tried to shrink
it like before you can even

00:05:06.550 --> 00:05:07.840 align:middle line:10%
have a thought.

00:05:07.840 --> 00:05:10.600 align:middle line:84%
And today, we call it
catch a falling knife.

00:05:10.600 --> 00:05:14.920 align:middle line:84%
And you can see the movie
in "Mr. & Mrs. Smith," where

00:05:14.920 --> 00:05:17.740 align:middle line:84%
Angelina Jolie, he drops
the bottle of wine,

00:05:17.740 --> 00:05:19.630 align:middle line:90%
and she's like, right?

00:05:19.630 --> 00:05:20.980 align:middle line:90%
And she picks it up.

00:05:20.980 --> 00:05:23.320 align:middle line:84%
That is not a thought
process, right?

00:05:23.320 --> 00:05:26.710 align:middle line:90%
The action has preceded thought.

00:05:26.710 --> 00:05:30.220 align:middle line:84%
So any great martial
artist is one that

00:05:30.220 --> 00:05:34.130 align:middle line:90%
acts in front of the action.

00:05:34.130 --> 00:05:36.500 align:middle line:90%
The thought comes later.

00:05:36.500 --> 00:05:39.520 align:middle line:84%
And so now we have
the formula for being

00:05:39.520 --> 00:05:41.390 align:middle line:90%
efficient in our lives.

00:05:41.390 --> 00:05:44.800 align:middle line:84%
We want to learn to trust
that when the knife falls

00:05:44.800 --> 00:05:46.750 align:middle line:90%
or the bottle, I can grab it.

00:05:46.750 --> 00:05:49.420 align:middle line:84%
And it has a lot
of applications.

00:05:49.420 --> 00:05:51.940 align:middle line:84%
But the major one
is in your speech

00:05:51.940 --> 00:05:53.990 align:middle line:90%
and how you talk to people.

00:05:53.990 --> 00:05:59.770 align:middle line:10%
Emery had brought
up about your words.

00:05:59.770 --> 00:06:02.630 align:middle line:10%
If I say something
negative to you.

00:06:02.630 --> 00:06:07.240 align:middle line:10%
And as humans, we're
very subtle about that.

00:06:07.240 --> 00:06:10.850 align:middle line:10%
Where did you buy those
clothes, or who did your hair?

00:06:10.850 --> 00:06:14.110 align:middle line:10%
Yeah, there's lots of ways
that can be expressed.

00:06:14.110 --> 00:06:16.600 align:middle line:10%
Now, as a negative
thought, it registers

00:06:16.600 --> 00:06:18.370 align:middle line:10%
in your electromagnetic field.

00:06:18.370 --> 00:06:19.600 align:middle line:10%
Remember that bubble.

00:06:19.600 --> 00:06:20.740 align:middle line:90%
And it alters.

00:06:20.740 --> 00:06:23.230 align:middle line:84%
And it alters your
neurochemistry, respiration

00:06:23.230 --> 00:06:25.360 align:middle line:90%
rate, brainwave activity.

00:06:25.360 --> 00:06:27.280 align:middle line:90%
I mean, I can go on forever.

00:06:27.280 --> 00:06:30.640 align:middle line:84%
But we don't register
the effects of that.

00:06:30.640 --> 00:06:32.590 align:middle line:84%
But if I add a
little energy, like

00:06:32.590 --> 00:06:34.810 align:middle line:90%
where did you-- did you see?

00:06:34.810 --> 00:06:37.720 align:middle line:84%
Upping the game, I'm
upping the amperage.

00:06:37.720 --> 00:06:42.880 align:middle line:84%
And then, if I apply a motion
to it, oh my gosh, right?

00:06:42.880 --> 00:06:44.950 align:middle line:10%
Now we're at a separate level.

00:06:44.950 --> 00:06:49.450 align:middle line:84%
But now if I employ curse
words, if I employ curse words,

00:06:49.450 --> 00:06:52.400 align:middle line:84%
I am trying to alter
the literally thought

00:06:52.400 --> 00:06:55.880 align:middle line:84%
processes in your body and
the functions in your body.

00:06:55.880 --> 00:06:59.940 align:middle line:84%
And I call them emotional
vampires or whatever.

00:06:59.940 --> 00:07:01.610 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes we call
them mom and dad.

00:07:01.610 --> 00:07:03.470 align:middle line:84%
We all have that
experience in our life--

00:07:03.470 --> 00:07:06.320 align:middle line:90%


00:07:06.320 --> 00:07:09.260 align:middle line:84%
brothers, sisters, wives,
husbands, everybody

00:07:09.260 --> 00:07:10.850 align:middle line:90%
gets in the game.

00:07:10.850 --> 00:07:13.010 align:middle line:84%
So what's your
defense against that

00:07:13.010 --> 00:07:14.750 align:middle line:90%
is to have a big energy field.

00:07:14.750 --> 00:07:16.640 align:middle line:84%
How do you get a
bigger energy field?

00:07:16.640 --> 00:07:17.765 align:middle line:90%
You can just walk.

00:07:17.765 --> 00:07:19.640 align:middle line:84%
That's one way to increase
your energy field.

00:07:19.640 --> 00:07:22.130 align:middle line:84%
And of course, I teach a
lot of different methods.

00:07:22.130 --> 00:07:25.310 align:middle line:84%
But doing log
rolls like children

00:07:25.310 --> 00:07:29.010 align:middle line:84%
do, do them breathing
exercises, and then here we go.

00:07:29.010 --> 00:07:31.760 align:middle line:84%
You can go out there and
find lots of esoteric ways

00:07:31.760 --> 00:07:33.230 align:middle line:90%
through yoga, martial arts.

00:07:33.230 --> 00:07:35.990 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it's just
all over the place.

00:07:35.990 --> 00:07:38.560 align:middle line:84%
But it's up to you
to go find that.

00:07:38.560 --> 00:07:42.640 align:middle line:84%
It's not for you to just sit
there and what we call take it,

00:07:42.640 --> 00:07:43.760 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:07:43.760 --> 00:07:45.650 align:middle line:84%
And if somebody has
altered your energy field

00:07:45.650 --> 00:07:49.190 align:middle line:84%
by being mean to you, I call
it, or being ugly, I call it,

00:07:49.190 --> 00:07:52.320 align:middle line:84%
then it's your job
to get rid of it.

00:07:52.320 --> 00:07:56.690 align:middle line:10%
And so we do active denial
systems is what we call it,

00:07:56.690 --> 00:07:59.990 align:middle line:10%
where we actually, oh, somebody
said something negative to me,

00:07:59.990 --> 00:08:02.840 align:middle line:10%
and I'm going to take it and
throw it out of my energy

00:08:02.840 --> 00:08:05.070 align:middle line:10%
system, out of my field.

00:08:05.070 --> 00:08:08.750 align:middle line:84%
And so if you have a negative
thought about your childhood

00:08:08.750 --> 00:08:11.505 align:middle line:84%
or anything that went on,
you need to get rid of it.

00:08:11.505 --> 00:08:13.130 align:middle line:84%
And of course, one
of the things that I

00:08:13.130 --> 00:08:15.400 align:middle line:84%
like Emery had talked
about was if you

00:08:15.400 --> 00:08:20.030 align:middle line:84%
go in and talk to
somebody or something,

00:08:20.030 --> 00:08:21.920 align:middle line:90%
you need to be neutral.

00:08:21.920 --> 00:08:26.030 align:middle line:10%
You need to not have negative
emotions or negative thoughts

00:08:26.030 --> 00:08:31.520 align:middle line:10%
because we know some
people pick those up, OK?

00:08:31.520 --> 00:08:35.840 align:middle line:84%
But ETs and things like
that, they really pick it up.

00:08:35.840 --> 00:08:41.090 align:middle line:10%
And on planet Earth, the ETs can
be a horse or a dog or a cat.

00:08:41.090 --> 00:08:42.559 align:middle line:10%
They pick it up too.

00:08:42.559 --> 00:08:47.570 align:middle line:84%
And the fish, and anything else,
so we are in communication.

00:08:47.570 --> 00:08:50.300 align:middle line:84%
And negative thinking,
negative application

00:08:50.300 --> 00:08:53.360 align:middle line:84%
of thoughts to alter
somebody else's behavior

00:08:53.360 --> 00:08:57.560 align:middle line:84%
is that you're required to
examine your own language.

00:08:57.560 --> 00:08:59.770 align:middle line:90%
Don't hurt people, OK?

00:08:59.770 --> 00:09:03.470 align:middle line:10%
>> Yeah, staying neutral
is the key to that in all

00:09:03.470 --> 00:09:04.460 align:middle line:10%
communication.

00:09:04.460 --> 00:09:10.280 align:middle line:10%
Because if something
is affecting you,

00:09:10.280 --> 00:09:13.070 align:middle line:10%
that person might
be being just them,

00:09:13.070 --> 00:09:15.710 align:middle line:10%
and you're taking it
the wrong way maybe.

00:09:15.710 --> 00:09:18.470 align:middle line:84%
And you cannot
overreact emotionally

00:09:18.470 --> 00:09:21.590 align:middle line:84%
because that's the
first step in telepathy.

00:09:21.590 --> 00:09:24.200 align:middle line:84%
Before I go into a room
with an extraterrestrial,

00:09:24.200 --> 00:09:26.210 align:middle line:90%
I have to really ground myself.

00:09:26.210 --> 00:09:29.390 align:middle line:84%
I have to reset myself and
take a couple deep breaths.

00:09:29.390 --> 00:09:32.570 align:middle line:84%
Because if I go in there-- and
I don't know how many of you

00:09:32.570 --> 00:09:34.820 align:middle line:90%
came to my other talk.

00:09:34.820 --> 00:09:36.350 align:middle line:90%
You guys, OK.

00:09:36.350 --> 00:09:39.410 align:middle line:84%
I was talking about one
day working in the projects

00:09:39.410 --> 00:09:42.410 align:middle line:84%
where I'd walk into a room
with an extraterrestrial

00:09:42.410 --> 00:09:44.490 align:middle line:84%
that I was going to be
working with that day.

00:09:44.490 --> 00:09:47.210 align:middle line:84%
And if I had just gotten in
a fight with a loved one,

00:09:47.210 --> 00:09:49.590 align:middle line:84%
and I came in, and
I'm all pent up,

00:09:49.590 --> 00:09:53.540 align:middle line:84%
but I can hide it very well,
despite looking into 3D.

00:09:53.540 --> 00:09:57.020 align:middle line:84%
And I said to this
extraterrestrial hello.

00:09:57.020 --> 00:10:01.860 align:middle line:84%
But if I'm upset to them in
telepathy, it's like hello.

00:10:01.860 --> 00:10:04.070 align:middle line:84%
They're like, I
usually say hello.

00:10:04.070 --> 00:10:06.320 align:middle line:84%
But I didn't want to
make you guys jump.

00:10:06.320 --> 00:10:08.630 align:middle line:84%
But since you didn't
jump the first time.

00:10:08.630 --> 00:10:12.000 align:middle line:90%
And that is transmitted to you.

00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:14.690 align:middle line:84%
And now that person has
to reflect that energy

00:10:14.690 --> 00:10:16.580 align:middle line:90%
or let that energy go by.

00:10:16.580 --> 00:10:18.150 align:middle line:90%
And this is what we do.

00:10:18.150 --> 00:10:21.590 align:middle line:84%
We teach you how to put
up a field of energy that

00:10:21.590 --> 00:10:23.510 align:middle line:84%
also can reflect it
back if you're really

00:10:23.510 --> 00:10:25.370 align:middle line:90%
getting attacked really hard.

00:10:25.370 --> 00:10:30.770 align:middle line:84%
But we're talking about also not
so much of the negative aspects

00:10:30.770 --> 00:10:34.670 align:middle line:84%
of this because the best
thing about this is, you know,

00:10:34.670 --> 00:10:38.340 align:middle line:84%
Randy is a very
skilled martial artist.

00:10:38.340 --> 00:10:42.920 align:middle line:10%
And when we were
younger, him and I were--

00:10:42.920 --> 00:10:44.720 align:middle line:10%
we liked challenges.

00:10:44.720 --> 00:10:48.020 align:middle line:84%
We were young guys,
and we had no fear

00:10:48.020 --> 00:10:52.050 align:middle line:84%
of fighting because we were
just very cocky guys growing up.

00:10:52.050 --> 00:10:52.850 align:middle line:90%
You more than me.

00:10:52.850 --> 00:10:54.510 align:middle line:90%
I'm nicer.

00:10:54.510 --> 00:10:55.970 align:middle line:90%
But--

00:10:55.970 --> 00:10:59.300 align:middle line:90%
>> They've made a movie.

00:10:59.300 --> 00:11:01.490 align:middle line:90%
What was "Michael," right?

00:11:01.490 --> 00:11:03.830 align:middle line:84%
But I couldn't star
in that, so they

00:11:03.830 --> 00:11:06.960 align:middle line:90%
got John Travolta to do it.

00:11:06.960 --> 00:11:10.060 align:middle line:90%
But the idea is a battle.

00:11:10.060 --> 00:11:14.830 align:middle line:84%
At one point the movie,
it's like battle, right?

00:11:14.830 --> 00:11:17.960 align:middle line:84%
And it's a sad thing, but
some of my instructors go,

00:11:17.960 --> 00:11:21.050 align:middle line:84%
you like this way
too much, right?

00:11:21.050 --> 00:11:24.230 align:middle line:84%
So most people in their
life try to avoid battle.

00:11:24.230 --> 00:11:28.560 align:middle line:84%
And for some reason I
don't have that gene.

00:11:28.560 --> 00:11:30.320 align:middle line:10%
So life has been interesting.

00:11:30.320 --> 00:11:31.310 align:middle line:90%
But what he just--

00:11:31.310 --> 00:11:31.370 align:middle line:90%


00:11:31.370 --> 00:11:33.578 align:middle line:84%
>> You took it around and
you did it to the positive.

00:11:33.578 --> 00:11:35.070 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, we tried
to learn from it.

00:11:35.070 --> 00:11:39.380 align:middle line:84%
So just like when
Emery raised his voice,

00:11:39.380 --> 00:11:40.820 align:middle line:90%
that's vibrational medicine.

00:11:40.820 --> 00:11:42.770 align:middle line:84%
People go, what's
vibrational medicine?

00:11:42.770 --> 00:11:44.620 align:middle line:90%
That's vibrational medicine.

00:11:44.620 --> 00:11:48.290 align:middle line:84%
He just caused a
startle response, right?

00:11:48.290 --> 00:11:51.760 align:middle line:84%
And you have no control
over that for most people.

00:11:51.760 --> 00:11:54.580 align:middle line:84%
And so that's what we're
talking about when you're

00:11:54.580 --> 00:11:56.410 align:middle line:90%
negative to other people.

00:11:56.410 --> 00:11:58.780 align:middle line:90%
And we'll get into--

00:11:58.780 --> 00:12:02.590 align:middle line:84%
or I'll talk just real quick
about how do you do this?

00:12:02.590 --> 00:12:05.620 align:middle line:84%
How do you gain control
of it or not be affected?

00:12:05.620 --> 00:12:09.100 align:middle line:84%
And of course, in Native
American language,

00:12:09.100 --> 00:12:12.640 align:middle line:84%
we call it learn to see
and learn to listen.

00:12:12.640 --> 00:12:17.950 align:middle line:84%
And the way you do that is
just like a two-year-old.

00:12:17.950 --> 00:12:19.940 align:middle line:90%
Look at me.

00:12:19.940 --> 00:12:20.740 align:middle line:90%
Look at me.

00:12:20.740 --> 00:12:21.190 align:middle line:90%
Look at me.

00:12:21.190 --> 00:12:21.670 align:middle line:90%
Look at me.

00:12:21.670 --> 00:12:22.090 align:middle line:90%
Look at me.

00:12:22.090 --> 00:12:22.930 align:middle line:90%
Look-- right?

00:12:22.930 --> 00:12:25.750 align:middle line:90%
Look at me being mad, OK?

00:12:25.750 --> 00:12:27.400 align:middle line:90%
Next time you're angry go--

00:12:27.400 --> 00:12:30.820 align:middle line:84%
immediately run over and
stand in front of a mirror.

00:12:30.820 --> 00:12:33.700 align:middle line:84%
I've never had anybody stand
there for more than a minute.

00:12:33.700 --> 00:12:36.780 align:middle line:84%
You just-- you can't
stand it, all right?

00:12:36.780 --> 00:12:37.810 align:middle line:90%
And then listen to me.

00:12:37.810 --> 00:12:41.450 align:middle line:84%
Listen to me yelling at somebody
or creating a startle response

00:12:41.450 --> 00:12:42.250 align:middle line:90%
or--

00:12:42.250 --> 00:12:46.490 align:middle line:84%
so all of this doesn't
require a guru.

00:12:46.490 --> 00:12:48.580 align:middle line:90%
You become your own teacher.

00:12:48.580 --> 00:12:51.280 align:middle line:90%
It's like, look at me being mad.

00:12:51.280 --> 00:12:54.880 align:middle line:84%
Listen to me using
my voice in some way

00:12:54.880 --> 00:12:59.050 align:middle line:84%
to try to influence somebody
else to do something.

00:12:59.050 --> 00:13:00.466 align:middle line:90%
Go ahead.

00:13:00.466 --> 00:13:04.990 align:middle line:84%
>> And this falls into now
taking something that we

00:13:04.990 --> 00:13:08.020 align:middle line:84%
learned to hurt someone in
martial arts and turning it

00:13:08.020 --> 00:13:09.010 align:middle line:90%
around to heal people.

00:13:09.010 --> 00:13:09.810 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:13:09.810 --> 00:13:13.540 align:middle line:84%
>> And that's these vibrations
that we're talking about is

00:13:13.540 --> 00:13:16.040 align:middle line:90%
your specialty energy.

00:13:16.040 --> 00:13:19.690 align:middle line:84%
It's about imposing
this energy upon someone

00:13:19.690 --> 00:13:21.360 align:middle line:90%
and empowering them.

00:13:21.360 --> 00:13:23.110 align:middle line:84%
And it's really important
for your health.

00:13:23.110 --> 00:13:26.950 align:middle line:10%
Because a lot of the health
reasons and concerns a lot

00:13:26.950 --> 00:13:31.880 align:middle line:10%
of people get disease
and famine from it

00:13:31.880 --> 00:13:35.830 align:middle line:10%
is because they are stressed
for some reason, which

00:13:35.830 --> 00:13:38.290 align:middle line:10%
creates all this inflammation.

00:13:38.290 --> 00:13:40.180 align:middle line:84%
And then that affects
your chemicals

00:13:40.180 --> 00:13:43.430 align:middle line:84%
in your blood, which affects
the chemicals in your brain.

00:13:43.430 --> 00:13:45.640 align:middle line:10%
And then you start
sometimes behaving--

00:13:45.640 --> 00:13:49.300 align:middle line:10%
misbehaving or saying things
that you normally wouldn't say.

00:13:49.300 --> 00:13:53.210 align:middle line:84%
Because it affects the totality
of this physical 3D body,

00:13:53.210 --> 00:13:55.360 align:middle line:90%
including your energy field.

00:13:55.360 --> 00:13:56.560 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:13:56.560 --> 00:14:02.020 align:middle line:84%
Stress, it really-- we say
stress is the only illness.

00:14:02.020 --> 00:14:04.480 align:middle line:84%
If you stress the
system, and you

00:14:04.480 --> 00:14:07.030 align:middle line:84%
can do that through
language, you

00:14:07.030 --> 00:14:10.780 align:middle line:84%
can do it through situations,
environment, chemicals, food,

00:14:10.780 --> 00:14:12.855 align:middle line:90%
relationship, it's everything.

00:14:12.855 --> 00:14:14.980 align:middle line:84%
Everything can stress your
environment to the point

00:14:14.980 --> 00:14:18.460 align:middle line:90%
where your vibration changes.

00:14:18.460 --> 00:14:19.600 align:middle line:90%
You tighten up the body.

00:14:19.600 --> 00:14:23.910 align:middle line:84%
It's like tighten up a guitar
string or a drum head, right?

00:14:23.910 --> 00:14:26.800 align:middle line:84%
And then you go, well, I'm going
to go home and go to sleep.

00:14:26.800 --> 00:14:29.710 align:middle line:90%
But you didn't undo all of it.

00:14:29.710 --> 00:14:32.940 align:middle line:10%
So of all the things they
teach out there, go do yoga,

00:14:32.940 --> 00:14:34.540 align:middle line:10%
go do meditation.

00:14:34.540 --> 00:14:38.620 align:middle line:84%
And it's like, go undo the
stress you went through today.

00:14:38.620 --> 00:14:42.120 align:middle line:84%
Because if you didn't, now
you're going to reservoir it.

00:14:42.120 --> 00:14:44.150 align:middle line:84%
And a day, a week,
a month, a year.

00:14:44.150 --> 00:14:47.410 align:middle line:84%
That's why illnesses take so
long to manifest as a rule.

00:14:47.410 --> 00:14:49.690 align:middle line:90%
You didn't get sick today.

00:14:49.690 --> 00:14:53.810 align:middle line:84%
You got stressed or tense
20 years ago, 30 years ago.

00:14:53.810 --> 00:14:55.930 align:middle line:90%
And it's just now showing up.

00:14:55.930 --> 00:14:59.350 align:middle line:84%
So every day we do
that, it's like that's

00:14:59.350 --> 00:15:03.670 align:middle line:84%
where we say find a walk, hug
a tree, play with a dog, cat,

00:15:03.670 --> 00:15:04.490 align:middle line:90%
right?

00:15:04.490 --> 00:15:07.020 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't make any difference
what technique you use.

00:15:07.020 --> 00:15:11.560 align:middle line:84%
So you don't need to become
enamored of gurus and healers

00:15:11.560 --> 00:15:13.750 align:middle line:90%
and people like me.

00:15:13.750 --> 00:15:16.640 align:middle line:90%
Because everybody is capable.

00:15:16.640 --> 00:15:20.290 align:middle line:84%
And we know that because
children do it automatically.

00:15:20.290 --> 00:15:23.320 align:middle line:84%
They get stressed and up to
about three or four years old,

00:15:23.320 --> 00:15:25.020 align:middle line:90%
and they're not--

00:15:25.020 --> 00:15:26.980 align:middle line:90%
I mean, it's just--

00:15:26.980 --> 00:15:29.050 align:middle line:90%
so we say, learn to be that way.

00:15:29.050 --> 00:15:32.680 align:middle line:84%
And you do it through observing
yourself and hearing yourself.

00:15:32.680 --> 00:15:34.775 align:middle line:84%
That's the Native
American language.

00:15:34.775 --> 00:15:36.640 align:middle line:90%
>> So that's the first step.

00:15:36.640 --> 00:15:39.055 align:middle line:90%
Once you can be you.

00:15:39.055 --> 00:15:39.880 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:15:39.880 --> 00:15:45.070 align:middle line:84%
>> Once you're you, the next
step is the communication.

00:15:45.070 --> 00:15:47.860 align:middle line:84%
And then after that, you can
do really fun things, like buy,

00:15:47.860 --> 00:15:49.990 align:middle line:90%
locate, remote viewing.

00:15:49.990 --> 00:15:52.720 align:middle line:84%
But you have to be centered
and be in that space

00:15:52.720 --> 00:15:55.630 align:middle line:90%
first to be able to do that.

00:15:55.630 --> 00:15:59.310 align:middle line:84%
And let's talk a little
about remote viewing

00:15:59.310 --> 00:16:00.310 align:middle line:90%
and how that works.

00:16:00.310 --> 00:16:04.630 align:middle line:84%
And also from there, we'll
get into some bi-location.

00:16:04.630 --> 00:16:08.410 align:middle line:84%
Because we're here and
there all the time.

00:16:08.410 --> 00:16:12.060 align:middle line:84%
It's just, when do
you want to be there?

00:16:12.060 --> 00:16:14.170 align:middle line:90%
>> There's no there.

00:16:14.170 --> 00:16:18.130 align:middle line:84%
People that study physics and
think about time and travel,

00:16:18.130 --> 00:16:19.490 align:middle line:90%
there doesn't exist.

00:16:19.490 --> 00:16:20.880 align:middle line:90%
I'll just put it that way.

00:16:20.880 --> 00:16:22.630 align:middle line:84%
I can get into a long
explanation of that,

00:16:22.630 --> 00:16:27.530 align:middle line:84%
but as an example of
what we're talking about.

00:16:27.530 --> 00:16:31.210 align:middle line:84%
You ever talk to a relative
or loved one on the phone?

00:16:31.210 --> 00:16:33.910 align:middle line:90%


00:16:33.910 --> 00:16:37.120 align:middle line:84%
You ever do it with
your eyes closed?

00:16:37.120 --> 00:16:40.368 align:middle line:84%
So if I'm talking to you
right here, if I close my eyes

00:16:40.368 --> 00:16:42.910 align:middle line:84%
and I know you and I've talked
to you a while and stuff, when

00:16:42.910 --> 00:16:45.070 align:middle line:84%
I close my eyes, you're
still sitting there.

00:16:45.070 --> 00:16:46.320 align:middle line:90%
You could be somewhere else.

00:16:46.320 --> 00:16:48.070 align:middle line:84%
And we know this when
we go to the airport

00:16:48.070 --> 00:16:50.530 align:middle line:90%
and you see somebody going--

00:16:50.530 --> 00:16:52.810 align:middle line:84%
like the other person's
in front of them.

00:16:52.810 --> 00:16:55.480 align:middle line:84%
It's like, I'm going to use
my hands to help communicate.

00:16:55.480 --> 00:16:56.650 align:middle line:90%
You're on the phone.

00:16:56.650 --> 00:16:58.620 align:middle line:90%
They can't see that.

00:16:58.620 --> 00:17:02.600 align:middle line:84%
But we still--
it's fun to watch.

00:17:02.600 --> 00:17:06.140 align:middle line:84%
So what's happening,
your consciousness

00:17:06.140 --> 00:17:10.400 align:middle line:84%
is accepting the other person's
presence within your own energy

00:17:10.400 --> 00:17:11.359 align:middle line:90%
field.

00:17:11.359 --> 00:17:13.369 align:middle line:84%
Now, it's done through
memory, and it's

00:17:13.369 --> 00:17:14.390 align:middle line:90%
done through connection.

00:17:14.390 --> 00:17:16.460 align:middle line:90%
Those are two different things.

00:17:16.460 --> 00:17:19.760 align:middle line:84%
But if I look at you and close
my eyes, I still see you.

00:17:19.760 --> 00:17:21.560 align:middle line:84%
They call it retinal
burn, or whatever,

00:17:21.560 --> 00:17:27.589 align:middle line:84%
depend on your hair and
makeup and a few other things.

00:17:27.589 --> 00:17:30.080 align:middle line:90%
So I can retain that image.

00:17:30.080 --> 00:17:34.010 align:middle line:84%
But if somebody really know a
child or a parent or something,

00:17:34.010 --> 00:17:37.070 align:middle line:84%
as soon as you close your eyes,
you're right there with them.

00:17:37.070 --> 00:17:38.830 align:middle line:90%
So there really is no distance.

00:17:38.830 --> 00:17:41.480 align:middle line:90%


00:17:41.480 --> 00:17:43.530 align:middle line:84%
Somebody can be
across the planet.

00:17:43.530 --> 00:17:45.080 align:middle line:90%
We don't need face time.

00:17:45.080 --> 00:17:47.150 align:middle line:84%
We just close our
eyes and I'm dealing

00:17:47.150 --> 00:17:51.770 align:middle line:84%
with what I hold in memory
as an image of that person.

00:17:51.770 --> 00:17:53.750 align:middle line:84%
And that's why we say
when somebody dies,

00:17:53.750 --> 00:17:56.600 align:middle line:84%
you don't have to stop loving
them or thinking about them

00:17:56.600 --> 00:17:58.340 align:middle line:90%
or be sad about them.

00:17:58.340 --> 00:18:00.330 align:middle line:90%
Unless you're happy about that.

00:18:00.330 --> 00:18:04.430 align:middle line:84%
But, yeah-- so
you're able to see

00:18:04.430 --> 00:18:07.400 align:middle line:90%
in your mind's eye that person.

00:18:07.400 --> 00:18:10.480 align:middle line:90%
Now, we can even increase that.

00:18:10.480 --> 00:18:13.040 align:middle line:84%
I can increase that
to the point that you

00:18:13.040 --> 00:18:15.570 align:middle line:84%
may have a sense of me
sitting next to you,

00:18:15.570 --> 00:18:17.930 align:middle line:84%
even though you may
have 1,000 miles away.

00:18:17.930 --> 00:18:21.830 align:middle line:84%
So this is the concept
of remote viewing.

00:18:21.830 --> 00:18:27.000 align:middle line:84%
It's the idea that your
presence can be anywhere.

00:18:27.000 --> 00:18:29.210 align:middle line:84%
When the language
originally spoken

00:18:29.210 --> 00:18:31.760 align:middle line:84%
was that, if you
think of Mars, you're

00:18:31.760 --> 00:18:36.080 align:middle line:84%
on Mars to some degree of
your consciousness, right?

00:18:36.080 --> 00:18:40.370 align:middle line:84%
The difference is maybe
99% here and 1% there.

00:18:40.370 --> 00:18:42.200 align:middle line:84%
But Harvard did a
study that said,

00:18:42.200 --> 00:18:45.200 align:middle line:84%
when you go to sleep at night,
you take your senses with you.

00:18:45.200 --> 00:18:48.960 align:middle line:84%
And of course, they didn't say
what you take your senses with,

00:18:48.960 --> 00:18:49.760 align:middle line:90%
right?

00:18:49.760 --> 00:18:53.690 align:middle line:84%
But it's your energy, body, it's
your soul, it's your astral--

00:18:53.690 --> 00:18:55.670 align:middle line:90%
whatever you want to call it.

00:18:55.670 --> 00:19:00.560 align:middle line:84%
But there's ways to increase
the awareness of where you are.

00:19:00.560 --> 00:19:04.040 align:middle line:84%
You do it automatically when
you dream, especially vivid

00:19:04.040 --> 00:19:06.200 align:middle line:90%
dreaming or lucid dreaming.

00:19:06.200 --> 00:19:10.760 align:middle line:84%
You're in a state where, I was
there and the wind was blowing,

00:19:10.760 --> 00:19:12.510 align:middle line:90%
and you can describe all of it.

00:19:12.510 --> 00:19:13.310 align:middle line:90%
Why?

00:19:13.310 --> 00:19:15.830 align:middle line:84%
Because you were there
without your body,

00:19:15.830 --> 00:19:17.760 align:middle line:90%
without your physical body.

00:19:17.760 --> 00:19:19.670 align:middle line:90%
So that is remote viewing.

00:19:19.670 --> 00:19:20.940 align:middle line:90%
Everybody does it.

00:19:20.940 --> 00:19:23.240 align:middle line:84%
But they make a big deal
like, oh, you need to go study

00:19:23.240 --> 00:19:24.800 align:middle line:90%
and you need to meditate.

00:19:24.800 --> 00:19:29.090 align:middle line:90%
This is the SRI way to do it.

00:19:29.090 --> 00:19:32.660 align:middle line:84%
And meditation and
things like that, we

00:19:32.660 --> 00:19:35.420 align:middle line:84%
learn that we can do it
just by closing our eyes

00:19:35.420 --> 00:19:36.980 align:middle line:90%
and being there.

00:19:36.980 --> 00:19:38.070 align:middle line:90%
There's no process.

00:19:38.070 --> 00:19:40.310 align:middle line:84%
There's no steps
of where you go,

00:19:40.310 --> 00:19:42.770 align:middle line:84%
step A, B, C and
now I'm thinking

00:19:42.770 --> 00:19:45.860 align:middle line:90%
about Chicago or something.

00:19:45.860 --> 00:19:48.680 align:middle line:84%
So these are things like you
sit down and just explore

00:19:48.680 --> 00:19:49.860 align:middle line:90%
on your own.

00:19:49.860 --> 00:19:53.450 align:middle line:84%
But I'm telling you there's
no process involved.

00:19:53.450 --> 00:19:57.140 align:middle line:84%
If I'm talking to my
daughter 10 states away

00:19:57.140 --> 00:19:59.853 align:middle line:84%
when I close my eyes, I'm
talking to her right here.

00:19:59.853 --> 00:20:00.770 align:middle line:90%
And that's what we do.

00:20:00.770 --> 00:20:03.440 align:middle line:84%
You can hear your voice
levels and everything else,

00:20:03.440 --> 00:20:06.800 align:middle line:84%
and they're all reflective of
the presence of another person

00:20:06.800 --> 00:20:09.560 align:middle line:90%
within proximity.

00:20:09.560 --> 00:20:11.720 align:middle line:84%
And I'm not supposed
to talk about,

00:20:11.720 --> 00:20:14.300 align:middle line:84%
I have a book called,
"Approximate Reality,"

00:20:14.300 --> 00:20:15.817 align:middle line:90%
that deals with this.

00:20:15.817 --> 00:20:17.900 align:middle line:84%
And of course, I've been
working on it five years.

00:20:17.900 --> 00:20:21.800 align:middle line:84%
And check back in five years
and I'll probably have it done.

00:20:21.800 --> 00:20:22.910 align:middle line:90%
But it deals with this.

00:20:22.910 --> 00:20:26.960 align:middle line:84%
You get used to the fact
that you have presence.

00:20:26.960 --> 00:20:29.120 align:middle line:84%
And if you're talking on
the phone and driving,

00:20:29.120 --> 00:20:31.250 align:middle line:84%
you don't have presence
in, number one,

00:20:31.250 --> 00:20:33.300 align:middle line:90%
reality, this reality.

00:20:33.300 --> 00:20:36.740 align:middle line:84%
So I would tell you if you're
having dinner with somebody

00:20:36.740 --> 00:20:39.320 align:middle line:84%
or talking with somebody,
put the dang phone down

00:20:39.320 --> 00:20:41.750 align:middle line:90%
and look at them, right?

00:20:41.750 --> 00:20:42.770 align:middle line:90%
Be with them.

00:20:42.770 --> 00:20:44.250 align:middle line:90%
That's a language.

00:20:44.250 --> 00:20:46.310 align:middle line:84%
So we want to be
with somebody when

00:20:46.310 --> 00:20:49.270 align:middle line:84%
we're with somebody and not
kind of be with somebody.

00:20:49.270 --> 00:20:52.100 align:middle line:84%
It is probably one of the
greatest deviations that

00:20:52.100 --> 00:20:55.430 align:middle line:84%
takes us away from having
successful relationships

00:20:55.430 --> 00:20:58.580 align:middle line:84%
and successful financial
careers and things like that.

00:20:58.580 --> 00:21:00.470 align:middle line:90%
We're not fully present.

00:21:00.470 --> 00:21:05.030 align:middle line:84%
And so I invite all
of you to try to find

00:21:05.030 --> 00:21:07.970 align:middle line:90%
ways to come back to being you.

00:21:07.970 --> 00:21:11.520 align:middle line:10%
That's a primary job, I
execute an energy medicine,

00:21:11.520 --> 00:21:14.570 align:middle line:10%
is to get you back
to being yourself.

00:21:14.570 --> 00:21:17.240 align:middle line:84%
But it's something that if you
will take some time every day

00:21:17.240 --> 00:21:18.650 align:middle line:90%
you can do.

00:21:18.650 --> 00:21:23.000 align:middle line:84%
If you do that, your abilities
in a lot of different areas--

00:21:23.000 --> 00:21:27.560 align:middle line:84%
remote viewing, communication
with pets, communication

00:21:27.560 --> 00:21:28.880 align:middle line:90%
with dead people--

00:21:28.880 --> 00:21:30.170 align:middle line:90%
you can enhance all that.

00:21:30.170 --> 00:21:33.050 align:middle line:90%


00:21:33.050 --> 00:21:39.720 align:middle line:84%
>> Which is-- speaking of dead
people and extraterrestrials,

00:21:39.720 --> 00:21:43.380 align:middle line:84%
it's the type of dimensions,
interdimensional,

00:21:43.380 --> 00:21:44.820 align:middle line:90%
some of these energies.

00:21:44.820 --> 00:21:49.290 align:middle line:84%
And how would you
define interdimensional

00:21:49.290 --> 00:21:56.175 align:middle line:84%
and how it correlates with
our energies and who we are?

00:21:56.175 --> 00:21:59.370 align:middle line:90%
>> Anybody here have cats?

00:21:59.370 --> 00:22:01.860 align:middle line:90%
Anybody here have dogs?

00:22:01.860 --> 00:22:04.750 align:middle line:90%
What's the difference, right?

00:22:04.750 --> 00:22:07.350 align:middle line:90%
Well, he's what-- go--

00:22:07.350 --> 00:22:09.755 align:middle line:90%
>> Cats are smarter.

00:22:09.755 --> 00:22:14.520 align:middle line:84%
>> Now watch that the
implication is somebody who has

00:22:14.520 --> 00:22:17.120 align:middle line:84%
cats is smarter than
somebody has dogs, you see?

00:22:17.120 --> 00:22:18.270 align:middle line:90%
So-- right?

00:22:18.270 --> 00:22:21.510 align:middle line:84%
So we start listening
to the content

00:22:21.510 --> 00:22:24.910 align:middle line:90%
or context of the language.

00:22:24.910 --> 00:22:26.490 align:middle line:84%
One of the things
I discovered, and I

00:22:26.490 --> 00:22:32.760 align:middle line:84%
had to try to explain all this
to myself so I looked at time

00:22:32.760 --> 00:22:37.250 align:middle line:84%
and said, well, there's
18 divisions of time.

00:22:37.250 --> 00:22:40.590 align:middle line:84%
I just trying to break things
down rather than swallow

00:22:40.590 --> 00:22:42.420 align:middle line:90%
the whole cookie at once.

00:22:42.420 --> 00:22:44.550 align:middle line:84%
And then space, I
broke down into 8.

00:22:44.550 --> 00:22:45.600 align:middle line:90%
I only did that--

00:22:45.600 --> 00:22:48.600 align:middle line:84%
I call them aspects and time
as aspects, space as aspects.

00:22:48.600 --> 00:22:51.300 align:middle line:90%
I think that's totally true.

00:22:51.300 --> 00:22:52.800 align:middle line:84%
But then one of the
things I came up

00:22:52.800 --> 00:22:56.950 align:middle line:84%
with was, well, how many
dimensions does a human occupy?

00:22:56.950 --> 00:23:01.230 align:middle line:84%
And so one day I sat down
and started going through it.

00:23:01.230 --> 00:23:06.230 align:middle line:84%
And the answers I got was
like not 1, 2, 3, 4, 5.

00:23:06.230 --> 00:23:12.310 align:middle line:84%
It was like humans
are like 2 6 9 18, 31.

00:23:12.310 --> 00:23:14.640 align:middle line:84%
These numbers would
come up, right?

00:23:14.640 --> 00:23:15.890 align:middle line:90%
They come up in consciousness.

00:23:15.890 --> 00:23:17.557 align:middle line:84%
Kind of like when you
think of somebody,

00:23:17.557 --> 00:23:19.710 align:middle line:84%
remember, where do those
thoughts come from?

00:23:19.710 --> 00:23:22.950 align:middle line:84%
So I'm tapping into what's
called a field or information

00:23:22.950 --> 00:23:24.660 align:middle line:84%
field trying to find
that information.

00:23:24.660 --> 00:23:28.260 align:middle line:84%
No different than Tesla or any
other person has done that.

00:23:28.260 --> 00:23:32.010 align:middle line:90%
So I thought, well, humans--

00:23:32.010 --> 00:23:37.500 align:middle line:84%
what I came up with-- are
in about 23, 24 dimensions.

00:23:37.500 --> 00:23:40.650 align:middle line:84%
And being generous,
I wrote down 26

00:23:40.650 --> 00:23:42.180 align:middle line:84%
because I could
use the alphabet.

00:23:42.180 --> 00:23:44.490 align:middle line:84%
You see how I'm trying
to develop a system

00:23:44.490 --> 00:23:46.020 align:middle line:90%
to look at things?

00:23:46.020 --> 00:23:50.000 align:middle line:84%
And so-- but then
I thought, well,

00:23:50.000 --> 00:23:54.370 align:middle line:84%
how many do I share with
a cat or a dog or a horse?

00:23:54.370 --> 00:23:56.440 align:middle line:84%
Because what you
find is, humans have

00:23:56.440 --> 00:23:59.740 align:middle line:84%
an affinity for horses,
dog-- how many people

00:23:59.740 --> 00:24:01.300 align:middle line:90%
own horses here?

00:24:01.300 --> 00:24:02.170 align:middle line:90%
Anybody?

00:24:02.170 --> 00:24:03.160 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:24:03.160 --> 00:24:04.960 align:middle line:84%
So then I looked
at that and I found

00:24:04.960 --> 00:24:07.900 align:middle line:84%
that there was like,
say, a cat, let's say,

00:24:07.900 --> 00:24:11.500 align:middle line:84%
where we hold a
dimension number 12

00:24:11.500 --> 00:24:15.250 align:middle line:84%
and a cat holds
number 4, 9, 13, 17.

00:24:15.250 --> 00:24:19.660 align:middle line:90%
Well, I don't relate to that.

00:24:19.660 --> 00:24:22.640 align:middle line:84%
But you may be
stronger in number 12

00:24:22.640 --> 00:24:25.650 align:middle line:84%
and now you like cats because
they're strong in 12 or 13.

00:24:25.650 --> 00:24:26.650 align:middle line:90%
And you see what I mean?

00:24:26.650 --> 00:24:29.410 align:middle line:84%
We just try to
find those numbers.

00:24:29.410 --> 00:24:31.390 align:middle line:84%
What I found is
that humans share

00:24:31.390 --> 00:24:35.770 align:middle line:84%
with dogs about 7 different
dimensional interactions.

00:24:35.770 --> 00:24:39.430 align:middle line:84%
So we'd call that a
interdimensional interaction.

00:24:39.430 --> 00:24:41.560 align:middle line:84%
They're not occupying
the same space

00:24:41.560 --> 00:24:44.980 align:middle line:84%
that a human is because it's
a different consciousness.

00:24:44.980 --> 00:24:50.830 align:middle line:84%
And then I look at a cat and
I say, well, we only share 4.

00:24:50.830 --> 00:24:51.780 align:middle line:90%
>> Stupid cats.

00:24:51.780 --> 00:24:52.580 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:24:52.580 --> 00:24:56.350 align:middle line:90%


00:24:56.350 --> 00:24:59.440 align:middle line:84%
Not to pass judgment
on the dimensionality

00:24:59.440 --> 00:25:01.140 align:middle line:90%
of a cat or a dog.

00:25:01.140 --> 00:25:05.350 align:middle line:84%
But a horse is 4,
the same as a cat.

00:25:05.350 --> 00:25:06.880 align:middle line:84%
And so I started
going through this

00:25:06.880 --> 00:25:09.480 align:middle line:84%
like, why do people
have certain pets?

00:25:09.480 --> 00:25:11.560 align:middle line:90%
Well, you have affinity bonds.

00:25:11.560 --> 00:25:12.550 align:middle line:90%
You have resonance.

00:25:12.550 --> 00:25:15.400 align:middle line:84%
You share the same
dimensionality.

00:25:15.400 --> 00:25:16.880 align:middle line:90%
What does that mean?

00:25:16.880 --> 00:25:21.580 align:middle line:84%
Well, what if something came up
and showed up on your doorstep,

00:25:21.580 --> 00:25:25.840 align:middle line:84%
whether it was a
rhino or ET or--

00:25:25.840 --> 00:25:27.070 align:middle line:90%
you see what I mean?

00:25:27.070 --> 00:25:29.770 align:middle line:84%
You may not know
how to relate to it,

00:25:29.770 --> 00:25:33.760 align:middle line:84%
and you can't relate unless you
have a shared dimensionality.

00:25:33.760 --> 00:25:35.680 align:middle line:90%
Now, here comes the tricky part.

00:25:35.680 --> 00:25:38.770 align:middle line:84%
If you don't have that,
you can create that.

00:25:38.770 --> 00:25:41.080 align:middle line:90%
I can learn to like cats.

00:25:41.080 --> 00:25:44.110 align:middle line:90%
I can learn to like dogs, right?

00:25:44.110 --> 00:25:45.010 align:middle line:90%
Don't lie about it.

00:25:45.010 --> 00:25:48.040 align:middle line:90%


00:25:48.040 --> 00:25:50.570 align:middle line:84%
So you see, like, when we
come to the concept of ET

00:25:50.570 --> 00:25:54.580 align:middle line:84%
communication, well,
shared dimensionality,

00:25:54.580 --> 00:25:58.030 align:middle line:84%
well, you're kind of born with
that but you can add to them.

00:25:58.030 --> 00:26:01.360 align:middle line:84%
And I know this is
true because there

00:26:01.360 --> 00:26:05.650 align:middle line:84%
appears to be an evolutionary
process in dimensionality.

00:26:05.650 --> 00:26:10.360 align:middle line:84%
What I find-- I was born in
the decade of the '40s and most

00:26:10.360 --> 00:26:14.470 align:middle line:84%
people born, let's say, '30s,
'40s, somewhere in there,

00:26:14.470 --> 00:26:18.100 align:middle line:84%
only were born with about
16 to 18 dimensions.

00:26:18.100 --> 00:26:22.302 align:middle line:84%
And what you see today with the
children, we give words to it--

00:26:22.302 --> 00:26:23.260 align:middle line:90%
what do they call them?

00:26:23.260 --> 00:26:26.110 align:middle line:84%
Purple children, indigo,
something, right?

00:26:26.110 --> 00:26:28.040 align:middle line:90%
We give names to them.

00:26:28.040 --> 00:26:31.420 align:middle line:84%
And what I found when I
start working on it is like,

00:26:31.420 --> 00:26:35.260 align:middle line:84%
this child is showing up
with 21, 22 dimensions.

00:26:35.260 --> 00:26:38.140 align:middle line:84%
They know things,
ways that I don't.

00:26:38.140 --> 00:26:42.520 align:middle line:84%
They know things fast or they
don't relate in the same way.

00:26:42.520 --> 00:26:44.650 align:middle line:84%
And that extra
dimensionality gives them

00:26:44.650 --> 00:26:47.830 align:middle line:90%
an extra grasp on reality.

00:26:47.830 --> 00:26:50.740 align:middle line:84%
And the tricky part
is I've learned

00:26:50.740 --> 00:26:53.140 align:middle line:84%
that I could increase
my dimensionality

00:26:53.140 --> 00:26:56.950 align:middle line:84%
to match theirs as a way
to be able to communicate

00:26:56.950 --> 00:26:58.210 align:middle line:90%
with children.

00:26:58.210 --> 00:27:02.840 align:middle line:84%
Well, the same thing occurs
if we hit true ET race,

00:27:02.840 --> 00:27:05.440 align:middle line:84%
it shows up and wants
to be interactive,

00:27:05.440 --> 00:27:07.630 align:middle line:84%
they may have more
dimensionality or different

00:27:07.630 --> 00:27:09.980 align:middle line:84%
ones, just like your
cat or dog does.

00:27:09.980 --> 00:27:12.910 align:middle line:10%
And so it's not that
they're different.

00:27:12.910 --> 00:27:15.310 align:middle line:10%
It's that I need to
learn kind of like which

00:27:15.310 --> 00:27:19.750 align:middle line:10%
channel on the old CBs or
TV I need to change to,

00:27:19.750 --> 00:27:22.360 align:middle line:10%
and I need to learn to
communicate on that channel

00:27:22.360 --> 00:27:23.980 align:middle line:10%
or on that dimension.

00:27:23.980 --> 00:27:28.090 align:middle line:84%
And that's what truly
interdimensional work is.

00:27:28.090 --> 00:27:30.040 align:middle line:84%
Now, I grew up on
the reservation

00:27:30.040 --> 00:27:33.070 align:middle line:84%
out in Arizona, a
Navajo reservation.

00:27:33.070 --> 00:27:38.260 align:middle line:84%
And the ability or
interactions are much easier,

00:27:38.260 --> 00:27:39.670 align:middle line:90%
I will tell you that.

00:27:39.670 --> 00:27:43.060 align:middle line:84%
It's much easier to talk
to horses and dogs and cats

00:27:43.060 --> 00:27:48.470 align:middle line:84%
and plants and things that don't
have physical dimensionality.

00:27:48.470 --> 00:27:49.270 align:middle line:90%
All right.

00:27:49.270 --> 00:27:51.850 align:middle line:84%
So we call them disembodied
consciousness and welcome

00:27:51.850 --> 00:27:55.480 align:middle line:84%
to the world of ETs
and ghost and entities,

00:27:55.480 --> 00:27:58.690 align:middle line:84%
spirit attachments,
demons, angels,

00:27:58.690 --> 00:28:01.540 align:middle line:84%
[? ho'oponopono-ly ?] that
is described throughout

00:28:01.540 --> 00:28:02.350 align:middle line:90%
literature.

00:28:02.350 --> 00:28:04.630 align:middle line:90%
They're describing a reality.

00:28:04.630 --> 00:28:07.120 align:middle line:84%
But it may not be one
that you interact with,

00:28:07.120 --> 00:28:10.450 align:middle line:84%
just like you may own
a cat or own a dog.

00:28:10.450 --> 00:28:11.740 align:middle line:90%
Does that help?

00:28:11.740 --> 00:28:14.350 align:middle line:84%
You understand how
all this works, right?

00:28:14.350 --> 00:28:17.050 align:middle line:84%
But we're entering an
age where the potential

00:28:17.050 --> 00:28:21.850 align:middle line:84%
to have things or
people or ETs show up,

00:28:21.850 --> 00:28:24.970 align:middle line:84%
it's on us to develop
those communication skills,

00:28:24.970 --> 00:28:27.155 align:middle line:84%
to be open to that additional
dimensionality that

00:28:27.155 --> 00:28:27.955 align:middle line:90%
may be required.

00:28:27.955 --> 00:28:30.610 align:middle line:90%


00:28:30.610 --> 00:28:35.350 align:middle line:84%
>> Before we get
to the next topic,

00:28:35.350 --> 00:28:38.140 align:middle line:84%
I would like to answer a few
questions, if you do have,

00:28:38.140 --> 00:28:39.880 align:middle line:90%
on what we just covered.

00:28:39.880 --> 00:28:42.550 align:middle line:84%
We are going to be going into
a little bit different scenario

00:28:42.550 --> 00:28:43.390 align:middle line:90%
now.

00:28:43.390 --> 00:28:45.640 align:middle line:84%
So I'll take a
couple of questions.

00:28:45.640 --> 00:28:49.091 align:middle line:84%
>> I think every
alien has an agenda,

00:28:49.091 --> 00:28:52.318 align:middle line:90%
and I cannot discern that.

00:28:52.318 --> 00:28:56.130 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, first you
want to be aware of it,

00:28:56.130 --> 00:28:57.760 align:middle line:84%
which you are
aware of something.

00:28:57.760 --> 00:29:01.162 align:middle line:84%
Now where-- as Randy said,
where did that come from?

00:29:01.162 --> 00:29:02.230 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:29:02.230 --> 00:29:03.950 align:middle line:90%
Or where does it exist at?

00:29:03.950 --> 00:29:06.610 align:middle line:90%


00:29:06.610 --> 00:29:10.040 align:middle line:84%
When people have interactions,
like say there's an agenda,

00:29:10.040 --> 00:29:14.110 align:middle line:84%
what do you have that would
be desirable on their side?

00:29:14.110 --> 00:29:16.120 align:middle line:90%
The answer is you have energy.

00:29:16.120 --> 00:29:17.170 align:middle line:90%
You have life force.

00:29:17.170 --> 00:29:19.870 align:middle line:84%
The way I teach it is
you're born with the ability

00:29:19.870 --> 00:29:22.700 align:middle line:84%
to have energy flow
through your system.

00:29:22.700 --> 00:29:24.250 align:middle line:90%
It comes in this way.

00:29:24.250 --> 00:29:26.980 align:middle line:84%
It comes in through
the cycle and combines

00:29:26.980 --> 00:29:29.320 align:middle line:84%
and goes out that
way, let's say.

00:29:29.320 --> 00:29:31.630 align:middle line:84%
And really, you shouldn't
block because-- well, this

00:29:31.630 --> 00:29:34.570 align:middle line:84%
is where we get all this
heart math and heart

00:29:34.570 --> 00:29:36.370 align:middle line:90%
chakra and everything.

00:29:36.370 --> 00:29:40.900 align:middle line:84%
Because if you invert
this, it's called grief.

00:29:40.900 --> 00:29:44.920 align:middle line:84%
It's a horrible feeling and
experience of the human body

00:29:44.920 --> 00:29:47.170 align:middle line:90%
to invert the heart energy.

00:29:47.170 --> 00:29:49.600 align:middle line:84%
And you see it on the
movie where somebody--

00:29:49.600 --> 00:29:53.170 align:middle line:84%
tornado or accident and
they collapse around it.

00:29:53.170 --> 00:29:53.970 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:29:53.970 --> 00:29:56.898 align:middle line:84%
That's an inversion
of the energy field.

00:29:56.898 --> 00:29:58.690 align:middle line:84%
So in a way we're
explaining what grief is.

00:29:58.690 --> 00:30:04.000 align:middle line:84%
It's an inversion of the energy
field from the heart center.

00:30:04.000 --> 00:30:06.692 align:middle line:84%
But if somebody comes
up to you and goes,

00:30:06.692 --> 00:30:08.650 align:middle line:84%
well, blah, blah blah,
and I had a horrible day

00:30:08.650 --> 00:30:10.275 align:middle line:84%
and the traffic was
bad and blah, blah.

00:30:10.275 --> 00:30:12.460 align:middle line:90%
That's an energy vampire.

00:30:12.460 --> 00:30:14.830 align:middle line:84%
So you sit there like this
and just like the bottle

00:30:14.830 --> 00:30:17.740 align:middle line:90%
it just starts draining.

00:30:17.740 --> 00:30:20.810 align:middle line:84%
And they walk away and
you're worn out and tired

00:30:20.810 --> 00:30:21.610 align:middle line:90%
and no energy.

00:30:21.610 --> 00:30:23.193 align:middle line:84%
And they're like,
oh, good to see you.

00:30:23.193 --> 00:30:24.790 align:middle line:90%
See you tomorrow.

00:30:24.790 --> 00:30:27.550 align:middle line:90%
We'll go again.

00:30:27.550 --> 00:30:31.480 align:middle line:84%
So we want to be able
to maintain ourselves.

00:30:31.480 --> 00:30:34.090 align:middle line:10%
And anybody that
has had nightmares,

00:30:34.090 --> 00:30:37.690 align:middle line:10%
they wake up without energy.

00:30:37.690 --> 00:30:40.720 align:middle line:10%
Well, where did it go?

00:30:40.720 --> 00:30:42.460 align:middle line:10%
And one of the
things I've found is

00:30:42.460 --> 00:30:45.640 align:middle line:10%
that people would have entity
spirit attaches demons,

00:30:45.640 --> 00:30:48.970 align:middle line:10%
non conscious
entities, non-physical,

00:30:48.970 --> 00:30:53.220 align:middle line:10%
it goes on forever and there's
always been names for it.

00:30:53.220 --> 00:30:56.890 align:middle line:84%
They do not have
physical bodies,

00:30:56.890 --> 00:30:59.530 align:middle line:90%
need energy, just like we do.

00:30:59.530 --> 00:31:01.840 align:middle line:84%
And they tend to
get it from humans.

00:31:01.840 --> 00:31:03.670 align:middle line:84%
And if anybody wants
to understand it

00:31:03.670 --> 00:31:06.490 align:middle line:84%
exactly and the
science behind it,

00:31:06.490 --> 00:31:09.710 align:middle line:84%
they should watch
"Monsters, Inc," right?

00:31:09.710 --> 00:31:10.510 align:middle line:90%
"Monsters, Inc."

00:31:10.510 --> 00:31:13.660 align:middle line:84%
explains perfectly
that joyfulness,

00:31:13.660 --> 00:31:16.120 align:middle line:84%
which is what I teach,
that joyfulness,

00:31:16.120 --> 00:31:18.070 align:middle line:84%
as a level of consciousness,
is the only way

00:31:18.070 --> 00:31:21.340 align:middle line:90%
to go through the world.

00:31:21.340 --> 00:31:23.830 align:middle line:84%
Dr. David Hawkins-- I invite
everybody to read a book

00:31:23.830 --> 00:31:25.840 align:middle line:90%
called "Power Versus Force."

00:31:25.840 --> 00:31:30.260 align:middle line:84%
And 540 is the
level of joyfulness.

00:31:30.260 --> 00:31:33.370 align:middle line:84%
As a religious reference
in the Bible, it says,

00:31:33.370 --> 00:31:36.880 align:middle line:84%
be joyful until the Lord--
or be joyful into the world.

00:31:36.880 --> 00:31:40.550 align:middle line:84%
And you don't think
about, every morning,

00:31:40.550 --> 00:31:42.610 align:middle line:90%
that's how I'm going to start.

00:31:42.610 --> 00:31:44.960 align:middle line:90%
It's not going to last, right?

00:31:44.960 --> 00:31:45.760 align:middle line:90%
[CHUCKLES]

00:31:45.760 --> 00:31:48.300 align:middle line:84%
But I'm going to start
every day by being joyful.

00:31:48.300 --> 00:31:49.533 align:middle line:90%
That's a high vibration.

00:31:49.533 --> 00:31:51.700 align:middle line:84%
And people are going to
either want to be around you

00:31:51.700 --> 00:31:53.120 align:middle line:90%
or take your energy.

00:31:53.120 --> 00:31:56.560 align:middle line:84%
And at 5:00 o'clock or whatever,
you turn around, come back,

00:31:56.560 --> 00:31:58.930 align:middle line:90%
and go, I'm joyful again.

00:31:58.930 --> 00:32:01.660 align:middle line:90%
Because it's-- right?

00:32:01.660 --> 00:32:04.270 align:middle line:84%
But the more you
can hold 540, you'll

00:32:04.270 --> 00:32:07.250 align:middle line:84%
find less and less that
you'd lose your energy,

00:32:07.250 --> 00:32:10.000 align:middle line:84%
or that you have
nightmares, or that people

00:32:10.000 --> 00:32:12.850 align:middle line:84%
want to take your energy,
because they literally

00:32:12.850 --> 00:32:15.220 align:middle line:84%
can't stand to be around
you because you're

00:32:15.220 --> 00:32:18.920 align:middle line:84%
too happy and too
busy being yourself.

00:32:18.920 --> 00:32:20.650 align:middle line:90%
So that's how it works.

00:32:20.650 --> 00:32:22.540 align:middle line:84%
If you have low energy,
it's easy for them

00:32:22.540 --> 00:32:23.920 align:middle line:90%
to take your energy.

00:32:23.920 --> 00:32:25.878 align:middle line:84%
If you have high energy,
it's harder for people

00:32:25.878 --> 00:32:26.678 align:middle line:90%
to take you energy.

00:32:26.678 --> 00:32:28.240 align:middle line:84%
You're like, I don't
care about that.

00:32:28.240 --> 00:32:31.680 align:middle line:84%
Or somebody bumps you
or something, right?

00:32:31.680 --> 00:32:34.810 align:middle line:84%
>> And also, you can
probably explain, too,

00:32:34.810 --> 00:32:37.270 align:middle line:84%
if you think about it
too much, and fester,

00:32:37.270 --> 00:32:39.060 align:middle line:84%
you're actually
hurting yourself.

00:32:39.060 --> 00:32:40.570 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:32:40.570 --> 00:32:46.270 align:middle line:84%
We have a horrible problem as
humans, and it's called memory.

00:32:46.270 --> 00:32:51.250 align:middle line:84%
I don't invite people to bring
up a negative memory, OK?

00:32:51.250 --> 00:32:55.270 align:middle line:84%
It's a horrible thing to do
to somebody, because you're

00:32:55.270 --> 00:32:57.400 align:middle line:90%
asking them to repeat it.

00:32:57.400 --> 00:32:59.680 align:middle line:84%
And the way the
human mind works is,

00:32:59.680 --> 00:33:03.700 align:middle line:84%
if I repeat a negative
experience, I re-experience it.

00:33:03.700 --> 00:33:07.840 align:middle line:84%
And now I'm engraving
my neural pathways

00:33:07.840 --> 00:33:09.880 align:middle line:90%
to support that memory.

00:33:09.880 --> 00:33:11.350 align:middle line:84%
But one of the
things I found out

00:33:11.350 --> 00:33:14.500 align:middle line:84%
was that memory
is mutable, right?

00:33:14.500 --> 00:33:18.220 align:middle line:84%
What were you wearing
at dinner two years ago

00:33:18.220 --> 00:33:19.930 align:middle line:90%
at this restaurant?

00:33:19.930 --> 00:33:21.880 align:middle line:10%
I can't answer that.

00:33:21.880 --> 00:33:24.760 align:middle line:10%
My girlfriend can
tell you exactly,

00:33:24.760 --> 00:33:27.240 align:middle line:10%
I mean who ordered what.

00:33:27.240 --> 00:33:28.990 align:middle line:90%
She has that kind of memory.

00:33:28.990 --> 00:33:30.100 align:middle line:90%
I have a different memory.

00:33:30.100 --> 00:33:32.270 align:middle line:84%
It's more related
to science fiction

00:33:32.270 --> 00:33:35.380 align:middle line:90%
and every book I've ever read.

00:33:35.380 --> 00:33:39.530 align:middle line:84%
But what happens is we take
a memory and we energize it.

00:33:39.530 --> 00:33:40.580 align:middle line:90%
And we want to--

00:33:40.580 --> 00:33:43.850 align:middle line:84%
literally, at the end of the
day, I didn't do anything,

00:33:43.850 --> 00:33:46.250 align:middle line:84%
I don't remember anything,
I got rid of all that,

00:33:46.250 --> 00:33:48.740 align:middle line:84%
because now I'm
finally back home.

00:33:48.740 --> 00:33:50.090 align:middle line:90%
You see what I just did?

00:33:50.090 --> 00:33:52.100 align:middle line:84%
I can come back up
to being myself,

00:33:52.100 --> 00:33:54.620 align:middle line:84%
and I can now think
about what I want to do

00:33:54.620 --> 00:33:56.750 align:middle line:90%
or what I want to enjoy.

00:33:56.750 --> 00:33:59.810 align:middle line:90%
And there's that joy word again.

00:33:59.810 --> 00:34:02.600 align:middle line:84%
So rather than try to
fight it or anything--

00:34:02.600 --> 00:34:04.070 align:middle line:84%
like in martial
arts, we don't try

00:34:04.070 --> 00:34:07.490 align:middle line:84%
to defend after six
months, that way I teach.

00:34:07.490 --> 00:34:09.780 align:middle line:84%
We turn around and
attack the problem.

00:34:09.780 --> 00:34:12.110 align:middle line:84%
Which means I start
out like this,

00:34:12.110 --> 00:34:15.190 align:middle line:84%
I come home like this,
take a deep breath,

00:34:15.190 --> 00:34:16.757 align:middle line:90%
OK, let's go again.

00:34:16.757 --> 00:34:18.590 align:middle line:84%
Only this time I'm going
to go the way I do.

00:34:18.590 --> 00:34:22.040 align:middle line:84%
That is literally
the simplest process.

00:34:22.040 --> 00:34:23.840 align:middle line:84%
You didn't have to
pay a million dollars.

00:34:23.840 --> 00:34:26.010 align:middle line:84%
You didn't have to go to
a guru or go to India.

00:34:26.010 --> 00:34:26.810 align:middle line:90%
It works.

00:34:26.810 --> 00:34:28.310 align:middle line:84%
I can tell you it
works because I've

00:34:28.310 --> 00:34:30.170 align:middle line:90%
taught it to 1,000 students.

00:34:30.170 --> 00:34:32.699 align:middle line:84%
And no matter what
goes on in their life,

00:34:32.699 --> 00:34:34.940 align:middle line:84%
they can come back
to being themselves.

00:34:34.940 --> 00:34:36.889 align:middle line:90%
And that's what we want.

00:34:36.889 --> 00:34:39.830 align:middle line:84%
And we drop the experience
because we don't want

00:34:39.830 --> 00:34:42.350 align:middle line:90%
to enhance a negative memory.

00:34:42.350 --> 00:34:47.300 align:middle line:84%
So real quick, you sit down
and go, I'm not 60 years old,

00:34:47.300 --> 00:34:50.389 align:middle line:84%
I'm not 59, you just
work your way backwards,

00:34:50.389 --> 00:34:53.630 align:middle line:84%
and then you work your way
back up when you get to 0.

00:34:53.630 --> 00:34:56.212 align:middle line:84%
You go 0, now I'm 1
year old and I'm happy--

00:34:56.212 --> 00:34:57.170 align:middle line:90%
and you'd be surprised.

00:34:57.170 --> 00:34:57.970 align:middle line:90%
You work your way--

00:34:57.970 --> 00:35:01.030 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I can give you the
full meditation some time,

00:35:01.030 --> 00:35:02.810 align:middle line:90%
or you watch online.

00:35:02.810 --> 00:35:05.960 align:middle line:84%
But these simple
techniques don't

00:35:05.960 --> 00:35:10.250 align:middle line:84%
require outside influences,
outside authorities.

00:35:10.250 --> 00:35:13.280 align:middle line:84%
I want everybody to be
independently able to take care

00:35:13.280 --> 00:35:15.190 align:middle line:90%
of themselves energetically.

00:35:15.190 --> 00:35:18.105 align:middle line:90%


00:35:18.105 --> 00:35:19.270 align:middle line:10%
>> Yes, sir.

00:35:19.270 --> 00:35:22.580 align:middle line:84%
>> Since we're kind of
on the subject again,

00:35:22.580 --> 00:35:25.790 align:middle line:84%
is there a method that you
guys use to kind of truth-test

00:35:25.790 --> 00:35:27.862 align:middle line:90%
the validity of your own memory?

00:35:27.862 --> 00:35:31.070 align:middle line:84%
And if you do, I mean, would
it even be valid to do so,

00:35:31.070 --> 00:35:33.890 align:middle line:84%
or just to go back and recreate
it the way that you want?

00:35:33.890 --> 00:35:37.020 align:middle line:10%
Or is it even necessary
to go back and even

00:35:37.020 --> 00:35:41.120 align:middle line:10%
try to just go back and change
it to the way we want it?

00:35:41.120 --> 00:35:43.140 align:middle line:90%
>> Manifestation.

00:35:43.140 --> 00:35:44.760 align:middle line:84%
This is a
manifestation question.

00:35:44.760 --> 00:35:45.560 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:35:45.560 --> 00:35:49.510 align:middle line:10%
>> And you are
programmed already--

00:35:49.510 --> 00:35:54.310 align:middle line:10%
the way you were raised, the
way you think, the way you

00:35:54.310 --> 00:35:55.780 align:middle line:10%
experience your life daily.

00:35:55.780 --> 00:35:58.270 align:middle line:90%
You get into a routine.

00:35:58.270 --> 00:36:03.950 align:middle line:84%
And it repeats itself, which
can block the truth from you.

00:36:03.950 --> 00:36:05.150 align:middle line:90%
>> I agree.

00:36:05.150 --> 00:36:07.370 align:middle line:84%
>> And that's the biggest
problem out there,

00:36:07.370 --> 00:36:09.540 align:middle line:90%
especially with the media.

00:36:09.540 --> 00:36:12.340 align:middle line:84%
You know, as we walk
through the airport,

00:36:12.340 --> 00:36:14.035 align:middle line:84%
I mean, they're
blasting it in screens,

00:36:14.035 --> 00:36:16.160 align:middle line:84%
and everyone's on their
phone, watching this, that,

00:36:16.160 --> 00:36:16.960 align:middle line:90%
and the other.

00:36:16.960 --> 00:36:21.190 align:middle line:10%
And we tend to believe
everything that we read,

00:36:21.190 --> 00:36:26.660 align:middle line:10%
and see, and hear, because
there's only really one entity

00:36:26.660 --> 00:36:29.780 align:middle line:10%
that's doing it, to be honest,
even though we have ABC, CBS,

00:36:29.780 --> 00:36:32.180 align:middle line:10%
and all these different--

00:36:32.180 --> 00:36:34.700 align:middle line:10%
But to get the truth out
of it, you really then

00:36:34.700 --> 00:36:37.850 align:middle line:10%
have to tap down deep inside.

00:36:37.850 --> 00:36:42.080 align:middle line:84%
And you have to access this
field that Randy talks about.

00:36:42.080 --> 00:36:44.240 align:middle line:84%
Because if you're
doing this and trying

00:36:44.240 --> 00:36:49.000 align:middle line:84%
to judge me right
now with your brain,

00:36:49.000 --> 00:36:52.430 align:middle line:84%
your brain's just going to
come up to what you believe in.

00:36:52.430 --> 00:36:58.616 align:middle line:84%
But the truth lies here
inside you, in your heart.

00:36:58.616 --> 00:37:01.330 align:middle line:10%
You can add to--

00:37:01.330 --> 00:37:07.480 align:middle line:10%
>> Yeah, people, I've
found, for the most part,

00:37:07.480 --> 00:37:09.340 align:middle line:10%
don't self-examine.

00:37:09.340 --> 00:37:12.330 align:middle line:90%
That's what it's called.

00:37:12.330 --> 00:37:16.710 align:middle line:84%
But people will tell you,
I'm a particular religion,

00:37:16.710 --> 00:37:20.610 align:middle line:84%
or a particular
socioeconomic class.

00:37:20.610 --> 00:37:24.960 align:middle line:84%
And I use the example, if you
tell me where you're born,

00:37:24.960 --> 00:37:27.300 align:middle line:84%
I'll tell you what
your religion is.

00:37:27.300 --> 00:37:28.800 align:middle line:84%
You tell me when
you were born, I'll

00:37:28.800 --> 00:37:31.338 align:middle line:90%
tell you your economic status.

00:37:31.338 --> 00:37:32.880 align:middle line:84%
And they're like,
how do you do that?

00:37:32.880 --> 00:37:37.830 align:middle line:84%
Because it's what is referred
to as a morphic field.

00:37:37.830 --> 00:37:40.110 align:middle line:84%
So everybody born
in Utah, everybody

00:37:40.110 --> 00:37:42.060 align:middle line:90%
born in Iraq, everybody born--

00:37:42.060 --> 00:37:43.890 align:middle line:84%
we can make
definitive statements.

00:37:43.890 --> 00:37:45.440 align:middle line:84%
And they go, oh,
no, I know somebody.

00:37:45.440 --> 00:37:48.210 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, well, there's
always exceptions.

00:37:48.210 --> 00:37:50.370 align:middle line:84%
There's always exceptions
to level of intelligence,

00:37:50.370 --> 00:37:52.890 align:middle line:84%
level of IQ, level
of everything.

00:37:52.890 --> 00:37:56.830 align:middle line:84%
But as a rule, where you
grew up is your programming.

00:37:56.830 --> 00:37:59.130 align:middle line:90%
It's environmental programming.

00:37:59.130 --> 00:38:01.620 align:middle line:84%
All the people in
there are cohesive

00:38:01.620 --> 00:38:04.110 align:middle line:84%
in the elementary
school you went to,

00:38:04.110 --> 00:38:07.080 align:middle line:84%
or the church you went
to, or the political group

00:38:07.080 --> 00:38:08.040 align:middle line:90%
you went to.

00:38:08.040 --> 00:38:09.750 align:middle line:90%
That's all programming.

00:38:09.750 --> 00:38:12.090 align:middle line:90%
And we're strange creatures.

00:38:12.090 --> 00:38:15.570 align:middle line:84%
Once we have programming, we
tend to never question it.

00:38:15.570 --> 00:38:18.840 align:middle line:84%
And when we do we have
to call it in question,

00:38:18.840 --> 00:38:24.410 align:middle line:84%
it's usually through pain,
through a painful experience.

00:38:24.410 --> 00:38:27.180 align:middle line:84%
To love and to hold
till death do us part--

00:38:27.180 --> 00:38:29.730 align:middle line:90%
you see what I mean?

00:38:29.730 --> 00:38:32.390 align:middle line:84%
The statistics would
imply that there

00:38:32.390 --> 00:38:34.670 align:middle line:84%
should be either a whole
lot more dead people--

00:38:34.670 --> 00:38:37.026 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:38:37.026 --> 00:38:38.086 align:middle line:90%


00:38:38.086 --> 00:38:43.190 align:middle line:84%
--or there may be some
problem with that program, OK?

00:38:43.190 --> 00:38:48.740 align:middle line:84%
And so that's an extreme
example, we could say.

00:38:48.740 --> 00:38:53.540 align:middle line:84%
But it is no less so for
basically everything you do.

00:38:53.540 --> 00:38:55.820 align:middle line:84%
And so sometimes I
invite people to,

00:38:55.820 --> 00:38:58.850 align:middle line:84%
like, what would you
like to drink today?

00:38:58.850 --> 00:39:02.210 align:middle line:84%
Coffee, tea, wine, it
doesn't make a difference.

00:39:02.210 --> 00:39:04.730 align:middle line:84%
But then, if I'm
being mean, I'll

00:39:04.730 --> 00:39:07.610 align:middle line:90%
say, why do you drink that?

00:39:07.610 --> 00:39:09.720 align:middle line:84%
And people are like,
well, because it's good,

00:39:09.720 --> 00:39:12.470 align:middle line:84%
or-- here we go
with the intellect.

00:39:12.470 --> 00:39:15.590 align:middle line:84%
But the truth of the
matter is, and should be,

00:39:15.590 --> 00:39:18.020 align:middle line:90%
because I choose to.

00:39:18.020 --> 00:39:21.082 align:middle line:84%
Because if you say, I choose
to, there is no argument.

00:39:21.082 --> 00:39:22.790 align:middle line:84%
I mean, well, I can
argue with it-- well,

00:39:22.790 --> 00:39:25.950 align:middle line:84%
you shouldn't choose that,
or yeah, here we go again.

00:39:25.950 --> 00:39:28.250 align:middle line:84%
But now we're in that
negative thought process,

00:39:28.250 --> 00:39:30.150 align:middle line:90%
trying to alter your behavior.

00:39:30.150 --> 00:39:35.330 align:middle line:84%
So I tell people, take time,
and start choosing everything

00:39:35.330 --> 00:39:39.380 align:middle line:84%
about what you do, and how
you act, and how you look.

00:39:39.380 --> 00:39:41.630 align:middle line:84%
And it's not just
choosing, but it's

00:39:41.630 --> 00:39:43.820 align:middle line:84%
what we call "I want
to lose weight."

00:39:43.820 --> 00:39:44.870 align:middle line:90%
Welcome to the club.

00:39:44.870 --> 00:39:46.670 align:middle line:90%
[AUDIENCE CHUCKLES]

00:39:46.670 --> 00:39:49.640 align:middle line:10%
But am I willing to lose weight.

00:39:49.640 --> 00:39:52.040 align:middle line:90%
Now that's a different game.

00:39:52.040 --> 00:39:56.930 align:middle line:84%
I want to change how I am
or how people react to me.

00:39:56.930 --> 00:39:58.700 align:middle line:84%
Well, you can find
ways to do that.

00:39:58.700 --> 00:40:01.130 align:middle line:84%
There's a million
books on any of this.

00:40:01.130 --> 00:40:02.790 align:middle line:90%
But it's not just wanting to.

00:40:02.790 --> 00:40:04.510 align:middle line:10%
Wanting to is very weak.

00:40:04.510 --> 00:40:09.420 align:middle line:10%
Desire is very weak at a certain
level, but more pervasive.

00:40:09.420 --> 00:40:12.320 align:middle line:84%
It's probably the
dominating emotion

00:40:12.320 --> 00:40:14.510 align:middle line:90%
and human activity is desire.

00:40:14.510 --> 00:40:15.900 align:middle line:10%
We don't think about that.

00:40:15.900 --> 00:40:18.330 align:middle line:90%
But you want to go shopping?

00:40:18.330 --> 00:40:19.130 align:middle line:90%
See what I mean?

00:40:19.130 --> 00:40:20.480 align:middle line:90%
It's, like, instant.

00:40:20.480 --> 00:40:21.380 align:middle line:90%
You want food?

00:40:21.380 --> 00:40:22.310 align:middle line:90%
That's desire.

00:40:22.310 --> 00:40:23.360 align:middle line:90%
You want a relationship?

00:40:23.360 --> 00:40:24.570 align:middle line:90%
That's desire.

00:40:24.570 --> 00:40:26.030 align:middle line:90%
It's in all the movies.

00:40:26.030 --> 00:40:28.130 align:middle line:90%
It's the major one they use.

00:40:28.130 --> 00:40:31.460 align:middle line:84%
And yet desire only
calibrates at about,

00:40:31.460 --> 00:40:34.390 align:middle line:84%
I don't know, 190, 180,
something like that,

00:40:34.390 --> 00:40:37.080 align:middle line:90%
in Hawkins' scale in his book.

00:40:37.080 --> 00:40:39.890 align:middle line:84%
And so it's what we
call nonintegrous.

00:40:39.890 --> 00:40:43.710 align:middle line:84%
In other words, it's going to
be a negative drain on you.

00:40:43.710 --> 00:40:45.560 align:middle line:84%
And of course what we
find, we go shopping

00:40:45.560 --> 00:40:47.900 align:middle line:90%
and it doesn't satisfy us.

00:40:47.900 --> 00:40:49.490 align:middle line:90%
Actually, it does satisfy us.

00:40:49.490 --> 00:40:52.210 align:middle line:10%
But satisfaction is short term.

00:40:52.210 --> 00:40:55.400 align:middle line:10%
Fulfillment-- I never have
to buy another pair of shoes,

00:40:55.400 --> 00:41:00.530 align:middle line:10%
or I never have to buy another
stove, or whatever it is.

00:41:00.530 --> 00:41:02.480 align:middle line:84%
So those subtle
differences are things

00:41:02.480 --> 00:41:04.010 align:middle line:90%
we start exploring on our own.

00:41:04.010 --> 00:41:07.490 align:middle line:84%
We really don't need
anybody else to do it with.

00:41:07.490 --> 00:41:09.260 align:middle line:90%
It's why am I tall?

00:41:09.260 --> 00:41:10.160 align:middle line:90%
Why am I short?

00:41:10.160 --> 00:41:11.120 align:middle line:90%
Why am I Mormon?

00:41:11.120 --> 00:41:12.340 align:middle line:90%
Why am I Christian?

00:41:12.340 --> 00:41:13.140 align:middle line:90%
Why am I Muslim?

00:41:13.140 --> 00:41:14.830 align:middle line:90%
Why am I a banker?

00:41:14.830 --> 00:41:16.370 align:middle line:90%
Why am I-- right?

00:41:16.370 --> 00:41:19.520 align:middle line:84%
And most people, it's
because I didn't choose that.

00:41:19.520 --> 00:41:20.330 align:middle line:90%
I grew up with it.

00:41:20.330 --> 00:41:21.470 align:middle line:90%
That's what we say.

00:41:21.470 --> 00:41:22.970 align:middle line:90%
Well, that's like your memories.

00:41:22.970 --> 00:41:24.590 align:middle line:84%
Your memories are
being deposited

00:41:24.590 --> 00:41:26.480 align:middle line:90%
based on that programming.

00:41:26.480 --> 00:41:28.850 align:middle line:90%
And everybody has programming.

00:41:28.850 --> 00:41:30.500 align:middle line:90%
Just get over it.

00:41:30.500 --> 00:41:32.720 align:middle line:84%
But negative programming
is different,

00:41:32.720 --> 00:41:36.740 align:middle line:84%
because negative programming
is what holds us in place.

00:41:36.740 --> 00:41:39.320 align:middle line:10%
And once you start
trying to work it like,

00:41:39.320 --> 00:41:43.520 align:middle line:10%
I don't need to do
that anymore, then you

00:41:43.520 --> 00:41:46.740 align:middle line:10%
can move yourself forward
mentally, physically,

00:41:46.740 --> 00:41:49.700 align:middle line:10%
emotionally, spiritually,
psychically, psychologically,

00:41:49.700 --> 00:41:50.960 align:middle line:10%
and on and on and on.

00:41:50.960 --> 00:41:52.640 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:41:52.640 --> 00:41:54.833 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:41:54.833 --> 00:41:56.000 align:middle line:90%
>> Any more-- on dimensions?

00:41:56.000 --> 00:41:56.230 align:middle line:90%
>> Right here.

00:41:56.230 --> 00:41:57.360 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, I'm sorry.

00:41:57.360 --> 00:41:58.680 align:middle line:90%
>> Are you Mormon?

00:41:58.680 --> 00:41:59.480 align:middle line:10%
>> No.

00:41:59.480 --> 00:42:00.990 align:middle line:10%
I wasn't born in--

00:42:00.990 --> 00:42:03.410 align:middle line:10%
the better question would
be, were you born in Utah?

00:42:03.410 --> 00:42:05.030 align:middle line:90%
>> Were you born in Utah?

00:42:05.030 --> 00:42:06.140 align:middle line:90%
>> Do you see what I mean?

00:42:06.140 --> 00:42:07.080 align:middle line:90%
>> Were you born in Utah?

00:42:07.080 --> 00:42:07.880 align:middle line:90%
>> No.

00:42:07.880 --> 00:42:09.407 align:middle line:90%
But do you understand?

00:42:09.407 --> 00:42:11.740 align:middle line:10%
>> I was going to say, if you
are, I'm more like Moroni,

00:42:11.740 --> 00:42:13.630 align:middle line:10%
the guy on top of your
temple, blowing the trumpet,

00:42:13.630 --> 00:42:14.660 align:middle line:10%
like the whistleblower.

00:42:14.660 --> 00:42:15.940 align:middle line:90%
That's more like me.

00:42:15.940 --> 00:42:18.260 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:42:18.260 --> 00:42:20.150 align:middle line:90%
I had the fortune--

00:42:20.150 --> 00:42:24.620 align:middle line:84%
or misfortune-- of being
raised in the valley

00:42:24.620 --> 00:42:29.750 align:middle line:84%
here, Sherman Oaks, and Thousand
Oaks, and all up and down.

00:42:29.750 --> 00:42:32.390 align:middle line:10%
And then in Oklahoma
on a reservation,

00:42:32.390 --> 00:42:35.750 align:middle line:10%
and then in Arizona
on a reservation.

00:42:35.750 --> 00:42:37.730 align:middle line:10%
And the constant
moving and stuff

00:42:37.730 --> 00:42:40.040 align:middle line:10%
didn't give me one program.

00:42:40.040 --> 00:42:43.040 align:middle line:10%
So I was not attached to one.

00:42:43.040 --> 00:42:46.250 align:middle line:10%
What I developed as a skill
is to adopt another one

00:42:46.250 --> 00:42:49.610 align:middle line:10%
without much damage or baggage.

00:42:49.610 --> 00:42:54.770 align:middle line:10%
It's frightening how hard
you will hold onto weight,

00:42:54.770 --> 00:42:56.900 align:middle line:10%
how hold you will
how hard you will

00:42:56.900 --> 00:43:01.430 align:middle line:10%
hold onto a program of the
way you are, the way you look,

00:43:01.430 --> 00:43:03.290 align:middle line:10%
or the way you think.

00:43:03.290 --> 00:43:06.290 align:middle line:10%
You can see that in
our political systems,

00:43:06.290 --> 00:43:08.960 align:middle line:10%
religious systems,
just communities.

00:43:08.960 --> 00:43:10.375 align:middle line:10%
"You're not from here."

00:43:10.375 --> 00:43:11.220 align:middle line:10%
[CHUCKLES]

00:43:11.220 --> 00:43:13.070 align:middle line:10%
And it's just all over.

00:43:13.070 --> 00:43:15.880 align:middle line:10%
And so we want to
dampen that down.

00:43:15.880 --> 00:43:20.270 align:middle line:10%
We want to lessen its impact and
control over our physical body,

00:43:20.270 --> 00:43:22.190 align:middle line:10%
and then over our thinking.

00:43:22.190 --> 00:43:26.130 align:middle line:10%
We want to be more open-minded.

00:43:26.130 --> 00:43:28.890 align:middle line:84%
Back in the '90s,
there was a conference.

00:43:28.890 --> 00:43:32.310 align:middle line:84%
And the latest
information came out.

00:43:32.310 --> 00:43:33.900 align:middle line:84%
There were more than
four dimensions.

00:43:33.900 --> 00:43:35.700 align:middle line:90%
There were 11.

00:43:35.700 --> 00:43:40.050 align:middle line:84%
And one of the scientists
that was presenting--

00:43:40.050 --> 00:43:44.235 align:middle line:84%
like you, I stood up and go,
I can count higher than that.

00:43:44.235 --> 00:43:45.450 align:middle line:90%
[CHUCKLES]

00:43:45.450 --> 00:43:48.540 align:middle line:90%
And they didn't like me, OK?

00:43:48.540 --> 00:43:52.620 align:middle line:10%
Because I'd already come to
the conclusion that, you know,

00:43:52.620 --> 00:43:56.970 align:middle line:10%
heighth, and width, and depth,
and time, now we have what

00:43:56.970 --> 00:43:59.490 align:middle line:10%
I refer to as
number one reality.

00:43:59.490 --> 00:44:02.650 align:middle line:10%
The physical reality is
the number one reality.

00:44:02.650 --> 00:44:05.100 align:middle line:10%
But when you close
your eyes, you

00:44:05.100 --> 00:44:07.800 align:middle line:10%
can see, and be,
and hear all kinds

00:44:07.800 --> 00:44:12.630 align:middle line:10%
of things that don't
appear when I open my eyes.

00:44:12.630 --> 00:44:15.480 align:middle line:84%
So anybody who's
ever had dream states

00:44:15.480 --> 00:44:17.860 align:middle line:84%
has experienced
different realities,

00:44:17.860 --> 00:44:20.400 align:middle line:84%
only now we're going
to interchange that

00:44:20.400 --> 00:44:23.910 align:middle line:90%
with a language of dimensions.

00:44:23.910 --> 00:44:26.720 align:middle line:84%
So we can have
dimensional interference.

00:44:26.720 --> 00:44:27.520 align:middle line:90%
What's that mean?

00:44:27.520 --> 00:44:30.270 align:middle line:84%
There's a 5G wave flowing
through this room.

00:44:30.270 --> 00:44:33.360 align:middle line:84%
We don't have any way
to relate to that.

00:44:33.360 --> 00:44:34.860 align:middle line:84%
But we could say,
well, that comes

00:44:34.860 --> 00:44:39.300 align:middle line:84%
through another dimension,
another layer of interaction,

00:44:39.300 --> 00:44:41.460 align:middle line:84%
which is actually
a better language.

00:44:41.460 --> 00:44:44.640 align:middle line:84%
So even dimensions is
the wrong language.

00:44:44.640 --> 00:44:46.560 align:middle line:84%
We should say there
are intersections

00:44:46.560 --> 00:44:50.100 align:middle line:90%
of energy and information flow.

00:44:50.100 --> 00:44:52.710 align:middle line:84%
So what I was
doing with a 21 was

00:44:52.710 --> 00:44:55.740 align:middle line:84%
I was just giving numbers to be
able to try to kind of figure

00:44:55.740 --> 00:44:58.290 align:middle line:84%
out a way to relate
to all of it.

00:44:58.290 --> 00:45:00.480 align:middle line:90%
How do we exist?

00:45:00.480 --> 00:45:03.180 align:middle line:84%
Anybody kind of know
the answer to that?

00:45:03.180 --> 00:45:05.190 align:middle line:90%
[CHUCKLES]

00:45:05.190 --> 00:45:08.310 align:middle line:84%
So we'll get into the idea
of Rupert Sheldrake's works

00:45:08.310 --> 00:45:10.230 align:middle line:90%
of morphic fields.

00:45:10.230 --> 00:45:15.390 align:middle line:84%
So as an example,
the Siberian tiger,

00:45:15.390 --> 00:45:20.310 align:middle line:84%
there used to be, let's say,
tens of thousands of them.

00:45:20.310 --> 00:45:23.022 align:middle line:90%
And now there's a few hundred.

00:45:23.022 --> 00:45:26.230 align:middle line:84%
Everybody here contributes to
the energy field of this room.

00:45:26.230 --> 00:45:29.220 align:middle line:84%
So we could say there's
58 people in the room,

00:45:29.220 --> 00:45:33.090 align:middle line:84%
and there's a certain
energy density.

00:45:33.090 --> 00:45:34.810 align:middle line:84%
There's a certain
dimensionality.

00:45:34.810 --> 00:45:38.910 align:middle line:84%
So some people-- like I have
a sense of the feel of that,

00:45:38.910 --> 00:45:40.350 align:middle line:90%
how dense it is.

00:45:40.350 --> 00:45:43.080 align:middle line:84%
And of course if there was
10,000, it's different.

00:45:43.080 --> 00:45:45.900 align:middle line:84%
You go to a football
game or a concert,

00:45:45.900 --> 00:45:49.090 align:middle line:84%
you start having an
experience of that.

00:45:49.090 --> 00:45:52.410 align:middle line:84%
So I was using those
dimensions to try

00:45:52.410 --> 00:45:55.915 align:middle line:90%
to figure out the interactions.

00:45:55.915 --> 00:45:59.340 align:middle line:84%
So when you interact with
somebody on the phone,

00:45:59.340 --> 00:46:01.280 align:middle line:84%
how many dimensions
does one language

00:46:01.280 --> 00:46:03.000 align:middle line:84%
use that-- are you
interacting with?

00:46:03.000 --> 00:46:05.400 align:middle line:84%
Well, I'm interacting
with sound.

00:46:05.400 --> 00:46:08.580 align:middle line:84%
I'm interacting at
a vibratory level.

00:46:08.580 --> 00:46:11.850 align:middle line:84%
I'm interacting at
a frequency level.

00:46:11.850 --> 00:46:15.030 align:middle line:84%
Interacting at an
electromagnetic level, which is

00:46:15.030 --> 00:46:17.820 align:middle line:90%
probably a better definition.

00:46:17.820 --> 00:46:20.100 align:middle line:84%
But when I see somebody,
now I'm operating

00:46:20.100 --> 00:46:23.760 align:middle line:84%
on photonic information,
which is how we basically

00:46:23.760 --> 00:46:26.280 align:middle line:90%
interpret the world.

00:46:26.280 --> 00:46:30.000 align:middle line:84%
But what happens if you
shrink the morphic feel--

00:46:30.000 --> 00:46:31.550 align:middle line:90%
and I use Native Americans.

00:46:31.550 --> 00:46:35.160 align:middle line:84%
There was 150 million of us, and
they shrunk our population down

00:46:35.160 --> 00:46:36.870 align:middle line:90%
to less than 3 million.

00:46:36.870 --> 00:46:40.440 align:middle line:84%
We didn't have a very big
presence in the universe.

00:46:40.440 --> 00:46:42.180 align:middle line:90%
We talk about presence.

00:46:42.180 --> 00:46:43.590 align:middle line:90%
We don't have a big presence.

00:46:43.590 --> 00:46:44.390 align:middle line:90%
Why?

00:46:44.390 --> 00:46:45.870 align:middle line:90%
There's not as many of us.

00:46:45.870 --> 00:46:48.060 align:middle line:84%
But if you shrink it
down small enough,

00:46:48.060 --> 00:46:49.870 align:middle line:90%
that species will disappear.

00:46:49.870 --> 00:46:52.500 align:middle line:84%
So we talk about how
species disappear.

00:46:52.500 --> 00:46:54.660 align:middle line:84%
They lose their morphic
field before they ever

00:46:54.660 --> 00:46:56.580 align:middle line:90%
lose their physicality.

00:46:56.580 --> 00:46:59.620 align:middle line:84%
You lose your life
before you ever die.

00:46:59.620 --> 00:47:00.420 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:47:00.420 --> 00:47:01.840 align:middle line:90%
That's the language.

00:47:01.840 --> 00:47:04.950 align:middle line:84%
And the only way we
can ever explain it

00:47:04.950 --> 00:47:09.540 align:middle line:84%
is to try to apply some language
of dimensionality and stuff.

00:47:09.540 --> 00:47:12.660 align:middle line:84%
When you pass away,
where are you?

00:47:12.660 --> 00:47:15.900 align:middle line:84%
I've died about
seven times one week.

00:47:15.900 --> 00:47:18.150 align:middle line:90%
And I wasn't here.

00:47:18.150 --> 00:47:21.960 align:middle line:84%
And I can testify that
I was somewhere else.

00:47:21.960 --> 00:47:25.710 align:middle line:84%
And I'm going to call
that some other dimension

00:47:25.710 --> 00:47:28.350 align:middle line:90%
or some other dimensional set.

00:47:28.350 --> 00:47:31.260 align:middle line:84%
And now we get into what
we call reference sets.

00:47:31.260 --> 00:47:33.900 align:middle line:84%
So my reference set right
here is planet Earth,

00:47:33.900 --> 00:47:37.470 align:middle line:90%
and solid material.

00:47:37.470 --> 00:47:39.750 align:middle line:84%
But when you dream
and close your eyes,

00:47:39.750 --> 00:47:41.280 align:middle line:90%
there's no more planet Earth.

00:47:41.280 --> 00:47:43.410 align:middle line:90%
There's no more solid materials.

00:47:43.410 --> 00:47:47.010 align:middle line:84%
I'm relating with a much
different processing

00:47:47.010 --> 00:47:48.960 align:middle line:90%
and information set.

00:47:48.960 --> 00:47:52.290 align:middle line:90%
All humans are conceived female.

00:47:52.290 --> 00:47:54.580 align:middle line:90%
This is science, all right.

00:47:54.580 --> 00:47:59.760 align:middle line:84%
There's a hormonal flood that
changes the embryo into a male.

00:47:59.760 --> 00:48:02.260 align:middle line:10%
Now, we'll take a look at that.

00:48:02.260 --> 00:48:06.420 align:middle line:10%
So all males in here are the
result of a hormonal flood.

00:48:06.420 --> 00:48:11.110 align:middle line:84%
Do not make fun of your wife
or people as they get older.

00:48:11.110 --> 00:48:14.160 align:middle line:84%
So anyway, if we
look at that, then we

00:48:14.160 --> 00:48:17.910 align:middle line:84%
could say something to the
effect of, to what percentage

00:48:17.910 --> 00:48:22.260 align:middle line:84%
did that hormonal
flood be affective?

00:48:22.260 --> 00:48:25.800 align:middle line:84%
OK, so then we would
say, well, some women

00:48:25.800 --> 00:48:28.410 align:middle line:84%
have male characteristics,
and some men

00:48:28.410 --> 00:48:30.630 align:middle line:90%
have female characteristics.

00:48:30.630 --> 00:48:36.090 align:middle line:84%
And it's not that they're
less male or less female,

00:48:36.090 --> 00:48:40.230 align:middle line:84%
it's the expression of
the genome, it shows that.

00:48:40.230 --> 00:48:42.900 align:middle line:84%
Well, this is important,
because nobody here

00:48:42.900 --> 00:48:46.140 align:middle line:90%
is 100% male or 100% female.

00:48:46.140 --> 00:48:49.440 align:middle line:90%
And you literally--

00:48:49.440 --> 00:48:53.520 align:middle line:84%
I run about 85/15, but I learned
to modulate that up and down.

00:48:53.520 --> 00:48:56.160 align:middle line:84%
But we have 90/10's
and we'll say they're

00:48:56.160 --> 00:48:58.690 align:middle line:90%
very manly or very female.

00:48:58.690 --> 00:49:02.470 align:middle line:90%
And others, we might say 50/50.

00:49:02.470 --> 00:49:06.060 align:middle line:84%
They have strong-- and
we're talking physical form.

00:49:06.060 --> 00:49:10.170 align:middle line:84%
But when you say you like
somebody, what you're saying

00:49:10.170 --> 00:49:13.350 align:middle line:84%
is that my
electromagnetic stance

00:49:13.350 --> 00:49:15.490 align:middle line:90%
is able to interact with those.

00:49:15.490 --> 00:49:17.730 align:middle line:84%
So would you find a
partner, you have not

00:49:17.730 --> 00:49:20.640 align:middle line:84%
found a male or
female partner, you

00:49:20.640 --> 00:49:24.060 align:middle line:84%
have found somebody that
your electromagnetic field

00:49:24.060 --> 00:49:25.650 align:middle line:90%
can interact with theirs.

00:49:25.650 --> 00:49:29.410 align:middle line:84%
So an 85/15 will tend
to react to a 15/85.

00:49:29.410 --> 00:49:30.420 align:middle line:90%
You see what I mean?

00:49:30.420 --> 00:49:32.610 align:middle line:90%
And it's within 5 or 10 degrees.

00:49:32.610 --> 00:49:34.350 align:middle line:90%
But you're born with that.

00:49:34.350 --> 00:49:37.980 align:middle line:84%
Now, you can change
that, and we do in life.

00:49:37.980 --> 00:49:41.130 align:middle line:84%
But just so you
know, one more thing,

00:49:41.130 --> 00:49:45.000 align:middle line:84%
all people that are born male
or female, at the point of about

00:49:45.000 --> 00:49:50.160 align:middle line:84%
50 years on, will revert
back to the other sex.

00:49:50.160 --> 00:49:52.050 align:middle line:90%
All men will become women.

00:49:52.050 --> 00:49:54.540 align:middle line:84%
They will change
their hormonal stance.

00:49:54.540 --> 00:49:57.330 align:middle line:84%
All women will
change to become men.

00:49:57.330 --> 00:50:01.760 align:middle line:84%
And we call it menopause, but
nobody says the word manopause,

00:50:01.760 --> 00:50:03.090 align:middle line:90%
or wo-man--

00:50:03.090 --> 00:50:05.910 align:middle line:90%
I use wo-manopause.

00:50:05.910 --> 00:50:07.950 align:middle line:90%
So people don't teach this.

00:50:07.950 --> 00:50:10.950 align:middle line:84%
They don't go, hey,
you'll be a man some day,

00:50:10.950 --> 00:50:12.843 align:middle line:84%
like the song says,
but at some point

00:50:12.843 --> 00:50:14.010 align:middle line:90%
you're going to be a female.

00:50:14.010 --> 00:50:16.970 align:middle line:90%
You just have to get over it.

00:50:16.970 --> 00:50:18.553 align:middle line:84%
And if you're a
female, at some point,

00:50:18.553 --> 00:50:19.595 align:middle line:90%
you're going to be a man.

00:50:19.595 --> 00:50:20.410 align:middle line:90%
And we know this.

00:50:20.410 --> 00:50:21.550 align:middle line:90%
We see it.

00:50:21.550 --> 00:50:22.550 align:middle line:90%
>> We have the ability.

00:50:22.550 --> 00:50:24.870 align:middle line:84%
You're born with these
abilities already.

00:50:24.870 --> 00:50:26.940 align:middle line:90%
They're not activated yet.

00:50:26.940 --> 00:50:28.620 align:middle line:90%
So we're getting signals.

00:50:28.620 --> 00:50:32.670 align:middle line:84%
And if you know how to do it,
you can activate yourself.

00:50:32.670 --> 00:50:35.250 align:middle line:84%
And you can be activated
by others around you,

00:50:35.250 --> 00:50:37.240 align:middle line:84%
like we're activating
you right now.

00:50:37.240 --> 00:50:40.590 align:middle line:84%
There's a continuous
amount of energy

00:50:40.590 --> 00:50:44.250 align:middle line:84%
coming from different fields
and different dimensions that

00:50:44.250 --> 00:50:49.860 align:middle line:84%
are allowing us to access
our DNA easier so we

00:50:49.860 --> 00:50:52.320 align:middle line:90%
can heal ourselves from within.

00:50:52.320 --> 00:50:55.140 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, and even to allow you
to be in this room and to hear

00:50:55.140 --> 00:50:57.060 align:middle line:90%
this stuff.

00:50:57.060 --> 00:50:59.940 align:middle line:84%
Just to hear this
stuff alters you.

00:50:59.940 --> 00:51:01.840 align:middle line:84%
It's altering your
programming, how

00:51:01.840 --> 00:51:04.900 align:middle line:84%
you look at things, how
you'll interact in the future.

00:51:04.900 --> 00:51:08.510 align:middle line:84%
And so there's 50 or
60 people here now.

00:51:08.510 --> 00:51:10.650 align:middle line:84%
And there's 10,000
left without being

00:51:10.650 --> 00:51:12.990 align:middle line:84%
able to have the benefit
of trying to figure out

00:51:12.990 --> 00:51:14.880 align:middle line:84%
who they are, and how
they are, and that it's

00:51:14.880 --> 00:51:18.930 align:middle line:84%
OK to go through that process
of coming back to yourself.

00:51:18.930 --> 00:51:22.510 align:middle line:84%
Because that's all life is, is
you start out being yourself,

00:51:22.510 --> 00:51:25.050 align:middle line:84%
you become not yourself,
and hopefully you'll

00:51:25.050 --> 00:51:28.120 align:middle line:84%
come home to yourself
before you leave the planet.

00:51:28.120 --> 00:51:30.660 align:middle line:84%
OK, I grew up in a
Native American community

00:51:30.660 --> 00:51:40.440 align:middle line:84%
where to talk to a plant, or
an animal, a tree, was normal.

00:51:40.440 --> 00:51:43.980 align:middle line:90%
I didn't know not to do that.

00:51:43.980 --> 00:51:47.010 align:middle line:90%
Now, to talk is one thing--

00:51:47.010 --> 00:51:50.630 align:middle line:84%
just like the Dalai Lama says,
you talk with what you know,

00:51:50.630 --> 00:51:53.350 align:middle line:84%
but you listen with
you don't know.

00:51:53.350 --> 00:51:56.310 align:middle line:84%
So we don't teach
to talk to plants.

00:51:56.310 --> 00:51:58.910 align:middle line:84%
Marcel Vogel and Peter
Thompson wrote a book,

00:51:58.910 --> 00:52:00.630 align:middle line:90%
"The Secret Life of Plants."

00:52:00.630 --> 00:52:02.280 align:middle line:84%
People asked me,
how do you learn

00:52:02.280 --> 00:52:03.990 align:middle line:90%
telepathy or remote viewing?

00:52:03.990 --> 00:52:08.400 align:middle line:10%
Start with that book, because
it says plants have emotions,

00:52:08.400 --> 00:52:11.130 align:middle line:10%
and plants have feelings,
and plants have thoughts.

00:52:11.130 --> 00:52:14.560 align:middle line:10%
And this is science, but it
freaked out the whole world

00:52:14.560 --> 00:52:15.840 align:middle line:10%
when it came out.

00:52:15.840 --> 00:52:18.390 align:middle line:10%
And Marcel Vogel was
one of my first teachers

00:52:18.390 --> 00:52:19.750 align:middle line:10%
here in LA when I was like--

00:52:19.750 --> 00:52:23.140 align:middle line:10%
1971 or something,
whenever that came out.

00:52:23.140 --> 00:52:26.580 align:middle line:84%
So as a Native American,
I don't talk to plants.

00:52:26.580 --> 00:52:28.350 align:middle line:84%
You have to learn
to listen to it.

00:52:28.350 --> 00:52:31.230 align:middle line:84%
If you can learn to listen
to plants and animals,

00:52:31.230 --> 00:52:34.440 align:middle line:84%
then you can be a medicine
man or medicine woman.

00:52:34.440 --> 00:52:39.000 align:middle line:84%
So I'm like a medicine
man in that way,

00:52:39.000 --> 00:52:41.440 align:middle line:90%
because I can talk to trees.

00:52:41.440 --> 00:52:42.240 align:middle line:90%
That's wrong.

00:52:42.240 --> 00:52:44.880 align:middle line:90%
I can listen to trees.

00:52:44.880 --> 00:52:49.100 align:middle line:84%
And so when we talk
about ET communication,

00:52:49.100 --> 00:52:51.300 align:middle line:84%
interdimensions, and
things like that--

00:52:51.300 --> 00:52:54.470 align:middle line:90%
anybody here talk to their cat?

00:52:54.470 --> 00:52:56.270 align:middle line:90%
Anybody talk to their dog?

00:52:56.270 --> 00:52:59.210 align:middle line:84%
What makes you think
they don't speak English?

00:52:59.210 --> 00:53:01.570 align:middle line:90%
They react to you.

00:53:01.570 --> 00:53:04.680 align:middle line:84%
You speak French to it, it'll
understand French, German.

00:53:04.680 --> 00:53:08.000 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't care what language
if you practice with it.

00:53:08.000 --> 00:53:13.085 align:middle line:84%
And it's been demonstrated
with African greys and dogs--

00:53:13.085 --> 00:53:15.830 align:middle line:90%


00:53:15.830 --> 00:53:17.900 align:middle line:84%
like how do you talk
to a dog or animal?

00:53:17.900 --> 00:53:20.730 align:middle line:90%
Does anybody here know?

00:53:20.730 --> 00:53:21.820 align:middle line:90%
OK, I'll tell you.

00:53:21.820 --> 00:53:22.620 align:middle line:90%
>> [INAUDIBLE]

00:53:22.620 --> 00:53:23.440 align:middle line:90%
>> Emojis.

00:53:23.440 --> 00:53:25.580 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, yeah.

00:53:25.580 --> 00:53:27.290 align:middle line:90%
>> Hieroglyphics.

00:53:27.290 --> 00:53:30.140 align:middle line:84%
What you hold in mind
tends to manifest.

00:53:30.140 --> 00:53:32.240 align:middle line:84%
This is one of those
spiritual rules.

00:53:32.240 --> 00:53:34.310 align:middle line:84%
What you hold in mind
tends to manifest.

00:53:34.310 --> 00:53:36.500 align:middle line:10%
What you hold in mind
with a whole lot of energy

00:53:36.500 --> 00:53:38.320 align:middle line:10%
tends to manifest
better than just,

00:53:38.320 --> 00:53:41.450 align:middle line:10%
oh, I'd like a hamburger today.

00:53:41.450 --> 00:53:44.210 align:middle line:84%
So with a cat or dog--
and I've done this.

00:53:44.210 --> 00:53:46.310 align:middle line:90%
A lady had a very reclusive cat.

00:53:46.310 --> 00:53:47.330 align:middle line:10%
It would run and hide.

00:53:47.330 --> 00:53:48.810 align:middle line:90%
I went to her house.

00:53:48.810 --> 00:53:51.260 align:middle line:84%
And she goes, he
doesn't come out.

00:53:51.260 --> 00:53:53.270 align:middle line:90%
And so I dropped my hand.

00:53:53.270 --> 00:53:55.730 align:middle line:10%
See what I'm doing?

00:53:55.730 --> 00:53:58.100 align:middle line:10%
And then about three
or four minutes later,

00:53:58.100 --> 00:53:59.900 align:middle line:10%
there's a cat
underneath my hand,

00:53:59.900 --> 00:54:04.430 align:middle line:10%
and I'm stroking its back,
and it's in love with me.

00:54:04.430 --> 00:54:05.780 align:middle line:90%
Her eyes got big.

00:54:05.780 --> 00:54:07.940 align:middle line:90%
She goes, he never comes out.

00:54:07.940 --> 00:54:12.060 align:middle line:84%
If somebody comes to the door,
he's gone for hours hiding out.

00:54:12.060 --> 00:54:14.300 align:middle line:84%
And I go, they all
like to be petted.

00:54:14.300 --> 00:54:16.340 align:middle line:90%
We're no different.

00:54:16.340 --> 00:54:19.400 align:middle line:84%
If you want to know what human
currency is to be petted.

00:54:19.400 --> 00:54:22.160 align:middle line:90%
Only we don't like to be petted.

00:54:22.160 --> 00:54:26.900 align:middle line:84%
We'll accept being
patted, barely.

00:54:26.900 --> 00:54:29.180 align:middle line:10%
And hugs sometimes are
out of the question.

00:54:29.180 --> 00:54:30.410 align:middle line:90%
But that's all changed.

00:54:30.410 --> 00:54:34.760 align:middle line:84%
That's a morphic field
change in the last 30 years.

00:54:34.760 --> 00:54:37.100 align:middle line:84%
When I was in my
20s, I would never

00:54:37.100 --> 00:54:40.280 align:middle line:84%
think about running up and
hugging a man or a woman,

00:54:40.280 --> 00:54:44.270 align:middle line:84%
you know what I mean,
or somebody's dog.

00:54:44.270 --> 00:54:46.700 align:middle line:84%
And now people are like,
I have this giant dog,

00:54:46.700 --> 00:54:49.790 align:middle line:84%
and everyone wants to
jump down and hug it.

00:54:49.790 --> 00:54:52.430 align:middle line:90%
And it's like, that is scary.

00:54:52.430 --> 00:54:55.440 align:middle line:84%
And even more so if you think
of it as a man or a woman.

00:54:55.440 --> 00:54:57.410 align:middle line:90%
[CHUCKLES]

00:54:57.410 --> 00:54:58.340 align:middle line:90%
Don't do it.

00:54:58.340 --> 00:55:00.257 align:middle line:84%
But everybody likes to
do it, so there you go.

00:55:00.257 --> 00:55:01.700 align:middle line:84%
So now we have a
hugging culture.

00:55:01.700 --> 00:55:04.990 align:middle line:90%
That's a morphic field shift.

00:55:04.990 --> 00:55:08.150 align:middle line:84%
How much choice do
you have in your life?

00:55:08.150 --> 00:55:11.160 align:middle line:90%
And the answer is not very much.

00:55:11.160 --> 00:55:13.670 align:middle line:10%
An example of where the
programming shows up

00:55:13.670 --> 00:55:16.490 align:middle line:10%
is, if I took any of you
to dinner and I said,

00:55:16.490 --> 00:55:19.100 align:middle line:10%
OK, it's your turn
to order, watch--

00:55:19.100 --> 00:55:25.096 align:middle line:10%
do you say, may I have,
can I have, or will I have?

00:55:25.096 --> 00:55:29.040 align:middle line:84%
When I go to dinner,
I will have a steak.

00:55:29.040 --> 00:55:31.770 align:middle line:84%
You would not believe, I've
been with wealthy people,

00:55:31.770 --> 00:55:34.440 align:middle line:84%
I've been with all kinds of
people, and they go, can I?

00:55:34.440 --> 00:55:37.350 align:middle line:90%
And I want to go, slap.

00:55:37.350 --> 00:55:39.590 align:middle line:84%
I'm a peaceful
person, you can tell.

00:55:39.590 --> 00:55:45.210 align:middle line:84%
And I want to go,
they're not your parent.

00:55:45.210 --> 00:55:49.410 align:middle line:84%
They're not here to tell
you, can you have that.

00:55:49.410 --> 00:55:51.240 align:middle line:84%
And then they'll
go, may I have it?

00:55:51.240 --> 00:55:53.190 align:middle line:90%
Slap.

00:55:53.190 --> 00:55:56.820 align:middle line:84%
They're not here to
give you permission.

00:55:56.820 --> 00:56:00.570 align:middle line:84%
When you say, I will
have, you're saying,

00:56:00.570 --> 00:56:03.210 align:middle line:84%
I have permission
to have what I want

00:56:03.210 --> 00:56:05.340 align:middle line:84%
and I deserve to
have what I want.

00:56:05.340 --> 00:56:07.590 align:middle line:84%
And if you want to know the
two major things that keep

00:56:07.590 --> 00:56:09.510 align:middle line:90%
you being successful in life--

00:56:09.510 --> 00:56:11.910 align:middle line:84%
and I deal with this
with all businesses--

00:56:11.910 --> 00:56:14.790 align:middle line:84%
is the concepts of
permission and deserving.

00:56:14.790 --> 00:56:19.860 align:middle line:84%
And everybody has permission and
deserving issues from somebody

00:56:19.860 --> 00:56:21.570 align:middle line:90%
or something in their life.

00:56:21.570 --> 00:56:23.280 align:middle line:84%
And it's part of
their programming.

00:56:23.280 --> 00:56:27.270 align:middle line:84%
And if you ever overcome that
or see somebody successful,

00:56:27.270 --> 00:56:29.970 align:middle line:84%
no matter whether it's a
relationship or financial,

00:56:29.970 --> 00:56:32.310 align:middle line:84%
they have overcome
that to some degree.

00:56:32.310 --> 00:56:35.100 align:middle line:84%
But don't think they've
eliminated all of it.

00:56:35.100 --> 00:56:36.720 align:middle line:90%
We all plateau.

00:56:36.720 --> 00:56:38.220 align:middle line:90%
But you can go beyond it.

00:56:38.220 --> 00:56:44.100 align:middle line:84%
And that's when we truly get
to be an unlimited one of us.

00:56:44.100 --> 00:56:49.300 align:middle line:10%
If you pray to a God,
or gods as we say,

00:56:49.300 --> 00:56:54.450 align:middle line:10%
or if you do
affirmations, you're

00:56:54.450 --> 00:56:57.480 align:middle line:10%
trying to increase the
potentiality of anything

00:56:57.480 --> 00:56:59.820 align:middle line:10%
you're doing.

00:56:59.820 --> 00:57:03.210 align:middle line:84%
So any practice--
it doesn't make--

00:57:03.210 --> 00:57:05.610 align:middle line:90%
pick one.

00:57:05.610 --> 00:57:07.560 align:middle line:84%
Anything you do
like that is meant

00:57:07.560 --> 00:57:12.210 align:middle line:84%
to increase the density of the
information or energy you have

00:57:12.210 --> 00:57:17.680 align:middle line:84%
to express as an artist, a cook,
a wife, a husband, whatever

00:57:17.680 --> 00:57:18.480 align:middle line:90%
it is.

00:57:18.480 --> 00:57:22.920 align:middle line:84%
So everybody can do
things to increase that.

00:57:22.920 --> 00:57:25.860 align:middle line:84%
Number one, nobody
here is allowed

00:57:25.860 --> 00:57:29.040 align:middle line:84%
to help humanity unless they
have taken care of themself

00:57:29.040 --> 00:57:30.780 align:middle line:90%
first.

00:57:30.780 --> 00:57:32.958 align:middle line:84%
If you bankrupt
yourself, mentally,

00:57:32.958 --> 00:57:34.500 align:middle line:84%
physically, emotionally,
spiritually,

00:57:34.500 --> 00:57:39.840 align:middle line:84%
whatever, to help me, you
have created a karmic burden.

00:57:39.840 --> 00:57:44.100 align:middle line:84%
So the rule is-- and we deal
with this on a spiritual level.

00:57:44.100 --> 00:57:48.720 align:middle line:84%
If you are at 100% of yourself
and where you are in life,

00:57:48.720 --> 00:57:51.530 align:middle line:84%
and you give away
10%, you are bankrupt.

00:57:51.530 --> 00:57:56.460 align:middle line:84%
You are unable to continue
with your own life, whatever

00:57:56.460 --> 00:57:58.120 align:middle line:90%
you want to call it.

00:57:58.120 --> 00:58:03.930 align:middle line:84%
If you have 110%, you are
allowed to give 10% away.

00:58:03.930 --> 00:58:05.310 align:middle line:90%
This is where we get tithing.

00:58:05.310 --> 00:58:09.660 align:middle line:84%
Every culture in the world
has some form of tithing.

00:58:09.660 --> 00:58:13.230 align:middle line:84%
But the idea is that at
110%, you give 10% away,

00:58:13.230 --> 00:58:17.580 align:middle line:84%
you now no longer have any
way to advance yourself.

00:58:17.580 --> 00:58:19.360 align:middle line:90%
And I'm getting to a point.

00:58:19.360 --> 00:58:21.810 align:middle line:84%
When you get to
about 120%, now you

00:58:21.810 --> 00:58:23.160 align:middle line:90%
can afford to help other people.

00:58:23.160 --> 00:58:25.920 align:middle line:84%
Normally that would be in
your 30s for most people

00:58:25.920 --> 00:58:29.160 align:middle line:84%
that you actually can
become philanthropic.

00:58:29.160 --> 00:58:31.110 align:middle line:90%
But let's not apply it to money.

00:58:31.110 --> 00:58:34.890 align:middle line:10%
Let's apply it to our own energy
and apply it to our own health.

00:58:34.890 --> 00:58:37.230 align:middle line:90%
OK, now here's the rule.

00:58:37.230 --> 00:58:40.500 align:middle line:84%
If you want to help
people, help humanity--

00:58:40.500 --> 00:58:42.990 align:middle line:84%
Bill Gates has done
more to help humanity,

00:58:42.990 --> 00:58:45.300 align:middle line:84%
no matter whether you like
him or not, because he

00:58:45.300 --> 00:58:47.550 align:middle line:90%
has given billions of dollars--

00:58:47.550 --> 00:58:50.070 align:middle line:84%
we'll cross that out
and put, energy--

00:58:50.070 --> 00:58:51.355 align:middle line:90%
to the rest of the world.

00:58:51.355 --> 00:58:52.510 align:middle line:90%
You see what I mean?

00:58:52.510 --> 00:58:55.500 align:middle line:84%
You cannot help
anybody by being poor--

00:58:55.500 --> 00:58:58.890 align:middle line:84%
poor in spirit, poor in
finances, poor in health.

00:58:58.890 --> 00:59:00.310 align:middle line:90%
Do you see?

00:59:00.310 --> 00:59:05.310 align:middle line:84%
So to be selfish is something
we were beat out of.

00:59:05.310 --> 00:59:06.540 align:middle line:90%
It was a program--

00:59:06.540 --> 00:59:08.670 align:middle line:84%
don't be selfish--
when you were a child.

00:59:08.670 --> 00:59:12.030 align:middle line:84%
And I'm telling you to be
selfish of your own health

00:59:12.030 --> 00:59:15.960 align:middle line:84%
and well-being to the
point that you have excess

00:59:15.960 --> 00:59:19.800 align:middle line:84%
and you can then share
that with other people.

00:59:19.800 --> 00:59:23.040 align:middle line:10%
If you are of a mind
to help other people,

00:59:23.040 --> 00:59:25.200 align:middle line:10%
they will show
up, I promise you.

00:59:25.200 --> 00:59:26.850 align:middle line:10%
>> Absolutely.

00:59:26.850 --> 00:59:29.460 align:middle line:10%
>> If you tell me you
make good cookies,

00:59:29.460 --> 00:59:31.823 align:middle line:10%
I promise you I'll
be at your doorstep.

00:59:31.823 --> 00:59:34.290 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:59:34.290 --> 00:59:36.100 align:middle line:90%
I have a cookie problem.

00:59:36.100 --> 00:59:40.420 align:middle line:84%
So this is not True Confession
and Cookies Anonymous,

00:59:40.420 --> 00:59:42.330 align:middle line:90%
but anyway.

00:59:42.330 --> 00:59:44.220 align:middle line:90%
So but do you see what I mean?

00:59:44.220 --> 00:59:49.140 align:middle line:84%
You don't have to seek
out helping other people.

00:59:49.140 --> 00:59:50.950 align:middle line:90%
Everybody you meet needs help.

00:59:50.950 --> 00:59:52.890 align:middle line:84%
The question is
whether that help

00:59:52.890 --> 00:59:55.720 align:middle line:84%
is going to bankrupt
you or cost you in a way

00:59:55.720 --> 00:59:57.980 align:middle line:90%
that now you have to recover.

00:59:57.980 --> 01:00:01.020 align:middle line:84%
And even though I work on
people and help people,

01:00:01.020 --> 01:00:05.130 align:middle line:84%
I used to do it to the point
I'd be tired or be worn out.

01:00:05.130 --> 01:00:07.410 align:middle line:90%
And I don't do that anymore.

01:00:07.410 --> 01:00:09.960 align:middle line:84%
Because it's a disservice
to them and it's

01:00:09.960 --> 01:00:11.580 align:middle line:90%
a disservice to me.

01:00:11.580 --> 01:00:13.950 align:middle line:84%
It's a karmic burden
to them, and it

01:00:13.950 --> 01:00:16.230 align:middle line:90%
causes me to have ill health.

01:00:16.230 --> 01:00:18.750 align:middle line:10%
And there is no good
that can come of that.

01:00:18.750 --> 01:00:23.700 align:middle line:84%
>> And we're also not
here to change you.

01:00:23.700 --> 01:00:25.360 align:middle line:90%
You're not here to change me.

01:00:25.360 --> 01:00:26.890 align:middle line:84%
You're not here to
change the world.

01:00:26.890 --> 01:00:29.480 align:middle line:90%
Because we're on a trajectory.

01:00:29.480 --> 01:00:31.950 align:middle line:84%
There's a path that's here
that's going to happen,

01:00:31.950 --> 01:00:34.270 align:middle line:90%
because it already happened.

01:00:34.270 --> 01:00:38.470 align:middle line:84%
And if you can realize
that, that what has just

01:00:38.470 --> 01:00:41.170 align:middle line:84%
been said has already
happened, and what's

01:00:41.170 --> 01:00:44.200 align:middle line:84%
going to happen 20 years from
now has already happened,

01:00:44.200 --> 01:00:46.935 align:middle line:84%
then it has nothing to
do with you stepping up.

01:00:46.935 --> 01:00:48.310 align:middle line:84%
And people are
always thanking me

01:00:48.310 --> 01:00:51.610 align:middle line:84%
for stepping up to bring these
technologies forward and talk

01:00:51.610 --> 01:00:53.200 align:middle line:90%
about this type of stuff.

01:00:53.200 --> 01:00:57.580 align:middle line:84%
But it's up to you if you
want to go down that path.

01:00:57.580 --> 01:01:02.240 align:middle line:10%
Because you're really here
to enjoy your time here

01:01:02.240 --> 01:01:03.510 align:middle line:10%
and to learn.

01:01:03.510 --> 01:01:05.150 align:middle line:90%
This is school.

01:01:05.150 --> 01:01:07.360 align:middle line:90%
And you're in school right now.

01:01:07.360 --> 01:01:10.230 align:middle line:90%
OK, we're not here to--

01:01:10.230 --> 01:01:13.348 align:middle line:84%
everyone wants to
change the world.

01:01:13.348 --> 01:01:15.390 align:middle line:10%
There's not enough money
in the world to do that,

01:01:15.390 --> 01:01:18.210 align:middle line:10%
because it starts with
you, and it starts

01:01:18.210 --> 01:01:19.410 align:middle line:10%
with the people next to you.

01:01:19.410 --> 01:01:21.540 align:middle line:84%
It starts with the
people in this room.

01:01:21.540 --> 01:01:24.570 align:middle line:10%
>> And being a
spiritual teacher,

01:01:24.570 --> 01:01:27.450 align:middle line:10%
I want to give you
a spiritual idea--

01:01:27.450 --> 01:01:29.080 align:middle line:10%
don't cheat on recess.

01:01:29.080 --> 01:01:29.880 align:middle line:10%
[AUDIENCE CHUCKLES]

01:01:29.880 --> 01:01:30.780 align:middle line:10%
OK?

01:01:30.780 --> 01:01:31.860 align:middle line:90%
That's it.

01:01:31.860 --> 01:01:35.320 align:middle line:84%
I don't care what you do, I
don't care your relationships.

01:01:35.320 --> 01:01:38.280 align:middle line:84%
Somewhere, you have
got to go have recess.

01:01:38.280 --> 01:01:40.170 align:middle line:90%
You have got to go play.

01:01:40.170 --> 01:01:46.020 align:middle line:84%
Because if you don't, you will
damage and alter your spirit.

01:01:46.020 --> 01:01:49.380 align:middle line:84%
So as a spiritual guru,
that's your spiritual guidance

01:01:49.380 --> 01:01:50.190 align:middle line:90%
from here on out.

01:01:50.190 --> 01:01:51.660 align:middle line:84%
Bless you, bless you,
bless you, Alright.

01:01:51.660 --> 01:01:51.790 align:middle line:90%
So--

01:01:51.790 --> 01:01:52.590 align:middle line:90%
[AUDIENCE CHUCKLES]

01:01:52.590 --> 01:01:54.330 align:middle line:90%
--all right.

01:01:54.330 --> 01:01:59.760 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, let's talk about
your Native American Indian

01:02:01.230 --> 01:02:04.560 align:middle line:84%
I have a little bit of
Blackfeet Indian in me--

01:02:04.560 --> 01:02:10.120 align:middle line:84%
and their association
with the stars.

01:02:10.120 --> 01:02:12.720 align:middle line:84%
Because this is an
exciting topic I think you

01:02:12.720 --> 01:02:14.520 align:middle line:90%
guys will enjoy.

01:02:14.520 --> 01:02:17.120 align:middle line:84%
These astronauts came
to these reservations.

01:02:17.120 --> 01:02:18.491 align:middle line:90%
I saw them.

01:02:18.491 --> 01:02:21.315 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, you know,
you don't realize--

01:02:21.315 --> 01:02:24.890 align:middle line:90%


01:02:24.890 --> 01:02:30.010 align:middle line:84%
Dr. Jay [? Clayton-Fever, ?]
when I was at university,

01:02:30.010 --> 01:02:34.160 align:middle line:84%
grabbed me one day when I was
leaving the philosophy program,

01:02:34.160 --> 01:02:38.840 align:middle line:84%
and said, I want to tell you
something very important.

01:02:38.840 --> 01:02:41.030 align:middle line:84%
You have a bubble
you grew up in.

01:02:41.030 --> 01:02:43.232 align:middle line:84%
That's where I came
up with this language.

01:02:43.232 --> 01:02:44.690 align:middle line:84%
And he said, the
only way out of it

01:02:44.690 --> 01:02:47.840 align:middle line:90%
is to make the bubble bigger.

01:02:47.840 --> 01:02:53.330 align:middle line:84%
And so the idea being you would
include more information or--

01:02:53.330 --> 01:02:55.160 align:middle line:84%
there's a lot of
ways to do that.

01:02:55.160 --> 01:02:59.558 align:middle line:84%
Even being here is
changing your bubble.

01:02:59.558 --> 01:03:01.100 align:middle line:84%
And one of the
things-- remember what

01:03:01.100 --> 01:03:03.440 align:middle line:84%
I said about I
would move schools,

01:03:03.440 --> 01:03:04.730 align:middle line:90%
and I would go to one school.

01:03:04.730 --> 01:03:05.780 align:middle line:90%
And then I'd be out.

01:03:05.780 --> 01:03:09.060 align:middle line:84%
And six states away, I'd be
in another school and stuff.

01:03:09.060 --> 01:03:12.230 align:middle line:84%
So I thought that was normal
to change environments.

01:03:12.230 --> 01:03:14.690 align:middle line:84%
Most people get
stuck in one place.

01:03:14.690 --> 01:03:19.580 align:middle line:84%
So the reality of
Arizona, New Mexico, Utah,

01:03:19.580 --> 01:03:24.290 align:middle line:84%
all that area through there
is a way different reality

01:03:24.290 --> 01:03:27.560 align:middle line:84%
than normal realities,
say California, which

01:03:27.560 --> 01:03:29.640 align:middle line:90%
is not normal in my opinion.

01:03:29.640 --> 01:03:32.120 align:middle line:84%
And of course neither is
New York or a whole bunch

01:03:32.120 --> 01:03:33.620 align:middle line:90%
of other places.

01:03:33.620 --> 01:03:37.820 align:middle line:84%
A different reality has
a different skill set.

01:03:37.820 --> 01:03:39.450 align:middle line:90%
They have different skill sets.

01:03:39.450 --> 01:03:41.530 align:middle line:84%
Like the way you
would farm in Arizona

01:03:41.530 --> 01:03:46.910 align:middle line:84%
is different than the way it
farm in Nebraska or something.

01:03:46.910 --> 01:03:48.510 align:middle line:90%
The food you would consume--

01:03:48.510 --> 01:03:50.870 align:middle line:84%
do you see how
everything is tied

01:03:50.870 --> 01:03:54.890 align:middle line:84%
to this 30-mile
approximate reality.

01:03:54.890 --> 01:03:58.070 align:middle line:84%
Your entire thought process
and everything are key to it

01:03:58.070 --> 01:03:59.880 align:middle line:90%
and come from it.

01:03:59.880 --> 01:04:04.260 align:middle line:84%
So a lot of
information that people

01:04:04.260 --> 01:04:08.700 align:middle line:84%
are coming to-- and we even
imply that the entire New Age

01:04:08.700 --> 01:04:11.730 align:middle line:84%
movement and everything
came because people

01:04:11.730 --> 01:04:18.180 align:middle line:84%
tried to reassess Native
American information.

01:04:18.180 --> 01:04:23.790 align:middle line:84%
We had a way of being that did
not include just the physical.

01:04:23.790 --> 01:04:26.760 align:middle line:84%
We had a spiritual way of
being and a spiritual way

01:04:26.760 --> 01:04:29.820 align:middle line:84%
of interactment--
more dimensions,

01:04:29.820 --> 01:04:32.130 align:middle line:84%
more like the cats
and dogs and humans

01:04:32.130 --> 01:04:35.620 align:middle line:84%
combined, because we
thought it was normal.

01:04:35.620 --> 01:04:38.320 align:middle line:90%
So that kind of information--

01:04:38.320 --> 01:04:41.020 align:middle line:84%
the more you interact with
a dog, or cat, or animal,

01:04:41.020 --> 01:04:42.780 align:middle line:90%
the more human you become.

01:04:42.780 --> 01:04:44.670 align:middle line:84%
Well, how much more
human could you

01:04:44.670 --> 01:04:47.220 align:middle line:84%
be if you interacted with
the plants, and the trees,

01:04:47.220 --> 01:04:49.240 align:middle line:90%
and the water, and the sky?

01:04:49.240 --> 01:04:53.640 align:middle line:84%
And we did all that, and we
have all that information.

01:04:53.640 --> 01:04:55.920 align:middle line:84%
And people are
running around trying

01:04:55.920 --> 01:04:57.790 align:middle line:90%
to figure this stuff out.

01:04:57.790 --> 01:05:03.060 align:middle line:84%
And it's not a bad language, but
nobody ever asked us Indians--

01:05:03.060 --> 01:05:04.290 align:middle line:90%
[CHUCKLES]

01:05:04.290 --> 01:05:05.940 align:middle line:90%
--like, how does this all work?

01:05:05.940 --> 01:05:07.890 align:middle line:90%
Because we can tell you.

01:05:07.890 --> 01:05:09.250 align:middle line:90%
We never forgot it.

01:05:09.250 --> 01:05:12.330 align:middle line:84%
At least-- we're starting
to have generations now that

01:05:12.330 --> 01:05:13.650 align:middle line:90%
have not been exposed to it.

01:05:13.650 --> 01:05:15.630 align:middle line:90%
But you grew up with it.

01:05:15.630 --> 01:05:17.130 align:middle line:90%
You didn't learn it.

01:05:17.130 --> 01:05:18.540 align:middle line:90%
It was osmosis.

01:05:18.540 --> 01:05:21.120 align:middle line:84%
It came from the land and
came from our culture.

01:05:21.120 --> 01:05:23.110 align:middle line:84%
>> And it wasn't text
that could be rewritten.

01:05:23.110 --> 01:05:23.910 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

01:05:23.910 --> 01:05:25.320 align:middle line:90%
>> That's important.

01:05:25.320 --> 01:05:28.020 align:middle line:84%
>> It was something that
was the same for my grandma,

01:05:28.020 --> 01:05:30.390 align:middle line:84%
and her grandmother,
and all the way back.

01:05:30.390 --> 01:05:32.280 align:middle line:90%
We all know the same things.

01:05:32.280 --> 01:05:37.620 align:middle line:84%
It's totally different than,
we'll say, Western culture.

01:05:37.620 --> 01:05:40.920 align:middle line:84%
And so we also have a
myth that at some point

01:05:40.920 --> 01:05:44.670 align:middle line:84%
the white race would come back
to us to learn what we know.

01:05:44.670 --> 01:05:47.670 align:middle line:84%
And hopefully we wouldn't
be destroyed completely

01:05:47.670 --> 01:05:49.500 align:middle line:90%
before they did that.

01:05:49.500 --> 01:05:54.000 align:middle line:84%
So to me the entire spiritual
movements and things like that

01:05:54.000 --> 01:05:58.530 align:middle line:84%
is trying to reacquire
something that we never lost.

01:05:58.530 --> 01:05:59.550 align:middle line:90%
We have that.

01:05:59.550 --> 01:06:02.790 align:middle line:84%
We just don't talk
about it or show it

01:06:02.790 --> 01:06:05.310 align:middle line:84%
unless you're among
similar people.

01:06:05.310 --> 01:06:08.010 align:middle line:90%


01:06:08.010 --> 01:06:14.220 align:middle line:10%
You go on a reservation, it's
not the same way of speaking.

01:06:14.220 --> 01:06:16.680 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it goes
on and on and on.

01:06:16.680 --> 01:06:19.770 align:middle line:84%
But again, most people,
they didn't grow up in it,

01:06:19.770 --> 01:06:22.170 align:middle line:90%
so they're not aware of it.

01:06:22.170 --> 01:06:25.250 align:middle line:84%
So if you reacquire some
of those skill sets,

01:06:25.250 --> 01:06:26.500 align:middle line:90%
you learn to listen to people.

01:06:26.500 --> 01:06:27.375 align:middle line:90%
Remember what I said?

01:06:27.375 --> 01:06:28.990 align:middle line:90%
You learn to listen to yourself.

01:06:28.990 --> 01:06:33.150 align:middle line:84%
And then if you're acting out,
you learn to see yourself.

01:06:33.150 --> 01:06:35.400 align:middle line:84%
All teenagers should
learn to see themselves.

01:06:35.400 --> 01:06:38.760 align:middle line:90%
Like look at you being that way.

01:06:38.760 --> 01:06:43.830 align:middle line:84%
And listen to how you're talking
because your words have power.

01:06:43.830 --> 01:06:47.220 align:middle line:84%
And they either come from
your head or from your heart.

01:06:47.220 --> 01:06:50.310 align:middle line:84%
And so that's the Native
American way of saying

01:06:50.310 --> 01:06:52.590 align:middle line:90%
everything I've said today.

01:06:52.590 --> 01:06:54.750 align:middle line:84%
Because in that
kind of position,

01:06:54.750 --> 01:06:57.160 align:middle line:84%
you actually have
knowledge come to you.

01:06:57.160 --> 01:07:00.690 align:middle line:84%
And remember, it's
not a thinking thing.

01:07:00.690 --> 01:07:03.143 align:middle line:84%
And one of the things we
teach is stop thinking.

01:07:03.143 --> 01:07:04.435 align:middle line:90%
It's just absolutely worthless.

01:07:04.435 --> 01:07:07.040 align:middle line:90%
It'll mess you up.

01:07:07.040 --> 01:07:09.900 align:middle line:84%
Number one reality is
just physical reality.

01:07:09.900 --> 01:07:12.960 align:middle line:84%
And then zero
reality is everything

01:07:12.960 --> 01:07:15.840 align:middle line:84%
from your imagination,
your memory, everything--

01:07:15.840 --> 01:07:18.170 align:middle line:90%
because you can't touch it.

01:07:18.170 --> 01:07:19.490 align:middle line:90%
You know, show me your memory.

01:07:19.490 --> 01:07:20.310 align:middle line:90%
Oh, I can tell you.

01:07:20.310 --> 01:07:22.260 align:middle line:90%
No, show it to me.

01:07:22.260 --> 01:07:28.440 align:middle line:84%
It's the interaction with the
animate versus the inanimate.

01:07:28.440 --> 01:07:31.020 align:middle line:84%
And Western culture-- and
we're talking about basically

01:07:31.020 --> 01:07:33.960 align:middle line:84%
the whole world except
maybe some people in India,

01:07:33.960 --> 01:07:36.450 align:middle line:84%
and Tibet, and
places like that--

01:07:36.450 --> 01:07:39.450 align:middle line:84%
we're no longer
interested in the animate.

01:07:39.450 --> 01:07:44.260 align:middle line:84%
We're no longer interested in
number one reality too much.

01:07:44.260 --> 01:07:46.200 align:middle line:84%
I'd love to have
a Lambo if anybody

01:07:46.200 --> 01:07:49.020 align:middle line:84%
is of a spiritual nature
and wants to gift it to me.

01:07:49.020 --> 01:07:51.330 align:middle line:90%
But I don't really need it--

01:07:51.330 --> 01:07:52.500 align:middle line:90%
[CHUCKLES]

01:07:52.500 --> 01:07:56.280 align:middle line:84%
--because I spend more
time in the inanimate.

01:07:56.280 --> 01:07:59.760 align:middle line:84%
I spend more time
in the zero reality.

01:07:59.760 --> 01:08:05.340 align:middle line:84%
Because the zero reality is
the one where animals speak,

01:08:05.340 --> 01:08:07.452 align:middle line:90%
plants speak.

01:08:07.452 --> 01:08:08.910 align:middle line:84%
It's much more--
remember we talked

01:08:08.910 --> 01:08:12.870 align:middle line:84%
about that which is satisfying,
that which is fulfilling.

01:08:12.870 --> 01:08:16.620 align:middle line:84%
So the Western culture
couldn't understand

01:08:16.620 --> 01:08:19.859 align:middle line:84%
how a Native American
or Indian could

01:08:19.859 --> 01:08:22.890 align:middle line:90%
have nothing and be so happy.

01:08:22.890 --> 01:08:26.660 align:middle line:84%
And the answer was we
were very fulfilled.

01:08:26.660 --> 01:08:31.529 align:middle line:84%
We didn't need
anything particularly.

01:08:31.529 --> 01:08:35.990 align:middle line:84%
So materialism comes along
and you get caught up,

01:08:35.990 --> 01:08:39.420 align:middle line:84%
and man, you need the latest
shoes, the latest clothes,

01:08:39.420 --> 01:08:42.390 align:middle line:90%
the latest food, I'm a vegan--

01:08:42.390 --> 01:08:44.899 align:middle line:84%
"bad hunter" in Indian
language, right?

01:08:44.899 --> 01:08:45.930 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]l

01:08:45.930 --> 01:08:46.740 align:middle line:90%


01:08:46.740 --> 01:08:47.609 align:middle line:90%
You see what I mean?

01:08:47.609 --> 01:08:50.359 align:middle line:90%
It's like-- right?

01:08:50.359 --> 01:08:55.040 align:middle line:84%
And so what Emery brought up
is like, oh, there's giants.

01:08:55.040 --> 01:08:57.240 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, Smithsonian buried that.

01:08:57.240 --> 01:09:00.609 align:middle line:90%
But I'm not supposed to say.

01:09:00.609 --> 01:09:03.550 align:middle line:84%
Native Americans are real good
about not telling you stuff.

01:09:03.550 --> 01:09:04.840 align:middle line:90%
We've learned.

01:09:04.840 --> 01:09:07.840 align:middle line:84%
But Acoma has two
giant skeletons.

01:09:07.840 --> 01:09:09.880 align:middle line:90%
Black mesa has them.

01:09:09.880 --> 01:09:11.300 align:middle line:90%
The Seneca have them.

01:09:11.300 --> 01:09:14.740 align:middle line:84%
I mean, if you ask
us, we'll load you up

01:09:14.740 --> 01:09:19.300 align:middle line:84%
with thousands of pages
of the history of that.

01:09:19.300 --> 01:09:22.569 align:middle line:84%
And science goes, we think
there might have been giants.

01:09:22.569 --> 01:09:23.560 align:middle line:90%
[AUDIENCE CHUCKLES]

01:09:23.560 --> 01:09:25.990 align:middle line:90%
Now let's go to aliens.

01:09:25.990 --> 01:09:29.020 align:middle line:84%
Well, we think there
might be aliens.

01:09:29.020 --> 01:09:32.393 align:middle line:84%
1947, comes along, says, oh,
no, they're weather balloons.

01:09:32.393 --> 01:09:34.060 align:middle line:84%
I've never seen a
weather balloon alien,

01:09:34.060 --> 01:09:36.340 align:middle line:90%
but they say they exist.

01:09:36.340 --> 01:09:37.839 align:middle line:90%
But here we go.

01:09:37.839 --> 01:09:39.819 align:middle line:84%
Well, what about the
Seneca, and the sky

01:09:39.819 --> 01:09:42.130 align:middle line:84%
canoes, and traveling
the Milky Way,

01:09:42.130 --> 01:09:46.390 align:middle line:84%
the White River that goes on,
or are traveling the Red Road.

01:09:46.390 --> 01:09:48.580 align:middle line:84%
And I mean, we'll tell
you all kinds of things.

01:09:48.580 --> 01:09:51.100 align:middle line:84%
They've been coming here
for thousands years.

01:09:51.100 --> 01:09:52.090 align:middle line:90%
Why don't you ask us?

01:09:52.090 --> 01:09:53.715 align:middle line:84%
And the answer is,
we don't believe you

01:09:53.715 --> 01:09:55.960 align:middle line:90%
because you're Indians.

01:09:55.960 --> 01:09:58.430 align:middle line:84%
And obviously it takes a
white man and a white book

01:09:58.430 --> 01:09:59.230 align:middle line:90%
to be able to--

01:09:59.230 --> 01:10:01.180 align:middle line:90%
I mean, I'm kind of being rude.

01:10:01.180 --> 01:10:04.000 align:middle line:90%
But I'm telling the truth.

01:10:04.000 --> 01:10:07.600 align:middle line:84%
And so now we have what's
called confirmation bias.

01:10:07.600 --> 01:10:10.900 align:middle line:84%
Everybody here wants to
know, where's the ETs at?

01:10:10.900 --> 01:10:12.640 align:middle line:84%
Well, they're all
over the place.

01:10:12.640 --> 01:10:15.010 align:middle line:84%
You can get some
night vision goggles

01:10:15.010 --> 01:10:17.590 align:middle line:84%
and start being able to
see things like that.

01:10:17.590 --> 01:10:21.720 align:middle line:84%
But Native Americans always knew
they were there, from a child.

01:10:21.720 --> 01:10:24.280 align:middle line:84%
Out on the reservation,
one of the elders

01:10:24.280 --> 01:10:28.900 align:middle line:84%
said, you know, there's
people there in that mountain.

01:10:28.900 --> 01:10:32.650 align:middle line:84%
And the word he used
didn't mean human.

01:10:32.650 --> 01:10:36.410 align:middle line:84%
And I went-- and he
goes, no, it's true.

01:10:36.410 --> 01:10:38.590 align:middle line:90%
I speak from the heart.

01:10:38.590 --> 01:10:40.640 align:middle line:90%
And I went, OK.

01:10:40.640 --> 01:10:43.520 align:middle line:84%
I don't question that
he's telling the truth.

01:10:43.520 --> 01:10:45.500 align:middle line:84%
If you can't discern
the truth, you

01:10:45.500 --> 01:10:49.160 align:middle line:84%
have to believe what
anybody tells you.

01:10:49.160 --> 01:10:50.480 align:middle line:90%
I love you.

01:10:50.480 --> 01:10:51.742 align:middle line:90%

[CHUCKLES]

01:10:53.550 --> 01:10:55.070 align:middle line:90%
You see how that works?

01:10:55.070 --> 01:10:56.930 align:middle line:84%
You want to be able
to discern the truth.

01:10:56.930 --> 01:10:59.360 align:middle line:84%
If you learn anything
here, you look

01:10:59.360 --> 01:11:02.030 align:middle line:84%
at the number of people
that speak and stuff,

01:11:02.030 --> 01:11:05.540 align:middle line:84%
you want to learn who
speaks the truth to you.

01:11:05.540 --> 01:11:08.630 align:middle line:84%
Because if you don't
learn to do that,

01:11:08.630 --> 01:11:11.660 align:middle line:90%
we say you'll be of two minds.

01:11:11.660 --> 01:11:15.320 align:middle line:84%
And what that means,
you'll be caught.

01:11:15.320 --> 01:11:17.780 align:middle line:84%
You'll be stuck between the
animate and the inanimate.

01:11:17.780 --> 01:11:20.133 align:middle line:90%
You'll be stuck between--

01:11:20.133 --> 01:11:21.050 align:middle line:90%
what did they call it?

01:11:21.050 --> 01:11:24.200 align:middle line:90%
Manifest destiny and free will.

01:11:24.200 --> 01:11:30.660 align:middle line:84%
I mean, this has played out-- we
called the the twins in Navajo.

01:11:30.660 --> 01:11:34.010 align:middle line:84%
There's this concept
play between positive

01:11:34.010 --> 01:11:37.080 align:middle line:90%
and negative and good and evil.

01:11:37.080 --> 01:11:39.980 align:middle line:84%
And once you
actually explore it,

01:11:39.980 --> 01:11:43.370 align:middle line:84%
you become less enamored
of the good or the bad,

01:11:43.370 --> 01:11:46.190 align:middle line:84%
but you tend to become biased
towards, let's say, the good.

01:11:46.190 --> 01:11:49.880 align:middle line:84%
To be a good person
is to be a good human.

01:11:49.880 --> 01:11:50.680 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

01:11:50.680 --> 01:11:52.190 align:middle line:90%
We'll go here first, OK.

01:11:52.190 --> 01:11:53.530 align:middle line:84%
>> Say, people that don't
believe in aliens or people

01:11:53.530 --> 01:11:54.590 align:middle line:90%
that are open to them--

01:11:54.590 --> 01:11:56.845 align:middle line:84%
one of my biggest questions
is, I'm open to it 100%

01:11:56.845 --> 01:11:58.970 align:middle line:84%
because there's so many
different things out there.

01:11:58.970 --> 01:12:02.820 align:middle line:10%
But how are they so well
hidden that even someone like

01:12:02.820 --> 01:12:04.560 align:middle line:10%
myself has never seen them?

01:12:04.560 --> 01:12:06.790 align:middle line:84%
And why are they
coming here to save--

01:12:06.790 --> 01:12:08.040 align:middle line:90%
or talk to more of us?

01:12:08.040 --> 01:12:10.090 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, we have to
evolve, first of all.

01:12:10.090 --> 01:12:14.970 align:middle line:84%
We're not at that level yet to
have a conversation where they

01:12:14.970 --> 01:12:16.620 align:middle line:90%
are going to come down and--

01:12:16.620 --> 01:12:20.490 align:middle line:84%
everyone wants them to come down
and save all of our problems.

01:12:20.490 --> 01:12:23.630 align:middle line:84%
You have to understand,
too, that they were once us.

01:12:23.630 --> 01:12:26.400 align:middle line:84%
So they're very
compassionate about what's

01:12:26.400 --> 01:12:27.510 align:middle line:90%
going on down here.

01:12:27.510 --> 01:12:29.910 align:middle line:90%
But we're destroying the planet.

01:12:29.910 --> 01:12:32.380 align:middle line:84%
We're not conscious
enough yet at that level.

01:12:32.380 --> 01:12:34.980 align:middle line:90%
Not-- I mean, all of you are.

01:12:34.980 --> 01:12:36.540 align:middle line:90%

[AUDIENCE CHUCKLES]

01:12:37.530 --> 01:12:41.610 align:middle line:84%
But the majority of the
planet still needs to--

01:12:41.610 --> 01:12:44.520 align:middle line:84%
we're only as conscious
as some of the most

01:12:44.520 --> 01:12:46.450 align:middle line:84%
lowest-conscious
people on the planet.

01:12:46.450 --> 01:12:50.460 align:middle line:84%
So we have to bring everyone
up to a certain level

01:12:50.460 --> 01:12:53.010 align:middle line:84%
in the community so
we can get along.

01:12:53.010 --> 01:12:55.800 align:middle line:84%
And if we can't even
accept ourselves,

01:12:55.800 --> 01:12:59.360 align:middle line:84%
I mean, how are you going to
accept an extraterrestrial?

01:12:59.360 --> 01:13:00.160 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

01:13:00.160 --> 01:13:01.160 align:middle line:90%
I agree.

01:13:01.160 --> 01:13:07.620 align:middle line:84%
And another aspect of
that is the language

01:13:07.620 --> 01:13:13.730 align:middle line:84%
is, "if conditions in the
field are appropriate."

01:13:13.730 --> 01:13:20.100 align:middle line:84%
I tell bad jokes, but people
who are non-native go hunting,

01:13:20.100 --> 01:13:23.700 align:middle line:84%
and natives go
where the deer is.

01:13:23.700 --> 01:13:24.700 align:middle line:90%
We go where the fish is.

01:13:24.700 --> 01:13:25.867 align:middle line:90%
We don't have to go hunt it.

01:13:25.867 --> 01:13:26.940 align:middle line:90%
We know where they are.

01:13:26.940 --> 01:13:28.680 align:middle line:84%
We've already been
talking to them.

01:13:28.680 --> 01:13:31.320 align:middle line:84%
If I'm hunting for something
that doesn't exist here,

01:13:31.320 --> 01:13:33.050 align:middle line:90%
you're never going to see it.

01:13:33.050 --> 01:13:36.300 align:middle line:84%
You have to be somewhere
where conditions in the field

01:13:36.300 --> 01:13:39.030 align:middle line:90%
manifest that as a potentiality.

01:13:39.030 --> 01:13:40.740 align:middle line:84%
And this is a problem
with all the people

01:13:40.740 --> 01:13:43.770 align:middle line:84%
that wanted to teach you
manifestation and stuff.

01:13:43.770 --> 01:13:45.490 align:middle line:90%
It may not be available.

01:13:45.490 --> 01:13:49.950 align:middle line:84%

there is something out there

besides us, number one.

So if you don't believe in
that, well, then you just

01:13:54.930 --> 01:13:57.780 align:middle line:84%
blocked yourself
from ever seeing it.

01:13:57.780 --> 01:14:00.213 align:middle line:84%
And that goes with
just life in general.

01:14:00.213 --> 01:14:02.130 align:middle line:84%
If you believe you want
to have a Lamborghini,

01:14:02.130 --> 01:14:04.040 align:middle line:90%
you will get a Lamborghini.

01:14:04.040 --> 01:14:06.360 align:middle line:84%
But if you don't, you
question these things

01:14:06.360 --> 01:14:09.990 align:middle line:84%
and the manifestation
will not happen.

01:14:09.990 --> 01:14:13.980 align:middle line:84%
And that has to do also with
peace around the planet.

01:14:13.980 --> 01:14:15.600 align:middle line:84%
And it has to do
with communication

01:14:15.600 --> 01:14:16.690 align:middle line:90%
with extraterrestrials.

01:14:16.690 --> 01:14:21.240 align:middle line:84%
So I implore all of you to go
home tonight and say out loud

that you are ready
to make contact.

01:14:24.660 --> 01:14:26.530 align:middle line:84%
And are you ready
to make contact?

01:14:26.530 --> 01:14:29.675 align:middle line:84%
Because there's many times
we've taken people out in media,

01:14:29.675 --> 01:14:31.050 align:middle line:84%

comes, they're

01:14:31.050 --> 01:14:32.735 align:middle line:90%

01:14:34.010 --> 01:14:38.670 align:middle line:10%

for almost anything is not

the language of desire--

"I want to" or anything--
it's like I'm open to it.

01:14:44.140 --> 01:14:48.120 align:middle line:10%
If you need a better job,
better wife, husband, child,

01:14:48.120 --> 01:14:50.400 align:middle line:10%
it's like, I'm open to
having a different one.

01:14:50.400 --> 01:14:51.608 align:middle line:10%
>> Cat.

01:14:51.608 --> 01:14:52.650 align:middle line:10%
>> Yeah, a different cat.

01:14:52.650 --> 01:14:54.450 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

01:14:54.450 --> 01:15:02.580 align:middle line:84%
But the act of saying that is
what we call divine intention.

01:15:02.580 --> 01:15:07.650 align:middle line:84%
If you have divine
intention to see things

01:15:07.650 --> 01:15:11.100 align:middle line:84%
that exist that are not
in the number one reality,

01:15:11.100 --> 01:15:15.900 align:middle line:84%
or to interact, you
have stated your intent.

01:15:15.900 --> 01:15:18.900 align:middle line:84%
And then we see how
the universe responds.

01:15:18.900 --> 01:15:21.910 align:middle line:84%
Because really that's
the universe we live in.

01:15:21.910 --> 01:15:27.210 align:middle line:84%
And if you are open to then
you will tend to see that more.

01:15:27.210 --> 01:15:30.320 align:middle line:84%
You will tend to
have that experience.

01:15:30.320 --> 01:15:32.630 align:middle line:84%
So there's a different
way of looking.

01:15:32.630 --> 01:15:35.830 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, and you can't
have any fear, too.

01:15:35.830 --> 01:15:38.940 align:middle line:84%
Because the fear is
another block of program.

01:15:38.940 --> 01:15:42.000 align:middle line:84%
And if you have
any fear about what

01:15:42.000 --> 01:15:45.300 align:middle line:84%
may happen if you did
see one or a craft--

01:15:45.300 --> 01:15:49.170 align:middle line:84%
we've had, many times, out
on our contact expeditions,

01:15:49.170 --> 01:15:53.040 align:middle line:84%
30, 40, 50 people,
sometimes even 100.

01:15:53.040 --> 01:15:55.710 align:middle line:90%
And smaller groups are better.

01:15:55.710 --> 01:15:58.200 align:middle line:84%
Because when everyone's
more cohesive

01:15:58.200 --> 01:16:03.360 align:middle line:84%
and on the same frequency, and
everyone is ready for that--

01:16:03.360 --> 01:16:07.350 align:middle line:84%
we had one person that was
not ready in a smaller group.

01:16:07.350 --> 01:16:09.870 align:middle line:90%
And the craft started coming in.

01:16:09.870 --> 01:16:12.598 align:middle line:84%
And this person started
having some anxiety.

01:16:12.598 --> 01:16:13.515 align:middle line:90%
And the craft stopped.

01:16:13.515 --> 01:16:16.050 align:middle line:90%


01:16:16.050 --> 01:16:18.420 align:middle line:84%
Now, we were all ready,
the rest of the group.

01:16:18.420 --> 01:16:22.180 align:middle line:84%
But they're not here
to install fear.

01:16:22.180 --> 01:16:25.170 align:middle line:10%
And so what I'm getting at
is you have to be prepared

01:16:25.170 --> 01:16:29.430 align:middle line:10%
and have make sure you're not
fearful of this encounter.

01:16:29.430 --> 01:16:32.070 align:middle line:84%
Because they don't
want you to have a bad

01:16:32.070 --> 01:16:34.560 align:middle line:90%
experience the first time.

01:16:34.560 --> 01:16:37.660 align:middle line:84%
And you need to get
out and look up.

01:16:37.660 --> 01:16:41.923 align:middle line:84%
How many people have seen the
stars in the last 24 hours?

01:16:41.923 --> 01:16:44.340 align:middle line:84%
And that's what I'm getting
at, is we have to be prepared.

01:16:44.340 --> 01:16:47.360 align:middle line:10%
You actually have to
be prepared physically.

01:16:47.360 --> 01:16:49.640 align:middle line:84%
You have to be
prepared mentally.

01:16:49.640 --> 01:16:52.070 align:middle line:84%
And your etheric
field has to be ready.

01:16:52.070 --> 01:16:54.690 align:middle line:90%
Like if you're not yourself--

01:16:54.690 --> 01:16:56.640 align:middle line:90%
you have to be yourself.

01:16:56.640 --> 01:16:59.210 align:middle line:90%
And it's really important.

01:16:59.210 --> 01:17:03.320 align:middle line:84%
>> Contractual obligations,
we don't think about.

01:17:03.320 --> 01:17:04.850 align:middle line:90%
We're born with some.

01:17:04.850 --> 01:17:09.710 align:middle line:84%
And some people refer to that
as karma and different things.

01:17:09.710 --> 01:17:13.460 align:middle line:84%
But people that get
abducted are not special.

01:17:13.460 --> 01:17:15.290 align:middle line:90%
That's my language.

01:17:15.290 --> 01:17:19.040 align:middle line:90%
They are convenient.

01:17:19.040 --> 01:17:22.520 align:middle line:84%
So if you think
about, you drive down

01:17:22.520 --> 01:17:25.850 align:middle line:84%
the street and people
that have car wrecks,

01:17:25.850 --> 01:17:28.790 align:middle line:84%
they were available
for a car wreck.

01:17:28.790 --> 01:17:32.910 align:middle line:84%
And the car behind you and the
car in front of you wasn't.

01:17:32.910 --> 01:17:36.980 align:middle line:84%
And it gets into the
dynamics of what you need

01:17:36.980 --> 01:17:40.010 align:middle line:90%
to experience in this life.

01:17:40.010 --> 01:17:42.230 align:middle line:84%
So we could say some
people experience

01:17:42.230 --> 01:17:47.630 align:middle line:84%
alien abduction or interactions
and some people don't, but not

01:17:47.630 --> 01:17:51.410 align:middle line:84%
necessarily because
they had made a contract

01:17:51.410 --> 01:17:55.260 align:middle line:84%
or were special, it's just they
were available at that time

01:17:56.060 --> 01:17:58.400 align:middle line:84%
That's why I broke
down time into aspects,

01:17:58.400 --> 01:18:00.150 align:middle line:90%
and space and stuff.

01:18:00.150 --> 01:18:03.500 align:middle line:10%
And as a martial art, I teach
the ultimate martial art--

01:18:03.500 --> 01:18:04.710 align:middle line:10%
don't be there.

01:18:04.710 --> 01:18:05.700 align:middle line:10%
[CHUCKLES]

01:18:05.700 --> 01:18:06.500 align:middle line:10%


01:18:06.500 --> 01:18:09.440 align:middle line:10%
And what I'm talking
about is time dilation.

01:18:09.440 --> 01:18:12.380 align:middle line:10%
We call it timing under heaven.

01:18:12.380 --> 01:18:14.810 align:middle line:10%
And what that means
is, don't be there.

01:18:14.810 --> 01:18:18.560 align:middle line:84%
If there's going
to be a fight, then

01:18:18.560 --> 01:18:20.750 align:middle line:84%
show up 10 minutes
after the fight

01:18:20.750 --> 01:18:24.290 align:middle line:84%
ended, or leave five minutes
before the fight started.

01:18:24.290 --> 01:18:30.050 align:middle line:84%
Because it's going to happen
in a temporal-spatial event.

01:18:30.050 --> 01:18:33.530 align:middle line:84%
And you literally do still
have choice not to be there.

01:18:33.530 --> 01:18:36.500 align:middle line:84%
You've had the feeling, oh, I
shouldn't go through the light,

01:18:36.500 --> 01:18:38.030 align:middle line:90%
and the wreck occurs.

01:18:38.030 --> 01:18:43.220 align:middle line:84%
Oh, I shouldn't marry that
person, or buy that dog or cat.

01:18:43.220 --> 01:18:46.640 align:middle line:84%
It's always available to
you what the truth of it is.

01:18:46.640 --> 01:18:51.440 align:middle line:84%
It's that our mind doesn't
want to go along because we

01:18:51.440 --> 01:18:53.730 align:middle line:90%
can't discern the truth of it.

01:18:53.730 --> 01:18:56.960 align:middle line:84%
So if you want to have
an alien interaction

01:18:56.960 --> 01:18:58.730 align:middle line:90%
or anything like that--

01:18:58.730 --> 01:19:02.540 align:middle line:84%
ET-- it would be like
by being open to it,

01:19:02.540 --> 01:19:06.530 align:middle line:84%
it's available if conditions
in the field are appropriate

01:19:06.530 --> 01:19:10.880 align:middle line:84%
and if you can end up at the
place where that happens.

01:19:10.880 --> 01:19:13.190 align:middle line:84%
You know when Roswell
occurred, there

01:19:13.190 --> 01:19:18.020 align:middle line:84%
was about three ranchers in
that area that showed up.

01:19:18.020 --> 01:19:19.310 align:middle line:90%
They were available.

01:19:19.310 --> 01:19:20.570 align:middle line:90%
They were proximate.

01:19:20.570 --> 01:19:23.210 align:middle line:90%


01:19:23.210 --> 01:19:29.090 align:middle line:84%
But the rest of the world wasn't
there because of just a time

01:19:29.090 --> 01:19:31.130 align:middle line:90%
thing.

01:19:31.130 --> 01:19:36.650 align:middle line:84%
So as a martial art, to avoid
all pain and all problems is

01:19:36.650 --> 01:19:37.910 align:middle line:90%
don't be there.

01:19:37.910 --> 01:19:39.380 align:middle line:10%
Just skip it.

01:19:39.380 --> 01:19:41.420 align:middle line:10%
Under the circumstances,
you were not

01:19:41.420 --> 01:19:44.300 align:middle line:10%
able to exert an influence
that was great enough to change

01:19:44.300 --> 01:19:46.850 align:middle line:10%
the reality you were in.

01:19:46.850 --> 01:19:50.480 align:middle line:10%
So you need to acknowledge
that you weren't

01:19:50.480 --> 01:19:53.390 align:middle line:10%
special to see ETs or anything.

01:19:53.390 --> 01:19:55.170 align:middle line:90%
You were convenient to it.

I decided I wanted to

I'm open to being married.

all abductions are staged,

They smelled the same smells.

Well, that is a typical
protocol that we would do--

01:22:33.920 --> 01:22:39.425 align:middle line:10%
because I want to make sure,
when I abduct somebody--

01:22:39.425 --> 01:22:41.720 align:middle line:10%
and I'm talking like them--

01:22:41.720 --> 01:22:45.660 align:middle line:10%

So when the scientists
and doctors come in

01:22:48.980 --> 01:22:52.160 align:middle line:84%
to interview these people,
that the person that

01:22:52.160 --> 01:22:57.140 align:middle line:84%
was abducted in Oklahoma had
the same exact experience

01:22:57.140 --> 01:23:00.080 align:middle line:84%
as the person who got
abducted in Zimbabwe,

01:23:00.080 --> 01:23:02.420 align:middle line:84%
who had the same exact
experience that got--

01:23:02.420 --> 01:23:05.000 align:middle line:84%
the person abducted
in the Philippines.

01:23:05.000 --> 01:23:07.670 align:middle line:84%
Because these are totally
different cultures.

And they want they want to
have this fear-based thing

led up to me having
my opinion that this

01:23:42.390 --> 01:23:46.100 align:middle line:84%
could be one possible agenda
that they're doing this for.

hundreds of thousands

01:23:48.270 --> 01:23:50.400 align:middle line:84%
of people going
missing every year,

01:23:50.400 --> 01:23:52.110 align:middle line:90%
but nobody talks about it.

01:23:52.110 --> 01:23:54.870 align:middle line:90%
And that really baffles me.

01:23:54.870 --> 01:23:57.470 align:middle line:84%
>> It's a phenomenal number,
much greater than anybody

01:23:57.470 --> 01:23:58.270 align:middle line:90%
knows.

01:23:58.270 --> 01:24:01.780 align:middle line:10%
>> But it's never talked about,
which now raises the flag

01:24:01.780 --> 01:24:04.060 align:middle line:10%
for me that media doesn't
want to report this

01:24:04.060 --> 01:24:06.390 align:middle line:10%
because they're
being controlled.

01:24:06.390 --> 01:24:08.270 align:middle line:90%
These things are happening.

01:24:08.270 --> 01:24:10.180 align:middle line:84%
And these people are
being taken somewhere.

01:24:10.180 --> 01:24:12.430 align:middle line:84%
Some people are just
going missing because they

01:24:12.430 --> 01:24:13.780 align:middle line:90%
are being experimented on.

01:24:13.780 --> 01:24:16.930 align:middle line:84%
And then I hate to talk negative
about some of the things that

01:24:16.930 --> 01:24:17.892 align:middle line:90%
are going around--

01:24:17.892 --> 01:24:19.600 align:middle line:84%
that are happening
around on this planet.

01:24:19.600 --> 01:24:21.642 align:middle line:84%
But they are
definitely doing that.

01:24:21.642 --> 01:24:22.890 align:middle line:90%
Mm-hmm.

01:24:22.890 --> 01:24:24.800 align:middle line:84%
>> But how did the
extraterrestrials help you

01:24:24.800 --> 01:24:26.950 align:middle line:90%
and your crew?

01:24:26.950 --> 01:24:29.380 align:middle line:84%
>> I think, you know,
I was listening--

01:24:29.380 --> 01:24:32.830 align:middle line:84%
and going back to the story,
when I was about 7 years

01:24:32.830 --> 01:24:36.670 align:middle line:84%
of age, and I remember having
this urge to get out of bed

01:24:36.670 --> 01:24:37.610 align:middle line:90%
around 9:30.

01:24:37.610 --> 01:24:40.750 align:middle line:84%
I usually go to bed around
7:30, 8 o'clock at that age,

01:24:40.750 --> 01:24:41.810 align:middle line:90%
on the farm.

01:24:41.810 --> 01:24:42.610 align:middle line:90%
And we went out.

01:24:42.610 --> 01:24:43.670 align:middle line:90%
I went outside.

01:24:43.670 --> 01:24:46.900 align:middle line:84%
And we had this lake
in front of our house.

01:24:46.900 --> 01:24:49.570 align:middle line:84%
And something was
not telling me,

01:24:49.570 --> 01:24:53.350 align:middle line:84%
but I just had the
urge to go outside,

01:24:53.350 --> 01:24:55.240 align:middle line:84%
which is not normal
for me at that age

01:24:55.240 --> 01:24:56.740 align:middle line:90%
to just walk out of the house.

01:24:56.740 --> 01:25:01.840 align:middle line:84%
And I walked out and saw
this light above the lake.

01:25:01.840 --> 01:25:03.730 align:middle line:90%
And it formed into a sphere.

01:25:03.730 --> 01:25:06.610 align:middle line:84%
And that sphere
formed into an oval.

01:25:06.610 --> 01:25:09.250 align:middle line:84%
And then inside
that oval, I could

01:25:09.250 --> 01:25:15.980 align:middle line:84%
see three humanoid figures
that had very white skin.

01:25:15.980 --> 01:25:19.690 align:middle line:90%
And then just fixated on it.

01:25:19.690 --> 01:25:23.170 align:middle line:84%
I started having this
communication come in and out

01:25:23.170 --> 01:25:26.680 align:middle line:84%
from this ship,
from these people.

01:25:26.680 --> 01:25:27.900 align:middle line:90%
And I can't explain it.

01:25:27.900 --> 01:25:30.762 align:middle line:84%
That was my first kind of
telepathy thing going on.

01:25:30.762 --> 01:25:32.470 align:middle line:84%
Of course I always
talked to the chickens

01:25:32.470 --> 01:25:33.850 align:middle line:90%
every morning with the corn.

01:25:33.850 --> 01:25:36.865 align:middle line:90%
They liked the corn.

01:25:36.865 --> 01:25:39.820 align:middle line:90%
And what was interesting is--

01:25:39.820 --> 01:25:42.850 align:middle line:90%
this went on for a few minutes.

01:25:42.850 --> 01:25:43.850 align:middle line:90%
And it normal.

01:25:43.850 --> 01:25:44.650 align:middle line:90%
I wasn't scared.

01:25:44.650 --> 01:25:47.270 align:middle line:90%


01:25:47.270 --> 01:25:49.460 align:middle line:84%
It was like talking
to someone I knew.

01:25:49.460 --> 01:25:54.560 align:middle line:84%
I had a very good vibratory
frequency link with them

01:25:54.560 --> 01:25:56.620 align:middle line:90%
that I didn't feel scared.

01:25:56.620 --> 01:25:58.940 align:middle line:84%
And I probably
maybe should have.

01:25:58.940 --> 01:26:00.200 align:middle line:90%
But that's not what I felt.

01:26:00.200 --> 01:26:01.850 align:middle line:84%
So I went back
inside and did what

01:26:01.850 --> 01:26:04.100 align:middle line:90%
every 7-year-old kid should do.

01:26:04.100 --> 01:26:07.250 align:middle line:84%
And I went and banged on
my mom and dad's door.

01:26:07.250 --> 01:26:09.740 align:middle line:90%
And they were inside the room.

01:26:09.740 --> 01:26:11.425 align:middle line:90%
And I walked up to the bed.

01:26:11.425 --> 01:26:12.800 align:middle line:84%
And they were
like, what's wrong?

01:26:12.800 --> 01:26:13.440 align:middle line:90%
What are you doing?

01:26:13.440 --> 01:26:15.232 align:middle line:84%
I said, well, there's
a spacecraft outside,

01:26:15.232 --> 01:26:16.730 align:middle line:90%
over the lake.

01:26:16.730 --> 01:26:20.030 align:middle line:84%
They said, OK, just don't
tell anyone at school about it

01:26:20.030 --> 01:26:21.662 align:middle line:90%
tomorrow.

01:26:21.662 --> 01:26:22.620 align:middle line:90%
Just don't tell anyone.

01:26:22.620 --> 01:26:25.250 align:middle line:84%
And I said, OK, just wanted
to let you guys know,

01:26:25.250 --> 01:26:26.870 align:middle line:90%
and went back to bed.

01:26:26.870 --> 01:26:32.280 align:middle line:84%
>> OK, how many people
here have seen an ET?

01:26:32.280 --> 01:26:33.080 align:middle line:90%
Think about that.

01:26:33.080 --> 01:26:35.690 align:middle line:90%


01:26:35.690 --> 01:26:37.460 align:middle line:90%
I was 11 years old.

01:26:37.460 --> 01:26:43.020 align:middle line:84%
And I look up, and I was
already enamored of science,

01:26:43.020 --> 01:26:45.120 align:middle line:84%
and I knew that
that wasn't right.

01:26:45.120 --> 01:26:47.570 align:middle line:84%
That's the only way
you can describe it.

01:26:47.570 --> 01:26:50.780 align:middle line:90%
And then you go through life.

01:26:50.780 --> 01:26:54.700 align:middle line:84%
And how many people have blank
spots of two or three days?

01:26:54.700 --> 01:26:56.150 align:middle line:90%
Anybody here?

01:26:56.150 --> 01:26:58.430 align:middle line:90%
Right, yeah.

01:26:58.430 --> 01:26:59.570 align:middle line:90%
>> I mean, I don't know.

01:26:59.570 --> 01:27:00.370 align:middle line:90%
>> I don't know.

01:27:00.370 --> 01:27:01.250 align:middle line:90%
That's exactly right.

01:27:01.250 --> 01:27:03.440 align:middle line:90%
And I had the same experience.

01:27:03.440 --> 01:27:06.890 align:middle line:84%
From one point to the
other, it is totally blank.

01:27:06.890 --> 01:27:11.660 align:middle line:84%
And the human mind abhors
a vacuum, blank spot

01:27:11.660 --> 01:27:12.860 align:middle line:90%
in our consciousness.

01:27:12.860 --> 01:27:14.710 align:middle line:90%
We literally can't stand it.

01:27:14.710 --> 01:27:19.420 align:middle line:84%
And I have no way to account
for those three days.

01:27:19.420 --> 01:27:25.610 align:middle line:84%
So the opportunity-- but
I'm sure everybody here

01:27:25.610 --> 01:27:29.510 align:middle line:84%
has seen an ET, they just didn't
know what they were looking at,

01:27:29.510 --> 01:27:33.020 align:middle line:84%
or they kind of like got
erased and don't remember it

01:27:33.020 --> 01:27:34.670 align:middle line:90%
or didn't recognize it.

01:27:34.670 --> 01:27:37.378 align:middle line:84%
But it's not that there were
just a half-dozen or a dozen

01:27:37.378 --> 01:27:38.420 align:middle line:90%
people that have seen it.

01:27:38.420 --> 01:27:40.310 align:middle line:84%
I promise you
everyone has seen one.

01:27:40.310 --> 01:27:41.910 align:middle line:90%
They just may not have known it.

01:27:41.910 --> 01:27:46.250 align:middle line:84%
>> The other thing is that they
have the ability now, guys,

01:27:46.250 --> 01:27:48.230 align:middle line:84%
through very
advanced technology,

01:27:48.230 --> 01:27:51.290 align:middle line:84%
through satellites and
other scalar in photometry

01:27:51.290 --> 01:27:55.370 align:middle line:84%
to mind-control people, and
put imprints of memories

01:27:55.370 --> 01:27:58.820 align:middle line:84%
in your head that
never really existed.

01:27:58.820 --> 01:28:01.460 align:middle line:84%
>> But remember, we
have confirmation bias.

01:28:01.460 --> 01:28:04.010 align:middle line:84%
We want somebody in
authority and a white coat

01:28:04.010 --> 01:28:06.920 align:middle line:84%
or in a suit to tell
us what the truth is.

01:28:06.920 --> 01:28:08.960 align:middle line:90%
Native Americans never had that.

01:28:08.960 --> 01:28:13.290 align:middle line:84%
It's like the ability to discern
the truth is ingrained in us.

01:28:13.290 --> 01:28:15.320 align:middle line:84%
And you know that
because we tell

01:28:15.320 --> 01:28:17.820 align:middle line:90%
a lot of stories and bad jokes.

01:28:17.820 --> 01:28:18.900 align:middle line:90%
[CHUCKLES]

01:28:18.900 --> 01:28:21.260 align:middle line:84%
But they're meant
to teach you to be

01:28:21.260 --> 01:28:24.290 align:middle line:84%
able to discern the truth
of what somebody tells you.

01:28:24.290 --> 01:28:27.200 align:middle line:84%
Because that's a skill
you need in life.

01:28:27.200 --> 01:28:29.910 align:middle line:84%
I tell people, men
will lie to you.

01:28:29.910 --> 01:28:31.580 align:middle line:90%
And then the women--

01:28:31.580 --> 01:28:33.660 align:middle line:84%
I mean, the men, I go,
women will lie to you.

01:28:33.660 --> 01:28:34.940 align:middle line:90%
You see what I mean?

01:28:34.940 --> 01:28:36.260 align:middle line:90%
It doesn't make any difference.

01:28:36.260 --> 01:28:38.030 align:middle line:84%
You have to learn to
discern the truth.

01:28:38.030 --> 01:28:39.800 align:middle line:10%
It's probably the
primary skill set

01:28:39.800 --> 01:28:42.710 align:middle line:10%
you can do to help yourself.

01:28:42.710 --> 01:28:45.680 align:middle line:84%
If you see ET or
see something that

01:28:45.680 --> 01:28:47.480 align:middle line:84%
is not visible to
other people, you

01:28:47.480 --> 01:28:48.695 align:middle line:90%
don't need to doubt yourself.

01:28:48.695 --> 01:28:51.650 align:middle line:90%


01:28:51.650 --> 01:28:54.600 align:middle line:84%
I can discern the truth
that what I saw was true.

01:28:54.600 --> 01:28:57.440 align:middle line:84%
But when you go
to a movie, you're

01:28:57.440 --> 01:29:03.230 align:middle line:84%
also seeing a form of truth,
but it's not as complete.

01:29:03.230 --> 01:29:07.110 align:middle line:84%
Your ability to know
it is not the same.

01:29:07.110 --> 01:29:10.460 align:middle line:84%
And that's why of all
things like internet images

01:29:10.460 --> 01:29:14.310 align:middle line:90%
and things, they're not true.

01:29:14.310 --> 01:29:16.250 align:middle line:84%
They're one-dimensional--
that's the language

01:29:16.250 --> 01:29:17.630 align:middle line:90%
we use-- or two-dimensional.

01:29:17.630 --> 01:29:20.330 align:middle line:90%
They're just an image.

01:29:20.330 --> 01:29:23.090 align:middle line:84%
Try to pet a picture
of a cat on the screen.

01:29:23.090 --> 01:29:28.160 align:middle line:84%
You will not get the feedback of
the truth of that the same way

01:29:28.160 --> 01:29:29.990 align:middle line:90%
as if you petted that cat.

01:29:29.990 --> 01:29:36.170 align:middle line:84%
So we have ways to start
being aware enough to go,

01:29:36.170 --> 01:29:38.210 align:middle line:90%
I'm not affected by that.

01:29:38.210 --> 01:29:40.370 align:middle line:10%
And then of course
the best way to not be

01:29:40.370 --> 01:29:43.653 align:middle line:10%
affected by everything from 5G
or whatever is to be healthy.

01:29:43.653 --> 01:29:46.070 align:middle line:84%
>> What I've learned a lot
from the extraterrestrials that

01:29:46.070 --> 01:29:51.200 align:middle line:84%
really helped me in life was it
gave me a lot of hope to know

01:29:51.200 --> 01:29:52.210 align:middle line:90%
that.

01:29:52.210 --> 01:29:59.010 align:middle line:84%
You know, this planet can be
fixed, and we can be healed.

01:29:59.010 --> 01:30:01.260 align:middle line:90%
We don't have to have--

01:30:01.260 --> 01:30:03.120 align:middle line:84%
there could be
fresh water and food

01:30:03.120 --> 01:30:05.640 align:middle line:90%
for everyone on this planet.

01:30:05.640 --> 01:30:08.490 align:middle line:84%
And it made me realize,
with this technology that's

01:30:08.490 --> 01:30:14.670 align:middle line:84%
so clean, that there's so
many benefits from this

01:30:14.670 --> 01:30:18.900 align:middle line:84%
to bring us amongst
the stars from here.

01:30:18.900 --> 01:30:22.250 align:middle line:84%
And the compassion
that they have

01:30:22.250 --> 01:30:25.290 align:middle line:84%
is unlike anything
I've ever experienced.

01:30:25.290 --> 01:30:29.520 align:middle line:10%
And there's no secrets with ETs.

01:30:29.520 --> 01:30:32.730 align:middle line:10%
And when we get to that
level here on the planet,

01:30:32.730 --> 01:30:37.160 align:middle line:10%
so much weight will be lifted
from all the presidents

01:30:37.160 --> 01:30:41.120 align:middle line:10%
of all the countries,
from the military.

01:30:41.120 --> 01:30:44.480 align:middle line:84%
Relations will be brought
together because of that.

01:30:44.480 --> 01:30:49.130 align:middle line:84%
Because when everything gets
exposed, people start behaving.

01:30:49.130 --> 01:30:51.320 align:middle line:84%
Ladies and gentlemen,
thank you so much.

01:30:51.320 --> 01:30:53.420 align:middle line:90%
