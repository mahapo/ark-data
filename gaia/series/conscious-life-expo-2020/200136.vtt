00:00:02.415 --> 00:00:06.290 align:middle line:90%


00:00:06.290 --> 00:00:09.410 align:middle line:10%
>> It is my pleasure to
introduce an old, old friend.

00:00:09.410 --> 00:00:10.310 align:middle line:10%
I knew him when--

00:00:10.310 --> 00:00:11.720 align:middle line:10%
I knew him before
he was Avocado.

00:00:11.720 --> 00:00:13.318 align:middle line:10%
[LAUGHTER]

00:00:13.318 --> 00:00:15.110 align:middle line:10%
No, because where did
an avocado come from?

00:00:15.110 --> 00:00:15.910 align:middle line:10%
No.

00:00:15.910 --> 00:00:18.230 align:middle line:10%
We met in New York
in, like, the '90s.

00:00:18.230 --> 00:00:20.990 align:middle line:84%
And David was starting
out his career

00:00:20.990 --> 00:00:26.240 align:middle line:84%
and talking about live
foods and really making

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:30.080 align:middle line:84%
an impact on some of the
local community with what he

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:33.343 align:middle line:84%
would become, a really
live food expert.

00:00:33.343 --> 00:00:34.760 align:middle line:84%
And then he got
into other things.

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:37.580 align:middle line:84%
I told him about Charles Fort
and UFOs, and he got into that.

00:00:37.580 --> 00:00:41.960 align:middle line:10%
But his main focus
is this, it's really

00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:43.520 align:middle line:10%
understanding the
health of the body

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:46.310 align:middle line:10%
and how we're evolving
through taking care of this

00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:50.175 align:middle line:10%
and getting the highest quality
nutrients we can possibly have.

00:00:50.175 --> 00:00:51.800 align:middle line:10%
So before we talk
any more, let's bring

00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:54.335 align:middle line:10%
David "Avocado" Wolfe out here.

00:00:54.335 --> 00:00:56.075 align:middle line:90%
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:56.075 --> 00:00:57.975 align:middle line:90%
There he is, my old friend.

00:00:57.975 --> 00:01:01.186 align:middle line:90%


00:01:01.186 --> 00:01:02.830 align:middle line:84%
>> Let's give it up
for Alan Steinfeld.

00:01:02.830 --> 00:01:05.680 align:middle line:84%
This guy's been there all
along, all those years.

00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:07.900 align:middle line:84%
>> Oh, I have, out in
the trenches, yeah.

00:01:07.900 --> 00:01:08.940 align:middle line:90%
>> In the trenches.

00:01:08.940 --> 00:01:09.740 align:middle line:90%
Thanks, everybody.

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:10.700 align:middle line:90%
Thanks for joining us.

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:11.740 align:middle line:10%
We're going to get
into some great stuff.

00:01:11.740 --> 00:01:13.927 align:middle line:10%
I've got some samples we're
going to be handing out.

00:01:13.927 --> 00:01:15.760 align:middle line:10%
As you know, I've been
at this for 25 years.

00:01:15.760 --> 00:01:17.343 align:middle line:84%
I remember meeting
Alan Steinfeld back

00:01:17.343 --> 00:01:19.270 align:middle line:84%
in the '90s, mid '90s
in New York City.

00:01:19.270 --> 00:01:20.160 align:middle line:90%
>> David Jubb, right?

00:01:20.160 --> 00:01:21.160 align:middle line:90%
>> And David Jubb days.

00:01:21.160 --> 00:01:22.570 align:middle line:90%
And man, we had some fun.

00:01:22.570 --> 00:01:23.770 align:middle line:90%
There were some epoch times.

00:01:23.770 --> 00:01:25.145 align:middle line:84%
And there's just
a few things I'm

00:01:25.145 --> 00:01:26.460 align:middle line:90%
going to share with you today.

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:29.073 align:middle line:84%
My goal is to make the
simplest and easiest steps

00:01:29.073 --> 00:01:31.240 align:middle line:84%
for you that's going to
give you the maximum result.

00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:33.520 align:middle line:84%
That's always been my
result-- or my goal.

00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:34.970 align:middle line:90%
And that's my results for you.

00:01:34.970 --> 00:01:36.640 align:middle line:84%
It's the simplest
and easiest thing

00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:39.730 align:middle line:84%
that Brent Hauver right
here can do every day,

00:01:39.730 --> 00:01:42.440 align:middle line:84%
that make his life better and
improve his quality of life

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:44.350 align:middle line:84%
and actually make his
food digest better

00:01:44.350 --> 00:01:47.245 align:middle line:84%
and make sure that his wife
doesn't have any gas to deal

00:01:47.245 --> 00:01:48.370 align:middle line:90%
with or anything like that.

00:01:48.370 --> 00:01:49.330 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:01:49.330 --> 00:01:50.130 align:middle line:90%
I mean, fuel.

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:53.613 align:middle line:90%
I mean-- you know what I mean.

00:01:53.613 --> 00:01:56.030 align:middle line:84%
So we've got some of those
things we're going to get into.

00:01:56.030 --> 00:01:57.200 align:middle line:90%
And it's really a breakthrough.

00:01:57.200 --> 00:01:58.742 align:middle line:84%
This is really
something interesting.

00:01:58.742 --> 00:02:02.620 align:middle line:84%
In the meantime, I have been
growing avocados since 1978,

00:02:02.620 --> 00:02:03.790 align:middle line:90%
all along.

00:02:03.790 --> 00:02:05.775 align:middle line:84%
And I've been
growing avocados in--

00:02:05.775 --> 00:02:07.150 align:middle line:84%
I started in
Southern California,

00:02:07.150 --> 00:02:08.259 align:middle line:90%
right on the border.

00:02:08.259 --> 00:02:10.030 align:middle line:84%
So we had a wonderful
brunch the other day

00:02:10.030 --> 00:02:13.060 align:middle line:84%
with Carlos Santana
and his wife.

00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:15.550 align:middle line:90%
[AUDIENCE CHEERING]

00:02:15.550 --> 00:02:18.010 align:middle line:84%
That guy, he's been
there all along,

00:02:18.010 --> 00:02:21.640 align:middle line:84%
pushing out the message of we're
transforming fear into love,

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:23.320 align:middle line:84%
right, all along,
transforming fear

00:02:23.320 --> 00:02:24.700 align:middle line:90%
into love and that message.

00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:27.340 align:middle line:84%
And he wants to do a Shamans
Conference in Las Vegas.

00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:28.380 align:middle line:90%
But one of the things--

00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:29.040 align:middle line:90%
I was hanging out with him.

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:30.540 align:middle line:84%
And I was like--
because I knew he's

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:33.790 align:middle line:84%
either Mexican or Californian
Mexican or something.

00:02:33.790 --> 00:02:35.620 align:middle line:84%
And I said, so Carlos,
where are you from?

00:02:35.620 --> 00:02:37.210 align:middle line:90%
And he's like, TJ.

00:02:37.210 --> 00:02:38.770 align:middle line:90%
And the way he said that--

00:02:38.770 --> 00:02:40.210 align:middle line:84%
because I'm from
San Diego, right?

00:02:40.210 --> 00:02:43.312 align:middle line:84%
The way he said that was
like, oh, this dude's from TJ.

00:02:43.312 --> 00:02:45.910 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:02:45.910 --> 00:02:47.860 align:middle line:84%
Just a certain
flair of the accent

00:02:47.860 --> 00:02:50.093 align:middle line:84%
that only people from San
Diego or TJ know, right?

00:02:50.093 --> 00:02:51.760 align:middle line:84%
And I was like, whoa,
he's from Tijuana.

00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:54.700 align:middle line:84%
Now, we grew up right on
the border there, right?

00:02:54.700 --> 00:02:56.320 align:middle line:90%
There was there's that border.

00:02:56.320 --> 00:02:57.440 align:middle line:90%
Then there's a ranch.

00:02:57.440 --> 00:02:59.530 align:middle line:84%
And then there's a road
and then my uncle's farm.

00:02:59.530 --> 00:03:02.080 align:middle line:84%
And that's where I started
growing avocados in 1978.

00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:05.110 align:middle line:84%
We took a family in 1978
that came across the border,

00:03:05.110 --> 00:03:06.737 align:middle line:90%
and they're still there.

00:03:06.737 --> 00:03:07.570 align:middle line:90%
They're still there.

00:03:07.570 --> 00:03:10.028 align:middle line:84%
Mexican family came across the
border, and we took them in,

00:03:10.028 --> 00:03:11.290 align:middle line:90%
and they're still with us.

00:03:11.290 --> 00:03:13.190 align:middle line:84%
And that's the environment
that I grew up in.

00:03:13.190 --> 00:03:14.380 align:middle line:84%
So avocados have
been deep for me.

00:03:14.380 --> 00:03:16.047 align:middle line:84%
This is where I'm at
now with my group--

00:03:16.047 --> 00:03:18.310 align:middle line:90%
with my genetics and growing.

00:03:18.310 --> 00:03:20.680 align:middle line:84%
And that's pretty
good, isn't it?

00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:25.390 align:middle line:10%
We call it the
seed-to-meat ratio, right?

00:03:25.390 --> 00:03:27.760 align:middle line:10%
Little seed and a lot of
meat, that's what you want.

00:03:27.760 --> 00:03:29.300 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:03:29.300 --> 00:03:31.140 align:middle line:84%
This is where we're
grown today in Hawaii.

00:03:31.140 --> 00:03:32.560 align:middle line:90%
So that's my farm in NoniLand.

00:03:32.560 --> 00:03:34.720 align:middle line:84%
And all these
years-- by the way,

00:03:34.720 --> 00:03:36.220 align:middle line:84%
thank you guys so
much for all this.

00:03:36.220 --> 00:03:38.770 align:middle line:10%
Many of you have supported me
for many years, my products,

00:03:38.770 --> 00:03:41.290 align:middle line:10%
all the good things we've been
doing, conferences and stuff.

00:03:41.290 --> 00:03:43.648 align:middle line:10%
And that has put a million
trees in the ground.

00:03:43.648 --> 00:03:45.190 align:middle line:10%
We put a million
trees in the ground.

00:03:45.190 --> 00:03:52.710 align:middle line:10%
Last year, in 2019, we put in
80,0565 trees into the ground.

00:03:52.710 --> 00:03:53.510 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, thanks.

00:03:53.510 --> 00:03:56.470 align:middle line:90%
[APPLAUSE]

00:03:56.470 --> 00:03:57.400 align:middle line:90%
Big year for us.

00:03:57.400 --> 00:03:58.550 align:middle line:90%
I put the last 100.

00:03:58.550 --> 00:04:00.520 align:middle line:84%
And that was in
Hawaii, not here.

00:04:00.520 --> 00:04:01.398 align:middle line:90%
But it was a--

00:04:01.398 --> 00:04:03.190 align:middle line:84%
these are-- this is
the fruit tree planting

00:04:03.190 --> 00:04:04.540 align:middle line:90%
foundation, our nonprofit.

00:04:04.540 --> 00:04:05.470 align:middle line:90%
This is actually on our farm.

00:04:05.470 --> 00:04:06.428 align:middle line:90%
Now, we put many trees.

00:04:06.428 --> 00:04:08.650 align:middle line:84%
We put thousands of
trees in in Hawaii that's

00:04:08.650 --> 00:04:09.970 align:middle line:90%
not part of the nonprofit.

00:04:09.970 --> 00:04:12.220 align:middle line:10%
But as part of our non-profit,
we put a million trees

00:04:12.220 --> 00:04:14.643 align:middle line:10%
in the ground in since 2002.

00:04:14.643 --> 00:04:15.560 align:middle line:90%
So thanks to you guys.

00:04:15.560 --> 00:04:16.360 align:middle line:90%
Thanks so much.

00:04:16.360 --> 00:04:18.480 align:middle line:90%
[APPLAUSE]

00:04:18.480 --> 00:04:20.470 align:middle line:90%


00:04:20.470 --> 00:04:22.550 align:middle line:84%
And this is my other
farm in Ontario, Canada.

00:04:22.550 --> 00:04:23.790 align:middle line:90%
So this is--

00:04:23.790 --> 00:04:24.700 align:middle line:90%
I'm a farmer.

00:04:24.700 --> 00:04:27.625 align:middle line:10%
And I really like to get right
to the brass tacks of it all.

00:04:27.625 --> 00:04:29.520 align:middle line:10%
So one of the things
that were growing here,

00:04:29.520 --> 00:04:31.990 align:middle line:10%
and a big story in the
natural health world,

00:04:31.990 --> 00:04:33.610 align:middle line:10%
a big story in the
cosmetics world--

00:04:33.610 --> 00:04:35.170 align:middle line:10%
it always begins with farming--

00:04:35.170 --> 00:04:36.650 align:middle line:10%
is the sea buckthorn plant.

00:04:36.650 --> 00:04:38.650 align:middle line:10%
You guys may have heard
of sea buckthorn, right?

00:04:38.650 --> 00:04:39.980 align:middle line:10%
It's in all the cosmetics.

00:04:39.980 --> 00:04:41.770 align:middle line:10%
It's the number-one-selling
oil that's

00:04:41.770 --> 00:04:43.990 align:middle line:10%
going into all the
latest skin care.

00:04:43.990 --> 00:04:44.800 align:middle line:10%
You guys into this?

00:04:44.800 --> 00:04:45.600 align:middle line:10%
>> Yes!

00:04:45.600 --> 00:04:48.980 align:middle line:10%
>> Guys are like, [BLUBBERING]
Woman are like, oh, yeah!

00:04:48.980 --> 00:04:50.303 align:middle line:10%
We know!

00:04:50.303 --> 00:04:52.323 align:middle line:10%
[LAUGHTER]

00:04:52.323 --> 00:04:53.740 align:middle line:84%
And what we're
always trying to do

00:04:53.740 --> 00:04:56.080 align:middle line:84%
is just keep working ourselves,
trying to keep going.

00:04:56.080 --> 00:04:58.640 align:middle line:84%
And we're in the process--
that's our good friend Fully

00:04:58.640 --> 00:04:59.440 align:middle line:90%
Raw Kristina.

00:04:59.440 --> 00:05:00.773 align:middle line:90%
You may know Fully Raw Kristina.

00:05:00.773 --> 00:05:02.913 align:middle line:84%
And she wants to
move out to Hawaii.

00:05:02.913 --> 00:05:04.330 align:middle line:84%
So she's going to
be our neighbor.

00:05:04.330 --> 00:05:05.613 align:middle line:90%
We're excited about that.

00:05:05.613 --> 00:05:07.030 align:middle line:84%
But one of things
we like to do is

00:05:07.030 --> 00:05:08.680 align:middle line:84%
we like to just keep
working on ourselves.

00:05:08.680 --> 00:05:09.480 align:middle line:90%
It's never over.

00:05:09.480 --> 00:05:10.570 align:middle line:90%
It's never too late.

00:05:10.570 --> 00:05:13.390 align:middle line:84%
And we're headed for a really
cool cleanse on March 13th.

00:05:13.390 --> 00:05:16.480 align:middle line:84%
March 13th through the 27th
will be our two-week cleanse.

00:05:16.480 --> 00:05:20.590 align:middle line:10%
And then once you get
to day 15, those of you

00:05:20.590 --> 00:05:23.615 align:middle line:10%
who want to keep going, then
with the water fast starts.

00:05:23.615 --> 00:05:25.990 align:middle line:10%
And you're thinking, no, no,
no, I can't do a water fast.

00:05:25.990 --> 00:05:26.890 align:middle line:10%
No, I can't.

00:05:26.890 --> 00:05:27.340 align:middle line:10%
Uh-uh.

00:05:27.340 --> 00:05:27.970 align:middle line:10%
Not me.

00:05:27.970 --> 00:05:28.770 align:middle line:10%
It's like, yep.

00:05:28.770 --> 00:05:31.420 align:middle line:10%
If you do the 14 steps, the
14 days leading up to it,

00:05:31.420 --> 00:05:33.003 align:middle line:10%
you will be able to
do it, absolutely.

00:05:33.003 --> 00:05:34.290 align:middle line:10%
And it'll be easy.

00:05:34.290 --> 00:05:35.890 align:middle line:10%
And you'll be like, jeez, I
got through one day of a water

00:05:35.890 --> 00:05:36.130 align:middle line:10%
fast.

00:05:36.130 --> 00:05:36.580 align:middle line:90%
What?

00:05:36.580 --> 00:05:37.412 align:middle line:84%
Then you go through
the second day.

00:05:37.412 --> 00:05:38.920 align:middle line:84%
It's like, well, I
got through two days.

00:05:38.920 --> 00:05:40.390 align:middle line:84%
Because over the
years we've learned--

00:05:40.390 --> 00:05:41.890 align:middle line:84%
you know I've been
at this 25 years.

00:05:41.890 --> 00:05:45.010 align:middle line:84%
You learn how to actually
get people to the water fast.

00:05:45.010 --> 00:05:47.980 align:middle line:84%
If you push them three weeks
of preparation, it's too long.

00:05:47.980 --> 00:05:48.990 align:middle line:90%
They're overripe.

00:05:48.990 --> 00:05:51.310 align:middle line:84%
If it's one week,
it's too quick.

00:05:51.310 --> 00:05:53.110 align:middle line:84%
If you try 10 days,
that's too quick.

00:05:53.110 --> 00:05:54.830 align:middle line:84%
If you try 17 days,
it's too long.

00:05:54.830 --> 00:05:55.630 align:middle line:90%
It just worked out.

00:05:55.630 --> 00:05:58.630 align:middle line:84%
It's, like, two weeks is the
right timing for everything.

00:05:58.630 --> 00:05:59.590 align:middle line:90%
And then you're ready.

00:05:59.590 --> 00:06:01.673 align:middle line:84%
Then you're like, OK, I'm
ready, because gradually

00:06:01.673 --> 00:06:03.520 align:middle line:84%
the whole time
through the 14 days,

00:06:03.520 --> 00:06:04.935 align:middle line:84%
we're bringing
the calories down.

00:06:04.935 --> 00:06:06.310 align:middle line:84%
And we're bringing
the juices in.

00:06:06.310 --> 00:06:07.570 align:middle line:90%
We're going more liquids.

00:06:07.570 --> 00:06:09.140 align:middle line:84%
And then gradually, all of
a sudden, you're like, yep,

00:06:09.140 --> 00:06:09.790 align:middle line:90%
it's day 15.

00:06:09.790 --> 00:06:10.270 align:middle line:90%
I'm ready to go.

00:06:10.270 --> 00:06:11.290 align:middle line:84%
And you get up in
the morning, and you

00:06:11.290 --> 00:06:13.630 align:middle line:84%
get through that day, then
two days, then three days,

00:06:13.630 --> 00:06:14.140 align:middle line:90%
then four days.

00:06:14.140 --> 00:06:15.880 align:middle line:84%
Suddenly you're like, I'm
five days into a water

00:06:15.880 --> 00:06:17.290 align:middle line:90%
fast and doing my normal life.

00:06:17.290 --> 00:06:18.110 align:middle line:90%
What's going on?

00:06:18.110 --> 00:06:18.910 align:middle line:90%
You can do this.

00:06:18.910 --> 00:06:20.190 align:middle line:90%
These things can be done.

00:06:20.190 --> 00:06:23.830 align:middle line:84%
And you will feel better than
you've ever felt in your life.

00:06:23.830 --> 00:06:25.330 align:middle line:84%
I want to get into
this real quickly

00:06:25.330 --> 00:06:28.150 align:middle line:90%
because time is ticking away.

00:06:28.150 --> 00:06:29.140 align:middle line:90%
I love this right here.

00:06:29.140 --> 00:06:29.980 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:06:29.980 --> 00:06:31.270 align:middle line:90%
You know what I love about this?

00:06:31.270 --> 00:06:32.145 align:middle line:90%
I never wear a watch.

00:06:32.145 --> 00:06:33.880 align:middle line:90%
I've never worn a watch.

00:06:33.880 --> 00:06:35.710 align:middle line:90%
But we're running out of time.

00:06:35.710 --> 00:06:37.970 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:06:37.970 --> 00:06:39.140 align:middle line:90%
This is really interesting.

00:06:39.140 --> 00:06:42.140 align:middle line:84%
So all these years
into this field,

00:06:42.140 --> 00:06:45.820 align:middle line:84%
I was thinking, running all
these longevity conferences, 16

00:06:45.820 --> 00:06:48.760 align:middle line:84%
longevity conferences, I was
thinking, jeez I've got to you

00:06:48.760 --> 00:06:51.040 align:middle line:84%
know off the top of my head
the top longevity studies

00:06:51.040 --> 00:06:52.510 align:middle line:90%
ever done on animals ever.

00:06:52.510 --> 00:06:54.385 align:middle line:84%
I should know that right
off the top my head.

00:06:54.385 --> 00:06:56.428 align:middle line:90%
That's just-- I don't know that?

00:06:56.428 --> 00:06:57.970 align:middle line:84%
That was just a
little thought I had.

00:06:57.970 --> 00:07:00.410 align:middle line:84%
That was at the petrol
station in Calabasas

00:07:00.410 --> 00:07:01.410 align:middle line:90%
or somewhere over there.

00:07:01.410 --> 00:07:05.800 align:middle line:84%
It's like, what's the,
[? Cannon ?] [? Doom ?] Road,

00:07:05.800 --> 00:07:07.102 align:middle line:90%
that exit right there.

00:07:07.102 --> 00:07:08.060 align:middle line:90%
And I had that thought.

00:07:08.060 --> 00:07:11.170 align:middle line:84%
And I was like, OK, I'm going
to just get that in my head.

00:07:11.170 --> 00:07:12.610 align:middle line:84%
A couple weeks
later, I get a call

00:07:12.610 --> 00:07:15.160 align:middle line:84%
from my friend Lisa
Schisandra-maier.

00:07:15.160 --> 00:07:16.450 align:middle line:90%
We call her Schisandra-maier.

00:07:16.450 --> 00:07:17.380 align:middle line:90%
That's not her real name.

00:07:17.380 --> 00:07:19.505 align:middle line:84%
It's Scheffelmaier But we
call her Schisandra-maier

00:07:19.505 --> 00:07:21.310 align:middle line:90%
because she is really Shazam.

00:07:21.310 --> 00:07:23.170 align:middle line:84%
She's really got the
schisandra energy.

00:07:23.170 --> 00:07:25.420 align:middle line:84%
And the schisandra energy
is one of the great energies

00:07:25.420 --> 00:07:26.560 align:middle line:90%
of all herbs in the world.

00:07:26.560 --> 00:07:29.230 align:middle line:84%
It's the great super
fruit, the super berry

00:07:29.230 --> 00:07:32.080 align:middle line:84%
of Chinese medicine, considered
by many in Chinese medicine

00:07:32.080 --> 00:07:34.870 align:middle line:84%
to be the number-one
herb of all, schisandra.

00:07:34.870 --> 00:07:37.583 align:middle line:84%
And in my opinion, if
you had to survive,

00:07:37.583 --> 00:07:39.250 align:middle line:84%
you want to survive
on that because it's

00:07:39.250 --> 00:07:40.150 align:middle line:90%
got everything in it.

00:07:40.150 --> 00:07:41.230 align:middle line:84%
You just kind of nibble
on in, and you're

00:07:41.230 --> 00:07:42.340 align:middle line:90%
like, oh, it's kind of sweet.

00:07:42.340 --> 00:07:43.340 align:middle line:90%
Oh, it's kind of bitter.

00:07:43.340 --> 00:07:44.510 align:middle line:90%
Oh, it's kind juicy.

00:07:44.510 --> 00:07:45.800 align:middle line:90%
Oh, it's kind of good.

00:07:45.800 --> 00:07:47.800 align:middle line:90%
Oh, whoa, it's peppery.

00:07:47.800 --> 00:07:51.420 align:middle line:84%
It's got all this stuff going on
in just one little, tiny berry.

00:07:51.420 --> 00:07:53.420 align:middle line:84%
Schisandra-maier calls
me up, and she says, hey,

00:07:53.420 --> 00:07:56.020 align:middle line:84%
have you ever heard of
this stuff, the carbon 60

00:07:56.020 --> 00:07:59.300 align:middle line:90%
and all this C60, detox stuff?

00:07:59.300 --> 00:08:00.750 align:middle line:84%
And I was like,
never heard of it.

00:08:00.750 --> 00:08:02.500 align:middle line:84%
She's like-- but I
said, set me a website.

00:08:02.500 --> 00:08:03.458 align:middle line:90%
She sends me a website.

00:08:03.458 --> 00:08:06.280 align:middle line:84%
Boom, there comes up Fathi
Moussa's 2012 published study

00:08:06.280 --> 00:08:09.370 align:middle line:84%
on-- it's the greatest longevity
study ever done on animals

00:08:09.370 --> 00:08:13.920 align:middle line:84%
and doubling the lifespan
of rodents and accidentally.

00:08:13.920 --> 00:08:16.150 align:middle line:84%
There's a toxicology
study in 1996,

00:08:16.150 --> 00:08:17.740 align:middle line:84%
where Harry Kroto
won the Nobel Prize

00:08:17.740 --> 00:08:21.580 align:middle line:84%
for elucidating the carbon-60
molecule and many other related

00:08:21.580 --> 00:08:25.030 align:middle line:84%
molecules, which he classified
that whole group of carbon

00:08:25.030 --> 00:08:28.840 align:middle line:84%
atoms as an entirely
new allotrope.

00:08:28.840 --> 00:08:31.990 align:middle line:84%
What in the world's
an allotrope?

00:08:31.990 --> 00:08:34.210 align:middle line:84%
Like, a diamond is
different than charcoal.

00:08:34.210 --> 00:08:35.559 align:middle line:90%
But they're both carbon.

00:08:35.559 --> 00:08:37.902 align:middle line:90%
So they're different allotropes.

00:08:37.902 --> 00:08:39.610 align:middle line:84%
So for many years we
thought, OK, there's

00:08:39.610 --> 00:08:40.902 align:middle line:90%
only five allotropes of carbon.

00:08:40.902 --> 00:08:43.360 align:middle line:84%
But they're turned out to be
another whole grouping of them

00:08:43.360 --> 00:08:44.920 align:middle line:84%
called fullerenes,
which are-- you

00:08:44.920 --> 00:08:46.450 align:middle line:84%
know when you look
at charcoal, you

00:08:46.450 --> 00:08:47.890 align:middle line:90%
can see it's kind of in layers?

00:08:47.890 --> 00:08:49.153 align:middle line:90%
Anybody ever see that?

00:08:49.153 --> 00:08:50.320 align:middle line:90%
You can see it's the layers.

00:08:50.320 --> 00:08:53.230 align:middle line:84%
Like, OK, that's the layers
of the tree when it's growing.

00:08:53.230 --> 00:08:55.540 align:middle line:84%
Anybody know what I'm
talking about there?

00:08:55.540 --> 00:08:56.890 align:middle line:90%
Graphite's in layers.

00:08:56.890 --> 00:08:59.380 align:middle line:84%
Like your pencil, it's
got these layers in it.

00:08:59.380 --> 00:09:01.390 align:middle line:84%
Well, those, layers
can be bent and curved,

00:09:01.390 --> 00:09:02.890 align:middle line:90%
and those are called fullerenes.

00:09:02.890 --> 00:09:05.055 align:middle line:84%
And Kroto and Smalley
and their crew

00:09:05.055 --> 00:09:07.180 align:middle line:84%
won the Nobel Prize for
elucidating those molecules

00:09:07.180 --> 00:09:09.940 align:middle line:84%
in 1996, which opened
the doorway for science

00:09:09.940 --> 00:09:11.500 align:middle line:90%
to investigate.

00:09:11.500 --> 00:09:14.740 align:middle line:84%
And that led to very
interesting research, eventually

00:09:14.740 --> 00:09:16.690 align:middle line:84%
culminating in our field,
in the health field,

00:09:16.690 --> 00:09:18.732 align:middle line:84%
in the research done by
Fathi Moussa and his crew

00:09:18.732 --> 00:09:20.013 align:middle line:90%
in Paris on rodents.

00:09:20.013 --> 00:09:21.930 align:middle line:84%
And they were basically
trying to kill rodents

00:09:21.930 --> 00:09:25.552 align:middle line:84%
with this stuff to see how
much-- like what's the LD 50?

00:09:25.552 --> 00:09:26.760 align:middle line:90%
I'm not into animal research.

00:09:26.760 --> 00:09:29.190 align:middle line:84%
It's just a total abomination
what they do to animals.

00:09:29.190 --> 00:09:31.830 align:middle line:84%
But, jeez, the LD 50
is how much do you

00:09:31.830 --> 00:09:33.990 align:middle line:84%
have to give to these
things, these little animals,

00:09:33.990 --> 00:09:35.072 align:middle line:90%
to kill 50% of them?

00:09:35.072 --> 00:09:36.030 align:middle line:90%
That's what that means.

00:09:36.030 --> 00:09:37.400 align:middle line:90%
It's the lethal dose 50.

00:09:37.400 --> 00:09:38.525 align:middle line:90%
Anybody ever heard of that?

00:09:38.525 --> 00:09:40.710 align:middle line:90%
It's horrible what they do.

00:09:40.710 --> 00:09:43.200 align:middle line:84%
But anyway, they actually ended
up doubling their lifespan

00:09:43.200 --> 00:09:44.200 align:middle line:90%
in this particular case.

00:09:44.200 --> 00:09:47.070 align:middle line:84%
And of course, because
this is science,

00:09:47.070 --> 00:09:49.730 align:middle line:84%
and science has no ethics,
integrity or morality

00:09:49.730 --> 00:09:52.650 align:middle line:84%
in many cases, unfortunately,
they actually--

00:09:52.650 --> 00:09:55.750 align:middle line:84%
the last rat in that
study kept living on.

00:09:55.750 --> 00:09:57.750 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:09:57.750 --> 00:09:59.802 align:middle line:84%
And so finally, all they
get together and like,

00:09:59.802 --> 00:10:02.010 align:middle line:84%
we should just kill this
thing and publish this study

00:10:02.010 --> 00:10:04.650 align:middle line:84%
because we've got to
get this thing out,

00:10:04.650 --> 00:10:06.150 align:middle line:90%
which is what they did.

00:10:06.150 --> 00:10:07.535 align:middle line:90%
So that rat could have lived on.

00:10:07.535 --> 00:10:09.660 align:middle line:84%
And who knows what the
actual results of that study

00:10:09.660 --> 00:10:10.460 align:middle line:90%
could have been?

00:10:10.460 --> 00:10:12.630 align:middle line:84%
It could have been more
than doubling their lifespan

00:10:12.630 --> 00:10:14.970 align:middle line:84%
if that particular animal
would have lived on.

00:10:14.970 --> 00:10:16.170 align:middle line:90%
So this is very interesting.

00:10:16.170 --> 00:10:17.878 align:middle line:84%
So they accidentally
doubled the lifespan

00:10:17.878 --> 00:10:21.060 align:middle line:84%
of these animals using
a form of carbon.

00:10:21.060 --> 00:10:23.970 align:middle line:84%
And this blends to a very
important theory of aging

00:10:23.970 --> 00:10:28.800 align:middle line:84%
and a very important discovery,
which is detoxification

00:10:28.800 --> 00:10:34.620 align:middle line:84%
is more important than
nutrition for longevity.

00:10:34.620 --> 00:10:37.920 align:middle line:84%
You can survive long periods
of time on malnutrition.

00:10:37.920 --> 00:10:40.050 align:middle line:84%
But if you can't
detoxify, right-- that's

00:10:40.050 --> 00:10:42.220 align:middle line:84%
basically what happens when
people starve to death.

00:10:42.220 --> 00:10:43.270 align:middle line:90%
They are not detoxifying.

00:10:43.270 --> 00:10:44.520 align:middle line:90%
They can't get the toxins out.

00:10:44.520 --> 00:10:46.208 align:middle line:84%
They bathe in their
own waste and die.

00:10:46.208 --> 00:10:48.500 align:middle line:84%
But if you can keep flushing
those toxins out, flushing

00:10:48.500 --> 00:10:50.333 align:middle line:84%
these toxins out,
flushing those toxins out,

00:10:50.333 --> 00:10:51.863 align:middle line:90%
you can actually live on.

00:10:51.863 --> 00:10:54.030 align:middle line:84%
And this is one of the great
discoveries of our age.

00:10:54.030 --> 00:10:55.320 align:middle line:84%
It's one of the great
discoveries of all

00:10:55.320 --> 00:10:56.850 align:middle line:90%
the great fasting literature.

00:10:56.850 --> 00:10:58.530 align:middle line:84%
It's one of the great
discoveries of all the raw food

00:10:58.530 --> 00:10:59.330 align:middle line:90%
literature.

00:10:59.330 --> 00:11:01.915 align:middle line:84%
It's one of the great
discoveries of longevity ever,

00:11:01.915 --> 00:11:04.290 align:middle line:84%
which is, jeez, you can't--
it's very difficult to starve

00:11:04.290 --> 00:11:06.720 align:middle line:84%
to death, but it is possible
that you bathe in your own

00:11:06.720 --> 00:11:07.530 align:middle line:90%
waste and die.

00:11:07.530 --> 00:11:09.068 align:middle line:90%
That is definitely possible.

00:11:09.068 --> 00:11:11.110 align:middle line:84%
And so if you keep flushing,
cleansing, flushing,

00:11:11.110 --> 00:11:12.260 align:middle line:90%
and cleansing--

00:11:12.260 --> 00:11:14.760 align:middle line:84%
I had a guy living with me
for a while who didn't eat--

00:11:14.760 --> 00:11:17.080 align:middle line:84%
he didn't eat food
for seven years.

00:11:17.080 --> 00:11:17.880 align:middle line:90%
Mm-hmm.

00:11:17.880 --> 00:11:20.473 align:middle line:84%
And that-- of
course, we're bald--

00:11:20.473 --> 00:11:22.140 align:middle line:84%
we're bought into--
our default religion

00:11:22.140 --> 00:11:23.850 align:middle line:90%
and our reality is scientism.

00:11:23.850 --> 00:11:25.530 align:middle line:90%
We've defaulted right into it.

00:11:25.530 --> 00:11:28.245 align:middle line:84%
You have a religion, whether
you believe it or not, right?

00:11:28.245 --> 00:11:29.620 align:middle line:84%
Whatever you
believe's above you,

00:11:29.620 --> 00:11:30.790 align:middle line:84%
below you is part
of your religion.

00:11:30.790 --> 00:11:32.980 align:middle line:84%
Whatever you think happens
before you born, after you die,

00:11:32.980 --> 00:11:34.890 align:middle line:84%
it's part of your religion,
whether you believe what--

00:11:34.890 --> 00:11:36.120 align:middle line:84%
maybe you think you're--
maybe you're an atheist.

00:11:36.120 --> 00:11:38.247 align:middle line:84%
Whatever it is, but
that's your religion.

00:11:38.247 --> 00:11:40.080 align:middle line:84%
And our default religion
of our civilization

00:11:40.080 --> 00:11:42.437 align:middle line:90%
is scientism, right?

00:11:42.437 --> 00:11:44.520 align:middle line:84%
And that's scientism is
like, science, and science

00:11:44.520 --> 00:11:45.320 align:middle line:90%
knows every answer.

00:11:45.320 --> 00:11:49.200 align:middle line:84%
And science can figure
everything out until it can't--

00:11:49.200 --> 00:11:52.560 align:middle line:84%
until it can't-- or until
materialism starts to disturb

00:11:52.560 --> 00:11:55.110 align:middle line:84%
the scientific method,
which is a big problem

00:11:55.110 --> 00:11:56.730 align:middle line:90%
in our civilization, right?

00:11:56.730 --> 00:11:57.870 align:middle line:90%
That's a very huge problem.

00:11:57.870 --> 00:11:59.100 align:middle line:84%
Rupert Sheldrake
wrote a great book

00:11:59.100 --> 00:12:00.558 align:middle line:84%
about this, "The
Science Delusion,"

00:12:00.558 --> 00:12:03.780 align:middle line:84%
wonderful book, if you know
his work, famous scientist.

00:12:03.780 --> 00:12:06.990 align:middle line:84%
He finally got sick of the
materialism infiltrating

00:12:06.990 --> 00:12:10.007 align:middle line:84%
into the science, turning
it into scientism, which

00:12:10.007 --> 00:12:11.715 align:middle line:84%
means like, oh, somebody
has to eat food,

00:12:11.715 --> 00:12:13.073 align:middle line:90%
or they're going to die.

00:12:13.073 --> 00:12:14.490 align:middle line:84%
Well, it's like,
well, let's test.

00:12:14.490 --> 00:12:16.067 align:middle line:84%
We need to do
scientific research.

00:12:16.067 --> 00:12:18.150 align:middle line:84%
And it's interesting about
the scientific research

00:12:18.150 --> 00:12:18.990 align:middle line:90%
on people like this.

00:12:18.990 --> 00:12:22.410 align:middle line:84%
And to me, it's more interesting
to be around a person like this

00:12:22.410 --> 00:12:24.882 align:middle line:90%
because you can feel it.

00:12:24.882 --> 00:12:26.590 align:middle line:84%
If he's like, we're
getting up at 5:00 AM

00:12:26.590 --> 00:12:28.547 align:middle line:84%
and we're working
out, it's 4:59.

00:12:28.547 --> 00:12:30.630 align:middle line:84%
I'm praying that I'm going
to be able to sleep in.

00:12:30.630 --> 00:12:32.950 align:middle line:84%
And at 5:00 AM, he's on
that door, bang, bang,

00:12:32.950 --> 00:12:35.490 align:middle line:84%
bang, because he's the most
sober person you've ever

00:12:35.490 --> 00:12:37.658 align:middle line:90%
met ever in your life.

00:12:37.658 --> 00:12:39.450 align:middle line:84%
You never met anybody
more sober than that.

00:12:39.450 --> 00:12:41.080 align:middle line:90%
And he hasn't eaten for years.

00:12:41.080 --> 00:12:43.830 align:middle line:84%
So he's every moment
totally on it, with it.

00:12:43.830 --> 00:12:45.770 align:middle line:84%
Energy's transducing
through his body.

00:12:45.770 --> 00:12:47.520 align:middle line:84%
You've never been
around anything like it.

00:12:47.520 --> 00:12:50.103 align:middle line:84%
It's difficult to be around it
because you're like, whoa, this

00:12:50.103 --> 00:12:50.903 align:middle line:90%
dude.

00:12:50.903 --> 00:12:53.328 align:middle line:84%
What's coming off of this
guy is out of control.

00:12:53.328 --> 00:12:55.620 align:middle line:84%
And he taught me very clearly
that all you've got to do

00:12:55.620 --> 00:12:57.390 align:middle line:84%
is keep flushing and cleansing,
flushing and cleansing,

00:12:57.390 --> 00:12:58.348 align:middle line:90%
flushing and cleansing.

00:12:58.348 --> 00:13:00.420 align:middle line:84%
Don't let the waste
build up on you.

00:13:00.420 --> 00:13:05.700 align:middle line:84%
And that key teaching is water
and sea salt, water and sea

00:13:05.700 --> 00:13:07.710 align:middle line:84%
salt, water and sea
salt to flush you out.

00:13:07.710 --> 00:13:10.230 align:middle line:90%
You're mostly an ocean inside.

00:13:10.230 --> 00:13:13.780 align:middle line:84%
If you drink too much water,
you're going to get dehydrated.

00:13:13.780 --> 00:13:16.210 align:middle line:84%
If you drink too much salt
water, you get dehydrated.

00:13:16.210 --> 00:13:20.185 align:middle line:84%
So there's a nice balance
between water and salt.

00:13:20.185 --> 00:13:21.810 align:middle line:84%
And it's got to be
sea salt, obviously,

00:13:21.810 --> 00:13:23.602 align:middle line:84%
or it's going to be
some kind of rock salt,

00:13:23.602 --> 00:13:25.470 align:middle line:84%
Himalayan salt, or some
salt that's natural.

00:13:25.470 --> 00:13:27.150 align:middle line:84%
These kiln-dried
salts and salts that

00:13:27.150 --> 00:13:29.025 align:middle line:84%
are coming from more
Morton's iodized factory

00:13:29.025 --> 00:13:31.662 align:middle line:84%
outside of Chicago
are not the best ever.

00:13:31.662 --> 00:13:33.870 align:middle line:84%
I've been talking about that
place outside of Chicago

00:13:33.870 --> 00:13:34.860 align:middle line:90%
for many years.

00:13:34.860 --> 00:13:37.318 align:middle line:84%
All of a sudden, I got a
message on Facebook one day,

00:13:37.318 --> 00:13:38.610 align:middle line:90%
and they had an accident there.

00:13:38.610 --> 00:13:41.205 align:middle line:84%
And the salt came out the
door and busted the door down

00:13:41.205 --> 00:13:43.080 align:middle line:84%
and covered over the
cars in the parking lot.

00:13:43.080 --> 00:13:44.658 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:13:44.658 --> 00:13:46.200 align:middle line:84%
And I was like, oh,
that's the place!

00:13:46.200 --> 00:13:47.325 align:middle line:90%
Because you're driving on--

00:13:47.325 --> 00:13:48.673 align:middle line:90%
I think it's the 95 in Chicago.

00:13:48.673 --> 00:13:49.840 align:middle line:90%
And you look out the window.

00:13:49.840 --> 00:13:51.270 align:middle line:90%
And it's, like, raining.

00:13:51.270 --> 00:13:53.370 align:middle line:84%
And there's all those
brake dust and soot

00:13:53.370 --> 00:13:54.710 align:middle line:90%
coming off the freeway.

00:13:54.710 --> 00:13:59.580 align:middle line:84%
And there's the big bay doors
of Morton's iodized salt open.

00:13:59.580 --> 00:14:01.920 align:middle line:84%
And there's all that
salt right there.

00:14:01.920 --> 00:14:03.520 align:middle line:84%
And all that stuff
from the freeway

00:14:03.520 --> 00:14:06.360 align:middle line:84%
just going shwoo-ergh
right to the salt.

00:14:06.360 --> 00:14:07.830 align:middle line:90%
>> When it rains, it pours.

00:14:07.830 --> 00:14:10.590 align:middle line:90%
>> When it rains, it pours.

00:14:10.590 --> 00:14:13.770 align:middle line:84%
And then next door to it is
that Sherman Williams paint

00:14:13.770 --> 00:14:16.140 align:middle line:84%
plant that has bucket
of paint, and it says,

00:14:16.140 --> 00:14:17.400 align:middle line:90%
"we will paint the earth."

00:14:17.400 --> 00:14:19.000 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:14:19.000 --> 00:14:19.800 align:middle line:90%


00:14:19.800 --> 00:14:22.530 align:middle line:90%
That's just next door.

00:14:22.530 --> 00:14:24.220 align:middle line:84%
Salt attracts these
types of things.

00:14:24.220 --> 00:14:26.833 align:middle line:84%
So I'm a big advocate
of natural salts.

00:14:26.833 --> 00:14:27.750 align:middle line:90%
And he taught me that.

00:14:27.750 --> 00:14:29.370 align:middle line:84%
He taught me just keep
flushing and cleansing.

00:14:29.370 --> 00:14:31.455 align:middle line:84%
Sure enough, about a year
later, I was in Bali.

00:14:31.455 --> 00:14:34.530 align:middle line:84%
I got, whatever,
amoebas, parasites.

00:14:34.530 --> 00:14:36.300 align:middle line:84%
You know those guys
are the worst ever.

00:14:36.300 --> 00:14:37.745 align:middle line:90%
And I could not eat or drink.

00:14:37.745 --> 00:14:40.120 align:middle line:84%
And I thought, jeez, well, I
can't eat or drink anything.

00:14:40.120 --> 00:14:43.680 align:middle line:84%
But I feel fine as long
as I don't do anything.

00:14:43.680 --> 00:14:45.180 align:middle line:84%
This is a very
important lesson, one

00:14:45.180 --> 00:14:47.190 align:middle line:90%
of the key teachings for today.

00:14:47.190 --> 00:14:50.190 align:middle line:90%
Nothing is better for pain.

00:14:50.190 --> 00:14:51.910 align:middle line:84%
When you're in pain,
don't do anything.

00:14:51.910 --> 00:14:52.980 align:middle line:90%
Don't reach for anything.

00:14:52.980 --> 00:14:53.970 align:middle line:90%
Don't eat anything.

00:14:53.970 --> 00:14:56.340 align:middle line:90%
Don't do anything.

00:14:56.340 --> 00:14:58.990 align:middle line:90%
Nothing is better for pain.

00:14:58.990 --> 00:14:59.790 align:middle line:90%
Just lay there.

00:14:59.790 --> 00:15:02.640 align:middle line:90%


00:15:02.640 --> 00:15:04.930 align:middle line:84%
Our whole civilization,
that's the scientism.

00:15:04.930 --> 00:15:05.730 align:middle line:90%
I'm in pain!

00:15:05.730 --> 00:15:08.100 align:middle line:90%
I have to do something!

00:15:08.100 --> 00:15:09.210 align:middle line:90%
Don't do anything.

00:15:09.210 --> 00:15:12.842 align:middle line:84%
Nothing-- nothing
is better for pain.

00:15:12.842 --> 00:15:13.800 align:middle line:90%
What's better for pain?

00:15:13.800 --> 00:15:15.917 align:middle line:90%
>> Nothing.

00:15:15.917 --> 00:15:17.000 align:middle line:90%
>> What do you have to do?

00:15:17.000 --> 00:15:18.860 align:middle line:90%
>> Nothing.

00:15:18.860 --> 00:15:21.110 align:middle line:90%
>> Just lay there.

00:15:21.110 --> 00:15:23.527 align:middle line:84%
So I was like, wait a second,
I don't have to do anything.

00:15:23.527 --> 00:15:25.985 align:middle line:84%
This is what I learned from
hanging out with a breatharian,

00:15:25.985 --> 00:15:26.943 align:middle line:90%
just don't do anything.

00:15:26.943 --> 00:15:27.743 align:middle line:90%
I won't eat.

00:15:27.743 --> 00:15:28.680 align:middle line:90%
I don't need to drink.

00:15:28.680 --> 00:15:29.972 align:middle line:90%
That dude doesn't eat or drink.

00:15:29.972 --> 00:15:30.887 align:middle line:90%
I can do it.

00:15:30.887 --> 00:15:32.720 align:middle line:84%
Until this thing goes,
I'll just keep going.

00:15:32.720 --> 00:15:34.580 align:middle line:84%
So I run-- I'm
running this retreat

00:15:34.580 --> 00:15:36.110 align:middle line:90%
while not eating or drinking.

00:15:36.110 --> 00:15:37.880 align:middle line:84%
That was rough,
especially hiking up

00:15:37.880 --> 00:15:39.030 align:middle line:90%
that mountain, Mount Agung.

00:15:39.030 --> 00:15:39.830 align:middle line:90%
What is this?

00:15:39.830 --> 00:15:42.230 align:middle line:84%
Is that the one, where you
get up at 3:00 in the morning.

00:15:42.230 --> 00:15:43.938 align:middle line:84%
You go up that mountain
to the top, where

00:15:43.938 --> 00:15:45.200 align:middle line:90%
the monkeys are and stuff.

00:15:45.200 --> 00:15:46.250 align:middle line:90%
And that was a rough one.

00:15:46.250 --> 00:15:47.050 align:middle line:90%
Oh, jeez.

00:15:47.050 --> 00:15:48.630 align:middle line:84%
But after that I
settled into it.

00:15:48.630 --> 00:15:50.840 align:middle line:84%
And I was like, OK,
just keep breathing.

00:15:50.840 --> 00:15:53.810 align:middle line:84%
We got stuck in a traffic jam
for seven hours on a Hindu

00:15:53.810 --> 00:15:55.070 align:middle line:90%
holiday.

00:15:55.070 --> 00:15:57.320 align:middle line:84%
And we were watching
videos, Ricky Gervais

00:15:57.320 --> 00:15:59.552 align:middle line:90%
and Karl Pilkington.

00:15:59.552 --> 00:16:01.010 align:middle line:84%
Do you know what
I'm talking about?

00:16:01.010 --> 00:16:02.780 align:middle line:90%
"The Monkey News."

00:16:02.780 --> 00:16:04.600 align:middle line:90%
Oh, my god, was that good.

00:16:04.600 --> 00:16:06.920 align:middle line:84%
Well, we-- I didn't
want to leave the bus.

00:16:06.920 --> 00:16:09.170 align:middle line:84%
We were laughing so hard
in the back of the bus.

00:16:09.170 --> 00:16:10.670 align:middle line:84%
Because when you're
not eating or drinking

00:16:10.670 --> 00:16:12.350 align:middle line:84%
after days and days and
days, eventually you're

00:16:12.350 --> 00:16:13.150 align:middle line:90%
in a state of--

00:16:13.150 --> 00:16:15.032 align:middle line:84%
you're in a perfect
state of balance.

00:16:15.032 --> 00:16:16.490 align:middle line:84%
You're in a perfect
state of peace.

00:16:16.490 --> 00:16:18.020 align:middle line:84%
And then when you're
watching comedies like that,

00:16:18.020 --> 00:16:19.150 align:middle line:84%
you can't believe
how funny it is.

00:16:19.150 --> 00:16:21.210 align:middle line:84%
It's like the best thing
you've ever seen ever.

00:16:21.210 --> 00:16:23.990 align:middle line:84%
And so I was I in a state
of Samadhi in like traffic

00:16:23.990 --> 00:16:27.020 align:middle line:84%
jam on some Hindu holiday
in some random road on Bali

00:16:27.020 --> 00:16:29.250 align:middle line:84%
for hours, watching
"The Monkey News."

00:16:29.250 --> 00:16:30.260 align:middle line:90%
I really recommend that.

00:16:30.260 --> 00:16:31.250 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:16:31.250 --> 00:16:35.420 align:middle line:84%
Anyway, so this eventually led
me through all this research

00:16:35.420 --> 00:16:40.208 align:middle line:84%
on what happened with Fathi
Mousse's study, the water

00:16:40.208 --> 00:16:41.750 align:middle line:84%
and salt combination,
making sure you

00:16:41.750 --> 00:16:44.510 align:middle line:84%
get the right ratio of that
so you're not dehydrated.

00:16:44.510 --> 00:16:45.740 align:middle line:90%
You're actually hydrated.

00:16:45.740 --> 00:16:47.900 align:middle line:84%
If you drink just water
again you'll get dehydrate.

00:16:47.900 --> 00:16:48.590 align:middle line:90%
Everyone's done it, right?

00:16:48.590 --> 00:16:49.590 align:middle line:90%
You drank water all day.

00:16:49.590 --> 00:16:52.760 align:middle line:84%
You did the eight ounces,
eight times a day.

00:16:52.760 --> 00:16:53.970 align:middle line:90%
And what happened?

00:16:53.970 --> 00:16:55.370 align:middle line:90%
You're peeing every 20 minutes.

00:16:55.370 --> 00:16:56.170 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:16:56.170 --> 00:16:58.100 align:middle line:84%
>> You're like, wait,
I'll be right back.

00:16:58.100 --> 00:16:59.030 align:middle line:84%
And then next thing
you know you're

00:16:59.030 --> 00:16:59.840 align:middle line:90%
like, jeez, what the heck?

00:16:59.840 --> 00:17:01.580 align:middle line:84%
And then you're dehydrated
at the end of the day.

00:17:01.580 --> 00:17:04.369 align:middle line:84%
And then you realize at some
point the electrolytes mean sea

00:17:04.369 --> 00:17:07.990 align:middle line:84%
salt. All these things that
are sold as electrolytes,

00:17:07.990 --> 00:17:09.635 align:middle line:90%
they're designer sea salts.

00:17:09.635 --> 00:17:11.640 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:17:11.640 --> 00:17:12.874 align:middle line:90%
That's what they are.

00:17:12.874 --> 00:17:13.674 align:middle line:90%
>> Or [INAUDIBLE]

00:17:13.674 --> 00:17:14.474 align:middle line:90%
>> Right?

00:17:14.474 --> 00:17:15.930 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, or designer
Himalayan salt.

00:17:15.930 --> 00:17:17.440 align:middle line:84%
They add a little thing in here,
put a little thing in there,

00:17:17.440 --> 00:17:18.398 align:middle line:90%
and put a little there.

00:17:18.398 --> 00:17:21.050 align:middle line:84%
It's a designer salt. It's just
salt. Electrolytes are just

00:17:21.050 --> 00:17:23.430 align:middle line:90%
salt. We're water and salt.

00:17:23.430 --> 00:17:25.369 align:middle line:84%
And then we're a
carbon-based life form.

00:17:25.369 --> 00:17:28.010 align:middle line:84%
So I started putting together
the pieces of hey, water, sea

00:17:28.010 --> 00:17:30.950 align:middle line:84%
salt, and charcoal
in the morning.

00:17:30.950 --> 00:17:32.060 align:middle line:90%
Because one day it hit me.

00:17:32.060 --> 00:17:33.975 align:middle line:84%
I started doing the
carbon 60 every day.

00:17:33.975 --> 00:17:36.600 align:middle line:84%
And I started going, whoa, wait
a second, what's going on here?

00:17:36.600 --> 00:17:37.517 align:middle line:90%
What's happening here?

00:17:37.517 --> 00:17:39.410 align:middle line:84%
And I start getting
really strong cravings

00:17:39.410 --> 00:17:41.480 align:middle line:90%
for activated charcoal.

00:17:41.480 --> 00:17:43.280 align:middle line:84%
And then the thought
hit me, this thought.

00:17:43.280 --> 00:17:45.230 align:middle line:90%
Here's the thought.

00:17:45.230 --> 00:17:51.555 align:middle line:10%
I never had looked up activated
charcoal and longevity

00:17:51.555 --> 00:17:53.430 align:middle line:10%
because I'm thinking,
wait, carbon 60, that's

00:17:53.430 --> 00:17:55.890 align:middle line:10%
a fraction of activated
charcoal that they're

00:17:55.890 --> 00:17:57.570 align:middle line:10%
feeding to these
rats, and they're

00:17:57.570 --> 00:17:58.920 align:middle line:10%
doubling their lifespan.

00:17:58.920 --> 00:18:00.870 align:middle line:84%
What about just activated
charcoal by itself?

00:18:00.870 --> 00:18:01.890 align:middle line:90%
And that was a big deal.

00:18:01.890 --> 00:18:04.260 align:middle line:90%
That was a huge breakthrough.

00:18:04.260 --> 00:18:07.800 align:middle line:84%
And then I came across
the work of Frolkis

00:18:07.800 --> 00:18:10.090 align:middle line:84%
the Russian gerontologist,
who had been increasing

00:18:10.090 --> 00:18:14.310 align:middle line:84%
the lifespan of mice
consistently by 20% to 47%

00:18:14.310 --> 00:18:17.010 align:middle line:90%
with activated charcoal--

00:18:17.010 --> 00:18:19.920 align:middle line:84%
20% to 47% increase of
lifespan consistently

00:18:19.920 --> 00:18:21.180 align:middle line:90%
over 70 years of research.

00:18:21.180 --> 00:18:23.520 align:middle line:84%
And the science is unparalleled,
and it's unmatched.

00:18:23.520 --> 00:18:25.020 align:middle line:84%
There's nothing-- you
will never find anything.

00:18:25.020 --> 00:18:25.880 align:middle line:90%
There's no nutrient.

00:18:25.880 --> 00:18:26.797 align:middle line:90%
There's no ingredient.

00:18:26.797 --> 00:18:28.160 align:middle line:90%
There's nothing you could eat.

00:18:28.160 --> 00:18:30.270 align:middle line:84%
There's no super
nutraceutical you

00:18:30.270 --> 00:18:33.870 align:middle line:84%
could have that's going to give
you that odds of increasing

00:18:33.870 --> 00:18:34.860 align:middle line:90%
your lifespan.

00:18:34.860 --> 00:18:38.040 align:middle line:84%
Activated charcoal, in terms
of odds and stacking the odds

00:18:38.040 --> 00:18:39.977 align:middle line:90%
in your favor, is number one.

00:18:39.977 --> 00:18:41.310 align:middle line:90%
Now you're going, wait a second.

00:18:41.310 --> 00:18:42.110 align:middle line:90%
OK, hold on.

00:18:42.110 --> 00:18:43.290 align:middle line:90%
What, every day?

00:18:43.290 --> 00:18:46.590 align:middle line:84%
Yep, every day or as much as you
can, maybe five times a week,

00:18:46.590 --> 00:18:51.330 align:middle line:84%
in the morning with water,
first thing in the morning.

00:18:51.330 --> 00:18:54.600 align:middle line:84%
And then here's where it
gets really interesting.

00:18:54.600 --> 00:18:59.010 align:middle line:84%
Doesn't charcoal absorb
healthy nutrients, right?

00:18:59.010 --> 00:19:01.890 align:middle line:90%
Is it an adsorber?

00:19:01.890 --> 00:19:04.380 align:middle line:90%
And the answer is, it is not.

00:19:04.380 --> 00:19:06.570 align:middle line:90%
It does not absorb anything.

00:19:06.570 --> 00:19:07.800 align:middle line:90%
It's not absorbent.

00:19:07.800 --> 00:19:10.310 align:middle line:90%
It's not a sponge.

00:19:10.310 --> 00:19:11.110 align:middle line:90%
Wait, what?

00:19:11.110 --> 00:19:13.640 align:middle line:90%


00:19:13.640 --> 00:19:15.920 align:middle line:90%
We believe charcoal is a sponge.

00:19:15.920 --> 00:19:17.810 align:middle line:84%
That's kind of how we
were taught about it.

00:19:17.810 --> 00:19:20.435 align:middle line:84%
It's-- activated charcoal, when
you blast the superheated steam

00:19:20.435 --> 00:19:23.310 align:middle line:84%
through the charcoal, that's
how you get it activated.

00:19:23.310 --> 00:19:25.220 align:middle line:10%
And you clean it up,
get those last 10%

00:19:25.220 --> 00:19:27.197 align:middle line:10%
of the volatile
compounds off, burn off

00:19:27.197 --> 00:19:29.030 align:middle line:10%
that last bit of protein
that might be left,

00:19:29.030 --> 00:19:31.340 align:middle line:10%
last bit of sulfur,
maybe some minerals,

00:19:31.340 --> 00:19:33.620 align:middle line:10%
and just try to get back to
the total carbon skeleton.

00:19:33.620 --> 00:19:37.360 align:middle line:84%
It makes it more porous,
makes it more like a sponge.

00:19:37.360 --> 00:19:39.500 align:middle line:84%
But it's not a sponge,
never has been a sponge.

00:19:39.500 --> 00:19:41.360 align:middle line:90%
It isn't a sponge.

00:19:41.360 --> 00:19:43.490 align:middle line:90%
It's adsorbtive.

00:19:43.490 --> 00:19:46.400 align:middle line:84%
And that's a very
interesting difference,

00:19:46.400 --> 00:19:49.850 align:middle line:90%
adsorbtive versus absortive.

00:19:49.850 --> 00:19:53.330 align:middle line:90%
Adsorbtive is like a magnet.

00:19:53.330 --> 00:19:56.660 align:middle line:90%


00:19:56.660 --> 00:19:58.760 align:middle line:90%
It's electromagnetic.

00:19:58.760 --> 00:20:01.080 align:middle line:90%
Charcoal's electromagnetic.

00:20:01.080 --> 00:20:01.880 align:middle line:90%
Here's one for you.

00:20:01.880 --> 00:20:02.330 align:middle line:90%
Ready for this?

00:20:02.330 --> 00:20:03.497 align:middle line:90%
Who invented the light bulb?

00:20:03.497 --> 00:20:04.297 align:middle line:90%
Watch this one.

00:20:04.297 --> 00:20:05.100 align:middle line:90%
You ready for this?

00:20:05.100 --> 00:20:06.330 align:middle line:90%
You're not ready.

00:20:06.330 --> 00:20:08.540 align:middle line:90%
You're ready.

00:20:08.540 --> 00:20:10.230 align:middle line:90%
Who invented the light bulb?

00:20:10.230 --> 00:20:11.030 align:middle line:90%
>> Thomas Edison.

00:20:11.030 --> 00:20:11.960 align:middle line:90%
>> Great answer.

00:20:11.960 --> 00:20:12.920 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:20:12.920 --> 00:20:13.880 align:middle line:90%
Wrong answer.

00:20:13.880 --> 00:20:15.060 align:middle line:90%
But great guess.

00:20:15.060 --> 00:20:15.860 align:middle line:10%
>> [INAUDIBLE]

00:20:15.860 --> 00:20:17.410 align:middle line:90%
>> No.

00:20:17.410 --> 00:20:19.220 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, probably way
back when, right?

00:20:19.220 --> 00:20:21.530 align:middle line:84%
The actual light bulb
that we have currently

00:20:21.530 --> 00:20:25.730 align:middle line:84%
today was-- the patent for
that was developed in the 1850s

00:20:25.730 --> 00:20:29.420 align:middle line:84%
and was bought by Thomas
Edison, and he perfected it.

00:20:29.420 --> 00:20:31.203 align:middle line:90%
The original filament for--

00:20:31.203 --> 00:20:32.870 align:middle line:84%
this is going to
change your whole life.

00:20:32.870 --> 00:20:35.840 align:middle line:84%
This will change every
fire you ever look at.

00:20:35.840 --> 00:20:38.060 align:middle line:84%
From this point on, every
camp fire you ever have

00:20:38.060 --> 00:20:39.560 align:middle line:84%
or every fire you
make in your house

00:20:39.560 --> 00:20:41.510 align:middle line:84%
you're going to look
at it differently.

00:20:41.510 --> 00:20:45.158 align:middle line:84%
The original filament
was charcoal.

00:20:45.158 --> 00:20:46.700 align:middle line:84%
When those coals
are burning, there's

00:20:46.700 --> 00:20:51.680 align:middle line:84%
an electrical
phenomenon going on.

00:20:51.680 --> 00:20:54.530 align:middle line:84%
All this, all the light and
everything you see around us

00:20:54.530 --> 00:20:56.030 align:middle line:84%
was figured out
because of charcoal.

00:20:56.030 --> 00:20:57.672 align:middle line:84%
Charcoal's at the
core of gunpowder.

00:20:57.672 --> 00:20:59.630 align:middle line:84%
Charcoal's at the core
of almost-- you name it.

00:20:59.630 --> 00:21:02.750 align:middle line:84%
Every filtration mechanism,
charcoal's at the core of it.

00:21:02.750 --> 00:21:06.530 align:middle line:84%
Resetting the earth,
resetting your garden,

00:21:06.530 --> 00:21:09.050 align:middle line:84%
getting everything renewed,
charcoal's at the core of it

00:21:09.050 --> 00:21:10.190 align:middle line:90%
and at the bottom of it.

00:21:10.190 --> 00:21:13.580 align:middle line:84%
Resetting your microbiome,
charcoal's at the core of it

00:21:13.580 --> 00:21:14.780 align:middle line:90%
all.

00:21:14.780 --> 00:21:16.280 align:middle line:84%
You want to reset
your microbiome?

00:21:16.280 --> 00:21:17.210 align:middle line:90%
It's charcoal.

00:21:17.210 --> 00:21:18.010 align:middle line:90%
Do you need a lot?

00:21:18.010 --> 00:21:21.270 align:middle line:84%
No, start small, maybe 1
capsule, 400-milligram capsule.

00:21:21.270 --> 00:21:22.070 align:middle line:90%
That's it.

00:21:22.070 --> 00:21:23.300 align:middle line:90%
Start with that.

00:21:23.300 --> 00:21:25.430 align:middle line:84%
And you just
gradually step by step

00:21:25.430 --> 00:21:27.290 align:middle line:84%
by step go, what's
going on with this?

00:21:27.290 --> 00:21:30.800 align:middle line:84%
Because I found out,
interestingly and through lots

00:21:30.800 --> 00:21:34.580 align:middle line:84%
of trial-and-success method,
that if I wanted to stay up

00:21:34.580 --> 00:21:36.920 align:middle line:84%
all night, I could, no
problem, as long as I

00:21:36.920 --> 00:21:39.140 align:middle line:90%
took enough charcoal.

00:21:39.140 --> 00:21:40.290 align:middle line:90%
Why?

00:21:40.290 --> 00:21:44.220 align:middle line:84%
Because we need to sleep because
you need to rest to detoxify.

00:21:44.220 --> 00:21:46.830 align:middle line:84%
And if you've got
charcoal working as an add

00:21:46.830 --> 00:21:49.260 align:middle line:84%
on to your filtration
mechanisms, your liver,

00:21:49.260 --> 00:21:52.030 align:middle line:90%
your kidneys, your spleen--

00:21:52.030 --> 00:21:54.480 align:middle line:84%
you've got an extra
filter happening there--

00:21:54.480 --> 00:21:56.100 align:middle line:90%
what happens?

00:21:56.100 --> 00:21:57.770 align:middle line:84%
You take the burden
off your organs.

00:21:57.770 --> 00:22:01.410 align:middle line:84%
So your body goes, well,
we don't-- we're good.

00:22:01.410 --> 00:22:03.760 align:middle line:84%
I know now because I'm
five years taking charcoal

00:22:03.760 --> 00:22:04.600 align:middle line:90%
almost every day.

00:22:04.600 --> 00:22:05.517 align:middle line:90%
I know the difference.

00:22:05.517 --> 00:22:06.540 align:middle line:90%
I know what it means.

00:22:06.540 --> 00:22:07.980 align:middle line:84%
If I have the
charcoal there, it's

00:22:07.980 --> 00:22:09.250 align:middle line:84%
like my body goes,
oh, thank god,

00:22:09.250 --> 00:22:10.040 align:middle line:84%
we would don't have
to deal with this.

00:22:10.040 --> 00:22:11.303 align:middle line:90%
We'll just-- jeez.

00:22:11.303 --> 00:22:12.720 align:middle line:84%
But if that
charcoal's not there--

00:22:12.720 --> 00:22:16.427 align:middle line:84%
like we went out last night
Au Lac in downtown LA.

00:22:16.427 --> 00:22:18.135 align:middle line:84%
All I had to do was
take seven charcoals.

00:22:18.135 --> 00:22:20.610 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:22:20.610 --> 00:22:22.677 align:middle line:90%
And I woke up fine this morning.

00:22:22.677 --> 00:22:28.390 align:middle line:84%
[LAUGHING] So there's a
lot of layers to this.

00:22:28.390 --> 00:22:29.822 align:middle line:90%
>> Take charcoal at night?

00:22:29.822 --> 00:22:31.530 align:middle line:84%
>> Or take it right
before you go to bed.

00:22:31.530 --> 00:22:32.950 align:middle line:84%
Of course I took it
right before I go to bed.

00:22:32.950 --> 00:22:34.783 align:middle line:84%
I take it right before
I go to bed and right

00:22:34.783 --> 00:22:36.040 align:middle line:90%
when I wake up in the morning.

00:22:36.040 --> 00:22:37.470 align:middle line:84%
Does it interfere
with medication?

00:22:37.470 --> 00:22:38.490 align:middle line:90%
It does.

00:22:38.490 --> 00:22:40.402 align:middle line:90%
It will neutralize medication.

00:22:40.402 --> 00:22:42.360 align:middle line:84%
It will neutralize certain
types of medication.

00:22:42.360 --> 00:22:44.693 align:middle line:84%
It will neutralize certain
types of secondary alkaloids.

00:22:44.693 --> 00:22:46.290 align:middle line:84%
But it does not
neutralize protein,

00:22:46.290 --> 00:22:50.838 align:middle line:84%
does not neutralize vitamin C,
does not neutralize B vitamins.

00:22:50.838 --> 00:22:52.380 align:middle line:84%
There's never been
any proof of that.

00:22:52.380 --> 00:22:55.020 align:middle line:84%
And that's a shocking statement
that you need to know.

00:22:55.020 --> 00:22:56.940 align:middle line:84%
No one has been able
to successfully prove

00:22:56.940 --> 00:23:00.450 align:middle line:84%
that charcoal absorbs
nutrients in 70 years.

00:23:00.450 --> 00:23:02.190 align:middle line:84%
More than that
now, it's 80 years

00:23:02.190 --> 00:23:04.290 align:middle line:84%
trying to prove that,
failed to prove it.

00:23:04.290 --> 00:23:06.210 align:middle line:84%
Not only is it have
they failed to prove it,

00:23:06.210 --> 00:23:09.210 align:middle line:84%
but every case that you
increase lifespan of the animals

00:23:09.210 --> 00:23:18.580 align:middle line:84%
by 20%, 21%, 24%, 30%, 33%,
34%, 41% even up to 47%.

00:23:18.580 --> 00:23:20.390 align:middle line:90%
Now, what's that mean for us?

00:23:20.390 --> 00:23:22.200 align:middle line:84%
If you're a human being, you're
supposed to get 100 years.

00:23:22.200 --> 00:23:23.520 align:middle line:84%
That would be the
natural, right?

00:23:23.520 --> 00:23:24.960 align:middle line:84%
If we were like everything
was perfect-- we didn't have

00:23:24.960 --> 00:23:26.543 align:middle line:84%
all this industry,
all this waste, all

00:23:26.543 --> 00:23:30.310 align:middle line:84%
this chaos, whatever, toxic
pollution, we'd get 100 years.

00:23:30.310 --> 00:23:37.030 align:middle line:84%
If you increased your lifespan
by 47%, that's 147 years--

00:23:37.030 --> 00:23:38.572 align:middle line:90%
147 years.

00:23:38.572 --> 00:23:39.530 align:middle line:90%
That's what that means.

00:23:39.530 --> 00:23:41.863 align:middle line:84%
And so there are people out
there, some of my favorites,

00:23:41.863 --> 00:23:44.680 align:middle line:84%
the Shivapuri Baba-- you
guys know the Shivapuri Baba?

00:23:44.680 --> 00:23:46.240 align:middle line:90%
This guy lived to be 137.

00:23:46.240 --> 00:23:47.980 align:middle line:90%
He was a great yogi.

00:23:47.980 --> 00:23:48.910 align:middle line:90%
This guy's so epic.

00:23:48.910 --> 00:23:50.030 align:middle line:84%
When you see him, you go,
(IMITATES INDIAN ACCENT)

00:23:50.030 --> 00:23:51.190 align:middle line:90%
please, hello.

00:23:51.190 --> 00:23:53.986 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:23:53.986 --> 00:23:55.390 align:middle line:90%


00:23:55.390 --> 00:23:57.852 align:middle line:10%
Apparently in this
picture, he was 110.

00:23:57.852 --> 00:24:00.310 align:middle line:10%
Now, I do have a picture of
him in this little presentation

00:24:00.310 --> 00:24:03.250 align:middle line:10%
here of him at 137,
the day, he died.

00:24:03.250 --> 00:24:05.320 align:middle line:84%
But these yogis
had a big secret,

00:24:05.320 --> 00:24:07.240 align:middle line:90%
so did the Taoist immortals.

00:24:07.240 --> 00:24:09.940 align:middle line:84%
They knew that black
foods, black substances

00:24:09.940 --> 00:24:12.040 align:middle line:90%
were associated with longevity.

00:24:12.040 --> 00:24:14.200 align:middle line:84%
Today, even the sadhus
still cover themselves

00:24:14.200 --> 00:24:15.400 align:middle line:90%
in the sacred ash.

00:24:15.400 --> 00:24:17.860 align:middle line:84%
But there's one piece that
never translated across,

00:24:17.860 --> 00:24:18.770 align:middle line:90%
I'm sure of it.

00:24:18.770 --> 00:24:21.760 align:middle line:84%
Studying Taoism all these
years and the connection

00:24:21.760 --> 00:24:26.440 align:middle line:84%
of black substance to longevity,
like shilajit, longevity, black

00:24:26.440 --> 00:24:31.270 align:middle line:84%
substance, longevity,
charcoal, eating the charcoal.

00:24:31.270 --> 00:24:34.690 align:middle line:84%
Now, that mythology, that
legend, that story did

00:24:34.690 --> 00:24:36.460 align:middle line:84%
survive in
Scandinavian mythology.

00:24:36.460 --> 00:24:38.410 align:middle line:90%
It's in the Icelandic Sagas.

00:24:38.410 --> 00:24:40.445 align:middle line:84%
They called it a coal
biter, the person

00:24:40.445 --> 00:24:42.820 align:middle line:84%
who was the run to the litter,
who was in the home, who'd

00:24:42.820 --> 00:24:46.030 align:middle line:84%
take care of the home fire
so that all the family that

00:24:46.030 --> 00:24:50.440 align:middle line:84%
was out hunting, fishing,
farming, out over the ocean,

00:24:50.440 --> 00:24:53.167 align:middle line:84%
in the fields, in the snow
and the ice and the sleet,

00:24:53.167 --> 00:24:55.750 align:middle line:84%
when they'd come back into their
home, there'd be a warm place

00:24:55.750 --> 00:24:56.782 align:middle line:90%
to come back into.

00:24:56.782 --> 00:24:58.240 align:middle line:84%
The kid who'd take
care of the fire

00:24:58.240 --> 00:24:59.470 align:middle line:84%
was always the
runt of the litter.

00:24:59.470 --> 00:25:00.803 align:middle line:10%
They were called the coal biter.

00:25:00.803 --> 00:25:03.580 align:middle line:84%
And they would eat through
their years of their 7, 8, 9, 10

00:25:03.580 --> 00:25:05.600 align:middle line:84%
years old, through the
years of their growth,

00:25:05.600 --> 00:25:06.610 align:middle line:90%
all the way up until 14.

00:25:06.610 --> 00:25:08.193 align:middle line:84%
They'd eat little
bits of the charcoal

00:25:08.193 --> 00:25:11.200 align:middle line:84%
at the edge of the fire, usually
birch or willow charcoal,

00:25:11.200 --> 00:25:12.730 align:middle line:90%
to be very specific.

00:25:12.730 --> 00:25:17.000 align:middle line:10%
And over that time, there'd
be a startling metamorphosis

00:25:17.000 --> 00:25:17.800 align:middle line:10%
that would occur.

00:25:17.800 --> 00:25:20.200 align:middle line:84%
This is in
Scandinavian mythology.

00:25:20.200 --> 00:25:22.000 align:middle line:90%
It's in the Scandinavian Sagas.

00:25:22.000 --> 00:25:26.800 align:middle line:84%
And JRR Tolkien named his
little group in Oxford

00:25:26.800 --> 00:25:29.920 align:middle line:84%
after this particular concept,
the coal biter, the charcoal

00:25:29.920 --> 00:25:32.800 align:middle line:84%
eater, that over
a period of, say,

00:25:32.800 --> 00:25:35.560 align:middle line:84%
seven years old to 14 years
old, that child had become

00:25:35.560 --> 00:25:38.740 align:middle line:84%
the most capable, the most
hardy, with the most ability

00:25:38.740 --> 00:25:42.430 align:middle line:84%
to survive the resilience
of the elements, right?

00:25:42.430 --> 00:25:43.810 align:middle line:84%
And that that
person would become

00:25:43.810 --> 00:25:46.720 align:middle line:84%
the one who would be out
there the latest, the longest,

00:25:46.720 --> 00:25:51.250 align:middle line:84%
the strongest, that would go
the furthest, the coal biter.

00:25:51.250 --> 00:25:53.767 align:middle line:84%
It's-- we're here in part
because of transformation.

00:25:53.767 --> 00:25:55.850 align:middle line:84%
We want to transform our
lives in some way, shape,

00:25:55.850 --> 00:25:56.650 align:middle line:90%
or form, right?

00:25:56.650 --> 00:25:57.640 align:middle line:90%
That's why we're here.

00:25:57.640 --> 00:25:59.515 align:middle line:84%
There is no better symbol
in the entire field

00:25:59.515 --> 00:26:02.230 align:middle line:84%
of nutrition of
transformation than charcoal.

00:26:02.230 --> 00:26:05.085 align:middle line:84%
It is the very symbol
of transformation.

00:26:05.085 --> 00:26:06.460 align:middle line:84%
But it can't do
anything for you,

00:26:06.460 --> 00:26:08.170 align:middle line:84%
just like an herb can't
do anything for you,

00:26:08.170 --> 00:26:10.337 align:middle line:84%
just like a super nutrient
can't do anything for you

00:26:10.337 --> 00:26:13.822 align:middle line:90%
unless you actually take it.

00:26:13.822 --> 00:26:15.610 align:middle line:10%
[LAUGHTER]

00:26:15.610 --> 00:26:16.410 align:middle line:10%
Right?

00:26:16.410 --> 00:26:17.368 align:middle line:10%
You've got to be in it.

00:26:17.368 --> 00:26:19.523 align:middle line:10%
You've got to actually do it.

00:26:19.523 --> 00:26:20.440 align:middle line:90%
This is another thing.

00:26:20.440 --> 00:26:21.440 align:middle line:90%
Take charcoal every day.

00:26:21.440 --> 00:26:24.185 align:middle line:84%
What happens is you're walking
around in this environment,

00:26:24.185 --> 00:26:26.560 align:middle line:84%
it's a sexual reaction with
the oxygen in the atmosphere.

00:26:26.560 --> 00:26:27.950 align:middle line:84%
The oxygen's very
positively charged.

00:26:27.950 --> 00:26:29.680 align:middle line:84%
This coal charcoal's
negatively charged.

00:26:29.680 --> 00:26:31.623 align:middle line:90%
It is attracted to you.

00:26:31.623 --> 00:26:33.790 align:middle line:84%
The more of a negative
charge you're carrying around

00:26:33.790 --> 00:26:36.190 align:middle line:84%
in you, the more that the
positive charge oxygen goes,

00:26:36.190 --> 00:26:36.990 align:middle line:90%
we want you.

00:26:36.990 --> 00:26:39.220 align:middle line:84%
We're going to pick you
instead of anybody else.

00:26:39.220 --> 00:26:41.130 align:middle line:10%
Does that makes sense?

00:26:41.130 --> 00:26:43.270 align:middle line:10%
Because you're a more
negative-charge polarity.

00:26:43.270 --> 00:26:44.170 align:middle line:90%
It's like at spring.

00:26:44.170 --> 00:26:46.337 align:middle line:84%
The spring doesn't come up
everywhere in the forest.

00:26:46.337 --> 00:26:49.240 align:middle line:84%
It only comes up in certain
spots in the forest.

00:26:49.240 --> 00:26:52.120 align:middle line:84%
And so like that
certain person, where

00:26:52.120 --> 00:26:53.800 align:middle line:84%
the spring is all--
everything that's

00:26:53.800 --> 00:26:56.230 align:middle line:84%
needed right there to
get that thing popping

00:26:56.230 --> 00:26:57.725 align:middle line:90%
right out in that spot.

00:26:57.725 --> 00:26:59.850 align:middle line:84%
Then if you're at a spring
long enough and you go--

00:26:59.850 --> 00:27:05.500 align:middle line:84%
[SNIFFING] you smell ozone
spiraling into that spring.

00:27:05.500 --> 00:27:08.110 align:middle line:84%
And only that place, because
the better quality oxygen

00:27:08.110 --> 00:27:11.911 align:middle line:84%
will be attracted to the
most negative polarity.

00:27:11.911 --> 00:27:14.050 align:middle line:90%
>> What about blood pressure?

00:27:14.050 --> 00:27:16.300 align:middle line:84%
>> There's nothing better
for your blood pressure than

00:27:16.300 --> 00:27:20.290 align:middle line:84%
getting the right amount
of hydration, right?

00:27:20.290 --> 00:27:21.217 align:middle line:90%
That's number one.

00:27:21.217 --> 00:27:23.800 align:middle line:84%
So getting the right amount of
hydration, number one for blood

00:27:23.800 --> 00:27:24.650 align:middle line:90%
pressure.

00:27:24.650 --> 00:27:27.190 align:middle line:84%
Now, you have to have the
right ratio of salt to water.

00:27:27.190 --> 00:27:30.540 align:middle line:84%
And first thing we want to
do is do the salt switch,

00:27:30.540 --> 00:27:33.060 align:middle line:84%
where we switch from
toxic salt that sneaks in

00:27:33.060 --> 00:27:34.195 align:middle line:90%
and all processed foods.

00:27:34.195 --> 00:27:36.362 align:middle line:84%
We've got to go-- if you
remember that little sign I

00:27:36.362 --> 00:27:39.270 align:middle line:84%
just put up there, we've got
to go organic and do the salt

00:27:39.270 --> 00:27:42.180 align:middle line:84%
switch and get off
that toxic stuff,

00:27:42.180 --> 00:27:45.000 align:middle line:84%
because that will definitely
elevate our blood pressure.

00:27:45.000 --> 00:27:49.620 align:middle line:84%
This is a sign my neighbor made
for me many years ago, organic.

00:27:49.620 --> 00:27:55.710 align:middle line:84%
[LAUGHING] And that
way we can start

00:27:55.710 --> 00:28:00.120 align:middle line:84%
to bring down aberrant
changes in our circulation

00:28:00.120 --> 00:28:00.987 align:middle line:90%
and metabolism.

00:28:00.987 --> 00:28:02.820 align:middle line:84%
But if we wanted to go
for like, hey, what's

00:28:02.820 --> 00:28:05.370 align:middle line:90%
the best, long-term solution?

00:28:05.370 --> 00:28:08.775 align:middle line:84%
Garlic, cayenne, reishi
mushroom, food, basically.

00:28:08.775 --> 00:28:10.380 align:middle line:84%
>> Do you like
like black garlic?

00:28:10.380 --> 00:28:12.060 align:middle line:90%
>> I love black garlic.

00:28:12.060 --> 00:28:13.050 align:middle line:90%
But what-- now we--

00:28:13.050 --> 00:28:14.950 align:middle line:84%
I just said something
about black.

00:28:14.950 --> 00:28:15.750 align:middle line:90%
We just heard it.

00:28:15.750 --> 00:28:16.710 align:middle line:90%
What was that about?

00:28:16.710 --> 00:28:17.790 align:middle line:90%
>> Longevity.

00:28:17.790 --> 00:28:20.460 align:middle line:84%
>> Black substances
increase longevity.

00:28:20.460 --> 00:28:22.240 align:middle line:84%
Black substances
increase longevity.

00:28:22.240 --> 00:28:25.890 align:middle line:84%
So when you hear black
garlic, you go, wait, what?

00:28:25.890 --> 00:28:26.790 align:middle line:90%
Black.

00:28:26.790 --> 00:28:30.100 align:middle line:84%
Red substance is
cardiovascular, right?

00:28:30.100 --> 00:28:30.900 align:middle line:90%
>> [INAUDIBLE]

00:28:30.900 --> 00:28:31.290 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, cool.

00:28:31.290 --> 00:28:32.730 align:middle line:90%
This is just playing by itself.

00:28:32.730 --> 00:28:33.965 align:middle line:90%
Let's see what it does.

00:28:33.965 --> 00:28:34.875 align:middle line:90%
>> [INAUDIBLE]

00:28:34.875 --> 00:28:36.240 align:middle line:90%
>> [INAUDIBLE] black garlic.

00:28:36.240 --> 00:28:39.440 align:middle line:90%
>> Let's see what happens.

00:28:39.440 --> 00:28:41.950 align:middle line:90%
Oh, let's leave it there.

00:28:41.950 --> 00:28:43.404 align:middle line:90%
That's a good one.

00:28:43.404 --> 00:28:45.814 align:middle line:84%
>> I've never heard
of black garlic.

00:28:45.814 --> 00:28:47.260 align:middle line:90%
>> I haven't either.

00:28:47.260 --> 00:28:49.040 align:middle line:90%
>> [LAUGHING] Black garlic--

00:28:49.040 --> 00:28:51.510 align:middle line:84%
black garlic is a
fermented garlic.

00:28:51.510 --> 00:28:55.760 align:middle line:84%
And it's basically an aged
garlic, and it turns it black.

00:28:55.760 --> 00:28:58.610 align:middle line:84%
Now, white foods
is renewal, right?

00:28:58.610 --> 00:29:00.920 align:middle line:84%
That's the tabula rasa,
right, the tabula rasa.

00:29:00.920 --> 00:29:02.690 align:middle line:90%
That's the blank slate.

00:29:02.690 --> 00:29:04.820 align:middle line:84%
So when somebody's
broken down digestively,

00:29:04.820 --> 00:29:10.278 align:middle line:90%
we go to white and black, right?

00:29:10.278 --> 00:29:11.820 align:middle line:84%
Just think about
it, white and black.

00:29:11.820 --> 00:29:13.510 align:middle line:84%
White foods, what's
a white food?

00:29:13.510 --> 00:29:14.310 align:middle line:90%
>> Onion.

00:29:14.310 --> 00:29:15.660 align:middle line:90%
Potato.

00:29:15.660 --> 00:29:18.847 align:middle line:90%
>> Coconut, rice, white rice.

00:29:18.847 --> 00:29:20.430 align:middle line:84%
And then gradually
the person, as they

00:29:20.430 --> 00:29:23.670 align:middle line:84%
regain their digestive power,
we go to more and more complex

00:29:23.670 --> 00:29:27.790 align:middle line:84%
colors, yellows, reds,
greens, et cetera.

00:29:27.790 --> 00:29:29.550 align:middle line:84%
Holt put out a
great article called

00:29:29.550 --> 00:29:32.040 align:middle line:84%
"The Black Bottle," which
changed all hospitals'

00:29:32.040 --> 00:29:35.340 align:middle line:90%
worldwide in 1962.

00:29:35.340 --> 00:29:40.200 align:middle line:84%
It was in 1962 that all
hospitals in the world

00:29:40.200 --> 00:29:42.330 align:middle line:84%
took on charcoal as the
first line of defense

00:29:42.330 --> 00:29:44.400 align:middle line:84%
in their emergency rooms
when someone came in

00:29:44.400 --> 00:29:46.410 align:middle line:90%
with acute poisoning.

00:29:46.410 --> 00:29:49.170 align:middle line:84%
Just take that-- just take
that-- bring that in deep,

00:29:49.170 --> 00:29:50.645 align:middle line:84%
take that in deep
what that means.

00:29:50.645 --> 00:29:52.020 align:middle line:84%
Acute poisoning,
what do you use?

00:29:52.020 --> 00:29:52.890 align:middle line:90%
Charcoal.

00:29:52.890 --> 00:29:54.870 align:middle line:84%
What's going on right
there on the freeway?

00:29:54.870 --> 00:29:57.180 align:middle line:84%
What's going on in all
our food and water, right?

00:29:57.180 --> 00:30:00.540 align:middle line:84%
It's acute poisoning,
every day, all day long.

00:30:00.540 --> 00:30:01.957 align:middle line:84%
Is this making
sense to everybody?

00:30:01.957 --> 00:30:02.757 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:30:02.757 --> 00:30:05.070 align:middle line:10%
If you are not actively
detoxifying your body

00:30:05.070 --> 00:30:07.920 align:middle line:10%
with as much tools as we have,
the best tools and the simplest

00:30:07.920 --> 00:30:09.822 align:middle line:10%
tools, charcoal,
then what's happening

00:30:09.822 --> 00:30:11.280 align:middle line:10%
is that we just
start accumulating.

00:30:11.280 --> 00:30:13.085 align:middle line:10%
We're going to start
accumulating waste.

00:30:13.085 --> 00:30:15.210 align:middle line:84%
And then our body at some
point, usually around 60,

00:30:15.210 --> 00:30:18.090 align:middle line:90%
goes, um, we're in trouble now.

00:30:18.090 --> 00:30:20.393 align:middle line:84%
And so we're going-- this--
we have to stop this one.

00:30:20.393 --> 00:30:21.810 align:middle line:84%
We have to stop
dealing with this.

00:30:21.810 --> 00:30:22.620 align:middle line:84%
We're going to have to
stop dealing with this.

00:30:22.620 --> 00:30:25.230 align:middle line:84%
And now we're going to have to
put those on the back juicer.

00:30:25.230 --> 00:30:27.390 align:middle line:84%
And now we're going to
have to fix this problem.

00:30:27.390 --> 00:30:28.493 align:middle line:90%
That's what happens.

00:30:28.493 --> 00:30:29.910 align:middle line:84%
And so what ends
up happening over

00:30:29.910 --> 00:30:32.260 align:middle line:84%
the years is that eventually
those problems accumulate,

00:30:32.260 --> 00:30:33.990 align:middle line:84%
and then it comes to
a metabolic burden

00:30:33.990 --> 00:30:36.950 align:middle line:84%
that the body can't
handle, and we break down.

00:30:36.950 --> 00:30:39.060 align:middle line:84%
Frolkis, the Russian
gerontologist I mentioned,

00:30:39.060 --> 00:30:41.820 align:middle line:84%
proved this repeatedly
because he found out

00:30:41.820 --> 00:30:44.400 align:middle line:84%
that even if you got
these rodents, animals,

00:30:44.400 --> 00:30:48.240 align:middle line:84%
whatever animals he was testing,
late in life on the charcoal,

00:30:48.240 --> 00:30:50.770 align:middle line:84%
they would still get great
benefit at an equivalent

00:30:50.770 --> 00:30:52.770 align:middle line:84%
of, say, 60 years of age
of a human being, which

00:30:52.770 --> 00:30:56.348 align:middle line:84%
would be say-- let's say you
started a mouse at two years.

00:30:56.348 --> 00:30:57.640 align:middle line:90%
So they never had any charcoal.

00:30:57.640 --> 00:30:59.010 align:middle line:90%
They ate a normal diet.

00:30:59.010 --> 00:31:01.650 align:middle line:84%
And then at two years you
start them on the charcoal.

00:31:01.650 --> 00:31:06.120 align:middle line:10%
He could extend their
life sometimes over 40%,

00:31:06.120 --> 00:31:09.720 align:middle line:10%
even starting late, which is
indicating and strengthening

00:31:09.720 --> 00:31:13.530 align:middle line:10%
the hypothesis that these
problems, these detoxification

00:31:13.530 --> 00:31:17.070 align:middle line:10%
problems, increase
as we age, right?

00:31:17.070 --> 00:31:18.090 align:middle line:90%
Of course.

00:31:18.090 --> 00:31:20.100 align:middle line:84%
And so that's why we've
got to stay on top of it

00:31:20.100 --> 00:31:20.910 align:middle line:90%
on the regular.

00:31:20.910 --> 00:31:23.100 align:middle line:84%
And not only that,
charcoal absorbs

00:31:23.100 --> 00:31:25.410 align:middle line:84%
all the most aggressive
toxins in our environment

00:31:25.410 --> 00:31:29.970 align:middle line:84%
from uranium to
glyphosate to mercury.

00:31:29.970 --> 00:31:31.680 align:middle line:84%

00:33:30.510 --> 00:33:32.470 align:middle line:84%
That's ultimately
what it's doing.

That's why I always come
in with the irrational

00:33:34.582 --> 00:33:36.540 align:middle line:84%
because you have to have
one to have the other.

00:33:36.540 --> 00:33:38.190 align:middle line:84%
You can't have a
rational reality

00:33:38.190 --> 00:33:39.592 align:middle line:90%

So the scientism is saying, it's
only rational, only material!

00:33:48.082 --> 00:33:49.290 align:middle line:90%
Then you go, what about this?

00:33:49.290 --> 00:33:52.950 align:middle line:84%
And they go, that's bad
science, or that can't exist,

00:33:52.950 --> 00:33:54.150 align:middle line:90%
or we have to ignore that.

00:34:02.550 --> 00:34:03.810 align:middle line:90%
because we can't deal with it.

00:34:03.810 --> 00:34:05.910 align:middle line:10%
And our whole
reality, all of us,

00:34:05.910 --> 00:34:08.130 align:middle line:10%
every reality that
we think is real

00:34:08.130 --> 00:34:11.370 align:middle line:10%
is a little tiny little sliver
of this little false, little

00:34:11.370 --> 00:34:12.255 align:middle line:10%
rational reality.

00:34:12.255 --> 00:34:15.139 align:middle line:10%
It has nothing to do with
the actual overall reality

00:34:15.139 --> 00:34:17.510 align:middle line:10%
because we excluded
all the information we

00:34:17.510 --> 00:34:19.610 align:middle line:10%
couldn't deal with.

00:34:19.610 --> 00:34:21.170 align:middle line:10%
We got rid of it.

00:34:21.170 --> 00:34:22.102 align:middle line:90%
And we forgot it.

00:34:22.102 --> 00:34:23.810 align:middle line:84%
And we've forgotten
what we've forgotten.

00:34:23.810 --> 00:34:24.873 align:middle line:90%
We've so forgotten it.

00:34:24.873 --> 00:34:26.290 align:middle line:84%
Does that make
sense to everybody?

00:34:26.290 --> 00:34:29.929 align:middle line:10%
Just like in order to
have a happy, healthy life

00:34:29.929 --> 00:34:32.900 align:middle line:10%
from the inside in the
core, the materialism

00:34:32.900 --> 00:34:34.820 align:middle line:10%
and the hyper-rational
mind needs

00:34:34.820 --> 00:34:38.148 align:middle line:10%
to get pushed down
because it will destroy.

00:34:38.148 --> 00:34:40.190 align:middle line:84%
It's one of most destructive
forces in the world.

00:34:40.190 --> 00:34:42.148 align:middle line:90%
It's religious fundamentalism.

00:34:42.148 --> 00:34:43.190 align:middle line:90%
That's what scientism is.

00:34:43.190 --> 00:34:44.690 align:middle line:90%
It's religious fundamentalism.

00:34:44.690 --> 00:34:46.150 align:middle line:90%
Our way is the way.

00:34:46.150 --> 00:34:47.360 align:middle line:90%
And it's the only way.

00:34:47.360 --> 00:34:49.439 align:middle line:84%
Unless it fits into our
little box right here,

00:34:49.439 --> 00:34:50.239 align:middle line:90%
it doesn't exist.

00:34:50.239 --> 00:34:51.489 align:middle line:90%
We're not going to look at it.

00:34:51.489 --> 00:34:53.900 align:middle line:84%
So we won't look at
dangers of toxins

00:34:53.900 --> 00:34:57.560 align:middle line:84%
being in injections or
possible dangers of what's

00:34:57.560 --> 00:34:59.810 align:middle line:84%
going on in hospitals
today because no, no, no,

00:34:59.810 --> 00:35:00.710 align:middle line:90%
science is right.

00:35:00.710 --> 00:35:01.970 align:middle line:10%
And we can't look at--

00:35:01.970 --> 00:35:03.030 align:middle line:10%
there can't be a mistake.

00:35:03.030 --> 00:35:03.830 align:middle line:90%
And it's rational.

00:35:03.830 --> 00:35:05.480 align:middle line:90%
We figured this out.

00:35:05.480 --> 00:35:07.532 align:middle line:90%
You see where this goes?

00:35:07.532 --> 00:35:08.900 align:middle line:90%
>> Ahrimanic.

00:35:08.900 --> 00:35:09.950 align:middle line:90%
>> It's ahrimanic.

00:35:09.950 --> 00:35:12.170 align:middle line:84%
Rudolf Steiner said
it was ahrimanic.

00:35:12.170 --> 00:35:14.240 align:middle line:84%
It's an-- we're under
an ahrimanic deception,

00:35:14.240 --> 00:35:17.570 align:middle line:90%
big time, major.

00:35:17.570 --> 00:35:19.880 align:middle line:84%
You look at the default
position of every hospital,

00:35:19.880 --> 00:35:21.350 align:middle line:90%
and it's a pill for every ill.

00:35:21.350 --> 00:35:23.480 align:middle line:84%
Cut, burn, poison therapy
are purely ahrimanic,

00:35:23.480 --> 00:35:25.070 align:middle line:90%
purely rational mind.

00:35:25.070 --> 00:35:26.850 align:middle line:84%
There's no sense of
the emotional body.

00:35:26.850 --> 00:35:28.475 align:middle line:84%
There's no sense of
the spiritual body.

00:35:28.475 --> 00:35:30.930 align:middle line:84%
There's no sense of the
attitude and mental capacity

00:35:30.930 --> 00:35:31.730 align:middle line:90%
of the person.

00:35:31.730 --> 00:35:33.610 align:middle line:84%
There's no sense of the
whole person's whole history.

00:35:33.610 --> 00:35:34.985 align:middle line:84%
It's just strictly
down, stripped

00:35:34.985 --> 00:35:37.460 align:middle line:84%
down to the materialism right
to the ahrimanic deception

00:35:37.460 --> 00:35:38.990 align:middle line:84%
of like, oh, it's just
a pill for every ill.

00:35:38.990 --> 00:35:39.440 align:middle line:90%
You have this ill.

00:35:39.440 --> 00:35:40.700 align:middle line:84%
We're going to
give you this pill.

00:35:40.700 --> 00:35:41.617 align:middle line:90%
>> Not even nutrition.

00:35:41.617 --> 00:35:44.450 align:middle line:84%
>> Not even
nutrition, not even--

00:35:44.450 --> 00:35:45.860 align:middle line:90%
we're lucky if you get jello.

00:35:45.860 --> 00:35:48.150 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:35:48.150 --> 00:35:48.950 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:35:48.950 --> 00:35:49.640 align:middle line:90%
Do you see?

00:35:49.640 --> 00:35:50.960 align:middle line:84%
See, that makes it real
because it's like, oh,

00:35:50.960 --> 00:35:52.190 align:middle line:90%
what is he talking about?

00:35:52.190 --> 00:35:52.990 align:middle line:90%
What do you mean?

00:35:52.990 --> 00:35:54.680 align:middle line:84%
It's like come on,
what do you mean?

00:35:54.680 --> 00:35:57.230 align:middle line:84%
The default position of
our entire civilization,

00:35:57.230 --> 00:36:01.250 align:middle line:84%
all government
organizations, definitely

00:36:01.250 --> 00:36:03.920 align:middle line:84%
any kind of health
care whatsoever

00:36:03.920 --> 00:36:07.460 align:middle line:84%
is all pure ahrimanic
deception, pure.

00:36:07.460 --> 00:36:09.960 align:middle line:84%
Scientism, science is
going to figure it out.

00:36:09.960 --> 00:36:11.740 align:middle line:84%
And then when science figures
out something else, they go,

00:36:11.740 --> 00:36:13.510 align:middle line:84%
oh, well, that can't--
wait, that was bad science,

00:36:13.510 --> 00:36:15.920 align:middle line:84%
or that person, so we gotta get
rid of that person because they

00:36:15.920 --> 00:36:18.050 align:middle line:84%
found out something that wasn't
fitting our materialistic

00:36:18.050 --> 00:36:18.770 align:middle line:90%
belief system.

00:36:18.770 --> 00:36:19.687 align:middle line:90%
We'll get rid of them.

00:36:19.687 --> 00:36:22.150 align:middle line:90%


00:36:22.150 --> 00:36:24.160 align:middle line:84%
Science is different
than scientism.

00:36:24.160 --> 00:36:26.524 align:middle line:84%
Science is scientific
method only--

00:36:26.524 --> 00:36:29.350 align:middle line:84%
only-- nothing else,
no belief systems.

00:36:29.350 --> 00:36:33.580 align:middle line:84%
Nothing else is attached to
it, just scientific method.

00:36:33.580 --> 00:36:37.060 align:middle line:84%
Anything beyond that-- oh,
you have to believe in this

00:36:37.060 --> 00:36:39.130 align:middle line:90%
to do science is scientism.

00:36:39.130 --> 00:36:40.360 align:middle line:90%
That's some kind of religion.

00:36:40.360 --> 00:36:41.200 align:middle line:84%
What do you mean
I have to believe?

00:36:41.200 --> 00:36:42.040 align:middle line:90%
What are you talking about?

00:36:42.040 --> 00:36:42.840 align:middle line:90%
There's no beliefs.

00:36:42.840 --> 00:36:44.410 align:middle line:90%
This is science.

00:36:44.410 --> 00:36:48.580 align:middle line:84%
But today all institutions,
you have to believe this XYZ.

00:36:48.580 --> 00:36:50.080 align:middle line:84%
You have to believe
in the Big Bang.

00:36:50.080 --> 00:36:52.520 align:middle line:84%
You have to believe
this other crap.

00:36:52.520 --> 00:36:54.992 align:middle line:90%
Is this making sense to anybody?

00:36:54.992 --> 00:36:57.447 align:middle line:90%
[SOUNDS OF ASSENT]

00:36:57.447 --> 00:37:01.380 align:middle line:90%


00:37:01.380 --> 00:37:05.310 align:middle line:84%
Because they know what I'm
coming in with, which is we're

00:37:05.310 --> 00:37:07.035 align:middle line:84%
coming in with other
than scientism,

00:37:07.035 --> 00:37:10.620 align:middle line:84%
or we're pointing out the
mistakes of scientism.

00:37:10.620 --> 00:37:12.300 align:middle line:84%
Because basically
it's obvious, right?

00:37:12.300 --> 00:37:13.960 align:middle line:90%
Science gets bullied.

00:37:13.960 --> 00:37:15.480 align:middle line:90%
Like, our truths are not truths.

00:37:15.480 --> 00:37:18.480 align:middle line:84%
They're bullied in
by forces, right,

00:37:18.480 --> 00:37:23.790 align:middle line:84%
big industrial forces, big
banking forces, big money,

00:37:23.790 --> 00:37:25.748 align:middle line:84%
big government forces,
bullies in the position.

00:37:25.748 --> 00:37:27.998 align:middle line:84%
This is what we're going to
get the people to believe.

00:37:27.998 --> 00:37:29.370 align:middle line:90%
And this is it right here.

00:37:29.370 --> 00:37:31.180 align:middle line:90%
Is it that?

00:37:31.180 --> 00:37:31.980 align:middle line:90%
Is it that?

00:37:31.980 --> 00:37:33.072 align:middle line:90%
>> Not really.

00:37:33.072 --> 00:37:35.280 align:middle line:10%
>> No, because there's always
another side because we

00:37:35.280 --> 00:37:37.380 align:middle line:10%
don't live in a completely
rational reality.

00:37:37.380 --> 00:37:40.120 align:middle line:84%
It's a rational-irrational
construct, like we are.

00:37:40.120 --> 00:37:43.830 align:middle line:84%
Every guy knows
that their wife is

00:37:43.830 --> 00:37:45.180 align:middle line:90%
a rational-irrational construct.

00:37:45.180 --> 00:37:46.840 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:37:46.840 --> 00:37:47.640 align:middle line:90%


00:37:47.640 --> 00:37:50.070 align:middle line:10%
And every woman
knows that their man

00:37:50.070 --> 00:37:55.000 align:middle line:10%
is a rational-irrational
construct.

00:37:55.000 --> 00:37:57.418 align:middle line:10%
It's super-- actually
Rudolf Steiner

00:37:57.418 --> 00:37:58.460 align:middle line:10%
called it super sensible.

00:37:58.460 --> 00:38:01.170 align:middle line:84%
It's super obvious
totally obvious.

00:38:01.170 --> 00:38:03.275 align:middle line:84%
Then it's like, OK,
what about nutrition?

00:38:03.275 --> 00:38:05.400 align:middle line:84%
What are the most important
nutrients in nutrition?

00:38:05.400 --> 00:38:07.350 align:middle line:84%
From my perspective,
number-one nutrient

00:38:07.350 --> 00:38:11.670 align:middle line:84%
for nutrition of a human being
is DHA, is your omega-3 fatty

00:38:11.670 --> 00:38:15.940 align:middle line:84%
acid, your super omega-3 fatty
acid, docosahexaenoic acid,

00:38:15.940 --> 00:38:17.940 align:middle line:90%
which is your super transporter.

00:38:17.940 --> 00:38:21.180 align:middle line:84%
It's basically what's converting
the light into electrons, even

00:38:21.180 --> 00:38:22.560 align:middle line:90%
right through your eyes.

00:38:22.560 --> 00:38:25.110 align:middle line:84%
It is the main thing that
makes you a human being, right,

00:38:25.110 --> 00:38:26.690 align:middle line:90%
your eye and your brain.

00:38:26.690 --> 00:38:28.253 align:middle line:90%
This is so important.

00:38:28.253 --> 00:38:29.670 align:middle line:84%
The thing that
makes you different

00:38:29.670 --> 00:38:31.462 align:middle line:84%
than any other creature
on the earth is you

00:38:31.462 --> 00:38:33.150 align:middle line:90%
have a big, old head.

00:38:33.150 --> 00:38:34.140 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:38:34.140 --> 00:38:34.530 align:middle line:90%
>> Right?

00:38:34.530 --> 00:38:35.210 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:38:35.210 --> 00:38:35.760 align:middle line:90%
>> You look around.

00:38:35.760 --> 00:38:37.677 align:middle line:84%
You're like, dude, humans
have big, old heads.

00:38:37.677 --> 00:38:38.530 align:middle line:90%
What's the deal?

00:38:38.530 --> 00:38:40.530 align:middle line:84%
We don't think about it
that often because we've

00:38:40.530 --> 00:38:41.623 align:middle line:90%
seen pictures of aliens.

00:38:41.623 --> 00:38:44.040 align:middle line:84%
And they have a big, old head,
bigger than us or whatever,

00:38:44.040 --> 00:38:45.690 align:middle line:90%
right?

00:38:45.690 --> 00:38:48.363 align:middle line:84%
But if we just take it
back to real every day,

00:38:48.363 --> 00:38:50.530 align:middle line:84%
when you look around, you
go, like, what's going on?

00:38:50.530 --> 00:38:52.830 align:middle line:90%
The human as a big, old head.

00:38:52.830 --> 00:38:54.180 align:middle line:90%
And then-- proportionally.

00:38:54.180 --> 00:38:59.860 align:middle line:84%
And then also we have very
strong visual capabilities.

00:38:59.860 --> 00:39:02.880 align:middle line:84%
That's a major thing about
a human being, right?

00:39:02.880 --> 00:39:07.680 align:middle line:84%
Our visual capabilities are one
of the things that defines us.

00:39:07.680 --> 00:39:11.700 align:middle line:84%
The way we determine
everything is visual and video

00:39:11.700 --> 00:39:13.950 align:middle line:84%
and the way that video's
transformed, everything.

00:39:13.950 --> 00:39:17.770 align:middle line:84%
And our visual acuity is a
very big part of our life.

00:39:17.770 --> 00:39:21.120 align:middle line:84%
What is the main nutrient
for our brain and our eyes

00:39:21.120 --> 00:39:23.460 align:middle line:84%
and the unique nervous
system that a human has

00:39:23.460 --> 00:39:25.020 align:middle line:90%
is DHA, docosahexaenoic acid.

00:39:25.020 --> 00:39:26.790 align:middle line:90%
It's omega-3 fatty acid.

00:39:26.790 --> 00:39:28.900 align:middle line:84%
There are three
omega-3 fatty acids.

00:39:28.900 --> 00:39:31.350 align:middle line:84%
So I think I got a
little bit of that here.

00:39:31.350 --> 00:39:32.630 align:middle line:90%
I want to put that in here.

00:39:32.630 --> 00:39:33.430 align:middle line:90%
There it is.

00:39:33.430 --> 00:39:33.860 align:middle line:90%
Jeez!

00:39:33.860 --> 00:39:34.380 align:middle line:90%
Oh, my god.

00:39:34.380 --> 00:39:35.680 align:middle line:90%
>> Is this at your booth?

00:39:35.680 --> 00:39:37.200 align:middle line:90%
>> This is at our booth, yeah.

00:39:37.200 --> 00:39:40.410 align:middle line:84%
So this is the symbiotic of
the omega, which is essentially

00:39:40.410 --> 00:39:44.850 align:middle line:84%
that's your DHA
from algae, which

00:39:44.850 --> 00:39:47.503 align:middle line:90%
is where the fish get it from.

00:39:47.503 --> 00:39:49.920 align:middle line:84%
Because if you've you been
paying attention, omega-3 fatty

00:39:49.920 --> 00:39:51.610 align:middle line:90%
acids, there are three.

00:39:51.610 --> 00:39:53.370 align:middle line:84%
Two of them are
marine in origin.

00:39:53.370 --> 00:39:54.850 align:middle line:90%
One of them is terrestrial.

00:39:54.850 --> 00:39:57.250 align:middle line:84%
The one that's terrestrial,
like what's in chia seed?

00:39:57.250 --> 00:39:58.050 align:middle line:90%
>> ALA.

00:39:58.050 --> 00:39:59.090 align:middle line:90%
>> ALA.

00:39:59.090 --> 00:40:00.520 align:middle line:90%
What's in hemp seed?

00:40:00.520 --> 00:40:01.320 align:middle line:90%
ALA.

00:40:01.320 --> 00:40:02.445 align:middle line:90%
What's in evening primrose?

00:40:02.445 --> 00:40:04.200 align:middle line:90%
ALA and GLA, right?

00:40:04.200 --> 00:40:06.840 align:middle line:10%
Most of the stuff on land,
almost all of it is ALA.

00:40:06.840 --> 00:40:08.830 align:middle line:10%
That's one of the
three that we need.

00:40:08.830 --> 00:40:10.440 align:middle line:10%
But we also have
this other part of us

00:40:10.440 --> 00:40:15.150 align:middle line:10%
which is the aquatic
part of us, which needs

00:40:15.150 --> 00:40:17.680 align:middle line:10%
two marine omega-3 fatty acids.

00:40:17.680 --> 00:40:20.490 align:middle line:10%
Now, fish oil was the way that
most people got that for most

00:40:20.490 --> 00:40:21.988 align:middle line:10%
of our history on Earth.

00:40:21.988 --> 00:40:23.280 align:middle line:10%
Where did the fish get it from?

00:40:23.280 --> 00:40:24.660 align:middle line:90%
>> Marine phytoplankton.

00:40:24.660 --> 00:40:26.550 align:middle line:84%
>> Yep, they get it
from phytoplankton.

00:40:26.550 --> 00:40:29.820 align:middle line:84%
And so we've gone all over the
world, all over Canada, all

00:40:29.820 --> 00:40:32.800 align:middle line:84%
over Iceland to get
the best in the world.

00:40:32.800 --> 00:40:33.600 align:middle line:90%
That's--

00:40:33.600 --> 00:40:34.110 align:middle line:90%
>> Is that marine?

00:40:34.110 --> 00:40:35.820 align:middle line:84%
>> This is marine
phytoplankton from--

00:40:35.820 --> 00:40:42.840 align:middle line:84%
this is plankton-derived DHA
and EPA, so not from fish.

00:40:42.840 --> 00:40:44.550 align:middle line:90%
So it's vegan.

00:40:44.550 --> 00:40:45.790 align:middle line:90%
This is a big deal.

00:40:45.790 --> 00:40:47.100 align:middle line:84%
We've been trying to figure
this out for a long time,

00:40:47.100 --> 00:40:47.460 align:middle line:90%
haven't we?

00:40:47.460 --> 00:40:48.520 align:middle line:90%
It's been a long time.

00:40:48.520 --> 00:40:50.270 align:middle line:84%
Now, this has been
going on now for years.

00:40:50.270 --> 00:40:51.780 align:middle line:90%
So we've-- this--

00:40:51.780 --> 00:40:54.690 align:middle line:84%
everyday I get up, and I do
my little water and charcoal.

00:40:54.690 --> 00:40:58.620 align:middle line:84%
Then maybe an hour later I'll,
boom, hit this right here.

00:40:58.620 --> 00:40:59.700 align:middle line:90%
It's like a squirt thing.

00:40:59.700 --> 00:41:00.575 align:middle line:90%
I have it right here.

00:41:00.575 --> 00:41:02.100 align:middle line:90%
I'll show you.

00:41:02.100 --> 00:41:03.810 align:middle line:84%
It's a really cool
delivery system.

00:41:03.810 --> 00:41:05.795 align:middle line:90%
We tried to do this in gel caps.

00:41:05.795 --> 00:41:07.420 align:middle line:84%
We tried to do this
every way possible.

00:41:07.420 --> 00:41:08.620 align:middle line:90%
It did not work.

00:41:08.620 --> 00:41:09.880 align:middle line:90%
It really did not work.

00:41:09.880 --> 00:41:11.490 align:middle line:90%
It was really the worst ever.

00:41:11.490 --> 00:41:15.170 align:middle line:90%
But this-- this finally worked.

00:41:15.170 --> 00:41:16.180 align:middle line:90%
And it's just like that.

00:41:16.180 --> 00:41:16.980 align:middle line:84%
You don't have to
keep in the fridge,

00:41:16.980 --> 00:41:19.080 align:middle line:84%
but it's nicer if you
keep it in the fridge.

00:41:19.080 --> 00:41:21.960 align:middle line:84%
It's sealed in Miron glass, our
friends over at Miron glass.

00:41:21.960 --> 00:41:24.480 align:middle line:84%
Miron glass, you guys
are into Miron glass?

00:41:24.480 --> 00:41:27.750 align:middle line:84%
Many years-- I promoted
them for 20 years.

00:41:27.750 --> 00:41:31.020 align:middle line:84%
One day the owner of the company
called me, out of nowhere.

00:41:31.020 --> 00:41:32.540 align:middle line:90%
He said, come over.

00:41:32.540 --> 00:41:33.930 align:middle line:90%
He lives in Amsterdam.

00:41:33.930 --> 00:41:35.610 align:middle line:84%
They moved the
company from, I think,

00:41:35.610 --> 00:41:37.810 align:middle line:84%
Switzerland over to Amsterdam
or outside Amsterdam.

00:41:37.810 --> 00:41:39.435 align:middle line:84%
So next time I went
to Amsterdam, boom,

00:41:39.435 --> 00:41:40.950 align:middle line:84%
next thing I know
I'm in his office.

00:41:40.950 --> 00:41:42.700 align:middle line:84%
I'm sitting down with
him, and I'm looking

00:41:42.700 --> 00:41:44.313 align:middle line:90%
at his research on Miron glass.

00:41:44.313 --> 00:41:46.980 align:middle line:84%
There's a very interesting thing
that I had been on at that time

00:41:46.980 --> 00:41:48.147 align:middle line:90%
in researching at that time.

00:41:48.147 --> 00:41:50.440 align:middle line:84%
And that had been a
compound called quercetin.

00:41:50.440 --> 00:41:51.690 align:middle line:90%
You guys know about quercetin?

00:41:51.690 --> 00:41:56.820 align:middle line:84%
Quercetin is the happy molecule,
the antidepressant molecule

00:41:56.820 --> 00:41:59.165 align:middle line:84%
that's in all your fresh
fruits and vegetables.

00:41:59.165 --> 00:42:01.290 align:middle line:84%
It's impossible to find
any fruit or vegetable that

00:42:01.290 --> 00:42:01.860 align:middle line:90%
doesn't have it.

00:42:01.860 --> 00:42:03.480 align:middle line:84%
It's in every fruit
and vegetable.

00:42:03.480 --> 00:42:05.220 align:middle line:84%
And what's interesting
about quercetin

00:42:05.220 --> 00:42:09.930 align:middle line:84%
is it exactly allows in a
particular frequency of light,

00:42:09.930 --> 00:42:12.090 align:middle line:84%
which, just by
chance, as I'm looking

00:42:12.090 --> 00:42:14.262 align:middle line:84%
through the data on
Miron glass, is exactly

00:42:14.262 --> 00:42:16.470 align:middle line:84%
the frequency of light that
Miron glass lets through,

00:42:16.470 --> 00:42:19.740 align:middle line:84%
which is 380 nanometers
of light, which is just

00:42:19.740 --> 00:42:21.390 align:middle line:90%
into the ultraviolet range.

00:42:21.390 --> 00:42:25.440 align:middle line:84%
It's a very specific
area that is allowed in.

00:42:25.440 --> 00:42:27.420 align:middle line:84%
And then I was suddenly
cross referencing

00:42:27.420 --> 00:42:30.630 align:middle line:84%
that with David Wilcock's
stuff on Fritz-Albert Popp.

00:42:30.630 --> 00:42:33.810 align:middle line:84%
And Fritz-Albert Popp found out
that carcinogens all share one

00:42:33.810 --> 00:42:35.580 align:middle line:84%
thing in common,
and that is they

00:42:35.580 --> 00:42:40.950 align:middle line:90%
block 380 nanometers of light.

00:42:40.950 --> 00:42:43.560 align:middle line:84%
In that dude's office that
day, all three of those things

00:42:43.560 --> 00:42:45.110 align:middle line:90%
came together for me.

00:42:45.110 --> 00:42:47.875 align:middle line:84%
I was-- there was the research
on 380 nanometers of light,

00:42:47.875 --> 00:42:50.310 align:middle line:84%
and its carcinogenic
properties if you block it.

00:42:50.310 --> 00:42:53.210 align:middle line:84%
There's the quercetin, and
then there's the Miron glass.

00:42:53.210 --> 00:42:55.300 align:middle line:84%
I was like, that's
interesting, right?

00:42:55.300 --> 00:42:57.300 align:middle line:84%
Makes you think that there
are other powers that

00:42:57.300 --> 00:42:59.010 align:middle line:90%
are at work, right?

00:42:59.010 --> 00:43:02.670 align:middle line:10%
If your life was totally random,
as scientism thinks it is,

00:43:02.670 --> 00:43:05.733 align:middle line:10%
none of the magic of your life
could possibly have happened.

00:43:05.733 --> 00:43:07.650 align:middle line:10%
None of the magic of
your kids, your children,

00:43:07.650 --> 00:43:10.920 align:middle line:10%
your life story couldn't--
just impossible if there

00:43:10.920 --> 00:43:14.625 align:middle line:10%
wasn't an irrational force
that was at work in your life,

00:43:14.625 --> 00:43:16.692 align:middle line:10%
a force that is
above and beyond you.

00:43:16.692 --> 00:43:18.150 align:middle line:84%
Does that makes
sense to everybody?

00:43:18.150 --> 00:43:18.750 align:middle line:90%
I have faith.

00:43:18.750 --> 00:43:20.100 align:middle line:84%
I know I have faith
because I've been saying

00:43:20.100 --> 00:43:20.970 align:middle line:90%
every day's the best day ever.

00:43:20.970 --> 00:43:23.428 align:middle line:84%
And jeez, you cannot believe
what that precipitates for you

00:43:23.428 --> 00:43:24.508 align:middle line:90%
every day.

00:43:24.508 --> 00:43:25.800 align:middle line:90%
You can't believe what happens.

00:43:25.800 --> 00:43:27.080 align:middle line:84%
All of a sudden you're
just like, what?

00:43:27.080 --> 00:43:29.130 align:middle line:10%
Every day, for years,
how could it get better?

00:43:29.130 --> 00:43:30.060 align:middle line:84%
And then all of a
sudden, this happens,

00:43:30.060 --> 00:43:31.680 align:middle line:84%
that happens, this thing
happens, another thing.

00:43:31.680 --> 00:43:32.910 align:middle line:90%
You're like, OK, I have faith.

00:43:32.910 --> 00:43:34.020 align:middle line:84%
If I keep saying it's
the best day ever,

00:43:34.020 --> 00:43:34.830 align:middle line:84%
it's going to be
the best day ever.

00:43:34.830 --> 00:43:36.262 align:middle line:90%
This is how you do this.

00:43:36.262 --> 00:43:41.230 align:middle line:84%
>> So black charcoal
blocks 380 nanometers.

00:43:41.230 --> 00:43:43.260 align:middle line:90%
>> Look into it.

00:43:43.260 --> 00:43:47.108 align:middle line:10%
Check out your research on
charcoal and see what it blocks

00:43:47.108 --> 00:43:48.150 align:middle line:10%
and what it lets through.

00:43:48.150 --> 00:43:50.640 align:middle line:10%
>> [INAUDIBLE] together though.

00:43:50.640 --> 00:43:52.140 align:middle line:10%
[INAUDIBLE]

00:43:52.140 --> 00:43:53.520 align:middle line:10%
>> Well, this is not--

00:43:53.520 --> 00:43:54.870 align:middle line:10%
this is myceliated.

00:43:54.870 --> 00:43:57.030 align:middle line:10%
This is so bioavailable
it goes right

00:43:57.030 --> 00:43:58.440 align:middle line:10%
into your mucosa of your mouth.

00:43:58.440 --> 00:44:01.320 align:middle line:10%
This-- the B12, this is the DHA.

00:44:01.320 --> 00:44:05.820 align:middle line:84%
The next one I want to talk
about is B12, homocysteine.

00:44:05.820 --> 00:44:07.600 align:middle line:90%
B12 is this one.

00:44:07.600 --> 00:44:09.670 align:middle line:84%
B12-- let's see,
do this one here.

00:44:09.670 --> 00:44:11.554 align:middle line:90%
>> What else is in the omega?

00:44:11.554 --> 00:44:12.970 align:middle line:90%
[INAUDIBLE]

00:44:12.970 --> 00:44:15.550 align:middle line:84%
>> Oh, there's asked to sea
buckthorn, yeah, astaxanthin,

00:44:15.550 --> 00:44:16.360 align:middle line:90%
sea buckthorn.

00:44:16.360 --> 00:44:17.680 align:middle line:90%
>> Is that [INAUDIBLE]?

00:44:17.680 --> 00:44:18.720 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:44:18.720 --> 00:44:20.480 align:middle line:90%
>> [INAUDIBLE]

00:44:20.480 --> 00:44:21.280 align:middle line:90%
>> It's all one.

00:44:21.280 --> 00:44:22.690 align:middle line:84%
>> How many squirts
will that do?

00:44:22.690 --> 00:44:24.820 align:middle line:90%
>> I just did probably eight.

00:44:24.820 --> 00:44:25.790 align:middle line:90%
I usually do 10.

00:44:25.790 --> 00:44:26.590 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:44:26.590 --> 00:44:27.415 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:44:27.415 --> 00:44:28.290 align:middle line:90%
Now, this is the B12.

00:44:28.290 --> 00:44:29.884 align:middle line:90%
Watch this.

00:44:29.884 --> 00:44:30.760 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:44:30.760 --> 00:44:32.080 align:middle line:90%
>> I'm watching.

00:44:32.080 --> 00:44:33.705 align:middle line:84%
>> In my mouth, it
absorbs right there.

00:44:33.705 --> 00:44:34.622 align:middle line:90%
I don't have to worry.

00:44:34.622 --> 00:44:36.950 align:middle line:84%
It's never going-- it's
never making it into here.

00:44:36.950 --> 00:44:37.750 align:middle line:90%
It goes right in.

00:44:37.750 --> 00:44:38.550 align:middle line:90%
It's myceliated.

00:44:38.550 --> 00:44:41.110 align:middle line:84%
It's more powerful
than an injection.

00:44:41.110 --> 00:44:42.550 align:middle line:90%
What's myceliated?

00:44:42.550 --> 00:44:46.130 align:middle line:84%
The molecule's wrapped up
in phosphatidylcholine,

00:44:46.130 --> 00:44:48.130 align:middle line:84%
which is-- you know what
phosphatidylcholine is?

00:44:48.130 --> 00:44:50.860 align:middle line:84%
It's one of the main
nutrients in your brain.

00:44:50.860 --> 00:44:54.880 align:middle line:84%
DHA phosphatidylcholine,
that's the matrix and structure

00:44:54.880 --> 00:44:57.500 align:middle line:90%
of your nervous system tissue.

00:44:57.500 --> 00:45:02.020 align:middle line:84%
B12 is mycieliated, so
it's adenosylcobalamin,

00:45:02.020 --> 00:45:06.880 align:middle line:84%
methylcobalamin, and B9,
L-methylfolate, right?

00:45:06.880 --> 00:45:08.620 align:middle line:84%
So it's the right
L-methylfolate.

00:45:08.620 --> 00:45:12.160 align:middle line:84%
So for MTHFR, people have
that gene mutation or both

00:45:12.160 --> 00:45:13.510 align:middle line:90%
of those gene mutations.

00:45:13.510 --> 00:45:18.090 align:middle line:84%
This is the type that works
to detoxify you, the right B9.

00:45:18.090 --> 00:45:21.550 align:middle line:84%
B9 is a big problem, by
the way, because now we

00:45:21.550 --> 00:45:24.850 align:middle line:84%
have evidence that the B9
that's been used in some

00:45:24.850 --> 00:45:27.280 align:middle line:84%
of the supplement industry
is actually-- it's

00:45:27.280 --> 00:45:29.650 align:middle line:90%

00:45:30.550 --> 00:45:33.460 align:middle line:84%
>> Typically, when people
get onto the myceliated B12,

00:45:33.460 --> 00:45:35.440 align:middle line:84%
what ends up happening
is that they go--

00:45:35.440 --> 00:45:37.660 align:middle line:84%
within a minute, they go,
whoa, I'm feeling that.

00:45:37.660 --> 00:45:39.550 align:middle line:84%
The next-- everybody
says this to me.

00:45:39.550 --> 00:45:42.905 align:middle line:84%
They go, I don't think I ever
felt a supplement before.

00:45:42.905 --> 00:45:43.780 align:middle line:90%
I'm not even kidding.

00:45:43.780 --> 00:45:45.370 align:middle line:84%
That's what they-- it's like
in that order, first thing

00:45:45.370 --> 00:45:46.960 align:middle line:84%
they'll say is,
whoa, what's that?

00:45:46.960 --> 00:45:48.585 align:middle line:84%
The next thing is,
I don't think I ever

00:45:48.585 --> 00:45:49.740 align:middle line:90%
felt a supplement before.

00:45:49.740 --> 00:45:53.260 align:middle line:84%
The supplement industry as
is a pharmaceutical industry,

00:45:53.260 --> 00:45:54.190 align:middle line:90%
as we know.

00:45:54.190 --> 00:45:56.107 align:middle line:84%
That's why we've been
on food all these years.

00:45:56.107 --> 00:45:58.600 align:middle line:84%
It's like we don't even
want to go that direction.

00:45:58.600 --> 00:46:03.100 align:middle line:84%
But because of certain key
needs, MTHFR gene mutation,

00:46:03.100 --> 00:46:04.810 align:middle line:84%
the elevated
homocysteine, we know

00:46:04.810 --> 00:46:07.200 align:middle line:84%
that vegans do die of a
particular problem, which

00:46:07.200 --> 00:46:09.010 align:middle line:84%
is elevated
homocysteine, which is

00:46:09.010 --> 00:46:11.770 align:middle line:84%
like a bad drunk in your
system, mutant amino acid

00:46:11.770 --> 00:46:14.860 align:middle line:90%
and that B12 neutralizes it.

00:46:14.860 --> 00:46:18.138 align:middle line:84%
B12 neutralizes
elevated homocysteine.

00:46:18.138 --> 00:46:19.180 align:middle line:90%
So we now have that data.

00:46:19.180 --> 00:46:21.472 align:middle line:84%
We're like, OK, now we're
going to dial in a little bit

00:46:21.472 --> 00:46:23.920 align:middle line:84%
more specific, see if we can
tackle some of these more

00:46:23.920 --> 00:46:25.734 align:middle line:90%
sophisticated problems.

00:46:25.734 --> 00:46:28.698 align:middle line:84%
>> What kind of supplement
snack would you want to take

00:46:28.698 --> 00:46:30.680 align:middle line:90%
to increase endogeneous DMT?

00:46:30.680 --> 00:46:32.770 align:middle line:90%
>> Great question, jeez.

00:46:32.770 --> 00:46:34.900 align:middle line:90%
Well, all DMT is created--

00:46:34.900 --> 00:46:39.100 align:middle line:84%
it's serotonergic group,
which is the serotonin

00:46:39.100 --> 00:46:40.605 align:middle line:90%
group, the tryptophan group.

00:46:40.605 --> 00:46:41.980 align:middle line:84%
So number one
thing if you wanted

00:46:41.980 --> 00:46:45.280 align:middle line:84%
to increase your own production
of DMT is to take a tryptophan.

00:46:45.280 --> 00:46:47.560 align:middle line:84%
And I would take like 3,000
milligrams of tryptophan

00:46:47.560 --> 00:46:48.540 align:middle line:90%
on an empty stomach.

00:46:48.540 --> 00:46:49.340 align:middle line:90%
>> In the dark.

00:46:49.340 --> 00:46:50.470 align:middle line:90%
>> Now, if you do that--

00:46:50.470 --> 00:46:50.860 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:46:50.860 --> 00:46:52.270 align:middle line:84%
If you-- let's say at
the end of the day--

00:46:52.270 --> 00:46:53.260 align:middle line:84%
best time is at
the end of the day.

00:46:53.260 --> 00:46:55.090 align:middle line:84%
You take like 3,000
milligrams of tryptophan

00:46:55.090 --> 00:46:56.507 align:middle line:84%
just by itself on
an empty stomach

00:46:56.507 --> 00:46:59.110 align:middle line:84%
so that nothing's interfere
with the protein synthesis,

00:46:59.110 --> 00:47:00.880 align:middle line:84%
you're going to be
going like, whoa.

00:47:00.880 --> 00:47:04.672 align:middle line:84%
This is like-- dude,
I'm feeling good, man.

00:47:04.672 --> 00:47:05.534 align:middle line:90%
What?

00:47:05.534 --> 00:47:05.965 align:middle line:90%
>> [INAUDIBLE]

00:47:05.965 --> 00:47:06.830 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:47:06.830 --> 00:47:11.080 align:middle line:84%
>> So the reason why there's
so much controversy surrounding

00:47:11.080 --> 00:47:16.010 align:middle line:84%
tryptophan is because
it is a natural anti--

00:47:18.290 --> 00:47:19.290 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, what did you say?

00:47:19.290 --> 00:47:20.090 align:middle line:90%
>> Depression.

00:47:20.090 --> 00:47:21.010 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, you said it.

00:47:21.010 --> 00:47:23.110 align:middle line:10%
See, now I can't say
that because we're

00:47:23.110 --> 00:47:24.910 align:middle line:10%
living in a free country.

00:47:24.910 --> 00:47:26.197 align:middle line:10%
But you could say it.

00:47:26.197 --> 00:47:27.780 align:middle line:10%
>> There's tryptophan
in [INAUDIBLE]..

00:47:27.780 --> 00:47:29.530 align:middle line:84%
>> And there's tryptophan
in [INAUDIBLE]..

00:47:29.530 --> 00:47:30.505 align:middle line:90%
Yep.

00:47:30.505 --> 00:47:32.920 align:middle line:84%
So good question, but
that's your number one.

00:47:32.920 --> 00:47:35.800 align:middle line:84%
TMG is wonderful, by the
way, trimethylglysine.

00:47:35.800 --> 00:47:37.457 align:middle line:84%
That's a really--
that's basically--

00:47:37.457 --> 00:47:39.040 align:middle line:84%
Patrick Flanagan
turned me on to that.

00:47:39.040 --> 00:47:41.020 align:middle line:90%
That's basically betaine.

00:47:41.020 --> 00:47:44.350 align:middle line:84%
And betaine is like the first
claw that hooks into a toxin

00:47:44.350 --> 00:47:46.930 align:middle line:84%
and makes that toxin sticky
so your system can get

00:47:46.930 --> 00:47:48.340 align:middle line:90%
a hold of it and get rid of it.

00:47:48.340 --> 00:47:49.810 align:middle line:84%
So betaine is
something I actually,

00:47:49.810 --> 00:47:52.360 align:middle line:84%
because of Patrick Flanagan,
had been taking on and off

00:47:52.360 --> 00:47:54.070 align:middle line:90%
for many, many years.

00:47:54.070 --> 00:47:56.770 align:middle line:84%
You may have heard of betaine
hydrochloride or things that

00:47:56.770 --> 00:47:58.930 align:middle line:90%
have betaine added onto it.

00:47:58.930 --> 00:48:01.270 align:middle line:84%
I would say with that
right there, number one

00:48:01.270 --> 00:48:04.840 align:middle line:84%
thing to reset your system and
make your serotonergic system

00:48:04.840 --> 00:48:07.640 align:middle line:84%
work better is
fasting, for sure.

00:48:07.640 --> 00:48:08.440 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, just--

00:48:08.440 --> 00:48:09.970 align:middle line:90%
>> How long?

00:48:09.970 --> 00:48:11.585 align:middle line:90%
>> The day-- fast for the day.

00:48:11.585 --> 00:48:13.460 align:middle line:84%
So for example, if you're
going to go-- let's

00:48:13.460 --> 00:48:15.450 align:middle line:84%
say you're going to do ayahuasca
journey or something like that.

00:48:15.450 --> 00:48:17.300 align:middle line:90%
You don't eat during the day--

00:48:17.300 --> 00:48:18.160 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:48:18.160 --> 00:48:18.880 align:middle line:90%
--or whatever.

00:48:18.880 --> 00:48:20.470 align:middle line:84%
Native American church, you
don't eat during the day

00:48:20.470 --> 00:48:22.360 align:middle line:84%
because you want to
have the full effect.

00:48:22.360 --> 00:48:24.310 align:middle line:84%
And it's just better because
it just resets your system.

00:48:24.310 --> 00:48:26.740 align:middle line:84%
Now, when we do a full cleanse,
when we go through the 14 days,

00:48:26.740 --> 00:48:28.115 align:middle line:84%
then we finally
go into the water

00:48:28.115 --> 00:48:30.490 align:middle line:84%
fast for at least
seven days, you're

00:48:30.490 --> 00:48:33.040 align:middle line:84%
completely resetting and
cleaning out all your receptor

00:48:33.040 --> 00:48:34.250 align:middle line:90%
sites.

00:48:34.250 --> 00:48:35.260 align:middle line:84%
And that's part of
how it's working

00:48:35.260 --> 00:48:36.843 align:middle line:84%
because we're taking--
we're doing all

00:48:36.843 --> 00:48:38.770 align:middle line:90%
the enzymes with that cleanse.

00:48:38.770 --> 00:48:40.947 align:middle line:84%
We're doing the charcoal
with that cleanse.

00:48:40.947 --> 00:48:43.030 align:middle line:84%
We're doing the fermented
foods and the probiotics

00:48:43.030 --> 00:48:43.930 align:middle line:90%
with that cleanse.

00:48:43.930 --> 00:48:45.940 align:middle line:84%
We're gradually bringing
the calories down.

00:48:45.940 --> 00:48:48.755 align:middle line:84%
We're definitely doing
coffee enemas and colonics.

00:48:48.755 --> 00:48:49.555 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:48:49.555 --> 00:48:50.830 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:48:50.830 --> 00:48:53.693 align:middle line:84%
>> Because we are
full of you know what.

00:48:53.693 --> 00:48:55.860 align:middle line:84%
All you have to do is look
at any politician and go,

00:48:55.860 --> 00:48:57.370 align:middle line:90%
they are full of--

00:48:57.370 --> 00:48:59.110 align:middle line:90%
you see it, right?

00:48:59.110 --> 00:49:00.340 align:middle line:90%
It's obvious.

00:49:00.340 --> 00:49:02.655 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:49:02.655 --> 00:49:04.510 align:middle line:90%


00:49:04.510 --> 00:49:06.400 align:middle line:84%
One of the reasons
why I like cleansing

00:49:06.400 --> 00:49:07.960 align:middle line:84%
is because it allows
you to go deep

00:49:07.960 --> 00:49:09.670 align:middle line:90%
for a specific period of time.

00:49:09.670 --> 00:49:11.420 align:middle line:84%
There's a whole body
of thought that says,

00:49:11.420 --> 00:49:12.430 align:middle line:84%
oh, you just need
to eat healthy.

00:49:12.430 --> 00:49:13.090 align:middle line:90%
You don't need to cleanse.

00:49:13.090 --> 00:49:14.650 align:middle line:90%
Your body detoxifies itself.

00:49:14.650 --> 00:49:16.910 align:middle line:84%
I've been through
that whole thing.

00:49:16.910 --> 00:49:18.760 align:middle line:84%
You will never get deep
enough to dredge out

00:49:18.760 --> 00:49:20.770 align:middle line:90%
the sludge that way.

00:49:20.770 --> 00:49:22.625 align:middle line:84%
You have to take
a period of time.

00:49:22.625 --> 00:49:23.500 align:middle line:90%
Which period of time?

00:49:23.500 --> 00:49:24.570 align:middle line:90%
When's the time?

00:49:24.570 --> 00:49:26.070 align:middle line:90%
>> 14 days.

00:49:26.070 --> 00:49:27.070 align:middle line:90%
>> 14 days.

00:49:27.070 --> 00:49:28.540 align:middle line:90%
>> And when in the year?

00:49:28.540 --> 00:49:29.740 align:middle line:90%
March 13th through 27th.

00:49:29.740 --> 00:49:31.312 align:middle line:90%
What time of year is that?

00:49:31.312 --> 00:49:33.280 align:middle line:90%
>> Spring.

00:49:33.280 --> 00:49:34.402 align:middle line:90%
>> Spring cleaning.

00:49:34.402 --> 00:49:36.610 align:middle line:84%
And I'm working with my
friend Constantine right now.

00:49:36.610 --> 00:49:38.260 align:middle line:84%
My friend Constantine,
listen to this.

00:49:38.260 --> 00:49:42.040 align:middle line:84%
This guy spent 45
years in academia

00:49:42.040 --> 00:49:44.270 align:middle line:84%
in the old Soviet Union
all the way into current--

00:49:44.270 --> 00:49:46.990 align:middle line:84%
it was Leningrad into
St. Petersburg today.

00:49:46.990 --> 00:49:48.480 align:middle line:90%
And he's still an academic.

00:49:48.480 --> 00:49:50.230 align:middle line:84%
He's the main guy in
the Peruvian mummies,

00:49:50.230 --> 00:49:51.190 align:middle line:90%
if you know that story.

00:49:51.190 --> 00:49:53.120 align:middle line:84%
He's the main
scientist behind it.

00:49:53.120 --> 00:49:53.920 align:middle line:90%
But he's real.

00:49:53.920 --> 00:49:56.230 align:middle line:90%
He's not "scientistimic."

00:49:56.230 --> 00:49:57.340 align:middle line:90%
He's actually scientific.

00:49:57.340 --> 00:49:59.770 align:middle line:84%
So he's spent 30 years
of his career just trying

00:49:59.770 --> 00:50:01.780 align:middle line:84%
to figure out if
he could develop

00:50:01.780 --> 00:50:04.970 align:middle line:84%
a device that could measure
what's going on in this room.

00:50:04.970 --> 00:50:07.390 align:middle line:84%
Or we can put it in
a room and measure

00:50:07.390 --> 00:50:09.990 align:middle line:84%
if a thought came into the room,
if that device could pick it

00:50:09.990 --> 00:50:10.790 align:middle line:90%
up.

00:50:10.790 --> 00:50:13.357 align:middle line:84%
So for example, let's say in
my office in San Francisco--

00:50:13.357 --> 00:50:14.440 align:middle line:90%
I have an office up there.

00:50:14.440 --> 00:50:16.440 align:middle line:84%
I could have that device
sitting in that office.

00:50:16.440 --> 00:50:18.520 align:middle line:84%
Then we could all
together right now go,

00:50:18.520 --> 00:50:21.100 align:middle line:84%
let's send a thought to
that office right now.

00:50:21.100 --> 00:50:23.105 align:middle line:84%
We're going to look at
the Himalayan salt lamp.

00:50:23.105 --> 00:50:24.730 align:middle line:84%
We're going to look
at the bookshelves.

00:50:24.730 --> 00:50:28.120 align:middle line:84%
If that device could pick
it up, he developed that.

00:50:28.120 --> 00:50:30.460 align:middle line:84%
And that device is available,
and it's iPhone enabled.

00:50:30.460 --> 00:50:32.650 align:middle line:84%
And it's going to be out
by the end of this year.

00:50:32.650 --> 00:50:34.810 align:middle line:84%
The next Conscious Life
Expo will have that device

00:50:34.810 --> 00:50:35.810 align:middle line:90%
right there in the back.

00:50:35.810 --> 00:50:36.610 align:middle line:90%
It'll be on.

00:50:36.610 --> 00:50:38.205 align:middle line:84%
And then throughout
the presentation,

00:50:38.205 --> 00:50:39.580 align:middle line:84%
like if I'm doing
a presentation,

00:50:39.580 --> 00:50:41.663 align:middle line:84%
and suddenly I talk about
scientism and people go,

00:50:41.663 --> 00:50:44.299 align:middle line:90%
oh, it'll pick it up.

00:50:44.299 --> 00:50:46.935 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:50:46.935 --> 00:50:48.310 align:middle line:84%
And suddenly, I
go, like, hey, we

00:50:48.310 --> 00:50:49.370 align:middle line:90%
can all have the best day ever.

00:50:49.370 --> 00:50:51.370 align:middle line:84%
This is the best day ever,
best day ever by far.

00:50:51.370 --> 00:50:53.410 align:middle line:84%
Today's the best day
ever of all time.

00:50:53.410 --> 00:50:54.670 align:middle line:90%
That device will pick it up.

00:50:54.670 --> 00:50:56.440 align:middle line:90%
He was showing me Emoto's talks.

00:50:56.440 --> 00:50:58.690 align:middle line:84%
He's like, OK, here's where
we did the water blessing.

00:50:58.690 --> 00:50:59.950 align:middle line:84%
Here's what happened
in the room.

00:50:59.950 --> 00:51:01.090 align:middle line:84%
Here's what happened
at this moment.

00:51:01.090 --> 00:51:01.890 align:middle line:90%
Here's this.

00:51:01.890 --> 00:51:03.430 align:middle line:90%
Here's that.

00:51:03.430 --> 00:51:04.880 align:middle line:84%
This technology
is already there.

00:51:04.880 --> 00:51:05.803 align:middle line:90%
And it's going to be--

00:51:05.803 --> 00:51:06.970 align:middle line:90%
it's already iPhone enabled.

00:51:06.970 --> 00:51:09.053 align:middle line:84%
It's just not available
to the general public yet.

00:51:09.053 --> 00:51:11.080 align:middle line:90%
That's coming.

00:51:11.080 --> 00:51:13.630 align:middle line:10%
It's called Bio-Well.

00:51:13.630 --> 00:51:15.690 align:middle line:10%
Bio-Well, yeah.

00:51:15.690 --> 00:51:18.470 align:middle line:10%
When I first heard about
it, I was like, Bio-Well?

00:51:18.470 --> 00:51:19.270 align:middle line:90%
Like, a well?

00:51:19.270 --> 00:51:21.310 align:middle line:90%
Like, a wishing well?

00:51:21.310 --> 00:51:22.570 align:middle line:90%
That's how I interpreted it.

00:51:22.570 --> 00:51:24.820 align:middle line:84%
So that's how I'm going to
interpret it to the public.

00:51:24.820 --> 00:51:26.860 align:middle line:84%
But it has to do with
wellness obviously.

00:51:26.860 --> 00:51:29.200 align:middle line:90%
But Bio-Well, it's a deep well.

00:51:29.200 --> 00:51:30.160 align:middle line:90%
There's a lot there.

00:51:30.160 --> 00:51:33.532 align:middle line:90%
It's like water, right, deep.

00:51:33.532 --> 00:51:34.490 align:middle line:90%
We covered quite a bit.

00:51:34.490 --> 00:51:35.615 align:middle line:90%
Let me review real quickly.

00:51:35.615 --> 00:51:37.400 align:middle line:84%
Then we'll do some
questions and answers.

00:51:37.400 --> 00:51:38.410 align:middle line:90%
One is we get up in the morning.

00:51:38.410 --> 00:51:39.700 align:middle line:84%
First thing we do
is we drink water,

00:51:39.700 --> 00:51:42.200 align:middle line:84%
best water we got, a little bit
of sea salt for electrolytes

00:51:42.200 --> 00:51:43.030 align:middle line:90%
so we have some--

00:51:43.030 --> 00:51:44.440 align:middle line:84%
I'm telling you, you're
going to find out

00:51:44.440 --> 00:51:46.982 align:middle line:84%
very quickly like, whoa, I don't
need to drink as much water.

00:51:46.982 --> 00:51:48.310 align:middle line:90%
Whoa, I'm more hydrated.

00:51:48.310 --> 00:51:49.727 align:middle line:84%
You're going to
find out the truth

00:51:49.727 --> 00:51:51.200 align:middle line:90%
of the electricity of salt.

00:51:51.200 --> 00:51:52.390 align:middle line:84%
Next thing I want to
do is right with that

00:51:52.390 --> 00:51:54.310 align:middle line:84%
maybe take one capsule
of activated charcoal.

00:51:54.310 --> 00:51:56.350 align:middle line:90%
Don't get too crazy.

00:51:56.350 --> 00:51:58.870 align:middle line:84%
People suddenly go,
hey, this guy said five.

00:51:58.870 --> 00:51:59.950 align:middle line:90%
OK, five.

00:51:59.950 --> 00:52:01.734 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:52:01.734 --> 00:52:03.878 align:middle line:90%
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:52:03.878 --> 00:52:05.170 align:middle line:90%
>> I did seven last night, man.

00:52:05.170 --> 00:52:06.462 align:middle line:90%
That saved me from [INAUDIBLE].

00:52:06.462 --> 00:52:08.930 align:middle line:84%
I'm telling you, saved
my butt so hardcore.

00:52:08.930 --> 00:52:09.730 align:middle line:90%
I woke up.

00:52:09.730 --> 00:52:11.105 align:middle line:84%
Everything was
fine this morning.

00:52:11.105 --> 00:52:13.884 align:middle line:90%
Everything came out fine.

00:52:13.884 --> 00:52:14.810 align:middle line:90%
>> [INAUDIBLE]

00:52:14.810 --> 00:52:16.167 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, I'm used to it, right?

00:52:16.167 --> 00:52:17.500 align:middle line:90%
So that's why we start with one.

00:52:17.500 --> 00:52:18.100 align:middle line:90%
I'm used to it.

00:52:18.100 --> 00:52:19.810 align:middle line:84%
So gradually you're
going to find out

00:52:19.810 --> 00:52:21.595 align:middle line:90%
that if you ever go out--

00:52:21.595 --> 00:52:22.720 align:middle line:90%
I was-- we're doing a fast.

00:52:22.720 --> 00:52:26.357 align:middle line:84%
This was the fast, I think,
a year and a half ago.

00:52:26.357 --> 00:52:27.940 align:middle line:84%
And you know when
you get into a water

00:52:27.940 --> 00:52:29.620 align:middle line:84%
fast, when you finally get
that far into a cleanse,

00:52:29.620 --> 00:52:32.078 align:middle line:84%
you like going out with your
friends and watching them eat.

00:52:32.078 --> 00:52:34.420 align:middle line:84%
It's just amazing, especially
when you're like four days

00:52:34.420 --> 00:52:35.150 align:middle line:90%
into it or something.

00:52:35.150 --> 00:52:36.740 align:middle line:84%
And you're like, these
people are going to eat.

00:52:36.740 --> 00:52:37.220 align:middle line:90%
Let's go.

00:52:37.220 --> 00:52:38.900 align:middle line:84%
We're going to go
to dinner with them.

00:52:38.900 --> 00:52:40.920 align:middle line:90%
And so our good friend Ethan--

00:52:40.920 --> 00:52:41.800 align:middle line:90%
you know Ethan.

00:52:41.800 --> 00:52:44.230 align:middle line:84%
I met Ethan on the side of
the road in Maui 25 years ago.

00:52:44.230 --> 00:52:45.830 align:middle line:84%
He's one of those guys
who was cutting coconuts.

00:52:45.830 --> 00:52:47.010 align:middle line:90%
And now he lives in my house.

00:52:47.010 --> 00:52:48.177 align:middle line:90%
He's one of my best friends.

00:52:48.177 --> 00:52:49.407 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:52:49.407 --> 00:52:51.240 align:middle line:84%
And Ethan was like--
he doesn't-- he's not--

00:52:51.240 --> 00:52:52.240 align:middle line:90%
he's mostly vegetarian.

00:52:52.240 --> 00:52:53.710 align:middle line:84%
But every now and then
he'll eat fish or something.

00:52:53.710 --> 00:52:55.870 align:middle line:84%
So he's like, I'm going to eat
fish at this dinner, right?

00:52:55.870 --> 00:52:56.900 align:middle line:90%
So he has this fish.

00:52:56.900 --> 00:52:59.440 align:middle line:84%
I'm watching this going,
whoa, this is a trip.

00:52:59.440 --> 00:53:00.460 align:middle line:90%
He eats this fish.

00:53:00.460 --> 00:53:02.510 align:middle line:90%
And he didn't feel well.

00:53:02.510 --> 00:53:04.990 align:middle line:84%
So I was like, OK,
dude, charcoal, watch.

00:53:04.990 --> 00:53:06.390 align:middle line:84%
Because just like
everybody else,

00:53:06.390 --> 00:53:07.870 align:middle line:90%
there's stubborn behavior.

00:53:07.870 --> 00:53:09.490 align:middle line:90%
I was like, charcoal.

00:53:09.490 --> 00:53:10.310 align:middle line:90%
I don't know.

00:53:10.310 --> 00:53:10.915 align:middle line:90%
I'm not ready.

00:53:10.915 --> 00:53:11.830 align:middle line:90%
I'm don't want to.

00:53:11.830 --> 00:53:12.760 align:middle line:90%
Ah, it doesn't work.

00:53:12.760 --> 00:53:15.640 align:middle line:84%
Ah, I don't think so, you know,
those little things that go on.

00:53:15.640 --> 00:53:19.360 align:middle line:84%
And so finally I was
like, dude, here, take it.

00:53:19.360 --> 00:53:22.330 align:middle line:84%
An hour later he's like,
bro, that was like--

00:53:22.330 --> 00:53:23.750 align:middle line:84%
that's like better
than an enzyme.

00:53:23.750 --> 00:53:24.702 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:53:24.702 --> 00:53:25.055 align:middle line:90%


00:53:25.055 --> 00:53:25.930 align:middle line:90%
I'm not even kidding.

00:53:25.930 --> 00:53:26.780 align:middle line:90%
You'll find out.

00:53:26.780 --> 00:53:28.330 align:middle line:84%
You're going to
find out the truth.

00:53:28.330 --> 00:53:29.980 align:middle line:84%
You're going to
find out the truth.

00:53:29.980 --> 00:53:31.150 align:middle line:84%
I was with a friend
the other day,

00:53:31.150 --> 00:53:32.275 align:middle line:90%
and he said the same thing.

00:53:32.275 --> 00:53:35.860 align:middle line:84%
He's like, any time any trouble,
anything starts up, he just--

00:53:35.860 --> 00:53:39.280 align:middle line:84%
now he knows to take
the charcoal, right?

00:53:39.280 --> 00:53:42.040 align:middle line:84%
Any little digestive
thing starts up, charcoal.

00:53:42.040 --> 00:53:43.372 align:middle line:90%
Stomach upset, charcoal.

00:53:43.372 --> 00:53:45.830 align:middle line:84%
Feeling like a little flu,
fever thing coming on, charcoal.

00:53:45.830 --> 00:53:48.028 align:middle line:84%
Just start first
line of defense.

00:53:48.028 --> 00:53:49.570 align:middle line:84%
So I was like, where
are you enzymes?

00:53:49.570 --> 00:53:50.470 align:middle line:84%
He's like, oh, we
don't have enzymes.

00:53:50.470 --> 00:53:51.880 align:middle line:90%
But we've got charcoal.

00:53:51.880 --> 00:53:54.880 align:middle line:90%
What if switch around?

00:53:54.880 --> 00:53:56.120 align:middle line:90%
What-- yeah.

00:53:56.120 --> 00:53:57.550 align:middle line:84%
Take charcoal
before the enzymes.

00:53:57.550 --> 00:53:58.350 align:middle line:90%
Take--

00:53:58.350 --> 00:53:59.270 align:middle line:90%
>> [INAUDIBLE]

00:53:59.270 --> 00:54:00.070 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh.

00:54:00.070 --> 00:54:01.000 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:54:01.000 --> 00:54:03.125 align:middle line:84%
Well, the highest dose is
going to depend on what's

00:54:03.125 --> 00:54:04.480 align:middle line:90%
going to constipate you.

00:54:04.480 --> 00:54:08.380 align:middle line:84%
But the highest dose I've ever
done, 12,500 milligrams at

00:54:08.380 --> 00:54:09.460 align:middle line:90%
once--

00:54:09.460 --> 00:54:13.030 align:middle line:84%
12,500 milligrams of activated
charcoal at one time.

00:54:13.030 --> 00:54:15.490 align:middle line:84%
Now, I did that at a
longevity conference

00:54:15.490 --> 00:54:19.060 align:middle line:84%
because I'd been up
all day for four days.

00:54:19.060 --> 00:54:21.580 align:middle line:84%
And now I'm down
to the last day.

00:54:21.580 --> 00:54:23.830 align:middle line:84%
And they're like, you have
to get the volunteers up

00:54:23.830 --> 00:54:25.750 align:middle line:90%
and going at 7:00 AM.

00:54:25.750 --> 00:54:27.190 align:middle line:90%
This is like the Sunday.

00:54:27.190 --> 00:54:28.430 align:middle line:90%
I'm going, I'm-- I can't.

00:54:28.430 --> 00:54:29.230 align:middle line:90%
6:00 AM?

00:54:29.230 --> 00:54:31.840 align:middle line:84%
I'm still trying
to get to sleep.

00:54:31.840 --> 00:54:33.040 align:middle line:90%
So I slept an hour.

00:54:33.040 --> 00:54:34.190 align:middle line:90%
I got up.

00:54:34.190 --> 00:54:36.550 align:middle line:84%
And there I had my
Castle Rock water.

00:54:36.550 --> 00:54:39.790 align:middle line:84%
And I had 12,500 milligrams
of activated charcoal,

00:54:39.790 --> 00:54:41.710 align:middle line:90%
and I downed it.

00:54:41.710 --> 00:54:47.230 align:middle line:10%
And within 40 minutes, I'm
there with the volunteers,

00:54:47.230 --> 00:54:49.920 align:middle line:10%
perfectly fine.

00:54:49.920 --> 00:54:51.690 align:middle line:90%
Energy's great.

00:54:51.690 --> 00:54:53.070 align:middle line:90%
I didn't need to sleep.

00:54:53.070 --> 00:54:54.660 align:middle line:84%
I was completely
alert and awake.

00:54:54.660 --> 00:54:56.820 align:middle line:84%
You're going to
find out the truth.

00:54:56.820 --> 00:54:59.730 align:middle line:10%
When you wake up in the
morning, when you urinate out

00:54:59.730 --> 00:55:01.950 align:middle line:10%
your neurotransmitters--
here's one for you

00:55:01.950 --> 00:55:04.650 align:middle line:10%
on the serotonergic system.

00:55:04.650 --> 00:55:06.882 align:middle line:90%
Serotonin has two sides, right?

00:55:06.882 --> 00:55:08.340 align:middle line:84%
There's a side
that's like, oh, hi,

00:55:08.340 --> 00:55:09.910 align:middle line:90%
bright, happy, best day ever.

00:55:09.910 --> 00:55:11.910 align:middle line:84%
There's also the side
that's lethargic and like,

00:55:11.910 --> 00:55:15.630 align:middle line:84%
[MUMBLING] got to
go back to sleep.

00:55:15.630 --> 00:55:19.030 align:middle line:84%
That other side is
the used-up serotonin.

00:55:19.030 --> 00:55:21.510 align:middle line:84%
And that used-up serotonin
has to be flushed out

00:55:21.510 --> 00:55:24.372 align:middle line:84%
of your system in the morning
or you will stay lethargic.

00:55:24.372 --> 00:55:25.668 align:middle line:90%
>> [INAUDIBLE]

00:55:25.668 --> 00:55:26.700 align:middle line:90%
>> Uh-huh.

00:55:26.700 --> 00:55:27.510 align:middle line:90%
Watch this one.

00:55:27.510 --> 00:55:29.640 align:middle line:84%
So as soon as you hit the
charcoal in the morning

00:55:29.640 --> 00:55:32.790 align:middle line:84%
and it sucks up that serotonin,
you wake up, and you are alert,

00:55:32.790 --> 00:55:35.640 align:middle line:90%
and you are aware.

00:55:35.640 --> 00:55:39.112 align:middle line:84%
Guess what time I went
to bed last night?

00:55:39.112 --> 00:55:40.110 align:middle line:90%
>> 4:30?

00:55:40.110 --> 00:55:42.260 align:middle line:90%
>> 4:30 in the morning.

00:55:42.260 --> 00:55:43.220 align:middle line:90%
We got back here.

00:55:43.220 --> 00:55:43.910 align:middle line:90%
What time did we get back here?

00:55:43.910 --> 00:55:44.470 align:middle line:90%
4:30 in the morning.

00:55:44.470 --> 00:55:45.270 align:middle line:90%
>> 4:30.

00:55:45.270 --> 00:55:47.420 align:middle line:90%
>> 4:30 in the morning.

00:55:47.420 --> 00:55:49.920 align:middle line:84%
4:30 in the morning, because
this is the Conscious Life

00:55:49.920 --> 00:55:50.720 align:middle line:90%
Expo.

00:55:50.720 --> 00:55:51.970 align:middle line:90%
We're going berserk over here.

00:55:51.970 --> 00:55:53.060 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:55:53.060 --> 00:55:54.200 align:middle line:90%
We've got to get it all.

00:55:54.200 --> 00:55:55.367 align:middle line:90%
>> What time did you get up?

00:55:55.367 --> 00:55:58.220 align:middle line:84%
>> Oh, jeez, well, first time
I got up was 8:00, right?

00:55:58.220 --> 00:55:59.900 align:middle line:84%
And I was like, OK, I got to
get this-- my head on straight

00:55:59.900 --> 00:56:00.540 align:middle line:90%
because I got to get up.

00:56:00.540 --> 00:56:02.660 align:middle line:84%
And then these guys are like
shuffling stuff in and out

00:56:02.660 --> 00:56:02.990 align:middle line:90%
of the room.

00:56:02.990 --> 00:56:04.760 align:middle line:84%
And I was like, OK, I'm going
to go back and just rest

00:56:04.760 --> 00:56:06.720 align:middle line:84%
because I've got a
presentation today.

00:56:06.720 --> 00:56:08.420 align:middle line:84%
But all I got to do
if it really is--

00:56:08.420 --> 00:56:11.180 align:middle line:84%
if the screws are put to me,
all I gotta do is take it just

00:56:11.180 --> 00:56:13.040 align:middle line:84%
a ton of charcoal and
drink a ton of water,

00:56:13.040 --> 00:56:16.272 align:middle line:84%
and it will neutralize
all the neurotransmitters

00:56:16.272 --> 00:56:18.230 align:middle line:84%
and all the stuff that's
floating around that's

00:56:18.230 --> 00:56:21.080 align:middle line:84%
making me tired and drowsy,
including the toxins

00:56:21.080 --> 00:56:23.270 align:middle line:90%
and processing the toxins.

00:56:23.270 --> 00:56:25.200 align:middle line:90%
This is such a big deal.

00:56:25.200 --> 00:56:26.720 align:middle line:90%
It's metabolic waste.

00:56:26.720 --> 00:56:31.610 align:middle line:84%
What gets us is metabolic waste,
food, air, and water toxins,

00:56:31.610 --> 00:56:36.675 align:middle line:84%
and then on top of
that, industrial wastes.

00:56:36.675 --> 00:56:38.300 align:middle line:84%
So you put those
three things together,

00:56:38.300 --> 00:56:39.980 align:middle line:84%
what's going to neutralize
that better than anything?

00:56:39.980 --> 00:56:40.610 align:middle line:90%
I'm into clay.

00:56:40.610 --> 00:56:41.330 align:middle line:90%
I like clay.

00:56:41.330 --> 00:56:41.780 align:middle line:90%
I'm into zeolites.

00:56:41.780 --> 00:56:42.638 align:middle line:90%
I like zeolites.

00:56:42.638 --> 00:56:44.180 align:middle line:84%
But you're not going
to compare those

00:56:44.180 --> 00:56:47.450 align:middle line:84%
to the power and history and
the science behind charcoal.

00:56:47.450 --> 00:56:49.758 align:middle line:90%
It's not even a comparison.

00:56:49.758 --> 00:56:51.800 align:middle line:84%
Now, I'm not saying that
you shouldn't have clay.

00:56:51.800 --> 00:56:52.640 align:middle line:90%
You should.

00:56:52.640 --> 00:56:53.780 align:middle line:84%
I'm not saying you
shouldn't have zeolites.

00:56:53.780 --> 00:56:54.780 align:middle line:90%
If you like that, great.

00:56:54.780 --> 00:56:55.970 align:middle line:90%
I do zeolites occasionally.

00:56:55.970 --> 00:56:58.070 align:middle line:84%
But there's nothing
like-- charcoal's a go

00:56:58.070 --> 00:56:59.510 align:middle line:90%
to because it's simple.

00:56:59.510 --> 00:57:00.740 align:middle line:90%
It's easy to understand.

00:57:00.740 --> 00:57:02.280 align:middle line:90%
It has the history behind it.

00:57:02.280 --> 00:57:04.520 align:middle line:84%
And over time, you go,
this stuff is like--

00:57:04.520 --> 00:57:06.270 align:middle line:90%
what's going on?

00:57:06.270 --> 00:57:07.720 align:middle line:90%
What's happening to me?

00:57:07.720 --> 00:57:10.640 align:middle line:84%
Then what it led
me to is all my--

00:57:10.640 --> 00:57:12.920 align:middle line:84%
this last year, we
had 100 sea buckthorns

00:57:12.920 --> 00:57:14.120 align:middle line:90%
that we transplanted.

00:57:14.120 --> 00:57:15.620 align:middle line:84%
I got to the point
where I was like,

00:57:15.620 --> 00:57:17.810 align:middle line:84%
all I have to do is just dig a
hole, throw a bunch of charcoal

00:57:17.810 --> 00:57:20.420 align:middle line:84%
in the hole, throw that sea
buckthorn sod piece in there

00:57:20.420 --> 00:57:22.378 align:middle line:84%
because I was basically
transplanting it from--

00:57:22.378 --> 00:57:25.400 align:middle line:84%
I had a big mother sea buckthorn
that was just pushing out

00:57:25.400 --> 00:57:27.890 align:middle line:84%
so many suckers that I was
just basically chopping

00:57:27.890 --> 00:57:30.435 align:middle line:84%
the sucker off, pulling
out the whole piece of sod,

00:57:30.435 --> 00:57:32.060 align:middle line:84%
right, with the new
plant sprouting out

00:57:32.060 --> 00:57:34.300 align:middle line:84%
and the root, then the
piece that I cut off.

00:57:34.300 --> 00:57:36.650 align:middle line:84%
And I would just dig a hole
over there, dig a hole,

00:57:36.650 --> 00:57:38.570 align:middle line:84%
throw a whole thing a
charcoal in that hole,

00:57:38.570 --> 00:57:40.590 align:middle line:84%
throw that sod
right on top of it.

00:57:40.590 --> 00:57:43.870 align:middle line:90%
97% take rate--

00:57:43.870 --> 00:57:45.530 align:middle line:90%
97%.

00:57:45.530 --> 00:57:49.460 align:middle line:84%
We lost only three
the whole year!

00:57:49.460 --> 00:57:50.480 align:middle line:90%
I've never had that.

00:57:50.480 --> 00:57:51.410 align:middle line:90%
I've been a farmer for years.

00:57:51.410 --> 00:57:52.580 align:middle line:90%
I'm like, what is going on?

00:57:52.580 --> 00:57:54.247 align:middle line:84%
So all of a sudden
I'm like, let me just

00:57:54.247 --> 00:57:56.600 align:middle line:84%
start sprouting stuff
in straight charcoal,

00:57:56.600 --> 00:57:58.280 align:middle line:90%
see what happens.

00:57:58.280 --> 00:58:01.220 align:middle line:84%
It was-- it's astounding
actually, what happens.

00:58:01.220 --> 00:58:03.790 align:middle line:90%
Charcoal-- you know vermiculite?

00:58:03.790 --> 00:58:05.360 align:middle line:90%
You guys are gardeners?

00:58:05.360 --> 00:58:06.950 align:middle line:90%
Vermiculite is a fake charcoal.

00:58:06.950 --> 00:58:08.690 align:middle line:90%
It's a toxic imposter charcoal.

00:58:08.690 --> 00:58:10.400 align:middle line:84%
Basically what
vermiculite is like,

00:58:10.400 --> 00:58:11.930 align:middle line:84%
hey, let's just try to
sell them a product that

00:58:11.930 --> 00:58:14.550 align:middle line:84%
could be like charcoal, but it
wouldn't be as good, of course.

00:58:14.550 --> 00:58:16.092 align:middle line:84%
But we'll just try
to-- because it'll

00:58:16.092 --> 00:58:18.890 align:middle line:84%
hold the space in the soil,
will suck up moisture.

00:58:18.890 --> 00:58:20.220 align:middle line:90%
You don't need pop silica.

00:58:20.220 --> 00:58:21.095 align:middle line:90%
Just put charcoal in.

00:58:21.095 --> 00:58:21.770 align:middle line:90%
It does all that.

00:58:21.770 --> 00:58:22.905 align:middle line:84%
Not only that, it's
negatively charged.

00:58:22.905 --> 00:58:23.705 align:middle line:90%
It's black.

00:58:23.705 --> 00:58:25.605 align:middle line:84%
It will start the
whole ecosystem up.

00:58:25.605 --> 00:58:28.460 align:middle line:84%
>> [INAUDIBLE] controlled
burns for a reason.

00:58:28.460 --> 00:58:29.720 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, my god.

00:58:29.720 --> 00:58:30.860 align:middle line:90%
I'm up in Hardin Hop--

00:58:30.860 --> 00:58:33.340 align:middle line:84%
Harbin Hot Springs
after that whole--

00:58:33.340 --> 00:58:34.837 align:middle line:84%
the big fires,
Harbin Hot Springs.

00:58:34.837 --> 00:58:36.170 align:middle line:90%
You guys saw that happen, right?

00:58:36.170 --> 00:58:37.670 align:middle line:90%
So we finally get back there.

00:58:37.670 --> 00:58:38.893 align:middle line:90%
They've reopened it.

00:58:38.893 --> 00:58:40.310 align:middle line:84%
The girls go into
the hot springs.

00:58:40.310 --> 00:58:41.420 align:middle line:84%
I'm like, forget
the hot springs.

00:58:41.420 --> 00:58:42.770 align:middle line:90%
Let's go into the cold springs.

00:58:42.770 --> 00:58:44.090 align:middle line:90%
Look, what's going on up here?

00:58:44.090 --> 00:58:47.750 align:middle line:84%
The entire whole place is
all charcoaled, all of it.

00:58:47.750 --> 00:58:48.920 align:middle line:90%
The charcoal's in the water.

00:58:48.920 --> 00:58:50.927 align:middle line:84%
There's mushrooms growing
out of the charcoal.

00:58:50.927 --> 00:58:51.760 align:middle line:90%
I'm like, that's it.

00:58:51.760 --> 00:58:52.560 align:middle line:90%
That's for me.

00:58:52.560 --> 00:58:54.982 align:middle line:84%
I want the medicinal mushrooms
that grow out of charcoal.

00:58:54.982 --> 00:58:55.782 align:middle line:90%
>> Mm.

00:58:55.782 --> 00:58:57.030 align:middle line:90%
>> Wow.

00:58:57.030 --> 00:58:58.623 align:middle line:90%
>> You guys getting this now?

00:58:58.623 --> 00:59:00.290 align:middle line:84%
When I get to the big
island of Hawaii--

00:59:00.290 --> 00:59:01.250 align:middle line:90%
this is just where my head goes.

00:59:01.250 --> 00:59:02.720 align:middle line:84%
I just want you guys
to think this through.

00:59:02.720 --> 00:59:04.670 align:middle line:84%
This is like-- this
is what science really

00:59:04.670 --> 00:59:06.030 align:middle line:90%
is, about thinking differently.

00:59:06.030 --> 00:59:08.720 align:middle line:84%
It's not about scientism
and about this other--

00:59:08.720 --> 00:59:12.680 align:middle line:84%
another-- the next "you can't
think that way," because that's

00:59:12.680 --> 00:59:13.932 align:middle line:90%
exactly what scientism is.

00:59:13.932 --> 00:59:15.140 align:middle line:90%
You can't think that thought.

00:59:15.140 --> 00:59:16.160 align:middle line:90%
You can't say that.

00:59:16.160 --> 00:59:17.250 align:middle line:90%
How dare you.

00:59:17.250 --> 00:59:19.790 align:middle line:84%
It's like, no, we're going
to think different thoughts.

00:59:19.790 --> 00:59:20.780 align:middle line:90%
Sorry.

00:59:20.780 --> 00:59:23.540 align:middle line:84%
When I go to the big island,
there's a whole forest there.

00:59:23.540 --> 00:59:25.280 align:middle line:90%
It's been mowed down by lava.

00:59:25.280 --> 00:59:26.420 align:middle line:90%
It's been charcoaled.

00:59:26.420 --> 00:59:29.000 align:middle line:84%
Those ohia trees that are
100 years old, 200 years old,

00:59:29.000 --> 00:59:30.590 align:middle line:84%
300 years old, 500
years old have all

00:59:30.590 --> 00:59:32.630 align:middle line:90%
been charcoaled by lava.

00:59:32.630 --> 00:59:36.770 align:middle line:84%
Now they're all growing
medicinal mushrooms.

00:59:36.770 --> 00:59:38.160 align:middle line:90%
You see where this goes?

00:59:38.160 --> 00:59:44.180 align:middle line:84%
So I'm out there on that
laboratory of lava, wood, sky,

00:59:44.180 --> 00:59:49.010 align:middle line:84%
stars, sun, and moon, picking
medicinal mushrooms off

00:59:49.010 --> 00:59:52.910 align:middle line:84%
of charcoaled ohia
trees on the Big Island.

00:59:52.910 --> 00:59:54.830 align:middle line:84%
And we take-- then you
get big bags of that.

00:59:54.830 --> 00:59:56.900 align:middle line:84%
And that's in our tea every
day that we're making that.

00:59:56.900 --> 00:59:57.700 align:middle line:90%
>> Wow.

00:59:57.700 --> 00:59:59.300 align:middle line:90%
>> That's the thinking, right?

00:59:59.300 --> 01:00:00.550 align:middle line:84%
You want to get that
to the next level.

01:00:00.550 --> 01:00:01.330 align:middle line:90%
That's the thinking.

01:00:01.330 --> 01:00:02.705 align:middle line:84%
It starts out,
you've got to know

01:00:02.705 --> 01:00:04.370 align:middle line:90%
first this one little thing.

01:00:04.370 --> 01:00:05.775 align:middle line:90%
I just got to say this.

01:00:05.775 --> 01:00:07.650 align:middle line:84%
I've been on Paul Stamets
for this for years.

01:00:07.650 --> 01:00:09.150 align:middle line:84%
It's just tell the
people the truth,

01:00:09.150 --> 01:00:13.728 align:middle line:84%
which is medicinal mushrooms are
mushrooms that grow from trees.

01:00:13.728 --> 01:00:16.020 align:middle line:84%
Medicinal mushrooms are
mushrooms that grow from trees.

01:00:16.020 --> 01:00:19.400 align:middle line:84%
Let me say it again
just so we got this.

01:00:19.400 --> 01:00:22.040 align:middle line:84%
Medicinal mushrooms are
mushrooms that grow from trees.

01:00:22.040 --> 01:00:23.760 align:middle line:84%
Where do medicinal
mushrooms grow from?

01:00:23.760 --> 01:00:24.560 align:middle line:90%
>> Trees.

01:00:24.560 --> 01:00:25.810 align:middle line:90%
>> Do they grow on the ground?

01:00:25.810 --> 01:00:26.610 align:middle line:90%
>> No.

01:00:26.610 --> 01:00:27.770 align:middle line:90%
>> For the most part, no.

01:00:27.770 --> 01:00:28.310 align:middle line:90%
There are some.

01:00:28.310 --> 01:00:30.000 align:middle line:84%
But you don't need--
don't ever go there.

01:00:30.000 --> 01:00:30.560 align:middle line:90%
You don't need to go there.

01:00:30.560 --> 01:00:33.227 align:middle line:84%
You're not going to be an expert
mushroom hunter and taxonomist,

01:00:33.227 --> 01:00:35.030 align:middle line:84%
I would assume,
right, most of us.

01:00:35.030 --> 01:00:38.510 align:middle line:90%
But you will be on a hike.

01:00:38.510 --> 01:00:42.100 align:middle line:84%
You will be out in the forest
one day and be like, wait,

01:00:42.100 --> 01:00:44.270 align:middle line:90%
it's coming out of a tree!

01:00:44.270 --> 01:00:47.240 align:middle line:84%
That dude said a mushroom
comes out of a tree is good.

01:00:47.240 --> 01:00:48.473 align:middle line:90%
Let's pick it.

01:00:48.473 --> 01:00:49.640 align:middle line:90%
Then you get your phone out.

01:00:49.640 --> 01:00:52.910 align:middle line:84%
And you go, maybe we can
figure out which one this is.

01:00:52.910 --> 01:00:53.710 align:middle line:90%
You'll do that.

01:00:53.710 --> 01:00:55.630 align:middle line:84%
I can guarantee you
you're going to do that.

01:00:55.630 --> 01:00:57.640 align:middle line:84%
And then what'll eventually
happen, you'll figure out one,

01:00:57.640 --> 01:00:59.223 align:middle line:84%
and you'll go, jeez,
maybe we should--

01:00:59.223 --> 01:01:00.432 align:middle line:90%
he said just throw it in tea.

01:01:00.432 --> 01:01:02.520 align:middle line:84%
OK, let's just throw it
in tea, see what happens.

01:01:02.520 --> 01:01:05.730 align:middle line:84%
Or he said, dry it and
sun, just dry it in the sun

01:01:05.730 --> 01:01:08.338 align:middle line:84%
till it's crispy and
then throw it in tea.

01:01:08.338 --> 01:01:09.880 align:middle line:84%
And you're getting
your own medicine,

01:01:09.880 --> 01:01:10.960 align:middle line:90%
your own local medicine.

01:01:10.960 --> 01:01:13.060 align:middle line:84%
That's my goal for you
always in all my work

01:01:13.060 --> 01:01:15.490 align:middle line:84%
is always to try to get you
so you are your own doctor.

01:01:15.490 --> 01:01:18.280 align:middle line:84%
You get all the way to the
end of the road yourself.

01:01:18.280 --> 01:01:20.080 align:middle line:84%
And you can figure
out your own medicine.

01:01:20.080 --> 01:01:22.720 align:middle line:84%
But this thing about trees,
remember that movie "Avatar,"

01:01:22.720 --> 01:01:24.730 align:middle line:84%
it's just a bunch
of stupid trees.

01:01:24.730 --> 01:01:27.010 align:middle line:84%
Is it just a bunch
of stupid trees?

01:01:27.010 --> 01:01:28.210 align:middle line:90%
>> No!

01:01:28.210 --> 01:01:29.560 align:middle line:90%
>> It really isn't.

01:01:29.560 --> 01:01:33.940 align:middle line:84%
Every tree that comes down is a
massive tragedy for all of us.

01:01:33.940 --> 01:01:36.340 align:middle line:84%
And eventually, if the
tree falls in the forest--

01:01:36.340 --> 01:01:37.390 align:middle line:90%
remember that?

01:01:37.390 --> 01:01:39.610 align:middle line:84%
If a tree falls in the
forest, sooner or later

01:01:39.610 --> 01:01:40.774 align:middle line:90%
we'll all hear it.

01:01:40.774 --> 01:01:41.574 align:middle line:90%
>> Mm.

01:01:41.574 --> 01:01:44.540 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

01:01:44.540 --> 01:01:47.300 align:middle line:84%
>> We're all going to
hear it eventually.

01:01:47.300 --> 01:01:49.790 align:middle line:84%
And we're hearing about
it now, the felling

01:01:49.790 --> 01:01:53.147 align:middle line:84%
of our great forests,
our old-growth forests.

01:01:53.147 --> 01:01:55.730 align:middle line:84%
We know now the research on the
medicinal mushrooms coming out

01:01:55.730 --> 01:01:57.117 align:middle line:90%
of old-growth forests.

01:01:57.117 --> 01:01:57.950 align:middle line:90%
I've had a mushroom.

01:01:57.950 --> 01:01:59.367 align:middle line:84%
Ron Teeguarden
gave me a mushroom.

01:01:59.367 --> 01:02:01.320 align:middle line:90%
It was a 400-year-old mushroom.

01:02:01.320 --> 01:02:03.900 align:middle line:90%
>> Wow!

01:02:03.900 --> 01:02:06.860 align:middle line:84%
>> 400 years this thing had
bean grown on a mulberry tree,

01:02:06.860 --> 01:02:10.295 align:middle line:90%
ancient mulberry tree.

01:02:10.295 --> 01:02:12.350 align:middle line:90%
I have that in my office.

01:02:12.350 --> 01:02:14.450 align:middle line:90%
It's a big mass like this.

01:02:14.450 --> 01:02:16.067 align:middle line:90%
It's amazing.

01:02:16.067 --> 01:02:17.150 align:middle line:90%
This is what we're losing.

01:02:17.150 --> 01:02:17.870 align:middle line:90%
We don't even know.

01:02:17.870 --> 01:02:19.070 align:middle line:84%
We don't know what
we don't know.

01:02:19.070 --> 01:02:19.918 align:middle line:90%
Question?

01:02:19.918 --> 01:02:23.124 align:middle line:90%
>> What [INAUDIBLE]

01:02:23.124 --> 01:02:24.830 align:middle line:90%


01:02:24.830 --> 01:02:26.540 align:middle line:84%
>> I have a whole--
in my book, "Chaga,

01:02:26.540 --> 01:02:27.530 align:middle line:84%
King of the
Medicinal Mushrooms,"

01:02:27.530 --> 01:02:29.910 align:middle line:84%
I have that all laid out with
one thing missing in there,

01:02:29.910 --> 01:02:32.270 align:middle line:84%
which is the charcoal piece
because I wrote that book about

01:02:32.270 --> 01:02:33.890 align:middle line:84%
eight years ago, and the
charcoal piece came in about

01:02:33.890 --> 01:02:34.950 align:middle line:90%
five years ago.

01:02:34.950 --> 01:02:35.750 align:middle line:90%
It's all laid out.

01:02:35.750 --> 01:02:36.625 align:middle line:90%
So that's a big deal.

01:02:36.625 --> 01:02:39.470 align:middle line:84%
Now, for example
I, had a woman, who

01:02:39.470 --> 01:02:43.650 align:middle line:84%
she was days to live,
pancreatic cancer.

01:02:43.650 --> 01:02:45.518 align:middle line:90%
So this woman came to me.

01:02:45.518 --> 01:02:47.060 align:middle line:84%
She had four-stage
pancreatic cancer.

01:02:47.060 --> 01:02:48.200 align:middle line:84%
They were going to
do a Wilson surgery

01:02:48.200 --> 01:02:50.533 align:middle line:84%
on her, which no one's ever
lived longer than five years

01:02:50.533 --> 01:02:52.520 align:middle line:90%
on that surgery.

01:02:52.520 --> 01:02:56.750 align:middle line:84%
I sent her to Dr. Gonzales
before he was heart attacked.

01:02:56.750 --> 01:02:58.340 align:middle line:90%
And he-- they rejected her.

01:02:58.340 --> 01:02:59.450 align:middle line:90%
They're like, too late.

01:02:59.450 --> 01:03:00.682 align:middle line:90%
You're not going to make it.

01:03:00.682 --> 01:03:01.640 align:middle line:90%
They rejected her case.

01:03:01.640 --> 01:03:04.640 align:middle line:84%
I was like, is she
willing to do anything

01:03:04.640 --> 01:03:05.868 align:middle line:90%
that we lay out for her?

01:03:05.868 --> 01:03:07.160 align:middle line:90%
She's like, she'll do anything.

01:03:07.160 --> 01:03:10.500 align:middle line:84%
So we laid our protocol for
her, and she's still alive.

01:03:10.500 --> 01:03:11.300 align:middle line:90%
She's still alive.

01:03:11.300 --> 01:03:13.040 align:middle line:84%
That was like six
or seven years ago.

01:03:13.040 --> 01:03:15.110 align:middle line:90%
She went back to work.

01:03:15.110 --> 01:03:17.120 align:middle line:90%
Days to live.

01:03:17.120 --> 01:03:19.355 align:middle line:84%
Now you know how
deadly that cancer is.

01:03:19.355 --> 01:03:20.730 align:middle line:84%
I'm not saying
that in every case

01:03:20.730 --> 01:03:21.950 align:middle line:84%
that someone's
going to survive it.

01:03:21.950 --> 01:03:23.660 align:middle line:84%
But in her case,
she did survive it.

01:03:23.660 --> 01:03:25.118 align:middle line:84%
And she survived
it because she did

01:03:25.118 --> 01:03:29.610 align:middle line:84%
the right protocol,
physical, mental, emotional,

01:03:29.610 --> 01:03:32.420 align:middle line:90%
and spiritual.

01:03:32.420 --> 01:03:36.200 align:middle line:84%
This just physical, just
materialism is an abomination.

01:03:36.200 --> 01:03:37.000 align:middle line:90%
It's scientism.

01:03:37.000 --> 01:03:38.490 align:middle line:90%
It's an ahrimanic deception.

01:03:38.490 --> 01:03:39.907 align:middle line:84%
Somebody had a
question here, yes?

01:03:39.907 --> 01:03:40.730 align:middle line:90%
>> What about ALS?

01:03:40.730 --> 01:03:41.530 align:middle line:90%
>> What about ALS?

01:03:41.530 --> 01:03:47.400 align:middle line:84%
I have never taken an ALS case
all the way back to normal.

01:03:47.400 --> 01:03:51.260 align:middle line:84%
I have seen with ALS that
stem cell treatments can stop

01:03:51.260 --> 01:03:53.510 align:middle line:90%
or slow the progression of it.

01:03:53.510 --> 01:03:56.510 align:middle line:84%
But the guys who do the stem
cell treatments, my friends,

01:03:56.510 --> 01:03:58.340 align:middle line:84%
they won't do it out
of ethics because they

01:03:58.340 --> 01:03:59.690 align:middle line:90%
know it won't cure the person.

01:03:59.690 --> 01:04:01.550 align:middle line:90%
It will only slow it down.

01:04:01.550 --> 01:04:04.400 align:middle line:84%
And so they kind of--
they won't treat that case

01:04:04.400 --> 01:04:07.315 align:middle line:84%
because they don't want to
give the person false hope.

01:04:07.315 --> 01:04:09.740 align:middle line:90%
>> How about charcoal?

01:04:09.740 --> 01:04:12.230 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, I'd--
there's always a way.

01:04:12.230 --> 01:04:14.180 align:middle line:84%
Somebody's going to
figure out the way.

01:04:14.180 --> 01:04:18.430 align:middle line:10%
And so my recommendation, of
course, for all steps of--

01:04:18.430 --> 01:04:20.550 align:middle line:10%
let me get this back up here.

01:04:20.550 --> 01:04:21.470 align:middle line:90%
We'll do this one.

01:04:21.470 --> 01:04:25.160 align:middle line:84%
For all steps of rejuvenation
and increasing vital life

01:04:25.160 --> 01:04:28.700 align:middle line:90%
force, this one's a big one.

01:04:28.700 --> 01:04:29.660 align:middle line:90%
This is a big one.

01:04:29.660 --> 01:04:31.660 align:middle line:84%
This is, by the way,
that's Frolkis right there.

01:04:31.660 --> 01:04:35.500 align:middle line:84%
That's his research on rats
and extending their lifespan

01:04:35.500 --> 01:04:37.705 align:middle line:90%
with activated charcoal.

01:04:37.705 --> 01:04:40.900 align:middle line:90%


01:04:40.900 --> 01:04:43.790 align:middle line:84%
>> Does it help at all
with the 5G coming in?

01:04:43.790 --> 01:04:46.230 align:middle line:84%
>> The best thing you got
against 5G is charcoal and coal

01:04:46.230 --> 01:04:47.030 align:middle line:90%
and carbon.

01:04:47.030 --> 01:04:50.450 align:middle line:10%
These are the carbon molecules,
the C60 and the fullerenes.

01:04:50.450 --> 01:04:51.710 align:middle line:90%
You can see the C60.

01:04:51.710 --> 01:04:53.010 align:middle line:90%
The C60's interesting.

01:04:53.010 --> 01:04:53.960 align:middle line:90%
It's a soccer ball.

01:04:53.960 --> 01:04:56.585 align:middle line:10%
And the reason why it's a soccer
ball is because a soccer ball,

01:04:56.585 --> 01:04:58.525 align:middle line:10%
you can kick it,
and it won't rip.

01:04:58.525 --> 01:04:59.900 align:middle line:10%
That's why a soccer
ball ended up

01:04:59.900 --> 01:05:03.170 align:middle line:10%
being 20 hexagons
and 12 pentagons.

01:05:03.170 --> 01:05:06.005 align:middle line:84%
The C70 is a rugby
ball, interestingly.

01:05:06.005 --> 01:05:08.180 align:middle line:84%
And those are the
two dominant ones

01:05:08.180 --> 01:05:10.525 align:middle line:84%
when you have the
production of C60 and C70.

01:05:10.525 --> 01:05:11.900 align:middle line:84%
We talked about
that way earlier.

01:05:11.900 --> 01:05:14.360 align:middle line:84%
That's always present in
all activated charcoal,

01:05:14.360 --> 01:05:15.960 align:middle line:84%
but a very small
percentage of it.

01:05:15.960 --> 01:05:16.860 align:middle line:90%
But it's there.

01:05:16.860 --> 01:05:17.840 align:middle line:90%
>> Which one's best?

01:05:17.840 --> 01:05:20.132 align:middle line:84%
>> And so which one's best
is C60 because it's the most

01:05:20.132 --> 01:05:21.260 align:middle line:90%
dominant one.

01:05:21.260 --> 01:05:23.840 align:middle line:84%
But this type of medicine
right here is like--

01:05:23.840 --> 01:05:26.615 align:middle line:84%
we call that the
super charcoals.

01:05:26.615 --> 01:05:27.740 align:middle line:90%
There's activated charcoal.

01:05:27.740 --> 01:05:30.620 align:middle line:84%
And this, again, is present
in all activated charcoal.

01:05:30.620 --> 01:05:32.780 align:middle line:84%
It's just a very
small percentage.

01:05:32.780 --> 01:05:34.670 align:middle line:10%
What the breakthrough
of the super charcoals

01:05:34.670 --> 01:05:36.530 align:middle line:10%
has brought to us
is that there might

01:05:36.530 --> 01:05:39.230 align:middle line:10%
be a possibility of extending
life dramatically and in fact,

01:05:39.230 --> 01:05:41.780 align:middle line:10%
this case, doubling the
lifespan of mice and rats

01:05:41.780 --> 01:05:45.350 align:middle line:10%
with just the C60 only, which
isn't the only naturally

01:05:45.350 --> 01:05:47.370 align:middle line:10%
occurring allotrope here.

01:05:47.370 --> 01:05:49.700 align:middle line:10%
C60's usually about 60%.

01:05:49.700 --> 01:05:52.610 align:middle line:10%
C70's usually about 30%.

01:05:52.610 --> 01:05:54.550 align:middle line:10%
And the rest of them
are the other 10%

01:05:54.550 --> 01:05:57.230 align:middle line:10%
of that little fraction
of the activated

01:05:57.230 --> 01:05:59.480 align:middle line:10%
charcoal that has the curved--

01:05:59.480 --> 01:06:00.720 align:middle line:10%
that's not flat.

01:06:00.720 --> 01:06:03.920 align:middle line:84%
It's got the curved
structure we call fullerenes.

01:06:03.920 --> 01:06:06.650 align:middle line:84%
And this area's going to be
seeing a lot more activity

01:06:06.650 --> 01:06:07.490 align:middle line:90%
in our lifetime.

01:06:07.490 --> 01:06:10.280 align:middle line:84%
My personal favorite product
that I make for myself

01:06:10.280 --> 01:06:12.942 align:middle line:90%
is the C60 with the C70.

01:06:12.942 --> 01:06:14.900 align:middle line:84%
And the other one's in
the right ratio, the way

01:06:14.900 --> 01:06:16.460 align:middle line:90%
that they appear in nature.

01:06:16.460 --> 01:06:19.610 align:middle line:84%
All the products today
are just C60 by itself.

01:06:19.610 --> 01:06:21.650 align:middle line:84%
I like the-- actually
the mixed product.

01:06:21.650 --> 01:06:23.560 align:middle line:84%
But the public's not
ready for that one yet.

01:06:23.560 --> 01:06:24.915 align:middle line:90%
It's just a little bit too new.

01:06:35.180 --> 01:06:35.750 align:middle line:90%
>> Do you sell it?

01:06:35.750 --> 01:06:36.140 align:middle line:90%
>> I do.

01:06:36.140 --> 01:06:37.100 align:middle line:90%
>> What is it called?

01:06:37.100 --> 01:06:39.869 align:middle line:84%
>> It's called
Wolfe Carbon Detox.

01:06:39.869 --> 01:06:42.827 align:middle line:84%
>> Is there anything else
you suggest to increase

01:06:42.827 --> 01:06:44.310 align:middle line:90%
[INAUDIBLE]?

01:06:44.310 --> 01:06:47.940 align:middle line:84%
>> Saunas-- of course, sauna,
movement, deep breathing,

01:06:47.940 --> 01:06:51.330 align:middle line:84%
getting upside down,
yoga, sweating,

01:06:51.330 --> 01:06:52.360 align:middle line:90%
and all of the above--

01:06:52.360 --> 01:06:53.160 align:middle line:90%
hot/cold.

01:06:53.160 --> 01:06:54.380 align:middle line:90%
>> Body scrubs.

01:06:54.380 --> 01:06:56.640 align:middle line:84%
>> Yep, body
scrubs, strip that--

01:06:56.640 --> 01:06:59.227 align:middle line:84%
well, that's the kind of
stuff that we basically--

01:06:59.227 --> 01:07:01.560 align:middle line:84%
when we get you in the group
on a detox, we're like, OK,

01:07:01.560 --> 01:07:03.390 align:middle line:84%
today is going to be
the body scrub day.

01:07:03.390 --> 01:07:05.100 align:middle line:84%
Or today you're going
to do the coffee enema.

01:07:05.100 --> 01:07:05.850 align:middle line:90%
Here's what you're going to do.

01:07:05.850 --> 01:07:07.410 align:middle line:90%
You're going to brew the coffee.

01:07:07.410 --> 01:07:08.980 align:middle line:90%
You're going to dilute it 50%.

01:07:08.980 --> 01:07:10.910 align:middle line:84%
You're going to put it the
enema bag or the enema bowl

01:07:10.910 --> 01:07:11.310 align:middle line:90%
or whatever.

01:07:11.310 --> 01:07:13.110 align:middle line:84%
So we're going-- every day is
a different thing like that.

01:07:13.110 --> 01:07:14.530 align:middle line:84%
So we always have
something to do.

01:07:14.530 --> 01:07:16.440 align:middle line:84%
When you have something
like that to do,

01:07:16.440 --> 01:07:17.620 align:middle line:90%
that takes a bit of time.

01:07:17.620 --> 01:07:18.510 align:middle line:84%
And what that
means is you're not

01:07:18.510 --> 01:07:20.610 align:middle line:84%
going to be able to have time
to eat or think about eating

01:07:20.610 --> 01:07:23.068 align:middle line:84%
because you got to spend time
like, hey, I've got to detox.

01:07:23.068 --> 01:07:24.690 align:middle line:84%
I've got to do
this mission today.

01:07:24.690 --> 01:07:25.970 align:middle line:84%
Real quick, somebody's
who's not asked a question.

01:07:25.970 --> 01:07:26.770 align:middle line:90%
Yes?

01:07:26.770 --> 01:07:31.630 align:middle line:84%
>> What if someone
that [INAUDIBLE]

01:07:31.630 --> 01:07:32.990 align:middle line:90%
>> What-- OK, I would say this.

01:07:32.990 --> 01:07:36.500 align:middle line:84%
I have had people who completely
recovered and came back

01:07:36.500 --> 01:07:38.570 align:middle line:90%
and who were given up for dead.

01:07:38.570 --> 01:07:40.820 align:middle line:84%
In that particular case,
what I always turn to

01:07:40.820 --> 01:07:43.910 align:middle line:84%
is people like my friend
Howard, who do psychic healing

01:07:43.910 --> 01:07:46.905 align:middle line:84%
and can help bring that
person and their soul

01:07:46.905 --> 01:07:47.780 align:middle line:90%
back into their body.

01:07:47.780 --> 01:07:50.720 align:middle line:84%
And basically what he does, he
does seven generation healing,

01:07:50.720 --> 01:07:51.520 align:middle line:90%
right?

01:07:51.520 --> 01:07:53.150 align:middle line:84%
So typically what
happens is we have

01:07:53.150 --> 01:07:55.640 align:middle line:84%
issues that are in our
lineage, and it comes up

01:07:55.640 --> 01:07:56.810 align:middle line:90%
through the lineage.

01:07:56.810 --> 01:07:58.970 align:middle line:84%
And so if you work off
those issues, for example,

01:07:58.970 --> 01:08:04.998 align:middle line:84%
let's say somebody in
your lineage was greedy.

01:08:04.998 --> 01:08:07.040 align:middle line:84%
And then you have to kind
of deal with that greed

01:08:07.040 --> 01:08:08.430 align:middle line:90%
coming up through the lineage.

01:08:08.430 --> 01:08:10.180 align:middle line:84%
And then at some point
you have to go, OK,

01:08:10.180 --> 01:08:11.585 align:middle line:90%
we have to neutralize this now.

01:08:11.585 --> 01:08:12.960 align:middle line:84%
And the way you
neutralize it is,

01:08:12.960 --> 01:08:15.377 align:middle line:84%
is neutralizing in your own
life and then working backward

01:08:15.377 --> 01:08:16.680 align:middle line:90%
through your ancestors.

01:08:16.680 --> 01:08:19.550 align:middle line:84%
So having someone like that,
as a psychic healer, basically,

01:08:19.550 --> 01:08:22.729 align:middle line:84%
working on someone who's been in
a coma I think is a good idea.

01:08:22.729 --> 01:08:23.660 align:middle line:90%
It can't hurt.

01:08:23.660 --> 01:08:25.560 align:middle line:84%
We know now-- we
have the evidence.

01:08:25.560 --> 01:08:27.950 align:middle line:84%
We have the scientific
evidence that a thought

01:08:27.950 --> 01:08:30.043 align:middle line:90%
can be transferred into a room.

01:08:30.043 --> 01:08:32.210 align:middle line:84%
We've known that for a long
time with remote viewing

01:08:32.210 --> 01:08:33.710 align:middle line:84%
and all this other stuff
that's been going on.

01:08:33.710 --> 01:08:34.510 align:middle line:90%
We know that.

01:08:34.510 --> 01:08:37.819 align:middle line:84%
But it's-- the evidence
is getting harder, right?

01:08:37.819 --> 01:08:39.439 align:middle line:90%
It's becoming more real.

01:08:39.439 --> 01:08:40.530 align:middle line:90%
Question over here?

01:08:40.530 --> 01:08:44.450 align:middle line:84%
>> [INAUDIBLE] wouldn't
carbons slow down the ALS?

01:08:44.450 --> 01:08:45.896 align:middle line:84%
That's what I
really [INAUDIBLE]..

01:08:45.896 --> 01:08:46.729 align:middle line:90%
>> I can't tell you.

01:08:46.729 --> 01:08:47.593 align:middle line:90%
I don't know.

01:08:47.593 --> 01:08:49.010 align:middle line:84%
Will the carbon
slow down the ALS?

01:08:49.010 --> 01:08:49.814 align:middle line:90%
I don't know.

01:08:49.814 --> 01:08:50.614 align:middle line:90%
It's worth a try.

01:08:50.614 --> 01:08:51.689 align:middle line:90%
>> I was going to say--

01:08:51.689 --> 01:08:51.960 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

01:08:51.960 --> 01:08:53.293 align:middle line:90%
>>--go ahead and take it anyway.

01:08:53.293 --> 01:08:54.529 align:middle line:90%
>> Sure.

01:08:54.529 --> 01:08:56.600 align:middle line:84%
Let's just talk about
charcoal and its nature.

01:08:56.600 --> 01:08:59.180 align:middle line:84%
So charcoal and these
things, these fullerenes,

01:08:59.180 --> 01:09:04.279 align:middle line:84%
are the most anti-toxic
substances ever found, right?

01:09:04.279 --> 01:09:05.610 align:middle line:90%
Just take that on.

01:09:05.610 --> 01:09:06.410 align:middle line:90%
Feel into that.

01:09:06.410 --> 01:09:07.429 align:middle line:90%
OK, question?

01:09:07.429 --> 01:09:07.879 align:middle line:90%
>> Hi.

01:09:07.879 --> 01:09:09.229 align:middle line:84%
I was wondering
about morgellons --

01:09:09.229 --> 01:09:10.029 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

01:09:10.029 --> 01:09:11.992 align:middle line:84%
>> --for Lyme and
[INAUDIBLE] infections.

01:09:11.992 --> 01:09:13.700 align:middle line:84%
Have you worked with
anyone [INAUDIBLE]??

01:09:13.700 --> 01:09:14.500 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

01:09:14.500 --> 01:09:17.359 align:middle line:90%
Massive cases of Lyme's.

01:09:17.359 --> 01:09:19.760 align:middle line:84%
Lyme's is a particular
pet peeve of mine

01:09:19.760 --> 01:09:21.689 align:middle line:90%
because I read the stories.

01:09:21.689 --> 01:09:22.970 align:middle line:90%
I know the history.

01:09:22.970 --> 01:09:27.050 align:middle line:84%
I know Dr. Erich Traub's whole
story of how he was-- his role

01:09:27.050 --> 01:09:32.689 align:middle line:84%
was to make existing tick
diseases weaponized, making

01:09:32.689 --> 01:09:33.859 align:middle line:90%
them 10 times more virulent.

01:09:33.859 --> 01:09:35.984 align:middle line:84%
I can't tell you how my
heart sank when I found out

01:09:35.984 --> 01:09:38.840 align:middle line:84%
that he's an Operation Paperclip
Nazi who they grabbed out

01:09:38.840 --> 01:09:39.685 align:middle line:90%
of Berlin.

01:09:39.685 --> 01:09:42.060 align:middle line:84%
This is Lyme disease real
quick, little download on this.

01:09:42.060 --> 01:09:43.399 align:middle line:84%
There's a way to
deal with Lyme's.

01:09:43.399 --> 01:09:44.240 align:middle line:90%
It's a protocol.

01:09:44.240 --> 01:09:45.630 align:middle line:84%
You have to come
talk to me about it

01:09:45.630 --> 01:09:46.490 align:middle line:84%
because I can lay
it down for you.

01:09:46.490 --> 01:09:48.300 align:middle line:84%
But there's two key
piece of that protocol.

01:09:48.300 --> 01:09:50.930 align:middle line:90%
One key piece is a zapper.

01:09:50.930 --> 01:09:53.660 align:middle line:84%
So a zapper, like
this right here--

01:09:53.660 --> 01:09:55.970 align:middle line:84%
see, I have this on an injury
that I have right here.

01:09:55.970 --> 01:09:57.703 align:middle line:90%
See that zapper?

01:09:57.703 --> 01:09:59.120 align:middle line:84%
You've got to have
a zapper, which

01:09:59.120 --> 01:10:01.560 align:middle line:84%
means you've got an electronic
device on you at all times.

01:10:01.560 --> 01:10:05.210 align:middle line:84%
It disturbs the circadian rhythm
of the Lyme and the Morgellons.

01:10:05.210 --> 01:10:09.260 align:middle line:84%
If you don't have that,
you're out to sea.

01:10:09.260 --> 01:10:10.400 align:middle line:90%
I don't know what to do.

01:10:10.400 --> 01:10:11.440 align:middle line:84%
At that point, it's
like you're going

01:10:11.440 --> 01:10:13.550 align:middle line:84%
to be trusting that your
immune system can jump on

01:10:13.550 --> 01:10:16.100 align:middle line:84%
the problem as soon
as it ramps up,

01:10:16.100 --> 01:10:19.490 align:middle line:84%
which is very difficult because
the Lyme's and the Morgellons

01:10:19.490 --> 01:10:23.075 align:middle line:84%
disables your immune system for
six to eight hours, ramps up.

01:10:23.075 --> 01:10:24.950 align:middle line:84%
And then by the time
your immune system goes,

01:10:24.950 --> 01:10:27.540 align:middle line:84%
uh-oh, we got a
problem, it's too late.

01:10:27.540 --> 01:10:28.800 align:middle line:90%
Does that makes sense?

01:10:28.800 --> 01:10:31.535 align:middle line:84%
So that's why zapping all the
time-- like I've an injury.

01:10:31.535 --> 01:10:32.660 align:middle line:90%
I'm putting a zapper on it.

01:10:32.660 --> 01:10:33.460 align:middle line:90%
Why?

01:10:33.460 --> 01:10:35.780 align:middle line:84%
Because that helps to heal
it-- makes it heal quicker.

01:10:35.780 --> 01:10:38.240 align:middle line:84%
But at the same time, it
has very interesting effects

01:10:38.240 --> 01:10:39.567 align:middle line:90%
on the immune system.

01:10:39.567 --> 01:10:40.400 align:middle line:90%
So that's one piece.

01:10:40.400 --> 01:10:43.700 align:middle line:84%
The other piece is
herbal, the herbal piece.

01:10:43.700 --> 01:10:48.740 align:middle line:84%
You've got to be-- my god, we
got to go herbal in this room.

01:10:48.740 --> 01:10:49.840 align:middle line:90%
Food is one thing.

01:10:49.840 --> 01:10:51.630 align:middle line:90%
Herbs are more important.

01:10:51.630 --> 01:10:52.430 align:middle line:90%
It's time.

01:10:52.430 --> 01:10:53.230 align:middle line:10%
OK.

01:10:53.230 --> 01:10:54.620 align:middle line:10%
>> [INAUDIBLE] CD?

01:10:54.620 --> 01:10:56.768 align:middle line:90%
>> So I'm down in booth 256.

01:10:56.768 --> 01:10:57.810 align:middle line:90%
So you can find me there.

01:10:57.810 --> 01:10:58.870 align:middle line:90%
This is my cousin here.

01:10:58.870 --> 01:10:59.825 align:middle line:90%
Sherman, jump up.

01:10:59.825 --> 01:11:00.950 align:middle line:90%
You can recognize this guy.

01:11:00.950 --> 01:11:01.880 align:middle line:90%
See this tank right here?

01:11:01.880 --> 01:11:02.680 align:middle line:90%
Boom.

01:11:02.680 --> 01:11:04.100 align:middle line:90%
Come find this guy right here.

01:11:04.100 --> 01:11:05.090 align:middle line:90%
He'll be in my booth.

01:11:05.090 --> 01:11:06.048 align:middle line:90%
He's easy to recognize.

01:11:06.048 --> 01:11:07.010 align:middle line:90%
I'll be with him.

01:11:07.010 --> 01:11:07.520 align:middle line:90%
There's Karen.

01:11:07.520 --> 01:11:08.478 align:middle line:90%
Karen, raise your hand.

01:11:08.478 --> 01:11:10.280 align:middle line:90%
She's with us, Angela as well.

01:11:10.280 --> 01:11:11.960 align:middle line:90%
>> Where do you get a zapper?

01:11:11.960 --> 01:11:12.670 align:middle line:90%
>> Where do you get a zapper?

01:11:12.670 --> 01:11:14.100 align:middle line:84%
You've got to dig one
up on the internet.

01:11:14.100 --> 01:11:15.683 align:middle line:84%
Unfortunately my
good friend Don Croft

01:11:15.683 --> 01:11:17.630 align:middle line:84%
passed away in a
paragliding accident.

01:11:17.630 --> 01:11:22.327 align:middle line:84%
And we're just now having to
renew the production of Zappers

01:11:22.327 --> 01:11:23.285 align:middle line:90%
through different ways.

01:11:23.285 --> 01:11:24.660 align:middle line:84%
>> Let's give
David Wolfe a hand.

01:11:24.660 --> 01:11:25.610 align:middle line:90%
>> Thank you.

01:11:25.610 --> 01:11:27.110 align:middle line:90%
[APPLAUSE]

01:11:27.110 --> 01:11:30.460 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

01:11:30.460 --> 01:11:33.000 align:middle line:90%
