00:00:02.940 --> 00:00:06.400 align:middle line:90%


00:00:06.400 --> 00:00:09.030 align:middle line:10%
>>ALAN STEINFELD: I want to
introduce my colleagues here,

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:13.210 align:middle line:10%
Dr. Desiree Hurtak Dr.
JJ Hurtak, the founders

00:00:13.210 --> 00:00:15.670 align:middle line:10%
of the Academy for
Future Science, which

00:00:15.670 --> 00:00:21.820 align:middle line:10%
includes linguistic
archeology, ultraterrestrials

00:00:21.820 --> 00:00:23.550 align:middle line:10%
and ancient civilizations.

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:28.690 align:middle line:84%
So they travel the world,
trying to connect the dots

00:00:28.690 --> 00:00:31.660 align:middle line:84%
into the higher consciousness
of the human being,

00:00:31.660 --> 00:00:33.760 align:middle line:84%
and it's been my
honor and pleasure

00:00:33.760 --> 00:00:37.690 align:middle line:84%
to travel with them at times
and look into their world.

00:00:37.690 --> 00:00:39.710 align:middle line:90%
Because they are nonstop--

00:00:39.710 --> 00:00:43.030 align:middle line:90%
they are doing it all the time.

00:00:43.030 --> 00:00:44.140 align:middle line:90%
There's no vacation.

00:00:44.140 --> 00:00:46.210 align:middle line:84%
There's no rest
for these people.

00:00:46.210 --> 00:00:49.518 align:middle line:84%
They are on target all the
time, and it's great to see.

00:00:49.518 --> 00:00:51.310 align:middle line:10%
>>JJ HURTAK: So if you
look at the exhibit,

00:00:51.310 --> 00:00:54.140 align:middle line:10%
you can see the non-stop
grid of consciousness spread

00:00:54.140 --> 00:00:54.940 align:middle line:10%
over Mother Earth.

00:00:54.940 --> 00:00:57.790 align:middle line:84%
This is the pushing
of the envelope

00:00:57.790 --> 00:01:01.180 align:middle line:84%
of where we are in the
present scheme of things

00:01:01.180 --> 00:01:05.500 align:middle line:84%
and the realization that we
must take one step beyond where

00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:08.810 align:middle line:84%
most cosmologists are, whether
it's [INAUDIBLE],, Wendy

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:12.850 align:middle line:84%
Freedman, many of the others
who look at the singular

00:01:12.850 --> 00:01:13.850 align:middle line:90%
structure of the cosmos.

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:16.058 align:middle line:84%
>>DESIREE HURTAK: And so
what we're really doing here

00:01:16.058 --> 00:01:17.270 align:middle line:90%
is activating the grid.

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:19.240 align:middle line:84%
And that's what we
wanted to show here,

00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:22.672 align:middle line:84%
because we're going to close
with a very powerful meditation

00:01:22.672 --> 00:01:24.880 align:middle line:84%
for those of you who've been
with us at other places,

00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:28.000 align:middle line:84%
like Contact in the
Desert, Integratron.

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:31.300 align:middle line:84%
We're able to get into
those other realities.

00:01:31.300 --> 00:01:32.470 align:middle line:10%
I hope you can feel that.

00:01:32.470 --> 00:01:34.420 align:middle line:10%
But first and
foremost is the fact

00:01:34.420 --> 00:01:36.980 align:middle line:10%
that this planet
is a grid network.

00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:38.740 align:middle line:10%
And so we're part of that.

00:01:38.740 --> 00:01:41.750 align:middle line:10%
Things are shifting-- I
think everyone feels that.

00:01:41.750 --> 00:01:44.447 align:middle line:10%
And this is part of the energy
that's taking place right now.

00:01:44.447 --> 00:01:46.700 align:middle line:10%
>>STEINFELD: And we're a
microcosm of that grid.

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:49.330 align:middle line:10%
That grid is external,
but it's also internal.

00:01:49.330 --> 00:01:52.990 align:middle line:10%
We carry it around with us
within our mental emotional

00:01:52.990 --> 00:01:54.190 align:middle line:10%
structures.

00:01:54.190 --> 00:01:55.495 align:middle line:10%
So it's part of us.

00:01:55.495 --> 00:01:58.390 align:middle line:10%
>>DESIREE HURTAK: So let's go
on from there and see what else.

00:01:58.390 --> 00:02:02.950 align:middle line:10%
Dr. Hurtak and I were just in
Barcelona a little while ago,

00:02:02.950 --> 00:02:05.350 align:middle line:10%
and you may notice Michio Kaku.

00:02:05.350 --> 00:02:09.900 align:middle line:10%
This is the first UFO conference
he was ever speaking at,

00:02:09.900 --> 00:02:12.670 align:middle line:10%
and he was actually
fairly open-minded.

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:14.780 align:middle line:10%
For those of you
who don't know him,

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:16.930 align:middle line:10%
he's well known
for string theory,

00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:18.730 align:middle line:10%
and he has the
understanding that there

00:02:18.730 --> 00:02:22.690 align:middle line:10%
can be like 10 or 11
dimensions of our reality.

00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:26.805 align:middle line:10%
So it's amazing to see him in
the midst of Nick Pope, Jaime

00:02:26.805 --> 00:02:27.605 align:middle line:10%
Maussan ourselves.

00:02:27.605 --> 00:02:29.855 align:middle line:10%
>>JJ HURTAK: JJ HURTAK: Nike
Pope was the first person

00:02:29.855 --> 00:02:34.000 align:middle line:10%
to lease the documents in the
British government in 1996--

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:35.740 align:middle line:10%
the first disclosure papers.

00:02:35.740 --> 00:02:38.860 align:middle line:84%
And of course Jaime Maussan
is a great colleague.

00:02:38.860 --> 00:02:41.890 align:middle line:84%
I had the opportunity
of working with him

00:02:41.890 --> 00:02:45.040 align:middle line:84%
in Mexico City at
Televisa and opening

00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:48.430 align:middle line:84%
a new direction with documents
from the Mexican government

00:02:48.430 --> 00:02:50.380 align:middle line:84%
as to the cosmic
others who are watching

00:02:50.380 --> 00:02:51.660 align:middle line:90%
our evolutionary process.

00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:54.670 align:middle line:84%
>>STEINFELD: Well, has one of
the most watched UFO programs

00:02:54.670 --> 00:02:57.330 align:middle line:84%
in Latin America and
Mexico on Telemundo.

00:02:57.330 --> 00:02:58.600 align:middle line:90%
It is huge.

00:02:58.600 --> 00:03:00.660 align:middle line:84%
People love him,
and he's known--

00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:03.460 align:middle line:84%
they're much more open
about ETs and UFOs

00:03:03.460 --> 00:03:05.453 align:middle line:90%
in Mexico and South America.

00:03:05.453 --> 00:03:07.120 align:middle line:84%
>>DESIREE HURTAK: And
on the other side,

00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:08.578 align:middle line:84%
one of the people
maybe some of you

00:03:08.578 --> 00:03:12.820 align:middle line:84%
recognize as the head of MUFON,
which is Jan Harzan, and others

00:03:12.820 --> 00:03:14.170 align:middle line:90%
who are from Latin America.

00:03:14.170 --> 00:03:16.428 align:middle line:10%
Anyway, I just want to say
that the UFO field-- we're

00:03:16.428 --> 00:03:17.970 align:middle line:10%
going to start with
UFOs, we're going

00:03:17.970 --> 00:03:19.750 align:middle line:10%
to get into
multidimensions, we're

00:03:19.750 --> 00:03:22.270 align:middle line:10%
going to end with a meditation.

00:03:22.270 --> 00:03:24.652 align:middle line:10%
But the UFO field is
certainly waking up.

00:03:24.652 --> 00:03:26.110 align:middle line:10%
>>JJ HURTAK: It's
the hard evidence

00:03:26.110 --> 00:03:28.402 align:middle line:10%
of government disclosure
going on throughout the world.

00:03:28.402 --> 00:03:31.870 align:middle line:10%
So we can spend time looking
at the theoretical structures

00:03:31.870 --> 00:03:34.630 align:middle line:10%
of what cosmology
is, but this really

00:03:34.630 --> 00:03:37.360 align:middle line:10%
realization that we
are participating

00:03:37.360 --> 00:03:41.260 align:middle line:10%
as multidimensional beings in
a living cosmology, a living

00:03:41.260 --> 00:03:43.965 align:middle line:10%
language of
consciousness experience.

00:03:43.965 --> 00:03:46.090 align:middle line:84%
>>STEINFELD: What was that
thing, when I asked you,

00:03:46.090 --> 00:03:48.880 align:middle line:84%
what do you want to communicate
to this audience today?

00:03:48.880 --> 00:03:50.345 align:middle line:90%
You said something really--

00:03:50.345 --> 00:03:52.030 align:middle line:84%
>>JJ HURTAK: Well
the living universe

00:03:52.030 --> 00:03:57.257 align:middle line:84%
is a cosmology as a
language of co-creation.

00:03:57.257 --> 00:03:59.590 align:middle line:84%
>>STEINFELD: The universe is
a language of co-creation--

00:03:59.590 --> 00:04:03.910 align:middle line:84%
that we're learning to
understand as evolving beings

00:04:03.910 --> 00:04:05.505 align:middle line:90%
of consciousness.

00:04:05.505 --> 00:04:08.110 align:middle line:10%
>>DESIREE HURTAK: So the
UFO field is waking up,

00:04:08.110 --> 00:04:10.510 align:middle line:10%
and the physicists,
even around the world,

00:04:10.510 --> 00:04:13.550 align:middle line:10%
are starting to understand that
there's no way we can be alone

00:04:13.550 --> 00:04:14.350 align:middle line:10%
in the universe.

00:04:14.350 --> 00:04:15.892 align:middle line:10%
And even the
governments-- and I know

00:04:15.892 --> 00:04:19.060 align:middle line:10%
we're all waiting for cosmic
disclosure from the US,

00:04:19.060 --> 00:04:20.620 align:middle line:10%
but other countries
have done it.

00:04:20.620 --> 00:04:24.460 align:middle line:10%
One that you may not know
about is the Chilean government

00:04:24.460 --> 00:04:27.650 align:middle line:10%
released this information.

00:04:27.650 --> 00:04:30.250 align:middle line:84%
this is from the
Chilean Air Force,

00:04:30.250 --> 00:04:33.910 align:middle line:84%
and it was footage
taken November 11, 2014

00:04:33.910 --> 00:04:37.250 align:middle line:90%
by a Navy helicopter.

00:04:37.250 --> 00:04:40.960 align:middle line:84%
Interesting that even
also on the Nimitz area,

00:04:40.960 --> 00:04:42.370 align:middle line:90%
that's all Navy.

00:04:42.370 --> 00:04:44.200 align:middle line:84%
And, in fact, the
Navy is actually

00:04:44.200 --> 00:04:48.820 align:middle line:84%
in front of the Air Force in
terms of sightings and contact

00:04:48.820 --> 00:04:50.470 align:middle line:90%
with alien intelligences.

00:04:50.470 --> 00:04:53.920 align:middle line:84%
This is because a lot of them
use our waters, our oceans,

00:04:53.920 --> 00:04:55.788 align:middle line:90%
to go in and out.

00:04:55.788 --> 00:04:57.580 align:middle line:84%
>>STEINFELD: No, the
Navy and the Air Force

00:04:57.580 --> 00:05:01.150 align:middle line:84%
don't really communicate
with each other on ET stuff.

00:05:01.150 --> 00:05:03.130 align:middle line:84%
They have their
own sort of policy.

00:05:03.130 --> 00:05:05.750 align:middle line:84%
The Air Force was into
debunking it for a long time,

00:05:05.750 --> 00:05:08.228 align:middle line:84%
and the Navy now is coming
out and saying, nope,

00:05:08.228 --> 00:05:09.270 align:middle line:90%
there's things out there.

00:05:09.270 --> 00:05:12.930 align:middle line:84%
So there's factions within
the government structure

00:05:12.930 --> 00:05:15.880 align:middle line:84%
that is allowing more and more
UFO information to come out

00:05:15.880 --> 00:05:16.680 align:middle line:90%
to the public.

00:05:16.680 --> 00:05:19.947 align:middle line:84%
So we are heading towards
positive awakening disclosures.

00:05:19.947 --> 00:05:21.780 align:middle line:10%
>>JJ HURTAK: So this
the consciousness shift

00:05:21.780 --> 00:05:23.655 align:middle line:10%
that's being helped by
government disclosures

00:05:23.655 --> 00:05:25.230 align:middle line:10%
throughout the world.

00:05:25.230 --> 00:05:27.960 align:middle line:10%
Thousands of documents
are being released

00:05:27.960 --> 00:05:29.820 align:middle line:10%
showing that there
has been not only

00:05:29.820 --> 00:05:32.400 align:middle line:10%
contact on a physical
level, but also

00:05:32.400 --> 00:05:35.020 align:middle line:10%
on a transphysical
consciousness level.

00:05:35.020 --> 00:05:39.000 align:middle line:10%
It's the new area of information
coming from behind the scenes

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:40.620 align:middle line:10%
that's critical at this stage.

00:05:40.620 --> 00:05:41.130 align:middle line:10%
>>DESIREE HURTAK:
And I just want

00:05:41.130 --> 00:05:42.660 align:middle line:10%
to say, regarding
this, which we're

00:05:42.660 --> 00:05:44.220 align:middle line:10%
going to be seeing
in about a moment,

00:05:44.220 --> 00:05:48.720 align:middle line:10%
although I speeded up the
sequence so that our lecture is

00:05:48.720 --> 00:05:52.680 align:middle line:10%
shorter tonight, but the object
was detected by the pilot.

00:05:52.680 --> 00:05:55.320 align:middle line:84%
This is quite often
the case, or sometimes

00:05:55.320 --> 00:06:00.120 align:middle line:84%
by forward-looking infrared,
but usually regular radar.

00:06:00.120 --> 00:06:03.810 align:middle line:84%
And in this case, the radar
towers at the nearby airports

00:06:03.810 --> 00:06:05.710 align:middle line:90%
did not pick this up.

00:06:05.710 --> 00:06:06.780 align:middle line:90%
So that's very important.

00:06:06.780 --> 00:06:09.780 align:middle line:84%
Pilots can sometimes see it,
certain types of infrared can

00:06:09.780 --> 00:06:12.090 align:middle line:84%
see it, but regular
radar cannot.

00:06:12.090 --> 00:06:13.350 align:middle line:90%
Let's take a look at this.

00:06:13.350 --> 00:06:17.550 align:middle line:84%
What's interesting is it
emits two strange bursts.

00:06:17.550 --> 00:06:20.190 align:middle line:84%
It's like a thermal
path behind this ship.

00:06:20.190 --> 00:06:22.740 align:middle line:84%
So this is from
the Chilean Navy.

00:06:22.740 --> 00:06:26.720 align:middle line:90%


00:06:26.720 --> 00:06:29.800 align:middle line:84%
And you can see the
data regarding it.

00:06:29.800 --> 00:06:32.440 align:middle line:10%
And so you wonder,
what is this first

00:06:32.440 --> 00:06:33.670 align:middle line:10%
that comes out from there?

00:06:33.670 --> 00:06:36.820 align:middle line:10%
Well, it's interesting,
around Fukushima

00:06:36.820 --> 00:06:38.800 align:middle line:10%
there's actually been UFOs.

00:06:38.800 --> 00:06:41.890 align:middle line:84%
Around Argentina, where
there's nuclear power

00:06:41.890 --> 00:06:45.850 align:middle line:84%
plants that are always
emitting stuff, there's UFOs.

00:06:45.850 --> 00:06:48.940 align:middle line:10%
They are totally against
us doing anything

00:06:48.940 --> 00:06:52.185 align:middle line:10%
with nuclear power and
other types of scenarios

00:06:52.185 --> 00:06:53.435 align:middle line:10%
that they want to be able to--

00:06:53.435 --> 00:06:54.852 align:middle line:10%
>>JJ HURTAK: We've
seen a plethora

00:06:54.852 --> 00:06:56.490 align:middle line:10%
of extraterrestrial
slash UFO events

00:06:56.490 --> 00:07:00.070 align:middle line:10%
around volcanic activity,
nuclear weapons storage areas.

00:07:00.070 --> 00:07:03.550 align:middle line:10%
There seems to be a correlation
also with sacred sites

00:07:03.550 --> 00:07:05.440 align:middle line:10%
according to the indigenous
elders that we've

00:07:05.440 --> 00:07:08.870 align:middle line:10%
talked to in Peru and Brazil.

00:07:08.870 --> 00:07:11.530 align:middle line:10%
What we're seeing here now--
please watch the screen very

00:07:11.530 --> 00:07:12.640 align:middle line:10%
carefully--

00:07:12.640 --> 00:07:17.500 align:middle line:10%
is the fact that there was
a unknown, gaseous material

00:07:17.500 --> 00:07:19.240 align:middle line:10%
released in the
lower atmosphere.

00:07:19.240 --> 00:07:22.390 align:middle line:84%
Was this a trick of
government intelligence

00:07:22.390 --> 00:07:27.670 align:middle line:84%
to make, as it were, a pseudo
UFO event for public awareness?

00:07:27.670 --> 00:07:30.280 align:middle line:84%
Or was this a test being
done for our benefit

00:07:30.280 --> 00:07:33.220 align:middle line:84%
by extraterrestrial
friends who want

00:07:33.220 --> 00:07:35.860 align:middle line:84%
to point out the dangers
that were now taking place?

00:07:35.860 --> 00:07:35.960 align:middle line:90%
>>STEINFELD: Yeah.

00:07:35.960 --> 00:07:37.900 align:middle line:84%
Some people think they
clean our atmospheres,

00:07:37.900 --> 00:07:39.140 align:middle line:90%
and I think they do.

00:07:39.140 --> 00:07:42.370 align:middle line:84%
And you know if you look at
the history of UFO crashes

00:07:42.370 --> 00:07:46.220 align:middle line:84%
or landings, Roswell was right
near the first atomic test

00:07:46.220 --> 00:07:47.020 align:middle line:90%
site.

00:07:47.020 --> 00:07:49.910 align:middle line:84%
So they're very worried
that, what they say,

00:07:49.910 --> 00:07:52.810 align:middle line:84%
the kids have the car keys,
and we don't know how to drive.

00:07:52.810 --> 00:07:55.750 align:middle line:84%
And that's why they're
here to kind of direct--

00:07:55.750 --> 00:07:57.730 align:middle line:84%
make sure we don't
blow ourselves up.

00:07:57.730 --> 00:07:59.363 align:middle line:90%
>>DESIREE HURTAK: So Alan?

00:07:59.363 --> 00:08:00.280 align:middle line:90%
>>STEINFELD: Oh, yeah.

00:08:00.280 --> 00:08:03.130 align:middle line:84%
So people want to know
why no one sees ETs?

00:08:03.130 --> 00:08:06.100 align:middle line:84%
Because everyone's looking at
their cell phone, that's why.

00:08:06.100 --> 00:08:07.540 align:middle line:90%
You know, they're looking down.

00:08:07.540 --> 00:08:08.830 align:middle line:90%
That's the cartoon I found.

00:08:08.830 --> 00:08:11.680 align:middle line:84%
But really, if we
looked up and realized

00:08:11.680 --> 00:08:15.370 align:middle line:84%
that we are part of the
cosmos, our consciousness

00:08:15.370 --> 00:08:19.760 align:middle line:84%
is not of this earth
plane, we are the ETs.

00:08:19.760 --> 00:08:21.760 align:middle line:90%
We were extraterrestrial.

00:08:21.760 --> 00:08:25.270 align:middle line:84%
This thinking mechanism
is not an evolution

00:08:25.270 --> 00:08:27.860 align:middle line:84%
of the animals and
the evolving primates.

00:08:27.860 --> 00:08:30.250 align:middle line:90%
We came from someplace else.

00:08:30.250 --> 00:08:32.970 align:middle line:84%
I don't know where, but we
didn't evolve from Earth.

00:08:32.970 --> 00:08:33.770 align:middle line:90%
I know that.

00:08:33.770 --> 00:08:35.230 align:middle line:84%
>>DESIREE HURTAK: We did
not evolve from Earth.

00:08:35.230 --> 00:08:36.220 align:middle line:90%
>>STEINFELD: That's what I said.

00:08:36.220 --> 00:08:36.602 align:middle line:90%
>>DESIREE HURTAK: Exactly.

00:08:36.602 --> 00:08:38.060 align:middle line:84%
>>JJ HURTAK: The
Indigenous tell us

00:08:38.060 --> 00:08:40.480 align:middle line:84%
that just as their habitats
are being destroyed,

00:08:40.480 --> 00:08:42.835 align:middle line:84%
our habitats in the
north will be destroyed.

00:08:42.835 --> 00:08:44.710 align:middle line:84%
And the dangerous signs
are being pointed out

00:08:44.710 --> 00:08:45.700 align:middle line:90%
in graphic ways.

00:08:45.700 --> 00:08:49.337 align:middle line:84%
And so is this, shall we
say, an anomalous object

00:08:49.337 --> 00:08:50.170 align:middle line:90%
that has no meaning?

00:08:50.170 --> 00:08:52.750 align:middle line:84%
Or shall we see this
within the context

00:08:52.750 --> 00:08:57.555 align:middle line:84%
of the indigenous stories of how
there will be signs in the sky,

00:08:57.555 --> 00:08:58.930 align:middle line:84%
particularly of
what is sometimes

00:08:58.930 --> 00:09:03.250 align:middle line:84%
called in the astric cosmology
of the spotter woman that

00:09:03.250 --> 00:09:06.100 align:middle line:84%
appears, that casts
a net in the heavens

00:09:06.100 --> 00:09:09.040 align:middle line:84%
as to the change of the upper
and lower layers of the cosmos.

00:09:09.040 --> 00:09:11.890 align:middle line:84%
>>DESIREE HURTAK: And to get
to know the universe around us,

00:09:11.890 --> 00:09:14.980 align:middle line:84%
Dr. [INAUDIBLE] and I
work extensively in Egypt.

00:09:14.980 --> 00:09:19.480 align:middle line:84%
And his book "The Keys of Enoch"
talked about, in the 1970s,

00:09:19.480 --> 00:09:21.580 align:middle line:84%
about how the
pyramid was aligned

00:09:21.580 --> 00:09:25.370 align:middle line:84%
to Orion on one side and the
circumpolar stars on the other.

00:09:25.370 --> 00:09:26.870 align:middle line:84%
We're going to see
that in a minute.

00:09:26.870 --> 00:09:28.570 align:middle line:84%
But I just want to
introduce you also

00:09:28.570 --> 00:09:31.390 align:middle line:84%
to our latest book, which
is called "Giza's Industrial

00:09:31.390 --> 00:09:33.730 align:middle line:84%
Complex," that
talks about the fact

00:09:33.730 --> 00:09:36.670 align:middle line:84%
that we believe the
ancient Egyptians who

00:09:36.670 --> 00:09:41.440 align:middle line:84%
built this humongous, massive
monument which really we

00:09:41.440 --> 00:09:42.550 align:middle line:90%
can hardly do today--

00:09:42.550 --> 00:09:44.620 align:middle line:90%
I believe we cannot do it today.

00:09:44.620 --> 00:09:46.330 align:middle line:84%
You can put stone
upon stone, but you

00:09:46.330 --> 00:09:48.670 align:middle line:84%
can't put all the air
shafts and everything else

00:09:48.670 --> 00:09:50.760 align:middle line:90%
in the way they had done it.

00:09:50.760 --> 00:09:54.160 align:middle line:84%
But that they used a
hydrogen energy technology,

00:09:54.160 --> 00:09:57.400 align:middle line:84%
even a Brown's gas
or oxyhydrogen.

00:09:57.400 --> 00:10:00.310 align:middle line:84%
And this is something if
we would use it today,

00:10:00.310 --> 00:10:03.680 align:middle line:84%
we would actually be able to
help this planet tremendously.

00:10:03.680 --> 00:10:05.135 align:middle line:90%
So that's part of our work.

00:10:05.135 --> 00:10:07.385 align:middle line:84%
>>JJ HURTAK: So this is our
new book that show of what

00:10:07.385 --> 00:10:10.600 align:middle line:84%
is under the pyramid, the
other side of the Egypt story,

00:10:10.600 --> 00:10:14.350 align:middle line:84%
where we were able to
locate salt water batteries.

00:10:14.350 --> 00:10:16.930 align:middle line:84%
We were able to locate
an underground grid

00:10:16.930 --> 00:10:21.040 align:middle line:84%
system of water canals
that were working basically

00:10:21.040 --> 00:10:23.530 align:middle line:84%
as a functional library,
as well as a battery

00:10:23.530 --> 00:10:26.140 align:middle line:84%
system for collecting
and providing

00:10:26.140 --> 00:10:27.610 align:middle line:84%
the energy source
that was needed

00:10:27.610 --> 00:10:30.040 align:middle line:90%
for underground engineering.

00:10:30.040 --> 00:10:31.750 align:middle line:84%
So again, I'm throwing
this on the screen

00:10:31.750 --> 00:10:35.740 align:middle line:84%
because this was found
through remote viewing.

00:10:35.740 --> 00:10:37.900 align:middle line:84%
Remote viewing has
opened up our past

00:10:37.900 --> 00:10:39.550 align:middle line:84%
and has shown us
that we do not have

00:10:39.550 --> 00:10:42.550 align:middle line:84%
to work with traditional
scientific paradigms

00:10:42.550 --> 00:10:46.070 align:middle line:84%
of heavy technology to find the
sources of early civilization.

00:10:46.070 --> 00:10:46.870 align:middle line:90%
>>STEINFELD: Right.

00:10:46.870 --> 00:10:49.030 align:middle line:90%
And they didn't have--

00:10:49.030 --> 00:10:52.810 align:middle line:90%
these tombs are all done--

00:10:52.810 --> 00:10:54.040 align:middle line:90%
it wasn't done in the dark.

00:10:54.040 --> 00:10:56.440 align:middle line:84%
They had these batteries
that illuminated

00:10:56.440 --> 00:10:58.470 align:middle line:90%
the inside of these shafts.

00:10:58.470 --> 00:11:00.630 align:middle line:90%
There's no torch marks in there.

00:11:00.630 --> 00:11:05.560 align:middle line:84%
Even in those other
hieroglyphic designed tombs,

00:11:05.560 --> 00:11:07.030 align:middle line:90%
there's no torch marks.

00:11:07.030 --> 00:11:09.430 align:middle line:84%
They had some kind
of electrical light

00:11:09.430 --> 00:11:12.670 align:middle line:84%
that illuminated the
inside of these chambers.

00:11:12.670 --> 00:11:13.927 align:middle line:90%
That's a part of this book.

00:11:13.927 --> 00:11:15.760 align:middle line:84%
>>JJ HURTAK: Also, we're
seeing the shafts--

00:11:15.760 --> 00:11:17.050 align:middle line:90%
the star shafts diagram--

00:11:17.050 --> 00:11:19.310 align:middle line:84%
pointing to Orion on one
side and Alpha Draconis

00:11:19.310 --> 00:11:20.110 align:middle line:90%
on the other.

00:11:20.110 --> 00:11:20.350 align:middle line:90%
>>DESIREE HURTAK: Right.

00:11:20.350 --> 00:11:22.142 align:middle line:84%
So if we want to know--
we're talking about

00:11:22.142 --> 00:11:24.580 align:middle line:84%
a multi-dimensional cosmology,
we will get into that

00:11:24.580 --> 00:11:27.320 align:middle line:84%
multi-dimensional,
but in this case--

00:11:27.320 --> 00:11:32.155 align:middle line:84%
who is the important guys on
the other side of this planet.

00:11:32.155 --> 00:11:34.280 align:middle line:84%
Like, in other words, when
you go outside the Milky

00:11:34.280 --> 00:11:35.780 align:middle line:90%
Way, what's important?

00:11:35.780 --> 00:11:41.190 align:middle line:84%
Well, Orion is known in both
the Mayan cosmology as well as

00:11:41.190 --> 00:11:41.990 align:middle line:90%
the Egyptian.

00:11:41.990 --> 00:11:43.850 align:middle line:90%
So it's a key factor.

00:11:43.850 --> 00:11:46.670 align:middle line:10%
Also, the whole idea of Alpha
Draconis and Ursa Minor,

00:11:46.670 --> 00:11:49.850 align:middle line:10%
if you take this to
the Mayan cosmology,

00:11:49.850 --> 00:11:53.510 align:middle line:10%
they say that's part of
our circle relationship

00:11:53.510 --> 00:11:56.060 align:middle line:10%
that we are kind of
spiraling around.

00:11:56.060 --> 00:11:58.280 align:middle line:84%
So in a certain sense,
they're actually saying,

00:11:58.280 --> 00:12:01.370 align:middle line:84%
we need to get beyond
the circumpolar stars.

00:12:01.370 --> 00:12:03.800 align:middle line:84%
We need to get into
the higher star

00:12:03.800 --> 00:12:07.275 align:middle line:84%
systems connected with Orion,
the Pleiades, and Sirius.

00:12:07.275 --> 00:12:09.770 align:middle line:84%
>>JJ HURTAK: So we argue
that the Great Pyramid

00:12:09.770 --> 00:12:12.770 align:middle line:84%
is a chronomonitor, an
astrophysical pyramid

00:12:12.770 --> 00:12:15.740 align:middle line:84%
with star shafts point
precisely at the three stars

00:12:15.740 --> 00:12:19.250 align:middle line:84%
in the Belt of Orion going
back 12,000 years, precisely

00:12:19.250 --> 00:12:22.760 align:middle line:84%
at a distance between
1,300 light years plus.

00:12:22.760 --> 00:12:25.280 align:middle line:84%
That type of engineering
and cosmology

00:12:25.280 --> 00:12:29.360 align:middle line:84%
requires, in my opinion,
several generations of Einstein,

00:12:29.360 --> 00:12:32.990 align:middle line:84%
one after the other, to do
this type of geophysical,

00:12:32.990 --> 00:12:36.030 align:middle line:84%
astrophysical, and biophysical
arrangement, all together.

00:12:36.030 --> 00:12:36.830 align:middle line:90%
>>STEINFELD: Right.

00:12:36.830 --> 00:12:38.040 align:middle line:90%
Let's go back to that slide.

00:12:38.040 --> 00:12:40.760 align:middle line:84%
I just want to show people
this is our local neighborhood,

00:12:40.760 --> 00:12:47.330 align:middle line:90%
Orion, Rigel, Betelgeuse.

00:12:47.330 --> 00:12:48.280 align:middle line:90%
If we're going to be--

00:12:48.280 --> 00:12:51.420 align:middle line:84%
>>DESIREE HURTAK: Well, we're
in the arm of the Orion arm

00:12:51.420 --> 00:12:52.220 align:middle line:90%
of the Milky Way.

00:12:52.220 --> 00:12:54.680 align:middle line:84%
>>STEINFELD: The Orion
Arm-- so the galaxy

00:12:54.680 --> 00:12:58.760 align:middle line:84%
has these arms that circulate
and they go up and down.

00:12:58.760 --> 00:13:00.680 align:middle line:90%
They're not even to the plane.

00:13:00.680 --> 00:13:03.890 align:middle line:84%
So where we see the black
rift within those arms

00:13:03.890 --> 00:13:08.960 align:middle line:84%
is just a different elevation
of the arms at different levels.

00:13:08.960 --> 00:13:12.492 align:middle line:84%
So it spins like a
fan, the whole galaxy.

00:13:12.492 --> 00:13:13.700 align:middle line:90%
And that's what we're seeing.

00:13:13.700 --> 00:13:17.000 align:middle line:84%
So we are positioned
in relationship

00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:18.920 align:middle line:84%
to some of these stars
and these star shafts

00:13:18.920 --> 00:13:21.095 align:middle line:90%
open to these energetic portals.

00:13:21.095 --> 00:13:22.970 align:middle line:84%
>>DESIREE HURTAK: And
we're going to even see

00:13:22.970 --> 00:13:24.710 align:middle line:90%
the real local realm shortly.

00:13:24.710 --> 00:13:26.510 align:middle line:84%
But I just want
to point out, when

00:13:26.510 --> 00:13:28.760 align:middle line:84%
you talk about the
Egyptians, they actually

00:13:28.760 --> 00:13:31.520 align:middle line:84%
had all those different
levels of intelligence.

00:13:31.520 --> 00:13:35.570 align:middle line:84%
So they had the lion face
gods, they had the reptilians--

00:13:35.570 --> 00:13:36.710 align:middle line:90%
you can see that there--

00:13:36.710 --> 00:13:38.360 align:middle line:90%
they had the bird-faced gods.

00:13:38.360 --> 00:13:41.870 align:middle line:84%
Actually, all these types
of intelligences exist.

00:13:41.870 --> 00:13:44.570 align:middle line:84%
And we've shown in some
of our other lectures

00:13:44.570 --> 00:13:46.940 align:middle line:84%
about what these
beings looked like.

00:13:46.940 --> 00:13:50.360 align:middle line:10%
And it's not just all what we
would call the adamic species

00:13:50.360 --> 00:13:51.620 align:middle line:10%
that look like us.

00:13:51.620 --> 00:13:52.830 align:middle line:10%
There's a lot of others.

00:13:52.830 --> 00:13:54.590 align:middle line:10%
It's not just the greys either.

00:13:54.590 --> 00:13:56.680 align:middle line:10%
There's the praying mantis
and many other kinds.

00:13:56.680 --> 00:13:59.670 align:middle line:10%
So the ships-- the solar
boats, so to speak,

00:13:59.670 --> 00:14:00.650 align:middle line:10%
as they were called--

00:14:00.650 --> 00:14:03.330 align:middle line:10%
literally took all
these different beings

00:14:03.330 --> 00:14:04.130 align:middle line:10%
around the galaxy.

00:14:04.130 --> 00:14:04.880 align:middle line:84%
>>JJ HURTAK: So
there was a language

00:14:04.880 --> 00:14:07.310 align:middle line:84%
that went with the
cosmology of the ancients,

00:14:07.310 --> 00:14:10.040 align:middle line:84%
connecting the different
realms and connecting

00:14:10.040 --> 00:14:12.710 align:middle line:84%
the different anthropologists
with the cosmic others.

00:14:12.710 --> 00:14:16.190 align:middle line:10%
We would call them the
hierarchy of those beings that

00:14:16.190 --> 00:14:18.560 align:middle line:10%
are now being released
by governments

00:14:18.560 --> 00:14:19.580 align:middle line:10%
throughout the world.

00:14:19.580 --> 00:14:20.380 align:middle line:10%
>>STEINFELD: Right.

00:14:20.380 --> 00:14:23.870 align:middle line:10%
Many civilizations have
these bird-headed beings.

00:14:23.870 --> 00:14:26.330 align:middle line:84%
That was just part-- it
wasn't just a mythology,

00:14:26.330 --> 00:14:28.983 align:middle line:84%
it was actually a visitation
of different intelligences.

00:14:28.983 --> 00:14:30.650 align:middle line:84%
>>DESIREE HURTAK: And
they could give us

00:14:30.650 --> 00:14:32.723 align:middle line:90%
information about the cosmos.

00:14:32.723 --> 00:14:33.640 align:middle line:10%
So even Quetzalcoatl--

00:14:33.640 --> 00:14:35.870 align:middle line:10%
>>JJ HURTAK: Those five
levels of geometry,

00:14:35.870 --> 00:14:40.340 align:middle line:10%
if I can just emphasize this,
represent the use of higher

00:14:40.340 --> 00:14:43.505 align:middle line:10%
protocommunication
signals between the higher

00:14:43.505 --> 00:14:45.755 align:middle line:10%
intelligence-- we will call
it the higher evolutionary

00:14:45.755 --> 00:14:48.320 align:middle line:10%
intelligence-- and
human recipients,

00:14:48.320 --> 00:14:51.470 align:middle line:10%
personified by the woman on
the lower-right receiving five

00:14:51.470 --> 00:14:53.870 align:middle line:10%
levels of mantric teaching--

00:14:53.870 --> 00:14:56.000 align:middle line:10%
acoustical, physical
signals being

00:14:56.000 --> 00:15:00.410 align:middle line:10%
used in a variety of ways for
mantras, divine utterances,

00:15:00.410 --> 00:15:03.050 align:middle line:10%
inspired language
of the divine names

00:15:03.050 --> 00:15:04.842 align:middle line:10%
and five different
levels of communication.

00:15:04.842 --> 00:15:06.758 align:middle line:10%
>>DESIREE HURTAK: So
let's take a look at some

00:15:06.758 --> 00:15:08.000 align:middle line:10%
of these other intelligences.

00:15:08.000 --> 00:15:09.830 align:middle line:10%
We talked about the grays.

00:15:09.830 --> 00:15:12.290 align:middle line:10%
This is an illustration Dr.
Hurtak and I put together.

00:15:12.290 --> 00:15:13.790 align:middle line:10%
>>JJ HURTAK: This
is what I released

00:15:13.790 --> 00:15:16.970 align:middle line:10%
during the US government's
first disclosure, 1996.

00:15:16.970 --> 00:15:20.570 align:middle line:10%
This is an actual diagram
made by a top artist working

00:15:20.570 --> 00:15:22.363 align:middle line:10%
with me of beings that
were seen in Africa.

00:15:22.363 --> 00:15:23.780 align:middle line:10%
>>DESIREE HURTAK:
And then there's

00:15:23.780 --> 00:15:25.340 align:middle line:10%
also the reptilian forms.

00:15:25.340 --> 00:15:27.720 align:middle line:10%
And they don't always
have to be negative,

00:15:27.720 --> 00:15:29.240 align:middle line:10%
but they are different from us.

00:15:29.240 --> 00:15:32.480 align:middle line:90%
So they don't have the--

00:15:32.480 --> 00:15:33.800 align:middle line:90%
>>JJ HURTAK: Mental capacity.

00:15:33.800 --> 00:15:36.380 align:middle line:84%
>>DESIREE HURTAK: Or also the
capability of sharing with us,

00:15:36.380 --> 00:15:37.430 align:middle line:90%
as others.

00:15:37.430 --> 00:15:38.860 align:middle line:90%
But I like this one better.

00:15:38.860 --> 00:15:39.860 align:middle line:90%
>>STEINFELD: Oh, thanks.

00:15:39.860 --> 00:15:41.000 align:middle line:90%
That's me.

00:15:41.000 --> 00:15:42.450 align:middle line:90%
That's me as an ET.

00:15:42.450 --> 00:15:43.250 align:middle line:90%
Can you see it.

00:15:43.250 --> 00:15:46.370 align:middle line:90%
That's my ET connections there.

00:15:46.370 --> 00:15:47.280 align:middle line:90%
All right.

00:15:47.280 --> 00:15:48.080 align:middle line:90%
Enough.

00:15:48.080 --> 00:15:49.210 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:15:49.210 --> 00:15:51.030 align:middle line:90%
Occasionally I go into that.

00:15:51.030 --> 00:15:51.830 align:middle line:90%
Thanks.

00:15:51.830 --> 00:15:52.220 align:middle line:90%
Thanks for watching.

00:15:52.220 --> 00:15:54.012 align:middle line:84%
>>JJ HURTAK: But humans
can be transceivers

00:15:54.012 --> 00:15:55.040 align:middle line:90%
of higher consciousness.

00:15:55.040 --> 00:15:56.690 align:middle line:84%
And this is the
great work that's

00:15:56.690 --> 00:16:00.020 align:middle line:84%
been done behind the scenes at
Stanford Research Institute.

00:16:00.020 --> 00:16:02.690 align:middle line:84%
At Princeton University,
they acknowledge the fact

00:16:02.690 --> 00:16:04.430 align:middle line:84%
that there are
untapped powers that

00:16:04.430 --> 00:16:08.300 align:middle line:84%
make us cosmic citizens and
pioneers of a living universe.

00:16:08.300 --> 00:16:12.050 align:middle line:84%
>>STEINFELD: And I do think we
could stretch our consciousness

00:16:12.050 --> 00:16:14.240 align:middle line:90%
so we can call in these beings.

00:16:14.240 --> 00:16:15.690 align:middle line:90%
They actually are right here.

00:16:15.690 --> 00:16:17.780 align:middle line:90%
They really are not separate.

00:16:17.780 --> 00:16:22.310 align:middle line:84%
They're part of just a slightly
different vibration of reality.

00:16:22.310 --> 00:16:25.820 align:middle line:84%
But we can open up
to that and start--

00:16:25.820 --> 00:16:27.870 align:middle line:84%
I mean, lots of people
channeling and stuff.

00:16:27.870 --> 00:16:30.920 align:middle line:84%
There are people getting
information downloads.

00:16:30.920 --> 00:16:34.480 align:middle line:84%
Creative downloads-- if you talk
to an artist or a songwriter,

00:16:34.480 --> 00:16:37.010 align:middle line:84%
they say, I don't know
where this stuff comes from.

00:16:37.010 --> 00:16:38.690 align:middle line:90%
Well, maybe this is where.

00:16:38.690 --> 00:16:40.100 align:middle line:90%
They're bringing in this--

00:16:40.100 --> 00:16:42.710 align:middle line:84%
we're bringing in this
knowledge through this vehicle

00:16:42.710 --> 00:16:45.100 align:middle line:84%
to deliver and
uplift this planet.

00:16:45.100 --> 00:16:46.017 align:middle line:90%
That's why we're here.

00:16:46.017 --> 00:16:47.517 align:middle line:84%
>>DESIREE HURTAK:
And some of beings

00:16:47.517 --> 00:16:50.030 align:middle line:84%
are not only in the third
dimension or the fourth, which

00:16:50.030 --> 00:16:52.880 align:middle line:84%
is time, according to Einstein,
but they're also operating

00:16:52.880 --> 00:16:54.200 align:middle line:90%
in the fifth dimension.

00:16:54.200 --> 00:16:56.150 align:middle line:84%
And then even those
that are beyond.

00:16:56.150 --> 00:16:57.950 align:middle line:84%
We'll get to the
beyond, but first we

00:16:57.950 --> 00:17:00.080 align:middle line:84%
want to point out a
very good friend of ours

00:17:00.080 --> 00:17:02.780 align:middle line:84%
from South Africa who's
named Elizabeth Klarer.

00:17:02.780 --> 00:17:05.030 align:middle line:84%
And when she was riding
a horse in the mountains

00:17:05.030 --> 00:17:06.045 align:middle line:90%
of the Drakgensberg--

00:17:06.045 --> 00:17:07.160 align:middle line:90%
>>JJ HURTAK: Drakensberg.

00:17:07.160 --> 00:17:09.650 align:middle line:10%
>>DESIREE HURTAK: --she
actually encountered this being,

00:17:09.650 --> 00:17:11.480 align:middle line:10%
which she made a bust of.

00:17:11.480 --> 00:17:13.069 align:middle line:10%
And he was just like her.

00:17:13.069 --> 00:17:15.150 align:middle line:10%
It was, like, really
no difference.

00:17:15.150 --> 00:17:18.310 align:middle line:10%
And she did this in the 1950s.

00:17:18.310 --> 00:17:20.569 align:middle line:10%
And there's a whole
story about this.

00:17:20.569 --> 00:17:23.150 align:middle line:10%
She's written a book called
"Beyond the Light Barrier."

00:17:23.150 --> 00:17:29.750 align:middle line:84%
And she says that basically
they had bases in Antarctica.

00:17:29.750 --> 00:17:31.610 align:middle line:84%
So that's something
that's coming out now,

00:17:31.610 --> 00:17:34.580 align:middle line:84%
but she said it in the '50s,
wrote about it in the '70s.

00:17:34.580 --> 00:17:35.900 align:middle line:90%
And this is what he told her--

00:17:35.900 --> 00:17:39.260 align:middle line:84%
she actually went with
him to his planet.

00:17:39.260 --> 00:17:41.370 align:middle line:84%
And his planet happened
to be Alpha Centauri.

00:17:41.370 --> 00:17:42.170 align:middle line:90%
>>STEINFELD: Wait.

00:17:42.170 --> 00:17:46.490 align:middle line:84%
The good part is she had a child
with this extraterrestrial.

00:17:46.490 --> 00:17:47.300 align:middle line:90%
No really.

00:17:47.300 --> 00:17:47.960 align:middle line:90%
I'm not making that up.

00:17:47.960 --> 00:17:48.290 align:middle line:90%
>>DESIREE HURTAK: No, she did.

00:17:48.290 --> 00:17:49.950 align:middle line:90%
That's what she's known for.

00:17:49.950 --> 00:17:51.650 align:middle line:84%
>>STEINFELD: JJ met--
you both met her.

00:17:51.650 --> 00:17:52.050 align:middle line:90%
>>JJ HURTAK: That's right.

00:17:52.050 --> 00:17:52.990 align:middle line:84%
>>DESIREE HURTAK: Yeah,
I took the picture.

00:17:52.990 --> 00:17:53.390 align:middle line:90%
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:17:53.390 --> 00:17:55.723 align:middle line:84%
>>JJ HURTAK: She lectured
before the British parliament.

00:17:55.723 --> 00:17:57.690 align:middle line:84%
She lectured before
German scientists.

00:17:57.690 --> 00:18:01.610 align:middle line:84%
And I saw the notes that she was
visited by Russian scientists,

00:18:01.610 --> 00:18:02.730 align:middle line:90%
American scientists.

00:18:02.730 --> 00:18:04.500 align:middle line:90%
Of course, she was off the map.

00:18:04.500 --> 00:18:08.810 align:middle line:84%
The MUFON people consider this
was complete science fiction,

00:18:08.810 --> 00:18:11.570 align:middle line:84%
but nonetheless a woman of her
background and intelligence

00:18:11.570 --> 00:18:14.630 align:middle line:84%
could not have come up with
the high math equations

00:18:14.630 --> 00:18:17.240 align:middle line:84%
that I saw that were then passed
on to British intelligence.

00:18:17.240 --> 00:18:18.320 align:middle line:84%
>>DESIREE HURTAK: Well,
what's important is

00:18:18.320 --> 00:18:20.610 align:middle line:84%
he said that his civilization
had lived on this planet

00:18:20.610 --> 00:18:21.410 align:middle line:90%
before.

00:18:21.410 --> 00:18:23.060 align:middle line:84%
Now we're already
finding civilizations

00:18:23.060 --> 00:18:24.410 align:middle line:90%
that are really quite old--

00:18:24.410 --> 00:18:27.770 align:middle line:84%
that our planet was having
a major solar flares

00:18:27.770 --> 00:18:28.760 align:middle line:90%
and problems.

00:18:28.760 --> 00:18:32.030 align:middle line:84%
They initially went
underground into the Antarctic.

00:18:32.030 --> 00:18:34.520 align:middle line:84%
and when that got to be a
little bit too much for them,

00:18:34.520 --> 00:18:38.780 align:middle line:84%
because they're basically a
surface civilization, like us.

00:18:38.780 --> 00:18:41.540 align:middle line:84%
Obviously, they had
enough cap capability--

00:18:41.540 --> 00:18:43.610 align:middle line:90%
she had a child with him--

00:18:43.610 --> 00:18:45.500 align:middle line:84%
that they moved to
the nearest star.

00:18:45.500 --> 00:18:49.100 align:middle line:10%
Now, in the '50s no one
knew the nearest star.

00:18:49.100 --> 00:18:51.500 align:middle line:10%
They always thought
maybe, actually,

00:18:51.500 --> 00:18:53.810 align:middle line:10%
Barnard's Star was
supposedly the nearest star.

00:18:53.810 --> 00:18:56.030 align:middle line:84%
The brighter star
was always closer.

00:18:56.030 --> 00:18:56.850 align:middle line:90%
That's not true.

00:18:56.850 --> 00:19:01.760 align:middle line:84%
Now we know from different
types of red analysis

00:19:01.760 --> 00:19:05.150 align:middle line:84%
that Alpha Centauri,
which is exactly where he

00:19:05.150 --> 00:19:08.210 align:middle line:84%
said he was from,
the nearest star,

00:19:08.210 --> 00:19:09.768 align:middle line:90%
is the closest star to us.

00:19:09.768 --> 00:19:11.810 align:middle line:84%
We have the Oort Cloud,
we have two light years--

00:19:11.810 --> 00:19:13.100 align:middle line:90%
they haven't seen anything.

00:19:13.100 --> 00:19:16.590 align:middle line:84%
You have to go four light
years to see the Centauri Alpha

00:19:16.590 --> 00:19:17.390 align:middle line:90%
and Proxima.

00:19:17.390 --> 00:19:20.780 align:middle line:84%
That's supposedly where
this being came from.

00:19:20.780 --> 00:19:21.890 align:middle line:90%
And his name is--

00:19:21.890 --> 00:19:23.360 align:middle line:90%
>>JJ HURTAK: Akon.

00:19:23.360 --> 00:19:26.540 align:middle line:10%
>>DESIREE HURTAK: And he's
from Meton, a planet circling

00:19:26.540 --> 00:19:27.420 align:middle line:10%
Alpha Centauri.

00:19:27.420 --> 00:19:28.795 align:middle line:10%
>>JJ HURTAK: Now,
the name Meton,

00:19:28.795 --> 00:19:31.220 align:middle line:10%
I had written in 1973
in "The Keys of Enoch,"

00:19:31.220 --> 00:19:34.850 align:middle line:10%
which was based upon a
paraphysical experience I had--

00:19:34.850 --> 00:19:36.470 align:middle line:10%
we'll get more to
this later, this

00:19:36.470 --> 00:19:39.400 align:middle line:10%
is the codebook of
cosmology and consciousness,

00:19:39.400 --> 00:19:41.300 align:middle line:10%
of how they work together--

00:19:41.300 --> 00:19:45.230 align:middle line:10%
but Meton was a
buzzword that stood out

00:19:45.230 --> 00:19:47.630 align:middle line:10%
in the mind of Elizabeth Klarer.

00:19:47.630 --> 00:19:51.260 align:middle line:10%
I did not know that her contact
experience dealt with Meton.

00:19:51.260 --> 00:19:53.660 align:middle line:10%
And so when we met
at the University

00:19:53.660 --> 00:19:57.410 align:middle line:10%
in Johannesburg, South Africa,
certain things came together.

00:19:57.410 --> 00:20:00.530 align:middle line:10%
And we had the
opportunity to explore

00:20:00.530 --> 00:20:02.570 align:middle line:10%
why she had so
much information--

00:20:02.570 --> 00:20:05.570 align:middle line:10%
cosmic astrophysical
information-- downloaded.

00:20:05.570 --> 00:20:08.008 align:middle line:10%
She was a humanist.

00:20:08.008 --> 00:20:09.050 align:middle line:10%
She worked with the Zulu.

00:20:09.050 --> 00:20:12.980 align:middle line:10%
She was aware of
the ability of mind

00:20:12.980 --> 00:20:15.110 align:middle line:10%
over matter that some
individuals have.

00:20:15.110 --> 00:20:17.240 align:middle line:10%
And through her,
was a recognition

00:20:17.240 --> 00:20:21.200 align:middle line:10%
that a star map, very much
like Betty and Barney Hill,

00:20:21.200 --> 00:20:23.268 align:middle line:10%
had to be given to
those in authority.

00:20:23.268 --> 00:20:24.560 align:middle line:10%
>>STEINFELD: Where's her child?

00:20:24.560 --> 00:20:25.140 align:middle line:90%
Where's her ET?

00:20:25.140 --> 00:20:26.540 align:middle line:84%
>>DESIREE HURTAK: Actually,
he stayed on that planet.

00:20:26.540 --> 00:20:29.130 align:middle line:84%
Supposedly, the heart rate
vibrations are different,

00:20:29.130 --> 00:20:32.870 align:middle line:84%
and it's hard to live going
back and forth like we do,

00:20:32.870 --> 00:20:34.110 align:middle line:90%
East Coast, West Coast.

00:20:34.110 --> 00:20:35.960 align:middle line:84%
There's a whole different
heart vibration.

00:20:35.960 --> 00:20:37.460 align:middle line:84%
And they said if
she stayed longer--

00:20:37.460 --> 00:20:40.340 align:middle line:84%
I think she stayed
four months there--

00:20:40.340 --> 00:20:41.960 align:middle line:84%
her heart rate would
be too difficult

00:20:41.960 --> 00:20:44.510 align:middle line:90%
for her to come back here.

00:20:44.510 --> 00:20:46.910 align:middle line:84%
So speaking of Betty
and Barney Hill,

00:20:46.910 --> 00:20:48.540 align:middle line:84%
I think Alan went
to this location.

00:20:48.540 --> 00:20:49.280 align:middle line:90%
>>STEINFELD: Well, yeah.

00:20:49.280 --> 00:20:50.530 align:middle line:90%
This has Betty in Barney Hill.

00:20:50.530 --> 00:20:52.807 align:middle line:84%
They were the first
real abductees.

00:20:52.807 --> 00:20:54.140 align:middle line:90%
They were an interracial couple.

00:20:54.140 --> 00:20:58.880 align:middle line:84%
They were driving along the
road in 1961 in New Hampshire.

00:20:58.880 --> 00:21:02.900 align:middle line:84%
And they see lights in the
sky, and it's late at night--

00:21:02.900 --> 00:21:04.580 align:middle line:90%
it's like 12:00 midnight.

00:21:04.580 --> 00:21:08.198 align:middle line:84%
And then, suddenly,
they've lost four hours.

00:21:08.198 --> 00:21:09.740 align:middle line:84%
They don't know what
happens to them.

00:21:09.740 --> 00:21:14.120 align:middle line:84%
They're regressed by this
trauma therapist really, who

00:21:14.120 --> 00:21:16.160 align:middle line:90%
used to work with war veterans.

00:21:16.160 --> 00:21:18.710 align:middle line:84%
And he said, he's
never seen people

00:21:18.710 --> 00:21:21.290 align:middle line:84%
more traumatized than
Betty and Barney Hill.

00:21:21.290 --> 00:21:23.795 align:middle line:84%
And they said they didn't
know what happened.

00:21:23.795 --> 00:21:25.690 align:middle line:84%
So they start to
have nightmares.

00:21:25.690 --> 00:21:28.620 align:middle line:84%
So they went to see
this guy, Benjamin--

00:21:28.620 --> 00:21:29.790 align:middle line:90%
>>JJ HURTAK: Benjamin Simon.

00:21:29.790 --> 00:21:32.490 align:middle line:84%
>>STEINFELD: --Simon,
and Betty and Barney

00:21:32.490 --> 00:21:35.160 align:middle line:84%
were both regressed,
because they

00:21:35.160 --> 00:21:37.780 align:middle line:84%
were getting very stressed out
from the trauma they didn't

00:21:37.780 --> 00:21:38.580 align:middle line:90%
realize.

00:21:38.580 --> 00:21:41.190 align:middle line:84%
And Betty remembers,
in her regression,

00:21:41.190 --> 00:21:44.610 align:middle line:84%
seeing a map on the
wall of this ship

00:21:44.610 --> 00:21:47.400 align:middle line:84%
that they were taken
aboard, and they were just

00:21:47.400 --> 00:21:49.690 align:middle line:90%
these dots in the sky.

00:21:49.690 --> 00:21:53.250 align:middle line:84%
And the ET on the ship,
she asked, what's that?

00:21:53.250 --> 00:21:54.450 align:middle line:90%
She said, that's a star map.

00:21:54.450 --> 00:21:56.490 align:middle line:90%
There were no names like this.

00:21:56.490 --> 00:21:58.620 align:middle line:84%
But there was a woman
named Marjorie Fish,

00:21:58.620 --> 00:22:00.270 align:middle line:90%
who was an astronomer.

00:22:00.270 --> 00:22:03.240 align:middle line:84%
She was making
three-dimensional star maps.

00:22:03.240 --> 00:22:07.920 align:middle line:84%
Betty Hill described the
position of the stars

00:22:07.920 --> 00:22:11.790 align:middle line:84%
that she saw on the
ship, and Marjorie Fish

00:22:11.790 --> 00:22:13.800 align:middle line:90%
was able to label them.

00:22:13.800 --> 00:22:17.160 align:middle line:84%
And when she asked the ETs
which star they came from,

00:22:17.160 --> 00:22:19.290 align:middle line:90%
he pointed to Zeta Reticuli.

00:22:19.290 --> 00:22:21.900 align:middle line:84%
So Zetas, is what
they're called--

00:22:21.900 --> 00:22:24.690 align:middle line:84%
all come from Betty's
identification

00:22:24.690 --> 00:22:28.515 align:middle line:84%
of a star map with Zeta Reticuli
and the location of the ETs

00:22:28.515 --> 00:22:30.390 align:middle line:84%
>>JJ HURTAK: And you
can see the lower facial

00:22:30.390 --> 00:22:32.250 align:middle line:84%
or prosopographic
features in the lower

00:22:32.250 --> 00:22:34.167 align:middle line:84%
left, drawn by artists
working with the Hills.

00:22:34.167 --> 00:22:35.542 align:middle line:84%
>>DESIREE HURTAK:
They're kind of

00:22:35.542 --> 00:22:37.800 align:middle line:84%
like the grays in a certain
sense, although maybe

00:22:37.800 --> 00:22:41.550 align:middle line:84%
not the large eyes that we're
used to or that Alan had.

00:22:41.550 --> 00:22:45.570 align:middle line:84%
>>JJ HURTAK: But they do match
what we found in South Africa

00:22:45.570 --> 00:22:47.760 align:middle line:90%
in the drawings of Zulu shamans.

00:22:47.760 --> 00:22:50.130 align:middle line:10%
They also match
those that we see

00:22:50.130 --> 00:22:53.280 align:middle line:10%
in portraits from the
indigenous heritage

00:22:53.280 --> 00:22:57.460 align:middle line:10%
of the islands of Australia
and around New Zealand.

00:22:57.460 --> 00:22:59.820 align:middle line:10%
>>DESIREE HURTAK: But this
was really their local travel

00:22:59.820 --> 00:23:00.732 align:middle line:10%
guide so to speak.

00:23:00.732 --> 00:23:02.190 align:middle line:10%
So they went from
the sun, which is

00:23:02.190 --> 00:23:04.680 align:middle line:10%
close to Sirius,
to Zeta Reticuli,

00:23:04.680 --> 00:23:06.330 align:middle line:10%
to Eridandi, to Tau Ceti.

00:23:06.330 --> 00:23:08.232 align:middle line:84%
This is the local
place that they

00:23:08.232 --> 00:23:09.440 align:middle line:90%
would go visit and go around.

00:23:09.440 --> 00:23:12.630 align:middle line:84%
>>JJ HURTAK: A complex
star map from a person,

00:23:12.630 --> 00:23:14.280 align:middle line:84%
an average person
who did not have

00:23:14.280 --> 00:23:16.260 align:middle line:90%
this astrophysical knowledge.

00:23:16.260 --> 00:23:18.240 align:middle line:84%
And yet, it was
downloaded into her.

00:23:18.240 --> 00:23:19.740 align:middle line:84%
>>STEINFELD: And,
of course, there's

00:23:19.740 --> 00:23:21.190 align:middle line:90%
life throughout the universe.

00:23:21.190 --> 00:23:24.300 align:middle line:84%
I mean they every
single spot has life.

00:23:24.300 --> 00:23:26.600 align:middle line:90%
This is our local neighbors.

00:23:26.600 --> 00:23:27.748 align:middle line:90%
This is right where we are.

00:23:27.748 --> 00:23:29.790 align:middle line:84%
>>DESIREE HURTAK: So we're
recapping what we just

00:23:29.790 --> 00:23:33.060 align:middle line:84%
showed you, just so you kind of
know who's living around you.

00:23:33.060 --> 00:23:36.540 align:middle line:84%
Alpha Centauri, which
is where Meton was,

00:23:36.540 --> 00:23:40.650 align:middle line:84%
the planet, Arcon, Tau
Ceti, connected with Betty

00:23:40.650 --> 00:23:44.520 align:middle line:84%
and Barney Hill, Sirius,
something that also the Great

00:23:44.520 --> 00:23:46.600 align:middle line:84%
Pyramid points to
right over here,

00:23:46.600 --> 00:23:48.592 align:middle line:84%
and then Arcturus-- we
didn't talk about that,

00:23:48.592 --> 00:23:49.800 align:middle line:90%
but we're going to show that.

00:23:49.800 --> 00:23:53.880 align:middle line:10%
So basically, this is
all the local beings

00:23:53.880 --> 00:23:54.870 align:middle line:10%
that are around here.

00:23:54.870 --> 00:23:57.930 align:middle line:10%
So we're showing, as we grow
up and people want disclosure,

00:23:57.930 --> 00:24:00.303 align:middle line:10%
well, how about knowing who's
there-- who's out there.

00:24:00.303 --> 00:24:02.220 align:middle line:84%
>>STEINFELD: Who's in
our neighborhood, what's

00:24:02.220 --> 00:24:03.020 align:middle line:90%
down the block.

00:24:03.020 --> 00:24:04.980 align:middle line:84%
Well, Sirius, though,
a lot of Egyptians

00:24:04.980 --> 00:24:08.000 align:middle line:84%
think we actually were
seeded by the Sirians.

00:24:08.000 --> 00:24:10.530 align:middle line:84%
Sirians is another
name for Osiris.

00:24:10.530 --> 00:24:13.440 align:middle line:84%
So that's really
the Osirian Star.

00:24:13.440 --> 00:24:18.960 align:middle line:84%
So that's maybe-- some people
say the whole local universe

00:24:18.960 --> 00:24:20.790 align:middle line:90%
revolves around Sirius.

00:24:20.790 --> 00:24:24.390 align:middle line:84%
We're not far enough
out to really understand

00:24:24.390 --> 00:24:27.780 align:middle line:84%
where we're rotating around,
but there are circles

00:24:27.780 --> 00:24:30.090 align:middle line:90%
within circles within circles.

00:24:30.090 --> 00:24:32.118 align:middle line:84%
>>JJ HURTAK: We are a
part of a neighborhood.

00:24:32.118 --> 00:24:33.660 align:middle line:84%
And the good news
is the neighborhood

00:24:33.660 --> 00:24:36.780 align:middle line:84%
is responding to the signals
that the indigenous are

00:24:36.780 --> 00:24:39.000 align:middle line:84%
putting out in the space,
that they need help.

00:24:39.000 --> 00:24:40.030 align:middle line:90%
Mother Earth is crying.

00:24:40.030 --> 00:24:40.830 align:middle line:90%
>>STEINFELD: Right.

00:24:40.830 --> 00:24:42.683 align:middle line:84%
We're in a good
neighborhood, OK?

00:24:42.683 --> 00:24:43.510 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:24:43.510 --> 00:24:44.927 align:middle line:84%
>>JJ HURTAK: And
what is happening

00:24:44.927 --> 00:24:46.950 align:middle line:84%
is many of these ships
that are being seen

00:24:46.950 --> 00:24:49.282 align:middle line:90%
are over those danger areas.

00:24:49.282 --> 00:24:50.490 align:middle line:90%
The nuclear weapons systems--

00:24:50.490 --> 00:24:53.010 align:middle line:84%
in our opinion,
the danger points

00:24:53.010 --> 00:24:57.120 align:middle line:84%
that have to be
revisited and understood,

00:24:57.120 --> 00:24:59.430 align:middle line:90%
representing our participation.

00:24:59.430 --> 00:25:01.710 align:middle line:84%
>>STEINFELD: Well, because
it's like a living matrix.

00:25:01.710 --> 00:25:02.910 align:middle line:90%
We're not separate.

00:25:02.910 --> 00:25:04.410 align:middle line:90%
This is a whole matrix.

00:25:04.410 --> 00:25:06.440 align:middle line:84%
We're all connected
to each other.

00:25:06.440 --> 00:25:09.990 align:middle line:84%
So if you have a problem
in your little toe,

00:25:09.990 --> 00:25:13.350 align:middle line:84%
the whole body feels it,
especially if it's a severe

00:25:13.350 --> 00:25:15.780 align:middle line:84%
you know meltdown
that's happening

00:25:15.780 --> 00:25:17.900 align:middle line:90%
in one part of your system.

00:25:17.900 --> 00:25:21.150 align:middle line:84%
It's like, they're going to
come and say, what's going on?

00:25:21.150 --> 00:25:23.860 align:middle line:84%
Get that splinter out
of your toe there!

00:25:23.860 --> 00:25:24.660 align:middle line:90%
You know?

00:25:24.660 --> 00:25:25.980 align:middle line:90%
Because you can't sleep.

00:25:25.980 --> 00:25:28.480 align:middle line:84%
So we're disturbing
all our neighbors.

00:25:28.480 --> 00:25:29.280 align:middle line:90%
Really.

00:25:29.280 --> 00:25:30.810 align:middle line:84%
>>DESIREE HURTAK: Just to
show you, here's the sun.

00:25:30.810 --> 00:25:32.477 align:middle line:84%
And sun is usually
placed at the center,

00:25:32.477 --> 00:25:34.510 align:middle line:84%
because that's how we're
viewing everything.

00:25:34.510 --> 00:25:35.310 align:middle line:90%
So yes.

00:25:35.310 --> 00:25:37.422 align:middle line:84%
And Arcturus, I want
to point that out.

00:25:37.422 --> 00:25:38.880 align:middle line:84%
We're going to take
a look at that.

00:25:38.880 --> 00:25:40.320 align:middle line:84%
Because it's
actually interesting,

00:25:40.320 --> 00:25:43.110 align:middle line:84%
Dr. Hurtak, in the
"Keys of Enoch" book,

00:25:43.110 --> 00:25:46.230 align:middle line:84%
says that it's connected
with the high command

00:25:46.230 --> 00:25:49.320 align:middle line:84%
intelligence working
with our solar system

00:25:49.320 --> 00:25:53.580 align:middle line:84%
through the midway station of
Arcturus, which opens the lower

00:25:53.580 --> 00:25:56.130 align:middle line:84%
heavens or the local
heavens, allowing

00:25:56.130 --> 00:25:59.760 align:middle line:84%
the local heavens to move into
alignment with the true star

00:25:59.760 --> 00:26:00.840 align:middle line:90%
pointer of the Pleiades.

00:26:00.840 --> 00:26:02.790 align:middle line:90%
So it's kind of an alignment.

00:26:02.790 --> 00:26:05.010 align:middle line:84%
We all kind of know
about alignments.

00:26:05.010 --> 00:26:07.700 align:middle line:84%
And as we work with
Arcturus, we're

00:26:07.700 --> 00:26:11.490 align:middle line:84%
starting to align with
different intelligences that

00:26:11.490 --> 00:26:15.000 align:middle line:84%
then connect us to the
Pleiades, connect us to Orion,

00:26:15.000 --> 00:26:16.930 align:middle line:84%
connect us with
other star system.

00:26:16.930 --> 00:26:19.470 align:middle line:84%
>>STEINFELD: I also want to
say what Dr. Hurtak is saying,

00:26:19.470 --> 00:26:21.900 align:middle line:84%
as he says in his book
"The Keys of Enoch,"

00:26:21.900 --> 00:26:24.720 align:middle line:84%
is that there's levels
of intelligences

00:26:24.720 --> 00:26:28.740 align:middle line:84%
and dimensional realities as you
reach into these other stars.

00:26:28.740 --> 00:26:31.610 align:middle line:84%
So everything's not
just 3D physical

00:26:31.610 --> 00:26:33.320 align:middle line:84%
like we think it
is here on Earth,

00:26:33.320 --> 00:26:36.510 align:middle line:84%
but there's slightly
different vibrations

00:26:36.510 --> 00:26:40.680 align:middle line:84%
of spiritual energies that
exist in these other realms.

00:26:40.680 --> 00:26:43.490 align:middle line:84%
And it's not just a matter of
going there, but going there

00:26:43.490 --> 00:26:44.610 align:middle line:90%
in consciousness.

00:26:44.610 --> 00:26:45.560 align:middle line:90%
And that's the work,

00:26:45.560 --> 00:26:47.143 align:middle line:84%
>>JJ HURTAK: I was
visited by a member

00:26:47.143 --> 00:26:48.830 align:middle line:84%
of the British
parliament in 1973,

00:26:48.830 --> 00:26:53.180 align:middle line:84%
and he was concerned, why
did I pick out Arcturus?

00:26:53.180 --> 00:26:55.415 align:middle line:84%
And I said, this was
shown me in my experience,

00:26:55.415 --> 00:26:58.028 align:middle line:84%
that Arcturus would be a star
key-- one of the first areas.

00:26:58.028 --> 00:27:00.320 align:middle line:10%
And he said, did you know
that the Scottish and British

00:27:00.320 --> 00:27:04.940 align:middle line:10%
astronomers had validated
communication symbols

00:27:04.940 --> 00:27:07.595 align:middle line:10%
from that area of
our local heaven?

00:27:07.595 --> 00:27:08.970 align:middle line:10%
>>DESIREE HURTAK:
So let's go on.

00:27:08.970 --> 00:27:10.820 align:middle line:10%
There's something
that Alan and us,

00:27:10.820 --> 00:27:13.880 align:middle line:10%
if you've ever gone to Contact
in the Desert, basically,

00:27:13.880 --> 00:27:15.860 align:middle line:10%
we oftentimes-- we
can't do it this year,

00:27:15.860 --> 00:27:19.430 align:middle line:10%
because they're doing
some changes with it--

00:27:19.430 --> 00:27:22.910 align:middle line:10%
usually we rent a time
with the Integratron

00:27:22.910 --> 00:27:25.940 align:middle line:10%
and do a special
meditation there.

00:27:25.940 --> 00:27:27.590 align:middle line:84%
Because we actually
personally knew

00:27:27.590 --> 00:27:29.340 align:middle line:84%
George Van Tassel
back in the '70s.

00:27:29.340 --> 00:27:31.680 align:middle line:84%
>>STEINFELD: Do people know
what the Integratron is?

00:27:31.680 --> 00:27:33.110 align:middle line:90%
Who doesn't know?

00:27:33.110 --> 00:27:34.550 align:middle line:90%
A couple of people don't know.

00:27:34.550 --> 00:27:36.260 align:middle line:84%
Well, this guy,
George Van Tassel,

00:27:36.260 --> 00:27:39.680 align:middle line:84%
says he was visited
by these ET beings,

00:27:39.680 --> 00:27:42.590 align:middle line:84%
and they told him to
build this time machine.

00:27:42.590 --> 00:27:44.090 align:middle line:84%
Right here, the
Integratron, there's

00:27:44.090 --> 00:27:45.920 align:middle line:90%
no metal in that building.

00:27:45.920 --> 00:27:48.080 align:middle line:84%
It was supposed to
be a time machine.

00:27:48.080 --> 00:27:52.460 align:middle line:84%
And just before he completed
it, he died mysteriously.

00:27:52.460 --> 00:27:54.540 align:middle line:84%
And all his papers
were confiscated.

00:27:54.540 --> 00:27:56.060 align:middle line:84%
There's a movie
I produced called

00:27:56.060 --> 00:27:57.350 align:middle line:90%
"Calling All Earthlings."

00:27:57.350 --> 00:27:59.480 align:middle line:84%
Look it up, it's
about that story.

00:27:59.480 --> 00:28:02.060 align:middle line:84%
But he would constantly
get these messages

00:28:02.060 --> 00:28:03.602 align:middle line:84%
from these ETs about
this technology.

00:28:03.602 --> 00:28:05.435 align:middle line:84%
>>DESIREE HURTAK: But
it was a time machine,

00:28:05.435 --> 00:28:07.280 align:middle line:84%
it was also an
anti-gravity machine,

00:28:07.280 --> 00:28:09.560 align:middle line:84%
and it was a
rejuvenation machine.

00:28:09.560 --> 00:28:13.280 align:middle line:84%
And actually, it would create
like a spark of energy,

00:28:13.280 --> 00:28:15.470 align:middle line:84%
and then there
would be some metal

00:28:15.470 --> 00:28:16.750 align:middle line:90%
poles-- they're not on there.

00:28:16.750 --> 00:28:17.720 align:middle line:90%
>>STEINFELD: On the outside.

00:28:17.720 --> 00:28:20.240 align:middle line:84%
>>DESIREE HURTAK: That would
rotate and create like a field.

00:28:20.240 --> 00:28:23.870 align:middle line:84%
So you're creating a new
energy field inside, very much

00:28:23.870 --> 00:28:25.040 align:middle line:90%
like electromedicine.

00:28:25.040 --> 00:28:26.740 align:middle line:84%
So he had this
back in those days.

00:28:26.740 --> 00:28:28.115 align:middle line:84%
Let's listen a
little bit about--

00:28:28.115 --> 00:28:29.990 align:middle line:84%
>>STEINFELD: But I just want to
say, you can still go in there,

00:28:29.990 --> 00:28:31.490 align:middle line:84%
even though it was
almost completed,

00:28:31.490 --> 00:28:33.830 align:middle line:84%
it still feels like it
works on some level,

00:28:33.830 --> 00:28:35.700 align:middle line:84%
because there's a
vibration in there.

00:28:35.700 --> 00:28:37.950 align:middle line:84%
>>DESIREE HURTAK: They do a
lot of those toning there.

00:28:37.950 --> 00:28:40.460 align:middle line:84%
>>STEINFELD: This is George
Van Tassel she's going to play,

00:28:40.460 --> 00:28:42.950 align:middle line:90%
who created this whole thing.

00:28:42.950 --> 00:28:45.980 align:middle line:84%
And he actually had the first
UFO conferences out at Giant

00:28:45.980 --> 00:28:47.990 align:middle line:90%
Rock there in Joshua Tree.

00:28:47.990 --> 00:28:49.737 align:middle line:90%
So this is George.

00:28:49.737 --> 00:28:50.820 align:middle line:90%
We're going to see George.

00:28:50.820 --> 00:28:53.107 align:middle line:84%
And he used to work
for Howard Hughes,

00:28:53.107 --> 00:28:54.940 align:middle line:84%
and Howard Hughes also
funded a lot of this.

What time of day
or night was it.

00:28:57.730 --> 00:29:01.580 align:middle line:10%
- 2 o'clock in the morning
and approximately a full moon,

00:29:01.580 --> 00:29:03.920 align:middle line:10%
which is like daylight
on the desert.

00:29:03.920 --> 00:29:06.260 align:middle line:10%
And I didn't see the ship land.

One of my son-in-laws
that wasn't my son-in-law

00:29:09.460 --> 00:29:12.340 align:middle line:10%
of that time saw it come down.

00:29:12.340 --> 00:29:13.450 align:middle line:90%
- Outside or what?

00:29:13.450 --> 00:29:16.570 align:middle line:84%
- No, I was sound asleep
when he awakened me.

00:29:16.570 --> 00:29:17.990 align:middle line:90%
- This man awakened you.

00:29:17.990 --> 00:29:19.300 align:middle line:90%
- Well, something awakened.

00:29:19.300 --> 00:29:22.670 align:middle line:84%
The man got off the ship and
approached me before I even

00:29:22.670 --> 00:29:24.310 align:middle line:90%
knew there was a ship down.

00:29:24.310 --> 00:29:26.940 align:middle line:10%
I asked him what he wanted,
and said my name is Solgonda,

00:29:26.940 --> 00:29:29.440 align:middle line:10%
and I would be pleased
to show you our craft.

00:29:29.440 --> 00:29:30.240 align:middle line:90%
- Solgonda?

00:29:30.240 --> 00:29:31.390 align:middle line:90%
- Solgonda.

00:29:31.390 --> 00:29:34.000 align:middle line:84%
- Did you-- was the craft
visible to you at this time?

00:29:34.000 --> 00:29:35.450 align:middle line:90%
It was when he stated this.

00:29:35.450 --> 00:29:37.340 align:middle line:90%
I saw, beyond him, the ship.

00:29:37.340 --> 00:29:41.360 align:middle line:84%
After we got off the ship,
the man who invited me aboard,

00:29:41.360 --> 00:29:44.630 align:middle line:84%
who didn't look a day
over 28 years of age,

00:29:44.630 --> 00:29:48.080 align:middle line:84%
told me that he was over 700
years of age in our time.

00:29:48.080 --> 00:29:49.090 align:middle line:90%
- Oh, come off it.

00:29:49.090 --> 00:29:49.890 align:middle line:90%
George.

00:29:49.890 --> 00:29:50.895 align:middle line:90%
- That's right.

00:29:50.895 --> 00:29:53.270 align:middle line:84%
- Was this the guy that give
you the formula for the time

00:29:53.270 --> 00:29:54.070 align:middle line:90%
machine?

00:29:54.070 --> 00:29:55.030 align:middle line:90%
- That's the man.

00:29:55.030 --> 00:29:57.600 align:middle line:84%
- And what from did
the formula take?

00:29:57.600 --> 00:30:00.090 align:middle line:84%
Did he implant it into
your mind by telepathy

00:30:00.090 --> 00:30:02.540 align:middle line:84%
or did he give you something
written in English?

00:30:02.540 --> 00:30:04.375 align:middle line:90%
- He spoke it to me verbally.

Because George felt
music has the way

00:30:32.410 --> 00:30:35.290 align:middle line:84%
of opening the energy centers or
chakra points of the human body

00:30:35.290 --> 00:30:38.670 align:middle line:84%

>>DESIREE HURTAK: And
you can see these rods.

00:30:40.510 --> 00:30:42.680 align:middle line:84%
I think there was
something like 64 of them.

00:30:42.680 --> 00:30:44.050 align:middle line:90%
And they would spin around.

00:30:44.050 --> 00:30:47.200 align:middle line:84%
There was like a spark gap
that would energize the rods.

00:30:47.200 --> 00:30:50.470 align:middle line:84%
They would spin and create
that energy inside the dome.

on the life of Carlos Diaz.

00:31:39.322 --> 00:31:41.530 align:middle line:84%
>>DESIREE HURTAK: And it's
important to realize this,

00:31:41.530 --> 00:31:44.920 align:middle line:84%
that it was really an
energy field, a plasma

00:31:44.920 --> 00:31:46.390 align:middle line:90%
ship, as Dr. Hurtak said.

00:31:46.390 --> 00:31:50.290 align:middle line:10%
So these ships don't have
to be all nuts and bolts.

00:31:50.290 --> 00:31:52.340 align:middle line:84%
The old MUFON was
always interested in,

00:31:52.340 --> 00:31:53.700 align:middle line:90%
just tell me the nuts and bolts.

00:31:53.700 --> 00:31:56.080 align:middle line:84%
And even Michio Kaku
said, well, give me

00:31:56.080 --> 00:31:57.970 align:middle line:90%
the screwdriver from the ship.

00:31:57.970 --> 00:32:00.190 align:middle line:84%
But a lot of these ships
aren't having screwdrivers.

00:32:00.190 --> 00:32:02.800 align:middle line:84%
>>JJ HURTAK: So this would be
close to the Merkabah concept

00:32:02.800 --> 00:32:04.300 align:middle line:84%
of the ancient
prophets, Merkabah

00:32:04.300 --> 00:32:07.090 align:middle line:84%
by being the vehicle
of spiritual knowledge

and transformation.

00:32:08.310 --> 00:32:12.478 align:middle line:84%
Look here very carefully at
the shape and the design,

and let's go to the commentary.

00:32:13.770 --> 00:32:13.990 align:middle line:90%
>>DESIREE HURTAK: Yeah.

>>STEINFELD: It's an
energy machine sort of.

00:32:18.850 --> 00:32:21.890 align:middle line:84%
Or you not even
machines-- they're

00:32:21.890 --> 00:32:24.807 align:middle line:84%
non-physical energetic
vehicles, let's say.

00:32:24.807 --> 00:32:26.390 align:middle line:84%
>>DESIREE HURTAK:
So listen carefully,

00:32:26.390 --> 00:32:27.808 align:middle line:90%
because it's very interesting.

00:32:30.500 --> 00:32:33.260 align:middle line:84%
- What causes this
strange luminosity?

00:32:33.260 --> 00:32:35.250 align:middle line:90%
We still don't know.

00:32:35.250 --> 00:32:38.780 align:middle line:84%
For Professor James Hurtak,
the Carlos Diaz experience

00:32:38.780 --> 00:32:41.960 align:middle line:84%
brings together the scientific
and spiritual perspectives

00:32:41.960 --> 00:32:47.450 align:middle line:84%
of the future and delivers a key
to an interdimensional physics.

00:32:47.450 --> 00:32:51.890 align:middle line:84%
- Carlos Diaz's documents
are very important,

00:32:51.890 --> 00:32:54.870 align:middle line:84%
because they show a different
category of intelligence,

00:32:54.870 --> 00:32:58.820 align:middle line:84%
of what could be called the
bioplasmic form of intelligence

00:32:58.820 --> 00:33:02.090 align:middle line:84%
that is even beyond the
extraterrestrial, which

00:33:02.090 --> 00:33:05.210 align:middle line:84%
is using metallurgical
or physical spacecraft.

00:33:05.210 --> 00:33:08.740 align:middle line:90%


00:33:08.740 --> 00:33:12.590 align:middle line:84%
- Is the Carlos Diaz ship of
light an interdimensional gate,

00:33:12.590 --> 00:33:16.780 align:middle line:84%
a projection from a parallel
universe, an alien spacecraft?

00:33:16.780 --> 00:33:20.800 align:middle line:84%
Why does it appear so frequently
over the village of Tepoztlan?

00:33:20.800 --> 00:33:23.500 align:middle line:84%
Is there any connection
to the ancient cultures

00:33:23.500 --> 00:33:25.330 align:middle line:90%
of Central America?

00:33:25.330 --> 00:33:28.475 align:middle line:84%
Only the experience of a
simple young man from Mexico

00:33:28.475 --> 00:33:32.067 align:middle line:84%
might be the answer to
all these questions.

00:33:32.067 --> 00:33:34.400 align:middle line:84%
>>STEINFELD: See we're try
and figure out, is it solid--

00:33:34.400 --> 00:33:34.780 align:middle line:90%
>>JJ HURTAK: Wait.

00:33:34.780 --> 00:33:35.738 align:middle line:90%
>>STEINFELD: OK, sorry.

00:33:35.738 --> 00:33:39.580 align:middle line:84%
- The first time he invited me
to go consciously into a ship,

00:33:39.580 --> 00:33:43.060 align:middle line:84%
or I saw my friend
getting in first.

00:33:43.060 --> 00:33:47.170 align:middle line:84%
He we went through
this fog-like light.

00:33:47.170 --> 00:33:50.980 align:middle line:84%
When more than half of his
body was inside of the light,

00:33:50.980 --> 00:33:54.190 align:middle line:84%
his body got sucked
in into the object.

00:33:54.190 --> 00:33:58.510 align:middle line:84%
So what I did first is that
I put one hand into the light

00:33:58.510 --> 00:34:00.250 align:middle line:90%
to feel.

00:34:00.250 --> 00:34:03.040 align:middle line:84%
And to my surprise, it
went through the light,

00:34:03.040 --> 00:34:06.670 align:middle line:84%
and inside I felt
a nice temperature.

00:34:06.670 --> 00:34:10.239 align:middle line:84%
When I took my hand
out, I was very relieved

00:34:10.239 --> 00:34:13.340 align:middle line:84%
to see it was
still in one piece.

00:34:13.340 --> 00:34:16.600 align:middle line:84%
So that gave me the
confidence to walk in.

00:34:16.600 --> 00:34:20.350 align:middle line:84%
And when I had my body
halfway inside the object,

00:34:20.350 --> 00:34:23.040 align:middle line:90%
I was sucked into it too.

00:34:23.040 --> 00:34:27.190 align:middle line:84%
But once you're into it,
there is nothing you can see.

00:34:27.190 --> 00:34:29.920 align:middle line:84%
You just see yellow
light on all over.

00:34:29.920 --> 00:34:31.850 align:middle line:90%
You don't feel your toes.

00:34:31.850 --> 00:34:33.820 align:middle line:90%
You don't feel the floor.

00:34:33.820 --> 00:34:36.550 align:middle line:84%
But the sensation
is very peculiar,

00:34:36.550 --> 00:34:39.699 align:middle line:84%
because you feel very peaceful,
with a lot of love within you.

00:34:39.699 --> 00:34:43.429 align:middle line:90%


00:34:43.429 --> 00:34:46.810 align:middle line:84%
Once, when I came out
of the yellow light,

00:34:46.810 --> 00:34:53.840 align:middle line:84%
I realized I was not at the same
place, but I was in a big cave.

00:34:53.840 --> 00:34:57.640 align:middle line:84%
It had stalactites
and stalagmites

00:34:57.640 --> 00:35:02.520 align:middle line:84%
and between them I saw several
sculptures and ornaments

00:35:02.520 --> 00:35:06.580 align:middle line:84%
which were of the art
of the Maya culture.

00:35:06.580 --> 00:35:10.980 align:middle line:84%
this big cave was the place
where the ship hovered,

00:35:10.980 --> 00:35:14.640 align:middle line:84%
and there was a kind of
path we walked through.

00:35:14.640 --> 00:35:17.290 align:middle line:90%
And we came to another cave.

00:35:17.290 --> 00:35:21.510 align:middle line:84%
And I saw there are many
people who were very kind to me

00:35:21.510 --> 00:35:23.020 align:middle line:90%
and greeted me--

00:35:23.020 --> 00:35:25.250 align:middle line:90%
very nice people.

00:35:25.250 --> 00:35:29.070 align:middle line:84%
But the particular
thing about this cave

00:35:29.070 --> 00:35:32.020 align:middle line:84%
was that there were
seven egg-like spheres

00:35:32.020 --> 00:35:34.480 align:middle line:90%
of yellow light.

00:35:34.480 --> 00:35:37.700 align:middle line:84%
After we got to this
place, my friend

00:35:37.700 --> 00:35:41.200 align:middle line:84%
he stuck his hand
into one of the eggs

00:35:41.200 --> 00:35:45.930 align:middle line:84%
and took out a small bowl
of light, also yellow,

00:35:45.930 --> 00:35:50.500 align:middle line:84%
and said that this little
bowl could project a ray that

00:35:50.500 --> 00:35:55.460 align:middle line:84%
would touch my seventh vertebrae
in the middle of the spine,

00:35:55.460 --> 00:35:58.210 align:middle line:84%
and it would take
all the information

00:35:58.210 --> 00:36:00.910 align:middle line:90%
which is in my belonging.

00:36:00.910 --> 00:36:04.390 align:middle line:84%
Once I was there
in this place, he

00:36:04.390 --> 00:36:08.800 align:middle line:84%
invited me to go into one
of those spheres of light

00:36:08.800 --> 00:36:10.630 align:middle line:90%
or eggs of light.

00:36:10.630 --> 00:36:14.430 align:middle line:84%
windows When I
did so, I realized

00:36:14.430 --> 00:36:17.710 align:middle line:84%
that all the yellow
color changed.

00:36:17.710 --> 00:36:22.530 align:middle line:84%
And it was not yellow
anymore, but it was a scene

00:36:22.530 --> 00:36:25.840 align:middle line:90%
of a forest from the air.

00:36:25.840 --> 00:36:29.080 align:middle line:90%
It was like if I was flying.

00:36:29.080 --> 00:36:33.400 align:middle line:84%
And then I saw, on each
of my sides, a wing--

00:36:33.400 --> 00:36:35.180 align:middle line:90%
the wing of an eagle.

00:36:35.180 --> 00:36:38.410 align:middle line:84%
And I realized that
what I was looking at

00:36:38.410 --> 00:36:42.480 align:middle line:84%
was the information of
from an eagle, his memories

00:36:42.480 --> 00:36:46.180 align:middle line:84%
that they had stored
into this egg of light.

00:36:46.180 --> 00:36:47.020 align:middle line:90%
[END PLAYBACK]

00:36:47.020 --> 00:36:47.820 align:middle line:90%
>>STEINFELD: Yeah.

00:36:47.820 --> 00:36:49.730 align:middle line:84%
You see, there's so
much about the universe

00:36:49.730 --> 00:36:51.610 align:middle line:90%
we don't understand.

00:36:51.610 --> 00:36:53.980 align:middle line:84%
Like, we could say, oh,
maybe he was making this up,

00:36:53.980 --> 00:36:58.390 align:middle line:84%
or maybe there's technologies,
and portals, and dimensions,

00:36:58.390 --> 00:37:02.380 align:middle line:84%
that are beyond our capacity
to know at this point.

00:37:02.380 --> 00:37:06.430 align:middle line:84%
And these explorers,
or this guy, was taken,

00:37:06.430 --> 00:37:08.500 align:middle line:90%
but he had an experience.

00:37:08.500 --> 00:37:12.530 align:middle line:84%
And if we could sort of reverse
engineer those experiences,

00:37:12.530 --> 00:37:15.400 align:middle line:84%
we can start to develop
a new technology that's

00:37:15.400 --> 00:37:17.200 align:middle line:90%
based on portal science--

00:37:17.200 --> 00:37:19.150 align:middle line:90%
dimensional doorways of science.

00:37:19.150 --> 00:37:20.775 align:middle line:84%
>>DESIREE HURTAK:
But this relates also

00:37:20.775 --> 00:37:23.680 align:middle line:84%
to well Linda Moulton Howe says,
that, when they're giving us

00:37:23.680 --> 00:37:26.590 align:middle line:84%
information, sometimes they're
also taking information,

00:37:26.590 --> 00:37:28.120 align:middle line:84%
and they're
obviously storing it.

00:37:28.120 --> 00:37:31.820 align:middle line:84%
So he was talking about
how you can store neronic--

00:37:31.820 --> 00:37:33.280 align:middle line:90%
which is from the brain--

00:37:33.280 --> 00:37:36.670 align:middle line:84%
information of
different species.

00:37:36.670 --> 00:37:39.200 align:middle line:84%
And this is in a cave
that he had experienced.

00:37:39.200 --> 00:37:42.310 align:middle line:84%
When he said, he saw
nice people in the cave,

00:37:42.310 --> 00:37:44.200 align:middle line:90%
these were all alien beings.

00:37:44.200 --> 00:37:46.442 align:middle line:84%
They look like us, they
weren't that much different,

00:37:46.442 --> 00:37:47.650 align:middle line:90%
but they had that technology.

00:37:47.650 --> 00:37:49.840 align:middle line:84%
>>JJ HURTAK: He also
saw cosmic spheres.

00:37:49.840 --> 00:37:51.940 align:middle line:84%
And the Hinduistic
Sanskrit traditions

00:37:51.940 --> 00:37:56.230 align:middle line:84%
speak of how the physical
world was evolved out

00:37:56.230 --> 00:37:58.760 align:middle line:90%
of the glowing egg of Rama Agni.

00:37:58.760 --> 00:38:00.760 align:middle line:84%
>>DESIREE HURTAK: So he
was able to actually put

00:38:00.760 --> 00:38:03.010 align:middle line:84%
within himself, which is
what he was explaining

00:38:03.010 --> 00:38:05.500 align:middle line:84%
at the end, the thought
forms of the eagle,

00:38:05.500 --> 00:38:08.260 align:middle line:84%
and actually soaring
like the eagle saw.

00:38:08.260 --> 00:38:09.850 align:middle line:90%
He could actually experience it.

00:38:09.850 --> 00:38:11.440 align:middle line:84%
I mean, this is
something we're only

00:38:11.440 --> 00:38:13.870 align:middle line:90%
doing now with virtual reality.

00:38:13.870 --> 00:38:17.230 align:middle line:84%
But in actuality, this
is a way of really having

00:38:17.230 --> 00:38:19.420 align:middle line:90%
live events in a certain sense.

00:38:19.420 --> 00:38:21.472 align:middle line:84%
It's a little bit more
alive than virtual.

00:38:21.472 --> 00:38:23.680 align:middle line:84%
>>STEINFELD: But I also
think the ETs were showing us

00:38:23.680 --> 00:38:24.970 align:middle line:90%
the vastness of consciousness.

00:38:24.970 --> 00:38:25.770 align:middle line:90%
>>JJ HURTAK: Yes.

00:38:25.770 --> 00:38:31.060 align:middle line:84%
>>STEINFELD: And the
teleportation of states of mind

00:38:31.060 --> 00:38:32.930 align:middle line:90%
that they impose upon us.

00:38:32.930 --> 00:38:36.360 align:middle line:84%
So maybe they're creating
this world for us right now.

00:38:36.360 --> 00:38:39.990 align:middle line:84%
But we have the capabilities
of traveling in our mind

00:38:39.990 --> 00:38:41.850 align:middle line:90%
and knowing other realities.

00:38:41.850 --> 00:38:42.930 align:middle line:90%
This is the thing.

00:38:42.930 --> 00:38:45.340 align:middle line:84%
We think it's solid,
this world, but it's not.

00:38:45.340 --> 00:38:47.160 align:middle line:90%
This is just our conditioning.

00:38:47.160 --> 00:38:51.030 align:middle line:84%
>>JJ HURTAK: I've listed four
aspects of this experience--

00:38:51.030 --> 00:38:53.070 align:middle line:84%
one, the possibility
of interaction

00:38:53.070 --> 00:38:56.000 align:middle line:84%
with new concepts of
hyperdimensional consciousness.

00:38:56.000 --> 00:38:59.370 align:middle line:84%
In other words, coming from
outside our realm of living

00:38:59.370 --> 00:39:02.190 align:middle line:84%
intelligence--
exobiological lifeforms

00:39:02.190 --> 00:39:05.820 align:middle line:84%
interacting with humans through
consciousness expansion.

00:39:05.820 --> 00:39:07.980 align:middle line:84%
Secondly, extraterrestrials
may be playing out

00:39:07.980 --> 00:39:10.440 align:middle line:84%
their own evolutionary
roles, suggesting

00:39:10.440 --> 00:39:12.570 align:middle line:84%
that they're looking
at humanity as part

00:39:12.570 --> 00:39:16.170 align:middle line:84%
of a lab for medical
experimentation, et cetera.

00:39:16.170 --> 00:39:18.330 align:middle line:84%
Three, extra extraterrestrial
predictive science

00:39:18.330 --> 00:39:21.330 align:middle line:84%
may have been seeded
onto planet Mother Earth.

00:39:21.330 --> 00:39:24.400 align:middle line:84%
In other words, these
realities that we see now

00:39:24.400 --> 00:39:25.810 align:middle line:90%
have been planted long ago.

00:39:25.810 --> 00:39:27.970 align:middle line:84%
What we're seeing now
is a harvest time,

00:39:27.970 --> 00:39:29.670 align:middle line:84%
where higher intelligence
is coming back

00:39:29.670 --> 00:39:32.160 align:middle line:84%
to pick up the pieces
or to recompose

00:39:32.160 --> 00:39:33.890 align:middle line:90%
the fabric of consciousness.

00:39:33.890 --> 00:39:35.880 align:middle line:84%
And finally, earth
changes, as we define them,

00:39:35.880 --> 00:39:38.470 align:middle line:84%
may have been programmed
for this time period.

00:39:38.470 --> 00:39:41.370 align:middle line:84%
In other words, within the
logic and the superlogic

00:39:41.370 --> 00:39:45.000 align:middle line:84%
of consciousness, if we do not
attend to our responsibilities,

00:39:45.000 --> 00:39:48.270 align:middle line:84%
then another set of
entities or cosmic beings

00:39:48.270 --> 00:39:51.090 align:middle line:84%
come into play that deal
with the detailed workings

00:39:51.090 --> 00:39:52.330 align:middle line:90%
of the microuniverse.

00:39:52.330 --> 00:39:54.240 align:middle line:84%
>>STEINFELD: I
think climate change

00:39:54.240 --> 00:40:00.060 align:middle line:84%
and ETs are the two issues
that are forcing us to change.

00:40:00.060 --> 00:40:03.250 align:middle line:84%
They're forcing us to
evolve on this planet.

00:40:03.250 --> 00:40:06.270 align:middle line:84%
And if we don't, well,
there goes the neighborhood.

00:40:06.270 --> 00:40:08.520 align:middle line:84%
>>DESIREE HURTAK: And in
terms of "The Keys of Enoch,"

00:40:08.520 --> 00:40:10.710 align:middle line:84%
Dr. Hurtak was told,
in the 1970s, when

00:40:10.710 --> 00:40:14.910 align:middle line:84%
he had his initial experience,
that they are feeding us

00:40:14.910 --> 00:40:18.300 align:middle line:84%
a lot of information
in literally 64 areas

00:40:18.300 --> 00:40:22.050 align:middle line:84%
of science to be
able to graduate

00:40:22.050 --> 00:40:24.580 align:middle line:84%
into the next realm
of consciousness.

00:40:24.580 --> 00:40:28.200 align:middle line:84%
So if you think that the
whole thing of geology,

00:40:28.200 --> 00:40:30.660 align:middle line:84%
or astrophysics,
or even genetics

00:40:30.660 --> 00:40:34.230 align:middle line:84%
is just happenstance that we're
evolving, we don't think so.

00:40:34.230 --> 00:40:37.200 align:middle line:84%
We think that they're feeding
information to the scientists,

00:40:37.200 --> 00:40:40.642 align:middle line:84%
to the people, so that we can
be prepared for our next phase.

00:40:40.642 --> 00:40:43.100 align:middle line:84%
>>STEINFELD: And our next phase
is that we're a collective.

00:40:43.100 --> 00:40:45.840 align:middle line:90%
We're one body of humanity.

00:40:45.840 --> 00:40:49.260 align:middle line:84%
And we have to recognize that
if we're going to evolve.

00:40:49.260 --> 00:40:50.320 align:middle line:90%
That's our evolution.

00:40:50.320 --> 00:40:54.135 align:middle line:84%
It's collectively, not just
on this individual self.

00:40:54.135 --> 00:40:56.010 align:middle line:84%
>>JJ HURTAK: So what
does The New Yorker say?

00:40:56.010 --> 00:40:57.843 align:middle line:84%
>>STEINFELD: Oh, this
is my favorite cartoon

00:40:57.843 --> 00:40:58.650 align:middle line:90%
in the New Yorker.

00:40:58.650 --> 00:41:00.600 align:middle line:84%
Hi, honey, I'm going
to another dimension.

00:41:00.600 --> 00:41:01.530 align:middle line:90%
You need anything?

00:41:01.530 --> 00:41:02.790 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:41:02.790 --> 00:41:03.790 align:middle line:90%
That's in The New Yorker

00:41:03.790 --> 00:41:05.373 align:middle line:84%
>>JJ HURTAK: Part
of her body is going

00:41:05.373 --> 00:41:07.770 align:middle line:84%
through the wall like Carlos
Diaz into the plasma ship.

00:41:07.770 --> 00:41:08.560 align:middle line:90%
>>STEINFELD: That's the ship.

00:41:08.560 --> 00:41:10.020 align:middle line:84%
If that could be
in The New Yorker,

00:41:10.020 --> 00:41:13.020 align:middle line:84%
then maybe it can be
considered as a possibility.

00:41:13.020 --> 00:41:15.240 align:middle line:84%
Because, you know,
you make fun of things

00:41:15.240 --> 00:41:16.470 align:middle line:90%
that are possible, right?

00:41:16.470 --> 00:41:20.970 align:middle line:84%
So this is our portal to the
next level of consciousness

00:41:20.970 --> 00:41:22.640 align:middle line:90%
and of being.

00:41:22.640 --> 00:41:23.440 align:middle line:90%
So, Desiree.

00:41:23.440 --> 00:41:24.530 align:middle line:90%
>>JJ HURTAK: Yes.

00:41:24.530 --> 00:41:26.655 align:middle line:84%
>>DESIREE HURTAK: So we're
going to take a leap now

00:41:26.655 --> 00:41:28.978 align:middle line:84%
from the extraterrestrial
to look at the other side.

00:41:28.978 --> 00:41:30.270 align:middle line:90%
>>JJ HURTAK: Ultra-terrestrial.

00:41:30.270 --> 00:41:30.510 align:middle line:90%
>>DESIREE HURTAK: Yeah.

00:41:30.510 --> 00:41:32.965 align:middle line:84%
And other sides of reality
of how our mind actually

00:41:32.965 --> 00:41:34.590 align:middle line:84%
can function in other
types of reality.

00:41:34.590 --> 00:41:34.960 align:middle line:84%
>>JJ HURTAK: The
extraterrestrial

00:41:34.960 --> 00:41:38.010 align:middle line:84%
is confined to physical
technology, physical paradigms

00:41:38.010 --> 00:41:41.460 align:middle line:84%
of travel space-time, where the
ultraterrestrial have evolved

00:41:41.460 --> 00:41:43.030 align:middle line:90%
to the point of nonevolution.

00:41:43.030 --> 00:41:46.680 align:middle line:84%
They are free to circumnavigate
and to manifest and demanifest

00:41:46.680 --> 00:41:47.970 align:middle line:90%
in spheres of light.

00:41:47.970 --> 00:41:48.770 align:middle line:90%
>>STEINFELD: Right.

00:41:48.770 --> 00:41:52.380 align:middle line:84%
Ultraterrestrials are
dimensional beings

00:41:52.380 --> 00:41:54.300 align:middle line:84%
that come in and out
of our reality, that

00:41:54.300 --> 00:41:57.420 align:middle line:84%
communicate with us, that
we hope to evolve into.

00:41:57.420 --> 00:42:00.330 align:middle line:84%
It's not about being
ETs, it's about being

00:42:00.330 --> 00:42:01.710 align:middle line:90%
masters of the universe.

00:42:01.710 --> 00:42:04.880 align:middle line:84%
And of universes, if you
read "The Keys of Enoch,"

00:42:04.880 --> 00:42:05.680 align:middle line:90%
which is great.

00:42:05.680 --> 00:42:06.180 align:middle line:84%
>>DESIREE HURTAK:
And we actually

00:42:06.180 --> 00:42:08.070 align:middle line:90%
can call in those energies.

00:42:08.070 --> 00:42:09.750 align:middle line:84%
We can call in
extraterrestrials.

00:42:09.750 --> 00:42:11.250 align:middle line:90%
Many people do that.

00:42:11.250 --> 00:42:14.880 align:middle line:84%
I mean, there's many groups
that actually go out to night

00:42:14.880 --> 00:42:16.050 align:middle line:90%
and bring them in.

00:42:16.050 --> 00:42:19.410 align:middle line:84%
But you can also call in other
spheres and other energies,

00:42:19.410 --> 00:42:20.820 align:middle line:90%
like the orbs.

00:42:20.820 --> 00:42:23.670 align:middle line:84%
And here's a friend of ours who
is doing a special drumming.

00:42:23.670 --> 00:42:26.370 align:middle line:84%
And we believe that she called
in these other dimensional

00:42:26.370 --> 00:42:27.170 align:middle line:90%
reality.

00:42:27.170 --> 00:42:29.640 align:middle line:84%
>>JJ HURTAK: So sacred
arts, sacred science,

00:42:29.640 --> 00:42:32.610 align:middle line:84%
and sacred language are
part of the orientation

00:42:32.610 --> 00:42:36.540 align:middle line:84%
to work with the higher
levels of contact that

00:42:36.540 --> 00:42:39.590 align:middle line:84%
provide knowledge for all
members of the human race.

00:42:39.590 --> 00:42:41.340 align:middle line:84%
>>STEINFELD: And you
can feel them around.

00:42:41.340 --> 00:42:43.560 align:middle line:84%
Like, how many people
have felt a presence

00:42:43.560 --> 00:42:45.060 align:middle line:90%
around-- yeah, some people.

00:42:45.060 --> 00:42:48.930 align:middle line:84%
Look at that, at least half the
room has felt this presence.

00:42:48.930 --> 00:42:53.592 align:middle line:84%
It's a shift of awareness that
brings those presences to you.

00:42:53.592 --> 00:42:55.050 align:middle line:84%
They're actually
here all the time,

00:42:55.050 --> 00:42:58.527 align:middle line:84%
but we're just so focused on
our iPhone that we don't see.

00:42:58.527 --> 00:42:59.610 align:middle line:90%
>>DESIREE HURTAK: Exactly.

00:42:59.610 --> 00:43:00.810 align:middle line:90%
And really, they are here.

00:43:00.810 --> 00:43:02.268 align:middle line:84%
It's just a matter--
and that's why

00:43:02.268 --> 00:43:04.320 align:middle line:84%
it's important you come
to conferences like this.

00:43:04.320 --> 00:43:08.760 align:middle line:84%
Because if we can convince you
that these other levels exist,

00:43:08.760 --> 00:43:10.870 align:middle line:84%
then you can start
working with them.

00:43:10.870 --> 00:43:14.390 align:middle line:10%
The biggest blockage is
saying, no, I don't believe.

00:43:14.390 --> 00:43:16.380 align:middle line:10%
But most of you, of course, do.

00:43:16.380 --> 00:43:17.250 align:middle line:10%
So--

00:43:17.250 --> 00:43:20.310 align:middle line:10%
>>STEINFELD: Oh, John
Mack, he legitimized

00:43:20.310 --> 00:43:22.590 align:middle line:10%
the whole field of UFO contact.

00:43:22.590 --> 00:43:27.000 align:middle line:10%
He was a professor of psychiatry
at Harvard University.

00:43:27.000 --> 00:43:29.320 align:middle line:10%
And this guy Bud
Hopkins introduced him

00:43:29.320 --> 00:43:30.663 align:middle line:10%
to some abductees.

00:43:30.663 --> 00:43:32.330 align:middle line:10%
And they said, no,
these guys are crazy.

00:43:32.330 --> 00:43:34.610 align:middle line:10%
And then he started
to hear these stories,

00:43:34.610 --> 00:43:37.610 align:middle line:10%
and these people were not crazy.

00:43:37.610 --> 00:43:41.150 align:middle line:10%
They were very stable, normal
people with these very strange

00:43:41.150 --> 00:43:42.770 align:middle line:10%
experiences, like
Better and Barney

00:43:42.770 --> 00:43:46.400 align:middle line:10%
Hill, of meeting these ETs,
and being taken aboard,

00:43:46.400 --> 00:43:49.610 align:middle line:10%
and being planted or
genetics taken from them.

00:43:49.610 --> 00:43:53.000 align:middle line:84%
So he concluded that
maybe they're not crazy,

00:43:53.000 --> 00:43:55.610 align:middle line:84%
but maybe we're dealing
with a phenomena which

00:43:55.610 --> 00:43:58.580 align:middle line:84%
violates our sense of
reality and operates

00:43:58.580 --> 00:44:01.490 align:middle line:84%
in this gray area between
the physical world

00:44:01.490 --> 00:44:02.420 align:middle line:90%
and the subjective.

00:44:02.420 --> 00:44:04.430 align:middle line:84%
Like Carlos Diaz,
those plasma ships

00:44:04.430 --> 00:44:08.522 align:middle line:84%
that are not quite physical,
and they're not quite energy--

00:44:08.522 --> 00:44:09.730 align:middle line:90%
they're somewhere in between.

00:44:09.730 --> 00:44:12.560 align:middle line:84%
This phenomena will
not yield its secrets

00:44:12.560 --> 00:44:15.650 align:middle line:84%
until we discover
other ways of knowing.

00:44:15.650 --> 00:44:19.400 align:middle line:84%
We want to figure it out
rationally with our left brain.

00:44:19.400 --> 00:44:21.230 align:middle line:90%
This is this, and this--

00:44:21.230 --> 00:44:25.190 align:middle line:84%
well, we don't have the
rationale and the reasoning

00:44:25.190 --> 00:44:27.450 align:middle line:90%
capable of understanding it.

00:44:27.450 --> 00:44:30.075 align:middle line:84%
So we can't figure
it out, because we

00:44:30.075 --> 00:44:30.950 align:middle line:90%
don't have the tools.

00:44:30.950 --> 00:44:33.785 align:middle line:84%
We have to go more towards the
intuitive side, the feeling

00:44:33.785 --> 00:44:37.070 align:middle line:84%
side, and feel
into the experience

00:44:37.070 --> 00:44:39.680 align:middle line:84%
and know it's a
part of our reality.

00:44:39.680 --> 00:44:40.610 align:middle line:90%
That's the difference.

00:44:40.610 --> 00:44:42.300 align:middle line:90%
We have to-- who said?

00:44:42.300 --> 00:44:46.130 align:middle line:84%
I think Rumi said, I've given
up on my brain, you know?

00:44:46.130 --> 00:44:50.780 align:middle line:84%
We have to go into the
creative and the feeling

00:44:50.780 --> 00:44:52.123 align:middle line:90%
side, the right brain.

00:44:52.123 --> 00:44:53.540 align:middle line:10%
>>JJ HURTAK: We
invited John to be

00:44:53.540 --> 00:44:56.370 align:middle line:10%
with us in South Africa with
the Zulus, and he said to us,

00:44:56.370 --> 00:44:58.970 align:middle line:10%
we have to change the
ontology of science.

00:44:58.970 --> 00:45:02.170 align:middle line:10%
Science and scientific truth
is not what it's meant to be.

00:45:02.170 --> 00:45:04.670 align:middle line:10%
>>DESIREE HURTAK: And it's the
rational mind that even tells

00:45:04.670 --> 00:45:06.045 align:middle line:10%
you when you have
an experience--

00:45:06.045 --> 00:45:07.550 align:middle line:10%
I'm sure many of
you have had this--

00:45:07.550 --> 00:45:10.910 align:middle line:10%
when the rational mind
says, oh, that's impossible.

00:45:10.910 --> 00:45:12.440 align:middle line:10%
You're not really experiencing.

00:45:12.440 --> 00:45:14.030 align:middle line:10%
It you're not really seeing it.

00:45:14.030 --> 00:45:16.543 align:middle line:10%
Or you get afraid,
because there's

00:45:16.543 --> 00:45:17.960 align:middle line:10%
a light that comes
into your room,

00:45:17.960 --> 00:45:20.360 align:middle line:10%
and you kind of
block the experience.

00:45:20.360 --> 00:45:24.140 align:middle line:84%
The more your heart and
the more your consciousness

00:45:24.140 --> 00:45:26.270 align:middle line:84%
is aware of those
realities, the more

00:45:26.270 --> 00:45:27.860 align:middle line:90%
you will have those realities.

00:45:27.860 --> 00:45:29.943 align:middle line:84%
>>STEINFELD: I just wanted
to show them one thing.

00:45:29.943 --> 00:45:32.687 align:middle line:84%
So Harvard wanted to throw
him out get rid of him,

00:45:32.687 --> 00:45:33.770 align:middle line:90%
but he was there too long.

00:45:33.770 --> 00:45:38.690 align:middle line:84%
So Danny Sheehan, who's here,
was his lawyer for Harvard,

00:45:38.690 --> 00:45:41.930 align:middle line:84%
and they pleaded the case
that, no, just because someone

00:45:41.930 --> 00:45:44.270 align:middle line:84%
says something is
possible, who are you

00:45:44.270 --> 00:45:47.210 align:middle line:90%
to deny their experience?

00:45:47.210 --> 00:45:52.700 align:middle line:84%
So Harvard said, basically,
we don't care if it's true,

00:45:52.700 --> 00:45:54.770 align:middle line:90%
we don't believe it anyway.

00:45:54.770 --> 00:45:58.760 align:middle line:84%
So it's like people are so
stuck in this old mentality,

00:45:58.760 --> 00:46:01.820 align:middle line:84%
that no matter what
evidence you show them,

00:46:01.820 --> 00:46:03.680 align:middle line:90%
they're not going to evolve.

00:46:03.680 --> 00:46:05.150 align:middle line:90%
We need another generation.

00:46:05.150 --> 00:46:06.788 align:middle line:90%
We need new ways of knowing.

00:46:06.788 --> 00:46:08.830 align:middle line:84%
>>JJ HURTAK: And we need
to open a new dimension.

00:46:08.830 --> 00:46:11.590 align:middle line:84%
The fifth dimension is
here for our experience.

00:46:11.590 --> 00:46:13.340 align:middle line:84%
>>STEINFELD: I call
it the fifth dimension

00:46:13.340 --> 00:46:15.710 align:middle line:84%
because the third dimension
is the physical body.

00:46:15.710 --> 00:46:18.025 align:middle line:84%
The fourth dimension, to me,
is the emotional reality.

00:46:18.025 --> 00:46:19.400 align:middle line:10%
>>DESIREE HURTAK:
But it's really

00:46:19.400 --> 00:46:20.910 align:middle line:10%
time in terms of the scientific.

00:46:20.910 --> 00:46:22.370 align:middle line:10%
>>STEINFELD: But I
also feel it's emotion.

00:46:22.370 --> 00:46:23.300 align:middle line:10%
Does this person like me?

00:46:23.300 --> 00:46:24.100 align:middle line:10%
Am I going there?

00:46:24.100 --> 00:46:26.000 align:middle line:10%
Who's the-- and
that's our emotions.

00:46:26.000 --> 00:46:28.220 align:middle line:10%
Were caught up in
the human drama.

00:46:28.220 --> 00:46:30.950 align:middle line:10%
It's like, we think we're
so important-- our dramas,

00:46:30.950 --> 00:46:32.750 align:middle line:10%
our petty emotions.

00:46:32.750 --> 00:46:35.810 align:middle line:10%
But really, when you have
these experiences, near-death,

00:46:35.810 --> 00:46:38.750 align:middle line:10%
out-of-body, UFOs, past
life, energetic healing,

00:46:38.750 --> 00:46:41.540 align:middle line:10%

you do remote viewing,

00:46:41.540 --> 00:46:44.090 align:middle line:10%
creating your
reality consciously,

00:46:44.090 --> 00:46:46.640 align:middle line:10%
then this collective
awareness, these

00:46:46.640 --> 00:46:50.540 align:middle line:10%
are experiences that
take us out of the drama,

00:46:50.540 --> 00:46:52.400 align:middle line:10%
out of our personal drama.

00:46:52.400 --> 00:46:55.880 align:middle line:84%
And they're sometime the most
real experiences of your life.

00:46:55.880 --> 00:46:57.210 align:middle line:90%
That's where we're going.

00:46:57.210 --> 00:46:58.430 align:middle line:90%
That's the fifth dimension

00:46:58.430 --> 00:47:00.750 align:middle line:84%
I'm sure we've all
had one of these.

00:47:00.750 --> 00:47:04.160 align:middle line:84%
So we're all part of this
new level of consciousness.

00:47:04.160 --> 00:47:05.150 align:middle line:90%
That's so exciting.

00:47:05.150 --> 00:47:06.140 align:middle line:90%
We're all in this room together.

00:47:13.430 --> 00:47:15.650 align:middle line:84%
the brain is operating
in more than the third

00:47:15.650 --> 00:47:16.535 align:middle line:90%
and fourth dimension.

00:47:16.535 --> 00:47:18.410 align:middle line:84%
So they're already
starting to talk about it,

00:47:18.410 --> 00:47:20.570 align:middle line:84%
because they can
see the geometries

00:47:20.570 --> 00:47:22.430 align:middle line:84%
and how the brain
is functioning.

00:47:22.430 --> 00:47:24.410 align:middle line:84%
So, yes, we are
already functioning

00:47:24.410 --> 00:47:25.410 align:middle line:90%
in the fifth dimension.

Well, OK.

Maybe not so many.

And they were getting
clear details.

00:47:51.230 --> 00:47:54.590 align:middle line:84%
They were remote viewing
all the way to an NSA--

you don't--

it's not contained
in that brain.

00:52:38.320 --> 00:52:41.110 align:middle line:84%
It's being picked up
like a radio receiver.

mean the signal has stopped.

You pick up a new body and you
get that signal, the same soul

00:52:55.000 --> 00:52:58.465 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, we might change the
equipment once in a while--

00:52:58.465 --> 00:53:00.340 align:middle line:84%
but you have to keep
the equipment in shape--

00:53:00.340 --> 00:53:03.430 align:middle line:84%
but we're getting that
signal of the soul that

00:53:03.430 --> 00:53:08.290 align:middle line:84%
is capable of transforming and
transcending all universes,

00:53:08.290 --> 00:53:09.940 align:middle line:90%
because it's eternal.

00:53:09.940 --> 00:53:12.398 align:middle line:84%
>>DESIREE HURTAK: So looking
for consciousness in the brain

00:53:12.398 --> 00:53:14.970 align:middle line:84%
is like looking inside a
radio for the announcer.

00:53:14.970 --> 00:53:15.160 align:middle line:90%
>>STEINFELD: Right.

00:53:15.160 --> 00:53:16.390 align:middle line:84%
You open up the
radio, you're not

00:53:16.390 --> 00:53:18.348 align:middle line:84%
going to find anything
in there, because you're

00:53:18.348 --> 00:53:19.240 align:middle line:90%
receiving a signal.

00:53:19.240 --> 00:53:20.740 align:middle line:84%
>>DESIREE HURTAK:
So let's see, what

00:53:20.740 --> 00:53:23.980 align:middle line:84%
is the real reality of higher
levels of intelligence?

00:53:23.980 --> 00:53:27.310 align:middle line:84%
I mean, a UFO can come from
Alpha Centauri or Arcturus,

00:53:27.310 --> 00:53:30.570 align:middle line:84%
or even Orion, but what's
going on even beyond that,

00:53:30.570 --> 00:53:33.010 align:middle line:84%
if we talk about a
multi-dimensional cosmology?

00:53:33.010 --> 00:53:36.850 align:middle line:84%
Well, basically, there is a
greater consciousness reality.

00:53:36.850 --> 00:53:39.340 align:middle line:90%
We're part of a divine family.

00:53:39.340 --> 00:53:41.070 align:middle line:90%
We're all interconnected.

00:53:41.070 --> 00:53:42.760 align:middle line:90%
Quantum physics tells us that.

00:53:42.760 --> 00:53:45.760 align:middle line:84%
And so we are like
one little being

00:53:45.760 --> 00:53:48.700 align:middle line:84%
in the midst of
the vast reality--

00:53:48.700 --> 00:53:51.190 align:middle line:84%
>>JJ HURTAK: Cosmic
family, cosmic hierarchy--

00:53:51.190 --> 00:53:54.340 align:middle line:84%
cosmic relationships
that continue

00:53:54.340 --> 00:53:56.325 align:middle line:90%
beyond our human evolution.

00:53:56.325 --> 00:53:58.450 align:middle line:84%
>>STEINFELD: But it's also
states of consciousness.

00:53:58.450 --> 00:54:01.750 align:middle line:84%
Like, this being doesn't
have the awareness

00:54:01.750 --> 00:54:03.157 align:middle line:90%
of these other beings.

00:54:03.157 --> 00:54:04.990 align:middle line:84%
>>DESIREE HURTAK: But
we're still connected.

00:54:04.990 --> 00:54:07.962 align:middle line:84%
And actually, you do have that
if you open that awareness.

00:54:07.962 --> 00:54:09.670 align:middle line:84%
>>STEINFELD: If you
open, but most people

00:54:09.670 --> 00:54:11.252 align:middle line:84%
walk around looking
at their iPhone.

00:54:11.252 --> 00:54:13.210 align:middle line:84%
>>DESIREE HURTAK: So this
is really who we are.

00:54:13.210 --> 00:54:15.310 align:middle line:84%
We're a being that goes
not only this way--

00:54:15.310 --> 00:54:18.550 align:middle line:84%
we're all taught to do that
with our auras and vibrations--

00:54:18.550 --> 00:54:20.890 align:middle line:84%
but we're also a
being going this way,

00:54:20.890 --> 00:54:25.880 align:middle line:84%
and we can interconnect with
divine levels of consciousness.

00:54:25.880 --> 00:54:28.000 align:middle line:84%
So let's talk about
also the Merkabah

00:54:28.000 --> 00:54:30.970 align:middle line:84%
because this is kind of an
interesting scenario what

00:54:30.970 --> 00:54:32.570 align:middle line:90%
is that Merkabah vehicle.

00:54:32.570 --> 00:54:35.080 align:middle line:10%
Well, the Merkabah vehicle,
whether it's in a meditation

00:54:35.080 --> 00:54:39.220 align:middle line:10%
state or whether it's in
an actual elevation state,

00:54:39.220 --> 00:54:41.470 align:middle line:10%
can take you into
other dimensions,

00:54:41.470 --> 00:54:43.180 align:middle line:10%
into other levels of reality.

00:54:43.180 --> 00:54:45.490 align:middle line:10%
>>STEINFELD: Well, I think
that happened to Dr. Hurtak

00:54:45.490 --> 00:54:46.586 align:middle line:10%
here in 1973.

00:54:46.586 --> 00:54:52.120 align:middle line:10%
He activated his Merkabah being
and really left the earth plane

00:54:52.120 --> 00:54:52.930 align:middle line:10%
for--

00:54:52.930 --> 00:54:54.430 align:middle line:10%
you want to mention
something about?

00:54:54.430 --> 00:54:57.400 align:middle line:84%
>>JJ HURTAK: We had this
experience of tremendous light

00:54:57.400 --> 00:54:58.890 align:middle line:84%
placed around our
physical body--

00:54:58.890 --> 00:54:59.130 align:middle line:90%
>>DESIREE HURTAK: Yours.

00:54:59.130 --> 00:55:01.360 align:middle line:84%
>>JJ HURTAK: --my physical
body, in this case.

00:55:01.360 --> 00:55:04.568 align:middle line:84%
And then I was bilocated
into a higher realm,

00:55:04.568 --> 00:55:06.610 align:middle line:84%
and from the higher realm
I was taken spiritually

00:55:06.610 --> 00:55:08.370 align:middle line:90%
into a still higher realm.

00:55:08.370 --> 00:55:10.540 align:middle line:84%
It was shown that
the Merkabah make

00:55:10.540 --> 00:55:14.350 align:middle line:84%
use of sacred geometry,
a missing part of science

00:55:14.350 --> 00:55:17.350 align:middle line:84%
in the west, which has also
left out the language of color

00:55:17.350 --> 00:55:18.680 align:middle line:90%
and vibration.

00:55:18.680 --> 00:55:21.880 align:middle line:84%
Put these other
language experiences

00:55:21.880 --> 00:55:24.790 align:middle line:84%
and what we would call them
metalanguage experiences

00:55:24.790 --> 00:55:27.460 align:middle line:84%
together, then you would
create, as it were, a place

00:55:27.460 --> 00:55:30.710 align:middle line:84%
or wrong for your consciousness
to expand, actually to time

00:55:30.710 --> 00:55:31.510 align:middle line:90%
travel.

00:55:31.510 --> 00:55:33.927 align:middle line:84%
>>STEINFELD: But those other
levels that you were taken to

00:55:33.927 --> 00:55:36.460 align:middle line:84%
were different states
of awareness, right?

00:55:36.460 --> 00:55:37.473 align:middle line:90%
>>JJ HURTAK: Correct.

00:55:37.473 --> 00:55:39.640 align:middle line:84%
>>STEINFELD: How are they
different from this realm?

00:55:39.640 --> 00:55:43.340 align:middle line:84%
>>JJ HURTAK: In the sense that
there was no real limitation.

00:55:43.340 --> 00:55:48.760 align:middle line:84%
I was, shall we say, involving
a holistic experience

00:55:48.760 --> 00:55:51.820 align:middle line:84%
where every cell in my
body was electrified.

00:55:51.820 --> 00:55:53.740 align:middle line:84%
Cell by cell,
molecule by molecule,

00:55:53.740 --> 00:55:58.550 align:middle line:84%
my whole body apparatus
began to filter this light

00:55:58.550 --> 00:55:59.770 align:middle line:90%
and to emanate this light.

00:55:59.770 --> 00:56:02.300 align:middle line:84%
And this was captured on
film in several locations.

00:56:02.300 --> 00:56:07.300 align:middle line:84%
So this happened repeatedly,
where the Merkabah vehicle

00:56:07.300 --> 00:56:10.160 align:middle line:84%
was, as it were, the touchdown
of higher consciousness

00:56:10.160 --> 00:56:10.960 align:middle line:90%
contact.

00:56:10.960 --> 00:56:12.190 align:middle line:10%
>>DESIREE HURTAK: But I
want to point out something

00:56:12.190 --> 00:56:13.840 align:middle line:10%
that I just showed
to the audience

00:56:13.840 --> 00:56:19.060 align:middle line:10%
for a moment, this also similar
vehicle, if one could say,

00:56:19.060 --> 00:56:21.388 align:middle line:10%
was seen over the Pentagon.

00:56:21.388 --> 00:56:23.180 align:middle line:10%
I think some of you
are familiar with this.

00:56:23.180 --> 00:56:26.480 align:middle line:10%
>>JJ HURTAK: December 19, 2018.

00:56:26.480 --> 00:56:27.835 align:middle line:10%
Now watch it turn.

00:56:27.835 --> 00:56:28.635 align:middle line:10%
It rotates.

00:56:28.635 --> 00:56:30.177 align:middle line:10%
>>DESIREE HURTAK:
Nine years earlier,

00:56:30.177 --> 00:56:33.060 align:middle line:10%
it was also seen
over the Kremlin.

00:56:33.060 --> 00:56:34.030 align:middle line:10%
So it's interesting.

00:56:34.030 --> 00:56:36.480 align:middle line:10%
But the rotation is
what's really interesting.

00:56:36.480 --> 00:56:37.980 align:middle line:10%
It's really much more--

00:56:37.980 --> 00:56:40.710 align:middle line:10%
when I first saw this, I
did think it was a fake.

00:56:40.710 --> 00:56:44.430 align:middle line:84%
But the more that Jaime
Maussan has done the research

00:56:44.430 --> 00:56:48.660 align:middle line:84%
and investigation, there were
literally four to five people

00:56:48.660 --> 00:56:51.015 align:middle line:84%
in three different
locations that saw this

00:56:51.015 --> 00:56:52.590 align:middle line:90%
at 4:00 in the morning--

00:56:52.590 --> 00:56:53.620 align:middle line:90%
4:00 in the morning.

00:56:53.620 --> 00:56:55.287 align:middle line:10%
The first picture in
"The Keys of Enoch"

00:56:55.287 --> 00:56:57.420 align:middle line:10%
is the pyramidal capstone
floating over the earth.

00:56:57.420 --> 00:56:59.310 align:middle line:10%
This is the only book
in the world that

00:56:59.310 --> 00:57:03.300 align:middle line:10%
begins with the sign of the
pyramidal capstone in the sky

00:57:03.300 --> 00:57:05.228 align:middle line:10%
as a sign of the cosmic family.

00:57:05.228 --> 00:57:07.020 align:middle line:84%
>>STEINFELD: So what
does this mean to you?

00:57:07.020 --> 00:57:10.110 align:middle line:84%
>>JJ HURTAK: It means
that they apply a higher

00:57:10.110 --> 00:57:14.760 align:middle line:84%
sign of togetherness
to a world that's

00:57:14.760 --> 00:57:20.470 align:middle line:84%
being troubled by a geophysics
and a political dimension

00:57:20.470 --> 00:57:21.270 align:middle line:90%
of violence.

00:57:21.270 --> 00:57:24.120 align:middle line:10%
It means that we have
to smell the coffee

00:57:24.120 --> 00:57:26.850 align:middle line:10%
and go beyond the political
scenarios of Russia

00:57:26.850 --> 00:57:30.570 align:middle line:10%
and the United States,
whose high command--

00:57:30.570 --> 00:57:35.390 align:middle line:10%
chain of command-- was being
visited by a special geometry.

00:57:35.390 --> 00:57:37.140 align:middle line:84%
>>DESIREE HURTAK: So
we literally put away

00:57:37.140 --> 00:57:38.110 align:middle line:90%
our weapons of war.

00:57:38.110 --> 00:57:40.610 align:middle line:10%
>>JJ HURTAK: And this geometry
is part of a language system,

00:57:40.610 --> 00:57:43.560 align:middle line:10%
by the way-- it's part of
a higher cosmic grammar

00:57:43.560 --> 00:57:46.260 align:middle line:10%
that's been shown us from
space, that we are going

00:57:46.260 --> 00:57:49.650 align:middle line:10%
to be building, as it
were, a capstone cosmology

00:57:49.650 --> 00:57:52.290 align:middle line:10%
from the upper to
the human heart.

00:57:52.290 --> 00:57:53.910 align:middle line:84%
>>STEINFELD: This
was 2018, you said?

00:57:53.910 --> 00:57:54.270 align:middle line:90%
>>DESIREE HURTAK: Yes.

00:57:54.270 --> 00:57:55.070 align:middle line:90%
>>JJ HURTAK: 2018.

00:57:55.070 --> 00:57:56.850 align:middle line:90%
Before that it was in 2009.

00:57:56.850 --> 00:57:57.808 align:middle line:90%
>>DESIREE HURTAK: Yeah.

00:57:57.808 --> 00:58:00.840 align:middle line:84%
So it is a capstone reality,
which I think is important.

00:58:00.840 --> 00:58:03.567 align:middle line:84%
That's the missing capstone
to the Great Pyramid as it.

00:58:03.567 --> 00:58:05.400 align:middle line:84%
>>JJ HURTAK: The book
speaks of the capstone

00:58:05.400 --> 00:58:07.230 align:middle line:90%
and speaks to the year 2004.

00:58:07.230 --> 00:58:10.920 align:middle line:84%
What happened in 2004, the
Pentagon in Washington DC

00:58:10.920 --> 00:58:15.660 align:middle line:84%
admitted publicly on CNN
and also the Washington Post

00:58:15.660 --> 00:58:17.460 align:middle line:84%
that spaceships of
an unknown source

00:58:17.460 --> 00:58:19.725 align:middle line:84%
had been tracking our
military operations.

00:58:19.725 --> 00:58:21.350 align:middle line:84%
>>STEINFELD: That's
what the Navy said.

00:58:21.350 --> 00:58:22.933 align:middle line:84%
>>JJ HURTAK: So from
beginning to end,

00:58:22.933 --> 00:58:25.060 align:middle line:84%
there's been over
200 verifications--

00:58:25.060 --> 00:58:28.535 align:middle line:84%
200 confirmations of
very intricate cosmology.

00:58:28.535 --> 00:58:29.910 align:middle line:84%
>>DESIREE HURTAK:
So let's now go

00:58:29.910 --> 00:58:31.680 align:middle line:84%
through even another
stargate, which

00:58:31.680 --> 00:58:36.450 align:middle line:84%
is a really cosmic wheel of
life connected with the Buddhist

00:58:36.450 --> 00:58:37.500 align:middle line:90%
teachings.

00:58:37.500 --> 00:58:39.750 align:middle line:84%
In a certain sense,
these things are

00:58:39.750 --> 00:58:41.250 align:middle line:90%
more than three-dimensional.

00:58:41.250 --> 00:58:44.100 align:middle line:84%
They're actually
multidimensional realities

00:58:44.100 --> 00:58:47.800 align:middle line:84%
that can take you into higher
levels of consciousness.

00:58:47.800 --> 00:58:50.310 align:middle line:84%
And as we do that,
we are actually

00:58:50.310 --> 00:58:53.070 align:middle line:84%
starting to see
and feel ourselves

00:58:53.070 --> 00:58:55.230 align:middle line:90%
going into higher realities.

00:58:55.230 --> 00:58:58.392 align:middle line:84%
Don't put wings on your arms,
put wings above your head.

00:58:58.392 --> 00:59:00.350 align:middle line:84%
>>STEINFELD: So just look
at that for a second,

00:59:00.350 --> 00:59:03.360 align:middle line:84%
and just settle into
your body, and start

00:59:03.360 --> 00:59:08.670 align:middle line:84%
to feel that kind of
energy coming up out of us,

00:59:08.670 --> 00:59:14.640 align:middle line:84%
coming up outside, and kind of
ascending our physical body,

00:59:14.640 --> 00:59:17.885 align:middle line:84%
and kind of pulling
us out a little bit.

00:59:17.885 --> 00:59:19.260 align:middle line:84%
>>JJ HURTAK: What
is happening is

00:59:19.260 --> 00:59:21.570 align:middle line:84%
we are realizing we
have a higher body,

00:59:21.570 --> 00:59:23.610 align:middle line:84%
an over self body
that is expanding

00:59:23.610 --> 00:59:25.740 align:middle line:90%
through sacred geometry.

00:59:25.740 --> 00:59:29.400 align:middle line:84%
The wings or the
paraphysical dimensions

00:59:29.400 --> 00:59:32.415 align:middle line:84%
are going into a
biocoupling with the sound

00:59:32.415 --> 00:59:34.320 align:middle line:84%
and with the thought
forms that we are

00:59:34.320 --> 00:59:36.612 align:middle line:90%
generating as cosmic beings.

00:59:36.612 --> 00:59:38.570 align:middle line:84%
>>DESIREE HURTAK: So this
is who you truly are.

00:59:38.570 --> 00:59:43.020 align:middle line:10%
So see yourself in that pyramid
state and in meditation.

00:59:43.020 --> 00:59:45.900 align:middle line:10%
And also, feel the energy
coming through not only

00:59:45.900 --> 00:59:49.920 align:middle line:10%
your seventh chakra, but also
your heart chakra and all

00:59:49.920 --> 00:59:51.075 align:middle line:10%
the alignments.

00:59:51.075 --> 00:59:52.825 align:middle line:84%
>>STEINFELD: Feel your
feet on the ground,

00:59:52.825 --> 00:59:55.410 align:middle line:90%
but feel yourself being lifted.

00:59:55.410 --> 01:00:00.420 align:middle line:84%
So you span the dimensions-- you
span into those other realities

01:00:00.420 --> 01:00:03.360 align:middle line:84%
as you're being lifted
to higher consciousness.

01:00:03.360 --> 01:00:07.410 align:middle line:10%
>>JJ HURTAK: See your body in
terms of a biological pyramid,

01:00:07.410 --> 01:00:10.110 align:middle line:10%
with the circulatory
system from the upper part,

01:00:10.110 --> 01:00:15.030 align:middle line:10%
down through your lower
anatomy, and then up your spine

01:00:15.030 --> 01:00:17.730 align:middle line:10%
going into the higher
spiritual anatomy.

01:00:17.730 --> 01:00:20.490 align:middle line:10%
>>STEINFELD: This is the
activation of your Merkabah.

01:00:20.490 --> 01:00:23.880 align:middle line:84%
We all have Merkabahs that
have yet to be activated.

01:00:23.880 --> 01:00:29.680 align:middle line:84%
JJ somehow got that trigger
happening, and he was taken.

01:00:29.680 --> 01:00:33.702 align:middle line:84%
When that all clicks in,
boom, you're out of here.

01:00:33.702 --> 01:00:35.160 align:middle line:10%
>>DESIREE HURTAK:
So until you make

01:00:35.160 --> 01:00:38.040 align:middle line:10%
your unconscious conscious,
it will direct your life,

01:00:38.040 --> 01:00:39.760 align:middle line:10%
and you will call it fate.

01:00:39.760 --> 01:00:40.560 align:middle line:10%
>>STEINFELD: Right.

01:00:40.560 --> 01:00:43.530 align:middle line:10%
So our destiny is to
become conscious beings

01:00:43.530 --> 01:00:47.650 align:middle line:10%
with conscious control over
these higher ascending bodies.

01:00:47.650 --> 01:00:52.200 align:middle line:84%
So if you put your intention
on this conscious evolution,

01:00:52.200 --> 01:00:55.285 align:middle line:84%
this physical evolution,
that becomes your fate.

01:00:55.285 --> 01:00:56.160 align:middle line:90%
That's the intention.

01:00:56.160 --> 01:00:58.577 align:middle line:84%
>>JJ HURTAK: So these are some
of the attention cosmograms

01:00:58.577 --> 01:01:00.930 align:middle line:84%
or cosmic pictures that
came out of our experience.

01:01:00.930 --> 01:01:03.930 align:middle line:84%
I'm speaking of the
Cosmic Christ at the top.

01:01:03.930 --> 01:01:06.360 align:middle line:84%
The sacred language patterns
of the return of the dove,

01:01:06.360 --> 01:01:08.940 align:middle line:84%
the symbol of divine
communication,

01:01:08.940 --> 01:01:12.060 align:middle line:84%
and also the energy
grid of Mother Earth,

01:01:12.060 --> 01:01:15.710 align:middle line:84%
showing these energy
areas of sacred geometry

01:01:15.710 --> 01:01:19.350 align:middle line:84%
that deal with electromagnetic
variation or variance

01:01:19.350 --> 01:01:23.460 align:middle line:84%
open up to allow the cosmic
forces to come in momentarily

01:01:23.460 --> 01:01:24.660 align:middle line:90%
and show themselves.

01:01:24.660 --> 01:01:26.035 align:middle line:84%
>>DESIREE HURTAK:
So really, it's

01:01:26.035 --> 01:01:30.260 align:middle line:84%
higher contact with the
divine worlds of soul spirit

01:01:30.260 --> 01:01:33.448 align:middle line:84%
that we're really talking about
and with the lords of light.

01:01:33.448 --> 01:01:35.240 align:middle line:84%
>>STEINFELD: You see,
we already have that.

01:01:35.240 --> 01:01:37.550 align:middle line:90%
We're just unconscious to it.

01:01:37.550 --> 01:01:38.580 align:middle line:90%
That's the idea.

01:01:38.580 --> 01:01:43.430 align:middle line:84%
So if we can consciously go
there to these higher realms

01:01:43.430 --> 01:01:46.070 align:middle line:84%
to start to make
that divine contact,

01:01:46.070 --> 01:01:48.470 align:middle line:90%
that becomes our true destiny.

01:01:48.470 --> 01:01:50.132 align:middle line:84%
That's the language
of the universe.

01:01:50.132 --> 01:01:52.340 align:middle line:84%
>>JJ HURTAK: We're seeing
at the bottom of the screen

01:01:52.340 --> 01:01:53.145 align:middle line:90%
also the dolphins.

01:01:53.145 --> 01:01:54.140 align:middle line:90%
>>DESIREE HURTAK: Yeah, OK.

01:01:54.140 --> 01:01:55.973 align:middle line:84%
>>JJ HURTAK: And we
move on to an experience

01:01:55.973 --> 01:02:02.480 align:middle line:84%
that I had in 2000 in Mexico
near an archeological area

01:02:02.480 --> 01:02:03.360 align:middle line:90%
of ancient pyramids.

01:02:03.360 --> 01:02:04.120 align:middle line:90%
>>DESIREE HURTAK: Called Tulum.

01:02:04.120 --> 01:02:05.240 align:middle line:90%
>>JJ HURTAK: Tulum.

01:02:05.240 --> 01:02:07.370 align:middle line:84%
And I was chanting
the names of God

01:02:07.370 --> 01:02:13.160 align:middle line:84%
in ancient Aramaic,
Hebrew, Greek, and Coptic,

01:02:13.160 --> 01:02:17.300 align:middle line:84%
and suddenly a light
manifested around my body.

01:02:17.300 --> 01:02:20.960 align:middle line:84%
My translator was thrown
back by the intensity

01:02:20.960 --> 01:02:22.550 align:middle line:90%
of the light that manifested.

01:02:22.550 --> 01:02:24.950 align:middle line:84%
And a colleague who
was taking a picture

01:02:24.950 --> 01:02:26.330 align:middle line:84%
of his wife in
the foreground was

01:02:26.330 --> 01:02:28.710 align:middle line:84%
able to capture that
in a millisecond.

01:02:28.710 --> 01:02:31.940 align:middle line:84%
This light experience
of superluminal light

01:02:31.940 --> 01:02:35.000 align:middle line:84%
is possible for each one
of us, but the preparation

01:02:35.000 --> 01:02:39.950 align:middle line:84%
has to be sacred, shall we
say, giving the once off

01:02:39.950 --> 01:02:43.590 align:middle line:84%
to help humanity
through education,

01:02:43.590 --> 01:02:46.700 align:middle line:84%
through sacred science, as
well as through sacred art.

01:02:46.700 --> 01:02:48.643 align:middle line:84%
And in that sense, we
become the renaissance

01:02:48.643 --> 01:02:50.060 align:middle line:84%
of the new culture
that will come,

01:02:50.060 --> 01:02:52.730 align:middle line:84%
I believe, out of
cosmic contact.

01:02:52.730 --> 01:02:53.960 align:middle line:90%
>>STEINFELD: Go back to one--

01:02:53.960 --> 01:02:55.905 align:middle line:90%
did you feel the light essence?

01:02:55.905 --> 01:02:57.905 align:middle line:84%
>>JJ HURTAK: I felt energy
rush through my body,

01:02:57.905 --> 01:02:58.980 align:middle line:90%
>>STEINFELD: Uh-huh.

01:02:58.980 --> 01:03:01.040 align:middle line:84%
>>JJ HURTAK: I felt,
as it were, up and down

01:03:01.040 --> 01:03:03.200 align:middle line:84%
the spine, something
greater than the Kundalini

01:03:03.200 --> 01:03:06.680 align:middle line:84%
experience, where light
was able to, shall we say,

01:03:06.680 --> 01:03:09.470 align:middle line:84%
be on the top of my head for
a few seconds afterwards,

01:03:09.470 --> 01:03:11.610 align:middle line:84%
and people felt
their bodies tingle.

01:03:11.610 --> 01:03:13.610 align:middle line:84%
It was interesting, though,
that this took place

01:03:13.610 --> 01:03:14.870 align:middle line:90%
where the pyramids were.

01:03:14.870 --> 01:03:18.830 align:middle line:84%
And again, I was shown in
1973 that the pyramidal grids

01:03:18.830 --> 01:03:21.560 align:middle line:84%
throughout the world were the
original contract places that

01:03:21.560 --> 01:03:23.780 align:middle line:84%
were left behind
for us to experience

01:03:23.780 --> 01:03:25.190 align:middle line:90%
in our evolutionary process.

01:03:25.190 --> 01:03:25.990 align:middle line:90%
>>STEINFELD: Right.

01:03:25.990 --> 01:03:28.130 align:middle line:90%
So we all are capable of this.

01:03:28.130 --> 01:03:31.430 align:middle line:84%
This is what I'm saying
in this next illustration.

01:03:31.430 --> 01:03:34.280 align:middle line:84%
We come in with this
vast imagination,

01:03:34.280 --> 01:03:36.710 align:middle line:90%
this vast creative potential.

01:03:36.710 --> 01:03:39.410 align:middle line:84%
And by the time
we're five years old,

01:03:39.410 --> 01:03:43.190 align:middle line:84%
we're taught A-B-C,
1, 2, 3, and our mind

01:03:43.190 --> 01:03:47.840 align:middle line:84%
is put into these very little
boxes that stuff everything--

01:03:47.840 --> 01:03:52.100 align:middle line:84%
our creative potentials, our
love, our transformation.

01:03:52.100 --> 01:03:54.030 align:middle line:90%
Because this is who we are.

01:03:54.030 --> 01:03:57.170 align:middle line:90%
We are not these little boxes.

01:03:57.170 --> 01:04:00.320 align:middle line:84%
So we're here to graduate
to these higher realms.

01:04:00.320 --> 01:04:04.000 align:middle line:84%
It's sad that people
think they're in this box,

01:04:04.000 --> 01:04:04.800 align:middle line:90%
and you're not.

01:04:04.800 --> 01:04:05.840 align:middle line:84%
>>JJ HURTAK: So
this is the marriage

01:04:05.840 --> 01:04:07.430 align:middle line:84%
between the human
self and the higher

01:04:07.430 --> 01:04:08.900 align:middle line:90%
or overself coming together.

01:04:08.900 --> 01:04:10.317 align:middle line:84%
>>DESIREE HURTAK:
And actually, we

01:04:10.317 --> 01:04:12.920 align:middle line:84%
feel that we actually
come from a light essence,

01:04:12.920 --> 01:04:15.590 align:middle line:84%
and then we manifest down
in the physical form.

01:04:15.590 --> 01:04:18.050 align:middle line:84%
I know many of you feel you
are just simply visiting

01:04:18.050 --> 01:04:21.290 align:middle line:84%
this planet by living in
this body, and that's real.

01:04:21.290 --> 01:04:24.470 align:middle line:84%
Because once you leave the
physical body-- and the body

01:04:24.470 --> 01:04:25.640 align:middle line:90%
is important, right now.

01:04:25.640 --> 01:04:26.480 align:middle line:90%
Don't get me wrong.

01:04:26.480 --> 01:04:29.510 align:middle line:84%
We all need to keep it, and keep
it well, and keep it healthy,

01:04:29.510 --> 01:04:32.100 align:middle line:84%
because it allows us to
do what we need to do.

01:04:32.100 --> 01:04:34.220 align:middle line:84%
But ultimately,
our essence is what

01:04:34.220 --> 01:04:37.400 align:middle line:84%
we would call the higher
overself or our higher light

01:04:37.400 --> 01:04:38.990 align:middle line:90%
presence.

01:04:38.990 --> 01:04:41.020 align:middle line:90%
>>STEINFELD: And here we are.

01:04:41.020 --> 01:04:43.222 align:middle line:84%
So we're the lower self
and the higher self.

01:04:43.222 --> 01:04:44.930 align:middle line:84%
Actually, the Hurtaks
wrote a book called

01:04:44.930 --> 01:04:46.850 align:middle line:90%
"The Overself Awakening."

01:04:46.850 --> 01:04:48.650 align:middle line:84%
And this is an
illustration of how we

01:04:48.650 --> 01:04:50.720 align:middle line:90%
can be in multiple dimensions.

01:04:50.720 --> 01:04:53.060 align:middle line:84%
Even though we think we're
just sitting in that chair,

01:04:53.060 --> 01:04:56.510 align:middle line:84%
if you use your mind
and your imagination,

01:04:56.510 --> 01:04:58.900 align:middle line:84%
we can transcend
this in a moment.

01:04:58.900 --> 01:05:01.400 align:middle line:84%
>>JJ HURTAK: So the bottom line
is, we are multidimensional,

01:05:01.400 --> 01:05:02.570 align:middle line:90%
nonlocal beings.

01:05:02.570 --> 01:05:02.990 align:middle line:90%
>>STEINFELD: Right.

01:05:02.990 --> 01:05:05.240 align:middle line:84%
>>JJ HURTAK: Waking up in a
vast and awesome universe,

01:05:05.240 --> 01:05:07.400 align:middle line:84%
recognizing our
planet is just one

01:05:07.400 --> 01:05:10.917 align:middle line:84%
of many centers of consciousness
and spiritual growth.

01:05:10.917 --> 01:05:13.250 align:middle line:84%
>>DESIREE HURTAK: And so let
us go through the doorway--

01:05:13.250 --> 01:05:14.240 align:middle line:90%
the cosmic doorway.

01:05:14.240 --> 01:05:16.670 align:middle line:84%
We're going to do a meditation
in about three minutes.

01:05:16.670 --> 01:05:19.220 align:middle line:84%
>>STEINFELD: That doorway
is right inside you.

01:05:19.220 --> 01:05:23.060 align:middle line:84%
Right inside that brain of
yours is an infinite doorway

01:05:23.060 --> 01:05:24.320 align:middle line:90%
into the unknown.

01:05:24.320 --> 01:05:25.653 align:middle line:90%
Really, it's there for everyone.

01:05:25.653 --> 01:05:27.570 align:middle line:84%
>>DESIREE HURTAK: And
when we do a meditation,

01:05:27.570 --> 01:05:29.627 align:middle line:84%
we actually like to do
some chanting with it.

01:05:29.627 --> 01:05:30.710 align:middle line:10%
So we'll kind of lead you.

01:05:30.710 --> 01:05:32.780 align:middle line:10%
If you'd like to
join us, please do,

01:05:32.780 --> 01:05:35.840 align:middle line:10%
because it helps to
evolve our consciousness

01:05:35.840 --> 01:05:39.290 align:middle line:10%
and our understanding and just,
like, get us out of the box,

01:05:39.290 --> 01:05:40.730 align:middle line:10%
as Alan was showing us.

01:05:40.730 --> 01:05:44.090 align:middle line:10%
In fact, Alan's very big on
moving through the doorway

01:05:44.090 --> 01:05:45.710 align:middle line:10%
and getting into a new reality.

01:05:45.710 --> 01:05:48.260 align:middle line:84%
>>STEINFELD: Oh, this is a
little thing where you actually

01:05:48.260 --> 01:05:50.965 align:middle line:84%
are capable-- this is
woodcut from the 1700s.

01:05:50.965 --> 01:05:54.200 align:middle line:84%
This guy sticks his head
through one level of reality,

01:05:54.200 --> 01:05:57.560 align:middle line:84%
into another level of reality,
which is all around us.

01:05:57.560 --> 01:06:00.340 align:middle line:84%
Really, people have these
awakening experiences.

01:06:00.340 --> 01:06:05.060 align:middle line:84%
JJ's made a whole career out of
this experiences he had in 1973

01:06:05.060 --> 01:06:08.700 align:middle line:84%
that changed his life and the
life of so many other people.

01:06:08.700 --> 01:06:11.660 align:middle line:84%
So we're all capable of
transforming our reality

01:06:11.660 --> 01:06:14.330 align:middle line:90%
and becoming great beings--

01:06:14.330 --> 01:06:15.440 align:middle line:90%
great evolved beings.

01:06:15.440 --> 01:06:17.030 align:middle line:84%
>>DESIREE HURTAK: And I
like to see it by this.

01:06:17.030 --> 01:06:18.800 align:middle line:84%
I took Blake's picture
and actually made

01:06:18.800 --> 01:06:22.050 align:middle line:84%
it multiple realities,
because that's who we are.

01:06:22.050 --> 01:06:23.870 align:middle line:84%
We're actually not
even limited to here.

01:06:23.870 --> 01:06:26.400 align:middle line:84%
We're only limited to here
when our mind tells us

01:06:26.400 --> 01:06:27.200 align:middle line:90%
we're limited.

01:06:27.200 --> 01:06:29.900 align:middle line:84%
When we open that threshold,

01:06:40.520 --> 01:06:43.820 align:middle line:84%

be sitting next to them.

I know many of the

be even touching.

You can send energy from afar.

That energy is also received.

01:07:12.750 --> 01:07:14.210 align:middle line:84%
So there's not
only remote viewing

01:07:14.210 --> 01:07:18.032 align:middle line:84%

So there's an upward spiral
and a downward spiral,

01:07:22.505 --> 01:07:25.580 align:middle line:84%
and we have the decision or
choice to go, if we wish,

01:07:25.580 --> 01:07:26.810 align:middle line:90%
with the upward spiral.

citizens in your universe,

Hold that essence of light.

01:26:21.290 --> 01:26:24.580 align:middle line:84%
We can maintain
the physical form

01:26:24.580 --> 01:26:30.610 align:middle line:84%
for another 50 to 75
years, but we are always
