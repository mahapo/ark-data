I want to present Conscious

>> Hey.

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:26.110 align:middle line:90%
Thank you, Jim.

00:00:26.110 --> 00:00:28.230 align:middle line:90%
Love you too, brother.

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:30.360 align:middle line:90%
Hello, everyone.

00:00:30.360 --> 00:00:32.470 align:middle line:90%
How's everybody today?

00:00:32.470 --> 00:00:36.860 align:middle line:84%
I see a lot of familiar
faces and some new faces.

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:39.890 align:middle line:84%
Well, today, we're going to
go over some illustrations.

00:00:39.890 --> 00:00:42.650 align:middle line:10%
I've been working with Gaia
over the last couple of years

00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:44.720 align:middle line:10%
and with their sketch
artist, and I'm like,

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:46.970 align:middle line:10%
there's no way they're going
to be able to like really

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:49.490 align:middle line:10%
depict what I saw.

00:00:49.490 --> 00:00:51.910 align:middle line:84%
But like those criminal
guys with the police,

00:00:51.910 --> 00:00:54.110 align:middle line:90%
and they do the sketches.

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:56.780 align:middle line:84%
I was like just sitting
there talking at this desk

00:00:56.780 --> 00:01:00.530 align:middle line:84%
for like an hour, and he flips
up the paper, and I'm like,

00:01:00.530 --> 00:01:01.520 align:middle line:90%
what?

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:04.209 align:middle line:90%
Like how do they do that?

00:01:04.209 --> 00:01:05.840 align:middle line:84%
I'm thinking, man,
are they in my head?

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:09.160 align:middle line:90%


00:01:09.160 --> 00:01:11.880 align:middle line:84%
I had a couple of requests
though, because I usually--

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:15.980 align:middle line:84%
I'm a regenerative medicine
specialist, and a lot of people

00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:18.770 align:middle line:84%
have been asking for
me to show this video.

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:22.130 align:middle line:84%
Before I start
getting into that,

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:24.500 align:middle line:84%
I was in US Air
Force for five years

00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:27.765 align:middle line:84%
and active two years
in active reserve.

00:01:27.765 --> 00:01:29.390 align:middle line:84%
And was stationed at
Kirtland Air Force

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:34.160 align:middle line:84%
Base and some other bases, home
of Sandia Labs and Los Alamos

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:37.730 align:middle line:84%
labs, as part of some
compartmentalized projects,

00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:39.680 align:middle line:90%
while I was active duty.

00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:42.740 align:middle line:84%
But I was coming
under the impression

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:46.370 align:middle line:84%
that the business I was doing
in these underground facilities

00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:49.970 align:middle line:84%
were actually controlled by
major, major corporations.

00:01:49.970 --> 00:01:53.360 align:middle line:84%
The government was
basically using the military

00:01:53.360 --> 00:01:57.790 align:middle line:84%
to protect these high end
underground facilities.

00:01:57.790 --> 00:02:00.530 align:middle line:84%
So these people
were paying rent for

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:03.110 align:middle line:84%
these underground facilities,
meaning the corporations,

00:02:03.110 --> 00:02:05.750 align:middle line:84%
and of course, what better
place to have a secret facility

00:02:05.750 --> 00:02:08.990 align:middle line:84%
that a corporation
owns, or rents or leases

00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:13.670 align:middle line:84%
from the government, than
on a military installation?

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:18.075 align:middle line:84%
From there, and my AFSC was
a surgical technologist.

00:02:18.075 --> 00:02:19.700 align:middle line:84%
I'm a surgical first
assist, and I used

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:23.810 align:middle line:90%
to teach that in the Air Force.

00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:26.120 align:middle line:84%
And so I got this
moonlighting position.

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:29.060 align:middle line:84%
They said, you want to do some
extra work, Smith, at night?

00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:31.460 align:middle line:84%
Or not always at night, but
it's called moonlighting,

00:02:31.460 --> 00:02:36.770 align:middle line:84%
any type of extra job that you
do that's not really affiliated

00:02:36.770 --> 00:02:37.792 align:middle line:90%
100% with the military.

00:02:37.792 --> 00:02:38.750 align:middle line:90%
And I said, yeah, sure.

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:41.480 align:middle line:84%
I just wanted some extra
money, because Honda just

00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:44.620 align:middle line:90%
came out with the new CBR600RR.

00:02:44.620 --> 00:02:45.530 align:middle line:90%
I'm 19.

00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:46.550 align:middle line:90%
I'm ready to go.

00:02:46.550 --> 00:02:48.530 align:middle line:90%
I need some extra cash.

00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:50.450 align:middle line:84%
So I took it, and
over the course

00:02:50.450 --> 00:02:55.970 align:middle line:84%
of time, what has
unfolded was I thought

00:02:55.970 --> 00:02:59.720 align:middle line:84%
I was going to be doing organ
harvesting for fallen soldiers,

00:02:59.720 --> 00:03:02.570 align:middle line:84%
because that was one
of my specialties.

00:03:02.570 --> 00:03:06.470 align:middle line:84%
And after going
through the debriefing,

00:03:06.470 --> 00:03:10.190 align:middle line:84%
I realized that something
else was going on.

00:03:10.190 --> 00:03:13.760 align:middle line:84%
But I wasn't really allowed to
ask too much at the beginning,

00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:16.310 align:middle line:84%
and basically, there's
a misconception,

00:03:16.310 --> 00:03:19.680 align:middle line:84%
I did 3,000 alien autopsies
and that was not--

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:20.480 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:03:20.480 --> 00:03:21.522 align:middle line:90%
It wasn't like full body.

00:03:21.522 --> 00:03:23.930 align:middle line:84%
These are tissue samples,
and I was harvesting

00:03:23.930 --> 00:03:25.220 align:middle line:90%
just pieces of tissue.

00:03:25.220 --> 00:03:27.380 align:middle line:84%
And there were eventually
some full bodies

00:03:27.380 --> 00:03:30.830 align:middle line:84%
and limbs and things that
were coming back, after that.

00:03:30.830 --> 00:03:32.660 align:middle line:84%
So we're going to go
over some of that,

00:03:32.660 --> 00:03:37.250 align:middle line:84%
but I'm also known for inventing
one of the first tabletop

00:03:37.250 --> 00:03:39.560 align:middle line:84%
stem cell concentrators
and platelet-rich plasma

00:03:39.560 --> 00:03:41.220 align:middle line:90%
concentrators.

00:03:41.220 --> 00:03:44.570 align:middle line:84%
[FAINT COMPUTERIZED VOICE]
Confirmation complete.

00:03:44.570 --> 00:03:45.980 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:03:45.980 --> 00:03:48.310 align:middle line:90%
So this happens now and then.

00:03:48.310 --> 00:03:51.440 align:middle line:90%


00:03:51.440 --> 00:03:54.980 align:middle line:84%
Contact work, we'll talk
about contact work as well.

00:03:54.980 --> 00:03:57.840 align:middle line:90%


00:03:57.840 --> 00:04:00.470 align:middle line:84%
But I'm going to go
into a story, when

00:04:00.470 --> 00:04:03.050 align:middle line:84%
I got out of the projects
and developed this system.

00:04:03.050 --> 00:04:07.100 align:middle line:84%
And I had a friend of mine who
was a manager at the Octagon

00:04:07.100 --> 00:04:11.120 align:middle line:84%
Wildlife Sanctuary, in Florida,
in DeSoto County, Florida,

00:04:11.120 --> 00:04:13.670 align:middle line:84%
near Fort Myers,
and I volunteered

00:04:13.670 --> 00:04:17.209 align:middle line:84%
there to do a lot of the wound
care and work on the animals.

00:04:17.209 --> 00:04:19.670 align:middle line:84%
Ever since I was a young
boy, and when I got out

00:04:19.670 --> 00:04:21.980 align:middle line:84%
of the military, instead
of scooping poop,

00:04:21.980 --> 00:04:24.832 align:middle line:84%
I was then actually
treating the animals.

00:04:24.832 --> 00:04:26.540 align:middle line:84%
And there was all
sorts of animals there,

00:04:26.540 --> 00:04:29.465 align:middle line:84%
lions and monkeys and
elephants and emus

00:04:29.465 --> 00:04:31.340 align:middle line:84%
and all sorts of really
interesting creatures

00:04:31.340 --> 00:04:33.255 align:middle line:84%
that were going
to be euthanized.

00:04:33.255 --> 00:04:34.880 align:middle line:84%
Because the zoos were
closing, and they

00:04:34.880 --> 00:04:37.160 align:middle line:90%
would take these animals in.

00:04:37.160 --> 00:04:40.728 align:middle line:84%
And I would go out there
and use my system on them

00:04:40.728 --> 00:04:42.770 align:middle line:84%
to heal their wounds or
their tendons, ligaments,

00:04:42.770 --> 00:04:44.900 align:middle line:90%
or spinal cord injuries.

00:04:44.900 --> 00:04:47.030 align:middle line:84%
And one day, the
zoo manager came up

00:04:47.030 --> 00:04:49.160 align:middle line:84%
to me, and his name's
David Weathers.

00:04:49.160 --> 00:04:52.910 align:middle line:84%
He's now called The
Cobra Kid for a reason.

00:04:52.910 --> 00:04:55.790 align:middle line:84%
He works with the Jackass
boys, the crazy movie,

00:04:55.790 --> 00:04:57.022 align:middle line:90%
the crazy show.

00:04:57.022 --> 00:04:57.980 align:middle line:90%
He's friends with them.

00:04:57.980 --> 00:05:00.390 align:middle line:84%
He's been on that movie
a couple of times,

00:05:00.390 --> 00:05:02.840 align:middle line:84%
and he's a real Crocodile
Dundee hardcore kid.

00:05:02.840 --> 00:05:06.130 align:middle line:84%
And he came up to me
one day, and I remember,

00:05:06.130 --> 00:05:07.150 align:middle line:90%
wearing a wife beater.

00:05:07.150 --> 00:05:10.520 align:middle line:84%
And he was probably cleaning
out the stalls there,

00:05:10.520 --> 00:05:11.320 align:middle line:90%
and he's all dirty.

00:05:11.320 --> 00:05:13.230 align:middle line:84%
And I was working on
one of the animals,

00:05:13.230 --> 00:05:16.320 align:middle line:84%
and he's like, hey,
Em, you know that stuff

00:05:16.320 --> 00:05:18.820 align:middle line:84%
you put on the tigers and the
lions that heals their wounds?

00:05:18.820 --> 00:05:22.530 align:middle line:84%
He's like, you think you
could do that like on a human?

00:05:22.530 --> 00:05:25.450 align:middle line:84%
And I was like, actually, I
developed this for humans.

00:05:25.450 --> 00:05:27.490 align:middle line:84%
I'm just out here
volunteering for you guys,

00:05:27.490 --> 00:05:28.803 align:middle line:90%
but yeah, we could do it.

00:05:28.803 --> 00:05:29.720 align:middle line:90%
What's wrong with you?

00:05:29.720 --> 00:05:32.830 align:middle line:84%
He's like a few days
ago, I was messing

00:05:32.830 --> 00:05:36.600 align:middle line:84%
with this monocled cobra,
and it bit me in the stomach.

00:05:36.600 --> 00:05:38.710 align:middle line:84%
And I got taken to the
hospital, almost died,

00:05:38.710 --> 00:05:43.810 align:middle line:84%
and Miami had to fly in
10 vials of antivenom.

00:05:43.810 --> 00:05:46.360 align:middle line:84%
And they gave it to
me, and I survived.

00:05:46.360 --> 00:05:50.020 align:middle line:84%
And he filmed the whole
thing, even getting bit.

00:05:50.020 --> 00:05:51.873 align:middle line:84%
And I was like, oh
my gosh, because you

00:05:51.873 --> 00:05:54.040 align:middle line:84%
get bit by-- an elephant
gets a bit by one of those,

00:05:54.040 --> 00:05:56.840 align:middle line:84%
and he's done like in
a couple of minutes.

00:05:56.840 --> 00:06:00.743 align:middle line:84%
So he got bit by this,
and I said, yeah.

00:06:00.743 --> 00:06:02.160 align:middle line:84%
I was like, where
did you get bit?

00:06:02.160 --> 00:06:03.700 align:middle line:84%
He's like, right here
on my belly button.

00:06:03.700 --> 00:06:05.200 align:middle line:84%
I was like, OK,
well, let me see it.

00:06:05.200 --> 00:06:07.330 align:middle line:84%
And then he pulls
up this dirty shirt,

00:06:07.330 --> 00:06:11.020 align:middle line:84%
and he's got this
makeshift bandage on.

00:06:11.020 --> 00:06:15.040 align:middle line:84%
And then he pulls it down,
and I was just like, oh.

00:06:15.040 --> 00:06:20.170 align:middle line:84%
I said, this only
works with live tissue.

00:06:20.170 --> 00:06:22.510 align:middle line:84%
It only works on a
tissue that's alive.

00:06:22.510 --> 00:06:24.880 align:middle line:84%
When I make platelet-rich
plasma, I take your blood,

00:06:24.880 --> 00:06:27.940 align:middle line:84%
spin down the platelets, and
concentrate the growth factors.

00:06:27.940 --> 00:06:30.395 align:middle line:84%
And then we make a gel out of
it and put it on your wound,

00:06:30.395 --> 00:06:32.770 align:middle line:84%
and it increases angiogenesis,
the formation of new blood

00:06:32.770 --> 00:06:35.650 align:middle line:84%
vessels, but that's
a whole other course.

00:06:35.650 --> 00:06:39.670 align:middle line:84%
And when I saw that his wound
was black and necrotic and dead

00:06:39.670 --> 00:06:41.260 align:middle line:90%
tissue, and it was oozing.

00:06:41.260 --> 00:06:43.930 align:middle line:84%
And his eyes were yellow,
and he was jaundiced.

00:06:43.930 --> 00:06:46.810 align:middle line:84%
I said, Dave, you need to go to
the emergency room right now,

00:06:46.810 --> 00:06:49.360 align:middle line:84%
because you're probably
going to die within 24 hours.

00:06:49.360 --> 00:06:50.470 align:middle line:84%
You need to get on
some antibiotics

00:06:50.470 --> 00:06:51.845 align:middle line:84%
and admit yourself
at a hospital.

00:06:51.845 --> 00:06:53.770 align:middle line:90%
I'm not touching you.

00:06:53.770 --> 00:06:55.660 align:middle line:84%
And I said, this has
to be cleaned out.

00:06:55.660 --> 00:06:56.785 align:middle line:90%
You've got to clean it out.

00:06:56.785 --> 00:06:59.920 align:middle line:84%
So he comes back, and
we're just were just

00:06:59.920 --> 00:07:01.240 align:middle line:90%
bantering back and forth.

00:07:01.240 --> 00:07:02.532 align:middle line:90%
He's like, do I have to really?

00:07:02.532 --> 00:07:05.040 align:middle line:84%
I was like, you
really have to go.

00:07:05.040 --> 00:07:07.090 align:middle line:84%
I said, go get all
cleaned out, and if it

00:07:07.090 --> 00:07:09.760 align:middle line:84%
looks good in a couple
days, or tomorrow, maybe we

00:07:09.760 --> 00:07:13.210 align:middle line:84%
can make this platelet-rich
plasma for you and put it on.

00:07:13.210 --> 00:07:15.100 align:middle line:90%
So next day, I'm working.

00:07:15.100 --> 00:07:18.140 align:middle line:84%
He comes back, and
he looks great.

00:07:18.140 --> 00:07:21.560 align:middle line:84%
He's like vibrant,
his skin's better.

00:07:21.560 --> 00:07:24.640 align:middle line:84%
He doesn't look jaundiced
at all, and he's all peppy.

00:07:24.640 --> 00:07:28.330 align:middle line:84%
He's like, OK, I did it,
and everything's good.

00:07:28.330 --> 00:07:30.610 align:middle line:90%
Maybe we can do that procedure.

00:07:30.610 --> 00:07:32.830 align:middle line:84%
I said, well, why did
you leave the hospital

00:07:32.830 --> 00:07:36.700 align:middle line:84%
in the first place, after
you got the antivenom?

00:07:36.700 --> 00:07:38.420 align:middle line:84%
And he's like, oh,
man, those doctors,

00:07:38.420 --> 00:07:41.560 align:middle line:90%
I don't give an F about that.

00:07:41.560 --> 00:07:43.350 align:middle line:84%
I can't be in there
more than 24 hours--

00:07:43.350 --> 00:07:48.740 align:middle line:84%
after his kidneys were just
shutting down from the venom.

00:07:48.740 --> 00:07:54.430 align:middle line:84%
And next thing you know, I'm
in one of the operating rooms

00:07:54.430 --> 00:07:59.390 align:middle line:84%
there, stalls, this is
when we first got started.

00:07:59.390 --> 00:08:01.460 align:middle line:84%
And I said, well, lay
down on the table.

00:08:01.460 --> 00:08:02.740 align:middle line:90%
Let's take a look at it.

00:08:02.740 --> 00:08:06.760 align:middle line:84%
And we took the bandages
off, and it was perfectly

00:08:06.760 --> 00:08:09.430 align:middle line:90%
cleaned and incised perfectly.

00:08:09.430 --> 00:08:11.680 align:middle line:84%
You could see down
to his intestine,

00:08:11.680 --> 00:08:14.890 align:middle line:84%
and it was just cleaned
out, and he looked healthy.

00:08:14.890 --> 00:08:17.350 align:middle line:84%
I said, OK, he's
a good candidate,

00:08:17.350 --> 00:08:19.540 align:middle line:90%
and we'll try it out.

00:08:19.540 --> 00:08:21.110 align:middle line:84%
So we took his
blood, spun it down,

00:08:21.110 --> 00:08:23.380 align:middle line:84%
and I'm making
preparing the graft.

00:08:23.380 --> 00:08:25.605 align:middle line:84%
And I'm injecting
this giant hole

00:08:25.605 --> 00:08:28.600 align:middle line:84%
that's about the size
of a softball in there,

00:08:28.600 --> 00:08:30.880 align:middle line:84%
because the tissue
just kills everything,

00:08:30.880 --> 00:08:34.390 align:middle line:84%
and as I'm injecting
this in him.

00:08:34.390 --> 00:08:36.370 align:middle line:84%
I know every doctor
in South Florida.

00:08:36.370 --> 00:08:38.380 align:middle line:84%
I'm like, well, Dave,
I'm really proud that you

00:08:38.380 --> 00:08:39.520 align:middle line:90%
went and did what I said.

00:08:39.520 --> 00:08:42.429 align:middle line:90%
Like who was your doctor?

00:08:42.429 --> 00:08:43.600 align:middle line:90%
And he didn't respond.

00:08:43.600 --> 00:08:44.960 align:middle line:90%
I look at him.

00:08:44.960 --> 00:08:50.230 align:middle line:84%
He's like, oh, man, Em,
I just couldn't do it,

00:08:50.230 --> 00:08:53.950 align:middle line:84%
but I went in the
back, in the vet,

00:08:53.950 --> 00:08:56.800 align:middle line:84%
where we got the penicillin
for the tiger and stuff.

00:08:56.800 --> 00:09:00.510 align:middle line:84%
I just injected myself
with a bunch antibiotics.

00:09:00.510 --> 00:09:02.930 align:middle line:84%
And I said, well, who
did your incision here,

00:09:02.930 --> 00:09:04.960 align:middle line:84%
and who did the
debridement of this wound?

00:09:04.960 --> 00:09:07.150 align:middle line:90%
He's like, well, I did.

00:09:07.150 --> 00:09:08.605 align:middle line:90%
I said, you did?

00:09:08.605 --> 00:09:10.480 align:middle line:84%
He said, yeah, I got my
scissors-- he's like,

00:09:10.480 --> 00:09:13.210 align:middle line:84%
well, I smoked a big
fatty, and then I

00:09:13.210 --> 00:09:16.030 align:middle line:84%
got my scissors
and a razor blade.

00:09:16.030 --> 00:09:18.940 align:middle line:84%
And I just went out,
and I went to it.

00:09:18.940 --> 00:09:21.115 align:middle line:84%
And I'm like, I'm going
to lose my license.

00:09:21.115 --> 00:09:22.240 align:middle line:90%
I'm going to jail tomorrow.

00:09:22.240 --> 00:09:24.620 align:middle line:84%
He's going to get
infected and die.

00:09:24.620 --> 00:09:27.052 align:middle line:84%
And I was just like,
Dave, you can't do that.

00:09:27.052 --> 00:09:28.010 align:middle line:90%
He just grabbed my arm.

00:09:28.010 --> 00:09:29.080 align:middle line:90%
He said, don't worry.

00:09:29.080 --> 00:09:30.270 align:middle line:90%
I used alcohol.

00:09:30.270 --> 00:09:39.300 align:middle line:84%
[LAUGHING] Talk about your
noncompliant patients.

00:09:39.300 --> 00:09:45.870 align:middle line:84%
So we did it, and I'll
tell you the rest of story

00:09:45.870 --> 00:09:47.800 align:middle line:90%
after the clip, what happened.

00:09:47.800 --> 00:09:48.840 align:middle line:90%
You want to see it?

00:09:48.840 --> 00:09:49.290 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:09:49.290 --> 00:09:49.990 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:09:49.990 --> 00:09:50.790 align:middle line:90%
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:09:50.790 --> 00:09:53.520 align:middle line:10%
>> Worried about infection,
David went to see clinical

00:09:53.520 --> 00:09:55.500 align:middle line:10%
specialist Emery Smith.

00:09:55.500 --> 00:09:57.720 align:middle line:84%
Smith was developing
an experimental process

00:09:57.720 --> 00:10:01.120 align:middle line:84%
to accelerate healing called
platelet-rich plasma therapy.

00:10:01.120 --> 00:10:04.920 align:middle line:10%
A gel concentrate is made
from the patient's own blood.

00:10:04.920 --> 00:10:08.570 align:middle line:84%
>> The living cells, we'll
then get a scalpel or a blade

00:10:08.570 --> 00:10:12.330 align:middle line:84%
and we'll cut of specific design
to the patient's own wound

00:10:12.330 --> 00:10:13.260 align:middle line:90%
measurements.

00:10:13.260 --> 00:10:16.590 align:middle line:84%
And then from there, we'll just
pick it up off this Petri dish,

00:10:16.590 --> 00:10:19.590 align:middle line:84%
and we'll place it right
directly onto the wound.

00:10:19.590 --> 00:10:22.860 align:middle line:84%
>> Just one week after
receiving PRP therapy,

00:10:22.860 --> 00:10:26.483 align:middle line:84%
David's condition had
improved dramatically.

00:10:26.483 --> 00:10:28.250 align:middle line:10%
[INAUDIBLE]

00:10:28.250 --> 00:10:30.650 align:middle line:10%
>> When I looked at David's
wound on the seventh day,

00:10:30.650 --> 00:10:34.620 align:middle line:10%
and we took off that bandage, I
was very surprised to see that

00:10:34.620 --> 00:10:39.264 align:middle line:10%
the wound has come to
about 90% rate of healing.

00:10:39.264 --> 00:10:40.590 align:middle line:90%
[END PLAYBACK]

00:10:40.590 --> 00:10:45.680 align:middle line:84%
So we did it, and we did it
with his own healing factors

00:10:45.680 --> 00:10:46.610 align:middle line:90%
from his body.

00:10:46.610 --> 00:10:49.760 align:middle line:84%
We didn't use pharmaceuticals,
we didn't do surgery,

00:10:49.760 --> 00:10:54.320 align:middle line:84%
because you have everything
you need in your DNA

00:10:54.320 --> 00:10:58.430 align:middle line:84%
and all your cells if
you program the right way

00:10:58.430 --> 00:11:03.020 align:middle line:84%
and concentrate the healing
properties of your body

00:11:03.020 --> 00:11:04.430 align:middle line:90%
to heal yourself.

00:11:04.430 --> 00:11:06.950 align:middle line:84%
And that's why I want
you guys to know that,

00:11:06.950 --> 00:11:10.910 align:middle line:84%
because when we start
talking about the projects,

00:11:10.910 --> 00:11:12.600 align:middle line:84%
we learn a lot of
the stuff in there.

00:11:12.600 --> 00:11:15.343 align:middle line:84%
And they don't want
you guys to know that,

00:11:15.343 --> 00:11:16.760 align:middle line:84%
but you guys do
need to know that,

00:11:16.760 --> 00:11:18.770 align:middle line:84%
because it's available
now, now with PRP

00:11:18.770 --> 00:11:22.030 align:middle line:84%
and stem cells and
Alpha 2 macroglobulin,

00:11:22.030 --> 00:11:24.830 align:middle line:84%
all these amazing proteins
that you produce to heal.

00:11:24.830 --> 00:11:30.960 align:middle line:84%
It's just that because of all
this electromagnetic energy

00:11:30.960 --> 00:11:34.800 align:middle line:84%
around, we're getting
bombarded with chemicals

00:11:34.800 --> 00:11:37.990 align:middle line:84%
in the foods we eat, and in
the rugs that we walk on,

00:11:37.990 --> 00:11:39.270 align:middle line:90%
and everywhere.

00:11:39.270 --> 00:11:41.370 align:middle line:84%
But it's OK,
because we're tough.

00:11:41.370 --> 00:11:43.980 align:middle line:84%
Humans are one of the
toughest species that I

00:11:43.980 --> 00:11:46.400 align:middle line:90%
know in this whole universe.

00:11:46.400 --> 00:11:51.210 align:middle line:84%
And ETs look at us like we're
the superheroes, because we

00:11:51.210 --> 00:11:53.940 align:middle line:84%
can survive through
many things, and we can

00:11:53.940 --> 00:11:57.120 align:middle line:90%
adapt to many different things.

00:11:57.120 --> 00:11:58.410 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, 5G is coming.

00:11:58.410 --> 00:11:59.370 align:middle line:84%
Everyone's kind
of, oh, Emery, what

00:11:59.370 --> 00:12:00.537 align:middle line:90%
are we going to do about 5G?

00:12:00.537 --> 00:12:02.430 align:middle line:90%
Oh, not going to do anything.

00:12:02.430 --> 00:12:04.140 align:middle line:84%
It's OK it's coming,
and it's here.

00:12:04.140 --> 00:12:08.250 align:middle line:84%
It's not good for us, but your
body has an incredible ability

00:12:08.250 --> 00:12:10.170 align:middle line:90%
to adapt to that.

00:12:10.170 --> 00:12:11.995 align:middle line:84%
And there's ways
that we're going

00:12:11.995 --> 00:12:13.620 align:middle line:84%
to be talking about
that in the future,

00:12:13.620 --> 00:12:16.380 align:middle line:84%
of how you guys can do that
for yourself to increase

00:12:16.380 --> 00:12:18.690 align:middle line:90%
that energy field around you.

00:12:18.690 --> 00:12:19.675 align:middle line:90%
Right, Randy?

00:12:19.675 --> 00:12:20.475 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes, sir.

00:12:20.475 --> 00:12:22.360 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:12:22.360 --> 00:12:23.160 align:middle line:90%
>> I feel honored.

00:12:23.160 --> 00:12:25.800 align:middle line:84%
It's the first time
you called me sir.

00:12:25.800 --> 00:12:28.082 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:12:28.082 --> 00:12:30.040 align:middle line:84%
Randy Veitenheimer, homer
ladies and gentlemen.

00:12:30.040 --> 00:12:33.512 align:middle line:90%
[APPLAUSE]

00:12:33.512 --> 00:12:35.500 align:middle line:90%


00:12:35.500 --> 00:12:39.622 align:middle line:84%
He is my main mentor
of a very long time.

00:12:39.622 --> 00:12:41.830 align:middle line:84%
You'll see, if you're going
to stick around tomorrow,

00:12:41.830 --> 00:12:42.955 align:middle line:90%
we're going to have a show.

00:12:42.955 --> 00:12:46.390 align:middle line:84%
Him and I are going to be doing
really on stage amazing talk,

00:12:46.390 --> 00:12:47.960 align:middle line:90%
if you're here.

00:12:47.960 --> 00:12:52.090 align:middle line:84%
But let's get back into
this stuff, the fun stuff.

00:12:52.090 --> 00:12:54.760 align:middle line:84%
And it's kind like
a show and shell.

00:12:54.760 --> 00:12:57.350 align:middle line:84%
It reminds me of back in
kindergarten when they said,

00:12:57.350 --> 00:12:59.600 align:middle line:84%
hey, Emery, it's
show and tell day.

00:12:59.600 --> 00:13:01.157 align:middle line:84%
You got to bring
something from home.

00:13:01.157 --> 00:13:02.740 align:middle line:84%
Now, they didn't put
any restrictions.

00:13:02.740 --> 00:13:05.960 align:middle line:84%
I didn't read any restrictions
on that in kindergarten,

00:13:05.960 --> 00:13:06.985 align:middle line:90%
so I brought--

00:13:06.985 --> 00:13:09.610 align:middle line:84%
I remember going out to the pond
and getting my mayonnaise jar,

00:13:09.610 --> 00:13:14.492 align:middle line:84%
filling it full of minnows, a
couple of frogs, a couple farm

00:13:14.492 --> 00:13:15.700 align:middle line:90%
animals, bring them in there.

00:13:15.700 --> 00:13:17.560 align:middle line:84%
And of course, they're
all my duffel bag,

00:13:17.560 --> 00:13:21.640 align:middle line:84%
running around in there, and
pooping and peeing in there.

00:13:21.640 --> 00:13:23.470 align:middle line:84%
And I get up to the
table and break it out,

00:13:23.470 --> 00:13:25.400 align:middle line:84%
and chickens are flying,
and the minnows--

00:13:25.400 --> 00:13:26.530 align:middle line:84%
the jar fell on the
ground, and the minnows

00:13:26.530 --> 00:13:27.363 align:middle line:90%
are flopping around.

00:13:27.363 --> 00:13:31.630 align:middle line:84%
And she said, "Emery, you
pick up these animals,

00:13:31.630 --> 00:13:34.750 align:middle line:84%
and take them outside,
and let them go."

00:13:34.750 --> 00:13:37.390 align:middle line:84%
But, and that's what we're
going to do right now.

00:13:37.390 --> 00:13:42.400 align:middle line:84%
We're going to-- [LAUGHS] I
was a little eccentric child.

00:13:42.400 --> 00:13:44.360 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:13:44.360 --> 00:13:46.810 align:middle line:90%
So there are these--

00:13:46.810 --> 00:13:49.015 align:middle line:90%
this is just one of the--

00:13:49.015 --> 00:13:51.880 align:middle line:84%
and Gaia, by the way, pretty
much all these pictures,

00:13:51.880 --> 00:13:56.020 align:middle line:84%
so you know, Gaia has
helped make it possible.

00:13:56.020 --> 00:13:58.870 align:middle line:84%
So thank you, Gaia,
for doing that for me.

00:13:58.870 --> 00:14:01.210 align:middle line:84%
And this is just
one of the opening,

00:14:01.210 --> 00:14:04.930 align:middle line:84%
but I like it, because
it depicts hallways,

00:14:04.930 --> 00:14:07.330 align:middle line:84%
and there's a lot of lit
hallways in the project.

00:14:07.330 --> 00:14:10.630 align:middle line:84%
So when I check in in
the morning, or night,

00:14:10.630 --> 00:14:15.340 align:middle line:84%
or whenever it is, the hallways
have lights embedded into them.

00:14:15.340 --> 00:14:19.730 align:middle line:84%
And you might be
working in Red 45 today,

00:14:19.730 --> 00:14:22.960 align:middle line:84%
so I'll follow the red line
when the doors open and go

00:14:22.960 --> 00:14:26.240 align:middle line:90%
to OR 45, this chamber.

00:14:26.240 --> 00:14:28.865 align:middle line:84%
And you just follow the line to
wherever you're supposed to go.

00:14:28.865 --> 00:14:31.450 align:middle line:90%
Well, it might be Blue 27.

00:14:31.450 --> 00:14:33.710 align:middle line:84%
So I like it, that they
put these lights there.

00:14:33.710 --> 00:14:38.170 align:middle line:84%
I mean, this is more '80s style
neon graphics, but you get--

00:14:38.170 --> 00:14:39.700 align:middle line:90%
it's more inlaid into the--

00:14:39.700 --> 00:14:40.060 align:middle line:90%
and in there.

00:14:40.060 --> 00:14:41.590 align:middle line:84%
And you do have
these types of suits

00:14:41.590 --> 00:14:43.263 align:middle line:84%
that people are
walking around in,

00:14:43.263 --> 00:14:44.680 align:middle line:84%
but they're a
little bit different

00:14:44.680 --> 00:14:46.810 align:middle line:84%
when you get into the rooms,
into the actual operating

00:14:46.810 --> 00:14:47.610 align:middle line:90%
rooms.

00:14:47.610 --> 00:14:49.770 align:middle line:84%
Now, I'm going to
be jumping around

00:14:49.770 --> 00:14:51.900 align:middle line:84%
from the bases that
are underground

00:14:51.900 --> 00:14:54.030 align:middle line:84%
to the extraterrestrials
that we've captured.

00:14:54.030 --> 00:14:58.320 align:middle line:10%
Now, this is a rendition
of an actual photo

00:14:58.320 --> 00:15:03.810 align:middle line:10%
that we will post
online here soon of a--

00:15:03.810 --> 00:15:06.480 align:middle line:10%
it's a bird type of
extraterrestrial.

00:15:06.480 --> 00:15:09.390 align:middle line:84%
It was witnessed by many
people during a CE-5 expedition

00:15:09.390 --> 00:15:12.810 align:middle line:84%
in Florida when we were
doing some contact work.

00:15:12.810 --> 00:15:18.660 align:middle line:84%
And it came right in, and it
had these types of talons on it,

00:15:18.660 --> 00:15:24.780 align:middle line:84%
and it looked like one of those
prehistoric dinosaur birds.

00:15:24.780 --> 00:15:29.760 align:middle line:84%
And it had this long head
on it with these big eyes.

00:15:29.760 --> 00:15:33.000 align:middle line:84%
And it came in, this
type of ET avian.

00:15:33.000 --> 00:15:33.910 align:middle line:10%
And there's many--

00:15:33.910 --> 00:15:36.630 align:middle line:10%
I know my colleagues
out there have

00:15:36.630 --> 00:15:38.760 align:middle line:10%
drawn these pictures
of their avians,

00:15:38.760 --> 00:15:41.363 align:middle line:10%
but I've never seen
that kind of avian

00:15:41.363 --> 00:15:42.780 align:middle line:10%
that my colleagues
have mentioned,

00:15:42.780 --> 00:15:44.320 align:middle line:10%
not say they don't exist.

00:15:44.320 --> 00:15:50.010 align:middle line:10%
But this is a true one with
wings that may or may not

00:15:50.010 --> 00:15:53.340 align:middle line:10%
be able to fly, but it was
actually standing upright.

00:15:53.340 --> 00:15:54.840 align:middle line:10%
But this kind of
gives you an idea.

00:15:54.840 --> 00:15:57.600 align:middle line:84%
And these are the eyes,
so you can see that it's

00:15:57.600 --> 00:15:59.190 align:middle line:90%
like a pterodactyl here.

00:15:59.190 --> 00:16:01.800 align:middle line:10%
And this is the head,
this is the nose.

00:16:01.800 --> 00:16:04.290 align:middle line:10%
This is-- and on the
on the actual picture,

00:16:04.290 --> 00:16:06.170 align:middle line:10%
it is-- you can't
see the wings fully,

00:16:06.170 --> 00:16:09.630 align:middle line:10%
so they did a great job
by just tuning it up

00:16:09.630 --> 00:16:11.970 align:middle line:10%
so you can see the talons.

00:16:11.970 --> 00:16:14.580 align:middle line:84%
And it was holding a device
which is not in the picture,

00:16:14.580 --> 00:16:16.790 align:middle line:84%
but like I said,
follow emerysmith.net,

00:16:16.790 --> 00:16:19.290 align:middle line:84%
and we're going to be
posting that picture soon.

00:16:19.290 --> 00:16:21.720 align:middle line:84%
And it had a cylindrical
item in one of the hands.

00:16:21.720 --> 00:16:22.890 align:middle line:90%
It was really interesting.

00:16:22.890 --> 00:16:25.320 align:middle line:10%
And it was witnessed
by over 30 people.

00:16:25.320 --> 00:16:29.560 align:middle line:90%


00:16:29.560 --> 00:16:32.350 align:middle line:10%
Now, these types of
geometric shapes you're

00:16:32.350 --> 00:16:37.090 align:middle line:10%
going to be seeing on here do
all sorts of different things,

00:16:37.090 --> 00:16:39.250 align:middle line:10%
and we're going to get
a little bit into that,

00:16:39.250 --> 00:16:42.490 align:middle line:10%
but most of these have
to do with making energy.

00:16:42.490 --> 00:16:46.030 align:middle line:10%
And I don't know
specifically how it works,

00:16:46.030 --> 00:16:49.840 align:middle line:10%
but I did visualize this
on one of the crafts

00:16:49.840 --> 00:16:54.470 align:middle line:10%
and also, in a
compartmentalized area.

00:16:54.470 --> 00:16:56.290 align:middle line:10%
And it had a blue
ball in it, and it

00:16:56.290 --> 00:17:00.130 align:middle line:10%
had this beautiful pyramid,
and it was rotating, this ball,

00:17:00.130 --> 00:17:03.520 align:middle line:10%
and giving off light, and it
was actually just hovering.

00:17:03.520 --> 00:17:07.210 align:middle line:10%
And a lot of the craft
have crystals on them

00:17:07.210 --> 00:17:08.755 align:middle line:10%
and also give off this light.

00:17:08.755 --> 00:17:13.960 align:middle line:90%


00:17:13.960 --> 00:17:15.230 align:middle line:10%
This is great.

00:17:15.230 --> 00:17:18.200 align:middle line:84%
This was one of
the first craft I

00:17:18.200 --> 00:17:21.786 align:middle line:84%
saw when I was about seven years
of age, and I walked outside.

00:17:21.786 --> 00:17:23.119 align:middle line:90%
Something told me to go outside.

00:17:23.119 --> 00:17:26.270 align:middle line:90%
It was around 9:30, 10:30 PM.

00:17:26.270 --> 00:17:29.000 align:middle line:84%
And I walked outside, and
I lived on a little lake,

00:17:29.000 --> 00:17:30.000 align:middle line:90%
and there was a dock.

00:17:30.000 --> 00:17:34.310 align:middle line:84%
And I remember walking out and
seeing this round orb come down

00:17:34.310 --> 00:17:35.810 align:middle line:90%
and turn into an oval.

00:17:35.810 --> 00:17:38.360 align:middle line:84%
And I saw these
three human beings,

00:17:38.360 --> 00:17:40.490 align:middle line:90%
human-like beings in it.

00:17:40.490 --> 00:17:44.840 align:middle line:84%
And they were very,
very albino looking,

00:17:44.840 --> 00:17:47.900 align:middle line:84%
but they looked like
people, like normal people.

00:17:47.900 --> 00:17:49.370 align:middle line:90%
They have weird ears.

00:17:49.370 --> 00:17:52.402 align:middle line:84%
And it was pretty
far away, about 100,

00:17:52.402 --> 00:17:55.160 align:middle line:90%
about 300 feet away, 100 yards.

00:17:55.160 --> 00:17:57.860 align:middle line:84%
And I just was just
mesmerized by this,

00:17:57.860 --> 00:18:00.470 align:middle line:84%
and looking at it,
and all of a sudden,

00:18:00.470 --> 00:18:05.100 align:middle line:84%
I started hearing
this communication.

00:18:05.100 --> 00:18:06.150 align:middle line:90%
It wasn't a voice.

00:18:06.150 --> 00:18:08.850 align:middle line:84%
It was just a knowing of
what they were saying,

00:18:08.850 --> 00:18:11.520 align:middle line:90%
and I was like, are you real?

00:18:11.520 --> 00:18:15.240 align:middle line:84%
And I was receiving
the feeling of yes,

00:18:15.240 --> 00:18:20.010 align:middle line:84%
of course we're real, and had
this really short conversation

00:18:20.010 --> 00:18:20.940 align:middle line:90%
going.

00:18:20.940 --> 00:18:24.870 align:middle line:84%
And then it just enfolded in
on itself, and it was gone.

00:18:24.870 --> 00:18:26.790 align:middle line:84%
So of course, I did
the right thing,

00:18:26.790 --> 00:18:28.860 align:middle line:84%
and turned around, and
walked into the house,

00:18:28.860 --> 00:18:32.990 align:middle line:84%
and banged on my mom and dad's
door while they were sleeping.

00:18:32.990 --> 00:18:36.000 align:middle line:84%
And I woke them up, and I
said, there's this craft,

00:18:36.000 --> 00:18:40.840 align:middle line:84%
this spaceship over
the lake outside.

00:18:40.840 --> 00:18:44.860 align:middle line:84%
And they both were
looking at me.

00:18:44.860 --> 00:18:49.750 align:middle line:84%
They said, OK, but just
don't tell anyone about it.

00:18:49.750 --> 00:18:51.400 align:middle line:84%
I said, OK, I won't,
and I went to bed.

00:18:51.400 --> 00:18:57.240 align:middle line:90%


00:18:57.240 --> 00:18:58.830 align:middle line:84%
Now, there's many
different types

00:18:58.830 --> 00:19:00.660 align:middle line:90%
of species in the universe.

00:19:00.660 --> 00:19:03.780 align:middle line:84%
And I was talking about this
yesterday with my colleagues.

00:19:03.780 --> 00:19:05.670 align:middle line:84%
And if you guys saw
me with Jimmy Church

00:19:05.670 --> 00:19:09.870 align:middle line:84%
on the panel the other
day, and I appreciate you

00:19:09.870 --> 00:19:11.520 align:middle line:84%
guys coming up to
let me know you're

00:19:11.520 --> 00:19:17.620 align:middle line:84%
a Pleiadian for an Arcturian,
or you're in Inner Earth being.

00:19:17.620 --> 00:19:18.960 align:middle line:90%
That's great.

00:19:18.960 --> 00:19:20.930 align:middle line:90%
I'm really thankful you're here.

00:19:20.930 --> 00:19:22.770 align:middle line:84%
And I'm serious about
that, because there

00:19:22.770 --> 00:19:25.860 align:middle line:84%
is a part of you that
is probably from there,

00:19:25.860 --> 00:19:30.120 align:middle line:84%
but these star systems have
trillions of stars in them,

00:19:30.120 --> 00:19:34.920 align:middle line:84%
so the Pleiades has millions and
trillions of planets out there.

00:19:34.920 --> 00:19:37.520 align:middle line:84%
So to say you're
from this section,

00:19:37.520 --> 00:19:41.810 align:middle line:90%
I mean, from this star is--

00:19:41.810 --> 00:19:44.600 align:middle line:84%
it's a lot bigger
than that, guys, OK?

00:19:44.600 --> 00:19:47.200 align:middle line:84%
So start thinking about
that in the projects.

00:19:47.200 --> 00:19:50.380 align:middle line:84%
We have sectors, so we
can split open Arcturus,

00:19:50.380 --> 00:19:52.570 align:middle line:84%
and open up that
system, and then

00:19:52.570 --> 00:19:54.400 align:middle line:84%
see all the suns
in that system, see

00:19:54.400 --> 00:19:56.390 align:middle line:90%
all the planets in that system.

00:19:56.390 --> 00:20:01.710 align:middle line:84%
So when they are
collecting these EDEs,

00:20:01.710 --> 00:20:03.710 align:middle line:84%
and they have an idea
where they're coming from,

00:20:03.710 --> 00:20:04.810 align:middle line:90%
they start numbering them.

00:20:04.810 --> 00:20:10.690 align:middle line:84%
So it'll be sector
whatever, 7,927.

00:20:10.690 --> 00:20:12.490 align:middle line:84%
And that's how they
start labeling them.

00:20:12.490 --> 00:20:13.630 align:middle line:90%
They don't say, oh, Emery?

00:20:13.630 --> 00:20:15.280 align:middle line:84%
Today, you're working
on a Pleiadian

00:20:15.280 --> 00:20:17.150 align:middle line:90%
who fell out of this craft.

00:20:17.150 --> 00:20:19.280 align:middle line:84%
No, it doesn't work
like that at all.

00:20:19.280 --> 00:20:21.850 align:middle line:84%
It's all numbered, and
it's very specific.

00:20:21.850 --> 00:20:24.390 align:middle line:90%


00:20:24.390 --> 00:20:29.540 align:middle line:84%
They sometimes have these suits
on, and sometimes they don't.

00:20:29.540 --> 00:20:32.990 align:middle line:10%
It's a very skintight suit.

00:20:32.990 --> 00:20:34.550 align:middle line:10%
It could be the same
color sometimes.

00:20:34.550 --> 00:20:38.050 align:middle line:84%
You would think it
would be like a suit.

00:20:38.050 --> 00:20:39.050 align:middle line:90%
Here's different colors.

00:20:39.050 --> 00:20:42.980 align:middle line:84%
But a lot of what I've noticed,
a lot of the attire they wear

00:20:42.980 --> 00:20:46.430 align:middle line:90%
is the same color as their skin.

00:20:46.430 --> 00:20:47.930 align:middle line:84%
It's like another
membrane that's

00:20:47.930 --> 00:20:52.880 align:middle line:84%
formed around them that we
found out through sound.

00:20:52.880 --> 00:20:54.540 align:middle line:84%
So it's not something
that has zippers

00:20:54.540 --> 00:20:56.360 align:middle line:90%
that you can take off and on.

00:20:56.360 --> 00:20:58.070 align:middle line:84%
It somehow forms
around them, and they

00:20:58.070 --> 00:21:03.350 align:middle line:84%
use harmonic frequencies to
form these suits around them,

00:21:03.350 --> 00:21:05.870 align:middle line:84%
and the suits are
alive as well, and have

00:21:05.870 --> 00:21:08.870 align:middle line:84%
all sorts of amazing
nanotechnology in them,

00:21:08.870 --> 00:21:12.670 align:middle line:84%
and regulate the body
in many different ways.

00:21:12.670 --> 00:21:15.450 align:middle line:84%
This is a famous one
that was very gelatinous.

00:21:15.450 --> 00:21:19.800 align:middle line:84%
And this being,
when it came to us,

00:21:19.800 --> 00:21:23.280 align:middle line:84%
the most fascinating thing
about this being is it

00:21:23.280 --> 00:21:24.640 align:middle line:90%
had to have a special--

00:21:24.640 --> 00:21:28.680 align:middle line:84%
these, our operating
rooms, are pressurized.

00:21:28.680 --> 00:21:32.670 align:middle line:84%
And it depends on where
the being came from

00:21:32.670 --> 00:21:35.130 align:middle line:84%
and its atmosphere
conditions on the craft which

00:21:35.130 --> 00:21:37.590 align:middle line:84%
they can measure by
flying a drone over it

00:21:37.590 --> 00:21:38.970 align:middle line:90%
or using a satellite.

00:21:38.970 --> 00:21:43.650 align:middle line:84%
So when a craft crashes, before
we even get there, we already

00:21:43.650 --> 00:21:47.710 align:middle line:84%
know what it's emitting, is
it a harmful area, is there

00:21:47.710 --> 00:21:52.890 align:middle line:84%
radiation, is there some sort of
toxin or chemicals in the area

00:21:52.890 --> 00:21:55.140 align:middle line:84%
there way before
we even get there.

00:21:55.140 --> 00:21:57.840 align:middle line:10%
And that's all
done by satellite.

00:21:57.840 --> 00:22:00.240 align:middle line:10%
They can see right now
what kind of termites

00:22:00.240 --> 00:22:02.750 align:middle line:10%
are living inside your--

00:22:02.750 --> 00:22:05.900 align:middle line:10%
and that's all public
information, by the way.

00:22:05.900 --> 00:22:07.803 align:middle line:84%
What kind of termites
are living your walls.

00:22:07.803 --> 00:22:09.720 align:middle line:84%
So they can zoom in and
see all sorts of stuff

00:22:09.720 --> 00:22:13.230 align:middle line:90%
and measure this density.

00:22:13.230 --> 00:22:15.530 align:middle line:84%
And this being, which
was interesting,

00:22:15.530 --> 00:22:17.370 align:middle line:90%
it was very gelatinous.

00:22:17.370 --> 00:22:21.060 align:middle line:10%
And I remember working with
another human extraterrestrial

00:22:21.060 --> 00:22:25.870 align:middle line:10%
during the tissue
harvesting on this being.

00:22:25.870 --> 00:22:29.130 align:middle line:10%
And it was one of the first
times where I was brought out

00:22:29.130 --> 00:22:31.770 align:middle line:10%
of the Biologics
Department and was

00:22:31.770 --> 00:22:36.390 align:middle line:10%
taken to the craft
of this being, which

00:22:36.390 --> 00:22:39.180 align:middle line:10%
looked like a like a--
you know the Jell-O

00:22:39.180 --> 00:22:41.067 align:middle line:10%
cakes with the molds?

00:22:41.067 --> 00:22:42.900 align:middle line:84%
It looked like one of
those, and it was red,

00:22:42.900 --> 00:22:45.990 align:middle line:84%
and it was very large,
about size this room

00:22:45.990 --> 00:22:48.360 align:middle line:90%
with a hollow center.

00:22:48.360 --> 00:22:53.100 align:middle line:84%
And what was interesting was
that the genetics of this being

00:22:53.100 --> 00:22:58.470 align:middle line:84%
match the genetics of the
craft, and it's a craft.

00:22:58.470 --> 00:23:01.620 align:middle line:84%
So at this time, when
I started learning more

00:23:01.620 --> 00:23:04.800 align:middle line:84%
about the crafts
in the projects,

00:23:04.800 --> 00:23:08.220 align:middle line:84%
we learned that they're
growing the crafts in space,

00:23:08.220 --> 00:23:14.610 align:middle line:84%
in the vacuum of space, and that
they have this genetic makeup

00:23:14.610 --> 00:23:16.800 align:middle line:90%
of the usually, the beings.

00:23:16.800 --> 00:23:18.690 align:middle line:84%
And I can tell you
some of the craft I've

00:23:18.690 --> 00:23:20.460 align:middle line:90%
been on are very conscious.

00:23:20.460 --> 00:23:25.590 align:middle line:84%
You are aware that the
craft is actually alive,

00:23:25.590 --> 00:23:30.234 align:middle line:84%
and it communicates in
many different ways to you.

00:23:30.234 --> 00:23:32.244 align:middle line:90%
Isn't that cool?

00:23:32.244 --> 00:23:37.960 align:middle line:90%
Oh, don't get into that one.

00:23:37.960 --> 00:23:42.090 align:middle line:10%
Now, this reminded me
of the pterodactyl ET,

00:23:42.090 --> 00:23:46.440 align:middle line:10%
because it had this
long protrusion.

00:23:46.440 --> 00:23:51.370 align:middle line:84%
And when we do the scans on
these things, on this one,

00:23:51.370 --> 00:23:54.990 align:middle line:84%
it was all honeycombed
inside and basically, hollow.

00:23:54.990 --> 00:23:59.690 align:middle line:84%
And they realized that that
was like a type of antenna,

00:23:59.690 --> 00:24:07.590 align:middle line:84%
like some of the dolphins have
in their skulls for harmonics,

00:24:07.590 --> 00:24:11.700 align:middle line:84%
and this is how they
communicated with the universe.

00:24:11.700 --> 00:24:14.790 align:middle line:90%
They're always connected.

00:24:14.790 --> 00:24:15.930 align:middle line:90%
They're very interesting.

00:24:15.930 --> 00:24:17.400 align:middle line:84%
I don't know where
they came from.

00:24:17.400 --> 00:24:19.560 align:middle line:90%
A lot of times when we doing--

00:24:19.560 --> 00:24:21.480 align:middle line:84%
when I get to see
something-- and of course, I

00:24:21.480 --> 00:24:25.680 align:middle line:84%
had to recall this
from 25 years ago,

00:24:25.680 --> 00:24:27.640 align:middle line:84%
that we're not really
allowed to ask, well,

00:24:27.640 --> 00:24:29.390 align:middle line:84%
where did it come--
people are like, well,

00:24:29.390 --> 00:24:30.690 align:middle line:84%
why don't find out
where it came from?

00:24:30.690 --> 00:24:31.740 align:middle line:90%
You can't ask that.

00:24:31.740 --> 00:24:36.900 align:middle line:84%
You're there to get a skin
sample, get a nerve sample,

00:24:36.900 --> 00:24:38.460 align:middle line:90%
and that's it, and not ask.

00:24:38.460 --> 00:24:41.110 align:middle line:84%
And the more you keep her
mouth shut every quarter,

00:24:41.110 --> 00:24:46.140 align:middle line:84%
you will get a bump up in
your security clearance.

00:24:46.140 --> 00:24:49.170 align:middle line:84%
So I started keeping
my mouth shut.

00:24:49.170 --> 00:24:53.330 align:middle line:84%
And if you don't keep your mouth
shut, you can get in trouble,

00:24:53.330 --> 00:24:54.705 align:middle line:90%
and I did get in trouble twice.

00:24:54.705 --> 00:24:57.290 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:24:57.290 --> 00:24:58.690 align:middle line:90%


00:24:58.690 --> 00:25:03.300 align:middle line:84%
They used a scalar and
photometry device on me

00:25:03.300 --> 00:25:05.790 align:middle line:90%
that made me incredibly sick.

00:25:05.790 --> 00:25:09.780 align:middle line:84%
They did it after I signed
out of the facility.

00:25:09.780 --> 00:25:12.120 align:middle line:84%
And I was on my
mountain bike, and I

00:25:12.120 --> 00:25:14.970 align:middle line:84%
was actually riding
around the facility,

00:25:14.970 --> 00:25:18.300 align:middle line:90%
because I was being nosy.

00:25:18.300 --> 00:25:21.310 align:middle line:84%
This was at Kirtland
Air Force Base.

00:25:21.310 --> 00:25:23.080 align:middle line:90%
And I was wondering--

00:25:23.080 --> 00:25:25.660 align:middle line:84%
and it's that big mountain
there with eight fences,

00:25:25.660 --> 00:25:27.910 align:middle line:84%
and the dogs, and the
electric where they used

00:25:27.910 --> 00:25:30.190 align:middle line:90%
to keep all the nukes in there.

00:25:30.190 --> 00:25:32.280 align:middle line:84%
Anyone know what I'm
talking about over there?

00:25:32.280 --> 00:25:33.400 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:25:33.400 --> 00:25:36.500 align:middle line:84%
So I decided-- and
it's a mountain.

00:25:36.500 --> 00:25:39.160 align:middle line:84%
There's a mountain biking
trail around this area,

00:25:39.160 --> 00:25:43.750 align:middle line:84%
but you shouldn't
go off the trail

00:25:43.750 --> 00:25:47.200 align:middle line:84%
and investigate that,
because the next thing

00:25:47.200 --> 00:25:52.230 align:middle line:84%
you know, I'm getting heated
up like a microwave on my bike,

00:25:52.230 --> 00:25:56.500 align:middle line:84%
and I'm still six, seven
miles away from my dorm.

00:25:56.500 --> 00:25:59.890 align:middle line:84%
And the time I got back to
my dorm, I was keeled over,

00:25:59.890 --> 00:26:03.600 align:middle line:84%
and I was begging
God to take my life.

00:26:03.600 --> 00:26:07.350 align:middle line:84%
And I was thinking maybe
that's what it was, that I made

00:26:07.350 --> 00:26:10.110 align:middle line:90%
a mistake, but I wasn't sure.

00:26:10.110 --> 00:26:13.890 align:middle line:84%
Maybe I just had appendicitis,
but it definitely

00:26:13.890 --> 00:26:14.950 align:middle line:90%
wasn't the case.

00:26:14.950 --> 00:26:18.960 align:middle line:84%
And then I became unconscious,
and I woke up the next--

00:26:18.960 --> 00:26:23.010 align:middle line:84%
maybe a couple hours later
in still not too much pain.

00:26:23.010 --> 00:26:27.495 align:middle line:84%
And then they called me in the
next day, and they told me.

00:26:27.495 --> 00:26:29.120 align:middle line:84%
They said, how did
you feel last night?

00:26:29.120 --> 00:26:30.470 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:26:30.470 --> 00:26:31.890 align:middle line:90%
>> Wow.

00:26:31.890 --> 00:26:34.550 align:middle line:90%
>> And that was really scary.

00:26:34.550 --> 00:26:37.620 align:middle line:84%
So they said, yeah,
don't do that, Smith.

00:26:37.620 --> 00:26:42.000 align:middle line:84%
Go ride your bike
somewhere else.

00:26:42.000 --> 00:26:43.150 align:middle line:90%
So these reptilians.

00:26:43.150 --> 00:26:45.280 align:middle line:84%
There's made different
types of reptilians

00:26:45.280 --> 00:26:47.837 align:middle line:84%
that I saw that
I was exposed to.

00:26:47.837 --> 00:26:49.670 align:middle line:10%
The interesting thing
about these reptilians

00:26:49.670 --> 00:26:51.980 align:middle line:10%
is they have these pets.

00:26:51.980 --> 00:26:53.600 align:middle line:10%
And a lot of these
things you see

00:26:53.600 --> 00:26:56.210 align:middle line:10%
on the extraterrestrials
you think

00:26:56.210 --> 00:27:00.650 align:middle line:10%
is jewelry, or maybe a clothing,
or some sort of apparel,

00:27:00.650 --> 00:27:01.790 align:middle line:10%
and it's not.

00:27:01.790 --> 00:27:03.650 align:middle line:10%
It's actually another
living creature.

00:27:03.650 --> 00:27:04.850 align:middle line:10%
They have pets.

00:27:04.850 --> 00:27:07.410 align:middle line:10%
They actually have ET pets.

00:27:07.410 --> 00:27:09.798 align:middle line:10%
And this one kind of joins
together like a lock,

00:27:09.798 --> 00:27:11.840 align:middle line:10%
and then when it opens
up, it has its little cone

00:27:11.840 --> 00:27:15.510 align:middle line:10%
head kind of like a
snake but more rounded.

00:27:15.510 --> 00:27:19.650 align:middle line:84%
It has it actually
has a face on it.

00:27:19.650 --> 00:27:23.010 align:middle line:10%
And I don't know exactly
because it wasn't alive,

00:27:23.010 --> 00:27:24.680 align:middle line:10%
the one I've seen.

00:27:24.680 --> 00:27:27.950 align:middle line:10%
But I did see videos, ancient--

00:27:27.950 --> 00:27:31.250 align:middle line:10%
not ancient, but old
videos from before I

00:27:31.250 --> 00:27:34.370 align:middle line:10%
came on board that I was privy
to see many different types

00:27:34.370 --> 00:27:38.360 align:middle line:10%
of these ET pets that are
found near the crash sites

00:27:38.360 --> 00:27:40.730 align:middle line:10%
or attached to the
extraterrestrial.

00:27:40.730 --> 00:27:44.180 align:middle line:84%
So this kind of snake thing
was around this one here.

00:27:44.180 --> 00:27:48.810 align:middle line:90%


00:27:48.810 --> 00:27:53.070 align:middle line:84%
Oh, well, I'm going
to jump into portals,

00:27:53.070 --> 00:27:54.690 align:middle line:90%
portal technologies real quick.

00:27:54.690 --> 00:27:57.180 align:middle line:90%
I'm going to be jumping around.

00:27:57.180 --> 00:28:01.950 align:middle line:84%
So there's many different
places around the planet that

00:28:01.950 --> 00:28:06.420 align:middle line:84%
have energy signatures that
allow you to time travel,

00:28:06.420 --> 00:28:08.340 align:middle line:84%
or walk into
different dimensions,

00:28:08.340 --> 00:28:12.060 align:middle line:84%
or if the alignment is right
in the universe at that time,

00:28:12.060 --> 00:28:14.070 align:middle line:84%
that you can walk
into these areas

00:28:14.070 --> 00:28:18.150 align:middle line:84%
and then find yourself on
another part of this planet

00:28:18.150 --> 00:28:20.170 align:middle line:84%
or possibly, maybe
another planet.

00:28:20.170 --> 00:28:24.150 align:middle line:84%
Now, I cannot verify if
I was on another planet.

00:28:24.150 --> 00:28:28.020 align:middle line:84%
All I can tell you,
it was very different.

00:28:28.020 --> 00:28:33.000 align:middle line:84%
Some places actually looked
like maybe was inside the Earth.

00:28:33.000 --> 00:28:34.890 align:middle line:84%
But were there for
one thing, and that

00:28:34.890 --> 00:28:38.910 align:middle line:84%
is to collect specimens
and to get readings.

00:28:38.910 --> 00:28:43.020 align:middle line:84%
And we have these amazing suits
that are completely contained,

00:28:43.020 --> 00:28:46.920 align:middle line:84%
and everyone knows where
everyone's at all the time.

00:28:46.920 --> 00:28:49.810 align:middle line:84%
And sometimes, we actually
bring canine units with us,

00:28:49.810 --> 00:28:54.810 align:middle line:84%
too that have special
abilities to protect us.

00:28:54.810 --> 00:28:59.310 align:middle line:84%
We also have cybernetic
organisms and robots

00:28:59.310 --> 00:29:01.650 align:middle line:84%
that actually can go
through these portals,

00:29:01.650 --> 00:29:03.000 align:middle line:90%
and these portals are located--

00:29:03.000 --> 00:29:05.760 align:middle line:84%
some are man made that
are man made on top

00:29:05.760 --> 00:29:07.950 align:middle line:90%
of very, very ancient sites.

00:29:07.950 --> 00:29:12.660 align:middle line:84%
And they're trying to reproduce
what was already there,

00:29:12.660 --> 00:29:17.520 align:middle line:84%
and harvest that
energy electronically.

00:29:17.520 --> 00:29:22.080 align:middle line:84%
And we have teams of anywhere
from four to eight people

00:29:22.080 --> 00:29:27.030 align:middle line:84%
that go through these
portals to collect specimens.

00:29:27.030 --> 00:29:31.020 align:middle line:84%
And I was privy enough to be
on a couple of these teams,

00:29:31.020 --> 00:29:36.870 align:middle line:84%
and it was one of most amazing
things I have ever encountered.

00:29:36.870 --> 00:29:39.300 align:middle line:10%
So you have all this
equipment, and you

00:29:39.300 --> 00:29:43.710 align:middle line:10%
have to be really careful,
because most of the time-- now,

00:29:43.710 --> 00:29:47.670 align:middle line:10%
I never been to a place that
they have not already visited.

00:29:47.670 --> 00:29:50.300 align:middle line:84%
So they've been doing
this for quite a while,

00:29:50.300 --> 00:29:52.080 align:middle line:90%
so we get to see videos.

00:29:52.080 --> 00:29:55.560 align:middle line:84%
We get to learn about
what the makeup is

00:29:55.560 --> 00:29:59.610 align:middle line:84%
of the atmosphere, what you're
supposed-- what you can touch,

00:29:59.610 --> 00:30:02.940 align:middle line:90%
what you can't touch.

00:30:02.940 --> 00:30:06.150 align:middle line:84%
It's just a basic debriefing,
and many military people here

00:30:06.150 --> 00:30:10.170 align:middle line:84%
know before you go to
another country or war,

00:30:10.170 --> 00:30:14.010 align:middle line:84%
you get a big debriefing,
OK, of everything

00:30:14.010 --> 00:30:16.110 align:middle line:84%
about the country
so you don't go

00:30:16.110 --> 00:30:19.410 align:middle line:84%
around upsetting people or
touching the wrong things.

00:30:19.410 --> 00:30:22.770 align:middle line:84%
And the same thing applies
to the underground classified

00:30:22.770 --> 00:30:24.870 align:middle line:90%
facilities.

00:30:24.870 --> 00:30:26.340 align:middle line:90%
And it is a very--

00:30:26.340 --> 00:30:30.180 align:middle line:84%
sometimes, a beautiful
environment, and sometimes it's

00:30:30.180 --> 00:30:32.370 align:middle line:90%
very scary, too.

00:30:32.370 --> 00:30:36.060 align:middle line:84%
And these robotic-- which
we're going to show.

00:30:36.060 --> 00:30:37.810 align:middle line:90%
It'll be coming up soon.

00:30:37.810 --> 00:30:43.050 align:middle line:84%
But these little robotic
devices that come with us

00:30:43.050 --> 00:30:46.680 align:middle line:84%
lock into the ground,
and sometimes it

00:30:46.680 --> 00:30:48.690 align:middle line:90%
looks like a tripod.

00:30:48.690 --> 00:30:51.960 align:middle line:84%
And it connects all of us
together through a Bluetooth

00:30:51.960 --> 00:30:55.230 align:middle line:84%
system, so we all know what
everyone's heart rate is,

00:30:55.230 --> 00:30:57.090 align:middle line:84%
we all know where
everyone's at one moment,

00:30:57.090 --> 00:31:00.660 align:middle line:90%
everyone can hear everyone.

00:31:00.660 --> 00:31:04.230 align:middle line:84%
And you have to be careful,
because some places don't

00:31:04.230 --> 00:31:06.690 align:middle line:90%
have very stable ground.

00:31:06.690 --> 00:31:10.200 align:middle line:84%
And the stratas, it might
look like it's hard as rock,

00:31:10.200 --> 00:31:12.585 align:middle line:84%
and you will walk, and
someone just is gone.

00:31:12.585 --> 00:31:14.710 align:middle line:84%
They just fall through to
the center of the planet.

00:31:14.710 --> 00:31:16.020 align:middle line:90%
They're just gone.

00:31:16.020 --> 00:31:20.610 align:middle line:84%
So these things send out a type
of ground-penetrating radar

00:31:20.610 --> 00:31:24.750 align:middle line:84%
that's very advanced to learn
where we can walk soon as we

00:31:24.750 --> 00:31:27.800 align:middle line:90%
get there in case there are--

00:31:27.800 --> 00:31:30.420 align:middle line:84%
it does an evaluation,
basically, of the area

00:31:30.420 --> 00:31:34.210 align:middle line:90%
that we're investigating.

00:31:34.210 --> 00:31:39.580 align:middle line:84%
Well, here's another one
of these modified animals

00:31:39.580 --> 00:31:43.450 align:middle line:84%
that we have actually
did hybridization

00:31:43.450 --> 00:31:45.550 align:middle line:90%
on in the projects.

00:31:45.550 --> 00:31:50.770 align:middle line:10%
Now, they did take DNA from
many types of extraterrestrials

00:31:50.770 --> 00:31:53.440 align:middle line:10%
and humans and mixed it with
pretty much every DNA you

00:31:53.440 --> 00:31:56.890 align:middle line:10%
can imagine here on the planet
and has grown something out

00:31:56.890 --> 00:31:58.040 align:middle line:10%
of it.

00:31:58.040 --> 00:32:03.070 align:middle line:10%
And this was an
interesting type of canine,

00:32:03.070 --> 00:32:09.030 align:middle line:10%
because it had this bulbous head
with a transparent membrane,

00:32:09.030 --> 00:32:13.390 align:middle line:10%
kind of like if you
guys ever look up the--

00:32:13.390 --> 00:32:14.190 align:middle line:10%
what's that called?

00:32:14.190 --> 00:32:17.720 align:middle line:10%
The bottle-- the barrel-eyed
fish down in the water.

00:32:17.720 --> 00:32:19.470 align:middle line:10%
It's called a barrel-eyed
fish, and that's

00:32:19.470 --> 00:32:20.887 align:middle line:10%
what it reminded
me of, because it

00:32:20.887 --> 00:32:24.690 align:middle line:10%
has this clear little
membrane where the eyes are,

00:32:24.690 --> 00:32:27.870 align:middle line:10%
and they can look behind
itself and in front of itself

00:32:27.870 --> 00:32:29.882 align:middle line:10%
at the same time.

00:32:29.882 --> 00:32:31.340 align:middle line:10%
Really interesting
stuff, but we're

00:32:31.340 --> 00:32:34.470 align:middle line:10%
going to get into
that a little later.

00:32:34.470 --> 00:32:36.080 align:middle line:10%
And there's also
sorts of instruments.

00:32:36.080 --> 00:32:39.390 align:middle line:10%
This is like a double
[INAUDIBLE] a little bit more

00:32:39.390 --> 00:32:45.810 align:middle line:10%
high tech, and used for healing.

00:32:45.810 --> 00:32:48.030 align:middle line:10%
There were some other--

00:32:48.030 --> 00:32:50.640 align:middle line:10%
many, many types
of archeological

00:32:50.640 --> 00:32:52.740 align:middle line:10%
finds that we find
on these craft

00:32:52.740 --> 00:32:55.640 align:middle line:10%
or near the crash site
that are pretty amazing.

00:32:55.640 --> 00:32:58.250 align:middle line:10%
Now, I was not privy to find
out too much about this,

00:32:58.250 --> 00:33:00.000 align:middle line:10%
but I do remember what
it looked like when

00:33:00.000 --> 00:33:03.260 align:middle line:10%
they picked it up and put it
into this vacuum container.

00:33:03.260 --> 00:33:05.900 align:middle line:10%


00:33:05.900 --> 00:33:12.580 align:middle line:10%
A lot of the ETs do have, of
course, that five-star being.

00:33:12.580 --> 00:33:14.570 align:middle line:84%
We have a head, two
arms, and two legs.

00:33:14.570 --> 00:33:16.800 align:middle line:90%
The majority of them have this.

00:33:16.800 --> 00:33:22.830 align:middle line:10%
And depending on where they were
made or where they came from,

00:33:22.830 --> 00:33:26.610 align:middle line:10%
they have many distinguishing
characteristics

00:33:26.610 --> 00:33:31.880 align:middle line:10%
that sets apart
for classification,

00:33:31.880 --> 00:33:35.320 align:middle line:10%
and we use that to
classify the beings.

00:33:35.320 --> 00:33:37.520 align:middle line:10%
And we're going to talk
more about that as well.

00:33:37.520 --> 00:33:38.320 align:middle line:90%
And here's one.

00:33:38.320 --> 00:33:40.450 align:middle line:84%
This is just an example
of one of the ones.

00:33:40.450 --> 00:33:42.970 align:middle line:90%


00:33:42.970 --> 00:33:47.320 align:middle line:84%
Now, have you heard about
these underground trains

00:33:47.320 --> 00:33:53.140 align:middle line:84%
and these hypersonic
vacuum tubes, and maglevs?

00:33:53.140 --> 00:33:55.570 align:middle line:84%
This was another
similar one that we've

00:33:55.570 --> 00:33:59.240 align:middle line:84%
seen under-- this is
a rendition of it.

00:33:59.240 --> 00:34:02.570 align:middle line:84%
People were not standing
around in suits, by the way.

00:34:02.570 --> 00:34:06.160 align:middle line:10%
But this is just a kind
of a rendition of that.

00:34:06.160 --> 00:34:08.880 align:middle line:90%
And it was not a turbine.

00:34:08.880 --> 00:34:11.620 align:middle line:84%
It wasn't so much
like a turbine.

00:34:11.620 --> 00:34:15.190 align:middle line:90%
It was more of a light, OK?

00:34:15.190 --> 00:34:16.840 align:middle line:90%
It ran off of light.

00:34:16.840 --> 00:34:18.280 align:middle line:84%
That's all I can
tell you, and I'm

00:34:18.280 --> 00:34:23.110 align:middle line:84%
sure there's a lot of
electromagnetic anti-gravitic

00:34:23.110 --> 00:34:25.920 align:middle line:84%
devices down there
that I'm 100% aware of.

00:34:25.920 --> 00:34:29.800 align:middle line:84%
And I was with John
Lear few months ago.

00:34:29.800 --> 00:34:34.239 align:middle line:84%
You guys maybe saw that show
on Gaia, where he had the map.

00:34:34.239 --> 00:34:35.225 align:middle line:90%
It was great.

00:34:35.225 --> 00:34:36.850 align:middle line:84%
And he's like, oh,
yeah, I have the map

00:34:36.850 --> 00:34:39.382 align:middle line:90%
of the underground maglevs.

00:34:39.382 --> 00:34:40.340 align:middle line:90%
And I was like, really?

00:34:40.340 --> 00:34:44.710 align:middle line:10%
Because the only ones I know
about are from Las Vegas,

00:34:44.710 --> 00:34:54.940 align:middle line:10%
to White Sands, to Mountain Air,
to Albuquerque, to Los Alamos,

00:34:54.940 --> 00:35:01.570 align:middle line:10%
to Dulce, to Crestone,
to Colorado Springs,

00:35:01.570 --> 00:35:06.930 align:middle line:10%
to DIA, Denver.

00:35:06.930 --> 00:35:09.160 align:middle line:84%
I like Denver
International Airport.

00:35:09.160 --> 00:35:11.440 align:middle line:84%
Now, they have
these huge pictures.

00:35:11.440 --> 00:35:12.760 align:middle line:90%
What's going on under Denver?

00:35:12.760 --> 00:35:13.560 align:middle line:90%
It's like an ET.

00:35:13.560 --> 00:35:14.680 align:middle line:90%
You know, "Ee."

00:35:14.680 --> 00:35:17.100 align:middle line:90%
And it's like, what?

00:35:17.100 --> 00:35:18.100 align:middle line:10%
Where are you going to--

00:35:18.100 --> 00:35:19.360 align:middle line:10%
you going to hide something?

00:35:19.360 --> 00:35:20.710 align:middle line:90%
Where are you going to hide it?

00:35:20.710 --> 00:35:24.790 align:middle line:84%
In plain Sight And it's funny
they're making jokes about it,

00:35:24.790 --> 00:35:27.230 align:middle line:90%
but it's real.

00:35:27.230 --> 00:35:30.280 align:middle line:10%
So anyway, going back to
Los Alamos, Dulce, Crestone,

00:35:30.280 --> 00:35:31.990 align:middle line:10%
Colorado Springs,
and Denver, that's

00:35:31.990 --> 00:35:34.750 align:middle line:10%
the only one I can
firsthand verify

00:35:34.750 --> 00:35:38.380 align:middle line:10%
that they do have these
underground maglev

00:35:38.380 --> 00:35:42.010 align:middle line:10%
trains and other different
types of ways of traveling now,

00:35:42.010 --> 00:35:45.480 align:middle line:10%
and that was a long time ago, so
I'm sure it's a lot cooler now.

00:35:45.480 --> 00:35:52.250 align:middle line:84%
800 miles an hour is the
ones that I was exposed to.

00:35:52.250 --> 00:35:54.590 align:middle line:84%
They have ones now
that I heard they

00:35:54.590 --> 00:35:58.640 align:middle line:84%
can get from here to Australia
in, I think, 20, 30 minutes.

00:35:58.640 --> 00:35:59.945 align:middle line:90%
>> Wow.

00:35:59.945 --> 00:36:03.520 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, because it goes
through the center of the Earth,

00:36:03.520 --> 00:36:07.070 align:middle line:84%
and there and there's
no heat at all.

00:36:07.070 --> 00:36:10.050 align:middle line:90%
It's a new type of technology.

00:36:10.050 --> 00:36:11.380 align:middle line:90%
Well, here's a nice character.

00:36:11.380 --> 00:36:12.840 align:middle line:10%
He's dressed very nice.

00:36:12.840 --> 00:36:13.640 align:middle line:10%
It's funny.

00:36:13.640 --> 00:36:17.780 align:middle line:10%
Sometimes when I'm explaining
to the character, when

00:36:17.780 --> 00:36:22.130 align:middle line:10%
they're doing the sketches
and I'm like, yeah, that's it.

00:36:22.130 --> 00:36:24.810 align:middle line:84%
And then they'll call me two
days later like, well, wasn't

00:36:24.810 --> 00:36:26.360 align:middle line:90%
he wearing a suit or something?

00:36:26.360 --> 00:36:27.948 align:middle line:90%
I'm like, no, he wasn't.

00:36:27.948 --> 00:36:29.240 align:middle line:90%
He was like, he didn't have it?

00:36:29.240 --> 00:36:32.240 align:middle line:84%
Well, we can't just keep showing
all these naked bodies forever.

00:36:32.240 --> 00:36:33.148 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:36:33.148 --> 00:36:34.690 align:middle line:84%
And I'm like, well,
what do you mean?

00:36:34.690 --> 00:36:37.350 align:middle line:84%
I can't lie about
it or embellish.

00:36:37.350 --> 00:36:39.220 align:middle line:84%
I mean, they don't
usually have stuff.

00:36:39.220 --> 00:36:43.010 align:middle line:84%
But there are ETs, of
course, that do have apparel,

00:36:43.010 --> 00:36:45.385 align:middle line:90%
but not this Prada zip up.

00:36:45.385 --> 00:36:47.890 align:middle line:10%
[LAUGHTER]

00:36:47.890 --> 00:36:49.250 align:middle line:10%
The Moss Man.

00:36:49.250 --> 00:36:50.960 align:middle line:10%
I get a lot of
heat for this one.

00:36:50.960 --> 00:36:55.970 align:middle line:10%
And they had a being
kept in captivity,

00:36:55.970 --> 00:37:02.060 align:middle line:10%
and this is in New Mexico as
well, that was very human-like,

00:37:02.060 --> 00:37:04.160 align:middle line:10%
and it grew moss on it.

00:37:04.160 --> 00:37:08.030 align:middle line:84%
And you couldn't
really see the face,

00:37:08.030 --> 00:37:11.690 align:middle line:84%
because I'm not even
sure if it had one.

00:37:11.690 --> 00:37:16.670 align:middle line:84%
But it was conscious,
and it was telepathic.

00:37:16.670 --> 00:37:18.260 align:middle line:90%
And they do have--

00:37:18.260 --> 00:37:20.390 align:middle line:84%
there's also a lot
of ETs that work

00:37:20.390 --> 00:37:23.780 align:middle line:84%
with us in the governments,
in the projects.

00:37:23.780 --> 00:37:27.140 align:middle line:84%
And then there's other ones
that are kept in captivity,

00:37:27.140 --> 00:37:29.840 align:middle line:90%
and I don't know why.

00:37:29.840 --> 00:37:32.720 align:middle line:84%
They might be studying
them, doing experiments.

00:37:32.720 --> 00:37:37.610 align:middle line:10%
But this is completely plant
based with human genetics.

00:37:37.610 --> 00:37:43.920 align:middle line:90%


00:37:43.920 --> 00:37:45.860 align:middle line:10%
Well, you guys know this guy.

00:37:45.860 --> 00:37:51.300 align:middle line:10%
That's the Atacama being where--

00:37:51.300 --> 00:37:52.590 align:middle line:10%
there's another.

00:37:52.590 --> 00:37:54.030 align:middle line:10%
Did a CAT scan.

00:37:54.030 --> 00:37:57.630 align:middle line:10%
I was with CSETI for many
years with my colleague.

00:37:57.630 --> 00:37:59.020 align:middle line:10%
You guys know him.

00:37:59.020 --> 00:38:02.850 align:middle line:10%
And he asked me to
come along to Barcelona

00:38:02.850 --> 00:38:07.890 align:middle line:10%
to extract some genetics
from the small being

00:38:07.890 --> 00:38:11.430 align:middle line:10%
that they found in
the Atacama Desert.

00:38:11.430 --> 00:38:17.537 align:middle line:10%
And that was kind of my thing,
so I said, sure, let's do it.

00:38:17.537 --> 00:38:19.620 align:middle line:10%
And you can see them in
"Sirius," the documentary.

00:38:19.620 --> 00:38:21.570 align:middle line:10%
But these are some
original pictures

00:38:21.570 --> 00:38:26.550 align:middle line:10%
of me collecting some bone
marrow from the rib cage.

00:38:26.550 --> 00:38:32.430 align:middle line:10%
And I also was scraping
the inside of the skull

00:38:32.430 --> 00:38:37.200 align:middle line:10%
to get some samples and smuggle
them back to the United States.

00:38:37.200 --> 00:38:40.690 align:middle line:84%
Now I know why he
asked me to do it.

00:38:40.690 --> 00:38:43.540 align:middle line:10%
He's a smart guy.

00:38:43.540 --> 00:38:45.670 align:middle line:10%
So here we are, working.

00:38:45.670 --> 00:38:51.390 align:middle line:10%
That's me and Dr. Jan
Bravo there assisting

00:38:51.390 --> 00:38:54.370 align:middle line:10%
and getting the area ready.

00:38:54.370 --> 00:38:57.960 align:middle line:10%
And here's another
reptilian, and there's

00:38:57.960 --> 00:38:59.530 align:middle line:10%
many different kinds.

00:38:59.530 --> 00:39:00.600 align:middle line:90%
There's not just one.

00:39:00.600 --> 00:39:04.890 align:middle line:84%
It's like, is there just
one of us here on Earth?

00:39:04.890 --> 00:39:07.890 align:middle line:10%
The races are so
diversified, and people

00:39:07.890 --> 00:39:12.930 align:middle line:10%
need to realize that just
like we're so diversified here

00:39:12.930 --> 00:39:16.530 align:middle line:10%
on planet Earth,
imagine what's going on

00:39:16.530 --> 00:39:18.870 align:middle line:10%
out there in the solar system.

00:39:18.870 --> 00:39:23.670 align:middle line:84%
People are intermingling,
beings are intermingling.

00:39:23.670 --> 00:39:26.870 align:middle line:84%
We're going to do a little Q&A
right at the end, but go ahead.

00:39:26.870 --> 00:39:27.850 align:middle line:90%
>> Thank you.

00:39:27.850 --> 00:39:31.280 align:middle line:90%


00:39:31.280 --> 00:39:33.230 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, that's
a great question.

00:39:33.230 --> 00:39:37.120 align:middle line:84%
She said, "How do they
reproduce to make that diverse?"

00:39:37.120 --> 00:39:40.510 align:middle line:84%
well, they all, most
all of these beings

00:39:40.510 --> 00:39:46.750 align:middle line:84%
that I was involved with,
have reproductive systems,

00:39:46.750 --> 00:39:50.350 align:middle line:84%
and they can do it
just like we do it, OK?

00:39:50.350 --> 00:39:51.880 align:middle line:90%
They do have sexual organs.

00:39:51.880 --> 00:39:54.520 align:middle line:84%
Some are inside the
body though, that you

00:39:54.520 --> 00:39:56.740 align:middle line:90%
don't see, like this one.

00:39:56.740 --> 00:40:00.755 align:middle line:84%
But there are orifices
in these bodies.

00:40:00.755 --> 00:40:03.130 align:middle line:84%
I think there's going to be
some other pictures coming up

00:40:03.130 --> 00:40:06.780 align:middle line:84%
that-- we'll show that, where
their appendages will come out

00:40:06.780 --> 00:40:08.980 align:middle line:90%
or sexual organs will come out.

00:40:08.980 --> 00:40:11.290 align:middle line:84%
And then there's other
ways they can do it

00:40:11.290 --> 00:40:17.960 align:middle line:84%
through chemicals
through their skin,

00:40:17.960 --> 00:40:19.910 align:middle line:90%
so it's pretty fascinating.

00:40:19.910 --> 00:40:24.680 align:middle line:84%
One of the most
fascinating ETs I saw was--

00:40:24.680 --> 00:40:30.590 align:middle line:84%
she had a four-quadrant uterus,
and they only give birth once

00:40:30.590 --> 00:40:32.450 align:middle line:84%
in their lifetime,
four children.

00:40:32.450 --> 00:40:36.380 align:middle line:90%


00:40:36.380 --> 00:40:38.070 align:middle line:90%
Amazing.

00:40:38.070 --> 00:40:40.840 align:middle line:84%
And we had a craft
that went down,

00:40:40.840 --> 00:40:43.320 align:middle line:84%
and there was multiple
of these beings in there,

00:40:43.320 --> 00:40:45.390 align:middle line:84%
and some of them
actually had beings

00:40:45.390 --> 00:40:49.695 align:middle line:84%
gestating in the quadrant,
four quadrants of the uterus.

00:40:49.695 --> 00:40:56.190 align:middle line:90%


00:40:56.190 --> 00:40:56.990 align:middle line:90%
Live action.

00:40:56.990 --> 00:40:57.310 align:middle line:90%
Look at this.

00:40:57.310 --> 00:40:58.110 align:middle line:90%
Whoa.

00:40:58.110 --> 00:40:59.770 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:40:59.770 --> 00:41:02.610 align:middle line:90%
Hey, guy.

00:41:02.610 --> 00:41:03.610 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:41:03.610 --> 00:41:04.450 align:middle line:90%
They do great.

00:41:04.450 --> 00:41:05.100 align:middle line:90%
I like their artwork.

00:41:05.100 --> 00:41:05.900 align:middle line:90%
It's cool.

00:41:05.900 --> 00:41:08.260 align:middle line:90%


00:41:08.260 --> 00:41:09.705 align:middle line:84%
Oh, here's a craft
that went down.

00:41:09.705 --> 00:41:12.210 align:middle line:90%


00:41:12.210 --> 00:41:13.210 align:middle line:10%
And you're going to see.

00:41:13.210 --> 00:41:14.880 align:middle line:10%
I have another
picture of this craft.

00:41:14.880 --> 00:41:18.690 align:middle line:10%
But what's interesting
with this being is

00:41:18.690 --> 00:41:22.810 align:middle line:10%
it was breathing from a slit
right where your sternum is,

00:41:22.810 --> 00:41:23.610 align:middle line:10%
OK?

00:41:23.610 --> 00:41:25.590 align:middle line:10%
Right where-- not
the sternal notch.

00:41:25.590 --> 00:41:28.710 align:middle line:10%
Go all the way down here,
right to the bottom.

00:41:28.710 --> 00:41:33.630 align:middle line:84%
And it had this huge opening,
and this human type being

00:41:33.630 --> 00:41:39.960 align:middle line:84%
was actually breathing our
oxygen. And they were--

00:41:39.960 --> 00:41:43.230 align:middle line:84%
the medics there were
applying different things now.

00:41:43.230 --> 00:41:45.810 align:middle line:84%
So we don't go and bag and tag
them, and kill them, right?

00:41:45.810 --> 00:41:47.920 align:middle line:84%
Now, everything is
a good cleanup crew.

00:41:47.920 --> 00:41:51.020 align:middle line:84%
They go there, cover
up everything first,

00:41:51.020 --> 00:41:52.830 align:middle line:84%
try to do everything
they possibly

00:41:52.830 --> 00:41:59.220 align:middle line:84%
can to save the creatures by
examining what their craft

00:41:59.220 --> 00:42:01.805 align:middle line:84%
and what their atmospheric
conditions are.

00:42:01.805 --> 00:42:03.180 align:middle line:84%
And that's the
first thing to do,

00:42:03.180 --> 00:42:08.080 align:middle line:84%
is, of course, keep them alive
just like we do here, our ABCs.

00:42:08.080 --> 00:42:11.970 align:middle line:84%
And they were actually
applying oxygen

00:42:11.970 --> 00:42:17.610 align:middle line:84%
to this being when we got there
already through this orifice.

00:42:17.610 --> 00:42:19.380 align:middle line:84%
And it was really
interesting to see this.

00:42:19.380 --> 00:42:22.640 align:middle line:84%
Now, they did have a mouth, by
the way, but it wasn't used.

00:42:22.640 --> 00:42:25.920 align:middle line:84%
They weren't
breathing through it.

00:42:25.920 --> 00:42:32.570 align:middle line:10%
Now, in the oceans, they're
full of lots of bases

00:42:32.570 --> 00:42:36.230 align:middle line:10%
all over the planet, and
they're monitored by us.

00:42:36.230 --> 00:42:39.660 align:middle line:84%
Your governments know
about this, most of them.

00:42:39.660 --> 00:42:43.027 align:middle line:10%
And there's actually different--
and we have space forces,

00:42:43.027 --> 00:42:44.360 align:middle line:10%
and of course, we have the Navy.

00:42:44.360 --> 00:42:48.740 align:middle line:84%
But there's actually a special
different type of Naval force

00:42:48.740 --> 00:42:52.190 align:middle line:84%
that's down there, and we
build bases next to their bases

00:42:52.190 --> 00:42:56.220 align:middle line:84%
and next to their portals
and monitor the activity.

00:42:56.220 --> 00:42:58.790 align:middle line:84%
Now, to my knowledge,
there has never

00:42:58.790 --> 00:43:02.300 align:middle line:84%
been an incident
of negativity with

00:43:02.300 --> 00:43:06.480 align:middle line:84%
their underground facilities
and under base facilities.

00:43:06.480 --> 00:43:09.800 align:middle line:10%
Now, we have our own
underwater facilities, too.

00:43:09.800 --> 00:43:12.350 align:middle line:10%
And the way we make them
is, we actually tunnel

00:43:12.350 --> 00:43:16.910 align:middle line:10%
from mainland down into,
and under, through the rock,

00:43:16.910 --> 00:43:20.150 align:middle line:10%
in the oceans, and
build from the ocean up.

00:43:20.150 --> 00:43:23.390 align:middle line:10%
So we don't go out there with a
two-by-fours, and steel beams,

00:43:23.390 --> 00:43:26.270 align:middle line:10%
and drop them off in the
water, and go on there, welding

00:43:26.270 --> 00:43:27.590 align:middle line:10%
like they do with the oil rigs.

00:43:27.590 --> 00:43:29.090 align:middle line:10%
No, no, no.

00:43:29.090 --> 00:43:32.930 align:middle line:10%
We have much better
technology to melt the rock

00:43:32.930 --> 00:43:35.030 align:middle line:10%
with these
thermonuclear reactors

00:43:35.030 --> 00:43:41.390 align:middle line:10%
and get up, and then build
from under the sea floor up.

00:43:41.390 --> 00:43:45.590 align:middle line:84%
And they have these special,
amazing electromagnetic energy

00:43:45.590 --> 00:43:51.990 align:middle line:84%
devices that can move trillions
of tons of water out of the way

00:43:51.990 --> 00:43:55.100 align:middle line:90%
and prepare an area.

00:43:55.100 --> 00:43:57.260 align:middle line:84%
And sometimes,
what they do too is

00:43:57.260 --> 00:44:00.650 align:middle line:84%
they will build it right
below the sea floor,

00:44:00.650 --> 00:44:06.090 align:middle line:84%
and then dig the
seafloor out around it,

00:44:06.090 --> 00:44:08.480 align:middle line:90%
so it's already enclosed.

00:44:08.480 --> 00:44:11.090 align:middle line:84%
And the only way you can
get to these deep places

00:44:11.090 --> 00:44:17.300 align:middle line:84%
are through these maglev tube
trains and underground tunnels

00:44:17.300 --> 00:44:19.457 align:middle line:90%
that they have man made.

00:44:19.457 --> 00:44:20.540 align:middle line:90%
And some are not man made.

00:44:20.540 --> 00:44:21.748 align:middle line:90%
Some have been there forever.

00:44:21.748 --> 00:44:26.250 align:middle line:90%


00:44:26.250 --> 00:44:31.950 align:middle line:10%
Now, there are some beings, and
some call them the Aquafarians.

00:44:31.950 --> 00:44:36.270 align:middle line:10%
Pop culture term, but
it has been used before.

00:44:36.270 --> 00:44:42.360 align:middle line:10%
And when you're trying to heal
and help extraterrestrials,

00:44:42.360 --> 00:44:45.300 align:middle line:10%
the environment is
really important,

00:44:45.300 --> 00:44:49.702 align:middle line:10%
because if you just put me in
a room full of carbon dioxide

00:44:49.702 --> 00:44:51.660 align:middle line:10%
and you're trying to save
me, it's probably not

00:44:51.660 --> 00:44:54.500 align:middle line:10%
going to work so well for me.

00:44:54.500 --> 00:44:55.500 align:middle line:90%
Just ask David Weathers.

00:44:55.500 --> 00:44:58.200 align:middle line:90%


00:44:58.200 --> 00:45:05.160 align:middle line:10%
But this aqua being was a
water being that we got in.

00:45:05.160 --> 00:45:09.870 align:middle line:84%
And we have these special rooms
that are actually full of water

00:45:09.870 --> 00:45:12.470 align:middle line:84%
and pressurized at
certain pressures

00:45:12.470 --> 00:45:16.770 align:middle line:84%
to simulate so the
being can stay alive.

00:45:16.770 --> 00:45:19.680 align:middle line:84%
And then we can try to
help get them better,

00:45:19.680 --> 00:45:25.620 align:middle line:84%
and fix whatever the injury
is, or just to study the being.

00:45:25.620 --> 00:45:29.670 align:middle line:84%
And we have huge vats that
we keep the beings in,

00:45:29.670 --> 00:45:31.470 align:middle line:84%
the ones who have passed
away, and they all

00:45:31.470 --> 00:45:34.650 align:middle line:84%
have their own atmospheric
conditions in these giant vats.

00:45:34.650 --> 00:45:37.560 align:middle line:84%
I think I do have a
picture of that as well.

00:45:37.560 --> 00:45:41.555 align:middle line:10%
So what you're seeing is an
underwater operating room,

00:45:41.555 --> 00:45:43.055 align:middle line:10%
is what you're
looking at right now.

00:45:43.055 --> 00:45:45.790 align:middle line:90%


00:45:45.790 --> 00:45:50.200 align:middle line:84%
We treat even our above ground
operating rooms the same way.

00:45:50.200 --> 00:45:53.500 align:middle line:84%
They're all pressurized,
multiple-pressure doors

00:45:53.500 --> 00:45:55.000 align:middle line:90%
before you get in there.

00:45:55.000 --> 00:45:57.280 align:middle line:84%
And you have your own
little kind of space suit

00:45:57.280 --> 00:46:01.420 align:middle line:84%
that you're completely
confined to,

00:46:01.420 --> 00:46:05.830 align:middle line:84%
and it basically protects
you from any contaminants.

00:46:05.830 --> 00:46:09.400 align:middle line:84%
And it also protects
the patient or the ET

00:46:09.400 --> 00:46:10.750 align:middle line:90%
from us contaminating it.

00:46:10.750 --> 00:46:12.565 align:middle line:84%
A long time ago,
they had problems.

00:46:12.565 --> 00:46:15.130 align:middle line:90%


00:46:15.130 --> 00:46:18.100 align:middle line:84%
What they would do is, they
would find a crash site,

00:46:18.100 --> 00:46:21.580 align:middle line:84%
grab these ETs that were
dead, and throw them

00:46:21.580 --> 00:46:24.878 align:middle line:84%
in a big 55 gallon
drum of formaldehyde,

00:46:24.878 --> 00:46:25.920 align:middle line:90%
or alcohol, or something.

00:46:25.920 --> 00:46:28.003 align:middle line:84%
Then ship them to Nellis,
and then they get there,

00:46:28.003 --> 00:46:31.460 align:middle line:84%
and they open it up,
and it's just all Jell-O

00:46:31.460 --> 00:46:36.515 align:middle line:84%
because it's not the best
thing to store bodies

00:46:36.515 --> 00:46:39.063 align:middle line:84%
in on different
extraterrestrials

00:46:39.063 --> 00:46:39.980 align:middle line:90%
from different places.

00:46:39.980 --> 00:46:42.390 align:middle line:84%
You can't just dump them
in certain chemicals.

00:46:42.390 --> 00:46:44.240 align:middle line:90%
So learned the hard way.

00:46:44.240 --> 00:46:47.180 align:middle line:84%
And then they found out
that some extraterrestrials

00:46:47.180 --> 00:46:53.510 align:middle line:84%
have a defense system in their
bloodstream and in their DNA,

00:46:53.510 --> 00:46:58.440 align:middle line:84%
that if you're not on the
same frequency, that you

00:46:58.440 --> 00:47:00.570 align:middle line:90%
will destroy the sample.

00:47:00.570 --> 00:47:02.880 align:middle line:84%
So back in the day,
they would-- and I've

00:47:02.880 --> 00:47:08.790 align:middle line:84%
seen a lot of old videos of
scientists and technicians

00:47:08.790 --> 00:47:12.840 align:middle line:84%
like myself 20, 30 years
before I even came along,

00:47:12.840 --> 00:47:16.860 align:middle line:84%
that they showed us that they
would take samples, put them

00:47:16.860 --> 00:47:21.720 align:middle line:84%
in vacutainers, put them
inside these special containers

00:47:21.720 --> 00:47:22.853 align:middle line:90%
in the walls.

00:47:22.853 --> 00:47:24.270 align:middle line:84%
And they'd come
back the next day,

00:47:24.270 --> 00:47:26.730 align:middle line:90%
and it would be at all liquid.

00:47:26.730 --> 00:47:27.720 align:middle line:90%
And they didn't under--

00:47:27.720 --> 00:47:29.820 align:middle line:84%
it took them a long
time to figure out

00:47:29.820 --> 00:47:33.060 align:middle line:84%
that it had to do with
frequencies of the being.

00:47:33.060 --> 00:47:35.100 align:middle line:84%
So if you were not
the same frequency,

00:47:35.100 --> 00:47:37.950 align:middle line:84%
it was like a
self-destruct mechanism,

00:47:37.950 --> 00:47:43.470 align:middle line:84%
and it would destroy the genetic
code and DNA of that being.

00:47:43.470 --> 00:47:46.470 align:middle line:84%
So they came out with
this idea of inoculating

00:47:46.470 --> 00:47:52.830 align:middle line:84%
the people with the same
frequency and the same DNA.

00:47:52.830 --> 00:47:55.680 align:middle line:84%
So a lot of the
clinicians, including

00:47:55.680 --> 00:48:00.060 align:middle line:84%
myself and many
other doctors, were

00:48:00.060 --> 00:48:02.640 align:middle line:84%
inoculated with certain things
that would last anywhere

00:48:02.640 --> 00:48:04.800 align:middle line:90%
from a day to five days.

00:48:04.800 --> 00:48:07.410 align:middle line:84%
And it allowed you
to be near this being

00:48:07.410 --> 00:48:11.590 align:middle line:84%
and operate on it without
destroying the being.

00:48:11.590 --> 00:48:16.060 align:middle line:84%
What's really sad though, is
that a lot of these beings

00:48:16.060 --> 00:48:21.010 align:middle line:84%
actually could have been saved
if they were back on their ship

00:48:21.010 --> 00:48:23.770 align:middle line:90%
or back on their home planet.

00:48:23.770 --> 00:48:29.260 align:middle line:84%
And they have a resonance that
the beings travel with such

00:48:29.260 --> 00:48:34.440 align:middle line:84%
as, maybe a part of their
planet is made in the craft,

00:48:34.440 --> 00:48:35.920 align:middle line:90%
and it helps keep them alive.

00:48:35.920 --> 00:48:37.930 align:middle line:84%
We notice sometimes,
the further we

00:48:37.930 --> 00:48:40.990 align:middle line:84%
take the being away from the
craft, the further the being

00:48:40.990 --> 00:48:44.840 align:middle line:84%
deteriorates and goes
into cardiac arrest.

00:48:44.840 --> 00:48:47.135 align:middle line:84%
So we know that the ship
has something to do with it.

00:48:47.135 --> 00:48:49.405 align:middle line:84%
There's this connection
with the craft.

00:48:49.405 --> 00:48:52.980 align:middle line:90%


00:48:52.980 --> 00:48:55.710 align:middle line:90%
Doggy time.

00:48:55.710 --> 00:48:59.488 align:middle line:10%
So this is in New Mexico.

00:48:59.488 --> 00:49:01.530 align:middle line:84%
We're going to-- there's
another picture of this.

00:49:01.530 --> 00:49:03.220 align:middle line:90%
We're going to jump around.

00:49:03.220 --> 00:49:07.800 align:middle line:10%
And it looks like a picture
frame, a giant black picture

00:49:07.800 --> 00:49:09.960 align:middle line:10%
frame that you're
walking through.

00:49:09.960 --> 00:49:12.900 align:middle line:90%
And it's kind of just blurry.

00:49:12.900 --> 00:49:15.510 align:middle line:10%
It's not like this big thing
like you see in the movies

00:49:15.510 --> 00:49:17.850 align:middle line:10%
where you're going
through stars,

00:49:17.850 --> 00:49:20.760 align:middle line:10%
and it's not like in
"Contact" where you

00:49:20.760 --> 00:49:22.310 align:middle line:10%
have all this amazing light.

00:49:22.310 --> 00:49:26.160 align:middle line:10%
And it's basically just a
small blur as you walk through.

00:49:26.160 --> 00:49:28.260 align:middle line:10%
And what I've noticed
is this giant--

00:49:28.260 --> 00:49:29.760 align:middle line:10%
usually a pressure
change, kind of

00:49:29.760 --> 00:49:32.940 align:middle line:10%
like when you're on the
plane or scuba diving.

00:49:32.940 --> 00:49:35.190 align:middle line:84%
There's usually always a
pressure change of some sort.

00:49:35.190 --> 00:49:39.240 align:middle line:90%


00:49:39.240 --> 00:49:42.630 align:middle line:10%
Here's the suits
that we talked about.

00:49:42.630 --> 00:49:44.490 align:middle line:10%
They also have
exoskeletons, and they

00:49:44.490 --> 00:49:48.060 align:middle line:10%
do bring these special bred
canines that are hybrid canines

00:49:48.060 --> 00:49:50.010 align:middle line:10%
that they make in the projects.

00:49:50.010 --> 00:49:51.540 align:middle line:10%
The canines are
really important.

00:49:51.540 --> 00:49:56.170 align:middle line:10%
They're there for safety and to
help in case something happens.

00:49:56.170 --> 00:49:59.880 align:middle line:10%
And I'm going to show you
a video rendition of one

00:49:59.880 --> 00:50:04.020 align:middle line:10%
of the accidents that did
happen on one of the missions.

00:50:04.020 --> 00:50:09.120 align:middle line:10%
And they also have advanced
hearing and advanced senses

00:50:09.120 --> 00:50:12.030 align:middle line:10%
that we do not have, just
like our, of course, dogs

00:50:12.030 --> 00:50:15.450 align:middle line:10%
do today, but times
100 in the projects.

00:50:15.450 --> 00:50:20.190 align:middle line:10%
They're made to smell
certain toxins on your body,

00:50:20.190 --> 00:50:22.650 align:middle line:10%
certain viruses you
may be carrying,

00:50:22.650 --> 00:50:25.650 align:middle line:10%
something you may
have brought back.

00:50:25.650 --> 00:50:29.820 align:middle line:84%
These dogs are very strong
with their exoskeleton suits.

00:50:29.820 --> 00:50:31.980 align:middle line:84%
They could carry
two or three people

00:50:31.980 --> 00:50:34.170 align:middle line:84%
and drag them back through
the portal, if necessary,

00:50:34.170 --> 00:50:35.220 align:middle line:90%
if they were unconscious.

00:50:35.220 --> 00:50:37.840 align:middle line:90%


00:50:37.840 --> 00:50:39.950 align:middle line:90%
It's just a super dog.

00:50:39.950 --> 00:50:43.240 align:middle line:90%


00:50:43.240 --> 00:50:46.090 align:middle line:90%
It's a great pic.

00:50:46.090 --> 00:50:47.820 align:middle line:90%
Oh, there they go again.

00:50:47.820 --> 00:50:53.620 align:middle line:84%
Oh, here's-- these are these
types of robotic devices that

00:50:53.620 --> 00:50:54.420 align:middle line:90%
come.

00:50:54.420 --> 00:50:56.003 align:middle line:84%
Oh, and here's the
little portal here.

00:50:56.003 --> 00:50:57.070 align:middle line:90%
You see a little thing.

00:50:57.070 --> 00:50:58.620 align:middle line:90%
And it's very large, too.

00:50:58.620 --> 00:51:01.080 align:middle line:84%
So there's many times
where we'd come somewhere,

00:51:01.080 --> 00:51:06.960 align:middle line:84%
and it's just so surreal,
because you're used to the sky

00:51:06.960 --> 00:51:08.640 align:middle line:90%
being a certain color.

00:51:08.640 --> 00:51:10.650 align:middle line:84%
And one time I went
through, and the sky

00:51:10.650 --> 00:51:12.890 align:middle line:90%
was just a giant rainbow.

00:51:12.890 --> 00:51:14.640 align:middle line:84%
It was just-- the whole
sky was a rainbow.

00:51:14.640 --> 00:51:15.540 align:middle line:90%
It wasn't just all blue.

00:51:15.540 --> 00:51:16.755 align:middle line:90%
It was a beautiful rainbow.

00:51:16.755 --> 00:51:19.830 align:middle line:90%


00:51:19.830 --> 00:51:24.480 align:middle line:84%
And these devices
scan the entire area

00:51:24.480 --> 00:51:28.890 align:middle line:84%
before we start hiking
around, moving around

00:51:28.890 --> 00:51:32.340 align:middle line:84%
to let us know if there's
any other life forms there as

00:51:32.340 --> 00:51:37.440 align:middle line:84%
well, because we'd like to
know usually, what's going on.

00:51:37.440 --> 00:51:39.365 align:middle line:84%
But like I said, the
missions I've been on

00:51:39.365 --> 00:51:41.740 align:middle line:84%
were-- people have already
been on them many, many times.

00:51:41.740 --> 00:51:44.310 align:middle line:84%
So we were just going
back to these areas.

00:51:44.310 --> 00:51:48.100 align:middle line:90%


00:51:48.100 --> 00:51:52.560 align:middle line:10%
And here is the little
robot guy again.

00:51:52.560 --> 00:51:57.490 align:middle line:10%
They set up these dishes, these
little radars and antennas,

00:51:57.490 --> 00:52:00.480 align:middle line:10%
which may connect to
satellites they have already

00:52:00.480 --> 00:52:04.620 align:middle line:10%
put into wherever we're at,
and connect to the ground,

00:52:04.620 --> 00:52:07.260 align:middle line:10%
and it builds a virtual
map immediately,

00:52:07.260 --> 00:52:09.630 align:middle line:10%
and that's in your
heads-up display.

00:52:09.630 --> 00:52:13.290 align:middle line:84%
And so you know exactly
where you are on the planet,

00:52:13.290 --> 00:52:16.110 align:middle line:90%
you know how deep the strata is.

00:52:16.110 --> 00:52:18.570 align:middle line:84%
You know if it's
volcanic, if there's

00:52:18.570 --> 00:52:21.420 align:middle line:90%
going to be a volcanic event.

00:52:21.420 --> 00:52:23.430 align:middle line:84%
The animals, the
canines, are also

00:52:23.430 --> 00:52:25.830 align:middle line:90%
trained to pick up tremors.

00:52:25.830 --> 00:52:29.070 align:middle line:84%
And many-- there's
been a few times

00:52:29.070 --> 00:52:32.370 align:middle line:84%
that I've seen videos of
missions gone horribly

00:52:32.370 --> 00:52:34.980 align:middle line:84%
wrong because of an earthquake
that they just could not

00:52:34.980 --> 00:52:36.870 align:middle line:90%
prepare for.

00:52:36.870 --> 00:52:40.290 align:middle line:84%
So when you go
through a portal too,

00:52:40.290 --> 00:52:44.700 align:middle line:84%
it has to be the right
time, and the right

00:52:44.700 --> 00:52:47.370 align:middle line:90%
alignment with the stars.

00:52:47.370 --> 00:52:49.350 align:middle line:84%
It's not something-- oh,
we have a portal here.

00:52:49.350 --> 00:52:51.750 align:middle line:84%
We go in now all day
long, whenever we want.

00:52:51.750 --> 00:52:54.120 align:middle line:84%
They haven't perfected
it yet that way.

00:52:54.120 --> 00:52:59.550 align:middle line:84%
And we know recently,
because I was contacted

00:52:59.550 --> 00:53:01.980 align:middle line:84%
to go back, which I
was very surprised,

00:53:01.980 --> 00:53:03.660 align:middle line:90%
because I've come forward now.

00:53:03.660 --> 00:53:07.110 align:middle line:84%
And it's because
they have lost--

00:53:07.110 --> 00:53:08.250 align:middle line:90%
they had lost a team.

00:53:08.250 --> 00:53:10.860 align:middle line:90%


00:53:10.860 --> 00:53:12.060 align:middle line:90%
Bizarre landscapes.

00:53:12.060 --> 00:53:14.610 align:middle line:84%
There's been a few times
where I could not--

00:53:14.610 --> 00:53:17.220 align:middle line:84%
the sky looked too
close, so I think

00:53:17.220 --> 00:53:20.160 align:middle line:84%
it was more like we were in a
cave that was bioluminescent.

00:53:20.160 --> 00:53:23.220 align:middle line:90%


00:53:23.220 --> 00:53:27.210 align:middle line:90%
These come in on our VTOLs.

00:53:27.210 --> 00:53:28.890 align:middle line:90%
You guys know VTOLs are?

00:53:28.890 --> 00:53:29.690 align:middle line:90%
The Ospreys.

00:53:29.690 --> 00:53:32.107 align:middle line:10%
They're these planes that have
these giant rotors on them.

00:53:32.107 --> 00:53:33.000 align:middle line:10%
They can take up--

00:53:33.000 --> 00:53:38.590 align:middle line:10%
they can take our Marines and
Army guys up and shoot off.

00:53:38.590 --> 00:53:42.040 align:middle line:10%
This is inside one
of these VTOLs.

00:53:42.040 --> 00:53:45.340 align:middle line:10%
So these containment units
are flown in immediately

00:53:45.340 --> 00:53:48.910 align:middle line:10%
to the crash site, and we
put the beings in them,

00:53:48.910 --> 00:53:49.930 align:middle line:10%
and they're monitored.

00:53:49.930 --> 00:53:51.513 align:middle line:84%
Everything is
monitored, their health,

00:53:51.513 --> 00:53:54.230 align:middle line:90%
if they are still alive.

00:53:54.230 --> 00:53:55.900 align:middle line:84%
They have special
technology where

00:53:55.900 --> 00:53:59.380 align:middle line:84%
we can check their DNA and
their cellular activity

00:53:59.380 --> 00:54:02.170 align:middle line:84%
to see what kind of
atmosphere they came from,

00:54:02.170 --> 00:54:04.580 align:middle line:84%
so we can get the right
amount, mix of oxygen,

00:54:04.580 --> 00:54:08.530 align:middle line:84%
nitrogen, hydrogen, whatever
they need to survive in,

00:54:08.530 --> 00:54:12.580 align:middle line:84%
and to also keep the body
from deteriorating so we

00:54:12.580 --> 00:54:16.245 align:middle line:90%
can learn more about them.

00:54:16.245 --> 00:54:18.400 align:middle line:84%
But it's really
interesting, because you

00:54:18.400 --> 00:54:22.300 align:middle line:84%
might have 10 of these
VTOL aircraft come

00:54:22.300 --> 00:54:27.250 align:middle line:84%
in with these
giant vats in them,

00:54:27.250 --> 00:54:31.090 align:middle line:84%
depending on how many specimens
are at the crash site.

00:54:31.090 --> 00:54:35.420 align:middle line:90%


00:54:35.420 --> 00:54:39.110 align:middle line:84%
These are a type of
operating room table

00:54:39.110 --> 00:54:40.910 align:middle line:90%
we use in the projects.

00:54:40.910 --> 00:54:45.880 align:middle line:90%


00:54:45.880 --> 00:54:51.310 align:middle line:90%
They assist the clinician.

00:54:51.310 --> 00:54:55.000 align:middle line:84%
These tentacles come down,
and they can change shape.

00:54:55.000 --> 00:54:57.520 align:middle line:84%
They can hold instruments,
they can pick up instruments.

00:54:57.520 --> 00:55:01.760 align:middle line:84%
It's completely
artificial intelligence.

00:55:01.760 --> 00:55:07.080 align:middle line:84%
So it knows that
you need a scalpel.

00:55:07.080 --> 00:55:09.290 align:middle line:84%
It knows if
something is bleeding

00:55:09.290 --> 00:55:12.410 align:middle line:90%
that needs to be cauterized.

00:55:12.410 --> 00:55:16.760 align:middle line:84%
It's programmed through
an artificial intelligence

00:55:16.760 --> 00:55:22.250 align:middle line:84%
that they designed that will
make it out to the public

00:55:22.250 --> 00:55:23.300 align:middle line:90%
very soon.

00:55:23.300 --> 00:55:24.950 align:middle line:90%
You'll see this.

00:55:24.950 --> 00:55:30.590 align:middle line:84%
A good example of this
is the robotic da Vinci.

00:55:30.590 --> 00:55:32.510 align:middle line:84%
You guys know what
that is, the da Vinci?

00:55:32.510 --> 00:55:33.310 align:middle line:90%
It's a robot.

00:55:33.310 --> 00:55:36.080 align:middle line:90%


00:55:36.080 --> 00:55:38.240 align:middle line:84%
I was helping design some
instruments for them.

00:55:38.240 --> 00:55:43.220 align:middle line:84%
So the doctor can be in Dubai
and operating on you in Miami

00:55:43.220 --> 00:55:44.420 align:middle line:90%
with this giant robot.

00:55:44.420 --> 00:55:50.870 align:middle line:84%
So that's like, for me, looking
at that big, clunky, giant

00:55:50.870 --> 00:55:54.920 align:middle line:84%
device that weighs a ton, and
then seeing these things come

00:55:54.920 --> 00:55:58.400 align:middle line:84%
out of the ceiling to assist
you, and lift the body up,

00:55:58.400 --> 00:56:01.090 align:middle line:84%
provide traction so you
can see what you're doing.

00:56:01.090 --> 00:56:03.900 align:middle line:90%


00:56:03.900 --> 00:56:05.360 align:middle line:90%
Cool stuff, huh?

00:56:05.360 --> 00:56:06.360 align:middle line:90%
Are you guys still here?

00:56:06.360 --> 00:56:07.920 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:56:07.920 --> 00:56:09.060 align:middle line:90%
>> All right.

00:56:09.060 --> 00:56:09.860 align:middle line:90%
There we go.

00:56:09.860 --> 00:56:10.560 align:middle line:90%
We got a--

00:56:10.560 --> 00:56:11.360 align:middle line:90%
I gotta jump.

00:56:11.360 --> 00:56:13.990 align:middle line:90%
I thought I had 2 and 1/2 hours.

00:56:13.990 --> 00:56:15.930 align:middle line:84%
Now, I showed this,
just because I

00:56:15.930 --> 00:56:18.510 align:middle line:84%
want to know if any of you guys
ever seen a craft like this.

00:56:18.510 --> 00:56:20.460 align:middle line:90%
This is a crash site.

00:56:20.460 --> 00:56:22.770 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to jump through
it, and there are some bodies

00:56:22.770 --> 00:56:24.270 align:middle line:90%
there.

00:56:24.270 --> 00:56:26.910 align:middle line:84%
I want you to stop
thinking of Hollywood

00:56:26.910 --> 00:56:29.880 align:middle line:84%
craft the way you guys hear
about it or even in the Air

00:56:29.880 --> 00:56:32.400 align:middle line:90%
Force craft like the triangles.

00:56:32.400 --> 00:56:34.980 align:middle line:84%
Step out of that comfort
level, and open your eyes

00:56:34.980 --> 00:56:37.800 align:middle line:84%
up to seeing things that
just doesn't make sense,

00:56:37.800 --> 00:56:45.960 align:middle line:84%
because aerodynamics do not
fit in play with spacecraft.

00:56:45.960 --> 00:56:48.090 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't matter what
it is, because it's

00:56:48.090 --> 00:56:51.690 align:middle line:84%
using its own electromagnetic
field around it.

00:56:51.690 --> 00:56:56.860 align:middle line:90%


00:56:56.860 --> 00:56:57.660 align:middle line:90%
Oh.

00:56:57.660 --> 00:57:01.500 align:middle line:90%
Well, because I'll tell you why.

00:57:01.500 --> 00:57:04.170 align:middle line:84%
When you come into
our dimension,

00:57:04.170 --> 00:57:08.100 align:middle line:84%
you fall under our
dimensional rules.

00:57:08.100 --> 00:57:11.590 align:middle line:90%
Now, you can be killed and shot.

00:57:11.590 --> 00:57:17.320 align:middle line:84%
Not everyone is-- not all ETs
are in a superhero fashion that

00:57:17.320 --> 00:57:19.690 align:middle line:90%
are bullet proof.

00:57:19.690 --> 00:57:22.090 align:middle line:84%
They still fall
under these laws.

00:57:22.090 --> 00:57:25.120 align:middle line:84%
So an interdimensional
angel being that comes over

00:57:25.120 --> 00:57:29.623 align:middle line:84%
here has to take the
form of one of you guys,

00:57:29.623 --> 00:57:31.665 align:middle line:84%
and you can trip on the
stairs and hurt yourself.

00:57:31.665 --> 00:57:35.790 align:middle line:90%


00:57:35.790 --> 00:57:38.180 align:middle line:90%
OK, there is another Aquafarian.

00:57:38.180 --> 00:57:39.290 align:middle line:90%
Look at that guy.

00:57:39.290 --> 00:57:40.450 align:middle line:90%
Whoa.

00:57:40.450 --> 00:57:42.688 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to cruise
through these.

00:57:42.688 --> 00:57:43.730 align:middle line:90%
And then there's another.

00:57:43.730 --> 00:57:48.920 align:middle line:84%
Oh, this is a portal that's
in the Atlantic Ocean

00:57:48.920 --> 00:57:52.190 align:middle line:84%
that they've been monitoring
for quite some time,

00:57:52.190 --> 00:57:54.290 align:middle line:84%
and that's our base,
and we're watching it.

00:57:54.290 --> 00:57:59.570 align:middle line:84%
And there's craft coming in
and out of that every hour,

00:57:59.570 --> 00:58:03.590 align:middle line:90%
and they don't know what to do.

00:58:03.590 --> 00:58:06.980 align:middle line:10%
So they're just
sitting there watching.

00:58:06.980 --> 00:58:09.710 align:middle line:10%
Oh my goodness, I would
just swim up there,

00:58:09.710 --> 00:58:12.080 align:middle line:10%
and be like hey, guys.

00:58:12.080 --> 00:58:13.910 align:middle line:90%
Look at that.

00:58:13.910 --> 00:58:17.150 align:middle line:90%
Whoa, coming in hot.

00:58:17.150 --> 00:58:17.990 align:middle line:90%
I mean cold.

00:58:17.990 --> 00:58:19.726 align:middle line:90%
It's probably cold down there.

00:58:19.726 --> 00:58:21.662 align:middle line:90%
>> Bermuda Triangle.

00:58:21.662 --> 00:58:23.870 align:middle line:84%
>> It is a little bit further
out than that, but yes,

00:58:23.870 --> 00:58:25.712 align:middle line:90%
there's another guy.

00:58:25.712 --> 00:58:27.840 align:middle line:90%
Oh, this.

00:58:27.840 --> 00:58:32.860 align:middle line:84%
Here's some craft, very
seamless that we've worked on.

00:58:32.860 --> 00:58:36.340 align:middle line:84%
So that a lot of these
craft have these giant,

00:58:36.340 --> 00:58:39.730 align:middle line:84%
long, elongated crystals
in the bottom of them.

00:58:39.730 --> 00:58:42.970 align:middle line:84%
And they are the power
source of the craft

00:58:42.970 --> 00:58:46.930 align:middle line:84%
and also, can help heal
the beings in the craft.

00:58:46.930 --> 00:58:53.463 align:middle line:10%
All right, let's go ahead and
since-- oh, OK, one last story,

00:58:53.463 --> 00:58:55.130 align:middle line:10%
then we'll do questions,
because we only

00:58:55.130 --> 00:58:56.600 align:middle line:10%
got a couple more minutes.

00:58:56.600 --> 00:58:57.910 align:middle line:10%
Do you want me to explain this?

00:58:57.910 --> 00:58:58.336 align:middle line:10%
>> Yes.

00:58:58.336 --> 00:58:59.150 align:middle line:10%
>> Yeah, yeah.

00:58:59.150 --> 00:58:59.950 align:middle line:10%
>> Oi.

00:58:59.950 --> 00:59:01.283 align:middle line:90%
This was supposed to be a video.

00:59:01.283 --> 00:59:03.092 align:middle line:84%
Let's see if we
have the video one.

00:59:03.092 --> 00:59:04.870 align:middle line:90%
Let's see if it will play.

00:59:04.870 --> 00:59:08.110 align:middle line:10%
So what had happened
was, on a mission,

00:59:08.110 --> 00:59:12.250 align:middle line:10%
we were out in this
desert-like area.

00:59:12.250 --> 00:59:15.550 align:middle line:10%
There was these giant
lotus-cactus things.

00:59:15.550 --> 00:59:17.890 align:middle line:10%
And we heard one of
our botanists screaming

00:59:17.890 --> 00:59:22.840 align:middle line:10%
and yelling, and we knew
exactly when that happens,

00:59:22.840 --> 00:59:25.060 align:middle line:10%
everyone goes into rescue mode.

00:59:25.060 --> 00:59:29.400 align:middle line:10%
And this plant which
actually, these tentacles

00:59:29.400 --> 00:59:30.400 align:middle line:10%
are not all the way out.

00:59:30.400 --> 00:59:31.760 align:middle line:84%
They're actually
shooting upward.

00:59:31.760 --> 00:59:33.177 align:middle line:84%
They just stay
straight like this,

00:59:33.177 --> 00:59:36.370 align:middle line:84%
but they can fold out
50 feet and grab you.

00:59:36.370 --> 00:59:38.770 align:middle line:84%
And what had happened was,
she was getting too close,

00:59:38.770 --> 00:59:40.900 align:middle line:84%
and it grabbed her leg,
and it was pulling her

00:59:40.900 --> 00:59:44.920 align:middle line:84%
into the center of this
thing to consume her.

00:59:44.920 --> 00:59:48.040 align:middle line:84%
We-- luckily enough, the
canine got there before us,

00:59:48.040 --> 00:59:49.390 align:middle line:90%
grabbed her.

00:59:49.390 --> 00:59:50.770 align:middle line:90%
And with our knives--

00:59:50.770 --> 00:59:52.600 align:middle line:90%
we have knives on us.

00:59:52.600 --> 00:59:55.600 align:middle line:84%
We actually dissected
the tentacle off

00:59:55.600 --> 01:00:01.600 align:middle line:84%
and brought the girl from
being swallowed by this thing.

01:00:01.600 --> 01:00:04.930 align:middle line:10%
Now, what was interesting
is, these plants

01:00:04.930 --> 01:00:07.750 align:middle line:10%
happen to be
precisely about three,

01:00:07.750 --> 01:00:10.810 align:middle line:10%
about 100 yards from each other
through this little desert

01:00:10.810 --> 01:00:13.365 align:middle line:10%
area, so they're
very territorial.

01:00:13.365 --> 01:00:15.490 align:middle line:84%
So they would eat each
other if they got too close.

01:00:15.490 --> 01:00:16.290 align:middle line:90%
>> Wow.

01:00:16.290 --> 01:00:20.290 align:middle line:84%
>> And we did find a type
of deer-looking creature,

01:00:20.290 --> 01:00:24.760 align:middle line:84%
skinless type deer in one of
the center of this thing being

01:00:24.760 --> 01:00:27.640 align:middle line:84%
digested in these
enzymes that it had.

01:00:27.640 --> 01:00:29.590 align:middle line:10%
And we had taken lots
of samples of this,

01:00:29.590 --> 01:00:33.070 align:middle line:10%
but it was a very horrifying
moment for all, for everyone

01:00:33.070 --> 01:00:34.770 align:middle line:10%
on that mission there.

01:00:34.770 --> 01:00:35.782 align:middle line:10%
OK, go ahead.

01:00:35.782 --> 01:00:37.240 align:middle line:10%
Let's do some
questions real quick.

01:00:37.240 --> 01:00:38.440 align:middle line:90%
Who's got the mic?

01:00:38.440 --> 01:00:39.240 align:middle line:90%
All right.

01:00:39.240 --> 01:00:42.083 align:middle line:84%
>> So with these giant
crafts that crash,

01:00:42.083 --> 01:00:44.500 align:middle line:84%
they don't all crash in the
middle of nowhere where no one

01:00:44.500 --> 01:00:46.280 align:middle line:90%
sees them, right?

01:00:46.280 --> 01:00:47.080 align:middle line:90%
>> No.

01:00:47.080 --> 01:00:50.020 align:middle line:84%
There's actually been
craft documented in cities.

01:00:50.020 --> 01:00:53.660 align:middle line:84%
They cover it up pretty well,
kind of like they covered up

01:00:53.660 --> 01:00:54.460 align:middle line:90%
the towers.

01:00:54.460 --> 01:00:57.340 align:middle line:90%


01:00:57.340 --> 01:01:01.090 align:middle line:84%
It happens, and then you hear
things about massive fires

01:01:01.090 --> 01:01:03.440 align:middle line:90%
starting in cities.

01:01:03.440 --> 01:01:08.440 align:middle line:84%
And these are not just
normal fires in big cities

01:01:08.440 --> 01:01:10.300 align:middle line:90%
that just come out of nowhere.

01:01:10.300 --> 01:01:13.870 align:middle line:84%
These are actually craft that
have crashed into buildings.

01:01:13.870 --> 01:01:17.740 align:middle line:84%
And the other thing too is, I
want you to get away from size,

01:01:17.740 --> 01:01:24.040 align:middle line:84%
because this whole room can
fit into a one inch little golf

01:01:24.040 --> 01:01:29.410 align:middle line:84%
ball here, because
we're 99% space.

01:01:29.410 --> 01:01:34.870 align:middle line:84%
And when you have that
interdimensional technology,

01:01:34.870 --> 01:01:38.230 align:middle line:84%
all I'm saying is, this
doesn't really exist.

01:01:38.230 --> 01:01:42.940 align:middle line:84%
You can shrink us all down into
one grain of sand in this room,

01:01:42.940 --> 01:01:45.510 align:middle line:84%
and we can blow it back up,
and that's how they travel.

01:01:45.510 --> 01:01:47.710 align:middle line:90%
>> Wow.

01:01:47.710 --> 01:01:49.420 align:middle line:90%
>> Good question.

01:01:49.420 --> 01:01:50.570 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, hello.

01:01:50.570 --> 01:01:51.370 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

01:01:51.370 --> 01:01:54.250 align:middle line:84%
I noticed that a lot
of the different aliens

01:01:54.250 --> 01:01:57.280 align:middle line:84%
had some similar
features and stuff.

01:01:57.280 --> 01:01:59.620 align:middle line:84%
They look sort of
similar in some ways.

01:01:59.620 --> 01:02:02.380 align:middle line:84%
They had their differences,
but some similarities.

01:02:02.380 --> 01:02:06.070 align:middle line:84%
Is there some-- have they
noticed genetically if they

01:02:06.070 --> 01:02:06.870 align:middle line:90%
have a common--

01:02:06.870 --> 01:02:07.670 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

01:02:07.670 --> 01:02:08.740 align:middle line:90%
>> --ancestry there?

01:02:08.740 --> 01:02:09.700 align:middle line:90%
>> Absolutely.

01:02:09.700 --> 01:02:13.890 align:middle line:84%
I'm dying for them to
release the genetic bank

01:02:13.890 --> 01:02:18.190 align:middle line:84%
of these extraterrestrials,
and the plant life, and animal

01:02:18.190 --> 01:02:22.510 align:middle line:84%
life on other planets,
because what we have found out

01:02:22.510 --> 01:02:26.230 align:middle line:84%
through pretty much all the
extraterrestrials that I

01:02:26.230 --> 01:02:29.110 align:middle line:84%
was involved with in the
dissecting, that they

01:02:29.110 --> 01:02:30.085 align:middle line:90%
have human DNA.

01:02:30.085 --> 01:02:32.910 align:middle line:90%


01:02:32.910 --> 01:02:35.682 align:middle line:84%
And this whole thing about,
we have 98% junk DNA,

01:02:35.682 --> 01:02:36.640 align:middle line:90%
I know where it's from.

01:02:36.640 --> 01:02:39.070 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

01:02:39.070 --> 01:02:41.590 align:middle line:84%
And that's what is
really so compelling is,

01:02:41.590 --> 01:02:45.040 align:middle line:90%
we are the extraterrestrials.

01:02:45.040 --> 01:02:45.920 align:middle line:90%
Right, Geo?

01:02:45.920 --> 01:02:48.450 align:middle line:90%


01:02:48.450 --> 01:02:50.020 align:middle line:90%
We're the extraterrestrials.

01:02:50.020 --> 01:02:52.300 align:middle line:84%
We have their DNA,
they have our DNA,

01:02:52.300 --> 01:02:53.870 align:middle line:90%
and that has to be released.

01:02:53.870 --> 01:02:54.670 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

01:02:54.670 --> 01:02:55.570 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

01:02:55.570 --> 01:03:01.000 align:middle line:10%
>> They're using that
information to help make

01:03:01.000 --> 01:03:05.500 align:middle line:10%
weapons and to also help heal
over a longer period of time,

01:03:05.500 --> 01:03:08.260 align:middle line:10%
and it's not right.

01:03:08.260 --> 01:03:11.530 align:middle line:10%
So well, we have to put
that energy out there

01:03:11.530 --> 01:03:14.074 align:middle line:10%
that information gets released.

01:03:14.074 --> 01:03:14.938 align:middle line:90%
>> Over here.

01:03:14.938 --> 01:03:16.240 align:middle line:90%
Go.

01:03:16.240 --> 01:03:19.420 align:middle line:84%
>> Can you share your
understanding or opinion about

01:03:19.420 --> 01:03:25.300 align:middle line:84%
how extraterrestrial contact for
regular civilians is made apart

01:03:25.300 --> 01:03:28.450 align:middle line:84%
from somebody like yourself that
directly is in a program where

01:03:28.450 --> 01:03:32.440 align:middle line:84%
you are human to
extraterrestrial?

01:03:32.440 --> 01:03:35.418 align:middle line:84%
Some people believe that
their consciousness expands,

01:03:35.418 --> 01:03:37.210 align:middle line:84%
and then they put it
out into the universe,

01:03:37.210 --> 01:03:39.520 align:middle line:84%
and then there's a
dream of a Nordic that's

01:03:39.520 --> 01:03:41.950 align:middle line:90%
making contact or vise versa?

01:03:41.950 --> 01:03:45.190 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, you have to be
careful of this thing between

01:03:45.190 --> 01:03:49.540 align:middle line:84%
your ears, this
big thing of fat.

01:03:49.540 --> 01:03:51.910 align:middle line:84%
Your brain here can
take over, and you

01:03:51.910 --> 01:03:55.090 align:middle line:84%
can get side tracked because
of all the programming of what

01:03:55.090 --> 01:03:57.113 align:middle line:84%
you've seen on TV
or scary movies.

01:03:57.113 --> 01:03:59.530 align:middle line:84%
And course, Hollywood puts out
these evil extraterrestrial

01:03:59.530 --> 01:04:03.790 align:middle line:84%
movies every month, and it
doesn't need to be like that.

01:04:03.790 --> 01:04:08.230 align:middle line:84%
And once you know that you
can be fooled here, because I

01:04:08.230 --> 01:04:09.670 align:middle line:90%
don't trust anything now.

01:04:09.670 --> 01:04:11.920 align:middle line:84%
After what I've
seen, I know they

01:04:11.920 --> 01:04:14.560 align:middle line:84%
can make it look like
there's a car sitting

01:04:14.560 --> 01:04:16.900 align:middle line:84%
right there, casting a
shadow even in the sun.

01:04:16.900 --> 01:04:19.510 align:middle line:10%
And I can go right up to there,
and that holographic image

01:04:19.510 --> 01:04:21.550 align:middle line:10%
is that good that
it actually can

01:04:21.550 --> 01:04:25.630 align:middle line:10%
be palpable for a little
bit before your hand goes

01:04:25.630 --> 01:04:27.160 align:middle line:10%
through it, because
they know how

01:04:27.160 --> 01:04:31.220 align:middle line:10%
to rearrange the atoms, and
the photons, and electrons now.

01:04:31.220 --> 01:04:34.240 align:middle line:84%
So even though you think that's
a jet flying through the sky,

01:04:34.240 --> 01:04:38.710 align:middle line:84%
it's an alleged type of aircraft
or maybe just a hologram.

01:04:38.710 --> 01:04:41.260 align:middle line:84%
What I'm getting at is, you
have to free yourself from that

01:04:41.260 --> 01:04:44.140 align:middle line:84%
and be aware that
you are not alone,

01:04:44.140 --> 01:04:46.495 align:middle line:84%
and there are
extraterrestrials out there.

01:04:46.495 --> 01:04:48.880 align:middle line:84%
OK, just because our
government, the United States,

01:04:48.880 --> 01:04:50.422 align:middle line:84%
doesn't really want
you to know that,

01:04:50.422 --> 01:04:52.438 align:middle line:84%
but everyone else is
releasing their files,

01:04:52.438 --> 01:04:53.980 align:middle line:84%
and it's all online,
but no one talks

01:04:53.980 --> 01:04:56.290 align:middle line:84%
about the biggest
story on the planet,

01:04:56.290 --> 01:04:58.340 align:middle line:84%
because CNN doesn't
want to talk about it.

01:04:58.340 --> 01:04:59.140 align:middle line:90%
Sorry.

01:04:59.140 --> 01:05:00.600 align:middle line:84%
I shouldn't have
said that, but--

01:05:00.600 --> 01:05:02.880 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

01:05:02.880 --> 01:05:06.490 align:middle line:84%
It's just, the media
is controlling it.

01:05:06.490 --> 01:05:10.060 align:middle line:84%
The best thing I can tell you
to do is find a quiet space

01:05:10.060 --> 01:05:12.190 align:middle line:90%
and get outside.

01:05:12.190 --> 01:05:14.830 align:middle line:84%
How many of you, in
the last 24 hours,

01:05:14.830 --> 01:05:17.500 align:middle line:84%
have actually looked
up at the sky?

01:05:17.500 --> 01:05:20.388 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, that's good.

01:05:20.388 --> 01:05:21.430 align:middle line:90%
You're in the right room.

01:05:21.430 --> 01:05:23.470 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

01:05:23.470 --> 01:05:26.920 align:middle line:84%
So get outside, and stop
looking here, stop looking here,

01:05:26.920 --> 01:05:28.510 align:middle line:90%
and start looking up there.

01:05:28.510 --> 01:05:32.200 align:middle line:84%
And be aware, and ask
for communication.

01:05:32.200 --> 01:05:33.820 align:middle line:90%
Say, I am ready.

01:05:33.820 --> 01:05:35.550 align:middle line:84%
OK, you don't need
to say it out loud.

01:05:35.550 --> 01:05:36.550 align:middle line:10%
You can say it out loud.

01:05:36.550 --> 01:05:38.717 align:middle line:10%
Don't run out your neighbors
and be like, I'm ready.

01:05:38.717 --> 01:05:39.980 align:middle line:10%
[LAUGHTER]

01:05:39.980 --> 01:05:42.520 align:middle line:90%
Emery Smith said I'm ready.

01:05:42.520 --> 01:05:45.400 align:middle line:84%
No, you're ready, and
you're not scared.

01:05:45.400 --> 01:05:48.013 align:middle line:84%
Because I have a lot of people
we take out, including media,

01:05:48.013 --> 01:05:49.180 align:middle line:90%
and they're like, I'm ready.

01:05:49.180 --> 01:05:49.510 align:middle line:90%
We're ready.

01:05:49.510 --> 01:05:50.560 align:middle line:90%
We want to see it now.

01:05:50.560 --> 01:05:52.893 align:middle line:84%
And you get out there, and
as soon as something happens,

01:05:52.893 --> 01:05:55.270 align:middle line:90%
they're running down the trail.

01:05:55.270 --> 01:05:56.320 align:middle line:90%
You're not ready.

01:05:56.320 --> 01:05:57.875 align:middle line:90%
Are you're really ready?

01:05:57.875 --> 01:06:00.100 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

01:06:00.100 --> 01:06:03.100 align:middle line:84%
You're not ready, because
we can't even get along

01:06:03.100 --> 01:06:05.095 align:middle line:90%
with each other on this planet.

01:06:05.095 --> 01:06:06.970 align:middle line:84%
And how the heck are we
supposed to get along

01:06:06.970 --> 01:06:11.500 align:middle line:84%
with someone else a few
thousand light-years away?

01:06:11.500 --> 01:06:14.240 align:middle line:84%
We need to stop
that and become one,

01:06:14.240 --> 01:06:16.615 align:middle line:90%
because we are all the same.

01:06:16.615 --> 01:06:19.216 align:middle line:90%
I can prove it with genetics.

01:06:19.216 --> 01:06:20.620 align:middle line:90%
Go ahead.

01:06:20.620 --> 01:06:23.180 align:middle line:84%
>> So it's a two-part question
I first was going to ask you

01:06:23.180 --> 01:06:23.530 align:middle line:90%
right here.

01:06:23.530 --> 01:06:25.447 align:middle line:84%
I was going to ask you
if you think that we're

01:06:25.447 --> 01:06:27.220 align:middle line:90%
being watched and protected?

01:06:27.220 --> 01:06:28.900 align:middle line:84%
And then the second
part is, when do you

01:06:28.900 --> 01:06:31.270 align:middle line:84%
think these healing technologies
are going to come out?

01:06:31.270 --> 01:06:32.920 align:middle line:84%
>> The healing technology
is already coming out,

01:06:32.920 --> 01:06:34.360 align:middle line:90%
ever since I've come forward.

01:06:34.360 --> 01:06:35.830 align:middle line:90%
There's always new technologies.

01:06:35.830 --> 01:06:38.555 align:middle line:84%
I know I've mentioned some
materials online and healing

01:06:38.555 --> 01:06:39.355 align:middle line:90%
technologies.

01:06:39.355 --> 01:06:43.270 align:middle line:84%
And within a year, we
see it in magazines.

01:06:43.270 --> 01:06:47.980 align:middle line:84%
So talking about it,
exposing it slowly

01:06:47.980 --> 01:06:49.990 align:middle line:90%
is a great way to do that.

01:06:49.990 --> 01:06:52.720 align:middle line:84%
Yes, we're always
being watched, not only

01:06:52.720 --> 01:06:56.720 align:middle line:84%
by the extraterrestrials,
but by my personal tracking

01:06:56.720 --> 01:06:57.520 align:middle line:90%
device here.

01:06:57.520 --> 01:06:59.240 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

01:06:59.240 --> 01:07:00.040 align:middle line:90%
You're always.

01:07:00.040 --> 01:07:02.000 align:middle line:84%
There's no secrets
on this planet.

01:07:02.000 --> 01:07:02.890 align:middle line:90%
I'm sorry.

01:07:02.890 --> 01:07:08.020 align:middle line:84%
And eventually, even as soon
as two decades from now,

01:07:08.020 --> 01:07:11.920 align:middle line:84%
people will be able to go
on a computer mainframe

01:07:11.920 --> 01:07:14.470 align:middle line:84%
and come back to
this point, this GPS

01:07:14.470 --> 01:07:16.900 align:middle line:84%
coordinate off the
ground, and you

01:07:16.900 --> 01:07:19.160 align:middle line:84%
can listen to me
again and watch me,

01:07:19.160 --> 01:07:20.813 align:middle line:90%
and they're already doing it.

01:07:20.813 --> 01:07:23.230 align:middle line:84%
So if you think you're going
in the closet in the bathroom

01:07:23.230 --> 01:07:24.272 align:middle line:90%
and talking on the phone.

01:07:24.272 --> 01:07:25.660 align:middle line:90%
Oh my gosh.

01:07:25.660 --> 01:07:27.520 align:middle line:84%
Can you bring me
some toilet paper?

01:07:27.520 --> 01:07:29.697 align:middle line:84%
No, everyone's
going to know about.

01:07:29.697 --> 01:07:31.030 align:middle line:90%
There is going to be no secrets.

01:07:31.030 --> 01:07:34.170 align:middle line:84%
And communication is
going to get an up, up,

01:07:34.170 --> 01:07:38.710 align:middle line:84%
up-regulatory state here soon
when we start using telepathy.

01:07:38.710 --> 01:07:41.110 align:middle line:84%
And that's going to be the
biggest advancement for us,

01:07:41.110 --> 01:07:46.240 align:middle line:84%
because communication is what's
causing wars and distrust,

01:07:46.240 --> 01:07:49.600 align:middle line:84%
just because we can't
understand each other.

01:07:49.600 --> 01:07:51.880 align:middle line:90%
Yeah?

01:07:51.880 --> 01:07:52.895 align:middle line:90%
>> A two-part question.

01:07:52.895 --> 01:07:53.260 align:middle line:90%
One--

01:07:53.260 --> 01:07:53.840 align:middle line:90%
>> Did I get it all?

01:07:53.840 --> 01:07:54.210 align:middle line:90%
Wait, hold on.

01:07:54.210 --> 01:07:54.810 align:middle line:90%
Did I get it all?

01:07:54.810 --> 01:07:56.916 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, yeah, but when do you
think the telepathy thing will

01:07:56.916 --> 01:07:57.716 align:middle line:90%
come into play?

01:07:57.716 --> 01:07:59.680 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, it's starting already.

01:07:59.680 --> 01:08:02.080 align:middle line:90%
It's slowly coming in.

01:08:02.080 --> 01:08:03.080 align:middle line:90%
I've been talking about.

01:08:03.080 --> 01:08:04.320 align:middle line:84%
There's a lot of other
colleagues out there.

01:08:04.320 --> 01:08:06.600 align:middle line:84%
There are going to be
courses on this soon,

01:08:06.600 --> 01:08:09.420 align:middle line:84%
and it's just a new
awakening for everyone.

01:08:09.420 --> 01:08:11.550 align:middle line:84%
It's a different
thought process.

01:08:11.550 --> 01:08:17.520 align:middle line:84%
Telepathy has to do with,
I can say something to you,

01:08:17.520 --> 01:08:19.930 align:middle line:90%
and you just hear one sentence.

01:08:19.930 --> 01:08:24.779 align:middle line:84%
Now, in telepathy, in
telepathy, you not only

01:08:24.779 --> 01:08:30.569 align:middle line:84%
hear what I said in your mind,
you see what I'm talking about.

01:08:30.569 --> 01:08:35.520 align:middle line:84%
You feel how I feel about
it, you see the colors,

01:08:35.520 --> 01:08:38.279 align:middle line:84%
you smell the smells,
and the sound.

01:08:38.279 --> 01:08:42.060 align:middle line:84%
It is the most
beautiful thing ever.

01:08:42.060 --> 01:08:46.048 align:middle line:84%
And many of you-- how many heard
my telepathy story with the ET

01:08:46.048 --> 01:08:47.590 align:middle line:84%
across from the
operating room table?

01:08:47.590 --> 01:08:49.990 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, I'm all excited one day.

01:08:49.990 --> 01:08:50.790 align:middle line:90%
It's Friday.

01:08:50.790 --> 01:08:52.020 align:middle line:90%
I got a hot date.

01:08:52.020 --> 01:08:53.553 align:middle line:90%
I want to get out of there.

01:08:53.553 --> 01:08:54.470 align:middle line:90%
And then he knows you.

01:08:54.470 --> 01:08:56.845 align:middle line:84%
Because when you go into a
room with an extraterrestrial,

01:08:56.845 --> 01:08:58.680 align:middle line:90%
you have to clear yourself.

01:08:58.680 --> 01:09:01.830 align:middle line:84%
Because if I just got in a
fight with someone at home,

01:09:01.830 --> 01:09:04.500 align:middle line:84%
and I'm really upset,
and I come inside,

01:09:04.500 --> 01:09:08.160 align:middle line:84%
and I'm going to work
with an extraterrestrial,

01:09:08.160 --> 01:09:12.270 align:middle line:84%
and I say hello to
them when I meet them,

01:09:12.270 --> 01:09:15.095 align:middle line:84%
but I'm so angry inside,
to them, it's hello!

01:09:15.095 --> 01:09:16.800 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

01:09:16.800 --> 01:09:19.700 align:middle line:90%
So, because it's emotion based.

01:09:19.700 --> 01:09:23.850 align:middle line:84%
It's beautiful because
there's no secrets,

01:09:23.850 --> 01:09:29.962 align:middle line:84%
but it's also very direct
and very humbling to know.

01:09:29.962 --> 01:09:30.824 align:middle line:90%
Go ahead.

01:09:30.824 --> 01:09:31.689 align:middle line:90%
>> Go ahead.

01:09:31.689 --> 01:09:32.620 align:middle line:90%
>> Two questions.

01:09:32.620 --> 01:09:35.140 align:middle line:84%
One is, are you at
liberty to share

01:09:35.140 --> 01:09:38.060 align:middle line:84%
the name of tenants
for the military bases,

01:09:38.060 --> 01:09:40.000 align:middle line:90%
the names of corporations?

01:09:40.000 --> 01:09:43.420 align:middle line:84%
And number two, you mentioned
when they come here,

01:09:43.420 --> 01:09:44.950 align:middle line:90%
they pick up our qualities.

01:09:44.950 --> 01:09:47.870 align:middle line:84%
When we go there, do we
pick up their qualities?

01:09:47.870 --> 01:09:48.670 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

01:09:48.670 --> 01:09:52.870 align:middle line:84%
Being in any presence of any
extraterrestrial or other

01:09:52.870 --> 01:09:56.260 align:middle line:84%
person, you will definitely
take on the traits of--

01:09:56.260 --> 01:09:58.840 align:middle line:84%
and that's just normal
with us here, too.

01:09:58.840 --> 01:10:01.870 align:middle line:84%
And that's why there's
people that adopt a child.

01:10:01.870 --> 01:10:03.370 align:middle line:84%
And all the sudden,
the child starts

01:10:03.370 --> 01:10:05.260 align:middle line:84%
acting like the mom
and dad, even though--

01:10:05.260 --> 01:10:07.690 align:middle line:84%
and starts looking like them,
but they're not actually

01:10:07.690 --> 01:10:08.830 align:middle line:90%
biological parents.

01:10:08.830 --> 01:10:12.250 align:middle line:90%
But that's really your child.

01:10:12.250 --> 01:10:16.210 align:middle line:84%
As far as the corporations,
I don't talk about that.

01:10:16.210 --> 01:10:18.850 align:middle line:84%
But just look up some of the
top 10 aerospace corporations

01:10:18.850 --> 01:10:22.073 align:middle line:84%
out there, and they'll
give you a start.

01:10:22.073 --> 01:10:23.740 align:middle line:84%
And of course, the
banking corporations,

01:10:23.740 --> 01:10:28.660 align:middle line:84%
gas, coal, and oil, and their
communications is one of them.

01:10:28.660 --> 01:10:29.550 align:middle line:90%
Uh-huh, go ahead.

01:10:29.550 --> 01:10:32.280 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, so I have a couple of
questions with the regenerative

01:10:32.280 --> 01:10:32.675 align:middle line:90%
medicine--

01:10:32.675 --> 01:10:33.475 align:middle line:90%
>> Sure.

01:10:33.475 --> 01:10:34.290 align:middle line:90%
>> --and all that.

01:10:34.290 --> 01:10:37.980 align:middle line:84%
I would love specifics, but I
think you talked once about--

01:10:37.980 --> 01:10:39.870 align:middle line:84%
I think it was a Med
Bed that you went into?

01:10:39.870 --> 01:10:40.703 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes, the Med Bed.

01:10:40.703 --> 01:10:42.630 align:middle line:90%
Mm-hmm.

01:10:42.630 --> 01:10:45.810 align:middle line:84%
>> Are we going to be
able to have those?

01:10:45.810 --> 01:10:48.520 align:middle line:90%
I have a beam ray, and I can--

01:10:48.520 --> 01:10:51.320 align:middle line:84%
I have healed my thyroid
with my beam ray.

01:10:51.320 --> 01:10:55.195 align:middle line:90%
And that's like a real thing.

01:10:55.195 --> 01:10:56.070 align:middle line:90%
>> It's a real thing.

01:10:56.070 --> 01:10:56.560 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

01:10:56.560 --> 01:10:58.080 align:middle line:84%
>> And they're getting
better and better at it.

01:10:58.080 --> 01:10:59.163 align:middle line:90%
These beds are coming out.

01:10:59.163 --> 01:11:03.330 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I was just talking
to a couple of my colleagues

01:11:03.330 --> 01:11:05.550 align:middle line:84%
just a couple of
days ago, yesterday.

01:11:05.550 --> 01:11:07.195 align:middle line:84%
And we were talking
about looking--

01:11:07.195 --> 01:11:08.070 align:middle line:90%
>> One more question.

01:11:08.070 --> 01:11:09.600 align:middle line:84%
>> --at what's
already out there.

01:11:09.600 --> 01:11:11.382 align:middle line:10%
And there's a lot
of corporations

01:11:11.382 --> 01:11:12.840 align:middle line:10%
that are coming
out with these beds

01:11:12.840 --> 01:11:15.330 align:middle line:10%
that you sit in
that use frequency

01:11:15.330 --> 01:11:18.390 align:middle line:10%
and harmonics to help
get your body realigned

01:11:18.390 --> 01:11:22.350 align:middle line:10%
and get back into the right
voltage so it can heal itself.

01:11:22.350 --> 01:11:25.050 align:middle line:10%
So it's already here,
and it's coming.

01:11:25.050 --> 01:11:27.420 align:middle line:10%
The ones that I've spoke
about in the projects

01:11:27.420 --> 01:11:30.330 align:middle line:10%
are a little bit further
out, but they are already 3D

01:11:30.330 --> 01:11:33.000 align:middle line:10%
printing organs, as you know.

01:11:33.000 --> 01:11:34.450 align:middle line:10%
We can 3D print a body.

01:11:34.450 --> 01:11:35.250 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

01:11:35.250 --> 01:11:39.660 align:middle line:84%
>> So I think we're already
a good 300 to 500 years more

01:11:39.660 --> 01:11:42.240 align:middle line:84%
advanced medically in the
projects compared to what

01:11:42.240 --> 01:11:43.040 align:middle line:90%
you're seeing now.

01:11:43.040 --> 01:11:45.373 align:middle line:84%
And it's great that they're
coming out saying, oh, look.

01:11:45.373 --> 01:11:47.400 align:middle line:10%
We cloned this, we cloned
that, cloned a pig,

01:11:47.400 --> 01:11:48.960 align:middle line:10%
and put a pig with a human.

01:11:48.960 --> 01:11:49.920 align:middle line:10%
Now we got a pig boy.

01:11:49.920 --> 01:11:50.940 align:middle line:10%
Yeah.

01:11:50.940 --> 01:11:51.840 align:middle line:10%
But it's real.

01:11:51.840 --> 01:11:54.290 align:middle line:84%
It's on-- it's real
stuff that's going on.

01:11:54.290 --> 01:11:54.360 align:middle line:90%
Check--

01:11:54.360 --> 01:11:55.235 align:middle line:90%
>> What's a beam ray?

01:11:55.235 --> 01:11:56.560 align:middle line:90%
>> And then--

01:11:56.560 --> 01:11:57.360 align:middle line:90%
>> The sec--

01:11:57.360 --> 01:11:58.920 align:middle line:90%
>> What's a beam ray?

01:11:58.920 --> 01:12:01.410 align:middle line:84%
>> It's a plasma
frequency device.

01:12:01.410 --> 01:12:03.900 align:middle line:84%
It's light and sound, so it's
kind of under the tenants

01:12:03.900 --> 01:12:07.000 align:middle line:90%
that everything is frequency.

01:12:07.000 --> 01:12:09.690 align:middle line:90%
B-E-A-M R-A-Y. However--

01:12:09.690 --> 01:12:10.900 align:middle line:90%
>> Do you have a beamer mat?

01:12:10.900 --> 01:12:11.700 align:middle line:90%
>> No.

01:12:11.700 --> 01:12:12.140 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, OK.

01:12:12.140 --> 01:12:12.940 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

01:12:12.940 --> 01:12:15.540 align:middle line:84%
And there's a lot of
companies that make stuff,

01:12:15.540 --> 01:12:18.480 align:middle line:84%
but you kind of have to
know where to get it,

01:12:18.480 --> 01:12:19.370 align:middle line:90%
because I think--

01:12:19.370 --> 01:12:21.810 align:middle line:84%
>> But let's go ahead and
get it to another person,

01:12:21.810 --> 01:12:22.780 align:middle line:84%
because we only have
a couple things, but--

01:12:22.780 --> 01:12:24.572 align:middle line:84%
>> Just the second half
of my question was,

01:12:24.572 --> 01:12:28.027 align:middle line:84%
knowing everything's frequency
and homeopathy has frequency,

01:12:28.027 --> 01:12:30.360 align:middle line:84%
everything has frequency, I
would just love if you could

01:12:30.360 --> 01:12:33.600 align:middle line:84%
extrapolate a little bit on
your opinion of the mandated

01:12:33.600 --> 01:12:38.670 align:middle line:84%
vaccinations and knowing that
many of them have dog DNA,

01:12:38.670 --> 01:12:40.120 align:middle line:90%
other people's DNA.

01:12:40.120 --> 01:12:43.235 align:middle line:84%
So if you ask a kindergartner,
oh, if I put cat DNA in you,

01:12:43.235 --> 01:12:44.610 align:middle line:84%
is that going to
be a good thing?

01:12:44.610 --> 01:12:46.570 align:middle line:90%
They'll say, no, so--

01:12:46.570 --> 01:12:47.653 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, I mean, I don't--

01:12:47.653 --> 01:12:48.945 align:middle line:90%
>> --love to know your opinion.

01:12:48.945 --> 01:12:49.770 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

01:12:49.770 --> 01:12:53.100 align:middle line:10%
As far as the animal
DNA being in you,

01:12:53.100 --> 01:12:55.020 align:middle line:10%
that's not going to harm you.

01:12:55.020 --> 01:12:59.850 align:middle line:84%
It's the chemicals and the
reverse-engineered genetics

01:12:59.850 --> 01:13:02.460 align:middle line:84%
that they have put in
there that's very bad.

01:13:02.460 --> 01:13:05.528 align:middle line:84%
There are-- I know they make
it mandatory, especially

01:13:05.528 --> 01:13:07.320 align:middle line:84%
for clinicians when
you work in a hospital.

01:13:07.320 --> 01:13:12.330 align:middle line:84%
We have to get these
vaccinations or we cannot work.

01:13:12.330 --> 01:13:13.470 align:middle line:90%
It's horrible.

01:13:13.470 --> 01:13:17.310 align:middle line:84%
When you go to school,
they require the flu shots

01:13:17.310 --> 01:13:20.560 align:middle line:90%
against vaccinations.

01:13:20.560 --> 01:13:21.970 align:middle line:90%
>> Thank you, Emery.

01:13:21.970 --> 01:13:25.800 align:middle line:90%
>> [INAUDIBLE]

01:13:25.800 --> 01:13:26.910 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

01:13:26.910 --> 01:13:28.680 align:middle line:90%
The vaccinations are bad.

01:13:28.680 --> 01:13:30.370 align:middle line:90%
They've always been bad.

01:13:30.370 --> 01:13:34.650 align:middle line:84%
There's a hidden agenda to
wipe out certain lineages here

01:13:34.650 --> 01:13:38.460 align:middle line:84%
on the planet when they want to
by releasing certain chemicals

01:13:38.460 --> 01:13:40.260 align:middle line:84%
into the atmosphere,
that they just want

01:13:40.260 --> 01:13:43.100 align:middle line:90%
to take out a certain race.

01:13:43.100 --> 01:13:46.060 align:middle line:84%
And that's all-- we're all
exposed to a lot of this stuff.

01:13:46.060 --> 01:13:52.500 align:middle line:84%
But like I said, we're
very adaptive to getting

01:13:52.500 --> 01:13:53.700 align:middle line:90%
through a lot of this stuff.

01:13:53.700 --> 01:13:57.620 align:middle line:84%
And our bodies do fight this,
or absorb it, and turn it,

01:13:57.620 --> 01:13:59.283 align:middle line:90%
and you can transmute it.

01:13:59.283 --> 01:14:01.200 align:middle line:84%
And if you want to know
more about transmuting

01:14:01.200 --> 01:14:04.500 align:middle line:84%
your energies in your bodies,
we have Randy Veitenheimer here.

01:14:04.500 --> 01:14:07.650 align:middle line:84%
Come tomorrow or get him
after this little talk.

01:14:07.650 --> 01:14:11.700 align:middle line:84%
I'm going right now
to the Gaia Room,

01:14:11.700 --> 01:14:15.060 align:middle line:84%
and we're going to be
talking about the GaiaSphere.

01:14:15.060 --> 01:14:16.810 align:middle line:90%
Check this guy out real quick.

01:14:16.810 --> 01:14:19.740 align:middle line:84%
They're kicking me out,
but I'm I keep talking.

01:14:19.740 --> 01:14:20.760 align:middle line:90%
Isn't that cool?

01:14:20.760 --> 01:14:23.250 align:middle line:84%
Oh my gosh, I wish I could
talk more about this stuff.

01:14:23.250 --> 01:14:26.220 align:middle line:84%
I'm just going to zoom
through it, because I've

01:14:26.220 --> 01:14:30.840 align:middle line:84%
got a couple of things I do
have to say, because there is--

01:14:30.840 --> 01:14:32.100 align:middle line:90%
look at this.

01:14:32.100 --> 01:14:33.790 align:middle line:90%
Whoa.

01:14:33.790 --> 01:14:36.070 align:middle line:10%
Yeah, look at that portal.

01:14:36.070 --> 01:14:37.860 align:middle line:10%
Yeah.

01:14:37.860 --> 01:14:40.710 align:middle line:10%
Really appreciate you
guys for having me here.

01:14:40.710 --> 01:14:42.990 align:middle line:90%
And want to say, love you guys.

01:14:42.990 --> 01:14:43.830 align:middle line:90%
Thank you so much.

01:14:43.830 --> 01:14:45.330 align:middle line:90%
