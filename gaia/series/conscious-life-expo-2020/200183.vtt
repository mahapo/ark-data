00:00:02.910 --> 00:00:06.790 align:middle line:90%


00:00:06.790 --> 00:00:09.620 align:middle line:90%
>> Good morning, everyone.

00:00:09.620 --> 00:00:11.840 align:middle line:10%
Thanks for coming to
this workshop today,

00:00:11.840 --> 00:00:15.100 align:middle line:10%
and I'm really excited to
be sharing with you some--

00:00:15.100 --> 00:00:17.380 align:middle line:10%
how many of you have
been watching my Gaia

00:00:17.380 --> 00:00:19.340 align:middle line:10%
series "Mystery Teachings?"

00:00:19.340 --> 00:00:22.430 align:middle line:84%
OK, and did you get all
the way through season two?

00:00:22.430 --> 00:00:23.230 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:00:23.230 --> 00:00:26.170 align:middle line:84%
Because today is
very much about what

00:00:26.170 --> 00:00:28.880 align:middle line:84%
I addressed in the second
half of season two,

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:31.160 align:middle line:84%
but we're going to
really experience it.

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:34.300 align:middle line:84%
So for those of you who
are a little newer to me,

00:00:34.300 --> 00:00:39.640 align:middle line:84%
my passion really is in bridging
science with metaphysics,

00:00:39.640 --> 00:00:43.270 align:middle line:84%
with spirituality, but in a
way that is really practical

00:00:43.270 --> 00:00:46.510 align:middle line:84%
and applied where we can take
these tools into our life

00:00:46.510 --> 00:00:49.240 align:middle line:84%
to create transformation,
to make a difference,

00:00:49.240 --> 00:00:53.410 align:middle line:84%
to awaken more of our
potential, and really access

00:00:53.410 --> 00:00:55.340 align:middle line:90%
those gifts that are within us.

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:58.480 align:middle line:84%
So today is a little
bit of an experience,

00:00:58.480 --> 00:01:02.140 align:middle line:84%
a little bit a taste of that,
as well as a lot of teachings

00:01:02.140 --> 00:01:04.840 align:middle line:84%
to help pull together
all the different aspects

00:01:04.840 --> 00:01:10.390 align:middle line:84%
of our amazing brain,
neurological system, our mind,

00:01:10.390 --> 00:01:14.803 align:middle line:84%
our consciousness, and
how it all ties together.

00:01:14.803 --> 00:01:16.720 align:middle line:84%
And what we're going to
be talking about today

00:01:16.720 --> 00:01:19.690 align:middle line:84%
is very much about something
called the connectome.

00:01:19.690 --> 00:01:23.740 align:middle line:84%
Does anyone know what
the connectome means?

00:01:23.740 --> 00:01:26.990 align:middle line:84%
I didn't either until
I read about it.

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:29.890 align:middle line:84%
The connectome is
the connections,

00:01:29.890 --> 00:01:33.280 align:middle line:84%
the neural networks that
connect between different brain

00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:34.420 align:middle line:90%
regions.

00:01:34.420 --> 00:01:36.922 align:middle line:84%
So you have-- for
example, we've mostly

00:01:36.922 --> 00:01:38.380 align:middle line:84%
heard about the
hemispheres, right?

00:01:38.380 --> 00:01:40.120 align:middle line:84%
We have our right brain
and our left brain,

00:01:40.120 --> 00:01:41.980 align:middle line:84%
or our right hemisphere
and left hemisphere,

00:01:41.980 --> 00:01:44.210 align:middle line:84%
and between those
two hemispheres,

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:48.190 align:middle line:84%
there's a connective circuit
called the corpus callosum.

00:01:48.190 --> 00:01:50.050 align:middle line:84%
So that's one
example, but you also

00:01:50.050 --> 00:01:52.090 align:middle line:84%
have different
connection circuits

00:01:52.090 --> 00:01:54.850 align:middle line:84%
between different areas
of the brain, deeper areas

00:01:54.850 --> 00:01:56.270 align:middle line:90%
of the brain, and so forth.

00:01:56.270 --> 00:01:58.630 align:middle line:84%
And what scientists
have been finding

00:01:58.630 --> 00:02:03.250 align:middle line:84%
is that when we have
high connectivity,

00:02:03.250 --> 00:02:06.790 align:middle line:84%
when we have really good,
strong, high connectivity

00:02:06.790 --> 00:02:09.009 align:middle line:84%
between these different
areas of the brain,

00:02:09.009 --> 00:02:12.280 align:middle line:84%
we are accessing more
of our potential,

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:14.250 align:middle line:84%
we're creating more
success in our life,

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:19.180 align:middle line:84%
we're able to perform
at higher peak ability,

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:22.090 align:middle line:84%
but on the reverse, when
we have low connectivity

00:02:22.090 --> 00:02:24.650 align:middle line:84%
between these different
regions of the brain,

00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:28.090 align:middle line:84%
then we tend to get more into
negative traits, like drug

00:02:28.090 --> 00:02:34.070 align:middle line:84%
abuse, or anger issues, or poor
sleep patterns, and so forth.

00:02:34.070 --> 00:02:38.090 align:middle line:84%
So the connectivity within
our brain really matters.

00:02:38.090 --> 00:02:41.950 align:middle line:90%
And we are amazing beings.

00:02:41.950 --> 00:02:43.450 align:middle line:90%
We have so much potential.

00:02:43.450 --> 00:02:49.120 align:middle line:84%
We're only tapping into maybe
3% of our DNA to actively use it

00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:51.160 align:middle line:90%
for awakening our gifts.

00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:53.080 align:middle line:84%
I mean, we have super
immunity within us.

00:02:53.080 --> 00:02:56.710 align:middle line:84%
We have ability to regenerate
limbs within our DNA.

00:02:56.710 --> 00:02:58.900 align:middle line:84%
We have so much
ability within our DNA,

00:02:58.900 --> 00:03:01.390 align:middle line:84%
and yet we're only tapping
into a fraction of it.

00:03:01.390 --> 00:03:04.120 align:middle line:84%
And similarly, with
our brain capacity,

00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:06.880 align:middle line:84%
we may be using 100%
of it, but we're only

00:03:06.880 --> 00:03:09.950 align:middle line:84%
consciously aware of just
that tip of the iceberg.

00:03:09.950 --> 00:03:12.610 align:middle line:84%
And so this is about how
do we get more aware?

00:03:12.610 --> 00:03:16.780 align:middle line:84%
How do we expand our conscious
awareness and conscious use

00:03:16.780 --> 00:03:19.550 align:middle line:90%
of the fullness of who we are?

00:03:19.550 --> 00:03:24.970 align:middle line:84%
And how can we do that now
in a way that is sustainable,

00:03:24.970 --> 00:03:27.080 align:middle line:90%
in a way that is natural?

00:03:27.080 --> 00:03:30.370 align:middle line:84%
You don't need anything really
too much outside of you other

00:03:30.370 --> 00:03:31.220 align:middle line:90%
than the proper--

00:03:31.220 --> 00:03:34.480 align:middle line:84%
there's a proper sensory input,
because our nervous system

00:03:34.480 --> 00:03:39.868 align:middle line:84%
gets wired by our
sensory inputs, but then

00:03:39.868 --> 00:03:42.160 align:middle line:84%
how can we do it in a way
that we're really in control,

00:03:42.160 --> 00:03:47.890 align:middle line:84%
that we really have the ability
to harmonically do this.

00:03:47.890 --> 00:03:50.350 align:middle line:84%
So science calls
it the connectome.

00:03:50.350 --> 00:03:51.790 align:middle line:90%
I like to call them bridges.

00:03:51.790 --> 00:03:55.207 align:middle line:84%
We're going to build different
bridges within the brain,

00:03:55.207 --> 00:03:57.790 align:middle line:84%
and these are going to be tools
that you're going to walk away

00:03:57.790 --> 00:03:58.780 align:middle line:90%
with that you can do.

00:03:58.780 --> 00:04:01.150 align:middle line:84%
Actually, I have a handout
for you at the end.

00:04:01.150 --> 00:04:03.925 align:middle line:90%
It summarizes everything.

00:04:03.925 --> 00:04:05.800 align:middle line:84%
But you're still going
to want to take notes,

00:04:05.800 --> 00:04:07.300 align:middle line:84%
because your handout's
just one page

00:04:07.300 --> 00:04:10.303 align:middle line:84%
versus how much more you're
going to get through this.

00:04:10.303 --> 00:04:12.220 align:middle line:84%
And of course, you can
always go and review it

00:04:12.220 --> 00:04:16.089 align:middle line:84%
on Gaia for those of you
who are subscribed to Gaia.

00:04:16.089 --> 00:04:22.480 align:middle line:84%
So let's start with
ultimately looking at--

00:04:22.480 --> 00:04:25.000 align:middle line:84%
now, here we're at the
Conscious Life Expo, right?

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:29.890 align:middle line:84%
So we're looking at our
spiritual potential,

00:04:29.890 --> 00:04:34.060 align:middle line:84%
and what is going to be
obvious, I think, to you

00:04:34.060 --> 00:04:37.900 align:middle line:84%
by the end is that
science is proving

00:04:37.900 --> 00:04:42.400 align:middle line:84%
how the spiritual
practices work now.

00:04:42.400 --> 00:04:44.740 align:middle line:84%
So these ancient
spiritual practices

00:04:44.740 --> 00:04:46.990 align:middle line:84%
have been around for
thousands of years,

00:04:46.990 --> 00:04:49.750 align:middle line:84%
but now today we can
understand why they

00:04:49.750 --> 00:04:51.190 align:middle line:90%
work from a scientific place.

00:04:51.190 --> 00:04:52.720 align:middle line:84%
So I want to help
weave together all

00:04:52.720 --> 00:04:55.420 align:middle line:84%
the different spiritual
practices and how

00:04:55.420 --> 00:04:57.790 align:middle line:84%
it is that they really
work for us at a very

00:04:57.790 --> 00:05:00.050 align:middle line:90%
physiological level.

00:05:00.050 --> 00:05:05.570 align:middle line:84%
So we're going to start with
a couple of definitions.

00:05:05.570 --> 00:05:06.370 align:middle line:90%
There we go.

00:05:06.370 --> 00:05:08.578 align:middle line:84%
So we're going to start with
a of couple definitions.

00:05:08.578 --> 00:05:11.030 align:middle line:84%
Now, the first thing that
I want to define for you

00:05:11.030 --> 00:05:13.460 align:middle line:90%
are these terms called--

00:05:13.460 --> 00:05:14.630 align:middle line:90%
we have awareness.

00:05:14.630 --> 00:05:16.440 align:middle line:90%
We have consciousness.

00:05:16.440 --> 00:05:17.580 align:middle line:90%
We have the mind.

00:05:17.580 --> 00:05:19.210 align:middle line:90%
We have the brain.

00:05:19.210 --> 00:05:22.220 align:middle line:84%
So science today-- they
often use these terms

00:05:22.220 --> 00:05:23.540 align:middle line:90%
maybe interchangeably.

00:05:23.540 --> 00:05:25.340 align:middle line:84%
They talk about
consciousness and awareness

00:05:25.340 --> 00:05:28.310 align:middle line:84%
as being when you're
awake, and when you're

00:05:28.310 --> 00:05:31.850 align:middle line:84%
in your phase of interacting
with other people in the world,

00:05:31.850 --> 00:05:34.220 align:middle line:90%
and so forth.

00:05:34.220 --> 00:05:36.680 align:middle line:84%
And then they say that--
in traditional science,

00:05:36.680 --> 00:05:39.050 align:middle line:84%
they're saying that
that consciousness is

00:05:39.050 --> 00:05:42.527 align:middle line:84%
a phenomenon of brain
activity, that our brain is

00:05:42.527 --> 00:05:43.610 align:middle line:90%
what brings consciousness.

00:05:43.610 --> 00:05:46.620 align:middle line:90%
Do you agree with that?

00:05:46.620 --> 00:05:48.600 align:middle line:90%
I don't either.

00:05:48.600 --> 00:05:54.110 align:middle line:84%
I believe that our
consciousness is primary.

00:05:54.110 --> 00:05:55.790 align:middle line:84%
In the hermetic
tradition, for example,

00:05:55.790 --> 00:05:57.380 align:middle line:90%
they say the all is mind.

00:05:57.380 --> 00:06:00.980 align:middle line:84%
The universe is mental, that
this universe and everything

00:06:00.980 --> 00:06:03.050 align:middle line:84%
that comes into
physical manifestation

00:06:03.050 --> 00:06:07.490 align:middle line:84%
is ultimately started as an
idea in some universal mind

00:06:07.490 --> 00:06:11.520 align:middle line:84%
and then projected somehow
into this physical density.

00:06:11.520 --> 00:06:14.750 align:middle line:84%
And so we have-- in
the mystery school

00:06:14.750 --> 00:06:17.680 align:middle line:84%
tradition that I work
with, we have a couple

00:06:17.680 --> 00:06:19.430 align:middle line:90%
of different definitions.

00:06:19.430 --> 00:06:22.340 align:middle line:84%
First, we start with
what we call awareness.

00:06:22.340 --> 00:06:27.740 align:middle line:84%
Now, awareness is
that universal field

00:06:27.740 --> 00:06:32.170 align:middle line:84%
of the potential
for consciousness.

00:06:32.170 --> 00:06:35.230 align:middle line:90%
It's like a pure state of being.

00:06:35.230 --> 00:06:36.780 align:middle line:90%
It's eternal.

00:06:36.780 --> 00:06:39.620 align:middle line:90%
It's your original self.

00:06:39.620 --> 00:06:42.410 align:middle line:84%
And there's an awareness,
but it's almost like

00:06:42.410 --> 00:06:44.750 align:middle line:84%
when you're waking
up in the morning.

00:06:44.750 --> 00:06:47.780 align:middle line:84%
Your eyes are closed,
and you're just

00:06:47.780 --> 00:06:50.340 align:middle line:84%
starting to come
into that awareness,

00:06:50.340 --> 00:06:56.540 align:middle line:84%
but all you know is
just I am here, or I am.

00:06:56.540 --> 00:06:59.720 align:middle line:84%
But there's-- your
eyes are closed, right?

00:06:59.720 --> 00:07:03.860 align:middle line:84%
So there's not necessarily this
active observation of what's

00:07:03.860 --> 00:07:05.360 align:middle line:90%
going on outside of you.

00:07:05.360 --> 00:07:07.670 align:middle line:90%
It's self awareness, right?

00:07:07.670 --> 00:07:09.270 align:middle line:90%
So awareness is that.

00:07:09.270 --> 00:07:13.190 align:middle line:84%
It's pure state, and
it's just pure beingness.

00:07:13.190 --> 00:07:14.090 align:middle line:90%
It's oneness.

00:07:14.090 --> 00:07:16.160 align:middle line:90%
There's nothing but you.

00:07:16.160 --> 00:07:17.870 align:middle line:90%
It's all one.

00:07:17.870 --> 00:07:20.660 align:middle line:90%
And then eyes open.

00:07:20.660 --> 00:07:24.260 align:middle line:84%
Eyes open is what we would
define more as consciousness.

00:07:24.260 --> 00:07:31.250 align:middle line:84%
So eyes open means now I see
me, and I see all, right?

00:07:31.250 --> 00:07:34.570 align:middle line:84%
And in seeing all,
I can observe.

00:07:34.570 --> 00:07:37.820 align:middle line:84%
And we know from the
quantum observer effect,

00:07:37.820 --> 00:07:40.290 align:middle line:84%
for example, that
things can come out

00:07:40.290 --> 00:07:43.190 align:middle line:84%
of the quantum field
into physical reality

00:07:43.190 --> 00:07:44.820 align:middle line:90%
through observation.

00:07:44.820 --> 00:07:48.537 align:middle line:84%
So there's this
universal consciousness,

00:07:48.537 --> 00:07:49.870 align:middle line:90%
and there's universal awareness.

00:07:49.870 --> 00:07:54.830 align:middle line:84%
So awareness starts eyes
closed, just pure beingness.

00:07:54.830 --> 00:07:57.920 align:middle line:84%
Eyes open-- universal
consciousness comes in.

00:07:57.920 --> 00:08:01.410 align:middle line:84%
And in that consciousness,
now we can observe.

00:08:01.410 --> 00:08:03.410 align:middle line:90%
We can discern.

00:08:03.410 --> 00:08:06.590 align:middle line:90%
We can identify things.

00:08:06.590 --> 00:08:12.650 align:middle line:84%
We can pursue and make
maybe different judgments

00:08:12.650 --> 00:08:14.240 align:middle line:90%
about those things--

00:08:14.240 --> 00:08:16.310 align:middle line:84%
not judgment from a bad
place, but just judgment,

00:08:16.310 --> 00:08:19.410 align:middle line:84%
discerning different
things from each other.

00:08:19.410 --> 00:08:22.160 align:middle line:90%
So this is a more active state.

00:08:22.160 --> 00:08:24.860 align:middle line:84%
The conscious state is
a more active state,

00:08:24.860 --> 00:08:27.950 align:middle line:84%
and so consciousness is
active, whereas awareness

00:08:27.950 --> 00:08:30.320 align:middle line:90%
is just beingness, right?

00:08:30.320 --> 00:08:31.850 align:middle line:90%
Pure beingness.

00:08:31.850 --> 00:08:35.419 align:middle line:90%
And then we have this sea.

00:08:35.419 --> 00:08:38.580 align:middle line:84%
So everything in the universe
is this sea of consciousness.

00:08:38.580 --> 00:08:40.760 align:middle line:84%
So that consciousness
and that awareness

00:08:40.760 --> 00:08:43.760 align:middle line:84%
that underlies it is
primary, and then everything

00:08:43.760 --> 00:08:46.910 align:middle line:84%
that comes into being
comes out of that, right?

00:08:46.910 --> 00:08:50.850 align:middle line:84%
So forces are set in
motion through though,

00:08:50.850 --> 00:08:54.020 align:middle line:84%
through the act
of observation by

00:08:54.020 --> 00:08:56.540 align:middle line:90%
that universal consciousness.

00:08:56.540 --> 00:09:01.160 align:middle line:84%
And then the other thing that
we have is our brain, right?

00:09:01.160 --> 00:09:02.030 align:middle line:90%
So here we are.

00:09:02.030 --> 00:09:05.840 align:middle line:84%
Now we're going from this
really cosmic nebulous state

00:09:05.840 --> 00:09:08.010 align:middle line:90%
into this very physical state.

00:09:08.010 --> 00:09:12.140 align:middle line:84%
So here we are on this side
of things in the physical,

00:09:12.140 --> 00:09:14.120 align:middle line:84%
where we have our
nervous system.

00:09:14.120 --> 00:09:15.540 align:middle line:90%
We have our brain.

00:09:15.540 --> 00:09:16.400 align:middle line:90%
We have our senses.

00:09:16.400 --> 00:09:22.100 align:middle line:84%
We have all this way that our
body interacts, and the brain--

00:09:22.100 --> 00:09:24.290 align:middle line:84%
again, science--
material science today

00:09:24.290 --> 00:09:26.510 align:middle line:84%
says, OK, well,
consciousness comes

00:09:26.510 --> 00:09:31.610 align:middle line:84%
from epiphenomenon of
the brain, but I see

00:09:31.610 --> 00:09:35.660 align:middle line:90%
the brain more as a receiver.

00:09:35.660 --> 00:09:39.740 align:middle line:84%
It receives transmissions,
kind of like your radio.

00:09:39.740 --> 00:09:43.430 align:middle line:84%
You have a transmitter
and a receiver,

00:09:43.430 --> 00:09:46.140 align:middle line:84%
and there's all these
radio waves in the air.

00:09:46.140 --> 00:09:47.490 align:middle line:90%
We don't see them.

00:09:47.490 --> 00:09:49.130 align:middle line:84%
We don't perceive
them with our senses,

00:09:49.130 --> 00:09:50.698 align:middle line:84%
but they're there
because we know

00:09:50.698 --> 00:09:52.490 align:middle line:84%
that, when we turn on
the radio, it somehow

00:09:52.490 --> 00:09:54.380 align:middle line:90%
picks up those signals, right?

00:09:54.380 --> 00:09:56.170 align:middle line:84%
So your brain is
kind of like that.

00:09:56.170 --> 00:10:00.380 align:middle line:84%
It's receiving the channels,
the stations of consciousness

00:10:00.380 --> 00:10:03.990 align:middle line:84%
that are floating around
in the atmosphere.

00:10:03.990 --> 00:10:06.200 align:middle line:84%
And which channel
you tune into depends

00:10:06.200 --> 00:10:09.680 align:middle line:84%
on how you've set your dial,
what frequencies you are

00:10:09.680 --> 00:10:12.460 align:middle line:90%
operating at within your brain.

00:10:12.460 --> 00:10:14.390 align:middle line:84%
So the brain is--
another way of looking

00:10:14.390 --> 00:10:16.550 align:middle line:90%
at it is like a computer.

00:10:16.550 --> 00:10:18.920 align:middle line:84%
The brain is like
the circuit board.

00:10:18.920 --> 00:10:24.380 align:middle line:84%
It's the infrastructure of
the-- at a tangible level, all

00:10:24.380 --> 00:10:25.700 align:middle line:90%
that circuitry.

00:10:25.700 --> 00:10:27.950 align:middle line:84%
And then you have--
with the computer

00:10:27.950 --> 00:10:31.317 align:middle line:84%
analogy you have your
physical hardware.

00:10:31.317 --> 00:10:32.900 align:middle line:84%
Your nervous system
is a part of that.

00:10:32.900 --> 00:10:34.595 align:middle line:84%
Your body is part
of that, right?

00:10:34.595 --> 00:10:36.140 align:middle line:84%
In a computer, you
have your mouse.

00:10:36.140 --> 00:10:37.360 align:middle line:90%
You have your screen.

00:10:37.360 --> 00:10:38.390 align:middle line:90%
You have your keyboard.

00:10:38.390 --> 00:10:41.910 align:middle line:84%
You have the processing
chip, and so forth.

00:10:41.910 --> 00:10:45.410 align:middle line:84%
But then you also have
the user, and the user

00:10:45.410 --> 00:10:47.150 align:middle line:84%
is that intelligent
being that wants

00:10:47.150 --> 00:10:50.150 align:middle line:84%
to perform certain
functions with that hardware

00:10:50.150 --> 00:10:51.470 align:middle line:90%
or that computer.

00:10:51.470 --> 00:10:52.962 align:middle line:90%
What else do they need?

00:10:52.962 --> 00:10:53.762 align:middle line:90%
>> Software.

00:10:53.762 --> 00:10:55.660 align:middle line:90%
>> [INAUDIBLE]

00:10:55.660 --> 00:10:58.410 align:middle line:84%
>> They need electricity,
and they need software, yes.

00:10:58.410 --> 00:11:01.620 align:middle line:84%
So they need power, and then
they need the software, right?

00:11:01.620 --> 00:11:04.590 align:middle line:84%
They need the interface
that allows the user

00:11:04.590 --> 00:11:07.530 align:middle line:84%
to perform those functions
with that computer,

00:11:07.530 --> 00:11:11.010 align:middle line:84%
and our computers these days are
getting all kinds of magical,

00:11:11.010 --> 00:11:14.430 align:middle line:84%
because they have all kinds of
software programmed into them

00:11:14.430 --> 00:11:18.780 align:middle line:84%
that allow us to do more unique
functions with those computers.

00:11:18.780 --> 00:11:23.170 align:middle line:90%
So what serves as our software?

00:11:23.170 --> 00:11:24.120 align:middle line:90%
>> Cognitions.

00:11:24.120 --> 00:11:26.020 align:middle line:90%
>> Thoughts.

00:11:26.020 --> 00:11:27.372 align:middle line:90%
>> Brain.

00:11:27.372 --> 00:11:28.580 align:middle line:90%
>> The brain is the hardware.

00:11:28.580 --> 00:11:29.015 align:middle line:90%
>> Programming.

00:11:29.015 --> 00:11:29.450 align:middle line:90%
>> Thoughts.

00:11:29.450 --> 00:11:30.320 align:middle line:90%
>> [INAUDIBLE]

00:11:30.320 --> 00:11:31.370 align:middle line:90%
>> What is the programming?

00:11:31.370 --> 00:11:31.865 align:middle line:90%
>> Thoughts.

00:11:31.865 --> 00:11:32.665 align:middle line:90%
>> Perceptions.

00:11:32.665 --> 00:11:36.226 align:middle line:84%
>> Thoughts are coming
from the conscious mind.

00:11:36.226 --> 00:11:38.460 align:middle line:90%
>> [INAUDIBLE]

00:11:38.460 --> 00:11:39.320 align:middle line:90%
>> OK, OK.

00:11:39.320 --> 00:11:40.460 align:middle line:90%
Now we're tapping in.

00:11:40.460 --> 00:11:44.420 align:middle line:84%
So we have what I
would call the--

00:11:44.420 --> 00:11:46.400 align:middle line:90%
our soul.

00:11:46.400 --> 00:11:50.660 align:middle line:84%
So I'm going to call our
consciousness that eternal,

00:11:50.660 --> 00:11:52.030 align:middle line:90%
never ending being.

00:11:52.030 --> 00:11:54.050 align:middle line:90%
It's spirit, right?

00:11:54.050 --> 00:11:57.110 align:middle line:84%
And then in ancient
traditions, almost all

00:11:57.110 --> 00:11:59.870 align:middle line:84%
the ancient traditions
talk about three bodies,

00:11:59.870 --> 00:12:01.100 align:middle line:90%
three vehicles.

00:12:01.100 --> 00:12:03.260 align:middle line:84%
We have the spirit,
which is eternal.

00:12:03.260 --> 00:12:05.720 align:middle line:84%
We have the physical
body, which is mortal.

00:12:05.720 --> 00:12:10.700 align:middle line:84%
And we have the soul, which is
the interface between spirit

00:12:10.700 --> 00:12:11.630 align:middle line:90%
and physical.

00:12:11.630 --> 00:12:13.310 align:middle line:90%
It's like the software.

00:12:13.310 --> 00:12:16.950 align:middle line:84%
So your mind operates
through that soul,

00:12:16.950 --> 00:12:22.755 align:middle line:84%
and it includes both some
level of programming coming

00:12:22.755 --> 00:12:24.630 align:middle line:84%
from the spirit and some
level of programming

00:12:24.630 --> 00:12:26.280 align:middle line:90%
coming from the physical.

00:12:26.280 --> 00:12:29.040 align:middle line:84%
So the things that
we've learned, we can--

00:12:29.040 --> 00:12:31.770 align:middle line:84%
sometimes we call it also our
lower self and our higher self.

00:12:31.770 --> 00:12:33.810 align:middle line:84%
This is all contained
within the soul.

00:12:33.810 --> 00:12:37.050 align:middle line:84%
So the things we've learned in
this world-- our subconscious,

00:12:37.050 --> 00:12:39.750 align:middle line:84%
our negative ego stuff,
our personality stuff,

00:12:39.750 --> 00:12:42.240 align:middle line:90%
our coping strategies, filters--

00:12:42.240 --> 00:12:44.760 align:middle line:84%
all of those are part of
what we call that lower self.

00:12:44.760 --> 00:12:46.710 align:middle line:90%
And that is embedded.

00:12:46.710 --> 00:12:49.920 align:middle line:84%
That is programmed into
that software of the soul.

00:12:49.920 --> 00:12:54.690 align:middle line:84%
And then we have our higher
self, which is more purpose,

00:12:54.690 --> 00:12:56.880 align:middle line:84%
and creative gifts,
and so forth that

00:12:56.880 --> 00:12:59.010 align:middle line:90%
are here to fulfill purpose.

00:12:59.010 --> 00:13:03.360 align:middle line:10%
And that is embedded also
from the spirit into the soul,

00:13:03.360 --> 00:13:04.540 align:middle line:10%
as well.

00:13:04.540 --> 00:13:05.940 align:middle line:90%
So we have these three beings.

00:13:05.940 --> 00:13:10.180 align:middle line:84%
We have the spiritual,
or the consciousness.

00:13:10.180 --> 00:13:13.298 align:middle line:84%
We have the-- an
awareness, which is even

00:13:13.298 --> 00:13:14.340 align:middle line:90%
before the consciousness.

00:13:14.340 --> 00:13:16.150 align:middle line:90%
That's that intelligence.

00:13:16.150 --> 00:13:21.030 align:middle line:84%
And then we have the physical
body, which is the hardware,

00:13:21.030 --> 00:13:24.040 align:middle line:84%
and that's the brain, the
nervous system, and so forth.

00:13:24.040 --> 00:13:26.910 align:middle line:84%
And then we have this interface
between the two, which

00:13:26.910 --> 00:13:32.370 align:middle line:84%
is the mind or the soul that
allows for the programming

00:13:32.370 --> 00:13:33.960 align:middle line:90%
and allows for learning.

00:13:33.960 --> 00:13:36.270 align:middle line:84%
So it's kind of like
a smart operating

00:13:36.270 --> 00:13:39.430 align:middle line:90%
system that learns as it goes.

00:13:39.430 --> 00:13:45.210 align:middle line:84%
And this is-- how we
perceive and process really

00:13:45.210 --> 00:13:47.100 align:middle line:90%
depends on our soul.

00:13:47.100 --> 00:13:49.440 align:middle line:84%
So we have three
levels of being,

00:13:49.440 --> 00:13:53.340 align:middle line:84%
and the consciousness
is pure, right?

00:13:53.340 --> 00:13:55.450 align:middle line:84%
That spirit, that
eternal being is pure.

00:13:55.450 --> 00:13:56.550 align:middle line:90%
I mean, it's infinite.

00:13:56.550 --> 00:13:58.300 align:middle line:90%
It's all knowing and so forth.

00:13:58.300 --> 00:14:00.420 align:middle line:84%
But here we are in this
physical experience,

00:14:00.420 --> 00:14:03.060 align:middle line:84%
and we're not tapping into
nearly that full potential

00:14:03.060 --> 00:14:07.710 align:middle line:84%
that we have within us or
that all knowing, wise being.

00:14:07.710 --> 00:14:10.420 align:middle line:90%
So what's getting in the way?

00:14:10.420 --> 00:14:11.510 align:middle line:90%
What's getting in the way?

00:14:11.510 --> 00:14:14.980 align:middle line:84%
So some of you mentioned,
OK, we have our programming

00:14:14.980 --> 00:14:19.682 align:middle line:84%
from our psychology, from
our life, our physical life.

00:14:19.682 --> 00:14:20.890 align:middle line:90%
And that's part of it, right?

00:14:20.890 --> 00:14:22.180 align:middle line:90%
We have our filters.

00:14:22.180 --> 00:14:23.950 align:middle line:90%
We have our belief systems.

00:14:23.950 --> 00:14:26.680 align:middle line:84%
We have the things
that maybe are

00:14:26.680 --> 00:14:29.620 align:middle line:84%
traumas from the
past that have not

00:14:29.620 --> 00:14:32.800 align:middle line:90%
been properly healed within us.

00:14:32.800 --> 00:14:34.870 align:middle line:84%
And then we have--
on the other side,

00:14:34.870 --> 00:14:38.260 align:middle line:84%
we have our actual
physical wiring, right?

00:14:38.260 --> 00:14:42.230 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes our physical
wiring gets in the way,

00:14:42.230 --> 00:14:45.040 align:middle line:84%
and that's what we
want to address here--

00:14:45.040 --> 00:14:50.920 align:middle line:84%
is how do we rewire, because
fortunately we can rewire.

00:14:50.920 --> 00:14:55.300 align:middle line:84%
Just 20 years ago, maybe,
we had this mindset

00:14:55.300 --> 00:14:58.990 align:middle line:84%
that we were a
slave to our genes,

00:14:58.990 --> 00:15:00.910 align:middle line:84%
that you were-- this is
what you're born with,

00:15:00.910 --> 00:15:02.890 align:middle line:90%
and you just have to accept it.

00:15:02.890 --> 00:15:04.880 align:middle line:84%
And we had this mindset
that we were also

00:15:04.880 --> 00:15:08.410 align:middle line:84%
hardwired by a certain age,
and once you're hardwired,

00:15:08.410 --> 00:15:10.220 align:middle line:90%
there's no changing it.

00:15:10.220 --> 00:15:13.120 align:middle line:84%
But fortunately-- so again,
we were kind of victims

00:15:13.120 --> 00:15:15.220 align:middle line:90%
to our upbringing, right?

00:15:15.220 --> 00:15:18.190 align:middle line:84%
And fortunately, though, we are
learning more and more today

00:15:18.190 --> 00:15:20.650 align:middle line:84%
that we can change
all of it, right?

00:15:20.650 --> 00:15:24.910 align:middle line:84%
We can rewire ourselves
all throughout our life,

00:15:24.910 --> 00:15:27.730 align:middle line:84%
and we are not
slaves to our genes,

00:15:27.730 --> 00:15:30.070 align:middle line:84%
because we have
this epigenome where

00:15:30.070 --> 00:15:34.040 align:middle line:84%
we can shift the switches that
are the layers above the genes,

00:15:34.040 --> 00:15:34.840 align:middle line:90%
right?

00:15:34.840 --> 00:15:37.660 align:middle line:84%
So there's all kinds
of potential for us.

00:15:37.660 --> 00:15:40.630 align:middle line:84%
Now, the very first bridge--
so I talked about bridges,

00:15:40.630 --> 00:15:43.180 align:middle line:84%
and we're going to talk
about seven bridges here.

00:15:43.180 --> 00:15:46.580 align:middle line:84%
And we're going to then
experience a few of them.

00:15:46.580 --> 00:15:48.980 align:middle line:90%
So the first bridge is--

00:15:48.980 --> 00:15:49.780 align:middle line:90%
it is this.

00:15:49.780 --> 00:15:52.060 align:middle line:90%
It is the mind and the soul.

00:15:52.060 --> 00:15:55.180 align:middle line:84%
So that first bridge is
going from the consciousness,

00:15:55.180 --> 00:15:59.770 align:middle line:84%
that eternal intelligence,
that pure awareness

00:15:59.770 --> 00:16:02.890 align:middle line:84%
and consciousness into
this physical body.

00:16:02.890 --> 00:16:04.870 align:middle line:84%
And it is through
the mind and the soul

00:16:04.870 --> 00:16:07.570 align:middle line:84%
that that bridge is
established, right?

00:16:07.570 --> 00:16:10.330 align:middle line:84%
So this is one of those
bridges, and there

00:16:10.330 --> 00:16:13.820 align:middle line:84%
are many spiritual
tools, and philosophies,

00:16:13.820 --> 00:16:17.110 align:middle line:84%
and so forth for
helping us to address--

00:16:17.110 --> 00:16:19.660 align:middle line:90%
psychology also supports that--

00:16:19.660 --> 00:16:21.850 align:middle line:84%
to help us address how
our mind is working,

00:16:21.850 --> 00:16:25.960 align:middle line:84%
and how our soul is working,
and where we get in the way.

00:16:25.960 --> 00:16:30.430 align:middle line:84%
But when it comes to that
mind interfacing with us

00:16:30.430 --> 00:16:33.850 align:middle line:84%
into the body, it
comes in through what

00:16:33.850 --> 00:16:35.910 align:middle line:90%
I would call intention--

00:16:35.910 --> 00:16:37.060 align:middle line:90%
intention.

00:16:37.060 --> 00:16:40.190 align:middle line:84%
So when we have a
certain intention,

00:16:40.190 --> 00:16:44.860 align:middle line:84%
then that sets things in motion,
and that intention is usually

00:16:44.860 --> 00:16:47.200 align:middle line:84%
going to come from
that consciousness,

00:16:47.200 --> 00:16:48.950 align:middle line:90%
from that higher consciousness.

00:16:48.950 --> 00:16:50.762 align:middle line:84%
And so intention
is the first bridge

00:16:50.762 --> 00:16:51.970 align:middle line:90%
that we want to connect with.

00:16:51.970 --> 00:16:54.250 align:middle line:90%
What is the intention?

00:16:54.250 --> 00:16:55.960 align:middle line:84%
And then in addition
to intention

00:16:55.960 --> 00:16:58.150 align:middle line:90%
comes with knowledge, right?

00:16:58.150 --> 00:17:00.340 align:middle line:84%
So knowledge meaning
it's not just

00:17:00.340 --> 00:17:04.060 align:middle line:84%
like I intend for it to be
this way, because we all

00:17:04.060 --> 00:17:06.589 align:middle line:84%
know the power of
intention is very powerful,

00:17:06.589 --> 00:17:09.760 align:middle line:84%
but it's not the whole
story, all right?

00:17:09.760 --> 00:17:11.890 align:middle line:84%
We have to have the
proper knowledge

00:17:11.890 --> 00:17:16.210 align:middle line:84%
of what is even possible,
what tools to be working with,

00:17:16.210 --> 00:17:17.010 align:middle line:90%
right?

00:17:17.010 --> 00:17:18.871 align:middle line:84%
So seeking that
knowledge-- those

00:17:18.871 --> 00:17:20.829 align:middle line:84%
are the things that are
going to really support

00:17:20.829 --> 00:17:26.079 align:middle line:84%
that connection within that
first bridge of the mind.

00:17:26.079 --> 00:17:29.440 align:middle line:84%
And so seeking proper
knowledge, training your mind

00:17:29.440 --> 00:17:31.660 align:middle line:84%
to expand its
possibilities-- because one

00:17:31.660 --> 00:17:34.600 align:middle line:84%
of the big things that limits
us is our belief systems

00:17:34.600 --> 00:17:37.560 align:middle line:90%
of what's possible.

00:17:37.560 --> 00:17:39.810 align:middle line:84%
So by seeking
greater knowledge--

00:17:39.810 --> 00:17:43.440 align:middle line:84%
and I personally have
found a lot of value

00:17:43.440 --> 00:17:46.830 align:middle line:84%
in the deeper
knowledge that we can

00:17:46.830 --> 00:17:49.060 align:middle line:84%
gain from ancient traditions,
because they're tried.

00:17:49.060 --> 00:17:49.860 align:middle line:90%
They're true.

00:17:49.860 --> 00:17:51.120 align:middle line:90%
They've tested it.

00:17:51.120 --> 00:17:54.180 align:middle line:84%
They're fairly
scientific, many of them,

00:17:54.180 --> 00:17:56.280 align:middle line:90%
and it's stood the test of time.

00:17:56.280 --> 00:17:57.510 align:middle line:90%
So a lot of those tools--

00:17:57.510 --> 00:18:01.200 align:middle line:84%
and especially where you see
there's a universal teaching,

00:18:01.200 --> 00:18:03.220 align:middle line:90%
universal principles.

00:18:03.220 --> 00:18:07.480 align:middle line:84%
And so in those universal
principles and teachings

00:18:07.480 --> 00:18:11.400 align:middle line:84%
there's knowledge there that
can be really valuable to us

00:18:11.400 --> 00:18:14.460 align:middle line:84%
to expand our mind, and
you're here at an expo

00:18:14.460 --> 00:18:18.300 align:middle line:84%
seeking knowledge, seeking these
experiences and these tools.

00:18:18.300 --> 00:18:20.760 align:middle line:90%
So this is great.

00:18:20.760 --> 00:18:22.950 align:middle line:84%
And then the second
thing that we

00:18:22.950 --> 00:18:27.200 align:middle line:84%
want to really work with is
looking at our perceptions.

00:18:27.200 --> 00:18:29.130 align:middle line:84%
Now, our perceptions
are going to be filtered

00:18:29.130 --> 00:18:37.450 align:middle line:84%
by both belief systems, as well
as by our sensory sensitivity.

00:18:37.450 --> 00:18:40.390 align:middle line:84%
So we have two things that
affect our perceptions.

00:18:40.390 --> 00:18:43.170 align:middle line:84%
There's the programming
in your mind,

00:18:43.170 --> 00:18:46.290 align:middle line:84%
and that programming you
can reprogram, right?

00:18:46.290 --> 00:18:52.530 align:middle line:84%
We can re-evaluate
our belief systems,

00:18:52.530 --> 00:18:56.310 align:middle line:84%
and we can then
choose consciously

00:18:56.310 --> 00:18:59.110 align:middle line:84%
to re-pattern our
belief systems.

00:18:59.110 --> 00:19:01.335 align:middle line:84%
How many of you
have ever done that?

00:19:01.335 --> 00:19:03.360 align:middle line:84%
It can be challenging
at first, but we just

00:19:03.360 --> 00:19:05.700 align:middle line:84%
keep reminding ourselves,
and we keep seeking,

00:19:05.700 --> 00:19:07.460 align:middle line:90%
and we keep breaking through.

00:19:07.460 --> 00:19:10.290 align:middle line:84%
And we can start to really
have these awakenings

00:19:10.290 --> 00:19:11.580 align:middle line:90%
and these ahas.

00:19:11.580 --> 00:19:16.570 align:middle line:84%
But the second piece is around
our sensory stimulation.

00:19:16.570 --> 00:19:19.560 align:middle line:84%
So what I mean by that is
that each of our senses--

00:19:19.560 --> 00:19:24.450 align:middle line:84%
our sight, our smell, our sense
of taste, touch, hearing--

00:19:24.450 --> 00:19:29.430 align:middle line:84%
all of our senses have a certain
range of what we are taking

00:19:29.430 --> 00:19:31.060 align:middle line:90%
in, what they're--

00:19:31.060 --> 00:19:33.420 align:middle line:84%
you can think of your
body as like a detector,

00:19:33.420 --> 00:19:36.450 align:middle line:84%
and detectors have a certain
range of sensitivity.

00:19:36.450 --> 00:19:39.710 align:middle line:84%
So as that information
comes in, what are we--

00:19:39.710 --> 00:19:41.575 align:middle line:90%
how much of it are we taking in?

00:19:41.575 --> 00:19:43.200 align:middle line:84%
And then not only
how much of it are we

00:19:43.200 --> 00:19:44.992 align:middle line:84%
taking in, how much of
what we're taking in

00:19:44.992 --> 00:19:47.010 align:middle line:90%
are we aware of?

00:19:47.010 --> 00:19:49.890 align:middle line:84%
And this is where I
said before we take in--

00:19:49.890 --> 00:19:53.730 align:middle line:84%
actually, within the range
of sensitivity of our senses,

00:19:53.730 --> 00:19:55.870 align:middle line:90%
we take in 100% of information.

00:19:55.870 --> 00:19:58.860 align:middle line:84%
But a lot of it just goes
straight into the subconscious,

00:19:58.860 --> 00:20:00.300 align:middle line:84%
and the amount
that we're aware of

00:20:00.300 --> 00:20:01.680 align:middle line:90%
is just that tip of the iceberg.

00:20:01.680 --> 00:20:03.670 align:middle line:90%
Some people say 10%.

00:20:03.670 --> 00:20:10.110 align:middle line:84%
So we're aware of 10%, but of
that 10%, just with your eyes,

00:20:10.110 --> 00:20:13.600 align:middle line:84%
for example, the
amount that you see--

00:20:13.600 --> 00:20:15.930 align:middle line:84%
what we call the
visible light spectrum--

00:20:15.930 --> 00:20:20.340 align:middle line:84%
is 1% of the
electromagnetic spectrum.

00:20:20.340 --> 00:20:21.730 align:middle line:90%
We're only seeing 1%.

00:20:21.730 --> 00:20:24.675 align:middle line:90%


00:20:24.675 --> 00:20:27.380 align:middle line:84%
And we're only consciously
aware of maybe 10% of 1%,

00:20:27.380 --> 00:20:30.750 align:middle line:84%
so now we're
talking 0.1%, right?

00:20:30.750 --> 00:20:33.450 align:middle line:84%
And we used to have
this idea in our world

00:20:33.450 --> 00:20:36.540 align:middle line:90%
that seeing is believing.

00:20:36.540 --> 00:20:41.790 align:middle line:84%
But if we're only seeing
0.1% of physical reality,

00:20:41.790 --> 00:20:42.960 align:middle line:90%
that's its physical reality.

00:20:42.960 --> 00:20:45.840 align:middle line:84%
That's not even talking about
the spiritual side of it.

00:20:45.840 --> 00:20:50.520 align:middle line:84%
So we're seeing so little
of our reality around us,

00:20:50.520 --> 00:20:55.350 align:middle line:84%
but we can broaden that range,
so we can start to maybe--

00:20:55.350 --> 00:20:57.330 align:middle line:90%
let's start with perceiving--

00:20:57.330 --> 00:21:01.470 align:middle line:84%
can we get to perceiving 100%
of that 1% of physical reality,

00:21:01.470 --> 00:21:03.270 align:middle line:90%
instead of just 10%, right?

00:21:03.270 --> 00:21:06.210 align:middle line:84%
And then from there, can we
broaden the range from 1%

00:21:06.210 --> 00:21:08.070 align:middle line:84%
and start looking,
and seeing things

00:21:08.070 --> 00:21:11.700 align:middle line:84%
in the X-ray, and UV spectrum,
and into the infrared spectrum.

00:21:11.700 --> 00:21:13.290 align:middle line:90%
Can we broaden that?

00:21:13.290 --> 00:21:15.810 align:middle line:84%
And I believe that people
who are clairvoyant

00:21:15.810 --> 00:21:16.920 align:middle line:90%
are starting to see that.

00:21:16.920 --> 00:21:21.150 align:middle line:84%
They're starting to see maybe
a more subtle range that most

00:21:21.150 --> 00:21:23.820 align:middle line:90%
people it's like it washes out.

00:21:23.820 --> 00:21:27.540 align:middle line:84%
For example, I just saw
an article the other day

00:21:27.540 --> 00:21:30.900 align:middle line:84%
that was really beautiful,
where it's a photographer who

00:21:30.900 --> 00:21:33.420 align:middle line:90%
goes out at night at dark--

00:21:33.420 --> 00:21:34.560 align:middle line:90%
as dark as it can be.

00:21:34.560 --> 00:21:38.760 align:middle line:84%
She goes out at night, and she
takes a UV light out with her.

00:21:38.760 --> 00:21:41.310 align:middle line:84%
And she goes, and she
photographs plants

00:21:41.310 --> 00:21:43.350 align:middle line:90%
under the UV light at night.

00:21:43.350 --> 00:21:46.230 align:middle line:84%
And it is incredible
what happens,

00:21:46.230 --> 00:21:47.910 align:middle line:84%
because they take
take in that UV light,

00:21:47.910 --> 00:21:50.400 align:middle line:84%
and then there's this
phospholuminescence that

00:21:50.400 --> 00:21:52.590 align:middle line:84%
comes out, and there's
these amazing colors

00:21:52.590 --> 00:21:55.950 align:middle line:84%
that these plants glow
under the UV light.

00:21:55.950 --> 00:22:00.060 align:middle line:84%
And she photographs that, and
that is happening all the time.

00:22:00.060 --> 00:22:02.610 align:middle line:84%
So when the sun is
shining during the day,

00:22:02.610 --> 00:22:05.340 align:middle line:84%
there's UV light coming in,
and it-- and these plants

00:22:05.340 --> 00:22:08.640 align:middle line:84%
are coming with these
amazing colors and glows,

00:22:08.640 --> 00:22:12.460 align:middle line:84%
but it's so overwhelmed by the
sunlight that we don't see it,

00:22:12.460 --> 00:22:16.680 align:middle line:84%
but it's there, and yet
we could start to see it.

00:22:16.680 --> 00:22:20.250 align:middle line:84%
So this is where clairvoyance,
that seeing energy--

00:22:20.250 --> 00:22:25.020 align:middle line:84%
and you, your body, you're
emitting light all the time.

00:22:25.020 --> 00:22:26.640 align:middle line:84%
We have something
called biophotons

00:22:26.640 --> 00:22:29.310 align:middle line:90%
that our DNA and cells emit.

00:22:29.310 --> 00:22:33.940 align:middle line:84%
And that bio-- those bio photons
are in the visible range,

00:22:33.940 --> 00:22:36.590 align:middle line:84%
but they're just-- their
amplitude is so low,

00:22:36.590 --> 00:22:38.270 align:middle line:84%
the strength of that
light coming out

00:22:38.270 --> 00:22:41.990 align:middle line:84%
is so subtle that it
just gets washed out,

00:22:41.990 --> 00:22:45.080 align:middle line:84%
and we don't normally pay
attention to the subtleties.

00:22:45.080 --> 00:22:47.390 align:middle line:84%
So one of the other
really big things to do

00:22:47.390 --> 00:22:51.710 align:middle line:84%
is to not assume anything,
because assumption

00:22:51.710 --> 00:22:54.200 align:middle line:90%
is the enemy of perception.

00:22:54.200 --> 00:22:56.190 align:middle line:84%
Assumption is the
enemy of perception.

00:22:56.190 --> 00:22:57.440 align:middle line:90%
So really look.

00:22:57.440 --> 00:23:02.300 align:middle line:84%
Really train yourself to
look, to notice the details,

00:23:02.300 --> 00:23:06.120 align:middle line:84%
to feel and to
really pay attention.

00:23:06.120 --> 00:23:13.290 align:middle line:84%
This is just one example of how
our sensory range is limited,

00:23:13.290 --> 00:23:15.420 align:middle line:90%
and yet can be expanded.

00:23:15.420 --> 00:23:17.360 align:middle line:84%
And this is just
with vision, right?

00:23:17.360 --> 00:23:19.940 align:middle line:84%
We also have what we--
a range of what we feel,

00:23:19.940 --> 00:23:22.790 align:middle line:84%
a range of what we hear, a range
of what we smell and taste.

00:23:22.790 --> 00:23:25.850 align:middle line:84%
And all of these senses
can be exercised,

00:23:25.850 --> 00:23:27.860 align:middle line:90%
and those different senses--

00:23:27.860 --> 00:23:30.510 align:middle line:84%
they feed into your
nervous system.

00:23:30.510 --> 00:23:32.600 align:middle line:84%
They feed it, and
they're charging up

00:23:32.600 --> 00:23:33.470 align:middle line:90%
your nervous system.

00:23:33.470 --> 00:23:35.970 align:middle line:84%
And then that nervous system
communicates that to the brain,

00:23:35.970 --> 00:23:37.650 align:middle line:90%
and it charges up the brain.

00:23:37.650 --> 00:23:40.640 align:middle line:84%
So we're constantly taking
in energy, and stimulus,

00:23:40.640 --> 00:23:42.890 align:middle line:84%
and information from
our environment,

00:23:42.890 --> 00:23:46.640 align:middle line:84%
as well as from our
consciousness, our soul.

00:23:46.640 --> 00:23:49.290 align:middle line:84%
It's coming in through the
spiritual realms, as well.

00:23:49.290 --> 00:23:51.460 align:middle line:84%
So we have all this
energy coming in,

00:23:51.460 --> 00:23:54.800 align:middle line:84%
and one of the
things that I really

00:23:54.800 --> 00:23:56.960 align:middle line:84%
like to encourage
people to become

00:23:56.960 --> 00:23:58.955 align:middle line:84%
is to become more
multi-dimensional--

00:23:58.955 --> 00:24:00.680 align:middle line:90%
to become a multi-dimensional.

00:24:00.680 --> 00:24:02.720 align:middle line:84%
Now, if you can think
of all this stimulus

00:24:02.720 --> 00:24:05.210 align:middle line:84%
that we have coming in
through the physical and all

00:24:05.210 --> 00:24:07.070 align:middle line:84%
this higher guidance,
and insight,

00:24:07.070 --> 00:24:09.140 align:middle line:84%
and wisdom coming
in from that higher

00:24:09.140 --> 00:24:12.710 align:middle line:84%
consciousness, and
that spirit, and we

00:24:12.710 --> 00:24:18.080 align:middle line:84%
have multiple different senses
that we can perceive through--

00:24:18.080 --> 00:24:21.440 align:middle line:84%
in our energy body, we
also have spiritual senses.

00:24:21.440 --> 00:24:24.785 align:middle line:84%
We have magnetic energy,
and we have etheric energy,

00:24:24.785 --> 00:24:26.660 align:middle line:84%
and we have an aura,
and we have the chakras.

00:24:26.660 --> 00:24:28.077 align:middle line:84%
We have all these
different energy

00:24:28.077 --> 00:24:30.650 align:middle line:84%
systems that are kind of
like the nervous system

00:24:30.650 --> 00:24:32.990 align:middle line:90%
to your soul.

00:24:32.990 --> 00:24:34.580 align:middle line:90%
So these are senses, as well.

00:24:34.580 --> 00:24:37.820 align:middle line:84%
They're just different
types of senses.

00:24:37.820 --> 00:24:41.210 align:middle line:84%
If you've ever experienced
where you've been maybe

00:24:41.210 --> 00:24:43.010 align:middle line:84%
in rush hour traffic,
or you've been out

00:24:43.010 --> 00:24:47.690 align:middle line:84%
at the mall or something,
and there's someone who--

00:24:47.690 --> 00:24:48.980 align:middle line:90%
you just get this sense.

00:24:48.980 --> 00:24:49.790 align:middle line:90%
You don't see them.

00:24:49.790 --> 00:24:51.680 align:middle line:84%
You don't hear them or anything,
but you just get the sense.

00:24:51.680 --> 00:24:53.458 align:middle line:84%
And all of a sudden
you look, and you

00:24:53.458 --> 00:24:55.250 align:middle line:84%
see that somebody was
staring right at you.

00:24:55.250 --> 00:24:56.850 align:middle line:84%
Has anyone had that
experience before?

00:24:56.850 --> 00:24:57.650 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:24:57.650 --> 00:25:00.062 align:middle line:84%
So that-- how did
you pick up on that?

00:25:00.062 --> 00:25:02.030 align:middle line:90%
>> Extrasensory perception.

00:25:02.030 --> 00:25:04.050 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, extrasensory
perception.

00:25:04.050 --> 00:25:06.450 align:middle line:84%
I would call that through
your energy field,

00:25:06.450 --> 00:25:10.380 align:middle line:84%
that your aura was feeling their
energy and their intent coming

00:25:10.380 --> 00:25:12.548 align:middle line:84%
through your energy
field to you.

00:25:12.548 --> 00:25:15.090 align:middle line:84%
And you picked up on that, so
that is what we would call more

00:25:15.090 --> 00:25:16.950 align:middle line:90%
your spiritual senses.

00:25:16.950 --> 00:25:22.270 align:middle line:84%
So we have all these different
dimensions of the mind,

00:25:22.270 --> 00:25:25.620 align:middle line:84%
and there is many,
many levels, right?

00:25:25.620 --> 00:25:27.390 align:middle line:84%
And I have an image
of the tree of life

00:25:27.390 --> 00:25:29.580 align:middle line:84%
here on top of
this mind to depict

00:25:29.580 --> 00:25:32.460 align:middle line:84%
that, because in the tradition
that I study in Kabbalah,

00:25:32.460 --> 00:25:34.740 align:middle line:84%
the tree of life shows
us the dimensions

00:25:34.740 --> 00:25:36.690 align:middle line:90%
of the mind and the soul.

00:25:36.690 --> 00:25:39.233 align:middle line:84%
And the bottom-- the very
bottom of the tree of life--

00:25:39.233 --> 00:25:40.650 align:middle line:84%
I don't know if
this has a pointer

00:25:40.650 --> 00:25:43.920 align:middle line:84%
on it-- but at the very
bottom of the tree of life

00:25:43.920 --> 00:25:45.520 align:middle line:90%
is the physical.

00:25:45.520 --> 00:25:49.290 align:middle line:84%
It's like the very, very, very--
there's 1 out of 10 spheres

00:25:49.290 --> 00:25:51.900 align:middle line:84%
on the tree of life is
representing the physical,

00:25:51.900 --> 00:25:53.310 align:middle line:90%
and all the rest of it--

00:25:53.310 --> 00:25:55.410 align:middle line:84%
so there's seven of
them that represent

00:25:55.410 --> 00:25:56.790 align:middle line:90%
the mind and the soul.

00:25:56.790 --> 00:25:59.820 align:middle line:84%
And then there's three of them
that represent the spirit.

00:25:59.820 --> 00:26:02.580 align:middle line:84%
So there's seven
dimensions to the mind,

00:26:02.580 --> 00:26:04.590 align:middle line:84%
and these include things
like subconscious,

00:26:04.590 --> 00:26:08.540 align:middle line:84%
your rational mind, your
intuition, your creativity.

00:26:08.540 --> 00:26:11.580 align:middle line:84%
It includes higher self
and connection to that.

00:26:11.580 --> 00:26:15.120 align:middle line:84%
It includes higher
discernment, and love,

00:26:15.120 --> 00:26:16.290 align:middle line:90%
and sense of altruism.

00:26:16.290 --> 00:26:19.800 align:middle line:84%
There's all these different
dimensions of the mind.

00:26:19.800 --> 00:26:21.930 align:middle line:84%
And all the
dimensions of the mind

00:26:21.930 --> 00:26:24.930 align:middle line:84%
are ultimately about
helping us orient

00:26:24.930 --> 00:26:29.340 align:middle line:84%
our sense of self in relation
to everything else, right?

00:26:29.340 --> 00:26:31.890 align:middle line:84%
Now, our mind-- here's
a nice quote for you.

00:26:31.890 --> 00:26:35.640 align:middle line:10%
Our mind can-- this mental
and emotional framework--

00:26:35.640 --> 00:26:38.670 align:middle line:10%
it can be our ally, and
it can really support us,

00:26:38.670 --> 00:26:41.910 align:middle line:10%
and it can be a vehicle for
transcendence and expanded

00:26:41.910 --> 00:26:45.810 align:middle line:10%
states, but it can also
be our greatest enemy

00:26:45.810 --> 00:26:51.480 align:middle line:10%
that gets in our way, depending
on how we've trained our mind.

00:26:51.480 --> 00:26:54.330 align:middle line:84%
So again, we have all this
huge spiritual potential,

00:26:54.330 --> 00:26:58.080 align:middle line:84%
but if we haven't done the
work to train, and mature,

00:26:58.080 --> 00:27:00.510 align:middle line:84%
and harness the
power of our mind,

00:27:00.510 --> 00:27:03.400 align:middle line:90%
it's likely to not work for us.

00:27:03.400 --> 00:27:06.960 align:middle line:84%
So this is where having
a spiritual practice

00:27:06.960 --> 00:27:08.070 align:middle line:90%
supports, right?

00:27:08.070 --> 00:27:10.680 align:middle line:90%
Learning to meditate supports.

00:27:10.680 --> 00:27:12.450 align:middle line:84%
Learning to harness
your will and what

00:27:12.450 --> 00:27:13.980 align:middle line:90%
you're choosing to focus on--

00:27:13.980 --> 00:27:18.360 align:middle line:84%
these disciplines really support
you in training your mind.

00:27:18.360 --> 00:27:19.260 align:middle line:90%
It's kind of like--

00:27:19.260 --> 00:27:23.940 align:middle line:84%
I like to think of the mind
like a puppy, where you have--

00:27:23.940 --> 00:27:26.630 align:middle line:84%
when you have a puppy,
it's kind of-- it's cute,

00:27:26.630 --> 00:27:28.480 align:middle line:84%
and it's-- but it's
a little unruly.

00:27:28.480 --> 00:27:30.360 align:middle line:90%
It's going to go tear things up.

00:27:30.360 --> 00:27:32.505 align:middle line:84%
It's going to go piss in
whatever corner it wants.

00:27:32.505 --> 00:27:35.220 align:middle line:90%


00:27:35.220 --> 00:27:37.755 align:middle line:10%
You leave it alone for a
little bit, and you come home,

00:27:37.755 --> 00:27:41.380 align:middle line:10%
and you're like, oh my god,
what did you do to my house?

00:27:41.380 --> 00:27:43.830 align:middle line:84%
But when you train
it, and you're

00:27:43.830 --> 00:27:48.900 align:middle line:84%
persistent and consistent,
and positive reinforcement

00:27:48.900 --> 00:27:51.600 align:middle line:84%
obviously is better than
negative reinforcement,

00:27:51.600 --> 00:27:55.740 align:middle line:84%
and you continually work with
it to become your friend,

00:27:55.740 --> 00:27:58.770 align:middle line:84%
now that puppy is
going to be very loyal.

00:27:58.770 --> 00:27:59.953 align:middle line:90%
It's going to support you.

00:27:59.953 --> 00:28:01.620 align:middle line:10%
It's going to give
you the warnings when

00:28:01.620 --> 00:28:02.790 align:middle line:10%
you need the warnings.

00:28:02.790 --> 00:28:05.160 align:middle line:10%
It's going to be
your best friend.

00:28:05.160 --> 00:28:08.700 align:middle line:10%
So your mind is like that,
and we need to train it.

00:28:08.700 --> 00:28:11.730 align:middle line:10%
Now, in the Western
mystery tradition,

00:28:11.730 --> 00:28:15.270 align:middle line:10%
the working with Kabbalah,
working with alchemy,

00:28:15.270 --> 00:28:17.640 align:middle line:10%
working with hermetics
is all about that process

00:28:17.640 --> 00:28:19.470 align:middle line:10%
of training the mind.

00:28:19.470 --> 00:28:21.840 align:middle line:10%
And in the Western
tradition, we actually-- we

00:28:21.840 --> 00:28:25.740 align:middle line:10%
learn to master the mind,
and we go straight into it.

00:28:25.740 --> 00:28:27.960 align:middle line:10%
It's like we look at it
like a scientist would

00:28:27.960 --> 00:28:29.370 align:middle line:10%
look at their experiment.

00:28:29.370 --> 00:28:30.280 align:middle line:10%
How does it work?

00:28:30.280 --> 00:28:31.350 align:middle line:10%
Let's take it apart.

00:28:31.350 --> 00:28:33.357 align:middle line:10%
Let's figure out
each component of it,

00:28:33.357 --> 00:28:35.940 align:middle line:10%
and then let's figure out how
it all works together and put it

00:28:35.940 --> 00:28:39.250 align:middle line:10%
all back into its
proper framework.

00:28:39.250 --> 00:28:44.370 align:middle line:10%
And so in these traditions,
we're going into the mind

00:28:44.370 --> 00:28:46.920 align:middle line:10%
to learn to train
it and master it,

00:28:46.920 --> 00:28:50.250 align:middle line:10%
whereas certain other
traditions goes around the mind.

00:28:50.250 --> 00:28:52.530 align:middle line:10%
It's like, let's just
bypass all that thought

00:28:52.530 --> 00:28:57.370 align:middle line:10%
and go around it so that it
just doesn't get in our way.

00:28:57.370 --> 00:28:58.170 align:middle line:10%
And that's fine.

00:28:58.170 --> 00:29:02.310 align:middle line:10%
You can go around the mind if
you're living in the ashram,

00:29:02.310 --> 00:29:05.520 align:middle line:10%
or if you're in the cave,
or up a mountaintop,

00:29:05.520 --> 00:29:08.250 align:middle line:10%
and you're not dealing with
people and the world, right?

00:29:08.250 --> 00:29:13.870 align:middle line:84%
But if you're in life, in the
world, then we have to engage.

00:29:13.870 --> 00:29:16.120 align:middle line:84%
Our mind is going to be
engaged all the time.

00:29:16.120 --> 00:29:19.530 align:middle line:10%
And so we need to learn to
master it and train it properly

00:29:19.530 --> 00:29:23.020 align:middle line:10%
so that it can work for
us rather than against us,

00:29:23.020 --> 00:29:25.710 align:middle line:10%
and-- but it can become
this amazing vehicle

00:29:25.710 --> 00:29:26.970 align:middle line:10%
for transcendent states.

00:29:26.970 --> 00:29:29.370 align:middle line:10%
And that is what I have
found in the Western mystery

00:29:29.370 --> 00:29:33.210 align:middle line:10%
school tradition-- is through
hermetics, alchemy, Kabbalah,

00:29:33.210 --> 00:29:35.460 align:middle line:10%
working with sacred
geometries, and so forth

00:29:35.460 --> 00:29:40.740 align:middle line:10%
we really learn how to master
and train the mind properly.

00:29:40.740 --> 00:29:44.010 align:middle line:84%
So I mentioned before this
idea of a radio, right?

00:29:44.010 --> 00:29:47.580 align:middle line:84%
So we have these
stations of consciousness

00:29:47.580 --> 00:29:50.840 align:middle line:84%
and thought being broadcast
in this field of--

00:29:50.840 --> 00:29:53.760 align:middle line:84%
or this sea of
consciousness and this field

00:29:53.760 --> 00:29:57.360 align:middle line:84%
of collective consciousness
that we live in.

00:29:57.360 --> 00:30:00.030 align:middle line:84%
And then you also have it
coming in from your spirit.

00:30:00.030 --> 00:30:03.680 align:middle line:84%
And the radio-- how we
turn the dial on the radio

00:30:03.680 --> 00:30:05.660 align:middle line:90%
is through intention.

00:30:05.660 --> 00:30:09.320 align:middle line:84%
So by your will,
by your intention,

00:30:09.320 --> 00:30:12.410 align:middle line:84%
you just choose what
you're going to tune into.

00:30:12.410 --> 00:30:14.195 align:middle line:84%
And you can shift the
dial, and you can--

00:30:14.195 --> 00:30:15.590 align:middle line:90%
it could even be that easy.

00:30:15.590 --> 00:30:20.930 align:middle line:84%
You can imagine, for
example, a thermometer,

00:30:20.930 --> 00:30:22.850 align:middle line:84%
or you could imagine
the radio dial.

00:30:22.850 --> 00:30:26.040 align:middle line:84%
And I'm going to shift now
into this higher frequency.

00:30:26.040 --> 00:30:28.460 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to shift into
this grounding frequency.

00:30:28.460 --> 00:30:30.680 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to shift into
this middle frequency.

00:30:30.680 --> 00:30:32.630 align:middle line:84%
You can just imagine
it like that.

00:30:32.630 --> 00:30:34.770 align:middle line:90%
Do a visualization process.

00:30:34.770 --> 00:30:36.890 align:middle line:84%
And then we have to know,
what are the options

00:30:36.890 --> 00:30:38.090 align:middle line:90%
to tune into, right?

00:30:38.090 --> 00:30:41.270 align:middle line:84%
We have to know what stations
are even available to us.

00:30:41.270 --> 00:30:44.060 align:middle line:84%
And all of this, how
this works in the brain,

00:30:44.060 --> 00:30:47.360 align:middle line:84%
is through what we call
oscillatory energy.

00:30:47.360 --> 00:30:54.470 align:middle line:84%
So your brain has different
neural firings that happen,

00:30:54.470 --> 00:30:57.890 align:middle line:84%
and as different individual
neurons start to fire,

00:30:57.890 --> 00:31:00.410 align:middle line:84%
and then those neurons
start to fire together,

00:31:00.410 --> 00:31:04.610 align:middle line:84%
it creates sort of a
bigger neuronal pattern.

00:31:04.610 --> 00:31:06.260 align:middle line:84%
And then it becomes
a wave, and then

00:31:06.260 --> 00:31:09.620 align:middle line:84%
that wave sweeps from the
local area of neurons,

00:31:09.620 --> 00:31:12.810 align:middle line:84%
and it starts to sweep into
other areas of the brain.

00:31:12.810 --> 00:31:15.980 align:middle line:84%
And we-- in maybe
more common language

00:31:15.980 --> 00:31:18.080 align:middle line:90%
we call this brainwaves, right?

00:31:18.080 --> 00:31:21.020 align:middle line:84%
But these are neural
oscillations or frequencies.

00:31:21.020 --> 00:31:22.640 align:middle line:90%
It's energy.

00:31:22.640 --> 00:31:28.800 align:middle line:84%
And so intention and
knowledge is the first step.

00:31:28.800 --> 00:31:32.460 align:middle line:84%
Now, when we grew up, we grew
up in a very stochastic way,

00:31:32.460 --> 00:31:33.260 align:middle line:90%
right?

00:31:33.260 --> 00:31:34.070 align:middle line:90%
We had chaos.

00:31:34.070 --> 00:31:35.540 align:middle line:90%
We had traumas.

00:31:35.540 --> 00:31:40.670 align:middle line:84%
We had incomplete
experiences and learnings.

00:31:40.670 --> 00:31:43.700 align:middle line:84%
The way our society is
today-- our upbringing,

00:31:43.700 --> 00:31:46.400 align:middle line:84%
our wiring from the
beginning wasn't always

00:31:46.400 --> 00:31:49.610 align:middle line:90%
the most harmonious or balanced.

00:31:49.610 --> 00:31:52.370 align:middle line:84%
And that wiring
starts from the moment

00:31:52.370 --> 00:31:54.440 align:middle line:90%
that we're in utero, right?

00:31:54.440 --> 00:31:56.940 align:middle line:84%
The wiring of the brain
starts from in utero.

00:31:56.940 --> 00:31:58.610 align:middle line:90%
So those energies that were--

00:31:58.610 --> 00:32:01.640 align:middle line:84%
we were exposed to even when
we were in utero affects

00:32:01.640 --> 00:32:02.700 align:middle line:90%
the wiring of the brain.

00:32:02.700 --> 00:32:06.320 align:middle line:84%
Now, fortunately, it can
continue after birth,

00:32:06.320 --> 00:32:09.050 align:middle line:84%
and the wiring of
the brain happens

00:32:09.050 --> 00:32:13.820 align:middle line:84%
through different stages all
the way up until about age 25.

00:32:13.820 --> 00:32:17.150 align:middle line:84%
And at age 25, we
start having what's

00:32:17.150 --> 00:32:19.850 align:middle line:84%
called the myelination,
and the white matter--

00:32:19.850 --> 00:32:20.790 align:middle line:90%
the gray matter.

00:32:20.790 --> 00:32:24.410 align:middle line:84%
So it comes in, and it
starts to hardwire more.

00:32:24.410 --> 00:32:27.350 align:middle line:84%
But we also have something
called neuroplasticity,

00:32:27.350 --> 00:32:29.150 align:middle line:90%
which allows us to rewire.

00:32:29.150 --> 00:32:31.850 align:middle line:84%
But rewiring takes some
effort, because you

00:32:31.850 --> 00:32:35.720 align:middle line:84%
need to put in energy, and
you need to be consistent.

00:32:35.720 --> 00:32:40.110 align:middle line:84%
And of course, there's the
work that Joe Dispenza does,

00:32:40.110 --> 00:32:44.210 align:middle line:84%
for example, which is talking
about the neuroplasticity

00:32:44.210 --> 00:32:45.930 align:middle line:84%
and what fires together,
wires together.

00:32:45.930 --> 00:32:47.870 align:middle line:84%
I mean, this is a
pretty common phrase

00:32:47.870 --> 00:32:50.810 align:middle line:84%
within the whole
neuroscience field.

00:32:50.810 --> 00:32:53.510 align:middle line:84%
What fires together,
wires together.

00:32:53.510 --> 00:32:57.410 align:middle line:84%
So through our behaviors,
through certain sensory inputs,

00:32:57.410 --> 00:33:02.120 align:middle line:84%
we can fire off different
neurons and pieces

00:33:02.120 --> 00:33:03.740 align:middle line:90%
of our nervous system.

00:33:03.740 --> 00:33:09.140 align:middle line:84%
And then if we continue to
use those in a harmonious way,

00:33:09.140 --> 00:33:11.583 align:middle line:84%
we can actually
rewire the brain.

00:33:11.583 --> 00:33:13.500 align:middle line:84%
So what we need to do
is-- there's two things.

00:33:13.500 --> 00:33:15.980 align:middle line:84%
One, we need to
stop the old firing,

00:33:15.980 --> 00:33:17.540 align:middle line:84%
the old patterns
that we don't want.

00:33:17.540 --> 00:33:19.830 align:middle line:84%
You need to-- that's
where our mind comes in.

00:33:19.830 --> 00:33:20.630 align:middle line:90%
Stop.

00:33:20.630 --> 00:33:21.922 align:middle line:90%
That's one of those intentions.

00:33:21.922 --> 00:33:24.200 align:middle line:84%
If you find yourself
in a tailspin,

00:33:24.200 --> 00:33:27.320 align:middle line:90%
stop, and then redirect.

00:33:27.320 --> 00:33:30.110 align:middle line:84%
And start using a
tool, or a practice,

00:33:30.110 --> 00:33:31.850 align:middle line:90%
or some kind of method--

00:33:31.850 --> 00:33:33.230 align:middle line:84%
it could be an
affirmation, but I

00:33:33.230 --> 00:33:36.500 align:middle line:84%
think awakening
the senses really

00:33:36.500 --> 00:33:41.230 align:middle line:84%
supports, because your senses
feed straight into your brain.

00:33:41.230 --> 00:33:45.020 align:middle line:84%
So we want to figure
out ways to rewire

00:33:45.020 --> 00:33:50.840 align:middle line:84%
this nervous system and the
brain patterns to support us,

00:33:50.840 --> 00:33:54.980 align:middle line:84%
to become more harmonious, and
to be more interconnected so

00:33:54.980 --> 00:33:57.020 align:middle line:84%
that we can access
those peak states.

00:33:57.020 --> 00:33:59.690 align:middle line:84%
And we want to do it in
a way that's sustainable,

00:33:59.690 --> 00:34:02.900 align:middle line:84%
meaning you have
control over it and you

00:34:02.900 --> 00:34:04.940 align:middle line:90%
can use it any time of day.

00:34:04.940 --> 00:34:09.409 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't need to be
through some kind of mind

00:34:09.409 --> 00:34:12.260 align:middle line:84%
altering kind of drug
experience or whatnot.

00:34:12.260 --> 00:34:14.239 align:middle line:84%
It's like you can
just-- this is you.

00:34:14.239 --> 00:34:15.760 align:middle line:90%
The power is within you.

00:34:15.760 --> 00:34:18.320 align:middle line:84%
And all the ancient traditions
say that the greatest power

00:34:18.320 --> 00:34:22.489 align:middle line:90%
actually is within us.

00:34:22.489 --> 00:34:26.630 align:middle line:84%
So there's our first
bridge, and then action

00:34:26.630 --> 00:34:28.760 align:middle line:90%
is what's needed to rewire.

00:34:28.760 --> 00:34:31.280 align:middle line:84%
We need to really put
the practices in place.

00:34:31.280 --> 00:34:36.500 align:middle line:84%
And in that brain-body system
through the neuroplasticity,

00:34:36.500 --> 00:34:40.400 align:middle line:84%
we have this ability to adapt
all throughout our life.

00:34:40.400 --> 00:34:42.710 align:middle line:90%
You're never too old to change.

00:34:42.710 --> 00:34:44.630 align:middle line:84%
And so all throughout
our life we

00:34:44.630 --> 00:34:47.989 align:middle line:84%
can use practices that
will intentionally fire

00:34:47.989 --> 00:34:50.370 align:middle line:90%
the brain in a healthy way.

00:34:50.370 --> 00:34:54.020 align:middle line:84%
And so we're going to look at
a couple of different options

00:34:54.020 --> 00:35:00.020 align:middle line:84%
for creating those
neural rewirings,

00:35:00.020 --> 00:35:05.320 align:middle line:84%
and for establishing harmonized
frequencies and brainwave

00:35:05.320 --> 00:35:09.500 align:middle line:84%
patterns, and then tuning it
in to different frequencies.

00:35:09.500 --> 00:35:12.850 align:middle line:84%
So the frequencies that
your brain operates at

00:35:12.850 --> 00:35:17.080 align:middle line:84%
go anywhere from 0 up to about
100 Hertz, or beats per second.

00:35:17.080 --> 00:35:22.930 align:middle line:10%
And the slower the frequencies
tend to be more meditative,

00:35:22.930 --> 00:35:26.900 align:middle line:10%
sleep oriented,
deeper states of--

00:35:26.900 --> 00:35:32.620 align:middle line:10%
away from ego and self
kind of consciousness

00:35:32.620 --> 00:35:35.620 align:middle line:10%
and into just these
more expanded states.

00:35:35.620 --> 00:35:40.260 align:middle line:10%
The higher frequencies tend
to be more about this is me,

00:35:40.260 --> 00:35:42.550 align:middle line:10%
and this is that,
and it's in this sort

00:35:42.550 --> 00:35:45.920 align:middle line:10%
of outwardly focused state.

00:35:45.920 --> 00:35:48.430 align:middle line:10%
So how many of you
are familiar with

00:35:48.430 --> 00:35:51.100 align:middle line:10%
the different brainwave states?

00:35:51.100 --> 00:35:54.400 align:middle line:84%
Most of you have had
some exposure to it.

00:35:54.400 --> 00:35:59.560 align:middle line:84%
The thing about brainwaves is
that you can have brainwaves

00:35:59.560 --> 00:36:02.660 align:middle line:84%
set off, and you can have these
neural oscillations happening,

00:36:02.660 --> 00:36:07.210 align:middle line:84%
but if they are not given
an ongoing external source,

00:36:07.210 --> 00:36:09.980 align:middle line:90%
they'll dissipate.

00:36:09.980 --> 00:36:13.270 align:middle line:10%
So something might trigger it,
but if that external source--

00:36:13.270 --> 00:36:14.740 align:middle line:10%
or it could be an
internal source,

00:36:14.740 --> 00:36:17.080 align:middle line:10%
meaning you doing
something-- but if it

00:36:17.080 --> 00:36:19.840 align:middle line:10%
isn't continuing to
be exposed to that,

00:36:19.840 --> 00:36:20.950 align:middle line:10%
then the waves dissipate.

00:36:20.950 --> 00:36:23.140 align:middle line:90%
And that's just friction.

00:36:23.140 --> 00:36:25.930 align:middle line:84%
That's just what happens
within our physical world--

00:36:25.930 --> 00:36:29.060 align:middle line:84%
is the energies will
kind of fade off.

00:36:29.060 --> 00:36:33.670 align:middle line:84%
So what we want to do for
sustained brainwave entrainment

00:36:33.670 --> 00:36:39.340 align:middle line:84%
is to continue to introduce a
harmonious source that gives it

00:36:39.340 --> 00:36:40.960 align:middle line:90%
that rhythmic push.

00:36:40.960 --> 00:36:41.980 align:middle line:90%
It's like a swing.

00:36:41.980 --> 00:36:44.110 align:middle line:10%
If you're pushing
a child on a swing,

00:36:44.110 --> 00:36:45.640 align:middle line:10%
and you just give
him one big push,

00:36:45.640 --> 00:36:46.810 align:middle line:10%
they're going to
swing back and forth,

00:36:46.810 --> 00:36:48.768 align:middle line:10%
and then they're going
to come to a standstill.

00:36:48.768 --> 00:36:50.920 align:middle line:84%
But if you just keep
pushing in the right rhythm,

00:36:50.920 --> 00:36:54.730 align:middle line:84%
then it keeps on swinging,
and the fun continues.

00:36:54.730 --> 00:37:00.320 align:middle line:84%
So we want to work with
this concept of entrainment.

00:37:00.320 --> 00:37:02.290 align:middle line:10%
So really briefly,
entrainment means

00:37:02.290 --> 00:37:05.320 align:middle line:10%
that different systems
that have the ability

00:37:05.320 --> 00:37:09.190 align:middle line:10%
to oscillate, or
resonate, vibrate

00:37:09.190 --> 00:37:10.900 align:middle line:10%
at different frequencies--

00:37:10.900 --> 00:37:14.560 align:middle line:10%
if you-- for example, if
you strike a tuning fork,

00:37:14.560 --> 00:37:17.320 align:middle line:10%
and you bring it to within
a certain physical range,

00:37:17.320 --> 00:37:22.060 align:middle line:10%
physical proximity of
another vibrating system that

00:37:22.060 --> 00:37:25.390 align:middle line:10%
has the ability to vibrate
at the same frequency,

00:37:25.390 --> 00:37:28.330 align:middle line:10%
they will start to
vibrate together.

00:37:28.330 --> 00:37:30.010 align:middle line:10%
They will entrain.

00:37:30.010 --> 00:37:33.665 align:middle line:10%
And so this entrainment is
a thing that we can use.

00:37:33.665 --> 00:37:35.290 align:middle line:10%
It's very well known
in science, and we

00:37:35.290 --> 00:37:40.010 align:middle line:10%
can use it to stimulate the
brain into those expanded

00:37:40.010 --> 00:37:40.810 align:middle line:10%
states.

00:37:40.810 --> 00:37:43.516 align:middle line:90%


00:37:43.516 --> 00:37:47.125 align:middle line:84%
There's a whole new technology,
or field of technology--

00:37:47.125 --> 00:37:49.210 align:middle line:90%
it's called neurotechnology--

00:37:49.210 --> 00:37:50.890 align:middle line:90%
that's all about that.

00:37:50.890 --> 00:37:54.910 align:middle line:84%
How do we stimulate the
brain through sound?

00:37:54.910 --> 00:37:58.340 align:middle line:84%
How do we stimulate the
brain through light frequency

00:37:58.340 --> 00:37:59.140 align:middle line:90%
patterns?

00:37:59.140 --> 00:38:02.680 align:middle line:84%
How do we stimulate the brain
through vibration patterns

00:38:02.680 --> 00:38:06.670 align:middle line:84%
like physical
vibrations, smells?

00:38:06.670 --> 00:38:08.920 align:middle line:84%
So all of these
neurotechnologies

00:38:08.920 --> 00:38:13.180 align:middle line:84%
that are trying to hack
the brain in certain ways

00:38:13.180 --> 00:38:15.520 align:middle line:84%
to achieve those
expanded states--

00:38:15.520 --> 00:38:17.620 align:middle line:84%
those are what we
call neurotechnology.

00:38:17.620 --> 00:38:21.220 align:middle line:84%
Now, there's also
the power within.

00:38:21.220 --> 00:38:28.690 align:middle line:10%
You can use, for example,
breath work, meditation, chants,

00:38:28.690 --> 00:38:35.020 align:middle line:10%
Your own voice for the
chanting, but in a rhythmic way.

00:38:35.020 --> 00:38:38.975 align:middle line:10%
Rituals, qigong and tai chi.

00:38:38.975 --> 00:38:40.600 align:middle line:10%
All of these things
are things that you

00:38:40.600 --> 00:38:42.132 align:middle line:10%
can generate within
yourself that

00:38:42.132 --> 00:38:44.590 align:middle line:10%
create what we would call--
well, in the ancient tradition,

00:38:44.590 --> 00:38:47.980 align:middle line:10%
we'd call it internal
alchemy, inner alchemy,

00:38:47.980 --> 00:38:50.860 align:middle line:10%
where your body actually
becomes this alchemical factory.

00:38:50.860 --> 00:38:53.060 align:middle line:10%
And it works with
the endocrine system.

00:38:53.060 --> 00:38:55.210 align:middle line:10%
It works with the energy field.

00:38:55.210 --> 00:38:57.110 align:middle line:10%
It works with the
nervous system.

00:38:57.110 --> 00:38:59.570 align:middle line:10%
And it will stimulate the brain.

00:38:59.570 --> 00:39:01.630 align:middle line:10%
So all of these
spiritual practices--

00:39:01.630 --> 00:39:03.490 align:middle line:10%
I call them tools for life.

00:39:03.490 --> 00:39:07.780 align:middle line:10%
Yes, we have our sort of modern
technological ways of hacking

00:39:07.780 --> 00:39:10.330 align:middle line:10%
our body, but these
ancient spiritual practices

00:39:10.330 --> 00:39:13.030 align:middle line:10%
were very sustainable
ways of accomplishing

00:39:13.030 --> 00:39:16.400 align:middle line:10%
these neural systems.

00:39:16.400 --> 00:39:19.240 align:middle line:84%
Now let's get into how
the brain develops,

00:39:19.240 --> 00:39:24.670 align:middle line:84%
because this is where some of
what I keyed in on is unique.

00:39:24.670 --> 00:39:26.830 align:middle line:84%
So I had this vision
at one point of,

00:39:26.830 --> 00:39:29.770 align:middle line:84%
how do we really
reprogram the brain?

00:39:29.770 --> 00:39:37.000 align:middle line:84%
Because in our conscious
mind, our intentional state--

00:39:37.000 --> 00:39:40.930 align:middle line:84%
it works from what we call
the prefrontal cortex.

00:39:40.930 --> 00:39:43.990 align:middle line:84%
And the prefrontal cortex is the
most human part of the brain.

00:39:43.990 --> 00:39:46.190 align:middle line:84%
It sits right here
behind your head.

00:39:46.190 --> 00:39:49.870 align:middle line:84%
It's about 35% of
your brain mass

00:39:49.870 --> 00:39:52.750 align:middle line:84%
is in the prefrontal cortex,
but it's the most human part

00:39:52.750 --> 00:39:53.810 align:middle line:90%
of the brain.

00:39:53.810 --> 00:39:57.450 align:middle line:84%
And that is where we have what
we call our executive function,

00:39:57.450 --> 00:39:59.950 align:middle line:84%
our executive-- our
ability to choose,

00:39:59.950 --> 00:40:03.180 align:middle line:84%
to discern, to be abstract,
to set intentions,

00:40:03.180 --> 00:40:05.520 align:middle line:84%
to be goal oriented,
and so forth.

00:40:05.520 --> 00:40:09.420 align:middle line:84%
And so from our choices
today, how can we

00:40:09.420 --> 00:40:11.500 align:middle line:90%
then rewire the brain?

00:40:11.500 --> 00:40:13.530 align:middle line:84%
And I had this
realization as I was

00:40:13.530 --> 00:40:15.760 align:middle line:84%
studying the brain
that the brain develops

00:40:15.760 --> 00:40:16.560 align:middle line:90%
in a certain way.

00:40:16.560 --> 00:40:21.420 align:middle line:84%
It develops in the--
from the fetus,

00:40:21.420 --> 00:40:26.910 align:middle line:84%
it develops from the bottom up,
so from the deep brain stem up.

00:40:26.910 --> 00:40:30.750 align:middle line:84%
It grows like a tree, and then
from the back to the front.

00:40:30.750 --> 00:40:33.810 align:middle line:84%
So the brain develops
bottom up, back to front.

00:40:33.810 --> 00:40:38.310 align:middle line:84%
And as we grew up,
we were programmed

00:40:38.310 --> 00:40:39.590 align:middle line:90%
with that development, right?

00:40:39.590 --> 00:40:41.670 align:middle line:84%
So our foundation is
in the brain stem,

00:40:41.670 --> 00:40:44.220 align:middle line:84%
and then it grew up from
there and forward from there.

00:40:44.220 --> 00:40:46.920 align:middle line:84%
And those correlate
with different phases

00:40:46.920 --> 00:40:49.170 align:middle line:90%
of our life, different ages.

00:40:49.170 --> 00:40:51.960 align:middle line:84%
For example, we
have our late 20s--

00:40:51.960 --> 00:40:54.210 align:middle line:84%
or early 20s is when
our prefrontal cortex

00:40:54.210 --> 00:40:55.860 align:middle line:90%
most developed.

00:40:55.860 --> 00:40:59.010 align:middle line:84%
And then you have your
cortex in the teens,

00:40:59.010 --> 00:41:02.610 align:middle line:84%
and you have your limbic
system in your pre-teens.

00:41:02.610 --> 00:41:03.600 align:middle line:90%
Those are fun times.

00:41:03.600 --> 00:41:05.160 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:41:05.160 --> 00:41:08.280 align:middle line:84%
And then in your
childhood and in infancy,

00:41:08.280 --> 00:41:11.123 align:middle line:84%
you have the old brain
and the brain stem.

00:41:11.123 --> 00:41:12.540 align:middle line:84%
So depending on
what was happening

00:41:12.540 --> 00:41:14.550 align:middle line:84%
during those times
in your life, that

00:41:14.550 --> 00:41:18.460 align:middle line:84%
determined the wiring and the
foundations of your brain.

00:41:18.460 --> 00:41:20.550 align:middle line:84%
So if we want to
rewire the brain,

00:41:20.550 --> 00:41:22.380 align:middle line:84%
we need to work in
the reverse order.

00:41:22.380 --> 00:41:25.410 align:middle line:84%
We need to work from where we
have conscious control-- so

00:41:25.410 --> 00:41:29.040 align:middle line:84%
from the prefrontal
cortex, front to the back,

00:41:29.040 --> 00:41:31.570 align:middle line:90%
and then from the top down.

00:41:31.570 --> 00:41:34.530 align:middle line:84%
So we're going to trace our
way through that sequence,

00:41:34.530 --> 00:41:37.230 align:middle line:84%
from the front to the back,
and then the top down.

00:41:37.230 --> 00:41:39.540 align:middle line:90%
And this will then--

00:41:39.540 --> 00:41:41.970 align:middle line:84%
as we do this, we're
going to figure out

00:41:41.970 --> 00:41:44.130 align:middle line:84%
which are the tools
that we can use

00:41:44.130 --> 00:41:47.040 align:middle line:84%
to support the different
areas of the brain.

00:41:47.040 --> 00:41:51.660 align:middle line:84%
So prefrontal cortex--
as I just mentioned, is--

00:41:51.660 --> 00:41:53.230 align:middle line:90%
you can see here.

00:41:53.230 --> 00:41:56.500 align:middle line:84%
It's the most executive
part of the brain.

00:41:56.500 --> 00:41:58.110 align:middle line:84%
They call it the
executive center,

00:41:58.110 --> 00:42:00.230 align:middle line:90%
and it's that front most part.

00:42:00.230 --> 00:42:04.680 align:middle line:84%
And the whole just
tapping on your head

00:42:04.680 --> 00:42:08.850 align:middle line:84%
is going to stimulate
your prefrontal cortex.

00:42:08.850 --> 00:42:12.630 align:middle line:84%
It's what is most
distinguishes humans.

00:42:12.630 --> 00:42:16.380 align:middle line:90%
Our prefrontal cortex is--

00:42:16.380 --> 00:42:21.330 align:middle line:84%
I think it's like twice the
size of the lesser apes and five

00:42:21.330 --> 00:42:24.360 align:middle line:84%
times the size of dogs,
of the canine species.

00:42:24.360 --> 00:42:27.390 align:middle line:84%
So we have much more
executive control,

00:42:27.390 --> 00:42:31.500 align:middle line:84%
and here is where intention,
deliberate orchestration

00:42:31.500 --> 00:42:35.040 align:middle line:84%
of our activities of
the day, goal setting--

00:42:35.040 --> 00:42:37.510 align:middle line:84%
all of these types of
things happen here.

00:42:37.510 --> 00:42:39.380 align:middle line:84%
And the prefrontal
cortex actually

00:42:39.380 --> 00:42:42.510 align:middle line:84%
is growing and
developing from birth

00:42:42.510 --> 00:42:45.210 align:middle line:84%
all the way up
until 25 years old.

00:42:45.210 --> 00:42:48.150 align:middle line:84%
And what it does-- what's unique
about the prefrontal cortex

00:42:48.150 --> 00:42:52.320 align:middle line:84%
is that it hooks in to all
the other areas of the brain

00:42:52.320 --> 00:42:54.420 align:middle line:90%
so that it can control them.

00:42:54.420 --> 00:42:57.330 align:middle line:84%
So what makes us most
human is our ability

00:42:57.330 --> 00:42:59.610 align:middle line:90%
to have this executive function.

00:42:59.610 --> 00:43:03.990 align:middle line:84%
What makes us most animal is
when we get into survival mode,

00:43:03.990 --> 00:43:08.350 align:middle line:84%
and our old brain hijacks
our prefrontal cortex.

00:43:08.350 --> 00:43:11.460 align:middle line:84%
So when we-- we just
go into reaction mode,

00:43:11.460 --> 00:43:14.400 align:middle line:84%
and we don't have as much
control-- self control.

00:43:14.400 --> 00:43:17.840 align:middle line:84%
And even though we think we
should be rational, we can't.

00:43:17.840 --> 00:43:19.590 align:middle line:84%
That is when our deeper
parts of our brain

00:43:19.590 --> 00:43:22.030 align:middle line:84%
are hijacking our
prefrontal cortex.

00:43:22.030 --> 00:43:26.440 align:middle line:84%
So we want to be able to
maintain executive function.

00:43:26.440 --> 00:43:30.090 align:middle line:84%
So that means we need to
reconnect from the prefrontal

00:43:30.090 --> 00:43:32.350 align:middle line:90%
down and back.

00:43:32.350 --> 00:43:38.910 align:middle line:84%
And in the Taoist tradition,
the whole brain area

00:43:38.910 --> 00:43:42.180 align:middle line:84%
would be called what they
say is the upper dantian.

00:43:42.180 --> 00:43:46.830 align:middle line:84%
Dantian is like energy centers,
really important energy centers

00:43:46.830 --> 00:43:49.980 align:middle line:90%
that we want to develop.

00:43:49.980 --> 00:43:55.290 align:middle line:84%
So when it comes to working
the prefrontal cortex, first

00:43:55.290 --> 00:43:58.920 align:middle line:84%
of all, we need to remember
we have right hemisphere

00:43:58.920 --> 00:44:00.600 align:middle line:90%
and left hemisphere.

00:44:00.600 --> 00:44:02.240 align:middle line:84%
Right hemisphere
and left hemisphere

00:44:02.240 --> 00:44:05.310 align:middle line:90%
are all about balancing, right?

00:44:05.310 --> 00:44:09.540 align:middle line:84%
So most people are either right
brain dominant or left brain

00:44:09.540 --> 00:44:10.830 align:middle line:90%
dominant.

00:44:10.830 --> 00:44:12.395 align:middle line:84%
They tend to either
be more creative.

00:44:12.395 --> 00:44:13.770 align:middle line:84%
If they're right
brain, they tend

00:44:13.770 --> 00:44:18.600 align:middle line:84%
to be more creative, more
intuitive, more nonlinear, more

00:44:18.600 --> 00:44:21.950 align:middle line:84%
emotional, maybe, but
very much in the capacity

00:44:21.950 --> 00:44:23.400 align:middle line:90%
for relationships.

00:44:23.400 --> 00:44:25.202 align:middle line:84%
And they learn through
those dynamics.

00:44:25.202 --> 00:44:26.910 align:middle line:84%
And then you have your
left brain people,

00:44:26.910 --> 00:44:30.990 align:middle line:84%
who are more analytical,
logical, language and numbers

00:44:30.990 --> 00:44:32.760 align:middle line:90%
oriented, and so forth.

00:44:32.760 --> 00:44:35.800 align:middle line:90%


00:44:35.800 --> 00:44:39.490 align:middle line:84%
So the idea-- the
ideal, I should say,

00:44:39.490 --> 00:44:41.490 align:middle line:84%
is not to be right brain
or left brain dominant,

00:44:41.490 --> 00:44:45.990 align:middle line:84%
but to be whole brain,
to have equal access

00:44:45.990 --> 00:44:50.380 align:middle line:84%
to both left and right,
and really the whole brain.

00:44:50.380 --> 00:44:52.890 align:middle line:84%
So we want to learn
how to balance, right?

00:44:52.890 --> 00:44:55.980 align:middle line:84%
So I'm going to call this second
bridge, the balance bridge.

00:44:55.980 --> 00:44:57.630 align:middle line:90%
And this second bridge--

00:44:57.630 --> 00:45:01.290 align:middle line:84%
it actually is a physical bridge
right between the hemispheres.

00:45:01.290 --> 00:45:03.930 align:middle line:84%
It is what we call
the prefrontal chiasma

00:45:03.930 --> 00:45:05.820 align:middle line:90%
and the corpus callosum.

00:45:05.820 --> 00:45:09.750 align:middle line:84%
And so that's the connectivity
between the hemispheres.

00:45:09.750 --> 00:45:12.510 align:middle line:90%


00:45:12.510 --> 00:45:15.090 align:middle line:84%
Scientists have studied
Einstein's brain quite a bit

00:45:15.090 --> 00:45:17.950 align:middle line:84%
to try and figure out what
was so special about him

00:45:17.950 --> 00:45:19.120 align:middle line:90%
and his brain.

00:45:19.120 --> 00:45:21.060 align:middle line:84%
And one of the things
that they found

00:45:21.060 --> 00:45:26.160 align:middle line:84%
was that he had a really
thick corpus callosum.

00:45:26.160 --> 00:45:31.020 align:middle line:84%
The connectivity between the two
hemispheres was really thick.

00:45:31.020 --> 00:45:34.710 align:middle line:84%
He also had a much
larger prefrontal cortex

00:45:34.710 --> 00:45:36.370 align:middle line:90%
than most people.

00:45:36.370 --> 00:45:39.240 align:middle line:84%
So these were just
one little example

00:45:39.240 --> 00:45:42.780 align:middle line:84%
of how we want to
really develop this.

00:45:42.780 --> 00:45:47.160 align:middle line:84%
Now, prefrontal cortex
really has a good connection

00:45:47.160 --> 00:45:52.680 align:middle line:84%
to the gamma range of
brainwaves, which is anywhere

00:45:52.680 --> 00:45:55.470 align:middle line:90%
from about 30 up to 100 Hertz.

00:45:55.470 --> 00:45:59.070 align:middle line:84%
And so when you're
listening to gamma

00:45:59.070 --> 00:46:02.820 align:middle line:84%
frequency range, binaural
beats, isochronic,

00:46:02.820 --> 00:46:05.890 align:middle line:84%
that kind of brainwave
entrainment technology--

00:46:05.890 --> 00:46:09.420 align:middle line:84%
do you know how brainwaves
work, like the binaural beat

00:46:09.420 --> 00:46:10.710 align:middle line:90%
technology works?

00:46:10.710 --> 00:46:11.896 align:middle line:90%
Who does not know?

00:46:11.896 --> 00:46:13.200 align:middle line:90%
Just-- OK.

00:46:13.200 --> 00:46:16.320 align:middle line:84%
So the idea between
binaural beats

00:46:16.320 --> 00:46:19.410 align:middle line:84%
is that you put one frequency
in one year with headphones

00:46:19.410 --> 00:46:21.600 align:middle line:84%
and another frequency
in the other ear.

00:46:21.600 --> 00:46:22.680 align:middle line:90%
They're different.

00:46:22.680 --> 00:46:26.460 align:middle line:84%
So your right brain says,
oh, I'm hearing 500 Hertz,

00:46:26.460 --> 00:46:30.030 align:middle line:84%
and your left brain says,
no, we're hearing 510 Hertz.

00:46:30.030 --> 00:46:31.680 align:middle line:84%
And they're going
back and forth,

00:46:31.680 --> 00:46:32.970 align:middle line:84%
and back and forth,
and back and forth.

00:46:32.970 --> 00:46:34.512 align:middle line:84%
And over the corpus
callosum, they're

00:46:34.512 --> 00:46:37.260 align:middle line:84%
trying to find agreement, but
they can't find agreement.

00:46:37.260 --> 00:46:41.700 align:middle line:84%
So what happens inside the
brain is an interference signal

00:46:41.700 --> 00:46:42.610 align:middle line:90%
between the two.

00:46:42.610 --> 00:46:44.550 align:middle line:84%
So it's the
difference of the two.

00:46:44.550 --> 00:46:48.630 align:middle line:84%
So it would come up with
a 10 Hertz beat that

00:46:48.630 --> 00:46:50.310 align:middle line:90%
is not coming from the outside.

00:46:50.310 --> 00:46:52.300 align:middle line:90%
It's your brain is producing it.

00:46:52.300 --> 00:46:54.030 align:middle line:84%
So it's forcing
the two hemispheres

00:46:54.030 --> 00:46:56.940 align:middle line:84%
to talk to each
other, and then it's

00:46:56.940 --> 00:46:59.040 align:middle line:84%
forcing them to find
agreement with each other.

00:46:59.040 --> 00:47:02.840 align:middle line:84%
And as soon as they find that
difference between the two,

00:47:02.840 --> 00:47:05.340 align:middle line:84%
that 10 Hertz beat, or whatever
it is that you're turning it

00:47:05.340 --> 00:47:08.760 align:middle line:84%
into, that then sweeps
across the brain,

00:47:08.760 --> 00:47:12.460 align:middle line:84%
and it harmonizes everything
into that frequency pattern.

00:47:12.460 --> 00:47:15.180 align:middle line:84%
So this is how binaural beat
brainwave entrainment works.

00:47:15.180 --> 00:47:16.920 align:middle line:90%
And they also have isochronic.

00:47:16.920 --> 00:47:19.020 align:middle line:84%
Isochronic is where
it sounds like it's

00:47:19.020 --> 00:47:22.830 align:middle line:84%
sweeping back and forth,
and then it kind of creates

00:47:22.830 --> 00:47:23.923 align:middle line:90%
an entrainment that way.

00:47:23.923 --> 00:47:25.590 align:middle line:84%
And then there's
monochronic, so there's

00:47:25.590 --> 00:47:29.040 align:middle line:84%
different ways of doing--
using sound to create

00:47:29.040 --> 00:47:30.940 align:middle line:90%
brainwave entrainment.

00:47:30.940 --> 00:47:36.450 align:middle line:84%
And so in the gamma range,
anywhere from 30 to 100 Hertz,

00:47:36.450 --> 00:47:38.650 align:middle line:90%
but there's in particular--

00:47:38.650 --> 00:47:43.465 align:middle line:84%
there is this 40 Hertz peak
in the gamma frequency.

00:47:43.465 --> 00:47:47.070 align:middle line:84%
And that 40 Hertz peak is
observed to synchronize

00:47:47.070 --> 00:47:51.120 align:middle line:84%
the whole brain in a
very holistic fashion.

00:47:51.120 --> 00:47:53.370 align:middle line:90%
And not only that, it's sweeps--

00:47:53.370 --> 00:47:57.570 align:middle line:84%
so it comes actually up from the
thalamus, and the hypothalamus,

00:47:57.570 --> 00:47:58.883 align:middle line:90%
and hippocampus area.

00:47:58.883 --> 00:48:00.300 align:middle line:84%
So it comes from
the deeper brain.

00:48:00.300 --> 00:48:02.280 align:middle line:84%
It sweeps up to the
prefrontal cortex,

00:48:02.280 --> 00:48:03.870 align:middle line:90%
and then sweeps back down.

00:48:03.870 --> 00:48:06.630 align:middle line:84%
And it even goes down, and
it unifies into the heart,

00:48:06.630 --> 00:48:07.630 align:middle line:90%
as well.

00:48:07.630 --> 00:48:10.710 align:middle line:84%
So this gamma frequency
of around 40 Hertz tuning

00:48:10.710 --> 00:48:14.820 align:middle line:84%
is a really important whole
brain neural synchronization

00:48:14.820 --> 00:48:18.480 align:middle line:84%
pattern that we
want to work with,

00:48:18.480 --> 00:48:20.280 align:middle line:84%
and I believe it
really will support us

00:48:20.280 --> 00:48:27.120 align:middle line:84%
with balancing and wiring
up that corpus callosum

00:48:27.120 --> 00:48:28.770 align:middle line:90%
and that prefrontal.

00:48:28.770 --> 00:48:30.045 align:middle line:90%
Now the rest of the cortex--

00:48:30.045 --> 00:48:35.940 align:middle line:90%


00:48:35.940 --> 00:48:40.890 align:middle line:84%
so you can see the prefrontal
is kind of right before the ears

00:48:40.890 --> 00:48:43.410 align:middle line:84%
and then forward,
but then you have

00:48:43.410 --> 00:48:46.110 align:middle line:84%
the rest of the cortex,
which goes back from there.

00:48:46.110 --> 00:48:50.190 align:middle line:84%
The cortex is going to be the
upper ranges of the brain.

00:48:50.190 --> 00:48:52.720 align:middle line:84%
Again, you have the right
and left hemispheres.

00:48:52.720 --> 00:48:54.960 align:middle line:84%
So the rest of the
cortex tends to operate

00:48:54.960 --> 00:48:59.190 align:middle line:84%
at the beta frequency
range, anywhere from I

00:48:59.190 --> 00:49:01.380 align:middle line:90%
think it's 13 to 30 Hertz.

00:49:01.380 --> 00:49:06.060 align:middle line:84%
And when it comes to
stimulating these--

00:49:06.060 --> 00:49:07.830 align:middle line:84%
we're going to do
an exercise here.

00:49:07.830 --> 00:49:09.900 align:middle line:84%
When it comes to
stimulating these,

00:49:09.900 --> 00:49:12.840 align:middle line:84%
your prefrontals really
are very active when

00:49:12.840 --> 00:49:14.670 align:middle line:90%
your eyes are open--

00:49:14.670 --> 00:49:19.200 align:middle line:90%
so visual cues-- visual cues.

00:49:19.200 --> 00:49:23.820 align:middle line:84%
And then also when your eyes
are closed, and you're in REM

00:49:23.820 --> 00:49:25.210 align:middle line:90%
sleep--

00:49:25.210 --> 00:49:27.090 align:middle line:84%
so when your eyes
are really active,

00:49:27.090 --> 00:49:29.610 align:middle line:84%
but there's inner
visual cues happening.

00:49:29.610 --> 00:49:32.220 align:middle line:84%
So when there's REM,
and then also we

00:49:32.220 --> 00:49:36.093 align:middle line:90%
can stimulate through tapping.

00:49:36.093 --> 00:49:38.010 align:middle line:84%
You could tap either
right above the eyebrows,

00:49:38.010 --> 00:49:41.320 align:middle line:84%
or you could tap right in the
hairline, right above the eyes.

00:49:41.320 --> 00:49:43.860 align:middle line:84%
So kind of in line
with your pupils.

00:49:43.860 --> 00:49:46.080 align:middle line:90%
You can do tapping here.

00:49:46.080 --> 00:49:52.390 align:middle line:84%
So we're going to do a
bit of an exercise here,

00:49:52.390 --> 00:49:55.350 align:middle line:84%
and I am playing music that
has gamma-beta frequencies

00:49:55.350 --> 00:49:56.680 align:middle line:90%
behind it, just so you know.

00:49:56.680 --> 00:50:01.810 align:middle line:84%
It's called "Illuminations" by
J.S. Epperson and the Monroe

00:50:01.810 --> 00:50:03.970 align:middle line:90%
Institute.

00:50:03.970 --> 00:50:10.000 align:middle line:84%
So just take a moment, and look
at this with your eyes open.

00:50:10.000 --> 00:50:15.340 align:middle line:84%
Look at the center of
the Fibonacci spiral.

00:50:15.340 --> 00:50:18.820 align:middle line:84%
Just find whichever one is
easier for you to look at.

00:50:18.820 --> 00:50:21.450 align:middle line:84%
And with your eyes
open, you're going

00:50:21.450 --> 00:50:24.840 align:middle line:90%
to take your left index finger.

00:50:24.840 --> 00:50:27.640 align:middle line:84%
We're going to be doing a
little bit of brain gym here.

00:50:27.640 --> 00:50:31.090 align:middle line:84%
Take your left index finger
to your right prefrontal,

00:50:31.090 --> 00:50:35.610 align:middle line:84%
maybe right in the hairline
there or above the eyebrow,

00:50:35.610 --> 00:50:36.410 align:middle line:90%
all right?

00:50:36.410 --> 00:50:37.570 align:middle line:84%
And you're just
going to tap, and you

00:50:37.570 --> 00:50:38.950 align:middle line:90%
want to tap kind of fast.

00:50:38.950 --> 00:50:41.360 align:middle line:84%
And just breathe while
you're looking at the image.

00:50:41.360 --> 00:50:58.583 align:middle line:90%


00:50:58.583 --> 00:50:59.750 align:middle line:90%
Now let's try the other one.

00:50:59.750 --> 00:51:03.140 align:middle line:90%
So right hand, left prefrontal.

00:51:03.140 --> 00:51:07.070 align:middle line:90%


00:51:07.070 --> 00:51:12.470 align:middle line:84%
Try to get it right above your
eye, right above the pupil,

00:51:12.470 --> 00:51:14.510 align:middle line:84%
either just at the eyebrow
or in the hairline.

00:51:14.510 --> 00:51:18.965 align:middle line:90%


00:51:18.965 --> 00:51:20.840 align:middle line:90%
Breathe and look at the image.

00:51:20.840 --> 00:51:31.020 align:middle line:90%


00:51:31.020 --> 00:51:32.890 align:middle line:90%
Now, you don't need to do this.

00:51:32.890 --> 00:51:33.690 align:middle line:90%
You can do this.

00:51:33.690 --> 00:51:36.260 align:middle line:90%


00:51:36.260 --> 00:51:40.027 align:middle line:84%
Again, looking at the image,
both together, so you're

00:51:40.027 --> 00:51:41.610 align:middle line:84%
kind of tapping them
at the same time.

00:51:41.610 --> 00:51:45.960 align:middle line:90%


00:51:45.960 --> 00:51:46.760 align:middle line:90%
And breathe.

00:51:46.760 --> 00:51:54.160 align:middle line:90%


00:51:54.160 --> 00:51:57.137 align:middle line:84%
And now tap just right
on your third eye.

00:51:57.137 --> 00:51:58.720 align:middle line:84%
Right there is the
prefrontal chiasma.

00:51:58.720 --> 00:52:03.530 align:middle line:90%


00:52:03.530 --> 00:52:04.330 align:middle line:90%
And breathe.

00:52:04.330 --> 00:52:17.350 align:middle line:90%


00:52:17.350 --> 00:52:18.150 align:middle line:90%
What do you feel?

00:52:18.150 --> 00:52:20.640 align:middle line:90%


00:52:20.640 --> 00:52:21.440 align:middle line:90%
>> Really vibrant.

00:52:21.440 --> 00:52:22.380 align:middle line:90%
>> Relaxed.

00:52:22.380 --> 00:52:23.250 align:middle line:90%
>> Vibrant.

00:52:23.250 --> 00:52:24.050 align:middle line:90%
Relaxed.

00:52:24.050 --> 00:52:27.200 align:middle line:90%


00:52:27.200 --> 00:52:29.580 align:middle line:90%
>> I saw the waves move.

00:52:29.580 --> 00:52:31.010 align:middle line:90%
>> You saw the waves move?

00:52:31.010 --> 00:52:32.390 align:middle line:90%
So you saw the image moving?

00:52:32.390 --> 00:52:35.930 align:middle line:84%
>> I thought I saw
it like -- do a spin.

00:52:35.930 --> 00:52:37.270 align:middle line:90%
>> Your brain did a little--

00:52:37.270 --> 00:52:38.420 align:middle line:90%
a little loop de loopery.

00:52:38.420 --> 00:52:42.830 align:middle line:90%


00:52:42.830 --> 00:52:46.480 align:middle line:84%
>> Can you feel a little buzzing
in your prefrontal cortex?

00:52:46.480 --> 00:52:47.890 align:middle line:90%
It feels good, right?

00:52:47.890 --> 00:52:48.770 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:52:48.770 --> 00:52:50.540 align:middle line:90%
>> Simple, yeah?

00:52:50.540 --> 00:52:54.080 align:middle line:84%
So this is just tapping,
breathing, looking at an image.

00:52:54.080 --> 00:52:56.000 align:middle line:84%
You could use any
image, but make it

00:52:56.000 --> 00:52:59.180 align:middle line:90%
imagery that is colorful.

00:52:59.180 --> 00:53:03.170 align:middle line:90%
Mandalas are great for that.

00:53:03.170 --> 00:53:05.520 align:middle line:84%
Sacred geometry
is great for that.

00:53:05.520 --> 00:53:07.940 align:middle line:84%
You want it to be a harmonic
image, though, right?

00:53:07.940 --> 00:53:10.940 align:middle line:90%
So you're looking for balance.

00:53:10.940 --> 00:53:14.210 align:middle line:84%
So usually those images should
be symmetric in some way.

00:53:14.210 --> 00:53:15.800 align:middle line:84%
This one's not
exactly symmetric,

00:53:15.800 --> 00:53:20.090 align:middle line:84%
but it was cool, but some kind
of sacred geometry, or mandala.

00:53:20.090 --> 00:53:24.530 align:middle line:84%
Very symmetric, very harmonic,
and yet a lot to look at.

00:53:24.530 --> 00:53:26.480 align:middle line:90%
Very stimulating.

00:53:26.480 --> 00:53:28.170 align:middle line:84%
And then the tapping
and the breathing.

00:53:28.170 --> 00:53:31.880 align:middle line:84%
And the reason we
do left to right

00:53:31.880 --> 00:53:33.855 align:middle line:84%
is because your right
hemisphere controls

00:53:33.855 --> 00:53:35.480 align:middle line:84%
the left side of your
body, so I wanted

00:53:35.480 --> 00:53:39.340 align:middle line:84%
to just stimulate one hemisphere
at a time at first, right?

00:53:39.340 --> 00:53:40.210 align:middle line:90%
So same thing.

00:53:40.210 --> 00:53:42.650 align:middle line:84%
We're cross laterally
wired, and then

00:53:42.650 --> 00:53:45.570 align:middle line:84%
when we're doing it
together, it's similar.

00:53:45.570 --> 00:53:49.560 align:middle line:84%
And then just the middle, which
is the bridge between them.

00:53:49.560 --> 00:53:51.260 align:middle line:84%
So this is just
an example of how

00:53:51.260 --> 00:53:53.580 align:middle line:90%
we're going to keep working.

00:53:53.580 --> 00:53:56.780 align:middle line:84%
So now we're going to come
to the temporal lobes.

00:53:56.780 --> 00:53:59.000 align:middle line:84%
So we're going to go through
the rest of the cortex,

00:53:59.000 --> 00:54:02.360 align:middle line:84%
and, again, the cortex is
all about balancing the two

00:54:02.360 --> 00:54:03.950 align:middle line:90%
hemispheres.

00:54:03.950 --> 00:54:07.850 align:middle line:84%
Now, your temporal lobes
are sitting kind of right

00:54:07.850 --> 00:54:11.630 align:middle line:84%
around the ears, and
we're going to work

00:54:11.630 --> 00:54:15.230 align:middle line:84%
with another bridge here called
the rewire and refocus bridge.

00:54:15.230 --> 00:54:17.677 align:middle line:84%
So as we go away from
the prefrontal cortex

00:54:17.677 --> 00:54:19.760 align:middle line:84%
into the rest of the brain,
we're still balancing,

00:54:19.760 --> 00:54:23.000 align:middle line:84%
but we're rewiring
and refocusing.

00:54:23.000 --> 00:54:26.060 align:middle line:84%
So there's connective circuits
between the prefrontal cortex

00:54:26.060 --> 00:54:28.790 align:middle line:84%
and the temporals, between the
prefrontal cortex and the--

00:54:28.790 --> 00:54:31.010 align:middle line:84%
what we call the
parietals, and then back

00:54:31.010 --> 00:54:32.600 align:middle line:90%
to the occipital lobes.

00:54:32.600 --> 00:54:36.770 align:middle line:84%
And so here, with
the temporal lobes,

00:54:36.770 --> 00:54:39.020 align:middle line:84%
what do you think might be
the sensory input that most

00:54:39.020 --> 00:54:40.230 align:middle line:90%
stimulates them?

00:54:40.230 --> 00:54:41.030 align:middle line:90%
>> Sound.

00:54:41.030 --> 00:54:42.020 align:middle line:90%
>> Sound, right?

00:54:42.020 --> 00:54:44.620 align:middle line:84%
Because they're
right by our ears.

00:54:44.620 --> 00:54:47.480 align:middle line:84%
So the temporals are
processing sound.

00:54:47.480 --> 00:54:53.550 align:middle line:84%
And what's pretty amazing
now, that sound can be words.

00:54:53.550 --> 00:55:00.740 align:middle line:84%
It can be non-sensical, meaning
just sound-- just grunts,

00:55:00.740 --> 00:55:05.750 align:middle line:84%
and moans, and things like that,
any kind of social interaction,

00:55:05.750 --> 00:55:09.660 align:middle line:84%
because people are social, and
they communicate through sound.

00:55:09.660 --> 00:55:12.710 align:middle line:84%
So a lot of our social
interactions and relationships

00:55:12.710 --> 00:55:18.240 align:middle line:84%
are going to be wired in through
the pre-- the temporal lobes.

00:55:18.240 --> 00:55:21.500 align:middle line:84%
So with your
temporal lobes, the--

00:55:21.500 --> 00:55:24.710 align:middle line:84%
it'd be better to do
a beta frequency here,

00:55:24.710 --> 00:55:28.080 align:middle line:84%
but we're going to now
do a tapping again.

00:55:28.080 --> 00:55:29.180 align:middle line:90%
This is a little bit--

00:55:29.180 --> 00:55:31.400 align:middle line:84%
but we're also going
to do a toning.

00:55:31.400 --> 00:55:38.180 align:middle line:84%
So the tapping point is right
above the tops of the ear.

00:55:38.180 --> 00:55:40.997 align:middle line:84%
Actually, you could do
right on the temples.

00:55:40.997 --> 00:55:42.080 align:middle line:90%
Let's do the temples here.

00:55:42.080 --> 00:55:45.350 align:middle line:84%
So the temple-- and it's
right in the hairline again.

00:55:45.350 --> 00:55:49.770 align:middle line:84%
So first of all, again, we're
going to do the similar thing.

00:55:49.770 --> 00:55:51.530 align:middle line:84%
So take your left,
and we're going

00:55:51.530 --> 00:55:55.610 align:middle line:84%
to tap the right temple
right in the hairline,

00:55:55.610 --> 00:55:59.205 align:middle line:90%
and we're going to tone ah.

00:55:59.205 --> 00:56:00.005 align:middle line:90%
Ah.

00:56:00.005 --> 00:56:12.890 align:middle line:90%


00:56:12.890 --> 00:56:15.980 align:middle line:84%
When you're tapping, it's kind
of from the corner of the eye

00:56:15.980 --> 00:56:17.090 align:middle line:90%
right into the hairline.

00:56:17.090 --> 00:56:18.838 align:middle line:90%
Let's do it again.

00:56:18.838 --> 00:56:19.638 align:middle line:90%
Ah.

00:56:19.638 --> 00:56:32.040 align:middle line:90%


00:56:32.040 --> 00:56:34.700 align:middle line:90%
Do the other one.

00:56:34.700 --> 00:56:36.530 align:middle line:90%
And now we're going to town oh.

00:56:36.530 --> 00:56:37.330 align:middle line:90%
Oh.

00:56:37.330 --> 00:56:50.930 align:middle line:90%


00:56:50.930 --> 00:56:52.690 align:middle line:90%
One more time.

00:56:52.690 --> 00:56:53.490 align:middle line:90%
Oh.

00:56:53.490 --> 00:57:03.887 align:middle line:90%


00:57:03.887 --> 00:57:08.605 align:middle line:84%
Now tap together, and
we're going to tone mm.

00:57:08.605 --> 00:57:09.405 align:middle line:90%
Mm.

00:57:09.405 --> 00:57:22.030 align:middle line:90%


00:57:22.030 --> 00:57:23.872 align:middle line:90%
One more time.

00:57:23.872 --> 00:57:24.672 align:middle line:90%
Mm.

00:57:24.672 --> 00:57:34.815 align:middle line:90%


00:57:34.815 --> 00:57:37.120 align:middle line:84%
Now we're going to
put it all together.

00:57:37.120 --> 00:57:37.920 align:middle line:90%
Ah.

00:57:37.920 --> 00:57:46.063 align:middle line:90%


00:57:46.063 --> 00:57:46.863 align:middle line:90%
Oh.

00:57:46.863 --> 00:57:53.662 align:middle line:90%


00:57:53.662 --> 00:57:54.462 align:middle line:90%
Mm.

00:57:54.462 --> 00:57:59.830 align:middle line:90%


00:57:59.830 --> 00:58:03.280 align:middle line:84%
I know I'm making you do a
little bit of brain gym here.

00:58:03.280 --> 00:58:05.680 align:middle line:90%
Now tap-- tap the--

00:58:05.680 --> 00:58:13.674 align:middle line:84%
so from your temples
up to the top, aum.

00:58:13.674 --> 00:58:22.940 align:middle line:90%


00:58:22.940 --> 00:58:24.650 align:middle line:90%
One more time.

00:58:24.650 --> 00:58:25.450 align:middle line:90%
Aum.

00:58:25.450 --> 00:58:36.390 align:middle line:90%


00:58:36.390 --> 00:58:37.420 align:middle line:90%
Notice how you feel.

00:58:37.420 --> 00:58:38.220 align:middle line:90%
Just take a scan.

00:58:38.220 --> 00:58:44.633 align:middle line:90%


00:58:44.633 --> 00:58:46.644 align:middle line:90%
How was that?

00:58:46.644 --> 00:58:48.120 align:middle line:90%
>> Lighter.

00:58:48.120 --> 00:58:50.700 align:middle line:84%
>> Different from
prefrontal, right?

00:58:50.700 --> 00:58:54.990 align:middle line:90%
You can feel it now all in here.

00:58:54.990 --> 00:58:57.300 align:middle line:90%
So another tool.

00:58:57.300 --> 00:58:59.100 align:middle line:84%
You can work from
one to the next.

00:58:59.100 --> 00:59:01.142 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to start powering
through some of this.

00:59:01.142 --> 00:59:05.700 align:middle line:84%
So your ear is an
amazing instrument.

00:59:05.700 --> 00:59:08.910 align:middle line:84%
Your ear is an amazing tool
for bringing in energy.

00:59:08.910 --> 00:59:12.360 align:middle line:84%
Your ear is fully
developed in utero--

00:59:12.360 --> 00:59:13.330 align:middle line:90%
in utero.

00:59:13.330 --> 00:59:15.510 align:middle line:84%
And so it's one of the
first sensory organs

00:59:15.510 --> 00:59:21.900 align:middle line:84%
to come board for a developing
baby, and so they can hear.

00:59:21.900 --> 00:59:24.330 align:middle line:84%
They're taking in
energy and information

00:59:24.330 --> 00:59:27.540 align:middle line:84%
from the environment,
and the first thing

00:59:27.540 --> 00:59:34.170 align:middle line:84%
that the baby's brain entrains
to is the mother's heartbeat.

00:59:34.170 --> 00:59:35.550 align:middle line:90%
And that's through the ear.

00:59:35.550 --> 00:59:39.160 align:middle line:84%
So the heartbeat is
entraining the ear,

00:59:39.160 --> 00:59:42.820 align:middle line:84%
which then feeds into the
brain and entrains the brain.

00:59:42.820 --> 00:59:46.540 align:middle line:84%
And so the fetus is
developing first with this--

00:59:46.540 --> 00:59:51.390 align:middle line:84%
the heartbeat tends to be at
a delta range of frequencies.

00:59:51.390 --> 00:59:56.960 align:middle line:84%
And your ear is never
shut-- it never shuts down.

00:59:56.960 --> 00:59:58.800 align:middle line:84%
Your eyes will close
when you go to sleep,

00:59:58.800 --> 01:00:00.510 align:middle line:90%
but your ears never do.

01:00:00.510 --> 01:00:03.060 align:middle line:84%
And they're constantly taking
in information and energy,

01:00:03.060 --> 01:00:06.030 align:middle line:84%
unless you put in ear
plugs, which mutes that.

01:00:06.030 --> 01:00:08.760 align:middle line:84%
But they're constantly
working and charging up,

01:00:08.760 --> 01:00:12.780 align:middle line:84%
and that your ear has
three more times--

01:00:12.780 --> 01:00:16.680 align:middle line:84%
three times more connections
to the brain than your eyes do.

01:00:16.680 --> 01:00:20.160 align:middle line:84%
So the ears have a lot more
influence on your brain,

01:00:20.160 --> 01:00:21.930 align:middle line:90%
actually, than what you see.

01:00:21.930 --> 01:00:24.090 align:middle line:84%
And not only that,
but from the ears,

01:00:24.090 --> 01:00:26.340 align:middle line:84%
that auditory nerve
feeds directly

01:00:26.340 --> 01:00:28.540 align:middle line:90%
into every organ of your body.

01:00:28.540 --> 01:00:30.870 align:middle line:84%
So what you're hearing
is feeding directly

01:00:30.870 --> 01:00:33.630 align:middle line:90%
into every organ in your body.

01:00:33.630 --> 01:00:36.126 align:middle line:84%
So do you think it's
important what we listen to?

01:00:36.126 --> 01:00:38.210 align:middle line:90%
Uh-huh.

01:00:38.210 --> 01:00:39.010 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

01:00:39.010 --> 01:00:40.540 align:middle line:90%
>> [INAUDIBLE]

01:00:40.540 --> 01:00:43.110 align:middle line:90%
>> Well, not a lot of things.

01:00:43.110 --> 01:00:45.540 align:middle line:84%
So again, you want to
bring in harmonious sound.

01:00:45.540 --> 01:00:48.570 align:middle line:84%
So as much as you can
be surrounding yourself

01:00:48.570 --> 01:00:51.750 align:middle line:84%
with harmonious
sounds, the better.

01:00:51.750 --> 01:00:56.730 align:middle line:84%
When you're out in traffic, put
on some really classical music

01:00:56.730 --> 01:00:58.650 align:middle line:84%
or something that's
really settling,

01:00:58.650 --> 01:01:05.220 align:middle line:84%
rather than the heavy
metal or hip hop.

01:01:05.220 --> 01:01:08.508 align:middle line:84%
And I mean, they're fun,
but put on stuff that's

01:01:08.508 --> 01:01:10.550 align:middle line:84%
going to be-- because when
you're out in traffic,

01:01:10.550 --> 01:01:13.353 align:middle line:84%
it's chaotic enough, so you
want to do something that's

01:01:13.353 --> 01:01:14.520 align:middle line:90%
going to help calm you down.

01:01:14.520 --> 01:01:16.320 align:middle line:84%
And when you come
home from your day,

01:01:16.320 --> 01:01:18.870 align:middle line:84%
put on, again, some kind
of music that's harmonious.

01:01:18.870 --> 01:01:22.920 align:middle line:84%
It can be upbeat but
make it more world--

01:01:22.920 --> 01:01:24.540 align:middle line:90%
and just really harm--

01:01:24.540 --> 01:01:27.030 align:middle line:90%
rhythmic and harmonious.

01:01:27.030 --> 01:01:29.220 align:middle line:84%
And when you put in
music with lyrics,

01:01:29.220 --> 01:01:31.980 align:middle line:84%
it's going to stimulate
left hemisphere more so

01:01:31.980 --> 01:01:33.330 align:middle line:90%
than right hemisphere.

01:01:33.330 --> 01:01:35.160 align:middle line:84%
So when you have
music without lyrics,

01:01:35.160 --> 01:01:37.410 align:middle line:84%
then it's equally
stimulating both,

01:01:37.410 --> 01:01:39.450 align:middle line:84%
hemispheres because
your language

01:01:39.450 --> 01:01:45.290 align:middle line:84%
centers that process words
are in the left hemisphere.

01:01:45.290 --> 01:01:48.630 align:middle line:90%
So this is one thing--

01:01:48.630 --> 01:01:51.360 align:middle line:84%
and then the power of the
ear-- in auricular therapy,

01:01:51.360 --> 01:01:53.010 align:middle line:84%
where it's acupuncture
for the ear,

01:01:53.010 --> 01:01:56.050 align:middle line:84%
they say that ear looks
like an inverted fetus.

01:01:56.050 --> 01:01:57.840 align:middle line:84%
So they can treat
the whole body just

01:01:57.840 --> 01:02:02.010 align:middle line:84%
from different acupressure and
puncture points on the ear.

01:02:02.010 --> 01:02:04.710 align:middle line:84%
So your ear is like a little
microcosm for your macrocosm

01:02:04.710 --> 01:02:06.920 align:middle line:90%
of your body.

01:02:06.920 --> 01:02:09.060 align:middle line:84%
Hemispheric
entrainment-- so there's

01:02:09.060 --> 01:02:12.530 align:middle line:84%
many ways that our brain
can become entrained,

01:02:12.530 --> 01:02:14.550 align:middle line:84%
and there's something
called biomusicology,

01:02:14.550 --> 01:02:18.180 align:middle line:84%
which is to synchronize
the rhythms of the body

01:02:18.180 --> 01:02:20.430 align:middle line:90%
into an external sound.

01:02:20.430 --> 01:02:24.900 align:middle line:84%
So for example, a drum
beat, or a didgeridoo,

01:02:24.900 --> 01:02:29.880 align:middle line:84%
or those types of ancient
shamanic gongs, and chimes,

01:02:29.880 --> 01:02:31.930 align:middle line:84%
and all of those
types of things.

01:02:31.930 --> 01:02:35.857 align:middle line:84%
So sound healing has been very
well known for a long time,

01:02:35.857 --> 01:02:37.440 align:middle line:84%
and then now we
have-- and I explained

01:02:37.440 --> 01:02:39.523 align:middle line:84%
the biannual beat and
brainwave entrainment method

01:02:39.523 --> 01:02:41.500 align:middle line:90%
to you just a few moments ago.

01:02:41.500 --> 01:02:43.980 align:middle line:84%
So we also have now
the neurotechnologies.

01:02:43.980 --> 01:02:45.990 align:middle line:84%
Now, music without
lyrics that's harmonious

01:02:45.990 --> 01:02:49.410 align:middle line:84%
automatically harmonizes
left and right hemisphere

01:02:49.410 --> 01:02:50.400 align:middle line:90%
of the brain.

01:02:50.400 --> 01:02:53.335 align:middle line:84%
So any kind of harmonious
music without lyrics

01:02:53.335 --> 01:02:55.710 align:middle line:84%
is going to automatically put
you into a more whole brain

01:02:55.710 --> 01:02:59.850 align:middle line:84%
state, but then if you want
to specifically entrain

01:02:59.850 --> 01:03:01.710 align:middle line:84%
into certain frequency
levels, then you

01:03:01.710 --> 01:03:05.550 align:middle line:84%
need to introduce the right
type of frequency patterns

01:03:05.550 --> 01:03:07.980 align:middle line:90%
for the brain to entrain to.

01:03:07.980 --> 01:03:10.620 align:middle line:84%
So now we're going to shift
to the parietal lobes.

01:03:10.620 --> 01:03:14.790 align:middle line:84%
Now, the parietal lobes are sort
of where the top of the head

01:03:14.790 --> 01:03:18.940 align:middle line:84%
curves over to the back, and
the parietal lobes really--

01:03:18.940 --> 01:03:21.090 align:middle line:84%
they're, again,
part of the cortex.

01:03:21.090 --> 01:03:23.970 align:middle line:84%
They have a lot to do with
our sense of orientation

01:03:23.970 --> 01:03:28.320 align:middle line:84%
and perception of space, so
the sense of space around us

01:03:28.320 --> 01:03:30.840 align:middle line:84%
and our orientation
within space.

01:03:30.840 --> 01:03:33.990 align:middle line:84%
And when the parietal
circuit actually

01:03:33.990 --> 01:03:40.560 align:middle line:84%
goes into a harmonized
activity or a minimal activity

01:03:40.560 --> 01:03:43.290 align:middle line:84%
is when people tend to be
in that meditation state,

01:03:43.290 --> 01:03:46.820 align:middle line:84%
and they lose a sense
of space and time.

01:03:46.820 --> 01:03:49.420 align:middle line:84%
So as we shift to
the parietal lobes,

01:03:49.420 --> 01:03:52.640 align:middle line:84%
we're now starting to shift
from the outer to the inner,

01:03:52.640 --> 01:03:53.440 align:middle line:90%
all right?

01:03:53.440 --> 01:03:54.610 align:middle line:84%
So we want to
now-- this is where

01:03:54.610 --> 01:03:55.818 align:middle line:90%
I call it the refocus bridge.

01:03:55.818 --> 01:03:57.670 align:middle line:84%
We want to shift
from outer to inner.

01:03:57.670 --> 01:04:04.450 align:middle line:84%
So we're going to refocus
towards ourselves, and it's--

01:04:04.450 --> 01:04:06.940 align:middle line:84%
a lot of that has to do
with closing your eyes.

01:04:06.940 --> 01:04:10.150 align:middle line:84%
So we're going to start
minimizing the outer stimulus,

01:04:10.150 --> 01:04:15.430 align:middle line:84%
closing the eyes, and we
can still do some tapping,

01:04:15.430 --> 01:04:19.490 align:middle line:84%
but we're ultimately trying
to take ourselves inside.

01:04:19.490 --> 01:04:23.768 align:middle line:90%
So this is actually best.

01:04:23.768 --> 01:04:25.435 align:middle line:84%
And then we'll have
the occipital-- now,

01:04:25.435 --> 01:04:27.790 align:middle line:90%
your occipital--

01:04:27.790 --> 01:04:30.490 align:middle line:84%
at the back of the head,
the occipital lobes actually

01:04:30.490 --> 01:04:32.030 align:middle line:90%
process visual information.

01:04:32.030 --> 01:04:34.420 align:middle line:84%
So when you close your
eyes, what happens

01:04:34.420 --> 01:04:39.670 align:middle line:84%
is that the activity in the
occipital starts to reduce.

01:04:39.670 --> 01:04:41.530 align:middle line:84%
The beta brainwaves
start to reduce,

01:04:41.530 --> 01:04:44.170 align:middle line:84%
and your brain becomes
flooded by alpha waves.

01:04:44.170 --> 01:04:47.560 align:middle line:84%
So the alpha waves go more
from like 7 to 13 Hertz,

01:04:47.560 --> 01:04:50.710 align:middle line:84%
and so the alpha is where we
get into a light meditative.

01:04:50.710 --> 01:04:55.450 align:middle line:84%
You can guide a visualization,
but your eyes are closed,

01:04:55.450 --> 01:04:58.990 align:middle line:84%
and you are going to feel
more lightly relaxed.

01:04:58.990 --> 01:05:02.410 align:middle line:84%
And it sort of opens up
more intuitive centers,

01:05:02.410 --> 01:05:03.530 align:middle line:90%
and so forth.

01:05:03.530 --> 01:05:05.560 align:middle line:90%
So we want to--

01:05:05.560 --> 01:05:08.542 align:middle line:90%
the best way really to do this--

01:05:08.542 --> 01:05:09.500 align:middle line:90%
we're not going to tap.

01:05:09.500 --> 01:05:13.070 align:middle line:84%
We're going to actually
suppress the stimulation,

01:05:13.070 --> 01:05:17.200 align:middle line:84%
and that would be just to go
into closing the eyes, focused

01:05:17.200 --> 01:05:20.000 align:middle line:90%
breathing, and quieting down.

01:05:20.000 --> 01:05:22.540 align:middle line:84%
And you could have
some music on,

01:05:22.540 --> 01:05:24.900 align:middle line:84%
but I would make it
like a really low drone.

01:05:24.900 --> 01:05:28.300 align:middle line:84%
We don't have too much time for
this right now, but ultimately

01:05:28.300 --> 01:05:30.220 align:middle line:84%
I would say 5 to
10 minutes of what

01:05:30.220 --> 01:05:32.590 align:middle line:84%
we call passive meditation,
where you're just

01:05:32.590 --> 01:05:34.000 align:middle line:90%
emptying your mind--

01:05:34.000 --> 01:05:37.540 align:middle line:84%
that really helps
shift us to the back.

01:05:37.540 --> 01:05:40.180 align:middle line:90%
And your eyes are closed.

01:05:40.180 --> 01:05:43.630 align:middle line:84%
And quieting down,
and so let's just

01:05:43.630 --> 01:05:46.180 align:middle line:90%
take just a minute to do this.

01:05:46.180 --> 01:05:48.160 align:middle line:84%
So just close your
eyes for a moment.

01:05:48.160 --> 01:05:53.930 align:middle line:90%


01:05:53.930 --> 01:05:57.900 align:middle line:84%
And take a few deep breaths
in through the nose,

01:05:57.900 --> 01:05:58.700 align:middle line:90%
out the mouth.

01:05:58.700 --> 01:06:03.680 align:middle line:90%


01:06:03.680 --> 01:06:05.440 align:middle line:90%
And just focus inside.

01:06:05.440 --> 01:06:18.650 align:middle line:90%


01:06:18.650 --> 01:06:26.510 align:middle line:84%
Focus into your breathing,
shifting your focus

01:06:26.510 --> 01:06:27.770 align:middle line:90%
from outer to inner.

01:06:27.770 --> 01:06:31.250 align:middle line:90%


01:06:31.250 --> 01:06:33.140 align:middle line:90%
Tune into more subtle realms.

01:06:33.140 --> 01:06:45.230 align:middle line:90%


01:06:45.230 --> 01:06:49.010 align:middle line:84%
Quieting the mind, and
just coming into a state

01:06:49.010 --> 01:06:54.750 align:middle line:90%
of calm and gentle relaxation.

01:06:54.750 --> 01:07:04.860 align:middle line:90%


01:07:04.860 --> 01:07:11.620 align:middle line:84%
And then taking a deep breath,
just come back for a moment.

01:07:11.620 --> 01:07:12.420 align:middle line:90%
Open your eyes.

01:07:12.420 --> 01:07:15.410 align:middle line:90%


01:07:15.410 --> 01:07:16.472 align:middle line:90%
How does that feel?

01:07:16.472 --> 01:07:17.336 align:middle line:90%
>> Good.

01:07:17.336 --> 01:07:21.020 align:middle line:84%
>> And that was just not
even two minutes, right?

01:07:21.020 --> 01:07:23.810 align:middle line:84%
So you can see--
can you start to see

01:07:23.810 --> 01:07:25.340 align:middle line:84%
how you could weave
these together

01:07:25.340 --> 01:07:29.870 align:middle line:84%
into sort of stimulating the
upper parts of the brain,

01:07:29.870 --> 01:07:31.970 align:middle line:84%
taking you back
further and deeper,

01:07:31.970 --> 01:07:34.550 align:middle line:84%
and then go refocus
to the inner.

01:07:34.550 --> 01:07:36.050 align:middle line:84%
And now we're going
to start going

01:07:36.050 --> 01:07:40.430 align:middle line:84%
from the cortex, the upper
range of the brain that we see,

01:07:40.430 --> 01:07:42.510 align:middle line:84%
into what we call
the limbic system.

01:07:42.510 --> 01:07:44.750 align:middle line:84%
We're going to start
going inward to the brain

01:07:44.750 --> 01:07:46.250 align:middle line:90%
and deeper into the brain.

01:07:46.250 --> 01:07:49.010 align:middle line:90%


01:07:49.010 --> 01:07:51.872 align:middle line:84%
So this is all-- you can weave
all of these little exercises

01:07:51.872 --> 01:07:54.080 align:middle line:84%
that we're talking about,
and doing, practicing here.

01:07:54.080 --> 01:07:55.950 align:middle line:84%
You can weave them
together into a practice

01:07:55.950 --> 01:07:59.960 align:middle line:84%
that you can do for 10
minutes, 15 minutes every day,

01:07:59.960 --> 01:08:03.590 align:middle line:84%
and it will really stimulate
and help you rewire your brain.

01:08:03.590 --> 01:08:06.740 align:middle line:84%
So the fourth bridge is what I
call the introspection bridge,

01:08:06.740 --> 01:08:10.790 align:middle line:84%
and the fourth bridge is
bridging from the cortex,

01:08:10.790 --> 01:08:14.090 align:middle line:84%
meaning the upper regions of the
brain into the limbic system.

01:08:14.090 --> 01:08:16.279 align:middle line:84%
And the limbic system
itself is a bridge.

01:08:16.279 --> 01:08:18.800 align:middle line:84%
It's sort of the middle
part of the brain.

01:08:18.800 --> 01:08:21.750 align:middle line:90%
And the limbic system is--

01:08:21.750 --> 01:08:26.090 align:middle line:84%
it's a gateway into
our emotions, right?

01:08:26.090 --> 01:08:30.600 align:middle line:84%
So limbic controls the
emotional side of our being,

01:08:30.600 --> 01:08:34.590 align:middle line:84%
and it connects very strongly
in with our endocrine system,

01:08:34.590 --> 01:08:38.120 align:middle line:84%
which as you may
or may not know,

01:08:38.120 --> 01:08:41.240 align:middle line:84%
the endocrine system relates
directly to your chakras.

01:08:41.240 --> 01:08:43.790 align:middle line:84%
So each of your chakras
has an endocrine gland

01:08:43.790 --> 01:08:46.490 align:middle line:84%
that it connects with,
and the more we stimulate

01:08:46.490 --> 01:08:48.500 align:middle line:84%
those endocrine glands
and the chakras,

01:08:48.500 --> 01:08:51.080 align:middle line:84%
the more it creates
this internal alchemy

01:08:51.080 --> 01:08:53.689 align:middle line:84%
within our body, because
the endocrine glands control

01:08:53.689 --> 01:08:56.359 align:middle line:84%
our hormones, which then
controls all kinds of things--

01:08:56.359 --> 01:08:59.960 align:middle line:90%
our mood and so forth.

01:08:59.960 --> 01:09:05.210 align:middle line:84%
So with the limbic system,
it's controlling emotions.

01:09:05.210 --> 01:09:06.590 align:middle line:90%
It's also-- and mood.

01:09:06.590 --> 01:09:10.410 align:middle line:84%
And it's also controlling
our autonomic nervous system,

01:09:10.410 --> 01:09:14.479 align:middle line:84%
so sympathetic, parasympathetic,
the nervous system,

01:09:14.479 --> 01:09:17.689 align:middle line:84%
and the sort of parts of
us that we're usually not

01:09:17.689 --> 01:09:20.569 align:middle line:84%
conscious of that are
regulating the body.

01:09:20.569 --> 01:09:25.729 align:middle line:84%
And it gives us-- when
we have good connectivity

01:09:25.729 --> 01:09:27.740 align:middle line:84%
within our limbic
system, it gives us

01:09:27.740 --> 01:09:30.397 align:middle line:90%
the ability to relax at will.

01:09:30.397 --> 01:09:31.939 align:middle line:84%
When you don't have
good connectivity

01:09:31.939 --> 01:09:35.930 align:middle line:84%
within the limbic system,
there might be tension.

01:09:35.930 --> 01:09:37.399 align:middle line:90%
There might be anxiety.

01:09:37.399 --> 01:09:41.819 align:middle line:84%
It's harder to relax at will
when those situations come up.

01:09:41.819 --> 01:09:43.760 align:middle line:84%
So this is a really
important part

01:09:43.760 --> 01:09:46.220 align:middle line:84%
of our being to get
a good connectivity

01:09:46.220 --> 01:09:48.859 align:middle line:84%
to so that we can
control how we feel,

01:09:48.859 --> 01:09:51.470 align:middle line:84%
no matter what's happening
around us, right?

01:09:51.470 --> 01:09:54.109 align:middle line:84%
And we can maintain a
sense of emotional balance

01:09:54.109 --> 01:09:58.460 align:middle line:84%
and centeredness, and we
can de-stress at will.

01:09:58.460 --> 01:10:02.000 align:middle line:84%
And using tools like meditation
is really helpful for that.

01:10:02.000 --> 01:10:06.870 align:middle line:10%
So alpha waves dominate here
within the limbic system,

01:10:06.870 --> 01:10:08.090 align:middle line:10%
and when you're in this--

01:10:08.090 --> 01:10:10.132 align:middle line:10%
when you're connecting
more to the limbic system,

01:10:10.132 --> 01:10:13.100 align:middle line:10%
it's going to feel a
little bit daydream-like.

01:10:13.100 --> 01:10:17.450 align:middle line:84%
And you can easily be off on
an imaginative journey, guided

01:10:17.450 --> 01:10:18.890 align:middle line:90%
imagery.

01:10:18.890 --> 01:10:22.700 align:middle line:84%
And it's often that transition
between waking and sleeping,

01:10:22.700 --> 01:10:23.630 align:middle line:90%
as well.

01:10:23.630 --> 01:10:26.990 align:middle line:84%
So you get a lot
of nice feelings.

01:10:26.990 --> 01:10:29.750 align:middle line:84%
You get some imagery
that comes in here,

01:10:29.750 --> 01:10:31.412 align:middle line:90%
and I think that this--

01:10:31.412 --> 01:10:32.870 align:middle line:84%
I call it the
introspection bridge,

01:10:32.870 --> 01:10:34.610 align:middle line:90%
because, again, we're shifting.

01:10:34.610 --> 01:10:36.770 align:middle line:84%
We've just shifted from
the outer to the inner.

01:10:36.770 --> 01:10:39.380 align:middle line:10%
We've refocused
towards our inner,

01:10:39.380 --> 01:10:42.260 align:middle line:10%
and now here introspection is
about really getting in touch

01:10:42.260 --> 01:10:44.310 align:middle line:10%
with how do I feel?

01:10:44.310 --> 01:10:46.170 align:middle line:90%
How do I feel?

01:10:46.170 --> 01:10:57.595 align:middle line:84%
And so when we
are introspective,

01:10:57.595 --> 01:11:03.010 align:middle line:84%
we can get more in touch
with our own inner being.

01:11:03.010 --> 01:11:07.030 align:middle line:84%
And so a lot of zen
meditation, just

01:11:07.030 --> 01:11:11.235 align:middle line:84%
sort of that quiet meditation,
guided imagery, tai chi,

01:11:11.235 --> 01:11:12.840 align:middle line:84%
qigong, yoga-- all
of those are going

01:11:12.840 --> 01:11:16.690 align:middle line:84%
to help you connect in to more
of an alpha brainwave state

01:11:16.690 --> 01:11:21.490 align:middle line:84%
and start tapping in
more to how you feel.

01:11:21.490 --> 01:11:25.450 align:middle line:84%
Do you want to know what
sense, besides hearing,

01:11:25.450 --> 01:11:27.730 align:middle line:84%
affects your limbic
system the most?

01:11:27.730 --> 01:11:29.005 align:middle line:90%
Any ideas?

01:11:29.005 --> 01:11:31.330 align:middle line:90%
>> [INAUDIBLE]

01:11:31.330 --> 01:11:32.650 align:middle line:90%
>> Smell.

01:11:32.650 --> 01:11:34.140 align:middle line:90%
Smell.

01:11:34.140 --> 01:11:35.890 align:middle line:84%
I don't know if any
of you could smell it,

01:11:35.890 --> 01:11:37.682 align:middle line:84%
but we were trying to
give you a little bit

01:11:37.682 --> 01:11:40.100 align:middle line:84%
of a boost of essential
oils while you're

01:11:40.100 --> 01:11:41.860 align:middle line:90%
in your little meditation.

01:11:41.860 --> 01:11:45.100 align:middle line:84%
And so your sense
of smell directly

01:11:45.100 --> 01:11:46.420 align:middle line:90%
connects to the limbic system.

01:11:46.420 --> 01:11:49.330 align:middle line:84%
So using things like
aromatherapy with high grade

01:11:49.330 --> 01:11:51.160 align:middle line:84%
therapeutic grade
essential oils is

01:11:51.160 --> 01:11:55.270 align:middle line:84%
really good for stimulating
your nerve-- your limbic system

01:11:55.270 --> 01:11:56.950 align:middle line:90%
and emotions, right?

01:11:56.950 --> 01:11:59.560 align:middle line:84%
So emotions are stored
here, emotional memories.

01:11:59.560 --> 01:12:02.770 align:middle line:84%
So when you want to release,
or heal, and re-pattern

01:12:02.770 --> 01:12:05.480 align:middle line:84%
old emotional traumas,
use aroma therapy.

01:12:05.480 --> 01:12:10.150 align:middle line:84%
And then also use the more
calming meditative type

01:12:10.150 --> 01:12:12.680 align:middle line:84%
of music that really gets
you into that alpha brainwave

01:12:12.680 --> 01:12:13.480 align:middle line:90%
state.

01:12:13.480 --> 01:12:18.430 align:middle line:90%


01:12:18.430 --> 01:12:20.770 align:middle line:84%
We use peppermint
and eucalyptus just

01:12:20.770 --> 01:12:22.450 align:middle line:84%
to kind of perk us
up a little bit,

01:12:22.450 --> 01:12:24.880 align:middle line:84%
but you could go with
any essential oils that

01:12:24.880 --> 01:12:26.890 align:middle line:90%
are calming.

01:12:26.890 --> 01:12:28.090 align:middle line:90%
Chamomile is really good.

01:12:28.090 --> 01:12:31.780 align:middle line:84%
Lavender is really good,
but use essential oils

01:12:31.780 --> 01:12:35.230 align:middle line:84%
often for supporting you
with your limbic system.

01:12:35.230 --> 01:12:36.730 align:middle line:84%
And then the other
thing that I like

01:12:36.730 --> 01:12:39.610 align:middle line:84%
for the limbic system is
the solfeggio frequency

01:12:39.610 --> 01:12:41.840 align:middle line:90%
tuned music.

01:12:41.840 --> 01:12:46.120 align:middle line:84%
And the solfeggio frequencies
are a little bit more--

01:12:46.120 --> 01:12:49.630 align:middle line:84%
they stir the emotions
in a certain way.

01:12:49.630 --> 01:12:54.220 align:middle line:84%
So music that is tuned
specifically to any of these--

01:12:54.220 --> 01:12:55.960 align:middle line:84%
they're not a system
of themselves.

01:12:55.960 --> 01:12:57.640 align:middle line:84%
You wouldn't do
solfeggio music that

01:12:57.640 --> 01:12:59.920 align:middle line:84%
works these as the
notes on the scale,

01:12:59.920 --> 01:13:03.940 align:middle line:84%
but the way the solfeggio
frequency musicians are working

01:13:03.940 --> 01:13:05.830 align:middle line:84%
is they take one of
these frequencies--

01:13:05.830 --> 01:13:09.250 align:middle line:84%
let's say the 528
Hertz frequency--

01:13:09.250 --> 01:13:13.120 align:middle line:84%
and they make that be
the sort of the base tone

01:13:13.120 --> 01:13:15.580 align:middle line:84%
that they then develop
the scale from.

01:13:15.580 --> 01:13:19.660 align:middle line:84%
And so music that is tuned
to the solfeggio frequencies

01:13:19.660 --> 01:13:21.100 align:middle line:90%
really stirs things.

01:13:21.100 --> 01:13:23.290 align:middle line:84%
And each one kind of
stirs a little bit

01:13:23.290 --> 01:13:25.000 align:middle line:90%
of a different energy.

01:13:25.000 --> 01:13:27.070 align:middle line:84%
Some of them are really
good for transformation

01:13:27.070 --> 01:13:28.540 align:middle line:90%
and emotional release.

01:13:28.540 --> 01:13:30.700 align:middle line:84%
Some of them-- the
528 Hertz is said

01:13:30.700 --> 01:13:34.950 align:middle line:84%
to be the miracle frequency
that really talks to your DNA.

01:13:34.950 --> 01:13:36.940 align:middle line:90%
And the higher frequencies--

01:13:36.940 --> 01:13:39.280 align:middle line:84%
as you go higher, they get
more and more celestial,

01:13:39.280 --> 01:13:40.570 align:middle line:90%
and more spiritual.

01:13:40.570 --> 01:13:43.220 align:middle line:84%
As you go lower, they
get more grounding.

01:13:43.220 --> 01:13:46.060 align:middle line:84%
So all the solfeggio frequencies
are really good to work with.

01:13:46.060 --> 01:13:49.720 align:middle line:84%
And just purely by
the fact that they're

01:13:49.720 --> 01:13:52.240 align:middle line:84%
different from our
normal tuning scale--

01:13:52.240 --> 01:13:55.000 align:middle line:84%
that, in and of itself, is
going to rewire your brain,

01:13:55.000 --> 01:13:56.590 align:middle line:90%
because you're--

01:13:56.590 --> 01:13:58.150 align:middle line:84%
through the sound,
through the music

01:13:58.150 --> 01:13:59.590 align:middle line:84%
you're training
yourself to listen

01:13:59.590 --> 01:14:02.080 align:middle line:84%
to frequencies
you're not used to,

01:14:02.080 --> 01:14:04.580 align:middle line:90%
and that challenges the brain.

01:14:04.580 --> 01:14:07.300 align:middle line:10%
And so I really
believe in the power

01:14:07.300 --> 01:14:09.880 align:middle line:10%
of solfeggio frequencies--

01:14:09.880 --> 01:14:12.760 align:middle line:10%
the 444, as well, even though
that's not a solfeggio,

01:14:12.760 --> 01:14:16.990 align:middle line:10%
but a lot of healing
frequencies are based on that.

01:14:16.990 --> 01:14:19.240 align:middle line:84%
And Pythagorean tuning,
which is more based

01:14:19.240 --> 01:14:22.900 align:middle line:84%
on perfect fifths
of a tuning scale.

01:14:22.900 --> 01:14:24.550 align:middle line:84%
So different tuning
scales can really

01:14:24.550 --> 01:14:30.790 align:middle line:84%
support you with challenging
the brain to really shift.

01:14:30.790 --> 01:14:34.060 align:middle line:84%
I actually created an album
called creative alchemy.

01:14:34.060 --> 01:14:37.720 align:middle line:84%
It's a meditation album that
works with all the solfeggio

01:14:37.720 --> 01:14:38.520 align:middle line:90%
frequencies.

01:14:38.520 --> 01:14:40.710 align:middle line:84%
There are seven different
steps in the meditation.

01:14:40.710 --> 01:14:42.640 align:middle line:90%
It's a guided imagery.

01:14:42.640 --> 01:14:45.452 align:middle line:84%
The musician is
J.S. Epperson, who

01:14:45.452 --> 01:14:47.410 align:middle line:84%
I've collaborated with
on a couple of projects,

01:14:47.410 --> 01:14:52.570 align:middle line:84%
and we have all the different
solfeggio frequencies in there.

01:14:52.570 --> 01:14:55.810 align:middle line:84%
And it relates to different
steps in the creative process

01:14:55.810 --> 01:14:58.538 align:middle line:84%
that I'm leading people
through in this meditation.

01:14:58.538 --> 01:15:00.580 align:middle line:84%
So it's all about helping
you with manifestation,

01:15:00.580 --> 01:15:03.460 align:middle line:84%
problem solving,
creative insights,

01:15:03.460 --> 01:15:06.160 align:middle line:84%
and so forth, and accessing a
higher state of consciousness

01:15:06.160 --> 01:15:09.340 align:middle line:84%
to then bring those
insights down into a plan

01:15:09.340 --> 01:15:11.200 align:middle line:90%
and into action.

01:15:11.200 --> 01:15:14.830 align:middle line:84%
So we're going to keep
pushing forward here.

01:15:14.830 --> 01:15:17.140 align:middle line:84%
Next we come into
the deepest part

01:15:17.140 --> 01:15:20.020 align:middle line:84%
of the brain, the old
brain, or the brain stem.

01:15:20.020 --> 01:15:23.020 align:middle line:84%
And here I call it
the doing bridge,

01:15:23.020 --> 01:15:27.870 align:middle line:84%
because the brain stem is
all about your actions.

01:15:27.870 --> 01:15:30.540 align:middle line:90%
It's patterned ways of being.

01:15:30.540 --> 01:15:33.560 align:middle line:84%
This is really the
foundation of the brain,

01:15:33.560 --> 01:15:37.030 align:middle line:84%
and it has to do
with the things we

01:15:37.030 --> 01:15:40.480 align:middle line:84%
do every day, the things
we say every day, just

01:15:40.480 --> 01:15:42.850 align:middle line:90%
the habitual way of living.

01:15:42.850 --> 01:15:44.390 align:middle line:90%
So it's our habits.

01:15:44.390 --> 01:15:47.110 align:middle line:84%
And if we want to
really get into greater

01:15:47.110 --> 01:15:49.750 align:middle line:84%
mastery of our lives, we have
to recognize, number one,

01:15:49.750 --> 01:15:51.160 align:middle line:90%
we are creatures of habit.

01:15:51.160 --> 01:15:53.200 align:middle line:84%
We're going to have
habits, but we need

01:15:53.200 --> 01:15:55.630 align:middle line:90%
to have habits that support us.

01:15:55.630 --> 01:16:00.040 align:middle line:84%
So doing things like a spiritual
practice, meditating every day.

01:16:00.040 --> 01:16:02.500 align:middle line:90%
Having some form of rituals--

01:16:02.500 --> 01:16:07.000 align:middle line:84%
ritualized behavior
programs the deep brain.

01:16:07.000 --> 01:16:09.520 align:middle line:84%
So rituals are going to be more
of a patterned way of doing

01:16:09.520 --> 01:16:12.820 align:middle line:84%
things that-- but bring
it with intention.

01:16:12.820 --> 01:16:16.420 align:middle line:84%
It's an intentional way of
doing things in that pattern

01:16:16.420 --> 01:16:18.730 align:middle line:90%
so that it really supports us.

01:16:18.730 --> 01:16:22.510 align:middle line:84%
Now, at the-- sitting at the
very top of the brain stem

01:16:22.510 --> 01:16:25.360 align:middle line:84%
is some core structures--
the pineal gland,

01:16:25.360 --> 01:16:27.400 align:middle line:84%
the pituitary gland,
the hypothalamus,

01:16:27.400 --> 01:16:31.480 align:middle line:84%
and thalamus glands, as
well as the hippocampus.

01:16:31.480 --> 01:16:37.660 align:middle line:84%
And these structures are said
to be the seat of consciousness

01:16:37.660 --> 01:16:40.310 align:middle line:84%
within the body or
within the brain.

01:16:40.310 --> 01:16:41.950 align:middle line:84%
And I think that
seat of consciousness

01:16:41.950 --> 01:16:45.790 align:middle line:84%
is in every cell of your
body, but these glands--

01:16:45.790 --> 01:16:48.670 align:middle line:84%
the pineal, pituitary,
and hypothalamus gland--

01:16:48.670 --> 01:16:52.150 align:middle line:84%
are really sitting right in
between the limbic system

01:16:52.150 --> 01:16:53.100 align:middle line:90%
and the brain stem.

01:16:53.100 --> 01:16:55.905 align:middle line:84%
So they are the bridge
between, and when you're deeper

01:16:55.905 --> 01:16:57.280 align:middle line:84%
in the brain stem,
usually you're

01:16:57.280 --> 01:17:00.190 align:middle line:90%
more unconscious or asleep.

01:17:00.190 --> 01:17:04.330 align:middle line:84%
But as we get into
the limbic is where

01:17:04.330 --> 01:17:05.680 align:middle line:90%
you start to wake up, right?

01:17:05.680 --> 01:17:06.970 align:middle line:90%
So it's a transition place.

01:17:06.970 --> 01:17:08.650 align:middle line:90%
So these are gateways.

01:17:08.650 --> 01:17:11.320 align:middle line:84%
And we actually have
a panel at 12:30,

01:17:11.320 --> 01:17:15.160 align:middle line:84%
the Lisa Garr panel on science
and consciousness that I,

01:17:15.160 --> 01:17:17.968 align:middle line:84%
and Gregg Braden, and a bunch
of other scientists and people

01:17:17.968 --> 01:17:20.260 align:middle line:84%
are-- we're going to be
talking about the pineal gland.

01:17:20.260 --> 01:17:23.840 align:middle line:84%
So it's very much about
this intuitive center,

01:17:23.840 --> 01:17:29.170 align:middle line:84%
but all of these are like that
central core of our intuition

01:17:29.170 --> 01:17:31.180 align:middle line:90%
that we can tap into here.

01:17:31.180 --> 01:17:35.350 align:middle line:84%
And this system, the brain
stem, is somatic, right?

01:17:35.350 --> 01:17:38.620 align:middle line:84%
So it's your
somatosensory system.

01:17:38.620 --> 01:17:42.940 align:middle line:84%
So it controls sweaty palms, the
hairs standing up on the back

01:17:42.940 --> 01:17:46.690 align:middle line:84%
of the arm or the neck, your
heart rate, your breathing

01:17:46.690 --> 01:17:49.450 align:middle line:90%
rate, where you're breathing.

01:17:49.450 --> 01:17:53.200 align:middle line:84%
All of those things are
somatic, and this is

01:17:53.200 --> 01:17:54.940 align:middle line:90%
controlled by the brain stem.

01:17:54.940 --> 01:17:57.100 align:middle line:84%
So somatic therapies are
really good for helping

01:17:57.100 --> 01:18:01.360 align:middle line:84%
rewire your brain stem,
as is breath work,

01:18:01.360 --> 01:18:03.470 align:middle line:90%
as is the tapping, right?

01:18:03.470 --> 01:18:06.780 align:middle line:90%
So the physical sensations.

01:18:06.780 --> 01:18:10.480 align:middle line:84%
And when we get into a theta
brainwave frequency, which

01:18:10.480 --> 01:18:13.510 align:middle line:84%
is from 3 to about
7 or 8 Hertz, that

01:18:13.510 --> 01:18:16.840 align:middle line:84%
is when you're really
getting into the old brain.

01:18:16.840 --> 01:18:20.630 align:middle line:84%
So theta is actually
the goal of meditation.

01:18:20.630 --> 01:18:23.920 align:middle line:84%
Guided visualizations don't
typically get us into theta.

01:18:23.920 --> 01:18:28.690 align:middle line:84%
They keep us in alpha, but when
you get into a deeper state

01:18:28.690 --> 01:18:31.600 align:middle line:84%
and you maintain conscious
awareness, that's

01:18:31.600 --> 01:18:33.430 align:middle line:90%
the goal of meditation--

01:18:33.430 --> 01:18:38.350 align:middle line:84%
is to get into theta and hold
it for as long as you can.

01:18:38.350 --> 01:18:40.055 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes we're
only hitting theta

01:18:40.055 --> 01:18:41.680 align:middle line:84%
when we're just
transitioning to sleep,

01:18:41.680 --> 01:18:44.080 align:middle line:84%
and we're just there
for a few minutes,

01:18:44.080 --> 01:18:45.790 align:middle line:84%
but if you can get
into that state,

01:18:45.790 --> 01:18:47.920 align:middle line:84%
and then hold it,
and prolong it,

01:18:47.920 --> 01:18:51.670 align:middle line:84%
now you're going to be
able to get a really--

01:18:51.670 --> 01:18:54.280 align:middle line:84%
it's a deep healing state,
a very deep healing state.

01:18:54.280 --> 01:18:58.490 align:middle line:84%
Your body goes into what we call
the trophotropic healing state.

01:18:58.490 --> 01:19:02.000 align:middle line:84%
So you want to really
work with that.

01:19:02.000 --> 01:19:07.120 align:middle line:84%
The meditation practice is
about getting into theta.

01:19:07.120 --> 01:19:10.400 align:middle line:84%
I did create another meditation
album called "Quantum Insight"

01:19:10.400 --> 01:19:12.850 align:middle line:84%
that is a deep theta
meditation state.

01:19:12.850 --> 01:19:16.000 align:middle line:84%
It's just breath,
and visualizing fire

01:19:16.000 --> 01:19:19.190 align:middle line:84%
and water coming together in
an alchemical kind of process.

01:19:19.190 --> 01:19:23.080 align:middle line:84%
It works the chakras, but it
is very much about accessing

01:19:23.080 --> 01:19:25.520 align:middle line:90%
this kind of deeper state.

01:19:25.520 --> 01:19:28.440 align:middle line:84%
So it's more somatic
in its nature.

01:19:28.440 --> 01:19:31.240 align:middle line:84%
And then getting you
into that quantum zone,

01:19:31.240 --> 01:19:33.670 align:middle line:84%
because when you
can get into theta,

01:19:33.670 --> 01:19:36.980 align:middle line:84%
now you're really
achieving a coherent state,

01:19:36.980 --> 01:19:38.860 align:middle line:84%
and now you can
really start to tap

01:19:38.860 --> 01:19:41.230 align:middle line:84%
into that universal
mind and that expanded

01:19:41.230 --> 01:19:42.920 align:middle line:90%
state of consciousness.

01:19:42.920 --> 01:19:51.220 align:middle line:84%
So this doing bridge is actions,
but it's also deep meditation.

01:19:51.220 --> 01:19:52.810 align:middle line:84%
And when you can
train yourself to get

01:19:52.810 --> 01:19:55.360 align:middle line:84%
into that deep meditation
and stay conscious,

01:19:55.360 --> 01:19:57.520 align:middle line:84%
now you can really
start to access

01:19:57.520 --> 01:20:02.740 align:middle line:84%
expanded states of awareness
and that universal mind.

01:20:02.740 --> 01:20:06.850 align:middle line:84%
So again, here's a
breathing technique

01:20:06.850 --> 01:20:08.710 align:middle line:84%
I encourage that
will support you.

01:20:08.710 --> 01:20:09.910 align:middle line:84%
We're not going to
practice it right now,

01:20:09.910 --> 01:20:11.380 align:middle line:84%
because we're
running out of time,

01:20:11.380 --> 01:20:13.240 align:middle line:90%
but I'm going to suggest--

01:20:13.240 --> 01:20:14.912 align:middle line:84%
and it supports you
getting into theta.

01:20:14.912 --> 01:20:16.870 align:middle line:84%
So you're going to breathe
in through your nose

01:20:16.870 --> 01:20:19.060 align:middle line:90%
to a count of five.

01:20:19.060 --> 01:20:20.620 align:middle line:84%
You're going to
hold your breath,

01:20:20.620 --> 01:20:24.310 align:middle line:84%
and you're going to pull
it down into the hara.

01:20:24.310 --> 01:20:27.280 align:middle line:84%
And you're going to hold the
breath for a count of 10.

01:20:27.280 --> 01:20:29.010 align:middle line:84%
And then as you
breathe out, you're

01:20:29.010 --> 01:20:32.470 align:middle line:84%
going to do a slow, deep
out breath with your mouth

01:20:32.470 --> 01:20:35.050 align:middle line:90%
open to a count of 10.

01:20:35.050 --> 01:20:37.780 align:middle line:90%
So in through the nose for five.

01:20:37.780 --> 01:20:41.260 align:middle line:90%
Hold it for a count of 10.

01:20:41.260 --> 01:20:43.910 align:middle line:84%
And then as you breathe
out through the mouth,

01:20:43.910 --> 01:20:46.810 align:middle line:84%
long and slow breath
to a count of 10 out.

01:20:46.810 --> 01:20:50.302 align:middle line:84%
And you just do
that for a while,

01:20:50.302 --> 01:20:52.510 align:middle line:84%
and you will find yourself
dropping into theta pretty

01:20:52.510 --> 01:20:53.490 align:middle line:90%
quickly.

01:20:53.490 --> 01:20:57.650 align:middle line:84%
And it's in that holding,
the space between things

01:20:57.650 --> 01:21:02.360 align:middle line:84%
where you're really going to
start accessing a more quantum

01:21:02.360 --> 01:21:04.130 align:middle line:90%
state.

01:21:04.130 --> 01:21:05.900 align:middle line:84%
And then it takes
us from the brain,

01:21:05.900 --> 01:21:08.550 align:middle line:84%
and we start dropping
into the heart.

01:21:08.550 --> 01:21:12.320 align:middle line:84%
So the heart is
also a brain center,

01:21:12.320 --> 01:21:16.160 align:middle line:84%
and there are a lot of neurons,
and glial cells, and so forth

01:21:16.160 --> 01:21:18.500 align:middle line:84%
in the heart, just like
there are in the brain.

01:21:18.500 --> 01:21:20.180 align:middle line:90%
And in fact, your heart--

01:21:20.180 --> 01:21:22.580 align:middle line:84%
your heart started beating
before your brain did.

01:21:22.580 --> 01:21:25.880 align:middle line:84%
So your heart is more
primary than the brain,

01:21:25.880 --> 01:21:28.692 align:middle line:84%
but our science today is
so focused on the brain,

01:21:28.692 --> 01:21:30.650 align:middle line:84%
and the only people that
I know that are really

01:21:30.650 --> 01:21:32.270 align:middle line:84%
trying to bring out
the wisdom of the heart

01:21:32.270 --> 01:21:34.145 align:middle line:84%
is the HeartMath Institute
and the people who

01:21:34.145 --> 01:21:36.960 align:middle line:90%
are reporting their results.

01:21:36.960 --> 01:21:41.462 align:middle line:84%
So we want to really
sink into the heart.

01:21:41.462 --> 01:21:42.920 align:middle line:84%
And of course, the
heart's energies

01:21:42.920 --> 01:21:45.020 align:middle line:84%
are about gratitude,
love, compassion.

01:21:45.020 --> 01:21:48.890 align:middle line:90%


01:21:48.890 --> 01:21:51.140 align:middle line:84%
We're getting really
deep into delta.

01:21:51.140 --> 01:21:54.050 align:middle line:84%
So that's like-- most people
when they're in delta--

01:21:54.050 --> 01:21:56.600 align:middle line:84%
they're in a coma, or
they're deeply asleep.

01:21:56.600 --> 01:21:59.750 align:middle line:90%


01:21:59.750 --> 01:22:02.270 align:middle line:84%
But I know that you can train
yourself to actually maintain

01:22:02.270 --> 01:22:05.820 align:middle line:84%
conscious awareness when
you're in delta, and--

01:22:05.820 --> 01:22:10.220 align:middle line:84%
but in that delta state, you
would lose all sense of self.

01:22:10.220 --> 01:22:14.180 align:middle line:84%
You would be merging
with the universal.

01:22:14.180 --> 01:22:16.460 align:middle line:84%
You would be in a great
state of gratitude,

01:22:16.460 --> 01:22:20.630 align:middle line:84%
and compassion, and total
heart-brain coherence.

01:22:20.630 --> 01:22:24.230 align:middle line:84%
And with the heart, it
puts out a really big

01:22:24.230 --> 01:22:27.940 align:middle line:84%
electromagnetic field,
bigger than the brain.

01:22:27.940 --> 01:22:30.077 align:middle line:90%
It comes out at--

01:22:30.077 --> 01:22:32.660 align:middle line:84%
they can measure it out to about
three feet out from the body,

01:22:32.660 --> 01:22:35.200 align:middle line:84%
but I think it goes out
much further than that.

01:22:35.200 --> 01:22:38.510 align:middle line:90%
And the heart--

01:22:38.510 --> 01:22:41.390 align:middle line:84%
I mentioned before how
the brain was in Taoist

01:22:41.390 --> 01:22:43.370 align:middle line:90%
qigong is the upper dantian.

01:22:43.370 --> 01:22:46.780 align:middle line:90%
The heart is the middle dantian.

01:22:46.780 --> 01:22:50.540 align:middle line:84%
And then the hara, or the
gut, is the lower dantian.

01:22:50.540 --> 01:22:52.640 align:middle line:84%
So these are major
energy centers,

01:22:52.640 --> 01:22:56.780 align:middle line:84%
and what's fascinating is that
science today is realizing

01:22:56.780 --> 01:22:59.630 align:middle line:84%
they're all connected
in very strongly

01:22:59.630 --> 01:23:01.770 align:middle line:90%
to the central nervous system.

01:23:01.770 --> 01:23:02.930 align:middle line:90%
So the heart is the brain.

01:23:02.930 --> 01:23:04.410 align:middle line:90%
The gut is a brain.

01:23:04.410 --> 01:23:05.690 align:middle line:90%
The brain is a brain.

01:23:05.690 --> 01:23:11.160 align:middle line:84%
And so these are all centers of
consciousness within our body.

01:23:11.160 --> 01:23:14.360 align:middle line:84%
So when we can really
get into that delta state

01:23:14.360 --> 01:23:20.060 align:middle line:84%
and into that deep connection
to the heart and gratitude--

01:23:20.060 --> 01:23:22.910 align:middle line:84%
gratitude brings us into
a coherent state that

01:23:22.910 --> 01:23:25.190 align:middle line:90%
unifies the mind and heart.

01:23:25.190 --> 01:23:27.200 align:middle line:84%
And when we then
send out compassion--

01:23:27.200 --> 01:23:29.450 align:middle line:90%
so the Dalai Lama's meditators--

01:23:29.450 --> 01:23:31.370 align:middle line:84%
they did some studies
on them, and they

01:23:31.370 --> 01:23:37.130 align:middle line:84%
went into a deep theta state,
and then maybe even deeper.

01:23:37.130 --> 01:23:40.190 align:middle line:84%
And then at some point they
switched from feeling gratitude

01:23:40.190 --> 01:23:43.400 align:middle line:84%
and compassion within themselves
to sending that compassion out

01:23:43.400 --> 01:23:44.460 align:middle line:90%
to the world.

01:23:44.460 --> 01:23:46.502 align:middle line:84%
And when they started
sending that compassion out

01:23:46.502 --> 01:23:49.010 align:middle line:84%
to the world, they
registered a gamma frequency

01:23:49.010 --> 01:23:51.290 align:middle line:84%
that came up, and
then swept forward,

01:23:51.290 --> 01:23:53.420 align:middle line:90%
and swept back and down.

01:23:53.420 --> 01:23:57.020 align:middle line:84%
And so it created this very
unified mind-heart state

01:23:57.020 --> 01:23:58.080 align:middle line:90%
of being.

01:23:58.080 --> 01:24:02.240 align:middle line:84%
So gratitude is your key for
tapping into the heart field

01:24:02.240 --> 01:24:05.030 align:middle line:84%
and just centering your
focus into the heart,

01:24:05.030 --> 01:24:07.910 align:middle line:84%
breathing into the heart,
and really slowing down

01:24:07.910 --> 01:24:10.530 align:middle line:84%
the brainwaves into
a deeper state.

01:24:10.530 --> 01:24:14.120 align:middle line:84%
And then finally,
the seventh bridge

01:24:14.120 --> 01:24:17.840 align:middle line:84%
brings us into the very center
point of that energy field

01:24:17.840 --> 01:24:18.640 align:middle line:90%
flow.

01:24:18.640 --> 01:24:21.110 align:middle line:90%
And the center of--

01:24:21.110 --> 01:24:23.690 align:middle line:84%
I know we'd like to see
the center is the heart,

01:24:23.690 --> 01:24:27.230 align:middle line:84%
but the center is
actually your hara.

01:24:27.230 --> 01:24:31.160 align:middle line:84%
The actual center of gravity
of your body is right here,

01:24:31.160 --> 01:24:34.280 align:middle line:84%
and in tai chi, qigong,
all of that-- everything

01:24:34.280 --> 01:24:37.310 align:middle line:84%
moves around this
point here, the hara,

01:24:37.310 --> 01:24:40.280 align:middle line:84%
which is about an inch, inch
and a half below the navel.

01:24:40.280 --> 01:24:44.240 align:middle line:84%
So the very center
of that toroidal flow

01:24:44.240 --> 01:24:46.670 align:middle line:90%
is accessed here in the hara.

01:24:46.670 --> 01:24:50.430 align:middle line:84%
So once you've come from
the brain down to the heart,

01:24:50.430 --> 01:24:53.160 align:middle line:84%
you want to then focus
your breath into the hara.

01:24:53.160 --> 01:24:55.880 align:middle line:90%


01:24:55.880 --> 01:24:57.710 align:middle line:10%
As if your eyes are
down here, you just

01:24:57.710 --> 01:25:02.390 align:middle line:10%
bring your whole attention
down into the hara and breathe.

01:25:02.390 --> 01:25:05.030 align:middle line:84%
And then at some
point, just like you're

01:25:05.030 --> 01:25:08.480 align:middle line:84%
focusing in on that
space between things,

01:25:08.480 --> 01:25:12.410 align:middle line:90%
the gap, the zero point--

01:25:12.410 --> 01:25:15.410 align:middle line:90%
and you're surrendering into it.

01:25:15.410 --> 01:25:19.640 align:middle line:84%
That's your final
step, the final bridge.

01:25:19.640 --> 01:25:25.160 align:middle line:10%
And as we do that, we
are then able to access

01:25:25.160 --> 01:25:29.420 align:middle line:10%
that full expansion
out into the universe.

01:25:29.420 --> 01:25:32.900 align:middle line:10%
You will feel
yourself-- the micro--

01:25:32.900 --> 01:25:35.120 align:middle line:10%
the macrocosm within
the microcosm.

01:25:35.120 --> 01:25:37.640 align:middle line:10%
You will feel that the
universe is within you,

01:25:37.640 --> 01:25:39.360 align:middle line:10%
and you are one
with the universe.

01:25:39.360 --> 01:25:43.130 align:middle line:10%
So you really lose that
sense of self here.

01:25:43.130 --> 01:25:46.850 align:middle line:10%
And so this final key
is about stillness, just

01:25:46.850 --> 01:25:49.665 align:middle line:10%
coming into that
place of stillness.

01:25:49.665 --> 01:25:51.290 align:middle line:10%
So that's why I say
focus on the breath

01:25:51.290 --> 01:25:55.580 align:middle line:10%
between as you shift your
focus into the hara, because--

01:25:55.580 --> 01:25:59.500 align:middle line:10%
and in ancient traditions,
they call that the void.

01:25:59.500 --> 01:26:01.180 align:middle line:10%
When you breathe
into the hara, it

01:26:01.180 --> 01:26:04.486 align:middle line:10%
helps you most strongly
connect to the void.

01:26:04.486 --> 01:26:06.520 align:middle line:10%
So that void is just emptiness.

01:26:06.520 --> 01:26:07.960 align:middle line:10%
It's nothingness, right?

01:26:07.960 --> 01:26:11.950 align:middle line:10%
And so the ultimate
expansion beyond the self

01:26:11.950 --> 01:26:15.670 align:middle line:10%
is this final key of stillness,
but within your body,

01:26:15.670 --> 01:26:16.870 align:middle line:10%
you can wire it.

01:26:16.870 --> 01:26:19.630 align:middle line:10%
And then no matter what's
happening through your day,

01:26:19.630 --> 01:26:20.800 align:middle line:10%
if you're ever--

01:26:20.800 --> 01:26:23.470 align:middle line:10%
if you have a practice of this,
where you're bringing yourself

01:26:23.470 --> 01:26:27.582 align:middle line:10%
from the front to the back,
and down, and down, then,

01:26:27.582 --> 01:26:29.540 align:middle line:10%
no matter what's happening
throughout your day,

01:26:29.540 --> 01:26:32.710 align:middle line:10%
you can easily just do a
few breaths and a few taps

01:26:32.710 --> 01:26:33.610 align:middle line:10%
into these areas.

01:26:33.610 --> 01:26:37.175 align:middle line:10%
And it'll automatically start to
shift you back into that state,

01:26:37.175 --> 01:26:39.160 align:middle line:10%
so but we need to
do daily practice

01:26:39.160 --> 01:26:42.520 align:middle line:10%
to get it wired so that it's
so readily available for us

01:26:42.520 --> 01:26:44.210 align:middle line:10%
to do it like that.

01:26:44.210 --> 01:26:45.850 align:middle line:10%
And it doesn't need
to take very long.

01:26:45.850 --> 01:26:48.520 align:middle line:10%


01:26:48.520 --> 01:26:53.200 align:middle line:10%
So you can think of,
again here, the macrocosm

01:26:53.200 --> 01:26:56.790 align:middle line:10%
within your own field,
within your own microcosm.

01:26:56.790 --> 01:27:01.230 align:middle line:10%
And the chakra system,
again focusing on--

01:27:01.230 --> 01:27:03.550 align:middle line:10%
from the brain to the
heart to the hara,

01:27:03.550 --> 01:27:08.650 align:middle line:10%
so going from the upper to the
middle to the lower dantian.

01:27:08.650 --> 01:27:10.690 align:middle line:10%
And focusing on
the space between.

01:27:10.690 --> 01:27:13.060 align:middle line:10%
This is just a little
bit of connection

01:27:13.060 --> 01:27:16.780 align:middle line:10%
in today's modern science
between the brain and the gut.

01:27:16.780 --> 01:27:21.430 align:middle line:84%
The other two meditation
albums that I have are--

01:27:21.430 --> 01:27:22.930 align:middle line:84%
the other thing I
wanted to tell you

01:27:22.930 --> 01:27:28.570 align:middle line:84%
is that the upper dantian and
the middle, and the lower all

01:27:28.570 --> 01:27:31.920 align:middle line:84%
relate to the tree of life,
as well, on the middle pillar.

01:27:31.920 --> 01:27:35.360 align:middle line:84%
The top of the tree is
like the upper dantian.

01:27:35.360 --> 01:27:38.910 align:middle line:84%
The middle of the tree of
life is the middle dantian

01:27:38.910 --> 01:27:41.035 align:middle line:90%
And then the hara is--

01:27:41.035 --> 01:27:43.720 align:middle line:84%
you sew it on the tree of life,
and then that's more actually

01:27:43.720 --> 01:27:45.850 align:middle line:90%
at the feet.

01:27:45.850 --> 01:27:48.640 align:middle line:84%
It's the root of the feet, but
it's usually more the feet.

01:27:48.640 --> 01:27:50.980 align:middle line:84%
So it's interesting to see
how these traditions are all

01:27:50.980 --> 01:27:51.940 align:middle line:90%
aligning.

01:27:51.940 --> 01:27:56.290 align:middle line:84%
We have the ancient Taoist
tradition with the dantians.

01:27:56.290 --> 01:27:58.870 align:middle line:84%
We have the Kabbalistic
tradition in the middle pillar.

01:27:58.870 --> 01:28:00.740 align:middle line:90%
We have modern science.

01:28:00.740 --> 01:28:06.820 align:middle line:84%
And they're all pointing to
these same points in our body.

01:28:06.820 --> 01:28:09.830 align:middle line:84%
And so here's just
a little summary.

01:28:09.830 --> 01:28:11.690 align:middle line:84%
We have some
handouts here that we

01:28:11.690 --> 01:28:14.560 align:middle line:84%
are going to pass around
that just give you

01:28:14.560 --> 01:28:17.410 align:middle line:84%
the summary of each
of the seven bridges.

01:28:17.410 --> 01:28:21.040 align:middle line:10%
And hopefully a few of the
exercises are in there,

01:28:21.040 --> 01:28:25.340 align:middle line:10%
and hopefully you also took some
good notes on those exercises.

01:28:25.340 --> 01:28:30.490 align:middle line:84%
So I want to just thank you all
for joining me this morning,

01:28:30.490 --> 01:28:34.450 align:middle line:84%
and hopefully we'll see you
again at the panel at 12:30.

01:28:34.450 --> 01:28:36.860 align:middle line:84%
And I hope that you enjoy
the rest of your conference.

01:28:36.860 --> 01:28:38.110 align:middle line:90%
So thank you very much.

01:28:38.110 --> 01:28:40.860 align:middle line:90%
[APPLAUSE]

01:28:40.860 --> 01:28:48.000 align:middle line:90%
