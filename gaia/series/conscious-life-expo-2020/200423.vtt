00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.440 align:middle line:90%


00:00:06.440 --> 00:00:11.710 align:middle line:84%
>> I'm so thrilled to
welcome David Avocado Wolfe

00:00:11.710 --> 00:00:13.013 align:middle line:90%
to Conscious Life Expo.

00:00:13.013 --> 00:00:13.930 align:middle line:90%
>> That was wonderful.

00:00:13.930 --> 00:00:14.980 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:00:14.980 --> 00:00:15.890 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:00:15.890 --> 00:00:16.560 align:middle line:90%
Oh, that was good.

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:17.085 align:middle line:90%
>> Thank you.

00:00:17.085 --> 00:00:18.050 align:middle line:90%
>> I appreciate you.

00:00:18.050 --> 00:00:19.250 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:00:19.250 --> 00:00:22.050 align:middle line:84%
All right, we've got a lot to
cover in the next 20 minutes.

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:22.850 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:00:22.850 --> 00:00:25.350 align:middle line:84%
Are you going to hang in
there with me for 20 minutes?

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:28.520 align:middle line:10%
OK, so I was going through my
presentations from past years,

00:00:28.520 --> 00:00:31.470 align:middle line:10%
and I thought, oh, I haven't
done this one in a while.

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:32.750 align:middle line:10%
And so that's what we're
going to go through today.

00:00:32.750 --> 00:00:34.850 align:middle line:10%
We're going to go through
the Kirlian photography,

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:36.510 align:middle line:10%
the difference
between fresh food,

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:41.330 align:middle line:10%
live food, cooked food, the
difference between, say, oils,

00:00:41.330 --> 00:00:44.810 align:middle line:10%
the difference between
herbs, energetically.

00:00:44.810 --> 00:00:48.200 align:middle line:84%
And this particular image
is one that I really enjoy.

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:50.450 align:middle line:84%
It's the only one that
exists, a Kirlian photograph

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:52.460 align:middle line:90%
of an avocado.

00:00:52.460 --> 00:00:53.720 align:middle line:90%
I am an avocado grower.

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:58.047 align:middle line:84%
For 42 years, I've
been growing avocados.

00:00:58.047 --> 00:00:59.630 align:middle line:84%
And it started in
Southern California,

00:00:59.630 --> 00:01:00.837 align:middle line:90%
right on the border.

00:01:00.837 --> 00:01:01.670 align:middle line:90%
Right on the border.

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:04.760 align:middle line:84%
I lived right across the
street on Proctor Valley Road.

00:01:04.760 --> 00:01:07.910 align:middle line:84%
I was on one side with
my uncle and his family.

00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:09.838 align:middle line:84%
And on the other
side was a big ranch,

00:01:09.838 --> 00:01:10.880 align:middle line:90%
and there was the border.

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:15.230 align:middle line:90%
There's the actual wall today.

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:18.023 align:middle line:84%
And back in 1978,
we had a family

00:01:18.023 --> 00:01:19.940 align:middle line:84%
that came across the
border, a Mexican family,

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:20.910 align:middle line:90%
and we took them in.

00:01:20.910 --> 00:01:22.717 align:middle line:90%
And they're still there.

00:01:22.717 --> 00:01:23.550 align:middle line:90%
They're still there.

00:01:23.550 --> 00:01:25.970 align:middle line:84%
And that was when we first
started planting avocados

00:01:25.970 --> 00:01:27.320 align:middle line:90%
on that property.

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:29.580 align:middle line:84%
And interestingly, I was
just with Carlos Santana,

00:01:29.580 --> 00:01:31.100 align:middle line:90%
so I've been playing Santana.

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:32.840 align:middle line:84%
And when you grew
up on the border,

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:36.380 align:middle line:84%
especially back then, the
only TV and the only antennas

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:39.290 align:middle line:84%
we could get, and
radio, was Mexican.

00:01:39.290 --> 00:01:43.202 align:middle line:84%
So we grew up with Raul
Velasco on Mexican TV.

00:01:43.202 --> 00:01:44.285 align:middle line:90%
Anybody know Raul Velasco?

00:01:44.285 --> 00:01:47.900 align:middle line:84%
He was the Johnny Carson
of Mexico for 30 years.

00:01:47.900 --> 00:01:49.040 align:middle line:90%
Or more like Ed Sullivan.

00:01:49.040 --> 00:01:50.750 align:middle line:84%
Like if you were
a music act, you

00:01:50.750 --> 00:01:53.120 align:middle line:84%
had to go through his
show to become big.

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:54.607 align:middle line:90%
And he knew every musician.

00:01:54.607 --> 00:01:55.815 align:middle line:90%
He knew all the entertainers.

00:01:55.815 --> 00:01:57.350 align:middle line:90%
He was an amazing guy.

00:01:57.350 --> 00:02:00.712 align:middle line:84%
Years later, I became friends
with his daughter unknowingly.

00:02:00.712 --> 00:02:02.420 align:middle line:84%
She came on a retreat
with us, and then I

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:04.520 align:middle line:84%
got to talking with
her, where are you from?

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:05.360 align:middle line:90%
Mexico City.

00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:07.250 align:middle line:90%
And oh, you know, your name?

00:02:07.250 --> 00:02:09.840 align:middle line:90%
Karina Velasco.

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:12.430 align:middle line:90%
Finally I was like, wait, what?

00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:14.180 align:middle line:84%
She's like, oh yeah,
my dad, Raul Velasco.

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:17.810 align:middle line:84%
And I was like, wait, I saw
you as a little kid on TV

00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:19.800 align:middle line:90%
growing up on the border.

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:21.800 align:middle line:84%
So I was just with Carlos
Santana, and he said--

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:22.790 align:middle line:84%
I said, Carlos,
where are you from?

00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:24.710 align:middle line:84%
Because I knew he was like,
from California or Mexico

00:02:24.710 --> 00:02:25.510 align:middle line:90%
or something.

00:02:25.510 --> 00:02:27.860 align:middle line:90%
And he said, oh, I'm from TJ.

00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:31.120 align:middle line:84%
And only somebody from TJ says
they're from TJ like that.

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:33.450 align:middle line:90%
So I was like, oh, he's from TJ.

00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:34.250 align:middle line:90%
That's right there.

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:37.370 align:middle line:84%
So we grew up like, right
there, right across the border,

00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:38.780 align:middle line:90%
growing these avocados.

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:40.113 align:middle line:90%
And that's where it all started.

00:02:40.113 --> 00:02:42.230 align:middle line:84%
Now I grow in Hawaii,
and we have two farms.

00:02:42.230 --> 00:02:44.862 align:middle line:84%
We have one on the big island
and we have one on Kauai.

00:02:44.862 --> 00:02:46.820 align:middle line:84%
And we're having a lot
of fun growing avocados.

00:02:46.820 --> 00:02:48.410 align:middle line:84%
I'll show you some
of those images,

00:02:48.410 --> 00:02:49.410 align:middle line:90%
and what all that means.

00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:50.750 align:middle line:90%
Avocado is such a great choice.

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:53.333 align:middle line:84%
If you're confused after today,
and you're like, what do I do?

00:02:53.333 --> 00:02:56.210 align:middle line:84%
All you have to do
is eat an avocado.

00:02:56.210 --> 00:02:58.920 align:middle line:90%
That's it.

00:02:58.920 --> 00:03:00.770 align:middle line:84%
You could be like,
what did he say to eat?

00:03:00.770 --> 00:03:02.030 align:middle line:90%
Something about what?

00:03:02.030 --> 00:03:04.290 align:middle line:90%
Avocado, OK.

00:03:04.290 --> 00:03:06.170 align:middle line:84%
And that's your default
position, all right?

00:03:06.170 --> 00:03:08.128 align:middle line:84%
So we're just going to
hit that default button.

00:03:08.128 --> 00:03:13.430 align:middle line:84%
OK, so this is a Kirlian
photography presentation

00:03:13.430 --> 00:03:17.880 align:middle line:84%
that I developed, it's
getting close to 20 years ago.

00:03:17.880 --> 00:03:18.680 align:middle line:90%
20 years ago.

00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:20.810 align:middle line:90%
2002, 2003.

00:03:20.810 --> 00:03:22.280 align:middle line:90%
Roughly right around there.

00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:24.500 align:middle line:84%
And so I'm going to show
you some of these images.

00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:27.100 align:middle line:84%
Some these images have
not been seen in years,

00:03:27.100 --> 00:03:28.100 align:middle line:90%
and they're really cool.

00:03:28.100 --> 00:03:30.622 align:middle line:84%
Some microscopic images,
some other kinds of images.

00:03:30.622 --> 00:03:31.580 align:middle line:90%
So let's go through it.

00:03:31.580 --> 00:03:32.880 align:middle line:90%
You guys ready?

00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:34.920 align:middle line:90%
Who's ready?

00:03:34.920 --> 00:03:36.330 align:middle line:90%
You guys didn't sound ready.

00:03:36.330 --> 00:03:37.130 align:middle line:90%
Who's ready?

00:03:37.130 --> 00:03:38.090 align:middle line:90%
You guys ready to rock?

00:03:38.090 --> 00:03:39.280 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:40.730 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:03:40.730 --> 00:03:42.320 align:middle line:10%
So we started here,
so we could see

00:03:42.320 --> 00:03:45.110 align:middle line:10%
the differences between some
of these interesting fruits.

00:03:45.110 --> 00:03:47.002 align:middle line:10%
These are all raw
fruits, just sliced.

00:03:47.002 --> 00:03:48.710 align:middle line:10%
The mushroom you can
see was just sliced,

00:03:48.710 --> 00:03:50.600 align:middle line:10%
like a portobello
mushroom sliced.

00:03:50.600 --> 00:03:52.730 align:middle line:84%
Nettle leaf, just
pushed on the plate.

00:03:52.730 --> 00:03:55.910 align:middle line:84%
And you can see the energy of
fresh, raw, and living food.

00:03:55.910 --> 00:03:59.330 align:middle line:84%
And you can see how bright
it is, electrical it is.

00:03:59.330 --> 00:04:01.400 align:middle line:84%
And this is the thing
about raw and living foods.

00:04:01.400 --> 00:04:04.640 align:middle line:10%
They increase your electricity,
your vital electricity,

00:04:04.640 --> 00:04:07.230 align:middle line:10%
and immediate ability
to metabolize food,

00:04:07.230 --> 00:04:08.030 align:middle line:10%
because it's fresh.

00:04:08.030 --> 00:04:08.390 align:middle line:90%
It's raw.

00:04:08.390 --> 00:04:09.190 align:middle line:90%
It's original.

00:04:09.190 --> 00:04:12.230 align:middle line:90%
It's the way it was meant to be.

00:04:12.230 --> 00:04:14.240 align:middle line:10%
On the left right
here, you're going

00:04:14.240 --> 00:04:17.180 align:middle line:10%
to see a real cabbage,
a raw cabbage.

00:04:17.180 --> 00:04:20.000 align:middle line:10%
Just take the chunk
out like that.

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:21.149 align:middle line:10%
That's what that is.

00:04:21.149 --> 00:04:22.640 align:middle line:10%
And then right next to
it is that same piece

00:04:22.640 --> 00:04:23.440 align:middle line:10%
of cabbage cooked.

00:04:23.440 --> 00:04:25.910 align:middle line:10%


00:04:25.910 --> 00:04:29.902 align:middle line:10%
Slight difference
there, energetically.

00:04:29.902 --> 00:04:31.610 align:middle line:10%
And then right here,
this is interesting.

00:04:31.610 --> 00:04:34.413 align:middle line:10%
So on one side,
you've got olive oil.

00:04:34.413 --> 00:04:35.330 align:middle line:10%
That's your left side.

00:04:35.330 --> 00:04:36.997 align:middle line:10%
And then over on the
other side is lard.

00:04:36.997 --> 00:04:40.180 align:middle line:90%


00:04:40.180 --> 00:04:41.688 align:middle line:10%
Slight diminishment in energy.

00:04:41.688 --> 00:04:43.480 align:middle line:10%
Now, there's quite a
lot of energy in lard.

00:04:43.480 --> 00:04:45.610 align:middle line:10%
I mean, we ran for
years in this country,

00:04:45.610 --> 00:04:50.380 align:middle line:10%
we drove across the country
back and forth on biodiesel,

00:04:50.380 --> 00:04:52.060 align:middle line:10%
on grease.

00:04:52.060 --> 00:04:54.760 align:middle line:10%
We would drive up behind
Chinese restaurants,

00:04:54.760 --> 00:04:56.770 align:middle line:10%
we would open up
the grease trap,

00:04:56.770 --> 00:04:58.810 align:middle line:10%
we'd put our pumps
in there, and we'd

00:04:58.810 --> 00:05:00.967 align:middle line:10%
start pumping the grease out.

00:05:00.967 --> 00:05:03.550 align:middle line:84%
And then we'd filter it down to
20 microns, then in 5 microns,

00:05:03.550 --> 00:05:05.050 align:middle line:90%
and go right into the engine.

00:05:05.050 --> 00:05:09.070 align:middle line:84%
We had two 50 gallon-- we
had a 50 gallon tank and 250

00:05:09.070 --> 00:05:13.825 align:middle line:84%
gallon tanks, and we'd fill
those up, and we'd drive off.

00:05:13.825 --> 00:05:14.950 align:middle line:90%
It was the best thing ever.

00:05:14.950 --> 00:05:16.000 align:middle line:84%
They didn't know
what was going on.

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:16.600 align:middle line:90%
They would look at us.

00:05:16.600 --> 00:05:18.183 align:middle line:84%
They'd come out in
the back and they'd

00:05:18.183 --> 00:05:20.307 align:middle line:90%
be like, what's going on?

00:05:20.307 --> 00:05:21.640 align:middle line:90%
They'd start smoking cigarettes.

00:05:21.640 --> 00:05:23.610 align:middle line:90%
We're just in our grease suits.

00:05:23.610 --> 00:05:25.400 align:middle line:84%
We had these things,
it was like--

00:05:25.400 --> 00:05:26.880 align:middle line:90%
you ever see the movie "Brazil"?

00:05:26.880 --> 00:05:27.680 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:05:27.680 --> 00:05:29.710 align:middle line:84%
>> OK, remember how the
plumber has to like,

00:05:29.710 --> 00:05:32.620 align:middle line:84%
break in through the window to
save the plumbing and then get

00:05:32.620 --> 00:05:35.600 align:middle line:84%
out of there before the
government plumbers show up?

00:05:35.600 --> 00:05:37.930 align:middle line:84%
It was like that, where
we'd be in our grease suits,

00:05:37.930 --> 00:05:40.600 align:middle line:84%
and before the
landfill people come

00:05:40.600 --> 00:05:45.340 align:middle line:84%
and take that grease, which
can be used to run at least 11%

00:05:45.340 --> 00:05:47.980 align:middle line:84%
of the shipping fleet
in America today,

00:05:47.980 --> 00:05:52.345 align:middle line:84%
currently could be run on
grease that we're throwing away.

00:05:52.345 --> 00:05:56.110 align:middle line:90%


00:05:56.110 --> 00:05:57.340 align:middle line:90%
It's crazy, isn't it?

00:05:57.340 --> 00:05:59.320 align:middle line:84%
It's just the
craziest thing ever.

00:05:59.320 --> 00:06:02.530 align:middle line:84%
And so we had to like,
basically-- now today,

00:06:02.530 --> 00:06:06.280 align:middle line:84%
all the grease traps are locked,
so you can't get in there,

00:06:06.280 --> 00:06:08.830 align:middle line:84%
because we can't have anybody
running around these freeways

00:06:08.830 --> 00:06:10.300 align:middle line:90%
for free.

00:06:10.300 --> 00:06:11.620 align:middle line:90%
I mean, in a free country?

00:06:11.620 --> 00:06:14.290 align:middle line:90%
That would be crazy.

00:06:14.290 --> 00:06:16.480 align:middle line:84%
But back in the day, we
could still get in there.

00:06:16.480 --> 00:06:18.940 align:middle line:84%
We'd put our pumps in
there, pump that stuff out.

00:06:18.940 --> 00:06:21.850 align:middle line:84%
And the vehicle would
smell like French fries.

00:06:21.850 --> 00:06:22.780 align:middle line:90%
It was the best ever.

00:06:22.780 --> 00:06:25.300 align:middle line:84%
So we're a raw food bus driving
down the freeway smelling

00:06:25.300 --> 00:06:26.760 align:middle line:90%
like French fries.

00:06:26.760 --> 00:06:30.340 align:middle line:84%
It was really good,
really good times.

00:06:30.340 --> 00:06:33.213 align:middle line:84%
So lard still has
some energy in it.

00:06:33.213 --> 00:06:35.755 align:middle line:10%
Right here, you can see muesli
on the left and Kellogg's Corn

00:06:35.755 --> 00:06:37.792 align:middle line:10%
Flakes on the right.

00:06:37.792 --> 00:06:39.250 align:middle line:84%
You can't even see
the Corn Flakes.

00:06:39.250 --> 00:06:42.610 align:middle line:84%
They disappeared,
energetically disappeared.

00:06:42.610 --> 00:06:44.667 align:middle line:90%
Nothing is left.

00:06:44.667 --> 00:06:46.750 align:middle line:84%
And this is kind of what
we're dealing with today.

00:06:46.750 --> 00:06:48.700 align:middle line:84%
The food really
is not even there.

00:06:48.700 --> 00:06:49.690 align:middle line:90%
It just disappeared.

00:06:49.690 --> 00:06:50.680 align:middle line:90%
It got cooked to death.

00:06:50.680 --> 00:06:55.630 align:middle line:90%


00:06:55.630 --> 00:06:58.890 align:middle line:10%
These are two sets of hands
on a plate, like this.

00:06:58.890 --> 00:07:01.680 align:middle line:10%
You can see that, boom,
there's the hands on the plate.

00:07:01.680 --> 00:07:03.030 align:middle line:90%
One live food diet.

00:07:03.030 --> 00:07:05.460 align:middle line:84%
The other right
there, junk food diet.

00:07:05.460 --> 00:07:07.783 align:middle line:10%
So just a slight
energetic discrepancy.

00:07:07.783 --> 00:07:08.700 align:middle line:10%
And we could see that.

00:07:08.700 --> 00:07:10.180 align:middle line:10%
We know that that's
what's going on, right?

00:07:10.180 --> 00:07:12.120 align:middle line:10%
We can see what junk
food does to people.

00:07:12.120 --> 00:07:15.150 align:middle line:10%
But there's a major energetic
and vibrational discrepancy.

00:07:15.150 --> 00:07:18.330 align:middle line:84%
So when somebody starts to
argue with me about science,

00:07:18.330 --> 00:07:21.645 align:middle line:84%
and they're on junk
food, it's like, whoa.

00:07:21.645 --> 00:07:24.187 align:middle line:90%


00:07:24.187 --> 00:07:25.770 align:middle line:84%
This is a theme I'm
going to get into.

00:07:25.770 --> 00:07:27.562 align:middle line:84%
It's one of my favorite
themes to get into,

00:07:27.562 --> 00:07:31.560 align:middle line:84%
because it's really bringing up
a very touchy and very sizzling

00:07:31.560 --> 00:07:35.160 align:middle line:84%
point right now, which is
we're all sold and defaulted

00:07:35.160 --> 00:07:37.350 align:middle line:90%
into scientism.

00:07:37.350 --> 00:07:40.333 align:middle line:84%
That's our default
religion, right?

00:07:40.333 --> 00:07:42.000 align:middle line:84%
Scientism says this
is what's above you.

00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:42.630 align:middle line:90%
This is what's before you.

00:07:42.630 --> 00:07:43.500 align:middle line:90%
Here's how the Earth started.

00:07:43.500 --> 00:07:44.220 align:middle line:90%
Here's how it ended.

00:07:44.220 --> 00:07:45.810 align:middle line:84%
Here's the whole-- this is
the whole story, the Big

00:07:45.810 --> 00:07:46.950 align:middle line:90%
Bang, all this other stuff.

00:07:46.950 --> 00:07:48.810 align:middle line:90%
It's all theoretical.

00:07:48.810 --> 00:07:51.180 align:middle line:90%
It's sold to us as a fact.

00:07:51.180 --> 00:07:53.810 align:middle line:84%
The theory of evolution
is absolutely theoretical.

00:07:53.810 --> 00:07:56.580 align:middle line:84%
All the evidence against it
is excluded from our reality.

00:07:56.580 --> 00:07:58.223 align:middle line:90%
We're not allowed to see it.

00:07:58.223 --> 00:08:00.390 align:middle line:84%
That's why I hunted down
Michael Cremo and his book,

00:08:00.390 --> 00:08:01.830 align:middle line:90%
"Forbidden Archeology".

00:08:01.830 --> 00:08:03.960 align:middle line:84%
That's why I'm friends
with Konstantin Korotkov,

00:08:03.960 --> 00:08:06.120 align:middle line:84%
and his work on the
Peruvian mummies,

00:08:06.120 --> 00:08:07.830 align:middle line:84%
and what's going on
with our realization

00:08:07.830 --> 00:08:09.510 align:middle line:84%
that this Earth
has always produced

00:08:09.510 --> 00:08:10.862 align:middle line:90%
humanoid type of beings.

00:08:10.862 --> 00:08:13.320 align:middle line:84%
And many of them have succeeded
in producing civilizations.

00:08:13.320 --> 00:08:15.570 align:middle line:84%
And this has been going on
since the beginning of time

00:08:15.570 --> 00:08:16.590 align:middle line:90%
on this Earth.

00:08:16.590 --> 00:08:19.530 align:middle line:84%
And so the Peruvian mummies
with the three fingers,

00:08:19.530 --> 00:08:23.040 align:middle line:84%
and there's hundreds
of them, and scientism

00:08:23.040 --> 00:08:25.530 align:middle line:84%
is going to go, we've
got to get rid of this,

00:08:25.530 --> 00:08:27.120 align:middle line:84%
because this
violates our theory.

00:08:27.120 --> 00:08:28.700 align:middle line:90%
We can't have that.

00:08:28.700 --> 00:08:30.820 align:middle line:84%
We've got to get
rid of the evidence.

00:08:30.820 --> 00:08:32.340 align:middle line:90%
This is what scientism is.

00:08:32.340 --> 00:08:36.179 align:middle line:84%
So it's using science
as a masquerade

00:08:36.179 --> 00:08:40.024 align:middle line:84%
to disguise a false
narrative of reality.

00:08:40.024 --> 00:08:42.850 align:middle line:90%


00:08:42.850 --> 00:08:46.350 align:middle line:84%
So the theory of evolution
is an absolutely absurd

00:08:46.350 --> 00:08:48.720 align:middle line:84%
false narrative
of reality that's

00:08:48.720 --> 00:08:50.737 align:middle line:84%
this little tiny little
sliver right here.

00:08:50.737 --> 00:08:52.320 align:middle line:84%
Don't look at this
evidence over here.

00:08:52.320 --> 00:08:53.640 align:middle line:90%
We can't be having that.

00:08:53.640 --> 00:08:55.140 align:middle line:84%
We don't want you
to look over here,

00:08:55.140 --> 00:08:58.032 align:middle line:84%
because that would violate
this, and we don't want that.

00:08:58.032 --> 00:08:59.490 align:middle line:84%
It could change
our belief systems.

00:08:59.490 --> 00:09:02.322 align:middle line:84%
That would be the
worst thing ever.

00:09:02.322 --> 00:09:05.610 align:middle line:84%
Could you imagine if we had
to change our belief system?

00:09:05.610 --> 00:09:10.078 align:middle line:90%
My god, devastating.

00:09:10.078 --> 00:09:11.620 align:middle line:84%
And this is what
people are clutching

00:09:11.620 --> 00:09:13.995 align:middle line:84%
onto with desperation, with
all their heart, because it's

00:09:13.995 --> 00:09:16.300 align:middle line:90%
a religious position.

00:09:16.300 --> 00:09:18.520 align:middle line:84%
Their belief system is
their religious position.

00:09:18.520 --> 00:09:22.030 align:middle line:84%
Please, please, please don't
disturb my religious position.

00:09:22.030 --> 00:09:23.260 align:middle line:90%
Is this making sense?

00:09:23.260 --> 00:09:25.030 align:middle line:84%
It will make sense, because I'll
keep hitting this button over

00:09:25.030 --> 00:09:26.190 align:middle line:90%
and over again.

00:09:26.190 --> 00:09:28.000 align:middle line:84%
This is what's
going on with food.

00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:29.225 align:middle line:90%
It's like, don't disturb my--

00:09:29.225 --> 00:09:30.850 align:middle line:84%
I can't-- I don't
want to look at that,

00:09:30.850 --> 00:09:33.017 align:middle line:84%
because then I might have
to change what I'm eating,

00:09:33.017 --> 00:09:34.510 align:middle line:90%
and we can't be having that.

00:09:34.510 --> 00:09:36.343 align:middle line:84%
We can't be having
anybody actually changing

00:09:36.343 --> 00:09:40.050 align:middle line:90%
their mind, right?

00:09:40.050 --> 00:09:41.850 align:middle line:84%
That would be too
much, and we'd better

00:09:41.850 --> 00:09:45.790 align:middle line:84%
go back to our safe
little position of this.

00:09:45.790 --> 00:09:47.390 align:middle line:90%
We thought we got rid of this.

00:09:47.390 --> 00:09:48.190 align:middle line:90%
Remember?

00:09:48.190 --> 00:09:50.110 align:middle line:84%
The Enlightenment,
scientific era.

00:09:50.110 --> 00:09:51.340 align:middle line:90%
We got rid of this.

00:09:51.340 --> 00:09:53.230 align:middle line:84%
We have not gotten
rid of anything.

00:09:53.230 --> 00:09:57.490 align:middle line:84%
This just went from
this to this now.

00:09:57.490 --> 00:09:59.825 align:middle line:90%
That's all that happened.

00:09:59.825 --> 00:10:02.200 align:middle line:84%
And if you don't believe that,
why don't you just present

00:10:02.200 --> 00:10:03.367 align:middle line:90%
evidence as I've been doing?

00:10:03.367 --> 00:10:05.440 align:middle line:84%
Like the Paluxy
River find in Texas,

00:10:05.440 --> 00:10:07.690 align:middle line:84%
where there's dinosaur
footprints and human footprints

00:10:07.690 --> 00:10:09.820 align:middle line:90%
together in the same strata.

00:10:09.820 --> 00:10:13.090 align:middle line:90%


00:10:13.090 --> 00:10:14.457 align:middle line:90%
Did you ever hear about that?

00:10:14.457 --> 00:10:16.540 align:middle line:84%
Do you want to know why
you never hear about that?

00:10:16.540 --> 00:10:17.830 align:middle line:84%
You've probably heard
about it. if You're really

00:10:17.830 --> 00:10:20.247 align:middle line:84%
an investigator of this, you've
looked at, you've seen it,

00:10:20.247 --> 00:10:21.505 align:middle line:90%
you've read about it.

00:10:21.505 --> 00:10:23.380 align:middle line:84%
You want to know why
you never hear about it?

00:10:23.380 --> 00:10:26.650 align:middle line:84%
Because it violates every
part of our little theory,

00:10:26.650 --> 00:10:29.650 align:middle line:84%
and we can't be having any
violation of our theory.

00:10:29.650 --> 00:10:32.702 align:middle line:90%
That would be terrible.

00:10:32.702 --> 00:10:34.410 align:middle line:84%
So more and more and
more are finding out

00:10:34.410 --> 00:10:37.110 align:middle line:84%
that these giant
Acrocanthosaurus,

00:10:37.110 --> 00:10:39.090 align:middle line:84%
giant flightless birds,
whatever they were,

00:10:39.090 --> 00:10:41.880 align:middle line:84%
that left these tracks
were living with humans,

00:10:41.880 --> 00:10:44.190 align:middle line:90%
and always lived with humans.

00:10:44.190 --> 00:10:47.550 align:middle line:84%
Or another way of saying it,
god forbid that I say this,

00:10:47.550 --> 00:10:50.880 align:middle line:84%
this would be
absolutely heresy today,

00:10:50.880 --> 00:10:54.450 align:middle line:84%
scientism heresy, dinosaurs and
humans lived at the same time,

00:10:54.450 --> 00:10:57.290 align:middle line:90%
and they always have.

00:10:57.290 --> 00:11:00.020 align:middle line:84%
Right over here at Cal Poly
Pomona, one of the research

00:11:00.020 --> 00:11:03.200 align:middle line:84%
scientists over there,
20 peer-reviewed papers,

00:11:03.200 --> 00:11:06.500 align:middle line:84%
his scientific credentials
can't be questioned,

00:11:06.500 --> 00:11:10.400 align:middle line:84%
he had a triceratops
horn that he

00:11:10.400 --> 00:11:12.860 align:middle line:90%
had dated to 3,500 years ago.

00:11:12.860 --> 00:11:14.720 align:middle line:84%
Well, that doesn't
fit the narrative,

00:11:14.720 --> 00:11:16.200 align:middle line:90%
and that can't be existing.

00:11:16.200 --> 00:11:17.658 align:middle line:84%
And so we've got
to get rid of him.

00:11:17.658 --> 00:11:18.750 align:middle line:90%
So they fired him.

00:11:18.750 --> 00:11:21.920 align:middle line:90%
He sued Cal Poly Pomona and won.

00:11:21.920 --> 00:11:23.422 align:middle line:90%
And won.

00:11:23.422 --> 00:11:25.090 align:middle line:90%
Did you ever hear about that?

00:11:25.090 --> 00:11:26.280 align:middle line:90%
Of course not.

00:11:26.280 --> 00:11:27.370 align:middle line:84%
No, that violates
our little theory.

00:11:27.370 --> 00:11:28.420 align:middle line:90%
We've got to get rid of him.

00:11:28.420 --> 00:11:29.330 align:middle line:84%
We'll get rid of
all the evidence.

00:11:29.330 --> 00:11:30.700 align:middle line:84%
We'll just-- we
don't look at it.

00:11:30.700 --> 00:11:31.500 align:middle line:90%
He's a weirdo.

00:11:31.500 --> 00:11:35.170 align:middle line:90%


00:11:35.170 --> 00:11:39.970 align:middle line:84%
The real story is much more
magical, much better, much

00:11:39.970 --> 00:11:44.470 align:middle line:84%
more interesting than
this in every field.

00:11:44.470 --> 00:11:47.500 align:middle line:84%
But the scientism is
just another religious

00:11:47.500 --> 00:11:50.440 align:middle line:84%
fundamentalism that's
trying to drive you

00:11:50.440 --> 00:11:54.430 align:middle line:84%
into a materialistic nightmare
where all magic is removed,

00:11:54.430 --> 00:11:56.650 align:middle line:84%
and you're bought
into an absurd theory

00:11:56.650 --> 00:11:58.570 align:middle line:84%
like the theory of
evolution and the millions

00:11:58.570 --> 00:12:00.370 align:middle line:84%
and millions of years
nonsense, and it just

00:12:00.370 --> 00:12:01.720 align:middle line:90%
goes on and on and on.

00:12:01.720 --> 00:12:03.430 align:middle line:84%
Then we go, well,
what's the alternative?

00:12:03.430 --> 00:12:05.290 align:middle line:90%
It's got to be then creationism.

00:12:05.290 --> 00:12:06.340 align:middle line:90%
That's all we get?

00:12:06.340 --> 00:12:07.840 align:middle line:90%
One or the other?

00:12:07.840 --> 00:12:10.090 align:middle line:90%
That's all we get.

00:12:10.090 --> 00:12:12.580 align:middle line:84%
So they're selling you, either
it's this fundamentalism,

00:12:12.580 --> 00:12:16.137 align:middle line:90%
this over here, or this one.

00:12:16.137 --> 00:12:17.220 align:middle line:90%
And I've got news for you.

00:12:17.220 --> 00:12:19.175 align:middle line:84%
It's neither, unfortunately,
for all of us.

00:12:19.175 --> 00:12:21.300 align:middle line:84%
And we're going to have to
change our mind, I know,

00:12:21.300 --> 00:12:22.920 align:middle line:90%
it's horrible.

00:12:22.920 --> 00:12:25.215 align:middle line:90%
Who would want to do that?

00:12:25.215 --> 00:12:26.185 align:middle line:90%
I don't know.

00:12:26.185 --> 00:12:29.590 align:middle line:90%


00:12:29.590 --> 00:12:32.370 align:middle line:90%
Aloe vera.

00:12:32.370 --> 00:12:36.040 align:middle line:84%
There's a dinosaur
plant right there.

00:12:36.040 --> 00:12:38.440 align:middle line:84%
Aloe vera, the aloe vera
grown right in your garden,

00:12:38.440 --> 00:12:43.240 align:middle line:84%
you need to eat
that, absolutely.

00:12:43.240 --> 00:12:44.050 align:middle line:90%
Now, you fillet it.

00:12:44.050 --> 00:12:46.060 align:middle line:84%
If you eat the
skin of aloe vera,

00:12:46.060 --> 00:12:47.890 align:middle line:84%
it doesn't taste very
good, but it really

00:12:47.890 --> 00:12:52.790 align:middle line:84%
is going to have a laxative
effect, which we might need,

00:12:52.790 --> 00:12:59.430 align:middle line:90%
because we're full of asparagus.

00:12:59.430 --> 00:13:02.660 align:middle line:90%
How do we feel about asparagus?

00:13:02.660 --> 00:13:04.058 align:middle line:10%
Not the best ever.

00:13:04.058 --> 00:13:05.350 align:middle line:10%
What's going on with asparagus?

00:13:05.350 --> 00:13:07.900 align:middle line:10%
Asparagus is one of the most
unique plants in the world,

00:13:07.900 --> 00:13:11.590 align:middle line:10%
because it's halfway
between a plant and a fern.

00:13:11.590 --> 00:13:14.230 align:middle line:10%
So it's kind of the
halfway from the ferns

00:13:14.230 --> 00:13:18.040 align:middle line:10%
into the flowering
and fruiting plants.

00:13:18.040 --> 00:13:22.000 align:middle line:10%
And asparagus is able to
survive very harsh conditions,

00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:24.760 align:middle line:10%
because it forms a
little bulbous roots.

00:13:24.760 --> 00:13:27.550 align:middle line:10%
And those bulbous roots
are amazing for us.

00:13:27.550 --> 00:13:31.270 align:middle line:10%
They're one of the top 10
herbs in Chinese medicine

00:13:31.270 --> 00:13:33.970 align:middle line:10%
and Ayurvedic medicine.

00:13:33.970 --> 00:13:37.990 align:middle line:84%
The root of the asparagus,
that's a trip, isn't it?

00:13:37.990 --> 00:13:41.110 align:middle line:84%
I always thought, oh,
OK, it's asparagus.

00:13:41.110 --> 00:13:42.250 align:middle line:90%
That's a really good food.

00:13:42.250 --> 00:13:43.150 align:middle line:90%
What a great food.

00:13:43.150 --> 00:13:45.580 align:middle line:90%
But the root is even better.

00:13:45.580 --> 00:13:49.020 align:middle line:84%
And the root is like ooey gooey
rich and chewy on the inside.

00:13:49.020 --> 00:13:51.640 align:middle line:90%


00:13:51.640 --> 00:13:54.070 align:middle line:84%
Slap it all together,
and it's good for you.

00:13:54.070 --> 00:13:57.560 align:middle line:90%
It's the asparagus root newton.

00:13:57.560 --> 00:14:02.200 align:middle line:90%


00:14:02.200 --> 00:14:05.228 align:middle line:10%
Do we know what this means?

00:14:05.228 --> 00:14:07.270 align:middle line:10%
At the end of this, you're
going to be like this.

00:14:07.270 --> 00:14:08.575 align:middle line:10%
[BLUBBERING]

00:14:08.575 --> 00:14:09.760 align:middle line:10%


00:14:09.760 --> 00:14:14.530 align:middle line:10%
He said something about
[INHALES] avocados.

00:14:14.530 --> 00:14:17.165 align:middle line:10%
[LAUGHTER]

00:14:17.165 --> 00:14:17.965 align:middle line:90%
Broccoli.

00:14:17.965 --> 00:14:21.370 align:middle line:90%


00:14:21.370 --> 00:14:25.090 align:middle line:84%
That's one speck
of cacao powder.

00:14:25.090 --> 00:14:32.040 align:middle line:84%
That's a little speck of cacao
powder, chocolate powder.

00:14:32.040 --> 00:14:34.122 align:middle line:90%
This is a raw chocolate powder.

00:14:34.122 --> 00:14:36.080 align:middle line:84%
I remember when I sent
this in, I was like, OK,

00:14:36.080 --> 00:14:39.030 align:middle line:84%
this is one of our first samples
of raw chocolate powder ever.

00:14:39.030 --> 00:14:39.895 align:middle line:90%
We invented that.

00:14:39.895 --> 00:14:40.820 align:middle line:90%
I put that on the market.

00:14:40.820 --> 00:14:42.230 align:middle line:84%
I don't know if you
know that about me.

00:14:42.230 --> 00:14:43.030 align:middle line:90%
I put coconut oil--

00:14:43.030 --> 00:14:46.310 align:middle line:84%
I was the first person to put
coconut oil on the internet.

00:14:46.310 --> 00:14:49.940 align:middle line:84%
We had the first raw food
website on the internet.

00:14:49.940 --> 00:14:52.310 align:middle line:84%
We had the first raw food
store on the internet.

00:14:52.310 --> 00:14:54.810 align:middle line:84%
We had the first super
food store on the internet.

00:14:54.810 --> 00:14:59.840 align:middle line:90%
This is back 1994, '95, '96.

00:14:59.840 --> 00:15:03.380 align:middle line:84%
We were starting just
when Amazon was starting.

00:15:03.380 --> 00:15:05.202 align:middle line:84%
So I had all Ann
Wigmore's books.

00:15:05.202 --> 00:15:06.410 align:middle line:90%
I had all the raw food books.

00:15:06.410 --> 00:15:07.220 align:middle line:90%
Every one, right?

00:15:07.220 --> 00:15:09.770 align:middle line:84%
All the amazing stuff, all
the Gabriel Cousens books.

00:15:09.770 --> 00:15:12.980 align:middle line:84%
And our main competitor
back then was?

00:15:12.980 --> 00:15:15.150 align:middle line:90%
Amazon.

00:15:15.150 --> 00:15:16.740 align:middle line:90%
Back then, yes.

00:15:16.740 --> 00:15:17.992 align:middle line:90%
Yep, way back then.

00:15:17.992 --> 00:15:19.950 align:middle line:10%
The first thing I ever
ordered off the internet

00:15:19.950 --> 00:15:22.550 align:middle line:10%
was off of Amazon in 1994.

00:15:22.550 --> 00:15:23.800 align:middle line:90%
That's when I started with it.

00:15:23.800 --> 00:15:25.505 align:middle line:84%
That's when the
internet really began.

00:15:25.505 --> 00:15:27.630 align:middle line:84%
But today, it's a totally
different game, isn't it?

00:15:27.630 --> 00:15:29.963 align:middle line:84%
It's very interesting what's
happened with the internet.

00:15:29.963 --> 00:15:31.860 align:middle line:84%
Now we've got these
huge monopolies

00:15:31.860 --> 00:15:34.320 align:middle line:84%
that are trying to control
the narrative, right?

00:15:34.320 --> 00:15:36.450 align:middle line:84%
And the narrative has to
be controlled, doesn't it?

00:15:36.450 --> 00:15:38.250 align:middle line:84%
I mean, we can't have people
thinking for themselves.

00:15:38.250 --> 00:15:39.360 align:middle line:90%
That would-- forget that.

00:15:39.360 --> 00:15:40.160 align:middle line:90%
That's terrible.

00:15:40.160 --> 00:15:42.660 align:middle line:90%


00:15:42.660 --> 00:15:44.770 align:middle line:90%
I love being sarcastic.

00:15:44.770 --> 00:15:45.570 align:middle line:90%
The absurdity.

00:15:45.570 --> 00:15:48.860 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I was deleted off of
YouTube, 10 years of work,

00:15:48.860 --> 00:15:52.110 align:middle line:84%
10 years of videos and
work, for no reason,

00:15:52.110 --> 00:15:53.860 align:middle line:84%
with no strikes, no
warnings, or anything.

00:15:53.860 --> 00:15:55.985 align:middle line:84%
Just one day I came to my
page, and they deleted it

00:15:55.985 --> 00:15:57.140 align:middle line:90%
with no appeal.

00:15:57.140 --> 00:15:57.945 align:middle line:90%
No appeal.

00:15:57.945 --> 00:15:58.820 align:middle line:90%
I tried to appeal it.

00:15:58.820 --> 00:16:00.980 align:middle line:90%
They said you can't appeal it.

00:16:00.980 --> 00:16:02.435 align:middle line:90%
Now, why would they do that?

00:16:02.435 --> 00:16:04.310 align:middle line:84%
Why would they just
delete me off of YouTube?

00:16:04.310 --> 00:16:05.110 align:middle line:90%
What do you think?

00:16:05.110 --> 00:16:08.540 align:middle line:90%


00:16:08.540 --> 00:16:10.971 align:middle line:84%
>> Keep people thinking the
same stuff that they're--

00:16:10.971 --> 00:16:13.096 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, you are lucky that
you're alive right now.

00:16:13.096 --> 00:16:16.870 align:middle line:90%


00:16:16.870 --> 00:16:17.900 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, yeah, no.

00:16:17.900 --> 00:16:19.580 align:middle line:84%
I've had death
threats against me.

00:16:19.580 --> 00:16:21.890 align:middle line:84%
In fact, I had two people
kicked off of Twitter years

00:16:21.890 --> 00:16:23.990 align:middle line:90%
ago for threatening to kill me.

00:16:23.990 --> 00:16:26.000 align:middle line:84%
Like, overtly, just
right on Twitter.

00:16:26.000 --> 00:16:27.980 align:middle line:84%
I was like, I reported
it to Twitter,

00:16:27.980 --> 00:16:29.870 align:middle line:90%
and they removed them, actually.

00:16:29.870 --> 00:16:33.620 align:middle line:84%
I mean, shockingly,
I have to tell you.

00:16:33.620 --> 00:16:36.543 align:middle line:84%
I was in an airport in Houston,
and on the way out of Houston,

00:16:36.543 --> 00:16:38.960 align:middle line:84%
we were having a wonderful
time in Houston, and on the way

00:16:38.960 --> 00:16:41.158 align:middle line:84%
out, the gal who
was working at the--

00:16:41.158 --> 00:16:43.700 align:middle line:84%
the cashier, one of the cashiers
at one of the little stores,

00:16:43.700 --> 00:16:45.912 align:middle line:84%
she wanted to follow
me on Facebook.

00:16:45.912 --> 00:16:47.870 align:middle line:84%
And I was like, oh, just
punch in David Avocado

00:16:47.870 --> 00:16:50.152 align:middle line:84%
Wolfe on Facebook
on her phone, right?

00:16:50.152 --> 00:16:51.110 align:middle line:90%
And it was interesting.

00:16:51.110 --> 00:16:52.010 align:middle line:90%
They've got me shadow banned.

00:16:52.010 --> 00:16:53.760 align:middle line:84%
I've got 12 million
followers on Facebook,

00:16:53.760 --> 00:16:56.090 align:middle line:84%
but they still have
me shadow banned.

00:16:56.090 --> 00:16:57.050 align:middle line:90%
And I was like, what--

00:16:57.050 --> 00:16:58.800 align:middle line:84%
I couldn't-- because
she couldn't find me.

00:16:58.800 --> 00:17:00.890 align:middle line:84%
So it took us a
minute to find me.

00:17:00.890 --> 00:17:03.890 align:middle line:84%
One of the sites that came
up before I even came up

00:17:03.890 --> 00:17:07.185 align:middle line:84%
was a site called "I will
kill David Wolfe" on Facebook.

00:17:07.185 --> 00:17:08.060 align:middle line:90%
I'm not even kidding.

00:17:08.060 --> 00:17:08.810 align:middle line:90%
Look that up.

00:17:08.810 --> 00:17:09.859 align:middle line:90%
Look that up on Facebook.

00:17:09.859 --> 00:17:10.670 align:middle line:90%
Report that site.

00:17:10.670 --> 00:17:12.890 align:middle line:90%
I'm reporting it.

00:17:12.890 --> 00:17:15.450 align:middle line:84%
I couldn't-- before I could
even find my own site,

00:17:15.450 --> 00:17:17.359 align:middle line:90%
which has 12 million followers.

00:17:17.359 --> 00:17:18.710 align:middle line:90%
Think about what that means.

00:17:18.710 --> 00:17:22.750 align:middle line:90%


00:17:22.750 --> 00:17:24.460 align:middle line:90%
I was like, whoa.

00:17:24.460 --> 00:17:28.630 align:middle line:90%
Couldn't find me on Facebook?

00:17:28.630 --> 00:17:29.950 align:middle line:90%
Crazy.

00:17:29.950 --> 00:17:33.040 align:middle line:90%
This is an Incan berry.

00:17:33.040 --> 00:17:34.570 align:middle line:90%
You guys know the Incan berry?

00:17:34.570 --> 00:17:38.470 align:middle line:84%
Physalis peruviana,
or the golden berry.

00:17:38.470 --> 00:17:41.500 align:middle line:84%
If you ever see that name,
Incan berry, on a product--

00:17:41.500 --> 00:17:42.730 align:middle line:90%
anybody ever seen that name?

00:17:42.730 --> 00:17:43.660 align:middle line:90%
You know what I'm talking about?

00:17:43.660 --> 00:17:44.500 align:middle line:90%
I made that name up.

00:17:44.500 --> 00:17:47.793 align:middle line:90%


00:17:47.793 --> 00:17:49.960 align:middle line:84%
And that was when we first
put that on the internet.

00:17:49.960 --> 00:17:52.090 align:middle line:84%
All of these things,
all the superfoods.

00:17:52.090 --> 00:17:57.310 align:middle line:84%
You name the superfoods,
lucuma, cacao, mucuna,

00:17:57.310 --> 00:17:59.530 align:middle line:84%
you name it, which--
well, name one.

00:17:59.530 --> 00:18:00.400 align:middle line:90%
Coconut oil.

00:18:00.400 --> 00:18:01.840 align:middle line:90%
>> Maca.

00:18:01.840 --> 00:18:03.100 align:middle line:90%
>> Maca.

00:18:03.100 --> 00:18:05.800 align:middle line:84%
I was the first person to
sell these on the internet.

00:18:05.800 --> 00:18:08.020 align:middle line:90%
That's how far back I go.

00:18:08.020 --> 00:18:10.292 align:middle line:84%
I remember getting my
first 25-pound bag of maca.

00:18:10.292 --> 00:18:11.500 align:middle line:90%
That's how we used to get it.

00:18:11.500 --> 00:18:13.910 align:middle line:84%
We used to get a 25-pound
bag of maca from Peru.

00:18:13.910 --> 00:18:17.920 align:middle line:90%
We were in Miami, and we were--

00:18:17.920 --> 00:18:19.170 align:middle line:90%
were you with us on that trip?

00:18:19.170 --> 00:18:19.970 align:middle line:90%
Maybe.

00:18:19.970 --> 00:18:22.630 align:middle line:84%
I don't know if
you were with us.

00:18:22.630 --> 00:18:24.440 align:middle line:84%
So this is the
craziest thing ever.

00:18:24.440 --> 00:18:26.628 align:middle line:84%
So I'm in Miami, and
we're having a few events.

00:18:26.628 --> 00:18:29.170 align:middle line:84%
And so we're literally trying
to get them into one-pound bags

00:18:29.170 --> 00:18:30.753 align:middle line:84%
and just selling
people one-pound bags

00:18:30.753 --> 00:18:33.430 align:middle line:90%
of maca for 20 bucks.

00:18:33.430 --> 00:18:34.990 align:middle line:90%
That was a good deal.

00:18:34.990 --> 00:18:36.485 align:middle line:90%
That's a great deal.

00:18:36.485 --> 00:18:38.860 align:middle line:84%
And we were going to this
place, this coconut place, that

00:18:38.860 --> 00:18:40.392 align:middle line:90%
had wonderful coconut water.

00:18:40.392 --> 00:18:42.100 align:middle line:84%
Way back then, there
was no coconut water

00:18:42.100 --> 00:18:43.870 align:middle line:90%
you could buy in a store.

00:18:43.870 --> 00:18:44.850 align:middle line:90%
This is 20 years ago.

00:18:44.850 --> 00:18:46.600 align:middle line:84%
No coconut water you
could buy in a store.

00:18:46.600 --> 00:18:47.080 align:middle line:90%
That's another thing.

00:18:47.080 --> 00:18:49.780 align:middle line:84%
We drove that so hard over
the years, finally now coconut

00:18:49.780 --> 00:18:51.100 align:middle line:90%
water is everywhere.

00:18:51.100 --> 00:18:57.018 align:middle line:84%
So we're driving this maca with
coconut drinks at our events.

00:18:57.018 --> 00:18:59.560 align:middle line:84%
And then next thing, people go,
OK, I'll get a pound of that.

00:18:59.560 --> 00:19:02.350 align:middle line:84%
And by the time we get to
Puerto Rico, we had about--

00:19:02.350 --> 00:19:04.730 align:middle line:84%
I don't know-- maybe
11 pounds left.

00:19:04.730 --> 00:19:06.353 align:middle line:84%
And so I had to,
by then, get them

00:19:06.353 --> 00:19:08.270 align:middle line:84%
into Ziploc bags that
were like one-pound size

00:19:08.270 --> 00:19:10.520 align:middle line:84%
so I could fit it into my
suitcase and get it through.

00:19:10.520 --> 00:19:14.350 align:middle line:84%
So I'm at the Miami airport, and
they pull me off to the side,

00:19:14.350 --> 00:19:16.120 align:middle line:90%
and the guy goes, open your bag.

00:19:16.120 --> 00:19:17.920 align:middle line:84%
And I go open the
bag, and there's

00:19:17.920 --> 00:19:22.630 align:middle line:84%
bags of maca,
one-pounders, in there.

00:19:22.630 --> 00:19:24.400 align:middle line:84%
Nobody knows what--
this is 20 years ago.

00:19:24.400 --> 00:19:25.780 align:middle line:90%
Nobody knows what maca is.

00:19:25.780 --> 00:19:28.450 align:middle line:84%
Right there, there's the
security guy, the border patrol

00:19:28.450 --> 00:19:30.970 align:middle line:84%
guy, the whole whatever,
customs, whatever.

00:19:30.970 --> 00:19:33.520 align:middle line:90%
He looks at it, and he goes, OK.

00:19:33.520 --> 00:19:36.040 align:middle line:84%
And I closed the thing, zip
it up, and I just went away.

00:19:36.040 --> 00:19:38.600 align:middle line:90%


00:19:38.600 --> 00:19:43.830 align:middle line:84%
And I was like, this guy's
in on it or something.

00:19:43.830 --> 00:19:44.910 align:middle line:90%
How did he just let me--

00:19:44.910 --> 00:19:47.460 align:middle line:84%
I mean, you know
what that looks like,

00:19:47.460 --> 00:19:50.010 align:middle line:84%
when you've got bags
of powder and you're

00:19:50.010 --> 00:19:51.400 align:middle line:90%
going to Puerto Rico.

00:19:51.400 --> 00:19:54.180 align:middle line:84%
I mean, and there he, is
looking at the whole thing,

00:19:54.180 --> 00:19:55.256 align:middle line:90%
oh it's fine.

00:19:55.256 --> 00:20:02.240 align:middle line:84%
And I was like, he's
getting a payoff, right?

00:20:02.240 --> 00:20:04.640 align:middle line:90%
Something, I don't know.

00:20:04.640 --> 00:20:06.352 align:middle line:90%
This is horsetail.

00:20:06.352 --> 00:20:08.240 align:middle line:10%
Do you guys know horsetail?

00:20:08.240 --> 00:20:09.590 align:middle line:90%
Equisetum.

00:20:09.590 --> 00:20:11.780 align:middle line:84%
Equisetum is really
important for broken bones,

00:20:11.780 --> 00:20:14.000 align:middle line:84%
really important for
bones and bone density.

00:20:14.000 --> 00:20:16.250 align:middle line:90%
Horsetail.

00:20:16.250 --> 00:20:17.100 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, hair.

00:20:17.100 --> 00:20:17.900 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:20:17.900 --> 00:20:19.220 align:middle line:90%
It's like hair, right?

00:20:19.220 --> 00:20:20.290 align:middle line:90%
Horsetail, it comes out.

00:20:20.290 --> 00:20:24.470 align:middle line:84%
You see how it comes out,
going every direction at once.

00:20:24.470 --> 00:20:28.190 align:middle line:84%
I don't have any Kirlian
photography of my hair, though.

00:20:28.190 --> 00:20:31.670 align:middle line:84%
Horsetail, very
interesting herb.

00:20:31.670 --> 00:20:34.255 align:middle line:84%
I had a gal, an Ann Wigmore
student, she's in her 80s.

00:20:34.255 --> 00:20:36.380 align:middle line:84%
This is something I just--
you've got to know this.

00:20:36.380 --> 00:20:37.790 align:middle line:90%
This is very important to know.

00:20:37.790 --> 00:20:39.710 align:middle line:84%
I come from a family
of medical doctors.

00:20:39.710 --> 00:20:41.270 align:middle line:84%
I know how to put people
back together when there's

00:20:41.270 --> 00:20:42.853 align:middle line:84%
broken bones, because
my dad taught me

00:20:42.853 --> 00:20:47.030 align:middle line:84%
when I was very young, without
plates, without screws,

00:20:47.030 --> 00:20:50.090 align:middle line:84%
without the hardware, without
all of this stuff that they're

00:20:50.090 --> 00:20:54.570 align:middle line:84%
putting into people, rods,
screws, plates, all this stuff.

00:20:54.570 --> 00:20:57.462 align:middle line:84%
So this gal, she came to one
of my events, and she's 80.

00:20:57.462 --> 00:20:58.670 align:middle line:90%
And she had broken her wrist.

00:20:58.670 --> 00:20:59.570 align:middle line:84%
And the doctors
are like, oh, we're

00:20:59.570 --> 00:21:02.390 align:middle line:84%
going to have to put this plate
in you, this rod, these screws.

00:21:02.390 --> 00:21:05.130 align:middle line:84%
She's looking at this
going, I'm 80 years old.

00:21:05.130 --> 00:21:05.930 align:middle line:90%
Forget it.

00:21:05.930 --> 00:21:06.730 align:middle line:90%
There's no way.

00:21:06.730 --> 00:21:07.580 align:middle line:90%
I'm not doing that.

00:21:07.580 --> 00:21:10.250 align:middle line:84%
And so instead she
remembered what Ann Wigmore

00:21:10.250 --> 00:21:14.393 align:middle line:84%
had told her, which is
immobilize your hand,

00:21:14.393 --> 00:21:16.310 align:middle line:84%
make sure the bones are
in the right position,

00:21:16.310 --> 00:21:18.503 align:middle line:84%
and then just get
on the horsetail.

00:21:18.503 --> 00:21:21.170 align:middle line:84%
And she said within three weeks,
her bones had basically healed.

00:21:21.170 --> 00:21:24.460 align:middle line:84%
Within six weeks, she had
motion back in her wrist.

00:21:24.460 --> 00:21:26.020 align:middle line:90%
She's 80.

00:21:26.020 --> 00:21:29.320 align:middle line:84%
This could have been a plate,
screws, rods, the whole thing.

00:21:29.320 --> 00:21:32.020 align:middle line:10%
So today, what they're trying
to do is they're trying to get--

00:21:32.020 --> 00:21:34.120 align:middle line:10%
this is the way they're
training doctors today.

00:21:34.120 --> 00:21:38.020 align:middle line:84%
Plates, screws,
rods, metal hardware.

00:21:38.020 --> 00:21:40.270 align:middle line:84%
So they're going to put
that all inside your body,

00:21:40.270 --> 00:21:42.550 align:middle line:84%
and then some time
later, and maybe

00:21:42.550 --> 00:21:44.920 align:middle line:84%
never, they're going
to take it all out.

00:21:44.920 --> 00:21:49.300 align:middle line:84%
And my dad, you never
did anything like that.

00:21:49.300 --> 00:21:51.117 align:middle line:84%
There might be a time
and place for that,

00:21:51.117 --> 00:21:52.700 align:middle line:84%
but I've got to tell
you-- like a gal,

00:21:52.700 --> 00:21:56.780 align:middle line:84%
she broke this bone right here,
one of my friends on Instagram.

00:21:56.780 --> 00:21:59.380 align:middle line:90%
She's from Melbourne, Australia.

00:21:59.380 --> 00:22:02.025 align:middle line:90%
And guess what they told her?

00:22:02.025 --> 00:22:04.150 align:middle line:84%
We've got to do this plate,
this screw, these rods,

00:22:04.150 --> 00:22:04.990 align:middle line:90%
this other thing, she sends me.

00:22:04.990 --> 00:22:06.160 align:middle line:90%
And I said, send me your X-ray.

00:22:06.160 --> 00:22:06.880 align:middle line:90%
She sends me an X-ray.

00:22:06.880 --> 00:22:08.560 align:middle line:84%
It's a simple break,
this finger right here.

00:22:08.560 --> 00:22:10.750 align:middle line:84%
I was like, just pull your
finger-- snap your finger

00:22:10.750 --> 00:22:12.730 align:middle line:84%
into place, get this
thing, I sent her

00:22:12.730 --> 00:22:14.890 align:middle line:84%
the exact thing she needed
to immobilize her wrist,

00:22:14.890 --> 00:22:18.070 align:middle line:84%
and just do the horsetail tea,
and you're going to be fine.

00:22:18.070 --> 00:22:20.980 align:middle line:84%
About three or four
weeks later, I see her

00:22:20.980 --> 00:22:23.050 align:middle line:84%
in a yoga class on
her Instagram stories,

00:22:23.050 --> 00:22:25.480 align:middle line:84%
and I was like, I thought
it was from before, some

00:22:25.480 --> 00:22:26.620 align:middle line:90%
saved video or something.

00:22:26.620 --> 00:22:28.690 align:middle line:90%
I was like, are you--

00:22:28.690 --> 00:22:30.482 align:middle line:84%
I saw you in your yoga
class jumping around

00:22:30.482 --> 00:22:31.607 align:middle line:90%
and stuff, what's going on?

00:22:31.607 --> 00:22:33.070 align:middle line:84%
She's like, oh
yeah, no, it's fine.

00:22:33.070 --> 00:22:34.165 align:middle line:90%
I'm fine.

00:22:34.165 --> 00:22:35.790 align:middle line:84%
I was like, what do
you-- you're-- huh?

00:22:35.790 --> 00:22:37.280 align:middle line:90%
What do you mean, you're fine?

00:22:37.280 --> 00:22:38.780 align:middle line:90%
Like, your hand's fine?

00:22:38.780 --> 00:22:40.030 align:middle line:90%
And she said, yeah, it's fine.

00:22:40.030 --> 00:22:40.830 align:middle line:90%
No problem.

00:22:40.830 --> 00:22:44.140 align:middle line:90%


00:22:44.140 --> 00:22:47.090 align:middle line:84%
So this default position
that we'd fall into of

00:22:47.090 --> 00:22:52.410 align:middle line:84%
like, well, I get that modern
medicine doesn't know anything

00:22:52.410 --> 00:22:54.660 align:middle line:84%
about chronic
degenerative conditions,

00:22:54.660 --> 00:22:56.520 align:middle line:84%
or how to deal with
chronic inflammation,

00:22:56.520 --> 00:22:58.000 align:middle line:90%
or that kind of stuff.

00:22:58.000 --> 00:23:01.770 align:middle line:84%
But if I'm in a car accident,
then I want modern medicine

00:23:01.770 --> 00:23:03.180 align:middle line:90%
to put me together.

00:23:03.180 --> 00:23:06.270 align:middle line:90%
Even that is going away.

00:23:06.270 --> 00:23:08.370 align:middle line:84%
Even that is disappearing,
because they're

00:23:08.370 --> 00:23:11.130 align:middle line:84%
going to the metal, the screws,
the plates, the rods, all

00:23:11.130 --> 00:23:12.060 align:middle line:90%
this other stuff.

00:23:12.060 --> 00:23:13.685 align:middle line:84%
Well, you're going
to have to come back

00:23:13.685 --> 00:23:16.482 align:middle line:84%
for this other surgery
so we can get it all out.

00:23:16.482 --> 00:23:18.690 align:middle line:84%
And then you're going to
need to pay us $10,000 here,

00:23:18.690 --> 00:23:22.856 align:middle line:84%
and then you're going to need
to pay us $10,000 over here.

00:23:22.856 --> 00:23:26.980 align:middle line:90%
Is that making sense to anybody?

00:23:26.980 --> 00:23:29.470 align:middle line:90%
Even that's going away.

00:23:29.470 --> 00:23:31.300 align:middle line:84%
So more and more
and more, I find

00:23:31.300 --> 00:23:33.280 align:middle line:84%
myself being involved
in that kind of work,

00:23:33.280 --> 00:23:34.630 align:middle line:84%
when people break
bones, and they're like,

00:23:34.630 --> 00:23:35.922 align:middle line:90%
I've got to go to the hospital.

00:23:35.922 --> 00:23:38.290 align:middle line:84%
I'm like, no no, no,
no, no, no, no, no, no.

00:23:38.290 --> 00:23:39.670 align:middle line:90%
Come over here first.

00:23:39.670 --> 00:23:40.840 align:middle line:90%
Let me have a look at you.

00:23:40.840 --> 00:23:43.090 align:middle line:84%
More and more and more I
find myself in that position.

00:23:43.090 --> 00:23:47.660 align:middle line:84%
Obviously, when I'm
out of this country,

00:23:47.660 --> 00:23:50.885 align:middle line:84%
because everything's illegal in
this country where we're free.

00:23:50.885 --> 00:23:55.010 align:middle line:90%


00:23:55.010 --> 00:23:58.190 align:middle line:90%
That's horsetail.

00:23:58.190 --> 00:23:58.990 align:middle line:90%
Which one is this?

00:23:58.990 --> 00:23:59.920 align:middle line:90%
This is-- hold on.

00:23:59.920 --> 00:24:01.940 align:middle line:84%
Let me see which
one that one is.

00:24:01.940 --> 00:24:03.815 align:middle line:84%
it's been a while since
I've looked at these.

00:24:03.815 --> 00:24:04.910 align:middle line:90%
Oh, that's chanca piedra.

00:24:04.910 --> 00:24:07.100 align:middle line:84%
Ooh, chanca piedra needs
a little bit of a voice.

00:24:07.100 --> 00:24:09.850 align:middle line:90%


00:24:09.850 --> 00:24:11.380 align:middle line:90%
It's called chanca piedra.

00:24:11.380 --> 00:24:12.760 align:middle line:90%
What does chanca piedra mean?

00:24:12.760 --> 00:24:15.040 align:middle line:84%
Does anybody know what
that-- chanca piedra,

00:24:15.040 --> 00:24:16.190 align:middle line:90%
what does that mean?

00:24:16.190 --> 00:24:17.140 align:middle line:90%
Chanca.

00:24:17.140 --> 00:24:18.160 align:middle line:90%
OK, stone.

00:24:18.160 --> 00:24:20.080 align:middle line:90%
Piedra is stone.

00:24:20.080 --> 00:24:21.770 align:middle line:90%
Stone breaker.

00:24:21.770 --> 00:24:22.570 align:middle line:90%
Stone breaker.

00:24:22.570 --> 00:24:24.362 align:middle line:84%
This is my heavy metal
band, chanca piedra.

00:24:24.362 --> 00:24:27.650 align:middle line:84%
That's what we call
ourselves, the Stone Breakers.

00:24:27.650 --> 00:24:29.920 align:middle line:10%
Chanca piedra is a
very interesting herb,

00:24:29.920 --> 00:24:33.610 align:middle line:10%
and has a very important role
for us, because more and more

00:24:33.610 --> 00:24:36.760 align:middle line:10%
and more, with the
antibiotic age and even

00:24:36.760 --> 00:24:39.190 align:middle line:10%
with the age of herbalism,
more and more and more

00:24:39.190 --> 00:24:45.360 align:middle line:10%
of these critters, parasites.

00:24:45.360 --> 00:24:49.340 align:middle line:90%


00:24:49.340 --> 00:24:52.070 align:middle line:10%
They want to defend themselves
by shielding themselves

00:24:52.070 --> 00:24:54.040 align:middle line:10%
with a little--

00:24:54.040 --> 00:24:59.990 align:middle line:10%
it's called a
biofilm, or a shell.

00:24:59.990 --> 00:25:02.840 align:middle line:84%
This doesn't take a genius to
figure this one out, right?

00:25:02.840 --> 00:25:05.180 align:middle line:84%
When you look into nature,
let's say you disturb nature

00:25:05.180 --> 00:25:06.450 align:middle line:90%
by putting in a pier.

00:25:06.450 --> 00:25:08.570 align:middle line:84%
You know, we're going to
go out and put in a pier.

00:25:08.570 --> 00:25:10.435 align:middle line:84%
And you put those pylons
in, and then you're

00:25:10.435 --> 00:25:11.810 align:middle line:84%
going to put your
pier out there.

00:25:11.810 --> 00:25:12.680 align:middle line:84%
And all of a sudden,
you're walking out there.

00:25:12.680 --> 00:25:13.860 align:middle line:90%
You see the waves and stuff.

00:25:13.860 --> 00:25:16.027 align:middle line:84%
And after a few years, what
happens to those pylons?

00:25:16.027 --> 00:25:18.780 align:middle line:90%


00:25:18.780 --> 00:25:26.920 align:middle line:84%
They start accumulating
mollusks, oysters, shells.

00:25:26.920 --> 00:25:28.392 align:middle line:90%
You put your boat in the water.

00:25:28.392 --> 00:25:29.850 align:middle line:84%
After a few years,
what accumulates

00:25:29.850 --> 00:25:31.110 align:middle line:90%
on the outside of your boat?

00:25:31.110 --> 00:25:32.910 align:middle line:90%
Shells.

00:25:32.910 --> 00:25:34.740 align:middle line:84%
Things that are
disturbing the water,

00:25:34.740 --> 00:25:37.720 align:middle line:84%
eventually a little shell
organism will form on it.

00:25:37.720 --> 00:25:39.360 align:middle line:90%
Another one will form on it.

00:25:39.360 --> 00:25:42.570 align:middle line:84%
And that shell is
called a biofilm,

00:25:42.570 --> 00:25:44.370 align:middle line:90%
sometimes called a biofilm.

00:25:44.370 --> 00:25:46.830 align:middle line:84%
And in order to get the
little critter, the mollusks,

00:25:46.830 --> 00:25:51.660 align:middle line:84%
the oyster, the snail, the
slug that's underneath,

00:25:51.660 --> 00:25:53.460 align:middle line:84%
you need to get
through the shell.

00:25:53.460 --> 00:25:55.380 align:middle line:84%
And that's what
chanca piedra does.

00:25:55.380 --> 00:26:02.600 align:middle line:84%
And that's why chanca piedra
is in my personal parasite

00:26:02.600 --> 00:26:03.400 align:middle line:90%
formula.

00:26:03.400 --> 00:26:08.680 align:middle line:90%


00:26:08.680 --> 00:26:11.290 align:middle line:84%
We can't talk
about that, can we?

00:26:11.290 --> 00:26:14.920 align:middle line:84%
Nobody has parasites
unless they're south

00:26:14.920 --> 00:26:17.740 align:middle line:90%
of the border or something.

00:26:17.740 --> 00:26:21.400 align:middle line:84%
I mean, that's the
story we get in America.

00:26:21.400 --> 00:26:22.980 align:middle line:90%
Oh, there's no parasites here.

00:26:22.980 --> 00:26:25.820 align:middle line:90%
It's over there.

00:26:25.820 --> 00:26:28.670 align:middle line:90%
You get parasites in Mexico.

00:26:28.670 --> 00:26:31.160 align:middle line:90%
There's no parasites over here.

00:26:31.160 --> 00:26:33.500 align:middle line:84%
I've got a gal right
now, she's about 250 days

00:26:33.500 --> 00:26:36.820 align:middle line:84%
into a parasite cleanse,
still getting worms out.

00:26:36.820 --> 00:26:38.128 align:middle line:90%
Still.

00:26:38.128 --> 00:26:40.670 align:middle line:84%
Now, she grew up with dogs and
animals, and was licking them.

00:26:40.670 --> 00:26:43.967 align:middle line:84%
And of course she listened to
her health care providers, who

00:26:43.967 --> 00:26:45.800 align:middle line:84%
told her there's no
such thing as parasites,

00:26:45.800 --> 00:26:47.300 align:middle line:90%
there's nothing to worry about.

00:26:47.300 --> 00:26:48.653 align:middle line:90%
And eventually, she started--

00:26:48.653 --> 00:26:49.820 align:middle line:90%
and then it was interesting.

00:26:49.820 --> 00:26:51.620 align:middle line:84%
When we finally got
her nailed down,

00:26:51.620 --> 00:26:55.490 align:middle line:84%
like OK, now you're going to do
the parasite cleanse, she went,

00:26:55.490 --> 00:26:59.420 align:middle line:84%
no, nope, I'm not
going to do it.

00:26:59.420 --> 00:27:03.080 align:middle line:84%
And she evaded it
for a couple months.

00:27:03.080 --> 00:27:05.384 align:middle line:90%
Why do you think that is?

00:27:05.384 --> 00:27:07.880 align:middle line:90%
>> [INAUDIBLE]

00:27:07.880 --> 00:27:09.490 align:middle line:90%
>> That's right.

00:27:09.490 --> 00:27:15.060 align:middle line:84%
Oh, that was-- parasites
don't want to be found.

00:27:15.060 --> 00:27:18.180 align:middle line:90%


00:27:18.180 --> 00:27:20.867 align:middle line:90%
That's a big story right there.

00:27:20.867 --> 00:27:22.450 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to say
that again, and we're

00:27:22.450 --> 00:27:24.590 align:middle line:84%
going to think about
that, what that means.

00:27:24.590 --> 00:27:29.180 align:middle line:84%
Parasites don't
want to be found.

00:27:29.180 --> 00:27:31.700 align:middle line:84%
So the thing they want
more than anything

00:27:31.700 --> 00:27:36.020 align:middle line:84%
is to make sure you don't
even think they exist.

00:27:36.020 --> 00:27:37.820 align:middle line:84%
Now, I bring that back
to Rudolf Steiner,

00:27:37.820 --> 00:27:39.820 align:middle line:84%
because we're going to
get in to Rudolf Steiner.

00:27:39.820 --> 00:27:43.070 align:middle line:84%
And Rudolf Steiner correlates
evil to parasitism.

00:27:43.070 --> 00:27:45.860 align:middle line:84%
That's what evil
is on both sides.

00:27:45.860 --> 00:27:48.110 align:middle line:84%
So there's one form,
there's the hardened form

00:27:48.110 --> 00:27:50.120 align:middle line:84%
of evil, which is
the sedimentary form,

00:27:50.120 --> 00:27:53.630 align:middle line:84%
or he called it the
Ahrimanic form, of parasites,

00:27:53.630 --> 00:27:56.450 align:middle line:90%
which chanca piedra breaks up.

00:27:56.450 --> 00:27:59.150 align:middle line:84%
The ones that shell themselves
off, and shield themselves off,

00:27:59.150 --> 00:28:01.550 align:middle line:84%
and block themselves off, or
put themselves in a dungeon,

00:28:01.550 --> 00:28:03.740 align:middle line:84%
or have underground
passageways where

00:28:03.740 --> 00:28:07.300 align:middle line:84%
they're trafficking
the kids or whatever,

00:28:07.300 --> 00:28:08.870 align:middle line:90%
if you know what I mean.

00:28:08.870 --> 00:28:11.210 align:middle line:84%
Is everyone following
where this goes?

00:28:11.210 --> 00:28:14.510 align:middle line:84%
Because there's a
very strong argument

00:28:14.510 --> 00:28:16.460 align:middle line:84%
here that it's
parasites that are

00:28:16.460 --> 00:28:20.390 align:middle line:90%
running the world, very strong.

00:28:20.390 --> 00:28:22.805 align:middle line:84%
It's almost an
unbeatable argument.

00:28:22.805 --> 00:28:24.680 align:middle line:84%
I've been playing with
that particular theory

00:28:24.680 --> 00:28:25.560 align:middle line:90%
for quite some time.

00:28:25.560 --> 00:28:27.185 align:middle line:10%
It's almost unbeatable,
and it's almost

00:28:27.185 --> 00:28:31.295 align:middle line:10%
an indefensible argument,
that it's parasites

00:28:31.295 --> 00:28:32.420 align:middle line:10%
that are running the world.

00:28:32.420 --> 00:28:39.180 align:middle line:84%
So when we look at our
leaders, we go parasites.

00:28:39.180 --> 00:28:41.590 align:middle line:84%
Because they're not
actually creating anything.

00:28:41.590 --> 00:28:44.590 align:middle line:90%
They're taking.

00:28:44.590 --> 00:28:46.415 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:28:46.415 --> 00:28:47.290 align:middle line:90%
You have what I need.

00:28:47.290 --> 00:28:49.090 align:middle line:90%
I'm going to take it.

00:28:49.090 --> 00:28:50.860 align:middle line:90%
Let's just steal your business.

00:28:50.860 --> 00:28:53.080 align:middle line:90%
We'll just take this.

00:28:53.080 --> 00:28:54.720 align:middle line:84%
And we're going to
take this one too,

00:28:54.720 --> 00:28:56.840 align:middle line:90%
and we'll take this one also.

00:28:56.840 --> 00:28:58.810 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't take a genius
to figure this out.

00:28:58.810 --> 00:29:00.070 align:middle line:90%
And it's all done--

00:29:00.070 --> 00:29:06.530 align:middle line:84%
oh, it's all legal, because
parasites don't exist.

00:29:06.530 --> 00:29:09.622 align:middle line:90%
So it's perfectly fine.

00:29:09.622 --> 00:29:11.080 align:middle line:84%
The one thing that
a parasite wants

00:29:11.080 --> 00:29:12.880 align:middle line:84%
you more than anything
to be convinced of

00:29:12.880 --> 00:29:14.200 align:middle line:90%
is that they don't exist.

00:29:14.200 --> 00:29:15.250 align:middle line:90%
That's number one.

00:29:15.250 --> 00:29:16.807 align:middle line:90%
It's number one on their list.

00:29:16.807 --> 00:29:18.640 align:middle line:84%
That's why we live in
a world where they go,

00:29:18.640 --> 00:29:19.440 align:middle line:90%
oh, good and evil?

00:29:19.440 --> 00:29:20.830 align:middle line:90%
That's just relative.

00:29:20.830 --> 00:29:22.930 align:middle line:84%
That doesn't--
there's no real evil.

00:29:22.930 --> 00:29:24.520 align:middle line:90%
It's just relative.

00:29:24.520 --> 00:29:28.837 align:middle line:84%
That's exactly why we live
in that kind of a world.

00:29:28.837 --> 00:29:30.670 align:middle line:84%
But as soon as you
realize this, and as soon

00:29:30.670 --> 00:29:38.800 align:middle line:84%
as you start getting
the parasites out,

00:29:38.800 --> 00:29:39.700 align:middle line:90%
you start going--

00:29:39.700 --> 00:29:43.930 align:middle line:84%
because as soon as they come
out, you wake up real quick.

00:29:43.930 --> 00:29:46.540 align:middle line:84%
Because it's all of a sudden,
oh, that's somebody else.

00:29:46.540 --> 00:29:47.540 align:middle line:90%
I don't have it in me.

00:29:47.540 --> 00:29:48.340 align:middle line:90%
I don't have that.

00:29:48.340 --> 00:29:50.290 align:middle line:90%
It's over there.

00:29:50.290 --> 00:29:53.160 align:middle line:90%
I would never-- over there.

00:29:53.160 --> 00:29:56.650 align:middle line:84%
But then when a worm comes
out of you, you go, uh-oh.

00:29:56.650 --> 00:29:58.240 align:middle line:84%
Candida can affect
your thoughts.

00:29:58.240 --> 00:30:00.430 align:middle line:90%
Candida can affect your desires.

00:30:00.430 --> 00:30:02.980 align:middle line:90%
Candida affects your food.

00:30:02.980 --> 00:30:05.830 align:middle line:84%
Candida is affecting
your desire for sugar.

00:30:05.830 --> 00:30:09.780 align:middle line:84%
Candida is a simple
yeast organism parasite.

00:30:09.780 --> 00:30:14.290 align:middle line:84%
Candida is nothing compared
to a tapeworm or liver fluke.

00:30:14.290 --> 00:30:17.290 align:middle line:84%
So if Candida can affect our
mind, look at Robert Sapolsky.

00:30:17.290 --> 00:30:19.930 align:middle line:84%
You know Robert Sapolsky's
work over at Stanford?

00:30:19.930 --> 00:30:22.240 align:middle line:90%
He got into toxoplasmosis.

00:30:22.240 --> 00:30:28.210 align:middle line:84%
Toxo is a cat parasite
that allows the mouse--

00:30:28.210 --> 00:30:29.950 align:middle line:84%
the mouse wants to
get into the cat

00:30:29.950 --> 00:30:33.160 align:middle line:84%
because the toxo is in the mouse
and wants to get into the cat.

00:30:33.160 --> 00:30:35.830 align:middle line:84%
So what it does is it
affects the mouse's mind

00:30:35.830 --> 00:30:39.970 align:middle line:84%
to get the mouse involved in
highly dangerous behavior,

00:30:39.970 --> 00:30:42.565 align:middle line:84%
like running around
where there's cat urine.

00:30:42.565 --> 00:30:45.870 align:middle line:90%


00:30:45.870 --> 00:30:48.510 align:middle line:84%
Robert Sapolsky, after a
decade of studying toxo,

00:30:48.510 --> 00:30:50.100 align:middle line:84%
started realizing
there's very little

00:30:50.100 --> 00:30:54.150 align:middle line:84%
free will going on
anywhere, meaning

00:30:54.150 --> 00:30:59.820 align:middle line:84%
that people's behavior is being
influenced by not themselves.

00:30:59.820 --> 00:31:02.508 align:middle line:84%
I don't know how else
to put that more mildly.

00:31:02.508 --> 00:31:04.050 align:middle line:84%
People's behavior
is being influenced

00:31:04.050 --> 00:31:05.250 align:middle line:90%
by things that are not you.

00:31:05.250 --> 00:31:07.850 align:middle line:90%


00:31:07.850 --> 00:31:09.730 align:middle line:90%
This is a very strong argument.

00:31:09.730 --> 00:31:11.750 align:middle line:84%
It's almost an
unbeatable argument.

00:31:11.750 --> 00:31:12.550 align:middle line:90%
It really is.

00:31:12.550 --> 00:31:14.383 align:middle line:84%
The more you dig into
this, the more you go,

00:31:14.383 --> 00:31:18.340 align:middle line:84%
jeez, because every year,
twice a year, one's coming up,

00:31:18.340 --> 00:31:20.342 align:middle line:84%
March 13th, we're going
to be on the heavy--

00:31:20.342 --> 00:31:22.300 align:middle line:84%
it's going to actually
begin for me on March 1.

00:31:22.300 --> 00:31:25.030 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to be starting on
the heavy doses of my Remove

00:31:25.030 --> 00:31:27.340 align:middle line:90%
Unwanted Guests product.

00:31:27.340 --> 00:31:30.550 align:middle line:90%
Remove Unwanted Guests, RUG.

00:31:30.550 --> 00:31:32.320 align:middle line:90%
Like a bug in a rug.

00:31:32.320 --> 00:31:35.950 align:middle line:84%
And that will go on for
probably two and a half months.

00:31:35.950 --> 00:31:38.920 align:middle line:84%
And then I'll do another one
when it turns from summer

00:31:38.920 --> 00:31:40.690 align:middle line:90%
into fall or autumn.

00:31:40.690 --> 00:31:42.870 align:middle line:84%
And I'll do another deep,
deep clean at that time.

00:31:42.870 --> 00:31:45.370 align:middle line:84%
And those are the times to do
it, because spring cleaning is

00:31:45.370 --> 00:31:46.170 align:middle line:90%
coming up.

00:31:46.170 --> 00:31:54.280 align:middle line:10%
And so you're going to
go after the P word.

00:31:54.280 --> 00:31:55.080 align:middle line:90%
What is that?

00:31:55.080 --> 00:31:57.780 align:middle line:90%
That product has chanca piedra.

00:31:57.780 --> 00:32:01.050 align:middle line:84%
It has wormwood, clove,
black walnut hull,

00:32:01.050 --> 00:32:04.260 align:middle line:84%
high doses of enzymes,
and then silymarin, which

00:32:04.260 --> 00:32:06.330 align:middle line:90%
is just basically to deal--

00:32:06.330 --> 00:32:11.170 align:middle line:84%
when you start unloading the
crust of those organisms,

00:32:11.170 --> 00:32:12.720 align:middle line:90%
it's a toxic load.

00:32:12.720 --> 00:32:15.323 align:middle line:84%
So your body has to quickly
regenerate the liver,

00:32:15.323 --> 00:32:17.490 align:middle line:84%
and process it, and regenerate
liver and process it.

00:32:17.490 --> 00:32:21.120 align:middle line:84%
And silymarin is the
main liver rejuvenator.

00:32:21.120 --> 00:32:22.920 align:middle line:10%
That combination
was gifted to me

00:32:22.920 --> 00:32:25.440 align:middle line:10%
by a friend who's no longer
on the Earth, who battled

00:32:25.440 --> 00:32:28.650 align:middle line:10%
kidney cancer for 28 years.

00:32:28.650 --> 00:32:32.250 align:middle line:10%
He finally didn't make it, but
jeez, he got 28 more years.

00:32:32.250 --> 00:32:35.520 align:middle line:84%
And he did it all alternative,
none of the mainstream way.

00:32:35.520 --> 00:32:37.530 align:middle line:84%
So that's another thing
too, is like we're all

00:32:37.530 --> 00:32:40.020 align:middle line:84%
going to check out of
here at some point.

00:32:40.020 --> 00:32:41.430 align:middle line:90%
Go out with dignity.

00:32:41.430 --> 00:32:44.460 align:middle line:84%
Go out with dignity instead of
going, oh, I'll just go to--

00:32:44.460 --> 00:32:49.945 align:middle line:84%
you know what's going to
happen if you go to "them".

00:32:49.945 --> 00:32:50.927 align:middle line:90%
Who's "them"?

00:32:50.927 --> 00:32:55.840 align:middle line:90%


00:32:55.840 --> 00:32:59.080 align:middle line:90%
The cut, burn, poison theory.

00:32:59.080 --> 00:33:01.260 align:middle line:90%
The pill for every ill theory.

00:33:01.260 --> 00:33:03.270 align:middle line:90%
The scientism theory.

00:33:03.270 --> 00:33:09.670 align:middle line:84%
There's only a material
cause of your condition.

00:33:09.670 --> 00:33:12.700 align:middle line:84%
There's no spiritual
cause of your condition.

00:33:12.700 --> 00:33:15.010 align:middle line:84%
There's no mental cause
of your condition.

00:33:15.010 --> 00:33:17.530 align:middle line:84%
There's no emotional
cause of your condition.

00:33:17.530 --> 00:33:19.720 align:middle line:90%
You think that we're past that?

00:33:19.720 --> 00:33:21.470 align:middle line:84%
I know in this room
you're past it, right?

00:33:21.470 --> 00:33:22.360 align:middle line:84%
Probably the people
watching at home.

00:33:22.360 --> 00:33:23.160 align:middle line:90%
We're all past it.

00:33:23.160 --> 00:33:24.190 align:middle line:90%
We're past that stage.

00:33:24.190 --> 00:33:26.020 align:middle line:90%
Nuh-uh, not this system.

00:33:26.020 --> 00:33:29.050 align:middle line:84%
This system's default
is that, right?

00:33:29.050 --> 00:33:31.450 align:middle line:84%
There's no hospital
that's on to that.

00:33:31.450 --> 00:33:33.660 align:middle line:84%
They default into, oh,
let's give them more drugs.

00:33:33.660 --> 00:33:34.960 align:middle line:90%
Oh, let's give them more pills.

00:33:34.960 --> 00:33:36.918 align:middle line:84%
Oh, we're going to-- when
my dad was going down

00:33:36.918 --> 00:33:39.370 align:middle line:84%
for the last time, he got
a hospital-based infection.

00:33:39.370 --> 00:33:42.790 align:middle line:84%
My dad's an askhole, the
type of guy who asks you,

00:33:42.790 --> 00:33:44.040 align:middle line:90%
hey, what's your opinion?

00:33:44.040 --> 00:33:44.990 align:middle line:90%
What do you think I should do?

00:33:44.990 --> 00:33:46.150 align:middle line:84%
And you're like
hey, do this dad.

00:33:46.150 --> 00:33:46.570 align:middle line:90%
Do this.

00:33:46.570 --> 00:33:47.650 align:middle line:90%
Why don't you do that?

00:33:47.650 --> 00:33:48.850 align:middle line:90%
Then guess what happens?

00:33:48.850 --> 00:33:50.840 align:middle line:90%
He does the exact opposite.

00:33:50.840 --> 00:33:53.920 align:middle line:90%
Do you know people like that?

00:33:53.920 --> 00:33:55.888 align:middle line:84%
And so my dad was like,
oh my gallbladder.

00:33:55.888 --> 00:33:58.180 align:middle line:84%
Every time I eat this roast
beef sandwich and Gatorade,

00:33:58.180 --> 00:33:59.680 align:middle line:90%
my gallbladder hurts.

00:33:59.680 --> 00:34:01.460 align:middle line:84%
Let's get rid of
the gallbladder.

00:34:01.460 --> 00:34:02.260 align:middle line:90%
No, dad.

00:34:02.260 --> 00:34:03.190 align:middle line:90%
That's not a good idea.

00:34:03.190 --> 00:34:04.840 align:middle line:84%
You should do this
instead or that instead.

00:34:04.840 --> 00:34:05.610 align:middle line:90%
Or how about doing this.

00:34:05.610 --> 00:34:06.818 align:middle line:90%
And he didn't do any of that.

00:34:06.818 --> 00:34:08.830 align:middle line:84%
He doesn't-- he
has never listened.

00:34:08.830 --> 00:34:10.900 align:middle line:84%
This is why my mom, 30
years ago, she's like,

00:34:10.900 --> 00:34:11.980 align:middle line:90%
this guy's out to lunch.

00:34:11.980 --> 00:34:15.797 align:middle line:90%


00:34:15.797 --> 00:34:18.130 align:middle line:84%
So he ends up in a hospital
getting his gallbladder out,

00:34:18.130 --> 00:34:21.159 align:middle line:84%
gets hospital-based
infections, three of them.

00:34:21.159 --> 00:34:22.758 align:middle line:90%
MRSA included.

00:34:22.758 --> 00:34:24.550 align:middle line:84%
Going down for the last
time, I go in there

00:34:24.550 --> 00:34:26.590 align:middle line:84%
and I'm trying to get
him off of the IVs that

00:34:26.590 --> 00:34:30.679 align:middle line:84%
are going into him, like muscle
relaxants, all these crazy IVs

00:34:30.679 --> 00:34:31.929 align:middle line:90%
that they're putting into him.

00:34:31.929 --> 00:34:34.210 align:middle line:90%
We can't stop it.

00:34:34.210 --> 00:34:36.650 align:middle line:84%
I'm like, stop putting
this stuff into him.

00:34:36.650 --> 00:34:38.058 align:middle line:84%
He doesn't need
muscle relaxants.

00:34:38.058 --> 00:34:39.100 align:middle line:90%
He doesn't need this one.

00:34:39.100 --> 00:34:40.179 align:middle line:90%
He doesn't need that one.

00:34:40.179 --> 00:34:41.710 align:middle line:84%
Guess what the
hospital's trying to do

00:34:41.710 --> 00:34:44.199 align:middle line:84%
as I dug around on that floor
like why are they putting this

00:34:44.199 --> 00:34:44.560 align:middle line:90%
into him?

00:34:44.560 --> 00:34:46.727 align:middle line:84%
Why are they putting this
into other people up here?

00:34:46.727 --> 00:34:48.950 align:middle line:84%
They're trying to get
through inventory.

00:34:48.950 --> 00:34:58.733 align:middle line:90%


00:34:58.733 --> 00:35:00.150 align:middle line:84%
So as much as you
think, oh, we're

00:35:00.150 --> 00:35:02.692 align:middle line:84%
advanced, because I get people
that are like, no, no, no, no.

00:35:02.692 --> 00:35:04.000 align:middle line:90%
Hospitals are changing.

00:35:04.000 --> 00:35:04.840 align:middle line:90%
No, no, no, no, no.

00:35:04.840 --> 00:35:07.340 align:middle line:84%
People are like, they consider
the spiritual side of illness

00:35:07.340 --> 00:35:09.340 align:middle line:84%
now, and they consider
the emotional side.

00:35:09.340 --> 00:35:11.350 align:middle line:84%
I was like, well, I don't
know what hospital you're in.

00:35:11.350 --> 00:35:12.267 align:middle line:90%
What are you talking--

00:35:12.267 --> 00:35:14.470 align:middle line:90%
you're in some kind of fantasy.

00:35:14.470 --> 00:35:16.090 align:middle line:90%
I don't know where you are.

00:35:16.090 --> 00:35:18.010 align:middle line:90%
That's a fantasy there, buddy.

00:35:18.010 --> 00:35:19.600 align:middle line:90%
That's not real.

00:35:19.600 --> 00:35:21.790 align:middle line:90%
Like in your mind, yes.

00:35:21.790 --> 00:35:24.400 align:middle line:90%
In our little bubble here, yes.

00:35:24.400 --> 00:35:25.553 align:middle line:90%
But in reality?

00:35:25.553 --> 00:35:27.220 align:middle line:84%
Like what's going on
right now down here

00:35:27.220 --> 00:35:29.200 align:middle line:90%
at Center of Hope Hospital?

00:35:29.200 --> 00:35:31.660 align:middle line:90%
No, no, no, no, no.

00:35:31.660 --> 00:35:34.580 align:middle line:84%
They're trying to unload
inventory on their patients

00:35:34.580 --> 00:35:35.380 align:middle line:90%
like my dad.

00:35:35.380 --> 00:35:36.310 align:middle line:90%
So I went in there.

00:35:36.310 --> 00:35:37.685 align:middle line:84%
He's like-- I'm
looking at him, I

00:35:37.685 --> 00:35:39.490 align:middle line:84%
go he's got probably
two days to live.

00:35:39.490 --> 00:35:42.910 align:middle line:84%
Lucky for his particular
case, I had just bottled up

00:35:42.910 --> 00:35:46.610 align:middle line:84%
76 bottles of Ormus Gold,
and I had that in my car

00:35:46.610 --> 00:35:48.400 align:middle line:84%
by a crazy series
of events for him.

00:35:48.400 --> 00:35:53.210 align:middle line:84%
Now, if he was conscious, if
he was awake and conscious,

00:35:53.210 --> 00:35:54.010 align:middle line:90%
there's no--

00:35:54.010 --> 00:35:55.690 align:middle line:90%
he'd be dead for sure.

00:35:55.690 --> 00:35:58.900 align:middle line:84%
But his karma had
rendered him unconscious

00:35:58.900 --> 00:36:02.440 align:middle line:84%
so he could not resist
what I had for him.

00:36:02.440 --> 00:36:03.880 align:middle line:90%
Does this make sense to you?

00:36:03.880 --> 00:36:05.350 align:middle line:84%
I thought that was
so interesting.

00:36:05.350 --> 00:36:06.975 align:middle line:84%
As I really got into
it over the years,

00:36:06.975 --> 00:36:08.770 align:middle line:84%
I started looking at
it going, jeez, whoa.

00:36:08.770 --> 00:36:13.330 align:middle line:84%
He had to be knocked unconscious
in order to be saved.

00:36:13.330 --> 00:36:17.650 align:middle line:84%
Because if he was conscious, he
would definitely not be saved,

00:36:17.650 --> 00:36:21.498 align:middle line:84%
and that his son would have the
cure for him right in his car,

00:36:21.498 --> 00:36:24.040 align:middle line:84%
and would show up here all the
way from Montreal, all the way

00:36:24.040 --> 00:36:26.080 align:middle line:84%
to Southern California,
show up there

00:36:26.080 --> 00:36:27.640 align:middle line:90%
and have it all ready to go.

00:36:27.640 --> 00:36:29.830 align:middle line:84%
Not a chance in the
world he would ever

00:36:29.830 --> 00:36:31.720 align:middle line:90%
touch the stuff that I have.

00:36:31.720 --> 00:36:34.382 align:middle line:84%
Even though I would
go like this, take--

00:36:34.382 --> 00:36:36.340 align:middle line:84%
even that-- I mean, I'm
going to tell you this.

00:36:36.340 --> 00:36:38.350 align:middle line:90%
Let me tell you this.

00:36:38.350 --> 00:36:41.840 align:middle line:84%
I give his girlfriend 10
bottles of Ormus Gold.

00:36:41.840 --> 00:36:43.423 align:middle line:90%
I said just rub it all over him.

00:36:43.423 --> 00:36:44.590 align:middle line:90%
You don't have to ingest it.

00:36:44.590 --> 00:36:45.420 align:middle line:84%
It just goes right
through your skin.

00:36:45.420 --> 00:36:46.390 align:middle line:90%
It falls into you.

00:36:46.390 --> 00:36:47.830 align:middle line:90%
My Ormus Gold.

00:36:47.830 --> 00:36:49.615 align:middle line:84%
My Ormus Gold is one
third or one fourth

00:36:49.615 --> 00:36:50.740 align:middle line:90%
of the Philosopher's Stone.

00:36:50.740 --> 00:36:52.660 align:middle line:84%
I haven't figured out one
alchemical riddle in my life,

00:36:52.660 --> 00:36:54.493 align:middle line:84%
and I know it's an
alchemical riddle because

00:36:54.493 --> 00:36:56.260 align:middle line:90%
of the way it's made.

00:36:56.260 --> 00:36:57.880 align:middle line:84%
It's not made like
a normal chemistry.

00:36:57.880 --> 00:37:00.370 align:middle line:84%
It's made alchemically,
using very interesting

00:37:00.370 --> 00:37:03.580 align:middle line:84%
natural substances that
anybody could figure out

00:37:03.580 --> 00:37:06.833 align:middle line:90%
at the primitive Egyptian level.

00:37:06.833 --> 00:37:08.500 align:middle line:84%
You know when we were
building pyramids,

00:37:08.500 --> 00:37:10.930 align:middle line:84%
remember we were cavemen,
then pyramids all of a sudden?

00:37:10.930 --> 00:37:12.040 align:middle line:90%
Remember that story?

00:37:12.040 --> 00:37:14.250 align:middle line:90%
Did that not make sense to you?

00:37:14.250 --> 00:37:16.740 align:middle line:84%
That never quite
made sense to me.

00:37:16.740 --> 00:37:18.363 align:middle line:84%
Anyway, so at that
level of what's

00:37:18.363 --> 00:37:19.780 align:middle line:84%
available to the
ancient Egyptian,

00:37:19.780 --> 00:37:23.840 align:middle line:84%
or the ancient Chinese,
or the ancient Vedics,

00:37:23.840 --> 00:37:24.715 align:middle line:90%
that's how it's made.

00:37:24.715 --> 00:37:26.750 align:middle line:84%
It's very simple,
but it's tricky.

00:37:26.750 --> 00:37:27.700 align:middle line:90%
It's a riddle.

00:37:27.700 --> 00:37:29.470 align:middle line:84%
And that's why I
know it's authentic.

00:37:29.470 --> 00:37:31.810 align:middle line:84%
And what it does is as soon
as it touches any tissue it

00:37:31.810 --> 00:37:33.018 align:middle line:90%
touches, it makes it younger.

00:37:33.018 --> 00:37:33.880 align:middle line:90%
That's how it works.

00:37:33.880 --> 00:37:36.297 align:middle line:84%
That's what we've noticed over
the years in September 2006

00:37:36.297 --> 00:37:38.500 align:middle line:84%
when we cracked
the secret of that.

00:37:38.500 --> 00:37:40.603 align:middle line:84%
I'm not vouching for any
other Ormus Gold, product

00:37:40.603 --> 00:37:42.520 align:middle line:84%
because other Ormus Gold
products are made out

00:37:42.520 --> 00:37:44.590 align:middle line:84%
of Dead Sea salt extracts,
and they have nothing

00:37:44.590 --> 00:37:45.910 align:middle line:90%
to do with what my product is.

00:37:45.910 --> 00:37:48.430 align:middle line:84%
My product is made out of
pure gold, which we will

00:37:48.430 --> 00:37:51.273 align:middle line:90%
purify sometimes 100 times.

00:37:51.273 --> 00:37:52.690 align:middle line:84%
So we'll strip out
the impurities,

00:37:52.690 --> 00:37:54.898 align:middle line:84%
then strip out more again,
then strip out more again,

00:37:54.898 --> 00:37:58.270 align:middle line:84%
then strip out more again,
100 times sometimes till we

00:37:58.270 --> 00:37:59.510 align:middle line:90%
get to the pure gold metal.

00:37:59.510 --> 00:38:02.820 align:middle line:84%
Then we push it back
into the Ormus form,

00:38:02.820 --> 00:38:05.555 align:middle line:84%
which for those of you who know
what that is, you'll go oh, OK.

00:38:05.555 --> 00:38:07.180 align:middle line:84%
I'm giving you a
little hint for people

00:38:07.180 --> 00:38:09.930 align:middle line:84%
who know what that means
or can pursue that.

00:38:09.930 --> 00:38:12.610 align:middle line:84%
We push it back
into the Ormus form,

00:38:12.610 --> 00:38:17.470 align:middle line:84%
and then we suspend it
in a liquid with silica

00:38:17.470 --> 00:38:19.090 align:middle line:84%
as the carrier,
because if it doesn't

00:38:19.090 --> 00:38:21.340 align:middle line:84%
have silica as the carrier,
it will eat into the glass

00:38:21.340 --> 00:38:22.303 align:middle line:90%
and try to escape.

00:38:22.303 --> 00:38:24.220 align:middle line:84%
And as soon as you put
that on someone's skin,

00:38:24.220 --> 00:38:27.460 align:middle line:84%
the silica is left behind, and
the gold falls into the person.

00:38:27.460 --> 00:38:30.610 align:middle line:84%
And it will rejuvenate their
tissue on the spot right there.

00:38:30.610 --> 00:38:33.050 align:middle line:10%
So with my dad, 10
bottles, I was like--

00:38:33.050 --> 00:38:35.050 align:middle line:10%
I had known from many
years of experience

00:38:35.050 --> 00:38:38.740 align:middle line:10%
that five bottles of
that stuff will do crazy,

00:38:38.740 --> 00:38:41.080 align:middle line:10%
miraculous-- on anything.

00:38:41.080 --> 00:38:42.220 align:middle line:10%
You name it.

00:38:42.220 --> 00:38:44.160 align:middle line:10%
Black acne.

00:38:44.160 --> 00:38:45.370 align:middle line:10%
You name what the deal is.

00:38:45.370 --> 00:38:48.010 align:middle line:10%
Five bottles of that
material will definitely

00:38:48.010 --> 00:38:51.370 align:middle line:10%
beat any other thing you
can find in the world.

00:38:51.370 --> 00:38:53.440 align:middle line:84%
So I was, like here,
let's do 10 bottles.

00:38:53.440 --> 00:38:54.533 align:middle line:90%
So I give him 10 bottles.

00:38:54.533 --> 00:38:56.200 align:middle line:84%
His girlfriend puts
it on him every day,

00:38:56.200 --> 00:38:57.783 align:middle line:84%
all on his bed sores,
all on his face,

00:38:57.783 --> 00:38:59.050 align:middle line:90%
everything, all over his body.

00:38:59.050 --> 00:39:00.850 align:middle line:10%
He's out of there
within two weeks.

00:39:00.850 --> 00:39:02.000 align:middle line:10%
He completely recovered.

00:39:02.000 --> 00:39:04.417 align:middle line:84%
I have the picture of what he
looked like when I showed up

00:39:04.417 --> 00:39:05.530 align:middle line:90%
in that room.

00:39:05.530 --> 00:39:07.120 align:middle line:90%
That's a wild picture.

00:39:07.120 --> 00:39:08.920 align:middle line:10%
But anyway, he got out of there.

00:39:08.920 --> 00:39:12.760 align:middle line:84%
Years later, I'm like here dad,
this is what saved your ass.

00:39:12.760 --> 00:39:14.530 align:middle line:84%
This bottle right
here, this saved you.

00:39:14.530 --> 00:39:15.730 align:middle line:90%
I know you don't get it.

00:39:15.730 --> 00:39:17.590 align:middle line:84%
I know you're
completely out of it.

00:39:17.590 --> 00:39:20.850 align:middle line:90%
Because he's out of it.

00:39:20.850 --> 00:39:22.500 align:middle line:90%
But I'm giving it to you anyway.

00:39:22.500 --> 00:39:23.880 align:middle line:90%
I know you don't understand it.

00:39:23.880 --> 00:39:26.970 align:middle line:84%
I know you're not going to
get it no matter what I say.

00:39:26.970 --> 00:39:27.780 align:middle line:90%
But you know what?

00:39:27.780 --> 00:39:31.180 align:middle line:84%
I'm just going to
give it to you anyway.

00:39:31.180 --> 00:39:34.420 align:middle line:90%
And that's how stuck people are.

00:39:34.420 --> 00:39:37.030 align:middle line:90%
It's just amazing to me.

00:39:37.030 --> 00:39:39.580 align:middle line:84%
It's like, what has
to happen to you

00:39:39.580 --> 00:39:43.660 align:middle line:90%
before you can open your mind?

00:39:43.660 --> 00:39:45.310 align:middle line:90%
What is it going to take?

00:39:45.310 --> 00:39:47.380 align:middle line:84%
Many years in Dr.
Hitt's office down

00:39:47.380 --> 00:39:49.990 align:middle line:84%
in Tijuana, with people coming
in with terminal illness,

00:39:49.990 --> 00:39:51.940 align:middle line:84%
and they'd been through
the whole system.

00:39:51.940 --> 00:39:54.790 align:middle line:84%
So they'd been cut, they'd been
burned, they'd been poisoned.

00:39:54.790 --> 00:39:56.890 align:middle line:84%
They'd been given the
pills for their ills.

00:39:56.890 --> 00:40:00.160 align:middle line:84%
They'd been given the whole
rigmarole of scientism,

00:40:00.160 --> 00:40:02.230 align:middle line:84%
the pill for every ill,
the materialistic theory

00:40:02.230 --> 00:40:03.070 align:middle line:90%
of everything.

00:40:03.070 --> 00:40:05.050 align:middle line:84%
They finally show up
in Dr. Hitt's office,

00:40:05.050 --> 00:40:09.280 align:middle line:84%
completely lit up with
anger, and despair,

00:40:09.280 --> 00:40:11.350 align:middle line:84%
and frightened literally
almost to death,

00:40:11.350 --> 00:40:12.990 align:middle line:90%
because they're about to die.

00:40:12.990 --> 00:40:14.740 align:middle line:84%
And then they come in
to Dr Hitt's office,

00:40:14.740 --> 00:40:17.650 align:middle line:84%
and they would
unload on him, unload

00:40:17.650 --> 00:40:24.357 align:middle line:84%
all that American ferocity
of lies that they'd been fed.

00:40:24.357 --> 00:40:25.440 align:middle line:90%
And he would just take it.

00:40:25.440 --> 00:40:27.970 align:middle line:84%
He would just take it, and take
it, and take it, and take it,

00:40:27.970 --> 00:40:28.770 align:middle line:90%
and take it.

00:40:28.770 --> 00:40:31.270 align:middle line:84%
And finally he said,
are you ready to try

00:40:31.270 --> 00:40:33.490 align:middle line:90%
alternative medicine?

00:40:33.490 --> 00:40:35.590 align:middle line:90%
They'd be like, oh god, yes.

00:40:35.590 --> 00:40:37.610 align:middle line:90%
They'd be so exhausted.

00:40:37.610 --> 00:40:42.060 align:middle line:84%
And then eight weeks later,
they'd be back to work.

00:40:42.060 --> 00:40:45.330 align:middle line:84%
10 weeks later, they'd
be back to work.

00:40:45.330 --> 00:40:46.680 align:middle line:90%
I've seen that.

00:40:46.680 --> 00:40:50.700 align:middle line:84%
And underneath it, I'm watching,
and I'm looking, and I'm going,

00:40:50.700 --> 00:40:53.370 align:middle line:90%
what's causing this?

00:40:53.370 --> 00:40:56.650 align:middle line:90%
What's behind this?

00:40:56.650 --> 00:40:58.480 align:middle line:84%
These people can't
change their mind.

00:40:58.480 --> 00:41:00.350 align:middle line:90%
That's what's behind it.

00:41:00.350 --> 00:41:05.990 align:middle line:84%
They bought the story and
can't change their story.

00:41:05.990 --> 00:41:08.540 align:middle line:84%
The story got imprinted
when they were a child,

00:41:08.540 --> 00:41:10.700 align:middle line:84%
and they can't
change their mind.

00:41:10.700 --> 00:41:12.180 align:middle line:90%
That's what's behind it.

00:41:12.180 --> 00:41:15.010 align:middle line:90%


00:41:15.010 --> 00:41:17.237 align:middle line:90%
So this group, we got smart.

00:41:17.237 --> 00:41:18.820 align:middle line:84%
We're going, I'd
better change my mind

00:41:18.820 --> 00:41:22.240 align:middle line:84%
before I get hit with the
cut, the burn, the poison,

00:41:22.240 --> 00:41:23.980 align:middle line:90%
the pill for every ill, right?

00:41:23.980 --> 00:41:24.870 align:middle line:90%
That's where I'm at.

00:41:24.870 --> 00:41:26.330 align:middle line:90%
I'm changing my mind quick.

00:41:26.330 --> 00:41:27.130 align:middle line:90%
What do you got?

00:41:27.130 --> 00:41:28.450 align:middle line:90%
OK, I'll try it.

00:41:28.450 --> 00:41:29.950 align:middle line:84%
It might not be the
best thing ever.

00:41:29.950 --> 00:41:30.850 align:middle line:90%
It might be the best thing ever.

00:41:30.850 --> 00:41:31.975 align:middle line:90%
But at least I'm trying it.

00:41:31.975 --> 00:41:34.320 align:middle line:90%
I'm trying something new.

00:41:34.320 --> 00:41:35.820 align:middle line:84%
Every time I sit
down with somebody,

00:41:35.820 --> 00:41:38.190 align:middle line:84%
I'm like, what have you
tried for your xyz, whatever

00:41:38.190 --> 00:41:39.400 align:middle line:90%
your illness is?

00:41:39.400 --> 00:41:43.570 align:middle line:84%
I've never gotten past
seven things yet, ever.

00:41:43.570 --> 00:41:44.760 align:middle line:90%
All these years.

00:41:44.760 --> 00:41:45.560 align:middle line:90%
Let's get a list.

00:41:45.560 --> 00:41:46.630 align:middle line:84%
We're going to get a
piece of paper out.

00:41:46.630 --> 00:41:49.020 align:middle line:84%
OK, what have you tried
for your xyz condition?

00:41:49.020 --> 00:41:49.820 align:middle line:90%
OK, one thing.

00:41:49.820 --> 00:41:50.440 align:middle line:90%
OK, I got that.

00:41:50.440 --> 00:41:50.950 align:middle line:90%
OK, two.

00:41:50.950 --> 00:41:51.370 align:middle line:90%
You tried this.

00:41:51.370 --> 00:41:52.170 align:middle line:90%
OK, three.

00:41:52.170 --> 00:41:53.395 align:middle line:90%
You got, OK, yep, four.

00:41:53.395 --> 00:41:54.250 align:middle line:90%
OK, got that.

00:41:54.250 --> 00:41:55.050 align:middle line:90%
Five.

00:41:55.050 --> 00:41:56.280 align:middle line:90%
OK, anything else?

00:41:56.280 --> 00:41:57.080 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:41:57.080 --> 00:42:00.330 align:middle line:90%
Well, this is only five things.

00:42:00.330 --> 00:42:05.290 align:middle line:10%
We've got about 100
things for you here.

00:42:05.290 --> 00:42:08.180 align:middle line:90%


00:42:08.180 --> 00:42:11.600 align:middle line:84%
Are you ready to try
alternative medicine?

00:42:11.600 --> 00:42:13.850 align:middle line:84%
He spoke with a real deep
gravelly voice, Dr. Hitt.

00:42:13.850 --> 00:42:16.340 align:middle line:90%
What a wonderful man.

00:42:16.340 --> 00:42:17.320 align:middle line:90%
That's chanca piedra.

00:42:17.320 --> 00:42:24.565 align:middle line:90%


00:42:24.565 --> 00:42:25.490 align:middle line:90%
Oh, man.

00:42:25.490 --> 00:42:28.280 align:middle line:90%


00:42:28.280 --> 00:42:30.830 align:middle line:84%
This is what you have to do
to change people's minds.

00:42:30.830 --> 00:42:33.140 align:middle line:84%
If you're not jumping
around freaking people out,

00:42:33.140 --> 00:42:36.620 align:middle line:84%
causing people to go
ah, pa-bring, pa-bing.

00:42:36.620 --> 00:42:38.090 align:middle line:84%
There ain't a
chance in the world

00:42:38.090 --> 00:42:39.465 align:middle line:84%
anything's going
to be happening.

00:42:39.465 --> 00:42:43.010 align:middle line:10%
imagine I get up
here and I'm like,

00:42:43.010 --> 00:42:47.330 align:middle line:10%
Vitamin B3 might be
an appropriate adjunct

00:42:47.330 --> 00:42:53.960 align:middle line:10%
to approaching several
neurological conditions.

00:42:53.960 --> 00:42:57.490 align:middle line:10%
We start the dosage at
50 milligrams first thing

00:42:57.490 --> 00:42:59.676 align:middle line:10%
in the morning.

00:42:59.676 --> 00:43:01.720 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to take
our purified water--

00:43:01.720 --> 00:43:04.880 align:middle line:90%


00:43:04.880 --> 00:43:07.370 align:middle line:84%
would you be-- look,
she's already running.

00:43:07.370 --> 00:43:09.203 align:middle line:90%
She's like, I can't take it.

00:43:09.203 --> 00:43:10.370 align:middle line:90%
I've got to get out of here.

00:43:10.370 --> 00:43:16.370 align:middle line:90%


00:43:16.370 --> 00:43:18.480 align:middle line:90%
That was a drop a coconut oil.

00:43:18.480 --> 00:43:21.290 align:middle line:84%
This is ginseng, Kirlian
photographic ginseng.

00:43:21.290 --> 00:43:26.070 align:middle line:90%


00:43:26.070 --> 00:43:28.770 align:middle line:84%
My friend Ron Teeguarden, local
guy here in-- you guys local?

00:43:28.770 --> 00:43:29.570 align:middle line:90%
You're in LA?

00:43:29.570 --> 00:43:30.590 align:middle line:90%
Who's in LA here?

00:43:30.590 --> 00:43:31.990 align:middle line:90%
OK, some of you, local in LA.

00:43:31.990 --> 00:43:32.790 align:middle line:90%
Where are you from?

00:43:32.790 --> 00:43:34.150 align:middle line:90%
>> [INAUDIBLE]

00:43:34.150 --> 00:43:34.950 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, cool.

00:43:34.950 --> 00:43:35.750 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:43:35.750 --> 00:43:36.982 align:middle line:90%
And you're from Dubai.

00:43:36.982 --> 00:43:39.190 align:middle line:84%
We have something really
amazing here in Los Angeles.

00:43:39.190 --> 00:43:41.790 align:middle line:84%
We have one of the best
herbalists probably

00:43:41.790 --> 00:43:44.700 align:middle line:84%
in the world, Ron Teeguarden
and his Dragon Herbs

00:43:44.700 --> 00:43:46.230 align:middle line:90%
here in Los Angeles.

00:43:46.230 --> 00:43:48.090 align:middle line:84%
And if you get to go
down to his office,

00:43:48.090 --> 00:43:49.290 align:middle line:90%
there's one on Robertson.

00:43:49.290 --> 00:43:50.832 align:middle line:84%
And then there's
one in Santa Monica,

00:43:50.832 --> 00:43:54.460 align:middle line:84%
I think on Third and
Wilshire or something--

00:43:54.460 --> 00:43:55.260 align:middle line:90%
Santa Monica.

00:43:55.260 --> 00:43:56.810 align:middle line:90%
Third and Santa Monica.

00:43:56.810 --> 00:44:00.515 align:middle line:84%
And Ron Teeguarden,
has this guy who

00:44:00.515 --> 00:44:04.410 align:middle line:84%
has supplied him for many,
many decades, American ginseng.

00:44:04.410 --> 00:44:05.910 align:middle line:84%
So he's talking to
this guy one day,

00:44:05.910 --> 00:44:09.020 align:middle line:84%
and the guy says, I've
got this really bad news.

00:44:09.020 --> 00:44:11.910 align:middle line:84%
I've got-- I think was a
multiple myeloma, like really

00:44:11.910 --> 00:44:14.160 align:middle line:90%
bad cancer, gnarly situation.

00:44:14.160 --> 00:44:16.200 align:middle line:84%
And this guy's already
like, I think in his 70s,

00:44:16.200 --> 00:44:18.520 align:middle line:90%
so it's not looking good at all.

00:44:18.520 --> 00:44:20.853 align:middle line:84%
And Ron's like, well you
have all this ginseng.

00:44:20.853 --> 00:44:21.770 align:middle line:90%
Why don't you take it?

00:44:21.770 --> 00:44:23.437 align:middle line:84%
And he's like, oh no,
I don't take that.

00:44:23.437 --> 00:44:25.700 align:middle line:90%


00:44:25.700 --> 00:44:28.940 align:middle line:90%
This is so American it's insane.

00:44:28.940 --> 00:44:31.760 align:middle line:84%
This guy's been a ginseng
hunter for decades,

00:44:31.760 --> 00:44:33.670 align:middle line:90%
doesn't ever take ginseng.

00:44:33.670 --> 00:44:37.180 align:middle line:90%
That's so American it's crazy.

00:44:37.180 --> 00:44:39.650 align:middle line:90%
And Ron's like, whoa.

00:44:39.650 --> 00:44:41.990 align:middle line:84%
But he's like, OK,
let's just do this.

00:44:41.990 --> 00:44:43.340 align:middle line:90%
Here's what I'm going to do.

00:44:43.340 --> 00:44:46.817 align:middle line:84%
I want to buy everything you
have, your whole collection.

00:44:46.817 --> 00:44:47.650 align:middle line:90%
You're going to die.

00:44:47.650 --> 00:44:48.620 align:middle line:90%
I'll buy your whole collection.

00:44:48.620 --> 00:44:49.940 align:middle line:90%
But I'll do this for you.

00:44:49.940 --> 00:44:51.950 align:middle line:84%
I'll make a medicine
out of your collection

00:44:51.950 --> 00:44:57.300 align:middle line:84%
and send it back to you just
for fun, if you'll take it.

00:44:57.300 --> 00:44:58.260 align:middle line:90%
Will you take the deal?

00:44:58.260 --> 00:45:00.030 align:middle line:90%
The guy took the deal.

00:45:00.030 --> 00:45:01.470 align:middle line:84%
So Ron gets his
entire collection,

00:45:01.470 --> 00:45:06.630 align:middle line:84%
100-year-old ginseng roots,
100-year-old ginseng root,

00:45:06.630 --> 00:45:09.450 align:middle line:84%
and starts sending
him back the medicine.

00:45:09.450 --> 00:45:11.400 align:middle line:90%
The guy is still alive.

00:45:11.400 --> 00:45:12.590 align:middle line:90%
The guy is still alive.

00:45:12.590 --> 00:45:14.362 align:middle line:84%
He started taking
his own medicine.

00:45:14.362 --> 00:45:16.320 align:middle line:84%
But Ron got a hold of
those 100-year-old roots.

00:45:16.320 --> 00:45:17.760 align:middle line:84%
So I'm over at his
office one day,

00:45:17.760 --> 00:45:20.025 align:middle line:84%
and he's like, here,
have a 100-year-old root.

00:45:20.025 --> 00:45:21.660 align:middle line:90%
I'm like, dude, I'll take that.

00:45:21.660 --> 00:45:25.110 align:middle line:90%
What-- let me try that thing.

00:45:25.110 --> 00:45:29.550 align:middle line:84%
That's when I really
got it about ginseng.

00:45:29.550 --> 00:45:32.120 align:middle line:84%
When you get the roots that
are like 90, 100 years old,

00:45:32.120 --> 00:45:33.000 align:middle line:90%
then you go, whoa.

00:45:33.000 --> 00:45:37.990 align:middle line:90%


00:45:37.990 --> 00:45:42.230 align:middle line:90%
What's going on?

00:45:42.230 --> 00:45:44.720 align:middle line:84%
Is that an experience
you want to have?

00:45:44.720 --> 00:45:48.140 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I'm hunting
for those experiences.

00:45:48.140 --> 00:45:50.560 align:middle line:84%
And then it's
being handed to me.

00:45:50.560 --> 00:45:51.360 align:middle line:90%
This is going on.

00:45:51.360 --> 00:45:54.670 align:middle line:84%
Actually, why don't we hand
some stuff out right now?

00:45:54.670 --> 00:45:56.020 align:middle line:90%
Do you guys want some stuff?

00:45:56.020 --> 00:45:56.820 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:45:56.820 --> 00:45:57.987 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:45:57.987 --> 00:45:58.820 align:middle line:90%
We're getting bored.

00:45:58.820 --> 00:46:00.180 align:middle line:90%
It's been 15 minutes.

00:46:00.180 --> 00:46:04.200 align:middle line:84%
Can you guys hang in there
another five minutes?

00:46:04.200 --> 00:46:06.560 align:middle line:84%
OK, so these are our
cacao beans from our farm.

00:46:06.560 --> 00:46:08.210 align:middle line:90%
This is raw chocolate beans.

00:46:08.210 --> 00:46:11.120 align:middle line:84%
This is certified organic
certified biodynamic chocolate

00:46:11.120 --> 00:46:12.800 align:middle line:90%
beans.

00:46:12.800 --> 00:46:15.433 align:middle line:84%
And it's a great
pleasure to hand them out

00:46:15.433 --> 00:46:16.850 align:middle line:84%
to you of two
different varieties.

00:46:16.850 --> 00:46:18.890 align:middle line:84%
I grow 29 different
varieties on my farm,

00:46:18.890 --> 00:46:21.740 align:middle line:84%
but these are two different
varieties that are in this bag.

00:46:21.740 --> 00:46:24.230 align:middle line:84%
And another thing
we're going to pass out

00:46:24.230 --> 00:46:27.680 align:middle line:84%
is our B12, which is the
myceliated B12, which is more

00:46:27.680 --> 00:46:29.060 align:middle line:90%
powerful than an injection.

00:46:29.060 --> 00:46:32.030 align:middle line:84%
I usually pass that out when
people start going like this.

00:46:32.030 --> 00:46:34.300 align:middle line:90%
[SNORES]

00:46:34.300 --> 00:46:38.560 align:middle line:90%


00:46:38.560 --> 00:46:43.780 align:middle line:84%
So we'll pass that out next,
because B12 is about energy.

00:46:43.780 --> 00:46:44.590 align:middle line:90%
Energy.

00:46:44.590 --> 00:46:47.740 align:middle line:84%
And the main thing that
B12 is it's about one third

00:46:47.740 --> 00:46:55.110 align:middle line:84%
of your red blood cell,
and it protects your heart.

00:46:55.110 --> 00:46:58.590 align:middle line:84%
What gets most
people today by far?

00:46:58.590 --> 00:47:01.170 align:middle line:84%
Yep, heart disease
kills more people

00:47:01.170 --> 00:47:07.330 align:middle line:84%
than all cancers combined
by a large margin.

00:47:07.330 --> 00:47:09.730 align:middle line:84%
Just think about
that one right there.

00:47:09.730 --> 00:47:12.430 align:middle line:84%
Heart disease is getting
more people than cancer

00:47:12.430 --> 00:47:15.130 align:middle line:90%
by a large margin.

00:47:15.130 --> 00:47:17.920 align:middle line:84%
So what's more important than
having a cancer-fighting diet,

00:47:17.920 --> 00:47:20.720 align:middle line:90%
a cancer-fighting protocol?

00:47:20.720 --> 00:47:23.500 align:middle line:90%
A heart-protective protocol.

00:47:23.500 --> 00:47:25.270 align:middle line:84%
Could this epidemic
of heart attacks

00:47:25.270 --> 00:47:27.410 align:middle line:90%
have something to do with this?

00:47:27.410 --> 00:47:28.730 align:middle line:90%
We can't look at that.

00:47:28.730 --> 00:47:31.440 align:middle line:84%
We don't look at anything
else, because this is real,

00:47:31.440 --> 00:47:33.730 align:middle line:84%
and anything that isn't
this can't be real,

00:47:33.730 --> 00:47:37.172 align:middle line:84%
because we have proof, and
our own proof proves it.

00:47:37.172 --> 00:47:39.630 align:middle line:84%
Could this be having something
to do with our heart attacks

00:47:39.630 --> 00:47:40.430 align:middle line:90%
and strokes?

00:47:40.430 --> 00:47:43.660 align:middle line:90%


00:47:43.660 --> 00:47:44.460 align:middle line:90%
Couldn't be.

00:47:44.460 --> 00:47:46.300 align:middle line:90%
No, there's no way.

00:47:46.300 --> 00:47:48.040 align:middle line:90%
They're not related.

00:47:48.040 --> 00:47:49.960 align:middle line:84%
Rudolf Steiner
predicted 100 years ago,

00:47:49.960 --> 00:47:53.200 align:middle line:84%
he was telling us that
this Ahrimanic deception,

00:47:53.200 --> 00:47:56.140 align:middle line:84%
the deception of materialism,
the deception that it's only

00:47:56.140 --> 00:47:58.055 align:middle line:84%
a material cause
of your condition,

00:47:58.055 --> 00:48:00.430 align:middle line:84%
there is no spiritual cause,
there is no emotional cause,

00:48:00.430 --> 00:48:02.890 align:middle line:84%
there is no mental,
attitude cause,

00:48:02.890 --> 00:48:06.040 align:middle line:84%
that only the materialism will
lead to an epidemic of heart

00:48:06.040 --> 00:48:08.750 align:middle line:84%
attacks and strokes, which
is exactly what we're

00:48:08.750 --> 00:48:09.550 align:middle line:90%
dealing with.

00:48:09.550 --> 00:48:15.340 align:middle line:84%
Because we're so materialistic
in the way that we think.

00:48:15.340 --> 00:48:17.440 align:middle line:84%
I need to take
some material thing

00:48:17.440 --> 00:48:20.380 align:middle line:90%
to fix some material problem.

00:48:20.380 --> 00:48:21.970 align:middle line:90%
Is that what's going on?

00:48:21.970 --> 00:48:24.520 align:middle line:84%
No, because it's much
deeper than that,

00:48:24.520 --> 00:48:27.280 align:middle line:84%
because you're a physical,
mental, emotional, spiritual

00:48:27.280 --> 00:48:28.390 align:middle line:90%
being.

00:48:28.390 --> 00:48:35.350 align:middle line:84%
There's many layers of you
that defies all descriptions.

00:48:35.350 --> 00:48:39.040 align:middle line:90%
We don't have categories for it.

00:48:39.040 --> 00:48:41.170 align:middle line:84%
Some of you have ever
done sacred medicines,

00:48:41.170 --> 00:48:42.480 align:middle line:90%
like the kambo frog medicine?

00:48:42.480 --> 00:48:44.962 align:middle line:84%
Anybody ever done the
kambo frog medicine?

00:48:44.962 --> 00:48:46.420 align:middle line:10%
The traditional
teaching on that is

00:48:46.420 --> 00:48:48.430 align:middle line:10%
that there's 12 of you
existing right now in 12

00:48:48.430 --> 00:48:51.550 align:middle line:10%
different dimensions, and when
you do the kambo frog medicine,

00:48:51.550 --> 00:48:54.280 align:middle line:10%
there is a moment, I know
this from experience, where

00:48:54.280 --> 00:48:57.640 align:middle line:10%
you will black out for
just one very quick second,

00:48:57.640 --> 00:49:00.010 align:middle line:10%
and then boom, the best
version of you out of the 12

00:49:00.010 --> 00:49:02.440 align:middle line:10%
is replaced into
you right now, this

00:49:02.440 --> 00:49:04.510 align:middle line:10%
is the traditional
teaching of kambo frog,

00:49:04.510 --> 00:49:05.560 align:middle line:10%
and brought into you.

00:49:05.560 --> 00:49:07.600 align:middle line:84%
And that's why for the next
like two, three, four, five,

00:49:07.600 --> 00:49:08.890 align:middle line:84%
six weeks, all your
luck's improved.

00:49:08.890 --> 00:49:09.490 align:middle line:90%
Everything's improved.

00:49:09.490 --> 00:49:11.157 align:middle line:84%
You're at your best
version of yourself.

00:49:11.157 --> 00:49:13.472 align:middle line:84%
You're like, what's
going on here?

00:49:13.472 --> 00:49:15.680 align:middle line:84%
Do we have any names for
the different versions of us

00:49:15.680 --> 00:49:17.390 align:middle line:84%
that are existing in 12
different dimensions?

00:49:17.390 --> 00:49:18.200 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely not.

00:49:18.200 --> 00:49:20.810 align:middle line:84%
That can't exist, because
we're too far into scientism.

00:49:20.810 --> 00:49:21.680 align:middle line:90%
That can't be.

00:49:21.680 --> 00:49:23.180 align:middle line:90%
That's not possible.

00:49:23.180 --> 00:49:26.798 align:middle line:84%
Scientism says only
the material is real.

00:49:26.798 --> 00:49:28.340 align:middle line:84%
Not the emotional,
not the spiritual,

00:49:28.340 --> 00:49:30.080 align:middle line:84%
not the other parts
of you that exist

00:49:30.080 --> 00:49:31.453 align:middle line:90%
in 12 different dimensions.

00:49:31.453 --> 00:49:32.870 align:middle line:84%
Isn't it nice to
know that there's

00:49:32.870 --> 00:49:36.050 align:middle line:90%
12 more dimensions of you?

00:49:36.050 --> 00:49:38.160 align:middle line:84%
We sense that's
true, by the way.

00:49:38.160 --> 00:49:40.660 align:middle line:84%
In our dream state, we sense
that there's another part of us

00:49:40.660 --> 00:49:42.410 align:middle line:84%
that's out there,
or more parts of us,

00:49:42.410 --> 00:49:43.640 align:middle line:90%
or maybe past lives of us.

00:49:43.640 --> 00:49:45.890 align:middle line:84%
But it's all
happening right now.

00:49:45.890 --> 00:49:48.010 align:middle line:90%
Has anybody felt that?

00:49:48.010 --> 00:49:48.810 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:49:48.810 --> 00:49:49.650 align:middle line:90%
We have the-- we--

00:49:49.650 --> 00:49:52.070 align:middle line:84%
so we dismiss it because
of the scientism.

00:49:52.070 --> 00:49:54.920 align:middle line:84%
That's why we dismiss
those kinds of ideas.

00:49:54.920 --> 00:49:57.470 align:middle line:90%
That's ginseng.

00:49:57.470 --> 00:49:59.730 align:middle line:90%
Who's willing to take ginseng?

00:49:59.730 --> 00:50:01.710 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:50:01.710 --> 00:50:02.820 align:middle line:90%
This is a goji berry.

00:50:02.820 --> 00:50:08.150 align:middle line:90%


00:50:08.150 --> 00:50:13.398 align:middle line:10%
In the Arizona desert,
for many years, sometimes

00:50:13.398 --> 00:50:15.940 align:middle line:10%
even twice a year, there will
be a production of goji berries

00:50:15.940 --> 00:50:18.830 align:middle line:10%
numbering into the billions--

00:50:18.830 --> 00:50:22.660 align:middle line:10%
so many goji berries
you will never be

00:50:22.660 --> 00:50:24.148 align:middle line:10%
able to get through them all.

00:50:24.148 --> 00:50:25.690 align:middle line:84%
You'll never be able
to eat them all.

00:50:25.690 --> 00:50:27.770 align:middle line:84%
All out there in the
wild desert, and nobody

00:50:27.770 --> 00:50:28.570 align:middle line:90%
goes out there.

00:50:28.570 --> 00:50:29.440 align:middle line:90%
Nobody touches it.

00:50:29.440 --> 00:50:31.000 align:middle line:90%
Nobody knows about it.

00:50:31.000 --> 00:50:36.170 align:middle line:84%
They grow right underneath
the saguaro cactus.

00:50:36.170 --> 00:50:37.920 align:middle line:84%
You know the big cactus
out in the desert?

00:50:37.920 --> 00:50:41.660 align:middle line:84%
Are famous cactus, the ones
with the big arms like that,

00:50:41.660 --> 00:50:46.680 align:middle line:84%
iconically represented on
numerous products, always found

00:50:46.680 --> 00:50:51.120 align:middle line:84%
as icons for companies,
found as icons for brands.

00:50:51.120 --> 00:50:54.330 align:middle line:84%
That cactus produces
the greatest super fruit

00:50:54.330 --> 00:50:56.820 align:middle line:84%
on Earth, the
saguaro cactus fruit,

00:50:56.820 --> 00:50:58.852 align:middle line:84%
right out there in
the Arizona desert.

00:50:58.852 --> 00:51:00.810 align:middle line:84%
And so every year we go
out there, end of June,

00:51:00.810 --> 00:51:03.892 align:middle line:84%
beginning of July, right around
4th of July weekend or before.

00:51:03.892 --> 00:51:05.850 align:middle line:84%
And we're out there
hunting the saguaro cactus.

00:51:05.850 --> 00:51:08.280 align:middle line:84%
And it provides its own
tool to pick its fruit,

00:51:08.280 --> 00:51:10.148 align:middle line:84%
because it's a big old
thing way up there,

00:51:10.148 --> 00:51:12.690 align:middle line:84%
and it has these long-- you find
the dead ones on the ground.

00:51:12.690 --> 00:51:14.580 align:middle line:84%
They have these
long ribs, and you

00:51:14.580 --> 00:51:17.655 align:middle line:84%
use that rib to hook the
fruit and pull it down.

00:51:17.655 --> 00:51:21.150 align:middle line:84%
It provides its own tool
to pick itself, of course.

00:51:21.150 --> 00:51:25.440 align:middle line:84%
And right growing around that
is the Arizona goji berry.

00:51:25.440 --> 00:51:29.200 align:middle line:84%
This whole thing is
the cosmic giggle.

00:51:29.200 --> 00:51:30.160 align:middle line:90%
This whole thing.

00:51:30.160 --> 00:51:31.180 align:middle line:90%
All of this--

00:51:31.180 --> 00:51:35.890 align:middle line:84%
I'm always like,
what is going on?

00:51:35.890 --> 00:51:39.260 align:middle line:84%
People are so stuck
inside their own story,

00:51:39.260 --> 00:51:40.337 align:middle line:90%
which is killing them.

00:51:40.337 --> 00:51:41.920 align:middle line:84%
It's not even doing
anything for them.

00:51:41.920 --> 00:51:43.570 align:middle line:90%
It's ruining their life.

00:51:43.570 --> 00:51:46.990 align:middle line:84%
But they're so addicted
to it that they can't even

00:51:46.990 --> 00:51:48.590 align:middle line:90%
change their mind.

00:51:48.590 --> 00:51:51.040 align:middle line:90%
It's like, what is going on?

00:51:51.040 --> 00:51:53.570 align:middle line:90%


00:51:53.570 --> 00:51:55.220 align:middle line:90%
And here's what we do.

00:51:55.220 --> 00:51:59.180 align:middle line:84%
All we do is we just say,
open your mouth and eat this.

00:51:59.180 --> 00:52:03.620 align:middle line:84%
Because when this starts going
in, this starts changing.

00:52:03.620 --> 00:52:05.120 align:middle line:84%
So over the years,
this has been one

00:52:05.120 --> 00:52:06.500 align:middle line:90%
of the best tools we've got.

00:52:06.500 --> 00:52:08.750 align:middle line:84%
You've got a husband,
wife, daughter, brother,

00:52:08.750 --> 00:52:11.362 align:middle line:84%
significant other, son,
anybody in your family

00:52:11.362 --> 00:52:12.820 align:middle line:84%
that's just completely
out to lunch

00:52:12.820 --> 00:52:16.310 align:middle line:84%
and you're trying to save them,
you just go, open your mouth

00:52:16.310 --> 00:52:17.110 align:middle line:90%
and eat this.

00:52:17.110 --> 00:52:22.070 align:middle line:90%


00:52:22.070 --> 00:52:24.560 align:middle line:90%
It could be a goji berry.

00:52:24.560 --> 00:52:27.140 align:middle line:90%
It could be an avocado.

00:52:27.140 --> 00:52:33.230 align:middle line:84%
It could be a super fruit
like the saguaro cactus fruit.

00:52:33.230 --> 00:52:36.920 align:middle line:84%
It could be something
maybe at the sprout stage,

00:52:36.920 --> 00:52:38.833 align:middle line:90%
like here, eat these sprouts.

00:52:38.833 --> 00:52:40.625 align:middle line:84%
It might be something
as simple as a salad.

00:52:40.625 --> 00:52:43.430 align:middle line:84%
It depends on the situation
and the person, right?

00:52:43.430 --> 00:52:47.900 align:middle line:84%
So you're just-- whatever--
like, for my dad,

00:52:47.900 --> 00:52:50.570 align:middle line:84%
this is totally
beyond miraculous.

00:52:50.570 --> 00:52:55.730 align:middle line:84%
I've got him now eating at
Mother's Market in Costa Mesa.

00:52:55.730 --> 00:52:57.830 align:middle line:90%
This is beyond--

00:52:57.830 --> 00:53:01.850 align:middle line:84%
I mean, my dad is like,
he eats at a diner

00:53:01.850 --> 00:53:03.770 align:middle line:84%
off the Jersey State
Parkway, because he's

00:53:03.770 --> 00:53:05.210 align:middle line:90%
from New York City.

00:53:05.210 --> 00:53:08.630 align:middle line:84%
He eats stuff like
roast beef sandwiches.

00:53:08.630 --> 00:53:10.340 align:middle line:90%
There's no sense of organic.

00:53:10.340 --> 00:53:11.630 align:middle line:90%
There's no sense of quality.

00:53:11.630 --> 00:53:14.090 align:middle line:90%
There's no sense of anything.

00:53:14.090 --> 00:53:16.250 align:middle line:84%
And he's eating at a
health food store now.

00:53:16.250 --> 00:53:19.040 align:middle line:90%
We've had-- it's a miracle.

00:53:19.040 --> 00:53:21.020 align:middle line:84%
People say every day,
oh, miracles, come on.

00:53:21.020 --> 00:53:22.430 align:middle line:90%
That's some kind of like--

00:53:22.430 --> 00:53:25.160 align:middle line:90%
that's a fantasy.

00:53:25.160 --> 00:53:27.350 align:middle line:90%
Are miracles a fantasy?

00:53:27.350 --> 00:53:30.050 align:middle line:84%
It's everywhere all
the time, omnipresent.

00:53:30.050 --> 00:53:32.210 align:middle line:84%
At this very moment
it's happening,

00:53:32.210 --> 00:53:33.890 align:middle line:90%
as much as we can handle.

00:53:33.890 --> 00:53:35.210 align:middle line:90%
It's all we can take.

00:53:35.210 --> 00:53:38.183 align:middle line:84%
It's standing room
only of miracles.

00:53:38.183 --> 00:53:40.100 align:middle line:84%
But the biggest miracle
I think I've ever seen

00:53:40.100 --> 00:53:43.903 align:middle line:84%
is my dad eating at
a health food store.

00:53:43.903 --> 00:53:45.320 align:middle line:84%
If you've given
up on your family,

00:53:45.320 --> 00:53:46.550 align:middle line:84%
like these people
are out to lunch,

00:53:46.550 --> 00:53:48.842 align:middle line:84%
they're not going to get it,
let me tell you something.

00:53:48.842 --> 00:53:49.980 align:middle line:90%
Do not give up.

00:53:49.980 --> 00:53:52.075 align:middle line:84%
Do not give up,
because you never know.

00:53:52.075 --> 00:53:53.450 align:middle line:84%
I mean, my dad's
like, yeah, I'll

00:53:53.450 --> 00:53:54.795 align:middle line:90%
meet you at Mother's Market.

00:53:54.795 --> 00:53:59.039 align:middle line:90%
I'm like,

00:53:59.039 --> 00:54:00.440 align:middle line:90%
[BLUBBERING]

00:54:00.440 --> 00:54:01.765 align:middle line:90%


00:54:01.765 --> 00:54:02.565 align:middle line:90%
Huh?

00:54:02.565 --> 00:54:03.365 align:middle line:90%
What?

00:54:03.365 --> 00:54:05.300 align:middle line:90%
He knows what a health food is?

00:54:05.300 --> 00:54:07.290 align:middle line:84%
Do you know what
organic food means, dad?

00:54:07.290 --> 00:54:09.345 align:middle line:90%
Do you understand that?

00:54:09.345 --> 00:54:10.145 align:middle line:90%
It's amazing.

00:54:10.145 --> 00:54:14.090 align:middle line:90%


00:54:14.090 --> 00:54:15.040 align:middle line:90%
It's the best ever.

00:54:15.040 --> 00:54:17.960 align:middle line:90%
OK, there's another Incan berry.

00:54:17.960 --> 00:54:20.480 align:middle line:90%
Look at that thing going off.

00:54:20.480 --> 00:54:22.700 align:middle line:90%
This is the Peruvian goji berry.

00:54:22.700 --> 00:54:25.250 align:middle line:10%
And so the Incan people
would, on their roads,

00:54:25.250 --> 00:54:27.500 align:middle line:10%
which are still
functional, they still

00:54:27.500 --> 00:54:29.000 align:middle line:10%
work better than
the roads that have

00:54:29.000 --> 00:54:30.770 align:middle line:10%
been put in in the modern age--

00:54:30.770 --> 00:54:33.360 align:middle line:10%
when Lucmabamba-- I was talking
about Lucmabamba last night,

00:54:33.360 --> 00:54:36.380 align:middle line:10%
which is the valley of lucuma,
when that road went out about

00:54:36.380 --> 00:54:40.070 align:middle line:10%
five or six years ago
because the glacier--

00:54:40.070 --> 00:54:42.770 align:middle line:10%
Veronica, I think, is her name--

00:54:42.770 --> 00:54:44.140 align:middle line:10%
the glacier above melted down.

00:54:44.140 --> 00:54:46.640 align:middle line:10%
And a whole bunch of water came
down, wiped out the bridges,

00:54:46.640 --> 00:54:47.720 align:middle line:10%
wiped out the roads.

00:54:47.720 --> 00:54:49.970 align:middle line:10%
Guess what they went back to?

00:54:49.970 --> 00:54:52.700 align:middle line:10%
The old Incan roads.

00:54:52.700 --> 00:54:55.190 align:middle line:84%
And so they just go hike
up, up, and over the hill

00:54:55.190 --> 00:54:58.460 align:middle line:84%
with their sacks of stuff,
come down the other side, boom.

00:54:58.460 --> 00:55:01.010 align:middle line:84%
The road that was going
around all that, so imagine

00:55:01.010 --> 00:55:03.950 align:middle line:84%
a finger coming down and rivers
on all sides and everything,

00:55:03.950 --> 00:55:06.890 align:middle line:84%
they have these old Incan roads
going up and over like that.

00:55:06.890 --> 00:55:09.560 align:middle line:84%
Not around the edge,
because around the edge

00:55:09.560 --> 00:55:11.570 align:middle line:90%
it could get washed out.

00:55:11.570 --> 00:55:12.470 align:middle line:90%
It's just smart.

00:55:12.470 --> 00:55:13.760 align:middle line:90%
It's genius, actually.

00:55:13.760 --> 00:55:14.720 align:middle line:90%
Think about it.

00:55:14.720 --> 00:55:16.220 align:middle line:84%
If water is up on
the top of a hill,

00:55:16.220 --> 00:55:18.545 align:middle line:84%
and it's flowing down
the hill this way,

00:55:18.545 --> 00:55:20.420 align:middle line:84%
and you have your road
going around this way,

00:55:20.420 --> 00:55:22.910 align:middle line:84%
there's many places where
it can get washed out.

00:55:22.910 --> 00:55:25.940 align:middle line:84%
But if you go right up
into the direction of flow

00:55:25.940 --> 00:55:28.520 align:middle line:84%
and then down the
other side like this,

00:55:28.520 --> 00:55:31.370 align:middle line:84%
there's not many places where
the road can get washed out.

00:55:31.370 --> 00:55:33.765 align:middle line:90%
Is that genius?

00:55:33.765 --> 00:55:35.390 align:middle line:84%
And that's how the
old Incan roads are.

00:55:35.390 --> 00:55:37.640 align:middle line:84%
It's just-- you know, all
these years looking at them,

00:55:37.640 --> 00:55:40.070 align:middle line:84%
I'm like, these people,
I mean, are we idiots?

00:55:40.070 --> 00:55:42.290 align:middle line:90%
What the hell is going on here?

00:55:42.290 --> 00:55:44.197 align:middle line:84%
We don't even know
what we've lost.

00:55:44.197 --> 00:55:45.530 align:middle line:90%
We have no idea what we've lost.

00:55:45.530 --> 00:55:46.905 align:middle line:84%
But then another
amazing thing is

00:55:46.905 --> 00:55:48.680 align:middle line:84%
we have no idea
what we can regain

00:55:48.680 --> 00:55:52.133 align:middle line:84%
and how quickly
we can regain it,

00:55:52.133 --> 00:55:54.050 align:middle line:84%
because we have so many
tools of learning now.

00:55:54.050 --> 00:55:55.550 align:middle line:90%
We've got video.

00:55:55.550 --> 00:55:56.780 align:middle line:90%
We've got books.

00:55:56.780 --> 00:56:02.270 align:middle line:84%
You can even show up to an
event like this, god forbid.

00:56:02.270 --> 00:56:04.812 align:middle line:84%
We've got incredible learning
tools that are working for you.

00:56:04.812 --> 00:56:06.770 align:middle line:84%
For example, some people
are auditory learners.

00:56:06.770 --> 00:56:09.320 align:middle line:84%
They can be driving in their
car it's drive time university.

00:56:09.320 --> 00:56:13.040 align:middle line:84%
Boom, they're just
listening to stuff, right?

00:56:13.040 --> 00:56:16.110 align:middle line:84%
And you're learning, learning,
learning, learning, learning.

00:56:16.110 --> 00:56:18.650 align:middle line:84%
This is how we regain
our soul, right?

00:56:18.650 --> 00:56:23.150 align:middle line:84%
Something about learning
brings your soul back,

00:56:23.150 --> 00:56:25.010 align:middle line:84%
because learning can
change your actions,

00:56:25.010 --> 00:56:26.630 align:middle line:84%
and actions can
change your destiny,

00:56:26.630 --> 00:56:28.790 align:middle line:84%
and destiny can
change your karma,

00:56:28.790 --> 00:56:30.740 align:middle line:90%
change your soul journey.

00:56:30.740 --> 00:56:32.330 align:middle line:84%
I've gotten addicted
to learning.

00:56:32.330 --> 00:56:33.410 align:middle line:90%
I love learning.

00:56:33.410 --> 00:56:35.570 align:middle line:84%
And when you have an
addiction to learning, jeez,

00:56:35.570 --> 00:56:38.270 align:middle line:84%
that is just something
special, because repeatedly,

00:56:38.270 --> 00:56:42.110 align:middle line:84%
over and over again, you're able
to go, OK, let me just open up

00:56:42.110 --> 00:56:43.493 align:middle line:90%
to grace and just take this on.

00:56:43.493 --> 00:56:45.410 align:middle line:84%
Doesn't mean we have to
understand everything.

00:56:45.410 --> 00:56:47.035 align:middle line:84%
Doesn't mean we have
to get everything.

00:56:47.035 --> 00:56:48.020 align:middle line:90%
We just-- we're open.

00:56:48.020 --> 00:56:49.970 align:middle line:84%
And when you're open,
there's a chance

00:56:49.970 --> 00:56:53.060 align:middle line:84%
a spark could get through
that can take you--

00:56:53.060 --> 00:56:54.980 align:middle line:90%
oh, yes, thank you--

00:56:54.980 --> 00:57:00.260 align:middle line:84%
take you on a ride to the next
greatest moments of your life.

00:57:00.260 --> 00:57:03.338 align:middle line:84%
And we call that
the best day ever.

00:57:03.338 --> 00:57:04.880 align:middle line:84%
All right, let me
have a sip of this.

00:57:04.880 --> 00:57:08.200 align:middle line:90%


00:57:08.200 --> 00:57:10.120 align:middle line:84%
These people, I
love these people.

00:57:10.120 --> 00:57:12.160 align:middle line:84%
Mountain Valley Spring
water tracked me down

00:57:12.160 --> 00:57:13.570 align:middle line:84%
because they had known
for many years I've

00:57:13.570 --> 00:57:15.445 align:middle line:84%
been going all over the
world telling people,

00:57:15.445 --> 00:57:17.290 align:middle line:84%
get the spring water
from your own spring

00:57:17.290 --> 00:57:18.970 align:middle line:90%
around your own house.

00:57:18.970 --> 00:57:21.390 align:middle line:84%
Everyone in LA is like, we
don't have springs around here.

00:57:21.390 --> 00:57:22.790 align:middle line:90%
There's no springs in LA.

00:57:22.790 --> 00:57:23.843 align:middle line:90%
Oh god, it's over there.

00:57:23.843 --> 00:57:25.260 align:middle line:84%
We have to do
something different,

00:57:25.260 --> 00:57:26.677 align:middle line:84%
because we don't
have any springs.

00:57:26.677 --> 00:57:29.030 align:middle line:90%


00:57:29.030 --> 00:57:30.530 align:middle line:84%
One day I'm doing
a class, I'm doing

00:57:30.530 --> 00:57:31.947 align:middle line:84%
the thing for
NutriBullet, and I'm

00:57:31.947 --> 00:57:34.040 align:middle line:84%
doing a class across
the street at Uni High

00:57:34.040 --> 00:57:36.500 align:middle line:84%
School right off Wilshire
Boulevard and Barrington

00:57:36.500 --> 00:57:37.895 align:middle line:90%
and Westgate.

00:57:37.895 --> 00:57:39.020 align:middle line:90%
I go over to the classroom.

00:57:39.020 --> 00:57:40.700 align:middle line:84%
The teacher is just
a wonderful gal.

00:57:40.700 --> 00:57:42.200 align:middle line:84%
And we'd been
doing events there,

00:57:42.200 --> 00:57:43.460 align:middle line:84%
and we'd been doing
NutriBullets there.

00:57:43.460 --> 00:57:44.502 align:middle line:90%
And we'd go in the class.

00:57:44.502 --> 00:57:46.900 align:middle line:84%
And the class, you
know, they know me now.

00:57:46.900 --> 00:57:49.790 align:middle line:84%
It was like a three-month run
on this particular incident.

00:57:49.790 --> 00:57:51.680 align:middle line:90%
And we're in there.

00:57:51.680 --> 00:57:53.720 align:middle line:84%
And the teacher
says, hey, do you

00:57:53.720 --> 00:57:57.162 align:middle line:84%
want to do the class
today out at the spring?

00:57:57.162 --> 00:57:59.830 align:middle line:90%
I'm like, what?

00:57:59.830 --> 00:58:02.415 align:middle line:90%
What are you-- huh?

00:58:02.415 --> 00:58:04.540 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, how about let's go
and take all the kids out.

00:58:04.540 --> 00:58:05.748 align:middle line:90%
Let's go to the spring today.

00:58:05.748 --> 00:58:08.160 align:middle line:90%


00:58:08.160 --> 00:58:08.960 align:middle line:90%
Spring?

00:58:08.960 --> 00:58:11.097 align:middle line:90%
You mean like spring water?

00:58:11.097 --> 00:58:12.680 align:middle line:84%
Said yeah, we'll go
out to the spring.

00:58:12.680 --> 00:58:13.360 align:middle line:90%
We've got all the kids.

00:58:13.360 --> 00:58:15.610 align:middle line:84%
We're going to do-- we're
going to go out and hang out

00:58:15.610 --> 00:58:17.770 align:middle line:90%
at the spring.

00:58:17.770 --> 00:58:19.470 align:middle line:90%
A spring here?

00:58:19.470 --> 00:58:21.450 align:middle line:84%
There's a spring
here, right here

00:58:21.450 --> 00:58:25.740 align:middle line:84%
at Wilshire and
Barrington and Westgate,

00:58:25.740 --> 00:58:27.150 align:middle line:84%
right in the heart
of Los Angeles

00:58:27.150 --> 00:58:29.580 align:middle line:84%
where every single
person in Santa Monica

00:58:29.580 --> 00:58:34.350 align:middle line:84%
has told me for 20 straight
years there is no spring here.

00:58:34.350 --> 00:58:36.332 align:middle line:84%
There's not-- we
don't have that.

00:58:36.332 --> 00:58:37.290 align:middle line:90%
Somebody else has that.

00:58:37.290 --> 00:58:40.950 align:middle line:90%
We don't have that.

00:58:40.950 --> 00:58:43.210 align:middle line:90%
And sure enough, I'm like, yeah.

00:58:43.210 --> 00:58:45.610 align:middle line:84%
OK, what do you mean
a-- let's go see it.

00:58:45.610 --> 00:58:46.410 align:middle line:90%
There we go.

00:58:46.410 --> 00:58:49.290 align:middle line:84%
We go out there, and
sure enough, right there,

00:58:49.290 --> 00:58:52.320 align:middle line:84%
Barrington and
Wilshire Boulevard

00:58:52.320 --> 00:58:57.410 align:middle line:84%
is a spring bubbling
out of the Earth.

00:58:57.410 --> 00:59:02.390 align:middle line:84%
And I was like, I'm
just like, aghast.

00:59:02.390 --> 00:59:05.810 align:middle line:84%
And all I can think
of is all those people

00:59:05.810 --> 00:59:11.300 align:middle line:84%
in LA over 20 years who told
me, we don't have that here.

00:59:11.300 --> 00:59:13.580 align:middle line:90%
That's somewhere else.

00:59:13.580 --> 00:59:14.660 align:middle line:90%
And guess what?

00:59:14.660 --> 00:59:18.380 align:middle line:84%
Every one of those
people was dead wrong.

00:59:18.380 --> 00:59:21.980 align:middle line:84%
It was right in their
backyard all along.

00:59:21.980 --> 00:59:23.360 align:middle line:90%
What a message.

00:59:23.360 --> 00:59:27.150 align:middle line:90%
What a shocking message.

00:59:27.150 --> 00:59:29.388 align:middle line:84%
So now every time I go by
there, I'm going down--

00:59:29.388 --> 00:59:31.430 align:middle line:84%
I'll come down Wilshire,
I'll go down Barrington.

00:59:31.430 --> 00:59:35.150 align:middle line:84%
Down Barrington on the
right-hand side is that school.

00:59:35.150 --> 00:59:36.980 align:middle line:84%
Right there is a
little parking lot

00:59:36.980 --> 00:59:39.770 align:middle line:84%
you can pull into when
the school is open,

00:59:39.770 --> 00:59:42.350 align:middle line:84%
and the springs are coming
right out of that parking lot.

00:59:42.350 --> 00:59:45.020 align:middle line:84%
There's four springs coming
out all over that property.

00:59:45.020 --> 00:59:46.970 align:middle line:84%
There's one they've got
it boxed in like this,

00:59:46.970 --> 00:59:49.310 align:middle line:84%
and it's coming through the
sand, and that's the big one.

00:59:49.310 --> 00:59:50.852 align:middle line:84%
But the other ones
that are around it

00:59:50.852 --> 00:59:54.590 align:middle line:84%
are right there in the middle
of Santa Monica all these years.

00:59:54.590 --> 00:59:58.200 align:middle line:90%


00:59:58.200 --> 01:00:00.110 align:middle line:84%
So when somebody says,
we don't have that.

01:00:00.110 --> 01:00:01.100 align:middle line:90%
I don't know.

01:00:01.100 --> 01:00:08.450 align:middle line:84%
I don't have-- it's just
more excuses of nonsense.

01:00:08.450 --> 01:00:11.000 align:middle line:90%
Everything is right around you.

01:00:11.000 --> 01:00:12.770 align:middle line:90%
Everything is easy.

01:00:12.770 --> 01:00:14.780 align:middle line:90%
The next step is obvious.

01:00:14.780 --> 01:00:17.600 align:middle line:84%
It's always being-- you're
always being guided to it.

01:00:17.600 --> 01:00:21.360 align:middle line:84%
It's being presented to you
over and over and over again.

01:00:21.360 --> 01:00:24.360 align:middle line:84%
All you have to do is just
get out of your own resistance

01:00:24.360 --> 01:00:28.460 align:middle line:90%
and just say yes.

01:00:28.460 --> 01:00:31.010 align:middle line:90%
Who says yes?

01:00:31.010 --> 01:00:31.810 align:middle line:90%
We don't die.

01:00:31.810 --> 01:00:34.370 align:middle line:10%
We kill ourselves.

01:00:34.370 --> 01:00:35.170 align:middle line:90%
We don't die.

01:00:35.170 --> 01:00:36.215 align:middle line:90%
We kill ourselves.

01:00:36.215 --> 01:00:37.840 align:middle line:84%
People will come to
you with your cure,

01:00:37.840 --> 01:00:38.530 align:middle line:90%
and they'll be like, here.

01:00:38.530 --> 01:00:39.410 align:middle line:90%
Here you go.

01:00:39.410 --> 01:00:39.970 align:middle line:90%
There's your cure.

01:00:39.970 --> 01:00:41.010 align:middle line:90%
There it is right there.

01:00:41.010 --> 01:00:42.860 align:middle line:84%
And Giselle will go
no, that's not for me.

01:00:42.860 --> 01:00:43.660 align:middle line:90%
I don't do that.

01:00:43.660 --> 01:00:46.440 align:middle line:90%
I'm going over here.

01:00:46.440 --> 01:00:47.800 align:middle line:90%
[INAUDIBLE] here's your cure.

01:00:47.800 --> 01:00:48.600 align:middle line:90%
Here it is.

01:00:48.600 --> 01:00:51.280 align:middle line:84%
It's being presented to you
again and again and again.

01:00:51.280 --> 01:00:52.960 align:middle line:84%
[INAUDIBLE] said, no,
that's not for me.

01:00:52.960 --> 01:00:54.280 align:middle line:90%
I'm going over here.

01:00:54.280 --> 01:00:57.050 align:middle line:84%
This is what's happening
all the days of our life.

01:00:57.050 --> 01:00:59.500 align:middle line:10%
Not only that, we don't get
like 28 lives or nine lives.

01:00:59.500 --> 01:01:01.870 align:middle line:84%
We get like,
probably 33, meaning

01:01:01.870 --> 01:01:06.390 align:middle line:84%
it will show up again, and
again, and again, and again.

01:01:06.390 --> 01:01:08.140 align:middle line:84%
We'll get into this
even more, because one

01:01:08.140 --> 01:01:10.360 align:middle line:84%
of my favorite
herbs is eucommia.

01:01:10.360 --> 01:01:12.520 align:middle line:84%
Any herb that
begins with an E-U-C

01:01:12.520 --> 01:01:14.770 align:middle line:90%
is some bizarre weird stuff.

01:01:14.770 --> 01:01:20.100 align:middle line:84%
Eucommia, E-U-C, is the
most prescribed herb

01:01:20.100 --> 01:01:24.570 align:middle line:84%
in the history of
pregnancy in the world.

01:01:24.570 --> 01:01:28.210 align:middle line:84%
It's a tree that's ooey
gooey rich and chewy.

01:01:28.210 --> 01:01:30.010 align:middle line:90%
The tree is gooey.

01:01:30.010 --> 01:01:32.770 align:middle line:90%
E-U-C-O-M-M-I-A.

01:01:32.770 --> 01:01:33.570 align:middle line:90%
It's like ginkgo.

01:01:33.570 --> 01:01:36.900 align:middle line:84%
It's one of the last
surviving members of its race.

01:01:36.900 --> 01:01:39.300 align:middle line:84%
The rest of its
race was wiped out

01:01:39.300 --> 01:01:42.240 align:middle line:84%
in cataclysms,
changes of the Earth,

01:01:42.240 --> 01:01:43.680 align:middle line:90%
but there's one eucommia left.

01:01:43.680 --> 01:01:45.870 align:middle line:84%
In Chinese medicine,
they selected that one

01:01:45.870 --> 01:01:48.495 align:middle line:90%
as being the one.

01:01:48.495 --> 01:01:50.120 align:middle line:84%
So I got some eucommia
trees this year,

01:01:50.120 --> 01:01:52.010 align:middle line:84%
and I started growing them
finally after all these years.

01:01:52.010 --> 01:01:53.240 align:middle line:90%
I like growing this stuff.

01:01:53.240 --> 01:01:54.005 align:middle line:84%
By the way, I don't
feel qualified

01:01:54.005 --> 01:01:55.680 align:middle line:84%
to talk about any of this
stuff unless I've grown it.

01:01:55.680 --> 01:01:57.490 align:middle line:84%
I've grown everything
I've just showed you.

01:01:57.490 --> 01:01:59.978 align:middle line:84%
You, name it, I've grown it,
because I'm a nutritionist.

01:01:59.978 --> 01:02:01.520 align:middle line:84%
I'm supposed to be
the one who grows.

01:02:01.520 --> 01:02:04.278 align:middle line:84%
It boggles my mind that
nutritionists will get up her

01:02:04.278 --> 01:02:06.320 align:middle line:84%
like, oh, maca's this,
that, and the other thing.

01:02:06.320 --> 01:02:08.403 align:middle line:84%
Oh, goji berries, this,
that, and the other thing.

01:02:08.403 --> 01:02:10.750 align:middle line:84%
Oh, Peruvian goji berry,
yeah, the Incan berry,

01:02:10.750 --> 01:02:11.680 align:middle line:84%
it's this, that,
and the other thing.

01:02:11.680 --> 01:02:12.870 align:middle line:90%
They've never even grown it.

01:02:12.870 --> 01:02:14.510 align:middle line:84%
They have no idea what
they're talking about.

01:02:14.510 --> 01:02:15.680 align:middle line:84%
Chocolate's this,
chocolate's that.

01:02:15.680 --> 01:02:16.550 align:middle line:84%
Chocolate's this,
chocolate's that.

01:02:16.550 --> 01:02:17.440 align:middle line:90%
They don't-- they never grew it.

01:02:17.440 --> 01:02:19.385 align:middle line:84%
They have no idea what
they're talking about.

01:02:19.385 --> 01:02:20.770 align:middle line:90%
Do you see what I'm saying?

01:02:20.770 --> 01:02:22.820 align:middle line:90%
Lucuma, they never grow it.

01:02:22.820 --> 01:02:23.660 align:middle line:84%
They don't know what
they're talking about.

01:02:23.660 --> 01:02:24.720 align:middle line:90%
Mucuna, they never grew it.

01:02:24.720 --> 01:02:25.460 align:middle line:84%
They don't know what
they're talking about.

01:02:25.460 --> 01:02:26.627 align:middle line:90%
Vanilla, they never grew it.

01:02:26.627 --> 01:02:28.846 align:middle line:84%
They don't know what
they're talking about.

01:02:28.846 --> 01:02:31.810 align:middle line:90%
Is this making sense to anybody?

01:02:31.810 --> 01:02:34.350 align:middle line:84%
I would never get up
in front of an audience

01:02:34.350 --> 01:02:36.920 align:middle line:84%
and talk about anything
unless I grew it.

01:02:36.920 --> 01:02:37.780 align:middle line:90%
I'm a nutritionist.

01:02:37.780 --> 01:02:39.190 align:middle line:90%
I mean, come on.

01:02:39.190 --> 01:02:41.610 align:middle line:84%
You see how absurd
the whole thing is?

01:02:41.610 --> 01:02:44.110 align:middle line:84%
Does it make-- is this-- are
you putting the pieces together

01:02:44.110 --> 01:02:47.327 align:middle line:84%
of the absurdity of a
nutritionist getting up

01:02:47.327 --> 01:02:49.160 align:middle line:84%
here saying, hey, you
should eat this, that,

01:02:49.160 --> 01:02:50.290 align:middle line:84%
and the other thing,
and eat this thing.

01:02:50.290 --> 01:02:51.220 align:middle line:90%
They never grew it.

01:02:51.220 --> 01:02:54.750 align:middle line:90%
They don't know what it is.

01:02:54.750 --> 01:02:59.210 align:middle line:90%
This is one that is just--

01:02:59.210 --> 01:03:01.310 align:middle line:90%
but I'll take the hits.

01:03:01.310 --> 01:03:02.510 align:middle line:90%
David Wolfe, he's a quack.

01:03:02.510 --> 01:03:05.940 align:middle line:90%


01:03:05.940 --> 01:03:08.600 align:middle line:84%
Meanwhile, people are being
cut, burned, poisoned.

01:03:08.600 --> 01:03:10.710 align:middle line:84%
You can't-- I've got to
have spies in hospitals.

01:03:10.710 --> 01:03:11.650 align:middle line:90%
No kidding.

01:03:11.650 --> 01:03:14.460 align:middle line:84%
I have spies in hospitals
who report to me every day

01:03:14.460 --> 01:03:16.920 align:middle line:90%
what goes on in hospitals.

01:03:16.920 --> 01:03:20.490 align:middle line:84%
This is beyond Frankenstein,
Mengele insanity.

01:03:20.490 --> 01:03:22.830 align:middle line:84%
It's the craziest
stuff you ever heard

01:03:22.830 --> 01:03:26.900 align:middle line:84%
of all time, the craziest
quackery of all time.

01:03:26.900 --> 01:03:29.650 align:middle line:84%
But meanwhile, David Wolfe,
oh, he grows his food.

01:03:29.650 --> 01:03:30.690 align:middle line:90%
He grows his own food.

01:03:30.690 --> 01:03:32.220 align:middle line:84%
He's trying to tell you
what that food does.

01:03:32.220 --> 01:03:33.020 align:middle line:90%
He's a quack.

01:03:33.020 --> 01:03:37.080 align:middle line:90%


01:03:37.080 --> 01:03:40.860 align:middle line:84%
But every chemical in the book
being injected to everybody,

01:03:40.860 --> 01:03:43.200 align:middle line:84%
that's perfectly
fine and normal.

01:03:43.200 --> 01:03:44.700 align:middle line:84%
They don't even--
the people who are

01:03:44.700 --> 01:03:47.250 align:middle line:84%
injecting have no idea
what they're injecting,

01:03:47.250 --> 01:03:48.480 align:middle line:90%
but it's all normal.

01:03:48.480 --> 01:03:50.790 align:middle line:84%
That's all-- that's
not quackery.

01:03:50.790 --> 01:03:52.887 align:middle line:90%
Meanwhile, eucommia trees.

01:03:52.887 --> 01:03:54.720 align:middle line:84%
So I got these eucommia
trees, and I finally

01:03:54.720 --> 01:03:56.370 align:middle line:84%
realized some crazy
about eucommia,

01:03:56.370 --> 01:03:58.440 align:middle line:84%
and that is it can
survive anything.

01:03:58.440 --> 01:04:00.120 align:middle line:90%
Eucommia trees are untouchable.

01:04:00.120 --> 01:04:01.050 align:middle line:90%
They're perfect.

01:04:01.050 --> 01:04:02.680 align:middle line:90%
Every tree is perfect.

01:04:02.680 --> 01:04:04.500 align:middle line:90%
There's no bug that touches it.

01:04:04.500 --> 01:04:06.870 align:middle line:84%
There's not a bug
that will bite it.

01:04:06.870 --> 01:04:09.350 align:middle line:90%
Nothing will touch it.

01:04:09.350 --> 01:04:10.490 align:middle line:90%
The tree is like, perfect.

01:04:10.490 --> 01:04:11.490 align:middle line:90%
It's a perfect specimen.

01:04:11.490 --> 01:04:14.180 align:middle line:84%
I was like, whoa,
OK, now I get it.

01:04:14.180 --> 01:04:20.210 align:middle line:84%
Because all of the suburbs
of Indiana, Illinois, Ohio,

01:04:20.210 --> 01:04:23.138 align:middle line:84%
many of the suburbs
of New England,

01:04:23.138 --> 01:04:25.430 align:middle line:84%
right on the streets when
you're driving down the road,

01:04:25.430 --> 01:04:27.830 align:middle line:84%
it's all eucommia trees,
one right after the other.

01:04:27.830 --> 01:04:29.360 align:middle line:84%
Eucommia has been
revived and saved.

01:04:29.360 --> 01:04:30.860 align:middle line:84%
It's been spread
all over the world,

01:04:30.860 --> 01:04:36.230 align:middle line:84%
but mostly in the suburbs
of America, strangely.

01:04:36.230 --> 01:04:37.040 align:middle line:90%
You know why?

01:04:37.040 --> 01:04:38.415 align:middle line:84%
Because every tree
looks perfect.

01:04:38.415 --> 01:04:41.100 align:middle line:90%


01:04:41.100 --> 01:04:43.650 align:middle line:84%
You're in a suburb, you want
every tree looking good.

01:04:43.650 --> 01:04:45.275 align:middle line:84%
You want the neighborhood
looking good.

01:04:45.275 --> 01:04:48.090 align:middle line:84%
So these landscapers are like,
let's just plant these trees,

01:04:48.090 --> 01:04:48.978 align:middle line:90%
eucommia trees.

01:04:48.978 --> 01:04:51.270 align:middle line:84%
So in these neighborhoods,
we've got people coming out,

01:04:51.270 --> 01:04:53.523 align:middle line:84%
and this is the point
I wanted to get to--

01:04:53.523 --> 01:04:54.940 align:middle line:84%
let's see if this
will hold there.

01:04:54.940 --> 01:04:56.490 align:middle line:90%
That's probably not safe.

01:04:56.490 --> 01:04:58.800 align:middle line:90%
You've got people coming out.

01:04:58.800 --> 01:04:59.732 align:middle line:90%
This is trippy.

01:04:59.732 --> 01:05:01.440 align:middle line:84%
And they're on their
walkers, and they're

01:05:01.440 --> 01:05:03.273 align:middle line:84%
like dying, and their
arthritis, everything.

01:05:03.273 --> 01:05:04.830 align:middle line:84%
And they're going--
they're mowing

01:05:04.830 --> 01:05:06.360 align:middle line:84%
their lawns spraying
glyphosate everywhere,

01:05:06.360 --> 01:05:07.275 align:middle line:84%
and they're getting
into their car

01:05:07.275 --> 01:05:09.390 align:middle line:84%
and they're driving
off the hospital right

01:05:09.390 --> 01:05:11.648 align:middle line:90%
underneath the eucommia tree.

01:05:11.648 --> 01:05:13.440 align:middle line:84%
Because not only is
eucommia the number one

01:05:13.440 --> 01:05:15.570 align:middle line:84%
recommended herb for
pregnancy ever in the history

01:05:15.570 --> 01:05:17.487 align:middle line:84%
of the world, but it's
the most important herb

01:05:17.487 --> 01:05:21.010 align:middle line:90%
by far for your joints.

01:05:21.010 --> 01:05:23.780 align:middle line:90%
By far.

01:05:23.780 --> 01:05:27.260 align:middle line:84%
So all my top people
like Novak Djokovic,

01:05:27.260 --> 01:05:29.990 align:middle line:90%
do you guys know Novak?

01:05:29.990 --> 01:05:32.370 align:middle line:84%
He's the top tennis
player in the world.

01:05:32.370 --> 01:05:33.170 align:middle line:90%
It's amazing.

01:05:33.170 --> 01:05:34.520 align:middle line:90%
I'll put up-- you watch.

01:05:34.520 --> 01:05:37.210 align:middle line:90%
Let me show you Novak.

01:05:37.210 --> 01:05:38.200 align:middle line:90%
There's Johnny.

01:05:38.200 --> 01:05:39.000 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

01:05:39.000 --> 01:05:39.800 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

01:05:39.800 --> 01:05:41.050 align:middle line:90%
>> [INAUDIBLE]

01:05:41.050 --> 01:05:41.970 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

01:05:41.970 --> 01:05:46.460 align:middle line:10%
>> [INAUDIBLE]

01:05:46.460 --> 01:05:48.270 align:middle line:90%
>> Boom, got it?

01:05:48.270 --> 01:05:51.740 align:middle line:90%
OK, let me get Novak up here.

01:05:51.740 --> 01:05:52.670 align:middle line:90%
Where is Novak at?

01:05:52.670 --> 01:05:58.540 align:middle line:90%


01:05:58.540 --> 01:05:59.710 align:middle line:10%
Let me see.

01:05:59.710 --> 01:06:00.580 align:middle line:90%
Oh wait, oops.

01:06:00.580 --> 01:06:01.690 align:middle line:90%
I put up the wrong thing.

01:06:01.690 --> 01:06:02.590 align:middle line:90%
Wait, what?

01:06:02.590 --> 01:06:03.790 align:middle line:90%
Oh, sorry.

01:06:03.790 --> 01:06:05.110 align:middle line:90%
Oops.

01:06:05.110 --> 01:06:06.640 align:middle line:90%
That's the parasite one.

01:06:06.640 --> 01:06:07.670 align:middle line:90%
That doesn't exist.

01:06:07.670 --> 01:06:08.320 align:middle line:90%
Let me get rid of that.

01:06:08.320 --> 01:06:09.165 align:middle line:10%
Sorry, oops.

01:06:09.165 --> 01:06:12.460 align:middle line:90%


01:06:12.460 --> 01:06:13.260 align:middle line:90%
Let's see.

01:06:13.260 --> 01:06:14.060 align:middle line:10%
Hold on.

01:06:14.060 --> 01:06:15.830 align:middle line:10%
Where is it?

01:06:15.830 --> 01:06:16.690 align:middle line:10%
Hello, please.

01:06:16.690 --> 01:06:17.490 align:middle line:10%
I am your friend.

01:06:17.490 --> 01:06:21.030 align:middle line:90%


01:06:21.030 --> 01:06:22.420 align:middle line:10%
It's in one of these.

01:06:22.420 --> 01:06:26.100 align:middle line:10%
It's probably-- oh.

01:06:26.100 --> 01:06:30.716 align:middle line:10%
Sorry, that didn't-- you
weren't supposed to see that.

01:06:30.716 --> 01:06:32.600 align:middle line:10%
Let me put this one away.

01:06:32.600 --> 01:06:33.400 align:middle line:10%
There we go.

01:06:33.400 --> 01:06:34.775 align:middle line:10%
OK, it's going to
be in this one.

01:06:34.775 --> 01:06:36.525 align:middle line:10%
OK, so we'll go back here.

01:06:36.525 --> 01:06:37.325 align:middle line:10%
Let's go to this.

01:06:37.325 --> 01:06:46.540 align:middle line:90%


01:06:46.540 --> 01:06:48.430 align:middle line:10%
So Novak calls me,
career-ending injury.

01:06:48.430 --> 01:06:50.260 align:middle line:90%
This is in October of--

01:06:50.260 --> 01:06:56.200 align:middle line:90%
this is in February of 2017.

01:06:56.200 --> 01:06:58.782 align:middle line:90%
And he's like, what do I do?

01:06:58.782 --> 01:06:59.990 align:middle line:90%
I was like, dude, no problem.

01:06:59.990 --> 01:07:01.220 align:middle line:90%
I mean, I didn't even really--

01:07:01.220 --> 01:07:03.053 align:middle line:84%
I hadn't followed tennis,
so I didn't really

01:07:03.053 --> 01:07:04.220 align:middle line:90%
even know who he was.

01:07:04.220 --> 01:07:05.470 align:middle line:90%
I didn't know who Federer was.

01:07:05.470 --> 01:07:06.330 align:middle line:90%
I didn't know any of those guys.

01:07:06.330 --> 01:07:08.080 align:middle line:84%
And now I'm full on into
it, because of Novak.

01:07:08.080 --> 01:07:09.745 align:middle line:84%
But he calls me,
career-ending injury.

01:07:09.745 --> 01:07:10.765 align:middle line:90%
He's like, what do I do?

01:07:10.765 --> 01:07:11.890 align:middle line:90%
I'm like, no problem, dude.

01:07:11.890 --> 01:07:13.390 align:middle line:84%
Let me just look
at your whole diet.

01:07:13.390 --> 01:07:14.320 align:middle line:90%
I'll come over there.

01:07:14.320 --> 01:07:16.950 align:middle line:84%
So I go over there to Monte
Carlo where he lives, and we

01:07:16.950 --> 01:07:17.950 align:middle line:90%
go over his whole thing.

01:07:17.950 --> 01:07:19.120 align:middle line:90%
We lay out his whole deal.

01:07:19.120 --> 01:07:21.520 align:middle line:84%
And it's like he has a
fracture of his serving elbow,

01:07:21.520 --> 01:07:23.620 align:middle line:84%
a compression fracture
of his serving elbow.

01:07:23.620 --> 01:07:26.500 align:middle line:84%
So the first thing I'm thinking
is he's got to get on eucommia.

01:07:26.500 --> 01:07:28.480 align:middle line:84%
So it was like, I was
in that kind of mood,

01:07:28.480 --> 01:07:30.430 align:middle line:84%
and I'd worked with
Serbians before,

01:07:30.430 --> 01:07:34.030 align:middle line:84%
like Nikola Mirotic, who's
a famous basketball player.

01:07:34.030 --> 01:07:35.860 align:middle line:84%
And when I first
talked to Niko, I

01:07:35.860 --> 01:07:37.637 align:middle line:84%
was kind of in a mood
of like, because he

01:07:37.637 --> 01:07:39.220 align:middle line:84%
had an appendicitis
issue, I was like,

01:07:39.220 --> 01:07:40.770 align:middle line:84%
dude you need to like--
if you're going to do

01:07:40.770 --> 01:07:41.890 align:middle line:90%
what I'm going to say, cool.

01:07:41.890 --> 01:07:43.300 align:middle line:84%
But if you're not,
I'm not going to--

01:07:43.300 --> 01:07:44.592 align:middle line:90%
I'm not going to waste my time.

01:07:44.592 --> 01:07:47.610 align:middle line:84%
It's like, you've
got to do it or not.

01:07:47.610 --> 01:07:51.460 align:middle line:84%
Your old world sensibility,
you're Serbian.

01:07:51.460 --> 01:07:52.630 align:middle line:90%
I know you can do this.

01:07:52.630 --> 01:07:54.520 align:middle line:84%
You just have to
either say yes or not,

01:07:54.520 --> 01:07:55.510 align:middle line:84%
because I'm not going
to waste my time.

01:07:55.510 --> 01:07:56.770 align:middle line:90%
And I was kind of in that mode.

01:07:56.770 --> 01:07:57.940 align:middle line:84%
And Niko is like, no,
no, no, I'll do it.

01:07:57.940 --> 01:07:58.750 align:middle line:90%
What do you want me to do?

01:07:58.750 --> 01:07:59.590 align:middle line:90%
I'll do whatever.

01:07:59.590 --> 01:08:00.940 align:middle line:90%
You tell me, I'll do it.

01:08:00.940 --> 01:08:03.700 align:middle line:84%
Now Niko in that particular
case came back six weeks later,

01:08:03.700 --> 01:08:05.217 align:middle line:84%
and was the best
player in the NBA

01:08:05.217 --> 01:08:06.550 align:middle line:90%
that second half of that season.

01:08:06.550 --> 01:08:07.680 align:middle line:90%
This is about five years ago.

01:08:07.680 --> 01:08:09.100 align:middle line:84%
He's still one of the best
players in basketball.

01:08:09.100 --> 01:08:09.970 align:middle line:90%
He left the NBA.

01:08:09.970 --> 01:08:11.770 align:middle line:84%
Now he's playing in
international leagues,

01:08:11.770 --> 01:08:13.395 align:middle line:84%
because he wants to
be with his family,

01:08:13.395 --> 01:08:15.220 align:middle line:84%
and he enjoys being
out of the NBA more,

01:08:15.220 --> 01:08:17.604 align:middle line:84%
because the NBA has a little
bit of things going on that

01:08:17.604 --> 01:08:18.720 align:middle line:90%
are other than excellent.

01:08:18.720 --> 01:08:21.729 align:middle line:84%
Anyway, so when
Novak contacted me,

01:08:21.729 --> 01:08:24.257 align:middle line:84%
I was kind of in that
same mode, of like, dude,

01:08:24.257 --> 01:08:25.840 align:middle line:84%
you're either going
to do this or not.

01:08:25.840 --> 01:08:26.970 align:middle line:90%
You can't be halfway.

01:08:26.970 --> 01:08:30.490 align:middle line:84%
You have to go all in or
it's not going to work out.

01:08:30.490 --> 01:08:33.550 align:middle line:84%
Novak, when I got into eucommia,
he's like, I'll get 50 bottles.

01:08:33.550 --> 01:08:37.779 align:middle line:84%
So he calls up Dragon Herbs and
he gets 50 bottles of eucommia.

01:08:37.779 --> 01:08:45.850 align:middle line:90%


01:08:45.850 --> 01:08:47.979 align:middle line:90%
Right there, if you--

01:08:47.979 --> 01:08:48.979 align:middle line:90%
do you know who this is?

01:08:48.979 --> 01:08:53.490 align:middle line:90%


01:08:53.490 --> 01:08:59.520 align:middle line:84%
Novak Djokovic is the number one
player in the world in tennis.

01:08:59.520 --> 01:09:03.899 align:middle line:84%
What he did recently in the
Australian Open was impossible.

01:09:03.899 --> 01:09:04.990 align:middle line:90%
It was impossible.

01:09:04.990 --> 01:09:06.032 align:middle line:90%
I mean, I couldn't watch.

01:09:06.032 --> 01:09:07.290 align:middle line:90%
I had to just listen.

01:09:07.290 --> 01:09:08.760 align:middle line:84%
After he lost eight
straight games,

01:09:08.760 --> 01:09:10.177 align:middle line:84%
I'm like, oh, my
god [MUTTERING]..

01:09:10.177 --> 01:09:11.760 align:middle line:90%
I'm just going to lay down.

01:09:11.760 --> 01:09:13.319 align:middle line:90%
I'm not going to look.

01:09:13.319 --> 01:09:15.750 align:middle line:90%
And he came back.

01:09:15.750 --> 01:09:19.170 align:middle line:84%
The mental power of
this guy is the highest

01:09:19.170 --> 01:09:21.840 align:middle line:84%
I've ever seen in any
athlete ever in my life.

01:09:21.840 --> 01:09:24.191 align:middle line:90%
And very, very interesting guy.

01:09:24.191 --> 01:09:25.649 align:middle line:84%
But when I said
this is what you've

01:09:25.649 --> 01:09:29.160 align:middle line:84%
got to do to start winning again
and get back in this sport,

01:09:29.160 --> 01:09:30.479 align:middle line:90%
he's like, boom.

01:09:30.479 --> 01:09:36.000 align:middle line:84%
He's all the way in, and
that's why he's number one.

01:09:36.000 --> 01:09:37.580 align:middle line:84%
He doesn't go,
well, I'll kind of.

01:09:37.580 --> 01:09:40.439 align:middle line:84%
Well, you know, maybe
I'll just try a little.

01:09:40.439 --> 01:09:42.210 align:middle line:90%
I don't really like that.

01:09:42.210 --> 01:09:45.439 align:middle line:90%


01:09:45.439 --> 01:09:47.111 align:middle line:90%
Is this making sense to anybody?

01:09:47.111 --> 01:09:50.340 align:middle line:90%


01:09:50.340 --> 01:09:52.830 align:middle line:84%
This is cosmic
giggle stuff here.

01:09:52.830 --> 01:09:55.260 align:middle line:84%
Another one, by the way,
who's on the same track,

01:09:55.260 --> 01:09:59.176 align:middle line:84%
another really good friend of
mine, 20 years, is this guy.

01:09:59.176 --> 01:09:59.976 align:middle line:90%
Boom.

01:09:59.976 --> 01:10:03.240 align:middle line:90%


01:10:03.240 --> 01:10:05.550 align:middle line:10%
This guy works harder
than anybody in Hollywood.

01:10:05.550 --> 01:10:07.470 align:middle line:10%
You think, oh no,
he's just got it easy.

01:10:07.470 --> 01:10:08.500 align:middle line:90%
He's Woody Harrelson.

01:10:08.500 --> 01:10:09.420 align:middle line:90%
There's no prize.

01:10:09.420 --> 01:10:11.050 align:middle line:90%
He's just the best ever.

01:10:11.050 --> 01:10:12.480 align:middle line:90%
He does not have it easy.

01:10:12.480 --> 01:10:16.962 align:middle line:84%
He makes three movies a
year, and he busts his ass.

01:10:16.962 --> 01:10:19.420 align:middle line:84%
When I finally tracked him down
in London a couple of years

01:10:19.420 --> 01:10:21.940 align:middle line:84%
ago, I was like, dude,
you're still in London?

01:10:21.940 --> 01:10:23.500 align:middle line:90%
What are you doing?

01:10:23.500 --> 01:10:25.340 align:middle line:90%
You've been here for a year.

01:10:25.340 --> 01:10:26.570 align:middle line:90%
He lives in Maui.

01:10:26.570 --> 01:10:27.910 align:middle line:90%
He doesn't want to be in London.

01:10:27.910 --> 01:10:29.140 align:middle line:84%
But he's like, no, I
had to do this film.

01:10:29.140 --> 01:10:30.010 align:middle line:90%
Then I had to do other film.

01:10:30.010 --> 01:10:31.427 align:middle line:84%
Next thing I-- had
his other film.

01:10:31.427 --> 01:10:34.850 align:middle line:90%
He's stuck in London for a year.

01:10:34.850 --> 01:10:35.990 align:middle line:90%
And I was like, jeez, bro.

01:10:35.990 --> 01:10:36.790 align:middle line:90%
Like, come on.

01:10:36.790 --> 01:10:37.873 align:middle line:90%
You've got to have a life.

01:10:37.873 --> 01:10:40.690 align:middle line:90%
This is crazy.

01:10:40.690 --> 01:10:42.275 align:middle line:84%
London is like, you
know, when you're

01:10:42.275 --> 01:10:44.650 align:middle line:84%
in the middle of that metropolis
versus this guy's toilet

01:10:44.650 --> 01:10:45.900 align:middle line:90%
is outside the jungle.

01:10:45.900 --> 01:10:47.800 align:middle line:90%
There's no walls.

01:10:47.800 --> 01:10:49.180 align:middle line:90%
That's where he's coming from.

01:10:49.180 --> 01:10:51.070 align:middle line:90%
You know what I'm saying?

01:10:51.070 --> 01:10:54.070 align:middle line:84%
So he's another guy who
realized over the years

01:10:54.070 --> 01:10:57.760 align:middle line:84%
that you can't just continue
to beat yourself up.

01:10:57.760 --> 01:11:00.280 align:middle line:84%
You've got to take the
steps to clean your body.

01:11:00.280 --> 01:11:03.050 align:middle line:84%
You've got to take the steps
to get the parasites out.

01:11:03.050 --> 01:11:06.320 align:middle line:84%
And we did a long parasite
cleanse last year, hardcore,

01:11:06.320 --> 01:11:09.400 align:middle line:84%
and water fast
together, 12 days.

01:11:09.400 --> 01:11:11.320 align:middle line:84%
And it's interesting
what happens

01:11:11.320 --> 01:11:15.540 align:middle line:90%
when you get deep into that.

01:11:15.540 --> 01:11:18.030 align:middle line:90%
And he knows.

01:11:18.030 --> 01:11:21.768 align:middle line:84%
He's like, I'm going
till the worms come out.

01:11:21.768 --> 01:11:22.810 align:middle line:90%
And guess what I'm doing?

01:11:22.810 --> 01:11:24.227 align:middle line:84%
I'm going till the
worms come out.

01:11:24.227 --> 01:11:25.770 align:middle line:90%
We're going all the way until--

01:11:25.770 --> 01:11:27.005 align:middle line:90%
those wormies are coming out.

01:11:27.005 --> 01:11:28.380 align:middle line:84%
Because those
wormies are wanting

01:11:28.380 --> 01:11:31.440 align:middle line:84%
to get a hold of
your mind and go,

01:11:31.440 --> 01:11:33.960 align:middle line:84%
hey, you probably
should eat this.

01:11:33.960 --> 01:11:35.470 align:middle line:84%
And you probably
should eat that.

01:11:35.470 --> 01:11:36.970 align:middle line:90%
Because guess what they want?

01:11:36.970 --> 01:11:37.770 align:middle line:90%
This and that.

01:11:37.770 --> 01:11:40.580 align:middle line:90%


01:11:40.580 --> 01:11:41.380 align:middle line:90%
Another character.

01:11:41.380 --> 01:11:42.550 align:middle line:90%
Another interesting character.

01:11:42.550 --> 01:11:43.350 align:middle line:90%
Let's see.

01:11:43.350 --> 01:11:48.030 align:middle line:90%


01:11:48.030 --> 01:11:49.830 align:middle line:90%
This is my farm.

01:11:49.830 --> 01:11:52.470 align:middle line:84%
Just to show you a little
bit, like chocolate growing.

01:11:52.470 --> 01:11:53.460 align:middle line:90%
It's chocolate.

01:11:53.460 --> 01:11:54.840 align:middle line:90%
Chocolate on our farm.

01:11:54.840 --> 01:11:57.660 align:middle line:10%
Chocolate, chocolate, chocolate.

01:11:57.660 --> 01:11:59.105 align:middle line:10%
That's chocolate and vanilla.

01:11:59.105 --> 01:12:01.230 align:middle line:10%
You can see the vanilla
wrapping and vining its way

01:12:01.230 --> 01:12:02.030 align:middle line:10%
up and around.

01:12:02.030 --> 01:12:04.440 align:middle line:84%
You see that vanilla
there with the cacao?

01:12:04.440 --> 01:12:06.750 align:middle line:90%
See it has those pointy leaves?

01:12:06.750 --> 01:12:10.440 align:middle line:84%
It's vining up and
it's gripping up.

01:12:10.440 --> 01:12:13.010 align:middle line:90%


01:12:13.010 --> 01:12:15.750 align:middle line:90%
Cacao pods.

01:12:15.750 --> 01:12:18.030 align:middle line:84%
That's right outside
the side of the house.

01:12:18.030 --> 01:12:19.510 align:middle line:90%
That's a chocolate tree.

01:12:19.510 --> 01:12:23.930 align:middle line:84%
That genetics right there is
from Honduras, the most epic

01:12:23.930 --> 01:12:24.780 align:middle line:90%
genetics.

01:12:24.780 --> 01:12:26.155 align:middle line:84%
I mean, that's
one of the things.

01:12:26.155 --> 01:12:29.010 align:middle line:84%
After all these years in growing
29 different genetic varieties

01:12:29.010 --> 01:12:32.790 align:middle line:84%
of cacao, I know a little bit
about cacao, a little bit.

01:12:32.790 --> 01:12:34.290 align:middle line:84%
And one of things
I know about cacao

01:12:34.290 --> 01:12:36.390 align:middle line:84%
is the Central
American varieties,

01:12:36.390 --> 01:12:38.940 align:middle line:84%
the Honduras varieties,
the Costa Rican varieties,

01:12:38.940 --> 01:12:41.050 align:middle line:90%
are incredible.

01:12:41.050 --> 01:12:42.927 align:middle line:90%
They are something special.

01:12:42.927 --> 01:12:44.760 align:middle line:84%
Totally wild genetics,
that one right there,

01:12:44.760 --> 01:12:47.310 align:middle line:84%
from the Cangrejal river
region of Honduras.

01:12:47.310 --> 01:12:51.012 align:middle line:84%
And when you cut that fruit
open, you're like, whoa.

01:12:51.012 --> 01:12:54.360 align:middle line:90%
It just reeks of nobility.

01:12:54.360 --> 01:12:59.310 align:middle line:90%
It reeks of nobility.

01:12:59.310 --> 01:13:01.410 align:middle line:84%
We finally broke
through on this one.

01:13:01.410 --> 01:13:04.650 align:middle line:90%
CBD, major breakthrough there.

01:13:04.650 --> 01:13:05.790 align:middle line:90%
They will do everything.

01:13:05.790 --> 01:13:07.048 align:middle line:90%
Who's they?

01:13:07.048 --> 01:13:08.590 align:middle line:84%
They will do everything
to stop this.

01:13:08.590 --> 01:13:09.390 align:middle line:90%
Who's they?

01:13:09.390 --> 01:13:10.600 align:middle line:90%
>> FDA.

01:13:10.600 --> 01:13:11.890 align:middle line:90%
>> And who's the FDA?

01:13:11.890 --> 01:13:14.650 align:middle line:90%
Every country has an FDA.

01:13:14.650 --> 01:13:16.540 align:middle line:84%
Every country has an
FDA that's installed

01:13:16.540 --> 01:13:18.850 align:middle line:84%
by the world
pharmaceutical interest

01:13:18.850 --> 01:13:22.360 align:middle line:90%
to stop herbal medicine.

01:13:22.360 --> 01:13:27.130 align:middle line:84%
Just to cut right to the core
of it, let's get real clear.

01:13:27.130 --> 01:13:29.570 align:middle line:84%
Every country has a
Health Canada, an FDA.

01:13:29.570 --> 01:13:30.370 align:middle line:90%
It doesn't matter.

01:13:30.370 --> 01:13:32.680 align:middle line:84%
You go to Iceland, they have
their little thing installed.

01:13:32.680 --> 01:13:34.710 align:middle line:84%
You go to Norway, they've got
their little thing installed.

01:13:34.710 --> 01:13:36.910 align:middle line:84%
The EU has their little
thing installed just

01:13:36.910 --> 01:13:39.160 align:middle line:84%
to make sure you can't
get the herbal medicine.

01:13:39.160 --> 01:13:42.910 align:middle line:84%
You can't get the real dosage
of the CBD or the coated silver

01:13:42.910 --> 01:13:44.880 align:middle line:84%
or whatever it is to
get the dose that's

01:13:44.880 --> 01:13:46.130 align:middle line:90%
going to knock out everything.

01:13:46.130 --> 01:13:50.000 align:middle line:84%
So you have to default
back into their stuff.

01:13:50.000 --> 01:13:51.970 align:middle line:84%
Unfortunately, when
people say, well, I

01:13:51.970 --> 01:13:54.440 align:middle line:84%
have to do this drug
or this antibiotic,

01:13:54.440 --> 01:13:56.440 align:middle line:84%
I had to do it and
blah, blah, blah,

01:13:56.440 --> 01:13:58.360 align:middle line:84%
what you did with your
money is you funded

01:13:58.360 --> 01:14:00.850 align:middle line:84%
your own demise, because
they took that money,

01:14:00.850 --> 01:14:04.120 align:middle line:84%
and they used it to corrode
the institutions of freedom.

01:14:04.120 --> 01:14:06.440 align:middle line:84%
That's what they're
doing with your money.

01:14:06.440 --> 01:14:08.560 align:middle line:84%
They're taking your money
and they're using it.

01:14:08.560 --> 01:14:10.420 align:middle line:84%
Well, it's just-- we'll fund
this little operation over

01:14:10.420 --> 01:14:10.570 align:middle line:90%
here.

01:14:10.570 --> 01:14:12.200 align:middle line:90%
We'll fund this propaganda.

01:14:12.200 --> 01:14:13.697 align:middle line:90%
We'll take these TV commercials.

01:14:13.697 --> 01:14:15.030 align:middle line:90%
We're going to get in over here.

01:14:15.030 --> 01:14:17.170 align:middle line:84%
We're going to lobby
this government this way.

01:14:17.170 --> 01:14:19.010 align:middle line:84%
That's what they're
doing with your money.

01:14:19.010 --> 01:14:20.927 align:middle line:84%
So the more money we
spend on pharmaceuticals,

01:14:20.927 --> 01:14:22.493 align:middle line:84%
the worse the
situation has gotten,

01:14:22.493 --> 01:14:23.910 align:middle line:84%
because they've
used it to corrode

01:14:23.910 --> 01:14:25.900 align:middle line:84%
the institutions of
freedom to such a point

01:14:25.900 --> 01:14:27.910 align:middle line:84%
today that it's
almost to the point

01:14:27.910 --> 01:14:31.362 align:middle line:84%
where they're going to be
force injecting you as adults.

01:14:31.362 --> 01:14:33.070 align:middle line:84%
You think, oh, no,
it's just a kid thing.

01:14:33.070 --> 01:14:34.390 align:middle line:84%
They're going to go after
the kids or whatever.

01:14:34.390 --> 01:14:34.870 align:middle line:90%
I'm safe.

01:14:34.870 --> 01:14:35.840 align:middle line:90%
I'm an adult. Uh-uh.

01:14:35.840 --> 01:14:36.640 align:middle line:90%
You watch.

01:14:36.640 --> 01:14:40.920 align:middle line:84%
Watch what's going to happen
with this coronavirus scare.

01:14:40.920 --> 01:14:44.190 align:middle line:90%
Oh, you didn't get that vaccine?

01:14:44.190 --> 01:14:46.740 align:middle line:84%
Well, now we're going to force
inject you at the airport.

01:14:46.740 --> 01:14:48.040 align:middle line:90%
>> All the adults.

01:14:48.040 --> 01:14:50.355 align:middle line:90%
>> The adults, yep.

01:14:50.355 --> 01:14:51.810 align:middle line:90%
This is their slot machine.

01:14:51.810 --> 01:14:53.740 align:middle line:90%
Ka-ching.

01:14:53.740 --> 01:14:55.190 align:middle line:90%
We just racked another trillion.

01:14:55.190 --> 01:14:55.990 align:middle line:90%
Ka-ching.

01:14:55.990 --> 01:14:58.240 align:middle line:90%
There's another billion.

01:14:58.240 --> 01:15:00.010 align:middle line:84%
Many people I know,
I know people--

01:15:00.010 --> 01:15:01.330 align:middle line:84%
I'm not going to give
the specific names,

01:15:01.330 --> 01:15:03.010 align:middle line:84%
but I know people in the
royal family in Europe

01:15:03.010 --> 01:15:05.260 align:middle line:84%
who work in the pharmaceutical
industry who don't even

01:15:05.260 --> 01:15:06.315 align:middle line:90%
know what they're doing.

01:15:06.315 --> 01:15:07.690 align:middle line:84%
They don't even
know the interest

01:15:07.690 --> 01:15:09.010 align:middle line:90%
that they're even working for.

01:15:09.010 --> 01:15:13.385 align:middle line:84%
They're just installed at
certain levels in the structure

01:15:13.385 --> 01:15:14.635 align:middle line:90%
of the pharmaceutical empires.

01:15:14.635 --> 01:15:17.375 align:middle line:90%


01:15:17.375 --> 01:15:18.750 align:middle line:84%
I'm listening to
this, going, oh,

01:15:18.750 --> 01:15:20.940 align:middle line:90%
this is interesting information.

01:15:20.940 --> 01:15:22.920 align:middle line:90%
Very interesting.

01:15:22.920 --> 01:15:24.753 align:middle line:84%
Over the years, picking
up this information.

01:15:24.753 --> 01:15:26.628 align:middle line:84%
So I'm just trying to
pass that along to you.

01:15:26.628 --> 01:15:29.130 align:middle line:84%
There is nothing coming out
of any pharmaceutical company

01:15:29.130 --> 01:15:30.700 align:middle line:90%
that can be good for you.

01:15:30.700 --> 01:15:31.500 align:middle line:90%
Why?

01:15:31.500 --> 01:15:33.720 align:middle line:84%
Because their
intent is all wrong.

01:15:33.720 --> 01:15:36.450 align:middle line:90%
Their intention is all wrong.

01:15:36.450 --> 01:15:40.140 align:middle line:84%
Now they've gotten so far
into greed, control, so far

01:15:40.140 --> 01:15:44.680 align:middle line:84%
into just palliatively
allaying the conditions.

01:15:44.680 --> 01:15:46.680 align:middle line:84%
So let's put a Band-Aid
on, another Band-Aid,

01:15:46.680 --> 01:15:48.138 align:middle line:84%
another Band-Aid,
another Band-Aid,

01:15:48.138 --> 01:15:50.393 align:middle line:84%
until somebody gets into
a real crisis, which

01:15:50.393 --> 01:15:52.560 align:middle line:84%
is happening with numerous
people all over the world

01:15:52.560 --> 01:15:52.890 align:middle line:90%
right now.

01:15:52.890 --> 01:15:54.825 align:middle line:84%
Even world leaders
who've been, oh, I'll

01:15:54.825 --> 01:15:56.900 align:middle line:84%
just take these benzodiazepines,
I'll just take these things.

01:15:56.900 --> 01:15:57.630 align:middle line:90%
I'll just take that stuff.

01:15:57.630 --> 01:15:58.920 align:middle line:84%
I'll take this other
thing over here.

01:15:58.920 --> 01:15:59.970 align:middle line:90%
It should be fine.

01:15:59.970 --> 01:16:01.290 align:middle line:90%
It's not fine.

01:16:01.290 --> 01:16:02.252 align:middle line:90%
It never is.

01:16:02.252 --> 01:16:04.210 align:middle line:84%
Next thing you know, they
have to go to rehabs,

01:16:04.210 --> 01:16:07.530 align:middle line:84%
they have to get all different
kinds of detoxification systems

01:16:07.530 --> 01:16:10.710 align:middle line:84%
going, including the
activated charcoal,

01:16:10.710 --> 01:16:13.418 align:middle line:90%
to pull that crap out.

01:16:13.418 --> 01:16:15.210 align:middle line:84%
It is almost impossible,
I would say, today

01:16:15.210 --> 01:16:17.085 align:middle line:84%
in this world, the toxic
level that we're in,

01:16:17.085 --> 01:16:20.430 align:middle line:84%
to detoxify yourself
without activated charcoal.

01:16:20.430 --> 01:16:22.050 align:middle line:84%
It would be crazy
to try without it.

01:16:22.050 --> 01:16:23.730 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I'm not saying it's
the only thing you should use,

01:16:23.730 --> 01:16:25.770 align:middle line:84%
but it definitely needs
to be in there, needs

01:16:25.770 --> 01:16:28.200 align:middle line:90%
to be a piece of the puzzle.

01:16:28.200 --> 01:16:31.380 align:middle line:84%
The way I'm looking at
the world in my situation,

01:16:31.380 --> 01:16:37.680 align:middle line:84%
everywhere I go, four activated
charcoals, five dinner out,

01:16:37.680 --> 01:16:41.190 align:middle line:90%
four, all the time.

01:16:41.190 --> 01:16:43.770 align:middle line:84%
Once you get to that
point, by the way,

01:16:43.770 --> 01:16:48.100 align:middle line:84%
where it becomes your default
position, where you go--

01:16:48.100 --> 01:16:49.933 align:middle line:84%
where you've taken
enough activated charcoal

01:16:49.933 --> 01:16:50.850 align:middle line:90%
you know what it does.

01:16:50.850 --> 01:16:51.930 align:middle line:90%
You know how it feels.

01:16:51.930 --> 01:16:54.330 align:middle line:84%
You know how it neutralizes
digestive distress.

01:16:54.330 --> 01:16:57.090 align:middle line:90%
You know how it neutralizes gas.

01:16:57.090 --> 01:16:59.842 align:middle line:84%
Once you know how
it neutralizes all

01:16:59.842 --> 01:17:01.800 align:middle line:84%
of the different things
that could be going on,

01:17:01.800 --> 01:17:04.290 align:middle line:84%
feelings of lethargy,
feelings of feeling

01:17:04.290 --> 01:17:07.677 align:middle line:84%
wiped out, feelings
of being lethargic

01:17:07.677 --> 01:17:09.510 align:middle line:84%
to the point where you
can't get out of bed,

01:17:09.510 --> 01:17:10.945 align:middle line:90%
or any of that stuff.

01:17:10.945 --> 01:17:12.570 align:middle line:84%
Once you've taken
enough of it, you go,

01:17:12.570 --> 01:17:15.540 align:middle line:84%
oh it's the default
first choice.

01:17:15.540 --> 01:17:17.940 align:middle line:84%
So you feel anything
coming on, charcoal first.

01:17:17.940 --> 01:17:22.487 align:middle line:84%
Then you go, OK, I'll take do my
herbs and all this stuff after.

01:17:22.487 --> 01:17:24.570 align:middle line:84%
Then you've gotten to where
you're supposed to be.

01:17:24.570 --> 01:17:25.170 align:middle line:90%
It's interesting.

01:17:25.170 --> 01:17:26.610 align:middle line:84%
It takes a few
years, because I've

01:17:26.610 --> 01:17:28.410 align:middle line:84%
had to drill-- good
friends of mine here in LA,

01:17:28.410 --> 01:17:29.430 align:middle line:90%
drilling it in to them.

01:17:29.430 --> 01:17:31.480 align:middle line:84%
Do this, take-- like
a friend of mine.

01:17:31.480 --> 01:17:36.600 align:middle line:84%
He had to take his daughter to
a jiu-jitsu match at like, 7:00

01:17:36.600 --> 01:17:38.035 align:middle line:90%
AM.

01:17:38.035 --> 01:17:40.410 align:middle line:84%
It's 4:00 in the morning, and
he's like, I feel terrible.

01:17:40.410 --> 01:17:41.210 align:middle line:90%
I'm dying.

01:17:41.210 --> 01:17:44.090 align:middle line:90%
I've got this-- ah!

01:17:44.090 --> 01:17:45.350 align:middle line:90%
No problem.

01:17:45.350 --> 01:17:46.910 align:middle line:90%
Take eight charcoals.

01:17:46.910 --> 01:17:51.030 align:middle line:84%
Eight 440 milligram
capsules of charcoal.

01:17:51.030 --> 01:17:51.840 align:middle line:90%
Dying, dude.

01:17:51.840 --> 01:17:53.290 align:middle line:90%
I got up at 7:00 AM.

01:17:53.290 --> 01:17:57.310 align:middle line:84%
[MUTTERING] Dude,
take eight more.

01:17:57.310 --> 01:17:59.830 align:middle line:84%
I think he did 18, and then all
of a sudden, the whole thing

01:17:59.830 --> 01:18:00.738 align:middle line:90%
turned.

01:18:00.738 --> 01:18:03.280 align:middle line:84%
And then I talked to him later,
and he's like oh, no, no, no.

01:18:03.280 --> 01:18:04.080 align:middle line:90%
I'm fine.

01:18:04.080 --> 01:18:06.810 align:middle line:90%


01:18:06.810 --> 01:18:08.110 align:middle line:90%
I was like, interesting.

01:18:08.110 --> 01:18:10.853 align:middle line:84%
Now I go over there, and I'm
like, where's your enzymes?

01:18:10.853 --> 01:18:13.270 align:middle line:84%
He's like, oh, I don't know
where-- we don't have enzymes.

01:18:13.270 --> 01:18:14.145 align:middle line:90%
But we have charcoal.

01:18:14.145 --> 01:18:16.310 align:middle line:90%
You want charcoal?

01:18:16.310 --> 01:18:18.740 align:middle line:84%
It's not just when you
feel an upset stomach.

01:18:18.740 --> 01:18:21.650 align:middle line:84%
It's anything all
day long, because we

01:18:21.650 --> 01:18:23.450 align:middle line:90%
live in a toxic soup.

01:18:23.450 --> 01:18:25.580 align:middle line:84%
Every day we're breathing
automobile exhaust.

01:18:25.580 --> 01:18:28.047 align:middle line:84%
Every single day there's
toxins all every direction.

01:18:28.047 --> 01:18:30.380 align:middle line:84%
You can't even believe what's
coming through the floors,

01:18:30.380 --> 01:18:31.180 align:middle line:90%
through this.

01:18:31.180 --> 01:18:33.590 align:middle line:84%
This room right here for
sure is contaminated with 30

01:18:33.590 --> 01:18:35.330 align:middle line:90%
volatile organic compounds.

01:18:35.330 --> 01:18:36.800 align:middle line:90%
We've tested it, actually.

01:18:36.800 --> 01:18:40.370 align:middle line:84%
Every single building tested has
30 volatile organic compounds

01:18:40.370 --> 01:18:41.990 align:middle line:90%
in it.

01:18:41.990 --> 01:18:43.275 align:middle line:90%
30 of 30, actually.

01:18:43.275 --> 01:18:44.650 align:middle line:84%
I did that with
Christopher years

01:18:44.650 --> 01:18:46.990 align:middle line:90%
ago for a longevity conference.

01:18:46.990 --> 01:18:47.820 align:middle line:90%
30 of 30.

01:18:47.820 --> 01:18:52.460 align:middle line:84%
30 volatile organic compounds
in 30 buildings tested.

01:18:52.460 --> 01:18:55.490 align:middle line:90%
Let's keep going.

01:18:55.490 --> 01:18:56.802 align:middle line:90%
This is so good.

01:18:56.802 --> 01:18:58.010 align:middle line:10%
Look at that black substance.

01:18:58.010 --> 01:19:00.250 align:middle line:10%
What's that?

01:19:00.250 --> 01:19:01.640 align:middle line:10%
Chaga.

01:19:01.640 --> 01:19:03.680 align:middle line:10%
My goal for you is to
get you to the point

01:19:03.680 --> 01:19:05.780 align:middle line:10%
where you have healed yourself.

01:19:05.780 --> 01:19:08.180 align:middle line:90%
You know how to heal yourself.

01:19:08.180 --> 01:19:09.290 align:middle line:90%
You know what to do.

01:19:09.290 --> 01:19:13.603 align:middle line:90%


01:19:13.603 --> 01:19:14.520 align:middle line:10%
Where's my color cure?

01:19:14.520 --> 01:19:20.990 align:middle line:90%


01:19:20.990 --> 01:19:22.040 align:middle line:90%
Bam.

01:19:22.040 --> 01:19:24.980 align:middle line:90%
This is the color code.

01:19:24.980 --> 01:19:27.290 align:middle line:84%
You've heard of the
doctrine of signatures.

01:19:27.290 --> 01:19:31.160 align:middle line:84%
You may have heard that
the shape of the food,

01:19:31.160 --> 01:19:36.530 align:middle line:84%
the texture of the food,
the feel, and weight,

01:19:36.530 --> 01:19:40.460 align:middle line:84%
and look of the food tells
you what it does, right?

01:19:40.460 --> 01:19:41.335 align:middle line:90%
We've all heard that.

01:19:41.335 --> 01:19:43.668 align:middle line:84%
There's nothing more obvious
than the color of the food.

01:19:43.668 --> 01:19:45.620 align:middle line:84%
That's the most
obvious thing there is.

01:19:45.620 --> 01:19:46.910 align:middle line:84%
You get to the color,
the color tells you

01:19:46.910 --> 01:19:48.077 align:middle line:90%
everything you need to know.

01:19:48.077 --> 01:19:48.877 align:middle line:90%
Black is longevity.

01:19:48.877 --> 01:19:50.335 align:middle line:84%
You look at charcoal,
you go black.

01:19:50.335 --> 01:19:51.220 align:middle line:90%
It's longevity.

01:19:51.220 --> 01:19:52.790 align:middle line:84%
There's nothing going to
increase your longevity

01:19:52.790 --> 01:19:53.510 align:middle line:90%
more than charcoal.

01:19:53.510 --> 01:19:55.580 align:middle line:84%
We'll never find another
nutraceutical, another thing

01:19:55.580 --> 01:19:56.520 align:middle line:84%
that's going to come
along that's going

01:19:56.520 --> 01:19:59.090 align:middle line:84%
to be better than charcoal
for you for longevity.

01:19:59.090 --> 01:19:59.890 align:middle line:90%
Black.

01:19:59.890 --> 01:20:00.890 align:middle line:90%
What color is chaga?

01:20:00.890 --> 01:20:01.690 align:middle line:90%
Black.

01:20:01.690 --> 01:20:02.690 align:middle line:90%
Increases longevity.

01:20:02.690 --> 01:20:08.160 align:middle line:90%
What color is black cumin oil?

01:20:08.160 --> 01:20:08.960 align:middle line:90%
Black seed oil.

01:20:08.960 --> 01:20:10.557 align:middle line:90%
It's black, right?

01:20:10.557 --> 01:20:11.640 align:middle line:90%
You go to the Middle East.

01:20:11.640 --> 01:20:12.932 align:middle line:90%
It's a cure-all for everything.

01:20:12.932 --> 01:20:15.400 align:middle line:84%
Oh, that's interesting,
because it's black.

01:20:15.400 --> 01:20:19.364 align:middle line:90%
Whoa, that was cool.

01:20:19.364 --> 01:20:22.661 align:middle line:90%
>> [INAUDIBLE]

01:20:22.661 --> 01:20:24.080 align:middle line:90%


01:20:24.080 --> 01:20:25.290 align:middle line:90%
>> Black.

01:20:25.290 --> 01:20:26.090 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

01:20:26.090 --> 01:20:27.800 align:middle line:84%
OK, so this is such
a great question.

01:20:27.800 --> 01:20:29.090 align:middle line:90%
Thank you for that question.

01:20:29.090 --> 01:20:32.390 align:middle line:84%
What do we do against
EMF sensitivity?

01:20:32.390 --> 01:20:34.820 align:middle line:84%
As I mentioned before, I
mentioned this repeatedly,

01:20:34.820 --> 01:20:39.520 align:middle line:84%
to neutralize even a radioactive
phenomenon, what is used?

01:20:39.520 --> 01:20:42.190 align:middle line:84%
The number one thing
used is carbon.

01:20:42.190 --> 01:20:42.990 align:middle line:90%
And vodka.

01:20:42.990 --> 01:20:50.070 align:middle line:90%


01:20:50.070 --> 01:20:51.678 align:middle line:90%
It was, and vodka.

01:20:51.678 --> 01:20:53.720 align:middle line:84%
By the way, if you're
wanting to know, like, hey,

01:20:53.720 --> 01:20:55.310 align:middle line:84%
when I've got my
chaga over here,

01:20:55.310 --> 01:20:56.810 align:middle line:84%
what am I going to
do with my chaga?

01:20:56.810 --> 01:20:59.700 align:middle line:90%
Let's get back to this picture.

01:20:59.700 --> 01:21:01.210 align:middle line:10%
Right.

01:21:01.210 --> 01:21:02.490 align:middle line:90%
Chaga vodka.

01:21:02.490 --> 01:21:05.190 align:middle line:84%
There's two things about
these medicinal mushrooms,

01:21:05.190 --> 01:21:07.562 align:middle line:84%
and we've now some press
on medicinal mushrooms,

01:21:07.562 --> 01:21:10.020 align:middle line:84%
just like we've gotten press
on intermittent fasting, which

01:21:10.020 --> 01:21:11.580 align:middle line:84%
I've been telling
you for 20 years.

01:21:11.580 --> 01:21:14.790 align:middle line:84%
I've been at-- 20 years,
intermittent fasting.

01:21:14.790 --> 01:21:16.110 align:middle line:90%
Medicinal mushrooms.

01:21:16.110 --> 01:21:18.450 align:middle line:84%
Finally today we're
starting to get to the point

01:21:18.450 --> 01:21:23.100 align:middle line:84%
where it's like, whoa, this
mushroom is good for me?

01:21:23.100 --> 01:21:24.003 align:middle line:90%
What?

01:21:24.003 --> 01:21:25.170 align:middle line:90%
We're getting to that point.

01:21:25.170 --> 01:21:26.130 align:middle line:90%
We got there.

01:21:26.130 --> 01:21:29.010 align:middle line:84%
Now, in Russia, they've
always known all along

01:21:29.010 --> 01:21:32.250 align:middle line:84%
that you throw your medicinal
mushrooms into vodka.

01:21:32.250 --> 01:21:34.470 align:middle line:84%
The reason why that is
is because the alcohol

01:21:34.470 --> 01:21:38.190 align:middle line:84%
soluble fraction of the
medicinal mushroom, or the oil

01:21:38.190 --> 01:21:44.500 align:middle line:84%
soluble fraction, is
extraordinarily anti-tumor,

01:21:44.500 --> 01:21:48.660 align:middle line:90%
antiviral, and anti-metastatic.

01:21:48.660 --> 01:21:57.480 align:middle line:84%
So it stops the
spread of that one.

01:21:57.480 --> 01:21:59.890 align:middle line:90%


01:21:59.890 --> 01:22:01.390 align:middle line:84%
I'm so glad we're
in a free country.

01:22:01.390 --> 01:22:02.580 align:middle line:90%
We can speak our minds here.

01:22:02.580 --> 01:22:06.090 align:middle line:84%
I'm so glad there's
no censorship anymore.

01:22:06.090 --> 01:22:09.000 align:middle line:90%
It's amazing, isn't it?

01:22:09.000 --> 01:22:11.870 align:middle line:90%
OK, back to our story here.

01:22:11.870 --> 01:22:13.410 align:middle line:90%
Red.

01:22:13.410 --> 01:22:15.480 align:middle line:90%
This is the best ever.

01:22:15.480 --> 01:22:16.980 align:middle line:90%
This right here is so helpful.

01:22:16.980 --> 01:22:18.870 align:middle line:84%
This is so helpful
for your life.

01:22:18.870 --> 01:22:20.130 align:middle line:90%
It's so simple.

01:22:20.130 --> 01:22:21.560 align:middle line:90%
Everything is so simple.

01:22:21.560 --> 01:22:24.740 align:middle line:90%
Everything is the simplest ever.

01:22:24.740 --> 01:22:27.280 align:middle line:90%
Red food is blood, heart.

01:22:27.280 --> 01:22:28.250 align:middle line:90%
But it's volatile.

01:22:28.250 --> 01:22:29.810 align:middle line:90%
You have to be careful.

01:22:29.810 --> 01:22:32.860 align:middle line:84%
If somebody is really deficient,
really depleted, that's like,

01:22:32.860 --> 01:22:34.500 align:middle line:90%
OK, that's a red meat case.

01:22:34.500 --> 01:22:36.310 align:middle line:84%
But if you keep eating
red meat every day,

01:22:36.310 --> 01:22:37.977 align:middle line:84%
red meat, red meat,
next thing you know,

01:22:37.977 --> 01:22:40.134 align:middle line:84%
you're going to be
fighting people.

01:22:40.134 --> 01:22:41.980 align:middle line:90%
You see that?

01:22:41.980 --> 01:22:44.530 align:middle line:84%
It's just--
everything's so obvious.

01:22:44.530 --> 01:22:46.030 align:middle line:90%
Orange, anti-inflammatory.

01:22:46.030 --> 01:22:47.140 align:middle line:90%
Happiness in action.

01:22:47.140 --> 01:22:48.250 align:middle line:10%
That's what orange is.

01:22:48.250 --> 01:22:50.110 align:middle line:84%
Yellow, tissue
building, tissue repair,

01:22:50.110 --> 01:22:52.190 align:middle line:90%
immune system development.

01:22:52.190 --> 01:22:56.380 align:middle line:84%
Green, neutralizer,
deodorizer, detoxifier.

01:22:56.380 --> 01:22:59.650 align:middle line:84%
So green foods,
right, that's heart.

01:22:59.650 --> 01:23:02.860 align:middle line:84%
The Green Party I
love the Green Party,

01:23:02.860 --> 01:23:04.610 align:middle line:84%
but it's nowhere near
the chocolate party.

01:23:04.610 --> 01:23:07.170 align:middle line:90%


01:23:07.170 --> 01:23:09.170 align:middle line:84%
People are like, can I
join the chocolate party?

01:23:09.170 --> 01:23:10.795 align:middle line:84%
And it's like, yeah,
you're already in.

01:23:10.795 --> 01:23:12.980 align:middle line:90%
There's no paperwork.

01:23:12.980 --> 01:23:13.780 align:middle line:90%
You don't need ID.

01:23:13.780 --> 01:23:14.670 align:middle line:90%
You don't need paperwork.

01:23:14.670 --> 01:23:15.450 align:middle line:90%
We got rid of all that.

01:23:15.450 --> 01:23:16.560 align:middle line:90%
We're getting rid of all that.

01:23:16.560 --> 01:23:18.268 align:middle line:84%
And that's, by the
way, a very good thing

01:23:18.268 --> 01:23:19.380 align:middle line:90%
to be saying all the time.

01:23:19.380 --> 01:23:21.510 align:middle line:84%
When people are like, well, you
have to sign this and do this,

01:23:21.510 --> 01:23:22.460 align:middle line:90%
you're like, no, no, no, no, no.

01:23:22.460 --> 01:23:23.850 align:middle line:90%
We're not signing anything.

01:23:23.850 --> 01:23:25.740 align:middle line:90%
We're getting rid of all that.

01:23:25.740 --> 01:23:27.245 align:middle line:90%
There's no more paperwork.

01:23:27.245 --> 01:23:28.620 align:middle line:84%
We're getting rid
of bureaucracy.

01:23:28.620 --> 01:23:30.420 align:middle line:90%
We're throwing it all away.

01:23:30.420 --> 01:23:31.890 align:middle line:90%
We don't need it anymore.

01:23:31.890 --> 01:23:33.150 align:middle line:90%
Where are your papers?

01:23:33.150 --> 01:23:36.240 align:middle line:84%
We are getting
rid of our papers.

01:23:36.240 --> 01:23:37.448 align:middle line:90%
Where is your passport?

01:23:37.448 --> 01:23:38.865 align:middle line:84%
We're getting rid
of our passport.

01:23:38.865 --> 01:23:42.730 align:middle line:90%


01:23:42.730 --> 01:23:44.080 align:middle line:90%
Where is your ID?

01:23:44.080 --> 01:23:45.080 align:middle line:90%
We're getting rid of it.

01:23:45.080 --> 01:23:45.880 align:middle line:90%
We don't need it.

01:23:45.880 --> 01:23:48.936 align:middle line:90%


01:23:48.936 --> 01:23:49.820 align:middle line:90%
Let's keep going.

01:23:49.820 --> 01:23:53.480 align:middle line:90%


01:23:53.480 --> 01:23:57.560 align:middle line:84%
The hardest color for
nature to produce is blue.

01:23:57.560 --> 01:24:00.890 align:middle line:10%
Blue will almost always
be faked by nature.

01:24:00.890 --> 01:24:02.283 align:middle line:10%
Nature will fake it.

01:24:02.283 --> 01:24:04.200 align:middle line:10%
So for example, you
think, OK, I've seen blue.

01:24:04.200 --> 01:24:05.730 align:middle line:10%
There's a blue feather.

01:24:05.730 --> 01:24:06.980 align:middle line:10%
But then you change the angle.

01:24:06.980 --> 01:24:09.800 align:middle line:10%
The feather doesn't change,
yet it turns to red,

01:24:09.800 --> 01:24:11.070 align:middle line:10%
or it turns to brown or green.

01:24:11.070 --> 01:24:11.690 align:middle line:10%
You're like, wait a second.

01:24:11.690 --> 01:24:11.870 align:middle line:10%
What?

01:24:11.870 --> 01:24:12.980 align:middle line:10%
I thought that was
a blue feather.

01:24:12.980 --> 01:24:14.180 align:middle line:10%
That's not a blue feather.

01:24:14.180 --> 01:24:15.860 align:middle line:10%
What's going on
with that feather?

01:24:15.860 --> 01:24:17.150 align:middle line:10%
It's a fake.

01:24:17.150 --> 01:24:18.650 align:middle line:10%
It's called a
structural coloration.

01:24:18.650 --> 01:24:20.067 align:middle line:10%
The structure of
the feather makes

01:24:20.067 --> 01:24:21.950 align:middle line:10%
you look, and tricks
your eye into seeing

01:24:21.950 --> 01:24:24.120 align:middle line:10%
blue, or red, or green.

01:24:24.120 --> 01:24:25.417 align:middle line:10%
But it's really actually brown.

01:24:25.417 --> 01:24:26.750 align:middle line:10%
This is the same with blue eyes.

01:24:26.750 --> 01:24:27.708 align:middle line:10%
There are no blue eyes.

01:24:27.708 --> 01:24:30.110 align:middle line:10%
It's just layers of browns
in three different layers,

01:24:30.110 --> 01:24:31.010 align:middle line:10%
basically.

01:24:31.010 --> 01:24:32.060 align:middle line:10%
So it's a refraction.

01:24:32.060 --> 01:24:35.250 align:middle line:10%
It's a structural coloration.

01:24:35.250 --> 01:24:36.050 align:middle line:90%
Green eyes.

01:24:36.050 --> 01:24:38.720 align:middle line:90%
There's only brown eyes.

01:24:38.720 --> 01:24:40.730 align:middle line:84%
And it's the layers
of the melanin

01:24:40.730 --> 01:24:43.580 align:middle line:84%
in the three major
layers of the eye that

01:24:43.580 --> 01:24:45.033 align:middle line:90%
form the different color.

01:24:45.033 --> 01:24:45.950 align:middle line:90%
So we look at the eye.

01:24:45.950 --> 01:24:47.890 align:middle line:84%
We're like, wait, no, it's
definitely a blue eye.

01:24:47.890 --> 01:24:49.682 align:middle line:10%
But if you actually
went microscopic on it,

01:24:49.682 --> 01:24:52.280 align:middle line:10%
you'd see that all the
pigments in the eye are brown.

01:24:52.280 --> 01:24:55.160 align:middle line:10%
The only difference
between races of people

01:24:55.160 --> 01:25:00.012 align:middle line:10%
is between everybody in
the world and redheads.

01:25:00.012 --> 01:25:00.970 align:middle line:90%
Redheads are different.

01:25:00.970 --> 01:25:02.400 align:middle line:84%
They have a completely
different metabolism,

01:25:02.400 --> 01:25:03.720 align:middle line:90%
completely different melanin.

01:25:03.720 --> 01:25:08.350 align:middle line:10%
So everybody in the world,
Chinese, African, European,

01:25:08.350 --> 01:25:12.820 align:middle line:10%
North American, South
American, all the same except

01:25:12.820 --> 01:25:13.620 align:middle line:10%
for redheads.

01:25:13.620 --> 01:25:14.880 align:middle line:90%
Redheads are different.

01:25:14.880 --> 01:25:16.500 align:middle line:84%
They actually have
pheomelanin, which

01:25:16.500 --> 01:25:18.625 align:middle line:84%
is running their metabolism,
whereas everybody else

01:25:18.625 --> 01:25:20.010 align:middle line:90%
has melanin.

01:25:20.010 --> 01:25:22.950 align:middle line:84%
Pheomelanin is a
sulfur bearing melanin,

01:25:22.950 --> 01:25:26.640 align:middle line:84%
so redheads actually need
more sulfur in their diet.

01:25:26.640 --> 01:25:30.540 align:middle line:84%
That's a very big discovery,
and a very important discovery.

01:25:30.540 --> 01:25:32.400 align:middle line:84%
So the metabolism of
redheads is actually

01:25:32.400 --> 01:25:34.968 align:middle line:84%
completely different
than everybody else.

01:25:34.968 --> 01:25:37.260 align:middle line:84%
So if we're going to really
talk about races of people,

01:25:37.260 --> 01:25:39.330 align:middle line:84%
there are really
actually only two.

01:25:39.330 --> 01:25:42.690 align:middle line:84%
There is everybody, and
then there's redheads.

01:25:42.690 --> 01:25:43.610 align:middle line:90%
That a trip?

01:25:43.610 --> 01:25:45.450 align:middle line:90%
>> Where did the [AUDIO OUT]

01:25:45.450 --> 01:25:46.680 align:middle line:90%
>> Great question.

01:25:46.680 --> 01:25:48.370 align:middle line:90%
Where does anybody come from?

01:25:48.370 --> 01:25:49.630 align:middle line:90%
Where do we come from?

01:25:49.630 --> 01:25:51.172 align:middle line:84%
Oh, I'll tell you
where we came from.

01:25:51.172 --> 01:25:53.160 align:middle line:90%
The Big Bang.

01:25:53.160 --> 01:25:55.500 align:middle line:84%
Billions and billions
of years ago.

01:25:55.500 --> 01:26:00.660 align:middle line:84%
It's just a nonstop
barrage of nonsense.

01:26:00.660 --> 01:26:01.670 align:middle line:90%
No, it's theories.

01:26:01.670 --> 01:26:02.470 align:middle line:90%
It's theories.

01:26:02.470 --> 01:26:03.670 align:middle line:90%
OK, cool, whatever.

01:26:03.670 --> 01:26:05.160 align:middle line:90%
But it's not a fact.

01:26:05.160 --> 01:26:07.020 align:middle line:90%
It's just a theory.

01:26:07.020 --> 01:26:08.800 align:middle line:84%
People get so hung
up on their theories.

01:26:08.800 --> 01:26:10.980 align:middle line:84%
They're like, no, no, this
theory has to be true,

01:26:10.980 --> 01:26:14.690 align:middle line:90%
because this my creation story.

01:26:14.690 --> 01:26:18.090 align:middle line:84%
Our creation story
has to be true.

01:26:18.090 --> 01:26:19.083 align:middle line:90%
Says who, dude?

01:26:19.083 --> 01:26:20.500 align:middle line:84%
You might as well
believe in Zeus.

01:26:20.500 --> 01:26:21.330 align:middle line:90%
Like who are you?

01:26:21.330 --> 01:26:23.497 align:middle line:84%
What do you mean your
creation story has to be true?

01:26:23.497 --> 01:26:25.710 align:middle line:90%
What kind of arrogance is that?

01:26:25.710 --> 01:26:29.100 align:middle line:84%
Your creation story is
just another creation story

01:26:29.100 --> 01:26:31.890 align:middle line:84%
that some human being
dreamed up and now everybody

01:26:31.890 --> 01:26:33.960 align:middle line:84%
believes in it because
that's the current Zeus

01:26:33.960 --> 01:26:35.280 align:middle line:90%
mythology of today.

01:26:35.280 --> 01:26:38.690 align:middle line:84%
Tomorrow it'll be
something else.

01:26:38.690 --> 01:26:41.810 align:middle line:84%
Does this make-- I mean, you
cannot believe what it takes

01:26:41.810 --> 01:26:44.350 align:middle line:84%
to get people to open up to
this, because they're like,

01:26:44.350 --> 01:26:48.380 align:middle line:84%
my creation story has
to be true or else,

01:26:48.380 --> 01:26:51.640 align:middle line:84%
or else I might have
to think differently.

01:26:51.640 --> 01:26:52.880 align:middle line:90%
I can't do that.

01:26:52.880 --> 01:26:55.783 align:middle line:90%


01:26:55.783 --> 01:26:56.700 align:middle line:90%
Am I entertaining you?

01:26:56.700 --> 01:27:02.120 align:middle line:90%


01:27:02.120 --> 01:27:03.400 align:middle line:90%
Blue is almost always fake.

01:27:03.400 --> 01:27:04.570 align:middle line:90%
Now, there are real blues.

01:27:04.570 --> 01:27:06.800 align:middle line:10%
One of the real
blues is phycocyanin

01:27:06.800 --> 01:27:09.730 align:middle line:10%
or phycophycocyanin, which
is a pigment I really, really

01:27:09.730 --> 01:27:11.740 align:middle line:10%
strongly recommend
that you get into,

01:27:11.740 --> 01:27:14.830 align:middle line:10%
which is the blue pigments of
algae, what's in spirulina,

01:27:14.830 --> 01:27:16.692 align:middle line:10%
what's in blue-green algae.

01:27:16.692 --> 01:27:18.400 align:middle line:84%
And what's going on
with the blue pigment

01:27:18.400 --> 01:27:20.980 align:middle line:90%
is it's like a master--

01:27:20.980 --> 01:27:22.390 align:middle line:90%
it's a master molecule.

01:27:22.390 --> 01:27:25.360 align:middle line:90%
It's like bilirubin.

01:27:25.360 --> 01:27:27.610 align:middle line:10%
Bilirubin is a yellow
pigment that your body

01:27:27.610 --> 01:27:31.660 align:middle line:10%
creates as a master
regulator of all systems.

01:27:31.660 --> 01:27:38.590 align:middle line:84%
Your joints, your kidneys, your
liver, your heart, your spleen,

01:27:38.590 --> 01:27:41.110 align:middle line:84%
your digestive
organs, your brain.

01:27:41.110 --> 01:27:43.330 align:middle line:84%
All of them are
monitored by bilirubin.

01:27:43.330 --> 01:27:46.438 align:middle line:84%
And the bilirubin keeps
everything in homeostasis.

01:27:46.438 --> 01:27:48.730 align:middle line:84%
There's only one pigment in
the world that can actually

01:27:48.730 --> 01:27:49.630 align:middle line:90%
displace bilirubin.

01:27:49.630 --> 01:27:55.730 align:middle line:84%
It's called phycocyanin, or
I call it phycophycocyanin.

01:27:55.730 --> 01:27:57.080 align:middle line:90%
Did I say that too fast?

01:27:57.080 --> 01:28:05.270 align:middle line:84%
Phycophycocyanin is
P-H-Y-C-O-P-H-Y-C-O-C-Y-A-N-I-N.

01:28:05.270 --> 01:28:11.690 align:middle line:84%
Phycocyanin,
P-H-Y-C-O-C-Y-A-N-I-N.

01:28:11.690 --> 01:28:13.220 align:middle line:84%
And what's going
on with phycocyanin

01:28:13.220 --> 01:28:16.140 align:middle line:90%
is it's like a master substance.

01:28:16.140 --> 01:28:19.420 align:middle line:84%
So for example, somebody
has joint problems.

01:28:19.420 --> 01:28:22.130 align:middle line:90%
They have bone marrow issues.

01:28:22.130 --> 01:28:24.110 align:middle line:90%
Somebody has a heart issue.

01:28:24.110 --> 01:28:28.270 align:middle line:84%
Phycocyanin, phycocyanin
for everything.

01:28:28.270 --> 01:28:30.770 align:middle line:10%
It is one of the best
anti-inflammatories going.

01:28:30.770 --> 01:28:31.728 align:middle line:90%
It is one of the most--

01:28:31.728 --> 01:28:33.020 align:middle line:90%
I've got to show you, actually.

01:28:33.020 --> 01:28:34.870 align:middle line:84%
Do you guys want to
see what it looks like?

01:28:34.870 --> 01:28:39.745 align:middle line:84%
It's one of the most unusual
looking molecules ever.

01:28:39.745 --> 01:28:41.120 align:middle line:84%
And let me see if
I can get this.

01:28:41.120 --> 01:28:42.570 align:middle line:90%
It's so symmetrical.

01:28:42.570 --> 01:28:45.960 align:middle line:84%
This is why-- let's
see if I got this.

01:28:45.960 --> 01:28:47.720 align:middle line:90%
Oh yeah.

01:28:47.720 --> 01:28:50.000 align:middle line:90%
Bam, there it is.

01:28:50.000 --> 01:28:52.790 align:middle line:10%
This is why nature
always skips blue.

01:28:52.790 --> 01:28:56.760 align:middle line:10%
It's too symmetrical, requires
too much energy in order.

01:28:56.760 --> 01:28:59.810 align:middle line:10%
And so it's a very
highly energetic molecule

01:28:59.810 --> 01:29:03.452 align:middle line:10%
for that reason, and therefore
it's one of the most potent

01:29:03.452 --> 01:29:04.660 align:middle line:10%
and one of the most powerful.

01:29:04.660 --> 01:29:07.340 align:middle line:10%
So whenever I'm at a show, I'm
always looking for, like, hey,

01:29:07.340 --> 01:29:11.170 align:middle line:10%
do you guys got the spirulina
blue-green algae extract?

01:29:11.170 --> 01:29:14.140 align:middle line:10%
The one with the
phycophycocyanin in it?

01:29:14.140 --> 01:29:17.410 align:middle line:90%
Phycocyanin.

01:29:17.410 --> 01:29:18.940 align:middle line:84%
And you'll find
them at every show.

01:29:18.940 --> 01:29:20.500 align:middle line:84%
There's going to
be some blue drink,

01:29:20.500 --> 01:29:22.310 align:middle line:84%
and that's the
one that you want.

01:29:22.310 --> 01:29:27.010 align:middle line:84%
Now, this is known, by the way,
to be a stem cell stimulator.

01:29:27.010 --> 01:29:29.440 align:middle line:10%
And so when you put this
with the medicinal mushrooms

01:29:29.440 --> 01:29:33.813 align:middle line:10%
together, very good combination,
because the medicinal mushrooms

01:29:33.813 --> 01:29:35.980 align:middle line:10%
will take all those new
cells, all those white blood

01:29:35.980 --> 01:29:39.080 align:middle line:10%
cells, and start
weaponizing them.

01:29:39.080 --> 01:29:41.780 align:middle line:84%
What do medicinal
mushrooms like chaga do?

01:29:41.780 --> 01:29:44.410 align:middle line:84%
Let's go back to chaga,
chaga being right here.

01:29:44.410 --> 01:29:46.920 align:middle line:90%


01:29:46.920 --> 01:29:48.650 align:middle line:90%
What does this do?

01:29:48.650 --> 01:29:53.730 align:middle line:84%
This, and this,
and this, and this.

01:29:53.730 --> 01:29:54.530 align:middle line:90%
Oh, not that.

01:29:54.530 --> 01:29:57.570 align:middle line:90%


01:29:57.570 --> 01:29:59.370 align:middle line:90%
Oh, this is great.

01:29:59.370 --> 01:30:02.040 align:middle line:90%
That's Def Leppard.

01:30:02.040 --> 01:30:04.400 align:middle line:84%
They have a David
Wolfe in Def Leppard.

01:30:04.400 --> 01:30:05.480 align:middle line:90%
He's their sound guy.

01:30:05.480 --> 01:30:07.310 align:middle line:90%
Here's Lion's Mane.

01:30:07.310 --> 01:30:11.540 align:middle line:84%
It's amazing over the years,
these people that you meet.

01:30:11.540 --> 01:30:12.800 align:middle line:90%
You never know.

01:30:12.800 --> 01:30:14.510 align:middle line:90%
You never know.

01:30:14.510 --> 01:30:19.340 align:middle line:84%
The two guitarists for
Def Leppard, one of them,

01:30:19.340 --> 01:30:21.913 align:middle line:90%
Vivian Campbell, cancer.

01:30:21.913 --> 01:30:24.080 align:middle line:84%
Back in the days when I had
all my stuff on YouTube,

01:30:24.080 --> 01:30:26.122 align:middle line:84%
him and his wife studied
all my stuff on YouTube.

01:30:26.122 --> 01:30:26.940 align:middle line:90%
It saved his life.

01:30:26.940 --> 01:30:27.980 align:middle line:90%
I had no idea.

01:30:27.980 --> 01:30:29.688 align:middle line:84%
When I went and met
them, they were like,

01:30:29.688 --> 01:30:31.363 align:middle line:90%
his wife was crying all over me.

01:30:31.363 --> 01:30:32.780 align:middle line:84%
I was like, whoa,
what's going on?

01:30:32.780 --> 01:30:35.953 align:middle line:90%
He said, [MUTTERING] Oh, my god.

01:30:35.953 --> 01:30:37.370 align:middle line:84%
I was like, whoa,
Vivian Campbell.

01:30:37.370 --> 01:30:39.980 align:middle line:90%
Like Dio, I'm a heavy metal guy.

01:30:39.980 --> 01:30:41.840 align:middle line:84%
I come from that
world, so I grew up

01:30:41.840 --> 01:30:45.200 align:middle line:84%
with like Ronnie James
Dio, Def Leppard,

01:30:45.200 --> 01:30:46.870 align:middle line:84%
you know, that was
my world in the '80s.

01:30:46.870 --> 01:30:50.900 align:middle line:84%
And last in line, the guy who
wrote that great crazy solo,

01:30:50.900 --> 01:30:54.470 align:middle line:84%
Vivian Campbell, later
as my life evolved,

01:30:54.470 --> 01:30:56.480 align:middle line:90%
ended up saving that guy's life.

01:30:56.480 --> 01:30:57.380 align:middle line:90%
What a trip.

01:30:57.380 --> 01:30:58.600 align:middle line:84%
This guy right
here, Phil Collen,

01:30:58.600 --> 01:31:00.142 align:middle line:84%
the guy that was
just in the picture.

01:31:00.142 --> 01:31:01.310 align:middle line:90%
I'll go back and show him.

01:31:01.310 --> 01:31:03.082 align:middle line:84%
He's been a vegan
for over 30 years.

01:31:03.082 --> 01:31:04.790 align:middle line:84%
He's one of the main
guys in Def Leppard.

01:31:04.790 --> 01:31:07.970 align:middle line:84%
He's been in Def Leppard
for like 36 years.

01:31:07.970 --> 01:31:11.810 align:middle line:84%
What an amazing story where he
came from, his whole history.

01:31:11.810 --> 01:31:13.728 align:middle line:90%
Everything is just incredible.

01:31:13.728 --> 01:31:15.770 align:middle line:84%
So you just never know
who you're going to touch,

01:31:15.770 --> 01:31:17.790 align:middle line:84%
or who's going to be reached
out there in the world.

01:31:17.790 --> 01:31:18.730 align:middle line:90%
That's why I keep going.

01:31:18.730 --> 01:31:19.530 align:middle line:90%
I'll keep going.

01:31:19.530 --> 01:31:21.430 align:middle line:84%
You know, one day it
was Novak called me.

01:31:21.430 --> 01:31:23.600 align:middle line:90%
And who's going to call me next?

01:31:23.600 --> 01:31:25.190 align:middle line:90%
Who's going to call next?

01:31:25.190 --> 01:31:27.570 align:middle line:84%
Hopefully one of
these politicians.

01:31:27.570 --> 01:31:31.070 align:middle line:84%
And I'll be like, we're going
to stick a hose up your ass,

01:31:31.070 --> 01:31:35.320 align:middle line:84%
and we're going to flush
out those parasites.

01:31:35.320 --> 01:31:36.380 align:middle line:90%
Did I say that?

01:31:36.380 --> 01:31:37.180 align:middle line:90%
Oops.

01:31:37.180 --> 01:31:43.590 align:middle line:90%


01:31:43.590 --> 01:31:45.720 align:middle line:84%
People, it's just
amazing the resistance

01:31:45.720 --> 01:31:48.990 align:middle line:84%
to like, an enema or colonic,
just that right that there.

01:31:48.990 --> 01:31:51.170 align:middle line:84%
The resistance is
just outrageous.

01:31:51.170 --> 01:31:52.170 align:middle line:90%
People are like, no, no.

01:31:52.170 --> 01:31:53.295 align:middle line:90%
I'm eliminating everything.

01:31:53.295 --> 01:31:54.630 align:middle line:90%
Everything's working fine.

01:31:54.630 --> 01:31:57.160 align:middle line:84%
It's like, you know Elvis was
eliminating everything too,

01:31:57.160 --> 01:31:57.960 align:middle line:90%
right?

01:31:57.960 --> 01:32:00.330 align:middle line:84%
And then they found out
he had like 14 pounds

01:32:00.330 --> 01:32:04.320 align:middle line:84%
of undigested
feces, and his body

01:32:04.320 --> 01:32:07.140 align:middle line:84%
was clogged up in his
colon, and a colonic

01:32:07.140 --> 01:32:09.180 align:middle line:90%
would have saved him, right?

01:32:09.180 --> 01:32:13.840 align:middle line:84%
I mean, he was detoxifying
every day too, right?

01:32:13.840 --> 01:32:16.962 align:middle line:90%
We call them detox deniers.

01:32:16.962 --> 01:32:19.170 align:middle line:84%
Like, oh, no, no, but the
body detoxes everything

01:32:19.170 --> 01:32:19.970 align:middle line:90%
automatically.

01:32:19.970 --> 01:32:20.770 align:middle line:90%
It's automatic.

01:32:20.770 --> 01:32:22.700 align:middle line:84%
And every day if you're
pooping it's all fine.

01:32:22.700 --> 01:32:24.140 align:middle line:90%
Everything's all coming out.

01:32:24.140 --> 01:32:27.170 align:middle line:84%
And as soon as you start
doing colonics, especially

01:32:27.170 --> 01:32:29.930 align:middle line:84%
after long fasts,
as you know, you

01:32:29.930 --> 01:32:31.610 align:middle line:84%
can't believe what's
coming out of you.

01:32:31.610 --> 01:32:33.020 align:middle line:84%
You're just like, more
stuff's coming out.

01:32:33.020 --> 01:32:33.980 align:middle line:90%
Where's this stuff coming from?

01:32:33.980 --> 01:32:34.840 align:middle line:90%
How could this stuff--

01:32:34.840 --> 01:32:35.640 align:middle line:90%
where's it going?

01:32:35.640 --> 01:32:37.346 align:middle line:90%
Like, what's going on here?

01:32:37.346 --> 01:32:39.780 align:middle line:84%
Has anybody been
through any of this?

01:32:39.780 --> 01:32:43.860 align:middle line:84%
Does anybody want to
go through any of this?

01:32:43.860 --> 01:32:46.890 align:middle line:84%
It is amazing to
me how much stuff

01:32:46.890 --> 01:32:52.140 align:middle line:84%
can come out of you even when
you haven't eaten in weeks.

01:32:52.140 --> 01:32:54.890 align:middle line:90%
It's amazing.

01:32:54.890 --> 01:32:57.770 align:middle line:84%
And then you go,
oh, I get it now.

01:32:57.770 --> 01:33:00.354 align:middle line:90%
We're all full of.

01:33:00.354 --> 01:33:04.210 align:middle line:90%


01:33:04.210 --> 01:33:06.740 align:middle line:84%
And then you get the people
who say, well, I eat clean,

01:33:06.740 --> 01:33:08.000 align:middle line:90%
so I don't need to detox.

01:33:08.000 --> 01:33:09.458 align:middle line:84%
And it's like, who
are you kidding?

01:33:09.458 --> 01:33:10.833 align:middle line:84%
That's like saying
that you never

01:33:10.833 --> 01:33:12.560 align:middle line:84%
need to clean your
house all the way

01:33:12.560 --> 01:33:15.130 align:middle line:84%
and get it all down
to the brass tacks.

01:33:15.130 --> 01:33:16.630 align:middle line:84%
At some time in the
year, you've got

01:33:16.630 --> 01:33:19.070 align:middle line:84%
to get down to the brass
tacks and go deep, deep, deep.

01:33:19.070 --> 01:33:20.450 align:middle line:90%
Otherwise you won't.

01:33:20.450 --> 01:33:22.148 align:middle line:90%
I know how the human nature is.

01:33:22.148 --> 01:33:23.690 align:middle line:84%
It's like, at some
point you're going

01:33:23.690 --> 01:33:25.180 align:middle line:90%
to be like, oh, that's OK.

01:33:25.180 --> 01:33:26.180 align:middle line:90%
I don't need to do that.

01:33:26.180 --> 01:33:26.980 align:middle line:90%
I'm fine.

01:33:26.980 --> 01:33:30.150 align:middle line:90%


01:33:30.150 --> 01:33:31.795 align:middle line:84%
I don't need to
do that right now.

01:33:31.795 --> 01:33:33.670 align:middle line:84%
But when you're cleansing
and you're fasting,

01:33:33.670 --> 01:33:36.660 align:middle line:84%
and you're in with a
group, then the group

01:33:36.660 --> 01:33:37.770 align:middle line:90%
holds you accountable.

01:33:37.770 --> 01:33:40.920 align:middle line:84%
March 13, we're
kicking off our detox.

01:33:40.920 --> 01:33:42.780 align:middle line:84%
I recommend that you
join, because we'll

01:33:42.780 --> 01:33:43.800 align:middle line:90%
keep you accountable.

01:33:43.800 --> 01:33:46.098 align:middle line:84%
Because there will be 100
people just in my group,

01:33:46.098 --> 01:33:47.640 align:middle line:84%
let alone the hundreds
of people that

01:33:47.640 --> 01:33:50.330 align:middle line:84%
come in from the outside
that'll be like, what?

01:33:50.330 --> 01:33:51.130 align:middle line:90%
What are you doing?

01:33:51.130 --> 01:33:51.930 align:middle line:90%
What's happening?

01:33:51.930 --> 01:33:52.830 align:middle line:90%
What?

01:33:52.830 --> 01:33:53.940 align:middle line:84%
You didn't-- you
missed your day?

01:33:53.940 --> 01:33:54.090 align:middle line:90%
What?

01:33:54.090 --> 01:33:55.320 align:middle line:90%
You didn't do your coffee enema?

01:33:55.320 --> 01:33:56.820 align:middle line:84%
And you'll be like, oh god,
I've got to do a coffee enema.

01:33:56.820 --> 01:33:58.770 align:middle line:84%
OK, I've got to figure
out how to do this.

01:33:58.770 --> 01:34:00.690 align:middle line:84%
And then we'll walk
you through the steps.

01:34:00.690 --> 01:34:04.320 align:middle line:84%
Get your enema bag,
brew your coffee,

01:34:04.320 --> 01:34:07.410 align:middle line:84%
make sure you have
a coat hanger,

01:34:07.410 --> 01:34:11.410 align:middle line:84%
hang it up in your
bathroom, lay on the floor.

01:34:11.410 --> 01:34:12.498 align:middle line:90%
Fill-- right?

01:34:12.498 --> 01:34:14.040 align:middle line:84%
We'll walk you
through all the steps.

01:34:14.040 --> 01:34:15.870 align:middle line:84%
We've had people
going through that

01:34:15.870 --> 01:34:19.570 align:middle line:90%
while they're texting the group.

01:34:19.570 --> 01:34:20.620 align:middle line:90%
It's the best ever.

01:34:20.620 --> 01:34:21.587 align:middle line:90%
It really is.

01:34:21.587 --> 01:34:22.420 align:middle line:90%
I love those people.

01:34:22.420 --> 01:34:24.610 align:middle line:84%
It's like, they need to be
walked through every step?

01:34:24.610 --> 01:34:25.420 align:middle line:90%
No problem.

01:34:25.420 --> 01:34:27.830 align:middle line:84%
That's why we've
got text messages.

01:34:27.830 --> 01:34:29.870 align:middle line:84%
And they're on the floor,
and they're like, OK,

01:34:29.870 --> 01:34:30.670 align:middle line:90%
what do I do next?

01:34:30.670 --> 01:34:33.840 align:middle line:84%
And it's like, now
it's time to insert.

01:34:33.840 --> 01:34:36.390 align:middle line:90%
Do you have coconut oil?

01:34:36.390 --> 01:34:40.800 align:middle line:90%
>> [INAUDIBLE]

01:34:40.800 --> 01:34:43.060 align:middle line:90%
>> 15 minutes is always best.

01:34:43.060 --> 01:34:45.358 align:middle line:84%
But first-timers, especially
for those new people,

01:34:45.358 --> 01:34:46.900 align:middle line:84%
it's like, if you
could just-- if you

01:34:46.900 --> 01:34:51.550 align:middle line:84%
can get the five minutes--
you got to five minutes.

01:34:51.550 --> 01:34:54.534 align:middle line:84%
People usually don't make it to
five minutes that first time.

01:34:54.534 --> 01:34:55.470 align:middle line:90%
>> [INAUDIBLE]

01:34:55.470 --> 01:34:56.270 align:middle line:90%
>> And yeah.

01:34:56.270 --> 01:34:58.800 align:middle line:84%
Well, you mean for the
enemas, or the colonics?

01:34:58.800 --> 01:34:59.880 align:middle line:90%
>> For the enemas.

01:34:59.880 --> 01:35:01.500 align:middle line:84%
>> For the enemas, you
want a long enough tube,

01:35:01.500 --> 01:35:03.180 align:middle line:84%
and you want the
controller close to you.

01:35:03.180 --> 01:35:05.160 align:middle line:84%
That's another one, too,
because people suddenly

01:35:05.160 --> 01:35:05.790 align:middle line:90%
get there on the floor.

01:35:05.790 --> 01:35:07.710 align:middle line:84%
And then they've inserted,
and then all of a sudden

01:35:07.710 --> 01:35:09.335 align:middle line:84%
it's like, wait, the
control thing that

01:35:09.335 --> 01:35:13.080 align:middle line:84%
controls the flow of water
in, or the flow of whatever's

01:35:13.080 --> 01:35:16.860 align:middle line:84%
in there, in this case
coffee, is up there.

01:35:16.860 --> 01:35:18.270 align:middle line:90%
Then they have to go, oh no.

01:35:18.270 --> 01:35:21.540 align:middle line:84%
So we try to coach them all the
way through that whole process

01:35:21.540 --> 01:35:23.850 align:middle line:90%
so the thing is already close.

01:35:23.850 --> 01:35:26.150 align:middle line:84%
It's a lot of fun,
I have to say.

01:35:26.150 --> 01:35:28.608 align:middle line:84%
OK, so this is lion's mane,
which is getting a lot of press

01:35:28.608 --> 01:35:29.408 align:middle line:90%
these days.

01:35:29.408 --> 01:35:30.270 align:middle line:90%
There's lion's mane.

01:35:30.270 --> 01:35:31.687 align:middle line:84%
You may have heard
of lion's mane.

01:35:31.687 --> 01:35:33.900 align:middle line:10%
What's lion's mane about?

01:35:33.900 --> 01:35:36.390 align:middle line:10%
Nerve growth factors
for the brain.

01:35:36.390 --> 01:35:40.230 align:middle line:84%
Remember they told us
cannabis killed brain cells?

01:35:40.230 --> 01:35:41.940 align:middle line:90%
What do we find out later?

01:35:41.940 --> 01:35:44.560 align:middle line:90%
It repaired brain cells.

01:35:44.560 --> 01:35:46.110 align:middle line:84%
So people started
getting into, hey,

01:35:46.110 --> 01:35:48.510 align:middle line:84%
how do we repair
brain cells from all

01:35:48.510 --> 01:35:54.070 align:middle line:84%
of the pharmaceuticals, the
alcohol, the glyphosate, food,

01:35:54.070 --> 01:35:54.912 align:middle line:90%
et cetera?

01:35:54.912 --> 01:35:57.370 align:middle line:84%
And one of the big discoveries
is the lion's mane mushroom,

01:35:57.370 --> 01:35:59.760 align:middle line:84%
which is in the top 20
medicinal mushrooms.

01:35:59.760 --> 01:36:01.100 align:middle line:90%
And it's really good.

01:36:01.100 --> 01:36:02.170 align:middle line:90%
Oh, whoops.

01:36:02.170 --> 01:36:03.660 align:middle line:90%
Let me go here.

01:36:03.660 --> 01:36:06.210 align:middle line:10%
Here's another one of the great
mushrooms right here, morels.

01:36:06.210 --> 01:36:07.830 align:middle line:10%
You see those
morels right there?

01:36:07.830 --> 01:36:10.390 align:middle line:10%


01:36:10.390 --> 01:36:13.440 align:middle line:10%
That's another super brain
food, nerve growth factors.

01:36:13.440 --> 01:36:14.940 align:middle line:10%
One of the greatest
foods out there.

01:36:14.940 --> 01:36:16.740 align:middle line:10%
I love morels.

01:36:16.740 --> 01:36:19.650 align:middle line:10%
Mushrooms have been with us
since the beginning of time,

01:36:19.650 --> 01:36:22.710 align:middle line:10%
and they're one of the key
food groups for a human being.

01:36:22.710 --> 01:36:26.630 align:middle line:84%
Let's get into this a little bit
right here, some of these guys.

01:36:26.630 --> 01:36:29.420 align:middle line:90%
Oh, that's another story.

01:36:29.420 --> 01:36:30.220 align:middle line:90%
Let's go here.

01:36:30.220 --> 01:36:31.760 align:middle line:90%
OK.

01:36:31.760 --> 01:36:33.660 align:middle line:84%
Oh, no, I don't need
to search anything.

01:36:33.660 --> 01:36:35.270 align:middle line:90%
I want to go here like that.

01:36:35.270 --> 01:36:36.070 align:middle line:10%
Bam.

01:36:36.070 --> 01:36:37.570 align:middle line:10%
That's a baby reishi.

01:36:37.570 --> 01:36:40.896 align:middle line:90%
Look how cute that thing is.

01:36:40.896 --> 01:36:43.310 align:middle line:90%
Isn't that the cutest ever?

01:36:43.310 --> 01:36:44.550 align:middle line:90%
And when they're that stage--

01:36:44.550 --> 01:36:45.320 align:middle line:90%
this is a reishi mushroom.

01:36:45.320 --> 01:36:46.800 align:middle line:84%
This is the most prized
mushroom in the world.

01:36:46.800 --> 01:36:47.900 align:middle line:90%
This is the queen.

01:36:47.900 --> 01:36:49.940 align:middle line:84%
Like on the chessboard,
there's a queen.

01:36:49.940 --> 01:36:52.470 align:middle line:90%
The queen has all the moves.

01:36:52.470 --> 01:36:54.370 align:middle line:84%
The queen has all
the moves, right?

01:36:54.370 --> 01:36:56.740 align:middle line:90%
That's reishi mushroom, exact.

01:36:56.740 --> 01:36:57.550 align:middle line:90%
Boom.

01:36:57.550 --> 01:36:58.870 align:middle line:90%
Reishi has all the moves.

01:36:58.870 --> 01:37:00.370 align:middle line:84%
You've got a problem,
I would really

01:37:00.370 --> 01:37:02.750 align:middle line:84%
recommend go to
reishi mushroom first.

01:37:02.750 --> 01:37:03.550 align:middle line:90%
Why?

01:37:03.550 --> 01:37:05.008 align:middle line:84%
Because it has the
longest history.

01:37:05.008 --> 01:37:08.938 align:middle line:84%
It's most well-studied herb
in the history of the world.

01:37:08.938 --> 01:37:10.230 align:middle line:90%
Just imagine that for a second.

01:37:10.230 --> 01:37:10.820 align:middle line:90%
Let's just take that on.

01:37:10.820 --> 01:37:11.370 align:middle line:90%
We're going to take that on.

01:37:11.370 --> 01:37:12.270 align:middle line:84%
Let's just-- we're
going to sit down.

01:37:12.270 --> 01:37:14.812 align:middle line:84%
We're going to go, OK, let me
just take this on for a second.

01:37:14.812 --> 01:37:15.950 align:middle line:90%
Let's sit down here.

01:37:15.950 --> 01:37:16.950 align:middle line:90%
I'm just going to think.

01:37:16.950 --> 01:37:19.520 align:middle line:90%


01:37:19.520 --> 01:37:21.440 align:middle line:84%
This herb right here
has been studied

01:37:21.440 --> 01:37:27.040 align:middle line:84%
more than any other herb in
the history of the world.

01:37:27.040 --> 01:37:29.050 align:middle line:90%
Do you think it does nothing?

01:37:29.050 --> 01:37:31.420 align:middle line:90%
Who thinks it does nothing?

01:37:31.420 --> 01:37:33.040 align:middle line:84%
Your doctor thinks
it does nothing.

01:37:33.040 --> 01:37:37.310 align:middle line:90%


01:37:37.310 --> 01:37:40.070 align:middle line:84%
Just think of how crazy
that is right there.

01:37:40.070 --> 01:37:42.620 align:middle line:84%
Every five years, the
Chinese Academy of Sciences

01:37:42.620 --> 01:37:45.787 align:middle line:84%
publishes a tome that thick on
all the Chinese herbs and all

01:37:45.787 --> 01:37:47.870 align:middle line:84%
the research that's been
done on the Chinese herbs

01:37:47.870 --> 01:37:50.930 align:middle line:90%
over those five years.

01:37:50.930 --> 01:37:54.860 align:middle line:84%
Reishi mushroom, there's
1,000 studies minimum

01:37:54.860 --> 01:37:58.010 align:middle line:84%
going on right now on reishi
mushroom alone, just right now,

01:37:58.010 --> 01:38:00.080 align:middle line:90%
just today.

01:38:00.080 --> 01:38:02.980 align:middle line:90%
Do you think it does nothing?

01:38:02.980 --> 01:38:03.940 align:middle line:90%
Is it possible?

01:38:03.940 --> 01:38:05.830 align:middle line:84%
Is there even a
remote possibility

01:38:05.830 --> 01:38:08.790 align:middle line:90%
it could do nothing?

01:38:08.790 --> 01:38:11.940 align:middle line:84%
There's not even a remote
possibility it does nothing.

01:38:11.940 --> 01:38:13.670 align:middle line:84%
So right there, that
tells you something.

01:38:13.670 --> 01:38:14.640 align:middle line:90%
It's like, hey, whoa.

01:38:14.640 --> 01:38:17.160 align:middle line:90%
It does something.

01:38:17.160 --> 01:38:18.840 align:middle line:90%
What is that something?

01:38:18.840 --> 01:38:22.558 align:middle line:84%
It's impossible to know
unless you actually take it.

01:38:22.558 --> 01:38:24.350 align:middle line:84%
And that's the whole
thing about herbalism.

01:38:24.350 --> 01:38:26.667 align:middle line:90%
It's called compliance.

01:38:26.667 --> 01:38:28.750 align:middle line:84%
It's impossible to know
what anything does for you

01:38:28.750 --> 01:38:30.010 align:middle line:90%
unless you actually take it.

01:38:30.010 --> 01:38:32.540 align:middle line:84%
Nobody knows anything
about anything

01:38:32.540 --> 01:38:34.690 align:middle line:90%
unless they've actually done it.

01:38:34.690 --> 01:38:37.160 align:middle line:84%
Your doctor saying, reishi
mushroom doesn't do anything,

01:38:37.160 --> 01:38:40.780 align:middle line:84%
we have no research, doesn't
know anything about it.

01:38:40.780 --> 01:38:42.370 align:middle line:90%
Nothing at all.

01:38:42.370 --> 01:38:45.730 align:middle line:84%
Never hunted it in the
wild, never eaten it, never

01:38:45.730 --> 01:38:50.180 align:middle line:84%
extracted it, never fed
it to people, never fed it

01:38:50.180 --> 01:38:50.980 align:middle line:90%
to children.

01:38:50.980 --> 01:38:54.970 align:middle line:84%
Has no idea what they're
talking about whatsoever.

01:38:54.970 --> 01:38:56.995 align:middle line:84%
Yet they will say
there's no research.

01:38:56.995 --> 01:38:59.710 align:middle line:90%


01:38:59.710 --> 01:39:05.290 align:middle line:84%
This is the contradictions that
we're running headlong into.

01:39:05.290 --> 01:39:09.310 align:middle line:84%
There's no chance on Earth that
that virus is going to get me.

01:39:09.310 --> 01:39:10.210 align:middle line:90%
No chance.

01:39:10.210 --> 01:39:12.400 align:middle line:84%
There's no chance any
virus is going to get me.

01:39:12.400 --> 01:39:14.340 align:middle line:90%
It's impossible.

01:39:14.340 --> 01:39:16.095 align:middle line:84%
You're like, oh no,
you can't say that.

01:39:16.095 --> 01:39:16.970 align:middle line:90%
How can you say that?

01:39:16.970 --> 01:39:19.190 align:middle line:84%
Because I'm not
bought into scientism.

01:39:19.190 --> 01:39:21.260 align:middle line:84%
I'm not bought
into that garbage.

01:39:21.260 --> 01:39:22.190 align:middle line:90%
There's no chance.

01:39:22.190 --> 01:39:25.010 align:middle line:84%
You listen to me, I will give
you exactly the tools you need.

01:39:25.010 --> 01:39:26.720 align:middle line:84%
You will never be
sick ever again.

01:39:26.720 --> 01:39:29.420 align:middle line:84%
You'll never have a cough,
a cold, a flu, a fever,

01:39:29.420 --> 01:39:30.830 align:middle line:90%
a sniffle, anything.

01:39:30.830 --> 01:39:34.147 align:middle line:84%
It will be over forever,
if you want that.

01:39:34.147 --> 01:39:34.980 align:middle line:90%
Some people want it.

01:39:34.980 --> 01:39:37.120 align:middle line:90%
Some people don't.

01:39:37.120 --> 01:39:38.170 align:middle line:90%
We'll get you sorted out.

01:39:38.170 --> 01:39:39.295 align:middle line:90%
We'll get you cleansed out.

01:39:39.295 --> 01:39:40.740 align:middle line:90%
We'll get the toxins out.

01:39:40.740 --> 01:39:42.130 align:middle line:90%
We'll get the carbon in.

01:39:42.130 --> 01:39:43.630 align:middle line:90%
We reset your system.

01:39:43.630 --> 01:39:45.520 align:middle line:90%
We get the weight off.

01:39:45.520 --> 01:39:48.100 align:middle line:84%
You get your system back
into proper functionality

01:39:48.100 --> 01:39:49.730 align:middle line:84%
so that you're
squished out, you're

01:39:49.730 --> 01:39:51.430 align:middle line:90%
sweating, everything's moving.

01:39:51.430 --> 01:39:54.010 align:middle line:84%
We get you on the medicinal
mushrooms in heavy dosages

01:39:54.010 --> 01:39:56.638 align:middle line:84%
so that you are actually
loaded for years.

01:39:56.638 --> 01:39:58.180 align:middle line:84%
I've been taking
medicinal mushrooms,

01:39:58.180 --> 01:40:01.810 align:middle line:84%
as you know, daily for 15
years unless I was fasting.

01:40:01.810 --> 01:40:03.980 align:middle line:84%
I'd way rather take medicinal
mushrooms than food.

01:40:03.980 --> 01:40:06.010 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it's not
even a comparison.

01:40:06.010 --> 01:40:10.320 align:middle line:90%
Food is toxic compared to herbs.

01:40:10.320 --> 01:40:12.140 align:middle line:90%
What?

01:40:12.140 --> 01:40:14.250 align:middle line:90%
What are you talking about?

01:40:14.250 --> 01:40:15.980 align:middle line:90%
Food is so toxic.

01:40:15.980 --> 01:40:19.500 align:middle line:84%
Do you know how many people
die every day of eating chicken

01:40:19.500 --> 01:40:21.330 align:middle line:90%
in this country?

01:40:21.330 --> 01:40:23.100 align:middle line:90%
You can't believe it.

01:40:23.100 --> 01:40:26.140 align:middle line:84%
Do you know how many people die
every day from eating steak?

01:40:26.140 --> 01:40:28.700 align:middle line:90%


01:40:28.700 --> 01:40:30.500 align:middle line:90%
But you had-- but herbs.

01:40:30.500 --> 01:40:32.240 align:middle line:90%
Oh, you can't have that.

01:40:32.240 --> 01:40:33.740 align:middle line:90%
Well, my doctor said.

01:40:33.740 --> 01:40:38.170 align:middle line:90%


01:40:38.170 --> 01:40:41.800 align:middle line:90%
The contradictions are insane.

01:40:41.800 --> 01:40:44.620 align:middle line:90%
So every day, tonic herbs.

01:40:44.620 --> 01:40:47.180 align:middle line:90%
Every day, medicinal mushrooms.

01:40:47.180 --> 01:40:47.980 align:middle line:90%
Food?

01:40:47.980 --> 01:40:49.980 align:middle line:90%
That's a way secondary thought.

01:40:49.980 --> 01:40:52.918 align:middle line:84%
Superfoods, OK, I'll do
a superfood smoothie.

01:40:52.918 --> 01:40:55.290 align:middle line:90%
That'd be good.

01:40:55.290 --> 01:40:59.790 align:middle line:84%
Then we start talking about the
iodine and the coated silver.

01:40:59.790 --> 01:41:01.170 align:middle line:90%
There is no chance--

01:41:01.170 --> 01:41:05.010 align:middle line:84%
I mean, we get you on the
carbon, the super herbs,

01:41:05.010 --> 01:41:08.340 align:middle line:84%
the superfoods, get
the colon cleansed out,

01:41:08.340 --> 01:41:12.990 align:middle line:84%
get the tissue squished, and
get the tissue quality back.

01:41:12.990 --> 01:41:14.560 align:middle line:84%
Get it pliable,
get things moving,

01:41:14.560 --> 01:41:16.742 align:middle line:90%
get the chicken gristle out.

01:41:16.742 --> 01:41:19.610 align:middle line:84%
I get into people's shoulders
and it's like, whoa, chicken

01:41:19.610 --> 01:41:20.410 align:middle line:90%
gristle.

01:41:20.410 --> 01:41:23.320 align:middle line:90%


01:41:23.320 --> 01:41:24.130 align:middle line:90%
It's like bricks.

01:41:24.130 --> 01:41:26.865 align:middle line:90%
You're like, whoa.

01:41:26.865 --> 01:41:29.352 align:middle line:84%
So you get that-- gradually
sponge that stuff out.

01:41:29.352 --> 01:41:30.810 align:middle line:84%
Eventually you get
to a point where

01:41:30.810 --> 01:41:34.140 align:middle line:84%
you realize that, whoa, my
immune system is working.

01:41:34.140 --> 01:41:35.100 align:middle line:90%
Whoa.

01:41:35.100 --> 01:41:37.680 align:middle line:84%
Then the iodine, then the
coated silver, and then,

01:41:37.680 --> 01:41:45.420 align:middle line:84%
of course, the
electronic medicine.

01:41:45.420 --> 01:41:46.480 align:middle line:90%
Isn't that great?

01:41:46.480 --> 01:41:47.280 align:middle line:90%
What is it?

01:41:47.280 --> 01:41:48.210 align:middle line:90%
What's he-- what?

01:41:48.210 --> 01:41:51.887 align:middle line:90%


01:41:51.887 --> 01:41:53.220 align:middle line:90%
Ry, is this the best thing ever?

01:41:53.220 --> 01:41:55.950 align:middle line:90%


01:41:55.950 --> 01:41:58.080 align:middle line:90%
It just, it never ends.

01:41:58.080 --> 01:41:59.230 align:middle line:90%
The electronic medicine.

01:41:59.230 --> 01:42:00.030 align:middle line:90%
Watch this.

01:42:00.030 --> 01:42:00.360 align:middle line:90%
Ready?

01:42:00.360 --> 01:42:01.160 align:middle line:90%
Here it comes.

01:42:01.160 --> 01:42:02.215 align:middle line:90%
Against the toothache.

01:42:02.215 --> 01:42:04.590 align:middle line:84%
Said a dentist, they're like,
I've got to go to a dentist

01:42:04.590 --> 01:42:06.980 align:middle line:84%
so they can destroy me and
can put more mercury in me.

01:42:06.980 --> 01:42:10.445 align:middle line:90%


01:42:10.445 --> 01:42:11.930 align:middle line:90%
Just like that.

01:42:11.930 --> 01:42:13.430 align:middle line:90%
Just put it right up.

01:42:13.430 --> 01:42:14.980 align:middle line:84%
You have a problem
with your tooth?

01:42:14.980 --> 01:42:17.440 align:middle line:90%
OK, how about this?

01:42:17.440 --> 01:42:18.260 align:middle line:90%
Just like that.

01:42:18.260 --> 01:42:20.548 align:middle line:84%
A little zapper,
frequency generator.

01:42:20.548 --> 01:42:23.090 align:middle line:84%
You've got a little thing, OK,
a little thing in your throat.

01:42:23.090 --> 01:42:24.757 align:middle line:84%
OK, we'll put a
little-- how about this?

01:42:24.757 --> 01:42:25.792 align:middle line:90%
Put that right there.

01:42:25.792 --> 01:42:27.000 align:middle line:90%
Your lymph nodes are swollen?

01:42:27.000 --> 01:42:27.860 align:middle line:90%
OK, no problem.

01:42:27.860 --> 01:42:29.318 align:middle line:84%
We'll just put this
right on there.

01:42:29.318 --> 01:42:31.480 align:middle line:84%
And watch what this little,
simple little device--

01:42:31.480 --> 01:42:37.940 align:middle line:84%
all this is is a 555 switcher,
on, off, 15 times per second.

01:42:37.940 --> 01:42:40.870 align:middle line:84%
So instead of going like--
this stuff is all sine wave.

01:42:40.870 --> 01:42:45.300 align:middle line:90%
It's going like [BUZZING]

01:42:45.300 --> 01:42:49.090 align:middle line:90%
You've heard it, right?

01:42:49.090 --> 01:42:51.300 align:middle line:84%
You've all heard--
you hear it, and it's

01:42:51.300 --> 01:42:58.060 align:middle line:84%
like, [QUIET BUZZ] That's
corrosive to healthy tissue.

01:42:58.060 --> 01:43:00.810 align:middle line:84%
But the pulsation,
boom, boom, boom, on,

01:43:00.810 --> 01:43:03.062 align:middle line:84%
off, on, off, on, off,
15 times per second,

01:43:03.062 --> 01:43:04.020 align:middle line:90%
this is healthy tissue.

01:43:04.020 --> 01:43:04.937 align:middle line:90%
It goes, yep, take it.

01:43:04.937 --> 01:43:06.090 align:middle line:90%
We're taking that one.

01:43:06.090 --> 01:43:08.370 align:middle line:84%
That's what the discovery
of a zapper and a frequency

01:43:08.370 --> 01:43:09.250 align:middle line:90%
generator really is.

01:43:09.250 --> 01:43:11.910 align:middle line:84%
This is what Rife's
discovery led us to.

01:43:11.910 --> 01:43:14.040 align:middle line:84%
Rife's discovery 100
years ago eventually

01:43:14.040 --> 01:43:17.640 align:middle line:84%
led us to the simple fight down
to this little simple device,

01:43:17.640 --> 01:43:20.460 align:middle line:84%
a little simple device that can
be made with a RadioShack 555

01:43:20.460 --> 01:43:22.290 align:middle line:90%
switcher.

01:43:22.290 --> 01:43:24.900 align:middle line:90%
So easy, so simple.

01:43:24.900 --> 01:43:25.750 align:middle line:90%
I injured my leg.

01:43:25.750 --> 01:43:26.550 align:middle line:90%
So-- what's that?

01:43:26.550 --> 01:43:27.580 align:middle line:90%
>> Do you sell it?

01:43:27.580 --> 01:43:29.940 align:middle line:84%
>> I used to make these,
and I will make them again.

01:43:29.940 --> 01:43:31.610 align:middle line:90%
My friend Don Croft who was--

01:43:31.610 --> 01:43:33.660 align:middle line:84%
he was the main guy,
he unfortunately

01:43:33.660 --> 01:43:35.440 align:middle line:90%
died in a paragliding accident.

01:43:35.440 --> 01:43:38.340 align:middle line:84%
His website, interestingly,
was a great website,

01:43:38.340 --> 01:43:40.800 align:middle line:84%
worldwithoutparasites.com,
because he understood

01:43:40.800 --> 01:43:42.820 align:middle line:90%
what parasites are all about.

01:43:42.820 --> 01:43:45.645 align:middle line:84%
Because if you have one of
these, a good spot to put it

01:43:45.645 --> 01:43:50.340 align:middle line:84%
is right there, right
under your belly button,

01:43:50.340 --> 01:43:52.920 align:middle line:84%
real close to where
the problems are.

01:43:52.920 --> 01:43:54.730 align:middle line:84%
And you'll start
going, oh wait, what?

01:43:54.730 --> 01:43:55.530 align:middle line:90%
Huh?

01:43:55.530 --> 01:43:57.723 align:middle line:90%
And I'll just leave it at that.

01:43:57.723 --> 01:43:59.990 align:middle line:90%
>> [INAUDIBLE]

01:43:59.990 --> 01:44:01.960 align:middle line:84%
>> Bryant Myers, old
friend of mine, great guy.

01:44:01.960 --> 01:44:03.910 align:middle line:90%
>> [INAUDIBLE]

01:44:03.910 --> 01:44:05.110 align:middle line:90%
>> No, it doesn't.

01:44:05.110 --> 01:44:06.370 align:middle line:90%
Because it's very good.

01:44:06.370 --> 01:44:09.340 align:middle line:84%
And I'm into PEMF, I'm into
pulsed electromagnetic field

01:44:09.340 --> 01:44:11.860 align:middle line:84%
technology, which is
what this is, really.

01:44:11.860 --> 01:44:13.120 align:middle line:90%
I love Bryant Myers.

01:44:13.120 --> 01:44:15.190 align:middle line:84%
I think he's doing a
wonderful job with his book.

01:44:15.190 --> 01:44:17.710 align:middle line:84%
And I have those mats,
and I use them regularly.

01:44:17.710 --> 01:44:22.330 align:middle line:84%
But an electrical zapper that's
actually touching your skin,

01:44:22.330 --> 01:44:24.820 align:middle line:84%
that's a very difficult
thing to beat.

01:44:24.820 --> 01:44:26.450 align:middle line:90%
It's very difficult to beat it.

01:44:26.450 --> 01:44:27.250 align:middle line:90%
Why?

01:44:27.250 --> 01:44:29.710 align:middle line:84%
Because it goes-- it's
right on the physical plane.

01:44:29.710 --> 01:44:31.210 align:middle line:84%
It's going right
after them in a way

01:44:31.210 --> 01:44:34.130 align:middle line:84%
that it actually pulls
them to the surface.

01:44:34.130 --> 01:44:35.830 align:middle line:90%
If you look at my-- watch this.

01:44:35.830 --> 01:44:37.840 align:middle line:84%
We'll see if maybe get
this on the camera too.

01:44:37.840 --> 01:44:41.060 align:middle line:84%
You can see that
one side is darker.

01:44:41.060 --> 01:44:41.860 align:middle line:90%
See that?

01:44:41.860 --> 01:44:42.160 align:middle line:90%
You see that?

01:44:42.160 --> 01:44:44.040 align:middle line:84%
One side, that
electrode's darker,

01:44:44.040 --> 01:44:47.050 align:middle line:84%
and that's the
negatively-charged electrode.

01:44:47.050 --> 01:44:48.610 align:middle line:84%
That negatively-charged
electrode,

01:44:48.610 --> 01:44:52.310 align:middle line:84%
in this case it's up here,
is the one that is pulling

01:44:52.310 --> 01:44:56.090 align:middle line:84%
to itself all the toxins out
of like, I have an injury here,

01:44:56.090 --> 01:44:56.890 align:middle line:90%
so I had to--

01:44:56.890 --> 01:44:58.450 align:middle line:84%
I'm wearing this all
the time on that injury,

01:44:58.450 --> 01:45:00.658 align:middle line:84%
because it will get more
blood flow into that injury.

01:45:00.658 --> 01:45:06.500 align:middle line:84%
It will keep parasites
from getting in there,

01:45:06.500 --> 01:45:09.315 align:middle line:84%
because when you have a joint
injury, and then you're like,

01:45:09.315 --> 01:45:11.440 align:middle line:84%
oh, parasites don't exist,
eventually parasites go,

01:45:11.440 --> 01:45:13.480 align:middle line:84%
hey, this tissue is
necrotic, it's disturbed,

01:45:13.480 --> 01:45:14.990 align:middle line:90%
the blood flow is not happening.

01:45:14.990 --> 01:45:15.790 align:middle line:90%
Let's go there.

01:45:15.790 --> 01:45:18.450 align:middle line:90%


01:45:18.450 --> 01:45:20.880 align:middle line:84%
What I just said, if you
understood what I just said,

01:45:20.880 --> 01:45:24.150 align:middle line:84%
you understand so
much about injuries.

01:45:24.150 --> 01:45:26.862 align:middle line:84%
Of course there's no
parasites, so there

01:45:26.862 --> 01:45:28.320 align:middle line:84%
wouldn't be anything
that would get

01:45:28.320 --> 01:45:31.440 align:middle line:84%
into necrotic damaged tissue
from an injury that could then

01:45:31.440 --> 01:45:33.550 align:middle line:84%
lead on to arthritic
problems later.

01:45:33.550 --> 01:45:34.350 align:middle line:90%
Of course not.

01:45:34.350 --> 01:45:36.570 align:middle line:84%
That would be crazy to
suggest such a problem.

01:45:36.570 --> 01:45:41.080 align:middle line:84%
But in my reality, I ain't
allowing that to happen.

01:45:41.080 --> 01:45:44.880 align:middle line:84%
So with that injury, I'm going
to have the zapper on it 24/7.

01:45:44.880 --> 01:45:46.200 align:middle line:90%
I slept with it last night.

01:45:46.200 --> 01:45:47.617 align:middle line:84%
And when I woke
up this morning, I

01:45:47.617 --> 01:45:49.140 align:middle line:84%
was like, damn,
it's a lot better.

01:45:49.140 --> 01:45:50.460 align:middle line:90%
It was a lot better.

01:45:50.460 --> 01:45:51.930 align:middle line:90%
I was like, whoa.

01:45:51.930 --> 01:45:52.980 align:middle line:90%
It's shocking.

01:45:52.980 --> 01:45:54.120 align:middle line:90%
It's a shocker.

01:45:54.120 --> 01:45:57.390 align:middle line:84%
And what I love about
it is it's so simple.

01:45:57.390 --> 01:46:00.390 align:middle line:90%
It's childishly simple.

01:46:00.390 --> 01:46:01.990 align:middle line:90%
Any kid can make this.

01:46:01.990 --> 01:46:02.790 align:middle line:90%
You can make that.

01:46:02.790 --> 01:46:06.750 align:middle line:84%
It's a 555 Radio Shack switcher,
which is 15 times per second,

01:46:06.750 --> 01:46:09.220 align:middle line:84%
so it's on, off, on,
off, on, off, on, off,

01:46:09.220 --> 01:46:12.463 align:middle line:84%
on, off, can be run off a 9-volt
battery, two little electrodes.

01:46:12.463 --> 01:46:13.380 align:middle line:90%
They could be pennies.

01:46:13.380 --> 01:46:14.760 align:middle line:84%
You don't have-- let's say
you don't have little copper

01:46:14.760 --> 01:46:15.560 align:middle line:90%
pieces.

01:46:15.560 --> 01:46:16.920 align:middle line:90%
Use pennies.

01:46:16.920 --> 01:46:19.410 align:middle line:84%
And just put the pennies on
there and just go like that

01:46:19.410 --> 01:46:20.927 align:middle line:90%
and that's all you need.

01:46:20.927 --> 01:46:23.010 align:middle line:84%
I've worked this out that
this could even be done,

01:46:23.010 --> 01:46:24.660 align:middle line:90%
you could take a Leyden jar.

01:46:24.660 --> 01:46:27.420 align:middle line:84%
You could be running a
potter's wheel right.

01:46:27.420 --> 01:46:30.570 align:middle line:84%
You could be like, Stone Age
technology that could go on,

01:46:30.570 --> 01:46:33.960 align:middle line:84%
off, on, off, on, off, on,
off, on, off, on, off, on off.

01:46:33.960 --> 01:46:35.540 align:middle line:84%
And with lemon
juice, you could be

01:46:35.540 --> 01:46:39.120 align:middle line:84%
producing a current that could
create a zapper with a potter's

01:46:39.120 --> 01:46:41.340 align:middle line:84%
wheel just by holding
two electrodes like this,

01:46:41.340 --> 01:46:43.620 align:middle line:84%
if you wanted to go
back to caveman times.

01:46:43.620 --> 01:46:46.170 align:middle line:84%
Not that there ever
were caveman times.

01:46:46.170 --> 01:46:48.840 align:middle line:84%
I don't believe in
caveman times, I'm sorry.

01:46:48.840 --> 01:46:51.990 align:middle line:84%
I've committed a massive
sacrilege against our scientism

01:46:51.990 --> 01:46:52.890 align:middle line:90%
religion, I know.

01:46:52.890 --> 01:46:55.097 align:middle line:90%
I apologize for that one.

01:46:55.097 --> 01:46:57.430 align:middle line:84%
It's great down here, but I
probably should get back up.

01:46:57.430 --> 01:46:59.210 align:middle line:90%
OK, let's keep going.

01:46:59.210 --> 01:47:02.656 align:middle line:90%


01:47:02.656 --> 01:47:04.976 align:middle line:10%
>> [INAUDIBLE]

01:47:04.976 --> 01:47:06.613 align:middle line:10%
>> Oh, jeez.

01:47:06.613 --> 01:47:07.530 align:middle line:10%
That is the end of it.

01:47:07.530 --> 01:47:07.870 align:middle line:10%
Oh, there.

01:47:07.870 --> 01:47:09.870 align:middle line:10%
That's the one I wanted
to show you guys.

01:47:09.870 --> 01:47:12.398 align:middle line:10%
So I took Novak over to
Dragon Herbs one day,

01:47:12.398 --> 01:47:14.940 align:middle line:10%
and I was like, dude, you've
got to see this mushroom they've

01:47:14.940 --> 01:47:15.740 align:middle line:10%
got over there.

01:47:15.740 --> 01:47:20.482 align:middle line:90%


01:47:20.482 --> 01:47:22.440 align:middle line:10%
One of the biggest reishi
mushrooms ever found.

01:47:22.440 --> 01:47:25.860 align:middle line:90%


01:47:25.860 --> 01:47:27.300 align:middle line:10%
When he goes to
the side, and when

01:47:27.300 --> 01:47:30.780 align:middle line:10%
you see Novak on the side of
the court drinking his drink,

01:47:30.780 --> 01:47:32.460 align:middle line:10%
guess what's in there?

01:47:32.460 --> 01:47:41.370 align:middle line:84%
Goji berry, schisandra,
phycocyanin, sea salt,

01:47:41.370 --> 01:47:51.420 align:middle line:84%
spring water, oftentimes
chaga tea, lemon.

01:47:51.420 --> 01:47:54.570 align:middle line:84%
That's what's in
that water bottle.

01:47:54.570 --> 01:47:55.410 align:middle line:90%
Just for you guys.

01:47:55.410 --> 01:47:57.350 align:middle line:84%
I wouldn't put that
out in the public.

01:47:57.350 --> 01:47:59.942 align:middle line:84%
If you tuned in on a live
stream, you got that.

01:47:59.942 --> 01:48:03.240 align:middle line:90%
>> [INAUDIBLE]

01:48:03.240 --> 01:48:04.420 align:middle line:90%
>> It is absolutely allowed.

01:48:04.420 --> 01:48:05.220 align:middle line:90%
>> It is?

01:48:05.220 --> 01:48:07.670 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes, totally.

01:48:07.670 --> 01:48:08.910 align:middle line:90%
There's no steroids in there.

01:48:08.910 --> 01:48:11.915 align:middle line:90%
It's just food.

01:48:11.915 --> 01:48:13.840 align:middle line:84%
If you see also,
then, he'll drink

01:48:13.840 --> 01:48:16.270 align:middle line:84%
that and he'll usually
take a bite out of a banana

01:48:16.270 --> 01:48:19.700 align:middle line:84%
and he's right back into
it, right back in the deal.

01:48:19.700 --> 01:48:22.300 align:middle line:84%
Let me tell you what this
means for tennis players

01:48:22.300 --> 01:48:24.130 align:middle line:90%
and athletes.

01:48:24.130 --> 01:48:26.320 align:middle line:84%
If you're aware,
if you're awake,

01:48:26.320 --> 01:48:29.920 align:middle line:90%
you have an unfair advantage.

01:48:29.920 --> 01:48:31.450 align:middle line:90%
You have an unfair advantage.

01:48:31.450 --> 01:48:33.540 align:middle line:84%
Nobody's on herbs in that
whole-- there's nobody

01:48:33.540 --> 01:48:36.630 align:middle line:84%
touching-- reishi mushroom
in the World Tennis Tour?

01:48:36.630 --> 01:48:38.890 align:middle line:90%
Nobody even knows what that is.

01:48:38.890 --> 01:48:41.370 align:middle line:84%
Chaga tea in the World
Tennis Tournament?

01:48:41.370 --> 01:48:43.090 align:middle line:84%
Nobody-- they don't
know what that is.

01:48:43.090 --> 01:48:44.363 align:middle line:90%
They never heard of it.

01:48:44.363 --> 01:48:45.280 align:middle line:90%
Why would you do that?

01:48:45.280 --> 01:48:46.320 align:middle line:90%
That's like herbs.

01:48:46.320 --> 01:48:47.280 align:middle line:90%
That's like, toxic.

01:48:47.280 --> 01:48:50.430 align:middle line:84%
You're supposed
to take medicine.

01:48:50.430 --> 01:48:53.380 align:middle line:84%
If you want an unfair
advantage in your life,

01:48:53.380 --> 01:48:55.930 align:middle line:84%
this is the way you're
going to get it.

01:48:55.930 --> 01:48:58.050 align:middle line:84%
You have an advantage,
because everyone else

01:48:58.050 --> 01:49:01.150 align:middle line:84%
is gassing out on their toxic
food, their toxic coffee,

01:49:01.150 --> 01:49:01.950 align:middle line:90%
right?

01:49:01.950 --> 01:49:02.950 align:middle line:90%
It's not organic coffee.

01:49:02.950 --> 01:49:05.760 align:middle line:84%
Most of the time people go out
for coffee, it's not organic.

01:49:05.760 --> 01:49:07.388 align:middle line:84%
Bulletproof coffee
is not organic.

01:49:07.388 --> 01:49:09.430 align:middle line:84%
It's amazing to me how
many people come up to me,

01:49:09.430 --> 01:49:10.900 align:middle line:84%
and they're like, bulletproof
coffee, bulletproof coffee.

01:49:10.900 --> 01:49:12.720 align:middle line:84%
And I'm like, OK, yeah, but
you know it's not organic.

01:49:12.720 --> 01:49:15.095 align:middle line:84%
And they're like, no, no, no.
it doesn't have mycotoxins.

01:49:15.095 --> 01:49:16.740 align:middle line:90%
It's not organic.

01:49:16.740 --> 01:49:19.470 align:middle line:84%
It's sprayed with
chemicals, bro.

01:49:19.470 --> 01:49:21.330 align:middle line:90%
Like, snap out of it.

01:49:21.330 --> 01:49:22.800 align:middle line:84%
Like, we're not
into the chemical

01:49:22.800 --> 01:49:24.960 align:middle line:84%
spraying around here,
because the chemical spraying

01:49:24.960 --> 01:49:27.510 align:middle line:90%
is going to lead to lymphomas.

01:49:27.510 --> 01:49:30.510 align:middle line:84%
It's going to lead to the
non Hodgkin's lymphomas,

01:49:30.510 --> 01:49:32.370 align:middle line:84%
it's going to lead
to the leukemias,

01:49:32.370 --> 01:49:34.330 align:middle line:84%
it's going to lead
to the tumors.

01:49:34.330 --> 01:49:36.104 align:middle line:90%
It's going to lead to--

01:49:36.104 --> 01:49:38.670 align:middle line:90%
you know the rest of the story.

01:49:38.670 --> 01:49:40.860 align:middle line:84%
The long list of
human diseases now

01:49:40.860 --> 01:49:44.205 align:middle line:84%
that just goes on,
and on, and on, just

01:49:44.205 --> 01:49:46.080 align:middle line:84%
like the list of chemicals
in the environment

01:49:46.080 --> 01:49:49.560 align:middle line:90%
goes on, and on, and on.

01:49:49.560 --> 01:49:52.960 align:middle line:84%
Did you guys hear the
latest news yesterday?

01:49:52.960 --> 01:49:59.190 align:middle line:84%
70% of the blood supply in,
I think it was in the UK,

01:49:59.190 --> 01:50:00.900 align:middle line:90%
contaminated with Xanax.

01:50:00.900 --> 01:50:01.840 align:middle line:90%
>> Wow.

01:50:01.840 --> 01:50:04.660 align:middle line:90%


01:50:04.660 --> 01:50:06.430 align:middle line:90%
>> 70%.

01:50:06.430 --> 01:50:07.630 align:middle line:90%
It's just, it's so--

01:50:07.630 --> 01:50:08.450 align:middle line:90%
it's beyond crazy.

01:50:08.450 --> 01:50:09.250 align:middle line:90%
It's beyond.

01:50:09.250 --> 01:50:10.125 align:middle line:90%
It's beyond anything.

01:50:10.125 --> 01:50:11.350 align:middle line:90%
It's beyond.

01:50:11.350 --> 01:50:14.290 align:middle line:84%
But meanwhile, David
Wolfe, what a quack.

01:50:14.290 --> 01:50:16.900 align:middle line:90%


01:50:16.900 --> 01:50:20.290 align:middle line:84%
What a charlatan that he
would actually promote

01:50:20.290 --> 01:50:23.170 align:middle line:84%
herbs, or have the best
tennis player in the world,

01:50:23.170 --> 01:50:25.810 align:middle line:84%
bring him all the way back
from a career-ending injury

01:50:25.810 --> 01:50:28.780 align:middle line:84%
back to number one
again, total faker.

01:50:28.780 --> 01:50:30.020 align:middle line:90%
Charlatan.

01:50:30.020 --> 01:50:32.030 align:middle line:90%
Nobody.

01:50:32.030 --> 01:50:34.370 align:middle line:84%
We need doctors,
only doctors know,

01:50:34.370 --> 01:50:35.690 align:middle line:90%
because they've been educated.

01:50:35.690 --> 01:50:39.200 align:middle line:84%
This guy, even though I have
two engineering degrees,

01:50:39.200 --> 01:50:41.385 align:middle line:84%
even though I have a degree
in political science,

01:50:41.385 --> 01:50:43.010 align:middle line:84%
even though I have
a degree, a master's

01:50:43.010 --> 01:50:45.590 align:middle line:84%
in nutrition, even though
I have a degree in law.

01:50:45.590 --> 01:50:48.710 align:middle line:84%
But that's, you know, those
aren't the credentials we want.

01:50:48.710 --> 01:50:52.520 align:middle line:84%
So screw you, buddy, you
don't have the credentials.

01:50:52.520 --> 01:50:53.882 align:middle line:90%
You're not scientific.

01:50:53.882 --> 01:50:59.560 align:middle line:90%


01:50:59.560 --> 01:51:01.600 align:middle line:90%
So stupid.

01:51:01.600 --> 01:51:05.753 align:middle line:90%
It's so ridiculously obvious.

01:51:05.753 --> 01:51:06.670 align:middle line:90%
Everything is obvious.

01:51:06.670 --> 01:51:07.545 align:middle line:90%
Oh wait, oops, sorry.

01:51:07.545 --> 01:51:08.367 align:middle line:90%
I'm going this way.

01:51:08.367 --> 01:51:09.950 align:middle line:84%
Look at all those
little baby reishis.

01:51:09.950 --> 01:51:11.492 align:middle line:84%
Do you see those
reishis right there?

01:51:11.492 --> 01:51:13.220 align:middle line:90%


01:51:13.220 --> 01:51:14.020 align:middle line:90%
Look at this.

01:51:14.020 --> 01:51:14.978 align:middle line:90%
This is a little video.

01:51:14.978 --> 01:51:16.430 align:middle line:10%
Watch.

01:51:16.430 --> 01:51:17.460 align:middle line:10%
Yay.

01:51:17.460 --> 01:51:18.260 align:middle line:10%
Oh wait, no.

01:51:18.260 --> 01:51:20.480 align:middle line:10%
That's not the video.

01:51:20.480 --> 01:51:23.665 align:middle line:10%
That's another little baby.

01:51:23.665 --> 01:51:25.402 align:middle line:90%
OK, let's get back.

01:51:25.402 --> 01:51:26.860 align:middle line:84%
I want to do the
last final colors,

01:51:26.860 --> 01:51:28.180 align:middle line:84%
and then I want to do
questions and answers,

01:51:28.180 --> 01:51:29.975 align:middle line:84%
because I've gone
over my 20 minutes.

01:51:29.975 --> 01:51:30.850 align:middle line:90%
I apologize for that.

01:51:30.850 --> 01:51:32.800 align:middle line:90%
It's been 22 minutes.

01:51:32.800 --> 01:51:34.420 align:middle line:90%
Hang on tight.

01:51:34.420 --> 01:51:35.220 align:middle line:90%
There we go.

01:51:35.220 --> 01:51:38.150 align:middle line:10%
Let's do the last little bits
here, because this bit on Jing

01:51:38.150 --> 01:51:39.950 align:middle line:10%
is really important.

01:51:39.950 --> 01:51:40.900 align:middle line:10%
So we go through blue.

01:51:40.900 --> 01:51:41.900 align:middle line:10%
Blue is the hardest one.

01:51:41.900 --> 01:51:44.960 align:middle line:10%
Purple, purple is a central
nervous system protector

01:51:44.960 --> 01:51:49.190 align:middle line:10%
and nervous system protector,
which means your gut, too.

01:51:49.190 --> 01:51:53.270 align:middle line:10%
We know that our entire
axis, the whole vagus nerve

01:51:53.270 --> 01:51:56.480 align:middle line:10%
region from the gut all the
way to the brain, everything

01:51:56.480 --> 01:52:00.500 align:middle line:10%
in here is actually the
seat of our consciousness.

01:52:00.500 --> 01:52:01.723 align:middle line:90%
It's very interesting.

01:52:01.723 --> 01:52:03.890 align:middle line:84%
And then a lot of that has
to do with our digestion.

01:52:03.890 --> 01:52:05.300 align:middle line:90%
Purple protects that.

01:52:05.300 --> 01:52:06.860 align:middle line:90%
So what's the best purple?

01:52:06.860 --> 01:52:09.020 align:middle line:90%
I like purple cabbage juice.

01:52:09.020 --> 01:52:11.300 align:middle line:90%
I like purple berries.

01:52:11.300 --> 01:52:12.830 align:middle line:90%
I like purple people eaters.

01:52:12.830 --> 01:52:16.143 align:middle line:90%


01:52:16.143 --> 01:52:17.560 align:middle line:84%
See, there's a way
if you're like,

01:52:17.560 --> 01:52:18.396 align:middle line:90%
[SNORES]

01:52:18.396 --> 01:52:19.900 align:middle line:90%
>> Purple kush.

01:52:19.900 --> 01:52:20.700 align:middle line:90%
>> Purple what?

01:52:20.700 --> 01:52:21.600 align:middle line:90%
>> Purple kush.

01:52:21.600 --> 01:52:22.410 align:middle line:90%
>> Purple kush.

01:52:22.410 --> 01:52:24.870 align:middle line:90%
>> [INAUDIBLE]

01:52:24.870 --> 01:52:27.050 align:middle line:90%
>> Purple is amazing.

01:52:27.050 --> 01:52:29.120 align:middle line:84%
When you get to the purple,
you know that you're

01:52:29.120 --> 01:52:30.610 align:middle line:90%
in that noble thing.

01:52:30.610 --> 01:52:31.520 align:middle line:90%
It makes us human.

01:52:31.520 --> 01:52:33.160 align:middle line:90%
It's our consciousness.

01:52:33.160 --> 01:52:34.880 align:middle line:90%
It's our consciousness.

01:52:34.880 --> 01:52:37.543 align:middle line:90%
Brown, brown is so obvious.

01:52:37.543 --> 01:52:38.960 align:middle line:84%
The reason why
people drink coffee

01:52:38.960 --> 01:52:41.960 align:middle line:84%
in the morning most of
the time is because,

01:52:41.960 --> 01:52:46.660 align:middle line:84%
is because, it's
going to do its thing.

01:52:46.660 --> 01:52:48.700 align:middle line:84%
And that means you're
going to be pooping.

01:52:48.700 --> 01:52:53.055 align:middle line:90%
And brown foods causes to poop.

01:52:53.055 --> 01:52:54.430 align:middle line:84%
It's interesting
about chocolate.

01:52:54.430 --> 01:52:56.080 align:middle line:84%
Chocolate is purple,
brown, black.

01:52:56.080 --> 01:52:57.400 align:middle line:90%
Those are its natural colors.

01:52:57.400 --> 01:52:58.902 align:middle line:90%
Look at those three colors.

01:52:58.902 --> 01:53:01.360 align:middle line:84%
You've got the purple, the
noble essence, the consciousness

01:53:01.360 --> 01:53:02.160 align:middle line:90%
protector.

01:53:02.160 --> 01:53:04.490 align:middle line:10%
You've got the brown,
pooping, that's good.

01:53:04.490 --> 01:53:06.740 align:middle line:10%
And you've got the black,
which we're going to get to,

01:53:06.740 --> 01:53:08.490 align:middle line:10%
which is our Jing, our
primordial essence,

01:53:08.490 --> 01:53:11.350 align:middle line:10%
our survival, our
ability to stay alive.

01:53:11.350 --> 01:53:12.315 align:middle line:90%
And then white.

01:53:12.315 --> 01:53:14.440 align:middle line:84%
White is-- when somebody's
digestively broken down,

01:53:14.440 --> 01:53:16.565 align:middle line:84%
they've been all the way
broken down to the bottom,

01:53:16.565 --> 01:53:18.340 align:middle line:84%
then we get them
on the white foods.

01:53:18.340 --> 01:53:19.440 align:middle line:84%
Not that you shouldn't
have white food.

01:53:19.440 --> 01:53:20.350 align:middle line:90%
You've got to have white foods.

01:53:20.350 --> 01:53:22.060 align:middle line:84%
But white foods are
always the basis.

01:53:22.060 --> 01:53:23.380 align:middle line:90%
They're always the beginning.

01:53:23.380 --> 01:53:25.600 align:middle line:84%
So for a mother, you
have a brand new baby.

01:53:25.600 --> 01:53:27.100 align:middle line:84%
What's the first
thing that happens?

01:53:27.100 --> 01:53:28.000 align:middle line:90%
>> Milk.

01:53:28.000 --> 01:53:29.140 align:middle line:90%
>> And what color is that milk?

01:53:29.140 --> 01:53:29.770 align:middle line:90%
>> White.

01:53:29.770 --> 01:53:30.700 align:middle line:90%
>> White.

01:53:30.700 --> 01:53:32.128 align:middle line:84%
Now, the hind milk,
a lot of times

01:53:32.128 --> 01:53:33.670 align:middle line:84%
if you get into the
hind milk, you'll

01:53:33.670 --> 01:53:35.813 align:middle line:84%
see a little bit of a
yellow in there, right?

01:53:35.813 --> 01:53:37.480 align:middle line:84%
And that's for the
growth of new tissue.

01:53:37.480 --> 01:53:40.070 align:middle line:84%
Yellow is very important
for growth of new tissue.

01:53:40.070 --> 01:53:41.980 align:middle line:90%
But the white is the beginning.

01:53:41.980 --> 01:53:44.020 align:middle line:84%
And that's something
that you-- if you ever--

01:53:44.020 --> 01:53:46.600 align:middle line:84%
a lot of people watching, a lot
of people in the group here,

01:53:46.600 --> 01:53:48.130 align:middle line:84%
you work in the health
field, and you get people

01:53:48.130 --> 01:53:49.360 align:middle line:90%
who can't digest anything.

01:53:49.360 --> 01:53:51.527 align:middle line:84%
They're down to like, three
foods that they can eat,

01:53:51.527 --> 01:53:52.900 align:middle line:90%
or five foods that they can eat.

01:53:52.900 --> 01:53:55.300 align:middle line:84%
And that's when we get them
back to the white foods.

01:53:55.300 --> 01:53:56.790 align:middle line:84%
So we'll take like
a coconut kefir,

01:53:56.790 --> 01:53:59.200 align:middle line:84%
and we'll go, OK start
with this, coconut kefir.

01:53:59.200 --> 01:54:00.640 align:middle line:90%
We'll get them on to white rice.

01:54:00.640 --> 01:54:01.730 align:middle line:84%
That's the only thing
that can digest,

01:54:01.730 --> 01:54:04.600 align:middle line:84%
and that can act as a binder
for somebody in that situation.

01:54:04.600 --> 01:54:07.420 align:middle line:84%
We'll get them on the white
rice protein or brown rice

01:54:07.420 --> 01:54:09.090 align:middle line:90%
protein, which is white.

01:54:09.090 --> 01:54:11.090 align:middle line:84%
So they can at least get
their protein fraction.

01:54:11.090 --> 01:54:12.550 align:middle line:84%
And if they're
really in bad shape,

01:54:12.550 --> 01:54:14.380 align:middle line:84%
and I see people like this
all the time, you know,

01:54:14.380 --> 01:54:16.720 align:middle line:84%
people come to me and they're
like, they're down to 10 foods

01:54:16.720 --> 01:54:17.960 align:middle line:90%
and they can't eat anything.

01:54:17.960 --> 01:54:19.870 align:middle line:84%
It's like, if I eat that,
I have an allergy to that.

01:54:19.870 --> 01:54:20.500 align:middle line:90%
Or I eat this.

01:54:20.500 --> 01:54:22.540 align:middle line:84%
So they're actually in
a point of malnutrition,

01:54:22.540 --> 01:54:25.720 align:middle line:84%
because it's been going
on oftentimes for years.

01:54:25.720 --> 01:54:27.580 align:middle line:84%
And this is where this
piece of information

01:54:27.580 --> 01:54:32.050 align:middle line:84%
comes in really valuable,
because white food is a reset.

01:54:32.050 --> 01:54:33.830 align:middle line:90%
Now then we get to black.

01:54:33.830 --> 01:54:37.000 align:middle line:10%
Now, black is my personal
favorite of all the colors,

01:54:37.000 --> 01:54:40.040 align:middle line:10%
because it represents Jing,
primordial life essence,

01:54:40.040 --> 01:54:41.590 align:middle line:10%
your ability to survive.

01:54:41.590 --> 01:54:44.230 align:middle line:10%
The way we think about
this, Chi, which is red,

01:54:44.230 --> 01:54:45.130 align:middle line:10%
we go back up to red.

01:54:45.130 --> 01:54:46.172 align:middle line:10%
You remember red up here.

01:54:46.172 --> 01:54:48.400 align:middle line:10%
Blood, heart strengthening,
but volatile.

01:54:48.400 --> 01:54:52.190 align:middle line:10%
Chi has to do with like,
the first round in a fight.

01:54:52.190 --> 01:54:54.810 align:middle line:10%
It's like, OK, we're
watching Muhammad Ali.

01:54:54.810 --> 01:54:56.950 align:middle line:10%
Muhammad Ali's first
round, that's Chi.

01:54:56.950 --> 01:55:00.460 align:middle line:10%
That's going to be your speed,
your reflexes, the way you

01:55:00.460 --> 01:55:02.290 align:middle line:10%
move and mobilize energy.

01:55:02.290 --> 01:55:04.370 align:middle line:84%
Your immune system has a
lot to do with your Chi.

01:55:04.370 --> 01:55:06.370 align:middle line:84%
The way you move and
mobilize your immune system

01:55:06.370 --> 01:55:07.720 align:middle line:90%
has to do with Chi.

01:55:07.720 --> 01:55:09.770 align:middle line:84%
But if we keep going
deeper into that battle,

01:55:09.770 --> 01:55:12.460 align:middle line:84%
and let's say we're in round
15 against Joe Frazier,

01:55:12.460 --> 01:55:15.220 align:middle line:84%
it's going to be
Jing that's going

01:55:15.220 --> 01:55:17.230 align:middle line:90%
to keep you going in round 15.

01:55:17.230 --> 01:55:19.510 align:middle line:84%
So the thing about
eucommia that's interesting

01:55:19.510 --> 01:55:21.250 align:middle line:90%
is, yes, it's for elasticity.

01:55:21.250 --> 01:55:22.240 align:middle line:90%
Yes, it's for joints.

01:55:22.240 --> 01:55:24.880 align:middle line:84%
Yes, it's for protecting
connective tissue,

01:55:24.880 --> 01:55:28.085 align:middle line:84%
you know, in the case of Novak
with his arm, but it's black.

01:55:28.085 --> 01:55:30.220 align:middle line:90%
It's a black substance.

01:55:30.220 --> 01:55:32.590 align:middle line:84%
And that's to me
very interesting.

01:55:32.590 --> 01:55:33.890 align:middle line:90%
It's a black substance.

01:55:33.890 --> 01:55:36.940 align:middle line:90%
So it is for the long haul.

01:55:36.940 --> 01:55:41.345 align:middle line:84%
If you want to live a long
time, black substance.

01:55:41.345 --> 01:55:43.720 align:middle line:84%
And this is-- when I got to
the charcoal, I was like, oh,

01:55:43.720 --> 01:55:44.650 align:middle line:90%
interesting.

01:55:44.650 --> 01:55:46.910 align:middle line:90%
It's black, of course.

01:55:46.910 --> 01:55:48.680 align:middle line:90%
So now we know what it does.

01:55:48.680 --> 01:55:50.860 align:middle line:84%
OK, that's my spiel
on the colors.

01:55:50.860 --> 01:55:53.350 align:middle line:84%
We did get a little bit
into Rudolf Steiner, which

01:55:53.350 --> 01:55:56.050 align:middle line:84%
I do want to reiterate one piece
about Rudolph Steiner that's

01:55:56.050 --> 01:55:56.898 align:middle line:90%
very interesting.

01:55:56.898 --> 01:55:58.690 align:middle line:84%
Rudolph Steiner's
cosmology is that there's

01:55:58.690 --> 01:56:00.160 align:middle line:84%
the creative force
in the middle,

01:56:00.160 --> 01:56:03.560 align:middle line:84%
and that there is two major
parasitic forces on each side

01:56:03.560 --> 01:56:04.810 align:middle line:90%
that we have to be careful of.

01:56:04.810 --> 01:56:07.060 align:middle line:84%
To put it in the most blunt
terms, one is materialism,

01:56:07.060 --> 01:56:09.130 align:middle line:90%
and the other is escapism.

01:56:09.130 --> 01:56:12.430 align:middle line:84%
So one is materialism, which
is the material thinking.

01:56:12.430 --> 01:56:14.950 align:middle line:84%
Material belongings are
going to improve my life.

01:56:14.950 --> 01:56:18.340 align:middle line:84%
Material phones, and I've
got to have the best phone,

01:56:18.340 --> 01:56:19.990 align:middle line:90%
it's going to be the best ever.

01:56:19.990 --> 01:56:21.580 align:middle line:90%
That's kind of materialism.

01:56:21.580 --> 01:56:24.220 align:middle line:84%
And the escapism
has to do with the,

01:56:24.220 --> 01:56:27.680 align:middle line:84%
I need to give over my
power to someone else.

01:56:27.680 --> 01:56:30.230 align:middle line:84%
I need the-- I don't
know, doctor knows.

01:56:30.230 --> 01:56:31.910 align:middle line:90%
I don't know, guru knows.

01:56:31.910 --> 01:56:33.830 align:middle line:84%
I don't know,
religious leader knows.

01:56:33.830 --> 01:56:34.720 align:middle line:90%
I don't know.

01:56:34.720 --> 01:56:35.970 align:middle line:90%
That's giving your power away.

01:56:35.970 --> 01:56:37.310 align:middle line:90%
That's escapism.

01:56:37.310 --> 01:56:41.040 align:middle line:84%
It can also even degenerate all
the way into alcohol and drugs.

01:56:41.040 --> 01:56:44.540 align:middle line:84%
So between those is where we
find that creative center.

01:56:44.540 --> 01:56:47.180 align:middle line:84%
So it's a balance,
it's a golden mean.

01:56:47.180 --> 01:56:48.650 align:middle line:84%
If you know about
Rudolf Steiner,

01:56:48.650 --> 01:56:51.020 align:middle line:84%
you know that he's
Aristotle reincarnated.

01:56:51.020 --> 01:56:51.840 align:middle line:90%
That's who he is.

01:56:51.840 --> 01:56:53.540 align:middle line:84%
I believe in reincarnation,
because the evidence

01:56:53.540 --> 01:56:54.860 align:middle line:90%
and the science is behind it.

01:56:54.860 --> 01:56:58.280 align:middle line:84%
The scientism isn't
behind it, but the science

01:56:58.280 --> 01:56:59.930 align:middle line:90%
is definitely behind it.

01:56:59.930 --> 01:57:02.450 align:middle line:84%
Referencing Max Tucker's
works, Ian Stevenson's work,

01:57:02.450 --> 01:57:03.600 align:middle line:90%
and many amazing people.

01:57:03.600 --> 01:57:04.400 align:middle line:90%
Brian Weiss.

01:57:04.400 --> 01:57:05.780 align:middle line:90%
Many lives, many masters.

01:57:05.780 --> 01:57:07.070 align:middle line:90%
All that kind of stuff.

01:57:07.070 --> 01:57:08.570 align:middle line:84%
If you start digging
into it, you'll

01:57:08.570 --> 01:57:11.810 align:middle line:84%
find out that there is an
incredible body of research

01:57:11.810 --> 01:57:15.950 align:middle line:84%
of kids who knew things about,
like, I used to be this person.

01:57:15.950 --> 01:57:16.850 align:middle line:90%
I lived over here.

01:57:16.850 --> 01:57:18.090 align:middle line:90%
This object is over there.

01:57:18.090 --> 01:57:19.160 align:middle line:84%
I'm telling you,
it's over there.

01:57:19.160 --> 01:57:19.850 align:middle line:90%
This is over there.

01:57:19.850 --> 01:57:20.660 align:middle line:90%
That's there.

01:57:20.660 --> 01:57:22.370 align:middle line:84%
And between the
ages of two and six,

01:57:22.370 --> 01:57:23.537 align:middle line:90%
these things can surface up.

01:57:23.537 --> 01:57:25.245 align:middle line:84%
And then typically by
the time the person

01:57:25.245 --> 01:57:26.720 align:middle line:84%
gets to their
seventh year, it all

01:57:26.720 --> 01:57:30.020 align:middle line:84%
starts to diminish away
from the past life.

01:57:30.020 --> 01:57:31.970 align:middle line:90%
That's where I'm coming from.

01:57:31.970 --> 01:57:35.330 align:middle line:84%
Now, Rudolf Steiner says
that when you get sucked

01:57:35.330 --> 01:57:38.978 align:middle line:84%
into one of these valleys, these
parasitic things of escapism,

01:57:38.978 --> 01:57:40.520 align:middle line:84%
then typically what
ends up happening

01:57:40.520 --> 01:57:42.645 align:middle line:84%
is you come out on the
other side in the next life,

01:57:42.645 --> 01:57:44.395 align:middle line:84%
trying to get you back
towards the middle.

01:57:44.395 --> 01:57:46.600 align:middle line:84%
So if somebody is very
what he would say luciferic

01:57:46.600 --> 01:57:48.350 align:middle line:84%
in the sense of they
gave their power away

01:57:48.350 --> 01:57:50.617 align:middle line:84%
or they got into alcohol
and drugs, in the next life

01:57:50.617 --> 01:57:52.700 align:middle line:84%
they're going to come back
as being more Ahrimanic

01:57:52.700 --> 01:57:54.680 align:middle line:84%
in the sense of
more materialistic,

01:57:54.680 --> 01:57:55.730 align:middle line:84%
and they're going to
be like, no, no, no,

01:57:55.730 --> 01:57:57.480 align:middle line:84%
science is going to
figure everything out,

01:57:57.480 --> 01:58:00.240 align:middle line:84%
and they get into the
scientism side of stuff.

01:58:00.240 --> 01:58:02.330 align:middle line:84%
And what you your
soul is trying to do

01:58:02.330 --> 01:58:04.700 align:middle line:84%
is trying to get you back
to the creative middle,

01:58:04.700 --> 01:58:06.933 align:middle line:84%
the creative center
of your being.

01:58:06.933 --> 01:58:08.600 align:middle line:84%
And that's something
I want to bring up,

01:58:08.600 --> 01:58:10.700 align:middle line:84%
because a lot of
times in our world,

01:58:10.700 --> 01:58:13.380 align:middle line:84%
we're dealing with
family members, friends,

01:58:13.380 --> 01:58:15.705 align:middle line:84%
people we know and
care about very deeply,

01:58:15.705 --> 01:58:17.330 align:middle line:84%
who have gotten into
drugs and alcohol.

01:58:17.330 --> 01:58:19.038 align:middle line:84%
And we're like, what
do we do about this?

01:58:19.038 --> 01:58:21.050 align:middle line:84%
Or the other side, people
who have gotten super

01:58:21.050 --> 01:58:22.370 align:middle line:90%
into scientism.

01:58:22.370 --> 01:58:24.290 align:middle line:90%
They're super into materialism.

01:58:24.290 --> 01:58:25.675 align:middle line:90%
And what do we do to help them?

01:58:25.675 --> 01:58:27.050 align:middle line:84%
The best way to
help these people

01:58:27.050 --> 01:58:29.120 align:middle line:84%
is to get them into
creating, and stay

01:58:29.120 --> 01:58:30.710 align:middle line:90%
in the creative center.

01:58:30.710 --> 01:58:33.830 align:middle line:84%
And creation is where all
of these things disappear.

01:58:33.830 --> 01:58:35.480 align:middle line:84%
Whenever you're
coloring, creating

01:58:35.480 --> 01:58:37.340 align:middle line:84%
art, whenever you're
doing what you love,

01:58:37.340 --> 01:58:38.180 align:middle line:90%
whenever you're gardening.

01:58:38.180 --> 01:58:40.070 align:middle line:84%
Maybe it's gardening, maybe
it's-- whatever your favorite

01:58:40.070 --> 01:58:40.940 align:middle line:90%
thing is to do.

01:58:40.940 --> 01:58:42.020 align:middle line:90%
You're in your creative center.

01:58:42.020 --> 01:58:43.420 align:middle line:90%
All those things just disappear.

01:58:43.420 --> 01:58:45.003 align:middle line:84%
They're not even
part of your reality.

01:58:45.003 --> 01:58:47.180 align:middle line:90%
Is this correct?

01:58:47.180 --> 01:58:49.250 align:middle line:84%
We're not suddenly
going, like, we're not

01:58:49.250 --> 01:58:52.100 align:middle line:84%
in our midst of gardening
and being like, oh yeah,

01:58:52.100 --> 01:58:53.210 align:middle line:90%
my tomatoes are coming in.

01:58:53.210 --> 01:58:58.140 align:middle line:84%
Then we're going, the
Big Bang created us.

01:58:58.140 --> 01:58:59.890 align:middle line:84%
The whole thing is a
complete abstraction.

01:58:59.890 --> 01:59:01.260 align:middle line:90%
It's totally nonsense.

01:59:01.260 --> 01:59:04.560 align:middle line:90%
It's a total abstraction.

01:59:04.560 --> 01:59:07.650 align:middle line:84%
And scientism, by the way,
is very deeply involved

01:59:07.650 --> 01:59:11.320 align:middle line:84%
in getting us into
abstract mathematics.

01:59:11.320 --> 01:59:13.320 align:middle line:84%
And this is another thing
that Steiner warned us

01:59:13.320 --> 01:59:14.550 align:middle line:90%
of very strongly.

01:59:14.550 --> 01:59:16.530 align:middle line:84%
There was one other person that
we didn't get into today that I

01:59:16.530 --> 01:59:18.000 align:middle line:84%
love very much,
and that I think is

01:59:18.000 --> 01:59:21.780 align:middle line:84%
a very interesting character
in the field of research

01:59:21.780 --> 01:59:23.340 align:middle line:90%
is Charles Fort.

01:59:23.340 --> 01:59:26.850 align:middle line:84%
And I'll show you Charles
Fort's famous books.

01:59:26.850 --> 01:59:29.768 align:middle line:84%
I always bring him
in, because I just

01:59:29.768 --> 01:59:31.560 align:middle line:84%
feel like he needs a
champion in the world.

01:59:31.560 --> 01:59:33.268 align:middle line:84%
And he never had his
champion, because he

01:59:33.268 --> 01:59:35.730 align:middle line:90%
died in 1935, or '34, '36.

01:59:35.730 --> 01:59:36.780 align:middle line:90%
Somewhere in there.

01:59:36.780 --> 01:59:38.580 align:middle line:84%
Anyway, this is Charles
Fort's four books.

01:59:38.580 --> 01:59:41.430 align:middle line:84%
"The Book of the Damned",
"Lo", "Wild Talents",

01:59:41.430 --> 01:59:42.360 align:middle line:90%
and "New Lands".

01:59:42.360 --> 01:59:47.760 align:middle line:84%
And what Charles Fort presents
in his books is information

01:59:47.760 --> 01:59:51.840 align:middle line:84%
that was excluded, that you
were not allowed to see,

01:59:51.840 --> 01:59:54.600 align:middle line:84%
that didn't fit the paradigm,
so we had to get rid of it

01:59:54.600 --> 01:59:56.310 align:middle line:90%
and get rid of it quickly.

01:59:56.310 --> 01:59:58.260 align:middle line:84%
We had to get rid of
the Paluxy River find.

01:59:58.260 --> 01:59:59.280 align:middle line:90%
We've got to tuck that under.

01:59:59.280 --> 02:00:01.030 align:middle line:84%
We don't want anybody
knowing that there's

02:00:01.030 --> 02:00:03.680 align:middle line:84%
a human foot and a dinosaur
footprint in the same strata.

02:00:03.680 --> 02:00:06.570 align:middle line:84%
It's been heavily tested, and
they are in the same strata,

02:00:06.570 --> 02:00:10.647 align:middle line:84%
and they are tested to be
produced at the same time.

02:00:10.647 --> 02:00:12.730 align:middle line:84%
We can't have that, so
we've got to get rid of it.

02:00:12.730 --> 02:00:14.130 align:middle line:90%
That's the data we excluded.

02:00:14.130 --> 02:00:17.040 align:middle line:84%
What Charles Fort
says is we damned it.

02:00:17.040 --> 02:00:18.462 align:middle line:90%
We got rid of it.

02:00:18.462 --> 02:00:19.920 align:middle line:10%
Now if you're
somebody who's really

02:00:19.920 --> 02:00:21.930 align:middle line:10%
wanting to open up
to the truth, which

02:00:21.930 --> 02:00:26.040 align:middle line:10%
is every bit of information,
not just the information that's

02:00:26.040 --> 02:00:27.900 align:middle line:10%
allowed in, Charles
Fort will help

02:00:27.900 --> 02:00:29.358 align:middle line:10%
you do that, because
he'll help you

02:00:29.358 --> 02:00:30.840 align:middle line:10%
get to the right philosophy.

02:00:30.840 --> 02:00:33.045 align:middle line:84%
And the right philosophy
is, we accept all of it.

02:00:33.045 --> 02:00:34.170 align:middle line:90%
We're looking at all of it.

02:00:34.170 --> 02:00:35.910 align:middle line:84%
Not that we believe
all of it, but we're

02:00:35.910 --> 02:00:37.812 align:middle line:90%
going to look at all of it.

02:00:37.812 --> 02:00:39.270 align:middle line:84%
And we're going to
bring it all in,

02:00:39.270 --> 02:00:40.890 align:middle line:84%
and we're going to go,
OK, it could be this.

02:00:40.890 --> 02:00:41.370 align:middle line:90%
Could be that.

02:00:41.370 --> 02:00:41.880 align:middle line:90%
It might be this.

02:00:41.880 --> 02:00:42.680 align:middle line:90%
It might be that.

02:00:42.680 --> 02:00:47.530 align:middle line:84%
We don't get stuck into it
has to be my creation story

02:00:47.530 --> 02:00:49.396 align:middle line:90%
or my life is ruined.

02:00:49.396 --> 02:00:53.824 align:middle line:90%


02:00:53.824 --> 02:00:57.910 align:middle line:84%
Oh god, if my creation
story isn't true, then what?

02:00:57.910 --> 02:01:01.360 align:middle line:90%


02:01:01.360 --> 02:01:03.850 align:middle line:90%
It's absurd.

02:01:03.850 --> 02:01:08.590 align:middle line:84%
It's an absurd-- it's
a childish absurdity.

02:01:08.590 --> 02:01:11.350 align:middle line:84%
And that's what Charles
Fort brings to bear.

02:01:11.350 --> 02:01:13.020 align:middle line:90%
He brings that up.

02:01:13.020 --> 02:01:14.498 align:middle line:90%
It's wonderful.

02:01:14.498 --> 02:01:16.540 align:middle line:84%
And then when it comes,
by the way, to nutrition,

02:01:16.540 --> 02:01:18.290 align:middle line:84%
we've looked at a lot
of different things.

02:01:18.290 --> 02:01:20.050 align:middle line:84%
We've looked at
foods, superfoods.

02:01:20.050 --> 02:01:21.880 align:middle line:90%
We've looked at super herbs.

02:01:21.880 --> 02:01:24.130 align:middle line:84%
But none of that stuff
can do anything for you

02:01:24.130 --> 02:01:25.570 align:middle line:90%
unless you actually take it.

02:01:25.570 --> 02:01:27.215 align:middle line:84%
So all you have to
do is just say yes.

02:01:27.215 --> 02:01:28.840 align:middle line:84%
I have a thing with
me like wheatgrass.

02:01:28.840 --> 02:01:30.070 align:middle line:84%
Somebody comes up to me,
and they're like, here.

02:01:30.070 --> 02:01:31.237 align:middle line:90%
Here's your wheatgrass shot.

02:01:31.237 --> 02:01:35.920 align:middle line:84%
Guess what my internal
direction of that always is?

02:01:35.920 --> 02:01:38.120 align:middle line:90%
I take it.

02:01:38.120 --> 02:01:39.228 align:middle line:90%
I always say yes.

02:01:39.228 --> 02:01:41.270 align:middle line:84%
Somebody comes at me with
wheatgrass, it's a yes.

02:01:41.270 --> 02:01:43.540 align:middle line:90%


02:01:43.540 --> 02:01:45.540 align:middle line:84%
Somebody comes at me with
whatever, usually, I'm

02:01:45.540 --> 02:01:47.430 align:middle line:84%
going to be like, OK,
yeah, I'll try that.

02:01:47.430 --> 02:01:50.823 align:middle line:84%
Turmeric shot, yep,
must be what I need.

02:01:50.823 --> 02:01:51.990 align:middle line:90%
Here, here's your green tea.

02:01:51.990 --> 02:01:53.840 align:middle line:90%
OK, yep, taking it.

02:01:53.840 --> 02:01:55.430 align:middle line:84%
Do you want your
chaga reishi extract?

02:01:55.430 --> 02:01:57.410 align:middle line:90%
Yep.

02:01:57.410 --> 02:01:59.000 align:middle line:90%
You got it, I'm taking it.

02:01:59.000 --> 02:02:00.530 align:middle line:84%
And then you open
yourself up to it,

02:02:00.530 --> 02:02:02.840 align:middle line:84%
and it's amazing what would
just be handed to you.

02:02:02.840 --> 02:02:05.450 align:middle line:90%
It's just, it blows my mind.

02:02:05.450 --> 02:02:07.910 align:middle line:90%
Just here, there's the thing.

02:02:07.910 --> 02:02:12.950 align:middle line:84%
And instead of denying the
moment, you accept the moment

02:02:12.950 --> 02:02:15.830 align:middle line:90%
and receive it.

02:02:15.830 --> 02:02:21.730 align:middle line:84%
I recently went back to the
Eckhart Tolle teachings of now.

02:02:21.730 --> 02:02:24.160 align:middle line:84%
There's so much going
on to deny the moment,

02:02:24.160 --> 02:02:25.480 align:middle line:90%
to try to escape the moment.

02:02:25.480 --> 02:02:26.753 align:middle line:90%
So much going on.

02:02:26.753 --> 02:02:28.170 align:middle line:84%
And all you have
to do is just go,

02:02:28.170 --> 02:02:29.590 align:middle line:90%
no, I'm receiving the moment.

02:02:29.590 --> 02:02:31.757 align:middle line:84%
Oh, you want-- you're gifting
me this in the moment?

02:02:31.757 --> 02:02:32.570 align:middle line:90%
I'll take it.

02:02:32.570 --> 02:02:33.370 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

02:02:33.370 --> 02:02:34.205 align:middle line:90%
>> Thank you.

02:02:34.205 --> 02:02:35.080 align:middle line:90%
>> Thanks, everybody.

02:02:35.080 --> 02:02:37.730 align:middle line:90%
That was great.

02:02:37.730 --> 02:02:40.600 align:middle line:84%
I hope it was as entertaining
for you as it was for me.

02:02:40.600 --> 02:02:42.320 align:middle line:90%
That was.

02:02:42.320 --> 02:02:49.000 align:middle line:90%
