00:00:02.856 --> 00:00:06.200 align:middle line:90%


00:00:06.200 --> 00:00:07.700 align:middle line:84%
>> Thank you Mary
for being here.

00:00:07.700 --> 00:00:08.500 align:middle line:90%
>> Thank you.

00:00:08.500 --> 00:00:10.280 align:middle line:84%
>> Mary Rodwell,
let's give her a hand.

00:00:10.280 --> 00:00:12.200 align:middle line:90%
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:13.160 align:middle line:90%
>> Thanks.

00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:15.650 align:middle line:90%
>> Thank you.

00:00:15.650 --> 00:00:17.630 align:middle line:90%
>> Well, good afternoon.

00:00:17.630 --> 00:00:19.820 align:middle line:10%
It's an absolute
pleasure to share

00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:23.330 align:middle line:10%
some of what I'm
learning constantly,

00:00:23.330 --> 00:00:27.530 align:middle line:10%
which is making me change and
understand more and more how

00:00:27.530 --> 00:00:29.750 align:middle line:10%
little I know.

00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:32.750 align:middle line:84%
So I'm going to start with,
there's a lot in this.

00:00:32.750 --> 00:00:35.230 align:middle line:84%
So you're not going to
be allowed to sleep.

00:00:35.230 --> 00:00:36.380 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:38.820 align:middle line:84%
If you blink, you're
going to miss something.

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:42.500 align:middle line:84%
So I've got a lot to get
through in a short time.

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:44.660 align:middle line:84%
But I hope that it's going
to make sense to you.

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:48.390 align:middle line:84%
There is so much around
contact that I want to share

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:50.840 align:middle line:84%
and how important it
is that we understand

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:53.180 align:middle line:90%
what's going on on this planet.

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:56.743 align:middle line:84%
So to start with, this is the
awakening, as many people--

00:00:56.743 --> 00:00:58.160 align:middle line:84%
well, you wouldn't
be in this room

00:00:58.160 --> 00:01:01.550 align:middle line:90%
if you weren't part of that.

00:01:01.550 --> 00:01:04.340 align:middle line:84%
"How Extraterrestrial Contact
Can Transform Your Life"

00:01:04.340 --> 00:01:07.400 align:middle line:84%
was the book that
I wrote in 2002.

00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:09.950 align:middle line:84%
Realizing even then,
all those years

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:14.270 align:middle line:84%
ago now, that it
transformed lives.

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:17.750 align:middle line:84%
And since then, the
research has in fact

00:01:17.750 --> 00:01:20.330 align:middle line:84%
demonstrated exactly
the same thing.

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:24.590 align:middle line:84%
And I am part of an organization
called the Dr. Ed Mitchell Free

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:25.490 align:middle line:90%
Foundation.

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:29.900 align:middle line:84%
And in the surveys that we've
done in Beyond UFOs with 4,200

00:01:29.900 --> 00:01:36.710 align:middle line:84%
people demonstrated some very
interesting understanding

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:40.290 align:middle line:84%
of what this is and how
it does transform lives.

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:42.920 align:middle line:84%
But one of the things
we've discovered is this,

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:46.430 align:middle line:84%
it doesn't happen necessarily
because you've seen a UFO

00:01:46.430 --> 00:01:48.110 align:middle line:90%
or been on a UFO.

00:01:48.110 --> 00:01:50.360 align:middle line:84%
It may happen that
you start to connect

00:01:50.360 --> 00:01:53.690 align:middle line:84%
with these intelligences through
having a near-death experience,

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:56.180 align:middle line:84%
or an out-of-body
experience, or you may

00:01:56.180 --> 00:01:58.910 align:middle line:90%
have had a shamanic experience.

00:01:58.910 --> 00:02:02.210 align:middle line:84%
You may have in fact started
learning remote viewing

00:02:02.210 --> 00:02:05.330 align:middle line:90%
or meditating.

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:08.270 align:middle line:84%
Anything that raises
your consciousness

00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:11.390 align:middle line:84%
will allow you to
access the realms.

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:14.470 align:middle line:84%
And in those realms
are everything.

00:02:14.470 --> 00:02:17.060 align:middle line:84%
Whether you want to think
about the angelic realms,

00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:21.080 align:middle line:84%
or the fairy realm, or these
non-human intelligences,

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:22.760 align:middle line:90%
some of which are physical.

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:25.580 align:middle line:84%
I believe now that some
are interdimensional,

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:28.190 align:middle line:84%
trans-dimensional,
extra-dimensional, and even

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:29.700 align:middle line:90%
some visitors from our future.

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:32.310 align:middle line:90%
So why do I say that?

00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:35.790 align:middle line:84%
The first thing that
was most profound

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:38.100 align:middle line:84%
in terms of our
research was this,

00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:43.890 align:middle line:84%
we discovered that only
25% of contact is physical.

00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:45.810 align:middle line:84%
And that's why so many
people don't bring back

00:02:45.810 --> 00:02:48.240 align:middle line:90%
bits of the craft I suspect.

00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:50.700 align:middle line:90%
75% is non-physical.

00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:55.920 align:middle line:84%
We go onto these craft
in a non-physical state.

00:02:55.920 --> 00:02:58.890 align:middle line:84%
Very fascinating to me
is the numbers of people

00:02:58.890 --> 00:03:02.520 align:middle line:84%
that say this, they
remember past-life origins

00:03:02.520 --> 00:03:05.250 align:middle line:84%
on other planets and
other dimensions.

00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:09.310 align:middle line:84%
And not only adults have told
me this but children as well.

00:03:09.310 --> 00:03:11.070 align:middle line:84%
And this is one of
them, my contact

00:03:11.070 --> 00:03:13.050 align:middle line:84%
with non-human
cosmic race of beings

00:03:13.050 --> 00:03:15.910 align:middle line:84%
has occurred since
before I was born.

00:03:15.910 --> 00:03:17.820 align:middle line:84%
These beings were
my family before I

00:03:17.820 --> 00:03:19.590 align:middle line:90%
came to be in the earth domain.

00:03:19.590 --> 00:03:21.780 align:middle line:10%
I had a close
relationship with them,

00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:24.240 align:middle line:10%
which continued after my birth.

00:03:24.240 --> 00:03:27.270 align:middle line:10%
And I have many stories,
many, many stories,

00:03:27.270 --> 00:03:28.290 align:middle line:10%
of the same thing.

00:03:28.290 --> 00:03:30.450 align:middle line:10%
And I see a beautiful
lady in the audience who

00:03:30.450 --> 00:03:33.360 align:middle line:10%
knows exactly what this
is about, Barbara Lamb.

00:03:33.360 --> 00:03:36.226 align:middle line:10%
And it's a pleasure to
have you here, Barbara.

00:03:36.226 --> 00:03:37.026 align:middle line:10%
Thank you.

00:03:37.026 --> 00:03:38.318 align:middle line:90%
[APPLAUSE]

00:03:38.318 --> 00:03:41.800 align:middle line:90%


00:03:41.800 --> 00:03:44.320 align:middle line:84%
One of the fascinating
ways people

00:03:44.320 --> 00:03:47.020 align:middle line:84%
demonstrate their experience
is through artwork.

00:03:47.020 --> 00:03:49.270 align:middle line:84%
And my next workshop
will be to show

00:03:49.270 --> 00:03:51.880 align:middle line:84%
the many ways,
creative ways, people

00:03:51.880 --> 00:03:54.520 align:middle line:84%
demonstrate they've
had experiences.

00:03:54.520 --> 00:03:56.480 align:middle line:84%
But this is one
by Lloyd Canning.

00:03:56.480 --> 00:04:00.010 align:middle line:84%
He, in fact, was kind enough to
do the cover of my second book.

00:04:00.010 --> 00:04:03.760 align:middle line:10%
He's showing here how they've
been with us, our ancestors,

00:04:03.760 --> 00:04:05.170 align:middle line:10%
all through history.

00:04:05.170 --> 00:04:10.480 align:middle line:10%
And there you can see it in
this wonderful painting of his.

00:04:10.480 --> 00:04:12.820 align:middle line:84%
But the most
important thing here

00:04:12.820 --> 00:04:16.269 align:middle line:84%
is our connection
to these ancestors.

00:04:16.269 --> 00:04:18.940 align:middle line:84%
And this is what Tracy
Taylor said when she tool--

00:04:18.940 --> 00:04:23.260 align:middle line:84%
when she was told about her
origins on this planet before.

00:04:23.260 --> 00:04:25.720 align:middle line:84%
One night, I had this
intense feeling before sleep.

00:04:25.720 --> 00:04:28.660 align:middle line:84%
I wrote in a process where I
had little control, something

00:04:28.660 --> 00:04:30.250 align:middle line:90%
beyond my present understanding.

00:04:30.250 --> 00:04:33.310 align:middle line:84%
It was contrary to everything
I'd ever been taught.

00:04:33.310 --> 00:04:36.920 align:middle line:84%
It said the human race had been
created by extraterrestrials.

00:04:36.920 --> 00:04:39.340 align:middle line:84%
It contained information
about genetic manipulation

00:04:39.340 --> 00:04:45.190 align:middle line:84%
of human and extraterrestrial
DNA to create another species.

00:04:45.190 --> 00:04:49.150 align:middle line:84%
Well, the Aborigines, the
indigenous peoples globally

00:04:49.150 --> 00:04:51.040 align:middle line:90%
already know this.

00:04:51.040 --> 00:04:53.000 align:middle line:84%
And it's time we listened
a little bit more.

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:56.350 align:middle line:10%
This is a wonderful painting
by artist Teddy Chessles

00:04:56.350 --> 00:05:01.540 align:middle line:10%
of the star people visiting
the Aborigines in Australia.

00:05:01.540 --> 00:05:03.130 align:middle line:10%
There's another
beautiful painting

00:05:03.130 --> 00:05:05.500 align:middle line:10%
by an Aboriginal artist.

00:05:05.500 --> 00:05:08.800 align:middle line:10%
And this is what she
said about this painting.

00:05:08.800 --> 00:05:10.360 align:middle line:10%
Life on the stars
beyond the Milky

00:05:10.360 --> 00:05:14.440 align:middle line:10%
Way, the connection to the
Seven Sisters constellation.

00:05:14.440 --> 00:05:16.660 align:middle line:10%
The planets are half
a day's journey.

00:05:16.660 --> 00:05:18.580 align:middle line:10%
The beings are very
friendly and just watch

00:05:18.580 --> 00:05:20.260 align:middle line:10%
the Aboriginal way of life.

00:05:20.260 --> 00:05:22.810 align:middle line:10%
They have no guns,
spears, or weapons.

00:05:22.810 --> 00:05:25.180 align:middle line:10%
The air on their planet is food.

00:05:25.180 --> 00:05:27.640 align:middle line:10%
The green uniforms protect
from Earth diseases.

00:05:27.640 --> 00:05:29.800 align:middle line:10%
The space people
speak all languages.

00:05:29.800 --> 00:05:32.590 align:middle line:10%
The elders say the space people
showed them how to grow food,

00:05:32.590 --> 00:05:34.900 align:middle line:10%
find water, and
showed them how to use

00:05:34.900 --> 00:05:36.520 align:middle line:10%
amethyst stones for healing.

00:05:36.520 --> 00:05:39.160 align:middle line:90%


00:05:39.160 --> 00:05:44.190 align:middle line:84%
So to put a baseline on this, in
terms of our own understanding

00:05:44.190 --> 00:05:48.210 align:middle line:84%
of who are origins
are, Dr. Francis Crick,

00:05:48.210 --> 00:05:50.280 align:middle line:84%
co-founder of the
DNA molecule, said

00:05:50.280 --> 00:05:52.830 align:middle line:84%
some very interesting
things about what he

00:05:52.830 --> 00:05:56.070 align:middle line:90%
believed about our human DNA.

00:05:56.070 --> 00:05:58.650 align:middle line:84%
And he said this, for
life to form by chance

00:05:58.650 --> 00:06:01.860 align:middle line:84%
is mathematically,
virtually impossible.

00:06:01.860 --> 00:06:04.530 align:middle line:84%
The immensity of complex,
coded, and precisely

00:06:04.530 --> 00:06:08.220 align:middle line:84%
sequenced information is
absolutely staggering.

00:06:08.220 --> 00:06:10.740 align:middle line:84%
The DNA evidence
speaks of intelligent,

00:06:10.740 --> 00:06:13.080 align:middle line:90%
information-bearing design.

00:06:13.080 --> 00:06:16.050 align:middle line:84%
They programmed the
molecules that when

00:06:16.050 --> 00:06:18.510 align:middle line:84%
we reached a certain
level of intelligence,

00:06:18.510 --> 00:06:22.000 align:middle line:84%
we would know more
about ourselves.

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:24.000 align:middle line:84%
So what did the--
they, the ancestors,

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:26.400 align:middle line:90%
program into human DNA?

00:06:26.400 --> 00:06:29.190 align:middle line:84%
They programmed DNA so
that some evolutionary

00:06:29.190 --> 00:06:31.230 align:middle line:84%
point we would have
access to information that

00:06:31.230 --> 00:06:33.150 align:middle line:90%
would teach us about ourselves.

00:06:33.150 --> 00:06:36.150 align:middle line:84%
Does this mean we will
understand our hybridization

00:06:36.150 --> 00:06:37.870 align:middle line:90%
or something more profound?

00:06:37.870 --> 00:06:39.450 align:middle line:90%
I think it's both.

00:06:39.450 --> 00:06:42.270 align:middle line:84%
Hybridization and more,
because already we

00:06:42.270 --> 00:06:45.150 align:middle line:84%
have whistleblower
geneticists saying,

00:06:45.150 --> 00:06:47.490 align:middle line:84%
there is no doubt
that we have been--

00:06:47.490 --> 00:06:49.260 align:middle line:90%
had DNA added to us.

00:06:49.260 --> 00:06:51.690 align:middle line:84%
But we also have had
been spliced and put

00:06:51.690 --> 00:06:53.340 align:middle line:90%
back together again.

00:06:53.340 --> 00:06:55.320 align:middle line:84%
And in the free surveys
that we've done,

00:06:55.320 --> 00:06:59.730 align:middle line:84%
26% of those that
were surveyed said

00:06:59.730 --> 00:07:03.755 align:middle line:84%
that they'd gained information
about the upgrading of DNA.

00:07:03.755 --> 00:07:05.130 align:middle line:84%
And we have evidence
that we have

00:07:05.130 --> 00:07:09.090 align:middle line:84%
been visited by many
different types of beings

00:07:09.090 --> 00:07:10.590 align:middle line:90%
across this planet.

00:07:10.590 --> 00:07:12.860 align:middle line:90%
And here we've got Akhenaten.

00:07:12.860 --> 00:07:15.690 align:middle line:84%
And Akhenaten, you remember,
in the pharaohs they always

00:07:15.690 --> 00:07:18.710 align:middle line:84%
said they were descended,
they were sons of gods.

00:07:18.710 --> 00:07:20.940 align:middle line:84%
And this fragment that
is being shown here

00:07:20.940 --> 00:07:22.740 align:middle line:84%
suggests that he
had a higher cranial

00:07:22.740 --> 00:07:26.490 align:middle line:84%
capacity because of a need
to house a larger cortex.

00:07:26.490 --> 00:07:30.360 align:middle line:84%
And the gene CXPAC-5,
responsible for cortex growth,

00:07:30.360 --> 00:07:33.990 align:middle line:84%
suggests an anomaly
visible in the image below.

00:07:33.990 --> 00:07:36.240 align:middle line:84%
I'm just setting the
scene here before I

00:07:36.240 --> 00:07:39.360 align:middle line:84%
want you to embrace
the information that I

00:07:39.360 --> 00:07:40.500 align:middle line:90%
want to offer you.

00:07:40.500 --> 00:07:43.980 align:middle line:84%
But I want to give you
something really tangible here.

00:07:43.980 --> 00:07:48.210 align:middle line:84%
Upgrading of human DNA, even
the children that have gone up

00:07:48.210 --> 00:07:52.140 align:middle line:84%
on the craft, I remember one
8-year-old really excited

00:07:52.140 --> 00:07:55.230 align:middle line:84%
to tell me that she'd been
taken up on board craft.

00:07:55.230 --> 00:07:58.650 align:middle line:84%
And amongst showing her how to
use her intuitive abilities,

00:07:58.650 --> 00:08:01.230 align:middle line:84%
her psychic abilities
and how to levitate,

00:08:01.230 --> 00:08:03.960 align:middle line:84%
she said she was shown
genetic engineering

00:08:03.960 --> 00:08:05.100 align:middle line:90%
of different species.

00:08:05.100 --> 00:08:08.070 align:middle line:84%
Because she said they
seed other planets

00:08:08.070 --> 00:08:10.950 align:middle line:84%
around this galaxy
and many others.

00:08:10.950 --> 00:08:12.900 align:middle line:84%
This is what this
13-year-old from Canada

00:08:12.900 --> 00:08:15.810 align:middle line:84%
said when his brother and
himself went up on the craft.

00:08:15.810 --> 00:08:18.330 align:middle line:84%
And he drew the
being that he'd seen.

00:08:18.330 --> 00:08:21.030 align:middle line:84%
And he said, I felt these
beings were like scientists,

00:08:21.030 --> 00:08:22.440 align:middle line:90%
were curious about us.

00:08:22.440 --> 00:08:24.870 align:middle line:84%
I was told it was something
to do with genetics.

00:08:24.870 --> 00:08:28.550 align:middle line:90%


00:08:28.550 --> 00:08:30.620 align:middle line:84%
Since that time,
much information

00:08:30.620 --> 00:08:34.220 align:middle line:84%
has come in around
the Mantis beings.

00:08:34.220 --> 00:08:35.760 align:middle line:90%
And many people have seen them.

00:08:35.760 --> 00:08:38.900 align:middle line:84%
Many people have
interacted with them.

00:08:38.900 --> 00:08:41.659 align:middle line:84%
This particular
lady from Australia

00:08:41.659 --> 00:08:44.900 align:middle line:84%
told me this she had an
interaction with the Mantis

00:08:44.900 --> 00:08:46.820 align:middle line:90%
beings, with the tall ones.

00:08:46.820 --> 00:08:49.520 align:middle line:84%
They're under benevolent,
she said, reptilians.

00:08:49.520 --> 00:08:51.650 align:middle line:84%
They took me to a
massive lab, built

00:08:51.650 --> 00:08:53.600 align:middle line:90%
inside a cave-like structure.

00:08:53.600 --> 00:08:55.430 align:middle line:84%
There were thousands
of incubators

00:08:55.430 --> 00:08:57.050 align:middle line:90%
with hybrids in them.

00:08:57.050 --> 00:09:00.260 align:middle line:84%
The Mantis being told
me, they, the mantis,

00:09:00.260 --> 00:09:02.120 align:middle line:84%
were the keepers
of the universe.

00:09:02.120 --> 00:09:05.180 align:middle line:84%
They had blueprints and DNA
for every species that's

00:09:05.180 --> 00:09:09.830 align:middle line:84%
ever been existing, including
extinct species on our planet.

00:09:09.830 --> 00:09:12.980 align:middle line:84%
They populate planets with life
forms throughout the universe.

00:09:12.980 --> 00:09:14.930 align:middle line:84%
They said they were
proficient at genetically

00:09:14.930 --> 00:09:16.610 align:middle line:90%
modifying humans.

00:09:16.610 --> 00:09:21.510 align:middle line:84%
They saw their roles
as master geneticists.

00:09:21.510 --> 00:09:25.370 align:middle line:84%
So contact, what is
actually going on here?

00:09:25.370 --> 00:09:27.320 align:middle line:90%
What's it all about?

00:09:27.320 --> 00:09:29.810 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to talk to
you about the many ways

00:09:29.810 --> 00:09:33.290 align:middle line:84%
now that we are being
activated, or our DNA

00:09:33.290 --> 00:09:38.030 align:middle line:84%
is being activated to embrace
and understand our heritage.

00:09:38.030 --> 00:09:41.780 align:middle line:84%
And there's going to be a lot
of visual arts, energetic music,

00:09:41.780 --> 00:09:45.140 align:middle line:84%
scripts language, healing
planetary, encounters

00:09:45.140 --> 00:09:47.000 align:middle line:90%
with non-human intelligences.

00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:49.040 align:middle line:84%
And it's all to
do with frequency.

00:09:49.040 --> 00:09:51.410 align:middle line:84%
As Nikola Tesla
said, that we are--

00:09:51.410 --> 00:09:55.640 align:middle line:84%
but we are biological beings,
and the brain and the earth

00:09:55.640 --> 00:09:58.610 align:middle line:84%
itself work on the
same frequencies.

00:09:58.610 --> 00:10:01.100 align:middle line:84%
But basically, it's
all about frequency.

00:10:01.100 --> 00:10:03.470 align:middle line:10%
If you want to find the
secrets of the universe,

00:10:03.470 --> 00:10:06.320 align:middle line:10%
think in terms of energy,
frequency, and vibration.

00:10:06.320 --> 00:10:09.050 align:middle line:10%


00:10:09.050 --> 00:10:12.400 align:middle line:10%
One of the ladies that I had the
pleasure of meeting and working

00:10:12.400 --> 00:10:16.780 align:middle line:10%
with for my book was a
medical doctor in Melbourne.

00:10:16.780 --> 00:10:19.780 align:middle line:10%
She had something
happen to her in India,

00:10:19.780 --> 00:10:22.030 align:middle line:10%
a profound experience.

00:10:22.030 --> 00:10:25.030 align:middle line:10%
And she found that
after that experience

00:10:25.030 --> 00:10:30.910 align:middle line:10%
that she was activated in a way
where she was able to activate

00:10:30.910 --> 00:10:32.380 align:middle line:10%
other people and their DNA.

00:10:32.380 --> 00:10:37.000 align:middle line:10%
She calls herself now a shamanic
medical doctor, if you like.

00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:42.290 align:middle line:10%
I describe myself as a galactic
DNA-- galactic DNA rewirer.

00:10:42.290 --> 00:10:46.330 align:middle line:10%
And the activation comes through
in a galactic connection.

00:10:46.330 --> 00:10:48.280 align:middle line:10%
And she also said
this, I feel we're

00:10:48.280 --> 00:10:51.160 align:middle line:10%
changing from carbon-based
to crystalline.

00:10:51.160 --> 00:10:54.820 align:middle line:10%
DNA is changed by frequency.

00:10:54.820 --> 00:10:58.480 align:middle line:84%
People don't realize that the
matrix is galactic, she said.

00:10:58.480 --> 00:11:00.190 align:middle line:84%
The gods of the old
religions are really

00:11:00.190 --> 00:11:02.650 align:middle line:84%
multi-dimensional
galactic beings.

00:11:02.650 --> 00:11:05.920 align:middle line:84%
I feel I've become a modern
shaman, who better-- who

00:11:05.920 --> 00:11:08.440 align:middle line:90%
better than one trained in 3D.

00:11:08.440 --> 00:11:12.310 align:middle line:84%
I can activate the blueprint
of my DNA and my patient's DNA,

00:11:12.310 --> 00:11:15.940 align:middle line:84%
splicing their DNA using
energy and frequency.

00:11:15.940 --> 00:11:17.530 align:middle line:90%
The new DNA looks golden.

00:11:17.530 --> 00:11:19.870 align:middle line:84%
As this is inserted,
the rest of the DNA

00:11:19.870 --> 00:11:22.000 align:middle line:90%
lights up for abilities.

00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:26.560 align:middle line:84%
I believe the new children
are already activated.

00:11:26.560 --> 00:11:29.350 align:middle line:84%
And this is a former
scientist that

00:11:29.350 --> 00:11:31.630 align:middle line:84%
had an activation
with Doctor Batchelor.

00:11:31.630 --> 00:11:34.190 align:middle line:84%
And she said something
very interesting.

00:11:34.190 --> 00:11:36.700 align:middle line:84%
And I don't know how many of
you have seen Lucy the film.

00:11:36.700 --> 00:11:38.470 align:middle line:84%
But if you haven't,
you'll understand what

00:11:38.470 --> 00:11:40.660 align:middle line:90%
I'm referring to afterwards.

00:11:40.660 --> 00:11:42.880 align:middle line:84%
She said this after
the activation.

00:11:42.880 --> 00:11:45.370 align:middle line:84%
Oh my goodness, I
can see the matrix

00:11:45.370 --> 00:11:48.550 align:middle line:84%
and what happened to the
codes, all the transmissions.

00:11:48.550 --> 00:11:50.290 align:middle line:90%
I'm like Lucy in the movie.

00:11:50.290 --> 00:11:51.380 align:middle line:90%
We're in a matrix.

00:11:51.380 --> 00:11:54.310 align:middle line:84%
I can see the craft overhead,
transmitting frequencies

00:11:54.310 --> 00:11:55.420 align:middle line:90%
to the people.

00:11:55.420 --> 00:11:58.540 align:middle line:84%
I see codes, like bar codes,
being put into their heads.

00:11:58.540 --> 00:12:00.550 align:middle line:90%
I see everyone is programmed.

00:12:00.550 --> 00:12:01.930 align:middle line:90%
I see programs coming in.

00:12:01.930 --> 00:12:03.640 align:middle line:90%
This has changed my life.

00:12:03.640 --> 00:12:04.890 align:middle line:90%
I see things differently.

00:12:04.890 --> 00:12:06.220 align:middle line:90%
It's interdimensional.

00:12:06.220 --> 00:12:09.940 align:middle line:10%
And the new DNA looked golden

00:12:09.940 --> 00:12:13.620 align:middle line:10%
So how does this all begin?

00:12:13.620 --> 00:12:16.710 align:middle line:84%
The ghost messenger from the
constellation of Delphius,

00:12:16.710 --> 00:12:18.720 align:middle line:90%
who is represented by the owls.

00:12:18.720 --> 00:12:23.410 align:middle line:84%
This is a painting by the
Aborigines in Australia.

00:12:23.410 --> 00:12:26.820 align:middle line:84%
And when I was in Australia,
I'm afraid some of my slides

00:12:26.820 --> 00:12:27.820 align:middle line:90%
have moved a little bit.

00:12:27.820 --> 00:12:30.182 align:middle line:90%
But I hope you can see OK.

00:12:30.182 --> 00:12:33.180 align:middle line:84%
This was me in a
place in Australia

00:12:33.180 --> 00:12:35.870 align:middle line:84%
just taking some of
what we call the orbs.

00:12:35.870 --> 00:12:40.200 align:middle line:10%
And no they are not water
globules or dust particles

00:12:40.200 --> 00:12:42.460 align:middle line:10%
that we're talking about here.

00:12:42.460 --> 00:12:44.280 align:middle line:10%
And the reason I can
say that, not only

00:12:44.280 --> 00:12:47.670 align:middle line:10%
from my own experience, but also
a wonderful book that looked

00:12:47.670 --> 00:12:50.290 align:middle line:10%
at the orbs scientifically.

00:12:50.290 --> 00:12:52.710 align:middle line:10%
And this is their
conclusion after researching

00:12:52.710 --> 00:12:56.880 align:middle line:10%
the orbs was this, if the orb
is an emanation from a spirit

00:12:56.880 --> 00:12:59.550 align:middle line:10%
being, it does not take much
of a stretch in imagination

00:12:59.550 --> 00:13:02.790 align:middle line:10%
to think that the spirit being
from which it emanates entirely

00:13:02.790 --> 00:13:05.610 align:middle line:10%
controls its mobility,
appearance, and so on.

00:13:05.610 --> 00:13:07.380 align:middle line:10%
The conclusions
that spirit beings

00:13:07.380 --> 00:13:11.370 align:middle line:10%
are all around us, capable
of changing size and location

00:13:11.370 --> 00:13:15.090 align:middle line:10%
extremely quickly, highly
evolved, and intelligent.

00:13:15.090 --> 00:13:18.510 align:middle line:84%
So I'm now going to show you
some fascinating things I've

00:13:18.510 --> 00:13:23.010 align:middle line:84%
never shown to any other
audience up to now.

00:13:23.010 --> 00:13:29.270 align:middle line:10%
So contact with a ball of light,
what is that ball of light?

00:13:29.270 --> 00:13:33.170 align:middle line:10%
A little boy of nine was telling
me about his experiences.

00:13:33.170 --> 00:13:36.530 align:middle line:10%
He's a little boy that speaks
light language to his mother.

00:13:36.530 --> 00:13:38.490 align:middle line:10%
And his mother answers
in light language.

00:13:38.490 --> 00:13:41.390 align:middle line:10%
Only she said he
knows what I'm saying,

00:13:41.390 --> 00:13:44.420 align:middle line:10%
and I don't understand
what I'm saying.

00:13:44.420 --> 00:13:46.130 align:middle line:10%
And this is how he
described himself.

00:13:46.130 --> 00:13:48.050 align:middle line:10%
I use my spiritual mind.

00:13:48.050 --> 00:13:51.740 align:middle line:10%
Some people in my spiritual
home do not exist anymore.

00:13:51.740 --> 00:13:53.540 align:middle line:10%
I can still connect
through spirits

00:13:53.540 --> 00:13:55.220 align:middle line:10%
so I talk through spirit.

00:13:55.220 --> 00:13:58.370 align:middle line:10%
I do not talk through human,
as I do to another person

00:13:58.370 --> 00:13:59.480 align:middle line:10%
like, hello, how are you?

00:13:59.480 --> 00:14:02.900 align:middle line:10%
In my mind, I speak
my spiritual language.

00:14:02.900 --> 00:14:04.730 align:middle line:10%
I say it through my soul.

00:14:04.730 --> 00:14:07.580 align:middle line:10%
I do it through my mind
and soul mixed together.

00:14:07.580 --> 00:14:10.160 align:middle line:10%
I can talk to other
souls exactly like mine.

00:14:10.160 --> 00:14:12.560 align:middle line:10%
That is how I connect
to my real home.

00:14:12.560 --> 00:14:14.630 align:middle line:10%
This is not my real home.

00:14:14.630 --> 00:14:16.790 align:middle line:84%
I do have a home
here, but I also

00:14:16.790 --> 00:14:19.190 align:middle line:84%
have a home where
I really belong.

00:14:19.190 --> 00:14:21.110 align:middle line:90%
I can see with my eyes closed.

00:14:21.110 --> 00:14:22.850 align:middle line:90%
I can see through other people.

00:14:22.850 --> 00:14:25.040 align:middle line:84%
I go out of my body to
protect other children

00:14:25.040 --> 00:14:27.380 align:middle line:90%
from negative beings.

00:14:27.380 --> 00:14:29.810 align:middle line:90%
This is a 9-year-old.

00:14:29.810 --> 00:14:32.600 align:middle line:84%
This is another
9-year-old that said this,

00:14:32.600 --> 00:14:35.030 align:middle line:84%
the beings are located at
the edge of the universe

00:14:35.030 --> 00:14:36.540 align:middle line:90%
in the white light.

00:14:36.540 --> 00:14:38.870 align:middle line:84%
The light orb is
sent to protect us.

00:14:38.870 --> 00:14:41.390 align:middle line:84%
My little brother has a
blue orb that protects him.

00:14:41.390 --> 00:14:44.750 align:middle line:90%


00:14:44.750 --> 00:14:47.390 align:middle line:84%
This is some
interesting images I

00:14:47.390 --> 00:14:49.820 align:middle line:84%
want to show you, again,
to show that this is not

00:14:49.820 --> 00:14:51.290 align:middle line:90%
dust particles.

00:14:51.290 --> 00:14:52.490 align:middle line:10%
I saw spirits.

00:14:52.490 --> 00:14:55.037 align:middle line:10%
This lady saw spirits
when she was 10.

00:14:55.037 --> 00:14:57.620 align:middle line:10%
In the last nine years, she has
taken orbs, many of these orbs

00:14:57.620 --> 00:14:58.660 align:middle line:10%
with naked eye.

00:14:58.660 --> 00:15:00.950 align:middle line:10%
She has felt quite
safe and part of them.

00:15:00.950 --> 00:15:03.140 align:middle line:10%
I believe they show
themselves to me with love

00:15:03.140 --> 00:15:04.430 align:middle line:10%
and for learning.

00:15:04.430 --> 00:15:07.190 align:middle line:10%
Now interestingly,
you can see the fog.

00:15:07.190 --> 00:15:09.170 align:middle line:10%
And then the orb
that's literally

00:15:09.170 --> 00:15:12.320 align:middle line:10%
embedded in the television.

00:15:12.320 --> 00:15:13.840 align:middle line:10%
It's not external to it.

00:15:13.840 --> 00:15:15.500 align:middle line:10%
It's actually embedded in it.

00:15:15.500 --> 00:15:16.880 align:middle line:10%
And these other
two images you'll

00:15:16.880 --> 00:15:19.910 align:middle line:10%
see with Guy Sebastian,
who's a singer, one part

00:15:19.910 --> 00:15:21.270 align:middle line:10%
is quite normal.

00:15:21.270 --> 00:15:23.030 align:middle line:10%
The other one is slightly faded.

00:15:23.030 --> 00:15:26.930 align:middle line:10%
And all these orbs are embedded
actually in the television.

00:15:26.930 --> 00:15:29.160 align:middle line:10%
And you have to say,
what's going on here?

00:15:29.160 --> 00:15:31.910 align:middle line:10%
Why are they showing
themselves that way?

00:15:31.910 --> 00:15:34.160 align:middle line:84%
Now before I start
this video, I want

00:15:34.160 --> 00:15:36.515 align:middle line:84%
you to realize it's
been slowed down 50%.

00:15:36.515 --> 00:15:39.330 align:middle line:90%


00:15:39.330 --> 00:15:41.390 align:middle line:84%
It was sent to me
by a lady who was

00:15:41.390 --> 00:15:44.030 align:middle line:90%
having experiences in the US.

00:15:44.030 --> 00:15:46.790 align:middle line:84%
And she saw lights coming
through the window.

00:15:46.790 --> 00:15:48.440 align:middle line:90%
She saw them outside.

00:15:48.440 --> 00:15:50.000 align:middle line:84%
And she thought
children were coming

00:15:50.000 --> 00:15:51.410 align:middle line:90%
with torches or something.

00:15:51.410 --> 00:15:54.440 align:middle line:84%
She was trying to understand
what these lights were.

00:15:54.440 --> 00:15:58.220 align:middle line:84%
But she realized there was no
children in the outside doing

00:15:58.220 --> 00:16:01.790 align:middle line:84%
this, but they were doing
all these strange things.

00:16:01.790 --> 00:16:03.410 align:middle line:84%
And this is actually--
these images

00:16:03.410 --> 00:16:06.410 align:middle line:84%
were taken in less than a
minute, and most of the frames

00:16:06.410 --> 00:16:08.810 align:middle line:84%
were literally
fractions of a second.

00:16:08.810 --> 00:16:11.840 align:middle line:84%
Because I was fascinated
to see, is there

00:16:11.840 --> 00:16:13.950 align:middle line:90%
anything else going on there?

00:16:13.950 --> 00:16:17.160 align:middle line:90%
So I did some slowing down.

00:16:17.160 --> 00:16:19.100 align:middle line:90%
Watch this to start with.

00:16:19.100 --> 00:16:21.330 align:middle line:90%
There you are.

00:16:21.330 --> 00:16:24.270 align:middle line:84%
So you're seeing that she's
just taking a bit of video.

00:16:24.270 --> 00:16:27.288 align:middle line:84%
And these are the lights
that she's seeing outside.

00:16:27.288 --> 00:16:28.830 align:middle line:84%
And she's wondering,
oh well, there's

00:16:28.830 --> 00:16:30.070 align:middle line:90%
no children there with them.

00:16:30.070 --> 00:16:34.020 align:middle line:84%
Have you noticed already--
this is slowed down 50%.

00:16:34.020 --> 00:16:35.790 align:middle line:84%
And already you're
seeing strange things

00:16:35.790 --> 00:16:36.870 align:middle line:90%
going on with the lights.

00:16:36.870 --> 00:16:39.690 align:middle line:84%
There's things
moving and morphing

00:16:39.690 --> 00:16:41.255 align:middle line:84%
and what have you
through the whole--

00:16:41.255 --> 00:16:42.630 align:middle line:84%
and it's less than
a minute, this

00:16:42.630 --> 00:16:46.020 align:middle line:90%
is, this whole piece of video.

00:16:46.020 --> 00:16:47.760 align:middle line:84%
Because I wanted to
know, what's actually

00:16:47.760 --> 00:16:49.530 align:middle line:90%
going on with these orbs.

00:16:49.530 --> 00:16:52.530 align:middle line:84%
There's a real sense
that they're intelligent

00:16:52.530 --> 00:16:54.090 align:middle line:90%
and what are they.

00:16:54.090 --> 00:16:57.630 align:middle line:84%
So there's a lot of
information going out

00:16:57.630 --> 00:16:58.690 align:middle line:90%
with all sorts of things.

00:16:58.690 --> 00:17:02.310 align:middle line:84%
Now I want to show
you now what I did.

00:17:02.310 --> 00:17:06.569 align:middle line:84%
In a fraction of a second, I
was noticing all these changes

00:17:06.569 --> 00:17:09.540 align:middle line:90%
in the frames with these orbs.

00:17:09.540 --> 00:17:13.560 align:middle line:84%
And you notice that, suddenly,
you start to see frequencies.

00:17:13.560 --> 00:17:15.119 align:middle line:90%
So I looked at some more.

00:17:15.119 --> 00:17:20.190 align:middle line:84%
Not only are you seeing, again,
really interesting other orbs

00:17:20.190 --> 00:17:25.630 align:middle line:84%
coming in, expansion, movement,
even strange images in there.

00:17:25.630 --> 00:17:27.930 align:middle line:84%
But what was even
more fascinating

00:17:27.930 --> 00:17:31.140 align:middle line:90%
was there were frequencies.

00:17:31.140 --> 00:17:34.390 align:middle line:84%
And that I'd never
seen in orbs before,

00:17:34.390 --> 00:17:35.650 align:middle line:90%
frequencies, frequencies.

00:17:35.650 --> 00:17:39.610 align:middle line:84%
So that's either an
activation or a communication

00:17:39.610 --> 00:17:41.320 align:middle line:90%
going on some level.

00:17:41.320 --> 00:17:44.830 align:middle line:84%
But this was what was actually
embedded in these orbs.

00:17:44.830 --> 00:17:47.360 align:middle line:90%
Here's-- here they are again.

00:17:47.360 --> 00:17:49.520 align:middle line:84%
So what's going on
when we see orbs,

00:17:49.520 --> 00:17:51.410 align:middle line:84%
or when we're taking
pictures of orbs?

00:17:51.410 --> 00:17:53.540 align:middle line:84%
There is something
happening that we may not

00:17:53.540 --> 00:17:55.190 align:middle line:90%
see with our physical eyes.

00:17:55.190 --> 00:17:57.140 align:middle line:90%
But it's there in front of you.

00:17:57.140 --> 00:18:01.130 align:middle line:84%
Now intriguingly and
synchronicically, here we

00:18:01.130 --> 00:18:03.150 align:middle line:90%
are again, more and more.

00:18:03.150 --> 00:18:04.310 align:middle line:90%
What are those frequencies?

00:18:04.310 --> 00:18:07.070 align:middle line:84%
Look at the strange
ones, some like dots,

00:18:07.070 --> 00:18:09.710 align:middle line:90%
some like waves around the orbs.

00:18:09.710 --> 00:18:12.170 align:middle line:10%
You can see the orbs
themselves shifting literally

00:18:12.170 --> 00:18:14.780 align:middle line:10%
in fractions of a second.

00:18:14.780 --> 00:18:19.940 align:middle line:10%
I was sent some video by a
beautiful healer channel,

00:18:19.940 --> 00:18:21.640 align:middle line:10%
Valerie Barlow, who's--

00:18:21.640 --> 00:18:23.930 align:middle line:10%
Barrow should I say, who's
written a couple of books

00:18:23.930 --> 00:18:26.420 align:middle line:10%
on her information
about the origin

00:18:26.420 --> 00:18:30.820 align:middle line:10%
of the species from her
connections to the stars.

00:18:30.820 --> 00:18:33.470 align:middle line:84%
And when she was doing certain
healings and meditation

00:18:33.470 --> 00:18:39.060 align:middle line:84%
through Skype, what was she
getting through Skype, where

00:18:39.060 --> 00:18:41.760 align:middle line:84%
she's doing these
healings and sending out

00:18:41.760 --> 00:18:44.220 align:middle line:90%
the frequencies in meditation?

00:18:44.220 --> 00:18:47.640 align:middle line:84%
You've got exactly the same
kind of frequencies showing up

00:18:47.640 --> 00:18:52.150 align:middle line:84%
that I was getting with the
orbs, quite fascinating.

00:18:52.150 --> 00:18:53.590 align:middle line:90%
And here's another one.

00:18:53.590 --> 00:18:56.860 align:middle line:84%
Before I play this, I want
to say that here you've

00:18:56.860 --> 00:18:58.480 align:middle line:90%
got more frequencies happening.

00:18:58.480 --> 00:19:03.910 align:middle line:84%
But although the lady in
the video didn't hear this,

00:19:03.910 --> 00:19:05.950 align:middle line:84%
there was something
coming through

00:19:05.950 --> 00:19:08.590 align:middle line:84%
that Valerie has no
idea where it came from.

00:19:08.590 --> 00:19:11.060 align:middle line:90%


00:19:11.060 --> 00:19:13.530 align:middle line:90%
[ELECTRICAL NOISES]

00:19:13.530 --> 00:19:28.870 align:middle line:90%


00:19:28.870 --> 00:19:31.810 align:middle line:84%
She has no idea
where that came from,

00:19:31.810 --> 00:19:33.970 align:middle line:90%
but we can see the frequencies.

00:19:33.970 --> 00:19:38.260 align:middle line:84%
They're actually being picked
up by the camera itself.

00:19:38.260 --> 00:19:40.390 align:middle line:84%
And that was,
again, in a session

00:19:40.390 --> 00:19:43.210 align:middle line:90%
of healing and meditation.

00:19:43.210 --> 00:19:46.030 align:middle line:84%
Now what I want to show you
here was another story that's

00:19:46.030 --> 00:19:48.705 align:middle line:90%
come up very, very recently.

00:19:48.705 --> 00:19:50.080 align:middle line:84%
And the reason I
want to show it,

00:19:50.080 --> 00:19:52.630 align:middle line:84%
because it's all about a
ball of light and contact

00:19:52.630 --> 00:19:55.130 align:middle line:90%
with this ball of light.

00:19:55.130 --> 00:19:59.190 align:middle line:84%
This gentleman is a
retired Captain, US Captain

00:19:59.190 --> 00:20:01.920 align:middle line:90%
in the army, retired pilot.

00:20:01.920 --> 00:20:03.670 align:middle line:84%
And he got in touch
with me because he

00:20:03.670 --> 00:20:07.030 align:middle line:84%
said he'd had an interaction
with a ball of light.

00:20:07.030 --> 00:20:10.420 align:middle line:84%
And from that time, his
pineal was activated.

00:20:10.420 --> 00:20:13.360 align:middle line:10%
And he now has all
these downloads

00:20:13.360 --> 00:20:17.800 align:middle line:10%
in terms of understanding from
the Akashic records, et cetera.

00:20:17.800 --> 00:20:23.500 align:middle line:84%
And I want to actually let you
hear him tell you how it was.

00:20:23.500 --> 00:20:26.600 align:middle line:84%
>> I can't describe the beauty
that was coming off of this.

00:20:26.600 --> 00:20:28.020 align:middle line:10%
I was like, what is that--

00:20:28.020 --> 00:20:29.950 align:middle line:10%
that blue light, right?

00:20:29.950 --> 00:20:32.800 align:middle line:84%
It was sitting nestled
in between two hills.

00:20:32.800 --> 00:20:34.720 align:middle line:84%
And Vanessa is the first
one that pointed out.

00:20:34.720 --> 00:20:36.610 align:middle line:90%
She was the first one to see it.

00:20:36.610 --> 00:20:39.170 align:middle line:90%
And I asked her--

00:20:39.170 --> 00:20:40.590 align:middle line:90%
it was a mountain exit.

00:20:40.590 --> 00:20:42.210 align:middle line:90%
It said 264.

00:20:42.210 --> 00:20:45.820 align:middle line:84%
And it actually backtracked
back to the blue light,

00:20:45.820 --> 00:20:48.420 align:middle line:90%
after we got off the interstate.

00:20:48.420 --> 00:20:52.630 align:middle line:84%
And as we passed
that blue light,

00:20:52.630 --> 00:20:54.970 align:middle line:84%
I heard something say--
and I was driving.

00:20:54.970 --> 00:20:58.850 align:middle line:84%
I heard something
say, here he comes.

00:20:58.850 --> 00:21:00.310 align:middle line:90%
I heard it plain as day, right?

00:21:00.310 --> 00:21:02.820 align:middle line:84%
Like telepathically,
here he comes.

00:21:02.820 --> 00:21:05.980 align:middle line:84%
And I turned to Vanessa and
I said, did you hear that?

00:21:05.980 --> 00:21:10.690 align:middle line:10%
And immediately after,
I can-- the best way

00:21:10.690 --> 00:21:14.605 align:middle line:10%
I can describe it is that we
went through like a time wave,

00:21:14.605 --> 00:21:15.940 align:middle line:10%
just like a wall.

00:21:15.940 --> 00:21:18.730 align:middle line:84%
And it slowed down,
a wormhole, yeah.

00:21:18.730 --> 00:21:20.934 align:middle line:90%
I was just a--

00:21:20.934 --> 00:21:23.780 align:middle line:84%
it took like a
microsecond of, you know,

00:21:23.780 --> 00:21:25.750 align:middle line:90%
and then back to normal.

00:21:25.750 --> 00:21:26.580 align:middle line:90%
And--

00:21:26.580 --> 00:21:28.080 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:21:28.080 --> 00:21:30.536 align:middle line:84%
>> But as we were driving
along, we got back to the house.

00:21:30.536 --> 00:21:33.860 align:middle line:84%
And I told Vanessa, I said,
Vanessa, you know we got back.

00:21:33.860 --> 00:21:36.693 align:middle line:90%
We were going to lay in bed.

00:21:36.693 --> 00:21:38.860 align:middle line:84%
And I said Vanessa, I think
that light did something

00:21:38.860 --> 00:21:41.032 align:middle line:90%
to me, right?

00:21:41.032 --> 00:21:42.220 align:middle line:90%
And sure enough--

00:21:42.220 --> 00:21:44.823 align:middle line:90%


00:21:44.823 --> 00:21:46.240 align:middle line:84%
I'm not trying to
be too dramatic.

00:21:46.240 --> 00:21:48.160 align:middle line:90%
I'm just dramatic.

00:21:48.160 --> 00:21:51.560 align:middle line:84%
I always tell the kids,
I'm a little dramatic--

00:21:51.560 --> 00:21:59.500 align:middle line:84%
But we got back and
a beam of blue light

00:21:59.500 --> 00:22:03.010 align:middle line:84%
in our bedroom, a beam of
light coming from space

00:22:03.010 --> 00:22:05.330 align:middle line:90%
shot into our bedroom.

00:22:05.330 --> 00:22:07.120 align:middle line:90%
And I looked over at Vanessa.

00:22:07.120 --> 00:22:08.950 align:middle line:90%
We'd just got in bed.

00:22:08.950 --> 00:22:11.560 align:middle line:90%
And I said, did you see that?

00:22:11.560 --> 00:22:12.940 align:middle line:90%
And she said, yes.

00:22:12.940 --> 00:22:15.460 align:middle line:84%
And as soon as she
said, yes, a second beam

00:22:15.460 --> 00:22:18.670 align:middle line:90%
came through from space.

00:22:18.670 --> 00:22:20.410 align:middle line:84%
We have a beautiful
view of heavens,

00:22:20.410 --> 00:22:23.360 align:middle line:84%
beautiful view of heavens in
here, nice big picture windows.

00:22:23.360 --> 00:22:25.880 align:middle line:84%
And it came-- and
it came through.

00:22:25.880 --> 00:22:31.690 align:middle line:84%
Then an orb of electromagnetic--
a ball, like a--

00:22:31.690 --> 00:22:32.540 align:middle line:90%
>> [INAUDIBLE]

00:22:32.540 --> 00:22:36.550 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, like an electromagnetic
orb, ball of lightning, right,

00:22:36.550 --> 00:22:41.710 align:middle line:84%
manifested in a corner
outside of our bedroom.

00:22:41.710 --> 00:22:45.050 align:middle line:90%
Then the wall disappeared.

00:22:45.050 --> 00:22:48.460 align:middle line:84%
And we could see this
ball of orb light.

00:22:48.460 --> 00:22:51.420 align:middle line:84%
You know, it was just an orb
of lightning just sitting,

00:22:51.420 --> 00:22:56.050 align:middle line:84%
like a star, right,
just like a star.

00:22:56.050 --> 00:22:58.160 align:middle line:90%
Excuse me.

00:22:58.160 --> 00:22:58.960 align:middle line:90%
>> I'm not--

00:22:58.960 --> 00:23:00.500 align:middle line:90%
>> That's crazy, right?

00:23:00.500 --> 00:23:07.240 align:middle line:84%
>> Full [INAUDIBLE] and you
saw this orb, this orb outside.

00:23:07.240 --> 00:23:08.150 align:middle line:90%
>> That's correct.

00:23:08.150 --> 00:23:08.950 align:middle line:90%
That's correct.

00:23:08.950 --> 00:23:11.260 align:middle line:84%
Through [INAUDIBLE] it
was just, it was just

00:23:11.260 --> 00:23:12.678 align:middle line:90%
an image, just a faded image.

00:23:12.678 --> 00:23:14.470 align:middle line:84%
It just faded out with
the light around it.

00:23:14.470 --> 00:23:17.360 align:middle line:90%
And yeah, it was just like a--

00:23:17.360 --> 00:23:18.360 align:middle line:90%
there was nothing there.

00:23:18.360 --> 00:23:21.115 align:middle line:84%
It was just [INAUDIBLE]
disappeared.

00:23:21.115 --> 00:23:21.915 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:23:21.915 --> 00:23:25.710 align:middle line:84%
>> Do you any-- do you feel that
anything else happened that--

00:23:25.710 --> 00:23:28.370 align:middle line:84%
did you have a missing time
episode or strange time

00:23:28.370 --> 00:23:29.170 align:middle line:90%
anomaly?

00:23:29.170 --> 00:23:33.950 align:middle line:10%
I-- I do and I don't know
how much time you have Mary.

00:23:33.950 --> 00:23:37.730 align:middle line:84%
There's a ton of little details
that happened since that event,

00:23:37.730 --> 00:23:38.530 align:middle line:90%
right.

00:23:38.530 --> 00:23:39.790 align:middle line:90%
And it's been ongoing.

00:23:39.790 --> 00:23:40.690 align:middle line:90%
It's been ongoing.

00:23:40.690 --> 00:23:41.810 align:middle line:90%
It has not stopped.

00:23:41.810 --> 00:23:42.610 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:23:42.610 --> 00:23:47.090 align:middle line:84%
>> Very important
point, but no it did--

00:23:47.090 --> 00:23:49.460 align:middle line:84%
actually, it telepathically
communicated with me.

00:23:49.460 --> 00:23:50.737 align:middle line:90%
I wrote it all down, right.

00:23:50.737 --> 00:23:51.570 align:middle line:90%
I wrote it all down.

00:23:51.570 --> 00:23:53.920 align:middle line:90%
I reported it to MUFON.

00:23:53.920 --> 00:23:56.580 align:middle line:84%
They came out, a
small investigation.

00:23:56.580 --> 00:23:57.380 align:middle line:90%
And--

00:23:57.380 --> 00:24:00.420 align:middle line:84%
>> They ruled our transformers
blowing up in the area.

00:24:00.420 --> 00:24:02.410 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, they ruled out
transformers blowing up

00:24:02.410 --> 00:24:06.400 align:middle line:84%
in the area with the blue
line, or anything electrical

00:24:06.400 --> 00:24:08.580 align:middle line:84%
in the city, or
anything like that.

00:24:08.580 --> 00:24:13.500 align:middle line:84%
But my goodness, you
know, I mean Mary,

00:24:13.500 --> 00:24:18.090 align:middle line:84%
just to keep it short, did you
see the book that I sent you,

00:24:18.090 --> 00:24:19.440 align:middle line:90%
the Perfect 10 Temple.

00:24:19.440 --> 00:24:20.240 align:middle line:90%
Did you see that?

00:24:20.240 --> 00:24:23.470 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, I want to
ask you about that.

00:24:23.470 --> 00:24:24.780 align:middle line:90%
>> Just--

00:24:24.780 --> 00:24:27.720 align:middle line:84%
>> I'm going to show you some
video in a minute of them with

00:24:27.720 --> 00:24:29.580 align:middle line:84%
the lights, the
orbs in the room.

00:24:29.580 --> 00:24:32.430 align:middle line:84%
And they can actually
see them physically.

00:24:32.430 --> 00:24:36.280 align:middle line:84%
But this is the point that
he was trying to make.

00:24:36.280 --> 00:24:38.610 align:middle line:84%
He said after this
experience, he

00:24:38.610 --> 00:24:41.970 align:middle line:84%
felt like someone had saturated
every molecule of his being

00:24:41.970 --> 00:24:45.210 align:middle line:90%
with absolute 100% pure love.

00:24:45.210 --> 00:24:46.890 align:middle line:90%
It opened my pineal completely.

00:24:46.890 --> 00:24:52.620 align:middle line:84%
And he said that, for him,
it was this pure, pure love

00:24:52.620 --> 00:24:54.510 align:middle line:84%
that he felt, as if I
could not hold any more

00:24:54.510 --> 00:24:57.360 align:middle line:84%
love within my vessel,
my body or mind,

00:24:57.360 --> 00:24:59.970 align:middle line:84%
absolute ecstasy,
nirvana, bliss.

00:24:59.970 --> 00:25:02.280 align:middle line:84%
None of these words
can do it justice.

00:25:02.280 --> 00:25:04.260 align:middle line:84%
Even to this day,
he said, I cry tears

00:25:04.260 --> 00:25:06.180 align:middle line:90%
of joy just thinking about it.

00:25:06.180 --> 00:25:09.180 align:middle line:84%
It told me that if I go to
the highest heavens, imagine.

00:25:09.180 --> 00:25:12.360 align:middle line:84%
It left me in a state of
residue where I am always

00:25:12.360 --> 00:25:14.520 align:middle line:84%
connected, where I
see light everywhere,

00:25:14.520 --> 00:25:17.910 align:middle line:84%
even with my eyes closed,
in a state of waking dream.

00:25:17.910 --> 00:25:19.530 align:middle line:84%
I suppose the best
way to explain

00:25:19.530 --> 00:25:21.900 align:middle line:84%
it is, to the common
man, is to say

00:25:21.900 --> 00:25:26.610 align:middle line:84%
imagine living with natural
DMT trip 24 hours a day, 60--

00:25:26.610 --> 00:25:28.930 align:middle line:90%
365 days a year.

00:25:28.930 --> 00:25:30.480 align:middle line:90%
So that was his activation.

00:25:30.480 --> 00:25:32.860 align:middle line:90%
And this was fairly recent.

00:25:32.860 --> 00:25:35.550 align:middle line:84%
But what is even more
interesting, in a minute,

00:25:35.550 --> 00:25:37.650 align:middle line:90%
I'll show you.

00:25:37.650 --> 00:25:41.880 align:middle line:84%
I got some images of
the orbs in his house.

00:25:41.880 --> 00:25:43.710 align:middle line:90%
And again, what did I see?

00:25:43.710 --> 00:25:46.350 align:middle line:84%
I started to see the
frequencies again.

00:25:46.350 --> 00:25:48.090 align:middle line:84%
And there they are in
those images there.

00:25:48.090 --> 00:25:51.210 align:middle line:90%


00:25:51.210 --> 00:25:54.300 align:middle line:84%
What is interesting also
is his understanding.

00:25:54.300 --> 00:25:56.790 align:middle line:90%
He said light is consciousness.

00:25:56.790 --> 00:25:58.800 align:middle line:90%
The world is a fractal of light.

00:25:58.800 --> 00:26:01.170 align:middle line:90%
DNA upgrades are via light.

00:26:01.170 --> 00:26:03.090 align:middle line:90%
I now know what Tesla knew.

00:26:03.090 --> 00:26:04.950 align:middle line:84%
Strange things have
continually occurred

00:26:04.950 --> 00:26:08.940 align:middle line:84%
since this event, such as lights
flickering, bells ringing,

00:26:08.940 --> 00:26:12.930 align:middle line:84%
a tornado of physical orbs
appearing in our home.

00:26:12.930 --> 00:26:15.310 align:middle line:84%
And I'll show you some
of that in a minute.

00:26:15.310 --> 00:26:17.490 align:middle line:84%
There you are, the light
poured into my mind.

00:26:17.490 --> 00:26:20.760 align:middle line:84%
I understood we have now
entered the Aquarian Age.

00:26:20.760 --> 00:26:23.670 align:middle line:84%
I understood Hindu cycles
of time are correct.

00:26:23.670 --> 00:26:25.590 align:middle line:84%
I understood God is
literally light and has

00:26:25.590 --> 00:26:28.200 align:middle line:84%
appeared in all cultures
throughout endless cycles

00:26:28.200 --> 00:26:29.040 align:middle line:90%
of time.

00:26:29.040 --> 00:26:32.100 align:middle line:84%
I understood the world is
eternal and has always existed.

00:26:32.100 --> 00:26:34.830 align:middle line:10%
I understood why all ancient
cultures worship the sun

00:26:34.830 --> 00:26:36.750 align:middle line:10%
and oriented their--

00:26:36.750 --> 00:26:39.090 align:middle line:10%
their temple
complexes with Orion.

00:26:39.090 --> 00:26:40.740 align:middle line:84%
I understood what
we see on Earth

00:26:40.740 --> 00:26:44.420 align:middle line:84%
is the remnants of
countless cycles.

00:26:44.420 --> 00:26:47.460 align:middle line:84%
The blue orb contact, Jimmy
spoke of it and asked,

00:26:47.460 --> 00:26:48.930 align:middle line:90%
are you all light?

00:26:48.930 --> 00:26:51.970 align:middle line:90%
And the blue orb said, yes.

00:26:51.970 --> 00:26:55.150 align:middle line:84%
But 15 minutes later,
guess what happened?

00:26:55.150 --> 00:26:57.040 align:middle line:84%
After the telepathic
conversation

00:26:57.040 --> 00:27:00.010 align:middle line:84%
with the blue light, within
the minute after it happened,

00:27:00.010 --> 00:27:05.720 align:middle line:84%
two Black Hawk helicopters
appeared, totally blacked out.

00:27:05.720 --> 00:27:08.500 align:middle line:84%
I identified them by
their rotor wash sound,

00:27:08.500 --> 00:27:09.850 align:middle line:90%
as that is distinct--

00:27:09.850 --> 00:27:11.050 align:middle line:90%
distinctive.

00:27:11.050 --> 00:27:13.330 align:middle line:84%
And they stayed for
about 10 minutes.

00:27:13.330 --> 00:27:15.950 align:middle line:84%
Because he was a pilot,
he could identify them.

00:27:15.950 --> 00:27:18.430 align:middle line:84%
And so many have
had contact notice

00:27:18.430 --> 00:27:20.530 align:middle line:84%
within a few minutes
of their contact,

00:27:20.530 --> 00:27:21.970 align:middle line:84%
you'll see the
black helicopters.

00:27:21.970 --> 00:27:26.610 align:middle line:90%


00:27:26.610 --> 00:27:30.810 align:middle line:84%
>> But after that,
it disappeared.

00:27:30.810 --> 00:27:33.320 align:middle line:84%
So we had a chance,
after it disappeared,

00:27:33.320 --> 00:27:34.655 align:middle line:90%
and then the helicopters came.

00:27:34.655 --> 00:27:36.363 align:middle line:84%
Did you hear about
the black helicopters?

00:27:36.363 --> 00:27:37.163 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:27:37.163 --> 00:27:38.320 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, we know.

00:27:38.320 --> 00:27:39.920 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, yeah.

00:27:39.920 --> 00:27:40.970 align:middle line:90%
Oh, yeah.

00:27:40.970 --> 00:27:44.700 align:middle line:84%
So the black heli, so the
black helicopters came, right?

00:27:44.700 --> 00:27:45.500 align:middle line:90%
So that's.

00:27:45.500 --> 00:27:45.870 align:middle line:90%
>> That had to be horrifying.

00:27:45.870 --> 00:27:46.370 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:27:46.370 --> 00:27:47.315 align:middle line:90%
Now interestingly

00:27:47.315 --> 00:27:48.450 align:middle line:90%
>> Blackhawks.

00:27:48.450 --> 00:27:49.250 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:27:49.250 --> 00:27:53.630 align:middle line:84%
I'm a retired Blackhawk
pilot, military pilot, right.

00:27:53.630 --> 00:27:56.520 align:middle line:84%
So I know exactly what
it is when it came over.

00:27:56.520 --> 00:27:58.920 align:middle line:90%
I knew exactly what it was.

00:27:58.920 --> 00:28:02.000 align:middle line:84%
And it's a, it's what we called
an ARF, an ARF, Aerial Reaction

00:28:02.000 --> 00:28:03.330 align:middle line:90%
Force.

00:28:03.330 --> 00:28:07.906 align:middle line:84%
So there was two Blackhawk
helicopters [INAUDIBLE]

00:28:07.906 --> 00:28:11.270 align:middle line:84%
right over our home and
totally blacked out.

00:28:11.270 --> 00:28:14.120 align:middle line:84%
So hit the [INAUDIBLE]
panel switch.

00:28:14.120 --> 00:28:16.040 align:middle line:90%
>> So there you are.

00:28:16.040 --> 00:28:19.880 align:middle line:84%
This is very common with many of
those that are having contact.

00:28:19.880 --> 00:28:21.890 align:middle line:84%
Eventually, it
seems the military

00:28:21.890 --> 00:28:24.560 align:middle line:84%
get to know where
they're about to appear,

00:28:24.560 --> 00:28:27.200 align:middle line:84%
because a lot of those
that have contact

00:28:27.200 --> 00:28:33.060 align:middle line:84%
are actually pulling them in
and the military know about it.

00:28:33.060 --> 00:28:34.060 align:middle line:90%
So what's else going on?

00:28:34.060 --> 00:28:35.780 align:middle line:84%
I think this one
is to just show you

00:28:35.780 --> 00:28:38.780 align:middle line:84%
something very interesting
that was sent to me by Jimmy

00:28:38.780 --> 00:28:40.280 align:middle line:90%
just recently.

00:28:40.280 --> 00:28:42.710 align:middle line:84%
I want you to notice all
the orbs flying around.

00:28:42.710 --> 00:28:45.015 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, my god.

00:28:45.015 --> 00:28:46.410 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, my god.

00:28:46.410 --> 00:28:48.192 align:middle line:90%
Look at the [INAUDIBLE].

00:28:48.192 --> 00:28:52.050 align:middle line:90%


00:28:52.050 --> 00:28:54.630 align:middle line:84%
Turning around in my house to
see where they're coming from.

00:28:54.630 --> 00:29:00.120 align:middle line:90%


00:29:00.120 --> 00:29:00.990 align:middle line:90%
>> Green, blue.

00:29:00.990 --> 00:29:05.090 align:middle line:90%


00:29:05.090 --> 00:29:08.124 align:middle line:90%
>> Jackson.

00:29:08.124 --> 00:29:10.038 align:middle line:84%
That one's coming right
over the fireplace.

00:29:10.038 --> 00:29:12.730 align:middle line:90%


00:29:12.730 --> 00:29:15.020 align:middle line:84%
>> And they can see
them physically.

00:29:15.020 --> 00:29:18.700 align:middle line:84%
This wasn't just
through the camera.

00:29:18.700 --> 00:29:21.317 align:middle line:90%
The dog's having a good time.

00:29:21.317 --> 00:29:23.400 align:middle line:84%
>> Stand back and see if
they're coming out of me.

00:29:23.400 --> 00:29:24.040 align:middle line:90%
>> No, they're not.

00:29:24.040 --> 00:29:24.840 align:middle line:90%
>> No?

00:29:24.840 --> 00:29:25.900 align:middle line:90%
They're around us though.

00:29:25.900 --> 00:29:27.025 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, they're around us.

00:29:27.025 --> 00:29:29.610 align:middle line:90%


00:29:29.610 --> 00:29:31.620 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, I'm seeing [INAUDIBLE].

00:29:31.620 --> 00:29:33.270 align:middle line:90%
>> They're still here.

00:29:33.270 --> 00:29:34.320 align:middle line:90%
They're all over.

00:29:34.320 --> 00:29:35.120 align:middle line:90%
>> Where?

00:29:35.120 --> 00:29:38.570 align:middle line:90%
Look at that right here.

00:29:38.570 --> 00:29:40.070 align:middle line:84%
>> Because the
animals can see them.

00:29:40.070 --> 00:29:41.100 align:middle line:90%
>> A little bit.

00:29:41.100 --> 00:29:41.540 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:29:41.540 --> 00:29:42.750 align:middle line:84%
>> They're coming
through the window.

00:29:42.750 --> 00:29:44.583 align:middle line:84%
It's like they're coming
through the window.

00:29:44.583 --> 00:29:46.440 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, cool.

00:29:46.440 --> 00:29:49.140 align:middle line:84%
Well, good energy,
welcome to the home.

00:29:49.140 --> 00:29:53.060 align:middle line:84%
Positive, loving
vibrational energies.

00:29:53.060 --> 00:29:54.660 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

00:29:54.660 --> 00:29:57.540 align:middle line:84%
>> It's very important you see
individuals that have these.

00:29:57.540 --> 00:29:59.340 align:middle line:84%
>> I mean, these are
not dust mites, Jimmy.

00:29:59.340 --> 00:30:00.260 align:middle line:90%
>> No, no.

00:30:00.260 --> 00:30:00.570 align:middle line:90%
That's energy.

00:30:00.570 --> 00:30:01.140 align:middle line:90%
>> There's all the questioning.

00:30:01.140 --> 00:30:01.470 align:middle line:90%
>> That's energy.

00:30:01.470 --> 00:30:02.310 align:middle line:90%
>> That's going on.

00:30:02.310 --> 00:30:03.783 align:middle line:90%
>> That's energy, [INAUDIBLE].

00:30:03.783 --> 00:30:04.765 align:middle line:90%
It is.

00:30:04.765 --> 00:30:06.240 align:middle line:90%
You can see.

00:30:06.240 --> 00:30:08.882 align:middle line:90%
>> Here, look straight up.

00:30:08.882 --> 00:30:09.870 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:30:09.870 --> 00:30:12.834 align:middle line:90%


00:30:12.834 --> 00:30:14.925 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:30:14.925 --> 00:30:16.050 align:middle line:90%
>> I mean, there's no bugs.

00:30:16.050 --> 00:30:17.220 align:middle line:90%
>> No, there's nothing.

00:30:17.220 --> 00:30:18.020 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh.

00:30:18.020 --> 00:30:18.895 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, it's energy.

00:30:18.895 --> 00:30:21.940 align:middle line:90%


00:30:21.940 --> 00:30:24.840 align:middle line:84%
>> OK, now I want to
show you something else.

00:30:24.840 --> 00:30:26.910 align:middle line:84%
Because I got intrigued
about all the orbs

00:30:26.910 --> 00:30:32.010 align:middle line:84%
and I actually slowed this
one down like I did before,

00:30:32.010 --> 00:30:35.580 align:middle line:84%
I managed to find something
that Jimmy hadn't seen.

00:30:35.580 --> 00:30:38.170 align:middle line:84%
I wonder if you can see
it outside the window.

00:30:38.170 --> 00:30:43.280 align:middle line:90%


00:30:43.280 --> 00:30:44.672 align:middle line:90%
Can you see?

00:30:44.672 --> 00:30:46.400 align:middle line:84%
Can you see what's
outside the window?

00:30:46.400 --> 00:30:49.580 align:middle line:90%


00:30:49.580 --> 00:30:53.207 align:middle line:84%
Looks suspiciously like a
little being, doesn't it?

00:30:53.207 --> 00:30:54.040 align:middle line:90%
Wouldn't you reckon?

00:30:54.040 --> 00:30:56.650 align:middle line:90%


00:30:56.650 --> 00:30:58.650 align:middle line:84%
So I think there was
more than the orbs

00:30:58.650 --> 00:31:01.590 align:middle line:84%
going on in that
particular time.

00:31:01.590 --> 00:31:03.000 align:middle line:90%
And this is what I mean.

00:31:03.000 --> 00:31:04.200 align:middle line:90%
It's all so fast.

00:31:04.200 --> 00:31:06.750 align:middle line:84%
Our eyes can't see
what's actually going on.

00:31:06.750 --> 00:31:08.790 align:middle line:84%
But luckily now
we have technology

00:31:08.790 --> 00:31:11.490 align:middle line:84%
that's giving us a
real clue onto more

00:31:11.490 --> 00:31:14.868 align:middle line:84%
of the non-physical realms,
and more that's going on.

00:31:14.868 --> 00:31:16.410 align:middle line:84%
And that's what I
wanted to show you.

00:31:16.410 --> 00:31:21.300 align:middle line:84%
There is more going on than we
realize when contact happens.

00:31:21.300 --> 00:31:24.910 align:middle line:84%
And this is an interesting
story about the orbs as well.

00:31:24.910 --> 00:31:29.270 align:middle line:84%
And this was by a wonderful
gentleman, Jim Schaefer,

00:31:29.270 --> 00:31:31.020 align:middle line:90%
who sent me the video.

00:31:31.020 --> 00:31:34.140 align:middle line:10%
And in the video you can see
this orb literally going from,

00:31:34.140 --> 00:31:36.430 align:middle line:10%
he was resting
watching television,

00:31:36.430 --> 00:31:38.880 align:middle line:10%
but he was running his camera.

00:31:38.880 --> 00:31:43.020 align:middle line:10%
And this particular
light, he filmed

00:31:43.020 --> 00:31:45.930 align:middle line:10%
it going from the
side of the room up

00:31:45.930 --> 00:31:47.100 align:middle line:10%
and it entered his body.

00:31:47.100 --> 00:31:50.550 align:middle line:84%
Now he had been talking to
the being, saying he had,

00:31:50.550 --> 00:31:52.650 align:middle line:90%
he'd found he had cancer.

00:31:52.650 --> 00:31:55.800 align:middle line:10%
And he said to the beings,
please, can you heal me?

00:31:55.800 --> 00:31:58.350 align:middle line:10%
And this is what
he actually said.

00:31:58.350 --> 00:32:00.930 align:middle line:10%
He asked for help, as his
tumor had grown rapidly.

00:32:00.930 --> 00:32:02.850 align:middle line:10%
"I was in bed watching TV.

00:32:02.850 --> 00:32:06.270 align:middle line:10%
I used my cell phone for
the filming for activity.

00:32:06.270 --> 00:32:08.280 align:middle line:10%
I hit the Record
and a whiteboard orb

00:32:08.280 --> 00:32:10.380 align:middle line:10%
fell down from the
strip of the wall

00:32:10.380 --> 00:32:13.320 align:middle line:10%
and it turned into a blue
mass and came towards me.

00:32:13.320 --> 00:32:16.420 align:middle line:84%
It turns in on itself
and dives into my body.

00:32:16.420 --> 00:32:19.650 align:middle line:10%
I was so shocked, I didn't sleep
until the following morning.

00:32:19.650 --> 00:32:23.310 align:middle line:10%
Then I woke up later
and noticed immediately

00:32:23.310 --> 00:32:28.290 align:middle line:10%
the tumor was completely
gone in an 18-hour time span.

00:32:28.290 --> 00:32:30.360 align:middle line:10%
I had surgery to remove
the four lymph nodes that

00:32:30.360 --> 00:32:32.410 align:middle line:10%
had necrosis, and two
days later, found out

00:32:32.410 --> 00:32:34.020 align:middle line:10%
I didn't have cancer.

00:32:34.020 --> 00:32:37.590 align:middle line:10%
I believe, he said, they
wanted me to witness and record

00:32:37.590 --> 00:32:38.400 align:middle line:10%
this event.

00:32:38.400 --> 00:32:39.660 align:middle line:10%
I don't know why I was healed.

00:32:39.660 --> 00:32:42.150 align:middle line:10%
Maybe it's because I
had unusual genetics,

00:32:42.150 --> 00:32:43.980 align:middle line:10%
because I'm Rh O negative.

00:32:43.980 --> 00:32:45.360 align:middle line:10%
I've been changed.

00:32:45.360 --> 00:32:47.160 align:middle line:10%
I'm very empathic
towards animals

00:32:47.160 --> 00:32:49.870 align:middle line:10%
and caring about the
state of the planet."

00:32:49.870 --> 00:32:53.520 align:middle line:10%
So this is a healing
done by one of the orbs.

00:32:53.520 --> 00:32:56.730 align:middle line:10%
And I slowed up his footage.

00:32:56.730 --> 00:32:58.860 align:middle line:10%
And there you see
the frequencies.

00:32:58.860 --> 00:33:00.630 align:middle line:10%
As I slowed the
footage up that is

00:33:00.630 --> 00:33:06.220 align:middle line:10%
coming towards him to the bed,
there you see the frequencies.

00:33:06.220 --> 00:33:09.300 align:middle line:10%
So again, more evidence
that something's going on.

00:33:09.300 --> 00:33:11.550 align:middle line:10%
And this, I won't show
you the video of it,

00:33:11.550 --> 00:33:16.710 align:middle line:10%
because I've got so much to show
you, but through the camera in,

00:33:16.710 --> 00:33:19.650 align:middle line:10%
this was in place in England
where they were watching

00:33:19.650 --> 00:33:21.880 align:middle line:10%
the child who was sick.

00:33:21.880 --> 00:33:24.210 align:middle line:84%
And because of that, they
were watching the monitor.

00:33:24.210 --> 00:33:27.810 align:middle line:84%
And on the monitor was this
orb that was around the child

00:33:27.810 --> 00:33:28.800 align:middle line:90%
all night.

00:33:28.800 --> 00:33:31.050 align:middle line:84%
And they said that,
Chloe and Tom said

00:33:31.050 --> 00:33:32.660 align:middle line:90%
their baby was ill with croup.

00:33:32.660 --> 00:33:35.480 align:middle line:84%
So they wandered and they
kept watch by monitoring.

00:33:35.480 --> 00:33:38.470 align:middle line:84%
A bright orb, a light orb
was filmed on the monitor

00:33:38.470 --> 00:33:39.270 align:middle line:90%
all night.

00:33:39.270 --> 00:33:41.760 align:middle line:84%
They had never seen
this before or since.

00:33:41.760 --> 00:33:44.910 align:middle line:84%
The baby was sick, but the
next day it was better.

00:33:44.910 --> 00:33:46.560 align:middle line:84%
So we're getting
evidence that there's

00:33:46.560 --> 00:33:49.230 align:middle line:90%
more again, going on here.

00:33:49.230 --> 00:33:51.480 align:middle line:84%
And this is another
kind of contact

00:33:51.480 --> 00:33:54.030 align:middle line:84%
that I want to
speak to you about.

00:33:54.030 --> 00:33:58.890 align:middle line:84%
And this is a little
boy of 11, Matthew.

00:33:58.890 --> 00:34:02.070 align:middle line:84%
And this is the being that
took him on board craft.

00:34:02.070 --> 00:34:04.050 align:middle line:84%
Now this is where
I want to say, not

00:34:04.050 --> 00:34:05.730 align:middle line:84%
only is healing done
with these orbs,

00:34:05.730 --> 00:34:09.179 align:middle line:84%
but I also wonder what
the frequencies are doing.

00:34:09.179 --> 00:34:11.190 align:middle line:84%
Matthew was sleeping
when this being came.

00:34:11.190 --> 00:34:12.480 align:middle line:90%
They seem to be good, he said.

00:34:12.480 --> 00:34:15.179 align:middle line:84%
Short, light gray,
big heads, small slit

00:34:15.179 --> 00:34:17.130 align:middle line:90%
for a mouth and big black eyes.

00:34:17.130 --> 00:34:20.219 align:middle line:84%
I was lifted up to the ceiling
and blacked out, he said.

00:34:20.219 --> 00:34:25.050 align:middle line:84%
I woke in a dome-shaped ship to
see the beings around a control

00:34:25.050 --> 00:34:27.900 align:middle line:84%
panel type desk where
they're communicating

00:34:27.900 --> 00:34:30.210 align:middle line:84%
in another language
telepathically, which

00:34:30.210 --> 00:34:31.560 align:middle line:90%
I could hear.

00:34:31.560 --> 00:34:33.840 align:middle line:84%
I focused on the
control panel, hearing

00:34:33.840 --> 00:34:38.130 align:middle line:84%
sounds which I felt
were altering my DNA.

00:34:38.130 --> 00:34:41.100 align:middle line:10%
Afterwards, this
became the first second

00:34:41.100 --> 00:34:44.280 align:middle line:10%
of five songs called
decoding the human DNA.

00:34:44.280 --> 00:34:46.050 align:middle line:10%
The first of the
second five songs

00:34:46.050 --> 00:34:49.060 align:middle line:10%
completed within
three day's arrival.

00:34:49.060 --> 00:34:51.120 align:middle line:10%
Now, in my next
presentation, I'm

00:34:51.120 --> 00:34:54.300 align:middle line:10%
going to play some
of the songs that he

00:34:54.300 --> 00:34:56.739 align:middle line:10%
played after his experience.

00:34:56.739 --> 00:35:00.240 align:middle line:84%
And one of them is
called "Decoding DNA."

00:35:00.240 --> 00:35:03.690 align:middle line:84%
So that's bringing
in the frequencies.

00:35:03.690 --> 00:35:07.020 align:middle line:84%
Dr. Lena Ohlson, who I've
resourced in many ways,

00:35:07.020 --> 00:35:10.980 align:middle line:84%
a molecular biologist, who is
also an experiencer and lives

00:35:10.980 --> 00:35:12.420 align:middle line:90%
in Sweden.

00:35:12.420 --> 00:35:16.020 align:middle line:84%
She does lots of
healing with crystals.

00:35:16.020 --> 00:35:18.600 align:middle line:10%
But she's also, as I
say, an experiencer,

00:35:18.600 --> 00:35:21.690 align:middle line:10%
and she says that the new
children that are coming in,

00:35:21.690 --> 00:35:25.980 align:middle line:10%
the new generations
that are considered, she

00:35:25.980 --> 00:35:27.960 align:middle line:10%
calls them letter people.

00:35:27.960 --> 00:35:32.160 align:middle line:10%
And we're meaning ADHD,
dyslexia, Asperger's,

00:35:32.160 --> 00:35:34.650 align:middle line:10%
and some forms of autism.

00:35:34.650 --> 00:35:38.040 align:middle line:10%
She said that these are,
as far as she's concerned,

00:35:38.040 --> 00:35:40.260 align:middle line:10%
some of the new upgrades.

00:35:40.260 --> 00:35:43.710 align:middle line:10%
And this is what she got
from her own connection

00:35:43.710 --> 00:35:46.740 align:middle line:10%
to not only Mantas,
but many other beings.

00:35:46.740 --> 00:35:48.840 align:middle line:10%
The information of the
donors and their background

00:35:48.840 --> 00:35:52.020 align:middle line:10%
is there a hidden key,
and like PC programmers,

00:35:52.020 --> 00:35:53.430 align:middle line:10%
hide their work.

00:35:53.430 --> 00:35:54.800 align:middle line:10%
This key can be activated.

00:35:54.800 --> 00:35:57.000 align:middle line:10%
The programmers
know when the person

00:35:57.000 --> 00:35:58.680 align:middle line:10%
is ready to be contacted.

00:35:58.680 --> 00:36:01.590 align:middle line:10%
The activated ones spread a
signal to wake the others up.

00:36:01.590 --> 00:36:03.330 align:middle line:90%
I feel they're speeding this up.

00:36:03.330 --> 00:36:06.570 align:middle line:84%
And this is what I
believe is happening too.

00:36:06.570 --> 00:36:09.840 align:middle line:84%
Another molecular biologist,
Dr. William Brown,

00:36:09.840 --> 00:36:12.090 align:middle line:90%
wrote to me many years ago now.

00:36:12.090 --> 00:36:14.640 align:middle line:84%
And this is his understanding
of the new human.

00:36:14.640 --> 00:36:17.790 align:middle line:84%
I believe genetic modification
is occurring right now in utero

00:36:17.790 --> 00:36:19.590 align:middle line:90%
and producing new humans.

00:36:19.590 --> 00:36:22.680 align:middle line:84%
The exponential increase
in autistic, ADD and Indigo

00:36:22.680 --> 00:36:25.703 align:middle line:84%
children have new
genetic architecture,

00:36:25.703 --> 00:36:27.120 align:middle line:84%
which allows them
to see the world

00:36:27.120 --> 00:36:29.370 align:middle line:90%
in a multi-dimensional fashion.

00:36:29.370 --> 00:36:32.100 align:middle line:84%
I believe research would show
dormant genetic regions are

00:36:32.100 --> 00:36:35.820 align:middle line:84%
being reintegrated into the
biological systems occurring

00:36:35.820 --> 00:36:39.090 align:middle line:84%
in all of us to produce
expanded awareness.

00:36:39.090 --> 00:36:40.390 align:middle line:90%
Their brains work faster.

00:36:40.390 --> 00:36:42.720 align:middle line:84%
They have access to more
information in the beginning.

00:36:42.720 --> 00:36:45.720 align:middle line:84%
In the classroom, learning
is much faster than normal.

00:36:45.720 --> 00:36:48.900 align:middle line:84%
I believe they already
know what is being taught.

00:36:48.900 --> 00:36:52.080 align:middle line:84%
Very important
with the new ones.

00:36:52.080 --> 00:36:54.240 align:middle line:10%
Dormant genetic regions
are being integrated

00:36:54.240 --> 00:36:55.740 align:middle line:10%
into the biological system.

00:36:55.740 --> 00:36:58.800 align:middle line:84%
Information is encoded within
the atomic structure of the DNA

00:36:58.800 --> 00:36:59.760 align:middle line:90%
molecule.

00:36:59.760 --> 00:37:01.800 align:middle line:84%
It's more like
remodeling of the genome

00:37:01.800 --> 00:37:04.140 align:middle line:84%
to make dormant
regions accessible.

00:37:04.140 --> 00:37:06.520 align:middle line:84%
Vast amounts of information
and functional capacity

00:37:06.520 --> 00:37:08.100 align:middle line:90%
is already there.

00:37:08.100 --> 00:37:11.130 align:middle line:84%
Vast capacity of the DNA
to store information.

00:37:11.130 --> 00:37:16.080 align:middle line:84%
In one gram of DNA,
I have read, that can

00:37:16.080 --> 00:37:18.600 align:middle line:84%
store everything that's
on the internet now

00:37:18.600 --> 00:37:21.430 align:middle line:90%
in one gram of DNA.

00:37:21.430 --> 00:37:23.750 align:middle line:84%
So what have we got
encoded into our DNA?

00:37:23.750 --> 00:37:26.500 align:middle line:90%


00:37:26.500 --> 00:37:28.230 align:middle line:90%
So ADHD.

00:37:28.230 --> 00:37:30.540 align:middle line:84%
This is a lovely explanation
from a gentleman that

00:37:30.540 --> 00:37:36.740 align:middle line:84%
only realized in his 50s that he
would be diagnosed now as ADHD.

00:37:36.740 --> 00:37:41.400 align:middle line:84%
And he wrote the book, "Close
Encounters of the ADHD Kind."

00:37:41.400 --> 00:37:44.250 align:middle line:10%
"My book is about what happened
in my extra dimensional world,

00:37:44.250 --> 00:37:46.170 align:middle line:10%
where I met the beings of light.

00:37:46.170 --> 00:37:48.810 align:middle line:10%
Being symptomatic
of ADHD, I am not

00:37:48.810 --> 00:37:51.920 align:middle line:10%
limited to the square
template of the universe.

00:37:51.920 --> 00:37:54.240 align:middle line:10%
I am wired to the
multi-dimensional universe.

00:37:54.240 --> 00:37:56.540 align:middle line:10%
My internet browser
can browse into chaos,

00:37:56.540 --> 00:37:59.040 align:middle line:10%
be it on Earth or
the multiverse.

00:37:59.040 --> 00:38:02.550 align:middle line:10%
I can perceive hidden layers of
order and make sense of it all.

00:38:02.550 --> 00:38:05.070 align:middle line:10%
Most folk, without a
supercharged browser,

00:38:05.070 --> 00:38:06.220 align:middle line:10%
cannot do this.

00:38:06.220 --> 00:38:09.480 align:middle line:10%
They are focused towards
convention in this reality.

00:38:09.480 --> 00:38:15.420 align:middle line:10%
And he has re-translated
the ADHD into.

00:38:15.420 --> 00:38:18.420 align:middle line:10%
always dialed Into
higher dimensions.

00:38:18.420 --> 00:38:22.120 align:middle line:10%
Because that's
the new children."

00:38:22.120 --> 00:38:23.290 align:middle line:90%
The new human.

00:38:23.290 --> 00:38:26.110 align:middle line:90%
So why do I say that?

00:38:26.110 --> 00:38:30.460 align:middle line:84%
I asked a young man
who was then 16,

00:38:30.460 --> 00:38:33.970 align:middle line:84%
who blew me away with his
understanding of reality

00:38:33.970 --> 00:38:35.840 align:middle line:90%
and who he was.

00:38:35.840 --> 00:38:40.000 align:middle line:84%
And I asked him about what
he knew about the new human.

00:38:40.000 --> 00:38:41.650 align:middle line:84%
I like the term the
new human, he said.

00:38:41.650 --> 00:38:43.733 align:middle line:84%
The title fits, because
we're going into something

00:38:43.733 --> 00:38:44.950 align:middle line:90%
that is new for us.

00:38:44.950 --> 00:38:47.740 align:middle line:84%
The labels, such as crystal
child, Indigo child and rainbow

00:38:47.740 --> 00:38:49.990 align:middle line:84%
child is not
describing the person,

00:38:49.990 --> 00:38:52.540 align:middle line:84%
but the person's
expression of self.

00:38:52.540 --> 00:38:55.090 align:middle line:84%
The Indigo child has
the warrior personality

00:38:55.090 --> 00:38:58.300 align:middle line:84%
to break down a system that's
wrong and needs to change.

00:38:58.300 --> 00:39:00.460 align:middle line:84%
Crystalline child has the
aura of love and peace,

00:39:00.460 --> 00:39:04.030 align:middle line:84%
the healer, the medium
bringing in the sight.

00:39:04.030 --> 00:39:06.580 align:middle line:84%
The rainbow child has the
energy of the creator, leader,

00:39:06.580 --> 00:39:08.360 align:middle line:90%
kingship personality.

00:39:08.360 --> 00:39:10.450 align:middle line:90%
It's a vibrational difference.

00:39:10.450 --> 00:39:12.670 align:middle line:84%
It's a term humans
are using only because

00:39:12.670 --> 00:39:14.470 align:middle line:90%
of limited understanding.

00:39:14.470 --> 00:39:16.060 align:middle line:10%
Those who call
themselves these labels

00:39:16.060 --> 00:39:19.480 align:middle line:10%
are just resonating to the
frequency of those attributes

00:39:19.480 --> 00:39:21.940 align:middle line:10%
and not staying
with the status quo.

00:39:21.940 --> 00:39:24.880 align:middle line:10%
Animals are changing
too, personality-wise.

00:39:24.880 --> 00:39:26.960 align:middle line:10%
Animals are evolving.

00:39:26.960 --> 00:39:31.600 align:middle line:10%
And this is his understanding
at 16 years old.

00:39:31.600 --> 00:39:35.490 align:middle line:90%
A lady wrote to me from Sweden.

00:39:35.490 --> 00:39:37.860 align:middle line:90%
And she said this.

00:39:37.860 --> 00:39:39.600 align:middle line:84%
"In my first pregnancy,
a voice told me

00:39:39.600 --> 00:39:40.950 align:middle line:90%
that my children are not mine.

00:39:40.950 --> 00:39:42.450 align:middle line:90%
They belong to no one.

00:39:42.450 --> 00:39:45.060 align:middle line:84%
My daughter gets important
messages in ET languages.

00:39:45.060 --> 00:39:48.480 align:middle line:10%
I showed her your presentation,
and when the lady did healing

00:39:48.480 --> 00:39:50.790 align:middle line:10%
and writes in ET
languages, she responded

00:39:50.790 --> 00:39:52.680 align:middle line:10%
in joy and excitement.

00:39:52.680 --> 00:39:55.890 align:middle line:10%
She knows what I have
written, she said.

00:39:55.890 --> 00:39:57.990 align:middle line:10%
My daughter has helpers
who guide and teach her.

00:39:57.990 --> 00:40:01.740 align:middle line:10%
They're here to help
humanity with the awakening.

00:40:01.740 --> 00:40:04.890 align:middle line:10%
And this little
girl I call Cathy

00:40:04.890 --> 00:40:08.870 align:middle line:10%
said, my guides have no hair or
ears, human eyes, but bigger.

00:40:08.870 --> 00:40:10.170 align:middle line:10%
The green being is male.

00:40:10.170 --> 00:40:11.550 align:middle line:10%
Emoke is blue.

00:40:11.550 --> 00:40:13.570 align:middle line:10%
My friends are
here all the time.

00:40:13.570 --> 00:40:15.330 align:middle line:10%
It's dangerous to
come and help here,

00:40:15.330 --> 00:40:17.580 align:middle line:10%
because memories can
be deleted at birth

00:40:17.580 --> 00:40:19.920 align:middle line:10%
by education and drugs.

00:40:19.920 --> 00:40:22.020 align:middle line:10%
My 9-year-old daughter
has healing abilities

00:40:22.020 --> 00:40:27.720 align:middle line:10%
and speaks healing words in
ET languages to purify water.

00:40:27.720 --> 00:40:29.830 align:middle line:10%
It tasted different after this.

00:40:29.830 --> 00:40:33.340 align:middle line:10%
She says the languages are from
a place outside the universe."

00:40:33.340 --> 00:40:36.100 align:middle line:10%
>> [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

00:40:36.100 --> 00:40:37.260 align:middle line:10%
>> This is her speaking.

00:40:37.260 --> 00:40:41.922 align:middle line:10%
>> [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

00:40:41.922 --> 00:41:07.030 align:middle line:90%


00:41:07.030 --> 00:41:08.040 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:41:08.040 --> 00:41:13.310 align:middle line:84%
Also, Cathy was
given seven books.

00:41:13.310 --> 00:41:14.580 align:middle line:90%
She said this.

00:41:14.580 --> 00:41:16.320 align:middle line:90%
"I was given these seven books.

00:41:16.320 --> 00:41:17.980 align:middle line:90%
They're not real books.

00:41:17.980 --> 00:41:21.620 align:middle line:84%
But she said, this is what
these seven books were.

00:41:21.620 --> 00:41:24.080 align:middle line:84%
The red book is about
creation and its origins.

00:41:24.080 --> 00:41:27.830 align:middle line:84%
The brown one is about different
planets and the life there.

00:41:27.830 --> 00:41:29.360 align:middle line:84%
The light green
one is about nature

00:41:29.360 --> 00:41:31.490 align:middle line:84%
and how we can make contact
with plants and animals

00:41:31.490 --> 00:41:33.080 align:middle line:90%
and understand nature.

00:41:33.080 --> 00:41:35.750 align:middle line:84%
The dark green one is about the
body and how it really works

00:41:35.750 --> 00:41:37.520 align:middle line:90%
and how we get to evolve.

00:41:37.520 --> 00:41:39.500 align:middle line:84%
The blue book is
about light and truth.

00:41:39.500 --> 00:41:41.060 align:middle line:84%
And the red book,
she can't open yet,

00:41:41.060 --> 00:41:45.020 align:middle line:84%
because a dragon took the
key from her in the 1700s.

00:41:45.020 --> 00:41:48.510 align:middle line:84%
The black book is about
darkness and evil."

00:41:48.510 --> 00:41:50.040 align:middle line:84%
What's so interesting
is, that we've

00:41:50.040 --> 00:41:53.580 align:middle line:84%
got a nine-year-old
explaining the understanding

00:41:53.580 --> 00:41:57.110 align:middle line:84%
of this information
that she's been given.

00:41:57.110 --> 00:41:58.370 align:middle line:90%
So how do they know?

00:41:58.370 --> 00:41:59.570 align:middle line:90%
How do the children know?

00:41:59.570 --> 00:42:01.830 align:middle line:90%
How do the adults have contact?

00:42:01.830 --> 00:42:03.650 align:middle line:84%
Just like you heard
with Jimmy, Jimmy

00:42:03.650 --> 00:42:07.680 align:middle line:84%
had an activation from
this ball of light.

00:42:07.680 --> 00:42:09.740 align:middle line:84%
You've seen the
frequencies for yourself.

00:42:09.740 --> 00:42:13.820 align:middle line:84%
And now he just downloads
information in huge quantities

00:42:13.820 --> 00:42:15.810 align:middle line:90%
all the time.

00:42:15.810 --> 00:42:17.790 align:middle line:84%
This five-year-old
said to his mom.

00:42:17.790 --> 00:42:20.280 align:middle line:10%
"I learn more on the
ships than I do at school.

00:42:20.280 --> 00:42:22.650 align:middle line:10%
He's five years old.

00:42:22.650 --> 00:42:25.380 align:middle line:10%
They float, not walk,
and become invisible.

00:42:25.380 --> 00:42:26.460 align:middle line:10%
There are blue ones too.

00:42:26.460 --> 00:42:29.960 align:middle line:10%
I've seen them in
my mind's eye."

00:42:29.960 --> 00:42:31.490 align:middle line:90%
Magic school.

00:42:31.490 --> 00:42:35.300 align:middle line:84%
This is what another
little child said.

00:42:35.300 --> 00:42:37.537 align:middle line:84%
"A white light comes
through the window."

00:42:37.537 --> 00:42:39.620 align:middle line:84%
When her mother said, did
you have any good dreams

00:42:39.620 --> 00:42:40.420 align:middle line:90%
last night.

00:42:40.420 --> 00:42:42.660 align:middle line:84%
Yes, mum, I finished
magic school.

00:42:42.660 --> 00:42:44.960 align:middle line:84%
Mum said, well,
what did you learn?

00:42:44.960 --> 00:42:46.400 align:middle line:90%
Everything, mostly science.

00:42:46.400 --> 00:42:48.440 align:middle line:84%
I learned about
space and gravity.

00:42:48.440 --> 00:42:50.150 align:middle line:90%
Time controls everything.

00:42:50.150 --> 00:42:51.800 align:middle line:90%
Time controls all.

00:42:51.800 --> 00:42:54.260 align:middle line:10%
My son says that a white
light come through his window

00:42:54.260 --> 00:42:58.030 align:middle line:10%
and suddenly he's
there at school."

00:42:58.030 --> 00:43:02.530 align:middle line:10%
So what's the quantum hologram
multi-dimensional education

00:43:02.530 --> 00:43:05.290 align:middle line:10%
that these children
are telling me about

00:43:05.290 --> 00:43:07.300 align:middle line:10%
and have explained to me?

00:43:07.300 --> 00:43:10.060 align:middle line:10%
They're shown not
only about the nature

00:43:10.060 --> 00:43:15.550 align:middle line:10%
of reality, quantum physics, how
to use their psychic abilities,

00:43:15.550 --> 00:43:17.050 align:middle line:10%
but this kind of thing.

00:43:17.050 --> 00:43:20.920 align:middle line:84%
How to pilot spacecraft and
how to navigate star maps.

00:43:20.920 --> 00:43:23.590 align:middle line:90%
Shown advanced technologies.

00:43:23.590 --> 00:43:26.200 align:middle line:84%
Consciousness soul spirit
moving into another form

00:43:26.200 --> 00:43:27.550 align:middle line:90%
of a non-human container.

00:43:27.550 --> 00:43:31.930 align:middle line:84%
And I talked a little bit about
this in one of the last panels,

00:43:31.930 --> 00:43:36.310 align:middle line:84%
where a young boy told me
that at eight years old when

00:43:36.310 --> 00:43:38.350 align:middle line:84%
he was onboard craft
some of the time,

00:43:38.350 --> 00:43:41.440 align:middle line:84%
because his ancestors
and the Manta beings,

00:43:41.440 --> 00:43:47.290 align:middle line:84%
he said sometimes I evaporate
into a Manta body for a task.

00:43:47.290 --> 00:43:50.870 align:middle line:84%
And then when I'm finished, I
come back into my human form.

00:43:50.870 --> 00:43:52.030 align:middle line:90%
This is not unusual.

00:43:52.030 --> 00:43:53.470 align:middle line:84%
I'll talk about
this in a minute,

00:43:53.470 --> 00:43:55.035 align:middle line:90%
more about this in a minute.

00:43:55.035 --> 00:43:56.410 align:middle line:84%
They're shown
genetic engineering

00:43:56.410 --> 00:43:59.080 align:middle line:84%
of different species,
both on and off world.

00:43:59.080 --> 00:44:03.520 align:middle line:84%
And one little girl couldn't
wait to tell me from the US,

00:44:03.520 --> 00:44:05.500 align:middle line:84%
about her experience
two nights before,

00:44:05.500 --> 00:44:07.690 align:middle line:84%
where she'd been taken
to a planet, shown

00:44:07.690 --> 00:44:09.190 align:middle line:84%
how to use her
psychic abilities,

00:44:09.190 --> 00:44:11.620 align:middle line:84%
but then shown
genetic engineering.

00:44:11.620 --> 00:44:13.660 align:middle line:84%
And they were showing
how they mix species

00:44:13.660 --> 00:44:17.440 align:middle line:84%
to seed other planets
and other universes.

00:44:17.440 --> 00:44:19.750 align:middle line:84%
Healing procedures
onboard craft, the nature

00:44:19.750 --> 00:44:21.400 align:middle line:90%
of black holes and wormholes.

00:44:21.400 --> 00:44:23.890 align:middle line:84%
One young lady of
eight also told me

00:44:23.890 --> 00:44:25.870 align:middle line:84%
that she'd been
shown a black hole,

00:44:25.870 --> 00:44:30.100 align:middle line:84%
and also shown wormholes
and seeing how she said,

00:44:30.100 --> 00:44:34.090 align:middle line:84%
I saw the dinosaurs
in real time.

00:44:34.090 --> 00:44:35.830 align:middle line:84%
She was being shown
this and shown

00:44:35.830 --> 00:44:39.820 align:middle line:90%
the nature of what these are.

00:44:39.820 --> 00:44:42.820 align:middle line:84%
To decode and understand script
symbols and light languages,

00:44:42.820 --> 00:44:45.970 align:middle line:84%
time travel technologies,
taken on missions on Earth

00:44:45.970 --> 00:44:47.020 align:middle line:90%
and off world.

00:44:47.020 --> 00:44:49.000 align:middle line:84%
Taught advanced
physics technologies

00:44:49.000 --> 00:44:52.780 align:middle line:84%
to create non-polluting energy
sources, ecologically friendly

00:44:52.780 --> 00:44:56.080 align:middle line:84%
environments, and
interstellar capabilities.

00:44:56.080 --> 00:45:00.690 align:middle line:84%
This is the
multi-dimensional education.

00:45:00.690 --> 00:45:05.180 align:middle line:84%
This young man, I'm
going to call Eli.

00:45:05.180 --> 00:45:07.730 align:middle line:84%
He said, "the present system
doesn't understand us,

00:45:07.730 --> 00:45:10.160 align:middle line:90%
when he's talking about school.

00:45:10.160 --> 00:45:12.860 align:middle line:10%
I know a different type of
math's, and before I came here,

00:45:12.860 --> 00:45:14.780 align:middle line:10%
I was doing light physics.

00:45:14.780 --> 00:45:15.710 align:middle line:10%
I change light.

00:45:15.710 --> 00:45:18.470 align:middle line:10%
I use light to make
things out of light.

00:45:18.470 --> 00:45:20.450 align:middle line:10%
All schools so far
don't accept me.

00:45:20.450 --> 00:45:22.010 align:middle line:10%
I need to go to a
different school,

00:45:22.010 --> 00:45:24.500 align:middle line:10%
because even in my
group, I'm different.

00:45:24.500 --> 00:45:26.780 align:middle line:10%
I'm supposed to be different,
because I learn more

00:45:26.780 --> 00:45:28.940 align:middle line:10%
and I learn differently
than they do.

00:45:28.940 --> 00:45:30.920 align:middle line:10%
I am from a different
star, different planet,

00:45:30.920 --> 00:45:32.450 align:middle line:10%
different universe.

00:45:32.450 --> 00:45:33.980 align:middle line:10%
I know I am a star child.

00:45:33.980 --> 00:45:37.910 align:middle line:10%
I know more science and
maths than are from here.

00:45:37.910 --> 00:45:39.620 align:middle line:10%
I know how to build a portal.

00:45:39.620 --> 00:45:41.630 align:middle line:10%
I know how to teleport."

00:45:41.630 --> 00:45:45.400 align:middle line:10%
Another young child.

00:45:45.400 --> 00:45:47.200 align:middle line:10%
This young lady is Spanish.

00:45:47.200 --> 00:45:48.910 align:middle line:10%
She speaks English
really well, given

00:45:48.910 --> 00:45:50.800 align:middle line:10%
that she comes from Spain.

00:45:50.800 --> 00:45:55.870 align:middle line:10%
And she talks about her
experiences on the spacecraft.

00:45:55.870 --> 00:45:57.640 align:middle line:10%
She said "the
non-human intelligence

00:45:57.640 --> 00:45:59.800 align:middle line:10%
in spacecraft
visit in our dreams

00:45:59.800 --> 00:46:02.200 align:middle line:10%
when we dream we go
to another dimension.

00:46:02.200 --> 00:46:04.000 align:middle line:10%
In one experience, I
was on a spacecraft

00:46:04.000 --> 00:46:05.980 align:middle line:10%
with other star seeds,
children and teens

00:46:05.980 --> 00:46:07.480 align:middle line:10%
of all different ages.

00:46:07.480 --> 00:46:11.170 align:middle line:10%
It was like a classroom teaching
consciousness, humanity,

00:46:11.170 --> 00:46:14.170 align:middle line:10%
evolution, spiritual
consciousness, physics,

00:46:14.170 --> 00:46:15.940 align:middle line:10%
the geometry of light.

00:46:15.940 --> 00:46:19.390 align:middle line:10%
How to levitate to push your
body via electromagnetism

00:46:19.390 --> 00:46:20.680 align:middle line:10%
from the ground.

00:46:20.680 --> 00:46:24.130 align:middle line:10%
I remember being taught how
to move objects with my mind.

00:46:24.130 --> 00:46:26.080 align:middle line:10%
Even if we don't recall
it, the information

00:46:26.080 --> 00:46:28.630 align:middle line:10%
remains in our
subconscious until we need

00:46:28.630 --> 00:46:30.580 align:middle line:10%
it and it will come back to us.

00:46:30.580 --> 00:46:32.980 align:middle line:10%
One time on the craft,
taught quantum physics,

00:46:32.980 --> 00:46:35.680 align:middle line:10%
but more about geometry
frequency vibration

00:46:35.680 --> 00:46:36.490 align:middle line:10%
of mathematics."

00:46:36.490 --> 00:46:38.448 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to let you hear
a little bit from her

00:46:38.448 --> 00:46:39.840 align:middle line:90%
in a minute.

00:46:39.840 --> 00:46:42.220 align:middle line:84%
And this is a drawing
of the classroom.

00:46:42.220 --> 00:46:43.720 align:middle line:90%
Had huge windows.

00:46:43.720 --> 00:46:47.860 align:middle line:84%
You see lots of different
ages, from eight to 24 years.

00:46:47.860 --> 00:46:51.250 align:middle line:84%
The teachers were
star guides humanoid.

00:46:51.250 --> 00:46:53.170 align:middle line:84%
"Teaching the
relationship between pi

00:46:53.170 --> 00:46:56.110 align:middle line:84%
and the number of the
Fibonacci sequence

00:46:56.110 --> 00:46:58.390 align:middle line:90%
in geometry and numerology.

00:46:58.390 --> 00:47:01.270 align:middle line:84%
This drawing shows a moment
I replied to a question.

00:47:01.270 --> 00:47:03.850 align:middle line:84%
And they were happy
for us to participate.

00:47:03.850 --> 00:47:05.860 align:middle line:84%
They don't teach
like school teachers.

00:47:05.860 --> 00:47:09.130 align:middle line:84%
Their education is interactive
and telepathic, creative

00:47:09.130 --> 00:47:10.360 align:middle line:90%
and joyous.

00:47:10.360 --> 00:47:14.080 align:middle line:84%
They took the space craft around
some beautiful places in space

00:47:14.080 --> 00:47:16.210 align:middle line:90%
for us to observe and enjoy.

00:47:16.210 --> 00:47:18.370 align:middle line:84%
And one young
8-year-old boy told me

00:47:18.370 --> 00:47:20.260 align:middle line:84%
that when he went
on the craft, he

00:47:20.260 --> 00:47:23.150 align:middle line:84%
went with a couple of his school
friends and he recognized them.

00:47:23.150 --> 00:47:25.997 align:middle line:84%
And he described being
in an environment where

00:47:25.997 --> 00:47:27.080 align:middle line:90%
there were other children.

00:47:27.080 --> 00:47:29.440 align:middle line:84%
And I said to him,
were the children

00:47:29.440 --> 00:47:31.190 align:middle line:84%
all the same kind
of human children?

00:47:31.190 --> 00:47:31.990 align:middle line:90%
And he said no.

00:47:31.990 --> 00:47:33.850 align:middle line:84%
Some had different,
were different,

00:47:33.850 --> 00:47:34.970 align:middle line:90%
were not quite human.

00:47:34.970 --> 00:47:36.370 align:middle line:90%
Their eyes were different.

00:47:36.370 --> 00:47:40.390 align:middle line:84%
And he talked about being able
to manifest things and move

00:47:40.390 --> 00:47:44.350 align:middle line:84%
things with his mind, and
being taught complex subjects.

00:47:44.350 --> 00:47:47.320 align:middle line:84%
And I said to him, so
these complex subjects,

00:47:47.320 --> 00:47:50.090 align:middle line:90%
can you tell me more about them?

00:47:50.090 --> 00:47:52.090 align:middle line:84%
He said no, because they're
too complex for you.

00:47:52.090 --> 00:47:54.100 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:47:54.100 --> 00:47:55.900 align:middle line:90%
So I thought, right, OK.

00:47:55.900 --> 00:47:58.930 align:middle line:10%
That put me in my
place, didn't it?"

00:47:58.930 --> 00:48:02.660 align:middle line:10%
My grandson's image
of portals he can see.

00:48:02.660 --> 00:48:05.920 align:middle line:10%
And this is a very
interesting one,

00:48:05.920 --> 00:48:07.600 align:middle line:10%
because the
grandmother wrote to me

00:48:07.600 --> 00:48:10.900 align:middle line:10%
and said, after playing
with a spirograph,

00:48:10.900 --> 00:48:13.390 align:middle line:10%
her young grandson was
very excited to tell me

00:48:13.390 --> 00:48:15.160 align:middle line:10%
that what he'd drawn
was exactly what

00:48:15.160 --> 00:48:20.370 align:middle line:10%
the portals in the bush around
his home looked like to him.

00:48:20.370 --> 00:48:26.340 align:middle line:10%
And interestingly, Eli, in my
book, writes about the portals.

00:48:26.340 --> 00:48:29.070 align:middle line:10%
And he said, "you can
go to Orion and back.

00:48:29.070 --> 00:48:31.500 align:middle line:10%
At one time, you
had to go via Mars.

00:48:31.500 --> 00:48:34.230 align:middle line:10%
Now the technology means
you can go there directly.

00:48:34.230 --> 00:48:35.800 align:middle line:10%
You can go in two ways.

00:48:35.800 --> 00:48:38.370 align:middle line:10%
One all in your mind
or in your body,

00:48:38.370 --> 00:48:40.110 align:middle line:10%
as it's a frequency thing."

00:48:40.110 --> 00:48:41.490 align:middle line:10%
So you can do either.

00:48:41.490 --> 00:48:46.740 align:middle line:10%
I've got more stories about
how one young man of seven

00:48:46.740 --> 00:48:51.030 align:middle line:10%
told me that he is able
to go to other planets

00:48:51.030 --> 00:48:54.570 align:middle line:10%
through a portal, which he
uses the ruins as the portal,

00:48:54.570 --> 00:48:57.990 align:middle line:10%
but he said he has to know the
planet's mathematical number.

00:48:57.990 --> 00:48:59.340 align:middle line:90%
And that's the frequency.

00:48:59.340 --> 00:49:03.080 align:middle line:84%
And then he can use them
to go to other planets

00:49:03.080 --> 00:49:05.410 align:middle line:90%
in other dimensions.

00:49:05.410 --> 00:49:07.530 align:middle line:90%
So we've got meet the hybrids.

00:49:07.530 --> 00:49:10.320 align:middle line:84%
I'm sorry, some my
slides have moved.

00:49:10.320 --> 00:49:13.380 align:middle line:90%
I'll thank the angels for that.

00:49:13.380 --> 00:49:15.780 align:middle line:84%
"Meet the Hybrids," and
this is Jacquelin Smith

00:49:15.780 --> 00:49:18.040 align:middle line:84%
in "Meet the Hybrids,"
wonderful book,

00:49:18.040 --> 00:49:20.550 align:middle line:84%
and Barbara Lamb was part
of this wonderful book,

00:49:20.550 --> 00:49:23.280 align:middle line:84%
along with Miguel
Mendonca as part of it.

00:49:23.280 --> 00:49:25.440 align:middle line:84%
And what is brilliant,
is the stories

00:49:25.440 --> 00:49:29.640 align:middle line:84%
in it are explaining a hybrid's
understanding of themself

00:49:29.640 --> 00:49:31.440 align:middle line:90%
in a human form.

00:49:31.440 --> 00:49:35.640 align:middle line:84%
But what I wanted to say
briefly about that is,

00:49:35.640 --> 00:49:38.610 align:middle line:84%
what Jacquelin Smith is
saying here, "hybrids on Earth

00:49:38.610 --> 00:49:40.770 align:middle line:84%
helped to raise the
frequency of human kind

00:49:40.770 --> 00:49:44.670 align:middle line:84%
so humans can evolve and
embrace their cosmic family.

00:49:44.670 --> 00:49:46.770 align:middle line:84%
With major paradigm
shifts taking place,

00:49:46.770 --> 00:49:49.500 align:middle line:84%
humanity is evolving
into a new human.

00:49:49.500 --> 00:49:51.420 align:middle line:84%
This means the DNA
of the human kind

00:49:51.420 --> 00:49:53.910 align:middle line:84%
is changing in ways in
which we're allowing them

00:49:53.910 --> 00:49:56.730 align:middle line:90%
to expand in consciousness."

00:49:56.730 --> 00:49:59.430 align:middle line:84%
Same theme time
and time again, is

00:49:59.430 --> 00:50:02.430 align:middle line:84%
that we're being activated
in our awareness,

00:50:02.430 --> 00:50:05.670 align:middle line:84%
our DNA is being activated,
our multi-dimensional DNA

00:50:05.670 --> 00:50:07.480 align:middle line:90%
also is being activated.

00:50:07.480 --> 00:50:10.155 align:middle line:84%
So we can evolve into
a more aware species.

00:50:10.155 --> 00:50:12.730 align:middle line:90%


00:50:12.730 --> 00:50:19.330 align:middle line:10%
And this is what was said about
the new human, again, from Zac.

00:50:19.330 --> 00:50:21.130 align:middle line:10%
"Hybrids are expressing
their consciousness

00:50:21.130 --> 00:50:23.810 align:middle line:10%
through their DNA,
as is the new human.

00:50:23.810 --> 00:50:26.630 align:middle line:10%
The hybrids are part of
the new human archetype

00:50:26.630 --> 00:50:28.330 align:middle line:10%
we're evolving into.

00:50:28.330 --> 00:50:29.410 align:middle line:10%
The labels don't matter.

00:50:29.410 --> 00:50:30.550 align:middle line:10%
The humans are evolving.

00:50:30.550 --> 00:50:34.390 align:middle line:10%
Our DNA's advancing, and we'll
express it in any way possible.

00:50:34.390 --> 00:50:36.370 align:middle line:10%
It's contained in our DNA.

00:50:36.370 --> 00:50:38.380 align:middle line:84%
There is scalar
imprinted memories

00:50:38.380 --> 00:50:43.150 align:middle line:84%
of all the other beings in our
DNA that has passed through.

00:50:43.150 --> 00:50:45.820 align:middle line:84%
We can express it in the
new element template.

00:50:45.820 --> 00:50:49.480 align:middle line:10%
We can express it in the hybrid
forms, such as Indigo crystal.

00:50:49.480 --> 00:50:52.480 align:middle line:10%
That is the energy they're
expressing or perceiving

00:50:52.480 --> 00:50:55.050 align:middle line:10%
through their reality lens
and what we are emitting.

00:50:55.050 --> 00:50:57.530 align:middle line:10%
It's all interconnected, but
you perceive it as different

00:50:57.530 --> 00:50:58.330 align:middle line:10%
if you wish to.

00:50:58.330 --> 00:51:00.850 align:middle line:10%


00:51:00.850 --> 00:51:02.950 align:middle line:10%
So I'm not sure if this
one's the video or not.

00:51:02.950 --> 00:51:04.280 align:middle line:10%
I don't think it is.

00:51:04.280 --> 00:51:06.190 align:middle line:10%
I think the next
one's the video.

00:51:06.190 --> 00:51:08.290 align:middle line:10%
This is Marina again from Spain.

00:51:08.290 --> 00:51:11.950 align:middle line:10%
She's done some beautiful
little clips for me in video.

00:51:11.950 --> 00:51:15.430 align:middle line:10%
But this is how she
was aware that she

00:51:15.430 --> 00:51:17.320 align:middle line:10%
was, in fact, a hybrid.

00:51:17.320 --> 00:51:20.320 align:middle line:10%
"I realized I had ET features
no one else in my family had.

00:51:20.320 --> 00:51:24.820 align:middle line:10%
Such slanted eyes, oval
face, weak jaw, pointed chin,

00:51:24.820 --> 00:51:28.550 align:middle line:10%
elongated neck, small mouth, and
a body temperature of 35 to 30

00:51:28.550 --> 00:51:32.290 align:middle line:10%
C. I asked myself, where
did my genes come from?

00:51:32.290 --> 00:51:35.230 align:middle line:10%
I started to feel sense
ETs abducted my mom when

00:51:35.230 --> 00:51:38.710 align:middle line:10%
I was an egg and gave me alien
genetics," is the way she's put

00:51:38.710 --> 00:51:40.100 align:middle line:10%
it.

00:51:40.100 --> 00:51:40.900 align:middle line:10%
Right.

00:51:40.900 --> 00:51:42.760 align:middle line:10%
Now let me just
send a little, let

00:51:42.760 --> 00:51:46.050 align:middle line:10%
you hear a little bit of Marina.

00:51:46.050 --> 00:51:49.990 align:middle line:10%
>> At 15 years old, I made my
consciousness because I came

00:51:49.990 --> 00:51:55.630 align:middle line:10%
here with a wake-up calling card
in my DNA to the term to wake

00:51:55.630 --> 00:51:57.040 align:middle line:10%
up at a turning
point in my life,

00:51:57.040 --> 00:52:00.280 align:middle line:10%
which is something that many
star children came with.

00:52:00.280 --> 00:52:03.120 align:middle line:10%
And so I started to
experience memory recalls

00:52:03.120 --> 00:52:06.640 align:middle line:10%
of extraterrestrial contact,
extraterrestrial incarnations,

00:52:06.640 --> 00:52:10.510 align:middle line:10%
my own star system
connections or expansions.

00:52:10.510 --> 00:52:13.330 align:middle line:10%
Also, great expansion
of my psychic abilities.

00:52:13.330 --> 00:52:17.940 align:middle line:10%
I became highly sensitive when
I was with the external reality.

00:52:17.940 --> 00:52:21.480 align:middle line:10%
I will be able to read more
strongly the people's thoughts.

00:52:21.480 --> 00:52:23.530 align:middle line:10%
I will be able to
read their own energy,

00:52:23.530 --> 00:52:27.170 align:middle line:10%
to read their own emotions,
to read their name,

00:52:27.170 --> 00:52:30.220 align:middle line:10%
and their own genetics,
their own connection

00:52:30.220 --> 00:52:31.660 align:middle line:10%
to their star systems.

00:52:31.660 --> 00:52:35.530 align:middle line:10%
And while it can
be very frustrating

00:52:35.530 --> 00:52:38.470 align:middle line:10%
sometimes for star children,
because we are very sensitive.

00:52:38.470 --> 00:52:40.720 align:middle line:10%
So I will recommend
that if you pick up

00:52:40.720 --> 00:52:44.590 align:middle line:10%
negative energy of low
frequency energy because you're

00:52:44.590 --> 00:52:46.460 align:middle line:10%
very sensitive, I
will recommend you

00:52:46.460 --> 00:52:49.390 align:middle line:10%
that you not fight the
emotion, that you do not

00:52:49.390 --> 00:52:50.800 align:middle line:10%
fight that energy.

00:52:50.800 --> 00:52:53.220 align:middle line:10%
That you, because
resistance is actually

00:52:53.220 --> 00:52:59.740 align:middle line:10%
slowing down the process of
getting out of that frequency.

00:52:59.740 --> 00:53:04.180 align:middle line:10%
So ground into
that energy and try

00:53:04.180 --> 00:53:08.700 align:middle line:10%
to balance it, to try to bring
it to a higher frequency.

00:53:08.700 --> 00:53:13.340 align:middle line:10%
Try to transform
it into love again.

00:53:13.340 --> 00:53:16.670 align:middle line:10%
I also started to experience
seeing the human aura,

00:53:16.670 --> 00:53:20.090 align:middle line:10%
and that also comes
with seeing spirits.

00:53:20.090 --> 00:53:22.630 align:middle line:10%
So don't be scared,
you know, beings.

00:53:22.630 --> 00:53:24.940 align:middle line:10%
This is other dimensions.

00:53:24.940 --> 00:53:28.550 align:middle line:10%
And while auras,
seeing auras can

00:53:28.550 --> 00:53:33.540 align:middle line:10%
be a little bit distracting when
it comes to classes, it's good.

00:53:33.540 --> 00:53:35.230 align:middle line:10%
It's a nice ability.

00:53:35.230 --> 00:53:38.000 align:middle line:10%
I will also experience
precognitive dreams.

00:53:38.000 --> 00:53:42.260 align:middle line:10%
Like every day, I
will, don't fear

00:53:42.260 --> 00:53:44.300 align:middle line:10%
if sometimes you have a
dream and that happens

00:53:44.300 --> 00:53:45.860 align:middle line:10%
in the physical reality.

00:53:45.860 --> 00:53:47.790 align:middle line:10%
We have that ability.

00:53:47.790 --> 00:53:50.090 align:middle line:10%
And sometimes I
will also read when

00:53:50.090 --> 00:53:52.880 align:middle line:10%
something is going to happen
three seconds after I see it

00:53:52.880 --> 00:53:54.170 align:middle line:10%
in my brain.

00:53:54.170 --> 00:53:57.030 align:middle line:10%
It's very normal to have
these kind of abilities

00:53:57.030 --> 00:53:59.850 align:middle line:10%
when you're vibrating on
a higher consciousness.

00:53:59.850 --> 00:54:03.050 align:middle line:10%
And we also have
another nice ability.

00:54:03.050 --> 00:54:07.400 align:middle line:10%
We have the ability to
manipulate space and time.

00:54:07.400 --> 00:54:12.590 align:middle line:10%
So if you're late to
school or someplace,

00:54:12.590 --> 00:54:18.440 align:middle line:10%
you can stretch, the space
time, and you can actually

00:54:18.440 --> 00:54:21.620 align:middle line:10%
get, arrive on point.

00:54:21.620 --> 00:54:25.280 align:middle line:10%
And be careful also with
ability of manipulating

00:54:25.280 --> 00:54:28.770 align:middle line:10%
the electromagnetic fields,
such as the light, you know,

00:54:28.770 --> 00:54:30.470 align:middle line:10%
laptops.

00:54:30.470 --> 00:54:35.630 align:middle line:10%
Because one day I turned off
a laptop with my own brain

00:54:35.630 --> 00:54:37.920 align:middle line:10%
and it didn't work anymore.

00:54:37.920 --> 00:54:40.180 align:middle line:10%
So be careful.

00:54:40.180 --> 00:54:42.950 align:middle line:10%
And we also have the ability
to heal with our hands,

00:54:42.950 --> 00:54:47.450 align:middle line:10%
because the DNA stored in our
hands is more crystalline.

00:54:47.450 --> 00:54:50.600 align:middle line:10%
So we can actually manipulate
energy a lot with our hands.

00:54:50.600 --> 00:54:54.740 align:middle line:10%
So we can use it to
heal other humans.

00:54:54.740 --> 00:54:58.640 align:middle line:10%
In regardance with extra
dimensional experiences,

00:54:58.640 --> 00:55:01.190 align:middle line:10%
alien contact, I experienced
it, and some of you

00:55:01.190 --> 00:55:04.970 align:middle line:10%
will experience it or
have experienced it.

00:55:04.970 --> 00:55:06.890 align:middle line:10%
Well, an abduction,
for example, can

00:55:06.890 --> 00:55:10.650 align:middle line:10%
happen either in the physical
way or in the metaphysical way.

00:55:10.650 --> 00:55:13.810 align:middle line:10%
You know, your soul
goes over your body.

00:55:13.810 --> 00:55:16.020 align:middle line:10%
In regardance to my
physical abduction,

00:55:16.020 --> 00:55:19.070 align:middle line:10%
they erase my memory on
purpose, and that is something

00:55:19.070 --> 00:55:21.050 align:middle line:10%
that they will do frequently.

00:55:21.050 --> 00:55:24.560 align:middle line:10%
But you have to understand that
do not try to force the memory

00:55:24.560 --> 00:55:25.500 align:middle line:10%
to come back to you.

00:55:25.500 --> 00:55:29.380 align:middle line:10%
Because even if you don't
recall the memory, you are,

00:55:29.380 --> 00:55:31.250 align:middle line:10%
you actually have
that information

00:55:31.250 --> 00:55:33.710 align:middle line:10%
that they contacted you
in their subconscious.

00:55:33.710 --> 00:55:36.310 align:middle line:10%
So you can channel
that information

00:55:36.310 --> 00:55:39.770 align:middle line:10%
and let it come through.

00:55:39.770 --> 00:55:41.810 align:middle line:10%
Talking about channelling,
it's very normal

00:55:41.810 --> 00:55:45.350 align:middle line:10%
that we usually start to channel
information about something,

00:55:45.350 --> 00:55:46.310 align:middle line:10%
you know.

00:55:46.310 --> 00:55:49.940 align:middle line:10%
Such as me first time channeling
physics, you know, it's very,

00:55:49.940 --> 00:55:52.520 align:middle line:10%
it's very,
recommendable that you

00:55:52.520 --> 00:55:56.730 align:middle line:10%
write down all, the downloads of
information that you may have.

00:55:56.730 --> 00:55:59.000 align:middle line:10%
In regardance to the
astral abductions

00:55:59.000 --> 00:56:01.550 align:middle line:10%
or the astral contact,
it's more frequently

00:56:01.550 --> 00:56:04.490 align:middle line:10%
happening you know,
because it's easier way

00:56:04.490 --> 00:56:07.630 align:middle line:10%
to contact, you know, an
extraterrestrial being.

00:56:07.630 --> 00:56:10.760 align:middle line:10%
I have to recall it, and
you know, I was in a ship

00:56:10.760 --> 00:56:14.450 align:middle line:10%
and there was this
extraterrestrial talking to me.

00:56:14.450 --> 00:56:16.330 align:middle line:10%
Sometimes the
information, you receive

00:56:16.330 --> 00:56:19.490 align:middle line:10%
it telepathically more
than you know, verbally.

00:56:19.490 --> 00:56:23.060 align:middle line:10%
And it's a good sign, you
know, to receive it directly.

00:56:23.060 --> 00:56:26.000 align:middle line:10%
So I will recommend
to you that do not

00:56:26.000 --> 00:56:27.620 align:middle line:10%
fear the contact experience.

00:56:27.620 --> 00:56:33.380 align:middle line:10%
That you remain super,
super calm, and super, super

00:56:33.380 --> 00:56:36.260 align:middle line:10%
you know, just
confident, you know,

00:56:36.260 --> 00:56:38.680 align:middle line:10%
because they're not
going to harm you.

00:56:38.680 --> 00:56:39.860 align:middle line:10%
You're vibrating love.

00:56:39.860 --> 00:56:41.570 align:middle line:10%
They cannot harm you.

00:56:41.570 --> 00:56:44.630 align:middle line:10%
And remember that your
star family is always

00:56:44.630 --> 00:56:46.710 align:middle line:10%
protecting you and your guides.

00:56:46.710 --> 00:56:51.050 align:middle line:10%
So don't fear the
contact experience.

00:56:51.050 --> 00:56:53.900 align:middle line:10%
And also I will recommend
to you, the last thing,

00:56:53.900 --> 00:56:55.970 align:middle line:10%
that you are, it's
very important

00:56:55.970 --> 00:56:57.950 align:middle line:10%
that you are very
respectful when it comes

00:56:57.950 --> 00:56:59.480 align:middle line:10%
to extraterrestrial contact.

00:56:59.480 --> 00:57:02.600 align:middle line:10%
It's very important,
respect, you know.

00:57:02.600 --> 00:57:06.030 align:middle line:10%
So I guess that's all.

00:57:06.030 --> 00:57:08.410 align:middle line:10%
>> She's not 16 anymore.

00:57:08.410 --> 00:57:10.370 align:middle line:10%
She's a few years older.

00:57:10.370 --> 00:57:12.620 align:middle line:84%
She was, she said
even when she was

00:57:12.620 --> 00:57:15.560 align:middle line:84%
six, when she was
outside sometimes,

00:57:15.560 --> 00:57:18.030 align:middle line:84%
she would see the
black helicopters.

00:57:18.030 --> 00:57:20.990 align:middle line:84%
And she was also told
when she was about 13,

00:57:20.990 --> 00:57:23.367 align:middle line:84%
she kept getting this
information in her head,

00:57:23.367 --> 00:57:24.950 align:middle line:84%
you've got to go to
the States, you've

00:57:24.950 --> 00:57:27.720 align:middle line:84%
got to be part of the star, the
space program and all the rest

00:57:27.720 --> 00:57:28.520 align:middle line:90%
of it.

00:57:28.520 --> 00:57:32.430 align:middle line:84%
And she knew that wasn't
coming from the right place.

00:57:32.430 --> 00:57:34.260 align:middle line:84%
So that's the
other side to this,

00:57:34.260 --> 00:57:37.190 align:middle line:84%
because we know
that there are those

00:57:37.190 --> 00:57:40.700 align:middle line:84%
on this planet that don't
want this to happen,

00:57:40.700 --> 00:57:41.660 align:middle line:90%
for us to wake up.

00:57:41.660 --> 00:57:45.110 align:middle line:90%


00:57:45.110 --> 00:57:46.580 align:middle line:84%
Three kinds of
hybrids, and I will

00:57:46.580 --> 00:57:47.925 align:middle line:90%
explain what she's saying here.

00:57:47.925 --> 00:57:49.800 align:middle line:84%
I'm sorry, my slides
have moved a little bit.

00:57:49.800 --> 00:57:52.340 align:middle line:10%
So what she's
saying is that there

00:57:52.340 --> 00:57:54.650 align:middle line:10%
are many types of hybrids.

00:57:54.650 --> 00:57:57.410 align:middle line:10%
But she's isolating three here.

00:57:57.410 --> 00:58:00.980 align:middle line:10%
The human DNA of the star seed,
the DNA from human parents

00:58:00.980 --> 00:58:03.050 align:middle line:10%
and metaphysical
soul genetics blended

00:58:03.050 --> 00:58:06.370 align:middle line:10%
together expresses the
ET higher frequency.

00:58:06.370 --> 00:58:08.810 align:middle line:10%
Star seed that's awakened to
their multi-dimensional self

00:58:08.810 --> 00:58:11.540 align:middle line:10%
or true essence of unconditional
love and reconnects

00:58:11.540 --> 00:58:13.010 align:middle line:10%
to its star origins.

00:58:13.010 --> 00:58:17.390 align:middle line:10%
The star seed that was
added to the ET genetics,

00:58:17.390 --> 00:58:19.460 align:middle line:10%
such as when her
mother was pregnant,

00:58:19.460 --> 00:58:21.860 align:middle line:10%
they genetically altered
her with their DNA.

00:58:21.860 --> 00:58:24.050 align:middle line:10%
So she connects more
to the consciousness

00:58:24.050 --> 00:58:26.750 align:middle line:10%
of her star origins,
which are Andromeda

00:58:26.750 --> 00:58:30.350 align:middle line:10%
Arcturus and the GREY.

00:58:30.350 --> 00:58:35.090 align:middle line:84%
So these are some of the
beings that she interacts with.

00:58:35.090 --> 00:58:38.960 align:middle line:84%
The purple one she said is
a female Arcturian guide.

00:58:38.960 --> 00:58:41.090 align:middle line:90%
She saw her first in dreams.

00:58:41.090 --> 00:58:43.550 align:middle line:84%
The green one is a hybrid
child, the genetic mix

00:58:43.550 --> 00:58:45.470 align:middle line:90%
between human ET DNA.

00:58:45.470 --> 00:58:49.280 align:middle line:84%
Sorry, human DNA, GREY,
Mantid an Arcturian energy.

00:58:49.280 --> 00:58:51.470 align:middle line:84%
You know, I talked about
little eight-year-old

00:58:51.470 --> 00:58:54.440 align:middle line:84%
being shown how they'll
mix various genetics

00:58:54.440 --> 00:58:56.180 align:middle line:90%
of different species.

00:58:56.180 --> 00:58:57.980 align:middle line:84%
The brown-eyed
being a human Zeta.

00:58:57.980 --> 00:59:01.000 align:middle line:84%
This is an Essassani
GREY hybrid.

00:59:01.000 --> 00:59:04.290 align:middle line:84%
And the long-haired male is a
Pleiadian guide called Mako.

00:59:04.290 --> 00:59:06.510 align:middle line:84%
A Zeta, she said she
saw in her dreams,

00:59:06.510 --> 00:59:09.620 align:middle line:84%
helps to provide the genetics
between humans and themselves

00:59:09.620 --> 00:59:11.420 align:middle line:90%
to create the hybrids opposite.

00:59:11.420 --> 00:59:13.680 align:middle line:84%
So she's actually
showing that as well.

00:59:13.680 --> 00:59:17.540 align:middle line:84%
So she's got a lot of
information on multiple levels.

00:59:17.540 --> 00:59:20.070 align:middle line:10%
But now I'm going to tell
you about a family affair.

00:59:20.070 --> 00:59:25.580 align:middle line:10%
And this one was a lady who was
a former air hostess in Brazil.

00:59:25.580 --> 00:59:27.350 align:middle line:10%
And what was very
interesting, was

00:59:27.350 --> 00:59:30.570 align:middle line:10%
that she had this experience
and didn't know who to talk to.

00:59:30.570 --> 00:59:34.760 align:middle line:10%
And because a lot of
ufological researchers

00:59:34.760 --> 00:59:36.230 align:middle line:10%
really struggle
with some of this,

00:59:36.230 --> 00:59:38.930 align:middle line:10%
because we know that it's
not all physical anyway,

00:59:38.930 --> 00:59:41.253 align:middle line:10%
so it's much harder
to quantify, she

00:59:41.253 --> 00:59:43.670 align:middle line:10%
got in touch with me, because
she'd seen my presentations.

00:59:43.670 --> 00:59:47.120 align:middle line:10%
And she said, she
used to remember

00:59:47.120 --> 00:59:53.990 align:middle line:10%
as a child seeing this loving
female cat feline being

00:59:53.990 --> 00:59:56.870 align:middle line:10%
in a dream about
three meters tall,

00:59:56.870 --> 01:00:00.140 align:middle line:10%
very thin with a cat-looking
face, very loving.

01:00:00.140 --> 01:00:03.020 align:middle line:10%
And as a child, she thought,
she's also my mother.

01:00:03.020 --> 01:00:05.990 align:middle line:10%
Had this feeling as a child.

01:00:05.990 --> 01:00:08.240 align:middle line:10%
She also had dreams where
beings came to a room

01:00:08.240 --> 01:00:11.510 align:middle line:10%
and held her hands, and she
flew to space ship in the sky,

01:00:11.510 --> 01:00:14.600 align:middle line:10%
teaching me about spirituality
most of all, she said.

01:00:14.600 --> 01:00:16.520 align:middle line:10%
One of them was
talking about chakras.

01:00:16.520 --> 01:00:18.270 align:middle line:10%
And from his hand, came light.

01:00:18.270 --> 01:00:21.290 align:middle line:10%
And each time, a different
color came over my body.

01:00:21.290 --> 01:00:25.400 align:middle line:10%
Now the thing that had confused
her and frightened her,

01:00:25.400 --> 01:00:27.560 align:middle line:10%
was this.

01:00:27.560 --> 01:00:32.210 align:middle line:10%
She was in a hotel on
her way to breakfast

01:00:32.210 --> 01:00:34.340 align:middle line:10%
when she was still
working as an air hostess.

01:00:34.340 --> 01:00:37.823 align:middle line:84%
And there's this little
girl in the passageway.

01:00:37.823 --> 01:00:39.740 align:middle line:84%
And she's worried, because
the little girl has

01:00:39.740 --> 01:00:42.582 align:middle line:84%
no one, no mother
around or anything,

01:00:42.582 --> 01:00:44.290 align:middle line:84%
and she's worried
about this little girl.

01:00:44.290 --> 01:00:47.570 align:middle line:84%
And so she goes up to her
without seeing her fully,

01:00:47.570 --> 01:00:50.180 align:middle line:84%
and says to her, you know,
where is your parents?

01:00:50.180 --> 01:00:51.470 align:middle line:90%
Where's your mum?

01:00:51.470 --> 01:00:53.090 align:middle line:84%
When the little
girl turns round,

01:00:53.090 --> 01:00:55.970 align:middle line:84%
you'll see the face
here at the bottom.

01:00:55.970 --> 01:00:58.100 align:middle line:10%
She saw was this strange face.

01:00:58.100 --> 01:01:01.010 align:middle line:10%
And she thought to herself,
oh, she's a monster.

01:01:01.010 --> 01:01:01.940 align:middle line:90%
And she ran away.

01:01:01.940 --> 01:01:04.450 align:middle line:90%


01:01:04.450 --> 01:01:07.930 align:middle line:10%
Now let me go
backtrack a little bit.

01:01:07.930 --> 01:01:10.420 align:middle line:10%
In 2002, she said
she woke up thinking

01:01:10.420 --> 01:01:11.380 align:middle line:10%
she was at the doctors.

01:01:11.380 --> 01:01:14.740 align:middle line:10%
Close to her feet was a
being with dark, huge eyes.

01:01:14.740 --> 01:01:16.900 align:middle line:10%
Later, she could
feel a little ball

01:01:16.900 --> 01:01:18.910 align:middle line:10%
on the right side of her womb.

01:01:18.910 --> 01:01:21.040 align:middle line:10%
As time passed,
the ball was gone.

01:01:21.040 --> 01:01:24.575 align:middle line:10%
Now many of us are aware who
researched this, and those

01:01:24.575 --> 01:01:26.200 align:middle line:10%
who've had experiences,
of what we call

01:01:26.200 --> 01:01:29.080 align:middle line:10%
the missing
pregnancy-type syndrome,

01:01:29.080 --> 01:01:32.020 align:middle line:10%
which sounds very
much like this.

01:01:32.020 --> 01:01:33.970 align:middle line:10%
In 2008, leaving
a hotel room, she

01:01:33.970 --> 01:01:36.310 align:middle line:10%
saw this little girl about
four or five years old.

01:01:36.310 --> 01:01:38.020 align:middle line:10%
She didn't open her
mouth, but I could

01:01:38.020 --> 01:01:41.380 align:middle line:10%
hear a voice inside my
mind saying, mummy, mummy.

01:01:41.380 --> 01:01:44.090 align:middle line:84%
I understood the child
was looking for a mother.

01:01:44.090 --> 01:01:46.060 align:middle line:90%
So I asked, where is your mum?

01:01:46.060 --> 01:01:47.110 align:middle line:90%
Her face changed.

01:01:47.110 --> 01:01:48.880 align:middle line:90%
She had bigger, black eyes.

01:01:48.880 --> 01:01:52.030 align:middle line:84%
Her mouth looked swollen, and
she could read my thoughts.

01:01:52.030 --> 01:01:55.870 align:middle line:84%
I was so scared, I ran away,
thinking she was a monster.

01:01:55.870 --> 01:01:57.880 align:middle line:84%
The last time they took
me to the spaceship,

01:01:57.880 --> 01:02:01.420 align:middle line:84%
they showed me hybrid
kids and the girl I

01:02:01.420 --> 01:02:04.090 align:middle line:90%
saw in the hotel room in 2008.

01:02:04.090 --> 01:02:06.790 align:middle line:84%
She was bigger,
like a pre-teenager.

01:02:06.790 --> 01:02:09.310 align:middle line:84%
And I realized she was
part of another race,

01:02:09.310 --> 01:02:12.040 align:middle line:90%
but she was also my daughter.

01:02:12.040 --> 01:02:15.610 align:middle line:10%
And all these others that
she's drawn are the same

01:02:15.610 --> 01:02:17.920 align:middle line:10%
and are children as well.

01:02:17.920 --> 01:02:20.560 align:middle line:84%
The last time they took
me to the spaceship,

01:02:20.560 --> 01:02:22.930 align:middle line:84%
they showed me the
hybrid kids and the girl

01:02:22.930 --> 01:02:24.760 align:middle line:90%
I saw at the hotel.

01:02:24.760 --> 01:02:27.460 align:middle line:84%
I understood she was a
hybrid of the same race

01:02:27.460 --> 01:02:31.420 align:middle line:84%
as the woman with the cat
face I always saw as a child.

01:02:31.420 --> 01:02:34.930 align:middle line:84%
The feline woman sometimes
brings her to see me

01:02:34.930 --> 01:02:37.420 align:middle line:84%
or to play with my
six-year-old daughter,

01:02:37.420 --> 01:02:40.090 align:middle line:84%
because she'd seen her
six-year-old daughter

01:02:40.090 --> 01:02:44.920 align:middle line:84%
playing with her hybrid
sister on board craft.

01:02:44.920 --> 01:02:48.200 align:middle line:90%
But it's not over.

01:02:48.200 --> 01:02:50.590 align:middle line:84%
This is some of the
information since then

01:02:50.590 --> 01:02:51.833 align:middle line:90%
that she's been given.

01:02:51.833 --> 01:02:53.500 align:middle line:84%
I was told they're
not allowed to abduct

01:02:53.500 --> 01:02:55.510 align:middle line:90%
humans to create hybrids.

01:02:55.510 --> 01:02:58.870 align:middle line:10%
Hybrids volunteer to
incarnate into a human body

01:02:58.870 --> 01:03:00.670 align:middle line:10%
to accomplish a mission.

01:03:00.670 --> 01:03:02.110 align:middle line:84%
Once I knew this
then, the feeling

01:03:02.110 --> 01:03:05.020 align:middle line:84%
of being a victim and all
my panic and fear left me.

01:03:05.020 --> 01:03:08.260 align:middle line:84%
It made sense that the GREYS
were monitoring my pregnancies.

01:03:08.260 --> 01:03:10.210 align:middle line:84%
The human race is
being improved somehow.

01:03:10.210 --> 01:03:12.850 align:middle line:90%


01:03:12.850 --> 01:03:15.940 align:middle line:10%
So my daughter plays
with a hybrid sibling.

01:03:15.940 --> 01:03:17.440 align:middle line:10%
I witness when the
hybrid daughter

01:03:17.440 --> 01:03:20.380 align:middle line:10%
arrives and comes close to
her when she is sleeping.

01:03:20.380 --> 01:03:22.660 align:middle line:10%
My daughter sits on her
bed and suddenly smiles

01:03:22.660 --> 01:03:24.730 align:middle line:10%
and is very happy
and plays with her.

01:03:24.730 --> 01:03:27.250 align:middle line:10%
I believe her presence
somehow takes my daughter out

01:03:27.250 --> 01:03:28.330 align:middle line:10%
of her body.

01:03:28.330 --> 01:03:30.700 align:middle line:10%
I think my hybrid
daughter may be about 15,

01:03:30.700 --> 01:03:32.740 align:middle line:10%
but physically looks about 12.

01:03:32.740 --> 01:03:34.840 align:middle line:10%
She has normal
skin to the human,

01:03:34.840 --> 01:03:37.390 align:middle line:10%
eyes are bigger with no
white, the jaw very different.

01:03:37.390 --> 01:03:39.070 align:middle line:10%
Nose and hair look human.

01:03:39.070 --> 01:03:42.400 align:middle line:10%
She's often coming
with a feline being.

01:03:42.400 --> 01:03:44.320 align:middle line:90%
But, it's all in the family.

01:03:44.320 --> 01:03:47.610 align:middle line:84%
And we were talking about the
intergenerational links, where

01:03:47.610 --> 01:03:51.520 align:middle line:84%
if someone comes to me, I will
find siblings, either mother

01:03:51.520 --> 01:03:54.460 align:middle line:84%
or father or both
or grandparents

01:03:54.460 --> 01:03:59.410 align:middle line:84%
have had some form of experience
or some form of encounter.

01:03:59.410 --> 01:04:02.140 align:middle line:84%
So the eldest daughter
began to tell her mum

01:04:02.140 --> 01:04:04.210 align:middle line:84%
about her own
experiences, and she

01:04:04.210 --> 01:04:06.130 align:middle line:84%
sees this particular
being, which

01:04:06.130 --> 01:04:08.080 align:middle line:90%
you're seeing she's drawn here.

01:04:08.080 --> 01:04:11.020 align:middle line:84%
She said her hair is white with
a blue stone between her eyes.

01:04:11.020 --> 01:04:13.090 align:middle line:84%
She's very tall
with long fingers.

01:04:13.090 --> 01:04:17.970 align:middle line:84%
She showed her star
constellation she called home.

01:04:17.970 --> 01:04:21.760 align:middle line:84%
They were white with
long hair and the land

01:04:21.760 --> 01:04:23.650 align:middle line:90%
is full of snow and ice.

01:04:23.650 --> 01:04:26.290 align:middle line:84%
So there's the picture
of a really interesting

01:04:26.290 --> 01:04:27.280 align:middle line:90%
extraterrestrial.

01:04:27.280 --> 01:04:29.770 align:middle line:10%
And the bottom
line is, that I am

01:04:29.770 --> 01:04:31.780 align:middle line:10%
seeing multiple
kinds of pictures

01:04:31.780 --> 01:04:35.650 align:middle line:10%
of all types of humanoids,
crystalline beings,

01:04:35.650 --> 01:04:39.640 align:middle line:10%
feline beings, lion
beings, reptilian beings,

01:04:39.640 --> 01:04:42.160 align:middle line:10%
a whole range from GREYS.

01:04:42.160 --> 01:04:43.950 align:middle line:84%
I was told that
in terms of GREYS,

01:04:43.950 --> 01:04:47.260 align:middle line:84%
there are at least
165 species of GREY.

01:04:47.260 --> 01:04:49.590 align:middle line:84%
So when we are
looking at this, we

01:04:49.590 --> 01:04:53.080 align:middle line:84%
are looking at
civilizations that

01:04:53.080 --> 01:04:56.740 align:middle line:84%
are interacting with us from
this galaxy and other galaxies,

01:04:56.740 --> 01:04:59.950 align:middle line:84%
as well as inter-dimensional
beings, extra dimensional

01:04:59.950 --> 01:05:02.357 align:middle line:90%
and trans dimensional ones.

01:05:02.357 --> 01:05:03.940 align:middle line:84%
So this is more of
the experience that

01:05:03.940 --> 01:05:05.920 align:middle line:84%
was joined with her
husband, because I

01:05:05.920 --> 01:05:08.500 align:middle line:84%
want to tell you a little bit
about her husband as well.

01:05:08.500 --> 01:05:12.630 align:middle line:84%
This is why this family
has been so interesting.

01:05:12.630 --> 01:05:16.180 align:middle line:10%
The being at the top was a joint
experience with her husband.

01:05:16.180 --> 01:05:18.640 align:middle line:10%
"My husband and I both saw
this being in our bedroom.

01:05:18.640 --> 01:05:20.410 align:middle line:10%
There were strange
effects in the room.

01:05:20.410 --> 01:05:23.380 align:middle line:10%
Doors moving and
lights blinking.

01:05:23.380 --> 01:05:25.720 align:middle line:10%
This being looked about 35.

01:05:25.720 --> 01:05:30.430 align:middle line:10%
Long silver hair, strange eyes,
eyes that were water blue.

01:05:30.430 --> 01:05:34.690 align:middle line:10%
His hands were, from his hands,
two colors, blue and violet.

01:05:34.690 --> 01:05:37.490 align:middle line:10%
My husband felt peace
coming from him.

01:05:37.490 --> 01:05:40.420 align:middle line:10%
It felt like he was connected
to sharing this information

01:05:40.420 --> 01:05:42.910 align:middle line:10%
and wanted to remind me."

01:05:42.910 --> 01:05:44.950 align:middle line:10%
And the lower one
is where she is

01:05:44.950 --> 01:05:48.160 align:middle line:10%
with other extraterrestrial
beings, this lady.

01:05:48.160 --> 01:05:50.950 align:middle line:10%
And he said, "this being
was similar to the beings

01:05:50.950 --> 01:05:53.800 align:middle line:10%
in this group I'd been with.

01:05:53.800 --> 01:05:56.860 align:middle line:10%
I felt he was talking to
me with ideas, not words.

01:05:56.860 --> 01:05:58.780 align:middle line:10%
The group had the
same color uniform,

01:05:58.780 --> 01:06:01.780 align:middle line:10%
which represented our
aura and our mission.

01:06:01.780 --> 01:06:05.320 align:middle line:10%
Many groups of alien races,
I felt like I knew them.

01:06:05.320 --> 01:06:08.080 align:middle line:10%
It felt eager and
happy, supporting

01:06:08.080 --> 01:06:09.610 align:middle line:10%
Earth and our mission.

01:06:09.610 --> 01:06:13.790 align:middle line:10%
Ours was to help the
children," she said.

01:06:13.790 --> 01:06:17.060 align:middle line:84%
"I understood something
was going to change soon.

01:06:17.060 --> 01:06:20.030 align:middle line:84%
A few weeks ago, they took
me with other alien beings

01:06:20.030 --> 01:06:21.380 align:middle line:90%
to a strange open field.

01:06:21.380 --> 01:06:23.390 align:middle line:84%
It was pink and
green and different.

01:06:23.390 --> 01:06:25.100 align:middle line:84%
They were organizing
and guiding us.

01:06:25.100 --> 01:06:26.660 align:middle line:90%
I knew all of them.

01:06:26.660 --> 01:06:28.320 align:middle line:84%
I understood we going
to work together.

01:06:28.320 --> 01:06:31.850 align:middle line:84%
They gave our group a
beautiful uniform color purple.

01:06:31.850 --> 01:06:33.470 align:middle line:84%
They talked about
supporting Earth.

01:06:33.470 --> 01:06:36.740 align:middle line:84%
I already felt I knew this,
and I was part of them.

01:06:36.740 --> 01:06:40.280 align:middle line:84%
I didn't see human, just
different kinds of ETs.

01:06:40.280 --> 01:06:42.470 align:middle line:84%
I understood something
was going to change soon.

01:06:42.470 --> 01:06:45.440 align:middle line:90%


01:06:45.440 --> 01:06:46.970 align:middle line:84%
The color of the
uniform," she said,

01:06:46.970 --> 01:06:49.310 align:middle line:84%
"is different depending on
the tasks on this planet

01:06:49.310 --> 01:06:51.770 align:middle line:84%
and their aura
vibration of the person.

01:06:51.770 --> 01:06:57.500 align:middle line:84%
My group were all aliens,
so I guess I am alien too.

01:06:57.500 --> 01:07:03.800 align:middle line:84%
Green is very spiritual
and is a mental quality.

01:07:03.800 --> 01:07:05.850 align:middle line:90%
The blue guides humanity.

01:07:05.850 --> 01:07:07.790 align:middle line:84%
My group, purple,
helps the new children

01:07:07.790 --> 01:07:11.680 align:middle line:84%
to be strong and
capable of living here."

01:07:11.680 --> 01:07:13.760 align:middle line:10%
Now this was really interesting.

01:07:13.760 --> 01:07:16.400 align:middle line:10%
She sends me messages
every so often

01:07:16.400 --> 01:07:19.100 align:middle line:10%
to say something that's
happened from Brazil.

01:07:19.100 --> 01:07:21.830 align:middle line:10%
And she said, I suddenly
had this thought

01:07:21.830 --> 01:07:25.250 align:middle line:10%
that my six-year-old
daughter was a hybrid.

01:07:25.250 --> 01:07:27.600 align:middle line:10%
And she said, a
couple of days later,

01:07:27.600 --> 01:07:30.650 align:middle line:10%
her husband woke her up and
told her the same thing.

01:07:30.650 --> 01:07:35.030 align:middle line:10%
That their daughter was
a hybrid and a Mantis.

01:07:35.030 --> 01:07:38.780 align:middle line:10%
My husband saw her out of
body and just knew it was her.

01:07:38.780 --> 01:07:42.080 align:middle line:10%
My human daughter has six
toes on her right foot,

01:07:42.080 --> 01:07:46.550 align:middle line:10%
but she said, he'd seen her in
the Mantid form out of body,

01:07:46.550 --> 01:07:49.860 align:middle line:10%
but knew it was his daughter.

01:07:49.860 --> 01:07:53.610 align:middle line:84%
So we've got a whole
new complex way maybe

01:07:53.610 --> 01:07:57.580 align:middle line:84%
of trying to now understand
what does this all mean.

01:07:57.580 --> 01:08:01.020 align:middle line:84%
How does this help us
understand contact?

01:08:01.020 --> 01:08:04.002 align:middle line:84%
What does it mean
to us as a species?

01:08:04.002 --> 01:08:05.460 align:middle line:84%
And I will tell
you one more thing.

01:08:05.460 --> 01:08:08.620 align:middle line:84%
I'm not sure if
I put it in here.

01:08:08.620 --> 01:08:11.040 align:middle line:84%
Oh, this is still about
the daughter first.

01:08:11.040 --> 01:08:14.460 align:middle line:84%
My six-year-old daughter
is immune to many viruses.

01:08:14.460 --> 01:08:17.880 align:middle line:84%
She is six now,
and she's never had

01:08:17.880 --> 01:08:21.630 align:middle line:84%
a cold or fever, show symptoms,
and then recovers quickly.

01:08:21.630 --> 01:08:23.760 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes she places
her hands where it hurts

01:08:23.760 --> 01:08:24.609 align:middle line:90%
and the pain stops.

01:08:24.609 --> 01:08:26.410 align:middle line:90%
So she's also a healer.

01:08:26.410 --> 01:08:28.890 align:middle line:84%
So this is some of the
new ones coming in,

01:08:28.890 --> 01:08:32.130 align:middle line:84%
are connecting, as I told you
about the 8-year-old boy that

01:08:32.130 --> 01:08:35.069 align:middle line:84%
said, my ancestors are the
Mantid, and when I die,

01:08:35.069 --> 01:08:37.890 align:middle line:84%
I'm going back to
being a Mantis.

01:08:37.890 --> 01:08:41.640 align:middle line:84%
So there's a connection with
those that have contact.

01:08:41.640 --> 01:08:43.770 align:middle line:84%
There is going to be a
connection to the beings

01:08:43.770 --> 01:08:45.660 align:middle line:90%
that you're interacting with.

01:08:45.660 --> 01:08:48.479 align:middle line:90%
This becomes quite clear.

01:08:48.479 --> 01:08:51.689 align:middle line:84%
One other thing I did want to
say to you before I move on,

01:08:51.689 --> 01:08:56.490 align:middle line:84%
is the husband, she said
when he gets very emotional,

01:08:56.490 --> 01:08:59.819 align:middle line:84%
she said, I saw him
look like a reptilian.

01:08:59.819 --> 01:09:02.189 align:middle line:84%
And she said he wasn't, you
know, he's a lovely husband,

01:09:02.189 --> 01:09:04.800 align:middle line:90%
he's very kind and caring.

01:09:04.800 --> 01:09:07.140 align:middle line:84%
And she said to him, you're
looking like a reptilian!

01:09:07.140 --> 01:09:08.000 align:middle line:90%
And he said ah.

01:09:08.000 --> 01:09:10.319 align:middle line:84%
He said, I know,
I've seen myself

01:09:10.319 --> 01:09:13.380 align:middle line:84%
in the mirror sometimes
looking like that.

01:09:13.380 --> 01:09:16.240 align:middle line:84%
And apparently, it's usually
when he gets emotional.

01:09:16.240 --> 01:09:20.220 align:middle line:84%
I have now individuals that have
told me that in certain times,

01:09:20.220 --> 01:09:23.250 align:middle line:84%
they've looked at someone and
they've not just seen human.

01:09:23.250 --> 01:09:25.640 align:middle line:90%
>> That happens a lot.

01:09:25.640 --> 01:09:26.649 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

01:09:26.649 --> 01:09:28.948 align:middle line:84%
And it's part of the
higher frequency.

01:09:28.948 --> 01:09:30.490 align:middle line:84%
As you get to the
higher frequencies,

01:09:30.490 --> 01:09:33.430 align:middle line:84%
you're seeing more of what's
going on in the matrix.

01:09:33.430 --> 01:09:37.300 align:middle line:84%
And you're seeing the genetic
lineage of the individual

01:09:37.300 --> 01:09:38.170 align:middle line:90%
as well.

01:09:38.170 --> 01:09:41.569 align:middle line:84%
And that's a whole
other ballgame.

01:09:41.569 --> 01:09:44.270 align:middle line:84%
The new children are
already awake and aware.

01:09:44.270 --> 01:09:48.950 align:middle line:84%
This one is a drawing
from a young two-year-old

01:09:48.950 --> 01:09:51.050 align:middle line:90%
that was talking about auntie.

01:09:51.050 --> 01:09:53.600 align:middle line:84%
Now the Brazilian woman said
that the nonhuman beings

01:09:53.600 --> 01:09:56.360 align:middle line:84%
talk to her after returning
from an abduction.

01:09:56.360 --> 01:09:58.640 align:middle line:84%
She was described as being
immersed in a liquid,

01:09:58.640 --> 01:10:00.170 align:middle line:90%
and was very scared.

01:10:00.170 --> 01:10:03.420 align:middle line:90%
She hadn't told anyone.

01:10:03.420 --> 01:10:10.350 align:middle line:84%
Her two-year-old niece drew
this image of her auntie.

01:10:10.350 --> 01:10:15.240 align:middle line:84%
And she said, Auntie, they
are healing you in this fluid.

01:10:15.240 --> 01:10:17.070 align:middle line:90%
No need to be afraid.

01:10:17.070 --> 01:10:19.340 align:middle line:90%
They are your friends.

01:10:19.340 --> 01:10:23.310 align:middle line:84%
Now remember, Auntie hadn't said
anything about her experiences.

01:10:23.310 --> 01:10:27.020 align:middle line:84%
But the little two-year-old was
able to put her mind at rest.

01:10:27.020 --> 01:10:29.990 align:middle line:84%
So this is the awareness
of the new ones.

01:10:29.990 --> 01:10:32.960 align:middle line:84%
This is another drawing from
a five-year-old in Brazil

01:10:32.960 --> 01:10:34.370 align:middle line:90%
to his auntie.

01:10:34.370 --> 01:10:37.850 align:middle line:84%
Now we're talking about
codes, bringing in the codes,

01:10:37.850 --> 01:10:41.240 align:middle line:84%
the frequencies, through
artwork, through scripts,

01:10:41.240 --> 01:10:43.270 align:middle line:84%
through languages,
all the codes.

01:10:43.270 --> 01:10:45.110 align:middle line:10%
And I'm going to
talk more in depth

01:10:45.110 --> 01:10:47.180 align:middle line:10%
about that in my
workshop, where I'm

01:10:47.180 --> 01:10:52.160 align:middle line:10%
going to show you and let
you hear some of the codes.

01:10:52.160 --> 01:10:56.870 align:middle line:10%
Zac, who had ADHD,
identifies as a center seed.

01:10:56.870 --> 01:10:59.930 align:middle line:10%
Now this is a young man
that told me that this

01:10:59.930 --> 01:11:01.460 align:middle line:10%
was his first incarnation.

01:11:01.460 --> 01:11:05.270 align:middle line:10%
That he came from a planet
where he was, in fact, blue.

01:11:05.270 --> 01:11:08.000 align:middle line:10%
He recalls choosing his mother
and going through a portal

01:11:08.000 --> 01:11:09.410 align:middle line:10%
to be born.

01:11:09.410 --> 01:11:11.390 align:middle line:10%
His first earth life.

01:11:11.390 --> 01:11:13.640 align:middle line:10%
He speaks light languages,
and is triggered if someone

01:11:13.640 --> 01:11:16.460 align:middle line:10%
needs healing, he will help.

01:11:16.460 --> 01:11:20.900 align:middle line:10%
Telepathy is a root or
pattern in his mind.

01:11:20.900 --> 01:11:23.840 align:middle line:10%
He speaks about beings that
created this dimension.

01:11:23.840 --> 01:11:25.040 align:middle line:10%
He works with crystals.

01:11:25.040 --> 01:11:27.710 align:middle line:10%
He can see inter-dimensionally
with his eyes open.

01:11:27.710 --> 01:11:29.900 align:middle line:10%
Mentions the power of
triangles and the invention

01:11:29.900 --> 01:11:33.380 align:middle line:10%
of power devices using
magnetism and water.

01:11:33.380 --> 01:11:35.540 align:middle line:10%
Awareness of many
dimensions and timelines

01:11:35.540 --> 01:11:37.820 align:middle line:10%
and struggles to
focus on one timeline

01:11:37.820 --> 01:11:40.120 align:middle line:10%
where his physical body is.

01:11:40.120 --> 01:11:41.930 align:middle line:10%
Center seed means
the ability to heal

01:11:41.930 --> 01:11:44.330 align:middle line:10%
the planet of its
pollution, rebalance

01:11:44.330 --> 01:11:46.550 align:middle line:10%
the environment for
everyone, not just humans,

01:11:46.550 --> 01:11:48.630 align:middle line:10%
but animals and plants.

01:11:48.630 --> 01:11:51.920 align:middle line:10%
This is a 10-year-old in
western Australia describe.

01:11:51.920 --> 01:11:53.870 align:middle line:10%
And that's the questionnaire
that I sent out.

01:11:53.870 --> 01:11:56.630 align:middle line:84%
You'll notice, there's
lots of highlights.

01:11:56.630 --> 01:11:59.120 align:middle line:84%
This is what he looked
like in the planet

01:11:59.120 --> 01:12:03.860 align:middle line:84%
that he came from before he
came to his first Earth life.

01:12:03.860 --> 01:12:07.310 align:middle line:84%
And he talks about
what was interesting,

01:12:07.310 --> 01:12:09.740 align:middle line:90%
was the symbols down one leg.

01:12:09.740 --> 01:12:11.660 align:middle line:84%
And I actually asked
him to translate

01:12:11.660 --> 01:12:12.590 align:middle line:90%
what the symbols were.

01:12:12.590 --> 01:12:13.880 align:middle line:90%
Could he do that?

01:12:13.880 --> 01:12:16.790 align:middle line:84%
And he's explaining that
they were made meeting him.

01:12:16.790 --> 01:12:19.310 align:middle line:84%
And the second
one was his roots.

01:12:19.310 --> 01:12:25.810 align:middle line:84%
And the last one, a copy of
his, of the plane itself,

01:12:25.810 --> 01:12:26.720 align:middle line:90%
of where we are.

01:12:26.720 --> 01:12:29.340 align:middle line:90%
So again, he's doing symbols.

01:12:29.340 --> 01:12:34.430 align:middle line:84%
Now symbols can be
multi-dimensional, complex

01:12:34.430 --> 01:12:35.670 align:middle line:90%
files of information.

01:12:35.670 --> 01:12:37.910 align:middle line:84%
In other words, one symbol
could fill this room

01:12:37.910 --> 01:12:39.450 align:middle line:90%
with encyclopedias.

01:12:39.450 --> 01:12:42.140 align:middle line:84%
So when we see a symbol
from our dimension,

01:12:42.140 --> 01:12:46.590 align:middle line:84%
we're not actually seeing the
totality of that information.

01:12:46.590 --> 01:12:49.080 align:middle line:84%
This is a little
boy, again, my slides

01:12:49.080 --> 01:12:52.500 align:middle line:90%
have been playing games here.

01:12:52.500 --> 01:12:54.170 align:middle line:90%
How do I connect?

01:12:54.170 --> 01:12:55.820 align:middle line:90%
This is his astral form.

01:12:55.820 --> 01:13:00.130 align:middle line:84%
This is a young boy who told
me he's seven years old.

01:13:00.130 --> 01:13:01.340 align:middle line:90%
He's called Hayden.

01:13:01.340 --> 01:13:02.450 align:middle line:90%
That's his astral form.

01:13:02.450 --> 01:13:04.220 align:middle line:90%
He drew it for me.

01:13:04.220 --> 01:13:06.070 align:middle line:84%
"Before I came to
Earth I was just a will

01:13:06.070 --> 01:13:08.430 align:middle line:90%
of the wisp spirit, angel form.

01:13:08.430 --> 01:13:11.930 align:middle line:84%
I programmed my life on Earth
and decided on my star mission,

01:13:11.930 --> 01:13:14.630 align:middle line:84%
and I found myself
in mummy's tummy.

01:13:14.630 --> 01:13:16.980 align:middle line:90%
My home star planet is Elba.

01:13:16.980 --> 01:13:19.370 align:middle line:84%
I am visited by beings
that look like skeletons.

01:13:19.370 --> 01:13:21.530 align:middle line:84%
I've incarnated as
animal, as well as human

01:13:21.530 --> 01:13:23.540 align:middle line:90%
at the time of the dinosaurs.

01:13:23.540 --> 01:13:26.000 align:middle line:84%
He draws unusual symbols,
visits other places

01:13:26.000 --> 01:13:28.940 align:middle line:84%
beyond his consciousness,
perceives energy fields,

01:13:28.940 --> 01:13:30.770 align:middle line:84%
has traveled to the
moon in another life.

01:13:30.770 --> 01:13:33.020 align:middle line:84%
He can go to the
ninth dimension.

01:13:33.020 --> 01:13:34.370 align:middle line:90%
My thoughts can affect lights.

01:13:34.370 --> 01:13:37.940 align:middle line:10%
And he also told me the little
gray beings can only go as far,

01:13:37.940 --> 01:13:42.170 align:middle line:10%
the ones he sees can only go
as far as the sixth dimension,

01:13:42.170 --> 01:13:45.590 align:middle line:10%
was the way that he
explained it to me.

01:13:45.590 --> 01:13:48.020 align:middle line:84%
"I will go to my Mantid,
ancestors when I die,"

01:13:48.020 --> 01:13:50.770 align:middle line:90%
said the eight-year-old, Paul.

01:13:50.770 --> 01:13:53.270 align:middle line:84%
And as he was talking
to me, he suddenly

01:13:53.270 --> 01:13:57.770 align:middle line:84%
made these trilling chirping
sounds, which now I understand

01:13:57.770 --> 01:13:59.600 align:middle line:90%
were made by the mantis beings.

01:13:59.600 --> 01:14:02.150 align:middle line:84%
And sometimes when I'm
doing a regression,

01:14:02.150 --> 01:14:03.555 align:middle line:90%
there's mantis beings around.

01:14:03.555 --> 01:14:05.180 align:middle line:10%
You can actually hear
in the background

01:14:05.180 --> 01:14:09.670 align:middle line:10%
this trilling sound as well.

01:14:09.670 --> 01:14:12.820 align:middle line:10%
"Soul transfer into
a non-human body.

01:14:12.820 --> 01:14:16.750 align:middle line:10%
On the craft, there is a
Mantid body to go into.

01:14:16.750 --> 01:14:19.990 align:middle line:10%
I leave my physical body and
evaporate from my physical form

01:14:19.990 --> 01:14:20.830 align:middle line:10%
into the Mantid.

01:14:20.830 --> 01:14:22.930 align:middle line:10%
It's a bit like steam.

01:14:22.930 --> 01:14:24.910 align:middle line:10%
It's a bit like steam,
that's how it happens.

01:14:24.910 --> 01:14:28.060 align:middle line:10%
You just think it and
that's how it happens.

01:14:28.060 --> 01:14:33.520 align:middle line:10%
In the free surveys, 15% were
aware of ET soul swapping

01:14:33.520 --> 01:14:35.110 align:middle line:10%
with humans.

01:14:35.110 --> 01:14:40.660 align:middle line:10%
82% believed in a connection
between the beings pre-birth.

01:14:40.660 --> 01:14:43.090 align:middle line:10%
As Paul said, I see the
Mantid in the Lion being.

01:14:43.090 --> 01:14:45.700 align:middle line:10%
So what is happening
with contact

01:14:45.700 --> 01:14:48.230 align:middle line:10%
for many of those of
you that are having it,

01:14:48.230 --> 01:14:50.590 align:middle line:10%
there's often a reason why
certain beings are connecting

01:14:50.590 --> 01:14:54.310 align:middle line:10%
with you, and often it's because
there is more than just them

01:14:54.310 --> 01:14:55.960 align:middle line:10%
wanting to show you their form.

01:14:55.960 --> 01:15:02.240 align:middle line:84%
There is usually a soul family
connection to them as well.

01:15:02.240 --> 01:15:04.210 align:middle line:84%
And I haven't
mentioned walk-ins,

01:15:04.210 --> 01:15:06.490 align:middle line:84%
which is another
part of becoming more

01:15:06.490 --> 01:15:09.820 align:middle line:90%
and more part of my research.

01:15:09.820 --> 01:15:11.800 align:middle line:10%
For those of you
that don't understand

01:15:11.800 --> 01:15:15.070 align:middle line:10%
what a walk-ins soul
is or a soul swap,

01:15:15.070 --> 01:15:19.330 align:middle line:10%
it is when someone
believes that they've

01:15:19.330 --> 01:15:21.800 align:middle line:10%
walked into a human
body at a certain age.

01:15:21.800 --> 01:15:24.970 align:middle line:10%
But they didn't they
didn't experience up

01:15:24.970 --> 01:15:27.323 align:middle line:10%
to that point, a human life.

01:15:27.323 --> 01:15:28.990 align:middle line:10%
So in other words,
they may feel they've

01:15:28.990 --> 01:15:32.710 align:middle line:10%
walked into a body of a
14-year-old or a 20-year-old,

01:15:32.710 --> 01:15:34.930 align:middle line:10%
and they will feel
completely different.

01:15:34.930 --> 01:15:36.940 align:middle line:10%
And what they
explained to me is,

01:15:36.940 --> 01:15:38.500 align:middle line:10%
there will be a
soul that is in that

01:15:38.500 --> 01:15:41.410 align:middle line:10%
body for a number of
years, may have achieved

01:15:41.410 --> 01:15:42.640 align:middle line:10%
what it needed to achieve.

01:15:42.640 --> 01:15:45.405 align:middle line:84%
And rather than vacate
the body and lose it,

01:15:45.405 --> 01:15:47.530 align:middle line:84%
they'll have a soul agreement,
so another soul will

01:15:47.530 --> 01:15:51.400 align:middle line:84%
come in and take over that body
and the other soul will leave.

01:15:51.400 --> 01:15:54.640 align:middle line:84%
And their feeling is,
they have the memories,

01:15:54.640 --> 01:15:57.977 align:middle line:84%
but no attachment to them at
all, because it's not them.

01:15:57.977 --> 01:15:59.560 align:middle line:84%
Even though they'll
have the memories,

01:15:59.560 --> 01:16:00.852 align:middle line:90%
that will feel quite different.

01:16:00.852 --> 01:16:02.930 align:middle line:84%
Their focus will
be quite different.

01:16:02.930 --> 01:16:06.550 align:middle line:84%
And there's various varieties
of soul swap as well.

01:16:06.550 --> 01:16:08.590 align:middle line:84%
If I've got chance,
I'll mention it.

01:16:08.590 --> 01:16:12.390 align:middle line:84%
The reason I want you
to hear Kaza's story,

01:16:12.390 --> 01:16:17.480 align:middle line:84%
Kaza was born in Hong Kong,
but she lives in Sydney now.

01:16:17.480 --> 01:16:21.410 align:middle line:84%
Given three months to live
in this human body, in 2009

01:16:21.410 --> 01:16:24.180 align:middle line:90%
she had an autoimmune disease.

01:16:24.180 --> 01:16:27.140 align:middle line:10%
And she was told by
the doctors, go home,

01:16:27.140 --> 01:16:29.570 align:middle line:10%
there's nothing we can do.

01:16:29.570 --> 01:16:31.580 align:middle line:10%
She had a healing
by the light beings.

01:16:31.580 --> 01:16:33.740 align:middle line:10%
There was a bright light
and symbols in her head

01:16:33.740 --> 01:16:37.010 align:middle line:10%
and with love, and
she was healed.

01:16:37.010 --> 01:16:40.910 align:middle line:10%
What happened from that time
was that it got more difficult.

01:16:40.910 --> 01:16:42.830 align:middle line:10%
She had two more children.

01:16:42.830 --> 01:16:46.040 align:middle line:10%
And then she had a fourth child.

01:16:46.040 --> 01:16:50.900 align:middle line:10%
But she had multiple near-death
experiences, multiple.

01:16:50.900 --> 01:16:53.990 align:middle line:10%
And what happened from
that was ultimately,

01:16:53.990 --> 01:17:00.620 align:middle line:10%
Kaza, the soul that was in
Kaza vacated and another soul

01:17:00.620 --> 01:17:01.430 align:middle line:10%
came in.

01:17:01.430 --> 01:17:06.130 align:middle line:10%
But this soul knew they were
from the 13th dimension.

01:17:06.130 --> 01:17:08.300 align:middle line:84%
And she explained
to me quite clearly,

01:17:08.300 --> 01:17:11.660 align:middle line:84%
that we have no form, Mary,
in the 13th dimension.

01:17:11.660 --> 01:17:13.700 align:middle line:90%
We are consciousness only.

01:17:13.700 --> 01:17:18.740 align:middle line:84%
But we need to help
the planet now advance.

01:17:18.740 --> 01:17:21.530 align:middle line:84%
And the only way that
humans are comfortable

01:17:21.530 --> 01:17:25.350 align:middle line:84%
is if we appear in a form
that they can relate to.

01:17:25.350 --> 01:17:28.130 align:middle line:84%
So her reason for
moving into that body

01:17:28.130 --> 01:17:33.230 align:middle line:84%
was so that she could teach
us more about who they are.

01:17:33.230 --> 01:17:35.550 align:middle line:90%
Her children are very different.

01:17:35.550 --> 01:17:36.720 align:middle line:90%
She's had two more children.

01:17:36.720 --> 01:17:39.260 align:middle line:84%
The second child said his
friends have golden hair

01:17:39.260 --> 01:17:41.510 align:middle line:84%
and sometimes look
like a cat or a tiger,

01:17:41.510 --> 01:17:43.293 align:middle line:84%
and he will play
and talk to them.

01:17:43.293 --> 01:17:44.960 align:middle line:84%
Every night he'll see
one of his friends

01:17:44.960 --> 01:17:47.030 align:middle line:84%
pick him up and
send him to school.

01:17:47.030 --> 01:17:49.633 align:middle line:84%
The school is like
"Star Wars" school.

01:17:49.633 --> 01:17:51.050 align:middle line:84%
Kids there learn
different things,

01:17:51.050 --> 01:17:54.050 align:middle line:84%
like healing with crystals
or work with energy.

01:17:54.050 --> 01:17:57.800 align:middle line:10%
And she said the thing that she
said about the 13th dimension,

01:17:57.800 --> 01:17:59.720 align:middle line:10%
is a place full of compassion.

01:17:59.720 --> 01:18:00.570 align:middle line:10%
In that dimension.

01:18:00.570 --> 01:18:01.770 align:middle line:10%
I'm just a light form.

01:18:01.770 --> 01:18:03.770 align:middle line:10%
I don't have a name or body.

01:18:03.770 --> 01:18:05.240 align:middle line:10%
My kind do not have bodies.

01:18:05.240 --> 01:18:06.950 align:middle line:10%
We are like a block
of energy and can

01:18:06.950 --> 01:18:10.460 align:middle line:10%
turn into any form
you project onto us.

01:18:10.460 --> 01:18:12.620 align:middle line:10%
All dimensions and souls
are linked together.

01:18:12.620 --> 01:18:14.596 align:middle line:90%
>> My name is Ben.

01:18:14.596 --> 01:18:16.572 align:middle line:90%
I'm nine years old.

01:18:16.572 --> 01:18:22.190 align:middle line:84%
And I, I'm going to tell you
souls my special abilities

01:18:22.190 --> 01:18:23.144 align:middle line:90%
that I can do.

01:18:23.144 --> 01:18:27.580 align:middle line:84%
One of my abilities is to
see with my eyes closed.

01:18:27.580 --> 01:18:30.490 align:middle line:84%
And the other one is to
see through other people.

01:18:30.490 --> 01:18:35.000 align:middle line:10%
And the other one is
to go out of my body

01:18:35.000 --> 01:18:37.890 align:middle line:10%
to protect other
people from demons.

01:18:37.890 --> 01:18:40.460 align:middle line:90%
And here is some.

01:18:40.460 --> 01:18:42.460 align:middle line:84%
>> I'll tell you more
about that if I have time,

01:18:42.460 --> 01:18:44.710 align:middle line:84%
but that's all I can
show you for the moment.

01:18:44.710 --> 01:18:47.560 align:middle line:84%
What he told me was, that he
was taught by these beings

01:18:47.560 --> 01:18:49.840 align:middle line:90%
how to deal with lower entities.

01:18:49.840 --> 01:18:51.220 align:middle line:90%
And he said it wasn't scary.

01:18:51.220 --> 01:18:53.845 align:middle line:10%
They were just teaching me what
to do, so that I now can go out

01:18:53.845 --> 01:18:57.040 align:middle line:10%
at night and I can deal
with children that are being

01:18:57.040 --> 01:18:59.470 align:middle line:10%
influenced by these beings
and I can sort them out,

01:18:59.470 --> 01:19:02.050 align:middle line:10%
because I was
taught how to do it.

01:19:02.050 --> 01:19:05.500 align:middle line:84%
>> Ben, can you tell me what the
difference is between Strader

01:19:05.500 --> 01:19:08.230 align:middle line:84%
and Pumpkin Planet
that you talk about?

01:19:08.230 --> 01:19:15.790 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, there, well, Pumpkin
Planet is smaller in size

01:19:15.790 --> 01:19:19.030 align:middle line:90%
compared to Strader.

01:19:19.030 --> 01:19:24.430 align:middle line:84%
And Pumpkin Planet
doesn't have any trees.

01:19:24.430 --> 01:19:26.260 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah?

01:19:26.260 --> 01:19:29.430 align:middle line:90%
Are they on the same dimensions?

01:19:29.430 --> 01:19:32.310 align:middle line:90%
>> No.

01:19:32.310 --> 01:19:35.430 align:middle line:84%
Strader's on the
seventh dimension,

01:19:35.430 --> 01:19:38.923 align:middle line:84%
and Pumpkin Planet's
on the sixth.

01:19:38.923 --> 01:19:40.465 align:middle line:10%
>> I won't show you
any more of that,

01:19:40.465 --> 01:19:43.480 align:middle line:10%
because I've got some
more I have to show you.

01:19:43.480 --> 01:19:45.280 align:middle line:10%
The new human.

01:19:45.280 --> 01:19:47.360 align:middle line:10%
It's not so simple
as foreign DNA.

01:19:47.360 --> 01:19:49.450 align:middle line:10%
It's a combination of
genetically improved bodies

01:19:49.450 --> 01:19:51.760 align:middle line:10%
in combination with souls
from different places

01:19:51.760 --> 01:19:54.970 align:middle line:10%
in the universe incarnating
in these improved bodies.

01:19:54.970 --> 01:19:57.573 align:middle line:10%
This is Dr. Ohlson's
understanding.

01:19:57.573 --> 01:19:59.740 align:middle line:10%
The souls have different
frequencies and vibrations,

01:19:59.740 --> 01:20:01.450 align:middle line:10%
depending on their
evolutionary status.

01:20:01.450 --> 01:20:03.940 align:middle line:10%
That plays a role
inactivation of the DNA

01:20:03.940 --> 01:20:05.500 align:middle line:10%
of that particular body.

01:20:05.500 --> 01:20:07.660 align:middle line:10%
I believe we also have
to take into account

01:20:07.660 --> 01:20:09.880 align:middle line:10%
the collective soul
of Homo sapiens.

01:20:09.880 --> 01:20:12.110 align:middle line:90%
This is where we're going.

01:20:12.110 --> 01:20:14.380 align:middle line:84%
So I understood something
was going to change soon.

01:20:14.380 --> 01:20:18.220 align:middle line:84%
So this is the big message I'm
getting from so many people

01:20:18.220 --> 01:20:20.650 align:middle line:90%
across the globe.

01:20:20.650 --> 01:20:24.150 align:middle line:84%
That we're being guided
and they're organizing us.

01:20:24.150 --> 01:20:25.700 align:middle line:90%
OK?

01:20:25.700 --> 01:20:28.930 align:middle line:90%
How can we now quantify it?

01:20:28.930 --> 01:20:31.270 align:middle line:84%
I've been part of an
organization that is looking

01:20:31.270 --> 01:20:32.620 align:middle line:90%
at what this really means.

01:20:32.620 --> 01:20:35.290 align:middle line:84%
And it's the first time
we've had a survey that

01:20:35.290 --> 01:20:38.230 align:middle line:84%
is complex enough
and detailed enough

01:20:38.230 --> 01:20:40.900 align:middle line:90%
to give us some understanding.

01:20:40.900 --> 01:20:44.920 align:middle line:84%
And the new human, 51%
believe they are an ET or part

01:20:44.920 --> 01:20:49.590 align:middle line:90%
ET out of 4,200 people.

01:20:49.590 --> 01:20:54.970 align:middle line:84%
26% have information
about upgrading DNA.

01:20:54.970 --> 01:21:00.700 align:middle line:84%
41.42% believe they're part
of a genetic breeding program.

01:21:00.700 --> 01:21:03.820 align:middle line:84%
24% told their spirit
or soul was at one time

01:21:03.820 --> 01:21:05.830 align:middle line:90%
an extraterrestrial.

01:21:05.830 --> 01:21:10.940 align:middle line:84%
28% saw hybrid
ETs on spacecraft.

01:21:10.940 --> 01:21:16.330 align:middle line:84%
And 63.45% believe they
had ET hybrid children.

01:21:16.330 --> 01:21:20.580 align:middle line:84%
This is now the information
that we're getting.

01:21:20.580 --> 01:21:23.340 align:middle line:84%
This gentleman, one of the
things I wanted to show you,

01:21:23.340 --> 01:21:25.725 align:middle line:84%
was a lot of them that
are having contact

01:21:25.725 --> 01:21:27.870 align:middle line:84%
are now drawing the
beings and what have you.

01:21:27.870 --> 01:21:31.200 align:middle line:84%
And this particular
gentleman, artist,

01:21:31.200 --> 01:21:34.080 align:middle line:84%
is talking about
his own activation

01:21:34.080 --> 01:21:38.370 align:middle line:84%
of sightings, downloads of data,
spiritual practice, channeling.

01:21:38.370 --> 01:21:42.300 align:middle line:84%
And those with ET experiences,
after near-death experiences,

01:21:42.300 --> 01:21:45.190 align:middle line:84%
out-of-body experiences
and connection.

01:21:45.190 --> 01:21:47.857 align:middle line:84%
>> One of the things that's been
particularly interesting to me.

01:21:47.857 --> 01:21:48.657 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes

01:21:48.657 --> 01:21:49.690 align:middle line:90%
>> In terms of the soul.

01:21:49.690 --> 01:21:50.490 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

01:21:50.490 --> 01:21:54.570 align:middle line:10%
>> And there's been some of the
children and some of the adults

01:21:54.570 --> 01:21:57.120 align:middle line:10%
that are very aware that
when they go up on the craft,

01:21:57.120 --> 01:22:01.615 align:middle line:10%
sometimes they'll inhabit
a non-human form while

01:22:01.615 --> 01:22:02.490 align:middle line:10%
they're on the craft.

01:22:02.490 --> 01:22:03.290 align:middle line:10%
>> OK.

01:22:03.290 --> 01:22:07.135 align:middle line:10%
>> That one little boy mentioned
he evaporated into the Mantis

01:22:07.135 --> 01:22:08.350 align:middle line:10%
form, for example.

01:22:08.350 --> 01:22:09.390 align:middle line:10%
>> Yes, yes.

01:22:09.390 --> 01:22:11.250 align:middle line:10%
>> Is this something
you've experienced?

01:22:11.250 --> 01:22:13.240 align:middle line:10%
To go into another
container for a while?

01:22:13.240 --> 01:22:14.040 align:middle line:10%
>> Yes.

01:22:14.040 --> 01:22:16.080 align:middle line:10%
My astral body is not human.

01:22:16.080 --> 01:22:18.750 align:middle line:10%
It's an Ezoni.

01:22:18.750 --> 01:22:22.320 align:middle line:10%
It's something to
do with a frame,

01:22:22.320 --> 01:22:25.390 align:middle line:10%
it's kind of like a live
favoritism in a way.

01:22:25.390 --> 01:22:29.040 align:middle line:10%
Like your soul remembers this,
and it wants to duplicate it

01:22:29.040 --> 01:22:32.110 align:middle line:10%
and just wants to keep it there.

01:22:32.110 --> 01:22:33.925 align:middle line:10%
It's something that
I've chosen as well,

01:22:33.925 --> 01:22:35.550 align:middle line:10%
but something that
like, this is right.

01:22:35.550 --> 01:22:37.290 align:middle line:10%
This is what's supposed to be.

01:22:37.290 --> 01:22:39.930 align:middle line:10%
And every time I travel,
I'm always in my Ezoni.

01:22:39.930 --> 01:22:41.140 align:middle line:10%
I look Ezoni.

01:22:41.140 --> 01:22:42.742 align:middle line:10%
I'm purplish skin, you know.

01:22:42.742 --> 01:22:44.450 align:middle line:10%
>> Have you got the
picture of the Ezoni?

01:22:44.450 --> 01:22:45.750 align:middle line:10%
>> Yes, I do.

01:22:45.750 --> 01:22:47.460 align:middle line:10%
I'll show.

01:22:47.460 --> 01:22:49.218 align:middle line:10%
>> So she chooses an Ezoni form.

01:22:49.218 --> 01:22:51.510 align:middle line:10%
And if I have a minute, I'll
tell you a little bit more

01:22:51.510 --> 01:22:52.560 align:middle line:10%
about that story.

01:22:52.560 --> 01:22:54.840 align:middle line:10%
But Lea is now a
bit older, and she's

01:22:54.840 --> 01:22:56.700 align:middle line:10%
written a book called
"The Soul Remembers."

01:22:56.700 --> 01:22:59.490 align:middle line:10%
And it's all about her
memories of her past lives

01:22:59.490 --> 01:23:00.870 align:middle line:10%
in different existences.

01:23:00.870 --> 01:23:03.150 align:middle line:84%
And she's the most
amazing artist.

01:23:03.150 --> 01:23:06.930 align:middle line:84%
But I want you to, if I have
a chance, I'll mention that,

01:23:06.930 --> 01:23:09.970 align:middle line:84%
but I know I'm
running out of time.

01:23:09.970 --> 01:23:12.480 align:middle line:84%
This nine year old,
and the statement

01:23:12.480 --> 01:23:15.540 align:middle line:90%
was from this nine year old.

01:23:15.540 --> 01:23:17.910 align:middle line:84%
"My ET guides teach me
different knowledge,

01:23:17.910 --> 01:23:22.500 align:middle line:84%
so I can teach adults
to help humanity awaken.

01:23:22.500 --> 01:23:25.680 align:middle line:84%
These new children, these
new generations coming in,

01:23:25.680 --> 01:23:28.950 align:middle line:84%
are all part of this
upgrade human that's here

01:23:28.950 --> 01:23:32.280 align:middle line:90%
to help us with this planet.

01:23:32.280 --> 01:23:34.950 align:middle line:84%
And this is why we really
do need to know about it

01:23:34.950 --> 01:23:37.590 align:middle line:90%
and take care of them."

01:23:37.590 --> 01:23:39.030 align:middle line:90%
And let me explain.

01:23:39.030 --> 01:23:41.730 align:middle line:84%
Lea Kapiteli, her
mother is a scientist

01:23:41.730 --> 01:23:43.980 align:middle line:84%
who really struggled
with her daughter talking

01:23:43.980 --> 01:23:47.670 align:middle line:84%
about coming from somewhere
else, talking about past lives.

01:23:47.670 --> 01:23:49.950 align:middle line:84%
And said to me, you
know, I believe her,

01:23:49.950 --> 01:23:53.170 align:middle line:84%
but I'm really struggling,
I'm a scientist.

01:23:53.170 --> 01:23:56.290 align:middle line:84%
What Lee also said, and I
might have it in the one

01:23:56.290 --> 01:23:58.000 align:middle line:84%
that I'm going to
show you tomorrow,

01:23:58.000 --> 01:24:01.960 align:middle line:84%
is Lee talking about Homo
novus, where we are going to be

01:24:01.960 --> 01:24:05.270 align:middle line:84%
and what we are going to
be, the cosmic agenda.

01:24:05.270 --> 01:24:07.640 align:middle line:84%
So I want to
briefly say what Lea

01:24:07.640 --> 01:24:10.260 align:middle line:90%
thinks the cosmic agenda is.

01:24:10.260 --> 01:24:13.100 align:middle line:84%
"Homo novus is here
so humanity survives.

01:24:13.100 --> 01:24:17.540 align:middle line:84%
We're being upgraded
to Homo Noeticus.

01:24:17.540 --> 01:24:20.890 align:middle line:84%
We are a species in
transition to another level.

01:24:20.890 --> 01:24:23.300 align:middle line:84%
Homo novus is trying
to wake us up.

01:24:23.300 --> 01:24:28.040 align:middle line:84%
Wake up humanity through
drawings, music, sacred sites.

01:24:28.040 --> 01:24:31.340 align:middle line:84%
All those born after
2000 are Homo Noeticus.

01:24:31.340 --> 01:24:33.020 align:middle line:84%
They are literally
the next step.

01:24:33.020 --> 01:24:36.690 align:middle line:84%
They are able to do things that
Homo sapiens never dreamed of.

01:24:36.690 --> 01:24:39.950 align:middle line:84%
And many are activated in
their pubescent years."

01:24:39.950 --> 01:24:45.730 align:middle line:84%
So this is what she's
saying from 2000.

01:24:45.730 --> 01:24:48.730 align:middle line:90%
This is how they behave.

01:24:48.730 --> 01:24:53.020 align:middle line:84%
This five year old put
this together himself.

01:24:53.020 --> 01:24:58.540 align:middle line:84%
The mother literally just
came across him meditating.

01:24:58.540 --> 01:25:01.015 align:middle line:84%
I never taught my
son meditation,

01:25:01.015 --> 01:25:04.450 align:middle line:84%
but my son placed a pyramid
and crystals in a configuration

01:25:04.450 --> 01:25:05.435 align:middle line:90%
in front of him.

01:25:05.435 --> 01:25:07.060 align:middle line:84%
He said that each
corner of the pyramid

01:25:07.060 --> 01:25:09.250 align:middle line:90%
represented specific feelings.

01:25:09.250 --> 01:25:11.830 align:middle line:10%
He placed a clear
quartz crystal bead ball

01:25:11.830 --> 01:25:15.100 align:middle line:10%
on the point of the pyramid
and said it represents love,

01:25:15.100 --> 01:25:17.470 align:middle line:10%
and said that it was
what he was focusing on

01:25:17.470 --> 01:25:20.590 align:middle line:10%
during his meditation.

01:25:20.590 --> 01:25:23.980 align:middle line:10%
Twelve new groups of human,
Dr. Ohlson, has been told,

01:25:23.980 --> 01:25:25.612 align:middle line:10%
"if my information
is downloaded,

01:25:25.612 --> 01:25:27.070 align:middle line:10%
the download is
correct, there will

01:25:27.070 --> 01:25:30.400 align:middle line:10%
be 12 different main
groups of new DNA people.

01:25:30.400 --> 01:25:32.560 align:middle line:10%
It corresponds to the
12 different main groups

01:25:32.560 --> 01:25:36.370 align:middle line:10%
of ET alien DNA donors,
so nine more to go.

01:25:36.370 --> 01:25:38.710 align:middle line:10%
I do wonder what their
different features will be,

01:25:38.710 --> 01:25:41.110 align:middle line:10%
and if they'll be
allowed to go public.

01:25:41.110 --> 01:25:44.650 align:middle line:10%
Their / our DNA is activated
mainly via remote control

01:25:44.650 --> 01:25:47.590 align:middle line:10%
frequencies, so it's like
putting a virus in the software

01:25:47.590 --> 01:25:48.960 align:middle line:10%
computer program.

01:25:48.960 --> 01:25:51.460 align:middle line:84%
And when they're using their
DNA, as long as they are alive,

01:25:51.460 --> 01:25:53.230 align:middle line:84%
they will give off
an energy pattern

01:25:53.230 --> 01:25:54.880 align:middle line:84%
that will spread to
their surroundings

01:25:54.880 --> 01:25:58.570 align:middle line:84%
almost like flu or GMO
genes that contaminate

01:25:58.570 --> 01:26:00.040 align:middle line:90%
their frequency patterns."

01:26:00.040 --> 01:26:02.920 align:middle line:84%
So every person that's
woken up, every person that

01:26:02.920 --> 01:26:07.687 align:middle line:84%
is taking on these codes is
activating those around them.

01:26:07.687 --> 01:26:09.520 align:middle line:84%
There will be change
in human consciousness.

01:26:09.520 --> 01:26:12.520 align:middle line:84%
The energy heading this way
and the essence of this energy

01:26:12.520 --> 01:26:13.330 align:middle line:90%
is light.

01:26:13.330 --> 01:26:16.570 align:middle line:10%
The energy will repair our
DNA, will make us complete

01:26:16.570 --> 01:26:18.320 align:middle line:10%
and who we really are.

01:26:18.320 --> 01:26:20.260 align:middle line:10%
And this is what I
was trying to tell

01:26:20.260 --> 01:26:23.050 align:middle line:10%
my mother at four years old.

01:26:23.050 --> 01:26:25.930 align:middle line:10%
Mike Oram is author of "Does
It Rain in Other Dimensions,"

01:26:25.930 --> 01:26:27.380 align:middle line:10%
who I know in England.

01:26:27.380 --> 01:26:28.930 align:middle line:10%
He's a lovely gentleman.

01:26:28.930 --> 01:26:32.137 align:middle line:84%
And this is what he said
to his mother in the '50s,

01:26:32.137 --> 01:26:33.220 align:middle line:90%
he was talking about then.

01:26:33.220 --> 01:26:35.020 align:middle line:84%
The lovely, the
amazing artwork is

01:26:35.020 --> 01:26:37.150 align:middle line:84%
by Lloyd Canning,
who was kind enough

01:26:37.150 --> 01:26:39.520 align:middle line:90%
to do the cover of my book.

01:26:39.520 --> 01:26:41.410 align:middle line:90%
Another drawing by Lloyd.

01:26:41.410 --> 01:26:45.020 align:middle line:84%
The world is a fractal of
light, the future is bright.

01:26:45.020 --> 01:26:47.590 align:middle line:84%
A shift in energy
to a golden age.

01:26:47.590 --> 01:26:51.850 align:middle line:84%
The shift begins in June
2020, age of Aquarius,

01:26:51.850 --> 01:26:53.350 align:middle line:90%
according to Jimmy.

01:26:53.350 --> 01:26:54.940 align:middle line:90%
This is what he's been told.

01:26:54.940 --> 01:26:58.030 align:middle line:84%
So I thought I
would put that in.

01:26:58.030 --> 01:27:01.420 align:middle line:84%
"You don't have to worry,
Nana, they're guiding us home."

01:27:01.420 --> 01:27:04.080 align:middle line:84%
So this little eight year old
was saying to her grandma.

01:27:04.080 --> 01:27:07.230 align:middle line:90%


01:27:07.230 --> 01:27:13.290 align:middle line:84%
85% of experiences in our
surveys of 4,200 people

01:27:13.290 --> 01:27:18.940 align:middle line:84%
experienced a psycho-spiritual
transformation after contact.

01:27:18.940 --> 01:27:23.220 align:middle line:10%
So what is it they're
telling you off the agenda?

01:27:23.220 --> 01:27:24.785 align:middle line:10%
It sounds pretty good to me.

01:27:24.785 --> 01:27:26.160 align:middle line:84%
As I've got two
minutes, you know

01:27:26.160 --> 01:27:28.500 align:middle line:84%
I was talking about
the Ezoni and Lea.

01:27:28.500 --> 01:27:29.760 align:middle line:90%
Her mother's a scientist.

01:27:29.760 --> 01:27:32.340 align:middle line:84%
Well, Lee had drawn
a picture of the time

01:27:32.340 --> 01:27:34.380 align:middle line:90%
she was on the planet Ezoni.

01:27:34.380 --> 01:27:36.090 align:middle line:90%
And in it is all these children.

01:27:36.090 --> 01:27:39.700 align:middle line:84%
And Lea said to her mother,
these were my children

01:27:39.700 --> 01:27:40.500 align:middle line:90%
on that planet.

01:27:40.500 --> 01:27:43.480 align:middle line:84%
And you were there, and you
looked after them when I died.

01:27:43.480 --> 01:27:45.480 align:middle line:84%
And the mother could
never, the mother scientist

01:27:45.480 --> 01:27:48.480 align:middle line:84%
couldn't understand why she
was so moved by this picture,

01:27:48.480 --> 01:27:50.490 align:middle line:84%
even though she couldn't
remember anything

01:27:50.490 --> 01:27:52.115 align:middle line:84%
and didn't even know
whether she really

01:27:52.115 --> 01:27:53.940 align:middle line:90%
believed in reincarnation.

01:27:53.940 --> 01:27:56.785 align:middle line:84%
So we did a regression
with Lea sitting there,

01:27:56.785 --> 01:27:58.410 align:middle line:84%
and there was lots
of interesting stuff

01:27:58.410 --> 01:28:00.630 align:middle line:84%
that came out with
the scientist mother.

01:28:00.630 --> 01:28:03.120 align:middle line:84%
But the thing that blew
me away and something

01:28:03.120 --> 01:28:07.680 align:middle line:84%
that I think was quite profound
in validating reincarnation

01:28:07.680 --> 01:28:12.240 align:middle line:84%
more than anything, was
that in the hypnosis,

01:28:12.240 --> 01:28:16.500 align:middle line:84%
she was interacting again with
these children, these Ezoni

01:28:16.500 --> 01:28:19.680 align:middle line:84%
children that her,
that she'd been left

01:28:19.680 --> 01:28:21.990 align:middle line:90%
to look after on this planet.

01:28:21.990 --> 01:28:23.880 align:middle line:84%
But she said, they're
talking to me,

01:28:23.880 --> 01:28:26.400 align:middle line:90%
but I can't understand them.

01:28:26.400 --> 01:28:28.320 align:middle line:84%
And Lea, who had been
sitting there watching

01:28:28.320 --> 01:28:31.635 align:middle line:84%
the hypnosis, and normally
this would never happen,

01:28:31.635 --> 01:28:33.510 align:middle line:84%
but she kept saying, I
want to say something,

01:28:33.510 --> 01:28:35.290 align:middle line:90%
I want to say something.

01:28:35.290 --> 01:28:38.580 align:middle line:84%
So I thought, OK, we'll
see what pans out.

01:28:38.580 --> 01:28:43.840 align:middle line:84%
And Lea spoke to her mother
in hypnosis in Ezoni.

01:28:43.840 --> 01:28:46.093 align:middle line:90%
And guess what happened.

01:28:46.093 --> 01:28:47.510 align:middle line:84%
The mother answered
back in Ezoni.

01:28:47.510 --> 01:28:50.603 align:middle line:90%


01:28:50.603 --> 01:28:52.270 align:middle line:84%
And when she came out
of the regression,
