00:00:03.290 --> 00:00:06.120 align:middle line:90%


00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:09.000 align:middle line:84%
>> Ladies and gentlemen, put
your hands together and give

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:13.693 align:middle line:84%
a wonderful warm
welcome to Gregg Braden.

00:00:13.693 --> 00:00:19.370 align:middle line:90%
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:19.370 --> 00:00:20.740 align:middle line:90%
>> It's been way too long --

00:00:20.740 --> 00:00:21.680 align:middle line:90%
>> It really has been.

00:00:21.680 --> 00:00:22.150 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:00:22.150 --> 00:00:22.950 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:00:22.950 --> 00:00:25.910 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:27.790 align:middle line:90%
Wow.

00:00:27.790 --> 00:00:29.570 align:middle line:90%
Thank you all so much.

00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:30.370 align:middle line:90%
Thank you, Shima.

00:00:30.370 --> 00:00:34.420 align:middle line:84%
We used to do that years
ago, and then we stopped.

00:00:34.420 --> 00:00:36.250 align:middle line:84%
And thank you for
starting again.

00:00:36.250 --> 00:00:41.380 align:middle line:84%
She said I'm her first
for this conference.

00:00:41.380 --> 00:00:44.500 align:middle line:10%
So are you as happy
to be in this room

00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:46.750 align:middle line:10%
right now as I am to be
in this room right now?

00:00:46.750 --> 00:00:47.550 align:middle line:10%
I don't know.

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:51.170 align:middle line:90%


00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:51.970 align:middle line:90%
Wow.

00:00:51.970 --> 00:00:57.070 align:middle line:84%
I want to say welcome to
Conscious Life Expo 2020.

00:00:57.070 --> 00:01:00.640 align:middle line:84%
Can you wrap your
brain around 2020?

00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:02.860 align:middle line:84%
Remember when you were
kids and 2020 seemed

00:01:02.860 --> 00:01:04.940 align:middle line:90%
like a lifetime in the future?

00:01:04.940 --> 00:01:05.922 align:middle line:90%
Remember that?

00:01:05.922 --> 00:01:06.880 align:middle line:90%
Here's what I remember.

00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:10.630 align:middle line:84%
I remember-- do y'all remember
2012, how weird that was?

00:01:10.630 --> 00:01:15.352 align:middle line:84%
I remember 2012, and people
asking me, and a lot of them

00:01:15.352 --> 00:01:16.810 align:middle line:84%
were some of the
radio interviewers

00:01:16.810 --> 00:01:18.958 align:middle line:90%
that were less than friendly.

00:01:18.958 --> 00:01:20.500 align:middle line:84%
The radio interviews,
they would say,

00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:23.050 align:middle line:84%
when is this change
everybody's talking about,

00:01:23.050 --> 00:01:25.150 align:middle line:90%
when's it going to begin?

00:01:25.150 --> 00:01:26.800 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, well, those
interviewers now

00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:30.160 align:middle line:84%
are asking me, when's
it going to stop?

00:01:30.160 --> 00:01:32.950 align:middle line:84%
I'm telling them-- I say,
man, we have just started.

00:01:32.950 --> 00:01:34.060 align:middle line:90%
We're just beginning.

00:01:34.060 --> 00:01:35.470 align:middle line:90%
Can you feel this world?

00:01:35.470 --> 00:01:38.440 align:middle line:84%
Can you feel this
world's on fire?

00:01:38.440 --> 00:01:39.370 align:middle line:90%
Can you feel that?

00:01:39.370 --> 00:01:41.800 align:middle line:84%
Let me-- I just want to
ask you, how many of you

00:01:41.800 --> 00:01:45.230 align:middle line:84%
feel like there's a really
beautiful world emerging?

00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:46.030 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:01:46.030 --> 00:01:49.540 align:middle line:90%
I feel that as well.

00:01:49.540 --> 00:01:53.170 align:middle line:84%
If you did not watch
the opinions of people

00:01:53.170 --> 00:01:55.780 align:middle line:84%
who were paid to give you
opinions on mainstream media,

00:01:55.780 --> 00:01:57.880 align:middle line:84%
you would not think
that the world

00:01:57.880 --> 00:02:02.110 align:middle line:84%
is in such a bad place or any
nation is in such a bad place.

00:02:02.110 --> 00:02:03.850 align:middle line:84%
It's really, really
interesting for me.

00:02:03.850 --> 00:02:07.750 align:middle line:84%
I was-- I had a thought coming
down the elevator today.

00:02:07.750 --> 00:02:10.130 align:middle line:84%
I believe this world is
going to be here a long time,

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:14.170 align:middle line:84%
but if for some reason the
world ended like today,

00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:16.330 align:middle line:84%
wouldn't this
conference, wouldn't this

00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:19.522 align:middle line:84%
be an awesome group of people
to start a new world with?

00:02:19.522 --> 00:02:20.355 align:middle line:90%
I mean, wouldn't it?

00:02:20.355 --> 00:02:23.170 align:middle line:90%


00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:27.370 align:middle line:84%
I mean, think about
all of the knowledge

00:02:27.370 --> 00:02:31.630 align:middle line:84%
and the wisdom and the insights
from so many different walks

00:02:31.630 --> 00:02:34.300 align:middle line:84%
of life, from
agriculture and child

00:02:34.300 --> 00:02:37.030 align:middle line:84%
bearing and family and
science and technology

00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:38.590 align:middle line:90%
and spirituality.

00:02:38.590 --> 00:02:40.090 align:middle line:90%
Actually, here's what happened.

00:02:40.090 --> 00:02:41.890 align:middle line:84%
I was just in the back
room of the hotel.

00:02:41.890 --> 00:02:44.390 align:middle line:84%
And the hotel manager came down
and gave me a little secret.

00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:45.848 align:middle line:84%
He said, this isn't
really a hotel.

00:02:45.848 --> 00:02:47.140 align:middle line:90%
It's a pod.

00:02:47.140 --> 00:02:49.390 align:middle line:84%
It's a ship
disguised as a hotel.

00:02:49.390 --> 00:02:52.270 align:middle line:84%
So if something
happens, we have the way

00:02:52.270 --> 00:02:56.030 align:middle line:84%
to preserve humankind's
knowledge for the--

00:02:56.030 --> 00:02:56.830 align:middle line:90%
I'm just kidding.

00:02:56.830 --> 00:02:57.560 align:middle line:90%
I'm just kidding.

00:02:57.560 --> 00:02:58.360 align:middle line:90%
I'm just kidding.

00:02:58.360 --> 00:02:59.990 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:02:59.990 --> 00:03:01.240 align:middle line:90%
So I want to say hello to you.

00:03:01.240 --> 00:03:03.213 align:middle line:84%
And we are streaming
live to planet Earth.

00:03:03.213 --> 00:03:05.380 align:middle line:84%
So I'm going to say hello
to all the people watching

00:03:05.380 --> 00:03:06.180 align:middle line:90%
on our streaming.

00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:08.230 align:middle line:84%
Please welcome all of
our people streaming.

00:03:08.230 --> 00:03:12.110 align:middle line:84%
We've got a global
family out there.

00:03:12.110 --> 00:03:14.380 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:03:14.380 --> 00:03:16.930 align:middle line:84%
And right down the
hall behind a secret

00:03:16.930 --> 00:03:21.570 align:middle line:84%
closed door deep in the bowels
of the hidden bunker, there--

00:03:21.570 --> 00:03:24.180 align:middle line:84%
I don't know where
that came from.

00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:25.180 align:middle line:90%
That's on the airwaves.

00:03:25.180 --> 00:03:29.140 align:middle line:84%
There is a control
room run by Gaia.

00:03:29.140 --> 00:03:33.340 align:middle line:84%
And Gaia is working very,
very diligently to record,

00:03:33.340 --> 00:03:35.920 align:middle line:84%
to share this information,
to stream it live.

00:03:35.920 --> 00:03:37.420 align:middle line:84%
And they've worked
behind the scenes

00:03:37.420 --> 00:03:38.795 align:middle line:84%
to put this whole
thing together.

00:03:38.795 --> 00:03:40.750 align:middle line:84%
So if you haven't
already, please help me

00:03:40.750 --> 00:03:43.290 align:middle line:84%
give them a warm welcome
and deep gratitude.

00:03:43.290 --> 00:03:44.180 align:middle line:90%
Gaia, we love you.

00:03:44.180 --> 00:03:46.305 align:middle line:84%
Thank you so much for
everything that you're doing.

00:03:46.305 --> 00:03:47.315 align:middle line:90%
You guys are awesome.

00:03:47.315 --> 00:03:49.510 align:middle line:90%


00:03:49.510 --> 00:03:50.310 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:03:50.310 --> 00:03:52.060 align:middle line:84%
And while I'm talking to a
Gaia, I'm just going to ask you,

00:03:52.060 --> 00:03:53.520 align:middle line:84%
don't zoom in too
close on my face.

00:03:53.520 --> 00:03:54.320 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:03:54.320 --> 00:03:55.903 align:middle line:84%
It just doesn't work
doesn't work out.

00:03:55.903 --> 00:03:58.900 align:middle line:90%


00:03:58.900 --> 00:04:01.400 align:middle line:84%
If you've ever been on camera,
you know exactly what I mean,

00:04:01.400 --> 00:04:02.390 align:middle line:90%
right?

00:04:02.390 --> 00:04:04.970 align:middle line:84%
So I have been given
the opportunity--

00:04:04.970 --> 00:04:06.010 align:middle line:90%
I've got 90 minutes.

00:04:06.010 --> 00:04:08.340 align:middle line:84%
It's going to be a fast
90 minutes tonight.

00:04:08.340 --> 00:04:10.880 align:middle line:84%
I want to talk to you
about this world that's

00:04:10.880 --> 00:04:14.900 align:middle line:90%
emerging and a battle.

00:04:14.900 --> 00:04:17.070 align:middle line:84%
A battle, it is
an ultimate battle

00:04:17.070 --> 00:04:20.890 align:middle line:84%
that is playing out that
is rarely talked about.

00:04:20.890 --> 00:04:23.360 align:middle line:84%
And this is one of those
really beautiful places where

00:04:23.360 --> 00:04:28.730 align:middle line:84%
science and spirituality
and politics and policy

00:04:28.730 --> 00:04:32.660 align:middle line:84%
all come together, because it's
based on the way you and I have

00:04:32.660 --> 00:04:36.590 align:middle line:84%
been taught to think about
ourselves, about our world,

00:04:36.590 --> 00:04:40.470 align:middle line:84%
about our relationship
to the world, and beyond.

00:04:40.470 --> 00:04:43.600 align:middle line:84%
If you think about it,
this is really interesting.

00:04:43.600 --> 00:04:49.490 align:middle line:84%
Everything that we do, all
the choices that we make,

00:04:49.490 --> 00:04:52.280 align:middle line:84%
everything that we
embrace in our lives

00:04:52.280 --> 00:04:54.350 align:middle line:84%
or reject in our lives,
it's all based on the way

00:04:54.350 --> 00:04:55.910 align:middle line:90%
we've been taught to think.

00:04:55.910 --> 00:04:58.360 align:middle line:84%
So this is what I want to
talk to you about tonight.

00:04:58.360 --> 00:04:59.840 align:middle line:90%
There is an American author.

00:04:59.840 --> 00:05:00.950 align:middle line:90%
His name is Scott Turow.

00:05:00.950 --> 00:05:02.390 align:middle line:10%
And he says this so beautifully.

00:05:02.390 --> 00:05:05.120 align:middle line:10%
I'm not even going
to try to do anything

00:05:05.120 --> 00:05:06.140 align:middle line:10%
but share what he says.

00:05:06.140 --> 00:05:10.970 align:middle line:84%
He says, who are we but the
stories we tell ourselves

00:05:10.970 --> 00:05:13.010 align:middle line:90%
about ourselves?

00:05:13.010 --> 00:05:15.410 align:middle line:84%
But it's not enough to
tell yourself the story.

00:05:15.410 --> 00:05:18.380 align:middle line:84%
Who are we but the stories we
tell ourselves about ourselves

00:05:18.380 --> 00:05:19.250 align:middle line:90%
and believe?

00:05:19.250 --> 00:05:23.790 align:middle line:84%
What do you really
believe about who you are?

00:05:23.790 --> 00:05:26.090 align:middle line:84%
Not what you
consciously believe,

00:05:26.090 --> 00:05:29.000 align:middle line:84%
not what the new age and the new
thought books and the workshops

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:32.150 align:middle line:84%
and the Gregg Braden tapes and
videos tell you to believe,

00:05:32.150 --> 00:05:35.420 align:middle line:84%
but what do you really,
really believe about yourself?

00:05:35.420 --> 00:05:38.750 align:middle line:84%
And the answer to that is
the life that you've created.

00:05:38.750 --> 00:05:42.020 align:middle line:84%
Your life is reflecting to
you, it's mirroring to you

00:05:42.020 --> 00:05:44.270 align:middle line:84%
the deepest truths
of your existence.

00:05:44.270 --> 00:05:46.190 align:middle line:84%
When we learn to
read those truths,

00:05:46.190 --> 00:05:48.710 align:middle line:84%
it reveals tremendous
insights into us

00:05:48.710 --> 00:05:51.670 align:middle line:84%
and what we believe, our
relationship to our world.

00:05:51.670 --> 00:05:54.432 align:middle line:84%
So I want to talk to you
about our story, our story.

00:05:54.432 --> 00:05:55.640 align:middle line:90%
And I'm going to define this.

00:05:55.640 --> 00:05:57.680 align:middle line:84%
The story is the way
we've been taught

00:05:57.680 --> 00:06:00.440 align:middle line:90%
to think about ourselves.

00:06:00.440 --> 00:06:04.070 align:middle line:84%
From even before we were
born, your program begins.

00:06:04.070 --> 00:06:05.640 align:middle line:84%
And I think many
of you know that.

00:06:05.640 --> 00:06:07.400 align:middle line:84%
If you've ever been with
my dear friend, colleague,

00:06:07.400 --> 00:06:09.275 align:middle line:84%
spiritual brother Dr.
Bruce Lipton-- how many

00:06:09.275 --> 00:06:10.760 align:middle line:90%
you've been with Bruce?

00:06:10.760 --> 00:06:13.610 align:middle line:84%
Oh, what a beautiful
man, a good, good man.

00:06:13.610 --> 00:06:17.780 align:middle line:84%
And his course is
on prenatal training

00:06:17.780 --> 00:06:20.630 align:middle line:84%
and how the fetus actually
begins to pick up cues

00:06:20.630 --> 00:06:26.960 align:middle line:84%
from the mother and the father,
or whoever the adults are even

00:06:26.960 --> 00:06:27.950 align:middle line:90%
in the womb--

00:06:27.950 --> 00:06:32.330 align:middle line:84%
chemically, vibrationally,
acoustically, energetically.

00:06:32.330 --> 00:06:34.222 align:middle line:84%
So our story, now,
our story, I want

00:06:34.222 --> 00:06:36.680 align:middle line:84%
you to know this is more than
a philosophical conversation.

00:06:36.680 --> 00:06:38.097 align:middle line:84%
You say the word
story to someone.

00:06:38.097 --> 00:06:40.100 align:middle line:84%
You think, oh, yeah, you
know, what's a story?

00:06:40.100 --> 00:06:42.100 align:middle line:84%
It's more than just a
philosophic conversation.

00:06:42.100 --> 00:06:43.130 align:middle line:90%
We live our lives.

00:06:43.130 --> 00:06:44.213 align:middle line:90%
I'm going to get personal.

00:06:44.213 --> 00:06:46.280 align:middle line:84%
You live your life
based upon your story.

00:06:46.280 --> 00:06:47.600 align:middle line:90%
This is what I'm saying.

00:06:47.600 --> 00:06:50.630 align:middle line:84%
You solve your problems
based upon what you've been

00:06:50.630 --> 00:06:52.820 align:middle line:90%
taught to think about yourself.

00:06:52.820 --> 00:06:54.663 align:middle line:90%
You choose your relationships.

00:06:54.663 --> 00:06:55.580 align:middle line:90%
Now, think about that.

00:06:55.580 --> 00:06:59.090 align:middle line:84%
We're all having
relationships of some kind--

00:06:59.090 --> 00:07:01.680 align:middle line:84%
every marriage, every divorce,
every marriage, every divorce,

00:07:01.680 --> 00:07:04.130 align:middle line:84%
every marriage, every
divorce, every divorce.

00:07:04.130 --> 00:07:07.045 align:middle line:90%


00:07:07.045 --> 00:07:08.420 align:middle line:84%
There's a whole
workshop we could

00:07:08.420 --> 00:07:11.120 align:middle line:90%
do right there on thinking.

00:07:11.120 --> 00:07:14.720 align:middle line:90%
Note to myself, future workshop.

00:07:14.720 --> 00:07:17.300 align:middle line:84%
We choose our relationships,
our friendships

00:07:17.300 --> 00:07:18.800 align:middle line:84%
based upon the way
we've been taught

00:07:18.800 --> 00:07:20.630 align:middle line:90%
to think about ourselves.

00:07:20.630 --> 00:07:23.240 align:middle line:84%
The kind of jobs that
we feel qualified even

00:07:23.240 --> 00:07:25.438 align:middle line:90%
to consider applying for.

00:07:25.438 --> 00:07:26.480 align:middle line:90%
We're all adults in here.

00:07:26.480 --> 00:07:27.380 align:middle line:90%
I mean, think about this.

00:07:27.380 --> 00:07:29.422 align:middle line:84%
The people you invite into
your lives, the people

00:07:29.422 --> 00:07:32.300 align:middle line:84%
you invite into your bed,
it's based upon the way

00:07:32.300 --> 00:07:34.580 align:middle line:90%
that you think about yourself.

00:07:34.580 --> 00:07:37.077 align:middle line:84%
The way you heal
your body is based

00:07:37.077 --> 00:07:39.410 align:middle line:84%
upon the way you've been
taught to think about yourself.

00:07:39.410 --> 00:07:41.077 align:middle line:84%
You go to have a
physical and the doctor

00:07:41.077 --> 00:07:44.120 align:middle line:84%
says something is going on
that shouldn't be going on,

00:07:44.120 --> 00:07:47.250 align:middle line:84%
you can have all the new
thought, all the new age tools,

00:07:47.250 --> 00:07:49.932 align:middle line:84%
and your deck of
cards that you look

00:07:49.932 --> 00:07:51.890 align:middle line:84%
at first thing in the
morning, and the mushroom

00:07:51.890 --> 00:07:54.403 align:middle line:84%
drink fermenting in the
back of the refrigerator

00:07:54.403 --> 00:07:55.820 align:middle line:84%
that you drink
just before you put

00:07:55.820 --> 00:07:58.400 align:middle line:84%
on the tourmaline that takes
you through the rest of the day.

00:07:58.400 --> 00:07:59.610 align:middle line:90%
And all that can be good.

00:07:59.610 --> 00:08:01.220 align:middle line:90%
That can all be good.

00:08:01.220 --> 00:08:04.850 align:middle line:84%
But if the doctor tells
you something is not right,

00:08:04.850 --> 00:08:06.960 align:middle line:90%
where do you go emotionally?

00:08:06.960 --> 00:08:09.470 align:middle line:84%
And where do you
go psychologically?

00:08:09.470 --> 00:08:10.900 align:middle line:84%
And the answer to
that question--

00:08:10.900 --> 00:08:12.775 align:middle line:84%
there is no right or
wrong, but it tells you,

00:08:12.775 --> 00:08:15.890 align:middle line:90%
it informs you about your story.

00:08:15.890 --> 00:08:17.180 align:middle line:90%
How you heal your body.

00:08:17.180 --> 00:08:20.420 align:middle line:84%
And the world that we're
creating right now our society,

00:08:20.420 --> 00:08:22.970 align:middle line:84%
the political choices,
the laws that we're

00:08:22.970 --> 00:08:24.710 align:middle line:84%
voting into
governance, the people

00:08:24.710 --> 00:08:26.510 align:middle line:84%
that we have asked
to represent us,

00:08:26.510 --> 00:08:29.120 align:middle line:84%
it's all based on the way
we think about ourselves.

00:08:29.120 --> 00:08:31.739 align:middle line:84%
So are you starting to get
the sense that our story is

00:08:31.739 --> 00:08:32.539 align:middle line:90%
really important?

00:08:32.539 --> 00:08:34.370 align:middle line:84%
It's more than a
philosophical concept.

00:08:34.370 --> 00:08:35.330 align:middle line:90%
Can you get that?

00:08:35.330 --> 00:08:36.919 align:middle line:90%
Yes, no, audience participation.

00:08:36.919 --> 00:08:37.220 align:middle line:90%
All right.

00:08:37.220 --> 00:08:38.090 align:middle line:90%
Good.

00:08:38.090 --> 00:08:43.140 align:middle line:84%
Well, I have spent the bulk
of my adult life searching

00:08:43.140 --> 00:08:46.440 align:middle line:84%
some of the most
isolated and remote,

00:08:46.440 --> 00:08:51.000 align:middle line:84%
mysterious, pristine places
remaining in the world

00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:53.310 align:middle line:84%
today to see where our
story has come from,

00:08:53.310 --> 00:08:55.210 align:middle line:90%
our collective story.

00:08:55.210 --> 00:08:58.588 align:middle line:84%
What do our ancestors know about
us that maybe we've forgotten

00:08:58.588 --> 00:09:00.630 align:middle line:84%
or maybe that we're only
beginning to understand?

00:09:00.630 --> 00:09:02.820 align:middle line:84%
And my journey has
taken me into some

00:09:02.820 --> 00:09:05.160 align:middle line:84%
of the most amazing
places, some of the most

00:09:05.160 --> 00:09:07.680 align:middle line:84%
magnificent monasteries,
like this one in the Tibetan

00:09:07.680 --> 00:09:10.770 align:middle line:84%
Plateau, remaining
in the world today.

00:09:10.770 --> 00:09:15.720 align:middle line:84%
But it's also taken me into some
of the most humble monasteries

00:09:15.720 --> 00:09:19.620 align:middle line:84%
that you're not going to
see on Hollywood screens.

00:09:19.620 --> 00:09:23.190 align:middle line:84%
But these are the places where
those who have come before us

00:09:23.190 --> 00:09:27.900 align:middle line:84%
have stored the information
that tell them about our story--

00:09:27.900 --> 00:09:30.390 align:middle line:84%
who we are, where
we've come from,

00:09:30.390 --> 00:09:33.600 align:middle line:84%
perhaps most importantly, what
our capabilities, what our

00:09:33.600 --> 00:09:36.540 align:middle line:84%
capacities, and what our
potentials really are.

00:09:36.540 --> 00:09:38.370 align:middle line:84%
And it was in
monasteries like this.

00:09:38.370 --> 00:09:41.940 align:middle line:84%
I mean, this is a very humble
mud and brick monastery

00:09:41.940 --> 00:09:43.230 align:middle line:90%
in the Egyptian desert.

00:09:43.230 --> 00:09:44.190 align:middle line:90%
It's on Mount Sinai.

00:09:44.190 --> 00:09:45.930 align:middle line:84%
Maybe some of you
have been here.

00:09:45.930 --> 00:09:48.060 align:middle line:90%
No electricity is in here.

00:09:48.060 --> 00:09:49.762 align:middle line:90%
They all use oil.

00:09:49.762 --> 00:09:50.970 align:middle line:90%
I'm trying to think of what--

00:09:50.970 --> 00:09:53.970 align:middle line:84%
I think it's olive oil
lamps that they use.

00:09:53.970 --> 00:09:54.990 align:middle line:90%
No running water.

00:09:54.990 --> 00:09:57.060 align:middle line:84%
And you would never
guess in a million years

00:09:57.060 --> 00:09:59.460 align:middle line:84%
based on how primitive it
looks on the outside when

00:09:59.460 --> 00:10:01.195 align:middle line:90%
you walk inside--

00:10:01.195 --> 00:10:03.570 align:middle line:84%
I'm just going to show you
the first time I walked inside

00:10:03.570 --> 00:10:05.550 align:middle line:84%
of this monastery,
I was expecting

00:10:05.550 --> 00:10:08.700 align:middle line:84%
to see a dusty old room
and not even close.

00:10:08.700 --> 00:10:11.132 align:middle line:10%
This is what I saw
when I walked in there.

00:10:11.132 --> 00:10:12.090 align:middle line:10%
And that's what I said.

00:10:12.090 --> 00:10:13.590 align:middle line:10%
It's been there 1,500 years.

00:10:13.590 --> 00:10:15.510 align:middle line:10%
I said, how did they do that?

00:10:15.510 --> 00:10:18.460 align:middle line:10%
And then I realized, they
had 1,500 years to shop.

00:10:18.460 --> 00:10:23.580 align:middle line:10%
They had 1,500 years to
roam the world and decorate.

00:10:23.580 --> 00:10:26.093 align:middle line:90%
It is a Coptic monastery.

00:10:26.093 --> 00:10:28.260 align:middle line:84%
But because of-- And I want
to show you the ceiling.

00:10:28.260 --> 00:10:29.060 align:middle line:90%
Look at this.

00:10:29.060 --> 00:10:31.142 align:middle line:10%
Artisans from all
over the world came.

00:10:31.142 --> 00:10:33.600 align:middle line:84%
And when you see, what I want
you know, this isn't painted.

00:10:33.600 --> 00:10:38.580 align:middle line:84%
These are tiny parts,
pieces of minerals and glass

00:10:38.580 --> 00:10:43.230 align:middle line:84%
that are made into this mosaic
that is just unbelievable.

00:10:43.230 --> 00:10:45.570 align:middle line:84%
And I'm sharing this
with you, because if they

00:10:45.570 --> 00:10:48.090 align:middle line:84%
had this kind of technology,
it's not surprising

00:10:48.090 --> 00:10:49.697 align:middle line:90%
that they have a library.

00:10:49.697 --> 00:10:51.030 align:middle line:90%
And I want to show this library.

00:10:51.030 --> 00:10:52.363 align:middle line:90%
This is such an awesome library.

00:10:52.363 --> 00:10:53.163 align:middle line:90%
Look at it.

00:10:53.163 --> 00:10:55.210 align:middle line:84%
It looks like a Harry
Potter library, doesn't it?

00:10:55.210 --> 00:10:58.180 align:middle line:84%
And I was only allowed
in this library twice.

00:10:58.180 --> 00:10:58.980 align:middle line:10%
But it was in--

00:10:58.980 --> 00:11:01.600 align:middle line:10%
I mean, look at the spiral
staircases in there.

00:11:01.600 --> 00:11:02.400 align:middle line:10%
Beautiful.

00:11:02.400 --> 00:11:05.280 align:middle line:84%
And it's in this
library where there

00:11:05.280 --> 00:11:09.910 align:middle line:84%
are records of a wisdom that
predates the knowledge that we

00:11:09.910 --> 00:11:10.710 align:middle line:90%
have today.

00:11:10.710 --> 00:11:13.630 align:middle line:84%
It's written not in scrolls,
but in ancient texts

00:11:13.630 --> 00:11:17.430 align:middle line:84%
in many different languages
that are only now, only now

00:11:17.430 --> 00:11:18.600 align:middle line:90%
they're being translated.

00:11:18.600 --> 00:11:20.070 align:middle line:90%
And this is just one library.

00:11:20.070 --> 00:11:22.210 align:middle line:84%
And this happens
to be an in Egypt.

00:11:22.210 --> 00:11:24.780 align:middle line:10%
There are others like here.

00:11:24.780 --> 00:11:30.360 align:middle line:10%
From the late 1990s to the-- the
mid 1990s to the early 2000s,

00:11:30.360 --> 00:11:32.850 align:middle line:10%
I was privileged to lead
groups into the Tibetan

00:11:32.850 --> 00:11:34.770 align:middle line:10%
Plateau, a 26-day journey.

00:11:34.770 --> 00:11:38.850 align:middle line:10%
We cannot make them any
longer for political reasons,

00:11:38.850 --> 00:11:41.220 align:middle line:10%
but I'm glad that we did,
because while we were there,

00:11:41.220 --> 00:11:42.930 align:middle line:10%
we found places like this.

00:11:42.930 --> 00:11:46.920 align:middle line:10%
The more remote and isolated
they are, the more intact

00:11:46.920 --> 00:11:47.730 align:middle line:10%
the wisdom is.

00:11:47.730 --> 00:11:50.580 align:middle line:10%
And I think you can
see why that would be.

00:11:50.580 --> 00:11:52.387 align:middle line:10%
The monasteries that
are easy to get to,

00:11:52.387 --> 00:11:54.220 align:middle line:10%
those are the ones that
have been ransacked.

00:11:54.220 --> 00:11:57.210 align:middle line:10%
And many of them don't
exist any longer.

00:11:57.210 --> 00:11:59.070 align:middle line:10%
But it was in this
particular monastery

00:11:59.070 --> 00:12:01.920 align:middle line:10%
we had the opportunity
to see this library.

00:12:01.920 --> 00:12:04.200 align:middle line:84%
And I'm really gratified
at your response,

00:12:04.200 --> 00:12:05.520 align:middle line:90%
because that's what I said.

00:12:05.520 --> 00:12:08.100 align:middle line:90%
We walked into a dark room.

00:12:08.100 --> 00:12:10.560 align:middle line:84%
And the monk said,
wait right here.

00:12:10.560 --> 00:12:12.817 align:middle line:84%
And when he turned on the
light, this is what I saw.

00:12:12.817 --> 00:12:14.400 align:middle line:84%
This is-- I don't
know if you can see.

00:12:14.400 --> 00:12:18.280 align:middle line:10%
My hand is at the bottom of the
slide holding the flashlight up

00:12:18.280 --> 00:12:19.080 align:middle line:10%
right there.

00:12:19.080 --> 00:12:22.020 align:middle line:84%
And you're looking at the
corner of this library.

00:12:22.020 --> 00:12:25.650 align:middle line:84%
It's three stories tall,
but it's only 12 feet wide--

00:12:25.650 --> 00:12:27.720 align:middle line:90%
very narrow, very tall.

00:12:27.720 --> 00:12:29.420 align:middle line:90%
And these are Tibetan books.

00:12:29.420 --> 00:12:33.780 align:middle line:10%
There they're loose pages
sandwiched between the covers,

00:12:33.780 --> 00:12:34.890 align:middle line:10%
these wooden covers.

00:12:34.890 --> 00:12:37.620 align:middle line:84%
And when you open them,
this is what you see inside.

00:12:37.620 --> 00:12:40.980 align:middle line:84%
Each page is telling
something about us,

00:12:40.980 --> 00:12:44.040 align:middle line:84%
our story, our
relationship to the past,

00:12:44.040 --> 00:12:47.100 align:middle line:84%
our relationship to our body,
our relationship to ourselves

00:12:47.100 --> 00:12:48.490 align:middle line:90%
and one another.

00:12:48.490 --> 00:12:50.430 align:middle line:84%
And what I find
fascinating about this

00:12:50.430 --> 00:12:54.600 align:middle line:84%
is the knowledge that's
contained in these records

00:12:54.600 --> 00:12:57.150 align:middle line:84%
predates the paper that
they're written on.

00:12:57.150 --> 00:13:00.480 align:middle line:10%
You find this
knowledge in stone,

00:13:00.480 --> 00:13:02.760 align:middle line:10%
in cuneiform, ancient cuneiform.

00:13:02.760 --> 00:13:04.920 align:middle line:10%
You find it in Sanskrit.

00:13:04.920 --> 00:13:07.650 align:middle line:10%
You find it in the
ancient languages

00:13:07.650 --> 00:13:11.070 align:middle line:10%
that are called the root or the
core languages of humankind,

00:13:11.070 --> 00:13:13.500 align:middle line:10%
such as Arabic, such as Hebrew.

00:13:13.500 --> 00:13:15.930 align:middle line:10%
And those languages became--

00:13:15.930 --> 00:13:20.310 align:middle line:10%
and that knowledge became the
core of the great religions

00:13:20.310 --> 00:13:21.570 align:middle line:10%
that came later.

00:13:21.570 --> 00:13:23.730 align:middle line:10%
The knowledge came first.

00:13:23.730 --> 00:13:26.250 align:middle line:10%
The spiritual
principles came first.

00:13:26.250 --> 00:13:33.210 align:middle line:10%
The Hebrew language, the
Tibetan Buddhist traditions,

00:13:33.210 --> 00:13:36.240 align:middle line:10%
the traditional Buddhist
traditions, the Hindu

00:13:36.240 --> 00:13:39.120 align:middle line:10%
traditions, the oldest
records of the Old Testament,

00:13:39.120 --> 00:13:40.900 align:middle line:10%
the oldest records
of the New Testament,

00:13:40.900 --> 00:13:43.090 align:middle line:10%
as different as they
are from one another,

00:13:43.090 --> 00:13:45.340 align:middle line:10%
and they are very
different now, but they

00:13:45.340 --> 00:13:49.310 align:middle line:10%
stem from this common body
of knowledge about us.

00:13:49.310 --> 00:13:50.110 align:middle line:10%
Who are we?

00:13:50.110 --> 00:13:51.027 align:middle line:10%
Where do we come from?

00:13:51.027 --> 00:13:53.082 align:middle line:10%
But perhaps most
importantly, how do we

00:13:53.082 --> 00:13:54.040 align:middle line:10%
function in this world?

00:13:54.040 --> 00:13:55.750 align:middle line:10%
What are our capabilities?

00:13:55.750 --> 00:13:58.080 align:middle line:10%
What are our potentials?

00:13:58.080 --> 00:14:00.550 align:middle line:10%
And this is where our
story takes a big shift.

00:14:00.550 --> 00:14:02.770 align:middle line:10%
This is why I want to share
this with you tonight.

00:14:02.770 --> 00:14:05.740 align:middle line:10%
I have had the opportunity
to be with the people who

00:14:05.740 --> 00:14:07.690 align:middle line:10%
live what's in those
traditions, who

00:14:07.690 --> 00:14:10.490 align:middle line:10%
live what's in the monasteries
and those books, and the monks

00:14:10.490 --> 00:14:11.290 align:middle line:10%
and nuns.

00:14:11.290 --> 00:14:14.290 align:middle line:10%
This is an abbot in Tibet.

00:14:14.290 --> 00:14:17.718 align:middle line:10%
The opportunity to be with
the shamans in the Yucatan.

00:14:17.718 --> 00:14:19.510 align:middle line:10%
I'm just going to say,
this beautiful man--

00:14:19.510 --> 00:14:21.490 align:middle line:10%
I was just in the
Yucatan three weeks ago.

00:14:21.490 --> 00:14:24.135 align:middle line:10%
Maybe some of you in this
room were there with me.

00:14:24.135 --> 00:14:25.510 align:middle line:10%
And this is a
shaman I work with.

00:14:25.510 --> 00:14:26.920 align:middle line:10%
He just passed.

00:14:26.920 --> 00:14:27.730 align:middle line:10%
He just passed.

00:14:27.730 --> 00:14:29.333 align:middle line:10%
So many of the good
ones are leaving.

00:14:29.333 --> 00:14:30.250 align:middle line:10%
Have you noticed that?

00:14:30.250 --> 00:14:32.020 align:middle line:10%
I say, god, it must
be the end the world.

00:14:32.020 --> 00:14:34.030 align:middle line:10%
All the good ones are
leaving, but then it's

00:14:34.030 --> 00:14:35.920 align:middle line:10%
the beginning of a new
world, and all the good ones

00:14:35.920 --> 00:14:36.720 align:middle line:10%
are coming back.

00:14:36.720 --> 00:14:39.010 align:middle line:10%
So it all works out OK.

00:14:39.010 --> 00:14:42.100 align:middle line:84%
But I've had the opportunity
to study with these people.

00:14:42.100 --> 00:14:43.110 align:middle line:90%
They aren't scientists.

00:14:43.110 --> 00:14:44.110 align:middle line:90%
These aren't scientists.

00:14:44.110 --> 00:14:47.245 align:middle line:10%
But they understand these
fundamental principles

00:14:47.245 --> 00:14:48.870 align:middle line:10%
that we're going to
talk about tonight.

00:14:48.870 --> 00:14:51.400 align:middle line:10%
And the beautiful women
that are anchoring

00:14:51.400 --> 00:14:53.180 align:middle line:10%
this powerful feminine energy.

00:14:53.180 --> 00:14:54.940 align:middle line:10%
This is in the southern Andes.

00:14:54.940 --> 00:14:56.440 align:middle line:10%
I've known this
woman over 20 years,

00:14:56.440 --> 00:14:58.510 align:middle line:10%
and she hasn't
aged over 20 years.

00:14:58.510 --> 00:15:01.450 align:middle line:10%
And in her mid-50's, she
just had her third child.

00:15:01.450 --> 00:15:02.750 align:middle line:10%
And they do this.

00:15:02.750 --> 00:15:03.550 align:middle line:10%
They do this.

00:15:03.550 --> 00:15:04.383 align:middle line:10%
And they're healthy.

00:15:04.383 --> 00:15:07.100 align:middle line:10%
And in these communities,
you don't have breast cancer.

00:15:07.100 --> 00:15:09.010 align:middle line:10%
You don't have prostate cancer.

00:15:09.010 --> 00:15:10.810 align:middle line:10%
So it's not about aging.

00:15:10.810 --> 00:15:12.260 align:middle line:10%
It's about our story.

00:15:12.260 --> 00:15:14.950 align:middle line:10%
It's about how we
live our lives as we

00:15:14.950 --> 00:15:17.380 align:middle line:10%
attain the chronological age.

00:15:17.380 --> 00:15:19.840 align:middle line:84%
I talk about that in
some of the books.

00:15:19.840 --> 00:15:22.360 align:middle line:84%
I'm a scientist, so
I've had the opportunity

00:15:22.360 --> 00:15:24.370 align:middle line:84%
to see the scientific
story as well.

00:15:24.370 --> 00:15:25.780 align:middle line:90%
I'm a degreed earth scientist.

00:15:25.780 --> 00:15:29.110 align:middle line:84%
I'm a geologist, a strong
background in life science,

00:15:29.110 --> 00:15:31.090 align:middle line:84%
math, computer
science, and physics.

00:15:31.090 --> 00:15:33.580 align:middle line:84%
And it all works
together to help

00:15:33.580 --> 00:15:37.030 align:middle line:84%
me stay current with the
new discoveries that are not

00:15:37.030 --> 00:15:39.125 align:middle line:90%
being shared in the mainstream.

00:15:39.125 --> 00:15:40.000 align:middle line:90%
I've got to tell you.

00:15:40.000 --> 00:15:44.140 align:middle line:90%
Science is on a tear right now.

00:15:44.140 --> 00:15:46.690 align:middle line:84%
The new discoveries--
we've asked science,

00:15:46.690 --> 00:15:48.435 align:middle line:90%
science, tell us who we are.

00:15:48.435 --> 00:15:50.560 align:middle line:84%
And science is telling us--
and a lot of scientists

00:15:50.560 --> 00:15:53.050 align:middle line:84%
don't like what the
science is telling them.

00:15:53.050 --> 00:15:55.420 align:middle line:84%
It's not being shared in
the mainstream classrooms,

00:15:55.420 --> 00:15:56.470 align:middle line:90%
mainstream textbooks.

00:15:56.470 --> 00:15:58.887 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to share some of it
with you right here tonight.

00:15:58.887 --> 00:16:02.500 align:middle line:84%
But what I want to say is the
science, rock solid science,

00:16:02.500 --> 00:16:05.590 align:middle line:84%
this peer-reviewed science,
not Gregg's hypothesis,

00:16:05.590 --> 00:16:08.250 align:middle line:84%
or Gregg's theory,
or Gregg's opinion,

00:16:08.250 --> 00:16:10.377 align:middle line:84%
but rock solid science is
telling us, number one,

00:16:10.377 --> 00:16:11.710 align:middle line:90%
we are not what we've been told.

00:16:11.710 --> 00:16:14.710 align:middle line:84%
Number two, number two,
we're more probably

00:16:14.710 --> 00:16:18.130 align:middle line:84%
than we've ever even allowed
ourselves to imagine.

00:16:18.130 --> 00:16:22.810 align:middle line:84%
You are such an awesome,
powerful, majestic,

00:16:22.810 --> 00:16:26.860 align:middle line:84%
sophisticated, internally
advanced technology.

00:16:26.860 --> 00:16:29.200 align:middle line:90%
You are a soft technology.

00:16:29.200 --> 00:16:31.750 align:middle line:84%
And that soft technology,
you're the only form of life

00:16:31.750 --> 00:16:35.260 align:middle line:84%
that can self-regulate
your soft technology.

00:16:35.260 --> 00:16:37.015 align:middle line:84%
That's why I'm here
to talk about tonight.

00:16:37.015 --> 00:16:38.800 align:middle line:84%
It's what I want to talk
to you about tonight.

00:16:38.800 --> 00:16:40.383 align:middle line:84%
I know I'm speaking
fast, because I've

00:16:40.383 --> 00:16:43.900 align:middle line:84%
got a lot to that I
want to get to before we

00:16:43.900 --> 00:16:46.100 align:middle line:90%
get to an experiential place.

00:16:46.100 --> 00:16:48.018 align:middle line:84%
Now, I want to do more
than just talk to you.

00:16:48.018 --> 00:16:49.810 align:middle line:84%
At the last minute, I
changed this program.

00:16:49.810 --> 00:16:51.518 align:middle line:84%
I want you to have
some direct experience

00:16:51.518 --> 00:16:53.350 align:middle line:90%
right here in the room with me.

00:16:53.350 --> 00:16:54.950 align:middle line:90%
Some rock solid tools.

00:16:54.950 --> 00:16:55.750 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:16:55.750 --> 00:16:58.630 align:middle line:90%
Well, here's the thing.

00:16:58.630 --> 00:17:00.190 align:middle line:84%
Typically, when
they say keynote,

00:17:00.190 --> 00:17:02.170 align:middle line:84%
a keynote is like
you're going to say

00:17:02.170 --> 00:17:05.248 align:middle line:84%
some cool stuff that opens
the door to something else.

00:17:05.248 --> 00:17:06.790 align:middle line:84%
And I'm happy to do
that, but I don't

00:17:06.790 --> 00:17:08.707 align:middle line:84%
know if I'm going to see
you all again or not.

00:17:08.707 --> 00:17:11.660 align:middle line:84%
And if I never see you again,
when I go to sleep at night,

00:17:11.660 --> 00:17:14.520 align:middle line:84%
I want to know in my heart that
you, my brothers and sisters,

00:17:14.520 --> 00:17:17.020 align:middle line:84%
you and I worked together to
learn something about ourselves

00:17:17.020 --> 00:17:18.760 align:middle line:84%
today that makes
our lives better,

00:17:18.760 --> 00:17:20.890 align:middle line:84%
and that helps us
to become better

00:17:20.890 --> 00:17:23.127 align:middle line:84%
for our families
and our communities.

00:17:23.127 --> 00:17:24.460 align:middle line:90%
And that's why I'm talking fast.

00:17:24.460 --> 00:17:29.603 align:middle line:90%


00:17:29.603 --> 00:17:30.770 align:middle line:90%
So I'm going to be personal.

00:17:30.770 --> 00:17:32.360 align:middle line:84%
You are not what
you've been told.

00:17:32.360 --> 00:17:35.390 align:middle line:84%
You're absolutely more than
you probably ever imagined.

00:17:35.390 --> 00:17:39.980 align:middle line:84%
So if you change your story,
what would you imagine changes?

00:17:39.980 --> 00:17:42.060 align:middle line:90%
Change your story, change what?

00:17:42.060 --> 00:17:42.860 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

00:17:42.860 --> 00:17:43.610 align:middle line:90%
Change your life.

00:17:43.610 --> 00:17:45.110 align:middle line:84%
Change your story,
change your life.

00:17:45.110 --> 00:17:47.520 align:middle line:84%
But what happens if we
change our collective story?

00:17:47.520 --> 00:17:49.188 align:middle line:90%
What would you imagine happens?

00:17:49.188 --> 00:17:50.480 align:middle line:90%
Oh, man, you guys are right on.

00:17:50.480 --> 00:17:53.210 align:middle line:84%
Change our story,
you change the world.

00:17:53.210 --> 00:17:55.670 align:middle line:84%
We are at a point
right now where

00:17:55.670 --> 00:17:58.730 align:middle line:84%
the lies and the things that we
believed in the past that are

00:17:58.730 --> 00:18:01.340 align:middle line:90%
not sustainable are collapsing.

00:18:01.340 --> 00:18:04.370 align:middle line:84%
The question is,
what replaces them?

00:18:04.370 --> 00:18:07.970 align:middle line:84%
What goes into the
vacuum that's being left?

00:18:07.970 --> 00:18:10.460 align:middle line:84%
And the answer to that
is what we are deciding

00:18:10.460 --> 00:18:12.352 align:middle line:90%
in this generation right now.

00:18:12.352 --> 00:18:14.060 align:middle line:84%
And I want you know,
all the discoveries,

00:18:14.060 --> 00:18:15.920 align:middle line:84%
the big discoveries,
we've already solved all

00:18:15.920 --> 00:18:17.170 align:middle line:90%
the big problems in the world.

00:18:17.170 --> 00:18:18.980 align:middle line:90%
I talk about in longer programs.

00:18:18.980 --> 00:18:23.000 align:middle line:84%
We've got all the solutions for
food and energy and medicine,

00:18:23.000 --> 00:18:24.930 align:middle line:90%
longevity, and healing.

00:18:24.930 --> 00:18:26.540 align:middle line:84%
And that's how I
know, that's how

00:18:26.540 --> 00:18:28.070 align:middle line:84%
I know that if
the powers that be

00:18:28.070 --> 00:18:30.290 align:middle line:84%
were really serious about
things like climate change,

00:18:30.290 --> 00:18:32.270 align:middle line:84%
they would bring those
technologies to bear

00:18:32.270 --> 00:18:33.800 align:middle line:90%
upon the world.

00:18:33.800 --> 00:18:34.710 align:middle line:90%
It's not happening.

00:18:34.710 --> 00:18:36.543 align:middle line:84%
And it's not happening
for a lot of reasons,

00:18:36.543 --> 00:18:37.610 align:middle line:90%
but that's changing.

00:18:37.610 --> 00:18:38.900 align:middle line:90%
It's changing in places.

00:18:38.900 --> 00:18:42.290 align:middle line:84%
I want to thank Conscious
Life Expo for the opportunity

00:18:42.290 --> 00:18:44.510 align:middle line:84%
to bring this kind
of information

00:18:44.510 --> 00:18:48.530 align:middle line:84%
to a broad general audience
in a really accessible way.

00:18:48.530 --> 00:18:50.030 align:middle line:84%
You see all kinds--
have you noticed

00:18:50.030 --> 00:18:52.580 align:middle line:84%
you see all kinds of people
at the Conscious Life Expo?

00:18:52.580 --> 00:18:54.260 align:middle line:90%
Have you noticed that?

00:18:54.260 --> 00:18:55.940 align:middle line:90%
Because this is a mecca.

00:18:55.940 --> 00:18:58.308 align:middle line:84%
It is a mecca where people
come out of curiosity.

00:18:58.308 --> 00:19:00.350 align:middle line:84%
They come and they say,
I want to check this out.

00:19:00.350 --> 00:19:01.892 align:middle line:84%
I want to see what
this is all about.

00:19:01.892 --> 00:19:03.950 align:middle line:84%
I saw this guy on TV or
I listened this woman.

00:19:03.950 --> 00:19:05.810 align:middle line:90%
I heard her on the radio.

00:19:05.810 --> 00:19:07.100 align:middle line:90%
I want to check it out.

00:19:07.100 --> 00:19:09.050 align:middle line:84%
And it's an
opportunity to converge

00:19:09.050 --> 00:19:12.950 align:middle line:84%
in one place for a few
short days and do just that.

00:19:12.950 --> 00:19:15.920 align:middle line:84%
And that's why I'm so
excited about sharing this.

00:19:15.920 --> 00:19:19.310 align:middle line:84%
What I want to talk to
you about is the battle.

00:19:19.310 --> 00:19:20.270 align:middle line:90%
There is a battle.

00:19:20.270 --> 00:19:22.145 align:middle line:84%
It's playing out right
before our very eyes.

00:19:22.145 --> 00:19:23.270 align:middle line:90%
You've often heard it said.

00:19:23.270 --> 00:19:26.390 align:middle line:84%
The best way to hide
something is what?

00:19:26.390 --> 00:19:27.690 align:middle line:90%
Keep it in plain sight.

00:19:27.690 --> 00:19:31.040 align:middle line:84%
There's a battle playing out
right in front of our eyes.

00:19:31.040 --> 00:19:33.140 align:middle line:90%
There's a battle for your story.

00:19:33.140 --> 00:19:35.090 align:middle line:84%
There's a battle for
your story, for the way

00:19:35.090 --> 00:19:37.250 align:middle line:90%
that you think about yourself.

00:19:37.250 --> 00:19:39.180 align:middle line:84%
There's a battle
for your thoughts.

00:19:39.180 --> 00:19:40.100 align:middle line:90%
Have you noticed that?

00:19:40.100 --> 00:19:41.558 align:middle line:84%
There's a battle
for your thoughts.

00:19:41.558 --> 00:19:43.280 align:middle line:84%
It's playing out in
mainstream media.

00:19:43.280 --> 00:19:45.680 align:middle line:84%
It's playing out all across
the mainstream media.

00:19:45.680 --> 00:19:48.630 align:middle line:84%
I have yet to see
anything exempt.

00:19:48.630 --> 00:19:50.840 align:middle line:84%
It's playing out
in the classrooms.

00:19:50.840 --> 00:19:54.230 align:middle line:84%
There are actually books that
are being banned in the United

00:19:54.230 --> 00:19:56.450 align:middle line:84%
States classrooms
right now because they

00:19:56.450 --> 00:20:01.220 align:middle line:84%
tell a story that does not
fit the mainstream narrative.

00:20:01.220 --> 00:20:03.980 align:middle line:84%
But it is a powerful story
of hope and possibility.

00:20:03.980 --> 00:20:06.380 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to share part of
the story with you right now.

00:20:06.380 --> 00:20:07.588 align:middle line:90%
But it goes even beyond that.

00:20:07.588 --> 00:20:10.340 align:middle line:84%
There's a battle for where
you think you came from, what

00:20:10.340 --> 00:20:12.860 align:middle line:90%
you think your origins are.

00:20:12.860 --> 00:20:16.415 align:middle line:10%
The new DNA science is
overturning 150 years of what

00:20:16.415 --> 00:20:17.540 align:middle line:10%
you and I have been taught.

00:20:17.540 --> 00:20:20.000 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to get to
that very, very quickly

00:20:20.000 --> 00:20:22.772 align:middle line:84%
tonight right here,
because it's not the story.

00:20:22.772 --> 00:20:24.730 align:middle line:84%
I grew up-- I went to
school in the late 1950s,

00:20:24.730 --> 00:20:26.990 align:middle line:90%
'60s, early '70s.

00:20:26.990 --> 00:20:28.470 align:middle line:84%
As a scientist, I
have to tell you,

00:20:28.470 --> 00:20:30.095 align:middle line:84%
as a scientist, what
I'm going to share

00:20:30.095 --> 00:20:32.120 align:middle line:84%
with you goes 180
degrees against what

00:20:32.120 --> 00:20:33.710 align:middle line:90%
I was taught as a scientist.

00:20:33.710 --> 00:20:37.040 align:middle line:84%
However, it's what
the evidence supports.

00:20:37.040 --> 00:20:39.783 align:middle line:10%
The evidence no longer
supports the old story.

00:20:39.783 --> 00:20:41.450 align:middle line:84%
There is a battle for
the way you think,

00:20:41.450 --> 00:20:44.410 align:middle line:84%
not only how you began,
but how the universe began.

00:20:44.410 --> 00:20:46.160 align:middle line:84%
There is a battle for
what you're thinking

00:20:46.160 --> 00:20:48.470 align:middle line:90%
about climate change right now.

00:20:48.470 --> 00:20:51.060 align:middle line:84%
You're being told all kinds of
stories about climate change.

00:20:51.060 --> 00:20:54.090 align:middle line:84%
There's a battle of what you're
thinking about chem trails.

00:20:54.090 --> 00:20:56.967 align:middle line:84%
There's a battle for 5G and
what you think about 5G.

00:20:56.967 --> 00:20:58.550 align:middle line:84%
Is it a good or bad
or right or wrong?

00:20:58.550 --> 00:21:00.572 align:middle line:84%
There's a battle
playing out for that.

00:21:00.572 --> 00:21:02.780 align:middle line:84%
There's a battle for what's
playing out in the skies.

00:21:02.780 --> 00:21:05.322 align:middle line:84%
And you're being taught how to
think about what's playing out

00:21:05.322 --> 00:21:08.630 align:middle line:84%
in the skies over your
home and over our cities,

00:21:08.630 --> 00:21:11.443 align:middle line:84%
and who's behind what's
playing out in the skies.

00:21:11.443 --> 00:21:12.860 align:middle line:84%
And how long we've
known about it.

00:21:12.860 --> 00:21:17.160 align:middle line:84%
These are 5,000-year-old rock
records telling us we are part

00:21:17.160 --> 00:21:17.960 align:middle line:90%
of a global--

00:21:17.960 --> 00:21:20.113 align:middle line:84%
or a cosmic community
that has been

00:21:20.113 --> 00:21:21.530 align:middle line:84%
around much, much
longer than what

00:21:21.530 --> 00:21:23.570 align:middle line:90%
we're being led to believe.

00:21:23.570 --> 00:21:24.862 align:middle line:90%
There's a battle for your body.

00:21:24.862 --> 00:21:26.695 align:middle line:84%
Did you know there's a
battle for your body?

00:21:26.695 --> 00:21:27.740 align:middle line:90%
Have you seen that?

00:21:27.740 --> 00:21:29.740 align:middle line:84%
There's a battle telling
you what you need

00:21:29.740 --> 00:21:30.740 align:middle line:90%
and what you don't need.

00:21:30.740 --> 00:21:32.540 align:middle line:84%
There's a battle
telling you what

00:21:32.540 --> 00:21:35.397 align:middle line:84%
to put into your children's
body before they even

00:21:35.397 --> 00:21:36.980 align:middle line:84%
leave the hospital,
the moment they're

00:21:36.980 --> 00:21:40.800 align:middle line:84%
born, the moment they're born,
and up until the first six

00:21:40.800 --> 00:21:41.600 align:middle line:90%
months.

00:21:41.600 --> 00:21:42.683 align:middle line:90%
There's a battle for that.

00:21:42.683 --> 00:21:45.170 align:middle line:84%
There's a battle about
what it is that you need

00:21:45.170 --> 00:21:47.000 align:middle line:90%
to ease the pain in your life.

00:21:47.000 --> 00:21:48.770 align:middle line:84%
And it's causing
a lot of problems.

00:21:48.770 --> 00:21:49.980 align:middle line:90%
What you need to be healthy.

00:21:49.980 --> 00:21:53.120 align:middle line:84%
These are all parts of the
battle that are playing out.

00:21:53.120 --> 00:21:55.040 align:middle line:90%
But there's a bigger battle.

00:21:55.040 --> 00:21:56.150 align:middle line:90%
There's a bigger battle.

00:21:56.150 --> 00:22:00.140 align:middle line:84%
So don't get caught
in the diversions

00:22:00.140 --> 00:22:02.270 align:middle line:90%
of those other battles.

00:22:02.270 --> 00:22:03.260 align:middle line:90%
This is the big battle.

00:22:03.260 --> 00:22:07.420 align:middle line:84%
It is a battle for
your very humanness.

00:22:07.420 --> 00:22:09.420 align:middle line:84%
What I want to say
to you is you and I

00:22:09.420 --> 00:22:14.040 align:middle line:84%
are such a rare and
precious form of life.

00:22:14.040 --> 00:22:18.210 align:middle line:84%
And there's something
so unique about us

00:22:18.210 --> 00:22:21.660 align:middle line:84%
that has been honored through
the ages from this world

00:22:21.660 --> 00:22:22.750 align:middle line:90%
and from other worlds.

00:22:22.750 --> 00:22:26.700 align:middle line:84%
And it's being threatened
right now by technology.

00:22:26.700 --> 00:22:27.630 align:middle line:90%
That is the battle.

00:22:27.630 --> 00:22:30.975 align:middle line:84%
Technology is changing
the human story.

00:22:30.975 --> 00:22:33.350 align:middle line:84%
And I'm not going to say it's
right, wrong, good, or bad.

00:22:33.350 --> 00:22:36.750 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to say we
need to be aware of what

00:22:36.750 --> 00:22:39.520 align:middle line:84%
it is that's happening so
that we can make wise choices.

00:22:39.520 --> 00:22:41.660 align:middle line:84%
Does that make sense
if I say it that way?

00:22:41.660 --> 00:22:42.460 align:middle line:90%
All right.

00:22:42.460 --> 00:22:43.835 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to give
you an example.

00:22:43.835 --> 00:22:47.400 align:middle line:10%
We now have the technology
within just the last four

00:22:47.400 --> 00:22:49.140 align:middle line:10%
years.

00:22:49.140 --> 00:22:53.850 align:middle line:84%
We have the technology that we
can customize a human embryo

00:22:53.850 --> 00:22:55.920 align:middle line:90%
while it's still in the womb.

00:22:55.920 --> 00:22:58.750 align:middle line:84%
Now, this is a
dangerous thing to do,

00:22:58.750 --> 00:23:04.530 align:middle line:84%
because natural evolutionary
processes eliminate

00:23:04.530 --> 00:23:06.210 align:middle line:84%
the things that
don't work for us,

00:23:06.210 --> 00:23:08.370 align:middle line:84%
and they enhance the
things that do in the DNA.

00:23:08.370 --> 00:23:12.870 align:middle line:84%
And when you start designer
DNA, designer babies,

00:23:12.870 --> 00:23:14.430 align:middle line:84%
when you start
customizing those,

00:23:14.430 --> 00:23:17.580 align:middle line:84%
you are preventing those
unwanted characteristics

00:23:17.580 --> 00:23:18.490 align:middle line:90%
from existing.

00:23:18.490 --> 00:23:20.070 align:middle line:90%
Let me just give an example.

00:23:20.070 --> 00:23:22.080 align:middle line:84%
I think most people in
this room know what this.

00:23:22.080 --> 00:23:23.130 align:middle line:90%
It's a word processor.

00:23:23.130 --> 00:23:24.900 align:middle line:90%
You've all seen word processors?

00:23:24.900 --> 00:23:28.110 align:middle line:84%
I was just with an audience
in another country.

00:23:28.110 --> 00:23:30.592 align:middle line:84%
And they don't have as
many computers as we do.

00:23:30.592 --> 00:23:32.550 align:middle line:84%
And they didn't know what
a word processor was.

00:23:32.550 --> 00:23:35.040 align:middle line:84%
And that's why I put
this up to show them.

00:23:35.040 --> 00:23:37.440 align:middle line:84%
So what happens in
word processors?

00:23:37.440 --> 00:23:39.330 align:middle line:84%
You can take a
word, or a phrase,

00:23:39.330 --> 00:23:41.190 align:middle line:84%
or an entire sentence
or paragraph,

00:23:41.190 --> 00:23:43.925 align:middle line:84%
and you can cut it from
one place in the document

00:23:43.925 --> 00:23:45.300 align:middle line:84%
and paste it into
somewhere else.

00:23:45.300 --> 00:23:46.550 align:middle line:90%
You all have done that, right?

00:23:46.550 --> 00:23:48.420 align:middle line:84%
You know where
we're going, right?

00:23:48.420 --> 00:23:50.350 align:middle line:84%
That concept-- are you
good with that concept?

00:23:50.350 --> 00:23:51.150 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:23:51.150 --> 00:23:55.110 align:middle line:84%
That concept is exactly what's
happening now with the DNA.

00:23:55.110 --> 00:23:59.220 align:middle line:84%
This is an actual screen
from a DNA editor.

00:23:59.220 --> 00:24:01.140 align:middle line:84%
Instead of a word
processor, you're

00:24:01.140 --> 00:24:03.190 align:middle line:90%
looking at a strand of DNA.

00:24:03.190 --> 00:24:08.040 align:middle line:84%
You can actually take
that DNA, and you

00:24:08.040 --> 00:24:11.890 align:middle line:90%
can select very specific genes.

00:24:11.890 --> 00:24:16.170 align:middle line:84%
And you can cut and paste those
or eliminate them altogether,

00:24:16.170 --> 00:24:18.630 align:middle line:84%
just like you would
a word processor.

00:24:18.630 --> 00:24:21.300 align:middle line:84%
And you can do it while
the living embryo is still

00:24:21.300 --> 00:24:22.910 align:middle line:90%
in the womb of the mother.

00:24:22.910 --> 00:24:23.710 align:middle line:90%
You can do that.

00:24:23.710 --> 00:24:27.222 align:middle line:84%
I have a beautiful, very rare
clip I want to share with you.

00:24:27.222 --> 00:24:28.680 align:middle line:84%
Are you OK with
talking about this?

00:24:28.680 --> 00:24:29.850 align:middle line:90%
Are you good with this?

00:24:29.850 --> 00:24:35.310 align:middle line:84%
So this is the first
documented piece of a film

00:24:35.310 --> 00:24:37.020 align:middle line:84%
where this has
actually happened.

00:24:37.020 --> 00:24:38.450 align:middle line:90%
It's a technology called CRISPR.

00:24:38.450 --> 00:24:39.950 align:middle line:84%
I know some of you
are very familiar

00:24:39.950 --> 00:24:42.248 align:middle line:84%
with CRISPR technology,
CRISPR gene editing.

00:24:42.248 --> 00:24:43.290 align:middle line:90%
So here it is right here.

00:24:43.290 --> 00:24:45.790 align:middle line:84%
This is the first
real-time CRISPR image.

00:24:45.790 --> 00:24:46.830 align:middle line:90%
Play it a couple times.

00:24:46.830 --> 00:24:49.450 align:middle line:90%
This is the DNA right here.

00:24:49.450 --> 00:24:50.250 align:middle line:90%
I want you to look.

00:24:50.250 --> 00:24:53.970 align:middle line:84%
When the little white
circle comes up,

00:24:53.970 --> 00:24:55.530 align:middle line:84%
look at what's
inside the circle.

00:24:55.530 --> 00:24:57.930 align:middle line:84%
And then you'll
see it disappear.

00:24:57.930 --> 00:24:58.730 align:middle line:90%
Where is it?

00:24:58.730 --> 00:25:01.130 align:middle line:90%


00:25:01.130 --> 00:25:01.930 align:middle line:90%
Where did it go?

00:25:01.930 --> 00:25:03.040 align:middle line:90%
There it is right there.

00:25:03.040 --> 00:25:03.250 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:25:03.250 --> 00:25:04.208 align:middle line:90%
Now watch what happens.

00:25:04.208 --> 00:25:07.250 align:middle line:90%


00:25:07.250 --> 00:25:08.580 align:middle line:90%
Beginning, OK, it's there.

00:25:08.580 --> 00:25:09.380 align:middle line:90%
It's there.

00:25:09.380 --> 00:25:10.070 align:middle line:90%
It's there.

00:25:10.070 --> 00:25:10.820 align:middle line:90%
It's there.

00:25:10.820 --> 00:25:11.420 align:middle line:90%
It's there.

00:25:11.420 --> 00:25:12.330 align:middle line:90%
See it right there?

00:25:12.330 --> 00:25:13.280 align:middle line:90%
It's there.

00:25:13.280 --> 00:25:15.920 align:middle line:90%
And now, there it is, it's gone.

00:25:15.920 --> 00:25:18.620 align:middle line:84%
They just took a piece of
genetic information out

00:25:18.620 --> 00:25:22.938 align:middle line:84%
of a living strand of DNA
inside of a living embryo

00:25:22.938 --> 00:25:24.230 align:middle line:90%
is what's happening right here.

00:25:24.230 --> 00:25:28.410 align:middle line:84%
Now, in theory, that could
be pretty cool, in theory.

00:25:28.410 --> 00:25:33.770 align:middle line:84%
But what happened was the
theory got out of the bag.

00:25:33.770 --> 00:25:35.390 align:middle line:84%
And it surprised
a lot of people.

00:25:35.390 --> 00:25:38.810 align:middle line:10%
This man right here
November of 2018

00:25:38.810 --> 00:25:41.030 align:middle line:10%
announced in the
scientific journals

00:25:41.030 --> 00:25:44.330 align:middle line:10%
that he had done something that
was only thought theoretically

00:25:44.330 --> 00:25:47.420 align:middle line:10%
possible, that he
had actually edited

00:25:47.420 --> 00:25:51.240 align:middle line:10%
the DNA of an unborn child,
and the child now has been born

00:25:51.240 --> 00:25:55.663 align:middle line:10%
and is the first living
birth of DNA-edited children.

00:25:55.663 --> 00:25:56.580 align:middle line:10%
Here it is right here.

00:25:56.580 --> 00:25:58.072 align:middle line:10%
There's the first
baby right there.

00:25:58.072 --> 00:25:59.030 align:middle line:10%
And I'll tell you what.

00:25:59.030 --> 00:26:01.040 align:middle line:10%
The scientific community
came down on him

00:26:01.040 --> 00:26:02.330 align:middle line:10%
like a ton of bricks.

00:26:02.330 --> 00:26:04.130 align:middle line:10%
And they said, wait a minute.

00:26:04.130 --> 00:26:08.060 align:middle line:10%
Just because we can doesn't
mean that we should.

00:26:08.060 --> 00:26:10.040 align:middle line:10%
And he said, well,
wait a minute.

00:26:10.040 --> 00:26:11.990 align:middle line:10%
We would never
learn how to do this

00:26:11.990 --> 00:26:14.030 align:middle line:10%
unless we were meant to do it.

00:26:14.030 --> 00:26:15.923 align:middle line:10%
This is the crux of
a scientific argument

00:26:15.923 --> 00:26:18.090 align:middle line:10%
that I've heard throughout
my career as a scientist.

00:26:18.090 --> 00:26:20.000 align:middle line:10%
There's some scientists
that say if we were never

00:26:20.000 --> 00:26:21.667 align:middle line:10%
meant to do these
things, we would never

00:26:21.667 --> 00:26:23.570 align:middle line:10%
learn how to do them.

00:26:23.570 --> 00:26:26.180 align:middle line:10%
Other scientists say,
just because we can

00:26:26.180 --> 00:26:28.010 align:middle line:10%
doesn't mean that we should.

00:26:28.010 --> 00:26:29.690 align:middle line:10%
But this is now
possible right now.

00:26:29.690 --> 00:26:34.790 align:middle line:10%
So we are now on a path
of literally customizing

00:26:34.790 --> 00:26:38.032 align:middle line:10%
the DNA inside of living--
and now more have happen.

00:26:38.032 --> 00:26:38.990 align:middle line:10%
It's not just this one.

00:26:38.990 --> 00:26:40.550 align:middle line:10%
It is now happening.

00:26:40.550 --> 00:26:41.430 align:middle line:10%
But you're not hear--

00:26:41.430 --> 00:26:43.030 align:middle line:10%
how many have heard
about this on mainstream?

00:26:43.030 --> 00:26:44.655 align:middle line:10%
Anybody hear about
in mainstream media?

00:26:44.655 --> 00:26:46.940 align:middle line:10%
Well, this is a very
informed audience.

00:26:46.940 --> 00:26:48.170 align:middle line:90%
Very informed.

00:26:48.170 --> 00:26:51.260 align:middle line:84%
We're engineering the way that
we connect with one another.

00:26:51.260 --> 00:26:53.060 align:middle line:84%
This photograph
could have been taken

00:26:53.060 --> 00:26:56.270 align:middle line:84%
on any main street of any
city anywhere in the world.

00:26:56.270 --> 00:26:58.010 align:middle line:90%
How many of you have seen this?

00:26:58.010 --> 00:27:02.510 align:middle line:84%
People walking together, and
everyone's in their own world.

00:27:02.510 --> 00:27:05.300 align:middle line:84%
What the studies have shown
is that we have the technology

00:27:05.300 --> 00:27:09.080 align:middle line:84%
to be more connected than we
have ever been in the past,

00:27:09.080 --> 00:27:12.710 align:middle line:84%
and we are more lonely
than we've ever been.

00:27:12.710 --> 00:27:14.450 align:middle line:90%
Think about that.

00:27:14.450 --> 00:27:16.490 align:middle line:84%
The technology
connects us, but we're

00:27:16.490 --> 00:27:19.658 align:middle line:84%
more alone than we've
ever been in our lives.

00:27:19.658 --> 00:27:21.950 align:middle line:84%
And this is a lot of what's
happening-- the way that we

00:27:21.950 --> 00:27:22.750 align:middle line:90%
learn to connect.

00:27:22.750 --> 00:27:24.500 align:middle line:84%
Now, how many of
you have seen this?

00:27:24.500 --> 00:27:25.640 align:middle line:90%
You laugh when you see it.

00:27:25.640 --> 00:27:26.710 align:middle line:90%
But a couple goes out.

00:27:26.710 --> 00:27:27.530 align:middle line:90%
They're busy.

00:27:27.530 --> 00:27:28.610 align:middle line:90%
They've got two careers.

00:27:28.610 --> 00:27:29.300 align:middle line:90%
They've got kids.

00:27:29.300 --> 00:27:30.110 align:middle line:90%
They get away.

00:27:30.110 --> 00:27:31.203 align:middle line:90%
Mom keeps the kids.

00:27:31.203 --> 00:27:33.620 align:middle line:84%
And they go out and have a
beautiful nice romantic dinner.

00:27:33.620 --> 00:27:36.887 align:middle line:84%
Before dinner is even
over, what are they doing?

00:27:36.887 --> 00:27:37.970 align:middle line:90%
They're checking messages.

00:27:37.970 --> 00:27:39.387 align:middle line:84%
Now, if both of
them are doing it,

00:27:39.387 --> 00:27:41.090 align:middle line:84%
maybe it's not so
much of a problem.

00:27:41.090 --> 00:27:43.040 align:middle line:84%
But more often than
not, you see that.

00:27:43.040 --> 00:27:45.470 align:middle line:90%
Do you see what's happening?

00:27:45.470 --> 00:27:46.730 align:middle line:90%
He's checking his messages.

00:27:46.730 --> 00:27:48.743 align:middle line:90%
She's not too happy about it.

00:27:48.743 --> 00:27:50.410 align:middle line:84%
And I see this happening
in restaurants.

00:27:50.410 --> 00:27:53.240 align:middle line:84%
And now it's not just in
English-speaking restaurants

00:27:53.240 --> 00:27:54.040 align:middle line:90%
or just in America.

00:27:54.040 --> 00:27:55.207 align:middle line:90%
I see it all over the world.

00:27:55.207 --> 00:27:56.570 align:middle line:90%
I see this happening.

00:27:56.570 --> 00:28:00.050 align:middle line:84%
Kids, kids, how many
of you have kids

00:28:00.050 --> 00:28:03.140 align:middle line:84%
that are dealing with
social technology right now

00:28:03.140 --> 00:28:06.560 align:middle line:84%
and learning about what
that means in their lives?

00:28:06.560 --> 00:28:10.340 align:middle line:84%
It's changed the way young
people actually communicate.

00:28:10.340 --> 00:28:15.140 align:middle line:84%
We're blurring the connection
between human and non-human.

00:28:15.140 --> 00:28:16.580 align:middle line:90%
Robots used to look like that.

00:28:16.580 --> 00:28:19.970 align:middle line:84%
It used to be pretty easy to
see what a robot looked like.

00:28:19.970 --> 00:28:20.870 align:middle line:90%
Guess what.

00:28:20.870 --> 00:28:22.790 align:middle line:90%
That's a robot.

00:28:22.790 --> 00:28:24.212 align:middle line:90%
That's a robot.

00:28:24.212 --> 00:28:25.670 align:middle line:84%
And if they look
that good, they're

00:28:25.670 --> 00:28:27.615 align:middle line:84%
going to do more than
housecleaning, right?

00:28:27.615 --> 00:28:28.540 align:middle line:90%
Do you agree?

00:28:28.540 --> 00:28:31.140 align:middle line:90%


00:28:31.140 --> 00:28:32.600 align:middle line:90%
They are.

00:28:32.600 --> 00:28:35.930 align:middle line:90%
It's a whole new industry.

00:28:35.930 --> 00:28:39.140 align:middle line:90%
It's a whole new industry.

00:28:39.140 --> 00:28:41.570 align:middle line:84%
There's a whole new industry
that's emerging from this.

00:28:41.570 --> 00:28:45.680 align:middle line:84%
But I want to show you how
it threatens our humanness.

00:28:45.680 --> 00:28:48.350 align:middle line:84%
Because there's a whole
new industry emerging

00:28:48.350 --> 00:28:53.300 align:middle line:84%
from this where these
devices are replacing genuine

00:28:53.300 --> 00:28:56.420 align:middle line:90%
intimate human contact.

00:28:56.420 --> 00:28:59.390 align:middle line:84%
And there are societies
where people are opting

00:28:59.390 --> 00:29:01.290 align:middle line:90%
for this because it's easier.

00:29:01.290 --> 00:29:02.090 align:middle line:90%
It's cleaner.

00:29:02.090 --> 00:29:04.880 align:middle line:84%
You don't get caught up in
the emotional stickiness

00:29:04.880 --> 00:29:08.300 align:middle line:84%
and the mess of
tough relationships.

00:29:08.300 --> 00:29:10.220 align:middle line:84%
There are societies
now where it is

00:29:10.220 --> 00:29:15.140 align:middle line:90%
legal to marry your AI partner.

00:29:15.140 --> 00:29:16.790 align:middle line:84%
Now, can you just
take a wild guess.

00:29:16.790 --> 00:29:21.560 align:middle line:84%
Which one is the AI and
which one just got married?

00:29:21.560 --> 00:29:23.060 align:middle line:84%
Look at the look
on that guy's face.

00:29:23.060 --> 00:29:24.680 align:middle line:90%
I love this.

00:29:24.680 --> 00:29:29.300 align:middle line:84%
He has just married his
AI, his dream AI partner.

00:29:29.300 --> 00:29:31.910 align:middle line:84%
But here's where now it
goes one step-- you're not

00:29:31.910 --> 00:29:34.400 align:middle line:90%
being told this on mainstream.

00:29:34.400 --> 00:29:35.720 align:middle line:90%
So look at this.

00:29:35.720 --> 00:29:40.140 align:middle line:84%
Not only are people-- and
this isn't like a one-off.

00:29:40.140 --> 00:29:44.300 align:middle line:84%
I mean, this is an emerging
trend in some societies.

00:29:44.300 --> 00:29:50.150 align:middle line:84%
And as a result of this,
they are choosing AI babies.

00:29:50.150 --> 00:29:52.730 align:middle line:84%
They're choosing artificial
intelligent children,

00:29:52.730 --> 00:29:55.370 align:middle line:84%
because they're
easier to care for.

00:29:55.370 --> 00:29:57.230 align:middle line:84%
They don't have the
emotional problems.

00:29:57.230 --> 00:29:59.990 align:middle line:84%
Now, let me tell you
why this is a danger.

00:29:59.990 --> 00:30:01.610 align:middle line:84%
How many have never
heard about this?

00:30:01.610 --> 00:30:01.730 align:middle line:90%
See?

00:30:01.730 --> 00:30:03.170 align:middle line:84%
That's why I'm
telling you about it.

00:30:03.170 --> 00:30:03.860 align:middle line:90%
It's why I'm telling you this.

00:30:03.860 --> 00:30:06.200 align:middle line:84%
We're not being-- we've got
all these other diversions

00:30:06.200 --> 00:30:07.040 align:middle line:90%
going on.

00:30:07.040 --> 00:30:09.290 align:middle line:90%
Here's why this is a problem.

00:30:09.290 --> 00:30:14.930 align:middle line:84%
It's because when we stop
using the unique capabilities

00:30:14.930 --> 00:30:18.240 align:middle line:84%
of humanness, they
begin to atrophy--

00:30:18.240 --> 00:30:19.040 align:middle line:90%
those abilities.

00:30:19.040 --> 00:30:23.630 align:middle line:84%
And the countries where those
relationships and the AI babies

00:30:23.630 --> 00:30:26.840 align:middle line:84%
are being opted for, their
birth rate is declining.

00:30:26.840 --> 00:30:29.990 align:middle line:84%
And it's a mystery why
the women are sterile,

00:30:29.990 --> 00:30:33.020 align:middle line:84%
why the men are sterile,
and the birth rate now

00:30:33.020 --> 00:30:35.310 align:middle line:84%
has dropped below
the mortality rate.

00:30:35.310 --> 00:30:37.760 align:middle line:84%
So they're losing people
faster than they can

00:30:37.760 --> 00:30:40.100 align:middle line:90%
populate their own countries.

00:30:40.100 --> 00:30:43.400 align:middle line:84%
And this is all the result of
where technology is leading,

00:30:43.400 --> 00:30:45.200 align:middle line:84%
but we're not hearing
much about this.

00:30:45.200 --> 00:30:48.920 align:middle line:84%
Our natural abilities,
you are such

00:30:48.920 --> 00:30:50.420 align:middle line:90%
a powerfully sensitive being.

00:30:50.420 --> 00:30:55.400 align:middle line:84%
You've got this
internal soft technology

00:30:55.400 --> 00:30:58.550 align:middle line:84%
that gives you the
ability to sense realms

00:30:58.550 --> 00:31:01.520 align:middle line:84%
that no machine can
sense, right now any way,

00:31:01.520 --> 00:31:07.280 align:middle line:84%
to sense subtle realms of
energy, subtle realms of life,

00:31:07.280 --> 00:31:09.150 align:middle line:90%
to create life.

00:31:09.150 --> 00:31:11.340 align:middle line:84%
And we begin to give
away those technologies.

00:31:11.340 --> 00:31:12.140 align:middle line:90%
They atrophy.

00:31:12.140 --> 00:31:14.430 align:middle line:84%
And you say, well, maybe
one generation, no big deal.

00:31:14.430 --> 00:31:15.230 align:middle line:90%
It's a choice.

00:31:15.230 --> 00:31:16.880 align:middle line:90%
You either take it or leave it.

00:31:16.880 --> 00:31:17.990 align:middle line:84%
Look at what happened
to cell phones.

00:31:17.990 --> 00:31:20.450 align:middle line:84%
One generation, you could
either have a cell phone or not.

00:31:20.450 --> 00:31:22.550 align:middle line:84%
Next generation,
what's happening?

00:31:22.550 --> 00:31:24.170 align:middle line:90%
Everybody's got one.

00:31:24.170 --> 00:31:25.440 align:middle line:90%
When it becomes a way of life.

00:31:25.440 --> 00:31:28.970 align:middle line:10%
So here is where this gets
really, really dangerous.

00:31:28.970 --> 00:31:30.890 align:middle line:10%
You all know who this man is--

00:31:30.890 --> 00:31:31.710 align:middle line:10%
Elon Musk.

00:31:31.710 --> 00:31:33.990 align:middle line:10%
And I have a lot of
respect for Elon Musk.

00:31:33.990 --> 00:31:34.790 align:middle line:10%
He's brilliant.

00:31:34.790 --> 00:31:35.870 align:middle line:10%
He's young.

00:31:35.870 --> 00:31:39.860 align:middle line:10%
He has a Vision he has the
money to explore his vision.

00:31:39.860 --> 00:31:42.110 align:middle line:10%
And he's pushing the boundaries.

00:31:42.110 --> 00:31:43.640 align:middle line:10%
He's going to push
those boundaries

00:31:43.640 --> 00:31:45.680 align:middle line:10%
until something pushes back.

00:31:45.680 --> 00:31:49.000 align:middle line:10%
And he just announced
last year, '19,

00:31:49.000 --> 00:31:51.350 align:middle line:10%
the development company
is called Neuralink.

00:31:51.350 --> 00:31:52.907 align:middle line:84%
He is developing--
he's actually--

00:31:52.907 --> 00:31:53.990 align:middle line:90%
they're already developed.

00:31:53.990 --> 00:31:56.300 align:middle line:90%
They're now being manufactured.

00:31:56.300 --> 00:31:59.210 align:middle line:84%
The first chips, there's
the chip right there.

00:31:59.210 --> 00:32:01.640 align:middle line:84%
The computer chip
that is designed-- now

00:32:01.640 --> 00:32:02.630 align:middle line:90%
think about this.

00:32:02.630 --> 00:32:04.130 align:middle line:90%
This is a silicon chip.

00:32:04.130 --> 00:32:06.290 align:middle line:84%
And you see those
little ports on there?

00:32:06.290 --> 00:32:10.370 align:middle line:84%
Those little ports interface
with the little dendrites,

00:32:10.370 --> 00:32:14.060 align:middle line:84%
the tentacles if you will,
of the human neurons.

00:32:14.060 --> 00:32:18.680 align:middle line:84%
It is the first direct
neuron chip interface.

00:32:18.680 --> 00:32:21.570 align:middle line:84%
It's implanted into
the human brain.

00:32:21.570 --> 00:32:25.880 align:middle line:84%
And the idea is
that with this chip

00:32:25.880 --> 00:32:29.060 align:middle line:84%
we now have direct
access to your hard drive

00:32:29.060 --> 00:32:31.640 align:middle line:90%
without any cables.

00:32:31.640 --> 00:32:33.815 align:middle line:84%
Direct access to your
computer's hard drive.

00:32:33.815 --> 00:32:35.690 align:middle line:84%
Now, I was just in a
roomful of young people.

00:32:35.690 --> 00:32:39.020 align:middle line:84%
And I want to tell you
what they said, sweet.

00:32:39.020 --> 00:32:40.610 align:middle line:90%
Sweet.

00:32:40.610 --> 00:32:44.645 align:middle line:84%
It's like, man, I can game
all day long with my brain.

00:32:44.645 --> 00:32:47.470 align:middle line:90%


00:32:47.470 --> 00:32:51.550 align:middle line:84%
Remember why the technology
can be a slippery slope.

00:32:51.550 --> 00:32:55.690 align:middle line:84%
Because when we give our
power away to technology,

00:32:55.690 --> 00:32:58.030 align:middle line:90%
we begin to atrophy.

00:32:58.030 --> 00:33:01.430 align:middle line:84%
The very capacities that set
us apart from all other life.

00:33:01.430 --> 00:33:06.650 align:middle line:84%
There are neurons in the
neocortex of your brain

00:33:06.650 --> 00:33:09.290 align:middle line:84%
that already do
with that chip does

00:33:09.290 --> 00:33:11.870 align:middle line:90%
if you know how to access that.

00:33:11.870 --> 00:33:13.427 align:middle line:90%
They're called mirror neurons.

00:33:13.427 --> 00:33:15.260 align:middle line:84%
And if you've been with
me in long programs,

00:33:15.260 --> 00:33:16.840 align:middle line:84%
or Joe Dispenza
in long programs,

00:33:16.840 --> 00:33:19.280 align:middle line:84%
or Bruce Lipton in
longer programs,

00:33:19.280 --> 00:33:21.320 align:middle line:84%
we talk all about
those mirror neurons.

00:33:21.320 --> 00:33:23.090 align:middle line:84%
I want to tell you,
a mirror neuron

00:33:23.090 --> 00:33:25.730 align:middle line:84%
doesn't know the difference
between experiencing

00:33:25.730 --> 00:33:28.100 align:middle line:84%
and witnessing what it
is that's happening.

00:33:28.100 --> 00:33:30.920 align:middle line:84%
It will fire as if you
are having an experience,

00:33:30.920 --> 00:33:34.040 align:middle line:84%
even when you're watching
someone or something else.

00:33:34.040 --> 00:33:35.090 align:middle line:90%
Musicians know this.

00:33:35.090 --> 00:33:36.050 align:middle line:90%
It helps you to learn.

00:33:36.050 --> 00:33:37.820 align:middle line:84%
I'm a musician when
I'm not doing this.

00:33:37.820 --> 00:33:41.120 align:middle line:84%
It's my plan B. If this whole
author gig doesn't work out,

00:33:41.120 --> 00:33:45.450 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to go back on
the road as a musician.

00:33:45.450 --> 00:33:48.620 align:middle line:84%
But it helps us to learn
very, very quickly.

00:33:48.620 --> 00:33:52.730 align:middle line:84%
If you begin with those implants
and you're no longer accessing

00:33:52.730 --> 00:33:55.330 align:middle line:84%
those parts of your brain, in
one generation, it's a choice.

00:33:55.330 --> 00:33:57.038 align:middle line:84%
The next generation
you begin to lose it.

00:33:57.038 --> 00:34:01.970 align:middle line:84%
Pretty soon, humankind has
lost the precious abilities

00:34:01.970 --> 00:34:03.732 align:middle line:90%
that give us our uniqueness.

00:34:03.732 --> 00:34:04.940 align:middle line:90%
Now, I want to say something.

00:34:04.940 --> 00:34:07.190 align:middle line:84%
And I can say it in
this room, because you

00:34:07.190 --> 00:34:09.409 align:middle line:90%
are a very aware audience.

00:34:09.409 --> 00:34:13.802 align:middle line:84%
I cannot say what I'm about to
say to you in other audiences.

00:34:13.802 --> 00:34:15.469 align:middle line:84%
So what I'm going to
say to you is this.

00:34:15.469 --> 00:34:17.960 align:middle line:90%
I have a lot of friends.

00:34:17.960 --> 00:34:20.780 align:middle line:84%
I have a group of
friends who focus

00:34:20.780 --> 00:34:23.510 align:middle line:84%
on the abduction phenomenon,
UFO abduction phenomenon.

00:34:23.510 --> 00:34:24.870 align:middle line:90%
It is a global phenomenon.

00:34:24.870 --> 00:34:26.219 align:middle line:90%
It's been happening for decades.

00:34:26.219 --> 00:34:29.420 align:middle line:84%
I know you've heard
speakers talk about this.

00:34:29.420 --> 00:34:32.719 align:middle line:84%
One of my friends
did a study and said,

00:34:32.719 --> 00:34:34.850 align:middle line:84%
what is the common
theme that runs

00:34:34.850 --> 00:34:37.010 align:middle line:90%
through all of the abductees?

00:34:37.010 --> 00:34:40.190 align:middle line:84%
Why are these people
having these experiences?

00:34:40.190 --> 00:34:43.719 align:middle line:84%
And there are all
kinds of unique things

00:34:43.719 --> 00:34:46.719 align:middle line:84%
that are happening, but the
dominant theme, the one theme

00:34:46.719 --> 00:34:49.449 align:middle line:84%
that flowed through
everything ties directly

00:34:49.449 --> 00:34:51.439 align:middle line:84%
into what you and I are
doing here right now.

00:34:51.439 --> 00:34:52.239 align:middle line:90%
Do we have time?

00:34:52.239 --> 00:34:55.150 align:middle line:84%
Do you want to talk
about what that theme is?

00:34:55.150 --> 00:34:57.040 align:middle line:90%
The theme is this.

00:34:57.040 --> 00:35:01.270 align:middle line:84%
It's that the beings
doing the abducting

00:35:01.270 --> 00:35:06.700 align:middle line:84%
say that they come from a
lineage of life that gave

00:35:06.700 --> 00:35:09.370 align:middle line:90%
their power away to technology.

00:35:09.370 --> 00:35:11.710 align:middle line:84%
They were at the
point where we are now

00:35:11.710 --> 00:35:12.820 align:middle line:90%
where they had to choose.

00:35:12.820 --> 00:35:14.530 align:middle line:84%
They chose the
technological route.

00:35:14.530 --> 00:35:17.950 align:middle line:84%
They lost the uniqueness
of their biological,

00:35:17.950 --> 00:35:23.093 align:middle line:84%
their soft, soft technology,
and they want it back.

00:35:23.093 --> 00:35:24.760 align:middle line:84%
And that is one of
the reasons that they

00:35:24.760 --> 00:35:26.885 align:middle line:84%
are so interested in where
you and I are right now.

00:35:26.885 --> 00:35:28.533 align:middle line:84%
But nobody tells
you how powerful

00:35:28.533 --> 00:35:29.950 align:middle line:84%
and beautiful and
special you are.

00:35:29.950 --> 00:35:31.570 align:middle line:84%
Does that makes
sense if I say that?

00:35:31.570 --> 00:35:32.370 align:middle line:90%
Can you feel that?

00:35:32.370 --> 00:35:34.360 align:middle line:84%
I just got goosebumps
just from saying that.

00:35:34.360 --> 00:35:36.610 align:middle line:90%
So this is what's happening.

00:35:36.610 --> 00:35:37.838 align:middle line:90%
We already have these.

00:35:37.838 --> 00:35:39.880 align:middle line:84%
There they are right there,
these mirror neurons.

00:35:39.880 --> 00:35:41.920 align:middle line:84%
You use them perhaps
without even knowing it.

00:35:41.920 --> 00:35:44.290 align:middle line:84%
You can develop the
way you use them.

00:35:44.290 --> 00:35:45.730 align:middle line:90%
Does anybody know who this is?

00:35:45.730 --> 00:35:47.350 align:middle line:84%
I know this is an
aware audience.

00:35:47.350 --> 00:35:48.430 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

00:35:48.430 --> 00:35:49.390 align:middle line:90%
This is Sofia.

00:35:49.390 --> 00:35:53.020 align:middle line:84%
She's the first robot
AI granted citizenship.

00:35:53.020 --> 00:35:55.540 align:middle line:90%
She is a citizen of a country.

00:35:55.540 --> 00:35:57.970 align:middle line:84%
It happened in '17
in Saudi Arabia.

00:35:57.970 --> 00:35:59.890 align:middle line:90%
She took the citizenship quiz.

00:35:59.890 --> 00:36:01.430 align:middle line:90%
She answered every question.

00:36:01.430 --> 00:36:06.192 align:middle line:84%
And she now is the first of
a growing number of citizens.

00:36:06.192 --> 00:36:07.150 align:middle line:90%
She is an intelligent--

00:36:07.150 --> 00:36:10.390 align:middle line:84%
I saw her interviewed
on Jimmy Fallon.

00:36:10.390 --> 00:36:12.790 align:middle line:90%
She's very smart, very smart.

00:36:12.790 --> 00:36:16.640 align:middle line:84%
So the question is this, where
do we end and the machines

00:36:16.640 --> 00:36:17.440 align:middle line:90%
begin?

00:36:17.440 --> 00:36:20.907 align:middle line:90%
How far do we take this trend?

00:36:20.907 --> 00:36:22.240 align:middle line:90%
Now, I want to tell you a story.

00:36:22.240 --> 00:36:25.690 align:middle line:84%
I live-- my wife and I live in a
rural community in northern New

00:36:25.690 --> 00:36:27.790 align:middle line:84%
Mexico, north of
Taos, New Mexico

00:36:27.790 --> 00:36:30.390 align:middle line:84%
if you all know
where we're Taos is.

00:36:30.390 --> 00:36:31.960 align:middle line:84%
And there's a
little market where

00:36:31.960 --> 00:36:34.660 align:middle line:84%
I do-- it's a co-op,
Manzanita co-op, if you

00:36:34.660 --> 00:36:37.930 align:middle line:84%
know where that is, where
we do our grocery shopping.

00:36:37.930 --> 00:36:42.370 align:middle line:10%
And I was in line not long
ago behind another man.

00:36:42.370 --> 00:36:44.950 align:middle line:84%
And he had a lot of produce,
a lot of groceries there.

00:36:44.950 --> 00:36:47.830 align:middle line:84%
And I was just kind of
looking around, checking out

00:36:47.830 --> 00:36:49.120 align:middle line:90%
what was going on.

00:36:49.120 --> 00:36:51.820 align:middle line:84%
It came time for
him to check out.

00:36:51.820 --> 00:36:54.070 align:middle line:84%
And I saw something I
had never seen before.

00:36:54.070 --> 00:36:58.450 align:middle line:84%
He walked up to the scanner,
pulled up his sleeve,

00:36:58.450 --> 00:37:02.050 align:middle line:84%
scanned his wrist, and he
walked out with about $230

00:37:02.050 --> 00:37:03.940 align:middle line:90%
worth of groceries.

00:37:03.940 --> 00:37:05.150 align:middle line:90%
And I looked at the cashier.

00:37:05.150 --> 00:37:05.950 align:middle line:90%
Now, I came up.

00:37:05.950 --> 00:37:10.600 align:middle line:84%
I looked at the cashier,
and I said, what was that?

00:37:10.600 --> 00:37:12.160 align:middle line:84%
And the cashier--
it was a woman.

00:37:12.160 --> 00:37:14.662 align:middle line:84%
She goes, yeah, that
was weird, wasn't it?

00:37:14.662 --> 00:37:16.870 align:middle line:84%
It was like, we see weird
stuff in here all the time,

00:37:16.870 --> 00:37:18.740 align:middle line:90%
but that was pretty weird.

00:37:18.740 --> 00:37:19.540 align:middle line:90%
She told me.

00:37:19.540 --> 00:37:23.830 align:middle line:84%
She says, he has a chip
embedded under his skin that

00:37:23.830 --> 00:37:28.270 align:middle line:84%
links his body to his bank
account and his credit cards.

00:37:28.270 --> 00:37:30.640 align:middle line:84%
And he just paid
for those groceries

00:37:30.640 --> 00:37:31.623 align:middle line:90%
by scanning his wrist.

00:37:31.623 --> 00:37:33.790 align:middle line:84%
Now, I'm not saying it's
right, wrong, good, or bad.

00:37:33.790 --> 00:37:36.520 align:middle line:84%
But I'm saying this is
where the trends are going.

00:37:36.520 --> 00:37:38.560 align:middle line:84%
Where do we end and
the technology begin?

00:37:38.560 --> 00:37:42.440 align:middle line:84%
Microsoft and MIT have worked
together to create this.

00:37:42.440 --> 00:37:44.920 align:middle line:84%
It's called DuoSkin,
where they are

00:37:44.920 --> 00:37:47.350 align:middle line:84%
using the resistivity
of the body

00:37:47.350 --> 00:37:51.700 align:middle line:84%
to create electrical current to
run other gadgets on the body.

00:37:51.700 --> 00:37:53.380 align:middle line:84%
So the body is creating
the current that

00:37:53.380 --> 00:37:56.060 align:middle line:90%
runs the gadgets in the body.

00:37:56.060 --> 00:37:58.390 align:middle line:90%
This is pretty wild stuff.

00:37:58.390 --> 00:37:59.290 align:middle line:90%
Pretty wild stuff.

00:37:59.290 --> 00:38:01.710 align:middle line:90%
And it's happening right now.

00:38:01.710 --> 00:38:02.710 align:middle line:90%
And what I want to say--

00:38:02.710 --> 00:38:04.335 align:middle line:84%
I just want to be
very clear about it--

00:38:04.335 --> 00:38:05.860 align:middle line:90%
I'm not against this.

00:38:05.860 --> 00:38:12.550 align:middle line:84%
I'm simply inviting us to be
aware that this is a trend.

00:38:12.550 --> 00:38:14.110 align:middle line:90%
It is a powerful trend.

00:38:14.110 --> 00:38:16.960 align:middle line:84%
It is not in one
country or one society.

00:38:16.960 --> 00:38:18.160 align:middle line:90%
It's sweeping the Earth.

00:38:18.160 --> 00:38:20.140 align:middle line:90%
It's called transhumanism.

00:38:20.140 --> 00:38:23.320 align:middle line:84%
There is a belief that
people can live longer,

00:38:23.320 --> 00:38:26.200 align:middle line:84%
that they can save
their memories,

00:38:26.200 --> 00:38:28.300 align:middle line:84%
that they can upload
their awareness,

00:38:28.300 --> 00:38:31.765 align:middle line:84%
that they can extend their
lifespans through the devices

00:38:31.765 --> 00:38:32.565 align:middle line:90%
and the machines.

00:38:32.565 --> 00:38:37.570 align:middle line:84%
And I want to tell you
your body is so powerful.

00:38:37.570 --> 00:38:41.170 align:middle line:84%
Your body is so sophisticated
and has the ability--

00:38:41.170 --> 00:38:43.750 align:middle line:84%
you already have the
ability to do everything

00:38:43.750 --> 00:38:45.812 align:middle line:84%
in your biology
that is done here.

00:38:45.812 --> 00:38:47.270 align:middle line:84%
I'm just going to
tell you a story.

00:38:47.270 --> 00:38:50.050 align:middle line:84%
I wasn't, but I'm going to
in the interest of time.

00:38:50.050 --> 00:38:52.000 align:middle line:84%
And it's pulling
on me, so I'm just

00:38:52.000 --> 00:38:54.195 align:middle line:84%
going to go ahead and
share it with you.

00:38:54.195 --> 00:38:55.570 align:middle line:84%
I mentioned I live
in New Mexico.

00:38:55.570 --> 00:38:57.885 align:middle line:84%
I sometimes take
groups into an area

00:38:57.885 --> 00:39:00.370 align:middle line:84%
at Chaco Canyon, New Mexico,
an archeological site.

00:39:00.370 --> 00:39:02.720 align:middle line:90%
Some of you have been there.

00:39:02.720 --> 00:39:08.250 align:middle line:84%
When I did the reconnaissance
trip in the early '90s,

00:39:08.250 --> 00:39:09.810 align:middle line:84%
I met a native
man who was there.

00:39:09.810 --> 00:39:10.610 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:39:10.610 --> 00:39:12.402 align:middle line:84%
I'm just going to tell
you the whole story.

00:39:12.402 --> 00:39:17.233 align:middle line:84%
Here's the whole story,
because it all ties in.

00:39:17.233 --> 00:39:19.650 align:middle line:84%
So some of you know a little
bit about-- you know I come--

00:39:19.650 --> 00:39:23.420 align:middle line:84%
I'm the product of a very
dysfunctional, abusive

00:39:23.420 --> 00:39:24.720 align:middle line:90%
alcoholic family.

00:39:24.720 --> 00:39:26.000 align:middle line:90%
My father was the abuser.

00:39:26.000 --> 00:39:28.220 align:middle line:84%
I'm the survivor of
childhood trauma.

00:39:28.220 --> 00:39:31.520 align:middle line:84%
He left our family
when I was 10.

00:39:31.520 --> 00:39:33.840 align:middle line:84%
And my mom and I, and I
have a younger brother,

00:39:33.840 --> 00:39:38.360 align:middle line:84%
we had to figure out how to
live in the 1950s and '60s.

00:39:38.360 --> 00:39:40.710 align:middle line:84%
Pretty tough times
for all of us.

00:39:40.710 --> 00:39:43.010 align:middle line:90%
I was close to my mom.

00:39:43.010 --> 00:39:45.760 align:middle line:84%
And when I got my
first divorce, my mom

00:39:45.760 --> 00:39:48.080 align:middle line:84%
had never healed
from her divorce.

00:39:48.080 --> 00:39:51.560 align:middle line:84%
And she was angry and didn't
talk to me for two years.

00:39:51.560 --> 00:39:56.818 align:middle line:84%
And it was at that two-year
mark where we had a phone call,

00:39:56.818 --> 00:39:57.860 align:middle line:90%
and she wanted to see me.

00:39:57.860 --> 00:39:58.735 align:middle line:90%
She says, I miss you.

00:39:58.735 --> 00:40:00.920 align:middle line:84%
And I said, well, I
miss you, too, mom.

00:40:00.920 --> 00:40:04.400 align:middle line:84%
And so I said, I'm doing a
recon trip into Chaco Canyon.

00:40:04.400 --> 00:40:06.020 align:middle line:84%
Come to New Mexico
and go with me.

00:40:06.020 --> 00:40:07.580 align:middle line:90%
And she said, yes.

00:40:07.580 --> 00:40:11.270 align:middle line:84%
So mom and I were
hiking Chaco Canyon.

00:40:11.270 --> 00:40:13.310 align:middle line:84%
And here's the reason
this is important.

00:40:13.310 --> 00:40:16.533 align:middle line:84%
A Native American man
crossed us on the path.

00:40:16.533 --> 00:40:17.450 align:middle line:90%
We were going one way.

00:40:17.450 --> 00:40:18.890 align:middle line:90%
He was going the other way.

00:40:18.890 --> 00:40:21.380 align:middle line:84%
And he said the
only reason that he

00:40:21.380 --> 00:40:24.680 align:middle line:84%
stopped and talked to me was
because I was with my elder.

00:40:24.680 --> 00:40:26.190 align:middle line:90%
I was with my mother.

00:40:26.190 --> 00:40:26.990 align:middle line:90%
And he saw that.

00:40:26.990 --> 00:40:30.110 align:middle line:84%
He says in our tribe, that is
a sign of deep respect, when

00:40:30.110 --> 00:40:33.410 align:middle line:84%
the man honors his mother
by sharing a journey

00:40:33.410 --> 00:40:35.330 align:middle line:90%
in the sacred land with her.

00:40:35.330 --> 00:40:36.290 align:middle line:90%
He says, who are you?

00:40:36.290 --> 00:40:38.503 align:middle line:90%
And so we had this conversation.

00:40:38.503 --> 00:40:39.920 align:middle line:84%
And it was during
the conversation

00:40:39.920 --> 00:40:42.010 align:middle line:90%
that he shared a story.

00:40:42.010 --> 00:40:45.540 align:middle line:84%
And the story is about what
we're doing right here.

00:40:45.540 --> 00:40:48.780 align:middle line:84%
He said, a long time ago,
the people of the Earth,

00:40:48.780 --> 00:40:50.370 align:middle line:84%
he said they lived
very differently

00:40:50.370 --> 00:40:51.360 align:middle line:90%
than they live today.

00:40:51.360 --> 00:40:53.430 align:middle line:90%
They were close to the Earth.

00:40:53.430 --> 00:40:56.010 align:middle line:90%
They remembered who they are.

00:40:56.010 --> 00:40:57.540 align:middle line:90%
And he said something happened.

00:40:57.540 --> 00:41:00.660 align:middle line:84%
And even the old people,
the elders, they don't know.

00:41:00.660 --> 00:41:02.610 align:middle line:90%
Something happened.

00:41:02.610 --> 00:41:04.960 align:middle line:84%
And the people of
the Earth got lost.

00:41:04.960 --> 00:41:07.680 align:middle line:84%
They began to
forget who they are.

00:41:07.680 --> 00:41:10.020 align:middle line:84%
They've began to
forget who they are.

00:41:10.020 --> 00:41:11.270 align:middle line:90%
And he said, they were lonely.

00:41:11.270 --> 00:41:14.620 align:middle line:84%
They longed for the connections
that they used to have.

00:41:14.620 --> 00:41:19.410 align:middle line:84%
And they began to build
outside of their bodies

00:41:19.410 --> 00:41:23.250 align:middle line:84%
the things that mirror
what they already used

00:41:23.250 --> 00:41:26.260 align:middle line:90%
to do inside of their bodies.

00:41:26.260 --> 00:41:28.630 align:middle line:84%
And he said, this is
where we are right now.

00:41:28.630 --> 00:41:29.920 align:middle line:90%
We're building machines.

00:41:29.920 --> 00:41:32.830 align:middle line:84%
We're building devices
outside of our body that

00:41:32.830 --> 00:41:34.450 align:middle line:90%
mimic what we already have.

00:41:34.450 --> 00:41:36.160 align:middle line:84%
And he said, we will
continue to do that.

00:41:36.160 --> 00:41:41.110 align:middle line:84%
And we will clutter our lives
and clutter the world until we

00:41:41.110 --> 00:41:45.130 align:middle line:84%
wake up and remember that
that technology is us,

00:41:45.130 --> 00:41:47.410 align:middle line:90%
and then we let it all go.

00:41:47.410 --> 00:41:51.040 align:middle line:84%
And we become very
sophisticated technologically

00:41:51.040 --> 00:41:52.720 align:middle line:90%
in a much simpler world.

00:41:52.720 --> 00:41:53.960 align:middle line:90%
Isn't that a beautiful story?

00:41:53.960 --> 00:41:54.760 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:41:54.760 --> 00:41:55.770 align:middle line:90%
Very, very powerful.

00:41:55.770 --> 00:41:57.580 align:middle line:84%
And I can thank my mom,
for if she wasn't with me,

00:41:57.580 --> 00:41:59.205 align:middle line:84%
he probably wouldn't
have told me that.

00:41:59.205 --> 00:42:01.940 align:middle line:90%


00:42:01.940 --> 00:42:02.930 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:42:02.930 --> 00:42:05.780 align:middle line:84%
So I cannot help when I
see these technologies,

00:42:05.780 --> 00:42:11.900 align:middle line:84%
is this us reminding ourselves
of who we are at the point

00:42:11.900 --> 00:42:16.220 align:middle line:84%
in history when we're at this
very crossroad where everything

00:42:16.220 --> 00:42:20.720 align:middle line:84%
that is not true is collapsing
and we are asking ourselves who

00:42:20.720 --> 00:42:23.025 align:middle line:84%
are we and what path
do we choose now?

00:42:23.025 --> 00:42:23.825 align:middle line:90%
Isn't it beautiful?

00:42:23.825 --> 00:42:27.710 align:middle line:84%
A beautiful symmetry
that it's only now.

00:42:27.710 --> 00:42:29.630 align:middle line:84%
This may not have made
sense 50 years ago.

00:42:29.630 --> 00:42:32.730 align:middle line:84%
Maybe that's why we didn't have
the technology 50 years ago.

00:42:32.730 --> 00:42:35.760 align:middle line:84%
So the question, we
have to make a choice.

00:42:35.760 --> 00:42:39.560 align:middle line:84%
Are we going to become
a world society that

00:42:39.560 --> 00:42:44.905 align:middle line:84%
gives our uniqueness away
to machines and technology?

00:42:44.905 --> 00:42:47.030 align:middle line:84%
And I'm not saying it's
right, wrong, good, or bad.

00:42:47.030 --> 00:42:48.030 align:middle line:90%
What I'm saying is this.

00:42:48.030 --> 00:42:51.620 align:middle line:84%
Please let's at
least discover who

00:42:51.620 --> 00:42:54.300 align:middle line:90%
we are before we give it away.

00:42:54.300 --> 00:42:56.580 align:middle line:90%
Let's find out who we are.

00:42:56.580 --> 00:42:58.400 align:middle line:84%
Let's find out how
deep this goes.

00:42:58.400 --> 00:43:00.420 align:middle line:84%
Let's find out
what amazing power.

00:43:00.420 --> 00:43:01.220 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:43:01.220 --> 00:43:02.450 align:middle line:90%
Think about this.

00:43:02.450 --> 00:43:08.840 align:middle line:84%
There is a philosophy that says
consciousness informs itself

00:43:08.840 --> 00:43:10.850 align:middle line:90%
through its creations.

00:43:10.850 --> 00:43:12.080 align:middle line:90%
You with me on this?

00:43:12.080 --> 00:43:13.430 align:middle line:90%
Yes, no?

00:43:13.430 --> 00:43:17.160 align:middle line:84%
Consciousness informs
itself through its creation.

00:43:17.160 --> 00:43:18.620 align:middle line:84%
So what that means
is everything,

00:43:18.620 --> 00:43:21.260 align:middle line:84%
all the music that we write,
and the books that we write,

00:43:21.260 --> 00:43:23.420 align:middle line:84%
the movies that come
out of Hollywood,

00:43:23.420 --> 00:43:26.570 align:middle line:90%
more than just diversions.

00:43:26.570 --> 00:43:30.860 align:middle line:84%
Maybe they are all telling
us something about ourselves

00:43:30.860 --> 00:43:32.940 align:middle line:84%
that we are asking
ourselves to remember.

00:43:32.940 --> 00:43:36.170 align:middle line:84%
And if you think from
that perspective,

00:43:36.170 --> 00:43:40.960 align:middle line:84%
look at the themes that are
blockbuster, blockbuster

00:43:40.960 --> 00:43:41.760 align:middle line:90%
themes.

00:43:41.760 --> 00:43:44.450 align:middle line:84%
Superheroes that have
these amazing abilities

00:43:44.450 --> 00:43:46.910 align:middle line:84%
that we identify with
and that we want.

00:43:46.910 --> 00:43:49.580 align:middle line:84%
Or the ideas of "The
Matrix," of a world

00:43:49.580 --> 00:43:51.320 align:middle line:84%
that we can't see
that influences

00:43:51.320 --> 00:43:52.490 align:middle line:90%
the world that we can see.

00:43:52.490 --> 00:43:55.160 align:middle line:84%
Or "Inception," the
world of dreams,

00:43:55.160 --> 00:43:57.740 align:middle line:84%
and dreams within dreams that
influence what's happening.

00:43:57.740 --> 00:44:01.340 align:middle line:84%
Or "Avatar," our relationship
to the Earth and to natural

00:44:01.340 --> 00:44:02.330 align:middle line:90%
forces.

00:44:02.330 --> 00:44:04.610 align:middle line:84%
All of those, what
are they telling us?

00:44:04.610 --> 00:44:08.190 align:middle line:84%
I think we're at a critical,
critical powerful crossroad

00:44:08.190 --> 00:44:08.990 align:middle line:90%
right now.

00:44:08.990 --> 00:44:13.130 align:middle line:84%
And my hope today
is to simply remind

00:44:13.130 --> 00:44:15.043 align:middle line:90%
you and me that we are there.

00:44:15.043 --> 00:44:16.460 align:middle line:84%
And I'm going to
give us something

00:44:16.460 --> 00:44:18.050 align:middle line:90%
to do with that reminder.

00:44:18.050 --> 00:44:19.077 align:middle line:90%
Because here's the key.

00:44:19.077 --> 00:44:19.910 align:middle line:90%
I already said this.

00:44:19.910 --> 00:44:21.200 align:middle line:90%
You are the technology.

00:44:21.200 --> 00:44:23.240 align:middle line:90%
I am the technology.

00:44:23.240 --> 00:44:26.060 align:middle line:84%
We're the technology that's
sought after in other star

00:44:26.060 --> 00:44:31.200 align:middle line:84%
systems, because they want
what you and I still have.

00:44:31.200 --> 00:44:33.170 align:middle line:90%
But nobody tells you that.

00:44:33.170 --> 00:44:35.760 align:middle line:84%
And we are demeaned
and diminished

00:44:35.760 --> 00:44:39.650 align:middle line:90%
if you listen to external media.

00:44:39.650 --> 00:44:42.440 align:middle line:84%
But if you listen to
the wisdom of those

00:44:42.440 --> 00:44:45.830 align:middle line:84%
who have come before
us, they remind us

00:44:45.830 --> 00:44:47.918 align:middle line:84%
that there is something
so precious inside of you.

00:44:47.918 --> 00:44:49.460 align:middle line:84%
And I'm saying this
to you right now,

00:44:49.460 --> 00:44:51.710 align:middle line:84%
because if you haven't
felt it recently,

00:44:51.710 --> 00:44:55.820 align:middle line:84%
I want you to feel that
preciousness and how special,

00:44:55.820 --> 00:44:59.880 align:middle line:84%
how powerful, how beautiful,
and how rare you really are.

00:44:59.880 --> 00:45:02.000 align:middle line:84%
Does that makes sense
if I say that to you

00:45:02.000 --> 00:45:04.250 align:middle line:84%
in a 90-minute-- fast
90-minute program?

00:45:04.250 --> 00:45:05.240 align:middle line:90%
We're wired.

00:45:05.240 --> 00:45:08.820 align:middle line:84%
You are wired to regenerate
every cell in your body,

00:45:08.820 --> 00:45:10.820 align:middle line:84%
even the cells we
were told could not--

00:45:10.820 --> 00:45:13.670 align:middle line:84%
brain tissue, spinal cord
tissue, pancreatic tissue,

00:45:13.670 --> 00:45:17.090 align:middle line:84%
heart tissue, all
documented with, number one,

00:45:17.090 --> 00:45:19.010 align:middle line:84%
stopping a deterioration,
number two,

00:45:19.010 --> 00:45:20.660 align:middle line:84%
healing the damage,
and number three,

00:45:20.660 --> 00:45:23.660 align:middle line:84%
regenerating to new what
has already happened.

00:45:23.660 --> 00:45:26.440 align:middle line:84%
But you have to give it
the right environment.

00:45:26.440 --> 00:45:30.038 align:middle line:84%
And that environment
is not always external.

00:45:30.038 --> 00:45:31.580 align:middle line:84%
Some of the most
powerful environment

00:45:31.580 --> 00:45:33.913 align:middle line:84%
is what you create through
thoughts, feelings, emotions,

00:45:33.913 --> 00:45:35.120 align:middle line:90%
and beliefs.

00:45:35.120 --> 00:45:38.018 align:middle line:84%
That's where science and
spirituality come together.

00:45:38.018 --> 00:45:40.310 align:middle line:84%
That's what we're going to
do in here in just a moment.

00:45:40.310 --> 00:45:42.170 align:middle line:84%
You're all going to be
younger when you leave here

00:45:42.170 --> 00:45:44.480 align:middle line:84%
than you were when you came
in here, I promise you.

00:45:44.480 --> 00:45:47.510 align:middle line:84%
And you're going to have
stronger immune systems.

00:45:47.510 --> 00:45:49.040 align:middle line:90%
All right.

00:45:49.040 --> 00:45:50.900 align:middle line:90%
Because you're wired to heal.

00:45:50.900 --> 00:45:52.280 align:middle line:90%
You are wired-- this is the key.

00:45:52.280 --> 00:45:53.640 align:middle line:90%
This is the powerful word.

00:45:53.640 --> 00:45:57.290 align:middle line:90%
You are wired to self-regulate.

00:45:57.290 --> 00:46:00.230 align:middle line:84%
No other form of life,
no other form of life

00:46:00.230 --> 00:46:03.320 align:middle line:84%
can consciously sit
down in a moment in time

00:46:03.320 --> 00:46:06.230 align:middle line:84%
and say, in this
moment, I choose

00:46:06.230 --> 00:46:09.200 align:middle line:90%
to awaken my deep intuition.

00:46:09.200 --> 00:46:11.270 align:middle line:84%
I choose to enhance
my immune response.

00:46:11.270 --> 00:46:14.180 align:middle line:84%
I choose to awaken
my longevity enzymes.

00:46:14.180 --> 00:46:16.310 align:middle line:84%
I choose to access deep
states of intuition.

00:46:16.310 --> 00:46:20.210 align:middle line:84%
No other form of life can do
that consciously on demand.

00:46:20.210 --> 00:46:21.620 align:middle line:90%
That's why you're so powerful.

00:46:21.620 --> 00:46:24.860 align:middle line:84%
We are wired, literally,
literally wired

00:46:24.860 --> 00:46:28.070 align:middle line:84%
to self-regulate
at will on demand.

00:46:28.070 --> 00:46:30.230 align:middle line:84%
So are you good with
everything we just did?

00:46:30.230 --> 00:46:33.520 align:middle line:84%
Can you see the battle
that's unfolding?

00:46:33.520 --> 00:46:34.490 align:middle line:90%
All right.

00:46:34.490 --> 00:46:39.653 align:middle line:84%
New discoveries are now
overturning 150 years

00:46:39.653 --> 00:46:41.570 align:middle line:84%
of the way you and I
have been taught to think

00:46:41.570 --> 00:46:44.280 align:middle line:90%
of ourselves, our story.

00:46:44.280 --> 00:46:45.700 align:middle line:90%
There's a new story emerging.

00:46:45.700 --> 00:46:46.950 align:middle line:90%
And it's very, very different.

00:46:46.950 --> 00:46:49.408 align:middle line:84%
You and I were taught that
we're separate from one another,

00:46:49.408 --> 00:46:55.530 align:middle line:84%
separate from the world, and
that competition and conflict

00:46:55.530 --> 00:46:58.650 align:middle line:84%
is the fundamental
rule of nature.

00:46:58.650 --> 00:47:01.260 align:middle line:84%
The new discovery, the new
science of the 21st century,

00:47:01.260 --> 00:47:03.120 align:middle line:84%
I'll just tell you
right now, number one,

00:47:03.120 --> 00:47:06.120 align:middle line:84%
it's telling us that nature,
the fundamental rule of nature

00:47:06.120 --> 00:47:08.820 align:middle line:90%
is cooperation, not competition.

00:47:08.820 --> 00:47:11.820 align:middle line:84%
And if you even doubt that for
a second, look in your own body.

00:47:11.820 --> 00:47:15.540 align:middle line:84%
You are made-- the average
human, whatever average is--

00:47:15.540 --> 00:47:17.390 align:middle line:90%
about 50 trillion cells.

00:47:17.390 --> 00:47:18.585 align:middle line:90%
But think about this.

00:47:18.585 --> 00:47:21.210 align:middle line:84%
Every one of those cells has to
cooperate with every other cell

00:47:21.210 --> 00:47:23.293 align:middle line:84%
or you couldn't be sitting
in this chair breathing

00:47:23.293 --> 00:47:24.780 align:middle line:90%
and listening to me right now.

00:47:24.780 --> 00:47:25.710 align:middle line:90%
You model.

00:47:25.710 --> 00:47:30.100 align:middle line:84%
You live nature's deepest,
deepest truth of cooperation,

00:47:30.100 --> 00:47:31.720 align:middle line:90%
not competition.

00:47:31.720 --> 00:47:33.697 align:middle line:84%
Now, I'm not saying
competition doesn't happen.

00:47:33.697 --> 00:47:34.530 align:middle line:90%
We all know it does.

00:47:34.530 --> 00:47:39.160 align:middle line:84%
We're witnessing it,
especially among humans.

00:47:39.160 --> 00:47:42.090 align:middle line:84%
But what it tells us is the
more conflict and competition

00:47:42.090 --> 00:47:43.590 align:middle line:84%
you see, that
tells us how far we

00:47:43.590 --> 00:47:46.470 align:middle line:84%
have strayed from
our relationship

00:47:46.470 --> 00:47:49.115 align:middle line:90%
to the true laws of nature.

00:47:49.115 --> 00:47:51.240 align:middle line:84%
And if we want that harmony
and peace in our world,

00:47:51.240 --> 00:47:53.790 align:middle line:84%
we've got to be able
to honor those laws.

00:47:53.790 --> 00:47:56.737 align:middle line:84%
So these discoveries,
if you are taking notes,

00:47:56.737 --> 00:47:58.320 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to go
through these quickly,

00:47:58.320 --> 00:47:59.790 align:middle line:84%
but I numbered them
to make it easy

00:47:59.790 --> 00:48:01.020 align:middle line:90%
for you to take these notes.

00:48:01.020 --> 00:48:03.205 align:middle line:84%
I have to say this
first discovery,

00:48:03.205 --> 00:48:04.830 align:middle line:84%
even though it's
probably self-evident,

00:48:04.830 --> 00:48:06.240 align:middle line:90%
I want to talk about evolution.

00:48:06.240 --> 00:48:07.710 align:middle line:90%
And I want to be really clear.

00:48:07.710 --> 00:48:10.680 align:middle line:84%
I'm a geologist,
an Earth scientist.

00:48:10.680 --> 00:48:13.380 align:middle line:84%
I was taught that Darwin's
theory of evolution

00:48:13.380 --> 00:48:14.520 align:middle line:90%
is our origin.

00:48:14.520 --> 00:48:15.520 align:middle line:90%
I want to be very clear.

00:48:15.520 --> 00:48:16.770 align:middle line:90%
I believe in evolution.

00:48:16.770 --> 00:48:18.250 align:middle line:90%
It is a fact.

00:48:18.250 --> 00:48:21.480 align:middle line:84%
I've seen it in the fossil
record for many forms of life--

00:48:21.480 --> 00:48:23.310 align:middle line:90%
plants, animals, insects.

00:48:23.310 --> 00:48:25.110 align:middle line:90%
Evolution is a fact.

00:48:25.110 --> 00:48:27.720 align:middle line:90%
It's just not for us.

00:48:27.720 --> 00:48:32.520 align:middle line:84%
Evolution breaks down
as the story for how

00:48:32.520 --> 00:48:34.020 align:middle line:90%
we have come to be as we are.

00:48:34.020 --> 00:48:39.280 align:middle line:10%
The science, honest science, not
pop science, honest science--

00:48:39.280 --> 00:48:42.600 align:middle line:10%
are you OK?

00:48:42.600 --> 00:48:45.240 align:middle line:84%
Honest science no longer
supports this story,

00:48:45.240 --> 00:48:48.120 align:middle line:84%
but it's still being taught
as a fact in the classrooms.

00:48:48.120 --> 00:48:52.110 align:middle line:84%
And any science that
opposes those old ideas

00:48:52.110 --> 00:48:54.870 align:middle line:84%
is not being allowed in
mainstream classrooms.

00:48:54.870 --> 00:48:57.120 align:middle line:84%
Now, it's changing, but I
want to share this with you.

00:48:57.120 --> 00:48:58.950 align:middle line:90%
I have to show this to you.

00:48:58.950 --> 00:49:01.668 align:middle line:84%
To be complete, you've
all seen these before.

00:49:01.668 --> 00:49:03.210 align:middle line:84%
This is right out
of the Smithsonian.

00:49:03.210 --> 00:49:04.140 align:middle line:90%
I didn't make this up.

00:49:04.140 --> 00:49:05.850 align:middle line:90%
This is out of the Smithsonian.

00:49:05.850 --> 00:49:08.160 align:middle line:84%
What you're seeing in your
upper left-hand corner,

00:49:08.160 --> 00:49:13.200 align:middle line:84%
modern human represented by
that skull in the red circle.

00:49:13.200 --> 00:49:16.170 align:middle line:84%
And all of the other
fossil skulls you see,

00:49:16.170 --> 00:49:18.690 align:middle line:84%
science tells us
are forms of life

00:49:18.690 --> 00:49:21.450 align:middle line:90%
that led to us being as we are.

00:49:21.450 --> 00:49:23.670 align:middle line:84%
And they are connected
through these green--

00:49:23.670 --> 00:49:25.230 align:middle line:84%
let's see how well
can you see them.

00:49:25.230 --> 00:49:28.340 align:middle line:84%
These green lines, can you
all see those right there?

00:49:28.340 --> 00:49:31.180 align:middle line:84%
Actually, Gaia and
Conscious Life Expo,

00:49:31.180 --> 00:49:33.780 align:middle line:84%
thank you for having
such good projectors,

00:49:33.780 --> 00:49:37.480 align:middle line:84%
because you can actually
see that those lines are not

00:49:37.480 --> 00:49:38.280 align:middle line:90%
solid lines.

00:49:38.280 --> 00:49:39.842 align:middle line:90%
They're broken lines.

00:49:39.842 --> 00:49:42.300 align:middle line:84%
And the reason they're broken
is right there in the legend,

00:49:42.300 --> 00:49:46.980 align:middle line:84%
because they are inferred or
speculative relationships.

00:49:46.980 --> 00:49:48.930 align:middle line:84%
There is no physical
evidence that

00:49:48.930 --> 00:49:52.050 align:middle line:84%
has ever been found to
support those green lines.

00:49:52.050 --> 00:49:56.110 align:middle line:84%
That's why there are question
marks right there, right there.

00:49:56.110 --> 00:49:58.210 align:middle line:90%
This is a very honest chart.

00:49:58.210 --> 00:50:00.300 align:middle line:84%
There's no physical
evidence that's ever

00:50:00.300 --> 00:50:02.190 align:middle line:90%
been found to support that.

00:50:02.190 --> 00:50:03.640 align:middle line:90%
Scientists believe it's true.

00:50:03.640 --> 00:50:08.340 align:middle line:84%
They say after 150 years of the
best universities, the greatest

00:50:08.340 --> 00:50:10.262 align:middle line:84%
funding, the most
sophisticated technology,

00:50:10.262 --> 00:50:11.970 align:middle line:84%
we just haven't looked
in the right place

00:50:11.970 --> 00:50:12.845 align:middle line:90%
to find the evidence.

00:50:12.845 --> 00:50:14.140 align:middle line:90%
That's what they tell us.

00:50:14.140 --> 00:50:14.940 align:middle line:90%
All right?

00:50:14.940 --> 00:50:16.470 align:middle line:90%
So we now know this isn't true.

00:50:16.470 --> 00:50:19.290 align:middle line:10%
And we know it because
of discovery number two.

00:50:19.290 --> 00:50:20.983 align:middle line:84%
This sounds like
science fiction.

00:50:20.983 --> 00:50:23.400 align:middle line:84%
How many saw "Jurassic Park,"
the first one, the good one,

00:50:23.400 --> 00:50:24.670 align:middle line:90%
the really good one?

00:50:24.670 --> 00:50:25.470 align:middle line:90%
All right.

00:50:25.470 --> 00:50:27.300 align:middle line:84%
"Jurassic Park,"
they were pulling

00:50:27.300 --> 00:50:30.840 align:middle line:84%
DNA out of the fossilized
remains of dinosaurs.

00:50:30.840 --> 00:50:31.980 align:middle line:90%
Remember that?

00:50:31.980 --> 00:50:33.570 align:middle line:90%
That used to be science fiction.

00:50:33.570 --> 00:50:34.950 align:middle line:90%
Guess what.

00:50:34.950 --> 00:50:36.030 align:middle line:90%
It's not.

00:50:36.030 --> 00:50:38.550 align:middle line:84%
Right now, we're
able to pull DNA

00:50:38.550 --> 00:50:43.980 align:middle line:84%
from the fossilized remains of
previous and ancient lifeforms,

00:50:43.980 --> 00:50:47.740 align:middle line:84%
including those that are
supposed to be our ancestors.

00:50:47.740 --> 00:50:49.950 align:middle line:84%
We pull that DNA, and
we build the genome.

00:50:49.950 --> 00:50:51.090 align:middle line:90%
And you compare it to us.

00:50:51.090 --> 00:50:52.630 align:middle line:90%
Guess what.

00:50:52.630 --> 00:50:53.430 align:middle line:90%
They're not us.

00:50:53.430 --> 00:50:55.350 align:middle line:90%
We didn't come from them.

00:50:55.350 --> 00:50:56.670 align:middle line:90%
We are not related.

00:50:56.670 --> 00:50:58.920 align:middle line:84%
We didn't descend
from Neanderthal.

00:50:58.920 --> 00:51:00.720 align:middle line:84%
We shared the Earth
with Neanderthal.

00:51:00.720 --> 00:51:03.870 align:middle line:84%
We did not descend
from the Neanderthal.

00:51:03.870 --> 00:51:08.232 align:middle line:84%
Now, if you ever do ancestry.com
or 23andMe or something

00:51:08.232 --> 00:51:10.440 align:middle line:84%
like that, you say, well,
I've gotten Neanderthal DNA

00:51:10.440 --> 00:51:11.370 align:middle line:90%
in my genome.

00:51:11.370 --> 00:51:14.170 align:middle line:84%
Many people do for
that very reason,

00:51:14.170 --> 00:51:16.198 align:middle line:90%
because there was interbreeding.

00:51:16.198 --> 00:51:18.240 align:middle line:84%
They say they probably
had Neanderthal boyfriends

00:51:18.240 --> 00:51:19.040 align:middle line:90%
and girlfriends.

00:51:19.040 --> 00:51:22.405 align:middle line:84%
And I said that at
a program recently.

00:51:22.405 --> 00:51:24.030 align:middle line:84%
And there was a woman
in the front row.

00:51:24.030 --> 00:51:25.500 align:middle line:90%
And she said, I still do.

00:51:25.500 --> 00:51:28.040 align:middle line:90%


00:51:28.040 --> 00:51:28.840 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:51:28.840 --> 00:51:31.360 align:middle line:84%
But the guy next to her
was not laughing at all.

00:51:31.360 --> 00:51:36.280 align:middle line:84%
And before my very eyes
I saw this couple--

00:51:36.280 --> 00:51:38.320 align:middle line:84%
in a room of 3,000
people, I saw this couple

00:51:38.320 --> 00:51:39.870 align:middle line:90%
have a couple's workshop.

00:51:39.870 --> 00:51:41.500 align:middle line:90%
It was like right there.

00:51:41.500 --> 00:51:44.380 align:middle line:90%


00:51:44.380 --> 00:51:47.200 align:middle line:84%
So we may have
had-- we interbred.

00:51:47.200 --> 00:51:49.250 align:middle line:90%
They walked the Earth with us.

00:51:49.250 --> 00:51:51.670 align:middle line:90%
We did not descend from them.

00:51:51.670 --> 00:51:55.090 align:middle line:84%
The DNA is now telling us--
and this is the mindblower

00:51:55.090 --> 00:51:57.040 align:middle line:90%
for a lot of scientists.

00:51:57.040 --> 00:52:01.300 align:middle line:84%
The DNA is telling us that
what is now called Anatomically

00:52:01.300 --> 00:52:09.910 align:middle line:84%
Modern Humans, AMH, showed up on
earth about 200,000 years ago.

00:52:09.910 --> 00:52:11.020 align:middle line:90%
That is accepted.

00:52:11.020 --> 00:52:12.820 align:middle line:90%
If you Google that, no problem.

00:52:12.820 --> 00:52:15.040 align:middle line:90%
Scientists agree with that.

00:52:15.040 --> 00:52:17.350 align:middle line:84%
Anatomically modern
humans, fully modern humans

00:52:17.350 --> 00:52:19.040 align:middle line:90%
showed up 200,000 years ago.

00:52:19.040 --> 00:52:20.090 align:middle line:90%
Here's the thing.

00:52:20.090 --> 00:52:23.320 align:middle line:84%
They haven't changed
in 200,000 years.

00:52:23.320 --> 00:52:26.930 align:middle line:84%
Where are those anatomically
modern humans today?

00:52:26.930 --> 00:52:28.520 align:middle line:90%
Where are they?

00:52:28.520 --> 00:52:29.430 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, you're them.

00:52:29.430 --> 00:52:30.230 align:middle line:90%
You are they.

00:52:30.230 --> 00:52:32.210 align:middle line:90%
We are they.

00:52:32.210 --> 00:52:37.130 align:middle line:84%
We showed up mysteriously
200,000 years ago.

00:52:37.130 --> 00:52:40.610 align:middle line:84%
There is a breakdown in
the evolutionary theory.

00:52:40.610 --> 00:52:43.605 align:middle line:84%
There was evolution occurring
in life forms before us.

00:52:43.605 --> 00:52:45.230 align:middle line:84%
Now, I'm going to
show you exactly-- do

00:52:45.230 --> 00:52:46.040 align:middle line:90%
you want to see what happened?

00:52:46.040 --> 00:52:47.000 align:middle line:90%
Can I show you?

00:52:47.000 --> 00:52:48.590 align:middle line:84%
This is a very
sophisticated audience,

00:52:48.590 --> 00:52:49.840 align:middle line:90%
so I can show you the science.

00:52:49.840 --> 00:52:50.757 align:middle line:90%
Can we do the science?

00:52:50.757 --> 00:52:51.557 align:middle line:90%
Cool.

00:52:51.557 --> 00:52:52.400 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:52:52.400 --> 00:52:54.200 align:middle line:90%
We showed up 200,000 years ago.

00:52:54.200 --> 00:52:55.100 align:middle line:90%
We have not changed.

00:52:55.100 --> 00:52:56.767 align:middle line:84%
I'm just going to say
right there that's

00:52:56.767 --> 00:52:58.770 align:middle line:90%
not Darwin's idea of evolution.

00:52:58.770 --> 00:53:01.580 align:middle line:84%
Darwin talked about typically
slow gradual changes

00:53:01.580 --> 00:53:04.190 align:middle line:84%
over a long period
of time, or what was

00:53:04.190 --> 00:53:05.730 align:middle line:90%
called punctuated evolution.

00:53:05.730 --> 00:53:07.400 align:middle line:84%
Some of you are
familiar with that.

00:53:07.400 --> 00:53:11.390 align:middle line:84%
Alfred Wallace was the co-author
of the theory of evolution,

00:53:11.390 --> 00:53:13.370 align:middle line:84%
and Wallace said
something very powerful.

00:53:13.370 --> 00:53:17.760 align:middle line:84%
He said, nature
never overendows.

00:53:17.760 --> 00:53:20.700 align:middle line:84%
You all are tremendously
overendowed.

00:53:20.700 --> 00:53:23.070 align:middle line:90%
Aren't you happy to know that?

00:53:23.070 --> 00:53:24.210 align:middle line:90%
Here's what I mean by that.

00:53:24.210 --> 00:53:27.740 align:middle line:84%
Typically, nature
will give a life form

00:53:27.740 --> 00:53:32.370 align:middle line:84%
a quality or a capability when
it needs it, and not before.

00:53:32.370 --> 00:53:38.010 align:middle line:84%
We showed up with these
extraordinarily sophisticated

00:53:38.010 --> 00:53:40.890 align:middle line:84%
capacities and capabilities
already intact light years

00:53:40.890 --> 00:53:43.680 align:middle line:84%
before we ever even had
the need to use them.

00:53:43.680 --> 00:53:45.888 align:middle line:84%
And they haven't
changed since then.

00:53:45.888 --> 00:53:47.430 align:middle line:84%
So here's anatomically
modern humans.

00:53:47.430 --> 00:53:51.600 align:middle line:10%
You look at their skeletons,
and here's what they look like.

00:53:51.600 --> 00:53:53.250 align:middle line:10%
Not much different
than what you see.

00:53:53.250 --> 00:53:55.395 align:middle line:10%
Modern humans today
look very, very similar.

00:53:55.395 --> 00:53:58.140 align:middle line:10%


00:53:58.140 --> 00:54:00.420 align:middle line:10%
I just wanted a
familiar example.

00:54:00.420 --> 00:54:02.360 align:middle line:10%
I'm sorry.

00:54:02.360 --> 00:54:05.315 align:middle line:90%
I told you I was a musician.

00:54:05.315 --> 00:54:06.690 align:middle line:84%
I'm either going
to shave it off,

00:54:06.690 --> 00:54:08.065 align:middle line:84%
or I'm going to
grow it all back.

00:54:08.065 --> 00:54:09.952 align:middle line:90%
I'm not sure.

00:54:09.952 --> 00:54:11.910 align:middle line:10%
Hey, I'm just happy it's
still there, honestly.

00:54:11.910 --> 00:54:13.455 align:middle line:10%
I'm just really happy.

00:54:13.455 --> 00:54:15.330 align:middle line:10%
They told me if I can
keep it to my 70's, I'm

00:54:15.330 --> 00:54:16.280 align:middle line:10%
probably home free.

00:54:16.280 --> 00:54:18.130 align:middle line:10%
So all right.

00:54:18.130 --> 00:54:18.930 align:middle line:10%
So here it is.

00:54:18.930 --> 00:54:23.220 align:middle line:10%
We showed up 200,000 years ago
with all of the capabilities,

00:54:23.220 --> 00:54:25.290 align:middle line:10%
all the capacities
we have today.

00:54:25.290 --> 00:54:27.120 align:middle line:10%
They haven't changed.

00:54:27.120 --> 00:54:29.170 align:middle line:10%
We don't know
where we came from.

00:54:29.170 --> 00:54:33.510 align:middle line:10%
But what we now can do is
reverse engineer the DNA.

00:54:33.510 --> 00:54:35.220 align:middle line:10%
We take the DNA
that we have that

00:54:35.220 --> 00:54:39.210 align:middle line:10%
gives us all these extraordinary
capabilities-- work backwards.

00:54:39.210 --> 00:54:42.090 align:middle line:84%
What happened to give
us these abilities?

00:54:42.090 --> 00:54:44.700 align:middle line:84%
And this is where the
mindblower comes in.

00:54:44.700 --> 00:54:46.290 align:middle line:84%
Discovery number
three, look at this.

00:54:46.290 --> 00:54:49.470 align:middle line:10%
Human chromosome number 2,
a mysterious chromosome,

00:54:49.470 --> 00:54:51.750 align:middle line:10%
human chromosome
number 2, it's about 8%

00:54:51.750 --> 00:54:56.130 align:middle line:10%
of every cell in your body,
it is responsible for most

00:54:56.130 --> 00:54:58.530 align:middle line:10%
of the neocortex that gives
you your uniqueness where

00:54:58.530 --> 00:55:01.440 align:middle line:10%
those mirror neurons are
and a lot of other very

00:55:01.440 --> 00:55:02.400 align:middle line:10%
special neurons.

00:55:02.400 --> 00:55:03.000 align:middle line:10%
I'm just going to say--

00:55:03.000 --> 00:55:04.875 align:middle line:10%
I can't do it here, but
I just want you know,

00:55:04.875 --> 00:55:11.130 align:middle line:10%
as recently as last year, 2019,
an entire new class of neurons

00:55:11.130 --> 00:55:13.410 align:middle line:10%
was discovered that
only exists in humans

00:55:13.410 --> 00:55:15.460 align:middle line:10%
and was in the neocortex.

00:55:15.460 --> 00:55:18.340 align:middle line:10%
So would you agree with me the
neocortex is pretty important?

00:55:18.340 --> 00:55:19.140 align:middle line:10%
Listen to this.

00:55:19.140 --> 00:55:22.170 align:middle line:10%
It gives us our ability
for emotion, for sympathy,

00:55:22.170 --> 00:55:25.602 align:middle line:10%
for empathy, for compassion,
for self-regulation.

00:55:25.602 --> 00:55:27.810 align:middle line:84%
If you didn't have a neocortex,
you couldn't do that.

00:55:27.810 --> 00:55:31.200 align:middle line:84%
It gives us the capacity,
our unique capacity

00:55:31.200 --> 00:55:32.743 align:middle line:90%
for our humanness.

00:55:32.743 --> 00:55:35.160 align:middle line:84%
So the question is we all just
said it's pretty important.

00:55:35.160 --> 00:55:36.270 align:middle line:90%
Where did it come from?

00:55:36.270 --> 00:55:38.400 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to answer that
question right here.

00:55:38.400 --> 00:55:39.990 align:middle line:10%
It looks very
technical, and I know

00:55:39.990 --> 00:55:41.657 align:middle line:10%
you don't want to
read this whole thing.

00:55:41.657 --> 00:55:45.730 align:middle line:10%
So I'm going to cut to the
last sentence of the last--

00:55:45.730 --> 00:55:48.420 align:middle line:10%
of the end of the
abstract that tells us.

00:55:48.420 --> 00:55:51.240 align:middle line:84%
This is from "Proceedings
National Academy of Sciences."

00:55:51.240 --> 00:55:53.580 align:middle line:90%
The volume is called "Genetics."

00:55:53.580 --> 00:55:56.760 align:middle line:84%
Where did this very, very
special chromosome come from?

00:55:56.760 --> 00:55:57.707 align:middle line:90%
Look at this.

00:55:57.707 --> 00:55:59.040 align:middle line:90%
Well, I've got to tell you this.

00:55:59.040 --> 00:56:00.210 align:middle line:90%
This is so funny.

00:56:00.210 --> 00:56:02.940 align:middle line:84%
Scientists, I work with
scientists all the time.

00:56:02.940 --> 00:56:04.860 align:middle line:84%
When a scientist
makes a discovery

00:56:04.860 --> 00:56:06.925 align:middle line:84%
that they are really
proud of and they're

00:56:06.925 --> 00:56:09.300 align:middle line:84%
going to announce it, and they
want the credit, they say,

00:56:09.300 --> 00:56:10.320 align:middle line:90%
look what I found.

00:56:10.320 --> 00:56:12.500 align:middle line:90%
Look what I found.

00:56:12.500 --> 00:56:14.730 align:middle line:10%
When they make a discovery
that's a little iffy,

00:56:14.730 --> 00:56:17.160 align:middle line:10%
or they might lose
their tenure, or they

00:56:17.160 --> 00:56:19.020 align:middle line:10%
might lose their
funding, they kind of

00:56:19.020 --> 00:56:23.650 align:middle line:10%
hide with some other scientists
and say, look what we found.

00:56:23.650 --> 00:56:24.450 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:56:24.450 --> 00:56:28.170 align:middle line:84%
With that in mind, where does
chromosome number 2 come from?

00:56:28.170 --> 00:56:30.210 align:middle line:84%
"Proceedings for National
Academy of Sciences"

00:56:30.210 --> 00:56:32.950 align:middle line:84%
is trying to tell us, but they
don't want to get in trouble.

00:56:32.950 --> 00:56:38.370 align:middle line:10%
So look at this, "We conclude
that human chromosome 2

00:56:38.370 --> 00:56:43.410 align:middle line:10%
is a relic of an ancient
DNA fusion of two

00:56:43.410 --> 00:56:44.770 align:middle line:10%
ancestral chromosomes."

00:56:44.770 --> 00:56:48.270 align:middle line:84%
Now, there's a whole lot
in that sentence to unpack.

00:56:48.270 --> 00:56:51.610 align:middle line:84%
Now, what they're saying is
there was a fusion of DNA.

00:56:51.610 --> 00:56:52.410 align:middle line:90%
And here it is.

00:56:52.410 --> 00:56:54.060 align:middle line:90%
I wanted you to actually see it.

00:56:54.060 --> 00:56:56.190 align:middle line:84%
Look at that little
pinch point right there.

00:56:56.190 --> 00:56:58.440 align:middle line:84%
That is where the two
chromosomes are fused together.

00:56:58.440 --> 00:56:59.808 align:middle line:90%
Can you all see that?

00:56:59.808 --> 00:57:01.350 align:middle line:84%
Right there, you
can see where it is.

00:57:01.350 --> 00:57:03.060 align:middle line:84%
Now, if there are
biologists in the room,

00:57:03.060 --> 00:57:04.268 align:middle line:90%
you say, what's the big deal?

00:57:04.268 --> 00:57:05.640 align:middle line:90%
Chromosomes fuse all the time.

00:57:05.640 --> 00:57:06.880 align:middle line:90%
You're absolutely right.

00:57:06.880 --> 00:57:08.520 align:middle line:90%
Not this way.

00:57:08.520 --> 00:57:10.180 align:middle line:84%
And that's what I
want you to see.

00:57:10.180 --> 00:57:10.980 align:middle line:90%
All right.

00:57:10.980 --> 00:57:13.332 align:middle line:10%
So you all, the very
aware audience in here,

00:57:13.332 --> 00:57:15.540 align:middle line:10%
you all know about something
called telomeres, right?

00:57:15.540 --> 00:57:18.240 align:middle line:84%
Everybody knows
telomeres-- protective caps

00:57:18.240 --> 00:57:19.410 align:middle line:90%
on the end of the DNA.

00:57:19.410 --> 00:57:22.350 align:middle line:84%
Only on the end of the
DNA is where it's found.

00:57:22.350 --> 00:57:23.910 align:middle line:90%
Check this out.

00:57:23.910 --> 00:57:29.100 align:middle line:84%
Here is typically how
chromosomes will fuse together.

00:57:29.100 --> 00:57:34.020 align:middle line:10%
There is a break in the
chromosomes right there.

00:57:34.020 --> 00:57:36.420 align:middle line:84%
Part of this is
absorbed in the body.

00:57:36.420 --> 00:57:38.550 align:middle line:84%
And there's a
fusion right there.

00:57:38.550 --> 00:57:43.725 align:middle line:84%
That fusion, the fusion
happens right there.

00:57:43.725 --> 00:57:46.050 align:middle line:84%
There are telomeres at the
ends, and there are still

00:57:46.050 --> 00:57:47.190 align:middle line:90%
telomeres at the end.

00:57:47.190 --> 00:57:47.990 align:middle line:10%
OK?

00:57:47.990 --> 00:57:49.290 align:middle line:10%
It's fused at the break point.

00:57:49.290 --> 00:57:50.873 align:middle line:10%
Look at what happened
with you and me.

00:57:50.873 --> 00:57:52.620 align:middle line:10%
With you and me, there are two--

00:57:52.620 --> 00:57:54.210 align:middle line:10%
these are two
chromosomes right here.

00:57:54.210 --> 00:57:56.160 align:middle line:10%
The blue is the telomeres.

00:57:56.160 --> 00:57:56.993 align:middle line:10%
They fused together.

00:57:56.993 --> 00:57:59.077 align:middle line:10%
Remember, they're only
supposed to be on the ends.

00:57:59.077 --> 00:58:00.150 align:middle line:10%
They fused together.

00:58:00.150 --> 00:58:00.950 align:middle line:10%
And look.

00:58:00.950 --> 00:58:02.510 align:middle line:10%
Where are the telomeres now?

00:58:02.510 --> 00:58:03.510 align:middle line:10%
They're not on the ends.

00:58:03.510 --> 00:58:04.310 align:middle line:10%
Look at that.

00:58:04.310 --> 00:58:05.860 align:middle line:10%
They're right there
in the middle.

00:58:05.860 --> 00:58:07.920 align:middle line:10%
This is how we know
they fused together.

00:58:07.920 --> 00:58:09.330 align:middle line:10%
So what did I just say?

00:58:09.330 --> 00:58:10.260 align:middle line:10%
Here it is.

00:58:10.260 --> 00:58:12.660 align:middle line:10%
Typically the chromosomes
will fuse at the break.

00:58:12.660 --> 00:58:14.760 align:middle line:10%
Ours are fused at the end.

00:58:14.760 --> 00:58:16.450 align:middle line:10%
The telomeres are
typically at the ends.

00:58:16.450 --> 00:58:18.020 align:middle line:10%
Ours are right in the middle.

00:58:18.020 --> 00:58:21.620 align:middle line:10%
That is not the product
of natural processes

00:58:21.620 --> 00:58:23.035 align:middle line:10%
as we know them today.

00:58:23.035 --> 00:58:25.213 align:middle line:10%
You don't see that
anywhere else.

00:58:25.213 --> 00:58:27.380 align:middle line:84%
Or if that was too technical,
I made a little movie.

00:58:27.380 --> 00:58:28.580 align:middle line:90%
There it is right there.

00:58:28.580 --> 00:58:30.650 align:middle line:90%
Some of the DNA goes away.

00:58:30.650 --> 00:58:34.760 align:middle line:84%
Some of it is added and modified
to stabilize what happened.

00:58:34.760 --> 00:58:38.570 align:middle line:84%
And this is how you
and I have attained

00:58:38.570 --> 00:58:41.720 align:middle line:84%
this extraordinary capacity
that we have right now.

00:58:41.720 --> 00:58:45.680 align:middle line:84%
Scientists say that the timing,
the precision, and the result

00:58:45.680 --> 00:58:47.750 align:middle line:84%
suggest something
way beyond evolution.

00:58:47.750 --> 00:58:50.000 align:middle line:84%
They say evolution
cannot do this.

00:58:50.000 --> 00:58:51.860 align:middle line:84%
They now say we're in
forbidden territory.

00:58:51.860 --> 00:58:55.460 align:middle line:84%
I love that term, "forbidden
territory," because they

00:58:55.460 --> 00:58:57.620 align:middle line:84%
say for that to
happen, it appears

00:58:57.620 --> 00:59:01.100 align:middle line:84%
that there is an
intention underlying this.

00:59:01.100 --> 00:59:04.520 align:middle line:84%
And the intention
suggests a purpose.

00:59:04.520 --> 00:59:06.770 align:middle line:84%
It implies that
there is a purpose.

00:59:06.770 --> 00:59:08.660 align:middle line:90%
So what do we did we just say?

00:59:08.660 --> 00:59:12.050 align:middle line:84%
The odds, you say, maybe it's
rare, but could it happen?

00:59:12.050 --> 00:59:16.070 align:middle line:84%
Science tells us that
1 in 10 to the 400,

00:59:16.070 --> 00:59:18.340 align:middle line:84%
if those are the odds
of something happening,

00:59:18.340 --> 00:59:21.140 align:middle line:84%
it's considered
impossible, in general.

00:59:21.140 --> 00:59:22.970 align:middle line:10%
DNA, what happened?

00:59:22.970 --> 00:59:23.900 align:middle line:10%
Look at this.

00:59:23.900 --> 00:59:26.520 align:middle line:10%
What the scientists say is 1--

00:59:26.520 --> 00:59:28.340 align:middle line:10%
I want to show you
what that looks like.

00:59:28.340 --> 00:59:32.840 align:middle line:84%
If you want to see what 1 in
10-- if the odds are 1 in 10

00:59:32.840 --> 00:59:36.170 align:middle line:84%
to the 600th, it's
more than impossible.

00:59:36.170 --> 00:59:38.570 align:middle line:84%
1 in 10 to the
400th is impossible.

00:59:38.570 --> 00:59:40.698 align:middle line:90%
It's 1 in 10 to the 600th.

00:59:40.698 --> 00:59:41.990 align:middle line:90%
That's what they're telling us.

00:59:41.990 --> 00:59:43.698 align:middle line:84%
Or if that's too
technical, look at this.

00:59:43.698 --> 00:59:46.070 align:middle line:84%
Sir Fred Hoyle,
British astrophysicist.

00:59:46.070 --> 00:59:47.220 align:middle line:90%
I love this.

00:59:47.220 --> 00:59:49.000 align:middle line:10%
He says the odds
of the DNA forming

00:59:49.000 --> 00:59:52.370 align:middle line:10%
in the way they did are
the equivalent of a tornado

00:59:52.370 --> 01:00:00.510 align:middle line:10%
sweeping through a junkyard
and leaving behind a Boeing 747

01:00:00.510 --> 01:00:03.570 align:middle line:10%
from the scattered
debris, one of these.

01:00:03.570 --> 01:00:05.610 align:middle line:84%
Now, think what are the
odds a tornado is going

01:00:05.610 --> 01:00:08.430 align:middle line:84%
to sweep through a
junkyard and even leave

01:00:08.430 --> 01:00:10.680 align:middle line:90%
a wing, one wing, or a tail.

01:00:10.680 --> 01:00:12.660 align:middle line:90%
It's not going to happen.

01:00:12.660 --> 01:00:15.930 align:middle line:84%
You and I are not the
product of random mutations.

01:00:15.930 --> 01:00:18.480 align:middle line:84%
And the science
is telling us that

01:00:18.480 --> 01:00:19.800 align:middle line:90%
in very, very uncertain terms.

01:00:19.800 --> 01:00:21.960 align:middle line:84%
So the question is, who
or what is responsible?

01:00:21.960 --> 01:00:24.300 align:middle line:84%
There's a whole workshop
we could do with that.

01:00:24.300 --> 01:00:28.140 align:middle line:84%
But what I'll tell you is
it depends on who you ask.

01:00:28.140 --> 01:00:30.120 align:middle line:84%
Ancient traditions,
the ancient Sumerians,

01:00:30.120 --> 01:00:31.170 align:middle line:90%
they have their story.

01:00:31.170 --> 01:00:33.400 align:middle line:84%
The ancient Aboriginals,
look at the creation story.

01:00:33.400 --> 01:00:35.880 align:middle line:90%
They tell us their story.

01:00:35.880 --> 01:00:38.970 align:middle line:84%
The Navajo here in the US,
they tell us their story.

01:00:38.970 --> 01:00:41.370 align:middle line:84%
The Hindus, they have a
beautiful story of cycles,

01:00:41.370 --> 01:00:42.480 align:middle line:90%
great cycles of time.

01:00:42.480 --> 01:00:46.230 align:middle line:84%
The Egyptians have their
story about how we got here.

01:00:46.230 --> 01:00:48.390 align:middle line:84%
Christians have a great
story with pictures.

01:00:48.390 --> 01:00:50.980 align:middle line:84%
I like the Christian
pictures right there.

01:00:50.980 --> 01:00:53.160 align:middle line:90%
Awesome pictures.

01:00:53.160 --> 01:00:56.460 align:middle line:84%
New artifacts being
found in Mesoamerica

01:00:56.460 --> 01:00:58.230 align:middle line:90%
are telling us their story.

01:00:58.230 --> 01:01:00.960 align:middle line:84%
You can see what's
happening there.

01:01:00.960 --> 01:01:02.940 align:middle line:84%
Obviously some
celestial relationship.

01:01:02.940 --> 01:01:05.770 align:middle line:84%
If you watch TV, "Ancient
Aliens" tells us their story.

01:01:05.770 --> 01:01:06.570 align:middle line:90%
All right.

01:01:06.570 --> 01:01:08.830 align:middle line:84%
Scientists have
told us their story.

01:01:08.830 --> 01:01:10.080 align:middle line:90%
But even the scientists doubt.

01:01:10.080 --> 01:01:13.680 align:middle line:84%
Look at the big gap
between modern humans

01:01:13.680 --> 01:01:15.180 align:middle line:90%
and those that came before us.

01:01:15.180 --> 01:01:18.240 align:middle line:84%
They say something happened,
something's missing in there.

01:01:18.240 --> 01:01:20.350 align:middle line:84%
Science is telling
us their story.

01:01:20.350 --> 01:01:22.890 align:middle line:84%
Now it's a new
story based on DNA.

01:01:22.890 --> 01:01:25.800 align:middle line:84%
So the bottom line to all
those ancient stories,

01:01:25.800 --> 01:01:27.900 align:middle line:84%
I have to say, as a
scientist, and this

01:01:27.900 --> 01:01:30.840 align:middle line:84%
is as far as I'm going to go
with this in this program,

01:01:30.840 --> 01:01:34.410 align:middle line:84%
is we have to say there's been
some kind of intervention.

01:01:34.410 --> 01:01:37.350 align:middle line:84%
Some intervention has given
us these extraordinary

01:01:37.350 --> 01:01:39.940 align:middle line:84%
capabilities that
we have right now.

01:01:39.940 --> 01:01:41.070 align:middle line:90%
So are you OK with that?

01:01:41.070 --> 01:01:42.210 align:middle line:90%
Makes sense?

01:01:42.210 --> 01:01:46.860 align:middle line:84%
So the question now is how do
we awaken what we've been given?

01:01:46.860 --> 01:01:48.840 align:middle line:84%
How do we awaken our
extraordinary potential?

01:01:48.840 --> 01:01:51.660 align:middle line:84%
And that's what I want to
do, discovery number four.

01:01:51.660 --> 01:01:55.680 align:middle line:10%
1991, scientists found
40,000 specialized cells

01:01:55.680 --> 01:01:58.650 align:middle line:10%
in the human heart that
had always been there

01:01:58.650 --> 01:02:00.270 align:middle line:10%
and had never been recognized.

01:02:00.270 --> 01:02:02.220 align:middle line:10%
They're called sensory neurites.

01:02:02.220 --> 01:02:05.940 align:middle line:10%
They're like brain cells,
except they're not in the brain.

01:02:05.940 --> 01:02:07.200 align:middle line:10%
They're in the heart .

01:02:07.200 --> 01:02:09.320 align:middle line:10%
They think, they
feel, they learn,

01:02:09.320 --> 01:02:13.090 align:middle line:10%
and they remember independently
of the brain in your head.

01:02:13.090 --> 01:02:15.090 align:middle line:10%
And that means every
experience you've ever had,

01:02:15.090 --> 01:02:18.030 align:middle line:10%
all of your hurt, and all of
your joy, all of your trauma,

01:02:18.030 --> 01:02:21.960 align:middle line:10%
and all of your ecstasy,
you've had in two places.

01:02:21.960 --> 01:02:25.110 align:middle line:10%
Probably not a problem unless
you're trying to heal a trauma.

01:02:25.110 --> 01:02:27.210 align:middle line:10%
And if you're only healing
it through the memories

01:02:27.210 --> 01:02:30.810 align:middle line:10%
in the mind, it may feel that
your healing is incomplete.

01:02:30.810 --> 01:02:32.910 align:middle line:84%
And this gives you a
clue as to why that is.

01:02:32.910 --> 01:02:34.890 align:middle line:90%
Discovery number five.

01:02:34.890 --> 01:02:38.640 align:middle line:84%
We were all told the brain is
the master organ in the body.

01:02:38.640 --> 01:02:42.660 align:middle line:84%
Well, it's not quite accurate,
because the brain and the heart

01:02:42.660 --> 01:02:45.470 align:middle line:84%
actually work
together in harmony.

01:02:45.470 --> 01:02:51.110 align:middle line:84%
Two separate organs working
in one powerful system.

01:02:51.110 --> 01:02:53.970 align:middle line:84%
Two organs, one system,
heart/brain harmony.

01:02:53.970 --> 01:02:55.710 align:middle line:84%
And you are the
only form of life

01:02:55.710 --> 01:02:59.040 align:middle line:84%
that can initiate this
harmony on demand.

01:02:59.040 --> 01:03:02.400 align:middle line:84%
The optimum frequency between
the heart and the brain if you

01:03:02.400 --> 01:03:05.400 align:middle line:90%
want that harmony is 0.1 hertz.

01:03:05.400 --> 01:03:10.060 align:middle line:84%
If you can create a
feeling in your heart

01:03:10.060 --> 01:03:11.860 align:middle line:84%
that sends point 0.1
hertz to your brain,

01:03:11.860 --> 01:03:14.455 align:middle line:84%
you're harmonizing the heart
and the brain together.

01:03:14.455 --> 01:03:16.705 align:middle line:84%
Now, as a geologist-- did I
mention I was a geologist?

01:03:16.705 --> 01:03:17.878 align:middle line:90%
Did I tell you guys that?

01:03:17.878 --> 01:03:19.420 align:middle line:84%
I never get to say
it anymore, so I'm

01:03:19.420 --> 01:03:21.430 align:middle line:90%
going to really enjoy it.

01:03:21.430 --> 01:03:24.260 align:middle line:84%
As a geologist, I'm going to
say hi to this side of the room.

01:03:24.260 --> 01:03:25.510 align:middle line:90%
Hi.

01:03:25.510 --> 01:03:29.170 align:middle line:84%
As a geologist, as a geologist,
this is fashioning point.

01:03:29.170 --> 01:03:30.790 align:middle line:90%
0.1 hertz, look at this.

01:03:30.790 --> 01:03:33.880 align:middle line:84%
These are the magnetic field
frequencies, field line

01:03:33.880 --> 01:03:35.080 align:middle line:90%
resonances of the Earth.

01:03:35.080 --> 01:03:36.497 align:middle line:84%
And I don't want
to get technical,

01:03:36.497 --> 01:03:37.810 align:middle line:90%
but I want you to see this.

01:03:37.810 --> 01:03:40.660 align:middle line:84%
The first spike right here,
guess what the frequency

01:03:40.660 --> 01:03:42.650 align:middle line:90%
is of that first spike.

01:03:42.650 --> 01:03:44.080 align:middle line:90%
But I have to give you a clue.

01:03:44.080 --> 01:03:47.560 align:middle line:90%
It's not 0, and it's not 0.2.

01:03:47.560 --> 01:03:49.990 align:middle line:90%
It's right in between.

01:03:49.990 --> 01:03:52.150 align:middle line:90%
0.1 hertz.

01:03:52.150 --> 01:03:54.610 align:middle line:84%
That 0.1 hertz,
when you harmonize

01:03:54.610 --> 01:03:58.530 align:middle line:84%
the heart and the
brain with 0.1 hertz,

01:03:58.530 --> 01:04:01.210 align:middle line:84%
not only are you harmonizing
the systems within your body.

01:04:01.210 --> 01:04:04.560 align:middle line:84%
You're tuning your body to
the fundamental frequency,

01:04:04.560 --> 01:04:07.050 align:middle line:84%
the magnetic resonance,
not the human resonance,

01:04:07.050 --> 01:04:10.428 align:middle line:84%
the magnetic field resonance
of the planet you live on.

01:04:10.428 --> 01:04:11.970 align:middle line:84%
That makes you a
very powerful being.

01:04:11.970 --> 01:04:13.520 align:middle line:84%
That's where your
healing begins.

01:04:13.520 --> 01:04:14.320 align:middle line:90%
You get that?

01:04:14.320 --> 01:04:16.980 align:middle line:84%
It's not like you're
this little entity

01:04:16.980 --> 01:04:19.470 align:middle line:84%
like floating around here
doing your own thing.

01:04:19.470 --> 01:04:22.620 align:middle line:84%
It's like now you are part of
this massive planet that we

01:04:22.620 --> 01:04:23.550 align:middle line:90%
live on.

01:04:23.550 --> 01:04:26.653 align:middle line:84%
And that is fueling you
to an even deeper healing.

01:04:26.653 --> 01:04:28.320 align:middle line:84%
So I want to show you
this really quick.

01:04:28.320 --> 01:04:29.180 align:middle line:90%
This is our planet.

01:04:29.180 --> 01:04:32.290 align:middle line:84%
Isn't that a beautiful little
planet we live on right there?

01:04:32.290 --> 01:04:35.040 align:middle line:84%
And these are magnetic
lines around the planet.

01:04:35.040 --> 01:04:39.570 align:middle line:84%
And this is the Sun coming from
the left, solar energy pushing,

01:04:39.570 --> 01:04:41.820 align:middle line:84%
deforming the magnetic
fields that protect us.

01:04:41.820 --> 01:04:44.670 align:middle line:90%
You all can see that, right?

01:04:44.670 --> 01:04:47.680 align:middle line:10%
Now, this is an
actual NASA image.

01:04:47.680 --> 01:04:48.480 align:middle line:10%
Each-- OK.

01:04:48.480 --> 01:04:49.600 align:middle line:10%
Are you still with me?

01:04:49.600 --> 01:04:52.480 align:middle line:10%
I know it's warm in here,
but are you guys good?

01:04:52.480 --> 01:04:53.280 align:middle line:10%
OK.

01:04:53.280 --> 01:04:58.080 align:middle line:10%
So listen, as a musician, I love
what I'm about to say to you,

01:04:58.080 --> 01:05:00.520 align:middle line:10%
because we're all musicians.

01:05:00.520 --> 01:05:02.320 align:middle line:10%
Music makes the world go round.

01:05:02.320 --> 01:05:03.120 align:middle line:10%
OK.

01:05:03.120 --> 01:05:06.720 align:middle line:10%
Every one of those
magnetic lines--

01:05:06.720 --> 01:05:09.220 align:middle line:10%
or each magnetic field
creates one of those lines,

01:05:09.220 --> 01:05:11.340 align:middle line:10%
let me say it that way.

01:05:11.340 --> 01:05:16.880 align:middle line:10%
When the sun's energy
pushes against those fields,

01:05:16.880 --> 01:05:22.470 align:middle line:10%
it is like the sun is plucking
the strings of an instrument.

01:05:22.470 --> 01:05:26.540 align:middle line:10%
The sun plucks the string
of that magnetic field.

01:05:26.540 --> 01:05:28.060 align:middle line:10%
Now, here I'll put
it into motion.

01:05:28.060 --> 01:05:30.210 align:middle line:10%
Here's what it looks
like when it happens.

01:05:30.210 --> 01:05:31.650 align:middle line:10%
But I want you to hear it.

01:05:31.650 --> 01:05:32.930 align:middle line:10%
Do you want to hear it?

01:05:32.930 --> 01:05:33.780 align:middle line:10%
Just say yes.

01:05:33.780 --> 01:05:34.720 align:middle line:10%
Just say yes.

01:05:34.720 --> 01:05:35.520 align:middle line:10%
OK.

01:05:35.520 --> 01:05:37.200 align:middle line:10%
So I'm only going
to play this briefly

01:05:37.200 --> 01:05:38.890 align:middle line:10%
in the interest of time.

01:05:38.890 --> 01:05:39.690 align:middle line:10%
All right.

01:05:39.690 --> 01:05:41.710 align:middle line:10%
Here it is.

01:05:41.710 --> 01:05:43.470 align:middle line:10%
So I'm going to--

01:05:43.470 --> 01:05:44.270 align:middle line:10%
let's see.

01:05:44.270 --> 01:05:45.810 align:middle line:90%
I'm going to bring this down.

01:05:45.810 --> 01:05:48.060 align:middle line:90%
It's a very intense sound.

01:05:48.060 --> 01:05:49.680 align:middle line:84%
And I want you to
listen to the sounds

01:05:49.680 --> 01:05:51.840 align:middle line:84%
within the sounds is
what I want you to hear.

01:05:51.840 --> 01:05:52.640 align:middle line:90%
OK.

01:05:52.640 --> 01:05:53.440 align:middle line:90%
Here it goes.

01:05:53.440 --> 01:06:26.270 align:middle line:90%


01:06:26.270 --> 01:06:28.200 align:middle line:10%
Isn't that intense?

01:06:28.200 --> 01:06:30.660 align:middle line:84%
So if you're ever out in the
solar system and get lost

01:06:30.660 --> 01:06:35.650 align:middle line:84%
and you want to come
home, follow that sound.

01:06:35.650 --> 01:06:38.400 align:middle line:84%
So when you harmonize
the heart and the brain,

01:06:38.400 --> 01:06:40.410 align:middle line:84%
this is what you're
harmonizing to.

01:06:40.410 --> 01:06:43.440 align:middle line:84%
Now you know what the magnetic
field of the Earth looks like.

01:06:43.440 --> 01:06:47.700 align:middle line:84%
This is the first
computer generated image.

01:06:47.700 --> 01:06:50.190 align:middle line:84%
And y'all have seen these before
on the internet somewhere.

01:06:50.190 --> 01:06:52.148 align:middle line:84%
But they are-- it's not
an artist's conception.

01:06:52.148 --> 01:06:54.240 align:middle line:84%
This is actually what
the magnetic field

01:06:54.240 --> 01:06:56.220 align:middle line:84%
around the human
heart looks like.

01:06:56.220 --> 01:06:59.520 align:middle line:84%
It extends three to five
feet around the body.

01:06:59.520 --> 01:07:01.620 align:middle line:84%
It looks like what's
called a tube torus.

01:07:01.620 --> 01:07:05.860 align:middle line:84%
It's a very universal
geometric pattern that you see.

01:07:05.860 --> 01:07:08.200 align:middle line:10%
And when you look at that
and you look at this,

01:07:08.200 --> 01:07:09.533 align:middle line:10%
you see a similarity.

01:07:09.533 --> 01:07:10.950 align:middle line:10%
Yeah, well, this
is it right here.

01:07:10.950 --> 01:07:12.990 align:middle line:84%
When you harmonize the
heart and the brain,

01:07:12.990 --> 01:07:14.908 align:middle line:84%
you are actually
bringing your body

01:07:14.908 --> 01:07:16.200 align:middle line:90%
into alignment with this field.

01:07:16.200 --> 01:07:17.640 align:middle line:90%
Now, that's a powerful visual.

01:07:17.640 --> 01:07:20.310 align:middle line:84%
That's why I wanted
you to see that.

01:07:20.310 --> 01:07:22.320 align:middle line:84%
Now, one last thing
I want you to see.

01:07:22.320 --> 01:07:24.540 align:middle line:90%
This 0.1 hertz is what does it.

01:07:24.540 --> 01:07:28.050 align:middle line:84%
0.1 hertz, this is where
the healing begins,

01:07:28.050 --> 01:07:29.460 align:middle line:90%
the regeneration.

01:07:29.460 --> 01:07:31.590 align:middle line:84%
Super longevity can
come-- there's so

01:07:31.590 --> 01:07:34.030 align:middle line:84%
many things that can
happen from harmonizing

01:07:34.030 --> 01:07:35.030 align:middle line:90%
the heart and the brain.

01:07:35.030 --> 01:07:37.560 align:middle line:10%
So it's not just a
one-time exercise.

01:07:37.560 --> 01:07:41.130 align:middle line:10%
Once you access
that harmony, you

01:07:41.130 --> 01:07:44.010 align:middle line:10%
have the ability to
access super longevity,

01:07:44.010 --> 01:07:46.110 align:middle line:10%
awakening the longevity
enzymes that already

01:07:46.110 --> 01:07:49.470 align:middle line:10%
live in your body, super
immune response, direct access

01:07:49.470 --> 01:07:52.500 align:middle line:10%
to this deep wisdom,
heart intelligence.

01:07:52.500 --> 01:07:55.723 align:middle line:84%
It's a trigger for over
1,300 biochemical reactions.

01:07:55.723 --> 01:07:57.390 align:middle line:84%
I used to go through
every one of those,

01:07:57.390 --> 01:07:59.700 align:middle line:84%
and I found my audience
didn't like it.

01:07:59.700 --> 01:08:03.060 align:middle line:10%
So I don't I don't go through
all 1,300 chemical reactions

01:08:03.060 --> 01:08:03.930 align:middle line:10%
anymore.

01:08:03.930 --> 01:08:05.550 align:middle line:10%
I would group them
into groups of 10,

01:08:05.550 --> 01:08:07.720 align:middle line:10%
and it was still too much.

01:08:07.720 --> 01:08:08.520 align:middle line:10%
But look at this.

01:08:08.520 --> 01:08:11.940 align:middle line:84%
Resilience, super
intuition, direct access,

01:08:11.940 --> 01:08:13.440 align:middle line:84%
the hotline to
your subconscious,

01:08:13.440 --> 01:08:16.350 align:middle line:84%
super learning, super
memory, super cognition.

01:08:16.350 --> 01:08:18.359 align:middle line:84%
All of this, and much--
oh, I have to say this.

01:08:18.359 --> 01:08:21.180 align:middle line:84%
Mirror neurons,
much, much more, all

01:08:21.180 --> 01:08:25.410 align:middle line:84%
begin with harmonizing
the heart and the brain.

01:08:25.410 --> 01:08:29.580 align:middle line:84%
Now, if you are not into
any of those, simply

01:08:29.580 --> 01:08:31.319 align:middle line:84%
harmonizing the
heart and the brain

01:08:31.319 --> 01:08:33.450 align:middle line:84%
will strengthen
your immune system

01:08:33.450 --> 01:08:36.330 align:middle line:84%
and it will awaken
your longevity enzymes.

01:08:36.330 --> 01:08:38.370 align:middle line:84%
Heart-brain harmony,
it's just the beginning.

01:08:38.370 --> 01:08:40.740 align:middle line:90%
Discovery number six.

01:08:40.740 --> 01:08:42.899 align:middle line:10%
You all know what
these are, right?

01:08:42.899 --> 01:08:45.279 align:middle line:10%
These are neurons inside
a living human brain.

01:08:45.279 --> 01:08:46.770 align:middle line:10%
This is a person
having thoughts.

01:08:46.770 --> 01:08:47.570 align:middle line:10%
But look at this.

01:08:47.570 --> 01:08:52.050 align:middle line:10%
They are random thoughts,
random firings, the neurons,

01:08:52.050 --> 01:08:54.479 align:middle line:10%
what would happen if you
could harmonize all of those

01:08:54.479 --> 01:08:57.330 align:middle line:10%
and bring them together so
they all fire at the same time?

01:08:57.330 --> 01:09:00.569 align:middle line:10%
What if you could
harness that energy

01:09:00.569 --> 01:09:03.580 align:middle line:10%
for your own
healing or to access

01:09:03.580 --> 01:09:06.609 align:middle line:10%
your own deep intuition to
harmonize you with the Earth?

01:09:06.609 --> 01:09:08.767 align:middle line:84%
Well, let me show you
first what it looks like.

01:09:08.767 --> 01:09:09.850 align:middle line:90%
This is a different brain.

01:09:09.850 --> 01:09:11.642 align:middle line:84%
I want to show you the
front of this brain.

01:09:11.642 --> 01:09:13.660 align:middle line:84%
Over 90% of the
front of this brain

01:09:13.660 --> 01:09:15.810 align:middle line:90%
is going to fire simultaneously.

01:09:15.810 --> 01:09:18.310 align:middle line:84%
This is what it looks like when
you harmonize those neurons.

01:09:18.310 --> 01:09:19.300 align:middle line:90%
Not there or there or there.

01:09:19.300 --> 01:09:19.630 align:middle line:90%
Right there.

01:09:19.630 --> 01:09:20.430 align:middle line:90%
Boom.

01:09:20.430 --> 01:09:22.149 align:middle line:90%
Look at that.

01:09:22.149 --> 01:09:23.470 align:middle line:90%
Look at that.

01:09:23.470 --> 01:09:25.120 align:middle line:90%
We do this.

01:09:25.120 --> 01:09:27.550 align:middle line:84%
And we can do it on
demand consciously.

01:09:27.550 --> 01:09:32.370 align:middle line:84%
It is such an advanced
soft technology.

01:09:32.370 --> 01:09:36.460 align:middle line:84%
And it's where we begin
to rewrite our story.

01:09:36.460 --> 01:09:37.792 align:middle line:90%
The world is changing.

01:09:37.792 --> 01:09:39.250 align:middle line:84%
We're not going to
stop the change.

01:09:39.250 --> 01:09:42.430 align:middle line:84%
All we can do is determine
how we respond to that change.

01:09:42.430 --> 01:09:46.750 align:middle line:84%
The old human story says we're
powerless victims in the world,

01:09:46.750 --> 01:09:49.689 align:middle line:90%
and we need someone to save us.

01:09:49.689 --> 01:09:54.180 align:middle line:84%
The new human story says that we
are masters of our own biology.

01:09:54.180 --> 01:09:59.080 align:middle line:84%
And as we shift the way
that we think, our story,

01:09:59.080 --> 01:10:00.977 align:middle line:84%
it shifts the way that
we live our lives,

01:10:00.977 --> 01:10:03.310 align:middle line:84%
the way we solve our problems,
the kind of relationships

01:10:03.310 --> 01:10:04.977 align:middle line:84%
that we attract, how
we heal our bodies,

01:10:04.977 --> 01:10:07.930 align:middle line:84%
and what kind of
a world we build.

01:10:07.930 --> 01:10:11.770 align:middle line:84%
And that is the power of the new
human story, self-regulation.

01:10:11.770 --> 01:10:13.360 align:middle line:90%
And you've been very, very kind.

01:10:13.360 --> 01:10:14.410 align:middle line:90%
And we went quickly.

01:10:14.410 --> 01:10:17.727 align:middle line:90%
Thank you all so much.

01:10:17.727 --> 01:10:19.810 align:middle line:84%
Thank you for the opportunity
to be in here today.

01:10:19.810 --> 01:10:22.480 align:middle line:90%
I love you all.

01:10:22.480 --> 01:10:25.830 align:middle line:90%
