WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.190 align:middle line:90%


00:00:06.190 --> 00:00:08.530 align:middle line:84%
>> Today we have something
very extraordinary.

00:00:08.530 --> 00:00:10.810 align:middle line:84%
I am really thrilled
that we have

00:00:10.810 --> 00:00:12.610 align:middle line:90%
Danny Sheehan with us today.

00:00:12.610 --> 00:00:15.220 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:00:15.220 --> 00:00:20.470 align:middle line:84%
And Danny is like a mentor
and a teacher to so many

00:00:20.470 --> 00:00:22.570 align:middle line:90%
of us, certainly me.

00:00:22.570 --> 00:00:25.600 align:middle line:84%
When he refers to international
or domestic policy,

00:00:25.600 --> 00:00:30.730 align:middle line:84%
constitutional
law, world affairs,

00:00:30.730 --> 00:00:33.820 align:middle line:84%
international relations, but
certainly also the esoteric

00:00:33.820 --> 00:00:37.030 align:middle line:84%
and the mystery
schools, and even UFOs.

00:00:37.030 --> 00:00:41.590 align:middle line:84%
So you kind of get an
all-around variety of wisdom

00:00:41.590 --> 00:00:44.620 align:middle line:84%
here on a multitude
of different levels.

00:00:44.620 --> 00:00:49.120 align:middle line:84%
Of course, he has been involved
in cases like Iran-Contra

00:00:49.120 --> 00:00:50.530 align:middle line:90%
and at the Pentagon Papers.

00:00:50.530 --> 00:00:53.020 align:middle line:84%
And his credentials
speak so much.

00:00:53.020 --> 00:00:55.300 align:middle line:84%
But I'm not going
to waste any time.

00:00:55.300 --> 00:00:57.730 align:middle line:84%
Please, give a very warm
and wonderful welcome

00:00:57.730 --> 00:01:00.300 align:middle line:84%
for our good friend
Mr. Daniel Sheehan.

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:01.750 align:middle line:90%
>> Thanks.

00:01:01.750 --> 00:01:02.620 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:01:02.620 --> 00:01:03.970 align:middle line:90%
Hello.

00:01:03.970 --> 00:01:08.262 align:middle line:84%
Will this echo or I turn
it off, or something?

00:01:08.262 --> 00:01:09.120 align:middle line:90%
Anyway.

00:01:09.120 --> 00:01:09.740 align:middle line:90%
Here we go.

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:10.590 align:middle line:90%
Put that over there.

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:11.390 align:middle line:90%
Great.

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:12.300 align:middle line:90%
Thank you, guys.

00:01:12.300 --> 00:01:13.330 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:01:13.330 --> 00:01:16.200 align:middle line:10%
What I want to talk
about this afternoon

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:23.040 align:middle line:10%
is the fact that other than
this huge brouha going on

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:24.630 align:middle line:10%
and this major
confrontation that's

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:27.150 align:middle line:10%
going on around the country
right now with everybody

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:30.180 align:middle line:10%
sort of retreating to
their respective corners

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:32.790 align:middle line:10%
and getting ready to
have a major food fight,

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:39.870 align:middle line:10%
other than that going on, two
of the major movements going on

00:01:39.870 --> 00:01:42.250 align:middle line:10%
in the world right now.

00:01:42.250 --> 00:01:45.150 align:middle line:10%
One of them of course
is the major movement

00:01:45.150 --> 00:01:51.390 align:middle line:10%
to try to slow and stop, and
reverse global climate change.

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:55.170 align:middle line:84%
This is bearing down
on everyone now.

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:57.840 align:middle line:84%
The scientists have been
trying to tell people

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:01.380 align:middle line:84%
about this for some
two, three decades now.

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:03.720 align:middle line:84%
But now people are
starting to notice it

00:02:03.720 --> 00:02:06.150 align:middle line:84%
with half of northern
California burning

00:02:06.150 --> 00:02:09.130 align:middle line:84%
to the ground and
massive tornadoes,

00:02:09.130 --> 00:02:12.210 align:middle line:84%
coming floods, and wiping
out entire cities like New

00:02:12.210 --> 00:02:14.440 align:middle line:90%
Orleans, et cetera.

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:17.460 align:middle line:84%
So people are now sort
of grokking the fact

00:02:17.460 --> 00:02:22.480 align:middle line:84%
that the consequences of global
climate change are upon us now.

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:24.930 align:middle line:84%
And so there's a
major movement that's

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:27.750 align:middle line:84%
been going on to
try to come to grips

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:31.070 align:middle line:84%
with the kind of the
fundamental causes of this

00:02:31.070 --> 00:02:34.630 align:middle line:84%
and not just address
the symptoms.

00:02:34.630 --> 00:02:37.560 align:middle line:84%
And so there's this whole
movement for a Green New Deal,

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:41.130 align:middle line:84%
a major fundamental
reorientation of our economy

00:02:41.130 --> 00:02:43.350 align:middle line:84%
and our way of
living that is going

00:02:43.350 --> 00:02:46.710 align:middle line:84%
to try to roll back the
consequences of relying

00:02:46.710 --> 00:02:52.340 align:middle line:84%
upon fossil fuels, of gasoline,
and coal, and natural gas, et

00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:56.860 align:middle line:84%
cetera, and others
of the fossil fuels.

00:02:56.860 --> 00:02:59.250 align:middle line:90%
And so that's a major movement.

00:02:59.250 --> 00:03:01.020 align:middle line:84%
But there's also
at the same time

00:03:01.020 --> 00:03:04.080 align:middle line:84%
going on a second
major movement, which

00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:07.860 align:middle line:84%
is this movement for
the establishment

00:03:07.860 --> 00:03:11.580 align:middle line:84%
of a new paradigm,
a new worldview.

00:03:11.580 --> 00:03:14.250 align:middle line:84%
I touched upon it just
briefly this afternoon

00:03:14.250 --> 00:03:18.030 align:middle line:84%
at noontime on the
panel, because they asked

00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:22.590 align:middle line:84%
me to talk about what are kind
of the major messages I would

00:03:22.590 --> 00:03:24.090 align:middle line:90%
have for people.

00:03:24.090 --> 00:03:26.640 align:middle line:84%
And of course, I was addressing
the issue of global climate

00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:28.710 align:middle line:90%
change.

00:03:28.710 --> 00:03:30.990 align:middle line:84%
But I also talked
about this dynamic

00:03:30.990 --> 00:03:33.310 align:middle line:90%
going on of the new paradigm.

00:03:33.310 --> 00:03:38.940 align:middle line:84%
And what this is at
base is an effort

00:03:38.940 --> 00:03:43.560 align:middle line:84%
on the part of the intellectual,
spiritual, philosophical

00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:47.070 align:middle line:84%
community to
attempt to integrate

00:03:47.070 --> 00:03:51.300 align:middle line:84%
into all of the various
fields of human knowledge.

00:03:51.300 --> 00:03:55.680 align:middle line:84%
The insights that have
actually been come to way

00:03:55.680 --> 00:03:58.050 align:middle line:84%
back at the beginning
of the 20th century.

00:03:58.050 --> 00:04:02.250 align:middle line:84%
Back between actually
1923 and 1926,

00:04:02.250 --> 00:04:06.030 align:middle line:84%
there were a whole series of
major scientific discoveries

00:04:06.030 --> 00:04:10.590 align:middle line:84%
that were made by Louis de
Broglie, Max Planck, Neil

00:04:10.590 --> 00:04:14.970 align:middle line:84%
Bour, Erwin Schrodinger,
and Werner Heisenberg,

00:04:14.970 --> 00:04:16.890 align:middle line:84%
and others that
you've heard about,

00:04:16.890 --> 00:04:22.620 align:middle line:84%
that really so
dramatically countered

00:04:22.620 --> 00:04:27.090 align:middle line:84%
the fundamental assumptions of
the materialist worldview that

00:04:27.090 --> 00:04:32.460 align:middle line:84%
had arisen at the end of the
Enlightenment, that this--

00:04:32.460 --> 00:04:34.770 align:middle line:84%
up until the
Enlightenment, it's sort of

00:04:34.770 --> 00:04:38.100 align:middle line:84%
understood to have gone on
some right around the beginning

00:04:38.100 --> 00:04:44.430 align:middle line:84%
of 1700 to 1789, that entire
period of the 18th century,

00:04:44.430 --> 00:04:48.210 align:middle line:84%
during which there was
an effort to dispel

00:04:48.210 --> 00:04:54.180 align:middle line:84%
the kind of superstitious
worldviews that had governed

00:04:54.180 --> 00:04:56.110 align:middle line:90%
during the medieval period.

00:04:56.110 --> 00:05:00.960 align:middle line:84%
It was superstition and dunking
witches to see if they floated

00:05:00.960 --> 00:05:01.760 align:middle line:90%
or didn't.

00:05:01.760 --> 00:05:04.860 align:middle line:84%
This whole thing
that was going on,

00:05:04.860 --> 00:05:07.740 align:middle line:84%
there was an attempt to
kind of get that behind us.

00:05:07.740 --> 00:05:12.480 align:middle line:84%
And with the scientific
discoveries that were going on,

00:05:12.480 --> 00:05:16.980 align:middle line:84%
the Age of Reason came upon
us through the Enlightenment.

00:05:16.980 --> 00:05:22.500 align:middle line:84%
And what happened is there
was a major encyclopedia that

00:05:22.500 --> 00:05:27.810 align:middle line:84%
was actually written at
the end of the period,

00:05:27.810 --> 00:05:30.480 align:middle line:90%
of the Enlightenment period.

00:05:30.480 --> 00:05:35.760 align:middle line:84%
There was-- 28
volumes were written

00:05:35.760 --> 00:05:39.870 align:middle line:84%
that were explaining
this entire new worldview

00:05:39.870 --> 00:05:43.830 align:middle line:84%
of the natural sciences,
that everything was reduced

00:05:43.830 --> 00:05:50.520 align:middle line:84%
to scientific materialism,
and that rational inquiry

00:05:50.520 --> 00:05:54.390 align:middle line:84%
through science, and the
application of linear thought

00:05:54.390 --> 00:06:00.630 align:middle line:84%
and mathematical certainty
could actually determine all

00:06:00.630 --> 00:06:04.690 align:middle line:90%
of the reality in the universe.

00:06:04.690 --> 00:06:07.710 align:middle line:84%
They postulated that
everything in the universe

00:06:07.710 --> 00:06:11.190 align:middle line:84%
was made up of
material matter that

00:06:11.190 --> 00:06:16.810 align:middle line:84%
was either mass or
energy, the two of them,

00:06:16.810 --> 00:06:19.290 align:middle line:84%
and that the entire
universe was made up

00:06:19.290 --> 00:06:23.910 align:middle line:84%
of these little individual
units of matter,

00:06:23.910 --> 00:06:25.720 align:middle line:84%
whether they were
mass or energy.

00:06:25.720 --> 00:06:30.180 align:middle line:84%
But if one could determine
how they sort of bang

00:06:30.180 --> 00:06:32.880 align:middle line:84%
together, like little
billiard balls,

00:06:32.880 --> 00:06:37.110 align:middle line:84%
one could predict how they were
going to bounce off each other.

00:06:37.110 --> 00:06:40.320 align:middle line:84%
And you could determine
from determining the weight

00:06:40.320 --> 00:06:43.650 align:middle line:84%
and the velocity of a
particular unit of matter,

00:06:43.650 --> 00:06:45.510 align:middle line:84%
in its encounter
with another one,

00:06:45.510 --> 00:06:49.830 align:middle line:84%
you could determine if you
knew the angle of impact

00:06:49.830 --> 00:06:51.360 align:middle line:90%
where it was going.

00:06:51.360 --> 00:06:54.960 align:middle line:84%
And so there was this
hallelujah chorus

00:06:54.960 --> 00:06:58.590 align:middle line:84%
went up for the human
family that we had finally

00:06:58.590 --> 00:07:04.080 align:middle line:84%
discovered how to determine
the future in reality.

00:07:04.080 --> 00:07:05.910 align:middle line:84%
And you could get
control over it.

00:07:05.910 --> 00:07:09.810 align:middle line:84%
Very importantly, it
postulated-- so it said, first,

00:07:09.810 --> 00:07:13.230 align:middle line:84%
that the universe was made up
of these little tiny billiard

00:07:13.230 --> 00:07:18.390 align:middle line:84%
balls that we could predict what
was going to happen with them.

00:07:18.390 --> 00:07:21.150 align:middle line:84%
And this enabled us to
not only predict it,

00:07:21.150 --> 00:07:27.060 align:middle line:84%
but to control it by intervening
physically into the material

00:07:27.060 --> 00:07:27.960 align:middle line:90%
universe.

00:07:27.960 --> 00:07:30.930 align:middle line:84%
If we could insert
ourselves into the interplay

00:07:30.930 --> 00:07:34.350 align:middle line:84%
between these little
billiard balls

00:07:34.350 --> 00:07:37.210 align:middle line:84%
that made up all of
the material reality,

00:07:37.210 --> 00:07:42.480 align:middle line:84%
we could actually impact
and control reality itself.

00:07:42.480 --> 00:07:45.720 align:middle line:84%
Not coincidentally,
empowering ourselves

00:07:45.720 --> 00:07:52.650 align:middle line:84%
as a species to basically
gain control over nature

00:07:52.650 --> 00:07:57.900 align:middle line:84%
and the material realm of
reality to our own benefit,

00:07:57.900 --> 00:08:00.480 align:middle line:84%
not coincidentally,
as it turns out.

00:08:00.480 --> 00:08:02.190 align:middle line:84%
That was what the
whole purpose was--

00:08:02.190 --> 00:08:05.940 align:middle line:84%
to get control of nature,
get control of reality,

00:08:05.940 --> 00:08:10.110 align:middle line:84%
and remold it,
repath it, pathway it

00:08:10.110 --> 00:08:15.000 align:middle line:84%
from its logical encounters
with each other at random,

00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:21.080 align:middle line:84%
but to get them in control
for our own material benefit.

00:08:21.080 --> 00:08:27.360 align:middle line:84%
But as I said, this set of
discoveries that took place

00:08:27.360 --> 00:08:31.800 align:middle line:84%
had to cope with the
undertaking at the end

00:08:31.800 --> 00:08:34.490 align:middle line:90%
of the period of Enlightenment.

00:08:34.490 --> 00:08:35.880 align:middle line:90%
There was this period of--

00:08:35.880 --> 00:08:42.960 align:middle line:84%
all of these people Rousseau and
Voltaire, and about 12 people

00:08:42.960 --> 00:08:46.380 align:middle line:84%
all came together, big
philosophers and theologians

00:08:46.380 --> 00:08:50.100 align:middle line:84%
and scientists, and they all
prepared this big 28 volume

00:08:50.100 --> 00:08:53.820 align:middle line:84%
encyclopedia that
basically applied

00:08:53.820 --> 00:08:58.410 align:middle line:84%
this theory of scientific,
logical, positivist

00:08:58.410 --> 00:08:59.730 align:middle line:90%
materialism.

00:08:59.730 --> 00:09:03.210 align:middle line:84%
They applied it to every
field, not just physics,

00:09:03.210 --> 00:09:08.280 align:middle line:84%
but in philosophy, in
religion, in linguistics,

00:09:08.280 --> 00:09:13.020 align:middle line:84%
and in etymology, the
evolution of our species.

00:09:13.020 --> 00:09:16.680 align:middle line:84%
They engaged in
this whole process

00:09:16.680 --> 00:09:20.850 align:middle line:84%
of gaining control of how
people thought in the world

00:09:20.850 --> 00:09:23.360 align:middle line:90%
in Western civilization.

00:09:23.360 --> 00:09:29.100 align:middle line:84%
That had this major effect so
that when the discoveries got

00:09:29.100 --> 00:09:34.570 align:middle line:84%
made between 1923 and
1926 in the beginning

00:09:34.570 --> 00:09:39.180 align:middle line:84%
of the 20th century,
it really, as I said,

00:09:39.180 --> 00:09:42.510 align:middle line:84%
knocked into a
complete cocked hat

00:09:42.510 --> 00:09:46.840 align:middle line:84%
all of these fundamental
assumptions about materialism.

00:09:46.840 --> 00:09:49.710 align:middle line:90%
The world view didn't change.

00:09:49.710 --> 00:09:53.190 align:middle line:84%
The scientific community
stayed locked in

00:09:53.190 --> 00:09:57.900 align:middle line:84%
to this scientific, logical,
positivist, radical materialist

00:09:57.900 --> 00:10:04.710 align:middle line:84%
worldview, because our entire
sense of power and control

00:10:04.710 --> 00:10:09.690 align:middle line:84%
over our environment was
so essential to our species

00:10:09.690 --> 00:10:11.370 align:middle line:90%
that we wouldn't let go of it.

00:10:11.370 --> 00:10:18.600 align:middle line:84%
And so these discoveries that
got made between 1923 and 1926,

00:10:18.600 --> 00:10:20.610 align:middle line:84%
even though the scientific
community started

00:10:20.610 --> 00:10:23.400 align:middle line:84%
making these all
available to everybody,

00:10:23.400 --> 00:10:25.650 align:middle line:90%
there was deep resistance to it.

00:10:25.650 --> 00:10:30.270 align:middle line:84%
And so what were this
handful of discoveries

00:10:30.270 --> 00:10:33.630 align:middle line:84%
that were made
between 1923 and 1926

00:10:33.630 --> 00:10:37.380 align:middle line:84%
that so fundamentally challenged
the fundamental assumptions

00:10:37.380 --> 00:10:39.540 align:middle line:90%
of this worldview view?

00:10:39.540 --> 00:10:40.530 align:middle line:90%
And that was this.

00:10:40.530 --> 00:10:45.660 align:middle line:84%
What they discovered is that
these little billiard balls,

00:10:45.660 --> 00:10:49.200 align:middle line:84%
that they all had presumed
under the materialist worldview

00:10:49.200 --> 00:10:52.530 align:middle line:84%
were these ultimately solid
little units of matter that

00:10:52.530 --> 00:10:54.270 align:middle line:84%
would bang together
and we could predict

00:10:54.270 --> 00:10:55.830 align:middle line:84%
how they were
going to interact--

00:10:55.830 --> 00:10:58.180 align:middle line:84%
what they discovered
is that those could be,

00:10:58.180 --> 00:11:00.780 align:middle line:90%
in fact, broken up.

00:11:00.780 --> 00:11:05.100 align:middle line:84%
You could break up those atoms,
in that they would actually

00:11:05.100 --> 00:11:08.870 align:middle line:84%
break up into protons and
neutrons and electrons.

00:11:08.870 --> 00:11:11.390 align:middle line:84%
And you could actually
break them up further.

00:11:11.390 --> 00:11:13.850 align:middle line:84%
And you could break
up the proton.

00:11:13.850 --> 00:11:17.690 align:middle line:84%
You could break that up
into smaller electrons.

00:11:17.690 --> 00:11:23.000 align:middle line:84%
You could break them up further
into photons, in neutrinos,

00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:28.730 align:middle line:84%
in quarks, in leptons, in muons,
and sleptons, and squarks.

00:11:28.730 --> 00:11:30.260 align:middle line:90%
And they kept on going.

00:11:30.260 --> 00:11:32.327 align:middle line:84%
They kept on being
able to discover

00:11:32.327 --> 00:11:34.660 align:middle line:84%
you could break these things
up into smaller and smaller

00:11:34.660 --> 00:11:38.460 align:middle line:90%
and smaller entities of matter.

00:11:38.460 --> 00:11:41.000 align:middle line:84%
But the most important
thing they discovered

00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:42.980 align:middle line:84%
is that you would
ultimately come to a point

00:11:42.980 --> 00:11:46.070 align:middle line:84%
where when you broke up
the most-- the smallest

00:11:46.070 --> 00:11:51.470 align:middle line:84%
possible unit of matter,
that it would disappear,

00:11:51.470 --> 00:11:56.660 align:middle line:84%
that it would actually become
non-materially manifest.

00:11:56.660 --> 00:11:59.750 align:middle line:84%
And it would-- all that
was there was what they

00:11:59.750 --> 00:12:03.550 align:middle line:90%
call an inchoate quantum field.

00:12:03.550 --> 00:12:06.920 align:middle line:84%
Inchoate meaning that
it's non-manifest.

00:12:06.920 --> 00:12:11.090 align:middle line:84%
It's there in potential,
but it's not there

00:12:11.090 --> 00:12:13.730 align:middle line:84%
in any kind of
material manifestation.

00:12:13.730 --> 00:12:16.580 align:middle line:84%
And what they discovered
is that, however,

00:12:16.580 --> 00:12:20.300 align:middle line:84%
if you observe one of these
inchoate quantum fields,

00:12:20.300 --> 00:12:25.550 align:middle line:84%
that it would flash back
up into material existence.

00:12:25.550 --> 00:12:29.600 align:middle line:84%
And it would materialize
either as a wave of energy

00:12:29.600 --> 00:12:33.350 align:middle line:84%
and then pop back out of
material manifestation,

00:12:33.350 --> 00:12:37.370 align:middle line:84%
and then it would then pop into
material manifestation again,

00:12:37.370 --> 00:12:40.020 align:middle line:84%
either as another--
a wave of energy

00:12:40.020 --> 00:12:45.350 align:middle line:84%
again, or as an incipient
particle of mass.

00:12:45.350 --> 00:12:50.810 align:middle line:84%
So you've got this mass
or energy manifestation

00:12:50.810 --> 00:12:54.410 align:middle line:84%
in the material realm of an
otherwise inchoate quantum

00:12:54.410 --> 00:12:56.270 align:middle line:90%
field.

00:12:56.270 --> 00:12:59.180 align:middle line:84%
So this was a
complete astonishment

00:12:59.180 --> 00:13:01.940 align:middle line:84%
to the materialist world
saying, wait a second.

00:13:01.940 --> 00:13:05.180 align:middle line:84%
You have actually undermined
the most fundamental premise

00:13:05.180 --> 00:13:07.280 align:middle line:84%
of materialism,
that there aren't

00:13:07.280 --> 00:13:10.880 align:middle line:84%
these predictable
little billiard balls

00:13:10.880 --> 00:13:12.860 align:middle line:84%
that we can figure
out how they're

00:13:12.860 --> 00:13:14.600 align:middle line:84%
bumping into each
other, and so we

00:13:14.600 --> 00:13:18.570 align:middle line:84%
can intervene physically and get
control over the environment.

00:13:18.570 --> 00:13:20.370 align:middle line:84%
So what they
discovered, however,

00:13:20.370 --> 00:13:23.510 align:middle line:84%
is that these inchoate
quantum fields, when

00:13:23.510 --> 00:13:26.360 align:middle line:84%
they would flash into
material manifestation,

00:13:26.360 --> 00:13:30.230 align:middle line:84%
either as a wave of energy
or as basically a Higgs

00:13:30.230 --> 00:13:35.145 align:middle line:84%
boson, an incipient particle
of mass, what they--

00:13:35.145 --> 00:13:39.030 align:middle line:84%
they were figuring this out,
and the big problem number two

00:13:39.030 --> 00:13:42.590 align:middle line:84%
that they discovered is
that they didn't materially

00:13:42.590 --> 00:13:46.820 align:middle line:84%
manifest as either a wave of
energy or a particle of mass

00:13:46.820 --> 00:13:49.730 align:middle line:84%
in any type of
predictable pattern.

00:13:49.730 --> 00:13:51.890 align:middle line:84%
There was no
predictability about this.

00:13:51.890 --> 00:13:53.750 align:middle line:84%
Now, this is quite
disquieting for people

00:13:53.750 --> 00:13:57.800 align:middle line:84%
that are trying to get
control over this process.

00:13:57.800 --> 00:14:03.200 align:middle line:10%
And so what they discovered is
that this random manifestation

00:14:03.200 --> 00:14:06.530 align:middle line:10%
into the material realm,
either as a wave of energy

00:14:06.530 --> 00:14:09.440 align:middle line:10%
or a particle of mass,
which they were totally

00:14:09.440 --> 00:14:12.620 align:middle line:10%
unable to predict, what
they discovered, thirdly,

00:14:12.620 --> 00:14:19.280 align:middle line:10%
and most importantly, is that if
in fact a human being directed

00:14:19.280 --> 00:14:25.840 align:middle line:10%
her or his intention to
the inchoate quantum field,

00:14:25.840 --> 00:14:32.740 align:middle line:10%
it would actually manifest
as what was intended, not

00:14:32.740 --> 00:14:34.360 align:middle line:10%
to a completely
predictable level,

00:14:34.360 --> 00:14:37.930 align:middle line:10%
but to a statistically
significant degree, which

00:14:37.930 --> 00:14:41.710 align:middle line:10%
was all that was necessary
to really freak them out,

00:14:41.710 --> 00:14:45.610 align:middle line:10%
because what this did is it
completely contravened one

00:14:45.610 --> 00:14:47.320 align:middle line:10%
of the most
fundamental assumptions

00:14:47.320 --> 00:14:49.420 align:middle line:10%
of the materialist
world view, and that

00:14:49.420 --> 00:14:54.490 align:middle line:10%
was that somehow the material
world existed out there,

00:14:54.490 --> 00:14:58.270 align:middle line:10%
outside of our eyeballs, outside
of our intention, outside

00:14:58.270 --> 00:15:00.040 align:middle line:10%
of our perspective.

00:15:00.040 --> 00:15:04.330 align:middle line:84%
There was this objective
material world and universe

00:15:04.330 --> 00:15:07.450 align:middle line:84%
that existed in
which we could then

00:15:07.450 --> 00:15:11.890 align:middle line:84%
relate to in this
dialectical dynamic of us

00:15:11.890 --> 00:15:15.190 align:middle line:84%
being outside of it and
separate and apart from it.

00:15:15.190 --> 00:15:18.100 align:middle line:90%
And we could then relate to it.

00:15:18.100 --> 00:15:22.810 align:middle line:84%
And our intellect was the
means by which we did this.

00:15:22.810 --> 00:15:27.670 align:middle line:10%
And the Latin root
for the intellect

00:15:27.670 --> 00:15:33.070 align:middle line:10%
is [SPEAKING LATIN],, which
means the ability to distinguish

00:15:33.070 --> 00:15:36.100 align:middle line:10%
the difference between.

00:15:36.100 --> 00:15:38.950 align:middle line:84%
So that our application
of our intellect

00:15:38.950 --> 00:15:40.840 align:middle line:84%
was rooted in the
necessity of being

00:15:40.840 --> 00:15:43.300 align:middle line:84%
able to have these
separate entities

00:15:43.300 --> 00:15:47.530 align:middle line:84%
of little billiard balls that we
could then apply our intellect,

00:15:47.530 --> 00:15:49.960 align:middle line:84%
the ability to distinguish
the difference between them,

00:15:49.960 --> 00:15:52.790 align:middle line:84%
and make these computations
as to how they were going

00:15:52.790 --> 00:15:54.710 align:middle line:90%
to interact with each other.

00:15:54.710 --> 00:15:57.640 align:middle line:84%
So now all of a sudden,
you, first of all,

00:15:57.640 --> 00:15:59.860 align:middle line:84%
drop right off the
cliff of having

00:15:59.860 --> 00:16:04.270 align:middle line:84%
these billiard balls disappear
entirely out of material

00:16:04.270 --> 00:16:05.650 align:middle line:90%
manifestation.

00:16:05.650 --> 00:16:08.590 align:middle line:84%
And then you had even this
more troublesome reality

00:16:08.590 --> 00:16:12.970 align:middle line:84%
that somehow our direct
human intention actually

00:16:12.970 --> 00:16:17.740 align:middle line:84%
had a direct effect upon the
actual form in which matter

00:16:17.740 --> 00:16:21.130 align:middle line:84%
would manifest itself,
either as a wave of energy

00:16:21.130 --> 00:16:23.910 align:middle line:90%
or a particle of mass.

00:16:23.910 --> 00:16:29.860 align:middle line:84%
And so these things actually
scared all the materialists

00:16:29.860 --> 00:16:30.910 align:middle line:90%
to begin with.

00:16:30.910 --> 00:16:32.140 align:middle line:90%
They said, wait a second.

00:16:32.140 --> 00:16:34.360 align:middle line:90%
We're losing control here.

00:16:34.360 --> 00:16:37.870 align:middle line:84%
We're not in control
of what's going on.

00:16:37.870 --> 00:16:39.970 align:middle line:84%
As they continued to
do their experiments,

00:16:39.970 --> 00:16:42.940 align:middle line:84%
what they discovered
is that if you

00:16:42.940 --> 00:16:48.580 align:middle line:84%
had one of either a wave of
energy or a particle of mass,

00:16:48.580 --> 00:16:53.110 align:middle line:84%
if you accelerated
two of these away

00:16:53.110 --> 00:16:57.700 align:middle line:84%
from each other traveling at
virtually the speed of light,

00:16:57.700 --> 00:17:00.610 align:middle line:84%
what they discovered is
that if you applied force

00:17:00.610 --> 00:17:03.130 align:middle line:84%
to one of them as they
were accelerating away

00:17:03.130 --> 00:17:06.829 align:middle line:84%
from each other and you
applied force to one of them,

00:17:06.829 --> 00:17:09.869 align:middle line:90%
the other one would move.

00:17:09.869 --> 00:17:13.230 align:middle line:84%
And even though they were
traveling at the speed of light

00:17:13.230 --> 00:17:15.790 align:middle line:84%
and they were a distance
away from each other,

00:17:15.790 --> 00:17:18.550 align:middle line:84%
it would happen absolutely
instantaneously.

00:17:18.550 --> 00:17:21.359 align:middle line:84%
And so what that meant
was that somehow there

00:17:21.359 --> 00:17:26.490 align:middle line:84%
was having an effect at a
distance that occurred faster

00:17:26.490 --> 00:17:27.990 align:middle line:90%
than the speed of light.

00:17:27.990 --> 00:17:30.960 align:middle line:84%
And they were convinced
that nothing could happen--

00:17:30.960 --> 00:17:33.210 align:middle line:84%
the materialists-- nothing
could happen faster

00:17:33.210 --> 00:17:34.650 align:middle line:90%
than the speed of light.

00:17:34.650 --> 00:17:39.070 align:middle line:84%
And yet here was this direct
evidence that it could.

00:17:39.070 --> 00:17:43.712 align:middle line:84%
And so what they discovered--
they were actually

00:17:43.712 --> 00:17:45.420 align:middle line:84%
able to compute this,
and they discovered

00:17:45.420 --> 00:17:49.560 align:middle line:84%
that every single
integer of matter,

00:17:49.560 --> 00:17:52.410 align:middle line:84%
whether it's energy or
mass, every single integer

00:17:52.410 --> 00:17:57.720 align:middle line:84%
of matter in the entire universe
was attracted to and bonded

00:17:57.720 --> 00:18:02.490 align:middle line:84%
with and entangled
with every other one

00:18:02.490 --> 00:18:04.420 align:middle line:90%
everywhere in the universe.

00:18:04.420 --> 00:18:06.870 align:middle line:84%
The degree of
attraction between them

00:18:06.870 --> 00:18:08.640 align:middle line:84%
was simply inversely
proportional

00:18:08.640 --> 00:18:10.960 align:middle line:84%
to the square of the
distance between them.

00:18:10.960 --> 00:18:13.740 align:middle line:84%
Now, this is a lot of
extraordinarily intellectual

00:18:13.740 --> 00:18:15.810 align:middle line:84%
work that's being
done here to try

00:18:15.810 --> 00:18:19.710 align:middle line:84%
to understand how the
bottom was dropping out

00:18:19.710 --> 00:18:23.460 align:middle line:90%
of the materialist world view.

00:18:23.460 --> 00:18:26.460 align:middle line:84%
However, the adherence to
the material world view,

00:18:26.460 --> 00:18:29.700 align:middle line:84%
even though it was now
scientifically outmoded,

00:18:29.700 --> 00:18:33.600 align:middle line:84%
all of its fundamental
presumptions, they clung

00:18:33.600 --> 00:18:37.020 align:middle line:84%
to the materialist
world view, because

00:18:37.020 --> 00:18:39.570 align:middle line:84%
via this encyclopedia
that had been prepared

00:18:39.570 --> 00:18:42.120 align:middle line:84%
at the end of the
18th century, they

00:18:42.120 --> 00:18:45.420 align:middle line:84%
had thoroughly thought out
all of the implications

00:18:45.420 --> 00:18:48.150 align:middle line:84%
of materialism for all
of the other fields

00:18:48.150 --> 00:18:49.680 align:middle line:90%
of human knowledge--

00:18:49.680 --> 00:18:54.150 align:middle line:84%
philosophy, and theology, and
literature, and everything

00:18:54.150 --> 00:18:55.690 align:middle line:90%
else.

00:18:55.690 --> 00:18:58.690 align:middle line:84%
And so they clung to
this for two reasons.

00:18:58.690 --> 00:19:01.980 align:middle line:84%
One is that you're probably
all familiar with Thomas Kuhn.

00:19:01.980 --> 00:19:05.580 align:middle line:84%
Thomas Kuhn wrote this
famous article in 1962

00:19:05.580 --> 00:19:09.180 align:middle line:84%
called "The Structure of
Scientific Revolutions."

00:19:09.180 --> 00:19:13.650 align:middle line:84%
And he said that with all
the bragging that scientists

00:19:13.650 --> 00:19:16.350 align:middle line:84%
do about how objective
they are and how committed

00:19:16.350 --> 00:19:19.830 align:middle line:84%
they are to staying open-minded
in concluding things

00:19:19.830 --> 00:19:24.390 align:middle line:84%
about science, they discovered
that when scientists take

00:19:24.390 --> 00:19:26.940 align:middle line:84%
a position on something,
even though they profess

00:19:26.940 --> 00:19:28.560 align:middle line:84%
to be doing
experiments and looking

00:19:28.560 --> 00:19:32.100 align:middle line:84%
for hypothetical changes in
that, that they don't change,

00:19:32.100 --> 00:19:35.430 align:middle line:84%
and that the only way to
bring about a major revolution

00:19:35.430 --> 00:19:38.670 align:middle line:84%
in scientific thinking
was not to convince

00:19:38.670 --> 00:19:40.680 align:middle line:84%
the scientists that
they were wrong,

00:19:40.680 --> 00:19:42.180 align:middle line:84%
but you had to wait
for them to die.

00:19:42.180 --> 00:19:46.120 align:middle line:90%


00:19:46.120 --> 00:19:46.920 align:middle line:90%
Really.

00:19:46.920 --> 00:19:51.630 align:middle line:84%
And so scientific revolutions
happen by a whole generation

00:19:51.630 --> 00:19:53.850 align:middle line:90%
of scientists dying.

00:19:53.850 --> 00:19:57.570 align:middle line:84%
And then the new insights
that have come about

00:19:57.570 --> 00:19:59.200 align:middle line:90%
will come to pass.

00:19:59.200 --> 00:20:01.410 align:middle line:84%
So theoretically, what
should have happened

00:20:01.410 --> 00:20:04.650 align:middle line:84%
is when all of the radical
materialist scientists

00:20:04.650 --> 00:20:08.130 align:middle line:84%
started dying off, then
the new quantum insights

00:20:08.130 --> 00:20:13.050 align:middle line:84%
ought to have come into place,
but they weren't, because

00:20:13.050 --> 00:20:18.000 align:middle line:84%
of this work that had been done
and this set of encyclopedias,

00:20:18.000 --> 00:20:19.500 align:middle line:90%
these 28 volumes.

00:20:19.500 --> 00:20:22.140 align:middle line:84%
This is the thing that isn't
really that well known about,

00:20:22.140 --> 00:20:26.600 align:middle line:84%
but it was prepared
between 1751 and 1772.

00:20:26.600 --> 00:20:31.080 align:middle line:84%
It's called the "Encyclopedia
of the Systematic Encyclopedia

00:20:31.080 --> 00:20:38.070 align:middle line:84%
of Science and Art," and
it was edited by Diderot,

00:20:38.070 --> 00:20:39.900 align:middle line:84%
and I said Rousseau
was involved.

00:20:39.900 --> 00:20:41.820 align:middle line:90%
Voltaire was involved.

00:20:41.820 --> 00:20:43.820 align:middle line:90%
Montesquieu was involved.

00:20:43.820 --> 00:20:46.950 align:middle line:84%
And they all wrote in these
various areas of theology

00:20:46.950 --> 00:20:51.180 align:middle line:84%
and economics and science
and philosophy, and so

00:20:51.180 --> 00:20:53.460 align:middle line:84%
even though people
don't think about it,

00:20:53.460 --> 00:20:57.600 align:middle line:84%
about the fact that all of these
other fields of human knowledge

00:20:57.600 --> 00:21:01.500 align:middle line:84%
are really derivative of
the fundamental assumptions

00:21:01.500 --> 00:21:05.520 align:middle line:84%
about the universe, the
actual physical functioning

00:21:05.520 --> 00:21:07.030 align:middle line:90%
of the universe.

00:21:07.030 --> 00:21:11.100 align:middle line:84%
And so no one wanted
to let go of this.

00:21:11.100 --> 00:21:13.750 align:middle line:84%
And the fact is
even to this day,

00:21:13.750 --> 00:21:17.850 align:middle line:84%
no one has compiled an
alternative encyclopedia

00:21:17.850 --> 00:21:20.790 align:middle line:84%
of really trying to
counter the effect

00:21:20.790 --> 00:21:25.735 align:middle line:84%
of this original set of writings
that were done way back--

00:21:25.735 --> 00:21:28.290 align:middle line:90%
it ended in 1772.

00:21:28.290 --> 00:21:31.170 align:middle line:84%
So this is a task
that needs to really

00:21:31.170 --> 00:21:33.720 align:middle line:84%
be undertaken if in
fact there is going

00:21:33.720 --> 00:21:41.250 align:middle line:84%
to be a full-throated effort to
reconceive of reality in light

00:21:41.250 --> 00:21:42.840 align:middle line:90%
of these discoveries.

00:21:42.840 --> 00:21:47.250 align:middle line:84%
Now, all of these
areas I point out

00:21:47.250 --> 00:21:51.310 align:middle line:84%
that were influenced by the
scientific logical positivist

00:21:51.310 --> 00:21:53.940 align:middle line:84%
worldview that need to
be revisited and looked

00:21:53.940 --> 00:21:58.770 align:middle line:84%
at include, as I said, theology
and philosophy and cosmology

00:21:58.770 --> 00:22:00.480 align:middle line:90%
and all of these.

00:22:00.480 --> 00:22:06.540 align:middle line:84%
So you might ask,
am I singling out

00:22:06.540 --> 00:22:09.980 align:middle line:84%
some of these areas of human
knowledge as most important?

00:22:09.980 --> 00:22:13.590 align:middle line:84%
This is the second part of what
I want to talk about tonight.

00:22:13.590 --> 00:22:15.350 align:middle line:90%
And this is that--

00:22:15.350 --> 00:22:16.960 align:middle line:90%
and this all becomes--

00:22:16.960 --> 00:22:18.980 align:middle line:84%
all of this is
going to be relating

00:22:18.980 --> 00:22:23.390 align:middle line:84%
to how this new world view,
this new quantum world view,

00:22:23.390 --> 00:22:28.190 align:middle line:84%
once it's thoroughly fleshed
out and expanded into dealing

00:22:28.190 --> 00:22:30.110 align:middle line:84%
with all the areas
other than simply

00:22:30.110 --> 00:22:34.130 align:middle line:84%
physics, but philosophy
and theology and economics

00:22:34.130 --> 00:22:35.540 align:middle line:90%
and other things.

00:22:35.540 --> 00:22:37.370 align:middle line:84%
The reason that
it's so important

00:22:37.370 --> 00:22:40.790 align:middle line:84%
is because what I
discovered was--

00:22:40.790 --> 00:22:47.345 align:middle line:84%
you probably know I practice law
all the time, and back in 1973,

00:22:47.345 --> 00:22:51.290 align:middle line:84%
'72 and '73, we were doing
the Watergate burglary case,

00:22:51.290 --> 00:22:56.240 align:middle line:84%
that I was in the Boston law
firm of attorney F. Lee Bailey.

00:22:56.240 --> 00:22:58.620 align:middle line:84%
Our office was
representing James McCord,

00:22:58.620 --> 00:23:02.840 align:middle line:84%
who was the former CIA
wiretapping specialist that

00:23:02.840 --> 00:23:05.870 align:middle line:84%
was in the Democratic
National Committee

00:23:05.870 --> 00:23:08.240 align:middle line:84%
with the other
Watergate burglars.

00:23:08.240 --> 00:23:12.020 align:middle line:84%
And he's the one that ended
up writing the letter to Judge

00:23:12.020 --> 00:23:15.350 align:middle line:84%
Sirica, blowing the whistle on
the plumbers unit and Richard

00:23:15.350 --> 00:23:19.490 align:middle line:84%
Nixon that led to his--
the articles of impeachment

00:23:19.490 --> 00:23:22.580 align:middle line:84%
against Richard Nixon
that caused him to resign.

00:23:22.580 --> 00:23:28.130 align:middle line:84%
But I was-- I got brought over
by Bailey to work on that case

00:23:28.130 --> 00:23:31.580 align:middle line:84%
from the Cahill firm on Wall
Street, where I'd come--

00:23:31.580 --> 00:23:34.700 align:middle line:84%
I was the co-founding editor
of the Harvard Civil Rights Law

00:23:34.700 --> 00:23:38.390 align:middle line:84%
Review, and had gone
directly from there to--

00:23:38.390 --> 00:23:41.618 align:middle line:84%
we initiated the case at
the Law Review at Harvard

00:23:41.618 --> 00:23:43.160 align:middle line:84%
to establish the
right of journalists

00:23:43.160 --> 00:23:45.470 align:middle line:84%
to protect their
confidential news sources.

00:23:45.470 --> 00:23:48.530 align:middle line:84%
That's where that came from
was from our work at the law

00:23:48.530 --> 00:23:49.770 align:middle line:90%
review.

00:23:49.770 --> 00:23:51.830 align:middle line:84%
And so I got recruited
by the law firm that

00:23:51.830 --> 00:23:55.100 align:middle line:84%
represented NBC News
down on Wall Street

00:23:55.100 --> 00:23:58.210 align:middle line:84%
to come to their firm to
do that case with them,

00:23:58.210 --> 00:24:00.710 align:middle line:84%
and had then done the Pentagon
Papers case, because "The New

00:24:00.710 --> 00:24:04.850 align:middle line:84%
York Times" brought the Pentagon
Papers to us when their law

00:24:04.850 --> 00:24:08.060 align:middle line:84%
firm, Lord Day & Lord threatened
to turn them into the FBI

00:24:08.060 --> 00:24:09.590 align:middle line:90%
if they didn't give them back.

00:24:09.590 --> 00:24:12.560 align:middle line:84%
So I ended up being the
one that Jim Goodale

00:24:12.560 --> 00:24:14.780 align:middle line:84%
called who was the general
counsel for "The New York

00:24:14.780 --> 00:24:18.140 align:middle line:84%
Times," because I had done the
amicus briefs for "The New York

00:24:18.140 --> 00:24:19.850 align:middle line:84%
Times" on the right
of journalists

00:24:19.850 --> 00:24:21.920 align:middle line:84%
to protect their
confidential news sources.

00:24:21.920 --> 00:24:25.240 align:middle line:84%
We were doing that at the same
time we were representing NBC.

00:24:25.240 --> 00:24:29.810 align:middle line:84%
That was actually the principle
client, this guy, John Pappas,

00:24:29.810 --> 00:24:31.040 align:middle line:90%
one of their reporters.

00:24:31.040 --> 00:24:34.460 align:middle line:84%
So the bottom line is I was
at F. Lee Bailey's office.

00:24:34.460 --> 00:24:41.690 align:middle line:84%
And Bailey during the course
of our working on the Watergate

00:24:41.690 --> 00:24:44.690 align:middle line:84%
burglary case, he
and I had a number

00:24:44.690 --> 00:24:50.540 align:middle line:84%
of fairly intense conversations
about what we ought to be done.

00:24:50.540 --> 00:24:54.770 align:middle line:84%
And I actually-- some of you
have heard this story before--

00:24:54.770 --> 00:24:57.230 align:middle line:84%
and what we were working
on the case and all the way

00:24:57.230 --> 00:24:59.490 align:middle line:90%
up into May of 1973--

00:24:59.490 --> 00:25:03.290 align:middle line:84%
this happened, remember, on
the night of June 17 of 1972.

00:25:03.290 --> 00:25:04.950 align:middle line:84%
And so we were
working on that case

00:25:04.950 --> 00:25:07.340 align:middle line:84%
all the way up into
the spring of 1973.

00:25:07.340 --> 00:25:11.240 align:middle line:84%
And in May of 1973, the
occupation at Wounded Knee

00:25:11.240 --> 00:25:13.700 align:middle line:90%
occurred out in South Dakota.

00:25:13.700 --> 00:25:16.610 align:middle line:84%
And I got called by
a classmate of mine

00:25:16.610 --> 00:25:18.770 align:middle line:84%
and a good friend of mine
from Harvard Law School

00:25:18.770 --> 00:25:20.720 align:middle line:84%
who was the head of
the Rocky Mountain

00:25:20.720 --> 00:25:23.300 align:middle line:90%
region for ACLU national.

00:25:23.300 --> 00:25:26.700 align:middle line:84%
And so he asked me to come out
to help on the Wounded Knee

00:25:26.700 --> 00:25:27.500 align:middle line:90%
case.

00:25:27.500 --> 00:25:29.700 align:middle line:90%
So I went out to do that.

00:25:29.700 --> 00:25:33.560 align:middle line:84%
And when I came back to the
office, to Lee Bailey's office,

00:25:33.560 --> 00:25:34.820 align:middle line:90%
Lee called me.

00:25:34.820 --> 00:25:36.920 align:middle line:84%
He said, Dan, I understand
that you were out

00:25:36.920 --> 00:25:39.380 align:middle line:90%
at the Wounded Knee occupation.

00:25:39.380 --> 00:25:40.370 align:middle line:90%
I said, yes.

00:25:40.370 --> 00:25:41.170 align:middle line:90%
Yes, I was.

00:25:41.170 --> 00:25:42.087 align:middle line:90%
He said, come on over.

00:25:42.087 --> 00:25:44.403 align:middle line:84%
Come on down to my office,
and let's talk about this.

00:25:44.403 --> 00:25:46.070 align:middle line:84%
So I go down to the
office and sit down.

00:25:46.070 --> 00:25:51.800 align:middle line:84%
And he said to me, he said,
which side were you on?

00:25:51.800 --> 00:25:54.880 align:middle line:84%
I said, well, actually, I said,
well, we were working on it

00:25:54.880 --> 00:25:57.710 align:middle line:84%
and trying to get medical
supplies and food and water

00:25:57.710 --> 00:26:01.190 align:middle line:84%
and stuff to the people
inside the occupation that

00:26:01.190 --> 00:26:03.080 align:middle line:84%
had all these
snipers lying around,

00:26:03.080 --> 00:26:06.320 align:middle line:84%
FBI snipers, and DEA
snipers that were trying

00:26:06.320 --> 00:26:08.300 align:middle line:90%
to pick off people who were--

00:26:08.300 --> 00:26:11.430 align:middle line:84%
the native people that were
occupying this little village.

00:26:11.430 --> 00:26:14.870 align:middle line:84%
And he said, you weren't
on the side of the FBI?

00:26:14.870 --> 00:26:16.580 align:middle line:90%
And I said, no, no.

00:26:16.580 --> 00:26:19.130 align:middle line:84%
And he said, well, what the
hell good does that do us?

00:26:19.130 --> 00:26:21.470 align:middle line:84%
He said, if you'd been
on the side of the FBI

00:26:21.470 --> 00:26:23.720 align:middle line:84%
and the Justice
Department, at least

00:26:23.720 --> 00:26:26.178 align:middle line:84%
we would have generated some
goodwill for the office.

00:26:26.178 --> 00:26:28.220 align:middle line:84%
And you could have gone
to the Justice Department

00:26:28.220 --> 00:26:30.725 align:middle line:84%
to intervene to get a
better deal, for example,

00:26:30.725 --> 00:26:33.500 align:middle line:84%
for like Michael Angiulo,
one of the mafia people

00:26:33.500 --> 00:26:35.130 align:middle line:90%
that we represent.

00:26:35.130 --> 00:26:38.480 align:middle line:84%
So I was going,
uh, wait a second.

00:26:38.480 --> 00:26:41.390 align:middle line:84%
Let's have a discussion about
here what I'm doing here

00:26:41.390 --> 00:26:42.515 align:middle line:90%
and what you're doing here.

00:26:42.515 --> 00:26:44.390 align:middle line:84%
So I started having this
discussion with him.

00:26:44.390 --> 00:26:46.430 align:middle line:84%
And he started saying
things like, hey, look,

00:26:46.430 --> 00:26:48.860 align:middle line:84%
it's not up to me to decide
whether the clients are guilty

00:26:48.860 --> 00:26:50.370 align:middle line:90%
or not.

00:26:50.370 --> 00:26:54.240 align:middle line:84%
All I do is do everything I
can do to get them acquitted.

00:26:54.240 --> 00:26:57.230 align:middle line:84%
And it's up to the other
side to get him convicted

00:26:57.230 --> 00:26:58.350 align:middle line:90%
if they want to do that.

00:26:58.350 --> 00:27:03.290 align:middle line:84%
And he was actually avoiding
any responsibility whatsoever

00:27:03.290 --> 00:27:08.280 align:middle line:84%
for dealing with the truth or
justice or anything like that.

00:27:08.280 --> 00:27:11.010 align:middle line:84%
And so I was having this rather
intense conversation with him

00:27:11.010 --> 00:27:14.220 align:middle line:84%
about a different
view that I had.

00:27:14.220 --> 00:27:18.330 align:middle line:84%
And anyway, so I was staying at
his townhouse on Beacon Hill.

00:27:18.330 --> 00:27:19.620 align:middle line:90%
He was newly married.

00:27:19.620 --> 00:27:21.970 align:middle line:84%
And he was living
outside of Boston.

00:27:21.970 --> 00:27:23.937 align:middle line:84%
I was staying at his
townhouse on Beacon Hill.

00:27:23.937 --> 00:27:25.520 align:middle line:84%
And that following
Sunday morning-- it

00:27:25.520 --> 00:27:27.750 align:middle line:84%
was a Friday afternoon we
had that big discussion.

00:27:27.750 --> 00:27:30.120 align:middle line:84%
So Sunday morning, I go to
church at St. Cecilia's.

00:27:30.120 --> 00:27:32.220 align:middle line:84%
I go to church, and I'm
coming back from church.

00:27:32.220 --> 00:27:33.843 align:middle line:90%
And I stop into this bookstore.

00:27:33.843 --> 00:27:35.760 align:middle line:84%
I'm kind of rummaging
around in the bookstore.

00:27:35.760 --> 00:27:37.380 align:middle line:84%
And I find a copy
of this new book

00:27:37.380 --> 00:27:40.230 align:middle line:84%
that's come out called
"The Theory of Justice"

00:27:40.230 --> 00:27:41.250 align:middle line:90%
by John Rawls.

00:27:41.250 --> 00:27:44.460 align:middle line:84%
John Rawls was the chairman of
the department of philosophy

00:27:44.460 --> 00:27:47.110 align:middle line:84%
at Harvard University
at the time.

00:27:47.110 --> 00:27:47.910 align:middle line:90%
So I looked at it.

00:27:47.910 --> 00:27:49.618 align:middle line:84%
And I started looking
through this thing.

00:27:49.618 --> 00:27:53.130 align:middle line:84%
And he was writing
a major treatise,

00:27:53.130 --> 00:27:56.190 align:middle line:90%
his major treatise on justice.

00:27:56.190 --> 00:27:59.040 align:middle line:84%
And he thought that he was
going to try to figure out

00:27:59.040 --> 00:28:01.410 align:middle line:84%
what the essential
aspects of justice

00:28:01.410 --> 00:28:04.290 align:middle line:90%
were in Western civilization.

00:28:04.290 --> 00:28:07.140 align:middle line:84%
And he thought that
in a democracy,

00:28:07.140 --> 00:28:12.420 align:middle line:84%
when a society is confronted
with a public policy problem,

00:28:12.420 --> 00:28:13.230 align:middle line:90%
whether it's--

00:28:13.230 --> 00:28:14.415 align:middle line:84%
whether you're going
to support abortion,

00:28:14.415 --> 00:28:16.170 align:middle line:84%
or whether you're going
to support first strike

00:28:16.170 --> 00:28:18.503 align:middle line:84%
nuclear weapons, whether
you're going to support capital

00:28:18.503 --> 00:28:21.590 align:middle line:84%
punishment, whatever the
public policy issue was,

00:28:21.590 --> 00:28:26.230 align:middle line:84%
that he suspected that
in a democratic society,

00:28:26.230 --> 00:28:29.550 align:middle line:84%
that what would happen
is the government

00:28:29.550 --> 00:28:32.250 align:middle line:84%
would end up choosing
the option to address

00:28:32.250 --> 00:28:34.890 align:middle line:84%
each one of those issues
that generated the greatest

00:28:34.890 --> 00:28:36.870 align:middle line:90%
good for the greatest number.

00:28:36.870 --> 00:28:40.755 align:middle line:84%
The classic utilitarian,
majoritarian mode

00:28:40.755 --> 00:28:42.120 align:middle line:90%
of ethical reasoning.

00:28:42.120 --> 00:28:44.940 align:middle line:84%
But it turns out he discovered
in doing his work that

00:28:44.940 --> 00:28:47.160 align:middle line:84%
wasn't what happened,
that there was

00:28:47.160 --> 00:28:51.010 align:middle line:84%
this other factor that was going
on in Western civilization.

00:28:51.010 --> 00:28:53.010 align:middle line:84%
And he said, there
are people who assert

00:28:53.010 --> 00:28:54.790 align:middle line:90%
that all men are created equal.

00:28:54.790 --> 00:28:56.640 align:middle line:84%
They're endowed by their
creator with certain inalienable

00:28:56.640 --> 00:28:57.270 align:middle line:90%
rights.

00:28:57.270 --> 00:28:59.560 align:middle line:84%
And they start listing all
these rights free speech,

00:28:59.560 --> 00:29:01.480 align:middle line:84%
freedom of religion,
freedom of the press.

00:29:01.480 --> 00:29:04.200 align:middle line:84%
They start elucidating these
other positions-- equal

00:29:04.200 --> 00:29:06.040 align:middle line:90%
treatment despite your race.

00:29:06.040 --> 00:29:07.380 align:middle line:90%
You know, everything.

00:29:07.380 --> 00:29:10.140 align:middle line:84%
And he said that this
group of people in Western

00:29:10.140 --> 00:29:15.760 align:middle line:84%
civilization he referred
to as the intuitionists.

00:29:15.760 --> 00:29:17.170 align:middle line:90%
And so I said, oh, wow.

00:29:17.170 --> 00:29:18.040 align:middle line:90%
I said, look it.

00:29:18.040 --> 00:29:19.840 align:middle line:90%
That must be the story here.

00:29:19.840 --> 00:29:22.320 align:middle line:84%
Here's Lee Bailey, a
strict utilitarian--

00:29:22.320 --> 00:29:23.295 align:middle line:90%
what's in it for us?

00:29:23.295 --> 00:29:25.420 align:middle line:84%
How are you going to do
something that benefits us?

00:29:25.420 --> 00:29:27.160 align:middle line:84%
And here I am with
these-- citing

00:29:27.160 --> 00:29:30.920 align:middle line:84%
these other kind of abstract
philosophical principles.

00:29:30.920 --> 00:29:33.070 align:middle line:84%
And so I said, I better
get the book and read it.

00:29:33.070 --> 00:29:35.680 align:middle line:84%
So I got a copy of it,
brought it home, and read it.

00:29:35.680 --> 00:29:39.790 align:middle line:84%
And then I called over to John
Rawls office at the school.

00:29:39.790 --> 00:29:42.150 align:middle line:84%
I'd gone to Harvard College
and Harvard Law School.

00:29:42.150 --> 00:29:46.340 align:middle line:84%
And so I called him up, and
called the secretary, and said,

00:29:46.340 --> 00:29:48.910 align:middle line:84%
I'd like to have a meeting
with Professor Rawls

00:29:48.910 --> 00:29:50.380 align:middle line:90%
to talk about his new book.

00:29:50.380 --> 00:29:52.630 align:middle line:84%
Basically, she was saying,
yeah, you and a whole bunch

00:29:52.630 --> 00:29:53.550 align:middle line:90%
of other people.

00:29:53.550 --> 00:29:55.372 align:middle line:84%
But I said-- so I
started waving my school

00:29:55.372 --> 00:29:56.830 align:middle line:84%
tie through the
phone going, I went

00:29:56.830 --> 00:29:58.840 align:middle line:90%
to college and the law school.

00:29:58.840 --> 00:30:01.490 align:middle line:84%
I was the founder of the
Law Review, all this stuff.

00:30:01.490 --> 00:30:04.153 align:middle line:84%
And so she finally says, OK,
well, let me talk to him.

00:30:04.153 --> 00:30:06.070 align:middle line:84%
So he says he agrees
Wednesday I can come over

00:30:06.070 --> 00:30:09.220 align:middle line:84%
to see him like at 2 o'clock,
and he'll give me 15 minutes.

00:30:09.220 --> 00:30:10.260 align:middle line:90%
So I go over there.

00:30:10.260 --> 00:30:12.010 align:middle line:84%
I sit down and start
talking with him,

00:30:12.010 --> 00:30:13.990 align:middle line:84%
and talk about the fact that
I'd done the Pentagon Papers

00:30:13.990 --> 00:30:15.060 align:middle line:90%
case for "The New York Times."

00:30:15.060 --> 00:30:16.525 align:middle line:84%
I did the case that established
the right of journalists

00:30:16.525 --> 00:30:18.670 align:middle line:84%
to protect confidential
news sources,

00:30:18.670 --> 00:30:21.033 align:middle line:84%
that I was doing work on
the Watergate burglary case.

00:30:21.033 --> 00:30:22.450 align:middle line:84%
And he's going--
his eyes are kind

00:30:22.450 --> 00:30:23.980 align:middle line:90%
of getting big like saucers.

00:30:23.980 --> 00:30:25.690 align:middle line:90%
And he said, holy mackerel.

00:30:25.690 --> 00:30:27.610 align:middle line:84%
He said, I didn't
think that people

00:30:27.610 --> 00:30:30.610 align:middle line:84%
that were involved in that kind
of practical work in the law

00:30:30.610 --> 00:30:33.520 align:middle line:84%
really cared about these kind
of more abstract concepts

00:30:33.520 --> 00:30:37.420 align:middle line:84%
that have to do with justice
and intuitionists and all that.

00:30:37.420 --> 00:30:40.540 align:middle line:84%
So we went from 15 minutes
to an hour to two hours.

00:30:40.540 --> 00:30:43.810 align:middle line:84%
He kept canceling
other meetings he had.

00:30:43.810 --> 00:30:46.060 align:middle line:84%
So he ended up asking
me to come back

00:30:46.060 --> 00:30:51.220 align:middle line:84%
to Harvard to do a PhD in
comparative social ethics,

00:30:51.220 --> 00:30:53.690 align:middle line:84%
comparing and
contrasting the mode

00:30:53.690 --> 00:30:58.540 align:middle line:84%
of ethical reasoning of
majoritarian utilitarianism

00:30:58.540 --> 00:30:59.620 align:middle line:90%
versus intuitionism.

00:30:59.620 --> 00:31:02.110 align:middle line:90%
And so I kept asking him.

00:31:02.110 --> 00:31:04.090 align:middle line:84%
I said, well,
what's going on with

00:31:04.090 --> 00:31:06.670 align:middle line:90%
these intuitionists anyhow?

00:31:06.670 --> 00:31:09.600 align:middle line:90%
He said, I don't know.

00:31:09.600 --> 00:31:11.280 align:middle line:84%
I don't know what's
going on there.

00:31:11.280 --> 00:31:13.110 align:middle line:84%
I just know they
say these things.

00:31:13.110 --> 00:31:16.580 align:middle line:84%
They kind of-- they've got a
cryptic, philosophical thing.

00:31:16.580 --> 00:31:19.150 align:middle line:84%
It's not clear where
they're coming from.

00:31:19.150 --> 00:31:21.630 align:middle line:84%
And so I said I guess I
better come back to the school

00:31:21.630 --> 00:31:23.530 align:middle line:84%
and see if we can
help figure this out.

00:31:23.530 --> 00:31:24.870 align:middle line:90%
So I come back.

00:31:24.870 --> 00:31:29.460 align:middle line:84%
So I leave Bailey's office, and
I enroll in September of '73

00:31:29.460 --> 00:31:32.550 align:middle line:84%
to go back to Harvard
University to do my master's

00:31:32.550 --> 00:31:34.650 align:middle line:90%
degree, and then PhD.

00:31:34.650 --> 00:31:37.620 align:middle line:84%
And I figured I was going to end
up in the philosophy department

00:31:37.620 --> 00:31:38.820 align:middle line:90%
under John Rawls.

00:31:38.820 --> 00:31:40.440 align:middle line:84%
Well, it turns out
they assigned me

00:31:40.440 --> 00:31:43.410 align:middle line:84%
to have my thesis advisor
for my master's thesis

00:31:43.410 --> 00:31:48.540 align:middle line:84%
be Dr. Ralph Potter, who teaches
comparative social ethics.

00:31:48.540 --> 00:31:51.240 align:middle line:84%
And he's over at the
Harvard Divinity School.

00:31:51.240 --> 00:31:54.000 align:middle line:84%
So I get assigned to
the Divinity School.

00:31:54.000 --> 00:31:56.583 align:middle line:90%
So I said, it's OK with me.

00:31:56.583 --> 00:31:57.500 align:middle line:90%
They used to say that.

00:31:57.500 --> 00:31:58.410 align:middle line:84%
And when I was at
the law school,

00:31:58.410 --> 00:32:00.827 align:middle line:84%
I would ask certain questions
during the law school class.

00:32:00.827 --> 00:32:02.940 align:middle line:84%
And they would say,
Mr. Sheehan, if you're

00:32:02.940 --> 00:32:04.590 align:middle line:84%
going to ask
questions like that,

00:32:04.590 --> 00:32:08.130 align:middle line:84%
why don't you go over
to the Divinity School?

00:32:08.130 --> 00:32:10.140 align:middle line:84%
And so lo and
behold, here I was.

00:32:10.140 --> 00:32:11.880 align:middle line:84%
There I was at the
Divinity School.

00:32:11.880 --> 00:32:15.490 align:middle line:84%
Kind of the indirect
route, but there I was.

00:32:15.490 --> 00:32:16.950 align:middle line:84%
And I discovered
something that is

00:32:16.950 --> 00:32:20.540 align:middle line:84%
extraordinarily important for
us to talk about here today.

00:32:20.540 --> 00:32:21.630 align:middle line:90%
And that is this.

00:32:21.630 --> 00:32:25.350 align:middle line:84%
It's that Dr. Ralph Potter
started explaining to us

00:32:25.350 --> 00:32:27.000 align:middle line:90%
that there had been lots--

00:32:27.000 --> 00:32:30.270 align:middle line:84%
huge studies done at Harvard
University and other places

00:32:30.270 --> 00:32:32.020 align:middle line:90%
around the world.

00:32:32.020 --> 00:32:33.420 align:middle line:84%
And what they came
to discover is

00:32:33.420 --> 00:32:36.990 align:middle line:84%
that whenever our human
family is confronted

00:32:36.990 --> 00:32:43.170 align:middle line:84%
by any major public policy
issue, that what happens

00:32:43.170 --> 00:32:49.250 align:middle line:84%
is our human family
divides into factions,

00:32:49.250 --> 00:32:53.460 align:middle line:84%
and that these factions take a
completely different position

00:32:53.460 --> 00:32:55.950 align:middle line:84%
as to what ought to
be done to respond

00:32:55.950 --> 00:32:59.150 align:middle line:84%
to this particular
public policy issue.

00:32:59.150 --> 00:33:02.430 align:middle line:84%
And Dr. Talcott Parsons, who was
the founder of the Department

00:33:02.430 --> 00:33:06.150 align:middle line:84%
of Sociology at
Harvard University,

00:33:06.150 --> 00:33:10.080 align:middle line:84%
spent years sending his master's
students and PhD students out

00:33:10.080 --> 00:33:12.600 align:middle line:84%
around the world and
interviewing everybody

00:33:12.600 --> 00:33:16.140 align:middle line:84%
and trying to get them to tell
what their position was on some

00:33:16.140 --> 00:33:19.200 align:middle line:84%
of these issues, whether it's
nuclear first strike, abortion,

00:33:19.200 --> 00:33:24.510 align:middle line:84%
capital punishment, racial
justice, affirmative action,

00:33:24.510 --> 00:33:26.250 align:middle line:90%
whatever the issues were.

00:33:26.250 --> 00:33:29.730 align:middle line:84%
And what he discovered
is that the human family,

00:33:29.730 --> 00:33:32.790 align:middle line:84%
we tend to break ourselves
into, he thought,

00:33:32.790 --> 00:33:35.140 align:middle line:90%
five different groupings.

00:33:35.140 --> 00:33:38.190 align:middle line:84%
And they never did find a
white board for me here.

00:33:38.190 --> 00:33:41.280 align:middle line:84%
And I'm completely inept
in all this technology.

00:33:41.280 --> 00:33:44.310 align:middle line:84%
So I'll have to explain it
to you kind of visually.

00:33:44.310 --> 00:33:48.120 align:middle line:84%
What Ralph-- what Talcott
Parsons discovered,

00:33:48.120 --> 00:33:51.000 align:middle line:84%
he discovered that
these groupings

00:33:51.000 --> 00:33:54.290 align:middle line:84%
that we break into
naturally as human beings,

00:33:54.290 --> 00:33:58.010 align:middle line:84%
that there is a position
on the extreme right

00:33:58.010 --> 00:34:01.230 align:middle line:84%
that he called
right systematists.

00:34:01.230 --> 00:34:03.690 align:middle line:84%
They think systematically
in that they come up

00:34:03.690 --> 00:34:07.530 align:middle line:84%
with this position, which he
put at the end of this spectrum,

00:34:07.530 --> 00:34:09.420 align:middle line:84%
and way over on
the other side, he

00:34:09.420 --> 00:34:13.679 align:middle line:84%
had this group called
left systematists.

00:34:13.679 --> 00:34:17.340 align:middle line:84%
And immediately inside on this
spectrum that he had designed,

00:34:17.340 --> 00:34:21.270 align:middle line:84%
this sociological bar
graph, he had another group

00:34:21.270 --> 00:34:28.170 align:middle line:84%
that was, he said, that were
left marginalists and right

00:34:28.170 --> 00:34:30.510 align:middle line:90%
marginalists just inside that.

00:34:30.510 --> 00:34:32.520 align:middle line:84%
And then a group called
middle marginalists

00:34:32.520 --> 00:34:34.159 align:middle line:90%
to no one's surprise.

00:34:34.159 --> 00:34:35.699 align:middle line:90%
It was the middle marginalists.

00:34:35.699 --> 00:34:37.560 align:middle line:84%
And so he just laid
these people out.

00:34:37.560 --> 00:34:39.570 align:middle line:84%
And he said you go around
interviewing people.

00:34:39.570 --> 00:34:40.370 align:middle line:90%
[PHONE RINGING]

00:34:40.370 --> 00:34:42.060 align:middle line:84%
And what he
discovered-- this must

00:34:42.060 --> 00:34:43.350 align:middle line:90%
be Talcott Parsons right now.

00:34:43.350 --> 00:34:45.290 align:middle line:90%
He thinks I don't have it right.

00:34:45.290 --> 00:34:46.530 align:middle line:90%
No, it's not him.

00:34:46.530 --> 00:34:47.760 align:middle line:90%
Some guy from prison.

00:34:47.760 --> 00:34:50.520 align:middle line:90%
Oh, gee.

00:34:50.520 --> 00:34:52.020 align:middle line:90%
Anyway.

00:34:52.020 --> 00:34:57.400 align:middle line:90%
So the bottom line is--

00:34:57.400 --> 00:35:01.500 align:middle line:84%
so he came up with these
five different factions

00:35:01.500 --> 00:35:04.980 align:middle line:84%
that our human family
tends to break into.

00:35:04.980 --> 00:35:09.270 align:middle line:84%
And so what I did is I
started looking at these.

00:35:09.270 --> 00:35:10.710 align:middle line:90%
And I came up--

00:35:10.710 --> 00:35:12.840 align:middle line:84%
I was doing my master's
thesis on this.

00:35:12.840 --> 00:35:16.090 align:middle line:84%
And rather than-- what they want
to do is they assign you one--

00:35:16.090 --> 00:35:18.810 align:middle line:84%
you pick one of these
major public policy issues,

00:35:18.810 --> 00:35:21.747 align:middle line:84%
like affirmative
action, whether or not

00:35:21.747 --> 00:35:24.330 align:middle line:84%
there should be an equal rights
amendment to the Constitution.

00:35:24.330 --> 00:35:26.250 align:middle line:84%
You pick one of these
public policy issues.

00:35:26.250 --> 00:35:28.292 align:middle line:84%
And then you're supposed
to go around researching

00:35:28.292 --> 00:35:30.660 align:middle line:84%
all the people that
have spoken on the issue

00:35:30.660 --> 00:35:33.210 align:middle line:84%
and break them up into
these five factions.

00:35:33.210 --> 00:35:35.880 align:middle line:84%
And what I did is I came
to believe that there were

00:35:35.880 --> 00:35:40.710 align:middle line:84%
actually in addition to the
right systematists and right

00:35:40.710 --> 00:35:42.600 align:middle line:84%
marginalists, there
was a group called

00:35:42.600 --> 00:35:45.720 align:middle line:84%
right middle
marginalists that were

00:35:45.720 --> 00:35:48.280 align:middle line:84%
in between the middle
marginalists and there.

00:35:48.280 --> 00:35:50.580 align:middle line:84%
And the same thing
was true on the left,

00:35:50.580 --> 00:35:52.380 align:middle line:84%
that they were not
only left systematists

00:35:52.380 --> 00:35:54.930 align:middle line:84%
and left marginalists, but
left middle marginalists, which

00:35:54.930 --> 00:35:59.150 align:middle line:84%
were the classic liberals
and conservatives,

00:35:59.150 --> 00:36:01.800 align:middle line:84%
classic liberal and
conservative positions

00:36:01.800 --> 00:36:04.480 align:middle line:84%
that he hadn't even
taken into account.

00:36:04.480 --> 00:36:06.300 align:middle line:84%
And so I was doing
my master's thesis

00:36:06.300 --> 00:36:11.862 align:middle line:84%
actually critiquing the founder
of the department of sociology

00:36:11.862 --> 00:36:13.070 align:middle line:90%
at the department of Harvard.

00:36:13.070 --> 00:36:14.920 align:middle line:84%
It wasn't the most
popular thing to do,

00:36:14.920 --> 00:36:17.440 align:middle line:90%
but I was convinced it was true.

00:36:17.440 --> 00:36:20.250 align:middle line:84%
And so I started talking to
Ralph Potter, saying to him,

00:36:20.250 --> 00:36:22.260 align:middle line:90%
look it.

00:36:22.260 --> 00:36:24.905 align:middle line:84%
Because I was a lawyer
and I was asking questions

00:36:24.905 --> 00:36:27.030 align:middle line:84%
that were a little bit
different than other people,

00:36:27.030 --> 00:36:28.020 align:middle line:90%
other students did.

00:36:28.020 --> 00:36:30.360 align:middle line:84%
And I said, look,
what is it that

00:36:30.360 --> 00:36:34.780 align:middle line:84%
causes a person to be in one
of these groups or the other?

00:36:34.780 --> 00:36:36.940 align:middle line:84%
And he said, well,
that's interesting.

00:36:36.940 --> 00:36:40.180 align:middle line:84%
He said, that's what I did
my PhD work on, he said,

00:36:40.180 --> 00:36:41.860 align:middle line:90%
under Talcott Parsons.

00:36:41.860 --> 00:36:45.628 align:middle line:84%
And what he came
to believe is this.

00:36:45.628 --> 00:36:47.170 align:middle line:84%
And this is what's
important for you.

00:36:47.170 --> 00:36:49.087 align:middle line:84%
And I want to see everybody
taking notes here.

00:36:49.087 --> 00:36:51.440 align:middle line:84%
This is the tough
part of the seminar.

00:36:51.440 --> 00:36:53.560 align:middle line:84%
But what he decided
is that there

00:36:53.560 --> 00:37:00.780 align:middle line:84%
were four fundamental pillar
beliefs that every human being

00:37:00.780 --> 00:37:03.510 align:middle line:84%
has to form some
kind of an opinion

00:37:03.510 --> 00:37:07.020 align:middle line:84%
about if they're going to be
able to function effectively

00:37:07.020 --> 00:37:09.420 align:middle line:90%
in the world.

00:37:09.420 --> 00:37:11.722 align:middle line:90%
And what these are, they--

00:37:11.722 --> 00:37:13.680 align:middle line:84%
if I had the little chart,
I'd show you there's

00:37:13.680 --> 00:37:17.040 align:middle line:84%
this great big four square,
a great big four square,

00:37:17.040 --> 00:37:19.020 align:middle line:90%
like you play Four Square.

00:37:19.020 --> 00:37:22.470 align:middle line:84%
And there's four of these
fundamental beliefs.

00:37:22.470 --> 00:37:29.220 align:middle line:84%
And the first one is
cosmology, which is, how is it

00:37:29.220 --> 00:37:33.710 align:middle line:84%
that you think the
universe came into being?

00:37:33.710 --> 00:37:37.120 align:middle line:84%
These are profound and
fundamental questions

00:37:37.120 --> 00:37:39.580 align:middle line:84%
that have to do with your
understanding of reality

00:37:39.580 --> 00:37:40.960 align:middle line:90%
itself.

00:37:40.960 --> 00:37:45.060 align:middle line:84%
And the second issue
after cosmology

00:37:45.060 --> 00:37:52.150 align:middle line:84%
about how the cosmos came into
being is another big fancy word

00:37:52.150 --> 00:37:53.710 align:middle line:90%
called teleology.

00:37:53.710 --> 00:37:57.670 align:middle line:84%
And that is how do you believe
the universe is unfolding?

00:37:57.670 --> 00:37:59.380 align:middle line:84%
Do you think the
universe is unfolding

00:37:59.380 --> 00:38:02.170 align:middle line:84%
pursuant to some sort
of laws, natural laws,

00:38:02.170 --> 00:38:05.270 align:middle line:84%
and there's some
sort of end in mind,

00:38:05.270 --> 00:38:08.740 align:middle line:84%
there's some sort of
objective that is unfolding

00:38:08.740 --> 00:38:11.930 align:middle line:90%
in the universe or not?

00:38:11.930 --> 00:38:15.360 align:middle line:84%
Then the fourth one
is the other big word.

00:38:15.360 --> 00:38:17.560 align:middle line:84%
It's called-- but you'll
see how important this one.

00:38:17.560 --> 00:38:19.030 align:middle line:90%
It's ontology.

00:38:19.030 --> 00:38:22.030 align:middle line:84%
What is your
ontological conclusion?

00:38:22.030 --> 00:38:27.240 align:middle line:84%
That is how did consciousness
come into being?

00:38:27.240 --> 00:38:29.440 align:middle line:84%
It's a good thing for this
weekend to talk about.

00:38:29.440 --> 00:38:32.050 align:middle line:84%
How did consciousness
come into being?

00:38:32.050 --> 00:38:34.420 align:middle line:84%
Is consciousness just
sort of an epiphenomenon

00:38:34.420 --> 00:38:37.180 align:middle line:84%
between the kind of random
collision between mass

00:38:37.180 --> 00:38:39.730 align:middle line:84%
and energy or units
of mass encountering

00:38:39.730 --> 00:38:42.880 align:middle line:84%
each other in an organism,
that somehow this

00:38:42.880 --> 00:38:44.970 align:middle line:84%
is an epiphenomenon
of some sort,

00:38:44.970 --> 00:38:48.310 align:middle line:90%
like an overtone of music?

00:38:48.310 --> 00:38:51.700 align:middle line:84%
How did consciousness come
into being in this otherwise

00:38:51.700 --> 00:38:54.720 align:middle line:90%
strictly material universe?

00:38:54.720 --> 00:38:56.860 align:middle line:84%
And the fourth and
final of these,

00:38:56.860 --> 00:39:00.340 align:middle line:84%
of Potter's box, the
four square, the one

00:39:00.340 --> 00:39:02.730 align:middle line:90%
is epistemology.

00:39:02.730 --> 00:39:04.870 align:middle line:84%
And now this is
another big word for,

00:39:04.870 --> 00:39:10.600 align:middle line:84%
what are the means that we have
at our disposal as human beings

00:39:10.600 --> 00:39:14.530 align:middle line:84%
to be able to answer
cosmic questions like that?

00:39:14.530 --> 00:39:19.150 align:middle line:84%
Are we limited to just what
we can see and taste and touch

00:39:19.150 --> 00:39:20.230 align:middle line:90%
and smell?

00:39:20.230 --> 00:39:24.258 align:middle line:84%
Are we limited to our five
senses as taking in data

00:39:24.258 --> 00:39:26.050 align:middle line:84%
and then putting them
through our intellect

00:39:26.050 --> 00:39:28.630 align:middle line:84%
to try to figure out what the
answer to these things are?

00:39:28.630 --> 00:39:33.550 align:middle line:84%
Or are there other means
that we have at our disposal?

00:39:33.550 --> 00:39:37.470 align:middle line:84%
Such as, for example,
ESP, or channeling.

00:39:37.470 --> 00:39:42.490 align:middle line:84%
There's all kinds of other means
that certain people hypothesize

00:39:42.490 --> 00:39:44.320 align:middle line:90%
exist.

00:39:44.320 --> 00:39:47.260 align:middle line:84%
It answers the
epistemological question.

00:39:47.260 --> 00:39:52.660 align:middle line:84%
And what they discovered is that
there are entirely different

00:39:52.660 --> 00:39:56.230 align:middle line:84%
answers that people provide
to these four questions.

00:39:56.230 --> 00:39:58.630 align:middle line:84%
How did the universe
come into being?

00:39:58.630 --> 00:40:01.690 align:middle line:84%
How is the universe unfolding
toward any particular end

00:40:01.690 --> 00:40:04.240 align:middle line:90%
or objective or purpose?

00:40:04.240 --> 00:40:06.760 align:middle line:84%
How did consciousness
come into being?

00:40:06.760 --> 00:40:09.760 align:middle line:84%
And what means do we have at our
disposal by means of which we

00:40:09.760 --> 00:40:11.890 align:middle line:90%
can ascertain those truths?

00:40:11.890 --> 00:40:14.590 align:middle line:84%
There are different answers
that you can come up

00:40:14.590 --> 00:40:15.970 align:middle line:90%
with to those questions.

00:40:15.970 --> 00:40:18.118 align:middle line:84%
And it is important,
absolutely essential

00:40:18.118 --> 00:40:19.660 align:middle line:84%
that we put a little
bookmark on this

00:40:19.660 --> 00:40:23.470 align:middle line:84%
to say that nobody knows
the answer to those things.

00:40:23.470 --> 00:40:27.290 align:middle line:84%
Nobody knows the definitive
answer to those things.

00:40:27.290 --> 00:40:31.000 align:middle line:84%
But the fact is it's impossible
to function in the world

00:40:31.000 --> 00:40:33.100 align:middle line:84%
without you at least
unconsciously coming

00:40:33.100 --> 00:40:35.680 align:middle line:84%
to some conclusion
about those things

00:40:35.680 --> 00:40:38.050 align:middle line:84%
even if you don't think
about it consciously.

00:40:38.050 --> 00:40:45.160 align:middle line:84%
And what they discovered is that
if in fact you answer all four

00:40:45.160 --> 00:40:48.430 align:middle line:84%
of those questions,
the questions

00:40:48.430 --> 00:40:51.917 align:middle line:84%
as to how the universe came
into being, how it's unfolding,

00:40:51.917 --> 00:40:54.250 align:middle line:84%
or whether it's unfolding
toward a particular point, how

00:40:54.250 --> 00:40:56.792 align:middle line:84%
consciousness came into being,
and what the means are that we

00:40:56.792 --> 00:41:00.520 align:middle line:84%
have at our disposal to
ascertain that information,

00:41:00.520 --> 00:41:02.860 align:middle line:84%
if you answer all four
of those questions

00:41:02.860 --> 00:41:08.380 align:middle line:84%
in a way that is internally
and self-referential consistent

00:41:08.380 --> 00:41:10.600 align:middle line:84%
so that all three
of the other answers

00:41:10.600 --> 00:41:13.360 align:middle line:84%
are consistent with whatever the
answer is that you gave to one

00:41:13.360 --> 00:41:16.120 align:middle line:84%
of them, that if you
answer those four

00:41:16.120 --> 00:41:17.950 align:middle line:84%
questions in a way
that is internally

00:41:17.950 --> 00:41:21.040 align:middle line:84%
and self-referential
consistent, what you have

00:41:21.040 --> 00:41:22.420 align:middle line:90%
is that you generate,

00:41:22.420 --> 00:41:26.770 align:middle line:84%
you discern a common principle
that is underlying the answer

00:41:26.770 --> 00:41:28.300 align:middle line:90%
to each one of those questions.

00:41:28.300 --> 00:41:30.400 align:middle line:84%
You come up with
a principle that

00:41:30.400 --> 00:41:35.820 align:middle line:84%
generates a specific mode
of ethical reasoning.

00:41:35.820 --> 00:41:38.100 align:middle line:84%
And I want to be clear
about what this means.

00:41:38.100 --> 00:41:41.250 align:middle line:84%
Everybody engages
in conduct which

00:41:41.250 --> 00:41:46.980 align:middle line:84%
they think is consistent
with reality, right?

00:41:46.980 --> 00:41:49.170 align:middle line:84%
I mean, that's the
ethical thing to do

00:41:49.170 --> 00:41:51.930 align:middle line:84%
is you choose to comport
your conduct in accordance

00:41:51.930 --> 00:41:55.690 align:middle line:84%
with reality with the
exception of some major people

00:41:55.690 --> 00:41:56.490 align:middle line:90%
that we know.

00:41:56.490 --> 00:41:59.960 align:middle line:90%


00:41:59.960 --> 00:42:03.390 align:middle line:84%
But the bottom line is
that that's the ethical way

00:42:03.390 --> 00:42:04.850 align:middle line:90%
of conducting yourself.

00:42:04.850 --> 00:42:07.930 align:middle line:84%
You may have a different
view of what reality is,

00:42:07.930 --> 00:42:10.320 align:middle line:84%
but as long as you're
engaging in conduct

00:42:10.320 --> 00:42:14.250 align:middle line:84%
that is consistent with what
you legitimately believe reality

00:42:14.250 --> 00:42:16.360 align:middle line:84%
to be, that's an
ethical position.

00:42:16.360 --> 00:42:17.160 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:42:17.160 --> 00:42:20.400 align:middle line:84%
And so there are different
modes of ethical reasoning

00:42:20.400 --> 00:42:24.270 align:middle line:84%
that are generated by different
answers to those questions.

00:42:24.270 --> 00:42:26.640 align:middle line:84%
And what we came
to understand is

00:42:26.640 --> 00:42:32.850 align:middle line:84%
that based on this analysis
of Talcott Parsons's

00:42:32.850 --> 00:42:36.120 align:middle line:84%
ideological spectrum
that goes all the way

00:42:36.120 --> 00:42:41.965 align:middle line:84%
from a right systematist all the
way over to a left systematist,

00:42:41.965 --> 00:42:45.480 align:middle line:84%
with those seven major
nodal points along there,

00:42:45.480 --> 00:42:47.938 align:middle line:84%
from right systematist
to right marginalist

00:42:47.938 --> 00:42:49.980 align:middle line:84%
to right middle marginalist
to middle marginalist

00:42:49.980 --> 00:42:52.560 align:middle line:84%
to left middle marginalist
to left marginalist

00:42:52.560 --> 00:42:54.720 align:middle line:84%
to the left
systematist, those seven

00:42:54.720 --> 00:42:57.810 align:middle line:84%
nodal points along the
sociological bar graph,

00:42:57.810 --> 00:43:02.460 align:middle line:84%
that they all are--
what they have in common

00:43:02.460 --> 00:43:05.820 align:middle line:84%
is each one of them provides
an answer to all four

00:43:05.820 --> 00:43:08.220 align:middle line:84%
of those questions
which is internally

00:43:08.220 --> 00:43:12.740 align:middle line:84%
and self-referential consistent
with the other three.

00:43:12.740 --> 00:43:15.570 align:middle line:84%
And so that's what
generates a consistent mode

00:43:15.570 --> 00:43:17.730 align:middle line:84%
of ethical reasoning
for these people.

00:43:17.730 --> 00:43:21.740 align:middle line:84%
And so they have a worldview,
a whole world view.

00:43:21.740 --> 00:43:25.070 align:middle line:84%
And if you apply the
principles of that worldview

00:43:25.070 --> 00:43:27.860 align:middle line:84%
to answering all the normal
questions that you encounter

00:43:27.860 --> 00:43:30.710 align:middle line:84%
in your workday
life, it generates

00:43:30.710 --> 00:43:33.860 align:middle line:90%
a full-blown philosophy.

00:43:33.860 --> 00:43:36.290 align:middle line:84%
That's where
philosophies come from.

00:43:36.290 --> 00:43:37.790 align:middle line:84%
When you actually
get into read--

00:43:37.790 --> 00:43:39.530 align:middle line:84%
I mean, people who don't
know any better just

00:43:39.530 --> 00:43:41.120 align:middle line:84%
keep reading all these
different philosophers.

00:43:41.120 --> 00:43:42.800 align:middle line:84%
And they say this,
and they say that.

00:43:42.800 --> 00:43:44.450 align:middle line:84%
But what they're
doing is they're

00:43:44.450 --> 00:43:48.650 align:middle line:84%
offering a systematic analysis
of fundamental questions coming

00:43:48.650 --> 00:43:52.120 align:middle line:84%
from a consistent point of
view and a consistent mode

00:43:52.120 --> 00:43:53.520 align:middle line:90%
of ethical reasoning.

00:43:53.520 --> 00:43:57.560 align:middle line:84%
And that's what generates
the major philosophers.

00:43:57.560 --> 00:44:00.560 align:middle line:84%
So that's extraordinarily
important,

00:44:00.560 --> 00:44:05.060 align:middle line:84%
because what you discover
is that a subfunction

00:44:05.060 --> 00:44:09.830 align:middle line:84%
of your philosophy is
your political philosophy.

00:44:09.830 --> 00:44:12.200 align:middle line:84%
Your political philosophy
flows directly out

00:44:12.200 --> 00:44:13.033 align:middle line:90%
of your philosophy.

00:44:13.033 --> 00:44:15.200 align:middle line:84%
What you're doing is you're
applying your philosophy

00:44:15.200 --> 00:44:18.770 align:middle line:84%
to the question of how do you go
about addressing public policy

00:44:18.770 --> 00:44:22.190 align:middle line:90%
questions in a community.

00:44:22.190 --> 00:44:24.860 align:middle line:84%
When you're faced with a
range of potential responses

00:44:24.860 --> 00:44:26.540 align:middle line:84%
to a given public
policy problem,

00:44:26.540 --> 00:44:28.790 align:middle line:84%
how do you select
which one you want?

00:44:28.790 --> 00:44:31.560 align:middle line:84%
You apply a mode of
ethical reasoning to that.

00:44:31.560 --> 00:44:33.290 align:middle line:84%
And so what we see,
this is the one that

00:44:33.290 --> 00:44:35.090 align:middle line:90%
is most common to everybody.

00:44:35.090 --> 00:44:37.670 align:middle line:84%
This is where you get
the normal right wing

00:44:37.670 --> 00:44:39.480 align:middle line:90%
and left wing people.

00:44:39.480 --> 00:44:40.280 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:44:40.280 --> 00:44:42.890 align:middle line:84%
Because on the extreme
right, the right

00:44:42.890 --> 00:44:45.800 align:middle line:84%
systematists, the
political philosophy

00:44:45.800 --> 00:44:50.700 align:middle line:84%
that is generic to the right
systematist authoritarianism.

00:44:50.700 --> 00:44:54.520 align:middle line:84%
And you come into the
right marginalists

00:44:54.520 --> 00:44:57.300 align:middle line:90%
and they are reactionaries.

00:44:57.300 --> 00:45:01.380 align:middle line:84%
And you come in one step more to
the right middle marginalists,

00:45:01.380 --> 00:45:03.510 align:middle line:90%
and they're conservatives.

00:45:03.510 --> 00:45:05.490 align:middle line:84%
And you come into the
middle marginalist,

00:45:05.490 --> 00:45:08.880 align:middle line:84%
and they're moderates,
to no surprise.

00:45:08.880 --> 00:45:14.310 align:middle line:84%
You go to the left of center,
to the left middle marginalists,

00:45:14.310 --> 00:45:16.320 align:middle line:90%
and you get liberals.

00:45:16.320 --> 00:45:18.510 align:middle line:84%
And you go to the
left marginalists,

00:45:18.510 --> 00:45:20.640 align:middle line:90%
and you get progressives.

00:45:20.640 --> 00:45:24.180 align:middle line:84%
And you get to the far left
of the left systematists,

00:45:24.180 --> 00:45:26.470 align:middle line:90%
and you get utopianists.

00:45:26.470 --> 00:45:27.270 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:45:27.270 --> 00:45:28.800 align:middle line:90%
So now we're talking.

00:45:28.800 --> 00:45:31.950 align:middle line:84%
Now we're into something
that people understand.

00:45:31.950 --> 00:45:35.400 align:middle line:84%
But the fact is they don't
understand where it comes from.

00:45:35.400 --> 00:45:38.720 align:middle line:84%
And they don't understand
what it means, you see?

00:45:38.720 --> 00:45:41.850 align:middle line:84%
And so people sling these ideas
around all over the place.

00:45:41.850 --> 00:45:43.350 align:middle line:84%
You know, ah, he's
an authoritarian.

00:45:43.350 --> 00:45:45.210 align:middle line:90%
He's some kind of reactionary.

00:45:45.210 --> 00:45:48.450 align:middle line:84%
Or somebody's some kind
of soft-headed liberal.

00:45:48.450 --> 00:45:51.900 align:middle line:84%
And they don't even
know what it means,

00:45:51.900 --> 00:45:54.090 align:middle line:84%
but they just have some
vague idea where they fall

00:45:54.090 --> 00:45:55.830 align:middle line:90%
along the political spectrum.

00:45:55.830 --> 00:45:59.280 align:middle line:84%
But what this shows
is that there are full

00:45:59.280 --> 00:46:03.870 align:middle line:84%
scale scientific logical
ways of figuring out why it

00:46:03.870 --> 00:46:05.740 align:middle line:90%
is that people do what they do.

00:46:05.740 --> 00:46:06.540 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:46:06.540 --> 00:46:10.650 align:middle line:84%
And what I discovered in going
through all this, I said--

00:46:10.650 --> 00:46:13.590 align:middle line:84%
now we're getting
into this weekend--

00:46:13.590 --> 00:46:16.260 align:middle line:84%
what I discovered is
that the charisms that

00:46:16.260 --> 00:46:20.190 align:middle line:84%
are attached to these seven
different nodal points

00:46:20.190 --> 00:46:23.850 align:middle line:84%
along the sociological bar
graph, the charisms that

00:46:23.850 --> 00:46:26.700 align:middle line:84%
are characteristic of
each of those nodal points

00:46:26.700 --> 00:46:29.010 align:middle line:84%
are exactly the same
characteristics that

00:46:29.010 --> 00:46:35.430 align:middle line:84%
are attributed to the
chakras, and that you

00:46:35.430 --> 00:46:40.320 align:middle line:84%
get these right systematists
are deeply rooted

00:46:40.320 --> 00:46:42.330 align:middle line:90%
in their root chakra.

00:46:42.330 --> 00:46:44.460 align:middle line:90%
I mean, red-red, you know?

00:46:44.460 --> 00:46:46.960 align:middle line:84%
And they're totally
clinging to life.

00:46:46.960 --> 00:46:48.720 align:middle line:90%
They're totally insecure.

00:46:48.720 --> 00:46:50.910 align:middle line:84%
They're constantly
fearful that they're

00:46:50.910 --> 00:46:54.860 align:middle line:84%
going to die or disappear
or be disempowered.

00:46:54.860 --> 00:46:59.800 align:middle line:84%
And so they react in a very
classic way all the time.

00:46:59.800 --> 00:47:00.630 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:47:00.630 --> 00:47:01.560 align:middle line:90%
And this happens.

00:47:01.560 --> 00:47:04.170 align:middle line:84%
And it goes-- if
you're familiar at all

00:47:04.170 --> 00:47:07.530 align:middle line:84%
with the charisms of the
different chakras, what you'll

00:47:07.530 --> 00:47:11.250 align:middle line:84%
see, you start to line
them up with these seven,

00:47:11.250 --> 00:47:14.700 align:middle line:84%
and you'll discover that
these charisms match

00:47:14.700 --> 00:47:16.860 align:middle line:90%
almost identically.

00:47:16.860 --> 00:47:19.320 align:middle line:84%
And so for the first
time, you start to say,

00:47:19.320 --> 00:47:24.600 align:middle line:84%
well, this may begin to
explain why a person adheres

00:47:24.600 --> 00:47:26.310 align:middle line:90%
to one of those worldviews.

00:47:26.310 --> 00:47:28.830 align:middle line:84%
What happens is that
when you look at this

00:47:28.830 --> 00:47:31.650 align:middle line:84%
and you start to
compare and contrast

00:47:31.650 --> 00:47:34.770 align:middle line:84%
the fundamental
charisms of the chakras

00:47:34.770 --> 00:47:38.160 align:middle line:84%
with these charisms of
these particular worldviews,

00:47:38.160 --> 00:47:41.422 align:middle line:84%
what you discover is a
very important thing.

00:47:41.422 --> 00:47:46.470 align:middle line:84%
And that is that there's got to
be an eighth world view because

00:47:46.470 --> 00:47:48.610 align:middle line:90%
of the eighth chakra.

00:47:48.610 --> 00:47:51.320 align:middle line:84%
The chakra that
exists above your head

00:47:51.320 --> 00:47:53.750 align:middle line:84%
at the top of the
energy envelopes

00:47:53.750 --> 00:47:56.740 align:middle line:84%
that are generated by
the chakras in your body,

00:47:56.740 --> 00:48:00.110 align:middle line:84%
that you have these seven
energy envelopes that are each

00:48:00.110 --> 00:48:02.480 align:middle line:84%
generated by the
chakra, the energy

00:48:02.480 --> 00:48:04.430 align:middle line:84%
of its particular
vibrational frequency,

00:48:04.430 --> 00:48:08.270 align:middle line:84%
its particular rate of spin, its
particular tip to the ecliptic,

00:48:08.270 --> 00:48:12.030 align:middle line:84%
That these are energy fields
that form around your body.

00:48:12.030 --> 00:48:14.930 align:middle line:84%
And at the apex of all
of this, these envelopes,

00:48:14.930 --> 00:48:18.340 align:middle line:90%
there's an eighth chakra.

00:48:18.340 --> 00:48:21.000 align:middle line:84%
So there's got to be
an eighth world view.

00:48:21.000 --> 00:48:23.690 align:middle line:90%
And so what is that world view?

00:48:23.690 --> 00:48:26.570 align:middle line:84%
This is the world
view that we're

00:48:26.570 --> 00:48:31.740 align:middle line:84%
bumping into all the time
with the extraterrestrials.

00:48:31.740 --> 00:48:34.500 align:middle line:84%
This is the thing that we
aren't understanding at all.

00:48:34.500 --> 00:48:37.020 align:middle line:84%
There's something
just out of our reach,

00:48:37.020 --> 00:48:39.440 align:middle line:90%
just out of our comprehension.

00:48:39.440 --> 00:48:41.970 align:middle line:84%
There's things happening
with these, folks.

00:48:41.970 --> 00:48:43.650 align:middle line:84%
They go faster than
the speed of light.

00:48:43.650 --> 00:48:45.360 align:middle line:84%
They materialize
and dematerialize.

00:48:45.360 --> 00:48:46.950 align:middle line:90%
They move through walls.

00:48:46.950 --> 00:48:50.730 align:middle line:84%
They don't seem to be bound
by our limitations of time.

00:48:50.730 --> 00:48:53.740 align:middle line:84%
There's something completely
mysterious going on.

00:48:53.740 --> 00:48:59.790 align:middle line:84%
And so what I'm saying is that
the genuinely new paradigm

00:48:59.790 --> 00:49:03.760 align:middle line:84%
is not just the sixth
paradigm quantum world

00:49:03.760 --> 00:49:07.890 align:middle line:84%
view, which is the basic
progressive worldview

00:49:07.890 --> 00:49:10.620 align:middle line:84%
that everybody believes in
quantum physics basically

00:49:10.620 --> 00:49:12.450 align:middle line:84%
ends up being kind
of a progressive,

00:49:12.450 --> 00:49:15.390 align:middle line:84%
because they think that their
direct intention can influence

00:49:15.390 --> 00:49:18.670 align:middle line:84%
the manifestation of matter
in the next microsecond,

00:49:18.670 --> 00:49:22.650 align:middle line:84%
and we can all sing "Kumbaya"
together and make the world

00:49:22.650 --> 00:49:24.370 align:middle line:90%
a better place.

00:49:24.370 --> 00:49:27.690 align:middle line:84%
This is the progressive
worldview, and that

00:49:27.690 --> 00:49:29.350 align:middle line:90%
all of us at the present time--

00:49:29.350 --> 00:49:31.720 align:middle line:84%
we're going to have the next
part of this conversation.

00:49:31.720 --> 00:49:33.930 align:middle line:90%
This is a very important one.

00:49:33.930 --> 00:49:35.610 align:middle line:84%
It may sound like
what I'm saying

00:49:35.610 --> 00:49:38.610 align:middle line:84%
is that you shouldn't attach
yourself to the sixth paradigm

00:49:38.610 --> 00:49:41.640 align:middle line:84%
quantum worldview as the
new paradigm worldview,

00:49:41.640 --> 00:49:43.890 align:middle line:84%
but I'm going to
suggest that we should,

00:49:43.890 --> 00:49:46.800 align:middle line:84%
because that's the next one
that's opening up for us all.

00:49:46.800 --> 00:49:49.610 align:middle line:90%
It's the sixth chakra.

00:49:49.610 --> 00:49:51.090 align:middle line:90%
It's the pituitary chakra.

00:49:51.090 --> 00:49:53.160 align:middle line:84%
It's the one that
has to do with ESP.

00:49:53.160 --> 00:49:54.960 align:middle line:84%
It's the one that has
to do with telepathy.

00:49:54.960 --> 00:49:58.800 align:middle line:84%
It's the one that has to
do with teleportation.

00:49:58.800 --> 00:50:01.050 align:middle line:84%
There's all kinds
of charisms that

00:50:01.050 --> 00:50:03.420 align:middle line:84%
are generic to
this sixth paradigm

00:50:03.420 --> 00:50:07.140 align:middle line:84%
worldview in this quantum
realm that we're talking about.

00:50:07.140 --> 00:50:09.840 align:middle line:84%
And the thing that tom me
is so important about this

00:50:09.840 --> 00:50:13.200 align:middle line:90%
is that the seventh--

00:50:13.200 --> 00:50:15.540 align:middle line:84%
let me give you a
classic example just

00:50:15.540 --> 00:50:18.160 align:middle line:90%
so we'll get grounded here.

00:50:18.160 --> 00:50:21.630 align:middle line:84%
And that is let's deal with
just one of these four pillar

00:50:21.630 --> 00:50:23.550 align:middle line:90%
beliefs of cosmology.

00:50:23.550 --> 00:50:24.540 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:50:24.540 --> 00:50:28.230 align:middle line:84%
The adherents to the right
systematist worldview

00:50:28.230 --> 00:50:33.310 align:middle line:84%
believe that they recognize
that our universe is expanding.

00:50:33.310 --> 00:50:36.120 align:middle line:84%
They recognize that all the
elements on the periodic table

00:50:36.120 --> 00:50:41.430 align:middle line:84%
chart are disintegrating into
their constituent elements.

00:50:41.430 --> 00:50:43.890 align:middle line:84%
And so they're
expanding out in a way

00:50:43.890 --> 00:50:46.230 align:middle line:84%
from the original
locus of the big bang

00:50:46.230 --> 00:50:49.000 align:middle line:84%
and disintegrating
and expanding.

00:50:49.000 --> 00:50:51.360 align:middle line:84%
And what they
conclude is that this

00:50:51.360 --> 00:50:56.010 align:middle line:84%
is going to continue going
on until every single element

00:50:56.010 --> 00:50:58.500 align:middle line:84%
in the universe
has disintegrated

00:50:58.500 --> 00:51:03.000 align:middle line:84%
into its component
inchoate quantum fields,

00:51:03.000 --> 00:51:05.620 align:middle line:84%
and they're going to
continue to expand.

00:51:05.620 --> 00:51:08.430 align:middle line:84%
And it's going to, therefore,
expand out into nothingness.

00:51:08.430 --> 00:51:11.730 align:middle line:90%


00:51:11.730 --> 00:51:15.100 align:middle line:84%
That's the absolute
entropy of the universe.

00:51:15.100 --> 00:51:18.480 align:middle line:84%
And so that's what they
believe is going on,

00:51:18.480 --> 00:51:21.970 align:middle line:84%
both cosmically
and teleologically.

00:51:21.970 --> 00:51:22.770 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:51:22.770 --> 00:51:25.470 align:middle line:10%
That's a pretty
depressing worldview,

00:51:25.470 --> 00:51:27.960 align:middle line:10%
because it leads them
to believe that there's

00:51:27.960 --> 00:51:30.690 align:middle line:10%
no point to anything.

00:51:30.690 --> 00:51:32.430 align:middle line:84%
The only thing that
makes any difference

00:51:32.430 --> 00:51:35.790 align:middle line:84%
is them asserting themselves
and asserting control

00:51:35.790 --> 00:51:38.610 align:middle line:84%
over an otherwise
chaotic universe

00:51:38.610 --> 00:51:43.570 align:middle line:84%
through the application of brute
force or better intelligence,

00:51:43.570 --> 00:51:47.220 align:middle line:84%
but just dominating
everybody and taking control.

00:51:47.220 --> 00:51:51.840 align:middle line:84%
Now, the reactionaries,
the right marginalists,

00:51:51.840 --> 00:51:54.660 align:middle line:84%
they believe that the universe
is expanding out and away

00:51:54.660 --> 00:51:57.900 align:middle line:84%
from the original big bang,
and in fact, all the elements

00:51:57.900 --> 00:51:59.560 align:middle line:90%
are disintegrating.

00:51:59.560 --> 00:52:02.160 align:middle line:84%
But they believe that
when you get to the point

00:52:02.160 --> 00:52:04.770 align:middle line:84%
where every single element
on the periodic table

00:52:04.770 --> 00:52:07.710 align:middle line:84%
has disintegrated into its
respective inchoate quantum

00:52:07.710 --> 00:52:11.940 align:middle line:84%
fields and it expands to
that particular point, what

00:52:11.940 --> 00:52:14.310 align:middle line:84%
will happen is the
impetus of the big bang

00:52:14.310 --> 00:52:16.950 align:middle line:84%
will have been exhausted,
and that there'll

00:52:16.950 --> 00:52:19.680 align:middle line:84%
be this stasis, a
moment of stasis.

00:52:19.680 --> 00:52:22.290 align:middle line:84%
And the bonding attraction
that every single unit

00:52:22.290 --> 00:52:25.650 align:middle line:84%
has for every other one
will then take over.

00:52:25.650 --> 00:52:28.950 align:middle line:84%
And there will be this moment,
this micro moment of stasis,

00:52:28.950 --> 00:52:31.920 align:middle line:84%
and then it'll all start
coming back together again.

00:52:31.920 --> 00:52:33.870 align:middle line:84%
And all of those
inchoate quantum fields

00:52:33.870 --> 00:52:35.520 align:middle line:84%
will start joining
together to form

00:52:35.520 --> 00:52:40.140 align:middle line:84%
leptons and muons and
squarks and electrons

00:52:40.140 --> 00:52:44.400 align:middle line:84%
and protons and neutrons
and stars and galaxies

00:52:44.400 --> 00:52:47.700 align:middle line:84%
and living conscious
beings that are a function

00:52:47.700 --> 00:52:49.560 align:middle line:90%
of this particular process.

00:52:49.560 --> 00:52:52.230 align:middle line:84%
And they will continue
to come back together,

00:52:52.230 --> 00:52:54.690 align:middle line:84%
tighter and tighter and
tighter and tighter,

00:52:54.690 --> 00:52:58.740 align:middle line:84%
until they all collapse
back into the point

00:52:58.740 --> 00:53:01.080 align:middle line:84%
where every single
inchoate quantum

00:53:01.080 --> 00:53:04.650 align:middle line:84%
field in the entire universe
is in direct physical contact

00:53:04.650 --> 00:53:07.080 align:middle line:90%
with every other one.

00:53:07.080 --> 00:53:08.780 align:middle line:84%
And that's the
little pinhead you

00:53:08.780 --> 00:53:11.580 align:middle line:84%
keep hearing about all the
time that these astrophysicists

00:53:11.580 --> 00:53:12.380 align:middle line:90%
talk about.

00:53:12.380 --> 00:53:15.890 align:middle line:84%
The entire universe exists
at the size of a pinhead.

00:53:15.890 --> 00:53:16.850 align:middle line:90%
Remember that one?

00:53:16.850 --> 00:53:18.350 align:middle line:84%
And then what
happens, they believe,

00:53:18.350 --> 00:53:22.670 align:middle line:84%
is that the polarity at
that point just reverses.

00:53:22.670 --> 00:53:25.540 align:middle line:84%
And what happens is
it explodes again,

00:53:25.540 --> 00:53:28.040 align:middle line:84%
not explodes from
the middle out.

00:53:28.040 --> 00:53:30.190 align:middle line:84%
Every single,
ultimately, [INAUDIBLE]

00:53:30.190 --> 00:53:32.240 align:middle line:84%
of matter in the entire
physical universe

00:53:32.240 --> 00:53:35.030 align:middle line:90%
repels every other one.

00:53:35.030 --> 00:53:37.220 align:middle line:84%
And it generates
another big bang.

00:53:37.220 --> 00:53:39.260 align:middle line:84%
And so you get this big
bang that occurs again,

00:53:39.260 --> 00:53:42.650 align:middle line:84%
and it starts to expand out and
create galaxies and universes

00:53:42.650 --> 00:53:45.440 align:middle line:84%
and living entities and
conscious beings that

00:53:45.440 --> 00:53:46.880 align:middle line:90%
relate to the universe.

00:53:46.880 --> 00:53:48.800 align:middle line:90%
And it goes again.

00:53:48.800 --> 00:53:51.410 align:middle line:84%
This is what they call
the oscillating cosmos.

00:53:51.410 --> 00:53:53.720 align:middle line:84%
This is what they call
the [SPEAKING LATIN],,

00:53:53.720 --> 00:53:58.100 align:middle line:84%
the grand year of the
reactionary worldview.

00:53:58.100 --> 00:54:01.250 align:middle line:84%
And it repeats over and
over and over again.

00:54:01.250 --> 00:54:04.010 align:middle line:84%
And they believe that
it's all very mechanical.

00:54:04.010 --> 00:54:07.470 align:middle line:84%
It's just kind of predestined
to kind of go like that.

00:54:07.470 --> 00:54:09.290 align:middle line:84%
And what they
think, therefore, is

00:54:09.290 --> 00:54:11.230 align:middle line:84%
that their mode of
ethical reasoning

00:54:11.230 --> 00:54:14.120 align:middle line:84%
is that it's not like the
mode of ethical reasoning

00:54:14.120 --> 00:54:17.000 align:middle line:84%
of the right systematists
that everything is chaos

00:54:17.000 --> 00:54:20.300 align:middle line:84%
and you have to just assert
your power and control

00:54:20.300 --> 00:54:22.970 align:middle line:84%
and get control of an
otherwise chaotic universe

00:54:22.970 --> 00:54:24.500 align:middle line:90%
and impose your will on it.

00:54:24.500 --> 00:54:27.680 align:middle line:84%
What the reactionary believe
is that what you have to do

00:54:27.680 --> 00:54:31.480 align:middle line:84%
is you have to get on one side
or another of a dialectic,

00:54:31.480 --> 00:54:33.500 align:middle line:84%
because that they
can tell is going on.

00:54:33.500 --> 00:54:35.930 align:middle line:84%
There's this dialectical
process going on--

00:54:35.930 --> 00:54:37.940 align:middle line:90%
expanding and contracting.

00:54:37.940 --> 00:54:40.220 align:middle line:84%
And so therefore their
mode of ethical reasoning

00:54:40.220 --> 00:54:43.250 align:middle line:84%
is get on one side of
a dialectic or another,

00:54:43.250 --> 00:54:47.270 align:middle line:84%
and thereby lend
meaning to your life.

00:54:47.270 --> 00:54:48.410 align:middle line:90%
It's yin and yang.

00:54:48.410 --> 00:54:49.640 align:middle line:90%
And it's black and white.

00:54:49.640 --> 00:54:50.640 align:middle line:90%
It's good guys.

00:54:50.640 --> 00:54:51.440 align:middle line:90%
It's bad guys.

00:54:51.440 --> 00:54:52.240 align:middle line:90%
It's red team.

00:54:52.240 --> 00:54:53.720 align:middle line:90%
It's blue team.

00:54:53.720 --> 00:54:55.520 align:middle line:90%
It's Republicans.

00:54:55.520 --> 00:54:56.500 align:middle line:90%
It's Democrats.

00:54:56.500 --> 00:55:02.000 align:middle line:84%
And what we see is our culture
in Western civilization

00:55:02.000 --> 00:55:08.240 align:middle line:84%
is very much attached to this
reactionary paradigm right now.

00:55:08.240 --> 00:55:11.930 align:middle line:84%
Everybody goes crazy over
San Francisco 49ers playing

00:55:11.930 --> 00:55:14.030 align:middle line:84%
the Kansas City
Chiefs, or the New York

00:55:14.030 --> 00:55:19.270 align:middle line:84%
Yankees playing the Boston
Red Sox, or the Oakland--

00:55:19.270 --> 00:55:23.720 align:middle line:84%
the Golden State Warriors
playing the Bucks or something.

00:55:23.720 --> 00:55:26.170 align:middle line:90%
And they just train you to it.

00:55:26.170 --> 00:55:29.030 align:middle line:84%
They bring people up
their entire lives

00:55:29.030 --> 00:55:31.180 align:middle line:90%
dedicated to this dialectic.

00:55:31.180 --> 00:55:34.220 align:middle line:84%
And the people people who
can't find any other meaning

00:55:34.220 --> 00:55:37.670 align:middle line:84%
in their lives go
crazy in the stands.

00:55:37.670 --> 00:55:39.615 align:middle line:84%
And they put big
spikes on their head.

00:55:39.615 --> 00:55:41.240 align:middle line:84%
And they wear all
these crazy costumes.

00:55:41.240 --> 00:55:44.360 align:middle line:84%
And they drink and
get totally crocked

00:55:44.360 --> 00:55:46.310 align:middle line:90%
and they eat meat like mad.

00:55:46.310 --> 00:55:48.340 align:middle line:90%
And they go and fight.

00:55:48.340 --> 00:55:49.920 align:middle line:90%
I'm telling you.

00:55:49.920 --> 00:55:54.720 align:middle line:84%
What I'm saying is that
this reactionary paradigm,

00:55:54.720 --> 00:55:57.380 align:middle line:84%
this dialectical paradigm
is extraordinarily

00:55:57.380 --> 00:56:00.230 align:middle line:84%
strong in that
they unconsciously

00:56:00.230 --> 00:56:02.350 align:middle line:84%
believe in the
oscillating cosmos,

00:56:02.350 --> 00:56:04.550 align:middle line:84%
and that there's
no meaning to life

00:56:04.550 --> 00:56:07.280 align:middle line:84%
at all unless you're
on one side or another

00:56:07.280 --> 00:56:09.230 align:middle line:90%
of a fundamental dialectic.

00:56:09.230 --> 00:56:12.510 align:middle line:84%
And that's how you derive all
of your meaning out of life.

00:56:12.510 --> 00:56:14.060 align:middle line:90%
Of course, this is Hagel.

00:56:14.060 --> 00:56:16.970 align:middle line:84%
Hagel is the philosopher
of the second paradigm,

00:56:16.970 --> 00:56:20.780 align:middle line:84%
the dialectical materialism
that you hear about.

00:56:20.780 --> 00:56:23.390 align:middle line:84%
Now, what are the
other views of this?

00:56:23.390 --> 00:56:28.610 align:middle line:10%
You go over to the-- all the way
over to the seventh paradigm,

00:56:28.610 --> 00:56:33.450 align:middle line:10%
in this case, the left
systematists worldview.

00:56:33.450 --> 00:56:37.660 align:middle line:10%
And what they believe is
that there is an infinite,

00:56:37.660 --> 00:56:45.620 align:middle line:10%
and in finite, an eternal sea
of absolutely undifferentiated

00:56:45.620 --> 00:56:51.210 align:middle line:10%
consciousness that abides.

00:56:51.210 --> 00:56:53.940 align:middle line:84%
And there is this
event that takes

00:56:53.940 --> 00:56:56.520 align:middle line:84%
place that is in
fact taking place

00:56:56.520 --> 00:57:01.380 align:middle line:84%
at every single microsecond,
because time doesn't exist

00:57:01.380 --> 00:57:07.440 align:middle line:84%
in that field of the
setting up of a perturbance

00:57:07.440 --> 00:57:12.150 align:middle line:84%
inside the otherwise completely
undifferentiated field

00:57:12.150 --> 00:57:13.290 align:middle line:90%
of consciousness.

00:57:13.290 --> 00:57:16.930 align:middle line:90%
A differentiation occurs.

00:57:16.930 --> 00:57:22.640 align:middle line:84%
And so what happens is that
this differentiation sets up

00:57:22.640 --> 00:57:27.270 align:middle line:84%
a polar event in
that there's a desire

00:57:27.270 --> 00:57:31.480 align:middle line:84%
to get back to a completely
unified consciousness.

00:57:31.480 --> 00:57:34.920 align:middle line:84%
And so there's a reaching out of
one end of this differentiation

00:57:34.920 --> 00:57:39.300 align:middle line:84%
to the other, which generates
the original wave of energy

00:57:39.300 --> 00:57:40.980 align:middle line:90%
in the universe.

00:57:40.980 --> 00:57:43.340 align:middle line:84%
And then it comes
back together again

00:57:43.340 --> 00:57:46.080 align:middle line:84%
and manifests as a
potential Higgs boson,

00:57:46.080 --> 00:57:48.210 align:middle line:90%
an actual particle of mass.

00:57:48.210 --> 00:57:50.130 align:middle line:84%
And this process
starts to go on.

00:57:50.130 --> 00:57:54.142 align:middle line:84%
And there's this kind of
mitosis that takes place.

00:57:54.142 --> 00:57:56.100 align:middle line:84%
And it just keeps on
going and going and going.

00:57:56.100 --> 00:58:00.690 align:middle line:84%
And it actually generates
the material universe.

00:58:00.690 --> 00:58:03.270 align:middle line:84%
But it's important to
remember, the universe,

00:58:03.270 --> 00:58:07.960 align:middle line:84%
all of these material entities
is made up of consciousness.

00:58:07.960 --> 00:58:12.213 align:middle line:84%
It's just a condensation of
consciousness in the universe.

00:58:12.213 --> 00:58:13.630 align:middle line:84%
And so therefore
it's not a matter

00:58:13.630 --> 00:58:15.280 align:middle line:84%
of there being a
consciousness that

00:58:15.280 --> 00:58:18.370 align:middle line:84%
exists just outside of
the parameters of the sum

00:58:18.370 --> 00:58:21.280 align:middle line:84%
total of mass and
energy in the universe.

00:58:21.280 --> 00:58:24.850 align:middle line:84%
The universe itself is
pervaded with consciousness,

00:58:24.850 --> 00:58:28.120 align:middle line:84%
that every single
inchoate quantum

00:58:28.120 --> 00:58:32.030 align:middle line:84%
field in the entire universe
is, in fact, conscious.

00:58:32.030 --> 00:58:35.650 align:middle line:84%
And the you start putting more
and more of them together.

00:58:35.650 --> 00:58:38.170 align:middle line:84%
And they actually-- this
is an ontological issue--

00:58:38.170 --> 00:58:41.147 align:middle line:84%
is that somehow a certain
number of them come together,

00:58:41.147 --> 00:58:42.730 align:middle line:84%
and what they do is
they end up having

00:58:42.730 --> 00:58:44.890 align:middle line:90%
a collective consciousness.

00:58:44.890 --> 00:58:47.260 align:middle line:84%
And they actually view--
they experience themselves

00:58:47.260 --> 00:58:49.660 align:middle line:84%
as having a consciousness
that incorporates

00:58:49.660 --> 00:58:52.780 align:middle line:84%
a whole bunch of these
inchoate quantum fields.

00:58:52.780 --> 00:58:55.390 align:middle line:84%
And then you get these little
single organisms, living

00:58:55.390 --> 00:58:56.980 align:middle line:90%
organisms, that are conscious.

00:58:56.980 --> 00:58:59.440 align:middle line:84%
And they actually
can decide to kind

00:58:59.440 --> 00:59:02.110 align:middle line:84%
of move around in
the ocean and stuff.

00:59:02.110 --> 00:59:04.520 align:middle line:84%
And they could-- and they
get more and more complex.

00:59:04.520 --> 00:59:06.970 align:middle line:84%
This what take Teilhard de
Chardin talks about at length

00:59:06.970 --> 00:59:11.530 align:middle line:84%
is the complexification of life
as it evolves teleologically up

00:59:11.530 --> 00:59:13.720 align:middle line:84%
into higher and higher
forms, and that there's

00:59:13.720 --> 00:59:15.400 align:middle line:84%
this whole process
that's going on.

00:59:15.400 --> 00:59:19.240 align:middle line:84%
And so therefore, this
left systematist worldview

00:59:19.240 --> 00:59:24.040 align:middle line:84%
is almost the classic
theological worldview,

00:59:24.040 --> 00:59:26.860 align:middle line:84%
because in attempting
to communicate

00:59:26.860 --> 00:59:29.470 align:middle line:84%
this extraordinarily
sophisticated understanding

00:59:29.470 --> 00:59:31.480 align:middle line:84%
to people at a time
in the Middle Ages

00:59:31.480 --> 00:59:34.705 align:middle line:84%
when 99% of the people
were completely illiterate.

00:59:34.705 --> 00:59:39.010 align:middle line:84%
They couldn't read, never saw
anything, a book of any kind,

00:59:39.010 --> 00:59:41.440 align:middle line:84%
and never even moved
more than 50 miles

00:59:41.440 --> 00:59:44.140 align:middle line:84%
away from the spot
that they were born.

00:59:44.140 --> 00:59:46.270 align:middle line:84%
And so the effort to
try to communicate

00:59:46.270 --> 00:59:49.720 align:middle line:84%
this kind of extraordinarily
subtle insight

00:59:49.720 --> 00:59:52.420 align:middle line:84%
into the ultimate
nature of reality

00:59:52.420 --> 00:59:57.460 align:middle line:84%
started anthropomorphizing
the infinite and eternal.

00:59:57.460 --> 00:59:59.860 align:middle line:84%
But at the same time, the
mystics in that whole realm

00:59:59.860 --> 01:00:03.490 align:middle line:84%
would keep saying, you
cannot now nounify--

01:00:03.490 --> 01:00:07.130 align:middle line:84%
you cannot nounify the
infinite and eternal.

01:00:07.130 --> 01:00:12.460 align:middle line:84%
It is heresy if you try
to give a name to this

01:00:12.460 --> 01:00:17.320 align:middle line:84%
and nounify it, you are
ruined, because you've

01:00:17.320 --> 01:00:20.530 align:middle line:84%
completely misunderstood
what the reality is here,

01:00:20.530 --> 01:00:22.790 align:middle line:90%
because it is not a noun.

01:00:22.790 --> 01:00:24.490 align:middle line:90%
It's a verb.

01:00:24.490 --> 01:00:29.430 align:middle line:84%
And in fact, it's a
non-transitive verb of being.

01:00:29.430 --> 01:00:30.230 align:middle line:90%
All right?

01:00:30.230 --> 01:00:31.590 align:middle line:90%
And there is a--

01:00:31.590 --> 01:00:33.340 align:middle line:84%
you can't even
think of it in terms

01:00:33.340 --> 01:00:39.010 align:middle line:84%
of there being a relationship
between it and us.

01:00:39.010 --> 01:00:41.320 align:middle line:90%
Us is it.

01:00:41.320 --> 01:00:44.940 align:middle line:90%
We am it, you know?

01:00:44.940 --> 01:00:47.340 align:middle line:90%
And I am that I am.

01:00:47.340 --> 01:00:48.780 align:middle line:90%
That that's what this is.

01:00:48.780 --> 01:00:51.820 align:middle line:84%
So you get this
completely different

01:00:51.820 --> 01:00:56.170 align:middle line:84%
cosmological assumption
about how the universe came

01:00:56.170 --> 01:00:59.350 align:middle line:84%
into being and
how it's unfolding

01:00:59.350 --> 01:01:02.860 align:middle line:84%
and toward what
ends it's unfolding.

01:01:02.860 --> 01:01:06.280 align:middle line:84%
And so you begin to see
these different cosmological

01:01:06.280 --> 01:01:09.430 align:middle line:84%
assumptions and different
teleological assumptions

01:01:09.430 --> 01:01:13.600 align:middle line:84%
generate an entirely different
mode of ethical reasoning.

01:01:13.600 --> 01:01:16.150 align:middle line:84%
And so the reason that
I raise all of this

01:01:16.150 --> 01:01:18.700 align:middle line:84%
is so that you'll be
familiar with the fact

01:01:18.700 --> 01:01:23.290 align:middle line:84%
when I tell you
that the adherents

01:01:23.290 --> 01:01:28.240 align:middle line:84%
to these different worldviews
have a very different idea

01:01:28.240 --> 01:01:31.910 align:middle line:90%
about global climate change.

01:01:31.910 --> 01:01:35.818 align:middle line:84%
The authoritarians, they view
the scientific information

01:01:35.818 --> 01:01:37.360 align:middle line:84%
about the existence
of global climate

01:01:37.360 --> 01:01:40.570 align:middle line:90%
change as an inherent threat.

01:01:40.570 --> 01:01:42.620 align:middle line:90%
It's a threat to their control.

01:01:42.620 --> 01:01:45.830 align:middle line:84%
It's a threat to their
continued domination and control

01:01:45.830 --> 01:01:50.650 align:middle line:84%
of the world through their
ownership of oil and gas

01:01:50.650 --> 01:01:53.890 align:middle line:84%
and coal and the military
instrumentalities that

01:01:53.890 --> 01:01:58.870 align:middle line:84%
run off fossil fuels that they
use to dominate the world.

01:01:58.870 --> 01:02:04.060 align:middle line:84%
And they've created this idea
of money, which they created.

01:02:04.060 --> 01:02:07.330 align:middle line:84%
And they try to pretend they
created it for our benefit,

01:02:07.330 --> 01:02:08.820 align:middle line:84%
because it's easier
than carrying

01:02:08.820 --> 01:02:11.870 align:middle line:84%
around bushels of wheat and
apples to exchange and barter.

01:02:11.870 --> 01:02:12.670 align:middle line:90%
But it's not.

01:02:12.670 --> 01:02:15.520 align:middle line:84%
They created it, so
they control it, right?

01:02:15.520 --> 01:02:17.680 align:middle line:90%
And they manipulate it.

01:02:17.680 --> 01:02:20.420 align:middle line:84%
And they become super
multimillionaires

01:02:20.420 --> 01:02:23.750 align:middle line:84%
by doing it and
lending the money.

01:02:23.750 --> 01:02:28.090 align:middle line:84%
And so the whole idea
of global climate change

01:02:28.090 --> 01:02:32.380 align:middle line:84%
coming on and threatening
the continued utilization

01:02:32.380 --> 01:02:34.420 align:middle line:84%
of fossil fuels
on which they have

01:02:34.420 --> 01:02:38.080 align:middle line:84%
cast their lot for
controlling the world

01:02:38.080 --> 01:02:42.760 align:middle line:84%
is experienced as another
threat, another type of chaos.

01:02:42.760 --> 01:02:44.980 align:middle line:84%
And so what they do
is they react to it.

01:02:44.980 --> 01:02:50.250 align:middle line:84%
And they try to crush the
people that are involved in it.

01:02:50.250 --> 01:02:53.170 align:middle line:84%
The reactionaries,
the reactionaries,

01:02:53.170 --> 01:02:55.540 align:middle line:84%
what they believe, you
know what they believe.

01:02:55.540 --> 01:03:00.610 align:middle line:84%
They believe that, well,
it's a hoax by China,

01:03:00.610 --> 01:03:05.200 align:middle line:84%
that our adversary, our ultimate
other, our dialectic opponent

01:03:05.200 --> 01:03:07.380 align:middle line:84%
is faking all this,
because they're

01:03:07.380 --> 01:03:11.940 align:middle line:84%
trying to undermine our basic
industrial base in the world.

01:03:11.940 --> 01:03:15.820 align:middle line:84%
And so they just say that it's
a hoax perpetrated by China.

01:03:15.820 --> 01:03:16.620 align:middle line:90%
All right?

01:03:16.620 --> 01:03:23.670 align:middle line:84%
And so then the conservatives,
they keep arguing that,

01:03:23.670 --> 01:03:27.300 align:middle line:84%
well, maybe it's just part
of the natural cycle, right?

01:03:27.300 --> 01:03:28.390 align:middle line:90%
They love this one.

01:03:28.390 --> 01:03:29.890 align:middle line:84%
It's just part of
the natural cycle.

01:03:29.890 --> 01:03:32.490 align:middle line:84%
Oh, there were ice ages,
and there were ice fields.

01:03:32.490 --> 01:03:34.350 align:middle line:84%
And now they're just
kind of melting,

01:03:34.350 --> 01:03:37.040 align:middle line:84%
and we're going back
to a different stage.

01:03:37.040 --> 01:03:41.190 align:middle line:84%
So they have a very conservative
attitude about the whole thing.

01:03:41.190 --> 01:03:44.340 align:middle line:84%
And the moderates,
who are basically

01:03:44.340 --> 01:03:46.740 align:middle line:84%
agnostic about the
whole thing, they just

01:03:46.740 --> 01:03:49.560 align:middle line:84%
advise that we take
incremental steps.

01:03:49.560 --> 01:03:51.510 align:middle line:84%
Let's try to do something
about cutting back

01:03:51.510 --> 01:03:54.540 align:middle line:84%
on the amount of fossil
fuel that we use, but let's

01:03:54.540 --> 01:03:57.360 align:middle line:84%
make sure that the people
who own all the fossil fuels

01:03:57.360 --> 01:03:59.730 align:middle line:84%
can own the alternative
sources of energy

01:03:59.730 --> 01:04:03.870 align:middle line:84%
as well so that BP can move
into creating alternative energy

01:04:03.870 --> 01:04:06.840 align:middle line:84%
and doing windmills
and generating

01:04:06.840 --> 01:04:08.310 align:middle line:90%
solar panels and stuff.

01:04:08.310 --> 01:04:10.120 align:middle line:84%
As long as we take
it nice and slowly,

01:04:10.120 --> 01:04:12.750 align:middle line:84%
we can convert all
the way into this.

01:04:12.750 --> 01:04:15.420 align:middle line:84%
I mean, that's the moderate's
way of dealing with it.

01:04:15.420 --> 01:04:18.150 align:middle line:84%
The liberals,
classic like Obama.

01:04:18.150 --> 01:04:19.980 align:middle line:84%
Obama says, look,
we're confronted

01:04:19.980 --> 01:04:23.760 align:middle line:84%
by the scientists saying
that unless we reduce

01:04:23.760 --> 01:04:28.200 align:middle line:84%
the annual amount of global
greenhouse gas emissions

01:04:28.200 --> 01:04:36.720 align:middle line:84%
by 70% by 2030, we're completely
wedded to total catastrophe.

01:04:36.720 --> 01:04:39.060 align:middle line:90%
By 70%.

01:04:39.060 --> 01:04:44.760 align:middle line:84%
And so the Obama administration
proposes, how about 33%?

01:04:44.760 --> 01:04:46.050 align:middle line:90%
How about 33%?

01:04:46.050 --> 01:04:47.640 align:middle line:84%
That'll work,
because we might be

01:04:47.640 --> 01:04:50.580 align:middle line:84%
able to get away with
that one and maintain

01:04:50.580 --> 01:04:53.880 align:middle line:84%
the funding the Democratic
Party gets from the oil and gas

01:04:53.880 --> 01:04:58.380 align:middle line:84%
corporations and the insurance
companies and big pharma.

01:04:58.380 --> 01:05:00.360 align:middle line:90%
Let's just take it a little--

01:05:00.360 --> 01:05:03.420 align:middle line:84%
it's like saying someone
is getting set to be killed

01:05:03.420 --> 01:05:05.660 align:middle line:90%
in an hour 100 miles away.

01:05:05.660 --> 01:05:09.450 align:middle line:84%
And so let's drive our car 50
miles an hour to get there.

01:05:09.450 --> 01:05:11.310 align:middle line:90%
That isn't going to happen.

01:05:11.310 --> 01:05:12.610 align:middle line:90%
And they know it.

01:05:12.610 --> 01:05:15.210 align:middle line:84%
And yet, they are so
hooked into the liberal--

01:05:15.210 --> 01:05:17.490 align:middle line:84%
the classic liberals,
the liberals

01:05:17.490 --> 01:05:19.500 align:middle line:84%
believe that they
have to stay wedded

01:05:19.500 --> 01:05:23.880 align:middle line:84%
to the transnational, corporate,
capitalist, economic system

01:05:23.880 --> 01:05:26.970 align:middle line:84%
as the major mechanism for
developing and distributing

01:05:26.970 --> 01:05:29.252 align:middle line:84%
the major resources
in the world.

01:05:29.252 --> 01:05:31.710 align:middle line:84%
And there are certain people
that benefit from that system.

01:05:31.710 --> 01:05:34.043 align:middle line:84%
And there are others who gain
some trickle-down benefits

01:05:34.043 --> 01:05:35.200 align:middle line:90%
from it, et cetera.

01:05:35.200 --> 01:05:38.700 align:middle line:84%
And the liberals are perfectly
willing to go along with that.

01:05:38.700 --> 01:05:40.290 align:middle line:10%
And so you see
this happening now

01:05:40.290 --> 01:05:43.260 align:middle line:10%
that the structures, the
Democratic and Republican

01:05:43.260 --> 01:05:45.190 align:middle line:10%
structures, what's
happened is when

01:05:45.190 --> 01:05:47.010 align:middle line:10%
we got to the end
of the Cold War

01:05:47.010 --> 01:05:48.750 align:middle line:10%
with the dissolution
of the Soviet Union

01:05:48.750 --> 01:05:52.110 align:middle line:10%
on December 31 of
1991, what happened

01:05:52.110 --> 01:05:55.560 align:middle line:10%
is the robber
barons that had been

01:05:55.560 --> 01:05:57.540 align:middle line:10%
in power from the
end of the Civil War,

01:05:57.540 --> 01:06:00.990 align:middle line:10%
1868, all the way to 1898,
the whole robber baron

01:06:00.990 --> 01:06:05.090 align:middle line:10%
era, which even high schools
teach as the age of imperialism

01:06:05.090 --> 01:06:07.260 align:middle line:10%
and the age of
the robber barons,

01:06:07.260 --> 01:06:09.000 align:middle line:10%
and go on and on and
on about how they

01:06:09.000 --> 01:06:11.160 align:middle line:10%
had all these mills
where people were

01:06:11.160 --> 01:06:13.890 align:middle line:10%
being chained to the machines
to work 12 hour days.

01:06:13.890 --> 01:06:16.110 align:middle line:84%
And the women that were
in the sewing factories,

01:06:16.110 --> 01:06:18.390 align:middle line:84%
they couldn't go to the
bathroom more than once a day.

01:06:18.390 --> 01:06:19.680 align:middle line:90%
All that kind of stuff.

01:06:19.680 --> 01:06:25.740 align:middle line:84%
That was in full flower up until
the end of the First World War

01:06:25.740 --> 01:06:28.950 align:middle line:84%
when the Soviet Union--
when the Bolsheviks rose up

01:06:28.950 --> 01:06:31.740 align:middle line:84%
in October of 1917
and established

01:06:31.740 --> 01:06:35.490 align:middle line:84%
a worldwide socialist
revolution to try

01:06:35.490 --> 01:06:38.520 align:middle line:84%
to confront the imperialists
and the capitalists that

01:06:38.520 --> 01:06:41.280 align:middle line:84%
were trying to take
over the whole world

01:06:41.280 --> 01:06:43.380 align:middle line:90%
for their corporations.

01:06:43.380 --> 01:06:44.370 align:middle line:90%
Perfectly obvious.

01:06:44.370 --> 01:06:46.590 align:middle line:84%
They were very clear about
what they were doing.

01:06:46.590 --> 01:06:49.650 align:middle line:84%
Mark Hanna, who was the major
political advisor for McKinley

01:06:49.650 --> 01:06:52.350 align:middle line:84%
in the 1898 election,
they asked him,

01:06:52.350 --> 01:06:54.660 align:middle line:84%
what would you
advise a young boy?

01:06:54.660 --> 01:06:56.700 align:middle line:84%
You know, ignoring all
the women, of course.

01:06:56.700 --> 01:07:00.720 align:middle line:84%
What would you advise a
young boy to do in life?

01:07:00.720 --> 01:07:02.880 align:middle line:84%
I suggest he make as
much money as he possibly

01:07:02.880 --> 01:07:04.980 align:middle line:90%
can before he dies.

01:07:04.980 --> 01:07:06.280 align:middle line:90%
Well, there's a great thing.

01:07:06.280 --> 01:07:08.490 align:middle line:90%
There's a big life view.

01:07:08.490 --> 01:07:09.930 align:middle line:90%
But that's the way they were.

01:07:09.930 --> 01:07:12.540 align:middle line:84%
And so what happened is that
when the socialist revolution

01:07:12.540 --> 01:07:15.325 align:middle line:84%
came on, and it got totally
sideswiped by Stalin

01:07:15.325 --> 01:07:17.700 align:middle line:84%
and taken over and turned into
an authoritarian communist

01:07:17.700 --> 01:07:18.500 align:middle line:90%
regime.

01:07:18.500 --> 01:07:19.920 align:middle line:90%
It was total crap.

01:07:19.920 --> 01:07:24.480 align:middle line:84%
But the bottom line is that as
soon as Gorbachev stepped out

01:07:24.480 --> 01:07:29.310 align:middle line:84%
of this dialectic that had
been going on for 75 years,

01:07:29.310 --> 01:07:31.380 align:middle line:84%
as soon as they
stepped out of that,

01:07:31.380 --> 01:07:36.010 align:middle line:84%
the robber barons just came
rushing back in full flower,

01:07:36.010 --> 01:07:37.500 align:middle line:90%
and said, let's get back to it.

01:07:37.500 --> 01:07:39.300 align:middle line:84%
There's been this
hiatus in our ability

01:07:39.300 --> 01:07:40.800 align:middle line:84%
to kind of take
over the whole world

01:07:40.800 --> 01:07:44.640 align:middle line:84%
and run it according
to our best interests.

01:07:44.640 --> 01:07:47.280 align:middle line:84%
What it means is
we have to infuse

01:07:47.280 --> 01:07:51.450 align:middle line:84%
this discussion about
global climate change

01:07:51.450 --> 01:07:56.040 align:middle line:84%
with a spiritual message,
that this isn't just

01:07:56.040 --> 01:07:59.400 align:middle line:84%
a political confrontation
between authoritarian

01:07:59.400 --> 01:08:02.670 align:middle line:90%
capitalism and socialism.

01:08:02.670 --> 01:08:04.260 align:middle line:90%
It cannot be that.

01:08:04.260 --> 01:08:09.660 align:middle line:84%
If they're both just completely
secular, non-spiritual combat,

01:08:09.660 --> 01:08:12.190 align:middle line:84%
this is going to be
mayhem for our country.

01:08:12.190 --> 01:08:15.060 align:middle line:84%
What we have to do is
infuse the entire movement

01:08:15.060 --> 01:08:17.370 align:middle line:84%
to stop global
climate change with

01:08:17.370 --> 01:08:19.260 align:middle line:90%
a genuine spiritual vision.

01:08:19.260 --> 01:08:22.410 align:middle line:84%
So the question that arises
is, what spiritual vision

01:08:22.410 --> 01:08:24.580 align:middle line:90%
is that going to be?

01:08:24.580 --> 01:08:27.540 align:middle line:84%
And I'm suggesting that we
have to be extremely careful.

01:08:27.540 --> 01:08:31.470 align:middle line:84%
You cannot go to just the
left systematist theological

01:08:31.470 --> 01:08:32.580 align:middle line:90%
worldview.

01:08:32.580 --> 01:08:36.399 align:middle line:84%
And moreover, it's prohibited
by the First Amendment.

01:08:36.399 --> 01:08:39.850 align:middle line:84%
You cannot have the state,
like our office is drafting

01:08:39.850 --> 01:08:42.880 align:middle line:90%
the California Green New Deal.

01:08:42.880 --> 01:08:45.310 align:middle line:84%
The Democratic central
committee, as you know,

01:08:45.310 --> 01:08:48.760 align:middle line:84%
the Democratic Party has 2/3
of the members of the state

01:08:48.760 --> 01:08:51.550 align:middle line:84%
assembly and 2/3 of
the state senate.

01:08:51.550 --> 01:08:53.770 align:middle line:84%
So I have super
majorities in both Houses.

01:08:53.770 --> 01:08:55.569 align:middle line:84%
We have the best chance
here in California

01:08:55.569 --> 01:08:57.850 align:middle line:84%
to get a genuine
Green New Deal passed.

01:08:57.850 --> 01:09:06.640 align:middle line:84%
So while Alexandria
Ocasio-Cortez and Ed Markey

01:09:06.640 --> 01:09:10.840 align:middle line:84%
have put in a
nine-page bill, HR 109,

01:09:10.840 --> 01:09:13.600 align:middle line:84%
in the House of
Representatives and others

01:09:13.600 --> 01:09:16.920 align:middle line:84%
have put in similar four-
or five-page proposals,

01:09:16.920 --> 01:09:23.770 align:middle line:84%
we have actually
a 50-page outline

01:09:23.770 --> 01:09:26.210 align:middle line:90%
of the bill somewhere here.

01:09:26.210 --> 01:09:27.010 align:middle line:90%
Here it is.

01:09:27.010 --> 01:09:29.620 align:middle line:90%


01:09:29.620 --> 01:09:33.490 align:middle line:84%
Our office has put together
a 50-page outline, which

01:09:33.490 --> 01:09:37.060 align:middle line:90%
I have completely mislaid.

01:09:37.060 --> 01:09:43.300 align:middle line:84%
But we actually have a 350-page
draft of the bill in details.

01:09:43.300 --> 01:09:48.100 align:middle line:84%
And it covers 13 different
sectors, from transportation

01:09:48.100 --> 01:09:52.720 align:middle line:84%
to waste water to agriculture
to electricity, generating

01:09:52.720 --> 01:09:54.229 align:middle line:90%
electricity, et cetera.

01:09:54.229 --> 01:09:57.280 align:middle line:84%
This is not just a whole
bunch of abstract principles.

01:09:57.280 --> 01:10:01.240 align:middle line:84%
It's a very concrete program
as to how you get there.

01:10:01.240 --> 01:10:05.680 align:middle line:84%
But again, this has
to be advocated from

01:10:05.680 --> 01:10:09.190 align:middle line:84%
a non-theological point of
view, because if you're going

01:10:09.190 --> 01:10:11.697 align:middle line:84%
to exercise power on
behalf of the state,

01:10:11.697 --> 01:10:13.780 align:middle line:84%
whether it's the state of
California and the state

01:10:13.780 --> 01:10:15.670 align:middle line:84%
legislature and the
governor's office,

01:10:15.670 --> 01:10:18.380 align:middle line:90%
or whether it ends up being--

01:10:18.380 --> 01:10:19.190 align:middle line:90%
here it is.

01:10:19.190 --> 01:10:20.148 align:middle line:90%
Here's my little thing.

01:10:20.148 --> 01:10:24.070 align:middle line:84%
So here's our 50-page
outline of the whole thing

01:10:24.070 --> 01:10:27.850 align:middle line:84%
with the 13 different areas
of water and waste management

01:10:27.850 --> 01:10:31.180 align:middle line:84%
and electrical energy and
agriculture, forest management,

01:10:31.180 --> 01:10:33.220 align:middle line:84%
and forest fire
management education.

01:10:33.220 --> 01:10:36.340 align:middle line:84%
The Green Workforce, to
have like a Green New Deal

01:10:36.340 --> 01:10:40.210 align:middle line:84%
to employ the people that move
from the other industries.

01:10:40.210 --> 01:10:45.220 align:middle line:84%
We've got this working right
now, but what we have to do

01:10:45.220 --> 01:10:48.400 align:middle line:84%
is we have to field
a group of people

01:10:48.400 --> 01:10:52.030 align:middle line:84%
who are going to be espousing
the enactment of this

01:10:52.030 --> 01:10:54.880 align:middle line:84%
not for simply just
political reasons,

01:10:54.880 --> 01:10:58.270 align:middle line:84%
but for genuine
spiritual reasons.

01:10:58.270 --> 01:11:00.310 align:middle line:90%
And it is the sixth paradigm.

01:11:00.310 --> 01:11:02.710 align:middle line:84%
It's this new quantum
paradigm that's

01:11:02.710 --> 01:11:05.320 align:middle line:84%
just right at the edge of
sort of coming into being.

01:11:05.320 --> 01:11:08.710 align:middle line:84%
It's the new paradigm that
the entire kind of new age

01:11:08.710 --> 01:11:09.850 align:middle line:90%
community is talking about.

01:11:09.850 --> 01:11:11.650 align:middle line:84%
They're talking about it
at the California Institute

01:11:11.650 --> 01:11:12.738 align:middle line:90%
for Integral Studies.

01:11:12.738 --> 01:11:13.780 align:middle line:90%
They're talking about it.

01:11:13.780 --> 01:11:16.240 align:middle line:84%
IONS, the Institute
of Noetic Science.

01:11:16.240 --> 01:11:17.890 align:middle line:84%
They're all-- I
don't know what it

01:11:17.890 --> 01:11:19.990 align:middle line:84%
is they're all being so
shy about, but I mean,

01:11:19.990 --> 01:11:22.310 align:middle line:84%
it's a classic radical
monist worldview.

01:11:22.310 --> 01:11:26.170 align:middle line:84%
It's the sixth paradigm
quantum worldview,

01:11:26.170 --> 01:11:30.910 align:middle line:84%
realizing that the plenum, that
the fields of inchoate quantum

01:11:30.910 --> 01:11:34.810 align:middle line:84%
fields that are blinking on
and off every microsecond

01:11:34.810 --> 01:11:37.600 align:middle line:84%
can actually be
influenced by directed

01:11:37.600 --> 01:11:39.520 align:middle line:90%
intention of our human family.

01:11:39.520 --> 01:11:42.850 align:middle line:84%
And we can actually manifest
the next microsecond of reality

01:11:42.850 --> 01:11:46.900 align:middle line:84%
consistent with our intention,
fueled by love and affection,

01:11:46.900 --> 01:11:50.110 align:middle line:84%
in an experiential
sense of oneness.

01:11:50.110 --> 01:11:52.870 align:middle line:84%
We represent the Lakota
people, as you know, up

01:11:52.870 --> 01:11:54.130 align:middle line:90%
in North Dakota.

01:11:54.130 --> 01:11:56.150 align:middle line:90%
And you talk to the shamans.

01:11:56.150 --> 01:11:59.500 align:middle line:84%
And they'll say, Christians,
you guys are really funny.

01:11:59.500 --> 01:12:01.910 align:middle line:90%
You guys pray for rain.

01:12:01.910 --> 01:12:04.000 align:middle line:90%
And it doesn't rain.

01:12:04.000 --> 01:12:07.670 align:middle line:84%
What you have to do is
you have to be the rain.

01:12:07.670 --> 01:12:10.140 align:middle line:90%
You have to be the rain.

01:12:10.140 --> 01:12:12.780 align:middle line:90%
And the rain rains.

01:12:12.780 --> 01:12:14.730 align:middle line:84%
And if you don't
understand that,

01:12:14.730 --> 01:12:17.280 align:middle line:84%
you don't understand
the new paradigm.

01:12:17.280 --> 01:12:20.430 align:middle line:84%
There's no dialectical
relationship

01:12:20.430 --> 01:12:22.100 align:middle line:84%
between the infinite
and eternal.

01:12:22.100 --> 01:12:24.360 align:middle line:90%
This is an organic thing.

01:12:24.360 --> 01:12:29.940 align:middle line:84%
And we're not invoking the
intervention of the infinite

01:12:29.940 --> 01:12:33.010 align:middle line:90%
and eternal to support this.

01:12:33.010 --> 01:12:37.300 align:middle line:84%
What we're doing is
engaging the planet,

01:12:37.300 --> 01:12:42.550 align:middle line:84%
which is a living organism, of
which we're an integral part.

01:12:42.550 --> 01:12:46.150 align:middle line:84%
We have been generated
by the planet.

01:12:46.150 --> 01:12:48.260 align:middle line:84%
We've been generated
by the planet.

01:12:48.260 --> 01:12:52.340 align:middle line:10%
We are intimately
related with the planet.

01:12:52.340 --> 01:12:55.360 align:middle line:84%
And so therefore, we have
to take care of the planet

01:12:55.360 --> 01:12:57.920 align:middle line:90%
just as though it's a child.

01:12:57.920 --> 01:13:00.670 align:middle line:84%
We have to have the same kind
of affection, the same kind

01:13:00.670 --> 01:13:02.710 align:middle line:90%
of caring for the planet.

01:13:02.710 --> 01:13:04.970 align:middle line:90%
And this is the new paradigm.

01:13:04.970 --> 01:13:07.900 align:middle line:84%
And it relates very
clearly to indigenous

01:13:07.900 --> 01:13:11.710 align:middle line:84%
views, which are
known as pantheists.

01:13:11.710 --> 01:13:13.450 align:middle line:84%
This other thing,
this other thing,

01:13:13.450 --> 01:13:16.630 align:middle line:84%
the theistic point of view,
is what they call panantheism.

01:13:16.630 --> 01:13:17.790 align:middle line:90%
It's different.

01:13:17.790 --> 01:13:19.790 align:middle line:84%
You don't spend a lot of
time worrying about it.

01:13:19.790 --> 01:13:24.160 align:middle line:84%
But pantheism is what the
Catholic Church for so long

01:13:24.160 --> 01:13:26.560 align:middle line:90%
condemned as paganism.

01:13:26.560 --> 01:13:29.680 align:middle line:84%
And the Catholic
church is now moving.

01:13:29.680 --> 01:13:31.660 align:middle line:90%
The fact is Francis wrote the--

01:13:31.660 --> 01:13:35.380 align:middle line:84%
Pope Francis wrote the papal
on the cyclical, "Laudato Si,"

01:13:35.380 --> 01:13:38.350 align:middle line:90%
back in June of 19-- of 2015.

01:13:38.350 --> 01:13:41.740 align:middle line:84%
And the right wing bishops are
going crazy with their hair

01:13:41.740 --> 01:13:44.680 align:middle line:84%
on fire, saying, ooh,
this is pantheism.

01:13:44.680 --> 01:13:46.300 align:middle line:90%
This is paganism.

01:13:46.300 --> 01:13:50.670 align:middle line:84%
He's actually talking about
the planet having a spirit

01:13:50.670 --> 01:13:52.360 align:middle line:90%
that we relate to.

01:13:52.360 --> 01:13:53.860 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, right.

01:13:53.860 --> 01:13:56.650 align:middle line:90%
That's right.

01:13:56.650 --> 01:14:01.930 align:middle line:84%
And so what I'm suggesting
we do is all of us

01:14:01.930 --> 01:14:05.560 align:middle line:84%
can be extraordinarily positive
about the seventh paradigm,

01:14:05.560 --> 01:14:08.350 align:middle line:84%
the theistic paradigm
that we talked about,

01:14:08.350 --> 01:14:12.490 align:middle line:84%
and even be extraordinarily open
to the eighth paradigm of what

01:14:12.490 --> 01:14:15.310 align:middle line:84%
the worldview is that we're
going to have to adopt in order

01:14:15.310 --> 01:14:19.990 align:middle line:84%
to understand that we, in fact,
are not only not any longer

01:14:19.990 --> 01:14:22.300 align:middle line:84%
at the center of the
physical universe,

01:14:22.300 --> 01:14:25.720 align:middle line:84%
but we're not even at
the apex of the pyramid

01:14:25.720 --> 01:14:28.600 align:middle line:84%
of all conscious
beings in the universe.

01:14:28.600 --> 01:14:33.550 align:middle line:84%
We have been displaced now
by another highly intelligent

01:14:33.550 --> 01:14:35.890 align:middle line:84%
and highly
technologically developed,

01:14:35.890 --> 01:14:38.920 align:middle line:84%
but distinctly
non-human civilization.

01:14:38.920 --> 01:14:41.710 align:middle line:84%
And we have to come
to grips with that.

01:14:41.710 --> 01:14:49.810 align:middle line:84%
But not yet, not
yet, because we've

01:14:49.810 --> 01:14:53.120 align:middle line:84%
got this incredible emergency
in front of us right now.

01:14:53.120 --> 01:14:54.550 align:middle line:84%
And so we're going
to have to look

01:14:54.550 --> 01:14:57.100 align:middle line:84%
to the new paradigm, the
sixth paradigm, the quantum

01:14:57.100 --> 01:15:00.220 align:middle line:84%
worldview, the one that's all
being talked about by all of us

01:15:00.220 --> 01:15:03.910 align:middle line:84%
in the new age community
here and talk about this.

01:15:03.910 --> 01:15:07.220 align:middle line:84%
We can all work very hard to
get ready for the new paradigm,

01:15:07.220 --> 01:15:12.010 align:middle line:84%
the genuinely new paradigm,
or the eight paradigm, when--

01:15:12.010 --> 01:15:13.930 align:middle line:84%
as you know, the
churches and others

01:15:13.930 --> 01:15:16.600 align:middle line:84%
have all talked about
the fact that we are now

01:15:16.600 --> 01:15:19.810 align:middle line:84%
going to encounter the
existence of an extraterrestrial

01:15:19.810 --> 01:15:23.470 align:middle line:84%
intelligence much, much sooner
than we had ever anticipated,

01:15:23.470 --> 01:15:26.185 align:middle line:84%
because of the discovery
of all of the exoplanets

01:15:26.185 --> 01:15:27.060 align:middle line:90%
that we're going to--

01:15:27.060 --> 01:15:28.810 align:middle line:84%
I know how they're
going to do this.

01:15:28.810 --> 01:15:31.240 align:middle line:84%
They're going to roll
it in with the discovery

01:15:31.240 --> 01:15:32.780 align:middle line:90%
of the new exoplanets.

01:15:32.780 --> 01:15:34.300 align:middle line:84%
They're going to
find one exoplanet.

01:15:34.300 --> 01:15:36.495 align:middle line:84%
Oh, now they've
discovered water on Mars.

01:15:36.495 --> 01:15:37.370 align:middle line:90%
And what do you know?

01:15:37.370 --> 01:15:38.500 align:middle line:84%
Oh, there's some
remnants of water

01:15:38.500 --> 01:15:40.250 align:middle line:84%
on the moon, which
they were adamant there

01:15:40.250 --> 01:15:41.393 align:middle line:90%
wasn't any such thing.

01:15:41.393 --> 01:15:43.810 align:middle line:84%
And now they realize there are
planets, which they weren't

01:15:43.810 --> 01:15:45.370 align:middle line:84%
even willing to
acknowledge, which

01:15:45.370 --> 01:15:47.890 align:middle line:90%
tells you something about them.

01:15:47.890 --> 01:15:50.060 align:middle line:84%
But they now acknowledge
there are other planets.

01:15:50.060 --> 01:15:52.480 align:middle line:84%
They're going to
discover some microbe

01:15:52.480 --> 01:15:55.210 align:middle line:84%
of life underneath
the ice and some moon

01:15:55.210 --> 01:15:56.525 align:middle line:90%
of some distant planet.

01:15:56.525 --> 01:15:58.150 align:middle line:84%
They're going to
start discovering more

01:15:58.150 --> 01:16:00.780 align:middle line:90%
and more evolved forms of life.

01:16:00.780 --> 01:16:04.120 align:middle line:84%
And they're going to try to
go another entire generation

01:16:04.120 --> 01:16:07.320 align:middle line:84%
of slowly feathering in
the existence of life.

01:16:07.320 --> 01:16:10.480 align:middle line:84%
They're going to try to
completely ignore all the UFOs,

01:16:10.480 --> 01:16:12.233 align:middle line:84%
all the ET encounters
that everyone's had.

01:16:12.233 --> 01:16:14.650 align:middle line:84%
They don't want to have to
come to grips with what they've

01:16:14.650 --> 01:16:16.990 align:middle line:84%
been doing and concealing
it and lying about it

01:16:16.990 --> 01:16:18.940 align:middle line:84%
and punishing people
for their experience

01:16:18.940 --> 01:16:20.997 align:middle line:84%
and trying to get them
declared to be insane

01:16:20.997 --> 01:16:22.580 align:middle line:84%
and everything else
that they've done.

01:16:22.580 --> 01:16:24.670 align:middle line:84%
They don't want to come
to grips with that.

01:16:24.670 --> 01:16:28.120 align:middle line:84%
They want to just look to the
exoplanets as a source of life.

01:16:28.120 --> 01:16:30.700 align:middle line:84%
And so they're going to spend
another generation getting

01:16:30.700 --> 01:16:32.620 align:middle line:90%
us ready for this whole thing.

01:16:32.620 --> 01:16:35.080 align:middle line:90%
So that's down the line.

01:16:35.080 --> 01:16:37.450 align:middle line:84%
And that worldview, we have
to work on that worldview

01:16:37.450 --> 01:16:40.060 align:middle line:84%
to discuss the profound
philosophical theological

01:16:40.060 --> 01:16:43.090 align:middle line:84%
implications of our
being dislocated

01:16:43.090 --> 01:16:47.080 align:middle line:84%
from the peak of the pyramid of
conscious life in the universe.

01:16:47.080 --> 01:16:49.320 align:middle line:90%
But not yet.

01:16:49.320 --> 01:16:50.400 align:middle line:90%
Not yet.

01:16:50.400 --> 01:16:53.100 align:middle line:84%
We've got to get to the issue
of global climate change.

01:16:53.100 --> 01:16:54.480 align:middle line:84%
And we've got to
come and embrace

01:16:54.480 --> 01:16:58.050 align:middle line:84%
the sixth paradigm worldview,
the radical quantum worldview.

01:16:58.050 --> 01:17:01.500 align:middle line:84%
We've got to understand that
it's our collective intention,

01:17:01.500 --> 01:17:05.610 align:middle line:84%
motivated by love and affection
for our planet as an organism

01:17:05.610 --> 01:17:08.070 align:middle line:84%
out of which we arise,
and that there's

01:17:08.070 --> 01:17:11.160 align:middle line:84%
an intimate integral organic
relationship that we have

01:17:11.160 --> 01:17:15.420 align:middle line:84%
to the planet, and that we
have to work to save ourselves

01:17:15.420 --> 01:17:17.470 align:middle line:90%
and to save our planet.

01:17:17.470 --> 01:17:19.890 align:middle line:84%
In fact, a huge
majority of the people

01:17:19.890 --> 01:17:22.230 align:middle line:84%
that have encountered the
extraterrestrial beings

01:17:22.230 --> 01:17:24.372 align:middle line:84%
are saying they keep
trying to tell you this.

01:17:24.372 --> 01:17:25.830 align:middle line:84%
They keep trying
to say, you've got

01:17:25.830 --> 01:17:27.300 align:middle line:90%
to stop polluting your planet.

01:17:27.300 --> 01:17:30.840 align:middle line:84%
You've got to stop ruining your
whole climate on your planet.

01:17:30.840 --> 01:17:34.780 align:middle line:84%
They've been saying
this now for decades.

01:17:34.780 --> 01:17:36.990 align:middle line:84%
So that whole UFO
community thing

01:17:36.990 --> 01:17:40.980 align:middle line:84%
that we're involved in also
bears out what we're saying.

01:17:40.980 --> 01:17:44.670 align:middle line:84%
But we cannot do the heavy
lifting to have to establish

01:17:44.670 --> 01:17:47.400 align:middle line:84%
such a completely radical
brand new worldview.

01:17:47.400 --> 01:17:50.340 align:middle line:84%
We need to go to the
sixth paradigm worldview.

01:17:50.340 --> 01:17:53.190 align:middle line:84%
We've got to flesh out all the
implications of this quantum

01:17:53.190 --> 01:17:56.190 align:middle line:84%
worldview for our theology,
for our economics,

01:17:56.190 --> 01:17:57.760 align:middle line:90%
for our philosophies.

01:17:57.760 --> 01:17:59.890 align:middle line:90%
This is what we've got to do.

01:17:59.890 --> 01:18:01.470 align:middle line:90%
So this is the new paradigm.

01:18:01.470 --> 01:18:05.370 align:middle line:84%
That's why I'm advocating that
we work together to flesh out

01:18:05.370 --> 01:18:08.370 align:middle line:84%
the details of the new
paradigm and relate it directly

01:18:08.370 --> 01:18:13.830 align:middle line:84%
to the need to save our planet
and to move a spiritual vision

01:18:13.830 --> 01:18:16.890 align:middle line:84%
into place to
supplement the strictly

01:18:16.890 --> 01:18:20.670 align:middle line:84%
political and economic issues,
because the fact of the matter

01:18:20.670 --> 01:18:25.290 align:middle line:84%
is they're not working,
because the opponents of this

01:18:25.290 --> 01:18:27.000 align:middle line:90%
are completely dug in.

01:18:27.000 --> 01:18:28.720 align:middle line:84%
And they've got
access to the media.

01:18:28.720 --> 01:18:30.300 align:middle line:90%
They've got access to the money.

01:18:30.300 --> 01:18:32.460 align:middle line:84%
They've got access to the
political power, and then

01:18:32.460 --> 01:18:33.780 align:middle line:90%
the military power.

01:18:33.780 --> 01:18:36.200 align:middle line:90%
What we have is spiritual power.

01:18:36.200 --> 01:18:39.600 align:middle line:84%
And it's a secret
resource that we have.

01:18:39.600 --> 01:18:42.130 align:middle line:84%
And we need to bring
it to the fore.

01:18:42.130 --> 01:18:43.200 align:middle line:90%
We need to strengthen it.

01:18:43.200 --> 01:18:44.880 align:middle line:84%
We need to reach
out, and we need

01:18:44.880 --> 01:18:46.810 align:middle line:84%
to supplement all
the work we're doing.

01:18:46.810 --> 01:18:51.150 align:middle line:84%
Our office is doing
the outline of it.

01:18:51.150 --> 01:18:53.040 align:middle line:90%
We're doing the details of it.

01:18:53.040 --> 01:18:55.200 align:middle line:84%
We're in communication
with the Democratic Central

01:18:55.200 --> 01:18:57.870 align:middle line:90%
Committee of California.

01:18:57.870 --> 01:19:00.390 align:middle line:84%
We're doing all
the nuts and bolts.

01:19:00.390 --> 01:19:02.950 align:middle line:90%
That's why you have lawyers--

01:19:02.950 --> 01:19:03.750 align:middle line:90%
so you can do that.

01:19:03.750 --> 01:19:06.208 align:middle line:84%
You know what the nuts and
bolts are that have to get done.

01:19:06.208 --> 01:19:10.980 align:middle line:84%
But what we need to do here
is bring the spiritual vision

01:19:10.980 --> 01:19:13.530 align:middle line:84%
of the new paradigm
behind the need

01:19:13.530 --> 01:19:16.530 align:middle line:84%
to save our planet,
to save our species.

01:19:16.530 --> 01:19:19.080 align:middle line:84%
Remember, all species
don't survive.

01:19:19.080 --> 01:19:22.060 align:middle line:90%


01:19:22.060 --> 01:19:25.120 align:middle line:90%
All species don't survive.

01:19:25.120 --> 01:19:27.280 align:middle line:84%
So the dice are
rolling right now as

01:19:27.280 --> 01:19:29.950 align:middle line:84%
to whether we're going to,
whether we have contaminated

01:19:29.950 --> 01:19:31.570 align:middle line:84%
our own bed, whether
we've destroyed

01:19:31.570 --> 01:19:34.540 align:middle line:84%
our own planet, our
entire ecosystem,

01:19:34.540 --> 01:19:37.000 align:middle line:84%
despite the warnings that the
extraterrestrial beings have

01:19:37.000 --> 01:19:39.190 align:middle line:90%
been giving to us for decades.

01:19:39.190 --> 01:19:40.570 align:middle line:90%
We've got to change.

01:19:40.570 --> 01:19:41.610 align:middle line:90%
We've got to move.

01:19:41.610 --> 01:19:44.170 align:middle line:84%
And we've got to understand
what this new paradigm is

01:19:44.170 --> 01:19:49.413 align:middle line:84%
and what the philosophical
and spiritual basis is

01:19:49.413 --> 01:19:51.580 align:middle line:84%
that we can bring to the
discussion of the Green New

01:19:51.580 --> 01:19:52.510 align:middle line:90%
Deal.

01:19:52.510 --> 01:19:54.430 align:middle line:84%
So that's what I'm
proposing here.

01:19:54.430 --> 01:19:56.980 align:middle line:84%
And that's the relationship
between the awakening

01:19:56.980 --> 01:20:01.000 align:middle line:84%
to the new paradigm and the
passage of the Green New Deal.

01:20:01.000 --> 01:20:01.840 align:middle line:90%
So there I am.

01:20:01.840 --> 01:20:12.160 align:middle line:90%


01:20:12.160 --> 01:20:16.410 align:middle line:90%

01:20:16.410 --> 01:20:18.000 align:middle line:90%
