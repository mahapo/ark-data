00:00:06.650 --> 00:00:10.310 align:middle line:84%
>> For 37 years, Darryl Anka has
channeled the multi-dimensional

00:00:10.310 --> 00:00:12.620 align:middle line:90%
being known as Bashar.

00:00:12.620 --> 00:00:16.880 align:middle line:84%
Bashar describes himself as
an extra terrestrial being

00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:22.460 align:middle line:84%
from the future, a first contact
specialist, who is specifically

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:28.100 align:middle line:84%
involved preparing earth for
extraterrestrial contact.

00:00:28.100 --> 00:00:29.300 align:middle line:90%
I'm your host Jimmy Church.

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:31.340 align:middle line:90%
It's been an amazing weekend.

00:00:31.340 --> 00:00:35.290 align:middle line:84%
I want you to give the
warmest, Conscious Life

00:00:35.290 --> 00:00:40.370 align:middle line:90%
2020 welcome to Bashar.

00:00:40.370 --> 00:00:41.270 align:middle line:90%
Let's do this.

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:43.765 align:middle line:90%
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:43.765 --> 00:00:58.740 align:middle line:90%


00:00:58.740 --> 00:01:00.147 align:middle line:90%
>> Thank you all very much.

00:01:00.147 --> 00:01:00.980 align:middle line:90%
It's been wonderful.

00:01:00.980 --> 00:01:01.780 align:middle line:90%
Good night.

00:01:01.780 --> 00:01:03.910 align:middle line:90%
[AUDIENCE LAUGHTER]

00:01:03.910 --> 00:01:07.450 align:middle line:84%
No, literally, truly, thank
you all for being here.

00:01:07.450 --> 00:01:10.540 align:middle line:84%
This is really, really wonderful
to have all of your energy

00:01:10.540 --> 00:01:11.340 align:middle line:90%
here.

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:13.170 align:middle line:90%
We really appreciate it.

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:16.827 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to go ahead and get
going to give you enough time

00:01:16.827 --> 00:01:19.410 align:middle line:84%
to interact with Bashar since I
know the venue is a little bit

00:01:19.410 --> 00:01:20.280 align:middle line:90%
short.

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:23.580 align:middle line:84%
So please have a wonderful
time, and I look forward

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:24.730 align:middle line:90%
to seeing you later.

00:01:24.730 --> 00:01:25.530 align:middle line:90%
Thanks a lot.

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:27.620 align:middle line:90%
[APPLAUSE]

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:50.620 align:middle line:90%


00:01:50.620 --> 00:01:51.680 align:middle line:90%
Just a quick question.

00:01:51.680 --> 00:01:55.420 align:middle line:84%
How many of you have never
experienced Bashar in person?

00:01:55.420 --> 00:01:58.057 align:middle line:90%
Everyone, OK.

00:01:58.057 --> 00:01:59.390 align:middle line:90%
All right, well have a fun time.

00:01:59.390 --> 00:03:06.360 align:middle line:90%


00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:07.860 align:middle line:84%
All right, I'll say
good day to you.

00:03:07.860 --> 00:03:09.130 align:middle line:90%
This day of your time.

00:03:09.130 --> 00:03:10.040 align:middle line:90%
How are you all?

00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:11.904 align:middle line:90%
[APPLAUSE]

00:03:11.904 --> 00:03:14.330 align:middle line:90%


00:03:14.330 --> 00:03:16.340 align:middle line:10%
All right, all right.

00:03:16.340 --> 00:03:18.380 align:middle line:84%
Thank you once again
for the co-creation

00:03:18.380 --> 00:03:20.440 align:middle line:90%
of this interaction.

00:03:20.440 --> 00:03:24.880 align:middle line:10%
It is always a gift to us to
experience through each of you

00:03:24.880 --> 00:03:27.490 align:middle line:10%
that many more facets of
the multidimensional crystal

00:03:27.490 --> 00:03:29.460 align:middle line:10%
of creation.

00:03:29.460 --> 00:03:32.700 align:middle line:84%
We would like to begin
this transmission that

00:03:32.700 --> 00:03:39.700 align:middle line:84%
is titled The Power of
Paradox in the following way.

00:03:39.700 --> 00:03:49.940 align:middle line:84%
Trust, empowerment, connection,
confidence, control.

00:03:49.940 --> 00:03:55.780 align:middle line:10%
These are experiences that
many people on your planet

00:03:55.780 --> 00:04:00.630 align:middle line:10%
have many challenges
with, but there is a way

00:04:00.630 --> 00:04:04.790 align:middle line:10%
to understand these
states of being,

00:04:04.790 --> 00:04:11.770 align:middle line:10%
so that even though when
you experience ideas like,

00:04:11.770 --> 00:04:18.790 align:middle line:10%
I lack trust, I lack
confidence, I'm out of control,

00:04:18.790 --> 00:04:26.740 align:middle line:10%
I don't feel a connection,
those kinds of ideas,

00:04:26.740 --> 00:04:31.420 align:middle line:10%
there are ways to understand
how reality works,

00:04:31.420 --> 00:04:35.380 align:middle line:10%
so that you can see the
paradox in those statements,

00:04:35.380 --> 00:04:41.170 align:middle line:10%
because every time, you may
feel or utter, negative,

00:04:41.170 --> 00:04:46.280 align:middle line:10%
fear based belief system
statements in that way,

00:04:46.280 --> 00:04:49.610 align:middle line:10%
there is always a way to
understand how to turn them

00:04:49.610 --> 00:04:55.830 align:middle line:10%
around, how to reverse
them into a positive state

00:04:55.830 --> 00:04:59.220 align:middle line:10%
by simply understanding
the paradox that exists

00:04:59.220 --> 00:05:02.740 align:middle line:10%
within statements of that kind.

00:05:02.740 --> 00:05:06.870 align:middle line:10%
For example, as we have
sometimes discussed,

00:05:06.870 --> 00:05:13.760 align:middle line:10%
when someone feels that they
lack trust, this is actually

00:05:13.760 --> 00:05:18.920 align:middle line:10%
impossible, because if you
are saying, I lack trust,

00:05:18.920 --> 00:05:19.850 align:middle line:10%
you're trusting that.

00:05:19.850 --> 00:05:22.125 align:middle line:90%
[AUDIENCE LAUGHTER]

00:05:22.125 --> 00:05:23.490 align:middle line:90%


00:05:23.490 --> 00:05:27.420 align:middle line:84%
If you say, I lack confidence,
you're confident about that.

00:05:27.420 --> 00:05:30.180 align:middle line:10%
[AUDIENCE LAUGHTER]

00:05:30.180 --> 00:05:33.150 align:middle line:84%
I am out of control, but you're
controlling that experience.

00:05:33.150 --> 00:05:35.400 align:middle line:90%
[AUDIENCE LAUGHTER]

00:05:35.400 --> 00:05:38.623 align:middle line:84%
I am not connected, but you
have to be connected to have

00:05:38.623 --> 00:05:39.915 align:middle line:90%
an experience of disconnection.

00:05:39.915 --> 00:05:41.430 align:middle line:90%
[AUDIENCE LAUGHTER]

00:05:41.430 --> 00:05:43.890 align:middle line:84%
Because if you
weren't connected,

00:05:43.890 --> 00:05:48.180 align:middle line:84%
you would have no
experience at all.

00:05:48.180 --> 00:05:53.940 align:middle line:10%
These ideas contained their
own paradoxical opposites.

00:05:53.940 --> 00:05:56.850 align:middle line:10%
If you understand
how reality actually

00:05:56.850 --> 00:06:01.290 align:middle line:10%
works, if you understand
your place within existence,

00:06:01.290 --> 00:06:03.510 align:middle line:10%
you will understand
that you don't have

00:06:03.510 --> 00:06:05.640 align:middle line:10%
to learn to do these things.

00:06:05.640 --> 00:06:08.160 align:middle line:84%
You don't have to
learn to trust.

00:06:08.160 --> 00:06:10.060 align:middle line:90%
It's built in.

00:06:10.060 --> 00:06:12.840 align:middle line:84%
It's not an issue
of lacking trust.

00:06:12.840 --> 00:06:16.630 align:middle line:84%
It's an issue of
trusting in lack.

00:06:16.630 --> 00:06:20.080 align:middle line:84%
You're always trusting
something to be true,

00:06:20.080 --> 00:06:25.400 align:middle line:84%
or again, you wouldn't have
an experience of any kind.

00:06:25.400 --> 00:06:29.110 align:middle line:10%
So again, when you
say, I lack confidence,

00:06:29.110 --> 00:06:34.550 align:middle line:10%
you are stating a
very confident idea.

00:06:34.550 --> 00:06:38.900 align:middle line:84%
You are very confident about
your lack of confidence.

00:06:38.900 --> 00:06:42.350 align:middle line:10%
So the idea is when
you feel those things,

00:06:42.350 --> 00:06:45.290 align:middle line:10%
find yourself believing
in those ideas,

00:06:45.290 --> 00:06:48.560 align:middle line:10%
remind yourself that you
don't have to learn to trust,

00:06:48.560 --> 00:06:50.300 align:middle line:10%
you don't have to
learn to be confident,

00:06:50.300 --> 00:06:53.330 align:middle line:10%
you don't have to
learn to be in control,

00:06:53.330 --> 00:06:56.990 align:middle line:10%
you don't have to learn how
to be connected to reality,

00:06:56.990 --> 00:06:59.720 align:middle line:10%
to the cosmos, to all that is.

00:06:59.720 --> 00:07:01.460 align:middle line:90%
You already do this.

00:07:01.460 --> 00:07:02.270 align:middle line:90%
It's automatic.

00:07:02.270 --> 00:07:06.650 align:middle line:84%
It's built into you as a
reflection of creation.

00:07:06.650 --> 00:07:07.970 align:middle line:90%
You can't help it.

00:07:07.970 --> 00:07:10.520 align:middle line:90%
You just do it automatically.

00:07:10.520 --> 00:07:13.650 align:middle line:84%
Again, you wouldn't have an
experience if you didn't.

00:07:13.650 --> 00:07:17.000 align:middle line:10%
So the next time
you hear yourself

00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:20.100 align:middle line:10%
and catch yourself
bemoaning the fact

00:07:20.100 --> 00:07:23.220 align:middle line:10%
that you have no trust, that
you have no confidence, that you

00:07:23.220 --> 00:07:28.410 align:middle line:10%
have no control, that you don't
feel a connection, so on and so

00:07:28.410 --> 00:07:34.350 align:middle line:10%
forth, stop yourself, remind
yourself that the opposite must

00:07:34.350 --> 00:07:40.290 align:middle line:10%
actually be the truth, and you
simply have, for some reason,

00:07:40.290 --> 00:07:44.000 align:middle line:10%
something you've bought into
as a belief, that allows you

00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:46.400 align:middle line:10%
to use your trust,
use your confidence,

00:07:46.400 --> 00:07:50.570 align:middle line:10%
use your connection, use your
control in ways that you don't

00:07:50.570 --> 00:07:53.210 align:middle line:10%
necessarily prefer to.

00:07:53.210 --> 00:07:55.910 align:middle line:84%
And that means
you've made a choice

00:07:55.910 --> 00:07:59.210 align:middle line:84%
to have that experience
on some level.

00:07:59.210 --> 00:08:01.670 align:middle line:10%
Usually, these beliefs
might be ensconced

00:08:01.670 --> 00:08:05.210 align:middle line:10%
in your unconscious mind,
and so the whole idea,

00:08:05.210 --> 00:08:07.290 align:middle line:10%
when you catch yourself
saying those things,

00:08:07.290 --> 00:08:10.220 align:middle line:10%
thinking those things,
feeling those things,

00:08:10.220 --> 00:08:13.580 align:middle line:10%
is to realize that you
might be describing

00:08:13.580 --> 00:08:17.030 align:middle line:10%
a way in which you're using your
trust, using your connection,

00:08:17.030 --> 00:08:20.720 align:middle line:10%
using your confidence, but
that the statement itself

00:08:20.720 --> 00:08:22.910 align:middle line:10%
is not a fact.

00:08:22.910 --> 00:08:24.500 align:middle line:10%
It's simply the
product of something

00:08:24.500 --> 00:08:27.590 align:middle line:10%
you've been taught to believe
is true about yourself

00:08:27.590 --> 00:08:30.440 align:middle line:10%
in that particular
circumstance or situation,

00:08:30.440 --> 00:08:34.250 align:middle line:10%
and if you start to realize that
it can't really be possible,

00:08:34.250 --> 00:08:36.929 align:middle line:10%
that you can lack trust
or lack confidence,

00:08:36.929 --> 00:08:38.419 align:middle line:10%
then you can remind
yourself when

00:08:38.419 --> 00:08:40.280 align:middle line:10%
you hear those statements
coming from you

00:08:40.280 --> 00:08:42.830 align:middle line:10%
or passing through your
mind, you can remind yourself

00:08:42.830 --> 00:08:47.140 align:middle line:10%
in that moment, wait a
minute, I heard that,

00:08:47.140 --> 00:08:50.390 align:middle line:10%
and I'm catching it,
and it's not a fact.

00:08:50.390 --> 00:08:51.710 align:middle line:90%
It's just an opinion.

00:08:51.710 --> 00:08:52.820 align:middle line:90%
It's a perspective.

00:08:52.820 --> 00:08:54.170 align:middle line:90%
It's a belief.

00:08:54.170 --> 00:08:56.990 align:middle line:90%
And those things can be changed.

00:08:56.990 --> 00:09:01.280 align:middle line:84%
When you are, very often
growing up on your planet,

00:09:01.280 --> 00:09:03.890 align:middle line:84%
you are taught to
believe certain things.

00:09:03.890 --> 00:09:06.560 align:middle line:84%
You pick them up sometimes
even telepathically

00:09:06.560 --> 00:09:09.050 align:middle line:84%
from your parents, from your
friends, from your society,

00:09:09.050 --> 00:09:10.460 align:middle line:90%
from your schooling.

00:09:10.460 --> 00:09:12.920 align:middle line:10%
But when you finally
arrive at the place

00:09:12.920 --> 00:09:15.500 align:middle line:10%
where you are maturing
into adulthood,

00:09:15.500 --> 00:09:17.600 align:middle line:10%
you suddenly realize
that you're carrying

00:09:17.600 --> 00:09:20.600 align:middle line:10%
around all of this
baggage from other people

00:09:20.600 --> 00:09:23.600 align:middle line:10%
that you've bought into and
picked up along the way.

00:09:23.600 --> 00:09:26.000 align:middle line:90%
And it starts to weigh you down.

00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:30.480 align:middle line:84%
You feel like you're
dragging it along.

00:09:30.480 --> 00:09:33.900 align:middle line:90%
Your own bags weigh nothing.

00:09:33.900 --> 00:09:36.930 align:middle line:84%
If you feel held back,
if you feel dragged down

00:09:36.930 --> 00:09:39.930 align:middle line:84%
by certain ideas and
beliefs within you,

00:09:39.930 --> 00:09:42.360 align:middle line:84%
that should be your first clue
that you're carrying around

00:09:42.360 --> 00:09:46.690 align:middle line:84%
someone else's baggage
that doesn't belong to you.

00:09:46.690 --> 00:09:49.120 align:middle line:84%
You're carrying around
someone else's belief

00:09:49.120 --> 00:09:53.800 align:middle line:84%
system that isn't necessarily
something you need to share.

00:09:53.800 --> 00:09:56.260 align:middle line:84%
When you were growing
up, you swallowed it all

00:09:56.260 --> 00:09:58.900 align:middle line:84%
because you needed someone
to take care of you,

00:09:58.900 --> 00:10:01.910 align:middle line:84%
and so you wanted to appease
your family, your friends,

00:10:01.910 --> 00:10:04.070 align:middle line:84%
your society, your
schooling by saying,

00:10:04.070 --> 00:10:07.710 align:middle line:84%
all right, I'll go
along with this for now.

00:10:07.710 --> 00:10:10.797 align:middle line:84%
But by the time you grow up,
it's become so unconscious,

00:10:10.797 --> 00:10:12.630 align:middle line:84%
it's become so automatic
that you won't even

00:10:12.630 --> 00:10:14.910 align:middle line:84%
realize that you
swallowed all these belief

00:10:14.910 --> 00:10:17.460 align:middle line:84%
systems that had nothing
to do with who you truly

00:10:17.460 --> 00:10:19.500 align:middle line:90%
are as a being.

00:10:19.500 --> 00:10:22.300 align:middle line:84%
And so the process
starts happening

00:10:22.300 --> 00:10:25.140 align:middle line:84%
where you start realizing
that these things are not

00:10:25.140 --> 00:10:28.170 align:middle line:84%
in alignment with who
you feel you need to be,

00:10:28.170 --> 00:10:29.730 align:middle line:90%
who you prefer to be.

00:10:29.730 --> 00:10:31.440 align:middle line:90%
The vibrations don't match.

00:10:31.440 --> 00:10:33.100 align:middle line:90%
It doesn't feel comfortable.

00:10:33.100 --> 00:10:35.820 align:middle line:90%
It's not where you truly live.

00:10:35.820 --> 00:10:38.490 align:middle line:84%
And therefore, you have to
start the process of divesting

00:10:38.490 --> 00:10:41.380 align:middle line:84%
yourself of these beliefs that
have nothing to do with you

00:10:41.380 --> 00:10:44.810 align:middle line:84%
that you've been carrying
around for so many years.

00:10:44.810 --> 00:10:47.350 align:middle line:10%
So the idea is simply when
you get into that state

00:10:47.350 --> 00:10:50.290 align:middle line:10%
where you start feeling
that the thing you just

00:10:50.290 --> 00:10:53.680 align:middle line:10%
said about yourself
in a circumstance

00:10:53.680 --> 00:10:57.010 align:middle line:10%
feels like it's rubbing you
the wrong way, as you say,

00:10:57.010 --> 00:10:59.350 align:middle line:10%
it's time to stop
and take a moment

00:10:59.350 --> 00:11:03.010 align:middle line:10%
and pay attention because
right then and right there

00:11:03.010 --> 00:11:05.230 align:middle line:10%
is the most important
moment for you

00:11:05.230 --> 00:11:08.470 align:middle line:10%
to start getting in touch with
what those beliefs are that are

00:11:08.470 --> 00:11:10.960 align:middle line:10%
in your unconscious
mind and bring them

00:11:10.960 --> 00:11:12.800 align:middle line:10%
into the light of
your consciousness,

00:11:12.800 --> 00:11:15.880 align:middle line:10%
so that you can see that
they don't belong to you,

00:11:15.880 --> 00:11:18.940 align:middle line:10%
that they make no sense
for who you prefer to be,

00:11:18.940 --> 00:11:21.970 align:middle line:10%
and then you can
start to realize

00:11:21.970 --> 00:11:25.360 align:middle line:10%
what is and isn't your truth.

00:11:25.360 --> 00:11:27.000 align:middle line:10%
Does that make sense?

00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:30.520 align:middle line:10%
All right, very simple
technique for any one of you

00:11:30.520 --> 00:11:32.080 align:middle line:10%
in any circumstance
where you start

00:11:32.080 --> 00:11:36.130 align:middle line:10%
feeling that incompatible
vibration is first

00:11:36.130 --> 00:11:38.830 align:middle line:10%
and foremost-- of course, be
honest within your own self

00:11:38.830 --> 00:11:42.340 align:middle line:10%
investigation and allow
yourself to realize

00:11:42.340 --> 00:11:45.820 align:middle line:10%
the difference between whether
it is truly something that

00:11:45.820 --> 00:11:47.680 align:middle line:10%
is not representative
of who you are,

00:11:47.680 --> 00:11:49.630 align:middle line:10%
truly something that
is not representative

00:11:49.630 --> 00:11:52.420 align:middle line:10%
of your excitement, or whether
it is simply your belief

00:11:52.420 --> 00:11:55.360 align:middle line:10%
system, making it look that way.

00:11:55.360 --> 00:11:57.970 align:middle line:84%
As soon as you clear out with
yourself whether something

00:11:57.970 --> 00:12:01.750 align:middle line:84%
really is or isn't reflective
of who you prefer to be, then

00:12:01.750 --> 00:12:02.800 align:middle line:90%
you can move forward.

00:12:02.800 --> 00:12:08.020 align:middle line:84%
But the idea is to ask yourself
a question in one of two ways.

00:12:08.020 --> 00:12:10.480 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes, the first way
will work for some of you.

00:12:10.480 --> 00:12:14.230 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes, the second way will
work for different people.

00:12:14.230 --> 00:12:17.830 align:middle line:10%
The first way is when you feel
that, when you find yourself

00:12:17.830 --> 00:12:21.580 align:middle line:10%
in that moment,
what would I have

00:12:21.580 --> 00:12:25.600 align:middle line:10%
to believe is true about
myself in this situation

00:12:25.600 --> 00:12:31.280 align:middle line:10%
to feel, think, behave, or
experience what I am feeling,

00:12:31.280 --> 00:12:34.060 align:middle line:10%
thinking, behaving,
or experiencing?

00:12:34.060 --> 00:12:38.200 align:middle line:10%
Because all experiences,
all behaviors, all thoughts,

00:12:38.200 --> 00:12:43.730 align:middle line:10%
and all emotions come from what
you believe to be true first.

00:12:43.730 --> 00:12:45.320 align:middle line:90%
That's the blueprint.

00:12:45.320 --> 00:12:49.490 align:middle line:84%
The emotions are the
builders of the reality.

00:12:49.490 --> 00:12:51.770 align:middle line:84%
The thoughts are the
building materials.

00:12:51.770 --> 00:12:54.080 align:middle line:10%
The behaviors are the
way in which the builders

00:12:54.080 --> 00:12:56.480 align:middle line:10%
are building your house.

00:12:56.480 --> 00:12:59.780 align:middle line:84%
And the experience is you
living in the house that

00:12:59.780 --> 00:13:01.460 align:middle line:90%
was built from the blueprint.

00:13:01.460 --> 00:13:04.760 align:middle line:10%
And if it doesn't feel
comfortable in that house,

00:13:04.760 --> 00:13:06.920 align:middle line:10%
trace it back to
the blueprint, make

00:13:06.920 --> 00:13:10.640 align:middle line:10%
the changes there in the belief
system, and the emotions,

00:13:10.640 --> 00:13:12.860 align:middle line:10%
the builders, the
thoughts, the building

00:13:12.860 --> 00:13:15.530 align:middle line:10%
materials, the behaviors,
the style of building,

00:13:15.530 --> 00:13:18.500 align:middle line:10%
and the house will all
start to be in alignment

00:13:18.500 --> 00:13:21.020 align:middle line:10%
and feel comfortable
for you to live in,

00:13:21.020 --> 00:13:24.070 align:middle line:10%
which is your
experience of life.

00:13:24.070 --> 00:13:26.710 align:middle line:10%
So the idea is
ask that question.

00:13:26.710 --> 00:13:28.630 align:middle line:10%
The answer in some
way, shape, or form

00:13:28.630 --> 00:13:32.020 align:middle line:10%
will come either through a
dream or synchronicity or what

00:13:32.020 --> 00:13:36.030 align:middle line:10%
have you, or if you find that
asking the question that way,

00:13:36.030 --> 00:13:38.470 align:middle line:10%
what would I have to
believe is true about myself

00:13:38.470 --> 00:13:40.780 align:middle line:10%
in order to have this
experience, in this way,

00:13:40.780 --> 00:13:44.320 align:middle line:10%
to feel what I'm feeling, if the
answer doesn't come that way,

00:13:44.320 --> 00:13:47.980 align:middle line:10%
you can take advantage of the
fact that people on your planet

00:13:47.980 --> 00:13:51.460 align:middle line:10%
are so used to the idea
of dealing with fear,

00:13:51.460 --> 00:13:54.490 align:middle line:10%
that you can use it to your
advantage in the following way,

00:13:54.490 --> 00:13:57.310 align:middle line:10%
by asking the
question in this form.

00:13:57.310 --> 00:13:59.890 align:middle line:84%
If I did, in fact,
allow myself to be

00:13:59.890 --> 00:14:04.790 align:middle line:84%
who I really prefer to be,
what am I afraid might happen?

00:14:04.790 --> 00:14:08.390 align:middle line:84%
That will usually reveal
the fear based belief

00:14:08.390 --> 00:14:11.060 align:middle line:90%
if you are willing to hear it.

00:14:11.060 --> 00:14:13.450 align:middle line:84%
Then you have
something to work with.

00:14:13.450 --> 00:14:18.160 align:middle line:84%
As soon as you bring the actual
belief, the statement itself,

00:14:18.160 --> 00:14:21.310 align:middle line:84%
the way it's arranged,
the equation, so to speak,

00:14:21.310 --> 00:14:24.160 align:middle line:84%
of energy that is that
belief into the light

00:14:24.160 --> 00:14:26.110 align:middle line:84%
of your conscious mind,
and you're aware now

00:14:26.110 --> 00:14:30.080 align:middle line:84%
of what the belief
actually is, if you really

00:14:30.080 --> 00:14:33.200 align:middle line:84%
take a strong look at it, a
clear look at what it's saying,

00:14:33.200 --> 00:14:37.290 align:middle line:84%
you will realize one
very important thing.

00:14:37.290 --> 00:14:42.440 align:middle line:84%
The belief doesn't
make sense for you.

00:14:42.440 --> 00:14:44.900 align:middle line:10%
It's not logical anymore.

00:14:44.900 --> 00:14:47.660 align:middle line:10%
Because you can look around
and see when you might believe

00:14:47.660 --> 00:14:50.270 align:middle line:10%
something negative to
be true about yourself,

00:14:50.270 --> 00:14:52.490 align:middle line:10%
I don't deserve,
I'm not worthy, I

00:14:52.490 --> 00:14:54.920 align:middle line:10%
can't do this, when
you look around

00:14:54.920 --> 00:14:57.620 align:middle line:10%
and see other people who might
be doing the kinds of things

00:14:57.620 --> 00:15:00.410 align:middle line:10%
that you would love to be
doing, following their passion

00:15:00.410 --> 00:15:02.930 align:middle line:10%
like you might desire
to follow yours,

00:15:02.930 --> 00:15:06.530 align:middle line:10%
and you realize that they can
do it, then you can do it.

00:15:06.530 --> 00:15:10.160 align:middle line:10%
And so the idea of having this
belief system within you, that

00:15:10.160 --> 00:15:13.790 align:middle line:10%
doesn't make sense as to why
you would buy into this thing

00:15:13.790 --> 00:15:16.500 align:middle line:10%
when it's clear that
other people can do it,

00:15:16.500 --> 00:15:19.400 align:middle line:10%
and therefore, so can
you in your own terms,

00:15:19.400 --> 00:15:21.200 align:middle line:10%
then it starts to
not make sense.

00:15:21.200 --> 00:15:23.060 align:middle line:90%
And here's the important point.

00:15:23.060 --> 00:15:28.580 align:middle line:84%
As soon as a belief doesn't
make sense, it's gone.

00:15:28.580 --> 00:15:31.100 align:middle line:10%
That's the end of the
process of letting

00:15:31.100 --> 00:15:34.615 align:middle line:10%
it go, not the beginning,
because many people talk to us

00:15:34.615 --> 00:15:36.740 align:middle line:10%
and say, all right, now
I've discovered the belief,

00:15:36.740 --> 00:15:37.907 align:middle line:10%
and yeah, it makes no sense.

00:15:37.907 --> 00:15:40.760 align:middle line:84%
So now what do I do
to get rid of it?

00:15:40.760 --> 00:15:44.190 align:middle line:84%
You already have let it go
because it makes no sense.

00:15:44.190 --> 00:15:44.990 align:middle line:90%
Why?

00:15:44.990 --> 00:15:47.900 align:middle line:84%
Because you actually
don't hold on to things

00:15:47.900 --> 00:15:50.210 align:middle line:90%
that don't make sense.

00:15:50.210 --> 00:15:51.080 align:middle line:90%
You don't.

00:15:51.080 --> 00:15:52.430 align:middle line:90%
You never do.

00:15:52.430 --> 00:15:54.555 align:middle line:84%
Now, if you
intellectually understand

00:15:54.555 --> 00:15:56.180 align:middle line:84%
that it doesn't make
sense, and yet you

00:15:56.180 --> 00:15:58.550 align:middle line:84%
find yourself holding
on to it, that

00:15:58.550 --> 00:16:01.280 align:middle line:84%
should be your first clue that
you have a belief system that

00:16:01.280 --> 00:16:04.700 align:middle line:84%
is making it look
like it makes sense,

00:16:04.700 --> 00:16:07.520 align:middle line:84%
because that's the only reason
you would keep doing it,

00:16:07.520 --> 00:16:09.040 align:middle line:84%
you would keep
holding on to it is

00:16:09.040 --> 00:16:11.660 align:middle line:84%
you have a belief that says it
serves you to hold onto this.

00:16:11.660 --> 00:16:13.040 align:middle line:90%
Don't let it go.

00:16:13.040 --> 00:16:17.120 align:middle line:10%
Something worse will
happen if you let it go.

00:16:17.120 --> 00:16:20.430 align:middle line:84%
That's just the way negative
beliefs perpetuate themselves.

00:16:20.430 --> 00:16:22.910 align:middle line:84%
Because if belief systems,
both positive and negative,

00:16:22.910 --> 00:16:24.650 align:middle line:84%
didn't perpetuate
themselves, you

00:16:24.650 --> 00:16:26.750 align:middle line:84%
couldn't have a
physical experience,

00:16:26.750 --> 00:16:29.180 align:middle line:84%
because physical
reality isn't real.

00:16:29.180 --> 00:16:31.100 align:middle line:84%
You have to believe
that it's real,

00:16:31.100 --> 00:16:33.560 align:middle line:84%
and belief systems, both
positive and negative,

00:16:33.560 --> 00:16:35.750 align:middle line:84%
have to reinforce
themselves and make it

00:16:35.750 --> 00:16:38.390 align:middle line:84%
seem as if this physical
experience is actually

00:16:38.390 --> 00:16:41.750 align:middle line:84%
a real thing unto itself,
separate from you.

00:16:41.750 --> 00:16:43.300 align:middle line:90%
But it's not.

00:16:43.300 --> 00:16:47.720 align:middle line:84%
So a belief system will
use emotion, thoughts,

00:16:47.720 --> 00:16:51.680 align:middle line:84%
and behaviors and
experiences to reinforce

00:16:51.680 --> 00:16:56.540 align:middle line:84%
the reality of the belief
to make it seem like a fact

00:16:56.540 --> 00:16:59.120 align:middle line:90%
when it's nothing but a belief.

00:16:59.120 --> 00:17:01.910 align:middle line:84%
So allow yourselves
the opportunity

00:17:01.910 --> 00:17:05.089 align:middle line:84%
to realize that beliefs are
just designed to perpetuate

00:17:05.089 --> 00:17:07.400 align:middle line:84%
themselves so you can
have a physical experience

00:17:07.400 --> 00:17:10.550 align:middle line:84%
and realize that it's just a
belief that can be changed.

00:17:10.550 --> 00:17:12.230 align:middle line:10%
And as soon as
you allow yourself

00:17:12.230 --> 00:17:15.950 align:middle line:10%
to know the difference between
what really has to do with you

00:17:15.950 --> 00:17:18.020 align:middle line:10%
and who you prefer to
be and what does not,

00:17:18.020 --> 00:17:20.690 align:middle line:10%
as soon as you develop
that skill of discernment

00:17:20.690 --> 00:17:24.770 align:middle line:10%
by honest self-investigation and
start following the instruction

00:17:24.770 --> 00:17:27.560 align:middle line:10%
manual and the formula that
we've shared with many of you,

00:17:27.560 --> 00:17:29.900 align:middle line:10%
of acting on your passion
to the best you can

00:17:29.900 --> 00:17:32.600 align:middle line:10%
with no insistence and no
assumption of the outcome

00:17:32.600 --> 00:17:34.333 align:middle line:10%
and remain in a positive
state, no matter

00:17:34.333 --> 00:17:36.500 align:middle line:10%
what happens because it
doesn't matter what happens,

00:17:36.500 --> 00:17:39.980 align:middle line:10%
it only matters what you do
with what happens that makes

00:17:39.980 --> 00:17:41.660 align:middle line:10%
the difference in
your life, then

00:17:41.660 --> 00:17:45.020 align:middle line:10%
everything falls into place
automatically, it works,

00:17:45.020 --> 00:17:48.800 align:middle line:10%
it's self-perpetuating,
self-expanding, self-guiding,

00:17:48.800 --> 00:17:52.070 align:middle line:10%
and life will flow
automatically through you,

00:17:52.070 --> 00:17:55.945 align:middle line:10%
and you will experience
the joy of being you,

00:17:55.945 --> 00:17:57.320 align:middle line:10%
because each and
every one of you

00:17:57.320 --> 00:17:59.960 align:middle line:10%
is a unique
reflection of all that

00:17:59.960 --> 00:18:02.540 align:middle line:10%
is, of creation, of
existence itself,

00:18:02.540 --> 00:18:04.790 align:middle line:10%
and no one is going
to do anything exactly

00:18:04.790 --> 00:18:05.690 align:middle line:10%
as you would do it.

00:18:05.690 --> 00:18:08.960 align:middle line:10%
Sometimes it may look similar,
but it's never the same,

00:18:08.960 --> 00:18:10.610 align:middle line:10%
not exactly.

00:18:10.610 --> 00:18:14.990 align:middle line:10%
So honor and appreciate
your uniqueness.

00:18:14.990 --> 00:18:19.160 align:middle line:10%
Discover the beliefs
within you that prevent you

00:18:19.160 --> 00:18:22.160 align:middle line:10%
from being yourself,
and you will

00:18:22.160 --> 00:18:25.910 align:middle line:10%
have a life that is the
path of least resistance

00:18:25.910 --> 00:18:31.100 align:middle line:10%
and will be replete with
synchronicity in a manner that

00:18:31.100 --> 00:18:37.010 align:middle line:10%
will serve you on and on and
on in all the ways that benefit

00:18:37.010 --> 00:18:40.070 align:middle line:10%
you, in all the ways that
allow you more opportunity

00:18:40.070 --> 00:18:41.955 align:middle line:10%
to be who you truly are.

00:18:41.955 --> 00:18:42.830 align:middle line:90%
Does that make sense?

00:18:42.830 --> 00:18:44.050 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:18:44.050 --> 00:18:45.380 align:middle line:90%
>> All right.

00:18:45.380 --> 00:18:48.620 align:middle line:84%
We thank you for allowing us
to share this idea with you

00:18:48.620 --> 00:18:50.600 align:middle line:90%
this night of your time.

00:18:50.600 --> 00:18:53.990 align:middle line:84%
Allow yourselves to find
that power in paradox

00:18:53.990 --> 00:18:56.990 align:middle line:84%
when you hear yourself
talking yourself

00:18:56.990 --> 00:18:58.730 align:middle line:90%
into being someone you're not.

00:18:58.730 --> 00:19:01.400 align:middle line:90%


00:19:01.400 --> 00:19:04.430 align:middle line:84%
So in return for the
gift you have given us,

00:19:04.430 --> 00:19:08.780 align:middle line:84%
I ask you now in what way
may we be of service to you?

00:19:08.780 --> 00:19:11.060 align:middle line:84%
You may begin with your
questions and dialogue

00:19:11.060 --> 00:19:13.790 align:middle line:90%
if you wish.

00:19:13.790 --> 00:19:16.790 align:middle line:84%
>> Bashar, thank you for being
with us this evening on behalf

00:19:16.790 --> 00:19:18.080 align:middle line:90%
of everybody in this room.

00:19:18.080 --> 00:19:19.010 align:middle line:90%
Thank you so much.

00:19:19.010 --> 00:19:23.140 align:middle line:84%
>> It is our passion
and our pleasure.

00:19:23.140 --> 00:19:28.690 align:middle line:10%
>> I want to ask one thing for
everybody here this evening,

00:19:28.690 --> 00:19:34.300 align:middle line:10%
which is the year 2020 may
just be a symbolic number.

00:19:34.300 --> 00:19:38.050 align:middle line:10%
It is the number of our
year on this planet,

00:19:38.050 --> 00:19:45.330 align:middle line:10%
but we've put a lot of hope and
emotion into this year of 2020.

00:19:45.330 --> 00:19:49.650 align:middle line:84%
Should we worry
about what 2020 is,

00:19:49.650 --> 00:19:53.430 align:middle line:84%
or is this the time
that this planet

00:19:53.430 --> 00:19:58.450 align:middle line:84%
starts to grow up, mature,
and actually love each other?

00:19:58.450 --> 00:20:00.070 align:middle line:90%
>> We will say this.

00:20:00.070 --> 00:20:01.180 align:middle line:90%
Do you prefer to worry?

00:20:01.180 --> 00:20:03.410 align:middle line:90%
[AUDIENCE LAUGHTER]

00:20:03.410 --> 00:20:04.750 align:middle line:90%


00:20:04.750 --> 00:20:08.050 align:middle line:84%
Your year of 2020
is a pivot point,

00:20:08.050 --> 00:20:12.730 align:middle line:84%
an extremely crucial energetic
pivot point symbolized

00:20:12.730 --> 00:20:14.920 align:middle line:90%
by the very year itself.

00:20:14.920 --> 00:20:21.090 align:middle line:84%
You use that idea to say, I
have clear 20/20 vision forward,

00:20:21.090 --> 00:20:24.450 align:middle line:90%
but also hindsight is 20/20.

00:20:24.450 --> 00:20:27.930 align:middle line:84%
So you're right in the middle
of being clear about what

00:20:27.930 --> 00:20:30.780 align:middle line:84%
it is you can choose
to move forward on

00:20:30.780 --> 00:20:33.030 align:middle line:84%
and what it is you
wish to bring with you

00:20:33.030 --> 00:20:35.910 align:middle line:90%
and what it is you do not.

00:20:35.910 --> 00:20:40.020 align:middle line:84%
This is the pivot point,
right now, energetically.

00:20:40.020 --> 00:20:43.170 align:middle line:10%
So choose to align with
the vibrations you choose

00:20:43.170 --> 00:20:47.130 align:middle line:10%
to align with, and
take the actions that

00:20:47.130 --> 00:20:51.270 align:middle line:10%
are indicative of the kind of
actions you would take if you

00:20:51.270 --> 00:20:53.760 align:middle line:10%
were already living in
the version of Earth

00:20:53.760 --> 00:20:57.380 align:middle line:10%
that you prefer,
because remember,

00:20:57.380 --> 00:20:59.600 align:middle line:10%
while the higher
mind may communicate

00:20:59.600 --> 00:21:02.000 align:middle line:10%
with you through energy
that your body translates

00:21:02.000 --> 00:21:06.050 align:middle line:10%
as the sensation of
passion, your physical mind

00:21:06.050 --> 00:21:09.710 align:middle line:10%
and your physical body
have to speak the language

00:21:09.710 --> 00:21:11.180 align:middle line:10%
of physical reality.

00:21:11.180 --> 00:21:14.210 align:middle line:84%
And the language of physical
reality isn't words.

00:21:14.210 --> 00:21:16.290 align:middle line:90%
It's actions.

00:21:16.290 --> 00:21:19.280 align:middle line:84%
So when you take the
actions on your passion,

00:21:19.280 --> 00:21:22.790 align:middle line:84%
that the higher mind is
saying, this is you, act on it,

00:21:22.790 --> 00:21:25.520 align:middle line:84%
now, when you take
the action, you're

00:21:25.520 --> 00:21:27.110 align:middle line:84%
actually then
answering the higher

00:21:27.110 --> 00:21:31.250 align:middle line:84%
mind in the language of physical
reality that says, I heard you.

00:21:31.250 --> 00:21:33.410 align:middle line:10%
And therefore, because
the higher mind says,

00:21:33.410 --> 00:21:35.570 align:middle line:10%
all right, you heard
me, so I will send you

00:21:35.570 --> 00:21:38.690 align:middle line:10%
more opportunities
to live your passion.

00:21:38.690 --> 00:21:40.190 align:middle line:84%
And then if you
keep acting on them,

00:21:40.190 --> 00:21:42.960 align:middle line:84%
you build that dialogue,
you build that cycle,

00:21:42.960 --> 00:21:44.600 align:middle line:90%
it continues to expand.

00:21:44.600 --> 00:21:47.648 align:middle line:84%
But if you don't take
physical action on the passion

00:21:47.648 --> 00:21:49.190 align:middle line:84%
you've already been
given, why should

00:21:49.190 --> 00:21:51.350 align:middle line:84%
your higher mind send
you more opportunities

00:21:51.350 --> 00:21:53.767 align:middle line:84%
to act on it when you're not
acting on what you've already

00:21:53.767 --> 00:21:54.720 align:middle line:90%
been given?

00:21:54.720 --> 00:21:56.870 align:middle line:84%
So the idea is to
take the actions that

00:21:56.870 --> 00:22:00.620 align:middle line:84%
are representative of
the world that you prefer

00:22:00.620 --> 00:22:03.230 align:middle line:84%
in the most positive
constructive way you can,

00:22:03.230 --> 00:22:05.510 align:middle line:84%
using the opportunities
that have been provided

00:22:05.510 --> 00:22:08.240 align:middle line:84%
for you to make your statements
in whatever way, shape,

00:22:08.240 --> 00:22:11.420 align:middle line:84%
or form that works in
your particular culture,

00:22:11.420 --> 00:22:14.030 align:middle line:84%
but take those actions
to the best you can

00:22:14.030 --> 00:22:16.140 align:middle line:90%
because this is the pivot point.

00:22:16.140 --> 00:22:19.700 align:middle line:84%
So from this point forward,
the thing that will accelerate

00:22:19.700 --> 00:22:23.160 align:middle line:84%
is what pathway, what
world, what version of Earth

00:22:23.160 --> 00:22:25.160 align:middle line:84%
you're ultimately
going to experience

00:22:25.160 --> 00:22:28.220 align:middle line:84%
that is in alignment with
the positive state of being

00:22:28.220 --> 00:22:32.515 align:middle line:84%
and actions you choose to
take in this year of 2020.

00:22:32.515 --> 00:22:33.390 align:middle line:90%
>> Thank you, Bashar.

00:22:33.390 --> 00:22:35.730 align:middle line:84%
You just made us all just
a little bit smarter.

00:22:35.730 --> 00:22:36.530 align:middle line:90%
>> No.

00:22:36.530 --> 00:22:37.405 align:middle line:90%
>> Thank you so much.

00:22:37.405 --> 00:22:39.980 align:middle line:10%
>> We have given you information
that you can use to make

00:22:39.980 --> 00:22:41.445 align:middle line:10%
yourselves smarter.

00:22:41.445 --> 00:22:42.320 align:middle line:90%
>> Thank you, Bashar.

00:22:42.320 --> 00:22:44.745 align:middle line:90%
[APPLAUSE]

00:22:44.745 --> 00:22:48.150 align:middle line:90%


00:22:48.150 --> 00:22:49.420 align:middle line:90%
>> Great rising, Bashar.

00:22:49.420 --> 00:22:50.750 align:middle line:90%
>> And to you, good day.

00:22:50.750 --> 00:22:52.090 align:middle line:90%
>> It's enchanting to be here.

00:22:52.090 --> 00:22:53.300 align:middle line:90%
I'm very excited.

00:22:53.300 --> 00:22:56.720 align:middle line:84%
I wanted to talk a little bit
about my life and some things

00:22:56.720 --> 00:23:01.130 align:middle line:84%
I've experienced to help give
light to other people here.

00:23:01.130 --> 00:23:03.360 align:middle line:90%
So when I was a little girl--

00:23:03.360 --> 00:23:04.160 align:middle line:90%
>> Last week.

00:23:04.160 --> 00:23:06.480 align:middle line:10%
[AUDIENCE LAUGHTER]

00:23:06.480 --> 00:23:08.540 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, this is--
you'll love this story.

00:23:08.540 --> 00:23:09.510 align:middle line:90%
It's beautiful.

00:23:09.510 --> 00:23:12.800 align:middle line:84%
So I was born in
Lebanon in Oregon,

00:23:12.800 --> 00:23:14.810 align:middle line:84%
and two years after
that I actually

00:23:14.810 --> 00:23:19.490 align:middle line:84%
moved to to Santa Claus
Lane, North Pole Alaska.

00:23:19.490 --> 00:23:21.770 align:middle line:84%
And my parents called me
princess when I lived there.

00:23:21.770 --> 00:23:23.730 align:middle line:84%
So I lived as a princess
as a little girl.

00:23:23.730 --> 00:23:24.530 align:middle line:90%
>> All right.

00:23:24.530 --> 00:23:28.070 align:middle line:90%
An ice princess?

00:23:28.070 --> 00:23:29.340 align:middle line:90%
>> That's very on point.

00:23:29.340 --> 00:23:30.770 align:middle line:90%
That's beautiful.

00:23:30.770 --> 00:23:31.760 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:23:31.760 --> 00:23:33.860 align:middle line:84%
So I was told that
four years old

00:23:33.860 --> 00:23:36.170 align:middle line:84%
that I was a singer by my
mom, whose name is Candy.

00:23:36.170 --> 00:23:38.950 align:middle line:90%
That's why I'm so sweet.

00:23:38.950 --> 00:23:41.450 align:middle line:84%
And so I was singing
"Twinkle, Twinkle Little

00:23:41.450 --> 00:23:44.010 align:middle line:90%
Star" when she told me that.

00:23:44.010 --> 00:23:46.320 align:middle line:84%
And so from the moment
forward, I knew I was a singer.

00:23:46.320 --> 00:23:48.112 align:middle line:84%
And so I grew up to be
a singer songwriter.

00:23:48.112 --> 00:23:49.340 align:middle line:90%
>> All right.

00:23:49.340 --> 00:23:51.950 align:middle line:84%
That is representative of
your passion to some degree?

00:23:51.950 --> 00:23:52.940 align:middle line:90%
>> Absolutely.

00:23:52.940 --> 00:23:58.010 align:middle line:84%
And I actually have a cat I
named Passion that I manifested

00:23:58.010 --> 00:23:59.120 align:middle line:90%
over this past year.

00:23:59.120 --> 00:23:59.920 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:23:59.920 --> 00:24:01.520 align:middle line:90%
>> And he has a little sister.

00:24:01.520 --> 00:24:02.320 align:middle line:90%
Her name is Angel.

00:24:02.320 --> 00:24:04.330 align:middle line:84%
So I have Passion
and Angel at home.

00:24:04.330 --> 00:24:05.400 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:24:05.400 --> 00:24:07.850 align:middle line:84%
I choose to live in a
only positive state.

00:24:07.850 --> 00:24:10.680 align:middle line:84%
I only let positive energy
come into my mind frame.

00:24:10.680 --> 00:24:11.480 align:middle line:90%
>> Uh-uh.

00:24:11.480 --> 00:24:12.280 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:24:12.280 --> 00:24:13.880 align:middle line:90%
>> I know what you mean by that.

00:24:13.880 --> 00:24:14.700 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:24:14.700 --> 00:24:17.200 align:middle line:84%
>> But please understand that
a lot of people on your planet

00:24:17.200 --> 00:24:19.370 align:middle line:84%
have a big misunderstanding
about that idea.

00:24:19.370 --> 00:24:20.360 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:24:20.360 --> 00:24:22.880 align:middle line:84%
>> As you expand
your consciousness,

00:24:22.880 --> 00:24:25.890 align:middle line:84%
you may experience the
negative side less,

00:24:25.890 --> 00:24:28.610 align:middle line:84%
but you actually become
more aware of it.

00:24:28.610 --> 00:24:29.550 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes, that's true.

00:24:29.550 --> 00:24:29.900 align:middle line:90%
>> You understand?

00:24:29.900 --> 00:24:30.620 align:middle line:90%
>> Absolutely.

00:24:30.620 --> 00:24:31.420 align:middle line:90%
>> All right.

00:24:31.420 --> 00:24:35.270 align:middle line:84%
So just becoming aware of
more of the negative choices

00:24:35.270 --> 00:24:38.350 align:middle line:84%
doesn't affect you unless
you choose to align with it.

00:24:38.350 --> 00:24:39.150 align:middle line:90%
>> Correct.

00:24:39.150 --> 00:24:39.440 align:middle line:90%
>> All right.

00:24:39.440 --> 00:24:39.800 align:middle line:90%
>> Correct.

00:24:39.800 --> 00:24:42.140 align:middle line:84%
>> Just want to make sure
that that's what you meant.

00:24:42.140 --> 00:24:44.120 align:middle line:84%
>> I choose to align
with positive energy.

00:24:44.120 --> 00:24:44.920 align:middle line:90%
>> All right.

00:24:44.920 --> 00:24:47.220 align:middle line:84%
But don't invalidate
the negative choices.

00:24:47.220 --> 00:24:48.020 align:middle line:90%
>> Absolutely.

00:24:48.020 --> 00:24:49.640 align:middle line:90%
I recognize negative.

00:24:49.640 --> 00:24:51.450 align:middle line:84%
Yes, has to have the
balance between both.

00:24:51.450 --> 00:24:52.250 align:middle line:90%
>> Exactly.

00:24:52.250 --> 00:24:53.050 align:middle line:90%
>> Exactly.

00:24:53.050 --> 00:24:54.980 align:middle line:84%
Yin and yang, my two
yin and yang kittens.

00:24:54.980 --> 00:24:56.330 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:24:56.330 --> 00:24:59.300 align:middle line:84%
So I grew up a couple years
ago, I rewrote "Twinkle, Twinkle

00:24:59.300 --> 00:25:01.640 align:middle line:84%
Little Star," and
this year, I do plan

00:25:01.640 --> 00:25:03.690 align:middle line:90%
on releasing that music as well.

00:25:03.690 --> 00:25:05.190 align:middle line:90%
So very exciting.

00:25:05.190 --> 00:25:07.610 align:middle line:84%
I just want to say thank
you, Bashar, because I

00:25:07.610 --> 00:25:09.890 align:middle line:84%
feel I connected with you
before I even heard who you

00:25:09.890 --> 00:25:12.380 align:middle line:90%
were when I first moved to LA.

00:25:12.380 --> 00:25:15.890 align:middle line:84%
I was asking the universe, can I
please receive more information

00:25:15.890 --> 00:25:19.440 align:middle line:84%
to become the highest version
of myself I possibly can,

00:25:19.440 --> 00:25:21.680 align:middle line:84%
and I started seeing more
synchronicities in numbers

00:25:21.680 --> 00:25:22.480 align:middle line:90%
and realizing--

00:25:22.480 --> 00:25:23.300 align:middle line:90%
>> That's what happens.

00:25:23.300 --> 00:25:23.800 align:middle line:90%
>> Exactly.

00:25:23.800 --> 00:25:24.600 align:middle line:90%
It was amazing.

00:25:24.600 --> 00:25:27.480 align:middle line:84%
It was life changing
and seeing what

00:25:27.480 --> 00:25:30.500 align:middle line:84%
the numbers mean and letters
and why everything is placed--

00:25:30.500 --> 00:25:34.250 align:middle line:84%
>> Yes, but remember,
that wasn't life changing.

00:25:34.250 --> 00:25:36.500 align:middle line:84%
You changed your
life, and that's

00:25:36.500 --> 00:25:37.850 align:middle line:90%
why you had the experience.

00:25:37.850 --> 00:25:38.930 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes, that's true.

00:25:38.930 --> 00:25:41.720 align:middle line:84%
I had to put that energy
out in order to receive it.

00:25:41.720 --> 00:25:44.210 align:middle line:84%
>> Because you cannot perceive
what you're not the energy

00:25:44.210 --> 00:25:45.230 align:middle line:90%
of first.

00:25:45.230 --> 00:25:46.920 align:middle line:90%
>> Right, absolutely.

00:25:46.920 --> 00:25:47.720 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

00:25:47.720 --> 00:25:51.650 align:middle line:84%
So I'm very excited for
2020, perfect vision

00:25:51.650 --> 00:25:52.580 align:middle line:90%
like you did say.

00:25:52.580 --> 00:25:55.190 align:middle line:84%
>> that's a thing, since
you're already in it.

00:25:55.190 --> 00:25:56.780 align:middle line:84%
>> We are, we're
here, we made it.

00:25:56.780 --> 00:25:57.980 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:25:57.980 --> 00:26:02.280 align:middle line:84%
So one question I have for
you, my birthday is January 3.

00:26:02.280 --> 00:26:03.080 align:middle line:90%
>> All right.

00:26:03.080 --> 00:26:06.320 align:middle line:84%
>> And on my birthday, I
was at my sister's house,

00:26:06.320 --> 00:26:11.580 align:middle line:84%
and I felt a huge spiritual
awakening at about 3:00 AM

00:26:11.580 --> 00:26:12.380 align:middle line:90%
exactly.

00:26:12.380 --> 00:26:14.030 align:middle line:90%
It would be going January 4.

00:26:14.030 --> 00:26:17.010 align:middle line:84%
So it was that night
of my birthday.

00:26:17.010 --> 00:26:20.810 align:middle line:84%
May you tap into
that energetic moment

00:26:20.810 --> 00:26:24.200 align:middle line:90%
of 3:00 AM January 4 of 2020?

00:26:24.200 --> 00:26:28.070 align:middle line:84%
>> This is a very typical frame
on your planet that represents

00:26:28.070 --> 00:26:31.250 align:middle line:84%
the idea of the overlap of
different dimensionalities.

00:26:31.250 --> 00:26:33.050 align:middle line:10%
Sometimes people on
your planet express it

00:26:33.050 --> 00:26:36.140 align:middle line:10%
as the barriers between
the different dimensions

00:26:36.140 --> 00:26:39.050 align:middle line:10%
and realities are thinner
between 3:00 and 4:00

00:26:39.050 --> 00:26:42.200 align:middle line:10%
AM as part of the energetic
cycle of your planet.

00:26:42.200 --> 00:26:45.140 align:middle line:10%
And therefore, it's easier to
be in touch with and receive

00:26:45.140 --> 00:26:47.810 align:middle line:10%
communication from
different kinds of spirit

00:26:47.810 --> 00:26:50.690 align:middle line:10%
guides, different kinds of extra
dimensional or extraterrestrial

00:26:50.690 --> 00:26:54.855 align:middle line:10%
beings, because it is designed
for the purpose of allowing

00:26:54.855 --> 00:26:56.480 align:middle line:10%
there to be a little
bit more blending,

00:26:56.480 --> 00:26:59.450 align:middle line:10%
a little less separation
between what you typically

00:26:59.450 --> 00:27:02.780 align:middle line:10%
consider a different
reality from your own.

00:27:02.780 --> 00:27:05.780 align:middle line:10%
Therefore, there were those
kinds of connections made,

00:27:05.780 --> 00:27:09.350 align:middle line:10%
those kinds of contacts
made, those kinds of messages

00:27:09.350 --> 00:27:12.070 align:middle line:10%
given and downloads
given during that time.

00:27:12.070 --> 00:27:13.760 align:middle line:84%
You're just becoming
more aware of it

00:27:13.760 --> 00:27:17.180 align:middle line:84%
because as you increase the
vibration of your own energy,

00:27:17.180 --> 00:27:20.630 align:middle line:84%
as you raise your frequency,
you literally all become

00:27:20.630 --> 00:27:23.840 align:middle line:84%
a more sensitive antenna
to receive higher frequency

00:27:23.840 --> 00:27:25.700 align:middle line:90%
messages and information.

00:27:25.700 --> 00:27:27.440 align:middle line:84%
What was heretofore
invisible, what

00:27:27.440 --> 00:27:30.500 align:middle line:84%
was heretofore inaudible
to you will become visible,

00:27:30.500 --> 00:27:33.170 align:middle line:84%
will become audible
as you become

00:27:33.170 --> 00:27:35.330 align:middle line:90%
a more sensitive receiver.

00:27:35.330 --> 00:27:36.410 align:middle line:10%
>> Beautiful.

00:27:36.410 --> 00:27:37.210 align:middle line:90%
That's amazing.

00:27:37.210 --> 00:27:38.060 align:middle line:90%
Thank you for that.

00:27:38.060 --> 00:27:38.690 align:middle line:90%
>> You are welcome.

00:27:38.690 --> 00:27:39.500 align:middle line:90%
Happy birthday.

00:27:39.500 --> 00:27:40.370 align:middle line:90%
>> Thank you.

00:27:40.370 --> 00:27:42.650 align:middle line:90%
Happy birthday.

00:27:42.650 --> 00:27:46.020 align:middle line:84%
So I think one thing I just
want to say out loud here

00:27:46.020 --> 00:27:49.080 align:middle line:84%
would be my biggest
manifestation would

00:27:49.080 --> 00:27:52.530 align:middle line:84%
be to help my story be heard
by all around the world

00:27:52.530 --> 00:27:56.050 align:middle line:84%
because if you can believe
in my story, which is true,

00:27:56.050 --> 00:27:58.050 align:middle line:84%
then you can believe in
anything to be possible.

00:27:58.050 --> 00:27:58.850 align:middle line:90%
>> All right.

00:27:58.850 --> 00:28:04.210 align:middle line:10%
But again, remember, if your
passion is to share, share it.

00:28:04.210 --> 00:28:08.530 align:middle line:84%
What people do or don't do
with it, none of your business.

00:28:08.530 --> 00:28:09.400 align:middle line:90%
>> Absolutely.

00:28:09.400 --> 00:28:09.850 align:middle line:90%
>> All right?

00:28:09.850 --> 00:28:11.475 align:middle line:10%
>> It'll resonate
with who it needs to.

00:28:11.475 --> 00:28:13.990 align:middle line:10%
>> Because it's not about you
having the condition that they

00:28:13.990 --> 00:28:15.820 align:middle line:10%
must hear it.

00:28:15.820 --> 00:28:17.710 align:middle line:84%
It's about doing
it for its own sake

00:28:17.710 --> 00:28:21.010 align:middle line:84%
because it's your
passion, no other reason.

00:28:21.010 --> 00:28:25.120 align:middle line:84%
We give you and share with you
all these ideas, informations,

00:28:25.120 --> 00:28:28.630 align:middle line:84%
and perspectives, because it
is our passion and our pleasure

00:28:28.630 --> 00:28:29.770 align:middle line:90%
to do so.

00:28:29.770 --> 00:28:32.530 align:middle line:84%
What you do with it is
none of our business.

00:28:32.530 --> 00:28:33.400 align:middle line:90%
>> Beautiful.

00:28:33.400 --> 00:28:33.940 align:middle line:90%
>> All right?

00:28:33.940 --> 00:28:34.360 align:middle line:90%
>> Awesome.

00:28:34.360 --> 00:28:35.470 align:middle line:90%
So my goal is to connect.

00:28:35.470 --> 00:28:36.270 align:middle line:90%
>> Thank you.

00:28:36.270 --> 00:28:37.700 align:middle line:90%
>> Not a goal.

00:28:37.700 --> 00:28:39.130 align:middle line:90%
You see what I'm saying.

00:28:39.130 --> 00:28:41.660 align:middle line:90%
Don't make it conditional.

00:28:41.660 --> 00:28:43.100 align:middle line:90%
Bring it into the present.

00:28:43.100 --> 00:28:45.680 align:middle line:90%
You're just doing what you do.

00:28:45.680 --> 00:28:46.530 align:middle line:90%
That's it's.

00:28:46.530 --> 00:28:47.330 align:middle line:90%
>> Beautiful.

00:28:47.330 --> 00:28:50.600 align:middle line:84%
>> It will have the
impact it needs to have.

00:28:50.600 --> 00:28:52.550 align:middle line:84%
You don't even have to
know what impact it's

00:28:52.550 --> 00:28:56.450 align:middle line:84%
having to know that it's having
impact for no other reason

00:28:56.450 --> 00:28:58.850 align:middle line:84%
other than it's something
you wish to share.

00:28:58.850 --> 00:29:01.520 align:middle line:84%
This goes hand-in-hand
with the concept we call

00:29:01.520 --> 00:29:03.373 align:middle line:90%
there are no one-sided coins.

00:29:03.373 --> 00:29:04.790 align:middle line:10%
Have you heard us
talk about this?

00:29:04.790 --> 00:29:05.980 align:middle line:90%
>> Mm-hmm.

00:29:05.980 --> 00:29:08.420 align:middle line:84%
>> The idea is that if you
have a coin, you have the head.

00:29:08.420 --> 00:29:11.150 align:middle line:84%
If you have the head, you
have to have the tail.

00:29:11.150 --> 00:29:12.500 align:middle line:90%
Otherwise, there's no coin.

00:29:12.500 --> 00:29:17.760 align:middle line:84%
So if any of you truly
have a gift to give,

00:29:17.760 --> 00:29:21.090 align:middle line:84%
there has to be someone
waiting to receive it,

00:29:21.090 --> 00:29:23.220 align:middle line:84%
or you wouldn't be
excited about giving it

00:29:23.220 --> 00:29:25.170 align:middle line:90%
because there'd be no point.

00:29:25.170 --> 00:29:27.300 align:middle line:90%
There would be no coin.

00:29:27.300 --> 00:29:29.490 align:middle line:90%
So just give it.

00:29:29.490 --> 00:29:32.370 align:middle line:84%
Whether you know
it or not, someone

00:29:32.370 --> 00:29:36.100 align:middle line:84%
is waiting to receive it, and
that's all you have to know.

00:29:36.100 --> 00:29:36.900 align:middle line:90%
>> Amazing.

00:29:36.900 --> 00:29:37.980 align:middle line:90%
Well, thank you, Bashar.

00:29:37.980 --> 00:29:38.850 align:middle line:90%
>> You are most welcome.

00:29:38.850 --> 00:29:40.380 align:middle line:84%
>> Amazing to meet you
and everyone else here.

00:29:40.380 --> 00:29:41.180 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:29:41.180 --> 00:29:43.285 align:middle line:90%
[APPLAUSE]

00:29:43.285 --> 00:29:46.770 align:middle line:90%


00:29:46.770 --> 00:29:51.270 align:middle line:84%
>> Oh, how wonderful that you
are applauding for yourselves.

00:29:51.270 --> 00:29:52.070 align:middle line:90%
>> Hi there.

00:29:52.070 --> 00:29:53.130 align:middle line:90%
>> And to you, good day.

00:29:53.130 --> 00:29:53.930 align:middle line:90%
>> Hello.

00:29:53.930 --> 00:29:56.250 align:middle line:84%
My name is Brittany,
and I go by Britlin.

00:29:56.250 --> 00:29:57.210 align:middle line:90%
>> If you insist.

00:29:57.210 --> 00:30:01.870 align:middle line:84%
>> So I think it's fascinating
that she was up here

00:30:01.870 --> 00:30:03.630 align:middle line:84%
and my heart is pounding
out of my chest.

00:30:03.630 --> 00:30:06.760 align:middle line:84%
I had no idea I was going to be
in this room just half an hour

00:30:06.760 --> 00:30:07.560 align:middle line:90%
ago.

00:30:07.560 --> 00:30:08.940 align:middle line:84%
>> Isn't synchronicity
wonderful?

00:30:08.940 --> 00:30:11.280 align:middle line:84%
>> So this is what I'm up here
to talk to you about right now.

00:30:11.280 --> 00:30:12.150 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:30:12.150 --> 00:30:13.990 align:middle line:90%
>> OK, so her--

00:30:13.990 --> 00:30:14.790 align:middle line:90%
what was your name?

00:30:14.790 --> 00:30:17.280 align:middle line:90%
Who was just up here?

00:30:17.280 --> 00:30:18.080 align:middle line:90%
Kayla.

00:30:18.080 --> 00:30:20.750 align:middle line:84%
So your mom's name was
Candy, and my parents

00:30:20.750 --> 00:30:24.110 align:middle line:84%
were going to name me Candice,
and instead my mom said,

00:30:24.110 --> 00:30:26.750 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to let my
sister, Charity, name me,

00:30:26.750 --> 00:30:29.810 align:middle line:84%
and she named me after
the singer, Brittany,

00:30:29.810 --> 00:30:33.800 align:middle line:84%
from Alvin and the Chipmunks,
Alvin's girlfriend Brittany.

00:30:33.800 --> 00:30:37.850 align:middle line:84%
And I'm a singer, and I have
her bratty, spicy personality.

00:30:37.850 --> 00:30:39.740 align:middle line:90%
I love that I'm named after her.

00:30:39.740 --> 00:30:42.260 align:middle line:84%
And your birthday
is on January 3.

00:30:42.260 --> 00:30:44.720 align:middle line:84%
So my mother passed
on January 3,

00:30:44.720 --> 00:30:47.210 align:middle line:84%
and that is what
made me know that I

00:30:47.210 --> 00:30:49.550 align:middle line:84%
had to come up here and ask
this question because it's

00:30:49.550 --> 00:30:51.140 align:middle line:90%
been boggling my mind.

00:30:51.140 --> 00:30:54.780 align:middle line:84%
This afternoon has been filled
with so much synchronicity.

00:30:54.780 --> 00:30:55.580 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:30:55.580 --> 00:30:58.190 align:middle line:90%
>> So I was a part of the--

00:30:58.190 --> 00:31:00.110 align:middle line:84%
not a part of, but
I was a witnessing

00:31:00.110 --> 00:31:06.986 align:middle line:84%
of the panel, the spiritual
healing panel, and I won a--

00:31:06.986 --> 00:31:11.710 align:middle line:84%
I won a healing session
with Sivananda at the end,

00:31:11.710 --> 00:31:15.490 align:middle line:84%
and I went upstairs and did
the healing in the hotel room,

00:31:15.490 --> 00:31:17.410 align:middle line:90%
and it was incredible.

00:31:17.410 --> 00:31:19.130 align:middle line:90%
It was incredibly synchronistic.

00:31:19.130 --> 00:31:19.930 align:middle line:90%
>> All right.

00:31:19.930 --> 00:31:21.770 align:middle line:84%
I think that's actually
quite credible.

[AUDIENCE LAUGHTER]

00:31:23.267 --> 00:31:24.730 align:middle line:90%


00:31:24.730 --> 00:31:28.060 align:middle line:84%
>> So the woman who opens the
door to the hotel room opens

00:31:28.060 --> 00:31:31.000 align:middle line:84%
it, and I see that
it's this card,

00:31:31.000 --> 00:31:34.090 align:middle line:84%
and it says it's
time to let me go,

00:31:34.090 --> 00:31:38.380 align:middle line:84%
and I actually have this
exact same hotel room key card

00:31:38.380 --> 00:31:41.350 align:middle line:84%
on my altar at home because
the night that my mother passed

00:31:41.350 --> 00:31:47.500 align:middle line:84%
away, we stayed at a Hilton,
and this was our key code

00:31:47.500 --> 00:31:49.930 align:middle line:90%
for our room that evening.

00:31:49.930 --> 00:31:52.540 align:middle line:84%
And it says, it's
time to let me go.

00:31:52.540 --> 00:31:55.510 align:middle line:84%
What a message to have
on a hotel card key.

00:31:55.510 --> 00:31:59.920 align:middle line:84%
Who has it's time to let
me go on a hotel card key?

00:31:59.920 --> 00:32:01.718 align:middle line:90%
>> Well, obviously, you do.

00:32:01.718 --> 00:32:03.723 align:middle line:90%
>> I do, I do.

00:32:03.723 --> 00:32:05.750 align:middle line:90%
And I sit with it every day.

00:32:05.750 --> 00:32:06.550 align:middle line:90%
>> Because--

00:32:06.550 --> 00:32:08.510 align:middle line:84%
>> She gave it to me
and I have to of them.

00:32:08.510 --> 00:32:12.550 align:middle line:90%
>> Because that's your key.

00:32:12.550 --> 00:32:13.350 align:middle line:90%
>> It is.

00:32:13.350 --> 00:32:15.040 align:middle line:90%
I know, it's my key.

00:32:15.040 --> 00:32:17.050 align:middle line:90%
So this is my question.

00:32:17.050 --> 00:32:20.650 align:middle line:84%
OK, I had such a profound
awakening in 2015,

00:32:20.650 --> 00:32:22.660 align:middle line:90%
and my life is this now.

00:32:22.660 --> 00:32:26.170 align:middle line:84%
It is profound synchronicity
at all moments,

00:32:26.170 --> 00:32:29.270 align:middle line:90%
and it's overwhelming.

00:32:29.270 --> 00:32:30.730 align:middle line:84%
I don't know how
to integrate it.

00:32:30.730 --> 00:32:31.890 align:middle line:90%
It's hard to integrate it.

00:32:31.890 --> 00:32:32.690 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, nonsense.

00:32:32.690 --> 00:32:35.250 align:middle line:90%
You're integrating it fine.

00:32:35.250 --> 00:32:37.600 align:middle line:90%
Just keep living your life.

00:32:37.600 --> 00:32:38.710 align:middle line:90%
What's to integrate?

00:32:38.710 --> 00:32:40.250 align:middle line:90%
>> It's just so big.

00:32:40.250 --> 00:32:41.050 align:middle line:90%
It's so--

00:32:41.050 --> 00:32:44.020 align:middle line:90%
>> And so are you.

00:32:44.020 --> 00:32:47.860 align:middle line:84%
That's how you integrate it by
understanding that what you are

00:32:47.860 --> 00:32:50.680 align:middle line:90%
given is equal to what you are.

00:32:50.680 --> 00:32:54.190 align:middle line:90%


00:32:54.190 --> 00:32:59.270 align:middle line:84%
Remember, physical reality
is nothing but a mirror.

00:32:59.270 --> 00:33:04.090 align:middle line:84%
So if it comes to you on
that scale, it's a message.

00:33:04.090 --> 00:33:06.760 align:middle line:84%
This is the scale
of your true self.

00:33:06.760 --> 00:33:11.110 align:middle line:84%
Just be who you truly are,
and this will be equal to

00:33:11.110 --> 00:33:14.110 align:middle line:90%
and you equal to it.

00:33:14.110 --> 00:33:17.740 align:middle line:84%
It will be automatic to know how
to incorporate it in your life,

00:33:17.740 --> 00:33:20.680 align:middle line:84%
because when you're in the
state of being yourself,

00:33:20.680 --> 00:33:25.160 align:middle line:84%
that knowledge
automatically comes with it.

00:33:25.160 --> 00:33:26.870 align:middle line:84%
Remember, you can't
experience what

00:33:26.870 --> 00:33:30.650 align:middle line:84%
you're not the vibration of
first, even thoughts, even

00:33:30.650 --> 00:33:31.820 align:middle line:90%
inspirations.

00:33:31.820 --> 00:33:33.320 align:middle line:84%
So when you allow
yourself to know

00:33:33.320 --> 00:33:37.170 align:middle line:84%
that that's a sign that you
are that big and accept it,

00:33:37.170 --> 00:33:40.590 align:middle line:84%
you will then have access
to the knowledge that

00:33:40.590 --> 00:33:44.375 align:middle line:84%
allows you to know how
it incorporates smoothly

00:33:44.375 --> 00:33:45.750 align:middle line:84%
into your life,
because remember,

00:33:45.750 --> 00:33:49.140 align:middle line:84%
when you're acting on your
passion, it opens up tools,

00:33:49.140 --> 00:33:51.600 align:middle line:90%
shall we say, in the kit.

00:33:51.600 --> 00:33:53.790 align:middle line:84%
It becomes the driving
engine of your life.

00:33:53.790 --> 00:33:56.820 align:middle line:84%
It becomes the organizing
principle of synchronicity.

00:33:56.820 --> 00:33:59.040 align:middle line:84%
It becomes what we're
talking about now,

00:33:59.040 --> 00:34:01.910 align:middle line:90%
the path of least resistance.

00:34:01.910 --> 00:34:03.210 align:middle line:90%
You flow.

00:34:03.210 --> 00:34:05.010 align:middle line:90%
You go with your flow.

00:34:05.010 --> 00:34:08.699 align:middle line:84%
Your current in creation
knows where you need to go.

00:34:08.699 --> 00:34:10.847 align:middle line:90%
Just flow with it.

00:34:10.847 --> 00:34:12.389 align:middle line:84%
It becomes the path
that connects you

00:34:12.389 --> 00:34:15.000 align:middle line:84%
to all relevant
expressions of excitement

00:34:15.000 --> 00:34:16.770 align:middle line:90%
and passion in your life.

00:34:16.770 --> 00:34:19.170 align:middle line:84%
It becomes the path
that supports you

00:34:19.170 --> 00:34:20.760 align:middle line:84%
in whatever form
of abundance you

00:34:20.760 --> 00:34:23.909 align:middle line:84%
need to be supported to keep
doing what you need to do

00:34:23.909 --> 00:34:25.150 align:middle line:90%
in line with your excitement.

00:34:25.150 --> 00:34:28.650 align:middle line:84%
It becomes the reflective mirror
that reveals to you anything

00:34:28.650 --> 00:34:31.889 align:middle line:84%
that might be within your belief
system that's out of alignment

00:34:31.889 --> 00:34:33.659 align:middle line:84%
with who you prefer
to be, so you

00:34:33.659 --> 00:34:37.020 align:middle line:84%
can recognize it and
let it go and add

00:34:37.020 --> 00:34:38.940 align:middle line:90%
that energy to your momentum.

00:34:38.940 --> 00:34:42.929 align:middle line:84%
And it leaves
nothing relevant out.

00:34:42.929 --> 00:34:45.989 align:middle line:90%
It's a complete, holistic hit.

00:34:45.989 --> 00:34:48.510 align:middle line:90%
It unfolds automatically.

00:34:48.510 --> 00:34:50.580 align:middle line:90%
It guides you perfectly.

00:34:50.580 --> 00:34:53.190 align:middle line:84%
You just need to
go with the flow

00:34:53.190 --> 00:34:55.350 align:middle line:84%
by following the formula
that we've given you,

00:34:55.350 --> 00:34:57.930 align:middle line:84%
the instruction manual
for how life works.

00:34:57.930 --> 00:35:00.870 align:middle line:84%
Act on your highest passion
every moment that you can.

00:35:00.870 --> 00:35:02.940 align:middle line:84%
Do it to the best you
can, taking it as far

00:35:02.940 --> 00:35:05.650 align:middle line:84%
as you can til you can
take it no further.

00:35:05.650 --> 00:35:08.800 align:middle line:84%
Do it with no insistence,
no assumption whatsoever

00:35:08.800 --> 00:35:11.290 align:middle line:84%
on what the outcome
is supposed to be.

00:35:11.290 --> 00:35:13.210 align:middle line:84%
Stay in a positive
state, no matter what

00:35:13.210 --> 00:35:15.880 align:middle line:84%
manifests, because whatever
it is that manifest

00:35:15.880 --> 00:35:18.050 align:middle line:84%
has got to be
there for a reason.

00:35:18.050 --> 00:35:21.970 align:middle line:84%
Even if it's something that
you objectively don't prefer,

00:35:21.970 --> 00:35:25.530 align:middle line:84%
it's got to have manifested for
a reason that could serve you,

00:35:25.530 --> 00:35:28.030 align:middle line:84%
and the only way you're going
to know how it could serve you

00:35:28.030 --> 00:35:30.293 align:middle line:84%
by being there is to
stay in a positive state

00:35:30.293 --> 00:35:31.960 align:middle line:84%
because if you go
into a negative state,

00:35:31.960 --> 00:35:35.330 align:middle line:84%
you will never know how it
could positively serve you.

00:35:35.330 --> 00:35:37.960 align:middle line:10%
So the idea is that
if nothing else,

00:35:37.960 --> 00:35:40.300 align:middle line:10%
manifesting something
you don't prefer

00:35:40.300 --> 00:35:42.610 align:middle line:10%
gives you a much clearer
picture by contrast

00:35:42.610 --> 00:35:44.410 align:middle line:10%
of what you do prefer.

00:35:44.410 --> 00:35:47.890 align:middle line:10%
And that's a way to use what
you don't prefer in a way

00:35:47.890 --> 00:35:50.530 align:middle line:10%
that you prefer, and
then you've used it up,

00:35:50.530 --> 00:35:52.240 align:middle line:10%
and it doesn't have
to stick around

00:35:52.240 --> 00:35:55.780 align:middle line:10%
because you understood how
to use it to your benefit,

00:35:55.780 --> 00:35:57.820 align:middle line:10%
instead of to your detriment.

00:35:57.820 --> 00:35:58.960 align:middle line:10%
Is this making sense?

00:35:58.960 --> 00:35:59.350 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:35:59.350 --> 00:36:00.360 align:middle line:90%
>> Is this helping you?

00:36:00.360 --> 00:36:01.290 align:middle line:90%
>> So much.

00:36:01.290 --> 00:36:02.100 align:middle line:90%
>> All right.

00:36:02.100 --> 00:36:02.900 align:middle line:90%
>> Thank you.

00:36:02.900 --> 00:36:04.180 align:middle line:90%
>> You are doing fine.

00:36:04.180 --> 00:36:05.350 align:middle line:90%
Relax.

00:36:05.350 --> 00:36:06.910 align:middle line:90%
>> It's so-- and I love it.

00:36:06.910 --> 00:36:08.120 align:middle line:90%
I love experiencing it.

00:36:08.120 --> 00:36:08.920 align:middle line:90%
It's so exciting.

00:36:08.920 --> 00:36:13.772 align:middle line:84%
>> Then just keep loving it
and keep loving yourself.

00:36:13.772 --> 00:36:14.700 align:middle line:90%
>> Thank you.

00:36:14.700 --> 00:36:15.500 align:middle line:90%

So I'm here today, and I guess--

>> Yes, you are.

00:36:37.430 --> 00:36:41.320 align:middle line:84%

my story, I had this--

I call it an awakening and
June 9 of 2016, kind of--

>> Speak up.

00:36:46.290 --> 00:36:48.880 align:middle line:84%
Speak up so that all can
hear what you have to share.

00:36:48.880 --> 00:36:51.155 align:middle line:84%
>> It kind of rocked my
world, to say the least.

00:36:51.155 --> 00:36:56.240 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, wasn't that the
point of an awakening to rock

00:36:56.240 --> 00:36:58.010 align:middle line:90%
your world?

00:36:58.010 --> 00:37:00.860 align:middle line:84%
>> I guess where I'm going
with this is I feel like it was

00:37:00.860 --> 00:37:02.180 align:middle line:90%
a big gift to me.

00:37:02.180 --> 00:37:04.310 align:middle line:90%
>> It is.

00:37:04.310 --> 00:37:07.910 align:middle line:84%
>> I feel like I've gone back
and forth with the belief

00:37:07.910 --> 00:37:11.100 align:middle line:84%
of what it really was to me at
the time versus maybe what it

00:37:11.100 --> 00:37:11.900 align:middle line:90%
is now.

What is it now?

00:37:16.610 --> 00:37:20.540 align:middle line:84%
Does what it is
now work for you?

this state of bliss and maybe

ecstasy it brought and
what it felt like to me.

We understand.

00:37:31.450 --> 00:37:36.190 align:middle line:84%
You are going off that
typical human assumption

00:37:36.190 --> 00:37:40.240 align:middle line:84%
that every state of ecstasy
has to feel the same.

00:37:40.240 --> 00:37:41.110 align:middle line:90%
It doesn't.

00:37:41.110 --> 00:37:42.820 align:middle line:10%
You're a different person.

00:37:42.820 --> 00:37:44.920 align:middle line:84%
You can be in a
state of bliss that

00:37:44.920 --> 00:37:49.090 align:middle line:84%
is reflective of the state you
need to be in at that moment

00:37:49.090 --> 00:37:50.770 align:middle line:84%
to do what you
need to do, and it

00:37:50.770 --> 00:37:54.160 align:middle line:84%
doesn't have to feel like the
same state as the awakening.

00:37:54.160 --> 00:37:57.630 align:middle line:84%
You just have to
know that it is.

00:37:57.630 --> 00:38:00.420 align:middle line:84%
So don't make that
comparison or that contrast,

00:38:00.420 --> 00:38:03.540 align:middle line:84%
because it doesn't serve
you to make that comparison,

00:38:03.540 --> 00:38:05.430 align:middle line:84%
because it doesn't
allow you to experience

00:38:05.430 --> 00:38:07.230 align:middle line:84%
the idea that you
might, in fact, actually

00:38:07.230 --> 00:38:08.975 align:middle line:90%
be in the same state.

00:38:08.975 --> 00:38:11.350 align:middle line:84%
But if you're a different
person now than you used to be.

00:38:11.350 --> 00:38:13.330 align:middle line:90%
It's going to feel different.

00:38:13.330 --> 00:38:14.830 align:middle line:90%
And that's all right.

00:38:14.830 --> 00:38:22.090 align:middle line:84%
But let me give you, well,
a trick, a little secret.

00:38:22.090 --> 00:38:25.330 align:middle line:10%
Should we let them all in on it?

00:38:25.330 --> 00:38:26.200 align:middle line:90%
>> Let's do it.

00:38:26.200 --> 00:38:28.340 align:middle line:90%
>> All right.

00:38:28.340 --> 00:38:31.770 align:middle line:84%
Can you remember what it felt
like to be in that state?

00:38:31.770 --> 00:38:32.570 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:38:32.570 --> 00:38:33.570 align:middle line:90%
>> During the awakening.

00:38:33.570 --> 00:38:35.080 align:middle line:90%
All right.

00:38:35.080 --> 00:38:36.130 align:middle line:90%
Now, listen.

00:38:36.130 --> 00:38:39.910 align:middle line:84%
As soon as you remember
being in that state,

00:38:39.910 --> 00:38:43.960 align:middle line:84%
you're in that state, even
if it feels different.

00:38:43.960 --> 00:38:45.970 align:middle line:90%
And here's the real secret.

00:38:45.970 --> 00:38:48.610 align:middle line:84%
Remember when we said you can't
experience what you're not

00:38:48.610 --> 00:38:50.650 align:middle line:90%
the vibration of first?

00:38:50.650 --> 00:38:51.610 align:middle line:90%
You remember that?

00:38:51.610 --> 00:38:52.900 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:38:52.900 --> 00:38:54.640 align:middle line:90%
>> Here's the trick.

00:38:54.640 --> 00:38:59.350 align:middle line:84%
You actually have to already be
in that state to even remember

00:38:59.350 --> 00:39:00.905 align:middle line:90%
being in that state.

00:39:00.905 --> 00:39:03.960 align:middle line:90%


00:39:03.960 --> 00:39:07.310 align:middle line:84%
So the fact that you can
remember being in that state

00:39:07.310 --> 00:39:09.230 align:middle line:84%
means you're already
in the state,

00:39:09.230 --> 00:39:13.030 align:middle line:84%
to have been able to
remember being in that state.

00:39:13.030 --> 00:39:16.450 align:middle line:84%
Even if it feels different,
you're in that state, the state

00:39:16.450 --> 00:39:19.540 align:middle line:84%
that you need to be in
for who you are now.

00:39:19.540 --> 00:39:22.000 align:middle line:84%
All you need to do is know
that you're in that state

00:39:22.000 --> 00:39:24.700 align:middle line:84%
any time that you
remember what it felt like

00:39:24.700 --> 00:39:28.540 align:middle line:84%
and then move forward
and act from that state.

00:39:28.540 --> 00:39:31.170 align:middle line:90%
Doesn't have to feel identical.

00:39:31.170 --> 00:39:36.030 align:middle line:84%
Remember, your own zen monks say
you cannot step into the same

00:39:36.030 --> 00:39:37.440 align:middle line:90%
river twice.

00:39:37.440 --> 00:39:38.830 align:middle line:90%
It's always moving.

00:39:38.830 --> 00:39:40.350 align:middle line:90%
It's always different.

00:39:40.350 --> 00:39:42.900 align:middle line:84%
Just know that you're in
the proper state for what

00:39:42.900 --> 00:39:45.240 align:middle line:90%
you need to be at that moment.

00:39:45.240 --> 00:39:47.880 align:middle line:84%
Doesn't have to feel
the way it used to feel.

00:39:47.880 --> 00:39:48.780 align:middle line:90%
Is this helping?

00:39:48.780 --> 00:39:49.580 align:middle line:90%
>> This is.

00:39:49.580 --> 00:39:52.000 align:middle line:84%
Yes, and I have a lot of
conflict within myself

00:39:52.000 --> 00:39:52.800 align:middle line:90%
as far as--

00:39:52.800 --> 00:39:54.350 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, how exciting.

00:39:54.350 --> 00:39:59.860 align:middle line:84%
>> As far as not doing anything
maybe big with it and feeling

00:39:59.860 --> 00:40:00.660 align:middle line:90%
that I'm--

00:40:00.660 --> 00:40:02.830 align:middle line:90%
>> Who said you have to?

00:40:02.830 --> 00:40:06.250 align:middle line:84%
When we talk about the idea of
acting on your highest passion,

00:40:06.250 --> 00:40:08.860 align:middle line:90%
we don't necessarily mean--

00:40:08.860 --> 00:40:11.420 align:middle line:84%
though it could mean
this, depends on you.

00:40:11.420 --> 00:40:14.710 align:middle line:10%
We don't necessarily mean it
has to be some life consuming

00:40:14.710 --> 00:40:18.780 align:middle line:10%
project, some giant career move.

00:40:18.780 --> 00:40:19.740 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:40:19.740 --> 00:40:22.200 align:middle line:84%
It might build into
that maybe, but it

00:40:22.200 --> 00:40:25.050 align:middle line:84%
doesn't matter whether it
does or not, because all

00:40:25.050 --> 00:40:27.240 align:middle line:90%
we're actually saying--

00:40:27.240 --> 00:40:28.300 align:middle line:90%
are you paying attention?

00:40:28.300 --> 00:40:29.100 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:40:29.100 --> 00:40:32.760 align:middle line:84%
>> All we're actually saying
is at any given moment,

00:40:32.760 --> 00:40:34.990 align:middle line:84%
all of you have options
available to you,

00:40:34.990 --> 00:40:37.297 align:middle line:90%
every day options.

00:40:37.297 --> 00:40:38.130 align:middle line:90%
I could take a walk.

00:40:38.130 --> 00:40:38.850 align:middle line:90%
I could read a book.

00:40:38.850 --> 00:40:39.540 align:middle line:90%
I could have lunch.

00:40:39.540 --> 00:40:40.560 align:middle line:90%
I can talk to a friend.

00:40:40.560 --> 00:40:42.680 align:middle line:90%
I can see a movie.

00:40:42.680 --> 00:40:45.440 align:middle line:10%
Of whatever the options are
you have that are actually

00:40:45.440 --> 00:40:48.320 align:middle line:10%
available to you,
just pick the one

00:40:48.320 --> 00:40:51.950 align:middle line:10%
that has even the tiniest
bit more excitement

00:40:51.950 --> 00:40:55.730 align:middle line:10%
or attractiveness or curiosity
to it than any other choice

00:40:55.730 --> 00:40:58.670 align:middle line:10%
that you have an ability to
take some action on, and just

00:40:58.670 --> 00:41:01.610 align:middle line:10%
do that one first.

00:41:01.610 --> 00:41:03.090 align:middle line:90%
See where it leads.

00:41:03.090 --> 00:41:04.340 align:middle line:90%
No assumption.

00:41:04.340 --> 00:41:05.570 align:middle line:90%
No insistence.

00:41:05.570 --> 00:41:07.382 align:middle line:90%
Just see where it takes you.

00:41:07.382 --> 00:41:08.840 align:middle line:84%
And then when you
arrive at a point

00:41:08.840 --> 00:41:11.770 align:middle line:84%
where that seems
to disappear, look

00:41:11.770 --> 00:41:14.018 align:middle line:84%
for the next thing that
has more excitement, even

00:41:14.018 --> 00:41:16.060 align:middle line:84%
just a little bit more,
more attractiveness, more

00:41:16.060 --> 00:41:19.780 align:middle line:84%
curiosity in it, than any other
choice, and act on that one

00:41:19.780 --> 00:41:24.470 align:middle line:84%
next, and again and again
and again and again.

00:41:24.470 --> 00:41:26.980 align:middle line:84%
It may start to build
into something bigger.

00:41:26.980 --> 00:41:29.620 align:middle line:84%
It will lead you
into something else

00:41:29.620 --> 00:41:31.780 align:middle line:84%
that you need to be
led into if you need

00:41:31.780 --> 00:41:33.580 align:middle line:84%
to be led into
something as a bigger

00:41:33.580 --> 00:41:34.907 align:middle line:90%
expression of your excitement.

00:41:34.907 --> 00:41:36.490 align:middle line:84%
But the point is,
is it doesn't really

00:41:36.490 --> 00:41:38.620 align:middle line:84%
have to because if
you're always choosing

00:41:38.620 --> 00:41:40.755 align:middle line:84%
what is most exciting
out of all the options

00:41:40.755 --> 00:41:42.130 align:middle line:84%
that are available
to you, you're

00:41:42.130 --> 00:41:45.230 align:middle line:84%
still living a life of
excitement, aren't you?

00:41:45.230 --> 00:41:49.600 align:middle line:84%
So who cares what scale
it actually manifests on?

00:41:49.600 --> 00:41:52.450 align:middle line:90%
Remember, it's not conditional.

00:41:52.450 --> 00:41:54.760 align:middle line:84%
Your excitement is
not conditional.

00:41:54.760 --> 00:41:56.890 align:middle line:84%
Just be the state
you prefer to be,

00:41:56.890 --> 00:41:59.050 align:middle line:84%
not because of how
you think it should

00:41:59.050 --> 00:42:01.720 align:middle line:84%
be expressed, what you
think it will get you,

00:42:01.720 --> 00:42:03.610 align:middle line:84%
where you think it
should take you.

00:42:03.610 --> 00:42:06.640 align:middle line:84%
Just do it because
that's who you are.

00:42:06.640 --> 00:42:08.830 align:middle line:90%
This is more exciting than that.

00:42:08.830 --> 00:42:10.120 align:middle line:90%
What could be simpler?

00:42:10.120 --> 00:42:12.730 align:middle line:84%
If you find choices
that seem to be equal,

00:42:12.730 --> 00:42:14.980 align:middle line:84%
and you can't tell them
apart in terms of, well,

00:42:14.980 --> 00:42:18.070 align:middle line:84%
they're both equally exciting,
then ask the next question.

00:42:18.070 --> 00:42:20.980 align:middle line:84%
Do I have the same ability
to act on both of them?

00:42:20.980 --> 00:42:24.430 align:middle line:84%
If the answer is yes, then
you might as well flip a coin,

00:42:24.430 --> 00:42:27.693 align:middle line:84%
because the idea is, is you
may, number one, find out

00:42:27.693 --> 00:42:29.860 align:middle line:84%
that when you flip the coin,
say, all right, A, I'll

00:42:29.860 --> 00:42:33.520 align:middle line:84%
take this, B, I'll take
that, and it lands A,

00:42:33.520 --> 00:42:36.520 align:middle line:84%
you might find yourself going,
oh, darn, I wish it was B.

00:42:36.520 --> 00:42:40.000 align:middle line:90%
Oh, oh I wish it was B.

00:42:40.000 --> 00:42:42.700 align:middle line:84%
Now, if it turns
out that it really

00:42:42.700 --> 00:42:45.460 align:middle line:84%
doesn't feel like
there's any difference,

00:42:45.460 --> 00:42:47.952 align:middle line:84%
here's where the
tools come into play,

00:42:47.952 --> 00:42:49.660 align:middle line:84%
because if you just
say, all right, well,

00:42:49.660 --> 00:42:53.750 align:middle line:84%
I'll just start
acting on option A,

00:42:53.750 --> 00:42:56.900 align:middle line:84%
if that isn't the path
of least resistance,

00:42:56.900 --> 00:43:00.290 align:middle line:84%
remember that tool, the
tool of synchronicity

00:43:00.290 --> 00:43:05.210 align:middle line:84%
will go turn around,
and go back this way.

00:43:05.210 --> 00:43:08.690 align:middle line:90%
It's a self-guiding principle.

00:43:08.690 --> 00:43:13.550 align:middle line:84%
It's the organizing
principle of your life.

00:43:13.550 --> 00:43:15.320 align:middle line:10%
Follow it.

00:43:15.320 --> 00:43:17.040 align:middle line:90%
Is this helping?

00:43:17.040 --> 00:43:17.850 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:43:17.850 --> 00:43:19.770 align:middle line:90%
>> Are you sure?

00:43:19.770 --> 00:43:20.660 align:middle line:90%
>> I am.

00:43:20.660 --> 00:43:22.545 align:middle line:90%
>> All right.

00:43:22.545 --> 00:43:23.670 align:middle line:90%
Will that work for you now?

00:43:23.670 --> 00:43:25.080 align:middle line:90%
>> I think that works for me.

00:43:25.080 --> 00:43:26.580 align:middle line:90%
I appreciate your time.

00:43:26.580 --> 00:43:28.990 align:middle line:10%
>> It is absolutely our
passion and our pleasure.

00:43:28.990 --> 00:43:29.790 align:middle line:10%
>> Thank you.

00:43:29.790 --> 00:43:32.190 align:middle line:10%
[APPLAUSE]

00:43:32.190 --> 00:43:35.560 align:middle line:90%


00:43:35.560 --> 00:43:38.830 align:middle line:84%
>> Please all of you
understand, this literally is

00:43:38.830 --> 00:43:40.640 align:middle line:90%
an instruction manual.

00:43:40.640 --> 00:43:41.830 align:middle line:90%
It's not a philosophy.

00:43:41.830 --> 00:43:43.060 align:middle line:90%
It's not an opinion.

00:43:43.060 --> 00:43:45.310 align:middle line:84%
We're literally describing
the nature and structure

00:43:45.310 --> 00:43:47.510 align:middle line:90%
of how your reality works.

00:43:47.510 --> 00:43:49.360 align:middle line:84%
So if you just follow
the instructions

00:43:49.360 --> 00:43:51.550 align:middle line:84%
and understand the
tools and can simply

00:43:51.550 --> 00:43:54.250 align:middle line:84%
wrap your mind
around how they work,

00:43:54.250 --> 00:43:56.830 align:middle line:90%
everything works just perfectly.

00:43:56.830 --> 00:44:00.460 align:middle line:84%
Just use the instructions like
you would for any machine.

00:44:00.460 --> 00:44:02.260 align:middle line:84%
If you follow the
instructions, the machine

00:44:02.260 --> 00:44:05.000 align:middle line:84%
will work as it's designed
to work to your advantage.

00:44:05.000 --> 00:44:07.282 align:middle line:84%
If you don't, the
machine may still work,

00:44:07.282 --> 00:44:08.740 align:middle line:84%
but it may be to
your disadvantage,

00:44:08.740 --> 00:44:10.340 align:middle line:90%
or you may injure yourself.

00:44:10.340 --> 00:44:13.395 align:middle line:90%
So just follow the structure.

00:44:13.395 --> 00:44:14.270 align:middle line:10%
>> Greetings, Bashar.

00:44:14.270 --> 00:44:15.580 align:middle line:10%
>> And to you, good day.

00:44:15.580 --> 00:44:19.720 align:middle line:10%
>> So I've been following
the formula passionately,

00:44:19.720 --> 00:44:21.583 align:middle line:10%
and it's really been
accelerating for me.

00:44:21.583 --> 00:44:23.500 align:middle line:84%
>> Is there a but at the
end of that sentence?

00:44:23.500 --> 00:44:24.100 align:middle line:90%
>> No.

00:44:24.100 --> 00:44:24.900 align:middle line:90%
>> All right.

00:44:24.900 --> 00:44:25.770 align:middle line:10%
>> There is an and.

00:44:25.770 --> 00:44:26.570 align:middle line:10%
>> Oh, all right.

00:44:26.570 --> 00:44:30.602 align:middle line:10%
And, so you talk about you
can't perceive the reality

00:44:30.602 --> 00:44:31.810 align:middle line:10%
unless you're that vibration.

00:44:31.810 --> 00:44:32.860 align:middle line:10%
>> Yes.

00:44:32.860 --> 00:44:36.070 align:middle line:10%
>> So I've been really letting
go of the whole idea of victim

00:44:36.070 --> 00:44:40.300 align:middle line:10%
mentality and realizing nothing
can happen to me that's not

00:44:40.300 --> 00:44:42.160 align:middle line:10%
my choice, it's
not my reflection,

00:44:42.160 --> 00:44:44.110 align:middle line:10%
I didn't create
that on some level.

00:44:44.110 --> 00:44:47.890 align:middle line:10%
>> Yes, now, again, that idea

00:51:27.920 --> 00:51:30.200 align:middle line:84%
And then I felt something
land on my shoulder,

00:51:30.200 --> 00:51:33.280 align:middle line:84%
and it was like a big wasp,
because it was just humming.

00:51:33.280 --> 00:51:34.280 align:middle line:90%
But it was very large.

00:51:34.280 --> 00:51:35.240 align:middle line:90%
It landed on my--

00:51:35.240 --> 00:51:38.060 align:middle line:84%
I felt it on my
shoulder and my head.

00:51:38.060 --> 00:51:40.320 align:middle line:84%
And then I felt the
needle go into my head.

I was thinking,

00:51:44.930 --> 00:51:48.310 align:middle line:84%
I'm so glad I'm going to
go see Bashar, because I--

00:51:48.310 --> 00:51:49.860 align:middle line:84%
and I was awake
when it happened.

00:51:49.860 --> 00:51:50.660 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:51:50.660 --> 00:51:52.940 align:middle line:84%
>> But I didn't see
anything with my--

>> No, not with your eyes.

00:51:56.100 --> 00:51:56.900 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:51:56.900 --> 00:51:57.870 align:middle line:90%
>> But you sensed it.

00:51:57.870 --> 00:51:58.670 align:middle line:90%
>> I sensed it.

00:51:58.670 --> 00:52:03.320 align:middle line:10%

could quantify who it was or--

>> Well, you're part of
the hybridization agenda.

00:52:06.620 --> 00:52:10.880 align:middle line:10%
So the vibration is the
idea of a frequency field

that allows you to remain fixed
in a certain dimensional way

00:52:14.960 --> 00:52:17.540 align:middle line:10%

be done without disrupting

00:52:17.540 --> 00:52:21.270 align:middle line:10%

that certain energies can

exactly a needle per se.

>> OK.

00:52:37.850 --> 00:52:42.050 align:middle line:84%
>> It is more the idea of a very
concentrated focus of energy

00:52:42.050 --> 00:52:45.830 align:middle line:84%
that allows for certain kinds of
neurological changes to happen

00:52:45.830 --> 00:52:50.090 align:middle line:84%
in your brain pattern, so that
you can be more aware of more

So I wrote a book.

00:53:44.250 --> 00:53:46.980 align:middle line:84%
I wrote a trauma workbook,
and then I talked to an agent

00:53:46.980 --> 00:53:48.355 align:middle line:84%
about it, and she
said, you know,

00:53:48.355 --> 00:53:51.600 align:middle line:84%
you really need to write a
memoir to sell this book.

00:53:51.600 --> 00:53:55.470 align:middle line:84%

query an agent and
do submissions.

00:54:12.157 --> 00:54:12.957 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:54:12.957 --> 00:54:15.090 align:middle line:84%
>> So I came here tonight,
and I was in line,

00:54:15.090 --> 00:54:18.190 align:middle line:84%
and there was a guy standing in
front, and we started talking.

00:54:18.190 --> 00:54:20.200 align:middle line:84%
And he's a writer, and
he's querying agents.

00:54:21.000 --> 00:54:22.750 align:middle line:84%

talked to me about that.

00:57:37.240 --> 00:57:38.890 align:middle line:90%
That's your natural state.

00:57:38.890 --> 00:57:41.480 align:middle line:84%
You're just dreaming
that you've left.

00:57:41.480 --> 00:57:43.100 align:middle line:90%
That's what physical reality is.

00:57:43.100 --> 00:57:46.550 align:middle line:10%
You are in spirit right
now having a dream

00:57:46.550 --> 00:57:48.810 align:middle line:10%
that you're not in spirit.

00:57:48.810 --> 00:57:49.610 align:middle line:90%
>> Nice.

00:57:49.610 --> 00:57:52.400 align:middle line:84%
>> So you can connect more
strongly when you start

00:57:52.400 --> 00:57:56.210 align:middle line:84%
to understand the actual
nature of your reality,

00:57:56.210 --> 00:57:59.450 align:middle line:84%
and don't make too much of a
separation between the concept

00:57:59.450 --> 00:58:01.813 align:middle line:84%
of what is physical
and what is not.

00:58:01.813 --> 00:58:02.613 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:58:02.613 --> 00:58:03.420 align:middle line:90%
>> All right.

00:58:03.420 --> 00:58:05.920 align:middle line:84%
>> This planet is in quite
a lot of disarray currently.

00:58:05.920 --> 00:58:06.720 align:middle line:90%
>> Really?

00:58:06.720 --> 00:58:07.520 align:middle line:90%
Hadn't noticed.

00:58:07.520 --> 00:58:09.060 align:middle line:90%
>> No, I know.

00:58:09.060 --> 00:58:11.220 align:middle line:84%
I didn't want to shock you
too much with that one.

00:58:11.220 --> 00:58:12.720 align:middle line:90%
>> Thank you.

00:58:12.720 --> 00:58:14.130 align:middle line:90%
I am very sensitive.

00:58:14.130 --> 00:58:14.970 align:middle line:90%
>> I know you are.

00:58:14.970 --> 00:58:16.230 align:middle line:90%
[AUDIENCE LAUGHTER]

00:58:16.230 --> 00:58:20.130 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, let me give you
a little bit of a hint.

00:58:20.130 --> 00:58:23.400 align:middle line:10%
When you say this planet,
what you're actually meaning

00:58:23.400 --> 00:58:26.820 align:middle line:10%
is these planets,
because there are

00:58:26.820 --> 00:58:30.480 align:middle line:10%
a multitude of versions
of Earth right now that

00:58:30.480 --> 00:58:33.460 align:middle line:10%
exist here and now.

00:58:33.460 --> 00:58:37.030 align:middle line:10%
Don't think of it only as
a single version of Earth,

00:58:37.030 --> 00:58:41.020 align:middle line:10%
and you will start being able to
be more flexible and malleable

00:58:41.020 --> 00:58:43.810 align:middle line:10%
in moving in the direction of
the vibration of the version

00:58:43.810 --> 00:58:46.570 align:middle line:10%
of Earth that is more reflective
of who you prefer to be.

00:58:46.570 --> 00:58:51.660 align:middle line:84%
Remember, you never ever ever
change the planet you're on.

00:58:51.660 --> 00:58:54.250 align:middle line:84%
You change yourself
and shift yourself

00:58:54.250 --> 00:58:56.980 align:middle line:84%
to another version of
Earth that already exists,

00:58:56.980 --> 00:58:58.780 align:middle line:84%
that's already
more representative

00:58:58.780 --> 00:59:01.150 align:middle line:84%
of the change you
made within yourself.

00:59:01.150 --> 00:59:03.160 align:middle line:90%
The other version still exists.

00:59:03.160 --> 00:59:05.570 align:middle line:84%
You're just not
focused on it anymore.

00:59:05.570 --> 00:59:06.730 align:middle line:90%
And you're doing this.

00:59:06.730 --> 00:59:10.090 align:middle line:84%
Shifting literally--
this is not a metaphor.

00:59:10.090 --> 00:59:12.550 align:middle line:84%
You are doing this shifting
between different versions

00:59:12.550 --> 00:59:17.240 align:middle line:84%
of Earth billions
of times per second.

00:59:17.240 --> 00:59:19.963 align:middle line:84%
So it's always zero,
zero, zero, zero, zero.

00:59:19.963 --> 00:59:23.050 align:middle line:84%
The definition you
have of where you are

00:59:23.050 --> 00:59:26.560 align:middle line:84%
determines what you
actually experience.

00:59:26.560 --> 00:59:29.290 align:middle line:84%
And just because you might
be able to still observe

00:59:29.290 --> 00:59:32.770 align:middle line:84%
a reality you don't prefer
doesn't mean it effects you.

00:59:32.770 --> 00:59:34.450 align:middle line:84%
At this point on
your planet, it's

00:59:34.450 --> 00:59:36.430 align:middle line:84%
what we call the
splitting prism.

00:59:36.430 --> 00:59:39.730 align:middle line:84%
You're getting more and more
actual concrete, visceral

00:59:39.730 --> 00:59:43.060 align:middle line:84%
experience of realizing that
you can observe realities

00:59:43.060 --> 00:59:45.618 align:middle line:84%
and different versions of Earth
that aren't what you prefer,

00:59:45.618 --> 00:59:48.160 align:middle line:84%
but that you're not going to be
affected by them because it's

00:59:48.160 --> 00:59:51.550 align:middle line:84%
almost like there are glass
walls separating them all.

00:59:51.550 --> 00:59:53.440 align:middle line:84%
So you can still
see them, but they

00:59:53.440 --> 00:59:58.270 align:middle line:84%
can't get to you until you
decide to align with it.

00:59:58.270 --> 01:00:00.600 align:middle line:90%
So it's not this planet.

01:00:00.600 --> 01:00:03.610 align:middle line:84%
It's all a whole bunch of
different versions of Earth

01:00:03.610 --> 01:00:06.730 align:middle line:84%
and whatever changes you make
within yourself, over time,

01:00:06.730 --> 01:00:09.160 align:middle line:84%
ultimately determines
more and more and more

01:00:09.160 --> 01:00:12.550 align:middle line:84%
which version you will
experience and ultimately

01:00:12.550 --> 01:00:15.460 align:middle line:90%
experience nothing else.

01:00:15.460 --> 01:00:18.100 align:middle line:84%
>> Will we ever experience
like your civilization had that

01:00:18.100 --> 01:00:21.317 align:middle line:84%
Chicana moment where you
went to sleep for three days?

01:00:21.317 --> 01:00:22.150 align:middle line:90%
Will we experience--

01:00:22.150 --> 01:00:24.010 align:middle line:84%
>> You have your own
version of that idea.

01:00:24.010 --> 01:00:26.150 align:middle line:10%
Yes, it won't be
identical, but yes, you're

01:00:26.150 --> 01:00:28.360 align:middle line:10%
heading if you
make those choices

01:00:28.360 --> 01:00:31.270 align:middle line:10%
to a version of that awakening.

01:00:31.270 --> 01:00:34.510 align:middle line:84%
>> And how is the window of
contact looking currently?

01:00:34.510 --> 01:00:38.770 align:middle line:84%
>> It's looking pretty,
somewhere between again

01:00:38.770 --> 01:00:44.710 align:middle line:84%
your year of 2025, maybe
2033, 2040, at the outside.

01:00:44.710 --> 01:00:46.750 align:middle line:10%
A lot of that will
depend upon what

01:00:46.750 --> 01:00:48.520 align:middle line:10%
happens in this pivotal year.

01:00:48.520 --> 01:00:51.770 align:middle line:90%


01:00:51.770 --> 01:00:55.500 align:middle line:84%
>> And how far is your ship
above Bell Rock currently?

01:00:55.500 --> 01:00:57.726 align:middle line:90%
>> It's about 5,000 miles.

01:00:57.726 --> 01:01:00.080 align:middle line:90%
>> OK, it's dropped a bit.

01:01:00.080 --> 01:01:00.960 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

01:01:00.960 --> 01:01:02.680 align:middle line:90%
>> Good.

01:01:02.680 --> 01:01:04.230 align:middle line:10%
What's your take on--

01:01:04.230 --> 01:01:07.590 align:middle line:10%
>> The reason that question
is being asked because at one

01:01:07.590 --> 01:01:11.790 align:middle line:10%
time, we mentioned that the
distance our ship is above Bell

01:01:11.790 --> 01:01:15.390 align:middle line:10%
Rock and how much lower it gets
is actually like a barometer

01:01:15.390 --> 01:01:19.600 align:middle line:10%
of how close you're
getting to open contact.

01:01:19.600 --> 01:01:21.720 align:middle line:84%
>> And what's your
take on forgiveness?

01:01:21.720 --> 01:01:23.190 align:middle line:84%
Because for me,
I think it's kind

01:01:23.190 --> 01:01:24.440 align:middle line:90%
of the key to a lot of things.

01:01:24.440 --> 01:01:26.730 align:middle line:84%
>> We're going to talk a lot
about that in an upcoming

01:01:26.730 --> 01:01:29.320 align:middle line:84%
transmission called
The Eye of the Needle.

01:01:29.320 --> 01:01:30.120 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

01:01:30.120 --> 01:01:30.850 align:middle line:10%
And the final question--

01:01:30.850 --> 01:01:31.880 align:middle line:10%
>> That will do.

01:01:31.880 --> 01:01:33.390 align:middle line:90%
>> That is my final question.

01:01:33.390 --> 01:01:35.280 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

01:01:49.900 --> 01:01:50.700 align:middle line:90%
>> I'm sorry.

01:01:50.700 --> 01:01:51.910 align:middle line:90%
I'm a little bit nervous.

01:01:51.910 --> 01:01:52.710 align:middle line:90%
>> Why?

01:01:52.710 --> 01:01:53.510 align:middle line:90%
>> I don't know.

01:01:53.510 --> 01:01:54.845 align:middle line:90%
It's so exciting.

01:01:54.845 --> 01:01:55.970 align:middle line:90%
>> You mean you're excited?

01:01:55.970 --> 01:01:57.590 align:middle line:90%
>> I am very much.

01:01:57.590 --> 01:02:00.260 align:middle line:84%
And I want to thank you
and all of you guys,

01:02:00.260 --> 01:02:02.540 align:middle line:84%
because it's been an
amazing experience

01:02:02.540 --> 01:02:05.120 align:middle line:84%
to learn from all
of you and you,

01:02:05.120 --> 01:02:08.420 align:middle line:84%
and you are so
beautiful, all of you.

01:02:08.420 --> 01:02:09.260 align:middle line:90%
>> Why, thank you.

01:02:09.260 --> 01:02:11.570 align:middle line:90%
I'm blushing.

01:02:11.570 --> 01:02:13.800 align:middle line:90%
>> Honestly.

01:02:13.800 --> 01:02:18.140 align:middle line:84%
And just by observing people
here, I learned so much.

01:02:18.140 --> 01:02:19.650 align:middle line:90%
So thank you, all of you.

01:02:19.650 --> 01:02:23.150 align:middle line:84%
And thank you again
for coming to see us.

01:02:23.150 --> 01:02:27.630 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, thank you for
opening up so that we can.

01:02:27.630 --> 01:02:30.960 align:middle line:84%
>> My first question would
be probably about education.

01:02:30.960 --> 01:02:31.760 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

01:02:31.760 --> 01:02:36.800 align:middle line:84%
>> So I remember you
mentioned that we shall give--

01:02:36.800 --> 01:02:39.650 align:middle line:84%
we shall teach children
by giving an example,

01:02:39.650 --> 01:02:41.150 align:middle line:90%
by setting an example.

01:02:41.150 --> 01:02:44.510 align:middle line:84%
>> There are three main ideas to
the idea of educating children

01:02:44.510 --> 01:02:46.010 align:middle line:84%
that we have shared
with all of you.

01:02:46.010 --> 01:02:51.590 align:middle line:10%
Number one, as the educator,
as the adult, as the teacher,

01:02:51.590 --> 01:02:53.900 align:middle line:10%
have the imagination
and the wherewithal

01:02:53.900 --> 01:02:57.800 align:middle line:10%
to create safe spaces
in which children

01:02:57.800 --> 01:03:00.560 align:middle line:10%
can learn the consequences
of their choices,

01:03:00.560 --> 01:03:05.030 align:middle line:10%
safely, without trying
them out in the world.

01:03:05.030 --> 01:03:07.310 align:middle line:84%
Then they will understand
how to align themselves

01:03:07.310 --> 01:03:08.810 align:middle line:90%
with those choices.

01:03:08.810 --> 01:03:10.310 align:middle line:84%
Number two, teach
them that they are

01:03:10.310 --> 01:03:13.760 align:middle line:84%
as powerful as they need to be
to create whatever they need

01:03:13.760 --> 01:03:16.970 align:middle line:84%
in life without having to
hurt themselves or anyone else

01:03:16.970 --> 01:03:19.100 align:middle line:90%
in order to do so.

01:03:19.100 --> 01:03:19.900 align:middle line:10%
Yes?

01:03:19.900 --> 01:03:20.700 align:middle line:10%
>> Yes.

01:03:20.700 --> 01:03:23.260 align:middle line:10%
>> And number three, anything
you believe is important

01:03:23.260 --> 01:03:27.160 align:middle line:10%
for them to learn about being
in physical reality on Earth,

01:03:27.160 --> 01:03:29.860 align:middle line:10%
a lesson you believe it's
important for them to have,

01:03:29.860 --> 01:03:34.900 align:middle line:10%
to learn, adapt the
lesson to their passion.

01:03:34.900 --> 01:03:38.860 align:middle line:84%
Don't diminish their
passion into the lesson.

01:03:38.860 --> 01:03:40.540 align:middle line:84%
Those three things
will allow you

01:03:40.540 --> 01:03:45.560 align:middle line:84%
to develop mature,
balanced, creative adults.

01:03:45.560 --> 01:03:46.360 align:middle line:90%
>> Beautiful.

01:03:46.360 --> 01:03:47.160 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

01:03:47.160 --> 01:03:49.210 align:middle line:90%

Question about
not only children.

01:03:51.790 --> 01:03:54.610 align:middle line:84%
Let's talk about
our institutions

01:03:54.610 --> 01:03:55.770 align:middle line:90%
all over the world.

01:03:55.770 --> 01:03:59.210 align:middle line:84%
As we know, they have a
lot of false information.

01:03:59.210 --> 01:04:03.670 align:middle line:84%
So would you recommend the best
way of choosing the proper--

01:04:03.670 --> 01:04:05.140 align:middle line:90%
>> Create new systems.

01:04:05.140 --> 01:04:06.650 align:middle line:90%
>> That's right.

01:04:06.650 --> 01:04:08.260 align:middle line:90%
>> Create new systems.

01:04:08.260 --> 01:04:09.940 align:middle line:84%
If you don't
create, new systems,

01:04:09.940 --> 01:04:12.780 align:middle line:84%
what's going to
replace the old one?

01:04:12.780 --> 01:04:16.820 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, let's say today,
I'm coming out of this expo,

01:04:16.820 --> 01:04:19.200 align:middle line:90%
how do I create a new system?

01:04:19.200 --> 01:04:22.250 align:middle line:84%
>> Did I not just give you three
basic fundamentals that would

01:04:22.250 --> 01:04:23.910 align:middle line:84%
go into a new
educational system?

01:04:23.910 --> 01:04:25.460 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes, you did.

01:04:25.460 --> 01:04:27.800 align:middle line:90%
>> Then what's stopping you?

01:04:27.800 --> 01:04:28.630 align:middle line:90%
>> True.

01:04:28.630 --> 01:04:29.470 align:middle line:90%

to forgive my mom.

01:11:29.130 --> 01:11:31.720 align:middle line:90%
My parents got divorced.

01:11:31.720 --> 01:11:32.520 align:middle line:90%
>> All right.

01:11:32.520 --> 01:11:33.630 align:middle line:90%
Well, that seems clear.

01:11:33.630 --> 01:11:38.760 align:middle line:84%
>> And my mom wasn't
the one took us.

01:11:38.760 --> 01:11:41.250 align:middle line:90%
And another one is my chakra--

01:11:41.250 --> 01:11:43.170 align:middle line:90%
>> Chakras, yes.

01:11:43.170 --> 01:11:44.890 align:middle line:90%
>> Has been blooming.

01:11:44.890 --> 01:11:48.090 align:middle line:90%
But it's not there yet.

01:11:48.090 --> 01:11:50.970 align:middle line:84%
And try to open that up,
but I don't know how.

01:11:50.970 --> 01:11:52.390 align:middle line:90%
>> Forgive.

01:11:52.390 --> 01:11:53.410 align:middle line:90%
It'll open.

01:11:53.410 --> 01:11:54.210 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

01:11:54.210 --> 01:11:55.140 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

01:11:55.140 --> 01:11:56.920 align:middle line:90%
Are you able to do that?

01:11:56.920 --> 01:11:57.720 align:middle line:90%
>> Think so.

01:11:57.720 --> 01:11:58.920 align:middle line:90%
>> Are you able to let go?

01:11:58.920 --> 01:11:59.720 align:middle line:90%
>> I think so.

01:11:59.720 --> 01:12:02.940 align:middle line:84%
Is that something I have to be
at a certain place back home,

01:12:02.940 --> 01:12:04.680 align:middle line:90%
or I can do here?

01:12:04.680 --> 01:12:06.300 align:middle line:84%
>> No, everything
is here and now.

01:12:06.300 --> 01:12:07.480 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

01:12:07.480 --> 01:12:12.650 align:middle line:84%
>> It's up to you to be the
state that allows you to take

01:12:12.650 --> 01:12:14.700 align:middle line:90%
the actions you prefer today.

01:12:14.700 --> 01:12:15.720 align:middle line:90%
Yes?

01:12:15.720 --> 01:12:16.520 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

01:12:16.520 --> 01:12:17.500 align:middle line:90%
>> Does that help you?

01:12:17.500 --> 01:12:17.690 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

01:12:17.690 --> 01:12:18.810 align:middle line:90%
>> Do you understand?

01:12:18.810 --> 01:12:19.610 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

01:12:19.610 --> 01:12:20.540 align:middle line:90%
>> Are you sure?

01:12:20.540 --> 01:12:21.340 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

01:12:21.340 --> 01:12:22.160 align:middle line:90%
>> All right.

01:12:22.160 --> 01:12:23.000 align:middle line:90%
>> Thank you.

01:12:23.000 --> 01:12:23.800 align:middle line:90%
>> Good day.

01:12:23.800 --> 01:12:25.795 align:middle line:90%
[APPLAUSE]

01:12:25.795 --> 01:12:30.650 align:middle line:90%


01:12:30.650 --> 01:12:31.610 align:middle line:90%
>> Hello, Bashar.

01:12:31.610 --> 01:12:33.410 align:middle line:90%
>> And to you, good day.

01:12:33.410 --> 01:12:37.250 align:middle line:84%
>> So in the recent past, you've
greatly encouraged us to get

01:12:37.250 --> 01:12:41.450 align:middle line:84%
out and vote as a means of
changing our trajectory toward

01:12:41.450 --> 01:12:46.700 align:middle line:84%
a problem or a similar
fate as your civilization.

01:12:46.700 --> 01:12:50.960 align:middle line:10%
In memory, we've had elections,
like in the '80s, where we

01:12:50.960 --> 01:12:54.590 align:middle line:10%
voted, and then there were some
shenanigans and papers were

01:12:54.590 --> 01:12:56.290 align:middle line:10%
missing, and there was--

01:12:56.290 --> 01:12:57.090 align:middle line:10%
>> Shenanigans.

01:12:57.090 --> 01:12:58.560 align:middle line:90%
>> Shenanigans.

01:12:58.560 --> 01:13:02.090 align:middle line:84%
And all sorts of
whatever that we're

01:13:02.090 --> 01:13:05.480 align:middle line:84%
not exactly sure that what
we've actually put out

01:13:05.480 --> 01:13:08.820 align:middle line:84%
and voted for actually happened
the way we wanted it to happen.

01:13:08.820 --> 01:13:11.240 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, it happened in
some version of Earth.

01:13:11.240 --> 01:13:14.450 align:middle line:84%
Are you in that one
or some other version?

01:13:14.450 --> 01:13:17.180 align:middle line:84%
>> Oh, well, I'm in the one
that was full of shenanigans,

01:13:17.180 --> 01:13:18.410 align:middle line:90%
I guess.

01:13:18.410 --> 01:13:19.670 align:middle line:90%
>> But maybe not.

01:13:19.670 --> 01:13:23.250 align:middle line:10%
Maybe you only observed the one
that was full of shenanigans,

01:13:23.250 --> 01:13:24.710 align:middle line:10%
but believed you
were in that one

01:13:24.710 --> 01:13:27.770 align:middle line:10%
when you didn't have
to be in that belief.

01:13:27.770 --> 01:13:30.140 align:middle line:84%
You could have seen it
and said this is not

01:13:30.140 --> 01:13:32.930 align:middle line:84%
the reality I prefer
and therefore started

01:13:32.930 --> 01:13:36.308 align:middle line:84%
acting like you were no
longer in that reality.

01:13:36.308 --> 01:13:38.600 align:middle line:84%
>> Would that have changed
the results of the election?

01:13:38.600 --> 01:13:41.390 align:middle line:84%
>> It would have
changed your experience.

01:13:41.390 --> 01:13:45.560 align:middle line:84%
You see, this is very important
to wrap your minds around.

01:13:45.560 --> 01:13:47.360 align:middle line:84%
When you truly
understand what we're

01:13:47.360 --> 01:13:51.020 align:middle line:84%
saying about how you're
shifting all the time,

01:13:51.020 --> 01:13:55.070 align:middle line:84%
if there is really no purpose
anymore in you perceiving

01:13:55.070 --> 01:13:57.440 align:middle line:84%
something from a reality
you don't prefer,

01:13:57.440 --> 01:13:59.430 align:middle line:90%
you won't perceive it.

01:13:59.430 --> 01:14:01.640 align:middle line:10%
If you're still perceiving
it, then maybe there's

01:14:01.640 --> 01:14:03.260 align:middle line:10%
still some
information there that

01:14:03.260 --> 01:14:05.330 align:middle line:10%
can be to your
benefit or a lesson

01:14:05.330 --> 01:14:08.660 align:middle line:10%
to be learned from it that
helps guide you in the direction

01:14:08.660 --> 01:14:09.980 align:middle line:10%
you do prefer.

01:14:09.980 --> 01:14:12.230 align:middle line:84%
But the point is,
is you can and are

01:14:12.230 --> 01:14:15.410 align:middle line:84%
capable of shifting yourself
and redefining yourself

01:14:15.410 --> 01:14:17.720 align:middle line:84%
at any given moment
to such a degree

01:14:17.720 --> 01:14:19.940 align:middle line:84%
that you might literally,
instantaneously

01:14:19.940 --> 01:14:21.740 align:middle line:90%
experience a different reality.

01:14:21.740 --> 01:14:24.440 align:middle line:84%
Don't judge yourself or
invalidate yourself if you

01:14:24.440 --> 01:14:25.950 align:middle line:90%
don't.

01:14:25.950 --> 01:14:29.400 align:middle line:84%
But the idea is that you
are always in a new reality,

01:14:29.400 --> 01:14:32.970 align:middle line:84%
always, as we said, billions
of times per second.

01:14:32.970 --> 01:14:35.090 align:middle line:10%
So the idea is to simply
wrap your mind around

01:14:35.090 --> 01:14:38.570 align:middle line:10%
how you wish to
use what happens.

01:14:38.570 --> 01:14:42.830 align:middle line:10%
Remember, it doesn't
matter what happens.

01:14:42.830 --> 01:14:45.860 align:middle line:10%
It only matters what
you do with what

01:14:45.860 --> 01:14:49.310 align:middle line:10%
happens that makes the
difference in your reality.

01:14:49.310 --> 01:14:55.460 align:middle line:10%
So don't base your state of
being on what's happening.

01:14:55.460 --> 01:14:58.310 align:middle line:84%
Just be the state
of being you prefer

01:14:58.310 --> 01:15:01.430 align:middle line:84%
and behave the way you
prefer to behave, no matter

01:15:01.430 --> 01:15:04.640 align:middle line:84%
what you perceive, even if it's
something you don't prefer.

01:15:04.640 --> 01:15:07.250 align:middle line:84%
Otherwise, you're just matching
the frequency of that thing

01:15:07.250 --> 01:15:10.435 align:middle line:84%
by saying it affects
me that this happened.

01:15:10.435 --> 01:15:14.660 align:middle line:84%
No, it doesn't until
you agree that it does.

01:15:14.660 --> 01:15:16.880 align:middle line:90%
Is this helping?

01:15:16.880 --> 01:15:18.330 align:middle line:90%
>> Whoa.

01:15:18.330 --> 01:15:19.130 align:middle line:90%
OK.

01:15:19.130 --> 01:15:22.170 align:middle line:90%
>> Was that a yes?

01:15:22.170 --> 01:15:23.210 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

01:15:23.210 --> 01:15:25.020 align:middle line:90%
>> But--

01:15:25.020 --> 01:15:27.830 align:middle line:84%
>> And then here we go again
with the same situation.

01:15:27.830 --> 01:15:28.630 align:middle line:90%
It's always--

01:15:28.630 --> 01:15:29.280 align:middle line:90%
>> Again--

01:15:29.280 --> 01:15:30.180 align:middle line:90%
>> Just ignore.

01:15:30.180 --> 01:15:32.130 align:middle line:84%
>> No, no we're
not saying ignore.

01:15:32.130 --> 01:15:35.310 align:middle line:10%
We're saying observe
and learn and act

01:15:35.310 --> 01:15:37.200 align:middle line:10%
in the direction you prefer.

01:15:37.200 --> 01:15:41.100 align:middle line:10%
Take the actions you are capable
of taking in the direction

01:15:41.100 --> 01:15:44.070 align:middle line:10%
and in the state of
being you prefer to.

01:15:44.070 --> 01:15:45.930 align:middle line:10%
That's what we're saying.

01:15:45.930 --> 01:15:49.350 align:middle line:10%
Remember, anything
can serve double duty.

01:15:49.350 --> 01:15:53.220 align:middle line:84%
I'll put it in the way that
I put it before generically

01:15:53.220 --> 01:15:54.990 align:middle line:90%
so that you understand.

01:15:54.990 --> 01:15:57.990 align:middle line:10%
We already told you that
we sense the buildup

01:15:57.990 --> 01:16:01.110 align:middle line:10%
that everything would
change in your year of 2016.

01:16:01.110 --> 01:16:03.390 align:middle line:90%
Clearly, it did.

01:16:03.390 --> 01:16:06.130 align:middle line:84%
But the idea can be looked
at from any particular point

01:16:06.130 --> 01:16:06.930 align:middle line:90%
of view.

01:16:06.930 --> 01:16:10.080 align:middle line:10%
You can say, all right, this
is something I don't prefer,

01:16:10.080 --> 01:16:13.320 align:middle line:10%
but I can look at it in
a different way, too.

01:16:13.320 --> 01:16:16.830 align:middle line:84%
You can say, well, we
were sort of swimming down

01:16:16.830 --> 01:16:20.130 align:middle line:84%
a gentle stream,
all smooth, and then

01:16:20.130 --> 01:16:23.100 align:middle line:84%
suddenly, something really
unexpected happened,

01:16:23.100 --> 01:16:25.426 align:middle line:90%
and now we're in the rapids.

01:16:25.426 --> 01:16:27.870 align:middle line:90%
[AUDIENCE LAUGHTER]

01:16:27.870 --> 01:16:31.020 align:middle line:84%
The fact that something
so unexpected happened

01:16:31.020 --> 01:16:33.390 align:middle line:90%
means anything can happen.

01:16:33.390 --> 01:16:34.650 align:middle line:90%
All bets are off.

01:16:34.650 --> 01:16:39.270 align:middle line:84%
You've unlocked from the
idea of any particular thing

01:16:39.270 --> 01:16:40.950 align:middle line:90%
having to happen.

01:16:40.950 --> 01:16:43.530 align:middle line:84%
So use that momentum
to your advantage

01:16:43.530 --> 01:16:46.620 align:middle line:84%
because if you're in
the rapids, but you

01:16:46.620 --> 01:16:50.010 align:middle line:84%
learn how to ride the
rapids, what happens?

01:16:50.010 --> 01:16:54.780 align:middle line:84%
You get downstream faster than
you ever would have before.

01:16:54.780 --> 01:16:59.370 align:middle line:84%
So use the energy in
the way you prefer to,

01:16:59.370 --> 01:17:03.830 align:middle line:84%
not necessarily in the
way others are using it.

01:17:03.830 --> 01:17:06.320 align:middle line:90%
You have that power.

01:17:06.320 --> 01:17:07.290 align:middle line:90%
Apply it.

01:17:07.290 --> 01:17:07.860 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

01:17:07.860 --> 01:17:08.570 align:middle line:90%
>> Is that helping?

01:17:08.570 --> 01:17:09.350 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

01:17:09.350 --> 01:17:09.860 align:middle line:90%
>> All right.

01:17:09.860 --> 01:17:10.910 align:middle line:90%
>> Wonderful.

01:17:10.910 --> 01:17:11.210 align:middle line:90%
All right.

01:17:11.210 --> 01:17:11.940 align:middle line:90%
Thank you very much.

01:17:11.940 --> 01:17:12.740 align:middle line:90%

address that please?

supposed to address?

at a different time than

don't know that.

originally in North America had
